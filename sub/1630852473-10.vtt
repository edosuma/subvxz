ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.421 --> 00:06.506
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:07.257 --> 00:09.259
(lively music)

00:11.511 --> 00:12.679
(elephants trumpeting)

00:19.060 --> 00:20.228
MAN 1: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.645 --> 00:21.771
(moans)

00:21.855 --> 00:23.189
(screaming)

00:31.281 --> 00:34.826
NARRATOR: <i>Ah. Here they are.
The Presidents of the United States.</i>

00:34.909 --> 00:36.036
My fellow Americans...

00:36.119 --> 00:38.663
NARRATOR: <i>This one here is George W. Bush.</i>

00:38.747 --> 00:39.706
All righty.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.208
NARRATOR: <i>Here he is dancing
and casually moving around.</i>

00:42.292 --> 00:45.170
-Again and again, we return...
-NARRATOR: <i>Whoa. He's a robot!</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:49.966
<i>Whoa. They're all robots!
Oh. So realistic.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:51.176
-All righty, then.
-Perfect.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.844
-Looking forward to seeing myself.
-MAN 2: Okay.

00:52.927 --> 00:56.181
NARRATOR: <i>But don't worry.
This is just what some presidents do</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:59.017
<i>to be in The Hall of Presidents
at Walt Disney World,</i>

00:59.100 --> 01:03.730
<i>featuring every American president
all under one roof.</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:05.607
<i>And the incredible history</i>

01:05.690 --> 01:09.110
<i>of these Audio-Animatronics
leaders of the free world</i>

01:09.194 --> 01:12.781
<i>is one of great moments
and great struggle.</i>

01:12.864 --> 01:16.409
Mr. Lincoln was a terrible disaster.

01:16.493 --> 01:21.164
NARRATOR: <i>This is a story
where patriotism, astounding technology,</i>

01:21.247 --> 01:22.832
<i>and the American Dream...</i>

01:22.916 --> 01:24.250
All men are created equal.

01:24.334 --> 01:28.546
<i>...come together to form
perhaps Walt Disney's greatest dream.</i>

01:28.630 --> 01:29.714
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>The Hall of Presidents.</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:32.258
-NARRATOR: <i>A dream many thought was...</i>
-Impossible.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.637
WALT: <i>Behind our liberties,
there's an interesting story.</i>

01:36.262 --> 01:37.764
NARRATOR: <i>A story made possible</i>

01:37.847 --> 01:41.768
<i>by the grit and determination
of one Mr. Disney himself.</i>

01:41.893 --> 01:44.104
<i>But not that one, this one.</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:45.897
<i>Walt's older brother, Roy.</i>

01:45.980 --> 01:48.650
<i>And we really can't tell
this story without him.</i>

01:48.733 --> 01:52.987
Walt got the credit for being
the creative genius that he really was,

01:53.071 --> 01:55.532
but I don't think
Roy always got the credit

01:55.615 --> 01:57.826
for being the financial genius
that he was.

01:57.909 --> 02:02.080
NARRATOR: <i>Although, that said,
he did do a lot of unpaid labor</i>

02:02.163 --> 02:04.874
<i>in the form of babysitting
his little brother, Walt.</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:07.919
<i>At least according to Roy's son, Roy.</i>

02:08.002 --> 02:11.297
Dad, as everybody knows,
was older than Walt by years,

02:11.381 --> 02:14.217
<i>and the babysitting responsibility
that never left him</i>

02:14.300 --> 02:17.220
<i>from the time Walt was born
carried him through,</i>

02:17.303 --> 02:19.222
<i>and I think it was a sense of duty.</i>

02:19.305 --> 02:21.432
NARRATOR: <i>A sense of duty
that followed the brothers</i>

02:21.516 --> 02:23.351
<i>as they took their show on the road,</i>

02:23.434 --> 02:25.812
<i>from Kansas City all the way to Hollywood.</i>

02:25.895 --> 02:29.315
GARY: <i>It's not surprising
they had a professional relationship</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:33.361
that really modeled
the Hollywood studio system. Right?

02:33.444 --> 02:36.114
<i>You often have a creative director,</i>

02:36.197 --> 02:40.201
<i>and then you'll have a delivery producer
who helps make that vision happen.</i>

02:40.285 --> 02:43.329
And that was absolutely the relationship
between Walt and Roy

02:43.413 --> 02:45.707
from early in their careers together.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.418
NARRATOR:
<i>And it was Walt Disney's creative visions</i>

02:48.501 --> 02:54.591
<i>that turned this tiny animation studio
into an Academy Award-winning powerhouse.</i>

02:54.674 --> 02:56.301
Aren't you proud of it, Mr. Disney?

02:56.384 --> 02:58.761
Why, I'm so proud, I think I'll bust.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.514
NARRATOR: <i>But the Disney brothers
were just getting started.</i>

03:01.598 --> 03:04.350
<i>Because, as we all know
by this point in the series,</i>

03:04.434 --> 03:08.479
<i>Walt Disney had dreams
that far exceeded the Hollywood studios.</i>

03:08.563 --> 03:11.399
Walt began dreaming a little bit bigger.

03:11.482 --> 03:15.028
NARRATOR: <i>And, as always,
Walt's big brother Roy was there</i>

03:15.111 --> 03:17.780
<i>to make his little brother's dreams
come true.</i>

03:17.864 --> 03:20.158
And I think what you see is many examples

03:20.241 --> 03:24.412
of Roy hearing some idea from Walt
that might have sounded crazy,

03:24.495 --> 03:26.247
<i>and did sound crazy to a lot of people,</i>

03:26.331 --> 03:28.791
<i>but Roy was the one
who believed in them, believed in Walt,</i>

03:28.875 --> 03:31.544
and found out what he needed
to do to make it happen.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.837
NARRATOR: <i>And Roy knew, </i>

03:32.921 --> 03:37.258
<i>probably better than anyone,
that many of Walt's crazy ideas</i>

03:37.342 --> 03:40.011
<i>were actually based around
a guiding principle.</i>

03:40.094 --> 03:44.098
Walt's unique understanding
of the bond between...

03:44.182 --> 03:46.309
-NARRATOR: <i>Brothers?</i>
-...education and entertainment.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.853
NARRATOR: <i>In fact, in a kind of decree...</i>

03:48.937 --> 03:50.396
GARY: <i>And what Walt said was,</i>

03:50.480 --> 03:53.858
<i>"We have always tried to be guided
by the basic idea</i>

03:53.942 --> 03:58.696
that in the discovery of knowledge,
there is great entertainment.

03:58.780 --> 04:03.785
But in all good entertainment,
there is some grain of wisdom, humanity,

04:03.868 --> 04:05.870
or enlightenment to be gained."

04:05.954 --> 04:07.830
NARRATOR: <i>And with this noble philosophy,</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:11.209
<i>Walt's creativity was driven
by a simple goal.</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:16.339
The intention of these stories
are to educate,

04:16.422 --> 04:19.092
uh, stimulate, and to entertain.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.052
NARRATOR:
<i>A philosophy that would be realized</i>

04:21.135 --> 04:27.475
<i>when Walt and Roy Disney created
the very first Audio-Animatronics man!</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:29.143
<i>Eventually.</i>

04:29.227 --> 04:31.229
<i>Eh, maybe just sit back down for a second.</i>

04:31.312 --> 04:36.109
<i>Because Walt Disney's philosophy,
whether he knew it or not,</i>

04:36.192 --> 04:38.111
<i>started at a very young age.</i>

04:38.194 --> 04:40.446
Ever since I was a small boy in Illinois,

04:40.530 --> 04:43.783
I've had a great personal admiration
for Abraham Lincoln.

04:43.866 --> 04:48.121
And even as a boy, there are stories
about how he went to school one day

04:48.204 --> 04:50.873
dressed as Lincoln
with a top hat and everything,

04:50.957 --> 04:52.959
<i>and he was very intrigued</i>

04:53.042 --> 04:56.587
both with Lincoln
and with the American presidency.

04:56.671 --> 04:57.797
NARRATOR: <i>So much so that...</i>

04:57.880 --> 05:01.175
He developed a concept,
in The Hall of Presidents,

05:01.259 --> 05:04.220
a show about
the Presidents of the United States.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.681
NARRATOR: <i>An idea that may well
have been inspired</i>

05:06.764 --> 05:11.811
<i>by something the public saw
at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago.</i>

05:11.894 --> 05:14.272
BILL: <i>It was a show there
with all the presidents,</i>

05:14.355 --> 05:15.648
<i>basically wax figures,</i>

05:15.732 --> 05:18.443
but they were all speaking
with recorded voices

05:18.526 --> 05:20.361
about, you know,
their role in American history.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.322
WASHINGTON (automated voice):
<i>Hello, I'm George Washington.</i>

05:22.405 --> 05:24.073
They were pretty much static figures.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.826
But Walt now thought,
"Oh, I can make these guys come to life."

05:26.909 --> 05:28.328
WASHINGTON (automated voice):
<i>Come to life?</i>

05:28.411 --> 05:30.955
NARRATOR: <i>Or at least come to life
for a 10-hour shift.</i>

05:31.039 --> 05:37.253
He knew that you couldn't get an actor
to stand up every 12 minutes

05:37.337 --> 05:39.964
and make the same speech.
It was impossible.

05:40.048 --> 05:44.218
NARRATOR: <i>Come on. This is Walt Disney.
Nothing is impossible. Instead...</i>

05:44.302 --> 05:46.429
You come over here,
and I'll give you a little preview.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.555
I should say.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.766
NARRATOR: <i>Walt wanted to find some way</i>

05:49.849 --> 05:53.102
<i>to make robotic representations
of the presidents.</i>

05:53.186 --> 05:55.813
They wanted them to stand up
and to sit down, and...

05:55.897 --> 05:58.399
That was all very complex.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.944
NARRATOR: <i>And from Roy's perspective?
Very expensive.</i>

06:02.028 --> 06:03.780
<i>But to Walt Disney, the term...</i>

06:03.863 --> 06:04.989
Very complex.

06:05.073 --> 06:10.536
<i>...was as daunting as a morning coffee,
because for him, these impossible figures</i>

06:10.620 --> 06:13.456
<i>weren't just a way
to bring presidents to life,</i>

06:13.539 --> 06:17.210
<i>but merely the next step
in his constant pursuit of innovation.</i>

06:17.293 --> 06:20.963
See, our whole 40-some-odd years here
has been in the world

06:21.047 --> 06:23.674
of making things move,
inanimate things move.

06:23.758 --> 06:27.220
It was kind of a through line from back
in his early days in animation,

06:27.303 --> 06:31.015
<i>about trying to take what is static
and not moving and bringing life to it.</i>

06:31.099 --> 06:32.433
He's gonna try to do this with a person.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.060
Yes, with human beings. Yeah.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.313
NARRATOR: <i>But unlike traditional
hand-drawn cell animation,</i>

06:37.397 --> 06:40.024
<i>which relies on skill and manpower,</i>

06:40.108 --> 06:44.320
<i>powering robotic man
to a level of finesse and nuance</i>

06:44.404 --> 06:49.117
<i>that Walt had achieved in animation...
well, in the late '50s...</i>

06:49.200 --> 06:53.746
What a crazy assignment that would be,
to be able to just bring these characters

06:53.830 --> 06:56.958
that they've all, you know, been working
with animation and with film for so long,

06:57.542 --> 07:01.963
and bring them into a third dimension
for guests to come face-to-face with?

07:02.046 --> 07:03.339
That's a huge task.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.217
NARRATOR:
<i>But there was a plan to get this done.</i>

07:06.300 --> 07:11.222
<i>Or, at least, some concept art
and a map of where to put his presidents.</i>

07:11.305 --> 07:15.351
Right here, off the town square.
We're calling it Liberty Street.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.103
NARRATOR: <i>That's right, Liberty Street.</i>

07:17.186 --> 07:20.898
WALT: But our research has taken us back
to a period we'd like to recreate

07:20.982 --> 07:25.945
as a reminder that The Liberty Story
is a story without end.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.115
NARRATOR: <i>And a story without a beginning.</i>

07:29.198 --> 07:30.158
We never built it.

07:30.241 --> 07:34.203
NARRATOR: <i>Because, just like
his robotic presidents, Liberty Street...</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:37.498
It's going to cost 4.4 million dollars.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.626
-NARRATOR: <i>And Roy said...</i>
-"But where am I gonna get the money?"

07:40.710 --> 07:44.297
NARRATOR: <i>With these expensive ideas
being well beyond their budget...</i>

07:44.380 --> 07:48.509
Walt needs to be able to raise money
to be able to build large projects.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.554
NARRATOR: <i>And there was one other way
he could do that.</i>

07:51.637 --> 07:55.683
He thinks that if he can get sponsors
to underwrite this,

07:55.766 --> 07:58.352
then he can create this for Disneyland.

07:58.436 --> 08:03.858
NARRATOR: <i>And why not? On its opening day,
Disneyland had over 40 sponsors.</i>

08:03.941 --> 08:05.818
MAN 3: <i>Say, look, kids. We're on!</i>

08:05.902 --> 08:06.903
NARRATOR: <i>And, after all,</i>

08:06.986 --> 08:09.447
<i>this is the great Walt Disney
we're talking about.</i>

08:09.530 --> 08:11.782
Walt, you've made a bum
out of Barnum today.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.868
NARRATOR:
<i>One of the most famous names in the world.</i>

08:13.951 --> 08:18.498
Walt Disney chose Swift to supply poultry
and meat for all Disneyland exclusively.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.625
NARRATOR: <i>However, even with Roy's help...</i>

08:20.708 --> 08:25.463
Walt is unable to get sponsors
for either of these attractions.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.632
TODD: <i>He thinks
part of the problem might be</i>

08:27.715 --> 08:30.676
<i>that Disney is seen
as an entertainment business,</i>

08:30.760 --> 08:34.013
and this is now an educational project
that he's putting forward.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.723
NARRATOR: <i>Much to his disappointment,</i>

08:35.806 --> 08:39.268
<i>Walt couldn't secure the funding
for either The Hall of Presidents</i>

08:39.352 --> 08:41.312
<i>or Liberty Street. However...</i>

08:41.395 --> 08:43.439
Unbeknownst to a lot of people
in the studio,

08:43.523 --> 08:46.025
Walt had a little secret room
at the machine shop

08:46.108 --> 08:49.195
where some guys were working
on this animated human.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.781
NARRATOR:
<i>So, with the express purpose of creating</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:54.825
<i>what would ultimately become
The Hall of Presidents,</i>

08:54.909 --> 08:56.869
<i>Walt assigned a small team</i>

08:56.953 --> 09:01.249
<i>to develop a method
of creating a form of robotic animation</i>

09:01.332 --> 09:04.669
<i>that could bring every president
from history to life.</i>

09:04.752 --> 09:07.421
<i>Or not quite every president.</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:10.341
And it quickly became obvious that,
let's just do one

09:10.800 --> 09:13.886
and do it well
to prove out the technology.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.806
NARRATOR: <i>But doing it well
was easier said than done.</i>

09:16.889 --> 09:20.101
Walt was really upset.
He showed us this Lincoln,

09:20.643 --> 09:23.813
<i>and it was very heavy
and had hydraulic leaks in it.</i>

09:23.896 --> 09:24.897
LINCOLN (animated voice): No.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.567
BOB: <i>And I remember he looked
at this thing and he says,</i>

09:27.650 --> 09:31.988
"Bobby, I want twice as many motions
and half as much weight. Can you do that?"

09:32.071 --> 09:33.823
<i>And it was obviously
another one of the jobs</i>

09:33.906 --> 09:35.241
where you say, "Yeah. I'll start."

09:35.324 --> 09:40.037
NARRATOR: <i>Burning through a fair amount
of cash and hydraulic fluid,</i>

09:40.121 --> 09:41.914
<i>by the early '60s,</i>

09:41.998 --> 09:46.252
<i>it was looking like Walt's dream
to create Audio-Animatronics man...</i>

09:46.335 --> 09:48.087
Yes, with human beings. Yeah.

09:48.170 --> 09:51.424
<i>...might just stay for the birds.</i>

09:51.507 --> 09:54.760
-Audio-Animatronics?
-Right, Audio-Animatronics.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.471
NARRATOR: <i>But then, suddenly,
as if by magic,</i>

09:57.555 --> 09:59.307
<i>a solution appeared in the form of...</i>

09:59.390 --> 10:01.309
The 1964-65 World's Fair.

10:01.392 --> 10:05.021
<i>A world away from the innocent family fun
of Disneyland,</i>

10:05.104 --> 10:07.857
<i>the New York World's Fair
promised to be...</i>

10:07.940 --> 10:09.734
Greatest World's Fair of all time.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.902
NARRATOR: <i>So, Walt wasted no time</i>

10:11.986 --> 10:14.572
<i>in proposing his idea for Lincoln. And...</i>

10:14.655 --> 10:17.158
Disney and the State of Illinois come
to an agreement

10:17.241 --> 10:20.328
where the Lincoln figure is gonna be
the centerpiece attraction

10:20.411 --> 10:21.329
at their pavilion.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.414
NARRATOR: <i>So, with a new lease on life,</i>

10:23.497 --> 10:28.461
<i>and, most importantly, sponsorship
to help him develop his Abe Lincoln,</i>

10:28.544 --> 10:33.966
<i>Walt Disney had officially entered
the 1964-65 World's Fair.</i>

10:34.050 --> 10:35.760
And within 90 days, I had...

10:35.843 --> 10:38.638
I drew up all the parts in that thing
and had it all figured out.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.972
BOB: <i>It finally worked.</i>

10:40.473 --> 10:43.184
And you could see that
Walt had that twinkle in his eye like,

10:43.267 --> 10:44.977
"Look, world. Look what I just did."

10:45.061 --> 10:46.103
(dings)

10:46.854 --> 10:48.481
NARRATOR: <i>And in the run-up to the Fair,</i>

10:48.564 --> 10:51.776
<i>Walt and the Imagineers
put everything they had</i>

10:51.859 --> 10:55.488
<i>into creating a robot
that could do what a real person can do.</i>

10:55.571 --> 10:58.532
<i>And it doesn't just end
with the mechanical bits.</i>

10:58.616 --> 11:03.788
There's a method to how we control
the motion of the character, uh...

11:03.871 --> 11:08.334
How, uh... Let's say how your eyes lead
before your head turns.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.420
TANNER: <i>How we observe
how life actually behaves.</i>

11:11.504 --> 11:16.092
You can't necessarily just adopt
pure robotics as a technology.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.720
You have to adapt it to a story
and to a character.

11:19.804 --> 11:20.805
NARRATOR: <i>Exactly.</i>

11:20.888 --> 11:25.559
<i>It turns out, bringing these guys to life
is actually quite the art form.</i>

11:25.643 --> 11:26.852
'Cause, at the end of the day,

11:26.936 --> 11:31.607
our goal is to be able to make
an emotional connection with the guest.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.486
NARRATOR: <i>But first, they'd have to get
their incredible Lincoln figure</i>

11:35.569 --> 11:38.114
<i>to New York City
in time for the World's Fair.</i>

11:38.739 --> 11:40.866
<i>Although packed with modern marvels,</i>

11:40.950 --> 11:44.954
<i>all eyes were on Walt's</i> Great Moments
with Mr. Lincoln.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.080
JIMMY: <i>As a five-year-old,</i>

11:46.163 --> 11:48.708
World's Fair was right down the street
from where we lived,

11:48.791 --> 11:53.087
and the first thing we waited in line
and went to go see was Mr. Lincoln.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.464
NARRATOR: <i>But when Lincoln stood up
to give his address...</i>

11:55.548 --> 11:58.217
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
President Abraham Lincoln.</i>

11:58.300 --> 12:00.553
NARRATOR: <i>...he wasn't quite ready-sberg.</i>

12:02.221 --> 12:04.473
Sorry. Nobody's gonna see this. Not ready.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.184
NARRATOR:
<i>And, as opening day came and went...</i>

12:07.268 --> 12:11.480
They can't get Lincoln to move
through its programming successfully.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.816
-NARRATOR: <i>In other words...</i>
-Terrible disaster.

12:13.899 --> 12:17.319
NARRATOR: <i>Distinctly not</i> "Great Moments
with Mr. Lincoln."

12:17.403 --> 12:21.282
<i>In fact, Walt's dream to create
The Hall of Presidents</i>

12:21.365 --> 12:25.619
<i>one president at a time
couldn't be over, could it?</i>

12:25.703 --> 12:28.247
Mr. Lincoln was sitting in his chair,
and he started to get up.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.667
And all of a sudden,
he was going into this robotic fit.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.753
LINCOLN (automated voice):
<i>The love of liberty. The love of liberty.</i>

12:33.836 --> 12:35.337
He'd be flinging his arms around.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.630
LINCOLN (automated voice):
<i>The love of liberty.</i>

12:36.714 --> 12:39.633
And he would literally smash his chair
into kindling.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.511
The list went on.
It was getting pretty desperate.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.555
NARRATOR: <i>The team desperately searched...</i>

12:44.638 --> 12:46.140
Why did that happen? My god.

12:46.223 --> 12:50.311
<i>...for what was triggering
Lincoln's short fuse.</i>

12:50.394 --> 12:52.354
So, they would go
and they'd get him another chair,

12:52.438 --> 12:55.316
and he'd work two, three days in a row,
and they'd bring in the press,

12:55.399 --> 12:58.110
and he'd stand up,
and he'd smash a chair into kindling.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.030
NARRATOR:
<i>Running out of options, and chairs,</i>

13:01.113 --> 13:05.659
<i>the Imagineers and, yes, the chairs,
were at a breaking point.</i>

13:05.743 --> 13:06.952
Somebody finally realized

13:07.036 --> 13:09.288
<i>they had another pavilion
called Tower of Light.</i>

13:09.955 --> 13:12.875
It had this gigantic,
mega candle beam light.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.627
BILL:
<i>Well, when they fired this thing up...</i>

13:14.710 --> 13:15.961
(rumbles)

13:16.045 --> 13:18.422
...the transient circuits
that would go through the ground

13:18.506 --> 13:20.174
<i>made Mr. Lincoln get feedback...</i>

13:20.257 --> 13:21.091
LINCOLN (automated voice):
<i>The love of liberty.</i>

13:21.175 --> 13:23.427
<i>...and he'd go crazy and smash his chair.</i>

13:23.511 --> 13:25.721
(clatters)

13:26.430 --> 13:30.392
NARRATOR: <i>It took nearly three weeks
to discover this electronic anomaly.</i>

13:30.476 --> 13:31.477
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Mr. Lincoln.</i>

13:31.560 --> 13:36.148
NARRATOR: <i>But on April 29th, 1964,
as Mr. Lincoln stood up,</i>

13:36.232 --> 13:39.485
<i>Walt Disney could finally take a bow.</i>

13:39.568 --> 13:43.364
The final result is so lifelike
that you might find it hard to believe.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.615
NARRATOR: <i>And people did.</i>

13:44.698 --> 13:49.286
When it finally opens, people believed
that it's actually a person on stage.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.038
My fellow countrymen...

13:51.121 --> 13:53.624
People sat in the audience
and looked at him and thought,

13:53.707 --> 13:56.126
"This has got to be a real person.
I see him breathing."

13:56.210 --> 13:57.753
Everyone was convinced it was an actor,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.130
'cause, I mean, this guy stood up.
He talked and everything.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.549
People thought he was real.

14:01.632 --> 14:06.929
But in using the same word,
we do not all mean the same thing.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.683
HARRIET: Time <i>said, "He is so good,
he even perspires."</i>

14:10.766 --> 14:13.227
And in all truth, he really did perspire

14:13.310 --> 14:17.356
because there was a migratory oil
in the skin that came to the surface,

14:17.439 --> 14:18.983
<i>and we'd have to pat that off.</i>

14:19.066 --> 14:22.111
I was astonished. I can still see him.

14:22.903 --> 14:27.283
I kept asking my mom, "Is it real?"
This guy was talking to me.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.201
We all declare for liberty.

14:29.285 --> 14:34.039
To have this historical figure
kind of share with you his mindset...

14:34.123 --> 14:37.418
Our reliance is in the love of liberty.

14:37.501 --> 14:40.421
CARMEN: <i>I remember being amazed.</i>

14:40.504 --> 14:42.548
<i>Like, I'm having a conversation</i>

14:42.631 --> 14:46.302
with a historical figure
that changed the world.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.804
We must live through all time.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.308
You learn a lot about
his guiding principles, his philosophy,

14:52.766 --> 14:56.562
<i>and what being the leader
of the free world, what it means.</i>

14:56.645 --> 15:03.402
NARRATOR: <i>It means respect, awe-inspiring,
lofty ambition, and light vandalism.</i>

15:03.485 --> 15:06.947
There was a sponsor
at the World's Fair, SKF Industries.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.657
And I don't know
why anybody would want it,

15:08.741 --> 15:10.701
but they gave out free samples
of ball bearings.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.495
BILL: <i>So, you got a kid
with a handful of ball bearings,</i>

15:13.579 --> 15:16.332
they gave out straws for the sodas. Hmm...

15:16.415 --> 15:18.083
So, people would go on to Mr. Lincoln

15:18.167 --> 15:20.836
and start shooting Mr. Lincoln
with the ball bearings.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.504
<i>He'd get one in his cheek, or whatever,</i>

15:22.588 --> 15:24.298
and it'd stay there
for the rest of the show.

15:24.381 --> 15:25.716
NARRATOR: <i>But the battle was won,</i>

15:25.799 --> 15:28.636
<i>because with the technology
now up and running,</i>

15:28.719 --> 15:32.973
<i>or at least standing,
the overwhelming response to Mr. Lincoln</i>

15:33.057 --> 15:35.309
<i>was proof that Walt was right about...</i>

15:35.392 --> 15:38.979
GARY: <i>The basic idea that in the discovery
of knowledge,</i>

15:39.438 --> 15:41.231
<i>there is great entertainment.</i>

15:41.315 --> 15:43.901
NARRATOR:
<i>And, for Walt Disney, great opportunity.</i>

15:43.984 --> 15:46.987
<i>So, he made a second Lincoln
for Disneyland.</i>

15:47.363 --> 15:51.033
<i>And, finally, he'd have
the perfect spot to put him.</i>

15:51.116 --> 15:54.203
WALT: Right here, off the town square.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.539
We're calling it Liberty Street.
We're busy putting it in.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.042
NARRATOR: <i>Except,
if you've been to Disneyland,</i>

16:00.125 --> 16:02.002
<i>you know that they put him here,</i>

16:02.086 --> 16:04.713
<i>in the Opera House on Main Street, USA,</i>

16:04.797 --> 16:08.884
<i>where</i> Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln
<i>remains to this day.</i>

16:08.968 --> 16:11.637
<i>So, uh, what did happen to Liberty Street?</i>

16:11.720 --> 16:12.763
We never built it.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.431
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, that's right.</i>

16:14.515 --> 16:19.228
<i>Because, well, after the massive success
of the World's Fair in New York,</i>

16:19.311 --> 16:22.398
<i>the winds of change
were blowing eastward for Walt.</i>

16:22.481 --> 16:24.984
GARY: <i>Walt was very interested
in expanding his audience</i>

16:25.067 --> 16:26.610
to the East Coast of the United States.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.820
NARRATOR: <i>And to do that...</i>

16:27.903 --> 16:29.738
He said,
"Well, I guess what we've got to do

16:29.822 --> 16:31.323
is to have another Disneyland."

16:31.407 --> 16:32.241
NARRATOR: <i>And thus...</i>

16:32.324 --> 16:34.410
Florida came to the forefront
very quickly.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.786
NARRATOR: <i>And why wouldn't it?</i>

16:35.869 --> 16:38.872
DICK: <i>It had a good tourist population.
Seventeen million tourists.</i>

16:38.956 --> 16:39.915
(all groan)

16:39.999 --> 16:41.333
It had good transportation.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.294
NARRATOR:
<i>And, most importantly for both brothers...</i>

16:44.378 --> 16:46.755
DICK: <i>A lot of land at a reasonable price.</i>

16:46.839 --> 16:49.800
To quote Walt, "To hold all the ideas
that we could come up with."

16:49.883 --> 16:52.386
NARRATOR: <i>All the ideas? Um, Roy?</i>

16:52.469 --> 16:56.473
Well, then I don't anticipate
any great difficulty in financing this.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.059
NARRATOR: <i>Ooh, this was gonna be easy.</i>

16:59.143 --> 17:03.188
<i>Walt had unlimited space
and finances to do what he wanted.</i>

17:03.272 --> 17:04.857
<i>Roy could take a bit of a break.</i>

17:04.940 --> 17:07.568
He was 73, and, well...
and he was trying to retire.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.487
NARRATOR: <i>And the future,
just like the weather in Florida,</i>

17:10.571 --> 17:11.947
<i>was looking bright.</i>

17:12.031 --> 17:13.407
<i>Just listen to the governor.</i>

17:13.490 --> 17:18.328
This is the most important day
in the progress

17:18.412 --> 17:20.789
and the future development of this state.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.833
NARRATOR: <i>And in just a few short years,</i>

17:22.916 --> 17:26.253
<i>the Florida Project
was planned to be up and running.</i>

17:26.336 --> 17:29.631
And I'd say it'd take
a year and a half to plan,

17:29.715 --> 17:33.177
and a year and a half to, uh,
to develop, three years.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.473
-MAN 4: Mr. Disney...
-Don't hold me to it.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.142
NARRATOR: <i>Sadly, for the entire world,</i>

17:40.225 --> 17:43.353
<i>just over a year
after this press conference,</i>

17:43.437 --> 17:46.065
<i>tragedy struck the Disney family.</i>

17:46.148 --> 17:49.526
<i>Roy's son was there
when his father got the news.</i>

17:49.610 --> 17:53.530
Walt was in the hospital.
Dad knew something was dreadfully wrong.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.034
And he then realized
he was gonna have to deal with it.

17:57.326 --> 18:02.289
ROY: <i>Walt had lymphogranuloma.
And Patti said, "That's cancer."</i>

18:05.125 --> 18:07.419
A lot of people don't realize it,

18:07.503 --> 18:11.423
but Walt Disney never saw
Walt Disney World break ground.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.218
When Walt died,

18:14.301 --> 18:17.262
I think a lot of people thought
that we might never get Walt Disney World.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.889
I mean, who's gonna take the mantle?

18:18.972 --> 18:23.060
Who's going to provide creative
and financial leadership going forward?

18:23.143 --> 18:25.979
NARRATOR: <i>Stepping up to complete
his little brother's vision,</i>

18:26.063 --> 18:28.315
<i>Roy knew exactly what he had to do.</i>

18:28.398 --> 18:31.902
REPORTER 1: <i>Roy Disney postponed
his retirement after Walt's death</i>

18:31.985 --> 18:34.154
<i>in order to carry on
with the company's plans</i>

18:34.238 --> 18:35.322
<i>for the Florida property.</i>

18:35.405 --> 18:39.201
NARRATOR: <i>Well, retiring or not,
Roy still ended up in Florida.</i>

18:39.284 --> 18:42.579
<i>With a new lease on life,
he spearheaded the Florida Project.</i>

18:42.663 --> 18:47.084
And so, although Roy had made the decision
to move forward with the project,

18:47.167 --> 18:50.879
<i>and Walt had given us
a beautiful blueprint in which to go from,</i>

18:50.963 --> 18:54.716
the Magic Kingdom in Florida
was certainly a daunting project.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.802
-NARRATOR: <i>But, like his little brother...</i>
-GARY: <i>Daunting.</i>

18:56.885 --> 18:58.220
-NARRATOR: <i>Or even...</i>
-MARTY: <i>Impossible.</i>

18:58.303 --> 19:00.389
<i>...meant nothing to Roy O. Disney.</i>

19:00.472 --> 19:02.224
It wasn't totally new to Roy.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.310
Roy had already had Walt
take him through the process

19:05.394 --> 19:07.896
<i>of creating the Disneyland Resort
in Anaheim.</i>

19:07.980 --> 19:10.232
NARRATOR:
<i>Roy's plans for the new park in Florida</i>

19:10.315 --> 19:14.236
<i>would follow the same layout
as Disneyland in California.</i>

19:14.319 --> 19:16.071
<i>We'd have the good old favorites.</i>

19:16.155 --> 19:17.114
ANNUONCER 2: <i>Frontierland.</i>

19:17.197 --> 19:18.740
-NARRATOR: <i>And, of course... </i>
-ANNOUNCER 3: <i>Tomorrowland.</i>

19:18.824 --> 19:20.325
-NARRATOR: <i>Don't forget...</i>
-ANNOUNCER 3: <i>Adventureland.</i>

19:20.409 --> 19:22.953
-NARRATOR: <i>And the one with the castle!</i>
-ANNOUNCER 3: <i>Fantasyland.</i>

19:23.036 --> 19:25.581
NARRATOR: <i>But for Walt's never-constructed
Liberty Street...</i>

19:25.664 --> 19:29.251
We're busy putting it in.
Right here, off the town square.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.462
NARRATOR: <i>Well, Roy thought he could do
a bit better than that.</i>

19:32.546 --> 19:36.508
<i>It would become a whole land
because Roy was dedicated</i>

19:36.592 --> 19:41.180
<i>to making sure the Magic Kingdom would be
exactly how Walt would have wanted it.</i>

19:41.263 --> 19:44.975
You can trace a lineage
back to earlier ideas, uh,

19:45.058 --> 19:46.727
that were considered for Disneyland,

19:46.810 --> 19:50.606
<i>and those ideas moved into
what we know of as Liberty Square.</i>

19:50.689 --> 19:53.400
The Imagineers combined
the background stories,

19:53.483 --> 19:58.113
<i>at least the design visual story,
of Liberty Square with Frontierland.</i>

19:58.197 --> 20:01.700
NARRATOR: <i>Frontierland, in itself,
a glorious historical wonderland.</i>

20:01.783 --> 20:05.329
<i>Frontierland is the inspirational America
of the past century.</i>

20:05.412 --> 20:09.917
And in doing so, they actually marked
the growth of America,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.127
architecturally and chronologically,

20:12.211 --> 20:15.631
<i>from the Atlantic Ocean
to the Pacific Ocean.</i>

20:15.714 --> 20:18.217
NARRATOR:
<i>To create a cohesive, chronological</i>

20:18.300 --> 20:21.178
<i>100-year depiction of American history,</i>

20:21.261 --> 20:26.058
<i>starting in 1775
and spanning sea to shining sea.</i>

20:26.141 --> 20:30.604
<i>For example, these red brick buildings
near the entrance to Liberty Square</i>

20:30.687 --> 20:32.981
<i>hearken back to Williamsburg, Virginia.</i>

20:33.065 --> 20:36.735
There was a Liberty Tree
that had the 13 lanterns in it.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.571
NARRATOR:
<i>There was, but not in the field nearby</i>

20:39.655 --> 20:43.200
<i>because they moved
that big noble tree to here,</i>

20:43.283 --> 20:45.369
<i>right to the center of Liberty Square</i>

20:45.452 --> 20:49.373
<i>where 13 lanterns shine bright
to this day,</i>

20:49.456 --> 20:54.503
<i>representing the original 13 colonies,
an important image to Walt,</i>

20:54.586 --> 20:57.965
<i>as seen in his beloved
Johnny Tremain movie</i>

20:58.048 --> 21:00.133
<i>that he made back in 1957.</i>

21:00.217 --> 21:04.054
Everyone in Boston who believes
their liberties are worth fighting for.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.014
You can keep your politics.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.225
I'll stick to my trade
and mind my own business.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.476
(gunshots)

21:09.559 --> 21:11.436
-NARRATOR: <i>He didn't.</i>
-Johnny...

21:11.520 --> 21:14.523
NARRATOR: <i>But if you thought
13 lanterns were impressive,</i>

21:14.606 --> 21:18.402
<i>over here would be Roy's greatest ode
to his little brother.</i>

21:19.027 --> 21:24.157
<i>Decades in the making,
at last, every president from history</i>

21:24.241 --> 21:27.077
<i>stood proudly
upon the Liberty Square stage</i>

21:27.160 --> 21:28.537
<i>to address the nation</i>

21:28.620 --> 21:30.330
-<i>from The Hall of Presidents.</i>
-WALT: Hall of Presidents.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.207
<i>But not just about any old thing.</i>

21:32.291 --> 21:37.129
They wanted to present to the people
a sense of the presidents as human beings.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.006
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, they definitely weren't that,</i>

21:39.089 --> 21:42.301
<i>but they would have
individual personalities.</i>

21:42.384 --> 21:44.553
Who had their own fears,
their own worries,

21:44.678 --> 21:47.055
their own strengths, their own weaknesses.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.017
And, for example, when we talked
about George Washington,

21:50.100 --> 21:52.936
to be able to uncover this letter
that he had written

21:53.020 --> 21:56.273
<i>shortly before he became president
where he expressed his fear</i>

21:56.356 --> 21:58.275
<i>that he'd be walking on untrodden ground,</i>

21:58.358 --> 22:00.944
and was he really strong enough
to be the first president?

22:01.028 --> 22:04.614
He knew he'd be setting a precedent
for every president to come thereafter.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.701
DORIS: <i>And the idea of George Washington
battling in the Revolution,</i>

22:07.784 --> 22:09.369
<i>having his own internal fears...</i>

22:09.453 --> 22:12.539
No event could have filled me
with greater anxieties

22:12.998 --> 22:17.544
than that notification
on the 14th day of April, 1789.

22:17.627 --> 22:20.756
DORIS: <i>It just set exactly the right tone,
I thought, for the exhibit.</i>

22:20.839 --> 22:23.675
NARRATOR: <i>Every president would have
their story, of course.</i>

22:23.759 --> 22:27.763
<i>But as for the long story
of Audio-Animatronics technology,</i>

22:27.846 --> 22:30.265
<i>well, by the early 1970s,</i>

22:30.349 --> 22:33.852
<i>the Imagineers had taken
that World's Fair know-how</i>

22:33.935 --> 22:37.022
<i>and made, shall we say, amendments,</i>

22:37.105 --> 22:42.778
<i>creating 36 life-sized,
realistic Audio-Animatronics presidents</i>

22:42.861 --> 22:46.990
<i>in plenty of time for opening day,
unlike the rest of the park.</i>

22:47.074 --> 22:51.161
We got it built. Even though we were
pouring concrete the night before.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.621
NARRATOR: <i>And so, when...</i>

22:52.704 --> 22:54.956
REPORTER 2:
<i>The grand opening of Walt Disney World.</i>

22:55.040 --> 22:58.418
<i>...happened on October 1st, 1971...</i>

22:59.836 --> 23:01.838
<i>nobody showed up.</i>

23:01.922 --> 23:04.174
<i>Just kidding! Glen Campbell showed up.</i>

23:04.257 --> 23:05.258
Ooh-whoo-hoo.

23:05.759 --> 23:06.843
Hi, I'm Glen Campbell.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.304
NARRATOR:
<i>Followed soon by many more people.</i>

23:09.388 --> 23:12.641
<i>Because it turned out
that Walt Disney World was very popular.</i>

23:13.183 --> 23:17.020
<i>And you know what was the most popular
out of a very popular place?</i>

23:17.104 --> 23:18.855
<i>Well, it wasn't Frontierland.</i>

23:18.980 --> 23:22.984
-Hello.
-<i>It wasn't Tomorrowland, or Adventureland,</i>

23:23.068 --> 23:26.071
<i>or even Fantasyland,
the one with the castle.</i>

23:26.154 --> 23:29.324
GARY: <i>Liberty Square was the
most popular land in the Magic Kingdom</i>

23:29.408 --> 23:32.119
for at least the first ten years
the park was open.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.871
NARRATOR:
<i>Even Julie Andrews had reason to prance.</i>

23:34.955 --> 23:39.126
<i>And, as heartthrob Glen Campbell
will now tell us, Liberty Square...</i>

23:39.209 --> 23:40.544
It's the heart of Disneyworld.

23:41.628 --> 23:44.089
And I'll tell you, it's a great place
just to think and feel.

23:44.172 --> 23:46.258
NARRATOR:
<i>It is a great place, Glen Campbell!</i>

23:46.341 --> 23:47.342
It's a great place.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.678
NARRATOR: <i>And if Liberty Square is...</i>

23:49.761 --> 23:51.179
GLEN: It's the heart of Disneyworld.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.889
-NARRATOR: <i>Then...</i>
-The Hall of Presidents.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.560
<i>...must be the artificial
Audio-Animatronics valve</i>

23:56.643 --> 23:58.854
<i>keeping that heart beating.</i>

23:59.312 --> 24:01.398
NARRATOR: <i>But it was more
the drumbeat of history</i>

24:01.481 --> 24:03.900
<i>that the American people
were banging on about.</i>

24:03.984 --> 24:06.111
There was a sense of patriotism
throughout the country.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.195
NARRATOR: <i>That's right.</i>

24:07.279 --> 24:09.698
Liberty Square was part
of the upcoming bicentennial.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.993
NARRATOR:
<i>And everyone had bicentennial fever.</i>

24:13.076 --> 24:16.663
<i>And the sweet smell of history
was wafting through the air.</i>

24:16.746 --> 24:18.957
REPORTER 3: <i>In 1975,
when you bought deodorant,</i>

24:19.040 --> 24:20.167
<i>it was deodorant.</i>

24:20.750 --> 24:22.836
<i>But this year,
it's bicentennial deodorant.</i>

24:22.919 --> 24:26.256
NARRATOR: <i>And in order for Disney
to celebrate this national anniversary,</i>

24:26.339 --> 24:29.426
<i>they held America on Parade each day,</i>

24:29.509 --> 24:33.305
<i>which was seen by an estimated
25 million people that year.</i>

24:33.388 --> 24:35.599
GARY: <i>Everyone was excited
about the 200th birthday.</i>

24:35.682 --> 24:38.643
And so Liberty Square
absolutely celebrated that

24:38.727 --> 24:42.272
and helped people connect
to that history of our country.

24:42.355 --> 24:45.108
NARRATOR:
<i>But the march of time stops for no man,</i>

24:45.192 --> 24:46.943
<i>Audio-Animatronics or otherwise.</i>

24:47.027 --> 24:50.572
<i>Because back in '71,
when The Hall of Presidents opened,</i>

24:50.655 --> 24:55.952
<i>the current president was Richard Nixon,
a man who'd been seen on TV a lot.</i>

24:56.036 --> 24:59.873
<i>So, people really knew what Nixon
and many of the other presidents...</i>

24:59.956 --> 25:02.083
-Ronnie Reagan.
-NARRATOR: <i>...actually looked like.</i>

25:02.167 --> 25:05.045
Because people see them on their screens.

25:05.128 --> 25:06.755
My wife and I were planning this trip

25:06.838 --> 25:08.715
and talking it over
with our two daughters.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.927
We asked them what they wanted to do most
when they came to California.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.764
And they said, "We want to see
our grandmother and go to Disneyland."

25:15.847 --> 25:20.101
There's a lot more freedoms
when it's a fictional character,

25:20.185 --> 25:22.687
<i>um, or an anthropomorphisized character.</i>

25:22.771 --> 25:27.275
-NARRATOR: <i>And unlike Lincoln, where...</i>
-...been able to secure this life mask.

25:27.359 --> 25:31.154
NARRATOR: <i>This was a challenge
the Imagineers hadn't really faced before.</i>

25:31.238 --> 25:34.199
You're trying to replicate
a very specific individual,

25:34.282 --> 25:37.953
a specific voice, a specific look.
Sometimes, you... it's hard to find that.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.163
NARRATOR: <i>Eh, every four to eight years,
they manage.</i>

25:40.247 --> 25:43.667
One of the things that makes
The Hall of Presidents story so exciting

25:43.750 --> 25:45.544
<i>is that it does change.</i>

25:45.627 --> 25:49.172
It was always the thought
of adding each past president.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.091
But then add future presidents.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.551
...Gorbachev, tear down this...

25:52.634 --> 25:57.264
There is a built-in new chapter
every four to eight years

25:57.347 --> 25:59.891
that keeps that story relevant.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.810
NARRATOR: <i>Relevant and, let's be honest...</i>

26:01.893 --> 26:06.398
It's a good way to add to a ride
without spending very much money.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.607
NARRATOR: <i>Nice one, Roy.</i>

26:07.691 --> 26:10.610
We the people are just getting started.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.153
NARRATOR: <i>As were the Imagineers.</i>

26:12.237 --> 26:16.825
<i>Because, as the election cycles puttered
along through modern American history...</i>

26:16.908 --> 26:20.078
-I, Lyndon Baines Johnson...
-...do solemnly...

26:20.161 --> 26:21.496
-...swear...
-...that I will faithfully...

26:21.580 --> 26:22.706
-...execute...
-...the Office of...

26:22.789 --> 26:24.499
-...President of...
-...the United States.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.834
-So help me...
-...God.

26:25.917 --> 26:30.088
Now, as technology advances,
we have the ability to come in

26:30.171 --> 26:32.215
<i>with smaller motors, smaller mechanisms,</i>

26:32.299 --> 26:34.926
to develop figures
that have even more personality.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.303
NARRATOR: <i>And the best way</i>

26:36.386 --> 26:39.764
<i>to really capture
those personalities is to meet them.</i>

26:39.848 --> 26:40.849
<i>Personally.</i>

26:41.349 --> 26:44.894
We would often take the opportunity
to go to the White House.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.772
NARRATOR:
<i>But, unlike a regular office field trip...</i>

26:47.856 --> 26:49.357
Well, getting clearance
to go to the White House

26:49.441 --> 26:51.359
takes a couple of months.

26:51.443 --> 26:55.030
NARRATOR: <i>Because the Imagineers
aren't looking for just a meet and greet.</i>

26:55.113 --> 26:59.200
They were very gracious
in allowing us to film them,

26:59.284 --> 27:02.621
recording the speeches
that they give for the attraction.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.206
Everybody ready? All right.

27:05.582 --> 27:09.711
My fellow Americans, when we look back
on the history of this country,

27:09.794 --> 27:12.547
we see a record
of almost unbelievable energy.

27:12.631 --> 27:18.428
And then, that way, we can capture
an authentic vocal performance from them,

27:18.511 --> 27:23.308
but also understand
their individual idiosyncrasies.

27:24.142 --> 27:28.563
How he smiles. How he nods his head.
The cadence of his speech.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.732
CARMEN:
<i>So, we're looking at all of those things.</i>

27:30.815 --> 27:33.068
And all of that information
is brought back

27:33.151 --> 27:36.696
and used to help interpret
the performance of the figure.

27:36.780 --> 27:40.867
And it was truly a life-changing moment
to be in the room,

27:40.950 --> 27:42.952
-to hear him talk.
-It is born every day...

27:43.036 --> 27:45.205
And to watch his articulation.

27:45.288 --> 27:46.956
...as timeless as our hopes.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.958
So many people are involved

27:49.042 --> 27:52.545
in making this one
Audio-Animatronics figure

27:52.629 --> 27:54.214
<i>as perfect as it can be.</i>

27:55.465 --> 27:59.469
When our guests are in the theater,
he's talking to them.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.388
And their eyes are so wide open

28:01.471 --> 28:03.515
as they're seeing him talk
as if he's real.

28:03.598 --> 28:06.476
The American Dream is as old
as our founding.

28:06.559 --> 28:10.814
I think it's a big deal for the Imagineers
who have the opportunity and the honor,

28:10.897 --> 28:15.568
and they really feel it's an honor
to help tell that president's story.

28:15.652 --> 28:18.113
One thing that's really important to us,
number one,

28:18.196 --> 28:22.784
we do our research, we do our homework,
and the attention to detail.

28:22.867 --> 28:28.957
And I think about what Imagineers do
and how they make fantasy reality.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.501
NARRATOR: <i>Although,
having all these fellas together</i>

28:31.584 --> 28:34.003
<i>in one room is far from reality</i>

28:34.087 --> 28:35.714
<i>and historically inaccurate.</i>

28:35.797 --> 28:40.051
<i>But as history comes to life every day
in The Hall of Presidents,</i>

28:40.135 --> 28:43.555
<i>you can't help but think
that Walt was right all along</i>

28:43.638 --> 28:45.765
<i>about history being entertaining.</i>

28:45.849 --> 28:48.893
Our reliance is in the love of liberty...

28:48.977 --> 28:51.896
NARRATOR: <i>And, it turns out,
it can be quite inspirational too.</i>

28:51.980 --> 28:54.566
This guy was real.
This guy was talking to me.

28:54.649 --> 28:57.819
NARRATOR: <i>Inspiration that led
to a long career for some.</i>

28:57.902 --> 29:02.365
And years later,
I wind up working on Mr. Lincoln.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.577
JIMMY: <i>I don't know how to explain
"Dreams come true."</i>

29:05.660 --> 29:08.663
But that's kind of like what it was like.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.541
NARRATOR: <i>Which, in turn,
has inspired generations.</i>

29:11.624 --> 29:13.209
<i>Or, at least, Jimmy's daughter.</i>

29:13.293 --> 29:16.880
Every night, our dinner table
conversations were a lot of...

29:16.963 --> 29:18.757
"You should see the thing I'm working on."

29:18.840 --> 29:21.551
"I finally figured out
how to get the mechanism to work."

29:21.634 --> 29:24.554
NARRATOR: <i>And what was once scintillating
dinner conversation</i>

29:24.637 --> 29:26.639
<i>is now Victoria's daily problem.</i>

29:26.723 --> 29:31.060
We look at examples
of historical choices daily.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.105
VICTORIA: <i>We're constantly discussing,
"Well, how was this done in the past?"</i>

29:34.189 --> 29:36.900
NARRATOR: <i>And it's how
this next generation of Imagineers</i>

29:36.983 --> 29:38.193
<i>do things in the future</i>

29:38.276 --> 29:41.488
<i>that's really worth talking about,
at the dinner table or otherwise.</i>

29:41.571 --> 29:48.578
I cannot imagine what revolutions
her generation will see. But...

29:50.121 --> 29:51.498
I'm ready to go see it.

29:53.374 --> 29:57.128
NARRATOR: <i>Oh. You wanna see it now?
Well, okay. It's this.</i>

29:58.755 --> 30:01.716
<i>Yep. That's Abraham Lincoln...</i>

30:01.800 --> 30:03.134
LINCOLN (animated voice): Love of liberty!

30:03.218 --> 30:04.719
<i>...swinging through the air!</i>

30:05.553 --> 30:06.471
NARRATOR: <i>Just kidding.</i>

30:06.554 --> 30:11.476
<i>It actually is the next evolution
of Audio-Animatronics called Stuntronics.</i>

30:11.810 --> 30:16.606
<i>But in any case, these old-timers
don't need to flip around to impress us.</i>

30:16.689 --> 30:20.693
<i>Ultimately, it's what they represent
that's truly powerful.</i>

30:20.777 --> 30:25.824
It is actually magical
to be able to go into an attraction

30:25.907 --> 30:28.827
and actually meet
all of the presidents at one time.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.287
NARRATOR: <i>And this magic
isn't a bad achievement</i>

30:31.371 --> 30:34.082
<i>for a bunch
of Audio-Animatronics old-timers</i>

30:34.165 --> 30:38.002
<i>filled with nothing more than servos
and articulated joints.</i>

30:38.086 --> 30:41.172
If we do our jobs,
they're not paying attention

30:41.256 --> 30:44.217
to the technology behind the storytelling.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.679
DICK: <i>That's why Audio-Animatronics
was developed.</i>

30:48.513 --> 30:50.682
Because, in a meeting one time,
I remember saying,

30:51.516 --> 30:54.143
"There's gotta be a better way
to tell the story of our country

30:54.227 --> 30:55.562
than just on a flat screen."

30:55.645 --> 30:57.939
NARRATOR: <i>Well, Walt Disney knew how.</i>

30:58.022 --> 31:00.024
DICK: <i>Walt Disney was a great American.</i>

31:00.608 --> 31:02.819
<i>He believed in this country strongly.</i>

31:05.405 --> 31:09.868
He also believed that
there had to be a way to do a better job

31:09.951 --> 31:12.412
of telling the history of our country.

31:12.495 --> 31:14.706
This is kind of the great American
that Walt was.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.917
NARRATOR: <i>Walt Disney's love
for his country</i>

31:18.001 --> 31:20.712
<i>has contributed in no small part</i>

31:20.795 --> 31:25.300
<i>to what people all around the world
see as the American Dream.</i>

31:27.093 --> 31:30.054
As you know,
Disneyland park is sort of a monument

31:30.138 --> 31:31.764
to the American way of life.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.392
NARRATOR: <i>And a country
that gave two brothers</i>

31:34.475 --> 31:36.102
<i>from the Midwest a chance</i>

31:36.185 --> 31:40.189
<i>to change history
and, subsequently, many people's lives.</i>

31:40.273 --> 31:42.901
So, The Hall of Presidents
has always been a very special place,

31:42.984 --> 31:45.194
just because I wasn't born
in this country.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.363
I immigrated here
when I was ten years old.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.533
DIEGO: <i>And I try to go there
as much as possible,</i>

31:50.617 --> 31:56.080
because it made a huge impact for me
during that very first visit back in 1983.

31:56.164 --> 32:00.043
Because I very much realized
that this was a great representation

32:00.126 --> 32:02.378
of what I had become a part of.

32:02.462 --> 32:06.674
Our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation,

32:07.383 --> 32:11.763
conceived in liberty
and dedicated to the proposition

32:11.846 --> 32:13.640
that all men are created equal.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.726
Those are the emotional connections
that we're able to make.

32:16.809 --> 32:17.852
And it's continued, right?

32:17.936 --> 32:20.772
From a little kid
to even working here for 30 years.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.775
It's still like the very first time
that I went there.

32:23.858 --> 32:26.527
The American Dream will endure.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.155
Just knowing that it's something
a lot bigger than me,

32:29.238 --> 32:30.573
but now I'm a part of that.

32:31.157 --> 32:34.327
I think, all in all,
what the experience will show people

32:34.410 --> 32:36.955
is the humanity
of the individual presidents

32:37.038 --> 32:41.000
<i>and their ability to connect emotionally
to the American people.</i>

32:41.084 --> 32:43.127
NARRATOR: <i>It's a connection
that few understood</i>

32:43.211 --> 32:44.671
<i>better than Walt Disney</i>

32:44.754 --> 32:47.924
<i>and the brother
who brought Walt's vision to life.</i>

32:48.007 --> 32:50.593
<i>Literally. Using servos.</i>

32:50.677 --> 32:52.637
Roy was absolutely dedicated

32:52.720 --> 32:56.349
to making sure that
his brother's big vision came to be.

32:56.432 --> 32:59.018
And then, just months after
Walt Disney World opened,

32:59.102 --> 33:00.061
he passed away.

33:01.354 --> 33:05.900
NARRATOR:
<i>Roy O. Disney died on December 20th, 1971,</i>

33:06.651 --> 33:10.697
<i>at the same hospital where Walt had died
in Burbank, California,</i>

33:10.780 --> 33:12.448
<i>five years earlier.</i>

33:12.949 --> 33:16.285
We kidded him for about the last two years
of that Florida Project.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.913
You know, getting it...
leading up to the opening.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.249
And we used to say, "Dad, Grandpa,

33:21.332 --> 33:24.043
you're just gonna curl up your toes
when this is over, aren't you?"

33:24.752 --> 33:26.796
And, unfortunately, sure enough, he did.

33:26.879 --> 33:31.676
NARRATOR: <i>Roy gave everything he had
to keep his brother's vision alive.</i>

33:31.759 --> 33:32.844
ALEX: <i>And even changed the name.</i>

33:32.927 --> 33:37.557
It was not going to be Walt Disney World
when Walt was still alive.

33:37.640 --> 33:41.394
Roy changed that and added the name Walt
in honor of his brother.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.563
WAYNE: <i>I can remember, to this day,</i>

33:43.646 --> 33:47.900
Roy on the stage
when he dedicated Walt Disney World.

33:47.984 --> 33:53.239
Walt Disney World is a tribute
to the philosophy

33:53.322 --> 33:56.701
<i>and the life of Walter Elias Disney.</i>

33:57.076 --> 33:59.537
NARRATOR: <i>But it's also a tribute to Roy,</i>

33:59.620 --> 34:04.667
<i>the big brother who put off his plans
to retire for his little brother.</i>

34:04.751 --> 34:05.710
WALT: <i>My big brother...</i>

34:07.211 --> 34:09.088
And he's the one that,
when I was a little fella,

34:09.172 --> 34:12.300
I used to go to
with some of my wild ideas,

34:12.383 --> 34:17.346
and he'd either straighten me up,
put me up the right path or something,

34:17.430 --> 34:19.682
or if he didn't agree with me,

34:19.766 --> 34:22.643
<i>I'd work on it for years
until I got him to agree with me.</i>

34:22.727 --> 34:27.607
NARRATOR: <i>And that's the story of life,
love, liberty, Liberty Square,</i>

34:27.690 --> 34:30.026
<i>and The Hall of Presidents.</i>

34:30.943 --> 34:31.944
(dings)

34:32.028 --> 34:33.446
-Thank you all.
-Thank you.

34:33.529 --> 34:34.906
-That was nice.
-Thank you.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.866
NARRATOR: <i>Hmm. He really is realistic.</i>

34:37.742 --> 34:39.744
(light music)
