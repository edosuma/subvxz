-You all right?
-Yeah.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.791
ANTHONY: Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.083
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:48.791 --> 20:50.666
now, as you know
we're here to celebrate

20:50.750 --> 20:53.583
a very special day
in this young man's life.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.500
Although I'm not sure
he's actually let on how old he is.

20:56.583 --> 21:00.166
But put it this way, Pam told me
the candles cost more than the cake!

21:00.250 --> 21:01.875
So you can read
into that what you will.

21:01.958 --> 21:03.833
(LAUGHTER)

21:04.250 --> 21:06.500
No, but what I can tell you is that,

21:06.750 --> 21:08.458
Cliff started with nothing

21:08.791 --> 21:12.875
and he built up a property empire
that, well, it's the envy of us all.

21:13.625 --> 21:17.041
But he's never forgotten those people
less fortunate than himself.

21:17.750 --> 21:22.000
He's always put his wealth
and good nature to good use.

21:22.541 --> 21:24.541
Cliff, we're lucky
to have you as a friend.

21:24.625 --> 21:25.625
ALL: Here, here!

21:25.708 --> 21:27.125
Happy birthday, Cliff!

21:27.958 --> 21:29.541
(GRUNTING)

21:32.916 --> 21:34.583
ALBERT: Keep your guard up, Liam!

21:35.666 --> 21:37.833
Move inside, move inside. That's it.

21:38.583 --> 21:40.458
Keep the footwork simple.

21:41.583 --> 21:43.833
You want to dance?
Take up the bloody Tango!

21:45.791 --> 21:50.250

you're going to run out of steam!

21:53.791 --> 21:55.125
How are you, Mr Cullen?

21:58.625 --> 22:00.041
ALBERT: That's it, that's it.

22:01.416 --> 22:03.291
-Who's that?
-Liam. McDonagh's boy.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.375
I thought so.

22:04.458 --> 22:05.875
I knew him as a kid.

22:08.875 --> 22:10.458
How long has he been out, then?

22:10.708 --> 22:13.833
ALBERT: Two weeks. One of the best
amateurs I've had through here.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.875
(GRUNTING)

22:15.958 --> 22:17.833
All right, boys. All right. That's it.

22:18.041 --> 22:19.583
Lovely. Very nice.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.583
Welcome back, man.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.291
Stick the kettle on, mate, would you?

22:24.375 --> 22:25.750
Oh, yeah.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.041
Hello, Liam.

22:38.916 --> 22:40.250
Mr Cullen.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.791
Very glad to see you out, son.

22:44.375 --> 22:46.000
You looked very good up there.

22:46.375 --> 22:47.750
You still looking to fight?

22:49.166 --> 22:50.291
No.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.541
Besides, I ain't got a licence.

22:52.791 --> 22:54.250
You don't need one, son.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.333
Well, I've got this white collar
charity do coming up.

23:00.833 --> 23:02.208
If you're interested.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.458
Yeah, thanks, but I'm busy.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.208
It's totally kosher.

23:10.208 --> 23:13.083
It's a big fundraising event
for the police.

23:13.666 --> 23:15.750
They want a bit of entertainment.

23:16.708 --> 23:18.458
Be a very good night's work for you.

23:21.208 --> 23:22.833
Forgive me, son, but...

23:22.916 --> 23:25.125
I should imagine
things are a bit tight for you

23:25.208 --> 23:26.583
at the moment, aren't they?

23:26.833 --> 23:28.000
Look,

23:29.291 --> 23:31.541
here's a bit of folding money for you.

23:32.333 --> 23:33.583
To see you through.

23:34.916 --> 23:36.875
I ain't a charity, Mr Cullen.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.000
Course not.

23:40.583 --> 23:42.375
Just look at it as an advance.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.625
All I ask
is that you put on a good show.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.583
Dad!

23:55.000 --> 23:56.375
Oh!

23:56.958 --> 23:58.250
Hiyah, mate!

24:04.958 --> 24:06.708
I really appreciate this, Grace.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.541
Well, look after him.
He's all I've got.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.166
All right. You ready?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.500

24:20.208 --> 24:21.625
I took a fight.

24:23.416 --> 24:25.083
Aren't you a bit past all that?

24:28.916 --> 24:30.166
Thank you.

24:31.541 --> 24:33.541
All right.
I'll have him back before 6:00.

24:33.666 --> 24:35.166
All right.

24:35.958 --> 24:37.083
Wait.

24:38.291 --> 24:39.708
All right, have a nice time.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.416
-See you.
-Dad?

24:42.500 --> 24:45.291
-Yeah?
-Why did you steal all that money?

24:49.375 --> 24:53.250
Because I wanted things
that I thought were important.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.833
And when I realised they weren't,

24:55.916 --> 24:57.208
it was too late.

25:07.875 --> 25:09.041

What did you say? (LAUGHS)

25:27.750 --> 25:28.916

25:30.166 --> 25:31.500
Put it on.

25:39.125 --> 25:40.375

John Somers,

30:21.541 --> 30:27.041
nicknamed Carrots, was refused entry
to 18 Stepney Causeway,

30:27.625 --> 30:29.166
because the orphanage was full.

30:32.125 --> 30:35.166
Now, tragically, two days later,

30:35.333 --> 30:39.250
he was found dead,
from malnutrition and exposure.

And the following day,

30:42.916 --> 30:45.791
Dr Thomas Barnardo,

30:45.916 --> 30:48.083

What they found was endemic.

36:10.541 --> 36:11.958
Where's your proof?

36:12.750 --> 36:15.791
It was shredded, along with 10 years
worth of incriminating evidence.

36:15.875 --> 36:18.791
The question is, detective,
what are you going to do about it?

36:46.833 --> 36:48.083
All right.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.750
He's out.

36:53.083 --> 36:54.333
Here.

36:56.458 --> 36:57.958
It's my purse from tonight.

36:58.458 --> 36:59.625
I want you to have it.

37:01.916 --> 37:03.125
Thank you.

37:05.916 --> 37:08.000
Let me put some ice
and antiseptic on that.

37:10.041 --> 37:12.791
Well, it's kicking out time, isn't it?
I'll fit right in.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.250
I have missed you.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.125
I miss us.

Cheers, man.

38:34.416 --> 38:35.875
Hello. Good evening.

38:36.666 --> 38:39.125
Good morning, yeah.
This is Detective Neil Beckett.

38:39.458 --> 38:42.000
I'd like to request an interview
with a remand inmate.

38:42.083 --> 38:44.458
Yes. Besmir Rugova.

38:51.250 --> 38:52.625
Well, thank you.

39:08.750 --> 39:11.125
I like a bit of Verdi, not this.

39:15.791 --> 39:20.125
Earlier this evening, Rugova was found
swinging from his cell window.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.541
Well...

39:22.833 --> 39:25.041
the man's gone up in my estimation.

39:25.125 --> 39:27.166
I didn't think he had
the balls to do something like that.

(SCOFFS)

39:30.125 --> 39:32.625
Anthony, what's going on with Ahmed?

39:33.583 --> 39:36.625
He feels he ought to
keep his distance for a while.

39:38.750 --> 39:41.541
I couldn't care less
if he's holed up in Timbuktu,

39:41.625 --> 39:44.541
as long as he makes sure
my planning application goes through.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.416
He wants to take a rain check, Cliff.

39:50.750 --> 39:52.416
What is he? A fucking weatherman?

39:55.625 --> 39:57.625
The more visible you become,

39:58.125 --> 39:59.666
the closer the scrutiny.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.333
Now, that's got him spooked.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.750
Your greatest asset
was always your anonymity.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.708
that he's the one
who's becoming too visible.

40:23.125 --> 40:28.166
And either...
he pushes my application through,

40:28.333 --> 40:30.083
or this

41:49.666 --> 41:51.166
Liam, this is going too fast.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.791
It's going to confuse him.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.416
Yeah, right. Sorry.

he was going to pull some strings,

-He's got a past.
-Well, who doesn't round here?

All he's doing
is bumping you up the list.

That way the Council can't ship you
off to the arse end of nowhere.

And he doesn't
have to make new friends.

42:29.125 --> 42:30.958
Just promise me you'll think about it

42:31.041 --> 42:32.291

you have here, Mr Cullen.

So, obviously your legacy
is very important to you, Mr Cullen.

42:55.916 --> 42:58.041
Well, you show me a man over 60

42:58.125 --> 43:00.416
who isn't worried about
what he's going to leave behind

I mean, it wouldn't be right

my good fortune, would it?

I mean, it's my privilege
to be able to give something back.

43:27.125 --> 43:29.541
I guess it must have come
as a real shock, then,

43:30.000 --> 43:31.666
to discover that
one of your former employees

43:31.833 --> 43:33.708
had been found
murdered and dismembered

43:33.791 --> 43:35.375
under the Queen Elizabeth Bridge.

43:36.875 --> 43:38.291
I don't know
what you're talking about.

43:38.375 --> 43:39.625
Warren Byford?

43:40.291 --> 43:43.958
He worked for Urban City Maintenance
since five years ago.

43:44.375 --> 43:45.791
According to Companies House,

43:45.875 --> 43:48.541
that's a company you're still
a majority shareholder of.

43:48.791 --> 43:50.666
Now, according to my source,
it's funny,

43:50.750 --> 43:52.500
Urban City Maintenance has held

43:52.625 --> 43:56.375
a one-million-pound-a-year contract
with the police

43:56.458 --> 43:59.291
to service police stations throughout
the capital for the last 15 years.

43:59.375 --> 44:01.833
Come on. It's time for you to go.

44:04.416 --> 44:07.083
Did you know that Warren Byford

44:07.166 --> 44:10.291
had previously
served several custodial sentences

44:10.500 --> 44:14.083
for commercial burglary
before you gave him the opportunity

44:14.208 --> 44:16.916
to work inside police stations
throughout the capital?

44:18.166 --> 44:19.500
Come on, on your way, son.

44:21.541 --> 44:23.958
Well, could you at least, Mr Cullen...

44:24.250 --> 44:25.250
could you at least give me a comment

44:25.333 --> 44:27.291
on your relationship
with the Mayor of Newham?

44:27.375 --> 44:29.500
Because, you know, he's been awarding
some lucrative building contracts

44:29.583 --> 44:32.125
to companies that you've had
a direct financial interest in

44:32.250 --> 44:33.583
for the last 25 years.

44:33.666 --> 44:34.875

44:42.541 --> 44:43.916

44:44.875 --> 44:48.041
and I'll put you
and your family in the ground

and no one will ever find you.

of writing a story,

45:33.958 --> 45:35.125
you send in the lawyers.

45:35.458 --> 45:38.125
Right, right.
Well, with all due respect, Anthony,

45:38.666 --> 45:40.541
we need to silence the fucker.

45:41.583 --> 45:44.166
Cliff, this isn't Malta.
The press are off-limits.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.750
Now, listen to me
very carefully, Anthony.

45:49.458 --> 45:51.458
I stayed afloat for 40 years.

45:53.333 --> 45:55.500
And that takes some doing
in this business.

45:58.041 --> 45:59.958
But if this ship goes down,

46:00.666 --> 46:04.416
there ain't going to be any life rafts
floating about, do you understand?

46:05.208 --> 46:06.875
Everyone goes under,

46:09.000 --> 46:10.416
including you.

investigating senior policemen.

serving and retired officers

46:45.250 --> 46:47.916
up to the rank of Commander,
that were all involved.

to be looking over my shoulder

46:52.833 --> 46:54.416
-every day of the week.
-Gemma!

46:54.500 --> 46:56.458
Gemma, they organised robberies.

46:56.750 --> 46:59.625
They stole and re-sold drugs.
They planted and destroyed evidence.

46:59.708 --> 47:02.541
Anything that you can think of,
they had their fingers in.

47:03.625 --> 47:05.333
Where were they operating out of?

47:05.625 --> 47:07.166
Specialist units, mainly.

Anyone with access to big league
villains that needed a helping hand.

47:18.458 --> 47:19.791
How many got arrested?

(SIGHS) None.

47:25.666 --> 47:27.375
Before ghost squad
could present their evidence

47:27.458 --> 47:29.166
to the CPS, it was all shredded.

47:29.833 --> 47:32.500
Fifteen years of proof
and witness statements,

47:32.583 --> 47:34.083
and it all ended up in the bin.

49:46.333 --> 49:48.708
paying their respects
at Warren Byford's wake.

49:48.958 --> 49:52.166
I put Liam McDonagh away
for a 14-year stretch,

49:52.250 --> 49:54.125
for a cash-in-transit robbery.

49:54.583 --> 49:55.916
What the hell
has he got to do with this?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.875
It's not Liam who's of interest, sir.
It's his brother.

50:00.041 --> 50:02.208
But you've heard of
Isaac Gale, though, right?

50:03.250 --> 50:05.708
This is Sean
visiting Gale four hours later.

50:06.708 --> 50:07.916
Where are you going with this, Neil?

50:08.000 --> 50:10.166
Byford was laundering money
for Isaac Gale, right?

50:10.250 --> 50:12.833
And when he became a wanted man,
they killed him.

50:13.250 --> 50:16.000
We already have a man in custody
who is bang to rights.

50:16.208 --> 50:18.458

in physical contact with Rugova.

don't you think?

of that fucking gun, understood?

as he could,
