WEBVTT

00:14.000 --> 00:17.250
Leni! We have to get out of here
and get Dad out!

00:17.333 --> 00:20.000
Dad's gone. It's just us.

00:20.916 --> 00:23.333
Like always. The two of us forever.

00:23.416 --> 00:25.333
Now we made a promise, didn't we?

00:25.416 --> 00:29.083
Now I'm just asking you
to keep that promise.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.166
Leni!

00:34.250 --> 00:35.083
Gina!

00:50.958 --> 00:52.000
Gina.

01:51.083 --> 01:53.083
-Shit.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.500
Come on.

01:58.083 --> 01:59.458
-Come on!

02:44.000 --> 02:46.208
-Ouch. Shit.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.708
What was that?

02:49.875 --> 02:50.708
I don't know.

02:53.958 --> 02:55.208
There's somebody in here.

02:57.333 --> 02:58.375
There's no one here.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.041
-You want me to check?
-Please.

04:03.208 --> 04:04.041
Gina!

04:04.875 --> 04:06.625
Gina, stop! Please!

04:08.958 --> 04:10.666
Leni! Are you okay?

04:11.750 --> 04:14.291
Where's Victor? What happened?

04:15.791 --> 04:17.583
What happened, Leni? Leni!

04:24.125 --> 04:25.583
Hey, it's Jack Beck.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.416
We got a fire out at our place.
105 River Bend Road.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.375
Please hurry.

04:52.416 --> 04:54.041
Gina, come on!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.875
God!

04:59.958 --> 05:01.000
Oh, fuck.

05:03.791 --> 05:05.250
-Gina!

05:09.541 --> 05:12.000
Come on, Gina! It's over!

05:26.250 --> 05:28.750
Jack, any sign of Victor?

05:29.833 --> 05:34.125
No. I tried to get in, but the place
was engulfed when I got to it.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.041
The boys have got this.
It won't spread.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.833
They'll figure out how it started.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.458
Did you say
they both took off on horseback?

05:43.583 --> 05:45.291
-Yeah.
-Which way did they go?

05:46.291 --> 05:47.625
Into the woods.

05:51.708 --> 05:54.000
Well, maybe we just
let them go this time.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.250
Yeah, I don't know.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.250
Those two, they're…

05:59.375 --> 06:01.500
They're in a whole mess of trouble.

06:02.083 --> 06:05.708
Yes, they are, my friend.
Yes, they are.

06:06.416 --> 06:09.250
-Keep an eye out for poison ivy!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.875
You know how allergic we are!

06:13.916 --> 06:18.416
Mattie's the same way. I…
I use baking soda, just like Mama.

06:20.083 --> 06:21.208
Remember that?

06:21.708 --> 06:24.750
Cakes up, falls off,
leaves a trail wherever she goes.

06:25.958 --> 06:29.041
Hey, look! I got a plan
and it's gonna work, Gina.

06:29.125 --> 06:33.375
It's gonna work. It's gonna allow us
to go back to the way life used to be.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.833
I mean, not with Jack
or anything like that.

06:35.916 --> 06:37.291
I guess we fucked that up.

06:38.916 --> 06:41.125
Why don't we start something new, okay?

06:41.208 --> 06:43.333
You know, we can both leave Mount Echo.

06:43.416 --> 06:47.708
That's a great idea.
You can become whatever you want.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.916
All right? How does that sound?

06:59.083 --> 07:00.875
Good. Now together.

07:42.916 --> 07:45.958
Come on, Gina! It's over!

07:53.375 --> 07:54.416
Gina!

07:58.666 --> 07:59.875
Come on, Gina!

08:04.541 --> 08:05.375
Gina.

08:08.166 --> 08:09.750
Come out of the water!

08:11.416 --> 08:13.416
There's nowhere else to go.

08:15.000 --> 08:15.916
Come home!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.291
I have no home.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.208
I'm your home.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.125
You've consumed me.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.791
And now, you've lost me.

08:26.833 --> 08:27.875
Forever.

09:07.708 --> 09:08.625
Leni.

09:09.500 --> 09:14.041
I only tried to protect you
from that first night.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.208
What night?

09:16.958 --> 09:18.250
What night, Leni?

11:02.250 --> 11:03.291
Gina!

11:06.458 --> 11:07.333
Leni!

11:28.125 --> 11:33.041
He killed Mom, Gina, and I never told you.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.958
No, Leni. That's not what happened.

11:36.541 --> 11:37.583
I saw it.

11:38.875 --> 11:39.875
They…

11:40.875 --> 11:45.500
You remember there were
apple blossoms everywhere, right?

11:45.583 --> 11:48.625
They planned it. Together.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.208
It's what she wanted!

11:52.291 --> 11:53.583
I saw it!

11:55.250 --> 11:57.750
No, listen to me.

12:00.291 --> 12:04.125
<i>You remember, she was so sick that spring</i>
<i>and she loved the apple blossoms.</i>

12:10.500 --> 12:12.625
-Oh, I got you.

12:15.625 --> 12:16.583
Come here.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.333
You're wrong.

12:26.416 --> 12:27.333
No.

12:27.875 --> 12:31.375
You've got it all wrong.
It's what she wanted.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.666
That's not what it was.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.666
That's not what I saw.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.625
It's what she wanted.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.458
Were there apple blossoms there?

12:42.541 --> 12:43.666
It's proof.

12:44.416 --> 12:48.375
It's proof, Leni. They planned it.

12:48.958 --> 12:52.000
That's why Dad thought
it was so important for me to know.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.500
He said he didn't want us to see

12:55.583 --> 12:58.500
because there was no way
for us to understand it.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.166
Leni, we were kids!

13:01.833 --> 13:02.833
No.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.875
He wanted to protect us
the way that you protected me,

13:07.916 --> 13:09.583
but it all got fucked up!

13:12.250 --> 13:13.916
Because that secret…

13:14.708 --> 13:18.375
That one thing that
you believed that wasn't true…

13:22.833 --> 13:24.291
It started everything.

13:25.416 --> 13:27.541
Because I was bad Gina.

13:27.625 --> 13:30.000
Dad thought it was me who saw.

13:30.083 --> 13:30.916
No.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.791
No, no, no.

13:34.708 --> 13:37.708
You don't understand.
I had to take care of us.

13:38.291 --> 13:39.875
I always take care of us.

13:42.416 --> 13:44.250
I'm trying to help you.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.875
I promise I'll never
keep a secret from you again.

13:47.958 --> 13:50.500
Just come back to me, all right?

13:51.166 --> 13:52.208
All right? So we…

13:53.000 --> 13:55.666
So we can be together, okay?

14:00.125 --> 14:01.833
Like always.

14:03.541 --> 14:04.416
No.

14:08.833 --> 14:11.333
No!

14:30.375 --> 14:32.416
My granddaddy had a saying,

14:33.375 --> 14:36.958
"Trouble follows some people
like an old yellow dog."

14:38.000 --> 14:40.833
And I'd have to say that about this bunch.

14:40.916 --> 14:42.083
You got that right.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.375
I'll be right back.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.833
-Jack? Uh…
-Yeah?

15:12.916 --> 15:14.750
You ever seen this before?

15:19.000 --> 15:23.291
Yeah. Yeah, they wore those
when they were kids. Why?

15:24.041 --> 15:25.000
Never mind.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.416
Hey, Paula. Feels like it's time
to get our search party back together.

15:44.166 --> 15:47.416
So when you looked down there,
she was gone?

15:47.500 --> 15:49.083
You didn't see her swimming or…

15:49.875 --> 15:51.958
No. Nothing.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.000
Uh-huh.

15:55.833 --> 15:57.458
-You don't believe me.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.166
Well, it seems convenient.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.333
What do you mean?

16:05.250 --> 16:08.916
Leni, I can't confirm
anything you just told me.

16:09.583 --> 16:12.083
That Gina confessed to killing Dylan.

16:13.083 --> 16:17.416
That your daddy died of a heart condition
before the fire started.

16:19.166 --> 16:23.541
See, it's all so complicated now
that you've admitted to switching.

16:23.625 --> 16:26.083
Was she the troubled one or you?

16:28.708 --> 16:29.875
You think she's dead?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.875
The only thing I think
is that she wanted to get away.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.583
And now she has.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.625
I'll see you and your lawyer
in the morning.

17:07.916 --> 17:09.875
-What happened tonight?

17:09.958 --> 17:12.166
-Didn't the sheriff find you?
-She did.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.500
They think it was a suicide.
I don't believe that.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.166
I tried to stop her.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.875
-She went over the falls.
-Yes.

17:17.958 --> 17:20.083
Why? What did you do?

17:20.166 --> 17:22.250
Well, I didn't push her, Jesus!

17:23.000 --> 17:26.958
That's not what I meant.
I just want to know what happened.

17:31.958 --> 17:33.750
I followed her into the forest.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.458
I told her how much I loved her.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.208
It didn't matter.

17:44.583 --> 17:50.291
There was something
so broken inside of her that

17:51.958 --> 17:53.416
no amount of love could heal.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.875
I know there's a deep hurt in both of you.

18:00.583 --> 18:01.416
And you…

18:02.791 --> 18:05.250
You knew after all these years.

18:06.416 --> 18:07.958
Why didn't you say anything?

18:09.958 --> 18:11.875
I thought I was doing the right thing.

18:12.458 --> 18:16.208
Being present, accepting, loving you.

18:16.291 --> 18:19.375
Watching, judging, playing along.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.208
Was it play for you, Leni?

18:21.291 --> 18:23.833
Because it wasn't for me. It was a life.

18:23.916 --> 18:24.791
Two lives.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.166
Yes.

18:29.750 --> 18:30.625
And now?

18:41.958 --> 18:43.166
Do you think she's dead?

18:44.583 --> 18:45.541
I don't know.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.541
I thought I'd know.

18:49.833 --> 18:50.833
Wouldn't I know?

18:55.541 --> 19:00.125
You know, there's two images that I…
I can't get rid of.

19:02.833 --> 19:06.791
The first one is… her body.

19:08.833 --> 19:12.041
On the shore of the river
somewhere in the darkness now.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.916
Waiting. Which, uh…

19:20.000 --> 19:24.125
The second one
is she's on a bus.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.666
Or a plane or something. And…

19:33.458 --> 19:34.416
She's happy.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.250
But in both cases, I can't talk to her.

19:42.083 --> 19:44.791
I can't touch her.
I can't hear the sound of her voice.

19:45.750 --> 19:52.416
She's just gone. Without a goodbye
or any kind of… a resolution.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.125
It's… unfinished.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.375
You are her.

20:13.541 --> 20:14.625
And not her.

20:20.958 --> 20:21.791
Fuck.

20:21.875 --> 20:25.666
I am so sorry, Charlie.

20:43.750 --> 20:44.958
I never judged.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.041
I watched.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.791
I went along.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.333
I never judged.

20:55.958 --> 20:57.541
And I loved both of you.

20:59.583 --> 21:00.875
I love you too.

21:33.916 --> 21:35.583
-Paula!
-Yeah?

21:37.208 --> 21:41.250
Can you pull all those boxes
relating to the church fire again?

21:42.500 --> 21:45.416
-Uh, all of them?
-Uh-huh.

21:47.666 --> 21:49.583
I'll fire up some popcorn
in the microwave.

21:49.666 --> 21:51.791
That'll make it better, won't it?

21:52.625 --> 21:55.000
Um… But do you mind if I ask why?

21:56.375 --> 22:00.583
Slowly, slowly, slowly,
something's starting to creep up on me.

22:02.416 --> 22:05.875
I need to stop thinking
of these sisters as two people

22:05.958 --> 22:07.666
and start thinking of them as one.

22:10.208 --> 22:13.333
So anything that Gina did,
Leni might be guilty of too.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.166
How do you prove that?

22:20.541 --> 22:26.083
Leni claims that she never went
inside the church that night.

22:27.708 --> 22:31.666
So I need a piece of physical evidence
that proves that she did go inside

22:31.750 --> 22:33.791
and she started that fire.

22:39.375 --> 22:40.666
The good sister.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.541
I'm checking right now.

23:18.416 --> 23:20.333
Have a good night, Deputy.

23:20.916 --> 23:22.083
Good night.

23:44.791 --> 23:48.250
I'm pretty sure Floss is
going to file murder one against you

23:48.333 --> 23:49.416
for the Dylan thing.

23:49.500 --> 23:50.625
That was Gina.

23:51.958 --> 23:56.000
Well, that may give us reasonable doubt,
if we can confuse the jury, but…

23:56.083 --> 23:57.000
What?

23:59.333 --> 24:01.083
I've known Floss a long time.

24:01.166 --> 24:02.208
We both have.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.333
She doesn't go into a fight
unless she thinks she can win it.

24:06.416 --> 24:10.125
So I have to ask you,
is there something else?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.833
No.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.625
I mean, the switching…

24:17.666 --> 24:20.791
That's going to make everybody
think that we're evil, pulling a con,

24:20.875 --> 24:22.208
but that wasn't the point.

24:23.166 --> 24:25.291
It didn't benefit us in any criminal way.

24:25.375 --> 24:31.166
But there is a moral component to it
that doesn't reflect well, let's just say.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.000
Yeah.

24:34.208 --> 24:37.500
Well, if they were
putting people in jail for moral failure,

24:37.583 --> 24:40.750
we wouldn't have anybody to sit on a jury.
So I wouldn't worry about it.

24:40.833 --> 24:43.708
We'll just wait and see what
she has to say and take it from there.

24:44.708 --> 24:47.250
Now my guess is that
on the preliminary hearing,

24:47.333 --> 24:50.333
they're going to ask you to turn in
your passport, check in daily.

24:50.416 --> 24:53.166
That sort of thing. So, just be prepared.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.458
One last thing. Jack and Mattie.

24:58.833 --> 25:01.791
I'm a criminal lawyer, Leni.

25:02.666 --> 25:05.833
I can give you a referral
to a good divorce attorney.

25:05.916 --> 25:07.625
But do you think he'll get Mattie?

25:09.958 --> 25:11.333
I wouldn't hazard a guess.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.416
And my condolences on your daddy.

25:17.416 --> 25:20.041
Victor was a good man.
It was a terrible tragedy.

25:21.416 --> 25:22.250
Yeah.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.083
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:33.875 --> 25:37.375
What is she doing here?
I thought she was arrested!

25:39.250 --> 25:41.458
-Did you hear?
-She burnt down his house.

25:42.791 --> 25:46.750
-She's gonna hear you!
-I don't care if she hears.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.625
Hey, thanks for coming right over.

25:57.708 --> 26:00.041
Yeah, well, you said it was important.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.125
Look, I shouldn't be here, but…

26:03.375 --> 26:07.791
I feel sort of connected to you.

26:07.875 --> 26:10.583
I guess. I don't know why, but you…

26:10.666 --> 26:14.541
Well, Gina, really. Um…

26:15.750 --> 26:17.125
But your whole family…

26:18.750 --> 26:22.125
You were really the only ones
who were nice to me when I moved here.

26:24.333 --> 26:29.208
And, uh, not Southern fake friendly.
But real.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.833
Look, I don't think
you and your sister are bad.

26:33.916 --> 26:35.791
Here's what I'm trying to say.

26:35.875 --> 26:39.541
I think that things have been
unfair in your life

26:39.625 --> 26:42.875
and I know what that feels like.

26:44.333 --> 26:48.541
Look, Floss,
she's searching for something.

26:49.291 --> 26:52.875
A piece of evidence that she thinks
will pin the church fire on you.

26:55.750 --> 26:57.958
Why does she care about this?

26:58.791 --> 27:01.000
I mean, that was decades ago.

27:01.583 --> 27:04.666
She's building a bigger case
against you than just Dylan.

27:15.250 --> 27:16.583
What's this?

27:17.375 --> 27:18.500
I wanted to help.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.875
I took it out of the evidence box.

27:27.958 --> 27:29.625
Floss hasn't seen it yet,

27:29.708 --> 27:32.750
but it's also logged in
the evidence inventory,

27:32.833 --> 27:34.583
and I took that page too.

27:34.666 --> 27:36.458
It'll slow her down,

27:36.541 --> 27:40.000
but she'll pull the digital copy
eventually and find out it's missing.

27:40.916 --> 27:43.625
She knows I let Gina see the box
a few weeks ago

27:43.708 --> 27:47.333
and she'll assume
your sister took it to protect you.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.541
Either way,
you're going to get in trouble.

27:49.625 --> 27:51.333
A minor infraction.

27:53.041 --> 27:53.958
I think.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.250
Thank you.

28:03.166 --> 28:04.166
Sincerely.

28:17.208 --> 28:20.166
<i>Sheriff, she took</i>
<i>the bait. She's on the way out.</i>

28:20.250 --> 28:23.500
<i>Copy. We got the front.</i>
<i>She's not here! Pearson, you copy?</i>

28:23.583 --> 28:25.416
<i>We didn't see her</i>
<i>come out the back.</i>

28:25.500 --> 28:28.375
<i>God damn it!</i>
<i>All units, find her! Go!</i>

28:40.875 --> 28:42.166
Single file!

28:46.333 --> 28:47.875
Easy. Easy there!

28:50.166 --> 28:52.708
Mattie! Hey!

28:54.166 --> 28:55.541
Honey, come here.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.250
Hey, hon!

29:01.916 --> 29:04.125
Daddy says
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

29:05.416 --> 29:08.000
Yeah, I know. But just this once, okay?

29:08.083 --> 29:11.583
Because, um… You know
when I was about your age,

29:11.666 --> 29:13.416
my mom had to go away.

29:15.708 --> 29:17.375
And I have to do the same thing.

29:18.166 --> 29:19.541
Where are you going?

29:20.125 --> 29:22.041
I just have to figure some things out.

29:23.375 --> 29:29.875
Look, what I'm trying to say is
that I love you so much, honey.

29:31.375 --> 29:33.875
I hope you can forgive me
for what I'm doing.

29:35.166 --> 29:36.791
-Someday, I'm--
-Mattie, Mattie, Mattie!

29:36.875 --> 29:38.625
Come here! Trisha caught a baby bird!

29:39.791 --> 29:41.166
Be there in a minute.

29:48.000 --> 29:48.833
All right.

29:50.791 --> 29:54.500
I love you and I'll see you. Okay?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.750
I'll see you from wherever I am.

30:01.625 --> 30:02.625
Okay.

30:07.625 --> 30:10.208
-Okay, I'm coming!

30:11.000 --> 30:13.083
Jesus! What's going on, sheriff?

30:13.166 --> 30:14.958
-Leni here?
-Of course not.

30:15.041 --> 30:16.666
Sure about that? Could she be hiding?

30:16.750 --> 30:19.000
What is going on?
Leni doesn't live here no more.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.958
We checked the hotel.
She hasn't been there.

30:21.041 --> 30:22.625
We need to find her now! Go look.

30:22.708 --> 30:23.708
Well, she's not here.

30:23.791 --> 30:26.375
Look upstairs!
Have you checked the stables this morning?

30:26.458 --> 30:28.375
Yeah, I did.
She's not there either.

30:28.458 --> 30:30.291
I haven't seen her since last night.

30:30.833 --> 30:34.000
Did you try Ernie? I mean,
he's representing her. Maybe he knows.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.500
He saw her earlier today,
but she's not taking his calls.

30:36.583 --> 30:38.208
Mine either. Do you mind trying?

30:43.083 --> 30:44.833
Leni, it's me. Call me back.

30:44.916 --> 30:49.625
Clearly you know something's going on.
Let me help you. Call me.

30:54.416 --> 30:55.291
Lions.

30:58.041 --> 30:59.083
Yeah?

30:59.166 --> 31:01.583
These belong to you or, uh…

31:02.208 --> 31:03.291
No, those are Leni's.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.958
Her mom used to call her Leni the Lion.

31:26.416 --> 31:27.250
Next.

31:30.916 --> 31:32.708
-Afternoon.
-Hello.

31:32.791 --> 31:35.166
Got a passport or ID
to go along this ticket?

31:35.250 --> 31:36.125
I do.

31:38.416 --> 31:40.541
-So where are you headed today?
-Australia.

31:40.625 --> 31:42.833
-Wow, glamorous!
-Is it?

31:42.916 --> 31:44.916
I got no idea.
I just see the posters.

31:51.333 --> 31:52.416
All right, Kira.

32:05.666 --> 32:07.666
This thing has been
acting squirrelly all day.

32:07.750 --> 32:13.250
I'm sorry. Do you have a driver's license,
Global Entry card or something like that?

32:13.333 --> 32:15.958
No. I thought
the passport would be enough.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.875
-Hmm. Got it. It's all good.

32:31.708 --> 32:33.291
Have a pleasant flight, Kira.

32:34.666 --> 32:35.500
Thank you.

32:37.916 --> 32:41.000
Wait. Wait, wait.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.833
Didn't you come past me yesterday?

32:46.375 --> 32:47.291
Um, no.

32:47.916 --> 32:50.750
You look exactly like this woman
who came through here yesterday.

32:51.708 --> 32:54.291
Really? Where was she headed?

32:55.041 --> 32:56.291
Kansas, I think.

32:57.750 --> 33:00.625
Kansas. Nope. Wasn't me.

33:01.291 --> 33:02.916
They say everyone has a twin.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.416
-Really?
-Yeah.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.208
I just hope mine has a better job.

33:07.125 --> 33:08.208
Have a good one.

33:10.791 --> 33:11.791
Next.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.833
<i>"Dylan represented something</i>
<i>we all yearn for,</i>

33:21.583 --> 33:23.000
<i>"the Return to Eden.</i>

33:25.125 --> 33:27.333
<i>"To the way things never really were.</i>

33:28.041 --> 33:29.875

34:04.083 --> 34:07.333

34:15.500 --> 34:19.333

34:19.416 --> 34:21.666
"That there is

34:21.750 --> 34:24.166

35:09.041 --> 35:10.875
Thank you.

35:10.958 --> 35:12.375
Um…

35:13.416 --> 35:16.333
We've got a little time left
for some questions, I believe.

35:17.708 --> 35:19.500
Yes. You in the back.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.208
I'm interested to know,

35:21.291 --> 35:24.333
the sister who killed herself
in the Falls…

35:24.416 --> 35:25.916
Did they ever find a body?

35:28.250 --> 35:29.750
Uh…

35:29.833 --> 35:32.166
No. No, that was Gina,

35:33.583 --> 35:34.625
my wife.

35:34.708 --> 35:39.250
And the sheriff and the search teams
told me that with all the undergrowth,

35:39.333 --> 35:42.250
all of the fallen trees,
that the body could have lodged there.

35:43.833 --> 35:46.708
And that's just one of a ton
of things that could have happened.

35:49.708 --> 35:50.666
Yes, you.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.750
So I'm an identical twin myself.

35:54.833 --> 35:57.083
And when my brother and I
were in junior high,

35:57.166 --> 35:59.208
we'd occasionally swap, because, you see,

35:59.291 --> 36:02.375
I preferred the humanities
and he was more into the sciences…

36:25.458 --> 36:29.333
You know, it felt silly sometimes,
not changing the locks.

36:31.041 --> 36:33.375
Like I was holding out
too much hope, you know?

36:34.125 --> 36:35.875
-Not being realistic.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.375
-Doesn't sound like you.

36:38.916 --> 36:41.666
Well, this changed me.

36:45.208 --> 36:46.416
Probably for the better.

36:47.583 --> 36:48.666
That's nice to hear.

36:48.750 --> 36:51.083
You prefer a twist,
if I remember correctly.

36:51.166 --> 36:52.583
-That's right.
-Hmm.

36:54.291 --> 36:57.166
I did think the hat and glasses
were bit much though.

36:57.250 --> 36:58.500
The hat and glasses?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.666
Yes, at the reading just now.

37:01.750 --> 37:03.958
That was you, right?
With the first question?

37:04.041 --> 37:05.750
Uh… No.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.333
I've been waiting here tonight
for over an hour.

37:13.625 --> 37:15.208
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

37:28.750 --> 37:31.375
I'll find out,
you know, which one you are.

37:31.958 --> 37:35.000
Maybe. Maybe even I don't know anymore.

37:36.791 --> 37:38.791
Do you know why you came back?

37:39.416 --> 37:42.208
So many scores to settle, Charlie.

37:42.833 --> 37:44.666
Thought I should start with you.
