YAY!

19:44.516 --> 19:47.853
{\an5}TOBY,
DO THESE PANTS MAKE
MY BUTT LOOK BIG?

19:52.758 --> 19:54.159
AAH!

19:54.226 --> 19:56.061
WE ARE HURTLING
TOWARD THE SUN

19:56.128 --> 19:57.829
FOR A MOLTEN DATE
WITH DEATH.

19:57.896 --> 20:01.466
ROLL! ROLL FOR YOUR LIVES!

20:01.533 --> 20:03.735
RUN!

20:01.533 --> 20:03.735
RUN!

20:05.470 --> 20:07.139
I'VE GOT TO GET COSMO AND WANDA

20:07.205 --> 20:09.308
{\an1}AND WISH EVERYTHING
BACK TO NORMAL.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.213
NOW JUST UP THE STAIRS, AND--

20:15.280 --> 20:16.882
UGH!

20:16.949 --> 20:18.550
OH, MAN, I'M SO UNHEALTHY,

20:18.617 --> 20:20.586
I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY
TO CLIMB STAIRS.

20:20.652 --> 20:25.591
SO I'LL JUST HAVE
TO BRING THEM DOWNSTAIRS.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.729
AAH!

20:28.760 --> 20:30.729
OHH!

20:30.796 --> 20:32.831
{\an1}I WISH EVERYONE
WAS BACK TO NORMAL

20:32.898 --> 20:35.601
AND THAT THE EARTH WASN'T GONNA
CRASH INTO THE SUN.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.203
WHEW. I'M A LITTLE
WINDED, SPORT.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.839
{\an1}CAN YOU HANDLE IT
ON YOUR OWN?

20:40.906 --> 20:43.208
OH, I'LL DO IT.
HANG ON.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.043
UH, MY WAND
IS HERE SOMEWHERE.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.446
NOT MY WAND.
NOT MY WAND.

20:47.512 --> 20:50.048
HEY, THERE'S THAT DOG
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

20:50.115 --> 20:52.217
{\an1}OH, I CAN
USE MY WAND.

20:52.284 --> 20:55.787
{\an5}OH, IF ONLY
I HAD ENOUGH ENERGY
TO WAVE MY ARM.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.456
{\an1}OH, MAN,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.524
{\an1}YOU DO NEED
HEALTHY FOODS TO HAVE

20:59.591 --> 21:01.627
{\an1}THE ENERGY TO DO THINGS
LIKE LIFT YOUR ARMS.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.529
BUT ALL THE FOOD
IN THE WORLD IS DESSERT.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.832
{\an5}AND NOBODY EATS
HEALTHY FOOD
FOR DESSERT.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.234
HEY, THERE'S THAT COWBOY
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

21:09.301 --> 21:10.902
HOWDY DO?

21:10.969 --> 21:13.505
{\an4}HEALTHY FOOD
FOR DESSERT.
THAT'S IT.

21:13.572 --> 21:16.108
Mark:
I DON'T KNOW, TURNER.

21:16.174 --> 21:20.679
{\an5}WHY WOULD I
GIVE YOU MY LAST CAN
OF SPINACH COBBLER?

21:20.746 --> 21:24.983
'TIS THE TASTIEST OF ALL
YUGOPOTAMIAN DESSERTS.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.320
{\an5}SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WON'T HELP ME SAVE
MY DOOMED PLANET?

21:28.387 --> 21:30.355
UH, YEAH.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.290
AAH! STOP!

21:32.357 --> 21:35.427
{\an8}FOR EVEN UNDER EARTH'S
LIGHTER GRAVITY,

21:35.494 --> 21:38.730
{\an8}YOU ARE CRUSHING
MY GELATINOUS FORM.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.399
THANKS.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.000
CAN I GET A LIFT
TO MY HOUSE?

21:42.067 --> 21:45.470
{\an1}ARE YOU MAD?
I CANNOT LIFT YOU.

21:45.537 --> 21:47.139
I MEANT
WITH YOUR SHIP.

21:47.205 --> 21:50.075
{\an1}OH. MM'K.

21:51.176 --> 21:54.212
Timmy: AAH!

21:56.615 --> 21:57.716

21:57.783 --> 21:59.217
THIS MIGHT TASTE BAD,

21:59.284 --> 22:01.687
{\an1}BUT IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE GOOD FOR YOU.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.658
[ALARM BELL RINGS]

22:11.663 --> 22:16.468
AT LONG LAST, MY DREAM POOL
IS FINISHED.

22:16.535 --> 22:19.304
MY DREAM POOL--RUINED!

22:19.371 --> 22:22.507
FORGIVE ME,
DIMMSDALE POOL AND SPA EMPORIUM!

22:22.574 --> 22:25.143
QUICK, BEFORE I
RUN OUT OF ENERGY.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.312
{\an1}I WISH EVERYTHING
WAS BACK TO NORMAL!

22:45.464 --> 22:46.565
Timmy: LESSON LEARNED--

22:46.631 --> 22:48.333
DESSERT IS GREAT ON OCCASION,

22:48.400 --> 22:51.136
BUT BALANCED DIETS
ARE WHAT KEEPS US ALL HEALTHY

22:51.203 --> 22:53.338
{\an1}AND NOT HURTLING

22:53.405 --> 22:54.940
YEAH, BUT THESE ROLLS
ARE SO CONVENIENT,

22:55.006 --> 22:56.208
I JUST COULDN'T
GET RID OF THEM.

22:56.274 --> 22:59.845
{\an1}Wanda: COSMO,
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

22:59.911 --> 23:01.613
NOT WANDA.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.983
NOT WANDA.
NOT WANDA.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.753
