OUT OF THEIR
HOMES, OKAY?

19:26.665 --> 19:27.624
{\an1}I-I-I MEAN
IT <i> IS</i> KIND OF LATE.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.751
THEY CHICKENED OUT.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.086
WE WIN BY DEFAULT.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.588
CAN WE GO NOW?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.755
THAT'S NOT HOW I WANTED TO WIN.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.301
IN YOUR FACE, LARS!

19:37.384 --> 19:39.052
IN YOUR FACE!

19:39.136 --> 19:40.137
KEEP IT UP, TWISTER

19:40.220 --> 19:42.389
AN-AND I'LL TELL MOM
ALL ABOUT TONIGHT.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.432
HAPPY, OTTO?

19:43.515 --> 19:44.766
COME ON, SAMMY.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.226
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.021
NOW YOU CAN'T
EVER CALL US M...

19:49.104 --> 19:50.814
(<i> siren blares</i> )

19:52.900 --> 19:54.902
Officer (<i> through bullhorn</i> ):
ATTENTION, MUNCHKINS

19:54.985 --> 19:57.738
STEP AWAY
FROM YOUR HOCKEY STICKS.

19:57.821 --> 19:58.447
"MUNCHKINS"?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.782
(<i> laughing</i> )

20:00.866 --> 20:03.952
HEY, HAVE FUN IN THE JOINT.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.287
THE JOINT?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.456
THAT'S STREET TALK
FOR PRISON.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.041
(<i> snoring</i> )

20:10.208 --> 20:12.169

20:16.006 --> 20:16.632
HOLD IT!

20:16.715 --> 20:18.967
(<i> sniffing</i> )

20:19.051 --> 20:21.303
UH, UH, I WAS GOING
TO PICK UP AFTER HIM.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.638
I SWEAR IT!

20:22.721 --> 20:26.475
AND THEN WHAT-- TAKE A NICE
REFRESHING DIP IN MY POOL?

20:26.558 --> 20:27.684
(<i> gasps</i> )

20:27.768 --> 20:29.144
THE PROWLER!

20:29.227 --> 20:30.312
CARRY ON.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.272
UH, UH, A-AS YOU WERE.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.815
CAUGHT YOU RED...

OH.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.402
MERV, MY STARS!

20:37.486 --> 20:40.155
{\an1}YOU SCARED THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS
OUT OF ME.

20:40.238 --> 20:41.740
V-V-V-V-VIOLET?

20:41.823 --> 20:43.825
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME?!

20:43.909 --> 20:45.327
{\an1}OH, MERV

20:45.410 --> 20:46.620
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.580
I HAVEN'T FELT THIS FREE

20:48.664 --> 20:50.999
SINCE THEY INVENTED
ELASTIC WAISTBANDS.

20:51.083 --> 20:55.712
Officer:
<i>FOR THE LAST TIME, SON</i>

20:55.796 --> 20:58.006
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.968
I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.178
DUDE,
THEY'RE JUST TAKING US HOME.

21:03.261 --> 21:05.347
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU
TO THINK.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.809
<i>THIS IS GOING</i>
<i>ON MY PERMANENT RECORD.</i>

21:09.893 --> 21:11.186
(<i> ringing</i> )

21:11.269 --> 21:12.396
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

21:15.273 --> 21:16.608
SHIRLEY?

21:16.692 --> 21:18.694
RAY, IT'S <i> OFFICER</i> SHIRLEY.

21:18.777 --> 21:19.569
FOUND YOUR KIDS.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.030
{\an1}Ray:
KIDS?

21:22.114 --> 21:22.572
FOUND THEM?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.741
DOING WHAT?

21:24.825 --> 21:27.577
{\an1}THE <i> GANG</i> HERE
WAS OUT PLAYING HOCKEY

21:27.661 --> 21:29.204
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.498
ASIDE FROM THAT,
NO REAL HARM DONE.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.710
THIS TIME, WE'LL LET THEM OFF...
WITH A WARNING.

21:34.793 --> 21:38.547
I, UH... APPRECIATE
YOUR LENIENCY, SHIRL--

21:38.630 --> 21:40.632
UM...<i> OFFICER</i> SHIRLEY.

(<i> hinges squeak</i> )

21:45.887 --> 21:46.471
(<i> dog yelping</i> )

21:46.555 --> 21:48.724
{\an1}OH, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE HERE!

21:48.807 --> 21:51.143
{\an1}A STRANGE MAN JUMPED
OUT OF THE BUSHES

21:51.226 --> 21:53.061
AND HE SCARED
MY SCHNAUZER.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.523
{\an1}HE TOOK OFF RUNNING
AND THEN I HEARD A LADY SCREAM!

21:56.606 --> 21:57.816
WHICH WAY DID HE GO?

21:57.899 --> 21:58.650
THAT A-WAY.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.903
{\an1}OKAY, WHO'S GOING
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH?

22:01.987 --> 22:03.071
DAD, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.533
I PUSHED EVERYBODY
INTO DOING THIS.

22:06.616 --> 22:10.203
{\an1}IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUNISH
SOMEONE, I'M YOUR MAN.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.288
FINE.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.915
THEN IT'S GARBAGE DUTY
FOR YOU, OTTO...

22:13.999 --> 22:15.417
THREE WHOLE WEEKS.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.794
{\an1}WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS
IN THE MORNING.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.172
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
MIGHT NOT RESPECT YOU

22:20.255 --> 22:23.175
IF THEY SEE ME TAKING THE
HEAT FOR THIS ALL ALONE.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.510
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU <i> HAVE</i> TO HELP ME

22:25.594 --> 22:26.636
WITH THIS GARBAGE DUTY, BUT...

22:26.720 --> 22:27.596
FORGET IT.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.638
{\an5}NOT A CHANCE.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.183
GOOD NIGHT.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.268
IT WAS WORTH A TRY.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.776
{\an1}SAY, RAY...
CAN YOU MAKE AN IDENTIFICATION?

22:40.859 --> 22:42.527
{\an1}WE'VE GOT A SUSPECT
IN CUSTODY

22:42.611 --> 22:44.529

FOR HIM.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.781
