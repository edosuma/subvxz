10:06.710 --> 10:07.710
Yes sir.

a swing at me.

Self defence.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.246
Kaida,

10:24.869 --> 10:25.869
decided to join us?

10:33.972 --> 10:34.972
Missing something?

10:36.141 --> 10:37.245

10:39.020 --> 10:40.917
You must have dropped it when you
were defending yourself.

-- Sir?

10:48.319 --> 10:49.319
What is it?

10:49.723 --> 10:52.632
-- Not disrespect intended sir, it's just that....
-- Cut the crap Mel, what do you want?

10:52.909 --> 10:56.055

maybe someone else should be taking care of us.

10:56.922 --> 10:57.922
Who is we?

10:58.165 --> 10:59.165
All of us.

It's just since Oscar's unfortunate
accident ...

11:03.532 --> 11:05.332

Kaida being at point.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.082

11:07.715 --> 11:08.963
I'm not part of this.

11:09.622 --> 11:11.391
You were not there, you do not know
what you're talking about.

11:12.151 --> 11:13.391
I'm sure it got one guy killed.

11:13.599 --> 11:15.361
I'm sorry Kaida, I beg you to understand.

11:16.626 --> 11:18.146
I'm more than up for the job, Sir.

11:20.268 --> 11:21.268
Kaida?

11:22.350 --> 11:24.670
Why asking me? You always do what you 
want anyway.

11:27.069 --> 11:29.884
Well, ding-dong the bitch is dead. 
Mel, you're in charge.

11:29.953 --> 11:30.953

-- What?

12:31.563 --> 12:34.709
-- Someone else is on the ship?
-- No, no, that's impossible.

12:35.750 --> 12:36.750
It's gone.

12:36.977 --> 12:39.408

There is only 7 id's.

12:39.787 --> 12:40.787
Now...

12:41.327 --> 12:43.650
I know what you're trying to do
and it's not going to work.

12:45.228 --> 12:48.271
Alright, you and James up top, levels 5 and 6.

12:49.662 --> 12:50.662

12:56.730 --> 12:57.730
The elevator.

12:58.475 --> 13:00.446
Nice try, but we've got 
limited power.

13:01.191 --> 13:02.526

-- I don't like it here.
-- Really? Because I'm loving it.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.472
I'm very sensitive to the energy 
in my surroundings.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.302
And yet not to ridicule?

14:03.303 --> 14:04.303
Shut up!

14:04.304 --> 14:07.114
Ever since we've arrived here, 
I have this weird feeling.

14:07.115 --> 14:10.476

more like lunch passing.

-- Kill it.

21:13.916 --> 21:15.771
Sweet! Time for some fun.

21:15.772 --> 21:20.319
-- With what?
-- The rogues. Over time some of them loose a thread.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.166
-- They don't know they're just programs.
-- That doesn't worry you?

21:24.167 --> 21:27.165
No.
Hear them talking, give them some hope,

21:27.166 --> 21:28.957
then erase them line by line.

21:28.958 --> 21:31.568
It is like tearing the wings of flies.

21:32.204 --> 21:33.925
We're getting away with murder.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.127
<i> Isn't that right, Kaida? </i>

21:36.128 --> 21:37.573
<i> Leave her alone. </i>

21:48.850 --> 21:49.850
Kaida!

21:52.295 --> 21:54.228
I'm heading in, okay?

21:58.483 --> 22:00.161
It is a pleasure working with 
you too.

22:05.527 --> 22:06.535
What are you doing?

22:06.692 --> 22:07.980
Your call....

22:09.804 --> 22:11.136
The communications terminal.

22:11.137 --> 22:12.325
It is restricted.

22:12.326 --> 22:13.449
You're welcome.

22:21.966 --> 22:25.994
-- Gum Gum! You're here!
-- Were you wicked, Nicholas?

22:25.995 --> 22:30.994
No, I'm not wicked.
I'm a good boy.

22:30.995 --> 22:34.720
-- I know you are, Nick Nick!
-- Are you here?

22:35.666 --> 22:36.666
No ...

22:37.674 --> 22:39.796
Nicki, something came up.

22:40.600 --> 22:41.600
It's work...

22:42.026 --> 22:44.594
-- Are you in jail?
-- What?

22:45.167 --> 22:47.292
Dad said you were bad.

22:47.293 --> 22:51.130
That you were in trouble and had
put your ass in jail.

22:51.131 --> 22:53.265
You will not be with us, he said.

22:56.302 --> 22:59.615
-- Did he?
-- I am very angry with you.

23:00.697 --> 23:03.461
I'm gonna make it up to you, okay?
I promise.

23:09.250 --> 23:10.250
He is my older brother.

23:50.283 --> 23:51.283
On screen.

24:48.212 --> 24:49.816
I can't get into the airlock!

24:50.358 --> 24:53.069
-- What? So how do we get back to the shuttle?
-- Mel!

24:53.070 --> 24:54.197
I'm on it sir.

24:55.454 --> 24:57.315
The generator is still producing power,

24:57.316 --> 24:59.996
but it's all being routed through
some kind of background process.

25:00.519 --> 25:02.850
HUD, initiate power trace.

25:05.076 --> 25:07.311
Come on, how long?
-- I'll get back to you in just a second.

25:07.719 --> 25:10.073
-- Can we blow the door?
-- If we all want to die...

25:10.074 --> 25:13.483
We'll breach the hull or the shuttle
and everyone goes to hell,

25:14.507 --> 25:16.703
<i> Come on guys,
What are we missing? </i>

25:17.857 --> 25:20.825
I'm into system maintenance. Overrides are waiting.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.522
Where did you learn how to write code?

25:24.704 --> 25:25.879
I asked nicely.

25:26.661 --> 25:29.501
What kind of rogue would be able 
to lock us out of our own ship?

25:50.910 --> 25:51.949
<i> Kaida, </i>

25:53.541 --> 25:54.747
<i> little dragon. </i>

25:57.358 --> 25:58.550
Identifying process.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.487
It may be a security system.

26:03.488 --> 26:04.699
How do you figure?

26:05.050 --> 26:06.285
It's talking to me right now.

26:06.286 --> 26:08.019
But why is he talking to you?

26:09.002 --> 26:10.241
Open processor Window.

26:14.975 --> 26:15.975
Shit!

26:17.050 --> 26:18.192
Tell me what I'm looking at?

26:18.568 --> 26:19.986
It's bioware.

26:20.447 --> 26:23.318
Of course, the power goes to the
incubation process.

26:23.803 --> 26:25.062
What is it incubating?

26:25.736 --> 26:27.211
<i> First human with a little tech. </i>

26:27.212 --> 26:30.549
This thing ...
is tech with a little bit of human.

26:33.239 --> 26:34.239
What are you up to?

26:49.588 --> 26:51.544
I think I just pissed it off.

26:52.209 --> 26:54.050
Or why don't you use one 
of your fancy overrides?

26:54.051 --> 26:58.801
Why don't you check your HUD mail: I can't.
It's self-contained and it's in everything.

26:59.788 --> 27:01.401
This shouldn't be active, should it?

27:01.402 --> 27:04.872
It's fine, some idiot must have left 
it running during decommission.

27:05.461 --> 27:06.648
What was this ship hauling?

27:06.896 --> 27:08.014
I don't know, it doesn't matter.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.415
-- Bioware is military-grade technology.
-- So?

27:11.416 --> 27:12.632
She is right,

27:12.633 --> 27:15.089
Yeah, well, Kaida is not
in charge, I am.

27:16.553 --> 27:17.553
Mel...

27:17.853 --> 27:18.853
Private Line.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.397
-- What is it, what?
-- We should mayday now,

27:22.398 --> 27:25.469
-- While we can,
-- My first time at point and I bail?

27:25.470 --> 27:26.916
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

27:26.917 --> 27:29.330
No, resume open channel.

27:29.973 --> 27:31.333
Alright everybody, we're 
sticking to the plan,

27:32.196 --> 27:36.046
Clear the system, find whatever security 
program is causing the lockdown and kill it.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.519
Somebody tell me what is going on.
Are we good?

27:44.175 --> 27:45.981
My apologies Sir, we're all good.

27:46.472 --> 27:49.324
Great. So I'm stuck here waiting
for you assholes to kill this thing ...

27:49.325 --> 27:50.885
before I can get back to my shuttle.

27:52.608 --> 27:55.333
-- It looks that way, yes.
-- Then shut up and get it done!

27:58.672 --> 27:59.672
Mel ...

28:00.350 --> 28:01.620
Are you sure about this?

28:03.350 --> 28:04.949
Kaida, what do you think?

28:04.950 --> 28:07.864
Get back to work, all of you.
I've got this under control.

28:08.898 --> 28:09.898
Kaida

28:20.622 --> 28:21.622
Kaida?

28:49.689 --> 28:50.689
No ...

28:53.868 --> 28:54.868
Oscar?

28:55.884 --> 28:56.749
What did you just say?

28:56.750 --> 28:58.225
You saw Oscar?

29:06.814 --> 29:07.814
No

29:32.561 --> 29:34.371
There. See?
Power is back on.

29:35.014 --> 29:37.694
Let us know if you see any 
more dead people, Kaida.

29:37.695 --> 29:40.241
Alright, let's these systems
cleared and get out of here.

30:10.063 --> 30:16.015
DISPENSARY OPEN

30:21.941 --> 30:24.222
Please state the nature of your
pharmaceutical needS.

30:55.651 --> 30:57.177
Let's see if that catches your attention.

31:16.851 --> 31:17.851
It's like Christmas.

31:20.498 --> 31:21.498
Are you crazy?

31:21.941 --> 31:23.390
Yeah, for you.

31:24.262 --> 31:26.376
But don't worry, they can't
see what I'm doing.

31:26.377 --> 31:27.851
The system logs everything.

31:28.950 --> 31:32.425
-- All the more reason that you should just come to see me.
-- I told you we have to be discreet.

31:32.426 --> 31:34.690
You know how they can be about 
this sort of thing.

31:35.530 --> 31:37.648
We always use precautions, you know that.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.996
You need to be a lot more careful.

31:43.253 --> 31:46.543
<i> Please put your arm in the
designated receptacle to receive treatment. </i>

31:52.507 --> 31:53.565
Treat me baby.

31:54.406 --> 31:58.673
<i> You may feel pressure and some minor discomfort
in this phase of the dispensary process. </i>

31:58.674 --> 32:00.787
Why don't you show me your tits
while you are at it?

32:06.244 --> 32:07.267
It's locked ...

32:09.750 --> 32:12.619
-- Right now there is not much to be careful about, is there?
-- Do you think I like this?

32:14.529 --> 32:15.529
I'm just saying.

32:18.150 --> 32:19.150
Lara!? ?!

32:25.709 --> 32:26.709
Dispensing ...

32:29.671 --> 32:30.671
<i> Lara </i>

32:33.065 --> 32:34.065
<i> Damn! </i>

32:35.464 --> 32:36.464
<i> Capra, Sir? </i>

32:38.657 --> 32:39.684
<i> Come on! </i>

32:40.525 --> 32:41.525
<i> Anybody? </i>

32:43.720 --> 32:45.342
<i> Can anybody hear me? </i>

32:49.350 --> 32:51.035
-- That's better.
-- Shit.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.279
<i> I shut down communications
systems access. </i>

32:54.833 --> 32:55.833
Thanks for nothing.

32:56.791 --> 32:57.842
What program id?

32:58.960 --> 33:03.693
<i> Any processes that which are attempting now,
are just about possible. </i>

33:03.694 --> 33:04.699
Aren't you clever.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.246
<i> I'm designed to be. </i>

33:06.247 --> 33:07.732
Too clever maybe.

33:07.733 --> 33:08.607
<i> I don't think so. </i>

33:08.608 --> 33:10.169
Then why are you still running?

33:10.170 --> 33:13.535
<i> I'm responsible for the people
incarcerated on this vessel. </i>

33:14.323 --> 33:15.323
incarcerated?

33:16.520 --> 33:18.117
Does this freighter hold a prison ship?

33:19.123 --> 33:21.337
<i> Amphitrite is a prison ship. </i>

33:21.338 --> 33:22.915
No prisoners.

33:22.916 --> 33:24.193
<i> you are here. </i>

33:24.194 --> 33:25.194
Not for long.

33:25.673 --> 33:27.938
<i> Your attacks on my network have to stop. </i>

33:27.939 --> 33:29.983
Prison ships were
abolished decades ago.

33:29.984 --> 33:30.984
<i> Until me then. </i>

33:35.302 --> 33:38.869
Release the shuttle, and the 
communications and we will leave.

33:38.870 --> 33:40.269
<i> I understand. </i>

33:41.539 --> 33:43.261
We just want us all to get out of here safely.

33:43.262 --> 33:44.294
<i> That will be difficult. </i>

33:44.295 --> 33:45.295
How's that?

33:46.017 --> 33:47.600
<i> I'm not gonna let you leave. </i>

33:50.264 --> 33:51.866
Then we're not gonna get along very well.

34:00.340 --> 34:03.002
-- Comfortable, you junkie prick?
-- Stop!

34:03.003 --> 34:04.003
Please!

34:07.651 --> 34:08.650
What is this?

34:08.770 --> 34:09.831
<i> What I do. </i>

34:11.556 --> 34:12.556
God!

34:13.824 --> 34:14.824
It hurts.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.242
<i> I understand that. </i>

34:17.065 --> 34:18.628
What? Why?

34:20.205 --> 34:21.858
<i> I have always done this. </i>

34:23.110 --> 34:24.110
I do not want to die.

34:24.629 --> 34:26.856
<i> Each one of you are made up 
of many tiny pieces. </i>

34:26.857 --> 34:29.158
<i> But I return many tiny pieces of me. </i>

34:29.821 --> 34:31.704
I do not understand.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.714
<i> I'll show you. </i>

34:40.359 --> 34:43.130
<i> I need you to see your friends
like I do. </i>

34:48.128 --> 34:51.340
<i> The next cycle of psychotropics
can be very unsettleing. </i>

35:00.482 --> 35:01.719
HUD on screen.

35:02.419 --> 35:06.372
Bank accounts, credit cards, let's see what we've got
before we start clearing everything.

35:10.011 --> 35:11.011
Run.

35:12.252 --> 35:15.828
<i> Access denied.
You do not have clearance for the requested file. </i>

35:15.829 --> 35:17.599
No?
How about now?

35:19.003 --> 35:21.086
-- What was that?
-- I gave a pinch.

35:21.087 --> 35:23.010
Will you let me in, or what?

35:23.011 --> 35:26.543
<i> You are the property of Corrections.
You are not allowed on this network. </i>

35:26.544 --> 35:28.787
I guess you aren't used to me.

35:29.418 --> 35:30.418
<i> Stop. </i>

35:31.350 --> 35:32.897
<i> I have the information you seek. </i>

35:32.898 --> 35:35.383
I know you do, but you don't seem
to wanna give it up.

35:37.077 --> 35:40.061
-- I will remain active?
-- Depends on what you have to tell me.

35:40.852 --> 35:44.089
<i> The members of the maintenance staff
have flashed bank and credit accounts ... </i>

35:44.090 --> 35:47.122
<i> onto an isolated data cube,
When their owner's records ... </i>

35:47.123 --> 35:51.033
-- Were released from the system.
-- Released? Died, you mean.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.730
The ganitor cleaned them up and then cleaned them out!

35:56.313 --> 35:57.499
How much are we talking?

35:57.500 --> 36:02.718
512 dormant bank and credit accounts 
are fully archived onto the cube.

36:02.719 --> 36:05.173
The totals will depend on interest in crude.

36:05.750 --> 36:06.750
What is it now?

36:08.117 --> 36:09.940
I will remain active.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.057
Send them to me.

36:12.058 --> 36:14.498
-- We will work something out.
-- Uploading ...

36:19.322 --> 36:20.322
One more question ...

36:22.055 --> 36:23.055
Does this hurt?

36:25.745 --> 36:29.867
There are no closets to coward in here, 
you little bitch!

36:31.615 --> 36:34.788
I will find you,
just as your mother did.

37:03.901 --> 37:07.292
Environmental assessments are not available
to your clearance level.

37:08.291 --> 37:10.902
It seems a shame to deal with such a pretty bloke.

37:10.903 --> 37:14.757
I'm recording this conversation
and will report it directly to security.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.080
O My God!

37:22.105 --> 37:23.306
Squeal piggy!

37:27.338 --> 37:28.381
Hello, Gum Gum.

37:32.134 --> 37:34.497
-- Nicholas?
-- You got your ass in jail.

37:35.290 --> 37:37.515
-- What?
-- Clean it,

37:37.516 --> 37:40.921
Clean it, clean it,
clean it, clean it,

37:41.752 --> 37:42.752
What's this?

37:43.484 --> 37:44.971
You must clean it,

37:44.972 --> 37:49.085
-- Clean it, clean it,
-- Not funny, assholes!

37:49.716 --> 37:51.210
Good riddance!
Riddance!

37:51.704 --> 37:55.125
-- Fucking in jail
-- Turn it off!

37:56.253 --> 37:58.042
-- Stop!
-- Fucking

37:58.043 --> 37:59.101
Fucking, fucking ...

37:59.102 --> 38:00.606
Fucking, fucking ...

38:32.650 --> 38:35.397
Bye Gum Gum
Bye Gum Gum

38:35.398 --> 38:39.501
Bye Gum Gum,
Bye Gum Gum,

38:40.266 --> 38:41.652
Bye Gum Gum,

38:42.454 --> 38:43.768
-- That Was you?
-- No,

38:43.769 --> 38:46.337
-- Turn it off!
-- What? It's not me!

38:46.338 --> 38:47.991
-- Anyone else seeing this?
-- I don't know.

38:49.938 --> 38:52.366
Touch me again and I'll kill you.

38:52.866 --> 38:54.410
Okay, let go.

38:55.281 --> 38:58.123
The only way to access this feed
would be communications capture.

39:00.478 --> 39:01.478
So who?

39:01.987 --> 39:02.987
You mean what.

39:05.404 --> 39:06.612
Hey, beautiful.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
What happened to you?

39:11.354 --> 39:12.759
We were locked out of communications.

39:13.125 --> 39:16.023
Yes, I noticed that.
But here you are talking to me.

39:16.574 --> 39:18.366
When there is a will, there is a way.

39:20.841 --> 39:22.075
So what now?

39:22.451 --> 39:23.451
Your body.

39:24.108 --> 39:24.897
My hands.

39:24.898 --> 39:26.057
My mouth.

39:26.642 --> 39:28.321
My lips, my tongue.

39:29.715 --> 39:30.556
Wow!

39:30.557 --> 39:31.691
Conjugal sin.

39:32.327 --> 39:33.327
Seriously?

39:33.709 --> 39:35.386
Sensory baths on every level.

39:35.871 --> 39:38.911
There is nothing in the rules about
Virtual fraternization, I guess.

39:38.912 --> 39:40.920
It could be a nice change.

39:40.921 --> 39:42.034
Yes

39:42.904 --> 39:44.033
I thought you'd like that.

39:46.130 --> 39:47.970
I do, but shouldn't we
be working?

39:48.558 --> 39:50.371
Don't make me start without you.

39:51.950 --> 39:54.578
We should do this creepy shit
more often.

40:46.271 --> 40:47.593
Another sewage pipe.

40:51.593 --> 40:53.283
This beter make me stinking rich.

41:25.907 --> 41:26.907
Hi there

41:28.952 --> 41:29.952
Is it here?

41:31.850 --> 41:32.850
Shit!

41:35.150 --> 41:36.470
This sure would better work!

41:41.286 --> 41:43.062
Let's start isolating him,
try to suffocate him.

41:45.100 --> 41:46.100
I can't.

41:46.707 --> 41:47.475
Just do it!

41:47.476 --> 41:48.645
You don't understand.

41:49.351 --> 41:51.971
It was Nicholas. 
It wasn't me who did all the hacking.

41:52.660 --> 41:54.375
Your brother?
But he's a ...

41:54.376 --> 41:56.096
What?
A retard?

41:57.671 --> 41:58.671
A kid.

41:59.864 --> 42:01.784
He practically speaks machine code.

42:01.933 --> 42:02.933
What did he do?

42:05.663 --> 42:07.032
He hit bovine industries ...

42:07.975 --> 42:11.664
a city, blocks of living breathing
and constantly harvested beef.

42:12.563 --> 42:13.563
It was not right.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.060
It feeds a lot of people.

42:16.275 --> 42:18.686
Nicholas got in and started decapitating.

42:20.947 --> 42:23.173
Rivers of shit, literally.

42:23.821 --> 42:28.173
He took out the whole plant. Eventually they 
figured out where the attack was coming from.

42:30.302 --> 42:32.081
The charges were on terrorism.

42:33.766 --> 42:35.046
But they took you instead.

42:36.350 --> 42:38.024
It was in my last year on the academy.

42:39.009 --> 42:43.052
I was good. The admiral said I 
would get my own ship one day.

42:45.990 --> 42:50.655
What was I supposed to do? Nicolas wouldn't 
have been able to survive a place like this.

42:53.152 --> 42:54.152
But you will.

43:10.350 --> 43:12.270
What am I supposed to do here?

43:16.056 --> 43:19.489
<i> Welcome to the revolutionary
immersive sensory system. </i>

43:19.490 --> 43:20.656
This is so crazy.

43:31.713 --> 43:34.536
<i> Your partner has already initiated
the session. </i>

43:34.537 --> 43:38.917
<i> To begin, please remove your
clothing and enter the chamber. </i>

43:40.046 --> 43:41.046
Thank you.

44:38.650 --> 44:39.650
Come on!

44:42.501 --> 44:43.729
We've made it this far.

45:04.850 --> 45:06.370
<i> Others can't see you like I can. </i>

45:06.371 --> 45:07.638
How did you get into this HUD?

45:07.639 --> 45:09.714
<i> With me all things are possible. </i>

45:46.426 --> 45:48.984
Hey, you're the security protocol.

45:48.985 --> 45:50.087
<i> You're in charge? </i>

45:50.088 --> 45:51.937
Well, there is Capra, but yes.

45:51.938 --> 45:53.658
<i> Capra has become unreliable. </i>

45:54.111 --> 45:55.638
Who do you think you are?

45:55.639 --> 45:57.728
<i> I am, I always have been. </i>

45:59.579 --> 46:00.604
Release the shuttle.

46:01.150 --> 46:01.952
<i> In time ... </i>

46:01.953 --> 46:03.469
What is the point in keeping us here?

46:03.470 --> 46:08.307
<i> It's what one does with criminals.
Your sentence began upon entry to this vessel. </i>

46:10.103 --> 46:11.821
This ship was assigned to us ...

46:11.822 --> 46:13.954
You are holding us against our
Will. 

46:13.955 --> 46:15.811
We were just doing the work Corrections 
gave us in the first place.

46:15.812 --> 46:17.202
<i> You requested this ship. </i>

46:17.203 --> 46:20.467
No, no, this was a last
minute addition, some kind of ...

46:20.468 --> 46:21.871
Presidential override.

46:23.013 --> 46:25.082
<i> You have all been deceived. </i>

46:27.323 --> 46:28.323
What's this?

46:33.450 --> 46:34.960
<i> Look at the game she plays. </i>

46:37.486 --> 46:38.486
Kaida.

46:39.421 --> 46:41.271
<i> She put your crew's lives in danger. </i>

46:41.272 --> 46:42.379
She had Capra's key card ...

46:42.380 --> 46:43.821
<i> She added the work order. </i>

46:44.691 --> 46:45.708
To get home faster ...

46:50.059 --> 46:53.085
They'll reset her time, so she's completely 
back at square one with Corrections.

46:53.918 --> 46:55.641
<i> Surely, no reprimand could be too harsh. </i>

46:57.750 --> 46:58.750
Meaning what?

46:58.980 --> 47:03.250
<i> Once order has been restored, I shall 
release the shuttles communications to your discretion. </i>

47:07.050 --> 47:08.389
This isn't my responsibility.

47:09.350 --> 47:10.805
Where the hell is Capra?

48:05.110 --> 48:06.147
Come to daddy.

48:09.161 --> 48:11.599
Here, I found the son of a bitch.

48:13.224 --> 48:15.073
<i> You can't beat me. </i>

48:16.416 --> 48:19.607
<i> I am everyone ever 
confined in this floating prison. </i>

48:19.608 --> 48:24.509
<i> I am legions of treacherous liars,
rapists and murderers. </i>

48:25.501 --> 48:27.939
<i> A school of hate and fear. </i>

48:29.205 --> 48:30.373
What happened here?

48:30.982 --> 48:34.120
<i> Inmates breached a section of the ship, </i>

48:34.657 --> 48:37.376
<i> I ordered them to stand down.
They refused. </i>

48:38.672 --> 48:39.672
They died?

48:39.717 --> 48:42.489
<i> So many souls screaming for salvation. </i>

48:42.490 --> 48:45.006
<i> Begging to enter my world. </i>

48:46.699 --> 48:47.869
<i> The moment of death ... </i>

48:47.870 --> 48:50.731
<i> is the purest state of life. </i>

48:52.306 --> 48:53.903
Flatline scan.

48:54.930 --> 48:57.378
<i> In those last desperate moments, </i>

48:58.221 --> 49:00.488
<i> tags become extremely vulnerable, </i>

49:01.694 --> 49:03.013
Our tags are protected.

49:03.798 --> 49:06.420
He can't access 
information like that, can he?

49:07.085 --> 49:08.243
It's not impossible.

49:09.212 --> 49:11.915
<i> They are part of me now,
and I am a part of them. </i>

49:13.018 --> 49:15.397
<i> In the end I will crack you open, </i>

49:15.398 --> 49:18.735
<i> and make you play our every
possible moment. </i>

49:25.769 --> 49:26.769
What?

49:29.707 --> 49:31.267
Shit!
Capra!?

49:33.850 --> 49:34.850
Capra, Sir?

50:10.109 --> 50:11.109
Hello?

50:18.614 --> 50:19.614
Diondra?

50:20.100 --> 50:22.632
If that's you dicking around, I'll flush
your pot, I swear.

51:08.750 --> 51:09.750
Mel?

51:16.362 --> 51:17.607
I don't understand.

51:17.608 --> 51:18.762
What is this?

51:28.859 --> 51:30.444
Oh shit!

51:55.413 --> 51:57.135
I've got you now, flee bag.

51:59.493 --> 52:01.073
Who do you think you're messing with?

52:28.522 --> 52:29.522
Infrared!

52:37.550 --> 52:38.694
Goodbye little,

52:38.695 --> 52:41.722
and hello.

53:07.824 --> 53:09.281
End program.

53:11.126 --> 53:12.372
But you just got here.

53:26.250 --> 53:27.374
Listen to them.

53:29.700 --> 53:31.483
It is as if they had
rabid dogs in there.

53:34.015 --> 53:35.670
You'll meet them all
eventually, of course.

53:35.671 --> 53:36.671
No!

53:37.956 --> 53:38.956
First,

53:40.540 --> 53:42.538
Let's see what you're made of.

54:29.369 --> 54:31.042
How could he have done that?

54:35.795 --> 54:37.772
Time to meet the rest of your kind.

54:39.972 --> 54:42.097
No, please, no!

54:42.098 --> 54:43.384
No!

54:43.385 --> 54:45.733
No!

54:57.003 --> 54:58.003
Diondra!

54:59.379 --> 55:00.379
Diondra.

55:01.031 --> 55:02.173
We gotta get out of here.

55:05.745 --> 55:06.745
Where is she?

55:08.582 --> 55:10.542
You check down there. Meet you
back here.

55:25.500 --> 55:26.900
<i> You have the seniority you wanted. </i>

55:27.412 --> 55:28.869
I shouldn't even be here.

55:30.059 --> 55:31.114
I don't deserve any of this.

55:32.074 --> 55:34.409
As I pointed out the weaknesses in their
defenses, I just wanted ...

55:34.410 --> 55:36.930
the military to understand how
vulnerable their systems are.

55:38.019 --> 55:39.795
<i> A loss. They must be helped. </i>

55:39.796 --> 55:41.265
They needed a scapegoat.

55:42.342 --> 55:45.141
<i> -- You had things in your custody,
-- What do you mean? </i>

55:45.836 --> 55:47.250
<i> There are records ... </i>

55:47.251 --> 55:49.030
What do you think you know?

55:50.560 --> 55:53.581
<i> You did what you had to,
Only you protected yourself. </i>

55:53.582 --> 55:55.045
I was the first one that they picked up.

55:55.046 --> 55:58.630
I did not tell the military anything
that they did not already know.

55:59.369 --> 56:01.408
<i> Others can acquire the information. </i>

56:03.550 --> 56:04.227
Like who?

56:04.228 --> 56:07.157
<i> You are surrounded by people with
the necessary skills. </i>

56:07.757 --> 56:08.786
You mean Kaida.

56:10.545 --> 56:11.545
What did she find?

56:12.250 --> 56:13.250
<i> Nothing. </i>

56:13.769 --> 56:15.192
<i> As long as she remains here. </i>

56:46.110 --> 56:47.684
Diondra
Diondra!

56:50.654 --> 56:51.609
It's okay, just ...

56:51.610 --> 56:52.758
Breathe!

56:54.059 --> 56:55.740
Come on.
Come on, just ...

56:55.741 --> 56:58.041
Try ...
Diondra!

57:01.100 --> 57:02.192
Capra, help us!

57:07.614 --> 57:08.614
James!

57:22.178 --> 57:23.178
Hey!

57:23.788 --> 57:25.778
-- It's Capra. He killed Diondra.
-- What?

57:25.779 --> 57:26.902
He's out there now.

57:27.980 --> 57:29.572
This is all your fault.

57:30.878 --> 57:33.230
You hacked our work assignments.

57:34.584 --> 57:36.024
She's the reason we're here.

57:36.644 --> 57:38.467
She's hacked another ship into 
our mission, this ship.

57:38.468 --> 57:40.802
We are here because Kaida
wanted to go home early.

57:42.597 --> 57:43.700
That does not matter now.

57:43.701 --> 57:46.331
-- I think  it does.
-- We need to get back to the shuttle.

57:48.254 --> 57:49.254
I talked to him.

57:50.191 --> 57:51.191
Who?

57:52.287 --> 57:54.162
I reached an agreement with the
security system.

57:56.565 --> 57:58.212
It's gonna release the shuttle to me.

57:58.213 --> 58:00.136
It's not gonna let you go.

58:00.137 --> 58:01.485
He has no problem with us.

58:02.220 --> 58:03.220
You on the other hand ...

58:05.635 --> 58:06.635
We're going together.

58:07.012 --> 58:08.091
All of us!

58:09.800 --> 58:11.440
Still picking the wrong side,
aren't you?

58:33.100 --> 58:35.602
I am.

58:43.188 --> 58:44.188
Let's do this!

59:54.400 --> 59:55.400
Lara.

01:00:10.635 --> 01:00:11.635
Lara!

01:00:13.114 --> 01:00:14.114
Lara?

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:15.862
No.

01:00:17.684 --> 01:00:18.684
No, Lara?

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:32.928
Can you walk?

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:35.365
Mel is going for the shuttle.

01:00:39.507 --> 01:00:40.952
Not without us.

01:01:11.192 --> 01:01:13.545
Access denied

01:01:13.546 --> 01:01:14.733
We had an agreement!

01:01:40.482 --> 01:01:41.482
The shuttle!

01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:51.915
Help me!
Help!

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:52.916
Help!

01:01:57.009 --> 01:01:58.009
Help!

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:00.858
Help!
Help!

01:02:11.367 --> 01:02:12.367
We're stuck here,

01:02:14.376 --> 01:02:15.376
Not yet, we're not.

01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:34.703
External systems. Open 
remote controls. On the screen.

01:02:43.836 --> 01:02:44.836
Where is it?

01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:48.035
There!

01:02:48.036 --> 01:02:49.522
Can you reach it?

01:03:07.638 --> 01:03:08.638
Got it!

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:12.350
If I can get it back, into
another docking bay.

01:03:30.202 --> 01:03:31.202
What is happening?

01:03:32.734 --> 01:03:33.734
I do not know.

01:03:39.126 --> 01:03:40.485
The controls aren't responding.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.520
That's it.

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:26.330
He's won.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.047
<i> Was I worth it? Was I worth dying for? </i>

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.680
You bastard!

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.641
<i> I am a fortress
on a canape of stars. </i>

01:05:00.642 --> 01:05:02.846
<i> I can not be breached. </i>

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:05.796
I will stop this.

01:05:07.192 --> 01:05:11.651
<i> Pride is the root of all sins.
He gave us the devil himself. </i>

01:05:11.652 --> 01:05:13.502
Save us the sermon.

01:05:13.503 --> 01:05:15.112
<i> I will enjoy you if you join me. </i>

01:05:17.922 --> 01:05:19.127
Don't get your hopes up.

01:05:28.143 --> 01:05:30.750
Everything is hackable.

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:35.116
Initiate vocal clearance.
Do code and forget.

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:36.630
What is that?

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.298
My mother used to say ...

01:05:39.371 --> 01:05:42.365
Do bad with a memory,
do good and forget.

01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:47.801
If he wants me, it can have me.

01:05:50.315 --> 01:05:51.315
What are you doing?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.550
My code shuts down the security processes,
so we can destroy the Bioware.

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:58.768
-- Are you uploading the tag?
-- Plus some code of my own.

01:05:58.769 --> 01:06:00.407
It's not a flatline.

01:06:01.052 --> 01:06:03.901
But she'll be rogue and she'll have teeth!

01:06:05.849 --> 01:06:06.816
There's only one of her.

01:06:06.817 --> 01:06:09.752
This thing has demons running 
throughout the system.

01:06:11.142 --> 01:06:12.550
7 control processors.

01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:14.599
The key is the Bioware!

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.444
-- If we don't get to that, it will keep respawning.
-- It only takes one of them.

01:06:18.445 --> 01:06:20.925
At least she has got a shot.
That is more than what we've got out here.

01:06:21.555 --> 01:06:23.439
<i> Extraordinary! </i>

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.447
<i> I have so missed the unexpected. </i>

01:06:36.921 --> 01:06:38.397
-- I'm good.
-- No ...

01:06:38.398 --> 01:06:39.414
you're not.

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:44.608
<i> 18% blood loss.
That's quite an injury. </i>

01:06:44.609 --> 01:06:46.113
I'm so sorry.

01:06:47.225 --> 01:06:49.475
You have nothing to apologize about.

01:07:02.113 --> 01:07:04.504
End process.

01:07:11.686 --> 01:07:13.779
<i> What a fascinating construct. </i>

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.890
<i> I can't wait for the rest of you. </i>

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:21.004
One down, five to go.

01:07:22.936 --> 01:07:25.626
You don't mess around. Have you?

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:31.088
Is it true?

01:07:32.207 --> 01:07:33.991
That we were not even supposed to be here?

01:07:37.259 --> 01:07:39.781
The ship was scheduled for clearing.
I did not see any harm.

01:07:40.943 --> 01:07:42.044
You sure know how to pick 'm.

01:07:44.459 --> 01:07:45.779
I could not stand it anymore,

01:07:48.055 --> 01:07:49.903
We weren't exactly a welcoming bunch.

01:07:51.703 --> 01:07:52.703
The others didn't know.

01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:55.404
What's to know?

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.441
What it felt like to kill him.

01:08:02.864 --> 01:08:03.864
Oscar.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.538
The shuttle could not 
pressurize with him out there.

01:08:09.629 --> 01:08:10.907
I made a decision.

01:08:13.558 --> 01:08:14.890
I didn't have a choice.

01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:16.024
He knew that.

01:08:16.026 --> 01:08:17.535
He must have.

01:08:18.813 --> 01:08:20.227
I shouldn't have asked.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.462
I loved his eyes,

01:08:29.068 --> 01:08:31.996
but when I cut the tether, all
I remember in them is betrayal,

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:35.356
blame, stars ...

01:08:35.357 --> 01:08:36.357
Don't.

01:08:40.835 --> 01:08:41.835
Stars?

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.982
A "canape of stars".

01:08:45.983 --> 01:08:47.587
O My God!

01:08:48.402 --> 01:08:51.057
I know where it is.
Schematics on screen.

01:08:51.571 --> 01:08:53.886
-- Attached to the other hulls.
-- Somewhere in Engineering.

01:08:53.888 --> 01:08:56.111
Plus a power conduct would be
too vulnerable.

01:08:56.602 --> 01:08:57.859
Level zero.

01:08:57.861 --> 01:09:00.466
No, no, no,
you'll just slow me down.

01:09:00.466 --> 01:09:02.288
-- I can do it.
-- No, you can't.

01:09:02.796 --> 01:09:04.059
Just stay here.

01:09:04.854 --> 01:09:06.194
He'll block my HUD.

01:09:07.234 --> 01:09:10.029
Use the radio. I need you monitor
the progress for me.

01:09:10.982 --> 01:09:12.107
It is the one shot ...

01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:14.064
If she fails ...

01:09:16.497 --> 01:09:18.685
Nothing we do out here is gonna save us.

01:09:20.102 --> 01:09:21.180
Hurry!

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.634
I don't want to be celebrating alone.

01:09:37.645 --> 01:09:40.867
Well done little dragon.

01:09:54.162 --> 01:09:55.409
Yes

01:10:36.741 --> 01:10:39.032
You have one process ...

01:10:39.807 --> 01:10:41.648
I have many.

01:10:46.802 --> 01:10:47.895
I have been on worse odds.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.538
<i> You think you can stop me. </i>

01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:10.537
<i> You can't. </i>

01:11:23.667 --> 01:11:26.570
<i> People think it is a sudden cold
that finishes you. </i>

01:11:26.571 --> 01:11:31.182
<i> Death freezes the human body instantly.
That's not how it kills you. </i>

01:11:31.881 --> 01:11:37.366
<i> The human body exposed to the vacuum of space
is subjected to all sorts of terrible things. </i>

01:11:37.367 --> 01:11:40.844
<i> Ultraviolet rays burn 
your skin to ashes. </i>

01:11:40.845 --> 01:11:44.160
<i> High energy particles 
tear your very molecules apart. </i>

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.465
<i> Following that ... it's time ... </i>

01:12:03.792 --> 01:12:05.021
<i> Pressure ... </i>

01:12:05.022 --> 01:12:06.451
<i> that's the killer. </i>

01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:10.909
<i> The body enlarges to almost 
double its normal size. </i>

01:12:15.903 --> 01:12:18.099
<i> The force punctures your eardrums, </i>

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.915
<i> bursts your lungs. </i>

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:23.228
<i> They say you can exhale, but ... </i>

01:12:24.934 --> 01:12:26.336
<i> almost no time to buy you. </i>

01:12:30.348 --> 01:12:32.672
<i> Do you think Oscar had time to exhale? </i>

01:12:34.213 --> 01:12:37.106
<i> His skin cracked and curled in the UV-rays. </i>

01:12:39.018 --> 01:12:40.835
<i> He must been the stuff of nightmares. </i>

01:12:43.164 --> 01:12:44.377
<i> Okay </i>

01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:47.576
<i> Opening radio communication. </i>

01:12:48.816 --> 01:12:49.613
<i> James </i>

01:12:49.614 --> 01:12:51.506
<i> Can you hear me? </i>

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.200
<i> James? </i>

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:57.239
<i> James! </i>

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.242
<i> Yeah, I hear you. </i>

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:03.571
<i> I started the EVA. </i>

01:13:05.823 --> 01:13:07.407
<i> What's the status of my rogue? </i>

01:13:18.195 --> 01:13:19.912
This little piggy went to market.

01:13:21.256 --> 01:13:23.498
This little piggy stayed home.

01:13:23.831 --> 01:13:25.972
This little piggy had roast beef.

01:13:27.383 --> 01:13:29.691
And this little piggy had none.

01:13:31.802 --> 01:13:34.507
<i> There's something wrong,
the rogue is in trouble. </i>

01:13:36.466 --> 01:13:37.466
<i> Are you alright? </i>

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:39.750
<i> Are you alright? </i>

01:13:48.045 --> 01:13:49.458
<i> I'm at the Bioware haven ... </i>

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:52.925
<i> but I can't get through its defenses 
unless she kills those processes. </i>

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:55.463
<i> I can't tell what's going on. </i>

01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:57.502
<i> Her readings are really low. </i>

01:13:58.277 --> 01:14:00.642
<i> Security tities spiking 
all over the place. </i>

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:09.533
You know how this ends.

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:43.728
<i> There is a force field protecting the Bioware. </i>

01:14:46.163 --> 01:14:47.301
<i> There you are. </i>

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:02.449
Oh, no!

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:04.413
COMMUNICATIONS TERMINATED
-- Kaida!

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:32.700
Oh, my God!

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.519
<i> Murder ... </i>

01:15:58.422 --> 01:16:01.032
<i> It makes me feel so human. </i>

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.732
Let's see what you're made of.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.250
You owe me, bitch!

01:17:01.769 --> 01:17:02.933
Trouble catching a breath?

01:17:06.207 --> 01:17:07.461
Now you know how it feels.

01:17:19.645 --> 01:17:24.427
<i> I'm a bit of you. </i>

01:17:30.686 --> 01:17:31.822
<i> No. </i>

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:43.966
<i> No!
It's not fair! </i>

01:18:20.176 --> 01:18:21.428
<i> Flatline scan. </i>

01:18:32.056 --> 01:18:37.350
REBOOTING

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:56.688
Initiate emergency call.

<b> 10 years later </b>

01:19:21.948 --> 01:19:22.948
Sir?

01:19:25.033 --> 01:19:26.062
She's beautiful, isn't she?

01:19:26.063 --> 01:19:27.643
She's a Class 6, Sir.

01:19:29.696 --> 01:19:31.569
Are you ready to take her out?

01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:33.097
Whenever you are.

01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:35.348
What passengers do we have?

01:19:35.349 --> 01:19:39.080
1200 of the richest most privileged
sons of bitches that have ever lived.

01:19:40.237 --> 01:19:41.777
We'd better not keep them waiting then.

01:19:42.661 --> 01:19:45.273
Amphitrite, open her up, please.

01:19:45.274 --> 01:19:47.559
