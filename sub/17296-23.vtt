Mmm, mmm, mmm!
That smells good.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.830
What's wrong, bro?
You want some pizzas?

00:29.897 --> 00:31.732
All you gotsta do is ask.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.236
Oh! May I have
the pizza slice?

00:35.303 --> 00:37.838
Why of course, Starfire.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.889
Why is he the weeping?

00:55.956 --> 00:57.991
Cyborg can't talk 'cause I
caught him in a jinx...

00:58.058 --> 01:00.128
Ha! You said it!
You said my name!

01:00.194 --> 01:02.496
I'm out of the jinx, baby.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.372
Jinx? Our villainous
friend is here?

01:11.439 --> 01:14.308
Not that Jinx.
We's playing jinx.

01:14.375 --> 01:18.146
You know, the game when's two people
say the same thing at the same time,

01:18.212 --> 01:20.013
- and one person yells...
- Jinx!

01:20.080 --> 01:22.616
Jinx.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.486
Then the other person can't talk
till someone says their name.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.388
I see.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.191
But what prevents the person from talking
before being released from the jinx?

01:30.258 --> 01:31.892
Consequences, girl.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.694
Consequences?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.363
Con... sequences.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.331
It's a very serious game.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.167
Yo, Ray. We're playing jinx. You in?

01:39.233 --> 01:40.968
- No.
- Jinx. Gotcha!

01:41.034 --> 01:42.770
Two for two, baby! Whoo!

01:44.071 --> 01:45.573
I too wish to play.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.741
- May I?
- Of course you can.

01:47.808 --> 01:48.809
- Joy!
- Jinx!

01:48.876 --> 01:51.011
Three for three!
Hat trick!

01:51.078 --> 01:52.946
What's going on here?

01:53.013 --> 01:55.883
I just jinxed Beast Boy, Raven and
Starfire like it was nothing. Boom!

01:55.949 --> 01:58.719
You do realize that
you just said their names.

01:58.786 --> 01:59.853
What? Aw!

01:59.920 --> 02:02.856
Oh! You win some,
you loses some, bro.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.325
That was the fun.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.228
Oh, Robin, join us
in the game of jinx.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.863
Sorry, Star,
but I cannot be jinxed.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.866
Since I rely upon my voice
to command this team,

02:12.933 --> 02:16.870
I would never allow myself to fall
prey to any primitive word traps.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.339
Thus, I am jinx-proof!

02:18.406 --> 02:19.873
And it's lucky for you I am

02:19.940 --> 02:22.610
because today,
I have prepared a lecture

02:22.676 --> 02:24.378
on combating high cholesterol.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.348
And it could slightly
prolong your life.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.217
Oh, not again. More lectures?

02:29.283 --> 02:30.484
Quiet down!

02:30.551 --> 02:31.885
I have got a lot of
good information

02:31.952 --> 02:34.588
about the difference
between LDL and HDL.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.458
But your voice is like
the hammer to the skull.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.460
Can't you find another way
to communicate, dude?

02:39.527 --> 02:42.996
Oh, you don't like my method
of communication, huh?

02:43.063 --> 02:46.234
Well, too bad!
This is the best way to communicate.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.702
Loud words and lots of them!

02:48.769 --> 02:51.939
Now, back to the lecture at hand.
LDL and HDL...

02:52.005 --> 02:54.107
Is there no way to shut the mouth?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.743
We could try and jinx him.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.811
But how's we supposed to know
what he's going to say next?

02:57.878 --> 03:01.148
Yeah, it's all boring garbage
until he says, "Titans, go!"

03:01.215 --> 03:02.783
Be right back.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.726
Crime alert.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.595
We'll get into the nitty-gritty
of triglycerides later...

03:14.662 --> 03:15.729
Titans, go!

03:15.796 --> 03:16.864
Jinx!

03:18.131 --> 03:21.535
Oh, what? You got jinxed, son!

03:21.602 --> 03:24.438
Uh-uh! No of the speaking.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.240
You're in the jinx.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.243
Remember, you do not want to
break the jinx because of the...

03:29.310 --> 03:30.544
Consequences.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.414
Consequences.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.317
What's that now?

03:36.384 --> 03:38.218
You want us to say your name?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.053
Okay.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.656
Ra... leigh is the capital
of North Carolina.

03:43.857 --> 03:47.728
Ro... bbers are not
welcome in the Tower.

03:48.996 --> 03:52.266
Ro... binson Crusoe
is a classic novel.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.503
What are you saying? I don't understand.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.571
Yo! I thinks I know
what he saying.

03:57.638 --> 04:01.709
Check it. Titans, today I am
going to use blah, blah, blahs

04:01.775 --> 04:04.812
to teach you the importance
of blah, blah, blah.

04:04.878 --> 04:08.015
Hey! Don't forget about them consequences.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.953
I don't care about consequences!

04:14.221 --> 04:16.857
You broke the jinx.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.993
So?
What's worse that can happen?

04:20.060 --> 04:22.262
Ooh, are you going
to punch me in the shoulder?

04:22.330 --> 04:25.333
Oh, no! Am I going
to owe you a soda?

04:25.399 --> 04:26.967
No, dude!

04:27.034 --> 04:28.902
Consequences.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.705
Consequences.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.174
Stop saying "consequence"...

04:58.432 --> 05:01.134
He's voice is gone, yo!

05:01.201 --> 05:02.803
Told you. Consequences.

05:02.870 --> 05:06.440
Has friend Robin forever lost his
ability to vocalize the sounds?

05:06.507 --> 05:10.511
Yes, and even if we say his name
now, he won't get his voice back.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.918
This is the best day of my life!

05:19.086 --> 05:22.255
I am loving this.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.991
No more boring speeches.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.826
None of the shoutings.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.862
Oh, hey, I think he's trying to say something.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.998
Well, too bads he can't.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.100
He should have
respected the jinx.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.836
Guess he'll have to find
some other way to communicate.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.284
Ah! He's a maniac!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.954
The manic!
On the poolside floor!

05:54.021 --> 05:56.624
I have never seens him
dance this way before.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.098
This is causing the cringiness.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.404
Why are you doing this, man?
It's embarrassing for everyone.

06:10.471 --> 06:15.175
Hold up, yo! I thinks he's trying
to communicate like them bees do.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.544
They talks by dancing.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.746
Friend Robin believes
he is the bee?

06:18.812 --> 06:21.048
He's not a bee.
He knows that, right?

06:23.817 --> 06:26.587
We gots no idea
what you want, fool!

06:26.654 --> 06:27.955
You're just not
a very good dancer.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.429
Ugh! What's he doing now?

06:35.496 --> 06:39.867
I think he's trying to communicate
using the international language

06:39.933 --> 06:41.435
of love.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.872
I am the afraid he is not the
fluent in the love language.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.340
Ew!

06:52.546 --> 06:54.882
Yo! Who invited
Don Juan DeMarco?

06:54.948 --> 06:57.017
Robin broke the jinx, now he is
living with the consequences.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.352
Oh, snap!
I wish I could help you out.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.456
But it's not like I can live inside
your belly and talk for you.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.096
Did you just eat Birdarang?

07:09.162 --> 07:12.199
Word! It is straight up
disgusting in here.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.634
Poor little birdman.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.803
Does this not defeat
the purpose of learning

07:15.869 --> 07:17.671
the alternate
communication method?

07:17.738 --> 07:20.841
Forget that noise. We gotsta
posse up and get my dude's voice back

07:20.908 --> 07:22.710
before he eats anymore fish.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.778
We are we going to peep
my man's vocals, yo?

07:24.845 --> 07:28.215
You lost it playing jinx,
so obviously Jinx has it.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.117
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.819
That's dumb.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.186
- Yeah. Super dumb.
- I cannot believe how dumb this is.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.421
Completely the uncreative.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.023
But I guess
it makes sense, ya'll.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.458
- It is the genius.
- That's why we're number one.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.494
Titians! Giggity, giggity go!

07:46.534 --> 07:48.135
Let's get
this party popppin', yo!

08:13.226 --> 08:14.394
Titans!

08:14.461 --> 08:15.729
Ah! Hey, Cy.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.765
Hey, babe.
Is this your voice collection?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.600
Yeah. It's hobby.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.203
Ouch! Okay, okay.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.039
Listen up, yo. My man
Robin needs his parts back.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.340
He broke the jinx.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.176
He knew there were consequences.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.211
Come on! Hook a brother up.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.546
No way, Jose!

08:39.820 --> 08:41.722
Whoa! That was
a close one, bro!

08:43.991 --> 08:45.025
Ouch!

08:45.092 --> 08:47.160
I'm out this piece.
Later, fellows.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.863
Uh, what do we do, bro?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.967
What are you trying to say?

08:55.135 --> 08:58.639
Aw!
Can't lead your team?

08:58.706 --> 09:02.342
Too bad you've only taught them to
respect yelling. That and violence.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.178
- Ow!
- Ow!

09:05.245 --> 09:06.246
- Ow!
- Ow!

09:06.313 --> 09:07.648
- Okay, loud and clear.
- So inspiring.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.916
You got it, bro.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.889
Sorry.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.830
Woo-hoo!
- Yay!

09:25.165 --> 09:27.300
So, got any plans
for Friday night?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.803
We were thinking
the girls' night out five?

09:47.988 --> 09:51.224
Okay, okay.
He can have his voice back.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.308
Yes! My voice!

10:08.375 --> 10:11.044
♪ I've got my voice back
I've got my voice back ♪

10:11.111 --> 10:13.213
♪ My voice! ♪
Ha-ha!

10:13.280 --> 10:15.082
My voice!

10:15.148 --> 10:17.785
Well, Titans,
I've learned something today.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.688
I don't need my voice when I
can command you with violence!

10:20.754 --> 10:22.622
And I hope
you've learned something too.

10:22.690 --> 10:26.827
That you can't do one single thing
around here without my leadership!

10:26.894 --> 10:28.829
Without me you'd be lost,

10:28.896 --> 10:30.297
wandering the streets
like fools,

10:30.363 --> 10:32.666
gibbering at the moon...

10:32.733 --> 10:34.501
Wearing hats
made out of newspapers...

10:36.169 --> 10:37.805
Crime alert.
We'll continue this discussion later.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.306
But for now...

10:39.372 --> 10:40.573
Titans, go!

10:40.640 --> 10:41.909
Jinx!
