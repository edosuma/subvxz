02:32.158 --> 02:34.926
>> that's the stuff i started
with.

02:35.061 --> 02:36.461
I was a 9-year-old sipping
ac/dc.

02:36.596 --> 02:40.832
Before "the voice" i had been in
a band for six years.

02:40.967 --> 02:44.369
I would go do a gig.
Why are you afraid?

02:44.504 --> 02:48.173
Because i'm out playing music
¶ the gig is up, the news is

02:48.307 --> 02:51.810
Out, they finally found me ¶
>> it's hard to believe i'm in

02:51.944 --> 02:54.513
The top 12 because i should be
in class right now doing english

02:54.647 --> 02:57.983
Homework.
>> coming out doing a rock song

02:58.117 --> 03:01.019
You have to command the stage.

confidence.

03:02.188 --> 03:04.356

approval on stage.

You're looking to command
everyone.

03:08.561 --> 03:11.196
You're a rock star.
That's the attitude you need to

03:11.330 --> 03:13.765
Have.
Right from the very start i want

03:13.900 --> 03:17.069
People to go like, whoa.
I want to be able to trust you

03:17.203 --> 03:20.439
But i want you to prove to me
today that you can do that.

03:20.573 --> 03:24.743
When you're 15 years old you're
still learning yourself, but you

03:24.877 --> 03:26.344
Can't learn how to sometime like
he has.

03:26.479 --> 03:30.482

Wow, you were 9 when you were in
a band.

06:42.642 --> 06:46.778
That's so bad ass.
>> you know what, i was that kid

06:46.912 --> 06:49.814
When you play in a bar, i was
that kid jumping up on t bar

06:49.949 --> 06:51.783
And dancing around on the bar
sipping ac/dc.

06:51.917 --> 06:55.387

Let me tell you something, man.
This kid can do anything.

07:30.723 --> 07:36.928
We've seen him do all kinds --
almost every style you can do.

07:37.063 --> 07:40.198
Man, you need to do a country
song.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.968
>> carson: Pharrell?
>> braiden, just before you went

07:44.103 --> 07:47.605
On.
It's need to hear you sing.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.441
Your own interpretation was so
cool.

07:49.575 --> 07:53.144
You're out here sipping this
rock record, you're infusing all

07:53.279 --> 07:55.413
Of these cool runs in the middle
of the song.

07:55.548 --> 07:57.816
Who's this guy?
He's hitting the notes and not

07:57.950 --> 08:01.019
Missing them.
I'm super impressed.

08:01.153 --> 08:03.755
I don't know if it's just that
you're 15 years old or that

08:03.889 --> 08:07.926
You've been in a band that long
or that you can do any song.

08:08.060 --> 08:11.329
I think blake is right.
>> jumping on the bar.

08:11.464 --> 08:13.932

Rock song.
He really was really confident

08:21.574 --> 08:25.477
About it and i was scared but
vocally you just nailed it.

08:25.611 --> 08:28.580

incredible and i just feel just

For you there were things i felt
hadn't been done that could

10:13.118 --> 10:16.254
Elevate your game.
This is kind of a curveball.

10:16.388 --> 10:17.522
>> i never would have thought of
this song.

10:17.656 --> 10:22.894

10:28.567 --> 10:33.238
Does.
She has a jazzy edge.

10:33.372 --> 10:38.176
If she applies the melodic
changes, i think those can be

10:38.310 --> 10:41.880
Applied to drake's rhythms.
>> sing it your way, have 100%

10:42.014 --> 10:45.450
Confidence in it.
¶ call me on the cell phone ¶

10:45.584 --> 10:52.223

To be all about you.
So you're not going to rely on

11:37.836 --> 11:42.240
The band to do it for you.
Let yourself go too far.

11:42.374 --> 11:44.576
Let yourself bubble over with
emotion.

break through on that stage.

blake shelton, let's start with

14:28.273 --> 14:32.076
You, sir.
>> i don't think there's ever

14:32.211 --> 14:39.117
Been a more elegant and classy
performance of a song about a

14:39.251 --> 14:42.019
Bootie call in the history of
music.

14:42.154 --> 14:45.123
I mean, that was unbelievable.
I hear that song on the radio

14:45.257 --> 14:47.558
Every day.
>> you've heard that song?

14:47.693 --> 14:49.527
>> that song's so big even i
have heard it.

14:49.661 --> 14:56.501
>> wow.
That's shocking.

14:56.635 --> 15:02.373

15:02.508 --> 15:05.743

Thank you, blake.

15:05.878 --> 15:13.184
Let's move along to pharrell if
we can.

Pharrell?
>> wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:18.690 --> 15:20.258
Wait.
Okay.

15:20.392 --> 15:24.996
This is your moment.
This is your moment.

15:25.130 --> 15:29.133
>> thank you, pharrell.
>> wow.

15:29.268 --> 15:33.571
Yes.
Yes.

15:33.705 --> 15:38.075
Amy, you always make songs
yours, and it's really -- it's

15:38.210 --> 15:40.711
An amazing, uncanny ability that
not many people have, but i'm

15:40.846 --> 15:43.681
Happy for you.
The reason why i pushed my

15:43.816 --> 15:46.784
Button for you in the beginning.
It's the reason i'm happy you're

15:46.919 --> 15:49.854
Now with adam.
You know, the idea that you

15:49.988 --> 15:52.590
Could come out here and take
such creative license and bring

15:52.724 --> 15:56.761
So much of you.
All of that brooklyn, new york,

15:56.895 --> 16:01.065
Jazz element to that song and
that way is a beautiful thing

16:01.200 --> 16:03.100
And it's why we like doing this
show, to provide opportunities

16:03.235 --> 16:04.669
Like that.
Thank you.

16:04.803 --> 16:09.006
>> thank you, coach.
Let's slide over to gwen.

16:09.141 --> 16:14.011
Gwen?
>> you seriously look so pretty

16:14.146 --> 16:16.848
Right now, i can't even believe
it.

16:16.982 --> 16:19.217
That was so cool as well, adam.
Amazing idea.

16:19.351 --> 16:23.287
Definitely better than the
version that we did on fallen

16:23.422 --> 16:26.490
For sure, 100%.
I think you're an amazing

16:26.625 --> 16:28.659
Artist.
I love watching you sing.

16:28.794 --> 16:32.797
I love your style, your voice,
just how tender you sing so i

16:32.931 --> 16:36.300

16:36.435 --> 16:41.172
>> carson: Amy, let's talk to
your coach, adam.

16:41.306 --> 16:43.341
>> amy, i think that you made a
really brave choice.

16:43.475 --> 16:46.143
I know that it was a weird
choice.

16:46.278 --> 16:54.886
I think what's really cool is
it's kind of the antithesis.

16:55.020 --> 16:57.355
You did something bold.
I want that version.

16:57.489 --> 16:59.957
I want that version of that song
in my life.

17:00.092 --> 17:03.227
That doesn't exist until now.
You've created an entirely new

17:03.362 --> 17:07.397
Spin and version of the song.
You should be so proud of the

17:07.531 --> 17:09.467
Artistry involved in that.
>> carson: If you want amy in

17:09.601 --> 17:11.102

18:17.402 --> 18:19.303
I am so excited to still be
here.

18:19.438 --> 18:22.606
You know, back in chicago i work
as an actor.

18:22.741 --> 18:26.277
Like i have to put music on the
back burner, but being here, it

18:26.411 --> 18:30.781
Has shown me that music is what
i'm supposed to be doing.

18:30.916 --> 18:34.285
I need to show pharrell he did
not waste a save on me

18:34.419 --> 18:38.089
¶ take a look at me now ¶
>> i go out on stage every week.

18:38.223 --> 18:40.324
It's time to do something
different.

18:40.459 --> 18:42.860
People should see that side of
me

18:42.995 --> 18:48.399
¶ take a good look at me now ¶
>> i would love to hear you sing

18:48.533 --> 18:56.173
It a bit more stripped down.
This is like an english hymn.

18:56.308 --> 18:59.377
When he's saying take a look at
me now he's bearing his heart to

18:59.511 --> 19:03.080
Her.
You can't put too much on top of

19:03.215 --> 19:10.287
It.
Mark's strength is what he

19:10.422 --> 19:15.493
Feels.
>> i've grown and you become

19:15.627 --> 19:18.396
Family with everybody here.
Team pharrell, it's like a

19:18.530 --> 19:23.367
Family.
I couldn't be more grateful than

19:23.502 --> 19:26.904
Studying all night and making
records and connecting him and

19:27.039 --> 19:29.940
Watching him life.
>> your creative passion is your

19:30.075 --> 19:32.076
Heart.
That's what you feel with.

19:32.210 --> 19:36.347
Sing with your heart and you'll
be fine.

19:36.481 --> 19:38.482
>> i'm on it.
 My faith and pharrell has done

19:38.617 --> 19:39.583
That for me.

Me.

22:43.235 --> 22:45.769
Side of you tonight.
Just a more calmer, sensitive

22:45.904 --> 22:50.908
Side, you know?
What i love about you is you

22:51.042 --> 22:53.811
Just really -- you're so cool to
heart and spirit.

22:53.945 --> 22:55.579

You want this badly.
Like you can really feel that.

23:16.868 --> 23:20.037
Like you almost want this more
than anybody, and that passion

23:20.171 --> 23:24.275
And that determination to me is
what's the most -- you have a

23:24.409 --> 23:26.477
Great voice but that's what's
the most inspiring to me about

23:26.611 --> 23:30.581
What you do.
You get out there and you give

23:30.715 --> 23:32.116
200% every single time.
That is not something that can

23:32.250 --> 23:35.853

you're cute.

30:05.877 --> 30:12.716

It was one of those things --
>> shut up.

30:31.035 --> 30:34.071
>> you were just taken away from
the competition.

30:34.205 --> 30:36.506

Before our eyes.
She's ready to go.

30:39.644 --> 30:41.945

when you're on stage now.

31:04.168 --> 31:07.437
Like they're saying, it's like
you graduated now.

31:07.572 --> 31:09.873

treating this like it's your

31:10.007 --> 31:16.446

I had a hard time in high

Connection with you.
I feel like you're a real

32:42.633 --> 32:45.969
Artist.
You're quirky and original but

What we're trying to do is show
different sides of you and have

Cool about her.
On the bridge --

super indie and small and then

>> carson: Korin bukowski,

36:02.400 --> 36:13.376
Trying to make it to the top 11
on tonight's show.

36:13.511 --> 36:16.980
Your coach looks very excited.
The family's in the house.

36:17.114 --> 36:21.751
Let's start with coach blake.
>> you know what, korin,

36:21.886 --> 36:26.656
Don't -- i don't know how to say
this because i don't want to

36:26.791 --> 36:29.359
Change anything about you, but
please keep thinking that --

36:29.493 --> 36:32.162
Keep thinking that you're not
cool because she's right, that

36:32.296 --> 36:35.665
Is what's so cool about you.
I mean, the fact that you're so

36:35.800 --> 36:38.501
Unassuming about yourself and
the fact that you get up there

36:38.636 --> 36:43.773
And you do what you do.
That's got to be one of the

36:43.908 --> 36:46.876
Hardest songs that i've ever
heard, i mean, to sing.

36:47.011 --> 36:51.414
The range on it, you nail it.
Cool hair, by the way.

36:51.549 --> 36:52.415
>> carson: Thanks, blake.
Pharrell.

36:52.550 --> 36:54.317
>> hi.
>> hi.

36:54.452 --> 36:57.153
>> how did that feel just now?
>> i don't even know.

36:57.288 --> 36:58.755
I feel like i'm in another place
right now.

36:58.889 --> 37:00.490
>> yeah?
>> yeah.

37:00.624 --> 37:03.660
>> that's what it's supposed to
be.

37:03.794 --> 37:06.162
It's supposed to feel
transformational, listening to

37:06.297 --> 37:09.099
Your testimony earlier about,
you know, your connection to the

37:09.233 --> 37:12.268
Song and what it meant.
It was really cool to see you

37:12.403 --> 37:17.240
Get out there and just sort of
live that moment for yourself

37:17.374 --> 37:20.977
And, you know, like blake said.
Continue to assume that you're

37:21.112 --> 37:24.380
Not cool because every time you
come out here you do that over

37:24.515 --> 37:27.784
And over and over again, which
is have a great time.

37:27.918 --> 37:30.553
That's what this is all about.
>> thank you.

37:30.688 --> 37:33.823
>> carson: And gwen stefani.
>> i feel like -- i feel so

37:33.958 --> 37:37.527
Blessed to be part of your
journey, you know what i mean,

37:37.661 --> 37:39.529
With you, watching you
transform, watching you gain

37:39.663 --> 37:43.967
Confidence.
I feel like that song was -- it

37:44.101 --> 37:47.137
Was like written for your life.
To watch you come out there and

37:47.271 --> 37:49.472
Do it the way you did it
tonight.

37:49.607 --> 37:52.475
You did it exactly how i
envisioned it to be done.

37:52.610 --> 37:56.379
Like so cool.
Like beyond cool and then at the

37:56.514 --> 37:59.849
End to just like nail those
vocals and just show everybody

37:59.984 --> 38:03.720
Your range and how incredible
you are and how you trusted me

38:03.854 --> 38:09.459
To like just go blond.
Why not?

Arkansas family man who's
putting his country spin on a

38:55.306 --> 39:02.879
Rock ballad.
Here's more from barrett baber.

39:03.013 --> 39:07.684
>> earlier this year i was a guy
living in arkansas teaching at a

39:07.818 --> 39:11.254
High school and then just in a
few short months i found myself

39:11.388 --> 39:14.090
On the cusp of something am
amazing.

39:14.225 --> 39:17.860
There's a lot of potential for
this to be a country soul

39:17.995 --> 39:21.397
Single.
>> sure.

39:21.532 --> 39:24.901
¶ she's a part day after day
¶

39:25.035 --> 39:26.703
>> be sure that we hear the word
oceans.

39:26.837 --> 39:30.540
Especially with something like
this so broken down, so sparse.

39:30.674 --> 39:34.477
There's not much you can hide
behind.

39:34.612 --> 39:35.511
>> no need to conjure it up
vocally.

39:35.646 --> 39:38.348
>> man, i don't think so.
When you open your mouth, it's

39:38.482 --> 39:40.917
Country.
I feel like the one thing we

39:41.051 --> 39:42.952
Haven't seen you do is just
this.

39:43.087 --> 39:46.256
He's going to stand in one spot
in front of his microphone.

39:46.390 --> 39:49.158
This is about how he sounds, how
he sells the story.

39:49.293 --> 39:52.061
You bring passion and
soulfulness, the thing we really

39:52.196 --> 39:56.966
Need in country music right now.
This is a guy you're going to

39:57.101 --> 40:00.737
Hear on the radio some day.
I'm thinking this song, i think

40:00.871 --> 40:03.573
Of your family back in arkansas.
It's their song to you almost.

40:03.707 --> 40:05.942
>> of course this one
especially, it really rings

40:06.076 --> 40:08.678
True.
Because this dream that i have

40:08.812 --> 40:12.482
For my life is not just a dream
for my life, it's a dream for

40:12.616 --> 40:15.752
Three other people's lives.
Frankly, they're the ones that

40:15.886 --> 40:18.755
Make the most sacrifices.
 My wife sarah is incredible.

40:18.889 --> 40:20.423
We've been together for ten
years.

40:20.557 --> 40:23.926
She's always said these things
to me, wherever you go, that's

40:24.061 --> 40:27.130
Where i'll be.
That's a pretty awesome support

40:27.264 --> 40:30.366
System to have in place.
>> how about that?

40:30.501 --> 40:33.870
Is it on itunes yet?
>> yes.

40:34.004 --> 40:39.309
>> you didn't get to do that.
>> i'm about to bring the song.

40:39.443 --> 40:40.543

Adam, let's start with you,
buddy.

43:21.538 --> 43:24.907
>> i love it!
I love it how no matter what

43:25.042 --> 43:28.945
Kind of vocal it is, like you
just attack it.

43:29.079 --> 43:32.982
It could be the most sensitive
ballad or the most energetic

43:33.116 --> 43:38.054
Song, you cannot help it.
You have to pull that mic out

43:38.188 --> 43:40.189
And i love that about you, man.
That shows how much

43:40.324 --> 43:42.792
Determination and passion you
have.

43:42.926 --> 43:46.195
I just love watching everything
about you.

43:46.330 --> 43:48.698
>> carson: Coach blake?
>> i love that about you too,

43:48.832 --> 43:51.200
Man.
It's funny.

43:51.335 --> 43:53.202
I was watching our rehearsal
back there.

43:53.337 --> 43:56.239
It was like i was talking to you
about maybe this one time we

43:56.373 --> 43:57.340

Snuck up on me throughout this

Cool to see you in a different
way, you know, because, you

Know, we've seen you with the
hat and your look and all of

50:04.507 --> 50:07.276
That stuff and even though we
know how talented you are, when

50:07.410 --> 50:11.714
You do something like this and
change it up a little bit, it

50:11.848 --> 50:15.751
Makes people focus on you in a
different way again and

50:15.886 --> 50:19.054
Ultimately realize, dang, she's
such a good singer, you know?

50:19.189 --> 50:22.892

bit and all of a sudden it's new

59:51.127 --> 59:54.663
I don't know what my deal is.
>> i'm a very emotional person

59:54.797 --> 59:58.500
As it is but stressing out
sometimes, it just kind of gets

59:58.634 --> 01:00:00.569
All built up and comes out at
the most inconvenient time

01:00:00.703 --> 01:00:03.505
Possible.
>> i used to be so scared to

01:00:03.639 --> 01:00:05.507
Make a mistake that i would make
mistakes.

01:00:05.641 --> 01:00:11.613
I want you to sing this song
like you're a country singer

01:00:11.747 --> 01:00:13.715
That's a force to be reckoned
with that's out there to be

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:16.251
Reckoned with.
>> shelby has unlimited range

01:00:16.385 --> 01:00:19.754
And power.
She can access that through her

01:00:19.889 --> 01:00:26.027
Own confidence, she's going to
be in really good shape.

01:00:26.162 --> 01:00:29.130
>> adam really helped me today.
That just shows me that he cares

01:00:29.265 --> 01:00:30.932
That i'm able to do my best if
my head's clear.

You sounded great.
Congratulations.

[ cheers and applause ]
>> carson: All right.

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:28.309
Let's start with blake shelton.
>> hi, shelby.

01:03:28.444 --> 01:03:31.046
>> hey.
>> you're such a powerful

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.181
Singer.
I mean, there was one moment

01:03:33.315 --> 01:03:37.552
There where you got out ahead of
the band there a little bit, but

01:03:37.687 --> 01:03:43.091
Then you followed up with such a
big -- such a big note that it

01:03:43.225 --> 01:03:46.861
Over comes some of those things.
You know what i'm saying, you're

01:03:46.996 --> 01:03:49.364
Such a powerful singer that i
think you can get by with

01:03:49.498 --> 01:03:52.534
Something like that.
So good job overall.

01:03:52.668 --> 01:03:56.504
>> thanks.
>> carson: Adam.

01:03:56.639 --> 01:03:58.473
>> i'm actually glad -- i'm
actually glad that blake brought

01:03:58.607 --> 01:04:01.676
That up because i was debating
whether or not i was going to.

01:04:01.811 --> 01:04:04.779
You did, you got out a little
bit rhythmically ahead of the

01:04:04.914 --> 01:04:07.716
Band but this is why i love you,
okay.

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:14.089
Not only did you recover, but
you recovered with one of the

01:04:14.223 --> 01:04:16.791
Most powerful notes you've ever
sang in your life.

01:04:16.926 --> 01:04:20.061
This girl is here to play, this
girl can win and as your coach

01:04:20.196 --> 01:04:21.996
Like we always talked about,
it's not about whether you make

01:04:22.131 --> 01:04:25.600
A mistake.
You're going to make mistakes.

01:04:25.735 --> 01:04:27.669
It's how you recover from those
mistakes.

01:04:27.803 --> 01:04:31.473
I don't care about those
mistakes.

01:04:31.607 --> 01:04:33.775
You made a tiny baby one and
then came back with your best

01:04:33.909 --> 01:04:36.544
Moment on the show.
Congratulations.

Paul mirkovich and "the voice"
band.

01:05:22.458 --> 01:05:23.725
Ladies and gentlemen.
Right now, two big back-to-back

01:05:23.859 --> 01:05:24.959
Performances.
First up, it's team pharrell's

01:05:25.094 --> 01:05:26.528
Virginia r&b singer who's taking
on a grammy award-winning hit

01:05:26.662 --> 01:05:36.070
Song.
Here's more from evan mckeel.

01:05:36.205 --> 01:05:38.873
>>> it's so surreal to be in the
top 12.

01:05:39.008 --> 01:05:41.176
I wasn't as comfortable
performing that song as i have

01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:44.345
Been before.
>> your stage presence sometimes

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.781
Feels a little bit too like
thought out.

01:05:46.916 --> 01:05:52.854
>> i definitely went into the
rehearsal still kind of

01:05:52.988 --> 01:05:54.856
Replaying some of the
unshurdness.

01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:57.158
So i'm glad america voted me
through.

01:05:57.293 --> 01:05:59.394
I don't want to go back to my
weddings and bar gigs and stuff,

01:05:59.528 --> 01:06:03.731
You know?
>> i don't think that's in the

01:06:03.866 --> 01:06:06.668
Cards for you anyway.
Started out doing rock songs,

01:06:06.802 --> 01:06:15.009
But when he started to sing
other songs that displayed a

01:06:15.144 --> 01:06:18.146
Little bit more of the
soulfulness, he shined

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.382
¶ this is it ¶
>> just getting any thoughts out

01:06:21.517 --> 01:06:23.952
Of my head and just being me.
>> you think you're going to use

01:06:24.086 --> 01:06:26.087
The stand?
>> no.

01:06:26.222 --> 01:06:29.057
I just want to move around the
stage and to shake.

01:06:29.191 --> 01:06:31.392
>> we want whatever is going to
produce a natural sounding

01:06:31.527 --> 01:06:33.461
Performance.
If you've got to shake, you've

01:06:33.596 --> 01:06:36.631
Got to shake.
If you've got to dance, you've

01:06:36.765 --> 01:06:40.635
Got to dance, but don't think
about it.

01:06:40.769 --> 01:06:42.971
>> it's amazing to look at where
i am now in the top 12 and doing

01:06:43.105 --> 01:06:47.075
What i'm doing.
>> how's it going?

01:06:47.209 --> 01:06:50.545
>> crazy day.
I had my rehearsal with the

01:06:50.679 --> 01:06:51.546
Band.
>> are you happy?

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.883
>> i'm very happy.
>> he's emotionally connecting.

01:06:55.017 --> 01:06:57.151
When he starts to sing you
realize how much he feels on the

01:06:57.286 --> 01:07:01.155
Inside.
>> for me, the song "this is it"

01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:03.992
It's about looking at where you
are and what's right in front of

01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:06.928
You.
For me, it's this performance.

01:07:07.062 --> 01:07:09.697
I want to get to the top 11.
I have to enjoy the moment and

01:07:09.832 --> 01:07:11.399
Sing my heart out.
>> carson: With "this is it,"

01:07:11.533 --> 01:07:40.128
Here's evan mckeel.3 f2
evan mckeel

01:07:45.868 --> 01:07:53.474
You're waiting here
one good reason to try ¶

01:07:53.609 --> 01:08:01.249
¶ but, what more can i say?
What's left to provide?

01:08:01.383 --> 01:08:06.421
You think that
maybe it's over ¶

01:08:06.555 --> 01:08:10.058
¶ only if you
want it to be ¶

01:08:10.192 --> 01:08:14.195
¶ are you gonna wait
for a sign

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:19.500
Your miracle? ¶
¶ stand up and fight

01:08:19.635 --> 01:08:21.536
This is it ¶
¶ make no mistake

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:26.140
Where you are
this is it ¶

01:08:26.274 --> 01:08:38.618
¶ your back's
to the corner

01:08:38.754 --> 01:08:40.188
This is it ¶
¶ no one can tell

01:08:40.322 --> 01:08:44.359
What the future holds
oh-oh-oh-oh ¶

01:08:44.493 --> 01:08:56.470
¶ who makes the
choice of how it goes

01:08:56.604 --> 01:09:01.142
¶ there comes a day in every
life ¶

01:09:01.276 --> 01:09:02.210
Make no mistake
where you are ¶

01:09:02.344 --> 01:09:03.778
¶ this is it
you're goin'

01:09:03.912 --> 01:09:05.912
No further ¶
¶ this is it

01:09:06.048 --> 01:09:07.415
Until it's
over and done ¶

01:09:07.549 --> 01:09:18.292
¶ this is it
one way or another ¶

01:09:18.426 --> 01:09:29.636
¶ this is it
this is it ¶

01:09:29.772 --> 01:09:35.376
[ cheers and applause ]
>> carson: Evan mckeel,

01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:39.613
Team pharrell.
Good job.

01:09:39.747 --> 01:09:48.555

About you tonight.
Like i feel like you really

Showed us who you are.
You just went for it in such a

01:09:57.066 --> 01:10:03.304
Big way.
I found myself, i was like, wow!

01:10:03.439 --> 01:10:04.205
Wow!
Like three times out loud

01:10:04.339 --> 01:10:05.506
Tonight.
Hon

01:10:05.641 --> 01:10:14.449
Honestly.
It was so good and your voice

01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:17.552
And that song and -- it was
really good.

01:10:17.686 --> 01:10:20.555
>> wow.
>> carson: Coach pharrell.

01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:24.158
>> how did you feel?
>> i had so much fun.

01:10:24.293 --> 01:10:27.295
>> awesome.
It just goes to show you, it

01:10:27.429 --> 01:10:33.034
Just goes to show you that when
you stick with who you are and

01:10:33.168 --> 01:10:35.603
You share that with the world,
it lifts people, man, when they

01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:38.539
Really believe it.
When they really can see that

01:10:38.674 --> 01:10:41.075
You mean what you're saying and
you're singing everything from

01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:42.743
Your heart.
Like people feel that.

01:10:42.878 --> 01:10:48.249
Don't you guys feel that?
[ cheers and applause ]

01:10:50.486 --> 01:10:53.855
You earned it and, you know, i

01:10:53.989 --> 01:10:55.456
Because you deserve it, man.
You went out there with your

01:10:55.591 --> 01:10:58.493
Heart tonight.
You deserve it.

01:10:58.627 --> 01:10:59.894

And by downloading evan's song
on itunes.

01:11:02.564 --> 01:11:07.702
We've got another performance
right away.

01:11:07.836 --> 01:11:11.339
But first, give it up for evan
mckeel.

01:11:11.473 --> 01:11:12.773
Continuing now with team adam's
unique pop singer with a

01:11:12.908 --> 01:11:19.313
Spiritual song choice.
Here's more from jordan smith.

01:11:19.448 --> 01:11:24.585
>> before all of this i was just
a kid in harland, kentucky.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.688
A year ago i was trying to make
money so i could finish college.

01:11:27.823 --> 01:11:29.524
>> you had a pretty good week.
>> yeah.

01:11:29.658 --> 01:11:32.894
>> when i think back to the
first day when i auditioned, i

01:11:33.028 --> 01:11:35.796
Never would have imagined it
would have changed my life as

01:11:35.931 --> 01:11:38.266
Much.
>> highest charting artist on

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.434
Itunes.
>> that's crazy.

01:11:40.569 --> 01:11:45.706
>> for everyone to want more of
what i did was incredible.

01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:48.176
>> my favorite thing is you have
"halo" by beyonce and you have

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:51.679
This tune.
You want to create a new moment.

01:11:51.813 --> 01:11:55.583
¶
>> this entire song is about the

01:11:55.717 --> 01:12:00.288
Faithfulness of god.
 My memory of growing up and

01:12:00.422 --> 01:12:01.956
Singing in church with my
family.

01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:05.226
I became a part of my college
choir and we sang for sunday

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:09.564
Mass in the vatican.
None of this would be possible

01:12:09.698 --> 01:12:12.433
In your own strength.
God provides, sorry.

01:12:12.568 --> 01:12:15.703
He's like, i'm going to do
everything for you, all you have

01:12:15.837 --> 01:12:22.843
To do is wake up every morning
and be who you are.

01:12:22.978 --> 01:12:28.950
>> it's hard to explain how you
feel when you hear jordan sing.

01:12:29.084 --> 01:12:31.619
Stevie wonder i naelt from.
Whitney houston.

01:12:31.753 --> 01:12:33.854
Because it's so intimate,
beautiful.

01:12:33.989 --> 01:12:35.122
I love the way you play and
sing.

01:12:35.257 --> 01:12:38.426
I don't think the band should be
playing on this.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.631
I think it should be you dressed
in a black suit.

01:12:43.765 --> 01:12:47.201
All we need is your conviction
and belief and what you do.

01:12:47.336 --> 01:12:50.705
>> we're going vulnerable.
We have to take risks.

01:12:50.839 --> 01:12:55.309
>> you're great.
>> this performance is a chance

01:12:55.444 --> 01:12:56.944
For me to show who i am.

>> carson: Tissues out.
Audience engaged, obviously.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:01.829
Coaches are up.
Let's get some comments.

01:16:01.963 --> 01:16:04.432
That was a special song from you
what we saw, singing at the

01:16:04.566 --> 01:16:06.467
Vatican.
We'll hear from adam in a

01:16:06.601 --> 01:16:08.803
Minute.
Blake shelton, let's start with

01:16:08.937 --> 01:16:14.108
You.
>> man, jordan, you know, coming

01:16:14.242 --> 01:16:18.312
Off the weekend and the horrible
things that happened over in

01:16:18.447 --> 01:16:23.684
Paris and just kind of having a
heavy heart the last few days,

01:16:23.819 --> 01:16:30.424
Thank you for that.
That was beautiful, man.

01:16:30.559 --> 01:16:33.861
[ applause ]
>> carson: Pharrell.

01:16:33.995 --> 01:16:37.064
>> dude, you had me standing up
in the middle of the song.

01:16:37.199 --> 01:16:39.733
I just have to -- i'll keep it
very brief.

01:16:39.868 --> 01:16:42.403
I think everybody needs to go to
itunes right now.

01:16:42.537 --> 01:16:45.005
I don't care about the vote.
Go to itunes right now and buy

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:49.109
This song from this guy right
now!

01:16:49.244 --> 01:16:51.512
That's it.
>> carson: You can do that at

01:16:51.646 --> 01:16:56.650
The end of the show.
Excellent reminder.

01:16:56.785 --> 01:17:00.287
Let's go to your coach, adam.
>> you know, blake took the

01:17:00.422 --> 01:17:02.890
Words right out of my mouth.
You know, sometimes there's so

01:17:03.024 --> 01:17:06.994
Much about the world that can be
so confusing and so sad.

01:17:07.128 --> 01:17:13.033
And then you come along and make
us all feel like there's a lot

01:17:13.168 --> 01:17:16.637
Of hope and there's just 2 1/2
minutes we listen to this guy

01:17:16.771 --> 01:17:20.774
Singing, all of a sudden you
just feel the sense of

01:17:20.909 --> 01:17:24.378
Rejuvenation and joy that for a
moment you don't think you're

01:17:24.513 --> 01:17:26.146
Going to get to feel again.
Whew.

01:17:26.281 --> 01:17:29.550
Just i thank you as well.
Thank you, jordan.

01:17:29.684 --> 01:17:30.951
>> carson: If you want jordan in
the top 11, you can vote on

01:17:31.086 --> 01:17:32.653
Nbc.Com, "the voice" facebook
page, the official "voice" app

01:17:32.787 --> 01:17:37.658
And by downloading jordan's song
on itunes.

01:17:37.792 --> 01:17:42.329
Give it up for jordan smith.
[ cheers and applause ]

01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:45.432
>> carson: When we come back,
elvis is in the building.

01:17:45.567 --> 01:17:56.810

01:18:00.582 --> 01:18:05.920
One more artists will perform,

For voting.
Closing out the night is team

01:18:11.092 --> 01:18:13.394
Blake's georgia teen who's
taking on a number one country

01:18:13.528 --> 01:18:20.401
Love song.
Here's more from zach seabaugh.

01:18:20.535 --> 01:18:21.969
>> it's super awesome and i'm so
excited.

01:18:22.103 --> 01:18:25.072
>> congratulations, dude.
You did it, man.

01:18:25.206 --> 01:18:26.907
>> that's crazy.
I left everything out on the

01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:30.177
Table.
¶ i love it when she calls me

01:18:30.312 --> 01:18:31.545
Buttercup
¶

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.380
>> do you consider yourself a
dancer?

01:18:33.515 --> 01:18:36.383
>> i started doing theater when
i was younger.

01:18:36.518 --> 01:18:40.487
>> what did you do?
Do you remember any of it?

01:18:40.622 --> 01:18:45.993
>> if you sing, i'll act it out.
>> okay.

01:18:46.127 --> 01:18:48.729
¶ i've been working so hard, i'm
parking my car ¶

01:18:48.863 --> 01:18:51.198
>> a few months ago i was the
weird dude that was a singer and

01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:55.436
A dancer.
Not your typical high school

01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:58.606
17-year-old, but now i'm hanging
out with blake shelton every

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.109
Week just getting tips from him.
It's been so cool.

01:19:02.243 --> 01:19:05.946
>> you know it's easy to place
zach in country music right now.

01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:09.116
He's a heartthrob.
He's josh turner, randy travis

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:12.820
Or somebody like that.
As far as being on stage, elvis.

01:19:12.954 --> 01:19:14.888
>> this is a song that's a
forgotten song.

01:19:15.023 --> 01:19:18.792
Like your generation's never
heard it before.

01:19:18.927 --> 01:19:22.229
It's going to be one of those
itunes moments

01:19:22.364 --> 01:19:25.265
¶ your head up in the clouds,
feet off the ground ¶

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.602
¶ my love ¶
>> i think this is a great song

01:19:28.737 --> 01:19:31.939
Choice because we've seen that
wild side of zach and now i

01:19:32.073 --> 01:19:35.609
Think it's time to bring it back
to that romantic side.

01:19:35.744 --> 01:19:38.078
>> you're going to find some
girls out here.

01:19:38.213 --> 01:19:39.313
You're going to be singing to
them.

01:19:39.447 --> 01:19:45.419
Take their hands.
¶ get on your mark, get set ¶

Hoping to come back next week.

Let's get some comments from our

01:22:26.681 --> 01:22:27.848
Mr. Pharrell williams, let's
start with you.

01:22:27.982 --> 01:22:29.483
>> hey, zach.
How are you, man?

01:22:29.617 --> 01:22:34.154
>> good.
>> dude, that range that you

01:22:34.289 --> 01:22:37.457
Have is so crazy and it's like
you sing so low in certain parts

01:22:37.592 --> 01:22:40.460
Of the song and then, you know,
in other places you're about to

01:22:40.595 --> 01:22:42.596
Go for a high note.
I'm like, man, are you going to

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:45.866
Do it?
You totally do it for ease.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.568
While you're reaching down
shaking hands with beautiful

01:22:47.702 --> 01:22:51.271
Girls.
Okay, this guy's a professional.

01:22:51.406 --> 01:22:53.140
And you're 17?
>> yes, sir.

01:22:53.274 --> 01:22:58.412

It goes beyond the show.

>> carson: Thank you, pharrell.
Gwen?

01:23:12.427 --> 01:23:15.362
>> the entire performance i kept
thinking, wait, how old is he?

01:23:15.496 --> 01:23:17.798
You're so natural.
Your stage presence is so --

01:23:17.932 --> 01:23:22.736
It's so like seasoned.
You feel like you have so much

01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:25.405
Confidence on stage and it's so
effortless and natural and i

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.575
Just feel like i'm just
watching -- i'm at some awards

01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:33.413
Show and i'm watching you.
I think you're going to be a

01:23:33.548 --> 01:23:35.515
Huge star.

>> thank you.
>> carson: Thank you, gwen.

01:23:39.921 --> 01:23:41.922
Adam levine, what do you think?
>> last week was a break out

01:23:42.056 --> 01:23:43.857
Thing.
I didn't know you could dance

01:23:43.992 --> 01:23:47.461
Like that.
The ladies were flipping out.

01:23:47.595 --> 01:23:50.464
There was a whole pandemonium
going down here.

01:23:50.598 --> 01:23:51.498
I selfishly want to see more of
that.

01:23:51.633 --> 01:23:54.534
That was the thing.
We're really on to something.

01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:55.502
This was definitely more
subdued.

01:23:55.637 --> 01:23:56.970
This was great.
It was a different side of what

01:23:57.105 --> 01:24:00.874
You do.
It was like the 15th song in

01:24:01.009 --> 01:24:02.643
Like a set and an arena.
You were kind of like doing

01:24:02.777 --> 01:24:05.779
Something different.
I wanted more of the elvisy

01:24:05.914 --> 01:24:08.448
Stuff.
I was pretty blown away.

01:24:08.583 --> 01:24:11.285
I thought it was awesome, dude.
You can't do any wrong.

01:24:11.419 --> 01:24:17.291
>> carson: Thank you, adam.
Your coach, blake.

01:24:17.425 --> 01:24:22.262
>> man, i don't know that i've
ever had anybody on this show

01:24:22.397 --> 01:24:25.866
Like you, that i really feel
like you can walk off this stage

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.736
Right now, out the door, get in
your tour bus and go and be on

01:24:29.871 --> 01:24:33.473
Your headlining tour somewhere,
man.

01:24:33.608 --> 01:24:36.009
You really are like --
>> thank you.

01:24:36.144 --> 01:24:37.210
>> you're ready to do it.
Man.

01:24:37.345 --> 01:24:41.949
It's there for you.
I don't think i've had anybody

01:24:42.083 --> 01:24:44.618
Take my notes like you do and
put them into motion like we do.

01:24:44.752 --> 01:24:45.852
