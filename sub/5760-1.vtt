00:15.957 --> 00:19.823
Sit next to this man, Melinda.
We're gonna help him.

01:01.412 --> 01:04.790
- Grandma...
- It's alright, honey.

01:14.430 --> 01:18.170
You and your grandmother are
the only ones here who could see me.

01:18.205 --> 01:20.555
Will you help me?

01:22.479 --> 01:24.496
That's my wife.

01:24.531 --> 01:27.106
We've been together for 26 years.

01:27.141 --> 01:28.411
Then I had to go.

01:28.446 --> 01:32.108
I had to go so quickly, I didn't
have time to say goodbye to her.

01:32.143 --> 01:36.148
Didn't have enough time
to tell her how much I love her.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.833
And she really needs to hear it now.

01:38.868 --> 01:41.484
Will you give her that message for me?

01:42.457 --> 01:45.345
How will she know it's from you?

01:49.964 --> 01:55.762
Tell her I want her to keep having a
glass of champagne every Friday night.

01:55.797 --> 01:59.763
I want her to light the fire
like we always did.

01:59.798 --> 02:03.729
And make our secret toast
to the moon and stars

02:03.764 --> 02:06.423
like we always did.

02:06.458 --> 02:11.360
And tell her to never feel alone.

02:13.071 --> 02:15.288
And then she'll know.

03:05.621 --> 03:07.838
I don't understand.

03:08.716 --> 03:13.041
I know honey. But you will.

03:50.701 --> 03:53.195
Can't we sneak out?
They'll never miss us.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.065
We haven't collected
all of our gifts yet. / Oh, true.

03:58.100 --> 04:02.890
Besides, your Uncle Benny might fall into
the band stand and we can't miss that.

04:07.577 --> 04:11.225
I think he was dancing with Ann,
that's what happened.

04:11.260 --> 04:28.124
She kicked him with her boots.
Now, that may be the perfect couple.

04:28.159 --> 04:31.195
Don't tell me you see something.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.673
No...

04:32.708 --> 04:35.270
- No, no, no way. It's nothing.
- That's good, that's good.

04:35.305 --> 04:37.832
Because it'll be nice to keep
the celebration, you know?

04:37.867 --> 04:40.553
- Among the living.
- The night is young.

04:50.486 --> 04:51.615
Hey.

04:52.345 --> 04:54.214
Don't tell me, I scared you.

04:54.249 --> 04:56.943
Very funny. I just didn't know
if you were gonna make it.

04:56.978 --> 05:00.456
You kidding? Finally get to see
my only brother settled down.

05:00.491 --> 05:03.680
You guys look pretty delirious to me.

05:03.715 --> 05:06.579
We're happy. We are, it's just...

05:06.614 --> 05:09.409
Jim is struggling with the job a bit.

05:09.444 --> 05:11.829
The only paramedic
who hates the sign of blood.

05:11.864 --> 05:14.274
Someone died on him last week.

05:14.309 --> 05:16.915
First time, he's just having
a hard time dealing with it.

05:17.706 --> 05:20.234
One time I took a head off a roof in college.

05:20.269 --> 05:22.917
Don't ask me what I was doing on the roof.

05:22.952 --> 05:25.566
Broke damn more bones than I knew I had.

05:26.344 --> 05:27.820
He was right there though.

05:27.855 --> 05:29.262
I was scared to death.

05:29.297 --> 05:32.656
- But the way he talked to meÂ¡Â¦
- Yeah, I know.

05:32.691 --> 05:34.895
The thing about Jim is,

05:34.930 --> 05:37.064
he can take away your fear.

05:37.099 --> 05:39.645
He makes more of a
difference than he knows.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.663
He would so love to hear that from you.

05:43.448 --> 05:45.412
I'm giving it to you.

05:45.447 --> 05:49.204
Save it for when he's really
ready to throw in the towels.

05:49.239 --> 05:50.921
You'll know.

07:13.419 --> 07:14.347
Hey, Andrea.

07:14.382 --> 07:18.782
Boss, no way.
You can not be here today.

07:18.817 --> 07:20.035
It's just for the afternoon.

07:20.070 --> 07:23.481
Jim's got some big surprise going
he wants me to stay away from.

07:23.516 --> 07:25.758
And this is the only place
you can think of to come?

07:25.793 --> 07:28.091
That is unbelievably sad for you.

07:28.126 --> 07:30.301
Speak and Understand Latin.

07:30.336 --> 07:32.477
A Conversation in Latin.

07:32.512 --> 07:34.144
Latin for dummies.

07:34.179 --> 07:35.635
Please not another hobby.

07:35.670 --> 07:37.190
It is not a hobby.

07:37.225 --> 07:39.069
I'm trying to improve my mind.

07:39.104 --> 07:42.445
I thought you were teaching yourself
how to play the guitar. / I was.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.994
Wicked blisters though.

07:44.029 --> 07:46.459
Hey, you know. No one
actually speaks Latin anymore.

07:46.494 --> 07:48.857
That is exactly what
appealed to me about it.

07:48.892 --> 07:50.624
So, what does Jim have planned?

07:50.659 --> 07:54.717
I don't know. He's ubssesed with
making up for no honeymoon.

07:54.752 --> 07:56.376
As well he should be.

07:56.411 --> 07:59.956
Well, let's see. Two weeks
in Bermuda or Andrea's salary?

07:59.991 --> 08:02.256
Honeymoons are totally overrated.

08:03.810 --> 08:05.308
What's this?

08:05.343 --> 08:07.297
I don't know. I thought you brought it in.

08:08.331 --> 08:10.124
Well, I've seen it before.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.804
Or something like it.

08:29.923 --> 08:32.556
I shouldn't have that
second bottle of wine.

08:32.591 --> 08:36.164
You know, you only have to do this
for the doorway not the whole street.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.669
Well now she tells me.

08:37.705 --> 08:40.811
Alright, here we are. Final turn.

08:40.846 --> 08:43.918
Our first night in our new home.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.453
Let me make a note of that.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.146
Alright, step one.
Move blind fold.

08:54.181 --> 08:55.325
Thank you.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.470
Step two...

08:58.140 --> 08:59.265
Close one eye.

08:59.300 --> 09:03.855
So, you'll only see the part
of it that's almost finished.

09:04.939 --> 09:07.950
Damn, wrong eye.

09:07.985 --> 09:09.865
I love it.

09:09.900 --> 09:12.372
I love it, you must have
worked like a month of nights.

09:12.407 --> 09:15.421
Yeah, don't be too impressed.
The inside still looks like Lego Land.

09:15.456 --> 09:17.275
I don't care.

09:17.310 --> 09:19.095
It's our home.

09:19.922 --> 09:21.865
Our home.

09:39.852 --> 09:41.518
Bad one?

09:41.553 --> 09:43.185
The usual.

09:46.187 --> 09:50.443
Have anything to do with what
you saw while we were dancing?

09:52.903 --> 09:55.302
I thought you were
trying to give this a rest.

09:55.337 --> 09:59.365
Yeah, when you find the remote
that turns it off, you let me know.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.532
I'm just worrying about you, that's all.

10:03.761 --> 10:06.287
- You're looking out for me, huh?
- No, I'm looking out for me.

10:06.322 --> 10:08.874
You punch pretty hard
during those damn dreams.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.427
Yeah, maybe I was
faking those bad dreams.

10:13.646 --> 10:16.426
Just think you're backing a lot of pain.

10:16.461 --> 10:18.850
Other people's pain, not mine.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.183
Becomes yours.

10:21.218 --> 10:23.772
Look who's talking, Mr. Paramedics.

10:28.533 --> 10:31.697
- It's hard to get used to.
- What?

10:31.732 --> 10:34.653
Being cared about so much.

10:38.030 --> 10:40.245
I know my business

10:45.122 --> 10:47.878
I'm taking it, I'm taking it, boss.

11:40.810 --> 11:47.065
Help me.

12:02.279 --> 12:03.727
In your house?

12:03.762 --> 12:05.826
Yeah, it never happened before.

12:06.753 --> 12:08.947
As we say in Latin.

12:08.982 --> 12:11.106
What did Jim say?

12:11.141 --> 12:14.459
You know I made an executive decision
not to spoil the moment.

12:14.494 --> 12:16.147
Good call.

12:16.182 --> 12:17.894
So, is there a difference between

12:17.929 --> 12:20.728
a ghost that come right by your house
and the ones you see on the street?

12:20.763 --> 12:22.185
No, they're all earth-bound spirits.

12:22.220 --> 12:25.047
Just some of them are stuck heremore than the others.

12:25.082 --> 12:27.666
Are there spirits here?
Right now?

12:27.701 --> 12:31.192
- Only two.
- Right...

12:31.723 --> 12:34.032
Here in this shop?
Where?

12:34.067 --> 12:37.988
Well, there's an older woman sitting
next to that guy with the lap top.

12:38.023 --> 12:40.088
Probably his mother.

12:41.574 --> 12:43.270
What do they look like?

12:43.305 --> 12:45.789
Well, if they have trouble coming
through they look pretty scary

12:45.824 --> 12:47.700
but once they realize
where they really are

12:47.735 --> 12:50.247
they start to look like you and me.

12:50.282 --> 12:52.416
Go talk to her.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.697
And the espresso guy?

12:54.732 --> 12:58.463
There's an older guy standing right
behind him talking to him in Spanish.

12:58.498 --> 13:01.481
He doesn't understand
why his son can't hear him.

13:01.516 --> 13:03.322
Okay, you are really freaking me out.

13:03.357 --> 13:05.633
Are you saying that
Village Drava is haunted?

13:05.668 --> 13:07.551
No, places aren't haunted.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.028
People are haunted.

13:09.063 --> 13:11.476
So, then why is this guy haunting you?

13:12.393 --> 13:14.080
He's lost.

13:42.737 --> 13:44.435
Jim?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.270
Hey?

14:07.305 --> 14:09.691
What are you doing?

14:09.726 --> 14:10.641
The wind.

14:10.676 --> 14:14.595
Threw the top off of things.
I'm just trying it back on.

14:14.630 --> 14:17.932
Go back in bed.
I'll be there in a minute.

14:17.967 --> 14:21.234
The window just came off
in my hands.

14:21.269 --> 14:22.555
That?

14:22.590 --> 14:24.300
I meant for that to happen.

14:25.559 --> 14:27.239
Be careful.

14:41.912 --> 14:44.672
I don't know where I am.

14:46.074 --> 14:48.881
I need you to help me.

14:48.916 --> 14:51.688
They told me you could.

14:51.723 --> 14:53.525
Who told you?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.328
I don't know.

14:56.286 --> 14:58.536
You're not supposed
to be in my home.

14:58.571 --> 15:01.713
This is not how this works.

15:01.748 --> 15:04.856
Please, I have to go home.

15:04.891 --> 15:07.253
My wife is pregnant.

15:07.288 --> 15:10.216
She doesn't know where I am.

15:10.251 --> 15:13.144
What do you see around you?

15:14.070 --> 15:16.557
I'm in a valley.

15:17.439 --> 15:19.946
A low valley.

15:19.981 --> 15:22.418
It's dark.

15:22.453 --> 15:25.835
Please help me.

15:25.870 --> 15:28.259
I don't know if I can.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.863
What's your name?

15:29.898 --> 15:32.461
Paul Adams.

15:32.496 --> 15:37.243
I'm a sergeant from Fort Driscol.

15:48.620 --> 15:51.449
Sorry, I know I said I'd be there at ten.
I'm on my way.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.443
Na, it's okay.

15:52.478 --> 15:54.454
There aren't many customers anyway.

15:54.489 --> 15:56.431
Oh, stop trying to cheer me up.

15:56.466 --> 15:57.546
Oh!

16:00.102 --> 16:02.672
What? What?
Are you okay?

16:04.650 --> 16:06.823
- Melinda?
- Oh, yeah.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.997
I almost hit a dog.

16:11.654 --> 16:14.644
I may just be just a few more minutes.

16:39.465 --> 16:41.412
Vietnam War

16:42.822 --> 16:46.031
Sgt Paul Adams, Jun 1972, MIA

17:02.706 --> 17:05.358
I'm sorry about the mess.

17:05.394 --> 17:08.994
We had a meeting last night that
unfortunately erupted into fibster cups.

17:09.030 --> 17:10.800
- Politics?
- Baseball.

17:10.836 --> 17:13.673
So, your boy there, Paul Adams.
He's from the village?

17:13.708 --> 17:14.848
Yeah, I think so.

17:14.884 --> 17:16.775
I'm trying to get the
family's information on him.

17:16.810 --> 17:19.023
He was listed MIA in 1972

17:19.059 --> 17:20.928
and my husband told me
that I should come and see you.

17:20.963 --> 17:23.493
Cause if anyone should know,
you would.

17:23.529 --> 17:26.026
I'm flattered above all the recognition.

17:26.060 --> 17:28.688
Okay, so how can I be at service?

17:28.723 --> 17:29.994
I don't really know.

17:30.029 --> 17:31.778
Draft records, Enlistment records

17:31.813 --> 17:34.613
anything that might trace his
whereabouts the year he went missing.

17:34.648 --> 17:37.658
I know that he was
stationed at Fort Driscol.

17:37.693 --> 17:41.114
Let me check on the computer
at the back and see what comes up.

17:41.149 --> 17:42.373
I don't want to put you out.

17:42.408 --> 17:45.445
Oh, yeah. I much rather
be sweeping up this day breed

17:45.480 --> 17:48.482
than helping a beautiful
young thing such as yourself.

17:57.897 --> 18:00.334
You can see me, can't you?

18:00.369 --> 18:02.150
Oh, come on.

18:02.185 --> 18:04.774
You can to, see me.
I'm not blind.

18:04.809 --> 18:07.328
Alright, yes, yes, I can see you.

18:07.363 --> 18:09.226
But you know what?
It's really not a good time.

18:09.261 --> 18:10.577
It's a small thing.

18:10.612 --> 18:13.153
You have to tell Joe
the key to the safe deposit box

18:13.188 --> 18:15.298
is in the pocket of my blue rain coat.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.286
I left it there the last time
I had it and

18:17.321 --> 18:19.239
there's so many papersand insurance things...

18:19.274 --> 18:20.865
How can I tell him something like that?

18:20.900 --> 18:21.983
I mean, what's he gonna think?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.359
Excuse me...

18:23.394 --> 18:25.153
I am the one who's been
hanging around here for

18:25.188 --> 18:27.407
who knows how long trying
to find someone to let him know.

18:27.442 --> 18:30.493
So, who has the bigger problem?
You or me?

18:30.528 --> 18:33.760
I came up with the same
last name but only a first initial.

18:33.795 --> 18:35.984
Now there is an address
but who knows?

18:36.019 --> 18:38.139
It could be a condo
or a mall by now.

18:38.174 --> 18:40.758
Well, it's a good start.
And I really appreciate it.

18:40.793 --> 18:41.900
Don't mention it.

18:41.935 --> 18:46.989
Anytime you want to come by for a little
more skin related conversation, please do.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.233
Umm.. you know.

18:51.025 --> 18:54.192
You know what I really
have a bad habit of doing?

18:54.227 --> 19:00.993
Sometimes I leave really
important things in my coat pockets.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.142
I forget about them.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.595
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:07.630 --> 19:10.049
Will you just tell him?

19:11.838 --> 19:13.675
Okay, I know how
this is gonna sound

19:13.710 --> 19:15.477
but I have a message
from your wife.

19:15.512 --> 19:19.478
She wants you to know that the safe
deposit box key is in her blue raincoat.

19:20.507 --> 19:22.113
Goodbye.

19:22.858 --> 19:24.198
Yes!

20:13.288 --> 20:15.201
Sorry, to bother you.

20:15.236 --> 20:18.244
Do you know if a family named
Adams ever lived here?

20:18.279 --> 20:20.416
Still do. Want to buy?

20:20.451 --> 20:23.507
Tempting, especially cause
it's already built and all.

20:23.542 --> 20:25.447
How long has it been in your family?

20:25.482 --> 20:26.813
And you are?

20:26.848 --> 20:28.109
Melinda Gordon.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.506
I live on the other side of the village.

20:29.541 --> 20:30.800
Michael Adams.

20:30.835 --> 20:34.663
My parents used to live here.
When my mother died, I took it over.

20:34.698 --> 20:36.659
Are you Paul Adam's son?

20:36.694 --> 20:37.839
Why?

20:37.874 --> 20:40.026
He served in Vietnam.

20:40.061 --> 20:42.179
How do you know that?

20:42.214 --> 20:43.322
Sorry.

20:43.357 --> 20:46.219
I'm collecting information
on some local Vietnam vets.

20:46.254 --> 20:49.764
And I found your father's name
at the VFW post.

20:49.799 --> 20:51.751
I'm sorry,
I can't really tell you much.

20:51.786 --> 20:55.582
But your father is listed MIA
did the army ever give you any...

20:55.617 --> 20:56.888
No, they just said that he was MIA.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.692
Presumed dead three months
before I was born.

21:00.612 --> 21:03.127
There's a mark at the cemetery.

21:03.946 --> 21:05.599
Nobody ever found him.

21:06.684 --> 21:09.388
I'm so sorry.

21:09.423 --> 21:11.946
Do you know what unit he was in?

21:11.981 --> 21:14.434
Yeah, 5th infantry.
Red Diamonds.

21:14.469 --> 21:17.120
He had a brown star
and a purple heart.

21:17.155 --> 21:19.632
He was an expert marksman.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.074
He was funny and reliable.

21:22.109 --> 21:25.420
That's at least what my mom said.

21:25.455 --> 21:28.696
He had very neat handwriting.

21:28.731 --> 21:31.281
And you said
you couldn't tell me much.

21:31.316 --> 21:35.319
My mom used to tell me
stories about him every night.

21:35.354 --> 21:37.512
She wanted me to know him.

21:37.547 --> 21:40.502
She wanted me to know
that he was a hero.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.841
Please, tell me if you find out
anything about my dad...

21:46.876 --> 21:48.328
Anything.

21:48.363 --> 21:52.031
It's amazing how much you can
miss somebody you've never met.

21:52.066 --> 21:53.927
I will.

21:53.962 --> 21:55.895
But I don't want to keep you.

21:55.930 --> 22:00.007
Thanks for talking with me
and I'll be in touch.

22:15.581 --> 22:16.698
Oh, my god.

22:16.733 --> 22:18.373
You must be dying to tell him.

22:18.408 --> 22:22.276
Tell him what? That his dead father was
dripping mud in my living room last week?

22:22.311 --> 22:24.200
Point taken. Probably not the best move.

22:24.235 --> 22:25.766
Did he look like his father?

22:25.801 --> 22:29.198
- Yeah, a little.
- Around the eyes.

22:29.233 --> 22:32.561
- Was he single by any chance?
- No.

22:32.596 --> 22:36.150
But the thing is, his wife is like,
9 months pregnant.

22:36.185 --> 22:37.385
It made me realize something.

22:37.420 --> 22:38.966
Paul told me that his wife was pregnant.

22:39.001 --> 22:39.882
But what he doesn't realize

22:39.917 --> 22:42.384
is that it's his son's wife
that's about to have a baby.

22:42.419 --> 22:43.767
Not his wife.

22:43.802 --> 22:45.711
You know, it really explains a lot.

22:45.746 --> 22:48.406
Right, although not to me.

22:48.441 --> 22:51.143
Whenever there's a
big change in a family

22:51.178 --> 22:52.694
like a child is about to be born.

22:52.729 --> 22:54.905
It sends a ripple effect
to the spirit world.

22:54.940 --> 22:58.476
It wakes up a spirit someone close.
That is why Paul's here.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.340
Just really doesn't understand why yet.

23:01.375 --> 23:04.101
- You're gonna have to tell him.
- I know.

23:04.136 --> 23:06.827
Just have to wait
until he finds me again.

23:50.925 --> 23:52.926
Who told you that I could help you?

23:52.961 --> 23:55.124
Melinda!

23:58.184 --> 24:00.514
Hey, hey, it's okay.

24:01.185 --> 24:01.893
Just a dream.

24:01.928 --> 24:04.932
- Sorry.
- Alright.

24:04.967 --> 24:07.431
You're helping someone, aren't you?

24:09.334 --> 24:12.092
I know I said I'd give it
a rest but I can't...

24:12.930 --> 24:15.309
I can't help it.
He's a solider and...

24:15.344 --> 24:17.654
You don't have to explain it to me.

24:17.689 --> 24:20.437
Well, come just ask me
to keep it at arms length.

24:20.472 --> 24:22.903
Remember the magic word.

24:22.938 --> 24:24.621
Balance.

24:36.914 --> 24:38.918
Vietnam June 1972

24:42.843 --> 24:44.377
Vietnam June 1972

24:52.306 --> 24:53.741
Lo Valley

25:09.795 --> 25:11.406
Follow me.

25:16.157 --> 25:19.011
Paul, you told me that you
were in a low valley of some kind.

25:19.046 --> 25:23.376
I think you might have actually been
in the place called the Lo Valley.

25:23.411 --> 25:25.874
L- O and...

25:25.909 --> 25:29.046
I just need for you
to remember your last day there.

25:29.081 --> 25:30.899
Remember what happened?

25:31.857 --> 25:34.780
Sometimes, I see bits and pieces.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.390
I remember being in a helicopter.

25:38.425 --> 25:42.360
I could see tracers coming up
at us from the tree tops.

25:42.395 --> 25:44.355
I could feel the chopper slipping.

25:44.390 --> 25:48.957
I could hear the pain
and bullets off the hallway.

25:48.992 --> 25:51.071
And I knew we were hit.

25:51.106 --> 25:53.116
We were going down.

25:53.151 --> 25:56.370
I remember seeing a waterfall
as we went down.

25:56.405 --> 25:58.640
I remember thinking
how beautiful it was

25:58.675 --> 26:02.506
and I was glad that the last thing
I was gonna see was pretty.

26:02.541 --> 26:04.798
And I remember crying.

26:04.833 --> 26:07.637
Because I was never
gonna see my baby.

26:22.283 --> 26:24.049
In memoriam Paul Adams Vietnam Sgt
5th Infantry Division June 1972, MIA

26:24.084 --> 26:26.081
Husband, Father, Hero
Gone but never forgotten.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.118
It can't be.

26:34.153 --> 26:37.922
My wife, she's pregnant.

26:37.957 --> 26:42.233
She had a son, three months
after you were reported missing.

26:42.268 --> 26:46.509
He's 33 now with a wife and
a baby of his own on the way.

26:47.668 --> 26:49.837
I missed it all?

26:53.716 --> 26:55.800
It's like I just woke up and...

26:56.594 --> 26:58.019
now it's all over.

26:58.054 --> 27:00.532
You have a son
who is very proud of you.

27:01.395 --> 27:03.284
He has all of your medals and

27:03.319 --> 27:05.173
he knows everything about you.

27:06.265 --> 27:07.937
My wife...

27:07.972 --> 27:09.929
is she alright?

27:12.028 --> 27:14.414
I'm so sorry.

27:16.533 --> 27:19.766
He mentioned that
she died a while ago I think.

27:32.045 --> 27:33.347
What's his name?

27:34.510 --> 27:36.349
My son?

27:36.384 --> 27:38.189
Michael.

27:42.347 --> 27:44.815
That was my father's name.

27:46.246 --> 27:48.746
That's what I wanted.

27:48.781 --> 27:51.247
I just can't believe it.

27:52.228 --> 27:55.151
I loved my life so much.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.796
I was just getting started.

28:05.373 --> 28:07.203
Can you...

28:09.247 --> 28:11.643
Can you talk to my wife?

28:11.678 --> 28:14.040
Can you let me see her?

28:14.075 --> 28:16.133
I wish I could.

28:16.686 --> 28:19.445
But I can only see spirits
who haven't crossed over yet.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.063
Cross over where?

28:23.049 --> 28:25.334
Into the light.

28:26.648 --> 28:29.527
Does my son know how I died?

28:29.562 --> 28:32.407
Just that you were reported MIA.

28:36.076 --> 28:37.797
Will you...

28:38.611 --> 28:40.502
Will you tell him?

28:47.178 --> 28:49.856
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

28:50.829 --> 28:54.881
You asked me to tell you if I got
any new information about your father.

28:54.916 --> 28:56.250
And?

28:57.307 --> 28:59.887
Your father died in a helicopter crash

28:59.922 --> 29:02.276
above a place called Lo Valley.

29:02.311 --> 29:06.655
I don't know much about the place except
it's pretty remote near a waterfall.

29:06.690 --> 29:08.656
Maybe you can take
that information to the Pentagon

29:08.691 --> 29:11.070
and see if they can
come up with anything.

29:11.105 --> 29:13.197
How do you know this?

29:15.759 --> 29:18.402
You should also know
that his last moments...

29:18.437 --> 29:20.629
he was thinking of you.

29:20.664 --> 29:24.045
He was heart broken that
he would never see his child.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.682
What?

29:25.717 --> 29:27.081
How could you know that?

29:27.116 --> 29:29.053
Your father came to me for help.

29:29.088 --> 29:31.921
I don't understand
what you're trying to say. Just tell me...

29:31.956 --> 29:34.576
Look the thing is
I have a gift.

29:34.611 --> 29:37.880
Your father is dead.
But his spirit is still here.

29:37.915 --> 29:39.265
He just hasn't crossed over yet.

29:39.300 --> 29:43.426
And he wants you to know
where he is and what happened.

29:43.461 --> 29:47.553
I'm so sorry, I'm really
not explaining this very well.

29:50.603 --> 29:54.071
I guess I didn't realize
how transparent I am.

29:54.106 --> 29:59.204
There's been this giant hole in my life
as long as I can remember.

30:00.433 --> 30:04.116
Even now, I feel lost.

30:04.151 --> 30:07.333
I never got used
to him not being around.

30:07.368 --> 30:13.215
It takes somebody like you to see that
and take advantage of it?

30:15.579 --> 30:17.588
Get out of my house!

30:18.424 --> 30:20.176
Look, I think this was your fathers.

30:20.211 --> 30:22.317
And I know he'll want you to have it.

30:22.352 --> 30:24.423
What kind of person would do this?

30:24.458 --> 30:26.394
What kind of scam is this?

30:26.429 --> 30:27.574
What's next?

30:27.609 --> 30:30.809
Give you a hundred dollars and
send him a message for me?

30:31.900 --> 30:33.145
You come into my house

30:33.180 --> 30:36.363
you dishonor his memory
with this con job!

30:37.895 --> 30:39.232
Get out!

30:39.267 --> 30:40.535
Get! Out!

30:40.570 --> 30:42.760
I didn't ask you for anything.

30:42.795 --> 30:44.916
I don't want anything from you.

30:44.951 --> 30:48.216
Just please call the Pentagon and ask!

30:48.251 --> 30:51.080
Must be great having
supernatural powers.

30:52.949 --> 30:55.088
Not really!

31:13.188 --> 31:14.198
Jim?

31:15.315 --> 31:17.183
Hope we have some wine.

31:17.218 --> 31:18.820
Right here.

31:24.075 --> 31:26.171
Did we forget to pay the light bill?

31:26.206 --> 31:28.479
No, I have a headache.

31:28.514 --> 31:31.859
And I crossed to wires in the basement.

31:31.894 --> 31:33.730
Blew circuits.

31:33.765 --> 31:36.794
That's why you're a paramedic
and not an electrician.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.999
What's up?

31:41.880 --> 31:46.191
Does it ever seem weird to you that
we're both kind of in the death business?

31:46.226 --> 31:47.929
What?

31:47.964 --> 31:50.799
You know, I used to think
in a funny kind of way...

31:50.834 --> 31:53.849
I could keep them from you.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.394
You know...

31:56.429 --> 31:58.661
Lighten your load.

31:58.696 --> 32:00.274
Stupid.

32:01.515 --> 32:03.240
Hey.

32:05.206 --> 32:06.331
What happened?

32:08.837 --> 32:11.210
I almost lost another one today.

32:11.245 --> 32:14.069
A 55 year old guy
just collapsed on the street.

32:14.104 --> 32:16.893
You know, he was blue
before we even reached him.

32:18.288 --> 32:19.741
I worked on this guy 20 minutes.

32:19.776 --> 32:22.853
And the only thing
I can think the whole time

32:22.888 --> 32:25.896
was 'I am not gonna let him
get to you. I swear'

32:25.931 --> 32:29.154
I felt like I was gonna die
myself if this guy died.

32:29.189 --> 32:30.894
Did he?

32:30.929 --> 32:32.564
No.

32:32.599 --> 32:34.192
I brought him back.

32:35.542 --> 32:36.813
That's great.

32:36.848 --> 32:40.876
Honey, I can not stand
both of us being this way.

32:40.911 --> 32:45.776
You know, both of us dealing with...
who stays, who goes.

32:45.811 --> 32:47.504
I got to do something different.

32:47.539 --> 32:49.290
You know, someday
I'm gonna make a mistake

32:49.325 --> 32:51.385
and the next guy...

32:51.420 --> 32:53.715
He's not gonna come back.

32:56.282 --> 32:59.176
At least he's not
gonna come back to me.

33:05.933 --> 33:07.352
What are you thinking?

33:09.721 --> 33:12.067
I'm thinking about your brother.

33:13.354 --> 33:14.917
What he said to me.

33:15.974 --> 33:17.431
To you?

33:17.466 --> 33:20.650
He died before we even met.
And it was a Summer after...

33:25.855 --> 33:27.998
He was at our wedding.

33:37.456 --> 33:39.550
He was?

33:39.585 --> 33:42.046
He's been with you all along.

33:42.081 --> 33:44.507
Had to see you settle down.

33:44.542 --> 33:48.270
Had to see you happy.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.683
What did he say?

33:54.718 --> 33:59.479
He talked about falling off the roof
and how you held him.

33:59.514 --> 34:01.868
- How you talked to him...
- I couldn't save him.

34:01.903 --> 34:03.104
I was too late.

34:03.139 --> 34:04.705
Hey.

34:04.740 --> 34:07.898
No one could have saved him.

34:07.933 --> 34:11.362
It was just his time. That's all.

34:12.235 --> 34:13.529
But he wanted me to tell you something.

34:13.563 --> 34:18.110
And he wanted me to wait till you
were really ready to throw in the towel.

34:18.146 --> 34:20.664
He said, 'The thing about Jim is...

34:21.484 --> 34:24.347
He knows how to take all your fear away.

34:24.382 --> 34:26.588
People feel it.

34:26.623 --> 34:30.045
He makes more of a
difference than he knows. '

34:30.081 --> 34:32.695
He wouldn't want you to give up.

34:32.730 --> 34:35.925
Look, if there is one thing that I know...

34:36.882 --> 34:42.110
It's that what happens to these people
and their last moments, it really matters.

34:45.639 --> 34:50.043
And you do great work.
No matter what.

34:50.735 --> 34:53.576
We're in the life business.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.947
Death is just a part of it.

35:55.004 --> 35:56.015
Hi.

35:57.132 --> 35:58.439
Hi.

35:59.876 --> 36:02.148
My wife made me call the Pentagon.

36:02.183 --> 36:05.478
Given the information
that you gave me?

36:05.513 --> 36:07.685
They narrowed it down to
this place they believed

36:07.720 --> 36:10.540
my father was assigned to.

36:10.575 --> 36:13.326
In a chopper,
in June of 72.

36:13.361 --> 36:14.911
They're working with
the Vietnamese government

36:14.946 --> 36:18.758
to send a search team to see if...
they can find anything.

36:18.793 --> 36:22.125
Where did you get this information?

36:22.160 --> 36:24.207
How did you get this?

36:24.242 --> 36:26.219
I told you the truth.

36:26.254 --> 36:30.640
And I know it's really hard to believe
but I got my information from him.

36:33.767 --> 36:36.184
Is this real?

36:37.591 --> 36:39.838
I mean...

36:39.873 --> 36:42.535
Can you really talk to my father?

36:48.305 --> 36:52.496
Ask him if he still has the
last lighter I sent to his mother.

36:53.220 --> 36:58.198
The one where I told her to put
beside a picture of me facing his crib.

36:58.233 --> 37:00.363
Your father wants to know
if you have the last lighter

37:00.398 --> 37:03.282
- he sent to your mother...
- Is he here?

37:03.317 --> 37:05.844
Yeah, right here with us.

37:05.879 --> 37:09.097
Yes, tell him yes.

37:09.132 --> 37:12.041
Tell him, he grew up real good.

37:12.076 --> 37:14.855
Tell him I'm proud of him.

37:14.890 --> 37:17.463
He said you grew up really well.

37:17.498 --> 37:20.541
And he's proud of you.

37:20.576 --> 37:22.902
Did it hurt?

37:24.162 --> 37:27.004
Was he in pain?

37:28.391 --> 37:31.186
He doesn't really remember any of it.

37:31.221 --> 37:33.501
He just remembers thinking of you

37:33.536 --> 37:35.747
and your mother and he misses her...

37:35.782 --> 37:40.987
Tell him... / He can hear you.
He's right next to me.

37:42.904 --> 37:44.744
She...

37:44.779 --> 37:46.957
She never forgot about you.

37:46.992 --> 37:51.215
She told me storiesabout you every night.

37:51.692 --> 37:55.513
Mostly happy ones
but sometimes sad ones.

37:55.548 --> 37:58.927
She made you alive to me but...

37:58.962 --> 38:02.272
just made me miss you more.

38:02.307 --> 38:05.098
I mean, did you see me growing up?

38:05.133 --> 38:07.670
Tell him, I've been lost.

38:07.705 --> 38:10.202
But now I can.

38:10.237 --> 38:12.664
I see his wife

38:12.699 --> 38:14.906
and I'll see my grandchild.

38:16.331 --> 38:19.232
I'll always be close by.

38:19.267 --> 38:21.544
Always be watching.

38:21.579 --> 38:23.682
He said he was lost

38:23.717 --> 38:25.751
but now he can.

38:25.786 --> 38:29.514
And he'll always be close by
He will always be watching.

38:31.355 --> 38:34.199
We'll find you.

38:34.234 --> 38:37.311
If I have to go there myself
and find you, I will.

38:37.346 --> 38:39.678
I'll bring you back, I will.

38:39.713 --> 38:43.930
Tell him, he has to go home.
Go home to his wife, she needs him.

38:43.965 --> 38:46.240
It's all that matters now.

38:46.275 --> 38:49.422
When that baby comes into his life.

38:49.457 --> 38:52.570
Man, don't miss a second of it.

38:52.605 --> 38:54.494
Not one second.

38:56.358 --> 38:59.123
Nothing waits for you.

38:59.158 --> 39:02.220
That's one thing that
he's got to remember.

39:02.255 --> 39:06.326
He wants you to go
to your wife, she needs you.

39:06.361 --> 39:08.791
I don't want to leave.

39:08.826 --> 39:12.441
I mean, there's so much I want to know.
So many questions.

39:13.701 --> 39:15.712
He wants you to...

39:15.747 --> 39:20.307
He wants you to know that
everything you need is inside of you.

39:20.342 --> 39:22.928
And if you get lost, you just...

39:22.963 --> 39:26.560
You look at that compass
cause it got him home.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.390
Tell him, I'll walk with him.

39:35.139 --> 39:37.358
He wants to walk with you.

39:40.565 --> 39:42.890
Thank you.

39:53.716 --> 39:55.676
Dad?

39:56.707 --> 39:59.226
Are you there?

40:25.954 --> 40:27.705
Oh, man. It's cold.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.478
Do you have your keys?

40:30.513 --> 40:33.706
I do / You always forget your keys.
Okay.

40:34.582 --> 40:36.424
Hey, are you sure you
don't want me to go with you?

40:36.459 --> 40:38.975
Go to work, I'll be fine.

40:45.096 --> 40:46.844
You better miss me.

40:46.879 --> 40:48.653
I do already.

41:05.153 --> 41:07.367
Present arms.

41:09.651 --> 41:18.829
Aim. Fire!

41:34.642 --> 41:37.254
What do you think of your grandson?

41:37.289 --> 41:40.636
It's funny. I look at him...

41:40.671 --> 41:43.984
and I feel I can go now.

41:45.464 --> 41:47.325
Can I?

41:49.277 --> 41:51.921
Feels like it's time.

41:53.096 --> 41:54.891
If you're ready, you should...

41:54.926 --> 41:56.942
See something.

41:56.977 --> 41:58.959
Or someone.

42:01.335 --> 42:03.418
Is that what that is?

42:03.453 --> 42:05.505
That light?

42:05.540 --> 42:07.522
I don't know.

42:07.557 --> 42:09.723
You're the only one that kind see it.

42:09.758 --> 42:11.969
I do see it.

42:12.004 --> 42:14.309
Right over by that tree.

42:18.556 --> 42:22.613
What? What do you see?

42:23.221 --> 42:25.414
My wife.

42:26.442 --> 42:29.117
She's standing right there.

42:30.229 --> 42:32.375
She's telling me to come.

42:35.507 --> 42:39.608
She looks as
beautiful as the day I left.

43:40.681 --> 43:42.976
Can you see us?
