01:15.808 --> 01:17.343
<i>Hello, Decker.</i>

01:17.376 --> 01:20.379
<i>I'm at Chateau Nightclub,
on 17...</i>

01:20.412 --> 01:22.148
<i>with some of
my girl friends.</i>

01:22.180 --> 01:23.548
<i>Are you coming tonight?</i>

01:23.581 --> 01:25.117
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

01:25.150 --> 01:27.619
<i>Text me when you're out, bye.</i>

01:30.522 --> 01:34.126
<i>Decker, just seeing if you
got my message about tonight.</i>

01:34.159 --> 01:37.262
<i>It would be great
if you can text me.</i>

02:17.502 --> 02:18.803
<i>That's me, Michael Decker.</i>

02:18.836 --> 02:21.173
<i>Ex-pat, ex a lot of things,</i>

02:21.206 --> 02:23.942
<i>but none of them for the
reasons you might think.</i>

02:23.975 --> 02:29.314
<i>In my life, nothing ever happens
for the reasons you might think.</i>

02:36.388 --> 02:37.623
Hey.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.702
Hey, what's going on here?

02:50.735 --> 02:52.637
- What was that for?
- It was money for you!

02:52.670 --> 02:54.941
For me, it was my fucking money,
so give me my fucking money.

02:54.973 --> 02:57.409
Don't buy jewelries
with my money, girl.

02:57.443 --> 02:58.811
- Hey.
- What?

02:58.843 --> 03:01.280
Leave her alone.
Get your hands off the lady.

03:01.312 --> 03:03.949
We're fine, man.
We're good, okay.

03:03.983 --> 03:06.319
We're just having
a little, fuck...

03:06.352 --> 03:08.554
How do you say,
a little, disagreement.

03:08.586 --> 03:10.322
- Come with me.
- No, no, no.

03:10.355 --> 03:11.790
I already told you, man.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.993
Alright, we're fine.

03:14.026 --> 03:15.795
We got no fucking problem.

03:15.828 --> 03:18.230
We don't need any
fucking around, alright.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.298
This stupid bitch.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.266
The lady's coming with me.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.969
So you're a fucking American,
is that...

03:27.939 --> 03:31.009
Come with me,
I'll take you home.

03:31.043 --> 03:34.514
The fuck...
come back here.

03:36.514 --> 03:38.350
Mother fuck...

03:53.665 --> 03:55.467
We're done here.

04:07.979 --> 04:09.715
He's got a gun!

04:39.095 --> 04:45.095
Subrip by DanDee

04:58.896 --> 05:01.399
What the hell
happened to my car?

05:01.432 --> 05:02.534
That's my car!

05:06.572 --> 05:09.542
Just wait.
We will take care of everything.

05:11.543 --> 05:12.978
The shooter's over there.

05:13.011 --> 05:15.915
He says he would only speak
with you. Says he knows you.

05:15.947 --> 05:19.851
Girl over there is a witness,
backs up his story.

05:31.829 --> 05:35.767
Look what the cat
dragged in, Michael.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.902
- How are you doing?
- Doing good.

05:37.935 --> 05:39.871
But I've been better.

05:39.904 --> 05:40.972
How's Delphine?

05:41.005 --> 05:42.974
Oh, you know how it is.

05:43.007 --> 05:44.576
We are getting older.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.713
But she keeps herself fit,
can't complain.

05:47.745 --> 05:51.149
I think, uh, some folks are
gonna want to look at this, now.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.991
Didn't turn out
very good but...

05:59.024 --> 06:01.026
Is that all you are carrying?

06:01.059 --> 06:03.028
That's it.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.830
By the way, you know,
he did have a gun

06:05.863 --> 06:07.599
and he was shooting
at me, and if I hadn't

06:07.632 --> 06:09.467
had that, I'd be dead now.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.169
Obviously I can carry gun

06:11.202 --> 06:12.904
wherever the
American flag flies,

06:12.937 --> 06:14.439
but I do have a
special arrangement

06:14.473 --> 06:16.975
here once in a while, so.

06:17.009 --> 06:20.513
You didn't answer
my question, Michael.

06:20.545 --> 06:22.147
What's your question?

06:22.180 --> 06:25.116
Are you carrying another piece?

06:25.149 --> 06:26.519
No.

06:27.853 --> 06:31.824
Okay. Let them conduct
the investigation.

06:31.857 --> 06:34.527
Well, you know,
please keep in mind,

06:34.560 --> 06:38.430
like I said,
if I hadn't been armed,

06:38.463 --> 06:41.166
I'd be dead right now
and there ain't nothing wrong

06:41.199 --> 06:43.067
with self defense,
even in France.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.069
Michael... Yes.

06:45.103 --> 06:46.805
Still, believe me
when I tell you

06:46.838 --> 06:49.841
that that shooting team over
there is going to watch long

06:49.875 --> 06:53.512
and hard at you,
because of your past.

06:53.545 --> 06:55.448
But I was exonerated.

06:55.480 --> 06:59.117
That doesn't mean you didn't put the
the scumbag into a bag, does it?

06:59.151 --> 07:01.554
No, it doesn't.

07:01.586 --> 07:04.889
Well, come on, let's get some
coffee down at the station,

07:04.923 --> 07:07.793
while I fill out
the paper work.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.482
I need to ask you a few
questions about last night.

07:29.514 --> 07:30.882
Mademoiselle, please.

07:30.915 --> 07:34.853
Mark and initial any
correction, and sign it.

07:36.822 --> 07:40.024
Why are you getting so motherfucking
formal with me, man?

07:40.057 --> 07:42.661
I'm a fucking ghost
over here, man.

07:42.694 --> 07:44.263
I don't exist.

07:44.295 --> 07:47.699
Michael, I didn't know you
were working undercover here.

07:47.733 --> 07:50.569
Well, that would be the
reason for being undercover

07:50.601 --> 07:52.837
is to not tell people
you're undercover.

07:52.870 --> 07:56.541
Whatever, just sign
the goddamn statement.

07:56.574 --> 07:58.676
Sun is coming up and I'm tired.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.745
What the girl said...

08:00.778 --> 08:03.214
I can't discuss that with you.

08:03.247 --> 08:05.750
I just wanna know
if she's backing up my story,

08:05.783 --> 08:09.721
you know, if she's sharing the same
version that actually happened.

08:09.754 --> 08:11.055
Hmm, your version?

08:11.088 --> 08:12.690
Hey, man, no two people remember

08:12.723 --> 08:14.225
the same shit the same way.

08:14.259 --> 08:17.862
I can't tell you
what the other witness said.

08:17.896 --> 08:21.667
Look, man,
I killed this guy tonight.

08:21.699 --> 08:25.570
All I want to find out
is who he is.

08:27.338 --> 08:28.940
'Cause I'm stuck here
and I can't get

08:28.973 --> 08:31.276
to my people to
find out nothing.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.611
Michael, listen to me.

08:33.644 --> 08:35.813
How long have we been friends?

08:35.846 --> 08:38.149
Back when you was young,
dumb, and full of cum,

08:38.182 --> 08:40.152
and had a fucking
full head of hair,

08:40.183 --> 08:42.720
and you were about
50 pounds lighter.

08:42.754 --> 08:47.893
Funny. Long enough for me to know
you got a bum wrap from the agency.

08:47.926 --> 08:52.031
I get it, I get it.
American style, fuck the police.

08:52.063 --> 08:55.934
You know what? I would have
felt the same way, too.

08:55.967 --> 08:58.570
Old school guys like you and I,

08:58.604 --> 09:01.607
are the only one left who
still respect each other.

09:04.241 --> 09:08.680
So, read it and sign it.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.616
Let's go home.

09:10.649 --> 09:13.318
Why in the world
would I shoot some dumbass

09:13.351 --> 09:16.187
white bitch in the
fucking parking lot,

09:16.221 --> 09:21.626
to blow my fucking cover and
get me into all kinds of bullshit.

09:21.659 --> 09:25.163
You typed the motherfucker
up, you sign it.

09:25.197 --> 09:29.601
And by the way, that's my favorite
fucking gun y'all took.

09:29.634 --> 09:30.338
It's evidence.

09:30.339 --> 09:33.139
Since when do you give a
fuck about the evidence?

09:33.171 --> 09:35.941
It's a justifiable
shooting, man.

09:35.974 --> 09:38.344
It's procedure, Michael.
I'm sorry.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.089
You took my favorite gun.

09:52.289 --> 09:54.926
Ronnie Martin, Ronnie Martin.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.096
Thirty-two years old,
born in Houston, Texas.

09:58.129 --> 10:00.231
I already stole that
shit off the reporter.

10:00.264 --> 10:02.268
I don't need you no more.

10:03.034 --> 10:05.236
Owns a nightclub.

10:05.269 --> 10:07.405
Owned, I guess I should say.

10:07.438 --> 10:09.774
Yeah, you should.

10:28.393 --> 10:30.229
<i>That's trouble right there.</i>

10:30.261 --> 10:32.130
<i>In my life,
trouble always comes</i>

10:32.163 --> 10:36.968
<i>in a small black dress
and legs for days. Always.</i>

10:48.245 --> 10:50.649
- Long night, huh?
- Yeah.

10:52.083 --> 10:55.219
But, then again, it's a new day.

10:55.253 --> 10:57.790
Sorry about your boyfriend.

11:01.793 --> 11:05.697
You seem completely
torn up about that.

11:05.730 --> 11:09.333
Well, we were only
together for a short time.

11:09.366 --> 11:10.735
I see.

11:10.769 --> 11:13.706
We met at the club
where I used to dance.

11:13.739 --> 11:17.143
He made me quit dancing
and ended up buying the club.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.312
Hey, can we smoke out here?

11:20.345 --> 11:22.181
It's France, man.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.049
You can smoke, like,
in the Louvre.

11:24.081 --> 11:25.484
You can smoke anywhere here.

11:25.517 --> 11:26.886
Hmm.

11:28.519 --> 11:29.822
Thanks.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.202
Ronnie had money, too.

11:44.235 --> 11:46.337
A lot of money.

11:46.370 --> 11:48.307
A lot of money, lot of money.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.242
Where do you think
he got all that money?

11:50.274 --> 11:53.077
Lieutenant said you used to be
a cop back in the States.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.779
Something like that.

11:54.812 --> 11:56.814
Well, then, I shouldn't
have to spell it out for you.

11:56.847 --> 12:00.017
Yeah, but you see, folks can make a
lot of money a lot of different ways.

12:00.051 --> 12:01.353
They can make money pimping hos,

12:01.385 --> 12:04.155
they can make money
killing people. They can...

12:04.188 --> 12:06.290
He sold crystal meth.

12:06.323 --> 12:08.426
Or at least worked for
the people that did.

12:08.460 --> 12:11.330
Ah-ha.

12:11.363 --> 12:16.268
And during his hard
schedule of selling drugs,

12:16.301 --> 12:19.238
he also beat you up, didn't he?

12:20.138 --> 12:22.941
Only when I was bad.

12:22.974 --> 12:25.511
Why'd you stay with him?

12:25.543 --> 12:27.946
He kept me from being bad.

12:31.416 --> 12:34.486
So what do you think
you're gonna do now?

12:34.519 --> 12:36.288
I wanna get his
car and go home,

12:36.321 --> 12:38.290
but the police
won't let me have it.

12:38.322 --> 12:41.225
And that's why you're here,
because you need a relative

12:41.259 --> 12:43.394
like a wife or someone, right?

12:45.263 --> 12:46.899
Could you get it for me?

12:47.865 --> 12:49.367
What are you talking about?

12:49.400 --> 12:51.035
His car.

12:51.068 --> 12:53.404
I have a spare set of keys.

12:56.274 --> 12:58.878
What if I give you something?

13:01.346 --> 13:04.216
I'll probably pass
on that at the moment.

13:06.884 --> 13:09.453
Ronnie had a lot of
money stashed away.

13:09.486 --> 13:12.057
How much is there?

13:12.490 --> 13:14.125
Two million.

13:15.226 --> 13:16.861
Mm-hmm.

13:18.096 --> 13:20.198
I'll give you ten percent.

13:20.231 --> 13:22.367
Technically, it's not stealing.

13:23.534 --> 13:27.139
Ten percent of
two million that's in his car.

13:27.172 --> 13:29.207
That's not stealing.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.876
- It's kind of stealing.
- But they're bad people,

13:31.909 --> 13:34.145
and they don't
deserve to get it back.

13:34.178 --> 13:37.115
What do you think's gonna
happen if we don't steal it?

13:37.148 --> 13:40.152
I think it'll go back
to Ronnie's bitches

13:40.184 --> 13:42.887
and they'll put the
drugs on the street,

13:42.921 --> 13:44.556
which means it's better
if we steal it,

13:44.589 --> 13:47.359
because at least
less people will be hurt.

13:47.392 --> 13:49.461
Precisely.

13:49.494 --> 13:51.296
Let me ask you something.

13:51.328 --> 13:53.064
You sure the money's there?

13:53.097 --> 13:57.001
He liked to brag.
Thought it got me hot.

13:57.034 --> 13:58.302
It did.

13:58.336 --> 14:01.340
Do you have any idea
what he did with the money?

14:01.373 --> 14:05.177
Once a month, he'd drop
a bunch of it off at the bank.

14:05.210 --> 14:08.013
- Do you know what bank?
- I don't know.

14:08.046 --> 14:10.282
I'd go shopping while he did it.

14:10.315 --> 14:13.085
Do you know who's money it was.

14:13.118 --> 14:18.190
Who cares? Some cowboy that
lives in Houston, Texas.

14:18.222 --> 14:20.158
They call him Mr. Vargas.

14:39.476 --> 14:42.213
- Mm-hmm.
- They're bad people.

14:42.246 --> 14:44.216
They don't deserve
to get it back.

14:44.249 --> 14:47.052
If we take it, we'd be
doing society a favor,

14:47.085 --> 14:49.655
and you would be doing your job.

15:00.264 --> 15:02.934
<i>Yeah, boss.</i>

15:02.967 --> 15:04.201
<i>He's not saying anything.</i>

15:04.235 --> 15:06.471
<i>I'm working on him all day.</i>

15:27.158 --> 15:29.528
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

15:30.528 --> 15:32.297
Hi, Mom.

15:32.330 --> 15:35.367
Yes, I know about
your doctor's appointment.

15:35.399 --> 15:37.501
You reminded me yesterday.

15:37.534 --> 15:39.404
Two o'clock, right?

15:40.371 --> 15:43.708
I'll be there at 1:30.

15:45.509 --> 15:49.181
That will give us
plenty of time.

15:49.214 --> 15:53.485
Yes, Mom. I know you like
to be there on time.

15:57.087 --> 15:58.490
Mom, listen...

16:01.558 --> 16:05.529
Alright, I'll be there
at one o'clock, okay?

16:05.562 --> 16:06.966
Good.

16:07.532 --> 16:09.634
No, I won't be late.

16:10.268 --> 16:11.537
Bye, Mom.

16:12.202 --> 16:14.072
I said bye, Mom.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.225
Hey, hey, Trevor.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.595
Trevor... Hey, wake up, man.

16:36.628 --> 16:40.299
Wake up, man.
Someone wants to talk to you.

16:41.832 --> 16:43.601
Trevor.

16:43.634 --> 16:48.105
Mr. Vargas wants you to give
back what you took from him.

16:48.139 --> 16:50.042
I swear to God, Gage,
I didn't take anything.

16:56.648 --> 16:59.618
Hey, hey, Trevor.
Trevor, hey.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.553
Wake up, man. Wake up, man.

17:03.321 --> 17:05.323
Excuse me.

17:05.355 --> 17:07.392
Hello, Mr. Vargas.

17:07.424 --> 17:09.595
Ronnie is dead.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.663
How?

17:12.695 --> 17:16.567
Got into a fight with that
girlfriend slut of his from the club.

17:16.601 --> 17:17.702
<i>Lisa killed him?</i>

17:17.733 --> 17:20.104
No, he got himself shot.

17:30.714 --> 17:33.384
We all know you took
the money, Trevor.

17:33.417 --> 17:35.152
What happened to the money?

17:35.185 --> 17:36.487
Technically, it's not stealing.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.790
Ten percent of two million
that's in his car.

17:39.824 --> 17:40.792
Precisely.

17:40.825 --> 17:42.160
I don't know.

17:42.192 --> 17:43.461
Neither does the lawyer.

17:43.494 --> 17:46.130
That's why I need you there.

17:46.163 --> 17:47.632
Okay, I'm talking to Trevor.

17:47.664 --> 17:49.835
<i>I don't
give a shit about Trevor.</i>

17:49.867 --> 17:53.337
I want you to find
the fucking money.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.596
Shh!

18:21.231 --> 18:23.902
What do you want?
We're friends, yeah?

18:23.934 --> 18:28.373
I would never take
anything from Mr. Vargas.

18:28.405 --> 18:31.242
I'd slit my own throat first.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.144
You won't have to
slit your own throat.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.714
Gage, please, I didn't do it.
I swear.

18:48.192 --> 18:49.494
Give me that.

18:51.628 --> 18:53.298
Clean this up.

18:53.330 --> 18:58.536
Hey... what was that about?

18:58.569 --> 19:00.739
Another problem.

19:00.771 --> 19:02.206
Oh, yeah?

19:02.240 --> 19:06.178
- Listen, I gotta ask you a favor.
- Sure.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.346
My mother has a doctor's
appointment at two o' clock.

19:09.380 --> 19:12.417
- I'm supposed to take her.
- No problem.

19:12.450 --> 19:15.819
Make sure you get there early.
She can't stand to be late.

19:15.853 --> 19:18.957
And, uh, tell her
I'll call her tonight.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.791
Sure thing, boss.

19:22.894 --> 19:24.930
- What?
- Nothing.

19:30.969 --> 19:32.504
What?

19:33.605 --> 19:34.806
You think he did it?

19:34.838 --> 19:36.407
No.

19:36.441 --> 19:39.411
So why'd you uh...

19:40.444 --> 19:42.847
- It's my job.
- Yeah.

19:44.315 --> 19:47.419
In this business,
you're either the guy

19:47.451 --> 19:50.622
hanging somebody
from the ceiling

19:50.654 --> 19:53.591
or you're the guy
hanging from the ceiling.

21:12.970 --> 21:15.539
- Nice ride.
- Thank you, babe.

21:15.573 --> 21:18.442
- On a cop's pension.
- What pension?

21:20.377 --> 21:23.814
- So where are we going?
- Back to my apartment.

21:24.816 --> 21:25.917
Wait, I thought you said

21:25.950 --> 21:27.719
we were gonna go get the money.

21:27.751 --> 21:31.889
Money's in the car, and the
car's in the impound lot, right?

21:31.923 --> 21:33.625
You don't have a plan, do you?

21:33.657 --> 21:36.060
Yeah, my plan is
to go get the money.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.462
You're gonna stroll into the
impound lot and take the money?

21:38.496 --> 21:41.432
- Yeah, I am.
- Yeah, I'd like to see that.

21:41.465 --> 21:45.636
You're about to.
You're about to.

22:00.951 --> 22:04.588
Why don't we stay in my office?

22:16.933 --> 22:18.636
We're good here.

22:27.010 --> 22:28.413
I knew you were in town,

22:28.445 --> 22:31.515
but I didn't know
you were coming here.

22:31.548 --> 22:33.652
Surprise.

22:34.652 --> 22:35.886
Oh, well.

22:37.788 --> 22:40.057
I'm to understand
Mr. Vargas is concerned about...

22:40.090 --> 22:43.661
Hey, that's my dog!

22:49.866 --> 22:52.036
I understand Mr. Vargas
is concerned about...

22:52.068 --> 22:54.538
He wants his money back.

22:54.571 --> 22:56.006
I tried to do everything I can

22:56.039 --> 22:57.908
to understand what happened
after all these things.

22:57.942 --> 23:02.846
The only thing that matters
to Mr. Vargas is results.

23:02.880 --> 23:07.786
Trying... well,
it just gets you killed.

23:09.453 --> 23:12.423
- I've got some preliminary...
- Where's Ronnie's car?

23:12.457 --> 23:15.059
The police have it.
I believe at the impound lot.

23:15.092 --> 23:19.063
You believe?
You believe or you're sure?

23:19.096 --> 23:20.632
I'm sure.

23:22.633 --> 23:23.802
Did they find the money?

23:23.835 --> 23:26.604
I believe... No, no.
They have not.

23:26.636 --> 23:27.938
When can we have the car back?

23:27.971 --> 23:30.008
I spoke to the
man who oversees...

23:30.040 --> 23:32.743
- When?
- Tomorrow.

23:33.577 --> 23:35.012
Why not today?

23:35.046 --> 23:37.182
'Cause the captain
leaves at five.

23:37.214 --> 23:40.717
He can't be the only
one who can release a car.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.988
To next of kin. He wants to see
a power of attorney,

23:44.020 --> 23:47.090
signed by Mr. Martin's wife,
authorizing...

23:47.124 --> 23:49.059
Tell him I'm Ronnie's brother.

23:49.093 --> 23:52.130
Unless you have a driver's
license in the name of Martin,

23:52.163 --> 23:53.664
I'm afraid we'll have to wait.

23:53.698 --> 23:55.633
Then I wanna know
everything there is to know

23:55.665 --> 23:57.469
about the man who shot Ronnie.

23:57.501 --> 23:59.471
They haven't released his name.

23:59.503 --> 24:01.071
- But they will.
- Of course.

24:01.105 --> 24:03.508
But I believe not until morning.

24:10.948 --> 24:13.652
You have two hours.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.990
Two hours, it's...

24:19.022 --> 24:23.060
By the way, you just
stepped in dog shit.

24:26.564 --> 24:28.099
Surprise.

24:36.941 --> 24:41.679
<i>Okay, so what's
this plan of yours?</i>

24:41.711 --> 24:45.717
First, I need you to tell me
exactly where the money is.

24:45.750 --> 24:50.888
<i>It's in a black 2013 Jaguar XF.</i>

24:51.821 --> 24:53.156
<i>It has to be guarded.</i>

24:53.190 --> 24:55.660
<i>Oh, it is guarded, darling.</i>

24:55.692 --> 24:56.994
<i>It's guarded.</i>

24:57.028 --> 24:58.529
<i>The money's in the trunk,</i>

24:58.563 --> 25:00.031
<i>underneath a bunch of junk.</i>

25:00.064 --> 25:03.868
It's all there.
Two million, cash.

25:03.901 --> 25:05.871
I hope you're right.

25:06.938 --> 25:09.040
Is that a real badge?

25:09.073 --> 25:12.277
Sure enough it is.

25:12.309 --> 25:15.245
Listen, I spent a long
time in the military

25:15.278 --> 25:17.848
and a long time
in law enforcement.

25:17.882 --> 25:20.151
<i>I can make this happen.</i>

25:20.183 --> 25:23.887
<i>I really can,
if you listen to me.</i>

25:23.921 --> 25:27.725
<i>I've got a plan.
You gotta do everything I say.</i>

25:27.758 --> 25:31.194
<i>If you go off the res,
you will fuck shit up</i>

25:31.228 --> 25:34.798
<i>and get us caught
or killed, alright?</i>

25:36.601 --> 25:39.237
Even if this shit looks
like it's going sideways,

25:39.269 --> 25:41.605
it ain't, I promise you.

25:41.638 --> 25:44.107
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

25:44.141 --> 25:46.110
All right.

25:46.143 --> 25:49.948
Now, there's gonna be
one cop in the office.

25:49.980 --> 25:53.317
<i>He'll have a manifest for all
the impounds as well as the keys.</i>

25:53.351 --> 25:56.220
<i>But I told you,
I have a set of keys.</i>

25:56.252 --> 25:59.758
<i>And that's why he ain't
never gonna see me.</i>

26:02.859 --> 26:05.096
I got the guy's name.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.129
Michael Decker.

26:06.163 --> 26:09.800
8965 Rue Monge.
Apartment 74.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.102
<i>That was fast.</i>

26:11.134 --> 26:12.936
<i>Wait, there's some more.</i>

26:12.970 --> 26:13.741
More?

26:13.742 --> 26:16.642
He's an American,
used to be a federal agent.

26:16.673 --> 26:18.276
Can you believe it, DEA?

26:20.176 --> 26:21.911
Shit, that's not good.

26:21.945 --> 26:25.849
<i>Used to be, because he was forced
to retire without benefits.</i>

26:25.883 --> 26:28.186
I don't need to hear
his life story, man.

26:28.219 --> 26:31.823
Without benefits
means no pension.

26:31.855 --> 26:33.095
<i>So they guy needs money?</i>

26:33.124 --> 26:34.959
A lot of
accommodations and a lot

26:34.991 --> 26:37.861
of dead drug dealers.
The guy is dangerous.

26:37.894 --> 26:40.131
Okay, what do we do now?

26:41.665 --> 26:43.233
We wait.

26:43.267 --> 26:44.369
We wait?

26:45.836 --> 26:47.337
That's the plan?

26:47.371 --> 26:49.941
- You know why?
- Why?

26:49.973 --> 26:52.843
Because it's about to get dark,

26:52.876 --> 26:55.913
and you understand
something, sweetheart?

26:55.945 --> 26:58.982
Darkness is our friend.

26:59.983 --> 27:04.054
<i>Oh, yeah,
darkness is our friend.</i>

27:16.467 --> 27:18.803
<i>Ronnie had money, too.</i>

27:18.836 --> 27:20.104
A lot of money.

27:20.136 --> 27:22.139
<i>I wanna get his car
and go home,</i>

27:22.173 --> 27:25.876
<i>but the police
won't let me have it.</i>

27:25.910 --> 27:27.412
<i>Could you get it for me?</i>

27:27.444 --> 27:30.114
<i>I'll probably
pass on that at the moment.</i>

27:30.146 --> 27:32.951
What if I give you something?

27:57.273 --> 27:58.842
What time is it?

27:59.777 --> 28:01.712
Well, I'd say it's time for me

28:01.746 --> 28:03.381
to tell you that I'm in.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.717
Wow.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.051
I must have been good.

28:08.085 --> 28:10.855
You were really, really good,

28:11.855 --> 28:15.792
but I'd like to be partners.

28:15.826 --> 28:17.228
For half.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.329
- Half?
- Yeah.

28:20.798 --> 28:24.035
- I'm not that good.
- Really, really good.

28:25.269 --> 28:26.805
That okay?

28:29.140 --> 28:31.776
- Okay.
- All right.

28:35.479 --> 28:38.950
You weren't so bad
yourself, Decker.

29:10.346 --> 29:12.783
So when are you going back?

29:12.817 --> 29:18.356
Well, the graveyard guy
comes in about 10:30,

29:18.390 --> 29:23.261
so I'll go in around 11 or so,
give him time to get to sleep.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.062
You're funny.

29:25.095 --> 29:26.364
You know what,
you're not gonna be able

29:26.396 --> 29:28.231
to go back after this,
don't forget that.

29:28.265 --> 29:29.534
Yeah, you already said,

29:29.567 --> 29:32.202
but what about my apartment,
all of my stuff?

29:32.236 --> 29:35.940
Million dollar
buy a lot of shit, baby.

29:38.174 --> 29:39.376
What about you?

29:39.410 --> 29:41.946
I'm gonna have to
disappear, you know.

29:41.979 --> 29:44.515
Before the police start
coming look for me saying,

29:44.548 --> 29:46.450
"Man, you know, I think
the guy who shot Ronnie

29:46.482 --> 29:48.952
is the same motherfucker
that broke into this car

29:48.986 --> 29:49.946
and stole all the money.

29:51.521 --> 29:53.924
If you say so.

29:55.125 --> 29:57.127
So where are you
gonna disappear to?

29:57.161 --> 29:58.830
I got a friend,
lives down in Key West.

29:58.863 --> 30:02.266
He's trying to
set me up down there.

30:02.298 --> 30:05.435
- Maybe it's time to go home.
- Florida?

30:05.469 --> 30:08.005
I've never been to the States.

30:08.038 --> 30:10.008
Maybe I can come with you.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.344
Come on.

30:14.244 --> 30:15.512
Pretty please?

30:17.013 --> 30:19.516
I promise I'll behave.

30:19.549 --> 30:23.354
Unless you don't
want me to... behave.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.457
Let me think about that.

30:26.490 --> 30:29.393
Why won't you take me with you?

30:29.425 --> 30:32.195
I mean, I just don't
know why you'd wanna come.

30:32.229 --> 30:33.463
I'll just wait in the car.

30:33.497 --> 30:35.499
Because you'll wanna help,
right? Is that it?

30:35.531 --> 30:37.367
Yes, I want to help.

30:37.401 --> 30:40.571
I'll probably be a lot
better off without you.

30:40.604 --> 30:41.972
You know...

30:42.940 --> 30:45.643
And, uh, waiting in the car,

30:45.675 --> 30:48.545
I don't think
it's gonna help anybody.

30:49.946 --> 30:51.181
I think you wanna
do it just to keep

30:51.214 --> 30:53.216
an eye on me, is that right?

30:53.250 --> 30:55.619
It's not that.
It's just...

30:55.653 --> 30:57.421
Then why?

30:57.453 --> 31:00.290
- It's because it's my...
- It's your money?

31:00.324 --> 31:02.393
- My idea.
- Your idea?

31:02.425 --> 31:03.627
Well, that is true,
but, you know,

31:03.661 --> 31:04.929
I'm taking a little
bit of risk here.

31:04.961 --> 31:06.096
Not if I come with you.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.431
I just think you're
gonna be in the way.

31:07.463 --> 31:09.432
And what am I supposed
to do until then?

31:09.465 --> 31:11.301
Bake cookies?

31:11.335 --> 31:13.504
I love the fuck out of cookies.

31:16.539 --> 31:18.009
Come on!

31:18.675 --> 31:20.343
I'll be your lookout.

31:20.376 --> 31:22.680
I'll bake you cookies
when we get back.

31:22.712 --> 31:24.147
Naked.

31:24.181 --> 31:25.917
I guess you don't
trust me to come back?

31:25.950 --> 31:26.683
No, I trust you.

31:26.717 --> 31:30.021
It's just, I wanna be there.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.456
If I wait here, I'll go crazy.

31:32.489 --> 31:34.225
Remember I have a plan.

31:34.258 --> 31:35.994
Believe it or not.

31:41.198 --> 31:44.067
Go pack your shit,
'cause we can't come back here.

32:14.698 --> 32:16.034
Hop in.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.676
Do you have any idea
how hard it was to find you?

32:25.709 --> 32:29.113
You still have a connection
at the phone company?

32:29.145 --> 32:31.182
Yeah, sure.

32:31.214 --> 32:35.685
I want to find out where
Ronnie's girlfriend is.

32:35.719 --> 32:38.523
- Why?
- Got a bad feeling.

33:08.085 --> 33:11.422
Alright, listen.
You're the lookout.

33:11.454 --> 33:12.575
You keep the windows cracked

33:12.588 --> 33:14.325
so you can listen
for any trouble.

33:14.357 --> 33:17.727
Don't play the radio.
Don't talk on your cell phone.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.163
That way you can hear
if someone is coming.

33:20.196 --> 33:22.532
You're expecting
someone to sneak up on me?

33:22.566 --> 33:25.269
Nah, man, I just need you to keep
your eyes and ears open.

33:25.301 --> 33:26.703
You're here to help me.

33:26.737 --> 33:29.140
It's pitch dark outside.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.508
That's our friend.

33:30.540 --> 33:33.176
Remember what I told you,
the night is our friend.

33:33.210 --> 33:35.078
Well, what do I do
if a cop drives up?

33:35.112 --> 33:36.413
Just flirt with him, man.

33:36.446 --> 33:39.216
Offer to bake him some
cookies or something.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.257
Hey, man,
what are you doing here?

36:00.289 --> 36:01.324
Me?

36:01.358 --> 36:02.860
What are you doing here, huh?

37:42.326 --> 37:43.527
Did you get it?

37:43.559 --> 37:44.961
All of it.

37:44.994 --> 37:46.963
Yeah, now you owe
me some good pussy.

37:49.699 --> 37:50.867
Can't go back to my place

37:50.900 --> 37:53.069
so we're gonna lay
up here for the night.

37:53.103 --> 37:56.639
Here?
It's not a five star, is it?

37:56.672 --> 37:59.776
Here, not even gloves come on.

38:07.117 --> 38:08.786
So now what?

38:08.818 --> 38:12.422
We hang around in this room.
Lay low for a minute.

38:13.657 --> 38:16.093
I should have kept
my room at Hotel Jolie.

38:16.126 --> 38:17.561
You should have.

38:17.594 --> 38:20.764
But you came with
a bad man like me.

38:30.740 --> 38:34.510
So, when can we get out of here?

38:34.543 --> 38:37.347
I'm just in the middle of
making some arrangements.

38:38.949 --> 38:40.784
What time is it?

38:40.817 --> 38:42.097
Time for you to see if you could

38:42.119 --> 38:44.954
close those blinds for me,
please.

38:44.987 --> 38:46.022
Yeah.

38:46.056 --> 38:47.490
<i>Trouble always starts</i>

38:47.523 --> 38:49.092
<i>when you get your hands
on the money.</i>

38:49.126 --> 38:51.829
<i>Like I said earlier,
no two people</i>

38:51.862 --> 38:53.997
<i>see the same event
the same way.</i>

38:54.030 --> 38:56.500
<i>I promise you that.</i>

38:59.902 --> 39:01.571
We're rich.

39:31.568 --> 39:32.536
What do you need?

39:32.568 --> 39:34.471
We're here for a car.

39:34.503 --> 39:37.775
- Let me guess, a black Jag?
- Yes.

39:37.807 --> 39:40.076
An asshole stuck in last
night and broke into it.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.481
He beat the hell out
of couple of guards.

39:44.146 --> 39:45.581
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

39:45.614 --> 39:47.016
What the hell
is his problem, huh?

39:47.050 --> 39:48.118
This is a release signed

39:48.150 --> 39:50.620
by Captain Dardou this morning.

39:55.759 --> 39:57.661
I don't care,
the car is evidence now.

39:57.693 --> 39:59.128
This was signed an hour ago.

39:59.161 --> 40:01.164
Unless the break in
you mentioned

40:01.197 --> 40:03.166
was more recent than that.

40:03.199 --> 40:06.769
This authorization
supersedes any need you have

40:06.802 --> 40:09.038
of the vehicle as evidence.

40:12.842 --> 40:14.511
Who the hell are you?

40:27.990 --> 40:29.492
Motherfucker.

40:29.525 --> 40:30.693
Who do you think?

40:30.726 --> 40:32.028
Lisa.

40:32.061 --> 40:33.663
Ronnie's girlfriend?

40:33.697 --> 40:35.465
She's the only one who knew.

40:35.498 --> 40:38.568
- And Decker?
- Definitely.

40:38.601 --> 40:41.471
But he's not an agent anymore.

40:56.952 --> 40:59.989
I'll be right back.

41:00.023 --> 41:02.559
Can you bring me
back some breakfast?

41:02.592 --> 41:03.794
I can.

41:11.034 --> 41:12.669
Are you taking the money?

41:12.702 --> 41:14.738
Just a little bit.

41:14.771 --> 41:16.673
It would be safer here.

41:16.706 --> 41:18.675
It's safe with you
and even safer with me,

41:18.708 --> 41:20.577
'cause I got the gun.

41:20.610 --> 41:23.247
- You don't trust me?
- I do.

41:26.282 --> 41:29.219
Trust isn't an
all or nothing proposition.

41:29.251 --> 41:31.288
It takes time to grow.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.761
We got a decent start,

41:34.762 --> 41:38.762
but we've only known each
other for about 30 hours.

41:38.795 --> 41:41.532
- So you don't trust me.
- I do trust you.

41:43.632 --> 41:46.802
Why don't you stay?
You don't have to go.

41:46.835 --> 41:50.072
I will be right back,
and here's the thing:

41:50.106 --> 41:51.608
I've got a plan.

41:51.641 --> 41:56.113
It's an unusual plan,
but I got your back.

41:56.780 --> 41:58.282
You'll see.

41:58.315 --> 42:00.251
You'll see what I got.

42:17.032 --> 42:18.735
He's here, boss.

42:54.971 --> 42:57.574
Antoine, Plummer.

43:00.876 --> 43:02.746
What's with the hat?

43:04.681 --> 43:08.885
Mr. Vargas said you need help,
going up against some American.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.021
Yes, I do.

43:24.034 --> 43:25.635
Who's this fool?

43:26.670 --> 43:28.872
He's my cousin, Pee Wee.

43:31.240 --> 43:34.043
- No shit?
- Really.

43:34.077 --> 43:36.213
- Yep.
- Alright.

43:37.681 --> 43:39.048
Come on, get in.

43:42.085 --> 43:43.387
Hey, stupid.

43:44.820 --> 43:46.656
Lose the hat.

44:08.010 --> 44:13.150
Well, this is the address
Chauvin gave us: Michael Decker.

44:17.987 --> 44:19.722
Lose the fucking hat.

45:18.380 --> 45:20.250
Check the bathroom.

45:51.079 --> 45:53.250
What do you got for me?

45:55.818 --> 45:58.822
Great, thanks.

46:00.056 --> 46:02.324
Tell me.

46:02.358 --> 46:04.294
It was my guy from
the phone company.

46:04.327 --> 46:07.097
That bitch used her cell
phone 20 minutes ago.

46:07.130 --> 46:09.800
- Where?
- Chef Monteur at Rue Galmain.

46:09.833 --> 46:13.771
Google shows a little fleabag
hotel out... out that way.

46:15.271 --> 46:16.539
Wait for me.

46:42.164 --> 46:46.836
Hey, I need two tickets
out of here tomorrow morning.

46:46.869 --> 46:48.971
If my plan comes together.

46:49.005 --> 46:50.574
Of course, what's going on?

46:50.606 --> 46:52.074
I don't know, man.

46:52.108 --> 46:55.077
Key West sounds good and warm,
doesn't it?

46:56.346 --> 46:57.847
So you need an exit route.

46:57.880 --> 47:03.319
<i>Well, I'll call you back
within 24 hours to confirm.</i>

47:05.989 --> 47:08.492
I miss you, too, brother.

47:53.302 --> 47:54.471
Bonjour.

47:54.503 --> 47:56.306
I'm looking for
a man and a woman.

47:56.338 --> 48:00.175
He looks like a cop,
she looks like a stripper.

48:00.208 --> 48:03.980
Sorry, but I cannot
help you with that.

48:04.012 --> 48:08.684
- See that wall behind you?
- Oui.

48:08.717 --> 48:10.686
It will be splattered
with your fucking brains

48:10.719 --> 48:14.957
if the next words out of your
mouth aren't a room number.

48:31.606 --> 48:34.177
372, third floor.

48:34.210 --> 48:36.079
<i>Third, trois.</i>

48:41.351 --> 48:42.452
Hey!

48:43.485 --> 48:44.987
Put that down.

48:46.989 --> 48:48.457
Put it down.

48:50.693 --> 48:52.595
They don't have enough
cops in this city

48:52.628 --> 48:55.231
to stop me from killing you.

49:33.402 --> 49:35.771
I'll knock.
Luc, cover me.

49:35.804 --> 49:38.440
And you keep that thing put
away until we get inside.

49:38.474 --> 49:40.176
Yeah, but what
if he moves on me.

49:40.208 --> 49:43.746
You let me and Luc
worry about that.

49:43.780 --> 49:46.249
You just shut the door behind us

49:46.282 --> 49:51.088
- and keep your eyes open, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

50:01.297 --> 50:02.731
Got my breakfast?

50:06.202 --> 50:08.071
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

50:10.672 --> 50:12.408
Check the bathroom.

50:12.442 --> 50:14.077
Pull that shut.

50:14.110 --> 50:16.378
Where's the money?

50:16.411 --> 50:18.614
I don't know what
you're talking about.

50:21.583 --> 50:22.752
Okay.

50:24.387 --> 50:26.756
I'll ask you again.

50:26.789 --> 50:31.561
Only this time,
if I don't get an answer,

50:31.594 --> 50:35.798
this gun will be the
last fucking thing

50:35.831 --> 50:38.333
you will ever have the pleasure

50:38.367 --> 50:42.706
of wrapping your luscious
lips around, hmm?

50:47.275 --> 50:48.811
Where's the money?

51:01.590 --> 51:03.293
Is that him calling?

51:04.159 --> 51:05.461
I don't know.

51:05.494 --> 51:07.197
You don't know.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.231
See what number it is.

51:14.769 --> 51:16.206
They hung up.

51:16.239 --> 51:17.706
Give it here.

51:26.349 --> 51:28.117
Let me see.

51:42.565 --> 51:44.267
Yeah.

51:44.300 --> 51:45.502
That was him.

51:48.371 --> 51:49.840
Where is he now?

51:50.706 --> 51:52.742
How am I supposed to know?

51:52.775 --> 51:54.244
Merci.

51:58.481 --> 52:00.784
- Bonjour.
- I'll have a juice.

52:13.563 --> 52:15.265
Boss, found it.

52:16.231 --> 52:17.800
Holy shit!

52:19.568 --> 52:20.804
Move away.

52:42.358 --> 52:44.327
Where's the rest of the money?

52:45.695 --> 52:47.197
I don't know.

52:50.465 --> 52:51.800
Keep looking.

52:56.271 --> 52:57.574
Where's Decker?

52:57.606 --> 52:59.543
I don't know.

53:14.956 --> 53:19.328
You are starting to bore
the hell out of me, Lisa.

55:03.599 --> 55:05.902
Get out of the car.
Take the bag.

55:18.713 --> 55:19.916
What's going on?

55:19.949 --> 55:21.851
Where's Pee Wee?

55:21.884 --> 55:24.353
Dead, same as Luc.

55:27.088 --> 55:30.360
- What do you mean, dead?
- I mean dead.

55:30.393 --> 55:34.429
- Like he ain't breathing.
- What the fuck?

55:34.463 --> 55:38.000
Exactly, he fucked up, and he
got himself fucking killed.

55:38.032 --> 55:40.336
What the...

55:51.547 --> 55:53.349
Here's 30,000.

55:54.416 --> 55:55.851
Take it.

55:55.885 --> 56:00.557
Bury your fucking Pee-Wee
and keep what's left.

56:01.657 --> 56:05.394
He was not my
favorite cousin, you know.

56:18.807 --> 56:20.409
Get the girl.

57:14.864 --> 57:17.500
Gage, do you
know what time it is here?

57:17.532 --> 57:19.067
Sorry sir. It's just that...

57:19.101 --> 57:23.506
<i>I said, do you
know what time it is here?</i>

57:23.539 --> 57:24.807
It's late, sir.

57:24.840 --> 57:29.077
Yes, late, Gage,
which means this better be good.

57:29.110 --> 57:31.012
I've located your money, sir.

57:31.045 --> 57:32.748
<i>Good start.</i>

57:32.780 --> 57:35.684
<i>A better start would be to
say you have my money, Gage.</i>

57:35.717 --> 57:37.920
<i>- That would be better.
- I have half of it.</i>

57:37.952 --> 57:40.655
I'm about to get the other half.

57:40.688 --> 57:43.158
Then I would
say this very late phone call

57:43.192 --> 57:46.027
is very premature,
wouldn't you say?

57:46.061 --> 57:47.730
<i>I'm not calling
you about the status</i>

57:47.762 --> 57:49.699
<i>of your money, Mr. Vargas.</i>

57:49.731 --> 57:52.802
Then why the
fuck are you calling, Gage?

57:52.835 --> 57:55.237
'Cause I want to tell you that
the man who has the other half

57:55.271 --> 57:58.875
is a former
DEA agent from Texas.

57:59.842 --> 58:01.711
<i>Michael Decker.</i>

58:01.744 --> 58:03.679
<i>Does the name ring a bell?</i>

58:03.711 --> 58:05.181
- Gage?
- Yes, sir.

58:05.213 --> 58:07.849
<i>Get my money
from this Michael Decker.</i>

58:07.882 --> 58:09.818
<i>I don't expect to
speak to you again</i>

58:09.851 --> 58:14.190
<i>until this entire unfortunate
incident has been resolved.</i>

58:14.222 --> 58:16.692
One way or another.

58:35.744 --> 58:37.646
Where's the rest of the money?

58:37.679 --> 58:39.548
He took it with him.

58:39.581 --> 58:40.717
Where?

58:41.849 --> 58:43.952
I don't know.

58:54.996 --> 58:59.902
I don't like killing women,
but I'll do it if I have to.

59:07.976 --> 59:10.112
He's going to Key West.

59:11.914 --> 59:13.349
<i>Key West?</i>

59:13.382 --> 59:16.853
<i>Key West is a little
far from Paris.</i>

59:18.853 --> 59:21.857
What if I can get
him to come back?

59:22.925 --> 59:24.160
How?

59:24.994 --> 59:26.963
I'll call him.

59:26.996 --> 59:30.132
Why would he answer your call?

59:30.164 --> 59:32.568
Why do you think?

59:48.016 --> 59:51.086
He took half the money
with him.

59:52.186 --> 59:54.856
He didn't trust me to hold it.

59:54.889 --> 59:56.725
Smart man.

59:56.759 --> 59:59.695
<i>I was going
with him to Key West.</i>

59:59.728 --> 01:00:01.864
<i>I figured somewhere
along the way,</i>

01:00:01.896 --> 01:00:04.266
<i>I could get the rest of
the money and ditch him.</i>

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.669
You wanted it all, huh?

01:00:07.702 --> 01:00:13.275
- Not for me, for Mr. Vargas.
- Mr. Vargas?

01:00:13.307 --> 01:00:15.677
You went to all this
trouble for Mr. Vargas.

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:18.913
I went to all this trouble
to get him off my back.

01:00:18.947 --> 01:00:20.682
I promised Decker ten percent,

01:00:20.715 --> 01:00:24.186
and a great piece of ass
if he helped me.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.056
Ten percent?

01:00:27.088 --> 01:00:28.289
I don't think
he did it for the money,

01:00:28.322 --> 01:00:30.626
if you know what I mean.

01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:34.262
He stole money from us,

01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:37.198
and then he stole
half of it again from you.

01:00:37.231 --> 01:00:40.268
I think you got it wrong.

01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:42.171
You'll never
understand this, Gage,

01:00:42.204 --> 01:00:44.907
but Decker
could have taken it all.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.208
He didn't.

01:00:46.974 --> 01:00:48.710
He's a decent guy.

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.818
I'll tell him
you're gonna kill me

01:00:55.851 --> 01:00:58.221
if he doesn't
bring back the money.

01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:36.425
Make the call.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.006
Michael.

01:01:51.773 --> 01:01:53.442
Well, you better come inside.

01:01:53.474 --> 01:01:55.777
Jean is waiting for you.

01:02:03.952 --> 01:02:06.856
<i>Decker, leave a message.</i>

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.825
Michael, it's Lisa.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.428
<i>Look, you're a decent man.</i>

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.096
<i>I know you are
and I'm begging you</i>

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.333
<i>to please help me.</i>

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.538
<i>They want the money back,
not us.</i>

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:25.440
<i>Everything can go back
to the way it was.</i>

01:02:25.474 --> 01:02:28.443
<i>We can still go to Key West,
just like we planned.</i>

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:33.916
If they don't get
the money back, Michael,

01:02:36.518 --> 01:02:39.088
they're gonna kill me.

01:02:43.358 --> 01:02:45.161
Please, help me.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.135
Convincing?

01:03:06.081 --> 01:03:09.117
This Mr. Vargas
is an evil man, Michael.

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:12.221
Hiding with the Sinaloa Cartel,

01:03:12.253 --> 01:03:14.289
not much of a footprint
here, you know,

01:03:14.322 --> 01:03:16.192
but most definitely on the radar

01:03:16.224 --> 01:03:20.096
of some of your former friends
in the DEA back home.

01:03:28.637 --> 01:03:30.840
Probably the FBI, as well.

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:32.907
He's one of the bad guys.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.411
Well, we love to
get rid of the bad guys.

01:03:37.579 --> 01:03:39.114
We really do.

01:03:39.146 --> 01:03:41.516
I don't give a fuck what
happens to the bad guys.

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:47.856
Michael... you remember this?

01:03:47.889 --> 01:03:49.458
I sure enough do.

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:51.259
How could I forget?

01:03:54.161 --> 01:03:57.532
It would have been a lot worse

01:03:57.565 --> 01:03:59.500
had you not taken
the second bullet for me.

01:03:59.534 --> 01:04:01.269
I owe you my life.

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:05.007
It ain't nothing, man, really.

01:04:05.039 --> 01:04:07.643
<i>- We're even.
- No, no, no, mon ami.</i>

01:04:09.244 --> 01:04:12.347
I get to say
when we're even, not you.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.482
That's the way it works.

01:04:19.588 --> 01:04:22.291
<i>Michael, it's Lisa.</i>

01:04:24.092 --> 01:04:26.628
<i>Look, you're a decent man,
I know you are,</i>

01:04:26.661 --> 01:04:30.398
<i>and I'm begging you
to please, help me.</i>

01:04:31.532 --> 01:04:35.003
<i>They want the money back,
not us.</i>

01:04:35.036 --> 01:04:38.139
<i>Everything could...</i>

01:04:43.545 --> 01:04:44.680
You think he'll show?

01:04:44.713 --> 01:04:46.582
What? Sure.

01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:51.553
Won't he suspect a trap?

01:04:51.585 --> 01:04:53.455
Of course he will.

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:57.592
What about me?

01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:02.030
What about you?

01:05:02.063 --> 01:05:04.165
We have a deal, right?

01:05:10.338 --> 01:05:13.643
Yeah, we have a deal.

01:05:14.976 --> 01:05:16.216
<i>See when you're forced</i>

01:05:16.244 --> 01:05:18.113
<i>to trust your partner in crime,</i>

01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:21.684
<i>in my experience, is when
things usually start to go bad.</i>

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:25.186
<i>Call it human nature
or some shit.</i>

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:32.460
<i>You ever think
about running away?</i>

01:05:32.494 --> 01:05:35.965
<i>You mean, like,
uh, to Key West?</i>

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:40.102
I hear Argentina's nice.

01:05:47.175 --> 01:05:49.679
- Is it him?
- Yep.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.548
Shouldn't I answer it?

01:05:53.581 --> 01:05:57.719
<i>- Hello, asshole.
- She all right?</i>

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:59.321
For now.

01:05:59.353 --> 01:06:00.621
<i>Let me talk to her.</i>

01:06:00.655 --> 01:06:02.490
Not until I have all the money.

01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:05.360
Y'all realize I don't
know this girl much at all.

01:06:05.393 --> 01:06:08.563
<i>You have a million
euros, you can always run.</i>

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.566
<i>That's not what I do.</i>

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:15.537
<i>- I want the rest of the money.
- I want the girl.</i>

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:19.475
- How do we do this?
- I think I'll come and get her.

01:06:19.507 --> 01:06:23.144
<i>Clichy-sous-bois
274 avenue.</i>

01:06:23.177 --> 01:06:25.580
I know where you are.

01:06:44.365 --> 01:06:49.371
So Michael, remember, the bag
without the tape has the money.

01:06:49.403 --> 01:06:52.673
The one with the tape goes boom.

01:06:52.706 --> 01:06:54.375
Right, what's the blast radius?

01:06:54.409 --> 01:06:56.746
Twenty feet, beyond that,
I'll still duck.

01:06:58.213 --> 01:06:59.348
Here.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.115
I figure you're probably
going to need

01:07:01.148 --> 01:07:05.186
<i>your favorite gun
for this one, n'est pas?</i>

01:07:05.219 --> 01:07:06.422
Thanks, what about you?

01:07:06.454 --> 01:07:09.557
Moi? I have this.

01:07:14.362 --> 01:07:16.766
Where are you two guys going?

01:07:20.367 --> 01:07:22.670
Well, like I said.

01:07:24.505 --> 01:07:26.574
I'm just taking him
out for a little lunch.

01:07:26.608 --> 01:07:29.745
- For lunch, huh?
- Yeah.

01:07:32.514 --> 01:07:34.817
<i>It was
really great to see you.</i>

01:07:35.884 --> 01:07:38.753
<i>Nice to see you.</i>

01:07:38.786 --> 01:07:42.357
<i>Make sure he comes home safe.</i>

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:44.393
I will.

01:08:05.146 --> 01:08:06.447
How far is it?

01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:08.551
It's about two blocks.

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:14.490
Where you gonna set up?

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:16.425
Somewhere they won't see me.

01:08:54.627 --> 01:08:56.363
Boss wants to speak to you.

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:59.568
- I'd like to speak to him.
- I'm gonna need your gun.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.237
Yeah, well, we all
got weapons around here.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:03.705
Unless we're gonna throw
'em all in a big pile,

01:09:03.738 --> 01:09:06.408
we're gonna have to
live with this here.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:30.166
Boss man wants you
to step out of the car.

01:09:36.371 --> 01:09:39.608
I said, get the fuck out of the car.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.710
I said back up or next time
I'm gonna fucking shoot you.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:50.752
One.

01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:55.356
<i>Deux.</i>

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:59.494
Come on, ladies,
always one more.

01:10:03.765 --> 01:10:06.335
Ah, there you are.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.782
Do I know you?

01:10:21.916 --> 01:10:23.851
I doubt it.

01:10:23.885 --> 01:10:28.523
I don't know, man.
You, uh, you look familiar.

01:10:28.555 --> 01:10:31.526
Maybe I got one of those faces.

01:10:33.994 --> 01:10:35.831
Yeah, maybe.

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:40.435
Why don't you
put your piece down.

01:10:40.467 --> 01:10:42.037
You know,
like I told your girl, man,

01:10:42.069 --> 01:10:45.006
everybody got guns
around here, man.

01:10:45.039 --> 01:10:46.975
That's the way it is.

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.312
You're surrounded.

01:10:50.345 --> 01:10:54.315
Well, it may seem
like that to you,

01:10:54.349 --> 01:10:56.952
but it might could
be an illusion.

01:10:59.654 --> 01:11:01.790
I will say this for you, man.

01:11:01.823 --> 01:11:02.958
You've got balls.

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:06.560
Well, thank you
for noticing that.

01:11:06.594 --> 01:11:09.898
My girl, here,
she knows that for a fact.

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:17.640
- Did you bring the money?
- I did.

01:12:08.422 --> 01:12:10.458
Don't open it.

01:12:11.725 --> 01:12:12.927
Put it down.

01:12:22.936 --> 01:12:24.506
Open it.

01:12:47.662 --> 01:12:48.931
Give it to me.

01:12:58.939 --> 01:13:00.442
Feels light.

01:13:00.475 --> 01:13:01.743
Well, that's kind of normal.

01:13:01.775 --> 01:13:04.613
It feels light because...

01:13:09.117 --> 01:13:10.985
I need my girl.

01:13:18.792 --> 01:13:20.429
Send me the girl.

01:13:36.677 --> 01:13:38.546
Get down.

01:13:38.579 --> 01:13:40.715
Oh, no, you don't.

01:13:40.747 --> 01:13:42.617
Get down.

01:14:17.851 --> 01:14:18.987
Gage!

01:14:23.056 --> 01:14:24.559
Stay down.

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:54.056
Lisa, get this.

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.175
Get down!

01:15:28.855 --> 01:15:30.125
Decker!

01:15:55.949 --> 01:15:58.153
Okay, you son of a bitch.

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:09.324
Turn around, drop the bag,
and kick it to me.

01:17:32.846 --> 01:17:35.349
Why'd you come back?

01:17:35.382 --> 01:17:38.252
You could have walked away
with a million in cash.

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:41.890
I'm not all about the money.
I'm all about the honor.

01:17:42.489 --> 01:17:44.958
You're an honorable man.

01:17:44.992 --> 01:17:46.293
I respect that.

01:17:47.427 --> 01:17:49.764
But in this business,
you're either

01:17:49.796 --> 01:17:52.000
the guy hanging somebody
from the ceiling...

01:17:52.033 --> 01:17:53.368
Or the guy hanging
from the ceiling.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.069
You know, I used to hear that

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:57.105
back at headquarters
once in a while,

01:17:57.137 --> 01:18:00.975
which reminds me, now that we've
had all the shit out the bag,

01:18:01.007 --> 01:18:02.943
I do remember you,
you were Danny's CI.

01:18:02.976 --> 01:18:07.114
You were Danny's high level CI.
Ain't that right?

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:08.850
Piece of advice.

01:18:10.784 --> 01:18:14.221
The dark side, doesn't suit you.

01:18:14.255 --> 01:18:16.123
I agree with you.

01:18:16.157 --> 01:18:19.761
Sounds like we both
used to work for assholes.

01:18:19.793 --> 01:18:21.296
That's for sure.

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:38.413
Rest of the money's
in the trunk.

01:18:38.445 --> 01:18:42.350
My end was five percent,
I've already taken that out.

01:18:42.382 --> 01:18:45.252
And you're giving me the rest.

01:19:49.182 --> 01:19:50.952
- Thanks.
- You all right?

01:19:50.984 --> 01:19:52.286
Yeah, it's bad enough,

01:19:52.319 --> 01:19:55.122
but if I get to a hospital
I think I'll live.

01:19:57.257 --> 01:19:59.860
Long night, huh?

01:19:59.894 --> 01:20:02.130
- Yeah.
- Give me the money.

01:20:02.162 --> 01:20:04.264
I gather Key West
is off the table.

01:20:04.297 --> 01:20:07.034
That money's mine,
and there's not enough to share.

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:09.470
Not with you or anyone else.

01:20:09.502 --> 01:20:12.606
I, uh, risked my life for you.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.311
Just on the odd
chance you might see

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:20.448
there's somebody out
there who's not bad,

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.018
who's not crooked,
who's straight up.

01:20:24.051 --> 01:20:27.521
I don't really care about money.

01:20:27.555 --> 01:20:30.024
I care about honor,

01:20:30.056 --> 01:20:32.193
and no matter how this goes,

01:20:32.225 --> 01:20:35.195
at least I showed you that.

01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:40.168
The real treasure in life
are people who love you,

01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:42.971
who are willing to die for you.

01:20:44.037 --> 01:20:46.573
See you in the next life.

01:20:56.516 --> 01:20:59.987
I'm really sorry
it turned out like this.

01:21:00.453 --> 01:21:02.056
I really am.

01:21:10.297 --> 01:21:14.501
You know what
a friend of mine used to say?

01:21:14.534 --> 01:21:17.070
Never trust a stripper.

01:21:17.104 --> 01:21:18.405
The only thing she really wants

01:21:18.439 --> 01:21:22.443
to see coming out of
your pants is your money.

01:21:22.475 --> 01:21:25.045
You smart mouthed
motherfucker, you.

01:21:25.078 --> 01:21:29.049
Can we go now? I really think
I need to see a doctor.

01:22:09.055 --> 01:22:11.591
I finally get to take
a bullet for you.

01:22:11.625 --> 01:22:15.262
You're a funny motherfucker,
too, hey?

01:22:15.296 --> 01:22:16.664
How you holding up?

01:22:16.697 --> 01:22:19.667
I'll make it,
just roll me to the ER.

01:22:19.699 --> 01:22:21.501
I'll have them call Delphine

01:22:21.534 --> 01:22:25.472
and I'll tell her,
I get drunk and robbed.

01:22:25.506 --> 01:22:28.276
You're an asshole.

01:22:28.309 --> 01:22:30.645
Well, I'll make sure
you're taken care of.

01:22:30.677 --> 01:22:32.346
Don't be an idiot.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.016
You need to be gone
and stay gone.

01:22:35.048 --> 01:22:37.652
Key West, remember?
I already got you the ticket.

01:22:40.253 --> 01:22:44.158
Did you stash the rest of
that money back to my place?

01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:48.095
I did, it's in a garbage can
outside the back door.

01:22:48.128 --> 01:22:50.131
Mmm, how much?

01:22:50.163 --> 01:22:52.032
Five hundred thou.

01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:59.506
<i>Oui.
Now we're even, mon ami.</i>

01:23:37.344 --> 01:23:39.780
<i>So once again,
the real treasures in life</i>

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:42.182
<i>are all about
the people who love you,</i>

01:23:42.216 --> 01:23:44.419
<i>that are willing to
take a bullet for you.</i>

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:47.588
<i>If it's all about the money,
you're bound to find yourself</i>

01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:49.323
<i>at the end of a gun.</i>

01:23:53.327 --> 01:23:54.496
Decker.

01:23:57.332 --> 01:24:00.668
<i>Decker, Decker, Decker!
Where have you been?</i>

01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:04.639
<i>I've been calling you for the
last couple of days and nothing?</i>

01:24:04.671 --> 01:24:06.807
<i>We're back at Chateau tonight.</i>

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:09.044
<i>Are you coming?</i>

01:24:10.305 --> 01:24:16.480
