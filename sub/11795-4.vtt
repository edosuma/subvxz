00:03.670 --> 00:06.673
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>

00:06.705 --> 00:09.776

00:09.809 --> 00:12.712

<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:18.778 --> 01:21.114
 I am in a great mood.

01:21.147 --> 01:22.248
   Driver's Ed starts today,

01:22.282 --> 01:25.318
 and that means I'm inches away
 from driving, cruising,

01:25.352 --> 01:26.753
   and better yet, parking.

01:26.786 --> 01:28.254
   Hi, Zack.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.957
 And speaking of parking...
 ooh.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.795
  Kelly, I got you a present.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.100
A ring?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.902
  Zack, we're just dating.
  I'm not ready to go steady.

01:42.936 --> 01:43.970
 I know that.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.972
  This is just
  a friendship ring,

01:46.006 --> 01:50.176
  'cause friendship is the boat
  that happy people sail on.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.112
   You sound like
   a Hallmark card.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.680
 Well, that's where I read it.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.385
 That is so sweet. Is there
 anything nice I
 can do for you?

01:58.418 --> 02:00.887
 Well, do the words,
 ''Lay a big one on me, baby,''

02:00.920 --> 02:02.422
 mean anything to you?

02:02.455 --> 02:05.825
 Yes, they do.
 Why don't we start with this?

02:09.395 --> 02:11.865
   -Wow!
   -You're welcome.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.402
   -What a kiss.
   -Morning, Morris.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.804
   Morning, my love.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.139
 ( sighs ) No.

02:21.808 --> 02:25.145
 Screech, you don't have
 to wear that for Driver's Ed.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.184
I take driving
very seriously.

02:31.217 --> 02:34.287
Besides,
it keeps the football team
from giving me noogies.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.958
   Slater,
   see that friendship ring
   I gave Kelly?

02:38.992 --> 02:42.228
  From now on,
  it's Kelly and Zack,
  exclusive.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.465
  I guess that means
  more babes for us.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.467
 Yeah, right.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.370
  Ow!

02:50.403 --> 02:52.939
Cheap Japanese helmet!

02:53.907 --> 02:55.975
-( bell rings )
-Okay,

02:56.009 --> 02:58.745
   let's start
   our engines of curiosity.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.747
 Vroom, vroom, vroom!

03:03.350 --> 03:05.752
Screech, what is this?

03:05.785 --> 03:08.388
A car.

03:08.421 --> 03:11.791
   Wrong. It's a responsibility
   and a privilege.

03:11.825 --> 03:15.061
   You'll never
   drive unless you learn
   to operate it correctly.

03:15.061 --> 03:18.932
 Come on, Mr. Tuttle,
 any yo-yo can learn to drive.

03:18.965 --> 03:21.368
 And perhaps that's
 why you're here, Mr. Morris.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.072
   Oh, ho, ho,
   I love hecklers.

03:26.106 --> 03:29.209
   Now, Jessie,
   what's the speed limit
   on most freeways?

03:29.242 --> 03:31.478
 You know this one, you know
 this one, you know this one.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.346
  55 miles per hour.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.282
   Excellent!
   I wish you were my child!

03:36.316 --> 03:40.120
  Now, can you pass someone
  over a double yellow line?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.088
-Kelly.
-No, you can't.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.190
 This is why
 I went into teaching!

03:44.224 --> 03:46.159
Okay, Lisa, listen up.

03:46.192 --> 03:49.929
   Why do you put your left arm
   straight out the window?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.365
  That's easy.
  To dry your nails.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.201
   N-O, no.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.370
   It's to make a left turn.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.507
   Okay, time to drive forward!
   Vroom, vroom, vroom.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.777
  Zack, what is the correct
  driving position?

04:03.810 --> 04:08.048
 Well, sir, for me it's
 one hand on the wheel,
  one arm around Kelly.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.417
 Zack!

04:10.450 --> 04:13.319
   Mr. Tuttle, sir, the correct
   driving position

04:13.353 --> 04:15.255
  is the left hand at 10:00,

04:15.288 --> 04:16.856
  and the right hand at 2:00.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.125
   That way you'll have
   full control of your car.

04:19.159 --> 04:22.195
 Mr. Slater,
 my brain salutes you!

04:23.163 --> 04:24.564
Teacher's pet.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.167
 But you're the one who belongs
 on a leash, Mr. Morris.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.504
 My dad taught me
 how to drive on an Army base.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.307
  Isn't that great?
  Slater knows how to drive.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.475
   Big deal.

04:35.508 --> 04:40.347
Yeah,
my dad let me back the car
out of the garage once.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.083
Then he got mad at me.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.218
 Well, Screech, your father
 was probably nervous.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.854
   He had a right to be.
   I forgot to open
   the garage door.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.926
I hope he has
dork insurance.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.198
I'm serious, you gotta take
Driver's Ed seriously,

04:58.231 --> 05:00.233
   or you're not gonna
   get your license.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.202
  -Don't sweat it.
  -Hi, Kelly.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.404
  Hey, see the ring?

05:04.437 --> 05:08.842
-Hi, Kelly.
-See the ring?

05:08.875 --> 05:13.146
 Zack, we are not going steady.
 This is just
 a friendship ring.

05:13.947 --> 05:17.317
-Hi, Zackie.
-See the ring?

05:24.057 --> 05:25.392
   Why's everybody so down?

05:25.425 --> 05:27.560
None of us have
enough money for a car.

05:27.594 --> 05:30.864
I'm gonna drive my father's
Porsche when I turn 16.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.633
Slip into your PJ's baby,
'cause you're dreaming.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.904
   Hey guys,
   I've got some great news.

05:37.937 --> 05:40.373
   Your last baby tooth
   fell out!

05:40.407 --> 05:42.909
   No, I just bought a car!

05:44.544 --> 05:48.915
  -Can we see it?
  -Sure,
  come on over to the house.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.518
  You know, Slater, if I hadn't
  gotten that ring for Kelly,

05:51.551 --> 05:53.253
   I could've bought a car.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.655
 Batteries or wind-up?

05:59.459 --> 06:02.128
   I just couldn't believe it
   when I saw it on the lot.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.597
 It's exactly the car I wanted.

06:05.598 --> 06:08.101
   Well, what do you think?

06:08.134 --> 06:10.103
It's...

06:10.136 --> 06:11.638
 nice.

06:11.671 --> 06:14.507
Really nice... really.

06:15.608 --> 06:20.213
  Yeah, it's...
  it's all Lisa said.

06:20.246 --> 06:23.350
 Gosh, it's got
 a license plate holder, too.

06:26.419 --> 06:30.657
  Well, it's everything I hoped
  it would be and more!

06:30.690 --> 06:33.493
  Well, Slater,
  your Malibu Classic,
  my Valiant.

06:33.526 --> 06:36.196
 We know what kind
 of wheels chicks dig.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.099
Excuse me, little man,
but we are not chicks.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.935
  She's right, Screech.
  Listen to the babe.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.070
I'm not a babe.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.240
  And I respect that,
  Sugar Lips.

06:48.541 --> 06:52.212
 You can open up
 a juice stand
 with this old lemon.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.447
 Listen, Preppie,
 this baby's gonna look great

06:54.481 --> 06:56.416
  after I give it
  a little facelift.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.518
   Give me a break,
   the doctors who
   worked on Michael Jackson

06:58.551 --> 07:00.553
couldn't help
this old heap.

07:00.587 --> 07:04.157
   -Give him a break, Zack.
   -We'll help you
   wash it, Slater.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.129
  Well, that's it, finished.

07:09.162 --> 07:12.098
 This is so awesome.
 I wish I had a car like this.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.633
  Don't worry, Kelly.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.603
 I'll be glad to
 take you wherever
 you want to go... all of you!

07:16.636 --> 07:20.440
   -All right!
   -Lost cause, eh, Preppie?

07:21.541 --> 07:23.076
So what's the big deal?

07:23.109 --> 07:25.211
None of us can drive
until we're 16 anyway.

07:25.245 --> 07:28.715
  I've got seven months to find
  an old junker
  and fix it up too.

07:28.748 --> 07:32.352
 -I can't wait
 to go for a ride.
 -You won't have to wait long.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.554
 I turn 16 next week.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.156
All: All right!

07:36.189 --> 07:39.059
   Time out.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.729
   Slater doesn't know it,
   but he's going to
   fail Drive's Ed.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.604
  Mr. Tuttle, can I see you?

07:51.638 --> 07:55.108
 Want to get an early start
 on the wisecracks, eh, Mr.
   Morris?

07:55.141 --> 07:58.578
  No, sir.
  Driver's Ed is
  an important class,

07:58.611 --> 08:00.814
and I'm gonna take it
seriously from now on.

08:00.847 --> 08:04.017
   -Unlike Slater.
   -Slater?

08:04.017 --> 08:06.786
 What about Slater?
 He's my best student.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.923
   I know, sir, but he's become
   too cocky about it.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.493
 And a cocky driver
 is a reckless driver.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.829
   I find it hard to believe

08:15.862 --> 08:18.498
   that a fine young man
   like AC Slater...

08:18.531 --> 08:22.035
Well, sir, he's telling
everyone that he should
   teach the class.

08:22.068 --> 08:26.506
 That muscle-bound punk
 said that?

08:26.539 --> 08:29.642
Well, pish-tosh,
I'll show him!

08:32.078 --> 08:34.647
  Class, the only way
  you can really
  learn how to drive

08:34.681 --> 08:38.051
  is to get behind the wheel.
  Now, who wants to be first?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.520
 I would, Mr. Tuttle!

08:40.553 --> 08:43.056
  Eager to show off
  are we, Mr. Slater?

08:43.056 --> 08:46.693
You can wait your turn.

08:46.726 --> 08:50.096
 Miss Turtle, what's the first
 thing we do when we get
 behind the wheel?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.931
   -Adjust the mirrors.
   -Correct!

08:51.965 --> 08:56.069
 -And for what purpose?
 -To check my make-up.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.238
   Miss Turtle, I suggest
   you either study harder,

08:58.271 --> 09:01.708
 or start practicing
 how to say, ''Taxi!''

09:01.741 --> 09:04.044
   Screech, why don't you
   start up the car?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.079
 Great. I can't wait.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.893
   ( sighs )

09:26.232 --> 09:29.269
 Will you vacate
 the vehicle?

09:29.302 --> 09:32.172
Out!
Out, out, out!

09:32.205 --> 09:34.207
 Next, please.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.543
  Mr. Tuttle, can I try now?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.079
 Pushy, pushy,

09:39.112 --> 09:41.715
   move your tushy.

09:44.184 --> 09:48.722
 I know a hotshot
 like you will want
 more of a challenge.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.095
Okay, speed boy, drive!

10:15.281 --> 10:18.051
  -Wow!
  -How was that, Mr. Tuttle?

10:18.084 --> 10:19.052
 Great, great, great.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.955
I could use
a teaching assistant
next semester.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.157
 I'd love to help you out, sir,

10:24.190 --> 10:28.395
  but I'll be busy
  cruising around
  with a certain young lady.

10:35.101 --> 10:38.171
  -Enjoying the movie, Kel?
  -Oh, Slater.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.007
   I've never realized how much
   fun movies could be

10:41.041 --> 10:44.010
until I watched them
in your beautiful car.

10:48.381 --> 10:52.652
After this, we'll drive
to that big bluff
overlooking the ocean,

10:52.686 --> 10:54.988
 and just... oh, yeah.

10:56.956 --> 11:00.060
 You know, Zack never used
 to drive me anywhere.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.828
 Zack?

11:01.861 --> 11:05.265
  You mean that
  15-year-old without a car?

11:05.298 --> 11:08.168
 Whatever happened to the boy?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.070
  Who cares?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.239
   Oh yeah.

11:21.781 --> 11:25.085
   Gee,
   Zack, I never realized how
   much fun a movie could be

11:25.085 --> 11:28.755
until I watched them
on your beautiful bike.

11:28.788 --> 11:32.092
   Will you shut up?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.160
( bell rings )

11:35.862 --> 11:38.098
   That was
   awesome driving, Slater.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.700
Nothing to it!

11:40.734 --> 11:43.303
 All right, I'm down,
 but not out.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.739
  Watch this.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.807
  Slater, I think I'm gonna
  flunk Driver's Ed.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.843
 Can you give me
 a private lesson after school?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.444
  -No way.
  -20 bucks?

11:51.478 --> 11:54.280
-4:00 okay?
-See you then.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.985
Zack, why'd you want
to see me here?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.887
  Well, Screech,
  I told Mr. Belding

12:00.920 --> 12:02.789
  you do a great impression
  of Mr. Tuttle,

12:02.822 --> 12:03.857
   and he wants to hear it.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.059
  Sure, which stall is he in?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.227
   He's not in here.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.195
He's in his office
waiting for us to call.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.264
  Now, pretend
  you're Mr. Tuttle,

12:11.297 --> 12:14.234
  and tell Belding
  to get the keys
  out of the Driver's Ed car.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.902
Got it.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.239
Belding: <i>Hello?</i>

12:19.272 --> 12:20.640
  Mr. Belding,
  this is Mr. Tuttle.

12:20.674 --> 12:24.144
Could you do me a favor
and get the keys out of
 the Driver's Ed car?

12:24.177 --> 12:26.146
 I left them
 by mistake, mistake, mistake.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.382
  -Why can't you do it?
  -Why can't I do it?

12:29.416 --> 12:33.720
 I'm shaving my body hair
 so I'll swim faster.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.089
  Sorry I asked.
  All right, Tuttle,

12:36.089 --> 12:38.124
I'll get the keys
out of the car for you.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.394
 Now is there anything else
 I could do for you?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.897
   Good. Now stall him
   for five minutes. Got it?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.335
Yeah. Could you tell me
that really long story

12:48.368 --> 12:50.937
 about how you became
 a principal?

12:50.970 --> 12:54.341
   All right, if you insist.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.377
It all began with a boy
and a dream.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.181
   The year was 1956,
   Eisenhower was President,

13:01.214 --> 13:03.116
Elvis was King,

13:03.149 --> 13:06.152
 I was in kindergarten on
 a finger-painting scholarship.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.388
   Boy, I love those paints.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.260
Hey, hey, hey!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.296
  We could get in trouble
  bringing the car out here.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.431
 Would you relax?
 There's no one else to see us.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.768
  Besides,
  for 20 bucks, I should get
  some more room to maneuver.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.437
  Okay, let's just
  get this over with.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.073
  Why don't you get in the car,
  and show me how it's done?

13:27.073 --> 13:29.109
  I'll just study your
  every move from over here.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.411
 Okay.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.914
   -Hi, Slater! Out for a spin?
   -What are you doing here?

13:34.948 --> 13:37.550
 -I'm going to
 volleyball practice.
 -Hop in. I'll drive you there.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.319
 -Thanks!
 -No, Kelly get out of the car!

13:39.352 --> 13:41.087
 Kelly, get out of the car!
 No, Kelly!

13:41.087 --> 13:45.425
 -( loud crash, Kelly screams )
 -Great going, Slater!

13:45.458 --> 13:48.428
 It wouldn't have happened
 if it wasn't for you, Preppie.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.431
-Are you okay, Kelly?
-Yeah, I guess so.
I hit my head.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.933
-What's going on out there?
-Hey, it's Belding!

13:53.967 --> 13:56.436
   Let's get out of here!
   Come on, come on.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.574
  What the...

14:01.608 --> 14:04.411
 I don't believe this.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.915
   Whoever did this
   is in plenty of trouble!

14:08.948 --> 14:10.483
Do you hear me?

14:11.818 --> 14:13.820
   ( horn blaring )

14:25.331 --> 14:27.701
but you're always
the rebel, aren't you?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.736
   Oh, sure,

14:29.769 --> 14:31.671
 blame Tuttle.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.341
 Forget that he has feelings.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.778
   Forget that he
   was next in line
   to be principal,

14:38.812 --> 14:42.282
had the color scheme
for this office
all picked out.

14:43.817 --> 14:47.654
Your taste is so tacky.

14:49.322 --> 14:53.093
So is your personality.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.895
   If you'll excuse me,
   the school has a problem,

14:55.929 --> 14:59.265
 and the principal
 who was hired will take over.

14:59.299 --> 15:03.269
   Whatever you say,
   ''Mr. Balding.''

15:10.176 --> 15:12.078
Attention, students...

15:12.112 --> 15:15.348
<i>I would like the person</i>
<i>or persons responsible</i>

15:15.382 --> 15:17.283
  <i>for damaging</i>
  <i>the Driver's Ed car</i>

15:17.317 --> 15:20.053
 <i>to come to my office</i>
 <i>immediately.</i>

15:26.493 --> 15:31.064
 You have until noon
 tomorrow to confess, or else!

15:33.767 --> 15:35.702
   Or else?

15:35.735 --> 15:37.837
  Somebody's in big trouble.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.706
  It was me.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.174
  Kelly, you wrecked the car?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.243
 Not exactly.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.311
 Slater was driving
 and then I hopped in.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.347
 Then Zack got jealous,
 tried to get me out,

15:47.380 --> 15:48.948
  and Slater crashed.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.117
   Hey, Kelly,
   how's your head?

15:51.151 --> 15:53.420
 I have a bump,
 but it doesn't hurt that much.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.324
 -I'm sorry you got hurt.
 -It wasn't your fault, Zack.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.193
 It wasn't?
 Yeah, right!

16:00.226 --> 16:02.262
  Slater was the one driving.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.464
Like you had
nothing to do with it.

16:04.497 --> 16:08.802
 All I know is,
 if I had wrecked
 the car, I'd turn myself in.

16:09.936 --> 16:13.039
 Slater, why don't you
 be a man and confess?

16:13.039 --> 16:15.942
 Jessie, why don't you
 be a woman and cook?

16:16.843 --> 16:19.746
   Hey, cut it out.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.382
  Slater, we shouldn't have
  been in the car
  in the first place.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.417
Let's go tell
Mr. Belding the truth.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.119
  Okay, you're right.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.154
  It's just that if Belding
  hadn't shown up,

16:28.188 --> 16:30.824
  we could've put the car back
  and nobody would've known.

16:30.857 --> 16:33.326
   -What was he doing there?
   -Getting
   the keys out of the car.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.528
 Oops.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.865
 Screech, what do you know?
 And tell the truth.

16:38.898 --> 16:42.469
   No, no matter what you do
   to me, you won't break me.
   I won't talk.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.938
  It was Zack!
  He made sure Belding
  would catch you in the car.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.973
Tell him
you tortured me, okay?

16:48.942 --> 16:50.110
We were gonna confess,

16:50.143 --> 16:51.411
and Zack was behind it
the whole time.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.114
 -He should be
 the one to confess.
 -Fat chance.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.915
   You'd have
   an easier time trying
   to get that thing

16:55.949 --> 16:58.418
 off Gorbachev's head.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.854
  Unless Zack feels guilty...

17:00.887 --> 17:04.023
 so guilty that he has
 to get it off his conscience.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.827
   -Kelly,
   how does your head feel?
   -It feels fine.

17:07.861 --> 17:11.196
 I think you're about
 to take a turn for the worse.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.936
 -Hi, guys.
 -Hi.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.305
   Screech.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.041
-Where's Kelly?
-I don't know.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.511
 Maybe she went home.
 She said she had a headache.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.547
   Like the kind you
   get when you hit
   your head in an accident.

17:27.579 --> 17:31.051
 Come on, she's fine.
 No big deal.

17:37.323 --> 17:41.061
Hi, everyone.
Hi, I'm Kelly Kapowski.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.264
   -Very funny.
   -Who is this guy?

17:44.297 --> 17:46.299
   What do you mean,
   who am I?

17:46.332 --> 17:49.369
   Maybe that bump on your head
   affected your memory.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.404
This is Zack Morris,
your boyfriend.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.407
   He gave you
   the ring you're wearing.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.310
  Wait a minute.
  There must be some mistake.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.212
   I don't have a boyfriend.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.413
  Do you remember me?

18:00.447 --> 18:04.250
 Well, yeah, you're Tom Cruise,
 the coolest guy at school.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.020
 She seems fine to me.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.290
   I don't believe this!
   Kelly, it's Zack.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.926
   This guy is major weird!

18:14.561 --> 18:16.429
 She really doesn't
 remember me?

18:16.463 --> 18:18.331
 I think it's only temporary.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.367
  She probably has
  selective amnesia,

18:20.400 --> 18:23.203
 it's where a person
 blocks out a painful memory.

18:23.236 --> 18:27.173
 I wonder if
 that's why my family
 always calls me ''Hey, you.''

18:28.408 --> 18:32.045
Wait a minute.
I do have a boyfriend!

18:32.045 --> 18:35.048
 How could I forget someone
 that special to me?

18:35.048 --> 18:38.184
  Meet me after school?
  We have lots of
  catching up to do.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.487
   I think I better play along,
   Preppie...

18:40.520 --> 18:42.922
  for Kelly's own good,
  of course.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.091
 -I think you're right.
 -Absolutely.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.061
 No, wait! Kelly,
 this whole thing was my fault.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.296
 I tricked Slater
 into driving the car.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.198
  I'm gonna tell
  Belding everything,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.434
 then we're going to get you
 the best doctor money can buy.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.603
  I knew you'd
  come through, Zack.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.105
-Zack?
-Uh-oh.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.175
 Hey, who told you what I did?

19:02.208 --> 19:04.177
 ( whistling )

19:08.114 --> 19:11.117
Zack,
Tuttle went to get Belding.
You've got to confess.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.519
   Would you relax?

19:12.552 --> 19:15.422
  Hey, I know Belding better
  than Belding knows Belding.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.158
  So what's your point,
  big shot?

19:18.191 --> 19:21.895
  First Belding
  will give everyone
  one last chance to confess.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.931
 No one will. Then he'll say
 he's very disappointed in us,

19:25.031 --> 19:27.434
 and since he doesn't know
 who's guilty,
 he can't punish them.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.070
   Then he'll leave.

19:31.404 --> 19:34.040
I'm so nervous
my make-up is cracking.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.210
Why are you nervous?
You didn't do anything.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.680
   Oh, yeah, right.

19:44.484 --> 19:49.055
  -Let me through.
  -It's my classroom.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.694
  All right,

19:54.728 --> 19:58.498
  I am giving everyone
  one last chance to confess.

20:01.668 --> 20:05.472
 I want you to know
 that I am very
 disappointed in you.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.142
 Since I don't
 know who's guilty,
 I can't punish them.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.513
Class, isn't that fair
of Mr. Belding?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.382
 All: Yes, very fair.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.650
   I'm not finished.

20:20.353 --> 20:24.491
  Since I can't punish
  the guilty, I'm gonna punish
  everyone instead.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.259
   -All: What?
   -( all shouting )

20:27.660 --> 20:30.430
 Driver's Ed is being canceled,

20:30.463 --> 20:32.465
 and you'll all repeat
 the course next year.

20:32.499 --> 20:35.135
You can use those 12 months
to think about this.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.170
 ( shouting )

20:39.139 --> 20:41.274
 Do I still get paid?

20:43.209 --> 20:45.712
   Confess!
   Somebody confess!

20:46.379 --> 20:47.714
 Wait.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.083
  It isn't fair for
  the whole class to suffer.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.085
 I'll take the blame.

20:52.118 --> 20:55.355
  -You did this, Kelly?
  -Well, actually...

20:55.388 --> 20:59.092
Uh-huh, I didn't think so.
Who are you protecting?

20:59.125 --> 21:01.261
   -Me.
   -Slater?

21:01.294 --> 21:04.464
   -Not...
   -I drove the car.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.233
  Was anyone else involved,
  I hope?

21:07.267 --> 21:10.070
 The punishment will be smaller
 if there are two
 people to share it.

21:10.070 --> 21:12.372
 It was just me, sir.
 No one else.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.774
  I was in the seat,
  I'll take the heat.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.079
   All right then.
   AC, come with me.

21:19.079 --> 21:22.415
 -Class may continue.
 -Zack: Stop.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.452
 It wasn't his fault.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.088
 This whole thing was my idea.

21:28.088 --> 21:30.223
  I was jealous
  that Slater was gonna
  get his license before me,

21:30.256 --> 21:33.193
  so I set him up
  to get kicked
  out of Driver's Ed.

21:33.226 --> 21:35.662
Wow, good plan!

21:38.264 --> 21:40.266
Kelly had nothing to do
with this.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.103
  She just showed up
  at the wrong time.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.572
  I'm sorry, Kelly,
  I thought I'd
  lose you to Slater.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.208
   Slater...

21:48.241 --> 21:50.377
  you have two weeks detention.
  Take your seat.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.479
   Yes, sir.

21:52.512 --> 21:56.116
   That was very
   fair of you, sir.
   I expected worse.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.184
 You're getting worse.

21:58.218 --> 22:00.820
 Zack, you flunk Driver's Ed.
 You'll make it up next year.

22:00.854 --> 22:03.723
 Now pack up your stuff
 and let's go.

22:06.726 --> 22:10.130
 And that, Mr. Tuttle,
 is how you principal.

22:12.332 --> 22:16.736
''And that, Mr. Tuttle,
is how you principal.''

22:16.770 --> 22:19.806
   -Zack?
   -You don't have
   to say it, Kelly.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.474
 I acted like a jerk.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.476
You did, but...

22:23.510 --> 22:25.245
 can I have
 the jerk's ring back?

22:26.246 --> 22:27.814
Do you mean it?

22:34.888 --> 22:37.891
  Morris. Time's up.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.563
  Wait for me, Kelly.

22:43.596 --> 22:46.433
 Oh. But not in Slater's car!

22:53.807 --> 22:56.643
 ( instrumental music plays )
