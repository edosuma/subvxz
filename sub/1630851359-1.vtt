00:54.722 --> 00:56.974
I must be mad.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.560
<i>I should've known all along.</i>

00:59.727 --> 01:03.314
<i>If your hobby is death,
you must be mad.</i>

01:03.481 --> 01:06.358
<i>Mad I may be.
Crazy I am not.</i>

01:06.525 --> 01:08.444
<i>Don't take me for a psycho.</i>

01:10.321 --> 01:12.531
<i>Corpses are not my thing.</i>

01:12.698 --> 01:14.825
<i>What interests me is Death.</i>

01:14.992 --> 01:16.327
<i>With a capital D.</i>

01:18.621 --> 01:20.539
<i>Corpses scare me.</i>

01:20.706 --> 01:22.458
<i>They have a terrible effect on me.</i>

01:23.501 --> 01:24.543
<i>Actually,</i>

01:24.710 --> 01:27.755
<i>one corpse had a terrible effect on me.</i>

01:27.922 --> 01:30.216
<i>That's what I'm telling you about.</i>

01:32.718 --> 01:34.595
<i>If Death doesn't interest you...</i>

01:35.513 --> 01:40.059
<i>if you don't want to hear
about a corpse I knew when it was alive,</i>

01:40.226 --> 01:43.729
<i>if you don't want to know
what happened to him and me,</i>

01:43.896 --> 01:46.148
<i>and how he became a corpse,</i>

01:46.315 --> 01:48.984
<i>you'd better stop right here.</i>

01:49.151 --> 01:50.736
This is no story for you.

01:52.238 --> 01:55.616
SUMMER OF 85

02:36.365 --> 02:39.034
Hey, Chris!
Are you going into junior year?

02:39.201 --> 02:40.744
Yeah, tech studies. You?

02:40.911 --> 02:44.039
Literature, I think.
Wanna celebrate on your boat?

02:44.206 --> 02:47.251
I'd love to, but...
I'm meeting someone.

02:47.418 --> 02:48.460
Who?

02:48.627 --> 02:49.670
Surprise.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.172
Skip your meeting.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.506
You can take the boat.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.633
It's boring to go alone.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.722
Sorry.

02:59.889 --> 03:01.348
- See you around.
- Bye.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.562
Help!

05:10.936 --> 05:11.895
Need help?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.439
Yeah.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.776
It's simple.
Get it upright and I'll tow you in.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.321
Try.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.280
Climb up.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.618
- These yours?
- Yeah.

05:29.872 --> 05:30.789
Ever done it?

05:32.207 --> 05:35.502
Grab the centerboard
and the boat'll turn over.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.962
Okay?

05:37.129 --> 05:39.882
Stand up. Good.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.175
Go on.

05:41.342 --> 05:45.346
<i>Enter David Gorman,
aged 18 years and 1 month.</i>

05:45.512 --> 05:48.557
<i>He's the future corpse.
David.</i>

06:09.203 --> 06:10.746
Here.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.539
Thanks.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.793
- You live out in Les Côteaux?
- Yeah.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.920
We'll go to my house, it's closer.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.797
Thanks, I'll be fine.

06:19.963 --> 06:23.217
Don't argue.
I know about capsizes.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.552
The boat belongs to a friend...

06:25.719 --> 06:27.888
I'll handle the boats after.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.390
Put on your jeans.

06:45.531 --> 06:48.700
- How are you, Alexis?
- It's Alex.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.536
Alex?

06:50.702 --> 06:52.371
Since this summer.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.248
Okay, Alex.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.874
Know why you're here?

06:57.668 --> 06:59.670
To discuss what you did.

06:59.837 --> 07:00.838
I don't want to.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.715
I'm not here to judge you,
but to understand.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.261
The judge needs to know
why you did it.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.972
- I'll give him my opinion.
- No.

07:10.139 --> 07:13.016
It's none of your business.
Or anyone's.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.603
Are Mrs. Gorman's accusations justified?

07:19.314 --> 07:22.484
Okay.
The police officer's report says,

07:22.651 --> 07:25.487
"The individual arrived at 11 p.m..."

07:25.654 --> 07:26.488
Alexis!

07:29.199 --> 07:31.368
You could go to jail.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.787
Get a heavy sentence.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.746
Come.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.258
See? I live close.

08:03.108 --> 08:03.901
Come in.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.863
- Hi, honey.
- Mom, meet Alex.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.115
No, it's Alexis.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.950
What'd you do to him?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.036
He capsized, that's all.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.456
I keep telling you
those boats are dangerous!

08:17.623 --> 08:18.540
It's okay.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.502
The poor darling
is freezing to death.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.421
A hot bath is all you need.

08:24.588 --> 08:25.422
In the tub!

08:25.589 --> 08:28.091
All David's capsized friends
go in the tub.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.011
Some do it on purpose I think.
Move!

08:31.178 --> 08:33.055
They must like my bathroom!

08:38.310 --> 08:40.521
Off with your clothes.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.105
What are you waiting for?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.901
Think I don't know about boys?

08:46.068 --> 08:46.902
Ma'am...

08:47.069 --> 08:51.031
Don't be like David.
Locks his mom out of the bathroom!

08:51.198 --> 08:54.493
I gave birth to him.
He's just bigger now.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.996
- I'm not used to...
- Your mom neglects you?

09:01.959 --> 09:03.710
In any case,

09:03.877 --> 09:05.420
she can be proud of you.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.798
Handsome boy.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.551
Hop in, you'll catch your death.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.803
I'll make you a sweet cup of tea.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.805
Nothing better after such a shock.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.819
<i>Bathtubs always remind me of coffins.</i>

09:28.986 --> 09:31.989
<i>The Gormans' reminded me
of a sarcophagus.</i>

09:32.155 --> 09:37.035
<i>The whole room reminded me
of the grave chamber in a pyramid.</i>

09:39.580 --> 09:40.664
Nice swim?

09:40.831 --> 09:41.915
Yeah.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.959
I thought it was your mom.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.044
I tricked her and snuck in.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.590
What's worse, capsizing
or being undressed by your mom?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.008
I'd rather capsize.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.636
Can you hand me the towel?

09:54.803 --> 09:56.388
- Sure.
- Thanks.

10:01.143 --> 10:04.688
Mom's going to the shop,
if you want to stay.

10:04.855 --> 10:08.775
I have to dock my friend's boat,
then go to school.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.776
Okay.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.864
I've got clean clothes for you.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.949
I'll deal with the boat.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.743
- Thanks.
- Sure.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.748
When you're done,
it's the last door.

10:22.914 --> 10:23.915
Okay.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.887
- Here.
- Thanks.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.889
We're about the same size.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.893
- Shoe size?
- 8.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.062
I'm 9. Want some shoes?

10:45.228 --> 10:47.648
No thanks, mine'll dry out.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.819
- There.
- Thanks.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.284
- What's that?
- This...

11:00.494 --> 11:01.662
is for hair.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.373
There's a mirror.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.332
Cool.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.003
- Hungry?
- Yeah, but I'm late.

11:10.170 --> 11:14.299
Mom made us a snack.
She'll be upset if you don't eat.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.552
You two do this
for every boy who capsizes?

11:17.719 --> 11:18.762
Of course not.

11:18.929 --> 11:22.182
I'm off today,
so I can look after you. Come on.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.020
My father died suddenly last year.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.772
I'm sorry.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.607
Don't worry, it's over.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.818
He and Mom ran the shop.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.988
Mom did the accounts.
Dad knew a bit about sailing.

11:37.155 --> 11:41.159
He was a sailor when he was young.
Customers liked him.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.745
He could sell them anything.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.457
When he died,
I had no choice.

11:47.624 --> 11:51.169
I quit school and started working
full time at the shop.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.841
Tough, leaving school
to be a salesman.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.968
I'm no salesman.

11:58.135 --> 11:58.969
I run the shop.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.638
Right.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.682
The shop pays the bills...

12:04.766 --> 12:06.143
but it was Dad's whole life.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.061
But not necessarily yours.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.065
Would you follow
your dad's footsteps?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.736
My dad's a docker at the shipyard.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.946
You don't wanna be a docker?

12:19.364 --> 12:22.075
- What do you wanna do?
- No idea.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.785
That's the big question.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.706
Get a job, or stay in school?

12:27.873 --> 12:30.417
That's why Lefèvre wants to see me.

12:30.584 --> 12:34.337
You can count on him
to give you his opinion.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.798
Did he counsel you too?

12:36.965 --> 12:37.883
A few times.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.183
You'll tell me about it tonight.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.021
What?
You gotta come get your clothes.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.189
Mom'll wash them.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.441
I'd like to get mine back too.

12:58.528 --> 13:02.949
I dock the boat, you see Lefèvre,
then we go to the cinema.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.493
Sound good?

13:04.659 --> 13:05.494
Yeah.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.496
- Meet me here at eight?
- Okay.

13:07.662 --> 13:08.455
Perfect.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.046
Mr. Robin, come in.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.507
So...

13:18.673 --> 13:20.759
Since when, the interest in death?

13:21.968 --> 13:23.637
As I wrote, it's been a while.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.139
As a kid, I loved the Egyptians,

13:26.306 --> 13:30.685
their relationship with death,
the funeral rites, the mummies.

13:30.852 --> 13:31.895
I see.

13:33.104 --> 13:36.191
Would you call
this modest piece of prose

13:36.358 --> 13:39.277
a documentary essay
or a work of fiction?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.199
I don't really know.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.701
It's about things I've felt.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.705
But I invented the details.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.958
I'll be frank with you, Mr. Robin.

13:53.124 --> 13:53.959
Yes?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.128
Your work is very promising.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.589
Thank you, sir.

13:59.756 --> 14:03.343
I'm not saying you're a literary genius,
far from it.

14:03.510 --> 14:07.681
Some of your classmates produce
more impressive work.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.558
But you're progressing.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.142
Thank you.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.645
Have you decided
what to do next year?

14:14.938 --> 14:16.898
Dad wants me to work...

14:17.065 --> 14:20.360
- And Mom wants you to be happy?
- Exactly.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.530
I pushed to have you
in my literature class.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.199
You're gifted.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.994
You're a credit to the school.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.496
I'll help if you decide to stay.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.081
Thank you, sir.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.000
Think it over.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.752
I'm here if you want to talk.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.475
Seeing the judge didn't change him.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.270
He wanders like a zombie,
shuts himself away.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.063
Won't even go to the beach.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.608
Alexis is a sweet boy.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.360
He's not like other boys his age.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.737
He's intelligent.

15:03.904 --> 15:07.908
But sometimes
we don't understand what he's saying.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.243
Maybe he needs a kick in the ass!

15:10.410 --> 15:13.121
I disagree.
He's had enough trauma.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.373
What we want,

15:15.540 --> 15:17.292
is for him to be okay.

15:17.459 --> 15:21.338
We want to help him.
He's our son and we love him.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.427
Your caseworker is here.

15:33.558 --> 15:34.392
Thank you.

15:38.355 --> 15:42.108
Your mother thinks I should meet
your teacher, Mr. Lefèvre.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.905
What do you think?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.158
I don't care.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.701
Do what you want.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.122
Ah, hello!

15:56.289 --> 15:58.458
David, it's your new friend.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.543
- The one who capsized.
- Let him in.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.295
Go on!

16:02.462 --> 16:07.133
David's a bad boy.
He came to work on his day off.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.010
He does that every week.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.346
- I brought your clothes.
- Thanks.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.850
- Hungry?
- No thanks, I ate at home.

16:16.017 --> 16:19.396
What good is a day off
if you go to work?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.357
He's worse than his father.

16:22.524 --> 16:26.069
A slave to that shop for 20 years.
And the result? He's dead.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.407
I thought you were his friend.
Some friend!

16:32.117 --> 16:34.369
- Answer the lady.
- What?

16:34.536 --> 16:36.079
Are you my friend?

16:36.246 --> 16:38.373
Am I your friend?

16:38.540 --> 16:40.333
I think you are, but are you?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.961
- If you think so...
- You are?

16:43.378 --> 16:46.589
In which case we can safely say...

16:46.756 --> 16:48.341
That I'm indeed your friend.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.135
Some friend,

16:50.301 --> 16:53.638
letting you work
when you two should be out having fun,

16:53.805 --> 16:55.724
and you should be resting.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.559
Alex didn't know I went to work.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.395
He had an important meeting.
He's innocent.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.646
Is that true?

17:01.813 --> 17:02.897
Yeah.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.482
You're so cute.

17:05.734 --> 17:06.860
I could eat you up!

17:08.361 --> 17:10.155
My adorable little bunny!

17:10.321 --> 17:12.198
Mom...

17:12.365 --> 17:13.950
Your game show's on.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.535
Already?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.579
But my dishes!

17:17.746 --> 17:19.456
- We'll do them.
- Really?

17:19.622 --> 17:22.042
Then we'll go to the cinema.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.002
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.049
David, don't stay out all night.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.050
I promise.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.343
- Alex, can I trust you?
- Yes.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.138
My David needs a real friend.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.394
It's lovely to see you together.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.480
- Goodnight, Mom.
- Goodnight.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.401
Shall we take my Suzuki?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.403
If you like.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.990
Wait, no spare helmet.
Too many cops in town.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.327
- I'll buy you one.
- Will we be taking a trip?

17:57.494 --> 17:59.120
Why not?

17:59.287 --> 18:01.414
Tuesday, Wednesday afternoon,

18:01.581 --> 18:03.958
Thursday, and Saturday all day.

18:04.125 --> 18:08.546
Mom's a genius with numbers
but hopeless with customers.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.507
It's too much for me alone.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.175
What's your mom say?

18:12.342 --> 18:15.261
She's counting on you.
She'd be so happy.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.473
I'll think about it.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.016
Scared of me?

18:20.183 --> 18:21.976
I just need to think.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.062
Okay, no need to shit bricks.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.527
- It's a bit more than a job offer though.
- No.

18:30.693 --> 18:34.447
Just be polite, relaxed, cheerful...

18:34.614 --> 18:36.616
It's not rocket science.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.993
Customers will love your angel face.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.412
I'm not thinking of them.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.789
Who, then?

18:43.998 --> 18:45.583
Want the truth?

18:46.835 --> 18:47.710
I dare you.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.091
- I'm thinking of you.
- Me? What'd I do now?

18:53.258 --> 18:55.552
We only met this morning.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.595
Why waste time?

18:57.762 --> 18:59.764
We're all mortals.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.641
Yeah.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.726
I need time to get used to it.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.436
Okay, I'll shut up.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.374
Here's an idea.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.751
We get a drink...

20:10.793 --> 20:12.545
my treat,
then I take you home.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.255
Wait, look at that guy.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.219
Move, asshole!

20:25.225 --> 20:26.017
Look out!

20:27.727 --> 20:28.937
What are you doing?

20:30.271 --> 20:32.732
- Move!
- Shut up!

20:38.571 --> 20:39.906
Let me swim!

20:40.073 --> 20:41.616
No swimming for you.

20:42.659 --> 20:43.701
What do we do?

20:43.868 --> 20:46.621
Get him somewhere safe
so he can ferment.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.581
How about the morgue?

20:48.748 --> 20:49.874
The morgue?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.293
- Is it low tide?
- Yeah.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.046
- It's low tide.
- I'm gonna take a dip!

20:56.297 --> 20:57.799
Let him sleep it off.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.592
We can't leave him here.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.178
No one else cares.
He'll get hurt.

21:02.345 --> 21:05.515
Fuck him.
It's his own fault he's drunk.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.351
You didn't say that
this morning on the boat.

21:09.394 --> 21:12.689
Right. Thanks for saving me,
Mr. Good Shepherd!

21:12.855 --> 21:14.941
Anytime.
I don't see much difference

21:15.108 --> 21:18.653
between his drunken stupidity
and yours on that boat.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.281
- Guys...
- Yeah?

21:21.447 --> 21:23.283
I got a surprise for you.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.784
Now what?

21:24.951 --> 21:26.452
I pissed myself.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.537
Really?

21:30.039 --> 21:33.459
Alex, it's funny!
He wanted a swim and wet himself!

21:35.211 --> 21:36.838
You okay?

21:37.005 --> 21:38.381
Look, the beach.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.550
Slower, slower...

21:41.592 --> 21:45.013
Alex, stop sulking!
The night is still young.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.348
I don't see why you're helping him.

21:47.515 --> 21:50.018
- You always need a reason?
- Yes.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.895
He's a nice guy, okay?

21:53.062 --> 21:55.565
Don't leave me, guys!

21:55.732 --> 21:57.066
Come help me.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.443
Get up.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.154
Come on.

22:03.906 --> 22:04.907
We'll put him here.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.659
- Am I dead?
- Not yet.

22:06.826 --> 22:07.910
I feel dead...

22:08.077 --> 22:08.953
Fuck!

22:28.556 --> 22:31.768
<i>Discovering the sleeping boy's face,</i>

22:31.934 --> 22:35.605
<i>I realized why David
had insisted on rescuing him.</i>

22:37.732 --> 22:41.110
<i>And why, that very morning,
he had rescued me.</i>

22:56.834 --> 22:58.252
Still not up?

22:58.419 --> 23:01.547
- I went to bed late, Dad.
- No excuses.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.717
Stop being lazy.
Let's go, your mother has work.

23:40.837 --> 23:42.713
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.679
Mom, come have a coffee.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.764
It's not my coffee time yet.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.975
Treat yourself for once.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.315
You're right, dear.

24:09.031 --> 24:12.285
Stop sleeping so late.
Your father's worried.

24:12.452 --> 24:15.413
What's he care?
I'm on vacation and he's at work.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.958
- He asks me what you do.
- Don't tell him.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.252
I can't lie to your father, dear.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.591
It was past one when you came in.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.554
He says you need to find a job

24:31.721 --> 24:34.307
to keep you busy
and butter our bread.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.559
You want me to stay in school.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.811
He thinks if you worked...

24:38.978 --> 24:40.730
But what do you think?

24:40.897 --> 24:43.900
I want you to do
what makes you happy.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.944
- That's what counts.
- I don't know what would.

24:48.029 --> 24:51.449
Many people don't know,
and never find out.

24:53.993 --> 24:58.873
Lefèvre says I should stay in school,
graduate and study literature.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.542
- What use will that be?
- Not much.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.711
Even he says so.

25:03.878 --> 25:06.631
Strange teacher,
advising something of no use.

25:06.797 --> 25:09.634
- He meant for work.
- Work is what counts.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.053
Right, Mom.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.768
Fantastic. I'm thrilled.

25:18.935 --> 25:22.522
Come to the shop.
We'll discuss pay and celebrate.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.983
Mom wants to talk to you.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.443
Alex?

25:27.610 --> 25:28.903
Yes, Mrs. Gorman.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.697
<i>- You're coming to work with us?</i>
- Yes.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.909
Great!
I'll finally have time for myself.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.577
But listen,

25:36.744 --> 25:38.746
<i>I'm a little upset with you.</i>

25:38.913 --> 25:39.956
Why?

25:40.122 --> 25:43.501
You promised
you wouldn't keep David out late.

25:43.668 --> 25:46.921
He came in at four.
You call that early?

25:47.088 --> 25:47.964
Four in the morning?

25:48.130 --> 25:49.465
<i>You promised me.</i>

25:49.632 --> 25:51.384
<i>Four is too late.</i>

25:51.551 --> 25:54.845
Especially when David works mornings.
Weekends are okay.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.681
- I'm sorry, but...
<i>- Never mind.</i>

25:56.847 --> 25:59.809
<i>I'll let it go this time.
Kisses, my little bunny.</i>

25:59.976 --> 26:02.478
<i>David says I talk too much.</i>

26:02.645 --> 26:03.521
Here he is.

26:05.982 --> 26:06.983
Alex?

26:07.149 --> 26:08.401
Yeah.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.486
<i>I'll explain tonight.</i>

26:10.653 --> 26:12.655
<i>We'll be a great team.</i>

26:12.822 --> 26:13.823
Sure.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.033
See you later, Alex.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.880
<i>David had asked me if I was his friend.</i>

26:30.047 --> 26:32.717
<i>But was he really mine?</i>

26:32.883 --> 26:36.178
<i>Someone you can count on
in any circumstance?</i>

26:36.345 --> 26:37.972
<i>Someone you can trust?</i>

26:39.765 --> 26:41.601
<i>Could I trust David?</i>

26:44.061 --> 26:46.147
The water's beautiful,
don't you think?

26:46.314 --> 26:48.649
<i>Enter Kate, 21 years old.</i>

26:48.816 --> 26:51.277
Hope you don't mind me talking to you.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.029
Go right ahead.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.824
I need to work on my French.
I'm rather rusty.

26:56.991 --> 26:58.367
- You speak well.
- Thanks!

26:59.118 --> 27:01.120
I only arrived three days ago.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.247
- Where from?
- England.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.042
My name is Kate.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.960
I'm Alex.
Nice to meet you.

27:08.127 --> 27:08.961
Alex?

27:09.128 --> 27:12.923
Yeah. Short for Alexis.
I don't like Alexis.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.301
Alex is good. I like it.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.181
Right.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.058
I'm going to sunswim now.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.688
It's sunbathe, not sunswim.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.357
Sunbathe.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.859
Will you sunbathe with me?

27:32.026 --> 27:33.694
I'm meeting someone.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.280
A pretty girl, I suppose?

27:36.447 --> 27:39.241
No, a friend.
He's got a summer gig for me.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.618
Gig?

27:40.785 --> 27:42.578
A position...

27:42.745 --> 27:44.163
<i>A job!</i>

27:44.330 --> 27:46.499
Must be a good friend.

27:46.666 --> 27:47.958
I don't know yet.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.338
Maybe we'll meet again?
Hope so.

27:53.798 --> 27:56.759
I work as an au pair.

27:56.926 --> 27:58.552
Are you on holiday?

27:58.719 --> 28:01.055
No, we moved here two years ago.

28:01.222 --> 28:02.848
See you around.
I'm here often.

28:04.684 --> 28:05.893
Sounds good.

28:07.978 --> 28:08.771
Bye.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.282
Hi, Alex.
How are you?

28:20.449 --> 28:21.867
I'm okay.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.994
- Shall I show you the shop?
- Yeah.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.918
CLOSED

28:32.294 --> 28:34.338
Are you mad about last night?

28:34.505 --> 28:36.298
You went back to the drunk?

28:37.717 --> 28:39.969
Yeah, I felt guilty.

28:40.136 --> 28:42.638
Leaving him alone on the beach...

28:42.805 --> 28:44.682
I got scared.

28:44.849 --> 28:47.059
So I went back.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.354
Good thing too.
There were weirdos around.

28:50.521 --> 28:51.772
Then what?

28:51.939 --> 28:54.942
I woke him up and we talked until...

28:55.109 --> 28:56.861
Until four in the morning?

28:57.027 --> 28:59.071
Yeah. He was wasted.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.781
Stop, David.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.491
It's none of my business.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.661
Okay. Forget it, then.

29:05.828 --> 29:07.246
Close your eyes.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.081
- Why?
- Close your eyes.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.250
- Why?
- Got a surprise for you.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.543
A surprise?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.421
Close your eyes.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.009
So, where is it?

29:20.176 --> 29:21.844
Hang on, it's coming.

29:25.556 --> 29:26.766
Open them.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.269
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.354
To hug roads, not boats.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.402
- It's--
- Beautiful.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.237
And it hides your ugly face.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.408
- But I don't have a bike.
- I do.

29:45.993 --> 29:49.079
You and I will take
a thousand trips.

29:49.246 --> 29:50.122
Come on.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.459
It's your last night of freedom.

29:53.626 --> 29:56.921
Tomorrow, I'm your boss
and you're my slave.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.093
It's my first time.

30:03.260 --> 30:08.015
Never put your feet down.
Always keep them on the footrests.

30:08.182 --> 30:10.184
Here and here.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.853
Then relax.
Lean into the movement.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.271
Let yourself go.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.440
Hang on to me tight.

30:20.653 --> 30:21.779
Ready.

30:53.644 --> 30:56.021
<i>It wasn't anti-Semitic.</i>

30:56.188 --> 30:58.357
He and Gorman were close.

30:58.524 --> 31:01.694
Alexis was devastated.
He's still in shock.

31:01.861 --> 31:04.572
The judge needs a reason
for his behavior.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.740
You're the only person he trusts.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.994
I need your help.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.288
If we don't know by next week,

31:12.454 --> 31:15.416
the judge will place him in detention.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.546
I can't betray my pupil's trust in me.

31:21.589 --> 31:24.341
- He has to talk to you himself.
- He refuses.

31:25.175 --> 31:28.012
- I may have an idea.
- What?

31:29.138 --> 31:31.473
If you recommend he stays in school.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.603
I can't do anything
until I understand what happened.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.239
- Do you always drive like that?
- How?

31:47.406 --> 31:48.908
Dangerously fast.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.410
I don't go fast.
It doesn't feel fast.

31:51.577 --> 31:55.039
Are you kidding?
It sure felt like speeding to me.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.081
Hang on.

31:56.248 --> 32:00.127
Fast is one thing, speed is another,
my little bunny.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.796
Don't call me your little bunny
like your mom.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.089
Okay, bunny!

32:04.256 --> 32:05.591
Cut it out, moron.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.054
Explain your speed thing.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.097
I never feel like I'm going fast.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.893
But speed always feels near,
just in front of me.

32:16.060 --> 32:18.771
So I go faster and faster,
trying to catch it.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.357
But speed always stays
out of reach.

32:21.523 --> 32:24.902
I never feel like I'm going fast
or even accelerating.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.071
- Get it?
- Yeah.

32:27.237 --> 32:30.491
- What if you caught it?
- That's my dream.

32:30.658 --> 32:33.535
It'd be like being
in an invisible bubble

32:33.702 --> 32:36.664
that could take me anywhere
in a split second.

32:36.830 --> 32:40.292
I'd move effortlessly.
No sounds, no vibrations.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.252
Some dream.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.254
You never have dreams like that?

33:25.629 --> 33:27.047
Hey, Chris!

33:27.214 --> 33:28.549
What's up?

33:28.716 --> 33:30.551
This is my friend David.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.219
Nice to meet you.

33:32.386 --> 33:33.345
You screwed me.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.348
- What do you mean?
- My boat, asshole.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.683
You should've told me.

33:37.850 --> 33:41.145
I had to tow it and pay a fine.

33:41.311 --> 33:42.312
Sorry, my fault.

33:42.479 --> 33:45.232
Who asked you, clown?

33:45.399 --> 33:46.900
Don't call me names.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.361
I'll call you what I like, faggot!

33:49.528 --> 33:50.446
Stop!

33:51.447 --> 33:52.364
Stop!

33:56.410 --> 33:57.202
Stop!

33:59.747 --> 34:01.165
Cops!

34:01.331 --> 34:02.750
- Cops!
- David!

34:02.916 --> 34:04.960
Break it up!

34:05.127 --> 34:06.378
Come on, David!

34:06.545 --> 34:07.337
Run!

34:11.258 --> 34:13.302
Grab the helmets!

34:27.149 --> 34:28.484
Wow!

34:28.650 --> 34:30.027
- You got walloped!
- Fuck!

34:32.529 --> 34:34.740
Did you see Chris' face?

34:34.907 --> 34:35.783
Sorry.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.096
Take that off.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.180
Go on.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.267
What a bastard.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.360
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.822
- Feel okay?
- Yeah.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.287
I know what you're
going through is difficult.

36:03.453 --> 36:08.375
Your relationship with David Gorman
is hard for many to understand.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.920
But you're not alone.

36:14.423 --> 36:18.677
What I mean is,
you need to save your skin.

36:18.844 --> 36:22.723
The caseworker and judge
are capable of understanding.

36:22.890 --> 36:26.185
You have no choice,
you must explain.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.812
The story of your "friendship."

36:28.979 --> 36:30.814
The reasons for your behavior.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.357
I can't seem to.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.153
Sometimes it's easier to write.

36:38.614 --> 36:40.782
You know I admire your writing.

36:41.992 --> 36:43.911
Write your story.

36:45.162 --> 36:48.540
Tell it with your words, your emotions.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.875
Your pain.

37:15.359 --> 37:17.069
WHERE DO I START?

37:22.908 --> 37:24.034
Coming?

37:28.538 --> 37:31.124
- Your mother?
- Don't worry, she's asleep.

37:42.344 --> 37:45.555
<i>You want me to describe
what happened behind that door?</i>

37:45.722 --> 37:46.640
<i>Only normal.</i>

37:46.807 --> 37:50.352
<i>We all want to know
the secrets behind closed doors.</i>

37:50.519 --> 37:52.729
<i>But I won't tell you.</i>

37:52.896 --> 37:54.773
<i>Just one thing.</i>

37:54.940 --> 37:57.609
<i>It was the most beautiful night
of my life.</i>

37:57.776 --> 37:59.569
<i>And it was with David.</i>

38:07.327 --> 38:08.745
I gotta go.

38:08.912 --> 38:09.997
Stay.

38:10.163 --> 38:13.125
I can't.
Mom worries and Dad yells.

38:13.292 --> 38:15.502
Tomorrow night?

38:15.669 --> 38:17.838
Okay, but you'll be the death of me.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.093
I'm dead tired already.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.221
You're always talking about death.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.515
It worries you that much?

38:29.683 --> 38:32.227
- No.
- Then why talk about it?

38:32.394 --> 38:33.645
It interests me.

38:34.688 --> 38:35.772
Not you?

38:37.316 --> 38:38.734
Not much.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.277
And your dad?

38:43.447 --> 38:45.157
That's different.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.451
I'm alive and my dad is gone.

38:48.577 --> 38:50.287
I miss him.

38:50.454 --> 38:52.789
That's what's hard about death.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.167
The absence of the ones you loved.

38:56.585 --> 38:59.087
You seem fascinated
by the idea of death.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.342
Yeah, maybe.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.344
Know what we should do
with death?

39:06.678 --> 39:08.138
Laugh in its face.

39:09.598 --> 39:11.683
Easy to say when we're young.

39:18.482 --> 39:21.026
You and I should take an oath.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.903
- An oath?
- Yeah.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.908
Whoever dies first,

39:28.075 --> 39:29.493
the other promises...

39:30.702 --> 39:32.412
to dance on his grave.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.083
See? You're mad.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.042
Think I'm joking?

39:37.209 --> 39:39.211
No, I think you're insane.

39:44.508 --> 39:46.343
Gotta change this hair.

39:46.510 --> 39:49.304
- How so?
- Dunno.

39:49.471 --> 39:51.473
I'll try tomorrow.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.600
- With your magic comb?
- No.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.186
With scissors.

40:02.025 --> 40:03.568
Promise me?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.946
If I die first,
you dance on my grave.

40:06.113 --> 40:09.157
- Don't be dumb.
- I'm very serious.

40:09.324 --> 40:13.453
- You'll live to be 90.
- No buts, just promise.

40:13.620 --> 40:14.913
- Why?
- For me.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.082
- I'm tired, let me go.
- No.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.167
Just promise, no big deal.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.795
- Is it that hard?
- No, but...

40:21.962 --> 40:23.380
I don't understand.

40:23.547 --> 40:26.007
Stop trying to understand everything.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.261
Some things you'll never understand.

40:31.054 --> 40:31.972
So promise.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.898
<i>Why keep arguing?</i>

40:43.567 --> 40:45.986
<i>The friend of my dreams
stood before me</i>

40:46.153 --> 40:48.655
<i>and asked me to take a stupid oath.</i>

40:49.823 --> 40:53.952
<i>At that moment,
there was nothing I could refuse him.</i>

40:54.119 --> 40:55.537
I promise.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.456
For you.

40:57.622 --> 40:58.999
And no other reason.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.980
<i>From beginning to end</i>

41:22.147 --> 41:23.857
<i>was six weeks.</i>

41:24.024 --> 41:25.192
<i>1,008 hours.</i>

41:25.358 --> 41:28.445
<i>60,480 minutes.</i>

41:28.612 --> 41:31.448
<i>3,628,800 seconds.</i>

41:32.866 --> 41:35.660
<i>The whole time,
even up to now,</i>

41:35.827 --> 41:39.372
<i>I wondered, "Why David?</i>

41:39.539 --> 41:41.875
<i>Why him and not another?"</i>

41:42.042 --> 41:44.628
<i>It can't be just his looks.</i>

41:44.794 --> 41:49.132
<i>It can't be just physical, sexual.
Can it?</i>

41:49.299 --> 41:52.093
For codfish and bass,
these are best.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.762
I trust you.

41:55.347 --> 41:58.600
Two packets.
You can exchange.

41:58.767 --> 41:59.935
Now for a rod...

42:00.101 --> 42:02.187
Alex, help me with the rod.

42:02.354 --> 42:05.273
- We're fixing something.
- You're here too?

42:05.440 --> 42:06.900
I didn't know.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.945
This is our latest model...

42:11.029 --> 42:13.990
Highly recommended.
Fantastic.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.119
This is the latest model.

42:18.286 --> 42:20.747
But your husband should come in.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.897
<i>Maybe I loved him.</i>

44:51.064 --> 44:52.190
<i>I believed I did.</i>

44:52.357 --> 44:56.236
<i>I loved him as much as
I understood the meaning of the word.</i>

44:56.403 --> 44:58.905
<i>How do you ever know?</i>

44:59.072 --> 45:02.200
<i>I always thought I'd know
the minute it happened.</i>

45:04.285 --> 45:07.122
<i>But all I knew
was I couldn't get enough of him.</i>

45:08.415 --> 45:12.001
<i>I wanted to spend
every second of my life with him.</i>

45:12.919 --> 45:17.590
<i>But when I was with him,
that wasn't enough either.</i>

45:17.757 --> 45:21.469
<i>I wanted to look at him,
touch him, feel his touch.</i>

45:21.636 --> 45:24.389
<i>I wanted us to be together
all the time,</i>

45:24.556 --> 45:27.183
<i>for 3,628,800 seconds.</i>

46:34.334 --> 46:36.669
I was so worried.

46:36.836 --> 46:40.089
He was keeping bad company.

46:40.256 --> 46:42.383
Got into plenty of trouble.

46:42.550 --> 46:45.595
Running wild night and day.
Worried me sick.

46:47.055 --> 46:50.683
It's not his fault,
he was unhappy.

46:50.850 --> 46:54.729
Now the David we love is back.
Thanks to you.

46:54.896 --> 46:57.816
It's true.
He'd been so unhappy

46:57.982 --> 46:59.776
since his father died.

47:00.819 --> 47:02.445
You do each other good.

47:02.612 --> 47:05.907
- Thanks, Mrs. Gorman.
- No, thank you.

47:06.074 --> 47:08.952
Maybe you can even
improve business together.

47:09.118 --> 47:10.620
Meaning?

47:10.787 --> 47:12.580
I've been thinking.

47:12.747 --> 47:15.708
Why don't you work full-time
in the fall?

47:17.043 --> 47:19.003
It's a good job, good pay.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.798
In a few years,
once you learn the ropes,

47:21.965 --> 47:25.260
we could open a second store
in the tourist area.

47:25.426 --> 47:28.179
That was Simon's dream.

47:28.346 --> 47:29.931
My husband.

47:30.098 --> 47:31.516
What do you say?

47:32.725 --> 47:34.102
Does David want to?

47:34.269 --> 47:37.689
He hasn't said,
but I know he thinks about it.

47:37.856 --> 47:40.942
- Will you think about it too?
- Okay, I will.

47:58.459 --> 48:00.253
Do you mind your mom next door?

48:02.255 --> 48:03.673
Does she mind?

48:04.966 --> 48:08.011
She takes strong sleeping pills
since Dad died.

48:10.555 --> 48:13.099
Think she knows about us?

48:13.266 --> 48:16.019
She's good at seeing
what she wants to see.

48:25.945 --> 48:29.073
<i>"You must forgive us everything.</i>

48:29.240 --> 48:30.575
"That's the way
we'll be happiest,

48:32.702 --> 48:34.871
"And if our lives have moments that sting,

48:35.038 --> 48:37.457
"At least we'll weep together
and be blessed...

48:37.624 --> 48:41.127
"Let's be two children,
let's be two little boys

48:41.294 --> 48:43.755
"In love with nothing,
amazed by all life brings,

48:43.922 --> 48:47.425
"Pale with fear beneath the leaves
chaste curls

48:47.592 --> 48:50.011
Not knowing they've been
forgiven everything."

48:54.599 --> 48:56.601
- Verlaine.
- Yeah.

48:56.768 --> 49:01.022
- They say he wrote it for Rimbaud.
- How do you know it?

49:01.189 --> 49:03.441
Think you're Lefèvre's only pet?

49:05.568 --> 49:08.821
- You had Lefèvre when you quit school?
- Yeah.

49:08.988 --> 49:11.783
He was furious when I left.

49:11.950 --> 49:14.160
He said I was betraying my talent,

49:14.327 --> 49:17.455
wasting my life
with an abusive mother.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.332
Fucker didn't spare me.

49:19.499 --> 49:22.293
Did you tell him about the shop
and your father?

49:22.460 --> 49:24.087
He must've understood.

49:24.253 --> 49:25.964
Did you?

49:26.130 --> 49:28.132
Not at first, but I have lately.

49:28.299 --> 49:30.843
Should we hire Lefèvre?

49:31.010 --> 49:32.595
That'd be funny.

49:32.762 --> 49:34.555
For you.

49:34.722 --> 49:36.140
Not for the customers.

49:39.185 --> 49:41.145
Still think about it?

49:41.312 --> 49:43.189
Lefèvre or leaving school?

49:43.356 --> 49:44.816
Both.

49:47.527 --> 49:49.445
No, not really.

49:51.114 --> 49:52.281
And your father?

49:53.992 --> 49:55.118
Always.

50:00.873 --> 50:02.458
Was he the oath?

50:03.543 --> 50:05.044
What?

50:05.211 --> 50:07.255
Did he ask you
to dance on his grave?

50:08.840 --> 50:09.799
No.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.179
I would've loved that.

50:35.491 --> 50:37.994
You always wear the same clothes.
Having money problems?

50:38.161 --> 50:40.121
- It's not just that.
- Why, then?

50:40.288 --> 50:43.207
I never know what suits me.
I see things I like.

50:43.374 --> 50:45.293
- Yeah.
- Like this.

50:45.460 --> 50:47.086
Then it doesn't suit me.

50:47.253 --> 50:48.546
This would suit you.

50:49.672 --> 50:52.008
- Shut up.
- You'd get me even hotter.

50:52.175 --> 50:53.843
Pervert. Get off me.

50:55.053 --> 50:56.179
Come on.

50:56.345 --> 50:58.556
Let's give you a makeover!

51:04.062 --> 51:05.188
Not bad.

51:06.564 --> 51:07.690
Try this.

51:11.569 --> 51:13.571
- How much is this?
- 149 francs.

51:16.699 --> 51:18.367
Try this first.

51:45.353 --> 51:46.229
Alexis!

52:25.685 --> 52:28.062
- Hello, Alex!
- Kate!

52:30.356 --> 52:34.110
I don't usually have such an effect.

52:34.277 --> 52:36.028
Kate, meet David.

52:36.195 --> 52:39.240
Kate's an au pair
improving her French.

52:39.407 --> 52:40.533
Nice to meet you.

52:40.700 --> 52:43.411
I saw you two on a boat.

52:43.578 --> 52:45.746
- It had a nice name.
- Calypso?

52:45.913 --> 52:46.998
Calypso, that's it.

52:47.165 --> 52:48.791
My father named it.

52:48.958 --> 52:50.251
He was a sailor.

52:51.419 --> 52:52.670
Rather beautiful.

52:52.837 --> 52:55.006
Thank you.

52:55.173 --> 52:58.009
- We could take Kate out sometime.
- Sure.

52:58.176 --> 53:00.261
- I'd love that.
- Really?

53:00.428 --> 53:03.723
- Can you sail?
- If someone explains it to me.

53:03.890 --> 53:05.641
Don't worry, he'll explain.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.393
Are you a good swimmer?

53:07.560 --> 53:09.729
- I think so.
- Alex here...

53:10.813 --> 53:12.356
excels at capsizing.

53:12.523 --> 53:13.482
Stop it.

53:13.649 --> 53:15.443
- No?
- No.

53:15.610 --> 53:17.904
Then you should stay in charge.

53:18.070 --> 53:20.489
Don't worry, he will.

53:20.656 --> 53:22.700
- Let's go now.
- Where?

53:22.867 --> 53:24.243
On the Calypso.

53:24.410 --> 53:25.536
Why not?

53:25.703 --> 53:27.455
- Got your stuff?
- Over there.

53:27.622 --> 53:29.081
Let's go.

53:29.248 --> 53:30.708
Wait a sec.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.627
Get your stuff and join us.

53:44.555 --> 53:46.641
<i>That was how the end began.</i>

53:48.559 --> 53:53.189
<i>Trouble is, there's so much
I don't remember about the end,</i>

53:53.356 --> 53:57.777
<i>making it hard to tell the police,
the judge or the caseworker.</i>

54:02.114 --> 54:05.076
<i>Other things I remember in great detail.</i>

54:05.243 --> 54:07.912
<i>The rescue, our first night,</i>

54:08.079 --> 54:10.373
<i>the excitement at the movies,</i>

54:10.539 --> 54:12.291
<i>our motorcycle rides.</i>

54:12.458 --> 54:15.419
<i>I can describe them
heartbeat by heartbeat.</i>

54:16.462 --> 54:18.798
<i>They were great moments.</i>

54:18.965 --> 54:21.884
<i>Made great by being together.</i>

54:22.051 --> 54:23.302
<i>Nothing else.</i>

54:24.637 --> 54:27.932
<i>But the beginning of the end
was not a great moment.</i>

54:28.099 --> 54:29.976
<i>It was trivial.</i>

54:30.142 --> 54:31.686
<i>Ordinary.</i>

54:31.852 --> 54:33.396
<i>And dead sad.</i>

54:34.772 --> 54:36.774
Hello, sir.
Have a nice day.

54:43.155 --> 54:43.948
Hi, handsome!

54:46.117 --> 54:48.202
How's business?

54:48.369 --> 54:50.955
- Slow.
- Tough shit.

54:51.122 --> 54:53.833
- Have a good night?
- Yeah.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.377
Full of contortions
and erotic sensations.

54:56.544 --> 54:58.254
I can tell from here.

54:58.421 --> 55:00.298
- Really?
- I had a good teacher.

55:00.673 --> 55:02.633
By the way, no class today.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.052
So what?
I didn't sign up for English.

55:08.723 --> 55:10.266
Bit cranky this morning?

55:10.433 --> 55:12.226
Bit obnoxious this morning?

55:12.393 --> 55:14.312
Don't push your luck.

55:14.478 --> 55:16.063
- Me pushing my luck?
- Yeah.

55:16.230 --> 55:17.481
Look who's talking.

55:18.524 --> 55:19.942
You don't own me, pal.

55:20.109 --> 55:21.944
Did I say I did?

55:22.111 --> 55:25.156
- Don't call me pal.
- Sorry, little bunny.

55:26.532 --> 55:28.159
I thought we were friends.

55:28.326 --> 55:30.786
Bit more than friends, no?

55:30.953 --> 55:33.664
You came after me, remember.

55:33.831 --> 55:34.957
I came after you?

55:35.124 --> 55:36.876
- No I didn't.
- What?

55:37.043 --> 55:39.462
- Wishful thinking.
- You hit on me!

55:39.628 --> 55:43.090
You came to my rescue,
waving my jeans in the air!

55:43.257 --> 55:46.510
You gave me a bath,
loaned me your clothes,

55:46.677 --> 55:48.971
made eyes at me as we ate!

55:49.138 --> 55:51.349
Fondled me at the cinema!

55:51.515 --> 55:53.809
Calm the fuck down!

55:54.852 --> 55:57.146
I don't remember you resisting.

55:58.564 --> 55:59.565
Hello, ma'am.

55:59.732 --> 56:01.359
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

56:01.525 --> 56:04.403
- How can I help you?
- I'd like a rod.

56:10.451 --> 56:11.494
Why?

56:13.621 --> 56:15.623
What does it matter?

56:15.790 --> 56:18.626
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing at all?

56:18.793 --> 56:21.295
Nothing worth bothering about.

56:21.462 --> 56:23.047
I want to understand why.

56:24.632 --> 56:26.509
- You're getting annoying.
- Tell me.

56:26.675 --> 56:28.469
It's happened before.

56:28.636 --> 56:31.555
No big deal.
You didn't shit bricks before.

56:31.722 --> 56:33.682
- This is different.
- Because it's a girl?

56:33.849 --> 56:35.893
- No.
- Then why?

56:36.060 --> 56:39.146
You dropped me like an old sock.

56:39.313 --> 56:42.983
You seduced her on the boat
like I wasn't there.

56:43.150 --> 56:48.072
Made me dock the boat
while you played with your new toy.

56:48.239 --> 56:51.492
You dump me,
then act like all is well!

56:51.659 --> 56:55.162
I'm not a maid at your service, pal!

56:55.329 --> 56:56.789
Are you done?

56:56.956 --> 56:58.290
No, tell me why.

56:58.457 --> 57:01.001
You don't really want to know.

57:01.168 --> 57:04.380
I think you're just jealous.
It'll pass.

57:04.547 --> 57:06.090
- Don't patronize me!
- I'm explaining.

57:06.257 --> 57:09.385
You call this an explanation?

57:09.552 --> 57:10.761
Okay, know what?

57:10.928 --> 57:12.680
Let's make peace.

57:13.848 --> 57:16.016
I behaved badly. Sorry.

57:17.226 --> 57:20.521
We go back to how we were,
forget this, and be happy.

57:20.688 --> 57:22.565
Stop it!

57:22.731 --> 57:23.941
Not this time.

57:28.028 --> 57:30.030
<i>I don't know when I decided.</i>

57:30.197 --> 57:32.450
<i>Right then, I guess.</i>

57:32.616 --> 57:35.411
<i>As soon as I said it,
I knew I'd regret it.</i>

57:36.704 --> 57:38.581
<i>Deep silence.</i>

57:38.747 --> 57:40.875
<i>Eyes on eyes, waiting.</i>

57:42.877 --> 57:45.463
<i>It was the saddest moment
of my life.</i>

57:45.629 --> 57:49.091
Careful, Alex.
Some things are better left unsaid.

57:49.258 --> 57:51.051
You can't take them back.

57:51.218 --> 57:53.929
Like oaths of eternal friendship?

57:54.096 --> 57:56.140
Swearing to dance on graves?

57:56.307 --> 57:57.766
Is that what you mean?

58:02.855 --> 58:04.982
You want to know?

58:05.149 --> 58:07.318
Okay, I'll tell you.

58:07.485 --> 58:09.445
I'm getting bored.

58:09.612 --> 58:12.114
- Bored?
- Bored, yes.

58:12.281 --> 58:13.824
With what?

58:13.991 --> 58:16.577
- With who.
- What, who?

58:16.744 --> 58:17.703
You.

58:19.330 --> 58:21.040
Me?

58:21.207 --> 58:22.166
You.

58:25.127 --> 58:26.754
Weren't we happy?

58:26.921 --> 58:29.381
That's the fucking problem.

58:31.217 --> 58:32.593
You're happy.

58:32.760 --> 58:34.512
Totally.

58:34.678 --> 58:36.347
I was happy.

58:36.514 --> 58:38.098
We were happy together, but...

58:39.767 --> 58:40.768
not anymore.

58:43.646 --> 58:46.357
You should've said.
We can do other things--

58:46.524 --> 58:50.110
- That's not the point.
- So what is?

58:50.277 --> 58:52.696
- I told you, it's you!
- What about me?

58:52.863 --> 58:55.157
It's you, you bore me!

58:58.994 --> 59:00.913
We had some good times.

59:01.080 --> 59:02.831
I had a blast with you.

59:04.625 --> 59:05.960
But I like change.

59:07.836 --> 59:08.712
See?

59:08.879 --> 59:11.882
I want different people.
One's not enough.

59:12.049 --> 59:13.008
Not for me.

59:21.058 --> 59:21.892
Okay.

59:22.977 --> 59:24.770
I came after you.

59:24.937 --> 59:27.022
I was into you right away.

59:28.983 --> 59:30.901
I thought we were the same.

59:31.068 --> 59:32.528
I thought you just...

59:32.695 --> 59:36.365
wanted to have fun
and do tons of stuff together!

59:39.410 --> 59:41.245
But what we do doesn't matter.

59:43.622 --> 59:44.623
It's me.

59:46.625 --> 59:47.918
It's me you want.

59:52.464 --> 59:54.049
And that's impossible, Alex.

59:56.051 --> 59:57.011
I'm sorry.

1:00:01.890 --> 1:00:03.392
It's too heavy for me.

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:09.398
I won't be owned.

1:00:11.150 --> 1:00:12.359
Not by anyone.

1:00:14.486 --> 1:00:15.821
Ever.

1:00:24.663 --> 1:00:26.081
Alex, come back!

1:00:40.554 --> 1:00:42.181
What the hell happened?

1:00:45.225 --> 1:00:46.352
David?

1:00:48.020 --> 1:00:50.147
Alex! Are you here?

1:00:52.441 --> 1:00:54.943
David, what happened?

1:00:57.279 --> 1:01:00.449
Did you do this?
Where's Alex?

1:01:05.788 --> 1:01:07.039
Home already?

1:01:07.206 --> 1:01:08.749
I'm going to my room.

1:01:42.449 --> 1:01:45.369
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

1:01:45.536 --> 1:01:48.455
- Eating with us?
- Yeah.

1:01:48.622 --> 1:01:50.290
Your dad will be happy.

1:01:52.084 --> 1:01:55.045
<i>...speeding, missed a curve.</i>

1:01:55.212 --> 1:01:58.757
<i>Several witnesses were on the scene.</i>

1:01:58.924 --> 1:02:00.801
<i>What did you see?</i>

1:02:00.968 --> 1:02:02.594
<i>It seemed he was trying to fly.</i>

1:02:02.761 --> 1:02:05.431
<i>He must've been drunk, stoned</i>

1:02:05.597 --> 1:02:07.975
<i>or crazy. He had no helmet.</i>

1:02:08.142 --> 1:02:09.184
<i>It was shocking.</i>

1:02:10.936 --> 1:02:12.229
Leaving already?

1:03:00.611 --> 1:03:03.030
Mrs. Gorman, let me in!

1:03:03.197 --> 1:03:06.116
- Mrs. Gorman!
- Please go away.

1:03:06.283 --> 1:03:07.993
What happened?

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:09.369
Tell me!

1:03:09.536 --> 1:03:12.122
- You don't know?
- No.

1:03:12.289 --> 1:03:14.583
David just died.
My son is dead.

1:03:16.376 --> 1:03:18.754
You killed him.

1:03:18.921 --> 1:03:22.090
Get out of here
or I'll call the police.

1:03:23.217 --> 1:03:24.760
Disappear!

1:03:55.332 --> 1:03:58.293
<i>I thought, it was my fault.</i>

1:03:58.460 --> 1:04:01.588
<i>He died in anger, because of me.</i>

1:04:01.755 --> 1:04:02.881
<i>No.</i>

1:04:03.048 --> 1:04:05.509
<i>He was glad to be rid of me,</i>

1:04:05.676 --> 1:04:07.845
<i>so he rode fast to celebrate.</i>

1:04:08.011 --> 1:04:10.973
<i>He was finally inside
his timeless bubble.</i>

1:04:12.099 --> 1:04:13.600
<i>Did he dream it?</i>

1:04:13.767 --> 1:04:16.186
<i>Was he trying to live his dream?</i>

1:04:17.396 --> 1:04:19.231
<i>No, none of that.</i>

1:04:19.398 --> 1:04:20.732
<i>It was Kate's fault.</i>

1:04:23.235 --> 1:04:25.279
<i>Not that he loved her. No.</i>

1:04:25.445 --> 1:04:27.656
<i>He regretted being with her.</i>

1:04:29.575 --> 1:04:31.326
<i>He died full of remorse.</i>

1:04:33.871 --> 1:04:38.000
<i>I kept thinking it was all my fault.</i>

1:04:38.166 --> 1:04:40.335
<i>If I'd come back when he called...</i>

1:04:40.502 --> 1:04:42.045
<i>But did he call?</i>

1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:45.841
<i>I wish I'd been on the bike with him.</i>

1:04:49.595 --> 1:04:51.013
<i>I kept thinking,</i>

1:04:52.306 --> 1:04:54.433
<i>David's not dead, he can't be.</i>

1:04:55.809 --> 1:04:57.769
<i>I want him to still be here.</i>

1:04:59.479 --> 1:05:03.150
Mom's worried.
She sent me up with coffee.

1:05:03.317 --> 1:05:05.777
You didn't say a word last night.

1:05:05.944 --> 1:05:07.279
You didn't eat.

1:05:07.446 --> 1:05:09.740
Sorry, I'm not well.

1:05:09.907 --> 1:05:11.658
What is it now?

1:05:11.825 --> 1:05:13.327
You don't know?

1:05:13.493 --> 1:05:15.454
How can we?
You never tell us.

1:05:19.124 --> 1:05:20.626
David Gorman is dead.

1:05:22.085 --> 1:05:24.296
The boy from the shop?

1:05:24.463 --> 1:05:25.881
Yes.

1:05:26.048 --> 1:05:27.758
Motorcycle accident.

1:05:33.722 --> 1:05:36.141
You hadn't known him long.

1:05:36.308 --> 1:05:37.643
Six weeks.

1:05:41.688 --> 1:05:43.190
These things happen.

1:05:46.068 --> 1:05:48.820
How's Mrs. Gorman holding up?

1:05:48.987 --> 1:05:50.030
Badly.

1:05:52.324 --> 1:05:53.492
Only normal.

1:05:55.827 --> 1:05:57.537
She'll be needing help.

1:05:59.998 --> 1:06:02.459
You could help her in the shop.

1:06:02.626 --> 1:06:05.087
She was kind, paid you well.

1:06:05.253 --> 1:06:07.506
Show her she can count on you.

1:06:10.008 --> 1:06:12.177
Get up and go to work, okay?

1:06:15.597 --> 1:06:16.390
Good.

1:06:20.185 --> 1:06:23.689
If you need anything, any help...

1:06:23.855 --> 1:06:25.023
we're here for you.

1:06:27.776 --> 1:06:29.027
I'm off.

1:06:29.194 --> 1:06:30.862
I'll tell Mom you're coming.

1:07:44.394 --> 1:07:45.479
Who's there?

1:07:45.645 --> 1:07:46.521
Anyone?

1:07:47.481 --> 1:07:49.107
No, Mrs. Gorman.

1:07:49.274 --> 1:07:50.859
It's me, Alex.

1:07:52.486 --> 1:07:55.405
I wanted to ask you something.

1:07:55.572 --> 1:07:57.491
Have you no pity?

1:07:57.657 --> 1:07:59.159
No decency?

1:07:59.326 --> 1:08:02.537
I have to see David.
I have to see his body.

1:08:02.704 --> 1:08:04.247
One last time.

1:08:04.414 --> 1:08:06.625
It's important to me.

1:08:06.792 --> 1:08:08.960
I trusted you.

1:08:09.127 --> 1:08:12.255
Look how you paid us back.

1:08:12.422 --> 1:08:14.883
Please, I want to see him.
I have to.

1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:19.262
I loved him too, you know?

1:08:20.222 --> 1:08:22.349
How dare you say such a thing?

1:08:23.517 --> 1:08:25.894
He'd be alive
if he hadn't gone after you.

1:08:26.603 --> 1:08:29.231
Gone after me? How so?

1:08:30.649 --> 1:08:33.902
He told me everything.
Showed me what you broke.

1:08:35.695 --> 1:08:38.198
He took the bike
and went to find you.

1:08:38.365 --> 1:08:41.118
I couldn't stop him.

1:08:48.792 --> 1:08:51.503
I knew my David needed a friend.

1:08:51.670 --> 1:08:54.798
A real friend.
I gave him his freedom.

1:08:56.341 --> 1:08:58.510
Look at the result.

1:08:58.677 --> 1:09:00.679
He's gone to join his father.

1:09:05.976 --> 1:09:08.019
You'll never see him again.

1:09:08.186 --> 1:09:10.021
You hear me?

1:09:10.188 --> 1:09:11.314
Never.

1:09:47.225 --> 1:09:49.853
<i>A sentence rang out clear as a bell.</i>

1:09:52.063 --> 1:09:54.482
<i>"I should die to join David."</i>

1:09:56.484 --> 1:09:58.528
<i>But how?</i>

1:09:58.695 --> 1:09:59.946
<i>Pills?</i>

1:10:01.573 --> 1:10:02.908
<i>Slit throat?</i>

1:10:04.034 --> 1:10:05.368
<i>Slit wrists?</i>

1:10:07.621 --> 1:10:08.413
<i>Poison?</i>

1:10:10.290 --> 1:10:11.333
<i>Suffocation?</i>

1:10:13.001 --> 1:10:14.794
<i>Hanging?</i>

1:10:14.961 --> 1:10:16.588
<i>Find a gun?</i>

1:10:18.590 --> 1:10:21.927
<i>I read about a tribe
whose members could lie down</i>

1:10:22.093 --> 1:10:24.471
<i>and will themselves to die.</i>

1:10:24.638 --> 1:10:26.848
<i>I tried for half an hour.</i>

1:10:27.015 --> 1:10:29.476
<i>It didn't work.</i>

1:10:29.643 --> 1:10:31.019
<i>I'd have to take action.</i>

1:10:36.399 --> 1:10:38.485
<i>Lefèvre was right.</i>

1:10:38.652 --> 1:10:40.612
<i>The only way back to David</i>

1:10:40.779 --> 1:10:42.322
<i>was to write.</i>

1:10:42.489 --> 1:10:44.783
<i>Tell our story.</i>

1:10:44.950 --> 1:10:47.661
<i>Bring him back to life with words.</i>

1:10:53.875 --> 1:10:57.712
I got the hearing postponed
and told Alexis we need his text.

1:10:57.879 --> 1:11:00.882
- Any news?
- Yes, he's writing all the time.

1:11:01.049 --> 1:11:03.093
I think it's been therapeutic.

1:11:03.260 --> 1:11:05.136
Could I read some?

1:11:05.303 --> 1:11:07.847
It's too soon, we shouldn't interrupt.

1:11:08.014 --> 1:11:10.225
You don't have to tell him.

1:11:10.392 --> 1:11:12.602
Ever heard of confidentiality?

1:11:12.769 --> 1:11:14.271
Teachers have ethics too.

1:11:14.437 --> 1:11:16.982
Hurry him up.
I don't need a novel.

1:11:17.148 --> 1:11:22.737
Funny you say that.
He may indeed be writing one.

1:11:22.904 --> 1:11:25.740
Just make sure
he's not making anything up.

1:11:41.172 --> 1:11:42.674
It's terrible.

1:11:42.841 --> 1:11:45.468
I can't stop crying.

1:11:45.635 --> 1:11:47.637
How'd you find out?

1:11:47.804 --> 1:11:50.807
I called his house and got his Mom.

1:11:50.974 --> 1:11:53.560
- She's in bad shape.
- Yeah.

1:11:53.727 --> 1:11:56.146
- She never wants to see me again.
- Why?

1:11:56.313 --> 1:11:58.732
You and David
were such good friends.

1:12:00.066 --> 1:12:01.776
Not only friends.

1:12:03.236 --> 1:12:05.822
What's that mean in French?

1:12:09.075 --> 1:12:11.870
Does it mean more than friends?

1:12:13.997 --> 1:12:16.666
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1:12:16.833 --> 1:12:18.376
You couldn't know.

1:12:18.543 --> 1:12:20.086
I should've guessed.

1:12:24.924 --> 1:12:26.843
Are you shocked?

1:12:27.010 --> 1:12:28.219
No.

1:12:28.386 --> 1:12:30.430
Just surprised.

1:12:30.597 --> 1:12:32.640
Because he slept with you too.

1:12:34.851 --> 1:12:36.519
You know?

1:12:36.686 --> 1:12:38.730
We even fought over it.

1:12:47.197 --> 1:12:49.240
Can I tell you everything, Kate?

1:12:52.118 --> 1:12:53.453
Yes, I'd like that.

1:12:56.539 --> 1:13:00.377
<i>Had I thought about it,
Kate would've been the last person</i>

1:13:00.543 --> 1:13:02.253
<i>I'd have wanted to be with.</i>

1:13:04.255 --> 1:13:05.131
<i>But in truth,</i>

1:13:05.298 --> 1:13:10.136
<i>Kate was the only one
I could confide in about David and me.</i>

1:13:10.303 --> 1:13:11.971
<i>So I told her everything.</i>

1:13:13.681 --> 1:13:15.892
<i>Sometimes we laughed.</i>

1:13:16.059 --> 1:13:18.978
<i>First time I'd laughed in 48 hours.</i>

1:13:20.855 --> 1:13:23.233
<i>Now and then she asked a question.</i>

1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:25.527
<i>Towards the end she wept.</i>

1:13:25.693 --> 1:13:27.695
<i>Softly,</i>

1:13:27.862 --> 1:13:29.614
<i>without a word,</i>

1:13:29.781 --> 1:13:31.199
<i>and without fuss.</i>

1:13:32.492 --> 1:13:34.828
I haven't told you everything, Kate.

1:13:34.994 --> 1:13:37.122
I want to know everything.

1:13:37.288 --> 1:13:40.708
When we met, David made me swear
that whoever died first,

1:13:40.875 --> 1:13:42.794
the other would dance on his grave.

1:13:42.961 --> 1:13:44.587
That's weird.

1:13:44.754 --> 1:13:46.673
- I know.
- You won't do it?

1:13:47.882 --> 1:13:50.969
A promise is a promise.
I have no choice.

1:13:57.434 --> 1:13:58.852
Maybe you can help me.

1:13:59.018 --> 1:14:00.770
- Dance?
- No, I do that.

1:14:00.937 --> 1:14:02.647
Then how?

1:14:02.814 --> 1:14:05.900
It may be even weirder,
but I need to see his body.

1:14:06.067 --> 1:14:07.152
What?

1:14:07.318 --> 1:14:09.779
I know it's crazy, but I need to.

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:12.740
To be sure he's really dead.

1:14:12.907 --> 1:14:14.576
Poor Alex.

1:14:14.742 --> 1:14:16.661
It wasn't just a fling.

1:14:24.043 --> 1:14:25.003
Hello.

1:14:27.672 --> 1:14:28.798
Hello, Alexis.

1:14:28.965 --> 1:14:30.341
Hello, Mr. Lefèvre.

1:14:30.508 --> 1:14:33.136
So, got something I can read?

1:14:33.303 --> 1:14:34.971
Yes.
I've made progress.

1:14:35.138 --> 1:14:39.142
But... it's complicated.
I hope you'll like it.

1:14:39.309 --> 1:14:41.227
Let's have a look.

1:14:52.322 --> 1:14:53.615
Here, put these on.

1:14:53.781 --> 1:14:54.866
What are they?

1:14:57.327 --> 1:14:58.328
No way, never.

1:14:58.495 --> 1:15:01.372
In jeans you look like a boy.
Gotta show your legs.

1:15:01.539 --> 1:15:03.416
Otherwise, we shave.

1:15:03.583 --> 1:15:05.168
- Being a girl sucks.
- Yep.

1:15:05.335 --> 1:15:08.922
Men like girls' legs soft and hairless.

1:15:09.088 --> 1:15:11.549
You can still change your mind.

1:15:11.716 --> 1:15:16.095
<i>There's always a fateful moment
when you realize if you keep going,</i>

1:15:16.262 --> 1:15:19.224
<i>there's no turning back.</i>

1:15:19.390 --> 1:15:22.477
<i>I learned it that day,
thanks to Kate.</i>

1:15:22.644 --> 1:15:24.479
Would David find this sexy?

1:15:24.646 --> 1:15:27.565
I don't know.
You knew him better than I did.

1:15:27.732 --> 1:15:29.943
But I think you're super sexy.

1:15:32.820 --> 1:15:33.988
Let's leave them here.

1:15:41.079 --> 1:15:42.705
- Stay there.
- Okay.

1:15:57.136 --> 1:15:58.888
All good! But hurry.

1:15:59.055 --> 1:16:01.683
It's against the rules,
he could be fired.

1:16:01.849 --> 1:16:02.850
How'd you do it?

1:16:04.018 --> 1:16:06.062
His name is Bernard.
You're Susanne.

1:16:06.229 --> 1:16:07.855
I hate that name!

1:16:08.022 --> 1:16:09.816
It's my sister's name. Come on.

1:16:09.983 --> 1:16:11.943
Focus on your character,

1:16:12.110 --> 1:16:16.906
a girl in love who wants to see
her lover's body one last time.

1:16:17.073 --> 1:16:21.077
His mother forbid it.
She was against your relationship.

1:16:21.244 --> 1:16:23.246
No need to play a girl for that.

1:16:23.413 --> 1:16:26.124
The guard may not like
two boys in love!

1:16:26.291 --> 1:16:27.709
Come on.

1:16:31.462 --> 1:16:33.756
This way, girls. Quickly.

1:16:37.927 --> 1:16:39.429
So very tragic.

1:16:39.596 --> 1:16:42.181
Young love breaks my heart.

1:16:49.606 --> 1:16:51.566
Never seen a place like this?

1:16:53.109 --> 1:16:53.985
No, sir.

1:16:54.152 --> 1:16:55.945
I'm not allowed to do this.

1:16:56.112 --> 1:16:57.238
We know.

1:17:00.408 --> 1:17:01.743
She's a quiet one.

1:17:01.909 --> 1:17:03.786
Susanne is devastated.

1:17:03.953 --> 1:17:05.997
It's been horrible for her.

1:17:06.164 --> 1:17:07.373
I understand.

1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:10.209
Ever seen a corpse,
Susanne dear?

1:17:11.836 --> 1:17:13.296
Are you up to it?

1:18:02.011 --> 1:18:04.722
<i>I can't take my eyes off that head</i>

1:18:04.889 --> 1:18:07.433
<i>lying flat on the metal tray.</i>

1:18:09.852 --> 1:18:11.646
<i>I wish for only one thing.</i>

1:18:12.522 --> 1:18:13.940
<i>For his eyes to open.</i>

1:18:15.191 --> 1:18:16.776
<i>For his mouth to speak.</i>

1:18:17.902 --> 1:18:19.529
<i>For his hands to caress me.</i>

1:18:20.697 --> 1:18:22.615
<i>For his heart to beat.</i>

1:18:22.782 --> 1:18:25.910
<i>For his body to be him again, David.</i>

1:18:30.415 --> 1:18:32.917
What's the matter with you?

1:18:33.084 --> 1:18:34.377
- Get off!
- Alex!

1:18:35.628 --> 1:18:36.421
Alex?

1:18:37.588 --> 1:18:38.631
What on earth?

1:18:54.230 --> 1:18:55.314
My god!

1:18:55.481 --> 1:18:57.066
What? Oh...

1:18:57.233 --> 1:18:58.901
Wearing makeup now?

1:18:59.068 --> 1:19:02.447
No, a friend is putting on a play.

1:19:02.613 --> 1:19:05.908
I thought you were like Uncle Jackie.

1:19:06.075 --> 1:19:09.162
- Uncle Jackie?
- Your dad can't hear his name.

1:19:09.328 --> 1:19:11.998
Uncle Jackie dresses like a woman?

1:19:12.165 --> 1:19:14.584
Don't worry, I won't say anything.

1:19:14.751 --> 1:19:16.627
Wash up before Dad...

1:19:16.794 --> 1:19:19.630
Hang on, where's Uncle Jackie now?

1:19:19.797 --> 1:19:22.133
Hurry, Dad'll be home soon.

1:19:22.300 --> 1:19:23.217
Right.

1:19:26.387 --> 1:19:27.889
Alexis?

1:19:28.055 --> 1:19:29.140
Yeah?

1:19:30.057 --> 1:19:31.267
Are you okay?

1:19:32.310 --> 1:19:33.853
I'm fine, Mom.

1:19:38.775 --> 1:19:41.235
- This really happened?
- Yes.

1:19:41.402 --> 1:19:42.904
Did you exaggerate?

1:19:43.070 --> 1:19:45.615
I tried to tell it
the best I could, in detail.

1:19:46.657 --> 1:19:49.994
Some words were hard to find,
but I managed.

1:19:50.161 --> 1:19:51.412
Indeed you did.

1:19:51.579 --> 1:19:54.415
It's strange.
Since I started writing,

1:19:54.582 --> 1:19:57.376
I feel like I've become
a character myself.

1:19:57.543 --> 1:19:58.669
Does it scare you?

1:19:58.836 --> 1:20:00.421
No, it feels good.

1:20:00.588 --> 1:20:04.217
It forces me to focus less on my pain
and more on the story,

1:20:04.383 --> 1:20:07.136
the characters and the writing.

1:20:07.303 --> 1:20:11.516
Time to write the climax.
The caseworker and judge are waiting.

1:20:11.682 --> 1:20:14.143
- The crime scene, the cemetery.
- I know.

1:20:16.312 --> 1:20:18.356
That's the hardest part to tell.

1:20:22.485 --> 1:20:25.404
Mind if I let Miss Martin
read some of this,

1:20:25.571 --> 1:20:26.906
to reassure her?

1:20:27.073 --> 1:20:29.367
- That I'm not crazy?
- Yeah.

1:20:29.534 --> 1:20:30.785
If you like.

1:20:34.956 --> 1:20:37.500
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:40.878
Did you know David well?

1:20:41.045 --> 1:20:42.046
Yes.

1:20:43.506 --> 1:20:45.132
Did he seduce you too?

1:20:46.884 --> 1:20:48.386
Yes.

1:20:48.553 --> 1:20:50.179
But he was a student.

1:20:50.346 --> 1:20:51.931
And I was his teacher.

1:22:12.386 --> 1:22:14.263
- Hello?
<i>- Mrs. Gorman?</i>

1:22:14.430 --> 1:22:16.599
I realized I have no photo of David.

1:22:16.766 --> 1:22:18.267
Could you give me one?

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:21.145
<i>Hello?</i>

1:22:21.312 --> 1:22:22.438
<i>Are you there?</i>

1:22:22.605 --> 1:22:25.274
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, sir, it's Alex.</i>

1:22:25.441 --> 1:22:27.526
Stop calling or we'll call the police.

1:22:27.693 --> 1:22:29.487
I just need a photo...

1:22:29.654 --> 1:22:30.655
Enough!

1:22:30.821 --> 1:22:34.367
I see him dead!
I want to remember him alive...

1:22:41.165 --> 1:22:44.126
<i>David would be buried
in a matter of days.</i>

1:22:44.293 --> 1:22:47.630
<i>I needed to know
all about Jewish funeral rites.</i>

1:22:47.797 --> 1:22:52.176
<i>Preparation of the body,
the wake, the burial...</i>

1:22:52.343 --> 1:22:56.263
<i>I learned that they wait
at least a year after the burial</i>

1:22:56.430 --> 1:22:57.974
<i>before erecting a headstone.</i>

1:23:00.935 --> 1:23:03.479
<i>How will I recognize his grave?</i>

1:23:20.997 --> 1:23:22.331
What're you doing?

1:23:22.498 --> 1:23:24.166
Going out for air.

1:23:24.333 --> 1:23:26.460
At 2:00 in the morning?
You'll catch cold.

1:23:26.627 --> 1:23:28.421
Don't worry, I'll dress warm.

1:23:32.842 --> 1:23:34.844
We shouldn't have moved.

1:23:35.928 --> 1:23:38.931
We were at home there,
everything was simpler.

1:23:39.098 --> 1:23:41.350
We're here now.
Everything's fine.

1:23:41.517 --> 1:23:43.310
Go back to bed.

1:23:43.477 --> 1:23:45.563
Can I make you something warm?

1:23:45.730 --> 1:23:47.481
I'm not hungry, I just need air.

1:23:47.648 --> 1:23:49.442
I've been in bed too long.

1:23:57.867 --> 1:24:01.537
Don't go far.
You never know who might be out there.

1:24:01.704 --> 1:24:03.122
Go back to bed.

1:24:11.547 --> 1:24:12.423
Mom?

1:24:14.425 --> 1:24:16.427
Did you like Uncle Jackie?

1:24:19.597 --> 1:24:20.806
Yes.

1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:27.433
<i>I don't know how long the fit lasted.</i>

1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:28.976
<i>I'd gone mad.</i>

1:26:30.269 --> 1:26:31.687
<i>Completely mad.</i>

1:26:32.897 --> 1:26:35.191
<i>What was I digging for?</i>

1:26:37.693 --> 1:26:39.778
<i>Was I trying to join David?</i>

1:26:39.945 --> 1:26:41.197
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:26:42.990 --> 1:26:44.825
<i>But I still hadn't danced.</i>

1:26:47.453 --> 1:26:48.871
Dad?

1:26:49.038 --> 1:26:49.914
Yes?

1:26:51.332 --> 1:26:54.460
Remember you said
to ask if I needed help?

1:26:54.627 --> 1:26:55.586
Yes.

1:26:57.504 --> 1:27:00.299
I need to deliver this letter.
Would you?

1:27:03.510 --> 1:27:04.845
A girl?

1:27:05.012 --> 1:27:06.263
A friend.

1:27:06.430 --> 1:27:09.475
With my bad foot,
it's better if she comes here.

1:27:09.642 --> 1:27:11.268
Is she pretty?

1:27:11.435 --> 1:27:13.312
She's English.

1:27:13.479 --> 1:27:15.606
A foreigner?

1:27:15.773 --> 1:27:17.316
England's not in France, Dad.

1:27:22.404 --> 1:27:24.031
Mind if she comes?

1:27:24.198 --> 1:27:26.700
Check with your mother.

1:27:26.867 --> 1:27:29.203
But will you take her my letter?

1:27:29.370 --> 1:27:31.413
If it'll do you good, yes.

1:27:32.748 --> 1:27:33.832
Thanks, Dad.

1:27:40.297 --> 1:27:43.509
<i>Thinking back on that scene,
maybe Dad knew.</i>

1:27:43.676 --> 1:27:47.012
<i>He understood David
was more than a friend.</i>

1:27:47.179 --> 1:27:50.766
<i>Perhaps one day,
we'll be able to talk about it.</i>

1:27:59.775 --> 1:28:01.235
I almost didn't come.

1:28:01.402 --> 1:28:02.945
- Why?
- You abandoned me

1:28:03.112 --> 1:28:05.906
with that horrible man at the morgue.

1:28:06.073 --> 1:28:08.325
I was half-naked.
I had to run.

1:28:09.368 --> 1:28:12.121
- Did he catch you?
- No. I'm way too fast.

1:28:12.288 --> 1:28:13.497
So?

1:28:13.664 --> 1:28:15.874
So nothing!
He could have caught me.

1:28:16.041 --> 1:28:17.710
I'm sorry.

1:28:18.794 --> 1:28:20.713
I regret going.

1:28:20.879 --> 1:28:22.298
I forgive you.

1:28:22.464 --> 1:28:25.884
Seeing you run without the wig
in a bra was funny.

1:28:26.051 --> 1:28:27.469
There's something else.

1:28:27.636 --> 1:28:29.513
What now?

1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:32.641
I wasn't able
to dance on David's grave.

1:28:32.808 --> 1:28:34.810
Well, it doesn't matter.

1:28:34.977 --> 1:28:38.897
Yes it does.
I had another fit, Kate.

1:28:39.064 --> 1:28:41.191
- I dug into his grave.
- What?

1:28:41.358 --> 1:28:43.902
- You're crazy!
- I know.

1:28:44.069 --> 1:28:46.989
I don't know why.
It was worse than the morgue.

1:28:47.156 --> 1:28:49.283
- I was trying to hit him.
- Hit him?

1:28:49.450 --> 1:28:50.951
And reach him.

1:28:51.118 --> 1:28:53.787
I was angry,
and also really sad.

1:28:53.954 --> 1:28:56.081
Everything mixed together.

1:28:56.248 --> 1:28:58.751
- Do you understand?
- No.

1:28:58.917 --> 1:29:01.045
And yes.

1:29:01.211 --> 1:29:02.671
I don't know.

1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:08.427
Maybe you feel guilty about his death.

1:29:11.555 --> 1:29:14.600
Mrs. Grey will wonder where I am.

1:29:14.767 --> 1:29:15.976
Wait, Kate.

1:29:16.143 --> 1:29:18.937
I need to talk, you do me good.
Please.

1:29:25.778 --> 1:29:27.196
You know,

1:29:27.363 --> 1:29:29.990
when you tell a friend the truth,

1:29:30.157 --> 1:29:32.284
he resents you for life.

1:29:32.451 --> 1:29:34.036
Try me.

1:29:34.203 --> 1:29:36.497
You really want to know what I think?

1:29:36.663 --> 1:29:37.456
Yes.

1:29:39.708 --> 1:29:42.836
I think from the start
it wasn't David you loved.

1:29:43.003 --> 1:29:45.589
It was your idea of David.

1:29:47.508 --> 1:29:50.427
The truth is
you loved a face and a body,

1:29:50.594 --> 1:29:53.597
into which you put
the person you wanted.

1:29:53.764 --> 1:29:55.682
The friend of your dreams.

1:29:55.849 --> 1:29:57.643
So he didn't really exist?

1:29:57.810 --> 1:29:59.561
Maybe not.

1:29:59.728 --> 1:30:01.522
Nonsense, David existed.

1:30:01.688 --> 1:30:04.316
I was with him,
I slept with him.

1:30:04.483 --> 1:30:06.235
So did you.

1:30:06.402 --> 1:30:08.320
Yes, someone existed.

1:30:08.487 --> 1:30:10.364
But not the person we thought.

1:30:11.990 --> 1:30:14.618
So we invent the people we love?

1:30:14.785 --> 1:30:15.911
That's dumb.

1:30:18.455 --> 1:30:19.873
I have to go.

1:30:21.333 --> 1:30:22.376
You know,

1:30:22.543 --> 1:30:25.170
you asked me
to tell you what I thought.

1:30:25.337 --> 1:30:26.755
No problem.

1:30:31.009 --> 1:30:33.429
Thanks for helping me
with the morgue.

1:30:33.595 --> 1:30:34.513
Really.

1:30:38.642 --> 1:30:40.269
I don't understand.

1:33:36.987 --> 1:33:37.904
Get him!

1:33:39.197 --> 1:33:40.741
Come on.

1:33:40.907 --> 1:33:41.825
Calm down.

1:33:43.285 --> 1:33:44.703
- Come on.
- Let me go!

1:33:46.788 --> 1:33:47.914
Let me go.

1:33:51.126 --> 1:33:53.962
<i>That's how,
on September 2nd, 1985,</i>

1:33:54.129 --> 1:33:57.549
<i>two cops arrested
an unstable boy of sixteen.</i>

1:34:00.344 --> 1:34:01.970
<i>I didn't even care.</i>

1:34:03.305 --> 1:34:05.182
<i>I'd kept my promise.</i>

1:34:10.187 --> 1:34:12.648
Mr. Alexis Robin, please.

1:34:12.814 --> 1:34:16.735
You're here today
for damaging the grave of your friend,

1:34:16.902 --> 1:34:20.781
Mr. David Gorman,
who died in a motorcycle accident

1:34:20.947 --> 1:34:25.577
after you two fought over a girl
you were both courting.

1:34:25.744 --> 1:34:30.499
You explained and justified
your behavior

1:34:30.666 --> 1:34:33.377
by evoking an oath
you made with the deceased.

1:34:33.543 --> 1:34:37.839
But desecrating a grave,
Mr. Robin, is a crime

1:34:38.006 --> 1:34:40.008
punishable by law.

1:34:40.175 --> 1:34:42.761
The court hereby sentences you

1:34:42.928 --> 1:34:47.683
to 140 hours of community service,

1:34:47.849 --> 1:34:52.062
and strongly recommends
psychological treatment.

1:34:52.229 --> 1:34:54.481
- Understood?
- Yes, your Honor.

1:34:54.648 --> 1:34:55.732
The hearing is adjourned.

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:05.594
Hey!

1:36:06.887 --> 1:36:08.138
Hi.

1:36:08.305 --> 1:36:10.640
- Do I know you?
- Don't think so.

1:36:10.807 --> 1:36:12.350
I recognize you.

1:36:12.517 --> 1:36:15.729
A friend and I dragged you to the beach.
You were drunk.

1:36:16.772 --> 1:36:17.898
Maybe...

1:36:18.064 --> 1:36:20.817
My friend David looked after you.

1:36:22.319 --> 1:36:24.321
Did you cut your hair?

1:36:24.488 --> 1:36:27.157
Yeah. I was sick of it.

1:36:27.324 --> 1:36:29.451
My girlfriend liked it,
but she dumped me.

1:36:29.618 --> 1:36:30.619
Shit.

1:36:30.786 --> 1:36:31.578
It's over now.

1:36:33.288 --> 1:36:34.122
Work here?

1:36:34.289 --> 1:36:36.750
For six months, after school.

1:36:36.917 --> 1:36:38.043
You?

1:36:38.210 --> 1:36:39.252
I start in a week.

1:36:39.419 --> 1:36:42.964
Helping the old man repair boats
in the harbor.

1:36:43.131 --> 1:36:44.090
Cool.

1:36:52.224 --> 1:36:53.558
What are you up to?

1:36:53.725 --> 1:36:55.101
Nothing special.

1:36:55.268 --> 1:36:56.686
Having a smoke.

1:36:56.853 --> 1:36:58.897
Want to take a boat ride?

1:36:59.064 --> 1:37:01.274
I know a sweet boat, the Calypso.

1:37:01.441 --> 1:37:02.442
Why not.

1:37:02.609 --> 1:37:03.485
Is it yours?

1:37:04.653 --> 1:37:06.279
It is now.

1:37:06.446 --> 1:37:08.406
Needs some repairs.

1:37:08.573 --> 1:37:09.616
I'm your man.

1:37:13.703 --> 1:37:14.704
Let's go.

1:37:17.833 --> 1:37:20.418
It's an orange dinghy in the harbor...

1:37:26.967 --> 1:37:29.177
<i>Please don't think my story ends here.</i>

1:37:30.053 --> 1:37:32.097
<i>I don't know the ending myself.</i>

1:37:33.306 --> 1:37:35.308
<i>Maybe this is just the beginning.</i>

1:37:37.227 --> 1:37:40.272
<i>I told you about
my summer of '85 with David,</i>

1:37:40.438 --> 1:37:42.190
<i>the friend of my dreams,</i>

1:37:42.357 --> 1:37:45.235
<i>so you'd understand
how I became what I am.</i>

1:37:46.361 --> 1:37:48.864
<i>Or perhaps what I no longer am.</i>

1:37:49.030 --> 1:37:51.116
<i>For the only thing that matters</i>

1:37:51.283 --> 1:37:53.910
<i>is to somehow manage</i>

1:37:54.077 --> 1:37:55.620
<i>to escape your history.</i>
