WEBVTT

01:45.564 --> 01:49.568
But if this is the last time

01:51.111 --> 01:54.656
Make up your mind

01:55.949 --> 01:58.410
I've waited a lifetime to live

01:58.493 --> 02:01.205
Camera 3, give me Lizzy. Taking camera 3.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.333
Donny, I need a wide.
Get a wide camera. Wide shot.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.294
I'm making a fire

02:11.089 --> 02:14.760
-Where should I put the coffee?
-Wait, where is Brett? Coff-- What?

02:14.843 --> 02:16.595
Chip said I should ask you
where to put it.

02:16.678 --> 02:21.183
I know a place we can start

02:23.143 --> 02:28.440
But if this is the last time

02:28.524 --> 02:30.859
Make up your mind

02:30.943 --> 02:34.947
Congratulations on everything, Stella.
Getting Alex back was masterful.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.031
I've waited a lifetime to live

02:36.114 --> 02:38.700
-Ratings last night…
-Yes, hell of an interview.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.952
Thanks so much, Gerald.

02:40.035 --> 02:43.997
It's time to ignite
I'm making a fire

02:56.426 --> 02:59.263
-What-- Go up there? Oh, Jesus. God.
-Go up and talk to Dave.

02:59.888 --> 03:04.393
Oh, my gosh, you guys.
The Foo Fighters. You guys… What?

03:04.476 --> 03:06.061
I love you, Dave!

03:06.144 --> 03:08.188
-I know every single song.
-It's a new song.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.024
Nobody's really heard it yet.
Comes out summer 2020.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.402
It was my daughter Violet's idea
to play it, actually.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.196
Yeah. I said, you know,
Alex should get a world premiere.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.156
-I love her. She's my favorite.
-She's cool.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.450
I mean, I love you guys, too, but…

03:20.534 --> 03:23.704
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
the Foo Fighters. That was amazing.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.624
We're out. Back in two minutes.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.877
-You doing okay?
-Dave, I'm so good.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.420
-Are you happy?
-Yeah.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.337
-Yeah?
-I'm happy.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.339
-You seem happy.
-Thank you for doing this.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.008
-You guys are the best.
-Thank you.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.801
The number two trending story is

03:37.885 --> 03:40.596
the president announcing
his budget proposal today,

03:40.679 --> 03:44.308
which is expected to include
steep cuts to Medicare and Medicaid

03:44.391 --> 03:46.727
and increase spending on a border wall.

03:46.810 --> 03:50.606
But the top trending topic
this morning is…

03:51.231 --> 03:52.232
It's Alex Levy.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.652
-It's Alex Levy.
-Come on. Wow!

03:55.736 --> 03:57.613
-Oh, my gosh.
-I've arrived, guys.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.448
-Yes, you can quit now.
-No, no.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.867
-No, don't-- don't quit.
-Wait.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.578
-She just got back.
-The people are saying,

04:04.661 --> 04:07.706
"Thank goodness Alex Levy's home.
Coffee doesn't taste right without her."

04:07.789 --> 04:10.876
-True. It did taste different today.
-That's very sweet.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.587
"OMG! So great to see Alex
and Bradley together.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.255
Bradley without Alex is
like Rose without Jack."

04:16.339 --> 04:18.257
-Adorable.
-Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.053
-Yeah.
-Twitter user @Crvcrab says,

04:21.136 --> 04:22.471
"Alex Levy, modern day hero."

04:22.554 --> 04:24.223
Yeah. "Hashtag feminist god."

04:24.932 --> 04:25.933
Okay, that's enough.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.101
I think we've heard enough of this.
Come on, Ty.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.521
Just keep hitting her
with those brutal tweets.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.774
We're thrilled to have you back.
You're family here on The Morning Show.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.903
Yanko, just a heads-up.
Someone reposted your Groundhog Day thing.

04:37.986 --> 04:38.987
That's cool.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.366
Yeah, actually,
it's what I said the other day.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.452
They don't like that you call
something your spirit animal,

04:45.536 --> 04:47.037
so that's why they reposted it.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.956
-Oh, please. Is it-- Is that it?
-Yeah.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.040
Let me see that.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.053
Crap. Thanks.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.680
It's okay.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.891
Brava!
That's what I call a show, girlfriend.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.853
-L-E-V-Y, what does it spell?
-I love you.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.814
-Congrats. I'll see you upstairs.
-Thanks, honey.

05:13.897 --> 05:17.401
-Alex, great to have you back.
-Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.488
-Hey, good show.
-Thank-- Thanks.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.702
-I think it went well.
-I gave Stella your best political stuff.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.997
So hopefully this will get us moderator.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.665
Yeah, I hope so too.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.835
People still stop me on the street
about that de Blasio interview.

05:34.918 --> 05:39.464
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yeah. I have a meeting.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.759
-You have a meeting?
-I booked it myself.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.553
I'll call you in a couple hours.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.766
-We did it.
-You've done it, like, a million times.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.311
I know.
But, like, a million lifetimes ago.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.439
Could you imagine if they paid me
all that money and I just sucked?

05:55.522 --> 05:58.817
-Well, you didn't have to come back.
-I know, but I did.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.403
Is it good?

06:01.486 --> 06:06.325
Oh, gosh. Oh, man.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.409
-Mom?
-Yeah?

06:07.492 --> 06:11.079
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.415
Lizzy, you wanna go check out
the spread in the kitchen?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.501
-See if your mom wants some food?
-Yeah.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.964
Okay. Okay.

06:22.007 --> 06:26.053
-Okay. Sorry.
-Last night's interview played great.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.305
I mean, yes, you were nervous.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.432
But it turned out great.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.142
-The ratings were great.
-Yeah.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.353
First show back, smashing success.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.731
-Relax.
-I hear you.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.526
Okay. I know, right? I need to relax.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.611
Good.
Now, we do need to talk about the debate.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.364
The DNC needs their list of moderators,
and it's just--

06:45.447 --> 06:47.991
We gotta book the travel
and hotels, Vegas, all that stuff.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.994
Yeah. Yeah. No. No.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.997
The last thing I want right now
is more exposure.

06:54.081 --> 06:57.209
Is there a part of you that feels
you should do it? As a show of good faith.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.585
No.

06:58.669 --> 07:01.922
You mentioned what a generous deal
they made for you,

07:02.005 --> 07:04.341
and they obviously didn't do that
for nothing.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.844
They know you can bring home the bacon
and fry it up.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.720
You'll bring 'em a huge audience.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.305
It's win-win.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.807
I have to take it. It's Doug.

07:11.890 --> 07:12.975
Alex…

07:14.977 --> 07:15.978
you should do this.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.189
-Should do this?
-Yeah.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.607
You know what you should do?

07:21.692 --> 07:24.820
Yeah. Right. Okay. Still-- Still doing it.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.657
And you know that comes
with all the love in my heart.

07:29.241 --> 07:33.579
Hey, Doug. Yes, I did.
I got all of your flowers.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.128
Okay, now, when you're doing
your interview, remember,

07:41.211 --> 07:44.131
law professors do not need to be ambushed.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.176
This is to establish
how Italian law sometimes has a--

07:47.259 --> 07:48.260
Yeah, yeah.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.889
By "yeah, yeah, yeah,"
do you just want me to shut up?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.641
-She wants me to shut up.
-I'm just trying to focus right now.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.226
Okay. I get it.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.061
I get it. I totally get it.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.273
We could rehearse.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.817
I could play the professor.

08:03.901 --> 08:07.946
You could play Paola Lambruschini,
documentary filmmaker.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.743
Actually, Fido could play the professor.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.286
-He's very professional.
-Yeah.

08:14.369 --> 08:19.583
He's got one of those jackets with patches
on the elbows, the whole thing.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.293
Yeah? Wanna do that?

08:25.339 --> 08:26.673
You're gonna do great.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.558
I know it's early in the day
for the Donner Party,

08:37.643 --> 08:40.312
but Plus sent over a cut
of the Forlorn Hope finale.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.688
-You want to watch it now?
-Oh, yes. God, yes.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.069
You know…

08:48.695 --> 08:51.865
for someone in the closet,
you sure know your way around.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.993
I'm not in the closet.
I'm just not actually a lesbian.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.580
Well, you're something.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.332
You're something.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.838
-I better go.
-You have to?

09:05.921 --> 09:08.841
Yeah, I gotta go to Cory's office.

09:08.924 --> 09:11.093
I'm gonna walk in there,
and I'm gonna tell him

09:11.176 --> 09:13.762
that I'm not fucking leaving
until he gives me moderator.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.516
-What?
-So sorry. I didn't mean to laugh.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.810
It just sounded funny, so combative.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.687
It's not combative. It's honest.

09:21.770 --> 09:25.899
Is that how you two communicate,
with unvarnished truths and ultimatums?

09:25.983 --> 09:28.485
I can tell you,
I've known Cory a long time,

09:28.569 --> 09:30.696
and he wouldn't let just anyone do that.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.573
-It's complicated.
-I'd like to hear.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.201
I guess…

09:37.619 --> 09:41.540
Okay, well,
on the day of Alex's last show--

09:42.082 --> 09:44.293
Actually, it feels gross calling it that.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.713
On the day Hannah died.
Did you know Hannah?

09:47.796 --> 09:51.592
-No, but I know who you mean.
-Well, so much happened that day.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.761
And after it all,
the board actually fired Cory.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.182
-Please don't tell anybody I said that.
-I won't.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.641
I mean, they never announced it.

09:59.725 --> 10:03.520
They fired Cory, they put Fred on leave,
and they suspended me.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.022
Alex took off.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.609
So Cory and I got really close.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.236
We really showed up for each other and…

10:12.654 --> 10:15.449
-Are you sure you want to hear this?
-Where's it going exactly?

10:16.033 --> 10:20.454
As friends, I was just…
My heart broke for him.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.957
-He was really vulnerable.
-Yeah, he doesn't lead with that.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.876
No, but-- But then a couple days later,

10:25.959 --> 10:30.047
I got up in front of the board,
and I just fucking unloaded on them.

10:30.130 --> 10:34.343
And I told them that Fred had to be fired,
and that Cory was the guy to replace him,

10:34.426 --> 10:37.346
and I really didn't think
I was getting through to them.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.307
But then a day later,
he came down to my room,

10:40.390 --> 10:42.726
and he said that they made him CEO.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.437
And as his first act,
he was lifting my suspension.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.691
At that point,
he and I were, like, best friends.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.569
And I was a really good friend to him.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.490
Anyway, fuck him.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.497
You know they're talking about
replacing him, right?

11:03.580 --> 11:04.873
Wait, what?

11:04.957 --> 11:06.458
UBA is in third,

11:06.542 --> 11:10.420
which wouldn't be such a big deal
if it didn't go hand in hand with scandal.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.340
I mean, it doesn't matter
that he's had success for them.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.675
People's memories are short,

11:14.758 --> 11:17.261
and at the end of the day,
it just comes down to money.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.848
And he's investing
just massive amounts in UBA+,

11:20.931 --> 11:23.809
which doesn't launch for another month,
and it needs to perform.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.980
And, I mean, another streaming service?

11:28.063 --> 11:30.524
-They should be illegal.
-I guess you could just not subscribe.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.608
At this point,

11:31.692 --> 11:37.406
UBA's balance sheet basically looks like
a hemophiliac's used Band-Aid.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.491
You should talk to him.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.287
That's what I'm gonna do.
That's how this conversation started.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.206
But you should reconcile with him,
even if it's just for show.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.083
The network is your partner.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.544
And he's your CEO for now.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.255
Make them your ally, not your foe.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.008
Your career will thank you.

12:12.357 --> 12:15.360
-Wow, you got a lot of stuff.
-I'm used to it.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.240
-What will you do while I'm in it?
-What am I going to do?

12:20.324 --> 12:23.285
-Practice my singing…
-Uh-huh.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.578
…with some Italian music.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.496
Ready?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.540
Uno, duo, tre, quatro!

12:28.624 --> 12:32.461
When I was a boy
Just about the eighth-a grade

12:32.544 --> 12:34.087
Mama used to say

12:34.171 --> 12:38.592
"Don't stay out-a late
With the bad-a boys

12:38.675 --> 12:41.512
Always shootin' pool, Giuseppe
You gonna flunk-a school!"

12:42.721 --> 12:43.805
Idiota.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.390
You talking to Giuseppe?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.519
You know, Giuseppe…

12:52.397 --> 12:54.399
I'm not really used to people helping me.

12:55.817 --> 12:56.818
So…

12:58.445 --> 12:59.780
So thank you.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.575
Prego.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.578
What's-a matter you?

13:06.662 --> 13:08.205
Hey! Gotta no respect?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.289
Stop it.

13:09.373 --> 13:13.377
What-a you think you do?
Why you look-a so sad?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.630
It's-a not so bad
It's-a nice-a place

13:16.713 --> 13:19.174
-Keep it down!
-Ah, shaddap-a you face!

13:29.142 --> 13:30.811
Hey, Paige, is everything okay?

13:30.894 --> 13:35.274
No, everything is not okay.
Kelly Daykin just called me.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.109
I didn't know you two talked.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.652
It wasn't a good call.

13:38.735 --> 13:43.365
Someone tried to plant a nasty story
in the Daily News about Hannah Shoenfeld.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.577
Did she say what it was?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.245
She spared me details.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.622
Apparently it paints her
as pretty fucked up.

13:50.706 --> 13:52.708
You said, "tried." "Tried to plant."

13:52.791 --> 13:55.085
-So, they're not printing it?
-They're not.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.212
Why did she call you?

13:57.296 --> 13:59.047
I think the implication is clear.

13:59.131 --> 14:02.009
Oh, my God, Paige,
you don't think I'm behind this?

14:02.092 --> 14:04.720
-Who do you think I am?
-The kids don't need this.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.305
It was not me.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.640
That poor girl doesn't need this.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.268
-Paige.
-I don't wanna hear it.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.646
I did my duty.
I hope you're enjoying Italy.

14:26.742 --> 14:29.578
When he arrived, he was starving.

14:29.661 --> 14:32.122
I'd seen that look so many times
these last five months.

14:32.206 --> 14:33.248
It was horrible.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.375
So where is he, Mr. Keseberg?

14:35.459 --> 14:38.128
Where is my son?
We will dig up every last inch of dirt…

14:38.212 --> 14:40.047
Kyle, who's calling on my direct?

14:40.130 --> 14:42.799
-Please, Mr. Eddy.
-If I have--

14:43.592 --> 14:44.801
Kyle, who is it?

14:46.220 --> 14:48.514
I didn't know if I should yell this out.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.516
It's Mitch Kessler.

14:53.227 --> 14:57.523
Okay, I'll take it. Stay off this one.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.871
-Hello?
-Yeah?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.249
I didn't know you were there.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.210
Most people say, "Hello."

15:18.293 --> 15:19.837
Something new I'm trying out.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.588
Groundbreaking stuff.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.260
I'm calling
because I thought you should know

15:26.343 --> 15:30.848
that someone has launched
a smear campaign against Hannah.

15:32.891 --> 15:33.892
Fred.

15:33.976 --> 15:37.646
Yeah. Daily News isn't gonna run it,

15:37.729 --> 15:41.692
but his tentacles run so deep
that somebody's gonna bite eventually.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.151
Unless you cut it off at the root.

15:43.235 --> 15:46.488
Yeah? What you expect me to do, Mitch?
Kill and eat him to keep him quiet?

15:46.572 --> 15:49.449
What do I expect you to do?
The right thing.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.620
Can you say that again?
It's amazing coming out of your mouth.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.414
Look, I'm just trying to help.

15:55.497 --> 15:58.292
You know, I don't have
the UBA apparatus at my disposal.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.335
And my money is not good
in that town anymore.

16:00.961 --> 16:04.006
Why don't you take a big step back
and think about this?

16:04.089 --> 16:06.008
This is your fault.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.135
You can try and pretend
like Fred's the bad guy,

16:08.218 --> 16:10.470
but there are no nasty stories
without you, pal.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.557
Well, you made
some pretty big fucking promises.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.352
Yeah? Fred, so bad he had to go.

16:17.436 --> 16:20.981
Or maybe you just wanted his job.
Well, congratulations.

16:21.064 --> 16:26.945
I'm glad that it is so easy for you to sit
in that big room full of straw,

16:27.029 --> 16:30.782
judging me, when you should be doing
what you promised and spin it into gold.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.203
You're the CEO.
Do what a CEO does: handle it.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.121
Handle the suit. Make it go away.

16:36.205 --> 16:38.582
Keep these awful stories out of the press

16:38.665 --> 16:42.419
and leave me the fuck alone
so I can live my life.

16:42.503 --> 16:44.505
Whatever miserable scraps are left of it.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.267
Hey, I need a second.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.352
Can it wait?

16:58.852 --> 17:02.064
It has waited two weeks
in quarantine in China and then some.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.483
What's another couple of hours?
I have to get to Stella's.

17:04.566 --> 17:07.277
But that's why it can't wait.
Sooner you agree, sooner you're upstairs.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.695
Two minutes.

17:16.453 --> 17:19.080
Don't worry.
You're not the topic of conversation.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.832
And why the fuck not?

17:20.915 --> 17:23.794
I want to be the topic of conversation
for once.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.088
I did a lot of thinking
trapped in that little box.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.966
Oh, my God, Daniel.
Beijing Hilton is not a little box.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.801
-We've talked--
-I'm not talking about the Hilton.

17:30.884 --> 17:31.885
I'm talking about my life.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.680
I don't have a 50-minute hour.
I have two minutes.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.932
I'll make it quick
because I didn't come here for therapy.

17:37.766 --> 17:38.892
Look.

17:38.976 --> 17:43.564
There is a pattern of behavior
around here that, to put it kindly,

17:43.647 --> 17:46.483
often excuses the bad behavior
of white folks

17:46.567 --> 17:49.528
and disadvantages the people of color,
namely me.

17:49.611 --> 17:50.612
And you know it too.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.907
I mean, at least George Wallace had
the courtesy to tell you to your face.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.201
I'm done turning the other cheek.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.369
Okay, okay.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.205
Of course I know it.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.709
Sure it's not lost on you
that I was only put in charge

18:03.792 --> 18:06.211
after everything had gone to shit
and failure was damn near certain.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.296
So I get it.

18:07.379 --> 18:11.216
But look, I am-- I'm…
happier to have the job in this situation

18:11.300 --> 18:13.594
than to be shut out
in the name of fairness.

18:13.677 --> 18:17.181
And all I ask is that,
when you talk to Stella,

18:17.264 --> 18:19.099
you push for me to moderate.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.686
Okay. You're right.
I will plead your case.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.022
Now I have to get up there.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.317
There should be some Black voice up there.

18:28.901 --> 18:31.195
And it's not gonna come
from one of the candidates.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.821
I'll do what I can.

18:37.743 --> 18:42.414
-You're not gonna fire me over this?
-Oh, no. Come on, Yanko, no. But…

18:44.666 --> 18:47.044
You know,
the backlash has gotten out of hand.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.380
It's just one of those things.
We know you didn't mean anything by it.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.758
But we gotta nip
that thing in the bud, okay?

18:53.509 --> 18:56.094
So, you're gonna have to apologize
on the show tomorrow.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.431
So you want me to say I'm sorry.

18:59.515 --> 19:02.643
-Yeah. You gotta be.
-Okay, I still don't-- I don't understand

19:02.726 --> 19:05.854
why it's a bad thing for me
to call something my spirit animal, okay?

19:05.938 --> 19:08.357
And by the way,
a whole week went by, nobody cared.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.485
Well, they care now, and we care.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.029
How am I supposed to feel sorry
for something that doesn't make sense?

19:14.112 --> 19:16.490
-I mean, it's not like I did a rain dance.
-Oh, my God.

19:16.573 --> 19:19.785
You know what? It's--
It's appropriation.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.078
You're not Native American.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.706
It's like if someone who wasn't Cuban
was appropriating Cuban things.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.209
That doesn't bother me. I don't care.
Look, for the record,

19:27.292 --> 19:30.128
I have no problem apologizing
when I believe I've done something wrong,

19:30.212 --> 19:33.382
but you honestly want me to apologize
for something if I don't even mean it?

19:33.465 --> 19:35.175
In a perfect world,

19:35.259 --> 19:40.639
you understand that what you did is wrong,
you learn from it, and you apologize.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.474
Okay?

19:45.060 --> 19:46.061
It's fine.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.526
All right, fine. I'll do it. You know, I--

19:52.609 --> 19:54.486
-I don't push back like this, you know.
-No, I know. I know.

19:54.570 --> 19:58.490
Okay, and I'm sorry to be so combative,
but it hurts to be this misunderstood.

19:58.574 --> 20:00.826
Thanks for-- Thanks for coming in.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.579
I don't even think the guy
who tweeted it was Native American.

20:03.662 --> 20:05.539
Okay. I'll see you downstairs.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.627
-Oh, God.
-He means well.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.966
Look, can I bend your ear
about something else?

20:16.049 --> 20:17.509
Bend away.

20:18.552 --> 20:22.306
What do you think
about Daniel moderating the debate?

20:22.389 --> 20:24.516
Everyone and their mother's
been lobbying for this,

20:24.600 --> 20:26.185
like I have some sort of choice to make.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.936
We have to use Eric, obviously,

20:28.020 --> 20:30.647
and Cory's made it clear
that he wants it to be Alex.

20:31.190 --> 20:32.733
It should be Noorean, by the way.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.277
Best ratings on UBANC, warm and wonky.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.988
But there can't be an equal number
of candidates and moderators.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.823
I'm sorry.
There just isn't room for Daniel.

20:39.907 --> 20:44.161
Daniel feels minimized on a grand scale,
you know, relegated to the breezy stuff.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.621
-And it--
-It's The Twist.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.331
The breeze makes it twist.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.209
Right, but it's not just the breezy stuff.

20:50.292 --> 20:54.379
Daniel feels like he's only asked
to report on diverse stories,

20:54.463 --> 20:58.759
which, if we're being honest,
don't get as much airtime.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.802
He thinks this is a racial thing?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.180
-A homophobic thing.
-You know what?

21:03.263 --> 21:06.391
I'm not gonna put words in his mouth,
but I'll give you my opinion.

21:06.475 --> 21:07.476
Okay.

21:07.559 --> 21:11.980
Daniel Henderson can moderate this debate
as well as anybody we have,

21:12.064 --> 21:14.525
and he's got
a really important perspective.

21:15.943 --> 21:19.321
Not everyone can be John or Paul.
Some people have to be Ringo.

21:21.156 --> 21:22.324
There's no shame in that.

21:22.407 --> 21:26.870
In my opinion, Daniel's reached the level
of his charisma,

21:26.954 --> 21:29.581
which, to be clear,
is hosting the nine o'clock hour

21:29.665 --> 21:31.708
on a major television network.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.253
It's not exactly an insult.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.420
He's really good.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.882
Everybody who's made it to this level
was the star somewhere else,

21:38.966 --> 21:42.719
but in a universe full of stars,
I don't think he has the "it" factor.

21:45.556 --> 21:48.976
What's most important is that
it's unique to you.

21:49.059 --> 21:50.310
To who you are.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.395
TV's, like, 90 years old.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.231
The only thing you or anyone can do
that hasn't been done before

21:54.314 --> 21:56.525
-is offer their perspective.
-I agree.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.236
I think people want to know who you are.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.029
Hey, great show today.

22:01.530 --> 22:04.116
-Thank you.
-Yes. Hell of a start, huh?

22:04.199 --> 22:05.617
Yeah, amazing.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.287
-Listen…
-Yes?

22:08.370 --> 22:09.538
About this debate…

22:09.621 --> 22:11.582
I hear you don't want to do it.

22:11.665 --> 22:14.877
But can I just tell you
why we think it's so important?

22:15.794 --> 22:16.837
You-- Yes.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.589
It's not about drawing viewers,

22:18.672 --> 22:21.717
because all eyes will already be
on UBA that night,

22:21.800 --> 22:23.552
but with all of our recent troubles,

22:23.635 --> 22:27.431
it's imperative to show that we can
still deliver good quality content.

22:28.599 --> 22:33.770
And nothing says quality more than you,
Alex, and you'll kill it.

22:33.854 --> 22:36.148
And you'll get a ton of juice off of it.

22:37.691 --> 22:38.817
You think I need juice?

22:38.901 --> 22:41.528
I'm not particularly saying
you need juice,

22:41.612 --> 22:43.739
but, you know,
who doesn't need some juice?

22:45.824 --> 22:48.535
I think there are other people here
with a lot more to prove.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.872
-We very much appreciate the ask.
-Yeah, but no.

22:51.955 --> 22:52.956
Okay.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.250
I hear you.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.505
But just think about it, for me.
That's all I ask.

23:01.507 --> 23:03.634
Gonna let you guys get back to it.

23:10.682 --> 23:11.767
Wow.

23:12.434 --> 23:16.355
I mean, who is that punk that
second-guesses every single thing I say?

23:17.940 --> 23:21.318
-God.
-Well, she's the president of UBA News.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.861
Cory clearly thinks a lot of her,

23:22.945 --> 23:26.740
because he paid a lot for DADA Media
to absorb it and her into the network--

23:26.823 --> 23:28.116
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.327
I mean, seriously,
where the fuck does she get off?

23:30.410 --> 23:32.788
I'm supposed to listen to her?
I have sweaters older than her.

23:32.871 --> 23:34.706
Well, age and maturity aren't
the same thing.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.166
Chip, that's not what I'm saying.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.752
She just hasn't--
She hasn't gone through enough shit.

23:38.836 --> 23:40.420
You know, she hasn't had enough pain

23:40.504 --> 23:43.257
to be bossing all of us around
who have been through it.

23:43.340 --> 23:44.842
You know, she just-- I don't know.

23:44.925 --> 23:48.220
She's got this attitude about her
like she's this arbiter of morality.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.514
Okay, I think
you might be rushing to judgment.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.767
She thought bringing you back here
was a crazy idea, which is bullshit.

23:55.727 --> 23:58.438
-She thinks I shouldn't be here?
-No, you should be here.

23:58.522 --> 24:01.567
You're missing the point.
She just doesn't get it.

24:01.650 --> 24:03.026
Who else thinks that?

24:04.027 --> 24:05.529
Nobody. Okay, never mind.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.824
Chip, just forget that I said it.
Please don't give it another thought.

24:09.408 --> 24:13.120
I was just trying to make a point
you weren't hearing fast enough.

24:16.081 --> 24:17.374
It looks good.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.418
He looks very credible.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.462
Okay, I will translate.

24:24.631 --> 24:30.470
Okay, so, here he's saying
that the criminal justice system in Italy

24:30.554 --> 24:33.807
was not written with women in mind.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.351
Of course. So, I ask him

24:36.435 --> 24:39.521
if there were any noteworthy examples

24:39.605 --> 24:42.149
of men and women
being treated differently.

24:42.232 --> 24:45.360
And he says, yes, of course,
there are many examples.

24:45.444 --> 24:46.445
And so…

24:47.487 --> 24:49.573
I'm bringing up Amanda Knox.

24:52.075 --> 24:55.120
And that just got him talking
and talking and talking.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.789
And, you know,
there is a lot of good stuff here.

24:58.457 --> 25:00.000
Yeah, that was really smart.

25:01.168 --> 25:04.463
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was.

25:05.923 --> 25:10.302
Okay, keep watching,
and the food will be ready soon.

25:12.763 --> 25:14.765
Here are the noodles.

25:16.016 --> 25:18.519
Here's the sauce. Enjoy.

25:19.061 --> 25:21.146
That's it? Really?

25:21.230 --> 25:23.106
-Well…
-That's where the service stops.

25:23.190 --> 25:26.818
Wow, you're two inches
from the finish line,

25:26.902 --> 25:28.320
and you're not gonna serve me.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.572
-Well, I made the food.
-Okay.

25:30.656 --> 25:31.907
That's as grateful as I get.

25:31.990 --> 25:36.078
Well, I am never coming back
to this establishment.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.705
The service is terrible.

25:38.789 --> 25:42.084
And you took--
Look at how much you took.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.211
-You left very little.
-Come here.

25:44.294 --> 25:45.712
-Don't do that.
-You're so--

25:49.466 --> 25:51.468
Here. The fork is in the drawer.

26:00.143 --> 26:05.148
Our campaign is thinking big
and not small.

26:05.232 --> 26:08.235
So we'll see you tomorrow.
Great job today. Thank you.

26:12.364 --> 26:13.490
Did you talk to Stella?

26:14.408 --> 26:17.202
I did. It's not in the cards this time.

26:19.246 --> 26:21.039
We've got the Phoenix debate next month.

26:21.123 --> 26:23.917
-If I were you, I would focus on--
-She said no? Did she say why?

26:24.001 --> 26:25.919
Okay, well…

26:27.546 --> 26:30.382
She loves you,
but the network is looking to showcase

26:30.465 --> 26:32.551
some other talents
at this particular moment.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.179
Okay, are they going
with a different Black journalist?

26:35.804 --> 26:37.306
A different gay journalist?

26:37.389 --> 26:39.141
-Hey. Good night.
-Good night.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.562
I actually don't think
it's what you're thinking.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.106
Okay. So then what is it, then?

26:46.190 --> 26:48.692
Stella doesn't think you have enough
of the "it" factor.

26:49.318 --> 26:52.654
-Enough of the "it" factor?
-I probably shouldn't be telling you this,

26:52.738 --> 26:57.910
but I think that Stella would prefer
you think that she's blind to your charms

26:57.993 --> 26:59.244
than she's a bigot.

26:59.328 --> 27:02.456
A person could be blind to my charms
because they are a bigot.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.124
How'd you respond?

27:06.418 --> 27:08.712
She knows I think she's being ridiculous.

27:11.465 --> 27:13.383
Listen, Earl, don't overcomplicate this.

27:14.343 --> 27:17.054
All I need you to do is find out
what stories Fred's trying to plant,

27:17.137 --> 27:19.932
where he's planting them, how he's
doing it, and if we can stop them.

27:20.015 --> 27:22.768
But nothing extrajudicial.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.978
Yeah, okay. I'll get back to you.

27:51.129 --> 27:52.130
Bradley.

27:52.214 --> 27:54.925
If it isn't the pride of West Virginia
and the 15th floor.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.093
I don't know who's moderating.

27:56.176 --> 27:58.428
I don't mean to sound full of myself,
but that's beneath me now.

27:58.512 --> 28:00.013
This isn't about that.

28:00.097 --> 28:01.932
-Can I come in?
-Yeah, sure.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.230
Can I get you a drink?

28:08.313 --> 28:10.482
No, I just wanna talk for a minute.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.401
Something wrong?

28:12.484 --> 28:13.485
No, no.

28:16.154 --> 28:17.322
Are you gonna sit down?

28:19.074 --> 28:20.117
Okay.

28:25.205 --> 28:31.086
Look, I know
that our friendship has suffered

28:31.170 --> 28:33.922
over the last little bit
with everything that's happened,

28:34.006 --> 28:37.593
and I-- I'm not okay with that.

28:38.427 --> 28:40.554
And I hope
that you're not okay with that either.

28:41.138 --> 28:43.307
No. No, I'm not.

28:43.390 --> 28:46.476
But, hey,
let's consider the slate wiped clean.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.606
-That's it?
-That's it. It was that simple.

28:51.106 --> 28:53.984
Well, I don't want you to say
that the slate is wiped clean

28:54.067 --> 28:55.485
if the slate is not wiped clean,

28:55.569 --> 28:58.113
because it sounds a little bit
like you're trying to shut me up.

28:58.197 --> 29:00.949
Bradley, I don't know
who's moderating the fucking debate.

29:01.033 --> 29:02.743
This is not about the debate, Cory.

29:02.826 --> 29:05.078
If you're not gonna treat me like the CEO
when you're furious at me,

29:05.162 --> 29:07.247
please don't treat me like a CEO
when you try to make up.

29:07.331 --> 29:10.751
Okay, fine.
I was pissed at you at New Year's Eve.

29:10.834 --> 29:13.420
And I've been a little bit aggressive
and abrasive towards you

29:13.504 --> 29:14.505
for the past six weeks.

29:14.588 --> 29:16.965
And I-- I wanna apologize.

29:17.049 --> 29:19.259
And just because I'm abrasive

29:19.343 --> 29:22.012
doesn't mean that I don't care about
our fucking friendship.

29:25.599 --> 29:28.685
All right, that wasn't any good.
I-- Let me just try that again.

29:29.895 --> 29:32.606
And don't look at me like that
when I'm trying to do this.

29:34.525 --> 29:37.152
I was not thrilled with you
for the past month and a half.

29:37.945 --> 29:42.491
But I have come to realize that
I haven't been entirely fair about it.

29:42.574 --> 29:43.784
Okay.

29:43.867 --> 29:48.121
And I know that you're the CEO
and that my needs aren't always…

29:49.122 --> 29:52.334
that you can't have a direct line
to all my needs and concerns,

29:52.417 --> 29:54.878
-'cause you're juggling a lot.
-I have been pretty good to you.

29:54.962 --> 29:57.881
But I did have a reason to be angry.
I hope that's not what you're saying.

29:57.965 --> 30:01.802
-I am not saying that. Absolutely.
-Can we just get the fuck over this, Cory?

30:01.885 --> 30:03.345
Honestly.

30:09.393 --> 30:12.145
Love is never being able to say
you're sorry.

30:12.229 --> 30:13.230
I'm sorry.

30:15.566 --> 30:16.900
I'm sorry.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.571
I really am sorry.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.699
Oh, fuck.

30:28.537 --> 30:33.250
This is it. This is just all part
of the Bradley Jackson ride, isn't it?

30:33.750 --> 30:35.460
You know I'm never gonna be your enemy.

30:35.544 --> 30:38.463
I'm never going to let that happen.
I only want what's best for you.

30:38.547 --> 30:41.800
And for some inscrutable reason,
you won't just trust that that's true.

30:41.884 --> 30:44.344
I'm not saying I didn't do anything wrong.
I did, and I'm sorry.

30:44.428 --> 30:46.889
But I needed you to understand
that I had my reasons.

30:46.972 --> 30:49.933
And if you have an issue
with me or with anybody in the future,

30:50.017 --> 30:53.270
if you could just try to see your way
to not assume the worst from me.

30:53.353 --> 30:56.857
To not channel whatever it is
that you're feeling through that

30:56.940 --> 30:59.735
beautiful little anger prism that lives
in your heart and makes you so exciting,

30:59.818 --> 31:02.029
and know that I am there
to help you solve,

31:02.112 --> 31:04.907
or at least help you get through
any problems.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.286
I'm on your side.

31:10.412 --> 31:11.413
Always.

31:15.751 --> 31:17.711
Besides, I'm too old to have enemies.

31:17.794 --> 31:21.340
It's weird when you're 51 years old
and you got enemies. So…

31:21.924 --> 31:23.967
Anger wasn't really what I was feeling.

31:25.219 --> 31:27.429
Anger is just what I know what to do with.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.056
But hurt…

31:32.017 --> 31:33.810
And you didn't even do anything,
specifically,

31:33.894 --> 31:35.604
it just hurt because it was you.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.335
As far as moderator goes--

31:58.418 --> 32:00.379
-Oh, gosh, don't--
-No, I love that you want it.

32:00.462 --> 32:02.756
But a lot of people want it,
and Alex just came back.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.384
She made a splashy return,
so that's probably gonna happen.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.803
And I don't see
using two straight white women.

32:10.097 --> 32:11.640
Thank you for telling me.

32:12.766 --> 32:16.353
And I really-- I really appreciate
everything you just said.

32:21.108 --> 32:22.484
Well, you know where I live.

32:27.322 --> 32:28.532
I do.

32:38.625 --> 32:39.960
-Did you call?
-No, I didn't.

32:40.043 --> 32:43.755
I was excited to tell you what happened.
And you said you weren't doing anything.

32:43.839 --> 32:46.967
Well, then it's a good thing
I was telling the truth.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.303
-Drink?
-No, I'm good.

32:50.012 --> 32:51.889
But I wanted to tell you
I took your advice,

32:51.972 --> 32:53.098
and it went really well.

32:54.183 --> 32:56.351
It did? You're getting the debate?

32:56.435 --> 33:00.063
No, but we made up.
Like, we actually made up.

33:00.731 --> 33:02.900
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah, it's good.

33:02.983 --> 33:05.194
And we didn't even really talk
about the debate.

33:05.277 --> 33:08.238
He-- You know,
he knew I was there to work him,

33:08.322 --> 33:10.699
but he didn't really
rake me over the coals about it.

33:10.782 --> 33:13.452
And he offered a little context,
but I didn't pursue it

33:13.535 --> 33:15.746
because I didn't want to ruin
everything with work.

33:15.829 --> 33:17.080
But I get it.

33:17.164 --> 33:21.627
There's a lot of factors at play,
you know, business stuff, optics stuff,

33:21.710 --> 33:25.255
and it make sense
that Alex is gonna do it.

33:25.339 --> 33:28.133
You know, you can't trot out
two straight white women,

33:28.217 --> 33:30.135
especially if Bloomberg is gonna be
up there.

33:30.219 --> 33:34.014
You're going to really need diversity
to ask about stop and frisk.

33:35.224 --> 33:37.309
Bradley,
you just called yourself straight.

33:38.644 --> 33:42.523
Yeah, that's because
to most of the world, I am.

33:43.649 --> 33:45.359
And why is that exactly?

33:46.151 --> 33:48.111
Because most of the time I'm straight.

33:49.404 --> 33:53.075
Isn't it sort of antiquated
to try and nail this thing down so firmly?

33:53.158 --> 33:56.119
Isn't sexually fluid a thing?

33:56.703 --> 33:58.247
Is that what you're saying you are?

33:59.039 --> 34:01.041
No, I'm not saying I'm anything.

34:01.124 --> 34:04.211
I don't define every single thing I do.
I'm a sexual person.

34:04.294 --> 34:08.005
I once had a three-way with two men.
Does that make me a--

34:08.090 --> 34:09.174
A slut?

34:11.635 --> 34:12.928
This is not funny.

34:13.011 --> 34:16.889
Well… it's not funny to me, either.

34:16.974 --> 34:18.641
Then why are you laughing?

34:18.725 --> 34:21.687
Because I am amazed that you have it
so easy and you make it so hard.

34:21.770 --> 34:23.272
I have it easy?

34:23.355 --> 34:25.649
What am I supposed to do,
go into Stella's office and say,

34:25.732 --> 34:29.695
"I'm a gay bisexual type.
I want the debate. Now."

34:29.777 --> 34:31.112
We're talking about a situation

34:31.196 --> 34:34.116
where you being different
can work to your advantage now.

34:34.908 --> 34:37.369
I kept my private life to myself
because I had to.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.998
It was 1997, and it was painful.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.708
And it sucked.

34:43.792 --> 34:48.045
But I slowly, quietly tried to live a life
that was more truthful.

34:48.130 --> 34:50.382
Not with the world,
but with my inner circle.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.634
But people talk.

34:52.717 --> 34:56.221
They're fascinated by who's gay
and who's not for some fucking reason.

34:56.304 --> 34:59.099
Next thing I know,
YDA is handing me my walking papers.

34:59.683 --> 35:01.602
-They fired you?
-Of course they did.

35:01.685 --> 35:05.689
Why would I have quit that job
at that point in my career?

35:06.773 --> 35:10.903
I mean, it wasn't explicit.
They didn't literally hand me a pink slip.

35:12.029 --> 35:16.366
But when you're not wanted,
people find a way of letting you know.

35:17.492 --> 35:19.244
And, I don't know,

35:19.328 --> 35:22.873
I have to tell you
there is something inside me

35:22.956 --> 35:26.919
that wants to resent you
for not being grateful for this.

35:27.878 --> 35:30.714
I see someone
who is walking the same path,

35:30.797 --> 35:34.259
honestly, a path I helped lay.

35:34.343 --> 35:39.431
And it's a little annoying,
and I'm envious. That's it.

35:40.974 --> 35:43.936
I lost a job for being gay.
You should embrace it.

35:44.770 --> 35:46.897
I mean, it's not like you would be lying.

35:48.106 --> 35:51.944
I'm just not interested
in using my identity like that.

35:52.027 --> 35:53.195
I'm just not.

35:53.278 --> 35:56.448
You're not interested
in it-- it being your identity.

35:57.533 --> 35:59.326
But you don't seem to mind…

35:59.826 --> 36:02.538
identifying yourself as a Southerner.

36:03.705 --> 36:04.957
What do you mean by that?

36:05.707 --> 36:07.918
I think you grew up
in a part of the country

36:08.001 --> 36:10.963
that didn't accept people like me
and possibly you.

36:11.630 --> 36:16.009
And I think that you are repressed,
if you want my honest opinion.

36:17.803 --> 36:19.304
You know, this was a mistake.

36:20.222 --> 36:21.223
Okay.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.518
-Go live in your delusional world--
-I'm not delusional, Laura.

36:24.601 --> 36:27.855
And I'm not a country bumpkin,
and I'm not fucking repressed.

36:36.738 --> 36:39.283
-You're gonna have to pay for that.
-Well, you better start a tab.

36:39.366 --> 36:42.119
'Cause I'm gonna be breaking a lot
of shit around here. I'm not repressed.

36:42.202 --> 36:45.497
I guess you'll have to find
some other woman's vases to break then.

36:46.915 --> 36:48.083
Fine. I'll start now.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.691
How you feeling?

37:12.774 --> 37:15.986
Like I'm about to eat shit
for reasons I don't understand.

37:16.069 --> 37:17.070
And you?

37:17.821 --> 37:20.490
Like I'm always eating shit
for reasons I don't understand.

37:20.574 --> 37:22.534
At least you're not being accused
of being racist.

37:22.618 --> 37:25.287
I mean, I don't think I've used
that phrase, "spirit animal,"

37:25.370 --> 37:26.496
before, like, a week ago.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.749
I thought that was just
something people said.

37:28.832 --> 37:30.626
People are so caught up
in their own nonsense.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.461
It takes up so much space in their head.

37:32.544 --> 37:35.464
There's no room for anyone else
unless they put 'em in these little boxes.

37:35.547 --> 37:39.593
I get it. But what I don't understand is
how'd they decide which box I belonged in?

37:39.676 --> 37:42.262
That's the thing that's tying my brain
in this Gordian knot.

37:42.346 --> 37:45.265
Like, how did I become Daniel,
the guy without the "it" factor?

37:46.517 --> 37:48.393
Back in 30 seconds, people.

37:49.061 --> 37:50.229
Well, I wish I could help,

37:50.312 --> 37:53.815
but just about that time for Yanko,
the racially insensitive Cuban weatherman,

37:53.899 --> 37:54.983
to eat that shit.

38:02.658 --> 38:04.034
Stand by, 1.

38:04.117 --> 38:05.577
Take it, 1.

38:05.661 --> 38:07.871
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders…

38:07.955 --> 38:11.500
Mia, I have no clue why he called me,

38:11.583 --> 38:14.920
but Bernadette Peters's agent just told me
she's not gonna make it in time.

38:16.338 --> 38:17.798
So much for special surprises.

38:17.881 --> 38:20.759
Okay, let's just get a surprise at least.

38:20.843 --> 38:23.720
Talk to Matt. Try to wrangle somebody
who's already in the building.

38:23.804 --> 38:26.557
-He'll know who's here this early. Hurry.
-Got it. Got it. Okay.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.433
What happened to COVID-18?

38:28.517 --> 38:33.730
Hey, so Bullard is pre-taping
right now upstairs with Stern.

38:34.565 --> 38:37.150
-Shit. Yes. Brilliant. Yeah.
-Okay. Yeah. It's on 8.

38:37.234 --> 38:38.777
-Thank you.
-Okay.

38:39.444 --> 38:40.821
-What you doing?
-Vermont senator…

38:40.904 --> 38:43.031
I was telling her Bullard's doing
a pre-tape with Stern.

38:43.115 --> 38:44.741
Howard was talking about it last week, so…

38:44.825 --> 38:46.952
Don't undermine me with my staff.

38:47.035 --> 38:50.163
-…coverage tonight on UBA Evening News.
-I was trying to help.

38:50.247 --> 38:52.124
Then don't fucking undermine my authority.

38:52.207 --> 38:53.542
Do you not want me here?

38:53.625 --> 38:58.505
…illness caused by the novel coronavirus
that's making its way across the globe.

38:58.589 --> 39:00.716
COVID-19 is what they're calling it.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.053
And that's your update for today
in the eight o'clock hour.

39:05.137 --> 39:06.138
Everything okay?

39:06.221 --> 39:09.016
…135 people quarantined
on the Diamond Princess.

39:09.099 --> 39:10.100
Hunky dory.

39:10.184 --> 39:12.936
-Not the vacation people had in mind…
-Just need a new special guest.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.104
Absolutely not. No.

39:14.188 --> 39:16.690
Before we move on,
you wanted to say something, Yanko?

39:16.773 --> 39:21.570
Yes, I do. I do.
So, back on Groundhog Day

39:21.653 --> 39:25.073
I flippantly used
the term "spirit animal"

39:25.157 --> 39:28.911
to describe how I felt
about Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog.

39:28.994 --> 39:33.040
And since then,
it's been brought to my attention that,

39:33.123 --> 39:36.126
as somebody
without any Native American heritage,

39:36.210 --> 39:38.003
that for me to use that term,

39:38.086 --> 39:40.797
that it might be considered insensitive,

39:40.881 --> 39:42.883
-as it misappropriates…
-Of course he said "might be." Fuck.

39:42.966 --> 39:45.886
…what many Native Americans,
hold to be sacred,

39:45.969 --> 39:47.513
culturally and spiritually.

39:47.596 --> 39:51.266
Those who know me best,
which I hope includes our regular viewers,

39:51.350 --> 39:53.435
know that I--
I'd never say something that--

39:53.519 --> 39:56.438
to intentionally
make light of another culture,

39:56.522 --> 39:58.190
and it pains me to know that…

39:58.273 --> 40:00.984
-That's not gonna make #YankYanko go away.
-…some of you…

40:01.068 --> 40:02.611
You're done going easy on your weatherman.

40:02.694 --> 40:05.280
-And for that I sincerely apologize.
-I'm using your office.

40:05.364 --> 40:09.451
And I will continue to try to learn
and do better.

40:11.620 --> 40:13.038
-Hey. Good morning, Cory.
-All right.

40:13.121 --> 40:14.998
So where do we stand
on the moderators?

40:15.082 --> 40:17.167
-This has to get done today.
-Eric's a go.

40:17.251 --> 40:19.920
So is Deena Pham from the Alt Weekly
for the local angle.

40:20.003 --> 40:22.172
-And?
-I'm leading with what I know.

40:22.256 --> 40:24.007
If you're asking about Alex,
she won't do it.

40:24.675 --> 40:27.177
I mean, I'll say it again, Noorean.

40:27.261 --> 40:31.557
But if that doesn't do it for you,
there's Daniel, Roger, Bradley.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.976
They've all made it clear
that they'd kill for it.

40:34.977 --> 40:37.312
Jesus. God.

40:37.396 --> 40:41.817
All I am trying to do is
get us to mid-March in one fucking piece

40:41.900 --> 40:44.695
so we can launch this streaming service,
which the world is mad about,

40:44.778 --> 40:47.656
like we're gonna force-feed them
content to make human foie gras.

40:47.739 --> 40:51.326
So if I can't count on you to do this,
why did I give you the job?

40:51.410 --> 40:56.290
You didn't have to sell us your company.
You chose this shit. This is the job.

40:56.373 --> 40:59.293
You know, I've been wondering
the same thing myself.

40:59.376 --> 41:01.086
Why did you bring me on?

41:01.170 --> 41:03.755
What was the point if you weren't gonna
listen to anything I say?

41:03.839 --> 41:05.424
So you can parade an Asian woman around

41:05.507 --> 41:08.552
and get the social capital
from pretending you cared?

41:08.635 --> 41:10.679
Don't just pay lip service
to empowering me.

41:10.762 --> 41:12.723
Either really do it or let me walk.

41:12.806 --> 41:16.226
Alex was never my choice for anything.
If that's who you want, do it yourself.

41:16.310 --> 41:19.646
You are underestimating me,
and you're underestimating Alex.

41:19.730 --> 41:23.108
So cut that shit. Talent is talent.

41:23.192 --> 41:26.361
And understanding that is
an executive's only talent.

41:26.445 --> 41:28.530
Generational talents
on multi-year contracts

41:28.614 --> 41:31.867
who happen to meet your
exacting standards, good fucking luck.

41:31.950 --> 41:36.205
So make this work now or don't.

41:36.288 --> 41:37.831
And see who you're spiting.

41:37.915 --> 41:41.710
Got it. Everything done the same
by a young, Asian woman equals different.

41:50.844 --> 41:51.845
Shit.

41:56.350 --> 41:57.351
What?

42:06.818 --> 42:08.779
-Yeah?
-It's Earl.

42:08.862 --> 42:09.863
Well, that was quick.

42:09.947 --> 42:13.825
Didn't take long to see the genie wasn't
going back in to retract the stories.

42:13.909 --> 42:16.912
Just too many blogs,
sites, papers, whatever.

42:16.995 --> 42:19.206
It won't be the Times,
but someone will publish.

42:19.289 --> 42:21.583
People are rotten.
It's why I have a business.

42:21.667 --> 42:24.628
Only thing I can see doing,
the extrajudicial being off the table,

42:24.711 --> 42:25.754
is go directly to Fred,

42:25.838 --> 42:27.631
which you didn't want me to do, correct?

42:27.714 --> 42:29.508
Yeah. Thanks.

42:38.684 --> 42:40.269
I'm looking forward to The Twist.

42:52.114 --> 42:53.115
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

42:53.198 --> 42:54.783
-How you doing?
-Good. Good.

42:54.867 --> 42:56.827
-How are you?
-Good, good.

42:56.910 --> 42:58.954
-Just getting through the show.
-Yeah.

42:59.037 --> 43:01.665
With a lot of "Welcome back, Alex"
over the top, but…

43:02.875 --> 43:06.211
It's gotta be a lot.
And then the debate prep is… That's--

43:06.295 --> 43:08.714
Oh, yeah. No, I'm--
I'm not doing the debate.

43:09.339 --> 43:11.925
-What do you mean? You turned it down?
-I'm not doing it. I did.

43:12.009 --> 43:15.512
And listen, if you want to do it,

43:15.596 --> 43:19.683
I would throw yourself at it right now
because she's like a dog with a bone. Sh--

43:19.766 --> 43:21.518
Alex, you're up in a minute.

43:22.227 --> 43:23.770
-To be continued.
-Okay.

43:28.150 --> 43:30.652
Gayle. Yeah, is Stella still here?

43:30.736 --> 43:32.154
I saw her a minute ago.

43:32.237 --> 43:34.948
-How much longer do I have?
-About six minutes. Why?

43:35.032 --> 43:36.116
I'll be right back.

43:37.367 --> 43:39.536
Okay, we're back in seven seconds.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.873
What's the pianist doing?
Bernadette's not here. We killed the song.

43:42.956 --> 43:43.999
Camera 2.

43:45.209 --> 43:48.420
And we are so happy to have Alex back,

43:48.504 --> 43:52.466
as you can tell from all the great guests
we've had already this week.

43:52.549 --> 43:54.635
-Daniel, what are you doing?
-You know…

43:54.718 --> 43:59.056
-Get back on script.
-…it's an interesting time in America.

43:59.139 --> 44:00.849
-What the hell is happening?
-We, the people,

44:00.933 --> 44:02.434
are asking tough questions.

44:02.518 --> 44:04.019
-The fuck?
-Our candidates…

44:04.102 --> 44:06.522
-Isabella?
-I had Howard Stern.

44:06.605 --> 44:08.273
And we're just all looking to live…

44:08.357 --> 44:10.526
-Stick with it. Stick with it.
-Stick with it.

44:11.860 --> 44:15.864
And when I think of the American dream…

44:16.949 --> 44:19.117
I think of one person in particular.

44:22.996 --> 44:25.916
And so this song is in her honor.

44:29.461 --> 44:31.088
I don't see copy for this.

44:32.172 --> 44:37.344
Far
We've been traveling far

44:37.427 --> 44:38.428
Good God.

44:38.512 --> 44:40.305
Without a home

44:40.389 --> 44:42.266
-Is this normal?
-No.

44:42.349 --> 44:45.227
But not without a star

44:46.812 --> 44:52.067
Free
Only want to be free

44:52.985 --> 44:56.405
We huddle close

44:56.488 --> 44:59.783
Hang on to a dream

45:02.035 --> 45:04.538
On the boats and on the planes

45:05.622 --> 45:08.292
They're comin' to America

45:08.375 --> 45:10.460
Stella. Hey.

45:12.629 --> 45:13.714
I have something to say.

45:14.298 --> 45:16.675
Can you talk in my dressing room?

45:16.758 --> 45:19.261
It won't take long.
I have to be back on air in a minute.

45:19.344 --> 45:21.096
-Sure. What the hell.
-Great.

45:23.140 --> 45:24.474
Yeah.

45:25.184 --> 45:26.185
So…

45:29.146 --> 45:31.273
-I want to talk to you about the debate.
-Oh, Christ.

45:31.356 --> 45:34.735
Look, I know everybody is coming at you,
and I don't need to come at you too.

45:34.818 --> 45:37.946
And I'm not gonna argue
my political acumen

45:38.030 --> 45:41.033
or my intellectual merits
or any of that bullshit.

45:41.116 --> 45:44.203
Quite frankly, I know that you want Alex
to moderate the debate,

45:44.286 --> 45:46.705
and I respect that,
and I think she would be great.

45:47.331 --> 45:50.584
However, I think that I can offer

45:50.667 --> 45:54.379
a perspective that Alex doesn't
and that Eric doesn't.

45:54.880 --> 45:59.676
And… this is just something
I barely acknowledge about myself

45:59.760 --> 46:05.599
because, quite honestly,
I just don't know how I feel about it.

46:06.183 --> 46:09.937
But I want to be truthful.

46:17.861 --> 46:19.029
I'm…

46:23.116 --> 46:24.117
I'm…

46:29.289 --> 46:32.417
from a Southern, conservative family.

46:35.045 --> 46:39.675
And I think it would be more inclusive
if I asked questions

46:39.758 --> 46:43.804
from the background
of a person who comes from a…

46:45.055 --> 46:47.015
conservative, Southern background,

46:47.099 --> 46:49.810
I mean, you know,
questions they might ask.

46:49.893 --> 46:51.979
Today

46:52.062 --> 46:53.564
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

46:53.647 --> 46:56.942
Today, today

46:57.025 --> 46:58.777
Today

46:58.861 --> 47:01.029
Today

47:01.113 --> 47:03.407
Today

47:04.324 --> 47:07.744
My country 'tis of thee

47:08.620 --> 47:12.291
Sweet land of liberty

47:14.126 --> 47:16.336
Of thee I sing

47:16.420 --> 47:18.839
We should--
We should take him out for a drink later.

47:18.922 --> 47:21.592
Of thee I sing

47:21.675 --> 47:24.303
Today

47:25.345 --> 47:27.472
Today

47:35.105 --> 47:36.607
-Stella.
-Yeah? What's up?

47:36.690 --> 47:39.651
I sent Unilever yesterday's TMS overnight.

47:39.735 --> 47:41.737
-Uh-huh.
-They just made a huge buy for Dove.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.655
They hadn't bought since before Alex left.

47:43.739 --> 47:44.990
Wow. That's-- Glad to hear it.

47:45.073 --> 47:47.784
Big week for us. Is that Daniel singing?

47:47.868 --> 47:51.455
But seriously, it's gonna be the best
February sweeps since I've been here.

47:51.538 --> 47:55.209
I think we'll get CPM up to 30%
for the foreseeable, thanks to Alex.

47:55.292 --> 47:56.668
Thanks to you.

47:56.752 --> 47:57.961
Swing by later.

47:58.045 --> 47:59.796
-I'll show you the numbers.
-Okay, cool.

48:02.090 --> 48:05.219
Today

48:08.180 --> 48:09.181
Today!

48:11.141 --> 48:17.147
Three, give me Daniel. Take 3.
Four, wide. Take it, 4.

48:20.025 --> 48:21.068
God!

48:22.945 --> 48:25.864
-Cut to Alex. Cut to Alex.
-Wow! What?

48:26.490 --> 48:28.825
Oh, my gosh!

48:28.909 --> 48:32.538
-Here comes Alex. Two, get her.
-What on earth just happened?

48:32.621 --> 48:35.207
-Daniel! Oh, my God! Daniel!
-For you, Alex.

48:35.290 --> 48:38.085
-Nice job. Stay with her.
-That was incredible!

48:38.168 --> 48:40.212
-Thank you for that.
-Welcome back.

48:40.921 --> 48:42.381
So sweet.

48:43.632 --> 48:47.177
I mean, God, I knew you had a voice,
but that was--

48:47.928 --> 48:50.389
Oh, my gosh. Are you-- Bradley? Yanko?

48:52.516 --> 48:54.726
-Hey, great show.
-Thanks, man.

48:58.814 --> 49:00.524
What the fuck was that, Bojangles?

49:28.927 --> 49:29.928
Yeah!

49:31.388 --> 49:33.932
Oh, my God.
Stella, why are you doing this?

49:34.516 --> 49:38.187
I'm giving you the answer that you want.
I'm gonna tell Cory you tried. I promise.

49:39.438 --> 49:41.857
Alex, I know you have
way more experience than I do,

49:41.940 --> 49:43.692
but you don't know what I want.

49:43.775 --> 49:47.237
Because what I want in its broadest terms
has very little to do with you.

49:47.321 --> 49:49.239
What I want is to change things here.

49:50.616 --> 49:54.119
Put yourself in my shoes.
Alex. Alex, look at me.

49:54.703 --> 49:55.871
Yes.

49:55.954 --> 49:58.332
If you were me,
wouldn't you want to start fresh?

49:58.415 --> 49:59.917
-I suppose I would.
-Okay.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.295
I think we would all love to start fresh,
but we don't all have that opportunity.

50:03.378 --> 50:05.464
-Right.
-I am what I am.

50:05.547 --> 50:07.090
All right. Here it is.

50:07.174 --> 50:08.175
I'm young. I get it.

50:08.258 --> 50:10.636
-I'd be annoyed by me too, if I were you--
-No, no, no, no.

50:10.719 --> 50:13.972
No, that's not why I'm saying no.
Don't-- Don't even--

50:14.056 --> 50:15.641
-Okay, just hear me out.
-Yes, okay.

50:16.350 --> 50:20.437
This place was a rotten mess,
and you were living in it for 15 years.

50:20.521 --> 50:22.981
I said it was a rotten mess. I said it.

50:23.065 --> 50:25.317
I know I shouldn't lump you
into the rotten mess,

50:25.400 --> 50:27.152
because you tried to change it. You tried.

50:27.236 --> 50:28.612
-Yes.
-That's the same thing I want.

50:28.695 --> 50:32.574
You tried. But the jury's still out
as to whether or not you've succeeded.

50:32.658 --> 50:34.034
And I'm here as a result.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.786
-I'm sorry about that.
-Excuse me.

50:35.869 --> 50:37.829
Wow. Yes. Yes.

50:37.913 --> 50:39.206
And I'm 33.

50:39.289 --> 50:41.750
And, you know,
I don't know the things I don't know.

50:41.834 --> 50:46.088
I know that. But I do know some things
that other people don't know,

50:46.171 --> 50:48.549
and other people don't always want
to know that.

50:48.632 --> 50:52.052
-You know what I mean?
-I do. Yep. No, I do. I do.

50:52.135 --> 50:54.513
I know you don't want to
or need to do this debate,

50:54.596 --> 50:56.014
but I want you to do it.

50:56.098 --> 50:57.850
And the reason why is because of exactly

50:57.933 --> 51:00.435
what you did nine months ago here
that changed everything,

51:00.519 --> 51:03.313
that brought me here in front of you
asking you to do this.

51:03.397 --> 51:06.233
You earned a connection
to the women of this country.

51:11.280 --> 51:14.950
I'm not…
I'm not quite sure that that's true.

51:15.033 --> 51:17.411
It is. You mean something, Alex.

51:17.494 --> 51:23.041
You do. As a leader, as a feminist.
And I want you to be these things for me.

51:23.125 --> 51:26.086
And, by the way, if you're looking
for a brand, there it is.

51:26.628 --> 51:29.089
I don't know why
you don't want to take that mantle,

51:29.756 --> 51:34.761
because nine months ago you opened a door,
and you need to walk through it now.

51:34.845 --> 51:37.222
And we both know that. Okay?

51:38.348 --> 51:39.558
Okay.

51:40.767 --> 51:43.729
Anyway, it was a great show today.

51:44.479 --> 51:45.480
Thank you.

52:06.627 --> 52:08.045
Yeah.

52:08.128 --> 52:13.759
Hey, the professor you so kindly got me
the interview with, he just called.

52:13.842 --> 52:15.177
He has coronavirus.

52:16.261 --> 52:18.388
I was with him for a few hours.

52:19.223 --> 52:23.268
Now, I don't know if I did get it,
if I could have given it to you,

52:23.352 --> 52:25.812
but I was with you
for a few hours in a car.

52:25.896 --> 52:28.690
It's totally crazy. It's bad.

52:28.774 --> 52:31.527
There are many cases, and it's everywhere.

52:32.069 --> 52:33.362
Yeah. Fuck.

52:34.071 --> 52:36.031
They are saying we have to quarantine.

52:36.114 --> 52:39.618
And it's a long time to spend alone.

52:42.120 --> 52:44.206
We could work on the documentary.

52:45.541 --> 52:47.251
What do you think?

53:05.352 --> 53:06.353
Hey.

53:08.564 --> 53:10.816
I know I have a lot of nerve
showing up here.

53:13.026 --> 53:14.361
I got you this.

53:15.779 --> 53:19.575
It's a gift card. $300.

53:22.035 --> 53:25.330
I didn't know what to--
I-- Look, I don't know who I am.

53:25.414 --> 53:27.916
I don't--
I know I'm a total pain in the ass,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.502
but I just-- I want to tell you that

53:30.586 --> 53:33.630
because I want you to know
that I know that I am.

53:40.596 --> 53:42.222
Please. Please.

54:13.128 --> 54:16.131
I need a minute with Cybil,
if I can get you to clear the room.

54:16.215 --> 54:17.341
Thank you.

54:24.306 --> 54:28.060
Well, this is a new one on me.
I can only imagine.

54:29.394 --> 54:30.562
I need your help.

54:31.605 --> 54:35.651
Fred is planting nasty stories
about Hannah Shoenfeld in the press.

54:35.734 --> 54:39.571
I mean, it's gross.
I don't care if her father is suing us.

54:39.655 --> 54:41.323
Frankly, I understand. I--

54:41.406 --> 54:47.579
Look, I get it.
Losing a child is… unimaginable pain.

54:48.830 --> 54:53.126
But it is not our responsibility
to make it okay for this poor guy.

54:53.210 --> 54:56.338
And trust me,
it won't make it okay for him.

54:56.421 --> 54:59.007
Nothing will.
So, what do you want me to do about it?

54:59.091 --> 55:02.344
I want you to talk to Fred
and tell him to kill the stories.

55:02.427 --> 55:04.388
He's not gonna listen to me,
and you're friends--

55:04.471 --> 55:05.848
That guy's not my friend.

55:07.099 --> 55:08.642
The last time I talked to him,

55:08.725 --> 55:12.187
he sat me down and told me that you were
objectively the best business decision.

55:12.271 --> 55:14.982
Now, I really don't think so.

55:15.065 --> 55:19.111
You let the talent walk all over you,
if you can call Bradley Jackson talent,

55:19.194 --> 55:22.030
and you pushed us hard to pay out Fred

55:22.114 --> 55:25.576
rather than have
a truly independent investigation.

55:26.910 --> 55:29.955
That brings up all sorts of questions.

55:30.038 --> 55:32.040
Questions I don't need answered.

55:32.875 --> 55:35.752
This is a business, not a morality play.

55:35.836 --> 55:37.754
So don't lay that trip on me.

55:38.380 --> 55:40.674
If the stories he's planting aren't true,

55:40.757 --> 55:44.761
then the girl's family will have
a hell of a libel case on their hands.

55:44.845 --> 55:48.557
The fact that you showed up here
rather than calling Fred directly

55:48.640 --> 55:53.061
tells me everything I need to know
about why Fred pushed so hard for you

55:53.145 --> 55:55.814
when he clearly hated you with a passion.

55:57.774 --> 56:00.235
Two shitty peas in one shitty pod.

56:00.319 --> 56:04.323
I guess it's time to face the fact
that actions have consequences,

56:04.406 --> 56:06.909
and I keep my temple clean.

56:06.992 --> 56:13.457
So whatever those consequences are
is really none of my business.

56:16.793 --> 56:18.420
Give my regards to Fred.
