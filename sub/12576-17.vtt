WEBVTT

00:53.887 --> 00:55.096
Ahh!

01:01.186 --> 01:02.353
Hmm?

01:05.065 --> 01:09.110
No! No! No! These are my personal,
private undergarments.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.154
Now the whole neighborhood
knows I wear them.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.280
Well, I am sorry, Hank.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.990
The dryer broke... again.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.992
It's actually moistening our clothes now.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.286
Okay, okay, we'll buy a new dryer.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.789
Just help me get the rest of these down.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.124
Mm-hm.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.463
Let's buy this one.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.881
It's like watching TV,

01:29.881 --> 01:32.383
only the show is about wet clothes.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.052
Hi, you folks have any questions?

01:34.052 --> 01:36.262
Why, yes, I do.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.764
Could you tell me the difference

01:37.764 --> 01:40.725
between an electric dryer
and a propane dryer?

01:40.809 --> 01:42.852
Sure. A propane dryer
costs a little more...

01:42.936 --> 01:44.479
Ah, only at first.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.357
When you factor in the lifetime
cost of ownership

01:47.357 --> 01:49.192
propane comes out on top.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.527
Let me run through the numbers.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.780
A family of four does three
and a half loads a week.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.865
Hey. Hey.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.784
Hello, Buckley!

01:57.784 --> 01:58.993
Hey.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.454
When did you get promoted to greeter?

02:01.704 --> 02:02.580
Yester-- hey...

02:02.664 --> 02:03.832
- day.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.043
And if the current trend
in electric rates continues,

02:07.127 --> 02:08.837
you'll be glad you did.

02:08.837 --> 02:09.879
Here's my card

02:09.963 --> 02:11.506
in case you have any other questions.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.800
Can we just take the Spinmore, please?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.469
Would you be interested
in applying for a Mega Lo card?

02:16.553 --> 02:17.846
Heh. No, thanks.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.640
The last thing I need
is another credit card.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.058
I've already got one.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.352
Hold on. No money down,

02:24.352 --> 02:26.437
no interest for six months

02:26.729 --> 02:29.274
and ten percent off our first purchase.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.692
Ten percent off?

02:30.692 --> 02:32.861
Well, Chuck Mangione supports it

02:32.861 --> 02:35.613
and his diet shakes did okay by me.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.076
Hi, Luanne.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.202
Hi, Bobby.

02:41.744 --> 02:42.620
Hi, Buckley.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.457
He's on break.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.960
Where's Uncle Hank and Aunt Peggy?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.129
Oh, I thought
I'd give them some time alone

02:51.254 --> 02:53.089
so they could, you know...

02:54.090 --> 02:55.008
What?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.551
You know.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.636
Buy me a birthday present.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.972
I mean, that's why we're here, isn't it?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.432
I don't think so.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.517
Your birthday's not till next month.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.060
Think about it, Luanne.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.855
Why would you bring a child
to a department store

03:08.855 --> 03:09.898
to buy a dryer

03:09.898 --> 03:12.066
when his birthday
is three and a half weeks away?

03:12.150 --> 03:13.568
It just doesn't make sense.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.654
They're watching me,
trying to get into my head.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.157
See what I really want in a present.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.368
No. I'm pretty sure
we're just buying a dryer.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.537
Okay, Luanne.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.625
When mom and dad get done
buying the dryer,

03:28.625 --> 03:31.211
tell them I'm over by the dirt bikes,

03:31.211 --> 03:32.754
holding a Toblerone.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.758
Hey.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.051
- Okay, Mr. Hill...

03:38.051 --> 03:40.261
- ...your credit has been rejected?

03:40.345 --> 03:42.055
- Huh? But why?

03:42.055 --> 03:44.891
Well, the computer doesn't say.
I'm sorry. Next.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.935
Hold on a minute. You made a mistake.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.895
I have perfect credit.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.732
I think I recognize a frowny face
when I see one.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.026
Hank, why don't we just pay with a check?

03:55.026 --> 03:58.112
Ah, sorry. We can't take checks
from people with bad credit.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.700
- I'm having the time of my life.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.661
And it's on sale.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.830
<i>Thanks for trying, Melinda,</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:10.208
but I'm pretty sure you can't just
look up my credit

04:10.208 --> 04:12.377
unless I send some kind
of permission letter

04:12.377 --> 04:13.670
to my credit bureau.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.921
Nah, it's a piece of cake.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.965
All you need is a $10 processing fee.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.259
And I'll just deduct that
from your paycheck.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.135
Mr. Strickland, uh...

04:21.219 --> 04:24.180
- I was just, uh, you know...
- Hank's got bad credit.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.849
Well, there's the rat hair in your tuna.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.812
Seems like you're in the hole $40
to Arlen Video.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.272
What?

04:33.064 --> 04:36.025
It says I owe $40, and that can't be true.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.986
I always bring back my tapes.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.863
Look for yourself.
I've returned <i>The Great Santini</i>

04:40.947 --> 04:42.073
23 times.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.742
- Okay. Hank Hill. June 23.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.245
Yeah, you rented and never
returned <i>Cuffs & Collars.</i>

04:47.245 --> 04:49.664
I've never even heard of that. Have you?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.416
Uh-uh. Unless he's got the name Merchant,

04:51.416 --> 04:53.668
Ivory or Billy Crystal above the title,

04:53.668 --> 04:54.877
I am not interested.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.839
Wait a minute.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.383
They're buying me a movie for my birthday.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.010
That's why we're here, right?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.846
Really, Bobby, they haven't said anything.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.806
Bobby, you ever heard of a movie

05:06.806 --> 05:08.683
called <i>Cuffs & Collars?</i>

05:08.683 --> 05:11.853
Oh, I think that's the one
with the two cops who don't get along,

05:11.853 --> 05:13.604
but then they do, but it's too late

05:13.688 --> 05:15.440
'cause he's dead, but not really.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.524
So you've seen it?

05:16.524 --> 05:17.900
No.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.110
How about you, Luanne?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.445
Mm-mmm.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.865
Oh, no. You're not getting a movie, Bobby.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.951
You are so smooth.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.453
Nope, we didn't rent it.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.913
So if you could please erase the $40

05:30.997 --> 05:33.624
and penalize yourself,
whatever you think is fair,

05:33.708 --> 05:35.001
we'll be on our way.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.503
I am sorry. The computer
won't let me erase anything

05:37.587 --> 05:40.340
until you either return
the tape, or pay the $40.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.258
I told you, I didn't rent the tape.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.594
Now, who's calling me a liar,
you or the machine?

05:44.594 --> 05:46.387
'Cause I want to know whose arse to kick.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.097
I'm not calling you a liar, sir.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.309
Fine. Now, where's the arse on this thing?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.394
I need a dryer, Hank.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.645
Just pay for the tape.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.314
Absolutely not.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.775
I won't pay for someone else's screw up.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.109
Heck, I wouldn't be surprised

06:00.193 --> 06:02.820
if that tape was sitting
on the shelf right now.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.281
Where would <i>Cuffs & Collars</i> be?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.532
Action adventure?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.076
Action comedy?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.160
Action action?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.328
Make a left.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.621
Okay.

06:19.587 --> 06:20.922
Mmm.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.428
How could they think
I'd rent a stag film, Peggy?

06:27.512 --> 06:28.721
I'm married.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.139
I think we should just pay.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.767
No! I've got to prove my innocence.

06:32.767 --> 06:36.145
Now, wasn't June 23rd
the day I went to my dad's

06:36.229 --> 06:38.481
and installed grab bars in his shower?

06:38.481 --> 06:41.734
Nope. June 23rd,
I played boggle at Nancy's

06:41.818 --> 06:42.985
and left you home.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.612
Alone.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.032
Peggy, you don't think
I actually rented...

06:48.116 --> 06:50.284
Oh, Hank. I don't care
if you did or you didn't.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.370
Well, you should care, because I didn't!

06:52.370 --> 06:54.205
Oh, really, Hank, it doesn't matter.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.581
It does matter!

06:55.665 --> 06:59.544
It's important you believe me
when I say I didn't rent the tape.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.379
Honey, okay, I believe you.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.589
Now, I just have one question.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.800
- Did you rent the tape?
- No!

07:05.800 --> 07:06.968
All right, then.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.386
But whether you did or you didn't,

07:08.386 --> 07:10.346
- I still think we should just pay.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.266
The last thing I want
is for people to be talking about this.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.851
Especially in front of Bobby.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.687
Luanne, Luanne!

07:17.812 --> 07:19.981
It's even better than I thought!

07:19.981 --> 07:22.817
Mom and dad are throwing me
a surprise party!

07:24.694 --> 07:26.529
So, Nancy tells me

07:26.529 --> 07:29.449
she ran into John Redcorn
at the video store.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.200
The two of them heard you complaining

07:31.284 --> 07:34.328
about some porno tape you lost.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.747
Yeah, man! Talk about that dang ol'
<i>Cuffs and Collars</i>, man.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.333
Like when they come over to clean
that pool, man. Start goin' like

07:39.417 --> 07:41.294
a-wakka wakka-wakka...

07:41.502 --> 07:43.963
Quit it! I didn't rent that movie!

07:43.963 --> 07:47.341
I'm glad. I'm glad. I'm not the only one

07:47.425 --> 07:50.386
who is disgusted by pornography.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.679
It's offensive.

07:51.679 --> 07:52.972
It's demeaning.

07:52.972 --> 07:59.312
It creates a standard of idealized beauty
that your average man can't compete with.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.271
Don't worry, Bill.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.149
I'm not going to let my credit
and good name be done in

08:03.149 --> 08:04.942
by a darn computer error.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.944
Computers don't make errors.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.114
- What they do, they do on purpose.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.618
By now, your name and particulars
have been fed into every laptop,

08:13.618 --> 08:16.162
desktop, mainframe and supermarket scanner

08:16.162 --> 08:19.081
that collectively make up
the global information conspiracy,

08:19.165 --> 08:21.709
otherwise known as The Beast.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.254
Dale, I'm having a problem
with one videotape,

08:25.463 --> 08:28.174
not some kind of high-tech bogeyman.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.634
You just be careful.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.637
Computers have already beaten
the communists at chess.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.681
Next thing you know,
they'll be beating humans.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.270
Strickland Propane.
Taste the meat, not the heat.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.522
<i>Hello, Hank?</i>

08:42.522 --> 08:44.774
- Speaking.
<i>- How you doing? It's Matt!</i>

08:45.733 --> 08:48.444
Oh. Hey... Matt, how you been?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.196
<i>Pretty good, pretty good.</i>

08:50.321 --> 08:51.197
Uh-huh.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.490
So, uh...

08:52.490 --> 08:54.784
- How's, um... Peggy?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.452
Uh, she's fine.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.745
And how's, uh...

08:58.704 --> 08:59.956
- Do I know you?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.833
Hank, if you liked <i>Cuffs and Collars</i>,
you're gonna love <i>Rug Burn</i>, too...

09:02.917 --> 09:05.878
and by "<i>Rug Burn</i> too" I mean <i>Rug Burn</i>
also. <i>Rug Burn Two</i> isn't very good.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.964
What? But... uh, who is this?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.966
You know, Matt from Consenting Adults,

09:09.966 --> 09:12.635
the country's largest supplier
of mail order adult entertainment.

09:12.635 --> 09:16.597
-<i>So, how many can I put you down for?</i>
- Zero! God! Please watch your mouth!

09:16.681 --> 09:18.683
This is an interstate phone line!

09:18.683 --> 09:20.226
How did you get this number?

09:20.226 --> 09:21.894
Not important. What is important

09:21.978 --> 09:24.855
is that we have a bigger selection
and lower prices than Arlen Video.

09:24.939 --> 09:28.818
What? Arlen Video told you
I rent pornography?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.112
Uh...

09:31.112 --> 09:32.947
Who plays the most hits?

09:33.489 --> 09:34.991
Y-104.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.242
Yeah, okay.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.369
- That crazy morning zoo.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.729
Shame on you, Hank Hill!

10:04.729 --> 10:07.940
What you do in the privacy
of your own home

10:08.024 --> 10:09.567
is disgusting enough

10:09.567 --> 10:12.695
but to let it spill out into our streets

10:12.695 --> 10:16.907
where my future children
will someday play?

10:16.991 --> 10:19.118
Well, that is going too far.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.037
Shame!

10:25.249 --> 10:26.626
Shame!

10:27.168 --> 10:30.379
I would like the luxury
of vomiting on myself right now,

10:30.463 --> 10:32.965
but I don't have any
clean clothes to change into.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.509
Would you just pay the bill
so I can get a new dryer?

10:35.593 --> 10:36.427
It's too late.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.138
The beast's already got him in its jaws.

10:39.513 --> 10:42.808
Your only way out is to start life over
with a new identity.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.061
If you want, I can get
you the birth certificate

10:45.061 --> 10:47.730
of a child who died in 1953.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.315
It's hardly been used.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.651
No! I am not a quitter!

10:51.651 --> 10:55.196
Who's not a quitter,
my dead friend, Hank Hill

10:55.196 --> 10:58.157
or my new friend, Rusty Shackleford?

10:58.741 --> 11:02.036
Look, just help me get this smut
back to the post office.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.917
Bobby! Do not get off the bus!

11:07.917 --> 11:10.503
Look at all those cards and gifts.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.964
This is going to be
the best birthday ever.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.677
Next.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.011
Uh, yes.

11:19.095 --> 11:23.933
These magazines and, uh, equipment
were delivered to my home.

11:24.266 --> 11:28.729
I want you to return to sender
and take my name off these mailing lists.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.981
No. Post office can't
take you off the mailing list.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.068
You need to call the company
you bought your pornography from...

11:34.068 --> 11:36.153
I don't buy pornography!

11:36.237 --> 11:37.154
I don't want this!

11:37.238 --> 11:38.364
Take it back!

11:41.534 --> 11:43.994
If you want to file a complaint,
fill out this form.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.288
- We'll enter it in the computer, and...

11:46.372 --> 11:49.792
No! No forms! No computers!
We were never here!

11:49.792 --> 11:51.210
Don't feed The Beast!

11:51.585 --> 11:53.170
Mr. Hank Hill?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.256
You threw out your mail, son.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.466
Don't you want to prolong your lovemaking

11:57.550 --> 12:00.219
pleasure for just pennies
a night, Mr. Hank?

12:00.219 --> 12:03.180
Give me that! Don't you people understand?

12:03.264 --> 12:07.893
If I don't fight, someday it could be
your name on these... plugs.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.937
I'm doing this for all of you.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.231
Do you know this guy?

12:12.231 --> 12:14.233
No dadgum way, man!

12:14.233 --> 12:16.861
That, that's some dirty old man,
hangin' around sex toys, man.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.529
Back at my place, if you're interested.

12:18.529 --> 12:22.491
Boomhauer, no.
I can do without Bill by my side.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.785
He brings nothing to this fight, but you?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.204
You should have seen this coming, Hank.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.082
One by one, your friends will desert you.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.876
I'll be next.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.964
Now, Dale, this stuff about The Beast.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.008
You made all that up, right?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.092
Of course you did.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.469
Oh, no.

12:41.469 --> 12:45.139
Everything has been foretold
in the book of revelations.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.600
Uh, you just stepped in a diaper.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.686
- Darn it, it's the vice squad!

12:50.770 --> 12:53.272
They must have followed us!
Quick, Dale, bury the...

12:53.856 --> 12:55.107
Dale?

12:57.485 --> 12:59.445
Uh, sir, this is the municipal dump.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.529
All garbage must...

13:01.071 --> 13:02.114
Wait a minute.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.659
This Superglide is oil based.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.454
That's a petroleum by-product.
You can't throw that out here.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.289
Same with the batteries in your vibrator.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.874
This is not my vi...

13:12.291 --> 13:13.250
A-and it's not a...

13:13.918 --> 13:15.085
It's a wand massager.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.004
It says so right on the box.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.756
All right, give me your license.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.508
I'm going to run you through the computer.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.011
The compu... uh...

13:24.011 --> 13:27.306
I, I don't have my license on me
at the moment.

13:27.306 --> 13:32.144
Uh, but I can tell you
that I was born in 1953.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.522
As a child, I was quite ill.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.867
Surprise!

13:46.951 --> 13:49.620
What? I had no idea!

13:49.620 --> 13:51.080
When did you plan this?

13:52.331 --> 13:53.624
How was that, Luanne?

13:53.624 --> 13:54.834
Let's try it again.

13:56.961 --> 14:00.506
Woo... <i>♪ I'm playing
with the queen of hearts ♪</i>

14:01.215 --> 14:03.175
<i>♪ You know she isn't very sma... ♪</i>

14:03.259 --> 14:04.802
What the heck?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.391
Peggy. Thank God you're here.

14:11.767 --> 14:15.271
Hello. I'm Hank Hill,
and I'd like you to sign my petition.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.565
Hank Hill, I want you
to get in the car, right now,

14:17.565 --> 14:18.858
before the whole town sees you.

14:18.858 --> 14:23.279
No. I am not a quitter,
and I don't rent pornography.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.613
I'm begging you, Hank.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.948
Pay the $40.

14:25.948 --> 14:29.702
We will buy a new dryer,
and you can finally change your underwear.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.370
Honey, it's the right thing to do.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.498
Not until I prove my innocence
once and for all.

14:34.832 --> 14:38.502
That's why I'm taking Arlen Video
to small claims court, Peggy.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.921
I'm putting the whole system on trial.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.799
You have not heard a word I've said.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.509
What do I have to do
to get through to you?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.512
Do I have to take off my shirt
and dance like the women in your movies?

14:48.596 --> 14:50.639
I don't rent those movies!

14:50.723 --> 14:53.601
Hank, if you want to keep up
your silly little battle,

14:53.601 --> 14:55.019
then you go it alone.

14:55.936 --> 14:56.854
I am sorry.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.375
- Oh. Huh? Hmm?

15:18.459 --> 15:21.337
Oh, man, his trial is tomorrow,
and he's going in there

15:21.337 --> 15:24.006
with nothing but six honks
and one signature

15:24.006 --> 15:25.466
and that's on his leg.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.176
Darn taggers.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.510
It's sad, really.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.221
All he wanted was
for his clothes to be dry.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.473
Yup.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.641
Yup.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.892
Ho, yeah.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.522
<i>♪ You're a heart-breaker, dream maker ♪</i>

15:40.606 --> 15:43.484
<i>♪ A love taker, don't you
mess around, no, no, no ♪</i>

15:59.541 --> 16:01.877
Mom! Look what dad got me.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.712
There's <i>Cuffs and Collars</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:05.965
- and a whole bunch of other cop movies.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.841
<i>Jailbait, Hung Jury...</i>

16:07.925 --> 16:10.511
How dare you try
to expose my son to these...

16:11.095 --> 16:12.638
uh, police tapes?

16:12.638 --> 16:15.057
They're so degrading to, uh...

16:15.057 --> 16:16.850
law enforcement officials.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.310
You never saw these.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.938
Gotcha. It's a surprise.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.065
Don't worry. I didn't read the card.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.911
"I believe you, Hank.
The answer is in the tapes. A friend."

16:37.413 --> 16:38.497
Hmm...

16:39.581 --> 16:42.960
"I need these back when you're done.
A friend."

16:57.725 --> 16:58.726
Okay.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.982
MAN 1 (on video):
<i>Hey, did somebody call a plumber?</i>

17:05.649 --> 17:08.193
WOMAN 1 (on video): <i>Come on in.
I'll show you where the leak is.</i>

17:08.277 --> 17:11.321
Oh, not... No! Not... Oh!

17:11.405 --> 17:13.323
Oh, God!

17:18.078 --> 17:20.372
WOMAN 2 (on video):
<i>You want me to frisk you?</i>

17:20.998 --> 17:23.000
<i>Ohh. What kind of cop are you?</i>

17:23.417 --> 17:25.252
MAN 2 (on video): <i>Huh... A bad one.</i>

17:30.591 --> 17:34.762
Bobby, for the love of God,
get out of the house!

17:35.637 --> 17:36.764
Okay.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.810
My mom told us to stay away
for three hours.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.022
My birthday party must be today!

17:45.022 --> 17:48.108
Ooh! Then I guess this haircut is free.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.153
I'm still supposed to charge you
for the shampoo.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.363
WOMAN 2 (on video):
<i>Here. Let me hold that.</i>

17:53.447 --> 17:55.574
<i>Thanks, officer.</i>

17:55.574 --> 17:57.201
<i>Say, are you a mounted police?</i>

17:57.701 --> 17:58.786
WOMAN 2 (on video): <i>Not yet</i>

17:58.786 --> 18:00.829
- But a girl can dream.
<i>- But a girl can dream.</i>

18:00.913 --> 18:03.207
Wait a minute! That's it!

18:03.207 --> 18:04.541
That's it!

18:05.793 --> 18:07.294
Yeah! That's it!

18:11.090 --> 18:14.301
You are hereby ordered to pay
damages in the amount of $1.50

18:14.301 --> 18:16.220
and return the plaintiff's sunglasses.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.221
Ha!

18:18.847 --> 18:20.140
- Mm-hm.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.268
Next case.
Hank Hill versus Arlen Video.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.521
Mr. Hill, you allege

18:25.521 --> 18:28.315
that you have been the target
of systematic harassment

18:28.315 --> 18:30.275
at the hands of a major international

18:30.359 --> 18:33.737
computer conspiracy known as "The Beast."

18:33.862 --> 18:35.447
That is correct, Your Honor.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.951
- Oh.
- Mr. Hill, why don't you just pay the $40?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.328
Because I did not rent the tape,

18:41.662 --> 18:42.913
and I can prove it.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.082
It's pretty quiet.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.750
And there are no cars.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.169
I wonder where the magician parked?

18:52.339 --> 18:53.632
Surprise!

18:55.134 --> 18:56.510
Huh?

18:59.179 --> 19:00.597
It must be in my bedroom.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.559
Shh.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.102
- Surprise!

19:14.820 --> 19:16.655
<i>Cuffs and Collars.</i>

19:16.655 --> 19:18.490
The tape I never rented.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.450
68 minutes into the film

19:20.534 --> 19:24.830
actress Didi Cupp bends over
to shoe her horse.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.749
Now, if you pause the tape
and look closely,

19:27.833 --> 19:31.253
you can just make out
a tattoo on Didi's left buttock

19:31.253 --> 19:34.381
that reads I heart Charlie Sheen.

19:34.965 --> 19:39.344
Mrs. Cupps also makes
an uncredited cameo in <i>Jailbait</i>,

19:39.428 --> 19:43.599
a tape which marks veteran porn star,
Fernanda Valley's return

19:43.599 --> 19:45.267
to the adult film industry

19:45.267 --> 19:48.228
on the occasion of her 18th birthday.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.355
Now, at the 70-minute mark.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.066
Didi bends over to shoe a donkey.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.903
What do we see on her left buttock?

19:56.153 --> 19:57.404
Nothing.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.489
There is no tattoo.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.699
This can only mean

20:00.699 --> 20:05.287
that <i>Jailbait</i> was made
before <i>Cuffs and Collars.</i>

20:05.787 --> 20:07.706
Now, why is this important?

20:08.332 --> 20:12.419
Because Fernanda Valley
turned 18 on July 5,

20:12.419 --> 20:16.632
two weeks after I supposedly
rented <i>Cuffs and Collars.</i>

20:18.008 --> 20:22.512
Is it possible that I walked
into Arlen Video on June 23rd

20:22.596 --> 20:25.390
and rented a movie that didn't even exist?

20:26.016 --> 20:27.643
I think not!

20:32.648 --> 20:34.149
I rule in favor of the plaintiff.

20:34.608 --> 20:38.195
Arlen Video is hereby ordered
to remove the debt from its computer.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.197
- Mm-hm.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.865
And let the record show

20:41.949 --> 20:45.535
that Mr. Hank Hill really knows
his pornography.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.120
Thank you, Your Honor.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.504
Oh, you did it, Hank. You won.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.299
Oh, we can finally put
this nightmare behind us.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.384
Oh, no.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.135
This isn't over yet.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.356
Approved!

21:14.856 --> 21:16.108
The dryer's yours!

21:19.987 --> 21:22.406
I can't believe they forgot my birthday.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.741
Oh, don't worry.

21:24.825 --> 21:28.120
They still got a whole month to remember.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.873
- Yeah, man.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.792
You got me, Luanne.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.711
You knew the whole time, didn't you?

21:36.670 --> 21:37.546
Yeah.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.214
Yeah.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.632
I don't believe it.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.217
A dryer!

21:42.301 --> 21:43.385
It's perfect!

21:43.385 --> 21:44.720
Yup.

21:49.099 --> 21:52.436
<i>This is the best birthday ever.</i>

22:25.344 --> 22:28.096
<i>That dang ol'
a-wakka wakka-wakka...</i>
