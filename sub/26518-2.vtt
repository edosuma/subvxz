WEBVTT

00:13.883 --> 00:16.059
Is anyone gonna
know what we did?

00:16.103 --> 00:18.018
The right people will.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.325
Welcome to Zero Division.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.512
We're gonna
change the world.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.171
How about I go
and get us some dinner?

00:41.215 --> 00:44.000
That sounds perfect.
Yeah.

00:50.963 --> 00:54.271
Nice cover for your little,
uh, Jane Doe rehearsal.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.751
I hate him.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.101
I know.

00:58.145 --> 01:01.148
I want revenge.
For everything.

01:01.191 --> 01:04.368
For you, Oscar,
Dolan, our mother--

01:04.412 --> 01:06.153
So take it.

01:06.196 --> 01:09.069
We are gonna break our mother
out of that black site.

01:09.112 --> 01:12.115
We are gonna find
a cure for you,

01:12.159 --> 01:14.291
and then...

01:14.335 --> 01:17.164
we're gonna
kill Kurt Weller.

01:17.207 --> 01:20.254
So how do we do this?
Your grand plan?

01:20.297 --> 01:24.345
You mean yourgrand plan.
I'm not real, remember?

01:24.388 --> 01:26.738
And you're not Jane.

01:29.001 --> 01:32.135
First, we figure out where
Shepherd's being held.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.311
Once we know that,
we can figure out

01:34.355 --> 01:36.139
a way to bust her out.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.488
That's not gonna be easy.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.795
You got this.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.449
I know I do.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.842
I'm worried
I won't have time.

01:43.886 --> 01:46.497
None of our plans are
gonna mean anything...

01:46.541 --> 01:48.586
if I'm dead.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.501
You said it yourself.

01:50.545 --> 01:53.113
The fact that you're here,
that I'm talking

01:53.156 --> 01:55.550
to a hallucination
means I'm getting worse.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.247
It also means
you don't have to do

01:57.291 --> 01:58.509
any of this on your own.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.598
I will be with you
every step.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.731
I'm dying, Roman.

02:02.774 --> 02:06.213
And I left those
data caches for a reason.

02:06.256 --> 02:09.172
Follow them and they
will lead to a cure.

02:09.216 --> 02:12.132
If you had the cure,
why didn't you use it
on yourself?

02:12.175 --> 02:14.917
Maybe I didn't have it.
Maybe I just knew where it was

02:14.960 --> 02:16.527
and I ran out of time
to get it,

02:16.571 --> 02:18.877
but it's not
too late for you.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.967
You just gotta trust me
and stay the course.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.535
Now, let's figure out
where the hell

02:24.579 --> 02:26.581
the CIA's keeping Mom.

02:32.978 --> 02:35.503
Ladies and gentlemen,
guess who's biz

02:35.546 --> 02:37.331
The man, the myth,
the stubble!

02:37.374 --> 02:38.897
No hospital bed
can hold him!

02:38.941 --> 02:41.813
Kurtis I-don't-know-
his-middle-name Weller!

02:41.857 --> 02:43.293
Yeah!

02:43.337 --> 02:45.861
Thank you. We don't need
to do that again.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.776
Welcome back officially,
Special Agent Weller.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.952
Not a moment too soon,
either, between you and me,

02:49.995 --> 02:51.606
because when Reade says,
"Let's move,"

02:51.649 --> 02:54.348
it really lacks that grizzled
tough

02:54.391 --> 02:55.436
Ooh...No offense.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.307
Well, I'm sure he'll be back

02:57.351 --> 02:59.701
to barking orders and righting
wrongs in no time.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.485
All right, any luck on
the Sandstorm operative

03:01.529 --> 03:04.140
Dolan made
contact with?

03:04.184 --> 03:07.230
Why should I trust you?Because I am telling you
how to get away right now.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.232
That's the thing.
I don't know who's left.

03:09.276 --> 03:12.670
Every other Sandstorm member
is either dead or in prison.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.891
I was able to further
triangulate the signals
from Dolan's phone, though.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.807
It looks like he had
a rendezvous in Brooklyn

03:18.850 --> 03:20.287
with someone
before he died.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.505
Yeah, possible our friend

03:21.549 --> 03:23.507
Mystery Question Mark Head
over here.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.336
We've been retracing Dolan's
steps using his phone

03:26.380 --> 03:30.906
and also combing through
CCTV and ATM camera footage.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.125
Hopefully we can find a face
to put inside that silhouette.

03:33.169 --> 03:36.041
But no luck yet We don't need luck.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.608
We just need
several technicians

03:37.652 --> 03:39.349
to sift through hundreds
of hours of footage.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.481
We'll get 'em.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.352
Whoever Dolan was
communicating with

03:42.396 --> 03:44.311
we need to find
before it's too late.Weller's right.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.269
This could be the last
active Sandstorm member.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.015
Looks like
our little bon vivant

03:53.058 --> 03:55.278
has been gallivanting
through gay Pa-ree!

03:55.322 --> 03:56.845
What the hell are you
talking about?

03:56.888 --> 03:58.586
I got a lead on
what's-her-name.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.240
Zapata? I thought
Patterson was tracking her.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.719
Well, you know, we don't
really like labels.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.939
Sometimes we swap intel.
We have a very open,

04:03.982 --> 04:05.375
fluid, professional
relationship.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.943
I'm the work wife.All right, what'd you find?

04:07.986 --> 04:09.336
Off the tram in Zurich
that Patterson ID'd,

04:09.379 --> 04:11.207
I was able to track
Zapata to Paris,

04:11.251 --> 04:14.515
where I found
this traffic-cam footage.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.387
Oh, you're
not impressed yet?

04:17.431 --> 04:19.911
How 'bout now

04:19.955 --> 04:21.304
What the hell is Zapata
doing with her?

04:21.348 --> 04:24.742
Probably not
shopping for berets.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.788
Oh, this makes no sense.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.877
Unless it does. What if
the whole time we thought

04:28.920 --> 04:30.835
Tasha was eat-pray-loving
her way around the world,

04:30.879 --> 04:32.402
she was actually working
for the other guys?

04:32.446 --> 04:33.664
There's no way she'd
meet with Blake

04:33.708 --> 04:35.362
unless she was in
some type of duress.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.972
She could be in trouble.

04:37.015 --> 04:40.323
Or she's a super-secret
double agent for the CIA.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.585
Keep digging.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.152
See if you can track her
movements from Paris.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.719
Copy that.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.416
Oh, and Rich,
this is important.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.722
Keep this on the low.

04:47.765 --> 04:48.897
I can't have this
getting out

04:48.940 --> 04:50.202
before we
have any answers.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.987
To paraphrase The Go-Gos
and, later,

04:52.030 --> 04:54.598
Haylie and Hilary Duff,
my lips are sealed.

04:54.642 --> 04:57.688
Oh, Patterson needs us.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.995
I just got some
pretty grim news.

05:00.038 --> 05:03.433
A private jet crashed into
the Atlantic last night.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.783
It belonged to HCI Global.
More specifically,

05:05.827 --> 05:07.829
this was Blake Crawford's
plane.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.962
It departed from Paris
and was en route to New York.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.791
Uh, do we have confirmation
that Blake was on it?

05:13.835 --> 05:15.837
Reports are still sketchy,
but an airport employee

05:15.880 --> 05:18.143
confirmed that there were
several people onboard.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.145
So far, none of the bodies
have been recovered.

05:20.189 --> 05:23.671
What makes this interesting is
that in the wake of this news,

05:23.714 --> 05:25.412
board member Madeline Burke

05:25.455 --> 05:28.980
has stepped up as the new CEO
for HCI Global.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.634
What do we know
about her?

05:30.678 --> 05:33.376
She's the widow of
oil tycoon Silas Burke.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.335
She's also a fixture
on Page Six.

05:35.378 --> 05:37.380
She wore this killer gown
to the Met Ball last year.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.904
See, the way the ruching
on the plaque gets kind
of scooped down below...

05:39.948 --> 05:41.558
Anything else
besides the fact

05:41.602 --> 05:43.343
that she's rich
and knows how to dress?

05:43.386 --> 05:45.954
Not yet. Honestly, she's
kinda come out of nowhere.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.521
Let's get something on her.
This woman just inherited

05:47.564 --> 05:49.087
the biggest, baddest company
on the planet,

05:49.131 --> 05:50.611
and we know nothing
about her.

05:50.654 --> 05:51.916
Looks like we're not done

05:51.960 --> 05:53.570
with Jane's tattoos
just yet.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.093
All right,
let's get to it.

05:55.137 --> 05:58.009
Hey, I need you to track
down that flight manifest.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.620
I want to know every person
who was on that plane.

05:59.663 --> 06:00.838
Look, just because Zapata

06:00.882 --> 06:02.405
was with Blake in Paris,
that doesn't mean--

06:02.449 --> 06:03.580
Look, just do it.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.539
All right?Okay.

06:09.499 --> 06:12.502
You could hold the door
for me. Jeez.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.286
Oh, my God!

06:15.636 --> 06:16.593
What?

06:16.637 --> 06:17.986
Has that been here
the whole time?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.596
What are you
talking about?Oh, just the solve

06:19.640 --> 06:21.293
to a tattoo that happens
to be on this map

06:21.337 --> 06:23.644
that we look at
every single day.Which tattoo?

06:23.687 --> 06:24.906
Remember that one
that's kind of shaped

06:24.949 --> 06:26.386
like a cartoon baby shark

06:26.429 --> 06:27.952
that we cracked
from the Tokyo cache?

06:27.996 --> 06:29.519
Had all those patterns
and random numbers in it?

06:29.563 --> 06:30.955
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.Yeah, well...

06:30.999 --> 06:33.436
Look at the outline
for the Tasman Sea.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.568
It looks exactly the same.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.308
I don't know.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.441
Oh, my God!

06:38.485 --> 06:41.226
You're totally right.
How did we not see this?

06:41.270 --> 06:43.446
Well, in our defense, we did
just get the Tokyo cache.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.969
Huh.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.058
No, wait a second.
Something else is going on here.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.626
Oh, I've never noticed
this before.

06:49.670 --> 06:55.545
Yeah, the color and texture
of the stonework is different.

06:55.589 --> 06:56.981
Right?Yeah.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.200
You know what we need?
We need an expert.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.897
We need someone
from the art world.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.595
I have a contact
at the National Gallery.

07:01.638 --> 07:02.726
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.I'll reach out...

07:02.770 --> 07:04.728
Not some stuffy
museum mouse.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.338
We need someone
with some street cred.

07:06.382 --> 07:08.471
You know, maybe somebody
we've worked with before.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.908
Who in your
Rolodex of misfit toys
do you have in mind?

07:10.952 --> 07:13.433
Maybe Boston.Boston Arliss Crab?

07:13.476 --> 07:15.043
You want to use
this clue as an excuse

07:15.086 --> 07:16.305
to bring in
your exYou know what?

07:16.348 --> 07:18.089
Now that you're
suggesting it, I mean...

07:18.133 --> 07:19.917
He's under house arrest.Yeah. So, he's
just sitting around,

07:19.961 --> 07:21.528
waiting to be made useful.

07:21.571 --> 07:22.616
All personal opinions aside,

07:22.659 --> 07:24.052
he's a world class forger

07:24.095 --> 07:25.662
and his first love
is sculpting.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.359
He's is a conman
and a hacker,

07:27.403 --> 07:29.405
not to mention an
arrogant pain in the ass.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.886
Whose expertise could
crack this whole tattoo
case wide open!

07:31.929 --> 07:34.279
Are you willing to risk the
lives of thousands of people

07:34.323 --> 07:36.194
just to avoid working
with Boston again?

07:36.238 --> 07:39.589
Patterson?I'm thinking.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.504
Uh, I'm sorry.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.027
Is there a reason
you positioned the table

07:43.071 --> 07:45.552
so that there's a glare
directly on the screen or...

07:45.595 --> 07:47.205
Yeah, I like to be
inefficient.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.251
I find that it really
slows down my productivity.

07:49.294 --> 07:52.080
Oh, that's
how you do it.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.995
Hey, do you need anything?

07:54.038 --> 07:56.258
A sparkling water, maybe,
or a deep tissue massage?

07:56.301 --> 07:57.477
I know you've been
working really hard.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.043
You can have
anything you want.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.436
I mean, we have
this whole FBI lab

08:00.480 --> 08:02.133
and all these minions
at our disposal.

08:02.177 --> 08:03.483
Hey.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.485
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.008
I think I've just
figured it out.

08:07.051 --> 08:10.228
Seriously Yes!

08:11.665 --> 08:12.666
We got a lead?

08:12.709 --> 08:15.059
If by "we" you mean "me,"
then yes.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.671
I knew that New Zealand
fit into the solve somehow.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.760
Uh, technically,
we figured that out.

08:19.803 --> 08:23.415
Okay. So, using
my extensive knowledge

08:23.459 --> 08:25.505
of the stone inlay process
as well as my time

08:25.548 --> 08:27.289
spent apprenticing
for a cartographer...

08:27.332 --> 08:29.509
Hey, did I mention
I studied at Oxford?

08:29.552 --> 08:32.337
I left it off the CV
'cause it felt like bragging.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.513
Still does.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.124
You have done
something with your hair.

08:36.167 --> 08:39.823
Your whole vibe is edgier.
It's a triumph.

08:39.867 --> 08:42.609
Anyway, I realized
a secondary stone

08:42.652 --> 08:45.133
had been inlayed after
the initial sealing process.

08:45.176 --> 08:48.266
So, I did a small sample
analysis and it turns out

08:48.310 --> 08:50.573
it was actually a mineral--
magnetite.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.923
Which is the most magnetic
mineral found on earth,

08:52.967 --> 08:55.317
primarily in Hong Kong,
Tanzania,

08:55.360 --> 08:57.624
California, and New Zealand,
hence the tattoo.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.495
So, you think this magnetite

08:59.539 --> 09:01.758
is somehow a key
to solving this puzzle?

09:01.802 --> 09:04.935
No, I don't think.
I know. Come on, gang.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.507
Get ready for it.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.256
Huh. How...

09:22.344 --> 09:24.564
So, this whole wall
is magnetic?

09:24.607 --> 09:26.740
Not the entire wall--
just the areas where

09:26.783 --> 09:28.350
the metal filings
are clinging to it.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.091
As you can see,
the magnetic stones

09:30.134 --> 09:31.875
were strategically placed.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.617
It's some kind of code
based on magnetism.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.664
So, what, each cluster
represents a numerical value?

09:37.707 --> 09:39.361
Allow me.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.885
PatOkay.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.888

09:50.415 --> 09:52.592
8.5.Hey, what if we
add those numbers

09:52.635 --> 09:54.332
to the ones
in Jane's tattoo?

09:54.376 --> 09:56.030
It might...Get us a web address?

09:56.073 --> 09:58.075
Holy crap.
Weller for the win.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.730
It's a URL
for a strange website.

10:00.774 --> 10:01.905
Oh, you got one, Limpy!

10:01.949 --> 10:03.167
So, what does it say?

10:03.211 --> 10:05.996
"5434 Amherst Street,
Brooklyn."

10:06.040 --> 10:07.824
That's good work, Boston.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.652
We seriously couldn't
have done it without you.

10:09.696 --> 10:10.958
Uh, without "us,"
you mean.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.612
Right? I mean,
it was a group effort here.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.657
Well, yeah, but it was
his art expertise that--

10:14.701 --> 10:16.224
Cracked the case open,
which is why it's a good thing

10:16.267 --> 10:17.921
that I suggested
we bring him in, so...

10:17.965 --> 10:20.968
Uh, Ithought that you said
it was Patterson's idea.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.230
I was lying.All right.

10:22.273 --> 10:23.797
You think you can
stick around?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.363
Depending on how this case goes,
we might need you again.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.843
You mean not go back
to house arrest

10:26.887 --> 10:29.150
at my studio apartment
with no TV

10:29.193 --> 10:30.630

10:30.673 --> 10:32.109

10:32.153 --> 10:33.720
if it'll help America.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.547
So, I'll go and check out
that address with Jane.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.941
Uh, maybe Patterson
should go with you?

10:37.985 --> 10:40.161
I mean she is
the puzzle expert, right?

10:40.204 --> 10:41.945
Good thinking.
Patterson, go with Jane.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.860
Hang on.
I'll go with Patterson.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.470

to be in the field.

No, I don't want you going
zero to 100 real quick

10:47.559 --> 10:49.083
and having a setback,
and besides,

10:49.126 --> 10:51.259
I could use your expertise
on the HCI Global case.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.869
Don't be a hero.
We wouldn't want to

10:52.913 --> 10:54.305
lose you
on your first day back.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.229
Are you sure we got
the right address?

11:05.273 --> 11:08.102
It looks pretty
desolate in here.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.107
Hey, look at this.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.199
What's an ATM
doing in here?

11:18.242 --> 11:19.287
Hello.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.855
Oh, that's really creepy.

make a transaction?"

11:32.779 --> 11:33.823
Yes.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.308

Four rows of ten seashells,

11:46.880 --> 11:49.883
but one in each row
is slightly different.

11:49.926 --> 11:50.971
It's another puzzle.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.015
The sixth one
in the first row

11:52.059 --> 11:53.756
is the anomaly.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.106
The seventh in the second,

11:56.150 --> 11:58.413
the second
in the third row,

11:58.456 --> 12:00.502

Now, we have been
tasked to run

13:16.143 --> 13:18.885
a secret inter-agency
intel sharing program.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.235
Lack of inter-agency
communication

I have agents from

13:29.634 --> 13:33.247
Homeland Security,
all sharing and comparing data.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.206
Hmm. You gas them

13:36.250 --> 13:38.730
Why would they not feel
compelled

13:38.774 --> 13:40.080
to tell their superiors?

13:40.123 --> 13:41.951
Because they know that
the government is handcuffed

You were born
Madeline Rebecca Miles

14:56.025 --> 14:57.853
in San Francisco,
an only child.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.854
You come from a...

14:58.898 --> 14:59.942
...prominent family.

14:59.986 --> 15:00.987
Her father was a businessman

15:01.030 --> 15:01.988
with political aspirations,

15:02.031 --> 15:03.728
who disappeared
mysteriously.

Rumors abounded of the usual
rich people problems...

15:05.730 --> 15:08.255
gambling, drug abuse,
affairs...

15:08.298 --> 15:10.039
I dug up old school records,

15:10.083 --> 15:11.823
and Madeline, she graduated
at the top of her class

15:11.867 --> 15:14.957
from Stanford Medical School,
but she never practiced.

15:15.001 --> 15:18.047
She probably didn't need to

Burke's net worth

15:19.962 --> 15:21.964
was close to $2 billion
when he died last summer.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.923
Madeline spent most of her life
running charities

15:23.966 --> 15:25.794
for the Burke family.
She also has...

15:25.837 --> 15:27.013
...two grown sons
who live abroad,

15:27.056 --> 15:28.971
one in Brussels,
the other in Hong Kong.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.843
Neither have an interest
in the family business.

good job covering up

15:39.112 --> 15:42.289
the drunk driving incident
he had in college.

15:42.332 --> 15:45.988
I made sure the FBI would
never find any record of it.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.470
And finally, your loving
husband of 23 years

15:49.513 --> 15:51.167
died three months ago
of a sudden heart attack,

15:51.211 --> 15:54.127
leaving you to take over
his board seat at HCI Global.

passing, of course.

took his last breath,

16:15.104 --> 16:17.977

16:20.588 --> 16:22.938

pretending I love him

the dutiful wife,

16:24.200 --> 16:28.422
stop....
stop resenting him.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.859
Silas was a lazy misogynist

16:30.902 --> 16:34.254
who skated by on
the wealth he inherited.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.778
Never had to work
a day in his life,

16:36.821 --> 16:39.259

not really.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.090
it was the perfect
opportunity

16:44.133 --> 16:46.831

opportunity pass us by.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.145
Oh...

16:56.189 --> 16:58.278
I still remember
the day he died.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.280
He was reading his paper,
having a single slice

17:00.323 --> 17:02.978

as he did every morning.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.459

the sip of coffee...

17:15.991 --> 17:18.341
...I could taste
my freedom returning.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.136
My husband showed me more
feeling in his last moments

17:30.179 --> 17:32.138
than he had
in the last 20 years,

17:32.181 --> 17:35.141

death was the best thing

17:35.184 --> 17:36.925

on the board members,

17:39.928 --> 17:42.104

remarkable moment

drove us around in circles

19:41.223 --> 19:43.399
before dropping us off in
the middle of Prospect Park.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.661
What do we have
on Stack?

19:44.705 --> 19:46.010
Nothing. No record of him

19:46.054 --> 19:47.534
working at the NSA
or anywhere else.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.275
It kind of goes
with his whole M.O.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.973
of organizing a super
secret "intel sharing op."

19:52.016 --> 19:53.975
He mentioned being
part of Zero Division.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.759
Which doesn't
exist on the books.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.239
It's a good department
to claim you work for

19:57.283 --> 19:58.806
if you don't want
people looking into it.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.374
That was Nas.
She has no knowledge

20:01.417 --> 20:02.723
of Stack or of this group.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.465
So we can all agree
we can't verify anything.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.857
All right,
maybe none of it's true,

20:06.901 --> 20:09.164
but the fact remains, that
puzzle is in our building.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.907
Patterson's right. This tattoo's
on Jane's body for a reason.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.518
Roman knew about Stack
and this organization.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.216
He wanted us
to investigate it.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.913
There has to be something
that we haven't seen yet.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.523
The only thing
we could look into

20:20.567 --> 20:23.526
is the case file he
showed us, and it's legit.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.398
He definitely has
a source on the inside.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.964
What about the files
that he wanted?

20:27.008 --> 20:29.228
All three pertain
to cold cases.

20:29.271 --> 20:32.492
Nothing suggests
a connection to a terror plot.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.624
Wait a minute.
He's slow-playing us.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.845
You don't see this?
Think about it.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.195
He's grooming us,
appealing to our vanity

20:40.239 --> 20:42.415
with these puzzles and games,
showering us with compliments

20:42.458 --> 20:45.461
about how we're so smart,
not like the other dummy agents.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.289
And then, what, he asks for
something relatively innocuous,

20:47.333 --> 20:50.988
like cold case FBI files,
and then, before we know it,

20:51.032 --> 20:54.296
we're burning the
American flag and eating
borscht for breakfast.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.908
So, how do we figure out if
he's telling the truth
about any of this?

20:57.952 --> 21:01.260
We work backwards.
The one thing we
do know for sure,

21:01.303 --> 21:03.349
he is connected
to this map puzzle.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.525
Good thing we still
have Boston here.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.091
He's been
surprisingly helpful

21:07.135 --> 21:09.616
and marginally
less annoying.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.705
Let's loop him in.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.359
Are we sure
we wanna do that?

21:13.402 --> 21:15.056
You don't want to go with
somebody more above board?

21:15.099 --> 21:16.536
I know Patterson
has a great contact

21:16.579 --> 21:18.451
at the National Gallery.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.583
The map was created

21:20.627 --> 21:22.716
by American sculptor
Andrew Jackness,

21:22.759 --> 21:25.022
Professor of Art History
at Georgetown University

21:25.066 --> 21:28.504
for 20 years,
since back in 1985.

21:28.548 --> 21:29.810
How did his artwork
end up here?

21:29.853 --> 21:32.116
Our government commissioned him
back in 2005

21:32.160 --> 21:34.162
after an extensive search
of American sculptors.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.207
Not extensive enough,
if you ask me.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.339
Can we bring him in?

21:37.383 --> 21:39.907
Uh, we can, but it would
be super gross.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.125
He died a few years ago.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.649
The university
was a hotbed

21:42.692 --> 21:44.825
for Russian espionage
activity then.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.566
Several students
and even some faculty

21:46.609 --> 21:48.611
were suspected of becoming
spies for the motherland.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.004
Well, if Jackness
was a traitor,

21:50.047 --> 21:51.484
he could've put
the puzzle in the map.

21:51.527 --> 21:52.833
Stack mentioned that this

21:52.876 --> 21:54.748
was a multiagency op.So that means

21:54.791 --> 21:56.271
there's who knows
how many agents

21:56.315 --> 21:58.099
in all parts of
American government

21:58.142 --> 21:59.579
feeding intel
to the Russians.

21:59.622 --> 22:02.669
They could have access to
case files of known criminals,

22:02.712 --> 22:04.497
undercover ops,
CIA black sites,

22:04.540 --> 22:05.976
military secrets,
you name it.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.413
Dig deeper into Stack.
I want to know

22:07.456 --> 22:09.240
exactly who the hell
we're dealing with.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.464
It's not every day you get
poison gassed by an ATM.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.118
It might've been worth it
if this Stack guy

22:17.161 --> 22:19.512
has access to
black site locations.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.905
He could know where
Shepherd is being held.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.734
Sounds like it's time to
put theory into action.

22:24.778 --> 22:27.607
Are you sure
you're up for this?

22:29.173 --> 22:31.175
Try to stop me.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.569
♪♪

22:37.486 --> 22:38.922
What you got?

22:38.966 --> 22:41.751
We dug deeper into the artist,
Andrew Jackness.

22:41.795 --> 22:44.275
Take a look at this yearbook
photo from Georgetown.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.408
See this guy
in the background?
Looks a lot like Stack.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.193
We cross-referenced the photo
with Georgetown's ID database

22:49.237 --> 22:51.544
and we found a match to
a visiting professor that year.

22:51.587 --> 22:54.416
So, Stack came to Georgetown
impersonating a professor

22:54.460 --> 22:55.591
to get close to Jackness.

22:55.635 --> 22:57.114
Using Keaton's CIA database,

22:57.158 --> 22:59.726
we were able to figure out
Stack's real identity.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.597
Meet Boris Sokoloff,

23:01.641 --> 23:05.035
a former codebreaker for
the FSB, allegedly retired.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.428
You're sure that's
the guy you met?

23:06.472 --> 23:07.560
It's definitely him.

23:07.603 --> 23:08.952
This timeline
matches up perfectly.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.432
He was commissioned
to make the sculpture

23:10.476 --> 23:11.651
for the FBI building
in 2005.

23:11.694 --> 23:13.435
Boris then
comes to Georgetown

23:13.479 --> 23:15.829
that same year
using a bogus identity,

23:15.872 --> 23:17.874
and either sweet-talks
or strong-arms Jackness

23:17.918 --> 23:19.615
into inserting the puzzle
into the sculpture.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.444
Now that we know his real
identity, we can dig deeper,

23:22.488 --> 23:24.751
find out where exactly
he's been funneling this intel.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.492
Rich, you might
want to be careful.

23:26.535 --> 23:27.884
Your boy might be
taking your title

23:27.928 --> 23:29.625
as Most Valuable Criminal
around here.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.497
Call anytime.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.715
I'm just sittin'
in the apartment,

23:32.759 --> 23:33.803
looking at
the light blinking

23:33.847 --> 23:35.283
on my ankle monitor.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.633
Right?
'Cause it's just...

23:37.677 --> 23:39.069
Hey, you know what?
Speaking of which,

23:39.113 --> 23:41.507
why don't you go back there?
You know, I mean,

23:41.550 --> 23:42.638
it's been
a long day for you,

23:42.682 --> 23:43.596
just explaining things
over...

23:43.639 --> 23:44.684
You must be exhausted.

23:44.727 --> 23:45.946
We got it from here.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.252
No! He definitely
needs to stay.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.733
This guy is like
a lucky rabbit's foot.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.431
Boom.Pkhh!

23:53.867 --> 23:56.347
She's great.Mm-hmm.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.356
I emptied the bullets.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.664
Same with the second gun
you keep in the pantry.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.624
Hid your kitchen knives, too.
I would just have a seat.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.277
I assume you know who I am.

24:13.321 --> 24:18.282
Special Agent Zapata.
Is this another FBI witch hunt?

24:18.326 --> 24:19.849
I don't work for
that company anymore.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.634
I'm with
Madeline Burke now.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.377
She's right outside
in the car,

24:26.421 --> 24:28.728
but I would suggest
dealing with me.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.120
I'm nicer.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.601
What do you want?I want the copy

24:32.645 --> 24:34.516
of Hank Crawford's
personal hard drive

24:34.560 --> 24:37.084
that you keep in your safe,
and every dirty little

24:37.127 --> 24:40.522
HCI Global secret
he kept on it.

24:40.566 --> 24:41.871
What do you say?

24:42.785 --> 24:45.179
Please just don't hurt me.

24:45.222 --> 24:48.356
Give me the hard drive
and I won't have to.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.928
It turns out Boris has
an interesting back-story.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.582
Boris's wife
and young daughter

24:56.625 --> 24:58.627
defected to the US
back in 2000,

24:58.671 --> 25:00.194
and the CIA helped them.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.804
The US government
staged an explosion

25:01.848 --> 25:03.545
to extract Boris's wife
and daughter

25:03.589 --> 25:07.549
in exchange for intel on Boris
and his FSB spy activities.

25:07.593 --> 25:10.030
So, as far as Boris knows,
his family died

25:10.073 --> 25:11.727
in a freak accident
20 years ago.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.599
He has no idea they
were given new identities

25:13.642 --> 25:16.602
and are living comfortably in
Tucson under CIA protection.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.779
So, Boris thought he lost
his family, then doubled down

25:19.822 --> 25:20.736
on his work for the FSB.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.912
The FSB must have
made the plan

25:22.956 --> 25:24.566
to use puzzles
to lure agents.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.350
If this has been going on
since the mid-2000s,

25:26.394 --> 25:27.917
that means they've gathered
over a decade's worth

25:27.961 --> 25:29.702
of intel
from various agencies.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.269
We gotta stop
this leak now.

25:32.313 --> 25:35.577
The only way to get Boris
is to play along.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.754
Patterson and I need to go back
in with the FBI files he wants.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.147
We'll stake out
the meeting,

25:40.190 --> 25:41.583
we'll take him down before
he can gas you again.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.367
Look, all due respect,
but that's exactly

25:43.411 --> 25:45.021
what we shouldn't do.
As far as we know,

25:45.065 --> 25:46.632
Boris is just
the tip of the iceberg.

25:46.675 --> 25:48.590
So, you want to send
Jane and Patterson

25:48.634 --> 25:50.940
into a situation where
they're gonna be poisoned,

25:50.984 --> 25:53.073
stripped of
their weapons, phones,

25:53.116 --> 25:54.988
any tracking device--
how is that a safe plan?

25:55.031 --> 25:57.381
Boris wants to use them,
not hurt them.

25:57.425 --> 25:59.122
He's not gonna harm
Jane or Patterson

25:59.166 --> 26:00.950
unless he feels
he's being tracked.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.736
I-I'm with Keaton on this one.
I hear what you're saying,

26:03.779 --> 26:06.260
but I think we
should treat this like
a fact-finding mission.

26:06.303 --> 26:07.827
If we get caught
trying to track Boris,

26:07.870 --> 26:08.915
we could risk
the whole op.

26:08.958 --> 26:11.657
Once the lab
IDs the gas Boris used,

26:11.700 --> 26:12.745
I can create an antidote.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.790
If Jane and I
can stay conscious,

26:14.834 --> 26:16.836
we can figure out
where Boris moves us

26:16.879 --> 26:18.577
and where his servers are.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.795
All right. Let us know
the minute you have it.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.362
Our six-hour window
is closing fast.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.974
Oh, hey, guys!
Before you go, warm scone?

26:25.018 --> 26:27.324
I'm not about to
say no to a warm scone.

26:27.368 --> 26:28.499
Hmm.

26:28.543 --> 26:29.849
That's great. Thanks.No problem. Enjoy.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.894
Thank you.Good luck out there.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.940
Why don't you ever
bring us snacks?

26:48.607 --> 26:49.738
It's all here.

26:49.782 --> 26:51.740
Crawford's hard drive,
all his old files.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.655
I know you think
you're letting him down,

26:53.699 --> 26:56.615
but you're not...
you're adapting.

26:56.658 --> 26:57.920
You take care.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.663
This is not a good idea.

27:04.448 --> 27:07.103
I always knew you had
your eye on Crawford's chair.

27:07.147 --> 27:10.585
I doubt that.
But it sounds nice.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.066
Your husband may have
underestimated you.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.024
I never did...
I was wondering

27:15.068 --> 27:16.896
when you were gonna
make your move.

27:16.939 --> 27:19.028
You're a smart woman.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.814
It's a shame you're loyal
to a dead man.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.688
I thought you wanted me
to take care of this.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.691
I do! Clean it up.

27:31.867 --> 27:34.740
♪♪

27:38.700 --> 27:41.007
♪♪

27:41.050 --> 27:43.139
Got the tox screen
results back.

27:43.183 --> 27:46.273
Boris knocked us out using
a gas called halothane.

27:46.316 --> 27:47.491
It's a potent anesthetic.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.102
Is there a way
to nullify it?

27:49.145 --> 27:52.583
Yes. The gas targets GABA
receptors in the brain,

27:52.627 --> 27:54.673
so I'm having our med team
synthesize a pill

27:54.716 --> 27:56.544
that should block them.
It's getting to my lab now.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.198
I reviewed the case files
Boris wants.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.895
Rich is right,
they seem pretty innocuous,

27:59.939 --> 28:01.201
but I am not
happy about giving up

28:01.244 --> 28:03.551
any FBI files
to a known Russian spy.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.292
Why don't I forge them?
If you recall,

28:05.335 --> 28:06.641
that is one
of my special skills.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.730
Why would we forge
FBI documents?

28:08.774 --> 28:10.863
We... are FBI.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.821
It could be a test. We should
probably send the real deal.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.388
We can't risk alerting Boris

28:14.431 --> 28:16.477
anything funny is happening
at this stage of the game.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.957
He's gotta be using
that real intel for good.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.263
There's no way he could
have that information

28:20.307 --> 28:21.482
without all the other agents

28:21.525 --> 28:22.788
getting suspicious
over the years.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.137
Oh, I'm sure he uses it,

40:42.744 --> 40:45.747
Right, one with
flexible moral boundaries.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.401
Got anyone in mind?

40:47.445 --> 40:49.882
Yeah. He just needs
a little push.

40:49.925 --> 40:52.450
One of your specialties.
But we'll have to move fast.

40:52.493 --> 40:54.756
Once your little FBI friends
realize that Boris

40:54.800 --> 40:57.411
leaked black site
locations, they will
start to move prisoners.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.369
We've got to get to Shepherd
before that happens.

40:59.413 --> 41:01.371
Well, that's not
the only clock on this.

41:01.415 --> 41:05.419
Patterson is still
hell-bent on finding
Dolan's mystery contact.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.814
It's only a matter of
time until she figures
out it was me.

41:10.032 --> 41:12.948
Potassium...
chloride... hypotonic.

41:14.341 --> 41:15.777
That's quite
the cocktail, sis.

41:15.821 --> 41:17.387
It's just a precaution.

41:17.431 --> 41:19.085
Now that Weller's back
out in the field,

41:19.128 --> 41:21.653
I'll be spending days
andnights with him,

41:21.696 --> 41:24.743
and it'll be hard keeping
up the Jane Doe act.

41:24.786 --> 41:26.701
He's starting
to see cracks.

41:26.745 --> 41:28.398
So that's your Plan B.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.705
Get rid of Weller so
you can stay in the FBI

41:30.749 --> 41:31.663
as long as you can.

41:31.706 --> 41:33.708
Not a bad plan...

41:33.752 --> 41:37.320
I mean, if you can
actually do it.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.410
What is that
supposed to mean?

41:40.454 --> 41:43.501
Are you really prepared to
use that if it comes to it?

41:43.544 --> 41:47.548
Of course I am. I despise
everything he stands for.

41:48.767 --> 41:51.204
Hey! Honey...

41:51.247 --> 41:52.640
I know that I said
I'd go shopping,

41:52.684 --> 41:55.904
but then I thought,
why cook when we could go out?

41:58.254 --> 42:00.605
You okay?

42:00.648 --> 42:02.432
Yes, I'm fine.

42:02.476 --> 42:04.522
What are you hiding
behind your back?

42:07.612 --> 42:09.178
This is it.

42:09.222 --> 42:11.616
He knows.

42:11.659 --> 42:12.704
Kill him.
