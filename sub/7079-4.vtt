WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.753
"Always scare, Daniel-san."

00:03.045 --> 00:04.546
"Miyagi hate fighting."

00:06.048 --> 00:07.508
"Miyagi hate fighting."

00:08.050 --> 00:09.176
Line?

00:09.468 --> 00:11.108
"Yeah, but you like
karate." Right, right.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.096
Yeah, but you
like karate, though.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.556
So?

00:14.848 --> 00:15.849
Line?

00:16.140 --> 00:17.684
Chang, the audition's at 3:00.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.895
Well, maybe I shouldn't go.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.414
You know, maybe I'm a bad actor.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.190
Being good is
a fraction of acting.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.026
It takes discipline
and confidence!

00:26.318 --> 00:27.819
Discipline, confidence.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.863
Okay, from the top.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.075
"Always scare, Daniel-san.
Miyagi hate fighting."

00:33.367 --> 00:34.535
Line.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.869
I heard Karate Kid quotes.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.372
Chang is auditioning
for a stage adaptation

00:38.664 --> 00:39.998
of Karate Kid downtown.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.626
Yeah, and it's for the part
of Daniel LaRusso.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.378
You got a problem
with that, racist?

00:44.670 --> 00:45.963
No. You're acting now?

00:46.255 --> 00:48.382
Yeah, um,
you got a problem with that?

00:48.674 --> 00:50.008
I'm clear.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.511
They took my snake, and
they turned it into a plumber.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.304
They made the eggs into barrels.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.516
The pine tree they made into a
gorilla, but I recognize my design.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.726
Donkey Kong, my ass.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.395
That's Construction Snake.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.887
I don't practice law anymore.
But we have a case, right?

01:04.105 --> 01:06.567
Isn't everyone
you'd be suing dead?

01:06.858 --> 01:08.151
That's not cool, man.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.963
Why would a tree
throw eggs at a snake?

01:10.237 --> 01:11.673
Why would a plumber
be fighting a monkey?

01:11.697 --> 01:13.282
I don't know. I don't know.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.950
The Wi-Fi is still broken.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.522
What happened to "good morning"?

01:16.618 --> 01:18.138
- It's a bad morning, no Wi-Fi.
- Yeah.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.370
We really need Wi-Fi.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.124
Okay, let's not get carried away.
We need oxygen.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.210
We have oxygen. We need Wi-Fi.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.005
Wi-Fi!

01:29.131 --> 01:30.591
Okay! Okay, enough!

01:30.882 --> 01:32.342
Okay, look, what I'm doing.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.177
Look, "fix."

01:34.761 --> 01:36.471
"Wi-Fi."

01:36.763 --> 01:37.763
Hmm, okay.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.725
Boom and boom.

01:40.017 --> 01:43.645
All right, I am trying
to find the IT lady.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.440
My emails to her get bounced
back to me in Aramaic,

01:46.732 --> 01:49.234
and when I call, I hear an
undulating, high-pitched whistle

01:49.526 --> 01:50.526
that makes my nose bleed.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.613
Well, sounds like a bad IT lady,

01:52.904 --> 01:54.573
Right? Frankie,
hire a new IT lady.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.145
I'm pretty handy
with technology.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.521
I'm assuming
it's still the same,

01:57.618 --> 01:58.744
smaller holes, more bytes?

01:59.036 --> 02:00.156
What are we up to now, mega?

02:00.245 --> 02:02.080
Tera. Tera.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.585
They did it, those bastards.
They finally did it.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.003
Frankie, hire Elroy.
Elroy, you're the IT lady.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.776
Can I be his assistant?
Not for money.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.966
Can I be his friend? Elroy,
Abed is your friend.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.094
Now, the real reason I came by.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.763
I'm dying.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.808
Not really, but imagine how bad

02:22.100 --> 02:23.780
you'd feel for complaining
about the Wi-Fi.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.229
Here's the real reason.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.564
Too short?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.108
It is too short?

02:32.277 --> 02:35.572
It's not too short?

Awesome! Awesome.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.215
One more thing,

03:35.507 --> 03:38.677
you're, uh, gay, right?

03:38.969 --> 03:41.888
I mean, like, openly gay?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.391
Uh, I'm not openly anything,

03:44.683 --> 03:46.643
and gay doesn't begin
to cover it. No.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.895
Oh.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.605
Oh, I get it.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.816
This is about the uproar
over you guys

03:53.108 --> 03:55.360
canceling the Pride Parade
for a School Board Parade.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.946
Those guys get to dress
fancy all year!

03:58.238 --> 03:59.518
We have one day to...
No, no, no.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.241
No, this isn't about that.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.536
This is about adding
a new face to the board.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.289
But if that new face
happened to be openly gay,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.791
it would be because
we're so tolerant.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.126
And always were.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.837
But that's for us to deal with.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.380
The question you have to ask is,

04:16.673 --> 04:17.923
am I openly gay?

04:18.216 --> 04:21.136
Because if you are, that
gayness could be a rocket

04:21.428 --> 04:23.180
thrusting you
to new gay heights.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.348
And if you're not, well,

04:25.640 --> 04:28.727
there's a lot
of gay guys out there.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.938
I assume that's a selling
point of the lifestyle.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.150
You know, I... I never
thought about it that way.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.651
Well, I have.

What... what's going on?
What's going on?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.911
There's a bird's nest
in there with babies in it.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.454
The mother must have built it
there because of the heat.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.414
The same reason my mom took
my half brother to Arizona.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.832
That's probably why
the Wi-Fi is down.

05:14.856 --> 05:15.856
We'll have to move it.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.585
If you move them,
the mother won't come back.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.737
Those birds aren't
the new IT lady, I am.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.405
I'll move it carefully.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.990
The mother won't come back.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.576
Kid,

05:26.868 --> 05:29.188
animals have been murdering
each other for 3 billion years.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.414
Birds have had their 15
million in the spotlight,

05:31.706 --> 05:33.083
the same as lizards and plants.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.252
And they all just use it
to murder, eat, screw,

05:35.544 --> 05:37.170
and not invent Wi-Fi.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.172
Now, we may end up
saving this world

05:39.464 --> 05:41.132
or blowing it to hell
or making a new one,

05:41.424 --> 05:43.802
but we can't do any of it while
scheduling our evolution

05:44.094 --> 05:46.179
around the needs
of the least lucky birds.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.892
What are you, a demon?
Did Clive Barker write you?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.187
Anyone who finds that nest will
come to the same decision.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.814
And you don't have to get mean.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.816
Mean?

05:58.108 --> 06:00.360
You just did a baby bird
murder monologue.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.212
Maybe they're close
to leaving the nest.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.465
Until then, can't you just stall
by doing what real IT people do?

06:04.489 --> 06:05.782
What's that? Exactly.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.371
I've got one year
to make it all work.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.498
And that's what I'm
gonna do, make it work.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.790
All of it.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.835
This place is intimidating.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.420
You're gonna do great.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.798
Next up, Ben Chang for
the role of Daniel LaRusso.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.345
Thank you.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.931
"Daniel-san,
why you want learn karate?"

06:30.223 --> 06:31.659
Hang on a second.
Sorry, I can do better.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.519
Zip it. Who are you?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.938
Oh, I'm Annie,
a friend of Chang's.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.310
You mind coming up here
and reading with your friend?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.278
Okay, if it helps.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.328
Um...

06:52.704 --> 06:55.040
Daniel-san, why you want...

06:55.332 --> 06:56.499
Okay. Oh, sorry. No.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.044
You read Daniel-san.
You read Miyagi.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.545
Um...

07:00.837 --> 07:03.298
We'll do scene
seven, Miyagi's office.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.728
Are you the repairman?

07:17.020 --> 07:18.104
Aye.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.774
Our faucet's really leaking there.
Aye.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.360
When you gonna fix it?

07:23.652 --> 07:26.237
After. After what?

07:27.572 --> 07:28.698
After after.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.868
Tell everyone else to go home.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.244
We got the parts!

07:35.372 --> 07:36.539
Parts plural?

07:36.831 --> 07:39.918
Well, yeah, Annie got my part,
and I got the Asian part.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.711
Chang, stop!

07:42.003 --> 07:45.382
We were cast as Mr. Miyagi
and the Karate Kid

07:45.674 --> 07:47.175
because we're a good team.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.307
We're a team, because one
of us is so talented,

07:49.511 --> 07:51.221
she got cast outside her gender

07:51.513 --> 07:54.140
and the other one got cast
because of eye shape.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.602
I am not letting you
sabotage yourself like this.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.895
Let's say you're right,

07:59.187 --> 08:02.148
and like Sidney Poitier
or Meg Ryan before you,

08:02.440 --> 08:04.109
you were cast for race.

08:04.401 --> 08:09.406
It's what the actor does with the role
they get that matters, all right?

08:09.698 --> 08:10.698
You're right.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.077
All right, IT lady, how goes it?

08:14.369 --> 08:15.996
I found your problem. And?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.626
I'll need a little time
to fix it.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.712
Wow, need time to fix it.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.880
You sound just like
you work in IT.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.465
I've got some interesting news.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.051
The school board
offered me a position.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.845
Ooh, great.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.136
Congratulations.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.931
Well, I got a part in a play,

08:35.222 --> 08:36.743
and we were sort of
talking about that,

08:36.808 --> 08:38.559
so read the room, Pelton.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.602
Are you gonna take the job?

08:40.895 --> 08:41.895
I don't know.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.066
There's a catch.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.902
Jeffrey, Frankie, could I
see you in my office, please?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.865
They want you to be
a token homosexual?

08:52.157 --> 08:53.992
It's a form of progress.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.577
Thirty years ago, the most power

08:55.869 --> 08:57.954
the openly gay could achieve
was the center square.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.331
But I'm not just gay.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.624
What does that mean?

09:01.916 --> 09:03.668
If coming out is a magic show

09:03.960 --> 09:05.712
and gayness is
a rabbit out of a hat,

09:06.004 --> 09:08.882
I'm one of those
never-ending handkerchiefs.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.634
The sad truth, Craig,

09:11.926 --> 09:13.595
anything other than straight

09:13.887 --> 09:15.764
is plenty gay
for a school board.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.223
The most important point is,

09:17.515 --> 09:20.018
are you prepared
to make your sexuality,

09:20.310 --> 09:22.228
which is nobody's business,

09:22.520 --> 09:25.774
an aspect of your role
in society?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.442
I know I'm not, so I don't.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.611
Oh.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.323
When a person becomes symbolic,
they gain symbolic power

09:33.615 --> 09:36.242
at the price
of independent power.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.328
Yep, that's an excellent point.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.371
It could be good for Greendale

09:40.663 --> 09:42.665
for one of our own
to be on the school board.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.477
I mean, the fact that you'd
be leaving a few items

09:44.501 --> 09:46.377
off your list of turn-ons,
I mean...

09:46.669 --> 09:49.464
The goal in politics
isn't transparency.

09:49.756 --> 09:50.756
It's winning.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.467
That's why the politicians
always win.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.010
They do always win, don't they?

09:54.302 --> 09:55.502
But now I get a chance to win.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.097
I could change the system

09:57.388 --> 09:58.765
from the inside out.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.935
And all I have to do
is pare down my sexuality

10:02.227 --> 10:04.896
to simple gayness,
which is heavily in the mix.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.189
There you go.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.900
Get ready, America.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.610
Dean Pelton is coming out

10:10.902 --> 10:13.613
as approximately
two-sevenths of what he is.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.743
Come on, don't leave me hanging.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.621
There we go.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.042
I am so curious. Oh?

10:26.334 --> 10:28.002
Intellectually. Oh.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.839
All right, this is
a pretty basic scene.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.591
No real subtext. Let's just
get it up on its feet.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.385
There's no wrong answers, okay?

10:35.677 --> 10:36.845
Great, go.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.270
Hey, come fix faucet.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.235
Ooh, karate.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.279
Learn from book? Yeah.

10:54.571 --> 10:58.116
And a few classes back at the
Y in Jersey, where I'm from.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.492
What happen eye?

10:59.784 --> 11:01.619
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.788
I guess there are wrong answers.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.320
- Quick adjustment, Ben.
- Yeah.

11:05.415 --> 11:08.459
Act better. Act better. Thanks.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.951
Annie, you're doing great.
Keep doing what you're doing.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.463
Oh. Can I ask about
my motivation?

11:12.755 --> 11:14.632
Keep me from puking
is your motivation.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.302
Stop making me want to quit
the theater and kill myself.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.387
Go, after "what happen eye?"

11:20.388 --> 11:22.390
Okay.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.809
Hey, I fell off my bike.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.478
Hmm. Lucky no hurt hand.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.440
Okay. Can I see this toolbox?

11:32.609 --> 11:35.195
Ah, great. This is good. Got it.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.533
I got distracted
'cause the tools

11:40.825 --> 11:42.827
were doing a better job
than you.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.538
"What happen eye?" Say it!

11:45.830 --> 11:47.832
What happen eye? Liar!

11:48.124 --> 11:49.959
Stop lying to me. Say it!

11:50.251 --> 11:53.296
What happen eye?
What happen actor?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.965
You crying?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.134
You cry when I tell you to cry.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.720
So reabsorb that
disgusting droplet of salt

12:01.012 --> 12:02.805
and bad choices
back into your doughy body

12:03.097 --> 12:04.390
and then call your mother

12:04.682 --> 12:06.869
to see if you can be reabsorbed
back into her doughy body,

12:06.893 --> 12:08.493
or so help me God,
I will take that tear,

12:08.561 --> 12:10.813
I will freeze it, and I will
stab you in the eye with it,

12:11.105 --> 12:14.108
you waste of a soul-shaped
hole forgotten by God.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.613
Okay. What should I...

12:18.905 --> 12:20.549
Annie, don't change a thing.
You're prefect.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.242
Unless you want to.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.952
Okay.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.543
All right. I'm Rich Countee.
This is my man Carl.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.879
We work on the school board.
Yeah, we do!

12:35.171 --> 12:36.531
We have some
exciting news for you.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.260
Your own Dean Craig Pelton
has been selected

12:40.551 --> 12:43.304
to join the board of
Colorado Community Colleges.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.348
I'll just go... Go ahead, Dean.

12:45.640 --> 12:46.641
Talk.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.644
Hello, Greendale.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.813
As you know, this is
something I've wanted

12:52.105 --> 12:54.190
for a very long time.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.693
And I wanted to thank
all the people at Greendale

12:56.985 --> 12:58.065
that helped me achieve this

12:58.278 --> 13:01.948
and my partner, Domingo.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.367
Very proud of my Craig.
Aw, that's...

13:04.659 --> 13:06.786
Oh.

13:07.078 --> 13:10.123
And now, let's open it up
to some questions.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.415
As a gay dean,

13:11.666 --> 13:13.626
what is your opinion about
the recent controversy

13:13.918 --> 13:15.503
surrounding the canceled
Pride Parade?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.835
And do you think you were
selected to join the board

13:17.964 --> 13:19.324
because of your
sexual preferences?

13:19.590 --> 13:21.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I would just like to say

13:21.301 --> 13:24.053
that we are very proud to have Mr.
Pelton on the board,

13:24.345 --> 13:26.014
whatever his lifestyle may be.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.057
Which happens to be gay,

13:28.349 --> 13:30.184
which is great but irrelevant.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.937
It's doesn't...
Hey, it gets better!

13:36.482 --> 13:38.443
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, good.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.195
We're so happy.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.031
I feel like scum.
Gay people are scum?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.883
Okay, don't play that
card with me, young man.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.868
I make gayness look like
Mormonism, okay?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.480
I don't like being
this dishonest.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.663
Dean, I want to say
thanks for doing this.

13:50.955 --> 13:51.955
I never knew.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.875
I mean, people talk,
but I wasn't sure.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.312
Well, it really doesn't have
anything to do with my work.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.379
Yeah, but it's helpful
to me, you know?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.257
And to a lot of us,
so thank you.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.264
Hmm.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.975
Confine yourself
to your role, Domingo.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.560

I'm not gonna hit you,

15:08.741 --> 15:11.160
I don't hit water

or the air after a fart
has dissipated,

15:14.122 --> 15:16.874

15:17.166 --> 15:19.335
You are the worst actor
I've ever directed!

15:19.627 --> 15:22.130
And I directed both Wahlbergs!

15:22.422 --> 15:23.464
From the top!

15:23.756 --> 15:25.466
Danny does a bit
with the floor sanders!

15:25.758 --> 15:26.759
Miyagi is amused!

15:27.051 --> 15:28.051
And Kenny gets me another

He's so mean to Chang.
I don't know what to do.

You could just
drop out of the play.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.070
Well, you know, I could,

15:46.362 --> 15:47.989
or Chang could.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.783
I mean, the director's
not being mean to me.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.577
But you talked Chang
into auditioning,

15:52.869 --> 15:56.247
and then you got his part,
and now he's suffering.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.249
You're right.
I should threaten to quit.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.625
Or just quit.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.252
Well, if I threaten to quit,

16:01.544 --> 16:03.744
maybe that will be enough for
him to stop abusing Chang.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.050
I was kind of
born to act, Britta.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.427
When I do it,

16:09.719 --> 16:12.180
I can feel it
pleasing the universe.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.100
That's dramatic.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.852
See?

16:23.858 --> 16:25.335
The internet says
if they're sparrows,

16:25.359 --> 16:26.670
they'll be flying
in less than 12 days.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.571
If they're albatrosses,
we're in trouble.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.285
Albatrosses have
a 270-day fledging period.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.106
Thanks for guarding
the nest with me.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.422
Uh-oh.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.508
This is what you do
when you're working?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.593
Must be nice.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.012
All right, look, there's a
bird's nest in the router.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.764
If you want to fire me, fire me.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.558
Either way,
until those birds are gone,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.602
nobody gets any closer.

17:00.728 --> 17:01.896
Well, of course not.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.106
If you move them,
the mother won't come back.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.900
Keep up the good work.

17:08.611 --> 17:09.819
Hmm.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.742
Show me wax on.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.869
This is the worst acting
I've ever seen in my life.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.040
Show me wax off.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.126
The ghost of your father
just turned his back on you.

17:24.417 --> 17:27.088
Your ancestors
are clawing their way

17:27.380 --> 17:29.298
deeper into the earth
to get away from you.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.467
You make me embarrassed
to have thumbs.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.594
I can see air quotes around you.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.472
Show me paint fence.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.516
Knock, knock, knock.
Anybody home?

17:38.808 --> 17:40.728
Oh, look, there's nobody here.
Oh, it's so dusty.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.737
It's almost like nobody's
been here in years.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.063
There's a note.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.191
Never let me act!

17:47.483 --> 17:48.901
Mr. Lundergard, I'm sorry,

17:49.193 --> 17:51.195
but I cannot stand by
while you do this.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.780
That's fine. You can go.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.408
I'm not bluffing.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.369
You can't make an actor more
talented by yelling at them.

17:58.661 --> 17:59.787
And if you don't stop,

18:00.079 --> 18:01.831
your lead character
is gonna walk.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.415
Lead?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.502
You play Danny LaRusso.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.629
Well, I'm the Karate Kid.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.133
The Karate Kid
is about Kesuke Miyagi,

18:12.425 --> 18:14.302
an immigrant who fought
against his own people

18:14.594 --> 18:17.096
in World War II,
while his wife lost a child

18:17.388 --> 18:18.681
in an internment camp.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.141
Noriyuki Morita was nominated

18:20.433 --> 18:22.518
for an Academy Award
for his performance!

18:22.810 --> 18:25.479
Ralph Macchio showed up.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.024
I cast you because your
measurements allow me

18:28.316 --> 18:29.859
to use the same wardrobe
as last year.

18:30.151 --> 18:33.154
I cast Ben because he has
the sadness and talent

18:33.446 --> 18:34.989
that could make this show great

18:35.281 --> 18:38.492
if I have to physically
drill into his chest

18:38.784 --> 18:41.370
and suck it out with a straw!

18:41.662 --> 18:44.874
So you can take a flying
kick and a rolling doughnut.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.959
You're fired.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.878
But I'm talented too, right?

18:49.170 --> 18:50.921
What? No. Really?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.007
Really? Oh, my God.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.635
You're, like, doing a terrible
Vinnie Barbarino up here.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.471
But, like, I know you're not
capable of anything better,

18:58.763 --> 19:00.473
so that's why
I've been so nice to you.

19:00.765 --> 19:01.932
Take care, Annie.

19:02.933 --> 19:03.976
Yikes, right?

19:04.268 --> 19:05.686
Ooh, what a diva.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.983
Thanks for sticking up for me.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.860
No problem?

19:14.945 --> 19:17.865
From now on, she's dead to us.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.326
Hey, Gay Dean,
we've got a problem here.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.778
You reading the local papers?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.163
You've shut down
the campus Wi-Fi

19:24.455 --> 19:26.666
until a nest
of baby birds can grow?

19:26.957 --> 19:28.042
That's a little too gay.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.710
I didn't do it because I'm gay.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.087
Wait, I'm not gay.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.130
Oh! That did not
just get said to us.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.424
You are gay. You are openly
gay, and we love it.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.176
But now we're dealing
with more flak

19:37.468 --> 19:39.011
from conservatives
for appointing you

19:39.303 --> 19:41.722
than we ever did from gays
from not having one of you.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.183
Yeah, and the gays
aren't coming to your side.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.915
You know why?
Because the whole point

19:46.185 --> 19:47.603
is to get a job by being gay

19:47.895 --> 19:49.855
and then to do as good
a job as the normals.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.482
That's what the gays want.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.192
They don't want a gay dean

19:53.484 --> 19:55.069
who acts like
a weird gay monster.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.361
I'm not a gay dean.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.364
Whoa, not cool, man!

19:58.656 --> 20:00.324
Don't bring us
into your web of lies.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.119
Well, now what do you
want me to do?

20:03.411 --> 20:04.954
Figure it out, Gay Dean.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.706
Figure it out!

20:09.709 --> 20:12.002
Hey, Domingo. Hey, what's up?

20:15.756 --> 20:17.383
Guys, the school needs Wi-Fi,

20:17.675 --> 20:18.968
and my job is to run the school.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.429
The school doesn't need
baby birds.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.930
The nest needs to be moved.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.890
You are not crossing this line.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.892
I'm taping this.
This is on video.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.519
Guys.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.272
This is two white security guards
versus one unarmed black man

20:31.564 --> 20:33.607
and two baby birds.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.152
Your move.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.028
Stand down. Stand down!

20:38.320 --> 20:40.364
No security, no weapons,

20:40.656 --> 20:44.201
just one unarmed black man
versus one unarmed

20:44.493 --> 20:46.245
openly gay dean.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.542
Now, move that nest, please.

20:54.712 --> 20:55.963
Just a hair back, Domingo.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.299

breathing for me.

You are an inspiration.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.391
♪ Ahh ♪

22:01.278 --> 22:02.678
I have called
this press conference,

22:02.905 --> 22:05.991
because I have been less
than honest with the public.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.244
You know me
as the openly gay dean

22:08.536 --> 22:09.776
of Greendale Community College,

22:09.912 --> 22:12.456
but that doesn't even begin
to describe

22:12.748 --> 22:13.874
what I really am.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.918
I belong to one
of the most marginalized

22:16.210 --> 22:19.547
and least openly
honest groups in America.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.759
I am

22:25.094 --> 22:26.136
a politician.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.389
Now, what does that mean?

22:28.681 --> 22:31.058
Are politicians like you?
Well, we look like you.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.019
But we will say
and do whatever we have to

22:34.311 --> 22:36.605
in order to acquire
and keep our jobs.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.733
It means nothing I say

22:40.025 --> 22:43.654
and very few of the things
I think can be trusted.

22:46.407 --> 22:49.076
I am tired of being
in this particular closet,

22:49.368 --> 22:51.203
so I am coming out now.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.458
I only hope that you can accept

22:56.750 --> 22:59.545
an openly political person
on your board.

23:00.963 --> 23:04.300
If not, I understand.

23:05.843 --> 23:06.927
Thank you.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.396
It's just faster if I get
to my office this way.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.478
We don't need pictures of this.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.970
I can't believe the dean got
kicked off the school board

23:19.231 --> 23:20.774
just for admitting
he's political.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.944
Yeah, some groups take longer
than others to gain acceptance.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.947
We like our politicians in the
closet because we're afraid.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.241
Deep down, we're all
a little political.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.660
Any of you guys smell
a bird murderer?

23:31.952 --> 23:32.953
I came here to apologize.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.539
I hope your apology comes
with a beak and hollow bones

23:35.831 --> 23:38.208
and a special magnet in its
head it uses to migrate.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.085
You skipped wings.
Insects have wings!

23:40.377 --> 23:42.421
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Abed.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.299
I lost myself in a role.
It won't happen again.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.951
Two of them died.
There's one left.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.445
He's hanging on, but I'm worried

23:48.469 --> 23:50.309
he's turning into a symbol
of my own innocence.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.931
Aw.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.808
Isn't Chang's play tonight?

23:55.100 --> 23:57.561
If any of you go,
you're supporting abuse.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.271
Oh, dial it back, Annie. Oh!

23:59.563 --> 24:00.606
Well, I'm definitely in.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.667
It'll be interesting to see
how his fake crying

24:02.691 --> 24:03.877
is different
from his real crying.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.111
Well, I'm a big fan
of the performing arts,

24:06.403 --> 24:08.530
but I'll go to Chang's play
anyway.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.582
Karate Kid adaptation?
Karate Kid adaptation?

24:10.741 --> 24:12.385
Karate Kid adaptation?
Karate Kid adaptation?

24:12.409 --> 24:13.577
Karate Kid adaptation?

24:28.175 --> 24:29.593
Karate Kid adaptation? Okay.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.972
Ah, I'm coming. I'm catching up.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.770
Directors have a saying.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.398
Actors are worthless,

24:42.690 --> 24:44.483
empty-headed homunculi.

24:44.775 --> 24:48.612
But the right one
in the right role

24:48.904 --> 24:50.239
can change the world.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.534
I have found the right one.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.285
He's found the right role.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.914
And tonight, your world changes.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.374
You're welcome.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.642
He replaced me with Annie Kim?
Shh.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.937
Ow! Sorry. You okay?

25:23.522 --> 25:26.316
You must be the new people
in apartment 20.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.152
What was that? Karate?

25:28.444 --> 25:29.945
Yeah, you know.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.841
Hey, me and some of my friends are
gonna have a party at the beach later.

25:32.865 --> 25:33.949
You should come.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.910
Hey, are you the repairman?

25:37.202 --> 25:39.121
Aye. KIM: Faucet's
really leaking there.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.331
Aye.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.791
When are you gonna fix it?

25:43.083 --> 25:44.334
After.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.627
After what?

25:46.879 --> 25:47.921
After after.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.135
Come ask leave boy alone.
To train.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.345
You got a lot of nerve, old man.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.431
But I like that. I like that.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.308
Name a place.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.642
Tournament.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.565
"Sergeant Miyagi." Yes, sir.

26:06.857 --> 26:09.568
Regret to inform wife, sir!

26:13.405 --> 26:16.742
Complication at birth, sir.

26:18.994 --> 26:22.289
No doctor at camp.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.793
What she...

26:27.419 --> 26:28.629
What she do...

26:30.255 --> 26:32.049
Please forgive me. Shh.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.970
No need fight anymore.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.305
You proved point.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.183
What, that I can take a beating?

26:41.475 --> 26:43.977
Every time I see those guys,

26:44.269 --> 26:45.979
they'll know
they got the best of me.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.982
Close eye.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.834
Get up, Daniel.

27:07.918 --> 27:08.919
Get up.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.433
You're all right, LaRusso.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.396
We did it, Mr. Miyagi.
We did it!

27:33.569 --> 27:34.987
I'm speechless.

27:35.279 --> 27:37.322
- I forgot Chang was up there.
- Me too.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.408
It's such a relief
to be able to support him

27:39.700 --> 27:41.535
out of something
other than fear.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.471
I guess all that suffering
Chang endured paid off.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.557
It's not what the play suggests,
but you have to wonder

27:45.581 --> 27:47.809
if it wouldn't have been better for
Daniel to get beat up even more.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.251
I am at a total loss

27:49.543 --> 27:51.545
about what lesson I'll
learn from any of this.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.088
Maybe that's the lesson.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.548
Hmm.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.759
I lost a button. Maybe
we all lost a button.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.221
Hey. Hey, guys.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.642
- You were so wonderful.
- Thank you so much.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.394
Hey, thank you
for making me do this.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.813
You're welcome. Congratulations.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.192
I'm jealous.
Oh, no, no, don't be.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.843
Believe me, I sit in my dressing
room, and all I dream about

28:16.111 --> 28:18.197
is a white picket fence
and the dog.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.616
I don't have those either.

28:20.908 --> 28:23.076
Chang, let's go.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.038
I guess all the actors go to some
sort of actor bar together.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.570
So I'll see you guys in school.

28:27.789 --> 28:28.789
Bye.

28:36.757 --> 28:40.010
Hey, I know this great bar for
people that don't hate themselves.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.471
What do you say?

28:43.513 --> 28:45.015
Milady?

28:46.558 --> 28:48.185
Milord.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.316
We are gathered here today

28:54.608 --> 28:57.402
to celebrate the release
of this bird into these skies,

28:57.694 --> 28:58.934
that its now fully formed wings

28:59.071 --> 29:01.198
may find purchase
upon the four winds.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.650
If anyone would like to say
something, now is the time.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.413
Oh, uh, I'll always remember

29:08.705 --> 29:10.916
how you kept me
from getting email for a week.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.377
And that chirp you do
when you want more bread.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.254
Yeah, that one.

29:15.545 --> 29:18.105
And now, everyone, please put on
your cat masks and finger wings.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.180
With these cat masks,
we remind you

29:25.472 --> 29:27.152
that this place can
no longer be your home.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.017
But with the fluttering
of these wings,

29:29.309 --> 29:31.509
we symbolically join your
flight into the natural world.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.021
Wings, everyone.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.738
Okay, you can go now. Go.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.700
Time to go, little bird.
That's just the way it is.

29:51.665 --> 29:53.601
Then it's done. BRITTA: You
did the right thing, Abed.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.770
Thanks to you, that bird has his
whole bird life ahead of him

29:55.794 --> 29:59.214
to fly, meet lady birds, even start a
bird family. You made a difference.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.592
Aw. Abed.
