00:00.001 --> 00:03.702
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
CLAUDE:
<i> In a year I'll have an heir.</i>

00:03.704 --> 00:05.571
I'll never have to
be with Luc again.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.607
Leith, I won't fall in love
with him, I promise.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.642
CATHERINE:
Henri, this ambition

00:10.644 --> 00:14.046
that you carry endangers
not only you brother's life,

00:14.048 --> 00:15.280
but your own.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.449
Spain wants Henri on the throne

00:17.451 --> 00:19.685
and you do not have
the power to save Charles.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.322
HENRI:
<i> It's called</i> The Goetia,
<i> the book of black magic.</i>

00:23.324 --> 00:25.591
CATHERINE:
<i> And bestow my king with power</i>
<i> to conquer all enemies.</i>

00:25.593 --> 00:28.127
MARY: Bothwell, I know
we hardly know each other,

00:28.129 --> 00:31.530
but yet, here I am, asking you
to risk everything for me.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.599
With or without your crown,

00:33.601 --> 00:35.768
I would do anything for you.

00:35.770 --> 00:38.504
The threats you made
can never be taken back.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.571
We are finished.
DARNLEY:
Then, from now on,

00:39.573 --> 00:41.607
I will do nothing but drink

00:41.609 --> 00:43.142
and whore my way
through Scotland.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.710
Bothwell, arrest him.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.645
You can't arrest me.
All I have to do is

00:46.647 --> 00:48.580
say that that child isn't mine

00:48.582 --> 00:50.616
and you and your heir
will both pay the price.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.551
MARY: You would condemn
your own child?

00:52.553 --> 00:53.619
And who would believe you?

00:53.621 --> 00:56.255
Any man would.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.627
Dear Lord, we thank thee
for this humble offering...

01:01.629 --> 01:03.662
(rumbling)

01:03.664 --> 01:05.564
What's happening?
What's happening?

01:05.566 --> 01:08.500
DAUGHTER:
Father!
Under the table!
Under the table!

01:11.505 --> 01:13.839
No!
(screaming)

01:13.841 --> 01:16.842
Captioned by
 Media Access Group at WGBH 
access.wgbh.org

01:16.844 --> 01:20.646
MARY: The damage to the region
was devastating.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.714
Hundreds were pulled
from the rubble.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.416
The survivors are
gathering wherever they can,

01:24.418 --> 01:25.684
without food or shelter.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.586
It is a terrible tragedy.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.456
We must pray that God
has mercy on their souls.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.124
Indeed, Lord Ruthven.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.659
But they'll need more
than God's mercy.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.260
With winter coming,

01:35.262 --> 01:37.663
they need food, medicine
and shelter immediately.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.198
Not to mention
rebuilding the villages

01:39.200 --> 01:40.699
that have been destroyed.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.534
All of which costs money.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.270
And what are the finances
of Scotland to you?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.239
I thought you were some sort
of traveling merchant.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.408
David Rizzio is my advisor,

01:49.410 --> 01:52.411
and as a businessman from Turin,
he is an expert in accounting.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.113
Well, I don't know

01:54.115 --> 01:56.415
how they account for their money
in Turin, but in Scotland,

01:56.417 --> 01:58.884
a fund for catastrophic events

01:58.886 --> 02:02.521
has already been set aside
and managed by the Crown.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.491
But if the costs were to run
higher than expected,

02:05.493 --> 02:07.493
we had hoped that we could
count on the privy council

02:07.495 --> 02:09.461
for additional support.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.497
Surely you are not suggesting
that we take money

02:11.499 --> 02:13.665
from other
necessary expenses?

02:13.667 --> 02:15.167
Especially when
an emergency fund

02:15.169 --> 02:17.536
has already been established.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.239
Unless there has been
some mismanagement by the Crown?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.673
Of course not.
Because there are rumors

02:21.675 --> 02:24.176
that you struggle financially

02:24.178 --> 02:26.345
due to your expensive
Catholic wedding

02:26.347 --> 02:28.514
and your constant maneuvers
against England.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.315
If the privy council
were forced to pay

02:30.317 --> 02:32.584
for your mistakes...
They won't be.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.419
I look forward to reporting
on the relief effort

02:34.421 --> 02:36.221
at the next
privy council meeting.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.157
Thank you, Lord Ruthven.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.694
Lord Ruthven, uh,

02:42.696 --> 02:44.563
before you go,
I'd like to show you some...

02:44.565 --> 02:48.834
It appears your meeting
didn't go as planned.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.836
What went wrong?

02:50.838 --> 02:52.838
Did you ask Lord Ruthven
for money?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.740
Reverend Knox.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.608
Are you here to bring comfort
to the suffering,

02:56.610 --> 02:58.343
or merely bring
suffering to me?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.345
I came to preach the word of God
to these poor people

03:00.347 --> 03:01.747
in their time of need.

03:01.749 --> 03:05.350
This disaster is more than
an emergency for Scotland.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.486
It's an emergency for your rule.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.454
If you can't provide
for your people,

03:09.456 --> 03:11.790
it will expose your failures
as a leader.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.826
How can you call yourself
a man of God

03:14.828 --> 03:16.695
when you would use
the suffering of others

03:16.697 --> 03:18.297
to further your
political agenda?

03:18.299 --> 03:19.765
Letting you fall
is the best thing I can do

03:19.767 --> 03:21.200
for the people of Scotland.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.801
You scheme for power,

03:22.803 --> 03:24.870
you married a traitor...

03:24.872 --> 03:27.673
(chuckles) ...you even betrayed
your brother James,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.474
stripping him
of his land and title,

03:29.476 --> 03:31.510
and banishing him
to save yourself.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.445
You are responsible
for the deceit

03:33.447 --> 03:36.348
that led to James' involvement
in Lord Hamilton's death,

03:36.350 --> 03:37.816
and we both know it.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.284
No, you are responsible.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.519
For all of it.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.754
Now, either
you fail your people,

03:42.756 --> 03:44.823
or you ask the privy council
for extra funds

03:44.825 --> 03:46.225
and reveal your weakness.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.993
Either way,
you take one more step

03:47.995 --> 03:51.630
towards your eventual
removal from the throne.

03:55.236 --> 03:56.535
Looks like I win again.
(giggles)

03:56.537 --> 03:57.803
NICOLE
Straight through the heart.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.805
Just like Cupid's arrow.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.473
LUC: Well, I think
that we should get

04:01.475 --> 04:03.809
another turn,
Claude starts quivering

04:03.811 --> 04:05.477
every time I put
my arms around her.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.713
I do not.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.880
And even if I did,

04:08.882 --> 04:10.782
no one ever beats Charles.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.417
He's the best archer
in the family.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.654
We let him think so, anyway.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.423
I'm happy to prove myself
against you, Brother.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.891
It was a joke, Charles.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.593
Besides, I promised Mother

04:21.595 --> 04:23.629
I'd stop challenging
the king of France.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.430
Don't let my crown
get in the way.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.898
I know how much you want it.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.668
In fact,

04:29.670 --> 04:32.671
I'll wager you for it.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.640
If I shoot that apple
off your head, you bow to me.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.941
If I miss,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.309
the crown is yours.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.343
CLAUDE:
If you miss,

04:38.345 --> 04:39.811
Henri could be dead.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.446
One of us has to be.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.981
Your Majesty,
with all due respect...

04:42.983 --> 04:44.883
This is between
me and my brother!

04:51.959 --> 04:54.993
Maybe some other time.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.596
(Henri grunts, Nicole gasps)

04:57.598 --> 04:58.964
Charles!

04:58.966 --> 05:00.899
Henri, you all right?
CHARLES:
He's fine.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.601
But he's not the king.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.838
Nicole.
(quietly):
My love.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.507
Steady.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.449
GIDEON:
<i> The lords of the privy council</i>

05:17.451 --> 05:19.751
would like to throw a luncheon
for you and the archduke

05:19.753 --> 05:21.920
when he returns from Austria
with a marriage contract.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.856
Add it to my schedule,
Lord Blackburn.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.592
Jane, is my tea cold?

05:27.594 --> 05:29.928
I couldn't say, Your Majesty.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.898
Taste it and tell me.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.976
It's quite warm.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.611
Oh.

05:46.613 --> 05:47.846
Well,

05:47.848 --> 05:49.448
this one is ruined.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.417
Take it away and
have them bring me another.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.686
(cup rattles on plate)

05:57.391 --> 05:58.890
Elizabeth, you are safe.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.460
Your food is regularly
tested for poison.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.895
Perhaps I'd feel more relaxed
if my court

06:03.897 --> 06:05.931
were regularly tested
for traitors.

06:05.933 --> 06:09.534
I told you, a very small group
of Catholic nobles

06:09.536 --> 06:11.670
tried to engineer
an insurrection against you;

06:11.672 --> 06:13.972
they failed,
and they have been punished.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.974
Your subjects support you now
more than ever.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.877
Because I am providing them
with a Catholic king.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.748
An engagement you told me must
happen for my own protection.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.116
I know.

06:24.118 --> 06:26.151
This is difficult
for both of us.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.986
Could reassure you better

06:27.988 --> 06:30.822
if you let me
come to your chambers.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.057
How can I?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.892
I am about to become engaged.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.061
I must appear above reproach.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.562
Even with the archduke gone,

06:37.564 --> 06:38.997
all eyes at court are on me.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.400
I am surrounded by
false friends who either

06:41.402 --> 06:42.968
want to throw an engagement
party or have me killed.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.403
It's unbearable.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.938
Come away with me.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.508
Don't joke.
I'm serious.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.411
I have access to a remote
cottage up the coast.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.880
Slip away
and meet me there.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.582
I'm the queen of England,
Gideon.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.850
I can't slip away.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.519
Oh, just for a day or two.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.921
Make an excuse, say you need...

07:02.923 --> 07:06.992
a sabbatical for
secluded prayer and reflection.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.628
You cannot remain under this
cloud of fear and suspicion.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.696
If you stay here,

07:11.698 --> 07:13.165
the pressure of it
will drive you mad.

07:13.167 --> 07:16.001
Just as desire
will drive me mad

07:16.003 --> 07:18.470
if I can't touch more
than your hand.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.639
What part of me
were you thinking of touching?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.107
(knocks on door,
then door opens)

07:22.109 --> 07:23.608
(clears throat)

07:23.610 --> 07:25.477
Uh...

07:25.479 --> 07:27.946
Your request has been noted...
Mm-hmm.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.648
...Lord Blackburn.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.116
(door closes)

07:31.118 --> 07:33.118
See to the arrangements
immediately.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.121
Of course, Your Majesty.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.656
MARY:
<i> Inform the King Consort</i>

07:37.658 --> 07:39.124
<i> that his wife is here</i>
<i> to see him.</i>

07:39.126 --> 07:41.526
(Darnley whispers indistinctly,
woman laughs)

07:41.528 --> 07:42.861
WOMAN:
Mm.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.731
Ah, a visit from the queen.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.201
What an unexpected honor.

07:49.203 --> 07:52.671
Don't expect her to bow,
she's Russian.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.207
(whispering): Doesn't speak
a word of English.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.075
Probably doesn't know
who you are.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.844
Oh.

07:58.846 --> 08:02.714
What do you think
of her new necklace?

08:02.716 --> 08:05.750
It really brings out
her breasts, don't you think?

08:05.752 --> 08:08.220
I need to talk to you.
Alone.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.629
(Darnley sighs, woman giggles)

08:18.832 --> 08:20.632
MARY:
We agreed to maintain

08:20.634 --> 08:23.001
the image of a proper marriage.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.203
Everyone at court thinks you're
here managing your estate.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.838
Don't worry,

08:26.840 --> 08:29.741
I've kept my less savory
activities quiet.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.843
Not entirely.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.245
Lord Ruthven knows that<i> we</i>

08:33.247 --> 08:35.080
have been having
financial difficulties.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.915
I knew you were being
indulgent with your spending,

08:36.917 --> 08:39.017
but I didn't realize
how indulgent

08:39.019 --> 08:41.987
until I went to the treasury
to withdraw funds

08:41.989 --> 08:43.054
for the disaster victims.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.589
They informed me

08:44.591 --> 08:46.658
that you had taken that money,
as well.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.694
It's all<i> our</i> money now, darling.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.163
You tried to strip me
of everything I'm entitled to,

08:52.165 --> 08:54.533
so I have to take
what I can get.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.835
Because you want me to beg you
for the money back?

08:56.837 --> 08:59.070
No, "beg" is an ugly word,
I prefer "negotiate."

08:59.072 --> 09:01.106
There is nothing to negotiate!

09:01.108 --> 09:02.574
The disaster left
thousands homeless.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.243
You can't let
the Scottish people suffer

09:05.245 --> 09:06.945
to punish me.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.580
I need that money,
or whatever is left of it,

09:08.582 --> 09:09.848
to help the victims.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.050
Despite what you think of me,

09:12.052 --> 09:13.785
I'm not a monster.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.587
Of course I'll help you.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.156
I have the money right here.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.693
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.595
You can have it
on one condition.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.163
I want to come home to court.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.766
You can't want that
any more that I do.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.768
We hate each other.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.036
True.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.237
And you are with child,

09:32.239 --> 09:33.705
so marital relations
are out of the question.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.106
However, returning to court

09:35.108 --> 09:37.208
would give me something else:

09:37.210 --> 09:39.244
respect.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.247
People can't bow to a king
they don't see.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.783
I know you want to keep me
here to minimize me,

09:44.785 --> 09:46.117
but bring me home,

09:46.119 --> 09:47.919
an equal by your side,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.788
and you will have the money.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.758
Those are my terms.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.660
If you don't meet them,

09:55.662 --> 09:58.897
then you may as well
be murdering your own people.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.600
It's up to you, Mary.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.667
The fate of your nation
is in your hands.

10:12.212 --> 10:16.047
You're not seriously suggesting
we throw Darnley a party?

10:16.049 --> 10:18.049
It's what he wants.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.684
Recognition at my side

10:19.686 --> 10:21.319
as we announce the funding
for the relief effort.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.121
With so many lives
at stake,

10:23.123 --> 10:24.823
I have no choice but to
welcome him back to court

10:24.825 --> 10:26.391
with open arms.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.693
He doesn't belong
in the same room with you,

10:28.695 --> 10:29.661
much less at your side.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.213
There has to be
some other way.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.764
Mary and I already spoke
with Lord Ruthven.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.933
He made it very clear that if
the privy council finds out

10:34.935 --> 10:36.968
the funds have been mismanaged,
Mary will look weak.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.270
And I must appear strong
if I want the council's support

10:39.272 --> 10:40.805
when I move on England.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.173
But you can't actually trust him

10:42.175 --> 10:43.908
to keep his word
and give you the money.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.777
Oh, I don't.
But Darnley's ego

10:45.779 --> 10:47.278
has given us an opportunity.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.815
While he enjoys his victory
show with the nobles,

10:50.817 --> 10:53.084
his king's guards will be here
at court,

10:53.086 --> 10:54.819
leaving the Lennox estate
vulnerable.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.022
While Darnley's
distracted at the party,

10:57.024 --> 10:58.823
I could take some men
and retrieve the gold.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.092
The money belongs
to the Crown, David.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.961
If you were caught with it,
you'd be thrown in jail

11:02.963 --> 11:04.429
for robbery.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.364
I need to collect
the money myself.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.932
Well, I'm going with you.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.167
If it's Darnley's money, too,

11:09.169 --> 11:10.268
he may try to take it back.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.736
The money will be protected

11:11.738 --> 11:13.071
once we get it to the church.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.806
Father Quinn has agreed
to set up

11:14.808 --> 11:16.608
a charity fund in my name.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.409
It will provide
for the victims for now,

11:18.412 --> 11:20.278
and it will allow me
to protect my money

11:20.280 --> 11:21.980
from Darnley in the future.

11:21.982 --> 11:25.050
Darnley's already
provided a guest list.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.985
I'll send out the invitations.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.454
And I'll talk to the kitchen
staff about a menu.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.256
I believe roast pig
is appropriate

11:31.258 --> 11:32.991
for the occasion.
(Rizzio laughs)

11:34.895 --> 11:36.027
I don't like this.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.729
Even if it's
just for show,

11:37.731 --> 11:38.830
bringing Darnley back to court

11:38.832 --> 11:39.964
as your equal is dangerous.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.934
He's a power-hungry
insecure man

11:42.936 --> 11:44.102
who's capable of anything.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.304
He is also
a political necessity,

11:46.306 --> 11:49.007
so I must manage him
as best I can.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.108
And by taking his money,

11:50.110 --> 11:51.743
I will take a piece
of his power.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.845
But bringing him back
into your life...

11:53.847 --> 11:56.014
it opens the doors
to other demands.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.782
Not to mention how much
I hate the idea

11:57.784 --> 11:59.150
of him being near you.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.952
The truth is,

12:00.954 --> 12:03.154
I can't put my feelings
for you aside.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.324
For my safety
and yours, you must.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.760
I hate this, too,
Bothwell.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.129
But what else can I do?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.405
(knock on door)

12:23.744 --> 12:26.377
Oh, um, put
the bread down,

12:26.379 --> 12:27.846
and tell the baker
from now on

12:27.848 --> 12:29.748
I do not wish
to be disturbed.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.852
It appears I've
disturbed you already.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.856
Not at all.
I'm just stunned.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.257
You're unrecognizable.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.026
That is the point.
Mm.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.528
I told everyone at the castle
I needed a few days

12:43.530 --> 12:45.864
at a secluded retreat.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.198
And the moment
I put on this disguise,

12:47.200 --> 12:48.533
I wasn't afraid anymore.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.870
Gideon, it's so wonderful.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.873
Ah, for a few days
I'm not Queen Elizabeth,

12:54.875 --> 12:59.077
but Julia,
the baker's daughter.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.947
Well, allow me
to introduce myself.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.184
Captain Bernard,
retired navy man.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.952
(chuckles)

13:09.422 --> 13:10.955
It's a pleasure,
Captain.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.891
But now that I'm here safe,

13:12.893 --> 13:14.826
there's no need
for this disguise.
No.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.027
I like it.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.262
(chuckles)

13:19.533 --> 13:21.833
NARCISSE:<i> Henri,</i>
<i> you can't expect me to believe</i>

13:21.835 --> 13:24.836
that Charles has won
your respect?

13:24.838 --> 13:27.338
Why not?
After all, he is

13:27.340 --> 13:30.041
my older, more
experienced brother.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.310
A point he constantly
enjoys making.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.813
In fact, I'm on my way
to a meeting

13:34.815 --> 13:36.514
with Charles and
his generals now.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.383
He thought it would
be good for me

13:38.385 --> 13:40.518
to learn leadership
at his kingly knee.

13:42.155 --> 13:46.558
I feel a strange kind
of kinship towards you, Henri,

13:46.560 --> 13:48.193
so I know that you are
not the type

13:48.195 --> 13:49.460
to give up so easily.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.830
Oh, I haven't given up.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.132
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.900
And what is that moment?

13:55.902 --> 13:58.136
I'll know it
when I see it.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.174
A delicate situation
has developed here,

14:03.176 --> 14:05.910
Granville, a coastal
region where several

14:05.912 --> 14:07.612
English expatriates
reside.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.215
Two English lords are refusing
to pay taxes

14:10.217 --> 14:11.983
to the French Crown.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.953
What's delicate
about that?

14:14.955 --> 14:17.288
Taking official action
against foreign citizens

14:17.290 --> 14:19.023
risks a diplomatic
incident.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.459
The English lords
are also Protestant.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.494
Their refusal to pay
a Catholic king

14:23.496 --> 14:26.264
has inspired the French
Protestants to do the same.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.633
It could inspire
a full-on rebellion.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.269
I see.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.605
In my experience,
Protestant rebellions

14:33.607 --> 14:35.340
need to be put down firmly.

14:35.342 --> 14:39.043
I've done it before,
and my people were grateful.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.345
I even have a baby
named after me.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.181
That is impressive.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.650
I wonder, Henri,

14:45.652 --> 14:47.418
what would you do
in this situation?

14:47.420 --> 14:50.188
It's not for me to say.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.290
But in my experience,
I've found it best

14:52.292 --> 14:54.626
to wait for an advantage
before I strike.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.895
Then it's a good thing
you aren't the king.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.135
Two weeks ago,

15:04.137 --> 15:06.070
when Henri challenged
his throne,

15:06.072 --> 15:08.673
Charles was
understandably shaken.

15:08.675 --> 15:12.176
Now he practically shoots
his brother's hand off,

15:12.178 --> 15:13.578
and Henri does nothing.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.113
What changed?

15:15.115 --> 15:17.215
Perhaps nothing, and
you were wrong to doubt

15:17.217 --> 15:19.217
both Charles and me.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.519
He is a strong king.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.088
Or you are hiding
something.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.158
You heard me, General,
round up every tax offender

15:27.160 --> 15:29.227
and throw them
in debtors' jail at once.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.162
But, Your Majesty,
putting English nobles

15:31.164 --> 15:33.264
in a pauper's prison
is unprecedented.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.299
Perhaps a stern warning.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.067
I've made my decision!

15:36.069 --> 15:37.702
I am the king,
and the king's word is law.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.371
Henri, tell me that
I didn't just hear your brother

15:40.373 --> 15:43.174
order the arrest
of English nobility.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.309
I'm surprised
you could hear anything

15:44.311 --> 15:46.444
over the sound
of his lion-like roar.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.579
Face it, Mother,

15:48.581 --> 15:51.149
Charles is out of control.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.554
Whatever you've done, and
whatever you are going to do,

15:56.556 --> 15:59.290
if it involves
propping up Charles,

15:59.292 --> 16:00.358
you are playing
a very dangerous game.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.109
Mother, what in God's name
are you doing?

16:18.111 --> 16:20.211
It is none
of your business.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.612
CLAUDE:
What is that?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.114
What are you doing sneaking
into my chambers?

16:23.116 --> 16:24.482
Returning your earrings
and uncovering

16:24.484 --> 16:26.584
your pact with the devil,
apparently.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.520
It wasn't a pact.
It was one tiny spell.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.056
It was a good luck
charm, really.

16:32.058 --> 16:36.194
I was only trying to help
Charles feel stronger.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.129
Are you telling me
that this heresy

16:38.131 --> 16:40.231
is the reason Charles has
been so aggressive lately?

16:40.233 --> 16:43.634
No. Maybe. I might have
overdone the ram's horn...

16:43.636 --> 16:44.635
Mother!

16:44.637 --> 16:46.204
I promise, I promise,

16:46.206 --> 16:47.271
I will never
do this again.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.273
Clearly, Charles has
gone too far.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.609
Once I remove the spell,

16:51.611 --> 16:53.478
I will try to fix
the situation

16:53.480 --> 16:55.279
with conventional methods.
How?

16:55.281 --> 16:58.182
I'll write to a French lord
that I know in Granville,

16:58.184 --> 17:00.284
and I'll ask him
to convince the English

17:00.286 --> 17:01.285
to negotiate.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.487
Charles can't know

17:02.489 --> 17:03.688
that I've had anything
to do with this,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.523
because he'll refuse.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.692
And Narcisse
can't know either,

17:07.694 --> 17:09.260
so don't tell Luc.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.461
I'm not going to lie
for you, Mother.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.296
That's not who I am.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.567
Since when?

17:16.569 --> 17:21.172
Tell me, how are you
and Luc getting along?

17:21.174 --> 17:22.240
We're not.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.742
I don't like him at all.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.811
I heard you were
practically swooning

17:26.813 --> 17:28.646
during archery.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.815
Admit it, you're
attracted to your husband,

17:30.817 --> 17:32.617
and you're lying
about it.

17:32.619 --> 17:36.320
Because I<i> can't</i> have
feelings for Luc.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.156
I swore to Leith I wouldn't
fall in love with him.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.757
I know that Luc isn't the man

17:39.759 --> 17:42.126
that you wanted to spend
the rest of your life with,

17:42.128 --> 17:44.262
but you've made promises
to him, too.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.765
Luc needs an heir
to carry his family's name.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.234
It's an arranged marriage,
not a promise from the heart.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.336
No, but a promise nonetheless.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.105
So you've told Leith
that you won't fall in love

17:54.107 --> 17:57.175
with anyone else, and
you've promised Luc an heir.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.577
Do you really think that
you can keep both promises?

17:59.579 --> 18:03.281
Yes. Yes, I do.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.590
(door creaks)

18:14.260 --> 18:16.427
Oh. Claude.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.863
I didn't hear you...
I should have knocked.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.265
No, it's fine.
Did you want something?

18:25.405 --> 18:29.340
Yes... actually.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.156
Are you sure about this?

18:59.906 --> 19:02.173
(indistinct chatter)

19:12.852 --> 19:14.719
It's good to be back.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.387
So many people
turned out

19:16.389 --> 19:19.857
to praise our generosity.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.726
Lord Kinloch traveled
three hours to be here.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.828
I'm surprised
he came at all.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.464
Kinloch hasn't been
to court in months.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.433
Not since I ruled against him
in a property dispute.

19:29.435 --> 19:30.902
I suppose I should
attribute his presence

19:30.904 --> 19:33.271
to your popularity.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.908
Yes. Everyone but you
seems happy to see me.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.443
I'm smiling, aren't I?

19:39.445 --> 19:41.746
Your doting wife
sharing the limelight.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.382
You're getting
everything you want.

19:44.384 --> 19:47.218
As will you, Mary.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.753
I will have the money delivered
as soon as

19:48.755 --> 19:50.354
this evening is
a success

19:50.356 --> 19:52.190
and my things are
brought back to court.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.392
In the meantime,

19:54.394 --> 19:57.195
we should give the people
what they want.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.605
Thank you all for coming.

20:07.607 --> 20:11.442
These have been
somber times for Scotland.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.778
When I heard of the
tragedies in the Highland,

20:13.780 --> 20:16.514
I cut short my visit
to my family home

20:16.516 --> 20:19.350
and rushed back to be
at my wife's side.

20:19.352 --> 20:22.386
I told Queen Mary
that it is our duty

20:22.388 --> 20:24.255
to act quickly.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.424
We vow to do
everything in our power

20:26.426 --> 20:29.493
to help those victims
who have lost all they have.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.462
(applause, cheers)

20:33.399 --> 20:34.699
To Scotland.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.968
GUESTS:
To Scotland!

20:36.970 --> 20:40.938
I am proud to be king
of this beautiful country,

20:40.940 --> 20:45.309
as I am husband
to my beautiful queen.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.547
(applause)

20:54.988 --> 20:57.288
Was that really necessary?

20:57.290 --> 20:59.757
Well, when you finally announce
that we're expecting a child,

20:59.759 --> 21:02.326
you want people to believe
that I'm the father, don't you?

21:02.328 --> 21:04.462
Besides,

21:04.464 --> 21:06.597
I enjoyed it.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.901
Although I can't say the same
for Lord Bothwell.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.703
(Mary sighs)

21:12.705 --> 21:14.839
You can't expect everyone
to be glad

21:14.841 --> 21:16.407
you're back at court, Darnley.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.475
Some of us know you.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.776
(chuckles softly)

21:20.513 --> 21:23.281
Mary, I think Rizzio needs
to speak with you.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.849
MARY:
Oh. It might be important.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.817
The Italian ambassador
was complaining

21:26.819 --> 21:28.519
about a trade agreement earlier.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.454
If you start talking
to that windbag now,

21:30.456 --> 21:31.656
you'll be gone for days.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.057
I should handle this.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.493
Give my apologies to our guests.

21:40.466 --> 21:44.302
Bothwell is waiting outside
with horses and queensguard.

21:44.304 --> 21:47.538
I'll return as soon as the
money is safe at the church.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.907
Help Greer keep
Darnley occupied.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.776
Already arranged
a steady flow of wine.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.678

21:57.784 --> 21:59.784
Thank you for this, Gideon.

21:59.786 --> 22:04.388
I've never been able to forget
who I am, not even for a moment.

22:04.390 --> 22:07.091
But you gave me
a way to escape.
Hmm.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.360
(laughing):
And it's wonderful.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.695
Julia and Bernard
have a good life.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.663
Mm-hmm. I envy them.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.765
Mm.
Although
they are quite poor

22:14.767 --> 22:17.501
and powerless,

22:17.503 --> 22:19.503
and their clothes itch.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.605
But they are free to love
without fear.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.776
And they can even do this...

22:31.651 --> 22:33.718
There's something else
I'd like to do.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.486
Mm-hmm?

22:35.488 --> 22:37.521
I've always wondered
if queens can swim.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.440
What are you...?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.577
Oh, my God.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.745
W-What are you doing here?

23:00.747 --> 23:04.515
You left court, Your Majesty.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.385
I-I was given time off
to visit family.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.820
Please let me go.
No one has to know I was here,

23:09.822 --> 23:11.489
we could just pretend
it never happened.

23:11.491 --> 23:15.526
I swear on my life,
I will say nothing.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.961
Of course you won't.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.629
You're a loyal servant, Jane.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.598
Her Majesty knows
this isn't your fault.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.401
It's just
an unfortunate misunderstand...
(grunts)

23:25.505 --> 23:27.505
Elizabeth.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.572
She saw too much.

23:39.719 --> 23:43.521
Lord Kinloch, I hope to see more
of you in court from now on.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.856
(chuckles softly) I doubt
your wife feels the same way.

23:45.858 --> 23:48.826
Clearly, she was avoiding
at least one of us tonight.

23:48.828 --> 23:52.997
But I look forward
to seeing more of the king.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.700
Despite the weather,
your evening

23:56.702 --> 23:57.768
looks like quite the success.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.904
Yes. It was.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.739
No thanks to Mary.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.707
She's not even here to say
good-bye to our guests.

24:03.709 --> 24:06.877
The Italian situation
must have become complicated.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.546
Still, it's odd.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.448
There are a lot of politically
important people here.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.450
It's not like Mary
to risk offending them

24:12.452 --> 24:14.518
and...

24:14.520 --> 24:16.520
Unless she had something
to gain.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.489
Now that I think
about it,

24:18.491 --> 24:20.958
Lord Bothwell has also been
missing for most of the evening.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.161
I... hadn't noticed.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.698
I wasn't supposed
to notice either, was I?

24:27.700 --> 24:28.966
Any chance you're
going to tell me

24:28.968 --> 24:31.469
what he and Mary are up to?

24:31.471 --> 24:35.473
How silly of me, I accidentally
opened another bottle.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.974
Care for some wine,
Your Majesty?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.909
Never mind.

24:38.911 --> 24:42.913
I think I know exactly
where they've gone.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.651
CATHERINE:
<i> Charles.</i>

24:47.653 --> 24:48.986
It's late.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.921
Is something wrong?

24:50.923 --> 24:53.123
Uh, just the opposite, actually.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.560
I received a letter
from a French lord in Granville

24:56.562 --> 24:59.497
who says the English
would like to negotiate.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.065
That's wonderful.

25:01.067 --> 25:05.069
You can tell General LeCroix
to hold off on their arrest.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.540
If you think
that's what should be done.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.976
Well...

25:11.978 --> 25:13.878
Suppose it's worth
reconsidering.
Mm.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.047
But I don't want to appear weak.

25:17.049 --> 25:20.885
Well, avoiding conflict
isn't weak, it's smart.

25:20.887 --> 25:25.523
Sending a man to debtor's prison
makes it harder for him to pay.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.625
I think this meeting
is a chance to show them

25:27.627 --> 25:31.996
how strong and confident
you really are.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.131
Maybe you're right.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.966
I'll send word

25:35.967 --> 25:37.800
and meet with the two
English lords immediately.

25:37.803 --> 25:38.936
Thank you, Mother.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.671
Of course.

25:40.673 --> 25:44.074
Anything I can do to help
my son, the king.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.315
(muffled whimpering)

25:51.317 --> 25:53.250
She saw us.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.619
Gideon.

25:55.621 --> 25:58.322
I cannot risk
my reputation.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.858
I am the "Virgin Queen"!

26:00.860 --> 26:02.159
Not to mention,
my marriage

26:02.161 --> 26:05.296
to the archduke
is my best protection

26:05.298 --> 26:07.031
against my enemies.
That engagement

26:07.033 --> 26:09.266
will be undone
if this girl lives to speak.

26:09.268 --> 26:12.269
Because you and I spent
a carefree moment together,

26:12.271 --> 26:15.005
an innocent girl, a loyal
servant, must lose her life?

26:15.007 --> 26:16.206
Yes.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.741
She is a danger!

26:17.743 --> 26:20.878
What are innocence
and loyalty to me?

26:20.880 --> 26:24.648
Lola was both, and she conspired
to have me killed.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.617
Lola actively betrayed you,

26:26.619 --> 26:29.286
you had no choice,
and still her death haunts you.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.922
Jane has done nothing.
She's only guilty

26:31.924 --> 26:33.057
of being in the wrong place

26:33.059 --> 26:34.625
at the wrong time.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.026
How will you feel with her blood

26:36.028 --> 26:37.361
on your hands?
Safe.

26:37.363 --> 26:40.097
And when you are the
queen of England,

26:40.099 --> 26:43.133
that is the only feeling
that matters.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.038
(sighs)

26:48.040 --> 26:49.640
Guards are still searching,

26:49.642 --> 26:50.941
but they've found
no money hidden anywhere.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.810
There has to be.
This chest was full.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.378
You can't wait any longer.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.747
Take what money you have
and we'll find the rest later.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.983
Your Majesty,
kingsguard are approaching.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.684
I've been gone for too long,

27:00.686 --> 27:03.020
and Darnley must have suspected
why I left.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.755
Take the queen and the gold
and get to Father Quinn.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.026
You must secure
what money you have

27:09.028 --> 27:10.361
in the church fund.

27:10.363 --> 27:11.962
Bothwell, you can't stay.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.731
If Darnley finds you here
and the money gone...

27:13.733 --> 27:16.000
Your only chance
is if I slow him down.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.201
Go.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.110
Search the house.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.050
Where's my wife?

27:33.052 --> 27:34.985
Dealing with urgent business.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.855
Meaning she stole my money and
left you here to deal with me.

27:37.857 --> 27:41.025
I believe what she said was...

27:41.027 --> 27:43.761
"Clean up my mess."

27:43.763 --> 27:47.064
Then Mary has left me
in a very interesting situation.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.166
On the one hand, I
finally have you alone

27:49.168 --> 27:51.101
without your
royal protector.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.137
On the other hand,
she has taken my money

27:53.139 --> 27:55.172
and I should probably go
and get it back.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.875
Luckily, I have
kingsguard.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.176
We'll divide and conquer.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.211
I can't let you do that.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.747
You think you can stop me?
I'm the king of Scotland.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.949
I could have you killed
for just touching me.

28:05.951 --> 28:08.285
You make good on the threat,
lest you're just hollow words.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.988
You're actually willing
to die for her.

28:10.990 --> 28:14.024
I thought you just hated
me, but you love her.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.361
Oh, that's gonna make
this feel even better.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.229
(grunting)

28:28.207 --> 28:30.774
Guards!

28:33.813 --> 28:35.212
That was a mistake.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.313
Give him a beating.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.381
(grunting)

28:47.126 --> 28:49.193
It's dark enough now.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.995
I'll take Jane
to the woods and...

28:51.997 --> 28:54.765
when I return,
we can return to court.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.033
You've killed for me before.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.735
This is no different.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.870
And when it's done,
you will feel no safer.

28:59.872 --> 29:02.039
Gideon.
No, can you really tell me

29:02.041 --> 29:03.941
that when Lola died,
you felt safer?

29:03.943 --> 29:05.342
Or just more alone?

29:05.344 --> 29:07.211
It's my fault
this is happening.

29:07.213 --> 29:10.848
I asked you to come here
as an escape, but...

29:10.850 --> 29:14.218
but you feel there is danger
around every corner,

29:14.220 --> 29:16.820
doubt that you can trust anyone
because of who you are.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.489
And I can't help you
escape that.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.357
(knocking on door)

29:31.771 --> 29:34.037
(muffled screaming)

29:34.039 --> 29:35.506
What's this about?

29:35.507 --> 29:36.974
We're searching
for a missing girl.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.542
Ah.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.109
A fisherman was bringing
his boat in just before sundown,

29:40.112 --> 29:41.345
saw a scuffle down the shore.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.013
There's no girl here.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.019
I can't.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.890
Run.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.025
And don't let anyone hear you.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.328
Go out the back.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.031
And if you tell anyone
about this, I will hunt you down

30:01.033 --> 30:02.266
and kill your entire family.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.168
Do you understand?

30:04.170 --> 30:05.869
Yes. Yes...

30:09.041 --> 30:10.274
Try not to worry.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.009
Rizzio is out looking
for what Darnley

30:12.011 --> 30:13.511
did with that money.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.012
Hopefully there will be
a way to reclaim it.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.915
I'm more concerned about leaving
Bothwell with Darnley.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.517
Every minute that passes with
neither one of them returning...

30:20.519 --> 30:22.152
Bothwell had to buy time
to allow you

30:22.154 --> 30:23.487
to deliver the money
to the church.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.889
But he would
never harm Darnley,

30:25.891 --> 30:27.958
knowing the risk
it would bring to you.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.026
And what's to stop Darnley
from harming Bothwell?

30:30.029 --> 30:31.195
Darnley's back.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.362
He's brought
Bothwell with him.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.131
Is Bothwell all right?

30:34.133 --> 30:36.500
I didn't see. The kingsguard
put him under arrest.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.236
The privy council meeting
is tomorrow morning.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.104
Did you find the missing money?

30:41.106 --> 30:43.407
Darnley spent it.
He's been buying property,

30:43.409 --> 30:46.043
including the disputed land
you took from Lord Kinloch.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.878
But for what purpose?

30:47.880 --> 30:50.981
He's been buying influence
with my enemies.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.318
He's been actively working
against me,

30:54.320 --> 30:55.853
bleeding Scotland

30:55.855 --> 30:57.921
to gain power for himself.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.225
(door opens)

31:01.227 --> 31:04.895
This is what
you planned all along.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.931
You forced me to bring you back
to court, not just for your ego,

31:07.933 --> 31:11.034
but so you could use my money
to buy yourself influence.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.403
And Lord Kinloch
is now a loyal ally.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.938
How low will you sink?

31:14.940 --> 31:17.040
Your desire for power
is no surprise,

31:17.042 --> 31:18.475
but you've taken it
a step too far.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.444
You are now actively working

31:20.446 --> 31:22.946
against me
and the Scottish people.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.481
And what have you done, Mary?

31:24.483 --> 31:26.216
You lied to me, stole from me,

31:26.218 --> 31:27.885
and have betrayed me
with another man.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.419
What are you talking about?

31:29.421 --> 31:31.455
Your Lord Bothwell
all but told me to my face

31:31.457 --> 31:33.223
that he is in love with you.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.092
But don't worry, darling.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.961
I defended your honor by beating
him within an inch of his life.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.596
What have you done?

31:39.598 --> 31:41.431
If Bothwell dies,
I swear to you...

31:41.433 --> 31:44.201
He won't die.

31:44.203 --> 31:48.472
Killing Bothwell would've
made it look like I care.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.140
Just as fearing him dead
has revealed

31:50.142 --> 31:52.075
your true feelings about him,

31:52.077 --> 31:54.344
which puts you in a
precarious position,

31:54.346 --> 31:57.214
given that child
you're carrying.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.984
It is your child.

32:00.986 --> 32:04.521
Nothing has ever happened
between Bothwell and me.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.356
The only reason

32:06.358 --> 32:10.027
he returned to court
was to protect me from you.

32:10.029 --> 32:13.230
Tell him I said...

32:14.433 --> 32:16.166
..."Good luck."

32:19.305 --> 32:21.271
NARCISSE:
<i> Luc, I need to talk to you</i>

32:21.273 --> 32:23.140
about Claude.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.641
If you're going to ask me

32:24.643 --> 32:26.276
to spy on my wife
to get information

32:26.278 --> 32:29.579
about Charles or Henri,
the answer is no,

32:29.581 --> 32:32.115
especially not now that
Claude and I have decided

32:32.117 --> 32:34.551
to pursue a real marriage.

32:34.553 --> 32:38.188
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
especially as I found this.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.224
The pursuit of information
on Charles

32:41.226 --> 32:44.161
led my spies at court
to intercept this letter.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.129
(sighs)

32:46.131 --> 32:47.464
Claude hired investigators
to locate Leith

32:47.466 --> 32:48.465
and deliver it to him.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.267
Leith?

32:50.269 --> 32:51.668
But he's been gone for months.

32:51.670 --> 32:55.505
According to this letter,
Claude promises to join him

32:55.507 --> 32:58.208
once she has provided you
with an heir.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.510
I am sorry, Luc,

33:00.512 --> 33:02.512
but there are factions forming
within the Valois family,

33:02.514 --> 33:05.515
and our survival depends
on using every resource we have,

33:05.517 --> 33:08.151
including your marriage,
to ensure we ally ourselves

33:08.153 --> 33:09.319
with the winning side.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.222
That's not the kind of marriage
I wanted.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.191
But apparently
it's the kind you have.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.666
Oh, God, there you are.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.502
I've just learned that
His Majesty is returning

33:25.504 --> 33:28.205
from Granville, so we are
all here to congratulate him.

33:28.207 --> 33:31.241
You seem awfully confident
of Charles' success.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.510
Too confident.
What did you do?

33:33.512 --> 33:35.212
(laughing):
Nothing.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.181
Charles just made
a very reasonable decision

33:38.183 --> 33:40.350
to negotiate
with the tax offenders.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.252
(horns trumpeting)
Not much glory in that.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.154
CATHERINE: A true king
doesn't seek glory,

33:44.156 --> 33:45.689
he seeks peace.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.624
Spoken like a queen.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.194
(woman shouts)
CATHERINE: Dear God.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.462
(gasps)

33:52.464 --> 33:54.097
The Englishmen.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.233
I can't believe
Charles took their heads.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.300
NARCISSE: Arresting them
would've been bad enough,

33:57.302 --> 33:59.202
this is the act of a madman

33:59.204 --> 34:00.270
leading us to war.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.072
CATHERINE: Charles.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.140
(whispering):
Charles.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.207
Charles.

34:15.154 --> 34:15.986
What are we going to do?

34:15.987 --> 34:16.819
We have to find a way
to help Charles.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.222
We can't...

34:19.224 --> 34:21.124
or at least I can't.

34:21.126 --> 34:22.459
I can't help you

34:22.461 --> 34:25.062
because I can't be with you,

34:25.064 --> 34:26.363
not anymore.

34:26.365 --> 34:28.098
(laughing):
What are you talking about?

34:33.105 --> 34:35.138
Oh, where did you get that?

34:35.140 --> 34:36.206
(sighs)

34:36.207 --> 34:37.273
I would have told you
eventually.

34:37.276 --> 34:38.675
When?

34:38.677 --> 34:40.510
After you left me to raise
our child alone?

34:40.512 --> 34:42.345
Look, Luc, you don't understand.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.848
You promised another man
that you would never love me.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.617
And I wanted to keep that
promise more than anything,

34:47.619 --> 34:50.153
but it may already be too late.

34:50.155 --> 34:54.224
I think I could grow
to love you, too, Luc,

34:54.226 --> 34:56.193
and that makes me feel terrible.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.661
Why?

34:57.663 --> 34:59.463
Because I made a vow to Leith.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.531
I grew up in this house,

35:01.533 --> 35:04.568
surrounded by lies and betrayal.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.471
If I break my
promise, my vow...

35:07.473 --> 35:11.308
I'm no better than my mother
or your father

35:11.310 --> 35:12.709
or anyone here at court.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.244
Don't you see?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.879
I don't want to become
one of them.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.781
You won't.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.650
I'll make sure you
keep your promise.

35:20.652 --> 35:24.821
I'm done asking for your heart
and offering you mine.

35:24.823 --> 35:29.226
From now on, our marriage
will be a political formality,

35:29.228 --> 35:30.460
nothing more.

35:39.138 --> 35:42.639
What in God's name
did you do?

35:42.641 --> 35:45.842
I ordered their heads cut off.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.878
There was so much blood.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.347
(whispering):
Charles, what happened?

35:50.349 --> 35:54.351
The plan was to talk to the
English lords, to negotiate.

35:54.353 --> 35:55.752
That was my plan.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.921
I felt so confident
and powerful,

35:57.923 --> 36:00.423
and then suddenly
it all went away.

36:00.425 --> 36:03.426
I realized,
what if it was a trap?

36:03.428 --> 36:05.595
What if the French Protestants
found out about the meeting

36:05.597 --> 36:07.831
and used it to spark
a rebellion?

36:07.833 --> 36:10.500
No, I had to do something
to prove myself.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.902
Wha...
I constantly have
to prove myself

36:11.904 --> 36:14.905
or people will rise against me!

36:14.907 --> 36:17.874
My dearest boy,

36:17.876 --> 36:20.177
this is all my fault.

36:20.179 --> 36:22.846
I've made you like this.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.248
Charles, please forgive me.

36:26.852 --> 36:31.521
I just wanted to protect
you by making you strong.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.390
Strong?

36:33.392 --> 36:37.761
I am not strong; I am weak,
and everyone can see it but you.

36:37.763 --> 36:41.364
First Leeza, then Henri.

36:41.366 --> 36:45.802
I couldn't let England
see that, or my own people.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.905
That's why I ordered
those heads cut off,

36:48.907 --> 36:52.876
to hide the truth
about what I really am.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.713
I'm afraid.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.893
GIDEON: Several nobles are
waiting to welcome you back.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.662
They trust your sabbatical
was rejuvenating.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.664
In a way, it was.

37:14.666 --> 37:17.834
You were right about Lola's
death haunting me, Gideon.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.469
When she was
brought to execution,

37:19.471 --> 37:22.372
she had a look in her eyes
I will never forget.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.542
Jane had that same look.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.711
Elizabeth, I know you
may not feel any safer,

37:27.713 --> 37:29.379
but you did the right thing,

37:29.381 --> 37:31.548
letting her flee.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.784
Or maybe I just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.024
ELIZABETH: Jane.

37:41.994 --> 37:43.627
What are you doing here?

37:44.596 --> 37:47.564
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,

37:47.566 --> 37:49.766
but I had nowhere else to go.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.769
You must know you're signing
your own death warrant.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.005
Would it be any different
if I hadn't returned?

37:55.007 --> 37:57.874
Knowing I was alive, you would
always have reason to fear me.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.010
This way, I have a chance
to convince you

38:00.012 --> 38:01.678
I was telling the truth.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.681
I swore I would keep
your secret and I will.

38:04.683 --> 38:08.685
You don't know me well enough
to trust me, but I know you.

38:08.687 --> 38:12.889
I grew up in this court;
I have watched you all my life.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.892
I knew about Lord Dudley,

38:15.894 --> 38:18.895
and I never said a thing.

38:18.897 --> 38:21.431
Please, I need this work.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.835
JANE:<i> Her Majesty</i>
<i> agreed to let me stay.</i>

38:25.837 --> 38:27.771
<i> The terrible coincidence</i>
<i> of our encounter</i>

38:27.773 --> 38:29.606
<i> brought some good, after all.</i>

38:29.608 --> 38:31.675
<i> Elizabeth trusts me,</i>
<i> despite what I know</i>

38:31.677 --> 38:34.477
<i>that could be used against her,</i>
<i> and now, because of her trust,</i>

38:34.479 --> 38:36.780
<i> we will be able</i>
<i> to learn so much more.</i>

38:39.851 --> 38:41.951
What happened?

38:41.953 --> 38:43.820
I was told that the
court ambassador to England

38:43.822 --> 38:45.955
was waiting
in the throne room,

38:45.957 --> 38:48.525
insisting on speaking
with the king.

38:48.527 --> 38:51.027
He was, as were our own nobles.
They were up in arms, as well,

38:51.029 --> 38:53.830
but Henri took charge.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.900
He used the situation
to his own advantage.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.338
His speech was
quite stirring,

39:01.340 --> 39:03.640
something about
Englishmen being swine

39:03.642 --> 39:05.742
and how France would
never back down.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.712
Our French nobles,
they were cheering,

39:08.714 --> 39:12.482
but the ambassador, well,
he didn't take it quite so well.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.118
I suppose he's
returned to England

39:15.120 --> 39:16.986
to report to Elizabeth.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.988
On the very next ship.

39:18.990 --> 39:24.127
You have to admit,
I was right about Henri.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.629
That boy has talent.

39:26.631 --> 39:29.733
Unfortunately, it's a
talent for going after

39:29.735 --> 39:32.402
what doesn't belong to him.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.572
You're wasting your time
with the wrong man.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.574
Excuse me?

39:37.576 --> 39:39.509
Your brother is
the king of France.

39:39.511 --> 39:43.012
Not Charles-- we both know
you don't care about him.

39:43.014 --> 39:45.482
I'm talking about Narcisse.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.584
He's not the man for you.

39:47.586 --> 39:50.520
And who is?

39:54.993 --> 39:56.993
It's not as bad as it looks.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.596
I imagine it's worse.
(chuckles)

39:59.598 --> 40:01.131
Darnley could've killed you.

40:01.133 --> 40:03.166
Next time,
he won't hold back.

40:03.168 --> 40:07.103
But now he knows that while
he's the father of your child,

40:07.105 --> 40:10.840
he'll never be
the man that you love.

40:10.842 --> 40:14.043
No. That is someone else.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.147
(grunts)

40:17.149 --> 40:19.149
If Darnley is
no longer motivated

40:19.151 --> 40:20.850
to share your power,

40:20.852 --> 40:22.852
he's gonna try and take it.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.688
He's a threat to your throne
and to your life, Mary.

40:25.690 --> 40:28.024
You need to get rid of him.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.527
I'm not ready to talk

40:30.529 --> 40:32.695
about killing a king...

40:34.199 --> 40:38.201
...or to have my child
without a father.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.103
There has to be another way,

40:40.105 --> 40:41.871
and I will find it,

40:41.873 --> 40:43.773
as long as I have you
by my side.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.081
DARNLEY:
That bitch.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.550
I am her Catholic husband,

40:53.552 --> 40:55.919
and she uses the Church
against me.

40:55.921 --> 40:58.688
She thinks that she can
refuse me the Crown Matrimonial,

40:58.690 --> 41:00.223
cut me off financially,

41:00.225 --> 41:03.893
and I will just sit quietly
like a beaten dog.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.161
KNOX:
You were on the right track,

41:05.163 --> 41:07.864
winning Lord Kinloch
to your side.

41:07.866 --> 41:10.099
Now you must win
the privy council.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.001
They blame Mary for
mishandling the money

41:12.003 --> 41:13.670
for the disaster relief.

41:13.672 --> 41:16.673
You could win them over
with a few targeted payments.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.741
As you pointed out,
I have no money.

41:18.743 --> 41:20.076
I can raise all we need.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.111
With the right people
on our side,

41:22.113 --> 41:25.582
I could convince the council
to override Mary

41:25.584 --> 41:28.117
and grant you
the Crown Matrimonial.

41:28.119 --> 41:29.953
Why would you do that for me?

41:29.955 --> 41:33.490
Our mutual distaste of Mary
doesn't exactly make us friends,

41:33.492 --> 41:35.225
and I am a Catholic.

41:35.227 --> 41:36.693
You are a man,

41:36.695 --> 41:38.094
a man whose strength
and leadership

41:38.096 --> 41:39.963
cannot be cast aside.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.631
Now, I am more than willing
to make an investment

41:41.633 --> 41:42.966
in Scotland's future,

41:42.968 --> 41:45.835
if that future is free
of the queen.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.938
As for your religious
convictions,

41:48.940 --> 41:51.841
there is such a thing
as conversion.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.211
Perhaps I should keep
an open mind.
