WEBVTT

00:05.322 --> 00:07.189
I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

00:07.191 --> 00:10.275
Only some of you
are gonna get this job.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.361
It's a business
of broken hearts.

00:12.363 --> 00:15.480
But you know that...
you're professionals.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.650
They're so cute! I just want

00:18.652 --> 00:20.836
to eat your little faces off!

00:21.838 --> 00:23.505
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

00:23.507 --> 00:24.556
Okay, babies,

00:24.558 --> 00:26.091
for the purpose
of this audition,

00:26.093 --> 00:29.761
you're babies, wearing our
client's cute little outfits.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.162
And... action.

00:37.738 --> 00:38.971
And scene.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.439
Many of you were very good.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.773
You, sir, were dogging it.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.525
You know you were.
Yeah.

00:43.527 --> 00:44.643
Look at him.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.028
Someone has baby fever.

00:46.030 --> 00:47.696
Guilty.
Our creative director,

00:47.698 --> 00:49.398
my daughter,
is in a promising relationship,

00:49.400 --> 00:52.451
and I hope that one of you
is in my near future.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.536
And auditions like these
will be unnecessary,

00:54.538 --> 00:56.622
because clearly
I'm a big fan of nepotism.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.241
Hey, piglet, how about
you and me truffle hunt.

00:59.243 --> 01:00.409

01:27.955 --> 01:30.105
Morning, beautiful.

01:30.107 --> 01:33.492
I bet you say that to all the women who
take you in after they get you fired.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.493
All of 'em.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.230
Mm. No, I can't.

01:39.232 --> 01:42.334
- I'm gonna be late for work.
- No, come on, you nerd.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.453
You don't have to be
on time for work.

01:44.455 --> 01:46.705
Listen, a very wise
person once said:

01:46.707 --> 01:48.239
"No matter what you do,

01:48.241 --> 01:50.926
"it's bound to be a waste
of time in the end,

01:50.928 --> 01:52.711
so you may as
well go mad."

01:52.713 --> 01:53.979
Who was that, Jack Kerouac?

01:53.981 --> 01:55.130
Kim Cattrall.

01:55.132 --> 01:56.431
Well, in that case...

01:56.433 --> 01:58.300
I guess I could be
a little late.

01:58.302 --> 01:59.918
There you go.
It's chill.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.770
Yeah. Oh, hey,

02:01.772 --> 02:04.573
I'm gonna hit the bathroom,
unless you need it first.

02:04.575 --> 02:06.692
Oh, no. You go.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.810
I hardly ever use the bathroom.

02:08.812 --> 02:10.228
Hey, Jaleel.
Me, again.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.564
Hey, I don't even
know if I told you.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.100
I just started seeing this guy,
and he lost his job when

02:15.102 --> 02:16.651
I made out with him
when he was cater-waitering,

02:16.653 --> 02:17.903
but his roommate
was also his boss,

02:17.905 --> 02:19.721
so he also lost the couch
that he was sleeping on,

02:19.723 --> 02:20.889
and I'm kind of letting him
live with me

02:20.891 --> 02:22.074
in the meantime...

02:22.076 --> 02:23.575
anyway, you know,
it's a little too early

02:23.577 --> 02:24.943
or him to be thinking about me

02:24.945 --> 02:26.211
having, you know...
biological functions,

02:26.213 --> 02:27.429
so if I could just, uh,

02:27.431 --> 02:29.831
one more...
You da best, J-Man.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.118
That's new.

02:34.587 --> 02:36.287
Okay.

02:36.289 --> 02:39.107
Uh... oh, I'll take the one
with the princess lighting up.

02:39.109 --> 02:41.576
I don't smoke, but she's cute.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.011
Okay.

02:43.013 --> 02:46.932
I promise, last time, J-Man.
You da best.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.944
Nice, real nice.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.812
You should be paying <i>me</i>
to use your bathroom.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.081
I'm the only one cleaning it.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.984
Oh, fine.
Give me three packs.

03:10.023 --> 03:14.843
So, what if we had
a JetSky Airlines plane

03:14.845 --> 03:17.129
shaking hands with of one of the
many continents they fly over?

03:17.131 --> 03:19.347
Do you mean something
like... this?

03:20.183 --> 03:22.350
Bingo.
Synchronicity much?

03:22.352 --> 03:24.202
I got to tell you something,
Andrew... you are by far the best

03:24.204 --> 03:27.222
art director I have ever worked with,
hands down. SIMON: You've been doing some

03:27.224 --> 03:28.557
great work, Andrew, and I'm not
just saying that 'cause Zach's

03:28.559 --> 03:29.741
on vacation.
Is he back yet?

03:29.743 --> 03:31.026
I made him promise to text me

03:31.028 --> 03:33.445
when he got back. I don't see
why he needs a vacation.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.980
Every day's a vacation
when you're Zach, right?

03:36.150 --> 03:37.816
What were we talking about?
Me.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.301
Really? Gold star, my boy.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.136
Yeah, yeah,
gold star, man.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.655
You know what?
You deserve that.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.690
Aw, that kind of stuff doesn't
really mean anything to me.

03:45.692 --> 03:48.677
It's not like I need a cookie
every time I do something good.

03:48.679 --> 03:50.629
Although, if you're going to the
break room, do you think you...

03:50.631 --> 03:52.363
Cookie, right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Course.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.365
Here's a fun game.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.419
You know what annoying thing
isn't happening right now?

03:57.421 --> 03:59.370
You inviting me to see
opera in the park?

03:59.372 --> 04:00.639
Ah, that ship has sailed.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.590
Your loss, by the way.

04:01.592 --> 04:02.874
It was <i>Der Rosenkavalier,</i>

04:02.876 --> 04:04.726
which is a pants opera...
so-called because a woman

04:04.728 --> 04:06.344
takes on the male lead...
in this case,

04:06.346 --> 04:08.680
a mezzo soprano
played Octavian.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.900
That's stupid.

04:11.902 --> 04:13.401
Anyway, the annoying thing
that isn't happening,

04:13.403 --> 04:15.353
is me having to clean
my stupid desk

04:15.355 --> 04:18.055
because stupid Zach has put
his stupid feet up on it.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.325
Nice George keeps his
nice feet on the floor.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.027
Come on, you miss Zach.
Eh, yeah.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.662
He's just got some
annoying habits.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.864
I'm gonna say it. You
know, a week without Zach

04:25.866 --> 04:27.398
has been a refreshing
change of pace.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.284
I'm not even gonna
feel guilty about it.

04:29.286 --> 04:31.336
Hey, look who's back!
And with gifts for everyone.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.755
And for those of you
who think I got them

04:33.757 --> 04:35.207
at O'Hare Airport,
you couldn't be more wrong.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.459
- I got them at Miami Airport.
- Ooh!

04:37.461 --> 04:39.094
I've hated every second
you've been gone.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.471
Oh, my God, I am so sorry I'm...

04:49.473 --> 04:50.805
47 minutes late.
I've never been so proud.

04:50.807 --> 04:52.774
Owen has been such
a wonderful influence on you.

04:52.776 --> 04:55.610
Where are you two at? Tell, tell, tell.
I want to know everything.

04:55.612 --> 04:56.778
He's awesome.
And he's so talented.

04:56.780 --> 04:58.613
Wait, look at this
picture he took of me.

04:58.615 --> 05:01.399
Ooh! Oh, wait, not that one.
Here, this one.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.767
Whoa, what a wonderful photo.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.653
I've never seen you
look happier.

05:04.655 --> 05:06.437
He's so into you.
He's either gonna marry you

05:06.439 --> 05:07.873
or bury your head
under a bridge.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.140
Oh, I love beginnings.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.625
So, are you two
officially a couple?

05:10.627 --> 05:12.794
Is there an awkward
Thanksgiving in our future?

05:12.796 --> 05:14.713
Maybe. I mean,
it's crazy, you know?

05:14.715 --> 05:16.131
I'm suddenly in this
living-together relationship,

05:16.133 --> 05:18.333
but I still have to be
on first-date behavior.

05:18.335 --> 05:21.253
I have to look my best,
act my best, avoid messy foods.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.453
I mean, if I

05:22.455 --> 05:24.556
had to say one thing
about him...

05:24.558 --> 05:26.658
There it is... there's the seed
that grows into a break-up.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.344
No. Uh... I mean,
it's just that he...

05:29.346 --> 05:31.680
hasn't even started
looking for a job yet.

05:31.682 --> 05:33.298
But I don't mind.
I mean, I kind of

05:33.300 --> 05:35.400
like that he's not all caught up
in the rat race.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.735
My cousin runs a rat race.

05:36.737 --> 05:40.906
Either way, it's not a deal breaker.
You know what?

05:40.908 --> 05:43.358
You're right. This relationship
went from zero to 60 overnight.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.859
The wind is in our hair.

05:44.861 --> 05:46.644
The car is zooming, sister.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.997
We're just adjusting to
it, that's all. Yeah.

05:48.999 --> 05:50.782
It's over, Lauren...
there go my grandkids.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.500
Good-bye, little
Benjamin Simon.

05:52.502 --> 05:53.868
Ciao, Simone Simon.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.820
See you later,
Lou Diamond Simon.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.956
Who knows, maybe
it'll work out for her.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.291
She once broke up with a guy

05:59.293 --> 06:00.642
because he used the phrase,
"awesome sauce."

06:00.644 --> 06:01.960
Right.
That's my daughter.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.379
She obsesses about one
little thing until she blows.

06:04.381 --> 06:06.848
I'm supposed to think a guy
without a job's gonna last?

06:06.850 --> 06:09.117
Oh, well, what are you gonna do, right?
Nothing.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.503
Though, frankly, I'm as emotionally
invested in this as she is.

06:12.505 --> 06:15.640
Basically, she's living with
a guy, and it's working.

06:15.642 --> 06:18.727
When are the stars ever going to
align like this again for us?

06:18.729 --> 06:20.195
Oh...

06:20.197 --> 06:22.614
I can't meddle.
I just can't.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.683
Or can I?

06:25.685 --> 06:27.652
Is my eyebrow going up?

06:27.654 --> 06:28.536
No.

06:28.538 --> 06:30.905
Would you?

06:38.435 --> 06:39.801
I'm still on first-date behavior

06:39.803 --> 06:41.136
at home with Owen.

06:41.138 --> 06:43.638
I haven't had a good slop-burger
in, like, three days.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.006
Oh. It's a medical condition,

06:45.008 --> 06:45.974
really.

06:45.976 --> 06:48.209
I have a very high metabolism.

06:49.896 --> 06:52.731
Holy crap!
He's coming!

06:52.733 --> 06:54.483
May I have your
attention, please?

06:54.485 --> 06:56.768
Everyone, this is

06:56.770 --> 06:58.720
- Owen Winters.
- What is going on?

06:58.722 --> 07:00.539
I don't know. You may
know him as Sydney's

07:00.541 --> 07:02.407
hunky live-in boyfriend,
but he is also

07:02.409 --> 07:06.044
a Peter Parker-level photographer
and our newest employee.

07:07.214 --> 07:09.948
Don't clap
for yourself.

07:11.334 --> 07:12.401
Why would you do this?

07:12.403 --> 07:13.969
- Hmm?
- Do you think I can't handle

07:13.971 --> 07:15.704
- my personal life without your help?
- I wasn't helping <i>you,</i>

07:15.706 --> 07:17.005
I was helping the agency.

07:17.007 --> 07:19.241
He has a very
impressive portfolio.

07:19.243 --> 07:20.643
You saw one picture
on a cell phone.

07:20.644 --> 07:21.510
Come on, admit it,
you're hiring him

07:21.512 --> 07:23.095
because you want
to see me happy.

07:23.097 --> 07:25.247
When you say it out loud,
it does sound evil.

07:25.249 --> 07:26.965
Okay, fine, I was meddling.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.433
I've never meddled before.
I'd like to say

07:28.435 --> 07:29.584
it won't happen again,
but I think

07:29.586 --> 07:31.787
- I've found my inner yenta.
- This is gonna be

07:31.789 --> 07:33.922
a disaster.
You realize I have to be

07:33.924 --> 07:35.140
on first-date behavior 24/7.

07:35.142 --> 07:37.225
Let me ask you this:
When you chat with your friends

07:37.227 --> 07:39.093
on the phone
and they ask what he does,

07:39.095 --> 07:40.262
do you say he's unemployed?

07:40.264 --> 07:41.396
- No. I...
- Mm-hmm.

07:41.398 --> 07:42.931
Act like
I can't hear them, and then

07:42.933 --> 07:45.233
I tell them my carbon monoxide
alarm's going off and I hang up.

07:45.235 --> 07:47.219
- What will you say now? - He's
a photographer. But not one

07:47.221 --> 07:49.604
of those artsy-fartsy ones...
he makes bank.

07:49.606 --> 07:51.540
Okay, maybe this could work.

07:51.542 --> 07:53.575
That's the spirit.
I promise this'll be great.

07:53.577 --> 07:55.177
Say "this'll be great."

07:55.179 --> 07:56.962
This'll be great.

07:56.964 --> 07:57.729
Say it again.

07:57.731 --> 07:58.797
This'll be great?

07:58.799 --> 07:59.614
Let it go.

07:59.616 --> 08:01.266
This'll be great.

08:01.268 --> 08:06.138
Are the needles they use
for permanent makeup painful?

08:06.140 --> 08:10.759
Did you say,
"Was Abraham Lincoln gay?"

08:10.761 --> 08:12.644
Oh!

08:12.646 --> 08:15.514
Dewey, how could you be so...

08:17.066 --> 08:19.151
adorably clumsy?

08:19.153 --> 08:21.186
Instagram!

08:23.273 --> 08:25.357
Don't touch me.

08:25.359 --> 08:28.026
So, let me catch you up.

08:28.028 --> 08:29.194
Yeah.

08:29.196 --> 08:32.145
Accounting wants us to...

08:32.148 --> 08:34.982
start submitting
our hours in the...

08:36.452 --> 08:38.370
I'm gonna let you get that open.

08:38.371 --> 08:41.155
When you're starving,
that is when...

08:41.157 --> 08:43.091
it takes an hour to open.

08:43.092 --> 08:44.860
So, anyway...

08:44.862 --> 08:47.128
Oh...
the time sheet program

08:47.130 --> 08:48.830
is a whole new deal now.

08:48.832 --> 08:49.915
What we're gonna...

08:49.917 --> 08:52.050
I mean, for the love
of Mike Singletary,

08:52.052 --> 08:53.334
do you mind?

08:53.336 --> 08:54.803
What's wrong, bud?
It's just, like,

08:54.805 --> 08:56.671
your feet are on my desk,
you're eating noisy food,

08:56.673 --> 08:58.306
and how starving
can you be when you take

08:58.308 --> 09:00.609
one bite of your sandwich
before throwing it out, bud?

09:00.611 --> 09:03.445
You've never complained
about this stuff before.

09:03.447 --> 09:05.230
Sorry. I'll be honest with you.

09:05.232 --> 09:06.848
While you...
while you were gone,

09:06.850 --> 09:08.900
I was, uh... with someone.

09:08.902 --> 09:10.569
Was it that chick from
the media department,

09:10.571 --> 09:12.537
the one who hides booze
in the copy machine?

09:12.539 --> 09:16.458
No. I mean I worked with another
partner while you were gone.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.192
Oh.

09:18.194 --> 09:20.028
I mean, it wasn't like
I was planning

09:20.030 --> 09:22.380
on working with somebody else;
it just sort of happened.

09:22.382 --> 09:25.050
I was on vacation; I totally get it.
Right, right.

09:26.502 --> 09:28.136
How was it?

09:28.138 --> 09:30.755
Uh, different. You know, not better
or worse; it was just different.

09:30.757 --> 09:32.090
H-How so?
He didn't put

09:32.092 --> 09:34.426
his feet up on the desk,
or eat noisy food.

09:34.428 --> 09:37.679
He complimented me, which is
not something you do so much.

09:37.681 --> 09:39.264
That doesn't sound...

09:39.266 --> 09:41.016
different, that sounds better.

09:41.018 --> 09:43.401
Look, it meant nothing.
Can we just get back to work?

09:43.403 --> 09:44.552
You think that
you're not annoying?

09:44.554 --> 09:45.737
I've clearly touched a nerve.

09:45.739 --> 09:47.239
That was not my intention.
No.

09:47.241 --> 09:49.223
You touch my computer screen
like it's an iPad,

09:49.225 --> 09:50.542
but that doesn't do anything.

09:50.544 --> 09:52.060
Well, you know what,
it does do, it does do

09:52.062 --> 09:54.562
one thing... it...
it really upsets me.

09:54.564 --> 09:56.448
I would never want
to hurt you, okay?

09:56.450 --> 09:59.367
George is just
a surprisingly generous partner.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.369
And I'm not?

10:01.371 --> 10:02.254
No.

10:02.256 --> 10:03.755
The problem here...

10:03.757 --> 10:06.591
is that you have been
with a bunch of partners,

10:06.593 --> 10:08.743
but me, I've only been with you.

10:08.745 --> 10:10.078
Hey, maybe that's a mistake.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.213
So what are you saying? We
should work with other people.

10:12.215 --> 10:14.415
I think that's the best idea you've
ever had. You happy about that idea?

10:14.417 --> 10:15.684
I'm kind of ecstatic about it.

10:15.686 --> 10:17.218
Sounds like a lightbulb to me.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.271
Well, I'm taking back
the Miami Sound Machine!

10:31.485 --> 10:35.370
You don't... mind if I put
my feet up here, do you?

10:35.372 --> 10:36.404
Not at all, bud.

10:36.406 --> 10:37.389
Right on, Rodney.

10:37.391 --> 10:38.840
My name is Peter.

10:40.077 --> 10:41.943
Classic Rodney.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.662
No, really, it's Peter.

10:44.965 --> 10:47.832
I can't get enough
of this bit. Hilarious.

10:49.169 --> 10:52.087
That's my George.
Oh, my gosh.

11:00.488 --> 11:02.822
Did you do this while I was gone?
Yeah.

11:02.824 --> 11:04.907
- Or is Van Gogh temping here today?
- Thanks.

11:04.909 --> 11:06.158
I mean, seriously,

11:06.160 --> 11:08.644
this mock-up... the word
"mock" has no place in it,

11:08.646 --> 11:10.963
okay, because nobody
could possibly mock this!

11:10.965 --> 11:12.331
Thanks.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.633
And this color.
This color.

11:13.635 --> 11:14.800
I've-I've never
seen it before.

11:14.802 --> 11:16.168
Did you invent this color?

11:16.170 --> 11:19.455
- Yeah. Call it green. Are you
screwing with me? - What?

11:19.457 --> 11:21.591
It's just... it's a little much
with the compliments.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.259
I'm not sure
I deserve all that.

11:25.396 --> 11:26.762
And he's modest, too.

11:26.764 --> 11:27.847
Yeah, I know. We could...

11:27.849 --> 11:29.515
we could definitely
cool it on the compliments.

11:29.517 --> 11:30.966
It's, uh... it's...
it's all right.

11:30.968 --> 11:32.602
- Sure. Sure.
- Thanks, man.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.570
Yeah, no, uh...
message received.

11:34.572 --> 11:36.322
- Totally appreciate it.
- No problem.

11:36.324 --> 11:38.357
Okay.

11:43.747 --> 11:45.081
You okay?

11:45.083 --> 11:47.083
You seem a little, like, tense.

11:47.085 --> 11:48.200
Tense? Why would I be tense?

11:48.202 --> 11:49.818
I don't know.

11:49.820 --> 11:52.672
Maybe 'cause
you're missing these.

11:52.674 --> 11:54.507
Okay.

11:54.509 --> 11:57.209
The reason that you found
that pack of cigarettes is...

11:57.211 --> 11:59.128
23 packs of cigarettes.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.130
23 packs of cigarettes is...

12:01.132 --> 12:03.332
Look, I get it.
You're a super hard-core smoker.

12:03.334 --> 12:05.685
But the company that makes these
is not messing around.

12:05.687 --> 12:06.835
These are unfiltered.

12:06.837 --> 12:08.471
The tar content's
through the roof.

12:08.473 --> 12:09.989
And there's a recipe
on the back

12:09.991 --> 12:11.390
for something
called a nicotini.

12:11.392 --> 12:13.693
No, the reason I had to buy
those is to use the bathroom

12:13.695 --> 12:15.061
in a tobacco store
because I'm not comfortable

12:15.063 --> 12:16.445
using the bathroom
in front of you.

12:16.447 --> 12:17.613
Good, we found her.

12:17.615 --> 12:19.014
This looks like
a private moment.

12:19.016 --> 12:19.899
Yeah, it does.

12:19.901 --> 12:21.484
Why would you be uncomfortable

12:21.486 --> 12:23.302
using the bathroom in your own house?
Come on, it's unnatural

12:23.304 --> 12:25.454
as it is, us living together
the night we met.

12:25.456 --> 12:26.822
I mean, you know hard it is

12:26.824 --> 12:28.574
to keep up any mystery
under those circumstances?

12:28.576 --> 12:29.592
I don't care about mystery.

12:29.594 --> 12:30.710
Oh, yeah, all guys say that,

12:30.712 --> 12:32.078
and then,
your cat bats around one tampon

12:32.080 --> 12:33.879
out of the garbage can,
and all of a sudden,

12:33.881 --> 12:35.298
"It's not you, it's me."

12:35.300 --> 12:37.750
What people don't realize is,
the cat is giving you a gift.

12:37.752 --> 12:39.168
It's actually kind of sweet,
if you think about it.

12:39.170 --> 12:40.720
You know what?
I can't hide

12:40.722 --> 12:41.921
who I am anymore.

12:41.923 --> 12:43.139
I'm not always camera ready.

12:43.141 --> 12:44.674
Do you know how many hours
it takes me

12:44.676 --> 12:45.758
to look this effortless?

12:45.760 --> 12:47.343
And during
those countless hours,

12:47.345 --> 12:49.979
all I've been doing is dreaming
about eating something sloppy

12:49.981 --> 12:51.797
and messy and saucy and sloppy.

12:51.799 --> 12:54.480
You said sloppy twice. Because that's
how badly I want that hot dog.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.187
Ooh.
Oh. Oh, man.

12:58.189 --> 12:59.855
Oh!

12:59.857 --> 13:01.557
And in case it's not obvious,
I am not chill.

13:01.559 --> 13:02.692
I don't take chill pills,

13:02.694 --> 13:03.892
although I did take
a Lorazepam this morning,

13:03.894 --> 13:05.027
and it is not helping.

13:05.029 --> 13:07.013
Okay. I wet the
bed till I was 12.

13:07.015 --> 13:09.098
I've put down people who drink
Starbucks as silly yuppies,

13:09.100 --> 13:10.733
but the truth is,
I love their coffee,

13:10.735 --> 13:12.018
and it's where I get all my CDs.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.836
Oh, and that thunderstorm
we listened to the other night?

13:13.838 --> 13:14.954
I was scared.

13:14.956 --> 13:16.839
Like five-year-old-girl-level
scared.

13:16.841 --> 13:19.709
It's electricity in the sky!

13:19.711 --> 13:21.827
You still buy CDs?

13:21.829 --> 13:23.579
See, honesty is
key to a relationship.

13:23.581 --> 13:25.514
None of us are perfect, right?

13:25.516 --> 13:27.383
You know, I snore.
I've got dancers' feet.

13:27.385 --> 13:29.652
I've been naked on every
table on this office.

13:29.654 --> 13:31.904
Yeah. I do feel better.

13:31.906 --> 13:34.640
Mm. I won't be
touching any surfaces.

13:34.642 --> 13:36.192
And I should, uh,
probably mention,

13:36.194 --> 13:38.794
I'm also arachnophobic,
claustrophobic and pedophobic.

13:38.796 --> 13:40.162
Okay.

13:40.164 --> 13:43.532
Um, spiders, tight spaces,
but pedophobic?

13:43.534 --> 13:45.067
- Fear of babies. - Oh,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:45.069 --> 13:46.902
It's not fear of babies.
It's fear of feet.

13:46.904 --> 13:48.320
No, no, I'm good with feet.

13:48.322 --> 13:50.239
As long as it's not baby feet.

13:50.241 --> 13:52.541
So I guess I'm pedopedaphobic.

13:52.543 --> 13:54.243
You know what?

13:54.245 --> 13:57.313
I am living with a freak,

13:57.315 --> 13:59.448
and it's not even
a deal breaker.

14:01.284 --> 14:03.386
Owen's afraid of babies.
That's a deal breaker.

14:03.388 --> 14:05.621
Says here the only cure for
pedophobia is immersion therapy.

14:05.623 --> 14:07.790
If only I had a group
of cute little babies

14:07.792 --> 14:10.426
in cute little outfits I could
throw Owen in the middle of.

14:11.596 --> 14:12.762
Huh?

14:17.200 --> 14:20.069
This looks like a job for...

14:20.071 --> 14:21.804
the Meddler.

14:22.806 --> 14:24.690
Yeah.

14:30.822 --> 14:32.038
Babies.

14:33.425 --> 14:34.758
Why did it have to be babies?

14:34.760 --> 14:36.960
Son, back in the
'80s, I had this

14:36.962 --> 14:38.511
crippling fear of open spaces.

14:38.513 --> 14:40.597
- Agoraphobia?
- No. Paranoia brought on

14:40.599 --> 14:41.848
by massive amounts of coke.

14:41.850 --> 14:43.666
The pedophobia experts...
both of them...

14:43.668 --> 14:45.602
say this is the way
you kick this thing.

14:45.604 --> 14:47.003
You've gotta confront
your fear, son.

14:47.005 --> 14:50.340
Trust me, he is more afraid
of you than you are of him.

14:50.342 --> 14:53.026
Come on, get in there, pal.
Yeah?

14:54.980 --> 14:56.363
Oh, God.

14:56.365 --> 14:57.680
Aah! Come on, you can do this.

14:57.682 --> 14:58.848
Okay.

14:58.850 --> 15:00.516
Yeah, so blue.

15:00.518 --> 15:02.685
It's a blue bear.
So blue.

15:04.473 --> 15:05.538
Messy blue bear... this one...

15:05.540 --> 15:06.489
uh, this one's broken.

15:06.491 --> 15:08.825
Can somebody give it a grape?

15:08.827 --> 15:10.243
Dad, why is Owen shooting this?

15:10.245 --> 15:12.362
Ann Geddes is in the lobby,
taking a nap in someone's hand.

15:12.364 --> 15:13.713
We don't need Ann.

15:13.715 --> 15:15.215
Afraid of babies? Pshaw.
He's fantastic with babies!

15:15.217 --> 15:16.699
Look at him. Look at him.
He's just...

15:16.701 --> 15:18.468
Oh, another one. Hi.

15:18.470 --> 15:19.719
Oh, a brown one.

15:19.721 --> 15:22.188
Uh, this one's moving!

15:22.190 --> 15:24.074
I think this one came unstapled!

15:24.076 --> 15:25.225
Okay, I'm waking Ann up.
No, no, no, no.

15:25.227 --> 15:27.310
- Just give him more time.
- Oh, no.

15:27.312 --> 15:30.196
You know what? If-If you have
somebody else, really, it's...

15:30.198 --> 15:32.098
not a big...
No, get back in there! No, no.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.650
He just needs more time to
fall in love with babies.

15:33.652 --> 15:35.718
Why?

15:35.720 --> 15:37.053
Oh, my God, you're pregnant.

15:37.055 --> 15:39.155
Keep it. We'll raise
it as an agency.

15:39.157 --> 15:41.074
I'm not pregnant!
We've been dating a week.

15:41.076 --> 15:42.692
Then why are we
talking about babies?

15:42.694 --> 15:44.411
Because it's important for you
to think about your future.

15:44.413 --> 15:45.945
I've thought about my future.
There's this island in France

15:45.947 --> 15:47.914
where everybody lives to be,
like, over 100 years old.

15:47.916 --> 15:49.399
It's something in the water,

15:49.401 --> 15:50.917
or the wine... they don't
really know... but if you ask me,

15:50.919 --> 15:52.869
it's kind of a no-brainer.
I think everybody in the world

15:52.871 --> 15:54.404
should move there,
so, that's my future.

15:54.406 --> 15:55.705
Oh, come on, there'll be
babies on that island.

15:55.707 --> 15:57.123
You've got to get over this.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.376
Hey, take a shot
of this little guy.

15:59.378 --> 16:01.011
Spider baby!

16:01.013 --> 16:02.178
Hey.

16:02.180 --> 16:04.347
Spider baby!

16:06.684 --> 16:08.134
Hey.

16:09.587 --> 16:11.688
Remember that time when
you and Andrew were trying

16:11.690 --> 16:13.223
to flick those into
each other's mouths,

16:13.225 --> 16:14.724
and you hit him in the eye,

16:14.726 --> 16:16.142
and he got a cataract
from the trauma,

16:16.144 --> 16:17.861
and had to get laser surgery?

16:17.863 --> 16:20.113
Hmm. Almost forgot about that.

16:21.316 --> 16:22.615
Oh. Memories.

16:22.617 --> 16:24.701
You know what
might cheer you up?

16:24.703 --> 16:26.769
Have you ever been
to a rat race?

16:26.771 --> 16:28.872
They're surprisingly fast.

16:30.124 --> 16:31.825
Look, it's...

16:31.827 --> 16:33.326
I haven't been able
to find that magic

16:33.328 --> 16:34.861
I had with Andrew
with anyone else,

16:34.863 --> 16:37.180
and I've tried.
I hate to admit this, but...

16:37.182 --> 16:40.884
monogamy works best for me.

16:40.886 --> 16:42.886
With Andrew. Working.

16:42.888 --> 16:44.087
At work.
Not in my personal life.

16:44.089 --> 16:45.555
Right here. Are you kidding?
Can you imagine me?

16:45.557 --> 16:46.622
No.
Hello. Hey, honey.

16:46.624 --> 16:48.341
I'm home.

16:48.343 --> 16:51.845
Oh. You do know Andrew
and George are pitching

16:51.847 --> 16:53.763
JetSky Airlines,
like, right now.

16:53.765 --> 16:54.765
If JetSky buys the pitch,

16:54.766 --> 16:56.466
Andrew will be
on the account with George

16:56.468 --> 16:58.768
for a long time.

16:58.770 --> 17:00.103
How do you? Welcome.

17:00.105 --> 17:01.354
Welcome.

17:01.356 --> 17:03.490
He started this.
I can't make the first move.

17:03.492 --> 17:06.192
Ugh, men. You need
to get it together.

17:06.194 --> 17:07.527
Otherwise, at the
end of the day,

17:07.529 --> 17:10.380
you'll both just be miserable.

17:10.382 --> 17:11.164
Yeah?

17:11.165 --> 17:12.549
Yeah.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.021
I have to stop that pitch.

17:19.023 --> 17:20.205
Go.

17:20.208 --> 17:21.624
Go to him!

Why shouldn't I?

17:49.905 --> 17:52.071
Because I don't want
to be with anyone else.

17:52.073 --> 17:54.240
When I first started,

17:54.242 --> 17:55.875
I asked Simon,
"Who's the best art guy?

17:55.877 --> 17:57.377
That's who I want to work with."

17:58.579 --> 18:00.380
You make me better every day.

18:00.382 --> 18:03.082
Hey, look, I-I've put a lot
into this thing with George,

18:03.084 --> 18:05.034
and it wouldn't be right
to abandon him.

18:06.721 --> 18:09.222
I understand.

18:09.224 --> 18:11.174

18:17.899 --> 18:19.899
We're gonna go ahead
and close the doors now,

18:19.901 --> 18:20.984
because the pitch
is about to start.

18:28.742 --> 18:31.494
Andrew...?

18:31.496 --> 18:33.112
Look, I'm sorry, George.

18:33.114 --> 18:35.365
I wish you all the luck
in the world,

18:35.367 --> 18:36.616
but I'm going with Zach.

18:38.919 --> 18:40.920
Wow. I, uh...

18:40.922 --> 18:43.072
I didn't see that one coming.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.093
But, uh, you know,
you were just gracious.

18:47.095 --> 18:49.429
And is it weird to write a
thank you note to someone

18:49.431 --> 18:50.763
who just broke up with you?
Good-bye, George.

18:50.765 --> 18:52.632
Yeah.

18:52.634 --> 18:55.802
So, are you still going
to put your feet up on my desk?

18:55.804 --> 18:58.438
And eat messy food,
and make fun of your hair.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.440
You make fun of my hair?

19:00.442 --> 19:02.225
Feel like we gave it
a pretty good go, right?

19:02.227 --> 19:05.478
Yeah... we just want
different things.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.762
It usually takes a while
to figure that out,

19:06.764 --> 19:08.281
but when you spend as much time
together as we have,

19:08.283 --> 19:09.482
you figure it out
kind of quickly.

19:09.484 --> 19:10.650
If you add up

19:10.652 --> 19:11.901
the hours we spent together,

19:11.903 --> 19:13.703
this is my longest relationship
in, like, ten years.

19:13.705 --> 19:15.388
Me, too.

19:15.390 --> 19:19.075
Okay. Well, um,

19:19.077 --> 19:20.326
oh, hey, I have some great ideas

19:20.328 --> 19:21.911
about rearranging
your furniture, but,

19:21.913 --> 19:23.379
well, I'll-I'll just
see you at home.

19:23.381 --> 19:25.415
Um, Owen, uh...

19:25.417 --> 19:27.950
you know you have
to move out, right?

19:27.952 --> 19:30.286
Oh. Yeah, no, right,
yeah, of course.

19:30.288 --> 19:31.888
I just...
I didn't want to assume.

19:33.918 --> 19:35.558
See you bright and early
at work tomorrow!

19:35.560 --> 19:39.429
Um... you also know that this...

19:39.431 --> 19:40.897
I'm messing with you.

19:40.899 --> 19:44.767
Right. Yeah. I knew that.
Mm-hmm.

19:44.769 --> 19:46.469
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to find a friend

19:46.471 --> 19:47.654
with a couch I can crash on

19:47.656 --> 19:49.472
where there are no
tight spaces, babies

19:49.474 --> 19:50.857
or spiders.

19:50.859 --> 19:52.742
Oh, and that's on
the ground level.

19:52.744 --> 19:54.577
What, you're acrophobic, too?

19:54.579 --> 19:56.279
We're on the fifteenth floor.

19:56.281 --> 19:58.698
That's how much
I liked you, babe.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.284
<i>Well, he was
definitely the sexiest</i>

20:01.286 --> 20:02.502
scaredy-cat I ever dated.

20:02.504 --> 20:03.770
Well, I'm sorry it's over.

20:03.772 --> 20:05.588
And that I meddled.

20:05.590 --> 20:06.673
No, it's fine.

20:06.675 --> 20:07.740
It's just, I have a good life.

20:07.742 --> 20:08.958
I feel like
I have it all, except...

20:08.960 --> 20:10.543
- No, except grandkids.
- No.

20:10.545 --> 20:12.996
I mean, sure, I'd love
to have grandkids one day,

20:12.998 --> 20:14.180
but what I really wanted

20:14.182 --> 20:15.848
was for you to have it all.

20:17.101 --> 20:18.451
I love seeing you happy.

20:18.453 --> 20:20.336
Well, let's be honest...
we all knew from the start

20:20.338 --> 20:21.971
that Owen was not
the right one for me.

20:21.973 --> 20:23.506
Yeah.
But it was fun.

20:23.508 --> 20:26.209
Mm-hmm. Until it wasn't.
I did love seeing

20:26.211 --> 20:27.794
how happy my being
with Owen made you.

20:27.796 --> 20:31.042
- Well, aren't we just the selfless pair?
- Apparently so.

20:37.188 --> 20:39.711
That's a full head of hair.
Kid's got sideburns.

20:39.743 --> 20:41.044
That's weird.

20:41.076 --> 20:43.626
The kid's got sideburns.

20:44.663 --> 20:46.796
As much as it sounds

20:46.798 --> 20:48.047
- better...
- Tomato, "potahto."

20:48.049 --> 20:49.248
Look, let's get back to work.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.751
It didn't mean anything.

20:51.753 --> 20:52.819
Potato, "tomahto."

20:55.206 --> 20:56.306
Matthew...

20:56.308 --> 20:58.007
Yeah!
Yeah!
