[tires squealing]
[horns blaring]

00:17.896 --> 00:19.862
[Tasha]
We're sold a lie from birth.

00:19.965 --> 00:22.241
[tires squealing]
[tense music]

00:22.655 --> 00:26.068
The idea that there are
good people and bad people.

00:26.137 --> 00:28.724
[horns blaring]

00:28.827 --> 00:30.620
But there aren't.

00:30.965 --> 00:33.793
We all have the best of
intentions.

00:34.310 --> 00:35.551

00:41.931 --> 00:43.586
[Bystander]  We need some
help!

00:44.172 --> 00:46.586
[Tasha] Love can justify almost
anything.

00:47.413 --> 00:49.241
[siren wailing]

00:49.586 --> 00:51.344
If you believe in it hard
enough.

00:53.482 --> 00:55.482
[explosion booms]

00:55.620 --> 00:58.758
It can make us all do
terrible things.

[melancholy music]

01:14.137 --> 01:18.448
[phone ringing]

01:39.758 --> 01:41.551
Hey you.

01:45.896 --> 01:47.344
Jack?

01:47.482 --> 01:48.689
Yeah, coming.

01:50.034 --> 01:51.827
No, of course. Of course.

01:53.137 --> 01:55.103
[melancholy music]

01:58.137 --> 01:59.931
No, I understand.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.448
No, she'll be fine.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.241
She'll be fine.

02:06.310 --> 02:07.379
It'll be fine.

02:09.137 --> 02:10.379
I'll make it fine.

02:10.517 --> 02:12.275
Just leave it up to me.

02:12.793 --> 02:14.965
[melancholy music]

02:17.517 --> 02:19.379
Yeah, no. I'll tell her myself.

02:21.379 --> 02:24.103
No, I think I'll wait and
tell her in the morning.

02:26.620 --> 02:29.655
Because tonight's our
wedding anniversary, Jen.

02:32.206 --> 02:33.896
No, not ours.
Mine and Tasha's.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.206
[Tasha laughs]

02:37.655 --> 02:38.620
All right. Yeah.

02:38.689 --> 02:40.137
You know?

02:40.241 --> 02:42.000
No, I appreciate the call.

02:43.517 --> 02:44.896
All right. Okay.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.689
I'm going now.
Bye bye.

02:48.275 --> 02:50.482
- You don't wanna know.
- I do. Tell me.

02:50.551 --> 02:51.793
Look at this.

02:52.379 --> 02:54.793
What have I done to deserve
this?

03:01.275 --> 03:02.689
Emily's asleep.

03:03.931 --> 03:06.620
One story. Milk. Conked out.

03:09.517 --> 03:10.724
So what was she saying?

03:10.827 --> 03:12.448
[melancholy music]

03:12.724 --> 03:14.275
She called about my sister.

03:15.137 --> 03:16.931
- Hayley?
- Mm-hm.

03:17.310 --> 03:18.448
A heads up.

03:18.517 --> 03:20.206
Wine first, I think.

03:20.620 --> 03:22.724
Oh, a heads up...
Tonight.

03:23.931 --> 03:26.206
She knows exactly
when we got married, Jack.

03:26.310 --> 03:27.310
Trust me.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.827
So what was she saying about
Hayley?

03:37.620 --> 03:40.620
Well, apparently she wants
us to be Ethan's godparents.

03:41.931 --> 03:43.827
Oh, wow. That's so nice.

03:45.275 --> 03:46.344
No, sorry.

03:47.172 --> 03:50.344
Me and Jen - she wants me and
Jen to be Ethan's godparents.

03:50.448 --> 03:52.241
- Hence the heads up.
- Oh yeah.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.413
Wait, your sister wants
you and your ex-wife

03:58.517 --> 04:00.620
to be her only child's
godparents?

04:04.068 --> 04:05.206
And I'm...

04:06.310 --> 04:07.931
You're Auntie Tash.

04:09.931 --> 04:11.551
They definitely want you there.

04:11.655 --> 04:15.310
It's just Jen and Hayley have
been best friends for 20 years.

04:18.275 --> 04:19.068
All right.

04:20.103 --> 04:21.068
Okay. Okay.

04:21.310 --> 04:23.793
[melancholy music]

04:31.655 --> 04:35.517
I know it's not the most
glamorous wedding anniversary
gift

04:35.965 --> 04:38.448
and I know you hate
receiving handouts.

04:40.896 --> 04:43.000
It's always in the back of your
head.

04:44.448 --> 04:45.827
Now it's gone.

04:46.689 --> 04:48.724
[Tasha] The rest of my student
loan.

04:48.931 --> 04:51.448
[melancholy music]

05:03.655 --> 05:05.758
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.896
[tense music]

05:21.379 --> 05:23.896
[tense music]

05:52.586 --> 05:53.655
- Fuck!

05:53.724 --> 05:54.862
Fucking idiots.

05:54.931 --> 05:57.034
Thanks for all your fucking
help.. Nice one.

05:57.103 --> 05:57.931
[baby crying]

05:58.275 --> 06:00.103
I said you needed a criminal
lawyer, not a media one.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.551
Why didn't you hammer home
the mitigating circumstances.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.034
That's all you needed to...
Oh.

06:04.137 --> 06:06.103
Didn't do mitigating
because they didn't play well.

06:06.172 --> 06:08.413
How would bringing that up
have helped us?

06:08.482 --> 06:11.000
I don't know. You're the one
arguing the case, not me.

06:11.068 --> 06:13.344
Now I can't even drive
my wife and child home.

06:13.413 --> 06:14.413
So thank you.

06:14.482 --> 06:16.551
Look what you've done to my
baby, prick.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.482
[baby crying]

06:18.689 --> 06:20.448
- Look.
- Well, I gotta dash, mate.

06:20.517 --> 06:22.482
We'll talk later, yeah?
Still on for climbing Friday?

06:22.586 --> 06:23.586
- Yeah, of course.

06:23.793 --> 06:25.689
[baby crying]

06:26.034 --> 06:27.172
Lola?

06:27.482 --> 06:29.862
Yeah. Could you get someone
from the office to pick me up
please?

06:29.931 --> 06:31.689
- Let's go!
- Yeah, anybody who's free.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.931
Yes, they banned me for three
years.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.586
[baby coos, Lola humms]

06:41.275 --> 06:42.344
Ssh!

06:45.896 --> 06:47.827
[Jack]  Tasha? Jen's here.

06:49.310 --> 06:50.310
Oh God.

06:50.551 --> 06:52.551
[gentle music]

06:52.655 --> 06:53.965
[Tasha]  Look! Look!

06:55.310 --> 06:57.827
It'd Daddy's ex-wife...
Again.

06:59.413 --> 07:00.689
[lock chirps]

07:00.862 --> 07:02.103
[gentle music]

07:02.310 --> 07:06.000
Who's afraid of the big, bad
wolf?

07:06.137 --> 07:07.137
The big bad...

07:07.931 --> 07:10.000
[gentle music]

07:12.551 --> 07:15.448
- [Jack]  Hey.
- [Jen]  You smell fabulous.

07:16.275 --> 07:17.586
[Jen]  Wait, did I buy you
that?

07:17.655 --> 07:18.793
- [Jack]  Probably.

07:19.344 --> 07:20.896
[Jen]  I brought your
favorite.

07:21.206 --> 07:23.965
Oh, I haven't had this in ages.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.413
This is fancy. Thank you.

07:26.724 --> 07:28.586
- Thank you so much.
- I knew you'd love it.

07:28.655 --> 07:29.482
You love your reds.

07:29.586 --> 07:30.724
Hi. How's it going?

07:30.862 --> 07:32.724
Hi. How are you?

07:34.517 --> 07:36.068
[Jen] Oh, you poor thing.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.310
A three-year driving ban?

07:39.137 --> 07:40.586
God, that's outrageous.

07:41.137 --> 07:42.965
And Tasha can't drive either,
can she?

07:43.206 --> 07:44.172
Oh, I can drive.

07:44.344 --> 07:45.793
I just, I don't have a license.

07:47.103 --> 07:48.689
Wait, Jack, how are you
gonna get to the christening?

07:48.965 --> 07:50.310
- We'll just get the train.

07:50.931 --> 07:52.517
The train on a Sunday?

07:52.758 --> 07:54.275
Jack hates the train.

07:54.482 --> 07:56.413
Plus the station is nowhere
near the church.

07:56.827 --> 07:58.793
Well, I guess we'll have to
rethink going then.

07:59.413 --> 08:03.862
Or Jack, maybe you can go and
I'll just stay behind here with
Emily.

08:03.931 --> 08:05.620
No, no.

08:05.827 --> 08:07.793
Then Jack's mum and dad
will miss out.

08:07.896 --> 08:09.793
God, they'll be heartbroken
if they don't get a squeeze.

08:11.068 --> 08:13.206
Listen, why don't I just
drive us all?

08:13.517 --> 08:14.758
I mean, I've certainly got the
space.

08:16.551 --> 08:17.551
Problem solved.

08:21.241 --> 08:22.620
[traffic whooshing]

08:22.793 --> 08:25.206
[Jen]  You know the church
we're going to is where I was
christened?

08:25.275 --> 08:26.689
- [Jack] Seriously?
- [Jen] Yeah.

08:26.793 --> 08:28.034
- [Jack] Do you think
they still remember you?

08:28.103 --> 08:29.482
It was such a long time ago.

08:29.586 --> 08:32.034
Hey, we're practically the same
age.

08:32.896 --> 08:34.482
Oh, this is gonna be so fun.

08:34.655 --> 08:37.034
And I have the perfect
playlist.

08:37.103 --> 08:38.689
Oh God. Brace yourselves.

08:38.862 --> 08:40.275
You remember this song, right?

08:40.344 --> 08:41.965
- Oh shit!
- Yes!

08:42.137 --> 08:44.241
- Do you remember when we were
in that beach bar in Mykonos?

08:44.310 --> 08:45.862
- This is all they played.
- Yes.

08:45.931 --> 08:47.448
[Jack] They only had one CD,
I'm sure of it.

08:47.862 --> 08:49.137
[Jen] Of course I remember.

08:49.206 --> 08:51.172
And the waitress who
kept dropping our drinks.

08:51.275 --> 08:52.517
[Jack] Oh yeah!

08:53.172 --> 08:54.482
And you wondered why
I didn't tip her.

08:54.551 --> 08:55.758
Oh, she was so sweet.

08:55.931 --> 08:58.068
Absolutely ruined your
shirt though. Remember?

09:02.241 --> 09:04.827
Listen, you know how my dad
loves a little dance.

09:04.896 --> 09:07.517
- Yes.
- He will probably wanna...

09:08.482 --> 09:12.241
[bright music and voices
mumbling]

09:18.551 --> 09:21.896
[upbeat music]

09:32.586 --> 09:33.793
[phone ringing]

09:34.206 --> 09:35.034
Hello?

09:35.379 --> 09:36.620
[Sam] Any news?

09:37.655 --> 09:39.000
Sam, the interview was last
week.

09:39.068 --> 09:41.206
They're not gonna give me a
full-time position that
quickly.

09:41.275 --> 09:42.103
Why?

09:42.620 --> 09:45.310
'Cause it is a proper job
with proper grownups

09:45.413 --> 09:46.586
and proper grownup money.

09:46.689 --> 09:47.862
- Okay.

09:47.965 --> 09:49.655
I mean, I'm no employment guru,

09:49.724 --> 09:52.517
but I'd say probably don't
tell people at the coffee shop

09:52.586 --> 09:54.034
you think it's a fake job?

09:54.137 --> 09:56.931
Or you'll end up like me,
gaming in your boxers.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.896
Yeah. You're living your
best life though, right?

09:58.965 --> 10:00.620
Continue.
See you tonight.

10:00.724 --> 10:01.827
Yes. Okay. Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.137
All right, later.

10:04.551 --> 10:05.896
[traffic whooshing]

10:06.344 --> 10:07.413
[tires squeal]

10:08.241 --> 10:09.344
[body thuds]

10:09.413 --> 10:11.586
[ears ring]

10:13.241 --> 10:14.655
[Jack] You okay?

10:15.310 --> 10:16.620
Can you hear me?

10:16.689 --> 10:17.758
Can you hear me?

10:17.965 --> 10:19.206
Call an ambulance.

10:19.482 --> 10:20.793
Oh, no, I'm okay. I'm fine.

10:22.827 --> 10:24.517
[Tasha pants]

10:24.620 --> 10:26.413
- Actually, I've gotta get to
work. - No, no.

10:26.482 --> 10:28.068
I don't think you should move.
You might have a back injury.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.241
No, I'm pretty sure I don't.

10:30.310 --> 10:32.137
I'm so sorry. I didn't see.

10:32.241 --> 10:33.551
You popped out nowhere and...

10:33.655 --> 10:34.965
Yeah. Alright. Alright.

10:36.517 --> 10:39.000
If you can move, we should
probably get you off the road.

10:39.482 --> 10:40.586
- Yep.
- Come on.

10:40.758 --> 10:42.620
Here, let me help.
Let me help you up.

10:42.965 --> 10:44.172
Thank you.

10:44.241 --> 10:45.689
You all right?
Can you walk?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.103
Yeah.

10:47.379 --> 10:48.655
Can you walk?

10:49.448 --> 10:51.206
- Do you want an arm?
- No.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.172
[gentle music]

10:54.620 --> 10:56.068
Fuck's sake.

10:58.068 --> 10:59.379
[sighs]

10:59.517 --> 11:01.655
- Here.
- Thanks.

11:05.379 --> 11:06.862
You don't have the time, do
you?

11:07.206 --> 11:08.379
- 10:17.

11:08.724 --> 11:10.000
[gentle music]

11:10.103 --> 11:12.000
- Why? Work?
- Yeah.

11:13.344 --> 11:16.517
Well, I can call them
and explain everything.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.655
Okay. Yeah, actually that'd be
really good, thank you.

11:19.758 --> 11:21.689
- Okay.
- Fuck...

11:23.655 --> 11:25.310
Sorry. Do you mind just...

11:25.413 --> 11:26.827
Oh, yeah. Okay.

11:27.793 --> 11:29.413
Ah, fuck!

11:30.137 --> 11:31.310
Ah.

11:32.034 --> 11:34.000
[gentle music]

11:35.896 --> 11:37.862
Do I have to get this
checked out or...

11:39.448 --> 11:41.413
- No, it just needs cleaning,
that's all.

11:41.517 --> 11:44.241
Listen, I live 15 minutes that
way.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.068
So if you like, I'm happy to...

11:47.965 --> 11:49.827
I'll get you fixed up.
I'll put that in the boot.

11:49.931 --> 11:51.517
I'll get that fixed up.

11:52.137 --> 11:53.827
I'll throw in a cup of tea
and a taxi home if you like.

11:56.965 --> 11:58.172
- Okay. Okay. Yeah.
- Sure?

11:58.241 --> 11:59.241
- Thank you. Yeah.

11:59.965 --> 12:01.862
[gentle music]

12:03.551 --> 12:06.241
[car whooshing]

12:13.344 --> 12:14.896
[keys jingling]

12:15.482 --> 12:17.137
kay. Come on in.

12:17.310 --> 12:22.448
I think I've got a first-aid
kit... somewhere.

12:23.517 --> 12:25.448
[gentle music]

12:37.275 --> 12:38.206
Not bad.

12:40.206 --> 12:41.103
Thank you.

12:41.172 --> 12:43.068
Here.
I'll leave this here for you.

12:43.724 --> 12:46.000
- Tea?
- Yeah, please.

12:47.137 --> 12:49.586
[gentle music]

12:52.379 --> 12:54.931
[tap whooshes]

12:58.103 --> 12:59.551
You all right there?

13:03.896 --> 13:04.827
Here.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
All right?

13:08.344 --> 13:09.344
Milk?

13:10.137 --> 13:11.275
Yes, please.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.862
[gentle music]

13:18.862 --> 13:19.931
That's the fridge.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.965
[Tasha laughs]

13:23.206 --> 13:24.206
Sorry.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.586
[gentle music]

13:26.689 --> 13:28.137
[Tasha laughs]

13:30.448 --> 13:33.655
So listen. I'm happy to pay
for your bike to get repaired.

13:33.758 --> 13:36.586
Or if you prefer,
I can just give you cash.

13:36.655 --> 13:38.068
You could get a new one.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.241
Is 400 quid...

13:40.655 --> 13:41.862
I dunno how much they cost.

13:41.931 --> 13:43.620
What about my smashed phone?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.448
Cost like a grand.

13:47.275 --> 13:48.517
Did it?

13:48.965 --> 13:50.137
No, not really.

13:50.241 --> 13:51.517
It's refurbished.

13:52.896 --> 13:54.896
800 will cover everything.

13:55.448 --> 13:56.758
That'll do.

13:57.931 --> 13:58.896
Here.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.655
No, come on.

14:05.241 --> 14:06.793
We start with this.

14:09.206 --> 14:10.241
Here we go.

14:10.862 --> 14:12.517
[gentle music]

14:13.000 --> 14:14.344
It's gonna sting.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.620
Doesn't sting?

14:16.862 --> 14:18.000
[Tasha laughs]

14:19.448 --> 14:20.655
Is that your wife?

14:22.482 --> 14:23.896
Yep. That's Jen.

14:24.103 --> 14:25.448
[gentle music]

14:26.931 --> 14:28.241
She's very young.

14:28.344 --> 14:29.517
We both were.

14:31.517 --> 14:32.620
Here, swap.

14:32.965 --> 14:35.172
[gentle music]

14:37.344 --> 14:39.413
[traffic whooshing]

14:40.172 --> 14:41.551
[steam hissing]

14:42.965 --> 14:44.241
[Tasha]  Hello?

14:45.206 --> 14:47.034
[Jack]  How are the war
wounds?

14:48.655 --> 14:49.827
Hey.

14:49.896 --> 14:52.068
Yeah, they're healing up
nicely. Thanks.

14:52.586 --> 14:54.241
Good, good.

14:56.068 --> 15:00.965
Listen, I've got a meeting in
town, but I should be done by
about 6:00.

15:01.896 --> 15:07.137
So if you're free, we could
get an early dinner maybe.

15:08.103 --> 15:11.000
As a thank you. or a sorry.

15:11.275 --> 15:12.965
[gentle music]

15:13.862 --> 15:16.000
I've gotta check on that arm,
haven't I?

15:16.827 --> 15:17.655
Okay.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.793
This is just a sorry, right?

15:21.103 --> 15:22.206
Of course.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.413
[gentle music and people
chattering]

15:30.310 --> 15:35.965
[Jack] So graphic design... I
know what it is, but what is
it?

15:36.724 --> 15:38.862
It's an umbrella term, really.

15:38.965 --> 15:42.724
But personally I'm into
pictographs or pictograms.

15:43.448 --> 15:47.241
And so now pretend that
I have absolutely no idea

15:47.344 --> 15:48.793
what you're talking about.

15:48.862 --> 15:50.689
They're images that we all
agree on.

15:50.793 --> 15:56.068
Like road signs or...
labels or... warnings.

15:56.448 --> 15:57.724
[gentle music]

15:57.827 --> 16:00.241
Their meaning has to be
crystal clear,

16:00.931 --> 16:03.758
unambiguous, purely functional.

16:05.206 --> 16:07.655
And, right. And you like that?

16:08.586 --> 16:10.000
What? Functionality?

16:11.379 --> 16:12.862
Lack of ambiguity.

16:13.137 --> 16:15.344
[gentle music]

16:16.172 --> 16:17.482
Yeah. I do.

16:18.551 --> 16:21.000
[patrons chattering]

16:21.896 --> 16:23.034
Noted.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.655
[Waitress]  Here we are.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.241
And yours.
Enjoy.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.620
You can ask about her.
It's fine.

16:32.689 --> 16:34.068
[tense music]

16:35.931 --> 16:37.310
What does she do?

16:37.379 --> 16:39.068
Interior design.

16:39.379 --> 16:41.758
It's like hotels and
restaurants.

16:42.379 --> 16:43.586
Couple of bars.

16:44.482 --> 16:45.793
She loves it.

16:45.862 --> 16:48.137
She's very good,
she's pretty sought after.

16:48.206 --> 16:50.862
Well, that explains why
your house is so beautiful.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.931
[Jack scoffs]

16:53.172 --> 16:54.241
No kids?

16:55.068 --> 16:57.068
No, no. No kids.

16:57.379 --> 16:59.137
[gentle music]

17:00.724 --> 17:03.655
Okay. There was a bit of a
problem there.

17:04.137 --> 17:07.655
And IVF didn't, wasn't working,
so...

17:10.206 --> 17:11.586
She can't.

17:11.793 --> 17:13.517
- Oh, she can't.
- No.

17:15.689 --> 17:17.551
I'm sorry.
Is this too much?

17:17.965 --> 17:19.103
No, no, no, no. Of course not.

17:19.344 --> 17:24.275
I just, I don't really wanna
bombard you with all of this
stuff.

17:25.379 --> 17:28.000
It's not your problem,
it's, my marriage is...

17:30.620 --> 17:34.310
We've been together a really
long time and we've been
through a lot.

17:35.827 --> 17:37.275
And I wanted to make her happy.

17:37.344 --> 17:39.758
I tried to make her happy,
but...

17:40.655 --> 17:44.517
life doesn't always work
out that way, you know?

17:45.862 --> 17:50.172
You can't force someone to be
happy if fundamentally
they're...

17:51.206 --> 17:52.758
[Jack sighs]

17:54.034 --> 17:57.310
It's okay for you to
want to be happy, Jack.

17:58.482 --> 18:00.620
[traffic whooshing]

18:02.724 --> 18:05.758
Jen's agreed to a trial
separation.

18:08.103 --> 18:11.137
It's nothing big now,
it's just separate rooms.

18:11.310 --> 18:16.724
So we can think about
what we actually want.

18:17.586 --> 18:19.689
[gentle music]

18:24.689 --> 18:26.724
[Tasha]  And you can see other
people?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
If that's what I want.

18:33.310 --> 18:36.000
Is it something you might want?

18:37.379 --> 18:39.172
[gentle music]

18:43.586 --> 18:45.103
Is it something you want?

18:47.965 --> 18:50.482
[Jack and Tasha panting]

19:02.724 --> 19:07.724
[Jack and Tasha panting]

19:12.137 --> 19:13.931
[Tasha]  That was three months
ago.

19:16.379 --> 19:18.034
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

19:21.241 --> 19:22.965
And you did the test yesterday?

19:23.586 --> 19:25.620
It estimates about seven weeks.

19:25.724 --> 19:27.034
I did the entire pack.

19:27.137 --> 19:28.827
Well, that's two months ago.

19:29.965 --> 19:32.482
So when we...

19:32.689 --> 19:34.827
- You and him...
- It's not yours, Sam.

19:36.896 --> 19:38.965
- Please don't do this right
now. - Okay.

19:41.620 --> 19:43.448
So what are you gonna do about
it?

19:43.827 --> 19:44.931
[Tasha scoffs]

19:45.034 --> 19:47.068
I'm pregnant
with a married man's child.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.206
What do you think I'm gonna do?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.482
[gentle music]

19:51.551 --> 19:53.137
- Have you told him yet?

19:54.965 --> 19:56.172
[Tasha sighs]

19:56.517 --> 19:58.068
[Jack]  Are you certain?

19:58.965 --> 20:01.586
Yes, but it's fine.

20:01.655 --> 20:03.206
I've already called a clinic.

20:05.724 --> 20:07.551
Obviously I'm getting rid of
it.

20:07.758 --> 20:09.517
Tasha, come here, come here.

20:09.965 --> 20:11.379
Okay. Talk to me properly.

20:12.620 --> 20:13.965
Really properly.

20:16.896 --> 20:18.000
It's fine.

20:19.275 --> 20:20.379
I'll be fine.

20:21.448 --> 20:23.862
- It takes less than an hour.
- Shut up now.

20:23.931 --> 20:24.896
Shut up.

20:25.068 --> 20:26.379
[gentle music]

20:26.448 --> 20:27.620
This is amazing.

20:29.172 --> 20:30.482
This is perfect.

20:31.827 --> 20:33.413
This is so amazing.

20:34.310 --> 20:35.724
It's perfect.

20:35.793 --> 20:36.586
[Jack laughs]

20:36.724 --> 20:37.793
Really?

20:38.517 --> 20:40.034
Yes, of course...

20:40.482 --> 20:42.620
[gentle music]

20:43.793 --> 20:45.793
[Jack and Tasha laughing]

20:45.965 --> 20:47.310
I mean, what the fuck?

20:49.862 --> 20:51.310
[baby crying]

20:51.793 --> 20:57.689
[priest speaking in Latin]

21:06.275 --> 21:09.379
[priest continues in Latin]

21:10.206 --> 21:14.310
[baby crying]

21:14.689 --> 21:16.931
- Amen.
- [Congregants] Amen.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.620
[priest speaking in Latin]

21:18.724 --> 21:23.000
[clapping]

21:38.379 --> 21:40.275
[baby crying]

21:40.344 --> 21:42.448
[tense music]

21:50.724 --> 21:52.413
[bright music]

21:52.517 --> 21:55.655
[people laughing and chatting]

22:05.758 --> 22:08.068
[people chatting]

22:09.758 --> 22:11.758
- Dad. Cin cin.
- Thank you.

22:12.586 --> 22:15.344
[baby crying and chatter]

22:15.413 --> 22:18.482
Oh my goodness. I think you
should take him upstairs.

22:19.241 --> 22:21.448
[baby crying]

22:22.344 --> 22:25.000
[people chattering]

22:25.517 --> 22:26.655
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

22:26.758 --> 22:28.689
- Thank you. - Oh, that one's
for me, actually.

22:28.793 --> 22:30.310
You can have mine.
There you go.

22:30.413 --> 22:31.827
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize.

22:31.896 --> 22:33.551
- Anyone else? Top ups?
- [Jen]  Oh, yes, please.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.931
Me, Jackie.

22:36.655 --> 22:37.793
Thank you.

22:38.448 --> 22:40.482
- There you go. -  Oh, I'm
drinking like a fish.

22:42.827 --> 22:43.965
Guys. Picture please.

22:44.068 --> 22:44.862
Come here.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.655
Ready?

22:46.724 --> 22:48.379
- Perfectly timed.
- Huh?

22:48.482 --> 22:49.517
Oh...

22:49.586 --> 22:51.689
h, darling. Oh, it's okay.

22:51.758 --> 22:52.931
It's me.

22:54.758 --> 22:57.344
[eerie music and distant baby
cries]

22:58.310 --> 22:59.620
Gorgeous.

22:59.724 --> 23:00.586
Gorgeous.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.275
- [Jen] Oh, let me have a look.
- I knew you'd wanna have a
look.

23:04.827 --> 23:05.655
See?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
- Oh, look at her!
- Love these, by the way.

23:08.965 --> 23:10.137
Thank you.

23:11.896 --> 23:13.413
I know. I know.

23:13.482 --> 23:14.620
[bright music]

23:15.586 --> 23:18.448
[guests chattering]

23:22.034 --> 23:25.344
Are you having an... okay time?

23:25.689 --> 23:27.413
I'm having a great time.

23:27.586 --> 23:30.241
Jen's wandering around
like she's still your wife.

23:30.344 --> 23:32.689
Hayley's been ignoring
me since I got here.

23:32.793 --> 23:34.862
Oh, and your parents
haven't even said hello yet.

23:34.965 --> 23:36.379
It's not deliberate.

23:36.689 --> 23:38.241
There are... hello.

23:38.310 --> 23:41.103
... very spooky old people
they've not seen for years.

23:41.206 --> 23:43.448
Pretty sure they all think
I'm the nanny.

23:43.655 --> 23:44.724
They don't.

23:45.551 --> 23:47.655
You know she did this
deliberately, don't you?

23:47.724 --> 23:48.827
The godparent thing.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.862
She's trying to make a point.
I'm not welcome.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.068
She is not trying to make a
point.

23:55.310 --> 23:58.551
Look, come on, you know they've
been best friends since
preschool.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.965
- So...
- Not that long then.

24:01.758 --> 24:03.448
How much of this have you had?

24:04.310 --> 24:05.482
Not enough, clearly.

24:05.724 --> 24:08.482
If you're gonna have a
domestic, do it somewhere
private, please?

24:08.551 --> 24:10.862
We're not having a domestic,
you witty old cow.

24:10.931 --> 24:12.620
[bright music]

24:13.310 --> 24:14.517
Oh, here we go.

24:16.517 --> 24:19.517
[guests chattering]

24:22.655 --> 24:23.724
He's fine.

24:24.724 --> 24:27.793
I think it's just difficult
having...

24:28.586 --> 24:29.827
You know?

24:30.793 --> 24:32.931
Having both me and Jen here.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.103
Well, it's just a party,
Natasha.

24:37.034 --> 24:38.379
Jen seems okay with things.

24:38.448 --> 24:40.793
If anything, she should
be the one with the issue.

24:40.862 --> 24:41.655
- I know.

24:42.172 --> 24:43.896
But maybe for the next
big family thing,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
it's better if only one of us
comes.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.931
It's just a little bit...

24:50.034 --> 24:51.241
Yeah.

24:52.172 --> 24:55.689
Yeah. Maybe next time it would
be better if you didn't come.

24:56.241 --> 24:58.517
[guests chattering]

24:59.344 --> 25:00.793
Oh fuck off.

25:01.655 --> 25:02.931
Classy.

25:04.862 --> 25:07.241
You know, we all know
what you did to get here.

25:08.413 --> 25:10.551
To get that ring. That house.

25:12.068 --> 25:13.896
Jack and Jen tried for years
to have kids.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.068
He couldn't.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.758
His chances were incredibly
low.

25:17.862 --> 25:21.310
And then you, conveniently,
show up pregnant.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.137
You might have got everything
you wanted,

25:26.241 --> 25:28.344
but you don't get to choose
my friends.

25:28.896 --> 25:32.034
[bright music and guests
chattering]

25:33.344 --> 25:35.206
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

25:38.034 --> 25:39.931
Okay. What happened?

25:42.448 --> 25:44.172
This needs to stop.

25:45.965 --> 25:48.034
No more Jen coming to the
house.

25:48.137 --> 25:50.413
It's weird for me and for
Emily.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.379
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:51.448 --> 25:53.379
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:53.448 --> 25:55.862
Of course. I'll speak to her in
the morning.

25:56.482 --> 25:59.275
But I'll let them have today.

26:00.068 --> 26:03.137
[bright music and guests
chattering]

26:04.241 --> 26:05.448
[Jack sighs]

26:05.551 --> 26:06.551
Should we get pissed?

26:06.620 --> 26:08.379
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

26:09.551 --> 26:11.793
[tense music]

26:15.896 --> 26:17.379
Hayley said something today.

26:17.448 --> 26:18.689
[Jack]  Oh God.

26:19.482 --> 26:22.655
Whatever it was, it was
probably just Hayley being
Hayley.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.000
You'll learn to ignore it.

26:25.068 --> 26:26.310
I do.

26:26.827 --> 26:28.655
About you and Jen.

26:28.758 --> 26:31.344
She said it was you not Jen
who had fertility problems.

26:32.172 --> 26:34.241
[tense music]

26:36.034 --> 26:39.000
You said it was Jen
when you were trying for kids.

26:42.137 --> 26:43.000
Okay.

26:43.206 --> 26:44.931
[tense music]

26:46.103 --> 26:48.586
Well, yeah, she's right.

26:50.034 --> 26:54.827
Plenty of swimmers.
Just not the best athletes.

26:56.655 --> 26:59.137
So hard, but not impossible.

27:00.206 --> 27:02.724
We could have kept going,
but she wanted to stop.

27:02.793 --> 27:04.068
So we stopped.

27:05.103 --> 27:06.965
[tense music]

27:10.034 --> 27:11.551
Why didn't you tell me?

27:12.379 --> 27:14.103
Why do you think?

27:16.413 --> 27:18.655
You're a lot younger than I am.

27:19.758 --> 27:22.793
And I'm a big, stupid bloke.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.448
I quite liked you.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.310
[Tasha laughs]

27:29.724 --> 27:31.172
I quite liked you too.

27:32.206 --> 27:33.413
Yeah, I know.

27:35.034 --> 27:37.620
[tense music]

27:48.241 --> 27:52.206

[phone buzzes]

28:16.620 --> 28:19.103
[tense music]

28:29.034 --> 28:32.206
Hey, do you know where
I can find pumpkin seeds?

28:32.379 --> 28:33.448
Yeah. Come. I show you.

28:33.551 --> 28:34.689
Thank you.

28:34.896 --> 28:36.275
Thank you.

28:36.344 --> 28:37.482
Thank you.

28:39.448 --> 28:40.482
Hey.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.068
Oh, hey.

28:46.137 --> 28:47.241
Natasha.

28:47.862 --> 28:49.103
You shop here?

28:50.137 --> 28:52.379
Yeah. It's the closest
one to the house so...

28:52.517 --> 28:54.310
-Ae you local?
- Ish.

28:55.413 --> 28:56.827
Bit of a creature of habit.

28:56.931 --> 28:58.793
It's a bit of a drive,
but I do like it here.

29:01.551 --> 29:02.551
Speaking of which,

29:02.689 --> 29:05.620
thank you very much for
driving us to the christening.

29:05.689 --> 29:07.793
Hello, beautiful.

29:08.758 --> 29:10.862
Are you helping Mummy? Yeah.

29:10.931 --> 29:12.896
Oh, those things are great,
aren't they?

29:12.965 --> 29:14.724
I've got friends that swear by
them.

29:14.965 --> 29:17.310
Who has the time to make things
fresh anymore?

29:18.000 --> 29:18.793
Oh, I think...

29:19.310 --> 29:21.137
- Oh.
- Do you still want them?

29:21.310 --> 29:22.620
Yes, I do.

29:22.724 --> 29:24.344
It's all right.
I'll watch her.

29:24.413 --> 29:26.517
Hello, darling.
Yeah.

29:26.689 --> 29:28.172
What's in my basket?

29:28.275 --> 29:29.379
Sorry.

29:30.620 --> 29:34.241
[checkouts beeping]
[customers chattering]

29:40.448 --> 29:41.379
Here.

29:41.448 --> 29:42.827
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:42.896 --> 29:43.896
- Thanks.

29:44.620 --> 29:48.689
[checkouts beeping]

[tense music]

30:06.931 --> 30:08.827
[tense music]

30:24.310 --> 30:25.724
Hey, hey!

30:25.862 --> 30:28.931
Have you seen a woman?
Brunette but older.

30:29.034 --> 30:30.827
And I left my baby with her.

30:31.275 --> 30:33.448
- You left your baby?
- No. No, she has my baby.

30:33.517 --> 30:35.344
She's taking care of my baby.
I...

30:35.551 --> 30:36.724
- Natasha.

30:37.172 --> 30:39.517
-verything okay?
- Hey. Hey.

30:39.793 --> 30:41.275
[Natasha panting]

30:41.344 --> 30:42.344
Oh gosh.

30:42.482 --> 30:44.241
I just went to get some bread
from another aisle.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.724
I didn't mean to...

30:46.586 --> 30:49.551
Okay. You know what, we'll just
call this a misunderstanding.

30:49.620 --> 30:52.827
But Jen, in future, when you
are looking after other
people's kids,

30:52.931 --> 30:54.655
you don't just play it by ear.

30:55.586 --> 30:57.827
Right, I'll certainly bear that
in mind.

31:01.344 --> 31:02.172
Hey.

31:03.206 --> 31:04.275
Hey.

31:04.689 --> 31:05.793
Oh yeah.

31:06.103 --> 31:08.413
[Jack]  What else have we got?
A frog.

31:09.448 --> 31:11.965
Daddy loves frogs. Daddy loves
frogs.

31:12.103 --> 31:13.137
Look at the time.

31:14.137 --> 31:15.793
[tense music]

31:15.862 --> 31:17.172
You keep reading.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.655
Baby.

31:20.827 --> 31:23.034
[tense music]

31:28.896 --> 31:31.517
[distant talking]

31:32.137 --> 31:34.620
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Come on, come on through.

31:34.689 --> 31:37.655
She's through here.
Tasha, you've got a visitor.

31:38.517 --> 31:39.827
Surprise!

31:42.931 --> 31:44.517
Oh my God.

31:47.379 --> 31:48.724
[Tasha laughs]

31:49.689 --> 31:51.137
- Jack, Sam. Sam, Jack.
- Yes.

31:51.206 --> 31:53.310
- Yeah. Yeah. We met at the
door. - Yeah. Good to meet you.

31:53.448 --> 31:54.413
- Jack.
- Finally.

31:54.517 --> 31:55.758
Yeah, you too.

31:55.827 --> 31:57.068
Just like sealed.

31:57.172 --> 31:58.344
And throwing krill.

31:58.413 --> 32:00.655
You that's what you...
That? Throwing krill...

32:00.758 --> 32:02.000
- That's nothing to do with me.
- Instead of having...

32:02.103 --> 32:03.551
- That's nothing to do with me.
- It's nice to meet you.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.344
Right. I'm gonna go
and grab a quick sauna

32:05.448 --> 32:07.172
- and leave you two to just
catch up. - Yeah, yeah.

32:07.275 --> 32:09.689
Listen, don't let me get in the
way. Seriously.

32:09.758 --> 32:11.172
Thank you for your hospitality.

32:11.275 --> 32:12.551
No, no, no. It's no worries.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.448
There's wine in the fridge
if you want.

32:15.310 --> 32:17.344
[tense music]

32:21.241 --> 32:22.586
Did he say say sauna?

32:22.655 --> 32:24.551
[Tasha laughs]

32:26.034 --> 32:27.724
- I wanted to surprise you.
- Oh, right.

32:27.965 --> 32:29.793
Well, I'm here now.

32:30.310 --> 32:31.689
You said you were lonely.

32:31.793 --> 32:33.551
If I'd asked you,
you would've put me off.

32:33.689 --> 32:35.206
Sam, he's not an idiot.

32:35.275 --> 32:36.724
He knows you don't like him.

32:36.827 --> 32:38.482
You didn't come to the wedding.

32:38.586 --> 32:39.862
Wait, what?

32:40.931 --> 32:42.448
He's not an idiot?

32:43.689 --> 32:45.034
Stop it.

32:45.103 --> 32:46.931
Oh, come on. He doesn't care.

32:47.482 --> 32:49.482
I'm here now.
Can't hate him that much.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.137
Yeah, but you could have
texted.

32:51.206 --> 32:53.931
It's the middle of the night.
A bloke coming to see me.

32:54.551 --> 32:56.517
Okay. It's not the middle
of the night, Mum.

32:56.586 --> 32:57.896
You need to get out more.

32:58.241 --> 33:01.413
And plus, have you seen his
face? That beard?

33:01.620 --> 33:03.620
He doesn't care about
the competition.

33:04.310 --> 33:07.862
Hey, at least your ex-husband
isn't showing up. Right?

33:08.275 --> 33:10.482
- All right. That's it.
- Too far? Was that too far?

33:10.655 --> 33:12.551
- You're out. You're out.
- Okay. I'll go.

33:12.655 --> 33:14.000
I'll go.

33:15.413 --> 33:17.172
Seriously though,
what's it like being rich?

33:18.344 --> 33:19.206
[gentle music]

33:19.310 --> 33:20.517
I'm not rich.

33:21.275 --> 33:23.241
Sure. Okay, Drake.

33:23.379 --> 33:25.310
Do you wanna show me
the rest of the house or...

33:25.620 --> 33:28.137
Where's your priceless
collection of Birkin bags?

33:28.206 --> 33:30.034
- Upstairs.
- Don't joke.

33:30.206 --> 33:32.034
- You being serious?
- Yeah. I'm dead serious.

33:32.137 --> 33:33.517
They're so expensive.

33:35.758 --> 33:37.965
Still doesn't like me, does he?

33:39.896 --> 33:41.275
Sam?

33:43.931 --> 33:45.689
[Jack laughs]

33:47.586 --> 33:49.068
At least he's honest.

33:49.965 --> 33:51.172
How'd things go with him.

33:51.275 --> 33:53.310
Are you patching things up?

33:53.758 --> 33:56.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of.

33:57.758 --> 34:01.482
You know, it's really
nice to see an old face.

34:02.034 --> 34:05.344
The NCT girls are great, but
you know, they're mum friends.

34:06.862 --> 34:08.103
And he doesn't hate you.

34:08.206 --> 34:11.724
He's just protective,
like an older brother.

34:12.448 --> 34:14.689
Or a judgmental aunt.

34:14.931 --> 34:16.689
Yeah. I see it. I see it.

34:16.827 --> 34:18.103
[tense music]

34:18.172 --> 34:20.379
Listen, I know it's not ideal,

34:20.482 --> 34:22.896
but they need me to go
to New York next week.

34:22.965 --> 34:24.758
Just Thursday to Sunday.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.862
So I was thinking I could
get you and Emily a ticket

34:27.931 --> 34:30.103
if you don't want to
stay here on your own.

34:31.172 --> 34:34.517
I mean, obviously I'll be busy
but we'll have the nights

34:34.586 --> 34:37.344
and you two can explore
the city in the day.

34:37.793 --> 34:40.034
- I don't know that it's a good
idea

34:40.137 --> 34:42.862
taking her on a long-haul
flight just yet.

34:43.620 --> 34:46.413
Because I wanna get her
into a proper routine

34:47.034 --> 34:49.172
in case we start nursery soon.

34:52.793 --> 34:55.482
Wow.
Yeah, no, you're right.

34:55.655 --> 34:57.931
Don't wanna throw her off her
sleep.

35:00.689 --> 35:02.344
Oh, you don't mind me
going though, do you?

35:02.413 --> 35:03.517
Uh-uh.

35:07.344 --> 35:10.689
Listen, I spoke to Jen
after the christening

35:11.275 --> 35:13.000
and I explained everything.

35:13.655 --> 35:15.241
And she won't be coming around
anymore.

35:15.689 --> 35:18.068
[tense music]

35:28.827 --> 35:30.965
Thanks for this, Sam.
I appreciate it.

35:31.068 --> 35:32.724
- It's all right.
- Oh.

35:34.586 --> 35:35.827
Oh. Oh.

35:36.793 --> 35:38.482
Oh, she wants her rabbit.

35:38.689 --> 35:40.413
Damn.
Rabbit is upstairs.

35:40.517 --> 35:42.172
- I will just...
- No, no, no.

35:42.241 --> 35:44.241
I'll get her. Him. Where is he?

35:44.344 --> 35:46.206
- In her room.
- In her room. Right. Cool.

35:46.275 --> 35:48.000
- Got it.
- Yeah.

35:48.586 --> 35:50.862
[tense music]

35:55.517 --> 35:58.103
[[Sam pants]

36:06.206 --> 36:07.000
Oh.

36:07.551 --> 36:09.758
[tense music]

36:21.689 --> 36:23.827
Sorry. Right under the bed.

36:23.896 --> 36:25.793
[Tasha]  Always under the bed.

36:27.206 --> 36:28.482
[keypad beeps]

36:28.586 --> 36:29.758
[baby panting]

36:29.862 --> 36:32.344
You got your rabbit now. Are
you happy?

36:34.241 --> 36:35.344
Watch this.

36:35.448 --> 36:36.482
[button beeps]

36:36.793 --> 36:38.068
[gate buzzing]

36:38.275 --> 36:39.896
Oh, mate. What are you?

36:39.965 --> 36:41.965
Some mastermind villain?

36:43.793 --> 36:45.413
Wish I had a garage.

36:46.344 --> 36:47.620
[gentle music]

36:47.793 --> 36:49.862
[Sam] What, so he goes away
a lot, yeah?

36:49.965 --> 36:51.241
Does that bother you?

36:51.551 --> 36:52.758
Yeah, obviously.

36:52.827 --> 36:54.137
I miss him.

36:56.103 --> 36:58.620
It was much worse
straight after she was born.

36:59.172 --> 37:00.310
Yeah.

37:00.413 --> 37:02.068
What does he actually do?

37:02.137 --> 37:04.517
- He's a media executive.
- No. Yeah. I know that.

37:04.586 --> 37:05.862
You told me that.

37:06.103 --> 37:07.482
What does he actually do?

37:07.724 --> 37:09.172
Ah, very funny.

37:10.206 --> 37:11.793
Not sure I was trying to be.

37:13.793 --> 37:16.000
Do you guys ever talk
about what you wanna do?

37:16.137 --> 37:18.586
You know, jobs? Applying for
things?

37:20.517 --> 37:22.379
- Not yet.
- Why?

37:23.862 --> 37:25.482
Why? Does he not know
it's important to you?

37:25.586 --> 37:28.241
No, Sam, it's not him.
It's me.

37:28.310 --> 37:29.620
I just...

37:32.517 --> 37:34.000
I don't know.

37:34.241 --> 37:36.241
I don't want to leave here just
yet.

37:36.344 --> 37:38.034
It doesn't feel right.

37:40.551 --> 37:42.310
All right. Fair enough.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.275
