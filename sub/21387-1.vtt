You know, I get why
you did what you did now.

02:10.414 --> 02:13.580
And it hurts, but...

02:15.538 --> 02:17.872
hopefully,
we can move past it.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.497
What?

02:19.497 --> 02:21.456
I said, are you
originally from here?

02:23.080 --> 02:25.580
Oh, yeah.
I grew up
in Windsor Hills,

02:25.580 --> 02:27.914
but I live
in Inglewood now.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.247
- You live near here?
- Yep, born and raised.

02:30.247 --> 02:32.914
- So, where you from?
- Honestly, it doesn't
matter what I say

02:32.914 --> 02:34.914
'cause this isn't
going anywhere.

02:34.914 --> 02:37.080
Oh, yeah?
I used to work
in Inglewood.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.747
I'm in Cerritos now.

02:38.747 --> 02:40.997
( both chuckling )

02:40.997 --> 02:43.497
High school kids?
That sounds tough.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.538
- You like working with kids?
- So, how is it working
with kids?

02:46.538 --> 02:48.580
To be honest,
fuck them!

02:48.580 --> 02:51.622
But I'm trash, too,
so... you know?

02:51.622 --> 02:53.289
So, how long have you
been on Hinge?

02:53.289 --> 02:55.538
- Mmm...
- How long you
been on Bumble?

02:55.538 --> 02:57.955
- ( sighs )
- How are you still single?

03:02.247 --> 03:04.622
I'm a liar, sweetie.
I cheat on niggas, too.

03:04.622 --> 03:07.538
I do!
Probably shouldn't trust me
or I'll hurt your feelings, boo.

03:07.538 --> 03:10.122
I don't wanna be here,
but my ex won't take me back,

03:10.122 --> 03:12.872
so my broken ass is here,
small talkin' over apps.

03:12.872 --> 03:17.080
- Put it down, girl.
- I'm so dead inside,
nigga, I cry every day.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.914
You should get the check
and here's the tip-- check--

03:19.914 --> 03:21.331
( echoes )
run away!

03:22.497 --> 03:23.872
Are you okay?

03:23.872 --> 03:26.331
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm-- I'm great.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.456

You know,

I'm exactly where

03:48.414 --> 03:49.830
Oh, that's great.

03:51.788 --> 03:53.497
So, how are things
with your family?

03:53.497 --> 03:55.331
You mentioned that
your brothers tend to be

03:55.331 --> 03:56.955
a little bit
all over the place.

03:56.955 --> 03:58.663
No, I think
we're fine.

03:58.663 --> 04:00.788
We're good.
( chuckles )

04:00.788 --> 04:05.331
We haven't talked much about
your life outside of work.

04:05.331 --> 04:08.122
Is there anything there
you'd like to discuss?

04:08.122 --> 04:09.830
No, not really.

04:14.372 --> 04:17.747
Well, whenever
you're ready to open up,
just let me know,

04:17.747 --> 04:20.663
or we could switch seats
and I could tell you
my issues.

04:20.663 --> 04:22.872
( both chuckling )

04:22.872 --> 04:24.997
Thanks, I--
I really appreciate that.

04:24.997 --> 04:28.247
She's trying to get all deep,
trying to get all
in my business.

04:28.247 --> 04:30.622
Girl, that's what
they supposed to do.

04:30.622 --> 04:33.122
I mean, we just started
working together,

04:33.122 --> 04:34.872
but I at least
like that she's black.

04:34.872 --> 04:36.830
She sounds better
than the other one.

04:36.830 --> 04:37.872
True.

04:37.872 --> 04:40.164
I definitely spent
an entire session

04:40.164 --> 04:43.663
trying to explain
what "being woke" was
to Dr. Rosenberg.

04:43.663 --> 04:45.705
And then I said "nigga"
in front of Dr. Connors

04:45.705 --> 04:47.538
and he wanted to use
the rest of the time

04:47.538 --> 04:49.663
- trying to
"unpack that."
- Mm-mm.

04:49.663 --> 04:50.955
I'm just trying to be
really open-minded

04:50.955 --> 04:52.747
and give this whole
therapy shit a shot.

04:52.747 --> 04:54.914
Well, the only way
you're gonna know is
if you stick it out.

04:54.914 --> 04:56.747
Shit,
if I had insurance,
I wouldn't--

04:56.747 --> 04:59.663
girl, grey sweatpants
eyeing you at 2:00,
7:00, 3:15.

04:59.663 --> 05:02.456
- Girl, I don't know.
He on the move! Just look!
- What? Oh, him?

05:02.456 --> 05:05.622
Okay, I see you
with the superhuman
nigga repellent.

05:05.622 --> 05:09.289
- You focused!
- I know, right?
It's been a minute.

05:09.289 --> 05:11.788
One day I looked over,
my dick meter was
all the way on E.

05:11.788 --> 05:14.080
Join the club, bitch.
Dick on E.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.914
Bank account on E.

05:15.914 --> 05:18.497
Life on E.

05:18.497 --> 05:19.705
Stop. I'm fine.

05:19.705 --> 05:21.914
Nope. Malibu, bitch.
Be honest.

05:21.914 --> 05:24.372
I am! I'm way better
than I was a couple
months ago.

05:24.372 --> 05:26.914
I'm just tired
of this dating shit, girl.

05:26.914 --> 05:28.705
It's so much
fucking work.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.372
All the messages
I gotta send.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.622
I gotta be cute and careful
and witty and charming.

05:33.622 --> 05:35.289
It's a lot.

05:35.289 --> 05:37.663
I mean, not if you
just trying to fuck.

05:37.663 --> 05:39.039
And I compare every dude
to Lawrence.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.747
Well,
that's expected.

05:40.747 --> 05:42.331
( sighs )
He probably
still hates me.

05:42.331 --> 05:44.414
- But it's fine--
- Girl, he does not hate you.

05:44.414 --> 05:46.289
I mean, he still responds
to your text messages, right?

05:46.289 --> 05:48.497
It's all bills
and apartment shit,
though.

05:48.497 --> 05:50.122
Girl, he won't even
come pick up his mail

05:50.122 --> 05:52.039
because he doesn't
wanna see me.

05:52.039 --> 05:54.747
You know what?
I just want us to be cool.

05:54.747 --> 05:55.914
I don't even
want him back.

05:55.914 --> 05:57.747
It's okay if you do.

05:57.747 --> 05:59.289
But real talk, though?

05:59.289 --> 06:00.663
Guys always
want you back

06:00.663 --> 06:03.997
when they know you're
doing good without them.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.830

- Okay.

07:07.456 --> 07:10.206
Uh, nah,
Thursday's no good,

07:10.206 --> 07:13.206
but I could do
Friday after work.

07:13.206 --> 07:14.538
Mmm.

07:14.538 --> 07:15.830
Okay.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.538

07:21.955 --> 07:23.331
You'll be here.

07:24.872 --> 07:26.039

07:26.039 --> 07:27.289

07:27.289 --> 07:29.622
Ninny, what's
the meaning of this?

07:29.622 --> 07:31.872
- A book?
- Oh, listen.

07:31.872 --> 07:34.372
I just don't know
what you mean, Ms. Massa.

07:34.372 --> 07:36.997
- Ninny, so help me...
- ( gasps )

07:36.997 --> 07:39.414
...if this is anything more
than a cookbook,

07:39.414 --> 07:41.747
there will be
consequences!

in convincing
some of your students
to stay.

10:28.705 --> 10:30.414
Do we need to tailor
our curriculum

10:30.414 --> 10:32.456
to be more
culturally specific?

10:32.456 --> 10:34.622
Culturally--
I'm an art teacher

10:34.622 --> 10:36.580
and they have me
teaching geometry.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.580
So I have to
go review chapter 6.

10:38.580 --> 10:40.080

zero students,

still only speaks Spanish.

Hi, this is Molly Carter

11:31.955 --> 11:33.538
with Merrill, Johnson
& Schwartz.

11:33.538 --> 11:34.914
Woman on phone:
Oh, hi, Molly.

11:34.914 --> 11:36.289
Diane brought you
up to speed?

11:36.289 --> 11:38.663
- She sure did.
- Great. Welcome.

11:38.663 --> 11:40.622
- We've got Eric Blackwell
and Anthony from research...
- ( mouthing words )

11:40.622 --> 11:42.788
...and conferenced Saunders
on the line.

11:42.788 --> 11:44.372
We're hoping
to keep this brief.

11:44.372 --> 11:46.080
Our main objective
on this call

11:46.080 --> 11:48.538
is to cross-reference
our strategies on Sycamore

11:48.538 --> 11:50.622
and to make sure
we're all on the same page.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.663
Sorry, I thought
you were on the phone.

11:52.663 --> 11:55.663
- The major output...
- Oh!

11:55.663 --> 11:59.914
...the split in authority
on class action waivers and
arbitration clauses.

11:59.914 --> 12:02.747
We also wanna make sure
we're effectively managing
client expectations.

12:02.747 --> 12:04.997
Um, it seems like
we already know what
our client wants.

12:04.997 --> 12:08.538
We just need to
determine what jurisdiction
this matter falls under.

12:08.538 --> 12:09.997
Agreed.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.247
But we also should
continue to explore

12:12.247 --> 12:14.663
whether or not
there's a settlement
to be reached here.

12:14.663 --> 12:17.164
It's-- it's possible that
talking to this arbitrator

12:17.164 --> 12:19.497
puts us in a weaker position
than using evidence.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.164
We have to persuade...

12:57.788 --> 12:59.206
Hi, baby.

12:59.206 --> 13:01.456
What you think
about Wayne Brady?

13:01.456 --> 13:04.164
- Uh, he's cool--
- 'Cause I don't trust him!

13:04.164 --> 13:06.538
Uh, me neither.

13:06.538 --> 13:07.830
Okay, bye.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.747
Put some lotion

13:09.747 --> 13:11.039
Okay!

13:12.580 --> 13:14.997
( phone buzzing )

13:14.997 --> 13:17.164
- Yep?
- Issa: Hey!

13:17.164 --> 13:18.955
- You good?
You busy?
- Nope.

13:18.955 --> 13:20.331
Looking at
vacation fights.

13:20.331 --> 13:22.331
Ready to get
the entire fuck
up out of here!

13:22.331 --> 13:24.247
Shit, I'll go
with you.

13:24.247 --> 13:27.247
But in the meantime,
I be feeling real good lately,
you know?

13:27.247 --> 13:30.164
And I was thinking about
doing one of those Wine Downs
like how we used to do.

13:30.164 --> 13:32.914
Back when we used
to watch "I Love New York"
and drink Moscato?

13:32.914 --> 13:33.872
Yep!

13:33.872 --> 13:36.080
But how do you feel

13:36.080 --> 13:38.497
about making it
a plus-one party?

13:38.497 --> 13:41.663
Hey, we can have
everybody roll through,
bring a single friend,

13:41.663 --> 13:44.080
and then just, boom,
unions everywhere.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.206
What you think?

13:46.289 --> 13:47.580
Whoo!

13:47.580 --> 13:50.122
You know I'm always down
for a Wine Down.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.372
And I could
use one, bad.

13:52.372 --> 13:55.372
Aw! Well, how 'bout
tomorrow night?

13:55.372 --> 13:56.580
Yep.
I'll bring a case.

13:56.580 --> 13:57.456

14:03.497 --> 14:05.247
Mm-mm.

14:05.247 --> 14:06.247
Hello?

14:07.497 --> 14:08.914
Okay.

14:18.622 --> 14:21.788
We're seeing double
the attendance this year
at Audubon Middle.

14:21.788 --> 14:24.331
Engagement
is extremely high,

14:24.331 --> 14:27.622
and we've also
been teaching them
how to write résumés.

14:27.622 --> 14:29.497
Um, I think they're
a little young for résumés.

14:29.497 --> 14:31.122
But extra credit
over here is just--

14:31.122 --> 14:32.497
Okay, this is great.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.663
Issa, where are we
with East 41st Street?

14:34.663 --> 14:38.663
Kitty's reports say
you have no interest
and no attendance?

14:38.663 --> 14:39.955
Mm, yet.

14:39.955 --> 14:42.456
But we are working on
making the faculty aware

14:42.456 --> 14:44.705
of how we can help
alleviate their struggles.

14:44.705 --> 14:48.830
Oh, they're aware;
they're just not receptive.

14:48.830 --> 14:51.247
- We just haven't
connected with them yet.
- Uh, yeah.

14:51.247 --> 14:54.747
They just have
so much going on
at East 41st Street.

14:54.747 --> 14:57.622
If only we had a Latino staff
who could connect with them.

14:57.622 --> 14:59.997
- Issa: Oh, okay, I think...
- ( whispers ) I thought
she was Mexican.

14:59.997 --> 15:02.997
- I told you. Mm-mm.
- No, I've heard her
speak Spanish, I think.

15:02.997 --> 15:04.914
...but despite
all the difficulties--

15:04.914 --> 15:06.414
I know you guys
are working hard,

15:06.414 --> 15:08.872
but I don't know
if this is gonna pan out.

15:08.872 --> 15:11.538
Issa, Frieda, let's talk
new options tomorrow.

15:11.538 --> 15:14.663
Sarah and Kitty,
I'm moving you guys
to Peary Middle.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.872
- Yes!
- Joanne: Thanks.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.914
- Where's that?
- A good place.

15:22.164 --> 15:23.872
( phone buzzes )

15:33.872 --> 15:35.414
Joanne!

15:35.414 --> 15:37.372
Joanne?

15:37.372 --> 15:40.039
I don't think
we should give up yet.

15:40.039 --> 15:41.872
I love that you wanna
try this school,

15:41.872 --> 15:43.872
but we have run
into this problem before.

15:43.872 --> 15:46.331
High schools are tough,
middle schoolers just show up.

15:46.331 --> 15:49.955
- Older kids push back.
- I get that,

15:49.955 --> 15:53.414
but isn't it our job
to make things work

15:53.414 --> 15:54.872
even when
it's difficult?

15:56.164 --> 15:57.538
All right,

15:57.538 --> 15:59.414
but if I don't start
to see some progress soon,

15:59.414 --> 16:00.456
we are moving on.

16:00.456 --> 16:02.872
Okay. No, great.
Thank you.

16:02.872 --> 16:05.080
And remember,
as someone once said,

16:05.080 --> 16:08.080

your back into it.

with the Chicago winters?

16:26.788 --> 16:28.538
Really big jackets.

16:28.538 --> 16:30.830
Plus,
I never go outside.

16:30.830 --> 16:32.331
Do you think the cold
has anything to do

16:32.331 --> 16:33.747
with how violent it is
out there?

16:35.039 --> 16:36.331
Because I get it.

16:36.331 --> 16:38.705
- Okay.
- Hey, Diane,

16:38.705 --> 16:40.622
we didn't get
our bonuses early,
did we?

16:40.622 --> 16:43.289
Oh, my God, no way.
I wish.

16:43.289 --> 16:44.872
Well, where's Travis?

16:44.872 --> 16:47.206
Mm.
I saw him at the bar.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.580
Oh, I see him.
I'll be right back.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.538
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

16:54.538 --> 16:55.914
What you drinking?

16:55.914 --> 16:57.497
Uh, everything
'cause it's free.

16:57.497 --> 16:59.580
( both chuckling )

17:00.914 --> 17:02.705
Since the partners
are drunk tonight,

17:02.705 --> 17:05.830
I'm, uh, thinking
about putting a buzz
in their ear for a raise.

17:05.830 --> 17:07.538
Oh, okay.
Right.

17:07.538 --> 17:09.705
You've been
buzzing already?

17:09.705 --> 17:11.080
About a raise?

17:11.080 --> 17:13.122
What, so they can expect
even more out of me?

17:13.122 --> 17:15.372
Fuck, no!

17:15.372 --> 17:17.372
You guys,
are my cheeks red?

17:17.372 --> 17:18.914
Are my ears red?

17:18.914 --> 17:21.331
I feel like
I'm getting too drunk
to be at work drunk.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.122
- Do I look...? No?
- You're fine.

17:23.122 --> 17:24.497
- Okay.
- Oh, here we go.

17:24.497 --> 17:26.372
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

17:26.372 --> 17:29.830
Hannah:
Thank you. I-- I really,
really appreciate this.

17:29.830 --> 17:31.164
It's-- it's really
too much!

17:31.164 --> 17:33.206
Now, everyone who has
worked with Hannah

17:33.206 --> 17:35.955
knows that she is
truly, truly a force.

17:35.955 --> 17:38.164
Am I right?
I mean, really just...

17:38.164 --> 17:40.580
( scoffs )
Yeah, a force
that they forced out.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.997
Stop it! God.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.331
Why is everybody
pretending

17:45.331 --> 17:47.289
the Chicago office
is not a step down?

17:47.289 --> 17:48.663
What are you
talking about?

17:48.663 --> 17:50.289
She couldn't handle
the pressure.

17:50.289 --> 17:51.497
The partners
could tell.

17:51.497 --> 17:53.039
Uh, I doubt that.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.289
She was always working
later than anybody.

17:55.289 --> 17:57.497
If anything, she's leaving
because she didn't feel valued.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.039
Well, then she should've
said something.

17:59.039 --> 18:01.414
- Closed mouth, no food.
- ( scoffs )

18:01.414 --> 18:04.414
Right, 'cause everyone
automatically listens
to a woman

18:04.414 --> 18:06.206

her mouth.

Why don't we open
my Napa Valley wine?

19:49.663 --> 19:53.289

just in case you didn't
have one.

19:53.289 --> 19:55.414

looking the flyest.

20:38.872 --> 20:41.830
And look at you
with your coat.

20:41.830 --> 20:44.414
And look at you
with your...

20:44.414 --> 20:46.372
Shut the fuck up!
( scoffs )

20:46.372 --> 20:48.039
- ( chuckles )
- Yeah.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.872
( doorbell rings )

20:54.872 --> 20:56.206
( exhales )

20:59.122 --> 21:00.372
You ready?

21:06.247 --> 21:08.206
Oh, so Sheila's
still talking about
her foot surgery?

21:08.206 --> 21:10.622
Still.
Just any excuse
not to stand.

21:10.622 --> 21:12.538
And she still giving out
them dollar coins.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.997
Don't nobody want
them Sacagaweas.

21:16.705 --> 21:18.538
How's the apartment
search going?

21:18.538 --> 21:21.206
My cousin got
a Westside Rentals
password if you want that.

21:21.206 --> 21:22.872
No, that's all right.

21:22.872 --> 21:24.247
Chad's helping me look.

21:24.247 --> 21:26.538
Sound like
he pressing you
to get out.

21:26.538 --> 21:29.039
- Nah, it's
his fiancé, though.
- ( chuckles )

21:32.914 --> 21:34.622
What's wrong?

21:36.497 --> 21:37.788
I just hate moving.

21:37.788 --> 21:39.372
You know,
it's stressful

21:39.372 --> 21:41.538
and I still got
a bunch of stuff

21:41.538 --> 21:44.247
to take care of
at my old spot.

21:44.247 --> 21:46.705
For real?
Like what?

21:46.705 --> 21:49.538
You know,
just odds and ends.

21:49.538 --> 21:52.039
What's stopping you?

21:53.580 --> 21:56.414
Time. You know,
just finding the time.

21:58.456 --> 22:01.164
Girl, you wanna
go in on some of those
popcorn shrimp rolls, though?

22:01.164 --> 22:02.997
Oh, thank you!

22:02.997 --> 22:04.538
I was only here
trying to be cute,

22:04.538 --> 22:06.914
but I am still
hungry as hell.

22:06.914 --> 22:09.872
♪ Lookin' like
I caught a lick ♪

22:09.872 --> 22:12.788
♪ Caught a lick, run up on me,
you get hit... ♪

22:12.788 --> 22:14.830
And then I saw
this white nigga's
paycheck.

22:14.830 --> 22:17.914
- Fuck, no!
- Y'all been there
the same amount of time?

22:17.914 --> 22:19.705
Yup. But, I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

22:19.705 --> 22:21.747
I can't just roll up
to the partners and be like,

22:21.747 --> 22:24.039
"Hey, guys,
so I accidentally noticed

22:24.039 --> 22:25.955
that you're paying
this white man more than me."

22:25.955 --> 22:28.497
- Wait, what?
What happened?
- This is so typical.

22:28.497 --> 22:31.663
My aunt found out
she made less than
some of her white employees.

22:31.663 --> 22:33.497
- Molly: Stop.
- Spoke up about it.

22:33.497 --> 22:36.663
Nothing happened.
She still has to work there.

22:36.663 --> 22:38.788
Man, fuck that.
I'm one of the best
lawyers they have.

22:38.788 --> 22:40.414
I'm not one of these
work-twice-as-hard,

22:40.414 --> 22:42.497
pay-me-half-as-much
type of bitches...

22:42.497 --> 22:44.705
- Nah!
- Kelli: Mm-mm, that's why
I make sure my white clients

22:44.705 --> 22:47.039
get less
on their tax returns.

22:47.039 --> 22:48.788
It's reparations.
That's what that is.

22:48.788 --> 22:50.830
I feel like Robin Hood.
You know what I mean?

22:50.830 --> 22:52.206
- It's the facts.
- It's just facts!

22:52.206 --> 22:53.955
I don't care
if I get in trouble.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.872
I'm doing it and that's
what I marched for.

22:55.872 --> 22:58.164
I took off work so I could
walk down the street,

22:58.164 --> 23:00.538
and do shit
to white people finally.

23:00.538 --> 23:02.331
Real talk,
don't tell nobody

23:02.331 --> 23:04.080
'cause I'm gonna go
to full jail.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.580
- I'm not surprised.
- Like, full ja--

23:05.580 --> 23:07.872
- like, you ever see
"Lock Up Abroad?"
- Mm.

23:07.872 --> 23:09.538
They gonna
lock a broad up.

23:11.580 --> 23:12.705
What's going on?

23:15.414 --> 23:17.747
Lawrence isn't coming.

23:17.747 --> 23:20.538
Why would he have
been coming?

23:20.538 --> 23:25.372
Because I may have told him
to come get his mail.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.705
At this exact time.

23:28.705 --> 23:30.663
( scoffs )

23:30.663 --> 23:32.331
Wow. Okay.

23:32.331 --> 23:33.830
So you threw a party,

23:33.830 --> 23:36.164
Lawrence was supposed
to come over to said party,

23:36.164 --> 23:38.164
and if he would've showed up,
what was your plan?

23:38.164 --> 23:40.247
You said that a nigga
always comes back

23:40.247 --> 23:43.122
when he thinks
that you're good,
and look, I'm good.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.705
But that's in Malibu.
And I thought you said
you didn't want him back.

23:45.705 --> 23:47.414
Bitch, of course
I want my man back.

23:47.414 --> 23:49.039
What the fuck?
I was lying.

23:49.039 --> 23:50.747
The whole point
of saying Malibu
is to not lie.

23:50.747 --> 23:52.914
Well, at the time,
I thought I was not lying.

23:52.914 --> 23:56.247
- Malibu. You stupid.
- Malibu. Shut the fuck up.

23:56.247 --> 23:57.705
( door opens )

23:57.705 --> 24:01.080
Whoo!
Bad news, ladies.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.372
I drank all the Rossi.

24:03.372 --> 24:05.080
( laughing )

24:05.080 --> 24:06.538
Oh!

24:07.747 --> 24:10.747
Can they come
party with us?

24:10.747 --> 24:12.206
Man:
Y'all having a party?

24:13.914 --> 24:15.372
Sure, why not?

24:15.372 --> 24:18.122
Oh, I'm gonna
put you to bed.

24:18.122 --> 24:20.705
You ever been burped?

24:20.705 --> 24:21.914
- Burped?
- ( Kelli laughing )

24:23.414 --> 24:25.955
( music playing )

24:25.955 --> 24:27.247
( chatter )

24:27.247 --> 24:28.747
You live here, right?

24:28.747 --> 24:29.705
Yeah.

24:30.914 --> 24:32.289
Do you have any herb?

24:32.289 --> 24:33.705
Yeah, I've got
a prescription.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.080
( gasps )

24:35.080 --> 24:36.247
Looks like
we got "bompany."

24:36.247 --> 24:37.788
What up, y'all?
This a party?

24:37.788 --> 24:39.747
Oh, hey, Thug--
uh, Miles.

24:39.747 --> 24:41.331
No, we're just
keeping it low-key.

24:41.331 --> 24:43.039
Yeah, for sure.
What's up with your friend?

24:44.538 --> 24:47.080
- Is that you?
- No, you know I'm not gay.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.830
Hey. Hey, you "bute"
and you thick.

24:49.830 --> 24:52.497
- What's your name?
- Kelli, but I don't
talk to grown men

24:52.497 --> 24:54.039
who wear limited colors
and bang.

24:54.039 --> 24:55.914
I don't bang,
sweetheart.

24:55.914 --> 24:58.206
I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.497
Well, what if
I like both?

25:00.497 --> 25:01.622
Mmm.

25:01.622 --> 25:03.997
( both mouthing )

25:03.997 --> 25:05.414
Hey, whose speaker
is this?

25:05.414 --> 25:07.080
I'm about to "bonnect" it.
I got a playlist.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.705
Yeah, yeah,
that's mine.

25:08.705 --> 25:10.747
My phone's
already connected, so...

25:10.747 --> 25:13.622
- ( music playing )
- What the fuck?

25:13.622 --> 25:15.122
Oh, shit!

25:15.122 --> 25:16.747
Thug Yoda:
Hey! Okay.

25:16.747 --> 25:17.955
Yeah!

25:17.955 --> 25:19.414
Hey. Yeah.

25:19.414 --> 25:20.872
Hey, look at
my nigga footwork.

25:20.872 --> 25:23.497
- Kelli: Oh, my God!
- Thug Yoda: Fuck that!

25:23.497 --> 25:25.872
Did he choreograph that?
Is this choreography?

25:25.872 --> 25:27.580
Thug Yoda:
Hey, hey!

25:27.580 --> 25:28.955
Yeah, nigga!

25:28.955 --> 25:30.788
- Oh, my God.
- Turn the music off.

25:32.497 --> 25:35.914
Yo, Issa, this shit
is getting kind of
out of hand.

25:35.914 --> 25:38.289
( knocks )
Hey!

25:38.289 --> 25:39.747
Can y'all
turn this down?

25:39.747 --> 25:41.289
Some of us got kids.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.538
Bitch, I got kids, too!
Turn up!

25:44.997 --> 25:47.622
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit! Fire!
Fire, fire!

25:47.622 --> 25:50.372
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

25:50.372 --> 25:52.164
Women and children!
Women and children!

25:52.164 --> 25:53.955
- Let me get your number.
- Nigga, no!

25:53.955 --> 25:55.830
- Shit!
- Jesus!

25:55.830 --> 25:57.497
( people screaming )

26:04.663 --> 26:06.663
Molly:
Oh, my God.

26:06.663 --> 26:10.497
- ( panting ) Oh, my God.
- Tiffany: Don't touch
my braid!

26:10.497 --> 26:11.705
Jesus Christ.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.872
( sighs, mouths word )

26:14.872 --> 26:17.331
( chatter )

26:25.788 --> 26:27.122
You know what?

26:27.122 --> 26:29.164
If I weren't already here,
I would come here.

26:31.830 --> 26:33.080
Do they know
we're in this room?

26:33.080 --> 26:34.247
Yep.
Now we just wait.

26:36.080 --> 26:36.997
Okay.

26:47.872 --> 26:49.788
- Um, hey.
- Hi.

26:49.788 --> 26:51.247
What do you guys do?

26:51.247 --> 26:53.497
We give you all the tools
you need to succeed.

26:53.497 --> 26:54.705
Where are you
having trouble?

26:54.705 --> 26:56.538
Uh, do you guys
tutor geometry?

26:56.538 --> 26:58.663
- Our teachers
don't know it.
- Oh, absolutely!

26:58.663 --> 27:01.872
We have great tutors.
I, myself, am an expert
in English and Latin.

27:01.872 --> 27:04.206
- Not that you need it.
- I see, I see.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.747
Well, I think
I have one of those
learning disabilities, so--

27:06.747 --> 27:09.622
Oh, that's great.
Oh, I mean, not great,
but great because we have--

27:09.622 --> 27:11.206
Both:
Do you guys
have pamphlets?

27:11.206 --> 27:13.080
Oh, yes,
we have a bunch!

27:13.080 --> 27:14.997
Here,
tell all your friends.

27:14.997 --> 27:17.039
And in the meantime,
we can just sit here and--

27:17.039 --> 27:19.872
- Thank you!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- I'll get the Oreos.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.164
Hold on. Seri--
come on, y'all! Really?

27:22.164 --> 27:24.914
- Are y'all serious?
- ( speaking Spanish )

27:24.914 --> 27:26.914
( kids cheering )

27:28.080 --> 27:29.705
Did that really
just happen?

27:29.705 --> 27:31.206
Yep.

27:31.206 --> 27:33.247
But, hey,
at least they came.

27:33.247 --> 27:34.705
Now we just need
to get them to stay.

27:34.705 --> 27:37.247
The food was supposed
to make them stay.

27:37.247 --> 27:39.788
True.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.331
We just have to try
a different approach.

27:41.331 --> 27:42.788
Next time,
I will stand by the food

27:42.788 --> 27:44.206
and you can
lock the door,

27:44.206 --> 27:45.747
- and then--
- Frieda.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.914
Sometimes you just
have to know when
to give up.
