come to the police station
all by herself.

44:12.258 --> 44:14.173
That's why you
did it, isn't it?

44:16.349 --> 44:18.525
Plain old guilt.

44:19.526 --> 44:21.876
Isn't that
just like a woman?

44:25.793 --> 44:27.142
Where's the Sheriff?

44:27.273 --> 44:28.448
He's transferring
Shannon Moore

44:28.578 --> 44:29.884
to the state
penitentiary.

44:30.015 --> 44:32.278
Alone?Yeah.

44:32.408 --> 44:34.410
But that's not protocol.
How can he do that?

44:34.541 --> 44:36.369
I guess there were
death threats.

44:40.112 --> 44:41.417
Hey, it's happening
right now.

44:41.548 --> 44:43.898
Barnum's taking
Shannon to Rawlins.

44:44.029 --> 44:45.683
She's never gonna
get there.

44:45.813 --> 44:47.336
Joe, what are
we gonna do?

44:47.467 --> 44:48.903
Stick to the plan.
Go to DCI.

44:49.774 --> 44:51.123
Tell them it's urgent.

44:52.602 --> 44:53.995
But what if you don't
catch up to Barnum?

44:54.126 --> 44:56.389
What if he kills her?

44:56.519 --> 44:58.696
Joe, everyone else has
abandoned these women.

44:59.566 --> 45:01.481
Well, then,
wish me luck.

45:02.351 --> 45:03.526
I love you.

45:04.353 --> 45:05.354
I love you, too.

45:12.492 --> 45:14.450
[SIREN BLARING]

45:19.281 --> 45:21.240
So, when are you
gonna pull over
and let me escape?

45:23.372 --> 45:24.809
That was the plan,
wasn't it?

45:46.656 --> 45:48.049
[GASPS][TIRES SCREECHING]

45:53.011 --> 45:55.013
Where are we going?

45:55.143 --> 45:57.842
Frank Urman
was my best friend
in the world.

45:57.972 --> 45:59.887
He was worth
ten of you.

46:01.149 --> 46:02.542
If there wasn't
such a mess,

46:02.672 --> 46:05.675
I'd cut you open,
hang you up
by your goddamn guts

46:05.806 --> 46:08.026
and leave your eyes
for the crows to peck out.

46:08.156 --> 46:09.984
Just like I did
Marissa.

46:10.115 --> 46:11.725
Oh, but don't worry.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.509
I'll still
make it bad
for you.

46:15.816 --> 46:17.383
This is Sheriff Barnum.

46:17.513 --> 46:19.559
Suspect has escaped.
Send reinforcements.

46:19.689 --> 46:20.778
She may be armed
and...

46:24.956 --> 46:25.870
What the hell?

46:36.576 --> 46:37.490
[OVER SPEAKER]
Clear the road.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.407
You're obstructing
police business.

46:41.537 --> 46:43.626
Clear the road
or you will be placed
under arrest.

46:45.454 --> 46:46.586
Clear the road!

46:47.674 --> 46:49.284
Goddamn it!

47:02.167 --> 47:04.647
Marybeth,
what the hell
are you doing?

47:06.084 --> 47:07.520
Taking custody
of your prisoner.
