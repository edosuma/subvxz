06:26.761 --> 06:28.729

06:28.889 --> 06:30.983

07:01.713 --> 07:05.308

07:33.870 --> 07:34.962
Oh, look at that!

07:36.498 --> 07:38.296
I haven't told them
how old you are.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.176
Best not.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.303
But it is 20 years
since you joined Selfridges.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.259
And I hope to be here
for many years more.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.301
Thank you.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.344

07:53.056 --> 07:53.932

07:58.561 --> 08:00.359
(laughing)

08:00.522 --> 08:02.240
You and Frank
all settled in?

08:02.399 --> 08:03.946
So much to do.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.577
So many rooms!

08:05.735 --> 08:08.204
And the furniture from the old
flat looks tiny in there.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.788

to see it, then?

08:12.951 --> 08:14.999

08:15.161 --> 08:16.583
Everything's topsy-turvy,

08:16.746 --> 08:18.544
but if it's just you two,
it won't matter.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.583
Uh!

08:19.749 --> 08:21.217
You're family.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.923

08:23.086 --> 08:29.014
Good, well, it'll be nice

08:29.175 --> 08:30.518
Saturday.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.974
Can't wait.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.018

08:38.183 --> 08:39.400
Mrs. Crabb will be
very disappointed

08:39.561 --> 08:41.688
if I don't bring home
a trout or two.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.755
She's a talented woman.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.965
Made a new life for herself.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.256
She's sorely missed.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.890

09:30.028 --> 09:31.996
Mr. Gordon,
how lovely to see you.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.281
Mrs. Edwards.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.371
How are
the provincial stores?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.035
Ticking over.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.580
The Chief's lucky you keep
such a close eye on them.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.838
That's the job he gave me.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.715

10:03.353 --> 10:04.855
FRANK:

10:05.021 --> 10:06.523

about the black boxer.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.941
The American champion.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.360
Wanted to fight
the British champ,

10:09.526 --> 10:11.494
can't because
of the color bar.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.907
It seems Victor's doing it
as an exhibition match.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.620
I hope we get
an invite.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.636
Mr. Selfridge,
you have a visitor.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.670
Yes?

10:39.931 --> 10:40.807
Hello, Harry.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.478

10:50.859 --> 10:52.577

10:52.735 --> 10:55.739
What are you doing
back in London'?

10:55.905 --> 10:59.284
MAE: Well, one of my ventures
hasn't gone so well.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.250
So I need to sell my shares
in Selfridges.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.790
Oh, Mae...

11:04.956 --> 11:07.425
It was such a pleasure
buying them from Loxley.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.053
I really don't want
to let them go,

11:10.211 --> 11:11.428
but the truth is...

11:11.588 --> 11:13.386
Well, I need the money.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.680
See, according to my husband,
I'm getting a divorce.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.767
I'm so sorry.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.651
I had no idea.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.312
WOMAN: How dare you
speak to me like that!

11:27.478 --> 11:29.572
Who do you think you are?

11:29.731 --> 11:30.948
I'm sorry, Mr. Grove,

11:31.107 --> 11:32.359
but I can't work in this house
a minute longer!

11:33.610 --> 11:34.953
Well...

11:35.111 --> 11:36.363
She told me
she was in charge!

11:36.529 --> 11:37.746
Meryl called her
an interfering old bat.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.032
MERYL: She told me I
should watch what I say!

11:39.199 --> 11:40.075
Be quiet.

11:41.910 --> 11:42.706
Ernest.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.130
Meryl.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.514
MERYL: She treated
me like a child.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.094
GROVE: Because you
behave like one.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.600
You have been a thorn
in the side

11:57.759 --> 11:59.261
of every nanny,

11:59.427 --> 12:01.145
mother's help,
and universal aunt

12:01.304 --> 12:03.398
that has ever had
the misfortune to work here.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.979
Now that you've finished school,
you have even more time

12:06.142 --> 12:08.565
to devote
to your histrionics.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.980
It can't go on.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.944
Are you going to be
in a bad mood all evening?

12:12.106 --> 12:13.733
It's your birthday.

12:13.900 --> 12:14.822
We've made cake.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.452
Don't spoil things.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.417
Oh no, I knew he was
having an affair.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.796
I didn't mind.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.378
We're both adults.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.963
He's French.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.594
And she wasn't the first.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.347
But this one is not content
to play the mistress, oh, no.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.723
I'm sorry.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.225
He knows
I can't go to court.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.139
That would mean every sordid
detail dragged up in public.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.399
So I have to go quietly.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.525
And I won't get a penny
from him.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.149
I earn pin money
from my fashion house in Paris.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.693
It's just a rich
woman's hobby.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.452
But I have my shares,

12:58.611 --> 13:00.534
and if I sell them,
then I can afford to live.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.998
I'm sorry, Harry.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.874
Do you remember
when I first came to London?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.509
You opened doors for me

13:13.668 --> 13:16.171
when everyone was
slamming them shut.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.839
So it's my turn now, Mae.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.517
Let me help you.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.935
You know you can
count on me.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.733
Good afternoon, sir.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.767
Afternoon.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.692
Oh, I'm afraid Mr. Gordon
has already left.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.823
Oh, I forgot.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.656
And there's a Mr. Keen
to see you.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.571
From the London Civic
Building Society.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.536
Mr. Selfridge.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.042
As the London Civic is
Selfridges' major shareholder,

13:46.200 --> 13:47.747
I felt I should
introduce myself.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.378
And may I say
how delighted I am

13:49.537 --> 13:50.288
to meet you.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.172
You're replacing

13:51.331 --> 13:53.174
Mr. Eavis.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.961
One of our original
board members.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.970
I was wondering if you might
find time for a meeting?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.595
Oh, I'm a little busy.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.260
I'm sure Mr. Crabb can help.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.180
Shall we?

14:21.611 --> 14:23.033
Daddy!

14:23.196 --> 14:24.448
Hello, boys.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.706
Come here.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.208
Oh my goodness,
you're getting big.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.085
Have they been good boys?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.119
Yes!

14:30.286 --> 14:31.412
Sort of.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.712
Well, seeing as Mommy
seems to believe

14:35.875 --> 14:36.876
you've been
very well behaved,

14:37.043 --> 14:39.341
guess what I've got for you?

14:39.504 --> 14:40.380
What do you say?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.422
Thank you!

14:42.799 --> 14:45.268
How was your father?

14:45.426 --> 14:46.894
Well, he missed the meeting.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.726
I waited for two hours.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.765
It must have been
something important.

14:50.932 --> 14:55.859
Every so often, he likes
to remind me who's in charge.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.899
Promise me you won't fall out
with our boys.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.862
Come on.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.201
Family means
everything to me.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.832
HARRY:
<i>It's Violette's flat.</i>

15:07.990 --> 15:09.458
She's in Paris.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.415
I know it's not
what you're used to.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.799
No, it's a roof
over my head.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.335
Thank you.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.849
She's 18 years old.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.058
The new Madame Rennard.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.650
She has big blue eyes
and cherry lips.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.270
She sounds awful.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.313
(laughs)

15:42.233 --> 15:46.033
She's playing him like a violin,
and I should know.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.074
Turns out the older you get,
the harder it is to play.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.584
You're not old.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.665
Well, you're at the top
of your game, Harry,

15:53.828 --> 15:55.546
so you probably don't feel it,

15:55.705 --> 15:57.799
but I did not expect to be
starting all over again.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.379
Not at my age.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.759
You're not starting
over again.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.386
Tomorrow, I want you
to come into the store,

16:02.545 --> 16:04.388
look around Fashion
with Mrs. Towler,

16:04.547 --> 16:06.470
and pick out
whatever you like.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.054
Oh, Harry, I won't...

16:08.217 --> 16:09.264
Something beautiful.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.519
Then you and I will go out.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.850
Like we used to.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.016
Get your mind off things.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.277
And perhaps I can
persuade you to stay.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.861
(muffled):
Where is everyone?

16:23.024 --> 16:23.900
Come on!

16:24.066 --> 16:25.488
We're late enough <i>as</i> it is!

16:28.112 --> 16:28.829
Bag?

16:28.988 --> 16:29.659
Alice, you have my hat.

16:29.822 --> 16:30.539
Why would I have your hat?

16:30.698 --> 16:31.244
Bag.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.626
Plimsolls.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.795
Well?

16:39.957 --> 16:41.004
"The Millingford Girls School

16:41.167 --> 16:42.339
are happy to offer you
a teaching position."

16:42.502 --> 16:43.879
Well done, Meryl!

16:44.045 --> 16:45.262
Well done, Meryl.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.847
Well, come on, you lot,
off you go.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.556
Can't be late
for registration.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.097
Finish that toast
before you get there.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.230
Have a good day!

16:55.389 --> 16:56.106
Bye, Father.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.865
They want me to start
in September.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.535
I might have found
something else by then.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.867
Teaching is a responsible,
respectable job.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.589
You might find it more
rewarding than you think.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.339
How would you know?

17:23.166 --> 17:24.089
Meryl...

17:25.836 --> 17:27.930
Have a good day.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.387
And please clean up
from breakfast.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.184
Our haute couture range
is extensive.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.691
We have Vionnet
and Patou here,

17:38.849 --> 17:40.897
all the latest fashion
from Paris.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.361
What's this?

17:45.523 --> 17:47.491
This is ready-to-wear.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.243
We make them in store.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.872
Inexpensive materials
in three sizes.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.250
For secretaries
and usherettes...

17:56.409 --> 17:59.208
Rather them than me.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.340
Well, it's a step up
from making your own.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.502
I'm used to Paris.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.888
French women have style
in their bones.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.468
Oh.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.725
Don't they have
ready-to-wear?

18:14.969 --> 18:17.848
No, they have something
much better.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.766
MAE:
<i>It's luxury ready-to-wear.</i>

18:19.932 --> 18:22.230
Designed with taste
and flair.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.020
They cut them
in the machine room,

18:24.186 --> 18:25.529
but then they
hand-finish them.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.156
They're beautiful.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.943
Something you'd be proud to have
on your fashion floor.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.032
But who would buy them?

18:32.194 --> 18:34.196
Well, women who can't
afford couture,

18:34.363 --> 18:36.365
but they don't have to buy
ready-to-wear.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.909
I really think
you need something

18:38.075 --> 18:39.247
in the middle here, Harry.

18:39.410 --> 18:42.459
We'd be the first store
in London to offer it.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.795
Yes.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.004
Why don't you help me?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.043
What?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.802
You have a fashion house.

18:48.961 --> 18:49.962
You know what women want.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.130
You've just told me.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.049
Goodness.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.434
Oh, Harry, my life's in pieces.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.970
I don't even know
what I'm doing next.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.729
I don't even know
if I'll stay in London.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.982
Please.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.858
Would you think about it?

19:03.017 --> 19:04.018
All right.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.482
In the meantime,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.318
I want you
to see something.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.361
The Queen of Time.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.200
She's getting a grand unveiling
right here at the store.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.910
Oh, lucky her.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.495
Will you stay for that,
at least?

19:19.950 --> 19:21.668
All right!

19:21.827 --> 19:22.919
All right.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.502
So are your newspapers ready
for the Reform Act,

19:25.665 --> 19:27.087
Lord Wynnstay?

19:27.249 --> 19:29.001
"Women's rights."

19:29.168 --> 19:30.841
Some of your readers are women.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.630
And they don't give two hoots
for politics.

19:32.797 --> 19:37.348
They like knitting, recipes,
babies, and gossip.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.558
So you'll be ignoring
their emancipation?

19:39.720 --> 19:41.563
Not quite.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.771
One good thing:
girls are easily led.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.438
If they get the vote at 21--
and I hope they don't--

19:48.604 --> 19:51.153
they'll vote the way
my papers tell them.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.737
Now, what have you got
for me?

19:54.777 --> 19:56.871
The Queen of Time.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.407
Agrand new monument
for Oxford Street.

19:59.573 --> 20:03.077
Harry Selfridge wants
free advertising.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.871
In return for VIP <i>press</i> access.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.414
He can always go somewhere else.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.456
Really?

20:07.623 --> 20:11.218
He's got a colorful
family, Harry.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.096
That Russian son-in-law.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.132
He's one for the ladies.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.560
You've got a story?

20:19.719 --> 20:21.016
Mmm.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.728
Some dirty linen Harry
wouldn't want aired in public.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.943
Just let him know.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.412
Here we go.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.119
Ah, nicely done.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.955
It's rather beautiful.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.119
Lovely.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.005
Have you found
a new nanny yet?

20:48.164 --> 20:49.882
Yes.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.667
Let's hope she lasts longer
than the previous one.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.754
You do a terrific job, Roger.

20:54.920 --> 21:00.268
I just worry they suffer
without a maternal influence.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.061
You and Josie
never regretted parting?

21:12.938 --> 21:18.115
Stepmother to five children,
that's a huge undertaking.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.702
Even had Meryl been
a more tractable child.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.332
We agreed.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.122
Clean break, the only way.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.221
(laughing)

21:42.384 --> 21:44.102
REPORTER:
It's the Dolly sisters!

21:44.261 --> 21:45.888
Jenny, Rosie!

21:46.055 --> 21:48.558
It's good to have you back
in London.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.442
Mr. Dillon!

22:06.075 --> 22:06.951
Oh!

22:07.117 --> 22:07.993
Mae.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.665
I heard you were back
in London.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.459
REPORTER:
Jenny, Rosie, over here!

22:17.753 --> 22:19.255
Oh, here comes trouble--
the Dolly sisters.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.923
Who are they with?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.182
VICTOR:
Jimmy Dillon.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.093
This was all his idea.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.261
HARRY:
Who is he?

22:25.427 --> 22:29.307
VICTOR:
Promoter, investor, fixer.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.608
He did a few deals in theatre,
then went into clubs.

22:35.813 --> 22:36.939
And boxing.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.655
I get the door receipts,
Jimmy's running the bank.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.364
Some deep pockets
here tonight.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.403
My, oh my,

22:42.570 --> 22:44.038
Harry Selfridge!

22:44.196 --> 22:45.869
Harry?

22:46.031 --> 22:49.160
Ah, Jenny, Rosie!

22:49.326 --> 22:51.203
Haven't seen you in years,
where have you been?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.872
We've been in America.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.255
Touring forever.

22:54.415 --> 22:55.667
We keep saying we'll stop.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.301
Singing and dancing's
all we can do.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.336
Oh, that's not
quite true.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.757
Showgirls always know how
to have a good time, right?

23:02.923 --> 23:04.345
We've heard all about

23:04.508 --> 23:05.725
your French adventures!

23:07.887 --> 23:09.230
You haven't changed a bit.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.514
Neither have you.

23:10.681 --> 23:11.807
Oh, we have.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.726
Yes, we're frightfully,
delightfully, rich!

23:13.893 --> 23:15.941
Rich.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.195
Jimmy Dillon.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.776
Harry Selfridge.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.111
The Earl of Oxford Street.

23:20.274 --> 23:21.651
And Madame Rennard.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.989
So, Victor tells me
this is all because of you.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.533
I'm just giving people
what they want.

23:28.699 --> 23:29.575
Excuse me.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.333
GROVE (reading) "Washerwoman,
indeed!", he shouted recklessly.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.500
"Ho, ho!

23:38.667 --> 23:41.921
"I am the Toad,
the motor-car snatcher,

23:42.087 --> 23:45.887
"the prison-breaker,
the Toad who always escapes!

23:46.050 --> 23:48.678
"Sit still, and you shall know
what driving really is,

23:48.844 --> 23:51.563
"for you are in the hands
of the famous, the skillful,

23:51.722 --> 23:54.316
the entirely fearless Toad!"

23:54.475 --> 23:56.978
(laughing)

23:57.144 --> 23:58.020
There we are.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.905
Can we get a car?

24:00.064 --> 24:01.532
Certainly not,
they're very expensive.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.445
Night, night.

24:06.612 --> 24:07.488
Night.

24:15.120 --> 24:15.996
Vroom!

24:18.540 --> 24:20.167
Boop boop!

24:26.090 --> 24:29.014
Now, ladies and gentlemen, for
the highlight of the evening!

24:29.176 --> 24:32.521
First up, fighting from
the United States of America,

24:32.680 --> 24:33.522
Joe Langford!

24:33.681 --> 24:35.649
HARRY:
Let's go, Joe!

24:35.808 --> 24:38.436
(mixed cheering and jeering)

24:38.602 --> 24:40.149
All right, Joe.

24:41.397 --> 24:44.150
Attaboy, Joe,
give him hell.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.320
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

24:47.486 --> 24:50.581
would you please put your hands
together and make some noise

24:50.739 --> 24:54.664
for our very own British
champion, Tommy Butler!

24:54.827 --> 24:58.627
(cheering)

24:58.789 --> 24:59.836
(whistling)

24:59.999 --> 25:00.875
Boo!

25:05.504 --> 25:06.847
Best of luck, chaps!

25:07.006 --> 25:08.132
Have a good fight,
have a good fight.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.392
Get him down, Joe,
come on, you got this.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.520
Who's your money on?

25:15.139 --> 25:16.686
Britain or America?

25:16.849 --> 25:17.600
MAN:
14 pounds on the Brit!

25:17.766 --> 25:18.858
100 on the Negro.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.103
Two hundred.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.567
Same here.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.066
Five hundred.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.163
Ted, take these bets.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.251
If the American wins,
you'll be cleaned out.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.287
If he wins.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.582
FRANK:
What are you drinking?

25:41.749 --> 25:42.796
Champagne!

25:42.958 --> 25:43.880
Champagne.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.670
Allow me.

25:45.836 --> 25:46.712
Round one!

25:48.672 --> 25:49.924
(bell rings)

25:50.090 --> 25:51.012
Fight!

25:59.224 --> 26:01.192
Let's go, Joe!

26:04.730 --> 26:06.152
Come on, Joe!

26:07.399 --> 26:08.696
Dig in!

26:10.194 --> 26:11.992
Oh, it's beautiful!

26:15.324 --> 26:17.873
A proper mansion,
just like home.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.161
You can't swing a cat
in ours.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.705
Well, you should move.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.339
You're earning well.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.717
Both career women,
us Hawkins girls.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.336
It's a shame Frank
couldn't be here.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.300
Well, he's Harry's
right-hand man.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.515
That's the price
of success.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.520
Duty calls, day or night.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.272
(laughing)

26:42.559 --> 26:44.027
ROSIE:
Come on, Joe!

26:44.186 --> 26:45.278
That's it, Joe.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.488
Come on, Tommy, sit up!

26:50.651 --> 26:51.948
He's got him.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.158
That's it, Joe.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.321
Get him against the ropes!

26:54.488 --> 26:56.331
ROSIE:
He's got him!

26:59.326 --> 27:00.748
REFEREE:
Break, break, break!

27:00.911 --> 27:02.163
(bell rings)

27:02.329 --> 27:04.081
Corners, gents, corners.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.000
Well done, Joe!

27:06.166 --> 27:07.338
(laughs)

27:07.501 --> 27:08.798
So what are you doing here
in London?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.588
Parties.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.597
Cocktails.

27:12.756 --> 27:13.803
BOTH:
Baccarat.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.890
We'll need looking after.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.144
I could lose my shirt!

27:19.388 --> 27:20.264
If you're lucky.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.773
(laughs)

27:21.932 --> 27:23.024
And we want to get
into movies.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.309
Talkies.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.149
That's the future.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.234
Well, I know a few producers
and they would love to meet you.

27:31.608 --> 27:32.484
You're an angel.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.113
Thank you.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.829
They don't take prisoners,
do they?

27:39.992 --> 27:42.040
I think they're
great fun.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.545
ROSIE:
To our future, Harry.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.417
REFEREE:
Seconds away!

27:48.584 --> 27:49.801
Round three!

27:49.960 --> 27:50.927
(bell rings)

27:51.086 --> 27:52.929
Let's go, Joe!

27:53.088 --> 27:54.681
He's looking tired!

27:54.840 --> 27:56.467
We nearly got him!

28:11.607 --> 28:12.403
You can go now.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.403
Let's wind the gramophone up.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.788
There was something
we wanted to tell you.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.132
We're expecting a baby.

28:29.291 --> 28:31.714
(laughing)

28:31.877 --> 28:33.504
A baby?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.388
Yeah, we've been trying
for a while.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.800
We thought we'd keep it quiet
until we had some news.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.310
I had no idea.

28:44.473 --> 28:48.444
We wanted you to be
the first to know.

28:48.602 --> 28:49.478
Yeah.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.154
Congratulations!

29:03.867 --> 29:05.460
You're going to be
a mother!

29:05.619 --> 29:08.247
Auntie Kitty.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.420
HARRY:
That's it!

29:17.839 --> 29:18.681
Come on, Joe!

29:18.840 --> 29:19.716
Looking good!
Come on!

29:22.344 --> 29:23.095
(laughs)

29:23.262 --> 29:24.354
Don't let him off the hook!

29:26.306 --> 29:28.104
Let him have it, that's it!

29:28.267 --> 29:30.861
Keep an eye on it.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.271
Looks like a win for America.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.531
That's it, Joe, keep it up!

29:39.069 --> 29:40.241
There you go!

29:46.868 --> 29:47.744
Get up, Joe!

29:49.246 --> 29:50.498
Come on, Joe!

29:50.664 --> 29:51.961
Get up!

29:52.124 --> 29:54.001
Four, five, six...

29:57.004 --> 29:58.472
...nine, ten!

29:58.630 --> 29:59.506
Out!

30:03.302 --> 30:07.102
(cheering)

30:17.482 --> 30:18.358
ROSIE:
What's the matter?

30:18.525 --> 30:22.780
She's just lost
500 pounds.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.368
I guess we'll win it back.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.158
I guess we'll have to.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.627
What a good fight.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.386
Not for me.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.514
I'll pay.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.014
Harry, you can't.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.677
No, no, no, no need.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.719
Forget it.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.639
500 pounds?

30:48.805 --> 30:50.728
Yeah, you've made me
five times that tonight.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.234
Once you put all that
on the Yank,

30:52.392 --> 30:54.645
people followed suit.

30:54.811 --> 30:55.983
You're my shining knight!

30:56.146 --> 30:57.022
Just keep it quiet.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.408
Come and have a drink.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.076
I'm glad
we made you money.

31:12.496 --> 31:13.372
I mean it!

31:18.001 --> 31:19.924
♪♪

31:30.472 --> 31:31.564
JIMMY:
Madame Rennard.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.067
It's been an absolute
pleasure to meet you.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.069
I'm sure we'll see
a lot more of each other.

31:36.228 --> 31:36.854
Will we?

31:37.020 --> 31:37.862
You're beautiful,

31:38.021 --> 31:38.988
I've got money.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.820
I'd say it's almost inevitable.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.826
I'd say you're making
a lot of assumptions.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.612
Then tell me I'm wrong.

31:48.281 --> 31:49.703
Everything all right?
Marvelous.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.163
I was talking to Mae.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.202
Oh, I see.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.541
You two are...

31:55.122 --> 31:56.965
No, no, we're not together.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.046
Then she's not your concern.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.340
That's none
of your business.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.131
She is quite capable of speaking
for herself, thank you.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.145
So, Mr. Dillon,
you've made a fortune tonight.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.098
And a British victory.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.981
These colored chaps
put on a good show,

32:17.144 --> 32:19.067
but they never
last the course.

32:19.229 --> 32:20.151
Good night.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.571
HARRY:
What a charming man.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.784
So, where are we going now?

32:27.946 --> 32:28.947
Well, I'm going home.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.240
Mae, wait.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.159
No, I'll see you next week, Harry.
Mae.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.714
Can we all fit
in your car?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.090
(chuckling)

32:40.750 --> 32:41.876
(knocking lightly)

32:42.043 --> 32:43.920
Father?

32:44.087 --> 32:45.384
Shouldn't you be
in bed?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.890
Could I find a Saturday job?

32:51.052 --> 32:53.350
I could do it
as well as teach.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.935
Doing what?

32:55.098 --> 32:58.193
Working at Selfridges.

32:59.436 --> 33:00.733
No.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.318
Those shop girls
are exposed

33:02.481 --> 33:05.200
to all kinds of influences
and individuals.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.611
I want to work in Selfridges,
not an opium den.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.871
I've had enough.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.533
A school environment is best.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.542
And you will do as I say.

33:16.036 --> 33:19.791
If mother were here,
she'd understand.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.432
LOIS: What time
do you call this?

33:40.393 --> 33:42.145
Back in Jackson, you used
to take your shoes off

33:42.312 --> 33:43.188
before you crept in late.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.902
And you still heard me.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.863
I hear everything.

33:49.736 --> 33:50.953
Oh, you're cold.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.285
And you're not
a young man anymore.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.450
Where were you?

33:55.617 --> 33:57.961
The club.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.666
Gambling?

33:59.829 --> 34:02.048
Not as much as some.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.459
I took Mae out.

34:03.625 --> 34:04.842
I thought it would distract her.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.299
Why don't you ask her round
to dinner?

34:07.462 --> 34:10.261
We'd be very happy to see her.

34:10.422 --> 34:12.096
She could be good for you,

34:12.259 --> 34:15.308
if you let her.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.193
(conversing softly)

34:31.820 --> 34:32.286
(whispering):
Harry.

34:32.445 --> 34:32.911
Excuse me.

34:33.071 --> 34:33.947
Hello.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.083
I want to say thank you.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.835
But I can't do it.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.918
The fashion line?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.422
Well, no, any of it.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.927
I can't live in your flat

34:47.085 --> 34:51.556
and wear the dresses
that you bought me.

34:51.715 --> 34:54.889
When we were at Colleano's,
I realized how everyone sees me:

34:55.051 --> 34:56.678
a woman with a rich man
to take care of her.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.894
Who cares what people think?

35:00.056 --> 35:01.899
I can't live
like that anymore, Harry.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.028
I've got to learn to stand
on my own two feet.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.234
So I have to sell my shares.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.698
I'm sorry.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.111
I'm sorry.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.450
You know what I realized?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.115
I need a friend.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.454
You have lots of friends.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.711
Someone who really knows me.

35:20.869 --> 35:21.870
I need you.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.174
Harry.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.256
The press list--
the Queen of Time unveiling.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.214
You are coming?

35:30.337 --> 35:32.214
Well, that's why I'm here.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.384
Colleano's was a riot,
wasn't it?

35:35.550 --> 35:38.429
What did you think
of Jimmy Dillon?

35:38.595 --> 35:40.472
Victor tells me
he's the son

35:40.639 --> 35:41.481
of a Maharajah.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.063
He grew up in a mansion
in the country.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.442
His mother was English,
one of the county set.

35:45.602 --> 35:49.573
They had this affair,
quite the scandal.

35:49.731 --> 35:52.405
So that's how he got his money--
his father?

35:52.567 --> 35:53.944
No, the Maharajah died,

35:54.110 --> 35:56.363
leaving Jimmy and his mother
with nothing.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.951
He made it all himself.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.115
Somehow.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.374
Do you mind if we go through
the press list?

36:00.533 --> 36:03.628
Oh, no, please do.

36:03.787 --> 36:04.913
See you later, Harry.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.297
Mae...

36:06.456 --> 36:07.753
Think about the job.

36:07.916 --> 36:08.792
Please.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.756
I don't want you to go.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.813
I'm gonna catch you, Ernest!

36:24.307 --> 36:25.524
Or can you catch me?

36:25.684 --> 36:29.154
Alice, will you please control
your younger brother?

36:29.312 --> 36:31.155
Chief!

36:32.857 --> 36:35.736
They've all come to see
the unveiling of the new clock.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.950
This is Ernest.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.831
Alice, Eleanor.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.582
This is Meryl.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.664
And Arthur's
away at school.

36:43.827 --> 36:44.669
You must be the eldest.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.626
Mr. Selfridge.

36:46.788 --> 36:47.664
I remember when you were born.

36:47.831 --> 36:48.673
How old are you now?

36:48.832 --> 36:49.628
Nineteen.

36:49.791 --> 36:50.633
Nineteen?

36:50.792 --> 36:52.840
You look so much like
your mother.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.389
I've promised Ernest

36:56.548 --> 36:59.848
a turn around the toy
department, didn't I?

37:00.009 --> 37:02.103
Why don't you take
the girls to Fashion?

37:03.430 --> 37:04.522
My treat.

37:04.681 --> 37:05.898
Thank you, Chief.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.229
Well, come on, come on.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.195
Mr. Selfridge,
could you sign this?

37:11.354 --> 37:14.028
Ah, Ernest, Eleanor,

37:14.190 --> 37:16.158
I don't want you choosing
anything too expensive.

37:16.317 --> 37:17.910
No sequins
or anything like that.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.243
Very kind
of the Chief to offer.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.408
Meryl, come on.

37:23.575 --> 37:24.451
Meryl?

37:25.660 --> 37:26.536
Mr. Selfridge?

37:26.703 --> 37:28.922
Yes?

37:29.080 --> 37:31.629
May I ask you something?

37:31.791 --> 37:33.293
Of course.

37:35.795 --> 37:39.516
My mother was about my age

37:39.674 --> 37:41.267
when she started working
at Selfridges.

37:44.554 --> 37:45.931
I'd love a job here.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.271
Have you asked your father?

37:49.434 --> 37:51.937
I've tried.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.865
My daughter Violette asked me
for a job here,

37:56.024 --> 37:57.071
and I said no.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.361
I was wrong.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.539
We may need some extra help
in Fashion.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.416
I love Fashion.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.168
I read all the magazines.

38:07.327 --> 38:08.749
You'll need your father's
permission.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.550
I just had to ask him.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.184
Please don't be angry.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.681
You are my eldest child.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.100
First to talk and walk.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.564
And answer back.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.570
First to do everything.

38:37.774 --> 38:40.277
I just want
what's best for you.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.246
I haven't
anyone else to ask.

38:47.408 --> 38:50.753
Maybe I know what's best.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.960
And if I don't,
I'll learn.

38:58.127 --> 39:02.724
You know, your mother had such
fond memories of this place.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.226
She'd be so happy
to see you here now.

39:08.388 --> 39:09.890
All grown up.

39:26.155 --> 39:27.372
Lord Wynnstay.

39:27.532 --> 39:30.081
You've got quite
a crowd outside.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.462
And some press,
you'll be glad to know.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.917
Can I get you anything?

39:34.080 --> 39:35.252
No, we're fine,
thank you.

39:35.415 --> 39:38.089
Frank tells me
you have a story.

39:38.251 --> 39:39.377
About my family.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.922
Your son-in-law Serge.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.343
He has had an affair
with a countess.

39:48.094 --> 39:51.894
Her husband's been in South
Africa for more than a year.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.684
They must have thought
no one was looking.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.900
So it's gossip piece?

39:58.062 --> 40:01.111
Serge has fallen out
with the countess,

40:01.274 --> 40:03.902
but she's very happy to talk.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.160
Pa!

40:05.320 --> 40:06.196
Rosalie.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.329
Lord Wynnstay.

40:10.491 --> 40:11.538
The newspaper magnate.

40:11.701 --> 40:12.577
How do you do.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.418
Rosalie is married to Serge.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.959
Harry, those interviewers are
in your office, I need you.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.173
Thank you.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.212
Excuse me.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.884
Do you know Serge?

40:28.051 --> 40:30.679
I've heard of him.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.268
Oh, he knows so many people.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.308
I'm going to see him soon
in Paris.

40:35.475 --> 40:36.351
Such a beautiful city.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.393
Have you been?

40:37.560 --> 40:39.358
Once.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.148
It was full of Frenchmen.

40:42.315 --> 40:43.282
(laughs)

40:43.441 --> 40:45.239
Our daughter's excited.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.369
She's nine,
loves traveling.

40:47.528 --> 40:48.575
Do you have children?

40:48.738 --> 40:50.285
No.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.746
My mother had four.

40:52.909 --> 40:55.958
Still, one is a blessing.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.589
I'm sure.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.256
Shall we go find
a good spot outside?

41:02.418 --> 41:03.260
Please.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.840
Let's see what spectacle
your Pa has for us.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.889
Mr. Grove!

41:11.052 --> 41:14.682
I need to talk to you
about a personal matter.

41:14.847 --> 41:19.694
Mr. Towler and I
are expecting a baby.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.856
Oh, congratulations!

41:23.022 --> 41:25.650
Yes, but I want to work
as long <i>as</i> I can.

41:25.817 --> 41:30.118
Give you time to find
a new Head of Fashion.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.748
Well, we shall miss you.

41:32.907 --> 41:33.783
Oh!

41:33.950 --> 41:34.997
But I have no doubt

41:35.159 --> 41:37.287
you and George will make
wonderful parents.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.205
Thank you.

41:47.463 --> 41:48.339
Mr. Gordon.

41:48.506 --> 41:49.382
Mr. Keen?

41:49.549 --> 41:50.766
From the London Civic.

41:50.925 --> 41:51.801
How do you do?

41:51.968 --> 41:54.141
Very well, thank you.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.395
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.273
Before you go any further,

41:57.432 --> 41:59.935
you do realize I don't have
anything to do with the board.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.569
I don't work at the store.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.150
But you're managing director
of the provincial stores.

42:03.312 --> 42:05.110
On my father's behalf.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.616
Of course.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.823
And that makes you
very influential.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.533
So I just wanted to put a face
to a name.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.040
You are, after all,
Mr. Selfridge.

42:17.952 --> 42:18.828
(knocking)

42:18.995 --> 42:19.871
(door opens)

42:21.080 --> 42:21.956
Madame Rennard.

42:29.172 --> 42:31.095
I wasn't sure if you'd come.

42:33.885 --> 42:37.515
Harry, I know you want a friend.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.057
I've just got to protect myself.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.569
I feel like this might be
my last chance to start again.

42:43.728 --> 42:44.820
Then let me help.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.447
But we've never
worked together before.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.404
This would be a whole new
territory for us.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.284
I'm not offering you charity.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.330
It'll be on your terms.

42:54.489 --> 42:55.991
You've always liked
the high life.

42:56.157 --> 42:57.750
The women, and...

43:00.119 --> 43:02.042
...the gambling.

43:02.205 --> 43:03.127
I'm in control, Mae.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.836
Are you?

43:07.376 --> 43:08.548
I won't let you down.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.131
I promise.

43:15.468 --> 43:17.345
The press are waiting!

43:19.597 --> 43:22.441
Mae, will you join me?

43:32.401 --> 43:34.278
(trumpet and trombone playing)

43:40.034 --> 43:40.910
Can we stop the traffic,
please?

43:41.077 --> 43:41.669
Thank you.

43:43.996 --> 43:44.872
REPORTER: Come on, Mr.
Selfridge, you can tell us.

43:45.039 --> 43:45.915
What's the big surprise?

43:46.082 --> 43:47.425
All in good time.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.677
FRANK: I think the best
shot is about here!

43:49.836 --> 43:50.712
Indeed it is.

43:50.878 --> 43:51.970
Good afternoon.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.256
FRANK:
Thank you!

43:59.387 --> 44:00.809
(applause)

44:00.972 --> 44:03.646
Thank you all for coming!

44:08.563 --> 44:13.364
In 1909, Selfridges opened
its doors for the first time.

44:13.526 --> 44:19.158
Since then, we have gone
from strength to strength.

44:19.323 --> 44:24.500
It is with great pride
that I give to you

44:24.662 --> 44:26.585
the Queen of Time!

44:28.457 --> 44:31.711
(applause)

44:31.878 --> 44:33.721
(bulbs popping)

44:47.602 --> 44:48.854
(crowd gasping)
