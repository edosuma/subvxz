Oh, yeah?
What's, uh, Roger like?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.610
Super old,
die of natural causes?

07:54.810 --> 07:57.220
No, he was a leatherhead
football player,

07:57.420 --> 07:58.790
back in the day.

07:58.990 --> 08:00.920
Died running
into a goalpost.Oh...

08:01.120 --> 08:03.620
And he's just
absolutely ripped.

08:03.820 --> 08:05.970
Oh, that's...Yeah.

08:06.170 --> 08:06.840
...cool.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.190
He's really funny, too.

08:08.390 --> 08:10.020
He said this thing
to me the other day.

08:10.210 --> 08:12.500
He was all like...
[chuckles]

08:12.700 --> 08:15.330
[laughs nervously][laughing]

08:15.520 --> 08:18.980
I can't, I-I don't know.
You just had to be there.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.160
Right, right, right, but...
but I'm not there.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.810
I'm here.

08:23.010 --> 08:24.600
Uh. So he's big and funny, huh?

08:24.790 --> 08:26.510
Mm-hmm.
But also sensitive.

08:26.710 --> 08:29.560
And oddly smart,
which is surprising, you know,

08:29.760 --> 08:32.900
for someone who played
football and modeled.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.690
We have a hamster together.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.610
I mean, what happens to Bubbles?

08:38.810 --> 08:40.790
Freddie, if you don't feel up
to working today, it's okay.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.050
We understand.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.480
Yes, reward
this poor showing.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.140
That'll set him straight.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.270
Here, have a glass of water.
It'll make you feel better.

08:48.470 --> 08:50.800
I fear water may be
a sore subject.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.800
Oh, God, if only we'd drank tap

08:53.000 --> 08:54.890
none of this
would have happened.

08:55.090 --> 08:56.580
Okay, we need eyes
on this Beth chick.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.670
I mean, he's really sad,

08:58.870 --> 09:00.070
so there's a chance
she's super hot.

09:00.260 --> 09:01.940
I think I just need
to be alone for a bit.

09:02.140 --> 09:05.810
Indeed, and we'll go
watch you wallow.

09:06.010 --> 09:08.200
He's gonna pull up pictures,
I know it.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.860
Well, this is exactly what
I was afraid would happen.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.860
You have now ruined
your employee.

09:14.060 --> 09:15.600
I think you're being
a little dramatic.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.520
I'm just worried
about Bubbles.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.950
He's living
in a broken home, now.

09:18.150 --> 09:19.170
He's a hamster of divorce.

09:19.370 --> 09:22.090
Samantha,
you made a mistake

09:22.290 --> 09:24.130
by treating Freddie
with basic human decency.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.740
But you needn't compound it
by continuing to do so.

09:26.940 --> 09:28.620
His girlfriend just dumped him.

09:28.820 --> 09:30.660
It doesn't matter if
his girlfriend dumped him

09:30.860 --> 09:33.880
or his right arm was torn off
in an iron foundry.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.410
You need to tell him
to stop whining

09:35.600 --> 09:37.020
and put that stump to work.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.500
That sounded like
a disturbingly real example.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.840
I'm done listening to this.
[chuckles sarcastically]

09:43.140 --> 09:45.200
He couldn't handle
a simple phone call,

09:45.400 --> 09:47.200
and that's not
that difficult.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.810
I've done it.They had phones
back in your day?

09:49.010 --> 09:50.200
[sighs] Not many.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.290
In fact, we had
the only one for 300 miles.

09:52.490 --> 09:55.210
We had no one to call,
but we had bragging rights.

09:55.410 --> 09:59.080
Oh, the letters I would send
boasting about our telephone.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.520
♪ ♪

10:01.720 --> 10:02.820
I need you.

10:03.020 --> 10:06.350
Well, look who comes
crawling back...

10:06.550 --> 10:07.570
Not like that.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.000
I need you to do
something for me

10:09.200 --> 10:10.570
on Samantha's computer.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.490
Her assistant has become
a blubbering liability,

10:12.680 --> 10:13.920
and she refuses to do
anything about it.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.230
Okay.
So, what do we do?

10:15.430 --> 10:16.790
We intervene.

10:16.990 --> 10:18.360
And create a scenario
so egregious

10:18.560 --> 10:20.840
she has no choice but to become
the boss she needs to be

10:21.040 --> 10:23.240
and come down on him
once and for all.

10:23.430 --> 10:25.020
You were a really
tough boss, weren't you?

10:25.220 --> 10:27.540
I could be hard on a man
when they needed it.

10:27.740 --> 10:28.940
Okay, right there.

10:29.140 --> 10:30.810
I feel like you're
trying to be provocative.

10:31.010 --> 10:32.810
Oh, stop reading
into everything,

10:33.010 --> 10:34.380
you dirty little boy.

10:34.580 --> 10:37.420
Okay, come on!
That time for sure.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.990
So now Freddie's
girlfriend kicked him out

10:40.190 --> 10:41.690
and he's living
at his mom's house.

10:41.890 --> 10:43.080
Oh, so that means you won't
get to see your buddy,

10:43.280 --> 10:44.870
the football model,anymore.

10:45.070 --> 10:46.610
Unless they get
back together, yeah.

10:46.810 --> 10:48.260
That is tough.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.520
It's okay, though.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.000
There is this one other
really cool ghost

10:51.200 --> 10:52.660
that haunts the mom's house,
so that's nice.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.220
Oh, neat.
Uh, what's her name?

10:54.420 --> 10:56.220
His name is Chad.

10:56.420 --> 10:59.230
And he also died
in a car-related incident.

10:59.430 --> 11:02.100
He was doing a charity
car wash for his firehouse.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.500
And then he got hit by
a driver who got distracted

11:05.690 --> 11:06.500
by his washboard abs.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.150
Oh, come on!

11:08.350 --> 11:09.630
Wait, what's going on here?

11:09.830 --> 11:11.240
Are you jealous?

11:11.440 --> 11:13.150
What? No!

11:13.350 --> 11:15.370
Why? Should I be?
Is there something going on?

11:15.570 --> 11:17.460
Okay, you know, I really
don't like this side of you.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.510
Freddie and I have been
listening to podcasts

11:19.710 --> 11:21.030
about toxic relationships

11:21.230 --> 11:23.120
and I'm starting
to see some signs.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.730
Well, what do you expect?

11:24.930 --> 11:26.250
You're hanging out with
model football players

11:26.450 --> 11:29.260
and guys so hot people are
mowing them down.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.740
You're out there on the road,
living that road life.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.570
What?I know about road life.

11:33.770 --> 11:35.660
Okay?
I know all about it.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.570
I'd like you to
leave my RAV4.

11:37.770 --> 11:39.180
Oh, I'm going.

11:39.380 --> 11:40.910
[sighs]

11:41.910 --> 11:44.930
I can't believe how packed
we are this week.I know, right?

11:45.130 --> 11:46.270
Full capacity.

11:46.470 --> 11:48.020
I never thought
we'd see the day.

11:48.220 --> 11:50.150
Hey, just checking in.
It should be under Kubena.

11:50.350 --> 11:51.580
Here we go.

11:51.780 --> 11:53.150
Uh, there must be
some sort of some mistake.

11:53.350 --> 11:54.810
We're fully booked
this weekend.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.460
Oh, no, absolutely not.
We have a confirmation.

11:57.660 --> 11:59.510
All thanks to your
magic fingers, Trevor.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.680
Not the first time
you've said that.You shut up.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.510
Ah. Here it is.

12:03.710 --> 12:05.160
Oh, I see.
Oh, okay.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.340
Well, we'll clear
that right up.

12:06.540 --> 12:07.860
Um, where's Freddie?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.250
He's in the library,
making a collage

12:09.450 --> 12:11.780
out of construction paper
and photographs to give to Beth.

12:11.980 --> 12:13.390
A surefire way
to win her back.

12:13.590 --> 12:14.650
Good move, kid.

12:14.850 --> 12:16.090
Freddie! [chuckles]

12:16.290 --> 12:17.570
Yes?

12:17.770 --> 12:19.260
Uh, there seems to be
a little issue

12:19.460 --> 12:20.610
with the reservation system.

12:20.810 --> 12:22.440
We may have
double-booked a room.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.180
Um, that's not possible.

12:24.380 --> 12:26.050
HETTY:
Oh, did someone make
a critical error

12:26.250 --> 12:27.970
whilst in the midst of
an emotional breakdown?

12:28.170 --> 12:29.840
We <i>have</i>a reservation.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.060
Hey-hey, friends.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.500
Take it easy.
This weekend is about

12:33.700 --> 12:35.930
good jams and good jams
and good vibes.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.070
It says here we have
the Maple Suite for two nights.

12:39.270 --> 12:40.290
What the hell?
That's my room.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.500
You calling my wife a liar?

12:42.700 --> 12:43.720
Hi, I'm checking in.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.030
I have a reservation
for the Maple Suite.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.860
Get in line, dude!

12:47.060 --> 12:49.210
This is like how people fought
over toilets at Woodstock.

12:49.410 --> 12:52.300
Everyone loves sharing
until they have to poop.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.430
FREDDIE:The system isn't
supposed to allow this.

12:53.630 --> 12:54.690
It's taking on
a mind of its own,

12:54.890 --> 12:56.130
like Joshua in <i>WarGames.</i>

12:56.330 --> 12:57.390
[chuckles] Freddie,
you got to stop

12:57.590 --> 12:59.090
saying things
that make me like you

12:59.290 --> 13:00.440
'cause I'm starting
to get annoyed right now.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.440
I don't know
how this happened!

13:02.640 --> 13:03.700
HETTY:
Samantha, he's making
a fool of you

13:03.900 --> 13:05.350
and ruining your business.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.880
We demand a room right now.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.010
I want to shower and nap
before String Cheese Incident.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.580
Okay, I'm so sorry.

13:12.780 --> 13:14.100
Uh, we have a new employee

13:14.300 --> 13:15.710
and there seems to be
some sort of mix-up.

13:15.910 --> 13:17.930
Every place within 30 miles
of here is booked.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.720
My mom has a spare bedroom.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.540
They don't want to stay
at your mom's place, Freddie.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.460
It has a Murphy bed.I don't care.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.550
Yes, that's it, feel the anger
coursing through you.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.770
Why are you getting mad at me?
This isn't my fault.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.330
Well, then, whose fault is it?

13:29.530 --> 13:31.120
Well, since Beth
broke up with me--

13:31.320 --> 13:33.860
Oh, get over it, Freddie.
Things happen in people's lives.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.380
Finish him.

13:35.580 --> 13:36.950
I didn't tell you this,
but she took the hamster.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.260
She got Bubbles.Oh, my God.

13:38.460 --> 13:39.950
Buy another hamster.
They're all the same.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.650
[chuckles] He was
a really special rodent.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.220
That's not our problem.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.050
You messed up the whole
reservation system.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.440
I thought you were
a nice boss.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.350
And I thought you were
a good employee.

13:49.550 --> 13:51.400
You're right.
I am a bad employee.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.400
Ooh, Freddie, no.I don't deserve
to work here.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.530
I quit.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.480
Oh, that was better
than cocaine.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.280
You yelled at Freddie
and he quit?

14:06.480 --> 14:07.810
Sasappis, do not guilt Samantha.
She did the right thing.

14:08.010 --> 14:09.370
My girlfriend lives in his car.

14:09.570 --> 14:11.070
Yeah, she live in landship.

14:11.270 --> 14:13.030
He just said car.
You can't repeat "car"?

14:13.230 --> 14:14.380
It's like you don't
want to learn.

14:14.580 --> 14:15.990
Thor don't like your hat.[gasps]

14:16.190 --> 14:17.600
I'm sorry, Sass.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.730
I liked Freddie, but he made
a really big mistake.

14:18.930 --> 14:20.340
This is so unfair.

14:20.540 --> 14:21.870
You guys are the worst Livings.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.480
[groaning]

14:23.670 --> 14:24.780
I wish I could slam a door!

14:24.980 --> 14:27.090
That's interesting.What is?

14:27.290 --> 14:28.700
Well, I can see when
changes were made

14:28.900 --> 14:30.220
to the reservation system

14:30.420 --> 14:31.960
and someone changed
the maximum occupancy

14:32.160 --> 14:33.830
at 9:38 last night.

14:34.030 --> 14:35.840
But Freddie
wasn't here that late.I know.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.320
Well, why dwell
in the past?

14:38.520 --> 14:41.410
I think we should all focus
on this car commercial.

14:41.610 --> 14:44.540
Yah, cool landship.[quietly]:
Oh, my God.

14:44.740 --> 14:47.020
Yeah, somebody changed
the maximum number of rooms

14:47.220 --> 14:49.110
from four to...

14:49.310 --> 14:50.620
sixty-nine.

14:52.060 --> 14:53.460
Hetty made me do it.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.290
You spineless coward!

14:55.490 --> 14:57.030
Dammit, Trevor.Yeah, Trev-dog,
you had to know

14:57.230 --> 14:59.730
that this would
lead back to you.

14:59.930 --> 15:02.470
It is the best joke.
I will not apologize.

15:02.670 --> 15:03.820
Hetty, why would you do this?

15:04.020 --> 15:06.170
You refused to take action.

15:06.370 --> 15:09.220
I had to create a situation
that would force your hand.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.040
Freddie was
on a downward spiral

15:11.240 --> 15:12.180
and he was gonna
take you with him.

15:12.380 --> 15:15.040
If anything,
you should be thanking me.

15:16.690 --> 15:18.790
"Freddie" also made
a reservation for

15:18.990 --> 15:21.400
Mr. and Mrs. Seymour Butts.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.010
[laughing]

15:23.210 --> 15:25.970
Oh, come on.
That's objectively funny.

15:26.170 --> 15:29.150
Hey, roomie.Pete, I'm really not
in the mood right now.

15:29.350 --> 15:30.150
Oh.

15:30.350 --> 15:31.940
I'm sorry, is it 1971

15:32.130 --> 15:34.150
and are you Carol on our
wedding night? [chuckles]

15:34.350 --> 15:36.330
Oh, in retrospect,
the signs were there.

15:36.530 --> 15:37.720
What do you want?

15:37.920 --> 15:39.290
Uh, I wanted to tell you

15:39.490 --> 15:40.680
that Jay and Sam are gonna
try to hire Freddie back.

15:40.880 --> 15:41.990
It doesn't matter.

15:42.190 --> 15:43.560
I already blew it
with Jessica.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.300
I got super jealous
and she got really mad.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.940
Hmm, I see.

15:48.940 --> 15:49.740
You want some advice?

15:49.930 --> 15:52.650
From you?
About women?

15:52.850 --> 15:54.700
I-I mean, sure.

15:54.900 --> 15:58.310
You know how you can tell 100%
if someone's cheating on you?

15:58.510 --> 15:59.960
You can't.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.570
That's the thing
about relationships.

16:01.770 --> 16:03.580
You know?
You... you have to trust.

16:03.770 --> 16:05.400
Now, in my case,
the trust wasn't warranted,

16:05.600 --> 16:08.450
but the alternative is
to let paranoia take over

16:08.650 --> 16:11.150
and ruin what could be
a good thing.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.590
That actually makes
a lot of sense.

16:13.780 --> 16:15.200
Thanks, Pete.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.330
Anytime, roomie.

16:17.530 --> 16:19.290
Hey, did your wife
really not want to have sex

16:19.490 --> 16:20.370
on your wedding night?

16:20.570 --> 16:21.680
It was a long day.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.290
We had cake.Okay.

16:23.490 --> 16:24.420
It was hot out.We don't have to
talk about it.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.810
We had cake!

16:27.850 --> 16:28.910
Samantha,
may I have a moment?

16:29.100 --> 16:30.950
No, I don't want
to talk to you.

16:31.150 --> 16:33.260
You sabotaged my business,
all to get me

16:33.460 --> 16:35.350
to yell at that poor kid
who did nothing wrong.

16:35.550 --> 16:39.570
I was trying to impart
what I believed to be wisdom.

16:39.770 --> 16:42.010
We just had to beg
Freddie to come back.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.920
This place was jammed
with angry jam-jam fans.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.790
The-the point is,
you went way too far.

16:46.990 --> 16:48.090
Hetty, what were you thinking?

16:51.530 --> 16:54.580
I was not the best mother.

16:54.780 --> 16:58.980
I delegated the care and raising
of my children to others.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.810
And I missed out on being
a part of their lives.

17:02.010 --> 17:04.290
And then, after my death,
I had to watch my children

17:04.490 --> 17:05.890
become adults in this house.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.760
Unable to help them.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.560
To give advice...

17:11.760 --> 17:13.210
to guide them.

17:13.410 --> 17:16.390
Mother, what do you think
I should do?

17:16.590 --> 17:18.780
Should I marry this girl?
Is she the one?

17:18.980 --> 17:21.000
No, she is
a money-grubbing harlot.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.350
Her family is landless
and striving.

17:23.550 --> 17:26.220
Just give me a sign.
Any sign.On it.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.490
[groans][electricity buzzes]

17:27.680 --> 17:29.360
Whoa.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.450
Okay, I will marry her.
[chuckles softly]

17:31.650 --> 17:32.580
No!

17:32.780 --> 17:34.710
Thomas!

17:34.910 --> 17:36.800
What the hell, Thorfinn?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.580
I was doing sign for "no."

17:38.780 --> 17:40.670
But can see where...
confusing.

17:40.870 --> 17:42.370
D'you think?

17:42.570 --> 17:44.940
I have watched
generations of Woodstones

17:45.140 --> 17:47.200
make mistakes in this house.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.900
But then, after 100 years,
a miracle happened.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.600
You fell down those stairs,
and I was given a second chance.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.030
To be heard.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.130
You know, my mom used
to point out my mistakes.

18:03.330 --> 18:04.650
A lot.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.090
We would get
into these huge fights

18:07.290 --> 18:08.870
and I would do the opposite
of what she said.

18:09.070 --> 18:10.270
And because of that I...

18:10.470 --> 18:13.750
I probably missed out
on some good advice.

18:13.950 --> 18:17.710
Well, maybe this is
a second chance for both of us.

18:17.910 --> 18:20.450
That's a nice way
to think of it.

18:20.650 --> 18:22.500
So, you'll agree to always
listen to me from now on?

18:22.700 --> 18:25.240
Only if you agree to let me
make my own mistakes

18:25.440 --> 18:27.200
when I disagree, because
sometimes they're not mistakes

18:27.400 --> 18:28.890
and I know
what I'm talking about.

18:29.090 --> 18:31.330
In retrospect,
I can see that you were

18:31.530 --> 18:33.380
slightly more in tune with
the fragile constitution

18:33.580 --> 18:35.950
of the modern worker.Thank you.

18:36.140 --> 18:37.730
But also,
for what it's worth,

18:37.930 --> 18:40.170
you seemed to be quite at home
disciplining that young man.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.390
I mean, you really
laid into him.

18:42.590 --> 18:43.780
It felt so good.
[chuckles]

18:43.980 --> 18:46.830
There are those
Woodstone genes.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.350
You know, I actually
wanted to strangle him.

18:49.550 --> 18:50.740
Ooh...

18:50.940 --> 18:53.310
That's probably
frowned upon these days.

18:53.510 --> 18:55.090
<i>Huh.</i>
<i>And they call that progress.</i>

19:01.090 --> 19:02.710
Hey, you got a sec?

19:02.910 --> 19:04.540
Well, I was gonna walk
to the other side of the car,

19:04.740 --> 19:06.410
but I guess
I can do that later.

19:06.610 --> 19:07.850
Look, I'm sorry.

19:08.050 --> 19:10.760
I know I'm 500 years old,
but I'm, ironically,

19:10.960 --> 19:12.980
kind of new to all
this dating stuff.

19:13.180 --> 19:15.110
If you think mentioning
that you're super old

19:15.310 --> 19:18.290
is feeding into my daddy
issues right now, then...

19:18.490 --> 19:19.640
you're right.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.590
It is. I like it.
It's super hot.

19:22.590 --> 19:24.690
The thing is,
I got jealous.

19:24.890 --> 19:27.170
But that's my problem.
Not yours.

19:27.370 --> 19:28.650
Okay, well,
for what it's worth,

19:28.850 --> 19:30.780
I'm not hooking up
with other ghosts.

19:30.980 --> 19:33.920
Really? I mean,
thank you for saying that.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.300
I... I trust you.

19:36.390 --> 19:37.660
Aw...

19:37.860 --> 19:39.300
Come here,
you big cutie.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.310
Cool.

19:43.830 --> 19:45.840
What did Beth think
of the collage?

19:46.040 --> 19:47.630
Oh, I don't know,
I haven't heard back yet.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.190
Oh, you will.

19:49.390 --> 19:50.850
But a collage well done
is its own reward.

19:51.050 --> 19:52.890
Anyway, we're just glad
to have you back.Yeah.

19:53.090 --> 19:55.460
Oh, I'm glad to be back.
It is crazy, though.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.850
I mean, I checked
the security footage

19:58.050 --> 20:01.070
and no one even approached
the laptop at 9:38.

20:01.270 --> 20:02.600
So weird, right?

20:02.800 --> 20:04.120
That's spooky.
[chuckles softly]

20:04.320 --> 20:06.290
It is spooky.

20:08.110 --> 20:09.950
♪ ♪

20:10.150 --> 20:11.210
Huh.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.000
That's odd.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.830
The keys are
clicking themselves.

20:18.030 --> 20:20.000
Yeah, he's gonna have
questions about that.
