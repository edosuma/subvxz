<i>Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...</i>

00:03.076 --> 00:04.938
- I'm Emma, by the way.
- Lily.

00:04.968 --> 00:06.839
While your precious Robin

00:06.869 --> 00:10.070
thinks it's his wide-eyed
wife, it's actually me.

00:10.104 --> 00:11.275
One phone call from me,

00:11.305 --> 00:13.540
and your beloved dies at
the hands of your sister.

00:13.574 --> 00:15.742
Now forget all this and run along home.

00:15.777 --> 00:17.246
So, I'm headed to New York now.

00:17.276 --> 00:20.117
And if you breathe one
word of this to Zelena,

00:20.147 --> 00:22.246
I take this heart and squeeze.

00:23.013 --> 00:24.484
(Mary Margaret): Cruella can't kill anyone.

00:24.669 --> 00:25.869
(David): Emma doesn't know.

00:25.903 --> 00:28.004
Which means Gold wants her to...

00:28.039 --> 00:29.039
(Whoosh)

00:29.073 --> 00:30.756
Aah!

00:56.060 --> 00:59.791
<i>What brings you here?</i>

00:59.837 --> 01:03.377
The Author... he has violated the rules.

01:03.407 --> 01:05.308
He has changed things.

01:06.193 --> 01:07.498
The savior...

01:07.528 --> 01:10.029
he made me channel her
potential for darkness

01:10.064 --> 01:11.528
into Maleficent's child.

01:12.231 --> 01:14.440
There must be a way to undo it.

01:14.668 --> 01:16.402
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

01:16.437 --> 01:19.605
<i>What's done is done, my apprentice.</i>

01:19.640 --> 01:21.851
But what now of the girls, their fates?

01:21.881 --> 01:24.102
<i>Remain entwined,</i>

01:24.132 --> 01:27.614
<i>as they always were and always shall be.</i>

01:27.919 --> 01:28.919
Of course.

01:28.949 --> 01:32.039
<i>Our concern now is The Author.</i>

01:32.069 --> 01:34.024
I have taken care of that, master.

01:34.054 --> 01:36.043
Our mistake has been rectified.

01:36.073 --> 01:37.474
He is in the book,

01:38.008 --> 01:40.210
where he can no longer alter our world...

01:40.240 --> 01:41.799
only record what happens.

01:41.829 --> 01:45.198
<i>You must see to it there is no more damage.</i>

01:45.232 --> 01:51.090
<i>The Author must never be allowed
to toy with fate again.</i>

02:06.557 --> 02:08.178
I'll miss her.

02:08.806 --> 02:11.307
Furs and all, I'll miss her.

02:12.043 --> 02:14.143
She was good to me... in her way.

02:14.173 --> 02:15.949
Made me who I am.

02:16.752 --> 02:20.283
Well, someone had to die
at the savior's hands.

02:20.568 --> 02:21.861
Did they?

02:23.092 --> 02:27.089
We won't have what we need
to rewrite the book,

02:27.124 --> 02:28.479
to secure our happy endings,

02:28.509 --> 02:31.368
until Ms. Swan has completed her journey.

02:31.745 --> 02:35.915
The savior has taken the first
step down a dark path.

02:36.679 --> 02:39.675
And we have to make sure she stays on it...

02:40.551 --> 02:42.178
for both our sakes.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.057
(Emma): I'm going after Gold.

03:01.087 --> 03:02.929
He made this happen.
He needs to answer for it.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.293
Careful. Don't go off half-cocked.

03:04.327 --> 03:05.815
Hook's right. He wants you angry.

03:05.845 --> 03:06.796
Yeah, well, I am angry.

03:06.826 --> 03:08.378
That doesn't mean he's
gonna get what he's after.

03:08.408 --> 03:11.558
Do I wish I could change
what I did to Cruella? Yes.

03:11.604 --> 03:14.339
But that's regret, not darkness.

03:14.369 --> 03:16.869
I think we've all done things we regret.

03:17.451 --> 03:18.844
Right now, we need to focus on one thing...

03:18.874 --> 03:20.183
how to keep Gold and The Author

03:20.213 --> 03:21.547
from causing any more damage.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.256
I might be able to help with that.

03:25.198 --> 03:27.920
It now appears we have a common foe...

03:28.354 --> 03:29.888
Rumplestiltskin.

03:31.575 --> 03:33.075
He resurrected you.

03:33.105 --> 03:34.843
To help himself, not me.

03:35.031 --> 03:37.246
Cruella's death only confirmed that.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.082
Oh. Now you want to turn on him
before he turns on you.

03:40.116 --> 03:42.139
I knew Gold couldn't keep the dragon

03:42.169 --> 03:44.136
on her leash for long.

03:44.371 --> 03:45.475
What do you want?

03:45.505 --> 03:47.206
Nothing from you.

03:47.480 --> 03:51.243
But your daughter, I hear, has
a talent for finding people.

03:51.754 --> 03:53.345
Yeah, I do.

03:53.552 --> 03:55.152
Who do you want found?

03:55.567 --> 03:56.915
My daughter.

03:59.385 --> 04:00.552
She's alive?

04:00.586 --> 04:01.420
Yes.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.276
She survived the journey to this land...

04:03.306 --> 04:04.940
The journey you sent her on.

04:06.926 --> 04:08.481
You want to prevent Rumplestiltskin

04:08.511 --> 04:10.412
from achieving whatever he wants.

04:10.446 --> 04:13.315
What better way than leaving
this town and helping me?

04:13.498 --> 04:15.017
I'm not running away from Gold.

04:15.051 --> 04:17.983
It's not running from him.
It's hindering him.

04:19.805 --> 04:21.005
What do you know about her?

04:21.629 --> 04:23.742
Just what the Dark One showed me...

04:23.776 --> 04:26.611
that she was banished
to this world 30 years ago,

04:26.641 --> 04:29.014
to a place called Minnesota,

04:29.248 --> 04:31.416
where she was adopted by a couple.

04:31.551 --> 04:33.818
And they named her Lilith.

04:36.046 --> 04:37.122
No.

04:37.507 --> 04:39.774
Emma? What is it?

04:55.562 --> 04:57.240
_

05:03.225 --> 05:04.225
Lily.

05:05.584 --> 05:06.852
(Max): Mom said I could have it!

05:06.882 --> 05:08.674
- Flashlight...
- (Zach): No, she didn't!

05:08.704 --> 05:12.073
Batteries... Canteen...

05:12.108 --> 05:13.441
I want it! I want it, too!

05:13.476 --> 05:16.028
- Matches...
- Both of you... stop it!

05:16.058 --> 05:17.217
How's the checklist going, Em?

05:17.247 --> 05:18.334
Good, I think.

05:18.364 --> 05:20.069
Uh, what's "G.O.R.P."?

05:20.099 --> 05:23.219
"Good Old Raisins and Peanuts."
It's trail mix.

05:23.452 --> 05:25.541
Haven't you ever been camping before?

05:25.571 --> 05:28.377
I've never even been on a vacation before.

05:28.407 --> 05:29.707
Not everyone was lucky enough

05:29.742 --> 05:31.743
to grow up the way that
you and your brother have.

05:32.025 --> 05:33.455
Emma, we're just happy

05:33.485 --> 05:36.654
that you're gonna spend your
first family vacation with us.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.489
So am I.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.019
Oh. I almost forgot... Sleeping bag.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.361
- Oh.
- (Chuckles)

05:46.672 --> 05:48.041
(Clack)

06:00.820 --> 06:02.453
- Emma, wait.
- (Breathing heavily)

06:03.034 --> 06:04.388
Lily?

06:04.423 --> 06:05.870
What are you doing here?

06:05.900 --> 06:07.980
I know I'm probably

06:08.010 --> 06:09.652
the last person you want to see right now.

06:09.682 --> 06:13.685
But, I... didn't have anywhere else to go.

06:14.551 --> 06:15.937
What's wrong? What happened?

06:15.967 --> 06:17.105
It's bad, Emma.

06:17.639 --> 06:19.073
I know I've lied to you before,

06:19.107 --> 06:21.341
but I really need your help.

06:21.764 --> 06:23.115
Why should I trust you now?

06:23.145 --> 06:26.039
Because I am in big trouble.

06:26.198 --> 06:28.566
You once said we'd be friends forever.

06:28.885 --> 06:30.434
Did you mean it?

06:30.910 --> 06:32.103
'Cause I did.

06:33.548 --> 06:34.675
(Bill): Emma?

06:35.588 --> 06:36.907
Who's this?

06:37.869 --> 06:39.344
This is... Lily.

06:40.018 --> 06:41.746
My friend.

06:42.073 --> 06:44.319
You never told me that you had
friends in the neighborhood.

06:44.349 --> 06:46.751
- (Chuckling)
- My foster family just moved here.

06:46.785 --> 06:48.185
I thought I would surprise her.

06:48.220 --> 06:49.108
Ah.

06:49.301 --> 06:52.490
Well, Lily, would you like
to join us for dinner?

06:55.611 --> 06:58.329
Ain't fate a bitch?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.965
You know this girl.

07:01.346 --> 07:02.346
How?

07:03.975 --> 07:05.998
She was my friend.

07:06.958 --> 07:08.759
Oh, the one you told me about.

07:09.206 --> 07:11.629
Who you said you pushed away?

07:11.659 --> 07:13.076
How is this possible?

07:13.106 --> 07:14.832
Of all the kids in the world,
the one I end up friends with

07:14.866 --> 07:16.586
is the one my parents banished?

07:16.616 --> 07:19.583
Emma, there are powers
beyond our understanding,

07:19.613 --> 07:21.459
and your parents messed with them.

07:21.489 --> 07:22.961
So the only friend I ever had

07:22.991 --> 07:26.260
wasn't even my friend by choice.

07:26.941 --> 07:27.983
I know.

07:28.013 --> 07:30.247
It hurts, doesn't it?

07:30.432 --> 07:31.932
I've been there, too.

07:31.966 --> 07:33.789
- Yeah?
- You think it was a coincidence

07:33.819 --> 07:36.594
that I just so happened
to adopt the savior's son?

07:36.624 --> 07:40.324
Our actions are our own,
but fate pushes us.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.555
Maybe it's time to push back.

07:42.585 --> 07:43.780
How?

07:43.810 --> 07:44.775
Well, I have to go to New York

07:44.805 --> 07:47.209
to rescue Robin from my insane sister,

07:47.239 --> 07:50.528
and you have to find this
girl to redeem your parents

07:50.558 --> 07:52.693
and show Gold he's wrong about you...

07:52.727 --> 07:54.869
that he can't change you.

07:54.899 --> 07:56.676
What do you say we help each other?

07:56.706 --> 07:58.098
What, like a road trip?

07:58.133 --> 08:00.100
Well, if that's what you want to call it.

08:01.121 --> 08:03.574
I'm okay, Regina.
I don't need a babysitter.

08:04.639 --> 08:06.306
But maybe I need you.

08:06.633 --> 08:08.142
You lived in New York.

08:08.176 --> 08:10.644
I've barely been outside of Storybrooke.

08:11.746 --> 08:13.447
How about it, Swan?

08:28.763 --> 08:30.481
You're letting them leave town?

08:30.511 --> 08:31.687
For our purposes,

08:31.717 --> 08:34.967
where the savior turns dark
is of little consequence.

08:36.421 --> 08:37.732
I'm confident her latest mission

08:37.763 --> 08:42.330
will darken her heart faster
than we ever could.

08:46.328 --> 08:48.553
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:48.583 --> 08:51.133
there's something I need to take care of.

08:55.654 --> 08:56.724
(Emma): Be good, kid.

08:57.258 --> 08:59.208
I'll see you when I get back.

09:03.048 --> 09:05.116
Be careful, Swan.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.936
As someone who started on
the side of good and went dark,

09:08.970 --> 09:11.325
take my advice... Vengeance is tempting.

09:11.355 --> 09:13.307
The darkness always is.

09:13.341 --> 09:14.708
Resist it.

09:14.946 --> 09:16.214
Why couldn't you?

09:16.898 --> 09:18.846
I didn't have anything to live for.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.215
You have your parents, Henry...

09:21.301 --> 09:22.301
You.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.649
Aye... Me.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.453
And I, you.

09:26.655 --> 09:28.756
That's what's kept me on my path now.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.575
Use whatever it takes to stay on yours.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.607
- Emma...
- Take care of Henry.

09:41.936 --> 09:43.165
Of course.

09:44.650 --> 09:45.844
Did you get what you needed?

09:45.874 --> 09:48.947
I'm not going into a land without magic
without bringing some of our own.

09:49.077 --> 09:51.599
The Snow Queen's scroll...
in case we have any trouble

09:51.629 --> 09:53.585
getting through the cloak
put around this town.

09:53.615 --> 09:54.381
Sounds good.

09:54.411 --> 09:56.216
Let's get out of here.

09:57.571 --> 09:59.219
- (Cellphone chirps)
- (Sighs)

09:59.254 --> 10:01.254
What is it? Something on Lily?

10:01.943 --> 10:04.045
Yeah. One of my contacts found an address.

10:04.075 --> 10:05.842
But it's five years old.

10:08.062 --> 10:09.701
Emma, what is it?

10:09.731 --> 10:11.219
This is in Lowell, Massachusetts,

10:11.249 --> 10:13.638
which is less than 30 miles
outside of Boston,

10:13.668 --> 10:15.928
which is where I lived five years ago.

10:15.958 --> 10:18.960
Lily and I grew up in Minnesota,
separated as kids,

10:18.990 --> 10:21.505
and ended up living less
than an hour apart as adults?

10:21.535 --> 10:24.164
- (Exhales)
- Like I said... fate.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.801
You're connected. It's been
pushing you together.

10:26.831 --> 10:30.033
It may have been pushing
us together as kids, but...

10:30.368 --> 10:33.336
Last time I saw her, I'm the one
who pushed her away.

10:33.471 --> 10:36.278
What exactly happened between you two?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.695
(Sighs)

10:39.725 --> 10:42.603
(Engine turns over)

10:43.672 --> 10:47.322
We are thankful Lily could
join us to be our guest,

10:47.352 --> 10:50.840
and let these gifts to us be blessed.

10:50.870 --> 10:51.621
Amen.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.347
- (Katie): Amen.
- (Emma): Amen.

10:54.051 --> 10:56.964
Sorry about the takeout,
but with all the packing...

10:56.994 --> 10:58.199
- Hey, I love it.
- (Chuckles)

10:58.229 --> 10:59.750
The whole vibe.

10:59.780 --> 11:03.321
Homework, chore wheel, house rules.

11:03.351 --> 11:05.285
Like Norman Rockwell blew up in this place.

11:05.319 --> 11:07.575
(Light laughter)

11:09.235 --> 11:11.758
Emma seems really lucky
to have ended up with you guys.

11:11.793 --> 11:14.191
Well, we are lucky to have
Emma in our family.

11:14.486 --> 11:15.792
(Chuckles)

11:16.774 --> 11:18.041
What's that?

11:18.175 --> 11:20.543
Max. That's not polite.

11:20.778 --> 11:23.776
It's okay. It's just a birthmark.

11:24.531 --> 11:27.168
So, Lily, tell us, how
did you and Emma meet?

11:27.198 --> 11:28.610
It was a group home?

11:28.932 --> 11:31.834
Uh... Yeah... back in Falcon Heights.

11:32.303 --> 11:33.736
We hit it right off.

11:33.771 --> 11:35.271
Best friends forever.

11:35.306 --> 11:36.639
(Bill): It's a shame you two were split up.

11:36.986 --> 11:37.986
Yeah.

11:39.008 --> 11:41.851
Emma was the first person
who ever really understood me,

11:41.881 --> 11:43.646
you know?

11:43.822 --> 11:46.583
Like we were meant to come
into each other's lives.

11:46.806 --> 11:48.714
Can, uh, we get seconds?

11:51.188 --> 11:53.407
Max, can you pass me the gravy, please?

11:55.409 --> 11:56.814
What are you doing?

11:56.844 --> 11:57.894
Making a good impression.

11:57.924 --> 12:00.717
By lying to my foster parents
about how we met?

12:00.747 --> 12:02.481
Would you rather I told them the truth...

12:02.516 --> 12:03.754
that you were shoplifting pop-tarts

12:03.784 --> 12:04.889
and I was giving you tips?

12:04.919 --> 12:06.323
I was hungry and...

12:06.353 --> 12:08.020
I mean, that's not the point.

12:08.055 --> 12:10.460
I'm finally in a good situation.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.224
I don't want to mess it up.

12:12.259 --> 12:14.765
Yeah. No, it's nice here.

12:14.795 --> 12:18.168
(Reporter): <i>In skyline, a local tom thumb
robbed by two armed assailants</i>

12:18.198 --> 12:20.532
<i>is the subject of an intense
police investigation.</i>

12:20.567 --> 12:23.740
<i>Both suspects had their
faces obscured by masks.</i>

12:23.770 --> 12:25.475
<i>If you have any information,</i>

12:25.505 --> 12:28.307
<i>please call the Mankato we-tip hotline.</i>

12:28.342 --> 12:30.076
I can explain.

12:30.110 --> 12:33.679
(<i>Female reporter talking indistinctly</i>)

12:33.714 --> 12:37.284
(Siren wailing in distance)

12:37.314 --> 12:39.618
(Baby crying, indistinct arguing)

12:39.653 --> 12:43.034
(Man coughing)

12:43.840 --> 12:46.613
Why did I go through the trouble
of creating Storybrooke

12:46.643 --> 12:49.866
when I could have cursed
everyone to live here?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.198
(Crying continues)

12:53.533 --> 12:54.533
(Knock on door)

12:54.568 --> 12:55.534
(Clears throat)

12:55.799 --> 12:56.799
Yeah?

13:00.156 --> 13:02.012
Oh. Sorry to disturb you.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.097
We're just looking for Lilith Page.

13:04.127 --> 13:05.449
Is she around?

13:05.479 --> 13:07.446
No, she ain't around.

13:07.730 --> 13:09.257
Not for years.

13:09.287 --> 13:10.337
You know where she moved?

13:10.367 --> 13:12.105
Lady, she ain't moving nowhere.

13:12.135 --> 13:13.185
She's dead.

13:15.357 --> 13:17.727
- What?
- Car wreck a couple years back.

13:17.757 --> 13:19.496
Pretty sure she was drunk.

13:19.526 --> 13:21.181
Not that anyone missed her.

13:21.211 --> 13:22.978
I mean, she was a weird one.

13:23.013 --> 13:24.331
Kept to herself.

13:24.361 --> 13:26.016
'Course, she had one of those personalities

13:26.046 --> 13:28.714
that you wanted to stay far away from.

13:28.899 --> 13:30.566
A real loser.

13:31.282 --> 13:32.919
- She was my friend!
- Emma! Emma!

13:32.949 --> 13:33.804
(Grunts)

13:33.834 --> 13:35.267
Emma.

13:35.599 --> 13:37.187
It's not worth it.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.574
(Gasping)

13:41.708 --> 13:42.708
Hey.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.577
You okay?

13:44.726 --> 13:47.671
I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine.

13:51.849 --> 13:54.238
So, uh, you sure you don't mind?

13:54.268 --> 13:57.605
David and Mary Margaret just
need me to watch the baby for a bit.

13:57.635 --> 13:59.069
(Chuckles)

14:00.324 --> 14:01.656
Bye.

14:04.115 --> 14:06.868
(Door opens, bells jingle, door closes)

14:10.234 --> 14:12.969
When you walk into a man's home...

14:14.472 --> 14:17.574
You should ask if you've been invited.

14:18.114 --> 14:20.915
If you've come here to hurt me,
you best get on with it.

14:20.945 --> 14:23.580
But I warn you... I'm scrappy.

14:24.270 --> 14:26.349
All right, scrappy.

14:26.383 --> 14:29.352
Believe it or not, you may be
of some use to me.

14:29.938 --> 14:33.110
You're a thief, and
I need something stolen.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.507
And what might that be?

14:34.542 --> 14:35.675
Belle's heart.

14:36.345 --> 14:37.811
Already in the process of doing that.

14:37.845 --> 14:39.005
Sorry, mate.

14:43.315 --> 14:48.960
As close as you think
you have grown to my wife,

14:48.990 --> 14:53.627
you're clearly not close
enough to realize the truth.

14:54.073 --> 14:56.872
Her heart is gone.

14:57.615 --> 15:00.268
You mean it was ripped out of her chest?

15:00.298 --> 15:02.322
Who the bloody hell would do that?

15:02.352 --> 15:03.857
Regina.

15:03.887 --> 15:05.855
She has her watchdog, Maleficent,

15:05.885 --> 15:08.224
caring for it in the Mayor's office.

15:08.258 --> 15:11.961
Now I need you to go and get it back.

15:12.023 --> 15:13.263
Give it to you?

15:13.797 --> 15:15.014
Not likely, mate.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.751
No, you're mistaken.

15:19.081 --> 15:21.655
I'm not asking.

15:25.475 --> 15:27.215
Want to talk about what
happened back there?

15:27.245 --> 15:28.334
Nope.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.168
You nearly put that guy through a wall.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.154
Look, I know what you're thinking,

15:32.184 --> 15:35.022
but what happened back
there wasn't me turning dark.

15:35.052 --> 15:36.890
It was... mourning a friend.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.221
Can you understand that?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.122
Emma, you know you're not responsible

15:40.152 --> 15:41.212
for what happened to her.

15:41.242 --> 15:43.950
You sure? You heard what that guy said.

15:44.127 --> 15:46.296
Her life wasn't pretty. It was dark.

15:46.326 --> 15:48.064
That darkness was meant for me.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.421
Or could have been or...

15:50.451 --> 15:51.767
Emma!

15:52.619 --> 15:54.587
(Tires screech)

15:57.577 --> 16:00.843
(Breathing heavily)

16:01.888 --> 16:03.604
(Whimpers)

16:03.634 --> 16:05.304
(Groans)

16:07.951 --> 16:09.652
- You okay?
- (Car door closes)

16:10.036 --> 16:11.208
This has happened before,

16:11.238 --> 16:13.210
the wolf in the road and an accident...

16:13.240 --> 16:15.307
the first time I tried
to leave Storybrooke.

16:16.328 --> 16:18.097
Stop overthinking.

16:18.127 --> 16:20.863
It's not fate. It's just a flat.

16:20.893 --> 16:22.548
We need a new tire.

16:22.578 --> 16:25.722
Unless fate wants you to go
to the coffee mug diner for help,

16:25.752 --> 16:28.208
I'd chalk it up to "accidents will happen."

16:28.238 --> 16:29.676
I'll get a tire.

16:29.706 --> 16:31.392
You get some coffee.

16:41.453 --> 16:43.127
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:44.564 --> 16:47.594
Two cups of coffee and a pack of Advil.

16:47.624 --> 16:49.054
Make it two packs.

16:52.213 --> 16:53.383
Tough day?

16:53.413 --> 16:55.413
You don't know the half of it.

16:55.904 --> 16:57.904
I'll leave the pot here, then.

17:08.994 --> 17:10.345
I'll be right back with your Advil.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.867
(Regina): Car's being towed in.

17:15.176 --> 17:16.994
(Chair scrapes)

17:18.972 --> 17:20.239
What's wrong?

17:20.473 --> 17:21.823
See another wolf?

17:22.863 --> 17:24.233
It's...

17:24.577 --> 17:26.345
It's her.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.117
(Door opens)

17:28.146 --> 17:30.553
(Voice breaking) It was my
boyfriend's idea, okay? I swear.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.155
One minute, I think
we're making a snack run,

17:32.185 --> 17:33.585
and the next, he tosses a gun at me

17:33.619 --> 17:34.621
and tells me to watch the door.

17:34.651 --> 17:36.588
A gun?! Are you out of your mind?!

17:36.622 --> 17:38.042
You didn't have to go along with him!

17:38.072 --> 17:39.041
I know. I know.

17:39.075 --> 17:41.114
I-I don't know how to explain it.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.778
It doesn't matter what I do.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.891
It's like every decision I make
seems right, but it's wrong.

17:45.921 --> 17:46.819
You got to leave.

17:46.849 --> 17:48.775
The police are probably
looking for you right now.

17:48.805 --> 17:51.451
You're my only friend. I
don't have anywhere else to go.

17:51.481 --> 17:53.302
You can't stay here.

17:53.332 --> 17:55.033
Look, I've got some allowance stashed away.

17:55.068 --> 17:56.435
It'll be enough for a bus ticket.

17:56.469 --> 17:57.936
No, I can't leave without my stuff.

17:57.970 --> 18:00.192
It's at the house I was
squatting in with my boyfriend.

18:00.222 --> 18:02.262
Forget the stuff. Forget him.

18:02.292 --> 18:03.400
I'll give you some clothes.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.508
No, you don't understand...
there's this necklace,

18:05.538 --> 18:07.377
and it's the only thing I have
from my birth mother,

18:07.407 --> 18:09.995
and I cannot leave it behind.

18:10.025 --> 18:11.147
I can't.

18:11.493 --> 18:13.382
You got to help me.

18:13.412 --> 18:15.434
I would go, but my boyfriend

18:15.464 --> 18:17.999
is the last person I want to see right now.

18:19.045 --> 18:20.390
(Sighs)

18:20.866 --> 18:23.848
Okay. I'll get your necklace.

18:24.746 --> 18:26.654
But then you're gone!

18:44.985 --> 18:46.046
(Chimes tinkle)

18:47.730 --> 18:49.164
Hey. Starla.

18:50.449 --> 18:51.687
Is something wrong?

18:51.717 --> 18:53.651
Did I bring you decaf by mistake?

18:53.686 --> 18:55.653
I'm so sorry. I always
get the pots mixed up.

18:55.688 --> 18:57.835
Starla isn't your name, is it?

19:00.170 --> 19:01.412
Lily.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.955
How do you know that?

19:05.898 --> 19:06.947
This mark.

19:06.977 --> 19:08.204
You showed it to me a long time ago

19:08.234 --> 19:10.898
outside a crappy cub foods
in Hopkins, Minnesota.

19:15.257 --> 19:16.564
Emma?

19:16.594 --> 19:19.335
I thought you were dead.
What the hell happened to you?

19:19.680 --> 19:22.530
I... got into trouble, uh...

19:22.564 --> 19:24.820
with some bad people a couple years ago,

19:24.850 --> 19:25.875
and I needed a fresh start.

19:25.905 --> 19:28.898
But I've been careful. How did you find me?

19:29.301 --> 19:30.625
Fate.

19:30.655 --> 19:31.610
What?

19:31.640 --> 19:32.895
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

19:32.925 --> 19:34.258
but remember when we were kids,

19:34.293 --> 19:35.927
you used to say you and I were connected?

19:35.957 --> 19:39.434
Like something was drawing us together?

19:39.464 --> 19:41.065
Yeah, that's something teenage girls say,

19:41.099 --> 19:42.888
and then you braid each
other's hair and become BFFs.

19:42.918 --> 19:44.419
What if you were right?

19:44.803 --> 19:46.942
What if... there's a reason

19:46.972 --> 19:49.676
your life has been on a
downswing ever since we met?

19:49.907 --> 19:51.780
That all your problems are not your fault,

19:51.810 --> 19:53.511
they're...

19:53.545 --> 19:54.645
mine?

19:55.419 --> 19:56.681
You're right... that sounds crazy.

19:56.715 --> 19:59.016
It's complicated, but I can
explain it if you come with me.

19:59.051 --> 20:00.156
I just need you to trust me.

20:00.186 --> 20:02.825
Look, I don't know what kind
of 12-step program you're in,

20:02.855 --> 20:05.022
but I've moved on.

20:05.207 --> 20:06.195
I'm fine.

20:06.225 --> 20:07.792
You're living in the middle of nowhere

20:07.826 --> 20:08.747
under an assumed name.

20:08.777 --> 20:09.932
I can help you.

20:09.962 --> 20:11.396
I don't need your help.

20:11.715 --> 20:14.165
And my life is great, thank you very much.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.468
I have an awesome daughter
and a loving husband.

20:17.826 --> 20:19.470
The last thing I need is for you
to come into my life

20:19.505 --> 20:21.443
- and just blow it apart again, so...
- (Brakes squeal)

20:21.473 --> 20:24.515
If you'll excuse me,
that's my daughter's bus.

20:25.245 --> 20:28.112
I-I'm sorry... for... everything.

20:28.296 --> 20:29.931
You don't need to apologize.

20:29.961 --> 20:31.199
We were kids.

20:31.583 --> 20:35.324
To be honest, I haven't even
thought about you in years.

20:37.155 --> 20:38.293
Yeah?

20:38.323 --> 20:39.309
Yeah.

20:43.805 --> 20:45.983
- Hey, sweetie!
- Tire's being fixed.

20:47.833 --> 20:50.172
So it was her.

20:50.858 --> 20:51.990
Well, Emma, looks like

20:52.020 --> 20:54.388
you didn't ruin her life after all.

20:54.422 --> 20:56.355
You know me from the diner, right?

20:57.457 --> 21:00.160
Free burgers for a week
if you smile, take my hand,

21:00.195 --> 21:01.890
and walk around the block with me.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.016
But you have to decide now.

21:31.220 --> 21:33.609
- Maleficent?
- Go... now.

21:33.639 --> 21:35.139
I don't want to see either one of you.

21:35.174 --> 21:38.238
Just hear us out... please.

21:38.516 --> 21:40.806
We realized we've been so concerned

21:40.836 --> 21:44.182
about earning Emma's forgiveness that...

21:44.239 --> 21:46.678
We forgot the person we hurt most.

21:46.708 --> 21:49.053
So you're here to apologize.

21:49.432 --> 21:54.063
I'm afraid I'm not the one whose
forgiveness you really need.

21:55.316 --> 21:56.759
Your daughter.

21:56.789 --> 21:58.228
She was an innocent.

21:58.258 --> 22:00.897
It's her you need to apologize to.

22:00.927 --> 22:02.401
We will.

22:02.646 --> 22:05.129
We will do everything we
can to make it up to her.

22:05.159 --> 22:06.292
Whatever it takes.

22:06.322 --> 22:08.189
Do you think that'll be enough?

22:09.558 --> 22:11.363
Well, you've been so worried

22:11.393 --> 22:14.110
that the Dark One might
turn Emma into a monster,

22:14.140 --> 22:15.485
you forgot...

22:15.515 --> 22:18.099
that's exactly what you did to my Lilith.

22:21.464 --> 22:25.139
So, if I won't forgive you, why would she?

22:29.337 --> 22:30.410
Emma, what are you doing?

22:30.445 --> 22:33.387
I just swiped Starla's time card.
It has her real address.

22:33.417 --> 22:34.882
But she said she didn't want our help.

22:34.912 --> 22:36.127
And she was lying.

22:36.157 --> 22:38.610
- You saw her with her child.
- A child. You know me.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.566
I know when someone's lying,
and she was. She always has.

22:40.596 --> 22:42.566
Why would she be any different now?

22:42.596 --> 22:44.346
Something's wrong. We have to go find her.

22:44.376 --> 22:47.620
I'm gonna help her this time.
I'm gonna get her back to her mom.

22:49.152 --> 22:50.416
(Door bangs)

22:50.771 --> 22:52.838
(Siren wailing in distance)

23:18.465 --> 23:20.287
(Door creaks)

23:26.885 --> 23:28.402
Lily?

23:31.950 --> 23:33.550
Lily?

23:37.595 --> 23:38.695
Lily?

23:38.730 --> 23:40.001
(Switch clicks)

23:40.031 --> 23:42.604
Emma? Where have you been?

23:42.634 --> 23:47.526
I just... was in the garage,
looking for a lantern.

23:47.556 --> 23:48.571
Where's Lily?

23:48.601 --> 23:50.795
We were hoping you could tell us that.

23:50.825 --> 23:54.225
She broke into my desk, and
she stole our vacation money.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.087
That's why she sent me for this...

23:59.117 --> 24:01.101
to get me out of the house.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.057
I had no idea. I swear.

24:03.087 --> 24:04.988
We called your social
worker, and she told us

24:05.023 --> 24:07.967
that you and Lily were
never in the same group home.

24:07.997 --> 24:10.382
She said that you know each other
because you were both...

24:10.412 --> 24:12.377
- caught for stealing.
- I can explain.

24:12.407 --> 24:15.203
We also called the police once we
realized that the money was missing.

24:15.233 --> 24:16.376
You know what they said?

24:16.406 --> 24:18.880
Lily is a suspect in a robbery.

24:18.910 --> 24:22.829
I know. And that's why I
told her she had to leave.

24:23.540 --> 24:25.141
You knew?

24:25.510 --> 24:27.821
You brought a criminal into our home?

24:27.851 --> 24:30.843
You endanger our children?

24:31.588 --> 24:33.516
"Our" children?

24:33.550 --> 24:35.251
Emma, he didn't mean it like that.

24:35.286 --> 24:38.425
No, I think he meant it exactly like that.

24:39.257 --> 24:40.580
Emma!

24:40.668 --> 24:42.779
Wait! Wait!

24:49.833 --> 24:51.608
No kid's stuff.

24:51.963 --> 24:54.108
- No sign of a husband.
- (Door closes)

24:54.138 --> 24:57.311
Okay. Well, if you want me
to admit you were right...

24:57.341 --> 24:58.868
Well, you were right.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.064
Can't blame her for running off.

25:00.094 --> 25:01.944
I was about to tell her she
was Maleficent's daughter.

25:01.974 --> 25:03.557
Yeah, that might have
been tough to swallow.

25:03.587 --> 25:05.215
Yeah, well, you know how long
it took for me to believe,

25:05.249 --> 25:08.949
and that was in Storybrooke.
For her, it's not gonna be simple.

25:10.221 --> 25:11.932
- Emma.
- What?

25:14.675 --> 25:16.898
It might be simpler than you think.

25:19.330 --> 25:20.530
Son of a...

25:20.947 --> 25:23.627
She knew. She already knew.

25:23.938 --> 25:26.287
And she was looking for you.

25:28.449 --> 25:30.916
No. My parents.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.154
She knew everything. She wants revenge.

25:35.184 --> 25:36.695
(Engine turns over)

25:37.314 --> 25:38.819
Really?!

25:40.206 --> 25:41.329
Lily!

25:41.359 --> 25:43.107
(Tires screech)

25:45.686 --> 25:46.722
(Regina): Emma!

25:46.752 --> 25:50.458
The apprentice's scroll...
it was in my bag in the car!

25:50.488 --> 25:53.529
She wanted a way into
Storybrooke. Now she's got one.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.963
What are you doing?

25:56.639 --> 25:58.249
That girl destroyed my
life with one family.

25:58.279 --> 26:00.101
I'm not letting her do it again.

26:01.205 --> 26:03.373
(Engine revs, tires squeal)

26:14.440 --> 26:16.762
Looking for your wife's heart?

26:16.792 --> 26:19.259
Why don't you come inside and get it?

26:25.657 --> 26:27.569
I'm smarter than that, dearie.

26:27.603 --> 26:29.521
Our work together is done.

26:29.551 --> 26:32.274
Regina and Emma are tracking
my daughter as we speak.

26:32.308 --> 26:33.680
Soon, I'll have her back.

26:33.710 --> 26:37.044
And the savior will be just fine.

26:37.074 --> 26:38.410
Really?

26:38.788 --> 26:41.688
Now, did you ever think that your Lilith

26:41.718 --> 26:46.384
might be the one who keeps
Ms. Swan on her dark path?

26:46.429 --> 26:50.107
That two people tied by fate and history

26:50.137 --> 26:53.880
might just have a way of...
entangling themselves?

26:54.302 --> 26:56.208
You can try to scare me all you want.

26:56.238 --> 26:58.198
I won't return your wife's heart.

26:58.228 --> 26:59.772
(Chuckles) No, no, dearie.

26:59.802 --> 27:01.944
You misunderstood.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.855
I already have it.

27:03.889 --> 27:05.533
(Window opens)

27:08.255 --> 27:12.830
Regina's protection spell
might keep me out,

27:12.865 --> 27:15.700
but it doesn't account
for the common thief.

27:18.103 --> 27:19.721
(Engine revs)

27:20.845 --> 27:22.445
(Emma): She's doing it again, Regina.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.576
Every time I let Lily in,
she rips apart my life.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.344
Now she's going after my parents.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.512
I have to stop her.

27:27.546 --> 27:28.884
You will, but you can't
go in with a head of steam.

27:28.914 --> 27:30.527
You'll end up doing something you regret.

27:30.557 --> 27:33.618
Really? Tell me, your majesty, what
are your plans for Zelena?

27:33.653 --> 27:35.202
A nice chat over tea?

27:35.232 --> 27:36.688
- That's different.
- How?

27:36.722 --> 27:39.970
If Zelena lays a hand on Robin Hood,
you'll destroy her, right?

27:40.000 --> 27:43.028
Right. So I'll do the same thing to Lily.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.095
Careful, Emma. You're
starting to sound like...

27:45.125 --> 27:46.501
Like what? A villain?

27:46.531 --> 27:47.732
This is the real world, Regina.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.275
There are no heroes and villains...
just real people with real problems.

27:50.305 --> 27:51.587
So if you're gonna try to stop me,

27:51.617 --> 27:54.438
you can find your own
way back to New York.

28:10.082 --> 28:11.460
(Lily): Emma?

28:13.559 --> 28:16.021
(Scoffs) Of course you
knew where to find me.

28:16.051 --> 28:18.730
You knew your little stunt
would get me kicked out.

28:18.764 --> 28:21.404
Just do me a favor and
stay the hell away from me.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.534
Is that how you say "thank you"?

28:23.564 --> 28:24.606
For what?

28:24.636 --> 28:27.038
Ruining my chance to be
a part of that family?

28:27.072 --> 28:29.578
For setting you free, chore wheel.

28:29.637 --> 28:33.232
With this cash, we can go anywhere
and do whatever we want.

28:33.262 --> 28:35.573
I wanted to stay there.

28:35.603 --> 28:37.597
They cared about me, Lily.

28:37.627 --> 28:40.623
The moment they found out the
truth about you, they turned on you.

28:40.653 --> 28:44.245
- They were frauds.
- You're the fraud, Lily.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.184
You play the orphan card,

28:46.214 --> 28:49.670
but you have no idea
what it's really like.

28:49.700 --> 28:52.146
You think it's fun
pretending to be a runaway.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.241
This is my life!

28:55.300 --> 28:57.050
Emma, it's not like that.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.692
Here. Here's your stupid necklace.

29:00.722 --> 29:03.862
Now just go back to your lake
house and your credit cards

29:03.892 --> 29:06.753
and your... family...

29:07.746 --> 29:09.746
And leave me alone.

29:10.933 --> 29:13.660
I can't go home. They kicked me out.

29:13.690 --> 29:15.002
Right.

29:15.364 --> 29:17.617
Emma, it's true.

29:17.795 --> 29:20.641
I don't know how to explain it, but...

29:20.675 --> 29:24.561
Ever since you left,
everything has gotten worse.

29:24.591 --> 29:27.185
My life, no matter what
I do, is just wrong.

29:27.215 --> 29:29.087
And that's my fault?

29:29.117 --> 29:30.918
Maybe try making better choices.

29:30.952 --> 29:32.352
I do.

29:32.387 --> 29:33.542
I swear.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.877
But every time I try, it
just blows up in my face.

29:35.907 --> 29:37.773
It's like I'm cursed or something.

29:37.803 --> 29:39.648
- That's stupid.
- It's true.

29:39.678 --> 29:43.881
It's like my whole life is darkness, and...

29:44.016 --> 29:46.883
When you're around, things are brighter.

29:51.757 --> 29:54.471
Emma, please don't walk away again.

29:54.871 --> 29:56.990
I'm begging you.

29:57.428 --> 29:59.801
Please help me.

30:00.421 --> 30:02.504
I'm done helping you, Lily.

30:02.817 --> 30:04.005
(Inhales deeply)

30:04.035 --> 30:06.336
I'm better off alone.

30:07.756 --> 30:09.423
(Sighs)

30:26.290 --> 30:28.235
(Engine revs)

30:30.584 --> 30:32.129
There she is.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.164
(Engine accelerates)

30:43.147 --> 30:45.058
(Tires screech)

30:53.345 --> 30:55.256
Swan, watch it!

31:07.799 --> 31:09.867
(Tires screech)

31:11.136 --> 31:12.903
(Engines shut off)

31:15.996 --> 31:18.537
Hey! Hey!

31:18.914 --> 31:20.330
You know.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.494
You know everything.

31:21.529 --> 31:22.729
Did you know when we were kids?

31:22.763 --> 31:23.973
Of course not.

31:24.003 --> 31:25.505
But now?

31:25.549 --> 31:26.866
Yeah.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.234
I learned it all.

31:28.490 --> 31:30.179
- How?
- Does it really matter?

31:30.209 --> 31:31.375
It doesn't change anything.

31:31.405 --> 31:33.273
You screwed me over
before we were even born.

31:33.307 --> 31:35.096
I had no more say in what
happened than you did.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.836
But your parents did.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.667
- And the minute I get to Storybrooke...
- You lay a hand on them, I end you!

31:39.697 --> 31:41.424
(Regina): Emma, stop!

31:41.454 --> 31:42.486
Yeah?

31:42.516 --> 31:44.589
And how are you gonna do that
without your magic, savior?

31:44.619 --> 31:46.853
(Thunder crashes)

31:48.233 --> 31:49.656
(Panting)

31:50.129 --> 31:51.913
Your parents are monsters, Emma.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.026
They banished me and
threw you in a wardrobe.

31:54.056 --> 31:55.893
And now here you are,
ready to die for them,

31:55.923 --> 31:57.467
because you're so perfect.

31:57.497 --> 31:58.702
The savior.

31:58.732 --> 32:00.754
Well, they deserve to be punished.

32:00.784 --> 32:03.136
And there's only one way
to stop me, and you know it.

32:05.961 --> 32:07.605
(Gun cocks)

32:11.133 --> 32:12.478
(Chuckles)

32:12.512 --> 32:14.651
Of course it ends this way.

32:14.681 --> 32:16.775
This just makes too much sense.

32:16.805 --> 32:18.914
I'm just trying to stop you from
doing something you'll regret.

32:18.944 --> 32:21.091
You can't.

32:21.121 --> 32:24.023
Thanks to you, I'm
hardwired for bad decisions.

32:24.631 --> 32:26.981
So come on... just
put me out of my misery.

32:27.011 --> 32:28.582
You know the truth.

32:28.612 --> 32:30.780
We both know my life
isn't worth saving.

32:30.869 --> 32:31.881
(Scoffs)

32:31.915 --> 32:35.752
And if you let me go,
I will destroy everything.

32:36.542 --> 32:38.321
It's what I do.

32:38.555 --> 32:40.857
So come on... be the hero

32:40.891 --> 32:45.042
and end this right here
before it even starts.

32:51.113 --> 32:52.201
(Scoffs)

32:52.235 --> 32:53.836
Come on, Emma.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.209
Swan.

32:56.239 --> 32:58.612
Put the gun down.

33:02.106 --> 33:04.184
If you pull that trigger,

33:04.214 --> 33:06.486
you will be the one who
ruins your life this time.

33:06.516 --> 33:09.285
And Henry's and your
parents' and everyone else's.

33:09.319 --> 33:12.492
- I have to protect them.
- Then lower the gun.

33:13.785 --> 33:16.096
Your parents need a hero, not a murderer.

33:16.126 --> 33:19.618
- I'm already a murderer.
- Cruella was an accident.

33:19.648 --> 33:23.532
But if you cross this line,
the journey back isn't easy.

33:23.567 --> 33:26.202
Trust me... I know.

33:26.770 --> 33:29.332
This is what Gold wants you to do.

33:29.362 --> 33:31.207
So don't.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.036
Emma.

33:37.464 --> 33:39.553
You're better than this.

34:18.183 --> 34:20.755
(Man): That's a lovely necklace.

34:20.786 --> 34:22.487
Thanks.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.321
Did you ever notice

34:24.356 --> 34:28.292
how it complements the
birthmark on your wrist?

34:31.518 --> 34:33.034
How did you know that?

34:33.065 --> 34:36.034
I know about a lot of things, Lilith.

34:36.068 --> 34:38.172
- (Breathing shakily)
- Don't be alarmed, child.

34:38.203 --> 34:40.170
I can see that you have many questions.

34:40.205 --> 34:43.906
Fortunately, I have many answers.

34:43.936 --> 34:45.181
Answers?

34:45.210 --> 34:46.949
About who you really are

34:46.978 --> 34:51.674
and why your life has
always felt so... wrong.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.797
And who am I?

34:54.827 --> 34:57.826
A victim of the unfortunate
vagaries of fate,

34:57.856 --> 35:02.274
for which, I'm afraid, I am
partially responsible.

35:02.304 --> 35:04.095
In fact...

35:04.346 --> 35:06.716
I shouldn't even be telling you this.

35:07.182 --> 35:08.837
You're crazy.

35:08.867 --> 35:12.007
You are not as responsible
for your own misery

35:12.037 --> 35:14.331
as you would believe.

35:17.175 --> 35:19.443
The deck has been stacked
against you, Lilith,

35:19.478 --> 35:21.545
and it's not your fault.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.419
Everything you do will be harder.

35:24.449 --> 35:26.188
And I owe it to you to let you know why.

35:26.218 --> 35:29.462
I owe you the truth.

35:30.772 --> 35:32.060
Okay, Yoda.

35:32.090 --> 35:33.962
Enough riddles.

35:34.203 --> 35:36.727
What's the truth?

35:39.631 --> 35:41.961
Let's start with the necklace.

35:42.184 --> 35:45.347
It isn't exactly a stone,

35:45.377 --> 35:48.986
but it did belong to your mother.

35:49.874 --> 35:53.270
Would you like to hear about her?

36:02.448 --> 36:05.526
Why didn't you just kill me
when you had the chance?

36:06.245 --> 36:07.757
I would have.

36:07.792 --> 36:10.011
I like to think you wouldn't have.

36:10.078 --> 36:12.396
Isn't that the whole point
of savior and anti-savior?

36:12.430 --> 36:14.796
Stop calling yourself that.

36:14.826 --> 36:17.039
(Regina sighs) Bad news from home.

36:17.069 --> 36:19.140
I just lost my leverage over Gold.

36:19.170 --> 36:21.987
We have to get to Robin Hood... now.

36:24.359 --> 36:26.078
Coming?

36:26.611 --> 36:28.212
You still want me to?

36:28.746 --> 36:31.296
Yeah. I'm not pushing you away this time.

36:37.822 --> 36:39.857
(Bells jingle)

36:40.152 --> 36:42.209
There you are.

36:42.239 --> 36:43.714
(Chuckles)

36:43.744 --> 36:46.645
I brought you dinner from Granny's.

36:47.871 --> 36:49.693
Hey. Will.

36:49.723 --> 36:51.916
Is something wrong?

36:52.876 --> 36:54.209
Um...

36:54.239 --> 36:56.943
Belle, there's something
I need to show you.

37:01.629 --> 37:03.860
- Is that...?
- Yeah.

37:03.890 --> 37:05.598
Yours.

37:06.411 --> 37:08.701
It was Regina.

37:08.731 --> 37:10.464
Why would she want my heart?

37:10.494 --> 37:13.073
To use you as a pawn against me.

37:13.107 --> 37:15.642
Okay. What are you doing here?

37:15.672 --> 37:20.785
I wanted to be certain that you
got your, uh... heart back.

37:21.516 --> 37:25.050
What... y-you two
a-are working together?

37:25.080 --> 37:28.021
We share one thing in common...

37:28.906 --> 37:31.291
we both care for you.

37:31.898 --> 37:33.314
Belle, I need to say something.

37:33.344 --> 37:35.577
- I'm not sure I want to hear it.
- Please, please.

37:35.607 --> 37:37.963
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

37:40.386 --> 37:44.767
I spent every day of our
marriage deceiving you,

37:45.100 --> 37:47.823
when I should have been
trying to make you happy.

37:47.853 --> 37:49.947
And now it's too late.

37:49.977 --> 37:52.323
My heart is nearly black.

37:52.353 --> 37:55.789
And if I continue hurting you...

37:57.179 --> 38:00.045
Then there's no hope for me.

38:04.892 --> 38:08.889
I'm gonna return this to you, Belle.

38:08.919 --> 38:12.876
But he's the one who's gonna protect it.

38:12.906 --> 38:16.354
Because I've proven unworthy.

38:17.471 --> 38:19.372
(Heart throbbing)

38:21.409 --> 38:23.143
(Gasps)

38:23.177 --> 38:25.879
(Breathing heavily)

38:27.899 --> 38:30.166
Goodbye, Belle.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.583
(Bells jingle)

38:42.938 --> 38:45.071
(Door closes)

38:53.741 --> 38:55.363
Robin?

38:57.361 --> 38:59.355
Robin, open up!

39:01.989 --> 39:04.171
- (Sighs)
- Regina?

39:04.201 --> 39:06.712
W-what are you doing here?

39:07.982 --> 39:09.943
I missed you.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.779
And I you.

39:11.809 --> 39:13.514
What's going on? W-why are you here?

39:13.544 --> 39:16.116
I can explain everything.
But first, where's Marian?

39:16.146 --> 39:19.820
- She's at the store. Why?
- Good. Then there's time.

39:19.850 --> 39:21.927
But we have to act fast.

39:21.957 --> 39:23.549
Wha...

39:24.293 --> 39:25.526
W-what's this about?

39:25.556 --> 39:28.257
Marian... we have to leave
before she gets back.

39:28.292 --> 39:30.126
She is not who she says she is.

39:30.160 --> 39:35.427
- What?
- She's... my sister... Zelena.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.167
The wicked witch?

39:37.197 --> 39:39.072
But she's dead. W-we all saw that.

39:39.102 --> 39:42.652
Somehow, she tricked us
and went back in time.

39:42.682 --> 39:44.313
Robin...

39:44.343 --> 39:50.045
She went back, and she killed Marian.

39:50.079 --> 39:53.120
She took her place to get back at me.

39:53.150 --> 39:54.732
No.

39:54.762 --> 39:56.469
This is madness.

39:56.736 --> 39:59.237
Robin, what's going on?

40:00.507 --> 40:03.647
- And what is she doing here?
- It's over, Zelena.

40:03.677 --> 40:05.900
I told him everything.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.130
What's she talking about?

40:10.160 --> 40:13.008
- And who's Zelena?
- Regina, you're scaring Marian.

40:13.038 --> 40:15.359
Good. Where's the magic?

40:15.389 --> 40:17.323
You must have brought something
to make this glamour work.

40:17.357 --> 40:18.662
Where is it, Zelena?

40:18.692 --> 40:20.793
Show me, or I will rip
you apart until I find it!

40:20.827 --> 40:22.249
Regina, that's enough!

40:22.279 --> 40:24.280
Look, I know that this
is hard... for all of us.

40:24.314 --> 40:25.815
But this is the new reality.

40:25.849 --> 40:29.011
I'm with her. I'm with Marian.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.534
Actually...

40:33.134 --> 40:35.600
Not exactly.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.430
Hello, dear husband.

40:43.171 --> 40:44.337
No.

40:44.367 --> 40:47.264
- What the hell was that?
- That was magic.

40:47.681 --> 40:52.531
(Regina): Come on, Robin. We have
to get you and Roland out of here.

40:53.292 --> 40:56.673
Robin. Get Roland and let's go.

40:57.470 --> 40:59.519
I think he still wants to stay.

40:59.549 --> 41:02.585
Robin, what are you doing?
Get your son and let's go.

41:02.619 --> 41:05.150
- I-I can't.
- Yes, you can.

41:05.180 --> 41:07.165
Just come with me.

41:07.195 --> 41:10.098
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

41:10.727 --> 41:13.169
- I can't leave her here.
- What?!

41:13.199 --> 41:15.542
Do you want to tell her?

41:17.306 --> 41:18.782
Or should I?

41:18.812 --> 41:21.035
Tell me what?

41:23.684 --> 41:25.617
Robin?

41:28.272 --> 41:30.650
She's pregnant.
