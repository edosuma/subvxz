00:11.276 --> 00:13.445
"I may not be the fastest.

00:13.478 --> 00:15.747
"I may not be the tallest
or the strongest.

00:15.781 --> 00:18.518
"I may not be the best
or the brightest.

00:18.550 --> 00:21.286
"But one thing I can do
better than anyone else,

00:21.320 --> 00:25.625
that is to be me,"
which is a poem that you wrote.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.461
Well, finally that's all
you can do, isn't it?

00:28.493 --> 00:30.396
You can do a good
job of doing that.

00:30.428 --> 00:33.632
Do a good job of being me,
being yourself.

00:34.866 --> 00:37.169
That's really all
I ask of myself.

00:38.503 --> 00:40.405
Because as I said,
I wasn't the fastest,

00:40.439 --> 00:43.375
and I wasn't the brightest,
and whatever, you know.

01:46.371 --> 01:48.875
This morning we are
remembering a beloved actor

01:48.908 --> 01:53.745
who became an enduring fixture
in pop culture, Leonard Nimoy.

01:53.778 --> 01:54.813
-Leonard Nimoy.
-Leonard Nimoy.

01:54.846 --> 01:56.681
Leonard Nimoy.

01:56.715 --> 01:58.618
-Leonard Nimoy.
-Leonard Nimoy.

01:58.650 --> 02:01.353
Leonard Nimoy has died
at the age of 83.

02:01.387 --> 02:04.790
When word came out today that
actor Leonard Nimoy had died,

02:04.822 --> 02:08.828
the President said,
"I loved Spock."

02:08.860 --> 02:14.566
I have been and always
shall be... your friend.

02:20.673 --> 02:23.643
Live long...

02:23.675 --> 02:25.744
and prosper.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.227
Listen to this.

02:41.259 --> 02:43.262
I just received an email
from Wil Wheaton.

02:43.294 --> 02:46.399
Leonard Nimoy's son is
working on a documentary

02:46.431 --> 02:48.800
that he started with his
father before he passed away.

02:48.834 --> 02:51.604
It's about Mr. Spock and
his impact on our culture.

02:51.637 --> 02:56.342
"For the Love of Spock,"
Adam Nimoy. Mark.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.742
We wanted to do
something to celebrate

02:57.776 --> 02:59.278
the 50th anniversary
of "Star Trek"

02:59.311 --> 03:01.614
which was coming up
in 2016.

03:01.646 --> 03:04.584
And a documentary about Spock had
never really been produced before.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.758
I thought it was
an interesting idea

03:12.790 --> 03:14.960
to create a film just
focused on Spock,

03:14.993 --> 03:16.795
who he is, how he came about,

03:16.829 --> 03:19.799
and why he has continued
to resonate for 50 years,

03:19.831 --> 03:22.567
all as a part
of the celebration

03:22.600 --> 03:25.237
of the anniversary
of "The Original Series."

03:25.270 --> 03:28.473
And the minute I suggested
this to Dad, he was in.

03:45.723 --> 03:50.262
Although my father had a long and
prosperous life and hadn't smoked in years,

03:50.295 --> 03:53.265
he died from chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease

03:53.299 --> 03:55.668
from over 30 years
of cigarette smoking.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.741
After Dad died,
it became clear

04:01.774 --> 04:03.675
that the film needed
to include his life

04:03.709 --> 04:05.978
as well as the
life of Mr. Spock.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.447
And that in turn led me
on a journey of discovery

04:08.479 --> 04:11.450
about my relationship
with my father.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.288
Well, I'm from
Boston originally.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.891
I've been in Los Angeles working in
films off and on for about 17 years.

04:19.925 --> 04:22.627
I started acting when I was a
little boy, about eight years old

04:22.661 --> 04:24.596
in neighborhood settlement
houses in Boston.

04:24.629 --> 04:26.298
And kind of grew up into it.

04:26.331 --> 04:27.666
I just kept doing it
because I liked it.

04:27.699 --> 04:29.634
And then suddenly just decided
that I liked it enough

04:29.668 --> 04:30.703
to want to make
a career of it.

04:30.735 --> 04:33.004
So I came
to California in 1949

04:33.038 --> 04:35.408
and started acting
in films then.

04:53.891 --> 04:57.430
Now my parents were extremely diligent,
responsible, practical people.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.332
I grew up during the Depression.

04:59.365 --> 05:00.566
When I told them at age 17

05:00.600 --> 05:03.536
that I was going to study drama
at the Pasadena Playhouse

05:03.569 --> 05:06.838
and become an actor,
they were grief stricken.

05:06.872 --> 05:10.876
They tried to dissuade me by refusing
to give me the tuition, saying,

05:10.908 --> 05:14.079
"You'll have to do it
without any help from us."

05:14.112 --> 05:18.350
They were totally against it...

05:18.384 --> 05:20.485
because they were certainly...

05:20.519 --> 05:24.389
Hoped he would work into another
profession of some kind.

05:24.423 --> 05:25.824
But he wasn't suited
for all that.

05:25.858 --> 05:27.793
He wanted to do what
he wanted to do.

05:27.826 --> 05:29.495
Being stubborn,

05:29.528 --> 05:32.098
I saved some money
by selling vacuum cleaners.

05:32.130 --> 05:35.633
I bought a train ticket,
and I headed west to California.

05:35.666 --> 05:37.135
So I'm walking down
the streets of Pasadena

05:37.168 --> 05:39.771
on a hot September day,
sweat pouring.

05:39.805 --> 05:44.677
I'm wearing a wool suit, a
hand-painted tie, and suede shoes.

05:44.709 --> 05:46.444
I must have looked like
somebody that just arrived

05:46.478 --> 05:49.449
from off the boat
from Transylvania.

05:53.584 --> 05:56.855
My mom was
an aspiring actress,

05:56.889 --> 06:01.093
and she met my dad backstage
at a theater in Hollywood.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.762
But she gave all that up
to become a housewife.

06:06.932 --> 06:09.068
My sister was born '55.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.937
My dad was in the service then.

06:12.838 --> 06:14.807
Then my parents came back
to Los Angeles,

06:14.839 --> 06:17.509
and I was born in '56.

06:20.144 --> 06:23.048
My mother told me that when my
sister Julie and I were young,

06:23.081 --> 06:26.919
my father was very involved
in helping her take care of us.

06:31.189 --> 06:34.726
# Now and then
when we fall in place #

06:34.759 --> 06:37.430
# It makes me feel all right #

06:37.463 --> 06:39.098
# Makes me feel all right #

06:39.130 --> 06:42.634
# Back and forth
we will win this race #

06:42.668 --> 06:46.504
# To find out what it's like #

06:46.538 --> 06:51.543
# In time, I'll be all right #

06:53.946 --> 07:00.553
# In time, I'll be just fine #

07:01.987 --> 07:05.758
# Now and then
when we fall in place #

07:05.790 --> 07:08.060
# It makes me feel all right #

07:08.093 --> 07:09.762
One of my favorite
memories of my dad was

07:09.795 --> 07:12.665
he hustled his ass
during the early '60s,

07:12.697 --> 07:13.632
doing all kinds of jobs.

07:13.665 --> 07:15.867
He was servicing fish tanks.

07:15.901 --> 07:17.802
He set them up in
doctors' offices.

07:17.836 --> 07:20.172
It was like sort of
a fad in the '60s,

07:20.204 --> 07:22.240
and Dad had a corner
on that market.

07:22.274 --> 07:24.076
We knew that dad sold freezers.

07:24.108 --> 07:25.710
You know, he worked
in a pet store.

07:25.744 --> 07:27.546
He drove a cab.

07:27.579 --> 07:30.249
He took care of aquariums.

07:30.281 --> 07:32.984
He had vending machines
at one point,

07:33.017 --> 07:36.187
so he had all these little
trinkets kept in boxes.

07:36.221 --> 07:39.225
He worked at Wil Wright's
Ice Cream Parlor.

07:39.257 --> 07:41.192
He was managing
an apartment building.

07:41.225 --> 07:42.560
He was not around.

07:42.593 --> 07:44.262
And even when Dad
was at home,

07:44.295 --> 07:47.065
it was all these
home improvement projects.

07:47.098 --> 07:48.933
My father was truly
a renaissance man.

07:48.966 --> 07:50.935
He could do just
about anything.

07:50.968 --> 07:55.206
Like build that massive
brick wall in our backyard.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.009
He was trying so hard
to get this career going,

07:58.043 --> 08:01.146
to make his life,
to do what he wanted to do,

08:01.178 --> 08:03.748
which was be in the
arts, be an actor.

08:03.781 --> 08:06.284
One of my idols was Lon Chaney,

08:06.317 --> 08:09.153
who was called the man of a
thousand faces in movies,

08:09.187 --> 08:11.290
because he'd change
characters so drastically

08:11.322 --> 08:13.224
from one performance
to another.

08:13.257 --> 08:15.026
And I consider myself
that kind of a person.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.961
I go to the makeup department
or the wardrobe department,

08:16.995 --> 08:19.264
and get something together
and find a character.

08:46.258 --> 08:48.894
-What you looking at?
-Nothing.

08:48.927 --> 08:50.495
-What's that for?
-For nothing.

08:50.528 --> 08:53.798
Next time you wanna look at me, line
forms to the right. Two bits admission.

08:53.831 --> 08:57.068
If they see water in the desert
where there is no water,

08:57.101 --> 08:59.203
it's their eyes that lie,
not my mouth.

08:59.236 --> 09:01.906
Just having any of those
coins in your possession

09:01.940 --> 09:04.810
is liable to lead you to a lot
more trouble than you bargain for.

09:04.842 --> 09:07.211
Have no fear from me, Marshal.

09:07.245 --> 09:09.615
No man kills the bee.

09:09.648 --> 09:11.350
He only wants to follow
him to the honey.

09:11.383 --> 09:14.954
He was a fine man. Hasn't had
a decent break in 20 years.

09:14.986 --> 09:16.187
Now he's been built
up a little bit.

09:16.221 --> 09:17.556
He's got a little dignity,
a little stature.

09:17.589 --> 09:20.192
You're not going to deny he was a
good Marine and a good officer.

09:20.225 --> 09:21.293
No, no, he was both.

09:21.326 --> 09:23.596
Then why crucify him?

09:23.629 --> 09:25.029
You don't get it,
do you, Sanders?

09:25.062 --> 09:26.999
I don't have any choice.

09:27.032 --> 09:28.968
- Hello?
-I'm not going to let you do it.

09:29.999 --> 09:30.502
It's for you, Lieutenant.

09:30.535 --> 09:33.805
I did this job in an episode
of "The Lieutenant" series.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.675
A few weeks after I finished the
job, my agent called me and said,

09:36.707 --> 09:39.211
"Gene Roddenberry
saw the footage,

09:39.244 --> 09:42.214
"was interested in you,
liked what you did,

09:42.246 --> 09:44.349
"and said that he has
in mind for you a role

09:44.383 --> 09:47.886
in a pilot that he's developing
for a science fiction series."

09:47.918 --> 09:50.221
Period.

09:50.254 --> 09:52.224
I really didn't give it
a lot of thought.

09:52.256 --> 09:55.293
You hear that kind of thing, and
you're a long way from getting a job.

09:55.326 --> 09:58.230
What about some of
the characters on the show?

09:58.263 --> 10:00.966
Did you create them with
certain actors in mind?

10:00.999 --> 10:02.701
Leonard Nimoy
was the one actor

10:02.734 --> 10:03.836
I definitely had in mind.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.704
And I thought to myself,

10:05.736 --> 10:09.341
"If I ever do this science
fiction that I want to do,

10:09.374 --> 10:10.808
"he'd make a great alien.

10:10.841 --> 10:14.078
And with those cheekbones, some sort
of a pointed ear might go well."

10:14.111 --> 10:15.947
I simply made one
phone call to Leonard,

10:15.980 --> 10:18.016
and he came in,
and that was it.

10:18.049 --> 10:22.020
So I went to this meeting
expecting to be auditioned,

10:22.053 --> 10:25.923
or to read for him,
or... whatever.

10:25.956 --> 10:29.293
He was very congenial
and said, "Let's take a walk."

10:29.326 --> 10:32.865
And he walked me over to
the scenic design department.

10:32.898 --> 10:37.069
He showed me the plans of the
sets that were being built,

10:37.101 --> 10:38.937
introduced me to
the scenic designer.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.038
Walked me over to
the prop department.

10:40.071 --> 10:43.108
Showed me some of the props
that were being made.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.409
Wardrobe department, same thing.

10:44.442 --> 10:46.010
"Here's some sketches
of the clothes."

10:46.043 --> 10:47.913
I thought,
"This is interesting.

10:47.946 --> 10:51.115
"It's like he's telling me
I'm doing this job.

10:51.149 --> 10:54.419
If I keep my mouth shut, I might
have a job here," you know?

10:54.452 --> 10:58.723
Prior to "Star Trek," I never had a
job that lasted longer than two weeks

10:58.756 --> 11:01.426
in any television show
or movie, never. Two weeks.

11:03.294 --> 11:05.329
Mr. Spock here.
We're intercepting...

11:05.363 --> 11:08.100
I didn't have a cool look
in mind at first.

11:08.133 --> 11:12.171
I had this jagged haircut
and bushy eyebrows,

11:12.203 --> 11:15.940
and we went through
a struggle with the ears.

11:15.974 --> 11:17.776
The studio had contracted
with a company

11:17.808 --> 11:19.711
to do special effects
for the show.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.714
Not film special effects,

11:21.746 --> 11:25.883
but items like
suits for creatures,

11:25.917 --> 11:28.052
creature outfits,
and that kind of thing.

11:28.086 --> 11:31.990
And included in the
contract was the ears.

11:32.023 --> 11:32.990
They were supposed
to do the ears.

11:33.024 --> 11:35.727
Now, they were very good
at creating creatures,

11:35.760 --> 11:39.163
and we used them throughout the
series, this particular company.

11:39.197 --> 11:41.265
But they were not
really specialists

11:41.298 --> 11:44.035
in the very fine, delicate
kind of appliance work

11:44.068 --> 11:46.504
that's necessary to add something
to a person's features

11:46.538 --> 11:49.307
and make it really look like
it's part of that person.

11:49.341 --> 11:52.778
We came right down within about three
or four days of shooting the series,

11:52.811 --> 11:54.812
and I said to Gene Roddenberry,

11:54.846 --> 11:58.049
"This is not going to work, and maybe
we'd just better forget about the ears."

11:58.082 --> 12:01.052
Well, he insisted he wanted the
ears to be part of the character.

12:01.086 --> 12:04.322
And he said, "You try it, and let's
work it out. Let's solve the problem.

12:04.355 --> 12:06.958
"And at the end of 13 shows if
you're not satisfied with the ears,

12:06.991 --> 12:09.961
I'll write a script
where Spock gets an ear job."

12:09.995 --> 12:12.431
So we went ahead
and worked on the problem,

12:12.464 --> 12:14.833
and Fred Phillips, who was
the actual makeup man

12:14.865 --> 12:17.302
who was going to do my makeup
each day on the series,

12:17.335 --> 12:19.104
knew what the problem was.

12:19.136 --> 12:20.805
And a couple of days
before we started shooting,

12:20.839 --> 12:22.941
he called in
an appliance specialist,

12:22.974 --> 12:24.943
and we very quickly went to him.

12:24.975 --> 12:26.443
Got the ears done
in about 24 hours.

12:26.477 --> 12:30.348
And they were ready, and they were
perfect, and that solved the problem.

12:30.381 --> 12:31.949
Freddie Phillips always said

12:31.982 --> 12:34.952
that Leonard Nimoy
reported for work at 6:30 a.m.,

12:34.985 --> 12:39.825
and Mr. Spock could always be counted
on to arrive somewhere around 7:15.

13:05.417 --> 13:08.854
Definitely something out there,
Captain, headed this way.

13:08.886 --> 13:11.088
Our tests indicate
the planet's surface

13:11.121 --> 13:13.825
without considerably more
vegetation or some animals,

13:13.859 --> 13:15.894
simply too barren
to support life.

13:15.927 --> 13:17.896
The first time,
it did not sell.

13:17.928 --> 13:19.865
But, NBC...

13:19.898 --> 13:22.835
NBC thought it was too "cerebral"
was the term they used.

13:22.868 --> 13:27.039
The network found the first pilot
too "cerebral," they said.

13:27.072 --> 13:29.908
Not a straight
lined story enough.

13:29.941 --> 13:34.278
And unusual in that they
decided to try a second pilot.

13:34.312 --> 13:36.615
NBC told Gene to fire

13:36.648 --> 13:39.484
almost the entire cast,
including me.

13:39.517 --> 13:43.922
Well, Gene felt very strongly that the bulk
of the character that I was to portray,

13:43.955 --> 13:45.958
that every time I was on screen

13:45.990 --> 13:48.526
you'd be reminded
that we have a mixed crew.

13:48.559 --> 13:50.628
So he stuck to his guns
fortunately for me.

13:50.662 --> 13:53.165
The original pilot even
had a different captain,

13:53.197 --> 13:55.167
Jeff Hunter.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.403
The only actor
that stayed over

13:58.436 --> 13:59.905
was Leonard Nimoy.

14:07.245 --> 14:08.480
And then, I had a shock.

14:08.513 --> 14:11.383
I opened up my mail, and here
was a, here was a pamphlet

14:11.416 --> 14:15.287
from the NBC Sales
and Promotion Department.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.489
And it was a pamphlet
about "Star Trek,"

14:17.522 --> 14:19.157
this new series that was
going to be on the air

14:19.190 --> 14:20.425
coming in the fall,

14:20.457 --> 14:23.928
I saw this photograph
of myself as Spock,

14:23.961 --> 14:24.996
and it didn't look right.

14:25.029 --> 14:28.466
Something struck me as strange.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.501
And the closer I looked,
the more I realized that

14:30.534 --> 14:33.105
they had straightened out my
eyebrows, made them look normal,

14:33.138 --> 14:35.374
and they had taken off
the tips off the ears.

14:36.341 --> 14:38.476
The network said,

14:38.509 --> 14:42.114
"We are very dependent on
the numbers in the Bible Belt,

14:42.147 --> 14:44.216
"and they will not accept
in their homes a character

14:44.249 --> 14:45.984
who looks devilish
with these pointed ears."

14:46.017 --> 14:49.321
Are you casting me
in the role of Satan?

14:49.354 --> 14:50.288
Not at all, Captain.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.524
Is there anyone on this ship

14:52.557 --> 14:57.028
who even remotely...
looks like Satan?

14:59.998 --> 15:03.568
I am not aware of anyone who
fits that description, Captain.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.571
No, Mr. Spock,
I didn't think you were.

15:10.674 --> 15:12.610
Dr. Dehner feels
he isn't that dangerous.

15:12.644 --> 15:14.546
What makes you right, and a
trained psychiatrist wrong?

15:14.578 --> 15:17.315
Because she feels. I don't.

15:17.349 --> 15:18.917
All I know is logic.

15:18.951 --> 15:22.586
In my opinion, we'd be lucky if we can
repair this ship and get away in time.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.423
One of the reasons for the shift

15:24.456 --> 15:26.325
in the Spock character
when you came on-board

15:26.357 --> 15:28.159
was because when I was working
with Jeffrey Hunter...

15:28.192 --> 15:30.294
Jeffrey Hunter was
a very internalized actor.

15:30.327 --> 15:32.396
Very fine actor.
This was his style of work.

15:32.429 --> 15:35.066
There's an old joke about two
actors preparing to play a scene.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.336
And one says to the other, "What are
you going to play in this scene?"

15:37.369 --> 15:38.971
And the one says,
"I'm playing nothing."

15:39.004 --> 15:40.504
The other one says,
"No, no, no,

15:40.538 --> 15:41.972
you can't play nothing.
I'm playing nothing."

15:42.005 --> 15:45.711
So here's Jeffrey Hunter playing this
quiet, internalized performance,

15:47.379 --> 15:50.282
And I felt the need to help drive
something in opposition to it.

15:50.315 --> 15:51.817
Right, right.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.152
- Otherwise, we're both playing nothing.
- -Right.

15:54.184 --> 15:56.220
And when you came on-board
with your energy,

15:56.254 --> 15:58.322
and a sense of humor,
and a twinkle in the eye,

15:58.355 --> 16:02.126
I was able to then become
the cooler Spock.

16:02.159 --> 16:06.430
Has it occurred to you that
there's a certain... inefficiency

16:06.464 --> 16:10.235
in constantly questioning me on things
you've already made up your mind about?

16:10.268 --> 16:13.071
It gives me emotional security.

16:13.104 --> 16:20.045
Leonard bouncing off of me could
now dramatically be internal

16:20.077 --> 16:21.480
allowing me to be external,

16:21.513 --> 16:26.785
and the two forces made
an interesting combination.

16:26.817 --> 16:30.355
I prefer the concrete,
the graspable, the provable.

16:30.388 --> 16:33.759
You'd make a splendid computer,
Mr. Spock.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.360
That is very kind
of you, Captain.

16:36.394 --> 16:37.796
You know, I don't know
if I had played Kirk

16:37.828 --> 16:41.632
that it would have dawned on me to
have a sense of humor with Spock.

16:41.666 --> 16:43.001
I don't know that I would
have thought of that,

16:43.033 --> 16:47.806
but Shatner's take on it was,
"I can fuck with Spock."

16:47.839 --> 16:49.508
I mean, you know...

16:49.541 --> 16:51.510
Without being offensive
to the character.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.644
"I can play with him."

16:56.548 --> 16:59.451
Certain you don't know
what irritation is?

16:59.484 --> 17:02.187
The fact one of my ancestors
married a human female...

17:02.220 --> 17:05.390
Terrible having
bad blood like that.

17:05.423 --> 17:09.193
Those two characters
are the yin and yang.

17:09.227 --> 17:11.630
They are that in front
of the camera,

17:11.663 --> 17:14.500
and it works beautifully,
magnificently.

17:17.335 --> 17:20.071
There must be some intelligent
form of life on Thasus.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.106
He could not possibly
have survived alone.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.608
The ship's food concentrates would
have been exhausted in a year or so.

17:24.642 --> 17:27.144
By which time he would have been
eating fruits, vegetables, and nuts.

17:27.178 --> 17:29.181
Probes of Thasus indicate
very little edible plant life.

17:29.213 --> 17:30.682
And probes have been
known to be wrong.

17:30.714 --> 17:34.485
Doctor, are you speaking
scientifically or emotionally?

17:34.519 --> 17:38.856
I thought the character
McCoy played by D. Kelley

17:38.890 --> 17:42.326
made that, as the fans
call it, the triumvirate,

17:42.359 --> 17:46.263
because he was
the common man.

17:46.297 --> 17:47.865
Certainly a brilliant doctor,

17:47.898 --> 17:52.536
but he had all of the
irritations, frustrations,

17:52.569 --> 17:55.506
the reactions that
most people would have.

17:55.539 --> 17:58.576
I for one could use a good
non-reconstituted meal.

17:58.609 --> 18:00.811
Doctor, you are a sensualist.

18:00.845 --> 18:03.148
You bet your pointed ears I am.

18:03.181 --> 18:05.217
It's actually an interesting
sort of triumvirate

18:05.250 --> 18:08.153
between Spock, Bones, and Kirk.

18:08.185 --> 18:11.188
And for Kirk, Spock is his...

18:11.221 --> 18:13.825
You know, they're like the devil and
the angel on his shoulder, really.

18:13.857 --> 18:17.729
Spock is his intelligence,
and his logic, and his sense,

18:17.761 --> 18:20.499
and you know, McCoy is more his
sort of slightly more emotional,

18:20.531 --> 18:23.335
slightly more, you know,
knee-jerk kind of side.

18:23.367 --> 18:28.373
The banter between McCoy
and Spock was, you know,

18:28.405 --> 18:34.346
often some of the most
fun elements in the show

18:34.378 --> 18:35.679
and indeed in the movies.

18:35.712 --> 18:37.848
What's the matter, Spock?

18:37.882 --> 18:40.285
There's something disquieting
about these creatures.

18:40.317 --> 18:42.220
I don't know too much about
these little Tribbles yet,

18:42.252 --> 18:43.821
but there is one thing
that I have discovered.

18:43.855 --> 18:45.589
What is that, doctor?

18:45.623 --> 18:48.460
I like them
better than I like you.

18:48.492 --> 18:52.364
Doctor, they do indeed have
one redeeming characteristic.

18:52.396 --> 18:54.165
What's that?

18:54.199 --> 18:56.468
They do not talk too much.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.637
When you have the kind of
cynical wit of McCoy,

18:59.671 --> 19:03.341
and you have the swagger
and braggadocio of Kirk,

19:03.374 --> 19:06.745
and then you have the intellect
and cold reason of Spock,

19:06.778 --> 19:10.582
he's like the perfect human
being all wrapped up in one.

19:16.621 --> 19:21.727
The following program is brought
to you in living color on NBC.

19:27.298 --> 19:28.767
That first night
of the premiere

19:28.799 --> 19:30.402
we had to actually go
to some friends' house,

19:30.434 --> 19:33.837
because they had a color TV,
a big console color TV.

19:33.871 --> 19:34.906
We did not.

19:34.939 --> 19:37.542
We had a big console
black and white.

19:37.575 --> 19:40.412
Why don't you tell me
I'm an attractive young lady

19:40.444 --> 19:43.548
or ask me if I've
ever been in love?

19:43.580 --> 19:48.719
Tell me how your planet Vulcan looks on
a lazy evening when the moon is full.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.557
Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura.

19:53.590 --> 19:57.294
I'm not surprised, Mr. Spock.

19:57.327 --> 20:00.798
Dad in his costume,
Vulcan costume,

20:00.832 --> 20:03.335
it was like,
"This is really cool."

20:03.367 --> 20:06.770
I remember it was just such
an exciting night for us.

20:06.804 --> 20:08.540
This is not Nancy.

20:08.573 --> 20:10.809
If she were Nancy,
could she take this?

20:10.842 --> 20:13.812
Stop it! Stop it, Spock!

20:13.845 --> 20:15.247
Stop it!

20:18.548 --> 20:19.518
Do you read?

20:20.550 --> 20:22.587
Frequency open, Mr. Spock.

20:23.654 --> 20:25.423
Spock here, Captain.

20:33.364 --> 20:35.667
Hi, Daddy.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.302
When I came
to visit the set...

20:37.335 --> 20:38.603
They started shooting
that first season

20:38.635 --> 20:41.639
at the end of May
and early June in 1966.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.508
I was nine,
almost 10 years old,

20:43.540 --> 20:45.809
and I was off
for summer vacation.

20:45.843 --> 20:48.513
And this is why Dad would
take me to work with him.

20:48.546 --> 20:49.814
I would get up early
in the morning,

20:49.847 --> 20:52.683
and we would drive to Desilu
right next to the Paramount lot,

20:52.717 --> 20:56.388
and I'd be there all day.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.890
So I went out to California, and
of course, Leonard took care of...

20:58.923 --> 21:01.526
I stayed at Leonard's home.

21:01.558 --> 21:05.497
And he said, "Guess what.
I've got this new show."

21:05.529 --> 21:06.998
This is 1966.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.866
I said, "What is it?" He said,
"It's called 'Star Trek.'"

21:08.900 --> 21:11.569
He said, "You've gotta come on
the set." I said, "Of course."

21:11.602 --> 21:13.371
You know, I'm in the theater,

21:13.403 --> 21:15.673
and this is my first
time in Hollywood.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.643
And I'm out there,
and I walk on the set,

21:18.675 --> 21:19.977
and I see Leonard.

21:21.045 --> 21:24.582
He came out
from the dressing room,

21:24.615 --> 21:26.384
and I see this hair.

21:26.416 --> 21:29.320
I see these eyebrows
up to here.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.956
And I see these ears on him,

21:31.989 --> 21:35.093
and I said,
"Jeez, what is this?"

21:35.125 --> 21:38.863
And he did a scene, and he
was terrific in the scene.

21:38.895 --> 21:41.665
But I said... I got him to the
side. I couldn't believe it.

21:41.699 --> 21:45.804
I said, "Leonard, Leonard, come
here. I've got talk to you."

21:45.836 --> 21:50.407
I said, "No matter what you do, you've got to
get out of this as soon as you possibly can.

21:50.441 --> 21:52.977
This is a treadmill
to oblivion."

21:53.009 --> 21:57.414
The review that
"Variety" gave us

21:57.448 --> 21:59.918
when we first went on the air
in September of 1966.

22:01.519 --> 22:06.524
And I thought you'd enjoy hearing what
our show business Bible said about us

22:06.557 --> 22:08.360
the first week
we went on the air.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.795
This is dated September...

22:09.827 --> 22:14.632
It appeared on September 14th, 1966,
just a little over 25 years ago.

22:14.664 --> 22:17.701
It said, "'Star Trek' with William
Shatner, Leonard Nomoid... "

22:21.071 --> 22:22.940
"'Star Trek' won't work."

22:26.778 --> 22:29.146
That's the opening line.

22:29.180 --> 22:34.052
Then it says, "An incredible
and dreary mess of confusion...

22:34.085 --> 22:36.121
"trudged on for a long hour..."

22:37.556 --> 22:41.759
"...with hardly any relief from
violence, killings, hypnotic stuff,

22:41.792 --> 22:44.161
and a distasteful,
ugly monster."

22:46.663 --> 22:50.701
"William Shatner... " Shush!

22:50.734 --> 22:54.038
"William Shatner
appears wooden," it says.

22:59.743 --> 23:03.514
I didn't say it.
It says it here, right?

23:03.548 --> 23:05.482
I never heard him
accused of being,

23:05.516 --> 23:07.719
accused of being wooden
before, you know.

23:10.454 --> 23:11.822
"Spock!"

23:15.926 --> 23:18.829
"Scotty!"

23:18.863 --> 23:21.799
"I need warp speed in four
minutes, or we're all dead!"

23:23.701 --> 23:26.805
Then it says, "The same
goes for Leonard Nimoy."

23:30.575 --> 23:35.646
There are 500 or 1,000 who could
play our characters effectively.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.216
There's only one person
who could play Mr. Spock.

23:38.249 --> 23:45.088
Spock called for exactly the kind
of work I was prepared to do.

23:45.122 --> 23:48.660
He was a character with a rich
and dynamic inner life,

23:48.692 --> 23:50.728
half human, half Vulcan.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.597
He was the embodiment
of the outsider,

23:53.631 --> 23:57.669
like the immigrants who surrounded
me in Boston in my early years.

23:57.701 --> 23:59.170
How do you find your way

23:59.202 --> 24:02.206
as the alien
in a foreign culture?

24:02.240 --> 24:05.943
Keep your Vulcan hands off me.

24:05.977 --> 24:08.079
Just keep away.

24:08.112 --> 24:12.650
Your feelings might be hurt,
you green-blooded half breed.

24:12.682 --> 24:17.055
May I say that I have not thoroughly
enjoyed serving with humans.

24:17.087 --> 24:21.125
I find their illogic and foolish
emotions a constant irritant.

24:21.157 --> 24:24.795
Then transfer out, freak.

24:24.828 --> 24:26.897
Most everyone,
and there are exceptions,

24:26.931 --> 24:30.835
but most everyone feels
a little bit like an outsider.

24:30.867 --> 24:32.803
I would argue the most
interesting people seem to.

24:32.836 --> 24:36.673
So, there's something
wonderfully comforting

24:36.707 --> 24:41.145
and relatable to know that
Spock felt that way himself.

24:41.178 --> 24:45.950
I grew up as a skinny,
nerdy, gay kid in the south,

24:45.982 --> 24:47.885
you know, in the 70's.

24:47.919 --> 24:49.888
Not exactly
a comfortable existence.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.657
There's a lot of
internal conflict.

24:52.690 --> 24:55.559
So the character of Spock
from the very beginning...

24:55.593 --> 24:57.729
And you know, when I was
five, I didn't know why,

24:57.761 --> 24:58.829
or seven, I didn't know why,

24:58.863 --> 25:00.865
but I was captivated

25:00.897 --> 25:04.903
by this character that was
based on internal conflict.

25:04.935 --> 25:10.607
Spock, I think people
recognize themselves in him.

25:10.641 --> 25:14.946
He is, an outsider.

25:14.979 --> 25:16.548
He is the alien.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.649
I think everyone feels
like an outsider sometimes.

25:18.682 --> 25:21.051
And since he's
a nonhuman outsider,

25:21.085 --> 25:25.088
it's an otherness that everybody
can relate to in their own way.

25:25.122 --> 25:29.160
People sometimes think
they don't belong in a group.

25:29.192 --> 25:32.596
And really that's what
I've found, you know...

25:32.630 --> 25:36.668
I was very tall from
when I was young,

25:36.701 --> 25:39.770
and I felt apart
from other people.

25:39.804 --> 25:43.108
And I really associated
with that character.

25:47.845 --> 25:49.646
I think it
was the very first episode

25:49.680 --> 25:52.650
we were filming after the pilot
when we started into production.

25:52.682 --> 25:55.752
There was a scene in which
the ship was being threatened

25:55.786 --> 25:59.190
by some outside problems,
outside dangerous force,

25:59.222 --> 26:00.791
and there was a lot
of activity on the ship.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.326
The captain was saying,
"Do such and such.

26:02.359 --> 26:06.597
Press this button. Do this. Warp three.
Get us out of here," and so forth.

26:06.631 --> 26:10.802
And Spock had one word to say,
and the word was, "Fascinating."

26:10.835 --> 26:12.769
And we're looking at this thing
on the screen, you know,

26:12.803 --> 26:14.806
and everyone else is reacting,
"Look at it. Blah, blah."

26:14.838 --> 26:16.139
And I got caught up
in that energy,

26:16.173 --> 26:18.710
and I said, "Fascinating."

26:18.742 --> 26:21.878
And the director gave me
a brilliant note, and he said,

26:21.912 --> 26:25.616
"Be different. Be the scientist.
Be detached.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.787
See it as something that's a
curiosity rather than a threat."

26:30.788 --> 26:31.789
Fascinating.

26:34.392 --> 26:39.163
Well... a big chunk of the
character was born right there.

26:39.195 --> 26:42.966
If I seem insensitive to what
you're going through, Captain,

26:43.000 --> 26:47.372
understand... it's the way I am.

26:47.404 --> 26:50.974
A lesser actor would say, "Why would I want
to play him? He doesn't have any emotions."

26:51.008 --> 26:52.744
But he has so many emotions.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.912
But he also has
emotional control.

26:54.944 --> 26:56.780
Expresses very little
of what he's feeling,

26:56.814 --> 27:00.084
and I think it's fun
for the audience to watch

27:00.116 --> 27:03.354
to see if there's a glimmer
of something that pops through.

27:03.386 --> 27:05.255
I had a very interesting
conversation

27:05.288 --> 27:08.291
with your father about Spock,

27:08.325 --> 27:12.363
because we were talking about
him as a cold, unemotional guy.

27:12.395 --> 27:14.898
And Leonard said, "I never
played him that way.

27:14.932 --> 27:19.002
I always played him as a guy trying
to keep his emotions in check."

27:19.036 --> 27:23.941
And I thought that was a subtle
and ingenious choice,

27:23.973 --> 27:28.211
because it lent a dynamic tension
to what you saw on the screen,

27:28.244 --> 27:30.013
particularly in the closeups,

27:30.047 --> 27:31.449
of a guy trying
to keep a lid on it.

27:31.481 --> 27:32.950
That thing must be destroyed.

27:32.982 --> 27:35.919
You tried to destroy it
once before, Commodore.

27:35.952 --> 27:38.955
The result was a wrecked
ship and a dead crew.

27:38.989 --> 27:43.193
I am officially notifying you
that I am exercising my option

27:43.227 --> 27:46.297
under regulations
as a Star Fleet Commodore,

27:46.329 --> 27:48.699
and that I am assuming
command of the Enterprise.

27:54.838 --> 27:57.075
You can't let him
do this, Spock.

27:57.107 --> 27:58.975
Doctor, you are out of line.

27:59.009 --> 28:01.980
So are you... sir.

28:02.846 --> 28:04.281
Well, Spock?

28:04.315 --> 28:08.452
Unfortunately, Star Fleet Order 104,
Section B leaves me no alternative.

28:08.486 --> 28:10.755
Mr. Spock, I order you
to assume command

28:10.788 --> 28:13.057
on my personal authority
as captain of the Enterprise.

28:13.089 --> 28:17.728
Commodore Decker,
you are relieved of command.

28:17.761 --> 28:21.832
I don't recognize your
authority to relieve me.

28:23.400 --> 28:27.238
Commodore, I do not wish
to place you under arrest.

28:29.173 --> 28:30.775
You're bluffing.

28:30.807 --> 28:33.044
Vulcans never bluff.

28:33.076 --> 28:36.480
I talked about it at the time
being heavily influenced

28:36.513 --> 28:39.382
by what I saw Harry Belafonte
do on stage one night.

28:39.415 --> 28:41.384
He came out on stage,
and a spotlight came up on him,

28:41.417 --> 28:44.321
and he was there. He just
stood there very quietly.

28:44.355 --> 28:46.923
Applause. Next song,
stood there quietly and sang.

28:46.957 --> 28:49.093
Now he must have been
on stage 10 or 15 minutes.

28:49.125 --> 28:51.796
He was just standing there
with his hands on his thighs,

28:51.828 --> 28:53.798
and sang,
and when he made a gesture,

28:53.830 --> 28:55.532
it was like
the whole place shook.

28:55.566 --> 28:58.469
It was like, "" You know?

28:58.501 --> 29:00.171
It was gigantic.

29:00.203 --> 29:01.938
What a lesson.

29:01.971 --> 29:06.978
If you are minimal,
then that becomes a big deal.

29:07.010 --> 29:10.181
If you are minimal,
that becomes a big deal.

29:15.819 --> 29:17.487
He's gone.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.423
You make a comment
with an eyebrow,

29:19.455 --> 29:22.993
that's just as powerful
as throwing punches.

29:23.027 --> 29:25.863
He didn't wield the human side
frivolously for effect.

29:25.895 --> 29:28.298
Most of the time,
it would be contained,

29:28.332 --> 29:29.934
but occasionally,

29:29.967 --> 29:33.403
you know, most notably
at the end of 'Amok Time,'

29:33.436 --> 29:36.406
when he realizes that
he didn't kill Kirk,

29:36.440 --> 29:38.409
there's a sweet moment
of like, "Jim!"

29:38.442 --> 29:40.577
Which is just so...
It's so earned.

29:40.611 --> 29:43.848
There can be no excuse for the
crime of which I'm guilty.

29:43.881 --> 29:45.449
I intend to offer no defense.

29:45.481 --> 29:47.384
Furthermore,
I shall order Mr. Scott

29:47.417 --> 29:48.952
to take immediate command
of this vessel.

29:48.986 --> 29:50.955
Don't you think you'd
better check with me first?

29:50.988 --> 29:52.190
Captain!

29:53.490 --> 29:54.793
Jim!

30:01.498 --> 30:05.870
I'm... pleased
to see you, Captain.

30:05.903 --> 30:09.007
You seem... uninjured.

30:10.941 --> 30:12.442
What is the purpose of a toy?

30:12.476 --> 30:13.744
To be played with.

30:13.778 --> 30:17.048
Therefore, to not play
with it would be...

30:17.080 --> 30:18.182
Illogical.

30:18.214 --> 30:21.084
Damn it, Spock,
you're right.

30:21.117 --> 30:27.557
You can look at a lot of
progenitor characters for Sheldon,

30:27.590 --> 30:32.529
but absolutely, absolutely one
of them is Spock. Absolutely.

30:32.563 --> 30:37.101
And in fact,
in the episode

30:37.134 --> 30:41.873
in which Sheldon is interviewed
for this very documentary

30:41.905 --> 30:45.275
that I am currently
speaking to you in,

30:45.308 --> 30:47.310
one of the things
Sheldon talks about

30:47.344 --> 30:49.480
is his desire to be Spock.

30:49.512 --> 30:51.581
And that's not a new invention.

30:51.615 --> 30:57.087
That's something that has existed for
that character from the very beginning.

30:57.121 --> 31:00.958
When I was eight years old, Billy
sparks cornered me in the playground.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.227
I asked myself,
"What would Spock do?"

31:03.259 --> 31:05.328
Then I grabbed Billy
on his shoulder

31:05.362 --> 31:08.399
and performed my first
Vulcan nerve pinch.

31:08.432 --> 31:09.500
Did it work?

31:09.532 --> 31:11.635
No, he broke my collarbone.

31:13.503 --> 31:16.506
So the script was written then
that Spock comes up behind,

31:16.539 --> 31:18.276
sneaks up behind the mean Kirk,

31:18.308 --> 31:21.112
and hits him on the head
with the butt of a gun.

31:21.144 --> 31:22.747
That's what was
written in the script.

31:22.779 --> 31:26.951
So I said to the director, "I think we
should do something different than that."

31:26.983 --> 31:29.185
He said, "What do you... What do you
mean? What do you have in mind?"

31:29.219 --> 31:30.688
And I said,
"Well, Spock is a graduate

31:30.721 --> 31:32.556
of the Vulcan Institute
of Technology..."

31:34.490 --> 31:37.662
"...where he took a number
of courses in human anatomy.

31:37.694 --> 31:43.000
And the Vulcans have a kind of energy
that comes off their fingertips,

31:43.032 --> 31:46.303
which if properly applied to the
appropriate pressure points

31:46.336 --> 31:49.140
on the human anatomy, will
render a human unconscious.

31:49.173 --> 31:51.976
And the guy didn't know
what I was talking about.

31:52.009 --> 31:55.313
But I told him, and he knew
exactly what I was talking about.

31:55.346 --> 31:59.250
And when I came up behind him, and
I put my hand on his neck, he...

31:59.282 --> 32:00.250
He's the one that sold it.

32:00.284 --> 32:03.087
He went like like that
and dropped like a rock.

32:07.458 --> 32:10.929
There's a multi-legged creature
crawling on your shoulder.

32:18.335 --> 32:20.071
I'd like you to teach
me that some time.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.477
Our minds are merging, Doctor.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.712
Our minds are one.

32:29.747 --> 32:32.150
I feel what you feel.

32:33.217 --> 32:35.453
I know what you know.

32:35.486 --> 32:38.689
I like the fact that Spock could
communicate with other species

32:38.721 --> 32:42.993
through thoughts rather than
through words. Brilliant.

32:45.662 --> 32:48.566
What in the name of...

32:48.598 --> 32:52.102
The man talked to a rock for
goodness sake and heard it.

32:52.135 --> 32:53.503
"She's pregnant."

32:53.537 --> 32:54.939
It's a rock, okay.

32:54.971 --> 32:58.742
That was good, because the rock is
not going to speak English to you.

32:58.776 --> 33:04.115
Think of how many science fiction stories
in that decade and the decades preceding

33:04.147 --> 33:06.183
where you'd meet aliens,
and the aliens spoke English.

33:08.085 --> 33:13.024
We didn't think to think
that that would not happen.

33:13.057 --> 33:15.526
You've got to crawl before
you walk. I get that.

33:15.558 --> 33:19.562
But "Star Trek" not only knew how
to crawl, and knew how to walk.

33:19.596 --> 33:20.597
It was running.

33:44.821 --> 33:48.191
The Vulcan greeting is
a wonderful sentiment,

33:48.224 --> 33:50.126
"Live long and prosper."

33:50.160 --> 33:55.132
And this too is something that was
contributed by your father on the set.

33:55.164 --> 33:57.534
We had a wonderful script

33:57.567 --> 34:01.471
by Theodore Sturgeon
called 'Amok Time.'

34:01.505 --> 34:03.174
We arrive on the planet,

34:03.207 --> 34:07.144
and a procession comes out
from the city to greet us.

34:07.176 --> 34:08.344
I said to the director,

34:08.378 --> 34:11.181
"I think we should have some
kind of a special greeting.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.583
"Asian people bow to each other.

34:13.617 --> 34:15.786
"Military people
salute each other.

34:15.818 --> 34:18.588
I think Vulcans should have
some kind of a greeting."

34:18.621 --> 34:21.625
And he said, "What would
you like to do?"

34:21.657 --> 34:23.693
And I said, "How about this?"

34:25.695 --> 34:30.134
Where it came from was
from my childhood of going

34:30.166 --> 34:33.737
to synagogue on the High
Holidays with my family.

34:33.768 --> 34:37.474
There's a moment where a group of
men get up before the congregation,

34:37.507 --> 34:41.811
cover their heads with their
prayer shawls, chant a prayer.

34:41.844 --> 34:44.214
My father said, "Don't look."

34:44.248 --> 34:47.451
I'm about eight or nine years
old, so I snuck a peek.

34:47.483 --> 34:50.453
And what I saw were these gentleman
out there who were doing the shouting

34:50.487 --> 34:54.525
had their hands out towards the
congregation like that, both hands.

34:56.760 --> 35:01.866
I found out later this is the shape of
a letter shin in the Hebrew alphabet.

35:01.898 --> 35:06.170
The letter shin is the first
letter in the word Shaddai,

35:06.202 --> 35:07.605
the name of God.

35:07.637 --> 35:10.740
Well, I survived.
I peeked, and I survived.

35:10.773 --> 35:13.777
But I was so intrigued
with that gesture,

35:13.809 --> 35:17.413
and I suggested that
we do that as Vulcans.

35:17.447 --> 35:20.518
Within days after that
episode was on the air,

35:20.550 --> 35:23.688
I started getting that gesture
back on the streets.

35:41.371 --> 35:45.209
You know, a lot of times people ask me
what it was like living with Spock,

35:45.242 --> 35:47.945
and for the most part,
during that period,

35:47.978 --> 35:50.681
Dad was not home much at all.
I didn't see him.

35:50.713 --> 35:55.385
He was really focused on what
he was doing at the studio

35:55.418 --> 35:56.786
and for the show.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.489
His usual routine during the week
was he would get up very early.

35:59.523 --> 36:02.793
He'd come home at 7:00
or 8:00 at night,

36:02.826 --> 36:05.329
eat his dinner,
memorize his lines.

36:05.362 --> 36:06.864
He'd run the lines
with my mother

36:06.896 --> 36:08.965
and then just go to sleep
and start all over again.

36:08.998 --> 36:11.434
So during the week,
he wasn't around hardly at all.

36:11.467 --> 36:14.904
We spent a lot of, you know,
our, quite a few years...

36:14.938 --> 36:17.273
Actually, from "Star Trek"
to "Mission,"

36:17.306 --> 36:20.577
with him not being home
during the weekdays.

36:20.610 --> 36:22.645
Even when Dad was
around at home,

36:22.679 --> 36:24.847
oftentimes, he was
very quiet and remote.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.951
He was still kind of
in his Spock bag,

36:26.983 --> 36:28.619
because he liked
to stay in character.

36:28.652 --> 36:30.788
You play a character
like that...

36:30.820 --> 36:34.657
What? Eight, 10, 12 hours
a day, five days a week,

36:34.690 --> 36:37.894
most of your waking life then
is in that character.-

36:37.927 --> 36:42.532
And I'd find it very difficult
to turn it on and turn it off.

36:42.565 --> 36:46.369
So stepping out of the set and into
a chair waiting for the next setup,

36:46.402 --> 36:47.503
I couldn't shift out of it.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.407
I believed in making that
investment in the character.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.277
Particularly, that kind of
character that was so boxed.

36:53.309 --> 36:57.480
A lot of the time he wasn't
available to hang out with,

36:57.514 --> 37:00.517
to... do things with.

37:00.550 --> 37:03.653
He was... He was
sort of in his world.

37:03.686 --> 37:06.389
He was occasionally
Leonard-like,

37:06.422 --> 37:08.524
but mostly, he was Spock.

37:08.557 --> 37:10.628
So I never really got
to know him very well.

37:10.661 --> 37:14.298
I got to know Spock a little bit
better than I got to know your dad.

37:14.331 --> 37:17.300
I mean, he was totally dedicated
to playing that character

37:17.333 --> 37:19.335
and to being that character,
and it showed.

37:19.369 --> 37:23.340
If I stay in character
or kind of don't joke around,

37:23.373 --> 37:25.775
it's more a function of me...

37:25.809 --> 37:29.713
It's slightly closer
to being a panicked grip

37:29.746 --> 37:32.983
than it is being an artist,
I'm afraid.

37:33.016 --> 37:34.617
It's just, I don't
want to lose it.

37:34.650 --> 37:37.654
You kind of have to get
into the character's head.

37:37.688 --> 37:40.624
And if you come out of it,
and then they go, "Roll camera,"

37:40.657 --> 37:42.593
if you're off by that much,

37:42.626 --> 37:46.464
you could either underplay a
moment or overplay a moment.

37:52.034 --> 37:54.672
Fan mail started
arriving pretty regularly

37:54.704 --> 37:56.172
in late '66,

37:56.206 --> 37:59.542
and there was some issue whether or
not the studio would handle the mail,

37:59.576 --> 38:01.110
the network would
handle the mail.

38:01.143 --> 38:03.313
They didn't want to do it. They wanted,
you know, Leonard to handle the mail,

38:03.347 --> 38:05.615
which he did in his
office for a while.

38:05.648 --> 38:07.583
There was an interview
in "16 Magazine,"

38:07.617 --> 38:09.519
I think it was
the spring of '67,

38:09.552 --> 38:14.458
and somehow, accidentally,
they published our home address

38:14.490 --> 38:17.327
as the mailing address
for the fan mail.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.396
Within days, the mailman
stopped coming.

38:20.429 --> 38:23.966
It was a truck that arrived
with sacks of mail,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.536
and we were answering it.

38:26.570 --> 38:27.871
It came into our dining room.

38:27.903 --> 38:29.873
We had the dining room
table all set up

38:29.905 --> 38:31.173
with the mail that we opened,

38:31.208 --> 38:35.112
and we stuffed envelopes with
this early Spock promo picture.

38:35.144 --> 38:37.880
It was one of
our "family activities,"

38:37.914 --> 38:39.350
you know, was
answering fan mail.

38:39.382 --> 38:40.650
Personal life was gone.

38:40.684 --> 38:42.086
Yeah, it started
happening very fast.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.088
And to show you how naive I was,

38:44.121 --> 38:46.757
at that time, I still had my
phone listed in the phone book,

38:46.789 --> 38:48.025
and my address,
and it was all...

38:48.057 --> 38:49.726
You know, I'd never dreamed
that there was going to be any,

38:49.760 --> 38:53.497
that kind of impact, because I'd been on
television before and done movies before,

38:53.530 --> 38:55.632
and I was listed in the phone
book. Didn't matter to me.

38:55.664 --> 38:58.501
We started getting a lot of
fan mail, not only fan mail,

38:58.534 --> 39:01.971
but fans coming to our door,
knocking down the door.

39:02.005 --> 39:04.375
We started getting people driving
by the house, and parking,

39:04.407 --> 39:07.411
and ripping at the shrubbery
to have a souvenir, you know,

39:07.443 --> 39:10.146
and taking my grass,
and my leaves, and whatever.

39:10.179 --> 39:11.614
Some of them would
knock on the door

39:11.648 --> 39:13.717
and ask to be
invited in to visit.

39:13.750 --> 39:17.420
It got really crazy. Yeah, yeah.

39:17.454 --> 39:19.090
It got really crazy
for a while.

39:21.590 --> 39:23.159
What about when
you came back to Boston

39:23.193 --> 39:24.228
during the "Star Trek" years?

39:24.260 --> 39:26.563
Yeah, that was
kind of exciting

39:26.596 --> 39:28.431
and a little difficult.

39:30.634 --> 39:33.036
People were following me
in the street,

39:33.068 --> 39:35.706
and I didn't really want people
to know where I was living.

39:35.739 --> 39:37.507
I was staying with my folks,
with your grandparents.

39:37.541 --> 39:38.642
Right.

39:38.675 --> 39:42.545
And they didn't have any idea
what "Star Trek" was.

39:42.579 --> 39:44.114
They didn't get it.

39:44.146 --> 39:46.549
All they knew was
something had happened.

39:46.583 --> 39:48.585
How did they react
when they saw your haircut?

39:48.617 --> 39:51.020
My dad actually thought
I was wearing a wig.

39:51.054 --> 39:55.125
He had a picture of me as Spock
up on the wall in the barbershop,

39:55.157 --> 39:57.693
and kids would come in and say,
"I want a Spock haircut."

40:02.164 --> 40:04.802
Once word filtered through
to network executives

40:04.835 --> 40:06.970
about Spock's popularity,
they said to Roddenberry,

40:07.003 --> 40:10.807
"Say, why aren't you doing more
with that Martian on the show?"

40:10.840 --> 40:13.043
There's that element
of competition,

40:13.076 --> 40:14.911
particularly the first season,

40:14.945 --> 40:21.018
because... the titular
star was Bill Shatner.

40:21.050 --> 40:24.554
Leonard was
the secondary character.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.825
But when the show
went on the air,

40:27.858 --> 40:32.963
people were absolutely
magnetically attracted to Spock.

40:32.996 --> 40:35.932
So I'm asked to be the captain,

40:35.965 --> 40:39.735
and it's the captain's show,
and that's great.

40:39.768 --> 40:45.641
Quite frequently, another character
rises to the top as well.

40:45.675 --> 40:48.612
I go to Roddenberry,

40:48.644 --> 40:51.449
who then says very wisely...

40:52.916 --> 40:57.054
"If Spock is popular,
then Kirk is popular,

40:57.086 --> 41:00.623
and the show is popular,
and that's what we all want."

41:00.657 --> 41:02.259
And I thought,
"You know, he's right."

41:02.291 --> 41:05.228
And from that moment on,

41:05.262 --> 41:07.898
I encompassed
the popularity of Spock,

41:07.931 --> 41:13.570
and, was okay with it,
and, enjoyed it.

41:17.172 --> 41:20.676
Jim, I feel friendship for you.

41:20.710 --> 41:22.045
I'm ashamed.

41:22.077 --> 41:24.681
You've got to hear me!

41:24.713 --> 41:27.884
Kirk is the physical
embodiment of the show,

41:27.918 --> 41:31.521
and Spock is the spiritual
embodiment of the show.

41:31.554 --> 41:36.659
And I think it's how
these two guys carved out

41:36.693 --> 41:40.664
their specific spaces
in this little universe.

41:52.309 --> 41:55.812
Kirk was always doing
wild and crazy things

41:55.844 --> 41:57.280
and sleeping with aliens,

41:57.313 --> 41:59.582
and Spock was always thoughtful,

41:59.615 --> 42:01.684
and moving in
a very deliberate way,

42:01.717 --> 42:03.686
and sort of putting the brakes

42:03.719 --> 42:06.756
on some of the more physical
urges that people had.

42:06.789 --> 42:08.724
You can save it, girls.

42:08.757 --> 42:11.227
This type can turn himself
off from any emotion.

42:11.260 --> 42:13.730
I think that his Vulcan
side prevents him

42:13.762 --> 42:19.335
from allowing the testosterone in his
human side to get the best of him.

42:19.369 --> 42:22.573
And that is very
appealing for women,

42:22.606 --> 42:23.674
at least for women like me.

42:23.706 --> 42:26.175
I don't... I don't...

42:26.208 --> 42:30.346
Motorcycles, and car oils,
and, "Hey, baby..."

42:30.380 --> 42:33.215
I just... I just...
It's not my thing.

42:33.248 --> 42:35.618
I like more of
an intellectual, humble soul

42:35.652 --> 42:39.923
that kind of blows your mind
in just a conversation,

42:39.956 --> 42:41.892
and I feel like
Spock is that like.

42:41.925 --> 42:45.762
So I wouldn't be surprised why
women found him really appealing.

42:47.630 --> 42:49.799
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

42:51.800 --> 42:52.670
Kirk here.

42:54.304 --> 42:55.905
I had no idea.

42:55.938 --> 42:57.707
What?

42:57.740 --> 43:00.610
He's so much more
handsome in person.

43:00.643 --> 43:01.978
Those eyes.

43:02.012 --> 43:04.347
Kirk had quite the
reputation as a lady's man.

43:04.380 --> 43:06.616
Not him.

43:06.650 --> 43:07.985
Spock.

43:08.018 --> 43:11.688
There was just something about
him that women found attractive.

43:11.721 --> 43:15.092
He himself was kind of flirty,

43:15.125 --> 43:19.028
and women kind of
flirted with him.

43:19.061 --> 43:24.067
You only take a mate
once every seven years?

43:24.099 --> 43:26.969
The seven-year cycle...

43:27.003 --> 43:30.039
is biologically inherent
in all Vulcans.

43:30.773 --> 43:32.375
At that time,

43:32.409 --> 43:36.012
the mating drive outweighs
all other motivations.

43:46.322 --> 43:52.262
And is there nothing that can
disturb that cycle, Mr. Spock?

43:53.963 --> 43:56.066
When did you get first
interested into fellas?

43:58.768 --> 44:00.369
Spock, yes.

44:00.402 --> 44:01.704
What was it about him?

44:01.737 --> 44:05.741
He was so repressed, and you
just wanted to make him scream.

44:08.010 --> 44:09.980
I'm...
I'm rather repressed.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.182
I don't think
this is that different

44:13.215 --> 44:16.219
from the which Beatle
do you love most, you know?

44:16.251 --> 44:18.188
I like the less emotional,

44:18.221 --> 44:21.824
more, you know, kind of
obtuse, bizarre type.

44:21.858 --> 44:25.461
So I think there's always going to be
a Spock female versus a Kirk female.

44:25.494 --> 44:30.199
I was one of the first
to find them, the spores.

44:32.235 --> 44:33.804
Spores?

44:46.483 --> 44:47.151
Now...

44:48.818 --> 44:51.755
Now, you belong to all of us...

44:51.788 --> 44:53.923
and we to you.

44:53.956 --> 44:57.827
There's no need to hide
your inner face any longer.

44:57.860 --> 44:59.328
We understand.

45:09.438 --> 45:11.474
I love you.

45:13.876 --> 45:15.378
I can love you.

45:22.318 --> 45:25.489
This is the perfect opportunity
for a love story for Spock,

45:25.521 --> 45:28.290
because the spores release
all of those things

45:28.324 --> 45:31.862
that hold in his
emotions, his logic,

45:31.894 --> 45:34.965
and will allow him to feel
like a real person.

45:34.998 --> 45:39.269
And this is unusual for him.
It's unknown for him.

45:41.403 --> 45:43.306
But we're happy here.

45:45.041 --> 45:48.045
I can't lose you now,
Mr. Spock. I can't.

45:49.211 --> 45:53.016
I have a responsibility...

45:53.048 --> 45:55.085
to the ship...

45:56.085 --> 45:58.755
and that man on the bridge.

46:01.224 --> 46:03.894
I am what I am, Leila.

46:05.161 --> 46:09.331
And if there are
self-made purgatories...

46:09.364 --> 46:12.769
and we all have
to live in them...

46:14.237 --> 46:16.840
mine can be no worse
than someone else's.

46:30.152 --> 46:34.890
# Cotton candy on a summer day #

46:34.923 --> 46:39.596
# Green grass on a hillside #

46:39.628 --> 46:44.366
# Could they turn
my love around? #

46:44.400 --> 46:46.970
# Could they bring her
back to my side? #

46:47.003 --> 46:49.239
Well, he was a better
singer than I was.

46:49.271 --> 46:52.041
I mean, he could...

46:52.074 --> 46:54.910
He could sustain a note.

46:54.943 --> 46:57.079
Off-key, but sustain a note.

47:00.115 --> 47:03.018
# His love is a merry-go-round #

47:03.052 --> 47:05.055
# He will drag you down #

47:05.088 --> 47:07.591
# A trip to nowhere #

47:07.623 --> 47:11.961
# A world without love #

47:17.367 --> 47:19.436
He was basically
keeping himself busy

47:19.469 --> 47:21.503
by making hay while
the sun was shining.

47:21.536 --> 47:24.139
I mean, that was
his whole philosophy.

47:24.172 --> 47:27.009
He knew he was riding this wave,
and it was very exciting.

47:27.043 --> 47:29.346
But he also knew that it
could be over very quickly,

47:29.378 --> 47:32.114
and we could be back into the
financial struggle that we were in

47:32.148 --> 47:33.416
before "Star Trek" came along.

47:33.449 --> 47:37.152
I always told him, "You can take
the boy out of the West End,

47:37.186 --> 47:40.190
but you can't take the
West End out of the boy."

47:40.222 --> 47:41.291
I live with one.

47:43.458 --> 47:46.161
What does that mean?

47:46.195 --> 47:52.035
Well, he developed
a very strong work ethic.

47:54.070 --> 47:58.074
I rarely turned down
any paid engagement.

47:58.106 --> 47:59.942
I'd seen many
of my actor friends

47:59.976 --> 48:01.912
go to work on a series
for a few years

48:01.945 --> 48:04.247
and live up to the level
of their income,

48:04.280 --> 48:06.048
and then when
the series was canceled,

48:06.081 --> 48:07.549
they were once again
looking for work

48:07.583 --> 48:10.586
with no steady income
and no money in the bank.

48:12.088 --> 48:13.590
I made a private pact
with myself

48:13.623 --> 48:16.326
that this would never happen
to me and my family.

48:16.358 --> 48:20.329
So every time I was offered
a paid appearance, I took it.

48:23.032 --> 48:26.369
This meant that I left the studio
at 5:00 or 6:00 on Friday night.

48:26.402 --> 48:29.139
I took a red eye flight
to my destination.

48:29.172 --> 48:32.708
I'd arrive on the East Coast
around 6:00 Saturday morning

48:32.742 --> 48:36.046
and catch the last flight
out on Sunday night.

48:36.079 --> 48:37.547
I can remember a time or two

48:37.581 --> 48:40.650
when I got back to Los Angeles at 2:00
or 3:00 in the morning on Monday.

48:40.682 --> 48:44.086
I'd go right to the studio,
stagger into my dressing room,

48:44.119 --> 48:46.522
and catch a few hours
sleep on the couch.

48:46.556 --> 48:48.992
From there, I headed
right into makeup.

48:55.465 --> 48:57.233
There were a number
of photographers

48:57.266 --> 48:59.635
who showed up to take our
picture in those early days,

48:59.668 --> 49:02.672
'66, '67, and into '68,

49:02.704 --> 49:04.540
and we were happy to do it.
It was fun.

49:04.574 --> 49:06.608
I've got to admit.
It was like a circus.

49:06.641 --> 49:09.045
It was a joyride, and it
was really a good time.

49:22.724 --> 49:25.194
First, it was like novel.
It was great.

49:25.228 --> 49:27.563
It was like," we're getting
our picture taken.

49:27.597 --> 49:30.300
We're going to be in a magazine.
It's so cool."

49:30.333 --> 49:32.769
But after a while,
it got tiresome.

49:32.802 --> 49:36.139
It became sort of
an invasion of our life,

49:36.172 --> 49:38.675
and us not really understanding,

49:38.708 --> 49:42.012
you know, "Why do we have to do
this? Why is this so important?"

49:42.045 --> 49:43.280
We were young.

49:43.313 --> 49:46.048
There was one time...
I believe it was 1970.

49:46.081 --> 49:47.150
There was a photographer there,

49:47.182 --> 49:49.251
and we were supposed
to come in and take pictures,

49:49.284 --> 49:50.420
and Julie and I were like,"."

49:50.452 --> 49:52.588
We joined together, we
unionized, and we said no.

49:52.621 --> 49:54.257
You can't say no to Leonard.

49:54.289 --> 49:55.724
I've got to tell you.
It's just...

49:55.757 --> 49:58.093
I mean, we felt guilty.
We wanted to support him,

49:58.126 --> 50:00.630
but we were really done
with the whole...

50:00.663 --> 50:02.398
the whole publicity routine.

50:02.431 --> 50:04.533
We took a really good
family portrait

50:04.567 --> 50:08.304
which is emblematic, I think, of where
we were at that time in our lives,

50:08.336 --> 50:10.273
because no one is smiling.

50:17.079 --> 50:19.548
In "Star Trek", in the mid-60s,

50:19.581 --> 50:24.453
creating this character who would
soon become a pop culture icon...

50:24.487 --> 50:27.157
My dad was never
really that in touch

50:27.190 --> 50:30.092
with what was going on
in popular culture.

50:30.126 --> 50:33.530
It's so interesting that when he
was at home during leisure time,

50:33.563 --> 50:37.166
he was listening to records
of guys like Heath Mantan,

50:37.199 --> 50:39.802
and Lou Rawls,
and Charles Aznavour.

50:39.835 --> 50:43.839
Our mom was...
ahead of her time.

50:43.873 --> 50:47.610
At first, when you look
back at pictures of her,

50:47.643 --> 50:52.215
she was dressed
very, 50's housewife

50:52.248 --> 50:53.782
but still had style.

51:06.161 --> 51:09.865
Dad stayed still very, you know,
in his dressing, conservative,

51:09.898 --> 51:14.603
but Mom tried to, you know,
change his style up a bit.

51:14.637 --> 51:18.108
So he started, you know,
wearing a little cooler clothes,

51:18.141 --> 51:21.744
some jeans, the little scarf,
you know, around his neck.

51:21.777 --> 51:24.146
And his hair was done
a little cooler.

51:24.179 --> 51:28.283
Even though he had
the Spock haircut, you know,

51:28.317 --> 51:30.786
somehow he could brush it
off to the side a little bit,

51:30.820 --> 51:34.289
and he looked a little,
a little hipper, yeah.

52:00.182 --> 52:03.753
NBC failed to renew "Star Trek"
for a fourth season.

52:06.355 --> 52:09.159
A short time after we finished
shooting for "Star Trek,"

52:09.192 --> 52:12.195
I signed on with
"Mission Impossible."

52:18.800 --> 52:20.402
Before he started on "Mission,"

52:20.436 --> 52:22.338
there was a press
conference in Honolulu

52:22.371 --> 52:24.807
announcing that
he was joining the show.

52:26.876 --> 52:28.778
It was a very exciting
experience for me

52:28.811 --> 52:30.747
to be there spending
time with Dad.

52:30.780 --> 52:34.784
Although, by then, sharing him with the
fans had become a part of my life.

52:34.817 --> 52:36.786
My character,
Paris The Great,

52:36.818 --> 52:38.353
was a master of disguise.

52:38.387 --> 52:41.291
Therefore, I got to play
a multitude of characters,

52:41.324 --> 52:44.661
old men, Asians,
South American dictators,

52:44.693 --> 52:47.462
blind men, Europeans.

52:47.496 --> 52:49.264
But then, before I knew it,

52:49.297 --> 52:51.533
I was playing the South
American dictator again,

52:51.567 --> 52:55.771
and the Asian, and the old
man, and the blind guy.

52:55.804 --> 52:57.539
It got boring.

52:57.572 --> 52:59.875
A short while later,
I left the show.

53:03.746 --> 53:05.315
After "Mission Impossible",

53:05.347 --> 53:07.550
I played Tevye in
"Fiddler On The Roof."

53:07.583 --> 53:09.686
It was only the first experience

53:09.719 --> 53:12.889
in my extremely enjoyable
theatrical career.

53:12.922 --> 53:15.925
In "Fiddler on the Roof",
he was magnificent.

53:15.958 --> 53:19.695
He was very precise.

53:19.728 --> 53:22.931
He avoided every cliche.

53:22.965 --> 53:28.438
And as he grew into the role,
he was extravagant.

53:28.471 --> 53:32.976
His portrayal of Tevye in "Fiddler
On The Roof" was utterly fantastic.

53:33.009 --> 53:35.378
Probably the best
of any I've seen.

53:35.411 --> 53:38.447
-Because he was an actor.
-Like a real actor.

53:38.481 --> 53:45.455
I think he realized that what would make
that work in a non-Broadway setting

53:45.487 --> 53:49.259
was it was about him,
and his wife, and his kids.

53:49.291 --> 53:51.594
And it was
beautifully sculptured.

53:51.626 --> 53:54.663
I went on
to appear as Fagin in "Oliver,"

53:54.697 --> 53:56.432
Arthur in "Camelot,

53:56.465 --> 54:00.269
and a one-man play
about Vincent Van Gogh.

54:00.302 --> 54:02.672
In the early '70s,
Dad was in a play called

54:02.704 --> 54:05.540
"Man in the Glass Booth,"
and it was a terrific play.

54:05.574 --> 54:07.409
He really owned up to that role.

54:07.443 --> 54:09.679
And as I watched him
night after night,

54:09.711 --> 54:13.750
he was completely unrecognizable
to me as my own father.

54:13.782 --> 54:17.686
He had to play a wealthy...

54:17.719 --> 54:24.293
braggadocio, vain,
egocentric New York Jew.

54:24.327 --> 54:27.563
Not a Jewish man, but a Jew.

54:27.596 --> 54:31.867
And as the play develops,
when the Jew gets arrested

54:31.900 --> 54:36.306
as being a concentration
camp commandant,

54:36.338 --> 54:40.543
he then has to play
the meanest, most committed,

54:40.576 --> 54:46.849
most devoted Nazi officer
you can imagine.

54:46.882 --> 54:49.851
And he stands up in the booth.

54:49.885 --> 54:53.022
Not supposed to do
that in Israeli court.

54:53.054 --> 54:55.457
He stands up,
and he's in his regalia.

54:55.490 --> 54:58.295
He's in his uniform,
but he doesn't have his hat on.

54:59.527 --> 55:04.666
And when he put that
hat on, he changed.

55:04.699 --> 55:06.902
You didn't want to
go anywhere near him.

55:09.972 --> 55:13.743
- Very quietly...
- And this was him.

55:13.775 --> 55:17.446
He starts moving like this.

55:17.480 --> 55:22.851
And he marches
to the last bit of dialogue.

55:22.885 --> 55:26.456
And it gets louder,
and louder, and louder.

55:26.489 --> 55:29.891
If a director had come up with
that, he should get an award.

55:29.925 --> 55:32.495
The actor came up with it,
and he should get an award.

55:32.527 --> 55:34.063
It was chilling.

55:37.432 --> 55:41.436
The times when your dad
was performing in New York,

55:41.469 --> 55:43.138
and then we would see
each other very often,

55:43.172 --> 55:46.141
and that's when they
started to go closer.

55:46.175 --> 55:47.943
And then we became his groupies.

55:47.976 --> 55:51.913
When he performed anyplace
east of the Mississippi,

55:51.947 --> 55:54.550
we would fly out to be there.

56:06.762 --> 56:10.867
One summer, he did two plays.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.702
One in Michigan,
and one in Wisconsin.

56:13.735 --> 56:19.442
And at that time, he was flying
his own single engine airplane,

56:19.474 --> 56:22.010
and I flew a lot with him.
I love flying.

56:22.043 --> 56:24.679
So, I plotted
the entire course out.

56:24.713 --> 56:27.682
I took lessons,
and I got my little license.

56:27.715 --> 56:30.886
Not a pilot's license. I got...
They call it a pinch hitter.

56:30.920 --> 56:32.622
So that if anything
happened to him,

56:32.655 --> 56:35.425
I could take over
without a problem.

56:35.458 --> 56:41.731
And that was probably one of the
best times I ever had with him.

56:41.764 --> 56:44.834
The decade of the '70s was kind of
an interesting period for my dad,

56:44.867 --> 56:46.436
because he had done
so much theater work.

56:46.469 --> 56:48.104
He was really kind of
proving himself

56:48.137 --> 56:50.773
as the character actor
that he always wanted to be.

56:50.806 --> 56:54.476
He also hosted multiple
seasons of "In Search Of."

56:54.510 --> 56:55.645
...underwritten in part
by a national...

56:55.677 --> 56:57.846
And he was in
Philip Kaufman's remake

56:57.880 --> 57:00.450
of "Invasion of the
Body Snatchers."

57:00.483 --> 57:01.851
They were shooting
in San Francisco,

57:01.884 --> 57:03.853
and I happened to be
in school at Berkeley,

57:03.885 --> 57:06.855
and it was just a lot of fun
watching them make that film.

57:06.889 --> 57:08.758
But what happens to us?

57:08.791 --> 57:11.160
You'll be born again
into an untroubled world.

57:11.193 --> 57:14.030
He was a multifaceted
individual that is for sure.

57:14.063 --> 57:16.898
I knew that as a kid.
I used to watch "In Search Of,"

57:16.931 --> 57:19.234
and I remember him in
the Kaufman "Body Snatchers"

57:19.268 --> 57:21.704
and "Mission Impossible,"
you know.

57:21.737 --> 57:25.508
He was never just Spock
to me even growing up.

57:25.541 --> 57:29.010
We came here from a dying world.

57:29.043 --> 57:32.147
We drift through the universe
from planet to planet

57:32.181 --> 57:34.916
pushed on by the solar winds.

57:34.949 --> 57:37.920
We adapt, and we survive.

57:45.193 --> 57:47.929
Captain, I found this device
on my console.

57:47.963 --> 57:50.967
It seems to serve
no useful function and...

57:53.135 --> 57:54.704
Captain?

57:54.737 --> 57:57.840
I'm sorry, Spock, It's your...

58:00.876 --> 58:06.682
When they began casting,
we weren't... I wasn't called.

58:06.715 --> 58:09.184
It was decided that
George in the show

58:09.217 --> 58:12.687
would not appear
on the series.

58:12.721 --> 58:15.625
And I thought,
"What's happening?"

58:15.657 --> 58:17.993
Then it was announced

58:18.027 --> 58:22.664
that Bill was cast
to do Captain Kirk.

58:22.697 --> 58:25.634
Leonard was cast
to do Mr. Spock.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.903
Jimmy Doohan was cast
to do Scotty

58:27.936 --> 58:31.106
and all the other male voices,

58:31.139 --> 58:34.175
and Majel was cast
to do Nurse Chapel

58:34.208 --> 58:36.311
and all of the female voices.

58:36.344 --> 58:41.616
But when Leonard learned
of that, he said,

58:41.650 --> 58:47.222
"What Star Trek is about
is diversity, coming together,

58:47.255 --> 58:51.027
and working in concert
as a team."

58:51.059 --> 58:57.599
And he said, "The two people that most
personify that diversity in our cast

58:57.632 --> 59:00.735
"are Nichelle Nichols
and George Takei.

59:00.768 --> 59:02.938
"And if they're not going
to be a part of this,

59:02.972 --> 59:06.275
then I'm not interested."

59:06.307 --> 59:09.911
How many times does that happen
in this business, you know?

59:09.945 --> 59:12.081
It says a lot about Leonard.

59:27.295 --> 59:30.933
Tuesday, October 22nd, 1973.

59:32.166 --> 59:36.806
"Dear Adam, this may turn
out to be a long letter.

59:36.838 --> 59:39.875
"I'm very glad I could see you
and Julie on Sunday.

59:39.907 --> 59:42.010
"It was good to be with you,

59:42.043 --> 59:44.246
"but I think it might have
been especially useful

59:44.278 --> 59:46.615
"in putting our
relationship, you and me,

59:46.648 --> 59:48.250
"in a new perspective.

59:48.282 --> 59:50.685
"This came out of our argument.

59:50.719 --> 59:55.291
"I discovered you and I were having a
terrible battle on a verbal battleground.

59:55.324 --> 59:59.729
"I felt very sad about it, and all
I could say was, 'I'm sorry.'

59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.797
"It suddenly occurred to me
that it might be useful

01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:06.402
"if I tell you some things about
my relationship with my father.

01:00:06.434 --> 01:00:08.170
"I always loved and feared him,

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:12.208
"but we had very little
real personal contact.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.378
"He was not a demonstrative man.

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:18.179
"Most of my day-to-day
interaction was with my mother

01:00:18.213 --> 01:00:22.051
"with my father in the
background as a sort of weapon.

01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:25.353
Neither of them was ever
very giving of approval."

01:00:25.387 --> 01:00:27.390
You guys were at odds a lot

01:00:27.422 --> 01:00:30.325
about some of the company
you were keeping

01:00:30.358 --> 01:00:32.127
and some of the things
you were doing.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:37.099
In the early '70s, there was a
slight lull in Dad's work career,

01:00:37.132 --> 01:00:41.170
and he was at home for the
first time, hanging out,

01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:43.838
and not really quite knowing
what to do with himself.

01:00:43.871 --> 01:00:46.241
And it was also during this time

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:49.711
when he was taking a close look
at me and my life.

01:00:49.744 --> 01:00:52.414
What he saw was, to him,
not that pretty.

01:00:52.447 --> 01:00:55.083
Even though I was doing
very well in school...

01:00:55.117 --> 01:00:56.919
I was a senior in high school,

01:00:56.952 --> 01:01:00.156
and by this time, I was like
a full fledged Deadhead.

01:01:10.998 --> 01:01:14.202
I mean... need I say more?

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:16.271
I mean, you know...

01:01:16.304 --> 01:01:18.807
It was just
not a good time for us.

01:01:21.943 --> 01:01:24.846
# In the middle of the earth
in the land of the shire #

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.717
# Lives a brave little hobbit
whom we all admire #

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.920
# With his long wooden pipe
Fuzzy, woolly toes #

01:01:30.952 --> 01:01:33.889
# He lives in a hobbit hole
And everybody knows him #

01:01:33.922 --> 01:01:35.490
# Bilbo

01:01:35.523 --> 01:01:37.125
# Bilbo Baggins #

# He's only three feet tall #

# The bravest little hobbit

01:01:47.302 --> 01:01:49.004
Captain?

01:01:49.036 --> 01:01:50.438
# One day,
Bilbo was asked to go... #

01:01:50.472 --> 01:01:52.007
What in the name of...

01:01:52.039 --> 01:01:53.442
# To the caves below #

01:01:53.474 --> 01:01:55.143
# To help some dwarfs
get back their gold #

01:01:55.177 --> 01:01:58.146
Am I... seeing things?

01:01:58.179 --> 01:02:00.014
Not unless I am too.

01:02:00.047 --> 01:02:01.382
# Bilbo

# He's only three feet tall #

01:02:05.052 --> 01:02:07.288
What is it, Mr. Spock?

01:02:07.322 --> 01:02:09.090
# Bilbo Baggins #

01:02:09.123 --> 01:02:11.393
# The bravest little hobbit
of them all #

01:02:26.507 --> 01:02:30.044
Having had only marginal success
on NBC for three years,

01:02:30.077 --> 01:02:33.181
the show took on
new life in syndication.

01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:37.086
Gradually, the show and its
audience found each other.

01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:40.556
By the mid '70s, it was
becoming a media event.

01:02:40.588 --> 01:02:43.324
Thousands and thousands
of new devotees

01:02:43.358 --> 01:02:44.994
sat in front of their TV sets

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:48.998
memorizing each episode's
dialogue word for word.

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:54.135
Risk... risk is our business.

01:02:54.168 --> 01:02:56.172
"That's what this
starship is all about.

01:02:56.204 --> 01:03:00.074
"That's why we're aboard her.

01:03:00.108 --> 01:03:05.314
"Dr. McCoy is right to point out
the enormous risk involved

01:03:05.347 --> 01:03:08.984
"with interaction between
any two alien species,

01:03:09.016 --> 01:03:11.419
but the potential... "

01:03:14.856 --> 01:03:17.525
There's something that I became aware
of in doing my research very recently

01:03:17.559 --> 01:03:19.195
called The Slash Fantasy,

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:22.164
the Kirk-Spock slash fantasy.

01:03:22.197 --> 01:03:26.035
And there's a phenomenal
edited video on YouTube.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:28.838
And some fan, somebody's
taken a lot of footage

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:32.273
of Kirk and Spock out of context
from "The Original Series"

01:03:32.306 --> 01:03:35.476
to show this homo-erotic
relationship between them,

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:38.281
and it's pretty damn compelling.

01:03:49.157 --> 01:03:53.362
At conventions,
I saw slash zines

01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:56.931
with illustrations done
by very good artists

01:03:56.965 --> 01:04:02.538
and they were much, much more
explicit between Kirk and Spock.

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:06.275
It's a matter
of who is looking at it,

01:04:06.307 --> 01:04:07.675
from what perspective,

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:14.983
and from the perspective of gay
people seeing that is eye opening.

01:04:15.016 --> 01:04:19.487
They see the gay passion,
the gay attraction,

01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:24.093
and the gay anguish
depicted in those scenes.

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.273
At my first convention in 1972,

01:04:38.306 --> 01:04:40.174
I walked into a hall so crowded

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:42.644
the thunderous wall of
noise that greeted me

01:04:42.677 --> 01:04:44.946
took me completely by surprise.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:49.184
For several seconds, I literally could
not speak because of the emotion.

01:04:49.217 --> 01:04:53.055
One of the things that I really
respect about your dad was,

01:04:53.088 --> 01:04:55.024
I guess, his love
and affection for the fans

01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:58.359
and how he always
had time and energy.

01:04:58.393 --> 01:05:00.396
You know, going to conventions
and meeting people...

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:02.331
You know, I'm blown away

01:05:02.364 --> 01:05:08.137
by how much love
there is for your father.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.072
It was an entirely new concept,

01:05:10.105 --> 01:05:14.376
this gathering of fans to
celebrate "Trek" for a weekend.

01:05:14.409 --> 01:05:16.144
The organizers crossed
their fingers

01:05:16.177 --> 01:05:19.248
and hoped for 500 attendees.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.384
They got 3,000.

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:25.420
We went
to one "Star Trek" convention.

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:28.624
I think it was in LA,
but I'm not sure.

01:05:28.657 --> 01:05:29.692
I think you're right.

01:05:29.724 --> 01:05:31.960
Yeah, it was a wild place.

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:33.729
I remember them having
to get us out the back door.

01:05:33.762 --> 01:05:34.730
Right.

01:05:34.762 --> 01:05:38.232
Okay.
What was that like?

01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:39.201
Wild.

01:06:02.257 --> 01:06:04.092
I think "Star Trek" fans have
sort of pioneered

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.195
the whole cos-play culture
which now exists

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:07.695
where, you know, you go
to any convention,

01:06:07.728 --> 01:06:10.631
and people are dressed up
as a multitude of things

01:06:10.664 --> 01:06:15.070
from the most obscure
to the most popular.

01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:21.210
I've been blown away going to now these
conventions for a number of years,

01:06:21.242 --> 01:06:24.746
seeing what people are able,
and willing, and, you know,

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.249
what they commit
to dress up as and do,

01:06:27.282 --> 01:06:29.485
and it's unbelievable.

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.619
We thought they were crazy.

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:42.097
I'm here. I'm really here.
I can't believe it.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:45.201
My first "Star Trek" convention.
Watch your back. Here we go.

01:06:49.737 --> 01:06:51.706
So much stuff.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.345
Really cool.

01:07:09.356 --> 01:07:12.126
Spock, status report?

01:07:12.159 --> 01:07:15.696
Pollux IV, class M type planet,
oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:19.134
Sensors indicate no life forms.

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:23.337
In all respects,
quite ordinary, Captain.

01:07:23.371 --> 01:07:26.508
Bobak, I want you to tell me a little bit
about your history with "Star Trek",

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:28.009
how it's affected your life.

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:30.846
I would say it's probably one of the
biggest reasons why I work at NASA.

01:07:30.878 --> 01:07:33.382
I mean, honestly, like, you
know, seeing this "Star Trek,"

01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:35.583
you know, this vision
of the future

01:07:35.617 --> 01:07:39.388
is one of the reasons
why I work there today.

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:44.125
Seeing a future where people from all
different cultures and backgrounds

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:44.992
were working together.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.461
You know,
the betterment of humanity.

01:07:46.494 --> 01:07:50.364
I think that was a vision of the
future that I wanted to help create.

01:07:50.398 --> 01:07:53.402
If "Star Trek" was the vision of the
future that I wanted to create,

01:07:53.434 --> 01:07:57.172
Spock was the internalization of the
kind of person that I felt like I was.

01:07:57.204 --> 01:07:59.240
You know, as someone
who was from two cultures,

01:07:59.273 --> 01:08:01.710
you know, Iranian father,
an American mother,

01:08:01.742 --> 01:08:05.547
I saw in Spock, you know,
that same conflict, I guess,

01:08:05.579 --> 01:08:07.715
of, "Which one am I?
Am I both?

01:08:07.748 --> 01:08:10.651
Is there a happy
medium of the two?"

01:08:10.684 --> 01:08:14.523
But also at the same time,
I saw that he was accepted

01:08:14.556 --> 01:08:17.826
by his, you know, colleagues.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:20.129
Spock stood for a lot
of different things.

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:23.532
He stood for
intelligence, integrity.

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:26.902
He stood for the idea of
really searching for truth,

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.571
for figuring out
how things really work.

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:31.874
That is the underpinning
of science, really.

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:36.912
So I think for a lot of people, Spock
was representative of science itself,

01:08:36.944 --> 01:08:41.149
of using the human mind to overcome
kind of the forces of chaos

01:08:41.182 --> 01:08:42.818
and make sense of things.

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:45.420
That really resonates with a lot
of people here, I would say.

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:46.453
It certainly did with me.

01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:49.291
And I knew the minute
I read "Star Trek" books,

01:08:49.323 --> 01:08:52.260
that was the character I most
wanted to emulate with my career.

01:08:52.292 --> 01:08:55.162
Spock was a scientist.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:58.367
Now, for me, I knew I liked
science before "Star Trek."

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:02.837
So Spock and I resonated,
I think...

01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:08.341
in a way that surely helped,
but didn't initiate my interest.

01:09:08.376 --> 01:09:12.581
But I wonder if the slow
but real appreciation

01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:14.916
for what science is
and why it matters

01:09:14.948 --> 01:09:17.786
that I see manifesting today,

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.221
whether it owes its origin

01:09:20.255 --> 01:09:22.524
to that series,
to that character.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:30.298
-Are you a "Star Trek" fan?
-Yes.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.801
-How long have you been a fan?
-A hundred years.

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:35.371
A hundred years
"Star Trek" fan, okay.

01:09:37.837 --> 01:09:40.442
You've had your own
connection to "Star Trek."

01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:42.743
You've directed
"Star Trek" episodes.

01:09:42.777 --> 01:09:46.247
But before that, you were
an entertainment attorney.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.417
What was that all about? What got
you into that in the first place?

01:09:48.448 --> 01:09:52.287
You know, it's very difficult when
you are the son of a celebrity

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:55.657
and somebody who becomes
a pop culture icon,

01:09:55.689 --> 01:09:57.759
to try to create
your own identity,

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:59.861
to find out who you
are in essence.

01:09:59.894 --> 01:10:03.298
And so, this was my way of
really creating my own path.

01:10:03.331 --> 01:10:05.833
He was very proud of the fact
that I went to law school,

01:10:05.867 --> 01:10:08.003
and I started practicing law.

01:10:08.036 --> 01:10:10.005
But after seven years
of practicing,

01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:12.506
it became very clear to me
that this was not something

01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:14.009
I wanted to do
for the rest of my life.

01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:18.579
I didn't have the passion for it
that I thought was important.

01:10:18.613 --> 01:10:20.481
That was really Dad's
whole philosophy was

01:10:20.515 --> 01:10:22.484
you have to have a passion
for what you do.

01:10:22.516 --> 01:10:25.554
Otherwise, it's just work,
and it's not fulfilling.

01:10:25.587 --> 01:10:30.359
My dad was very sympathetic about
my desire to make a career change

01:10:30.391 --> 01:10:33.327
and even helped me,
trained me as a director.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.730
He and I actually
made an episode

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.199
of "The Outer Limits" together.

01:10:37.231 --> 01:10:41.403
We were remaking an episode that he
was originally in in the early '60s

01:10:41.435 --> 01:10:43.471
in which he had
a supporting role.

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:46.408
Your design and your construction
are nothing short of genius,

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.911
but even you must understand
that you're basically a takeoff

01:10:49.944 --> 01:10:54.316
on the thoughts and feelings that
Dr. Link programmed into you.

01:10:54.349 --> 01:10:58.886
A man suffers, a man bleeds,
a man has a soul.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.623
I could snap your neck
as if it were a toothpick.

01:11:01.655 --> 01:11:04.792
In that sense, you're right.
I'm not like most men.

01:11:04.826 --> 01:11:07.762
But like most men,
I choose not to.

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:09.565
Let me go.

01:11:14.802 --> 01:11:17.738
The Motion Picture"

01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:22.476
rightly begins in London where my
wife and I were vacationing in 1975.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:26.948
We went to see Henry Fonda who was
performing on stage in "Darrow."

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.951
After the performance, we joined
him and his wife for dinner.

01:11:29.984 --> 01:11:32.321
At some point during
the conversation, Henry said,

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:34.056
"You know, Leonard,
I hope you're being paid

01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:36.557
for all those billboards
around town."

01:11:36.591 --> 01:11:39.027
"What billboards, Henry?"

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:43.465
"Do you mean to tell me you don't know
about all those Heineken billboards?"

01:11:43.497 --> 01:11:46.867
Now, I'd seen my Spock image
used commercially before,

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.037
such as on a box of
Kellogg's Corn Flakes.

01:11:49.069 --> 01:11:53.107
I'd been amused by it, finding
it campy and even flattering.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.777
Once "Star Trek" was canceled,

01:11:55.810 --> 01:12:01.016
Paramount had no legal right to license
my likeness from that time on.

01:12:01.048 --> 01:12:03.685
So not only had Paramount
been marketing me as Spock

01:12:03.717 --> 01:12:06.755
for almost 10 years
without the right to do so,

01:12:06.787 --> 01:12:11.592
for the last five of those 10, they
hadn't sent me any of the proceeds.

01:12:11.626 --> 01:12:14.796
I wound up having
to file a lawsuit.

01:12:14.828 --> 01:12:16.931
They wanted to make this movie.

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:19.000
And Bob Weiss had it
in his contract

01:12:19.033 --> 01:12:21.370
that they would make their best
efforts to get me in the movie.

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.105
And my agent would
call me and say,

01:12:23.137 --> 01:12:24.506
"They wanna talk to you about the 'Star
Trek' movie." And I would say...

01:12:24.539 --> 01:12:27.943
"When we settle the lawsuit, I'll
talk about acting in their movie,"

01:12:27.975 --> 01:12:30.746
because I thought
that's my leverage.

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:32.647
So that went on for some time.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.885
And... finally, I got a call

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:38.686
from a guy who introduced
himself to me.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.622
He said, "My name
is Jeff Katzenberg,

01:12:40.654 --> 01:12:42.724
and I've just gone to
work for Paramount."

01:12:42.756 --> 01:12:47.161
And I was acting in "Equus" on
Broadway at the time in New York.

01:12:47.194 --> 01:12:50.097
So there goes little Jeffrey
off trotting to New York...

01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:53.969
...to say to him, "You've got
to put the ears back on."

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.937
So I went, and I saw the show,

01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:58.106
and after the show,
we went to Joe Allen's.

01:12:58.139 --> 01:13:02.644
I said to him, "We're going
to make the movie.

01:13:02.676 --> 01:13:04.779
"Those ears are going on.

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:08.949
"They're either going on you, or they're
actually going to go on somebody else,

01:13:08.983 --> 01:13:11.019
"but they are going to go on.

01:13:11.051 --> 01:13:16.056
And how badly will you feel
when you didn't put them on?"

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:20.729
The big leverage that he always
had beginning with these movies

01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:24.932
was that Paramount Pictures
needed him,

01:13:24.966 --> 01:13:27.936
and they couldn't make a "Star
Trek" movie without him.

01:13:27.969 --> 01:13:29.471
Finally, my lawyer called.

01:13:29.503 --> 01:13:34.208
"Look, Paramount is actually showing
some willingness to reach an agreement.

01:13:34.242 --> 01:13:37.212
"Will you read the script
if they settle the lawsuit?"

01:13:37.244 --> 01:13:38.947
"Yes."

01:13:38.979 --> 01:13:41.916
Four days later, on a Friday
evening, the lawsuit settled.

01:13:41.949 --> 01:13:44.685
My lawyer came to my
house with a check.

01:13:44.719 --> 01:13:47.122
An hour later,
the script arrived.

01:13:47.154 --> 01:13:50.192
I sat down and read it
through that night.

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:51.993
Leonard Nimoy was
the last person

01:13:52.025 --> 01:13:56.497
to join the movie cast and was
asked why he was a hold out.

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:58.065
I don't think it was
a question of hold out.

01:13:58.099 --> 01:14:02.103
We've had a long and...
complicated relationship,

01:14:02.136 --> 01:14:04.973
I mean, Paramount and myself,
for the last couple of years.

01:14:05.006 --> 01:14:06.842
And probably the thing
that took the most time

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:09.043
is the fact that
the mail service

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:11.814
between here and Vulcan
is still pretty slow.

01:14:19.787 --> 01:14:21.457
Spock.

01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:27.628
Making that first movie was
very, very dis-spiriting,

01:14:27.662 --> 01:14:29.130
very depressing.

01:14:29.162 --> 01:14:31.165
We had a bad script,
bad script.

01:14:31.198 --> 01:14:33.134
It just never worked.
It was always a struggle

01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:37.039
to try to figure out how to bring
some life to this... project.

01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:43.744
And, we did our best,
but I never...

01:14:43.778 --> 01:14:48.750
The pendulum swung completely
when that first movie came along

01:14:48.783 --> 01:14:52.621
from being an actor and
character-oriented "Star Trek"

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.689
to an effects-oriented
"Star Trek."

01:14:54.721 --> 01:14:56.791
And the feeling was, "We
didn't have the money before.

01:14:56.823 --> 01:14:59.059
Now we've got the money, we've got
to give them a big effects movie."

01:14:59.092 --> 01:15:01.695
So it was all about the ship, the ship,
and this effect, and that effect,

01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:02.865
and we're going
through this thing.

01:15:06.634 --> 01:15:08.237
Now, we're going
through that thing.

01:15:10.003 --> 01:15:12.774
Nothing about the characters.

01:15:12.806 --> 01:15:16.911
So it was frustrating, and
depressing, and, very painful.

01:15:31.359 --> 01:15:32.628
Khan.

01:15:33.661 --> 01:15:36.230
Khan!

01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:41.036
In "Star Trek II," the lure that
Harve Bennett gave him was,

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:44.306
"You're going to have the greatest
death scene of all time."

01:15:44.338 --> 01:15:46.041
Spock, no!

01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:56.718
I thought that was
the final "Star Trek" movie,

01:15:56.751 --> 01:15:58.686
and when they said to me,
"How about a death scene?"

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.588
I thought, "Why not? If this
is the end of 'Star Trek,'

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.657
"let's get out in a blaze of
glory saving the Enterprise.

01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:05.626
You know,
be a hero and die."

01:16:09.697 --> 01:16:11.766
Live long...

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:13.902
and prosper.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.757
Sooner than I realized,
it was over.

01:16:35.789 --> 01:16:37.626
No.

01:16:37.658 --> 01:16:41.128
I stripped off the ears,
the makeup, the uniform,

01:16:41.162 --> 01:16:43.632
and so Spock
gradually disappeared,

01:16:43.664 --> 01:16:46.768
leaving behind
only Leonard Nimoy.

01:16:48.703 --> 01:16:51.640
Never again the raised eyebrow.

01:16:51.672 --> 01:16:55.777
Never again the delicious
teasing of the irascible doctor

01:16:55.810 --> 01:17:00.048
or the offering of logic to my
impetuous friend and captain.

01:17:00.081 --> 01:17:03.318
Never again the mind meld,
the neck pinch,

01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:05.819
or the Vulcan salute
and blessing,

01:17:05.853 --> 01:17:08.023
live long and prosper.

01:17:08.055 --> 01:17:13.160
I asked myself,
"What have I done?"

01:17:13.194 --> 01:17:15.864
Well, of course, they put in a little
footage at the end of the movie

01:17:15.896 --> 01:17:19.134
that suggested that this might
not be the end of Spock.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:22.671
I'm sorry, Doctor. I have no
time to discuss this logically.

01:17:27.007 --> 01:17:28.409
Remember.

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:29.744
And they came to me,
sure enough,

01:17:29.777 --> 01:17:31.680
after the picture opened
and did business,

01:17:31.712 --> 01:17:34.014
and they called me
in for a meeting.

01:17:34.047 --> 01:17:35.916
They said, "We'd like to know if you'd like
to be involved in another 'Star Trek' movie?"

01:17:35.949 --> 01:17:37.719
And I said,
"Yes, I'd like to direct it."

01:17:37.752 --> 01:17:42.390
I remember distinctly one night
I got a phone call from him.

01:17:42.422 --> 01:17:45.059
And he said he'd been on the
phone with Michael Eisner,

01:17:45.092 --> 01:17:48.430
and that Michael Eisner was trying
to talk him out of directing,

01:17:48.462 --> 01:17:50.864
making his directing debut

01:17:50.898 --> 01:17:54.703
directing himself in a
feature film and so forth.

01:17:54.735 --> 01:17:59.206
And he was asking me...
He was soliciting my advice.

01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:02.176
I said, "Well,
it's really very simple.

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:07.815
Are you prepared to let this
ship sail without you?"

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:09.284
And he said, "Absolutely."

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:12.220
I said, "Then sit tight You're
going to direct the movie."

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:15.856
My Lord, the ship appears
to be deserted.

01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:18.359
How can that be?
They're hiding.

01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:22.229
Yes, sir, but the bridge seems
to be run by a computer.

01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:23.731
It is the only thing speaking.

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.167
Speaking?

01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:27.868
Let me hear.

01:18:27.902 --> 01:18:33.507
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:35.342
Get out!

01:18:35.376 --> 01:18:36.911
Get out of there!

01:18:36.944 --> 01:18:39.748
I got a call before the movie
opened from Jeff Katzenberg,

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.283
who was head of production
at Paramount at the time,

01:18:42.315 --> 01:18:44.184
and he said, "We want you
to make another one."

01:18:44.217 --> 01:18:47.087
And I said, "You know, this one that
I just finished, 'Star Trek III',"

01:18:47.121 --> 01:18:49.457
I said, "They had a pretty
tight choke chain on me,

01:18:49.489 --> 01:18:50.992
"controlling what I was doing,

01:18:51.024 --> 01:18:52.359
"and making me answer
for everything,

01:18:52.393 --> 01:18:55.430
and explain everything that I was
doing, and justify everything."

01:18:55.462 --> 01:18:57.798
And he said... I'll never forget.
He was wonderful.

01:18:57.832 --> 01:18:59.467
He said,
"The training wheels are off.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.936
We want you to make
your 'Star Trek' movie."

01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:05.774
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood
and Friar Tuck.

01:19:06.974 --> 01:19:08.476
Where are you fellas heading?

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:12.447
Back to San Francisco.

01:19:12.479 --> 01:19:15.950
Came all of the way down here just to
jump in and swim with the kiddies?

01:19:17.217 --> 01:19:19.820
Very little point
in my trying to explain.

01:19:19.854 --> 01:19:22.457
Well, yeah, I'll buy that.
What about him?

01:19:22.489 --> 01:19:24.792
Him? He's harmless.

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:28.096
Back in the '60s, he was part of the
free speech movement at Berkeley.

01:19:29.529 --> 01:19:32.065
I think he did
a little too much LDS.

01:19:32.099 --> 01:19:35.103
LDS?

01:19:35.136 --> 01:19:36.938
Come on. Why don't you
let me give you a lift?

01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:40.340
We had our first read-through
at your house on Kashmir.

01:19:40.373 --> 01:19:44.378
And there was... He had the
whales' song playing for us.

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:47.548
And I knew then how much
this project meant to him

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:49.184
on a personal level.

01:19:49.216 --> 01:19:51.219
He was trying
to get us to get it,

01:19:51.252 --> 01:19:54.355
which to me, transcends doing
another "Star Trek" film.

01:19:54.387 --> 01:19:58.225
Although, in fact, it actually is what
"Star Trek" has always been about,

01:19:58.259 --> 01:20:01.429
which is meaningful issues
about how to live.

01:20:03.197 --> 01:20:05.567
# Just where is our future?
The things we've done and said #

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.603
# Let's just push the button
We'd be better off dead #

01:20:08.636 --> 01:20:10.505
# 'Cause I hate you #

01:20:10.537 --> 01:20:12.072
Excuse me.

01:20:12.105 --> 01:20:14.509
# And I berate you #

01:20:14.542 --> 01:20:16.177
Excuse me.

01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:18.512
Would you mind
stopping that noise?

01:20:23.050 --> 01:20:25.153
# The only choice we're given
is how many megatons #

01:20:25.185 --> 01:20:26.487
Excuse me.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.057
Would you mind stopping
that damn noise?

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.391
# And I say screw you #

01:20:31.425 --> 01:20:35.297
# And I hope you're blue too #

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:46.274
"Star Trek IV" was one of the
highlights of Dad's career,

01:20:46.306 --> 01:20:48.342
really part of the
pinnacle of his career,

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:51.546
because immediately after that
came "Three Men and a Baby."

01:20:51.578 --> 01:20:53.347
The making
of "Three Men and a Baby"

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:56.584
was a magical time where everything
came together beautifully.

01:20:56.617 --> 01:20:59.320
I felt enormously fortunate
to be involved with the project.

01:20:59.353 --> 01:21:00.320
Nice job, Pete.

01:21:00.354 --> 01:21:03.324
You know, the "LA Times"
came out with an article

01:21:03.356 --> 01:21:05.292
when that movie came out,
and it was a hit

01:21:05.326 --> 01:21:08.061
the winter season,
the holiday season of '87.

01:21:08.095 --> 01:21:12.166
"LA Times" talked about the fact that the
hit from the previous holiday season

01:21:12.198 --> 01:21:15.369
was a feature film entitled
"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:18.573
and that both of those films happened
to be directed by the same guy.

01:21:19.539 --> 01:21:20.707
Then came "The Good Mother",

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:23.912
and my relationship with my
father hit an all-time low.

01:21:23.944 --> 01:21:25.380
And you've left her
alone with him?

01:21:25.412 --> 01:21:28.048
Well, of course I have. She likes
him. They have fun together, Brian.

01:21:28.082 --> 01:21:29.617
Well, ask him about
the fun, Anna.

01:21:29.649 --> 01:21:31.652
Well, what are you suggesting, Brian,
that he did something wrong with Molly?

01:21:31.685 --> 01:21:33.153
- He did, Anna.
- Well, he didn't.

01:21:33.186 --> 01:21:35.256
She told me.
She's told the shrink.

01:21:35.288 --> 01:21:37.024
- He did it, Anna!
- No, Brian, he didn't do it!

01:21:37.057 --> 01:21:38.460
You ask him!
And you let him!

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:41.195
By the time filming
of "The Good Mother" wrapped,

01:21:41.228 --> 01:21:44.364
I felt the same way I had at the end
of shooting "Three Men and a Baby."

01:21:44.398 --> 01:21:48.569
I thought, "Boy, this could be even more
of a rocket ride than 'Three Men.'"

01:21:48.601 --> 01:21:52.439
And it was a rocket ride,
all right... straight down.

01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:54.274
Box office was disappointing,

01:21:54.307 --> 01:21:58.212
and the film soon disappeared
from the theaters.

01:21:58.244 --> 01:22:02.317
I started drinking
regularly, ritually,

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:05.553
during probably the second year
or third year of our series.

01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:09.222
The ritual became so ingrained
and so important to me,

01:22:09.256 --> 01:22:13.461
because I looked forward to that release
at the end of the pressure of the day

01:22:13.493 --> 01:22:17.998
with the dialogue, and the pace, and
get 15 pages or 12 pages done today,

01:22:18.032 --> 01:22:19.367
and all of that sort of thing.

01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:22.302
And the minute we finished the
last shot, I would have a drink.

01:22:22.336 --> 01:22:24.238
And then it became
a series of drinks.

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:26.640
And little by little, before I knew
it, I was drinking more and more

01:22:26.673 --> 01:22:28.676
because my addictive
personality was taking over.

01:22:28.708 --> 01:22:32.579
It was the martinis, you know,
getting a drink when he'd come home,

01:22:32.613 --> 01:22:34.481
having a couple drinks.

01:22:34.515 --> 01:22:38.653
And...you know, while it
made him more relaxed,

01:22:38.685 --> 01:22:41.355
he also shut down.

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:45.993
The habit grew to the power
that it did in my later years

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:49.396
because I didn't have that thought, "I'm
young. I still have a distance to go."

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:53.234
Which is a devilish part
of the disease.

01:22:53.266 --> 01:22:57.104
The 1980's were a very
difficult time for my dad.

01:22:57.137 --> 01:23:00.475
His parents had recently died,
my grandparents,

01:23:00.507 --> 01:23:03.043
within six months of each other.

01:23:03.077 --> 01:23:04.645
My dad was going through
a very complicated

01:23:04.677 --> 01:23:06.514
and difficult divorce
from my mother.

01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:08.615
They had been married
for 32 years.

01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:09.917
It was also about this time

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:12.686
that there was a lot of
head-banging between the two of us.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.323
There were a lot of old issues
that were coming up,

01:23:15.355 --> 01:23:18.658
and there were a number
of fights between us.

01:23:18.692 --> 01:23:22.363
He was also drinking. A lot of
this was fueled by alcohol.

01:23:22.395 --> 01:23:25.032
And quite frankly, I was still
getting high at the time,

01:23:25.065 --> 01:23:28.168
and that was certainly not
helping matters between us.

01:23:29.837 --> 01:23:32.273
"There's one major area
that I should touch on

01:23:32.305 --> 01:23:34.274
"before coming to a conclusion,

01:23:34.307 --> 01:23:36.444
"competition with my father.

01:23:36.476 --> 01:23:40.213
"This was easy for me
in strangely painful way.

01:23:40.247 --> 01:23:43.818
"My father never earned
more than a $150 a week.

01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:47.654
"I realize that competition
with me is very tough.

01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:49.757
"I am very loud and verbal.

01:23:49.789 --> 01:23:54.194
"Also I have been very lucky,
made good money, and I'm famous.

01:23:55.395 --> 01:23:56.797
"That's a lot tougher
to deal with

01:23:56.831 --> 01:24:00.235
"than me competing against
150-dollar a week barber."

01:24:02.368 --> 01:24:06.106
A lot of the problems that I had
with my dad were not that dissimilar

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.510
from problems that other
fathers and sons experience.

01:24:10.644 --> 01:24:12.814
The difference is that
my dad was adored

01:24:12.846 --> 01:24:15.817
by millions of fans
all over the world.

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:21.389
And oftentimes, I felt like I was competing
with them for his love and attention.

01:24:21.421 --> 01:24:26.460
And sometimes, I honestly felt
like I was losing the battle.

01:24:26.493 --> 01:24:30.664
After we would have one of these
incredible knock-down, drag-out fights,

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:36.604
I would go out into the world and be
confronted by images of Spock everywhere.

01:24:38.338 --> 01:24:41.242
# I want to know
what you're feeling #

01:24:41.274 --> 01:24:44.645
# Tell me what's on your mind #

01:24:52.685 --> 01:24:53.654
Pure energy.

01:24:56.657 --> 01:24:58.359
Pure energy.

01:25:04.765 --> 01:25:08.603
In 1989, Dad and
Susan got married,

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:11.205
and his domestic life
started to get much better.

01:25:11.238 --> 01:25:13.740
She was a real
stabilizing force for him.

01:25:13.774 --> 01:25:17.145
And he was very happy with her, and
they were very devoted to each other.

01:25:17.177 --> 01:25:20.680
It was at this period of time,
he told me later on,

01:25:20.713 --> 01:25:23.850
that he was really
happy with his life,

01:25:23.884 --> 01:25:28.221
and yet didn't really understand
why he was still drinking.

01:25:28.255 --> 01:25:32.460
And it was at that point that he
started to really, seriously look

01:25:32.493 --> 01:25:34.829
at what was happening
with his life.

01:25:34.862 --> 01:25:38.500
And he made his decision
to go into his own recovery.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.830
My first images were
photographed with this camera

01:26:09.863 --> 01:26:11.566
and enlarged with this camera

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:14.635
and with about 20 cents
worth of Kodak supplies.

01:26:14.667 --> 01:26:18.939
And I just became fascinated
with the ability

01:26:18.972 --> 01:26:21.609
to create an image,
something that you could hold,

01:26:21.641 --> 01:26:24.278
an object you could hold in
your hand, and there it is.

01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:25.512
Something I shot this morning,

01:26:25.546 --> 01:26:26.914
and tonight, I have
the picture in my hand.

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:30.218
I could hang it on my wall, or
give it to my family, or whatever.

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:31.186
That was the beginning.

01:26:56.042 --> 01:26:59.246
Although Dad started taking
pictures at an early age,

01:26:59.279 --> 01:27:02.250
he continued this hobby
throughout his life.

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:04.652
He would often take portraits
of me and Julie,

01:27:04.685 --> 01:27:07.989
and some of those ended up in
the poetry books he published.

01:27:52.032 --> 01:27:53.833
James T. Kirk.

01:27:53.867 --> 01:27:56.537
Along came J.J. Abrams

01:27:56.569 --> 01:27:58.572
who found a way
to crack it open

01:27:58.604 --> 01:28:00.807
to an entirely new
and different audience.

01:28:06.613 --> 01:28:09.750
Who the hell am I to tell Leonard
Nimoy what Spock should do?

01:28:09.783 --> 01:28:12.053
But it's my job,
so I'm doing the best I can.

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:14.454
But I was amazed
at how open he was.

01:28:14.488 --> 01:28:18.626
Leonard was okay with the idea of
this new incarnation of "Star Trek."

01:28:18.658 --> 01:28:24.497
It set a tone on the set even beyond
the days that Leonard was working.

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:27.033
You didn't have to know
all about "Star Trek."

01:28:27.067 --> 01:28:28.402
You could come
and enjoy this movie

01:28:28.435 --> 01:28:31.372
as a person who had never seen
anything of "Star Trek" before.

01:28:31.404 --> 01:28:32.806
-Fascinating.
-What?

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.408
Okay, I'm sure
you're just doing your job,

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.344
but could you not come
a wee bit sooner?

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:39.013
Six months I've been here living
off Star Fleet protein nibs

01:28:39.046 --> 01:28:40.881
and the promise of a good meal.

01:28:40.913 --> 01:28:42.381
Myself, Leonard, and Chris
shared a trailer

01:28:42.416 --> 01:28:46.052
when we were shooting the stuff when
they discover Scotty on the planet.

01:28:46.086 --> 01:28:48.823
And it was quite far from the
circus, from the unit base,

01:28:48.855 --> 01:28:52.425
so we had a trailer that
we just sat in, and we shared.

01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:53.827
And we were shooting
really late at night.

01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:55.863
It was, like, you know, 2:00
or 3:00 in the morning.

01:28:55.895 --> 01:28:57.997
And Chris, Leonard, and I
were just sat in this...

01:28:58.030 --> 01:29:01.001
And Leonard was in his
full Spock regalia, ears.

01:29:01.033 --> 01:29:03.536
We had the big sort of like
winter coat on and stuff,

01:29:03.569 --> 01:29:06.539
and he sat upright,
and he went to sleep.

01:29:06.573 --> 01:29:11.011
And he, was just sat there
just quietly snoring.

01:29:11.043 --> 01:29:14.114
And Chris and I were just
looking at each other like,

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:16.617
"That's Spock, and he snores."

01:29:17.717 --> 01:29:19.753
We were shooting a scene,
and Leonard was walking,

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:26.694
and he fell... and he landed,
and he cut and broke his nose.

01:29:28.561 --> 01:29:32.766
So the feeling that,
you know, you have

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:37.070
when someone that you care about as
much as I did, of course, gets hurt,

01:29:37.104 --> 01:29:39.073
it's a horrible feeling.

01:29:39.105 --> 01:29:41.574
When you've wounded Spock...

01:29:41.608 --> 01:29:44.412
you just wanna...
you know, kill yourself.

01:29:44.444 --> 01:29:46.646
It's just... It was...
It was horrible.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:49.650
And we're trying to figure out what
we're gonna do for the rest of the day,

01:29:49.682 --> 01:29:52.520
and I hear, like, "No, no, no,
no, we're going to keep going."

01:29:52.552 --> 01:29:53.820
And it was Leonard
who was like,

01:29:53.854 --> 01:29:55.356
"We're just gonna
keep shooting."

01:29:55.389 --> 01:30:00.127
And I'm thinking, "Is he out of his
fucking mind? He just broke his nose."

01:30:00.159 --> 01:30:02.061
And Leonard was like,
"Let's keep going."

01:30:02.095 --> 01:30:04.965
And we finished, and no one
ever heard this story publicly

01:30:04.997 --> 01:30:07.999
until you and I had
this conversation.

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.739
Speak your mind, Spock.

01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:17.711
That would be unwise.

01:30:17.743 --> 01:30:21.047
Mine is a very different
Spock than your dad's.

01:30:21.081 --> 01:30:25.953
I was really fortunate to be able
to explore even more than your dad,

01:30:25.985 --> 01:30:28.456
because as entertainment
evolved,

01:30:28.488 --> 01:30:30.623
as narration evolved,
as story-telling evolved

01:30:30.657 --> 01:30:32.092
over the intervening decades

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:35.662
between when he created the
role and when I assumed it,

01:30:35.695 --> 01:30:39.699
I think that it opened up
a little bit more space

01:30:39.733 --> 01:30:42.503
for us to get in
and play with that.

01:30:45.771 --> 01:30:47.908
Mr. Spock.

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:52.479
Sharing that with him, and
discussing it, and exploring it

01:30:52.512 --> 01:30:55.615
through the context
of our personal relationship,

01:30:55.649 --> 01:30:58.853
that was probably one of the most
creatively satisfying aspects

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:02.856
of assuming a role that had already
been established so firmly

01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:04.859
and created so boldly.

01:31:04.891 --> 01:31:06.193
No pun intended.

01:31:06.226 --> 01:31:11.731
Should I choose to complete the
Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr

01:31:11.765 --> 01:31:13.968
and purge all emotion...

01:31:15.836 --> 01:31:19.173
I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgment upon you.

01:31:21.807 --> 01:31:25.778
Spock...

01:31:25.811 --> 01:31:29.216
as always, whatever
you choose to be...

01:31:30.317 --> 01:31:33.052
you will have a proud mother.

01:31:33.086 --> 01:31:37.123
Every time he goes
into a negative place,

01:31:37.157 --> 01:31:39.293
he starts being a little
bit of a pessimist,

01:31:39.326 --> 01:31:45.599
he allows Uhura and Kirk
to snap him out of it.

01:31:45.631 --> 01:31:47.701
And I really like that.

01:31:47.734 --> 01:31:51.672
He's just... He's a man to me.
Like, Spock is really a man.

01:31:51.704 --> 01:31:53.673
Even though
he's half alien, it's like...

01:31:53.707 --> 01:31:56.911
He could have been...
I don't know, half anything,

01:31:56.944 --> 01:32:00.981
but he's still
very much... natural.

01:32:07.287 --> 01:32:10.224
What do you need? Tell me.

01:32:10.256 --> 01:32:12.125
Tell me.

01:32:12.158 --> 01:32:15.094
I thought that was
a perfect example

01:32:15.127 --> 01:32:17.331
of the evolution
of the character,

01:32:17.363 --> 01:32:19.899
of painting him
in a different light

01:32:19.932 --> 01:32:24.604
and seeing that there is
this capacity for feeling,

01:32:24.637 --> 01:32:27.307
for emotion, for intimacy,
for connection.

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:29.076
It's still regulated.

01:32:29.109 --> 01:32:32.246
It's still within the
boundaries or the parameters

01:32:32.279 --> 01:32:34.215
of what it means to be Vulcan.

01:32:38.685 --> 01:32:40.087
Father.

01:32:48.395 --> 01:32:50.765
I am not our father.

01:32:57.938 --> 01:33:00.641
There are so few Vulcans left,

01:33:00.673 --> 01:33:03.109
we cannot afford
to ignore each other.

01:33:03.143 --> 01:33:06.913
Spock, in this case,
do yourself a favor.

01:33:08.314 --> 01:33:11.985
Put aside logic.
Do what feels right.

01:33:17.724 --> 01:33:21.028
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self-serving,

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:24.965
I shall simply say... good luck.

01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:29.036
Dad was really happy

01:33:29.069 --> 01:33:31.205
to be in the new incarnation
of "Star Trek."

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:34.008
It was a high point for him.

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:36.976
But much like Spock's
problems with his father,

01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:39.913
my relationship with my father
was still very troubled.

01:33:39.945 --> 01:33:42.315
My first officer,
Commander Spock.

01:33:42.349 --> 01:33:44.083
Vulcan honors us
with your presence.

01:33:44.117 --> 01:33:45.820
We come to serve.

01:33:48.954 --> 01:33:50.858
Your service honors us,
Captain.

01:33:50.890 --> 01:33:52.192
Thank you.

01:33:55.362 --> 01:33:59.800
Around 2006, we were just about
completely estranged from one another.

01:33:59.832 --> 01:34:02.402
Old issues were flaring up.

01:34:02.435 --> 01:34:05.104
And, I was at a low
point in my life.

01:34:05.137 --> 01:34:07.140
I had just ended
an 18-year marriage,

01:34:07.173 --> 01:34:11.444
and I had decided to go
into my own 12-step recovery.

01:34:11.478 --> 01:34:14.181
And it was a real difficult
time for the two of us.

01:34:14.213 --> 01:34:15.948
And basically,
for three or four years,

01:34:15.981 --> 01:34:18.051
we had very, very
little communication.

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:22.823
By around 2008, we started to
talk again, and reconnect again,

01:34:22.855 --> 01:34:26.826
and really came back together in
our relationship with each other.

01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:34.734
I had met Martha in a doctor's
office, and she was...

01:34:34.768 --> 01:34:36.069
She was my age,

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:41.375
and she was very sweet,
fun, attractive woman,

01:34:41.408 --> 01:34:43.744
and I started dating
her regularly.

01:34:43.777 --> 01:34:46.079
And I mean, I was
so much happier having Martha

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:48.282
that I married her.

01:34:51.051 --> 01:34:53.287
Four and a half months
after we were married,

01:34:53.319 --> 01:34:56.157
Martha was diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

01:35:08.167 --> 01:35:09.402
The weird thing was for me,

01:35:09.435 --> 01:35:12.305
and I was really kind of conscious
of it now in retrospect,

01:35:12.338 --> 01:35:17.778
was that in 2004,
when I left my 18-year marriage,

01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:20.246
and moved out of my house, and
left my kids behind for one.

01:35:20.279 --> 01:35:22.315
I mean, it was
a real low point in my life.

01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:25.918
I didn't even call my dad. He wasn't even
on the list, because of our period of,

01:35:25.952 --> 01:35:28.355
you know, beginning of
the estrangement period.

01:35:28.387 --> 01:35:32.425
But when I was able to
pull myself back together,

01:35:32.458 --> 01:35:34.461
after I got that phone call
from the doctor,

01:35:34.493 --> 01:35:37.029
the first phone call I made...

01:35:37.063 --> 01:35:38.498
Was to your dad.

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:44.137
I just... It still.
It just overwhelms me now

01:35:44.171 --> 01:35:47.240
that we could get to that point
where he could be my go-to guy.

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:48.309
Yeah.

01:35:48.341 --> 01:35:49.976
And in the next 18 months
of my life with Martha,

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:55.349
which were, you know, probably the most
challenging possibly in my entire life,

01:35:55.381 --> 01:35:58.918
my dad and Susan were there
every step of the way

01:35:58.952 --> 01:36:01.288
to support me
and keep me going.

01:36:03.957 --> 01:36:08.561
And after that, my dad and I
never again... looked back

01:36:08.595 --> 01:36:12.132
at the wreckage
from our past, ever.

01:36:16.936 --> 01:36:20.439
"So here we are.
You're a man, an individual,

01:36:20.472 --> 01:36:24.344
"very bright, talented,
goal-oriented, sensitive,

01:36:24.377 --> 01:36:27.447
"and a lot of other good things.

01:36:27.479 --> 01:36:31.484
"Above all, I want you to know
that you are priceless to me.

01:36:31.518 --> 01:36:35.122
I'm proud of you, and I deeply
love you. Your father."

01:36:46.399 --> 01:36:49.436
My life has become much,
much more about family.

01:36:49.469 --> 01:36:52.038
I used to... The way
I describe it now was

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:55.976
I used to major in career
and minor in family.

01:36:56.009 --> 01:36:57.210
And now, I've turned it around.

01:36:57.243 --> 01:37:00.112
I'm much more majoring in
family and minoring in career.

01:37:00.145 --> 01:37:03.149
I do an occasional pop-up thing
here and there for friends,

01:37:03.182 --> 01:37:04.952
but mostly, I'm dealing
with my family.

01:37:04.984 --> 01:37:08.421
With dad marrying
our step-mom, Susan,

01:37:08.454 --> 01:37:11.490
she and Aaron became
a part of our family.

01:37:11.524 --> 01:37:15.262
She was great in the fact
that she showed Dad

01:37:15.295 --> 01:37:18.131
that being with your children
and your grandchildren,

01:37:18.163 --> 01:37:21.068
it's very important.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.871
You need to be a part
of their life.

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:26.974
And let's bring
everybody together.

01:37:27.006 --> 01:37:29.408
Let's... Let's have
a big family unit,

01:37:29.442 --> 01:37:31.177
and we have a big family.

01:37:32.612 --> 01:37:34.347
In the last years of his life
were the times that

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:35.548
the family got together
at the house

01:37:35.582 --> 01:37:40.320
for any variety of occasions
from birthdays to holidays.

01:37:40.353 --> 01:37:42.288
Leonard was a very
even-keeled guy.

01:37:42.322 --> 01:37:43.923
He didn't always show
a lot of emotion

01:37:43.957 --> 01:37:49.630
but I'd say those times at which he would
toast the family at those gatherings

01:37:49.662 --> 01:37:53.900
were the times I maybe saw
him express the most emotion.

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:56.136
He was so grateful
to have everybody there.

01:37:56.168 --> 01:37:58.537
He was grateful to feel the love
from everybody that was there.

01:37:58.570 --> 01:38:03.010
And he was grateful to be able to
love the family the way that he did

01:38:03.042 --> 01:38:04.944
and provide for the family
the way that he could.

01:38:34.173 --> 01:38:37.677
The day Leonard died, I...

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:39.646
He was in a coma,

01:38:39.679 --> 01:38:43.250
and I, leaned over
and said to him...

01:38:51.323 --> 01:38:53.960
"You made the world
stand up and listen."

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:57.664
And I'd swear
he nodded his head.

01:41:39.158 --> 01:41:42.194
What I admired about Leonard

01:41:42.228 --> 01:41:46.666
was his willingness
to love his family,

01:41:46.698 --> 01:41:50.636
and because I was on the periphery
of it, I got that love.

01:41:50.670 --> 01:41:53.739
It made him a wonderful actor
in the work we did.

01:41:53.773 --> 01:41:56.243
And I think it
made him a mensch,

01:41:56.275 --> 01:41:58.144
probably a word you're
going to hear a lot.

01:41:58.177 --> 01:41:59.613
Mensch.

01:41:59.645 --> 01:42:05.317
A mensch is someone who's
responsible, and disciplined,

01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:06.585
and you can count on.

01:42:06.618 --> 01:42:09.322
He was just this
stable force in my life,

01:42:09.354 --> 01:42:11.457
and I knew I could
always count on him.

01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:13.894
He was the mensch of mensches.

01:42:13.926 --> 01:42:18.697
He was loved and adored by,
I think, everybody on the set.

01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:24.403
To create a character who
leaves a mark on the society,

01:42:24.436 --> 01:42:27.740
that strikes a chord
that resonates,

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:29.709
Leonard Nimoy did that.

01:42:29.742 --> 01:42:32.878
If there was a word you would
use to sum up or describe

01:42:32.912 --> 01:42:36.850
either my dad as an individual
or as Spock, the character,

01:42:36.882 --> 01:42:39.418
what would that be for you?

01:42:39.452 --> 01:42:41.555
The first word that springs to
mind for both of them actually

01:42:41.587 --> 01:42:43.657
is, I would say, is noble.

01:42:43.689 --> 01:42:44.890
There was something about...

01:42:44.925 --> 01:42:48.528
There's definitely something
about Spock which is very noble.

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.331
He's obviously a man of massive
integrity and conviction.

01:42:52.364 --> 01:42:56.702
If I had to pick one word,
it would be dignity.

01:42:56.735 --> 01:42:57.903
Artist.

01:42:57.936 --> 01:42:58.837
Integrity.

01:42:58.871 --> 01:43:00.306
Human.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:03.476
He was a self-made
renaissance man,

01:43:03.509 --> 01:43:07.948
but he had
a ubiquitous curiosity

01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:10.617
about everything going on
in the world,

01:43:10.649 --> 01:43:13.385
whether it was art,
photography, politics.

01:43:13.418 --> 01:43:14.587
Logical.

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.256
Humble.

01:43:16.288 --> 01:43:17.389
Hope.

01:43:17.422 --> 01:43:20.260
Cool. Spock was cool.

01:43:20.292 --> 01:43:24.997
I think a little bit of Spock needs
to be behind every important decision

01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:29.336
we make in our lives, about
ourselves, or with regard to others.

01:43:29.368 --> 01:43:31.770
The first word that does
come to mind is loving.

01:43:31.804 --> 01:43:33.405
Love.

01:43:33.439 --> 01:43:36.944
If it's free association,
then it's definitely just love.

01:43:38.877 --> 01:43:40.313
What's yours?

01:44:54.052 --> 01:44:55.954
All right. I got it.

01:44:55.988 --> 01:45:00.994
# Didn't know what time it was
And the lights were low #

01:45:01.027 --> 01:45:05.931
# I leaned back on my radio #

01:45:05.965 --> 01:45:12.872
# Some cat was laying down some rock
'n' roll "Lot of soul," he said #

01:45:12.904 --> 01:45:17.643
# Then the loud sound
did seem to fade #

01:45:17.676 --> 01:45:22.514
# Came back like a slow voice
on a wave of phase #

01:45:22.547 --> 01:45:26.786
# That weren't no DJ
That was hazy cosmic jive #

01:45:30.789 --> 01:45:35.961
# There's a starman
waiting in the sky #

01:45:35.994 --> 01:45:38.030
# He'd like to come
and meet us #

01:45:38.064 --> 01:45:40.467
# But he thinks
he'd blow our minds #

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:45.438
# There's a starman
waiting in the sky #

01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:47.139
# He's told us not to blow it #

01:45:47.172 --> 01:45:49.509
# 'Cause he knows
it's all worthwhile #

01:45:49.542 --> 01:45:53.046
# He told me,
"Let the children lose it #

01:45:53.078 --> 01:45:58.018
# Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie" #

01:46:13.966 --> 01:46:18.805
# I had to phone someone
so I picked on you #

01:46:18.837 --> 01:46:23.409
# Hey, that's far out
So you heard him too? #

01:46:23.443 --> 01:46:29.015
# Switch on the TV We may
pick him up on Channel Two #

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:34.954
# Look out your window
I can see his light #

01:46:34.987 --> 01:46:39.893
# If we can sparkle
he may land tonight #

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:44.931
# Don't tell your papa or he'll
get us locked up in fright #

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:53.206
# There's a starman
waiting in the sky #

01:46:53.238 --> 01:46:55.607
# He'd like to come
and meet us #

01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.844
# But he thinks
he'd blow our minds #

01:46:57.877 --> 01:47:02.849
# There's a starman
waiting in the sky #

01:47:02.881 --> 01:47:04.917
# He's told us not to blow it #

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.920
# 'Cause he knows
it's all worthwhile #

01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:10.723
# He told me,
"Let the children lose it #

01:47:10.756 --> 01:47:15.528
# Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie" #

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.131
# There's a starman
waiting in the sky #

01:47:19.164 --> 01:47:21.768
# He'd like to come
and meet us #

01:47:21.801 --> 01:47:23.703
# But he thinks
he'd blow our minds #

01:47:23.735 --> 01:47:28.907
# There's a starman
waiting in the sky #

01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:30.777
# He's told us not to blow it #

01:47:30.810 --> 01:47:32.946
# 'Cause he knows
it's all worthwhile #

01:47:32.979 --> 01:47:36.716
# He told me,
"Let the children lose it #

01:47:36.748 --> 01:47:41.688
