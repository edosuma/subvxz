WEBVTT

00:01.512 --> 00:02.653
- Chapter seven.

00:02.753 --> 00:04.534
Tom, Connor and Sarah
had a rich tradition

00:04.634 --> 00:07.096
of ridiculous arguments,
but today,

00:07.196 --> 00:08.498
they were on
their best behavior.

00:08.598 --> 00:11.460
- Connor, where might
I find more napkins?

00:11.560 --> 00:13.782
- Oh, I believe they're
in the closet, Sarah.

00:13.882 --> 00:15.303
- Thank you.

00:15.403 --> 00:16.324
- It was the anniversary
of their parents,

00:16.404 --> 00:17.625
Marshall and Muriel,

00:17.725 --> 00:18.906
and they were determined
not to ruin it,

00:19.006 --> 00:20.708
like they'd ruined
every other anniversary.

00:20.808 --> 00:23.150
- You had to throw my food
on the ground?

00:23.250 --> 00:24.751
- They confine those ducks
and force feed them--

00:24.851 --> 00:26.472
- Enough!

00:26.572 --> 00:28.994
- There are a million signs.
Do not touch the animals!

00:29.094 --> 00:30.396
- If a dolphin holds
out a flipper,

00:30.496 --> 00:32.437
you don't leave him hanging.
- Enough!

00:32.537 --> 00:34.399
- You just had to pick a fight
with the red knight.

00:34.499 --> 00:36.280
- Um, he was wearing Skechers.

00:36.380 --> 00:37.642
I'm just supposed
to let that go?

00:37.742 --> 00:39.323
- Every single year.

00:39.423 --> 00:40.604
- This year
is gonna be different.

00:40.704 --> 00:41.645
We're in a groove now.

00:41.745 --> 00:43.006
We don't argue like we used to.

00:43.106 --> 00:45.088
- What?
Connor!

00:45.188 --> 00:47.049
- Wow, I really set myself
up there, huh?

00:47.149 --> 00:50.452
- What is "Alicia Silverstick"
doing in your closet?

00:50.552 --> 00:53.615
- First of all, his name
is "Stickolas Cage."

00:53.715 --> 00:55.296
- Okay, I'm guessing
there's a backstory

00:55.396 --> 00:56.577
that we're gonna
have to hear about?

00:56.677 --> 00:59.139
- 1995, family trip
to Yosemite,

00:59.239 --> 01:01.681
these two find a stick
and start arguing over it.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.104
That's it, that's the end
of the backstory.

01:05.204 --> 01:06.865
- So to be clear,
it's just a stick?

01:06.965 --> 01:08.347
- No, it's a lucky stick.

01:08.447 --> 01:09.748
- Yeah.
We got locked in the cabin

01:09.848 --> 01:11.669
and used this stick
to break a window.

01:11.769 --> 01:15.433
- And you said it got lost.
- It did, and then I found it.

01:15.533 --> 01:18.115
- My--that's my stick!
Stop it!

01:18.215 --> 01:19.196
You know it!
- Hey, guys?

01:19.296 --> 01:20.677
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!

01:20.777 --> 01:22.078
- [grunting]

01:22.178 --> 01:24.880
- Every single year.

01:24.980 --> 01:27.022
[upbeat music]

01:29.584 --> 01:30.885
- 42 years together.
- If you'd told me

01:30.985 --> 01:33.247
I'd settle down with the same
woman for 42 years,

01:33.347 --> 01:35.489
I would have said,
"You're dreaming, pal."

01:35.589 --> 01:37.170
- Wow, so romantic.

01:37.270 --> 01:39.272
- It's a love story
for the ages.

01:41.554 --> 01:43.736
- You're just abandoning us
there with the stick twins?

01:43.836 --> 01:45.577
- Sorry, I got a text
from Amanda Conley.

01:45.677 --> 01:47.339
She's, like, the top book agent
in New York.

01:47.439 --> 01:48.860
She agreed to read
some chapters of my novel.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.301
- [gasps]
- I don't know how to sign off.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.423
It's, like, "Sincerely"?
"Fondly"?

01:52.523 --> 01:54.104
"Humbly yours."
What am I doing?

01:54.204 --> 01:56.466
I might as well just send
back, like, a heart emoji.

01:56.566 --> 01:58.948
- Wow, you are nervous,
even for you.

01:59.048 --> 02:00.990
- Yeah, it's just--this is,
like, a big deal.

02:01.090 --> 02:05.514
I mean, after Jeremiah's plan
tanked and my agent dropped me,

02:05.614 --> 02:07.235
I wasn't sure if--

02:07.335 --> 02:09.197
if anyone would want
this next book.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.759
- Yeah, um, at some point,
you're gonna have

02:11.859 --> 02:14.401
to tell your family
that the book is about them.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.583
- You said that legally
I don't have to, so...

02:18.744 --> 02:20.486
- Okay, all I'm saying
is if I had had the stick,

02:20.586 --> 02:22.127
then maybe I wouldn't
be unemployed,

02:22.227 --> 02:24.129
and President Sanders would be
in his second term.

02:24.229 --> 02:26.171
- Wait, you want Deion Sanders
to be president, too?

02:26.271 --> 02:28.092
- Who?
- Neon Deion.

02:28.192 --> 02:29.613
Who are you talking about?

02:29.713 --> 02:31.535
- Sending to Amanda now.

02:31.635 --> 02:33.637
[phone notification whooshes]

02:35.919 --> 02:38.861
- "This is the story
of the Hayworth family,

02:38.961 --> 02:40.222
"three siblings
who loved each other,

02:40.322 --> 02:42.584
but money sometimes
got in the way."

02:42.684 --> 02:44.626
- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:44.726 --> 02:46.147
- Wait, Tom, is this your book?

02:46.247 --> 02:48.789
- Oh, you sent it to Connor

02:48.889 --> 02:50.350
instead of Conley.

02:50.450 --> 02:51.672
That's bad.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.513
- Oh, my God.
Your book is about us?

02:53.613 --> 02:55.515
- What?
No.

02:55.615 --> 02:56.836
- Tom!
- Give me back my phone.

02:56.936 --> 02:58.117
- Give him back his phone!
- How do I delete?

02:58.217 --> 03:00.218
How do I delete?
- Connor, double back!

03:01.059 --> 03:03.601
Sto--Tom!
- Hey!

03:03.701 --> 03:05.683
- Stop it!
Get over here!

03:05.783 --> 03:07.204
Tom--
- Tom's fast.

03:07.304 --> 03:09.306
- Like a gazelle.
- Tom!

03:10.627 --> 03:12.569
- What is this, asparagus?

03:12.669 --> 03:13.650
- Oh, no, no.
- Do it, Connor, do it.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.051
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Do it.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.332
- No, no, no, no, no.

03:16.432 --> 03:19.154
No--
[screams and laughs]

03:20.755 --> 03:22.297
Stop.
[laughs]

03:22.397 --> 03:23.538
Not cool.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.219
- "The Hayworth family

03:25.319 --> 03:27.141
"was as cracked and uneven

03:27.241 --> 03:30.543
as the sun-scorched streets
of suburban Sacramento."

03:30.643 --> 03:31.864
Wow.

03:31.964 --> 03:33.986
- Sarah, can I just please--

03:34.086 --> 03:35.287
[phone notification whooshes,
phones dinging]

03:35.367 --> 03:37.029
- Well, since the book
is about us,

03:37.129 --> 03:39.070
I think that "us"
should get to read it.

03:39.170 --> 03:40.792
- [breathing heavily]

03:40.892 --> 03:43.914
Hey, guys--guys, I was gonna
change the names

03:44.014 --> 03:46.877
and kind of fudge the details.
I'll tell you what.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.838
You guys just delete
the e-mail now,

03:48.938 --> 03:51.160
and then I'll send you the
whole thing when it's finished.

03:51.260 --> 03:53.442
And we should really be
celebrating Mom and Dad, right?

03:53.542 --> 03:55.544
It's their anniversary.
Let's celebrate them!

03:59.907 --> 04:02.329
- Are we in the book, Daddy?
- Uh...

04:02.429 --> 04:05.092
- "These days, Tom's home
was the perfect chrysalis

04:05.192 --> 04:07.053
of dashed hopes."

04:07.153 --> 04:09.155
Yeah, I'm not
the audience for this.

04:10.476 --> 04:13.579
- Thomas Chandler Hayworth.
- Here we go.

04:13.679 --> 04:14.820
- Don't worry.
If it gets ugly,

04:14.920 --> 04:16.741
we just get in the car
and start driving.

04:16.841 --> 04:17.982
- You really think it's gonna
be that bad?

04:18.082 --> 04:19.263
- I've had a bag packed
ever since

04:19.363 --> 04:21.105
you started writing the book.

04:21.205 --> 04:23.207
- Look, I don't think you guys
come off that bad.

04:24.047 --> 04:25.549
- We love it!

04:25.649 --> 04:28.431
- This is the best anniversary
present ever.

04:28.531 --> 04:30.272
When Brenda finds out
I have a book written about me,

04:30.372 --> 04:32.114
she's gonna lose it.
[chuckling]

04:32.214 --> 04:34.476
- Wait, what?
You guys are cool with this?

04:34.576 --> 04:36.077
Even the part about Dad
having an affair?

04:36.177 --> 04:38.599
- That was my favorite part.
Muriel really let him have it.

04:38.699 --> 04:39.880
- I had no idea
how ol' Marshall

04:39.980 --> 04:41.922
was gonna get out of that one.

04:42.022 --> 04:43.924
- Now, remember,
your mother is an actress.

04:44.024 --> 04:45.085
So when you make the movie,

04:45.185 --> 04:46.606
I would like
the role of Muriel.

04:46.706 --> 04:49.648
Don't choose someone obvious
like Reese Witherspoon.

04:49.748 --> 04:50.809
- I don't think that's gonna
be an issue.

04:50.909 --> 04:52.291
- Yeah, Tommy,
the Marshall character?

04:52.391 --> 04:53.972
Let me throw this out there.

04:54.072 --> 04:56.414
What if he's, like,
a private eye with a dark past?

04:56.514 --> 04:57.775
- Yeah, that's not
really the tone--

04:57.875 --> 04:59.216
- Or it's, like,
"What's this guy running from?"

04:59.316 --> 05:01.318
Maybe he's running
from himself.

05:02.999 --> 05:04.380
- Great note.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.222
I'm just glad that you guys
are cool with it.

05:06.322 --> 05:08.384
I mean, maybe Sarah and Connor
will be cool with it, too.

05:08.484 --> 05:09.825
both: Tom!
- Wow.

05:09.925 --> 05:11.867
Really got to stop
setting myself up like that.

05:11.967 --> 05:14.309
- Tom, this book makes me
look like a maniac, okay?

05:14.409 --> 05:16.350
"Over one particularly
busy weekend,

05:16.450 --> 05:18.352
"Sarah stormed out
of Whole Foods, a Gap Kids,

05:18.452 --> 05:20.313
and a community theater
production of 'Fun Home.'"

05:20.413 --> 05:21.915
- You did all those things.

05:22.015 --> 05:23.556
- That doesn't mean
you have to tell everybody!

05:23.656 --> 05:24.957
And in this book,
I'm always raising my voice,

05:25.057 --> 05:27.159
and in real life,
I never raise my voice!

05:27.259 --> 05:30.122
Okay, sometimes
I raise my voice,

05:30.222 --> 05:32.363
but I am the only character
who speaks in all caps.

05:32.463 --> 05:33.725
- At least you come off
like an adult, okay?

05:33.825 --> 05:35.366
Every other page,
Tom had me saying,

05:35.466 --> 05:37.247
"Dope,"
and wearing Gucci tracksuits.

05:37.347 --> 05:39.729
- You do wear those.
- Ironically!

05:39.829 --> 05:42.051
Your book makes me look like
some kind of rich doofus

05:42.151 --> 05:43.412
who spends his money
like a child.

05:43.512 --> 05:45.014
Is that really
what you think of me?

05:45.114 --> 05:47.376
- Well, you are eating
the twins' vanilla puffs.

05:47.476 --> 05:49.057
- They're nutritious.

05:49.157 --> 05:51.659
- Guys, all writers
write about their family.

05:51.759 --> 05:54.261
Nora Ephron said,
"Everything is copy."

05:54.361 --> 05:56.623
- Do not use Nora Ephron
against me.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.666
- All I'm saying is that all
stories come from real life.

05:59.766 --> 06:01.828
- What about John Wick, Tom?
Hmm?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.789
Is that based on real life?

06:03.889 --> 06:05.891
- [sighs]
- Seriously, is it?

06:07.932 --> 06:09.354
- I knew the anniversary
was gonna be a mess,

06:09.454 --> 06:12.396
but my money
was on that dumb stick.

06:12.496 --> 06:14.158
And calling it "Stickolas Cage"

06:14.258 --> 06:16.259
when "Bark Wahlberg"
was right there?

06:17.380 --> 06:19.382
Barky Bark?

06:20.543 --> 06:22.324
Are you mad at something
in Tom's book, too?

06:22.424 --> 06:24.086
- No, I'm mad at you.

06:24.186 --> 06:25.887
- Me?
What did I do?

06:25.987 --> 06:27.989
- Glad you asked.

06:29.150 --> 06:31.572
"As the unfortunate souls
who married into the family,

06:31.672 --> 06:34.134
"Denise and Marina
had their own club,

06:34.234 --> 06:37.177
"'The Normals,' who spent their
every free moment gossiping

06:37.277 --> 06:39.178
and complaining
about the Hayworths."

06:39.278 --> 06:41.140
- Oh, my God.
He put that in there?

06:41.240 --> 06:42.181
- You didn't read it?
- No.

06:42.281 --> 06:43.462
I stopped reading Tom's work

06:43.562 --> 06:44.903
when I realized
he just wants to hear,

06:45.003 --> 06:47.205
"It's great, keep going!"
So I just say that.

06:48.806 --> 06:51.348
- Marina, you told Tom
about our secret club,

06:51.448 --> 06:53.470
which is supposed to be secret.
- I'm sorry.

06:53.570 --> 06:55.392
I think I was in the tub
with a glass of wine,

06:55.492 --> 06:58.354
and Tom came in, and he started
talking about his family,

06:58.454 --> 06:59.755
and it just slipped out.

06:59.855 --> 07:01.517
You know how tub wine is.

07:01.617 --> 07:04.199
- I told you things I would
never want Sarah to know.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.481
Like, "Denise dreaded summer
because it meant more exposure

07:07.581 --> 07:09.443
to Sarah's Eleanor Roosevelt
tattoo."

07:09.543 --> 07:10.844
- Oh!
- How am I supposed

07:10.944 --> 07:12.245
to trust you now?
- I'm sorry.

07:12.345 --> 07:15.248
I screwed up, okay.
But you know what?

07:15.348 --> 07:16.969
That doesn't affect
what you and I have.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.410
- You think we can just

07:18.510 --> 07:21.053
go back to the way things were?
[scoffs]

07:21.153 --> 07:22.614
How do I know
if I tell you a secret,

07:22.714 --> 07:24.215
you're not thinking about Tom
the whole time?

07:24.315 --> 07:26.657
- Don't say that!
After all we've been through?

07:26.757 --> 07:28.058
- I can't even look at you
right now.

07:28.158 --> 07:31.141
I'm not mad.
I'm just hurt.

07:31.241 --> 07:35.104
And I think we may need
some time apart.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.146
- No.
Denise, please!

07:37.246 --> 07:39.247
Give me another chance!

07:41.169 --> 07:42.030
- I don't want to be
in the gym.

07:42.130 --> 07:43.591
You go in the gym!

07:43.691 --> 07:44.612
- Guys, I don't even know
if this thing

07:44.692 --> 07:45.673
is getting published.

07:45.773 --> 07:46.794
- But once it's published,

07:46.894 --> 07:48.435
it'll be too late for us
to complain.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.156
- Yeah.
We're complaining now, okay?

07:50.256 --> 07:53.439
You have a decision to make.

15:47.008 --> 15:49.950
- Huh, why--I hadn't
thought about that.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.271
- Oh, let me get ahead of you.

15:51.371 --> 15:52.953
It's not offensive.
I'm bi.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.755
I like mostly everyone,
which is a "me" problem.

15:55.855 --> 15:59.918
But, Connor, he comes off
a little bit like a--

16:00.018 --> 16:01.600
- Doofus?
- A dummy.

16:01.700 --> 16:03.001
- I was gonna say dummy.

16:03.101 --> 16:04.122
- Yeah, how did he get
all his money?

16:04.222 --> 16:05.763
I'm just not buying it.

16:05.863 --> 16:08.485
How about you make him
a villain?

16:08.585 --> 16:09.526
Like, an evil genius,

16:09.626 --> 16:11.488
like a Bernie Madoff type?

16:11.588 --> 16:13.570
He steals money
from Tom and Sarah.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.051
Ooh, you could give him

16:15.151 --> 16:16.532
a little nasty little kink,
you know?

16:16.632 --> 16:18.534
We could market
to the "Fifty Shades" crowd.

16:18.634 --> 16:21.496
- Ah, well, I mean,
you're the expert.

16:21.596 --> 16:25.419
- Okay, make those changes,
and we might have a book here.

16:25.519 --> 16:27.701
I can pull you right up
to the top where you belong.

16:27.801 --> 16:29.803
You in?

16:35.087 --> 16:37.029
- [chuckles]

16:37.129 --> 16:39.131
I can't.

16:41.132 --> 16:44.155
- Was that a can or a can't?

16:44.255 --> 16:46.196
What was it?

16:46.296 --> 16:47.517
- The thing is, Amanda,

16:47.617 --> 16:49.619
these characters
that you're talking about...

16:51.260 --> 16:54.043
I mean, I love them.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.285
You say that Sarah
is too angry,

16:56.385 --> 16:59.848
but I see a woman
who stands up so fiercely

16:59.948 --> 17:01.449
for what she believes in.

17:01.549 --> 17:05.012
And, yeah, she has a tendency
to leave places

17:05.112 --> 17:07.654
or be asked to leave places,

17:07.754 --> 17:11.497
but that's just because
she cares so much.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.499
I wish I cared about anything

17:13.599 --> 17:16.221
as much as Sarah cares about...

17:16.321 --> 17:18.143
everything.

17:18.243 --> 17:20.465
- I do care.
- And, yeah, I can see

17:20.565 --> 17:22.466
where it looks like Connor
lives his life

17:22.566 --> 17:24.308
like Tom Hanks in "Big,"

17:24.408 --> 17:26.630
but where you see that
as immature and impulsive,

17:26.730 --> 17:29.232
I see his childlike optimism.

17:29.332 --> 17:31.073
Connor believes anything
is possible.

17:31.173 --> 17:32.835
- I dream impossible dreams.

17:32.935 --> 17:34.596
- And, yeah, your version
might sell more copies,

17:34.696 --> 17:37.198
but I want everyone
to see their family in this--

17:37.298 --> 17:38.840
everything that's flawed,

17:38.940 --> 17:43.163
and everything
that's wonderful about them.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.565
[warm music]

17:45.665 --> 17:49.048
And if you're not okay
with that, then...

17:49.148 --> 17:50.689
you know what?
I'm not the author for you.

17:50.789 --> 17:52.010
- Okay, Tom!

17:52.110 --> 17:54.172
- Ay, mi amor.

17:54.272 --> 17:56.054
- Huh.

17:56.154 --> 17:57.735
I thought with all the trouble
you had with your last book,

17:57.835 --> 17:59.457
you know, with it not selling,

17:59.557 --> 18:02.939
you'd be a little bit
more open for advice.

18:03.039 --> 18:04.581
But, I mean, honestly,
if you wanna--

18:04.681 --> 18:06.302
[phone clicks]
- Oh.

18:06.402 --> 18:08.584
- I hung up on her.
- Oh, yeah, you did!

18:08.684 --> 18:10.746
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

18:10.846 --> 18:11.907
- Oh, my God.
What did I do?

18:12.007 --> 18:13.508
I hung up on her.
- Oh!

18:13.608 --> 18:14.629
- You stormed out of the call!

18:14.729 --> 18:15.790
I would have done
the same thing.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.471
- Very impulsive.

18:17.571 --> 18:19.193
Way to be immature, Tom.
I love that.

18:19.293 --> 18:20.674
- But what do I do now?

18:20.774 --> 18:22.676
- You finish the book.
I want to see what happens.

18:22.776 --> 18:24.677
- Are you sure?
You guys are okay with that?

18:24.777 --> 18:26.879
- Yeah, it's fine.
No one reads anymore.

18:26.979 --> 18:28.761
- At least there's some women
in this one.

18:28.861 --> 18:31.203
- So they're back together.

18:31.303 --> 18:32.684
- Reunited, yeah.

18:32.784 --> 18:34.645
[laughter]

18:34.745 --> 18:35.966
I want what they have.
- I missed you.

18:36.066 --> 18:37.408
- I have so many things
to gossip about.

18:37.508 --> 18:39.049
- Can we never let our spouses
get between us again?

18:39.149 --> 18:40.730
- Yes.

18:40.830 --> 18:43.132
[both sighing]

18:43.232 --> 18:44.373
- Oh, thank you.

18:44.473 --> 18:45.775
- Yeah.
- Vino?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.876
- Oh, thank you.

18:48.437 --> 18:50.338
Well,

18:50.438 --> 18:51.739
now that I have no agent,

18:51.839 --> 18:53.541
guess I'm gonna need
all the luck I can get.

18:53.641 --> 18:54.742
I think it's time for me
to take custody

18:54.842 --> 18:56.784
of old "Charles Stickens" here.

18:56.884 --> 18:58.545
- Tom--
- Okay.

18:58.645 --> 19:00.427
- That's not funny, come on.
[overlapping chatter]

19:00.527 --> 19:02.388
- Tom had been scared
of the wrong thing.

19:02.488 --> 19:05.190
He was afraid that the book
would tear his family apart.

19:05.290 --> 19:07.713
But if the past few months had
taught the Hayworths anything,

19:07.813 --> 19:10.355
it was that they had a bond
that was unbreakable.

19:10.455 --> 19:11.916
Oh!

19:12.016 --> 19:12.837
[all screaming]
- Oh!

19:12.937 --> 19:15.039
- Oh!
- Oh!

19:15.139 --> 19:16.079
- No!
- No!

all: No, no, no, no, no, no!

19:26.027 --> 19:27.249

[door whooshes]

19:29.911 --> 19:31.912
all: [chuckle nervously]

19:32.593 --> 19:34.174
- Happy anniversary!

19:34.274 --> 19:35.295
- Happy anniversary.
- Yeah!

19:35.395 --> 19:37.417
- Yay!
- Yeah!

19:37.517 --> 19:38.818
[door whooshes]

19:38.918 --> 19:40.920
- Oh, wait--
- No, wait--

19:42.841 --> 19:43.682
- Okay, guys.
This is a little exciting.

19:43.762 --> 19:45.504
It's time
for a dramatic reading

19:45.604 --> 19:46.945
from an upcoming bestseller

19:47.045 --> 19:48.826
that's very personal
to all of us.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.948
It's drawn
from our very own family.

19:51.048 --> 19:52.589
So without further ado,
I give you,

- Listen, Tom.

20:21.273 --> 20:22.534
I've been thinking about
everything you said,

20:22.634 --> 20:24.456
and it really resonated
with me.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.137
Made me think about
my own family.

20:26.237 --> 20:27.858
Ugh, they're a bunch
of screwups, too.

20:27.958 --> 20:29.139

call them--

20:29.239 --> 20:30.981

I would love

I just have this soft spot
for sibling stories.

20:40.529 --> 20:43.631
Also, three of my clients just
got canceled for racist tweets,

20:43.731 --> 20:45.513

I hang up on you.
You don't hang up on me.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.617
- Absolutely, understood.

20:51.738 --> 20:54.000
- No, I need you to keep
talking so I can hang up.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.441
- Oh, okay, well, in that case,

20:55.541 --> 20:57.403
let me just say
it's a thrill--
