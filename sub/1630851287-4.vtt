<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> So no one in this family</i>

00:36.095 --> 00:37.352
<i> has ever bought shorts before?</i>

00:37.446 --> 00:39.038
Absolutely not.
If you want shorts,

00:39.265 --> 00:41.064
buy pants, wear 'em
till the knees give out,

00:41.116 --> 00:42.599
and cut 'em off
like a normal person.

00:42.692 --> 00:45.102
Honestly, the entire shorts
industry should be shut down.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.545
-Bunch of crooks.
-(phone rings)

00:46.696 --> 00:49.273
You've reached
the cellular device of Beef,

00:49.291 --> 00:50.957
owner of device speaking.

00:51.052 --> 00:51.958
Mm-hmm.

00:52.111 --> 00:53.777
Got it. Be right there.

00:53.870 --> 00:55.870
Now, don't freak out,
but that was the hospital.

00:55.964 --> 00:58.282
Delmer bonked his head
eating soup too fast.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.558
He just slipped
right out of his chair.

00:59.785 --> 01:01.060
-Oh, no.
-Papa D.

01:01.211 --> 01:02.135
Chairs are tricky.

01:02.288 --> 01:04.712
I want that soup brought
to justice.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.714
They're releasing him,
but he can't drive himself.

01:06.809 --> 01:08.216
I'm gonna go pick him up.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.811
Aw, it's so nice/weird
that your dad is best friends

01:10.963 --> 01:12.220
with a sweet 80-year-old man.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.222
Their personalities are
the same age.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.891
Oh, yeah, Dad and Delmer
have always been super close.

01:16.985 --> 01:19.136
Delmer's kids were grown
and moved away,

01:19.154 --> 01:22.806
and Dad's parents were fun
but absolutely bonkers.

01:22.899 --> 01:24.732
And not always around.

01:24.827 --> 01:26.085
So whenever he needed help...

01:26.236 --> 01:27.661
-Or advice.
-Or someone to help him

01:27.755 --> 01:29.737
with his homework
who knew the entire alphabet.

01:29.832 --> 01:31.239
Grandpa was pretty good
up to "Q,"

01:31.333 --> 01:32.833
but after that
he'd just circle back to "A."

01:32.927 --> 01:34.651
Dad would just go
over to Uncle Delmer's.

01:34.744 --> 01:35.594
He was his rock.

01:35.745 --> 01:36.762
Everyone needs a rock.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.322
Personally, my rock is The Rock.

01:38.382 --> 01:39.914
Have you guys seen<i> Skyscraper?</i>

01:39.934 --> 01:42.750
He humiliates
that dumbass building.

01:42.770 --> 01:43.936
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> Ding-dong.</i>

01:44.163 --> 01:45.846
Delmer's here.
And he might have a concussion.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.848
You can't have this angel yet.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.942
-You hear me?
-Who are these people?

01:50.093 --> 01:51.835
Those hippies from the news?

01:51.854 --> 01:54.504
(gasps)
He's got jimjam amnesia!

01:54.523 --> 01:56.857
Ha-ha! Gotcha!
My brain works fine.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.100
-Oh! (laughs)
-Good one, D.
-I was got.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.861
But if I ever lose
my wits like that,

02:00.955 --> 02:03.122
flip me into the wood chipper,
will you?

02:03.349 --> 02:04.456
You have my word.

02:04.608 --> 02:06.183
The doctor recommended
we keep him up

02:06.276 --> 02:08.276
for the next four hours
in case he has a concussion.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.963
Four hours?
Oh, that's way past my bedtime.

02:11.156 --> 02:14.191
I'm usually tucked in
by 9:00 p.m.

02:14.284 --> 02:17.210
Now, who has a good idea
of how to keep Delmer awake

02:17.363 --> 02:20.806
-for 240 minutes?
-I could just bust out
my pan flute and...

02:21.033 --> 02:21.865
OTHERS:
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no!

02:21.958 --> 02:23.142
-Okay.
-I know.

02:23.427 --> 02:25.293
We could tell some Delmer
stories to keep Delmer awake.

02:25.387 --> 02:28.038
You know, like the ones
Dad used to tell us at bedtime.

02:28.131 --> 02:30.040
Beef used to tell you stories
about me?

02:30.058 --> 02:31.984
Oh, yeah. Dad would tell us
bedtime stories

02:32.135 --> 02:33.710
about the adventures
you two had together.

02:33.729 --> 02:34.728
They were very exciting.

02:34.822 --> 02:35.988
Sometimes Dad would even have

02:36.215 --> 02:37.639
to swaddle me after
to calm me down.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.232
Personally,
my favorite was always the one

02:39.385 --> 02:42.310
about the thing
that fell from the sky.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.055
Sure was. Ham and Moon's, too.

02:45.148 --> 02:48.392
It's got everything kids love:
aliens, pee, buffets...

02:48.485 --> 02:50.669
Yep. It all started
30-some years ago.

02:50.896 --> 02:52.746
When a young Dad and Uncle Brian

02:52.840 --> 02:55.081
were outside of this very house.

02:55.234 --> 02:58.010
Being kissed
by the cool night air.

02:59.162 --> 03:01.180
-Beef! A shooting star!
-Hmm.

03:01.407 --> 03:03.240
Wait a second.
Our<i> Farmers' Almanac</i>

03:03.258 --> 03:06.351
didn't predict
any meteor showers tonight.

03:06.578 --> 03:09.262
But I guess nature
can surprise you.

03:10.599 --> 03:12.557
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> The next morning,</i>
<i> Delmer was at Maude's.</i>

03:12.710 --> 03:15.027
<i> Everyone was bebop'ing</i>
<i> to the jukebox,</i>

03:15.178 --> 03:17.345
<i> the waitresses were all</i>
<i> on roller skates,</i>

03:17.364 --> 03:19.013
<i> and poodle skirts</i>
<i> were poodlin'.</i>

03:19.033 --> 03:20.273
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> How old</i>

03:20.367 --> 03:22.759
-do you think I am?
-I'm describing the '80s.

03:22.852 --> 03:23.944
That's the '50s.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.112
You know what? Never mind.
Just keep going.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.598
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> Delmer was waiting patiently</i>
<i> to order his usual breakfast--</i>

03:28.692 --> 03:31.601
<i> black coffee and a hard-boiled</i>
<i> egg he brought from home--</i>

03:31.695 --> 03:33.069
<i> when, to his surprise...</i>

03:33.121 --> 03:35.881
How surprising.
You're not my regular waitress.

03:36.032 --> 03:38.275
Yeah, hon. Moira's
mysteriously gone missing.

03:38.293 --> 03:40.293
My husband is also missing.

03:40.446 --> 03:43.538
I emptied his bank account. He
would have wanted it that way.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.373
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> unable to find their parents</i>

03:45.392 --> 03:46.892
<i> when they woke that morning,</i>

03:47.043 --> 03:48.802
<i> Dad and Uncle Brian set off</i>
<i> to find Delmer.</i>

03:48.954 --> 03:50.896
Delmer,
we can't find Mom and Dad.

03:51.047 --> 03:52.380
We've checked
all their usual places--

03:52.399 --> 03:54.291
the dumpster behind
the pretzel factory, jail--

03:54.384 --> 03:56.626
-but nothing.
-So, what can I get you?

03:56.720 --> 03:57.885
The check, please.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.480
Time to go fishing...
for the truth.

04:00.632 --> 04:02.482
I thought he was gonna say
for fish.

04:02.634 --> 04:04.409
I don't suppose you think
Mom and Dad's disappearance

04:04.561 --> 04:07.304
has anything to do with that
incredibly mysterious meteor

04:07.397 --> 04:10.415
we saw last night
that crashed into the woods?

04:10.567 --> 04:11.658
I do suppose.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.143
Come on, boys,<i> kita.</i>

04:13.161 --> 04:14.736
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> So the three of them headed</i>

04:14.755 --> 04:16.588
<i> to the secret</i>
<i> government headquarters</i>

04:16.740 --> 04:17.981
<i> in Delmer's dinosaur race car.</i>

04:18.000 --> 04:19.073
<i> Dad added that part during</i>

04:19.093 --> 04:20.333
<i> Moon's heavy dinosaur phase.</i>

04:20.427 --> 04:21.835
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> Which is ongoing.</i>

04:21.929 --> 04:24.054
<i> HAM: And they raced off</i>
<i> to the building.</i>

04:25.248 --> 04:26.098

04:26.249 --> 04:28.492
Wakey-wakey,
don't die today-key.

04:28.585 --> 04:30.160
Yep, I'm here.

04:30.178 --> 04:31.586
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> Once inside,</i>
<i> they headed to the one place</i>

04:31.605 --> 04:33.179
<i> all government secrets</i>
<i> are kept...</i>

04:33.332 --> 04:34.940
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> The administrative office.</i>

04:35.167 --> 04:36.500
DELMER:
Hello. I'd like the form

04:36.518 --> 04:39.093
that's used to figure out
where all the adults in town

04:39.187 --> 04:40.928
-have gone, please.
-Mm-kay.

04:41.023 --> 04:43.448
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i>But just then, the administrator</i>
<i> got an itchy nose.</i>

04:43.600 --> 04:46.267
<i> But not on her human nose--</i>
<i> on her nonhuman nose.</i>

04:46.287 --> 04:48.787
<i> So she took her head off,</i>
<i> revealing...</i>

04:48.938 --> 04:50.030
<i> MOON:</i>
♪<i> Dun, dun, dun!</i> ♪

04:50.182 --> 04:52.940
<i> -That she was an alien!</i>
-(gasping)

04:52.960 --> 04:54.793
Ah, crud.
Did I just take my head off

04:54.962 --> 04:56.277
and reveal that I'm an alien?

04:56.297 --> 04:58.705
Hold on.
I can't see through this thing.

04:58.857 --> 05:00.357
Yep, you took it off.

05:00.375 --> 05:02.526
So, listen, we're going to put
our human heads back on,

05:02.544 --> 05:05.470
and then we can all just pretend
that none of this ever happened.

05:05.697 --> 05:08.715
Okay? Everyone agree?
Let's pinkie promise.

05:08.867 --> 05:09.716
(Beef screaming)

05:09.810 --> 05:11.417
Let go of my brother!

05:11.570 --> 05:13.145
(screams)

05:14.297 --> 05:15.889
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> And now that</i>
<i> they officially knew</i>

05:16.041 --> 05:17.149
<i> that aliens</i>
<i> had taken over the town,</i>

05:17.376 --> 05:19.209
<i>they officially had to check out</i>
<i> that meteor.</i>

05:19.227 --> 05:21.044
<i> So Dad led</i>
<i> Delmer and Uncle Brian</i>

<i> to the spot where he saw</i>
<i> the glowing object land.</i>

05:23.899 --> 05:26.307

<i> And that's when they found the</i>

05:26.401 --> 05:28.976
<i> -from a massive buffet.</i>
<i> -JUDY: Because the aliens</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:32.980
<i> had a plan that was</i>
<i> truly heinous from Uranus.</i>

05:33.000 --> 05:36.335
Bork. Bork-bork-bork.
Bork. Bork-bork-bork.

05:36.486 --> 05:37.243
Bork-bork-bork.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.245
Bork-bork-bork. Bork-bork-bork.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.506
Bork-bork. Bork-bork. Bork.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.917
Bork...

05:44.069 --> 05:45.844
Oh, poop bomb. That's scary.

05:45.995 --> 05:47.179
I hope it doesn't go off.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.348
Yeah, it used to be
just a regular bomb,

05:49.575 --> 05:52.742
but Dad added the poop because
poop really makes Judy laugh.

05:52.836 --> 05:54.186
(laughs):
It totally does.

05:54.337 --> 05:57.505
Wait, Delmer, what's
the Yupik word for "poop" again?

05:57.599 --> 05:59.933
<i> -Anaq.</i>
-(laughing)

06:00.085 --> 06:02.527
See? It's funny in any language.

06:02.679 --> 06:04.437
Oh, man.
(chuckles)

06:04.590 --> 06:06.106
Judy, may I go on?

06:06.258 --> 06:08.724
Luckily, Delmer,
the smartest person we know,

06:08.726 --> 06:10.035
happened to be fluent in Bork,

06:10.186 --> 06:13.038
so he was able to decipher
what they were saying.

06:13.189 --> 06:14.706
DELMER:
Oh, no! Countdown clock!

06:14.858 --> 06:17.859
All the numbers are in Bork, but
trust me, it's counting down.

06:17.953 --> 06:20.670
We've got Bork minutes to go.

06:23.775 --> 06:25.959
Hey, buddy.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.627
Just three hours to go
till you can sleep.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.779
That's right,
but the residents of Lone Moose

06:29.798 --> 06:32.449
-didn't even have three hours.
-Because the aliens
were planning

06:32.542 --> 06:34.208
to bomb the poop
out of Lone Moose, Delmer,

06:34.228 --> 06:36.711
Dad and Uncle Brian ran back
to Delmer's house to regroup.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.714
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> That's when Delmer decided</i>
<i> to take a think-and-pee,</i>

06:39.733 --> 06:42.292
<i> because he does all</i>
<i>his best thinking while peeing.</i>

06:42.385 --> 06:44.477
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> But then a cold breeze blew in</i>
<i> from the window</i>

06:44.630 --> 06:46.721
<i>and gave him the wiener shivers,</i>
<i> causing him to jump.</i>

06:46.815 --> 06:48.648
<i> And the alien tentacle he</i>
<i> had pocketed earlier fell out!</i>

06:48.742 --> 06:52.302
<i> Pee hit the tentacle, and it</i>
<i> shriveled up and disappeared!</i>

06:52.395 --> 06:54.471
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> And that's</i>
<i> when Delmer realized</i>

06:54.564 --> 06:56.748
<i> that the aliens</i>
<i> might have loved poop,</i>

06:56.900 --> 06:58.917
<i> but pee</i>
<i> would kill them instantly!</i>

06:59.068 --> 07:00.419
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i>It was time to show those aliens</i>

07:00.570 --> 07:03.905
<i> why pee has always been</i>
<i> number one.</i>

07:03.999 --> 07:06.407
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> Thus began</i>
<i> Operation Golden Powers.</i>

07:06.501 --> 07:08.409
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> They drank all the liquids</i>
<i> in the fridge</i>

07:08.503 --> 07:10.153
<i> and filled the balloons</i>
<i> with pee.</i>

07:10.172 --> 07:12.505
<i> JUDY: The aliens thought</i>
<i> they had it all wrapped up</i>

07:12.658 --> 07:13.840
<i> as they celebrated.</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:16.342
<i> -But...</i>
-Pee-pee-ki-yay, mother-Borkers!

07:16.495 --> 07:18.511
Say hello to my yellow friend!

07:18.664 --> 07:20.272
Pee you in hell!

07:20.499 --> 07:23.333
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> They were really a bunch</i>
<i> of catchphrase kings.</i>

07:26.780 --> 07:28.505
(groans)

07:28.523 --> 07:31.658
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> And then Delmer figured out</i>
<i> how to disarm the bomb.</i>

07:31.843 --> 07:35.679
Well, obviously
it's the brown one. For poop.

07:35.697 --> 07:37.013
(laughs)

07:37.106 --> 07:38.957
Poop. Oh, God.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.370
-Oh, yeah!
-Whoo-hoo!

07:44.523 --> 07:46.631
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> Then he freed all the adults,</i>
<i> who all still</i>

07:46.783 --> 07:48.115
<i> really had to poop.</i>

07:48.135 --> 07:49.876
<i> So they started pooping</i>
<i> absolutely everywhere--</i>

07:50.028 --> 07:53.546
<i> but with freedom and a deep</i>
<i> sense of gratitude to Delmer.</i>

07:53.699 --> 07:55.623
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> And Dad and Uncle Brian</i>
<i> found their parents</i>

07:55.642 --> 07:59.311
<i> and took them home</i>
<i> to poop in peace.</i>

07:59.462 --> 08:00.312
The end.

08:00.463 --> 08:01.295
Or was it?

08:01.315 --> 08:03.707
-It was.
-Fun story, kids.

08:03.725 --> 08:05.709
I enjoyed the poop out of it.

08:05.727 --> 08:07.877
-(yawns)
-Uh-oh.

08:07.971 --> 08:09.879
(singsongy):
Someone's looking sleepy.

08:09.973 --> 08:11.639
But don't worry, D,
I'm gonna tell you

08:11.658 --> 08:13.049
my favorite Delmer story,

08:13.068 --> 08:14.993
and it's gonna knock
your friggin' socks off!

08:15.144 --> 08:18.571
Okay, but fair warning,
several of my toes are dead.

08:18.724 --> 08:20.314
The story's about the time
that Dad worked

08:20.334 --> 08:22.483
at that summer camp you owned,
Camp Heck Yeah!

08:22.577 --> 08:24.744
Oh, Heck Yeah!
Those were good times.

08:24.896 --> 08:26.896
Sure, those<i> seemed</i>
like good times,

08:26.990 --> 08:29.991
but underneath the surface,
a terror lurked.

08:30.085 --> 08:32.177
Ooh, are we doing a horror film
set at summer camp?

08:32.328 --> 08:34.346
I'm very familiar
with the genre.

08:34.573 --> 08:35.572
I've seen them all.

08:35.665 --> 08:37.215
<i> Friday the 13th.</i>
<i> Cabin in the Woods.</i>

08:37.442 --> 08:38.833
<i> Camp Scamps 2:</i>
<i> Arnold's at It Again.</i>

08:38.927 --> 08:40.852
So I'll be able to jump in
on the story.

08:41.004 --> 08:44.097
Fade in...
Exterior. Camp Heck Yeah! Day.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.249
<i>The camp was a classic teen camp</i>

08:46.268 --> 08:47.917
<i> right out of the actual '80s.</i>

08:47.936 --> 08:50.920
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> It wasn't the '80s</i>
<i> when I worked there, guys.</i>

08:50.939 --> 08:52.939
-I'm not that old.
-Agree to disagree.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.182
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> But like all</i>
<i> summer sleepaway camps,</i>

08:55.202 --> 08:57.869
<i> there was a pack of counselors</i>
<i>who only cared about being cool.</i>

08:58.021 --> 08:59.704
<i> And the two dudes</i>
<i> who cared the most</i>

08:59.931 --> 09:01.522
<i> were Deppy and Lawler.</i>

09:01.542 --> 09:04.934
<i> They were both out to impress</i>
<i>the hot girl counselor Kinberly.</i>

09:04.953 --> 09:06.436
<i> And Duke was there, too.</i>

09:06.454 --> 09:08.772
Yeah, we hid the keg Lawler got
in the woods.

09:08.865 --> 09:10.940
We're totally gonna party
tonight.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.292
Gonna get so twisted.

09:12.444 --> 09:14.460
I'm gonna get twisted
and scrambled.

09:14.613 --> 09:16.462
How about you, Beef,
You gonna get warped?

09:16.615 --> 09:17.872
No. I am not.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.800
I plan to spend my free time
honing my survival skills.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.061
Whatever, Beef.
Have fun surviving.

09:23.288 --> 09:24.304
(laughter)

09:24.456 --> 09:25.972
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> Then Delmer walked over to Dad</i>

09:26.066 --> 09:28.124
<i>for what's called the "tickling</i>
<i> the baby" moment in the movie.</i>

09:28.217 --> 09:30.310
<i> It's when the hero does</i>
<i> something cool early on</i>

09:30.445 --> 09:31.903
<i> -to make you like them.</i>
-Hey, Beef,

09:32.055 --> 09:34.130
you got that friction fire going
nice and quick.

09:34.223 --> 09:35.799
So why the frown?

09:35.892 --> 09:37.317
It's just that I thought
all the other counselors here

09:37.411 --> 09:39.727
would be serious,
outdoor-minded people,

09:39.821 --> 09:41.638
not a bunch
of darn Silly Billies.

09:41.731 --> 09:43.973
Okay, Beef, first,
let's watch our language.

09:43.992 --> 09:46.400
Sorry, Delmer. Just because
I don't like to get warped

09:46.494 --> 09:49.236
or fizzled or zip-zapped,
I'm not cool?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.589
(groans)
It's frustrating.

09:50.816 --> 09:53.574
I know a lot of counselors here
are real Party Patricks,

09:53.594 --> 09:55.743
and you're more
of a fellow friend of nature.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.746
But I'm always happy to work on
survival skills with you, Beef.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.325
-Ah, that'd be great.
-Well, first thing is
my favorite knot.

10:02.344 --> 10:04.936
Watch me.
That's a quick release knot.

10:05.163 --> 10:08.014
Now, how about some advanced
pocketknife skills?

10:08.166 --> 10:10.834
One thing I like to do is open
all the little doodads on mine

10:10.927 --> 10:13.761
-and use it as a throwing star.
<i> -WOLF: Oh, and that's</i>

10:13.780 --> 10:16.615
one of those pieces of dialogue
you should pay attention to,

10:16.766 --> 10:20.343
because it'll probably
come back around later.

10:20.436 --> 10:22.011
Oop! Look what time it is.

10:22.030 --> 10:25.773
I think it's Rice Krispie Treat
o'clock down at the mess hall.

10:25.867 --> 10:27.608
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Then there was</i>
<i> one of those shots</i>

10:27.628 --> 10:29.519
<i> where you see them</i>
<i>walking away together all nice,</i>

10:29.612 --> 10:31.704
<i> but then some weird ominous</i>
<i>music starts to play like this:</i>

10:31.857 --> 10:34.190
<i> (wavering tones):</i>
♪<i> Ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.</i> ♪

10:34.209 --> 10:36.134
<i> And it's clear that the</i>
<i> nice part of the movie is over</i>

10:36.285 --> 10:37.969
<i> and it's about to get creepy.</i>

10:38.196 --> 10:40.955
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> That night the cool counselors</i>
<i> were partying in the woods.</i>

10:41.049 --> 10:42.307
(loud spitting)

10:42.458 --> 10:43.366
Gross!

10:43.385 --> 10:45.535
This beer tastes
like spicy beans!

10:45.553 --> 10:48.337
Oh, my God! What the hell
is all this chunky stuff

10:48.339 --> 10:50.315
-on the side of the keg?
-I don't know.

10:50.466 --> 10:51.875
I found the keg sitting
in the sun

10:51.893 --> 10:53.559
behind that abandoned
chili restaurant

10:53.654 --> 10:55.153
near the toxic waste dump
that's owned by that cult.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.638
Oh, Chaz's Killer Chili.
Love that place.

10:57.732 --> 10:59.899
Well, I'm definitely never
making out with you now.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.809
Unless I'm super bored.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.903
(scoffs)
Let's get out of here, Kinberly.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.498
I've got some Swatch watches
in my cabin I want to show you.

11:06.649 --> 11:09.058
Tubular. And I want to talk
about how much I love

11:09.077 --> 11:10.076
the Berlin Wall.

11:10.228 --> 11:11.670
Way to go, Lawler, you dingus.

11:11.821 --> 11:13.913
-You blew it!
<i> -WOLF: But that wasn't the end</i>

11:14.065 --> 11:16.733
<i> of the skunky chili beer keg.</i>
<i> Oh, no.</i>

11:16.751 --> 11:19.402
<i> Because one inquisitive little</i>
<i> ground squirrel came along</i>

11:19.495 --> 11:21.905
<i> and decided to take</i>
<i> a spicy bite.</i>

11:21.998 --> 11:23.406
<i> And then-- oh, no!</i>

11:23.499 --> 11:26.017
<i> The squirrel was trapped</i>
<i> in the toxic chili keg.</i>

11:26.169 --> 11:28.335
<i> And that chili wasn't</i>
<i> the only thing</i>

11:28.430 --> 11:30.430
<i> that was about to be killer.</i>

11:30.582 --> 11:31.931
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> This is when everyone</i>
<i> in the theater</i>

11:32.025 --> 11:33.858
<i> who has popcorn</i>
<i> in their lap jumps,</i>

11:34.085 --> 11:35.418
<i> and a little popcorn</i>
<i> goes flying.</i>

11:35.511 --> 11:37.570
And they say,
"Ah, dang, my popcorn!"

11:40.759 --> 11:43.017
And that's what it's like
to get a drive-on on the lot,

11:43.036 --> 11:44.369
according to the book
by the guys who wrote

11:44.520 --> 11:46.095
<i> Night at the Museum.</i>
Anyway...

11:46.114 --> 11:48.431
<i> the monster squirrel,</i>
<i> fueled by chili beer,</i>

11:48.450 --> 11:49.741
<i> set its sights on the camp.</i>

11:49.893 --> 11:52.043
Hello? Anyone there?

11:52.270 --> 11:53.436
Deppy?

11:53.455 --> 11:55.621
After all that chili talk,
I got a hankering.

11:55.774 --> 11:56.548
Aah!

11:56.775 --> 11:58.608
(chuckles nervously):
Okay.

11:58.626 --> 12:00.385
You got me. Very funny.

12:00.536 --> 12:02.962
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> As Lawler walks to check</i>
<i> the creaking door,</i>

12:03.056 --> 12:05.206
<i> we switch to the killer's POV,</i>

12:05.225 --> 12:08.284
<i> and we hear</i>
<i> its heavy murderer breath.</i>

12:08.377 --> 12:11.879
<i> -Like this...</i>
-(deep, heavy breathing)

12:11.898 --> 12:13.606
My chili!

12:15.235 --> 12:17.143
-(screams)
-(screeches)

12:17.237 --> 12:20.964
-No!
<i> -WOLF: He plunged</i>
<i> his giant squirrel teeth</i>

<i> -right into Lawler's neck!</i>
-Aah!

12:22.968 --> 12:25.410
<i> Ripped his head off and</i>
<i> shook it around a little bit.</i>

<i> (babbles)</i>
<i> Blood goes everywhere.</i>

12:28.323 --> 12:29.806
<i> Splat, splip, sploop.</i>

12:29.824 --> 12:32.976
<i> And now the monster</i>
<i> killer squirrel has a taste</i>

12:32.994 --> 12:37.647
<i> for skunky beer, killer chili,</i>
<i> and the blood of hunky teens.</i>

12:37.665 --> 12:39.406
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> But then it's a little later.</i>

12:39.426 --> 12:41.242
<i> Enter Beef.</i>
<i> And he's all like, "Uh-oh,"</i>

12:41.336 --> 12:42.819
<i> 'cause there's no Lawler,</i>

12:42.912 --> 12:45.655
<i> only his signature fanny pack</i>
<i> laying there all spooky.</i>

12:45.748 --> 12:48.082
-What the...?
-Let's get some eggs,
throw 'em at birds.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.101
They'll be like, "Whoa! Eggs!

12:50.328 --> 12:52.878
Usually these come
out of my butt! No way!"

12:52.939 --> 12:54.606
Guys, don't throw eggs.
It's wasteful.

12:54.833 --> 12:58.092
Says the guy who threw
strawberry jelly everywhere.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.278
-It's not jelly. It's blood.
-Gross!

13:00.429 --> 13:02.429
Ugh! Ever heard
of a Band-Aid, bro?

13:02.524 --> 13:04.674
Ugh. Listen, Lawler is missing,
which I've deduced

13:04.767 --> 13:07.268
because his fanny pack
is lying here without him.

13:07.362 --> 13:09.529
Let's wake Delmer.
He'll know what to do.

13:09.681 --> 13:11.681
No way.
Delmer's old, and that sucks.

13:11.699 --> 13:15.184
Let's go out on our own
with no adults at all.

13:15.278 --> 13:16.869
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> So they headed out</i>
<i> into the woods.</i>

13:16.963 --> 13:18.296
Lawler, where are you?

13:18.447 --> 13:20.298
We have your fanny pack, bro!

13:20.449 --> 13:22.300
Lawler! You left all your blood
in the kitchen!

13:22.527 --> 13:24.377
Quiet.
We don't know what's out here.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.713
Oh, quiet like this?
(imitates fart)

13:27.866 --> 13:28.865
(screams)

13:28.883 --> 13:30.457
Oh, great.
Where did Kinberly go?

13:30.552 --> 13:32.218
We were supposed
to make out later.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.554
BEEF:
Paw prints. We're being hunted.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.130
Let's all go back-to-back
and stick together.

13:36.224 --> 13:39.042
Or, better idea, let's split up.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.134
Mm, definitely not.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.377
And... split!

13:41.396 --> 13:43.229
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> And they split up,</i>

<i> just like dummies always do</i>

<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> Yeah. So obviously</i>
<i> the squirrel gets Duke,</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:48.718
<i> because he wasn't</i>
<i> a main character</i>

14:09.999 --> 14:11.257
Thanks, Grandpa.

14:11.409 --> 14:12.333
Sorry,
I know that sounded sarcastic,

14:12.352 --> 14:13.834

-Beef!
-There's a monster out here.

14:17.432 --> 14:19.916
-What should we do?
-Well, hmm.

14:19.934 --> 14:23.177
How did a ground squirrel mutate
into a giant monster?

14:23.271 --> 14:25.846
Could it have encountered
a toxic substance?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.256
Uh, well, we did leave

14:27.275 --> 14:29.183
a skunky killer chili beer keg
in the woods.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.201
It's not a huge whoop.

14:30.428 --> 14:31.944
It actually is a huge whoop.

14:32.097 --> 14:33.262
Littering hurts everyone.

14:33.281 --> 14:35.039
If it's chili that's made him,

it's only chili
that can destroy him.

Hmm. What am I missing?

This squirrel doesn't just want

(screeches)

15:48.339 --> 15:49.689
You just got Deppy'd!

15:49.783 --> 15:51.432
-Deppy, you didn't do anything.
-See, Beef?

15:51.526 --> 15:53.117
Everyone thought
you weren't cool,

15:53.269 --> 15:54.935
but you did
the coolest thing of all--

15:54.955 --> 15:56.512
save everybody's lives.

15:56.531 --> 15:58.272
<i> WOLF: Then it freeze-frames</i>
<i> on them high-fiving</i>

15:58.366 --> 16:00.016
<i> in the air,</i>
<i> and that was the end.</i>

16:00.034 --> 16:01.167
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Uh-oh.</i>

16:01.277 --> 16:02.518
Speaking of movies,
we might need

16:02.537 --> 16:04.278
to<i> Weekend at Bernie's</i>
this bad boy.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.356
-Ah.
-Oh, did I save the town again
with pee?

16:07.375 --> 16:10.209
Better.
With your brain pee: knowledge.

16:10.361 --> 16:12.119
Hey, bud.
Just 30 minutes to go,

16:12.213 --> 16:14.380
and then you can go
to Sleep City.

16:14.532 --> 16:15.364
Dad, do a story.

16:15.383 --> 16:16.474
Okay, um...

16:16.625 --> 16:18.643
Ooh, how about Delmer
and the Sea Monster?

16:18.794 --> 16:21.462
-Eh...
-Sure, if you want him
to fall asleep and die.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.148
Yeah, that one is boring,
and if I remember correctly,

16:24.300 --> 16:26.651
half that story is lists
of outdated maritime laws.

16:26.802 --> 16:29.378
Uh, I think everyone loves
my maritime law talk.

16:29.397 --> 16:31.547
Dad, I mean this
with love and respect:

16:31.640 --> 16:33.899
I absolutely hate
your maritime law talk.

16:34.052 --> 16:35.401
Maybe For Delmer's life's sake

16:35.495 --> 16:37.887
you could at least let the
sea monster have a fun voice.

16:37.905 --> 16:38.979
Maybe it...

16:38.999 --> 16:40.481
(high-pitched)
sounds like this.

16:40.575 --> 16:41.648
I will consider it.

16:41.743 --> 16:43.409
It all started
at The Russian Restaurant.

16:43.561 --> 16:47.063
<i> I had just learned</i>
<i> that my dear Kathleen</i>

16:47.156 --> 16:48.339
<i> was pregnant</i>
<i> with our first child.</i>

16:48.566 --> 16:51.067
<i> I was terrified,</i>
<i>so Delmer and I decided to have</i>

16:51.160 --> 16:52.659
<i> what we called a "rager."</i>

16:52.679 --> 16:55.087
<i> Some lunch and a quiet day</i>
<i> of fishing and contemplations.</i>

16:55.240 --> 16:57.515
<i> We were finishing up</i>
<i> our sandwiches when...</i>

16:57.742 --> 16:58.908
Whoops.
(chuckles)

16:58.926 --> 17:00.259
Spilled some mustard
on my shirt.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.927
Look at me,
Mr. Mustard over here.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.096
I'll go to the bathroom
and clean this stain

17:04.249 --> 17:05.839
with some cool water
because, as we all know,

17:05.933 --> 17:08.675
-if you use warm water,
it actually sets it.
<i> -JUDY: Dad!</i>

17:08.770 --> 17:11.254
You've been talking
about mustard for five minutes.

17:11.347 --> 17:12.588
-Be exciting.
-Okay. Got it.

17:12.681 --> 17:15.682
-So the mustard stain came out.
-Dad, no.

17:15.777 --> 17:18.928
But more importantly, there was
a salty old sea captain

17:18.946 --> 17:20.354
holding court in the pub.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.766
And there she was,
clear as me hand before me now,

17:23.859 --> 17:25.434
the Sea Monster of Lone Moose.

17:25.528 --> 17:27.620
She was ten stories tall
if she were an inch,

17:27.714 --> 17:30.697
with a long, spiky tail so sharp
it'd surely cut through you

17:30.717 --> 17:32.383
like a hot knife
through blubber!

17:32.610 --> 17:33.217
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> Okay,</i>

17:33.444 --> 17:35.386
this sounds like the 1880s.

17:35.572 --> 17:38.114
Oh, please. I allowed you
your historical inaccuracies,

17:38.132 --> 17:39.615
you can allow me mine.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.967
<i> So, putting no stock</i>
<i> in the sea monster yarn,</i>

17:42.120 --> 17:44.136
<i> and with Delmer by my side,</i>
<i> I journeyed out</i>

17:44.230 --> 17:45.897
<i> into uncharted waters.</i>

17:46.048 --> 17:48.524
<i> Ship wreckage.</i>

17:49.627 --> 17:51.310
-Aah!
-Aah! Monster!

17:51.462 --> 17:53.071
This is
an active shipwreck site!

17:53.222 --> 17:54.980
Your interference violates
the following

17:55.133 --> 17:57.533
-eight maritime laws. First...
-Dad!
-No!

18:01.989 --> 18:03.915
(screaming)

18:04.142 --> 18:05.399
I'll ready the harpoon gun!

18:05.418 --> 18:07.401
Say your prayers, water demon!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.403
Beef, stop.
It's not trying to hurt us.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.406
It's trying to get to its child.
Look over there.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.835
It's just being protective,
like I was of my kids,

18:15.929 --> 18:18.078
and like you will be
when you're a parent.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.655
Gooblah. Gerblaw.

18:19.748 --> 18:20.932
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> No, like this.</i>

18:21.159 --> 18:22.767
<i> (high-pitched):</i>
<i> Gooblah. Gerblaw.</i>

18:22.994 --> 18:27.087
Oh. The mom is upset because
it's separated from its baby.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.347
That's not its mom.

18:28.499 --> 18:31.033
That's its dad. Look below deck.

18:31.093 --> 18:34.186
Oh, yeah.
Wow, that's a weird penis.

18:34.339 --> 18:36.689
Beef, we don't need to kill
the sea monster.

18:36.841 --> 18:39.675
We just need to get it
back together with its baby.

18:39.768 --> 18:43.012
This sea monster is all this
baby has, just like you'll be

18:43.030 --> 18:44.789
all your baby has.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.866
Me? What about Kathleen?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.292
Eh. Don't get me wrong, Beef,

18:48.444 --> 18:51.370
she made for a great
Wine Cooler Queen of Ketchikan,

18:51.522 --> 18:54.523
but she's just not
a Reliable Ricky like you.

18:54.542 --> 18:57.784
I've known you your whole life.
You're going to be a great dad.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.028
(gasping)

18:59.046 --> 19:00.471
This is a great talk, Delmer,

19:00.698 --> 19:04.267
-but I should probably steer
the boat out of the way.
-Yup.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.873
-(cheering)
<i> -BEEF: And the dad</i>

19:10.892 --> 19:14.318
<i> and the baby sea monster</i>
<i> were reunited, and...</i>

19:14.545 --> 19:16.228
Dad, this is very touching,
but look at Delmer.

19:16.381 --> 19:19.548
Uh, three more minutes.
Then there was lightning!

19:19.567 --> 19:21.717
And thunder!
And thunder sounds!

19:21.736 --> 19:22.809
Thunder sounds!

19:22.829 --> 19:24.495
Oh, my! Thunder sounds?

19:24.722 --> 19:27.907
-(thunder crashing)
-The engine cut out!
We're stuck!

19:28.059 --> 19:29.074
(both scream)

19:29.169 --> 19:31.002
DELMER:
The boat's on fire!

19:32.079 --> 19:33.654
Shall we prepare to die?

19:33.673 --> 19:34.730
Couldn't hurt.

19:35.917 --> 19:40.011
<i> BEEF: But suddenly the boat</i>
<i>started to move out of the storm</i>

19:40.162 --> 19:43.163
<i> and towards the shore.</i>

19:43.183 --> 19:45.183
-Gerblaw!
<i> -And in the end,</i>

19:45.334 --> 19:48.093
because we had helped the dad,
he helped us.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.170
Just a couple of dads
helping dads.

19:50.264 --> 19:51.931
Isn't that right, Delmer?

19:52.083 --> 19:53.340
(snoring)

19:53.359 --> 19:54.417
-Delms!
-Don't worry,

19:54.435 --> 19:56.101
we're past the four-hour mark.

19:56.196 --> 19:59.271
-We did it.
-Look at him all peaceful,
catching some Zs.

19:59.424 --> 20:01.199
Or should I say
catching some Ds?

20:01.426 --> 20:03.034
-'Cause he's Delmer.
-Wolf, no...

20:03.185 --> 20:05.594
Don't say "catching some Ds."

20:06.431 --> 20:08.206
<i> DELMER:</i>
<i>Hey, Beef, thanks for telling me</i>

20:08.433 --> 20:10.208
those nice stories
to keep me up last night.

20:10.435 --> 20:13.193
Yeah, it was interesting
to revisit the memories

20:13.213 --> 20:14.712
of what those stories
were based on.

20:14.863 --> 20:17.531
Like when me and Brian came
to live with you for a while

20:17.550 --> 20:20.125
because our parents joined
that space cult.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.794
What a couple of knuckleheads.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.870
And when I worked
at your summer camp

20:23.965 --> 20:25.539
because my parents
were "unavailable"

20:25.558 --> 20:27.874
due to their involvement
in the conspiracy

20:27.894 --> 20:29.376
to poison the mayor.

20:29.545 --> 20:33.046
And when Kathleen got pregnant,
you did take me out fishing.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.807
You were pretty nervous.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.292
But you calmed me down.

20:36.385 --> 20:38.477
Delmer, you were my parent
when I needed one.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.405
And for that,
I will always be thankful.

20:41.632 --> 20:43.799
Well, Beef, my boy,

20:43.818 --> 20:46.452
I love...
(snoring)

20:48.973 --> 20:51.290
(clicking)

20:54.495 --> 20:55.253
(continues snoring)

20:55.404 --> 20:57.646
-(farts)
-Dear Lord, Delmer.

20:57.665 --> 20:59.090
(chuckles)
