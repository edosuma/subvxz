WEBVTT

00:31.698 --> 00:33.658
Now I'm not gonna mention any names,

00:33.742 --> 00:36.953
but due to last year's
unfortunate kissing incident,

00:37.037 --> 00:40.165
mistletoe is banned
from this year's Christmas party.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.251
Peppermint Schnapps makes me sloppy.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.295
Enough with your party, Hank.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.089
Help me figure out
what to get Nancy for Christmas.

00:48.339 --> 00:51.718
I'll never top that oil painting
I commissioned last year.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.137
"Nude Dale In Repose."

00:54.220 --> 00:56.389
Tasteful, yet you can see everything.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.558


00:58.641 --> 01:00.560


01:02.812 --> 01:03.855
Here we are, lady.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.565
123 Rainey Street.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.032
Well, thank you, young man.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.242
This is it.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.328
That's her, all right.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.829
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.583
My name is Hank Hill and I own this house.
Is there something I can help you with?

01:23.666 --> 01:29.339
I'm Ruby Wakefield and I used to live here
many years ago with my twin sister.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.424
My word.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.593
Look how big that tree has grown.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.471
I planted that thing
when it was a sapling.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.849
I give that tree a deep root feeding
twice a year.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.726
Hank, I got your antlers.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.730
Well, that's my family.
We're gonna go harvest a Christmas tree.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.440
They look lovely.

01:47.899 --> 01:51.486
I appreciate your taking
such good care of this house.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.488
It means a lot to me.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.699


01:57.534 --> 01:58.993
Hey, Ms. Wakefield,

01:59.160 --> 02:01.955
if you're in town tomorrow,
why don't you come back for dinner?

02:02.038 --> 02:04.040
I'll give you the indoor tour.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.252
The kitchen sink now
has a garbage disposal.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.462
I'd like that, Mr. Hill.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.216
So, she's a twin?

02:16.386 --> 02:20.098
I still cannot believe you invited
that old woman over for dinner, Hank.

02:20.181 --> 02:23.184
That's like putting out a saucer of milk
for a stray cat.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.311
One lap, you'll never get rid of her.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.065
All she wants to do
is take a walk down memory lane.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.735
Besides, most seniors
are lactose intolerant.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.739
Keep going, Bobby, you're almost there.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.075
I like old people
as much as anybody should,

02:39.159 --> 02:40.910
but you've got to be careful.

02:42.745 --> 02:43.997
Good work, Bobby.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.211
Listen to that baby hum.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.383
I remember dropping
a friendship ring down this drain.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.386
Practically broke off my fingernail
getting it back.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.514
I know how that feels, Ms. Wakefield.

03:01.598 --> 03:05.101
One time, the front door
bent my pinkie toe backwards.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.604
The nail grew back really gross.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.230
Leave your shoe on, Bobby.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.232
Believe it or not,

03:11.316 --> 03:14.944
but that is a memory
that you'll cherish someday, Bobby.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.822
So save up as many as you can

03:17.906 --> 03:19.699
because when you're old like me,

03:19.782 --> 03:23.786
you'll have riches
beyond all the gold in the world.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.581
Oh, darn.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.625
I cannot believe we're out of coffee.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.669
Oh, well, it's getting close
to bed time anyway, huh?

03:33.338 --> 03:36.049
Oh, you have such wonderful memories.

03:36.132 --> 03:41.095
Now I can't wait to get old and wrinkly,
and grow a little hump on my back.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.264
You're so sweet, dear.

03:43.348 --> 03:48.478
Mrs. Hill, it amazes me how much
you remind me of my sister.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.439
So smart and pretty.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.983
Well, thank you.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.238
Oh, lookie here, a new can of coffee.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.822
I'll just brew some up.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.533
Oh, coffee sounds nice, dear.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.702
I got it.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.038
What if I seal myself in a crate

04:07.121 --> 04:10.083
and have me delivered
on Christmas day to Nancy?

04:10.166 --> 04:12.252
Wait, do they have mail on Christmas?

04:12.335 --> 04:15.505
It wouldn't be very merry
if I died in some distribution center.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.675
Why don't you just take Nancy
to a countryside bed and breakfast

04:18.758 --> 04:20.718
for a lovely nice romantic weekend?

04:20.802 --> 04:23.680
Nah, I'm not the kind of person
who pays someone 100 bucks

04:23.763 --> 04:25.390
to sleep in their dirty sheets.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.810
I'm the kind of person
who charges other people

04:28.893 --> 04:30.728
to sleep in my dirty sheets.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.688
That's it.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.232
I'll turn our house
into a bed and breakfast.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.733
All you need is some potpourri

04:35.817 --> 04:38.319
and a few boxes of waffles
and you're in business.

04:39.112 --> 04:39.988
Mm.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.699
Don't you nay-say me, Boomhauer.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.325
Once I find the right hook,

04:44.409 --> 04:47.370
this is gonna be the gift
that keeps on giving.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.000
Say nay now, naysayer.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.626
Mm.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.672
What a handsome family you are.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.632
How very observant of you.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.884
This is my room.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.970
It's chock full of memories for me.

05:04.053 --> 05:08.558
Ooh, like the time I dressed
our dog, Ladybird, in my underwear

05:08.641 --> 05:11.811
and pretended that
we were Calvin Klein models.

05:13.354 --> 05:17.025
This is also where I read my Bible
every night before bed.

05:17.108 --> 05:20.862
Yes, this room certainly
brings back many memories.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.489
This is where my sister died.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.033
-Ew.
-Good Lord.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.410
Your sister died in my room?

05:27.493 --> 05:32.040
Well, actually, she just had
a massive heart attack in here.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.168
Somehow she managed to crawl
down the hallway

05:35.251 --> 05:37.795
to about right over there...

05:37.879 --> 05:41.632
I don't know how she dragged herself
with her arthritic fingers.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.676
She couldn't even open a jar
of apple butter.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.512
Oh, you have to forgive me,

05:46.596 --> 05:49.807
but I think I need to sit
for a moment and rest.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.355
She's been asleep for over an hour.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.690
I guess I'd better wake her up
and send her on her way.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.986
Ms. Wakefield. Ms. Wakefield.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.863
-Ms. Wake...
-Hey.

06:03.946 --> 06:04.906
What's going on?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.617
Oh, I'm still here.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.870
Yeah, you dozed off for a bit,
and it's getting kinda late.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.872
I'm sure you're ready to head on home.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.792
Yes, I am. I am ready.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.464
Ms. Wakefield, are you okay?

06:21.547 --> 06:22.632
Huh?

06:22.715 --> 06:24.634
Oh, oh, uh...

06:26.094 --> 06:30.098
The happiest times of my life
were spent here in this house.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.935
That's why there is no place else
in the world

06:34.018 --> 06:36.270
that I would rather end my days.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.730
End your days?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.233
Yes. I want to die here.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.861
I promise not to be a nuisance.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.371
Ms. Wakefield, you can't die in my house.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.623
You're really not being a good guest...

06:55.706 --> 06:56.707
ma'am.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.917
I called you a taxi.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.420
It's the least we can do,
but all we're gonna do.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.923
But it's important to me to die
where I was happiest.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.883
Don't you want me to be happy?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.218
Not that way.

07:07.301 --> 07:10.346
Okay, I guess it's your house.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.223
I'll just get my shawl.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.688
Oh, great, she went behind the tree.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.815
Oh. We don't decorate back there.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.567
Ms. Wakefield, please...

07:22.650 --> 07:24.444
I promise not to drag this out.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.654
I bet it won't take me more than two days.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.947
At most, three.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.073
You keep her busy.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.368
I'll sneak up from behind
and poke her with this driver.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.078
You got me that driver I wanted?

07:34.787 --> 07:37.457
-She's headed for the bathroom.
-Dang it.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.208
Hey, I'm in here.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.669
-Ms. Wakefield, you need to leave.
-Oh.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.588
Hank, the taxi's here.

07:43.880 --> 07:48.342
I cannot believe it's this hard
to think of a bed and breakfast theme.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.345
How about an Evening at the Improv?

07:51.429 --> 07:52.472
Great idea.

07:54.932 --> 07:57.477
I know... crap idea.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.438
Dang it, Boomhauer, aren't you ever wrong?

08:00.521 --> 08:01.689
Please,

08:01.772 --> 08:03.024
don't make me leave.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.109
I promise I won't be any trouble.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.405
Stop pinching me, Ms. Wakefield.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.408
Ah, finally.
Hank come to his senses and...

08:12.492 --> 08:14.076
Wait a minute, that not Peggy.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.329
Why you picking on that old lady, Sug?

08:16.412 --> 08:19.499
I'm not picking on her.
She wants to die in my house.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.460
Please, show some compassion.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.262
I, uh... She...

08:38.893 --> 08:41.729
We ate, we laughed, we had some coffee...

08:41.812 --> 08:44.273
then she told us she wanted
to die in my house

08:44.357 --> 08:46.609
and ruined the whole got-dang evening.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.778
So, basically, this woman told you

08:48.861 --> 08:51.572
that she wanted to die in your house,
no strings attached?

08:51.656 --> 08:52.657
Yep.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.824
I've got it.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.536
The theme is a haunted bed and breakfast.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.579
Hauntings are all the rage now.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.165
Haunted hotel rooms, haunted cruises.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.627
If I can get that crone
to agree to die in my house

09:04.710 --> 09:07.338
and haunt the place,
we'd be booked year round.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.216
What do you say now, Boomhauer?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.384
Mm.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.178
What in the heck
are you talking about, Dale?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.430
Nancy's Christmas present.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.183
Please, Hank,
let Ms. Wakefield die in my house.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.102
Please, please, please...

09:21.185 --> 09:22.937
Has everyone gone crazy?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.897
It's Christmas for God's sake.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.526
No one is dying in my house
or your house, Dale.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.780
I'll probably die in my house.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.534
Wedged behind the bathroom door.
Inaccessible to the paramedics.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.661
Well, what can you do?

09:42.331 --> 09:46.294
I can't believe that I'm feeling guilty
about denying Ms. Wakefield's...

09:46.919 --> 09:47.878
request.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.547
Well, what does she expect us to do?

09:49.630 --> 09:54.552
Bobby, I don't know how a giraffe
got in the nativity scene, but I like it.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.304
Let's go find a zebra.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.102
Ms. Wakefield, what are you doing here?

10:03.185 --> 10:07.273
I just wanted to apologize
for causing such a scene the other night.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.191
I hope you're not angry with me.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.614
Merry Christmas, Mr. Hill.

10:15.531 --> 10:18.909
Oh, well, Merry Christmas
to you too, Ms. Wakefield.

10:19.327 --> 10:23.539
I drank a lot of iced tea earlier.
Could I use your bathroom?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.375
Oh, sure thing.
It's right down the hall on the...

10:26.792 --> 10:29.211
Wait a minute.
I know what you're trying to do.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.715
You don't need to use the bathroom.
You just want to die in there, don't you?

10:34.717 --> 10:36.510
I promise I won't take long.

10:42.308 --> 10:46.854
If I hold my breath for ten seconds,
I bet I'll slip away just like that.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.448
I have a proposition for you.

10:58.783 --> 11:02.370
And a plate of pitted prunes.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.624
Why die here, you ask?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.918
Well, you'd be getting in
on the ground floor

11:09.001 --> 11:11.045
of a wonderful investment opportunity,

11:11.128 --> 11:14.173
and all you really have to do
is make two appearances a day

11:14.256 --> 11:17.635
from the afterlife,
via this old antique mirror.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.388
It's not hard work,
but I do expect quality.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.847
Are there any questions?

11:22.807 --> 11:24.016
Can I go now?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.686
What, so you can go die
over at Hank's house?

11:28.312 --> 11:31.482
I could get you a dead little lapdog
to keep you company.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.199
That shuffle alone would pack the place.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.869
I still don't see why I can't come
to the mall with you guys.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.871
Because we're shopping for you.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.332
-And you peek.
-Your mother's right.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.167
Besides somebody should stay here.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.421
You know, in case an old lady tries to...

11:53.504 --> 11:55.381
Bobby, just keep the doors locked.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.680
Dooley's gonna pants Santa?
Dang, I can't go.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.224
Make sure the elves
take plenty of pictures.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.270
Let me in, Bobby.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.188
I have a peppermint.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.152
How could you there?
It's Christmas...

12:16.777 --> 12:20.448
It's reasonable not to want someone
to die in your house, right?

12:20.531 --> 12:22.366
Mm-hmm. We cannot open that door.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.910
-I mean, if Bill gets wind...
-Hank.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.412
I understand an elder wishes

12:26.495 --> 12:28.664
to use your home
as an entrance to the spirit world.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.709
My people teach that
a person must be happy at death

12:31.792 --> 12:34.628
or they are destined to walk
throughout eternity on their hands

12:34.712 --> 12:37.214
so their frown appears to be a smile.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.384
Food for thought.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.554
Hank Hill.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.306
<i>She's on the roof!</i>

12:56.108 --> 12:58.652
Ms. Wakefield shoved her arm
through the mail slot

12:58.736 --> 13:00.321
and tried to unlock the door.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.823
She's been scratching at all the windows.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.410
Ms. Wakefield, show yourself.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.620
Ms. Wakefield.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.167
Dang it, Ms. Wakefield,
I have had it with you.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.711
You've got my boy hiding under the tree.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.755
You got all my friends mad at me.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.382
I'm sorry, you've left me no choice.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.427
<i>Sixty-four to four-forty-three.</i>

13:23.803 --> 13:26.180
Thank you for being so prompt, officers.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.307
There's the trespasser I called about.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.059
Her?

13:30.142 --> 13:32.436
You want us to arrest that poor old woman?

13:35.397 --> 13:39.318
Hank had to call Johnny Law
on big, bad, old lady with walker.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.780
I don't want them to arrest her,
I just want them to take her away

13:42.863 --> 13:45.324
so I can get on with Christmas
and whatnot.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.618
Well, maybe you could compromise with her.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.162
Compromise? How do I do that?

13:50.246 --> 13:51.997
Let her die on my sidewalk?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.040
I'm just saying.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.834
You're not saying anything.

13:54.917 --> 13:55.793
Still.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.504
If she were trying to break
into your homes and die,

13:58.587 --> 14:00.714
you'd do the same thing, I tell you what.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.466
What have I done wrong?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.343
Absolutely nothing.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.278
Peggy's making her special Christmas fudge
for the party tomorrow.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.656
Yep, it sure is gonna to be a good time.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.950
Yeah, until you call the cops on us.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.494
That poor old woman.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.831
She committed the crime
of loving Hank's house too much.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.208
Are we not all guilty?

14:37.167 --> 14:40.045
Hank, I do not want you to blame yourself,

14:40.129 --> 14:42.590
but Ms. Wakefield died at a bus station

14:42.673 --> 14:45.384
the very night you had her arrested
and dragged away.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.427
What?

14:46.927 --> 14:50.264
Good Lord, she was a retired
Sunday school teacher.

14:50.347 --> 14:53.350
Now, Hank, I don't want you
to dwell on the awful things

14:53.434 --> 14:54.768
you said to her out of anger.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.994
I can't believe she's really gone.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.829
It just seems like yesterday

15:13.913 --> 15:16.749
she was trying to get her walker
through the doggie door.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.542
I wish she were here

15:18.626 --> 15:21.587
so I could give her little hump a big hug.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.923
Are we still gonna have our party tonight?

15:24.256 --> 15:25.966
It just doesn't feel right.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.635
Oh, don't be silly, Bobby.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.220
Ms. Wakefield
would have wanted it that way.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.932
She probably loved parties.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.851
Now come on, let's get back
in the Christmas spirit.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.605
Why don't we pick up a little green vest
for Ladybird to wear at the party?

15:39.688 --> 15:40.981
That'll cheer everyone up.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.110
I hope this fits.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.197
Pet Town doesn't have
a very generous return policy.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.908
I still don't understand
why a vest is cool

15:50.991 --> 15:53.160
yet a Santa hat would be demeaning.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.912
If I have to explain it...

16:00.501 --> 16:01.752
Ms. Wakefield.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.803
So, Ms. Wakefield isn't dead?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.639
Oh, my God, she's somewhere in the house.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.183
Oh, Lord, I hope she isn't dead.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.351
Run!

16:17.434 --> 16:18.852
No, we've got to find her.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.063
Bobby, you and Luanne check the den.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.983
Peggy, you check the garage,
and I'll check the back of the house.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.651
If any of you find her, holler out.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.461
Oh, God!

16:44.545 --> 16:46.005
Oh, Ladybird.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.423
Dumb dog, dumb.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.508
You almost got your bell rung.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.969
Wait a minute...

16:53.595 --> 16:55.848
There you go, girl. Come on.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.976
Get Ms. Wakefield's scent
and track down that old coot.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.061
Good girl. Come on, for Mama.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.896
No, no, Ladybird.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.107
No. No fetch. Find old lady.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.109
Sniff and fi... Oh.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.819
Dumb dog.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.655
Ms. Wakefield,

17:12.281 --> 17:14.992
if you're under here,
please don't grab me by the throat

17:15.075 --> 17:16.910
and drag me into the gates of hell.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.042
Don't tell Dad.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.879
Ms. Wakefield, are you in here?

17:27.337 --> 17:31.091
I know we haven't been on the same page
about your dying and all,

17:31.175 --> 17:34.219
but I hope we can work out
our differences.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.559
Peppermint.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.076
Oh, Ms. Wakefield, why?

17:58.535 --> 18:00.579
Give me peace.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.831
Why can't you just let me be?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.334
Ms. Wakefield, we thought you were dead.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.086
We read your obituary.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.253
I was desperate.

18:08.337 --> 18:11.590
So I submitted a fake obituary
to get your guard down.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.634
You lied.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.719
Good Lord, the party.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.013
Peggy, Bobby, Luanne,
you take care of the guests

18:18.097 --> 18:20.432
while I escort Ms. Wakefield
out the back door.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.018
I'll join you in a minute.

18:24.019 --> 18:28.190
Our Christmas has been disrupted by you
for the last time, Ms. Wakefield.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.983
Well, if you would
just let me concentrate,

18:30.067 --> 18:31.527
I'd be out of your hair forever.

18:34.071 --> 18:37.199

Merry Christmas, John Redcorn.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.543
I made you some special
reindeer-shaped cookies

18:47.626 --> 18:49.962
with toothpicks sticking in them
like little arrows.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.296
Quite honestly, Peggy,

18:51.380 --> 18:52.965
I was going to boycott your party

18:53.048 --> 18:55.551
to protest Hank's harsh treatment
towards our elders,

18:55.634 --> 18:57.970
but I found out that
Bill is my secret Santa,

18:58.053 --> 18:59.721
and he always gives cool gifts.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.723
Yeah, Bill really go all out.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.351
Put me down.

19:04.434 --> 19:08.021
My God, Hank is wrestling
with Ms. Wakefield's ghost.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.606
What a waste.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.400
She's not dead.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.110
She's very much alive.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.904
She falsified her obituary
and broke in here.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.823
Please just continue with the party.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.950
I'll call her a taxi
and join you in a minute.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.577
But I don't want to go.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.287
Let her be, Hank.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.747
Yeah, man. It's, like,
dang ol' Christmas, man.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.291
-Come on, Hank.
-Oh, Hank.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.584
Where is holiday spirit?

19:31.503 --> 19:32.671
All right, fine.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.673
If that's how everyone feels.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.637
Ms. Wakefield,
if you want to die in my house,

19:40.721 --> 19:42.139
then go ahead.

19:43.724 --> 19:44.892
Really?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.145
Merry Christmas.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.856
Why... why thank you.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.693
Wait, you're not just teasing me, are you?

19:54.776 --> 19:55.986
No, ma'am.

19:56.069 --> 19:59.698

20:18.550 --> 20:22.846
You know, maybe it is
a little inappropriate right now.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.849
I mean, it is a Christmas party.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.684
Yeah, I see what you mean.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.811
Maybe I could die another time.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.813
When you're not entertaining.

20:31.897 --> 20:35.817
Sure. But you know, Ms. Wakefield,
you don't have to come back to die.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.402
You could come back just to visit.

20:37.653 --> 20:41.114
Maybe join us for a cookout
or sit under the tree you planted.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.576
That would be nice.

20:45.994 --> 20:50.499
Well, I've been enough of a bother.
I'll get out of your hair.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.460
Well, don't rush off.
Why don't you stay for secret Santa?

20:53.543 --> 20:56.838
I always get an extra gift
in case my boss stops by.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.137
Okay, here's one for Bill.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.891
Could this be that ear-and-nose trimmer
he's been needing?

21:08.433 --> 21:09.810
I hope it's hungry.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.937
All right, here's one for Peggy.
