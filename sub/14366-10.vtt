WEBVTT

00:08.157 --> 00:11.693
Simply put, this
combination of elements could allow us

00:11.695 --> 00:14.296
to cyberform entire worlds.

00:15.204 --> 00:18.460
Why do I feel a
Shockwave plan coming on?

00:19.840 --> 00:22.670
Do not think for a moment,
Starscream, that it has gone

00:22.673 --> 00:25.440
unnoticed that you left me
at the mercy of the Autobots.

00:25.442 --> 00:30.512
Master? Are you going to allow
one Lieutenant to harm another?

00:33.249 --> 00:36.952
- Master?
- I'm thinking.

00:40.324 --> 00:45.260
I am tempted to force you to
share my perception of things.

00:45.262 --> 00:50.732
No! I only did what I thought
was best for the mission,

00:50.734 --> 00:54.770
but I do feel compelled to
add that it was my very error

00:54.772 --> 00:58.507
in judgment that made this
happy accident possible!

01:00.577 --> 01:04.745
If I recollect, you were
seeking to purge your laboratory

01:04.748 --> 01:07.482
of sensitive materials
before the Autobots arrived,

01:07.484 --> 01:09.284
were you not?

01:09.286 --> 01:13.012
Your argument... is logical.

01:17.261 --> 01:20.862
Exemplary teamwork.
Now tell me, Shockwave,

01:20.864 --> 01:24.800
why does this cyber-matter
resemble chaos?

01:24.802 --> 01:28.270
The basic elements are
apparently unstable...

01:28.272 --> 01:30.772
I will turn my attention
to correcting that.

01:32.576 --> 01:36.712
Nevertheless, should we use
this cyber-matter to restore

01:36.714 --> 01:39.581
Cybertron, or cyberform Earth,

01:39.583 --> 01:43.418
we would require a launch
mechanism, would we not?

01:43.420 --> 01:47.923
<i>Then we will focus
all our remaining resources</i>

01:47.925 --> 01:52.527
<i>upon the successful reconstruction
of the Omega lock.</i>

02:52.330 --> 02:56.300
I've done everything I can,
considering the limitations

02:56.300 --> 03:00.940
of my equipment, and less
than ideal spare parts.

03:00.940 --> 03:04.010
It remains uncertain if
Ultra Magnus's new appendage

03:04.010 --> 03:07.950
will be fit for battle... though
it should prove functional,

03:07.950 --> 03:10.680
after the requisite amount of therapy.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.790
That is all we can hope for, old friend.

03:15.460 --> 03:19.020
- You doing okay?
- I'm still two-fisted.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.860
So's Magnus.

03:20.860 --> 03:24.700
Wait and see, the claw's
gonna become his signature...

03:24.700 --> 03:26.870
you know, like the way
you own that voice box

03:26.870 --> 03:28.170
Ratchet slapped in your throat!

03:30.340 --> 03:32.910
I mean, you know, everyone
understands you fine!

03:32.910 --> 03:36.880
Why would you even consider
getting it fixed now, am I right?

03:42.050 --> 03:44.050
Whoa, what'd he say?

03:44.050 --> 03:47.090
Bee's kind of still attached
to the sound of his own voice...

03:47.090 --> 03:51.220
- his original one.
- Hey, look at the bright, shiny side,

03:51.230 --> 03:53.390
Commander Magnus and
'Jackie single-handedly

03:53.390 --> 03:55.730
put the kibosh on project Predacon.

03:55.730 --> 03:59.800
Though at least one beast
that we know of remains...

03:59.800 --> 04:04.940
the one who has demonstrated
the ability to transform.

04:07.010 --> 04:11.480
Predaking, we will soon plot
our strike against the Autobots,

04:11.480 --> 04:14.850
to punish them for the
massacre of your kind.

04:14.850 --> 04:18.180
While I fully intend
to exact my revenge,

04:18.190 --> 04:23.390
project Predacon was merely
a squadron, not an army.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.010
I see...

04:25.560 --> 04:30.050
My liege, if you truly aspire
to restore our home world,

04:30.050 --> 04:34.080
then I have every faith that
you will resurrect the entirety

04:34.090 --> 04:37.890
of the Predacon race from
the remains which lie there,

04:37.890 --> 04:42.830
<i>so that I may lead them against any
and all of our shared enemies.</i>

04:47.400 --> 04:50.700
<i> We salvaged much of
the wreckage of the Omega lock,</i>

04:50.700 --> 04:52.970
but the damage was quite severe.

04:52.970 --> 04:55.370
I would urge the selective
use of Earth technology,

04:55.370 --> 04:57.770
retro-fitting its operating systems

04:57.780 --> 05:00.040
will be more efficient than
rebuilding from scratch.

05:00.040 --> 05:03.750
Then do provide Starscream
with your wish list.

05:03.750 --> 05:07.380
Since Shockwave must turn his
attention to the stabilization

05:07.390 --> 05:12.820
of our cyber-matter, you will
be in charge of acquisitions.

05:17.230 --> 05:20.330
<i>Prime!
We have trouble brewing.</i>

05:20.330 --> 05:24.030
The 'Cons staged a smash-and-grab
at the Los Alamos nuclear plant

05:24.040 --> 05:27.340
late last night, and made off
with 20 tons of control rods.

05:27.340 --> 05:32.410
What are the Decepticons
looking to build?

05:34.850 --> 05:38.780
Lord Megatron, I have determined
that the synthetic Energon

05:38.780 --> 05:42.150
formula provided by Knockout
is the source of the instability

05:42.150 --> 05:44.150
simply because it is incomplete.

05:44.160 --> 05:48.720
Then make haste and complete
it, we will not only require

05:48.730 --> 05:51.430
enough cyber-matter
to rebuild one planet,

05:51.430 --> 05:55.960
but to remake a second.

05:55.970 --> 05:59.170
<i>Master, excuse my impudence,</i>

05:59.170 --> 06:02.870
but what is the logic
behind ruling two worlds?

06:02.870 --> 06:07.140
It has taken me quite some time
to fully comprehend that Earth

06:07.140 --> 06:09.950
and Cybertron have always been linked,

06:09.950 --> 06:14.980
two halves of one whole,
Primus and Unicron.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.020
And that, to rule only one,

06:17.020 --> 06:21.860
would be to never truly rule either.

06:22.910 --> 06:23.860
<i> Prime!</i>

06:23.860 --> 06:27.100
<i>It's 'Cons again.
In progress this time.</i>

06:29.030 --> 06:31.130
Coordinates received, Agent Fowler.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.970
- Let's roll.
- Yep-yep!

06:36.970 --> 06:39.980
Your ability to roll remains predicated

06:39.980 --> 06:43.180
upon further exploration
of your manual dexterity.

06:47.380 --> 06:50.920
I'm afraid that Ratchet's
authority supersedes my own

06:50.920 --> 06:54.790
- in medical matters.
- Understood.

08:16.340 --> 08:17.570
Whoa!

08:34.520 --> 08:37.190
Ratchet, reopen the groundbridge...

08:37.190 --> 08:41.500
but ensure that the humans
are kept at a safe distance,

08:41.500 --> 08:47.140
for we will be returning
with a Decepticon prisoner.

08:55.097 --> 08:57.780
<i>Because we had the
foresight to shield our new base</i>

08:57.780 --> 09:00.610
our captive will be unable
to transmit his coordinates

09:00.620 --> 09:02.180
to the Decepticon warship.

09:02.180 --> 09:06.050
Nor will they, in turn, be
able to pinpoint his location.

09:06.060 --> 09:08.020
Guess we have all the time in the world

09:08.020 --> 09:11.590
to make Mr. Personality
tell us everything he knows.

09:11.590 --> 09:14.500
The 'Con surveillance chief
must know a lot, right?

09:14.500 --> 09:18.170
But Soundwave doesn't speak...
does he?

09:18.170 --> 09:21.500
I'm not sure he even has a face.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.600
<i>With Laserbeak unable</i>

09:23.610 --> 09:26.570
to triangulate Soundwave's
current location,

09:26.580 --> 09:30.810
are you not concerned about
what our comrade might spill?

09:30.810 --> 09:33.210
Of one thing, I'm certain,

09:33.220 --> 09:36.980
Soundwave knows when
to impart information,

09:36.990 --> 09:40.750
and when to withhold it.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.790
<i>Why is Megatron stealing
human technology?</i>

09:44.790 --> 09:47.830
<i>What is he attempting to build?</i>

09:47.830 --> 09:51.300
<i>"Why is Megatron stealing human technology?</i>

09:51.300 --> 09:56.100
<i>What is he att... attempting to build?"</i>

09:56.110 --> 09:59.640
Whoa, Optimus Prime: The remix.

10:05.310 --> 10:09.080
Oh, yeah? Why don't I wipe
that smile right off his face.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.220
Soundwave, we have treated you fairly.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.190
For the sake of the
natives of this planet,

10:15.190 --> 10:18.260
tell us what Megatron
is attempting to build,

10:18.260 --> 10:24.930
before we are forced to rely upon
less civil methods of interrogation.

10:34.140 --> 10:35.840
Scrap this!

10:35.840 --> 10:39.950
Soundwave is no ordinary
Cybertronian, inside or out,

10:39.950 --> 10:43.780
so I would strongly suggest
opening him up, so we can have

10:43.790 --> 10:47.020
a first-hand look at the information
recorded on his drives.

10:51.930 --> 10:55.360
- Uh-oh.
- All right, he's downloading data.

10:55.360 --> 10:59.030
No.
Soundwave is erasing data.

11:02.070 --> 11:07.740
<i>Soundwave superior.
Autobots inferior.</i>

11:14.220 --> 11:15.750
Is he...?

11:17.620 --> 11:20.150
His vital signs remain functional.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.720
It seems he has simply
severed all communications,

11:23.730 --> 11:27.030
by crashing his own drives.

11:32.330 --> 11:36.040
<i> Lord Megatron, I have
located the one item upon this world</i>

11:36.040 --> 11:40.070
<i>which possesses enough raw tonnage
to power the reconstructed Omega lock,</i>

11:40.080 --> 11:42.240
a particle collider's Synchrotron.

11:42.240 --> 11:47.710
- Excellent, Shockwave.
- However, the successful completion

11:47.720 --> 11:50.680
of the synthetic Energon
formula is proving to be

11:50.690 --> 11:52.790
far more difficult than anticipated.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.990
Knockout first procured
this unfinished shamble

11:58.990 --> 12:01.730
from the Autobot medic, did he not?

12:01.730 --> 12:06.130
- That is my understanding.
- Then the most efficient means to an end

12:06.140 --> 12:09.870
may very well be to recruit that medic.

12:09.870 --> 12:13.110
Attempting to abduct the
one Autobot who rarely leaves

12:13.110 --> 12:16.140
their base... a base
we have yet to locate...

12:16.150 --> 12:18.980
may prove to be a challenge.

12:18.980 --> 12:24.280
You forget that we currently have
an Agent within the Autobot base.

12:24.290 --> 12:26.950
Laserbeak could
reconnect with Soundwave,

12:26.960 --> 12:28.920
and upload his directive to him.

12:28.920 --> 12:33.230
Which would still require knowing
the location of their base.

12:33.230 --> 12:36.900
It is my understanding that
Soundwave kept surveillance

12:36.900 --> 12:40.430
records of more than
just the human children.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.400
<i>Prime!</i>

12:42.400 --> 12:44.940
These recent 'Con
heists have General Bryce

12:44.940 --> 12:46.440
breathing down my neck.
So I gotta get back

12:46.440 --> 12:50.080
to the barbecue today
for another grilling.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.110
<i>Understood, Agent Fowler.</i>

12:52.110 --> 12:56.180
And rest assured, should
our prisoner return online,

12:56.190 --> 13:00.190
we will resume our interrogation.

13:00.190 --> 13:04.060
Sounds like a plan. I'll get
back to base as soon as possible.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.390
<i>You summoned me, lord Megatron.</i>

13:21.390 --> 13:25.760
I require your services,
since we anticipate

13:25.760 --> 13:29.770
an Autobot presence at our next event.

13:29.770 --> 13:35.270
<i>I welcome any opportunity to face
the Prime again, warrior to warrior.</i>

13:35.270 --> 13:38.370
You pride yourself on your evolution,

13:38.380 --> 13:41.480
yet you have learned nothing!

13:41.480 --> 13:44.280
I may have lost my
surveillance chief today.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.620
The Autobots have expanded their forces,

13:46.620 --> 13:49.380
while ours continue to dwindle.

13:49.390 --> 13:52.990
Then I shall simply
battle twice as fiercely.

13:52.990 --> 13:55.960
As a beast.

13:57.630 --> 14:00.630
I'm on my way to the
base but I just got word.

14:00.630 --> 14:03.570
<i>The 'Cons busted into
the Solaris particle collider project</i>

14:03.570 --> 14:05.500
<i>at the South pole.</i>

14:05.500 --> 14:07.430
Autobots.

14:07.650 --> 14:13.740
- Wha...? Yip-yip...
- Doc, the Commander's ready.

14:17.260 --> 14:19.110
Fine, fine...

14:19.820 --> 14:23.750
Bulkhead, Smokescreen,
remain here with Ratchet

14:23.750 --> 14:29.040
to guard our prisoner.
Everyone else, transform and roll out.

14:41.740 --> 14:45.440
Can't we throw a tarp over him?
He's creeping me out.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.910
Yeah. It's like he's watching,
no matter where you go.

14:48.910 --> 14:51.680
Would both of you stop
focusing on what Soundwave

14:51.680 --> 14:56.290
can or cannot see and help me
figure out what he did not tell?

14:56.290 --> 14:59.420
Like why Megatron would be
interested in something believed

14:59.420 --> 15:03.830
to generate enough power
to create a black hole.

15:22.610 --> 15:24.380
Black holes?

15:24.380 --> 15:27.320
So Megatron's looking to
swallow up the known universe.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.550
- And everything in it.
- No, no. He would merely

15:30.580 --> 15:34.090
want to harness the power of
something capable of swallowing worlds,

15:34.090 --> 15:39.540
in order to... create one.
Oh, my.

15:49.710 --> 15:52.470
<i>Optimus,
I know this hardly seems the time...</i>

15:52.480 --> 15:54.040
<i>but it may aid you in your task.</i>

15:56.380 --> 15:57.850
Go ahead.

15:57.850 --> 16:02.720
<i>I believe that Megatron may be
attempting to rebuild the Omega lock.</i>

16:02.720 --> 16:04.790
Do we let him?

16:04.790 --> 16:07.890
<i>No.
For you know as well as I</i>

16:07.890 --> 16:10.130
<i>that Megatron will use
a reconstructed lock</i>

16:10.130 --> 16:13.700
<i>to cyberform both Cybertron and Earth.</i>

16:13.700 --> 16:18.400
And that is one abuse of
power that we cannot allow.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.870
Understood.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.770
Down!

17:10.190 --> 17:14.819
The Decepticons must not be
allowed to secure their target.

17:19.630 --> 17:22.099
I will engage the Predacon.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.600
You heard your leader.
Forge ahead.

20:08.730 --> 20:10.700
Somebody knew we were comin'.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.740
You think?

20:25.210 --> 20:28.180
Ratchet, it may not be with
the Forge or the Omega lock,

20:28.190 --> 20:31.350
but we're gonna find a way
to get our planet repaired.

20:42.260 --> 20:44.070
Oh, no.
