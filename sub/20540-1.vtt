and He said,

let it rain on your speech."

if God did look down

would have been,

09:30.567 --> 09:35.467
the number's probably
28%, 29%, as high as 35%--

09:35.467 --> 09:38.700
in fact, I even
heard recently 42%.

09:38.700 --> 09:42.533
- Well--well which one
is it then?

09:42.533 --> 09:45.066
Because a 4.9% rate
might result in

09:45.066 --> 09:47.333
a cautiously constrictive
monetary policy,

09:47.333 --> 09:49.633
whereas a 42% rate

09:49.633 --> 09:52.834
might result in "The Purge."

09:52.834 --> 09:55.367
So--so tonight,
we thought it would be useful

09:55.367 --> 09:57.533
to try and answer
four basic questions.

09:57.533 --> 10:00.400
How did we get a pathological
liar in the White House?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.266
Where are his lies
coming from?

10:02.266 --> 10:04.266
Why do so many people
believe him?

10:04.266 --> 10:06.266
And what can we
possibly do about it?

10:06.266 --> 10:07.767
And to that first question,

10:07.767 --> 10:10.300
Trump's lying is obviously
nothing new.

10:10.300 --> 10:14.166
He has a well-documented
40-year history of bullshit.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.600
Uh, he lied about
being invited on this show,

10:16.600 --> 10:19.200
uh, and about the ratings
for "The Celebrity Apprentice."

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
He pretended to be
his own publicist.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.400
Even his building, Trump Tower,

10:23.400 --> 10:25.834
is not as big as
he says it is.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.734
- He inflated the floor numbers.

10:27.734 --> 10:32.200
His 58-story building
became a 68-story building.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.467
- It made a lot of sense
in his mind because

10:34.467 --> 10:36.567
if you're renting a room,
you'd rather be on

10:36.567 --> 10:38.700
the 14th floor
than on the 6th floor.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.800
- Just spare a thought

10:40.800 --> 10:44.567
for confused firefighters
turning up to that building.

10:44.567 --> 10:47.834
"The smoke alarm's going off in
penthouse B on the 68th floor,

10:47.834 --> 10:50.834
"which is apparently
an alcove studio on the 58th.

10:50.834 --> 10:54.133
Quick, it's an emergency!"

10:54.133 --> 10:56.900
But lies like that
are almost charming.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.133
What is less harmless
is when he started

10:59.133 --> 11:00.967
lying about the president's
birth certificate

11:00.967 --> 11:02.867
and then,
as a presidential candidate,

11:02.867 --> 11:05.900
started making troubling
statements like these.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.767
- The murder rate
in the United States,

11:08.767 --> 11:12.700
it's the worst, the highest
it's been in 45 years.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.333
Our president wants to
take in 250,000 from Syria.

11:16.333 --> 11:20.233
Our gross domestic product,

11:20.233 --> 11:22.700
a sign of strength, right?

11:22.700 --> 11:25.233
But not for us.

11:25.233 --> 11:28.967
It was below zero.
Who ever heard of this?

11:28.967 --> 11:31.000
- Okay, okay, just--just--

11:31.000 --> 11:32.800
just real quick on those.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.133
No, it isn't; no, he didn't;

11:35.133 --> 11:37.967
and no one's ever heard
of a GDP below zero

11:37.967 --> 11:40.900
because that is
fucking impossible!

11:40.900 --> 11:43.467
Now, any one of those falsehoods

11:43.467 --> 11:47.200
could have disqualified him
for office.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.800
But--but we were so accustomed
to Trump's nonsense,

11:49.800 --> 11:52.700
people could just shrug it off
as "Donald being Donald."

11:52.700 --> 11:55.166
Even his own advisers,
like Peter Thiel,

11:55.166 --> 11:57.800
argued that people shouldn't
worry about his statements

11:57.800 --> 11:59.934
because he didn't
really mean them.

11:59.934 --> 12:02.967
- I think a lot of the voters
who vote for Trump,

12:02.967 --> 12:06.266
um, take Trump seriously
but not literally.

12:06.266 --> 12:08.567
And so when
they hear things like,

12:08.567 --> 12:10.700
the Muslim comment
or the wall comment

12:10.700 --> 12:12.867
or things like that,
it's not, uh,

12:12.867 --> 12:14.767
the question's not, you know,
"Are you gonna build a wall

12:14.767 --> 12:16.533
like the Great Wall of China?"

12:16.533 --> 12:18.200
Or, you know, "How--how exactly

12:18.200 --> 12:20.000
are you gonna enforce
these--these tests?"

12:20.000 --> 12:23.266
What they hear is, uh,
"We're gonna have--

12:23.266 --> 12:26.967
we're gonna have a saner, more
sensible immigration policy."

12:26.967 --> 12:30.166
- Oh, yeah, that is
definitely the sense I got

12:30.166 --> 12:31.900
from watching
those Trump rallies.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.500
"Yes, while we're all furiously
chanting 'Build that wall,'

12:35.500 --> 12:37.467
"we all understand
in this context

12:37.467 --> 12:40.133
"'wall' is a clever use
of metonymy,

12:40.133 --> 12:42.867
"uh, or a figure of speech
in which one word,

12:42.867 --> 12:45.667
"'wall' in this example,
is used as a stand-in

12:45.667 --> 12:48.734
"for 'a saner, more sensible
immigration policy.'

12:48.734 --> 12:50.200
"Now, if you will,

12:50.200 --> 12:54.133
let's unpack
'Trump the bitch.'"

12:54.133 --> 12:56.133
And--and yet,

12:56.133 --> 12:58.567
the travel ban
literally happened.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.266
And as for the wall...

13:00.266 --> 13:04.600
- The wall is getting
designed right now.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.967
A lot of people say,
"Oh, oh.

13:06.967 --> 13:08.600
Trump was only kidding
with the wall."

13:08.600 --> 13:09.934
I wasn't kidd--I don't kid.

13:09.934 --> 13:11.266
- Exactly.

13:11.266 --> 13:13.300
When he says
he's going to build a wall,

13:13.300 --> 13:14.433
he means it.

13:14.433 --> 13:16.033
Now, it might be 30-feet high

13:16.033 --> 13:18.367
and labeled "156 stories,"

13:18.367 --> 13:20.567
but assume that it's coming.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.000
So it was worth
taking him seriously.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.066
Trump was telling the truth
about his solutions

13:26.066 --> 13:28.100
to the problems
he was lying about.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.700
And he is now
making real policy

13:30.700 --> 13:32.166
based on fake facts.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.266
Which brings us
to our second question,

13:34.266 --> 13:36.667
where is his
information coming from?

13:36.667 --> 13:40.000
Now, Trump himself has admitted
he gets a lot of it from TV.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.667
Which may explain why
he speaks so confidently about

13:42.667 --> 13:45.200
cable news staples
like crime and terrorism,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.834
but when it comes to
the nuts-and-bolts aspects

13:47.834 --> 13:50.700
of government, like the
nuclear triad, he struggles.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.500
Now, he famously flubbed
a question on the triad during

13:53.500 --> 13:56.967
an early debate in an exchange
that ended like this.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.700
- Of the three legs
of the triad, though,

13:58.700 --> 14:00.200
do you have a priority?

14:00.200 --> 14:01.533
'Cause I want to go to Senator
Rubio after that and ask him--

14:01.533 --> 14:03.533
- No, I--I think--I think
to me, luc--nuclear's just

14:03.533 --> 14:07.467
the--the power, the devastation
is very important to me.

14:07.467 --> 14:10.400
- Now that is terrifying.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.567
The components of that triad
are important.

14:13.567 --> 14:15.900
It is unacceptable
not to be able to name

14:15.900 --> 14:16.934
every single one of them.

14:16.934 --> 14:19.834
They are nuclear weapons,
not your children.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.166
What is her name, Donald?

14:22.166 --> 14:23.633
What is her name?

14:23.633 --> 14:25.266
I'll give you a hint,

14:25.266 --> 14:27.367
it starts with T.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.867
And it's not "The Other One."

14:29.867 --> 14:32.200
And--and you would hope

14:32.200 --> 14:35.033
that as president,
he'd now be getting information

14:35.033 --> 14:36.600
from prime resources
and briefings.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
But Trump still watches

14:37.600 --> 14:39.667
a phenomenal amount
of cable news.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.867
His tweets frequently
echo things

14:41.867 --> 14:43.467
that just aired on TV.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.567
Just two weeks ago,
he tweeted "Ungrateful TRAITOR

14:46.567 --> 14:48.233
"Chelsea Manning, who should
never have been

14:48.233 --> 14:50.633
"released from prison, is now
calling President Obama

14:50.633 --> 14:52.233
a weak leader.
Terrible!"

14:52.233 --> 14:54.567
Which is interesting
because Chelsea Manning

14:54.567 --> 14:56.867
never used the words
"weak leader."

14:56.867 --> 15:00.066
But that phrase
was used on Fox News

15:00.066 --> 15:02.400
just 15 minutes
before he tweeted

15:02.400 --> 15:04.166
in a segment which also
called Manning

15:04.166 --> 15:05.967
an "ungrateful traitor."

15:05.967 --> 15:07.567
So the president seems to tweet

15:07.567 --> 15:11.233
about whatever information
he just saw on cable news.

15:11.233 --> 15:13.500
If someone changed the channel
to the Sprout network

15:13.500 --> 15:15.934
he'd tweet,
"Caillou's life is boring

15:15.934 --> 15:19.400
even for a cancer kid.
SAD!"

15:19.400 --> 15:21.400
Now, to give you a sense

15:21.400 --> 15:24.200
of just how much
he watches cable news,

15:24.200 --> 15:27.000
a few hours later
he was on "Air Force One,"

15:27.000 --> 15:30.233
and you could actually hear
the commercials from Fox News

15:30.233 --> 15:31.967
blaring in the background.

15:31.967 --> 15:35.433
- ♪ 800-588-2300 ♪

15:35.433 --> 15:38.033
- Doing good, thank you.
- ♪ Empire ♪

15:38.033 --> 15:39.433
- That's real.

15:39.433 --> 15:42.400
That is
the Empire Carpet jingle

15:42.400 --> 15:44.200
playing at full blast.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.667
Trump just made
the interior of "Air Force One"

15:46.667 --> 15:48.767
sound like the living room
of an old person

15:48.767 --> 15:53.300
who died three days ago
and who nobody's found yet.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.700
He watches so much cable TV,

15:55.700 --> 15:59.233
he presumably also gets
daily briefings from this guy.

15:59.233 --> 16:02.233
- I'm a professional cowboy,
and I use catheters.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.600
Been cowboyin' for 25 years.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.500
I've broken 14 bones,
had two concussions,

16:07.500 --> 16:08.700
and a punctured lung.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.767
I know pain, and
I don't want any more of it,

16:11.767 --> 16:13.266
especially when I cath.

16:13.266 --> 16:15.000
- Okay, stop.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.166
I have so many questions.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.433
Is "cath" a real verb?

16:20.433 --> 16:23.100
If you've only been
cowboyin' for 25 years,

16:23.100 --> 16:25.734
what did you do
before you were cowboyin'?

16:25.734 --> 16:27.166
And why are you in a library,

16:27.166 --> 16:30.633
and one that doesn't want
to overdo it with the books?

16:30.633 --> 16:33.767
You fascinate me.

16:33.767 --> 16:36.734
But Trump doesn't
just watch cable news.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.233
He also takes information in

16:38.233 --> 16:40.567
from frighteningly unreliable
sources,

16:40.567 --> 16:42.900
such as Breitbart,
the organization

16:42.900 --> 16:44.333
which gave us Steve Bannon...
[crowd booing]

16:44.333 --> 16:47.467
Steve Bannon, now
Trump's chief strategist.

16:47.467 --> 16:51.000
Breitbart has published
such Pulitzer-eligible stories

16:51.000 --> 16:54.700
as "Birth Control Makes Women
Unattractive and Crazy,"

16:54.700 --> 16:57.834
"Racist, Pro-Nazi Roots
of Planned Parenthood Revealed,"

16:57.834 --> 16:59.600
and "Hoist It High and Proud:

16:59.600 --> 17:02.100
The Confederate Flag
Proclaims a Glorious Heritage."

17:02.100 --> 17:04.166
You know, the kind of--
the kind of headlines

17:04.166 --> 17:05.734
you see your old
high school friend

17:05.734 --> 17:08.467
share on Facebook and think,
"Oh, that's a shame.

17:08.467 --> 17:11.367
I guess Greg sucks now."

17:11.367 --> 17:13.700
But--but Trump's
trust in Breitbart

17:13.700 --> 17:15.333
actually goes way back.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.066
A few years ago, Trump was
challenged by Bill O'Reilly,

17:18.066 --> 17:20.400
who correctly pointed out
that his claim

17:20.400 --> 17:23.066
that thousands of Muslims
were seen celebrating

17:23.066 --> 17:26.767
in New Jersey on 9/11 was
based on no evidence whatsoever.

17:26.767 --> 17:29.133
And this is how Trump responded.

17:29.133 --> 17:30.700
- Well, I don't know
that I'm wrong, Bill.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.133
You know, uh, this just
came out from Breitbart.

17:33.133 --> 17:35.266
I mean, literally,
it just came out.

17:35.266 --> 17:37.967
"Trump Vindicated--
100% Vindicated."

17:37.967 --> 17:39.333
- Believe me, if there
were thousands,

17:39.333 --> 17:40.667
that would have been reported.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.066
Um, but--but what I'm trying
to get at is this--

17:42.066 --> 17:43.467
- Well, this article says
they were swarming.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.467
Bill, this article
says they were

17:45.467 --> 17:46.967
swarming all over the place.
- All right.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.300
- So I don't know
what that means,

17:48.300 --> 17:49.600
but it means a lot of people.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.266
- Wait.

17:51.266 --> 17:53.333
Holding up a Breitbart article

17:53.333 --> 17:55.767
does not make you seem
more credible.

17:55.767 --> 17:58.266
You might as well have gone,
"Oh, hold on a second, Bill.

17:58.266 --> 18:00.200
"Hello?
Okay, thanks.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.233
"Sources are saying
I'm right, Bill.

18:02.233 --> 18:04.266
"My sources--talk to them.

18:04.266 --> 18:06.500
Talk to my sources, William."

18:06.500 --> 18:07.500
[cheers and applause]

18:07.500 --> 18:09.934
And--and Trump's sources

18:09.934 --> 18:12.000
get even worse,
because he also cited

18:12.000 --> 18:14.400
an article to support his
"Muslims on 9/11" claim

18:14.400 --> 18:18.100
from Infowars,
a website run by this guy.

18:18.100 --> 18:22.100
- Hillary and Obama want to
make you poor and pathetic.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.767
We have all their white papers.
They hate you!

18:24.767 --> 18:27.567
They hate prosperity!
They hate God!

18:27.567 --> 18:30.600
They hate children!
And God damn them to Hell!

18:30.600 --> 18:33.700
- That man--
that man is Alex Jones.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.900
And that is actually
him at his most presentable.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.633
That is Alex Jones
at a job interview.

18:39.633 --> 18:42.166
That's Alex Jones meeting
his girlfriend's parents

18:42.166 --> 18:43.867
for the first time.

18:43.867 --> 18:45.767
Now, in his
more outspoken moments,

18:45.767 --> 18:48.133
Jones has argued that
the government has the ability

18:48.133 --> 18:49.567
to control tornados;

18:49.567 --> 18:52.200
that the Boston Marathon bombing
was a false-flag attack;

18:52.200 --> 18:54.567
and that tap water
is a gay bomb;

18:54.567 --> 18:56.867
and that they are
putting chemicals in the water

18:56.867 --> 18:59.533
that turn
the friggin' frogs gay.

18:59.533 --> 19:02.800
And then, there is
the Sandy Hook school shooting.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.967
- Yeah, so, Sandy Hook

19:04.967 --> 19:09.567
is a synthetic,
completely fake, with actors,

19:09.567 --> 19:11.467
in my view, manufactured.

19:11.467 --> 19:13.233
I couldn't believe it at first.

19:13.233 --> 19:15.233
I knew they had
actors there, clearly,

19:15.233 --> 19:17.033
but I thought
they killed some real kids.

19:17.033 --> 19:20.033
And it just shows
how bold they are,

19:20.033 --> 19:22.667
that they clearly used actors.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.333
- Now,
that is not just offensive,

19:25.333 --> 19:26.500
it's stupid.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.633
If the government had
actually hired child actors,

19:29.633 --> 19:31.633
there is no way
their stage parents

19:31.633 --> 19:33.367
would have stopped
talking about it.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.333
"Well, he didn't
get the Tide commercial,

19:35.333 --> 19:37.767
"but he did book a leading role
in a government-sponsored

19:37.767 --> 19:39.066
"false-flag attack.

19:39.066 --> 19:41.533
"It's the same director
who did the moon landing.

19:41.533 --> 19:44.500
We're very excited."

19:44.500 --> 19:46.967
Trump is apparently
such a fan

19:46.967 --> 19:48.867
that Alex Jones himself
has said,

19:48.867 --> 19:51.600
"It is surreal
to talk about issues here on air

19:51.600 --> 19:54.700
and then word for word hear
Trump say it two days later."

19:54.700 --> 19:56.400
And I would be skeptical of that

19:56.400 --> 19:59.266
if Trump hadn't
gone on Jones's show

19:59.266 --> 20:00.567
and said this.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.934
- I just want
to finish by saying

20:01.934 --> 20:03.567
your reputation's amazing.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.367
I will not let you down.

20:05.367 --> 20:08.567
You will be very, very,
uh, impressed, I hope.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.467
And I think we'll be
speaking a lot.

20:10.467 --> 20:11.600
- You know what?

20:11.600 --> 20:13.467
I-I guess it makes sense
that Donald Trump

20:13.467 --> 20:15.100
wants to impress Alex Jones.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.734
Why would you want
to drain the swamp

20:16.734 --> 20:19.667
if not to eradicate
all those gay frogs?

20:19.667 --> 20:23.500
You stay there.
You two stay where you are.

20:23.500 --> 20:26.000
This is really dangerous,
though.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.500
Because there is a pattern here.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.133
Trump sees something
that jibes with his world view,

20:30.133 --> 20:32.400
doesn't check it,
half-remembers it,

20:32.400 --> 20:33.900
and then passes it on.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.300
At which point, it takes on
a life of its own,

20:36.300 --> 20:37.867
and appears to validate itself.

20:37.867 --> 20:40.633
Let me try and show you
that machine in action.

20:40.633 --> 20:42.333
Trump's constant claim that

20:42.333 --> 20:44.133
millions of people
voted illegally

20:44.133 --> 20:46.133
originated,
as far as anyone can tell,

20:46.133 --> 20:49.300
from some dude on Twitter
who claimed in November,

20:49.300 --> 20:52.166
while providing no evidence,
"We have verified

20:52.166 --> 20:55.367
more than three million votes
cast by non-citizens."

20:55.367 --> 20:57.934
The next day,
Infowars picked that up,

20:57.934 --> 21:00.800
and it spread like jet fuel
among the right-wing sites.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.333
Now, it was quickly debunked
by multiple outlets,

21:03.333 --> 21:05.767
but despite that,
days later,

21:05.767 --> 21:08.333
President-elect Trump
started tweeting

21:08.333 --> 21:10.633
about millions of illegal votes

21:10.633 --> 21:13.433
and serious voter fraud
in states like California.

21:13.433 --> 21:16.200
And by early December,
people were on TV,

21:16.200 --> 21:18.567
expressing similar concerns.

21:18.567 --> 21:21.033
- Voting is a privilege
in this country.

21:21.033 --> 21:24.200
And you need to be legal,
not like California,

21:24.200 --> 21:26.233
where 3 million illegals voted.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.166
- Where are you
getting your information?

21:28.166 --> 21:29.333
- From the media.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.867
- And that right there
actually answers

21:31.867 --> 21:34.700
our third question of why
so many people believe Trump.

21:34.700 --> 21:38.133
Because if you get your news
from similar sources to him

21:38.133 --> 21:40.533
as many, many, many people do,

21:40.533 --> 21:42.633
he doesn't look like a crank.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.166
He looks like
the first president

21:44.166 --> 21:46.000
ever to tell you the real truth.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.600
But rumors can be really
tenacious, and I'll prove it.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.300
What rumor do you think of

21:51.300 --> 21:54.233
when you hear the name
Richard Gere?

21:54.233 --> 21:55.734
Well, here's the thing.

21:55.734 --> 21:58.367
There is no proof
that he did that.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.433
If you think about it,
it's ridiculous.

22:00.433 --> 22:02.700
Have you ever held
one of those things?

22:02.700 --> 22:05.333
There's no way it was possible.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.367
But if the president
went on TV

22:07.367 --> 22:09.734
and told you it was true,
you'd go, "I knew it.

22:09.734 --> 22:11.767
"Thank you!
I knew it.

22:11.767 --> 22:13.834
Finally, someone said it."

22:13.834 --> 22:15.800
But that loop
gets much more dangerous

22:15.800 --> 22:17.000
when you're not talking about

22:17.000 --> 22:19.500
something as silly as gerbils.

22:19.500 --> 22:23.100
Trump validated his supporters'
beliefs about voter fraud,

22:23.100 --> 22:25.667
and in turn, they validated his.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.800
Because even when he was
directly confronted

22:27.800 --> 22:30.600
with the lack of evidence,
this is how he responded.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.834
- You know what's important?

22:31.834 --> 22:34.734
Millions of people agree with me
when I say that.

22:34.734 --> 22:36.900
If you would have looked
on one of the other networks

22:36.900 --> 22:38.900
and all of the people
that were calling in,

22:38.900 --> 22:40.734
they're saying,
"We agree with Mr. Trump.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.133
We agree."
They're very smart people.

22:42.133 --> 22:44.967
- Right, but just because
they believe you

22:44.967 --> 22:47.867
and you believe them,
doesn't make it true.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.100
This isn't like "Peter Pan,"
where believing in fairies

22:51.100 --> 22:53.066
will keep Tinker Bell alive.

22:53.066 --> 22:55.066
This isn't a magic thing,
Peter,

22:55.066 --> 22:57.934
she has Lou Gehrig's disease.

22:57.934 --> 22:59.767
And maybe instead of clapping,
you should have done

22:59.767 --> 23:02.867
the Ice Bucket Challenge,
then she'd still be alive!

23:02.867 --> 23:05.500
I'm sorry, Peter,
but she's dying!

23:05.500 --> 23:09.633
Tinker Bell's dying!

23:09.633 --> 23:11.800
The point is, even if

23:11.800 --> 23:14.266
you take the kindest
approach here,

23:14.266 --> 23:16.734
and assume Trump made
an honest, innocent mistake

23:16.734 --> 23:19.133
and passed along a news story
without checking it,

23:19.133 --> 23:21.667
when he was presented
with a lack of evidence,

23:21.667 --> 23:23.266
he disregarded that fact.

23:23.266 --> 23:25.967
At which point, he is lying.

23:25.967 --> 23:28.066
And it seems no one
in the White House

23:28.066 --> 23:29.233
has a problem with that.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.700
'Cause when asked to
justify the president's views,

23:31.700 --> 23:33.767
this is what Sean Spicer did.

23:33.767 --> 23:35.767
- I think the president
has believed that for a while.

23:35.767 --> 23:37.834
A long-standing belief
that he's maintained.

23:37.834 --> 23:38.967
It's a belief he maintains.

23:38.967 --> 23:41.000
It's a belief that
he's maintained for a while.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.767
As I noted several times now,

23:42.767 --> 23:44.233
he's believed this
for a long time.

23:44.233 --> 23:46.767
It was a comment that he made
on a long-standing belief.

23:46.767 --> 23:48.467
I've asked and answered
this question twice.

23:48.467 --> 23:49.500
He believes what he believes,

23:49.500 --> 23:50.867
based on the information
that he's provided.

23:50.867 --> 23:52.767
- If he does believe that, what
does that mean for democracy?

23:52.767 --> 23:54.700
- It means that, yeah,
I've answered your question.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.734
- Have you?

23:55.734 --> 23:59.133
- No, you haven't, Melissa.
No, you haven't.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.266
[laughter, cheers, and applause]

24:00.266 --> 24:04.033
Because this isn't
about belief.

24:04.033 --> 24:05.200
It can't be.

24:05.200 --> 24:09.100
The incidence of voter fraud
is a verifiable fact.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.934
And faith and fact

24:10.934 --> 24:13.133
aren't like
Bill Pullman and Bill Paxton.

24:13.133 --> 24:16.867
When you confuse them,
it actually matters.

24:16.867 --> 24:19.734
Real people get hurt
when you make policy

24:19.734 --> 24:20.867
based on false information.

24:20.867 --> 24:23.734
Billions will get spent
on a war that won't work,

24:23.734 --> 24:26.100
to prevent a crime wave
that isn't happening,

24:26.100 --> 24:28.400
while refugees
sit in dangerous situations

24:28.400 --> 24:30.433
to prevent
"Bowling Green" style massacres

24:30.433 --> 24:32.000
that never took place.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.033
So what are we going to do?

24:35.033 --> 24:38.333
Well, the press is
going to be a key element

24:38.333 --> 24:40.467
in helping us sort out
fact from fiction.

24:40.467 --> 24:42.266
And they are under attack.

24:42.266 --> 24:44.767
This administration has
seized on small corrections

24:44.767 --> 24:46.834
in news coverage
to paint critical outlets

24:46.834 --> 24:50.467
as fake news, attempting to
delegitimize all of them.

24:50.467 --> 24:52.500
And this is only
going to get worse.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.934
Steve Bannon has already
labeled the media

24:54.934 --> 24:56.300
"the opposition party."

24:56.300 --> 24:59.400
Although, there does
seem to be one exception.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.266
- News reports
said the only seat

25:01.266 --> 25:02.734
that was reserved for the media

25:02.734 --> 25:05.734
at Trump's news conference
Wednesday was in the front row,

25:05.734 --> 25:08.300
and it was for Breitbart News.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.400
- Oh, that is
some blatant favoritism!

25:11.400 --> 25:14.400
You are Snow White
introducing the dwarfs, saying,

25:14.400 --> 25:16.467
"Meet Grump, Sneezy, Sleepy,

25:16.467 --> 25:18.400
"Fucking-Awesome-Big-Dick-Cool
Dwarf,

25:18.400 --> 25:20.300
and the three others."

25:20.300 --> 25:21.734
And--and if you are thinking

25:21.734 --> 25:23.700
that Breitbart
went out of their way

25:23.700 --> 25:27.000
to ask a challenging question,
think again.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.500
- Go ahead.

25:37.433 --> 25:39.633
- And I actually have
two follow-up questions.

25:39.633 --> 25:40.734
Does this feel good?

25:40.734 --> 25:43.400
And will you let me know
when you're going to come?

25:43.400 --> 25:45.033
Just--just--just tap my head.

25:45.033 --> 25:45.967
Tap--tap my head.

25:45.967 --> 25:49.233
Look,
the end game here is obvious.

25:49.233 --> 25:51.633
With a completely
delegitimized press,

25:51.633 --> 25:54.734
you're only going to have one
source to get your news from,

25:54.734 --> 25:57.433
as one congressman
happily pointed out.

25:57.433 --> 26:00.867
- Better to get your news
directly from the president.

26:00.867 --> 26:03.200
In fact,
it might be the only way

26:03.200 --> 26:05.400
to get the unvarnished truth.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.967
- Getting your news
directly from the leader

26:07.967 --> 26:10.700
is basically the philosophy
of North Korea.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.533
And--and the notion
that our leaders

26:13.533 --> 26:16.567
should be able to pass on
mistruths with impunity

26:16.567 --> 26:19.333
should be alarming
to absolutely everybody,

26:19.333 --> 26:20.900
regardless of politics.

26:20.900 --> 26:24.000
Republicans should badly want
our sense of objective reality

26:24.000 --> 26:26.667
to remain intact,
just in case the Democrats

26:26.667 --> 26:28.934
ever find their own
appealing reality star

26:28.934 --> 26:30.166
to win back the White House.

26:30.166 --> 26:32.567
RuPaul, for instance.

26:32.567 --> 26:34.333
Make America fierce again.

26:34.333 --> 26:37.834
#MAKEAMERICAFIERCEAGAIN.

26:37.834 --> 26:40.567
So--so we all need to commit

26:40.567 --> 26:42.567
to defending
the reality of facts.

26:42.567 --> 26:43.934
But it's going to take work.

26:43.934 --> 26:46.000
As we've already seen,
protests,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.734
calls to legislators,
and lawsuits

26:47.734 --> 26:49.300
are effective ways
to try and drag

26:49.300 --> 26:51.600
the administration
back to reality,

26:51.600 --> 26:54.600
but this needs to go down
to a personal level as well.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.633
We should make extra efforts
on social media

26:56.633 --> 26:59.066
to try and verify stories
before passing them on,

26:59.066 --> 27:02.400
especially if they confirm
our preexisting biases.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.300
Ask questions of yourself,
like,

27:04.300 --> 27:06.266
"Is this a source
I know and recognize?"

27:06.266 --> 27:07.667
"Has anyone fact-checked this?"

27:07.667 --> 27:09.633
"Does it link
to primary sources,

27:09.633 --> 27:11.967
and do those sources match
what the story says?"

27:11.967 --> 27:14.567
And if you see an outlet
repeatedly getting things wrong

27:14.567 --> 27:17.500
and never correcting it,
maybe stop trusting it,

27:17.500 --> 27:19.767
whether that outlet
is some idiot's blog

27:19.767 --> 27:21.600
or the White House.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.767
And--and because I know
our president

27:23.767 --> 27:26.367
will not follow
any of those suggestions,

27:26.367 --> 27:29.567
partly because, rightfully,
he does not watch this show,

27:29.567 --> 27:31.533
there is--
there is one small way

27:31.533 --> 27:33.800
we wanted to try
and sneak some useful facts

27:33.800 --> 27:35.066
into his media diet.

27:35.066 --> 27:36.133
As we now know,

27:36.133 --> 27:38.800
he watches morning cable news
for information.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.200
So we've actually created
a series of commercials

27:41.200 --> 27:43.100
in an attempt
to bring him up to speed

27:43.100 --> 27:45.667
on some information he may lack.
[cheers and applause]

27:45.667 --> 27:47.300
We're going to
run them on shows

27:47.300 --> 27:49.300
that we know
he watches every day.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.367
Take a look.

27:52.166 --> 27:54.800
- I'm a professional cowboy
and I use catheters.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.266
Been cowboyin' for 25 years
and there's two things I know.

27:58.266 --> 28:01.166
I don't like pain
when I cath.

28:01.166 --> 28:04.300
And the nuclear triad consists
of land-based missiles,

28:04.300 --> 28:07.200
submarine-launched missiles,
and aerial bombers.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.834
This increases our ability
to strike back

28:09.834 --> 28:11.967
in the event
one of those is destroyed

28:11.967 --> 28:14.467
and deters and attack
on us or our allies.

28:14.467 --> 28:16.800
So that's the nuclear triad,
in case you're

28:16.800 --> 28:19.800
the kind of person who might
really need to know that.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.667
[laughter]

28:20.667 --> 28:23.333
- That ad will air
tomorrow morning

28:23.333 --> 28:26.900
between 8:30 and 9:00
on all these channels

28:26.900 --> 28:28.467
in the DC area.

28:28.467 --> 28:30.467
And until we're shut down,

28:30.467 --> 28:32.500
we are prepared
to educate Donald Trump

28:32.500 --> 28:33.867
one by one on topics

28:33.867 --> 28:36.066
we're pretty sure
he doesn't know about.

28:36.066 --> 28:37.967
Here's just a taste.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.266
- It might seem
like a show of strength

28:40.266 --> 28:41.934
to kill the families
of terrorists,

28:41.934 --> 28:43.867
but according to
the Geneva conventions,

28:43.867 --> 28:45.533
it's actually a war crime.

28:45.533 --> 28:48.500
Not all black people
live in the inner cities.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.767
And not all people
in the inner cities are black.

28:51.767 --> 28:54.133
Now, there's something
you may not know.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.033
Appetizer fork.

28:56.033 --> 28:57.900
Entrée fork.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.900
Now, I know
it can sometimes feel

28:59.900 --> 29:02.266
as if you are
the only person in the world,

29:02.266 --> 29:04.433
but, as you can see here,

29:04.433 --> 29:07.333
there are actually
many non-you people.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.600
We call those "other people."

29:09.600 --> 29:11.500
Just because sometimes
it's cold,

29:11.500 --> 29:13.500
that don't mean
there's no global warming.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.967
You're confusing
climate with weather, partner.

29:15.967 --> 29:19.500
Gabon is a country
on the west coast of Africa.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.367
Tiffany.

29:21.367 --> 29:24.400
"Tif-fa-ny."

29:24.400 --> 29:25.600
Tiffany.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.867
The unemployment rate is
a carefully-calculated measure

29:28.867 --> 29:30.233
derived from a monthly survey

29:30.233 --> 29:32.633
conducted by
two federal agencies

29:32.633 --> 29:34.700
and has been
the agreed-upon standard

29:34.700 --> 29:36.233
since 1948.

29:36.233 --> 29:40.433
And that little fellow there

29:40.433 --> 29:43.767
is what we call "the clitoris."

29:43.767 --> 29:45.266
Just remember, Donald,

29:45.266 --> 29:48.800
if you don't know,
it's okay to ask.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.567
See you tomorrow.

29:50.567 --> 29:52.066
[cheers and applause]

29:52.066 --> 29:54.100
That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.533
We'll see you next week.
Good night.
