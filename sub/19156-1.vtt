01:25.126 --> 01:28.667
- So, Philippe?
- Yeah, the mechanics did a great job.

01:28.876 --> 01:31.042
- It's a real beauty.
- She's a what?

01:31.709 --> 01:32.876
A real beauty!

01:33.042 --> 01:34.959
Well, your beauty
still smells of car grease.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.876
That's part of her charm, man.

01:54.126 --> 01:56.709
I don't want to spoil the party, but...

01:57.292 --> 01:58.376
What?

01:58.709 --> 02:01.292
How far do you think
this seaplane can glide?

02:01.376 --> 02:03.417
There's only one way to know, right?

02:05.334 --> 02:06.751
Just kidding, relax.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.501
We're going home.

02:28.542 --> 02:30.001
OK. Ready to land.

02:39.834 --> 02:42.792
Shit! Holy shit!

02:43.126 --> 02:44.751
Holy shit!

24:31.792 --> 24:34.292
"Don't Knock It"
by The Delta Rhythm Boys

41:43.959 --> 41:45.084
We're late.

42:02.084 --> 42:04.001
Julie! We're late.

42:06.876 --> 42:08.792
Not only do we have the bathyscaphe

42:08.876 --> 42:11.584
but we will also have
two midget submarines on board

42:11.667 --> 42:15.792
to reach depths never,
never seen by man yet.

42:16.792 --> 42:20.209
Now, our divers will be equipped
with streamlined scubas,

42:20.376 --> 42:23.834
fitted out with
an integrated lighting system

42:23.917 --> 42:25.917
and a marine telephony system

42:26.042 --> 42:27.376
to communicate underwater.

42:27.751 --> 42:30.126
- Please have a look.
- James Bond style.

42:30.292 --> 42:33.292
We already broadcast
dozens of animal documentaries...

42:33.417 --> 42:35.251
No, no, no. You did not understand.

42:35.334 --> 42:38.709
We must not have explained it properly.

42:38.959 --> 42:41.709
I am not making animal documentaries.

42:41.876 --> 42:46.417
I am going to tell the story of men
who are going to explore a new world.

42:46.501 --> 42:48.376
Captain Cousteau in the lead

42:48.501 --> 42:51.334
and around him,
a gallery of other personalities.

42:51.709 --> 42:53.834
His loyal right-hand man, BÃ©bert,

42:54.042 --> 42:58.209
and discreet wife, Simone,
who the entire crew adores.

42:58.459 --> 43:02.209
And the son, with the movie star looks,
Philippe.

43:03.084 --> 43:05.459
The spectators will travel with us

43:05.709 --> 43:08.334
to all the oceans
on the face of the earth.

43:08.417 --> 43:10.417
They will discover,
they will explore.

43:10.584 --> 43:12.167
They will share our emotions.

43:12.459 --> 43:14.584
They will be afraid when we take risks.

43:14.667 --> 43:17.292
They will tremble,
they will laugh, they will cry.

43:17.917 --> 43:20.292
It is not stories about fish
that interest people,

43:20.376 --> 43:24.542
it is stories about people and that
is what I intend to show your viewers.

43:24.876 --> 43:27.334
And how many films
will this contract cover?

43:28.042 --> 43:29.667
- Twelve.
- Six!

43:30.251 --> 43:31.292
Twelve.

44:24.959 --> 44:26.001
Thank you.

44:26.126 --> 44:27.667
- To Calypso.
- Calypso!

46:34.126 --> 46:35.417
Stay here.

46:37.751 --> 46:39.042
Come with me.

54:21.751 --> 54:22.959
Doctor Clark.

54:23.126 --> 54:26.417
The Head of the Zoology Department
of the University of Maryland.

54:26.501 --> 54:27.542
- My son Philippe.
- Hi.

54:27.626 --> 54:29.459
Nice to meet you. This way please.

54:29.542 --> 54:33.834
She's the world's most renowned
shark specialist in the world.

54:33.917 --> 54:35.876
Impressive.
You don't have any luggage?

54:36.167 --> 54:39.917
- I was told to travel light.
- OK, great. It's a quick 1-hour flight.

55:09.084 --> 55:15.001
If I had negotiated even 0.1%
of all the oil wells I discovered with him...

55:16.084 --> 55:18.417
You wouldn't have to make TV films.

55:51.501 --> 55:54.667
You stay at the controls.
It's an order. All right?

56:10.709 --> 56:11.751
Yes?

58:01.126 --> 58:02.334
Loubi...

58:35.584 --> 58:38.626
- Welcome. Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

58:39.417 --> 58:40.709
Captain Cousteau.

58:41.251 --> 58:43.959
Do you really believe
that man will colonise the seas?

58:44.042 --> 58:47.084
Oh, absolutely.
I believe that in the near future...

58:47.209 --> 58:51.251
a homo-aquaticus capable
of living underwater will exist.

58:51.834 --> 58:54.792
A shunt connected
to a chemical cartridge

58:55.042 --> 58:56.876
would ensure
the oxygenation of the blood

58:57.126 --> 58:58.834
and thanks to artificial gills,

58:59.001 --> 59:01.751
man would be able to rediscover
its original world.

59:01.917 --> 59:03.126
The aquatic world.

59:03.542 --> 59:07.376
I believe that, with the help of science,
man knows no limits.

59:07.459 --> 59:08.542
I believe so.

01:02:42.084 --> 01:02:43.167
Philippe!

01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:39.126
Nice.

01:03:41.459 --> 01:03:43.001
Chin down a little bit.

01:03:43.792 --> 01:03:44.834
That's nice.

01:03:49.251 --> 01:03:50.334
Excuse me.

01:03:52.084 --> 01:03:54.584
Just check the cable there
on the floor.

01:03:54.959 --> 01:03:55.959
How are you?

01:03:59.417 --> 01:04:01.001
OK, 5 minutes to work.

01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:17.042
I totally agree with you
but you'll have to talk to my colleague.

01:06:17.084 --> 01:06:19.542
I'm very pleased indeed.
Yes.

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:21.376
Hold on.

01:06:25.792 --> 01:06:28.042
All right, talk to her. Talk to her.

01:06:29.751 --> 01:06:32.917
Yes, I have no time now.
I'm sorry I have no time.

01:07:03.542 --> 01:07:06.959
You know, this is exactly where
I went diving for the very first time.

01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:08.751
I would have liked to have seen that.

01:07:10.084 --> 01:07:11.292
Let me check.

01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:14.126
Good. Ready?

01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:17.459
I'm not sure this underwater grotto
is a good idea.

01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:19.376
Can you please trust me?

01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:21.667
This is gonna be unbelievable.
It's fantastic.

01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:23.751
It's like swimming in an aquarium.

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:26.251
You'll love it.

01:07:27.709 --> 01:07:28.751
Let's go.

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:43.959
AllÃ´!

01:08:53.251 --> 01:08:55.542
- Mr. Cousteau?
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:09:37.584 --> 01:09:38.792
Mr. Cousteau?

01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:46.001
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:09:54.126 --> 01:09:56.667
I hear Philippe
has formed his own crew.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:01.042
Yes, I think he wants
to work on slightly different topics.

01:10:01.167 --> 01:10:02.751
- Ecology.
- Yes.

01:10:02.876 --> 01:10:04.209
...Captain Planet.

01:10:04.292 --> 01:10:08.542
I ask you to give a warm welcome
to Mr. Jacques Cousteau.

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:13.834
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

01:12:41.626 --> 01:12:42.667
Baby.

01:12:44.959 --> 01:12:46.084
Look.

01:12:50.501 --> 01:12:51.751
This is home.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.417
Some species of whales

01:13:35.501 --> 01:13:38.209
have already completely disappeared
from the Atlantic

01:13:38.376 --> 01:13:40.167
due to intensive hunting.

01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:43.459
Here, the Great Whale
is affected by pollution.

01:13:43.876 --> 01:13:46.751
- And are we talking about oil slicks?
- Oil slicks,

01:13:47.084 --> 01:13:50.542
heavy metals, garbage,
you name it, it's out there.

01:14:14.001 --> 01:14:15.042
It's love.

01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:48.751
Ah.

01:20:09.376 --> 01:20:10.417
Jacques?

01:22:54.376 --> 01:22:56.834
No, they never mentioned an advance.

01:22:57.834 --> 01:22:59.251
Let me refresh your memory.

01:22:59.334 --> 01:23:02.917
You still owe them two films,
which they've paid for in full.

01:23:03.001 --> 01:23:05.917
You're not gonna squeeze
another dollar out of them, JYC.

01:23:06.834 --> 01:23:10.542
<i>You'll feel sad to leave this entrancing,
magic place,</i>

01:23:10.834 --> 01:23:14.167
<i>but the Calypso,
indifferent to our cause, nostalgia,</i>

01:23:14.251 --> 01:23:17.751
<i>is already setting her course
towards new adventures.</i>

01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:22.459
- So, how did you like it?
- Very much.

01:23:22.542 --> 01:23:25.417
Actually, so much
we'd like to see a little more.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:28.667
JYC, we're worried about
the two remaining films

01:23:28.751 --> 01:23:31.251
you're supposed to deliver
before the end of the year.

01:23:31.334 --> 01:23:34.834
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to deliver four in one go.

01:23:34.959 --> 01:23:38.792
Let me explain to you.
This will be my greatest expedition yet.

01:23:39.167 --> 01:23:44.417
I am going to explore the last
untouched open space in the world.

01:23:44.792 --> 01:23:46.167
Antarctica.

01:23:46.501 --> 01:23:48.792
Frozen Spaces. The white continent.

01:23:48.876 --> 01:23:51.751
Icebergs, whales, penguins...

01:23:52.084 --> 01:23:55.501
Places where man
has never dived before.

01:23:55.917 --> 01:23:59.876
I already have the title.
'Voyage to the End of the World.'

01:24:00.126 --> 01:24:04.126
An expedition like this, we'd have to get
all-new diving equipment.

01:24:04.459 --> 01:24:06.792
And above all,
a special boat, an icebreaker.

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:07.917
David...

01:24:08.584 --> 01:24:12.084
- Have you an idea of the costs?
- I want five million dollars.

01:24:12.292 --> 01:24:14.292
Oh no. No way, no way.

01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:16.376
- How much are you prepared to...
- JYC...

01:24:17.459 --> 01:24:19.126
- One million.
- Max.

01:24:21.751 --> 01:24:23.001
It's a deal.

01:24:23.126 --> 01:24:25.167
That's not even gonna rent you
an icebreaker.

01:24:25.376 --> 01:24:27.917
An icebreaker?
Who needs an icebreaker?

01:24:28.001 --> 01:24:29.834
I am taking Calypso.

01:24:30.001 --> 01:24:32.667
- The Calypso? In the Antarctic Ocean?
- Absolutely.

01:24:32.792 --> 01:24:37.001
- Fabulous! I love that idea.
- She's a very good boat. She'll make it.

01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:39.084
I love that idea.

01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:41.417
Oh, that's great.

01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:33.167
So right over here...

01:25:35.834 --> 01:25:37.042
Two coffees, please.

01:25:44.542 --> 01:25:46.417
Excuse us for bothering you, Captain,

01:25:46.542 --> 01:25:49.209
- but may I ask you for your autograph?
- Yes, of course.

01:25:49.292 --> 01:25:52.751
- I admire you so much.
- I still remember those two sea-lions.

01:25:52.876 --> 01:25:55.334
- What were their names again?
- Pepito and Christobelle.

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:58.292
- Christobelle!
- That's right. They were so adorable.

01:25:58.376 --> 01:26:01.209
- We won't bother you any longer.
- And once again, bravo.

01:26:01.501 --> 01:26:04.334
Thank you very much.
Have a good day. Thank you.

01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:25.792
- OK. And this one?
- Yes, let me check.

01:29:26.626 --> 01:29:29.584
- And this one?
- OK, yeah. This one at the top.

01:31:23.126 --> 01:31:24.209
"My love,

01:31:24.542 --> 01:31:26.667
I don't know
when you'll read this letter,

01:31:27.209 --> 01:31:29.292
but after several days at sea

01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:33.292
writing to you makes me feel
like you're not so far away.

01:31:33.667 --> 01:31:36.751
The ocean here seems more immense
than anywhere else.

01:31:37.501 --> 01:31:40.292
Soon we'll be in sight of the first islands.

01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:43.459
I cannot wait to discover
this unknown world."

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:51.792
We're going to try to circle around
to the west. Over.

01:35:51.876 --> 01:35:53.917
<i>The depression is growing too rapidly.</i>

01:35:54.001 --> 01:35:56.834
<i>The only solution is to turn back
and head for shelter.</i>

01:35:56.959 --> 01:35:59.167
<i>Otherwise, you'll encounter hell. Over.</i>

01:35:59.834 --> 01:36:01.042
Roger that.

01:36:01.251 --> 01:36:04.792
<i>It's time for you to turn back
and seek shelter. Over.</i>

01:36:07.209 --> 01:36:08.542
I'll get back to you.
Over and out.

01:40:23.542 --> 01:40:25.334
Merry Christmas to you, baby!

01:42:23.876 --> 01:42:24.917
Fools!

01:42:25.251 --> 01:42:26.876
No one is gonna buy documentaries

01:42:26.959 --> 01:42:28.334
about ecology. No one.

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:31.834
Yes, because TV channels don't want
any trouble with industrialists.

01:42:31.917 --> 01:42:33.917
- That's why.
- Where the hell is the car?

01:42:34.042 --> 01:42:35.376
They are the ones who pollute,

01:42:35.459 --> 01:42:37.417
but they buy advertising time
every year.

01:42:37.501 --> 01:42:41.501
- Cut out the left-wing diatribe for me.
- Hey, we don't need these guys.

01:42:45.501 --> 01:42:47.584
The world's oceans are in danger.

01:42:48.042 --> 01:42:51.626
I am here today to announce
the creation of the Cousteau Society.

01:42:51.751 --> 01:42:56.334
A non-lucrative organization
whose mission is to protect nature.

01:42:56.792 --> 01:43:00.709
If industrialists pollute,
it is not out of cynicism.

01:43:00.792 --> 01:43:02.417
They do not want
to actively destroy the planet

01:43:02.501 --> 01:43:04.334
and they will be willing to accept

01:43:04.417 --> 01:43:06.167
and follow the regulations
of the politicians,

01:43:06.251 --> 01:43:07.667
but the politicians don't do anything

01:43:07.751 --> 01:43:09.417
because they are thinking
of their elections.

01:43:09.626 --> 01:43:12.959
And the funds collected by
the Cousteau Society will be used

01:43:13.292 --> 01:43:15.834
to produce our future documentaries

01:43:16.084 --> 01:43:20.876
and to raise public awareness
for the need to save nature.

01:43:21.084 --> 01:43:24.167
I believe it will take a widespread
people's movement

01:43:24.251 --> 01:43:26.417
to push the governments
to take the necessary measures

01:43:26.501 --> 01:43:28.209
to protect the planet.

01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:30.792
Now, my son Philippe...

01:43:31.001 --> 01:43:33.042
and myself
will give conferences.

01:43:33.251 --> 01:43:35.667
We will go and meet the people.

01:43:36.167 --> 01:43:39.417
And you believe that the people
will rise to the occasion?

01:43:39.626 --> 01:43:41.376
You see, people think the sea

01:43:41.459 --> 01:43:44.542
is so immense that man
will never be able to destroy it

01:43:44.626 --> 01:43:46.667
and that is a fundamental error.

01:43:47.292 --> 01:43:50.709
One day, we will no longer
be able to swim in the sea.

01:43:50.834 --> 01:43:55.126
Because only the simplest forms of life,
such as bacteria and viruses

01:43:55.292 --> 01:43:57.417
will be able to survive the pollution.

01:43:57.959 --> 01:43:59.584
The longer we wait,

01:43:59.709 --> 01:44:02.876
the poorer the world we want to save
will be.

01:44:20.584 --> 01:44:21.626
Yeah.

01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:24.626
We have the power to act

01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:26.792
as citizens of this world,

01:44:27.209 --> 01:44:30.334
for the sake of our children
and our grandchildren.

01:44:30.751 --> 01:44:32.376
We can change things.

01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:42.501
This is our planet,
and it's the only one we have.

01:44:42.876 --> 01:44:45.334
Man has probably done more damage
to planet Earth

01:44:45.459 --> 01:44:47.542
during the course of the 20th century

01:44:47.667 --> 01:44:50.167
than in all of human history before that.

01:45:23.417 --> 01:45:26.751
We live in an interminable succession

01:45:26.834 --> 01:45:28.126
of absurdities

01:45:28.376 --> 01:45:32.209
imposed by the blind logic
of short-term thinking.

01:45:32.751 --> 01:45:37.042
The demographic explosion.
The divorce of south and north.

01:45:37.251 --> 01:45:40.209
The climatic changes of all sorts.

01:45:40.626 --> 01:45:44.084
The elimination of thousands of species
all over the world.

01:45:44.376 --> 01:45:47.251
The dictatorship of materialism.

01:45:48.209 --> 01:45:52.084
The only cure is the recourse
to utopia!

01:46:05.792 --> 01:46:09.209
Yes, of course I wanna talk to her.
Put her on the phone.

01:47:23.167 --> 01:47:24.209
Daddy?

01:47:32.001 --> 01:47:33.042
Daddy?

01:47:43.251 --> 01:47:44.501
Hello, yes?
