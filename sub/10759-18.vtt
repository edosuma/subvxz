WEBVTT

00:09.442 --> 00:10.443
Dr. Crane.

00:10.443 --> 00:11.444
Hello, Daphne.

00:11.444 --> 00:12.445
Is Dad around?

00:12.445 --> 00:13.947
I have that videotape
he wanted to see.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.682
Actually, he's gone off
with Donny.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.983
They went
to a tractor pull.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.918
Oh...

00:20.320 --> 00:21.788
As I understand it,

00:21.788 --> 00:23.356
they attach a
large weight

00:23.356 --> 00:24.858
to a tractor
and see how far

00:24.858 --> 00:26.126
they can pull it
through the mud.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.428
Oh.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.997
The answer to your
next question is

00:30.997 --> 00:32.866
"Beats the hell
out of me."

00:32.866 --> 00:34.134
(door opens)

00:34.134 --> 00:36.803
Oh, hello, Daphne, Niles.

00:36.803 --> 00:38.605
Hello, Frasier.
Oh, Dr. Crane,

00:38.605 --> 00:41.374
I see you've grown yourself
a crumb catcher.

00:41.374 --> 00:44.144
Oh, please. Spare me
your jocular euphemisms.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.645
I've heard them all from Freddy.

00:45.645 --> 00:49.916
My chin sweater, my face fuzz,
my hickey-hider.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.151
(chuckles)

00:51.151 --> 00:52.152
Well, I think it suits you.

00:52.652 --> 00:53.653
Well, thank you,
Niles.

00:53.653 --> 00:55.455
I just wanted to shake things up
a bit, you know.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.090
How was Boston?

00:57.090 --> 00:57.791
Oh, it was fine.

00:57.791 --> 00:58.858
It was great
seeing Freddy again.

00:58.858 --> 01:00.326
Of course,
Lilith was insufferable,

01:00.326 --> 01:01.828
but she's got a new boyfriend--

01:01.828 --> 01:03.296
some 28-year-old named Marcel.

01:03.296 --> 01:04.798
He's a contortionist

01:04.798 --> 01:07.867
with the Cirque
du Soleil.

01:07.867 --> 01:10.870
She's dating French circus folk?

01:10.870 --> 01:12.138
Yes, well,

01:12.138 --> 01:12.906
he's actually perfect
for Lilith.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.407
He has no apparent spine,

01:14.407 --> 01:16.376
and she can wrap him
around her finger.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.914
Of course, Lilith's
smug satisfaction

01:20.914 --> 01:22.415
was a little hard
to bear, though...

01:22.415 --> 01:23.850
especially considering
how long it's been

01:23.850 --> 01:27.420
since the circus came
to my town.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.388
(door opens)
DONNY: I know.

01:28.388 --> 01:31.357
I couldn't believe
the wheel that thing had...

01:31.357 --> 01:33.359
It's Grizzly Crane.

01:33.359 --> 01:35.295
Well, nice soup strainer
there, Fras.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.229
Thank you.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.664
DONNY: Oh, we just saw a hell
of a tractor pull.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.466
Even you would have liked it.

01:39.466 --> 01:40.900
So, how's
my grandson?

01:40.900 --> 01:41.835
Oh, he's great, Dad.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.503
Actually, he loved
the baseball mitt you sent him.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.305
Where's Daphne?
I got this little gift for her.

01:45.305 --> 01:46.806
Oh, a John Deere cap.

01:46.806 --> 01:50.110
How... could you?

01:50.110 --> 01:50.944
(doorbell rings) Oh, you know,
I'm just giving it to her

01:50.944 --> 01:52.412
to see her pretend
to like it,

01:52.412 --> 01:56.416
and then I'm going to give her
a bracelet.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.917
Hey, Frasier.
Oh, hi, Roz.

01:57.917 --> 01:58.952
Mm, cool beard.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.253
Oh, thanks.
Hey, Niles.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.354
Hey, Roz.

02:01.354 --> 02:02.155
Okay, here's
your directions,

02:02.155 --> 02:03.656
hotel confirmation
and schedule.

02:03.656 --> 02:04.924
Excuse me?

02:04.924 --> 02:06.192
Broadcast conference.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.595
Good Lord, I thought
that was next week.

02:08.595 --> 02:09.662
No, it's tonight.

02:09.662 --> 02:11.097
I'm going up there right now.
Oh, no, Roz.

02:11.097 --> 02:13.099
I just got back from Boston,
for God's sakes.

02:13.099 --> 02:15.668
You know, maybe I can
just drive up tomorrow

02:15.668 --> 02:16.636
and attend the panels.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.171
Frasier,
tonight's reception's

02:18.171 --> 02:19.105
the most
important part.

02:19.105 --> 02:21.174
It sets the tone for
the whole weekend.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.675
Oh, come on, last year,
everybody just got drunk

02:22.675 --> 02:24.444
and acted like a bunch
of horny teenagers.

02:24.444 --> 02:27.647
Exactly, so stop yakking
and start packing.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.017
Well, you know,
it could be

02:31.017 --> 02:32.519
just the boost you
need after a long week

02:32.519 --> 02:35.355
with Lilith and
le Pretzel Boy.
f

02:35.355 --> 02:38.124
You know, come to think
of it, there was

02:38.124 --> 02:40.059
one really gorgeous blonde
up there--

02:40.059 --> 02:43.963
"Rush Hour" Rita,
Laramie's eye in the sky.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.398
Yeah, I remember her.

02:45.398 --> 02:48.334
The traffic was bumper-to-bumper
outside her room.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.270
Meow, Roz.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.137
It's just I
am so sick

02:51.137 --> 02:53.506
of men becoming panting idiots

02:53.506 --> 02:55.808
just at the sight
of blonde hair.

02:55.808 --> 02:56.676
Oh, that's a bit of
an oversimplification.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.178
That's ridiculous.
It's insulting, Roz.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.679
For God sakes,
I mean,

02:59.679 --> 03:01.948
every man's taste
is different.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.249
Sorry. It's just that I met
this guy at Nervosa today

03:03.249 --> 03:05.552
for coffee, and it
was very annoying.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.120
Every time I tried
to say anything,

03:07.120 --> 03:09.322
this blonde waitress
would walk by.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.089
Oh, Mimi's back?

03:10.089 --> 03:11.090
Oh, that's good news.

03:11.090 --> 03:12.392
Got to stop in
to see Mimi.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.560
FRASIER:
You know what?

03:13.560 --> 03:14.561
I guess I better get packing.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.795
MARTIN:
What are you talking about?

03:15.795 --> 03:17.564
You got your bags right there.

03:17.564 --> 03:18.998
No, Dad.
These are my "daddy" clothes.

03:18.998 --> 03:24.003
I have to go and pack
my "Come to Daddy" clothes.

03:24.003 --> 03:24.938
DONNY:
Oh, give me a break.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.372
All right, all right.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.374
My surveillance guy
just canceled for tonight

03:28.374 --> 03:30.376
just when I need him
for this big money divorce case.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.377
Is this the Stanley
Redmond thing?

03:31.377 --> 03:33.179
Yeah. The Dumpster
rental king.

03:33.179 --> 03:34.013
This guy controls

03:34.013 --> 03:35.815
half the Dumpsters
in the Northwest.

03:35.815 --> 03:38.117
His wife thinks he's been taking
out the wrong kind of trash.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.553
Now, you know, if I can
prove it, this case is mine.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.955
That is so depressing.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.457
You expect this sort of behavior
from a mattress king,

03:44.457 --> 03:48.328
but we ask more
of our Dumpster royalty.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.196
Yeah, but, uh,
you should see his girlfriend.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.098
She's gorgeous, leggy, blonde.

03:52.098 --> 03:55.068
Oh, well, blonde.
That explains it.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.569
Good-bye.
I'm sorry.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.470
DONNY:
Hey, wait a minute.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.404
Marty, you were
a cop, right?

03:58.404 --> 03:59.906
You must have
done surveillance.

03:59.906 --> 04:00.907
Oh, sure,
all the time.

04:00.907 --> 04:01.908
Well, why don't you
work for me tonight?

04:01.908 --> 04:02.875
It's 45 bucks
an hour.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.344
Oh, I don't think
Dad would want to do that.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.579
45 bucks?
DONNY: All right, 50.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.847
But if you get a picture
of Redmond and the girl,

04:07.847 --> 04:09.215
there's a $500 bonus.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.416
500 dollars?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.986
All right, $700.
You're killing me here.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.254
Dad, I-I don't think
this is a good idea.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.154
Where exactly is this stakeout?

04:16.154 --> 04:17.557
It's at
the Alcazar Apartments,

04:17.557 --> 04:18.825
you know, in Belltown.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.627
Belltown is, uh,
sort of a sketchy neighborhood,

04:20.627 --> 04:21.494
wouldn't you say?

04:21.494 --> 04:22.862
Oh, Niles, to you,
a sketchy neighborhood

04:22.862 --> 04:25.765
is when the cheese shop
doesn't have valet parking.

04:27.066 --> 04:28.501
I'm an ex-cop, remember?

04:28.501 --> 04:30.303
Yeah, yeah,
I know you're an ex-cop.

04:30.303 --> 04:32.038
Let's just examine this, Dad...

04:32.038 --> 04:32.972
No, no, no, no,
let's just forget about it.

04:32.972 --> 04:34.407
I'm not going to listen
to this all night.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.308
I just won't do it.
Are you satisfied?

04:35.308 --> 04:36.576
Yes.

04:36.576 --> 04:37.644
Thank you.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.412
Donny, I'm sorry
to put

04:39.412 --> 04:40.179
a crimp in your plans.

04:40.179 --> 04:41.514
DONNY:
That's all right.

04:41.514 --> 04:42.715
I'll sure I'll find
somebody else.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.685
You're still doing it,
right?

04:45.685 --> 04:47.687
Hell, yes.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.126
Thanks for watching Alice, Lori.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.161
I really owe you one.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.163
Well, I just want to get
down to this cocktail party

04:57.163 --> 04:59.666
before all the good men
are taken.

04:59.666 --> 05:03.169
What? I just want to have
a little fun tonight.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.172
No, I do not mean that.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.108
All right, I do mean that.

05:09.108 --> 05:11.511
(knock on door)
Uh, Lori, I'll talk to you later.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.012
Thank you again. Bye-bye.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.582
Oh, hey, Frasier.

05:16.582 --> 05:18.084
Hi, Roz. My room
isn't ready yet.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.385
Can I put my stuff here
until I can check in?

05:19.385 --> 05:21.187
Sure. Come on in.
Thanks.

05:21.187 --> 05:22.722
I'll tell you, the
storm hasn't dampened

05:22.722 --> 05:24.557
the festivities
downstairs.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.893
It's only 7:00,
and Marge Whitmeyer

05:26.893 --> 05:29.696
is already in the bar
arm wrestling people for drinks.

05:29.696 --> 05:30.997
How many did you buy her?

05:30.997 --> 05:34.967
Well, three,
but my elbow was in a wet spot.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.469
Hey, did you happen to notice
if that weather guy

05:36.469 --> 05:37.937
from KSGY was there?

05:37.937 --> 05:39.405
Yes, I noticed
that he was there.

05:39.405 --> 05:40.340
Something tells me

05:40.340 --> 05:41.808
the forecast calls
for a collision

05:41.808 --> 05:44.677
between two warm fronts.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.446
(phone ringing)

05:46.446 --> 05:48.314
Oh, excuse me.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.851
Hello?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.119
Oh, yeah, he's here.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.721
Front desk.

05:54.721 --> 05:57.023
Great, thanks. Hello.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.524
Yes.

05:58.524 --> 06:02.295
Well, then, you'll just have
to get me a room elsewhere.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.564
I see.

06:04.564 --> 06:07.066
Thank you very much.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.370
They don't have a room for me.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.506
What are you going to do?

06:15.341 --> 06:18.344
Well... I guess I could stay
on the couch.

06:18.344 --> 06:19.245
What?

06:19.245 --> 06:20.713
Oh, come on, Roz.
I got no choice.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.081
The whole island
is booked.

06:22.081 --> 06:23.916
Well, this sure is going
to cramp my style.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.419
I mean, it's not like college
when everybody just...

06:26.419 --> 06:29.288
Never mind.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.190
You know, Roz,
we're two attractive people.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.693
We're at a conference that turns
into a bacchanal every year.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.095
Odds are, neither of us
will need this room tonight.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.831
You're right.
What's the problem?

06:38.831 --> 06:41.501
I believe there's
a cocktail party awaiting us.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.269
Let's go down together.

06:43.269 --> 06:44.771
We'll be like jackals.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.272
They hunt in pairs.

06:46.272 --> 06:48.107
I like your
self-assurance.

06:48.107 --> 06:49.442
There's no greater
aphrodisiac

06:49.442 --> 06:50.777
than confidence.
Shall we?

06:50.777 --> 06:53.613
Let the games begin.

06:56.115 --> 06:57.617
I just need
a little more lipstick.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.119
I'm sweating
right through this shirt.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:22.675 --> 07:24.010
Niles...

07:24.010 --> 07:25.511
You specifically
promised me...

07:25.511 --> 07:27.346
Oh, would you shut up
and get in here?

07:30.183 --> 07:31.651
How did you know
I was here?

07:31.651 --> 07:32.685
The doorman.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.153
Big mouth.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.588
Oh, well,
I guess he didn't realize

07:35.588 --> 07:37.089
he was being sworn to secrecy
when you said,

07:37.089 --> 07:40.359
"Hey, Sid,
I'm going on a stakeout."

07:42.995 --> 07:44.697
I can't believe you lied to me.

07:44.697 --> 07:46.065
Well, I'm sorry,
but you were making

07:46.065 --> 07:47.567
such a big fuss about nothing.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.068
It is not nothing.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.069
Look at this
neighborhood.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.071
I'm not even happy parking
my Mercedes here.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.573
It's not that bad.

07:53.573 --> 07:54.540
Oh, really?

07:54.540 --> 07:57.043
Well, then, could
you explain to me

07:57.043 --> 07:58.044
the ominous
group of men

07:58.044 --> 08:00.046
standing back there in
the shadows by my car?

08:00.046 --> 08:01.047
They're all wearing

08:01.047 --> 08:02.048
the same sort
of dark coat.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.449
It's some
sort of gang.

08:03.449 --> 08:06.853
Niles, they're Hasidic Jews.

08:07.854 --> 08:11.357
That's right.
Keep walking, keep walking.

08:12.658 --> 08:16.395
So, what, did you come
down here to bawl me out?

08:16.395 --> 08:18.331
Yes... partly.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.232
(sirens blaring
in the distance)

08:19.232 --> 08:20.733
Also to give
you this.

08:20.733 --> 08:21.734
What's this?

08:21.734 --> 08:23.603
Clam chowder.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.404
(laughing)

08:25.404 --> 08:26.405
I remembered Mom
made it for you

08:26.405 --> 08:27.406
when you went
ice fishing,

08:27.406 --> 08:28.908
and I hated the
thought of you

08:28.908 --> 08:30.910
sitting out here
cold and hungry.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.745
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.580
But, look, why don't
you just go back home?

08:34.580 --> 08:35.548
I'll be fine.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.482
No, I can stay
for a while.

08:36.482 --> 08:37.482
No, really.
I'll be fine.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.385
No, no, you can use the company.
Oh, come on, Niles,

08:39.385 --> 08:41.787
why don't you tell me
what's really on your mind?

08:41.787 --> 08:44.557
All right, Dad.
I was worried about you.

08:44.557 --> 08:45.825
I knew it.
Because I'm an old man

08:45.825 --> 08:48.160
and I can't take care of myself.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.098
No. Age has nothing
to do with it.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.599
I've always
worried about you.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.102
That's what it's like
when your father's a cop.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.571
I worried about you when
I was five years old.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.306
I didn't stop
worrying

09:00.306 --> 09:01.574
until the day you retired,

09:01.574 --> 09:04.477
and today just brought
it all back again.

09:05.411 --> 09:07.346
Look, I'm sorry.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.017
For what it's worth,
I know what you mean.

09:11.017 --> 09:12.852
My dad was a cop, too.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.220
I know.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.054
But you know, Niles,

09:15.054 --> 09:16.422
I'm not chasing after bad guys.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.357
I'm just going
to take a picture.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.792
That's true.

09:19.792 --> 09:23.296
I'm... probably overreacting
like usual.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.798
Uh... well,
I guess I'll head home.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.300
No, no. Hey, hey.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.802
Wait a little bit.
Stick around.

09:29.802 --> 09:32.071
How would you like
a little clam chowder?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.773
I'd love some.
Okay.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.610
This is clam chowder!

09:37.610 --> 09:38.911
Well, what did you expect?

09:38.911 --> 09:42.014
Irish whiskey!

09:42.014 --> 09:43.282
Your mother

09:43.282 --> 09:45.284
always filled it
with coffee and Irish whiskey.

09:45.284 --> 09:48.020
We just called it clam chowder
in front of you kids.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.827
Is that why you got so mad

09:54.827 --> 09:58.130
that day I crumbled
oyster crackers in your thermos?

10:04.737 --> 10:06.739
(sighs):
What happened to you?

10:06.739 --> 10:08.040
The same thing that
happened to you.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.310
I got a hug good night.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.612
Where did we go wrong?

10:12.612 --> 10:16.349
Rush Hour Rita was draping
herself all over you.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.817
And that news guy
actually said to me

10:17.817 --> 10:20.786
if I gave him 22 minutes,
he'd give me the world.

10:22.755 --> 10:25.758
I, uh... I
don't know, Roz.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.727
After he gave you
the brush-off,

10:27.727 --> 10:30.763
he came over and sat down
next to me and Rita.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.264
Before I knew it,
they had discovered

10:32.264 --> 10:36.268
their mutual fondness
for tango music.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.671
ROZ:
Oh...

10:38.671 --> 10:41.040
I lose out to tango music?

10:41.040 --> 10:43.376
What a night. A total bust.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.710
Oh, come on, Roz.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.711
You know,
for my money,

10:45.711 --> 10:48.214
you were the most
attractive woman down there.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.715
Thanks, Frasier.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.217
And I'm not
just saying this

10:51.217 --> 10:52.184
to return the favor,

10:52.184 --> 10:54.520
but you look really hot
in that beard.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.423
Oh, well... thanks.

10:57.423 --> 10:58.924
Well, you know,
maybe we're better off.

10:58.924 --> 11:02.795
Just a couple of old friends
having a cozy evening together.

11:02.795 --> 11:03.629
Yeah, right.

11:03.629 --> 11:04.630
(knock on door)

11:04.630 --> 11:05.631
It's him!
It's her!

11:05.631 --> 11:07.133
All right.
All right.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.803
Come in.
Hello.

11:10.803 --> 11:11.604
Oh.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.905
Sorry to
disturb you,

11:12.905 --> 11:14.707
but the manager wanted
to apologize

11:14.707 --> 11:17.043
for the mix-up with the room.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.310
This is on us.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.845
That's nice.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.347
Well, uh,
you in the mood

11:21.347 --> 11:22.848
for a glass
of champers, Roz?

11:22.848 --> 11:23.783
I don't know.
What do you think?

11:23.783 --> 11:26.152
It won't fit in the mini-bar.

11:26.152 --> 11:27.586
Well, it's settled, then.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.588
Uh, I can open it myself.

11:29.588 --> 11:30.589
Thanks. Here you are.

11:30.589 --> 11:31.590
Thank you.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.593
Well...

11:35.094 --> 11:38.097
Ah, demi-sec,
respectable label.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.932
Not a bad year.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.767
We may just be
having a better time

11:41.767 --> 11:43.769
than anybody else here.

11:43.769 --> 11:47.039
(tango music playing upstairs)

11:55.881 --> 11:59.719
(shouting):
Dad, this thing is amazing!

11:59.719 --> 12:04.023
I can actually hear some guy
brushing his teeth.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.860
Swish, swish, spit.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.531
Swish, swish...

12:12.531 --> 12:14.500
(gasps):
Flossing!

12:15.534 --> 12:16.969
Niles!

12:16.969 --> 12:19.438
You have...
got to try this.

12:19.438 --> 12:20.940
It's incredible!
Here, put those on.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.942
All right.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.877
All right, now point
that anywhere you want.

12:24.877 --> 12:25.845
(horn honking)

12:25.845 --> 12:28.214
(screams)

12:31.484 --> 12:33.452
Niles, will you quit
kidding around?!

12:33.452 --> 12:35.454
This isn't a game.
It's a job.

12:35.454 --> 12:36.455
I just want
to spot the guy,

12:36.956 --> 12:38.257
get a picture
and get out of here,

12:38.257 --> 12:41.560
so why don't we just sit here
and be quiet for a while?

12:47.666 --> 12:49.068
You know, Dad...

12:49.068 --> 12:50.836
are you sure you want
to be doing this?

12:50.836 --> 12:54.006
I thought you said
you weren't worried about me.

12:54.006 --> 12:54.874
No-no, I'm not worried
about your safety.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.343
I just mean, are you doing
the right thing,

12:57.343 --> 12:59.545
meddling in this
guy's marriage?

12:59.545 --> 13:01.247
You know, speaking
as a psychiatrist...

13:01.247 --> 13:04.116
Oh, boy, open up a window.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.519
I just see this
sort of thing

13:06.519 --> 13:08.020
in my practice
all the time.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.889
People make mistakes
an-and have affairs

13:09.889 --> 13:12.625
and then find
some way to fix it.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.460
It's possible that by
taking this picture,

13:14.460 --> 13:16.829
you're destroying any
chance this man has.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.197
Niles, the guy's a bum.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.032
He's probably always been a bum.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.867
Now, if you want to get
into a debate about something,

13:21.867 --> 13:23.836
maybe you can tell me
what those grass clippings

13:23.836 --> 13:25.638
were doing in the clam chowder.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.941
That was lemongrass...

13:28.941 --> 13:32.845
and Chef Andre has gotten
high kudos for that soup.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.747
Well, if kudos are
those brown chewy things,

13:34.747 --> 13:35.748
he can have them.

13:35.748 --> 13:36.649
I put mine in the ashtray.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.088
You pretend to
be such a cynic.

13:43.088 --> 13:44.557
I think you
agree with me.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.592
You have too much of
a conscience not to.

13:46.592 --> 13:49.094
Aw, babbity babbity bap.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.230
Oh, there they are.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.731
You're still going
to take this picture?

13:52.731 --> 13:54.733
Oh, you're damn right
I am.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.735
Even though right now,
that man may be planning

13:56.735 --> 13:58.604
to break it off with
his girlfriend tonight,

13:58.604 --> 14:01.307
planning to-to rededicate
himself to his marriage,

14:01.307 --> 14:03.542
the terrible guilt
spurring him on

14:03.542 --> 14:04.476
to ever-greater depths
of commitment,

14:04.476 --> 14:05.978
an-and-and years from now,

14:05.978 --> 14:08.981
he may be sitting with his wife
by the fire, holding her hand,

14:08.981 --> 14:11.884
reflecting on all their
wonderful years together--

14:11.884 --> 14:13.319
especially their
sunset years--

14:13.319 --> 14:16.322
and you could
destroy all of that

14:16.322 --> 14:18.824
with one click
of a camera.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.327
(shutter clicking rapidly)

14:21.327 --> 14:24.597
Sorry, Niles.
What were you saying?

14:24.597 --> 14:27.366
You took a picture
of that tree,

14:27.366 --> 14:29.134
and you know it.
All right, I did.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.403
What'd you have to talk
about all that stuff for?

14:31.403 --> 14:33.272
I was just saying what
you were already thinking.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.574
You did the right thing and
you're not going to regret it.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.042
Oh, yeah? Well,
how am I going to tell Donny

14:37.042 --> 14:38.944
I just sat here and watched them
walk by and get in the car?

14:38.944 --> 14:39.845
You'll tell
him proudly

14:39.845 --> 14:41.347
because you know
in your hearts...

14:41.347 --> 14:43.349
(crash)
(car alarm blaring)

14:43.349 --> 14:45.851
Whoa! They backed
into your Mercedes.

14:45.851 --> 14:49.221
I don't believe it.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.556
They're not even leaving a note.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.524
They're driving away.

14:52.524 --> 14:53.492
Well, I wouldn't worry
about it, Niles.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.927
They're probably wracked
with grief,

14:55.494 --> 14:56.428
and it'll spur them on to...

14:56.428 --> 14:58.264
Oh, shut up
and take that picture.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.164
Hurry up, get their
license plate number!

14:59.164 --> 15:01.667
Hurry! Hurry!

15:04.603 --> 15:07.539
Um... my longest relationship

15:07.539 --> 15:10.609
would have to be Ted--
'88 to '90.

15:10.609 --> 15:13.612
No, Derrick--
'89 to '92.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.383
Being a gentleman, Roz,
I won't point out

15:17.383 --> 15:19.885
the slight overlap there.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.388
It's not an overlap.
It's a transition.

15:22.388 --> 15:23.889
Uh-huh.
You know, like in April,

15:23.889 --> 15:25.891
when you start wearing
your spring clothes

15:25.891 --> 15:27.860
even though you're still
wearing your winter stuff?

15:27.860 --> 15:28.827
Yeah, well, if we're talking
April of '90,

15:29.328 --> 15:30.796
I doubt if you were wearing
much of anything at all.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.766
Okay, wise guy...

15:33.766 --> 15:35.768
what was your
longest relationship?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.771
Oh, that's
easy-- Lilith.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.772
Lilith.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.773
Although...

15:40.773 --> 15:42.675
(chuckling)

15:42.675 --> 15:44.076
What?

15:44.076 --> 15:44.944
Well...

15:44.944 --> 15:46.812
if we're not talking
romantic relationship,

15:46.812 --> 15:48.814
well, then, uh...

15:48.814 --> 15:51.817
my longest relationship
with a woman would be you.

15:52.318 --> 15:53.752
Seven years.

15:53.752 --> 15:54.620
Loser.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.156
(laughing)

15:57.156 --> 15:58.157
Yeah.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.658
Seven years...

15:59.658 --> 16:02.161
Gosh. My God,
it has been that long.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.629
It's worth toasting.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.663
Absolutely.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.065
(chuckles)

16:07.433 --> 16:09.935
So, Frasier,
what's with the beard?

16:10.936 --> 16:12.271
You hate it.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.572
No. Actually, I like it.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.008
It's like you're Frasier,
but you're not Frasier.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.977
What made you do it?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.845
Oh, I don't know,
you know, I just...

16:19.845 --> 16:21.714
wanted to change things a little
or something--

16:21.714 --> 16:23.515
I don't know-- be spontaneous.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.250
Oh, my God, I almost did
something like that

16:25.250 --> 16:26.719
this weekend.
FRASIER: Really?

16:26.719 --> 16:28.187
Yeah, I...

16:28.187 --> 16:30.189
Oh, hell,
I'll show you.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.691
Ooh, nice silk pajamas.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.193
I made a little
purchase

16:34.193 --> 16:35.594
on my way up here.
Did you?

16:35.594 --> 16:37.963
Well, I am just dying
with anticipation.

16:37.963 --> 16:38.964
What is it?

16:38.964 --> 16:39.965
ROZ: But you promise
you won't laugh?

16:40.466 --> 16:41.233
I promise.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.535
ROZ:
Okay. Hold on one second.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.838
I'll be right out.

16:54.913 --> 16:55.814
(sighs)

16:55.814 --> 16:57.816
I just wanted to see
for once in my life

16:57.816 --> 16:59.618
what it'd be like
to be a blonde.

16:59.618 --> 17:02.421
I thought I'd wear
it down to the bar one night.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.390
(chuckling)

17:04.390 --> 17:06.825
Pretty pathetic, huh?

17:06.825 --> 17:11.630
On the contrary, Roz,
it's-it's... quite becoming.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.700
It's like you're...

17:14.700 --> 17:17.970
Roz but not Roz.

17:19.905 --> 17:23.809
Hello, stranger.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.810
You here for
the conference?

17:25.810 --> 17:27.212
Yes, I am.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.548
Is this seat taken?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.818
It's been waiting for you
all its life.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.155
Champagne?

17:36.155 --> 17:38.624
Well, I'm not
sure I should.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.860
I already had one glass,
and it went straight to my head.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.264
I feel like maybe
I should lie down.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.166
You could use
my room.

17:47.166 --> 17:50.102
Are you sure you're a gentleman?

17:50.102 --> 17:53.472
Well, I do prefer blondes.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.874
(both laughing)

17:55.874 --> 17:57.376
God, how many times

17:57.376 --> 17:58.877
have I had that
conversation?

17:58.877 --> 18:01.747
(both chuckling)

18:01.747 --> 18:02.614
What would life be

18:02.614 --> 18:05.551
without the occasional
surrender to impulse?

18:05.551 --> 18:08.353
It's true.
It does make you feel alive.

18:08.353 --> 18:11.290
Doing things you know
you shouldn't do.

18:11.290 --> 18:14.226
With people you
shouldn't be with.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.663
Right.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.701
Right.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.540
You know, suddenly...

18:28.540 --> 18:32.044
this couch seems
a little small for me.

18:33.011 --> 18:35.914
Well, the bed seems pretty big.

18:35.914 --> 18:38.851
It's a big bed.

18:41.987 --> 18:44.323
It is.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.265
Roz...

18:53.265 --> 18:55.000
(knocking at door)

18:55.000 --> 18:57.302
For God's sake.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.441
Are you all right?

19:02.441 --> 19:03.375
Yeah.
FRASIER: Okay. All right.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.244
Hello...

19:05.744 --> 19:06.245
Kenny?

19:06.745 --> 19:07.546
I got stuck
in the storm.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.381
Now they don't have
a room for me.

19:09.381 --> 19:10.716
I hear we're in the
same boat, huh, Doc?

19:10.716 --> 19:12.184
Oh, hey, Roz.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.585
Hey.
Hey, cool wig.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.354
Thanks.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.189
KENNY:
Hey, wait a minute.

19:17.189 --> 19:20.425
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

19:20.425 --> 19:21.226
(laughing)

19:21.226 --> 19:23.695
Pajamas,
champagne... No...

19:23.695 --> 19:25.564
a fire.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.299
(laughing)

19:27.299 --> 19:30.969
So, uh, anyhow, uh,
can I bunk here?

19:30.969 --> 19:31.703
Why not?

19:31.703 --> 19:32.571
No reason, yeah.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.572
Great, great.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.041
Yeah, I really like
that blond hair, Roz.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.576
You'd better be careful,
though.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.578
Get the doc here all
hot and bothered.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.313
(laughing)

19:41.313 --> 19:44.516
Well...

19:44.516 --> 19:46.385
I'm just going to get
out of these wet clothes.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.854
I had a heck of a
time getting here.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.790
All these roads
look the same.

19:51.790 --> 19:55.527
I ended up taking
a wrong turn.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.828
The last thing you
want to do out here

19:56.828 --> 20:00.332
in these woods is
take a wrong turn.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.103
Quite right, Kenny.

20:09.107 --> 20:10.442
You know...

20:10.442 --> 20:12.811
I'm not sure
the beard's really working.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.614
I... probably should
shave it off.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.816
I wasn't going to say anything,
but, yeah.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.017
Yeah.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.821
(sighs)

20:25.324 --> 20:27.326
I don't wear one of
these snore strips,

20:27.326 --> 20:30.229
I'm a buzz saw going
through steel pipe.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.897
So, uh...

20:31.897 --> 20:33.232
Rock-Paper-Scissors
for the sofa?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.234
I'll take it.
Okay.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.736
Looks like it's you and me
in the bed, Doc...

20:37.736 --> 20:39.238
Okay.

20:39.238 --> 20:43.742
But I warn you,
I'm a roller.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.747
What was I thinking

20:48.747 --> 20:50.249
drinking all that coffee
on the way up here?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.750
I'm going to be up
all night.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.254
I am wired.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.258
Uh, Kenny, do you
think you could...

20:59.258 --> 21:02.227
(snoring)

21:04.129 --> 21:06.465
Good night, Frasier.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.267
Good night, Roz.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.102
