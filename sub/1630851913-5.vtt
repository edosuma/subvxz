[in Spanish] Perhaps we should use
the rear entrance, Mr. President?

00:56.931 --> 00:58.516
[Andréa in English] <i>Before 1993,</i>

00:59.184 --> 01:02.812
<i>a Mexican president hadn't</i>
<i>officially visited a Catholic Church</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:06.357
<i>since Benito Juárez' reform</i>
<i>separated Church and State</i>

01:06.441 --> 01:07.734
<i>back in the 1800s.</i>

01:08.943 --> 01:11.529
<i>So when the president visited</i>
<i>the Guadalajara Cathedral</i>

01:11.613 --> 01:13.198
<i>for Cardinal Posadas' funeral…</i>

01:14.657 --> 01:19.120
<i>most of us saw it as a sign</i>
<i>of just how bad things were.</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:22.665
<i>Mexico was hurting.</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:25.543
<i>People wanted answers.</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:28.630
[Salinas in Spanish]
My deepest condolences.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.882
-My condolences.
-[Father Baiz] Thank you.

01:30.965 --> 01:34.135
[Sandoval] The Pope holds Mexico
in his prayers, Mr. President.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.139
He hopes justice will be served
here in Mexico…

01:39.599 --> 01:43.186
as do millions of faithful Catholics.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.562
[Salinas] Of course.

01:45.688 --> 01:50.360
I'd like to show my respects now,

01:50.443 --> 01:51.694
in silence.

01:51.778 --> 01:58.118
His Holy Father also prays those who have
<i>neglected</i> their oaths of duty will,

01:58.660 --> 02:00.745
at last,

02:01.579 --> 02:04.374

02:06.501 --> 02:07.627
Here I am,

02:07.710 --> 02:11.089
starting to sound like a politician.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.386
Perhaps the upcoming election's

02:18.805 --> 02:20.807
Please… excuse us…

02:20.890 --> 02:22.142
Excuse us.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.612
[Andréa in English] <i>A dead cardinal</i>

<i>Give me enough strength so I can</i>

Those fucking Tijuana sons of bitches!

03:28.833 --> 03:33.755
<i>…who is considered</i>
<i>the most pernicious of the four.</i>

03:34.464 --> 03:35.840
They were trying to kill me.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.593
I didn't touch the Cardinal -
did I, Arturo?

03:38.676 --> 03:41.095
[man] <i>Which is why we're offering</i>

03:41.179 --> 03:44.057

03:50.188 --> 03:53.483
The government just declared war
on Tijuana and Sinaloa, kid.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.320
Nobody gives a fuck about the truth.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.949
[opening theme song playing]

05:28.494 --> 05:30.246
[man 1 in English] DC and Mexico
are calling it

05:30.330 --> 05:32.915
a joint intelligence group task force.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.500
Mexican army's in charge,

05:34.584 --> 05:36.794
setting up a command center
outside Tijuana.

05:36.878 --> 05:41.215
Plan is to go after the perpetrators
of the Guadalajara airport massacre.

05:41.299 --> 05:45.094
A Mexican carnival
paid for by Uncle Sam. Nice.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.722
Administrator wants us
helping out where we can,

05:47.805 --> 05:50.975
so every DEA office on the border
will be assigned an agent

05:51.059 --> 05:53.853
who will coordinate intel
with the Mexicans in Tijuana.

05:53.936 --> 05:57.190
[man 2] Nine times out of ten, Mexico
won't return our fucking phone calls.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.526
US isn't asking for the intel, Mexico is.

06:03.112 --> 06:05.198
Keeps his mouth shut
for the rest of this briefing,

06:05.281 --> 06:08.159
I'll buy Sheridan a lap dance
at that place he likes on South Mesa.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.285
[laughter]

06:10.953 --> 06:13.122
-I have some time. I'll take care of it.
-[man 1] Thanks, Bobby.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.626
Oh, and DC's putting a DEA agent
on the ground in Tijuana,

06:16.709 --> 06:18.294
working with the Mexicans.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.587
[Bobby] Who's in charge down there?

06:20.755 --> 06:24.008
[man 1] General Jesús Hector Rebollo.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.764
He collared Carrillo Fuentes
when his plane went down in Chihuahua.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.141
Rebollo torched his coke
and a million in cash.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.434
What the fuck's wrong with him?

06:33.518 --> 06:36.145
Seems like Mexico's
taking action, finally.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.397
This could be a chance for DEA
to grab some shine.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.235
Mexico City and DC
are backing Rebollo. Hard.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.782
That's all I got. Get back to work.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.001

07:47.467 --> 07:48.759
Me, too.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.515
Wish I could go with you.

07:56.893 --> 07:57.727
You're my queen.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.105
Love you.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.064
Hmm.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.702
[Beltran] Hey, cuz.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.040
Money's here. We gotta move fast.

08:19.624 --> 08:20.708
Guatemalans came through?

08:20.791 --> 08:23.169
Yep. Meeting us at the border.

Thanks for the meal, best in Sinaloa
as always. May God bless you.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.681
-[Loera] Take care.
-I'll be in the car.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.766
Señorita…

08:42.396 --> 08:43.648
It's time, Mom.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.442
I need to go now.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.572
The Lord protects all his children.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.200
In darkness and light.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.831
Don't forget where you come from, son.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.676
Take care, Mom.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.335
You're all over TV, man. Shit's <i>serious.</i>

09:46.419 --> 09:48.588

Now's the time to use them.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.137

[Francisco] So we wait for your country
club friends to clear our name?

09:59.307 --> 10:00.725
[Benjamín] No one's waiting, Pancho.

10:01.642 --> 10:05.229
Barron's got two guys
turning themselves in for the Cardinal.

Want you there with me.

10:28.502 --> 10:31.213
Listen. We're gonna be okay.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.050
Fuck. Maybe better than before.

10:44.393 --> 10:45.978

10:46.062 --> 10:46.896
[baggage attendant] Excuse me?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.939
[Andréa] The shooting.
Were you here? It was intense.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.566
[baggage attendant] Yeah, it was crazy.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.193
[bell rings]

10:52.276 --> 10:56.656
[baggage attendant] I was outside.
Loading bags. When the shooting started.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.243
See any of the gunmen?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.828
Couldn't see anything.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.954
Guess I was lucky.

11:04.038 --> 11:04.872
[scoffs]

11:04.955 --> 11:06.374
Yeah. Lucky.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.961
Plane I was loading got held at the gate.

11:11.796 --> 11:15.675
Tower hold all flights
while the shooting was going on?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.676
No. Just mine.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.638
-Okay.
-[baggage attendant] Yeah. But…

11:21.347 --> 11:23.474
it wasn't the tower. It was police.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.560
Cops showed up pretty quick.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.856
They were guarding the cabin door,
waiting for someone to board.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.025
Plane was headed…

11:34.819 --> 11:35.903
To Tijuana.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.072
-Tijuana?
-[baggage attendant] Yeah.

11:38.155 --> 11:41.075
Didn't see the guys who boarded.
But they must be important.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.702
TAESA never waits for anyone.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.872
Well, I gotta go. More work to do…

11:48.165 --> 11:49.542

I checked for security cameras,
there were two.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.061
Just need to get a comment from TAESA.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.980
Be back in Tijuana tonight.

[car doors closing]

32:45.588 --> 32:47.215
[engines starting]

32:53.304 --> 32:54.514
Are you high?

32:58.226 --> 32:59.686
Not really.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.357
I'm worried about Benjamín.

33:11.906 --> 33:14.117
[Walt in English] This it? It's just us?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.201
[Providencio in Spanish] Wait here.

33:15.284 --> 33:18.663
Less local cops know
about the task force, the better.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.456
"Milk run"?

33:21.124 --> 33:22.041
[Enrique] A what run?

33:22.125 --> 33:25.503
General Rebollo ordered us
to pick up two suspects.

33:25.586 --> 33:26.754
[in English] That's what this is.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.508
No, it's not. Two transports were idling
outside the base.

33:30.591 --> 33:31.509
There must have been 20 guys--

33:31.592 --> 33:32.719
[in Spanish] Watch the vehicle.

33:32.802 --> 33:34.012
[in English] Where the fuck are they?

33:35.054 --> 33:36.472
[in Spanish] Not here.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.769
[in English] Fuck.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.665
Your guys, turning themselves in…

34:02.749 --> 34:03.916
They know what to say?

34:04.792 --> 34:05.877
They're solid?

34:08.171 --> 34:10.298
I grew up with their older brothers.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.216
They're solid.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.761
Good.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.606
[woman] We're late again. Here…

35:10.483 --> 35:11.484

35:12.485 --> 35:14.821

36:26.893 --> 36:27.727
[Fausto] <i>No, Father.</i>

36:28.311 --> 36:31.230
You're doing the right thing,
but he needs to come <i>inside.</i>

36:42.742 --> 36:44.452
[soldier over radio] <i>Target spotted.</i>

36:44.535 --> 36:46.579

36:48.372 --> 36:49.749

36:50.583 --> 36:52.210
Prepare to engage.

36:53.252 --> 36:54.629
Stay in the truck.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.194
[Fausto] Go now!

38:01.112 --> 38:02.113
Go, go!

38:02.196 --> 38:03.197
[gunshots]

38:04.865 --> 38:05.741
[soldier 1] Block the road!

38:06.367 --> 38:07.410
Block the road!

38:07.493 --> 38:08.494
[soldier 2] Cut 'em off!

Let's go!

39:30.868 --> 39:31.702
Benjamín!

39:37.500 --> 39:38.876
You have to run, Benjamín!

39:38.959 --> 39:40.086
Let's go!

39:46.801 --> 39:47.885
Let's roll!

39:59.271 --> 40:03.150
General, target's on the move.
Permission to pursue.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.195
<i>Sir! Permission to pursue?</i>

40:07.113 --> 40:08.197
[sighs]

40:08.906 --> 40:10.324
They're outside the secure zone.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.284
Do not pursue.

40:13.452 --> 40:14.495
Hold your fire.

40:15.579 --> 40:18.082
Stop! Stop!

40:18.165 --> 40:20.209
Do not pursue. I repeat, do not pursue.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.170
[in English] Why aren't you
going after him?

40:23.254 --> 40:24.130
General's orders.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.383
Fucking kidding me.

40:30.678 --> 40:31.720
[laughing and cheering]

40:31.804 --> 40:32.972
[in Spanish] Fuck them!

40:34.056 --> 40:37.017
Fuck yeah, Benjamín.
They can go fuck themselves!

40:37.101 --> 40:39.270
[Kitty] We fucked 'em up, bro!

40:39.353 --> 40:40.396
Whoo!

40:40.479 --> 40:41.564
[laughing maniacally]

40:44.817 --> 40:45.860
Whoo!

40:45.943 --> 40:48.195
Move this thing! Go, go, go!

40:54.702 --> 40:56.120
[Rogelio] What's up, Blue?

40:56.203 --> 40:58.456
What do they call your sister again?

40:59.165 --> 41:00.332
[laughing]

41:01.625 --> 41:03.002
Fucking Blue.

41:03.627 --> 41:04.462
Bro.

41:05.421 --> 41:06.255
Bro.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.383
What's up? You good, man?

41:10.426 --> 41:13.012
-Yeah, I'm cool.
-Dreaming about Blue's sister's ass?

41:13.095 --> 41:13.929
[all laughing]

41:14.638 --> 41:16.724
That ass is unforgettable.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.584
[Salgado] Just got off the phone.

42:27.962 --> 42:31.048
Army almost caught
Benjamín Arellano Félix.

42:34.051 --> 42:35.719
No more country club weddings.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.431
Progress, isn't it?

42:41.892 --> 42:44.270
Things are going to get worse in Tijuana.

42:46.146 --> 42:47.273
All over Mexico.

42:49.358 --> 42:52.778
Men like Hank won't give up power
till it's taken from them.

43:09.712 --> 43:10.629
[Ruth sobbing]

43:34.111 --> 43:35.571
[Benjamín] <i>Ruth's packing.</i>

43:37.364 --> 43:39.116
She was really scared, Benjamín.

43:48.208 --> 43:51.337
I wanted to turn this into something
no one could ever take away from us.

43:53.714 --> 43:54.548
I know.

44:06.393 --> 44:07.436
You were right.

44:14.568 --> 44:17.946
Francisco's smart, but he's not you.

44:26.121 --> 44:28.916
You can handle things here,
while I'm gone.

44:35.589 --> 44:38.759
I'll do whatever I have to
to keep this family safe.

44:39.718 --> 44:40.761
I promise.

44:51.814 --> 44:54.024
It all got fucked up.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.122
I never wanted this for you.

45:31.145 --> 45:34.356
[in English] My point is,
letting Benjamín Arellano go

45:34.440 --> 45:36.191
makes us look weak and uncommitted.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.401
Us or you?

45:37.484 --> 45:39.862
I gave an assignment.
You didn't find it interesting.

45:39.945 --> 45:42.573
[Walt] With all due respect,
that assignment was bullshit, sir.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.785
It is very American of you.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.955
You had him boxed in.
You had over a dozen guys there.

45:50.038 --> 45:51.748
-You had military--
-Filling the streets

45:51.832 --> 45:55.669
with dead civilians will do nothing
to stop drug trafficking. Nothing.

45:57.963 --> 46:01.592
We offered 15 million pesos
for information on Chapo Guzmán.

46:03.135 --> 46:05.679
More money than people can make here
in a lifetime.

46:07.431 --> 46:08.765
No one came forward.

46:10.559 --> 46:13.479
-Why?
-'Cause they don't trust the government.

46:15.981 --> 46:19.735
So, how are men like you and me,
Agent Breslin…

46:21.028 --> 46:23.238
How are we to fight
that kind of thinking, huh?

46:24.865 --> 46:25.949
With more bullets?

46:27.659 --> 46:29.036
People are going to get hurt.

46:29.661 --> 46:31.205
That's the reality of it, sir.

46:33.332 --> 46:34.166
Let's be honest.

46:35.751 --> 46:38.587
Your government would not be
supporting this operation

46:39.296 --> 46:41.632
if NAFTA were not on the horizon.

46:42.716 --> 46:43.717
And neither would mine.

46:46.094 --> 46:49.181
A famous cardinal getting killed
in cartel cross fire…

46:50.224 --> 46:52.601
That is simply bad for the trade deal.

46:54.311 --> 46:56.688
Yeah. I imagine it might be.

46:57.397 --> 46:59.399
So this whole operation

47:00.108 --> 47:01.276
is political.

47:02.569 --> 47:04.154
Which means it will not last.

47:05.489 --> 47:06.406
But while it does,

47:07.115 --> 47:11.286
I'm not just gonna go after the men
responsible for the cardinal's murder,

47:12.079 --> 47:15.916
I'm going after
all the drug traffickers in Mexico.

47:15.999 --> 47:17.876
Every single one of them.

47:19.211 --> 47:20.045
To do that,

47:20.712 --> 47:23.340
I need the Mexican people at my side.

47:25.467 --> 47:27.469
That's why I'm here, Agent Breslin.

47:29.513 --> 47:30.597
Now, why are you?

47:36.144 --> 47:37.813
It's my job, sir.

47:38.647 --> 47:39.481
Yes.

47:40.566 --> 47:43.527
You said you like action.

47:49.074 --> 47:49.908
[sighs]

47:49.992 --> 47:51.243
If there is nothing else…

48:20.105 --> 48:21.773
I was raised Presbyterian.

48:22.608 --> 48:23.567
Didn't really stick.

48:26.653 --> 48:28.614
I'm willing to get you whatever you need.

48:30.365 --> 48:33.035
I can get you whatever you want.
You just gotta tell me.

48:36.747 --> 48:37.748
[sighs]

48:40.459 --> 48:42.419
We lost Benjamín Arellano.

48:44.880 --> 48:49.593
But a few hours ago, El Chapo Guzmán
was arrested at the Guatemalan border.

48:52.429 --> 48:53.555
He's in custody?

48:55.641 --> 48:56.933
How the hell did that happen?

48:58.226 --> 49:01.647
The officers who cut a deal
to hide Guzmán…

49:03.357 --> 49:05.942
turned right around and sold him to us.

49:11.865 --> 49:14.117
Sometimes, greed works, too.

[Andréa] <i>In June of '93,</i>

49:36.723 --> 49:40.227

No, sir.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.794

[Andréa in English] <i>His arrest and</i>

Corn, beans.
