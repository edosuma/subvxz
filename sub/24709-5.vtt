00:36.119 --> 00:37.495
PASSER-BY
CALLED IT IN.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.830
GOT WITNESSES?

00:38.913 --> 00:40.665
ONE LADY SAW 2 BLACK KIDS
RUNNIN' FROM THE SCENE,

00:40.749 --> 00:42.625
BUT SHE DIDN'T SEE
THEIR FACES.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.590
THIS IS
MY FATHER'S STORE!
WHO'S THIS?

00:48.673 --> 00:50.592
THAT'S PROBABLY THE SON.
HE LIVES IN WESTCHESTER.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.761
HE OWNS AN ELECTRONIC
BUSINESS IN MIDTOWN.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.763
CLERK CALLED HIM
AT HIS SHOWROOM.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.723
GET OUT
OF MY WAY!

00:56.806 --> 00:58.725
IT'S OK. CAN WE
HELP YOU, SIR?

00:58.808 --> 01:00.727
I'M SIMON LEE. THIS IS
MY FATHER'S STORE!

01:00.810 --> 01:02.729
I'M DETECTIVE SIMONE.
THIS IS DETECTIVE
KIRKENDALL.

01:02.812 --> 01:03.897
WHY DON'T WE TAKE
A SECOND TO TALK HERE?

01:03.980 --> 01:05.523
I WANT TO SEE
MY FATHER.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.777
WHO, WHOA, WHOA.
TRY TO TAKE A BREATH,
MR. LEE, OK?

01:08.860 --> 01:09.903
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:09.986 --> 01:11.446
THERE WAS A SHOOTING
HERE THIS MORNING.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.073
YOUR FATHER
WAS SHOT, SIR.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.617
I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO
TELL YOU THIS.
HE'S DEAD.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.413
NOW CAN I ENTER?

01:20.497 --> 01:21.915
YEAH.
LET'S TALK OVER HERE.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.458
WHOA, WHOA, MR. LEE.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.668
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
I WANT TO SEE MY FATHER!

01:25.752 --> 01:27.754
YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE HIM
LIKE THAT.

01:27.837 --> 01:31.091
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO DID THIS.
WHEN, HOW, EVERYTHING.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.094
IT LOOKS LIKE A ROBBERY
WENT BAD. THERE WAS A COUPLE
OF GUYS RUNNING AWAY.

01:34.177 --> 01:37.097
THEY STEAL HIS
MOVADO WATCH? I TOLD HIM
NOT TO WEAR IT HERE.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.767
HE INSISTED.
SO PROUD I GAVE HIM
A MOVADO WATCH.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.143
WE DON'T SEE
A WATCH ON HIM.

01:42.227 --> 01:46.439
THERE. SEE? I BEGGED HIM.
"MOVE TO WESTCHESTER."

01:46.523 --> 01:49.567
HE SAID, "POOR PEOPLE
NEED FRESH FOOD, TOO."

01:51.528 --> 01:53.279
SOLD MORE BEER
THAN ORANGES!

01:53.363 --> 01:55.490
THESE PEOPLE
KILLED MY FATHER.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.284
IT'S TOO SOON
TO KNOW EXACTLY
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.287
THESE PEOPLE, THEY WANT
THINGS, THEY DON'T WANT
TO WORK FOR 'EM.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.957
ANIMALS! YOU KILLED
MY FATHER!

02:04.040 --> 02:06.042
MR. LEE, I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE UPSET.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.461
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP
FOR YOU TO START
INSULTING PEOPLE.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.296
ONE WAY TO MAKE 'EM TALK.
YOU, BOY.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.634
I'LL GIVE YOU $5,000
CASH MONEY IF YOU FIND
MY FATHER'S KILLER.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.303
YOU DON'T KNOW? FIND OUT.
TELL YOUR FRIENDS! GO ON!

02:17.387 --> 02:19.180
YOU CAN'T
DO THAT, MR. LEE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.599
THIS IS AMERICA.
I CAN DO WHAT I WANT.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.936
$5,000 REWARD TO FIND
MY FATHER'S KILLER!

02:25.019 --> 02:27.021

DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.236

04:03.785 --> 04:06.955
HE DON'T EVEN WANT TO

MINUTES TO COLLECT YOURSELF.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.915

04:08.998 --> 04:11.501

04:22.720 --> 04:24.514
YEAH.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.436

04:30.520 --> 04:33.022
"NEVER MIND
THE PROVOLONE.
LOVE SYL--"

04:33.106 --> 04:34.524
ALL RIGHT.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.566
HI, JILL.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.235

04:37.318 --> 04:38.319

04:38.403 --> 04:42.198
SO, UH...HOW'D IT GO
AT THE DOCTOR'S?

04:42.282 --> 04:47.036
GUY WANTS YOU
ACTIN' LIKE AN AUTO PART
ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.415
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SHOW NO SKITTISHNESS

04:50.498 --> 04:53.626
GETTING YOUR EYEBALLS
BURNED WITH SOME
INVISIBLE RAY.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.169
SO YOU BACKED OUT.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.882
YOU TWO OUGHT TO
WORK TAG TEAM.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.428
I'LL PRINT LARGER
ON YOUR MESSAGE
SLIPS, DETECTIVE.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.846

HURT.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.057
WRESTLING PRACTICE

05:09.392 --> 05:10.601
HEY, LIEU.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.645
UM, WHAT DID YOU GET
ON THAT GROCERY HOMICIDE?

05:12.729 --> 05:14.647
DOA'S THE STORE OWNER--
KOREAN.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.107
PLACE GOT ROBBED.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.942
PAST THE OPENING MONEY,
THE DOA'S SON SAYS

05:18.026 --> 05:19.777
THE DOA HAD THIS
REALLY EXPENSIVE WATCH
HE ALWAYS WORE.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.070
THAT'S IN THE WIND.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.447
WE GOT A STATEMENT
2 BLACK KIDS LEFT THE SCENE.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.489
NO GOOD DESCRIPTION.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.033
THE CLERK THAT WORKED
WITH THE DOA

05:25.116 --> 05:27.035
IS GONNA BE COMIN'
AND GIVE US
SOME MORE BACKGROUND.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.494
SON GIVE YOU ANYTHING?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.496
HE'S KIND OF A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.498
THIS GUY, HE ACTS LIKE
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD'S
CRIMINALS.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.167
THE ONLY WAY
THE CASE'LL MAKE

05:34.250 --> 05:36.377
IS HIM WALKIN'
UP AND DOWN THE STREET
OFFERIN' REWARD MONEY.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.338
DID YOU EXPLAIN TO HIM
IF HE DOESN'T LET US
FIELD THE INFORMATION,

05:38.421 --> 05:40.173
HE'S GONNA GET
RIPPED OFF OR WORSE?

05:40.256 --> 05:42.508
GUY'S REAL HARD
TO TALK TO.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.344
ANY CHANCE HE'S TRYING
TO DRAW SUSPICION
AWAY FROM HIMSELF?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.596
IT'S MORE LIKE
HE'S WORKING OFF
SOME KIND OF GUILT.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.264
YOU'D BETTER
HAVE HIM COME IN.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.474
YEAH. OK.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.100
I'LL GIVE HIM
A CALL.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.445
VICTIM--ANNIE WATTERS.
SHE'S 9.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.654
YEAH, WE GOT THAT.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.156
SAYS SHE WAS WALKING
NEAR FIRST AND TENTH

06:05.239 --> 06:06.949
WHEN SOME GUY
DRAGGED HER INTO
AN ABANDONED BUILDING,

06:07.033 --> 06:08.117
BEAT HER UP,
AND RAPED HER.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.161
SHE GOT TO A DELI
AFTER HE LET HER GO.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.204
THEY CALLED US.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.497
YOU CHECKED
THE BUILDING?

06:12.580 --> 06:13.831
NO ONE AROUND.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.208
LOCATE THE PARENTS?

06:15.291 --> 06:16.959
MOTHER WORKS UPTOWN.
SHE'S ON HER WAY IN.

06:17.293 --> 06:18.961
THANKS.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.380
HOW'S SHE DOIN'?

06:20.463 --> 06:21.923
CUTS AND BRUISES,
POSSIBLE CONCUSSION.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.633
SHE TOLD THE COP
SHE WAS RAPED.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.260
KIT'S NOT BACK,
BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY
HOW IT LOOKS.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.970
SON OF A BITCH.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.055
SHE'S PRETTY TRAUMATIZED.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.896
ANNIE? I'M DIANE RUSSELL.
I'M A DETECTIVE.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.440
THIS IS ANDY,
MY PARTNER.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.652
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY,
ANNIE?

06:42.735 --> 06:44.529
I DON'T WANT
TO TELL AGAIN.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.158
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK
WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.202
WERE YOU WALKING
TO SCHOOL?

06:54.330 --> 06:56.249
'CAUSE I MISSED THE BUS.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.669
THEN I GOT GRABBED.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.671
ANNIE!

07:03.005 --> 07:03.923
I'M SORRY!

07:04.006 --> 07:05.007
OH! OH!

07:05.091 --> 07:08.845
OH! YOUR FACE! MY GOD!
WHO DID THIS?

07:08.928 --> 07:10.972
WE'D JUST STARTED
TALKING TO ANNIE
ABOUT THAT, MS. WATTERS.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.974
MS. NELSON. I WENT BACK
TO MY MAIDEN NAME.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.892
OK, MS. NELSON.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.937
MAYBE YOU COULD SIT WITH
ANNIE WHILE WE TRY TO TALK
TO HER ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.939
IT WAS BILLY PODESKY,
RIGHT?

07:20.022 --> 07:21.482
OH, THIS WAS JUST
A QUESTION OF TIME.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.192
HE NEEDS TO BE
OFF THE STREET.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.279
DID THE BOY
YOUR MOM'S TALKING ABOUT
DO THIS TO YOU, ANNIE?

07:26.362 --> 07:29.282
HE'S OUR SUPER'S SON.
HE'S RETARDED, AND HE'S
INTO HIS ADOLESCENCE,

07:29.365 --> 07:31.284
AND YOU COULD JUST
SEE THIS COMIN' ON.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.411
MS. NELSON,
LET YOUR DAUGHTER TALK.

07:33.494 --> 07:38.207
DID YOU KNOW THE BOY
WHO ATTACKED YOU
THIS MORNING, ANNIE?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.250
[CRYING SOFTLY]

07:39.333 --> 07:42.295
ANNIE, TELL THEM
ABOUT BILLY.
DID HE DO THIS?

07:43.838 --> 07:47.216
MAYBE. HE HAD HIS HANDS
OVER MY EYES.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.634
MY GOD!

07:48.718 --> 07:50.636
YOU THINK MAYBE
IT COULD'VE
BEEN BILLY, ANNIE,

07:50.720 --> 07:51.762
OR YOU'RE PRETTY SURE
IT WAS?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.014
DON'T YOU BROWBEAT HER!

07:53.097 --> 07:54.432
IT'S YOU DOIN' THAT.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.267
IT WAS BILLY PODESKY!

07:57.435 --> 07:59.729
WE'LL GO TALK TO THE BOY
AND HIS FATHER.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.898
GET SOME REST, ANNIE.
WE'LL TALK
SOME MORE LATER?

08:01.981 --> 08:04.650
WE'RE REALLY SORRY
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

08:08.863 --> 08:12.325
YOU TELL HIS FATHER
I PLAN CIVIL
<i>AND CRIMINAL ACTION!</i>

08:12.408 --> 08:14.327
I TOLD HIM
ABOUT THIS!

08:16.871 --> 08:20.374
I HAVE TO LISTEN
TO THAT WOMAN
ANOTHER 10 MINUTES,

08:20.458 --> 08:22.460
<i>I'D WIND UP</i>
IN JAIL.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.552
APPRECIATE YOU
COMIN' IN.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.970
WELL...

08:33.054 --> 08:35.556
MR. LEE
WAS A GOOD MAN.
NO RACE PREJUDICE.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.683
THAT RIGHT?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.186
AS MANY OF THEM
AS HE HAD TO DEAL WITH.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.979
Kirkendall:
YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

08:42.063 --> 08:44.315
NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.484
SO WHO DO YOU THINK
IT WAS THAT MIGHT
HAVE KILLED MR. LEE?

08:46.567 --> 08:48.069
COULD'VE BEEN
ANY OF 'EM.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.987
"THEM" BEING WHO?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.489
THE BLACKS.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.991
HALF OF 'EM ARE
DRUNKS, CRACKHEADS,

08:54.075 --> 08:56.077
AND THE YOUNG ONES
ARE ALL HOODLUMS.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.621
ANY KIDS
SPECIFICALLY YOU THINK
MIGHT'VE DONE THIS?

08:58.704 --> 09:00.540
KIDS WHO RUN
IN PAIRS?
ANY OF 'EM.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.084
SHE'S ASKING IF ANY
OF "THEM" IN PARTICULAR

09:03.167 --> 09:05.419
HAD RUN-INS WITH MR. LEE,
MAYBE HAD IT IN FOR HIM.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.588
ALL OF 'EM.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.552
WHY WEREN'T YOU AT WORK
TODAY, GEORGE?

09:12.635 --> 09:14.554
I WAS AT HOME
WITH MY KIDS.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.848
MY WIFE'S MOTHER'S
IN THE HOSPITAL
HAVIN' HEART SURGERY.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.852
HOW DID MR. LEE
GET ALONG WITH HIS SON?

09:21.936 --> 09:23.813
3 YEARS I WORKED
FOR MR. LEE,

09:23.896 --> 09:26.190
I SAW THE GUY MAYBE
HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.192
HE THOUGHT
HE WAS BETTER THAN
HIS FATHER, SMARTER.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.736
LIKE, MR. LEE
PLAYED THE NUMBERS.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.240
ONE TIME HE HITS,
AND, UH, THE RUNNER'S
LATE PAYIN',

09:34.323 --> 09:36.534
AND HIS SON
SAYS MR. LEE'S STUPID,

09:36.617 --> 09:38.202
EXPECTING THEM PEOPLE
TO PAY OFF.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.623
BUT HE DID GET PAID,
3 DAYS LATER.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.042
ALL RIGHT, GEORGE.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.087
WE HAVE YOUR INFORMATION
IF WE NEED YOU AGAIN.

09:48.170 --> 09:51.549
I'M SORRY MY WIFE'S
MOTHER GOT SICK.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.552
COP CALLED,
AND I LEFT MY KIDS
TO COME COOPERATE.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.138
MR. LEE
WAS A GOOD GUY.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.723
NO RACE PREJUDICE
TOWARDS ME.

LOOK. LOOK. HOW
MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO SHOW THIS TO YOU?

10:44.435 --> 10:46.354
SHOWIN' ME AIN'T PUTTIN'
NOTHIN' IN MY POCKET.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.147
COME ON WITH ME,
FELICIA. WE'LL
WORK ALL THIS OUT.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.024
Simone:
I'LL BE IN THERE
IN JUST A SECOND.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.862
SHE KNOWS THE 2 BOYS WHO
KILLED MY FATHER, AND SHE
KNOWS WHERE TO FIND THEM.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.031
WE'RE GONNA BE
RIGHT IN HERE.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.534
LIEUTENANT.
THIS IS SIMON LEE.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.203
HOW DO YOU DO,
MR. LEE?

11:02.286 --> 11:04.163
I'M SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.916
I FIND A WOMAN THAT KNOWS
MY FATHER'S KILLERS WHILE
YOU PEOPLE SIT ON YOUR ASS.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.335
IS THAT THE WOMAN
I SAW YOU WITH
IN THE CATCHING AREA?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.337
I'M GONNA TALK TO HER
RIGHT NOW, BOSS.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.838
ALL RIGHT.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.632
DON'T WASTE MY TIME.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.342
I GATHER THIS WOMAN
CAME FORWARD

11:16.425 --> 11:18.969
BECAUSE OF THE REWARD
MONEY YOU'RE OFFERING
IN YOUR FATHER'S CASE.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.805
MONEY'S ALL
THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.808
AS YOU SAY,
THE PROSPECT OF A PAYDAY

11:23.891 --> 11:26.852
GENERATES ATTENTION
FROM ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.814
I HOPE THIS WOMAN'S
INFORMATION IS PRODUCTIVE,

11:29.897 --> 11:32.358
BUT IF WE HAVE TO CONTINUE
OUR INVESTIGATION,

11:32.441 --> 11:34.819
YOUR LETTING OUR OFFICE
HANDLE THE REWARD PROCESS

11:34.902 --> 11:38.322
WOULD HELP SIFT OUT
THE HUSTLERS, THE CRANKS,
AND THE CON ARTISTS.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.367
<i>I'LL SIFT OUT</i>
THE USELESS INFORMATION
AND BRING YOU THE REST.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.493
MR. LEE.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.829
WERE YOU LISTENING
TO WHAT I JUST SAID?

11:44.912 --> 11:46.831
LET US HANDLE
THE INVESTIGATION,

11:46.914 --> 11:50.292
AND GIVE YOURSELF SOME
TIME TO ABSORB THE SHOCK
OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.585
MY SHOCK IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.796
THIS WOMAN KNOWS
MY FATHER'S KILLERS,

11:53.879 --> 11:56.382
AND I STAY
WITH THE MONEY UNTIL
THOSE BOYS ARE ARRESTED.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.092
NO, YOU DON'T, MR. LEE.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.679
NOW, YOU STOP SHOUTING,
YOU TURN AROUND,
YOU LEAVE THIS BUILDING,

12:01.762 --> 12:05.099
AND IF WE FEEL
YOU'RE NEEDED BACK HERE,
WE'LL GET IN TOUCH.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.477
I'M SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.312
SHE KNOWS WHO KILLED
MY FATHER.

12:10.396 --> 12:14.150
IF SHE KNOWS, MY DETECTIVES
WILL FIND THAT OUT.

12:20.281 --> 12:24.285
I GOT A CHILD COMIN',
AND I GOT TO
LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.955
NOW, I MADE MISTAKES.
DON'T THINK I'M THE ONLIEST
ONE WHO'S DONE THAT.

12:28.038 --> 12:31.041
BUT THIS IS WHERE I AM,
AND I GOT RESPONSIBILITIES
TO MYSELF,

12:31.125 --> 12:33.043
MY FUTURE,
AND MY BABY.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.421
WELL, YOU SEE
HOW I'M BEAT UP.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.382
I'M 7-MONTHS PREGNANT,
AND I'M BEAT UP LIKE THIS.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.426
I GOT A RIGHT
TO SOME COMPENSATION,

12:40.509 --> 12:42.720
AND I GOT A RIGHT
TO A FUTURE.

12:49.059 --> 12:52.897
THE BOYS YOU LOOKIN' FOR
ARE NAMED GERARD AND ANTWAN.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.399
THEY DONE THAT ROBBERY,
DONE FOR THAT CHINAMAN,

12:55.483 --> 12:59.528
AND THEY BEAT ME UP, TOO.
GIMME THAT PEN.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.452
HERE'S WHERE YOU
CAN PICK 'EM UP.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.912
WHOSE PLACE IS THIS?

13:07.995 --> 13:10.581
HER NAME'S ANGELA.
AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
A .25 PISTOL,

13:10.664 --> 13:13.417
SO YOU BETTER
BE CAREFUL.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.668
WHAT'S ANGELA
TO YOU?

13:16.837 --> 13:18.339
SHE'S MY MOTHER.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.176
AND THEY MY SONS.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.670
Sipowicz: EXCUSE ME.

13:57.753 --> 13:59.421
YOU THE SUPER?

13:59.505 --> 14:00.798
SAM PODESKY.

14:00.881 --> 14:01.799
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.
THIS IS DETECTIVE
RUSSELL.

14:01.882 --> 14:02.925
THIS YOUR SON?

14:03.008 --> 14:04.176
BILLY. YEAH.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.803
Russell: HOW'S
IT GOIN', BILLY?
HOW'S IT GOING?

14:05.886 --> 14:07.513
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

14:07.596 --> 14:09.723
ONE OF YOUR TENANTS
WAS BEATEN ON HER WAY
TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.267
ANNIE WATTERS?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.143
NO. IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

14:13.227 --> 14:14.854
WHERE YOU BEEN
THIS MORNING?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.314
WORKIN' IN THE BUILDING.
IS THE LITTLE GIRL
ALL RIGHT?

14:17.398 --> 14:18.983
SHE SHOULD BE
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.694
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR BOY THERE?
WHERE'S HE BEEN?

14:21.777 --> 14:23.737
DOIN' MY CHORES
WITH ME.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.698
PEOPLE SEE YOU TOGETHER,
TENANTS WE COULD ASK?

14:25.781 --> 14:29.660
I COULDN'T SAY.
BUT IT WASN'T LIKE
WE WERE HIDIN'.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.620
I'D LIKE TO ASK BILLY
A FEW QUESTIONS NOW.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.706
HE'S SLOW.
YOU UNDERSTAND.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.958
BILLY, WHAT DID YOU
DO THIS MORNING?

14:36.041 --> 14:37.293
WE HAD BREAKFAST.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.794
WE HAD OUR CEREAL,
RIGHT?

14:38.878 --> 14:42.756
AND WE D-DID OUR TRASH
AND DADDY FIXED
THE BUZZERS.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.551
DID YOU SEE
ANNIE WATTERS
TODAY, BILLY?

14:45.634 --> 14:46.760
NO.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.178
ANNIE SAYS YOU
BEAT HER UP.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.222
WHAT? HE DID
NO SUCH THING.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.724
BILLY,
WHY DO YOU THINK
ANNIE WOULD SAY

14:51.807 --> 14:53.225
YOU BEAT HER UP
IF IT WASN'T
TRUE?

14:53.309 --> 14:54.977
HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO ANSWER A QUESTION
LIKE THAT.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.270
TAKE IT EASY.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.188
BILLY'S A GOOD BOY.
HE WOULDN'T
HURT ANYONE.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.691
THIS GIRL'S MOTHER
MIGHT'VE PUT HER
UP TO THIS.

15:00.774 --> 15:01.692
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE'D DO THAT?

15:01.775 --> 15:03.360
OFF MY OCCASION

15:03.444 --> 15:05.571
SAYING SHE HAD ME
KEEPING AN EYE ON HER
LITTLE ONE TOO OFTEN.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.239
HAVING YOU KEEP
AN EYE ON ANNIE?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.241
I DON'T MIND,
BUT IF WE'RE DOIN' CHORES,

15:09.325 --> 15:11.243
SOMETIMES SHE CAN GET
IN HARM'S WAY.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.287
SO, SINCE I SAID THAT,

15:13.370 --> 15:15.331
HER MOTHER'S AGITATED
AGAINST ME AND BILLY.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.207
REMARKS
TO THE TENANTS...

15:17.291 --> 15:18.584
THE OWNER.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.793
UM...TIME TO PUT
IN THE TRASH, RIGHT?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.211
JUST A SECOND, SON.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.922
ALL RIGHT,
MR. PODESKY.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.882
IF THE NEIGHBORS CONFIRM
YOUR STORY, WE WON'T
TROUBLE YOU ANY FURTHER.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.467
ANNIE WOULDN'T SAY
NOTHIN' AGAINST BILLY

15:26.550 --> 15:29.553
UNLESS HER MOTHER
MADE HER.
THIS A GOOD BOY.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.474
YOU ASK THE TENANTS.

15:33.557 --> 15:34.516
YEAH.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.101
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.657
A JUNKIE WILL
TELL YOU ANYTHING.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.825
AND SHE DID
TAKE A BEATING,

15:51.909 --> 15:53.494
SO I GUESS THAT COULD
PISS HER OFF ENOUGH

15:53.577 --> 15:54.787
TO JAM HER SONS UP.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.829
BUT YOU DO
BELIEVE HER?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.247
I BOUGHT IT.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.083
SAYS SHE'S BEEN
HOLDING THE GUN
FOR HER BOYFRIEND.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.834
SHE'S OUT THE LAST
COUPLE OF NIGHTS.

16:00.918 --> 16:01.794
7 MONTHS PREGNANT.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.587
7 MONTHS PREGNANT
AND USING.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.631
SHE COMES HOME
THIS MORNING,
THE GUN'S GONE.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.549
A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER,
THE BOYS SHOW UP.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.426
SHE ASKS THEM
ABOUT THE GUN,

16:09.510 --> 16:11.053
THE OLDER ONE
PUNCHES HER OUT.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.429
HOW'S SHE KNOW THEY'RE
AT HER MOTHER'S?

16:12.513 --> 16:14.390
SAYS THE YOUNGER ONE
WAS SCARED.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.059
THAT'S WHERE THEY HIDE OUT
WHEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.061
ALL RIGHT. GET SOME HELP
AND PICK THEM UP.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.105
YEAH.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.191
SO, UH, WHAT'D YOU SAY
TO THE DOA'S SON?

16:24.274 --> 16:25.609
GO HOME AND SHUT UP.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.279
GREG, JAMES,

16:29.363 --> 16:30.990
YOU GUYS OK
TO GIVE US A HAND?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.408
YEAH, SURE.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.620
WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DRINK, ANNIE?

16:36.704 --> 16:37.830
DO YOU HAVE
APPLE JUICE?

16:37.913 --> 16:38.998
YOU BET.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.457
YOU GOT
CRANBERRY JUICE?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.167
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.504
CRANBERRY JUICE.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.382
HOW'D IT GO WITH
THE SUPER'S SON?

16:48.465 --> 16:49.842
HE DIDN'T
RAPE NOBODY.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.261
WE'RE GONNA
REINTERVIEW.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.721
WHAT'S YOUR GROCERY
HOMICIDE LOOK LIKE?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.472
I GOT A COUPLE OF KIDS
TO LOOK AT.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.808
MOTHER'S A JUNKIE.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.435
SHE'S JUST GONNA
GIVE HER KIDS UP
FOR THE REWARD.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.645
AND THEY SAY NO GOOD
COMES OF DOPE.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.275
I'LL TALK TO YOU
IN A WHILE, BOSS.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.401
YEAH.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.864
WHATEVER. THEN I'LL HAVE
APPLE JUICE, TOO.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.201
SO WE WANTED
TO TELL YOU AND ANNIE

17:16.285 --> 17:18.162
HOW THINGS ARE GOING
ON OUR INVESTIGATION.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.663
WE TALKED TO
BILLY PODESKY
AND HIS DAD.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.708
THEY BOTH SAY HE WAS
WITH HIS FATHER
ALL MORNING.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.001
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA SAY?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.461
LISTEN
TO DETECTIVE RUSSELL.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.004
ALL RIGHT, MISS NELSON?

17:27.087 --> 17:28.839
WE ALSO TALKED
TO YOUR NEIGHBORS.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.300
THERE ISN'T MORE
THAN A 10 OR
15-MINUTE INTERVAL

17:31.383 --> 17:32.843
BETWEEN ONE
OR ANOTHER OF THEM

17:32.926 --> 17:34.219
SEEING BILLY.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.138
WELL, BETWEEN ME
AND THE SUPER
OF THEIR BUILDING,

17:36.221 --> 17:37.806
WHOSE SIDE DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.266
BE STILL NOW.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.396
GLORIA, WE'RE
PRETTY WELL CONVINCED

17:44.480 --> 17:45.898
BILLY WASN'T INVOLVED.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.281
THAT HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME, ANNIE.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.783
PEOPLE GET CONFUSED,

17:55.866 --> 17:58.869
OR THEY JUST
MAKE A MISTAKE.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.580
GROWN-UPS
MAKE MISTAKES, TOO.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.123
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING

18:03.207 --> 18:04.541
THAT YOU SHOULD FEEL
EMBARRASSED ABOUT

18:04.625 --> 18:07.044
OR FEEL LIKE
YOU CAN'T SAY.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.547
SO THE FIRST THING
I'D LIKE TO ASK IS

18:10.631 --> 18:12.007
IF YOU THINK--

18:12.091 --> 18:14.051
WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON
AT THE HOSPITAL--

18:14.134 --> 18:15.761
MAYBE WHAT YOU SAID
BACK THEN

18:15.844 --> 18:17.471
COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG?

18:22.184 --> 18:24.019
HMM?

18:30.859 --> 18:32.986
IT WASN'T BILLY.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.863
OK, SWEETHEART.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.743
DO YOU WANT SOME
OF MY APPLE JUICE?

18:39.827 --> 18:42.412
COULD I HAVE SOME?

18:55.008 --> 18:56.218
THANK YOU.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.018
ANNIE...

19:05.102 --> 19:06.895
CAN YOU TELL US
ANYTHING AT ALL

19:06.979 --> 19:09.648
THAT MIGHT HELP US
CATCH THE PERSON
WHO DID THIS?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.031
A MAN...

19:18.115 --> 19:20.492
SAID HE LOST HIS KITTY

19:20.576 --> 19:23.704
AND IF I COULD
HELP HIM LOOK.

19:23.787 --> 19:27.833
HE SAID IT RAN INTO
A BOARDED-UP BUILDING.

19:27.916 --> 19:31.545
SO I WENT THERE
WITH HIM TO LOOK.

19:31.628 --> 19:34.214
SO THEN HE DID
ALL HIS BAD THINGS.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.510
HE WASN'T TOO TALL,

19:38.594 --> 19:40.888
AND HE WAS LOSING
SOME OF HIS HAIR.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.643
AND I SCRATCHED HIM HERE...

19:46.727 --> 19:48.687
ON HIS CHEEK.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.440
OK, ANNIE. THAT'S
GONNA HELP US.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.399
GOOD FOR YOU.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.651
THAT'S WHEN
HE HIT ME A LOT.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.570
OK, SWEETHEART.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.488
[CRYING]

20:03.744 --> 20:06.580
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE,

20:06.663 --> 20:09.416
A SINGLE MOTHER
IN THIS KIND OF CITY.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.129
ALL RIGHT, BABY.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.970
YOU ALL SET UP
ON THE FIRE-ESCAPE?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.139
Officer on walkie-talkie:
ALL SET UP OUTSIDE.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.699
Woman: WHO IS IT?

20:42.783 --> 20:43.575
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.535
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE
OF A MISSING CHILD.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.537
I DON'T KNOW
NOTHIN' ABOUT IT.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.749
WELL, COULD I JUST
SHOW YOU THE PICTURE?

20:50.832 --> 20:52.960
[LOCKS OPENING]

20:55.003 --> 20:56.088
WHERE'S YOUR GRANDCHILDREN,
MISS CHIVERS?

20:56.171 --> 20:58.465
LEAVE 'EM ALONE!
I'M SICK.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.676
DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE,
OR YOU WILL GET HURT.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.552
HEY! WHAT--
WHAT WE DONE?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.805
JUST LIE STILL.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.682
BATHROOM'S CLEAR.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.850
I GOT A GUN.

21:08.934 --> 21:09.935
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

21:10.018 --> 21:11.186
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO FOR THEM NOW.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.145
AAH!

21:12.229 --> 21:13.897
JUST RELAX.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.927
NO, GIVE HIM A MINUTE.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.429
OK, OK. I WAS
AT THE PARK
THIS MORNING,

31:29.512 --> 31:31.890
AND THEN I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF TENTH AND FIRST.

31:31.973 --> 31:36.728
SO...IF SOMEONE SAW ME
AND THEN THIS INCIDENT--
AND MY RECORD--

31:36.811 --> 31:38.396
I CAN SEE YOU
PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER,

31:38.479 --> 31:39.397
BUT I KNOW
BETTER THAN ANYONE

31:39.480 --> 31:40.857
IF I RELAPSE
THE MESS I'LL BE IN.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.859
THAT'S HOW I KNOW
I DIDN'T!

31:42.942 --> 31:45.194
IF THERE'S CONFUSION,
GLENN,

31:45.278 --> 31:47.238
WILL YOU AGREE
TO STAND IN A LINEUP

31:47.322 --> 31:48.656
SO WE CAN CLEAR IT UP?

31:48.740 --> 31:51.117
YOU WANT ME ON A BUS?
I'LL GO. I'LL GET OUT
OF TOWN!

31:51.200 --> 31:52.452
GLENN...

31:52.535 --> 31:54.203
WILL YOU STAND
THE LINEUP?

31:57.498 --> 31:59.334
ALL RIGHT.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.544
ALL RIGHT.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.131
WHY WON'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?

32:21.314 --> 32:26.235
MAYBE SOME FUTURE POINT.
I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT
AT THIS JUNCTURE.

32:26.319 --> 32:31.950
NO, YOU ONLY <i>THINK</i>
YOU GOT A POLICY
AGAINST REFUNDS.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.953
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL COME DOWN THERE,

32:35.036 --> 32:36.746
AND YOUR PATIENTS
WILL NEED FLASHLIGHTS
READING THEIR EYE CHARTS,

32:36.829 --> 32:40.625
'CAUSE THEY'LL ALL BE
SHOVED UP YOUR ASS.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.585

32:42.669 --> 32:44.003
THANKS VERY MUCH.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.589
I BELIEVE
THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU

32:46.673 --> 32:48.591
IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM,
DETECTIVE.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.678
GOT A POLICY
AGAINST REFUNDS.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.977
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE 6 MEN
THROUGH THE MIRROR, ANNIE,

32:59.060 --> 33:00.937
BUT NONE OF THEM
CAN SEE YOU.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.188
IF YOU RECOGNIZE ANYONE,

33:02.271 --> 33:04.732
JUST TELL US WHAT NUMBER,
OK?

33:04.816 --> 33:05.942
OK.

33:14.867 --> 33:16.369
IT'S NUMBER ONE.

33:16.452 --> 33:17.870
HE SHOULD
BE EXECUTED.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.539
BE QUIET.

33:19.622 --> 33:23.042
WHERE HAVE YOU SEEN
NUMBER ONE BEFORE?

33:23.126 --> 33:26.295
HE SAID ON THE STREET
HE LOST HIS CAT.

33:27.755 --> 33:31.050
THEN HE TOOK ME
INTO THE BUILDING
AND HURT ME.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.177
HOLD NUMBER ONE.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.804
IS SHE GOING TO HAVE
TO TESTIFY?

33:34.887 --> 33:36.514
WE'RE GOING TO SEE
IF THAT'S NECESSARY.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.726
YOU DID REAL GOOD,
ANNIE.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.571
YOU GOING
TO CONFESS?

33:51.654 --> 33:52.780
WHAT?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.323
YOU'RE I.D.'d
FOR THE RAPE
AND BEATING.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.285
YOU WRITE
YOUR STATEMENT OUT,
WHAT YOU DID.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.620
YOU NEVER HEARD
OF A MISTAKEN I.D.?

34:00.663 --> 34:02.290
DON'T GIVE ME
THAT CRAP.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.374
I DIDN'T DO HER.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.333
[WHIMPERS]

34:04.417 --> 34:06.127
DON'T GET ME STARTED,
FARLEY.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.588
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
BUT I NEVER TOUCHED THAT GIRL.

34:10.631 --> 34:11.841
I'M REHABILITATED.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.971
SO YOU <i>WANT ME</i>
TO KILL YOU?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.347
BEATING ME
WON'T CHANGE MY STORY.

34:18.431 --> 34:21.100
SAYING YOU'RE REHABILITATED
WHEN I TOLD YOU NOT TO.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.436
YOU MUST WANT TO DIE
OFF THE BEATING.

34:23.519 --> 34:25.688
WHAT IS IT, YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO THROUGH
THE TRIAL?

34:25.772 --> 34:27.106
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.566
YOU WANT TO DIE HERE

34:28.649 --> 34:31.486
SO THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO THINK HOW
IT HAPPENED AGAIN?

34:31.569 --> 34:34.072
YOU'RE SICK GARBAGE.

34:34.155 --> 34:38.117
YOU CAN'T STOP YOURSELF
FROM HURTING A HELPLESS
LITTLE CHILD.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.535
YOU WANT TO DIE <i>NOW?</i>

34:39.619 --> 34:40.661
GO TO HELL.

TO BURN NEXT TO YOU?

BURN YOUR SICK MIND
AND GIVING PEOPLE BEATINGS!

34:50.004 --> 34:51.464
LIKE YOU BEAT THAT GIRL?

34:51.547 --> 34:55.426
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF!
YOUR SICK MIND
DOESN'T HAVE TO!

34:55.510 --> 34:56.636
THAT'S RIGHT!

34:56.719 --> 34:58.471
THAT'S RIGHT! YOU DO IT
'CAUSE YOU WANT TO!

34:58.554 --> 35:02.642
I RAPED HER FROM
A MONSTROUS FORCE!

35:02.725 --> 35:05.645
I'M A MONSTROUS FORCE!

35:10.399 --> 35:15.029

A HELPLESS FORCE.

35:18.199 --> 35:21.119
[SOBBING]

35:21.202 --> 35:23.830
YEAH, I WANT TO.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.507
MR. LEE.

35:34.590 --> 35:35.591
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

35:35.675 --> 35:36.634
YOU PICK UP THE BOYS?

35:36.717 --> 35:38.219
YEAH,
WE PICKED THEM UP.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.345
THEY'VE CONFESSED.

35:39.428 --> 35:41.097
WE'VE MOVED THEM
INTO THE COFFEE ROOM,

35:41.180 --> 35:43.558
AND NOW THEY'RE IN
THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING
THEIR STATEMENTS.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.017
YOU WANT ME
TO PAY THAT WOMAN?

35:45.101 --> 35:48.104
SHE CLAIMS
YOU SAID YOU'D PAY
ONCE AN ARREST WAS MADE.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.438
SHE'S NOT LYING.

35:49.522 --> 35:53.234
IF THAT'S THE CASE, YES,
WE HAVE MADE AN ARREST.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.652
HOW DID SHE KNOW
THOSE BOYS?

35:54.735 --> 35:56.529
THEY'RE HER SONS.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.530
ANIMALS.

35:57.613 --> 35:59.615
THE MOTHER, TOO.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.784
SHE SENT THEM OUT
TO MURDER?

36:01.868 --> 36:03.327
AT THE PROPER TIME,
YOU CAN READ
THE STATEMENTS.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.538
'CAUSE IF SHE SENT THEM
FOR THE MURDER,
I DON'T GIVE HER 10 CENTS.

36:05.621 --> 36:07.039
SHE DIDN'T SEND THEM
FOR THE MURDER.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.083
IS SHE GIVING YOU
PART OF THE REWARD?

36:11.752 --> 36:14.213
THEY SAID YOUR FATHER
WAS A NICE GUY.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.339
IS THAT WHY
THEY KILLED HIM?

36:15.423 --> 36:16.841
MAYBE THAT WAS
PART OF IT.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.885
PROBABLY MOST MERCHANTS
WOULD HAVE HAD A GUN
OF THEIR OWN.

36:18.968 --> 36:19.969
HE DIDN'T.

36:20.052 --> 36:21.721
HE JUST TRIED
TO TAKE THEIRS AWAY.

36:21.804 --> 36:24.098
SO MAYBE BEING A GOOD GUY
WAS PART OF WHY HE DIED.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.226
ON THE OTHER HAND,
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PRICKS
THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED, TOO,

36:27.310 --> 36:30.229
SO MAYBE BEING GOOD OR BAD
DOESN'T ENTER INTO
WHY WE DIE.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.107
WHAT YOU CAN COUNT ON,
MR. LEE, IS BEING NICE

36:33.191 --> 36:37.069
HELPED YOUR DAD
BE A LITTLE BIT HAPPY
WHILE HE WAS ALIVE.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.698

GO BURY HIM NOW?

HOW'S IT GOING?

37:05.056 --> 37:08.100

A GOOD TIME.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.647
OFF BEING CONTROLLED
BY A MONSTROUS FORCE.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.106
FORTUNATELY,
AS A SADIST,

37:14.190 --> 37:16.400
I COULD BRING THAT OUT.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.404
SORRY. YOU FORGOT
TO LOCK IT.

37:20.488 --> 37:21.739
NO, IT'S OK.

37:21.822 --> 37:22.740
YOU SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

37:22.823 --> 37:24.700
I INTENDED
TO FAIL TO URINATE.

37:26.118 --> 37:29.038
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO WASH YOUR HANDS
BEFORE YOU PISS?

37:29.121 --> 37:31.082
I WASH BEFORE
<i>AND AFTER,</i>

37:31.165 --> 37:33.626
BECAUSE CLEANLINESS
IS NEXT TO GODLINESS,

37:33.709 --> 37:35.127
PARTICULARLY IN SOMEONE

37:35.211 --> 37:37.421
WHO SECURES THE MAJORITY
OF HIS CONFESSIONS
BY BEATING.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.506
YOU WANT ME
TO SPLIT, ANDY?

37:38.589 --> 37:40.466
NO. NO.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.760

YOUR GUY UP, HUH?

37:42.843 --> 37:46.305

TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD

37:46.389 --> 37:47.765
AND ONE GOOD OPEN SLAP
TO HIS CHEEK

37:47.848 --> 37:50.393

BOTH OF US WERE SICK.
