WEBVTT

00:07.717 --> 00:08.968
MAGGIE: You okay?

00:09.094 --> 00:10.261
I'm thinking.

00:10.387 --> 00:12.222
Thinking's not gonna
get you to the top.

00:12.347 --> 00:13.765
Mom, you're supposed
to be encouraging me.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.600
No, I'm supposed
to be coaching you.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.435
The slower you go,
the more tired you're gonna get.

00:19.312 --> 00:20.814
(GRUNTS)

00:25.944 --> 00:27.904
There's a hold
about a foot above you on the left.

00:28.029 --> 00:28.988
I know.

00:32.367 --> 00:33.660
Nice grab!

00:34.786 --> 00:36.204
Keep going.
You're almost there, babe.

00:36.329 --> 00:37.706
I can't.
My calf's cramping.

00:37.831 --> 00:38.873
You need to get
off your toes.

00:38.998 --> 00:40.625
- Get on the ball of your foot.
- I can't.

00:40.750 --> 00:44.129
Yes, you can.
You can get all the way to the top.

00:49.968 --> 00:51.845
It's okay. I got you.
You all right?

00:51.970 --> 00:52.804
Looks like you were wrong.

00:52.929 --> 00:55.724
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. But you did awesome.
That's the highest you've gotten.

00:55.849 --> 00:56.808
I'm proud of you.

00:56.933 --> 00:57.976
I don't feel so good.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.853
Okay.
Come on down.

01:01.438 --> 01:02.439
Mom?

01:02.564 --> 01:03.773
(SIGHS EXHAUSTEDLY)

01:03.898 --> 01:05.567
Mom, are you okay?

01:11.865 --> 01:13.366
Oh, my God.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.702
(SCREAMING)

01:16.494 --> 01:19.664
Whoa!
Did you see that? You all right?

01:19.789 --> 01:21.416
- My arm. I think I broke it.
- Don't move.

01:21.541 --> 01:22.792
Oh, Jane,
I'm so sorry.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.002
What happened?
Did the rope break?

01:24.127 --> 01:28.089
No. My hands,
I can't move them.

02:05.710 --> 02:09.005
She's been to an ortho,
two neuros and an immunologist.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.049
None of the treatments
have had any effect.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.717
- You think it's over?
- It's getting worse.

02:12.842 --> 02:15.094
Last neurologist found
intermittent numbness in both arms

02:15.220 --> 02:16.429
as well as
the hand paralysis.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.723
I meant the game. You think
he's gonna keep all four of us?

02:18.848 --> 02:21.810
He said he would. No sign
of upper motor neuron involvement.

02:21.935 --> 02:23.102
He lies.

02:23.228 --> 02:24.771
HOUSE: My ears
are burning.

02:26.356 --> 02:27.899
Tell him you're
done firing people.

02:28.024 --> 02:31.194
Well, if I lie,
that would be little reassurance.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.489
Dr. Kutner, who told you
that it would be a good idea

02:34.614 --> 02:38.159
to put up superficial representations
of a hypocritical season

02:38.284 --> 02:40.119
celebrating a mythical figure?

02:40.245 --> 02:41.204
It wasn't me.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.122
He lied.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.584
Homey knows better,
Hymie doesn't care,

02:46.709 --> 02:48.711
and Huntington's
would have done a better job.

02:48.837 --> 02:50.046
I don't have Huntington's.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.548
- That you know of.
- Why would you...

02:51.673 --> 02:54.717
Because I got sued
when I called you "honey buns".

02:54.843 --> 02:55.969
Am I fired if I put up...

02:56.094 --> 02:57.428
The point of the game
was to scare us.

02:57.554 --> 02:59.055
Telling us it's over isn't scary.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.599
Therefore, he has no reason
to say that unless it's true.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.229
Good.
Then, can we do a Secret Santa?

03:07.230 --> 03:10.650
I liked you better 15 seconds ago
when you were afraid for your job.

03:10.775 --> 03:11.651
So, who's sick?

03:11.776 --> 03:13.611
35-year-old single mom.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.363
It's an odd presentation of paralysis.

03:15.488 --> 03:16.948
- Is there any history of drug use?
- No.

03:17.073 --> 03:18.700
HOUSE: She says
there's no history.

03:18.825 --> 03:20.493
She's not a liar.

03:20.618 --> 03:22.704
Okay.
This is gonna be a tough case.

03:22.829 --> 03:25.707
I have almost no knowledge
of alien physiology.

03:25.832 --> 03:28.084
Everyone lies.
But there's an exception to every rule.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.253
Actually, there isn't.
That's kind of what makes it a rule.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.505
The patient's mother died
of breast cancer when she was seven.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.007
She never even
knew her mom was sick.

03:34.132 --> 03:37.427
She promised herself she would never
hide anything from her own daughter.

03:37.552 --> 03:40.597
Oh. I didn't know
she'd promised.

03:40.722 --> 03:42.599
And we're not her daughter.

03:42.724 --> 03:45.184
The patient inherited
the BRCA1 mutation from her mom.

03:45.310 --> 03:47.562
She had a prophylactic
double mastectomy 10 years ago.

03:47.687 --> 03:48.521
She lied about it.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.481
She told her co-workers.
She told her kid.

03:50.607 --> 03:52.025
She lied to the world.

03:52.150 --> 03:54.485
Reconstructive surgery
is designed to convince people that...

03:54.611 --> 03:56.237
She didn't get
reconstructive surgery.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.115
KUTNER: Okay.
We can rule out breast cancer.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.368
Actually, I was gonna rule it in.
Paralysis could be paraneoplastic.

04:02.493 --> 04:05.371
Even the best surgeon can't remove
every cell of breast tissue.

04:07.874 --> 04:12.670
MRI what's left of her chest.
Set the machine to scan for irony.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.964
I'm gonna go re-do
the patient history.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.640
Your mom tell you
about all the drugs she does?

04:23.765 --> 04:27.143
She smokes pot once in a while,
but not in a long time.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.311
What about you?

04:28.436 --> 04:29.646
How would that
make her sick?

04:29.771 --> 04:31.022
Are you a doctor?

04:31.147 --> 04:32.523
I'm 11.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.653
That's not an answer.
That's an evasion.

04:37.612 --> 04:39.697
Drinking?
You ever sneak a drink?

04:39.822 --> 04:42.784
I don't do any of that stuff.
It's bad for you.

04:42.909 --> 04:45.620
I understand
why you don't want your mom to know.

04:45.745 --> 04:48.247
- But I'm her doctor, so...
- No, I would tell my mom.

04:48.373 --> 04:50.416
- And I would tell you.
- Why?

04:50.792 --> 04:52.835
Because she would
never lie to me.

04:55.004 --> 04:57.131
What's her favorite way
to have sex?

04:58.341 --> 05:00.677
I don't get what sex has to do
with breast cancer.

05:00.802 --> 05:01.970
Are you a doctor?

05:02.845 --> 05:04.639
Did you go to med school
since the last time I asked?

05:04.764 --> 05:06.349
You just think we've
got to be lying to...

05:06.474 --> 05:08.059
- White lies?
- What are those?

05:08.184 --> 05:11.104
Those are lies we tell
to make other people feel better.

05:11.229 --> 05:12.313
I don't lie.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.357
- Rationalizations?
- What are those?

05:14.482 --> 05:16.609
Those are lies we tell
to make ourselves feel better.

05:16.734 --> 05:19.445
- No. We don't...
- Lies of omission?

05:21.739 --> 05:23.825
Saddle, bronc or doggie?

05:24.951 --> 05:26.452
That's sex talk.

05:28.538 --> 05:33.042
She used to like being on top,
but now she likes to be on her stomach.

05:34.961 --> 05:38.923
That way she doesn't have to see them
looking at her scars.

05:46.014 --> 05:47.932
It's child abuse.

05:48.057 --> 05:49.392
Honesty?

05:49.517 --> 05:52.812
There's a reason that everybody lies.
It works.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.272
It's what allows
society to function.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.274
It's what separates
man from beast.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.942
Oh, I thought that
was our thumbs.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.111
You want to know every place
your mom's thumb has been?

06:00.236 --> 06:03.573
I'm sorry. I missed rehearsal.
Am I taking the truth-is-good side?

06:03.698 --> 06:06.409
- Don't you usually take that part?
- Lies are a tool.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.244
They can be used
either for good...

06:08.745 --> 06:10.288
Wait. I've got a better one.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.622
Lies are like children.

06:11.748 --> 06:14.959
They're hard work but they're worth it
because the future depends on them.

06:16.002 --> 06:19.630
You are so full of
love or something.

06:21.799 --> 06:24.635
- When you care about someone...
- You lie to them.

06:24.761 --> 06:28.264
You pretend that their constant,
ponderous musings are interesting.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.516
You tell them they're not losing
their boyish good looks

06:30.641 --> 06:31.726
or becoming worn out and...

06:31.851 --> 06:35.188
I stand corrected. And may I say it's
been a real pleasure chatting with you.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.899
Axilla is clean.
Surgical margins look clear.

06:38.024 --> 06:42.028
No lymphadenopathy, no masses,
no nothing. It's not cancer.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.864
We need a new theory.

06:44.989 --> 06:45.948
You catch her lying?

06:46.074 --> 06:46.949
Not yet.

06:47.075 --> 06:48.743
Wouldn't no have been
a shorter answer?

06:48.868 --> 06:51.871
Wouldn't you not talking
have made this a shorter conversation?

06:51.996 --> 06:53.122
Kid says Mom's a slut.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.082
She called her mom a slut?

06:54.207 --> 06:55.625
No. I called her mom a slut.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.877
She jumps anything
with a pole and a pulse.

06:58.002 --> 07:00.880
Not that I'm judging, here. Given her
medical history, I'm actually impressed.

07:01.005 --> 07:03.091
Maggie already admitted
to having multiple sexual partners.

07:03.216 --> 07:05.051
Which is why we
already tested for, and ruled out,

07:05.176 --> 07:07.428
syphilis and any other STD
that could have caused her symptoms.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.264
STDs aren't the only risk
in risky sex.

07:10.389 --> 07:13.351
The problem in sleeping
with strangers is, they're strange.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.019
We'll follow up
with any recent partners.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.730
Send Foreman and Taub.
They're better liars.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.690
More likely to
get to the truth.

07:26.447 --> 07:29.158
You think I drugged her?
Use a coaster.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.912
We're not cops. Legally,
we don't care one way or another.

07:33.037 --> 07:34.747
But we need to know the truth
so we can help her.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.458
I'd known her for less than an hour
and she offered to take me home.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.001
There was no need
to drug her.

07:39.127 --> 07:40.711
(CHUCKLES)

07:40.962 --> 07:42.338
Not that I would.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.883
She's gonna be okay, right?

07:46.008 --> 07:49.220
As long as she doesn't
have to pick up or hold anything, yeah.

07:49.345 --> 07:52.557
Sorry. I just had
the floors done. Reclaimed pine.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.896
You always
this thirsty?

07:59.397 --> 08:00.606
I don't know.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.900
Water's supposed to
be good for you, right?

08:04.110 --> 08:05.945
Dehydration, anxiety, aggression.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.155
I'm not aggressive.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.657
Spastic chorea
in his right hand.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.450
- What about my hand?
- How much do you weigh?

08:11.576 --> 08:13.411
- About 180, 190?
- 180. What is this?

08:13.536 --> 08:15.913
If you took what she did,
it could take longer to hit you.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.832
It might affect you differently.

08:17.957 --> 08:20.209
But you didn't
give her anything, right?

08:21.836 --> 08:24.046
She was really drunk.

08:24.172 --> 08:27.925
I just gave her some E
to help enhance things.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.260
Have any of it left?

08:31.179 --> 08:32.638
Is my hand gonna be okay?

08:32.763 --> 08:34.640
There's nothing
wrong with it.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.350
We lied.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.858
I've had a sore throat
for a few days now.

08:43.983 --> 08:45.943
My stomach's also
been bothering me.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.778
I think my glands are swollen.

08:49.989 --> 08:51.282
Saint Nicholas?

08:52.408 --> 08:53.659
Patron saint of children.

08:53.784 --> 08:57.663
Also seamen, merchants,
archers, prostitutes and prisoners.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.416
Mmm. He must have been
pretty hard working.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.002
Or just a credit hog.

09:03.127 --> 09:04.462
Open wide.

09:05.004 --> 09:07.089
- Say, "Ah."
- Ah.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.300
You have strep.

09:09.425 --> 09:11.219
Is it contagious?

09:11.344 --> 09:14.764
Only for the next 24 hours,
as long as you take the antibiotics.

09:14.889 --> 09:16.182
How contagious?

09:16.766 --> 09:17.934
Take a personal day.

09:18.059 --> 09:19.602
I can't.

09:20.770 --> 09:22.355
I'll write your pimp a note.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.522
My pimp?

09:23.648 --> 09:25.775
You get tested for AIDS
every three months.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.485
And your necklace.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.820
Prostitutes wear religious symbols?

09:29.946 --> 09:32.156
I think they just
like kneeling.

09:33.658 --> 09:36.118
You don't have the skin of a seaman,
the fingers of an archer,

09:36.244 --> 09:38.913
the clothes of a merchant
or the attitude of an ex-con.

09:39.038 --> 09:40.456
So, that just
leaves one left.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.583
Mmm, two, actually.

09:44.669 --> 09:46.462
But I'm not a child, am I?

09:58.349 --> 10:00.101
You owe me 50 bucks.

10:00.226 --> 10:02.853
Then you owe me
half a lap dance.

10:02.979 --> 10:05.606
It's for the nurses' holiday bonus.
I know you got the memo.

10:05.731 --> 10:09.068
I got the memo last year.
I want to hire 40 more fellows.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.861
You already fired
the ones you hired?

10:10.987 --> 10:12.530
They work better
when they're scared.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.573
You were right.
Guy slipped her Ecstasy.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.368
- He have any symptoms?
- No.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.287
Kutner's starting the patient
on hemodialysis,

10:19.412 --> 10:20.830
and Thirteen's in the lab
trying to figure out

10:20.955 --> 10:23.040
what the guy put in the drugs.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.586
See? Clear, simple statement of facts

10:27.712 --> 10:31.215
describing their cooperation
with absolutely no attitude or fear.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.717
Something's got to be done.

10:32.842 --> 10:33.926
Oh, yeah.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.596
How are you feeling?

10:37.722 --> 10:39.390
I still can't move my hands.

10:39.515 --> 10:42.685
It will take a few more hours to cycle
all your blood through the machine.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.770
What just happened?

10:45.479 --> 10:46.897
Nothing. What's wrong?

10:47.023 --> 10:49.358
What do you mean?
The lights just went out.

10:49.734 --> 10:50.943
Didn't they?

10:51.360 --> 10:52.653
What did you do?

10:52.778 --> 10:53.738
Is this from the drugs?

10:53.863 --> 10:55.323
Most of the drugs
should be out of your system by now.

10:55.448 --> 10:56.574
- And our drugs wouldn't...
- I can't see.

10:56.699 --> 10:57.616
Do something!

10:57.742 --> 10:58.868
I can't see!

10:59.827 --> 11:01.495
I can't see!

11:06.917 --> 11:09.337
Nothing in the Ecstasy
except Ecstasy.

11:09.462 --> 11:10.713
Well, that never hurt anybody.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.923
Can't make them
blind days later.

11:13.049 --> 11:15.718
Do you spell "Homey"
with a "Y"?

11:15.843 --> 11:17.762
I want to be respectful.

11:17.887 --> 11:19.221
You're actually
gonna let us do Secret Santa?

11:19.347 --> 11:21.432
Not just you guys-

11:21.557 --> 11:23.267
I like presents, too.

11:25.478 --> 11:26.896
Pick a name.

11:27.021 --> 11:28.022
Why are you doing this?

11:28.147 --> 11:30.566
See, this is why
no one likes your people.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.485
The notion of picking
one time of the year

11:32.610 --> 11:34.362
to be decent to other people is obscene

11:34.487 --> 11:35.988
'cause it's actually
validating the notion

11:36.113 --> 11:37.740
of being miserable wretches
the rest of the year.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.034
So, you think this is
the part of the year that's screwed up?

11:40.785 --> 11:43.537
On the other hand, you are now a team.
You've got to work together.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.332
And the simple fact is, giving
people crap makes people like people.

11:46.457 --> 11:48.793
So, spend 25 bucks.
Learn to love.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.879
Blindness could be a complication
from the hemodialysis.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.799
No, the dialysate composition
was within range.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.551
- Sweet.
- Interesting.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.136
The dialysate composition
just indicates...

11:59.261 --> 12:02.098
Indicates nothing. I was referring
to his reaction to the name he got.

12:02.223 --> 12:04.058
I was pleased.
I thought it'd be fun to buy for...

12:04.183 --> 12:07.103
Means there's someone here
it wouldn't be fun to buy for.

12:07.228 --> 12:09.814
I wonder who.
Pick a name.

12:09.939 --> 12:14.652
Then go check out
the patient's house.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.154
Interesting.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.073
FOREMAN: We're wasting time
going to the home.

12:19.198 --> 12:21.033
Kearns-Sayre Syndrome
fits the symptoms.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.285
No family history of Kearns.
Go to their house.

12:23.411 --> 12:25.538
She would have told us if there were
any other drugs. You met her.

12:25.663 --> 12:27.623
- She couldn't have been more candid.
- You're absolutely right.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.376
- Go to their house...
- MS or a vascular problem fits better.

12:30.501 --> 12:31.961
They could affect
hands and eyes.

12:33.129 --> 12:35.381
Fine.
Do an MRI, check for MS.

12:35.506 --> 12:38.759
And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes
to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.

12:38.884 --> 12:42.805
Oh, and whoever goes to their house,
get me their computers.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.682
You talk to your
kid about sex

12:44.807 --> 12:47.017
so she'll think
you're being open about everything.

12:47.143 --> 12:49.687
It keeps her from asking questions about
things you don't want to talk about.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.690
That's right. Her honesty proves
just how dishonest she is.

12:52.815 --> 12:56.652
Yes! Exactly who I wanted.
This is gonna be fun.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.453
The dye may sting
when it enters your bloodstream.

13:05.578 --> 13:07.121
Are you scared, Mom?

13:07.246 --> 13:08.622
Yeah.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.541
- Are you?
- Yeah.

13:10.958 --> 13:11.876
Are they?

13:13.210 --> 13:15.421
They don't
look scared.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.882
Either they're confident
or they just don't care.

13:18.299 --> 13:19.425
We're confident.

13:19.550 --> 13:22.261
Okay if I shift you a bit?
I need to get you into position.

13:28.184 --> 13:30.269
(SCANNER WHIRRING)

13:30.394 --> 13:31.854
Your boss is weird.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.772
Yeah, he is.

13:34.190 --> 13:37.568
He thought he'd get information
you may not have been telling us by...

13:37.693 --> 13:38.903
Being a jerk?

13:39.028 --> 13:40.988
You'd be surprised
how often it works.

13:41.113 --> 13:42.448
Choroidal flush looks good.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.659
Why would people lie to a doctor?

13:45.784 --> 13:48.370
Dozens of reasons to lie.
Only one reason to tell the truth.

13:48.496 --> 13:51.248
You're never even tempted?

13:51.373 --> 13:56.337
I mean, lies do sometimes
smooth things out, make life easier.

13:56.462 --> 13:58.589
Yeah?
Your life easy?

13:59.673 --> 14:00.925
Not even close.

14:01.717 --> 14:05.054
Dye's reached the retinal capillary bed.
No leakage.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.307
That's good, right?

14:08.807 --> 14:10.893
It means it's not
a vascular problem.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.938
- But?
- A vascular problem we could fix.

14:18.526 --> 14:20.736
They look worried now, Mom.

14:24.365 --> 14:25.533
What's with
the Secret Santa?

14:25.658 --> 14:27.034
You trying to
bring them together?

14:27.159 --> 14:28.827
Want to
drive them apart.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.621
With gift giving?

14:30.746 --> 14:32.164
Conflict's built
right into the name.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.125
Santa's about sharing.
Secret's about withholding.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.879
Aside from the Trojan horse,
gifts don't usually...

14:39.004 --> 14:42.424
What did you get your wife
for your final anniversary?

14:42.550 --> 14:44.552
- Uh, a sweater.
- She hated it.

14:44.677 --> 14:45.636
She loved it.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.304
Then you didn't buy it.

14:47.429 --> 14:51.392
I gave her some cash and...

14:53.143 --> 14:56.397
Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly
how little we know about a person.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.023
And nothing pisses off
a person more

14:58.148 --> 15:00.150
than being shoved
in the wrong pigeonhole.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.236
(MUTTERING) Nice.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.948
I'm thinking of spending
a few extra bucks on my Secret Santa.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.157
Bad idea.

15:07.283 --> 15:09.743
You mind if I tell House you asked them
for the key instead of breaking in?

15:09.868 --> 15:12.288
- Yes. I do. Just another 5 bucks.
- 5 will be 10.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.039
The key's proof
she doesn't have anything to hide.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.542
The key is proof I didn't do exactly
what House told me to do.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.002
And what do you care
if it's another 15?

15:18.127 --> 15:20.421
I'm gonna tell him.
Who are you so anxious to please?

15:20.546 --> 15:22.089
(SNORTS) Not you.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.425
You really think you're gonna prove
people are capable of honesty

15:24.550 --> 15:26.677
using a mother and daughter
you've known for one day?

15:26.802 --> 15:29.305
I'm not the one who's based
his entire worldview on the proposition.

15:29.430 --> 15:32.391
If I'm wrong, so what?
If he's wrong...

15:35.853 --> 15:37.354
- So, you've got Huntington's?
- Nope.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.314
But House said that...

15:38.439 --> 15:40.524
If I wanted to talk about it,
why didn't I bring it up?

15:43.193 --> 15:45.904
TAUB: Fluorescein angiogram was clear.
No leaks. No lesions.

15:46.030 --> 15:48.824
(BEEPS)
Definitely not a vascular problem.

15:49.450 --> 15:52.077
Someone get their birthdays
out of the file.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.871
Have you tried
leaving it blank?

15:56.665 --> 15:59.960
Tough to get into the head of someone
who actually trusts people, huh?

16:00.919 --> 16:04.673
Found both computers in an office
on a desk they share.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.967
No sign of macular degeneration
or optic neuritis.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.385
Her eyes are
completely normal.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.137
Except she can't
see out of them.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.431
So she says.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.766
You find anything
on the MRI?

16:13.891 --> 16:15.726
No sign of plaques.
It's not MS.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.561
We haven't found anything abnormal
on any tests.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.480
Except she can't see
or move her hands.

16:19.605 --> 16:20.648
So she says.

16:20.773 --> 16:23.067
You can't lie about
flaccid paralysis.

16:24.443 --> 16:27.196
Maybe she's not lying.
Her brain is.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.490
What if it's
a conversion disorder?

16:29.615 --> 16:31.575
Lacks personal boundaries.

16:33.077 --> 16:37.122
Promiscuous. Inappropriate obsession
with truth telling.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.208
Certainly sounds like a psych case.

16:40.084 --> 16:43.295
Cool. I'll set up a psych consult
and start her on anti-depressants.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.713
No.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.676
Her mind is
tricking her body.

16:49.802 --> 16:51.470
We need to
trick her mind.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.640
Or even better...

16:58.018 --> 16:59.561
- You don't need her.
- I know.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.438
Then this serves
no medical purpose.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.400
You have a genetic defect,
choose to ignore it.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.193
This woman has
a genetic defect,

17:06.318 --> 17:08.487
chooses to butcher herself
to be safe.

17:08.612 --> 17:12.199
Yet, what you claim
to be fascinated by is her honesty.

17:12.324 --> 17:13.450
Interesting.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.452
You claim to
want the truth.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.706
And then you screw with people
who actually live by it. Pathetic.

17:18.831 --> 17:20.999
Hey, I gave you credit
for interesting.

17:22.626 --> 17:26.380
You're protecting her because you're
jealous she did what you couldn't.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.424
I need you.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.427
I'm not lying to her.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.721
Fine. Keep your mouth shut.
I still need you.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.140
If it doesn't work,
you've got to hold the kid down

17:36.265 --> 17:38.559
until someone else
finishes lying to Mom.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.811
That does actually serve
a medical purpose.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.360
Jane.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.697
I have to lie
because she trusts me?

17:51.822 --> 17:55.576
If you show doubt,
the placebo treatment won't work.

17:55.701 --> 17:58.495
If it's just depression,
that's good news, right?

17:58.620 --> 17:59.788
There are a lot of
great medications.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.417
Why can't we just give her those?
Why do we have to lie to her?

18:03.542 --> 18:05.711
Because we might be wrong.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.671
Those medications
take a long time to work,

18:07.796 --> 18:10.215
and since
your mom's condition's declining,

18:10.340 --> 18:13.260
there's a chance the drugs won't tell us
anything until it's too late.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.805
My mom's not depressed.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.474
Maybe she's
hiding it from you.

18:18.599 --> 18:19.933
No.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.394
- She wouldn't.
- She's doing what every good mom does.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.439
Protecting her child from bad news
that she can't do anything about.

18:25.564 --> 18:26.982
My mom's never lied to me.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.609
If you don't know
how to lie,

18:29.318 --> 18:31.779
you don't know how to tell
when you're being lied to.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.076
Maybe you're right.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.953
- I know I'm...
- I was lying.

18:40.913 --> 18:42.623
I know how to lie.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.293
I just won't do it
to my mother.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.759
You like foosball?

18:55.469 --> 18:58.514
Until the treatment of your
infectious paraparesis takes effect,

18:58.639 --> 19:00.182
Jane can't come back
into the room.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.433
I've already been inoculated.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.976
Can she have it already?

19:03.101 --> 19:05.395
Don't worry.
It's a very effective treatment.

19:05.521 --> 19:08.190
You should be feeling better
in a matter of minutes.

19:08.982 --> 19:09.858
(GROANS)

19:12.236 --> 19:14.404
Don't you think
Jane deserves a few secrets?

19:14.530 --> 19:16.323
Some personal space?

19:16.448 --> 19:19.451
Room to make
her own mistakes?

19:19.576 --> 19:21.995
She makes plenty of mistakes.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.248
Only difference is I'm there
to help her through them.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.667
But she's got to know
you're looking over her shoulder.

19:26.792 --> 19:27.876
It's got to stifle her.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.461
I think the world would
be a better place

19:29.586 --> 19:32.798
if everybody always acted like their mom
was looking over their shoulder.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.563
- I want to go see my mom.
- She's sleeping.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.147
Why don't we just
double the amount we can spend?

19:49.273 --> 19:51.108
- Nope.
- Can't afford another 25?

19:51.233 --> 19:53.277
If we allow people 50,
people will spend 60.

19:53.402 --> 19:54.945
Ah! So, you can't afford
another 35.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.531
- You must really like who you got.
- Or really dislike.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.785
My mom always gives
the best presents

20:01.910 --> 20:03.745
to the teachers
I get along with the worst.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.249
- No.
- No.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.713
How do you know no?

20:12.838 --> 20:14.673
I know you
didn't get House.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.926
I know he
didn't get House.

20:18.844 --> 20:21.388
- You gave them all your name?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:21.513 --> 20:25.684
I figured I could sow some dissension
and get a few ties and sweaters.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.352
What happens
when they find out?

20:27.477 --> 20:28.979
It's Secret Santa.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.316
What happens
when they find out?

20:32.441 --> 20:35.319
They'll argue about what to do
with that information.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.446
The ties are less important
than the dissension.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.615
- We still have to buy him something.
- Not a chance.

20:39.740 --> 20:41.867
We weren't supposed to discuss this.
We're not supposed to know.

20:41.992 --> 20:44.244
He's not supposed
to put his name in there five times.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.622
He wants presents.
It's sad.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.457
It's pathetic.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.918
I'm still buying him a present.

20:51.043 --> 20:52.628
(FIRMLY) No, you're not.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.297
Fine.

20:57.174 --> 20:59.217
(MOANING WEAKLY)

21:04.598 --> 21:06.350
(WHEEZING)
What's wrong?

21:06.475 --> 21:07.559
I think it's
getting worse.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.812
(ALARM BEEPING)
I can't breathe.

21:10.938 --> 21:12.940
(GASPING)
I need a nurse in here!

21:18.070 --> 21:20.489
Her lymph nodes are cutting off
her airway. We've got to intubate!

21:21.031 --> 21:25.702
(GASPING)

21:31.917 --> 21:34.252
The swollen lymph nodes
were cutting off Maggie's airway.

21:34.378 --> 21:37.005
We shrunk them with alcohol
and she's breathing on her own now.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.799
Well, that sucks.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.259
Four thousand, three hundred
saved emails

21:41.385 --> 21:45.263
and not a single mention
of "lesbionic," "Sanchez," or "mangina."

21:45.389 --> 21:47.683
Swollen lymph nodes
means it wasn't psychological.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.935
Who's that from?

21:50.060 --> 21:53.021
Santa, obviously.
As you know, I worship him.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.358
Oh, wait. I meant Satan.
I always get them confused.

21:57.150 --> 22:02.072
What is an "alpine butterfly"?
And why is she learning how to do one?

22:02.197 --> 22:04.408
House, we already have a full history.
You don't need to waste time...

22:04.533 --> 22:06.660
- It's just a climbing knot.
- But what does she use it for?

22:06.785 --> 22:08.370
Try "bondage."

22:08.495 --> 22:09.454
HOUSE: I did once.

22:09.579 --> 22:11.331
But she just tied me down and whined

22:11.456 --> 22:13.208
about how hard it is
to be Dean of Medicine.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.793
Gyms aren't exactly pristine.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.129
Could be a fungal infection.
Seriously, who's it from?

22:17.254 --> 22:18.505
No fever.
No elevated white count.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.798
(LAUGHS OBNOXIOUSLY)

22:19.923 --> 22:23.176
That's funny. Friend sent her
a Garfield cartoon.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.178
That cat sure does love lasagna.

22:25.303 --> 22:28.640
(SHARPLY) House, stop obsessing.

22:29.391 --> 22:34.104
If it weren't for my obsessions, we
wouldn't know that she has sarcoidosis.

22:35.147 --> 22:37.816
Eighteen months ago,
she sold her Stairmaster.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.109
It was only two months old.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.610
Now, either she needed the cash,

22:40.736 --> 22:43.113
or climbing stairs
was getting more difficult.

22:43.238 --> 22:46.283
Twelve months ago,
she canceled a hiking trip.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.618
Now, either she just
wanted to sit home and watch TV,

22:48.744 --> 22:50.454
or walking was
getting more difficult.

22:50.579 --> 22:53.874
She's been suffering joint pain
for the last two years.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.293
Pull my ribbon.
If you know what I mean.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.046
ACE levels are too low
for sarcoidosis.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.673
That's not
what I meant.

23:02.299 --> 23:03.675
Could just be
an inactive phase.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.676
It's not Christmas yet.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.012
I remembered.
I'm not a Satanist. I'm a Druid.

23:07.137 --> 23:08.305
- No lung involvement.
- Yet.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.599
We'll need a bronchoalveolar lavage
to confirm it.

23:10.724 --> 23:14.853
That's a shame. I was gonna surprise her
with one for Christmas.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.189
Wow!

23:18.273 --> 23:21.276
Now, either that cost
more than 25 bucks,

23:21.401 --> 23:24.529
or I'm seriously starting to doubt
Steve Jobs' business strategies.

23:26.239 --> 23:27.824
Thanks!

23:30.619 --> 23:33.747
Last round of saline, Maggie.
One more big breath.

23:33.872 --> 23:37.167
You've got to get the liquid
to go all the way into your lungs, okay?

23:37.292 --> 23:38.293
Here we go.

23:40.545 --> 23:41.922
The gift could be
from a patient.

23:42.964 --> 23:44.591
Who sent it to
the wrong doctor?

23:44.716 --> 23:46.426
House obviously
gave the present to himself.

23:53.016 --> 23:54.601
They're arguing
right now.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.394
I've been looking
for this all morning.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.063
Did you look
in the box on my desk?

23:58.188 --> 24:00.816
Oh, by the way, your mom called.
Your dad's dead.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.693
You left the present
sitting on your desk?

24:03.819 --> 24:06.571
It wouldn't have been as effective
sitting in a closet in my home.

24:06.696 --> 24:07.948
- They're gonna know it's from you.
- No.

24:08.073 --> 24:09.658
They're gonna guess
that it was from me.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.284
They might even be 90% sure
that it was from me.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.829
But all that means is
they're 10% percent sure

24:13.954 --> 24:16.123
that one of the other guys
is screwing them over.

24:17.082 --> 24:19.793
Have you ever considered
channeling your powers to,

24:19.918 --> 24:22.462
I don't know,
bring peace to the Mid-east?

24:22.587 --> 24:23.880
I couldn't do that.

24:24.005 --> 24:25.924
But if they ever got it,
you could screw it up.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.552
Yeah. That's more
where my powers lie.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.138
- The gift could be from Wilson.
- It's House.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.806
Why do you have a problem
with him speculating?

24:32.931 --> 24:35.475
Because that's what
House wants us to do.

24:36.268 --> 24:38.854
Lungs are pristine.
No infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.

24:38.979 --> 24:42.149
Maggie, I'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?

24:42.315 --> 24:43.275
(COUGHING)

24:43.400 --> 24:44.693
A little harder.

24:44.818 --> 24:45.986
(COUGHING)

24:46.111 --> 24:47.529
Great.

24:49.906 --> 24:52.534
Maggie?
Open your eyes.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.333
Why aren't you
saying anything?

25:03.170 --> 25:04.713
What's wrong?

25:05.964 --> 25:07.924
Maggie tested negative
for sarcoidosis.

25:08.049 --> 25:10.468
But she's bleeding
into her eyes, now.

25:10.594 --> 25:11.887
Have her
platelets dropped?

25:12.012 --> 25:13.722
Plummeted.
New labs show they're under 40.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.765
She'll bleed out of every orifice
if we don't find the cause.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.934
Could be splenic sequestration,
tuberculosis.

25:18.059 --> 25:19.477
Gaucher disease, TTP.

25:19.603 --> 25:21.605
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome,
sepsis, lupus...

25:21.730 --> 25:24.357
Listing all the possible causes
is only impressive

25:24.482 --> 25:26.318
if you can do it
reverse alphabetically.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.778
We need to know
why her platelet machine is broken.

25:28.904 --> 25:32.282
Go to the factory.
Do a bone marrow aspiration.

25:41.625 --> 25:43.210
I'm your Secret Santa.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.130
You're not supposed to tell.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.715
But you got
a present already,

25:48.840 --> 25:51.259
which means you have more
than one Secret Santa.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.596
Or somebody else
wants to make me happy.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.392
Merry Christmas.

26:16.952 --> 26:19.871
On the one hand,
you should be in bed.

26:19.996 --> 26:23.541
On the other hand, I told you to rest.
So, I see your dilemma.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.294
Hey, I don't think
resting is the problem.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.880
Can strep cause this?

26:29.798 --> 26:31.049
Clap on.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.218
Trust me,
first place I went.

26:33.969 --> 26:37.722
No rash on my labia.
Do you need to take a look?

26:38.265 --> 26:41.518
I'm saving my money
for a Red Rider BB gun.

26:43.979 --> 26:45.730
Darker shade of lipstick?

26:45.855 --> 26:47.607
I'm not wearing any.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.698
You tell your mother
what you do?

26:54.823 --> 26:56.574
It doesn't matter.
I'm curious.

26:57.325 --> 27:00.453
I don't need to break her heart
just so I can feel righteous.

27:07.377 --> 27:09.170
Do you do
a donkey show?

27:09.963 --> 27:12.841
I'm not curious.
It matters.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.721
It's a donkey
or a mule.

27:19.264 --> 27:21.558
I can never remember.

27:22.142 --> 27:25.103
Wow. That is a creepy smile.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.856
I bet the donkey's
is even creepier.

27:28.523 --> 27:30.525
- Do I have to explain...
- Nope.

27:30.859 --> 27:31.901
That's my job.

27:32.027 --> 27:33.445
Contagious ecthyma.

27:33.570 --> 27:37.907
Any contact can cause
rashes, flu symptoms, sore throat.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.409
Has there been

27:39.534 --> 27:40.660
contact?

27:43.163 --> 27:46.124
Okay. Antibiotic cream for you

27:46.249 --> 27:48.710
and a love glove for Francis.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.754
You'll both be fine.

27:54.215 --> 27:57.802
You should come and see the show.
I think you'd like it.

27:58.303 --> 28:00.638
Sorry. I hate Westerns.

28:14.027 --> 28:15.445
CHASE: So, they really never lie?

28:15.570 --> 28:16.738
Doesn't seem like it.

28:16.863 --> 28:17.864
Admirable.

28:17.989 --> 28:18.948
You tell Cameron everything?

28:19.074 --> 28:20.909
(SCOFFS) No.

28:21.284 --> 28:22.577
You think she
keeps secrets?

28:22.702 --> 28:26.456
If I knew, they wouldn't be secrets.
I hope she does.

28:26.581 --> 28:30.251
People have a right to a little privacy,
even from the people they love.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.341
Did you buy House a present?

28:37.008 --> 28:38.718
- Why would I?
- To screw with me.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.220
Then, I'm gonna say yes.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.223
No, wait. Stop. Stop.
What's that smell?

28:45.642 --> 28:47.435
The bone is smoking.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.398
Her bones are harder
than the drill?

28:56.861 --> 28:59.697
We ran a full body bone scan to find
the cause of hardening in the hip.

28:59.823 --> 29:00.990
No hot spots anywhere.

29:01.116 --> 29:02.659
Tracer could
have been inactive.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.160
So, I screwed up the test?

29:04.285 --> 29:05.870
There are so many ways
that could have happened.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.705
Maybe it was inactive,
maybe it didn't fully circulate...

29:07.831 --> 29:08.957
It circulated.
The camera picked up.

29:09.082 --> 29:13.336
Hey, hey. It's Christmas.
Why are you guys fighting?

29:14.504 --> 29:15.964
Why do you think
there are no hot spots?

29:16.089 --> 29:18.425
I did not screw up.
The density is consistent.

29:18.550 --> 29:21.970
Just means the density was consistent.
Doesn't mean it was cold.

29:22.095 --> 29:24.806
It's possible
all she has are hot spots.

29:24.931 --> 29:28.309
It's consistent because
her entire skeleton is turning to stone.

29:31.521 --> 29:33.356
Good for an
aspiring superhero.

29:33.690 --> 29:36.317
Fatal for a human
hoping to make it to Kwanzaa.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.987
It's got to be from
a carbonic anhydrase type 2 deficiency.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.197
It has free will. It doesn't have
to be anything it doesn't want to be.

29:41.322 --> 29:44.033
I meant if it's not
CA-2, well,

29:44.159 --> 29:46.953
none of the other causes
of osteopetrosis are treatable.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.084
You're right.
It's got to be.

29:53.209 --> 29:57.046
Go run her blood and hope that
your sunny optimism isn't misplaced.

30:04.387 --> 30:08.224
They accused Kutner of screwing up
a test because they hate him.

30:08.349 --> 30:09.267
You're surprised?

30:09.392 --> 30:10.477
That's the sort of crap
that happens

30:10.602 --> 30:12.312
when you mess
with people's heads.

30:12.437 --> 30:14.063
One day, he will
screw up a test.

30:15.106 --> 30:17.025
And if they don't accuse him of that
because they like him,

30:17.150 --> 30:18.401
someone could die.

30:20.778 --> 30:23.406
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere. I just know it hurts you.

30:26.826 --> 30:30.580
TAUB: CA-2 deficiency's a genetic
disorder that scrambles proteins.

30:30.705 --> 30:34.250
If the blood test is positive,
you'll need a bone marrow transplant.

30:34.375 --> 30:37.420
"Transplant" sounds like
a euphemism for "slim odds."

30:38.129 --> 30:40.632
Slim but not none.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.011
We're gonna need to
test Jane for a match.

30:45.595 --> 30:46.763
Don't you have donor banks?

30:46.888 --> 30:48.014
Jane is your best bet.

30:48.139 --> 30:50.016
The procedure is perfectly safe.
There's no risk.

30:50.141 --> 30:51.601
(SKEPTICALLY)
No risk?

30:52.101 --> 30:54.979
- Any surgery has...
- Then, don't tell me there's no risk.

30:55.772 --> 30:58.316
You're gonna tell me
there's no pain, either?

30:58.441 --> 30:59.400
The testing
will hurt a little.

30:59.526 --> 31:00.818
I'll be fine.

31:04.322 --> 31:07.742
If she doesn't do this
and you don't make it,

31:08.743 --> 31:11.037
she's gonna spend
the rest of her life blaming herself.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.876
(VOICE TREMBLING)
Mom, please.

31:20.004 --> 31:22.006
Find someone else.

31:23.341 --> 31:25.426
Let someone else take the risk.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.231
Donor bank turned up
a 49-year-old man in Cleveland

31:38.356 --> 31:40.358
who's a five out of six
HLA match.

31:40.483 --> 31:41.568
First flight out of
Cleveland leaves at...

31:41.693 --> 31:45.238
Why is a 49-year-old Cleveland man
a closer match than her daughter?

31:45.363 --> 31:47.699
He may not be.
Maggie didn't let us test her.

31:47.824 --> 31:50.493
- Why not?
- Pain, danger, risk of...

31:50.618 --> 31:52.370
Only reason to give
multiple reasons

31:52.495 --> 31:54.831
is you're searching
for what the person wants to hear.

31:58.418 --> 31:59.794
House.

32:08.344 --> 32:09.929
You're wrong about sainted Mommy.

32:10.054 --> 32:13.808
Don't care. You can forget the donor
bank. There's no CA-2 deficiency.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.852
Best we can do is
make her comfortable.

32:19.606 --> 32:21.065
Is that from Taub?

32:21.649 --> 32:22.859
Yes.

32:23.276 --> 32:24.777
Yes, it is.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.115
(SIGHS)

32:29.240 --> 32:30.450
Merry Christmas.

32:31.909 --> 32:33.703
Who's gonna tell the patient
she's dying?

32:35.705 --> 32:37.081
I will.

32:37.915 --> 32:41.210
And nobody leaves here
until we find out what killed her.

32:47.675 --> 32:50.303
Whatever she has is fatal.

32:50.428 --> 32:54.223
Makes no difference
if it's disease number 58 or 907.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.144
Are you guys mad at me?

32:58.269 --> 33:00.647
No. You had no choice.

33:00.772 --> 33:03.232
Of course I had a choice. You had
no choice once I made my choice.

33:03.358 --> 33:05.443
And now, I'm choosing
not to be mad at you.

33:05.568 --> 33:06.402
Why?

33:06.527 --> 33:08.321
Because it will
drive House nuts.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.284
Do you think that will make
your lives better or worse?

33:16.871 --> 33:18.915
I told my mom
I don't care what she thinks.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.875
I want you
to test my marrow.

33:25.797 --> 33:27.799
I can't be dying.

33:27.924 --> 33:29.008
Sure you can.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.009
You're wrong.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.804
You don't even know
what I have.

33:32.929 --> 33:36.849
What you have is
one last Christmas with your daughter.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.227
One last chance
to give her a present.

33:40.478 --> 33:42.230
The truth.

33:42.355 --> 33:45.149
It's inexpensive, highly valued.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.902
Never have to stand in line
to return it the day after Christmas.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.445
What are you talking about?

33:50.571 --> 33:52.156
A mother who's going to die

33:52.281 --> 33:55.326
doesn't refuse a donor test
because it might hurt.

33:55.451 --> 33:58.705
She refuses when she knows
it won't match.

33:59.789 --> 34:00.873
Which tends to happen

34:00.998 --> 34:04.836
when mother and daughter
aren't mother and daughter.

34:10.758 --> 34:14.595
I can do DNA tests
if you'd rather keep lying to me.

34:19.767 --> 34:21.686
I never wanted kids.

34:23.896 --> 34:26.899
I loved them,
but with my genes...

34:27.024 --> 34:30.737
I knew this woman, a drug addict.

34:32.947 --> 34:36.617
She got pregnant,
didn't want to have an abortion.

34:37.702 --> 34:41.205
But she also didn't want her daughter
to ever know who her real mother was.

34:42.582 --> 34:44.208
What she was.

34:45.877 --> 34:48.212
I promised never to tell.

34:53.301 --> 34:56.804
A promise to an addict is worth more
than a promise to your daughter?

34:56.929 --> 34:58.598
It'd be cruel to tell her.

34:58.723 --> 35:02.852
Right. She lives a lie.
You get to die a hypocrite.

35:07.273 --> 35:10.777
Mom? The doctors told me
what's happening.

35:10.902 --> 35:13.196
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

35:13.321 --> 35:14.989
I promise you.

35:15.698 --> 35:17.366
Doctors can be wrong.

35:17.950 --> 35:21.704
- There's still a chance I can beat...
- You really believe that?

35:27.376 --> 35:28.419
I do.

35:29.837 --> 35:32.715
No, Mom.
You're dying.

35:33.424 --> 35:35.885
Nobody can help you.

35:38.596 --> 35:41.182
It's not gonna be okay.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.205
That was cold.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.040
Yeah.

36:17.635 --> 36:19.804
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

36:28.062 --> 36:29.939
What did you get for Christmas?

36:30.064 --> 36:32.650
I got a watch, a vintage LP,

36:32.775 --> 36:35.069
and a second edition Conan Doyle.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.239
And if that wasn't bad enough,
my patient's dying.

36:38.614 --> 36:41.659
Christmas deaths in a hospital.
There's nothing more depressing.

36:41.784 --> 36:43.744
No one ever wants to go in
the patient's room.

36:43.870 --> 36:47.290
Even the candy stripers
leave them alone.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.834
But I saw
something amazing.

36:51.544 --> 36:53.254
Pure truth.

36:54.005 --> 36:56.507
She told her mother
that she was dying.

36:56.632 --> 36:58.718
Stripped her of all hope.

36:59.176 --> 37:01.554
That sounds horrible.

37:01.679 --> 37:04.849
It was like watching
some bizarre astronomical event

37:04.974 --> 37:06.517
that you know
you're never gonna see again.

37:06.642 --> 37:10.521
You tell people the cold, hard truth
all the time. You get off on it.

37:10.646 --> 37:11.981
Because I don't care.

37:12.106 --> 37:13.900
She cared.

37:14.025 --> 37:16.569
And she did it, anyway.

37:17.153 --> 37:19.530
She did it
because she cared.

37:21.198 --> 37:25.244
The angels of Christmas have finally
given House a present he can appreciate.

37:25.369 --> 37:26.245
Oh, don't ruin it.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.956
Don't pin this on Christ.
He's got enough nails in him.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.334
- Patient had to die...
- Why don't you take off that hat?

37:31.459 --> 37:33.753
It's Christmas.
It's a reindeer.

37:33.878 --> 37:35.963
It's a moose, on a Jew.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.965
Who cares?

37:39.133 --> 37:40.885
(SIGHS)

37:41.010 --> 37:42.261
Things have their place.

37:42.386 --> 37:45.097
You wouldn't hang dreidels
from a Christmas tree.

37:45.222 --> 37:47.183
You could.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.977
Things don't care.

37:54.023 --> 37:56.484
No, they don't.

37:59.737 --> 38:01.781
Happy solstice, House.

Bring me the eggnog

38:22.760 --> 38:24.470
House, if you have
something to say, say it.

38:24.595 --> 38:26.847
If you don't, give us a chance
to get home before Santa.

38:26.973 --> 38:28.432
Scrooge.

38:28.557 --> 38:30.476
Give the patient risperidone.

38:30.601 --> 38:33.229
That's an anti-psychotic.
She's dying. She's not crazy.

38:33.354 --> 38:36.691
I am gonna perform
a Christmas miracle.

(SINGING)
<i>Oh, tidings of comfort and joy</i>

38:42.822 --> 38:45.783
You said all the other causes
of osteopetrosis are fatal.

38:45.908 --> 38:49.578
Except for the one we discounted early
because it was impossible.

38:49.704 --> 38:53.374
When a fetus forms,
it's just a mass of cells.

38:53.749 --> 38:57.003
Breast tissue covers
extensive portions of the body.

38:57.128 --> 39:00.464
As the fetus develops,
most of this tissue recedes

39:00.589 --> 39:03.050
remaining only
in the fun places.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.386
But sometimes, extra breast tissue

39:05.511 --> 39:07.972
is left behind in places
where it doesn't belong.

39:08.097 --> 39:10.766
Risperidone does a lot of things.

39:10.891 --> 39:14.645
One is it makes breast tissue swell
so we can find it more easily.

39:14.770 --> 39:17.440
You're telling me
I could have breast cancer?

39:17.565 --> 39:19.650
Somewhere not in my breasts?
That doesn't make sense.

39:19.775 --> 39:22.695
Taub's parents
have a winter condo in Florida.

39:22.820 --> 39:23.946
They're still New Yorkers.

39:24.071 --> 39:25.906
- Actually, my parents...
- Don't care.

39:26.032 --> 39:27.074
I told a parable.

39:28.325 --> 39:31.245
Now, I'm gonna raise the dead.

39:32.705 --> 39:34.582
Give me that syringe.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.542
That's got to be a fat deposit.

39:36.667 --> 39:38.210
Yes, I could be wrong.

39:38.335 --> 39:41.297
If I am, she's dead.
So, shut up.

39:46.761 --> 39:47.595
What's that?

39:47.720 --> 39:51.265
Risperidone also
causes galactorrhea.

39:52.558 --> 39:55.561
What's that?
Galactic?

39:56.145 --> 39:57.605
Open your mouth.

39:58.189 --> 39:59.774
Relax.
You've had it before.

We'll cut out your mom's tumor
and start her on chemo.

All the rest of your symptoms
should go away.
