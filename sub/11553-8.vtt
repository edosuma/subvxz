00:14.863 --> 00:17.240
Trust me, I'm your friend.

00:22.996 --> 00:24.498
Bawk! Run for your lives!

00:27.083 --> 00:28.460
Finger five on it!

00:53.735 --> 00:57.113
No one knows who launched it
or what it's targeting?

00:57.196 --> 00:59.032
And so far, General,

00:59.115 --> 01:01.242
the missile's evaded
all international defenses.

01:01.325 --> 01:04.453
Well, nothing can elude our F-920s.

01:04.538 --> 01:05.830
They'll take it out!

01:43.952 --> 01:45.411
We failed.

01:46.580 --> 01:47.664
Yo, Kong-O!

01:47.747 --> 01:51.793
Ready to test your fighting skills against
this awesome holo-game Jonesy made for us?

01:55.171 --> 01:57.674
Okay. Game on.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.027
Remember the moves we taught you!

02:18.111 --> 02:20.655
Like this, Kong! Hi-yah!

02:20.739 --> 02:22.240
Kung Fu Viper!

02:25.368 --> 02:28.037
And Kung Fu Crane! Hyah!

02:35.419 --> 02:37.797
Sorry, Kong.
Game over. You lose.

02:40.717 --> 02:43.469
Afraid you're gonna need to move
a lot faster if you wanna win.

02:43.552 --> 02:46.765
You know what they say,
"Survival of the fittest."

02:46.848 --> 02:50.434
I think Kong's been eating too many
of tía Anita's banana treats.

02:52.270 --> 02:55.439
Well, we don't have to worry
about any more treats for a while.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.942
Tía Anita left with Amy
to get more supplies.

03:00.069 --> 03:02.238
Okay, so you ready for another round?

03:04.532 --> 03:07.493
All right! Kong's ready to win!

03:11.289 --> 03:13.582
This time, try Kung Fu Tiger!

03:18.713 --> 03:21.675
Or, better yet, Kung Fu Liger!

03:30.058 --> 03:32.310
Hey, guys, hold it down for a sec.
There's breaking news.

03:32.393 --> 03:33.436
What's going on?

03:33.519 --> 03:38.232
These startling images are
broadcasting from a Coast Guard vessel.

03:38.316 --> 03:39.442
Can't we do something?

03:39.525 --> 03:41.277
We'd never get there in time.

03:43.279 --> 03:44.572
But wait.

03:44.656 --> 03:46.407
Is that a bionobot chasing it down?

04:01.297 --> 04:04.759
For once, one of Richard's
dinosaurs did something good.

04:04.843 --> 04:06.219
It's totally amazing!

04:06.302 --> 04:08.805
Yes, amazing how that pterodactyl

04:08.888 --> 04:11.808
just happened to be
in the right place at the right time.

04:11.891 --> 04:13.768
Able to easily destroy the missile

04:13.852 --> 04:16.394
when none of
the International Defense Systems could.

04:19.023 --> 04:20.274
You don't think...

04:20.358 --> 04:22.568
Richard launched it.

04:22.651 --> 04:25.154
The question is... why?

04:25.238 --> 04:26.823
Let's see what they say.

04:26.906 --> 04:31.953
Countless lives were saved
thanks to Dr. Richard Remy's bionobot.

04:32.036 --> 04:33.997
What would have happened
if his dino messed up

04:34.080 --> 04:35.373
and didn't stop the missile in time?

04:36.665 --> 04:38.960
I don't even want to think about that.

04:39.961 --> 04:43.547
I just wish there was some way to know
for sure that he launched the missile,

04:43.631 --> 04:46.885
and if so,
what's Richard really up to this time?

04:46.968 --> 04:50.138
I'm betting the answers are stored
in Botila's robotic head.

04:50.221 --> 04:53.307
- Can you get in?
- You know hacking is not my style.

04:53.391 --> 04:54.726
Or mine either, Jonesy.

04:54.809 --> 04:57.645
I know it's wrong,
but there may be lives at stake.

04:57.729 --> 05:00.314
We need to know
what my brother's really planning.

05:01.983 --> 05:05.611
I'm offering fail-safe protection
for us all.

05:05.694 --> 05:07.321
I shudder to think what may have happened

05:07.405 --> 05:09.949
if my bionobot hadn't been
on training maneuvers.

05:10.033 --> 05:12.701
All those innocent people.

05:12.786 --> 05:17.791
Well, it simply proves that our current
military defenses are pitifully obsolete.

05:17.874 --> 05:21.002
But I can offer you the solution.

05:21.085 --> 05:24.213
Ladies and gentlemen...
behold the future!

05:24.297 --> 05:25.548
Botila, now!

06:08.257 --> 06:11.802
Look at them.
Like kids in a candy store.

06:11.886 --> 06:15.223
Nice job orchestrating
this little demonstration.

06:15.306 --> 06:17.308
Hmm. A compliment.

06:17.391 --> 06:19.018
I am unable to compute.

06:21.145 --> 06:22.981
Very funny, Botila.
Stop your...

06:23.064 --> 06:25.649
Someone is trying to gain access
to my data banks.

06:25.733 --> 06:29.988
- Who?
- I am unable to trace the source... yet.

06:33.824 --> 06:37.703
Dr. Remy, best demonstration
I have ever witnessed.

06:37.786 --> 06:40.664
Oh, thank you, General.

06:40.748 --> 06:44.793
Now imagine my bionobots
defending our entire country.

06:44.878 --> 06:48.672
Even patrolling our city streets,
protecting our citizens,

06:48.756 --> 06:51.800
and keeping our police
and soldiers out of danger.

06:51.885 --> 06:55.804
Sold! I'll advise the president
to order everything you have.

06:55.889 --> 06:59.433
Oh, I have so much to give.

07:09.277 --> 07:11.404
Way to go, Kong!

07:11.487 --> 07:12.947
But he's still not quite quick enough.

07:31.590 --> 07:34.302
Holo-carbs won't slow you down!

07:38.556 --> 07:41.059
It seems every government in the world

07:41.142 --> 07:44.395
has orders in
for your bionobotic Dino Defense Systems.

07:44.478 --> 07:48.607
After recent events,
everyone fears another missile attack.

07:48.691 --> 07:50.776
My creations ensure peace of mind.

07:50.859 --> 07:52.653
Oh, I can't believe this.

07:52.736 --> 07:56.324
Yeah, well, I can't believe
how hard it is to get into Botila's head.

07:56.407 --> 08:00.328
But doesn't that defeat the purpose
if everyone has it?

08:00.411 --> 08:04.040
On the contrary,
if everybody is equally armed,

08:04.123 --> 08:06.209
then no one will ever dare attack again.

08:06.292 --> 08:09.253
It's simple, really.
Peace through power.

08:10.171 --> 08:12.340
You'll never get in.

08:16.427 --> 08:18.012
Forget it.

08:18.096 --> 08:21.349
Botila's cyber defenses
are stronger than a two-ton gorilla!

08:21.432 --> 08:23.892
Kong's a little touchy right now.

08:23.977 --> 08:26.395
You've gotta keep trying, Jonesy.

08:26.479 --> 08:29.983
At this rate, you'll soon be
the richest person alive.

08:32.525 --> 08:38.116
Money is the last thing on my mind.
My goal is world peace.

08:38.823 --> 08:42.785
Your bro already has
advanced tech at his fingertips.

08:42.870 --> 08:46.040
I can't imagine how dangerous he'll be
with unlimited wealth, too.

08:46.124 --> 08:49.793
Hmm. If it was just about the money,
he could've robbed the Federal Reserve.

08:50.628 --> 08:53.172
This feels like
it's about something much bigger.

09:01.180 --> 09:05.018
Our production lines
are already running at maximum capacity.

09:05.101 --> 09:08.896
As sales increase,
we are struggling to keep up with demand.

09:08.980 --> 09:13.734
Who cares? My bionobots are
already stationed in enough countries.

09:13.817 --> 09:18.031
Not that they will able to defend against
what I have in mind for them.

09:25.288 --> 09:28.207
Looks like we may be out of a job soon.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.542
They're laying off police

09:29.625 --> 09:32.211
now that bionobots patrol the city.

09:32.295 --> 09:35.214
Race you to the jungle gym!

09:37.133 --> 09:40.636
Mommy, is it an earthquake?

10:00.156 --> 10:04.660
Oh, it's one of those police dinosaurs
we saw on TV.

10:04.743 --> 10:08.497
Yes, yes, it's wonderful, Timmy.
Now let's just let it do its job.

10:23.346 --> 10:26.682
News says Richard's bionobots
are at military bases

10:26.765 --> 10:28.601
around the world now.

10:28.684 --> 10:31.229
They're even policing
major cities, including ours.

10:31.312 --> 10:34.857
I wish I knew what he was really up to.
What aren't we seeing?

10:41.655 --> 10:43.616
Lucky's got pretty good technique.

10:43.699 --> 10:46.952
Yeah, Crouching Liger, Hidden Dragonfly!

10:49.330 --> 10:51.290
- Richard's hand in it.
- Say what?

10:51.374 --> 10:53.751
Once his dinos are in position
around the world,

10:53.834 --> 10:56.837
Richard steps in
and takes control of them.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.132
Creating his own new world order!

10:59.215 --> 11:01.217
I hope not.

11:01.300 --> 11:05.304
My brother's idea of a perfect world
is all super-machines and technology.

11:05.388 --> 11:07.473
Goodbye, Mother Nature.

11:07.556 --> 11:09.725
And Kong, and us, too.

11:09.808 --> 11:12.102
We need to find a way
to show the world that Richard,

11:12.186 --> 11:14.938
or at least his bionobots,
can't be trusted.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.064
Hmm...

11:16.149 --> 11:19.527
Botila's network is impossible
to remotely access.

11:19.610 --> 11:22.696
But maybe if I could get a peek
inside a dino's control panel,

11:22.780 --> 11:24.823
I could figure out a way
to shut them all down.

11:26.074 --> 11:27.576
Kong! Suit up!

11:28.827 --> 11:32.122
Looks like it's time to test
your new Kung Fu training!

11:36.377 --> 11:39.087
You're supposed to be
in Kung Fu Viper stealth mode.

11:39.172 --> 11:41.215
As in silent as a ninja,

11:41.299 --> 11:43.301
not a giant cookie monstro.

11:43.384 --> 11:44.927
But not too quiet.

11:45.010 --> 11:47.888
We need Kong to flush out the dino
so I can get into its head.

11:47.971 --> 11:49.432
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.563
Remember your training!

12:00.568 --> 12:01.819
Use Kung Fu Crane!

12:05.072 --> 12:06.949
No! That's Kung Fu Liger!

12:07.032 --> 12:08.992
I mean Tiger, try...

12:10.953 --> 12:13.038
Kung Fu Viper!

12:16.542 --> 12:18.168
You're confusing him.

12:23.257 --> 12:26.093
Wow. What kinda Kung Fu was that?

12:26.176 --> 12:30.055
That, my friends, is called Kong Fu!
You go, brother!

12:32.641 --> 12:35.811
Good job, but now I think
you better keep it down in case the...

12:35.894 --> 12:37.020
Too late!

12:52.661 --> 12:54.162
So what do you think, Jonesy?

12:54.247 --> 12:55.956
I think Richard programed a fail-safe

12:56.039 --> 12:57.666
in case anyone tries this!

12:57.750 --> 12:59.502
Run!

13:03.547 --> 13:06.550
Nothing left to do here.

13:06.634 --> 13:07.885
Time to go, bro!

13:15.976 --> 13:17.645
Smooth moves, big guy!

13:17.728 --> 13:20.147
Now let's make like
a Kung Fu Crane and fly!

13:26.612 --> 13:28.864
It would appear Mr. Jones

13:28.947 --> 13:31.158
is attempting to alter
the unit's programing.

13:31.742 --> 13:33.744
Why are they always meddling?

13:33.827 --> 13:36.289
It would not take a rocket scientist

13:36.372 --> 13:40.208
to deduce your ultimate goal
is not really world peace.

13:40.293 --> 13:43.921
Remind me to deactivate
your sarcasm module.

13:45.548 --> 13:47.883
It doesn't matter.
They're too late.

13:47.966 --> 13:51.679
My army of bionobots is already
in position around the world.

13:52.721 --> 13:54.682
Within 24 hours,

13:54.765 --> 13:59.687
I will possess absolute
and unchallenged global domination.

14:06.569 --> 14:09.780
There has to be something
we can do to stop Richard.

14:09.863 --> 14:12.491
No way Kong can take on dinos
all around the world.

14:12.575 --> 14:15.536
There still might be a way...
but it's not gonna be easy.

14:17.538 --> 14:19.290
Is it ever?

14:19.373 --> 14:23.085
Gotta figure all Richard's bionobots
are linked to a central command console.

14:23.168 --> 14:25.338
- That could be anywhere.
- Sure.

14:25.421 --> 14:27.548
But I bet it's somewhere close to Richard.

14:27.631 --> 14:30.843
Somewhere safe, like his walking,
talking command center.

14:30.926 --> 14:32.303
Botila.

14:32.386 --> 14:33.929
Right. So...

14:34.012 --> 14:35.473
We're running out of time.

14:35.556 --> 14:38.016
Richard's machines are in position
to take over the world

14:38.100 --> 14:39.602
unless we can stop them.

14:39.685 --> 14:43.314
- So what are we waiting for?
- Yeah, piece of cake.

14:43.397 --> 14:45.273
Yo, Kong-O, ready to roll?

14:47.943 --> 14:50.738
Botila!
I know you can hear me!

14:50.821 --> 14:53.741
Time for a showdown.
Just you and me.

14:53.824 --> 14:56.076
But I did bring my pal, Kong,

14:56.159 --> 14:59.872
just in case you decide
you can't take me without dino backup.

15:01.457 --> 15:03.876
I can take him with one hand.

15:04.418 --> 15:08.422
Use two...
and all the dinosaurs left on the island.

15:08.506 --> 15:12.009
I want Kong and company eliminated
once and for all.

15:12.092 --> 15:14.512
Then no one can stop me.

15:17.180 --> 15:20.684
Ordering all units to attack Kong now!

15:23.186 --> 15:25.063
Okay, bro, you know
what you need to do, right?

15:28.526 --> 15:31.362
Guess facing me alone
was too much for you, Botila!

15:33.531 --> 15:36.367
Oh, you're all mine, Mr. Jones.

15:55.969 --> 15:57.888
- Whoa!
- Look out! Watch it!

15:57.971 --> 15:59.264
- Duck!
- Ahhh!

15:59.347 --> 16:01.600
Come on, we better take
cover down here...

16:03.143 --> 16:05.729
Too late!

16:06.980 --> 16:08.190
Hang on!

16:08.273 --> 16:10.901
Whoa! Hanging on!

16:10.984 --> 16:12.861
Don't want to become dino chow!

16:12.945 --> 16:14.988
Lucky these guys can't climb.

16:20.035 --> 16:22.705
Yeah, but that slimy
giant squid thingy can!

16:24.164 --> 16:25.708
Any time now, Kong!

16:37.052 --> 16:39.179
Calculating speed of descent.

16:39.262 --> 16:41.474
My titanium shell may not withstand...

16:44.059 --> 16:45.894
Good save, bud!

16:46.645 --> 16:48.647
For once, I concur.

16:48.731 --> 16:52.400
Kong! Take out the other two flying dinos
so Jonesy can get to work.

16:52.485 --> 16:54.737
Hurry, Kong!
We've got company!

17:07.249 --> 17:09.084
Put me down, you big...

17:10.794 --> 17:13.005
Primitive, but understood.

17:21.513 --> 17:23.223
Awesome Kong Fu move!

17:27.685 --> 17:30.438
Yo, Kong! Bring me up
so I can get to work on Botila!

17:32.399 --> 17:34.026
Hold out your arm
and open your control panel.

17:34.109 --> 17:37.112
- Never.
- Look, either you cooperate, Ms. Bot,

17:37.195 --> 17:40.991
or my friend Kong here puts the squeeze
on that titanium shell of yours.

17:43.243 --> 17:46.997
Fine. But good luck figuring out
the self-destruct code in time.

17:51.752 --> 17:53.253
Worth a try.

17:54.755 --> 17:56.757
Now or never, Jonesy!

18:00.553 --> 18:03.013
Right, no pressure.

18:03.096 --> 18:04.807
Maybe if I try this...

18:04.890 --> 18:05.974
Whoops.

18:06.058 --> 18:07.768
Not again!

18:07.851 --> 18:09.687
Somebody catch it!

18:09.770 --> 18:11.313
Huh?

18:11.396 --> 18:13.398
I got it! Oh, yuck!

18:13.481 --> 18:15.609
We have her, Jonesy!

18:15.693 --> 18:17.069
In your dreams!

18:18.111 --> 18:21.865
Give Jonesy the code
or you're going down, too.

18:24.201 --> 18:25.285
Now, Botila!

18:26.537 --> 18:30.624
TR2050-BOTIL...

18:30.708 --> 18:31.834
A.

19:13.125 --> 19:16.003
I certainly hope
we can get our money back.

19:16.086 --> 19:20.883
Otherwise, all we've got is
a very expensive dinosaur junkyard.

19:21.592 --> 19:23.594
Reports are coming in
from around the world

19:23.677 --> 19:26.972
that all your defense systems
have completely failed.

19:27.055 --> 19:29.767
What can I say?
They were hacked.

19:29.850 --> 19:31.393
It's a scary state of affairs

19:31.476 --> 19:34.187
that even the most highly advanced
tech in the world isn't safe

19:34.271 --> 19:36.899
from vicious cyber-attacks.

19:36.982 --> 19:42.029
Well, humiliation aside...
this must be costing you a fortune.

19:42.905 --> 19:44.698
No comment.

19:44.782 --> 19:47.618
Okay, that's a first.

19:51.789 --> 19:55.542
Who wants some of Anita's
super-healthy banana treats?

19:58.003 --> 19:59.296
It's okay, Kong.

19:59.379 --> 20:03.216
Turns out tía Anita makes all her treats
without any sugar.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.135
Just fresh bananas.

20:05.218 --> 20:08.055
Besides, you totally proved
you're super-fit.

20:08.138 --> 20:10.182
That's for sure. Hey, buddy!

20:10.265 --> 20:13.727
Teach me some of your Kong Fu moves?

20:18.774 --> 20:20.776
- Me, too.
- Hey, I'm in!

20:20.859 --> 20:22.527
I coulda used them with Botila.

20:24.321 --> 20:25.823
I wonder if Richard knows

20:25.906 --> 20:28.826
what really brought
his new world order down.

20:30.077 --> 20:32.705
How could you let this happen?

20:32.788 --> 20:35.332
I was on the verge of becoming so rich

20:35.415 --> 20:38.543
I could have bought
every last natural resource on the planet

20:38.626 --> 20:40.462
to make my bionics.

20:40.545 --> 20:45.508
Thanks to my unprecedented legal mind,
the contracts were titanium-clad.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.094
No refunds.

20:47.177 --> 20:50.180
- No refunds?
- Correct.

20:50.764 --> 20:52.808
Did I get my head back on straight?

20:54.101 --> 20:57.104
Kong and his crew certainly made
a mockery out of you.

20:57.187 --> 20:59.022
What are you talking about?

21:00.232 --> 21:02.192
They will pay.

21:02.275 --> 21:04.111
Yes, they will.

21:04.194 --> 21:08.573
Because I am now wealthy enough
to make all my dreams come true.

21:08.656 --> 21:09.825
Thanks to me.

21:09.908 --> 21:14.287
Including finally finishing off
my brother's filthy ape.

21:14.371 --> 21:18.375
And I know exactly
how we are going to do it.
