00:40.435 --> 00:43.035
Remember me?

00:43.037 --> 00:44.738
Yeah?

00:44.740 --> 00:47.741
What's wrong with your friend?

00:47.743 --> 00:49.879
He's dead.

00:56.817 --> 00:59.519
What did I tell you? Huh?

00:59.521 --> 01:01.086
It's cold.

01:01.088 --> 01:04.791
Yeah, it's cold.
Now your friend dead,

01:04.793 --> 01:07.894
'cause you did nothing about it.

01:07.896 --> 01:10.132
What did I tell you?

01:10.865 --> 01:14.234
What did I tell you?!

01:14.236 --> 01:19.175
When are you gonna get off
your ass, huh, and do something?

01:22.010 --> 01:25.114
If you don't,
you're gonna be next.

02:19.433 --> 02:20.566
Go!

02:20.568 --> 02:23.136
Whoa.

02:23.138 --> 02:26.075
Let's go, let's go!

02:46.493 --> 02:48.330
Let's go.

03:28.569 --> 03:31.006
Let's go. Go.

04:02.069 --> 04:03.703
Go, go, go!

04:03.705 --> 04:05.374
Go, go, go!

04:20.487 --> 04:22.490
Fuck.

04:30.531 --> 04:33.067
Fuck.

04:35.569 --> 04:38.072
Jesus fucking Christ.

04:40.675 --> 04:42.207
I got nothing.

04:42.209 --> 04:44.512
No? There's three down.

04:45.447 --> 04:47.012
He can't be fucking far.

04:47.014 --> 04:49.117
So let's go regroup back
at base, okay?

06:55.110 --> 06:59.144
Yeah, do you want to go
a little bit further?

06:59.146 --> 07:01.416
Yeah, that's good.

07:05.687 --> 07:07.152
How was your weekend?

07:07.154 --> 07:08.253
I was good.

07:08.255 --> 07:11.324
They're saying we're getting
some new... What's this?

07:11.326 --> 07:13.462
Oh, come on.
We're on air in three!

07:17.798 --> 07:20.733
Terror <i>
attacks from ISIS again today.</i>

07:20.735 --> 07:22.502
<i>In Berlin, Germany,</i>

07:22.504 --> 07:26.505
<i>a suicide bomber
killed 75 people in the subway.</i>

07:26.507 --> 07:27.574
ISIS <i>took</i>
<i>responsibility</i>

07:27.576 --> 07:28.875
<i>for the explosion,
but investigators</i>

07:28.877 --> 07:31.676
<i>are still trying to determine
who the suspects are</i>

07:31.678 --> 07:33.512
<i>and if there is
a refugee connection.</i>

07:33.514 --> 07:35.447
Germany's <i>anti-immigration party</i>

07:35.449 --> 07:37.750
<i>is continuing to rally support
in light of the recent attacks.</i>

07:37.752 --> 07:40.685
Paris <i>
suffered</i> another mass shooting,

07:40.687 --> 07:41.753
<i>and in London a car bomb</i>

07:41.755 --> 07:44.423
<i>has destroyed
the entrance to Big Ben.</i>

07:44.425 --> 07:46.759
Eleven casualties
counted so far.

07:46.761 --> 07:48.094
And
<i>another hotel bombing</i>

07:48.096 --> 07:51.230
<i>in Islamabad has occurred,
with dozens of casualties.</i>

07:51.232 --> 07:53.699
<i>Details are still sketchy
as emergency personnel</i>

07:53.701 --> 07:54.899
<i>are still working the scene.</i>

07:54.901 --> 07:57.370
Terror <i>threats in the U.S.</i>
<i>have also increased.</i>

07:57.372 --> 08:00.438
<i>In Colorado, a suicide bombing
was prevented at a busy mall,</i>

08:00.440 --> 08:03.509
<i>when a 19-year-old man's vest
failed to detonate.</i>

08:03.511 --> 08:05.310
He's <i>now</i>
<i>in custody,</i>

08:05.312 --> 08:06.411
<i>but three other suspects</i>

08:06.413 --> 08:08.481
<i>fled the scene
and are still at large.</i>

08:08.483 --> 08:11.817
In <i>Boston, a veteran has
opened fire in a military base,</i>

08:11.819 --> 08:17.389
<i>killing 15 soldiers before
turning the gun on himself.</i>

08:17.391 --> 08:20.259
The President has called
these terror attacks

08:20.261 --> 08:22.695
the biggest test
of Western civilization

08:22.697 --> 08:25.565
after the Second World War.

08:25.567 --> 08:29.671
<i>Air strikes in the Middle
East will continue.</i>

08:31.940 --> 08:33.138
<i>Sadly, these stories...</i>

08:33.140 --> 08:37.379
seem to be occurring and are
an all-too-common occurrence.

09:02.636 --> 09:04.705
Oh, my god.

09:15.950 --> 09:18.187
The President.

09:29.998 --> 09:32.931
<i>The
President of the United States</i>

09:32.933 --> 09:35.603
<i>is dead.</i>

09:40.807 --> 09:42.407
<i>While giving a press conference</i>

09:42.409 --> 09:43.542
in front of the Senate,

09:43.544 --> 09:47.313
the President, Vice President
and Secretary of Defense

09:47.315 --> 09:49.785
<i>were shot.</i>

09:51.451 --> 09:54.456
The nation is in shock.

10:03.730 --> 10:08.033
<i>You know
about Team Billy...</i>

10:08.035 --> 10:10.469
<i>...Team David...</i>

10:10.471 --> 10:12.905
<i>...Team Flynn.</i>

10:12.907 --> 10:16.378
<i>Happy childhood memories.</i>

10:16.778 --> 10:18.743
<i>Proud Parents.</i>

10:18.745 --> 10:21.546
<i>Future plans.</i>

10:21.548 --> 10:23.049
<i>"My kid will run the world.</i>

10:23.051 --> 10:28.054
<i>The sky is the limit.
Everything is possible."</i>

10:28.056 --> 10:29.189
But it's not.

10:29.191 --> 10:32.525
Parents give hope and trust
against better knowledge.

10:32.527 --> 10:34.426
Flynn will get older...

10:34.428 --> 10:36.329
<i>and will settle for less.</i>

10:36.331 --> 10:39.931
<i>He will be poor or almost poor
and we will...</i>

10:39.933 --> 10:42.701
we'll be proud that he makes it
into the middle class,

10:42.703 --> 10:45.871
<i>he works, he gets a family.
Finally...</i>

10:45.873 --> 10:47.640
<i>cannot move, so...</i>

10:47.642 --> 10:50.542
it's over before it began,

10:50.544 --> 10:53.514
what Team Flynn was all about.

11:14.034 --> 11:16.469
I'm so tired.

11:16.471 --> 11:18.103
I've done my duty.

11:18.105 --> 11:19.872
I've just killed
the most powerful person

11:19.874 --> 11:21.940
on the planet
and all his corrupt partners.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.509
<i>I've killed so many people
in my life</i>

11:24.511 --> 11:27.479
<i>and no one
can judge me for that.</i>

11:27.481 --> 11:29.882
I tried to show you a world
for what it is

11:29.884 --> 11:31.117
and you stood idly by.

11:31.119 --> 11:34.420
You people,
you're obsessed with violence.

11:34.422 --> 11:35.454
You're focused on my body count

11:35.456 --> 11:37.723
<i>rather than
what I was telling you.</i>

11:37.725 --> 11:39.592
So everything
has remained the same.

11:39.594 --> 11:43.661
The prison and the gun laws
have not changed.

11:43.663 --> 11:44.964
<i>Lobbyists still run Washington.</i>

11:44.966 --> 11:47.967
<i>The rich are getting richer</i>
and the poor are getting poorer.

11:47.969 --> 11:50.469
Our health and habitat
are being compromised

11:50.471 --> 11:53.839
as the corporate elite
rape and pillage the Earth.

11:53.841 --> 11:55.741
<i>The majority
of the world's problems</i>

11:55.743 --> 11:58.411
<i>are a direct result
of American policy.</i>

11:58.413 --> 12:00.879
You think this is
the greatest country on Earth?

12:00.881 --> 12:02.781
It never was!

12:02.783 --> 12:05.785
You think it's a bastion
of opportunity and freedom?

12:05.787 --> 12:06.953
It never was!

12:06.955 --> 12:09.722
<i>Poor Europeans, criminals,
scumbags boarded</i>

12:09.724 --> 12:12.023
<i>a boat rife with disease
and they made</i>

12:12.025 --> 12:15.627
<i>a journey to America.
They began plundering the land,</i>

12:15.629 --> 12:16.962
raping and killing the natives,

12:16.964 --> 12:21.499
cultivating the land with slaves
stolen from Africa!

12:21.501 --> 12:23.669
<i>Today, 24% of the world
see America</i>

12:23.671 --> 12:26.906
<i>as the greatest threat
to world peace today,</i>

12:26.908 --> 12:30.876
followed by China at 6%
and Russia at 2%.

12:30.878 --> 12:32.677
Believe what you want,
but the world's opinion

12:32.679 --> 12:36.817
is becoming stronger than
American imperialist propaganda.

13:40.780 --> 13:42.714
Moments
<i>ago, as the entire world</i>

13:42.716 --> 13:44.017
<i>mourns the loss
of its political leadership,</i>

13:44.019 --> 13:48.587
<i>Nation Affairs Secretary Miller
was sworn in as President.</i>

13:48.589 --> 13:50.089
Stepping into the position,
he stated,

13:50.091 --> 13:52.925
"The country will not rest
before the murderers are found."

13:52.927 --> 13:53.993
<i>Multiple organizations
are searching</i>

13:53.995 --> 13:56.195
<i>for the murderers
of the President.</i>

13:56.197 --> 13:58.129
The NSA, CIA, Homeland Security,

13:58.131 --> 14:01.633
<i>FBI, and even local police,
are working together,</i>

14:01.635 --> 14:05.103
and individually,
on various leads and suspects.

14:17.051 --> 14:19.651
Alright uh, hey,
everyone just stop

14:19.653 --> 14:21.619
what you're doing
just for two seconds.

14:21.621 --> 14:22.521
We just want
to introduce ourselves, alright?

14:22.523 --> 14:23.789
I'm Agent Molokai
and this is Agent Jones.

14:23.791 --> 14:26.758
We've been put in charge, we're
overseeing this investigation.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.160
Now, we all know why we're here.

14:28.162 --> 14:30.329
To find and detain
the perpetrators responsible

14:30.331 --> 14:32.131
for the assassination
of the President.

14:32.133 --> 14:35.568
Now, all you guys have been
asked to be on this unit

14:35.570 --> 14:37.636
because you're the best
at what you do.

14:37.638 --> 14:39.905
Have patience.
It's gonna take time,

14:39.907 --> 14:42.807
but we are gonna find
whoever did this.

14:42.809 --> 14:44.142
Now, let's get to work.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.612
You got any questions
that has anything to do

14:46.614 --> 14:48.046
with tech stuff,
this is Agent Murray.

14:48.048 --> 14:50.315
He's the brains behind
the computers, alright?

14:50.317 --> 14:52.984
You need anything,
you go ask him.

14:52.986 --> 14:54.686
Jesus Christ.

14:59.659 --> 15:02.795
I got it. White House
observation footage

15:02.797 --> 15:04.696
for 24 hours leading up
to the assassination.

15:04.698 --> 15:06.699
Just the White House?

15:06.701 --> 15:08.132
- Murray.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

15:08.134 --> 15:10.335
We need video footage
from every surveillance camera

15:10.337 --> 15:12.838
within a 50-mile radius
from the White House.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.839
- Everything!
- I'm talking gas stations,

15:14.841 --> 15:17.609
parking lots,
buses, trains, traffic lights.

15:17.611 --> 15:19.044
Everything. Anything.
Everything.

15:19.046 --> 15:20.345
Okay.

15:20.347 --> 15:22.948
If you are a cop or a soldier,

15:22.950 --> 15:27.685
you are a tool for the 0.1%,
not the general public.

15:27.687 --> 15:31.323
There's no land of the free
and home of the brave.

15:31.325 --> 15:36.097
If you're a soldier, you are
a puppet... and nothing else.

17:08.221 --> 17:10.455
<i>I have a son now.</i>

17:10.458 --> 17:12.990
His name is Billy.

17:12.992 --> 17:15.059
Like most parents,
I believe that my son

17:15.060 --> 17:17.395
has the ability
to rule the world.

17:17.396 --> 17:18.530
<i>To create a great impact.</i>

17:18.531 --> 17:21.799
<i>To follow in my footsteps
in many ways.</i>

17:21.800 --> 17:24.469
He will be taught
that anything is possible,

17:24.471 --> 17:26.337
but the truth is, that's a lie.

17:26.339 --> 17:29.107
Parents are naive. They give
hope to their children,

17:29.109 --> 17:32.244
because it's what they'd hoped
for themselves.

17:32.246 --> 17:35.814
<i>Truth is, my son
will likely fall in the line</i>

17:35.816 --> 17:37.749
<i>with the majority,
just barely classified</i>

17:37.751 --> 17:40.084
<i>into a rapidly diminishing
middle class.</i>

17:40.086 --> 17:44.422
Let's face it, if he's not
the 1%, he will be poor,

17:44.424 --> 17:45.725
struggling to get through life.

17:45.727 --> 17:50.161
<i>He will work into his old age.
Work his ass off in vain</i>

17:50.163 --> 17:52.498
<i>to support his family,
trying to get ahead</i>

17:52.500 --> 17:55.767
<i>and leave something behind
for his children's future,</i>

17:55.769 --> 17:56.869
<i>scratching and clawing</i>

17:56.871 --> 17:59.771
<i>to make ends meet
for his entire life.</i>

17:59.773 --> 18:02.074
And eventually
his body's gonna break down.

18:02.076 --> 18:04.977
Medical insurance will be
unattainable and then...

18:04.979 --> 18:08.546
<i>his mind follows, deteriorates.
And then,</i>

18:08.548 --> 18:10.984
he dies.

18:15.990 --> 18:18.123
It is what it is.

18:18.125 --> 18:22.126
Eventually, everything...
finds its end.

18:22.128 --> 18:26.064
In the beginning,
I thought it was all about me.

18:26.066 --> 18:27.498
I saw everyone
around me stealing,

18:27.500 --> 18:31.068
<i>taking for themselves without
any regard for anyone else.</i>

18:31.070 --> 18:35.274
<i>I saw so much greed,
selfishness, separation,</i>

18:35.276 --> 18:36.975
<i>that I wanted to embody
all those things</i>

18:36.977 --> 18:40.077
<i>in a way that
no one could forget.</i>

18:40.079 --> 18:42.815
So when people saw
what I was doing,

18:42.817 --> 18:45.984
<i>it'd be like they were looking
into a mirror.</i>

18:45.986 --> 18:48.790
And they'd be forced to change.

19:46.913 --> 19:48.080
I wish that we lived in a world

19:48.082 --> 19:49.914
where there was no human
or animal abuse.

19:49.916 --> 19:51.182
Where we shared
the planet's resources,

19:51.184 --> 19:54.119
<i>we used the wind from the
oceans, the sun from the Sahara</i>

19:54.121 --> 19:56.354
<i>to make energy
for all of us together.</i>

19:56.356 --> 19:58.957
<i>Where our food
is distributed to everyone</i>

19:58.959 --> 20:01.426
<i>and no one starves
and nothing is wasted.</i>

20:01.428 --> 20:03.629
Where no one is blinded anymore
by religion

20:03.631 --> 20:05.396
and we listen
to science and facts

20:05.398 --> 20:08.467
to really focus on the problems
we all collectively face.

20:08.469 --> 20:10.102
Like climate change!

20:10.104 --> 20:12.970
<i>I wish for a world
where we can all live in peace,</i>

20:12.972 --> 20:14.439
where there's no wars, there's
<i>no weapons,</i>

20:14.441 --> 20:16.107
<i>there's no
violence!</i>

20:16.109 --> 20:18.376
<i>But that can't happen!</i>

20:18.378 --> 20:22.216
That can't happen!
That won't ever happen!

20:41.101 --> 20:42.601
The President,
the Vice President,

20:42.603 --> 20:44.469
the Secretary of Defense
were killed,

20:44.471 --> 20:45.970
each one with a single shot.

20:45.972 --> 20:47.672
<i>Analysis of security
video footage</i>

20:47.674 --> 20:50.074
<i>from the plaza
found no indication</i>

20:50.076 --> 20:52.044
of shooters close by,
leading authorities

20:52.046 --> 20:53.545
to believe they are dealing

20:53.547 --> 20:56.113
<i>with trained elite snipers.</i>

20:56.115 --> 20:58.016
All the registered
gun owners checked out.

20:58.018 --> 21:01.085
We don't have a weapon.
But what we do have

21:01.087 --> 21:03.689
is a location from where
the weapon was fired.

21:03.691 --> 21:07.124
It happened 1.2 miles
from the White House,

21:07.126 --> 21:10.194
on 7th Avenue,
on top of a parade.

21:10.196 --> 21:12.096
That's one hell of a shot.

21:12.098 --> 21:14.432
Shot? He shot three.
He hit all three.

21:14.434 --> 21:16.034
Three kills.

21:16.036 --> 21:17.436
What if it's three shooters?

21:17.438 --> 21:20.171
It's a possibility.
This person or these persons

21:20.173 --> 21:22.074
knew what they were doing.

21:22.076 --> 21:24.709
You need to check the other
vantage points around that area.

21:24.711 --> 21:27.312
- Alright.
- Yeah. Get it. Thanks.

21:27.314 --> 21:30.181
Make a shot like that,
it's probably ex-military.

21:30.183 --> 21:32.718
Probably five people in the
world can make a shot like that.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.053
We need to find a list
of every soldier

21:35.055 --> 21:37.689
that was discharged
suffering of PTSD.

21:37.691 --> 21:41.129
Can you imagine
if it's one of ours?

21:41.729 --> 21:44.196
Don't even go there.

21:44.198 --> 21:47.365
I'm gonna cross-reference
all the flight manifests

21:47.367 --> 21:48.632
<i>with anyone
that might've been involved</i>

21:48.634 --> 21:50.267
<i>in military
or anything like that.</i>

21:50.269 --> 21:52.336
<i>I wanna cross-reference it
with anyone</i>

21:52.338 --> 21:54.672
that could wield a gun,
basically, <i>that was coming</i>

21:54.674 --> 21:59.010
<i>in and out of Washington
that day, because, I mean...</i>

21:59.012 --> 22:01.645
...that's not
your average shooter.

22:01.647 --> 22:03.951
If it is one person.

22:08.521 --> 22:10.555
Two <i>weeks after the
assassination of the President,</i>

22:10.557 --> 22:13.424
<i>the Vice President
and the Secretary of Defense,</i>

22:13.426 --> 22:16.460
ISIS claims responsibility for
the attack, although experts...

22:16.462 --> 22:20.332
<i>see no indication
of their involvement.</i>

22:20.334 --> 22:23.134
Now,
we gotta check every hotel,

22:23.136 --> 22:26.238
every flight manifest
for any Arabs, Iraqis,

22:26.240 --> 22:27.305
- Muslim jihadists.
- I've been checking 'em...

22:27.307 --> 22:29.708
- Anyone from the Middle East.
- I've been checking.

22:29.710 --> 22:31.075
The only Arab is, like,

22:31.077 --> 22:33.111
selling kebabs
on the side of the street.

22:33.113 --> 22:36.047
Why are we playing that card?

22:36.049 --> 22:39.419
Fucking souvlaki joint...

22:40.621 --> 22:43.124
I don't know.

22:44.290 --> 22:47.427
I feel like I'm watching ants.

23:12.586 --> 23:15.420
- <i>Dad?</i>
- Bill.

23:15.422 --> 23:19.423
<i>Stop what you're doing,
right now! Please.</i>

23:19.425 --> 23:22.526
Let me be the man, okay?
Okay? Let me be the man.

23:22.528 --> 23:25.130
- You're <i>sick. Okay?</i>
- Put Mom on the phone.

23:25.132 --> 23:29.366
- Son!
- Dad!! Put Mom on the phone.

23:29.368 --> 23:32.269
I <i>can't put your mom</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

23:32.271 --> 23:34.338
<i>She flipped the car.</i>

23:34.340 --> 23:39.311
<i>She held on for awhile
in the hospital...</i>

23:39.313 --> 23:40.812
<i>...asking to see you, Bill.</i>

23:40.814 --> 23:43.582
<i>I tried to find ya.
I did everything I could.</i>

23:43.584 --> 23:45.816
<i>But you just disappeared
without a trace.</i>

23:45.818 --> 23:48.522
Okay, okay, okay. I get it.

23:50.190 --> 23:53.357
- Bill!
- Dad, I gotta go.

23:53.359 --> 23:55.326
Bill, <i>what's happening?!</i>

23:55.328 --> 23:58.499
<i>Why are you doing this, Bill?</i>

24:22.455 --> 24:24.424
Fuck.

24:29.829 --> 24:31.631
Fuck.

24:37.503 --> 24:38.870
Yes, sir.

24:38.872 --> 24:41.573
Understood.

24:41.575 --> 24:44.676
I got the Deputy Director
breathing down my neck.

24:44.678 --> 24:45.744
They want results

24:45.746 --> 24:47.946
- like yesterday.
- What...?

24:47.948 --> 24:49.648
How long do we have?

24:49.650 --> 24:52.316
Because I'm trying to do manual
facial recognitions with

24:52.318 --> 24:53.517
people right now.

24:53.519 --> 24:54.753
It's gonna take us up to 20
years to be able to do that.

24:54.755 --> 24:57.488
I think they don't want us to
find whoever we're looking for.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.924
That's bullshit. You know
what we're trying to do here.

24:59.926 --> 25:02.193
- It doesn't work!
- Guys, stop. Stop.

25:02.195 --> 25:04.962
Enough of this archaic
bullshit, okay?

25:04.964 --> 25:07.632
I'm gonna turn 20 years
into two weeks.

25:07.634 --> 25:08.566
What do you got, Murray?

25:08.568 --> 25:10.634
It's a new program
and it's gonna help us.

25:10.636 --> 25:13.738
Now, what this program does
is it can scan every face.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.240
We can go through
every single person

25:16.242 --> 25:17.741
that's entered Washington D.C.

25:17.743 --> 25:18.677
leading up to the assassination.

25:18.679 --> 25:20.478
It's gonna take some time,
but pretty soon,

25:20.480 --> 25:23.215
we'll be able to identify
every single person

25:23.217 --> 25:24.982
on all these cameras.

25:24.984 --> 25:26.651
Once a person clears,
they're cleared.

25:26.653 --> 25:29.688
But eventually,
we're gonna find our culprit.

25:29.690 --> 25:32.423
We're gonna find the person
who assassinated the President.

25:32.425 --> 25:34.258
You can bring up
their IDs right away?

25:34.260 --> 25:35.227
All their identification, yeah.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.495
So we can narrow it down
so we can find people

25:37.497 --> 25:41.333
with outstanding passports,
like warrants for arrest

25:41.335 --> 25:42.633
or anything, around
the same area, right?

25:42.635 --> 25:43.969
Yeah, if you need
a specific search.

25:43.971 --> 25:45.636
Let's do that.

25:45.638 --> 25:46.505
When each one of these
are scanned

25:46.507 --> 25:48.440
when the file comes up,
is it backed up?

25:48.442 --> 25:49.975
- Absolutely.
- I want those files printed

25:49.977 --> 25:52.978
and everybody going through
to see if we missed anything.

25:52.980 --> 25:53.778
Okay.

25:53.780 --> 25:56.014
Thank you!
I'm gonna get started.

25:56.016 --> 25:58.783
Davidson, come with me
in my office. You, too.

25:58.785 --> 26:00.588
This is good.

26:31.050 --> 26:34.486
Oh, he's almost waking up.

26:34.488 --> 26:36.423
He's up.

26:37.356 --> 26:39.527
Oh, my...

26:43.430 --> 26:47.798
I don't think I've ever seen...
one up close,

26:47.800 --> 26:49.633
like this close before.

26:51.570 --> 26:55.739
I can't believe that...
we did this.

26:55.741 --> 26:57.074
I know.

26:57.076 --> 27:00.314
It's the best thing
we've ever done.

27:02.348 --> 27:04.718
The best thing.

27:07.453 --> 27:09.386
I want him to wake up.

27:09.388 --> 27:10.488
You don't.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.922
- Yeah.
- You don't know

27:11.924 --> 27:13.057
you can put him back to sleep.

27:13.059 --> 27:14.793
I don't think he's gonna scream.

27:14.795 --> 27:15.460
Oh, he...

27:15.462 --> 27:16.260
That's all he's been doing.

27:16.262 --> 27:17.996
I know how to put him
to sleep.

27:19.365 --> 27:20.768
I can put him to sleep.

27:27.740 --> 27:29.876
Whew...

27:34.080 --> 27:37.981
Oh, come here, come here.

27:37.983 --> 27:39.886
Oh...

27:41.121 --> 27:43.555
Let's wrap him up.

27:43.557 --> 27:46.360
Let's wrap him up.

27:48.994 --> 27:52.463
Okay. Just like that.

27:52.465 --> 27:54.865
Let's put him in his crib, yeah?

27:54.867 --> 27:56.668
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:56.670 --> 27:58.569
I got him.

27:58.571 --> 27:58.905
Alright.

27:59.806 --> 28:00.838
Come on, handsome.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.809
Alright. Yeah.

28:21.928 --> 28:23.931
My son...

28:30.002 --> 28:31.838
Ah...

28:44.483 --> 28:46.151
You're gonna... hear and...

28:46.153 --> 28:49.888
see a lot about me in my life.

28:49.890 --> 28:51.726
Fuck!

29:32.097 --> 29:34.969
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:37.503 --> 29:41.038
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, guys. Guys!

29:41.040 --> 29:43.443
Molokai! Murray!

29:44.044 --> 29:46.680
Guys, I got something.

29:48.147 --> 29:50.016
What is it?

29:50.983 --> 29:53.084
That's Bill Williamson.

29:53.086 --> 29:54.952
Who?

29:54.954 --> 29:55.953
Bill Williamson.

29:55.955 --> 29:56.889
Fucking...

29:56.891 --> 29:58.489
Biggest mass murderer
in American history.

29:58.491 --> 30:00.091
I thought he was dead.

30:00.093 --> 30:01.961
So did everyone.

30:02.929 --> 30:04.696
What time is that at?

30:04.698 --> 30:07.532
This is like an hour
before the shooting.

30:07.534 --> 30:09.500
Jesus Christ.

30:09.502 --> 30:11.001
We now have our suspect.

30:11.003 --> 30:12.202
The fucking beard on him.

30:12.204 --> 30:13.103
He's alive?

30:13.105 --> 30:15.239
That doesn't make any sense.

30:15.241 --> 30:19.043
Yeah, well, guess what,
it's making sense.

30:19.045 --> 30:20.210
I just got him. It's him.

30:20.212 --> 30:21.746
It had to be him. Right?

30:21.748 --> 30:24.582
He's in D.C. the same time
the President is shot.

30:24.584 --> 30:26.049
Haven't you seen
those YouTube videos

30:26.051 --> 30:27.151
and everything he's done?

30:33.993 --> 30:35.294
Look. Listen to this.

30:35.296 --> 30:38.930
I <i>want you to change the world</i>
<i>and I and don't think</i>

30:38.932 --> 30:41.132
<i>that this is gonna happen
peacefully</i>

30:41.134 --> 30:42.333
<i>or you can do it alone.</i>

30:42.335 --> 30:45.737
<i>We need to kill the rich!
You get out there.</i>

30:45.739 --> 30:48.273
<i>You use your weapons.
You rip Washington apart.</i>

30:48.275 --> 30:52.142
<i>You hunt down the billionaires,
the bank bosses, the CEOs,</i>

30:52.144 --> 30:53.745
<i>the scumbags and the liars,</i>

30:53.747 --> 30:56.080
<i>the governors,
the lobbyists, the senators,</i>

30:56.082 --> 30:57.748
<i>because they're all the same!</i>

30:57.750 --> 30:58.850
<i>You... you hang them...</i>

30:58.852 --> 31:01.318
<i>from the first tree
that you can find.</i>

31:01.320 --> 31:03.688
<i>We need to do this together!!</i>

31:03.690 --> 31:06.958
<i>Okay! So I thank you,
in advance,</i>

31:06.960 --> 31:08.863
<i>for your help!</i>

31:11.698 --> 31:13.698
Get me the Deputy Director
on the phone.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.199
Sir, we have video confirmation

31:15.201 --> 31:17.267
that Bill Williamson's
still alive.

31:17.269 --> 31:20.203
<i>Bill</i> Williamson? <i>The</i>
<i>Tenderville Terrorist? Where?</i>

31:20.205 --> 31:22.574
He was right here in D.C.

31:22.576 --> 31:23.908
the day the President
was shot.

31:23.910 --> 31:26.076
Facial-recognition program
confirms it.

31:26.078 --> 31:28.112
Alright. <i>I want you to call</i>
<i>in all your support teams.</i>

31:28.114 --> 31:30.047
<i>Get everybody
on this right away.</i>

31:30.049 --> 31:31.048
- Absolutely.

31:31.050 --> 31:32.217
We <i>need to be 100% sure</i>

31:32.219 --> 31:33.418
<i>about this before
we ring any alarm bells.</i>

31:33.420 --> 31:36.921
<i>Especially right now.
The nation's panicked as it is.</i>

31:36.923 --> 31:38.021
Yes, sir.

31:38.023 --> 31:40.091
<i>Find</i> him. <i>But keep a low
profile.</i>

31:40.093 --> 31:41.258
<i>No hints to the press.</i>

31:41.260 --> 31:43.594
Alright. Thank you, sir.

31:43.596 --> 31:46.597
Okay... let's follow this lead.

31:46.599 --> 31:48.601
Alright.

32:06.952 --> 32:09.653
Bill Williamson was born
in the small town

32:09.655 --> 32:11.889
of Tenderville, Oregon,
December 25, 1986,

32:11.891 --> 32:15.793
to Allan and Sarah Williamson.
Both deceased.

32:15.795 --> 32:18.395
His mom was a social worker,
dad was in the accounting firm.

32:18.397 --> 32:22.132
<i>Lived a pretty normal life.
He was a mechanic. Then...</i>

32:22.134 --> 32:25.737
May 14, 2009, a few months
after his 23rd birthday,

32:25.739 --> 32:28.373
<i>he loaded up a van
with explosives,</i>

32:28.375 --> 32:29.974
<i>blew up police headquarters,</i>

32:29.976 --> 32:31.375
then he went on a killing spree.

32:31.377 --> 32:33.777
<i>He executed 93 people
that morning</i>

32:33.779 --> 32:34.578
Jesus <i>Christ.</i>

32:34.580 --> 32:36.713
<i>Made</i> off into the woods,

32:36.715 --> 32:38.982
where he shot and killed
his best friend, Evan Drince.

32:38.984 --> 32:41.853
<i>Dressed him up in the suit
of armor, tried to frame him.</i>

32:41.855 --> 32:43.955
<i>He staged it
to look like a suicide.</i>

32:43.957 --> 32:46.423
In 2014,
he resurfaced in Washington,

32:46.425 --> 32:49.861
where he blew up his car

32:49.863 --> 32:51.261
<i>outside the television station</i>

32:51.263 --> 32:52.330
before entering and murdering

32:52.332 --> 32:54.265
<i>a security guard
and several employees.</i>

32:54.267 --> 32:56.801
<i>He took the remaining
survivors hostage.</i>

32:56.803 --> 32:59.136
<i>Demanded a video
be played nationwide.</i>

32:59.138 --> 33:02.407
He also wanted a camera crew
there for a live interview.

33:02.409 --> 33:03.975
Of course, we all know
how that ended.

33:03.977 --> 33:06.744
Shortly after that,
his father committed suicide,

33:06.746 --> 33:08.979
because he couldn't handle
knowing

33:08.981 --> 33:12.150
that he, uh, give birth to that.

33:12.152 --> 33:13.884
Now, what we need to do
is trace back

33:13.886 --> 33:15.687
the video footage
from that point,

33:15.689 --> 33:17.889
second by second,
see where he was that day.

33:17.891 --> 33:20.091
Need to see how he got in,
how he got out.

33:20.093 --> 33:22.259
Most importantly,
where he went afterwards.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.764
Molokai.

33:27.232 --> 33:29.769
Jones.

33:32.172 --> 33:34.706
Nice to meet you.

33:34.708 --> 33:38.045
Nice... to... meet... you.

33:51.191 --> 33:54.057
<i>The people
that are representing you</i>

33:54.059 --> 33:55.759
<i>are bought and paid for
to keep you stupid,</i>

33:55.761 --> 34:00.398
<i>in your small...
stupid... little world.</i>

34:00.400 --> 34:04.168
How can there be no gun control,

34:04.170 --> 34:05.403
<i>even though there are
monthly massacres?</i>

34:05.405 --> 34:10.373
<i>In the USA, 11,000 people
are shot every year.</i>

34:10.376 --> 34:13.411
<i>In the UK, it's only 300. Why?</i>

34:13.413 --> 34:15.916
<i>Because the UK...</i>

34:16.483 --> 34:18.315
<i>...doesn't have guns.</i>

34:18.318 --> 34:21.518
<i>People don't have guns. Period.</i>

34:21.521 --> 34:24.956
What I have done in the past
and what I'm doing right now

34:24.958 --> 34:27.157
<i>is the result
of no gun control.</i>

34:27.159 --> 34:29.994
<i>There aren't even background
checks to filter out...</i>

34:29.996 --> 34:33.231
I swear to God, if they
just gave all these teachers...

34:33.233 --> 34:36.434
hired some security guards,
I mean it's providing jobs

34:36.436 --> 34:38.503
for people...
They give them the guns,

34:38.505 --> 34:42.206
I guarantee you
all this stuff would go away.

34:42.208 --> 34:44.141
You fucking kidding me?
They'd be killing each other...

34:44.143 --> 34:47.244
They wouldn't. They'd be
trained. Professionals!

34:47.246 --> 34:49.315
That are just... so happen
to be also teachers. But...

34:51.885 --> 34:53.087
At least there would be a little
bit of fear within there.

34:54.253 --> 34:55.387
Now the kids go
to fucking school,

34:55.389 --> 34:57.255
and they're fucking scared
every day of getting shot.

34:57.257 --> 35:00.258
In my experience,
you can't control human nature.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.193
People are going
to do irrational things

35:02.195 --> 35:03.461
at irrational times.

35:03.463 --> 35:04.829
So that makes it okay?

35:04.831 --> 35:07.264
It doesn't make it okay.
It's just a fact.

35:07.266 --> 35:09.166
It's how we're built.

35:09.168 --> 35:12.869
...The <i>U.S.A. has 5%</i>
<i>of the world's population</i>

35:12.871 --> 35:14.838
<i>and 25%
of the world's prisoners.</i>

35:14.840 --> 35:17.074
<i>People go to jail because
they have</i>

35:17.076 --> 35:19.409
<i>10 grams of cocaine
in their pockets.</i>

35:19.411 --> 35:22.079
<i>Half of the prisoners are
in jail for drug possession,</i>

35:22.081 --> 35:25.016
<i>and more than half are black.</i>

35:25.018 --> 35:27.885
<i>Why does this absurd
situation not get changed?</i>

35:27.887 --> 35:30.021
Because they do the crime!

35:30.023 --> 35:31.255
...Washington <i>gets paid</i>

35:31.257 --> 35:34.057
<i>to keep it going
by the prison-industry lobby.</i>

35:34.059 --> 35:36.026
<i>Why don't the rich pop stars
and film stars...</i>

35:36.028 --> 35:40.865
Have you fucking been
to Detroit? Do you even know?

35:40.867 --> 35:43.166
It's... a black problem, man.

35:43.168 --> 35:45.336
Like, you can't just
sit there and be, like:

35:45.338 --> 35:47.604
"Oh, no, it's not their fault."
It is, in some respects!

35:47.606 --> 35:49.941
It's not always,
but you can't say

35:49.943 --> 35:52.443
the fucking black guys
that are in jail

35:52.445 --> 35:54.882
aren't there for a reason.

35:55.581 --> 35:57.481
Am I racist?

35:57.483 --> 35:59.050
Somewhat.

35:59.052 --> 36:00.517
It's not fucking racist.
It's just the truth.

36:00.519 --> 36:02.220
Look at all this
police brutality.

36:02.222 --> 36:04.521
How's that justify it? You see
it on the Internet every day.

36:04.523 --> 36:07.258
Because everyone's fucking
scared. Everyone's scared...

36:07.260 --> 36:09.260
Just 'cause you're scared
of someone

36:09.262 --> 36:10.427
doesn't give you
the fucking right

36:10.429 --> 36:12.863
to gun somebody down unarmed
in cold blood,

36:12.865 --> 36:14.197
shooting them in
the back.

36:14.199 --> 36:15.465
I agree.

36:15.467 --> 36:16.434
It's no different,
what he does.

36:16.436 --> 36:18.568
- It's very different.
- He kills innocent people.

36:18.570 --> 36:19.302
He walks
down the street with...

36:19.304 --> 36:21.072
So are the police!

36:21.074 --> 36:22.874
I'm sorry,
what country are you from?

36:22.876 --> 36:25.409
Do I agree with everything
he's doing? No.

36:25.411 --> 36:26.943
But his basic message,

36:26.945 --> 36:28.144
<i>I can find some truth in that.</i>

36:28.146 --> 36:31.449
His <i>basic message</i>
<i>is not what he's actually</i>

36:31.451 --> 36:32.950
<i>physically doing!</i>

36:32.952 --> 36:34.117
<i>He's out there
killing innocent people!</i>

36:34.119 --> 36:38.655
- He's <i>a psychopath.</i>
- He's <i>killing innocent people!</i>

36:38.657 --> 36:39.590
Think our government's
any different?

36:39.592 --> 36:42.492
Just cause we do it over
in the Middle East,

36:42.494 --> 36:44.130
that makes it okay?

36:45.264 --> 36:47.530
Look.

36:47.532 --> 36:50.668
What we do over in the Middle
East is for the right reasons,

36:50.670 --> 36:53.137
whether you want
to believe it or not.

36:53.139 --> 36:56.340
Those guys would be bombing
the fuck out of us

36:56.342 --> 36:58.943
if we weren't
over there right now.

36:58.945 --> 37:01.244
And if you really wanted to know
what I think...

37:01.246 --> 37:03.146
we should fucking
make the whole place

37:03.148 --> 37:05.349
a parking lot
and start all over again.

37:05.351 --> 37:08.385
Can you imagine
if they had all that power?

37:08.387 --> 37:12.088
Can you imagine?
Put yourself in that situation.

37:12.090 --> 37:14.358
All of sudden
they have all the money,

37:14.360 --> 37:16.026
all the weapons and power.
What are we gonna be doing?

37:16.028 --> 37:18.262
<i>We'd be shaking
in our fucking goddamn shoes.</i>

37:18.264 --> 37:20.130
Every <i>war's been a crime.</i>

37:20.132 --> 37:23.066
<i>For war profiteering.
That's the only purpose of it.</i>

37:23.068 --> 37:24.969
Yeah, <i>well, you know what?</i>

37:24.971 --> 37:27.271
Call me wrong, but I've been
on the winning side

37:27.273 --> 37:28.171
of most of them,
and I wanna stay that way.

37:28.173 --> 37:30.974
Without the Iraq War
there'd be no ISIS,

37:30.976 --> 37:34.313
so you can blame Bush
for that one.

37:35.447 --> 37:36.246
Let's not go there.

37:36.248 --> 37:37.615
Following in his daddy's
footsteps.

37:37.617 --> 37:40.517
Okay, let's not go there.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.052
Created the war on terrorism.

37:42.054 --> 37:43.088
Let's not go there.

37:43.090 --> 37:45.289
War on terrorism is actually
a war on our freedom.

37:45.291 --> 37:47.157
No I... I can't listen
to this shit anymore!

37:47.159 --> 37:48.459
Who the fuck do you think's
running this country?

37:48.461 --> 37:52.362
<i>It sure as fuck ain't
the President! Not anymore!</i>

37:52.364 --> 37:54.731
How <i>many fucking people</i>
<i>do you think</i>

37:54.733 --> 37:56.300
<i>our government have killed?</i>

37:56.302 --> 37:58.135
I <i>don't care! That's our side!</i>

37:58.137 --> 38:01.572
This is our home! How'd...

38:01.574 --> 38:02.673
how do you guys think that way?!

38:02.675 --> 38:05.075
<i>We're fucking protecting
these people!</i>

38:05.077 --> 38:08.112
My <i>point is it doesn't matter</i>
<i>if we catch him or not.</i>

38:08.114 --> 38:09.512
<i>There will always be
another Bill Williamson</i>

38:09.514 --> 38:11.449
<i>or another terrorist group
like ISIS.</i>

38:11.451 --> 38:15.219
Our freedom is already gone.
We've already been robbed of it.

38:15.221 --> 38:17.153
We just don't know it yet.

38:17.155 --> 38:21.726
Yeah, well,
ISIS didn't do this.

38:21.728 --> 38:24.128
<i>Bill Williamson did.</i>

38:24.130 --> 38:27.200
So let's go kill
the fucking idiot.

38:35.641 --> 38:37.474
He knows what he's doing.

38:37.476 --> 38:39.309
If you're the most wanted man
in America,

38:39.311 --> 38:41.644
why the fuck would you
walk by a camera like that?

38:41.646 --> 38:43.447
It doesn't make any sense.

38:43.449 --> 38:45.749
Where does he sleep?

38:45.751 --> 38:48.651
We checked every hotel, motel.

38:48.653 --> 38:51.322
Hostel. Airbnb.

38:51.324 --> 38:55.025
Checked everything.
Trail just went cold.

38:55.027 --> 38:57.695
He's got the means, guys.

38:57.697 --> 39:00.097
He's got the money.

39:00.099 --> 39:02.700
If he's been gone this long...

39:02.702 --> 39:05.735
he's been hiding the whole time.

39:05.737 --> 39:08.507
He's getting ready for us.

39:09.742 --> 39:12.412
He wants us to follow him.

39:15.181 --> 39:17.347
You think he's baiting us?

39:17.349 --> 39:20.119
For sure he is.
It's a trap.

39:22.054 --> 39:23.521
He knows we're coming after him.

39:45.411 --> 39:46.209
Agent Molokai!

39:46.211 --> 39:48.215
You're leading
this investigation.

39:48.815 --> 39:50.146
So what's going on?

39:50.148 --> 39:51.615
No comment.

39:51.617 --> 39:52.682
Do you have any suspects?

39:52.684 --> 39:55.586
Come on! We're in the dark here.
The American people

39:55.588 --> 39:58.222
deserve to know.
Do you have any leads?

39:58.224 --> 40:03.094
Any news at all?!
Just a statement? Come on!

40:03.096 --> 40:06.229
Your silence is very unnerving.

40:06.231 --> 40:09.599
Agent! Agent Molokai, come on!

40:09.601 --> 40:12.239
You gotta tell us something!

40:19.311 --> 40:20.845
That was Agent Molokai,

40:20.847 --> 40:25.585
leading the investigation of the
death of our political leaders.

40:26.452 --> 40:29.056
Silence.

40:30.856 --> 40:32.590
Here.

40:32.592 --> 40:36.159
Heater's over here.

40:36.161 --> 40:38.528
Yeah.

40:38.530 --> 40:40.731
Keep him warm.

40:40.733 --> 40:42.733
Is that, uh, cot okay?

40:42.735 --> 40:44.604
- He's okay.

40:55.581 --> 40:57.615
You hungry?

40:57.617 --> 40:59.816
Mm... no. I'll take a drink.

40:59.818 --> 41:01.584
Sardines?

41:01.586 --> 41:04.155
No, I don't want any sardines.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.625
Sardines, corned beef...

41:12.597 --> 41:13.930
You alright?

41:13.932 --> 41:15.633
Mm-hmm.

41:15.635 --> 41:17.403
Here.

41:59.579 --> 42:01.945
What's going on?! I was
just working on something!!

42:01.947 --> 42:03.546
The fuck is this?!

42:03.548 --> 42:07.387
Get the utility company
on the phone now!

42:10.956 --> 42:13.393
Everything's crashed.

42:14.559 --> 42:16.293
Murray!!

42:16.295 --> 42:18.996
It could've been
an electromagnetic pulse, okay?

42:18.998 --> 42:20.764
And someone would've
had to do that...

42:20.766 --> 42:21.831
Deliberately.

42:21.833 --> 42:22.967
Targeted our network.

42:22.969 --> 42:24.668
How do we find out
if you can do that?

42:24.670 --> 42:26.472
Call someone to get
someone in here for it.

42:26.938 --> 42:27.804
Cellphones working?

42:27.806 --> 42:30.276
I'll go back down
to the breaker room.

42:30.675 --> 42:31.742
Look it...

42:31.744 --> 42:32.842
I got nothing.

42:32.844 --> 42:34.945
I've lost fucking everything!!

42:34.947 --> 42:35.880
If someone sent an
electromagnetic pulse,

42:35.882 --> 42:37.981
chances are it could've
burned everything.

42:37.983 --> 42:39.483
Everything's wiped!

42:39.485 --> 42:42.552
Is everything gone?

42:42.554 --> 42:45.289
Look, somebody
did this on purpose, okay?

42:45.291 --> 42:47.657
Th-this wasn't an accident.

42:47.659 --> 42:48.891
Just stop talking,

42:48.893 --> 42:52.528
and whatever we need
to do, get on it.

42:52.530 --> 42:55.331
We're wasting fucking time.

42:55.333 --> 42:58.269
Tell me the most logical
next step.

42:58.271 --> 43:00.804
There's not
a lot of options here, okay?

43:00.806 --> 43:02.606
But... what we can do is...

43:02.608 --> 43:04.641
we can reboot the whole program

43:04.643 --> 43:08.479
and... and start
the facial recognition again.

43:08.481 --> 43:09.912
Fucking kidding me?! Fuck!!

43:09.914 --> 43:12.619
That's the best I can do.

43:14.753 --> 43:16.452
Okay.

43:16.454 --> 43:17.487
How could you let this happen?

43:17.489 --> 43:18.889
I thought you were some sort
of fucking whiz kid!!

43:18.891 --> 43:19.889
Alright, let him alone.

43:19.891 --> 43:21.325
I'm not God, okay?!

43:21.327 --> 43:24.360
Leave him alone.
It fucking wasn't him.

43:24.362 --> 43:25.762
We better get back at it!
We gotta start

43:25.764 --> 43:27.733
all over again!
Fuck!

43:31.369 --> 43:34.371
You know
what I was thinking about?

43:34.373 --> 43:37.644
How much you're gonna miss me
when I'm gone.

43:41.981 --> 43:43.579
You're not?

43:43.581 --> 43:44.914
Didn't I tell you
there's already a...

43:44.916 --> 43:46.349
What? Another guy?

43:46.351 --> 43:47.450
...a man on a horse

43:47.452 --> 43:48.418
waiting to come get me?

43:48.420 --> 43:50.787
A man on a horse?
What, is he from the 1800s?

43:50.789 --> 43:52.555
He's from the 1800s.

43:52.557 --> 43:56.526
Yeah? Does he also joust?

43:56.528 --> 43:58.494
He's gonna joust his way

43:58.496 --> 43:59.829
through that forest,
pick me up.

43:59.831 --> 44:01.932
His white stallion

44:01.934 --> 44:03.400
- in the forest.
- Mm-hmm.

44:03.402 --> 44:05.936
Well, I hope he steps

44:05.938 --> 44:07.670
on one of my landmines.

44:11.077 --> 44:12.842
I met him, uh...

44:12.844 --> 44:14.677
Javelin thrower.

44:14.679 --> 44:16.880
I met him on
one of those dating sites.

44:16.882 --> 44:17.981
It was...

44:17.983 --> 44:19.349
- Oh, yeah?
- ...really awkward.

44:19.351 --> 44:20.383
You love the Internet.

44:21.286 --> 44:23.522
You meet all your boys
on the Internet.

44:24.356 --> 44:26.023
Live in the moment.

44:34.567 --> 44:36.467
You're not serious, are you?

44:36.469 --> 44:37.967
No, I'm not serious.

44:37.969 --> 44:38.601
Alright.

44:38.603 --> 44:39.670
I wish I found a jousting...

44:39.672 --> 44:43.576
Eventually, you're gonna have
to move on, though.

44:47.679 --> 44:49.481
Don't say that.

44:56.521 --> 44:59.391
I don't want to leave you.

45:02.994 --> 45:04.797
Do you hear me?

45:07.166 --> 45:11.001
I don't have to leave you,
you know. I don't.

45:11.003 --> 45:13.871
We could just keep hiding.
We could just keep running.

45:13.873 --> 45:16.706
No. I can't hide.
I'm not hiding. I'm not hiding.

45:16.708 --> 45:19.909
That's the whole point.
I'm not hiding anymore.

45:22.715 --> 45:25.916
That's the whole point of
everything that I've been doing.

45:25.918 --> 45:29.119
It's for this... for
this moment. This is it.

45:29.121 --> 45:33.791
We talked about this
so many times.

45:33.793 --> 45:38.431
You're gonna stick to the plan.
The one that we discussed.

45:44.637 --> 45:46.836
You're gonna take Billy

45:46.838 --> 45:48.805
and you're gonna go
to your mom's house.

45:54.813 --> 45:55.912
Good night, guys.

45:55.914 --> 45:57.581
Good night.

45:57.583 --> 45:59.418
- Have a good one.
- Take care, man.

46:01.219 --> 46:03.519
We getting outta here?

46:03.521 --> 46:04.790
Yeah. You done?

46:05.824 --> 46:07.191
Yeah. Alright.

46:07.193 --> 46:09.159
See ya tomorrow.

46:09.161 --> 46:11.061
Don't work too hard, eh?

46:11.063 --> 46:12.999
Yeah.

46:29.648 --> 46:31.715
What the hell is that?

46:31.717 --> 46:33.686
Get your ass over here.

46:34.253 --> 46:36.689
What you got there?

46:37.623 --> 46:40.757
A little fire. Cheers.

46:40.759 --> 46:42.561
Cheers.

46:45.664 --> 46:48.499
Keeps me off my edge.

46:48.501 --> 46:49.800
Ooh. It's good.

46:49.802 --> 46:53.170
Sometimes it's the only way
I can think straight.

46:53.172 --> 46:55.204
I don't mean to be a hard-ass.

46:55.206 --> 46:57.874
It's, you know, just, uh...

46:57.876 --> 46:59.610
got a lot of pressure.

46:59.612 --> 47:01.644
This whole fucking unit's
in my hands,

47:01.646 --> 47:03.782
this whole investigation's
sliding to shit

47:04.983 --> 47:06.916
for the longest time.
Then we get a lead

47:06.918 --> 47:09.686
and they fucking wipe our feet
out from right under us.

47:09.688 --> 47:13.724
Look, don't. Don't. You don't
need to apologize, man.

47:13.726 --> 47:18.095
You don't apologize
for anything. I get it.

47:18.097 --> 47:21.231
Molly's bugging me about going
to her little recital tomorrow.

47:21.233 --> 47:23.700
"Sorry, Molly. Can't go.

47:23.702 --> 47:27.104
Gotta go catch terrorists."

47:27.106 --> 47:31.945
So, uh... why don't you wear
your wedding ring, man?

47:32.545 --> 47:35.144
To work?

47:35.146 --> 47:39.749
Well, you're not around me
all the time, but...

47:39.751 --> 47:42.755
I'm with you
more than your family is.

47:44.989 --> 47:47.826
I dunno. I just...

47:52.264 --> 47:55.635
Sometimes I feel like if I...

47:56.302 --> 47:59.302
...wear it, I'm...

47:59.304 --> 48:04.041
...bringing 'em into this...
I dunno, this mess.

48:04.043 --> 48:07.744
And I just don't think they need
to know about any of this shit.

48:07.746 --> 48:09.845
I don't tell them a thing.

48:09.847 --> 48:12.648
Hmm.

48:12.650 --> 48:14.784
You're asking me
about my wedding ring?

48:14.786 --> 48:16.320
Why are you wearing yours?

48:16.322 --> 48:19.188
I wear it 'cause it reminds me

48:19.190 --> 48:20.423
<i>of something I once had.</i>

48:20.425 --> 48:25.061
<i>Keeps me grounded.
Reminds me that, you know...</i>

48:25.063 --> 48:28.331
...no matter how shitty
things get in this world,

48:28.333 --> 48:32.538
<i>there's always a time in your
life where you're happy.</i>

48:33.706 --> 48:36.809
<i>It's like I still have her
with me sometimes.</i>

48:38.077 --> 48:39.809
I know it sounds probably
fucked up to you, but...

48:39.811 --> 48:41.547
- No.
- ...this job

48:42.748 --> 48:44.146
destroyed my marriage.

48:44.148 --> 48:45.115
I was never there.

48:45.117 --> 48:47.883
<i>She wanted... you know,</i>

48:47.885 --> 48:50.820
<i>she wanted things
I couldn't give her and...</i>

48:50.822 --> 48:53.690
You <i>should probably take
the puppy off here</i>

48:53.692 --> 48:55.659
<i>pretty soon, though.
Not to be insensitive</i>

48:55.661 --> 48:58.565
<i>or anything like that.
I get it, but...</i>

48:59.632 --> 49:01.030
...people talk.

49:01.032 --> 49:01.965
I'll make you a deal.

49:01.967 --> 49:03.766
I'll take the ring off
as soon as you shave

49:03.768 --> 49:06.168
that greasy poon 'stache
off your face.

49:06.170 --> 49:07.670
Fuck that.

49:07.672 --> 49:09.773
<i>Had this thing
since I was 18, man.</i>

49:09.775 --> 49:12.912
<i>I'm serious. Been Tom
Sellecking it for a while.</i>

49:15.713 --> 49:18.949
Well, I gotta drive. So...

49:18.951 --> 49:22.318
...I gotta get going now.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.856
Alrighty. Get some rest.

49:25.690 --> 49:27.990
Yeah, I just... I can't...

49:27.992 --> 49:30.730
I can't stop thinking
about the fact that maybe...

49:33.331 --> 49:35.865
...maybe we get him.

49:35.867 --> 49:40.606
You know? Fuck.
Oh, well.

49:43.175 --> 49:45.878
The <i>CIA and Homeland Security</i>

49:46.878 --> 49:48.244
<i>have finally come
to the conclusion</i>

49:48.246 --> 49:53.849
<i>that it was ISIS terrorists
planted as Syrian refugees</i>

49:53.851 --> 49:57.887
who are responsible for the
deaths of our political leaders.

49:57.889 --> 50:02.425
The arrested subjects
have not been identified.

50:02.427 --> 50:03.461
The <i>killers of the President</i>

50:03.463 --> 50:04.662
<i>have been found
and are in custody.</i>

50:04.664 --> 50:07.164
<i>They entered the country
as a refugee family</i>

50:07.166 --> 50:09.999
<i>and were ultimately turned
in by their sponsor family,</i>

50:10.001 --> 50:11.068
<i>who grew suspicious
of their secretive behavior.</i>

50:11.070 --> 50:13.036
<i>Hey, guys.
Come here, quick.</i>

50:13.038 --> 50:14.271
The
<i>sponsors were shocked to find</i>

50:14.273 --> 50:17.007
<i>weapons, maps and photos
of the Senate building</i>

50:17.009 --> 50:18.711
<i>stashed in their
guesthouse attic.</i>

50:20.311 --> 50:21.677
Can you believe this shit?

50:21.679 --> 50:23.380
They <i>immediately contacted the
DCPD, who searched the guest...</i>

50:23.382 --> 50:24.947
ISIS!

50:24.949 --> 50:26.349
What?

50:26.351 --> 50:27.450
That doesn't make any sense.

50:27.452 --> 50:29.351
There's no physical evidence
proving they did this.

50:29.353 --> 50:31.822
Fucking kidding me?
They're taking fucking credit

50:31.824 --> 50:33.023
for everything!

50:33.025 --> 50:34.157
<i>Further</i>
attempts to contact

50:34.159 --> 50:36.992
<i>the host family
have been unsuccessful,</i>

50:36.994 --> 50:40.329
<i>and their whereabouts
are unknown.</i>

50:40.331 --> 50:43.201
ISIS, yeah.

50:50.175 --> 50:52.979
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, understood.

50:55.114 --> 50:58.048
We're done.
They're gonna dissolve this unit

50:58.050 --> 50:59.516
the first chance they get.

50:59.518 --> 51:00.816
This isn't done!

51:00.818 --> 51:02.952
Tell me about it.

51:02.954 --> 51:07.090
I'll see you soon.

51:07.092 --> 51:10.494
We need to show what we have!
To them! This is ridiculous!

51:10.496 --> 51:13.329
Not let these guys take
advantage of all this shit!

51:13.331 --> 51:15.264
I've already sent in
the intelligence report.

51:15.266 --> 51:17.200
They're fully aware
of everything that we found.

51:17.202 --> 51:19.469
Who is saying no to you?!

51:19.471 --> 51:20.970
Deputy Director.

51:20.972 --> 51:26.976
Is it ISIS? Is it ISIS?!
Did ISIS do it?!

51:26.978 --> 51:30.813
Or is it little Bill Williamson
from a mountaintop?

51:30.815 --> 51:33.516
You tried to catch me before.

51:33.518 --> 51:36.021
What's gonna change now?

51:37.322 --> 51:40.023
Nothing.

51:40.025 --> 51:43.459
You're wrapped around
my little finger.

51:43.461 --> 51:46.264
I can do whatever I want.

51:46.998 --> 51:49.234
That's been proven.

52:02.380 --> 52:04.146
<i>We</i> have
received a statement

52:04.148 --> 52:07.050
<i>from the Office
of the President as follows:</i>

52:07.052 --> 52:10.287
"Today, the United States
of America deployed

52:10.289 --> 52:13.590
<i>"22 nuclear warheads
and 38 neutron bombs</i>

52:13.592 --> 52:15.958
<i>to destroy our enemies
in Pakistan,</i>

52:15.960 --> 52:17.927
"Indonesia and the Middle East.

52:17.929 --> 52:19.898
"Russia and China
supported the action.

52:20.865 --> 52:21.965
"The resources
of the Middle East

52:21.967 --> 52:23.934
<i>will be split evenly
between the U.S.,</i>

52:23.936 --> 52:26.503
<i>Russia, China
and Western Europe."</i>

52:26.505 --> 52:29.039
"We chose to react to the
<i>ongoing chaos and terror</i>

52:29.041 --> 52:30.574
<i>attacks and made the decision</i>

52:30.576 --> 52:33.880
<i>to stop radical Islam
once and for all."</i>

52:34.445 --> 52:35.912
"Effective immediately,

52:35.914 --> 52:38.014
Homeland Security
is closing all mosques,

52:38.016 --> 52:41.320
and the military is rounding up
the Muslim community."

52:53.197 --> 52:58.601
America was built by scum and
it's still being run by scum.

52:58.603 --> 53:01.070
But! America is the biggest

53:01.072 --> 53:03.405
military superpower
in the world.

53:03.407 --> 53:06.242
The most hi-tech,
with geniuses in Silicon Valley

53:06.244 --> 53:09.246
<i>making massive leaps
in computer technology.</i>

53:09.248 --> 53:12.081
<i>It's all in an effort
to neutralize</i>

53:12.083 --> 53:14.316
<i>and capture more poor people
and enslave them,</i>

53:14.318 --> 53:17.420
<i>and rape and pillage
their communities</i>

53:17.422 --> 53:19.456
<i>and their indigenous resources.</i>

53:19.458 --> 53:22.191
All of this is done
with the help of religion.

53:22.193 --> 53:25.394
The great divider. The great
controller. The hand of justice.

53:25.396 --> 53:26.929
Whether you're a Christian,

53:26.931 --> 53:28.130
Muslim, Jewish,
patriot, Scientologist,

53:28.132 --> 53:33.403
or follow any other ideology
some fuckhead can dream up,

53:33.405 --> 53:36.039
if you can't disseminate
what is right and wrong

53:36.041 --> 53:41.978
in context, in time and place,
you are a fucking idiot.

53:41.980 --> 53:44.014
<i>I won't say
there aren't ideologies</i>

53:44.016 --> 53:46.416
<i>in all religions
the make sense and are useful.</i>

53:46.418 --> 53:49.552
<i>Any asshole can confuse
philosophy, and they do.</i>

53:49.554 --> 53:53.125
Nietzsche was misunderstood
and connected to the Nazis.

53:53.992 --> 53:54.891
He also said a long time ago

53:54.893 --> 53:57.193
that on top
of the mountain of wisdom,

53:57.195 --> 54:00.130
it's very lonely and ice cold,

54:00.132 --> 54:03.599
and if you climb it,
there's no bigger gratification.

54:03.601 --> 54:07.537
All these actors and pop stars
are monkeys and puppets.

54:07.539 --> 54:09.271
They brainwash the people

54:09.273 --> 54:11.141
and keep them
from that mountaintop.

54:11.143 --> 54:13.008
All these comic-book movies
- Transformers,

54:13.010 --> 54:16.278
The Avengers, Lone Survivor,
American Sniper -

54:16.280 --> 54:19.382
they're propaganda,
they're perpetuated by Hollywood

54:19.384 --> 54:21.184
<i>that in the end
it just glorifies</i>

54:21.186 --> 54:23.052
<i>the military
and the weapon industry.</i>

54:23.054 --> 54:25.287
<i>They do it for the money!</i>

54:25.289 --> 54:28.557
<i>Jennifer Aniston, Jay-Z,
Tom Cruise, Michael Bay,</i>

54:28.559 --> 54:30.659
they live in mansions
on a hilltop

54:30.661 --> 54:32.228
and they have no recollection

54:32.230 --> 54:34.164
of what it's like
to be a human anymore.

54:34.166 --> 54:37.903
They're a hologram
that you worship!

54:40.972 --> 54:43.606
Huh.

54:43.608 --> 54:47.610
Williamsville, Virginia.
That's it, you guys. After that,

54:47.612 --> 54:50.282
he just kind of vanishes
into thin air.

54:51.048 --> 54:52.749
Completely off the grid.

54:52.751 --> 54:57.086
What's the next stop
or the next town up above it?

54:57.088 --> 54:59.421
Next train station
is Fredericksburg,

54:59.423 --> 55:02.291
110 miles from there.

55:02.293 --> 55:03.994
You didn't see him
after this, though?

55:03.996 --> 55:05.030
No. Well, according
to the video footage,

55:06.197 --> 55:07.065
that's the last spot
he got off the train.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.599
It's a small town.
There's not much there.

55:09.601 --> 55:10.733
Other than that train station,

55:10.735 --> 55:12.404
it's just trees and mountains.

55:13.338 --> 55:14.037
You know it?

55:14.039 --> 55:16.342
Yeah. I've been there before.

55:18.610 --> 55:20.744
<i>Should we go?</i>

55:20.746 --> 55:23.679
<i>Yeah. We might as well
go survey the area.</i>

55:23.681 --> 55:26.017
It's a good start.

55:46.737 --> 55:48.237
I want you to show
this to Billy

55:48.239 --> 55:51.376
when he's old enough
to understand it, okay?

55:54.780 --> 55:56.983
Take it.

56:02.788 --> 56:05.621
I don't want to leave you.

56:05.623 --> 56:07.525
Come here.

56:11.063 --> 56:12.829
You hear me?

56:12.831 --> 56:14.430
Why do we have to leave?
Why can we just...

56:14.432 --> 56:19.469
why can't we just...
keep running and hide?

56:19.471 --> 56:23.608
'Cause I can't hide. I can't
keep hiding. You know that.

56:24.476 --> 56:26.642
Why?

56:26.644 --> 56:29.181
You need to go, okay?

56:30.449 --> 56:34.284
You need to take Billy
and you need to go

56:34.286 --> 56:37.188
as far away from me as possible.

56:39.291 --> 56:42.791
Like we planned.
You need to do that for me

56:42.793 --> 56:44.529
and you need to do that
for Billy.

56:47.833 --> 56:51.070
What are you gonna do for him?

56:51.769 --> 56:52.338
He needs a father. He needs you.

56:55.306 --> 56:58.340
He doesn't need a fucking DVD!
He needs you!

56:58.342 --> 57:01.276
Don't you fucking
do this to me, okay?

57:01.278 --> 57:03.278
You need to go like we planned.

57:03.280 --> 57:08.119
Because they know where
I am and they're coming.

57:13.224 --> 57:15.592
And you're not safe here.

57:15.594 --> 57:19.496
So you walk out of that forest
and you never saw me.

57:19.498 --> 57:21.666
And you never fucking met me.

57:23.601 --> 57:25.869
You never met me.

57:25.871 --> 57:27.604
I wish I never met you.

57:27.606 --> 57:28.771
Hey, don't fucking say that.

57:28.773 --> 57:30.643
Don't fucking say that.

57:31.809 --> 57:32.876
Ah...

57:32.878 --> 57:34.543
Fuck.

57:34.545 --> 57:35.612
I love you.

57:35.614 --> 57:36.412
I love you.

57:36.414 --> 57:38.683
I love you guys
more than anything.

57:46.791 --> 57:48.160
But you have to go.

57:49.628 --> 57:53.295
You're gonna go see
your mom, right?

57:53.297 --> 57:56.534
You're gonna tell her
that you love her?

57:57.635 --> 58:00.235
- Yeah.
- Okay.

58:00.237 --> 58:03.773
Yeah. I'm just a...

58:03.775 --> 58:07.744
I am just a lonely mother
taking her son out

58:07.746 --> 58:10.179
for a hike for the first time.

58:10.181 --> 58:12.182
Right.

58:12.184 --> 58:13.016
I don't know where I am.

58:13.018 --> 58:15.418
And who the fuck
is Bill Williamson?

58:15.420 --> 58:18.921
Yeah. I'm looking
for a man on a horse.

58:20.592 --> 58:22.260
You seen one?

58:24.795 --> 58:26.929
Okay.

58:26.931 --> 58:29.667
You're gonna be alright. Okay?

58:30.735 --> 58:32.202
You're gonna be okay.

58:32.204 --> 58:33.503
Yeah.

58:33.505 --> 58:34.403
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

58:34.405 --> 58:37.143
You're both gonna be okay.

58:44.882 --> 58:46.684
Okay.

58:52.657 --> 58:54.557
Better go.

59:18.983 --> 59:23.322
Ah, fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

59:40.771 --> 59:42.607
Let's get this fucker.

59:45.976 --> 59:49.748
We're gonna go in there,
we're gonna take him down.

01:00:20.644 --> 01:00:23.412
Williamson's a real Boy Scout.

01:00:23.414 --> 01:00:24.514
If he's taken refuge out here,

01:00:24.516 --> 01:00:26.048
it's gonna be
like chasing a ghost.

01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:27.650
Yeah, no shit.

01:00:27.652 --> 01:00:30.086
Our only shot is to scan
the area with thermal imaging.

01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:31.387
Yeah, well, I'm calling NSA.

01:00:31.389 --> 01:00:32.755
We're gonna get
some drones in there.

01:00:32.757 --> 01:00:35.657
Do a little aerial sweep.
We'll find him.

01:00:35.659 --> 01:00:39.996
He's out there. He's watching
us right now. I can feel it.

01:00:39.998 --> 01:00:42.065
Yeah?

01:00:42.067 --> 01:00:44.666
Hey, Bill!!

01:00:44.668 --> 01:00:48.570
You wanna be a man
and come out?!

01:00:48.572 --> 01:00:52.411
We're right here, buddy!
You wanna play?!

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:55.480
Fucking wise-ass.

01:00:59.617 --> 01:01:02.554
Come <i>on. Let's go check
the bridge.</i>

01:01:10.394 --> 01:01:13.396
<i>Oh... the FBI. The FBI.</i>

01:01:13.398 --> 01:01:15.965
The Full-Blown Idiots.

01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:19.901
Ahem. We've been down
this road before, boys.

01:01:19.903 --> 01:01:23.375
So I know you guys are coming.

01:01:24.108 --> 01:01:26.575
Come.

01:01:26.577 --> 01:01:28.713
Bring all your boys.

01:01:29.847 --> 01:01:31.849
And I'll see ya soon.

01:01:36.019 --> 01:01:38.389
I'll see ya really soon.

01:02:29.507 --> 01:02:32.510
Holy... shit.

01:02:33.911 --> 01:02:36.045
ISIS, my fucking ass!!

01:02:36.047 --> 01:02:38.851
Boom!! Boys, get in here!

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:42.517
Boom.

01:02:42.519 --> 01:02:43.452
Sonofabitch. Is that him?

01:02:43.454 --> 01:02:45.054
That's him. I see it
in the way he's moving.

01:02:45.056 --> 01:02:46.188
Damn right's it is.

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:47.789
Get a lock
on those coordinates.

01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:50.193
Maps, grids. Everything
within a five-mile radius.

01:02:50.195 --> 01:02:52.094
Send these guys in soon.

01:02:52.096 --> 01:02:54.597
Let's get him.

01:02:54.599 --> 01:02:57.800
We need at least 300 bodies
searching those woods with us.

01:02:57.802 --> 01:02:59.936
SWAT, police, military.
Send us everyone you can.

01:02:59.938 --> 01:03:01.804
I <i>can't send you anyone now.</i>

01:03:01.806 --> 01:03:03.940
<i>You have
no hard evidence, Agent.</i>

01:03:03.942 --> 01:03:06.476
<i>You're supposed
to be dissolved by now!</i>

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:08.478
You can't drop us now.
We're way too close!

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.945
We <i>have confirmed</i>
<i>ISIS responsibility.</i>

01:03:09.947 --> 01:03:12.548
<i>It's in the media.
This will cause a shit storm</i>

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:14.550
<i>and we don't even know
he was involved.</i>

01:03:14.552 --> 01:03:16.519
I know that!
But we have satellite imaging

01:03:16.521 --> 01:03:17.820
confirming it's him.

01:03:17.822 --> 01:03:20.623
It's him! We have it.
It's a picture clear as day.

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:21.724
What more do you want?!

01:03:21.726 --> 01:03:23.693
Williamson's <i>alive.</i>
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

01:03:23.695 --> 01:03:26.162
<i>But you lost his trail
and now you're coming to me</i>

01:03:26.164 --> 01:03:27.796
<i>on a hunch
with some blurry video?</i>

01:03:27.798 --> 01:03:30.099
<i>That could be just some hunter!</i>

01:03:30.101 --> 01:03:31.900
No, you're wrong. It's him.

01:03:31.902 --> 01:03:32.635
A hundred percent!

01:03:32.637 --> 01:03:33.735
After <i>we dropped the nukes,</i>

01:03:33.737 --> 01:03:35.037
<i>we woke up
every terrorist sleeper cell</i>

01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:38.074
<i>hiding in our own backyard.
We have our hands full</i>

01:03:38.076 --> 01:03:40.008
<i>with terror threats
across the nation.</i>

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:42.577
<i>Without something more,
I have no resources to spare!</i>

01:03:42.579 --> 01:03:45.981
<i>You want him?
Go in with what you got!</i>

01:03:45.983 --> 01:03:47.717
What'd he say?

01:03:47.719 --> 01:03:49.987
We're on our own.

01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:14.480
Molokai...

01:04:15.179 --> 01:04:18.313
<i>What kind of name is that?</i>

01:04:18.315 --> 01:04:19.715
You know, you should listen

01:04:19.717 --> 01:04:22.617
to your colleagues
a little bit more.

01:04:22.619 --> 01:04:23.885
<i>Sometimes they
might actually know</i>

01:04:23.887 --> 01:04:26.655
<i>a little bit more than you.</i>

01:04:26.657 --> 01:04:29.659
You know, an asshole like you...

01:04:29.661 --> 01:04:33.295
there's a reason
why you still stay single.

01:04:33.297 --> 01:04:36.634
<i>ISIS?</i>

01:04:37.235 --> 01:04:39.068
<i>ISIS.</i>

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:40.769
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:44.706
That's pretty typical.
That's pretty typical nowadays.

01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:46.309
<i>You guys</i>

01:04:46.311 --> 01:04:48.010
<i>are kind of underestimating</i>

01:04:48.012 --> 01:04:51.313
your homegrown talent.

01:04:51.315 --> 01:04:53.751
Ah, one man could do it.

01:05:18.643 --> 01:05:20.711
<i>Molokai...</i>

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.550
<i>What kind of name is that?</i>

01:05:26.184 --> 01:05:27.650
<i>You know, you should listen</i>

01:05:27.652 --> 01:05:29.719

<i>a little bit more than you.</i>

01:05:32.389 --> 01:05:35.793
<i>So, guys, I'm here.
I'm waiting.</i>

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:38.894
<i>Seen this bridge before?</i>

01:05:38.896 --> 01:05:41.197
<i>Hmm?</i>

01:05:41.199 --> 01:05:43.032
<i>This river?</i>

01:05:43.034 --> 01:05:45.166
<i>You know the President
and what he represents</i>

01:05:45.168 --> 01:05:48.170
<i>when he's trying to set up
the new world order.</i>

01:05:48.172 --> 01:05:51.907
<i>And all you puppets
just fall in line.</i>

01:05:51.909 --> 01:05:52.974
<i>Well...</i>

01:05:52.976 --> 01:05:56.778
<i>maybe I'll make
my own new world order.</i>

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.115
<i>If he can do it, I can do it.</i>

01:06:00.117 --> 01:06:04.920
<i>You guys are just
little pawns in the game.</i>

01:06:04.922 --> 01:06:10.258
<i>He's not... doing anything
for you. Your President.</i>

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:13.065
<i>That's why he had to go.</i>

01:06:17.869 --> 01:06:19.834
Where did that just come from?

01:06:19.836 --> 01:06:20.903
I got it in my email.

01:06:20.905 --> 01:06:24.139
How the fuck
does he know who I am?

01:06:24.141 --> 01:06:28.043
You know what? When our power
went out, we must've got hacked.

01:06:28.045 --> 01:06:30.848
It's the only
logical explanation.

01:06:40.324 --> 01:06:44.630
You gotta be fucking kidding
me. He sent me one, too.

01:06:45.028 --> 01:06:47.128
Jones.

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:50.066
<i>How's your wife, Molly?</i>

01:06:50.068 --> 01:06:53.334
<i>Oh, your wife's name
is Sheila, isn't it? Sheila.</i>

01:06:53.336 --> 01:06:56.771
<i>Your daughter's name is Molly.</i>

01:06:56.773 --> 01:06:59.041
<i>Summer Heights High.</i>

01:06:59.043 --> 01:07:01.110
<i>No, that's a... Um, what is it?</i>

01:07:01.112 --> 01:07:03.244
<i>Arden Elementary.</i>

<i>That's pretty cute.</i>

01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:56.298
How can he fucking know
about our families?

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.970
Of course he fucking knows!

01:07:59.871 --> 01:08:03.238
Where the fuck's my phone?

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.175
This motherfucker
hacked our system!!

01:08:06.177 --> 01:08:09.748
He's gained full access
to the whole fucking database!

01:08:11.081 --> 01:08:13.249
He fucking knows everything now.

<i>That's pretty typical nowadays.</i>

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.107
back to the high ground.

01:13:05.109 --> 01:13:08.576
Comb every single
square inch of this.

01:13:08.578 --> 01:13:11.679
We're not leaving until
we get this fucker, alright?

01:13:11.681 --> 01:13:14.284
Let's move out!

01:13:40.711 --> 01:13:43.178
There's not
a trace of him anywhere.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.513
He's here.

01:13:44.515 --> 01:13:47.085
Gotta have eyes on us somewhere,
though.

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:52.286
Watch your 6!

01:13:52.288 --> 01:13:55.257
Nothing over here.

01:13:55.259 --> 01:13:58.427
There's an old
mining shaft up ahead.

01:13:58.429 --> 01:14:01.729
Well, the land survey
said it was up there.

01:14:01.731 --> 01:14:04.402
He's probably taken refuge
there, set up his home base.

01:14:19.449 --> 01:14:20.549
Over there!

01:14:20.551 --> 01:14:21.419
Covering fire!!

01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:25.821
Man down! Man down!

01:14:25.823 --> 01:14:27.889
Left!

01:14:27.891 --> 01:14:30.491
Get out! Get out!
Left, left!

01:14:30.493 --> 01:14:33.629
Covering fire!!
Covering fire!!

01:14:57.421 --> 01:15:00.789
He's using the high ground!
Everybody take cover!

01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:03.224
Guys, let's move it!!

01:15:03.226 --> 01:15:05.630
Cover!

01:15:26.417 --> 01:15:28.916
Reloading!

01:16:05.322 --> 01:16:08.458
You sonofabitch, Bill!!

01:16:11.494 --> 01:16:16.233
Get some medics out here now!!
The rest of you, move forward!

01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:27.342
We're moving forward!
We are not backing down!

01:16:27.344 --> 01:16:30.845
We are moving forward!
Do you hear that, Bill?!!

01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:33.482
There he is! Two o'clock!

01:16:33.484 --> 01:16:36.354
Let's go, guys!! Come on!!

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.035
Okay, you fucks.
Welcome to Camp Bill.

01:16:54.037 --> 01:16:58.442
Play safe, boys. No running.

01:16:59.342 --> 01:17:01.309
What did I tell you?

01:17:01.311 --> 01:17:02.643
Go, go!

01:17:02.645 --> 01:17:05.649
Wait, wait.
We're not done yet.

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:15.525
Bingo!

01:17:26.869 --> 01:17:29.403
Just don't learn your lesson!

01:17:46.989 --> 01:17:49.458
It's just too fucking easy.

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:53.597
Okay, where are you
Jones and Molokai?

01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:02.370
Pick up the pace!! There's
lives at stake here, people.

01:18:02.372 --> 01:18:03.972
Keep moving forward,
guys. Let's go!

01:18:03.974 --> 01:18:06.575
Keep moving!

01:18:06.577 --> 01:18:08.977
This whole thing's a setup.
We're walking

01:18:08.979 --> 01:18:11.146
into a goddamn
war zone out here.

01:18:11.148 --> 01:18:13.581
Jesus Christ.

01:18:13.583 --> 01:18:15.450
Look, can we send in dogs
or something,

01:18:15.452 --> 01:18:16.651
'cause I'm not doing this.

01:18:16.653 --> 01:18:19.553
Let's go. Stand back, guys.
Here, let's go. Move this way.

01:18:19.555 --> 01:18:21.858
Let's get outta here. Come on.

01:18:26.662 --> 01:18:30.734
Hey, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

01:18:32.002 --> 01:18:33.934
You hear that?

01:18:33.936 --> 01:18:39.007
There you are. I see you.
Look up here.

01:18:39.009 --> 01:18:40.741
Look up here.

01:18:40.743 --> 01:18:41.742
Look.

01:18:41.744 --> 01:18:45.615
That fucker's been watching
us the whole time.

01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:48.618
Little piece of shit.

01:18:49.153 --> 01:18:51.456
Yeah, not for long.

01:18:52.555 --> 01:18:54.889
Good shot, Jonesy.

01:18:54.891 --> 01:18:56.760
Good shot.

01:18:57.627 --> 01:18:59.463
My turn.

01:19:00.497 --> 01:19:03.031
- Huh. Fucker.

01:19:03.033 --> 01:19:05.370
Okay, you motherfuckers.

01:19:11.507 --> 01:19:13.909
Thanks for playing, boys.

01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:15.779
Game over.

01:19:41.537 --> 01:19:43.671
Where the fuck is he?!!

01:19:43.673 --> 01:19:44.238
Fuck!

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.610
Down! Down!

01:19:49.979 --> 01:19:51.815
Up there!

01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:56.420
Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:20:53.143 --> 01:20:55.078
There he is!

01:20:56.012 --> 01:20:57.914
Go, go, go!

01:22:33.409 --> 01:22:35.210
No!!

01:22:35.212 --> 01:22:38.015
No, no! No! No!

01:22:45.655 --> 01:22:48.926
Oh!

01:23:40.976 --> 01:23:43.680
It's <i>a...</i>

01:23:44.914 --> 01:23:48.049
<i>It's a downward spiral...</i>

01:23:48.051 --> 01:23:50.751
<i>...to the end of all times.</i>

01:23:50.753 --> 01:23:52.454
<i>And, uh...</i>

01:23:52.456 --> 01:23:55.824
<i>...there's no chance
that we can survive.</i>

01:23:55.826 --> 01:23:57.392
All talk, no action.

01:23:57.394 --> 01:24:00.928
<i>It's an absolute joke.</i>

01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:04.331
<i>Evan, that's
what you didn't get.</i>

01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:05.733
That's what you didn't get.

01:24:05.735 --> 01:24:07.802
You think people are equal.
They're not.

01:24:07.804 --> 01:24:10.472
<i>They're not.
I want you to change the world.</i>

01:24:10.474 --> 01:24:12.406
<i>And don't think
it'll change peacefully</i>

01:24:12.408 --> 01:24:14.275
<i>or you can do it alone.</i>

01:24:14.277 --> 01:24:16.244
You need to kill the rich.

01:24:16.246 --> 01:24:17.611
<i>I had to kill a lot of people,</i>

01:24:17.613 --> 01:24:21.950
<i>and I will get killed myself
to get my message to you.</i>

01:24:21.952 --> 01:24:23.852
So I made the decision

01:24:23.854 --> 01:24:26.854
to value your interests
higher than my life.

01:24:26.856 --> 01:24:31.295
<i>I wanna make you
wake up and change.</i>

01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:37.232
And I will get killed myself
to get my message to you.

01:24:37.234 --> 01:24:38.400
<i>So I made the decision</i>

01:24:38.402 --> 01:24:41.236
<i>to value your interests
higher than my life.</i>

01:24:41.238 --> 01:24:43.772
<i>Your interests higher
than my life.</i>

01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:48.945
<i>And I will get killed myself
to deliver my message to you.</i>

01:25:46.336 --> 01:25:48.204
It's okay.

01:25:50.073 --> 01:25:51.909
I'm done.

01:26:46.997 --> 01:26:49.296
<i>Nietzsche once said, uh...</i>

01:26:49.298 --> 01:26:52.032
"On top of the mountain
of wisdom,

01:26:52.034 --> 01:26:55.202
"it's very lonely and ice cold.

01:26:55.204 --> 01:26:59.844
But if you climb it... there's
no bigger gratification."

01:27:02.244 --> 01:27:04.312
Death is coming.

01:27:04.314 --> 01:27:08.516
Death is the result.
It's the consequence.

01:27:08.518 --> 01:27:13.620
So I urge you one last time,
for yourself, for your family,

01:27:13.622 --> 01:27:16.393
to climb that mountaintop.

01:27:17.226 --> 01:27:20.527
You know what I'm talking about.

01:27:20.529 --> 01:27:23.964
This is my last message
to you...

01:27:23.966 --> 01:27:26.069
...in vain.

01:27:27.671 --> 01:27:29.874
All the best.

01:27:32.207 --> 01:27:34.041
We <i>interrupt
your viewing with</i>

01:27:34.043 --> 01:27:35.343
<i>breaking news.</i>

01:27:35.345 --> 01:27:37.711
The number-one
most dangerous terrorist

01:27:37.713 --> 01:27:39.680
on U.S. soil, Bill Williamson,

01:27:39.682 --> 01:27:42.951
<i>has been shot dead
by authorities.</i>

01:27:42.953 --> 01:27:44.352
The case of who killed
the President

01:27:44.354 --> 01:27:46.620
of the United States
is now solved.

01:27:46.622 --> 01:27:49.557
<i>We go live to our
correspondents on location.</i>

01:27:49.559 --> 01:27:50.825
What <i>a
horrific scene, Laurie!</i>

01:27:50.827 --> 01:27:54.161
<i>Where the terrorist
was hiding all this time...</i>

01:27:54.163 --> 01:27:55.162
He wasn't a terrorist,

01:27:55.164 --> 01:27:56.563
you fucking idiot.

01:27:56.565 --> 01:27:59.099
He'd <i>been living</i>
<i>in a system of caves here,</i>

01:27:59.101 --> 01:28:01.169
<i>where we are learning
the FBI has found...</i>

01:28:01.171 --> 01:28:04.004
He was just doing what needed
to be done. Fuck, Bill.

01:28:04.006 --> 01:28:05.473
...the <i>very rifle that killed</i>
<i>the President,</i>

01:28:05.475 --> 01:28:07.275
<i>Vice President
and the Secretary of Defense.</i>

01:28:07.277 --> 01:28:10.711
<i>It looks like the aftermath
of an all-out war...</i>

01:28:10.713 --> 01:28:13.214
<i>Yeah, hi, Ma.
Yeah, can you, uh...</i>

01:28:13.216 --> 01:28:15.650
can you...
can you come grab Billy?

01:28:15.652 --> 01:28:19.320
Take care of him
for a little bit for me?

01:28:19.322 --> 01:28:21.555
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
I just, uh...

01:28:21.557 --> 01:28:26.593
I'm just tired. I'm just
super tired and I, um...

01:28:26.595 --> 01:28:28.629
I just need a break.

01:28:28.631 --> 01:28:30.598
I just need...

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.470
I just need a break, okay, Ma?

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:40.340
We're gonna be okay.

01:28:40.342 --> 01:28:43.146
We're gonna be okay.

01:28:47.117 --> 01:28:51.753
Uh... there's a...
a bunch of terrorists

01:28:51.755 --> 01:28:54.187
going around shooting people.

01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:55.289
Who?

01:28:55.291 --> 01:28:56.758
Look at this. They're just
randomly shooting civilians.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.326
Oh, my God!
Why are they doing this?

01:28:59.328 --> 01:29:01.461
They're killing
all the rich people.

01:29:01.463 --> 01:29:04.598
<i>We are receiving
disturbing news.</i>

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:06.334
<i>From all across America,</i>

01:29:06.336 --> 01:29:10.170
<i>heavily armed terrorists
dressed in black</i>

01:29:10.172 --> 01:29:11.539
<i>are shooting civilians.</i>

01:29:11.541 --> 01:29:14.442
They are mostly targeting
affluent areas,

01:29:14.444 --> 01:29:15.809
including Wall Street.

01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:19.613
<i>There are also reports of them
attacking the headquarters</i>

01:29:19.615 --> 01:29:23.785
<i>of the FBI, CIA,
Homeland Security,</i>

01:29:23.787 --> 01:29:26.353
<i>the NSA,</i>

01:29:26.355 --> 01:29:29.790
<i>DEA and other various
military stations.</i>

01:29:31.394 --> 01:29:35.362
There are over 1,000 shootings
occurring concurrently.

01:29:35.364 --> 01:29:38.499
This seems to be
some kind of revolt

01:29:38.501 --> 01:29:41.701
against the American elite
and decision-makers.

01:29:57.787 --> 01:30:02.025
This <i>is for my son... Billy.</i>

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:07.428
<i>Billy, by the time
you're old enough to, uh...</i>

01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:11.301
<i>to see and understand
this video, um...</i>

01:30:12.469 --> 01:30:16.204
<i>...I won't be
in your life anymore.</i>

01:30:16.206 --> 01:30:19.706
<i>And the fact
that I'm your father is...</i>

01:30:19.708 --> 01:30:23.212
<i>...gonna be
a distant memory for you.</i>

01:30:24.581 --> 01:30:26.746
<i>As much
as I would like this video</i>

01:30:26.748 --> 01:30:28.316
to be your one impression of me,

01:30:28.318 --> 01:30:31.852
<i>I know that's not possible.</i>

01:30:31.854 --> 01:30:36.223
<i>You will hear and read and
see a lot of me in your life,</i>

01:30:36.225 --> 01:30:39.460
<i>but I want you to know
that my life was my own</i>

01:30:39.462 --> 01:30:40.861
<i>and your life has the potential</i>

01:30:40.863 --> 01:30:43.666
<i>to be whatever
you want it to be.</i>

01:30:44.634 --> 01:30:48.169
<i>You only live once, son.</i>

01:30:48.171 --> 01:30:50.303
<i>By the time
you watch this video,</i>

01:30:50.305 --> 01:30:52.205
<i>you might form
your own opinions</i>

01:30:52.207 --> 01:30:56.811
<i>of life and death
and of God, but I...</i>

01:30:56.813 --> 01:31:00.882
<i>Hear me when I tell you this.
There is no God, okay?</i>

01:31:00.884 --> 01:31:05.620
There is no after. <i>What you</i>
<i>have</i> is you have one life.

01:31:05.622 --> 01:31:10.724
And you need to use this life
to make an impact.

01:31:10.726 --> 01:31:12.259
To make it right.

01:31:12.261 --> 01:31:16.630
Because...
people are gonna lie to you.

01:31:16.632 --> 01:31:20.269
They're gonna try
to keep you down.

01:31:24.207 --> 01:31:28.209
<i>They won't want you to succeed.
They, uh...</i>

01:31:28.211 --> 01:31:32.379
<i>They won't want you
to see the truth.</i>

01:31:32.381 --> 01:31:34.749
<i>If you come to the conclusion
that you don't want</i>

01:31:34.751 --> 01:31:37.218
<i>to contribute to a society
where others decide</i>

01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:39.419
<i>what you do
and what you don't do,</i>

01:31:39.421 --> 01:31:42.790
<i>where others use media
and school systems and the law</i>

01:31:42.792 --> 01:31:45.625
<i>that oppresses people
like you and me,</i>

01:31:45.627 --> 01:31:47.727
<i>people that can think
for themselves,</i>

01:31:47.729 --> 01:31:48.862
<i>that still have free will,</i>

01:31:48.864 --> 01:31:52.266
<i>then you need
to destroy those ideas...</i>

01:31:52.268 --> 01:31:54.902
<i>...and the people
and the institutions</i>

01:31:54.904 --> 01:31:57.237
<i>that perpetuate them.</i>

01:31:57.239 --> 01:31:58.373
<i>You need to be a leader,</i>

01:31:58.375 --> 01:32:01.275
<i>and the masses
and the rules and the laws</i>

01:32:01.277 --> 01:32:04.213
<i>and the ideology will change
with your movement.</i>

01:32:08.551 --> 01:32:11.755
<i>I want to tell you
that I'm sorry.</i>

01:32:16.359 --> 01:32:19.763
<i>I wish I could be
the father that...</i>

01:32:20.896 --> 01:32:23.766
<i>...that my father was to me.</i>

01:32:25.368 --> 01:32:26.968
<i>That I wish I...</i>

01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:29.970
I could hold you in my arms.

01:32:29.972 --> 01:32:32.473
And I wish
I could see you grow up.

01:32:32.475 --> 01:32:37.245
And I wish I could speak to you
beyond this video.

01:32:37.247 --> 01:32:40.982
I wish you could feel the love
I have for you in my heart,

01:32:40.984 --> 01:32:43.317
from the moment I saw you.

01:32:43.319 --> 01:32:46.789
I hope that it protects you
for your life.

01:32:48.992 --> 01:32:51.228
I love you.

01:32:52.261 --> 01:32:55.331
I'm so sorry
I had to leave you.

01:32:57.734 --> 01:33:01.605
<i>I hope that you understand
it was for the best.</i>

01:33:03.605 --> 01:33:07.344
<i>And I want you
to take care of your mom, okay?</i>

01:33:08.344 --> 01:33:10.780
<i>Take care of your mom.</i>

01:33:13.916 --> 01:33:15.786
<i>I love you.</i>

01:33:17.819 --> 01:33:20.489
<i>Your father, Bill Williamson.</i>

01:33:28.965 --> 01:33:31.598
There <i>are
reports of heavy gunfire</i>

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.870
<i>in the Senate</i> and
in front of the White House.

01:33:38.807 --> 01:33:41.041
<i>Oh.</i>

01:33:41.043 --> 01:33:46.617
<i>Past President George Bush
has been pronounced dead...</i>

01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:49.416
<i>...as have the CEOs</i>

01:33:49.418 --> 01:33:52.622
<i>of General Electric
and Microsoft.</i>

01:33:56.792 --> 01:33:58.893
We've also just learned
that Mark Zuckerberg

01:33:58.895 --> 01:34:01.795
was killed by one of
his own employees.

01:34:01.797 --> 01:34:07.835
<i>And entertainers Rihanna,
Taylor Swift and Britney Spears</i>

01:34:07.837 --> 01:34:10.804
<i>are also reported as deceased.</i>

01:34:10.806 --> 01:34:14.008
<i>It seems a group
of right-wing anarchists</i>

01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:16.043
have revolted
and have the intent

01:34:16.045 --> 01:34:18.646
to take their country back...

01:34:18.648 --> 01:34:21.752
<i>...through violence
and destruction.</i>

01:34:30.859 --> 01:34:33.027
Ah! Fuck!

01:34:33.029 --> 01:34:35.332
Argh!

01:34:50.579 --> 01:34:53.580
What? Can you...?

01:34:53.582 --> 01:34:56.552
Did you just hear
what they said?

01:34:58.387 --> 01:34:59.786
I didn't.

01:34:59.788 --> 01:35:02.857
What's happening?

01:35:02.859 --> 01:35:06.026
Can you guys tell us
what's happening outside?

01:35:06.028 --> 01:35:07.995
- What is it?
- I'll just be right back.

01:35:07.997 --> 01:35:09.629
That sounds really close.

01:35:09.631 --> 01:35:12.568
Security?!

01:35:25.782 --> 01:35:30.017
<i>When are you gonna
get off your ass, huh?</i>

01:35:30.019 --> 01:35:31.922
<i>And do something?</i>

01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:38.625
Bill Williamson
changed my life.

01:35:38.627 --> 01:35:40.928
That was for him!
