where the medal is or not?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.182
Not.
He said that

10:18.226 --> 10:20.837
we were a disgrace to the Navy.

10:20.881 --> 10:23.274
Gibbs, he only wantsto talk to you.

10:26.364 --> 10:29.019
Agent Gibbs...Omar, don't talkto me now.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.726
Got a place for empties?

10:39.769 --> 10:42.424
I've got a grievingfamily upstairs.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.600
One way or another,that Purple Heart

10:44.644 --> 10:46.950
is going back to them.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.648
Where is it?

10:48.691 --> 10:50.780
What do you know about war?

10:50.824 --> 10:53.174
Look, you gotyour root beer.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.176
You got me.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.699
Time to talk.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.222
It ain't about

10:58.266 --> 11:00.311
a fizzy drink.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.878
It's about

11:01.922 --> 11:04.446
getting someone with perspective

11:04.489 --> 11:06.013
to set it down,

11:06.056 --> 11:08.319
to sit down in front of me...

11:08.363 --> 11:10.365
and listen.

11:19.766 --> 11:20.941
[clears throat]

11:20.984 --> 11:24.031
What do you knowabout war, son?

11:24.074 --> 11:27.338
Enough to know
I don't want to go back.Well, I do.

11:27.382 --> 11:31.125
December 7, 1941.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.562
Attack on Pearl Harbor.

11:33.605 --> 11:37.348
I was on the USS Arizona.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.960
When I die,

11:40.003 --> 11:41.962
I want my ashes

11:42.005 --> 11:43.964
interred on that ship.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.749
Any survivor of the Arizona
has the right

11:46.793 --> 11:47.924
to be laid to rest there.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.710
Yeah. [chuckles] Well...

11:50.753 --> 11:53.756
February '41,

11:53.800 --> 11:56.063
I enlisted in the Navy.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.586
If you do the math...

11:57.629 --> 11:58.892
You were too young.I...

11:58.935 --> 12:01.068
was only 16.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.461
I had an older brother.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.855
Henry Smith was his name.

12:05.899 --> 12:09.729
I used his birth certificateto join.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.949
I served under his name.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.780
But I'm telling you, I served.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.869
Have to confirm that.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.871
It'll take time.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.308
Red tape means years.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.920
I'm 95 years old.

12:28.443 --> 12:31.489
I read an article about

12:31.533 --> 12:33.709
Admiral Caplinger.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.189
Said he used to be

12:35.232 --> 12:37.800
commanderof the Pacific Fleet.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.020
He attended every interment

12:40.063 --> 12:42.631
on the USS Arizona

12:42.674 --> 12:44.198
when he was out there.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.026
That means

12:46.069 --> 12:48.811
he's got connections.

12:48.855 --> 12:52.119
He's got perspective.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.034
So, I wrote him,

12:54.077 --> 12:56.819
asked him for his help.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.865
Three letters.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.998
He never answered any of them.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.565
He was at sea.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.741
I want it from the admiral
in writing,

13:05.785 --> 13:07.961
with his signature,

13:08.004 --> 13:11.834
saying my ashes will be interred

13:11.878 --> 13:13.836
on that ship.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.621
Once I have that,I'll give him back

13:16.665 --> 13:18.798
his Purple Heart.

13:18.841 --> 13:19.842
It's not the way to do it.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.932
You see that?

13:22.976 --> 13:24.760
I'm telling you,

13:24.804 --> 13:27.023
I was on the Arizona

13:27.067 --> 13:28.938
when those bombs hit.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.245
And I want his word

13:31.288 --> 13:33.638
that I'll be laid to rest there.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.684
Blackmail is not the way
to get it done.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.078
I tried to do it the right way.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.515
Now I'm doing it my way.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.963
On the morning
of December 7, 1941,

13:54.007 --> 13:56.357
the Japanese
launched a surprise attack

13:56.400 --> 13:59.664
on the U.S. Naval base
at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.972
Now, 15 minutes in,
a Kate attack plane dropped

14:03.016 --> 14:05.757
an 800-kilogram bomb
onto the USS Arizona.

14:05.801 --> 14:09.109
It ignited a million pounds
of gunpowder

14:09.152 --> 14:12.939
in a cataclysmic explosion
that tore the ship apart

14:12.982 --> 14:15.289
and sunk it.TORRES:
Over 2,400

14:15.332 --> 14:17.900
Americans diedin the attack of Pearl Harbor.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.773
And almost half were
crewmen aboard the Arizona.

14:21.817 --> 14:25.125
I started looking stuff up, too,after Joe shamed us.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.475
Hmm. Well, this

14:27.518 --> 14:31.261
is the USS Arizona
Memorial in Pearl Harbor.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.480
That's where Joe
wants to be buried?

14:32.523 --> 14:33.785
Yeah, the wreckage of the ship

14:33.829 --> 14:35.091
is still underwater.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.963
And any survivorof the Arizona

14:37.006 --> 14:39.095
can have their ashes
placed within the ship,

14:39.139 --> 14:40.836
among their fallen comrades.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.098
Where are we
with Joe Smith?

14:42.142 --> 14:43.317
Well, the math
checks out.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.797
Yeah, Joe, uh,turned 16 in January

14:45.841 --> 14:47.625
of 1941, and
there is a record

14:47.669 --> 14:50.150
of a Henry Smith
having enlisted in the Navy

14:50.193 --> 14:52.935
in February of '41
at the age of 18.

14:52.979 --> 14:56.112
He served as an electrician's
mate aboard the Arizona.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.767
That was Joe, serving
under his brother's name.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.074
Well, actually, we're not sure
which one of them that is.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.989
The rest of the
service records

15:03.032 --> 15:05.469
for Henry Smith
were lost in the war.

15:05.513 --> 15:09.082
Got a picture of the brother?No. Joe said he wasn't
big into pictures.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.084
He wasn't big on his
brother, either. They were

15:11.127 --> 15:13.086
estranged,
and brother Henry died

15:13.129 --> 15:15.392
in a car accident
at the age of 30.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.481
Well, put Joe's picture up.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.963
That him or not?

15:21.007 --> 15:23.487
Well, the bone structure
is similar,

15:23.531 --> 15:27.100
but it's impossible to say
for sure if that's Joe.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.145
JIMMY:
Almost done here, Joe.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.538
Well, make it quick.

15:30.581 --> 15:33.976
I didn't sign upto be prodded like a 4-H hog.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.325
Um, you should be happy

15:35.369 --> 15:36.979
that we're trying
to help you out at all.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.851
I didn't askfor a nanny up my ass, either.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.505
Actually, you did.
See, when you confess

15:41.549 --> 15:43.638
to a crime,
you earn yourself an escort.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.031
What's his problem?

15:45.074 --> 15:46.728
Oh, he's been getting
some annoying phone calls.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.643
He's usually way more
pleasant than this.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.514
Hey.I mean, uh...

15:50.558 --> 15:53.474
Well, at any rate, uh,

15:53.517 --> 15:55.911
Joe, your scars are consistent
with third-degree burns

15:55.955 --> 15:58.348
that occurred a significant
amount of time ago.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.350
And the majority
of Arizonasurvivors

16:00.394 --> 16:02.787
did suffer burns
from the fires.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.137
There you go.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.661
I like this kid.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.184
I was also ableto dig up your brother's

16:08.228 --> 16:10.839
1953 autopsy report.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.015
It says that
he was killed instantly

16:13.059 --> 16:16.192
when his head hit
the car windshield, and...

16:18.716 --> 16:20.544
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

16:20.588 --> 16:22.416
Idiot had a few in him.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.853
Got what was coming to him.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.334
Well, bottom line,there's no mention

16:27.377 --> 16:31.207
of any previous scarsor injuries on Henry's body.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.035
Ah.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.168
Thank you, my friend.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.647
Thank you.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.345
Wait a second. That
doesn't prove anything.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.477
The explosion on the Arizona
threw some men overboard

16:40.521 --> 16:42.044
that weren't burned at all.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.133
What do you call that?

16:44.177 --> 16:46.048
A rug burn?

16:46.092 --> 16:49.051
[scoffs]Wait.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.488
Where are you going? Joe...
Where is he going?

16:52.924 --> 16:56.058
Joe? Joe, listen to me.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.712
I want to believe
you, okay?

16:57.755 --> 17:00.062
We all want
to believe you.Yeah.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.760
Then tell the admiralto pull a few strings.

17:02.804 --> 17:06.590
No, Admiral Caplinger has no
real power in this situation.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.027
This all comes
down to us proving

17:08.070 --> 17:09.071
that you were
on that ship.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.594
So the best thing
for you to do is

17:10.638 --> 17:12.161
tell us where the
Purple Heart is.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.990
Then we can release you
and we can focus on the case.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.992
Nah.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.560
I'm not falling for that.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.388
What?I know the drill.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.477
Old people get conned

17:23.520 --> 17:26.306
and then tossed aside.

17:26.349 --> 17:29.135
Joe. Joe?

17:29.178 --> 17:33.139
The medal stayswhere it is as...

17:34.140 --> 17:35.097
What do you call 'em?

17:35.141 --> 17:36.925
What?

17:36.968 --> 17:39.319
Leverage.Where are you even
going right now?

17:39.362 --> 17:42.278
You realize that you're not
in charge here, right?

17:45.151 --> 17:47.196
Okay, fine.
You're in charge.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.198
You have all the leverage.
Is that what you want to hear?

17:49.242 --> 17:51.505
I want to hearthat you got some DNA proof

17:51.548 --> 17:53.376
that I was on the Arizona.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.987
I was in the hospitalwith my burn right after.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.642
Track down some old jarwith a skin sample.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.514
I know how it works.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.603
I watched CSI.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.518
Actually, our best bet
at proving it is

18:04.561 --> 18:06.563
for you to tell us
everything you can remember

18:06.607 --> 18:07.956
about the attack.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.393
I don't think so.Look, we're out of leads here.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.265
Okay? So any detail
that you can remember

18:12.308 --> 18:14.397
about that day--
it could lead us...I told you,

18:14.441 --> 18:16.007
I'm not talking about it.I thought you wanted

18:16.051 --> 18:18.140
someone to sit down
in front of you and listen.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.576
I've said my piece.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.143
Now I'm done talking.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.666
Go get the DNA

18:22.710 --> 18:25.278
and be grumpy someplace else.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.150
Life's too short
to get all out of shape

18:28.194 --> 18:31.806
over crap phone calls,
you schmuck.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.507
[scoffs]

18:37.551 --> 18:38.987
SLOANE:
At home

18:39.030 --> 18:41.381
in the middle of a workday?What you up to?

18:41.424 --> 18:43.383
Well, I'm working.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.385
Okay.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.343
Uh, listen, I looked
at the recordings

18:47.387 --> 18:49.606
from Interrogation.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.131
From what I can tell,
Joe is hiding something.

18:52.174 --> 18:55.003
Jack, that's who these guys are.They hide everything.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.613
And by "these guys,"
you mean

18:56.657 --> 18:59.790
World War II vets
like your dad?

18:59.834 --> 19:01.227
What do you got?

19:01.270 --> 19:03.620
Kasie tracked down
a surveillance camera

19:03.664 --> 19:05.622
outside of the motel.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.147
Joe wasn't traveling
on foot after all.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.670
You find the cab?

19:09.713 --> 19:11.106
Bishop's working on it.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.021
Good chance that the cabbie
might know something

19:13.064 --> 19:14.849
about what Joe did
with the Purple Heart.

19:14.892 --> 19:18.113
In order to find the medal,

19:18.157 --> 19:20.507
we got to get Joe to talk.Ah!

19:20.550 --> 19:22.683
To prove he wason the Arizona,

19:22.726 --> 19:24.685
we got to get Joe to talk.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.123
Huh. And according to McGee...

19:28.167 --> 19:29.777
[grunts]

19:31.170 --> 19:33.128
...Joe refuses
to speak at all now.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.652
He thinks we can prove
his story with DNA.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.524
Yeah, so I heard.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.962
Two things get my dad talk.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.707
This is one of 'em.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.752
A slide projector?

19:48.796 --> 19:52.365
Something about watching
memories in a dark room

19:52.408 --> 19:53.975
makes one feel safe, maybe?

19:54.018 --> 19:56.195
Oh, yeah.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.762
And what was the other thing
that got your dad talking?

20:00.547 --> 20:03.071
Having a job to do.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.551
Hmm.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.513
Appreciate the help.Mm.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.950
You know, figured you being
an electrician and all.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.735
We got time to kill.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.954
DNA doesn't work as fast

20:16.998 --> 20:20.001
they make it seem on TV.

20:20.044 --> 20:23.134
You doing some kind
of slide show for the family?

20:23.178 --> 20:26.703
No. I wanted to fix
it for a friend.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.705
I was never bigon pictures.

20:28.749 --> 20:32.709
My mom had a fewI was supposed to end up with,

20:32.753 --> 20:36.583
but she sent me to livewith my uncle.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.107
My brother was supposedto pick me up.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.717
He didn't.

20:40.761 --> 20:43.720
So, that's the end of that.

20:43.764 --> 20:46.593
Ah.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.553
You're looking at me

20:50.597 --> 20:53.730
like I spent 95 years without...

20:53.774 --> 20:55.341
Hmm?

20:55.384 --> 20:58.039
[laughs]

20:59.867 --> 21:02.043
I knew... love.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.133
I did.

21:05.176 --> 21:08.876
It just never,ever lasts, does it?

21:14.664 --> 21:16.666
Ah.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.717
Hey.Uh.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.764
I did it!

21:27.808 --> 21:30.289
I still got it.
[laughs]

21:41.343 --> 21:42.518
You said you were

21:42.562 --> 21:44.781
doing this for a friend.I am.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.740
I'm not your friend.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.263
What is this?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.134
Some kind of trick

21:50.178 --> 21:52.267
to make me talk about it?

21:52.311 --> 21:55.792
I told you to do your DNA thing.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.794
Joe, we got nothing.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.796
We need something to go on here.The things

21:59.840 --> 22:03.017
I saw that day shouldn't comeout of anyone's mouth.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.193
You've seen war.

22:05.236 --> 22:07.021
How many people

22:07.064 --> 22:09.545
did you tellabout the worst of it?

22:09.589 --> 22:11.242
Hey.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.549
If it was so bad,

22:13.593 --> 22:15.638
why do you want to
be buried there?

22:15.682 --> 22:19.860
Why are you asking me questionsyou know the answers to?

22:21.905 --> 22:23.907
Just leave me alone.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.013
What are we
doing here?

22:43.057 --> 22:45.494
Seriously?
I just told you.

22:45.538 --> 22:46.974
Oh, yeah. I
wasn't listening.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.324
I was reading about
Pearl Harbor on my phone.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.892
If that dude's gonna quiz me
again, I'm gonna be ready.

22:51.935 --> 22:54.851
Well, the guy who dropped
off Joe at the motel drives

22:54.895 --> 22:56.810
cab number 6234.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.855
Name is Kevin Deacon.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.161
Uh, excuse me.

23:00.204 --> 23:02.076
We're lookingfor a driver named Kevin Deacon.

23:02.119 --> 23:05.079
Yeah. Second cab is his.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.515
He went around the corner
to get some coffee.

23:06.559 --> 23:07.516
Should be right back.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.213
Thank you.

23:09.257 --> 23:10.911
[phone rings]

23:13.783 --> 23:16.003
McGee.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.396
Aunt Lupe.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.527
Oh, thank God you called.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.529
Uh, I-I've been waiting...

23:20.573 --> 23:23.314
Ooh. No hablo español.

23:23.358 --> 23:26.187
Uh... uno momento.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.972
Tell her to send out the rightRSVP number to everyone.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.104
Okay.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.541
Aló?

23:32.585 --> 23:33.890
Sí.

23:33.934 --> 23:36.110
No, no, no, no, es su amigo.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.155
Ah, qué bonito.Okay.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.331
[speaks Spanish]
Okay, muy bien.

23:40.375 --> 23:43.726
El estará allí.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.032
Gracias.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.774
Be there at 6:00. You're
bringing the enchiladas.

23:47.817 --> 23:48.992
Wait, what?

23:49.036 --> 23:50.167
Yeah, she felt so bad
about the trouble

23:50.211 --> 23:52.779
that, uh, she invited
you to the party.

23:52.822 --> 23:55.869
It'd be so rude to not
show up for Tía Lupe.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.134
That's our guy.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.529
Hey, uh, Kevin Deacon?

24:04.573 --> 24:06.096
Yeah.

24:06.140 --> 24:09.056
NCIS. You dropped offa fare this morning

24:09.099 --> 24:10.840
at the Stargazer Motel?

24:13.103 --> 24:15.497
Someone needs to move this cab.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.890
Hey, you got to get this
out of the way!

24:27.553 --> 24:29.468
Yes, sir, understood.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.947
Admiral Caplinger.

24:30.991 --> 24:33.036
He's done playing
the old man's games.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.777
He wants to press charges.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.257
We got a lot of loose ends
around here.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.912
Cabbie. He ran.
We don't know why.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.261
Actually, I have an idea.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.262
Seems that Mr. Deacon

24:41.305 --> 24:43.090
has a rap sheet a mile long

24:43.133 --> 24:44.178
for fraud.Yeah.

24:44.221 --> 24:45.745
So?Gibbs, I know

24:45.788 --> 24:47.137
that you believe Joe.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.922
I know that you respect him.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.967
But we have to consider
the alternative.

24:51.011 --> 24:52.534
You think he's lying.Look,

24:52.578 --> 24:54.884
the cabbie ran as soon as he
knew we were there about Joe.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.407
This could all be
some sort of a con.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.671
Could be Joe refuses
to talk about Pearl Harbor

24:58.714 --> 25:00.150
because he wasn't there.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.761
Because his brotherwas the one

25:01.804 --> 25:03.110
who served and not him.No.

25:03.153 --> 25:04.807
I'm not buying it.
Why would he lie about that?

25:04.851 --> 25:05.982
Stolen valor?

25:06.026 --> 25:07.636
I-It happens
all the time.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.203
Joe and his brother
were estranged.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.292
This could be
Joe's final victory

25:11.335 --> 25:12.859
in his family beef.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.774
Or who knows? It could befor financial gain.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.210
What the hell
are you doing, Jack?

25:16.253 --> 25:17.864
What am I doing?
What are youdoing?

25:17.907 --> 25:19.256
Gibbs,

25:19.300 --> 25:20.693
take a look at what's
in front of us

25:20.736 --> 25:22.999
and tell me what we're doing
for the victims here.

25:23.043 --> 25:24.392
I want you to charge

25:24.435 --> 25:26.481
Joe Smith with theft,
breaking and entering

25:26.525 --> 25:29.266
and obstruction of justice.I'm not doing that, Leon.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.573
He's not lying.

25:31.617 --> 25:34.271
You cannot ask me
to walk in there

25:34.315 --> 25:36.883
and tell him
that we've given up on him.Gibbs.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.275
Just because
you knew your father

25:38.319 --> 25:40.539
does not mean you know Joe.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.853
[door closes]

25:53.377 --> 25:55.379
I said to leave me be.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.820
We found the cabbie

26:00.863 --> 26:02.822
that dropped you off
at the motel.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.693
He ran from us, Joe.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.216
You know why?

26:06.260 --> 26:08.218
I don't know.He know where the
Purple Heart is?

26:08.262 --> 26:09.829
No.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.876
Heard there might be fireworks.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.443
You really think
Joe's lying?

26:15.486 --> 26:16.966
No idea.What?

26:17.010 --> 26:19.142
You made a pretty good caseup in my office.

26:19.186 --> 26:22.058
Yeah, well, it could allbe true or not.

26:22.102 --> 26:24.670
Either way, Gibbs needed
a push to find out.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.020
Oh, wow.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.978
Full house here, huh?

26:29.022 --> 26:31.807
Hey, Joe. Look at me.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.292
This all some kind of con?

26:38.335 --> 26:41.904
Con? You thinkthis is some kind of con?

26:41.948 --> 26:43.514
The Arizona.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.604
Were you on it or not?

26:46.692 --> 26:48.302
Would you like meto show you

26:48.345 --> 26:49.738
my arm again?No.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.611
No, I want you
to prove it to me.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.134
You prove it!

26:55.657 --> 26:57.093
That's your job!

26:57.137 --> 26:58.573
Get the DNA.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.010
There is no DNA, Joe.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.493
You are the only DNA we have.

27:05.536 --> 27:08.627
What's in your head?
Your story? Something.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.630
Anything that we can verify.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.729
What do you think you're doing?

27:26.035 --> 27:29.038
You say you wereon the Arizona.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.692
What'd you see, Joe?

27:31.737 --> 27:33.042
Huh?

27:34.348 --> 27:35.349
What'd you smell?

27:38.091 --> 27:39.962
What'd you taste?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.012
Damn it, Joe.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.667
You want to go back? There's
only one way to go back.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.277
Right now.

27:51.365 --> 27:54.673
Was it your brother
or was it you?

27:54.716 --> 27:55.761
It was me!

28:02.376 --> 28:05.161
I was on the quarterdeck,

28:05.205 --> 28:07.903
waiting for colors.

28:07.947 --> 28:11.777
And then me and Ozzie O'Connor
were-were gonna

28:11.820 --> 28:14.170
catch the liberty launch

28:14.214 --> 28:16.346
and toss the football

28:16.390 --> 28:18.479
on the beach.

28:19.654 --> 28:22.788
Then I hearda plane approaching.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.097
I looked up.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.408
I saw the red ball on its wing,

28:34.451 --> 28:37.367
and I knew.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.195
I ran to my battle station

28:39.239 --> 28:41.458
in the gun pit,

28:41.502 --> 28:45.419
and that's when we caught
the big bomb.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.160
[sobs]

28:47.203 --> 28:50.598
It was like the devil
opened his mouth

28:50.641 --> 28:52.731
and made a noise

28:52.774 --> 28:55.211
that was all screaming.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.170
The steel!

28:57.213 --> 28:59.085
The fire!

29:01.565 --> 29:03.785
The men.

29:05.569 --> 29:08.529
I got orders to go topside.

29:08.572 --> 29:11.793
What I saw was body parts

29:11.837 --> 29:14.143
all over the deck.

29:14.187 --> 29:16.885
Men stumbling through,

29:16.929 --> 29:18.800
no hair,

29:18.844 --> 29:20.106
no clothes...

29:21.847 --> 29:24.719
...charred to the bone.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.113
The smell...

29:27.156 --> 29:29.071
[exclaims]

29:29.115 --> 29:31.334
I threw up.

29:32.988 --> 29:36.078
That's when the plane...

29:36.122 --> 29:39.865
strafed us again.

29:39.908 --> 29:43.738
My arm was screaming,

29:43.782 --> 29:45.914
like nerves exposed.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.962
Shrapnel was hitting

29:50.005 --> 29:52.442
what was already raw.

29:53.879 --> 29:57.752
I was loaded intoa rescue launch.

29:57.796 --> 30:01.016
I pulled three men
out of the water.

30:01.060 --> 30:04.019
Two I didn't know.
The third...

30:05.891 --> 30:08.676
The third was Ozzie...

30:11.026 --> 30:12.767
...O'Connor.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.814
He was trying to put
a piece of flesh

30:15.857 --> 30:18.904
back on his face.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.993
I remember thinking about

30:21.036 --> 30:22.995
all the times

30:23.038 --> 30:24.823
his mother must have

30:24.866 --> 30:27.347
kissed that cheek.

30:27.390 --> 30:30.393
And how we should have been

30:30.437 --> 30:33.962
tossing a football.

30:34.006 --> 30:36.878
Then I got hit by...

30:36.922 --> 30:40.273
God knows what.

30:40.316 --> 30:43.842
I fell in the water,

30:43.885 --> 30:46.845
woke up in the hospital.

30:46.888 --> 30:50.500
I don't even know...

30:50.544 --> 30:53.155
who rescued me.

30:53.199 --> 30:56.724
The point is,we saved each other.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.510
All of us.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.385
You've been in a war.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.868
You know why I want to go back.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.306
Shipmates are your brothers.

31:13.349 --> 31:16.135
More than my own blood.

31:16.178 --> 31:19.312
A bond...

31:19.355 --> 31:21.531
that never leaves.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.187
I want to be laid to rest

31:25.231 --> 31:27.233
with my family.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.584
I want to go home.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.168
This is what you wanted, Joe.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.609
With my signature.

31:56.784 --> 31:57.828
When you die,

31:57.872 --> 31:59.874
your ashes will be

31:59.918 --> 32:02.921
interred on the Arizona.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.191
But we still don't
have any hard proof.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.627
Can Gibbs really promise that?

32:13.670 --> 32:16.847
No. No, he can't.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.504
Joe?

32:21.548 --> 32:23.506
All right, then.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.987
I'll take you

32:26.031 --> 32:28.468
to the Purple Heart.

32:28.511 --> 32:31.340
It's back at the hotel.

32:33.299 --> 32:34.474
I don't get it.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.041
How could the Purple
Heart be at the motel?

32:36.084 --> 32:37.346
We searched that place,
like, five times.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.000
Well, we should'vedone it six.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.349
We got a hit
on the BOLO.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.611
Cabbie Deacon?

32:41.655 --> 32:43.091
Yeah, MPD picked him up
for speeding.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.224
They're holding him for us.I'll update Vance.

32:51.752 --> 32:54.320
Look, man,
I can't go back to prison.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.626
And what exactly were you afraidyou'd be going back for?

32:56.670 --> 32:59.455
Mr. Deacon,the more cooperation

32:59.499 --> 33:02.197
we get here, the more
a judge might understand.

33:03.242 --> 33:05.026
Yesterday, I dropped off a fare

33:05.070 --> 33:07.115
across the street
from the old man's place.

33:07.159 --> 33:08.551
You know him?Uh-uh. He saw me.

33:08.595 --> 33:09.900
He called me over.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.946
He was outside getting some airor something.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.340
What did he say?He offered me 200 bucks
on top of my fare

33:14.383 --> 33:15.602
to drive him around.

33:15.645 --> 33:16.646
All I had to do
was show up today,

33:16.690 --> 33:19.345
pretend to be his
grandson, and...

33:19.388 --> 33:20.694
sign him out.

33:20.737 --> 33:21.912
Sign him out of where?

33:21.956 --> 33:23.610
The nursing home.
That's where he lives.

33:23.653 --> 33:25.220
I mean, they made it
seem like the guy

33:25.264 --> 33:26.526
ain't doing too good, like...

33:26.569 --> 33:28.832
he's really
sick, man.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.574
Purple Heart's right in there.

33:42.455 --> 33:44.413
You use a screwdriver?No, wouldn't need one.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.024
It just popped right off.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.159
You know,

33:51.203 --> 33:52.639
I didn't want to...

33:52.682 --> 33:54.771
talk about that day.

33:54.815 --> 33:57.470
But I feel like

33:57.513 --> 34:00.908
I did something that kept it
from being forgotten.

34:03.563 --> 34:06.087
You want to talk
about what you saw?

34:08.524 --> 34:09.743
Uh,

34:09.786 --> 34:11.266
it may...

34:11.310 --> 34:13.268
make you lighter, too.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.530
Hmm?

34:16.532 --> 34:17.620
Come on.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.492
Give it a shot, son.

34:26.673 --> 34:27.761
It's empty.

34:27.804 --> 34:29.067
What?

34:29.110 --> 34:31.330
That's impossible.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.984
Yeah, I'm telling you,
there's nothing in there.

34:34.028 --> 34:35.682
No, I-I put it in there.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.075
I know I s...

34:37.118 --> 34:38.511
It was, uh...
[groans]

34:38.554 --> 34:40.513
It was just... [groans]

34:40.556 --> 34:42.471
Joe. Joseph.I put it in the
safest place possible.

34:42.515 --> 34:44.908
I was always gonnagive it back.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.302
Sit down. Joe.[groaning]

34:47.346 --> 34:48.608
Joe.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.349
[exhales]

34:58.705 --> 35:00.054
Hey.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.577
So, how is he?

35:01.621 --> 35:03.623
It was
a massive heart attack.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.842
He's in surgery.[sighs]

35:05.886 --> 35:07.496
Well, we, uh...

35:07.540 --> 35:09.585
we spoke to the nursing
home where Joe lives.

35:09.629 --> 35:12.632
He was being treated for
coronary artery disease,

35:12.675 --> 35:14.895
and he's in the early
stages of dementia.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.070
What?Yeah.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.680
How early?

35:17.724 --> 35:19.291
McGEE:
Nurse says he has his good
days and his bad days,

35:19.334 --> 35:21.902
but he was diagnosed before
he started writing letters

35:21.945 --> 35:23.904
to the admiral.[sighs]

35:23.947 --> 35:25.906
He knew the endwas coming.

35:25.949 --> 35:28.691
He wanted to make sure his asheswere back on the Arizona.

35:28.735 --> 35:29.953
SLOANE:
Or maybe

35:29.997 --> 35:31.955
he was just confused.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.044
What if Joe's memories
were really just stories

35:34.088 --> 35:35.829
his brother told him?

35:35.872 --> 35:38.527
This whole thing could
just be in his head.

35:40.747 --> 35:41.965
Hey, did you findanything?

35:42.009 --> 35:44.098
Nope. We, uh...
we questioned Deacon again.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.056
He swears he never
saw a Purple Heart,

35:46.100 --> 35:48.015
and he said that Joe
never even mentioned it.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.887
You search the cab?Yeah, and it wasn'tat Deacon's place either.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.454
So Joe's the only onewho knows what he did with it,

35:52.498 --> 35:54.152
and now even he doesn't know.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.197
Well, that mightnot be entirely true.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.590
According to Gibbs,

35:57.633 --> 35:59.766
Joe insists that he put
the medal in a safe place.

35:59.809 --> 36:02.203
That feeling was probably real.Yeah, well,

36:02.247 --> 36:03.422
feeling isn't
really much to go on.

36:03.465 --> 36:05.075
Yeah, he could've buried it
anywhere

36:05.119 --> 36:07.426
and thought that he put it
in the vent.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.645
Or, more likely,
he could've just transposed

36:09.689 --> 36:11.169
a few of the details.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.345
You mean like maybe
it was a different vent?

36:13.388 --> 36:17.349
BISHOP:
So, Joe knew that
he removed a vent cover

36:17.392 --> 36:19.351
and put the Purple Heart
inside.

36:19.394 --> 36:21.353
We think he remembered

36:21.396 --> 36:24.138
the location
of the vent incorrectly.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.184
[soft clattering]

36:26.227 --> 36:28.621
Well, he didn't need
a screwdriver.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.453
It's here.

36:34.496 --> 36:37.195
[gasps, chuckles]

36:45.725 --> 36:47.640
Is it damaged?

36:51.731 --> 36:54.124
No.[chuckles]

36:54.168 --> 36:56.039
It's perfect.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.127
Thank you.

36:57.171 --> 36:59.086
Thank you.
[sniffles]

36:59.129 --> 37:01.088
Hey, Gibbs. We found it.

37:01.131 --> 37:02.568
Joe was right.

37:02.611 --> 37:05.310
He kept it
in the safest place possible.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.137
Never even left the house.

37:07.181 --> 37:09.749
That's great, Bishop.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.229
That's good work.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.232
Uh, I'll call you back.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.450
Agent Gibbs,

37:15.494 --> 37:17.147
we did all we could.

37:17.191 --> 37:20.455
Unfortunately,
Mr. Smith died in recovery.

37:20.499 --> 37:23.589
Do you knowwhere the body should be sent?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.118
JIMMY:
Your hunch was right, Gibbs.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.382
I was able to find two piecesof metal embedded in the skin

38:17.425 --> 38:18.905
beneath Joe's burns.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.254
"Shrapnel

38:20.298 --> 38:22.256
hit what was already raw."

38:22.300 --> 38:23.344
That's exactly what Joe said.

38:23.388 --> 38:24.911
He wasn't kidding.

38:24.954 --> 38:27.261
Kasie was also able to determinethat one of the pieces

38:27.305 --> 38:28.349
was actually a minuscule...

38:28.393 --> 38:30.786
It was part of a bolt, Gibbs,

38:30.830 --> 38:31.874
complete with
fire damage.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.920
There's a...

38:33.963 --> 38:36.096
I'm sorry, Dr. Palmer.
I-I got a little excited.

38:36.139 --> 38:37.663
By all means, sir, it's all you.

38:37.706 --> 38:40.361
So, a section of the
USS Arizona'ssuperstructure

38:40.405 --> 38:43.146
is on display at the Arizona
State Capitol Museum.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.975
I made a call and I was able
to convince a very nice lady

38:46.019 --> 38:47.281
to rush us a sample

38:47.325 --> 38:48.717
of one of these bolts.

38:56.986 --> 38:58.118
It's a match.

38:58.161 --> 38:59.598
Mm-hmm.So not only

38:59.641 --> 39:00.990
was Joe on the Arizona

39:01.034 --> 39:02.601
when it was attacked,he also has been carrying

39:02.644 --> 39:06.169
a tiny piece of the ship
inside of him ever since.

39:06.213 --> 39:07.997
VANCE:I called the memorial.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.999
They're making arrangements
now for Joe's interment.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.479
Gibbs,

39:11.523 --> 39:13.307
Joe's going back to the Arizona.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.884
[knocking]Hey.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.059
Hey, boss.

39:27.147 --> 39:28.583
It's over there, by the door.

39:28.627 --> 39:30.803
Ah. Great.

39:30.846 --> 39:33.458
The longer you marinate
steaks, the better they are.

39:33.501 --> 39:35.024
Oh, no,I'm actually, uh...

39:35.068 --> 39:37.026
I'm actually gonna use itfor enchiladas.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.419
Yeah, Torres says that, uh,

39:38.463 --> 39:40.421
grilling 'em really brings it
to the next level.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.032
It's for that, uh, party
next weekend I had mentioned.

39:43.076 --> 39:44.947
I'm actually
looking forward to going.

39:44.991 --> 39:46.993
Yeah, well, keep it
as long as you need it.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.473
Thanks.

39:48.516 --> 39:51.084
Um, boss, listen, uh,

39:51.127 --> 39:53.478
I know, uh...

39:53.521 --> 39:56.698
I know that Joe didn'tlike me very much, but, uh,

39:56.742 --> 39:58.483
you sure you don't want meto go with you?

39:58.526 --> 40:00.006
Oh, he liked you, McGee.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.748
Just how those guys are.

40:02.791 --> 40:03.923
No.

40:03.966 --> 40:04.924
I'm good.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.491
Go home to your family.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.231
Thanks.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.364
All right.

40:11.670 --> 40:12.888
Hey, McGee.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.455
Yeah.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.942
You got a minute?

40:22.985 --> 40:25.510
Yeah.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.120
Yeah.
What's up, boss?

40:34.344 --> 40:37.304
Uh...

40:37.347 --> 40:39.959
I want to tell you
something about Joe.

40:44.616 --> 40:47.053
Something about me.

40:53.102 --> 40:56.192
What I saw in Kuwait--

40:56.236 --> 40:59.195
before that, I was different.

40:59.239 --> 41:02.024
It took something from me.

41:02.068 --> 41:04.070
That's what war does.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.425
Sometimes I think if my girls

41:11.469 --> 41:13.906
had been there
when I got home,

41:13.949 --> 41:16.256
maybe they wouldn't have
recognized me.

41:22.044 --> 41:25.483
Maybe there wouldn't have been
enough of me left

41:25.526 --> 41:27.310
for them to hang on to.

41:29.138 --> 41:31.314
Maybe the best of me

41:31.358 --> 41:33.099
was gone.

41:34.970 --> 41:37.016
You come home

41:37.059 --> 41:38.887
and you're like
half a person.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.195
The other half of you
is still back there,

41:42.238 --> 41:45.851
where at least it made sense.

41:47.243 --> 41:49.202
Where, even with the bullets

41:49.245 --> 41:51.683
and the blood and the chaos,

41:51.726 --> 41:54.076
you knew what mattered.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.124
You knew that
the guy next to you

41:58.167 --> 41:59.952
was willing to die for you

41:59.995 --> 42:01.997
and you for him.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.613
And you look around
and think...

42:10.658 --> 42:13.574
...it shouldn't take a war

42:13.618 --> 42:15.576
to make the world that simple.
