[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty:

00:13.888 --> 00:16.641
-[Kirby] You slept with Fletcher.
-I feel awful about it.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.519
I keep avoiding Fletcher and Ryan,
it's terrible.

00:19.602 --> 00:20.812
-Oliver?
-Who?

00:20.895 --> 00:21.938
My ex from Australia.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.399
You were right to leave.
I took you down a dangerous path.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.693
I need to find the truth out
about my father.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.027
I think he was murdered.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.447
I've tracked down a lead
who can get me closer to the truth.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.449
I really don't want you to do this.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.992
There's something I need to do.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.995
[Adam] The mass is a stage 4 glioblastoma.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.079
So, what do I do now?

00:38.163 --> 00:40.957
I think the time has come
for you to tell the people you love.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.171
[solemn music playing]

01:05.398 --> 01:06.983
That was amazing.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.069
We should start our own race team.

01:09.152 --> 01:13.073
I don't have to drive,
but I did take those turns pretty smooth.

01:13.156 --> 01:17.243
I had a feeling you'd love driving
in circles as fast as you could.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.245
I have a whole list planned.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.331
-Like what? My heart can't take it.
-Mm-hm.

01:21.414 --> 01:25.835
Well, some adventures
will be of a different kind.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.008
Not that I'm complaining,
but what exactly has gotten into you?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.469
[Adam clears throat]

01:34.552 --> 01:36.513
Chief of staff taking the day off?

01:36.596 --> 01:39.724
Going in late. Waiting for Kirby
to come back from her night shoot.

01:39.808 --> 01:44.145
-You went auto racing?
-Yeah. Cristal bought out the speedway.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.773
Her foot was a little heavier
on the pedal than mine was.

01:46.856 --> 01:50.443
That sounds like a lot of excitement
for such an early hour.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.446
It's never too early
to create new memories.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.031
Seems a little unsafe.

01:55.115 --> 01:59.494
Blake, would you go start a bath for us?
Lots of bubbles.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.247
-Mm-hm.
-I'll grab the strawberries and champagne.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.999
I love creating new memories.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.298
Are you insane?

02:12.382 --> 02:15.009
What if you fainted at 100 miles an hour?

02:15.093 --> 02:17.470
I didn't. Look, I've got two options:

02:17.554 --> 02:20.265
A surgery that ends with me
dying on the table,

02:20.348 --> 02:23.059
or chemo that makes me sick,
and I still end up dying.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.727
I'm going with Option 3:

02:24.811 --> 02:28.148
Live life to the fullest
with the short time I have left.

02:30.483 --> 02:31.901
How are you feeling?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.778
That was a long night of work.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.406
I can't believe how exhausted I am.

02:36.489 --> 02:40.493
I used to make fun of models
who complained about their jobs,

02:40.577 --> 02:43.538
-but I take back every nasty thought.
-It's not over yet.

02:43.621 --> 02:47.292
We still got to go to the Cherie Belle
party for their Bellini breakfast.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.544
What? I can't go to a party.

02:49.627 --> 02:50.503
You have to.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.131
You can't miss a chance
to meet Nisha Lockhart.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.008
-I can't?
-She's the head of the company

02:55.091 --> 02:58.011
and personally picking the face
for their next perfume campaign.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.847
She can't pick this face
unless it's in front of her.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.100
She's specifically looking
for new talent to shake things up.

03:04.893 --> 03:08.146
-Unless this isn't something you're into.
-No, I am.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.065
I know I have to do whatever it takes,

03:11.149 --> 03:14.861
I just... wish that staying awake
wasn't what it took right now.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.863
It's going to take more
than staying awake.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.824
Nisha is a perfectionist.
You have to be on.

03:20.658 --> 03:24.829
I'd offer you something,
but you did say that was a one-time thing.

03:25.705 --> 03:29.334
Okay, just to get through the party.
And get this job.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.797
I had to drive to three
different bakeries and one cafÃ©,

03:34.881 --> 03:36.424
but I found your favorite.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.302
A low-fat cran-blueberry muffin
with oat flakes.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.554
What are you doing here?

03:41.638 --> 03:43.932
Did you not just hear my muffin story?

03:44.015 --> 03:47.977
I thought that we haven't been seeing
each other enough or at all,

03:48.061 --> 03:51.314
so I wanted to surprise you with breakfast
before class.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.441
Is this not your favorite muffin?

03:54.150 --> 03:56.819
-No, no, it is. Totally.
-Okay.

03:56.903 --> 04:01.241
It's so sweet of you. It's just, um,
there are a lot of muffins out there,

04:01.324 --> 04:04.702
and, uh, sometimes it gets confusing,
and you, um...

04:04.786 --> 04:07.538
You try an old one every once in a while.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.958
-Uh, okay.
-I'm sorry.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.044
I'm just really stressed
right now because I have...

04:13.127 --> 04:15.171
I have a meeting
with the Infinity Team later,

04:15.255 --> 04:17.590
I have to get in the right headspace.

04:17.674 --> 04:21.135
I'm so proud of how hard you're working
for this deal.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.930
I wish I was finished
with contract classes so I could help.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.558
Yeah, I think it's best
if you stay out of it.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.935
I was joking.

04:29.018 --> 04:29.852
Oh.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.773
But maybe we can grab dinner later
before I have to study?

04:33.856 --> 04:35.400
-Yeah, sure. Mm-hm.
-Yeah?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.403
-I'll see you.
-See you.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.366
Good morning.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.829
How long have you been lurking?

04:47.912 --> 04:50.748
I'm not lurking. I just got here. For you.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.711
Good news.
Blaine is almost ready to close.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.712
Mm.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.589
We still have a personal question
on the table.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.260
I told you I wanted to be with you.
You had a boyfriend,

05:02.343 --> 05:06.347
and then we slept together,
and since then, you've been avoiding me.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.724
Yeah. I'm sorry.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.393
No, I get it. You got a lot on your plate.

05:10.476 --> 05:14.230
But we are gonna need to have a real talk.
Sometime soon, okay?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.274
All right.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.704
-Oh. Hi. I thought you'd be at work.
-I thought you'd be home hours ago.

05:29.787 --> 05:34.125
I'm sorry. The shoot went late,
and then we had to go to a work party.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.085
You and Oliver?

05:36.169 --> 05:39.339
Yes. Because he's the photographer.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.425
And trust me,
it was more "work" than "party."

05:42.508 --> 05:45.011
Like your hospital cocktail thingy
tomorrow night.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.721
I'm glad you hadn't forgotten.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.640
Of course not.
I'll be there with bells on.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.769
-Well, maybe skip the literal bells.
-Your loss.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.479
Oh.

05:55.563 --> 06:00.026
Oliver is coming over with outfits
for tonight's shoot. I hope that's okay.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.529
Yeah, it's fine.
I'm not trying to derail your career.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.200
Hey. I came as soon as I could.
What's wrong?

06:07.283 --> 06:12.205
Well, my assistant, Amir, was going over
our SEC disclosure information--

06:12.288 --> 06:13.664
Say hi, Amir.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.960
--and he found a private photo
that I e-mailed to Liam from work.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.005
So I need you to scrub our servers
so nobody else,

06:21.089 --> 06:23.966
you know, runs into that
before my IPO launch.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.219
What? That's the emergency?

06:26.302 --> 06:29.555
-Don't you have an IT team?
-Yes, but I'm the boss.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.058
I don't want anyone else to see it.
Plus, you're my cousin.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.768
You've already seen me naked.

06:33.851 --> 06:37.688
Don't worry, it's before we knew
we were cousins. So it's okay.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.190
Will you help me?

06:39.690 --> 06:42.235
Sure, because I got nothing else to do.

06:48.324 --> 06:53.037
Hello, and welcome to your future
with Fallon Unlimited.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.958
We are one of the world's
leading media companies,

06:57.041 --> 06:58.584
and we are only getting brighter

06:58.668 --> 07:02.755
with a board of directors
filled with stars.

07:03.881 --> 07:04.715
Fallon?

07:05.466 --> 07:09.303
I'm sorry. I'm just practicing
my pitch ahead of the IPO roadshow.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.597
Yeah. Does it have to be right now?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.432
Well, I wanted you to hear it

07:13.516 --> 07:18.438
before I officially offer you a seat
on our board of directors.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.857
Amir, is it? Could you turn that off?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.608
I feel a migraine coming on.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.278
Though that may not be
from the light show.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.951
Listen, with all the hype surrounding
the IPO launch, everybody wants a seat.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.037
It's like musical chairs with benefits.
Round and round we go.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.457
-Are you done with this metaphor?
-For the moment.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.878
The point is, I need somebody
on this board who I can trust,

07:41.961 --> 07:46.591
who represents a different industry,
and who brings great PR.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.800
That is Jeff Colby.

07:47.884 --> 07:52.054
You do not want to be the
last one standing when the music stops.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.974
-Okay. Now I'm done.
-Thank you, but not interested.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.894
Okay. Okay. Hardball. I like it.

07:57.977 --> 08:02.356
That's exactly the type of strength
I am looking for in a board member.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.025
You never give up.

08:04.108 --> 08:07.153
Like in high school when
you convinced me to audition for that play

08:07.236 --> 08:08.696
even though I kept saying no.

08:08.779 --> 08:09.906
Aw.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.658
<i>Little Shop of Horrors.</i>
I was so great as Audrey.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.578
And you killed it too,
if I remember correctly.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.371
I was puppeteering the plant!

08:17.455 --> 08:19.874
Look, Fallon, I'm flattered by the offer,

08:19.957 --> 08:22.793
but I'm trying to find
my own next big thing

08:22.877 --> 08:24.378
and this isn't it.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.965
Okay. Agree to disagree for now.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.885
[ominous music playing]

08:30.968 --> 08:32.428
What's that face? What's wrong?

08:32.970 --> 08:35.139
Um, you need to see this.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.350
I know it's not a naked photo of me,

08:37.433 --> 08:39.393
I made that up just to get you here.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.312
It looks like a cyber-attack

08:41.395 --> 08:44.774
has been siphoning your company's
financial information and e-mails.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.777
-Like internal correspondence?
-Customer data too.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.238
Oh, no.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.866
If this leaks, our stock will tank
before it hits the market.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.576
Somebody needs to fix this.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.328
By somebody, I mean you and me.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.288
When you say "you and me," you mean me?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.165
Exactly. Yes.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.418
I hope this doesn't affect
your decision to join the board.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.420
One problem at a time.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.840
[theme music playing]

09:31.279 --> 09:33.906
Where are we going to
create these memories?

09:33.990 --> 09:36.367
First stop, France.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.994
But that's all I'll say.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.747
Unlike with the car,
you're not flying the plane.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.792
That's a shame.
I took flying lessons when I was younger.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.754
You do know that at some point,
I have to go back to work.

09:48.838 --> 09:52.008
There are some advantages
to being father of the boss.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.719
Don't worry, you'll be free soon.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.306
But for now,
let's just enjoy being together.

10:00.516 --> 10:04.395
Okay, I put a patch on the source code
of your security software

10:04.478 --> 10:06.689
-so the hackers can't get back in.
-Great.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.609
It'll hold,
but you need to contact the FBI

10:09.692 --> 10:12.236
and hire a cyber-security firm
to catch whoever did this.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.865
Less great. Do you know
what new investors don't like to hear?

10:15.948 --> 10:19.076
"The FBI has been called in
due to a major security breach."

10:19.160 --> 10:22.663
No FBI, no outside firms
until after the IPO.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.998
Can't you just do it?

10:24.081 --> 10:26.334
When I said I was looking
for my next big thing,

10:26.417 --> 10:28.044
I didn't mean becoming your IT guy.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.505
Well, you can't abandon me now. Please.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.637
Okay. Well, I can't pinpoint
where the hack originated,

10:37.720 --> 10:40.222
but this is definitely an internal breach.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.434
Anyone working here have, uh,
issues with you?

10:43.517 --> 10:46.979
No. Of course not,
I mean, my employees are like family.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.901
I'll make a list.
You get me a polygraph machine.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.779
Everything is going smoothly, Alexis.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.572
It's time to turn it up a notch.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.991
Speak of the devil. Gotta go.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.743
You must be Adam.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.745
Good day. I'm Oliver.

11:02.828 --> 11:03.704
Ah.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.877
Wonderful to meet you. Where's Kirby?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.171
Trying on the clothes I brought over.

11:12.254 --> 11:15.216
Is it normal for a photographer
to come to the model's house?

11:15.299 --> 11:16.384
Not really.

11:16.467 --> 11:20.596
Kirby's special. We work
so well together because of our history.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.306
It's natural chemistry.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.892
We can talk without speaking.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.771
-Mm. You and I should try that.
-Kirby didn't tell me how funny you are.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.898
You should come by the shoot.

11:30.981 --> 11:31.816
Like at 11?

11:31.899 --> 11:34.568
You can catch her in action.
She's phenomenal.

-[footsteps approaching]
-Speaking of phenomenal...

11:37.571 --> 11:38.823
Oh.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.575
-What are you doing home?
-I brought you food.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.953
I forgot you had a fitting.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.418
Is a name I thought I'd never hear again.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.462
Attached to a face
I hoped I'd never see again.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.506
Hey, Joe. So nice to see you.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.300
I was just about to leave.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.177
The country, hopefully.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.221
You have no idea.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.269
I should leave.
I have to prepare for this meet-and-greet.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.645
After you.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.439
Olly.

12:13.023 --> 12:16.026
[pensive music playing]

12:20.072 --> 12:22.199
This is the most beautiful thing
I've seen.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.118
I see something more beautiful.

12:24.201 --> 12:29.748
How did you finagle a private meal
after hours at the Louvre?

12:31.125 --> 12:33.043
A woman never tells her secrets.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.591
You two have the same mischievous smile.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.760
I will always remember this moment.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.304
Exactly the point.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.057
I can't believe
I've only been here once before.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.684
I've really been missing out.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.103
How come you're not eating?
This food is amazing.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.396
I can't. My...

12:53.439 --> 12:55.524
My stomach is doing backflips.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.068
Look, we need to talk.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.447
-The other night, I--
-[cell phone buzzing]

13:05.784 --> 13:07.536
-What?
-What's wrong?

13:07.620 --> 13:08.579
It's Fletch--

13:08.662 --> 13:11.332
Um, my contact at the Infinity Team.

13:11.415 --> 13:15.336
The deal's about to get torpedoed,
he wants to discuss strategy.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.421
This is supposed to be our night--

13:17.505 --> 13:20.007
No, go, go, go.
You're so close to the finish line.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.134
Thank you.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.219
[Oliver] Great.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.180
[dance music playing]

13:26.263 --> 13:28.390
Can you give me a bit more attitude?

13:28.474 --> 13:31.477
Think about the time
we were going to a nightclub,

13:31.560 --> 13:32.895
and I never showed up.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.648
There it is.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.526
Perfect. Yes.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.200
Okay.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.161
We need to make a few adjustments.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.996
-[Kirby] What?
-Nisha wants this to feel like

13:51.080 --> 13:54.792
an industrial take on <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>
Crazy, sexy, romantic.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.461
You're great. He's not exactly Heathcliff.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.796
Okay, watch.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.800
I want it to look like you two
are actually in love.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.593
Put your hand on my shoulder.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.012
And you, don't be so delicate with her.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.014
-Grab her thigh.
-[Kirby] Ooh. [giggles]

14:09.098 --> 14:12.560
I haven't read <i>Wuthering Heights,</i>
but clearly I'm going to.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.231
-What was that?
-Nothing.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.651
Everything's perfect.
Let's get back to it.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.696
Yes. That's what I'm talking about.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.991
Look at each other.
You're in love. In love. Beautiful.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.203
[intercom beeps]

14:31.287 --> 14:34.915
[pilot] <i>We'll be on the ground in Atlanta</i>
<i>in 15 minutes.</i>

14:35.749 --> 14:37.459
I had a wonderful trip.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.919
Why are you crying?

14:40.212 --> 14:41.088
I just...

14:41.922 --> 14:44.550
I wish I could freeze this moment in time.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.803
Well, we're not done
making memories, right?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.138
Not even close.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.933
I have a long list of things still to do.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.103
Well, we don't have to make all
of our new memories in just two days.

14:57.187 --> 15:01.442
I feel guilty that I spent the night
in Paris when Fallon needs me here.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.611
-I should go in.
-Of course.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.572
It's just...

15:08.115 --> 15:10.159
we screwed up so much last year.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.578
We got married in jail.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.122
We broke our vows to each other.

15:16.373 --> 15:20.252
It's important to me that we replace
those bad memories with new ones.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.922
We will. For the rest of our lives.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.382
There's no need to rush.

15:25.883 --> 15:26.800
Right.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.095
Thank you for the information.

15:30.846 --> 15:31.972
Kirby.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.683
Before you say anything,
I'd like to point out

15:34.767 --> 15:38.062
-that Oliver and I are not dating again.
-That's a relief.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.355
He's a photographer.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.357
I'm very proud of how hard you're working.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.984
-Then why are you yelling?
-I haven't raised my voice.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.070
You're thinking in a loud voice.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.529
That's just your imagination.

15:48.530 --> 15:52.785
However, if I were to say something
I was thinking, it would probably be

15:52.868 --> 15:56.080
that I found out Oliver left his job
to come here.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.623
So? He got offered a better one.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.500
But he didn't complete his job first.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.419
He moved out without notice,
leaving his furniture.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.631
-Why the hurry?
-I don't know, and I don't care.

16:05.714 --> 16:09.468
You should care about how much time
you're spending with someone

16:09.551 --> 16:11.762
who led you down a bad path before.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.263
Again, I'm not saying anything.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.516
I'm just thinking.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.604
-Is your name Tessa?
-Yes.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.690
You've worked at the company
for six months?

16:22.773 --> 16:23.691
Yes.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.527
Why are you intent
on destroying my company?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.237
That's not a yes or no question.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.697
That's not an answer.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.157
Do you have unresolved issues with me?

16:32.866 --> 16:33.993
No.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.036
No, I don't think so.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.329
Did you betray me?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.750
What are you talking about?
Why am I wearing these?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.253
You called me in
to review the hacked financials.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.630
Oh, I did. But this sounded more fun.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.758
Also, there are questions about
my childhood that I need answered.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.885
So you might want to settle in.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.057
[knocking on door]

17:02.146 --> 17:05.399
I can't wait to see the proofs!
I'm so excited!

17:05.983 --> 17:08.944
The SD card in my camera was corrupted
and pictures were deleted.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.822
What? All of them?

17:11.905 --> 17:14.158
No, I have the first third.
I can just send those.

17:14.241 --> 17:17.327
No. I hadn't warmed up yet.
You said I was too stiff.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.663
You can't send any of those
to the head of the company.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.373
We could do a quick reshoot.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.752
Now? I'm supposed to go
to Adam's thing in an hour.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.211
The pictures are fine.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.506
Fine isn't good enough for Nisha.
You said she's a perfectionist.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.176
-Can we go back to set?
-What about Adam?

17:32.259 --> 17:35.262
I'll just be a little late.
He'll understand.

17:35.345 --> 17:38.766
-[Sam] Everything is terrible.
-This sandwich is great.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.725
Really?

17:40.350 --> 17:43.395
That's a relief.
I just added it to the menu, and--

17:43.479 --> 17:45.856
What? Can we please talk about
the sandwich later?

17:45.939 --> 17:47.107
Sure if we have to.

17:47.691 --> 17:52.237
Last night Fletcher told me that Blaine
thinks that I'm a pushover,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.824
and he's going to strong-arm me
into giving him a bigger cut

17:55.908 --> 17:56.909
or he's going to walk.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.619
What kind of name is Blaine?

17:59.828 --> 18:00.871
Wait, go back.

18:01.538 --> 18:02.956
You were with Fletcher?

18:03.040 --> 18:06.001
The same Fletcher
that you told me you slept with?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.338
I wasn't "with him" with him.
It was a work emergency.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.964
You still haven't told Ryan you cheated?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.050
Does that mean you chose Fletcher?

18:13.133 --> 18:16.095
Ryan has midterms,
and I don't want to upset him.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.389
And I haven't chosen anyone.
But that's not what we're talking about!

18:19.473 --> 18:21.100
Right. Blaine. [clears throat]

18:21.600 --> 18:24.186
This guy probably thinks
he can trample on your deal

18:24.269 --> 18:27.648
because you're new at this,
and he's got a team of experts.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.859
So, what if I go with you
to your next meeting?

18:31.360 --> 18:32.486
I can be your crew.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.113
Do two people make a crew?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.532
They do when it's the two of us.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.118
I can be there as your silent partner.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.454
So, what do we know about this Blaine guy?

18:42.538 --> 18:45.624
Well, he's gay,
and he once asked Fletcher out,

18:45.707 --> 18:47.543
which is not that helpful.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.963
But he also likes to bluff.

18:51.046 --> 18:54.675
Though, sometimes it can seem like
he's bluffing, but he's not.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.426
That's why it's called a bluff.

18:57.344 --> 19:00.180
Oof. It is a good thing I'm coming.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.977
Good news, the hackers didn't
get any financial information

19:05.060 --> 19:07.604
-that could hurt you.
-And the bad news?

19:07.688 --> 19:09.857
This company spends a fortune
on air travel.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.068
Really? That's what we're talking
about after a giant hack

19:13.152 --> 19:16.113
that could expose our customers
to identity theft?

19:16.196 --> 19:20.284
Yes. If the amount got out, it would be
a publicity nightmare before the IPO.

19:20.367 --> 19:24.788
Investors hate exorbitant expenses.
They want a lean company.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.791
Sometimes I need to get
from one place to another,

19:27.875 --> 19:29.751
and that will never be flying commercial.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.213
Which is why we should invest
in a private airline.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.675
We've got other things to worry about,
but you should do that when you're ready.

19:36.758 --> 19:40.012
Let's put that on the backburner
until after the IPO.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.682
Did, uh,
anyone fail the lie detector test?

19:43.765 --> 19:47.352
Only you when you said you were too busy
to come to my 5th birthday party.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.771
-But not everybody has taken it.
-Hey. Whoa!

19:49.855 --> 19:52.774
I'm so sorry, sir. Let me clean that up.

19:54.943 --> 19:55.819
How'd that guy do?

19:55.903 --> 19:58.155
He hasn't taken it.
He's been here five minutes.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.324
How could he have a grudge already?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.826
It's four minutes longer than needed.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.623
Um, Amir,
after you're done cleaning that up,

20:07.706 --> 20:10.626
what do you say we hook you up
to that polygraph?

20:10.709 --> 20:15.672
Oh, yeah, sure. I just have to pick up
my grandmother at the airport.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.675
That wasn't suspicious at all.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.219
How could he betray me?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.930
Like I said,
four minutes longer than needed.

20:23.013 --> 20:23.847
That's cute.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.308
I just need to get an extra laptop

20:26.391 --> 20:30.229
and wire up some hidden security cameras
to send me a direct feed,

20:30.312 --> 20:33.273
and we can solve this problem
once and for all.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.942
Do you know how to do any of that?

20:35.025 --> 20:38.487
No. But I know somebody
who'll be thrilled to do it.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.948
You'll have to put your pettiness aside.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.706
There's no way we can do this without him?

20:49.790 --> 20:52.751
-Or in the morning?
-Jeff isn't going anywhere.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.754
-What, is it past your bedtime?
-It's the jet lag.

20:55.837 --> 20:59.633
Oh, that's right.
I forgot you gallivanted off to Paris.

20:59.716 --> 21:02.678
Cristal may have gone overboard
in our adventuring,

21:02.761 --> 21:05.264
but she wants us to make up
for our mistakes.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.057
When you slept with my mother-in-law.

21:07.140 --> 21:11.019
So unless you're starting from scratch,
you will always have that history.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.980
Maybe we do need to start over.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.774
I'm gonna take care of something,

21:15.857 --> 21:18.360
plus I would rather not be
in the same room with the man

21:18.443 --> 21:20.362
that tried to ruin my life.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.239
Yeah. Great to see you too.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.743
Feels nice to be able to breathe
clean air again.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.288
Come on over. Picture's up.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.751
How did you get Amir
to go into the office after hours?

21:34.835 --> 21:37.796
I told him he had to wait
for an overseas delivery.

21:37.879 --> 21:42.592
I also casually mentioned that I made
a small change to my IPO presentation

21:42.676 --> 21:45.429
that involved some news
for investors only.

21:45.512 --> 21:49.099
So if he's the hacker, he will not be able
to resist going through my computer,

21:49.182 --> 21:51.059
which I conveniently left on my desk.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.770
This sounds like an analog solution
to a digital problem.

21:53.854 --> 21:57.274
Okay. But I've decided it's not Amir.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.900
Look, he loves his job.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.737
He even painted my toenails
when my pedicurist canceled.

22:01.820 --> 22:05.574
He might have a tiny crush on me,
which could get uncomfortable.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.785
The only thing uncomfortable
is the image of that guy

22:08.869 --> 22:10.829
being forced to paint your toenails.

22:10.912 --> 22:14.333
He doesn't have a crush.
He's nice because you pay him.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.251
I still don't think it's him.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.795
He majored in computer science at MIT.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.674
He easily has the technical know-how
to pull this off.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.260
Oh, and look what he's doing right now.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.388
Oh, that can't be good.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.681
Sixty-forty?

22:29.765 --> 22:33.310
That's not what we agreed on.
It was an even fifty-fifty.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.728
That was the starting point.

22:34.811 --> 22:35.979
We've reconsidered.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.442
If you don't like the terms,
we have no problem walking away.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.451
We'll make it sixty-forty.

22:49.993 --> 22:53.997
But La Mirage takes the extra 10%
or we walk.

22:54.081 --> 22:57.709
Does your silent partner not understand
how negotiating works?

22:57.793 --> 22:58.919
[Sam] He does.

22:59.002 --> 23:02.005
Because he understands that
the hotel is the one with the name,

23:02.089 --> 23:04.758
the reputation and the client base.

23:04.841 --> 23:08.220
There are a hundred groups like you,
but there's only one of us.

23:08.303 --> 23:11.306
[pensive music playing]

23:12.182 --> 23:13.016
Okay.

23:13.934 --> 23:18.355
Fifty-fifty, but a three-year contract.
Guaranteed.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.815
Two-year contract.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.192
We get free rooms whenever we want.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.158
Free room for you for two weeks a year.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.494
Free access to the club for everyone else.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.453
Deal.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.456
I'll have my guys draw up the paperwork

23:36.540 --> 23:38.583
and bring them to us to sign.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.670
Where? Can't we just do it here?

23:41.753 --> 23:45.298
No. I always like to hit a club
to sign and celebrate a deal.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.217
Fletch? You up for that?

23:48.009 --> 23:49.386
Sounds good.

23:49.469 --> 23:52.848
Count me out.
All this negotiating has gotten me tired.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.644
Sam, a word.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.148
You shouldn't go out with Fletcher
again before you talk to Ryan.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.860
I can't talk to Ryan tonight
because he's studying.

24:04.943 --> 24:09.239
You heard Blaine. We have to go
to the club, sign and celebrate there.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.866
It's his thing.

24:10.949 --> 24:14.244
Blaine will be there the whole time.
We'll be fine.

24:14.327 --> 24:18.123
Okay?
I will call Ryan first thing tomorrow.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.000
I promise.

24:23.170 --> 24:27.549
This is the most boring episode of
<i>To Catch a Hacker</i> I have ever seen.

24:27.632 --> 24:32.846
I mean, FaceTiming his friend in Japan
to complain about traffic at the airport?

24:32.929 --> 24:35.640
I guess he really was picking up
his grandmother.

24:35.724 --> 24:36.892
[Fallon] Turn up the volume.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.310
<i>The package still isn't here.</i>

24:38.393 --> 24:40.228
<i>I feel like she made a mistake.</i>

24:41.438 --> 24:42.689
<i>Oh, I don't think so.</i>

24:44.065 --> 24:46.067
<i>Because she's somewhat terrifying.</i>

24:46.151 --> 24:47.819
I don't think he's talking about me.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.530
<i>The last thing I'm doing is calling her.</i>

24:50.614 --> 24:52.616
<i>She wanted me to take a lie detector test.</i>

24:52.699 --> 24:54.367
<i>I had to run out of there.</i>

24:54.451 --> 24:56.953
<i>And I'm also stealing office supplies.</i>

24:57.037 --> 24:59.873
[gasps] How dare he?

24:59.956 --> 25:02.209
<i>It's the least I deserve</i>
<i>after that pedicure.</i>

25:02.292 --> 25:05.212
I'm shocked he didn't love
painting your toenails.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.755
Well, I don't care.

25:06.838 --> 25:10.342
Yeah, I'm tough on my employees.
It makes them tougher out in the world.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.845
This is just like your group
of girlfriends in high school.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.806
They didn't like doing half the things
you told them to either.

25:16.890 --> 25:21.269
Okay, that's the second time
you brought up high school in two days.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.021
-Do you have an issue?
-[computer beeps]

25:24.189 --> 25:26.942
Wait, hold on. The servers are lit up.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.820
There's hacking going on right now.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.406
I took the patch off
to try and catch Amir in the act.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.575
[gasps] I always knew it was him.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.452
Except it's not.

25:37.535 --> 25:40.997
I set up a trace
and the signal's pinging all over.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.874
Russia, China, Ukraine.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.001
These guys are good.

25:45.085 --> 25:49.673
I guess my analog solution actually
helped us eliminate the paperclip thief.

25:49.756 --> 25:53.343
The question is, if it's not him,
then who is it?

26:00.141 --> 26:02.102
I thought about what you said

26:02.185 --> 26:04.896
about the cruel things
we did to each other.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.982
Then Fallon said something interesting.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.192
She said that
we couldn't start over again.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.320
-But she's wrong. We can.
-What do you mean?

26:12.404 --> 26:14.281
And what's in that box?

26:16.157 --> 26:17.951
Well, this is our new beginning.

26:18.034 --> 26:21.746
We got married in jail,
that wasn't the best place to start.

26:21.830 --> 26:26.501
So I had your personal shopper
pick this up and deliver it right away.

26:28.712 --> 26:32.841
How would you like to renew our vows?

26:32.924 --> 26:35.552
Create new memories together
starting today?

26:38.054 --> 26:40.015
Can't you do this any faster?

26:40.598 --> 26:44.227
Things would go faster
if you'd stop bossing me around. Okay?

26:44.311 --> 26:48.231
You want me to paint your toenails?
Play an evil plant? Fix your hair?

26:48.315 --> 26:50.275
Look, what is wrong with my hair?

26:50.358 --> 26:53.153
And more importantly,
what is wrong with you?

26:53.236 --> 26:55.113
Why do you keep talking about high school

26:55.196 --> 26:58.867
like it was some terrible experience?
We were friends.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.618
[sighs]

27:00.702 --> 27:04.873
Weren't we? Or were you just scared of me
like you think everyone else was?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.084
We were friends.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.670
But there were some conditions.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.297
I wasn't scared of you.

27:12.380 --> 27:15.884
But I was scared of losing
the Carrington scholarship if I upset you.

27:15.967 --> 27:19.554
Hold on. I never treated you
like a scholarship kid.

27:19.637 --> 27:21.973
-We didn't even talk about it.
-We didn't have to.

27:22.057 --> 27:25.143
We both knew I was only there
because of your family.

27:25.226 --> 27:28.646
So I ended up in that play just so you
wouldn't complain to Blake about it.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.565
I missed coding camp.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.318
Okay,
you should probably thank me for that.

27:33.401 --> 27:36.154
But why are you bringing this up now?

27:36.237 --> 27:40.200
Because you are still trying to get
everyone to do what you want.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.951
Your employees are terrified of you.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.828
And I'm a little sensitive

27:43.912 --> 27:47.290
when it comes to you trying to
manipulate me into taking a board seat.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.334
So you think I'm a mean girl?

27:49.918 --> 27:51.544
Well, don't worry.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.714
I don't want somebody on my board
who's so sensitive.

27:54.798 --> 27:57.425
I already said no three times.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.969
You know what? I'm done.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.721
So good luck stopping the hackers

28:01.805 --> 28:04.391
before they release
all your private information to the world.

28:04.474 --> 28:07.602
[dramatic music playing]

28:12.065 --> 28:13.066
[door closes]

28:13.691 --> 28:15.527
How nice of you to stop by.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.738
Before you get angry...

28:19.614 --> 28:21.825
Right, you're already angry.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.286
I'm sorry I missed the meet and greet

28:25.370 --> 28:27.622
but something happened to the files

28:27.705 --> 28:29.332
and we had to do a reshoot.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.959
-I didn't have a choice.
-You did.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.211
You knew how important that was to me.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.927
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

28:42.053 --> 28:44.806
Kirby, come on.
I know the signs of drug abuse.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.141
What are you talking about?

28:46.224 --> 28:49.811
The shaky hands,
the dilated pupils, that dewy glow.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.688
You got the coke sweats.

28:51.771 --> 28:54.315
And your pulse is racing.
Oliver's feeding you drugs now?

28:54.399 --> 28:55.608
How much did you do?

28:55.692 --> 28:59.154
Just enough to keep up my energy
for my work.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.365
It's not my fault.
The files were corrupted.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.744
You never considered he arranged that
to spend more time with you?

29:05.827 --> 29:07.746
The guy couldn't keep his hands off you.

29:07.829 --> 29:10.039
-What? When?
-Last night.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.124
I came by your shoot.

29:11.207 --> 29:13.251
-You were spying on me?
-No. He invited me.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.962
So you just came and watched
and just left?

29:16.045 --> 29:19.549
I didn't want to make a scene but maybe
I should have. He has other intentions.

29:19.632 --> 29:22.469
-I asked you to trust me.
-And I'm trying.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.388
But this modeling thing changed you.
You're out of control.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.265
I'm doing what I have to for my career.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.642
Doing coke and a catalog shoot
is not a career.

29:29.726 --> 29:30.852
Screw you.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.772
[tea kettle whistling]

29:36.065 --> 29:37.025
Ah.

29:37.650 --> 29:40.987
Hello, Joe. I just got done photographing
your daughter.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.949
Did you pop by to see the pictures
or are you moonlighting as housekeeping?

29:45.033 --> 29:48.661
I don't know what you're doing here,
but I don't like you near my daughter.

29:48.745 --> 29:51.581
Last time,
you almost killed yourself and her.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.500
So why are you here?

29:53.583 --> 29:56.461
I got a job,
and I ran into Kirby at the hotel.

29:56.544 --> 29:59.088
She might believe that story, but I don't.

29:59.172 --> 30:02.175
My sources in Australia
tell me you left in a hurry.

30:02.258 --> 30:03.593
Job was too good to pass up.

30:03.676 --> 30:04.886
Yeah, seems so.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.264
Your bank account seems to be a lot fuller

30:08.348 --> 30:10.558
than it should be
for just taking a few pictures.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.602
Keep the hell out of my bank account.

30:16.564 --> 30:17.690
Be careful.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.527
That is one way to get your nose broken.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.695
I will figure out why you're here.

30:23.571 --> 30:25.490
I want you out of Atlanta. Permanently.

30:25.573 --> 30:26.908
How much will it take?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.202
I don't think you can afford that.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.578
-Try me.
-Here's the thing,

30:30.662 --> 30:34.207
I already have a patron,
and she pays me handsomely.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.751
I'm not looking for another.

-This isn't over.

You think you're working hard,
but if you do not fix this hack,

30:55.854 --> 30:57.605
then I'm gonna come to the office,

30:57.689 --> 31:01.693
and trust me, you do not want me
coming to the office.

31:01.776 --> 31:04.863

I'm not trying to threaten you.
I know you're doing the best you can.

31:08.157 --> 31:10.869
I just need you to do it a little faster.
Okay?

31:11.452 --> 31:12.287
Thank you.

31:17.292 --> 31:21.713
Cristal, I've never experienced love
like the one we have,

31:23.423 --> 31:25.758
I promise to love and cherish you

31:25.842 --> 31:27.802
for the rest of our long lives.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.389
I will do whatever it takes
to make you happy.

31:31.931 --> 31:35.143
From now until we're old and gray,
you have my heart.

31:36.477 --> 31:40.398
Blake, if we had all the time
in the world,

31:41.274 --> 31:43.985
I would spend each and every moment
with you.

31:44.485 --> 31:47.697
And I promise that
I will do whatever it takes,

31:48.781 --> 31:52.368
to sacrifice whatever I have to,
to keep our love alive.

Blaine wanted to go to.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.383
Never been to a strip club?

32:07.467 --> 32:09.469
Oh, no. I have, a few times.

Y'all ready to have some fun tonight?

How about a dance for the guy that brought
La Mirage and the Infinity Team together?

32:58.726 --> 33:00.228
Yeah? Mm-hm?

33:00.311 --> 33:02.021
We should get another guy.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.774
This one looks like he's not feeling well.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.067
He looks fine to me.

Yeah. Everything's fine. Oops.

I'm so sorry for my friend.
He's just a little nervous.

-Let me.
-Oh, okay.

Ryan, stop. Stop!

and I swear I was going to, but I didn't.

as watching my current boyfriend

34:10.423 --> 34:11.549
Between us?

34:11.632 --> 34:15.011
Clearly he doesn't understand
the photographer-model relationship.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.637
He thinks you're a bad influence.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.306
Would a bad influence tell you

34:18.389 --> 34:20.725
that he heard back from Nisha Lockhart

34:21.893 --> 34:24.854
and that she loved the pictures
from the reshoot?

34:24.937 --> 34:27.398
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Thank you.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.610
-Thank you so much for all of this.
-I'm here for you.

34:30.693 --> 34:32.945
Forget about Adam
if he's gonna bring you down.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.323
Ride this momentum. We should celebrate.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.325
Oh, I know one way to celebrate.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.620
Do you have anymore?

34:41.704 --> 34:44.332
-Are you sure?
-We've done a little for work.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.709
Now we deserve a little for some fun.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.378
Nisha's happy, so I'm happy.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.547
We may have made
some bad decisions last time,

34:51.631 --> 34:55.259
but it's not going to be like that again.
We know better now, right?

35:00.932 --> 35:02.850
Hey. Thanks for agreeing to see me.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.228
I was hoping we could finish that meal.

35:05.311 --> 35:09.524
Though, it would be more breakfast
than dinner, but you get the point.

35:09.607 --> 35:13.361
-I'm just a little nervous.
-Yeah, sorry. I can't stay.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.197
Look, I get it. Okay. I do.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.116
I have to apologize.

35:18.199 --> 35:19.075
I...

35:19.158 --> 35:23.287
I thought I was making some sort of
decision between you and Fletcher.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.789
Then I saw you in the same room

35:24.872 --> 35:27.708
and I realized that
it's you that I want, Ryan.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.961
Plain and simple.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.712
Thank you for saying that.

35:31.796 --> 35:35.174
And I know that I may have
screwed things up too much.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.803
Making you move your whole life
to Atlanta, then doing this,

35:38.886 --> 35:40.138
but I want you.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.641
I... Maybe you can just forgive me.

35:44.642 --> 35:45.518
One day.

35:47.478 --> 35:50.398
What if that day is today?

35:50.481 --> 35:53.025
[pensive music playing]

35:53.109 --> 35:56.612
Look, I'm not saying
it's okay you cheated.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.657
But I played a part in this too.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.743
I've been so busy with school
and with work

36:02.827 --> 36:05.329
that I haven't been giving you
enough time.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.541
If I hadn't been called
to fill in last night,

36:08.624 --> 36:11.460
I wouldn't even know
there was something wrong between us.

36:12.712 --> 36:16.132
I haven't been paying attention to you.

36:16.215 --> 36:18.217
Or... Or to us.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.302
It's not your fault.

36:19.385 --> 36:21.762
Oh, I know.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.640
But it's not all your fault.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.310
And I chose to move here.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.980
And I love my law school. So I'm staying.

36:31.731 --> 36:32.565
With me?

36:33.900 --> 36:34.734
Sam, um...

36:36.986 --> 36:42.116
I... I think that we both know
that the timing is wrong.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.620
You're busy with your hotel.
I'm busy with school.

36:45.703 --> 36:49.498
Maybe, who knows, one day in the future...

36:50.416 --> 36:52.960
the stars will align
a little better for us.

36:58.841 --> 36:59.717
Yeah.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.220
Who knows?

37:05.097 --> 37:05.973
Okay.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.562
I'll see you around, okay?

37:12.313 --> 37:15.316
[melancholy music playing]

37:16.817 --> 37:20.571
I've reviewed your charts multiple times.
What else do you want?

37:20.655 --> 37:24.325
I want you to find a new option
that doesn't involve dying.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.661
You said surgery was a possibility.

37:26.744 --> 37:30.164
The only way we can go through with
surgery is if we shrink the tumor first.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.874
And we're not having any luck.

37:31.958 --> 37:36.295
Maybe there's some kind of
experimental drug or a clinical trial.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.714
-There's no guarantees.
-I don't need a guarantee.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.508
I just need a chance.

37:40.591 --> 37:44.595
I vowed to Blake to do everything
in my power to keep our love alive.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.348
I need you to help me do that.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.270
Well, how'd it go?

37:52.853 --> 37:55.564
Papers get signed? Everything go smoothly?

37:55.648 --> 37:59.068
Well, if by smoothly,
you mean going to a strip club

37:59.151 --> 38:01.696
where my boyfriend was about to give
my ex a lap dance

38:01.779 --> 38:08.494
until I blurted out that I slept with that
ex-boyfriend then, yeah, pretty smooth.

38:08.577 --> 38:10.871
And then you signed the papers.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.206
The deal is dead.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.710
Blaine fired Fletcher for not disclosing
that we had a prior relationship,

38:15.793 --> 38:18.045
and now Fletcher won't speak to me.

38:18.129 --> 38:21.299
Which is fine, because I realized
that I only want to be with Ryan.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.509
-Great!
-Who just broke up with me.

38:23.592 --> 38:26.095
Maybe I should leave and come back
so we can start over.

38:26.178 --> 38:27.013
Wait.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.643
It's not your fault that I just spent
the last 16 hours in hell. It's just...

38:33.936 --> 38:39.066
I went from a hot love triangle
and a multimillion-dollar expansion

38:39.150 --> 38:42.445
to being single again
with no business plan.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.739
Actually, I think I can help.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.116
-You're not my type.
-You should be so lucky.

38:47.199 --> 38:50.578
No, I meant as a business partner.
A real one.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.372
I could do the same thing
the Infinity Team was going to do.

38:53.456 --> 38:56.542
We can buy our own club
and come up with an even better plan.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.835
Would you really want to?

38:57.918 --> 39:01.005
I've been looking for
an investment in real estate.

39:01.088 --> 39:05.676
And after seeing the way you negotiated
with Blaine, I was pretty impressed.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.179
And I know that Jeff and Monica want

39:08.262 --> 39:10.389
to unload the Colby Club next door.

39:11.057 --> 39:14.101
Might be a sign.
We could expand the expansion.

39:17.897 --> 39:18.731
I'm in.

39:19.607 --> 39:25.654
I am not sorry for being mean or scary or
for being tough on you or my employees.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.574
If this is your apology,
you should probably stop.

39:28.657 --> 39:30.534
Look at page 26.

39:31.577 --> 39:32.411
Go.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.086
I think I'm having flashbacks.

39:40.169 --> 39:44.006
I am sorry for not having considered
what your life was like then.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.258
Looking at that picture,
it made me realize

39:46.342 --> 39:50.679
that I never put myself in your shoes,
or your plant costume.

39:52.890 --> 39:53.724
Thank you.

39:54.433 --> 39:58.229
I know the Carrington scholarship
must have carried a lot of pressure,

39:58.312 --> 40:02.691
and I'm sorry if you felt like I was
using that pressure to manipulate you.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.444
So I am apologizing,

40:05.528 --> 40:11.117
but not trying to manipulate you
onto my board with that apology.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.911
I like scary Fallon. I always have.

40:14.787 --> 40:16.414
You always go after what you want,

40:16.497 --> 40:18.791
and you know
how to get people to give it to you,

40:18.874 --> 40:22.545
but the board, I just needed you
to respect my boundaries...

40:23.754 --> 40:24.588
as a friend.

40:24.672 --> 40:25.923
I understand.

40:26.006 --> 40:30.344
Our relationship is more important to me
than me getting what I want.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.432
Which doesn't sound like something
I would say, but it is true.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.226
-Friends again?
-We never stopped.

40:37.893 --> 40:38.727
Good.

40:39.562 --> 40:43.691
Because as a friend, I couldn't resist
fixing your hacker problem.

40:44.984 --> 40:47.778
I put a poison pill into your system
before I left.

40:47.862 --> 40:51.574
And when they hacked back in,
it destroyed all the stolen files.

40:52.491 --> 40:56.370
We may never know who the hackers were,
but your information is safe.

40:56.454 --> 41:01.333
Wow. So are we talking, like,
a real pill, or is it...?

41:01.417 --> 41:03.752
Let's just say no, and that'll be that.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.087
Okay.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.549
But it was fun getting back
to my techie roots.

41:09.049 --> 41:11.051
Now it's time to dream big.

41:11.135 --> 41:14.346
And unlike high school, I don't have
to hide in a tree costume anymore.

41:14.430 --> 41:18.976
Mm. Well, it was technically a plant,
but what did you have in mind?

41:19.059 --> 41:21.312
I'll let you know when I figure it out.

41:21.395 --> 41:22.438
Okay.

41:22.521 --> 41:26.400
Hey, in the meantime,
do you want to join my IT team?
