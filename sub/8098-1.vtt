(chanting):
Down with the boys!

01:02.504 --> 01:05.549
Girls rule! Girls are cool!
Down with the boys!

01:05.758 --> 01:09.553
Girls rule! Girls are cool!
Down with the boys!

01:10.763 --> 01:12.598
HENRY:
Singing Soraya.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.436
Sour Susan.

01:17.936 --> 01:19.605
- Guess who?
- Me!

01:20.021 --> 01:24.110
And Moody Margaret,
my number one enemy.

01:24.610 --> 01:26.821
Be honest, no, don't!

01:30.783 --> 01:33.327
- You were going too fast.
- No, l wasn't.

01:33.369 --> 01:37.081
- You were way too slow.
- l don't care!

01:37.163 --> 01:38.666
What's wrong with you?

01:38.706 --> 01:41.669
But l'm deputy head.
This isn't some kind of game.

01:43.671 --> 01:48.634
This is a sophisticated club
and it's my club and l can do what l like.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.762
l'm deputy head as l've already said.

01:51.929 --> 01:53.639
Shouldn't be just like...

01:56.432 --> 01:57.685
Aagh! Enemy attack!

02:03.147 --> 02:04.692
Na-na-na, na na na!

02:04.733 --> 02:06.193
Mission accomplished!

02:08.485 --> 02:10.614
l hate you, Henry!

02:14.952 --> 02:16.328
Henry!

02:18.539 --> 02:19.999
Homework, now!

02:23.668 --> 02:26.714
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

02:31.217 --> 02:34.138
Oh, hi, l'm Henry, and this is my world.

02:34.179 --> 02:37.016
- Firstom, mydad.
- Henry!

02:37.056 --> 02:39.476
He says the same thing to me every day.

02:39.518 --> 02:42.604
Get up those stairs right now
and do your homework

02:42.646 --> 02:45.024
or there'll be no more television for a week.

02:45.064 --> 02:46.734
- Heard it before.
- A month.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.235
- Oh, come on!
- A year.

02:48.277 --> 02:49.653
No way!

02:49.694 --> 02:53.657
Then there's my wormy little brother, Peter,
and his annoying cello.

02:53.698 --> 02:56.160
Hey, Peter. It's not bad...

02:56.993 --> 02:59.371
for a smelly nappy baby.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.540
And then Mum says:

03:01.582 --> 03:03.625
Don't be horrid, Henry!

03:03.667 --> 03:07.546
So then l got to my room and do my homework.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.465
Only joking.

03:09.505 --> 03:12.468
Why'd l want to do my homework?
l'm way too busy.

03:12.508 --> 03:14.470
Wha-ha! Rocking out!

03:14.511 --> 03:17.222
Some day l'm gonna be a rock star.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.766
# Got no time for homework

03:18.807 --> 03:20.392
# Too busy being me

03:20.642 --> 03:22.352
# Singing Zero Zombies

03:22.394 --> 03:24.146
# Eating beans for tea

03:24.313 --> 03:25.856
# Down with wormy worms

03:25.897 --> 03:27.399
# That's what l decree

03:27.441 --> 03:29.067
# l'm the king around here

03:29.109 --> 03:30.569
# The all-time majesty

03:30.777 --> 03:32.446
# They say that l am horrid

03:32.486 --> 03:34.490
# But little do they know

03:34.530 --> 03:35.949
# l'm really, really horrid

03:35.991 --> 03:37.492
# And that's the way it goes

03:37.533 --> 03:39.620
# l'm a hero, l'm a pirate

03:39.661 --> 03:41.121
# Touching close with cool

03:41.163 --> 03:44.416
# A Tyrannosaurus Rex
coming straight at you

03:44.458 --> 03:45.542
# Come on

03:45.583 --> 03:48.170
# Wanna croon it, croon it, croon it

03:48.212 --> 03:49.963
# l just wanna do it

03:50.212 --> 03:51.673
# l just wanna croon it

03:52.174 --> 03:54.843
# Too cool, too cool, for school

03:54.885 --> 03:56.595
# No no no no no

03:56.637 --> 03:58.263
# l'm nobody's fool

03:59.597 --> 04:01.141
# Too cool for school

04:01.474 --> 04:03.060
MUM:

04:03.393 --> 04:06.021
MUM:
Henry! Henry!

04:07.272 --> 04:09.232
l said, get up.

04:09.273 --> 04:10.734
l'm getting up, Mum.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.694
(snoring)

04:12.736 --> 04:14.571
Get up and get dressed!

04:14.612 --> 04:16.656
l'm getting dressed, Mum.

04:16.697 --> 04:18.575
Right. That's it.

04:18.616 --> 04:20.911
You're going to make us all late.

04:20.952 --> 04:23.038
l'm not gonna make us all late, Mum.

04:23.079 --> 04:26.625
l've re-stocked the loo rolls,
cleaned my toothbrush holder,

04:26.665 --> 04:30.629
dusted under the bath
and now l'm going to polish my shoes.

04:31.045 --> 04:32.672
That's a good boy, Peter.

04:37.969 --> 04:39.096
Henry?

04:39.136 --> 04:40.806
Go away, worm!
(farts)

04:40.847 --> 04:42.724
Aagh! Mum!

04:42.765 --> 04:45.894
MUM:
And don't forget your homework!

04:46.894 --> 04:48.647
Henry!

04:49.355 --> 04:51.691
- (miaow)
- Shoo, Fluffy!

05:00.699 --> 05:02.452
Ooh, there it is.

05:02.494 --> 05:04.246
Oh, no!

05:04.286 --> 05:07.874
DAD: Come on, Henry, get your coat on.
It's time for school!

05:07.915 --> 05:09.459
(Fluffy growls)

05:14.171 --> 05:15.632
Hi!

05:16.674 --> 05:18.301
Hey, guys, wait for me!

05:18.969 --> 05:20.804
ALL:
Peter!

05:20.844 --> 05:24.015
Look, those are Peter's little miends.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.185
They love school and l really, really hate school.

05:27.935 --> 05:29.729
Anyway, here goes.

05:31.188 --> 05:32.274
(farting sound)

05:32.314 --> 05:33.400
Eugh!

05:33.441 --> 05:36.611
That's Ralph.
Better known as Rude Ralph.

05:36.653 --> 05:38.905
And that's Aerobic Al.

05:39.738 --> 05:41.241
Brainy Brian.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.451
And Bee_ Bert.

05:43.493 --> 05:45.745
- l dunno.
ALL: l dunno!

05:45.786 --> 05:48.957
With miends like these,
school's not all bad.

05:48.997 --> 05:50.875
(children shouting)

05:54.211 --> 05:58.925
Together, we are The Purple Hand Gang.

06:06.224 --> 06:09.018
Brian, l need a note.
l haven't got my homework.

06:09.059 --> 06:11.062
- So what's new, Henry?
- OK.

06:12.147 --> 06:14.274
MISS BATTLE-AXE:
Quiet in the classroom.

06:15.859 --> 06:18.528
Settle down. Order in the classroom.

06:18.862 --> 06:20.905
- Margaret?
- Here, Miss.

06:21.572 --> 06:22.824
Susan?

06:23.323 --> 06:25.910
Yeah? Oh. Here, Miss Battle-Axe.

06:26.744 --> 06:29.414
- Ralph?
- Here, Miss.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.293
- Al?
- Here, Miss.

06:34.377 --> 06:37.046
- Bert?
- Er...l dunno.

06:38.089 --> 06:39.257
Brian?

06:39.298 --> 06:40.758
Here, Miss.

06:43.178 --> 06:44.596
William?

06:44.636 --> 06:46.639
Oh, Weepy William.

06:46.681 --> 06:48.683
(tearfully):
Here, Miss.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.643
Linda?

06:50.685 --> 06:52.353
Or Lazy Linda.

06:53.271 --> 06:54.981
(laughter)

06:55.023 --> 06:56.983
(sleepily):
Here, Miss.

06:57.024 --> 06:58.276
Henry?

07:02.362 --> 07:03.823
Horrid Henry.

07:03.864 --> 07:05.700
Here, Miss.

07:06.992 --> 07:08.328
Late mark.

07:09.411 --> 07:11.581
Right, get out your homework.

07:24.968 --> 07:26.679
Oh, please, Miss.

07:27.971 --> 07:29.515
What is it, Henry?

07:29.556 --> 07:31.809
l haven't got my homework, Miss.

07:31.851 --> 07:34.645
Why am l not surprised, Henry?

07:34.686 --> 07:36.564
Oh, l've got a note, Miss.

07:43.487 --> 07:45.031
''Dear Miss B.

07:46.324 --> 07:49.869
The cat ate Henry's homework again.

07:49.911 --> 07:51.954
Bad cat.

07:51.996 --> 07:53.790
Signed Henry's mum.''

07:56.124 --> 07:59.378
Something tells me your mother
did not write this note, Henry.

07:59.794 --> 08:02.632
What do you mean, Miss Battle-Axe?

08:02.673 --> 08:06.552
And something tells me you did not write
this note, either, Henry.

08:10.472 --> 08:12.475
How do you spell homework?

08:16.103 --> 08:18.648
H-O-M-E...

08:18.688 --> 08:21.108
Ooh, that's very good, Henry.

08:22.944 --> 08:27.990
The next little bit might be a bit harder,
seeing as you've never done any.

08:28.032 --> 08:29.408
How do you spell work?

08:31.410 --> 08:32.495
W ...

08:35.371 --> 08:36.457
..E...

08:37.499 --> 08:38.793
R-K?

08:39.208 --> 08:41.504
No, no, no, no.

08:41.544 --> 08:43.422
W-O-R-K.

08:43.464 --> 08:45.216
That is how you spell work.

08:45.256 --> 08:48.594
And that's why l know
you did not write this note, Henry.

08:48.636 --> 08:51.931
Because work is spelt correctly in this note

08:51.971 --> 08:55.351
and l know you'd never be able
to spell it correctly.

08:55.393 --> 08:56.727
- Ah.
- (knock on door)

08:56.768 --> 08:58.521
Enter!

08:59.438 --> 09:04.276
Boudicca, l just wanted to remind you
the school inspectors will be here again today

09:04.317 --> 09:07.738
and we don't want any more...
unpleasantness.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.615
Of course not, Miss Oddbod.

09:09.656 --> 09:12.201
(sigh of relie_
Thank you, Boudicca.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.543
Now...

09:21.085 --> 09:22.503
where was l?

09:23.045 --> 09:25.673
Oh, yes. Detention.

09:25.713 --> 09:27.258
(class gasps)

09:27.299 --> 09:30.678
Single detention
for failing to do your homework.

09:30.719 --> 09:31.762
(gasps)

09:31.803 --> 09:35.182
Double detention
for failing to bring in your homework.

09:35.223 --> 09:39.311
And triple detention for getting somebody else
to write this note

09:39.352 --> 09:41.564
on your behalf about your homework.

09:41.604 --> 09:43.607
- But...
- Silence!

09:45.067 --> 09:48.571
H-O-M-E

09:48.611 --> 09:52.241
W-O-R-K.

09:53.284 --> 09:54.660
Homework.

09:54.993 --> 09:59.707
Now...is there anybody else
who failed to bring in their homework?

10:02.543 --> 10:04.003
Good.

10:05.837 --> 10:08.632
# It's not easy being me

10:08.673 --> 10:11.677
# Wash your face and brush your hair

10:11.718 --> 10:14.388
# Nag, nag, nag it's just not fair

10:14.429 --> 10:17.391
# l'm Horrid Henry

10:17.432 --> 10:19.226
# So tell me school

10:19.267 --> 10:20.894
# Cannot rule

10:21.102 --> 10:23.605
# When l'm king l'll do my thing

10:23.647 --> 10:26.442
# And then my life would be so sweet

10:26.483 --> 10:29.528
# l'm Horrid Henry

10:29.737 --> 10:31.405
# Na na na

# The Purple Hand Gang rules OK

# It's not easy being me

10:38.536 --> 10:41.290

10:41.831 --> 10:44.752
# Na na na, it's not fair

10:44.792 --> 10:47.379
# Na na nay, l wasn't there

10:47.420 --> 10:50.215
# Why do l get blamed for everything

10:50.256 --> 10:53.093
# Cos l'm Horrid Henry?

10:53.676 --> 10:55.220
# Na na na

10:55.261 --> 10:56.722
# Na na nay

10:56.763 --> 10:59.475
# The Purple Hand Gang rules OK

10:59.515 --> 11:02.186
# It's not easy being me...

11:02.810 --> 11:04.897
Two secs, guys, l'll let you in.

11:06.607 --> 11:08.358
(hums to hersel_

11:22.789 --> 11:23.916
(knock on door)

11:23.957 --> 11:25.292
Yes?

11:26.209 --> 11:28.754
The school inspectors are here to see you,
Miss Oddbod.

11:29.296 --> 11:31.298
Thank you, Sidmouth.

11:31.339 --> 11:33.133
OK.

11:42.059 --> 11:45.896
Without practice, we won't be ready
for the talent contest.

11:45.936 --> 11:49.066
- But we've no instruments.
- Who needs instruments?

11:49.107 --> 11:50.734
(they imitate guitar riffs)

11:50.775 --> 11:52.694
Come on, Henry, let's rock.

11:52.735 --> 11:54.029
Go Zero Zombies!

11:54.071 --> 11:55.364
ALL: Yeah!

11:55.405 --> 11:57.074
Actually...no.

11:57.114 --> 11:59.201
l haven't got any music.

11:59.241 --> 12:00.535
Allow me...

12:01.411 --> 12:04.790
..Lord High Majesty
ofthe Purple Hand Gang.

12:04.830 --> 12:06.416
ALL: Yeah!

12:06.750 --> 12:09.544
ALL: One, two, three, four.

12:09.586 --> 12:11.671
(heavy rock music)

12:15.508 --> 12:19.304
Here at Ashton Primary,
we have nothing to hide.

12:19.346 --> 12:21.014
# Gonna be a big star

12:21.848 --> 12:23.642
# See my name in lights

12:24.476 --> 12:26.019
# Gonna play my guitar

12:26.060 --> 12:27.562
(distant thumping music)

12:28.187 --> 12:29.272
Erm...

12:29.313 --> 12:31.817
# But my homework is waiting for me

12:31.858 --> 12:34.277
# There's no escape and no TV

12:34.693 --> 12:39.199
# Why does homework
always get you down, down, down?

12:39.240 --> 12:41.576
# Gonna be a rock star

12:41.617 --> 12:44.079
# We don't need to go to school

12:44.120 --> 12:46.373
# Gonna be a rock star

12:46.413 --> 12:49.668
- (distant thumping music)
- Absolutely nothing to hide.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.253
(both chuckle)

12:51.294 --> 12:53.838
# Just you wait and see

12:53.880 --> 12:59.886
# Cos the boy on that stage will be me

13:04.139 --> 13:06.643
(music increases in volume)

13:13.774 --> 13:15.276
Yeah!

13:18.737 --> 13:20.782
(music finishes)

13:24.493 --> 13:26.496
(sings quietly to himsel_

13:26.537 --> 13:28.790
Just what do you think you're doing?

13:28.832 --> 13:30.375
(gasps)

13:30.417 --> 13:32.252
Erm...

13:32.709 --> 13:36.673
..practising for the talent contest,
Miss Oddbod.

13:36.713 --> 13:38.091
l see.

13:38.132 --> 13:42.178
And are you practising trying to get
this school closed down, too?

13:43.805 --> 13:45.223
Erm...

13:47.266 --> 13:51.062
And get down from there right now,
you...horrid boy.

13:55.567 --> 13:56.860
(thud)

13:56.900 --> 13:59.529
Miss Oddbod doesn't believe in rock stars.

13:59.571 --> 14:03.575
But l know the Zero Zombies
can win the talent contest.

14:10.832 --> 14:13.585
Oh! Missed, bogey brain!

14:19.257 --> 14:20.592
Huh?

14:27.139 --> 14:29.726
- Hey, Margaret. Check this out.
- Huh?

14:31.936 --> 14:34.439
Please! That'll never hit me.

14:34.479 --> 14:36.441
Ordinarily she'd be right.

14:36.482 --> 14:38.151
But l have a plan.

14:38.192 --> 14:41.029
lt's called Flick the Bogey.

14:41.070 --> 14:43.990
Carefully worked out
with military precision,

14:44.032 --> 14:47.327
and resulting in a devastating
airburst attack.

14:50.495 --> 14:52.165
(screams)

14:52.915 --> 14:54.083
Henry!

14:54.124 --> 14:56.502
l'll get you, Henry!

14:59.297 --> 15:00.381
Aagh!

15:00.422 --> 15:03.092
- (thump and splash)
- Aagh! Mum!

15:03.133 --> 15:05.511
MUM:
Homework, Henry.

15:06.261 --> 15:07.972
lt's just not fair, Fang.

15:08.014 --> 15:12.477
Homework should be climbing trees,
building forts and playing with mates.

15:12.517 --> 15:14.771
This is my best mate. Fang.

15:14.812 --> 15:16.647
He can climb steep walls.

15:16.688 --> 15:20.526
He can walk on the ceiling
like Spiderhamster.

15:20.568 --> 15:21.986
He can jump.

15:22.027 --> 15:23.988
He can exercise.

15:24.654 --> 15:26.783
He has bionic teeth.

15:28.242 --> 15:30.912
And...he can sing!

15:30.953 --> 15:32.788
(muffled singing)

15:35.207 --> 15:38.920
When l'm king,
parents shall do all the homework.

15:41.087 --> 15:43.841
# When l'm king, yeah, when l'm king

15:43.883 --> 15:47.094
# The sun will come out
and the birds will sing

15:47.136 --> 15:50.056
# When l'm king, yeah, when l'm king

15:50.097 --> 15:53.142
# The sun will come out
and the birds will sing

15:53.183 --> 15:55.895
# When l'm king, yeah, when l'm king

15:55.936 --> 15:59.607
# l'll be able to do anything

16:00.024 --> 16:03.235
# When l'm king

16:06.112 --> 16:09.075
You're supposed to be doing
your homework, Henry.

16:09.115 --> 16:11.535
Yeah, l am doing my homework, worm.

16:11.576 --> 16:13.454
Rock star's homework.

16:14.037 --> 16:16.123
- Mum!
- You don't have to tell on me!

16:16.165 --> 16:17.541
- Yes, l do.
- Why?

16:17.582 --> 16:19.794
Henry's not doing his homework!

16:19.835 --> 16:20.961
MUM:
Henry!

16:21.003 --> 16:24.882
Why do you have to be so perfect, Peter?

16:24.924 --> 16:27.635
- (growls)
- Aagh!

16:29.845 --> 16:31.597
Help!

16:31.638 --> 16:34.392
Aaaaaaagh!

16:34.975 --> 16:36.852
(thumping)

16:41.439 --> 16:42.733
l am sick and tired...

16:42.775 --> 16:43.818
Yes, Dad?

16:45.152 --> 16:47.780
Ah, you're...doing your homework.

16:48.196 --> 16:51.492
Yeah. l'm doing physics.

16:52.742 --> 16:54.286
Right.

16:54.327 --> 16:56.247
Good.

16:59.249 --> 17:00.793
Bye, then.

17:01.836 --> 17:06.298
Yeah. Physics has given me
some great ideas

17:06.339 --> 17:09.760
for gooing Moody Margaret. Ha-ha.

17:10.301 --> 17:14.306
OK, just a little bit tighter.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

17:14.348 --> 17:16.016
Come on, it's OK, it's OK.

17:16.057 --> 17:18.602
OK. Oh, gosh. OK.

17:18.644 --> 17:20.479
Erm...tie this tight.

17:23.691 --> 17:26.902
Ha! Try that for size, slug features.

17:26.944 --> 17:30.030
Yeah, slug features. (laughs)

17:38.246 --> 17:39.540
Henry.

17:39.581 --> 17:41.583
Yes, Miss Battle-Axe?

17:41.624 --> 17:45.129
- Teachers first.
- Oh, of course, Miss Battle-Axe.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.803
(gasps)

17:53.928 --> 17:55.556
Allow me.

18:03.062 --> 18:04.982
(all gasp)

18:08.152 --> 18:09.945
(all laugh)

18:13.739 --> 18:15.868
He-e-e-e-enry!

18:16.534 --> 18:18.954
Oh, why is it always me?

18:20.496 --> 18:23.876
We simply cannot allow
this sort of behaviour to continue.

18:23.916 --> 18:26.128
The inspectors have made it very clear

18:26.170 --> 18:28.922
that this school
is under serious threat of closure.

18:28.964 --> 18:31.091
There's only one course of action.

18:31.132 --> 18:32.759
But, Cynthia...

18:33.343 --> 18:35.554
..l'm the backbone ofthe school.

18:35.595 --> 18:38.932
- You cannot let this happen to me.
- She can and she will.

18:38.973 --> 18:42.603
- Ooh.
- l'll handle this myself, thank you.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.563
Boudicca...

18:44.605 --> 18:49.651
..you and l have worked too long
and too hard to see this school closed.

18:49.692 --> 18:53.697
The inspectors have commented on
a total lack of discipline...

18:53.739 --> 18:57.034
There's no lack of discipline
in my classroom.

18:57.075 --> 18:59.077
(shouting)

18:59.118 --> 19:00.746
..out of control pupils...

19:00.787 --> 19:03.957
My pupils are certainly not out of control.

19:03.998 --> 19:06.335
(shouting)

19:06.375 --> 19:08.378
..and a dismal homework record.

19:12.716 --> 19:15.218
(whispers):
That horrid boy.

19:16.344 --> 19:19.139
l was never able to teach him anything.

19:20.265 --> 19:23.769
l've been told l have to make
an example of somebody.

19:23.809 --> 19:25.354
So l'm afraid...

19:28.732 --> 19:30.567
(shouting)

19:51.922 --> 19:53.381
(sighs)

19:56.051 --> 19:58.136
You can go home now.

19:59.053 --> 20:00.680
What?

20:00.722 --> 20:02.557
You what, Miss Battle-Axe?

20:03.974 --> 20:07.687
You heard me, Margaret.
You can all go home early.

20:09.105 --> 20:10.357
ALL:
Yes!

20:57.862 --> 21:02.909
And following our exclusive report
exclusively reporting on declining...

21:02.950 --> 21:05.036
- Hey, Mum.
- You're home early, boys.

21:05.078 --> 21:06.287
Can l have one?

21:06.328 --> 21:08.373
Miss Battle-Axe let us go early.

21:08.414 --> 21:09.958
Awesome.

21:09.998 --> 21:13.545
TV_. Ashton Primary School's
Iongest-serving teacher,

21:13.585 --> 21:15.088
Miss Battle-Axe,

21:15.129 --> 21:16.965
has been sacked.

21:18.133 --> 21:22.554
Miss Battle-Axe...has been...sacked?

21:22.595 --> 21:26.141
Ah, Miss Battle-Axe.
Can you give us a statement?

21:27.267 --> 21:30.311
l'll be back, Henry, you horrid boy.

21:31.812 --> 21:35.859
REPORTER: Mr Vic Van Wrinkle,
the headmaster of Brickhouse School,

21:35.900 --> 21:37.068
Hey, Ralph, wait up!

21:37.109 --> 21:42.031
the exclusive and very expensive school,
commented, saying,

21:42.073 --> 21:43.700
''lt's a sad and sorry state of amairs

21:43.741 --> 21:47.453
when a school cannot keep
its own pupils in order."

21:48.121 --> 21:51.541
Well, looks like my little plan is working.

21:52.625 --> 21:55.628
lt won't be long before the parents
of all those children

21:55.670 --> 21:58.256
will be paying me lots of money
for them to come here.

21:58.298 --> 21:59.799
Brickhouse School.

22:00.799 --> 22:04.679
Because...there won't be
an Ashton Primary School

22:04.720 --> 22:07.181
for them to go to any more.

22:07.223 --> 22:09.058
Now...

22:09.559 --> 22:14.105
..let's see ifwe can make this boy Henry
even more horrid, shall we?

22:14.147 --> 22:17.150
Shall we? Come on. Do it!

22:20.695 --> 22:23.865
Someone's here to see you,
Miss Oddbod. It's er...

22:23.906 --> 22:26.326
..about Miss Battle-Axe's old job.

22:26.366 --> 22:29.329
How strange. We haven't advertised it yet.

22:29.370 --> 22:31.497
- Show them in, Sidmouth.
- Right.

22:37.920 --> 22:42.800
l understand you have an opening
for a very fine teacher.

22:42.842 --> 22:44.719
Which l am, Jimmy.

22:45.678 --> 22:48.389
l'm sorry, what did you say your name was?

22:48.430 --> 22:50.641
Erm...Beowulf.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.896
Beowulf Battering-Ram. Ha-ha.

22:55.979 --> 22:58.191
Oh, Boudicca.

22:58.232 --> 23:00.943
You do know l can't offer you
your old job back.

23:00.984 --> 23:03.362
Oh, please, Miss Oddbod!

23:04.070 --> 23:05.740
Well...er...

23:07.366 --> 23:10.578
..we'll keep your details on file and let you know.

23:10.619 --> 23:11.996
Sidmouth?

23:12.038 --> 23:14.707
Could you show this...gentleman out, please?

23:14.748 --> 23:16.125
This way, sir.

23:16.166 --> 23:17.919
Whoa!

23:18.377 --> 23:19.795

23:22.006 --> 23:23.841
(growls)

23:29.137 --> 23:30.890
Oh, dear.

23:35.101 --> 23:36.687
Mow, then, boys and girls,

23:36.728 --> 23:39.607
Miss Battle-Axe's class
will be joining us today,

23:39.649 --> 23:42.485
so we'll have to squeeze in together, OK?

23:43.526 --> 23:45.780
Bunch up a bit in the background.

23:45.820 --> 23:47.740
Quickly, please.

23:47.782 --> 23:52.495
Settle down, everybody, as quick as you can,
in your seats. Right.

23:52.536 --> 23:57.083
Does anyone want to tell me anything
before we have our singsong?

23:58.833 --> 24:00.211
Yes, Peter?

24:00.252 --> 24:04.256
Yesterday, l put a red crayon
in the yellow crayon box, Miss Lovely.

24:04.673 --> 24:05.716
Oh.

24:05.758 --> 24:09.095
- And l took it out again, Miss Lovely.
- OK.

24:10.011 --> 24:12.515
And l wiped it clean with a cloth, Miss Lovely.

24:13.099 --> 24:16.060
And l put it in the red crayon box,
Miss Lovely.

24:16.101 --> 24:19.313
Well, how lovely is that?

24:19.355 --> 24:21.941
You really are my best boys.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.985
_fMR__. Ugh. Peter and his miends
make me sick.

24:25.485 --> 24:27.446
- Eugh!

24:27.487 --> 24:29.657
Now, boys and girls,

24:29.698 --> 24:33.160
today in class we're going to learn
all about France.

24:33.202 --> 24:37.081
To start with, we're going to sing a song
called Frère Jacques.

24:37.121 --> 24:39.792
Can anyone tell me
what Frère Jacques means?

24:39.832 --> 24:41.877
ALL: Me!
- Got any sweets, Henry?

24:41.961 --> 24:43.504
Er...yeah.

24:45.089 --> 24:48.592
Henry, can you tell me
what Frère Jacques means?

24:48.633 --> 24:50.094
Yeah, nose pickers!

24:50.135 --> 24:51.595
(laughter)

24:51.637 --> 24:54.431
All right. Settle down, everybody.

24:54.473 --> 24:56.350
Thank you. That's lovely, Henry.

24:56.392 --> 24:58.602
Now, then, shall we all sing together?

24:58.644 --> 25:00.604
# Frère Jacques

25:00.771 --> 25:02.648
# Frère Jacques

25:02.689 --> 25:04.316
# Dormez-vous?

25:04.358 --> 25:07.486
Got any more Frère Jacques in there,
dingbat dodo?

25:07.611 --> 25:09.613
Hey, what you doing? That's mine.

25:09.655 --> 25:11.657
l only want to look at it.

25:11.699 --> 25:13.784
Give it back, Moody Margaret!

25:13.826 --> 25:15.869
Ooh-ee stressy!

25:15.911 --> 25:17.329
# Frère Jacques

25:17.370 --> 25:21.166
Stop. Right, that's it. You asked for it!

25:24.127 --> 25:25.671

Hey, that's not my gross goo.

Nice one, bogey brain.

25:49.402 --> 25:51.947
- Yeah. Nice one, Henry.
- It wasn't me.

25:54.199 --> 25:55.951
Oooh!

26:12.592 --> 26:14.052
Move.

26:23.269 --> 26:25.856
She's banned the Zero Zombies, Henry.

26:28.274 --> 26:30.819
What? We've been taken offthe list?

26:30.860 --> 26:34.197
Ha! Oh, Henry, not going to be
a pop star after all?

26:34.238 --> 26:37.576
- Get used to it.
- Yeah, get used to it.

26:37.617 --> 26:41.496
Hey, check it out. It's called
walking the magnetic moggy.

26:41.537 --> 26:43.999
Yeah, magnetic moggy.

26:46.043 --> 26:49.796
(tearfully): You're not in the talent
contest any more, Henry.

26:49.837 --> 26:52.132
What you gonna do now, Henry?

26:52.173 --> 26:54.635
- l dunno.
- Er...er...

26:58.889 --> 27:01.266
Oh, get offthe table.

27:01.307 --> 27:02.726
(miaow)

27:03.518 --> 27:05.103
(door chime)

27:05.312 --> 27:07.189
MUM:
Hello, Ruby.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.319
Rich Aunt Ruby and stuck-up Steve.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.988
My favourite cousin. Not.

27:15.030 --> 27:17.365
Did someone say,
Polly put the kettle on?

27:17.407 --> 27:18.825
(baby retches)

27:19.533 --> 27:22.370
Prissy Polly and Vomiting Vera.
(baby retches)

27:22.411 --> 27:24.706
Could life get any better?

27:24.747 --> 27:27.250
- l'll put the kettle on, Polly.
- Mum...

27:28.251 --> 27:30.378
- Henry.
- Yeah, what?

27:30.420 --> 27:33.840
Tell Peter the tea's ready
and wash your hands.

27:34.299 --> 27:35.926
Oh, come on.

27:37.092 --> 27:38.887
(sighs)

27:40.305 --> 27:43.850
l hear Ashton Primary School's
closing down.

27:43.892 --> 27:47.854
Well, it does seem as though
they're losing a lot ofteachers.

27:47.896 --> 27:51.191
Think about sending the boys
to Brickhouse.

27:52.399 --> 27:54.861
But isn't Brickhouse very expensive?

27:54.903 --> 27:58.073
Well, yes.
That's the whole point, really.

27:58.113 --> 28:01.076
But they do produce the most clever boys.

28:01.660 --> 28:04.204
# You're 2 cool 4 school

28:04.246 --> 28:05.622
(bone crunching)

28:06.623 --> 28:07.832
(squelching)

28:09.000 --> 28:11.044
# Wanna win some money

28:11.086 --> 28:13.588
# 2 cool 4 school
# Be nobody's fool

28:13.630 --> 28:14.714
# 2 cool 4 school

28:14.756 --> 28:17.008
# Then maybe, just maybe

28:17.050 --> 28:19.260
# You're 2 cool 4 school

28:19.301 --> 28:21.304
2 Cool 4 School!

28:21.345 --> 28:24.265
This is one of my most
favourite TV shows ever.

28:24.307 --> 28:27.352
l watch it every week
and nothing can stop me.

28:27.393 --> 28:29.604
Mummy, Henry insists
on watching 2 Cool 4 School

28:29.645 --> 28:31.606
and l want to watch Business For Boys.

28:31.648 --> 28:35.944
l must have said please 52 million times
and he won't budge.

28:37.153 --> 28:40.657
You see? Clever and charming.

28:40.697 --> 28:41.908
(baby retches)

28:41.949 --> 28:44.411
ln order to open
a building society account...

28:44.994 --> 28:46.162
This is not fair.

28:46.204 --> 28:50.917
This is my house. l should be allowed
to watch what l want on TV.

28:52.668 --> 28:56.297
When l'm king,
l'll force stuck-up Steve...

28:56.338 --> 28:58.633
l am not stuck-up, l'm posh.

28:58.674 --> 29:02.262
..to watch every single episode
of 2 Cool 4 School

29:02.302 --> 29:03.930
three billion times!

29:03.972 --> 29:05.473
No-o-o-o-o-o!

29:05.515 --> 29:08.768
There's a try-out day coming up
in Brickhouse.

29:08.809 --> 29:10.687
Why don't you take a look?

29:11.186 --> 29:13.731
We'll think about it, Ruby. l promise.

29:14.231 --> 29:17.277
l'm not going to that
mouldy old Brickhouse.

29:17.318 --> 29:19.863
Ha! Think they'd have a horrid boy like you?

29:19.904 --> 29:22.490
Shut up! Do you know
how stuck-up you sound?

29:22.532 --> 29:23.741
(baby retches)

29:23.783 --> 29:25.743
POLLY:
Oh, sorry.

29:25.784 --> 29:27.245
Not again.

29:27.286 --> 29:29.664
lt doesn't matter. Don't be silly.

29:29.705 --> 29:31.958
Ooh, l am starving.

29:32.333 --> 29:34.043
Anything left for me?

29:34.084 --> 29:35.378
Ah.

29:35.419 --> 29:37.338
- O-o-oh.
- (gasps)

29:39.006 --> 29:40.550
Ugh...

29:40.590 --> 29:42.760
Er... Ooh.

29:42.802 --> 29:44.262
Eugh-yuk.

29:47.223 --> 29:48.391
What?

29:48.432 --> 29:50.059
(phone rings)

29:51.477 --> 29:53.438
Bed, Henry. Now.

29:54.396 --> 29:56.983
Hello. Ashton 5-8-6.

29:57.024 --> 30:00.028
Oh, how lovely to hear from you,
Great Aunt Greta.

30:00.069 --> 30:02.989
Great Aunt Greta? She thinks l'm a girl.

30:03.029 --> 30:05.867
Yes, yes. Henrietta is fine.

30:05.907 --> 30:07.118
See?

30:07.159 --> 30:11.164
Well, yes, it does seem as though
Ashton Primary School is in trouble.

30:12.873 --> 30:14.834
Oh.

30:15.668 --> 30:17.879
Oh. Right.

30:18.462 --> 30:20.715
OK. Goodbye, then.

30:22.090 --> 30:23.342
Bad news?

30:23.383 --> 30:25.344
No. Rather good news, actually.

30:26.137 --> 30:29.056
Great Aunt Greta
heard about Ashton Primary,

30:29.097 --> 30:32.059
so she's booked Peter in
for the Brickhouse try-out day.

30:32.101 --> 30:35.313
We can't afford to send the boys there.

30:35.353 --> 30:37.440
She says she'll pay for him to go.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.693
Oh. What about Henry?

30:41.277 --> 30:45.156
Great Aunt Greta has something else in
mind for Henry to try out.

30:46.991 --> 30:49.243
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

31:23.444 --> 31:24.654
(snarls)

31:25.403 --> 31:27.990
So spirited, just like in my day.

31:28.031 --> 31:29.116
Go Giddiantus!

31:29.158 --> 31:32.787
- They're all girls!
- That's right, dear. Lots of curls.

31:33.621 --> 31:38.209
l found this in my attic.
It's yours now, Henrietta.

31:39.293 --> 31:41.504
Just what l always wanted.

31:41.670 --> 31:45.257
Om you go, Henrietta,
and show them what you're made of.

31:48.010 --> 31:49.428
Agh!

31:58.896 --> 32:01.524
Eugh! It's a boy!

32:01.940 --> 32:04.902
Yuk. Shall we put it out of its misery?

32:05.194 --> 32:06.946
(school bell rings)

32:09.323 --> 32:10.783
Later, loser.

32:10.825 --> 32:14.370
- Enter at your peril, boy.
- Yeah, watch out.

32:19.582 --> 32:21.627
Stuck in a girls' school.

32:21.668 --> 32:23.587
Could life get any worse?

32:23.629 --> 32:24.922
(screeching tyres)

32:31.512 --> 32:34.515
l said we would be late
and now we are late.

32:34.557 --> 32:37.101
We're always late
and it's always your fault.

32:37.141 --> 32:39.103
But, sweetness...

32:39.143 --> 32:42.022
Don't you sweetness me.

32:42.063 --> 32:43.607
Just give me my stuff.

32:43.648 --> 32:45.526
Oh, sorry, my precious.

32:46.234 --> 32:48.779
At least there won't be any smelly boys...

32:48.820 --> 32:51.824
Oh, great! What's he doing...?

32:51.865 --> 32:53.826
(distant car horn tune)

32:54.451 --> 32:57.037
Well...bird brain.

32:57.079 --> 32:58.998
l asked you a question.

32:59.038 --> 33:02.459
Erm...my Great Aunt Greta
thinks l'm a girl.

33:02.501 --> 33:04.211
That figures.

33:04.252 --> 33:07.840
Just don't expect me to sit next to you,
toad breath.

33:12.094 --> 33:14.179
(whispered voices)

33:17.057 --> 33:19.184
- (door closes)
- (gasps)

33:22.687 --> 33:26.400
Oh, my goodness.
They know there's a boy here.

33:26.442 --> 33:29.403
What? What did you say?
l can't hear you.

33:29.443 --> 33:31.280
l think they're after you.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.449
Run away!

33:39.871 --> 33:41.623
Huh?

33:42.332 --> 33:44.126
Miss Battle-Axe?

33:44.168 --> 33:47.546
Oh, Henry, you horrid boy.

33:52.425 --> 33:54.303
Margaret?

33:54.678 --> 33:56.346
Margaret?

33:59.473 --> 34:01.101
Margaret?

34:05.396 --> 34:06.523
Margaret?

34:20.369 --> 34:22.914
ls this your idea of a joke?

34:22.955 --> 34:24.583
Ssh.

34:31.172 --> 34:33.507
Don't even think about laughing.

34:36.844 --> 34:37.888
(gasps)

34:37.929 --> 34:40.389
GIRL:
Why is there a boy?

34:42.266 --> 34:44.351
(whispered voices):
Get the boy.

34:50.358 --> 34:52.444
(whispering):
Get the boy!

35:00.159 --> 35:02.120
(farts)

35:04.163 --> 35:05.999
Quickly! Run!

35:06.041 --> 35:07.709
(girls shout)

35:32.566 --> 35:36.029
Yes, of course, school inspectors,
l've got all your money.

35:36.070 --> 35:40.867
Must go now. Have to welcome
new pupils from Ashton Primary.

35:48.625 --> 35:51.670
Welcome one, welcome all.

35:58.926 --> 36:02.305
OK, here we are.
Right. Ready to go, then, Peter?

36:02.347 --> 36:06.142
Yes, Dad. It looks...very big, though.

36:06.183 --> 36:08.770
Don't worry.
You'll be OK once you get in there.

36:08.811 --> 36:09.896
OK.

36:16.861 --> 36:18.571
Miss Lovely!

36:18.612 --> 36:21.533
Peter. What a lovely surprise.

36:21.574 --> 36:24.035
What are you doing here, Miss Lovely?

36:24.077 --> 36:25.787
l've come to see the headmaster.

36:25.829 --> 36:28.289
- About getting a job here?
- Well, yes.

36:33.377 --> 36:35.505
That would be oh, so lovely.

36:41.302 --> 36:43.304
l'm having a try-out day today.

36:43.888 --> 36:46.349
Well, how lovely is that?

36:47.516 --> 36:49.561
Shall we, Peter?

36:58.111 --> 37:00.071
Bye, then.

37:03.366 --> 37:05.618
Welcome to Brickhouse School.

37:06.076 --> 37:11.374
Here at Brickhouse, we pride ourselves on
tradition and accomplishment.

37:11.415 --> 37:13.918
And we also encourage every child

37:13.959 --> 37:17.422
to make a contribution
to the glory of our school.

37:17.922 --> 37:19.299
Yah, we do.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.676
(clicks fingers)

37:21.800 --> 37:23.428
# TWENTY TWENTY:
Get Down

37:26.471 --> 37:28.141
# Whoa ah oh

37:28.557 --> 37:31.269
# l can't slow down,
slow down, slow down

37:31.309 --> 37:33.771
# You're making my heart stop beating

37:33.812 --> 37:36.315
# Please don't let me down

37:36.356 --> 37:38.234
# Don't let me down

37:38.276 --> 37:40.278
# So let's stop pretending

37:40.319 --> 37:42.947
# And drop the small talk now

37:42.989 --> 37:44.782
# Whoa ah oh

37:44.823 --> 37:47.910
# Can we get down,

37:47.951 --> 37:49.787
# And drop the small talk

37:49.829 --> 37:51.456
# Whoa ah oh

37:51.496 --> 37:54.625
# l can't slow down,

37:54.666 --> 37:57.128
# You're making my heart stop beating

37:57.169 --> 37:59.672
# Please don't let me down

37:59.714 --> 38:01.799
# Don't let me down

38:01.840 --> 38:03.759
# So let's stop pretending

38:03.801 --> 38:06.637
# And drop the small talk now

38:09.347 --> 38:10.766
Thank you.

38:12.934 --> 38:14.687
Thank you.

38:14.729 --> 38:16.272
Right. Peter.

38:16.689 --> 38:18.983
Why don't you show us what you can do?

38:19.025 --> 38:20.735
Come along.

38:22.736 --> 38:24.363
Come along, don't be shy.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.075
Good boy.

38:31.036 --> 38:32.997
Sing something, Peter.

38:33.039 --> 38:34.916
Something lovely.

38:40.629 --> 38:43.007
# Frère Jacques

38:43.131 --> 38:45.468
# Frère Jacques

38:45.509 --> 38:47.470
# Dormez-vous

38:47.886 --> 38:49.305
# Dormez-vous...

38:50.097 --> 38:52.391
How dare you show up here?

38:52.432 --> 38:54.101
# Sonnez les matines

38:54.142 --> 38:56.395
# Ding dang dong

38:56.520 --> 38:58.606
# Ding dang dong

39:02.610 --> 39:04.320
Close the door!

39:07.614 --> 39:09.116
Finished, Peter?

39:13.495 --> 39:15.623
No, there's another verse.

39:15.664 --> 39:17.833
(upbeat Country and Western)

39:17.875 --> 39:19.210
# Frère Jacques

39:19.502 --> 39:21.087
# Frère Jacques

39:21.127 --> 39:24.423
# Mama's callin', Mama's callin'

39:24.465 --> 39:27.510
# Come a-home to Nashville,
come a-home to Nashville

39:27.550 --> 39:28.969
# Yee hi yay

39:29.093 --> 39:30.763
# Yee hi yay

39:35.183 --> 39:39.313
..Ashton closes down with the worst school
report ever - the rest of your money.

39:44.860 --> 39:48.906
lt's perfectly simple. l've explained it
to you a hundred times.

39:48.947 --> 39:50.991
A series of disasters occurs at the school.

39:51.032 --> 39:56.455
The authorities give it such a low rating
Miss Oddbod will have to close it down.

39:56.497 --> 39:58.457
- (gasps)
- (glass smashes)

40:04.504 --> 40:06.423
Ah, Miss Lovely.

40:07.967 --> 40:09.885
(heavy rock beat)

40:13.138 --> 40:14.598
# Frère Jacques

40:14.847 --> 40:16.267
# Frère Jacques

40:16.308 --> 40:17.726
# Where are you?

40:17.934 --> 40:19.561
# Where are you?

40:19.602 --> 40:21.021
# Bedtime is for babies

40:21.104 --> 40:22.690
# Bedtime is for babies

40:22.730 --> 40:24.149
# Get up now

40:24.399 --> 40:25.734
# Get up now

40:25.775 --> 40:29.154
(operatic):
# Jack my brother, Jack my brother

40:29.196 --> 40:32.241
# Do you sleep? Do you sleep?

40:32.282 --> 40:35.452
# For it is the morning,
for it is the morning

40:35.494 --> 40:38.664
# 'Tis my song, 'tis my song

40:38.706 --> 40:40.958
# Oh, oh, oh

40:40.998 --> 40:43.585
# (high note): Oh

40:43.626 --> 40:45.671
(cheering)

40:45.711 --> 40:47.673
Bravo!

40:50.050 --> 40:53.011
Well, well, Peter, you seem to have
impressed us all.

40:53.052 --> 40:54.888
ls it time to go now, Miss Lovely?

40:54.929 --> 40:59.184
Miss Lovely and l will have a chat
while you tour the school.

40:59.225 --> 41:01.311
Your Good As Gold book, Peter.

41:01.562 --> 41:03.772
My Good As Gold book?

41:03.813 --> 41:06.692
- Take care of it, Peter.
- l will, Miss Lovely.

41:11.905 --> 41:13.323
BOTH:
Aaaaagh!

41:16.951 --> 41:18.203
(clears throat)

41:18.245 --> 41:20.998
l am never, ever going to that school,

41:21.038 --> 41:24.626
even if my dad pays double
for them to have me. l mean...

41:25.751 --> 41:27.212
Er...Henry.

41:28.046 --> 41:29.882
You can let go of my hand now.

41:30.257 --> 41:31.550
Eugh!

41:31.591 --> 41:33.802
Things were getting really serious.

41:33.844 --> 41:37.639
lt was time for an emergency meeting of
the Purple Hand Gang.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.350
Why have we got to save the school?

41:40.391 --> 41:42.311
What are we gonna do, Henry?

41:42.769 --> 41:45.480
lf our school closes down,
we're all in trouble.

41:45.521 --> 41:48.483
l thought you'd be happy
ifthe school closed.

41:48.525 --> 41:50.944
Normally l would be. Very happy.

41:50.986 --> 41:54.740
Exactly. Cos Ashton Primary's mega-horrible.

41:54.781 --> 41:56.241
l dunno.

41:56.283 --> 41:59.536
Miss Oddbod confiscates
everything in sight.

41:59.744 --> 42:03.707
And Soggy Sid always makes you do
22 laps ofthe football pitch.

42:03.748 --> 42:05.834
- Yeah, he does.
- When it's snowing.

42:05.875 --> 42:07.502
You're missing the point.

42:07.543 --> 42:10.005
The Demon Dinner lady
confiscates our snacks.

42:10.046 --> 42:11.965
l know!

42:12.007 --> 42:15.177
So why do you wanna save it, then, Henry?

42:16.385 --> 42:18.263
Because...

42:19.513 --> 42:21.349
..because...

42:22.934 --> 42:25.979
..because...it's not Brickhouse

42:26.021 --> 42:28.315
or Our Lady Giddiantus.

42:28.355 --> 42:30.776
And that means, it's ours.

42:30.817 --> 42:32.486
Yeah, it's ours.

42:36.780 --> 42:39.910
lt may be all the things you said
and way more, too,

42:39.950 --> 42:43.830
but it's our school and we can't let
anyone take that away from us.

42:43.872 --> 42:45.332
He's right.

42:46.624 --> 42:48.627
Remember our school motto?

42:49.461 --> 42:50.712
Ad...

42:52.172 --> 42:54.007
(whispers)

42:54.548 --> 42:56.301
Ad solum esperanto.

42:57.260 --> 43:00.513
ALL:
Ad solum esperanto!

43:01.348 --> 43:03.975
So how are we gonna save the school, Henry?

43:04.017 --> 43:05.727
Er... Oh, l dunno.

43:05.769 --> 43:09.272
You are such a dingbat, Henry.

43:09.314 --> 43:10.440
What's she doing here?

43:10.481 --> 43:14.069
To help you come up with a plan
to save the school.

43:14.110 --> 43:17.030
l thought we were supposed
to be coming up with a plan

43:17.072 --> 43:19.950
to get back into the talent contest, Henry.

43:19.990 --> 43:21.743
- (thunder rumbles)
- Yeah, we were.

43:21.785 --> 43:23.787
Eureka! That's it!

43:25.538 --> 43:28.583
- That's what, Henry?
- That's it! The talent contest.

43:28.625 --> 43:31.461
You know what?
Here's what we're gonna do.

43:31.502 --> 43:37.133
We'll get back into the talent contest,
we win it, and then we'll be famous!

43:37.174 --> 43:38.885
(all cheer)

43:38.927 --> 43:42.222
What? So famous that
they can't close the school down?

43:42.263 --> 43:44.557
Well, it might just work.

43:44.598 --> 43:46.309
(all cheer)

43:47.477 --> 43:50.730
And no-one has to go
to that Brickhouse.

43:50.897 --> 43:52.524
Or Our Lady Giddiantus.

43:52.565 --> 43:55.443
So we just have to win
the talent contest?

43:55.484 --> 43:56.611
That's right.

43:56.653 --> 44:00.782
(tearfully): But you're not
in the talent contest, Henry.

44:01.698 --> 44:05.912
You leave that bit to me,
Lord High Majesty ofthe Purple Hand Gang.

44:05.953 --> 44:08.456
Yeah. Go Zero Zombies!

44:08.706 --> 44:10.125
(imitate guitar riffs)

44:13.336 --> 44:15.380
(chatter)

44:21.009 --> 44:23.096
- All clear, Brian.
- Oh, good.

44:23.136 --> 44:24.931
Good luck, Brian.

44:39.571 --> 44:41.364
Thank you.

44:43.907 --> 44:45.910
Brian's in.

44:45.951 --> 44:47.161
Amazing.

44:48.203 --> 44:50.373
ln we go. That's it. Show your tickets.

44:51.040 --> 44:52.625
Sid?

44:53.626 --> 44:55.670
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

44:56.170 --> 44:57.839
lt's Soggy Sid!

44:57.879 --> 44:59.507
What's he doing here?

44:59.882 --> 45:04.303
He's here to make sure the Zero Zombies
don't get sneaked in.

45:04.344 --> 45:07.640
l can't believe you peanut brains
didn't think ofthat.

45:07.682 --> 45:09.684
What we gonna do now?

45:09.726 --> 45:12.395
Do l have to think of everything?

45:16.399 --> 45:18.526
l dunno.

45:20.778 --> 45:22.238
- Hey!
- (crunching bite)

45:22.280 --> 45:25.616
Oh, yeah, that's Vicious Vicky,
Sour Susan's sister.

45:27.034 --> 45:30.496
- Sorry. Vicky does that sometimes.
- She bit me.

45:30.997 --> 45:32.957
ln you go.

45:34.916 --> 45:37.503
- Where are they?
- They're just coming.

45:37.544 --> 45:39.005
lfthey don't win...

45:39.338 --> 45:41.549
Ah, Margaret.

45:41.591 --> 45:44.093
Nice to see you supporting local talent.

45:44.135 --> 45:45.219
Yes, sir.

45:45.261 --> 45:48.181
- Here to see Zero Zombies, are we?
- Never heard ofthem, sir.

45:48.848 --> 45:50.183
Go on, in you go.

46:02.569 --> 46:04.197
Miss Battle-Axe?

46:04.572 --> 46:07.950
Oh, Henry, you horrid boy.

46:11.871 --> 46:15.499
Ah, Giddiantus girls.
Looking forward to the show?

46:15.541 --> 46:18.419
(girly voices): Yes, sir.
BEEFY BERT: l dunno.

46:20.837 --> 46:22.465
- Oi!

46:22.547 --> 46:24.425
(shouting)

46:26.927 --> 46:29.513
(blows whistle) Oi! Come back here!

46:30.889 --> 46:32.308
Where are you?

46:32.349 --> 46:33.851
(band plays)

46:33.892 --> 46:35.853
# Like Robson wants Jerome

46:35.894 --> 46:37.396
# l want you

46:37.438 --> 46:40.441
# Yeah, l want you...

46:43.902 --> 46:45.529
l...must...

46:45.571 --> 46:47.656
Let me through! Aagh!

46:50.617 --> 46:51.660
Over here.

46:52.076 --> 46:53.537
(slams book down)

46:53.579 --> 46:55.331
You're 6.2 seconds late.

46:55.371 --> 46:57.041
Lucky it's only that, then.

46:57.083 --> 46:59.126
l know you're down here. Right.

47:00.878 --> 47:02.129
(panting)

47:02.170 --> 47:04.215
Hello, sir.

47:05.508 --> 47:07.134
Ah.

47:07.175 --> 47:10.262
Hello, there, Brian.
What are you doing in here?

47:10.303 --> 47:12.181
l'm waiting to go on stage, sir.

47:12.223 --> 47:14.391
One ofthe Zero Zombies, are you?

47:14.433 --> 47:16.393
Never heard ofthem, sir.

47:16.435 --> 47:18.521
l'm here to do my...snake-charming act.

47:18.562 --> 47:20.064
Oh...

47:20.855 --> 47:22.775
Would you like to see my snake, sir?

47:23.609 --> 47:24.985
Er...

47:25.026 --> 47:27.988
No... No, thank you. l've just er...

47:28.029 --> 47:29.615

47:29.656 --> 47:31.033
Actually...

47:31.741 --> 47:34.745
..on second thoughts...maybe l will.

47:36.037 --> 47:37.581
(door opens)

47:37.622 --> 47:40.084
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

47:40.124 --> 47:41.919
Here, l know you.

47:41.961 --> 47:45.256
You're one ofthem Killer Boy Rats
unless l'm mistaken.

47:45.296 --> 47:48.759
You're not mistaken.
To whom do l have the pleasure of speaking?

47:48.801 --> 47:52.596
Er...Sidmouth Soggington,
at your service, sir. (squelch)

47:52.637 --> 47:55.724
The pleasure's all mine.
l'm one of your biggest fans.

47:55.765 --> 47:58.852
- It's just amazing.
- Really? Really.

47:58.893 --> 48:01.981
Yeah. l was actually looking
for the washroom.

48:02.856 --> 48:05.359
Of course. Allow me, sir.

48:05.401 --> 48:07.736
This way, if you please.

48:11.657 --> 48:13.534
l'll be back.

48:13.784 --> 48:15.285
Wait for me!

48:15.327 --> 48:17.579
Er...actually...er, yes, just up here.

48:17.620 --> 48:21.291
l'm a bit of a singer myself.
l have a CD. Could l play it to you?

48:21.833 --> 48:23.210
Guys, come out.

48:23.252 --> 48:25.379
That was close.

48:25.419 --> 48:28.257
l can't believe we were in the same room
as Ed Banger.

48:28.298 --> 48:29.341
l know.

48:29.383 --> 48:33.137
l can't believe Soggy Sid
is a fan ofthe Killer Boy Rats.

48:33.178 --> 48:36.265
Almost enough to put me off for life.

48:36.682 --> 48:38.267
Time to let the snakes out.

48:40.352 --> 48:41.436
# Rock down

48:48.277 --> 48:50.445
# Everybody rock the place

48:52.113 --> 48:53.657
# Rock down

48:56.076 --> 48:57.286
# Rock down

49:12.383 --> 49:14.428
# Everybody rock the place

49:15.970 --> 49:18.181
- He's seriously good.

49:20.392 --> 49:22.269
# Everybody rock the place

49:24.146 --> 49:25.814
# Rock down

49:25.855 --> 49:27.607
(cheering)

49:28.275 --> 49:30.110
# Rock down

49:30.151 --> 49:32.237
(cheering)

49:36.616 --> 49:38.994
All right, girls, you're on next.

49:47.877 --> 49:49.796
Er...hi.

49:53.425 --> 49:55.260
ln your own time, girls.

49:56.053 --> 49:58.972
Well, get on with it, bogey brain!

49:59.014 --> 50:00.640
All right, all right.

50:02.558 --> 50:05.187
One...two...three...four.

50:05.228 --> 50:08.398
(guitar riff and drums intro)

50:14.779 --> 50:16.698
# Gonna be a big star

50:17.282 --> 50:18.950
# See my name in lights

50:19.826 --> 50:21.411
# Gonna play my guitar

50:22.369 --> 50:24.247
# Gonna play all night

50:24.955 --> 50:26.833
# Gonna go to town

50:27.499 --> 50:29.085
# My friends and me

50:29.920 --> 50:31.755
# Driving in a big car

50:32.422 --> 50:34.299
# Back in time for tea

50:34.966 --> 50:37.385
# But my homework is waiting for me

50:37.719 --> 50:39.971
# There's no escape and no TV

50:40.222 --> 50:44.768
# Why does homework always get you
down, down, down?

50:44.808 --> 50:47.187
# Gonna be a rock star

50:47.227 --> 50:49.648
# We don't need to go to school

50:49.897 --> 50:52.192
# Gonna be a rock star

50:52.359 --> 50:54.903
# We'll be living by the swimming pool

50:54.945 --> 50:57.280
# Gonna be a rock star...

50:57.321 --> 51:00.825
Right, let's see what you've really got
in that box, eh, son?

51:00.866 --> 51:02.494
Of course, sir.

51:02.826 --> 51:03.953
lt's empty.

51:03.994 --> 51:06.456
Oh, no! It's empty!
My snakes have escaped!

51:06.497 --> 51:08.708
Did someone say snakes? l hate snakes!

51:08.749 --> 51:10.710
- (screaming)
- Don't panic!

51:11.544 --> 51:12.671
(mayhem)

51:12.712 --> 51:14.714
# ..we'll be good to go

51:15.422 --> 51:17.300
# Zero Zombies beat...

51:17.801 --> 51:20.095
Zero Zombies?

51:20.387 --> 51:22.222
# We're gonna jam all night

51:23.014 --> 51:25.392
# We'll be getting on down

51:25.517 --> 51:27.268
# To the morning light

51:28.103 --> 51:30.021
# We'll be fooling around

51:30.479 --> 51:33.233
# But with my homework
l'm stuck here again

51:33.273 --> 51:35.777
# l should be on the stage,
gonna entertain

51:35.818 --> 51:40.490
# Why does homework always get you
down, down, down?

51:40.531 --> 51:42.951
Right, you lot. Omthe stage now!

51:42.991 --> 51:45.328
# Never need to go to school

51:45.495 --> 51:47.539
# Gonna be a rock star

51:48.581 --> 51:50.625
# We won't be nobody's fool

51:50.667 --> 51:52.752
# Gonna be a rock star

51:52.960 --> 51:55.547
# Just you wait and see...

51:56.798 --> 51:59.008
l've got Miss Lovely's notebook.

51:59.050 --> 52:00.635
Look!

52:00.677 --> 52:03.555
- Go, Vicious Vicky.
- Yeah, go, Vicious Vicky.

52:03.596 --> 52:05.682
You are in big trouble!

52:07.057 --> 52:09.269
- (crunching bite)
- Oh, no, get off me!

52:09.310 --> 52:10.436
Help! No!

52:10.478 --> 52:11.980
(crunching bite)

52:14.524 --> 52:16.442
Oh, no! Mercy!

52:16.483 --> 52:17.777
(growling)

52:20.195 --> 52:21.406
(crunching bite)

52:21.447 --> 52:22.991
# ..rock stars

52:23.032 --> 52:25.201
We're gonna save the school!

52:25.867 --> 52:28.371
# We're gonna be rock stars

52:29.037 --> 52:31.040
# We will be nobody's fool

52:31.081 --> 52:32.959
# Gonna be rock stars

52:33.459 --> 52:36.212
# Just you wait and see

52:36.253 --> 52:43.761
# The boy on the stage that can be me

52:43.803 --> 52:45.680
(cheering)

52:52.519 --> 52:53.604
Ha-ha!

52:53.646 --> 52:55.106
(sobs)

52:56.690 --> 52:58.526
You!

52:58.567 --> 53:01.738
l hope you're pleased with yourself!

53:01.778 --> 53:03.656
(agonised sobs)

53:05.448 --> 53:06.868
Come in, Henry.

53:06.908 --> 53:09.078
(sobs continue)

53:11.038 --> 53:12.498
Yes, School Inspector.

53:12.789 --> 53:15.460
l understand perfectly, thank you.

53:22.674 --> 53:24.093
Miss Oddbod. We won!

53:24.134 --> 53:27.513
So, Henry,
you won the Ashton talent contest.

53:27.555 --> 53:31.267
- Yes, Miss Oddbod.
- And you disobeyed my orders,

53:31.309 --> 53:33.936
running rings around Mr Soggington.

53:33.978 --> 53:35.897
Y-Yes, Miss Oddbod.

53:35.938 --> 53:40.693
Mr Soggington has now been removed
from the school with a very sore bottom.

53:40.735 --> 53:42.486
- (giggles)
- Uh.

53:44.363 --> 53:47.825
But none ofthat matters now, Henry.
Do you know why?

53:47.867 --> 53:51.954
Yes, because we won the contest
and we'll be so famous,

53:51.996 --> 53:53.789
the school won't close down.

53:53.830 --> 53:55.541
No, Henry.

53:55.582 --> 54:00.630
lt doesn't matter how famous you become,
this school will still close down.

54:00.670 --> 54:05.635
But...l don't want the school
to get...closed down.

54:05.676 --> 54:09.597
Well, you should have thought ofthat
before you began all this...

54:09.637 --> 54:11.682
..all this horridness.

54:12.766 --> 54:15.853
lt's too late now, Henry.
Just get out.

54:18.105 --> 54:20.024
Yes, Miss Oddbod.

54:43.088 --> 54:45.382
l never thought l'd say this but...

54:46.842 --> 54:49.261
..l am gonna miss Ashton Primary.

54:49.302 --> 54:51.305
(whispering)

55:06.779 --> 55:11.408
''Purple Hand Gang Fort now.
Signed friends.''

55:13.035 --> 55:14.203
Huh?

55:17.206 --> 55:18.999
(purring)

55:26.423 --> 55:29.093
What's going on, worm?
What's she doing here?

55:29.134 --> 55:31.762
Dark forces are at work, Henry.

55:31.804 --> 55:34.264
Peter has valuable information.

55:34.306 --> 55:35.891
We've got to act fast, Henry.

55:35.933 --> 55:37.893
There's no time to lose.

55:38.309 --> 55:41.188
Anyone have a clue
what they're talking about?

55:41.229 --> 55:44.149
When l was at Brickhouse
with Miss Lovely...

55:44.191 --> 55:47.111
What? Miss Lovely was at Brickhouse?

55:47.151 --> 55:49.571
Stay with it, beetle brain. It gets worse.

55:49.612 --> 55:52.533
- She discovered something terrible.
- Terrible.

55:52.574 --> 55:55.285
And what was that terrible thing, Peter?

55:55.326 --> 55:59.456
They didn't polish their marbles
or tidy up their tea cosies?

55:59.497 --> 56:02.960
l don't wanna know.
l'm going back to my nice warm bed.

56:03.001 --> 56:07.256
Wait. Listen. Miss Lovely discovered
that Vic Van Wrinkle...

56:07.296 --> 56:09.675
The evil headmaster of Brickhouse.

56:09.716 --> 56:12.553
..is paying the school inspectors
Iots of money

56:12.593 --> 56:15.722
to make sure Ashton Primary
gets closed down.

56:15.763 --> 56:17.432
Why would they do that?

56:17.474 --> 56:22.688
So everyone will have to pay him lots of money
for their kids to go to Brickhouse instead.

56:22.729 --> 56:25.566
Do l have to join up all the dots round here?

56:25.606 --> 56:27.067
How do you know all this?

56:27.108 --> 56:30.153
Miss Lovely wrote it down
in her notebook. Look.

56:32.781 --> 56:35.200
Maybe we should tell a grown-up
about this.

56:35.242 --> 56:38.579
No. Miss Lovely said we shouldn't. Listen.

56:38.619 --> 56:44.668
l have to get real evidence.
Tell no-one, till l've found out more.

56:44.710 --> 56:46.712
What are we gonna do?

56:46.753 --> 56:50.007
l'll tell you what you're going to do, Henry.

56:50.047 --> 56:52.551
- Have a biscuit.
- What?

56:52.593 --> 56:54.136
You're so weird.

56:54.177 --> 56:58.140
- Just open the tin, you mutant mango!
- All right, all right.

57:00.599 --> 57:02.144
lt's for you, Henry.

57:02.184 --> 57:05.022
Yeah, l can see that.
It's already been opened.

57:05.063 --> 57:08.692
Course it has.
Otherwise how would l know what it says?

57:13.028 --> 57:16.616
''The Terrible Teacher challenges you,
Horrid Henry,

57:16.657 --> 57:19.327
to prove that you are 2 Cool 4 School.''

57:19.368 --> 57:23.874
2 Cool 4 School?
But l didn't ask to be on 2 Cool 4 School.

57:23.915 --> 57:27.252
Well, you're going to be on
2 Cool 4 School tomorrow.

57:27.293 --> 57:30.797
- Tomorrow?
- And you'll win the big cash prize.

57:30.838 --> 57:32.299
The big cash prize?

57:32.339 --> 57:36.386
ls there an echo in here?
You're going to win the big cash prize,

57:36.428 --> 57:38.513
so you can give all the money
to Miss Oddbod,

57:38.554 --> 57:41.099
so she can give all the money
to the school inspectors,

57:41.140 --> 57:47.063
so they can say, thank you,
and then they can go away - far, far away.

57:47.104 --> 57:48.482
But why would l do that?

57:48.522 --> 57:51.860
So Ashton Primary
doesn't have to get closed down.

57:51.902 --> 57:53.445
Come on, Henry, keep up.

57:53.487 --> 57:56.865
Can't we get the money
from somewhere else?

57:56.906 --> 58:00.285
- It's impossible to win 2 Cool 4 School.
- Henry.

58:00.327 --> 58:03.246
We're from Ashton Primary School.

58:03.288 --> 58:07.000
We don't know the meaning
ofthe word...impossible.

58:08.210 --> 58:10.962
Thanks, worm.
And what will you two be doing

58:11.003 --> 58:13.340
while l'm offwinning 2 Cool 4 School?

58:13.381 --> 58:17.302
l'm going to Brickhouse
to make sure Miss Lovely's all right.

58:17.343 --> 58:21.556
Oh, yeah. Miss Lovely.
Almost forgot about her.

58:21.598 --> 58:25.602
Well, don't almost forget to win
2 Cool 4 School tomorrow, will you?

58:27.770 --> 58:29.731
(chanting):
2 Cool 4 School...

58:29.772 --> 58:33.234
No-o-o-o-o-o-o!

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:10.081
Ah.

01:00:10.123 --> 01:00:14.752
He'd better, otherwise he's going to be
mashed up into tiny little pieces

01:00:14.794 --> 01:00:17.380
and fed to my piranha fish, OK?

01:00:17.422 --> 01:00:18.965

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:22.927
Yes, brave words, there,
from Henry's friends. And enemies.

01:00:22.968 --> 01:00:25.596
But he's gonna do it on his own now.

01:00:26.096 --> 01:00:29.684
How horrid do you think it's gonna be tonight,
Henry?

01:00:29.724 --> 01:00:31.269
Very horrid.

01:01:00.798 --> 01:01:04.468
l still don't understand how this is
going to save the school.

01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:05.553
Ssh!

01:01:05.594 --> 01:01:09.473
Don't worry, Mummy dearest.
No-one ever wins on 2 Cool 4 School.

01:01:09.515 --> 01:01:13.352
Henry, any idea who this week's
Terrible Teacher might be?

01:01:13.393 --> 01:01:15.062

And weaknesses.

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:28.242
MISS BATTLE-AXE:
Henry has always had three problems.

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:30.911
Homework, homework and homework.

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:33.539

01:02:21.628 --> 01:02:23.005
Ahhhh!

Time for you to do your homework, Henry.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:30.346
lf you used the excuse,
the cat ate your homework,

01:02:30.387 --> 01:02:33.098
3,999 times in a week...

01:02:34.391 --> 01:02:37.228
..how many times
did you use the excuse

01:02:37.268 --> 01:02:41.440
that you lost it
down the back ofthe sofa? Hm?

01:02:41.857 --> 01:02:43.651
Erm...but...

01:02:43.691 --> 01:02:46.195
that question doesn't make any sense.

01:02:46.612 --> 01:02:49.073
Precisely. (laughs wheezily)

01:02:49.114 --> 01:02:50.616

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:54.662
We still need an answer, Henry.

Too many?

01:03:33.867 --> 01:03:36.203
Next question, Henry.

01:03:36.244 --> 01:03:40.499
Which one ofthese
is not a nutritious snack?

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:43.293
A bowl ofworms.

(screams from audience)

01:03:49.382 --> 01:03:51.385
Or an Ashton Primary...

Come on, Henry, you can do it.

01:04:37.431 --> 01:04:41.601
Henry can eat a vegetable,
can't he, Vera-wera?

01:04:41.643 --> 01:04:45.272
- (baby retches)
- Henry's never eaten a vegetable.

01:04:48.025 --> 01:04:49.276

Oh, that looks disgusting, Henry.

(sniffs)

01:05:37.073 --> 01:05:39.284
l could eat three bowlfuls, Henry.

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:42.662
Ten seconds, Henry!

01:05:53.839 --> 01:05:55.759
Fang!

01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:02.015
Five seconds, Henry.

01:06:04.808 --> 01:06:06.186
Four...three...

01:06:08.188 --> 01:06:10.023
You'd better hop out.

01:06:11.483 --> 01:06:13.318
Aaagh!

01:06:13.859 --> 01:06:15.737
(cheering)

01:06:16.738 --> 01:06:18.406
How did he do that?

01:06:18.447 --> 01:06:20.408
He did it. Henry did it.

01:06:25.746 --> 01:06:28.458
He actually ate...a vegetable.

01:06:28.916 --> 01:06:31.002
- Go, Henry!
- (baby retches)

01:06:31.336 --> 01:06:34.547
Right, Henry. Complete this phrase.

01:06:36.841 --> 01:06:39.594
- Now you see it...
- Now you don't.

01:06:39.636 --> 01:06:41.679
BOTH:
Is the right answer!

01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:44.390
Which means it's time for...

01:06:44.973 --> 01:06:46.851
..the Bog...of...

01:06:46.893 --> 01:06:49.187
..Do-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-om!

01:06:49.228 --> 01:06:50.563

01:06:54.651 --> 01:06:56.402
(cackles)

01:06:58.987 --> 01:07:03.493
And remember, Henry, there's
only one way out ofthe Bog of Doom!

01:07:08.164 --> 01:07:10.500
Bye, Henry. Goodbye.

01:07:11.292 --> 01:07:13.670
Goodbye, Henry. (cackles)

Oh, it stinks! Yuk!

01:07:29.644 --> 01:07:30.770
Huh?

01:07:30.811 --> 01:07:33.231
''Pull to exit.''

01:08:56.395 --> 01:09:00.026
Hello, Peter. Come on in, boys.
We've been waiting for you.

01:09:00.066 --> 01:09:01.986
(laughs)

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:04.613
Whoa!

01:09:05.113 --> 01:09:07.283
(audience gasps)

01:09:08.117 --> 01:09:09.993
(quietly): Come on, Henry.

01:09:19.587 --> 01:09:20.712
(string snaps)

01:09:20.755 --> 01:09:22.089
(audience groans)

01:09:22.673 --> 01:09:25.091
(cheers)

01:09:26.676 --> 01:09:28.929
Oh, nice one, Henry.

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:31.307
Yeah, nice one, Henry.

01:09:31.346 --> 01:09:32.433
Yeah.

01:09:32.474 --> 01:09:35.185
Told you no-one ever wins on this show.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.729
Loser-r-r-r-r!

01:09:37.772 --> 01:09:39.732
Whoa-ho-ah!

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:43.068
What are you gonna do now, Henry?

01:09:56.081 --> 01:09:57.750
Henry!

01:09:57.791 --> 01:10:00.503
Try walking the magnetic moggy!

01:10:04.672 --> 01:10:05.966
Yes!

01:10:23.692 --> 01:10:25.194
Aagh!

01:10:32.408 --> 01:10:34.244
(cheering)

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:41.335
(chuckles)

01:10:41.377 --> 01:10:43.879
What does that horrid boy think he's doing?

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.090
That horrid boy is my big brother.

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:50.344
And he's saving the school,
if you really want to know.

01:10:50.386 --> 01:10:53.138
ls he now?
How exactly is he going to do that?

01:10:54.138 --> 01:10:56.809
- Boy at the end?
- He'll win the cash prize.

01:10:56.849 --> 01:10:59.186
- Next.
- So he can give it to Miss Oddbod.

01:10:59.228 --> 01:11:03.649
So she can pay the school inspectors
not to close our school.

01:11:03.689 --> 01:11:04.942
Oh.

01:11:04.983 --> 01:11:08.570
Hmm. What clever children you all are.

01:11:09.113 --> 01:11:11.323
But not nearly clever enough.

01:11:11.365 --> 01:11:15.744
Even ifthat horrid boy does win
the cash prize, it will be too late.

01:11:16.537 --> 01:11:18.539
What do you mean, Mr Van Wrinkle?

01:11:18.579 --> 01:11:20.666
What l mean, my lovely Miss Lovely,

01:11:20.707 --> 01:11:24.545
is that even as we speak,
Miss Oddbod is signing the papers

01:11:24.585 --> 01:11:27.047
that will close Ashton Primary forever.

01:11:27.089 --> 01:11:29.591
- (all gasp)
- Oh, yes.

01:11:31.884 --> 01:11:33.387
(laughs)

01:11:34.263 --> 01:11:37.015
Forever. Forever. Forever.

01:11:37.432 --> 01:11:39.351
(laughter on TV)

01:11:46.315 --> 01:11:48.569
Would you kindly
turn that racket down?

01:11:49.194 --> 01:11:51.863
Yes, Miss Oddbod.

01:11:51.904 --> 01:11:53.699
(both chuckle)

01:12:01.623 --> 01:12:03.583
So, Henry...

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:05.919
..one last homework question

01:12:05.961 --> 01:12:09.089
and you could be on your way
to meet the Terrible Teacher

01:12:09.131 --> 01:12:12.634
and win the big cash pri_e!

01:12:12.675 --> 01:12:14.344
(cheering on TV)

01:12:26.147 --> 01:12:29.568
Where does Miss Oddbod keep the key
to the Con_scation Cupboard?

01:12:30.276 --> 01:12:35.449
Oh, how l wish l could call Miss Oddbod
to tell her that you're all OK.

01:12:35.489 --> 01:12:38.952
Quiet! Can't you see
l'm trying to concentrate?

01:12:49.671 --> 01:12:51.256
The goldfish bowl.

01:12:51.297 --> 01:12:52.883
(both gasp)

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.718
Oh-h-h-h-h-h!

01:12:54.759 --> 01:12:56.595
(imitates pump)

01:12:56.636 --> 01:12:59.431
BOTH:
Is the right answer!

01:12:59.471 --> 01:13:01.349
(cheering)

01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:12.569
Go on, Henry. Open it.

01:13:23.704 --> 01:13:29.544
Yes, Henry, this is the Terrible Teacher's
Confiscation Cupboard.

01:13:30.128 --> 01:13:31.630
See anything you like?

01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:34.215
Yeah. l like all of it.

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:36.926
Cor, a Super Slimy Slammer.

01:13:38.803 --> 01:13:41.723
Oh, and the mightiest, Mighty Magnet!

01:13:42.766 --> 01:13:47.103
All ofthis...could be yours.

01:13:47.979 --> 01:13:49.272
lt could?

01:13:49.313 --> 01:13:50.523
All of it.

01:13:50.564 --> 01:13:54.277
But only if you give up the chance
to go to the Terrible Teacher's Omice.

01:13:54.319 --> 01:13:55.820
OK.

01:14:00.824 --> 01:14:02.285
Hang on.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:04.871
What about the big cash prize?

01:14:05.497 --> 01:14:07.665
Oh. Oh, yes.

01:14:07.707 --> 01:14:13.296
You also have to give up the chance
to win the big cash prize.

01:14:13.337 --> 01:14:15.799
Come on, boy.

01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:18.843
Let greed get the better of you.

01:14:18.884 --> 01:14:21.596
Have to hurry you, Henry.

01:14:21.637 --> 01:14:23.056
Don't do it, Henry.

01:14:23.096 --> 01:14:26.476
l'll give you all the pocket money
in the world if you don't do it.

01:14:26.518 --> 01:14:28.394
l can't believe you just said that.

01:14:29.228 --> 01:14:31.189
No, l can't do it.

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:33.066
(smattering of applause)

01:14:33.775 --> 01:14:36.945
Are you sure, Henry? Hmm?

01:14:39.072 --> 01:14:41.115
Yeah. l'm sure.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.868
(distant cheering)

01:14:44.494 --> 01:14:48.206
That boy is stupid as well as horrid.

01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:51.584
(laughs nervously)

01:14:55.672 --> 01:14:57.048
BOTH:
Oh.

01:15:00.843 --> 01:15:03.304
Congratulations, Henry.

01:15:03.345 --> 01:15:06.891
The big cash prize is within your reach.

01:15:08.226 --> 01:15:10.061
And now...

01:15:10.103 --> 01:15:12.355
it's time for you to meet...

01:15:16.693 --> 01:15:19.654
BOTH:
Terrible Teacher.

01:15:26.368 --> 01:15:27.453
Hello?

01:15:27.494 --> 01:15:28.955
(creaking)

01:15:28.996 --> 01:15:30.206
(door closes)

01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:37.171
Mr...er... Vic?

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:42.176
Would you mind running through
your fiendishly clever plan for us again?

01:15:42.217 --> 01:15:43.719
With pleasure.

01:15:44.679 --> 01:15:47.557
lt's all about greed at the end ofthe day.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:52.311
The school inspectors are greedy
but l, Vic Van Wrinkle,

01:15:52.352 --> 01:15:54.272
am even more greedy.

01:15:54.313 --> 01:15:58.192
OFcourse it was my brilliant idea
to set up Brickhouse School

01:15:58.234 --> 01:16:01.195
and then to close down
all the other schools round here

01:16:01.237 --> 01:16:05.658
so that everyone would pay me
Iots and lots of money to come here.

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.618
(chuckles)

01:16:12.414 --> 01:16:14.166
HENRY ON TV:
Hello?

01:16:15.417 --> 01:16:16.419
Hello?

01:16:16.459 --> 01:16:18.754
Oh, dear, l seem to have run out of ink.

01:16:18.795 --> 01:16:20.715
Would you get me some more?

01:16:20.755 --> 01:16:22.466
HENRY:
Hello?

01:16:22.508 --> 01:16:25.595
You'll find it in the cupboard
across the hall.

01:16:32.602 --> 01:16:34.395
Thank you.

01:16:38.107 --> 01:16:39.859
(ringing tone)

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.487
Hello, Police?
This is Ashton Primary School...

01:16:43.528 --> 01:16:45.489
Hello?

01:16:48.074 --> 01:16:49.702
Hello?

01:16:55.416 --> 01:16:57.585
Miss Battle-Axe, is that you?

01:16:59.502 --> 01:17:01.130
Yes, it is, Henry.

01:17:01.672 --> 01:17:03.340
You're the Terrible Teacher?

01:17:04.175 --> 01:17:06.635
You invited me on 2 Cool 4 School?

01:17:06.676 --> 01:17:10.765
Yes, indeed.
And it's time you were taught a lesson.

01:17:11.806 --> 01:17:13.934
Yes, Miss Battle-Axe.

01:17:13.975 --> 01:17:15.603
(clasps click)

01:17:18.481 --> 01:17:20.274
Oh...

01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:24.612
Not so fast, Henry.

01:17:26.113 --> 01:17:28.115
Now, where's your homework?

01:17:28.157 --> 01:17:29.783
Oh...

01:17:31.118 --> 01:17:33.204
Here, Miss Battle-Axe.

01:17:40.793 --> 01:17:42.296
Well...

01:17:43.087 --> 01:17:45.674
..it seems you have done
your homework, Henry.

01:17:46.967 --> 01:17:48.761
Wait.

01:17:49.427 --> 01:17:51.889
There seems to be a subject missing.

01:17:53.681 --> 01:17:56.560
What's that, Miss Battle-Axe?

01:17:56.601 --> 01:17:57.937
Spelling.

01:17:58.437 --> 01:17:59.939
Spelling?

01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:02.816
Yes, Henry.

01:18:04.067 --> 01:18:05.903
Just one word.

01:18:06.695 --> 01:18:09.949
- ''Homework.''
- Homework?

01:18:10.866 --> 01:18:14.370
Yes. How do you spell ''homework'', Henry?

01:18:15.328 --> 01:18:16.497
Erm...

01:18:17.705 --> 01:18:20.209
Come on, Henry.

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:25.005
H...O...

01:18:28.467 --> 01:18:30.803
(quietly): Come on, Henry.

01:18:30.843 --> 01:18:32.221
(quietly): l dunno.

01:18:33.262 --> 01:18:34.765
..erm...

01:18:35.557 --> 01:18:37.226
l am waiting.

01:18:38.184 --> 01:18:39.645
..M...E...

01:18:40.896 --> 01:18:43.690
All those spelling tests.

01:18:43.731 --> 01:18:48.695
All those weeks, months, years,
trying to teach you something.

01:18:50.364 --> 01:18:52.199
All that work, Henry.

01:18:52.241 --> 01:18:54.618
Now how do you spell work?

01:18:57.036 --> 01:18:59.081
W...E...

01:18:59.957 --> 01:19:01.667
..er...W...

01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:02.709
..E..

01:19:03.459 --> 01:19:05.379
W...O...

01:19:05.419 --> 01:19:07.005
..O...

01:19:08.422 --> 01:19:09.800
Oh, Henry.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.051
Huh?

01:19:11.093 --> 01:19:12.511
Oh, Henry.

01:19:12.802 --> 01:19:13.845
Oh.

01:19:13.886 --> 01:19:15.097
Oh, Henry.

01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:17.015
Oh.

01:19:18.433 --> 01:19:20.894
W-O-R-K.

01:19:22.353 --> 01:19:23.355
Homework.

01:19:23.396 --> 01:19:25.774
H-O-M-E...

01:19:26.692 --> 01:19:28.151
..W-O-R-K.

01:19:30.028 --> 01:19:33.031
That's how you spell homework,
Miss Battle-Axe.

01:19:33.073 --> 01:19:36.243
Oh...well done, Henry!

01:19:36.285 --> 01:19:37.869
l knew you could do it!

01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:39.496
(wild cheering)

01:19:43.333 --> 01:19:45.293
He did it!

01:19:45.334 --> 01:19:47.129
(squeals) He won!

01:19:47.169 --> 01:19:48.797
Yes!

01:19:49.798 --> 01:19:52.259
Well, well.

01:19:53.426 --> 01:19:55.846
Not so horrid after all.

01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:59.182
(sirens blare)

01:20:01.309 --> 01:20:03.270
Looks like we've got company.

01:20:03.311 --> 01:20:05.147
Sorry l can't stay to say hello.

01:20:07.982 --> 01:20:10.152
Missing you already.

01:20:10.192 --> 01:20:11.903
Aagh!

01:20:13.154 --> 01:20:14.448
(screeching tyres)

01:20:15.114 --> 01:20:16.491
(chuckles)

01:20:17.408 --> 01:20:19.369
Oh, dear. Whatever happened?

01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:23.290
l tied his shoelaces together, Miss Lovely.

01:20:23.331 --> 01:20:26.793
You horrid boy!

01:20:26.834 --> 01:20:28.336
(laughter)

01:20:29.463 --> 01:20:31.089
(cheering)

01:20:36.343 --> 01:20:38.388
Yes, yes, yes.

01:20:40.932 --> 01:20:43.768
Oh, for goodness sake!

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.899
Congratulations, Henry.

01:20:48.939 --> 01:20:52.903
You're only the second contestant ever
to win 2 Cool 4 School.

01:20:52.943 --> 01:20:54.404
Second?

01:20:55.488 --> 01:20:57.991
l thought no-one had ever won
2 Cool 4 School?

01:20:58.032 --> 01:21:02.662
Well, somebody did, a long, long time ago.

01:21:06.206 --> 01:21:10.462
lt was you. You won 2 Cool 4 School
a long, long time ago?

01:21:12.213 --> 01:21:13.340
Oh, wow.

01:21:13.714 --> 01:21:17.177
Come on, no time for a lovefest.
We've got a school to save.

01:21:17.218 --> 01:21:18.803
Miss Battle-Axe.

01:21:20.095 --> 01:21:21.681
No, no, wait. Come back!

01:21:21.806 --> 01:21:25.852
Oh, no, don't worry.
She's with me. Unfortunately.

01:21:32.233 --> 01:21:35.695
Hold up, snot face.
l won that money, after all.

01:21:35.736 --> 01:21:38.156
Yeah, l bet we'll never hear the end of it.

01:21:38.198 --> 01:21:41.159
''Look at me, l can spell homework.'' Big deal.

01:21:41.201 --> 01:21:44.204
Henry! You did it, Henry!

01:21:44.245 --> 01:21:46.122
You won 2 Cool 4 School!

01:21:46.163 --> 01:21:47.999
Don't get too excited, worm.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.501
Oh, shush.

01:21:52.419 --> 01:21:54.130
(police radios)

01:21:54.171 --> 01:21:56.174
Call yourselves school inspectors?

01:21:56.216 --> 01:22:00.094
The only thing you'll be inspecting
is a prison cell!

01:22:00.136 --> 01:22:01.471
Oh, children.

01:22:01.512 --> 01:22:04.849
Does that mean Ashton Primary
is not gonna get closed down?
