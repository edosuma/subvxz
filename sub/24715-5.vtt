When's the last time you saw her, Al?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.571
(EXHALES) Uh. At work, two days ago.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.823
She say what her plans were
for that night?

10:58.282 --> 11:00.368
(EXHALES) She was supposed
to come over for dinner,

11:00.451 --> 11:01.494
but then she canceled

11:01.577 --> 11:03.871
because her friend Brooke
was going through a break-up.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.748
-And Brooke's last name?
-AL: DeBoer.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.292
Did Angela say anything about going
to a place called the Time Bar?

11:08.959 --> 11:11.128
-No.
-And you never heard from Angela again?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.588
Th... that night, I did.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.132
-When?
-Uh. Midnight.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.885
-You called her?
-I went by her apartment.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.387
And?

11:19.762 --> 11:21.555
It's just... I... I hadn't heard from her,

11:21.764 --> 11:23.891
and she wasn't answering her phone,
so I went by.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.726
-What'd you guys talk about?
-AL: Nothing.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.645
I... I just made sure she was okay.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.647
She said
she wasn't feeling well, and, uh...

11:30.106 --> 11:31.565
she'd call me tomorrow,
so I went home.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.859
She looked all right?
She wasn't nervous about anything?

11:34.610 --> 11:37.071
I didn't... actually see her.

-something's up.

goes to school with his son.

two nights ago?

12:57.359 --> 12:59.528
Yeah, we went to the Time Bar
to have some drinks.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.323
And Angela was consoling you
over some break-up?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.367
No, that's what she told
her boyfriend, Al.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.746
-She just wanted to go out.
-How long were you at the bar?

(INHALES) ...Angela said,

13:15.586 --> 13:18.756
"Don't look now, but there's this cute guy
flirting with me at the bar."

13:19.215 --> 13:20.883

-BROOKE: Yeah.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.720

He was probably about 30,
nice hair, cute.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.726
And then Angela called me
a little before midnight

13:30.810 --> 13:33.521
from her apartment.
She told me they had sex.

13:33.771 --> 13:34.772
She mention his name?

13:35.064 --> 13:37.399

she said "Rich."

-No, he was using the bathroom.

She didn't seem scared or agitated?

13:55.918 --> 13:58.379
No, after she told me he had a small unit,

13:58.462 --> 14:00.214
she kind of laughed
and said she had to go.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.800
Were Angela and her boyfriend,
Al, having problems?

14:03.092 --> 14:06.011
No... I mean,
Angela's getting kind of restless

14:06.095 --> 14:08.556
'cause Al's just too nice.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.350
So this guy, Rich, she took home...

about leaving me out of this

told us not to play junior detective.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.441
Yeah, right.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.568
But when we deal
with each other again, Dennis,

21:18.652 --> 21:20.570
you're gonna keep your voice down
just like we've been doing.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.122
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

21:30.414 --> 21:31.456
Thanks.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.127
We, uh, we checked
the distributor of the vodka

21:35.210 --> 21:37.629
that was on the keychain
given to the waitress. Nothing.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.756
Andy's on with the manufacturer
of the keychain,

21:39.881 --> 21:41.758
seeing if they've had a sales rep
posted in the city.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.344
-When did the inspector call?
-Uh. Two minutes ago.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.638
IRVIN: 15th squad.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.890
I'm checking to see
if any of your sales reps

21:48.974 --> 21:51.977
have any territory out here,
maybe somebody named Rich.

21:52.602 --> 21:55.355
Yeah. Uh. Yeah, uh, Weckerlee?
How do you spell that?

21:56.356 --> 21:57.858
And, uh, how old is Rich?

21:58.734 --> 22:01.945
Nah. He's not wanted for a crime,
just as a possible witness.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.239
Yeah. And how would I get ahold of him?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.283
ANDY: Great.
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.701
-(TELEPHONE BEEPS)
-ANDY: Mm-hmm. Bye.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.912
-Rich Weckerlee, 31, currently in town.
-Get him in.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.665
Oh, and Diane,
if you're gonna work another case,

22:13.749 --> 22:15.834
you need to notify me
so when your boss calls,

22:16.001 --> 22:17.252
I don't look like an idiot
that don't know where you were.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.046
(SIGHS) I'll worry about my boss.
You worry about your detectives.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.255
How about that?

22:21.590 --> 22:24.551
(INHALES) You work out of my squad,
you notify me what's going on.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.845
-End of conversation. You hear me?
-Fine.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.556
Get this guy in here.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.852
Take care of it.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.235
(DOOR CLOSING)

22:42.402 --> 22:43.945
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.907
So going off on the boss,
that's coming from nothing?

22:47.532 --> 22:50.577
(SIGHS) I have just got
a lot of things on my mind.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.374
Diane, we've known
each other for ten years now.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.084
We've helped each other through a lot.

22:57.501 --> 23:01.046
-I can help you with this, whatever it is.
-There's nothing to tell you.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.882
You don't want me knowing, then okay.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.967
But this isn't some
Petty Larceny case we're working,

23:06.134 --> 23:07.719
and if you're not up for it,
then take some days off

23:07.969 --> 23:09.888
or get reassigned
'cause I'm not gonna have you

23:10.013 --> 23:12.849
-blowing this thing.
-I'm not dropping off this case, Andy.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.267
Then get it together.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.061
I will.

23:20.357 --> 23:21.358
(DOOR CLOSING)

23:26.321 --> 23:27.656
Kurt?

23:28.782 --> 23:29.825
He's been grounded.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.660
What's wrong, Mom?

23:32.119 --> 23:34.204
They have a question for Kurt.
Go back to your room.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.417
The detectives have found a suspect
in that arson fire, sweetheart,

23:38.500 --> 23:40.210
but they have
a follow-up question for you.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.045
So who did the arson?

23:42.170 --> 23:43.547
Uh. We believe it's a homeless man

23:43.672 --> 23:45.006
that's been living illegally
in the building.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.425
-(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)
-Oh.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.094
You see, we're putting
the finishing touches on this whole thing,

23:49.177 --> 23:51.680
but, uh, a problem that's come up
is the market owner

23:51.763 --> 23:52.806
you bought the lighter from.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.808
Now, he swears he saw you
with another kid your age.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.394
See, that leaves us
with a discrepancy in our report

23:57.477 --> 24:00.063
and, uh... (SCOFFS)
...we can't get our boss to sign off

24:00.147 --> 24:03.024
-right until that discrepancy's explained.
-Yeah, it's understandable

24:03.108 --> 24:05.193
if you left your friend's name off
when we talked to you earlier.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.654
But now we need to know who you were with,
so this can be done with.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.157
Were you with someone, Kurt?

24:11.908 --> 24:12.993
Tell the truth.

24:15.829 --> 24:16.830
Ray Spier.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.916
But we didn't go anywhere
near that building or light that fire.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.378
Okay, but when we leave here,
everything gets official,

24:23.462 --> 24:25.130
-so if you're leaving anything out...
-Um...

24:25.338 --> 24:27.007
I believe you got what you came for.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.009
So, we're done.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.345
-Okay.
-We're sorry for any inconvenience.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.973
Oh, this homeless person's
gonna be prosecuted?

24:35.348 --> 24:36.349
Absolutely.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.435
Well. Good.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.571
Sit down.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.865
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

24:52.782 --> 24:55.452
-How often you in town?
-A couple days a week.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.662
-Am I in some sort of trouble here?
-JOHN: I don't know.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.248
-Did you do something wrong?
-No, not at all.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.835
-Were you at the Time Bar two nights ago?
-I stopped by for a drink, yeah.

25:04.669 --> 25:05.754
Did you meet an Angela Pratt?

25:06.755 --> 25:08.173
No, I don't know who that is.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.472
-Is this a joke?
-Did you go home with her?

25:16.932 --> 25:18.767
It's not that complicated
a question, Rich.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.686
I walked her home.
She asked me to. She was drunk.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.064
This is surreal.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.274
-Did you go inside?
-Briefly.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.902
Did you have sex? Rich?

25:29.236 --> 25:32.364
No, we didn't have sex.
This poor woman, my God.

25:32.447 --> 25:33.823
-You married, Rich?
-Yes.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.825
Is that why you won't admit
you had sex with Angela?

25:35.992 --> 25:36.993
We did not have sex.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.412
Then how come she told her girlfriend
that you got a small dick?

25:39.579 --> 25:41.289
Or were you wearing a T-shirt that said,
"Hey, ladies, guess what?"

25:41.498 --> 25:43.124
-(RICH SCOFFS)
-"I got a small dick."

25:43.583 --> 25:46.419
-This is surreal.
-ANDY: No, this is real. Angela's dead.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.505
You were the last one seen with her.

25:48.588 --> 25:52.050
And you have been lying
about what you two did in that apartment.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.428
-Something go wrong?
-No.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.640
That's it? That's your response
to being asked if you killed somebody?

25:59.057 --> 26:01.184
This is bizarre.
I... I don't even know what to say.

26:01.268 --> 26:04.312
Rich! Get back in the room here, pal.
Your life is on the line.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.817
We had sex.

26:09.442 --> 26:12.904
But I didn't kill her.
My God, just saying those words out loud.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.864
-When did you leave?
-RICH: Midnight, I think.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.742
Her boyfriend started knocking
on the door, she made him go away.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.662
I waited, like, ten minutes,
then I went back to my hotel.

26:20.829 --> 26:21.871
What happened, Rich?

26:22.455 --> 26:25.041
-Nothing.
-Were you drunk? Did she make fun of you?

26:26.001 --> 26:28.545
-This is surreal.
-Oh. Let's see how surreal it is

26:28.628 --> 26:30.547
when we tell your wife
you were cheating on her!

26:33.842 --> 26:35.260
I didn't kill that woman!

26:36.094 --> 26:38.680
And at this point, I'm gonna
have to ask to talk to my attorney.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.150
-(DOOR CLOSING)
-Busy day.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.444
I was sick.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.112
Did you get out at all?

26:54.946 --> 26:57.949
I went with my friend Kurt Ackerman
to try and buy some cigarettes,

26:58.033 --> 27:00.285
but the guy ID'd Kurt,
so we just went straight home.

27:00.827 --> 27:03.955
(INHALES) You know, in the future,
Ray, try and tell your story

27:04.039 --> 27:05.957
without it sounding so rehearsed.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.584
Well, that's what happened.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.255
-You can't do that.
-It'll be our little secret.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.134
Where's the tape?

27:16.801 --> 27:17.802
Lost it.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.056
(SIGHS) Obviously, uh...

27:22.140 --> 27:23.850
you and Kurt have been in communication,

27:24.225 --> 27:27.937
so, uh, I know that he must have told you
that we got a homeless guy in custody,

27:28.146 --> 27:31.274
and that all we needed was to find out
who Kurt was hanging out with

27:31.399 --> 27:34.319
so we could close our reports,
and that's why he gave us your name.

27:35.236 --> 27:36.363
Well, guess what?

27:36.905 --> 27:37.906
We lied.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.658
You see, there was
a homeless guy in the building.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.576
But he's not our suspect,
he's our witness.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.995
He saw you and Kurt go in there,
and a little while later,

27:44.079 --> 27:46.247
-the fire started.
-GREG: But Kurt has an alibi.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.291
He was at home when that fire went up,

27:48.750 --> 27:51.127
and that leaves you, Ray,
all by your lonesome.

27:53.588 --> 27:56.633
(EXHALES) Look, Kurt was there too.
He chickened out,

27:56.716 --> 27:58.176
so I lit the fire and he filmed it,
but he was not there.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.428
Mm-hmm. No. Kurt's mom
saw him home at 10:30.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.554
There's no way he could have been there.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.849
Oh, she's lying. (SCOFFS)
She's the one that told us to lie.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.268
Kurt's mom is behind all this?

28:08.269 --> 28:11.231
We tried to put the fire out,
but it got to some newspapers

28:11.314 --> 28:13.274
and flared up,
so we booked it back to Kurt's.

28:13.858 --> 28:18.321
Then Mrs. Ackerman saw how amped we were
and saw our clothes and smelled the smoke,

28:18.405 --> 28:21.366
and she knew something was up,
so Kurt had to tell her what happened.

28:21.658 --> 28:22.992
Did Kurt's dad know?

28:23.702 --> 28:24.703
Probably. (SCOFFS)

28:25.328 --> 28:27.789
He's afraid of Mrs. Ackerman too.
That whole family is.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.249
Where's the videotape?

28:29.749 --> 28:32.043
Mrs. Ackerman burned it
in their fireplace.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.005
(CHUCKLES) That lady is crazy.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.508
I mean, she looks
kind of pretty and cooks good

28:38.591 --> 28:40.885
and drives a nice car, but she's crazy.

28:42.846 --> 28:43.888
All right.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.391
Let's go.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.488
NANCY: Kurt? The detectives are back.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.823
GREG: Look at that.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.372
We talked to Ray Spier.
He told us what happened.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.458
They tried buying cigarettes,
then came home.

29:11.624 --> 29:12.959
That's incorrect and you know it.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.379
He lit the fire, Kurt filmed it,
it got out of control,

29:16.671 --> 29:18.923
they came home, you told them to lie,

29:19.382 --> 29:20.759
then you burned the tape.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.510
Ray Spier is the one who's lying.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.096
He's a no-good thug
who's been a bad influence on Kurt.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.890
GREG: You can work that out later
with your lawyer.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.768
But for now,
you and Kurt are under arrest.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.062
Now, we do this calmly,
we won't have to put you in cuffs.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.814
Under arrest? For what?

29:35.148 --> 29:37.525
Arson. Hindering prosecution.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.779
Okay, listen, it was very hectic.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.906
I knew this would go
on Kurt's permanent record

29:42.989 --> 29:45.200
and hurt his chance at college,
so we fibbed a little.

29:46.701 --> 29:48.703
-Do either of you have children?
-BALDWIN: All right, let's go, ma'am.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.164
(EXHALES) Are you happy?

29:51.456 --> 29:53.875
-Now, I'm getting arrested!
-Mom, calm down. We'll get a lawyer.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.543
Are you happy now, Kurt?

29:55.627 --> 29:58.087
Miss Ackerman, you need to calm down,
or we'll have to put you in cuffs.

He was at the security desk
when Rich Weckerlee came into the hotel

30:34.999 --> 30:37.377
and went to his room.
He puts it around 12:20.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.712
He said that, uh,
Rich seemed a little drunk,

30:39.879 --> 30:40.922
but that's about it.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.882
He's not looking like our guy, boss.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.301
Was Rich in town when your DOA was killed?

30:45.385 --> 30:47.929
He said he was home in Jersey.
We can check it if you want,

30:48.012 --> 30:50.640
but these murders are so similar,
it has to be the same guy in both.

30:50.723 --> 30:53.268
Yeah. If Rich didn't do ours,
it's doubtful he did the other one.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.228
Plus, the pattern
isn't public knowledge yet,

30:55.311 --> 30:56.729
so there wouldn't be a copycat.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.524
It's hitting the papers tomorrow.
The <i>Daily News </i>is running it.

30:59.899 --> 31:02.652
Oh, good. Maybe,
it'll generate some information coming in.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.195
All right, we got a set-up
on the bar tonight,

31:04.279 --> 31:05.405
everybody who's available.

31:05.613 --> 31:09.409
-Uh. Let me work on getting a sitter.
-Uh. Don't worry. I got Rita and Diane.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.705
-Okay.
-I mean, that is if you can fit it

31:13.830 --> 31:15.206
-into your schedule.
-I'll be there.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.375
There's two bars at the hotel.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.670
Rita, you, Greg, and Baldwin
take the rooftop bar.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.340
Diane, Andy, and John take the Time Bar.
Meet up there at 8:00.

31:24.424 --> 31:27.302
And, uh, we'll be doing this every night
till we catch this guy.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.638
Where's the mom and the son?

31:31.347 --> 31:34.183
