00:47.000 --> 00:48.920
SUPERMAN
RIDE OF STEEL

01:32.120 --> 01:34.240
-Did something happen to Isabel?
-No.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.160
We don't see each other in years
and you turn up here at 6am.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Are you making me wait
until a more convenient time?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
No, come in.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.120
-Let me put some pants on.
-Not on my account.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.320
A man in his underwear
doesn't scare me.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
I'm sure.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.600
I liked you for my daughter,
you know?

02:00.600 --> 02:03.200
She never shut up
about her partner.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.640
You really helped her
when she started.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.160
In every sense.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.080
Now she can't even look at me.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.080
-Would you like a coffee?
-No, thanks.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.680
What's this?

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
Nothing.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.800
I'm working out
if the killer has a pattern.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.560
-Have you got anything?
-I can't talk about it.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.160
Right, I know how it is.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.760
I don't want to bother you.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.400
But you're the only one
who can help me.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.120
You must get Isabel
away from this.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.080
So much for not bothering me.

02:43.240 --> 02:47.000
You're in the wrong place.
It's not up to me.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.680
-A cop has his ways.
-And a psychiatrist doesn't?

02:50.880 --> 02:53.000
It's not the same,
you know that.

02:53.680 --> 02:57.520
What do you want?
For me to go behind her back?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.160
She doesn't sleep.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.720
She's losing things,

03:03.880 --> 03:06.000
she can't remember
where she parked her car.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.000
She's a mess.
Can't you see that?

03:14.280 --> 03:16.720
-You don't have kids?
-Not that I know of...

03:19.680 --> 03:22.000
Then you can't possibly know
how I feel.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.000
When you have a child,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.080
your sole purpose in life
is to keep them safe.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.840
I would give anything to help
her right now, but I can't.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.040
Do whatever you have to.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.120
But get my daughter
off this case.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.320
You got fat.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.840
And you're going bald.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.640
So, what is it that is so urgent
after all this time?

06:11.800 --> 06:14.560
-The vacancy at your precinct.
-The inspector role?

06:14.720 --> 06:16.360
I've got just the person.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.120
-Who?
-Isabel Mora.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.920
-Mora?
-She's an excellent cop.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.560
Sorry, I don't take
anyone's leftovers.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.640
Your boss's idea?

06:30.120 --> 06:31.120
Mine.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.480
We don't do charity in this job.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.640
That girl is trouble right now.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.000
See you in another five years.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.000
It won't be that long.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.280
You sure of that?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.520
Nice try,
but you're stuck with her.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.320
Remember that stash
you found in La Barranquilla?

07:05.320 --> 07:06.800
You weren't in that unit.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.000
I read the reports.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.000
Forty kilos of hash
inexplicably became fifteen.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.080
I'm not great at math
but I'm missing 25.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.560
You wouldn't want
that accounting error

07:19.720 --> 07:22.040
coming out now,
Commissioner Medina.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.200
Any news?

07:29.040 --> 07:30.960
-Nothing.
-Nieto! Isabel!

07:38.000 --> 07:41.720
We have a meeting 9am tomorrow,
Department of the Interior.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.120
What for?

07:43.120 --> 07:43.160
What for?
They were pretty brief
but I'll translate for you.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.120
They were pretty brief
but I'll translate for you.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.280
They're questioning our ability
to work this case.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.960
So, they've called us in
to screw us over.

07:53.080 --> 07:57.600
Nieto, the only progress
we've made is being on trash TV.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.480
-You don't have to remind her.
-You don't have to defend me.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.480
You don't get
how serious this is.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.160
I don't have to prove
I can do my job.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.000
But I do.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.600
We're going to do
a full presentation

08:10.720 --> 08:12.760
of our lines of inquiry,
if that's okay.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.080
So they can't fault us.

08:14.080 --> 08:14.160
So they can't fault us.
-Oh, they will.
-Well, we'll see.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.200
-Oh, they will.
-Well, we'll see.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.560
Commissioner Medina?
What does he want now?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.240
-Let's go.
-Hi, Andrés.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.720
I have a lot at stake
so I want us to do our homework.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.040
If you intend to do nothing,
tell me now.

08:30.520 --> 08:31.920
-Did you hear me?
-Yes.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.120
Right.

08:33.560 --> 08:37.120
I'll put together a presentation
with photos, documentation...

08:37.320 --> 08:39.800
so they can see it all...
clear as day.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.720
-Will they have a projector?
-I guess so.

08:45.240 --> 08:48.880
I just spoke to Andrés Medina,
Central District Commissioner.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.400
He asked for an inspector
who's an expert in analyti--

08:52.520 --> 08:54.640
Well, he asked
specifically for you.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.560
-Inspector?
-Inspector.

09:00.760 --> 09:01.760
When?

09:01.920 --> 09:03.280
To start immediately.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.000
There's movement
at an abandoned industrial park.

09:10.000 --> 09:10.040
There's movement
at an abandoned industrial park.
We got a call
reporting suspicious noises.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.120
We got a call
reporting suspicious noises.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.000
Hello.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Mom?

10:24.440 --> 10:25.600
I'm going to take it.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.120
I'm glad.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.600
So am I.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.720
It'll be good for you.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.880
It'll be good for everyone.

10:43.920 --> 10:44.920
Well...

10:45.760 --> 10:48.600
Looks like this is our last
awkward silence together.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.120
Is that my mom? Pull over.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.800
Mom?

11:07.720 --> 11:11.080
What are you doing
coming out of this hostel?

11:11.280 --> 11:12.360
Nothing.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.000
Seeing a friend.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.000
-What?
-She's separated

11:17.000 --> 11:17.040
-What?
-She's separated
and she's come to live here.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.720
and she's come to live here.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.360
To this dive? What friend?

11:21.560 --> 11:23.560
Honey,
what's with the third degree?

11:23.760 --> 11:24.760
It's just strange.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.640
Has she got money problems

11:26.800 --> 11:29.160
or... maybe she's hiding
from her husband?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.920
She's fine, don't overthink it.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.040
I have a class to get to.
Look after yourself.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.240
There's a way in through here.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.040
Come on.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.720
Freeze! Police!

13:07.120 --> 13:10.040
-How many are there?
-There's a full truck outside.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.000
We don't know
how many are out there already.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.120
The people are making
a murderer their hero.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.280
A murderer.
What is the world coming to?

13:20.440 --> 13:22.960
They're reacting
to what they see as injustice.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.480
No, Nieto, no.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.320
Take them and burn the lot.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.560
The idea is out there

13:28.720 --> 13:31.000
you can't control
how people think.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.760
I'm not trying to be
the Thought Police.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.560
Yes, I've read Orwell, too.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.760
I haven't.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.440
-But I saw the movie.
-It doesn't end well.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.600
So, burn the lot.
And another thing.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.280
LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING
STUCK WITH ISABEL

14:18.440 --> 14:21.200
I DON'T OWE YOU SHIT ANYMORE
GO TO HELL

15:26.240 --> 15:27.240
Witch.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.000
She's under my control now.
I watch her every move.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.560
Her house is my house.
Her eyes, my eyes.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.120
You left me empty
all these years.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.320
I feel nothing.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.400
I'm the victim. Not you.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.160
You've stripped me
of my essence.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.200
You've castrated me.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.560
You've taken everything.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.560
It's awful
to live unstimulated.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.400
Awful.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.560
Just let it be, girl.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.480
When I was nine,
I asked my mom about my dad.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.040
She said he was a guy
from her school

16:20.160 --> 16:21.840
who wanted nothing
to do with me.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.080
So you think you'll find the
truth in her diary.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.560
It'll just be full of crap.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.120
ISA & SERGIO FOREVER

16:30.040 --> 16:31.080
Sergio Renedo.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.520
It says
he's the love of her life.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.080
What if my dad
did want to know me?

16:40.440 --> 16:42.640
What if my mom's lying
about that, too?

16:44.240 --> 16:46.040
She hides everything from me.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.040
I'm tired of it.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.280
I'm going to find out
and take control of my life.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.640
Okay, it was Sergio, who?

16:54.480 --> 16:55.760
Are you searching for him?

16:57.480 --> 16:58.440
Renedo.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.160
Look.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.080
PLEASE WASH YOUR OWN DISHES

17:11.240 --> 17:12.360
Goddammit.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.040
Morning.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.880
What the hell is that?

17:26.600 --> 17:29.120
This? There's a box full
in the warehouse.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.000
-Want one?
-Where are you from?

17:31.640 --> 17:33.240
IT department. I'm new here.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.600
That's damn clear.
Take that off right now.

17:36.920 --> 17:37.920
Okay.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.400
It's just... I have to get this
to Isabel Mora.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.040
-Could you...?
-What is it?

17:44.040 --> 17:44.080
-Could you...?
-What is it?
Data she needs
for tomorrow's presentation.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.760
Data she needs
for tomorrow's presentation.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.160
-Her?
-She won't be there.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.800
What did you offer him?

17:52.480 --> 17:55.560
What did you offer him?
Your buddy must owe you big time

17:55.720 --> 17:57.200
to get stuck with Isabel Mora.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.720
-Hang on, I think...
-No, shut your mouth

18:00.880 --> 18:02.880
or I'll knock your teeth out.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.160
Well, then you won't understand
what I'm about to tell you.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.520
You're making a mistake
not taking that job.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.000
Who are you
to meddle in my life?

18:13.800 --> 18:15.800
-I won't justify what I do.
-No.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.440
But I won't let you
manipulate me.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.800
You're nobody.
You hear? You're nobody.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.280
I do what I think is right.
And always have.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.400
I'm not about to change now.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.800
You're early.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.920
I know the area well.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.760
I work it a lot.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.440
Wow.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.360
Such elegance.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.640
-So luxurious.
-Save the tour for afterwards.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.280
-Should I undress or...?
-No, don't.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.440
Lie down. On your back.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.440
-Is this alright?
-Don't speak.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.160
Close your eyes.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.200
Eyes closed.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.080
You're asleep.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.720
Eyes closed.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.040
Don't move.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.360
Don't blink.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.600
Close your eyes, dammit.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.760
-If you tell me what you want...
-You have to be asleep.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.640
It's not that complicated.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.040
Sleep.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.480
Not complicated.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.320
Come on.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.080
Get out.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.360
-What did I do?
-Get out, now.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.000
I can do
whatever you want me to.

21:02.000 --> 21:02.080
I can do
whatever you want me to.
Just go.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.120
Just go.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.560
Holy shit, you scared me!

21:37.720 --> 21:39.480
You could have just called.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.480
I was interested in meeting you.

21:41.640 --> 21:42.760
It's not mutual.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.720
You're the one who came to me.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.760
What can I do for you?

21:49.960 --> 21:52.680
I won't ask about your morals,
it's clear you don't have any.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.080
And it's clear you don't care.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.480
As a woman,
you know what you've done.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.640
Well...

21:59.040 --> 22:01.160
-Firstly, I'm a reporter...
-Firstly, you're a witch.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.880
Don't you realize
I'm selling you as a heroine?

22:05.960 --> 22:08.360
Getting over your trauma,
defending your attacker.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.200
Even fulfilling your duty
as a cop

22:10.360 --> 22:11.800
when you shouldn't be
on the case.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.400
What more do you want?

22:15.040 --> 22:17.720
For you
to stop talking about me.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.600
What if I don't?
You'll report me?

22:21.080 --> 22:23.480
Do you really want
to add fuel to the fire?

22:23.680 --> 22:24.760
I don't recommend it.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.640
That's coming
from a media professional.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.160
Some reporter. Such insight.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.400
Right.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.600
Let's do something.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.720
What if you told your story?

22:40.840 --> 22:43.240
Your version of events.
The platform is there.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.840
Whenever you like. Listen.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.080
You know I have a gun, right?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.040
You're aware of that?

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
I am.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.680
I also see your hands shaking.
So we're done here.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.160
I'm about to go live.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.400
Think about my offer.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.560
Come on!

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
Open up.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.880
Come on, open the door!

24:43.880 --> 24:45.360
It's a public restroom, man!

24:47.360 --> 24:50.560
-What's going on?
-I've been waiting here an hour.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.400
So open it.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.320
Open it.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.200
Come on, please.
Just open the door!

25:02.360 --> 25:03.360
Isabel.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.280
-Are you alright?
-Hey, are you okay?

25:09.160 --> 25:10.520
Can you hear me?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.840
-Can you hear me, Isabel?
-Can you hear me?

25:33.080 --> 25:35.440
This guy took revenge
on a rival drug gang

25:35.640 --> 25:37.960
by burying their wives
and daughters alive.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.320
How poetic.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.320
Have you got it?

25:45.400 --> 25:46.760
"Time served."

25:53.160 --> 25:54.680
What an animal.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.040
Which one,
the killer or this bastard?

25:57.680 --> 25:59.960
They'll love that
at the DoI tomorrow.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.920
Goddammit!

26:03.320 --> 26:04.720
These are suede, dammit!

26:06.520 --> 26:08.200
Oh look, here she comes.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.400
-I'm working.
-That's great.

26:24.440 --> 26:28.160
Your dear friend Isabel came
to see me all revved up.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.240
What did you expect?

26:29.680 --> 26:31.680
Not that she'd threaten
me with a gun.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.640
-Sounds like she didn't use it.
-No.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.280
She just threw up on my shoes.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.560
She threw up? Isabel?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.680
Isabel threw up, that's right.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.800
She was slumped in
the parking lot restroom, okay?

26:44.960 --> 26:46.120
She looked like shit.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.040
She's taking something,
I'm sure.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.920
Don't put that on me too.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.840
I have to go.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.640
Asshole.

27:14.560 --> 27:17.440
-You look like shit.
-Matching with my surroundings.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.400
-Approximate time of the murder?
-They're on it.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.120
Great.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.560
I'll sort things for tomorrow.
You take a break.

27:30.760 --> 27:33.080
No. I'm absolutely fine.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.640
I'll deal with the presentation.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.640
You just turn up on time.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.720
Very well.
We'll meet at the precinct then.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.120
-That way you can supervise me.
-Sounds good.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.240
Hey, I'll have a gin and tonic.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.080
Rough day?

28:47.040 --> 28:49.480
The worst.
I just left my lawyer's office.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.920
I had a tough divorce, too.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.240
Kids?

28:56.800 --> 28:58.760
Two. Twelve and seven.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.440
Bad ages.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.040
I have three, they're older.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.360
They got used to it.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.800
-Two more.
-No.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.360
-I don't really drink.
-You deserve it today.

29:16.760 --> 29:17.840
Ain't that the truth.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.520
I need to change lawyer.
This one's too soft.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.960
She concedes to
everything he asks for.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.760
A measly alimony after years
of putting up with him.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.000
Dealing with his bullshit,
his cheating...

29:35.080 --> 29:36.960
I'll grab them. Excuse me.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.120
Thanks. Keep the change.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.600
Here you go.
And custody?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.800
He's not interested.
Dad of the year.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.720
If you like...

30:05.480 --> 30:07.760
I can put you in touch
with my ex's lawyer.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.520
A real bulldog.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.360
I expect you deserved it, right?

30:13.400 --> 30:14.800
-Maybe.
-I'm sorry.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
No, it's fine. Cheers.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.480
-I didn't mean it.
-Cheers.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.880
Cheers.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.400
This is going
straight to my head.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.640
It's been an emotional day.

30:37.840 --> 30:38.800
Are you alright?

30:40.880 --> 30:41.880
I feel weird.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.680
I'm going to head
to the restroom, okay?

30:47.800 --> 30:49.000
-Yes.
-Don't go anywhere.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.560
Shit! Shit! Shit!

32:51.120 --> 32:52.080
PAROT CASE.
PRESENTATION

32:52.240 --> 32:55.440
FOR THE DEPARTMENT
OF THE INTERIOR

33:02.560 --> 33:05.840
Guys, quit hanging around
to talk to girls at the end.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.160
Don't make them feel important.
We should finish and split.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.000
Let's go grab a beer,
we've earned it.

33:21.480 --> 33:22.480
Sergio.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.240
Hold up a sec, guys.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.680
-Hey.
-Hello.

33:31.120 --> 33:34.120
You don't know me,
but I know you.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.120
You were my mom's boyfriend
in high school.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.320
My name's Sol.

33:39.640 --> 33:42.040
What high school? What...?
Who's your mom?

33:42.680 --> 33:44.280
Sorry, I'm not making sense.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.240
Okay, Isabel Mora, my mom...

33:48.120 --> 33:50.440
-You're Sergio Renedo, right?
-Yes.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.960
Well... I'm your daughter.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.120
Isabel was your girlfriend.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.080
Right, of course. Isabel.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.520
-How is she?
-Now you're interested?

34:10.600 --> 34:13.440
-How could you turn your...?
-Wait. What's she told you?

34:13.600 --> 34:15.440
I'm not your dad.
It's impossible.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.120
I thought...

34:21.040 --> 34:22.760
if you saw me, you'd change.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.640
You'd want to get to know me.
I was stupid.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.880
I used to imagine
what you'd be like.

34:30.680 --> 34:33.080
Listen.
You seem like a nice kid,

34:33.080 --> 34:33.160
Listen.
You seem like a nice kid,
but I can't be anyone's father.

34:33.160 --> 34:35.200
but I can't be anyone's father.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.280
-Right.
-Let me finish.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.760
I can't have kids.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.040
Are you impotent?

34:44.240 --> 34:46.360
Sterile. I'm sterile.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.120
You can't be my daughter.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.080
Sergio, let's go.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.400
Your mom dropped out
of school suddenly overnight.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.720
I never heard from her again.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.560
I'm sorry.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.240
I'm not going to a wedding.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.280
Or a convent.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.040
What?

37:20.480 --> 37:22.880
-It's Nieto.
-I know. What do you want?

37:23.280 --> 37:25.600
I know we said
we'd meet at the precinct

37:26.120 --> 37:29.080
but I'm going straight there,
I have to go to the bank.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.400
-Does it have to be today?
-Yes, it does.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.440
Okay, right.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.320
I'll go straight from my place
to the DoI, then.

37:39.280 --> 37:42.400
I need you to go to the precinct
and pick up some files.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.120
Files? Today?

37:44.120 --> 37:44.160
Files? Today?
Yes, find the case file
on the Usera subway murder.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.240
Yes, find the case file
on the Usera subway murder.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.760
-Why do we need that?
-It's a case we closed quickly.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.760
What's it to do
with the presentation?

37:54.920 --> 37:56.600
We don't know
where they'll come at us from.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.960
Best be prepared.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.000
Plus, we have to show them
we know how to do our job well.

38:02.000 --> 38:02.040
Plus, we have to show them
we know how to do our job well.
The presentation is perfect,
no loose ends.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.320
The presentation is perfect,
no loose ends.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.400
I don't doubt it,
but we should cover ourselves.

38:09.880 --> 38:10.880
Okay.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.520
Fine.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.160
POLICE STATION

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Subway...

38:59.080 --> 39:00.160
Usera.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.160
No way.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.640
For god's sake.
You've got to be shitting me!

40:37.000 --> 40:41.080
Agent Isabel Mora was raped
by one of the parot ex-cons

41:26.120 --> 41:27.200
No.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.040
No. No.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.560
Damn. No.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.240
Please!

41:39.960 --> 41:41.080
Please!

41:42.000 --> 41:44.160
Please, open the door!

41:45.080 --> 41:50.800
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

42:06.200 --> 42:07.600
Wasn't Isabel with you?

42:08.120 --> 42:11.120
I had an errand to run
and I asked her to get the file

42:11.240 --> 42:14.080
on the Usera subway murder
to include it.

42:14.080 --> 42:14.160
on the Usera subway murder
to include it.
Call her, find out where she is.

42:14.160 --> 42:16.120
Call her, find out where she is.

42:45.160 --> 42:48.000
So, Isabel is the only one
with all the material,

42:48.000 --> 42:48.080
So, Isabel is the only one
with all the material,
we don't know where she is
and she isn't picking up.

42:48.080 --> 42:51.080
we don't know where she is
and she isn't picking up.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.640
Don't you have a copy?

42:55.200 --> 42:57.480
If she doesn't show,
I've got it all up here,

42:57.640 --> 42:59.680
-in my head.
-That's very comforting.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.600
We can project family photos.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.000
-Mr. Secretary.
-Commissioner.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.840
Enough with the formalities.
Thank you for coming.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.960
It didn't seem we had a choice.

43:31.160 --> 43:34.000
-We're all very busy.
-Weren't there three of you?

43:34.640 --> 43:35.960
Isabel Mora, yes.

43:36.840 --> 43:39.040
-Shall we wait?
-No, we can't wait.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.040
All of us here are fully aware

43:41.160 --> 43:44.600
of the controversy surrounding
the Strasbourg Court's decision

43:44.760 --> 43:46.560
to overturn the Parot doctrine.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.480
Right and left
are on the same page, for once.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.040
But having a killer
on the loose murdering ex-cons

43:53.880 --> 43:55.600
puts us in a difficult position.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.040
-I understand.
-I don't want you to understand.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.800
I want him caught.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.840
Then give us more resources.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.800
You respect something
you don't agree with.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.120
That's a fact.

44:10.320 --> 44:12.600
It's also a fact
that the National Police Force

44:12.760 --> 44:15.040
needs more time and resources.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.640
The resources are what they are.
And we have no time.

44:18.800 --> 44:20.280
Let's not waste more, then.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.280
Regarding the projector...

44:26.040 --> 44:27.040
Isabel Mora.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.400
Sorry I'm late.

44:31.520 --> 44:34.040
-We were just starting.
-Ready in a moment.

44:46.760 --> 44:47.760
Hello.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Hello?

44:51.160 --> 44:53.160
What, your friend isn't here?

44:54.080 --> 44:56.400
-Did you see him leave?
-I never saw him come back.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.120
He didn't spend the night here.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.080
Isn't he a bit young
for you, ma'am?

45:07.080 --> 45:07.120
Isn't he a bit young
for you, ma'am?
Do you take this much interest
in everyone in this dump?

45:07.120 --> 45:10.040
Do you take this much interest
in everyone in this dump?

45:10.040 --> 45:11.800
This is a respectable place.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.600
This is a complete shit hole.

45:14.080 --> 45:17.160
I hope you're paying him well,
it takes a strong stomach...

45:17.320 --> 45:18.520
Is there a problem?

45:19.480 --> 45:21.120
Here he is. Enjoy.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.240
-Where were you?
-Around.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Why did I give you a phone?

45:39.000 --> 45:40.560
You worry about me.

45:42.480 --> 45:43.520
I like it.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.800
You know
what it's like out there.

45:48.280 --> 45:50.760
-What if something happens?
-Relax.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.160
Don't do it again.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.480
You care about me.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.120
I care about you just enough.

46:19.760 --> 46:21.160
We're ready.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.640
We've split our assessment
into two parts:

46:27.800 --> 46:30.160
a timeline and progress
in the investigation.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.120
The data is thorough
and up-to-date.

46:32.240 --> 46:34.000
You'll see photos
of the victims,

46:34.000 --> 46:34.080
You'll see photos
of the victims,
the weapon used in each case

46:34.080 --> 46:35.840
the weapon used in each case

46:35.960 --> 46:38.160
and the repercussions
of each event.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.160
Shall we?

46:45.920 --> 46:46.960
Just a second.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.360
Just a moment.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.400
It's written up and saved,
it must be here.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.600
END OF PRESENTATION

47:05.880 --> 47:08.280
It has to be here.
There are 14 pages,

47:08.480 --> 47:11.920
including all the documentation,
photographs, other images...

47:13.360 --> 47:14.560
So...

47:18.200 --> 47:20.520
Come back when
you're properly prepared.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.160
Let's not waste more time.

47:58.760 --> 48:00.120
Damn!

48:03.400 --> 48:04.400
Damn!

48:16.400 --> 48:17.400
Isabel!

48:28.400 --> 48:29.720
Isabel!

49:36.040 --> 49:37.160
Where are you going?

49:47.320 --> 49:48.320
What are you doing?

50:16.960 --> 50:18.040
What are you doing?

51:29.680 --> 51:30.920
Isabel!
