10:49.398 --> 10:52.068
AFTERWARDS,
I REALIZED THAT

10:52.151 --> 10:54.987
I HADN'T THROWN ANYWHERE
NEAR MY BEST HUMP AT HER,

10:55.071 --> 10:58.741
SO, ON ONE HAND, I KNOW THAT
WE SHOULDN'T GO OUT ANYMORE,

10:58.824 --> 11:00.951
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

11:01.035 --> 11:02.495
IF I DON'T DATE
DORIS AGAIN,

11:02.578 --> 11:04.622
SHE'S GONNA THINK WHEN WE WERE
IN THAT LITTLE STUDEBAKER,

11:04.705 --> 11:05.623
I THREW HER MY BEST HUMP.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.375
NO, YOU CAN'T
HAVE THAT.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.376
MMM.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.669
THAT WAS MY DILEMMA.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.170
SO, UH...

11:11.253 --> 11:14.340
SO I WOUND UP BORROWING
ANOTHER BUDDY'S BUICK,

11:14.423 --> 11:16.342
AND I THREW HER
A FIRST-RATE HUMP.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.843
BUT OFF THAT,

11:17.927 --> 11:20.179
I BEGAN TO--TO REALIZE

11:20.262 --> 11:23.349
THAT SHE FELT THAT WE MIGHT
HAVE SOME POSSIBILITIES,

11:23.432 --> 11:26.310
WHICH I ALWAYS FELT
BAD ABOUT.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.691
SO, UH, HAVE YOU
SEEN HER SINCE?

11:31.774 --> 11:33.693
THAT'S THE FIRST
I HEARD OF HER.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.404
WALLY SENDING HER REGARDS,
YOU KNOW.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.617
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALL HER.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.539
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TIE MY FEET TOGETHER
TO A STREET CLEANER

11:46.622 --> 11:49.291
AND DRAG ME
AROUND THE BOROUGH
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.683
ARE YOU EXPECTING ME?
I'M ANDY SIPOWICZ.

12:05.766 --> 12:06.684
I'M MARGO.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.018
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.270
LAGRIMISSIMA.

12:11.647 --> 12:15.609
WE HAVE, UH,
CHEESE AND CRACKERS
AND NUTS.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.196
WANT SOMETHING
TO DRINK?

12:19.280 --> 12:22.491
UH, MAYBE ANY KIND
OF CARBONATED WATER
OR SOFT DRINK.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.702
ARE YOU REAL GLAD
YOU MADE ME WEAR
THIS SHIRT?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.537
THE STAIN WOULDN'T
COME OUT?
NO.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.580
Andy: CARLA?

12:27.663 --> 12:28.748
I'M ANDY SIPOWICZ.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.708
YEAH, I KNOW.
THE POLICE
DETECTIVE.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.377
YOU WANNA ARREST ME
FOR MY RELATIONSHIP?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.880
I THOUGHT
THE PERSECUTION LAWS
WERE REVOKED.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.632
HE WANTS SOME CLUB SODA.
I THINK WE HAVE SOME
CANADA DRY IN THERE.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.801
YEAH, SECOND SHELF
OF THE REFRIGERATOR.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.388
I'M NOT HERE TO ARREST
NOBODY, CARLA.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.766
YOUR FATHER WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.059
YEAH, HE FREAKS OUT
OVER TONY, HE FREAKS
OUT OVER MARGO.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.311
WHAT'S GONNA MAKE
HIM HAPPY, HUH?

12:50.394 --> 12:52.062
YOU CARE IF
HE'S HAPPY?

12:52.146 --> 12:54.815
I CARE ABOUT MAKING
A LIFE FOR MYSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.692
WHICH I HAVE A RIGHT
TO DO.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.944
AND SHE AND I
HAVE A RIGHT
TO OUR LIFESTYLE,

12:59.028 --> 13:01.989
AND IF I CHOOSE
TO SEE TONY, I HAVE
A RIGHT TO THAT, TOO.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.325
TONY IS A SCUMBAG WHO'S
GONNA RUIN YOUR LIFE.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.994
WHICH IS MY CHOICE
THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO MAKE.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.829
ARE YOU AWARE TONY'S
GOT A RECORD?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.706
I BROUGHT HIS SHEET
TO SHOW YOU.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.333
UNNECESSARY.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.002
I AM AWARE
OF TONY'S PAST.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.170
ARE YOU HIGH, CARLA?

13:16.253 --> 13:18.172
THIS HAPPENS TO BE
OUR APARTMENT

13:18.255 --> 13:19.715
IN WHICH
YOU ARE A GUEST.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.926
I DON'T APPROVE
OF DRUGS,

13:22.009 --> 13:24.428
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
BUT THAT IS
A PRIVACY ISSUE.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.387
WHO'S THIS GONNA BE?

13:25.471 --> 13:26.430
[BUZZ]

13:26.514 --> 13:27.890
[BUZZ]
I DON'T KNOW.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.683
IF THAT'S HIM,
I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ANY GARBAGE FROM YOU.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.893
[BUZZ]
IF THAT'S HIM,
HE'S NOT COMING
IN HERE.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.436
IF HE'S NOT COMING IN,
I'M GOING OUT.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.021
IS THIS YOUR PAL
TONY?

13:34.104 --> 13:35.648
[BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ]
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO MY FRIENDSHIPS.

13:35.731 --> 13:39.193
[BUZZ]
THAT'S WHY I WAKE UP GLAD
THAT I FOUGHT OVERSEAS, CARLA,

13:39.276 --> 13:40.319
[BUZZ]
SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU

13:40.402 --> 13:42.488
CAN MAKE SUCH GOOD USE
OF THEIR RIGHTS.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.573
OOH, LOOK
WHO'S HERE.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.492
NO, SOMEBODY ELSE IS
SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.202
Margo: DON'T MAKE ANY
TROUBLE HERE, TONY.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.037
I WAS REFERRING TO YOU,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.915
ASSUMING YOU'RE
THE NEW YORK CITY
LAW ENFORCEMENT COP.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.043
SO YOU TELL HIM TO COME HERE
WHEN I'M HERE?

13:56.126 --> 13:57.461
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE HERE
INTERFERING WITH MY LIFE,

13:57.545 --> 13:59.588
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D WANNA
MEET EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.340
NO, NO,
WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS

14:01.423 --> 14:03.717
TONIGHT THIS WAS
HOW YOU COULD MAKE
A MESS OF THINGS

14:03.801 --> 14:07.012
AND YOU COULD MAKE PEOPLE
THAT REALLY CARE FOR YOU
MISERABLE.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.765
OH, YOU MADE A GOOD
IMPRESSION ON HIM, MARGY.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.684
I ASKED YOU, PLEASE
DON'T CALL ME THAT.

14:11.767 --> 14:15.020
THIS GUY PROBABLY
LIKES WOMEN SAVING FOR
SEX-CHANGE OPERATIONS.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.397
OPEN YOUR MOUTH AGAIN,

14:16.480 --> 14:18.774
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GET BITCH-SLAPPED,
ALL RIGHT, TONY?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.985
I WAS INVITED HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

14:21.068 --> 14:22.570
Margo: THIS IS MY APARTMENT.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.697
YOU WANNA EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF STRANGERS?

14:24.780 --> 14:26.699
I'M NOT TRYING TO
EMBARRASS YOU, I'M--

14:26.782 --> 14:28.200
COME ON.
WE'RE GONNA GO.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.535
YOU TELL MY FATHER

14:29.618 --> 14:31.704
TO STAY OUT
OF MY BUSINESS.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.248
AND THEN TELL YOURSELF
THAT IN THE MIRROR.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.667
I'D TELL YOU THAT,
TOO, MARGO,

14:36.750 --> 14:39.461
BUT YOURS PROBABLY BREAKS
EVERY TIME YOU WALK BY IT.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.385
BEST THING YOU CAN DO...

14:46.468 --> 14:49.638
THROW HER STUFF
OUT IN THE STREET
AND CHANGE THE LOCKS.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.811
I'M SORRY
THINGS EXPLODED.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.333
GOOD MORNING,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.462
SHE'S GOING TO SCHOOL
TOMORROW.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.671
OH, WONDERFUL.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.298
EVER SINCE YOU TOLD ME

15:24.381 --> 15:26.300
SHE HAD
HER APPENDIX REMOVED
THROUGH HER BELLY BUTTON,

15:26.383 --> 15:29.470
I'VE HAD
SUCH A WEIRD IMAGE
IN MY HEAD.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.638
GOOD MORNING, ANDY.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.972
YEAH,
GOOD MORNING.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.724

I JUST WITNESSED
THE TERMINATION

15:38.020 --> 15:39.813

LAST NIGHT

15:39.897 --> 15:41.690
AND THE DIRECTION
IT'S ALL HEADED.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.317
SO WHERE'D YOU SEE
ALL THIS?

15:43.400 --> 15:45.527
IN THE APARTMENT OF
A SEX-CHANGE ASPIRANT,

15:45.611 --> 15:48.822
WHO, UH, WAS ACTUALLY
A NICE PERSON...

15:48.906 --> 15:51.659
AND THE TRASH-MOUTH DAUGHTER
OF A HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND
OF MINE

15:51.742 --> 15:53.577
ASKED ME TO GIVE HER
SOME LIFE ADVICE,

15:53.661 --> 15:55.245
WHICH WOULD BE TO
FIT HERSELF INTO A BAG

15:55.329 --> 15:57.247
AND THROW HERSELF
INTO THE EAST RIVER,

15:57.331 --> 16:00.250
PLUS HER GLUE-SNIFFING
HUMP OF A BOYFRIEND.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.251
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

16:01.335 --> 16:03.087
DO YOU WANT

16:19.353 --> 16:21.230
DETECTIVE,
ISN'T THIS THE ADDRESS

16:21.313 --> 16:24.274
YOU WERE SIGNED OUT TO
LAST EVENING?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.485
OH, MAN.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.287
NEVER MIND WHAT KIND
OF SICK SCUMBAG ASSHOLES.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.623
YOU TELL ME, HOW STUPID
DO THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE

17:21.707 --> 17:24.793
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THE SAME NIGHT THAT
I'M IN THAT APARTMENT?

17:24.877 --> 17:25.794
DETECTIVES,

17:25.878 --> 17:27.296
THIS NEIGHBOR SAYS

17:27.379 --> 17:28.756

THE APARTMENT BUILDING

A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.313
YOU THINK
HE WAS INVOLVED?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.148
I DON'T WHAT HE'D
BE INVOLVED FOR,

17:46.231 --> 17:50.069
BUT I'M GONNA BE
AWFUL SURPRISED IF HE
WASN'T IN THAT APARTMENT.

TO VISIT HER

18:08.837 --> 18:10.255

OF WEEKS AGO.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.882
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT WAS THIS STREET.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.759

IT WAS THIS STREET

18:13.842 --> 18:15.761

JUST 2 WEEKS AGO?

IT WAS THE SAME STREET.

A DELIVERY HERE.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.878
AND BEING ON THE STREET,

18:49.962 --> 18:51.547
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT
YOU MIGHT HAVE STOPPED BY

I'M NOT LOOKING TO PUT

18:59.304 --> 19:01.723

WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE DOING HERE.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.225

A DELIVERY.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.729

WE CAN REACH YOU LATER.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.045
SHE--SHE WAS
A HERMAPHRODITE?

19:32.129 --> 19:33.714
OR WHATEVER
HER PROBLEM WAS.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.048
THE POINT IS,

19:35.132 --> 19:37.759
I GOTTA GET THE DAUGHTER'S
USUAL PLACES FROM WALLY

19:37.843 --> 19:40.179
AND WHERE TO GRAB UP
THIS PSYCHO BOYFRIEND.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.597
WE KNOW THEY DID IT?

19:41.680 --> 19:44.349
A NEIGHBOR SAW ANOTHER GUY
LEAVING THE DOA's APARTMENT.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.434
THIS IS BRUCE HOAG.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.935
ANDY KNOWS THIS GUY,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.437

HE WASN'T INVOLVED.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.356
I'M SURE BRUCE HOAG,
THAT'S MAKING A DELIVERY
ON THE STREET,

19:51.440 --> 19:54.276
SUDDENLY REMEMBERS
THAT'S WHERE
THE SKELL DAUGHTER LIVES

19:54.359 --> 19:56.278
THAT WALLY ASKED HIM
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO

19:56.361 --> 19:58.280
TO TRY
TO STRAIGHTEN HER OUT.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.783
BRUCE FINDS THE DOOR OPEN
AND THE POOR HERMAPHRODITE
MURDERED,

20:01.867 --> 20:04.912
CALLS 911, AND HE WAITS.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.628
YOU WANT US
TO PICK HIM UP, RIGHT?

20:12.711 --> 20:15.505
I'LL GET
THE SKELL DAUGHTER'S
USUAL PLACES FROM WALLY,

20:15.589 --> 20:16.882
AND WE'LL GIVE THOSE
TO ANTICRIME,

20:16.965 --> 20:19.301
AND THEN WE'LL
GO GET BRUCE.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.428
YEAH,

HE'S IN A MOOD TODAY.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.226
YEAH, HUH?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.522
HOW DID YOU DO
WITH THE TEETH?

20:32.606 --> 20:35.317
OH, GUY WHO TRIED
TO SELL 'EM'S IN
THE POKY ROOM, BOSS.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.653
THIS GHOUL-LOOKING JUNKIE
DARREN.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.154
WE WERE IN
THE PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM

20:39.238 --> 20:40.989
WHEN HE COME IN
FOR HIS PRICE
FOR THE GOLD FILLINGS.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.366

20:42.449 --> 20:43.825
SO YOU'RE
GONNA FLIP HIM

20:43.909 --> 20:45.869
FOR WHO HIRED HIM
TO DISINTER THE BODIES?

20:45.953 --> 20:47.829
YEAH, WE FIGURE
IT'S PROBABLY, UH--UH,

20:47.913 --> 20:50.332
MORTUARY OPERATOR
OR SOMEONE OWNS
A GRAVEYARD.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.750
OK.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.794
GOT IT.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.338
HE DON'T SEEM
IN SUCH A BAD MOOD.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.301
I DON'T LIKE THE DEAD,

21:01.385 --> 21:02.803
AND THEY DON'T LIKE ME.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.805
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.098
ALL RIGHT,
SIT DOWN.

21:06.181 --> 21:08.141
YOU AND THE DEAD
NOT GETTING ALONG,

21:08.225 --> 21:09.810
PLUS LOCKING YOUR LIPS UP
LIKE THAT,

21:09.893 --> 21:13.313
THAT COMBINATION'S GONNA
EARN YOU 5 YEARS, DARREN.

21:13.397 --> 21:17.317
YOU'D RATHER
GET LOCKED UP FOR MURDER
THAN GRAVE-ROBBING, DARREN.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.820
SEE, INMATES
DON'T LIKE DOING TIME

21:19.903 --> 21:21.822
WITH PEOPLE
BEEN DIGGING UP
THEIR RELATIVES,

21:21.905 --> 21:24.324
MAYBE PLAYING WITH THEM
INAPPROPRIATELY--

21:24.408 --> 21:25.826
I DIDN'T PLAY
WITH ANY OF 'EM.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.411
BELIEVE ME, DARREN,

21:27.494 --> 21:29.496
ELSEWHERE'S WHERE YOU WANT
THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS LOCATED.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.165
NOW, DID SOMEONE HIRE YOU
TO DIG THOSE PEOPLE UP?

21:32.249 --> 21:33.417
OH...

21:35.294 --> 21:38.839
FIRST, I DIDN'T
DIG NOBODY UP
ON MY ACCOUNT.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.716
SECOND, THEY DON'T
GIVE ME SQUAT,

21:40.799 --> 21:42.217
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.219
10 CENTS ON A BUCK,
IF THAT.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.346
SO I SEE
SOME TEETH WITH GOLD.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.098
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR IT.
I FIGURED IT'S MINE.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.559
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE
GIVING YOU 10 CENTS
ON A DOLLAR?

21:50.642 --> 21:52.227
THEY GOT ME
BUSTING UP CASKETS

21:52.311 --> 21:54.229
AND PUTTING 'EM
IN DUMPSTERS

21:54.313 --> 21:56.231
AND ANY OTHER
DAMN PLACE.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.774
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

21:57.858 --> 21:59.776
ALL RIGHT,
PUT A NAME
TO WHO HIRED YOU.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.279
OUT WITH THE OLD,
IN WITH THE NEW.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.947
MOVING OLD BODIES

22:04.031 --> 22:05.282
AND OTHER OLD GRAVES.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.284
BURYING 'EM
UNDER PARKING LOTS.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.535
THROWING 'EM IN DUMPSTERS.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.787
WE UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY GOT YOU DOING.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.998

SIT DOWN.

22:22.841 --> 22:23.925
DARREN...

22:24.009 --> 22:25.302
SO MAYBE WE CAN WORK OUT
A DEAL WITH YOU

22:25.385 --> 22:27.387
IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO WEAR A WIRE ON THIS GUY.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.638
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WIRE?

22:28.722 --> 22:29.639
A WIRE.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.766
LIKE A SMALL MICROPHONE.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.309
NO. NO WAY.

22:32.392 --> 22:35.312
YOU'LL HEAR MY HEARTBEAT
AND PICK UP OTHER STUFF.
NO WAY.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.521
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR HEART?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.023
IRREGULAR BEAT
OR SOMETHING?

22:38.106 --> 22:40.817
YOU CALL THIS SHEEHY,
YOU TELL HIM
YOU WANT TO TALK.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.195
MAYBE YOU'D WANT
A HIGHER PERCENTAGE
FOR THE WORK.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.530
YEAH, THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.
I'M DUE THAT.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.784
YOU WEAR THE WIRE,
YOU CAN TALK TO HIM
ALL YOU WANT ABOUT THAT.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.328
THAT SOUND OK TO YOU,
DARREN?

22:51.411 --> 22:53.205
WILL IT PICK UP
MY HEARTBEAT?

22:53.288 --> 22:55.332
YES OR NO?

22:55.415 --> 22:58.168
NO. NO, THE MIKE'S
NOT THAT SENSITIVE.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.644
BRUCE.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.604
ANDY,
WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?

23:17.687 --> 23:20.399
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
SOME MORE QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.691
I DON'T HAVE MUCH
TO TELL.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.527
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
DOWN AT THE STATION HOUSE.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.821
YOU WANT TO LET SOMEBODY
KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE
TAKING OFF THIS AFTERNOON?

23:25.904 --> 23:27.697
I GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY OF WHAT'S
GOING ON, ANDY.

23:27.781 --> 23:28.949
Simone: TELL US
AT THE STATION HOUSE.

23:29.032 --> 23:29.950
HEY. BRUCE...

23:30.033 --> 23:31.368
TAKE YOUR HAND
OFF THE DOOR.

23:31.451 --> 23:35.330
TURN AROUND
AND LOOK AT ME.

23:35.414 --> 23:39.418
YOU WANT ME TO TALK ABOUT
MORE OF YOUR BUSINESS
OUT HERE ON THE DOCK?

23:39.501 --> 23:41.420
NO.

23:43.004 --> 23:44.381
NO.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.466
COME ON, LET'S GO.

24:08.488 --> 24:12.451
Sheehy: WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
YOU DRAG ME AWAY FROM
MY LIFE TO DEAL WITH?

24:12.534 --> 24:15.454
Darren: I DON'T LIKE
HOW YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
WHAT I'M OWED.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.538
OWED?

24:16.621 --> 24:18.874
I'M GIVING YOU
EASY MONEY.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.084
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR THAT, HUH?

24:21.168 --> 24:22.752
DO YOU THINK
IT'S FUN FOR ME,

24:22.836 --> 24:25.255
LOOKING AT
100-YEAR-OLD DEAD PEOPLE?

24:25.338 --> 24:27.799
YOU ARE LOOKING AT
SOME OLD BONES
AND ROTTED WOOD.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.468
IT'S EASIER
THAN HAULING TRASH.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.886
YOU DIG 'EM UP,
AND YOU THROW 'EM OUT.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.138
NOW, THAT IS IT.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.389
THEN YOU THINK OF
ALL THE NEW PEOPLE

BURIED HERE.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.559

WELL, THAT IS
PRETTY HIGHFALUTIN
FOR A JUNKIE.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.397

24:42.481 --> 24:43.857
YOU JUST TAKE
WHAT I GIVE YOU.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.234
IT'S ENOUGH TO SHOOT UP
THAT VEINY ARM OF YOURS.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.360
THAT'S ENOUGH.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.993

FOR WHAT?

25:02.834 --> 25:04.461
COMMINGLING
OF HUMAN REMAINS.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.338
THAT'S A FELONY
IN NEW YORK,

25:06.421 --> 25:08.131
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE
COMMINGLED IN A DUMPSTER,
YOU GHOULY SCUMBAG.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.258
NOW, LET'S GO.
COME ON.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.931
SO THE OTHER TWO

26:15.031 --> 26:16.616
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANY COFFEE?

26:16.700 --> 26:19.452
I'M NOT PERMITTED
TO DRINK THAT, ANDY.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.706
WALLY SAYERS
SAID THAT SAME THING
TO ME YESTERDAY.

26:22.789 --> 26:25.584
I'D ASSUME WALLY SAYERS
WOULD HAVE COME
STRAIGHT TO YOU, ANDY.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.793
NEVER GOT ME INVOLVED.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.587
BRUCE, UH, YOU GOT
TO GET STRAIGHT

26:28.670 --> 26:30.297
WHAT YOU WERE DOING
OUT ON THAT STREET.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.674
I TOLD YOU ON THE STREET
WHAT I WAS DOING OUT THERE.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.593
WHAT YOU TOLD US
ON THE STREET WASN'T
TRUTHFUL, MR. HOAG.

26:34.676 --> 26:35.802
NOBODY'S
LOOKING TO PUT YOU

26:35.885 --> 26:37.929
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS THING, BRUCE,

26:38.013 --> 26:40.724
BUT YOU'RE GOING
TO DO THAT TO YOURSELF
IF YOU DON'T COME CLEAN.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.684
THIS WAS AT WALLY'S REQUEST,
SPEAKING WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.395
THAT'S THE SUM
OF MY KNOWLEDGE
OF THAT HORNET'S NEST.

26:45.478 --> 26:48.106
A NEIGHBOR SAW YOU LEAVING
THAT APARTMENT, BRUCE,

26:48.189 --> 26:50.942
AND WE GOT YOUR VOICE
ON A 911 CALL.

26:51.026 --> 26:55.488

DRIVING FATALITY.

TO TELL HIS DAUGHTER

FOR HER. PERIOD.

27:00.535 --> 27:01.995

OF MY LIVER. NOW THIS
IS GONNA HAPPEN?

27:05.540 --> 27:08.960
JUST ACCOUNT FOR BEING
IN THAT APARTMENT, BRUCE.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.795

IN THE PAPER.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.758

OFF THE LIVER LIST,

INSIDE THE APARTMENT,

27:27.437 --> 27:29.356
YOU CALL IN TO 911,

27:29.439 --> 27:31.274
AND THEN YOU STICK AROUND
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.901
THEN WHEN ANDY RECOGNIZES YOU
ON THE STREET,

27:32.984 --> 27:34.110
YOU GET A LITTLE SCARED,

27:34.194 --> 27:36.863

ANDY. PLEASE DON'T
RAISE A HAND TO ME.

SOME QUESTIONS.

PUT WHOEVER DID THIS

ABOUT A YEAR OR SO.

ANYWAY.

WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE APARTMENT?

IT WAS AN INTRUDER.

OF MARAUDING AMAZON DYKES.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.995
I SAY
IT WAS AN INTRUDER.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.164
AND WE THINK IT WAS TONY
AND MAYBE YOU.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.665
NO. NO WAY.
ALL RIGHT?

29:52.749 --> 29:55.835
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED
TO MARGO WAS OUTSIDE
OF MY CONNECTION.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.254
IS YOUR MORON FRIEND TONY
GONNA TELL US THAT?

29:58.338 --> 29:59.798
HE DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU ANYTHING
EITHER.

29:59.881 --> 30:00.799
NO, BUT...

30:00.882 --> 30:03.301
FAMILIAR WITH HIM
HOW YOU ARE,

30:03.384 --> 30:05.762
THE BIGMOUTH JERK-OFF LOSER
THAT HE IS,

30:05.845 --> 30:08.139
YOU THINK HE'S GONNA
KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT?

30:08.223 --> 30:10.141
SEE, WHAT HAPPENS
IN THESE SITUATIONS,
CARLA,

30:10.225 --> 30:11.810
IS THAT SOONER OR LATER,
EVERYONE WINDS UP

30:11.893 --> 30:13.812
LOOKING OUT FOR
THEIR OWN INTERESTS.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.523
ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEBODY
STARTS JUMPING UP AND DOWN
ON THEIR NUTS

30:16.606 --> 30:17.982
LIKE I'M GONNA DO
WITH TONY.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.526
I THOUGHT
YOU AND MY DAD
WERE FRIENDS.

30:19.609 --> 30:22.362
WE ARE, CARLA,
AND IF YOU'D SHOW
SOME COOPERATION,

30:22.445 --> 30:24.030
MAYBE WE COULD THROW YOU
HALF A BREAK.

30:24.113 --> 30:26.866
YOU KNOW, CARLA,
YOU'RE NOT GIVING US
ANY KIND OF WIGGLE ROOM HERE.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.494
YOU'RE PEDDLING
THIS LAME INTRUDER THEORY,

30:29.577 --> 30:32.288
AND THEN YOU'RE
SHOVING YOUR RIGHTS
DOWN OUR THROATS.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.380
WHEN YOU TALK TO TONY,

30:40.463 --> 30:44.175
IF HE SAYS THAT I
PARTICIPATED ANY MORE THAN
LEAVING THE DOOR UNLOCKED

30:44.259 --> 30:47.554
AND BARRICADING MYSELF
IN MY BEDROOM,
HE'S LEADING YOU ASTRAY.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.265
SO YOU WERE IN THE APARTMENT
WHEN TONY MURDERED MARGO.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.724
I WAS NOT A WITNESS
IN THAT LIVING ROOM,

30:51.808 --> 30:53.101
SO I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT WENT ON.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.519
DID YOU HEAR HER SCREAMING,

30:54.602 --> 30:56.813
THE POOR GIRL
SICK IN LOVE WITH YOU?

30:56.896 --> 30:58.356
NO, I DID NOT.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.859
I HAD EARPHONES ON,
AND I HAD PILLOWS
OVER MY HEAD.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.945
AND YOU WANT TO BLAME HER
FOR WHAT HAPPENED?

31:04.028 --> 31:05.989
TONY HAS
A BAD, BAD TEMPER,

31:06.072 --> 31:07.991
ESPECIALLY WHEN
HE'S MIXING LIQUOR
WITH GLUE.

31:08.074 --> 31:09.450
AND YOU MADE SURE

31:09.534 --> 31:11.744
THAT HE WAS GOOD AND LOADED
ON BOTH OF THEM, RIGHT, CARLA?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.204
TONY WAS WHITE
AND OVER 21

31:13.288 --> 31:15.248
LAST TIME I LOOKED
AT HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.333
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
WAIT HERE, CARLA.

31:17.417 --> 31:21.254
HE'S GOT NO DRIVER'S
LICENSE, YOU SKANKY PIG.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.811
I'M GONNA BE
IN THE BACKSEAT HERE

31:36.895 --> 31:38.313
TO DETECTIVE SIMONE,
TONY.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.106
BASED ON MY APPROACH,

31:40.189 --> 31:42.317
WE'LL BE JUMPING
UP AND DOWN
ON YOUR TESTICLES

31:42.400 --> 31:43.818
BEFORE SAYING WORD ONE.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.486
I AM SO EAGER
TO DO THAT.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.947
WHICH DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ
KNOWS WOULD BE WRONG.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.949
WRONG IN THE SENSE,
TONY,

31:50.033 --> 31:53.828
OFF MY 10, 15 MINUTES
PLEASURE OF KICKING YOU
IN THE SCROTUM

31:53.912 --> 31:57.624
FOR BEING THE MURDERING
SKELL SCUMBAG
THAT YOU ARE,

31:57.707 --> 32:00.001
PROSECUTING THE CASE
AGAINST YOU
COULD BE JEOPARDIZED.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.086
IF IN FACT
THERE IS A PROSECUTION.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.463
Sipowicz:
NOW, DON'T LET HIM
GET OVER TO THAT EXTENT.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.381
Simone: IF YOU COP,
GET A PLEA BARGAIN,

32:05.465 --> 32:06.966
DON'T HAVE TO BE
NO TRIAL AT ALL.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.218
CAN I GET A WORD IN
EDGEWISE HERE?

32:09.302 --> 32:12.221
JUST BE AWARE
THAT YOUR LOYAL BANG CARLA

32:12.305 --> 32:14.807
ALREADY TOLD US
WHAT HAPPENED, TONY.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.852
YOU EXECUTING MARGO
IN THE LIVING ROOM

32:17.936 --> 32:20.480
WITH CARLA
TRAPPED IN THE BEDROOM,
TRYING TO COME TO HER AID.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.941
YOU KNOW WHAT CARLA
WAS DOING IN THE BEDROOM?

32:23.024 --> 32:25.902
SHE HAD EARPHONES ON
LISTENING TO LED ZEPPELIN.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.487
<i>STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN,</i>
YOU KNOW?

32:27.570 --> 32:30.281
'CAUSE SHE THOUGHT
THAT WOULD BE FUNNY,
HER LISTENING TO THAT

32:30.365 --> 32:32.700
WHILE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
IN THE LIVING ROOM
WAS HAPPENING.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.827
WITH YOU SENDING MARGO
TO HEAVEN, RIGHT?

32:34.911 --> 32:36.871
TAKING A SLEDGEHAMMER
TO MARGO.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.831
I WAS ACTING
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.249
HOW DID THAT
COME ABOUT, TONY?

32:40.333 --> 32:41.751
YOU BROUGHT
THE SLEDGEHAMMER OVER,

32:41.834 --> 32:43.461
JUST EXPECTING
YOU <i>MIGHT </i>BE ATTACKED?

32:43.544 --> 32:45.004
I BROUGHT
THE SLEDGEHAMMER

32:45.088 --> 32:47.757
BEING SICK OF THAT
SEX FREAK'S THREATS.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.676
OH, YOU WERE SICK OF
MARGO THREATENING YOU.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.887
BELIEVE ME,
CARLA NEVER LOVED
THAT SICK-LOOKING GEEK.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.472
SHE WAS GOOFIN' ON MARGO.

32:54.555 --> 32:57.392
SHE LIKED PISSIN' ME OFF
AND FREAKIN' OUT HER DAD.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.978
THE LITTLE SLUT DIDN'T
CARE WHO DID WHAT
TO HER, ANYWAY,

33:00.061 --> 33:02.271
AS LONG AS
IT GOT HER OFF.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.232
INTERRUPTING OUR INTERVIEW
APPROACH WITH YOU HERE

33:04.315 --> 33:06.442
JUST FOR A SECOND, TONY...

33:22.834 --> 33:24.377
GO AHEAD,
FINISH YOUR THOUGHT.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.087
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOIN' ON?

33:26.170 --> 33:29.090
HERE? WELL, WE'RE TALKING
TO SOMEONE THAT EVERYONE
IN THIS ROOM KNOWS

33:29.173 --> 33:32.385
PREMEDITATED
SLAUGHTERING A GIRL
WHOSE ONLY CRIME

33:32.468 --> 33:33.928
WAS LOVING
THE PIECE OF GARBAGE
THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.014
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE
THAT MUCH MORE TO DO WITH YOU,

33:36.097 --> 33:38.016
AND WITH THE D.A.s
AND THE JUDGES

33:38.099 --> 33:40.018
TENDING TO PAY ATTENTION
TO WHAT WE SAY,

33:40.101 --> 33:41.853
WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU
PUT A STATEMENT TOGETHER

33:41.936 --> 33:45.231
SAYING THAT THIS
WAS A CRIME OF PASSION.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.608
SO, LIKE IT WASN'T
PREMEDITATED.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.819
EXACTLY.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.739
WHICH MAYBE GETS YOU
A SHOT AT 15 YEARS
WITH PAROLE ELIGIBILITY

33:52.822 --> 33:55.742
INSTEAD OF FIRST-DEGREE
MURDER, WHICH, LIKE I SAID,

33:55.825 --> 33:58.828
JUST BETWEEN US BOYS HERE,
WE ALL KNOW YOU OUGHT TO GET.

33:58.911 --> 34:00.955
I THINK YOU BROKE MY JAW.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.248
Sipowicz: YOU'RE
ENUNCIATING CLEARLY.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.916
THAT HAPPENED RUNNING
FOR THE DOOR THERE, TONY.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.628
RUN FOR IT AGAIN.
I'LL SHOW YOU AGAIN
HOW YOU DID IT.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.714
YOU KNOW,
HOW YOU PEOPLE WORK
IS SICKENING.

34:09.797 --> 34:13.009
TONY, THINK BACK
TO THE LAST 5 MINUTES
OF THAT GIRL'S LIFE

34:13.092 --> 34:15.261
THAT DID NOTHING
TO DESERVE WHAT WAS
HAPPENING TO HER,

34:15.344 --> 34:17.972
WHAT SHE MUST
HAVE BEEN FEELING
TRYING TO SAVE HERSELF

34:18.056 --> 34:20.433
WHILE YOU BEAT HER TO DEATH
WITH THAT HAMMER.

34:24.937 --> 34:27.982
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT CHOICES HAVE I GOT?

34:32.070 --> 34:33.780
NONE.

34:33.863 --> 34:38.451
BELIEVE ME,
SHE EGGED ME ON
TO DO THIS.

34:38.534 --> 34:39.952
CARLA.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.375
AND I SHOULD NEVER
SNIFF GLUE.

34:57.011 --> 34:58.596
HEY.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.389
YOU ARE LUCKY
THAT MY PARTNER

35:00.473 --> 35:03.893
IS ATTENDING HIS WIFE'S
AMNIOCENTESIS,
MR. SHEEHY,

35:03.976 --> 35:07.230
BECAUSE HE WAS
ESPECIALLY DISGUSTED
WITH THIS SCAM OF YOURS.

35:07.313 --> 35:10.566
MY OWN POSITION IS,
I'M WILLING TO PAY
SOME NOMINAL FEES

35:10.650 --> 35:13.611
SO LONG AS THE MATTER
IS DISPENSED WITH
IMMEDIATELY.

35:13.694 --> 35:17.281
OTHERWISE, I DEMAND COUNSEL,
AND I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER
TO SAY.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.785
MR. SHEEHY,
IF THIS MATTER
IS PUBLICIZED,

35:20.868 --> 35:24.497
YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT
EXTREMELY HIGH
CIVIL LIABILITIES.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.999
COOPERATION
MIGHT AVOID THAT.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.919
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY, UH,
COOPERATION?

35:30.002 --> 35:33.756
I MEAN A FULL STATEMENT
OF HOW THIS
CAME TO PASS.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.217
YOU KNOW, WHAT
YOU'RE DISTRESSED ABOUT

35:36.300 --> 35:39.303
ISN'T ANY CRIME
THAT I MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED.

35:39.387 --> 35:42.431
IT HAS TO DO WITH
YOUR OWN TABOOS
ABOUT DEATH.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.433
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TABOOS?

35:44.517 --> 35:47.019
PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE SEEING
THEIR LOVED ONES

35:47.103 --> 35:48.646
REDUCED TO
EXTRACTED MOLARS.

35:48.729 --> 35:52.942
THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING WRONG
WITH COMMINGLING REMAINS.

35:53.025 --> 35:57.029
THERE'S ONLY
A FINITE AMOUNT OF SPACE
AVAILABLE ON THIS EARTH

35:57.113 --> 35:59.490
TO INDULGE PEOPLE'S ILLUSIONS

35:59.574 --> 36:02.201
ABOUT SANCTIFYING THE DEAD.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.663
OH, YEAH?

36:05.746 --> 36:08.624
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU ARE, MR. SHEEHY?

36:08.708 --> 36:10.126
A MERCENARY CREEP

36:10.209 --> 36:13.546
MASQUERADING
AS SOME KIND
OF PHILOSOPHER.

36:13.629 --> 36:16.757
CALCIUM, DENTIN, ENAMEL.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.177
THAT'S ALL THAT'S
IN THE JAR, DETECTIVE.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.637
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU PUT IT.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.390
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN YOUR LAWYER
GETS HERE, MR. SHEEHY.

36:24.473 --> 36:27.268
'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ATTITUDE.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.521
AND YOU CAN
COMMINGLE THAT.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.485
WHAT WAS MY DAUGHTER'S
PART IN IT, ANDY?

36:36.569 --> 36:38.529
WAS CARLA
CENTRALLY INVOLVED?

36:48.831 --> 36:50.333
SHE WAS, WALLY, YEAH.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.251
SHE WAS?

36:52.335 --> 36:53.961
SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY
USE THE HAMMER,

36:54.045 --> 36:56.672
BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
THAT SHE HAD KNOWLEDGE
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.508
SHE EGGED THIS TONY ON.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.801
I'M SORRY.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.096
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE,

37:04.180 --> 37:07.683
CONFLICT WITH HER ROOMMATE
WITH THE COMPLEX?

37:07.767 --> 37:10.269
I'D HAVE TO SAY
IT WAS LESS A CONFLICT

37:10.353 --> 37:12.104
THAN A THRILL-TYPE
MOTIVE, WALLY.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.023
A THRILL-TYPE MOTIVE?

37:14.106 --> 37:18.861
IF SHE'S INVOLVED
IN A MURDER
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES,

37:18.945 --> 37:21.864
SHE <i>SHOULD </i>BE TAKEN
FROM SOCIETY.

37:23.115 --> 37:25.201
YOU WANT TO SEE HER?

37:28.955 --> 37:31.916
IF SHE ASKS, TELL HER
I'LL PAY FOR A LAWYER.

37:31.999 --> 37:34.710
COULD YOU DO ME
A FAVOR, WALLY?

37:34.794 --> 37:39.006
OH, SURE. I APPRECIATE
YOUR EFFORT YOU MADE TO HELP.

37:39.090 --> 37:42.051
BRUCE HOAG THAT YOU ASKED
TO TALK TO CARLA...

37:42.134 --> 37:44.053
I'M SORRY
I GOT HIM INVOLVED, TOO.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.347
WELL, EVIDENTLY
HE STOPPED BY
THE APARTMENT

37:46.430 --> 37:48.391
THIS MORNING
TO CHECK ON CARLA.

37:48.474 --> 37:51.394
WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME
IF IT WAS HIM
CALLED 911.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.896
THEN HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND
THE GIRL MURDERED?

37:53.980 --> 37:56.023
HE'S NOT ADMITTING
TO IT, BUT, UH,

37:56.107 --> 37:58.401
I THINK
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

37:58.484 --> 38:01.404
ANDY, DON'T LET HIM
GET IN TROUBLE OVER THIS.

38:01.487 --> 38:03.656
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT THAT PART,

38:03.739 --> 38:05.157
BUT IF YOU COULD
REASSURE HIM

38:05.241 --> 38:08.536
THAT YOU DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE HE'D LET YOU
DOWN IN ANY WAY

38:08.619 --> 38:09.620
AND SO FORTH.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.539
OH, I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA CALL BRUCE,

38:11.622 --> 38:14.333
ASK IF HE'LL SEE ME
SO I CAN REASSURE HIM.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.128
Wally:
AND I HOPE HE GETS
HIS LIVER IN TIME.

38:18.671 --> 38:21.632
THIS IS WALLY SAYERS,
MY BUDDY FROM
HIGH SCHOOL.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.592
THIS IS MY PARTNER
BOBBY SIMONE.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.094
GOOD TO MEET YOU, SIR.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.471
I'M SORRY FOR
WHAT MY DAUGHTER DID.

38:28.723 --> 38:32.601
DORIS SPEAKS OF YOU
FONDLY, ANDY.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.020
MY SISTER.

38:35.521 --> 38:37.440
CAN I SEND YOUR REGARDS?

38:37.523 --> 38:39.442
TELL HER I SAID HI.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.860
ALL RIGHT.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.453
FOR A MORON,

38:50.536 --> 38:52.788
THIS, UH, TONY GIVES US
CHAPTER AND VERSE.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.459
DID HE PUT
IN THE STATEMENT

38:56.542 --> 38:57.626
HOW WE PROMISED
TO LOWER HIS CHARGE
IF HE CONFESSED?

38:57.710 --> 39:00.671
I TOLD HIM THIS WASN'T
THE RIGHT DOCUMENT FOR THAT.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.466
WELL, THAT'S WHERE
THE MORON PART
CAME TO YOUR AID.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.968
LET ME CALL
THIS BRUCE HOAG.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.637
THAT POOR GUY
WENT INTO A VAPOR LOCK,
HUH, HE WAS SO SCARED?

39:08.721 --> 39:11.474
I WANT TO LET HIM KNOW
WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS
WITH HIM.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.517

ON HIS RADAR SCREEN,

HE DON'T GET
HIS LIVER TRANSPLANT.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.524
NOW, LOOK AT ME,
I MEAN,

39:20.608 --> 39:22.026
I'M IN RELATIVELY
GOOD HEALTH.

39:22.109 --> 39:23.903
I CAN'T PISS,
I CAN'T SEE,

39:23.986 --> 39:25.905
BUT, UH,
I'LL TELL YOU,

39:25.988 --> 39:28.366
THIS GETTING OLD,

39:28.449 --> 39:30.409
IT AIN'T FOR SISSIES.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.832
YOU WANT THIS CLOSED?

39:36.916 --> 39:38.334
PLEASE, DETECTIVE.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.794
[DOOR CLOSES]

39:39.877 --> 39:43.714
WE HAVE TO CONFRONT
THE EVENTS
OF YESTERDAY MORNING.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.883
<i>I </i>HAVE TO CONFRONT THEM.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.093
ALL RIGHT.

39:47.176 --> 39:49.595
HOW I'M SPEAKING TO YOU
AT PRESENT

39:49.678 --> 39:51.597
IS NOT MY TRUE FORM
OF SPEECH.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.556
YOUR ACCENT.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.225
THAT'S CORRECT.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.769
I AM FROM AUSTRALIA.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.063
WHY ARE YOU SPEAKING
THE WAY YOU'RE SPEAKING?

39:59.146 --> 40:02.942
WELL, I'M NOW
GONNA START SPEAKING
WITH MY TRUE ACCENT.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.362
[AUSTRALIAN ACCENT]
I AM FROM AUSTRALIA.

40:06.445 --> 40:09.073
I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE
FOR 2 YEARS IN MANHATTAN,

40:09.156 --> 40:13.411
WHERE EVEN AS A PRETEEN,
I DREAMED OF LIVING
AND BECOMING A POLICEWOMAN.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.121
MAY I PLEASE SIT DOWN?

40:15.204 --> 40:16.122
SURE. HERE.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.540
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME WATER?

40:17.623 --> 40:19.208
NO. THANKS VERY MUCH.

40:21.460 --> 40:24.213
WITH TRAINING, I COULD BE
A GOOD POLICEWOMAN,

40:24.296 --> 40:25.714
DON'T YOU THINK?

40:25.798 --> 40:27.716
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.052
AND IT WOULD BE
THANKS TO MY AUNT,
WHO NEVER SAID

40:30.136 --> 40:31.554
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
REACH MY GOAL.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.139
ARE YOUR FOLKS--
THEY'RE NOT AROUND?

40:33.222 --> 40:35.141
I DON'T HAVE MUCH
TO DO WITH THEM.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.977
THEY MOVED TO PERTH,
WAY ACROSS COUNTRY.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.895
MAY I HAVE SOME WATER?

40:39.979 --> 40:41.147
YEAH.

40:49.655 --> 40:51.323
AS FOR MY ACCENT,

40:51.407 --> 40:54.577
I WATCHED
<i>THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES</i>
FAITHFULLY AS A CHILD,

40:54.660 --> 40:56.245
AND I ALWAYS LIKED ELLY MAE.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.830
I SEE.

40:57.913 --> 41:00.082
I DID WATCH <i>DRAGNET,</i>

41:00.166 --> 41:02.084
BUT AMONG POLICE SHOWS,
MY DEEP FAVORITE

41:02.168 --> 41:03.586
WAS <i>NAKED CITY,</i>

41:03.669 --> 41:05.963
AND I DREAMED OF BEING
A NEW YORK CITY POLICEWOMAN.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.466
IS YOUR NAME
NAOMI REYNOLDS?

41:08.549 --> 41:09.925
YES, IT IS.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.970
BUT I HAVE GENERATED
A UNITED STATES IDENTITY

41:13.053 --> 41:15.764
AS NAOMI REYNOLDS
OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA,

41:15.848 --> 41:19.059
DIFFERENT FROM MY IDENTITY
AS NAOMI REYNOLDS
OF CANBERRA,

41:19.143 --> 41:23.063
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
ON A TEMPORARY
VISITOR'S PERMIT.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.025
THIS HAS INVOLVED PURCHASE

41:26.108 --> 41:28.527
OF CERTAIN FALSE
DOCUMENTATIONS.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.780
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT ALL THAT?

41:31.864 --> 41:35.284
WELL, I THINK YOU GOT
SOME BIG PROBLEMS

41:35.367 --> 41:39.038
WITH YOUR RESIDENCY
AND YOUR CITIZENSHIP
SITUATIONS THERE, NAOMI.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.539
I KNOW.
I KNOW I DO,

41:40.623 --> 41:43.042
AND I HAVE BEEN AFRAID
TO PURSUE MY MAIN GOAL

41:43.125 --> 41:44.919
WITH ALL THAT HANGING FIRE.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.046
YOUR MAIN GOAL BEING
WANTED TO GET
ON THE JOB?

41:47.129 --> 41:48.547
ON THE JOB.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.050
IF YOU KNEW HOW I FEEL

41:51.133 --> 41:53.552
HEARING THOSE WORDS
APPLIED TO ME...

41:53.636 --> 41:54.970
EVEN IN A POSSIBLE
NEGATIVE CONTEXT.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.139
WELL, NAOMI,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

41:57.223 --> 42:00.643
I'M GONNA
PUT YOU IN ANY TROUBLE
OR ANYONE HERE ON THE SQUAD,

42:00.726 --> 42:02.645
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO REALIZE

42:02.728 --> 42:05.898
THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT,
SOMETHING IS GONNA GO WRONG.

42:05.981 --> 42:07.399
SUPPOSE
YOUR BUILDING MANAGER

42:07.483 --> 42:09.818
DON'T WANT TO
GIVE YOUR DEPOSIT BACK.

42:09.902 --> 42:12.321
HE'S LIABLE TO CALL
THE I.N.S.,

42:12.404 --> 42:13.739
DROP A DIME.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.491
THERE YOU GO.

42:15.574 --> 42:17.493
BUT AS FAR AS THE SQUAD,

42:17.576 --> 42:19.203
I'M SQUARE WITH YOU LOT?

42:19.286 --> 42:21.997
YEAH, YOU-YOU'RE
SQUARE WITH US.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.583
I AM SO GRATEFUL, DETECTIVE.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.585
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU

42:26.669 --> 42:29.088
THAT EVEN THOUGH
I HAVEN'T REALIZED
MY MAIN GOAL,

42:29.171 --> 42:31.590
BEING A P.A.A.
IN THE 15th DETECTIVE SQUAD

42:31.674 --> 42:34.677
HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HAPPIEST
EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE

42:34.760 --> 42:36.720
AND DEFINITELY
THE HAPPIEST WORK EXPERIENCE.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.138
I'M GLAD.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.765
THANK YOU.

42:39.848 --> 42:44.019
ANYWAYS, UH, I'M GONNA
GIVE ANDY THIS CONFESSION
THAT I SECURED

42:44.103 --> 42:45.521
AND THEN I'M GONNA BE
GOING HOME.

42:45.604 --> 42:47.856
ALL RIGHT.
AND BELIEVE ME,

42:47.940 --> 42:49.358
I'M GONNA THINK THROUGH

42:49.441 --> 42:51.527
HOW TO SORT OUT
MY RESIDENCY AND
CITIZENSHIP SITUATIONS.

42:51.610 --> 42:52.570
GOOD.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.363
DETECTIVE,
IN A GROUP SITUATION,

42:54.446 --> 42:57.575
OBVIOUSLY I'LL CONTINUE
SPEAKING AS NAOMI REYNOLDS
OF DURHAM.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.076
THAT MAKES SENSE.

42:59.159 --> 43:01.078
HOW DO YOU WANT ME
TO SPEAK TO YOU

43:01.161 --> 43:03.080
WHEN IT'S JUST
THE TWO OF US?

43:03.163 --> 43:04.415
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

43:04.498 --> 43:06.917
I COULD SPEAK TO YOU
IN MY NATIVE ACCENT

43:07.001 --> 43:08.961
AS A SORT OF GESTURE
OF APPRECIATION,

43:09.044 --> 43:11.880
BUT I'M AFRAID THINGS
WOULD GET TOO COMPLICATED.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.382
YEAH, YEAH.
WELL...

43:13.465 --> 43:15.551
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
STICK WITH THE, UH,

43:15.634 --> 43:17.720
ELLY MAE-TYPE ACCENT
ACROSS THE BOARD?

43:17.803 --> 43:19.722
THAT WAS MY THINKING, TOO.

43:19.805 --> 43:22.725
THE WAY YOU HAVE
TAKEN THIS, TO ME,

43:22.808 --> 43:25.227
IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE
OF EVERYTHING I ADMIRE

43:25.311 --> 43:27.104
ABOUT THE NEW YORK CITY
POLICE FORCE.

43:27.187 --> 43:29.523
WELL...THANKS.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.524
THANK <i>YOU.</i>

43:30.608 --> 43:31.817
THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.487
OPEN OR CLOSED?

43:35.571 --> 43:37.448
OPEN, PLEASE.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.374
TEETH.

43:51.545 --> 43:53.964
YOU, UH, GET THE 5s?

43:54.048 --> 43:56.050
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?
