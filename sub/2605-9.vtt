WEBVTT

01:46.482 --> 01:48.232
Backup generators
should have come on already.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.358
Maybe it just needs a minute.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.277
It doesn't just need a minute.
It's an emergency generator

01:51.361 --> 01:53.070
that's supposed to make a seamless handoff,

01:53.155 --> 01:55.156
so if this happens during a show... Herb?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.699
Power's out in the whole building.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.035
It's been explained to me 19 different ways

01:59.119 --> 02:01.162
how we can never lose power in the studio.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.622
What about all the redundancies?

02:02.706 --> 02:04.415
There was a round of budget cuts
before you got here,

02:04.500 --> 02:05.917
and they cut some of the redundancies...

02:06.001 --> 02:06.959
Don't say it.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.795
...because they thought they were redundant.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.713
Okay.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.965
- That's a good sign, right?
- Those are battery powered.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.593
- When should I start to worry?
- I'd have started already.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.553
Electricians are on their way.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.555
We lost power in the studio.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.474
What makes you say that?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.731
Everybody, listen up. It's the whole building.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.983
We've sent for maintenance
to check on our generator.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.109
They should be here in a minute.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.402
They've got to walk up 25 floors.

02:33.737 --> 02:37.365
Okay, they should be here
in a couple of hours.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.116
Neal, I want you to be in charge

02:39.201 --> 02:41.619
of rationing battery life
for laptops and cell phones.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.829
- I have a question.
- Yes?

02:42.913 --> 02:44.080
What if the power doesn't go back on?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.832
I don't think that's a realistic possibility.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.166
I don't mean ever.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.001
I mean what if the power
doesn't go on by show time?

02:49.086 --> 02:51.003
Do we have a contingency?

02:53.715 --> 02:55.258
No.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.134
Mac?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.846
A miracle.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.270
A miracle happens.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.732
We become a team again.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.569
We all hate this, right?

03:14.653 --> 03:17.113
We're gonna hate it more
after 10 minutes of no air conditioning.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.533
No, not the power outage.
We hate what we're doing.

03:20.617 --> 03:24.287
We hate that we're covering
Casey Anthony and Anthony Weiner.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.873
We hate that we have to
do it to save the ratings,

03:26.957 --> 03:29.083
we hate that we have
to bump important stories,

03:29.167 --> 03:32.128
and we're starting to be
not very pleasant people to be around.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.381
Guys, this is real.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.008
I'm not making this up.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.760
Just a minute ago,
when I was prepping for a pre-tape

03:39.845 --> 03:41.804
with that idiot
who's still sitting in the studio...

03:41.889 --> 03:43.598
- Are you talking about me?
- No!

03:43.682 --> 03:45.391
Yes. When I was prepping
for her pre-tape, I said,

03:45.475 --> 03:47.894
"God, please show me a sign

03:47.978 --> 03:50.062
"that I'm not doing a big thing badly."

03:50.522 --> 03:53.608
And right that second, all the power went out.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.320
And so obviously I thought,
"There's my answer."

03:57.404 --> 03:59.697
Raise your hand
if Mac's freaking you the hell out right now.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.073
No, listen to me!

04:01.158 --> 04:03.117
Just tell us how we do the show
if the power doesn't...

04:03.201 --> 04:06.787
By being a team again.
And that was God's plan.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.831
Keep God out of this
and talk more about electricity.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.500
We do the show outside, right in the plaza.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.711
- How?
- Yeah, we can do this.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.255
What do we need? A desk, a camera,

04:16.340 --> 04:18.674
some microphones,
and a way to beam a signal into space.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.176
The grips take apart the anchor desk.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.094
And carry it down 25 flights?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.512
You bet your ass they do.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.598
We can use
a single tripod-mounted handheld.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.849
We park a sat truck out there.

04:26.934 --> 04:27.934
That's right.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.101
Run the video and graphics
through Washington.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.269
Yes!

04:30.354 --> 04:32.146
I'm in your sight line the whole time,

04:32.230 --> 04:34.190
in your ear and standing next to camera.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.275
I'll have a laptop with
a constant iNEWS connection.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.902
How do we get power to
editors to run the Avids?

04:37.986 --> 04:39.278
What did they do in Apollo 13?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.322
They shut down all the power
in the command module

04:41.406 --> 04:43.866
and siphoned it into the LEM.
I don't think that's gonna work here.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.827
What would they have done
if there was a hardware store in space?

04:46.912 --> 04:48.871
- Buy a generator.
- We're gonna buy two.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.123
One goes in an Avid bay
and the other stays downstairs.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.167
- What time does the sun set tonight?
- 8:37.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.044
Why in the world would you know that?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.128
One of those things.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.589
We'll need HMls with gels for the top half hour

04:58.674 --> 04:59.882
and incandescents for the bottom half.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.759
We need the NYPD for security

05:01.843 --> 05:04.595
and we need to trust each other.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.890
Does anybody think we're not good enough

05:07.975 --> 05:09.558
- to pull this off?
- No!

05:09.643 --> 05:10.643
Should I still be sitting here?

05:10.727 --> 05:11.894
I'm so sorry, Sandy.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.021
I know you had your heart set
on entertaining us

05:14.106 --> 05:16.148
with private details of
a man you were sexting with

05:16.233 --> 05:17.733
and maybe a Playboy spread,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.318
but we're not able to do pre-tape.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.196
So if you want to do the show,
you're gonna have to do it live.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.739
I already committed to Fox,

05:23.824 --> 05:25.241
and no offense, but it's a bigger audience.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.119
Shoot! Does anybody think we can't do this?

05:28.245 --> 05:31.247
- No!
- This is a blessing in disguise.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.748
I say the power going out

05:32.833 --> 05:35.209
is the best thing that ever happened to us.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.211
I say the power going out

05:37.295 --> 05:39.880
is what is gonna save this...

05:39.965 --> 05:42.091
Son of a bitch!

05:46.930 --> 05:49.849
You're a freaking riot, you know that?

05:59.860 --> 06:02.028
I meant to tell you,

06:02.112 --> 06:04.030
you should use the word "bombshell" more

06:04.114 --> 06:06.407
in the Casey Anthony coverage tonight.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.668
Sandy, you're back in business.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.295
- Great.
- Let's go.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.799
Bombshell after bombshell today
in the trial of Casey Anthony

06:23.967 --> 06:26.343
for the murder of
her two-year-old daughter Caylee.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.554
Casey's brother, Lee Anthony, took the stand

06:28.638 --> 06:31.974
to testify about the events
of the night of July 15, 2008,

06:32.059 --> 06:33.601
when Caylee was reported missing.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.645
- Watch and listen. It's riveting stuff.
- Roll five.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.023
When you asked your sister,

06:39.107 --> 06:41.817
"Why won't you allow us to see Caylee?"

06:41.902 --> 06:44.195
What do you recall her saying?

06:44.446 --> 06:47.656
I told Detective Edwards that she said...

06:48.742 --> 06:49.742
I'm paraphrasing...

06:49.826 --> 06:51.702
"Because maybe I'm a spiteful bitch."

06:52.162 --> 06:54.455
Lee Anthony described
his odyssey that month

06:54.539 --> 06:56.165
trying to find his missing niece.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.416
Oddly, he was never questioned

06:57.501 --> 07:00.002
about the defense's claim he molested Casey.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.421
For the latest, we're joined live from Orlando

07:02.506 --> 07:04.090
by ACN's Selena Machado.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.674
Can you describe
how you're feeling right now?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.927
- No.
- Selena, how did Casey

07:08.011 --> 07:10.012
seem today during her brother's testimony?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.014
Well, her demeanor was different with Lee

07:12.099 --> 07:13.224
than it was with her mother.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.434
The normally outspoken
Democratic New York congressman

07:15.519 --> 07:17.478
is suddenly tongue-tied and evasive.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.439
Here he is again today
with The Today Show's Luke Russert.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.358
- Roll 16.
- That's not a picture of you?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.276
You know, I can't say with certitude.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.196
My system was hacked.
Pictures can be manipulated.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.490
Pictures can be dropped in and inserted.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.534
Someone committed a prank on me.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.452
Somehow got access to my Twitter account

07:33.537 --> 07:36.247
and right away put up a picture

07:36.331 --> 07:37.957
that made fun of the name Weiner.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.501
Hey, we can be doing
mock debate prep during this.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.673
Hey, debate prep.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.801
You don't have to watch this.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.970
We don't know for sure
what happened here.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.305
I spoke earlier today with Sandy Witless,

07:53.390 --> 07:55.683
- a bartender...
- Whiddles, like carving wood.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.602
Excuse me, Sandy Whiddles,
a bartender here in Manhattan

07:58.687 --> 08:00.271
who had been tweeting
with Congressman Weiner

08:00.355 --> 08:01.814
for the past several months.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.858
- Here's that interview.
- Roll 22.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.359
Thank you for speaking to us, Sandy.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.443
Thank you.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.445
When did you become
a Twitter follower of the congressman?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.531
Let me say first that
I was more than a follower.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.950
We had a relationship,
which is obvious when you read the texts.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.618
Okay, and how long
has this Twitter relationship...

08:14.703 --> 08:16.996
- Does he usually smoke at his desk?
- For about five months.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.622
I have copies of the texts right here.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.999
I know you're eager to read the tweets.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.125
We'll get to those in a moment.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.209
Okay, because I...

08:22.294 --> 08:23.836
Did the congressman ever
talk to you or tweet to you

08:23.920 --> 08:26.297
anything that he was working on
in one of his committees?

08:26.381 --> 08:29.049
No. I have copies of the tweets right here.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.511
Two minutes and 20 seconds in the C block
to educate the public on

08:32.596 --> 08:34.513
the most irresponsible economic inaction
in my lifetime.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.473
I know, it's all upside down
because of Casey Anthony.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.808
Once ratings are back up...

08:37.893 --> 08:39.518
We're committing journalistic malpractice.

08:39.603 --> 08:41.187
Fortunately, there's no such thing.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.938
How great would it be if there was?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.398
I can understand your frustration.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.692
- What's your thing again?
- It's a website for trolls.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.028
They get together and
talk about their conquests.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.363
And I want to produce a story,
and Mac's given me the go-ahead

08:51.448 --> 08:53.199
- to go to the next level.
- Go on the website.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.867
Yeah, but I can't get in the conversation

08:54.951 --> 08:56.535
till I can point to another website
and show how I've...

08:56.620 --> 08:58.621
- Been an asshole?
- Yes.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.290
I have to go onto a message board
and disrupt the conversation

09:01.374 --> 09:02.708
to the extent that havoc ensues.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.752
Then I can go on the troll website
and brag about it.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.128
But you don't want to do
something or say something

09:06.213 --> 09:07.588
- that would hurt someone you don't know.
- Right.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.131
You want to say things that would hurt me.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.342
Yes.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.761
What website?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.388
You've heard of EconomyBrain. Com?

09:16.473 --> 09:19.391
Yes, it's a financial news aggregate blog
and discussion forum

09:19.476 --> 09:21.060
that attracts an intelligent level of debate.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.938
And the commenters have
a very high opinion of your analyses.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.606
So you'd like my permission to...

09:25.690 --> 09:28.234
Jump in there and invent heinous
and incendiary lies about you,

09:28.318 --> 09:30.444
end the intelligent debate,
and start a whole new one

09:30.528 --> 09:32.488
about, say, whether or not you're a whore.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.574
My dad and his friends are economists, too.

09:35.659 --> 09:36.909
So with Father's Day just around the corner,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.160
this'll save me
the trouble of shopping for him.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.328
I know.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.081
Just print out the whole whore debate
and put it in a nice frame for him.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.083
It would be my first story,

09:44.167 --> 09:46.293
and I really think it's a good one.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.883
I think so, too.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.761
Just let me know when it's over.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.597
- You're the greatest.
- I really am.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.483
This is Hang Chew's.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.527
The staff adopted it as their hangout

10:11.611 --> 10:14.321
'cause they get cheap food
and drinks until 9:00.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.950
- Can you spell that?
- N-l-N-E O-C...

10:18.034 --> 10:20.035
Okay.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.081
Is it important that
you treat me like I'm an asshole?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.501
I wouldn't say important so much as

10:27.585 --> 10:29.795
- it just sort of feels right.
- I know you'd agree it would be better

10:29.879 --> 10:31.380
- to keep our personal past out of this.
- Yeah.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.924
That said, I'd like to point out
that you broke up with me, too.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.719
- Listen, Brian...
- I broke up with you, we got back together,

10:36.803 --> 10:38.304
and then you broke up with me.
Those are the facts.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.139
I sure hope we're on the record for this.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.266
And during the second act,
you were with Will behind my back.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.644
Once again,
I was with you behind Will's back.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.938
Yeah, and it makes me feel great
when you say that,

10:48.023 --> 10:50.024
but I do think we should stick to the story.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.985
The story is this. Will is a heavyweight,

10:53.069 --> 10:55.070
and for a long time
he was pretending to be a lightweight.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.655
Because lightweights get higher ratings.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.906
Yes.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.284
Will's a lonely guy, isn't he?

11:04.748 --> 11:06.457
- Is he...
- He's lonely.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.667
He doesn't care about ratings
because of the money.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.336
He cares about ratings because the audience

11:10.420 --> 11:12.421
makes him feel less lonely.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.009
What are you planning
on writing about, Brian?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.761
I don't know yet.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.474
I have to talk to Sloan.
Excuse me one second.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.103
He is a lonely guy.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.232
I don't know if that started around the time

11:32.317 --> 11:34.276
I told him I'd been sleeping with you,

11:35.070 --> 11:36.403
but I'll bet it didn't help.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.369
Governor Pawlenty, the possibility exists

11:43.453 --> 11:45.621
that New Hampshire
will become the 23rd state

11:45.705 --> 11:47.623
to pass right-to-work legislation.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.293
As president, would you support
a federal right-to-work law?

11:52.087 --> 11:54.463
- You should have this.
- Give me a second.

11:54.547 --> 11:58.425
Try, "For much of my life,
my father was a Teamster truck driver."

11:58.510 --> 12:00.427
"My brothers and sisters were in unions.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.930
- "I was in a union."
- "We grew up in a blue-collar town.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.765
"We live in the United States of America."

12:04.849 --> 12:07.101
Governor, we know where we live.
Would you support...

12:07.185 --> 12:09.228
People shouldn't be forced to belong to

12:09.312 --> 12:10.938
or be a member of any organization.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.649
Yes, I strongly support
right-to-work legislation.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.151
That's what an answer sounds like.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.695
- Can I talk to you a sec?
- Yeah.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.491
Just the fact that they're debating

12:22.575 --> 12:24.451
- whether or not to raise the debt ceiling...
- I'm trying.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.329
I need to find a Casey Anthony guest
no one else has,

12:27.414 --> 12:30.290
and hopefully I won't be able to do it.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.668
I'll be rooting against you.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.877
Good.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.672
- You doing all right over there?
- With him?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.090
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.635
'Cause you give me the signal
and I can just get in there and...

12:42.345 --> 12:44.012
- You know.
- What?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.181
- I don't know.
- Okay.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.559
- Debt ceiling.
- Yeah.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.271
Just hang in there one more day.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.231
It's not one more day. It's another month.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.399
The mock debate's tomorrow.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.193
And once that's over, we need
the numbers to protect you from Leona.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.903
Not if Charlie's guy can do it for us.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.530
And if he doesn't turn out to be credible?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.116
Then... I don't know.
Let's take it one day at a time.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.368
And get a guest that's promotable.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.375
What are the flowers?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.252
Nothing.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.837
- Who are they from?
- I don't know.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.422
They didn't come with a card?

13:18.506 --> 13:19.882
- They did.
- The card wasn't signed?

13:19.966 --> 13:22.092
- It was.
- Was it another threat?

13:22.385 --> 13:23.844
- No.
- What am I missing?

13:23.928 --> 13:25.554
Do you really want this
on your plate right now?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.598
The flowers aren't for me, they aren't from me,

13:27.682 --> 13:29.641
they're just living in my office
for a little while.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.768
Can you be satisfied with that?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.483
- Are they for me?
- Let's go.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.152
- Speaker Gingrich.
- Yes?

13:40.236 --> 13:42.779
As a candidate for the Republican nomination
for president,

13:42.864 --> 13:45.532
you signed a fidelity pledge
promising to be faithful to your wife.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.160
- Now hold it right there.
- Didn't you also make that same pledge

13:48.244 --> 13:50.078
at your three marriage ceremonies?

13:50.163 --> 13:52.831
I find it absolutely disgusting
that the liberal media...

13:52.916 --> 13:54.917
- Fine.
- No, that would be his answer.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.960
I know. Are these guys
gonna be ready for tomorrow?

13:57.045 --> 13:59.046
- Absolutely.
- We blow the mock debate,

13:59.130 --> 14:01.673
we've been doing Casey Anthony
and Anthony Weiner for nothing.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.799
They understand.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.135
The debate is the only reason
we're scared of the numbers.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.428
- Right.
- The only reason.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.055
Right.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.517
We need a Casey Anthony guest
no one else has.

14:12.435 --> 14:13.477
Let me start here.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.980
By any chance does anyone
know anyone who knows anyone

14:17.106 --> 14:18.857
who knows Casey Anthony?

14:22.779 --> 14:23.737
Who?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.781
My roommate Lisa
went to high school with her.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.491
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.535
Why didn't you... Get her on the show.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.371
She's already been approached by everyone,
including the agent.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.665
- Dylan Kagin.
- She doesn't want to talk.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.708
- Convince her.
- She really doesn't want to talk.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.794
Be a producer. Do you want me to talk to her?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.421
No, I can do it.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.175
When you've got her booked,
let me know so they can start the promos.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.010
Do whatever you have to do.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.642
Okay.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.898
I like it. I do. But does it say Tonys?

15:00.149 --> 15:01.149
Well, it's the Tonys.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.569
You're gonna be the youngest person there
by about 50 years.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.861
You know what I mean, right?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.321
I think it looks spectacular on you.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.157
It's so hard.
I'm just not sure it's for the Tonys.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.909
What about Galliano?

15:10.994 --> 15:14.079
We stopped carrying Galliano

15:14.163 --> 15:17.124
after he, you know,
came out in support of the Holocaust.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.918
I mean, I don't agree with him,
but that's no reason to condemn him for life.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.503
If only the Germans had
had the same attitude.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.005
I told you on the phone...

15:23.089 --> 15:25.173
- I know, that's why we came in person.
- We?

15:25.258 --> 15:27.467
- I'm just here in charge of morale.
- I'm with a customer.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.552
Go ahead. We're not in a hurry.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.845
We're actually in a huge hurry.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.055
And I'm actually at my job,
where I work on commission.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.224
And I'm with a customer,
so I'll be done when she's done.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.101
- Is that her?
- You mean the only person in the store?

15:36.185 --> 15:37.144
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.896
Miss, I'm just a random heterosexual guy

15:39.981 --> 15:43.609
from off the street,
and I think that dress looks great on you.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.943
Don't even look at anything else.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.653
Buy that dress and wear it out of the store.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.488
He's just a... Don't worry.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.990
It would have meant more
if you'd said you were gay.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.284
- Why is that?
- Lisa, I think I'm gonna try on the Di Santo.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.952
Sure. Can I get you another glass of wine?

15:54.037 --> 15:55.537
I'd love that. Thank you.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.751
They're counting on me.
You'd be a big exclusive.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.628
It's what's called a "get." It's promotable.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.004
And we need things that are promotable

16:04.088 --> 16:06.006
so we can get daytime viewers
to stay with us for the story.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.925
Not for nothing, but you've never used
any of those words before.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.970
Well, sure, I have. But not in that order.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.973
Guys, it makes me sick.
It's an unspeakable horror that's happened.

16:15.058 --> 16:17.392
It's not a television show,
and I'm not joining the cast.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.936
And by the way, a week ago you guys
would have said the same exact thing.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.939
- A week ago we weren't...
- This is bananas!

16:23.024 --> 16:25.692
Well, the bodice hugs your body perfectly.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.110
Look how it shows off your legs. See that?

16:27.195 --> 16:28.820
- I do.
- You just got two inches taller.

16:28.905 --> 16:29.905
Okay, but the big question...

16:29.989 --> 16:31.156
Does it say Tonys?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.324
- Miss.
- Oh, God.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.785
That dress screams Tonys.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.244
You're gonna win in that dress.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.871
Oh, God, no. I'm not a nominee.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.831
That's how good the dress is.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.126
You wear that dress, and they'll just start
throwing Tony Awards at your head.

16:43.378 --> 16:47.172
You, I promise, will have skull contusions
if you wear that dress to the Tonys.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.507
I'd be terrible at this job.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.759
Yeah, I have a McQueen that you may love.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.844
And you know what?
If you take it right now, it's on the house.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.388
- I'm afraid it's not.
- Well, then it's on me.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.515
- It's $11,000.
- For a dress?

16:56.599 --> 16:58.016
Once again, I work on commission.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.144
That's three times what I paid for my car.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.939
- Let me know if you need any help in there.
- Thank you.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.108
A week ago, we weren't screwed.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.568
I knew her, that's it.
We cut third period together.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.153
Will's gonna treat you very gently.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.698
While he asks what?
Did she kill children during Spanish?

17:12.782 --> 17:15.117
- You can provide insight...
- No, I can't.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.203
No, I can't. I can't provide insight.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.039
I have no earthly idea how she...

17:21.124 --> 17:22.541
How this could have happened.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.544
I can't provide insight and
I can't stand the people who think they can.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.713
Lisa, I need a little help with these buttons.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.131
Sure.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.593
You know what these pants cost me?

17:33.678 --> 17:36.054
- $30.
- That's right.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.849
And they look just as good
as the ones that cost $40.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.478
You think they're kissing in there?

17:44.480 --> 17:47.023
Do you think they're kissing in there?

17:47.316 --> 17:51.069
If I was a woman,
I'd spend the whole day kissing other women.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.780
I don't understand gay men
or straight women.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.449
You know you're talking out loud, right?

17:55.533 --> 17:57.743
Take a look.
I think it's whimsical and romantic,

17:57.827 --> 17:59.745
but it's still chic.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.705
- I love it.
- Look how it defines your waist.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.582
- I love it!
- We have a winner.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.751
- Can we accessorize?
- No, I'm sorry, miss.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.753
We need to speak to Lisa for just one minute.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.756
You can browse in the accessories section,
and we'll give her right back to you.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.215
This isn't her fault, it's ours.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.093
- Please patronize this store.
- What?

18:15.178 --> 18:16.970
Take a look at the jade earrings,
and I'll be right with you.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.889
- Okay.
- Am I not making myself clear?

18:18.973 --> 18:21.057
Lisa, look at me.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.018
You know that there is
no way we'd be asking you

18:23.102 --> 18:25.687
to do something like this
if it wasn't important.

18:26.063 --> 18:29.065
We got ambushed by the trial
at the worst possible time.

18:29.150 --> 18:32.319
There's a new debate format we want to
show to reps from the RNC tomorrow.

18:32.403 --> 18:36.114
And if we can't keep the ratings going up,
it's not gonna matter.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.284
We've been working on this for months,
and it's important.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.578
And it's a good thing for everybody.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.663
We can debate
whether the ends justify the means...

18:43.748 --> 18:45.749
Will and MacKenzie are counting on you?

18:52.381 --> 18:53.882
I don't have anything to say.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.259
You won't be asked anything
you don't know the answer to.

18:58.763 --> 18:59.763
Okay, what do I do?

19:00.890 --> 19:03.391
Come to the newsroom at 7:00 tonight.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.478
Oh, thanks. I owe you one.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.938
I owe you more than one.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.733
Let's go.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.989
I don't know if it was clear

19:18.074 --> 19:22.118
from my e-mails and phone calls,

19:22.203 --> 19:23.703
but I've been wooing you.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.957
Still trying to get that second first date.

19:27.917 --> 19:31.670
And yet, I can tell from
the way you're staring at me

19:31.754 --> 19:33.922
right now that this isn't the best moment.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.926
You see that? I was able to tell
without your saying anything.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.262
Our minds are in sync.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.682
But there's not an ounce of quit in me,

19:43.766 --> 19:46.768
- so I'll woo you when...
- What the hell are you doing?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.979
All right, then. 7:00, it's a date.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.273
Not really. I'm not crazy.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.816
Thank you.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.697
Yeah?

19:58.781 --> 20:00.532
You wanted to see me?

20:00.616 --> 20:02.868
It's 100 degrees outside.
You're wearing a jacket?

20:02.952 --> 20:05.078
Because it's Ice Station Zebra in my office.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.706
- If you have any fresh fish you need to store...
- Those are yours.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.457
They were delivered for you this morning.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.878
Jim signed for them and looked at the card,

20:12.962 --> 20:14.713
which you can see isn't in an envelope.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.464
Jim signed for them?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.800
He said Maggie didn't see. She wasn't around.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.064
Maggie and I have broken up a lot
in the last year and a half.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.987
I've...

20:40.448 --> 20:41.781
I've gotten that sense.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.534
- When we break up...
- You go out with other women.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.369
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

20:46.454 --> 20:48.622
- I'm not judging you.
- Then we get back together.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.415
Do you tell the other women

20:50.499 --> 20:52.083
that you've gotten back together
with your girlfriend?

20:52.168 --> 20:54.336
We're talking about people that
I've been on one or two dates with.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.922
Does Maggie know that
you've been out with other women?

20:57.006 --> 20:58.006
No.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.091
Does Gina know that you're with Maggie?

21:00.176 --> 21:01.176
Jenna.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.137
Jenna. These are from... Her name is Jenna.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.764
You remember when I didn't care at all

21:05.848 --> 21:07.849
about the lives of the people
who worked here?

21:08.476 --> 21:11.019
- Yeah.
- Those were the days.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.605
- Time to go.
- Yeah.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.525
I can't walk through the newsroom with these.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.444
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.696
- Hey, Don.
- Yeah?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.075
I'm doing the right thing, right?

21:26.035 --> 21:28.620
To do a little wrong to do a big right.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.038
Get the debate.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.540
- Was that Shakespeare?
- Almost.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.376
- Okay.
- And I'm doing the right thing?

21:34.460 --> 21:37.587
No. You're either lying to Maggie
or you're lying to Gina.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.631
Jenna. And I just backed you up
with almost Shakespeare.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.757
You couldn't throw me a bone?

21:42.510 --> 21:44.344
I've got to go.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.354
- That was a cliché.
- I know.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.940
But if you stand in the rain without a jacket,

21:57.024 --> 21:58.566
you're gonna get a cold.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.360
And if you have a physically abusive father

22:00.444 --> 22:02.153
who abandons you and your family,

22:02.238 --> 22:04.823
you're gonna be 1,000 times
more sensitive to betrayal

22:04.907 --> 22:08.076
than the average person
who's already extremely sensitive to betrayal.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.577
I miss encyclopedias.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.913
I always wanted to have
a full set of encyclopedias.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.332
You know, you pull down "S" off the shelf,

22:14.417 --> 22:16.543
flip to a page, you read about, I don't know,

22:16.627 --> 22:19.421
Salic law and
why a woman can't inherit the French throne.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.715
- You can google it.
- That's my point.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.008
You have to know what you're looking for.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.301
You can't browse for anything anymore.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.555
Anyway, last night I was looking up
signal intelligence intercepts

22:28.639 --> 22:30.223
and whether they leave a fiber-optic footprint.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.350
Is it important that I know what that meant?

22:32.435 --> 22:35.770
No. We've got a whistleblower who's
giving us a big story and we have to vet him.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.732
But what happened was,
I was reading about fiber-optic footprints

22:38.816 --> 22:40.608
and a couple of clicks later, I was on

22:40.693 --> 22:43.111
a relationship advice website
called Help Me Rhonda.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.531
A woman wrote to Rhonda
saying that her husband was cheating on her

22:46.615 --> 22:49.534
and Rhonda suggested that
the woman had to examine

22:49.618 --> 22:52.829
what her role was in the cheating.
It made me crazy.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.331
Do you think it could possibly
have been the woman's fault?

22:55.416 --> 22:56.624
Are we saying that now?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.460
What I don't believe is that a couple clicks

22:58.544 --> 23:01.296
took you from fiber-optic footprints
to Help Me Rhonda.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.132
If you went to a relationship
advice website, just say so.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.300
It was the middle of the night.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.384
There was nothing else to read.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.261
Except the entire rest of the Internet.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.931
Do you and Rhonda honestly believe
that I share some of the blame

23:12.016 --> 23:15.018
or even a small part of the blame
for MacKenzie cheating with Brian?

23:15.311 --> 23:17.187
- Do you?
- No.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.147
Fine.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.982
'Cause that's about
the dumbest thing I've ever read.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.902
And I'll tell you what else,
I don't even think Rhonda's her real name.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.528
- Yeah, look...
- Maybe it is.

23:25.613 --> 23:26.613
I don't know. But she's a moron.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.364
You weren't part of the equation.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.492
Ruined a perfectly good Beach Boys song.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.036
Wait, what do you mean?

23:33.329 --> 23:35.080
I can't really assess someone I haven't met.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.289
Then why did you say it?

23:36.373 --> 23:37.999
Because I can assess someone I haven't met.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.918
My father left me volumes on the two of you.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.461
I had to get an extra filing cabinet.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.339
How was I not part of the equation?

23:44.965 --> 23:47.801
MacKenzie got dumped by Brian.
She got rejected.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.303
People react to that in different ways.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.263
When Brian started calling her again,

23:52.348 --> 23:54.599
she saw the chance to get un-rejected
and she took it.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.683
You weren't even part of the equation.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.520
But once she got un-rejected, she realized

23:58.604 --> 24:00.647
that she wasn't in love with Brian
in the first place,

24:00.731 --> 24:03.650
that she was in love with you,
and she confessed the whole thing.

24:03.734 --> 24:06.653
- Not right away.
- Who cares about not right away?

24:07.113 --> 24:09.114
When she thought
you were going to propose to her...

24:09.198 --> 24:11.783
Do you remember when I came in here
yesterday without an appointment

24:11.867 --> 24:13.785
and interrupted your session
with another patient?

24:13.869 --> 24:15.411
I do remember that. It was yesterday.

24:15.496 --> 24:18.039
And you said that
the trick was to forgive MacKenzie.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.917
- Yeah.
- I actually know that.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.796
Intellectually, in my brain,
I know MacKenzie deserves to be forgiven.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.464
I understood everything you said.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.925
I understand she's taken every punishment
I've given her,

24:29.009 --> 24:31.511
including having Brian hang around the office
and write his story.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.013
I understand
she's completely devoted to the show.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.432
I understand mistakes.
I understand time has passed.

24:36.517 --> 24:39.227
I understand all of that.
So why can't I forgive her?

24:40.271 --> 24:41.938
Because you weren't rejected.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.233
You were betrayed.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.075
How's it going, Sampat?

24:54.493 --> 24:57.328
Well, the problem with people
who post on EconomyBrain

24:57.413 --> 24:58.705
is they're not easily distracted.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.915
Damn those economists
and their adult attention spans.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.083
They're not making it easy for me.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.502
But a popular discussion at the moment

25:04.587 --> 25:07.046
is a recent article
projecting US credit rating fallout

25:07.131 --> 25:08.673
as a result of the debt ceiling standoff.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.842
Yes, I heard that on the news.
No, wait, I didn't.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.385
I heard about Casey Anthony instead.

25:12.469 --> 25:13.553
Well, that's where I jumped in.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.680
I said if I can balance my checkbook,

25:15.764 --> 25:17.807
why can't the government balance its budget?

25:18.267 --> 25:21.019
Mary, Mother of God,
am I sick of that insane analogy.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.188
Balancing your checkbook
is to balancing the budget

25:23.272 --> 25:25.940
as driving to the supermarket
is to landing on the moon!

25:26.525 --> 25:27.609
See?

25:29.111 --> 25:30.737
- I got you a little upset.
- Yes.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.364
So once they were hooked on
telling me how stupid I am,

25:33.449 --> 25:36.034
- I steered things in your direction.
- How?

25:36.118 --> 25:37.827
- You really want to know?
- No.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.204
- Good.
- Tell me anyway.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.539
I said the media and government
are in a conspiracy cahoots...

25:41.624 --> 25:44.751
- "Conspiracy cahoots"?
- I have to sound authentically moronic.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.463
How are the media
and the government in a conspiracy cahoots?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.089
By shoving your breasts in our face.

25:52.009 --> 25:54.093
- Many angry posters came to your defense.
- Good.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.346
- So I created a second user account.
- Of course.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.223
And asserted it wasn't your breasts
that were so compelling,

25:58.307 --> 26:01.476
- it was your blatantly slutty body movements.
- What evidence do you use...

26:01.560 --> 26:03.978
I posted a link on your Wikipedia page
detailing your rise

26:04.063 --> 26:06.439
from small-town stripper to
big-time financial news reporter.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.982
My Wikipedia page doesn't say that.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.400
Check again.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.194
You're going to see an emotional response

26:11.278 --> 26:14.656
on my face and
a physical response directed at yours.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.282
It worked.

26:16.367 --> 26:19.869
After two hours, I had economic PhDs
posting in all caps.

26:19.954 --> 26:23.039
And then the site administrator
froze the thread.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.583
All right.
And this is enough to get you accepted

26:25.668 --> 26:27.835
- into the fraternity of the pitiful?
- Almost.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.588
There's a sort of pledge process
for the fraternity of the pitiful,

26:30.673 --> 26:32.006
and this will get me to level one.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.300
Once I do that, I can get to level two

26:34.385 --> 26:35.385
and swim with the professional trolls.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.554
You're gonna be a good reporter.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.099
And I like that someone
is working on news stories.

26:41.183 --> 26:44.310
Well, for what it's worth,
I could really get behind a government

26:44.395 --> 26:46.938
that was in a cahoots conspiracy to
shove your breasts in our face.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.234
Re-edit my Wikipedia page!

26:51.777 --> 26:52.819
Soon.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.996
He's on his way.

27:04.498 --> 27:06.291
All right, what do you know so far?

27:06.375 --> 27:07.792
You got Lisa for tonight.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.294
They've already started promo-ing it.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.254
What do you have on the NSA source?

27:12.172 --> 27:13.423
He's not rock solid.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.091
Shit.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.884
He didn't do well on
his latest psych assessment.

27:16.969 --> 27:17.969
Oh, Christ.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.846
They lowered his security clearance.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.514
He also violated a restraining order.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.683
- An ex-wife?
- Yeah.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.061
And he was arrested for solicitation in 1979.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.731
If you had this guy on a witness stand...

27:29.815 --> 27:30.940
I wouldn't put him on a witness stand.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.817
Wait a minute.
He didn't score well on his psych exam,

27:32.901 --> 27:35.236
but they didn't fire him.
They just lowered his security clearance.

27:35.612 --> 27:38.197
Yes, he's stalking his ex-wife and,
yes, he tried to pick up a hooker,

27:38.282 --> 27:40.158
but that doesn't mean
he's lying about the NSA.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.160
All we have are the transcripts
of his testimony

27:42.244 --> 27:44.662
and his testimony doesn't
mean anything to me yet.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.247
Keep working.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.760
- Excuse me.
- Which one of us?

27:58.886 --> 28:00.261
Both.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.181
- I'm gonna speak in code.
- Why?

28:03.265 --> 28:05.516
Because neither of you can suggest to a guest

28:05.601 --> 28:07.060
what they should say on the air.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.480
- Okay. I understand.
- You do?

28:10.564 --> 28:12.231
We've got Lisa. We've promo'd her.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.442
- She's done her job.
- She still has to show up.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.487
But you don't care
what she says once she does.

28:19.656 --> 28:20.823
I don't.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.868
So, do me a favor. This is for me.

28:23.952 --> 28:27.163
Get some statistics on the number
of missing children cases this year?

28:27.247 --> 28:30.792
Yes, please. And leave them for me
in the hair and makeup room.

28:35.798 --> 28:38.716
- You understood that?
- Yeah, I cracked your code.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.972
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.058
Jim, tell her she needs
a little blush to accentuate

28:47.142 --> 28:49.060
those gorgeous cheekbones.
She refuses to listen.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.228
I'm not auditioning for
Dancing With the Stars.

28:50.312 --> 28:51.479
My cheekbones are fine.

28:52.773 --> 28:53.815
She's fine.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.526
Could you give us the room a second?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.243
We're in a Vulcan mind-meld again.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.161
I can tell this is a bad time to ask...

29:07.246 --> 29:10.081
Maggie's my best friend.
She's actually my only friend, I think.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.999
And I'd chop off my ears before I'd hurt her.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.960
You're basing this all on the premise that...

29:14.044 --> 29:17.255
Don's a good guy who's not in love with her.

29:17.673 --> 29:18.965
She knows it.

29:19.842 --> 29:20.883
You're on deck, pal.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.846
I've been on deck for a year.
I'm nobody's second choice.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.265
Neither am I.

29:27.349 --> 29:30.435
- Well, I... I wasn't implying...
- Hey.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.814
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.068
Listen, why don't you take a look at this?

29:43.699 --> 29:45.074
You can take that out there
with you if you want.

29:45.159 --> 29:46.909
Keep it right on the desk.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.995
Will and MacKenzie won't mind?

29:50.456 --> 29:52.415
I'll see you after.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.548
- I was gonna say...
- I want to learn this.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.967
Please. Yeah.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.636
Thank you.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.308
You don't have to
say anything you don't mean.

30:12.102 --> 30:13.644
Okay.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.656
I'm joined now by Lisa Lambert,

30:25.741 --> 30:27.867
a friend of Casey Anthony's from high school.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.452
- Good evening, Lisa.
- Good evening.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.621
- Did you know Casey well?
- I didn't.

30:31.705 --> 30:34.665
And neither did any of the other people
showing up on TV claiming they did.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.083
But you took classes with her?

30:36.168 --> 30:37.293
Yes.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.628
Did she ever lose her temper?

30:39.087 --> 30:40.755
Yeah, and when she did, we all said,

30:40.839 --> 30:43.090
"Oh, my God,
she's gonna kill her baby one day."

30:43.842 --> 30:45.426
Fair enough. Let me ask you...

30:45.511 --> 30:47.470
There were 80 million children
reported missing last year.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.264
Actually, I think you mean 800,000.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.350
Yes.

30:52.434 --> 30:53.935
80 million would be way too many.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.854
And I understand.
But this one involves a murder.

30:56.939 --> 30:59.315
Olivia Garcia was one-year-old

30:59.399 --> 31:01.400
when she mysteriously died
at her babysitter's house.

31:01.485 --> 31:04.612
But Olivia Garcia had brown skin,
so we're not that interested.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.906
Same with Triumph Skinner,
a seven-month-old

31:06.990 --> 31:09.033
African-American who
was rushed to the hospital

31:09.117 --> 31:10.368
with a crushed skull.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.495
For some reason,
he's not keeping Nancy Grace up at night.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.788
Where are you getting these facts?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.415
Google.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.376
Jariel Alexander died

31:18.460 --> 31:21.087
after being knocked unconscious
by his mother's boyfriend

31:21.171 --> 31:23.422
and scalded with boiling water

31:23.507 --> 31:24.924
after soiling his pants at dinner.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.426
But Jariel's mother isn't pretty,
so what do we care?

31:27.511 --> 31:28.970
I think you're making a very good point.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.846
Then I'd like to make one more.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.061
What if Casey Anthony
had wanted an abortion?

31:37.145 --> 31:39.021
- She didn't want an abortion!
- Don't.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.106
She told you that?

31:40.190 --> 31:41.357
No, I haven't spoken to her in years.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.067
- I'm just asking.
- Is this you?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.027
- No.
- Do the people who care so deeply

31:45.320 --> 31:49.156
about the life of
a microscopic piece of biology

31:49.283 --> 31:50.241
with no ability to experience

31:50.325 --> 31:52.243
physical or emotional suffering

31:52.327 --> 31:54.870
care at all about a two-year-old
who was born to a mother

31:55.330 --> 31:58.457
who didn't want the child
and was unable to care for her?

31:58.875 --> 32:00.334
Help her out of this.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.169
Lisa, I just want to be clear for the viewers

32:02.254 --> 32:04.255
that you're not saying
Casey's only two options

32:04.339 --> 32:06.674
were abortion or murdering a toddler.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.805
I'm saying that there's an un-discussed

32:12.889 --> 32:14.599
and unappreciated cruelty

32:14.683 --> 32:16.726
in forcing a child to be born to a mother

32:16.810 --> 32:18.519
who doesn't want the child

32:18.604 --> 32:21.522
and isn't capable of raising the child.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.359
Okay, let's get back
to what Casey was like in high school.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.196
Where's a power outage
when you really need one?

32:44.379 --> 32:45.796
What's wrong?

33:04.483 --> 33:06.150
- You all right?
- Yeah.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.736
- How'd they know where you work?
- Her Facebook page.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.905
- Shut the page down.
- I'll take care of it.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.409
Hey.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.746
- Is she all right?
- Where's Lonny?

33:18.830 --> 33:20.748
You shouldn't be out alone.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.792
- You all right?
- Yeah.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.169
Are you mad I didn't tell you
I was gonna do that?

33:25.253 --> 33:26.420
No.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.214
I know you're pro-life.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.132
I'm not pro-throwing
a brick through a window.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.009
There are gonna be local news trucks here
any second.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.011
- Get her out of here.
- You, too.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.847
Is that your boss? The owner of the shop?

33:38.225 --> 33:39.392
I'm gonna talk to her.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.395
This should have been me and not you.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.320
Come on. Let's go.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.328
Teddy, is there something
different about these pants?

33:59.621 --> 34:00.788
Different from what?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.790
Every time I wear that suit, I mean every time,

34:02.874 --> 34:04.959
I put both my legs into one side of the pants.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.377
One side of the pants?

34:06.461 --> 34:08.629
I stand up, I put one leg into one side,

34:08.714 --> 34:10.631
and then I take my other leg
and I'm certainly aiming

34:10.716 --> 34:12.466
for the other side of the pants, but I get stuck.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.218
And I'm asking if there's something,

34:14.302 --> 34:15.970
not so much wrong,
but different about those pants.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.096
You can't put your pants on,

34:17.180 --> 34:19.223
and you think
there's something wrong with the pants?

34:19.307 --> 34:21.142
All right, get out.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.728
- Adam Roth is here.
- Yes.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.647
- Adam!
- Rock star.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.358
- How you doing, man?
- I'm good.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.277
- How's Emily?
- The whole family's great.

34:31.361 --> 34:34.321
David got into Stanford,
so thanks for the recommendation.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.116
I wrote him a pretty bad recommendation.
I'm surprised they took him.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.993
They must not care that much
about what you think.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.537
This is my partner at the RNC,

34:42.205 --> 34:43.497
- Tate Brady.
- Nice to meet you.

34:43.582 --> 34:44.665
- How do you do?
- Excellent.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.418
Charlie Skinner, MacKenzie McHale,
this is Adam Roth.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.004
Will talks about you
like you were bunkmates at summer camp.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.257
Well, we were,
but the summer camp was the White House

34:53.341 --> 34:55.384
and there was no bunk or sleep of any kind.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.095
I was Bush 41 's body man right out of college,

34:58.180 --> 34:59.889
and Will was writing greeting cards

34:59.973 --> 35:01.599
or something in the communications office.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.476
I wrote serious policy speeches.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.394
For the Muncie Chamber of Commerce.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.563
They were good speeches,

35:07.647 --> 35:09.398
and the president adopted Will

35:09.483 --> 35:11.400
as the fourth son he never had.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.944
The president knew my name,
and that's thanks to Adam.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.280
I'm sorry. This is his partner Greg Brady.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.740
- Tate.
- I'm sorry, Tate.

35:17.824 --> 35:21.494
Everybody sit down.
Anybody need coffee or anything?

35:21.578 --> 35:23.120
- I'm okay.
- I'm good.

35:23.205 --> 35:25.790
So we're glad to see
your numbers rebounded from last week.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.292
We hadn't been covering Casey Anthony

35:28.376 --> 35:29.877
and half our audience went to HLN.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.962
But we started covering it,
and things stabilized.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.257
Well, good, because we were
about ready to offer a debate to Nancy Grace.

35:37.511 --> 35:39.804
So the rules of the debate are pretty simple.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.765
There is some room for you to
make a few choices, but not much.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.642
Everybody gets an opening statement.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.394
Everybody gets at least two questions
with 60 seconds to answer

35:47.479 --> 35:50.231
and it's up to you
whether you want to offer someone a rebuttal.

35:51.024 --> 35:53.234
We had something different in mind.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.318
What'd you have in mind?

35:54.402 --> 35:56.612
Adam, how many hours did you and I spend

35:56.696 --> 35:58.239
talking about how flawed the debates were?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.699
Especially the primary debates?

36:00.784 --> 36:02.201
A lot of hours.

36:02.285 --> 36:05.246
Well, now you and I are
in a position to do something about that.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.580
Follow me.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.459
The questions have to be tougher.

36:10.544 --> 36:13.504
They have to be able
to square their campaign rhetoric with facts.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.714
They have to be stopped
when they're not answering the question,

36:15.799 --> 36:18.509
and they have to be called out
when their answers contradict the facts.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.927
Guys, get in place.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.762
Our job is to find the two candidates

36:21.847 --> 36:23.681
who'll give the voters
the best competing arguments,

36:23.765 --> 36:25.140
and I don't believe we're seeing that.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.892
We have to put the candidates
on a witness stand.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.311
- Would you have them swear an oath?
- Just let 'em do it.

36:29.396 --> 36:31.647
If baseball players testifying about steroids

36:31.731 --> 36:33.858
in front of a House Subcommittee
are subject to perjury,

36:33.942 --> 36:35.359
I don't know
why presidential candidates aren't.

36:35.443 --> 36:39.280
But I'm not reaching for the stars,
I'm reaching just an inch higher.

36:39.865 --> 36:43.117
Welcome to Princeton University
in Princeton, New Jersey,

36:43.201 --> 36:47.496
for the fifth debate
in the 2012 Republican primary race,

36:47.581 --> 36:51.750
cosponsored by Atlantis Cable News
and the Republican Party of New Jersey.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.879
At which point we'll explain the rules,
which is there are no rules.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.547
I question a candidate until I'm done.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.340
They can each make an opening statement.

36:58.633 --> 37:01.218
Beginning with you,
Congresswoman Bachmann.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.095
Hi, my name is Michele Bachmann.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.972
I'm a former federal tax litigation attorney,

37:05.307 --> 37:07.683
the owner of a successful company,
and also a member...

37:07.767 --> 37:10.978
Hang on. Is that supposed to be
a Michele Bachmann impersonation?

37:11.062 --> 37:12.897
No, nobody's doing impressions.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.189
This isn't an SNL sketch.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.692
These people have spent two months
studying stump speeches,

37:16.776 --> 37:19.987
interviews, on-the-record statements,
previous debate performances

37:20.071 --> 37:21.864
in order to come as close
as possible to answering

37:21.948 --> 37:23.949
our questions the way the candidates would.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.911
After the opening statements,
we'd move to questioning.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.788
Senator Santorum,
you said that your campaign

37:29.873 --> 37:32.249
is about freedom, and that 20 years from now,

37:32.334 --> 37:33.959
you don't want to be
telling your grandchildren

37:34.044 --> 37:35.878
how America once was free.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.255
Name three freedoms you had the day before

37:38.340 --> 37:41.008
President Obama was sworn in
that you don't have now.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.384
ObamaCare, to begin with.

37:42.469 --> 37:43.886
ObamaCare is the most egregious...

37:43.970 --> 37:45.763
Have you had to change doctors?

37:45.847 --> 37:47.431
- May I finish?
- No, sir.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.642
- Have you had to change doctors?
- No.

37:49.851 --> 37:52.186
Has anyone in your family
had to change doctors?

37:52.270 --> 37:55.105
Has there been any change at all
in health care for you or your family?

37:55.190 --> 37:56.732
I'm talking about ObamaCare now.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.276
My question was
name three freedoms that you had

37:59.361 --> 38:02.237
the day before the president was sworn in
that you don't have now.

38:02.322 --> 38:04.365
Mr. Speaker, you just said
that if you're elected,

38:04.449 --> 38:07.117
the price of gas will be $2.50 a gallon.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.995
How does the US President
control the price of oil?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.497
Governor, you've said that as president

38:11.581 --> 38:13.707
you will never apologize for America.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.459
This question is in two parts.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.378
Name an instance in which the president

38:17.462 --> 38:19.129
has apologized for America,

38:19.214 --> 38:21.298
and can you imagine no instance

38:21.383 --> 38:24.051
in which a US president
should apologize for America?

38:24.135 --> 38:26.387
Mr. McAvoy, I find it reprehensible

38:26.471 --> 38:29.264
that the liberal media would try to
pit Republicans against one another.

38:29.349 --> 38:31.308
And I, for one, won't stand by
while it happens.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.268
This is the Republican primary, Mr. Speaker,

38:33.353 --> 38:34.895
and you're running for the nomination.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.398
It wasn't my idea to pit you against anyone.
It was yours.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.192
Congressman Paul,
I'd like to discuss the newsletters

38:40.276 --> 38:42.528
you wrote and sold starting in the 1990s.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.321
I've already said
everything I have to say.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.365
I never wrote those letters
and I never even read them.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.449
They had your name on them.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.742
They had your signature on them.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.370
You made money from them.
And in 1996, you defended them

38:51.454 --> 38:52.955
to the Dallas Morning News.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.167
- I don't like pretending...
- Stop. Everybody, stop.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.420
There's no need to go along any further.

38:59.546 --> 39:00.921
I see where you're going.

39:02.382 --> 39:03.549
- Adam.
- Listen...

39:03.633 --> 39:05.884
Is there someplace we can talk privately?

39:06.636 --> 39:07.636
Take my office.

39:09.139 --> 39:10.639
Adam.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.237
I think they really liked it.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.993
You did a good job, everybody.
Give me a minute.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.878
- I told you, this guy...
- This guy what?

39:42.547 --> 39:43.547
Wasn't on the team.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.674
- He's on the team, okay?
- Hang on.

39:45.759 --> 39:47.301
The team I'm on is the voters'

39:47.594 --> 39:50.387
and smart, qualified people
disagreeing about issues.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.097
Your plan was to
embarrass the candidates.

39:52.182 --> 39:54.224
I want candidates
who can answer those questions.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.685
And if they know they're going to be
held responsible for the nonsense

39:56.770 --> 39:59.354
they're shouting on the stump,
they'll be forced to stop shouting nonsense.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.398
- This guy has lost his mind.
- He hasn't.

40:01.483 --> 40:03.901
Adam, this is exactly
what we always talked about.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.277
This is what we dreamed of.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.154
We said we need real campaign reform

40:07.238 --> 40:09.865
and a way of letting Americans hear
the two best competing arguments.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.326
Nobody could stand up
to that kind of questioning.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.995
- You think that was brutal questioning?
- It really wasn't.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.499
And you honestly believe the candidates
would submit themselves to this?

40:18.583 --> 40:20.751
- They should welcome it.
- I don't believe what I'm hearing.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.419
Any candidate who can handle a cross

40:22.504 --> 40:24.922
is gonna find himself
at the top of the polls in the morning.

40:25.006 --> 40:28.175
And we should welcome it
'cause it'll clear out the clown car

40:28.259 --> 40:30.844
and give us a serious discussion
among serious candidates.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.262
The only person
who would welcome it is him.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.348
This is about him. He wants to look tough

40:34.432 --> 40:35.974
by making the candidates look like idiots.

40:36.059 --> 40:39.645
No, he doesn't. I have known this man
for 25 years and I vouch...

40:39.729 --> 40:41.480
I don't care what you vouch for.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.273
I am not allowing the goddamn press

40:43.358 --> 40:45.692
to make fools out of our candidates.

40:46.027 --> 40:49.863
I'll remember that the next time you bitch
about how the press never vetted Obama.

40:53.701 --> 40:54.952
We're not agreeing to this format.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.454
You are going to abide
by the rules that we give you,

40:58.665 --> 41:01.250
and I don't want MacKenzie McHale
producing it for you.

41:03.545 --> 41:04.795
What are you talking about?

41:04.879 --> 41:07.005
I want the old Will McAvoy.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.465
Not the thing she turned you into.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.342
I know all about that lady.

41:28.361 --> 41:31.446
- Get out.
- Will, come on. You need the debate.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.823
Of course he can use MacKenzie.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.534
These guys have been compromising
and compromising all week

41:35.618 --> 41:38.453
so we could host a debate that
made some sense and did some good.

41:38.538 --> 41:39.538
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

41:39.622 --> 41:40.706
because it was all for nothing.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.499
- We need ACN.
- No, we don't.

41:42.584 --> 41:43.917
They've got the independents.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.460
He's not the only anchor at ACN.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.673
- Don Keefer.
- Yeah?

41:49.757 --> 41:52.759
How would you and Elliot Hirsch
like to have one of the debates?

41:53.052 --> 41:54.636
Eat me.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.183
- Mr. Skinner, I'm trying to be as...
- When Don says, "Eat me,"

41:59.267 --> 42:01.643
that's usually the end of the conversation.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.229
Sloan Sabbith.

42:05.106 --> 42:06.773
- You want to be a star?
- Me?

42:06.858 --> 42:08.442
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

42:13.740 --> 42:15.115
I hate these guys.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.743
I don't know why you don't.

42:17.827 --> 42:19.620
And I'll be in the car.

42:32.592 --> 42:34.343
I'm really sorry.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.805
I can't be out of work.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.725
- Tuition at Stanford is...
- No, I know.

42:43.269 --> 42:44.436
It was good seeing you.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.897
You, too.

42:47.607 --> 42:50.359
All those things we talked about...

42:50.443 --> 42:51.777
Yeah.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.988
Don't let 'em push you around.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.410
You take it easy.

43:18.137 --> 43:19.846
I'm sorry, everyone.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.350
We lost the debate.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.733
I'm sorry.

43:42.078 --> 43:44.371
We've got about an hour to air.
Let's put it together.

43:50.545 --> 43:52.713
He'll cave.
He'll agree to the debate on their terms.

43:52.839 --> 43:55.048
- No, he won't.
- You romanticize Will.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.217
That mock debate was about him.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.136
He was the star. He attacked his...

43:59.220 --> 44:00.804
He didn't attack anybody.

44:00.888 --> 44:02.973
He asked questions that
the candidates should be able to answer

44:03.057 --> 44:05.309
and that the voters should
be able to hear them answer.

44:05.393 --> 44:07.602
He didn't cower and he wasn't Ed McMahon.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.187
Thinking there was even a remote chance...

44:09.272 --> 44:11.982
- Maybe it was naive.
- It wasn't naive, it was hubris.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.108
It was gutsy, and you're just jealous.

44:13.192 --> 44:16.236
Jealous of what? You know, fuck you, Mac.

44:17.113 --> 44:18.864
I've spent this week letting you kick my ass

44:18.948 --> 44:21.158
from here to the Chrysler Building
because you were selling out

44:21.242 --> 44:23.702
every 15 minutes to get your hands on
something you didn't get.

44:23.786 --> 44:25.996
And you were embarrassed by it
in front of me.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.497
He doesn't want you.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.166
Please don't talk about my personal life.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.584
I'm sort of a key player in it.

44:30.752 --> 44:32.586
Is it all right if I talk about my personal life?

44:32.670 --> 44:34.838
Yes, I broke up with you. I'm the first guy ever

44:34.922 --> 44:36.715
to break up with a woman.
And then I came back.

44:36.799 --> 44:38.925
Also unprecedented. Did he come back?

44:39.802 --> 44:40.844
I don't know yet.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.804
Seriously? After four years?

44:42.889 --> 44:45.849
In CastAway, Helen Hunt got
remarried in less time than...

44:48.102 --> 44:49.853
I never would have gone
with the Casey Anthony story.

44:49.937 --> 44:51.855
I don't care how much
of my audience I was losing.

44:51.939 --> 44:53.357
And he's gonna cave on the debate, too.

44:53.441 --> 44:56.485
- Are you sure about that?
- I am absolutely sure about that.

44:56.569 --> 44:58.195
You know what I like about Will?

44:58.279 --> 45:02.366
He's not absolutely sure about anything.

45:02.450 --> 45:03.700
He struggles with things.

45:03.785 --> 45:05.952
He's never certain he's right,
and sometimes he's not.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.871
But he tries hard to be.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.082
He struggles with things.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.667
God!

45:12.752 --> 45:14.961
Will, are you all right?

45:15.296 --> 45:16.880
Could somebody help Will put his pants on?

45:21.386 --> 45:23.011
I don't think this is gonna work out.

45:23.471 --> 45:25.389
- The story?
- Yeah.

45:25.473 --> 45:26.515
That's Will's call.

45:28.476 --> 45:29.935
Excuse me.

45:30.478 --> 45:31.645
How's it going there?

45:31.729 --> 45:33.730
There's something off with these pants.

45:33.815 --> 45:35.607
I think maybe considering
everything that's gone on here

45:35.691 --> 45:37.901
this week, you should reconsider
having Brian write the piece.

45:37.985 --> 45:38.985
Can you handle him being here?

45:39.070 --> 45:40.070
I can handle him being here.

45:40.154 --> 45:41.822
- But I think...
- I brought him in here to punish you.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.824
- I know.
- I think I may have also brought him in here

45:43.908 --> 45:46.827
- so you could see a side-by-side comparison.
- You're an idiot.

45:46.911 --> 45:49.162
- Hey, these are really hard pants.
- Not the pants.

45:49.455 --> 45:52.082
I have cooperated with
and been the engine behind

45:52.166 --> 45:55.168
an instant dismantling of everything
we've built and everything we stand for.

45:55.503 --> 45:58.588
I've ignored serious stories
so we can get down in the gutter

45:58.673 --> 46:01.299
with the Casey Anthony circus
and the Anthony Weiner distraction.

46:01.384 --> 46:03.677
And I've done it all
while Brian's been standing

46:03.803 --> 46:05.846
over my shoulder, because you put him there.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.932
And you pass on the debate
because that guy insulted me?

46:09.016 --> 46:10.267
Who are you?

46:10.351 --> 46:14.187
I don't know where your head is at,
at any given moment!

46:14.272 --> 46:17.065
I am this close to losing it! I think I have!

46:17.150 --> 46:18.900
I think it's happening right now!

46:19.026 --> 46:21.403
- Settle down.
- I will not settle down!

46:21.487 --> 46:24.239
I should, though.
I should settle down.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.284
Remember your first day here, the BP spill?

46:27.368 --> 46:28.326
Yeah.

46:28.411 --> 46:30.412
Remember when I said
throw out the rundown?

46:30.496 --> 46:33.373
- Yeah.
- Did you think that was cool?

46:33.666 --> 46:34.749
Yeah.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.210
Throw out the rundown.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.129
Wait, no.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.506
We still need the numbers.
We've got to protect you from Leona.

46:41.591 --> 46:44.301
Yeah, I can't live with a 15-year-old girl
being the toughest guy at my desk.

46:44.385 --> 46:45.594
- Are you talking about Lisa?
- Yeah.

46:45.678 --> 46:48.096
- She's 26.
- They all look 15 to me. Sloan.

46:48.181 --> 46:49.806
- Are you sure about this?
- Not at all.

46:49.891 --> 46:51.600
- Yeah?
- If I ask you the right questions,

46:51.684 --> 46:54.728
can you talk about the debt ceiling
for two segments tonight?

46:54.812 --> 46:57.230
- I don't even need the questions.
- Get ready.

46:57.315 --> 46:59.107
Can you handle Brian being here
a little while longer?

46:59.442 --> 47:00.609
I can handle anything.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.986
- Jellyfish.
- I don't like jellyfish.

47:03.070 --> 47:04.529
- Brian.
- Yeah?

47:04.947 --> 47:07.616
Just write the truth, okay?
Just write the truth.

47:12.205 --> 47:14.915
We're throwing out the rundown
and leading with the debt ceiling.

47:17.919 --> 47:19.586
- You get all that?
- Yeah.

47:22.215 --> 47:23.715
Is it working?

47:23.799 --> 47:25.717
No. They're laughing at me.

47:25.801 --> 47:27.677
They think I'm a small-time troll.

47:27.762 --> 47:29.930
- That's got to hurt.
- It does.

47:30.264 --> 47:32.474
It's too bad you're not the guy
who left the death threat for Will.

47:37.605 --> 47:38.939
That's a dangerous area.

47:40.358 --> 47:41.483
Yeah.

48:16.811 --> 48:18.144
Jim?

48:18.938 --> 48:20.188
Yeah?

48:21.732 --> 48:23.608
Whatever happened with you and Lisa?

48:25.653 --> 48:27.988
She doesn't want to go out with me.

48:29.991 --> 48:31.700
I gave it a try.

48:31.784 --> 48:33.410
A try?

48:34.203 --> 48:35.245
Yeah.

48:38.124 --> 48:41.084
"Gather ye rosebuds."
You know what that means?

48:41.168 --> 48:44.796
It's the first half of the first line
of a poem by Robert Herrick.

48:44.964 --> 48:46.298
What's the second half?

48:48.342 --> 48:49.551
"While ye may."

48:51.804 --> 48:54.347
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."

49:01.355 --> 49:02.689
I'm gonna.

49:07.194 --> 49:09.321
"Then be not coy, but use your time,

49:09.405 --> 49:12.365
"And while ye may go marry:

49:12.450 --> 49:14.326
"For having lost but once your prime,

49:14.410 --> 49:16.036
"You may forever tarry."

49:17.038 --> 49:18.079
I won't.

49:18.164 --> 49:19.706
Okay.

49:22.543 --> 49:24.544
- First we have to do the show.
- Yeah.

49:35.723 --> 49:37.223
You're 100% sure?

49:37.391 --> 49:39.726
It was a year ago.
It was over a year ago.

49:40.227 --> 49:42.020
He was the new guy in the office,

49:42.104 --> 49:44.648
and Don and I were in a terrible place.

49:44.732 --> 49:47.525
So I had a stupid crush on him
for five minutes.

49:47.610 --> 49:49.402
He was nice to me
even though I was mean to him,

49:49.487 --> 49:51.613
so I thought maybe he liked me, too.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.948
But that's just over,

49:54.033 --> 49:56.034
and he's really trying hard with you.

49:56.118 --> 49:57.827
- So if you like him...
- Of course I like him.

49:57.995 --> 49:59.329
There's no way to
fix the air conditioning.

49:59.413 --> 50:00.955
Your choices are 90 degrees or 30 degrees.

50:01.207 --> 50:03.500
Who's here at midnight?

50:07.046 --> 50:09.464
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Jim.

50:10.758 --> 50:12.092
Come on up.

50:14.762 --> 50:16.680
We never got to the God question.

50:16.764 --> 50:19.683
Bachmann said that God told her to run,
and Maggie wanted Will to ask her

50:19.767 --> 50:22.185
what God's voice sounded like.
I think it would have sealed it for us.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.896
If every network said,
"We're not playing by your rules.

50:24.980 --> 50:27.607
"You're playing by ours,"
we'd raise the level of debate overnight.

50:27.733 --> 50:29.359
It wasn't as crazy as it sounded.

50:29.443 --> 50:30.694
It was exactly as crazy as it sounded.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.779
Good luck.

50:36.784 --> 50:37.909
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:37.993 --> 50:39.703
- I wanted to talk to...
- Hey, man.

50:40.663 --> 50:41.955
Hey, Don.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.290
I did... I didn't know that you'd...

50:44.375 --> 50:46.209
Maggie talked me into it.

50:47.002 --> 50:48.336
I'm sorry?

50:48.421 --> 50:50.130
You don't have to pitch me.

50:50.297 --> 50:51.965
Maggie talked me into it.

51:04.311 --> 51:06.062
- Let's go for a walk.
- Listen...

51:06.147 --> 51:07.230
Let's go.

51:14.155 --> 51:15.613
Nice ending, don't you think?

51:16.115 --> 51:18.491
He had a whole speech he didn't get to use.

51:21.328 --> 51:22.495
Don?

51:27.209 --> 51:28.209
What is it?

51:30.838 --> 51:32.547
He said, "I wanted to talk to..."

51:32.631 --> 51:34.007
And then I cut him off.

51:36.343 --> 51:37.385
What are you...

51:37.470 --> 51:39.471
Lisa wasn't the one he came here to see.

51:41.557 --> 51:43.016
I don't...

51:43.851 --> 51:45.435
He signed for the flowers.

51:47.021 --> 51:48.188
What?

51:48.981 --> 51:50.648
I have to explain something.

52:03.204 --> 52:04.537
Congresswoman Bachmann,
to you.

52:04.622 --> 52:06.790
Elvis or Johnny Cash?

52:06.874 --> 52:08.500
Oh, that's really tough.

52:08.584 --> 52:11.127
That's really... Both. Both.

52:11.212 --> 52:12.212
Both?

52:12.296 --> 52:14.380
Yeah, I've got Christmas With Elvis
on my iPod.

52:16.592 --> 52:18.885
All right, now we know
what's on the congresswoman's iPod.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.409
This is Lonny.

53:24.493 --> 53:25.535
- Lonny, it's Neal.
- Yeah?

53:25.619 --> 53:27.287
I'm sorry to call you so late,
but I need to tell you

53:27.371 --> 53:29.539
about something that's
on my computer right now.

53:29.623 --> 53:32.125
I've been working on this story,
and without going into detail...
