there are allegations

that Sabre printers
can cause a fire.

When Mama was working
as a prison guard,

she'd ask one question,

"What do we do
when we find
the guilty party?"

Darryl and Pam

09:42.873 --> 09:45.292

for something l said.

what you're saying to me.

So, l'll see you
in Meredith's van
in five minutes.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.560
Okay, you didn't need
to actually say that.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.480
l have never seen
so many parking tickets.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.608
All right,
this is just messed up.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.318
No, you know
what's messed up?

10:11.402 --> 10:14.613
This situation
all up in here
is what's messed up.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.698
We need to brainstorm,
we need to get out of this.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.618
Brain-hurricane, come on.
Think. What have we got?

10:19.702 --> 10:20.827

Hey, guys,
sorry l'm late.

She also whistle-blew.

Guys, l couldn't help it.
lt is so boring
where we work.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.463
l mean, it's as interesting
as a morgue.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.465
lt might be less interesting
than a morgue.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.967
Hey, hey, it's as
interesting as a morgue.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.345
Of course l'm the leak.
l think l tweeted it.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.804
l can't control
what l say to people.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.014

the whole day talking.

l skype, l text,
l tweet, l phone, l woof.

10:45.686 --> 10:46.936
Woof is a site that
l'm launching to be

10:47.021 --> 10:48.647

l say we just smash
all the computers.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.092
We destroy the evidence.
No evidence, no case.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.469
Wouldn't we get fired
for smashing
all the computers?

11:19.553 --> 11:22.681
No, okay,
not all the computers.
Just our computers.

one scapegoat.

l'm turning in Darryl.

That's just what we need,

Nobody's going
to prison. Okay?

11:41.534 --> 11:45.245
All right, Michael,
you need to convince
Jo to go easy on us.

And then we'll
all confess once we know
our jobs are safe.

count on me.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.151
Hey, Jo.
Michael.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.028
l was thinking about
our little leak problem.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.280
l was up all lunch
thinking about

12:20.364 --> 12:22.198
what we should do
to this individual.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.034
You know what l
think we should do?

12:25.119 --> 12:28.580
We make them
come to work.
And we work them,

12:28.664 --> 12:31.958
and we make them sit
next to all the people
they screwed over.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.586
And we pay them,

12:34.670 --> 12:39.132
but we make them
feel like they did
something really wrong.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.634
The one question
l have is, "Do we give them
a Christmas bonus?"

12:41.802 --> 12:44.304
l say yes, it's Christmas,

12:44.388 --> 12:47.682

then tell me.
Why?

12:58.694 --> 13:01.237
Because l wanna deal with it
the way l deal with it.

Well, deal with this.

like it was you.

that it was Andy for now

seems a little unfair.

we don't definitely
know it was Andy.

it could have been Jim.

l am not going to
tell you anything.

Honey, you don't seem
like your normal self.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.299
Well, l'm going through
a little bit of
a rough patch.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.384
Mama Jo knew
there was something up.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.345
The whole year, actually.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.139
My favorite restaurant
closed down.
Oh.

15:33.557 --> 15:34.766
l hate that.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.435
And my new favorite
restaurant sucks.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.231
l bought a video camera
last year

15:42.316 --> 15:44.025
and l was looking
at the tapes,

15:44.360 --> 15:48.196
and there were only,
like, 1 2 minutes that
l felt was worth taping.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.822
The whole year.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.784
And most of that
was just birds in
my condo complex.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.452
What is that?

15:57.289 --> 15:58.706

from an old client

the news to other clients

to talk about that.

he might have
been a terrorist.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.770
You deserve it.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.357
ANDY: Look, l didn't want
houses and schooIs

19:53.442 --> 19:55.818
to burn down
and chiIdren to die.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.946
Does that make me a hero?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.907
KEVlN: No, it does not.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.995
Well, it doesn't make me
the worst guy in the world,
either.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.288
ANGELA: lt does!

20:09.791 --> 20:11.667
Andy?
Hey.

20:12.127 --> 20:16.923
l wanted to say that
l think it was very brave
of you to go to the press.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.723
Thanks.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.309
Yeah, you know.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.562
Just seemed like
the right thing to do.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.647
Yeah.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.029
"We at Sabre have
betrayed the trust

20:40.113 --> 20:42.240
"that we have built
with our customers.

20:42.324 --> 20:46.410
"We regret our slow response
and our lapse in
candor and judgment.

20:46.995 --> 20:51.958
"At this time,
we are issuing a full recall
of all Sabre GH400 printers.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.127
"We will not rest
until this problem
is solved.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.547
"There will be no questions."
Are there any questions?

21:04.179 --> 21:07.431
Hey, l appreciate you
reading that statement.
You looked pretty up there.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.724
That was fun.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.601
l hope your rough patch
ends soon.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.019
Thanks. Today helped.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.189
Well, give a shout
if l can brighten your life.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.526
Okay. Hey, you could
transfer Holly back
from Nashua.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.488
Let me see what l can do.
