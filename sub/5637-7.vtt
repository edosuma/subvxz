Myself and spencer are big swing

Votes, and all I know is I'm
glad I have the necklace,

28:56.001 --> 28:58.135
Glad I have the necklace,
because it's going to be one

28:58.137 --> 29:01.238
Because it's going to be one
hell of a tribal.

29:18.923 --> 29:25.963
>> good job, brother.
>> first immunity challenge, I

29:25.965 --> 29:26.864

29:26.866 --> 29:28.432
Just wanted to win.
I wanted to make a statement.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.134
I wanted to make a statement.

I wanted to show I can hang with
them.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.876

Ciera right behind her.
They're coming up with lies,

29:50.589 --> 29:51.588
They're coming up with lies,
they're almost believable.

29:51.590 --> 29:52.756
They're almost believable.
That's what's so dangerous about

29:52.758 --> 29:53.590
That's what's so dangerous about
them.

29:53.592 --> 29:54.992
Them.
But from my perspective,'d

29:54.994 --> 29:56.326
But from my perspective,'d
rather have ciera go.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.095
Rather have ciera go.
Ly never forget what ciera did.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.931
Ly never forget what ciera did.
And in my mind she's done.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.900

30:06.672 --> 30:07.571
>> I will tell you guys, I can't
trust ciera.

30:07.573 --> 30:08.405
Trust ciera.
She's super dangerous.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.007
She's super dangerous.
She makes up these lies that are

30:10.009 --> 30:13.177
She makes up these lies that are
kind of believable.

30:13.179 --> 30:13.710
Kind of believable.
They're always...

30:13.712 --> 30:15.946
They're always...

I thought kass was much worst.
>> I think they're both feeding

30:18.951 --> 30:19.349

off each other.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.751
Off each other.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.087
>> I feel like kass is kind of
stirring up the most right now.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.023
Stirring up the most right now.
>> with this vote I'd rather

30:26.025 --> 30:26.690
>> with this vote I'd rather
have ciera go.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.458
Have ciera go.
She is so dangerous.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.527
She is so dangerous.
For me she's public enemy number

30:30.529 --> 30:31.762
For me she's public enemy number
one and has to go.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.831
One and has to go.

>> at this point if the majority
wants kass, sometimes it's best

30:40.439 --> 30:41.805
Wants kass, sometimes it's best
just to go with the majority,

30:41.807 --> 30:43.540
Just to go with the majority,
because kass is almost a little

30:43.542 --> 30:45.709
Because kass is almost a little
ruthless and a little bit

30:45.711 --> 30:50.214
Ruthless and a little bit
haphazard, and that scares me.

30:50.216 --> 30:54.251
Haphazard, and that scares me.
>> as far as who you want to do?

30:54.253 --> 30:58.422
>> as far as who you want to do?
It's got to be someone who is

30:58.424 --> 30:59.189

>> I've been conflicted about
which way to go, but I feel the

31:15.174 --> 31:17.841
Which way to go, but I feel the
numbers going where they're

31:17.843 --> 31:19.176
Numbers going where they're
going, and not stopping to wait

31:19.178 --> 31:20.077
Going, and not stopping to wait
for me.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.612
For me.

last vote that was willing to

31:22.648 --> 31:25.148
Last vote that was willing to
play with me, and even though I

31:26.852 --> 31:30.020
Want to save her, I'm not sure I
can.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.488
Can.
>> I don't think she does.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.657
>> I don't think she does.
>> it looks like everybody is

31:33.659 --> 31:34.825

Just briefly asked how things
were going, and the response I

34:58.030 --> 35:01.932
