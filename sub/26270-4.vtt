WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:02.903
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:02.936 --> 00:04.972
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.005 --> 00:06.807
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.840 --> 00:08.476
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.509 --> 00:11.579
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.482
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.583
Only on Fox.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.888
(alarm blaring)

00:20.921 --> 00:22.923
(alarm stops)

00:30.431 --> 00:31.932
("Milagro" by Gloria Estefan
playing)

00:33.934 --> 00:35.936
Rise and shine, little man.

00:40.474 --> 00:44.578
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.614
(Christopher grunting)

00:49.950 --> 00:51.952
Keep going, my little Superman.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.424
-Whoa.
-Oh, a little bit too much.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.459
Let's share it.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.126
(sighs):
Finally.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.402
MADDIE:
The Oxford Dictionary
defines "rut"

01:41.435 --> 01:44.772
as "a habit or pattern of
behavior that has become dull

01:44.805 --> 01:47.241
and unproductive
but is hard to change."

01:47.275 --> 01:50.244
The word is also defined
as "a long, deep track

01:50.278 --> 01:53.647
made by the repeated passage
of the wheels of vehicles."

01:53.681 --> 01:57.285
There is some comfort to be
taken in the second definition,

01:57.318 --> 01:59.620
for when you find yourself
stuck in a rut,

01:59.653 --> 02:02.556
you can be sure others
have been there before you.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.626
(clattering)

02:05.659 --> 02:07.828
(indistinct chatter)

02:08.862 --> 02:11.665
Son of a bitch.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.534
Dwayne, it's George.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.703
Those ninja street artist guys
are back again, man.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.338
DWAYNE:
Hold the button down.
I can't hear you.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.040
Hey! Don't you move.

02:21.008 --> 02:21.975
No, no!

02:22.009 --> 02:22.976
I said don't move!

02:23.010 --> 02:25.513
Don't move!

02:34.255 --> 02:35.456
(grunts)

02:35.489 --> 02:38.025
Come back! Oh, God!

02:38.058 --> 02:39.693
(grunting)

02:42.663 --> 02:43.764
Aah!

03:03.217 --> 03:05.419
LAFD. Step back.

03:05.453 --> 03:09.257
GEORGE:
Please help me! Please help me!

03:09.290 --> 03:12.159
Someone help me, please!

03:12.192 --> 03:13.761
CHIMNEY:
Whoa.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.930
Whatever you do, brother,
don't suck in that gut.

03:16.964 --> 03:20.501
-BOBBY: How we doing, George?
-I can't... I can't
feel my legs.

03:20.534 --> 03:24.004
And I think my ankle's broken.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.507
HEN:
Sir, you have any idea
how long you've been down there?

03:26.540 --> 03:29.410
I saw the sun come up.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.745
Well, he's wedged in there
pretty good.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.780
How's your breathing?

03:32.813 --> 03:35.283
I can't really
take a deep breath.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.185
Hey, George, can-can you show us
how high up you can reach?

03:38.218 --> 03:41.255
If we can drop you a line,
we may be able to pull you up.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.990
-Okay.
-HEN: Nice and slow, George.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.260
BUCK:
That's it.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.095
-(screams)
-Whoa, easy.
-George, just...

03:48.128 --> 03:50.564
keep hanging in there,
we will get you out.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.866
What are you thinking, Cap?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.202
(knocking)

03:55.235 --> 03:57.971
-Yes?
-Ma'am, we need
to access this unit.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.607
-Uh...
-Let's go, start with the drill.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.610
Uh, I'm in the middle
of a private showing.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.144
Hi.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.750
(shouts)

04:09.783 --> 04:11.251
Oh, oh, oh, no!

04:11.285 --> 04:13.220
(muffled):
Help! Help!

04:13.253 --> 04:15.055
-A little high, boss.
One second.
-Someone get me out of here!

04:15.088 --> 04:16.624
Sorry about that.
One second.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.159
That's your target.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.834
(grunting)

04:26.867 --> 04:29.169
Why couldn't you go through
the wall of the other building?

04:29.202 --> 04:30.771
Ma'am, as I explained before,

04:30.804 --> 04:32.740
the wall in the other building
is twice as thick.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.308
It would take twice
as much time.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.444
And this is all gonna
be taken care of.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.483
Yeah.
It's good to go, Cap.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.818
All right, George, I'm-a need
you to control your breathing

04:44.852 --> 04:45.853
and take shallow breaths.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.524
(drill whirring)

04:50.558 --> 04:52.493
Let's get down there.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.294
GEORGE:
I think you should talk to me!

04:54.328 --> 04:56.129
All right, we're almost there,
George. How you holding up?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.798
Uh, please hurry, 'cause...

04:57.831 --> 04:59.533
I got to take a leak.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.435
Okay, maybe hold off
on that for a minute.

05:01.469 --> 05:04.004
Okay, George, we're gonna start
to pull you in here, but

05:04.037 --> 05:06.640
in order to do that, we're gonna
have to pull on you pretty hard.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.308
So you're probably gonna feel
like you're falling,

05:08.342 --> 05:10.711
but you're not. If you start
to panic and struggle,

05:10.744 --> 05:12.880
it's gonna be hard for us to get
you in here. Do you understand?

05:12.913 --> 05:15.148
Just don't dro...
don't drop me, please.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.050
I don't want to die.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.719
Relax, everything's
gonna be okay.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.321
-GEORGE: Okay.
-All right?

05:21.355 --> 05:23.691
All right, take a breath
and just exhale. Ready?

05:23.724 --> 05:26.293
-GEORGE: Yeah.
-One, two, three.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.328
Start to pull.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.330
Aah!

05:30.364 --> 05:32.866
-Here. Give me your hand.
All right, you're safe.
-(whimpering)

05:32.900 --> 05:34.635
All right.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.638
Okay, you're home free, George.
Watch your head. Okay.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.573
You're okay.
You're okay.

05:39.607 --> 05:40.974
Okay, okay, okay.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.309
-HEN: All right, take it easy.
-BOBBY: Okay, guys,

05:42.342 --> 05:45.379
on three:
one, two, three.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.581
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.717
You're gonna be just fine.
You're gonna be just fine, okay?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.852
Okay...

05:51.885 --> 05:54.888
Who knew having a gut
was gonna save my life?

06:02.863 --> 06:06.199
-Captain?
-Athena. Come on in.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.868
Would you shut the door
behind you?

06:07.901 --> 06:10.504
You look worried.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.040
Well, I'm not sure we've ever
had a good conversation

06:13.073 --> 06:15.943
that started with
"shut the door behind you."

06:15.976 --> 06:19.046
Well, then,
this will be a first.

06:19.079 --> 06:23.083
You applied for a promotion
to lieutenant four times,

06:23.116 --> 06:25.853
but then you stopped applying.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.254
Why?

06:27.287 --> 06:30.057
I was passed over...
four times.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.427
When I pressed the issue,
I was told

06:33.461 --> 06:36.597
that, um, I didn't have the
necessary leadership qualities

06:36.630 --> 06:38.599
for further advancement.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.535
-Conners, right?
-Mm-hmm.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.271
Spent the entire conversation
staring at your chest?

06:44.304 --> 06:47.975
I never understood
what that was about.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.811
Was it a sexual thing, or was
he just constantly surprised

06:50.844 --> 06:52.713
that there were police officers
who had breasts?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.882
-Well, he was
a real son of a bitch.
-Ugh.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.250
May he rest in peace.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.953
Conners was wrong about,
well, everything,

06:59.987 --> 07:03.791
but specifically, about
your leadership skills.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.226
You're tough, but fair.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.930
Well-respected with the officers
under your command.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.733
And I think you would make
an excellent lieutenant.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.735
Thank you, Captain. Um,

07:14.768 --> 07:17.838
but I haven't even thought
about applying in years.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.973
Maybe next year.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.142
How about next week?

07:22.175 --> 07:23.944
There's an opening
in Northeast Division.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.613
I'd like to recommend you
for it.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.247
It'd be on an interim basis

07:27.280 --> 07:29.683
while we backfill
the usual procedures.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.252
-That fast?
-We're shorthanded.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.755
Recruitment is down
and retirement is up.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.425
The command structure's been
hollowed out in the middle.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.761
Well, that's, uh,
a lot to think about.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.664
Uh, can I have
some time with it?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.333
Yeah.
Take a few days.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.201
It's yours
if you want it, Athena.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.203
But if you don't, that's okay.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.240
Either way, at least this time,
it's your decision.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.653
All right, bud.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.121
Dad's running a little behind.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.859
(grunting):
Ah, come on.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.064
Eddito.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.832
EDDIE:
Morning, Abuela.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.701
Eddie.
Help him out.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.202
EDDIE:
He wants to do it.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.804
Hola, mi angel.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.872
Hola.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.574
Thank you for taking him.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.809
Taking him is not a problem.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.343
Giving him back--
that's the hard part.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.345
Okay.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.581
Edmundo.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.015
-Ah.
-Where's the fire?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.050
-(laughs)
-(speaks Spanish)

08:39.720 --> 08:42.055
-That's better. Now go to work.
-Okay.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.757
Okay. Mwah.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.694
-Later, buddy.
-(speaking Spanish)

08:52.132 --> 08:53.634
WOMAN: Who like mimosas?!

08:55.603 --> 08:57.871
Hi, 911.
This is Tanya.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.272
Hi, Tanya, this is Maddie,

08:59.306 --> 09:01.609
and this line is reserved
for emergencies.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.411
(laughing):
No, I totally have an emergency.

09:04.444 --> 09:07.414
I'm sorry.
My friend is just laughing,

09:07.447 --> 09:09.382
and it's making me laugh, and...

09:09.416 --> 09:11.619
Okay, I'm fine now, for real.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.688
So, anyway, we're
at Saddle Ranch on Sunset,

09:14.722 --> 09:16.957
and my friend just
got her head stuck in a pipe.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.792
What kind of pipe?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.394
-It's, like, metal, I think.
-Is it a drainpipe, or a sewer?

09:21.428 --> 09:23.063
TANYA:
A sewer?

09:23.096 --> 09:25.866
God, no. It's attached
to this guy's truck.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.201
You mean a tailpipe?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.470
Yeah! That.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.472
(siren wailing, horn honking)

09:32.505 --> 09:35.442
* On a lightning raid

09:35.475 --> 09:37.044
* Just like a river runs

09:37.077 --> 09:39.046
Grab a creeper and some blocks.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.480
She's over here.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.050
* Like a fire needs flame, oh

09:43.083 --> 09:45.552
Holy crap, you are hot.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.487
-(people cheering)
-* I gotta feel it

09:47.520 --> 09:49.322
* In my blood...

09:49.356 --> 09:52.159
Okay, guys,
the strippers are here.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.460
-BUCK:
Excuse me, coming through.
-BOBBY: All right, ladies,

09:53.493 --> 09:56.229
just give us some space.
Thank you.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.299
Excuse me, clear a path.
Coming through, thank you,

09:59.332 --> 10:01.168
thank you... thank you.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.306
CHIMNEY:
Hi, what's her name?

10:06.339 --> 10:08.776
-Betty.
-(muffled): Jennifer.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.844
Sorry, I thought
you meant my truck.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.747
-This is your truck?
-Yeah, but it's not like
I backed into her.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.415
She did this
out of her own free will.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.517
-You dared her to.
-We were flirting.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.152
Your idea of flirting
with a girl is daring her

10:19.186 --> 10:20.688
to stick her head
in your tailpipe?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.322
Oh, man.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.857
CHIMNEY:
Hi, Jennifer. LAFD.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.993
-How you feeling?
-Uh, pretty good, actually.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.995
Except for this whole, you know,

10:28.028 --> 10:30.363
ginormous tailpipe on my head.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.299
HEN:
Hey, Jennifer, you're gonna
feel me poking around.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.467
-We're just
checking you out, okay?
-All right.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.369
-Why is this tailpipe so large?
-BRENT: It's custom.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.271
Where'd she get
these bruises on her arm?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.107
-That wasn't me.
-It's from the bull.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.709
She rode it, like, five times.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.143
There's no way we're gonna
get a collar on her.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.478
-I got it.
-Get me out of this thing.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.614
These things are meant
to increase

10:47.647 --> 10:49.883
-the power to the engine.
-Yup.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.484
TSA 230 saw
should do the job.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.286
Oh, yeah, like a knife
through butter.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.056
-Chim?
-Excuse me.
Way ahead of you, Cap.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.725
BRENT:
What?!

10:57.758 --> 11:00.127
No, I spent 1,200 bucks
on that tailpipe.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.530
You might want to close
your eyes during this part.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.998
Just type your number
in my phone,

11:05.032 --> 11:06.967
and I'll text you
so you have mine.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.836
BUCK:
Thanks, but I actually
have a girlfriend,

11:08.869 --> 11:11.004
and I need to focus right now
so my captain doesn't

11:11.038 --> 11:14.174
-cut your friend's head off.
-Hi. Do you have Snapchat?

11:14.207 --> 11:16.043
No. And, uh, I don't think
I'm what you're looking for.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.879
-I have... I have a son.
-That's great. So do I.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.013
JENNIFER:
I think I'm gonna puke.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.214
You better not.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.416
These fire guys
are totally hot.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.418
All right, what say
we move the peanut gallery

11:25.452 --> 11:26.754
a few steps over this way.
Thank you.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.088
Everybody back a little bit,

11:28.121 --> 11:29.422
-thank you.
-HEN: All right, Jennifer,

11:29.456 --> 11:31.558
keep your head completely still.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.927
You're gonna hear a lot of
noise, but everything is fine.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.832
(saw whirring, grinding)

11:38.866 --> 11:41.969
JENNIFER:
(squeals) What are you doing?!

11:45.138 --> 11:46.606
BOBBY:
All right, almost there.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.512
HEN:
Okay.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.614
Easy.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.551
-BUCK: We need lube.
-I have some.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.822
Clutch.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.593
EDDIE:
Slowly. Slowly.

12:06.626 --> 12:09.129
(applause)

12:10.430 --> 12:12.800
Wow, you really are hot.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.567
Would you like us to
transport you to the hospital,

12:14.601 --> 12:15.602
get checked out?

12:15.635 --> 12:16.970
She just needs another drink.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.571
No, what she needs to do
is go home.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.107
All three of you do,
in a cab.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.375
Listen to me.
When you sober up,

12:22.409 --> 12:24.211
you feel like you have
a headache or blurry vision,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.979
or you feel confused, you got to
get yourself to a hospital,

12:26.013 --> 12:27.881
you understand?

12:27.915 --> 12:29.082
(giggling)

12:30.317 --> 12:32.152
HEN:
Condolences on Betty.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.655
-DARLENE: Are you okay?
-JENNIFER: Actually, yeah.

12:35.688 --> 12:39.159
Hey, so is your son really
the reason you don't date?

12:39.192 --> 12:42.329
That, and...
they weren't my type.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.165
Not mine either.
Not anymore.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.434
But I'm talking in general.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.936
It's complicated
when you have a kid.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.338
Come on, that's a weak excuse.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.774
You live in your
invisible girlfriend's house,

12:54.808 --> 12:57.610
and you're telling me
about weak excuses.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.847
-(mutters)
-(phone vibrating)

13:03.316 --> 13:05.318
Hello?

13:07.187 --> 13:09.356
What?

13:09.389 --> 13:11.691
Which one?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.497
(indistinct announcement
on P.A.)

13:20.400 --> 13:21.701
My aunt.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.106
Tía. ¿Qué pasó?
Is Christopher okay?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.175
(sighs)
Yes.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.944
You mean Prince Charming, hmm?
He's peachy.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.379
(woman laughing)

13:32.412 --> 13:34.781
It's your abuela.
She broke her hip.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.349
What? How?

13:36.383 --> 13:37.985
She was out back on the steps

13:38.018 --> 13:39.953
and calling him to come inside.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.554
She lost her balance.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.124
Christopher called 911.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.893
The rescue got there
really quick.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.661
-I want to see her.
-No, she's sleeping now.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.731
And, uh, who is this?

13:51.764 --> 13:53.800
This is Buck.
We work together.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.536
Mm. I thought you just
dressed alike.

13:56.569 --> 14:00.140
-This is my Aunt Josefina. Pepa.
-Hi.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.410
You can't keep
doing this, Eddie.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.045
You cannot keep
leaving him with her.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.713
She's not up to it.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.848
I know.
I know, and I'm sorry.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.484
I... I'm trying to find some
permanent help, it's just...

14:11.518 --> 14:13.921
too many forms to fill out.
It's worse than the V.A.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.656
I can't believe your gringa ex
stuck you with all of this.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.259
I'm not stuck, Tia.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.994
Do you have to go back to work?

14:21.028 --> 14:24.331
Ah. And you're not stuck.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.698
I'll keep him tonight,

14:25.732 --> 14:28.768
but you need to
get this figured out.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.870
Daddy.
(laughs)

14:32.805 --> 14:34.441
Buddy.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.176
Hey...

14:36.209 --> 14:37.877
-(grunts)
-(laughs)

14:37.911 --> 14:39.079
BUCK:
Must be rough.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.614
Raising any child alone
is rough.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.317
My nephew is a saint.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.620
But I pray for him anyway.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.132
(door opens)

14:59.166 --> 15:00.934
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.103
You guys have fun at your dad's?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.705
-Yeah.
-It was fun.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.374
We got you these
on the way back.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.608
Oh!

15:08.641 --> 15:11.478
Thanks, baby.
(laughs)

15:11.511 --> 15:13.080
Uh, but what's the occasion?

15:13.113 --> 15:14.314
For your promotion.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.649
Congratulations.
It's about time.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.219
Yes, it is.
And we are so proud of you.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.921
Thanks, but I haven't
taken the job.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.390
I'm still thinking about it.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.992
What is there to think about?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.759
You've been wanting
this forever.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.129
Why don't you guys go
and put your stuff away.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.331
Okay.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.803
Okay, I don't get it.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.172
I thought that you would be
more excited about this.

15:39.206 --> 15:42.475
Hell, I thought that
you would be celebrating.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.977
All these years--

15:44.011 --> 15:47.747
the long hours, extra shifts.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.250
You fighting to get recognized.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.819
Athena, you work so hard,
why are you not

15:52.852 --> 15:54.454
enjoying this moment?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.589
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just too tired.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.791
All that fighting
takes its toll.

15:58.825 --> 16:03.296
When I joined the force,
I was young and ambitious.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.832
Enthusiastic.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.605
It's just...
(sighs)

16:12.639 --> 16:15.308
I keep thinking
of the twentysomething me.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.777
Her dreams, her goals.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.946
She had a vision
of what success looked like.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.216
It was all about stars and bars,
climbing up the ladder,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.852
blowing through
that glass ceiling.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.820
I don't need that anymore.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.790
Success is now about...

16:30.823 --> 16:32.992
those kids, this family.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.163
People in my life
who love me.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.565
People out there
who count on me.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.902
I am finally in a place
where I'm comfortable

16:42.935 --> 16:45.672
in my life and in my own skin.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.576
I don't know if I want
to upend that for a pay bump.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.378
Oh. Oh, this...

16:51.411 --> 16:53.680
this is not about a paycheck.

16:53.713 --> 16:57.016
It's the recognition
for all of your hard work.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.586
Yeah, yeah, you're in
a comfortable spot.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.155
That doesn't mean that you
should get stuck there forever.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.724
Take a risk.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.729
The next place might be better.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.336
-I do this too much?
-We all agree,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.571
-believe me.
-(laughter)

17:18.605 --> 17:20.240
Christopher,
I thought we were buddies--

17:20.273 --> 17:21.941
-what happened?
-What's this?

17:21.974 --> 17:24.511
I don't remember asking
the chief for reinforcements.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.878
You any good with a hose, kid?

17:25.912 --> 17:27.247
-I can try.
-All right.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.116
So sorry, Cap.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.883
My aunt's trying
to get off work early,

17:30.917 --> 17:33.586
but until then, I...
I didn't know where to take him.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.022
Yeah, you did.
Right here. Buck gave me

17:36.055 --> 17:37.924
a heads-up. I already
cleared it with the chief.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.092
-(alarm ringing)
-MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, station...

17:39.126 --> 17:41.228
All right, let's go, let's go!

17:41.261 --> 17:43.062
-All right, buddy.
-Okay.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.232
PD is on the scene
with a possible entrapment.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.066
(laughing)

17:49.636 --> 17:52.939
These are great, see, 'cause
we can talk to each other.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.808
Though sometimes I wish I had
a mute button for Buck.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.577
(truck horn honks)

17:57.610 --> 17:59.546
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you saying something?

17:59.579 --> 18:02.149
* Something ain't right,
I'm so scared... *

18:02.182 --> 18:05.752
-You have a scar on your head.
-That's very observant, kid.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.620
I had an accident.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.389
Got a big metal rod
stuck in my head,

18:09.422 --> 18:11.491
but the doctor took care of it.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.992
You ever have surgery?

18:13.025 --> 18:14.060
Two times.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.929
Actually, three times.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.266
Well, you got me beat.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.767
Now I feel kind of lame.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.801
Because you are.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.003
(laughing)

18:24.036 --> 18:26.806
Your dad ever tell you
why we call him Chimney?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.508
No.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.311
No. No, no, no, no.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.414
I'll tell you the story later.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.283
-(car alarm blaring)
-* Clowns to the left of me,
jokers to the right... *

18:36.316 --> 18:38.017
Hey, can you grab the Jaws?

18:38.050 --> 18:40.019
Now, you see, her air bags went
off, so that protected her.

18:40.052 --> 18:43.523
She's gonna be fine.
You know what happens sometimes?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.425
-CHRISTOPHER: People get stuck.
-BOBBY: That's right,
people get stuck.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.927
But we have a tool
called the Jaws of Life.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.962
And that's what your dad's
gonna use right now.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.499
Thanks to him, she's gonna
make it home for dinner.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.667
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.471
* Please...

18:58.505 --> 19:01.107
All right, Christopher,
come on over here. Ready?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.376
Nice.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.179
Christopher, here we go.
Here we go.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.315
Good job. Look at that.
You're doing it.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.817
Did you get a bonus already?
Look at how good you are.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.319
You're a natural.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.354
* And I can see it makes
no sense at all *

19:14.387 --> 19:15.988
(growls)

19:16.022 --> 19:19.726
* Is it cool to go to sleep
on the floor... *

19:19.759 --> 19:21.628
What do you think?
Is it good?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.630
Yeah.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.165
-EDDIE: Come down, bud.
-One more firefighter.
Look at that! Yay!

19:26.199 --> 19:28.635
(all cheering)

19:28.668 --> 19:31.304
-Whoa.
-CHIMNEY: Good job.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.574
You nailed it, kid.
(laughs)

19:36.709 --> 19:40.146
-All right, fun's over.
-Aw...

19:40.179 --> 19:41.314
-Bye, Christopher.
-Later, Christopher.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.915
-Bye, Christopher.
-Bye.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.384
-HEN: See you next time.
-CHRISTOPHER: Bye.
-EDDIE: Come on, bud.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.586
Good job today, kiddo.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.155
-You, too, Cap.
-(chuckling)

19:49.188 --> 19:52.825
Hola, mi amor.
Okay, vamanos.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.494
See you later.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.828
PEPA:
Okay. Did you have fun?

19:55.862 --> 19:57.096
Be careful there, baby.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.437
Thanks, Cap.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.443
I just feel bad for him,
you know?

20:10.477 --> 20:11.744
Eddie, I mean.
Not Christopher.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.281
Christopher's great.
He's smart, adorable,

20:14.314 --> 20:15.882
funny, in a kid way.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.350
He just needs a little
extra help.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.419
-Cerebral palsy, right?
-Aunt Pepa said

20:19.452 --> 20:21.087
he got stuck in the birth canal.
There were some

20:21.120 --> 20:22.922
-complications, and then...
-Well, did Aunt Pepa

20:22.955 --> 20:25.124
explain what's happening
with the child care situation?

20:25.157 --> 20:26.759
Because there are programs.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.296
Eddie's working on it.
He's got insurance.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.864
And there's other stuff through
the city, state and county,

20:31.898 --> 20:33.800
but the requirements
are all different.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.636
You can apply for one, and it
can disqualify you from another.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.105
It's a whole, giant
bureaucratic mess.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.207
-I-I can't
get my head around it.
-I was a nurse,

20:41.240 --> 20:44.076
remember? The only people
who truly navigate a bureaucracy

20:44.110 --> 20:46.212
are the people
who work inside it.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.114
It shouldn't be that way,
though-- Eddie, always

20:48.147 --> 20:50.450
wondering how to take care
of Christopher, and Christopher

20:50.483 --> 20:52.385
feeling like a burden
on his dad.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.454
Eddie doesn't feel
that way, does he?

20:54.487 --> 20:56.923
Not even a little.

20:56.956 --> 21:00.159
He, uh, loves that kid
like crazy.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.328
He's a really great dad.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.563
So, does this boy crush
on Eddie

21:03.596 --> 21:05.398
mean that you're
finally ready to, uh,

21:05.432 --> 21:07.099
move on from Abby?

21:07.133 --> 21:09.402
That's cute.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.171
I have some news.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.608
I found an apartment.
It's not far from work.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.577
Two bedrooms, secure building.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.013
-Parking included.
-So you're really moving out?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.249
I told you that I wasn't gonna
be able to live here forever.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.652
Look, when I left Doug,

21:25.685 --> 21:27.320
I didn't have a plan.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.921
I just grabbed up all my stuff

21:28.955 --> 21:31.491
and ran as fast and as far
as I possibly could,

21:31.524 --> 21:35.362
but then you convinced me
to start over,

21:35.395 --> 21:36.929
make a brand new life in L.A.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.665
I was right about that.

21:38.698 --> 21:41.000
You were.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.002
But it's just
not gonna feel like mine

21:43.035 --> 21:45.872
unless I'm standing
on my own two feet.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.375
That's the only way
I'm gonna know it's real.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.620
MRI TECH:
You ready, Mr. Han?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.455
No matter how many times
I do this,

22:02.489 --> 22:04.056
I hate being stuck
in this thing.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.325
Yeah.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.895
Try not to move your head.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.132
It's extraordinary--

22:13.165 --> 22:14.901
to think that
just ten months ago

22:14.934 --> 22:16.869
you had that stuck
through your skull.

22:16.903 --> 22:20.573
As always, your bedside manner
totally sucks, doc.

22:20.607 --> 22:23.410
(laughs)
I-I apologize, it's...

22:23.443 --> 22:25.177
34 years in neurology,

22:25.211 --> 22:27.580
I have never seen
anything like it.

22:27.614 --> 22:30.216
-You're a modern
medical miracle.
-Yeah?

22:30.249 --> 22:33.486
Uh, to be honest, I still
don't remember much of it.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.388
Well, as we've discussed,

22:35.422 --> 22:37.223
some amnesia around
such a traumatic event--

22:37.256 --> 22:39.191
it's to be expected.

22:40.427 --> 22:43.229
Did we discuss that?

22:43.262 --> 22:44.897
I'm just joking.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.265
All right, so how we looking?

22:46.298 --> 22:47.834
Excellent.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.270
As you can see, no sign
of traumatic brain injury.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.240
You're exactly where you were
two months ago.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.975
Fantastic.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.591
Tatiana?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.994
Hi, Chimney.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.898
You doing the math in your head?

23:18.931 --> 23:21.400
No.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.269
Uh, yes.

23:23.302 --> 23:26.739
Don't worry, unless this is
the longest-incubated baby

23:26.773 --> 23:28.941
in human history,
she's my husband's.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.143
Oh.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.045
So, you're married, too?

23:33.079 --> 23:35.081
Yeah.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.283
I'm glad that I ran into you.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.786
I've been wanting to call,
but what do you say?

23:39.819 --> 23:43.122
"Sorry that I was so awful
and broke up with you

23:43.155 --> 23:45.725
"without even calling when you
were laid up in the hospital

23:45.758 --> 23:47.159
with a metal pipe in your head?"

23:47.193 --> 23:50.329
Yes, those words exactly,
actually.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.231
Except it was rebar,
not a pipe.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.334
Everything else okay,
I mean, like, on the inside?

23:55.367 --> 23:59.271
Yeah, just got another
clean bill of health.

23:59.305 --> 24:00.673
I'm a miracle.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.409
In more ways than one.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.277
That whole experience
woke me up,

24:05.311 --> 24:07.847
not just to how fragile life is,

24:07.880 --> 24:10.116
but to the kind of person
that I was.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.318
So I went to that
clinic up north

24:12.351 --> 24:15.121
where you spend ten days
looking at your life,

24:15.154 --> 24:18.491
tearing apart your personality,
and figuring it all out.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.459
I'm very happy for you.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.661
No, you're not.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.230
Which is fair.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.869
How's your life?
I mean, anyone special?

24:29.902 --> 24:33.606
Uh... not at the moment, no.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.875
But I did a
firefighter calendar.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.178
-I'm Mr. April.
-Oh.

24:39.211 --> 24:42.982
That's great.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.487
-Send me one if you want.
-(elevator bell dings)

24:57.429 --> 24:59.431
I'll wait for the next one.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.426
MORRIS (muffled):
Help! Help!

25:29.028 --> 25:31.330
-It's hot in here!
-I do not give my consent

25:31.363 --> 25:34.200
to use my face
on whatever show this is.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.056
Okay, ma'am, it sounds like
you should be calling your bank.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.524
WOMAN:
It told me to call 911.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.959
I'm sorry?

25:59.992 --> 26:01.193
A note came out of the thingy.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.394
It says someone's stuck inside.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.296
I know it sounds crazy,

26:04.330 --> 26:07.066
but I think I can hear someone
yelling from in there.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.603
Inside the machine?
Are you sure?

26:10.637 --> 26:12.004
I'm sure I don't have my money.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.444
BUCK:
The only way she knows
it's real is for her

26:18.477 --> 26:19.779
to live in a two-bedroom
apartment in Eagle Rock.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.147
What does that even mean?

26:21.180 --> 26:22.615
I think it means
she's not comfortable

26:22.649 --> 26:23.750
squatting in some
stranger's condo.

26:23.783 --> 26:24.917
Abby's not a stranger.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.653
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:26.686 --> 26:29.088
HEN:
So she has a new life.
Great. So do you.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.890
No, that's the point.
I don't have a new life.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.324
I have the same life.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.560
You should be grateful.
You almost died, Chim.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.495
Exactly: I almost died
and I didn't.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.731
I had a life-altering trauma,
and her life got altered.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.066
All I got was the trauma.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.601
Welded hinges.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.071
-Yup.
-Bank said they sent
a technician out this morning

26:45.104 --> 26:46.739
to replace the lock
on the vault.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.775
Found his van in the lot.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.276
Cell phone was
in the passenger seat.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.511
Best guess is he got locked
inside the vault

26:52.544 --> 26:53.780
with no way to call out.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.649
-Help!
-BUCK: Sir, we're gonna

26:56.683 --> 26:58.751
-get you out of there.
-Help! Can you hear me?!

26:58.785 --> 27:00.787
Oh. There he is.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.488
HEN:
Did you expect her to wait?

27:02.521 --> 27:04.657
How about at least
until I came out of my coma?

27:04.691 --> 27:06.092
And by the looks of her belly,

27:06.125 --> 27:07.526
I'm pretty sure
she was getting busy

27:07.559 --> 27:09.195
while that rebar
was still in my head.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.463
I just feel like it's all
happening too fast.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.499
I mean, how many years
did it take her

27:13.532 --> 27:15.768
before she was ready
to leave Doug?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.369
That hardly feels
like the same thing.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.772
My point is she just got here

27:19.806 --> 27:22.675
and now she's leaving again.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.712
Buck, she's moving
to Eagle Rock, not Alaska.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.380
It's ten minutes from
your place. Abby's place.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.382
Your sister's building
a new life for herself.

27:30.416 --> 27:31.684
Be proud of her.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.552
I should be happy
for her, right?

27:33.585 --> 27:35.387
She did apologize,
not just for how it ended,

27:35.421 --> 27:37.023
but before, too.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.325
She said she felt like
maybe she had been a bitch.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.360
She's not lying.
She was a bitch.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.129
What? You're my friend.
She's your ex.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.563
You get to forgive and move on.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.032
I get to hold a grudge
until I die.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.571
You think it's weird
I still live in Abby's place?

27:52.604 --> 27:54.573
Yes.

27:54.606 --> 27:57.643
Me, too.
Don't tell anyone.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.746
It was fine at first, you know?
She was just gonna be gone

27:59.779 --> 28:02.081
for a few months
and I wanted to be supportive,

28:02.114 --> 28:05.017
but she still hasn't come back
and I don't know what to do.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.252
I'm just...

28:06.285 --> 28:08.520
Stuck.
That's how I feel.

28:08.554 --> 28:09.856
I almost died and my life
is exactly the same

28:09.889 --> 28:11.523
as it was before.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.860
It's not like I woke up
out of a coma and, suddenly,

28:13.893 --> 28:16.929
I know how to play the piano
or speak a foreign language.

28:16.963 --> 28:19.531
Chimney, I think you're setting
your expectations too high.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.868
No, I think
I'm setting them too low.

28:21.901 --> 28:25.404
We hardly ever even talk,
you know?

28:25.437 --> 28:28.374
It's always time zone issues
or cell phone problems.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.843
-Did you know she's been
in Morocco over a week?
-(Morris shouting inside)

28:30.877 --> 28:32.845
-No, I did not know that.
-No, me neither.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.081
Found out yesterday
on Instagram.

28:35.114 --> 28:38.284
(grunts)
I still love Abby,

28:38.317 --> 28:40.186
and I want her to be happy.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.687
How long do I have to wait

28:41.720 --> 28:43.689
before I get to be happy, too?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.924
(grunts):
Got it.

28:44.957 --> 28:48.194
All right, we got it.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.962
Step back. Ready?

28:53.332 --> 28:55.902
I don't know this Abby person,

28:55.935 --> 28:59.138
but I've never been happier
to see anyone in my life.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.316
You like the classics,
don't you?

29:10.349 --> 29:12.151
I'm sorry?

29:12.184 --> 29:15.387
Your eye is drawn to the more
traditional, classic setting.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.789
This one here.

29:16.823 --> 29:19.291
It's our most popular
engagement ring,

29:19.325 --> 29:22.261
and with good reason.
Would you like to see it?

29:22.294 --> 29:24.163
No. (stammers)
No, no thank you.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.266
But, uh, you could show me
the box it comes in.

29:27.299 --> 29:29.735
Excuse me?
You-you want to see the box?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.804
Yeah, uh, I already, uh...
(chuckles)

29:31.838 --> 29:33.272
I already have the-the ring.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.108
I'm not crazy, I-I-I promise.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.945
My girlfriend-- my soon to be
fiancé... (chuckles)

29:38.978 --> 29:40.913
I hope-- a few months
after we met,

29:40.947 --> 29:42.481
I-I bought her an expensive
diamond necklace

29:42.514 --> 29:44.016
-from this very store.
-Oh, nice.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.017
Yeah.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.919
And she pawned it.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.021
Then donated the money
to an animal shelter.

29:49.055 --> 29:51.423
Isn't that... sweet.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.659
So, I-I kind of just-just want
the box, if-if that's okay?

29:53.692 --> 29:55.127
Sure.

29:55.161 --> 29:58.865
Seriously?
You still haven't left yet?

29:58.898 --> 30:00.632
Daniel, I have to be back
at work in an hour.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.734
DANIEL:
Ariel, turn around.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.038
-Ariel Simone...
-(Ariel gasps)

30:06.072 --> 30:08.174
I love you to the moon and back.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.808
Will you marry me?

30:09.842 --> 30:11.343
(laughing):
Yes! Of course I'll...

30:12.344 --> 30:13.980
-Daniel!
-(screaming)

30:29.728 --> 30:31.063
BOBBY:
LAFD, coming through.

30:33.232 --> 30:36.068
Hey, I guess they'd been working
on the escalator overnight.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.836
The floor panel on the landing--

30:37.870 --> 30:39.638
it must not have been
put back securely.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.739
Daniel, help is here.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.342
The fire department is here.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.144
Please tell me he's gonna be
okay. Please help him.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.913
We're gonna do everything
we can, okay? We're...

30:46.946 --> 30:49.148
They're gonna it over
from here. What's his name?

30:49.181 --> 30:51.483
-It's Daniel.
-Hey, Daniel, can you hear me?

30:51.517 --> 30:52.919
We got to get this step
out of here.

30:52.952 --> 30:56.155
BUCK:
One, two, three.

30:56.188 --> 31:00.059
BOBBY:
All right, Chim, you're on.

31:00.092 --> 31:03.095
* Ask me no questions,
I will tell you no lies *

31:03.129 --> 31:04.330
I got a pulse, guys.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.664
Oh, thank God!

31:05.697 --> 31:07.533
Daniel, can you hear me?

31:07.566 --> 31:09.368
Ariel... No, I need
to see her for... Aah!

31:09.401 --> 31:10.937
-Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on, buddy.
-(moaning)

31:10.970 --> 31:13.239
I need you to stay
very still, okay?

31:13.272 --> 31:14.840
But I want you
to keep talking to me.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.243
I was, uh...

31:17.276 --> 31:20.579
-proposing to-to my girl.
-All right,

31:20.612 --> 31:23.282
-talk to me, Chim.
What do you got?
-It's not good.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.884
-What's happening?
Why are you stopping?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.287
The chain is sitting on top
of his femoral artery.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.555
It's possible
it's even nicked it.

31:29.588 --> 31:30.957
Loosening might make it worse.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.358
Tension's acting
as a tourniquet,

31:32.391 --> 31:34.060
could be keeping him
from bleeding out.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.694
All right, let's get him
out of there. Chim, tie him off.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.796
-Hen, get an I.V.,
run it wide open.
-Copy that.

31:37.829 --> 31:41.267
-* But if love is enough
-(grunting)

31:41.300 --> 31:42.434
* Could you let it show

31:42.468 --> 31:43.936
* Let it show *

31:43.970 --> 31:45.437
* If you feel it, could you...

31:45.471 --> 31:47.473
Clipping the wires and chain.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.442
(chain snaps)

31:52.078 --> 31:53.479
-Aah! (moaning)
-CHIMNEY: I know it hurts,

31:53.512 --> 31:55.447
-just relax, let me
get you out of here.
-Daniel!

31:55.481 --> 31:56.949
Okay, try to relax,
try to breathe.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.384
We're gonna get you out of here.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.987
DANIEL:
Oh, God! Aah!

32:01.020 --> 32:02.888
-(screams)
-Try to relax, try to relax.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.157
I'm gonna get you out of here,
all right? I know it hurts,

32:05.191 --> 32:06.925
just relax. We're gonna
get you out of here.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.760
(Daniel moaning)

32:10.162 --> 32:12.431
CHIMNEY:
Okay, on three.

32:13.632 --> 32:14.900
One,

32:14.933 --> 32:17.469
-two... three!
-(screams)

32:17.503 --> 32:19.605
See? He's coming out,
he's coming out. It's all right.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.108
I'm gonna help, okay?

32:22.141 --> 32:23.342
Here, I got him, I got him.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.944
* But if love

32:25.978 --> 32:28.447
* Is enough
could you let it show *

32:28.480 --> 32:30.449
* Let it show *

32:30.482 --> 32:33.019
-(applause)
-* If you feel it,
could you let me know *

32:35.387 --> 32:37.823
What did she say?

32:37.856 --> 32:40.659
* If you feel it,
could you let me know? *

32:40.692 --> 32:42.694
I think she said yes, buddy.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.765
(coughs)

32:46.798 --> 32:49.268
* For a miracle.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.037
-Blood pressure's dropping.
-Breathing is shallow.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.272
-Daniel, can you hear me?
-I can't find a pulse.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.207
He's in cardiac arrest. One...

32:55.241 --> 32:57.343
Daniel?
Oh, please, God.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.978
Ma'am, you have to stand back.
Let them do their job, okay?

33:02.914 --> 33:05.017
(monitor slowly beeping)

33:10.922 --> 33:12.824
(flatline)

33:16.695 --> 33:18.897
Chim.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.204
He's gone.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.741
*

33:41.087 --> 33:43.489
(crying)

33:43.522 --> 33:46.058
Daniel...

33:46.092 --> 33:48.094
(sobbing)

34:08.914 --> 34:10.916
*

34:31.270 --> 34:33.272
You all right?

34:36.108 --> 34:39.044
No, I don't know, uh, that I am.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.079
(sighs)
I lived, Cap.

34:41.113 --> 34:43.982
(sniffles)
I'm alive.

34:44.015 --> 34:46.452
Yeah, you are.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.822
Why?

34:50.856 --> 34:53.125
How come I survived and that
poor guy back there didn't?

34:53.159 --> 34:55.927
I mean...

34:55.961 --> 34:58.096
his life was about
to change, right?

34:58.130 --> 35:00.766
He had so much to live for.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.734
So do you.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.770
Do I?

35:07.473 --> 35:10.309
Something happened to me
that was supposed to be

35:10.342 --> 35:12.644
life-changing,
and nothing changed.

35:12.678 --> 35:16.482
It's like everything
just stopped.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.819
I feel like I died that night.

35:20.852 --> 35:24.456
I mean, I just keep replaying
everything in my head,

35:24.490 --> 35:27.493
all those moments
on the freeway--

35:27.526 --> 35:28.994
the look on your face,

35:29.027 --> 35:30.696
being wheeled into the ER...

35:30.729 --> 35:32.664
I thought you didn't
remember any of that.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.436
I remember it all.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.804
(sniffles)

35:38.837 --> 35:40.639
Everything.

35:40.672 --> 35:44.109
Wakes me up in the middle
of the night. I just can't...

35:44.142 --> 35:46.512
You kept telling everybody
that you had no memory of it.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.113
I know.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.481
Why?

35:49.515 --> 35:52.884
I don't know, I just...

35:52.918 --> 35:54.886
I guess it's easier
to not talk about it,

35:54.920 --> 35:56.955
but it's always there
on my mind,

35:56.988 --> 35:58.724
I just...
I don't want to recount it

35:58.757 --> 36:01.493
as some sort of freak show
form of en... entertainment.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.529
I just want it
to go away, it's...

36:05.764 --> 36:08.234
You know, Chim...

36:11.770 --> 36:13.872
...a life-changing event
can't change your life

36:13.905 --> 36:15.441
if you keep pretending
it didn't happen.

36:17.108 --> 36:19.245
You got to talk about it, man,
you got to let it out,

36:19.278 --> 36:22.147
process it.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.582
You feel like
you're still trapped

36:23.615 --> 36:25.851
in that car, don't you?

36:25.884 --> 36:28.153
Sitting helpless
on that freeway.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.555
Well, you're not
on that freeway,

36:29.588 --> 36:30.756
and you're not helpless, Chim.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.491
You're right here, pal.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.560
So are all the people
who love you.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.196
All right.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.765
Come here.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.300
(sniffles)

36:51.643 --> 36:54.246
Thought you said we were
helping your sister move.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.014
Doesn't look like
she's packed anything.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.849
Oh, this stuff is Abby's.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.386
I lied about the whole
moving thing.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.120
I mean, my sister is moving,
it's just...

37:02.153 --> 37:04.290
she doesn't really have
that much stuff.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.558
-What's going on, Buck?
-I asked you here

37:06.592 --> 37:08.327
'cause there's
someone I want you to meet.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.397
You didn't set me up, did you?

37:11.430 --> 37:12.898
No, just-just trust me.

37:12.931 --> 37:16.101
This woman is...
exactly what you need.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.636
(knocking)

37:17.669 --> 37:19.671
She's here.

37:24.142 --> 37:25.311
Buckaroo!

37:25.344 --> 37:27.313
-(laughs)
-Carla. (chuckles)

37:27.346 --> 37:30.148
Baby... Ah! Goodness,
I missed your face.

37:30.181 --> 37:32.284
BUCK (laughs):
Oh, I missed you, too.
Come on in.

37:32.318 --> 37:35.987
Uh, Eddie, this-this
is my friend Carla.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.956
-Nice to meet you, Eddie.
-Likewise.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.659
Carla is L.A.'s finest
home health care aid.

37:40.692 --> 37:44.596
She has years of experience
navigating giant bureaucracies,

37:44.630 --> 37:46.598
and I thought she could
help you figure out

37:46.632 --> 37:48.800
how to get Christopher
what he needs.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.436
I'm red tape's worst nightmare.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.838
(laughs) I'll get you
through this in no time.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.240
Now, let's go sit down and let's
see what you're working with.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.709
Besides that perfect
bone structure.

38:01.547 --> 38:04.883
Hi. I'm actually
looking for somebody.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.689
Hi.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.425
Seeing you the other day
really threw me.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.461
I spent months

38:15.494 --> 38:18.697
thinking about
what I wanted to say to you.

38:18.730 --> 38:22.267
And then
you were there, and...

38:22.300 --> 38:23.769
and my mind just went blank.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.771
I just... I didn't know
what to say, so...

38:25.804 --> 38:28.440
I get it.
That's why I'm here.

38:28.474 --> 38:32.310
So, whatever you need to say,
I'm-I'm ready to hear it.

38:36.415 --> 38:38.384
Thank you.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.519
I-I'm glad

38:40.552 --> 38:42.220
that you didn't pretend with me
after my accident.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.090
It's not what either us needed.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.796
You see, all I did
was pretend with you

38:50.829 --> 38:53.832
the entire time
we were together, just...

38:53.865 --> 38:57.302
pretending to be something
that I wasn't.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.171
Uh, telling you stories
of things that I had never done,

39:00.205 --> 39:02.007
adventures that I'd never had.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.075
Why?

39:04.109 --> 39:08.013
I guess I always thought that
being just me wasn't enough.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.515
(chuckles)

39:09.548 --> 39:11.517
It's enough.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.419
It's more than enough.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.689
Thanks.
(chuckles)

39:20.892 --> 39:23.228
Here.

39:23.261 --> 39:27.433
(mouths)

39:27.466 --> 39:30.001
(chuckles)
It's for the baby.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.838
I figured.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.173
That's cute.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.609
And this...

39:37.643 --> 39:39.377
is for you.

39:39.411 --> 39:41.580
(laughs):
Wow.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.615
Very nice.

39:47.285 --> 39:50.188
I really want you to have
a blessed life, Tatiana.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.524
I want the same for you.

39:52.558 --> 39:55.260
Well, I guess I'll just
have to do that, then, huh?

40:23.489 --> 40:25.457
What's going on?

40:25.491 --> 40:27.092
I can hear you thinking.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.927
This about the promotion?

40:28.960 --> 40:32.263
I have to give Maynard my
decision before my shift starts.

40:32.297 --> 40:33.565
You're worried
she's gonna think less of you

40:33.599 --> 40:35.300
when you turn it down?

40:35.333 --> 40:38.403
How did you know
I'm turning it down?

40:38.436 --> 40:42.007
Everyone else I've told assumes,
of course, I'm taking it.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.442
I'd be crazy not to.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.913
I don't think it's crazy
to be happy with what you have.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.516
To feel satisfied it's enough.

40:50.549 --> 40:53.051
Is it enough?

40:56.354 --> 40:58.289
I like being out there,

40:58.323 --> 41:01.627
seeing with my own eyes what's
really going on in the world,

41:01.660 --> 41:03.962
doing my job,

41:03.995 --> 41:05.964
helping where I can.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.366
then coming home
at the end of the day

41:08.399 --> 41:10.969
and letting it all go.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.838
Know what I mean?

41:12.871 --> 41:14.372
Hey, I became a firefighter
'cause I didn't want

41:14.405 --> 41:17.509
to be behind a desk.

41:17.543 --> 41:19.945
In the truck, with my team--

41:19.978 --> 41:22.948
that's what I want for as long
as they'll let me have it.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.516
There's nothing wrong with that.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.151
No, there isn't.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.854
You think you can sleep now?

41:28.887 --> 41:30.789
(chuckles)

41:30.822 --> 41:34.392
Maybe not just yet.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.730
MADDIE:
We all get stuck
from time to time.

41:38.764 --> 41:40.966
In our circumstances,
in our fear,

41:40.999 --> 41:44.570
stuck on a page we haven't
yet been able to turn.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.371
So this is really
everything, huh?

41:46.404 --> 41:49.641
Yeah. Unless you want to give me
some of Abby's dishes.

41:49.675 --> 41:53.278
I'll accumulate stuff.
That's part of starting over.

41:56.214 --> 41:58.717
And when we're feeling stuck,

41:58.750 --> 42:01.553
or even just a little
too comfortable,

42:01.587 --> 42:04.823
if we're very lucky,
someone will be there...

42:04.856 --> 42:06.858
(indistinct chatter)

42:12.463 --> 42:14.332
(chuckles)

42:14.365 --> 42:16.868
(gasps)
Hola, mi amor.

42:16.902 --> 42:20.005
-All right.
-Hi. (speaks Spanish)

42:20.038 --> 42:23.709
Oh, who is that?
Who is that?

42:23.742 --> 42:25.844
MADDIE:
...to give us a little push.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.212
Or a kick in the pants.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.014
Or just offer a hand...

42:29.047 --> 42:31.049
(speaking Spanish)

42:35.721 --> 42:38.790
...to help us get unstuck.

43:23.468 --> 43:25.771
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

43:25.804 --> 43:28.039
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.810
Buckle up, buttercup.

43:34.145 --> 43:36.481
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

43:36.514 --> 43:40.085
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

43:40.118 --> 43:43.655
* We live for glory
not forever *

43:43.689 --> 43:44.690
MAN: Touchdown!

43:44.723 --> 43:48.293
* Reach out *

43:48.326 --> 43:51.930
* Make this right here
right now *

43:51.963 --> 43:54.866
* Stand up *

43:55.734 --> 43:57.502
* Here right now *

43:57.535 --> 43:59.504
That sounds like fun.
