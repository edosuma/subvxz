are around here somewhere.

01:19.420 --> 01:23.580
Whenever there's a perfect day
at my pond,

01:23.580 --> 01:25.960
they always come
and spoil it.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.790
Well they won't get
past me this time.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.540
-Nuh-uh.
-Lucky: Cannonball!

01:32.540 --> 01:34.040
Yeah!

01:35.670 --> 01:36.920
-Yipee!

01:36.920 --> 01:38.290
-Aah!
-Yeah!

01:48.920 --> 01:50.460
Beat it, you
dotted delinquents!

01:50.460 --> 01:52.920
This is my pond.

01:55.040 --> 01:59.250
Actually, Hiccup Hole is
part of mother nature's garden.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.620
It's here for us all to enjoy.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.500
Hm.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.120
-Take that!

02:22.710 --> 02:23.960
You're all wet!

02:49.040 --> 02:51.790
Guys! Guys, help me!

02:51.790 --> 02:54.330
I'm-- I'm blue!

02:54.330 --> 02:55.880
Oh, Spot.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.120
These little side trips
to Unhappy Land have to stop.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.120
She thought I meant blue.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.880
That's nice.
Ah, yeah, blue.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.120
Uh-huh.
I meant blue!

03:09.710 --> 03:14.000
Ugh. Look what
they've done to my pond.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.290
Look what they've done to me.

03:16.290 --> 03:18.670
Whoa!

03:26.290 --> 03:29.040
Yuck. Pollution.

03:29.040 --> 03:33.710
How could someone so callously
violate nature's bathtub?

03:33.710 --> 03:37.170
Yeah, looks more like
nature's toilet bowl.

03:37.170 --> 03:39.000
Yeah, there ought to be a law

03:39.000 --> 03:41.540
against dumping gunk
into an innocent stream.

03:41.540 --> 03:45.380
Besides, these toxins
can cause side effects.

03:55.420 --> 03:57.330
Spots:
We love you, Spot!

03:59.790 --> 04:02.960
There is a law.
Dumping crud's illegal,

04:02.960 --> 04:06.170
and we're not gonna rest
until we find out who did this.

04:06.170 --> 04:07.960
Let's follow the trail.

04:28.250 --> 04:31.750
Hey, let's hop on this truck
and see where it came from.

04:45.420 --> 04:47.040
Spot:
Pollution hurts.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.420
Cadpig:
Do you see anything?

05:02.670 --> 05:04.080
It's Horace and Jasper.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.000
That means only one person
could be behind this.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.750

are quite fat free ♪

05:11.750 --> 05:14.790
♪ The way you know

05:14.790 --> 05:16.920

05:18.250 --> 05:21.830
-Fabulous! Mwah!

05:21.830 --> 05:24.750
I am simply sensational
in my new commercial.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.500
Don't you agree?

05:26.500 --> 05:27.880
Of course you do.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.750
I pay you to agree.

05:29.750 --> 05:30.790
She pays you?

05:30.790 --> 05:31.960
Never you mind that!

05:31.960 --> 05:35.710
There should be another load
of our little blue problem

05:35.710 --> 05:37.420
for you to dispose of by now.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.210
Where should we take this batch?

05:39.210 --> 05:41.040
How should I know?

05:41.040 --> 05:44.540
I don't know anything
about your illegal doings.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.670
Just dump it.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.880
Well, we might as well
take it back to that stream.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.170
It's a place as good
as any to dump it.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.540
We gotta think

05:59.540 --> 06:00.880
of a way to stop 'em.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.620
We could flatten the tires.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.500
Hm, I know.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.750
We'll flatten the tires.

06:05.750 --> 06:06.920
'Kay.

06:09.710 --> 06:10.750
Spot:
Make way.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.000
Step aside.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Poultry comin' through.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.420
Ahem.

06:27.750 --> 06:31.830
I thought alien mutants
from other planets was green.

06:31.830 --> 06:33.120
Well, of course they're green.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.420
Everybody knows that.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.880
-Then how come
those are blue?

06:51.790 --> 06:53.790
Hey, you two!
Get back to work!

06:58.670 --> 07:01.750
Actually, I prefer
a relaxed fit.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.750
-This way!

07:42.000 --> 07:44.540
We failed!

07:44.540 --> 07:46.750
Hiccup Hole is doomed!

07:46.750 --> 07:49.170
Don't succumb to
that negative thought pattern!

07:49.170 --> 07:51.420
If we don't do something,
who will?

07:51.420 --> 07:53.380
But we're just puppies!

07:53.380 --> 07:55.460
Not just any puppies, Rolly.

07:55.460 --> 07:57.710
We're dalmatian puppies.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.710
And a chicken.

07:58.710 --> 08:02.120
And that gives me an idea
for a two-parter plan.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.250
Come on,
we'll head 'em off!

08:08.330 --> 08:11.330
You know, we could go faster
if we didn't have a flat tire.

08:11.330 --> 08:13.580
Thanks for the tip, Einstein.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.120
Stick your beak
through that hole.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.540
-Just do it.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.540
Now, Spot.

08:36.540 --> 08:38.830
Ugh, now we've got
two flat tires.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.380
Hm, well, they're just gonna get
the tires repaired.

08:44.380 --> 08:47.580
And then more dumping
of gunk into Hiccup Hole.

08:47.580 --> 08:51.290
Don't worry, it's time
for part two of my plan.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.670
The second part of your plan

08:52.670 --> 08:55.250
better not have anything
to do with my beak.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.500
No, Spot.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.620
Now we take matters
into our own paws.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.500
Unless we get off our tails
and do something now,

09:04.500 --> 09:06.710
Hiccup Hole is gonna
be ruined forever.

09:06.710 --> 09:10.120
Sometimes a small group
can make a big difference.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.750
But that's only if we're willing
to get out there and try.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.460
So, if you're with me, let's go!

09:20.670 --> 09:22.790
Okay, guys,
you know the plan.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.420
Start digging!

09:35.000 --> 09:36.540
They're coming!

09:40.500 --> 09:42.960
Steven! Chow time!

09:49.420 --> 09:50.460
Captain.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.920
Everybody haul tail!

10:10.500 --> 10:12.620
What a ravishing day!

10:12.620 --> 10:15.210
Almost as if
I designed it myself.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.460
Fresh air,

10:18.460 --> 10:20.880
sparkling water...

10:24.420 --> 10:28.670
humongous glowing blue
tsunami of slime?

10:33.040 --> 10:34.620
Yuck.

10:36.380 --> 10:39.710
That'll show old Cruella
what pollution's all about.

10:39.710 --> 10:42.540
Ugh! My pool!

10:42.540 --> 10:43.620
I'll sue!

10:43.620 --> 10:45.290
Who's responsible for this?

10:46.460 --> 10:47.710
Afternoon, ma'am. Ooh.

10:47.710 --> 10:50.620
Fools. My pool is ruined!

10:50.620 --> 10:51.670
And whoever heard

10:51.670 --> 10:54.460
of Cruella de Vil
with blue and white hair?

10:54.460 --> 10:57.580
There ought to be a law
against dumping gunk like this.

10:57.580 --> 10:59.170
There is.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.830
But you told us
to ignore it.

11:00.830 --> 11:04.500
But I didn't know that
it was going to affect me.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.420
This is an
environmental disaster.

11:08.420 --> 11:10.000
What she said.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.420
Both:
Note to myself,

11:11.420 --> 11:13.920
no longer pollute
local rivers and streams.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.120
It directly affects me.

11:21.210 --> 11:24.540
My Hiccup Hole is
as beautiful as ever.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.380
No more pollution.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.670
Cannonball!

11:31.460 --> 11:34.380
Except for
the spotted variety.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.330
Whoohoo!

11:52.330 --> 11:54.500
Whee!

12:05.670 --> 12:07.210
Whee!

12:17.210 --> 12:19.670
Ow. I think I pulled a nugget.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.830
Come on,
let's do it again!

12:23.830 --> 12:26.420
Cruella:
I want those
filthy animals out.

12:26.420 --> 12:29.880
-Out, out, out!

12:32.460 --> 12:34.120
Look at this mess.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.460
They've turned
this place into a barn.

12:36.460 --> 12:39.080
-This is a barn!

12:39.080 --> 12:42.420
Our barn!
And you can't kick out
our animals!

12:43.750 --> 12:45.120
You. Speak.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.420
After months
of mindless research...

12:47.420 --> 12:50.670
Ms. de Vil's legal team
has uncovered a clause
in the bill of sale...

12:50.670 --> 12:52.380
By which her ancestor,
Augusto de Vil,

12:52.380 --> 12:54.330
did relinquish ownership
of this property.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.670
But that was in 1732!

12:56.670 --> 13:00.290
And you thought
we'd forget it just like that.

13:00.290 --> 13:02.210
Read the fine print.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.210
"The area located
one half mile north

13:07.210 --> 13:09.330
"of Trickle Creek will truly
and verily be bestowed

13:09.330 --> 13:11.290
upon the meanest living member
of the de Vil family line."

13:11.290 --> 13:13.620
And that,
by happy coincidence,

13:13.620 --> 13:15.170
would be me.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.500
Let me see that.

13:18.790 --> 13:21.250
All right, here,
you left something out.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.330
"Said member
of the de Vil family

13:23.330 --> 13:25.790
"must establish residency
by dwelling therein

13:25.790 --> 13:30.330
"for a period of 24 hours
or else possession shall revert

13:30.330 --> 13:32.380
to the owners
of the surrounding property."

13:32.380 --> 13:34.710
Yes, yes, yes,
and exactly what does that mean?

13:35.750 --> 13:36.790
It means you...

13:36.790 --> 13:38.120
Have to live
in the barn overnight...

13:38.120 --> 13:39.460
Or the Dearlys get it back.

13:39.460 --> 13:41.920
A slumber party?

13:45.290 --> 13:48.210
Oh, it'll be tough,
but they'll manage.

13:51.420 --> 13:55.000
24 hours will be a breeze.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.330
Memo to myself:
draw up plans

13:57.330 --> 14:00.290
for De Vil Meat Packing Plant
and Petting Zoo.

14:00.290 --> 14:03.080
-I love synergy.

14:04.790 --> 14:07.250
Cruella's moving into the barn?

14:07.250 --> 14:11.290
Oh, we'll all be homeless!

14:11.290 --> 14:14.250
Starving puppies
going from door to door,

14:14.250 --> 14:17.210
begging for scraps.

14:17.210 --> 14:21.750
I have always depended
upon the kibble of strangers.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.580
Aw, she's bluffing.

14:23.580 --> 14:26.620
No way she'll move
into this old barn.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.500
A little more,
a little more--

14:31.500 --> 14:35.210
A little less.
A little less.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.790
Just bluffing, huh?

14:38.790 --> 14:41.710
All right, Cruella,
I can't stop you
from moving in,

14:41.710 --> 14:44.250
but you have to stay
a full 24 hours.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.250
Not one second less.

14:46.250 --> 14:49.120
And, uh, I'll be watching.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.120
Scorchy...

15:13.120 --> 15:16.500
the sacrifices
one must make.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.290
Now where's my cappuccino maker?

15:18.290 --> 15:19.880
I'm right here, ma'am.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.540
Oh, man! She's taking over
the whole barn!

15:23.540 --> 15:26.330
At least we still got TV.

15:28.620 --> 15:31.170
Man 1:
Next on The All Dog Network,

15:31.170 --> 15:33.620
Thunderbolt PI
collars the crooks when--

15:34.880 --> 15:36.460
Man 2:
Next on
The All Fashion Network,

15:36.460 --> 15:38.330
the latest look
from the fall line

15:38.330 --> 15:40.080
of Jean Claude Zurrel.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.120
-Can't wait.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.210
Memo to myself:
have Jean Claude Zurrel deported

15:44.210 --> 15:46.250
and steal
his fall fashion ideas.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.250
-Oh!

15:53.120 --> 15:55.920
What is that noise?

15:55.920 --> 15:58.790
How can I concentrate
with that awful squeaking?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.380
Bring that... thing here.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.380
See? I fixed it.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.620
Now it doesn't make
that awful squeaking anymore.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.330
Yep, the world may
turn against ya,

16:33.330 --> 16:37.170
but food is always your friend.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.330
Cruella!

16:38.330 --> 16:41.120
Ah, Emilio,

16:41.120 --> 16:44.170
my favorite
overpriced nutritionist.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.880
Command me.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.000
What shall I eat today?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.080
Stop!

16:50.120 --> 16:52.460
Oh, there's red meat in here!

16:52.460 --> 16:56.460
Oh, my arteries are
clogging as we speak!

16:56.460 --> 16:59.080
-Maybe it's the cows.
-No...

16:59.080 --> 17:01.620
no, it's coming from...

17:02.670 --> 17:03.920
this!

17:09.120 --> 17:11.120
-You need some of this.

17:11.120 --> 17:15.710
There, a healthy "carputi"
plankton chowder.

17:15.710 --> 17:18.080
Aah! It's alive!

17:20.170 --> 17:23.330
Ohh, that feels divine.

17:23.330 --> 17:27.250
Like tiny feet running up
and down my back.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.540
All right.

17:30.540 --> 17:34.210
Time for the hydro-jet
whirlpool water therapy.

17:34.210 --> 17:37.000
Ugh! There's no room
for the jacuzzi.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.880
There's got to be some place.

17:44.420 --> 17:47.170
This is awful.
She's taken our stuff,

17:47.170 --> 17:50.460
she's taken our space,
she's taken our food.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.000
Look on the bright side.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.330
At least we still have
our self-respect.

17:54.330 --> 17:57.540
Spot, we're living
in a bookcase.

17:59.330 --> 18:01.290
All right, that's it!

18:01.290 --> 18:03.210
Time to take action.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.080
Just a good night's sleep

18:09.080 --> 18:12.880
and tomorrow morning,
the barn will be mine.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.000
It's almost too easy.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.290
What?

18:27.290 --> 18:29.620
Quiet, you little beasts!

18:40.460 --> 18:43.120
I can't stand it anymore!

18:43.120 --> 18:44.620
I'm leaving!

18:44.620 --> 18:47.170
Leaving this psycho zone

18:47.170 --> 18:49.920
and entering
a plane of tranquility.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.330
-Ah, that's better.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.040
Lucky:
There it is!

18:57.040 --> 18:59.120
She loves that thing.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.790
She'll have to come after it.

19:08.290 --> 19:09.380
What?

19:09.380 --> 19:12.750
Hey! That's my Memo Master 3000!

19:13.750 --> 19:15.380
Give it to me,
you little runt!

19:17.960 --> 19:19.170
Whoa!

19:19.170 --> 19:23.040
Wait, if I step outside,
I lose my claim.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.920
And I know that miserable Robbie
is on the lookout.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.460
But nothing says
I can't stick my hand outside.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.290
Oh!

19:39.290 --> 19:40.880
Whoa!

19:42.170 --> 19:43.460
Aah!

19:43.460 --> 19:45.290
Memo to myself...

19:45.290 --> 19:47.120
but new Memo Master.

20:27.580 --> 20:29.750
We're running out of time!

20:29.750 --> 20:32.750
If we could only reach
Cruella's inner child,

20:32.750 --> 20:34.420
maybe she'd let us stay.

20:34.420 --> 20:39.920
Cadpig, Cruella's inner child
is probably doing 10 to 20

20:39.920 --> 20:42.000
in a juvenile detention center.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.920
No, Cadpig's right.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.380
Maybe we can't
drive Cruella out.

20:46.380 --> 20:50.790
But we can make her like us
enough to keep us around.

20:50.790 --> 20:52.920
Too bad I'm not a masseuse.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.790
And I'm not a nutritionist.

20:54.790 --> 20:57.290
And I'm not a manicurist.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.000
If only I had an idea.

21:10.790 --> 21:13.750
Ooh, that's wonderful.

21:15.210 --> 21:18.710
Ah, a hand bath. Mm.

21:21.420 --> 21:22.790
Hm?

21:22.790 --> 21:26.960
Oh, and a massage too.

21:26.960 --> 21:33.250
Ah, it's like little, tiny feet
running up and down my back.

21:33.250 --> 21:37.380
Ah, oh, isn't that sweet.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.960
My bed is filled
with puppy dogs

21:39.960 --> 21:43.420
licking and crawling
all over me.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.460
Germs! Disease! Fleas!

21:47.460 --> 21:48.710
Oh!

21:55.210 --> 21:57.920
Well, Cruella,
you left the barn.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.710
From now on, we own it
and the puppies stay.

22:02.420 --> 22:03.580
Fine.
