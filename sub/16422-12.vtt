You put her in harm's

00:06.026 --> 00:07.958
Marriage is about family.

00:07.959 --> 00:09.659
There's no point doing it
if you can't have children.

00:15.627 --> 00:17.793
If we went to a tribunal,

00:17.794 --> 00:20.459
it wouldn't just be because
I can't have children.

00:20.460 --> 00:24.459
I knew before we were married,
and I kept it from you.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.459
You lied to me.

00:26.460 --> 00:30.325
Elizabeth Bligh, will you marry me?

00:30.326 --> 00:31.859
Yes.

00:31.860 --> 00:32.992
Yes, I will.

00:32.993 --> 00:36.492
Well, some months ago I
succumbed to blackmail,

00:36.493 --> 00:40.793
the very thing we all fear, and I caved.

dustman for all we know.

00:51.527 --> 00:52.659
Or George Bligh.

One day she may stand trial,
but first things first,

I want to deal with the
fact that she's...

01:15.593 --> 01:16.925
well, she's mentally unhinged.

01:16.926 --> 01:20.259
Yeah. No one needs to
know she's gone gaga.

No, sir.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.058
I'm not sure.

02:53.059 --> 02:54.759
You hesitated.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.925
I was as surprised as anyone else

02:56.926 --> 02:58.092
when she wasn't in her room.

02:58.093 --> 02:59.392
What do you know, girl?

02:59.393 --> 03:00.859
She is choosing her words.

13:33.093 --> 13:35.527
Mummy's here. It's okay.

13:48.326 --> 13:51.559
This assures no one believes her
ravings as we move forward.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.192
It gives her the perfect plea.

13:53.193 --> 13:55.893
No! No! No!

13:55.894 --> 13:58.325
No-o-o!

13:58.326 --> 14:00.426
You'll pay!

14:00.427 --> 14:01.592
All of you!

14:01.593 --> 14:02.459
Bitch!

14:02.460 --> 14:04.592
It's all right, Mrs. Bligh.
We're not here to hurt you.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.192

- Barkin'.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.025
Must be a way to see her
charged without committal.

14:12.026 --> 14:16.392
As I said, secure and disarmed
while they make a full case.

14:16.393 --> 14:18.793
We'll sedate her until she settles.

14:18.794 --> 14:21.159
- Thank you, Doctor.
- I'll keep you informed.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.793
She will be lashing out.

14:22.794 --> 14:24.925
They frequently do.

14:26.193 --> 14:28.325
- You all right?
- Yes.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.860

Here, sir. She's that upset.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.058
Rose. I've been looking all over.

15:05.059 --> 15:07.958
(CRYING) She's been so kind to me.

15:07.959 --> 15:09.726
I didn't want this to happen.

15:09.727 --> 15:11.559
- She's not crazy.
- She is.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.225
No.

15:13.226 --> 15:15.726
The sins she's committed.

15:15.727 --> 15:18.059
And they needed you to help Mr.
Bligh see.

15:19.593 --> 15:20.926
That's all.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.459
You should have asked me.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.326
Trusted me.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.059
Why didn't you?

15:31.993 --> 15:33.325
- Rose...
- No.

15:33.326 --> 15:34.692
Rose.

15:34.693 --> 15:36.659
- Where are you going?
- I'm just going!

15:36.660 --> 15:37.693
Rose, I'm sorry.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.993
(DOOR CLOSES)

15:45.160 --> 15:47.893
I thought you might need me.

15:47.894 --> 15:49.459
How is he?

15:49.460 --> 15:51.893
He was dashing around
looking for her when I left

15:51.894 --> 15:53.325
and inveighing against the family.

15:53.326 --> 15:55.958
- Don't do anything foolish.
- It's over.

15:55.959 --> 15:57.659
- Anna!
- No, it is.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.826
He won't forgive me.

15:59.827 --> 16:01.759
There's Rose.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.225
I'm barren.

16:03.226 --> 16:04.592
And I kept it from him.

16:04.593 --> 16:06.726
- Darling...
- And there's more to come.

16:06.727 --> 16:08.259
What do you mean?

16:08.260 --> 16:11.225
I deliberately encouraged
him to hire Harry.

16:11.226 --> 16:14.459
When he finds out that
Harry's like James?

16:14.460 --> 16:17.225
It's another lie he has
every right to hate me for.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.759
Probably the straw that
breaks the camel's back.

16:20.760 --> 16:21.827
And I want to go.

16:22.593 --> 16:24.759
- Darling...
- No, I do. I do.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.726
If I stay, we'll become
one of those couples

16:26.727 --> 16:28.092
that everyone pities.

16:28.093 --> 16:31.759
"Poor Anna and Gino. They
used to be so happy."

16:31.760 --> 16:36.659
I'm giving him back his future,
and I'm accepting my own.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.860
But you love him.

16:39.794 --> 16:42.326
That's why I've never felt so sure.

16:46.126 --> 16:50.459
I do feel that there are others
more worthy of your concern.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.058
Do it because you want
to, not because of me.

16:52.059 --> 16:53.793
Oh, Gino, there'll be
no "want" about it.

16:53.794 --> 16:55.559
She's nothing more than a sly minx.

16:55.560 --> 16:58.492
However, I will pander to
your sentimental request

16:58.493 --> 17:00.159
by dismissing her with a reference.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.526
But after warning Regina,
she is lucky to get that.

17:02.527 --> 17:03.459
Forget it.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.392
- No, I...
- You do more harm than good.

17:05.393 --> 17:06.727
Easy, son.

17:08.859 --> 17:11.425
Write the reference.
Stick it in the hallway.

17:11.426 --> 17:12.726
We'll grab it on the way out.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.392
- But you...
- I'm taking her home.

17:14.393 --> 17:15.459
And Anna?

17:15.460 --> 17:17.125
No, I don't care what Anna thinks.

17:17.126 --> 17:18.826
Gino, I do not appreciate your tone.

17:18.827 --> 17:21.059
That's too bad.

17:25.859 --> 17:28.392
His recent disappointments
forgive just so much.

17:28.393 --> 17:31.092
It wouldn't kill you to offer
the girl some comfort.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.793
Oh, please!

17:32.794 --> 17:34.526
It might kill you if
you don't calm down.

17:34.527 --> 17:37.893
I will not be patronized, Douglas.

17:37.894 --> 17:39.392
We'll talk tomorrow.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.659
Douglas, I expect your support.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.392
I won't be your lapdog.

17:44.393 --> 17:46.593
I'll send in Jack.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.225
James and Olivia?

18:02.226 --> 18:03.592
I called.

18:03.593 --> 18:05.926
- They know to take care.
- Good.

18:08.527 --> 18:10.159
Pen and paper.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.592
No, no, no, no.

18:11.593 --> 18:13.393
(CLEARS THROAT) I'm all right.

18:27.827 --> 18:31.392
Was that a glimpse of your
wartime self tonight?

18:31.393 --> 18:33.727
No, she'd be dead if it was.

18:35.393 --> 18:39.526
I should have gone higher
than Taylor straightaway.

18:39.527 --> 18:41.527
They wouldn't have believed you.

18:42.527 --> 18:45.058
And I understand.

18:45.059 --> 18:47.559
If you'd come to me, I...

18:47.560 --> 18:49.627
I may have let you down as well.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.726
I'm sorry.

18:53.727 --> 18:57.559
No, there's no apology needed.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.326
She was frighteningly plausible.

19:02.026 --> 19:04.492
I intend to see the
commissioner tomorrow,

19:04.493 --> 19:06.459
provide a statement.

19:06.460 --> 19:08.925
Everyone will have to in the long run,

19:08.926 --> 19:11.859
about everything that's transpired.

19:11.860 --> 19:15.025
Starting with Milly Davis.

19:15.026 --> 19:17.225
Well, with any luck, I'll
have something for you

19:17.226 --> 19:18.326
to set the seal.

19:19.693 --> 19:21.925
Drop by tomorrow morning.

19:21.926 --> 19:26.093
You can meet the man Regina
encouraged to kill me.

19:30.959 --> 19:33.392
No one will believe her
now she's committed.

19:33.393 --> 19:36.393
- When it comes to court...
- She will try and ruin us.

19:37.727 --> 19:39.159
I was tasked with your education,

19:39.160 --> 19:41.925
and I'm the one that's
learnt the lesson.

19:41.926 --> 19:43.958
What a house of straw
we deviants live in.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.427
Don't.

19:47.827 --> 19:50.059
I always presumed myself safe.

19:51.160 --> 19:55.192
We just have to see you both
buffered when the time comes.

19:55.193 --> 19:56.559
The morphine.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.526
It's her word against yours.

19:58.527 --> 20:01.925
- Your family won't forgive it.
- I won't give them a choice.

20:01.926 --> 20:03.958
You're clearly not the only victim.

20:03.959 --> 20:08.626
The main concern is any
sexual allegations.

20:08.627 --> 20:11.392
So, until the trial,

20:11.393 --> 20:13.426
we will play our roles to perfection.

20:13.427 --> 20:16.526
It could take months.

20:16.527 --> 20:18.025
You're prepared to stay?

20:18.026 --> 20:20.159
We will present a face to the world

20:24.393 --> 20:25.427
Our love.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.526
Your love.

20:28.527 --> 20:31.326

20:34.126 --> 20:36.727
I'll leave you two to say good night.

20:40.093 --> 20:43.359
She hurt you in using you.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.326
Don't add to it through blame.

20:51.527 --> 20:54.760
I will have to stay here tonight.

20:55.727 --> 20:56.959
And...

20:57.959 --> 21:00.659
...if you feel comfortable,

21:00.660 --> 21:03.593
I'd really like to be
held while I fall asleep.

Never once said a kind word

25:50.059 --> 25:51.958
about her not being
able to have children.

She shouldn't have to blame
herself for everything.

27:51.393 --> 27:52.992
(KNOCKING)

27:52.993 --> 27:57.325
- Good morning.
- Good morning, um...

27:57.326 --> 27:59.459
George Bligh, this is Gordon Walsh,

27:59.460 --> 28:02.794
the late Milly Davis' fiancé.

28:06.260 --> 28:09.726
Well, this man's testimony will
certainly support the case.

28:09.727 --> 28:11.559
He's brave. I'll give him that.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.626
Prepared to reveal all to the police.

28:13.627 --> 28:16.726
Well, he craves justice, I'm sure.

28:16.727 --> 28:19.460
- Good luck.
- I'll report in.

28:21.059 --> 28:23.626
- Do you still want this?
- I will take it.

28:23.627 --> 28:25.225
It might help explain
to the commissioner

28:25.226 --> 28:27.958
the catalyst for the
events of last night.

28:27.959 --> 28:30.392
Would you like me to see
Anna whilst I'm in the city?

28:30.393 --> 28:31.826
Perhaps give her time.

28:31.827 --> 28:34.459
She's with Olivia today.
Jack's seeing Gino.

28:34.460 --> 28:36.626
Well, let me know if
there's anything I can do.

28:36.627 --> 28:37.827
I will.

28:42.226 --> 28:45.592
I bear a portion of the blame. For Anna.

28:45.593 --> 28:48.159
Rose is simply the tip of the iceberg.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.392
She's what brought it to a head.

28:50.393 --> 28:51.560
Do you see no hope?

28:53.126 --> 28:55.925
Anna doesn't, more to the point.

28:55.926 --> 28:57.426
A sad old tale.

28:57.427 --> 28:59.325
What would have happened
to Romeo and Juliet

28:59.326 --> 29:00.492
if they hadn't died?

29:00.493 --> 29:03.659
Or met late in life.

29:03.660 --> 29:06.727
I've my own breach to heal. Excuse me.

29:18.460 --> 29:19.860
DOUGLAS: (SIGHS)

29:24.460 --> 29:26.393
A personal favorite.

29:27.393 --> 29:29.059
It or me?

29:30.460 --> 29:32.925
Thank you.

29:32.926 --> 29:35.793
Your quip gives me hope.

29:35.794 --> 29:39.794
I did warn you that I could
be other than as you know me.

29:40.959 --> 29:43.859
But I thought that
incarnation had vanished.

29:43.860 --> 29:46.192
Crisis loosed her from her lair.

29:46.193 --> 29:48.759
She's Elizabeth Bligh of Ash Park.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.426
I prefer Lizzie.

29:50.427 --> 29:53.393
(LAUGHS) So do I, actually.

29:54.393 --> 29:58.026
Would you trust me to drive a
stake through the monster?

29:59.059 --> 30:02.025
Yes. I do.

30:02.026 --> 30:05.426
Although I'm disturbed by your
metaphor from Mr. Bram Stoker.

30:05.427 --> 30:09.427
(LAUGHS) There she is.
The Lizzie I love.

30:11.593 --> 30:13.058
Let's get away.

30:13.059 --> 30:15.426
Avoid Ash Park.

30:15.427 --> 30:17.593
Except for the big occasions.

30:18.393 --> 30:21.059
Trust me, will you?

30:22.427 --> 30:23.794
Yes.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.093
We'll trust each other.

30:31.326 --> 30:34.058
For a favorite.

30:34.059 --> 30:35.360
My favorite.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.592
You're going off half-cocked, mate.

31:00.593 --> 31:03.426
Mum and Dad said I could
sell the farm if I wanted.

31:03.427 --> 31:05.159
I'll find a place that's
better for vines.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.058
You won't have George's
backing somewhere else.

31:07.059 --> 31:09.026
I don't want anything from them.

31:10.026 --> 31:11.392
Not anymore.

31:11.393 --> 31:13.592
They did what they had to.

31:13.593 --> 31:15.160
So am I.

31:17.126 --> 31:18.392
Rose seems fine.

31:18.393 --> 31:20.793
- Don't go blaming her for...
- I want children.

31:20.794 --> 31:22.992
Anna can't have them.

31:22.993 --> 31:24.592
And she wants a life I can't give her.

31:24.593 --> 31:26.059
Rose isn't the problem.

31:28.993 --> 31:30.492
You fought so hard to be together.

31:30.493 --> 31:31.325
We were young.

31:31.326 --> 31:33.692
We thought we knew better.
We were blind.

31:33.693 --> 31:35.726
It's all in Anna's letter.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.992
"Better we separate before
we hate each other."

31:37.993 --> 31:40.192
Oh, she... she's confused too.

31:40.193 --> 31:42.459
The way I feel,

31:42.460 --> 31:44.693
we left it too late.

31:46.126 --> 31:50.059
If you could both just
maybe talk to Father Joe.

31:52.326 --> 31:53.326
I'd like you to go.

31:54.326 --> 31:55.325
Come on, Gino.

31:55.326 --> 31:56.759
You're the best of the
lot, Jack, I mean it,

31:56.760 --> 31:59.392
but please, just... just go
and don't come back, hmm?

31:59.393 --> 32:00.392
Goodbye.

32:00.393 --> 32:01.826
No.

32:01.827 --> 32:03.958
Come on, you can't. You can't...

32:03.959 --> 32:06.560
I can. All the best for the future.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.526
Keep an eye on him.

32:21.527 --> 32:22.827
I will.

32:35.460 --> 32:38.093
(VEHICLE DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

(ENGINE STARTS)

32:43.093 --> 32:45.326
(VEHICLE DEPARTS)

33:00.059 --> 33:03.459
I'm agog at the sign I just saw.

33:03.460 --> 33:05.259
You'll be more than that
if you go up there.

33:05.260 --> 33:07.392
- Go about your business.
- Doctor?

33:07.393 --> 33:10.826
As much as you love a gossip,
you know when it's no help.

33:10.827 --> 33:12.559
You're upset.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.159
I'm ruddy heartbroken.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.559
Well, in that case,

33:17.560 --> 33:20.626
I shall continue foraging
for blackberries,

33:20.627 --> 33:24.392
and woe betide anyone who
broaches the matter with me,

33:24.393 --> 33:27.093
whatever that matter might be.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.159
You're a good stick, Doris.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.760
Ah, yes.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.325
Do you remember the day
at the water hole,

33:45.326 --> 33:47.692
just after I'd arrived?

33:47.693 --> 33:50.325
You held my hand and we jumped in.

33:50.326 --> 33:51.727
(BOTH LAUGH)

33:52.693 --> 33:54.859
We were so happy.

33:54.860 --> 33:56.859
Innocent.

33:56.860 --> 33:59.459
If only we'd known.

33:59.460 --> 34:03.427
It was the day I first
truly felt us friends.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.992
But you're leaving soon.

34:06.993 --> 34:09.225
There's no reason to dash off.

34:09.226 --> 34:10.826
Your own life?

34:10.827 --> 34:12.527
Can find me wherever I am.

34:15.393 --> 34:17.958
The sad thing is, Livvy, I...

34:17.958 --> 34:19.393
I still love him.

34:21.993 --> 34:23.626
And I James.

34:23.627 --> 34:25.525
But...

34:25.527 --> 34:28.092
But it seems they're
better off without us.

34:29.360 --> 34:33.992
I see Gino with children,
a wife and a vineyard.

34:33.993 --> 34:39.092
It makes me happy, but
it breaks my heart.

34:40.193 --> 34:42.458
Anna...

34:42.460 --> 34:47.560
I see you as a successful writer.

34:52.860 --> 34:55.326
We can find ourselves together.

35:01.727 --> 35:04.859
Men are such brutes. Poor darlings.

35:04.860 --> 35:06.526
TOM: They're sports, the
way they've joined us.

35:06.527 --> 35:09.727
If either decides to forego
men, the girls will swarm.

35:10.860 --> 35:12.992
You're like that old
recruitment poster...

35:16.160 --> 35:17.459

- What?
- Your first camp quip.

35:19.393 --> 35:20.459
My training is complete.

35:20.460 --> 35:22.225
Is not. I've made them before.

35:22.226 --> 35:24.925
- Not around me.
- You should be on James' side.

35:24.926 --> 35:26.225
Well, he hasn't.

35:26.226 --> 35:28.992
Look at you two. Smitten.

35:28.993 --> 35:30.526
We need to get Harry to town.

35:30.527 --> 35:32.393
You should. What's in Inverness?

35:33.693 --> 35:35.526
You. Sarah.

35:35.527 --> 35:37.360
Friends are friends wherever you are.

35:38.926 --> 35:41.325

35:41.326 --> 35:43.325
I'm sure we could find you a job.

35:43.326 --> 35:44.958
Why would you?

35:44.959 --> 35:47.126
Who wants to explain?

35:48.460 --> 35:51.593
Well, it's like today, bringing
us here to cheer us up.

35:52.993 --> 35:55.559
Our kind has two families, Harry.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.325
The one we're born with,

35:58.326 --> 35:59.959
and the one we collect along the way.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.627
It supports us against a hostile world.

36:07.593 --> 36:09.392
Welcome to the family.

36:09.393 --> 36:12.193
Ain't love grand? (LAUGHS)

36:13.393 --> 36:14.659
You're right.

36:14.660 --> 36:16.059
We will.

37:06.727 --> 37:08.592
You look like an advertisement.

thinking at this point.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.392
God's in his heaven. All's
right with the world.

37:22.393 --> 37:23.592
What was that?

37:23.593 --> 37:27.359
It's just a quote. Robert Browning.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.660
"God's in his heaven and

38:04.593 --> 38:07.626
Well, this is a speech, I must say,

38:07.627 --> 38:12.125
I... I never expected to
make until very recently.

- Nor I to hear.

38:18.827 --> 38:20.925
Delighted. Thrilled.

And in my case, vindicated.

38:23.193 --> 38:24.392

38:24.393 --> 38:27.992
Elizabeth never would accept any
of my predictions of wedlock.

38:27.993 --> 38:29.992
But I will accept a little
bit of shush, dear.

38:29.993 --> 38:32.058
But I thought perhaps Miss Nordmann...

38:32.059 --> 38:34.726
Oh, no, I do know. You introduced them.

38:34.727 --> 38:36.925

38:36.926 --> 38:39.958
I accept your mildest of rebukes, dear.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.058

38:41.059 --> 38:45.125
You were saying... a speech
you never expected to make.

38:45.126 --> 38:46.392
Thank you, Prudence.

38:46.393 --> 38:49.392
The youngest amongst us will
have to take me on faith

when I say that you reach an
age where you assume a parent

38:52.427 --> 38:55.925
will embrace a settled life.

38:55.926 --> 38:59.225
For Mother, I saw predictable years.

It's hard.

40:55.093 --> 40:59.259
Knowing that he's over
there, about to leave.

40:59.260 --> 41:02.459
I had hoped he'd soften enough
to at least to say goodbye.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.026
So had I.

41:07.126 --> 41:09.859
Why don't you take the lead?

41:09.860 --> 41:12.025
If a farewell is important.

41:12.026 --> 41:13.727
Go over there?

41:16.260 --> 41:21.025
Be prepared to feel
worse, but it may help.

41:21.026 --> 41:22.560
I don't know.

41:23.860 --> 41:26.492
If you decide, just slip out.

41:26.493 --> 41:28.160
I'll make your excuses.

41:32.527 --> 41:34.159
No, you're right.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.392
It's worth the risk. Come on.

Please. You and Mama.

41:49.959 --> 41:52.193
Certainly brings a finality to it.

41:53.326 --> 41:55.125
I'm glad our day's delayed.

41:55.126 --> 41:56.193
Indefinitely.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.626
Perhaps now is time to mention it.

42:00.627 --> 42:02.160
What?

42:03.460 --> 42:05.726
I've decided my future.

42:05.727 --> 42:07.626
Henry's showed the way.

42:07.627 --> 42:09.392
And what is it? He never said.

42:09.393 --> 42:11.259
It's mine to tell.

42:11.260 --> 42:13.125
I swore him to silence.

42:13.126 --> 42:16.125
You will be astounded.

42:16.126 --> 42:18.025
Excuse me, ma'am.

42:18.026 --> 42:20.759
Mrs. Collins has arrived
with a wedding present.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.459
She didn't want to leave
without my telling you.

42:23.460 --> 42:25.259
I knew something was
missing from the day.

42:25.260 --> 42:26.526
Behave yourself, George.

42:26.527 --> 42:27.692
Send her in.

42:27.693 --> 42:30.793
Isn't she that alarming woman
who's always saying "indeed"?

42:30.794 --> 42:32.692
Once met, never forgotten.

42:32.693 --> 42:37.526
She's a kind, dear soul in a
sometimes-irritating package.

42:37.527 --> 42:40.159
That's my Lizzie.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.526
Oh! Mrs. Bligh!

42:42.527 --> 42:45.192
Oh, pardon... Mrs. Goddard.

42:45.193 --> 42:47.526
Do you know I have not
ventured from town

42:47.527 --> 42:50.592
since stumbling across
poor Sergeant Taylor.

42:50.593 --> 42:51.759
Dreadful.

42:51.760 --> 42:55.392
Even months later, I feel quite unsafe.

42:55.393 --> 42:57.592
But I said to myself, Doris Collins,

42:57.593 --> 42:59.459
friendship before fear.

42:59.460 --> 43:01.392
So it was on my bike, and here I am.

43:01.393 --> 43:06.826
And I am struck dumb with the
honor of being invited in.

43:06.827 --> 43:08.392
Indeed I am.

43:08.393 --> 43:10.794
A happy day for all.

43:26.126 --> 43:28.325
Gino!

43:28.326 --> 43:29.893
No truck.

43:29.894 --> 43:32.526
- Perhaps...
- He'd be here, if he was here.

43:32.527 --> 43:33.926
Gino!

43:36.527 --> 43:38.326
Gino?

43:39.393 --> 43:41.560
(DOORKNOB RATTLING)

43:42.527 --> 43:43.959
Gino!

43:44.059 --> 43:46.159
Gino!

43:46.160 --> 43:48.059
(SOBBING)

43:53.493 --> 43:54.993
It's happened!

44:17.560 --> 44:20.259
I trust the tea's to your liking.

44:20.260 --> 44:22.392
As only you can make it.

44:22.393 --> 44:24.827
Anything for you, my darling.

44:26.260 --> 44:28.393
I do love you, you know?

44:31.593 --> 44:33.460
I forgive you.

44:36.326 --> 44:39.125
She made you do it.

44:39.126 --> 44:40.959
She'll suffer.

44:48.193 --> 44:50.260
That whore and her brat.

44:50.326 --> 44:52.192
That whore and her brat!

44:52.193 --> 44:55.393
What was the point of the camps?!

45:06.193 --> 45:07.794
(SIGHS)

45:15.860 --> 45:19.392
Tell her the deal is, nothing
about George and me,

45:19.393 --> 45:21.392
but all the dirt on the family.

45:21.393 --> 45:25.058
And for that, we'll get her
off as lightly as possible.

45:25.059 --> 45:26.326
Sit down.

45:27.894 --> 45:30.392
Well, she's not up to it yet.

45:30.393 --> 45:32.325
She's still gaga.

45:32.326 --> 45:35.925
Well, when she is.

45:35.926 --> 45:38.125
What's the best we can pull off for her?

45:38.126 --> 45:39.726
Well, without a formal confession,

45:39.727 --> 45:43.092
any case for killing the
teacher is circumstantial.

45:43.093 --> 45:45.759
And the cop, Taylor, he
crossed union radicals.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.359
They could have tracked
him down, shot him.

45:48.360 --> 45:51.325
The only statement
linking Regina and him

45:51.326 --> 45:53.659
is from the air force chap, and
there's nothing too concrete.

45:53.660 --> 45:56.526
But let's say they do
pull a case together,

45:56.527 --> 45:58.726
which they well may not.

45:58.727 --> 46:01.159
We'll just say she was
driven to drugs and despair

46:01.160 --> 46:04.759
at her husband's infidelity, and
they impaired her judgment.

46:04.760 --> 46:07.259
She wasn't responsible for her actions.

46:07.260 --> 46:10.459
And not too much mud on George.

46:10.460 --> 46:12.392
He still has his uses.

46:12.393 --> 46:15.925
Well, he'd be sullied but viable.

46:15.926 --> 46:18.058
Good.

46:18.059 --> 46:20.925
May I ask you why you're backing her?

46:20.926 --> 46:24.793
For a dish I tried to deliver hot.

46:24.794 --> 46:28.693
But they do say it's best served cold.

46:37.326 --> 46:38.193
(SIGHS)

46:42.393 --> 46:44.192
No sign of Anna?

46:44.193 --> 46:46.325
Not yet.

46:46.326 --> 46:48.992
Are you feeling all right
with all the excitement?

46:48.993 --> 46:52.992
I am. I'm just taking a
moment to count my blessings.

46:52.993 --> 46:55.992
- I'll leave you to it, then.
- No, Sarah, stay.

46:55.993 --> 46:57.993
You're very much one of them.

47:01.026 --> 47:03.460
You wouldn't have said so once.

47:04.926 --> 47:07.793
Which makes it all the
more precious now.

47:07.794 --> 47:09.427
Yes, it does.

47:14.126 --> 47:16.527
What vistas ahead.

47:18.860 --> 47:21.392
A whole new generation.

47:21.393 --> 47:23.626
May we stand as firm as the old.

47:23.627 --> 47:26.958
(LAUGHS) You will.

47:26.959 --> 47:28.759
It almost calls for a toast.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.125
It does.

47:30.126 --> 47:32.092
I know you're dying to say it. Go on.

47:32.093 --> 47:33.959
You're as bad as George.

47:35.660 --> 47:37.093
Why don't you?

47:38.727 --> 47:41.727
- Have we come that far?
- I think we have.

47:43.760 --> 47:44.926
Then...

47:46.860 --> 47:49.760
L'chaim, my dear friend.

47:52.660 --> 47:54.126
To life.

47:58.460 --> 48:00.059
