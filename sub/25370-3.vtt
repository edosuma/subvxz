00:01.214 --> 00:03.383
Don, that is simply not an option.

00:03.389 --> 00:06.150
Unless... I can find a
way to subvert the trial.

00:07.218 --> 00:08.423
- Argh!
- Chicken!

00:08.429 --> 00:12.162
That bitch set me up
and she tried to kill me.

00:12.168 --> 00:16.018
You and I are going to out Don Kaplan.

00:16.071 --> 00:17.388
Oh!

00:17.394 --> 00:18.594
Ruby!

00:18.600 --> 00:20.879
There's your cut and there's
plenty more where that came from.

00:20.885 --> 00:22.170
All I have is boxing

00:22.176 --> 00:24.268
and it's the most important
thing in the world to me.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.510
- I'm pregnant.
- To Jake?

00:26.516 --> 00:27.873
Police are on their way.

00:27.879 --> 00:29.144
Shit!

00:29.150 --> 00:31.050
Franky Doyle, stop
and give yourself up!

02:46.041 --> 02:48.448
- Gotta get to the hospital, babe.
- They'll be checkin' hospitals.

02:48.454 --> 02:51.357

- No, Gidge, please.

02:51.363 --> 02:52.563

02:52.569 --> 02:53.912
I've got a place.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.479
Should you be drivin'?

03:08.234 --> 03:09.434
Nuh.

03:29.656 --> 03:31.374
Stay with me, baby.

03:31.568 --> 03:34.468
...not known whether Doyle was
actually harmed at the time.

03:34.474 --> 03:36.673

- Hey, get out here, quick!

- Francesca Doyle, was shot during the

03:41.256 --> 03:42.456
- manic altercation with police.
- It's Franky, look.

03:42.462 --> 03:44.248
- Oh, shit!
- What, have they caught her?

03:44.254 --> 03:46.142
- Now, reports suggest police arrived here at the scene
- Nah, but they fuckin' shot her but, 'ey?!

03:46.148 --> 03:47.668
- after receiving a tip off
- Ya fuckin' pigs!

03:47.674 --> 03:48.874
- from a member of the public that Doyle was...
- Birdsworth!

03:48.879 --> 03:50.079
- Yeah.
- Visitors Centre.

03:50.085 --> 03:51.363
...seen in the area. When they arrived

03:51.369 --> 03:52.718
- they confronted her
- Oh...

03:52.724 --> 03:54.196
- here by the train tracks...
- won't be long 'til she's back.

04:02.071 --> 04:03.271
Morning.

04:09.156 --> 04:11.477
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

04:11.483 --> 04:14.156
All women report to
assigned work duties.

04:16.860 --> 04:19.745
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

04:19.750 --> 04:24.055
All women report to
assigned work duties.

04:31.677 --> 04:33.662
This is shit, Kim!

04:35.269 --> 04:36.567
Give it here!

04:36.573 --> 04:37.974
What am I?

04:39.186 --> 04:40.416
Hey, Rita...

04:40.422 --> 04:42.760
- do you wanna come and sit with us?
- Sure.

04:48.510 --> 04:49.710
Boomer.

04:49.716 --> 04:53.465
Looks like Kaz is
recruiting a small army.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.133
Hey, Susan... not tempted are you?

04:56.444 --> 04:57.644
What to...

04:57.650 --> 05:00.249
- a what?
- Join Kaz's Band of Merry Men.

05:00.255 --> 05:02.818
"Punch some tits", as
you like to call it.

05:02.824 --> 05:06.085
Ah... I'm gonna go and make a cuppa tea.

05:06.091 --> 05:07.291
- Hey, Liz...
- Hmm?

05:07.297 --> 05:10.413
- You haven't offered.
- Oh... oh, does anyone want one?

05:10.419 --> 05:11.928
For fuck's sake.

05:11.998 --> 05:13.198
Rita?

05:13.716 --> 05:15.333
Uh, I'll give you a hand.

05:15.339 --> 05:16.622
No, no, no, that's all
right, Liz can do it.

05:16.628 --> 05:18.653
She's very adept at
making tea, aren't you Liz?

05:20.224 --> 05:22.331
Yeah. That's okay.

05:22.337 --> 05:24.234
Coffee, um, black with three.

05:24.973 --> 05:26.173
- Liz...
- Yeah?

05:26.179 --> 05:28.203
Um... I'll pass.

05:29.757 --> 05:32.113
Why are you so chummy with her again?

05:32.483 --> 05:34.093
I don't understand.

05:41.523 --> 05:42.723
It's good for ya.

05:55.463 --> 05:56.663
No!

05:57.349 --> 06:00.782
No! No! No!

06:01.400 --> 06:02.600
No!

06:03.181 --> 06:04.499
No!

06:04.697 --> 06:06.323
Get me out of here!

06:06.727 --> 06:09.792
- This just stops!
- Shit! Argh! Fuck.

06:10.149 --> 06:11.555
Baxter, clean that shit up!

06:11.561 --> 06:12.761
- Get a fucking mop!
- You all right, Liz?

06:12.767 --> 06:14.634
- Nah, that old bitch ran into me!
- Do it before I slot!

06:15.954 --> 06:17.981
You heard Mr Jackson, Baxter, move it.

06:17.987 --> 06:19.372
- For fuck's sake!
- You all right?

06:19.378 --> 06:21.880
- Yeah, I... I just burnt my hand on the...
- Oh, don't worry,

06:21.886 --> 06:25.154
I'll look after Liz. Come on,
come with me, Liz. Be fine.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.360
Hey.

06:31.582 --> 06:33.408
Well, that was clumsy.

06:33.679 --> 06:35.690
I did like you asked.

06:36.078 --> 06:38.331
I've got the detective coming in today.

06:38.778 --> 06:40.878
I told her I wanted to
make a new statement.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.285
I still don't see how she'll buy it.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.199
Then just stick to what we discussed.

06:44.205 --> 06:47.504
Don Kaplan seduced you into
making a false statement.

06:47.510 --> 06:50.707
- It's the truth. No buts, Liz!
- Yeah, but I... Ow!

06:50.713 --> 06:52.479
- Sonia?!
- Sorry.

06:54.973 --> 06:58.489
I've already perjured myself.
Why would they believe me now?

06:58.495 --> 06:59.880
Mea culpa.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.267
Latin.

07:01.466 --> 07:03.655
An admission of wrongdoing.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.028
You are confessing to
your part in a crime.

07:08.043 --> 07:10.460
- My part?
- A conspiracy...

07:10.561 --> 07:12.358
created by Don.

07:12.788 --> 07:16.536
We are both victims
of a manipulator, Liz.

07:16.719 --> 07:18.218
We are victims.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.578
Okay, come on.

07:41.099 --> 07:42.526
Home, sweet home.

07:45.218 --> 07:46.418
Okay.

07:47.061 --> 07:48.999
Hm, take a couple of

07:54.272 --> 07:56.759
I'm gonna have to have a look. Okay?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.027
Okay.

07:59.172 --> 08:00.372
Okay.

08:01.071 --> 08:03.715
Um... I think it's still in there.

08:04.352 --> 08:05.602
Oh, baby.

08:07.157 --> 08:08.466
Mmm.

08:08.861 --> 08:11.203
We need sterile bandages, and this...

08:11.209 --> 08:13.713
We need antibiotics, and stop
infection...

08:14.193 --> 08:16.052
- You've lost a lot of blood, honey.
- Mm-hmm.

08:16.058 --> 08:18.865
- Probably need a blood transfusion.
- I'm fine.

08:19.154 --> 08:21.782
You're not fine, Franky,
I'm out of my depth.

08:22.146 --> 08:24.104
I don't know what to do, honey.

08:25.284 --> 08:28.263
- You need a hospital.
- Gidge, no fuckin' hospital!

08:29.841 --> 08:32.187
I'd rather die that go back inside.

08:37.592 --> 08:39.601
_

08:39.662 --> 08:41.136
Attention, compound.

08:41.143 --> 08:42.591
Prisoners can now make their way
- _

08:42.597 --> 08:44.197
to the Visitors Centre.

08:54.113 --> 08:56.222
Supposed to be my day off, Liz.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.162
I hope this is worth it.

09:06.109 --> 09:08.227
I just wanted to tell
you you were right.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.126
I did collude when I made
that false statement...

09:11.132 --> 09:14.034
If you think a confession now
is going to mitigate your perjury

09:14.040 --> 09:16.042
- charge...
- ...but it wasn't with Sonia Stevens.

09:17.805 --> 09:20.129
I colluded with Detective Kaplan.

09:21.745 --> 09:22.945
He...

09:24.835 --> 09:26.059
well he...

09:26.065 --> 09:27.919
he seduced me.

09:29.630 --> 09:30.830
Yeah.

09:31.738 --> 09:36.468
He used me as part of his
scheme to blackmail Sonia.

09:38.540 --> 09:39.740
So...

09:40.421 --> 09:41.960
now you know the truth.

09:43.131 --> 09:45.108
Well, they offered us a
bout in the Philippines.

09:45.114 --> 09:47.531
The Philippines? Are you for real?

09:47.537 --> 09:50.435
- Well, set it up for when I get out.
- No, I already passed on that fight.

09:50.441 --> 09:51.959
So, call them back!

09:51.965 --> 09:54.692
- Tell the promoter fellow we're good to go.
- Rubes, you're forgettin'.

09:54.698 --> 09:55.986
Oi, Eddie...

09:56.278 --> 09:59.788
This fight will give
me a shot at going pro.

09:59.794 --> 10:02.437
Trip to Manilla's gonna cost 20 large.

10:02.669 --> 10:03.903
I'll get the money.

10:04.076 --> 10:05.905
Oh, yeah. How you gonna do that?

10:06.869 --> 10:08.069
Come here.

10:09.296 --> 10:10.702
Let's just say...

10:10.708 --> 10:13.210
I've got an opportunity in
here to make some fast cash.

10:13.216 --> 10:15.772
- Oh, shit!
- No, it's not gear, Eddie.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.579
I'll make the 20k.

10:17.669 --> 10:20.058
You just do your bloody
job and set up the fight.

10:21.757 --> 10:22.957
All right?

10:25.443 --> 10:26.779
Yeah!

10:29.664 --> 10:30.864
How'd it go?

10:30.870 --> 10:33.953
Hopeless. She said I had no
credibility with the court.

10:34.115 --> 10:35.785
Well, of course you don't.

10:35.791 --> 10:38.764
Which is why I told you to
emphasise your own culpability.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.186
Mea culpa, Liz!

10:40.192 --> 10:43.498
- I tried to "mea bloody culpa"!
- Obviously not hard enough.

10:43.504 --> 10:45.483
- Look, I did my best!
- Liz...

10:45.489 --> 10:49.867
if you are of no use to me
then what is the point of you?

10:51.153 --> 10:54.655
I think I've shown you, Sonia,
I am not to be underestimated.

10:54.661 --> 10:57.163
Well, that's just the thing, you
see, you've shown me your hand.

10:57.169 --> 11:00.765
- And you've shown me yours.
- Mine's not trembling.

11:05.929 --> 11:07.959
Fuck you!

11:08.748 --> 11:10.034
Fuck!

11:11.570 --> 11:13.053
- Police have cordoned off a scene
- _

11:13.059 --> 11:15.443
at an Altona Service
Station this morning

11:15.449 --> 11:18.750
where we understand that Doyle
was believed to have received

11:18.756 --> 11:21.102
some help from an unidentified
female accomplice.

11:21.108 --> 11:22.308
Police haven't...

11:28.789 --> 11:30.270
Got Stevens here to see you.

11:31.249 --> 11:32.870
Any developments on Gilmore?

11:33.952 --> 11:35.846
Police are waiting on the autopsy.

11:35.852 --> 11:37.467
None of the prisoners are talking.

11:38.052 --> 11:39.335
I heard the news on Doyle.

11:39.341 --> 11:41.350
Just cut the television
feed to all units.

11:41.356 --> 11:43.346
I don't want the women distracted by it.

11:47.444 --> 11:48.866
What is it Stevens?

11:50.432 --> 11:52.164
Are you all right, Governor?

11:52.170 --> 11:54.468
- You're looking a little ragged.
- What do you want.

11:54.474 --> 11:58.452
I want you to reopen the workshop
and resume my Green Wall project.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.671
I am dealing with two
escapees still at large

12:00.677 --> 12:02.072
and a murder investigation.

12:02.078 --> 12:04.894
Which is why you need a good news story.

12:05.074 --> 12:07.665
Let my Green Wall project be the

12:07.671 --> 12:11.988
shining beacon of prison re-eduction
it was always intended to be.

12:11.994 --> 12:14.184
As opposed to a handy escape route.

12:14.190 --> 12:17.330
Do you think you're
really up to the task?

12:17.729 --> 12:20.424
Given your recent suicide attempt.

12:20.915 --> 12:22.654
It's just the medicine I need.

12:24.312 --> 12:25.924
Mr Stewart!

12:27.787 --> 12:29.336
Get Stevens out of here.

12:29.391 --> 12:33.301
- Well, you're not even prepared to canvas the idea?
- I will canvas it when pigs fly.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.628
This isn't over.

12:35.634 --> 12:36.834
It is.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.835
The net is tightening on
Wentworth's two notorious escapees,

12:39.841 --> 12:42.864
Francesca Doyle and Joan
Ferguson. Police are confi...

12:43.400 --> 12:44.604
- Oi! Oi, what happened?!
- Oh, ah.

12:44.610 --> 12:45.922
- What the fuck!
- What the hell happened?

12:46.043 --> 12:48.124
- Kosta in?
- What did you do, Juice?

12:48.130 --> 12:51.049
- Can't tell, there's no tongue left.
- Oh, come on with the telly!

12:51.305 --> 12:52.505
Shit!

12:52.511 --> 12:54.683
Told you to tell me when
someone comes into the unit!

12:54.777 --> 12:57.202
I dunno, bang a fuckin'
pot or something.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.793
Tongueless sack of crap.

12:58.799 --> 13:00.082
- _
- What'd you do that for?!

13:01.486 --> 13:02.763
What d'ya want, golly?

13:02.769 --> 13:03.969
Come on with the telly!

13:03.975 --> 13:05.175
I want in.

13:05.181 --> 13:07.463
In to what, my hot little pants?

13:07.583 --> 13:08.783
You wish.

13:08.890 --> 13:10.090
Fight Club.

13:10.669 --> 13:12.625
- I wanna fight.
- Okay.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.478
- So, you're in.
- I come with conditions though.

13:16.484 --> 13:19.484
No kicking, no hair pulling.
If you want me to fight...

13:19.490 --> 13:21.500
we do with with gloves and proper rules.

13:21.617 --> 13:23.632
And if you call me "golly" again...

13:24.008 --> 13:26.649
I'll rip your fuckin' head off!

13:27.007 --> 13:28.207
Sure.

13:28.319 --> 13:30.531
- Whatever.
- I want an extra cut...

13:30.537 --> 13:32.281
what you make off my fights.

13:32.682 --> 13:33.882
25 percent.

13:35.485 --> 13:36.685
Screw you.

13:36.691 --> 13:37.891
See ya later then.

13:38.308 --> 13:39.721
15 percent.

13:41.277 --> 13:42.477
20.

13:42.767 --> 13:44.856
You fight who I say when I say.

13:44.862 --> 13:46.062
Sure.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.496
Get Spike. We're gonna
make a fuckin' killing.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.083
Okay, I accept.

14:18.873 --> 14:20.073
What?

14:20.357 --> 14:22.646
Ah, that you're sorry for what you did.

14:24.011 --> 14:25.474
That wasn't an apology.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.080
What?

14:29.169 --> 14:30.369
I'm gonna fight...

14:32.591 --> 14:34.055
in Kosta's Fight Club.

14:34.283 --> 14:35.665
You serious?!

14:35.869 --> 14:38.191
You can't trust Kosta, she used you.

14:38.197 --> 14:39.783
Now I'm gonna use her.

14:41.267 --> 14:44.202
Should you even be fighting...
with your condition?

14:44.470 --> 14:45.670
Oh, Allie...

14:45.860 --> 14:47.976
I've been doin' this for years.

14:51.087 --> 14:52.287
What?

14:52.293 --> 14:53.884
Are you gonna hold the bag or what?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.790
Come on, you skinny little bitch.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.772
Oh!

15:09.585 --> 15:12.615
Baby, this is crazy. You
gotta give yourself up.

15:13.002 --> 15:14.291
It's not happenin'.

15:19.830 --> 15:22.725
Aiding a fugitive, at least
we'll be inside together.

15:24.233 --> 15:25.863
They'd eat you alive in there.

15:26.355 --> 15:27.555
Please.

15:27.911 --> 15:30.952
I'd use my psychological insight to...

15:30.958 --> 15:33.977
exploit their weaknesses
and become Top Dog.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.865
I've had the best time with you, Gidge.

15:42.514 --> 15:44.322
Don't you dare.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.752
Don't you dare give up on me.

15:53.532 --> 15:56.633
- I'm calling an ambulance, baby.
- No... fuck!

15:56.639 --> 15:57.938
Well, at least let me go.

15:57.944 --> 16:00.219
I've got some heavier meds
at home and some antibiotics

16:00.225 --> 16:02.040
I'll be... I'll be
straight back. I promise.

16:02.046 --> 16:03.246
Don't go.

16:04.571 --> 16:06.094
Just stay with me.

16:11.317 --> 16:12.517
Mmm.

16:12.802 --> 16:14.002
Ah.

16:20.107 --> 16:21.307
Fuck!

16:26.996 --> 16:28.196
Gidge?

16:28.761 --> 16:29.961
Bridget?!

16:34.658 --> 16:35.858
Gidge?

16:41.831 --> 16:43.448
Oh, shit!

16:50.358 --> 16:51.558
Oh, fuck!

16:51.655 --> 16:53.094
Fuck!

16:55.747 --> 16:57.492
Get away from the window!

16:57.657 --> 16:58.951
Gidge!

16:59.758 --> 17:02.063
- We'd you go?
- Home.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.986
Did they follow you?

17:06.414 --> 17:07.614
Fuck!

17:09.815 --> 17:11.487
Oh, he's gone!

17:12.204 --> 17:15.204
Oh! Oh, fuck!

17:16.987 --> 17:18.686
It's okay. Good girl.

17:29.143 --> 17:30.583
You're beautiful.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.084
You wanna know something, Gidge?

17:38.318 --> 17:39.518
Mmm.

17:39.731 --> 17:42.669
Hated your guts the first time we met.

17:43.918 --> 17:46.544
I thought you were such a nosey cow.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.778
And you were pushy.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.837
Mm, you needed to be pushed...

17:52.448 --> 17:53.971
and prodded.

17:55.232 --> 17:57.347
But by our second session...

17:57.947 --> 17:59.147
Mmm.

18:01.141 --> 18:03.142
I just wanted to get into your pants.

18:14.211 --> 18:16.837
You know the very first
time I fell in love with you?

18:19.501 --> 18:21.205
"Paint me a picture."

18:23.087 --> 18:24.392
Hot girl...

18:25.252 --> 18:27.063
in a hot car.

18:32.953 --> 18:34.677
No matter what...

18:34.864 --> 18:36.678
we're in this together.

18:37.662 --> 18:38.862
Okay?

18:40.092 --> 18:41.292
Mm.

18:43.488 --> 18:44.688
Mm.

18:46.672 --> 18:47.872
Hm?

18:48.657 --> 18:49.857
Mm.

18:54.780 --> 18:56.956
Attention, compound.
Attention compound.

18:56.962 --> 18:59.499
H Block are now called to breakfast.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.966
Saw you and Ruby in the gym
yesterday. Good to see ya connecting.

19:03.972 --> 19:05.552
Yeah, well, I held the bag

19:05.558 --> 19:07.248
and she punched the
living shit out of it.

19:07.254 --> 19:08.454
Good connection all right.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.817
Yeah, she's got pretty good form

19:09.823 --> 19:12.055
but her combinations
could use some work.

19:12.353 --> 19:15.376
I used to box. It helped to keep
me on the straight and narrow.

19:16.093 --> 19:17.454
That worked out well for ya.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.477
Ah, it's good to see
Ru training, you know...

19:20.483 --> 19:23.156
keeps the mind sharp
and soothes the soul.

19:23.251 --> 19:24.743
What, getting punched in the face?

19:24.749 --> 19:28.090
No... I'm talking about the
art, the mentality of the sport.

19:28.096 --> 19:29.802
You know, the discipline of training.

19:29.808 --> 19:32.308
Combine that with heart
and there's this...

19:32.417 --> 19:35.398
I dunno... this, um, spiritual purity.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.577
Hey, um...

19:41.057 --> 19:44.092
there's nothing pure about the
kind of fighting she's training for.

19:45.386 --> 19:47.673
- Yeah, what d'you want?
- Whoa, hello.

19:48.659 --> 19:50.071
Take a seat, why don't ya.

19:50.347 --> 19:51.948
I need to talk to you.

19:53.034 --> 19:55.559
- Eat it. Eat it. Eat it.
- Lick it.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.446
Hey! Hey! What the
fuck?! Get the fuck off!

20:00.178 --> 20:04.687
You're gonna stop this Fight
Club right now, aren't you Kosta?!

20:05.338 --> 20:06.914
Don't think so.

20:07.588 --> 20:09.869
You know what happened to the
last person who crossed me?

20:11.081 --> 20:13.034
You stitched the wrong golly's hand.

20:13.341 --> 20:15.245
Yeah, Spike told me you
really fucked her up.

20:15.251 --> 20:16.817
Wasn't that Connors bitch.

20:16.823 --> 20:18.023
It was Ruby.

20:19.032 --> 20:21.968
Your punishment thing's a wank.
You don't have the nuts for it.

20:23.364 --> 20:26.686
Try and stop Fight Club,
I shoot my mouth off.

20:36.724 --> 20:38.015
Did you lie to me?

20:38.521 --> 20:40.447
Was it you who bashed Spike?

20:41.219 --> 20:42.771
Or was that Ruby?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.229
Why did you cover for her?

20:47.682 --> 20:51.182
Kid on a short sentence,
figured she deserved a break.

20:54.693 --> 20:57.089
That is just fucking great!

21:09.230 --> 21:10.430
Ah!

21:12.028 --> 21:13.356
How you feeling?

21:14.988 --> 21:16.371
Like I've been shot.

21:16.377 --> 21:17.689
Got this out of your backpack.

21:17.695 --> 21:21.112
Mm. It's from Iman's flat. It's
just all her mail, I grabbed it.

21:21.118 --> 21:22.318
You gone through it?

21:23.006 --> 21:25.826
- Yeah, it's mostly junk.
- You seen this?

21:26.510 --> 21:28.008
It's her credit card...?

21:28.196 --> 21:31.286
LUG here... and here.

21:31.503 --> 21:32.987
Monthly debit.

21:33.696 --> 21:34.896
So?

21:36.134 --> 21:37.698
LUG.

21:37.704 --> 21:39.373
- Lock-up garage.
- _

21:40.188 --> 21:42.001
Iman had a lock-up garage?

21:42.212 --> 21:45.132
She has a lock-up garage.

21:56.303 --> 21:57.905
Stand there, Gidge.

22:08.857 --> 22:10.560
Ooh, fuck!

22:13.602 --> 22:14.875
I can't do it.

22:15.438 --> 22:17.367
Only way we're gettin'
in here's with a key.

22:17.373 --> 22:18.683
Where's the key?

22:19.086 --> 22:20.363
It has to be in the flat.

22:20.369 --> 22:23.132
Nah, pulled the place apart.
I searched every bloody inch.

22:23.138 --> 22:24.653
It'd be with her stuff.

22:24.659 --> 22:27.228
When she arrived at prison,
to be returned on release.

22:27.234 --> 22:28.559
It'd be in the box.

22:28.565 --> 22:30.348
What, so everything's
still at Wentworth?

22:32.237 --> 22:34.229
So I just need to break back in there.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.180
So, what are ya gonna do?

22:38.497 --> 22:41.185
Well, if I shut down Kosta's
Fight Club, she'll gonna blab.

22:41.191 --> 22:42.962
And then I'm gonna have to
fuckin' stitch Ruby's hand.

22:42.968 --> 22:45.919
Oh, so what. If you don't
do it you'll look piss-weak.

22:45.925 --> 22:47.972
Can you tell me something
I don't know, Einstein.

22:48.245 --> 22:49.575
Oh, mate.

22:56.646 --> 22:59.297
- Oh, hey!
- Mr J, is there any news on Franky?

22:59.303 --> 23:00.771
Yeah, thanks for shutting the TVs off.

23:00.777 --> 23:02.683
Um, that was, uh, the
Governor's decision.

23:02.689 --> 23:05.166
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, but w-what about Franky?
- There's no news, Jenkins.

23:05.172 --> 23:07.990
- Oh, well, s-so they haven't found her yet?
- Isn't that what I just said?!

23:07.996 --> 23:10.199
Yeah, okay, keep your skirt on. Fuck!

23:10.597 --> 23:12.912
Well, at least we know
she's still going, right?

23:12.918 --> 23:15.107
Mr Jackson, quick word, please.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.030
Okay, if this is about Doyle, there, um,

23:25.036 --> 23:27.457
- well, Th-there's, we've got nothing.
- What's going on with you?

23:29.121 --> 23:31.070
- Are you okay?
- What do you want, Kaz?

23:31.307 --> 23:32.540
Listen...

23:33.328 --> 23:36.614
Whatever you did, you
did to protect the women.

23:36.620 --> 23:39.331
You did... what had to be done.

23:39.735 --> 23:42.548
You are a good man...

23:42.554 --> 23:44.856
and I need for you to remember that.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.330
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

23:47.336 --> 23:49.663
Phones are not available for use.

23:53.983 --> 23:56.295
Your Fight Club... finished.

23:56.301 --> 24:00.420
Ignore that, I guarantee,
you will be fucked!

24:01.670 --> 24:03.599
She'll be right. She'll be fine.

24:03.605 --> 24:05.542
Uh, Susan, er, just, uh, find yourself

24:05.548 --> 24:08.319
something nice to do here for
a second. I need to talk to Liz.

24:08.479 --> 24:10.779
- Why?
- You trust me don't you?

24:10.785 --> 24:11.985
Yeah.

24:11.991 --> 24:15.825
Well, Liz is instrumental
in reopening our workshop.

24:16.397 --> 24:17.597
How?

24:17.603 --> 24:19.294
I thought you just said you trusted me?

24:19.300 --> 24:22.014
- Yeah.
- Well then why aren't I feeling it?

24:22.397 --> 24:26.138
- Uh, oh, whatever.
- Mm-hm, whatever, mmm.

24:30.601 --> 24:31.801
_

24:31.813 --> 24:33.171
Morning, Lucy.

24:33.177 --> 24:35.507
How's mute working for you today?

24:38.706 --> 24:40.085
Ah!

24:40.091 --> 24:42.846
I just had an excellent
meeting with Anna.

24:42.852 --> 24:45.360
- Who's Anna?
- My PR woman, keep up, Liz.

24:45.366 --> 24:47.556
- Oh, God, right.
- So...

24:47.562 --> 24:49.862
the campaign is proceeding beautifully.

24:49.868 --> 24:52.931
With your help we are
exposing Don Kaplan as corrupt.

24:52.937 --> 24:55.448
- Yeah, but cops don't believe me, Sonia.
- And that's just part one.

24:55.454 --> 24:59.284
Simultaneously we are
launching a PR blitz.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.770
Portraying me as a
powerful force for good,

25:01.874 --> 25:04.356
striving to create positive change

25:04.357 --> 25:07.566
in the lives of women with whom
I don't belong, etc, etc, etc...

25:07.572 --> 25:11.291
But... to do that, I need
the Green Wall up and running.

25:11.297 --> 25:13.393
Oh, well, good luck with that.

25:14.198 --> 25:16.604
Never underestimate my reach, Liz.

25:17.688 --> 25:20.771
You can not be seriously
considering that?!

25:22.658 --> 25:25.643
Two prisoners just escaped
from it, for God's sake.

25:27.439 --> 25:28.639
I'm...

25:28.645 --> 25:31.709
I have to go. We can talk
about this tomorrow. Okay, bye.

25:32.121 --> 25:34.739
- I can come back if...
- No, no, no. No, it is the...

25:34.926 --> 25:36.932
usual bureaucracy.

25:36.938 --> 25:38.138
Come in.

25:40.411 --> 25:41.611
How are you?

25:43.788 --> 25:46.298
Well, pretty crap, actually.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.214
Tea?

25:49.319 --> 25:51.014
You read my mind.

25:51.622 --> 25:54.020
- Pot of tea in here, please.
- Yes, Governor.

25:54.911 --> 25:56.123
Come in, take a seat.

25:56.129 --> 25:58.015
In the news this morning...

25:59.537 --> 26:02.233
there was mention of
a female accomplice.

26:02.678 --> 26:05.810
The suggestion was it was
Joan Ferguson helping Franky,

26:05.816 --> 26:07.958
but we both know how unlikely that is.

26:12.576 --> 26:14.778
Yeah, I haven't heard from Franky.

26:17.580 --> 26:21.975
I mean, I'm... obviously
very worried about her, but...

26:22.086 --> 26:23.286
no.

26:24.175 --> 26:25.375
Ta.

26:29.270 --> 26:30.731
- Oh, shit!
- Oh!

26:30.737 --> 26:33.688
- No, it's okay! No worries. It's okay. It's okay
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.

26:33.694 --> 26:34.991
Your carpet.

26:34.997 --> 26:37.091
Hey, can we, ah, have
a tea towel in here.

26:37.097 --> 26:39.159
- I'm such a klutz!
- It's an accident.

26:39.165 --> 26:42.454
Just, don't worry I'll... I can
just pour you another cup of tea.

26:42.648 --> 26:45.050
Oh, damn, Vera, I can't believe this,

26:45.056 --> 26:46.340
- I have completely forgotten,
- Here you go.

26:46.346 --> 26:48.740
- I've got a 2 o'clock. I've gotta go. I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

26:48.746 --> 26:50.849
- Yeah, no, of course.
- Look, I'll call you tomorrow

26:50.855 --> 26:52.410
- and we'll have a chat then, all right?
- Okay,

26:52.416 --> 26:53.699
- Sure.
- Sorry.

27:27.670 --> 27:29.472
- Iman Farah.
- Oh, shit!

27:30.023 --> 27:31.652
- Oh, Vera.
- You lied to me.

27:31.658 --> 27:34.046
- Just listen to me, please.
- You have been helping Franky.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.626
Yes, because she's innocent.
I know she's innocent.

27:36.632 --> 27:38.704
- You will go to prison.
- I don't care!

27:38.710 --> 27:39.977
I care!

27:39.983 --> 27:42.187
She needs my help, Vera, please, just...

27:42.193 --> 27:44.889
- Oh, Bridget! You can not cross this line!
- I'm not gonna turn my back on her. I...

27:44.895 --> 27:46.811
I've fucking crossed it!

27:47.491 --> 27:49.296
I've crossed it!

27:51.504 --> 27:53.196
You expect me to cross it with you?

27:55.190 --> 27:57.658
Vera... please.

27:59.299 --> 28:00.499
Give me that.

28:00.505 --> 28:04.084
- Vera... Vera, please!
- Bridget, for you sake,

28:04.090 --> 28:05.569
that is not leaving this prison.

28:13.496 --> 28:15.045
What are you gonna do?

28:18.149 --> 28:19.349
Just go.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.846
_

28:55.958 --> 28:57.878
- Hands where we can see them!
- That's her.

28:59.129 --> 29:02.160
Wilson, Characters,
Anderson, check the fence.

29:03.333 --> 29:04.904
- Nothing under here!
- Fuck!

29:04.910 --> 29:06.820
- All clear!
- No one here!

29:07.121 --> 29:08.321
Fence is clear!

29:09.113 --> 29:11.507
- _
- We found this in the rail car.

29:12.719 --> 29:14.734
Antibiotics. Your name on 'em.

29:15.656 --> 29:18.443
We also found bloodied
clothes and bandages,

29:18.449 --> 29:20.972
a mobile phone, and a
whole collection of mail...

29:21.055 --> 29:22.868
from Iman Farah's address.

29:23.368 --> 29:24.774
Why'd she go there?

29:26.086 --> 29:27.436
What was she looking for?

29:28.697 --> 29:30.533
Where is she now, Ms Westfall? Come on.

29:30.897 --> 29:32.506
Franky needs a doctor.

29:32.695 --> 29:36.056
If you really wanna help her,
and it's obvious you do...

29:36.062 --> 29:37.478
tell us where she is.

29:38.955 --> 29:40.845
Aid and abet.

29:40.939 --> 29:42.889
That could get you ten years.

29:43.370 --> 29:46.853
But you cooperate now and I
can make that charge go away.

29:47.514 --> 29:48.714
It's your choice.

29:52.532 --> 29:53.732
It's no choice.

29:55.993 --> 29:57.500
You'll have to charge me.

30:01.915 --> 30:04.035
What's goin' on with the telly?!

30:04.041 --> 30:05.241
- Governor.
- _

30:05.247 --> 30:07.017
Oi, you can't take it away!

30:07.023 --> 30:08.355
Oh, Stevens...

30:09.910 --> 30:14.047
I don't know what strings you
managed to pull so quickly...

30:14.414 --> 30:17.335
but I've just had the Chairman
of the Prison Board on the phone,

30:17.341 --> 30:20.640
demanding that I reinstate
your Green Wall project.

30:20.646 --> 30:23.855
I told him, given everything, I
thought it was a disastrous move.

30:23.861 --> 30:25.871
That's why we have boards.

30:25.877 --> 30:27.743
You know, they're able to
take a more balanced view

30:27.749 --> 30:31.162
when they're not overwhelmed
by day-to-day management.

30:32.988 --> 30:35.481
Well, the board was split evenly.

30:35.669 --> 30:38.602
- Which means?
- That I had the deciding vote.

30:38.979 --> 30:40.989
Don't ever think you
can go over my head.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.110
Remember what you are, Stevens.

30:44.637 --> 30:45.837
A prisoner.

30:46.348 --> 30:47.548
Nothing more.

30:51.411 --> 30:53.348
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

30:53.354 --> 30:55.534
The canteen is now open for H Block.

30:57.232 --> 30:58.552
What are you doing?

30:58.558 --> 31:00.973
Well, ah, what does it look like?

31:01.370 --> 31:04.139
- Uh, I thought that Kosta got warned off Fight Club.
- Yeah...

31:04.145 --> 31:06.373
someone dogged to Kaz but...

31:07.276 --> 31:09.351
Kosta doesn't give a
shit about that, 'ey.

31:09.357 --> 31:10.557
Ruby, I...

31:10.563 --> 31:11.763
Allie...

31:12.416 --> 31:14.642
- I need this fight.
- Why?

31:15.242 --> 31:19.159
I have an opportunity to go overseas
and become a professional fighter,

31:19.234 --> 31:22.050
and I need money to make that happen.

31:24.062 --> 31:25.262
Allie...

31:25.960 --> 31:28.283
I've wanted this my whole life.

31:34.174 --> 31:36.646
Anyway, um...

31:37.432 --> 31:40.370
are you gonna help me
wrap my hands or not?

31:40.943 --> 31:42.143
Come on.

31:45.154 --> 31:48.547
- Fine. Oh, my God.
- Come here.

31:50.974 --> 31:52.174
That's it.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.644
- It's just round the thumb.
- Mm-hmm.

32:04.168 --> 32:05.588
You're free to go.

32:06.941 --> 32:08.930
- What that's it?
- For now.

32:09.949 --> 32:12.048
One of my officers drove your car here.

32:12.253 --> 32:13.754
Uh, thank you very much.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.087
Two cars on her.

32:24.517 --> 32:27.509
Iman Farah's mail. Do you
want us to go through it?

32:27.983 --> 32:29.603
Doyle took it for a reason.

32:42.613 --> 32:44.041
_

33:00.879 --> 33:02.079
_

33:13.926 --> 33:15.957
- Oh, Susan!
- Hello.

33:16.715 --> 33:18.010
What are you doing?

33:18.016 --> 33:20.924
Um... lookin' for me cash, 'ey.

33:21.543 --> 33:22.973
F.....uck it!

33:23.215 --> 33:25.025
What do you need money for?

33:25.031 --> 33:26.231
To bet.

33:26.303 --> 33:28.277
To, um... can I bum a 20 off ya?

33:28.283 --> 33:29.983
Oh, no, fuck it, no, Kosta
knows I'm good for it.

33:29.989 --> 33:31.311
What are you talking about?!

33:31.317 --> 33:32.817
Actually, where is everybody?

33:32.823 --> 33:36.030
Everyone's at the Fight Club. Come,
we gotta get to... to the workshop.

33:36.122 --> 33:37.322
My workshop?

33:37.328 --> 33:38.528
Mm.

33:38.708 --> 33:40.784
They're fighting in my workshop?!

33:40.790 --> 33:41.990
All right.

33:43.477 --> 33:44.797
15?! Jesus.

33:44.803 --> 33:47.201
- I'm gonna put 200 on Bluey.
- 500 on Mitchell, three to one.

33:47.207 --> 33:48.485
200 on Baxter.

33:49.294 --> 33:50.778
We agreed on Ruby.

33:50.784 --> 33:52.243
You're fighting Spike?!

33:52.967 --> 33:54.239
Piece of piss.

33:55.910 --> 33:57.731
No more bets!

33:57.737 --> 34:00.426
- No more bets!
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:00.432 --> 34:03.044
- No, no, no, one more. One more, come on.
- Well, where's your money?

34:03.050 --> 34:04.734
Oh, you know I'm good for it. Come on.

34:05.028 --> 34:07.637
- 20 bucks on Ruby. Yeah?
- All right. Put her down.

34:07.643 --> 34:09.190
- Fight this fight! Come on, fight!
- Be careful.

34:09.197 --> 34:10.643
Fight! Fight! Fight!

34:10.650 --> 34:13.246
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

34:13.253 --> 34:16.210
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

34:16.217 --> 34:20.167
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Quiet!

34:21.284 --> 34:22.484
Fight!

34:24.911 --> 34:26.112
C'arn, Ruby!

34:30.389 --> 34:31.723
C'arn, Ruby!

34:32.750 --> 34:34.196
Flash me!

34:34.281 --> 34:35.821
- Argh!
- Again!

34:35.952 --> 34:37.369
Oh, come on!

34:39.164 --> 34:41.360
Get in there! Get her!

34:43.100 --> 34:45.735
Come on, Tweety-pie,
you need a hand there?

34:46.473 --> 34:47.672
Argh!

34:50.695 --> 34:52.525
Ugh! Ugh!

34:56.556 --> 34:57.760
Fight!

34:57.766 --> 34:59.048
Come on, get up!

34:59.530 --> 35:01.158
Get up!

35:01.447 --> 35:04.084
Stop... this... fight!

35:06.055 --> 35:08.287
- I said stop it!
- Ruby!

35:08.414 --> 35:09.614
Argh!

35:09.995 --> 35:11.202
Oh, fuck!

35:11.208 --> 35:13.100
- Fuck!
- Yeah!

35:14.694 --> 35:16.094
- Oh, f...!
- Objection!

35:20.847 --> 35:22.047
Stop!

35:22.618 --> 35:23.818
Ugh!

35:25.111 --> 35:26.961
Stop the fight!

35:26.967 --> 35:28.967
- Get up!
- You gotta stop this fight!

35:28.973 --> 35:30.173
I can't now.

35:33.952 --> 35:35.352
Fuck, yeah!

35:47.319 --> 35:48.519
Argh!

35:49.908 --> 35:51.108
- Fight!
- Argh!

35:55.386 --> 35:58.497
Sucked in, yeah!

36:01.286 --> 36:04.566
Ruby?! Ruby, are you okay?!

36:10.917 --> 36:12.540
Okay, let's get out of here.

36:16.666 --> 36:18.182
I warned you, Kosta.

36:18.251 --> 36:20.478
What are you gonna do, fight me here?

36:21.054 --> 36:22.964
No, you wanna challenge me...

36:23.471 --> 36:25.561
in the laundry, after work unit...

36:25.666 --> 36:27.113
you bring a shiv.

36:55.908 --> 36:57.120
Argh-ah!

37:19.213 --> 37:20.414
Doyle?!

37:20.885 --> 37:23.119
I need you to come out of the garage!

37:25.125 --> 37:27.931
It's over, Doyle! Don't make
this harder than it has to be!

37:29.508 --> 37:31.422
This is your last chance to come out!

37:33.800 --> 37:35.000
Doyle?!

37:35.095 --> 37:36.311
Time's up!

37:36.317 --> 37:38.118
Don't come in 'ere!

37:38.124 --> 37:39.824
I've got a gun!

37:39.830 --> 37:41.030
Yeah, she's bluffing.

37:43.798 --> 37:45.225
I say we go in, Wade.

37:45.231 --> 37:46.633
Come on, give it to me.

37:47.024 --> 37:48.224
Give it to me.

37:53.704 --> 37:54.904
Ready to move.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.000
Doyle?!

38:28.425 --> 38:30.128
Hands where we can see them!

38:33.734 --> 38:35.849
Don't move! Don't move!

38:36.701 --> 38:38.295
Hands where we can see them!

38:38.948 --> 38:42.155
Right-o, hands, hands!
Show me your hands!

38:46.289 --> 38:47.489
Doyle?!

38:53.100 --> 38:55.866
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

38:55.872 --> 38:58.502
- All women to report to assigned work duties.
- _

39:08.434 --> 39:11.620
- Now, this will be interesting.
- If we're lucky.

39:13.727 --> 39:14.927
Here we go.

39:16.534 --> 39:20.209
Hey... hey, Kosta! If you die I
still want that money you owe me.

39:20.215 --> 39:21.520
What's gonna happen here?

39:21.526 --> 39:25.312
They'll go each other with shivs,
the last one standing's Top Dog.

39:33.199 --> 39:34.399
Ugh!

39:37.258 --> 39:38.735
- Break it up!
- Everyone...

39:38.741 --> 39:40.644
- everyone back to your units, now!
- Stop the rough!

39:40.650 --> 39:41.850
Not doin' anything!

39:41.856 --> 39:43.464
- Drop it, Kosta! Drop it!
- Far out! Argh!

39:43.470 --> 39:44.670
Not doin' anything.

39:44.676 --> 39:46.762
Go or I'll throw you in
the slot with these two!

39:46.768 --> 39:48.886
Argh, you're fucking hurting me!

39:55.387 --> 39:56.876
I'm okay, I'm okay.

39:59.266 --> 40:02.789
Oh, shit! Ruby, you gotta go to medical.

40:03.070 --> 40:06.367
- No, Allie, I'm fine.
- Come on, you're pissing blood!

40:07.701 --> 40:08.901
Fuck!

40:09.576 --> 40:11.253
What the fuck do you want?!

40:11.259 --> 40:13.517
Her piss is full of blood
and she won't get help.

40:13.956 --> 40:15.156
Let me look.

40:16.645 --> 40:18.329
Let me look.

40:21.645 --> 40:23.177
Whoa!

40:23.463 --> 40:25.225
She had something in her gloves.

40:25.574 --> 40:27.338
Can you get me some ice, please?

40:30.526 --> 40:31.956
Oh, fuck!

40:32.661 --> 40:35.811
- Holy shit!
- All right. All right.

40:36.973 --> 40:38.899
What ya gonna do, lecture me, huh?

40:39.475 --> 40:41.477
Keep tryin' to protect me?

40:42.586 --> 40:46.105
No. I'm not going to protect you.

40:46.465 --> 40:48.426
I'm gonna teach you
to protect yourself.

40:48.963 --> 40:51.887
You're bobbin' and weavin' and
slippin' punches like Mayweather.

40:51.893 --> 40:54.135
We gotta fix that lousy
left jab of yours...

40:54.141 --> 40:55.549
'cause it sucks.

40:56.329 --> 40:57.932
Could be your greatest weapon.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.678
Lay down. Need to get ice on that.

41:08.755 --> 41:10.832
Get me the fuck out!

41:13.356 --> 41:14.913
Hello?!

41:15.311 --> 41:18.410
Can anybody fucking hear me?! Hey!

41:18.530 --> 41:20.320
Fuckin' fixed!

41:27.431 --> 41:28.828
Jesus!

41:29.017 --> 41:30.617
Hello?!

41:30.623 --> 41:32.568
Lagging to a screw, Kaz?

41:32.574 --> 41:34.269
What other choice do I have?

41:34.854 --> 41:37.175
Well, you know what will
happen if the women find out.

41:37.181 --> 41:38.381
Shh.

41:38.567 --> 41:40.670
It's the only way I can operate, Will.

41:41.076 --> 41:42.361
I've tried.

41:43.126 --> 41:45.521
Can't bash the women, I just can't.

41:48.016 --> 41:51.462
If lagging to you helps
us protect the women...

41:54.489 --> 41:56.137
let's keep doing it.

41:59.166 --> 42:00.366
All right.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.098
Thank you.

42:15.641 --> 42:16.965
Hey.

42:18.564 --> 42:19.860
Hey.

42:21.636 --> 42:23.361
I grassed.

42:23.917 --> 42:27.628
- I found it, Gidge. I found the shrine.
- I know.

42:28.105 --> 42:29.385
Shh.

42:32.441 --> 42:34.019
You did good, kid.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.381
You did good.

42:40.324 --> 42:43.262
Any idea as the the
whereabouts of Joan Ferguson?

42:43.761 --> 42:46.177
- No.
- Well, you two escaped together didn't you?

42:46.183 --> 42:49.068
No, first I heard about
it was in the papers.

42:49.425 --> 42:53.224
But I found a photo... there was
a fingerprint on it, it was blood.

42:53.230 --> 42:55.848
We've already established that
the print belonged to Iman Farah.

42:55.854 --> 42:57.538
The blood was a match for Mike Pennisi.

42:57.544 --> 43:00.455
So... it proves that
she's the killer, right?

43:00.461 --> 43:01.661
No.

43:02.038 --> 43:03.652
No, it's circumstantial.

43:07.048 --> 43:08.767
But we did find something else.

43:11.961 --> 43:13.619
We found a mobile phone.

43:13.791 --> 43:16.333
On it were photos that Farah had taken.

43:16.610 --> 43:19.151
All of Mike Pennisi... dead.

43:19.716 --> 43:22.349
It's obvious she took them
shortly after shooting him.

43:22.876 --> 43:25.497
Also... I spoke to Tina Mercado...

43:25.645 --> 43:26.965
she came clean.

43:26.971 --> 43:30.565
Admitted giving Ferguson a false
alibi over the death of Farah.

43:32.771 --> 43:34.270
Given all of that...

43:34.380 --> 43:37.171
I'm recommending the
dropping of all charges.

43:38.999 --> 43:41.530
<i>* Let me hear them all *</i>

43:58.340 --> 44:03.000

44:03.006 --> 44:07.553

44:14.918 --> 44:17.019

44:28.088 --> 44:31.197

44:31.203 --> 44:33.562

44:33.568 --> 44:36.766
- <i>* We'll make it happen *</i>
- Hey! What are you doin'? Don't worry.

44:36.772 --> 44:39.928
- You did it, lovely, hey? Good on you.
- Yeah.

44:39.934 --> 44:42.135
- <i>* Now we're standing here *</i>
- Yeah.

44:42.141 --> 44:44.551
<i>* The story of our lives *</i>

44:44.557 --> 44:46.260
- Sit down, sit down, sit down.
- How are ya?!

44:46.266 --> 44:49.792
- <i>* We faced all our fears *</i>
- Oh, thanks.

44:50.348 --> 44:53.625
<i>* Opened up the skies *</i>

44:53.631 --> 44:56.520
- I can't believe you're here.
- Well, you're not gettin' rid of me that easy.

44:56.526 --> 44:58.733
<i>* Now we walk as one *</i>

44:58.739 --> 45:01.893
<i>* We stood the test of time *</i>

45:02.446 --> 45:04.143
- I love you guys.
- Same.

45:04.149 --> 45:06.110
<i>* Then you let me in *</i>

45:07.050 --> 45:11.444
- <i>* The story begins *</i>
- Up, up, up.

45:11.847 --> 45:16.410
<i>* Because we grow, and we hold *</i>

45:16.416 --> 45:20.332
