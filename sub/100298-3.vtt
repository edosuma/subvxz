You asshole!

07:56.184 --> 07:57.977
Why am I an asshole?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.437
Why, because I
hooked up with a girl?

07:59.437 --> 08:00.522
A girl I saw first!

08:00.522 --> 08:02.148
What are you, six?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.651
‐You don't get
to call dibs here.
‐I hired her.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.444
I interviewed a lot of people
and she's the one I picked.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.405
Yeah. To work
at the restaurant.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.532
‐Not to be your girlfriend.
‐Well, that was the subtext.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.119
You know, last week
she told me I was incredible.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.123
You're a kid. Alright?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.959
‐You'd be dreaming if‐‐
‐So what if I am?!

08:22.377 --> 08:25.255
What's the harm
in letting me have that?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.924
Something to look forward
to seeing every time I go
to that restaurant

08:27.924 --> 08:30.510
instead of the giant hole
that <i>Mami</i> and <i>Papi</i> left.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.179
And I'm not entitled
to the same thing?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.014
You could have any girl!

08:36.850 --> 08:39.686
You pretty much have
had every girl.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.521
In the end, none of them
means anything to you.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.232
This one's not gonna
be any different.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.071
But she could have
meant something to me.

<i>Admit it!</i>

09:09.758 --> 09:11.468
You're worried now too.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.261
Eighteen hours.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.598
(sighs)
I'm trying to think of
every perfectly reasonable

09:16.598 --> 09:18.725
explanation why they
wouldn't have called us.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.061
I mean, maybe they didn't pay
their phone bill in time.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.520
Beto:
Hey you guys, check this.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.314
There's an earthquake
in Mexico yesterday.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.274

A big one?!

09:26.274 --> 09:27.817
‐Was anyone hurt?
‐No, doesn't say.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.528
Just says the epicenter was in
San Luis Potosi which is about

09:30.528 --> 09:34.282
a hundred miles north of them.
It hit at 9:43 a. m.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.493
Hit? Hit sounds really bad.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.369
<i>Papi</i> would have
already been on his way
to work by then, right?

09:38.369 --> 09:40.705
<i>Mami</i> would have been
at a job interview
or en route to one.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.083
What if her bus was
going over a bridge?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.667
Or under an overpass?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.128
‐(phone rings)
‐That's a Mexico number.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.005
I don't recognize it.
It's neither of theirs.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.091
It could be a hospital
or a neighbor

09:51.091 --> 09:53.134
or somebody who found
their bodies in rubble.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.136
‐Answer it, Bey.
‐Val: No, wait!

09:55.136 --> 09:56.971
We say prayers first.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.307
(ringing continues)

09:59.307 --> 10:00.934
All of us!

10:05.855 --> 10:07.440
‐Hello?
‐Put it on speaker.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.776
‐Gloria: <i>Beto?</i>
‐ <i>Mami?</i>

10:09.776 --> 10:11.820
You're okay? <i>Papi</i> too?

10:11.820 --> 10:13.738
Javier:
<i>Right here.</i>
<i>We're fine,</i> mijos.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.406
What happened? We heard
there was an earthquake.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.408
Gloria:
<i>But not so big. It's just...</i>

10:17.408 --> 10:19.160
<i>big enough to cause an outage,</i>

10:19.160 --> 10:21.204
<i>eh, what do</i>
<i>they call it, Javi?</i>

10:21.204 --> 10:22.747
‐Javier: <i>The grid went down.</i>
‐Gloria: <i>Mm‐hmm.</i>

10:22.747 --> 10:25.208
Javier:
<i>No phone service. No way</i>
<i>to charge our cells.</i>

10:25.208 --> 10:27.168
Gloria:
<i>But a nice policeman</i>
<i>who live in our building</i>

10:27.168 --> 10:29.379
<i>is letting us use</i>
<i>his special phone.</i>

10:29.379 --> 10:31.297
<i>(Gloria speaking Spanish)</i>

10:34.759 --> 10:37.137
<i>There's other people waiting</i>
<i>to talk to their families so...</i>

10:37.137 --> 10:39.055
We were so worried.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.266
‐I was the most worried.
‐Gloria: <i>I know,</i> mi amor.

10:41.266 --> 10:44.686
<i>But we're fine. And we'll</i>
<i>talk to you as soon</i>
<i>as we can. Okay?</i>

10:44.686 --> 10:45.937
(dial tone)

10:45.937 --> 10:46.771
(clears throat)

10:50.984 --> 10:51.776
Hey.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.195
Hey, Val.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.322
It's good news.

10:57.824 --> 11:01.161
I know, I just... need a minute.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.248
Hey, you talk
to your parents?

11:06.249 --> 11:08.042
Yeah, Bey got the sense that
they'd be back in touch

11:08.042 --> 11:09.544
in a day or two
once the grid is up.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.588
Javi's phone is workin'.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.214
He called me on my way
over to tell me

11:13.214 --> 11:15.175
what kind of <i>ceviche</i> to make

11:15.175 --> 11:17.552
with last night's
leftover tilapia.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.554
Hey man, what's
LMV Enterprises?

11:19.554 --> 11:21.848
That's Louie. Uncle Louie.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.933
‐Down the street.
‐We owe him money?

11:25.018 --> 11:25.977
We owe him...

11:27.270 --> 11:29.147
Holy shit!

11:29.147 --> 11:30.315
Is this right?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.567
‐A lot of money.
‐Our liquor license.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.110
It's in his name.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.404
How do you think your folks
manage to sell booze?

11:36.404 --> 11:40.158
You gotta have papers.
So he did them a solid
way back when.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.118
Yeah, but that was
16 years ago. Right?

11:42.118 --> 11:43.578
Wh‐What,
we're still paying him?

11:43.578 --> 11:46.122
Well the deal was
30% of the bar.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.957
In perpetuity?

11:47.957 --> 11:50.877
‐What's perpetuity?
‐Meaning we pay
him forever?

11:50.877 --> 11:53.630
Oh. Yeah. Perpetuity.

at St. Florentina.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.187
Dozens of people

12:52.355 --> 12:53.815
You're available to work
nights and weekends?

12:53.815 --> 12:55.024
He's available
all the time.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.194
I'm sorry, who's
being interviewed here?

13:01.656 --> 13:03.199
It's a minimum wage job.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.242
You alright with that?

13:04.242 --> 13:06.411
Yeah, that's fine.
That's good.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.747
Great. And I'm assuming you
fulfill the other requirement.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.626
Having a pulse.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.920
(nervous laughter)

13:15.920 --> 13:17.588
Great.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.048
You're hired!

13:19.048 --> 13:20.842
Just let me photocopy
your driver's license

13:20.842 --> 13:22.176

13:26.639 --> 13:28.224
I don't have
a driver's license.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.392
Any kind of

13:51.205 --> 13:52.832
my driver's test.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.751
I believe it.
You're very good.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.920
You know actually, Emilio
dated his driving instructor.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.257
‐He was, uh, 16. She was 24.
‐Mm‐hmm.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.134
Man.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.262
He liked to say the woman
really taught him how to merge.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.140
But, um, I guess you'd
probably know if that
was true or not, huh?

14:10.391 --> 14:11.350
(quietly):
Yeah.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.687
Is there something you'd
like to ask me, Beto?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.191
Is there something you
want to tell me, Vanessa?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.822
Your brother and I are...

14:24.822 --> 14:26.074
spending some time
together.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.658
We're just trying
to keep it quiet.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.952
Yeah, so smart!
So smart!

14:29.952 --> 14:32.080
See, you don't want people
weighing in their opinions.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.623
Or, you know,
laying out the odds

14:33.623 --> 14:35.124
when you guys are
gonna break up.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.043
‐Exactly. Mm‐hmm.
‐Exactly. Yeah.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.796
Figured I'd oughta
let you know
to prepare yourself.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.881
Not let you get in
too deep.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.591
And you could always
pre‐dump him.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.260
Get out of the way
of the inevitable heartbreak.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.596
‐I'll take that
under advisement.
‐Okay.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.931
You know I hate to say it,
you're not even
his first Vanessa.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.516
Or the second.
You're his third!

14:53.810 --> 14:56.062
It was a very popular name
in the '90s.

14:59.357 --> 15:02.819
No! No. It's‐‐
it's not a problem.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.320
Alonzo didn't have papers.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.197
Lots of people who work here
don't have papers.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.199
‐Right, Emilio?
‐Yeah. Right.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.993
People who have worked here
longer than I have.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.205
I mean, I'd be crazy to bring on
somebody who's undocumented
when I can find somebody who is.

15:14.205 --> 15:17.750
‐I get it, sir. Thank you
for taking the time‐‐
‐Eh, don't call him "sir."

15:19.001 --> 15:21.504
You can't make an exception?
This is a friend of mine.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.089
‐It's okay, Lucía.
‐It is not okay!

15:24.841 --> 15:27.802
If I get in trouble for
looking the other way, it
could affect my DACA status.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.428
Are you really
asking me to risk that?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.430
Matthew, where
are you going?

15:36.185 --> 15:38.146
Matthew! Wait!

15:38.146 --> 15:39.230
Please!

15:39.230 --> 15:41.232
Can you just stop?!

15:43.276 --> 15:44.944
Why didn't you tell me?

15:44.944 --> 15:47.196
I told you the stuff
that matters most.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.366
That I left home.
That I'm on my own.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.617
My list of problems goes:

15:51.617 --> 15:52.827
Where am I gonna sleep?

15:52.827 --> 15:54.162
Where's my next meal
coming from?

15:54.162 --> 15:55.830
Are my parents
gonna come after me?

15:55.830 --> 15:58.166
And then all the way down
at the bottom,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.459
what does the government
say about my citizenship status?

16:01.627 --> 16:04.589
Okay, well, maybe that's
something we can fix.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.090
‐Pfft...
‐Hey!

16:06.090 --> 16:08.801
I'm trying to help you.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.012
Can't you see that?

16:15.266 --> 16:18.227
Or maybe you've never had
anyone on your side before?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.896
Is that it?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.324
‐Just sign here at the bottom?
‐Emilio: Mm‐hmm.

16:33.618 --> 16:34.619
You got a pen? (laughs)

16:37.205 --> 16:38.331
(chuckles)

16:40.208 --> 16:42.668
When they send you
the official license
with your name on it,

16:42.668 --> 16:44.170
I'm gonna throw you a dinner.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.215
‐That's not necessary.
‐The hell it ain't!

16:47.215 --> 16:49.217
This is a big deal.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.595
Your dad'd be so glad
to see you step up like this.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.055
He never thought you would.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.684
‐Yeah, well, you do what you
gotta do, right?
‐Yeah...

16:58.684 --> 17:01.062
You know, it meant a lot to me
to be able to help out this way.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.606
I always thought
it was terrible

17:03.606 --> 17:05.191
how this country
treated people like him.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.612
So if we could just
clear out my share
of the bar this quarter?

17:09.612 --> 17:11.364
Why don't we just
call ourselves even?

17:13.074 --> 17:14.116
(chuckles)

17:17.578 --> 17:19.997
Oh... don't do that.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.917
You're gonna
renegotiate with me

17:22.917 --> 17:24.085
after 16 years
of our two families‐‐

17:24.085 --> 17:27.338
Don't give me "two families"
bullshit, Uncle Louie.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.757
You took advantage
of us the entire time.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.092
Because my father
had no choice

17:31.092 --> 17:32.677
but to say yes
and thank you.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.180
And keep it to himself.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.140
That's not how
your father saw it.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.727
‐He knew we were friends.
‐Yeah... friends.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.105
My father apparently thought
everyone was his friend.

17:45.481 --> 17:49.151
Friends don't charge 30%
of a bar receipt for 16 years!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.194
Listen...

17:51.445 --> 17:54.782
I risked my own neck
to help your dad
build the business.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.075
That's worth something. Right?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.704
Now you wanna put a stop
to the arrangement,
I got no problem.

18:02.373 --> 18:06.168
But I do got a problem
with you reneging on
what I'm owed to date.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.090
‐Really?
‐Really.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.635
Well, what are you
gonna do, Louie?

18:14.635 --> 18:16.137
Sue me?

18:16.137 --> 18:18.264
For not paying the money
you're owed for illegally

18:18.264 --> 18:20.099
fronting a liquor license?

18:27.189 --> 18:29.900
Yep. Now you know
how my father felt.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.576
Look, consider
yourself lucky.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.536
They're not processing
new applications.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.874
But since your parents
got you DACA status
when you first came here,

18:44.874 --> 18:47.001
‐all you need to do is‐‐
‐I'm not giving them
my information.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.462
It doesn't feel safe.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.466
Matt. Come on, please.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.426
That's what they do.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.221
They prepare DACA renewals
all the time.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.475
They're on your side.
They're here to help.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.185
How do you know?

19:04.185 --> 19:06.437
How do you know there
isn't some ICE officers
waiting inside?

19:06.437 --> 19:08.147
Disguised as someone?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.316
Like, waiting for someone
like me to come out
of the woodwork.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.233
To reveal himself.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.862
How do you know
there isn't someone
