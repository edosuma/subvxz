Previously

00:07.625 --> 00:09.083
We're doing a massive
cap raise. And quickly.

00:09.166 --> 00:11.750

00:14.792 --> 00:15.625
We need
Grigor Andolov.

00:15.709 --> 00:17.875
There was
this little boy.

00:17.959 --> 00:21.875
And I take his mother
away from the square.

00:21.959 --> 00:22.959
Behind the soldiers.

00:23.041 --> 00:27.750
After, I leave her
for the soldiers.

00:27.834 --> 00:30.917
This little boy, do you
know what happened to him?

00:31.000 --> 00:31.542
No.

Frances Lynch.

00:37.667 --> 00:38.709
Hi.

00:38.792 --> 00:40.291
-Yes. I am.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.250
Unless you're going to swing
on me like some Irish punk?

00:42.333 --> 00:45.250
They say you can't ride
two horses with one behind,

00:45.333 --> 00:47.083
but in today's business world,
it's a smart move,

00:47.166 --> 00:49.959
Still pretty sharp
for an old dog.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.125
When we spoke this morning,
you were in California.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.041
You came to help me

00:53.125 --> 00:55.583
To keep
you company.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.250
You are now officially
but unofficially

00:57.333 --> 01:00.959
the proud owner of half
of my half of Panay's fund,

01:01.041 --> 01:03.250
You decide what's right
and what's wrong.

01:03.333 --> 01:04.083
With no one to appease.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.291
You're forgetting
Jock Jeffcoat.

01:06.375 --> 01:08.917
His thumb pressing down

01:09.000 --> 01:09.959
It's not

01:10.041 --> 01:12.000

Jock anymore.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.291

19:56.375 --> 19:58.834
-It isn't.

19:58.917 --> 20:01.041
But there's a kernel
of an idea that's grown...

20:06.166 --> 20:07.041
But I couldn't pitch it.

20:07.125 --> 20:11.792
And then, I couldn't
even...go...

20:13.375 --> 20:13.500

20:19.375 --> 20:21.208
It's hard to concentrate with
all of you watching right now.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.375

I had pee fright.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.083

20:32.333 --> 20:35.083
We do assessments
of everyone who works here.

20:35.166 --> 20:38.417
To see who might be a candidate
for one of these offices.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.667
The C

20:39.750 --> 20:40.500
That's right.

20:40.583 --> 20:41.583
Most of the time
it just confirms

20:41.667 --> 20:44.125
that most folks are exactly
where they should be.

20:44.208 --> 20:47.625
They've topped out. Or worse,
are going to bottom out.

20:47.709 --> 20:49.834
Is that what mine says?

20:49.917 --> 20:51.542
Would I have brought you up here
if you were bottoming out?

20:51.625 --> 20:53.875
No...?

20:53.959 --> 20:56.166
Well, actually, I might.
If I thought you needed a jolt.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.333
But this is not that. This is:
right now, at this moment,

20:58.417 --> 21:00.125
if you want to finally
live the fuck up

21:00.208 --> 21:01.333
to your potential
instead of spiraling,

21:01.417 --> 21:05.041
you must find a way
to shift the paradigm.

21:07.041 --> 21:08.625
That could be
your office,

21:08.709 --> 21:09.792

21:09.875 --> 21:11.166
CIO, picking
the strategies.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.792
COO, managing
the risk.

21:12.875 --> 21:13.208
Eh...

21:13.291 --> 21:15.625
Maybe even...

21:15.709 --> 21:17.959
Owner?

21:18.041 --> 21:20.667
Yes, instead of
being down there,

21:20.750 --> 21:22.333
with them.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.500
But that's where
I'm comfortable.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.500
No. It's where you've
made yourself fit.

21:25.583 --> 21:30.041
Because you're so bound up
in being the smallest,

21:30.125 --> 21:33.166
most helpful, unobtrusive
version of yourself.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.208
Just like your mother

21:34.291 --> 21:35.542
shits on your head for.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.208
Now, what you need to do
to prove her wrong,

21:37.291 --> 21:40.250
and prove it to yourself,
is something

21:40.333 --> 21:41.875
totally out of character,
big and bold.

21:41.959 --> 21:44.875
Something public,

21:44.959 --> 21:47.166
that terrifies you,
in order to free yourself.

21:47.250 --> 21:51.875

to a crowd.
