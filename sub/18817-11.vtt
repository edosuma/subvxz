WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.506
[rapid knocking on door]

00:08.883 --> 00:11.010
-Who is it?
-It's Penelope. Open up.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.098
One in the morning, eh?

00:15.182 --> 00:17.350
Okay. Either something happened
in your apartment,

00:17.434 --> 00:20.353
or something's about to happen in mine.

00:21.854 --> 00:22.980
Ugh!

00:24.232 --> 00:26.818
You'd be surprised
how many of my hookups started with "Ugh!"

00:29.196 --> 00:30.530
[Penelope sighs]

00:33.533 --> 00:34.951
Elena...

00:36.286 --> 00:37.370
just came out to me.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.122
[sighs] Finally!

00:40.915 --> 00:43.418
That is a load off my mind.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.629
-You knew?
-Yeah.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.423
It's been super tough keeping it from you.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.049
That's why I've been hanging around
so much less.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.926
You've had dinner with us
four times this week.

00:52.009 --> 00:53.595
Crazy, right? I'm like a ghost.

00:54.762 --> 00:57.099
Anyway, she never actually told me.
Alex did.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.226
-Wait, Alex knows, too?
-Yeah.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.435
But it hasn't affected him at all.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.645
And I walked him through
everything I know about lesbians.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.107
Don't worry. I barely know anything.

01:06.608 --> 01:10.403
So, Alex is cool, Elena is cool. Great.
Great, great, great. [chuckles]

01:10.487 --> 01:12.029
-You don't sound great.
-I'm not great.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.283
[sighs] Can I admit something dark to you?

01:16.326 --> 01:19.162
When you eat sushi,
you sometimes imagine the fish screaming?

01:22.624 --> 01:24.959
I feel really weird
about all this Elena stuff.

01:25.793 --> 01:28.171
Whoa. Are you homophobic?

01:28.255 --> 01:29.506
No!

01:29.589 --> 01:32.008
I would never judge anyone
based on their sexual orientation.

01:32.091 --> 01:33.426
Some of my best friends are gay.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.303
Yeah, that's actually not something--

01:35.386 --> 01:37.013
I know you're not supposed to say that!

01:38.223 --> 01:40.057
It's just that now that it's my daughter,
it's different.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.310
I hate that I feel weird about it,
but I do.

01:42.810 --> 01:45.021
-Well, what does your mother think?
-[chuckles nervously]

01:46.148 --> 01:47.274
When she finds out, you'll know,

01:47.357 --> 01:48.233
because she'll be on the roof

01:48.316 --> 01:50.568
with a Bat-Signal
shaped like the pope's hat.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.739
He does have a popemobile.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.325
And a cape.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.327
Huh.

02:01.621 --> 02:02.705
Focus, Schneider.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.999
Okay, hey, sit down.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.418
[sighs] My advice?

02:08.920 --> 02:11.423
If you're feeling weird... hide it.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.969
When I was 15, I told Father
I wanted to be a professional tap dancer.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.142
He laughed.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.145
It was that lack of support that...

02:25.687 --> 02:27.772
contributed to my drinking
and drug problem.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.527
Professional tap dancer?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.822
Oh, do you find that amusing?

02:37.365 --> 02:39.659
Because 15-year-old Schneider's drinking
peach schnapps

02:39.742 --> 02:41.578
out of an unused tap shoe right now.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.207
-[sighs]
-Oh, God, you're right.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.751
My reaction could really affect Elena
for the rest of her life.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.420
She needs to think
that I'm cool with everything

02:50.503 --> 02:52.964
because I don't want her to turn out like,
no offense, you.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.050
Schneider, you coming back to bed?

03:00.222 --> 03:01.764
Yeah, I do all right.

03:03.140 --> 03:06.228
You have a girl over here
and you were offering to have sex with me?

03:06.811 --> 03:09.647
Yes, Penelope.
That's the kind of friend I am.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.276
[theme song playing]

04:02.199 --> 04:04.118
Hi,  Mami.  She can't hear me.

04:05.202 --> 04:07.747
There's my perfect daughter
who I love so much,

04:07.830 --> 04:10.041
but won't call beautiful
because she doesn't like it

04:10.124 --> 04:13.002
when people emphasize
the importance of physical appearance.

04:13.961 --> 04:16.256
Uh, good morning to you, too.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.968
Hey, last night I did a little reading
on Autostraddle,

04:21.052 --> 04:23.763
the lesbian lifestyle
and pop-culture website?

04:25.473 --> 04:27.267
-Really?
-Yeah!

04:27.350 --> 04:29.143
I learned a ton of interesting stuff.

04:29.226 --> 04:32.314
Fun fact, did you know
monocles had a huge following

04:32.397 --> 04:35.483
in the stylish lesbian circles
of the early 20th century?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.152
If this is your way of telling me

04:38.235 --> 04:39.612
that you're getting me a monocle
for my birthday,

04:39.696 --> 04:40.697
I'm gonna be really upset.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.409
Or we could talk about Gaga instead.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.577
-Lady Gaga?
-Yeah.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.622
Is she a gay icon,
or just a publicity monger?

04:51.165 --> 04:53.334
I don't know,
she's, like, a thousand years old.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.672
So you're probably not interested in
what I found out about Eleanor Roosevelt?

05:00.132 --> 05:01.843
Tons of monocles.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.260
[chuckles]

05:04.220 --> 05:07.640
Mom, I get it. You're aggressively okay
with my sexuality.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.225
Of course! Who wouldn't be?

05:09.809 --> 05:11.060
DJ  Abuelita  over there?

05:14.731 --> 05:15.898
[softly] Oh, all right.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.525
I'm worried about coming out to her.

05:17.609 --> 05:18.735
Oh, really?

05:18.818 --> 05:20.570
You're not ready to have her
follow you in the streets,

05:20.653 --> 05:21.863
ringing the shame bell?

05:22.364 --> 05:24.741
I think I'm gonna wait
until after my  quinces.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.244
All she's talked about the past two weeks
is my stupid dance with Josh.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.579
[sighs] Right.  Ay.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.164
Poor Josh. How's he gonna handle this?

05:32.248 --> 05:33.833
I bet he's gonna feel really weird
about it.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.002
But that's understandable, right?

05:36.085 --> 05:38.295
No, I already told him
and he's totally cool.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.215
I mean, he insisted on being
my dance partner to show his support.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.301
Awesome!

05:44.051 --> 05:47.597
I'm glad everyone is so cool
and doesn't feel weird in any way at all.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.516
[chuckles] You go, Josh!

05:50.141 --> 05:51.643
[chuckles]

05:51.726 --> 05:54.604
Ah! There are my beautiful  niñas.

05:54.687 --> 05:58.816
Elena, I'm doing the final tweaks
on the  quinces  choreography,

05:58.900 --> 06:02.111
so I really want you
to concentrate on your posture.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.655
Head high, shoulders back.

06:05.656 --> 06:06.532
Straighter.

06:08.075 --> 06:09.285
Straighter.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.915
Be as straight as you can be!

06:21.088 --> 06:22.715
Oh, my God, you guys.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.884
I just got an e-mail
from my baseball coach and--

06:24.967 --> 06:26.218
I made the travel team!

06:27.219 --> 06:29.013
Him. He made the travel team.

06:29.096 --> 06:30.097
Oh! [chuckles]

06:30.181 --> 06:31.182
[Schneider] Oh, man.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.518
All those practices I took you to
finally paid off.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.353
I did it! Him. He did it.

06:36.438 --> 06:37.814
I'm so pumped.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.899
Travel team is the first step
toward the big leagues.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.860
Mom, when I get there,
I'm buying you a house.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.947
Aw. So sweet, honey.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.032
But it won't be near my mansion.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.329
No one wants their mom around
when they're dating models.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.873
Just being real with you.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.416
You still have Spider-Man sheets.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.794
Just being real with you.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.880
But congratulations,  papito!

07:02.964 --> 07:04.841
-That's great news!
-[clapping]

07:05.508 --> 07:07.719
-That's terrible news.
-Huh?

07:07.802 --> 07:09.596
There is no way he can join that team.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.888
-What?
-Why?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.099
Those games are so far away,
you have to spend the night.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.559
I can't miss that much work.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.311
Well, I probably can.
Let me just check with my boss.

07:17.394 --> 07:18.896
Schneider? You do you.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.939
We're good.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.236
So... how about
I take Alex to travel games?

07:25.319 --> 07:27.321
[both laughing]

07:27.404 --> 07:29.115
-What?
-Just it's...

07:29.198 --> 07:31.033
You don't get it. It's not about you.

07:31.784 --> 07:36.163
We're Cuban. We don't trust anyone,
outside of blood, to look after our kids.

07:36.247 --> 07:40.627
You want to take him on a trip overnight
to a strange city?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.044
Jajaja. Qué  funny.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.048
Sorry, Schneider.
Look, I barely trust her with the kids.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.175
And I'm offended, but I get it.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.428
Come on.
I think you're being a little unfair.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.473
I can take care of Alex
as well as you can.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.016
[both scoffing]

07:55.099 --> 07:56.893
All right.
You think you got what it takes?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.605
-Bedtime?
-9:00 p.m. weekdays. 10:00 p.m., weekends.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.106
-Blood type?
-O positive.

08:02.189 --> 08:03.566
Wrong. Red.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.280
Mami,  I got this.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.534
Preferred sandwich, tuna or turkey?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.410
Trick question. He's allergic to tuna,

08:14.494 --> 08:18.831
and as for a turkey sandwich, he would
quote, "Rather drink a cup of barf."

08:19.582 --> 08:23.836
Look, I can send constant updates,
drop GPS pins of his location.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.131
I know a guy at the pet store,
we could chip him.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.343
[speaking Spanish]

08:31.427 --> 08:33.638
[speaking Spanish]

08:33.721 --> 08:34.806
[in English] Okay, fine.

08:36.891 --> 08:37.892
You can take him.

08:38.475 --> 08:42.564
But if my son comes back with
even a little scratch on his head...

08:43.648 --> 08:44.649
I was in the army.

08:45.482 --> 08:47.735
I don't know how to waterboard,
'cause they don't teach it...

08:48.986 --> 08:50.988
[whispering] except they do.

08:55.201 --> 08:59.831
-And... one, two, three, four...
-[tapping rhythmically]

08:59.914 --> 09:03.459
five, six, seven, eight.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.504
Point that toe... Move the hips...

09:07.589 --> 09:09.549
-Not like that.
-Oh.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.259
Arms up...

09:12.843 --> 09:14.512
and pull her close.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.973
[sing-song] Closer.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.769
Closer.

09:22.269 --> 09:25.064
Closer.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.859
[sighs]  Ay, qué bien.

09:27.942 --> 09:31.571
And this would be the moment
when you would kiss, but you shouldn't.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.615
Unless I look away right now.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.450
Oh... is that Andy Garcia?

09:38.410 --> 09:41.163
Oh, you are exchanging secret looks.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.958
How am I going
to keep you two lovebirds apart?

09:44.041 --> 09:46.335
-Oh! [chuckles]
-[laughing]

09:46.418 --> 09:47.879
Oh, whoa!

09:48.462 --> 09:52.341
This is giving me flashbacks
of Tiana's  quinces/ baby shower.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.470
She is jealous.

09:56.553 --> 09:59.431
Josh, you will be the envy
of every boy at the  quinces.

09:59.515 --> 10:04.645
And, Elena, all of the girls will wish
it was them inside your dress. [chuckles]

10:06.773 --> 10:08.107
Dare to dream.

10:09.316 --> 10:10.860
[cell phone rings]

10:12.028 --> 10:13.237
Uh-oh...

10:14.113 --> 10:16.032
Why are you calling, Schneider?
Is Alex hurt?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.618
You might have a two-hour head start,
but I will hunt you down.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.577
Relax, everything is great.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.830
I was calling to let you know
we checked into the hotel

10:22.914 --> 10:25.207
twelve minutes ahead of schedule.
Hey, Ron.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.044
Hey, Nikki.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.464
Finn's mom is, what she calls,
out-of-town single.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.718
But don't worry,
I got my eye on the ball.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.386
-How's the hotel?
-[clears throat]

10:37.469 --> 10:39.722
"His room is close to a fire escape

10:39.806 --> 10:45.102
and the nearest elevator was inspected
on April 17th by an S. Balaban."

10:45.812 --> 10:47.104
[clears throat] Ooh, I gotta run.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.606
Walk carefully. I mean, walk carefully.
No one's running.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.443
[Lydia]  Ay, mi niña preciosa.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.945
[speaking Spanish]

10:55.029 --> 10:56.530
[in English] What's happening?

10:57.114 --> 10:59.283
-I just came out to  Abuelita.
-[chuckles]

11:00.159 --> 11:01.327
You did?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.455
And I think it's beautiful.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.248
[gasps] You do?

11:06.833 --> 11:10.920
Claro.  And I accept it immediately,
no questions asked.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.129
[chuckles]

11:14.298 --> 11:16.050
Well, that is great. [chuckles]

11:16.133 --> 11:18.803
Ms. Alvarez, you have the coolest family.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.013
I'm gonna call my grandma.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.432
Maybe she's finally ready
to hear that I'm a vegan.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.480
I'm gonna Skype Carmen
and tell her the awesome news.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.233
-[chuckles]
-I love my family!

11:33.067 --> 11:35.611
We love you, too. [laughing]

11:36.403 --> 11:37.696
I told you.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.992
Wait, so you're not okay with it?

11:41.075 --> 11:43.327
No, I am very upset.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.789
Oh, thank God. I mean, thank God,  Mami,
that you're so honest with your feelings.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.333
Yeah, I know you don't agree with them,

11:49.416 --> 11:51.252
because you are so liberal...

11:52.253 --> 11:55.756
and I'm just a narrow-minded
homofallopian.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.766
-You mean you're homophobic?
-Ha! There is the judgment.

12:07.101 --> 12:11.814
Look... I know you are cool with this,

12:12.398 --> 12:14.024
but you have to understand.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.860
I am a religious woman.

12:15.943 --> 12:16.944
[clicks tongue]

12:17.611 --> 12:18.571
I know,  Mami.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.197
And I'm sorry.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.617
I'm sorry, but I have a problem
with Elena being gay.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.204
-[breathes deeply]
-It goes against God!

12:28.039 --> 12:30.499
Although, God did make us in his image.

12:30.582 --> 12:33.002
And God doesn't make mistakes.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.587
Clearly.

12:37.673 --> 12:41.802
And when it comes to the gays,
the pope did say, "Who am I to judge?"

12:42.011 --> 12:44.680
And the pope represents God.

12:44.763 --> 12:48.642
So what,
am I going to go against the pope and God?

12:48.726 --> 12:50.519
Who the hell do I think I am?

12:52.188 --> 12:54.606
Okay. Okay, I'm good.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.400
[exhales heavily]

12:56.483 --> 12:57.819
What?

13:00.654 --> 13:03.866
-You just worked that out in ten seconds?
-Sí.

13:05.617 --> 13:10.081
Because she is my granddaughter
and I love her no matter what.  Ya.

13:10.164 --> 13:14.126
So, tell me, when is the parade? [laughs]

13:16.337 --> 13:17.421
Okay, you guys wait here.

13:17.504 --> 13:18.547
I'll check for intruders,

13:18.630 --> 13:21.425
put a safety lock on the toilet seat,
and sweep for tuna.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.344
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.471
-Okay, guys. Guys, slow down.
-This room is awesome!

13:25.554 --> 13:27.139
-Ow! Okay.
-Dibs on this bed.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.058
-No, this bed!
-Guys.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.562
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

13:33.645 --> 13:36.315
Stop, wait. Okay, stop. Stop!

13:38.275 --> 13:41.403
So, you're obviously tired from the game.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.573
Maybe it's time for bed.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.868
It's six o'clock.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.954
Yeah, Mr. Schneider, don't you wanna
go hang out with the other parents?

13:50.037 --> 13:53.832
[scoffs] Finn, you little rascal
that I don't trust.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.920
-Who wants to play a game of I Spy?
-This guy!

13:58.004 --> 13:59.380
When I was three.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.841
Jajaja. Qué  funny.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.718
Okay, I'll start.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.556
[clears throat] I spy, with my little eye,

14:08.639 --> 14:13.227
something...
that is clearly a fire hazard!

14:16.063 --> 14:18.900
Hey, Mr. Schneider,
can you go get us some ice?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.402
What? Is someone injured?
Oh, my God. Is it Gordon?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.904
Yeah, he does not look well.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.950
I'll be back in a jiff.
Everybody, stand under the sprinklers.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.710
Ramona, thank you,
thank you for meeting me!

14:38.794 --> 14:40.963
So great to see you.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.424
So, uh, a gay bar, huh?

14:43.507 --> 14:44.967
Immersion therapy.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.844
You gotta get used to being
around gay people,

14:47.929 --> 14:49.055
now that I know you hate us.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.183
[scoffs] I don't hate gay people!

14:55.394 --> 14:57.563
No, I don't.
You heard that "I don't" part, right?

14:58.272 --> 15:00.441
Ay,  next round's on me.
[chuckles nervously]

15:00.524 --> 15:02.276
Okay, I'm a mess.

15:04.611 --> 15:06.197
I need some gay guidance. [sighs]

15:06.280 --> 15:08.532
-Let's just call it guidance.
-Okay. That's good.

15:08.615 --> 15:10.409
That's what I need, already.
[chuckles] Okay?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.203
-[sighs] I'm feeling weird.
-[chuckling]

15:12.286 --> 15:13.787
[laughs] I am.

15:13.870 --> 15:16.373
I'm feeling like if I knew more,
I might feel better.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.251
I don't know. Does she all of a sudden
think all boys are disgusting?

15:19.335 --> 15:22.129
No! She always thought
they were disgusting.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.755
Okay.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.176
How will I know...

15:28.135 --> 15:31.472
if a girl she brings home
is a friend or more?

15:31.555 --> 15:32.681
Oh...

15:35.601 --> 15:36.727
[whispers] You ask her.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.771
Is she gonna tell me the truth?

15:39.855 --> 15:41.065
-Probably not.
-Ay,  Ramona!

15:41.148 --> 15:43.567
Well, what are you asking me?
How to spot a lesbian?

15:43.650 --> 15:46.320
I mean, do some of us
have short hair? Sure.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.740
Do we sometimes prefer
practical, gender-neutral clothing?

15:49.823 --> 15:50.824
I guess.

15:50.907 --> 15:54.245
Does a perfect day involve going
to candle-making class in our Subaru

15:54.328 --> 15:56.330
with a roof rack full of antiques?

15:56.413 --> 15:58.207
That's just solid American fun.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.670
[chuckles] Okay.
Now, I'm definitely more confused.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.839
Look, you are raising a smart girl

16:05.923 --> 16:08.050
who will be
a productive member of society.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.636
She's gonna have a full life and be okay.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.556
-Thank you. That's good.
-Good.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.308
-Great. Mmm-hmm.
-Great.

16:16.808 --> 16:19.186
-You still feel weird.
-I still feel weird!

16:19.270 --> 16:20.937
Mmm. [chuckling]

16:27.444 --> 16:28.570
You know what might help you?

16:29.863 --> 16:30.990
To see me in action.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.743
-How would that help?
-Honestly, I don't think it would,

16:34.826 --> 16:37.788
but I'm getting some serious eyes
from that  guapa  over there.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.626
I thought you were here
to give me guidance.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.463
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They can both wear dresses to the wedding,

16:46.547 --> 16:47.548
-it'll be fine.
-Ramona!

16:48.632 --> 16:51.177
-Uh, you wanna go over there?
-No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.597
[chuckles] But just out of curiosity...
what is that girl doing right now?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.144
She's looking at you
and biting her lower lip.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.520
[both chuckling]

17:02.521 --> 17:03.522
I gotta go.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.235
Hey, parents.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.321
I don't want to alarm you,
but the kids may already be dead.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.657
-What the hell you talking about?
-What? What are you...

17:13.740 --> 17:16.285
I got locked out of the room
and they're up there jumping on the beds.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.911
[Ron chuckles]

17:17.994 --> 17:19.955
Don't worry. The boys are fine.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.748
Yeah, that's the magic of hotel rooms.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.750
All they want to do is hang out in there.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.754
Yeah, they get excited
by tiny soaps and sewing kits.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.215
Kids are so stupid. [chuckles]

17:30.632 --> 17:33.302
Well, maybe I am overreacting.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.595
Yes.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.143
Maybe just for a minute.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.269
[chuckles]

17:42.353 --> 17:44.646
Oh, sorry. What can I say...

17:44.730 --> 17:47.233
Cubans are crazy about family.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.442
Oh, you Cuban?

17:48.525 --> 17:53.280
Not by birth,
but spiritually, I identify as Cuban.

17:54.531 --> 17:58.910
That's why I've been so overprotective.
It's what we do. [chuckles]

17:58.994 --> 18:02.873
I think we have some trust issues
because Castro and all of that.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.418
[sighs] You know.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.549
But it's good to get
an outsider's perspective.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.135
You guys have calmed me down.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.095
Maybe I was being a little suffocating.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.515
I need to talk to you about your kids.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.644
Ay, Dios mío.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.777
-Don't mess it up. Oh, and you know it.
-[music playing]

18:34.029 --> 18:35.156
[sighs]

18:36.448 --> 18:37.449
Drinking alone?

18:38.325 --> 18:39.409
This is a gay bar.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.703
That's what regular bars are for.

18:43.705 --> 18:47.584
Yeah, but regular bars
don't have $7 Queen-a-Coladas.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.171
Mmm, tell me about it.
This is my third Bloody Gary.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.464
Anyway...

18:54.550 --> 18:57.177
I'm drinking alone 'cause I'm a monster...

18:57.261 --> 18:59.346
and monsters drink alone.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.852
My daughter came out to me...

19:05.769 --> 19:07.980
and I am not totally okay with it.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.275
[clears throat]

19:14.611 --> 19:16.280
And I hate myself for it.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.241
Keep the Queen-a-Coladas coming.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.367
All right, all right.

19:20.451 --> 19:23.787
This is a subject
that I know a thing or two about,

19:23.870 --> 19:24.913
so talk to me.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.041
It's just that I'm ruining everything.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.296
I want her to have the most perfect
coming-out story.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.881
You know, where I'm cool
and supportive and...

19:34.965 --> 19:38.886
we high-five and ride unicorns
down a rainbow together. [chuckles]

19:39.386 --> 19:41.263
Okay, so, gay people aren't magic.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.267
But it's a common misconception, so...

19:46.852 --> 19:49.230
I should be feeling really happy...

19:49.313 --> 19:51.190
that she feels comfortable enough
to come out to me.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.149
But I just keep thinking...

19:58.154 --> 19:59.823
It's not the way I pictured it.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.035
I always imagined that we would...

20:05.161 --> 20:06.747
bond over boy stuff.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.585
How hot they are,
how dumb they are. [chuckles]

20:13.629 --> 20:15.171
The pregnancy scare.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.173
I hold her hand while she pees on a stick.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.176
We don't trust that stick,
so she pees on a second stick.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.638
It's negative
and we go get sushi. [chuckles]

20:24.055 --> 20:26.767
You know, you can still get sushi
without peeing on something.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.934
[chuckles]

20:29.603 --> 20:30.729
It's not the same.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.316
How long ago did your daughter come out?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.152
Thirty-six hours ago.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.155
Thirty-six hours
and you're not leading a pride parade?

20:40.239 --> 20:43.158
[scoffs] No, but my mom is.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.869
Let's get real.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.872
Do you love her any less?

20:48.955 --> 20:50.206
No, of course not.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.626
So you're just not there yet.

20:53.585 --> 20:57.548
This is a complete readjustment
of how you see your daughter.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.635
Trust me, she's been thinking about this
for months or years.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.637
You just found out.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.682
Your heart is okay.

21:07.891 --> 21:11.478
You just need a little time...
for your head to catch up.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.649
[sighs heavily]

21:17.233 --> 21:21.280
[sighs] I feel a thousand times better.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.156
Thank you! Oh!

21:23.657 --> 21:27.243
[sniffs] Oh, my God,
you smell so good. [laughs]

21:27.328 --> 21:30.581
Oh, this means so much
coming from a super-hot gay guy.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.123
Oh, thank you!

21:32.207 --> 21:34.418
[chuckles] I'm not gay.

21:36.002 --> 21:38.672
-[chuckles]
-Well, you're at a gay bar.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.716
And you're super hot. [chuckles]

21:40.799 --> 21:43.969
[chuckles] Again,
love what you're saying, but, uh,

21:44.052 --> 21:45.929
I'm here with my brother. He's gay.

21:48.390 --> 21:51.852
And to your point, it took me some time
to wrap my head around it.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.646
But now I'm good. And you will be, too.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.232
Thank you.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.320
I'd like to take this opportunity
to apologize

22:01.403 --> 22:03.071
for the smelling and the groping.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.660
Somehow when I thought
you hated the touch of women...

22:09.953 --> 22:11.538
I assumed it was okay.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.377
Luckily, I was too distracted
by how cute you are

22:17.461 --> 22:19.379
to hear anything you just said.

22:19.463 --> 22:22.215
What? [chuckles] Shut up.

22:24.175 --> 22:27.471
Can I see you again? Like, over dinner?

22:29.765 --> 22:30.849
Okay.

22:31.933 --> 22:32.851
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:34.269 --> 22:39.191
I'm sorry, I think this is the first time
I've ever been asked out in a gay bar.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.401
-Really?
-Yeah.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.070
I've been asked out,
like, nine times in the past hour.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.243
Hi, Mom.

22:50.326 --> 22:51.578
Hi! Wait.

22:52.579 --> 22:55.707
It's 11:00 at night. You're supposed to be
in San Diego. What happened?

22:55.791 --> 22:59.378
Okay, first of all, I wanna point out
that Alex is 100% okay.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.797
So there's absolutely no need to panic.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.214
What happened?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.384
Nothing.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.469
Nothing?

23:07.553 --> 23:10.764
The boys stole two maid's carts
and were racing them down the hallway!

23:10.847 --> 23:12.057
And I won!

23:13.725 --> 23:15.060
Not the point. I get it.

23:16.311 --> 23:19.064
Fortunately, security found me
before anything else happened.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.524
Found you? You weren't with them?

23:20.607 --> 23:23.360
-[sighs]
-Get the water boards.

23:25.278 --> 23:28.490
Wait, I don't understand.
If he's okay, why didn't you just call?

23:28.574 --> 23:30.742
[scoffs] Because there's, like,
a zero percent chance

23:30.826 --> 23:32.285
you would believe Alex was all right

23:32.369 --> 23:34.162
unless he was standing
right in front of you.

23:34.245 --> 23:35.956
You guys, I'm so sorry.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.251
I mean, a maid's cart?
More like death wagon.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.045
Tiny soaps you can choke on.

23:42.129 --> 23:46.091
Shower caps that can fly off
into your face and suffocate you.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.886
And is that a clean toilet brush?
I think not!

23:51.304 --> 23:52.430
[sighs] Anyway,
now you're gonna yell at me

23:52.514 --> 23:54.182
and tell me
I'm never allowed near your family.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.475
Just make it quick.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.685
[Schneider sighs]

23:58.186 --> 23:59.229
Aw...

24:00.147 --> 24:02.065
I got in your head.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.525
What?

24:05.026 --> 24:08.321
I made you as overprotective
and crazy as I am.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.115
You proved I can trust you.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.117
-Really?
-Yeah, you're Cuban now.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.285
¡Azúcar!  [chuckles]

24:14.369 --> 24:16.162
But we only forgive once.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.332
God, I feel so much better.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.462
And that is the last time
I listen to a bunch of gringo parents.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.173
They do not share our values.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.678
-It sounds like Texas isn't that bad.
-[Carmen]  I love it.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.306
I'm really getting into saying y'all.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.474
I'm like a little southern belle.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.893
[knocking on door]

24:39.185 --> 24:42.606
Hi, Elena. Hi, Carmen!

24:42.689 --> 24:44.650
Hi, Ms. Y'alvarez.

24:45.526 --> 24:49.445
Can I just give you props for being
hella cool about Elena coming out?

24:49.530 --> 24:51.322
Thank you, Carmen.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.117
I'm just happy that Elena
is such a strong young woman

24:54.200 --> 24:56.578
-with a clear sense of herself.
-[chuckles]

24:57.954 --> 24:59.915
And she has excellent taste in friends.

25:00.624 --> 25:04.586
Compliments make me kind of queasy,
so I'm gonna bounce.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.214
I'm going to the rodeo tomorrow.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.884
Hopefully,
one of the clowns will get gored.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.344
[both laughing]

25:14.804 --> 25:16.181
I love that little weirdo.

25:17.641 --> 25:18.517
Whoo!

25:18.600 --> 25:20.101
You're in a good mood.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.978
-Am I?
-Yeah, why?

25:23.063 --> 25:24.690
Okay, I met a guy.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.024
-What?
-Yes.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.943
-Dish. Tell me everything!
-[chuckles]

25:28.026 --> 25:30.278
Okay, his name is Ben.
I met him at a gay bar.

25:30.361 --> 25:32.906
-What? That's right, I'm cool.
-[both chuckle]

25:32.989 --> 25:37.035
He was there with his brother,
and he was super cute and easy to talk to,

25:37.118 --> 25:39.746
and then he wasn't gay.
And then he asked me out!

25:39.830 --> 25:41.873
-Shut up!
-I mean, who knows if he'll even call,

25:41.957 --> 25:44.876
but it was just exciting,
you know, meeting someone new and...

25:44.960 --> 25:47.212
flirting, making a connection.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.380
I can't wait for that. [chuckles]

25:50.298 --> 25:51.633
It'll happen.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.846
And I hope you'll keep me
in the loop when it does.

25:55.929 --> 25:59.140
[scoffs] Are you kidding?
I'm going to tell you everything.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.102
-[chuckles]
-Mmm.

26:02.185 --> 26:06.607
So, here's a question. You and Carmen?

26:06.690 --> 26:09.985
[scoffs] Oh, no! We're just best friends.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.570
I mean, she says...

26:11.653 --> 26:15.240
[mimicking Carmen]
"All love is a selfish sickness." [sighs]

26:16.867 --> 26:19.202
-[normal] Her boyfriend is miserable.
-[both chuckle]

26:19.285 --> 26:20.495
[cell phone vibrates]

26:21.913 --> 26:23.749
[gasps] Oh, my God!

26:23.832 --> 26:25.876
It's Ben! [chuckles]

26:25.959 --> 26:29.545
"It was so great meeting you.
Best part of my night."

26:29.630 --> 26:31.965
-Should I text back?
-No, no. Play it cool.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.717
You play it cool. I'm texting back.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.426
No, no, Mom,
you have to play hard to get!

26:35.510 --> 26:36.845
No, I don't wanna play hard to get!
