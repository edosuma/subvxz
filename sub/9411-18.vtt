- Who's this?

16:52.666 --> 16:56.100
This used to be your brother.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.966
Whoa! What is this,
some kind of joke?

16:58.966 --> 17:00.966
It's not a joke.
You have to help us.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.666
Remember that evil camera
we found last year?

17:03.666 --> 17:05.733
It's back,
and we're under its curse again.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.933
You have to reverse these photos.

17:08.933 --> 17:12.266
Take this negative
and make it a positive.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.733
And take this positive
and make it a negative.

17:19.165 --> 17:21.566
- Can you do it?
- I don't know.

17:22.066 --> 17:24.400
- Uh, I'll try.
- If you change these pictures,

17:24.400 --> 17:26.766
maybe it'll reverse
what's happening to us.

17:26.766 --> 17:29.800
We don't know if it'll work,
but it's our only chance.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.800
I don't believe this.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.966
Please!
We don't have much time left.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.333
Oh. I can feel it.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.300
- I'm gonna explode.
- Please, Terry!

17:40.300 --> 17:42.400
Okay. Okay.

17:43.333 --> 17:47.400
Please, Terry,
before it's too late.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.833
I don't want anyone to see you.

17:53.733 --> 17:56.100
Back there.

17:57.033 --> 18:00.533
Shari, you're wasting away.
Here.

18:00.533 --> 18:03.633
Try to eat this chocolate bar.

18:03.633 --> 18:06.800
I can't. I'm too weak.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.133
Terry, hurry up!

18:10.633 --> 18:12.866
I'm working as fast as I can!

18:15.466 --> 18:18.466
[ Both Groaning ]

18:21.633 --> 18:26.500
Terry! Terry!

18:28.400 --> 18:31.600
- [ Shouting ]
- It's too late.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.700
- Too late.
- Shari!

18:34.700 --> 18:36.900
No!

18:49.833 --> 18:52.333
Greg! Shari!

18:52.933 --> 18:54.866
Greg!

18:54.866 --> 18:58.466
It-- It worked!
It worked!

18:59.400 --> 19:02.166
[ Greg ]
By reversing the pictures,

19:02.166 --> 19:06.033
Terry was able to return Shari
and I back to normal size.

19:06.033 --> 19:08.633
- And here's the camera that caused it all.
- [ Warbling ]

19:09.600 --> 19:12.166
- Well, Mr. Saur?
- "Well" what?

19:12.600 --> 19:14.866
- Do I get an "A" now?
- No, you get an "F."

19:14.866 --> 19:17.666
- What?   - Anybody can come
in here with a silly contraption...

19:17.666 --> 19:19.700
and say that it has fantastic powers.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.466
You haven't proven anything.

19:21.466 --> 19:25.033
But I was a blimp.
Now I'm thin.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.900
- How do you explain that?
- The costume.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.766
I knew it all along.
Mr. Banks, you have no idea...

19:30.766 --> 19:33.766
to what lengths students will go
to get an "A" in this class,

19:33.766 --> 19:35.766
which they have never gotten.

19:35.766 --> 19:37.933
Of course, you went
a little further than most.

19:37.933 --> 19:41.066
- So you still don't believe my story?
- No, I do not.

19:41.066 --> 19:45.966
There is, however, one way to prove
that your story is true.

19:45.966 --> 19:49.800
- How?
- Take a picture with this evil camera.

19:50.233 --> 19:53.633
No!
Please don't!

19:53.633 --> 19:55.500
[ Camera Warbling ]

19:57.666 --> 20:01.600
Oh! Look at this.
That's-- That's quite amusing.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.933
You've got a--
An instant camera in there,

20:04.933 --> 20:06.933
and here's a trick photograph.

20:06.933 --> 20:10.133
You went to a lot of trouble though.
[ Sighs ]

20:10.133 --> 20:12.300
It's not a trick.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.533
Of course it's a trick.
What are you talking about?

20:17.733 --> 20:20.633
- [ Boy ] Look! He's losing his hair!
- [ Laughter ]

20:20.633 --> 20:22.766
- [ greg ] You got your proof.
- What's happening--

20:26.366 --> 20:28.666
What's happening here?

20:29.666 --> 20:32.966
What's happening?
