Why do you need

I asked them to solve
the mystery of Papa's death.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.688
Mystery? He had a heart attack.

02:03.732 --> 02:06.169
That's what we thought
until we performed an autopsy.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.779
And who asked you to do that?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.520
I did.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.261
It was my last gift to Papa.

And you stand to inherit
half his estate.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.297
I didn't go upstairs until 6:00.

And the coroner said Papa died
before 1:00.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.736
This is ludicrous.

did something she didn't do.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.268
Let's hope you're right.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.879
Don't worry.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.184
I'm sure everything
will work out

10:20.228 --> 10:21.664
exactly as it should.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.277
Where are you off to?

10:26.321 --> 10:29.063
Oh, I have some unfinished
business to attend to.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.195
Downtown.
Put those in the good vase.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.197
I'll be back soon
to make a nice dinner.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.156
And don't forget,

10:35.199 --> 10:37.811
tonight we're meeting
our future son-in-law.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.943
All things considered,

10:39.987 --> 10:42.032
it's a happy day.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.089
Well?

10:55.132 --> 10:56.438
How'd it go?

10:56.481 --> 10:58.005
My parents can't wait
to meet you,

10:58.048 --> 10:59.659
and dinner
will be served at 7:30.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.270
And you told them everything?

11:02.313 --> 11:04.664
About the engagement
and the baby?

11:04.707 --> 11:06.056
I told them we're engaged.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.971
That was enough happiness
for one morning.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.973
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

11:10.017 --> 11:13.281
Look, I just want them to know
how much I love you.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.589
And I don't mind that you're
carrying another man's child.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.549
Oh. You think that'll make 'em
see what a good guy you are?

11:20.592 --> 11:21.724
Maybe a little.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.943
And you'll look noble.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.596
Well, yeah.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.468
Question.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.776
Once I admit I got knocked up
by a completely different guy,

11:29.819 --> 11:31.560
how will I look?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.738
Yeah, okay.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.174
What's the plan?

We don't speak a word of Junior

with rice.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.747
Yeah, but what if you're showing
before the wedding?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.793
Don't you think people
will have questions?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.796
It's the one upside
to being a big girl.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.320
No one ever dares ask
if you're pregnant.

I work for Rita Castillo.

My condolences.

She called from jail, asked me
to get the photos you took.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.774
I figured as much.

Carlo is a brute.

is that old, you don't kill him,

For murder.

They're saying
she poisoned Carlo.

She actually
went through with it.

some time in the kitchen.

We were in the other room

But then she said that
she had a plan to stop him.

I didn't take it seriously
because she was so...

15:58.783 --> 16:01.134

16:01.177 --> 16:02.962
-Oh.
-Divorce.

-That would explain a lot.
-Yes.

Please don't repeat this.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.359
I would hate
for word to get out.

Everyone in town would think
that Rita is guilty.

Maybe I'm wrong.

I think you're capable
of murder.

But you'd hire some goon
to do it

17:04.719 --> 17:06.416

She wants you to call the judge

from Galveston this is,

out of jail.

talking to Rita,

I will put you in there
with her.

for the guards.

doing in your purse?

How did you know about that?

20:24.266 --> 20:25.876
It wasn't in the papers.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.226
Catherine told me.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.749
She's still speaking to you?

20:28.792 --> 20:30.141
Why wouldn't she be?

20:30.185 --> 20:31.621
Well, I told you
to stop kissing her

20:31.665 --> 20:33.057
once Vern got the photo.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.799
Most women would be offended

by a man pulling away mid-tryst.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.023
Well... that was the plan.

But, well...

20:44.504 --> 20:46.506
-once we got going...
-Wait.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.249
You actually...

20:50.292 --> 20:51.859

20:51.902 --> 20:53.426
Well, at least
I kept her distracted

20:53.469 --> 20:56.037
while you were doing...
whatever.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.821
I did not murder Carlo!

20:58.996 --> 21:00.520
Of course you didn't!

21:00.563 --> 21:03.479
I am very angry
with you right now.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.395
Well, then maybe
I should lay low for a while.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.528
You know, some folks
might consider me a motive.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.399
Are you dumping me?

21:10.443 --> 21:13.097
I-I'm just saying
no more visits in jail.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.622
It makes you look guilty.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.319
And...

21:17.363 --> 21:18.625
maybe me, too.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.279
Maybe.

-Guard.
-Wait.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.780
that you shouldn't be
right on time for dinner.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.347
The hostess
might be running behind.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.218
It's polite to be a bit late.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.177
He's not usually this polite.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.135
[doorbell rings]

21:53.529 --> 21:55.270
Oh, thank God.
I was getting worried.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.576
Sorry.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.273
I was working on a new case.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.927
Mom, Dad, this is Vern.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.232
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you both.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.277
Bertram Fillcot. How are you?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.583
Dee said you liked flowers.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.367
Oh, what lovely blooms.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.630
-Not as pretty as your garden.
-Oh, well...

22:07.674 --> 22:09.284
Flattery will get you
everywhere.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.155
Please, come in, sit down.

22:11.199 --> 22:13.723
Now, I heard you mention to Dee
something about a new case.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.508
What exactly
do you do for a living?

22:15.551 --> 22:17.248
He's a detective.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.686
Oh.

22:19.729 --> 22:20.687
Mom, are you all right?

22:20.730 --> 22:21.905
Yes.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.994
Yes. It's just a little thorn.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.170
Are you with the police?

22:26.214 --> 22:28.129
I used to be, before the war.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.478
Now I'm a private detective.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.175
Oh, a private detective.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.916
Oh, that's much better.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.919
I mean,
it's so much more exciting.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.530
Not too exciting.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.836
Mostly I work missing
persons cases, divorces.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.447
It's how me met.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.492
Vern came into the diner
'cause he was tailing a guy.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.539
Next thing I knew,
I was tailing your daughter.

22:49.455 --> 22:50.804
That sounded creepy, huh?

22:50.847 --> 22:52.153
Yes, a little bit.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.894
I'm going to put these in water.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.635
Bertram, will you help me
in the kitchen?

22:55.678 --> 22:57.158
Yes.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.901
So far, so good.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.511
Hey. What's this new case?

23:02.555 --> 23:04.295
About that...

23:04.339 --> 23:07.560
if I decide to take it,
the fee could buy us a house.

23:07.603 --> 23:08.604
A house?

23:08.648 --> 23:10.563
My God, who's the client?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.173
Well...

23:12.216 --> 23:13.348
ALMA:
Dinner is served!

23:13.392 --> 23:15.742
Thank God. I am starved.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.179
Why aren't you telling me
who the client is?

23:18.222 --> 23:20.355
[stammers] It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.704
You might even laugh about it.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.577
But probably not.

23:27.188 --> 23:29.233
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

23:39.418 --> 23:40.767
We need more rolls.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.203
Just taking a batch
out of the oven.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.683
Put the basket right here.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.036
So?
What do you think about Vern?

23:49.079 --> 23:50.994
I like him.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.692
Such lovely manners.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.085
And the blooms he brought
were well chosen.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.391
Most men haven't a clue.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.784
So, you really like him?

23:57.827 --> 23:59.394
You're not just saying that?

24:00.395 --> 24:01.918
I really like him.

24:03.267 --> 24:06.575
And I hope you'll have
a nice, long engagement.

24:06.619 --> 24:09.230
It'll give your father and I
a chance to get to know him.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.971
Actually...

24:11.014 --> 24:12.929
we wanted to get married
as soon as possible.

24:12.973 --> 24:14.627
[chuckles]

24:14.670 --> 24:16.411
This is marriage, Dee.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.674
It's not something
you just jump into.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.110
Yeah, but...

24:20.154 --> 24:21.590
Dee.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.505
He's not going anywhere.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.159
What's the rush?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.381
BERTRAM:
So, you met Dee at the diner.

24:30.425 --> 24:31.818
Do you, do you live near there?

24:31.861 --> 24:33.733
I have a little place downtown.

24:33.776 --> 24:36.475
But he just got a case so big,
it could buy us a house.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.650
Oh, wonderful.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.042
Who's the client?

24:39.086 --> 24:40.522
-It's too soon to talk about it.
-Oh.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.132
Sounds top secret.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.351
I'll bet it's a movie star.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.874
[chuckles]
No.

24:44.918 --> 24:47.224
No, but you'd earn enough
money to buy a house?

24:47.268 --> 24:49.052
Rich people pay a lot
to get out of jams.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.402
Oh, so it's a rich person
in a jam...

24:51.446 --> 24:53.361
That sounds like a little bit
of a clue, doesn't it?

24:53.404 --> 24:54.623
Hmm.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.972
Is it Rita Castillo?

24:56.016 --> 24:58.018
Uh...

24:59.585 --> 25:00.673
Oh, my God.

25:00.716 --> 25:01.935
It is Rita, isn't it?

25:01.978 --> 25:03.545
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

25:03.589 --> 25:05.329
Why would you work
for her again?

25:05.373 --> 25:06.505
Again?

25:06.548 --> 25:08.115
You've worked for Rita before?

25:08.158 --> 25:09.725
I'm sorry, Mrs. Fillcot.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.335
I know you hate Rita's guts.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.423
What?

25:12.467 --> 25:13.686
[laughing]:
What?

25:13.729 --> 25:14.948
Vern...

25:14.991 --> 25:17.559
Why would you say such a thing?

25:17.603 --> 25:19.343
Well, Dee told me
about your history with Rita.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.302
How she blackballed you
from her Garden Club.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.651
She blackballed you?

25:22.695 --> 25:24.348
And she got me fired
from my job.

25:24.392 --> 25:25.828
VERN:
I don't care for her either.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.526
But she swears
she didn't kill her husband.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.092
She said she was framed.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.137
BERTRAM:
I-I-I'm sorry.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.747
What do you mean framed?

25:31.791 --> 25:33.532
The drug
that killed her husband?

25:33.575 --> 25:35.838
They found a syringe full of it
in her purse.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.361
Huh.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.496
Such morbid talk
for the dinner table.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.194
I hope that when I come back
with dessert,

25:44.238 --> 25:45.544
we can change the subject.

25:51.114 --> 25:55.205
She found my letters?

25:55.249 --> 25:56.206
How?

25:56.250 --> 25:57.512
How do you think?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.296
Catherine broke into my room.

25:59.340 --> 26:02.125
I told you to destroy those
years ago.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.779
Why did you keep them?

26:03.823 --> 26:06.608
You know, for the memories.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.699
You kept them for insurance.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.658
You were scared
I wouldn't give you the money

26:12.701 --> 26:14.398
I promised when Carlo died.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.052
You didn't trust me.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.619
How could I?

26:17.663 --> 26:20.100
You lie all the time.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.276
To your husband, your lovers,

26:22.319 --> 26:23.625
to everyone.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.366
If Catherine has the letters,

26:25.409 --> 26:27.934
how long before she finds out
what we did in Galveston?

26:27.977 --> 26:29.370
You, you have ruined us.

26:29.413 --> 26:30.719
Us?

26:30.763 --> 26:32.242
You're the one
with poison in her purse.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.635
How many times do I have
to tell you I was framed?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.202
[scoffs]

26:37.813 --> 26:39.946
Any theories on who would
have done something like that?

26:41.164 --> 26:42.644
So that's your next move.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.515
You're going to try
to pin this on me?

26:44.559 --> 26:46.909
All I know is I didn't do it.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.563
Well, neither did I.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.086
And you know what?

26:50.130 --> 26:52.001
I ain't sticking around
to find out who did.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.699
Meaning what?

26:53.742 --> 26:56.353
Tomorrow I'm buying
a bus ticket for parts unknown.

26:56.397 --> 26:59.835
What, you're just going
to leave me here to rot?

26:59.879 --> 27:01.228
Catherine's on to us.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.751
I got to get the hell
out of Dodge.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.535
The ingratitude.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.842
I gave you a home, a job.

27:06.886 --> 27:09.671
A job as a maid.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.151
We're blood.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.588
And somewhere along the way,
you forgot that.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.459
Well, I quit.

27:15.503 --> 27:18.245
This is one mess you're going
to have to clean up yourself.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.338
[door closes]

27:24.381 --> 27:26.383
You said that Rita
was your friend.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.820
That she wanted you in the club.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.996
That's what she said,
but she lied.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.737
Is this why you asked me
to kill Carlo?

27:31.780 --> 27:33.303
Now is not the time.

27:33.347 --> 27:37.917
Alma, did you put that syringe
in her purse?

27:37.960 --> 27:40.746
What I did or didn't do
doesn't matter at this point.

27:40.789 --> 27:43.749
What matters is that Dee
is engaged to a man

27:43.792 --> 27:45.576
who wants to prove
Rita is innocent.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.708
But she is innocent.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.014
And we are not.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.145
See the problem?

27:49.189 --> 27:50.494
You deceived me.

27:50.538 --> 27:52.105
You used me as a murder weapon.

27:52.148 --> 27:53.933
Stop whining.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.586
-Get the ice cream.
-[scoffs]

27:56.196 --> 27:59.025
How can you work for Rita after
all she's done to this family?

27:59.068 --> 28:01.941
Well, helping us buy a house
is a nice way to apologize.

28:01.984 --> 28:04.291
God, this night is a disaster.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.727
I know, it's awkward.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.729
But we have to think
about our future

28:07.773 --> 28:09.644
and the home
we want to make for the baby.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.385
Baby?

28:11.428 --> 28:12.821
Oh, boy.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.041
Dee, do you mean to say that...?

28:16.129 --> 28:17.826
Yeah.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.436
I'm pregnant.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.699
-[gasps]
-What?

28:20.742 --> 28:21.743
It's not mine.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.136
[gasping]

28:25.878 --> 28:27.096
Yeah.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.663
That made it less awkward.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.759
[dishes clanking]

28:39.500 --> 28:41.154
Thank you, Vern.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.460
Just put those on the counter,
please.

28:50.859 --> 28:52.774
For what it's worth,

28:52.818 --> 28:55.777
I'm sorry you had to find out
about the baby like that.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.910
We should've told you sooner.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.653
And you don't have to worry.

29:02.697 --> 29:05.744
I plan to take good care
of Dee and the baby.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.487
But I do worry.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.707
[sighs]
Mostly about your job.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.102
My job?

29:16.145 --> 29:18.844
Well, you're
a private detective.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.846
That's dangerous work.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.500
Dee could end up a widow
before her first anniversary.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.154
[chuckling]:
Oh, no.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.113
It's not what it seems like
in the movies.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.856
Don't you investigate
people's secrets?

29:30.899 --> 29:33.641
Expose things they're
desperate to keep hidden?

29:33.684 --> 29:35.164
I guess.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.385
And I assume you carry a gun.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.952
When it's necessary.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.431
So you admit it?

29:41.475 --> 29:42.824
There's risk.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.219
I am not going
to get myself killed.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.916
That's what they all say.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.921
Mrs. Fillcot, being a P.I.
is, is how I make my living.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.315
Why not drive a taxi?

29:55.358 --> 29:56.925
Or work in a factory?

29:56.969 --> 30:00.494
There are safer ways
to bring home a paycheck.

30:01.495 --> 30:02.931
Are you asking me
to quit my job?

30:02.975 --> 30:05.107
Oh, Vern.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.587
You're asking me

30:06.630 --> 30:09.329
to bless this hasty union
with my daughter.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.940
And she's pregnant
with another man's child?

30:11.984 --> 30:13.942
[scoffs]

30:13.986 --> 30:17.206
A little compromise makes
for happier families.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.253
Don't you agree?

30:28.130 --> 30:30.393
Thank you for coming by.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.874
-You sounded upset on the phone.
-I am.

30:32.918 --> 30:35.094
Something unpleasant
came to my attention.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.270
It involves Rita and me...

30:37.313 --> 30:39.402
and you as well.

30:40.664 --> 30:41.840
Me?

30:41.883 --> 30:44.320
The night Papa died,

30:44.364 --> 30:46.888
when we came back here and...
you know.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.368
What about it?

30:48.411 --> 30:51.197
It appears there were
photographs taken.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.114
Of us.

30:55.157 --> 30:56.463
Undressed.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.508
Listen, uh,
about those photos...

30:58.552 --> 31:00.336
You knew about them?

31:00.380 --> 31:01.685
Well, yeah.

31:01.729 --> 31:02.991
When Rita came to me, I...

31:03.035 --> 31:05.428
She tried to blackmail you, too?

31:07.343 --> 31:09.389
She sure did.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.217
I'm so sorry.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.088
I didn't know
she had us followed.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.177
She's sneaky, that one.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.918
No, she's hateful.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.964
You know,
one thing is to attack me,

31:19.007 --> 31:21.923
but to drag an innocent young
man into her vendetta...

31:21.967 --> 31:23.229
Eh.

31:23.272 --> 31:24.708
What ya gonna do?

31:24.752 --> 31:27.668
So, do you really think
she killed Carlo?

31:27.711 --> 31:30.410
Well, if not her, then who?

31:30.453 --> 31:32.368
That's what I keep wondering.

31:34.022 --> 31:38.287
So... you're not angry at me?

31:38.331 --> 31:39.462
At you?

31:39.506 --> 31:41.421
No. We're golden.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.379
Oh.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.468
I'm so glad.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.731
You know, our maid quit today.

31:47.775 --> 31:50.734
And with Papa gone
and Rita in jail...

31:51.735 --> 31:54.260
I'm going to be all by myself
in this cold,

31:54.303 --> 31:56.349
empty house.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.133
And I wouldn't mind it so much

31:58.177 --> 31:59.743
if you were here

31:59.787 --> 32:01.789
to keep me company.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.271
Are you asking me to move in?

32:05.314 --> 32:06.750
Here?

32:06.794 --> 32:09.753
I need a reason to get up
in the mornings.

32:10.624 --> 32:14.193
And it would be very nice
to have someone to take care of.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.720
Well...

32:19.763 --> 32:22.462
I sure wouldn't
want you to be lonely.

32:22.505 --> 32:23.724
Oh.

32:23.767 --> 32:27.032
Thank you, my darling boy.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.992
Hey, you're cold.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.385
Let me start you a fire.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.343
Oh, Scooter.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.954
You already have.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.087
-DEE: Thanks, Mom.
-VERN: Thank you.
-Night.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.350
-Of course. Drive safely.
-Take care.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.874
[Vern exhales sharply]

32:43.918 --> 32:45.572
Saw you talking to my mom
in the kitchen.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.095
What was that all about?

32:48.140 --> 32:49.793
She wants me
to stop being a detective.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.230
What?

32:51.273 --> 32:53.493
She's worried I'll get shot
by a crook,

32:53.536 --> 32:54.755
and you'll be a widow.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.757
Oh, geez.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.325
So, what does she think
you'll do for a living?

32:59.368 --> 33:02.806
-She suggested I drive a taxi.
-Hmm.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.201
I'd rather sleep
with a private detective.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.724
Well...

33:07.768 --> 33:09.117
that settles that.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.206
[both laughing]

33:13.643 --> 33:16.081
You know, it... it's funny.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.126
Your mom didn't seem
to mind my job at first.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.910
Yeah.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.956
She only got weird when
you said you might help Rita.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.480
Considering what Rita did
to you and your mom,

33:24.524 --> 33:26.265
maybe I shouldn't take the case.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.832
Do you think Rita is innocent?

33:28.876 --> 33:30.747
I do.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.620
Then take the job.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.317
Are you sure?

33:35.361 --> 33:37.537
We got a baby on the way.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.453
And if Rita's willing
to pay top dollar...

33:40.496 --> 33:42.411
But what about your mom?

33:42.455 --> 33:44.761
I want her to like me.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.111
Honey.

33:46.154 --> 33:48.591
She's going to be
your mother-in-law.

33:48.635 --> 33:49.984
She will never like you.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.340
This evening was certainly
full of surprises.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.125
Don't you think?

34:02.866 --> 34:04.390
Are you going to sulk all night?

34:05.652 --> 34:07.654
You trick me into killing
Rita's husband.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.352
Then you have the nerve
to complain that I'm sulking?

34:11.571 --> 34:13.094
Why, Alma?

34:13.138 --> 34:14.574
Why did you do it?

34:15.662 --> 34:17.185
I told you.

34:17.229 --> 34:18.839
Rita was cruel to me.

34:18.882 --> 34:21.233
[scoffs] There's got to be
more to it than that.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.411
When you're able to explain
your shocking conduct,

34:25.454 --> 34:27.152
come down to the sofa.

34:27.195 --> 34:28.805
Explain it to me there.

34:28.849 --> 34:31.069
That's where
I'll be sleeping tonight.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.400
Mr. Loomis?

34:58.444 --> 34:59.967
It's 6:00 in the morning.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.229
What are you doing here
so early?

35:01.273 --> 35:03.405
I owe you one, Frank.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.147
-You got five minutes.
-That's all I need.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.018
I'm going to take your case.

35:08.062 --> 35:10.586
Wonderful.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.414
I didn't think you would.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.199
I know you don't think
much of me.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.288
I don't got to like you
to think you're innocent.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.767
Thank you.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.421
So...

35:19.465 --> 35:21.902
I'm going to need a list
of all your enemies.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.512
All of 'em?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.124
Oh, honey.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.039
You're going to need
more than five minutes.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.005
[doorbell rings]

35:40.964 --> 35:43.358
Hi.
Oh, I hope it's not too early.

35:43.402 --> 35:44.620
Not at all.

35:44.664 --> 35:45.839
May I come in?

35:45.882 --> 35:47.406
Oh, uh...

35:47.449 --> 35:49.059
-My house is a mess.
-Oh.

35:49.103 --> 35:51.366
-Let's, let's talk out here.
-Oh, all right.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.368
[clears throat]

35:53.412 --> 35:55.805
-[chuckles nervously]
-Oh, Alma.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.459
I just...

35:57.503 --> 36:00.767
I wanted you to know
the whole club feels terribly

36:00.810 --> 36:03.117
about the way Rita treated you.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.686
Promising you a spot and then
stabbing you in the back.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.905
I'm sure she had her reasons.

36:08.949 --> 36:10.298
Be that as it may,

36:10.342 --> 36:12.996
there may be room
for a new member soon.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.476
Oh?

36:14.520 --> 36:16.957
Now, Rita is innocent
until proven guilty.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.393
But...

36:18.437 --> 36:20.482
this whole scandal
is just so salacious

36:20.526 --> 36:23.224
that some of the ladies
want her out right now.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.791
Oh.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.445
Oh, poor Rita.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.490
That is so like you, Alma.

36:28.534 --> 36:31.014
Defending her, even now.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.712
Well...

36:32.755 --> 36:35.497
Well, if she is removed,

36:35.541 --> 36:37.934
I plan to nominate you again.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.589
And this time
I won't fail to get those votes.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.330
That is...

36:42.374 --> 36:45.203
if you'd still want
to be a part of our silly club.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.552
I do.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.380
I really do.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.251
Oh, good.

36:50.295 --> 36:51.731
Well, I'll let you know

36:51.774 --> 36:53.559
as soon as we make a decision
about Rita.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.430
You're so kind
to think of me, Grace.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.650
Well, someone has to think
of you, Alma.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.042
You never think of yourself.

36:59.086 --> 37:00.043
Well...

37:00.087 --> 37:01.567
[both sigh]

37:01.610 --> 37:03.482
[both giggle]

37:12.317 --> 37:13.753
Oh.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.233
You're up.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.451
That was Grace.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.845
-She told me...
-I heard.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.761
You don't seem
very happy for me.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.502
That was the plan
all along, wasn't it?

37:23.545 --> 37:25.155
Why a man is dead

37:25.199 --> 37:27.157
and his wife is in jail
for murder.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.247
All so you could
get into a garden club?

37:30.291 --> 37:32.119
I don't pretend to be perfect.

37:32.162 --> 37:33.425
Jesus, Alma.

37:33.468 --> 37:36.254
Bertie... remind me.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.386
Why did you kill
all those people?

37:38.430 --> 37:40.780
I have told you a hundred times,

37:40.823 --> 37:43.391
they were suffering
from disease.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.480
And because you couldn't cure
the disease,

37:45.524 --> 37:47.047
you killed the patient.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.309
In order to protect them.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.790
What if you had the cure?

37:51.791 --> 37:54.141
What if you could have kept
the patient alive?

37:54.184 --> 37:55.577
What are you talking about?

37:55.621 --> 37:58.667
Rita was my disease.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.626
She was a tumor,

38:00.669 --> 38:02.976
causing me no end of pain,

38:03.019 --> 38:04.804
agony.

38:05.805 --> 38:07.459
So I had her removed.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.156
It's not the same thing.

38:09.199 --> 38:12.333
There's so much suffering
in the world.

38:12.377 --> 38:15.510
Because of cruelty
and unkindness.

38:15.554 --> 38:18.339
Rich, beautiful people
with power,

38:18.383 --> 38:21.690
humiliating weak nobodies
who displease them.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.259
Rita thought I was weak.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.043
And so did I.

38:27.087 --> 38:28.654
But you...

38:29.872 --> 38:32.832
...you taught me
that we all have power.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.704
If only we're brave enough
to use it.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.490
Alma, you framed
an innocent woman

38:38.533 --> 38:40.056
for a murder she didn't commit.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.668
I prevented suffering.

38:42.711 --> 38:45.235
That's how you justify
your crimes.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.586
I can justify mine
in exactly the same way.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.457
You've lost your mind.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.812
We're about to be grandparents.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.815
Let's just put all this
unpleasantness behind us

38:59.859 --> 39:01.643
and enjoy this happy time.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.166
Hmm?

39:19.792 --> 39:21.576
Here you go.

39:24.274 --> 39:25.928
How many days are you with us?

39:25.972 --> 39:27.321
Just the night.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.888
I'm taking the noon bus
out of town.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.281
Okay. Well, I'll get the towels.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.938
[sighs]

39:38.245 --> 39:39.942
Oh.

39:53.565 --> 39:56.176
♪

40:11.670 --> 40:13.411
[knock on door]

40:16.501 --> 40:17.850
Here's your towels.

40:19.242 --> 40:20.940
I may need a few more.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.856
I just decided to stay in town
a couple more days.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.597
Oh? What changed your mind?

40:25.640 --> 40:30.645
A promising business opportunity
has just presented itself.
