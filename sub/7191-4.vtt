just about Jax.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.947
Or maybe it was about her
missing that date

18:35.030 --> 18:36.365
the other night.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.201
Or the Mr. Alonso
birthday party disaster.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.037
- I didn't hear about
a birthday party disaster.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.873
- Oh, yeah, well, before,
it was bad when Mr. Alonso

18:44.957 --> 18:46.375
wanted Emma to break up
with Daniel,

18:46.458 --> 18:47.876
but now he kind of wants
to throw him off a boat

18:47.960 --> 18:50.170
and feed him to sharks.
