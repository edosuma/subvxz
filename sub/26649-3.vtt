WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.100 --> 00:15.533
Let this motherfucking party
begin!

00:15.600 --> 00:19.033
This time,
we are back where we belong.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.233
Newcastle!

00:21.567 --> 00:22.967
With our friends.

00:23.033 --> 00:24.500
And family.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.733
Woo-hoo!
Nanna!

00:27.800 --> 00:29.900
Doing the things we love.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.867
There'll be some new faces...
Hello!

00:35.933 --> 00:37.900
Plenty of old faces...

00:37.967 --> 00:40.200
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

00:40.267 --> 00:43.367
And one big blast from the past!

00:43.433 --> 00:46.933
Long time no fuckin' see!
(cheering, screaming)

00:47.000 --> 00:48.633
But don't worry...

00:48.700 --> 00:51.600
We're still proper radge.

00:51.667 --> 00:54.667
Which means getting inebriated!

00:54.733 --> 00:56.067
You mean mortal?

00:58.100 --> 01:00.700
Lots of fornication.

01:00.767 --> 01:02.533
Shagging, you divvie!

01:03.567 --> 01:04.967
Hello!

01:05.033 --> 01:06.567
And lots and lots of mayhem.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.500
(shouts)

01:08.567 --> 01:11.700
(screaming)

01:11.767 --> 01:13.633
Fuck off! (yells)

01:20.433 --> 01:23.200
Shut your fucking mouth!
(cheering)

01:23.267 --> 01:25.267
Gonna be pure fuckin' belter!

01:25.333 --> 01:27.867
(explosion, yelling)

01:29.100 --> 01:31.867
It's so good to catch up with
James.

01:31.933 --> 01:34.967
Wow, the Geordie vibe's
still going strong.

01:35.933 --> 01:39.333
Showing our home to everybody
has
made me feel closer to Chloe

01:39.400 --> 01:40.933
than I ever have before.

01:41.033 --> 01:42.567
(yells)

01:42.633 --> 01:45.367
There's nothing I love more
than a massive pole.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.200
(laughs)

01:47.267 --> 01:49.333
Every night I just say
a little prayer.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.167
Discussing my religion with
Chloe,
she seems genuinely interested.

01:53.233 --> 01:55.000
Hello! Have you finally had sex?

01:55.067 --> 01:58.267
I just don't get Faith.
She refused to watch Nathan,

01:58.333 --> 02:01.033
but last night she's watching
me and Sam have sex.

02:01.100 --> 02:03.833
I dare you to deep throat.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.633
I wanna know if Faith
is just like the rest of wuh.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.067
Fuck yous all. Whatever.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.267
I thought Chloe and I
were getting along.

02:10.333 --> 02:11.800
I'm not gonna do it.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.567
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.533
I'm preened to perfection.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.500
I'm tanned, toned,
and ready to tash on.

02:20.567 --> 02:23.400
I'm a lad whose got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:23.467 --> 02:26.200
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:26.267 --> 02:29.400
I'm happy-go-lucky, bit of
a jack the lad. That's me to a
tee.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.967
I'm fit, flirty,
and I've got double-F's.

02:32.033 --> 02:34.700
What you see is what you get.
Bags of fun.

02:34.767 --> 02:37.733
I cannae believe
would put me in charge of this
lot.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.367
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:55.000 --> 02:56.833
Mornin'!
Mornin', lovely.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.267
Mornin', Abbie!
Mornin'.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.567
You look rough this morning.
Thanks!

03:00.633 --> 03:03.000
Faith, how are you feeling?

03:03.067 --> 03:05.800
I really appreciated
that you came and talked to us.

03:05.867 --> 03:08.167
Chloe could've went around it
a better way.

03:08.233 --> 03:10.467
She wasn't letting me
get my point across.

03:10.533 --> 03:11.667
I feel bad for Faith.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.300
Last night, Chloe went in on her
for not joining in

03:14.367 --> 03:16.233
and she ended up in absolute
tears.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.233
I think you need to be honest
and if you aren't all right,

03:19.300 --> 03:22.133
you need to say,
"Look, I'm not all right." Yeah.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.467
I am new to the family

03:23.533 --> 03:26.300
and it is gonna take us
a little bit more time to fit
in.

03:26.367 --> 03:29.433
But I'm still really shocked
the way Chloe spoke to us.

03:29.500 --> 03:33.033
I've felt like that before
and it's an awful feeling.

03:33.100 --> 03:36.467
But I think it's good it's
happened
cos at least we all know now,

03:36.533 --> 03:38.800
and we're still getting to know
you.
Yeah.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.367
And vice versa as well.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.300
Right.
Chloe had a little bit of a
spat.

03:46.367 --> 03:47.433
Who with?
Faith.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.633
We're playing a game of
sucking the dick.

03:49.700 --> 03:53.333
I went, "Oh, go on, Faith, I
wanna
see what your techniques are."

03:53.400 --> 03:54.667
"Nah, don't do that."

03:54.733 --> 03:58.133
When Faith was trying to
explain,
Chloe kept screaming at her,

03:58.200 --> 04:00.567
"Why won't you do it?
Why won't you do it?"

04:00.633 --> 04:04.400
The one night I go to bed early
and there's fucking hell on.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.467
I just wanna know,
why won't you do it?

04:06.533 --> 04:08.867
But then Faith got really upset.
Really?

04:08.933 --> 04:10.300
Yeah, and she cried.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.967
Me and Faith haven't spoken
since last night.

04:14.033 --> 04:16.899
I don't regret what I said,
but just how I said it.

04:16.966 --> 04:19.267
Hello.
Mornin', me love.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.533
How are you, pet?
Ill.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.633
Are you hungover?
Yeah. Rough a little bit.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.600
'It's awkward as fuck in here.'

04:28.667 --> 04:31.433
'Chloe and Faith
haven't even looked at each
other.'

04:31.500 --> 04:34.933
The boys are getting on like a
house
on fire, but the girls aren't.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.700
We need to get away so we can
bond.

04:36.767 --> 04:39.867
I've got a really good idea
for all of us girls. (Abbie)
What?

04:39.933 --> 04:42.567
I think we should go on
a girls' trip!

04:42.633 --> 04:44.400
(both) Yay!

04:44.467 --> 04:46.200
Where?
Mexico?

04:46.267 --> 04:48.800
Very, very similar to Mexico.
Is it tropical?

04:48.867 --> 04:52.200
Yep... Blackpool!

04:52.267 --> 04:54.500
There's tension between
me and Chloe,

04:54.567 --> 04:57.333
but I'm not gonna let it
get in the way of a mint trip.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.333
It's so good, isn't it?
It's so good.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.300
Let's get packing!

05:01.367 --> 05:04.733
Blackpool is a perfect place
for Chloe and Faith to make up.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.033
But it's also a perfect place
for me to spend time with Chloe,

05:08.100 --> 05:10.000
because she's always with Sam.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.900
I need to go and tell Sam.

05:17.267 --> 05:19.500
I'm going away on a girls' trip.
Where to?

05:19.567 --> 05:22.967
Blackpool.
Oh, it's fucking mint there!

05:23.033 --> 05:24.500
Have you been before?
Nah.

05:24.567 --> 05:26.333
It's like a little girl holiday.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.267
Since moving in with Sam,
we have been un-seperable.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.467
I'm excited to spend time
with the girls,

05:31.533 --> 05:33.633
but I'm worried how much
I'll miss him.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.967
I'm jealous.
Are ya?

05:35.033 --> 05:37.767
Honestly, yeah.
I'm gonna go get ready. Goodbye.

05:37.833 --> 05:41.500
I hope Chloe's not away for too
long. I miss her after one day.

05:41.567 --> 05:45.933
You need to look after rat
babies.
Donald and Teresa. (laughs)

05:51.167 --> 05:52.567
I'm not being funny,

05:52.633 --> 05:56.567
but I think Faith must have
mixed up
her clothes with her nan's.

06:01.267 --> 06:03.700
Three lads, no girls...

06:03.767 --> 06:05.367
One cup.
(groans)

06:05.433 --> 06:08.933
Oh, why do you always spoil it?
(laughter)

06:09.000 --> 06:11.633
(phone rings)
Who is it?!

06:11.700 --> 06:14.167
The phone is ringing.
We all know who this is.

06:14.233 --> 06:16.300
We better not be going to work.

06:16.367 --> 06:18.233
"Hello, Nathan."
Hello, Scott.

06:18.300 --> 06:22.200
"Listen, kid. I need you and two
of
them divvies to go to work
today."

06:22.267 --> 06:25.200
"I cannae make it, mate,
cos I am already chokka."

06:25.267 --> 06:27.067
Right, OK. I'll take the two
lads.

06:27.133 --> 06:30.633
"Yous are going coasteering,
and din forget your swimming
trunks

06:30.700 --> 06:33.467
or your mankini, you big dork."
All right.

06:33.533 --> 06:34.900
I don't mind going to work,

06:34.967 --> 06:38.900
but it's the fact that it's
Scott and
not Anna that I'm now working
for.

06:38.967 --> 06:42.000
Get our swim gear on
cos we're going coasteering.
What?

06:42.067 --> 06:43.467
I don't fucking know!

06:43.533 --> 06:46.767
Don't know what coasteering is.
I hope it involves drink.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.433
Girls on the trolleys!

06:48.500 --> 06:50.533
Are yous all going to a funeral?
Yours.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.733
Sorry, but what the hell is
Faith
wearing? Is she a washer woman?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.933
Are yous gonna miss us?
Fuck off! Get out!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Right.
Bye!

06:59.067 --> 07:02.900
We are buzzin' for this trip.
But
I can't believe the boys'
reaction.

07:02.967 --> 07:06.133
I thought they'd be a lot more
pissed off. Get out now!

07:06.200 --> 07:08.667
Fuck off!
Go on! See yas!

07:08.733 --> 07:11.967
(all cheering)

07:16.067 --> 07:18.500
We are Blackpool, you know.
Riff-raff, innit?

07:18.567 --> 07:21.233
We're rough, we're ready,
we love fuckin' sea,

07:21.300 --> 07:23.833
we love the sand, we love
partyin'.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.133
I'm really lookin' forward to
getting my girls back on track.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.867
I'm determined to make this trip
one to remember.

07:29.933 --> 07:33.233
We're gonna have such a good
time.
I just want to have fun.

07:34.267 --> 07:37.200
Fuckin' hell, yous don't do
fuck all. You got it easy.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.933
Don't be doing nothing I
wouldn't.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.600
Come on, little chickens!

07:41.667 --> 07:43.467
Can't wait for a day out with
us.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.533
You can't wait
for a day out with me.

07:49.467 --> 07:51.533
Aw, it's gonna be fuckin' cold.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.933
Me and the lads are buzzing
for coasteering.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.933
Even though none of us
know what it is.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.167
All Scott said was, "Bring your
trunks and go to the beach."

07:59.233 --> 08:02.400
Size of that cow.
That's a cow? It's orange!

08:02.467 --> 08:05.433
Fuck me, that's not a cow.
Moo!

08:05.500 --> 08:08.567
Look at the goat!
That's not a goat, it's a cow!

08:08.633 --> 08:12.700
We don't know what this Georday
Tours
is, but we're gonna get wet.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.600
I need you to down there
and readjust my dick. Fuck off.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.067
There's no time for me
to rearrange your knob.

08:18.133 --> 08:19.833
We need to get to graft.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.600
Coasteering is about the most
fun
you can have without dying.
Great.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.900
If I told you I put an
82-year-old
in here, what would you say?

08:26.967 --> 08:30.167
How many years did you get for
that?
(laughter)

08:30.233 --> 08:33.366
I really don't want to do this,
but the boys are egging me on.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.467
If I want to be a lad,
I've got to do it.

08:35.533 --> 08:38.967
(screams)
(laughs)

08:39.033 --> 08:41.767
It's so fucking cold,
my cock has shrivelled away.

08:41.832 --> 08:45.467
If you do that on a hangover,
I swear to God, instant gone.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.200
Get down!
Down!

08:47.267 --> 08:49.967
(laughs)
Get off me, I can't swim!

08:52.567 --> 08:54.033
(indistinct)

09:00.167 --> 09:04.033
I know none of the girls would
have
done what we've done today.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.367
So now I do feel like
one of the lads.

09:06.433 --> 09:10.433
How on earth have we been sent
here
to do that for work? Exactly.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.100
I've never had so much fun
in my life. It was unreal.

09:13.167 --> 09:14.800
That was fucking amazing.

09:14.867 --> 09:17.633
Anna should definitely use that
for Georday Tours.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.633
Let's get back to the house
and get ready for tonight.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.467
Erm, that way.
Are you sure? Yep.

09:29.167 --> 09:32.333
Oh! That stinks, Abbie!
Oh, Abbie.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.800
That is worse than mine.
That is disgusting.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.433
It's cos I've had dairy.

09:36.500 --> 09:40.567
We've arrived at the B&B,
and this place screams
Blackpool.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.800
The other guests are gonna love
us.

09:42.867 --> 09:46.067
Let's go and see what
Blackpool's
about. I need a poo!

09:46.133 --> 09:49.867
Keep it down, guys. We don't
want to
be thrown out before we've
unpacked.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.967
(all shouting)

09:53.733 --> 09:57.600
Who needs Ibiza? Who needs
Magaluf
when you've got this on our
doorstep?

09:59.167 --> 10:01.500
To the girls!
(all cheering)

10:01.567 --> 10:02.967
Bye!
(man shouts)

10:03.033 --> 10:05.667
Come on, girls!
(all cheering)

10:09.800 --> 10:11.067
Ohh!

10:11.133 --> 10:13.833
I'm shit at this.

10:13.900 --> 10:18.067
Faith, shall we go on the
dodgems?
I'm up for that, I love the
dodgems.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.200
Go.

10:19.267 --> 10:20.967
Time to get down to business.

10:21.033 --> 10:23.467
I brought the girls here
to sort their shit out,

10:23.533 --> 10:26.133
and we aren't leaving
until it's sorted.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.900
How do you feel about Faith
today?
You seem like yous are getting
on.

10:29.967 --> 10:33.567
My problem is, is don't come in
here
and be something you're not.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.533
I get that,
but you haven't said anything
wrong.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.500
You've just been a lot more
outspoken, not a bad thing.

10:39.567 --> 10:42.400
I don't want to argue.
I'm having the best time ever

10:42.467 --> 10:44.733
The trip is amazing.
Yeah. So sort it out.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.433
I do feel bad about the way I
spoke
to Faith, but I'm still so
confused.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.867
One minute she's radge as the
rest of wuh, and the next she's
not.

10:51.933 --> 10:53.400
Who is Faith?

10:53.467 --> 10:56.533
I'm ready to play the dodgems.
Howay, let's go. Howay then!

10:58.867 --> 11:00.500
Woo!

11:00.567 --> 11:02.400
(both cheering)

11:02.467 --> 11:05.333
Your tits are gonna fly out.
(yells)

11:05.400 --> 11:08.267
Why is everyone going for me?!
(laughs)

11:10.000 --> 11:13.167
I'm loving it. This is
my best first girl trip ever.

11:13.233 --> 11:14.633
A good time to come away.

11:14.700 --> 11:17.433
I'm having a great time
in Blackpool,

11:17.500 --> 11:20.367
but I hope this issue with Chloe
gets solved soon.

11:20.433 --> 11:22.800
I would hate a night out
with any animosity.

11:22.867 --> 11:26.233
I am apprehensive because
me and Chloe haven't talked
about

11:26.300 --> 11:29.467
what happened last night.
Is there an issue that you have?

11:29.533 --> 11:31.467
If you don't like it,
you can tell us.

11:31.533 --> 11:35.267
Some people are happier
doing some thing's others
aren't.

11:35.333 --> 11:39.567
Like sucking a dildo. That's not
something I feel comfortable
doing.

11:39.633 --> 11:43.200
I think all it was at first was,
everything that we were doing,

11:43.267 --> 11:45.500
you were saying "no,"
and we thought,

11:45.567 --> 11:48.600
"Why doesn't she want to get
involved and have a laugh?"

11:48.667 --> 11:50.933
I think that's why Chloe
said what she did.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.667
Have a chat with her.
I will.

11:52.733 --> 11:55.000
Get that bit of closure
on what's gone on.

11:55.067 --> 11:59.000
I'm glad we've had a chat, and I
understand where she's coming
from.

11:59.067 --> 12:02.067
But she just needs to let
her hair down and have some fun.

12:02.133 --> 12:03.567
(screams)

12:03.633 --> 12:06.600
Right, girls.
Let's get some fucking sausage!

12:09.900 --> 12:11.733
(seagulls squawking)

12:11.800 --> 12:13.733
(all) Thank you!

12:13.800 --> 12:15.700
I always pull it out the bag.

12:15.767 --> 12:19.700
When I said that we're gonna go
on a girls' trip, I fuckin'
meant it.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.767
Chloe, you've lost your sausage!

12:21.833 --> 12:23.567
(both laugh)

12:23.633 --> 12:25.000
Is that a joke?!

12:25.067 --> 12:28.133
I can't believe I dropped
my hot dog. I'm fuckin'
starving.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.167
Today is all about the girls.
Right.

12:31.233 --> 12:34.067
But it's a bit about me as
well...
(all scream)

12:34.133 --> 12:35.633
(laughs) Fuck!

12:35.700 --> 12:37.033
We're getting attacked!

12:37.100 --> 12:39.267
The seagulls over here
are fuckin' radge.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.700
Let's get to the B&B
and get ready for tonight.

12:41.767 --> 12:44.200
(screams)

12:51.900 --> 12:54.367
Give us a twirl.
I look like a traffic cone.

12:54.433 --> 12:56.400
Being away from Sam is all
right.

12:56.467 --> 12:59.833
I do miss him a little bit, but
tonight I'm gonna go fucking
wild.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.333
When Sam's not around, I am
crazy.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.567
I think you're gonna be...
I can feel it.

13:04.633 --> 13:06.000
Tonight is the night.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.300
I'm glad that Sam's
not here tonight,

13:08.367 --> 13:10.733
cos Chloe is gonna be out
in full force.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.600
Come on, let's go.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.133
Blackpool is fuckin' mad, isn't
it?

13:17.633 --> 13:20.667
I can see that the old Chloe
is out with us tonight.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.600
Can you fit into that, Nathan?

13:22.667 --> 13:24.933
Nathan is a fuckin' legend.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.433
Don't fuckin' touch me.
Sam, how dare you!

13:27.500 --> 13:29.733
Fuck off, now!

13:29.800 --> 13:32.833
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:35.000 --> 13:35.200
.

13:37.700 --> 13:37.900
.

13:46.567 --> 13:49.500
The state of that.
Looks like someone's face fell
off.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.667
Yeah, your fuckin' girlfriend.
Whey-hey!

13:52.733 --> 13:56.100
No wonder I've got no clothing.
All in Chloe's fuckin' suitcase.

13:56.167 --> 13:58.200
I'm trying to play it cool.

13:58.267 --> 14:02.167
I know it's not been that long,
but
I do miss her just... a little
bit.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.200
Reckon you'd fit into that,
Nathan?

14:04.267 --> 14:08.267
Probably. Let me dress you
to see if Adam finds you
attractive.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.000
Well, I probably will.

14:10.067 --> 14:13.800
The boys are missing the girls
and asking me to wear their
clothing.

14:13.867 --> 14:17.833
Don't rip it! How do you get it
off?
You might have to go out like
that.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.467
Am I fuck!
(laughter)

14:20.533 --> 14:24.033
I have never in my life
seen anything so funny.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.500
Nathan is a fuckin' legend.

14:26.567 --> 14:29.100
What would I need to do
for you to go out like that?

14:29.167 --> 14:31.600
You cannae. He looks a right
wanker.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.033
(laughter)
Howay, man.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.500
Are you wearing it? One, two,
three.
Yes.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.000
(both cheering)

14:37.067 --> 14:40.167
I'm wearing this dress,
partly cos I can't get out of
it.

14:40.233 --> 14:43.167
But mainly because I'm having
so much fun with the lads.

14:43.233 --> 14:45.367
Let's get ready. Let's get
ready.

14:54.533 --> 14:57.300
We arrive to the club
and it's absolutely bouncing.

14:57.367 --> 14:58.733
But I'm apprehensive

14:58.800 --> 15:01.367
cos me and Chloe haven't spoke
since last night.

15:14.300 --> 15:17.633
Being in a good relationship
means
when I'm not with Sam,

15:17.700 --> 15:19.767
I can have a wicked time
with the girls.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.400
Woo!

15:42.167 --> 15:45.000
We've arrived at the club,
and the tunes are banging.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.800
Let's get lads' night started.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.300
Having Nathan here is wicked.

15:57.367 --> 16:00.500
He might be wearing a skirt
but he's fitting in with the
lads.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.700
I know wearing this dress
was for lads' banter,

16:06.767 --> 16:09.700
but I'm starting to think
it was a bad idea.

16:09.767 --> 16:12.433
I'm starting to get
a load of unwanted attention.

16:32.067 --> 16:34.267
Oh, my God, Chloe never does
shots.

16:34.333 --> 16:37.200
I can see that the old Chloe
is out with us tonight.

16:49.667 --> 16:53.833
I brought the girls here to
bond. If
Chloe and Faith want to sort it
out,

16:53.900 --> 16:56.033
they've got to be honest
with each other.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.700
I'm so used to living
with just my mam.

17:10.767 --> 17:13.032
Moving into a house
with loads of people

17:13.099 --> 17:15.367
is a lot harder
than I expected it to be.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.967
Coming in as a newbie can't be
easy,
but in this house,

17:30.033 --> 17:31.767
you've just got to be strong.

17:45.700 --> 17:46.967
I know it's lads' night,

17:47.033 --> 17:50.200
but I'm chatting to this bird
and she's an absolute stunner.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.833
Adam has just started talking
to a girl, Laura.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.467
We've known her for years.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.733
This girl's got great banter,

18:11.800 --> 18:14.733
and she's not put off
that I've never had a
girlfriend.

18:22.533 --> 18:26.933
Oh, Adam, I didn't put a dress
on for
you to fuck off and chat to
birds.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.667
This is meant to be a lads'
night.

18:44.700 --> 18:48.700
I'm loving getting hammered with
Chloe. I've got my old mate
back.

18:51.067 --> 18:52.933
Chloe keep telling us to be
myself,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.600
but I don't feel like
she's always herself.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.533
She's different when Sam's
around.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.133
Faith has cornered me in the
club
and wants a chat.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.700
I'm gonna apologise to her.
I just hope to God this goes
well.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.667
Fair enough, Chloe has
apologised.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.600
But I do want to make it clear
how much upset she made us.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.700
Usually when you say sorry
to someone, they accept it.

20:08.767 --> 20:11.833
But no, not Faith.
She's like a dog with a bone.

20:17.733 --> 20:20.500
I followed Sophie's advice
but it made things worse.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.700
I feel like I just can't win
with this lot.

20:30.867 --> 20:33.933
I don't know if Chloe and Faith
sorted things out,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.767
but the girls are wasted and I
need
to get them back to the B&B.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.167
The boys are ruining my night.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.667
Wearing this dress
was a joke between us lads,

20:52.733 --> 20:54.567
and now they're taking it too
far.

21:09.067 --> 21:11.233
That was only meant to be a
joke.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.567
This has gone pear shaped.
We need to leave.

21:13.633 --> 21:16.833
Don't touch us.
Don't fuckin' touch me.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.933
Sam, how fuckin' dare you?
That's it, I'm going
full-Nathan.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.433
Are you fuckin' mad?!

21:23.500 --> 21:27.267
Sam, fuck off, now! Fuck off,
now!

21:34.167 --> 21:38.500
We're all back at the B&B,
and tonight has been wicked.

21:38.567 --> 21:41.900
And we are all mortal.
Especially our Chloe.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.133
(shrieks)
What ya doing?

21:46.200 --> 21:47.367
Gonna be sick.

21:47.433 --> 21:49.500
I knew tonight I'd go radge,

21:49.567 --> 21:53.067
but the fresh air of Blackpool
has
done something to us. I am
fucked.

21:53.133 --> 21:56.000
There she is.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.600
We've got back to the house and
I'm still fuming with Adam and
Sam.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.100
They shouldn't have embarrassed
us
like that.

22:13.167 --> 22:16.333
I can't take you serious cos
you're... I don't fuckin' care.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.633
Don't.
What?

22:18.700 --> 22:20.567
(mumbles)

22:20.633 --> 22:23.300
(laughter)

22:23.367 --> 22:26.033
You cannae even get your words
out!

22:26.100 --> 22:28.233
You're public enemy number one.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.967
Adam and Sam don't have the
balls
to wear a dress out to the club,

22:32.033 --> 22:35.500
let alone stand there laughing
at me.
They can both fuck off.

22:35.567 --> 22:38.933
Sam, you rip the clothes off me
and you made me leave the club.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.067
Nathan, you left the club
like this... In a PVC dress!

22:43.133 --> 22:45.733
Like you were fuckin' Celine
Dion,
giving it this.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.867
Firstly, Celine Dion is not
iconic.

22:48.933 --> 22:51.133
Celine Dion? Fuck off.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.800
You had the choice.
You had the choice. Yes! Sam...

22:54.867 --> 22:57.300
I can't believe...
Laura's came back with us,

22:57.367 --> 22:59.967
and in the heat of an argument,
I forget about her.

23:00.033 --> 23:02.833
I'm glad she didn't do one
when Nathan was goin' off.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.900
You go on the right,
I go on the left, my lucky side.

23:10.433 --> 23:13.667
Nathan's gone to the girls'
room.
I was only having a laugh.

23:13.733 --> 23:15.500
Maybe I did take it too far.

23:18.900 --> 23:21.067
Tonight was going so well,

23:21.133 --> 23:25.033
and I can't believe it's ended
with us sleeping in separate
rooms.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.267
Maybes we do need the girls
after all.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.933
Let's go to Blackpool.
We're going to Blackpool!

23:33.000 --> 23:35.333
I am absolutely shitting myself.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.400
Oh, my God!
Surprise!

23:37.467 --> 23:39.500
What the fuck
are the boys doing here?

23:39.567 --> 23:42.033
Did you pull?
Fuck me, this is a bit awkward.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.633
Called Laura.
Oh, my God, she's our friend.

23:44.700 --> 23:47.500
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:49.467 --> 23:49.667
.

23:52.167 --> 23:52.367
.

24:08.067 --> 24:11.833
I just don't think I can cope
today.
I think I'm dead.

24:11.900 --> 24:14.867
With Sam not being there,
last night, for me, was crazy.

24:14.933 --> 24:17.400
A little bit too much.
I was sick all over.

24:17.467 --> 24:20.633
At least I had a good night,
even though I don't remember it.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.600
You said you were gonna
go for a shit

24:22.667 --> 24:26.100
cos you didn't like what I had
to
say. I wonder how today is gonna
go.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.233
Fuckin' starving.

24:41.533 --> 24:44.333
Here we go.
What's happening? (laughs)

24:44.400 --> 24:48.233
Sorry for this morning, mate.
The
question is, how are you
feeling?

24:48.300 --> 24:50.100
I'm feeling fuckin' great.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.033
I'm glad Adam pulled last night,

24:52.100 --> 24:54.667
but I think I need to
tell him something about her.

24:54.733 --> 24:56.700
You know Laura, we all know her.

24:56.767 --> 24:59.567
She's good friends with Chloe,
isn't she? And Abbie.

24:59.633 --> 25:02.067
Shut up, man. Is she?

25:02.133 --> 25:05.700
Out of all the birds in
Newcastle,
I shagged one of the Abbie's
mates.

25:05.767 --> 25:06.800
Fuckin' typical.

25:06.867 --> 25:09.967
Where's fuckin' Nathan at, like?
I think he's next door.

25:10.033 --> 25:11.533
What the fuck...
Mate.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.967
We are all fuckin' mates
at the end of the day.

25:14.033 --> 25:17.767
I didn't want any of us falling
out.
It was a joke that's gone wrong.

25:17.833 --> 25:20.433
Things got a bit heated
with me and Nathan,

25:20.500 --> 25:23.100
and I pray this morning
we can just sort it out.

25:23.167 --> 25:25.667
I need him to understand
it was just a laugh.

25:25.733 --> 25:28.533
I'll get him in, right.
Give him a shout. Nathan!

25:28.600 --> 25:31.900
Are you coming in with the lads,
mate? Nath?

25:31.967 --> 25:35.100
I've woke up this morning
in the girls' room, alone,

25:35.167 --> 25:37.333
and everything is coming back to
me.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.800
And I do feel a bit embarrassed
about the way I went on last
night.

25:40.867 --> 25:43.567
So, I'll start off by saying,
we apologise.

25:43.633 --> 25:45.833
When I sit here now
and think about it,

25:45.900 --> 25:50.633
I'm really annoyed because
everything was going so
smoothly.

25:50.700 --> 25:53.833
It was going fuckin' mint.
We were having the best time.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.367
And then we had an argument.

25:55.433 --> 25:58.333
I love these lads.
I'm glad everything's sorted.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.100
Now we can focus on having fun.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.900
Please don't tell me
you shagged with your shoes on.

26:02.967 --> 26:04.833
No. Had me socks on, though.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.733
I told him this morning
it was one of Abbie's mates.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.567
By the way, Abbie, you won't put
out
but your fuckin' friends will.

26:11.633 --> 26:12.700
(laughter)

26:12.767 --> 26:16.733
And I'll go through them one by
one
until you give in.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.333
Obviously don't say that.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.667
As much as I love being a lads'
lad,

26:20.733 --> 26:24.333
I need a bit of girl time
before I forget myself.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.500
So, I've got a fuckin' wicked
idea.

26:26.567 --> 26:30.900
How do yous feel if we pack our
stuff
and we go see the girls, man?

26:30.967 --> 26:33.400
I'm up for that, like.
Lets go to Blackpool!

26:33.467 --> 26:36.100
We're going to Blackpool!
(both cheering)

26:36.167 --> 26:40.533
This is a belter of an idea.
Let's gate-crash the girls'
holiday.

26:47.667 --> 26:50.500
Sophie, I'm still fuckin'
mortal.
Same.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.467
It's rare that it's just
me and Chloe,

26:52.533 --> 26:55.833
and I'm enjoying spending
some one-on-one time with her.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.467
When I said let your hair down,

26:57.533 --> 27:00.900
I never thought in a million
years
you'd let it down that much.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.167
I'm scared to find out
what I was doing.

27:03.233 --> 27:05.400
I kept seeing you
having chats with Faith.

27:05.467 --> 27:08.900
I apologised cos the way I spoke
to
her was a little bit out of
order.

27:08.967 --> 27:12.067
She went, "I just don't like
the way you talk to me."

27:12.133 --> 27:14.433
Is she from Blackpool?
Dunno why I did that.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.733
The thing with me and Faith
is dragging on.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.000
I feel more awkward
than what I did before.

27:19.067 --> 27:22.600
But she just didn't accept
my apology. For fuck's sake.

27:22.667 --> 27:23.967
It's awkward, isn't it?

27:24.033 --> 27:27.000
I told Faith she needs
to stand up for herself more.

27:27.067 --> 27:30.467
But I think she's taken my
advice
too literally.

27:30.533 --> 27:33.533
I'm ready to have me breakfast
now.
Same.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.833
I've got you a couple of treats.

27:41.900 --> 27:43.933
We're off to Blackpool
for the night,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.100
so I'm leaving our rats
a cob to chew on.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.233
Chloe is gonna be so impressed.

27:51.867 --> 27:56.300
Right, yous, if this doesn't
scream
"Blackpool," I don't know....

27:56.367 --> 27:59.200
All you need now
is some strawberries and cream.

27:59.267 --> 28:02.033
Oh, they would take the edge
off the hangover.

28:02.100 --> 28:05.367
Blackpool is tacky. It's a bit
of me.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.667
So, if Anna calls, she can fuck
off.

28:07.733 --> 28:10.767
Cos me and the lads
are going to meet the girls.

28:10.833 --> 28:14.800
Family reunited in Blackpool
united!

28:14.867 --> 28:18.033
Hey!

28:18.100 --> 28:21.133
It's the bus, it's the bus,
it's the bus!

28:26.000 --> 28:28.533
As we're going to Blackpool,
it's only fitting

28:28.600 --> 28:31.933
if the first thing we do is go
to the Pleasure Beach. 100
percent.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.367
As much as I'd like to see the
girls, we wouldn't be true
Geordies

28:35.433 --> 28:38.867
if we didn't go straight to the
roller coasters first. Bring it
on!

28:38.933 --> 28:43.133
Can we not just go on the
teacups?
I'm not keen on roller coasters.

28:51.767 --> 28:54.233
All ready for the Pleasure
Beach?!
(all) Yeah!

28:54.300 --> 28:56.700
Sophie is smashing this girls'
trip.

28:56.767 --> 29:00.200
There is nothing us Geordies
love more than a fairground
ride.

29:00.267 --> 29:02.333
I am buzzing for the Pleasure
Beach.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.167
I feel like I'm on my holiday.
Woo!

29:04.233 --> 29:05.667
Oh, my God.

29:05.733 --> 29:07.533
Ah, shit!

29:07.600 --> 29:10.867
I hope my tits don't fall off.
You're fuckin' buying new tits.

29:10.933 --> 29:12.800
I am absolutely shitting myself.

29:12.867 --> 29:16.367
Oh, my God, this is horrible!
This is awful.

29:16.433 --> 29:19.900
(screaming)

29:22.933 --> 29:25.767
That was fucking awful.
That was so scary.

29:25.833 --> 29:30.400
That roller coaster was that
fast,
I think I lost a fuckin'
eyelash.

29:30.467 --> 29:31.800
Fuck! Look at the sea!

29:31.867 --> 29:33.567
(screams)

29:33.633 --> 29:36.767
I'm almost forgetting
the ups and downs that I'm
having

29:36.833 --> 29:38.667
trying to fit in with this lot.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.267
Oh, my God!

29:40.333 --> 29:41.533
(screaming)

29:41.600 --> 29:44.800
This ride is the best one
that I have had in a long time.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.467
(screaming)

29:46.533 --> 29:48.167
That was crazy, wasn't it?

29:52.867 --> 29:54.600
Yes, boys, we're here.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.500
(laughs)

29:56.567 --> 29:59.533
I can't wait to go on all the
rides,

29:59.600 --> 30:03.733
eat all the stick of rock, and
get pissed out my fuckin' head.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.367
Cos Blackpool is like
being on holiday, but in
England.

30:07.433 --> 30:10.200
I feel like we're abroad.
I feel like I'm in Miami.

30:10.267 --> 30:13.767
Adam, if you walk in front of
me,
I'm gonna kick the back of your
leg.

30:13.833 --> 30:16.067
You do walk in front.
He does as well!

30:16.133 --> 30:17.467
I'm sorry.

30:21.133 --> 30:23.767
Go on, get me a slush.

30:23.833 --> 30:26.333
Fuck off. I'm fuckin' sick.

30:26.400 --> 30:30.100
Being with the girls has made me
realise we should do this more
often.

30:30.167 --> 30:33.067
Chloe, I've really enjoyed
spending the day with you.

30:33.133 --> 30:35.567
It's just been the girls.
Do you miss Sam at all?

30:35.633 --> 30:39.233
I do miss him, but I'm enjoying
spending time with the girls.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.733
I think a little trip away
is always good.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.600
The way I went on last night
is just like the old Chloe,

30:44.667 --> 30:47.767
but with having a boyfriend now,
I've tamed it down.

30:47.833 --> 30:49.633
Cos that's a turn off.
Yeah.

30:49.700 --> 30:53.300
I don't understand why Chloe
needs to act different around
Sam.

30:53.367 --> 30:56.833
She's always been like that
and she should never change.

30:56.900 --> 31:01.400
We need to do more things like
this.
Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods.

31:03.533 --> 31:06.267
There's the girls, there they
are.
Where are they?

31:06.333 --> 31:08.700
I knew this lot
would be hanging around here.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.300
They can't resist a ride.

31:10.367 --> 31:13.233
(all) Surprise!
(girls screaming)

31:13.300 --> 31:14.600
Oh, my God, Sam's here!

31:16.467 --> 31:18.767
What the fuck
are the boys doing here?

31:18.833 --> 31:21.200
This was supposed to be
a girls' trip.

31:21.267 --> 31:22.967
We just got here now.

31:23.033 --> 31:25.900
Now that we've been reunited,
it's time to get on a ride.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.233
(screaming)

31:39.000 --> 31:41.533
Oh, yous, that was good.
I wanna go on again!

31:41.600 --> 31:44.967
I think we should go to the
beach
and get some fuckin' chips.

31:45.033 --> 31:48.400
Great idea, Nathan. After all of
that excitement, I am starving.

31:48.467 --> 31:50.833
What a lovely, beautiful day.

31:50.900 --> 31:54.367
Oh, my God, they're coming!
(screams)

31:54.433 --> 31:56.833
We're having a nice walk,
and all of a sudden,

31:56.900 --> 31:59.767
these pigeons are trying to nick
all of wuh chips.

31:59.833 --> 32:01.633
(laughter)

32:01.700 --> 32:03.300
(screams)

32:04.733 --> 32:07.400
I didn't miss yous much,
but now that you're here,

32:07.467 --> 32:09.233
how was the night out?
Eventful.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.867
What happened? Did you pull?

32:10.933 --> 32:14.267
He did!
I might have done, aye.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.900
Wanna know who it was?
Who?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.300
She's called Laura.
Do yous know her?

32:18.367 --> 32:20.933
Oh, my God, she's our friend.
Is she?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.933
Yeah!
(Chloe) Adam, that's awful.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.700
I don't fancy Adam,

32:24.767 --> 32:28.067
but him getting with one of my
mates
is just too close to home.

32:28.133 --> 32:30.033
You flirt with Abbie all the
time.

32:30.100 --> 32:31.967
Fuck me, this is a bit awkward.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.400
Who's coming to the B&B?
Howay then.

32:34.467 --> 32:37.333
I'm stuck on the wall.
I've got no pants on as well.

32:41.667 --> 32:44.233
Hey, honey! I'm here!

32:44.300 --> 32:45.700
Howay, get out.

32:45.767 --> 32:50.567
We've arrived at the B&B. I hope
I've
got a nice bed that's actually
clean.

32:50.633 --> 32:52.967
It's an all right little pad,
isn't it?

32:53.033 --> 32:56.733
Enough of the chit chat. We need
to
get ready to smash Blackpool up.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.333
Cos tonight, it's going off.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.000
Couldn't swing a cat in here.

33:05.433 --> 33:07.800
It sounds pathetic
cos it's been a day,

33:07.867 --> 33:10.267
but I was really excited
to see her.

33:10.333 --> 33:13.333
I know all of us lads
are buzzing to be here.

33:13.400 --> 33:17.067
But I just hope the girls aren't
annoyed that we crashed their
trip.

33:17.133 --> 33:19.633
Do you think the girls were
annoyed
or not?

33:19.700 --> 33:21.733
They did want girl time.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.533
Yeah.
That's why they're here.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.900
To be honest, I think we gave
them
a bit too much. They had a
night.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.700
It's like, before Sam got here,
she wasn't really missing him.

33:31.767 --> 33:33.367
She was having too much fun.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.667
The girls' trip
was fun while it lasted

33:35.733 --> 33:38.167
and I've enjoyed
hanging out with Chloe.

33:38.233 --> 33:41.000
But I can't imagine her
to be as fun as last night.

33:41.067 --> 33:43.067
Sam is gonna be all over her.

33:43.133 --> 33:45.800
If we ever go on
another girls' trip,

33:45.867 --> 33:48.533
I am gonna make sure
that them lads don't find us.

33:48.600 --> 33:52.433
Cos howay, man, I'm just gonna
go
somewhere else on a remote
island

33:52.500 --> 33:55.533
and make sure they don't find
out
where the fuck we go.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.333
Girls!
# Come on, come on

34:03.400 --> 34:06.133
# Come on! #

34:06.200 --> 34:09.833
We've got one night in Blackpool
and
I intend on making the most of
it.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.100
So come on, you lot,
let's get to the club.

34:12.167 --> 34:15.132
And four! Here we go, Blackpool.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.467
I can't do right from wrong.

34:23.533 --> 34:25.467
Oh, my God, no, it's all over my
leg.

34:25.533 --> 34:28.699
I've had an accident.
(laughter)

34:28.766 --> 34:31.667
(cheering)
Blackpool has ruined us.

34:31.733 --> 34:32.833
(retches)

34:32.900 --> 34:35.800
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

34:37.967 --> 34:38.167
.

34:40.667 --> 34:40.867
.

35:03.800 --> 35:08.733
We've all walked into the club,
and tonight, Blackpool is going
off.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.067
I am so glad
the lads are out with us.

35:12.133 --> 35:15.433
I don't think I could have
handled
another night just the girls.

35:42.267 --> 35:45.200
I've not spoken to Abbie
since I shagged her mate,

35:45.267 --> 35:47.133
so I'm gonna check that we're
sound.

36:01.067 --> 36:04.700
Me and Adam are good friends and
I don't want nothing to change
that.

36:04.767 --> 36:07.700
But it just felt a bit weird
him shagging my friend.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.900
Abbie seems fine
and we're really good pals,

36:16.967 --> 36:19.267
and I wouldn't want
anything to change that

36:19.333 --> 36:21.867
cos I love having a laugh
and a flirt with her.

36:36.967 --> 36:39.333
Me and Faith
still haven't properly made up.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.800
Now Nathan's here, I need to
tell him what happened last
night.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.233
Chloe can't handle it
when people challenge her,

36:53.300 --> 36:55.000
and Faith did that last night.

36:55.067 --> 36:57.233
They have more in common
than they think.

37:19.067 --> 37:22.900
Blackpool hasn't helped sort out
this thing between Chloe and
Faith.

37:22.967 --> 37:26.533
I feel like she's isolating
herself,
and she doesn't even know it.

37:30.333 --> 37:34.067
Me and Chloe may not have fully
made
up, but I did accept her
apology.

37:50.467 --> 37:53.533
I can't do right from wrong
with this lot. This is who I am.

37:53.600 --> 37:57.233
I'm getting really frustrated
with what the family expect from
us.

38:12.133 --> 38:15.333
Faith wants to talk to us, but
I'm having a really good night.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.167
I hope she doesn't start again!

38:37.633 --> 38:39.500
That's not quite how I remember
it.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.467
But I was really pissed
and don't remember anything.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.233
Chloe is finally listening
to what I'm saying.

38:54.300 --> 38:58.133
I just hope we can put this all
behind us now. I need another
drink.

39:19.267 --> 39:21.333
It's not easy walking into a
family

39:21.400 --> 39:24.033
that have known each other
as long as this lot.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.367
I was lucky that I fitted in
straight away.

39:32.367 --> 39:35.100
This time last night,
Chloe was being proper radge.

39:35.167 --> 39:38.367
But now in front of Sam,
it seems like she's holding
back.

39:45.433 --> 39:49.167
We've all smashed Blackpool
tonight.
Now let's get back to the B&B.

39:55.767 --> 39:57.333
Hey! Got the kebab.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.900
What the fuck has happened to
you?

39:59.967 --> 40:03.700
We get back to the B&B and
everyone
is stotting, especially Faith.

40:03.767 --> 40:06.233
I hope that the others
sort theirself out

40:06.300 --> 40:09.233
because I don't want to wake up
the rest of the guests.

40:10.767 --> 40:12.833
I don't know how much
I've had to drink,

40:12.900 --> 40:16.933
but my bladder is about to
explode
and I'm stuck on the stairs.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.533
Oh, no. Sorry, sorry.

40:21.733 --> 40:23.233
Nathan's weeing himself.

40:23.300 --> 40:26.300
Oh, Nathan, for God's sake,
if the owner sees this,

40:26.367 --> 40:27.933
we're gonna get kicked oot.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.600
I didn't do it on purpose.

40:29.667 --> 40:32.467
Oh, my God, no,
it's all over my leg. Get off.

40:32.533 --> 40:34.933
What's happened?
I've just pissed myself.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.367
I've had an accident.

40:37.433 --> 40:41.033
And to make matters worse,
the others are coming
downstairs.

40:41.100 --> 40:43.533
Urgh! What is it?!

40:43.600 --> 40:46.733
Wee.
Nathan, that's disgusting, man!

40:48.633 --> 40:50.167
Urgh! Ah!

40:50.233 --> 40:54.600
Nathan is a mess and we've ended
up
with piss on our feet.

40:54.667 --> 40:56.400
Me and Chloe are off to bed.

40:56.467 --> 41:00.400
Right. Come on, baby, I want you
to give me the ride of my life!

41:00.467 --> 41:05.000
I want you to ride me
like a cowgirl! Yee-haw!

41:05.067 --> 41:08.233
Faith?
Where the fuck's Faith gone?

41:08.300 --> 41:10.667
I don't fuckin' know.

41:10.733 --> 41:13.200
Adam, we need to find Faith.
(yells)

41:14.633 --> 41:17.567
I'm trying to get up the stairs,
Abbie's pulling us down.

41:17.633 --> 41:18.800
I cannae get up.

41:18.867 --> 41:20.833
Is she in here?

41:24.133 --> 41:28.100
I thought it was gonna be
something bad. It is bad.

41:28.167 --> 41:30.267
Faith is sat in the shower.

41:30.333 --> 41:33.800
Is she meditating?
Oh, no, she's just being sick.

41:33.867 --> 41:35.867
Are you OK?
Are you all right, darling?

41:35.933 --> 41:39.067
We'll get you to bed, yeah?
Do you want any chips?

41:39.133 --> 41:42.067
I think chips
is the last thing she wants. Oh.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.933
What the fuck is going on right
now?

41:45.000 --> 41:47.433
You all right?
(Faith) Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.233
(all speaking indistinctly,
farting sounds)

41:50.300 --> 41:53.700
Sorry.
She's funny here, I tell you
what.

41:54.933 --> 41:57.033
It's still going, it's still
going.

41:57.100 --> 41:59.467
It's still going!

41:59.533 --> 42:02.400
'This is the most hilarious
thing
I've ever seen.'

42:02.467 --> 42:04.700
After that, she's part of the
family.

42:04.767 --> 42:07.533
Oh, it smells.
Faith, I think I love you now,
mate.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.367
(laughs)
Oh, Faith, your farts stink!

42:11.333 --> 42:13.900
I know Blackpool
was supposed to be a girls'
trip,

42:13.967 --> 42:15.733
but I am so happy that Sam came,

42:15.800 --> 42:17.900
cos me and him are in
such a good place.

42:17.967 --> 42:20.367
I'm gonna give him
the ride of his life!

42:22.267 --> 42:26.067
(all cheering)

42:26.133 --> 42:29.267
I've dried off and I found the
others
in the girls' bedroom.

42:29.333 --> 42:32.600
And they've been taking care of
Faith
cos she's mortal,

42:32.667 --> 42:35.000
and this is why I love this
family.

42:35.067 --> 42:38.267
Can we stay together?
Let's stay together.

42:38.333 --> 42:42.000
I know we're just friends,
but when I've had a bit to
drink,

42:42.067 --> 42:44.100
I like a comfort blanket to
cuddle.

42:44.167 --> 42:45.967
Oh, you fuckin' stink.

42:46.033 --> 42:47.767
(laughter)

42:47.833 --> 42:49.867
And that blanket's name is Adam.

42:49.933 --> 42:51.933
Faith, are you all right?
(coughs)

42:52.000 --> 42:54.767
Oh, shit. That's my fucking
case.
(coughs)

42:54.833 --> 42:57.600
Faith's been sick on herself in
bed.
She's wrecked.

42:57.667 --> 42:59.833
But what can I get her to puke
in?
A drawer.

42:59.900 --> 43:01.400
(retches)

43:01.467 --> 43:04.667
I didn't even check there was
a Bible in there. (retches)

43:04.733 --> 43:07.600
I've had a great night
and everyone seems to be
talking.

43:07.667 --> 43:10.367
I've even enjoyed
the boys being here.

43:10.433 --> 43:12.800
But Blackpool has ruined us.

43:16.367 --> 43:17.867
The holiday isn't over yet.

43:17.933 --> 43:20.500
Ballroom dancing!

43:20.567 --> 43:23.467
My dress makes us look like
a fuckin' bumble bee.

43:23.533 --> 43:26.800
I love girls' night
because we get the old Chloe.

43:26.867 --> 43:29.400
I'm recycling!
Woo!

43:29.467 --> 43:32.167
I'm just plain.
What the fuck was that about?

43:35.467 --> 43:36.933
Is Sophie joking?
Sam!

43:37.000 --> 43:41.300
Sam and Chloe are going home and
we
don't know if they'll ever come
back.

43:44.533 --> 43:46.400
Tonight has been too much for
me.

43:46.467 --> 43:48.200
Yous are all saying I'm lying.

44:15.867 --> 44:16.067
.
