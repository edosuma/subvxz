Previously on Deadbeat...

00:10.987 --> 00:12.223
Ghosts stick around

00:12.223 --> 00:14.090
when they have unfinished business.

00:14.090 --> 00:15.025
I never got to have sex.

00:15.025 --> 00:16.260
I died a virgin.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.394
So, what were you, like a dentist?

00:17.394 --> 00:19.396
I was an avant-gardist.

00:19.396 --> 00:20.431
- You see me?
- Is that your first

00:20.431 --> 00:21.298
or your last name?

00:21.298 --> 00:22.466
- What?
- What?

00:22.466 --> 00:24.468
Finishing unfinished business

00:24.468 --> 00:26.771
is my business.

00:26.771 --> 00:27.471
(gasping)

00:27.471 --> 00:29.373
(screaming)

00:29.373 --> 00:32.209
(screaming)

00:33.377 --> 00:34.811
My guest today is

00:34.811 --> 00:37.113
celebrated paranormal communicator

00:37.113 --> 00:38.182
Camomile White.

00:38.182 --> 00:39.417
(speaking gibberish)

00:39.417 --> 00:41.252
Camomile White is a fraud.

00:41.252 --> 00:43.253
(screaming)

00:43.253 --> 00:44.421
Sue?

00:44.421 --> 00:45.555
And when I get paid,

00:45.555 --> 00:46.990
I'm gonna come back for you.

00:46.990 --> 00:48.859
I'm gonna rescue you from Camomile.

00:48.859 --> 00:51.061
Ms. White, please, I believe in Kevin.

00:51.061 --> 00:52.829
(eerie noises)

00:52.829 --> 00:55.066

00:55.066 --> 00:57.935
*

00:57.935 --> 00:59.436
Oh my God, Sue, you're dead.

00:59.436 --> 01:01.371
I can't move into my light

01:01.371 --> 01:03.441
until my body is buried at sea.

01:03.441 --> 01:07.441
*

01:10.246 --> 01:11.414
It didn't work.

01:11.414 --> 01:13.117
Maybe your unfinished business

01:13.117 --> 01:14.284
is something else.

01:14.284 --> 01:15.352
We'll figure it out.

01:15.352 --> 01:16.454
I'll help you, every day.

01:16.454 --> 01:17.487
No matter how long it takes.

01:17.487 --> 01:19.022
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19.022 --> 01:23.460
*

01:24.328 --> 01:26.963
*

01:26.963 --> 01:29.900
Well, shall we get going or... ?

01:29.900 --> 01:31.234
Yeah, yeah.

01:31.234 --> 01:32.203
I feel like we've been standing here

01:32.203 --> 01:33.270
for, like, a year.

01:33.270 --> 01:34.905
(chuckling)

01:34.905 --> 01:38.905
*

01:42.246 --> 01:44.981
(wind blowing)

01:44.981 --> 01:47.852
No!

01:47.852 --> 01:49.286
Psych, I'm totally kidding!

01:49.286 --> 01:50.420
Yo, no, no, no, no.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.489
Put that away, put that away.

01:51.489 --> 01:52.956
What? No, look, it's her finger.

01:52.956 --> 01:54.859
- Roofie, it's cute.
- I see what it is, man.

01:54.859 --> 01:56.394
Dude, so what the hell is your end game?

01:56.394 --> 01:58.027
Uh... what do you mean?

01:58.027 --> 01:59.462
You keepin' her on as a ghost on purpose?

01:59.462 --> 02:00.798
Yeah.

02:00.798 --> 02:01.932
Then what?

02:01.932 --> 02:02.966
Well, I haven't really thought

02:02.966 --> 02:03.933
that far ahead, okay, Roofie?

02:03.933 --> 02:05.335
But all I know is,

02:05.335 --> 02:06.569
I really like this girl, okay?

02:06.569 --> 02:07.871
I like her a lot and for

02:07.871 --> 02:09.006
the first time in my life,

02:09.006 --> 02:10.106
it feels like maybe somehow

02:10.106 --> 02:11.574
a girl likes me back.

02:11.574 --> 02:14.377
That's a big deal to me, okay?

02:14.377 --> 02:15.913
Also, I asked her to live with me,

02:15.913 --> 02:16.881
so I need you to hold on to the finger.

02:16.881 --> 02:18.014
- Hell no.
- Yes.

02:18.014 --> 02:19.250
- Hell no.
- Just touch it.

02:19.250 --> 02:20.450
This is what I'm talking about.

02:20.450 --> 02:22.152
You can't build a relationship on lies.

02:22.152 --> 02:23.287
- Why not?
- Because,

02:23.287 --> 02:24.454
you're terrible at lying.

02:24.454 --> 02:25.955
- No I'm not.
- Now Sue believes

02:25.955 --> 02:28.025
she has some other unfinished business

02:28.025 --> 02:29.360
that you have to go on a wild goose chase

02:29.360 --> 02:30.260
to solve.

02:30.260 --> 02:31.194
Great job.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.763
A little credit, please.

02:32.763 --> 02:34.164
I have it under control.

02:34.164 --> 02:35.800
(laughs incredulously)

02:35.800 --> 02:37.134
Okay, yeah, we'll see.

02:37.134 --> 02:38.536
We'll see. Hey, listen.

02:38.536 --> 02:39.569
This... I don't.

02:39.569 --> 02:41.337
Just touch it.

02:43.039 --> 02:44.942

Sue's Potential Unfinished Business

03:25.816 --> 03:27.884
Finish this list.

03:29.385 --> 03:31.187
(groans)

03:31.187 --> 03:32.990
Well, I guess that wasn't it either.

03:32.990 --> 03:34.557
- Shoot.
- It's useless.

03:34.557 --> 03:35.925
I'm never gonna figure it out.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.427
No, no, no, we will, we will.

03:37.427 --> 03:39.163
Let's do something to
take your mind off it.

03:39.163 --> 03:40.296
There's a Felonies and Misdemeanors

03:40.296 --> 03:41.365
marathon on today.

03:41.365 --> 03:43.033
Let's watch that together.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.134
The noise complaint was called in

03:44.134 --> 03:45.436
at 10 p.m. but the party

03:45.436 --> 03:48.104
was clearly over at 9.

03:48.104 --> 03:49.105
How's that possible?

03:49.105 --> 03:50.341
It's not possible.

03:50.341 --> 03:52.308
It's not even a crime.

03:52.308 --> 03:55.478
Unless... Daylight savings.

03:55.478 --> 03:57.114
Daylight savings, I knew it.

03:57.114 --> 03:58.414
I was there with them.

03:58.414 --> 04:00.183
That's a goddamn misdemeanor.

04:00.183 --> 04:01.852
Ah, genius.

04:01.852 --> 04:03.052
I heard they had to replace the two leads

04:03.052 --> 04:04.420
'cause they wanted bigger trailers.

04:04.420 --> 04:07.390
My ex used to love this show.

04:07.390 --> 04:09.526
- Your ex?
- Not ex, just this guy

04:09.526 --> 04:11.127
who I saw a couple of times.

04:11.127 --> 04:12.228
I thought it was gonna turn into

04:12.228 --> 04:13.463
something serious but then

04:13.463 --> 04:15.098
outta nowhere, he just ghosted me.

04:15.098 --> 04:16.399
Ew, gross. Sue!

04:16.399 --> 04:17.834
What? No.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.103
He ghosted me,

04:19.103 --> 04:20.336
like he stopped responding

04:20.336 --> 04:21.771
to my calls and texts,

04:21.771 --> 04:22.939
vanished into thin air.

04:22.939 --> 04:24.408
Oh, I thought...

04:24.408 --> 04:25.543
I thought you meant when a guy stands

04:25.543 --> 04:26.776
over you and just completely

04:26.776 --> 04:28.112
covers your face with his...

04:28.112 --> 04:29.480
Nothing. Never mind.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.514
Wait, maybe that's my unfinished business.

04:31.514 --> 04:33.117
Ew, gross. Sue!

04:33.117 --> 04:35.151
What? No. Glen, the ex.

04:35.151 --> 04:36.120
We were supposed to have

04:36.120 --> 04:37.221
a date by the river

04:37.221 --> 04:38.923
but then he never showed.

04:38.923 --> 04:40.324
He never even called.

04:40.324 --> 04:41.457
It really effed me up.

04:41.457 --> 04:42.893
That's total B.S.

04:42.893 --> 04:43.961
We gotta go find that guy.

04:43.961 --> 04:45.161
Yeah, we should find him.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.196
We should absolutely and you can

04:46.196 --> 04:47.398
finally confront him.

04:47.398 --> 04:48.865
And figure out what I did wrong.

04:48.865 --> 04:51.067
Yeah! No. What?

04:51.067 --> 04:54.572
Does the color red

04:54.572 --> 04:56.372
mean anything to you?

04:56.372 --> 04:57.841
My husband, Thomas,

04:57.841 --> 04:59.310
he always wore a red hat.

04:59.310 --> 05:03.079
And you two loved melon picking.

05:03.079 --> 05:04.415
Eh... no.

05:04.415 --> 05:05.516
Hold on a second, Linda,

05:05.516 --> 05:06.449
close your eyes with me.

05:06.449 --> 05:07.850
Breathe again.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.319
(loud inhalations)

05:09.319 --> 05:13.319
*

05:14.158 --> 05:15.225
A bowling team.

05:15.225 --> 05:16.492
(gasps)

05:16.492 --> 05:18.329
I just can't believe it.

05:18.329 --> 05:20.363
Linda.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.497
Linda.

05:21.497 --> 05:23.233
It's okay, Linda.

05:23.233 --> 05:26.235
Thomas died driving home

05:26.235 --> 05:28.305
from the bowling alley.

05:28.305 --> 05:29.939
He was so angry.

05:29.939 --> 05:31.175
Because you had lost...

05:31.175 --> 05:32.276
I was cheating on him.

05:32.276 --> 05:33.543
... monogamy.

05:33.543 --> 05:35.346
Thomas has completely forgiven you.

05:35.346 --> 05:36.947
He has moved on

05:36.947 --> 05:39.016
and he is at peace now.

05:39.016 --> 05:40.451
He is... (glass shattering)

05:40.451 --> 05:41.951
What... my God.

05:41.951 --> 05:43.853
- Was that him?
- No, that wasn't him.

05:43.853 --> 05:45.288
That was the ghost

05:45.288 --> 05:47.124
of a former tenant or something.

05:47.124 --> 05:48.192
A melon magnate

05:48.192 --> 05:49.459
who hates plates.

05:49.459 --> 05:50.793
Not important.

05:50.793 --> 05:52.295
All this is not important to us.

05:52.295 --> 05:54.064
What is important

05:54.064 --> 05:57.100
is your husband, Thomas.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.536
He is now completely at peace.

06:00.536 --> 06:02.505
(glass shattering)

06:02.505 --> 06:04.274
Thomas?

06:04.274 --> 06:06.509
This definitely does not seem

06:06.509 --> 06:07.478
like he is at peace.

06:07.478 --> 06:10.180
Please, Ms. White,

06:10.180 --> 06:12.850
do I need to stop banging his brother?

06:12.850 --> 06:13.550
No!

06:13.550 --> 06:14.851
This is... Cut!

06:14.851 --> 06:16.819
This is not going to work.

06:16.819 --> 06:17.821
What...

06:17.821 --> 06:21.057
Everybody take five.

06:21.057 --> 06:23.093
You okay, Ms. White?

06:23.093 --> 06:24.528
Need a little something? Some water?

06:24.528 --> 06:26.930
One of those legally prescribed

06:26.930 --> 06:27.997
"calm me down" pills?

06:27.997 --> 06:29.932
No, I don't need pills.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.201
I need...

06:31.201 --> 06:33.771
*

06:33.771 --> 06:35.105
This is his place.

06:35.105 --> 06:36.139
Can't wait to give this dickhead

06:36.139 --> 06:38.042
a piece of your mind.

06:38.042 --> 06:39.308
Oh!

06:39.308 --> 06:41.211
Hey, talk about perfect timing, huh?

06:41.211 --> 06:42.980
No, no, not at all.

06:42.980 --> 06:44.915
Actually, do you mind
shutting the door again?

06:44.915 --> 06:46.082
I want to use the loud knocking

06:46.082 --> 06:47.418
to pump myself up, you know?

06:47.418 --> 06:48.584
Excuse me.

06:48.584 --> 06:50.954
Oh, all right, bye, Zoila.

06:50.954 --> 06:52.822
Bye, Mr. Glen.

06:52.822 --> 06:54.024
I'll see you real soon, okay?

06:54.024 --> 06:56.326
Yeah, shit, I had a whole thing.

06:56.326 --> 06:57.795
Now I'm, like, totally thrown off.

06:57.795 --> 06:59.362
Oh, okay, no, I'm sorry.

06:59.362 --> 07:00.396
Please, just take your time.

07:00.396 --> 07:01.264
Yeah, okay, thank you.

07:01.264 --> 07:03.500
So... (clears throat)

07:03.500 --> 07:04.867
... this dickhead a piece of your mind.

07:04.867 --> 07:06.536
Run up the stairs. Doo-doo-doo!

07:06.536 --> 07:07.370
(imitating door creaking)

07:07.370 --> 07:08.805
"Can I help you?"

07:08.805 --> 07:09.839
"No, I don't think you can help me

07:09.839 --> 07:10.807
'cause you don't help anyone."

07:10.807 --> 07:11.841
(mumbling)

07:11.841 --> 07:13.043
Ah yes, right, right!

07:13.043 --> 07:14.812
Because you enjoy hurting others

07:14.812 --> 07:16.112
for your own sick pleasure.

07:16.112 --> 07:17.781
- Don't you?
- Oh, golly, no.

07:17.781 --> 07:18.781
I'm a doctor.

07:18.781 --> 07:20.384
A doctor!

07:20.384 --> 07:22.752
So... you...

07:22.752 --> 07:25.254
exploiter people's illnesses and injuries

07:25.254 --> 07:27.423
for your own sick profit, don't you?

07:27.423 --> 07:28.524
Oh, well, actually,

07:28.524 --> 07:30.360
I'm a volunteer.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.028
Yeah, I come from a lot of money,

07:32.028 --> 07:34.064
so I usually just donate my salary

07:34.064 --> 07:35.199
back to the hospital.

07:35.199 --> 07:36.165
Oh.

07:36.165 --> 07:37.233
Ask him about me.

07:37.233 --> 07:38.201
Oh, right, yeah.

07:38.201 --> 07:40.204
Yeah, eh, anyway.

07:40.204 --> 07:41.271
I'm a medium and I'm here

07:41.271 --> 07:43.439
with the ghost of Sue...

07:43.439 --> 07:45.375
Tabernacle.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.845
Tabernacle?

07:47.845 --> 07:49.480
Sue Tabernacle.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.814
Sue Tabernacle?

07:50.814 --> 07:53.283
Yeah.

07:53.283 --> 07:54.384
(crying)

07:54.384 --> 07:55.886
Oh, don't cry. What are...

07:55.886 --> 07:57.019
(sobbing)

07:57.019 --> 07:58.855
No!

07:58.855 --> 07:59.923
Uh...

07:59.923 --> 08:00.923
I can't believe it.

08:00.923 --> 08:02.425
After all this time,

08:02.425 --> 08:03.961
I finally find her and she's dead.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.062
What are you, what are you,

08:05.062 --> 08:06.129
what are you talking about?

08:06.129 --> 08:07.430
Sue and I used to date.

08:07.430 --> 08:08.531
Yes, I know, I know all this already.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.067
I'm a med...

08:10.067 --> 08:11.268
You were supposed to meet her down by

08:11.268 --> 08:12.336
the river and you stood her up.

08:12.336 --> 08:14.504
No, no, I didn't!

08:14.504 --> 08:16.005
I had it all planned out.

08:16.005 --> 08:17.173
Wine and cheese.

08:17.173 --> 08:18.274
I even brought my laptop

08:18.274 --> 08:19.408
with a special playlist

08:19.408 --> 08:21.278
I'd made just for that day.

08:21.278 --> 08:22.312
But on the way there,

08:22.312 --> 08:23.413
something happened.

08:23.413 --> 08:27.413
*

08:29.052 --> 08:31.822
I knew if that taxi hit those bottles,

08:31.822 --> 08:33.123
they'd be worthless

08:33.123 --> 08:34.258
and that man wouldn't be able to drink

08:34.258 --> 08:35.458
his sorrows away.

08:35.458 --> 08:38.061
So I did what any man would do.

08:38.061 --> 08:39.363
*

08:39.363 --> 08:41.965
(tires squealing)

08:41.965 --> 08:44.534
*

08:45.501 --> 08:46.436
Sorry!

08:46.436 --> 08:47.270
My leg was broken

08:47.270 --> 08:48.371
in two places.

08:48.371 --> 08:49.807
Yeah, well, Sue's heart

08:49.807 --> 08:51.475
was broken in three places.

08:51.475 --> 08:52.509
You could have at least called.

08:52.509 --> 08:53.576
No, I couldn't!

08:53.576 --> 08:54.912
Because my phone was broken

08:54.912 --> 08:56.013
in four places.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.514
I lost all my contacts.

08:57.514 --> 09:00.384
Especially Sue's.

09:00.384 --> 09:01.518
Yeah, well, Sue doesn't buy that

09:01.518 --> 09:02.451
your phone wasn't backed up

09:02.451 --> 09:03.287
to your computer.

09:03.287 --> 09:04.520
Yes, it was.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.788
My laptop.

09:05.788 --> 09:07.090
But I had to break it in half

09:07.090 --> 09:08.792
to use it as a splint.

09:08.792 --> 09:11.427
(screams in pain)

09:11.427 --> 09:14.130
(bones cracking)

09:14.130 --> 09:16.133
I had no idea where Sue lived.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.400
I knew if I didn't reach her

09:17.400 --> 09:18.534
before she left that park,

09:18.534 --> 09:21.004
I'd lose her forever.

09:21.004 --> 09:22.405
But I was too late.

09:22.405 --> 09:23.974
No!

09:23.974 --> 09:26.876
(screaming in pain)

09:29.779 --> 09:30.980
There you go, the relationship

09:30.980 --> 09:32.448
literally ended by accident.

09:32.448 --> 09:34.384
There's no reason for us
to even be here anymore.

09:34.384 --> 09:35.952
Wait, maybe there's a different reason

09:35.952 --> 09:37.153
why we're here.

09:37.153 --> 09:39.056
Maybe Glen and I need to reconnect.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.323
- Sue...
- Wait!

09:40.323 --> 09:42.192
Maybe there is a reason you're here.

09:42.192 --> 09:43.460
Maybe this is fate

09:43.460 --> 09:45.562
giving us a second chance.

09:45.562 --> 09:48.097
Maybe Sue and I just...

09:48.097 --> 09:49.232
need to reconnect.

09:49.232 --> 09:50.366
(gasps)

09:50.366 --> 09:54.366
*

10:00.107 --> 10:02.845
Of course I remember that gelato place.

10:02.845 --> 10:05.514
How funny was the signage?

10:05.514 --> 10:07.182
Such poor choice of words.

10:07.182 --> 10:08.517
Oh yeah, Sue remembers

10:08.517 --> 10:10.485
and she also thought the sign was funny.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.953
But, uh, again,

10:11.953 --> 10:13.855
you had to be there, so...

10:13.855 --> 10:15.123
Oh, oh my God.

10:15.123 --> 10:16.490
Do you remember when we snuck

10:16.490 --> 10:18.192
onto that baseball field that night?

10:18.192 --> 10:20.062
Yes!

10:20.062 --> 10:21.163
Uh, Sue remembers

10:21.163 --> 10:22.230
and she's blushing. Next.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.197
Do you remember when we got

10:23.197 --> 10:24.466
to second base?

10:24.466 --> 10:26.335
I hope that you are talking about

10:26.335 --> 10:28.269
the actual second base.

10:28.269 --> 10:29.871
- Yeah, I am.
- Oh, you are?

10:29.871 --> 10:31.105
Oh, good.

10:31.105 --> 10:32.407
So, what happened on second base?

10:32.407 --> 10:33.808
Oh, we totally had sex.

10:33.808 --> 10:35.977
Okay, I really have to use

10:35.977 --> 10:36.879
the bathroom now.

10:36.879 --> 10:38.080
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.380
There's two on this level.

10:39.380 --> 10:43.380
*

10:46.254 --> 10:47.889
(telephone ringing)

10:47.889 --> 10:49.224
_

10:49.224 --> 10:50.359
*

10:50.359 --> 10:51.759
Yo, what up?

10:51.759 --> 10:52.894
Roofie, I need your advice, man,

10:52.894 --> 10:54.162
it's all going to shit.

10:54.162 --> 10:55.463
Yo, Pac, I can barely hear you, man.

10:55.463 --> 10:56.999
Are you in a tsunami?

10:56.999 --> 10:58.399
You have to speak up, I can't hear you,

10:58.399 --> 10:59.533
I turned the shower on
so no one can hear me

10:59.533 --> 11:00.969
having a phone conversation.

11:00.969 --> 11:02.336
Okay, well, now I can't hear you.

11:02.336 --> 11:03.404
Roofie, I can barely hear you over

11:03.404 --> 11:04.806
the noise of the shower.

11:04.806 --> 11:06.541
No, no... Pac, turn the shower off

11:06.541 --> 11:08.009
because I can't hear you.

11:08.009 --> 11:09.344
Oh, I think we got a bad connection.

11:09.344 --> 11:10.879
No, no, we don't have a bad connection,

11:10.879 --> 11:11.879
you got the shower...

11:11.879 --> 11:13.148
If you turn the shower off,

11:13.148 --> 11:14.850
you won't have a bad connection.

11:14.850 --> 11:16.217
Bad connection.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.153
Ah!

11:18.153 --> 11:19.821
Hello?

11:19.821 --> 11:21.255
Hello?

11:21.255 --> 11:25.059
*

11:25.059 --> 11:26.427
I'm back.

11:26.427 --> 11:27.763
I'm so sorry about that.

11:27.763 --> 11:29.463
That was a little rude.

11:29.463 --> 11:30.765
Where were we?

11:30.765 --> 11:32.033
Kevin, can you tell Glen

11:32.033 --> 11:33.769
I wish I had reached out sooner?

11:33.769 --> 11:34.970
Sure, I wish that

11:34.970 --> 11:36.304
I had reached out sooner.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.905
- You do?
- What? No.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.206
Tell him it came from me.

11:39.206 --> 11:40.808
- It came from me.
- What came from you?

11:40.808 --> 11:42.076
No, tell him that part

11:42.076 --> 11:43.144
came from me.

11:43.144 --> 11:44.211
Part of it came from me.

11:44.211 --> 11:46.014
Which part came from you?

11:46.014 --> 11:47.548
No, tell him Sue.

11:47.548 --> 11:49.051
- Sue.
- I'm sorry,

11:49.051 --> 11:50.751
I'm a little bit lost here.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.254
Glen apologizes for getting lost

11:52.254 --> 11:53.355
in the conversation.

11:53.355 --> 11:54.288
Why are you acting weird?

11:54.288 --> 11:56.424
Am I?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.025
I'm sorry, I don't...

11:58.025 --> 12:00.227
You know what, I have a terrible headache

12:00.227 --> 12:01.263
that's kinda brewing up.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.397
Oh yeah, of course.

12:02.397 --> 12:03.498
Can I have a lie-down, or... ?

12:03.498 --> 12:04.932
Yes, I totally get it, man.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.134
This has been a big day

12:06.134 --> 12:07.269
for all of us.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.503
- Yeah.
- But I really...

12:08.503 --> 12:10.205
I would love to talk to Sue again.

12:10.205 --> 12:11.306
- I bet.
- Maybe we can

12:11.306 --> 12:13.075
finish that date we never had.

12:13.075 --> 12:15.443
Maybe tomorrow.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.245
- Please?
- Yeah.

12:17.245 --> 12:18.980
Um, Sue would like to know

12:18.980 --> 12:20.816
if you are free tomorrow.

12:20.816 --> 12:22.850
Oh, uh, that's tricky.

12:22.850 --> 12:25.052
I'm actually getting married tomorrow.

12:25.052 --> 12:26.288
- Married! Ha!
- Married?

12:26.288 --> 12:27.822
Oh, no, it's not what you think.

12:27.822 --> 12:29.057
It's just so Zoila,

12:29.057 --> 12:30.158
my Guatemalan cleaning lady,

12:30.158 --> 12:31.493
can get her green card.

12:31.493 --> 12:32.894
So it'll be easier for her to send money

12:32.894 --> 12:34.096
back home to her sister

12:34.096 --> 12:35.297
who's in desperate need

12:35.297 --> 12:36.831
of gender reassignment surgery.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.299
Oh!

12:38.299 --> 12:39.768
But hey, that's at 2.

12:39.768 --> 12:40.836
How's 2:30?

12:40.836 --> 12:43.804
*

12:43.804 --> 12:45.006
"Oh, sure, Sue,"

12:45.006 --> 12:46.073
I'll totally help you reconnect

12:46.073 --> 12:47.241
with your dreamy ex-boyfriend.

12:47.241 --> 12:48.376
"That's a good idea."

12:48.376 --> 12:49.811
Idiot!

12:49.811 --> 12:51.746
Guy makes me look like Miss Piggy.

12:51.746 --> 12:53.081
Come on!

12:53.081 --> 12:55.149
Not now.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.250
Oh, come on, unbelievable.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.052
What's next, rain?

12:58.052 --> 12:59.855
(pigeon cooing)

13:02.923 --> 13:03.958
Well, at least one lucky thing

13:03.958 --> 13:06.094
happened today.

13:06.094 --> 13:07.796
Well, well, well,

13:07.796 --> 13:09.464
if it isn't my favorite

13:09.464 --> 13:12.868
sometime collaborator, Mr. Pacalioglu.

13:12.868 --> 13:13.869
- What?
- Oh.

13:13.869 --> 13:15.202
Let me help you here.

13:15.202 --> 13:18.139
Listen, I know we've had our differences

13:18.139 --> 13:19.408
in the past, you and I.

13:19.408 --> 13:20.775
Yeah, you stole my job,

13:20.775 --> 13:22.043
you humiliated me in front of

13:22.043 --> 13:23.345
the New York press, and you made me

13:23.345 --> 13:24.980
look like a dickhead in front of the mayor!

13:24.980 --> 13:25.913
Like I said, we've had

13:25.913 --> 13:27.149
our differences.

13:27.149 --> 13:28.884
But all that is in the past now, isn't it?

13:28.884 --> 13:30.118
- Is it?
- I've got my own

13:30.118 --> 13:31.919
reality TV show in the works

13:31.919 --> 13:33.889
and I'd like to offer you a job.

13:33.889 --> 13:34.956
- A job?
- Mm-hm.

13:34.956 --> 13:38.092
(laughing incredulously)

13:38.092 --> 13:39.394
Something humorous about that?

13:39.394 --> 13:41.462
What? No, no, I'm sorry,

13:41.462 --> 13:42.496
I was thinking about something funny

13:42.496 --> 13:43.532
from earlier.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.899
So you'll take the job?

13:44.899 --> 13:46.868
What in the world do you think

13:46.868 --> 13:48.269
you have to offer me that could make me

13:48.269 --> 13:51.005
want to work for you ever?

13:51.005 --> 13:53.442
I can think of a few things.

13:53.442 --> 13:55.811
*

13:55.811 --> 13:57.846
I'm sorry, Ms. White, but your...

13:57.846 --> 13:59.880
charms no longer hold sway over me.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.950
*

14:01.950 --> 14:03.485
Something in your pants

14:03.485 --> 14:05.019
suggests the contrary.

14:05.019 --> 14:07.022
Oh, that?

14:07.022 --> 14:08.856
I was thinking about something sexy

14:08.856 --> 14:10.491
from earlier.

14:10.491 --> 14:13.128
I gotta go, I gotta go.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.400
So, what, you just ran?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.001
I just ran.

14:21.001 --> 14:23.171
I did like a full bum out, boner jog

14:23.171 --> 14:24.873
but it was like "pew" down the street.

14:24.873 --> 14:26.307
Fast. Tuck and duck.

14:26.307 --> 14:27.542
Yeah, she was in my boner dust.

14:27.542 --> 14:29.009
I'm proud of you, man.

14:29.009 --> 14:30.312
You practiced some restraint, that's dope.

14:30.312 --> 14:31.346
You know, and maybe this means

14:31.346 --> 14:32.913
I'm finally over Camomile White

14:32.913 --> 14:34.149
or at the very least,

14:34.149 --> 14:35.549
I've gotten really good at lying to myself

14:35.549 --> 14:36.350
about being over her.

14:36.350 --> 14:37.818
So, either way.

14:37.818 --> 14:38.919
Yo, speaking of lies, how's it going

14:38.919 --> 14:40.020
with your little ghost boo?

14:40.020 --> 14:41.155
Uh...

14:41.155 --> 14:43.325
The ghost boo, lies situation

14:43.325 --> 14:45.427
is not going very well, I fear.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.894
I am now being asked to help her

14:46.894 --> 14:50.131
get closure with her ex-boyfriend.

14:50.131 --> 14:51.732
So, man up.

14:51.732 --> 14:52.767
Help her get closure, Pac.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.235
I know, it's just that

14:54.235 --> 14:56.471
there's not any real closure to be had.

14:56.471 --> 14:57.905
And now the more that these two talk

14:57.905 --> 14:58.907
to each other, the deeper she falls

14:58.907 --> 15:00.341
under his nice guy spell.

15:00.341 --> 15:02.009
Time out, you listening
to what you're saying?

15:02.009 --> 15:04.044
You're saying the more they talk, right?

15:04.044 --> 15:05.212
Like, you the one running the show.

15:05.212 --> 15:06.214
You the only one that can hear.

15:06.214 --> 15:07.349
Unless this guy develop

15:07.349 --> 15:08.450
a talent for hearing ghosts,

15:08.450 --> 15:09.384
then as far as I see it

15:09.384 --> 15:10.451
you good, baby.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.287
'Cause he's not, he's not gonna.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.455
Closure, you know?

15:13.455 --> 15:14.889
Okay, I got it.

15:14.889 --> 15:18.025
*

15:18.025 --> 15:19.193
No, no, I got it.

15:19.193 --> 15:22.230
*

15:22.230 --> 15:23.831
That felt exotic.

15:23.831 --> 15:25.866
What? Glen.

15:25.866 --> 15:29.070
You died? What the hell, man?

15:31.754 --> 15:32.788
Craziest thing.

15:32.788 --> 15:34.256
I go into the bathroom

15:34.256 --> 15:35.625
to take a bowel movement,

15:35.625 --> 15:36.926
I slip on a huge puddle of water,

15:36.926 --> 15:38.628
crack my head wide open.

15:38.628 --> 15:39.663
Yeah, I guess I forgot to tuck

15:39.663 --> 15:41.264
the liner into the tub

15:41.264 --> 15:42.865
before my last shower.

15:42.865 --> 15:44.500
Yeah, yeah.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.536
But hey, on the bright side,

15:46.536 --> 15:49.338
now I can talk to Sue without a translator.

15:49.338 --> 15:50.407
Looks like we can make that date

15:50.407 --> 15:51.441
work without you.

15:51.441 --> 15:53.710
Oh good, everybody wins.

15:53.710 --> 15:55.412
Everyone except Zoila.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.613
I'm sorry, who?

15:56.613 --> 15:57.880
My Guatemalan cleaning lady.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.349
Oh, yeah.

15:59.349 --> 16:00.649
Not being able to

16:00.649 --> 16:02.284
give her that green card will be

16:02.284 --> 16:04.888
the biggest regret of my life.

16:04.888 --> 16:06.655
The one thing I left unfinished.

16:06.655 --> 16:08.457
*

16:08.457 --> 16:10.493
But what are you gonna do?

16:10.493 --> 16:12.495
I don't know.

16:12.495 --> 16:13.897
All right, well, I'm off

16:13.897 --> 16:15.565
to my date.

16:16.799 --> 16:20.799
*

16:21.738 --> 16:23.405
So you want me to tail this guy?

16:23.405 --> 16:25.508
Well, I can't bloody do it, can I?

16:25.508 --> 16:26.676
He knows me.

16:26.676 --> 16:28.977
I'm a famous television actor.

16:28.977 --> 16:29.979
Yes.

16:29.979 --> 16:31.681
A famous, brilliant

16:31.681 --> 16:32.716
television actor

16:32.716 --> 16:34.918
who plays a detective.

16:34.918 --> 16:38.620
A strong, smart detective,

16:38.620 --> 16:41.323
who always gets his man.

16:41.323 --> 16:43.659
Or woman. Sorry.

16:43.659 --> 16:44.927
I mean, we just,

16:44.927 --> 16:46.962
we are very careful on the show

16:46.962 --> 16:49.365
to portray women as criminals too.

16:49.365 --> 16:52.501
Be that detective, Matthew.

16:52.501 --> 16:54.236
For me.

16:55.739 --> 16:57.373
So, I know you had your heart

16:57.373 --> 16:58.741
set on marrying Glen,

16:58.741 --> 17:01.344
but for the before-mentioned reasons,

17:01.344 --> 17:02.445
it ain't gonna happen.

17:02.445 --> 17:03.846
Lo siento.

17:03.846 --> 17:05.582
No Inglés.

17:05.582 --> 17:06.982
Let's see, how do I put this

17:06.982 --> 17:08.684
delicately?

17:08.684 --> 17:09.853
Uh, Mr. Glen...

17:09.853 --> 17:11.954
Sí, sí, Mr. Glen.

17:11.954 --> 17:13.355
(whistling)

17:13.355 --> 17:14.423
Whoop!

17:14.423 --> 17:16.425
(imitating crashing sounds)

17:16.425 --> 17:18.027
Oh no!

17:18.027 --> 17:20.695
No! Mr. Glen!

17:20.695 --> 17:21.931
I know, Mr. Glen,

17:21.931 --> 17:23.266
but... yeah, yeah, but, you know what,

17:23.266 --> 17:24.467
it's okay.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.602
It's okay, because you know why?

17:25.602 --> 17:28.238
'Cause I'm gonna marry you.

17:28.238 --> 17:29.939
I will marry you.

17:29.939 --> 17:31.775
*

17:31.775 --> 17:34.376
Zoila, look, look, I...

17:34.376 --> 17:35.944
Zoila.

17:35.944 --> 17:37.881
(spits)

17:37.881 --> 17:39.516
Will you do me the honor of letting me

17:39.516 --> 17:41.416
be the number one man in your life?

17:41.416 --> 17:42.551
¿Tú?

17:42.551 --> 17:43.752
Yeah, okay, number two man

17:43.752 --> 17:45.355
in your life, Glen was option A,

17:45.355 --> 17:47.624
I'm option B, obviously.

17:49.291 --> 17:50.425
Sí.

17:50.425 --> 17:52.662
All right, yeah, option C, fine.

17:52.662 --> 17:54.364
Whatever, do you want a green card or not?

17:54.364 --> 17:56.398
Oh, espera, espera.

18:02.471 --> 18:03.573
We need to provide proof

18:03.573 --> 18:05.441
of a meaningful relationship?

18:05.441 --> 18:07.743
That could take hours!

18:07.743 --> 18:11.743
*

18:15.818 --> 18:17.720
(camera clicking)

18:17.720 --> 18:21.720
*

18:40.742 --> 18:42.612
_

18:42.612 --> 18:43.947
You have the necessary paperwork

18:43.947 --> 18:45.414
and proof of relationship?

18:45.414 --> 18:47.383
Yes, of course.

18:47.383 --> 18:48.518
There you go.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.586
Should all be accounted for.

18:50.586 --> 18:54.586
*

18:57.993 --> 19:00.596
How did you two like Paris?

19:00.596 --> 19:02.832
Fine. Expensive.

19:02.832 --> 19:05.500
And how'd you two like the moon?

19:05.500 --> 19:09.500
*

19:12.976 --> 19:15.778
Good. It was warm.

19:15.778 --> 19:17.779
- The moon was warm?
- Yeah, really warm.

19:17.779 --> 19:19.481
Unseasonably warm.

19:19.481 --> 19:20.782
That's why I was so sweaty.

19:20.782 --> 19:22.251
Yeah, I took that picture

19:22.251 --> 19:23.519
at the National Air and Space Museum

19:23.519 --> 19:26.422
in D.C. two Labor Days ago.

19:26.422 --> 19:27.856
It was hot as hell, right?

19:27.856 --> 19:29.325
- Roofie, you made it.
- I know.

19:29.325 --> 19:30.593
I thought you might need a witness.

19:30.593 --> 19:34.593
*

19:37.366 --> 19:38.835
One last question.

19:38.835 --> 19:41.770
Since she clearly can't speak English,

19:41.770 --> 19:44.606
I take it you can speak Spanish?

19:44.606 --> 19:46.241
Sí.

19:46.241 --> 19:47.844
Sí.

19:47.844 --> 19:50.947
- See?
- Mm-hm.

19:50.947 --> 19:53.682
Good enough for me.

19:53.682 --> 19:54.917
_

19:54.917 --> 19:58.917
*

20:08.730 --> 20:10.900
(boat horn blowing)

20:11.934 --> 20:14.237
Hey! Hey. Hi, Sue!

20:14.237 --> 20:15.404
I am so sorry I'm late.

20:15.404 --> 20:16.772
I got a little hung up

20:16.772 --> 20:20.343
but, uh, did Glen ever show up or... ?

20:20.343 --> 20:21.411
Actually, he did.

20:21.411 --> 20:22.377
Yeah?

20:22.377 --> 20:23.413
As a ghost.

20:23.413 --> 20:25.414
As a what? As a ghost?

20:25.414 --> 20:26.449
It was crazy.

20:26.449 --> 20:27.549
That is crazy.

20:27.549 --> 20:28.684
But as soon as he saw me,

20:28.684 --> 20:30.286
he turned into energy

20:30.286 --> 20:31.554
and went into his light.

20:31.554 --> 20:32.689
Oh, well, look, Sue,

20:32.689 --> 20:34.557
I know that you were...

20:34.557 --> 20:35.892
really jazzed about getting back together

20:35.892 --> 20:36.960
with Glen or whatever.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.327
What? No I wasn't.

20:38.327 --> 20:39.561
What, you weren't?

20:39.561 --> 20:41.263
No, I just thought that having him show up

20:41.263 --> 20:43.900
for this date was my unfinished business.

20:43.900 --> 20:44.968
Turns out it wasn't,

20:44.968 --> 20:47.336
it was his.

20:47.336 --> 20:50.373
All these attempts to
figure out why I'm a ghost,

20:50.373 --> 20:54.242
they just end in disappointment.

20:54.242 --> 20:55.877
I, all right, Sue, listen...

20:55.877 --> 20:57.480
No wait, let me finish.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.249
I realized something.

21:00.249 --> 21:01.817
Going into the light

21:01.817 --> 21:03.618
will happen when it's supposed to happen.

21:03.618 --> 21:06.489
There's no use in obsessing over it.

21:06.489 --> 21:08.557
That's why I decided I'm gonna start

21:08.557 --> 21:09.625
living in the moment.

21:09.625 --> 21:10.926
That's good.

21:10.926 --> 21:12.528
I got a pretty good thing right here.

21:12.528 --> 21:14.396
You're talking about me, right?

21:14.396 --> 21:16.432
*

21:16.432 --> 21:18.567
(clears throat)

21:18.567 --> 21:19.701
All right, come on, let's go.

21:19.701 --> 21:21.237
Let's get outta here.

21:21.237 --> 21:25.237
*

21:26.909 --> 21:29.644
Oh, by the way, I hired a new housekeeper.

21:29.644 --> 21:32.448
Just ignore her, okay?

21:32.448 --> 21:33.548
Whoop, oh, I just walked you

21:33.548 --> 21:34.683
through a chair.

21:34.683 --> 21:36.551
(chuckling)

21:40.990 --> 21:44.059
*

21:44.059 --> 21:47.096
Well, all right, I tailed him all day

21:47.096 --> 21:48.530
and I gotta say, Cam,

21:48.530 --> 21:49.765
I feel like one of your assistants.

21:49.765 --> 21:50.833
Don't be silly, you're just being

21:50.833 --> 21:52.101
a really good boyfriend.

21:52.101 --> 21:53.536
If this is what your boyfriends do,

21:53.536 --> 21:54.970
you are the most high maintenance

21:54.970 --> 21:56.505
girlfriend I've ever had.

21:56.505 --> 21:57.673
What is that, chicken?

21:57.673 --> 21:59.541
Swan.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.042
Anyway, here. I didn't hear much,

22:01.042 --> 22:02.077
but I think he was on a Bluetooth

22:02.077 --> 22:03.211
talking to his lawyer.

22:03.211 --> 22:04.613
And what makes you say that?

22:04.613 --> 22:06.949
'Cause he kept on saying "sue."

22:06.949 --> 22:08.550
Sue?

22:08.550 --> 22:12.550
