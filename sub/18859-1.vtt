00:55.318 --> 00:58.436
And we are back, in living color,
with our exclusive interview

00:58.558 --> 01:02.108
with the president of the United States,
Richard Milhous Nixon.

01:04.438 --> 01:05.952
Mr. President, before the break,

01:06.078 --> 01:10.470
we were discussing the pending
impeachment investigation.

01:10.598 --> 01:12.510
And I guess we're all wondering,

01:12.638 --> 01:16.996
how are you feeling about your ability
to defend yourself against the charges?

01:28.718 --> 01:31.836
Well, that's very interesting
to hear you say that, Mr. President.

01:32.518 --> 01:34.157
It begs the question,

01:34.958 --> 01:39.510
is it paranoia
if indeed everyone is coming after you?

01:41.118 --> 01:44.077
If you can just drop it
on the floor for now. Hey, Christine.

01:44.198 --> 01:46.110
- Hey.
- Are we interrupting something?

01:46.238 --> 01:49.993
No, I... I was just running
some tape on myself.

01:50.118 --> 01:52.030
It's the new quad machine. Sorry.

01:52.158 --> 01:53.387
- Hey, Jean?
- Yeah?

01:53.518 --> 01:56.556
Have you, uh, noticed
that I do this thing when I...

01:56.718 --> 01:59.836
I nod a little too sympathetically
when I'm interviewing a subject?

02:00.438 --> 02:03.909
- No. How can you be too sympathetic?
- I don't know.

02:04.038 --> 02:05.791
It feels forced.

02:06.158 --> 02:08.627
I'm gonna cue up the interview
for the zoning piece.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.829
- Can you look at the film intro?
- Yes.

02:23.958 --> 02:26.598
After we're done here,
I need your help in the studio.

02:26.718 --> 02:29.358
- Hey, Chris. Is it cued up?
- Yes, it's cued up.

02:29.478 --> 02:31.356
Alright.

02:33.238 --> 02:35.992
- Your stomach's still acting up?
- Yeah, it's just stress.

02:37.358 --> 02:41.113
So I-I was thinking we'll go film intro,
and then go to graphics,

02:41.238 --> 02:43.036
and then jump into this.

02:43.798 --> 02:45.630
We don't need that film intro.
Let's cut it.

02:45.758 --> 02:48.148
- Are you sure?
- This is good. This is solid as it is.

02:48.278 --> 02:49.632
...at least put it to vote,

02:49.758 --> 02:52.353
because while we wait,
there are kids who are suffering.

02:52.478 --> 02:54.151
The whole of Florida suffers...

02:54.318 --> 02:55.547
Stop! Rewind.

02:56.518 --> 02:59.113
- How come?
- It's that lean-in. I wanna see it.

02:59.278 --> 03:01.713
Oh. Hey, I was wondering, um,

03:01.838 --> 03:04.512
if you have time after the show tonight,
can you take a look at something?

03:04.638 --> 03:07.551
Uh, I took your advice. I've been trying
to put a story together.

03:07.678 --> 03:09.749
Well, I have my volunteer shift,

03:09.878 --> 03:11.915
and then dinner, but tomorrow maybe?

03:12.038 --> 03:13.518
- Yeah, alright.
- OK.

03:15.118 --> 03:16.950
...or at least put it to vote,

03:17.078 --> 03:19.957
because while we wait,
there are kids who are suffering.

03:20.078 --> 03:22.274
There. Right there. Stop. See that?

03:22.398 --> 03:25.311
You don't think that's... forced?

03:25.438 --> 03:27.509
No, it's fine. You're listening to them.

03:27.638 --> 03:30.551
Have you noticed Gail has been putting
fake flowers on the table?

03:30.678 --> 03:32.271
- Yeah. Mike asked her to.
- Wayne!

03:32.438 --> 03:34.191
They're silk or something.

03:34.358 --> 03:36.714
How does our new,
very expensive quad look?

03:36.838 --> 03:38.750
Uh, don't know yet. It's still in the box.

03:38.878 --> 03:40.471
Let me know when you get it
up and running.

03:40.598 --> 03:42.555
If it doesn't work, I'm not paying for it.

03:42.678 --> 03:46.274
- Ladies, team meeting. Five minutes.
- Copy five.

03:47.078 --> 03:48.273
I mean it!

03:50.238 --> 03:52.958
- "I mean it!"
- "Five minutes, ladies."

03:54.198 --> 03:55.917
Steve, what's going on in your world?

03:56.038 --> 03:57.711
Orlando's looking at a big storm tonight.

03:57.878 --> 03:59.949
It'd be great to get another ten seconds.

04:00.078 --> 04:02.991
It's gonna have
to come in the lead, then, George.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.518
The lead-in's ten long as it is,

04:04.678 --> 04:07.068
and I got fat to trim
all over the rest of the show.

04:07.918 --> 04:09.318
OK. Keep working on it.

04:09.438 --> 04:12.158
- This just came in.
- Fire just called.

04:12.278 --> 04:14.554
Pickup truck went off the road
on Orangeville.

04:14.678 --> 04:17.671
- Chubbuck, can you get out there?
- Uh, no, sorry. I can't.

04:18.798 --> 04:20.312
What do you mean, you can't?

04:20.918 --> 04:24.355
I'm tucking in that hospital piece.
I need more time.

04:24.478 --> 04:27.516
You're shitting me. I thought
you finished with that last week.

04:27.638 --> 04:29.231
That was Part One.

04:29.358 --> 04:31.748
What is with this
zoning obsession of yours?

04:31.878 --> 04:33.915
- It's inane.
- No, it's important.

04:34.038 --> 04:35.472
People could be dying out there.

04:35.598 --> 04:38.067
Mike, it's fender-bender reporting.
It's demeaning.

04:38.198 --> 04:39.951
I have been very clear

04:40.078 --> 04:42.991
that I am doing issue-oriented
or character-based pieces.

04:43.118 --> 04:44.791
You always make it very, very clear.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.990
Thank you for your clearness.
It's too dry!

04:49.398 --> 04:51.629
We gotta liven things up around here.

04:52.318 --> 04:54.150
The ratings are in the fucking toilet.

04:54.278 --> 04:56.395
You know, I can be on that real quick.

04:56.518 --> 04:58.237
All the film rigs are out anyway.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.912
- Don't.
- Take one of the Akais.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.108
The Akais don't work.

05:01.278 --> 05:03.634
They work, Chubbuck,
you just refuse to learn them.

05:03.758 --> 05:07.035
Which reminds me,
everybody, September the 1st,

05:07.198 --> 05:10.635
everybody in this room! September the 1st.

05:10.758 --> 05:12.112
Mark it on your calendars.

05:12.238 --> 05:15.276
We are all video by then.
There's no excuses.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.388
- Yes?
- Yes.

05:16.518 --> 05:18.032
No excuses!

05:18.158 --> 05:19.877
Jean, d'you mind picking up that footage?

05:19.998 --> 05:23.150
- No, I'm on it.
- Mike, Bob's on the phone.

05:23.278 --> 05:25.952
- Bob, Ford Dealership Bob?
- No. Bob Bob.

05:26.078 --> 05:28.035
- Station owner.
- Fuck.

05:28.158 --> 05:29.831
Tell him I'll be right there.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.915
Tell him I'll call him right back.

05:33.238 --> 05:35.628
Mike, you should go take that.

05:35.758 --> 05:38.910
Probably calling to tell me he's gonna
come here to put us out of our misery.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.030
Bob Andersen deigning to visit us.

05:41.158 --> 05:42.148
That'd be something.

05:42.318 --> 05:46.392
Right. Will he be traveling
by spaceship or unicorn?

05:46.518 --> 05:49.556
OK, quick. Sports. Kirby. Go.

05:54.798 --> 05:56.790
Get your curlers out, Kirby.
We're on in 30.

05:56.958 --> 05:59.632
Thank you.
"...quarterback among his two main..."

05:59.758 --> 06:02.592
- They're gonna skip that.
- That's good. Thank you, Gail.

06:02.718 --> 06:05.358
Anytime, George.

06:07.798 --> 06:11.509
In other news, there was a car
accident on the 301 this morning.

06:11.678 --> 06:14.512
- What time do we have
Christine in the line-up? 5-20.

06:14.638 --> 06:17.551
Five, four, stand by... Take VC1.

06:17.678 --> 06:22.195
The erratic flight patterns
of a pelican. End quote.

06:22.358 --> 06:23.838
The resulting pile-up

06:23.958 --> 06:26.427
fortunately did not result
in any injuries,

06:26.558 --> 06:29.312
but did back up south-bound traffic
all the way to Somerset.

06:29.958 --> 06:32.075
Driving conditions are now normal.

06:32.198 --> 06:35.714
I've changed my mind. We need to add
a film of me walking the county line.

06:35.838 --> 06:38.194
I don't think we can.
We're up in three minutes.

06:38.318 --> 06:41.117
Goddamn it, Chubbuck!

06:41.238 --> 06:43.469
- I'll load it.
- How's that graphic looking?

06:43.598 --> 06:44.668
I don't know. I like it.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.637
The meeting
will begin promptly at 7:30 pm,

06:47.798 --> 06:50.916
and we're told that cookies and coffee
will be served.

06:51.038 --> 06:52.358
Ready, camera two.

06:52.478 --> 06:55.437
And now,
let's kick it over to Steve Turner.

06:55.598 --> 06:56.918
Moving on to weather.

06:57.038 --> 06:58.916
Just a couple of seconds off the top.
Let's go.

06:59.038 --> 07:02.190
- Cue camera two.
- Tell George to stretch.

07:02.358 --> 07:04.953
Tell George to stretch it.
Camera two, go to a two-shot.

07:05.078 --> 07:07.991
It really mucked things up
with that rainstorm last week, huh?

07:08.118 --> 07:10.917
Well, like any new technology,
it has its kinks.

07:11.038 --> 07:13.872
It just kinda makes you look
like a liar, Steve.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.433
Well, I think you know
that I'm not, George.

07:16.558 --> 07:19.517
I'd like to see you jump to the hot seat
one night. See how it feels.

07:19.638 --> 07:22.312
- That sounds like fun, actually.
- I'm sure it does.

07:22.438 --> 07:23.952
- Two.
- As always...

07:27.198 --> 07:30.396
VT1 is open, ladies.
Whenever you're ready.

07:32.038 --> 07:33.313
OK.

07:33.438 --> 07:35.157
Here.

07:35.278 --> 07:38.271
My asshole is like this right now.
It's like this.

07:38.398 --> 07:40.549
I'm going. Copy, copy.

07:40.678 --> 07:41.828
- Let's go.
- OK.

07:41.958 --> 07:44.473
Load graphic on VT1.
Load film on film two.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.794
TRT is 35 seconds. Sound on film.

07:46.918 --> 07:49.478
- Go to interview on VT2.
- Sound on film.

07:49.718 --> 07:54.270
And now, in a special edition
of the Sarasota Suncoast Digest,

07:54.398 --> 07:58.631
an ongoing investigative report
from reporter Christine Chubbuck.

07:58.758 --> 07:59.748
Christine?

07:59.878 --> 08:01.312
Thank you, George.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.430
As you know, there's been some controversy

08:04.558 --> 08:07.630
with several of the hospitals
up near Longboat Key.

08:07.798 --> 08:12.873
I sat down with councilman and
zoning Board president Tom D'Esposito

08:12.998 --> 08:14.876
and some local healthcare professionals

08:14.998 --> 08:17.752
for an exclusive interview
to talk about it

08:17.878 --> 08:22.270
and how it ties into what might be
a larger crisis in Sarasota.

08:23.598 --> 08:24.588
A zoning crisis.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.270
Projector two.

08:33.398 --> 08:35.150
You can't see,
but I'm standing on the line

08:35.278 --> 08:37.235
that divides
Manatee and Sarasota Counties.

08:37.357 --> 08:40.395
There's a proposal on the table right now

08:40.518 --> 08:42.986
to move the line up a fifth of a mile,

08:43.118 --> 08:46.714
so that the Sunshine Children's Home
and other facilities like it

08:46.878 --> 08:49.188
are eligible for more state funding.

08:49.318 --> 08:52.755
However, discussions,
like this railway track,

08:52.878 --> 08:54.597
have come to a dead end.

08:55.838 --> 08:58.956
Mr. D'Esposito, this is the fifth time
in as many months

08:59.078 --> 09:02.150
that the re-zone proposal
has gone forth before the board.

09:02.278 --> 09:04.873
Is your plan to postpone the vote again?

09:05.518 --> 09:07.510
What's your message to residents,

09:07.638 --> 09:10.073
and to the workers
at the Sunshine Children's Center,

09:10.198 --> 09:11.712
and the children in their care?

09:15.958 --> 09:20.669
# You fill up my senses

09:20.798 --> 09:24.712
# Like a night in the forest

09:25.638 --> 09:30.554
# Like a mountain in springtime

09:30.678 --> 09:35.434
# Like a walk in the rain

09:35.558 --> 09:40.428
# Like a storm in the desert

09:40.598 --> 09:44.990
# Like a sleepy blue ocean

09:45.758 --> 09:49.229
Hm, but Miss Tangerine...

09:49.398 --> 09:52.311
Yes, See Saw, darling?

09:52.438 --> 09:56.318
How do you know if it's a stranger?

09:56.438 --> 09:58.236
What do you mean?

09:59.798 --> 10:02.791
Well, what if you know them,

10:02.918 --> 10:07.117
but you don't really know them?

10:08.238 --> 10:09.718
Then what?

10:09.878 --> 10:13.838
Hm. Well, that's a tricky question,
See Saw, darling.

10:13.958 --> 10:18.589
If you've spoken to them more than once,
then they're not a stranger,

10:18.758 --> 10:21.671
and it's probably OK.

10:21.798 --> 10:23.949
Well, thank you, Miss Tangerine.

10:24.078 --> 10:26.070
You're welcome, See Saw.

10:26.198 --> 10:27.632
Thanks, kids.

10:27.758 --> 10:29.511
Thank you, kids.

10:30.758 --> 10:33.830
That was wonderful!
Can everyone thank Miss Christine?

10:33.958 --> 10:37.838
- Thank you, Miss Christine!
- Alright, dinner time, everyone.

10:37.958 --> 10:40.917
Hey, Stevie,
I have a good one for you today.

10:41.038 --> 10:42.870
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

10:42.998 --> 10:45.433
- Harry.
- Harry who?

10:45.558 --> 10:49.108
Harry up and let me in, it's cold outside.

10:49.238 --> 10:51.707
Alright, it's dinner time, kiddo.

10:51.878 --> 10:54.632
- Goodbye, Miss Christine.
- Bye, Steven.

10:54.798 --> 10:58.189
- Thanks again, Christine.
- Oh, of course.

10:59.078 --> 11:00.717
You know, I was a little torn.

11:00.838 --> 11:03.273
I know most of them
don't leave the grounds ever, so...

11:03.398 --> 11:05.037
No, it's all helpful.

11:05.158 --> 11:06.592
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:06.718 --> 11:07.754
Hey, Miranda...

11:08.318 --> 11:11.834
Uh, I've been,
I've been having these, uh...

11:12.478 --> 11:15.312
awful stomach pains, uh, right down here.

11:16.878 --> 11:19.552
Could you, uh...
Could you maybe have a look for me?

11:20.238 --> 11:23.037
Honey, I'm a pediatric nurse.
I'm not really qualified.

11:23.198 --> 11:24.632
That might be in your lady parts.

11:24.758 --> 11:26.909
You should call a doctor.

11:27.638 --> 11:29.630
Yeah, that... that makes sense.

11:29.758 --> 11:33.354
Well, it's... it's probably
just stress anyway.

11:34.998 --> 11:38.036
From the NBC News Center
in New York, this is NBC Nightly News...

11:44.958 --> 11:48.998
- Sorry I'm late, roomie.
- Oh, hey. It's OK.

11:49.118 --> 11:51.428
- Long day?
- Long day.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.670
I was stuck behind this guy on the 41.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.836
We were not moving
in the left-hand lane. It was crazy.

11:57.958 --> 12:01.315
- Don't worry about it.
- Can I have the usual?

12:03.198 --> 12:05.588
- The show was great tonight.
- It wasn't.

12:05.718 --> 12:07.789
They always put me
to the back of the line.

12:07.918 --> 12:09.432
It was great!

12:10.198 --> 12:14.238
Hey, who did the graphic
for the zoning crisis? That was wild.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.270
Yeah? Well, it was my concept.

12:16.398 --> 12:19.391
But Jean did the graphic.
I'm not very good with the tech stuff.

12:19.518 --> 12:23.717
So... how were things
with gorgeous George today?

12:24.278 --> 12:25.268
Don't be weird.

12:27.598 --> 12:29.191
We're still not speaking.

12:29.318 --> 12:31.514
- What's all this stuff?
- I know. I'm sorry.

12:31.638 --> 12:32.913
We're out of storage at work,

12:33.038 --> 12:35.792
and Frank just asked
if I could keep some of it here.

12:35.918 --> 12:37.557
Just for a week or so.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.589
Rent's due tomorrow.
Don't forget this month.

12:41.718 --> 12:43.994
I won't! Jeez!

12:46.518 --> 12:48.237
- Hey, Chris?
- Uh-huh?

12:48.798 --> 12:51.472
Thought more about what
you might wanna do on your birthday?

12:51.598 --> 12:53.555
I'm trying not to think about it.

12:53.678 --> 12:56.557
At least let me take you to dinner.
We could go to Davenport's.

12:56.678 --> 12:59.557
- Maybe you could invite George?
- I have to get to bed.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.909
Oh, come on, Chris,
I was just kidding around.

13:02.038 --> 13:03.028
No, it's fine.

13:03.158 --> 13:06.310
I just have to get up early tomorrow
to grind out a piece before Friday.

13:08.758 --> 13:10.033
Goodnight, Mom.

13:23.478 --> 13:24.958
Oh!

13:25.078 --> 13:29.550
Frank Delmonaco, Miami Action 6,
got an eight with this.

13:29.678 --> 13:32.591
An eight.
He beat out reruns of All in the Family.

13:32.718 --> 13:34.550
They got a 7.6.

13:34.678 --> 13:37.477
- You're reading the numbers now?
- I always read the numbers.

13:37.598 --> 13:40.955
- It's called rounding up.
- Why do I have to be here? I do sports.

13:41.078 --> 13:43.149
This is a team meeting.

13:44.038 --> 13:48.317
It's a simple concept, guys.
If it bleeds, it leads.

13:48.438 --> 13:51.556
There's a reason this idea is
catching fire in the culture right now.

13:51.678 --> 13:55.274
But he... They didn't show that, Mike.
They cut out just before it.

13:55.398 --> 13:57.230
If they'd had the guts
to show the whole thing,

13:57.358 --> 13:58.872
they could've doubled their rating.

13:58.998 --> 14:02.435
There aren't sniper standoffs
in Sarasota. We're not in Miami.

14:02.558 --> 14:06.074
Also, "if it bleeds, it leads"
is not some concept, Mike,

14:06.238 --> 14:10.471
it's a catchphrase that you picked up
at a conference in Cleveland last month.

14:10.598 --> 14:12.396
Chubbuck, this is not debate club.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.237
Well, this is a joke.

14:14.358 --> 14:17.669
This sort of thing, it'll make us a joke.

14:17.798 --> 14:21.633
- I gotta side with Chris on this one.
- Steve, you do weather.

14:23.798 --> 14:25.391
We're the joke, Chubbuck, OK?

14:25.518 --> 14:28.477
We're the joke. You read the numbers?

14:28.598 --> 14:31.432
Tell me, Chubbuck. Tell us all.
What did we do last month?

14:32.758 --> 14:35.114
We're drowning here, guys.

14:35.238 --> 14:37.707
ABC is not kicking in
what they promised this quarter.

14:37.838 --> 14:41.878
The last round of local ads didn't hit,
so people aren't re-upping.

14:41.998 --> 14:44.718
I know this is all
just fun and games for you.

14:44.838 --> 14:48.991
You're all just breezing through here
on your way to a national market.

14:49.118 --> 14:52.748
But the situation is getting fucking dire.

14:52.878 --> 14:55.347
Hear me when I say that.

14:56.518 --> 15:00.432
We need higher ratings.
How do we get them?

15:02.158 --> 15:05.276
Juicier stories. It's simple math, guys.

15:05.398 --> 15:07.867
That's not math, that's logic.

15:13.318 --> 15:16.675
Here we are at the fifth annual
Sarasota Strawberry Festival.

15:18.558 --> 15:22.472
- Shit. Ow.
- ...and humid with a high of 96.

15:22.598 --> 15:27.912
It's currently 75 degrees.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.953
Hey, Chubbuck.

15:31.238 --> 15:32.388
You ready?

15:32.958 --> 15:34.517
A or B?

15:35.478 --> 15:40.075
"The salmonella can seemingly be traced
to poorly packaged chicken from..."

15:40.198 --> 15:43.953
or, "The authorities believe
the salmonella originated..."?

15:45.078 --> 15:47.547
Are you OK?

15:49.238 --> 15:50.433
Why?

15:51.558 --> 15:53.436
Do I not seem OK?

15:53.558 --> 15:55.834
You're not upset about Nelson, are you?

15:55.958 --> 15:57.233
No.

15:57.358 --> 15:59.873
You can't let him get inside your head.

15:59.998 --> 16:02.991
Can he even hear himself sometimes?

16:04.518 --> 16:05.634
He just gets all grumpy,

16:05.758 --> 16:09.274
because he's got Mrs. Mike Nelson
back home waiting for him.

16:10.158 --> 16:12.070
Use the "authorities" line.

16:12.238 --> 16:15.356
Make people feel like someone's
steering the ship, you know?

16:15.478 --> 16:16.707
Yeah.

16:18.198 --> 16:19.393
You're OK?

16:20.558 --> 16:21.992
I'm OK.

16:22.478 --> 16:24.595
I'm OK, you're OK, right?

16:25.958 --> 16:27.517
Alright.

16:48.798 --> 16:50.391
...the Sarasota Strawberry Festival.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.398
Here we go, folks.
My first strawberry of the season.

17:00.598 --> 17:04.147
So, Sharon Davis, what can you tell me
about this...?

17:04.278 --> 17:08.192
Well, this is our fifth year.
We've been doing it since 1969.

17:09.478 --> 17:11.117
New in town, huh?

17:12.318 --> 17:15.231
- Yeah. Uh, uh, about a year.
- Hm.

17:15.358 --> 17:17.714
- I used to vacation here as a kid.
- Hm.

17:17.838 --> 17:19.032
Yeah.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.678
You were, uh...
You were in Boston before this, right?

17:22.798 --> 17:24.915
- Hm-hmm.
- Great city.

17:25.038 --> 17:27.314
- Yeah, but Ohio originally.
- Hm.

17:28.798 --> 17:29.993
So...

17:31.278 --> 17:33.395
How long have these pains
been going on for?

17:33.958 --> 17:37.838
- I don't know. About a month or two.
- Hm.

17:37.958 --> 17:41.588
- Probably just stress.
- Probably.

17:41.718 --> 17:43.391
But better safe than sorry, right?

17:44.278 --> 17:47.271
We'll take blood and urine,
and do a pregnancy test.

17:47.398 --> 17:49.833
A pregnancy test?

17:50.358 --> 17:53.510
OK. Sure. Whatever. Good luck with that.

17:54.318 --> 17:57.277
- Been a while, huh?
- Oh, you could say.

17:57.878 --> 18:00.268
And I think we'll do some x-rays.

18:00.398 --> 18:03.118
We'll need to schedule
a follow-up for next week. Alright?

18:04.798 --> 18:06.790
Absolutely. Whatever you need.

18:07.838 --> 18:11.149
Says here someone's
got a birthday coming up, huh?

18:11.318 --> 18:13.071
Oh, yeah, don't remind me.

18:13.198 --> 18:16.270
The big 3-0, huh?

18:18.638 --> 18:20.834
Can you put your feet up
in the stirrups, please?

18:20.958 --> 18:22.551
Oh. Sure.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.077
Alright. Now slide down.

18:26.198 --> 18:28.554
Slide your hips right down
to the edge of the table for me.

18:28.678 --> 18:31.193
- Hm-hmm.
- Thank you.

18:31.318 --> 18:35.198
From the NBC News Center
in New York, this is NBC Nightly News,

18:35.318 --> 18:37.310
reported by John Chancellor.

18:37.438 --> 18:40.158
The House Judiciary Committee
voted today to make public

18:40.278 --> 18:44.238
all the classified material
it has amassed in seven weeks

18:44.358 --> 18:47.556
into the inquiry into the impeachment
of President Nixon.

18:47.678 --> 18:51.877
The vote was 22 to 16,
with 16 Democrats and six Republicans

18:51.998 --> 18:53.990
voting to release the evidence.

18:56.558 --> 18:57.992
Anything else while you wait?

18:58.998 --> 19:00.478
No, no.

19:01.678 --> 19:03.158
Long day.

19:04.878 --> 19:08.030
- I guess I've been stood up.
- That's rough.

19:08.158 --> 19:10.832
I'll just, uh, take the check there.

19:26.038 --> 19:29.998
Hi, hi. Sorry to interrupt.

19:30.118 --> 19:33.236
I, uh, couldn't help
but, uh, notice you back there.

19:33.398 --> 19:36.152
Y-Y-You both seem
to be v-very much in love.

19:37.198 --> 19:38.678
Thanks. We are.

19:39.998 --> 19:41.557
How long have you been together?

19:42.518 --> 19:43.998
It's our third anniversary.

19:45.398 --> 19:46.878
Oh.

19:47.798 --> 19:48.993
Wow.

19:50.278 --> 19:52.668
You must think I'm crazy.
My name is Christine.

19:52.798 --> 19:57.077
I'm a reporter at WZRB, and I have
a community affairs segment

19:57.198 --> 19:58.598
called The Suncoast Digest.

19:58.758 --> 20:02.513
And I'm always on the lookout
for a positive, human-interest story.

20:02.678 --> 20:04.590
Uh... Here.

20:07.038 --> 20:09.951
Let me give you my...

20:10.078 --> 20:11.797
You wanna call me.

20:11.918 --> 20:14.638
I, uh, I can't guarantee
that you'll make it to air,

20:14.758 --> 20:18.388
but, uh, why not give it a shot, right?

20:21.398 --> 20:25.153
"OK, lady, we get it.
Let us get back to our dinner."

20:26.038 --> 20:28.075
I am... I'm real sorry to interrupt.

20:28.198 --> 20:30.554
I just... You just made my night.

20:32.438 --> 20:36.876
Don't lose sight
of what you have here. OK?

21:05.918 --> 21:07.637
Words...

21:07.758 --> 21:09.158
matter.

21:34.278 --> 21:39.831
Coffee never killed anyone.

21:55.438 --> 21:59.273
Chris? I'm so, so sorry I missed dinner.

21:59.398 --> 22:01.117
I got a little tied up at work.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.911
You could've called the restaurant.

22:03.598 --> 22:06.955
I know. I... I got a little distracted.

22:07.758 --> 22:09.795
Frank had us do an inventory.

22:10.598 --> 22:13.397
Well, you've got to learn
how to stand up to him.

22:13.558 --> 22:17.552
I know, I know. You wanna hang out?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.795
No, I think I'm gonna get to bed early.

22:21.638 --> 22:22.674
You sure?

22:22.798 --> 22:24.551
One hundred percent positive.

22:58.278 --> 23:02.113
Do better. Better, goddamn it.

23:09.678 --> 23:11.271
Can somebody grab the phone?

23:14.198 --> 23:16.588
Are you freaking out? I am freaking out.

23:16.718 --> 23:17.788
No. Why?

23:17.918 --> 23:20.831
Well, it's just the worst
possible time for this to be happening.

23:20.998 --> 23:22.478
Is your computer acting up again?

23:22.598 --> 23:25.591
My computer is more than
acting up. It's taking over my mind.

23:25.718 --> 23:28.187
I'm in the booth, talking it over
with the Japanese tech guy,

23:28.318 --> 23:29.388
and that's no small feat.

23:29.518 --> 23:31.635
"The circuits are flied."

23:31.758 --> 23:33.670
I swear, we are about
to break the whole thing wide.

23:33.798 --> 23:37.030
I'm talking countries
coming together here, Chris.

23:37.158 --> 23:39.718
And Jean busts in,
like I'm in some sort of bad dream,

23:39.838 --> 23:43.195
and tells me that I have to get out,
because Mike is giving Bob a tour,

23:43.358 --> 23:45.589
and I'm just like, "Really, Jean?"

23:45.718 --> 23:48.790
- Wait. Bob?
- Yeah.

23:48.918 --> 23:50.830
Now I gotta stand up
in front of an empty map

23:50.958 --> 23:53.996
with nothing to say
like a goddamn birthday clown!

23:54.158 --> 23:55.228
Bob Andersen?

23:55.358 --> 23:58.032
Yeah. Bob fucking Andersen.
Are we having the same conversation?

24:00.638 --> 24:02.675
Jean? Hey, Jean! Jean!

24:02.798 --> 24:04.391
Hurry.

24:04.518 --> 24:07.033
- Yeah?
- What do you know?

24:07.158 --> 24:10.754
- About what?
- About what? About Bob Andersen.

24:10.878 --> 24:12.790
Oh, nothing, really. He just came by.

24:12.918 --> 24:15.228
It's crazy, right?
I think he's with Mike right now.

24:15.358 --> 24:18.317
Hey... I keep meaning
to talk to you about something.

24:18.438 --> 24:19.428
Communication.

24:20.718 --> 24:23.438
Get someone out there.
See if we can get some shots.

24:23.558 --> 24:27.029
Did you see Bob Andersen?

24:31.278 --> 24:33.395
Yes, Chubbuck,
can I help you with something?

24:34.798 --> 24:35.834
I'm sorry.

24:35.958 --> 24:37.187
Uh...

24:38.198 --> 24:39.427
I...

24:43.278 --> 24:46.157
I just wanted to let you know
that I've been getting a lot of calls

24:46.278 --> 24:49.032
about that Strawberry Festival piece.

24:49.798 --> 24:51.790
Great! Thank you.

24:56.798 --> 24:58.437
Goodbye.

25:03.958 --> 25:06.518
I'm serious.
Are we taking a championship this year?

25:06.638 --> 25:08.357
This might be the year, George.

25:08.478 --> 25:10.390
There you have it, ladies and gentlemen,

25:10.518 --> 25:13.636
a bold prediction
from our own Andrea Kirby.

25:13.758 --> 25:15.636
And that's all we have for you, Sarasota.

25:15.758 --> 25:19.638
Stay tuned for Police Surgeon,
followed by the national news.

25:19.758 --> 25:21.317
Until tomorrow.

25:26.638 --> 25:30.234
And we are out.
Thank you, everybody. Great show.

25:30.358 --> 25:31.474
Who's thirsty?

25:31.598 --> 25:34.909
Oh, yeah, let's go
to that place across the street.

25:35.038 --> 25:37.394
Bob Andersen
was watching you from back there.

25:37.518 --> 25:38.588
Yeah, I saw him.

25:38.718 --> 25:40.789
Everybody's freaked out about it.

25:41.398 --> 25:43.117
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:43.238 --> 25:45.673
- Good one, guys.
- You too, Steve.

26:12.158 --> 26:15.230
No, I saw him wave. Did he say
anything to you? Did he talk to you?

26:15.358 --> 26:18.078
He didn't talk to anybody.
He spent the whole day with Mike.

26:25.958 --> 26:27.153
Oh.

26:28.118 --> 26:31.111
So that's how it feels to have
everyone's attention and respect?

26:31.238 --> 26:32.558
What's going on here, Mike?

26:32.678 --> 26:33.668
Calm down, Steve.

26:33.798 --> 26:35.391
What do you mean, calm down, Mike?

26:35.518 --> 26:38.352
We are talking about
all of our lives here.

26:38.478 --> 26:40.834
Why didn't you tell us that he was here?

26:40.958 --> 26:43.348
I didn't know he was coming
any more than you guys.

26:43.478 --> 26:46.630
He flew down this morning,
called me at home, asked to have lunch.

26:47.358 --> 26:49.634
Mike, are we... are we gonna be shut down?

26:52.958 --> 26:57.635
In defiance of any logic,
or common sense I can discern...

26:58.878 --> 27:02.918
he's here to see if he can poach
some on-screen talent.

27:03.558 --> 27:06.710
- What do you mean, poach?
- He's not shutting us down.

27:08.078 --> 27:12.755
He's actually picking up
another station in Baltimore. WKRB.

27:13.678 --> 27:16.671
So I guess he's doubling down
on this whole news thing.

27:17.358 --> 27:20.829
Wait, so he wants to hire one of us
to work in Baltimore?

27:21.398 --> 27:23.037
It's a top 30 market.

27:23.798 --> 27:27.872
I love how quickly you've all
moved off your fear of getting fired.

27:28.758 --> 27:29.748
If he takes one of you,

27:29.878 --> 27:32.552
it's gonna be a royal pain in the ass
for the rest of us.

27:32.678 --> 27:35.716
- Who's he gonna take?
- Steve, I have no fucking idea.

27:35.878 --> 27:38.552
But he's gonna be hanging around
for a couple of weeks,

27:38.718 --> 27:42.428
working on this and a couple of other
real-estate deals he's got going on.

27:42.558 --> 27:45.357
He's even offered
to host our 4th of July party.

27:45.478 --> 27:50.348
But believe me
when I say he'll be watching.

27:50.518 --> 27:52.794
Mike, you always host our 4th party.

27:52.918 --> 27:56.468
Yeah, well... Things are gonna be
a little different this year.

27:58.918 --> 28:00.113
Goodnight, kids.

28:01.278 --> 28:02.268
Baltimore.

28:02.958 --> 28:05.109
That's so close to New York.
That'll be huge.

28:05.238 --> 28:07.878
Maybe he'd take a couple of us.
That'd be a fun road trip.

28:11.998 --> 28:15.912
Almost half of all the meals
we now eat are junk-food meals.

28:16.038 --> 28:17.438
Hi, Mike.

28:17.558 --> 28:19.311
It's called knocking, Chubbuck.

28:20.478 --> 28:22.071
Do you have a minute?

28:25.278 --> 28:26.758
Sure.

28:26.878 --> 28:28.198
Check this out.

28:28.318 --> 28:31.117
I'm watching an Action 6 air check
from last month.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.388
They're doing a series on, uh, fat people.

28:34.518 --> 28:38.034
You know, people addicted to junk food,
you know, like Twinkies.

28:38.998 --> 28:42.309
They're trying shock therapy now.
Can you believe this?

28:42.438 --> 28:43.428
OK.

28:43.558 --> 28:45.754
We're gonna ask you do a couple of things.

28:45.878 --> 28:47.517
I'm gonna turn the machine on.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.550
At first, you're not gonna
feel anything at all.

28:49.678 --> 28:51.351
As a matter of fact,
the machine is on now.

28:51.478 --> 28:52.548
Mike, level with me.

28:54.318 --> 28:56.992
I haven't led in over a month now.

28:58.198 --> 29:00.429
Tell me what I have to do
to get to Baltimore.

29:00.558 --> 29:02.550
Why not try to get me something like this?

29:03.198 --> 29:07.715
Because this is totally at odds with
the work that I've been doing, Mike.

29:07.838 --> 29:09.750
It's exploitative.

29:10.398 --> 29:13.118
Then why are so many people watching it?

29:13.238 --> 29:15.594
The people you're so concerned
about representing

29:15.718 --> 29:18.438
are the ones
that are gobbling this stuff up.

29:18.558 --> 29:20.914
We're supposed to know better than them.

29:21.038 --> 29:23.428
That's a pretty superior attitude to take.

29:23.558 --> 29:25.754
It's on the job description.

29:25.878 --> 29:28.313
You asked me a question,
I'm answering your question.

29:28.438 --> 29:31.431
So what, get some footage of
some fat people burning in a car crash,

29:31.558 --> 29:34.835
and I'm on a plane to Baltimore,
is that what you're saying?

29:34.998 --> 29:37.558
Now you're being a smart-ass.

29:37.678 --> 29:40.591
Know what your problem is, Chubbuck?
You're a feminist.

29:40.718 --> 29:44.029
You think that the way to get ahead
is by talking louder than the other guy.

29:44.158 --> 29:46.195
That's the whole movement in a nutshell.

29:46.318 --> 29:51.188
Oh. So you're saying that I'm not fit
for a bigger market 'cause I'm a woman?

29:51.318 --> 29:54.948
No, I'm saying that there's no respect
for institutions of authority.

29:55.078 --> 29:57.957
You're the smartest person here.

29:58.078 --> 30:00.832
If you took half the energy
you use to give me a hard time,

30:00.958 --> 30:02.358
and did what I'm asking you to do...

30:02.478 --> 30:06.518
- I'm just trying to understand you.
- Jesus Christ! Make your stories juicy.

30:06.718 --> 30:11.509
But I thought people
were supposed to like me for who I am.

30:11.638 --> 30:14.551
That it's what's on the inside
that counts.

30:16.238 --> 30:21.108
They are. But you have to show them
who you are.

30:22.638 --> 30:24.470
Well, how do I do that?

30:26.918 --> 30:32.038
Well, you do it with your actions.
You act boldly and bravely.

30:33.118 --> 30:34.393
You put on nice clothes,

30:34.558 --> 30:39.075
and you wake up every day,
and you tell people who you are.

30:40.198 --> 30:42.838
You use your body language.

30:42.958 --> 30:44.950
You use your words.

30:46.838 --> 30:49.592
So what I say can count, too?

30:51.398 --> 30:52.991
Yes, it can.

30:55.078 --> 30:57.434
Sometimes it can.

31:09.598 --> 31:11.430
Thank you, Miss Christine.

31:12.318 --> 31:13.672
OK, come on.

31:13.798 --> 31:17.314
You seem bigger in real life,
a little taller.

31:17.478 --> 31:20.869
I can't believe I didn't recognize you.
Oh, don't mind him.

31:20.998 --> 31:22.990
He's on a damn drunk.

31:23.118 --> 31:25.997
Maybe I can get your autograph
on the way out, hm?

31:26.998 --> 31:30.628
Frank! You have a celebrity visitor.

31:30.758 --> 31:34.513
So I'm looking to run
some grittier stuff for my segment.

31:34.638 --> 31:36.630
Grittier? OK.

31:36.758 --> 31:40.149
Well, you know crime is on the rise.
In Sarasota last month,

31:40.278 --> 31:43.077
there were at least two armed robberies
and four burglaries.

31:43.198 --> 31:46.475
Well, that was an anomaly. If you
look at the charts, it's pretty even.

31:46.598 --> 31:49.238
I wouldn't say it's rising.

31:49.358 --> 31:53.716
Well, maybe not rising, but it is here.

31:54.518 --> 31:57.158
You know, I think people
are a little too happy to ignore it.

31:57.278 --> 32:00.908
Did something happen to someone
you know? 'Cause you can tell me.

32:01.038 --> 32:04.190
No. I... I just need to...

32:06.478 --> 32:09.118
to show the darker side of Sarasota.

32:09.278 --> 32:13.750
- Find a darker angle, you know.
- For what it's worth, Miss Chubbuck,

32:13.878 --> 32:15.756
I think your show is great.

32:16.838 --> 32:20.434
You do these think pieces.
They're so positive.

32:21.718 --> 32:23.198
I love coming on.

32:23.958 --> 32:25.438
Well, I appreciate that.

32:27.198 --> 32:29.838
Captain, people
are really listening to me.

32:30.438 --> 32:34.318
So I just need to make sure
that I'm really saying something.

33:03.518 --> 33:07.956
You know, she's paranoid and crazy, right?

33:13.798 --> 33:15.869
Oh, hi, honey.

33:18.038 --> 33:21.190
- I need a minute, Peg.
- What's in the box?

33:21.318 --> 33:23.549
Shh!

33:28.238 --> 33:29.592
Can I come in?

33:32.078 --> 33:35.230
You were smoking pot out there,
and you know how much I hate that.

33:37.198 --> 33:38.427
It's my day off.

33:39.838 --> 33:42.558
Please let me come in.
I wanna talk to you.

33:44.078 --> 33:45.592
I heard you talking about me.

33:45.718 --> 33:47.914
If you have a problem with me,
you can say it to my face.

33:48.038 --> 33:52.396
I was talking about Janice.
Janice from the Yarn Barn.

33:52.518 --> 33:54.237
I'm sure you were.

33:56.718 --> 34:00.837
Chris, will you stop looking at that?
What is that, a HAM radio?

34:00.958 --> 34:02.358
It's for work. What?

34:05.038 --> 34:09.635
I'm making shark steaks for dinner.
I was hoping to talk to you.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.193
Well, we're talking right now. What?

34:13.998 --> 34:15.318
Christine...

34:16.757 --> 34:19.556
This isn't the start of one
of your moods, is it? You can tell me.

34:19.678 --> 34:21.510
I hate to see you go through that.

34:21.638 --> 34:25.074
Peg. Jeez. Moods?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.993
- What is it?
- It's just...

34:29.757 --> 34:31.511
You're sounding a little like you sounded

34:31.638 --> 34:33.311
towards the end of your time in Boston.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.714
Yeah, well, I'm fine, OK?

34:36.558 --> 34:39.915
- What?
- I have some news.

34:41.237 --> 34:43.434
I met someone.

34:45.717 --> 34:49.757
His name is Mitch.
He came into work a few weeks ago.

34:49.878 --> 34:53.588
He, um, he lives in Bradenton.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.472
OK. What do you want me to say?

34:59.398 --> 35:01.230
I want you to be happy for me.

35:02.198 --> 35:04.554
I'd like you to meet him.

35:04.678 --> 35:09.195
Well, why don't we,
uh, give it a few weeks?

35:09.318 --> 35:12.709
Historically, these things
don't always go as planned with you.

35:15.838 --> 35:17.795
Christine, I know that's not you talking.

35:19.838 --> 35:22.273
That's whatever
you're carrying around right now.

35:23.238 --> 35:25.309
And I think you should apologize to me.

35:26.838 --> 35:28.716
Christine!

35:34.438 --> 35:38.637
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't say things like that to you.

35:42.598 --> 35:45.591
It's just that you don't even ask me
what's going on with... with... with...

35:45.718 --> 35:48.358
with George or anything.

35:48.478 --> 35:51.277
- And it's like, uh...
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:51.398 --> 35:54.038
I wanted to talk to you about it
the other day, and...

35:54.158 --> 35:56.832
And now you're telling me all this,

35:56.958 --> 35:59.314
and it, well, it just, uh,
just feels like gloating.

35:59.438 --> 36:04.832
Oh! Oh, my God, no! I'm sorry,
I should've checked in with you.

36:04.958 --> 36:09.316
Hmm. Do you really see that or are you
just saying that to shut me up?

36:09.478 --> 36:15.031
No! I can totally see
where you're coming from. OK?

36:17.118 --> 36:18.347
Can I give you a hug?

36:18.478 --> 36:20.356
- That usually seems to help.
- Yeah.

36:30.198 --> 36:33.509
Oh.

36:41.158 --> 36:42.751
Thank you.

36:44.758 --> 36:46.989
I don't think I realized
how much I needed this.

36:49.278 --> 36:51.509
Thank you.

36:51.638 --> 36:55.518
Of course, honey.
You can always talk to me.

36:55.638 --> 36:57.994
I'm your mom. That's what moms are for.

36:58.958 --> 37:00.358
OK.

37:12.558 --> 37:15.232
If you could go over
to Island Park, there's those kids

37:15.358 --> 37:17.475
that've been loitering around
the last couple of weeks.

37:17.598 --> 37:20.830
If you could shine your flashlight
or whatever. Over.

37:20.958 --> 37:22.278
32-15, show me en route.

37:22.398 --> 37:26.108
I'm at Fifth and Pineapple now,
headed back toward Main.

37:28.358 --> 37:32.270
Did you get that 11-20 under control
or whatever that was? What was that?

37:32.398 --> 37:34.833
32-15, yeah. Just a couple of kids.

37:34.958 --> 37:38.998
We kind of flashed the lights,
pulled up and they took off.

37:39.118 --> 37:41.508
You wanna hear something
on a happier note?

37:43.558 --> 37:45.390
Yeah, please do.

37:47.838 --> 37:51.468
I finally touched
Marie's pussy last night.

37:54.678 --> 37:57.273
What else is going on?
I'm bored out of my fucking mind.

37:58.078 --> 37:59.114
What can I say?

37:59.238 --> 38:02.197
I hate my job, I hate my family,
I hate my fucking brother.

38:04.158 --> 38:07.276
Now we're getting somewhere.
Now you're opening up.

38:07.398 --> 38:11.153
10-21, 32-15, 32-75, 32-50,

38:11.278 --> 38:14.237
respond to a 10-55 in progress
at Sycamore and Orange.

38:14.358 --> 38:16.748
Sycamore and Orange,
there's a 10-55 in progress.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.471
Sycamore and Orange.

38:18.598 --> 38:20.954
- 32-15, show me en route.
- Yes. I'll come and get you.

38:28.558 --> 38:31.676
This is so exciting.
I feel like Bob Woodward.

38:31.798 --> 38:34.711
- Uh-huh.
- Is this for the zoning crisis?

38:34.838 --> 38:38.957
I am not exactly sure yet, Jean.
We will find out.

38:41.078 --> 38:42.512
What's going on?

38:43.198 --> 38:45.315
- A fire.
- Oh, my God. Is that a fire?

38:45.438 --> 38:49.273
Yeah. Find where
the good angles are, Jean.

38:49.398 --> 38:51.310
Copy. You want the Auricon or the Akai?

38:51.438 --> 38:54.590
Uh, Auricon. Auricon, color film.

38:54.718 --> 38:57.074
I have a feeling
this is going to be special.

39:04.118 --> 39:06.155
Hello, sir. Christine Chubbuck.

39:06.318 --> 39:08.230
I'm a reporter at WZRB.

39:08.918 --> 39:11.956
This is some fire.
Can you tell me how it got started?

39:12.878 --> 39:14.870
I really don't know for sure.

39:15.038 --> 39:17.428
I just know bad things
have been happening to me.

39:18.278 --> 39:22.511
OK, OK. Can, uh, can you stay here
for... for one second?

39:22.638 --> 39:24.357
I will be right back. Jean?

39:25.918 --> 39:27.193
- Chris.
- Jean.

39:27.318 --> 39:30.072
I'll get an establishing of the trailer.
You want to check framing?

39:30.198 --> 39:32.918
No. We don't need it.
We, uh, we need to shoot this guy.

39:33.038 --> 39:36.668
OK, but... we can frame him up
with the fire behind him.

39:36.798 --> 39:40.235
No, we have to frame up on his face.
Real close.

39:41.558 --> 39:44.630
I didn't know I fell asleep last night
with a cigarette in my hand.

39:45.718 --> 39:50.793
Um... But I do check the smoke...
smoke detector quite regular.

39:51.718 --> 39:54.108
I'm grateful my wife got me
into that habit.

39:55.718 --> 39:57.391
I woke up. I heard the alarm go off.

39:57.518 --> 40:01.273
I ran quickly outside to the front lawn.

40:01.398 --> 40:03.913
Realized I forgot my cigarettes.

40:04.038 --> 40:05.631
And I ran back in.

40:05.798 --> 40:11.032
And when I ran to the kitchen,
two canisters exploded and ignited.

40:11.158 --> 40:13.912
And that's how I did this.

40:23.238 --> 40:25.150
You know...

40:26.558 --> 40:28.709
That's the third time
this happened this year.

40:30.398 --> 40:32.276
I hope they don't, but, uh...

40:32.918 --> 40:36.195
I think they're gonna cancel
my homeowner's insurance tomorrow.

40:39.358 --> 40:45.150
A man driven back into a burning house
by a primal need to feed an addiction.

40:45.278 --> 40:48.032
An entire community imperiled.

40:48.678 --> 40:50.749
A sad story,

40:50.878 --> 40:52.756
but not one without hope.

40:52.878 --> 40:54.437
What does it mean?

40:55.278 --> 40:59.113
Real Floridians. Real stories.

40:59.238 --> 41:02.390
This is Christine Chubbuck
with your Suncoast Digest.

41:02.558 --> 41:04.754
Thank you, Christine, for that story.

41:06.678 --> 41:10.433
Next up after the break,
the sports report with Andrea Kirby.

41:10.558 --> 41:15.553
And after that, sales of lemons
are on the rise in Western Florida.

41:15.678 --> 41:18.068
Bad cars from bad dealers.

41:18.198 --> 41:20.588
A special report on
what's looking like an epidemic.

41:20.718 --> 41:24.837
And... we're on a break, guys.
Back in 60 seconds.

41:28.358 --> 41:30.554
Hey, Mike. What do you think?

41:30.678 --> 41:32.829
I was trying to tap
into some real suffering.

41:32.958 --> 41:36.554
It wasn't a story. The guy burned
himself going back in for cigarettes.

41:37.198 --> 41:40.032
Mike, that's exactly
what you've been asking for. It was...

41:40.158 --> 41:42.718
It was raw,
and the man had an irony to him.

41:42.838 --> 41:45.831
We're not making irony, we're making news.

41:45.958 --> 41:48.871
I mean, where was any footage
of the smoldering house?

41:48.998 --> 41:51.832
At least that would be something.
You just showed his face.

41:51.958 --> 41:53.472
But his face was burnt!

41:53.598 --> 41:57.592
You showed a guy talking.
Mumbling, actually.

41:59.278 --> 42:03.318
Guys, I got to get out of here early.
Go pick up my wife for the party.

42:03.438 --> 42:07.910
I'll see you all at Bob's.
No-shows will be fired!

42:08.718 --> 42:10.949
Darren, you're in charge!

42:16.158 --> 42:20.391
That guy was a real pistol, huh?
That was real different, Chris.

42:20.518 --> 42:23.397
It wasn't supposed to be different,
it was supposed to be good.

42:26.118 --> 42:28.428
And we're back in 30 seconds, guys!

42:28.558 --> 42:30.789
From the whole gang here at WZRB...

42:30.918 --> 42:34.116
Happy 4th of July, Sarasota!

42:34.278 --> 42:35.678
Yeah!

43:17.438 --> 43:19.748
Andrea, welcome to the party.

43:19.878 --> 43:22.393
I don't know if you remember me,
but I'm Michael's wife.

43:22.518 --> 43:24.475
Yeah. Of course, I remember you.

43:26.558 --> 43:30.472
Have you seen this place?
It's like their second or third house.

43:30.598 --> 43:32.510
I mean, it just sits here
most of the year.

43:32.638 --> 43:34.118
I mean...

43:34.998 --> 43:36.910
It's just wild.

43:37.038 --> 43:39.917
- Oh, God. Are you OK?
- I'm so sorry.

43:40.038 --> 43:41.950
- Damn it. Every goddamn time.
- Sorry.

43:42.078 --> 43:44.149
Come over here, and drink some coffee.

43:44.278 --> 43:45.553
Stop it.

43:52.958 --> 43:56.076
Uh-oh, here comes trouble!

43:56.198 --> 43:57.996
Steve's had a few.

43:58.118 --> 43:59.472
Jean...

43:59.598 --> 44:02.796
How bad was that? Honestly?

44:02.918 --> 44:05.149
I liked how it came together.

44:05.278 --> 44:07.315
I-I thought Mike was way too hard on you.

44:07.438 --> 44:08.633
You don't think that...

44:08.758 --> 44:11.353
You don't think that Bob Andersen
was watching, do you?

44:11.478 --> 44:12.673
I don't know.

44:13.358 --> 44:16.112
But it was good. Don't worry about it.

44:16.238 --> 44:18.150
Hey, Turner, you keeping it together?

44:19.398 --> 44:20.627
You know what, George?

44:21.678 --> 44:23.032
- One of these days...
- Yeah?

44:23.158 --> 44:24.672
I'm gonna test you.

44:24.798 --> 44:27.438
Yeah, I'm gonna give you the test,
you'll see.

44:27.598 --> 44:30.670
- Well, I'll study.
- Hmm. You should.

44:30.798 --> 44:32.915
- I will.
- Good.

44:33.038 --> 44:35.678
Hey, Chubbuck,
I found a pool table in the den.

44:36.318 --> 44:38.549
- Good.
- Come on.

44:40.278 --> 44:42.110
What? Uh...

44:45.718 --> 44:47.277
OK.

44:51.078 --> 44:52.637
Here you go, Mr. Andersen.

45:02.598 --> 45:04.715
That is not Andrea!

45:08.998 --> 45:11.593
Now that was some report you gave today.

45:11.718 --> 45:13.755
Uh, thank you, George.

45:15.878 --> 45:19.554
Strange. Interesting. I liked it.

45:21.118 --> 45:23.997
OK. Tell that to Mike.

45:24.718 --> 45:26.789
Jeez, just take the compliment, Chubbuck.

45:26.918 --> 45:29.353
It's good stuff you do in the field.

45:29.478 --> 45:32.312
I wish I could get out there
and do something like that.

45:32.438 --> 45:33.713
Make an impression.

45:33.838 --> 45:36.990
No one on anchor wants to be in the field.

45:37.118 --> 45:39.030
That's what people in the field think.

45:41.278 --> 45:43.634
Still stripes.

45:45.438 --> 45:47.828
You and I have been working together
for over a year now,

45:47.958 --> 45:50.189
and we've never gone out
and had a drink together.

45:51.758 --> 45:54.273
Well, I don't really drink.

45:54.438 --> 45:55.997
Well, you know what I mean.

45:57.238 --> 45:58.991
Well, you've never asked me.

46:00.998 --> 46:03.911
You're not always the most
approachable person, Chubbuck.

46:05.678 --> 46:07.237
Well, I am approachable.

46:07.358 --> 46:10.635
Maybe you just don't know
how to approach me.

46:10.758 --> 46:12.590
Oh? And who does know how to approach you?

46:12.718 --> 46:16.837
A lot of people. Jean, Steve.

46:25.358 --> 46:26.838
You're funny, Chubbuck.

46:30.718 --> 46:32.437
People are just so funny.

46:35.198 --> 46:36.712
I mean, take Mike and Mrs. Nelson.

46:36.838 --> 46:39.751
Something drew them
to each other, you know? But now?

46:40.958 --> 46:42.597
God.

46:46.478 --> 46:50.392
It's like we all have
these different versions of ourselves

46:50.518 --> 46:52.510
competing to be the real us.

46:56.078 --> 46:57.956
You ever think about stuff like that?

46:59.278 --> 47:02.237
That was George McCrae's "Rock Your Baby".

47:02.358 --> 47:03.553
Your turn.

47:03.678 --> 47:05.954
Coming up we've got Sonny and Cher,

47:06.078 --> 47:08.434
"I'm Leaving It All Up to You".

47:13.838 --> 47:15.716
I don't think I'm very good at this.

47:19.238 --> 47:21.548
Sometimes I'll be daydreaming at work...

47:23.318 --> 47:25.549
and I'll just gaze off,

47:25.678 --> 47:28.989
and imagine, like, this big wad
of shoelaces, you know?

47:30.718 --> 47:32.198
Like in a box.

47:32.958 --> 47:34.472
All tangled up.

47:36.718 --> 47:38.516
Different colors, too.

47:39.158 --> 47:43.198
Grey, black, red, neon orange.

47:45.638 --> 47:47.516
It's a big ugly knot.

47:50.038 --> 47:51.233
And that's...

47:53.718 --> 47:55.198
my life.

47:59.598 --> 48:02.067
I don't think we're so different,
you and me, Chubbuck.

48:04.878 --> 48:08.030
I think sometimes maybe we make things
too hard on ourselves.

48:10.718 --> 48:15.747
I think you and I might have...
something to offer one another.

48:18.038 --> 48:20.109
You know we're not alone out there.

48:24.958 --> 48:27.712
Well, hello, you two.

48:27.878 --> 48:30.234
- Hey, soldier. Did you just get here?
- Hm-hmm.

48:31.518 --> 48:36.638
I-I have, uh...
a lot of work to be doing so...

48:37.758 --> 48:39.750
I should... I should go.

48:39.878 --> 48:42.154
Chubbuck, just admit
this was a little fun.

48:42.278 --> 48:43.837
Sure. Goodnight, George.

48:43.958 --> 48:46.632
- So what's the game?
- Pool, dummy.

48:51.958 --> 48:53.517
Uh, happy 4th, Mr. Andersen.

48:53.638 --> 48:55.630
Chubbuck, aren't you gonna stay and watch?

48:55.758 --> 48:58.830
Uh, no, I... I have
to say goodbye to someone.

48:58.958 --> 49:00.597
The fireworks are starting.

49:28.158 --> 49:29.638
Mom?

49:30.838 --> 49:32.557
Are you home?

49:43.438 --> 49:46.237
I'm telling you, man,
you got to take it to Tug.

49:46.358 --> 49:48.589
I don't trust an outside guy with my gun,

49:48.718 --> 49:50.710
especially not Tug Daiss.

49:51.478 --> 49:53.197
It's pronounced "dice".

49:57.198 --> 50:00.669
It's the Daiss Auto Service Center.

50:00.798 --> 50:03.757
You've never seen the "Daiss"
on the side of the building?

50:04.038 --> 50:05.358
I dunno about that guy.

50:05.518 --> 50:08.272
He fixes cars, he fixes guns,
he just fixes stuff.

50:08.438 --> 50:10.828
It's like if I had a sandwich shop
and you came in and I was like,

50:10.958 --> 50:12.995
"Today we're selling blowjobs."

50:18.398 --> 50:20.515
That's why you see him.

50:20.638 --> 50:24.951
He's crazy. He's a real character.
His stories are fuckin' hilarious.

50:26.478 --> 50:27.753
I don't find him hilarious.

50:27.918 --> 50:29.955
I find him pretty disturbing,
to be honest.

50:32.238 --> 50:35.231
That is the Tug Show, my friend.

50:35.358 --> 50:37.395
Look, he's there from four to eight.

50:37.518 --> 50:39.157
You do what you wanna do.

50:39.718 --> 50:43.029
Anyway, let me tell you how it went
with Betty last night, alright?

50:43.158 --> 50:45.275
So we go back to her place, but, um...

50:45.398 --> 50:48.675
She's raring to go, you know.

51:55.038 --> 51:57.314
I-I-I thought I-I was just stressed.

51:57.438 --> 51:59.270
Is it from stress?

51:59.398 --> 52:03.312
It's hard to say. It could be.
It could be genetic.

52:03.998 --> 52:08.754
As we get older, our bodies
do things to us that we can't control.

52:08.878 --> 52:13.395
Alright, well, I-I have been stressed.

52:13.518 --> 52:17.558
You know, if you're stressed,
we can give you something for that.

52:18.758 --> 52:20.351
Give me something?

52:20.478 --> 52:22.709
You used to take trazodone
as an antidepressant.

52:22.838 --> 52:25.990
I didn't like the way
that they made me feel, OK?

52:26.158 --> 52:28.992
And, uh, I would really appreciate it
if we could stay on topic.

52:29.118 --> 52:31.917
This is very... unexpected.

52:33.278 --> 52:37.192
Look, it's great we caught it so early.
It's very manageable at this stage.

52:37.318 --> 52:40.550
We just... We need to take it out
in the next few months.

52:40.718 --> 52:43.313
- The cyst?
- The whole ovary.

52:44.438 --> 52:46.998
It's the only way
to make sure the issue doesn't recur.

52:47.118 --> 52:48.757
But it's a very manageable surgery.

52:48.878 --> 52:51.029
It's tantamount
to having your tonsils out.

52:51.998 --> 52:54.911
The only issue is, of course,
it can create complications

52:55.038 --> 52:57.633
should you want to conceive in the future.

53:01.118 --> 53:03.269
Are... are you saying

53:03.398 --> 53:07.995
that, uh, if I have this treated that I...

53:08.158 --> 53:09.592
that I won't be able to have ch...

53:09.718 --> 53:11.994
That I... That I have two months
to have a baby?

53:13.118 --> 53:17.271
I'm not saying that at all.
Now, you will only have one ovary,

53:17.398 --> 53:22.154
so, it just... might require
a little coordination.

53:23.158 --> 53:25.229
We want our residents to partake,

53:25.358 --> 53:28.908
but they need to get on
that waiting list quickly.

53:29.038 --> 53:30.631
We can't help it if we've turned this

53:30.758 --> 53:35.150
into an attractive destination
for retirees and non-retirees alike.

53:35.278 --> 53:37.270
You know Florida
is the place you want to be.

53:37.438 --> 53:39.714
We've got sun, sand, surf,

53:39.838 --> 53:42.307
championship golf, great cuisine, culture.

53:42.438 --> 53:43.838
Everything you could imagine.

53:43.958 --> 53:46.029
And everybody wants
to come here right now.

53:46.198 --> 53:49.316
- People are coming here from...
- Can we stop for a second. Jean?

53:49.438 --> 53:51.077
- Yes.
- Jean? Stop.

53:51.198 --> 53:53.030
Can you... can you... can you get Gail?

53:53.158 --> 53:55.957
I thought she was meant
to get some fresh flowers.

53:56.078 --> 53:58.877
Oh, yeah, I told her to.
It must've slipped her mind.

53:58.998 --> 54:02.833
It slipped her mind? Well, I can't think
about anything else. Sorry.

54:02.958 --> 54:06.952
You're gonna have to...
Someone get some fresh flowers!

54:11.318 --> 54:12.957
OK, um, I'm sorry, sir.

54:13.078 --> 54:16.628
We're just gonna have to wait
a little bit. I'm sorry.

54:22.518 --> 54:23.838
I'll be right back.

54:26.478 --> 54:27.753
Chris?

54:29.438 --> 54:30.918
Hey, Chris.

54:31.638 --> 54:33.072
Are you OK?

54:33.598 --> 54:35.590
Yeah, yeah.

54:36.438 --> 54:39.112
It's just, uh... summer allergies.

54:39.238 --> 54:40.558
Oh.

54:41.518 --> 54:44.317
But... are you, you know...

54:44.438 --> 54:45.588
OK?

54:45.758 --> 54:46.908
What do you mean?

54:48.318 --> 54:51.948
Well, you just seem
a little more wound up than usual.

54:53.118 --> 54:54.518
What do you mean?

54:57.718 --> 55:00.517
- Like, tense.
- No.

55:00.638 --> 55:02.436
You said "more than usual."

55:03.398 --> 55:08.757
Well, a little. But you just seemed like
you got really upset out there.

55:11.158 --> 55:14.071
Hey... Do you wanna get out of here?

55:14.838 --> 55:16.067
Where?

55:16.798 --> 55:19.108
Why don't we just go play hookie?

55:19.238 --> 55:20.718
Jean, don't be weird.

55:20.878 --> 55:24.189
I'm serious. When I get bummed out,

55:24.318 --> 55:27.072
I like to go eat ice cream.
It's this little trick I learned.

55:27.198 --> 55:30.669
When things are starting to be too much,
I just get a cone, and...

55:31.678 --> 55:34.591
This is gonna sound stupid,
but I sing, you know,

55:34.718 --> 55:38.553
along with a song on the radio
or whatever, it doesn't even matter.

55:39.358 --> 55:41.077
Look, come on. It's my treat.

55:47.278 --> 55:49.076
I have a lot of work
to be getting on with,

55:49.238 --> 55:51.036
so I should do that.

55:51.198 --> 55:53.315
I should get on with my work.

55:53.438 --> 55:56.237
And, uh, I'm sorry. Sorry, but, uh...

55:56.358 --> 55:59.396
Can you sign the Akai out for me?

55:59.518 --> 56:01.714
- Alright.
- I need to learn it.

56:01.878 --> 56:04.598
And, you know what?
I'll just... I'll go get the flowers.

56:04.718 --> 56:07.278
- OK.
- Uh, sir?

56:07.398 --> 56:11.278
I'm very sorry, and we will
pick this up at a later date.

56:11.398 --> 56:12.832
OK, thanks, Christine.

56:51.078 --> 56:54.389
My source at the police station
called it the Tug Show, actually.

56:54.518 --> 56:56.237
- He said that?
- Yes, he did.

56:56.358 --> 57:01.069
And, uh, how did you get into this?
Into this business with the police?

57:01.198 --> 57:04.828
Officer Jimmy Suskind comes out here
with a busted-up cop car,

57:04.958 --> 57:07.951
starts fiddling with his pistol,
says it doesn't shoot straight.

57:08.078 --> 57:10.638
I said, "Alright, give me
your keys and your pistol."

57:10.758 --> 57:12.511
He said,
"I ain't gonna give you my pistol."

57:12.638 --> 57:14.834
I said, "I'll take it for one day,
get it fixed for you.

57:14.958 --> 57:18.429
I'll have it shooting
straighter than a pecker in a peepshow."

57:18.558 --> 57:20.277
He says, "Alright."

57:20.398 --> 57:23.994
Madman, take care of the front office.
I gotta take care of a little business.

57:26.198 --> 57:31.034
Here we go. There you are.
Come on in. This is it.

57:41.198 --> 57:45.590
And, um... All of these guns,
they belong to other people?

57:45.718 --> 57:48.187
About half of 'em
I'm working on for other people.

57:48.958 --> 57:52.508
Others I sell to friends.
The rest of 'em are mine, though.

57:53.718 --> 57:54.834
Um...

57:55.678 --> 57:58.512
Uh, how about, uh, that one there?

57:58.638 --> 58:00.311
- What's that?
- What, that one there?

58:00.438 --> 58:02.634
What, that bad boy?

58:03.518 --> 58:07.398
- Look at that. That's a.44.
- Oh.

58:07.518 --> 58:11.034
Yeah, it's loud. It's got a big kick.

58:11.158 --> 58:14.993
It's got a lot of weight to it.
It's a damn monster.

58:15.118 --> 58:16.837
- Here, hold it.
- Really?

58:16.958 --> 58:20.235
Oh, yeah. Come on.
It ain't loaded or nothing.

58:23.118 --> 58:24.188
There you go.

58:29.718 --> 58:32.358
Oh... Holy cow, that's heavy.

58:33.078 --> 58:34.592
Here.

58:34.718 --> 58:38.871
I had no idea that
so many people carried guns down here.

58:39.598 --> 58:43.194
Oh, sure. Now this is a.38 special.

58:43.318 --> 58:45.071
My momma carried that in her purse.

58:45.198 --> 58:47.667
It aims for shit,
but it's good for close contact.

58:47.798 --> 58:48.788
- Hm-hmm.
- Yeah.

58:48.958 --> 58:52.474
We just got bullets for those,
called wadcutters.

58:52.598 --> 58:55.113
They explode on contact.

58:55.238 --> 58:57.469
Stop a threat dead in its tracks.

58:58.638 --> 59:03.076
I didn't know that Sarasota
was a town known for its threats.

59:03.198 --> 59:05.394
Oh, yeah, there's threats everywhere.

59:05.558 --> 59:09.393
There's a fever settling
into this country, Miss Chubbuck.

59:09.518 --> 59:10.998
Can't you feel it?

59:11.118 --> 59:14.873
I mean, you gotta be ready
to protect yourself. Be aware.

59:14.998 --> 59:17.194
You're living in Condition White.

59:18.678 --> 59:20.158
Condition White?

59:20.718 --> 59:24.109
When you're sleeping.
When you're home, tucked in your covers.

59:24.238 --> 59:26.116
Condition White sounds nice.

59:26.238 --> 59:30.278
Oh, it's a victim's mentality.
Condition White is for sheep.

59:32.478 --> 59:36.108
Condition Yellow, that's when you are
aware of your surroundings.

59:36.238 --> 59:38.434
You're Yellow when you leave the house.

59:38.558 --> 59:41.073
There's a bird. There's a car.

59:41.678 --> 59:44.637
Most people live and die
in White and Yellow.

59:44.758 --> 59:47.910
Carrying a gun on you
usually jumps you right up to Orange.

59:48.958 --> 59:52.747
And that's the next level.
That's where you wanna be.

59:52.878 --> 59:56.792
That's when you're aware
of your surroundings and of threats.

59:57.718 --> 59:58.913
And...

59:59.638 --> 01:00:02.472
Well, what happens after Orange?

01:00:03.598 --> 01:00:04.998
Well, that's Red.

01:00:05.158 --> 01:00:08.310
That's when you see the threat,
and you're ready to take an action.

01:00:09.838 --> 01:00:13.195
You carry one of these around
with you for a few weeks.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:14.991
You'll see.

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:16.958
Changes things.

01:01:24.358 --> 01:01:25.917
Let me tell you, please!

01:01:58.078 --> 01:01:59.478
Hi. You've reached Jean Reed.

01:01:59.598 --> 01:02:01.954
I'm probably not here, or if I am, I'm...

01:02:06.038 --> 01:02:08.872
That's great, Wayne.
Re-rack it. Cue it up for preview.

01:02:08.998 --> 01:02:10.114
Will do.

01:02:13.558 --> 01:02:15.311
- Is Mike in his office?
- Yeah.

01:02:17.438 --> 01:02:19.157
Oh, that is a great shot.

01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:20.348
Yeah, I thought so.

01:02:20.478 --> 01:02:24.233
The shoe's been in evidence for a year,
with blood all over it. They missed it.

01:02:24.358 --> 01:02:25.838
- I love it. I love it.
- Yeah.

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:27.952
You've got some pep in your step.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.957
I think I've got something.
Look out for it.

01:02:35.198 --> 01:02:38.874
Michael, I have some footage
that you need to see right now.

01:02:38.998 --> 01:02:41.149
I think it's really
gonna blow your hair back.

01:02:41.318 --> 01:02:44.868
We're always fighting, but I actually
think that we're saying the same thing.

01:02:44.998 --> 01:02:47.593
You want flash and pizzazz,
and that's fine.

01:02:47.718 --> 01:02:50.517
You know what?
Who am I to say that's not OK?

01:02:50.638 --> 01:02:53.153
There's drama and tragedy
and suffering all around us.

01:02:53.278 --> 01:02:56.749
I just wanna get to know these issues
and the people behind them.

01:02:56.878 --> 01:02:58.995
We need to put it in context, you know?

01:02:59.118 --> 01:03:02.111
The mistake we've been making
is not doubling down on the idea.

01:03:02.238 --> 01:03:05.117
We need to go deeper.
Wayne? Where's Wayne? Wayne!

01:03:05.238 --> 01:03:06.433
I don't follow you.

01:03:06.558 --> 01:03:10.188
I am saying let's get rid
of this pedestrian idea of the news,

01:03:10.318 --> 01:03:13.197
so-and-so did such-and-such
at this place and time.

01:03:13.318 --> 01:03:16.470
It's so cold. Let's really examine it.

01:03:16.598 --> 01:03:19.750
There's a subjectivity to those stories
that we're not tapping into.

01:03:19.878 --> 01:03:22.438
We need to go inside people's homes.

01:03:22.558 --> 01:03:24.834
Really spend some time with them.
Plant cameras.

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:29.157
Heck, give them the camera, so we can
see what goes on behind closed doors,

01:03:29.278 --> 01:03:30.678
'cause that is the big question

01:03:30.798 --> 01:03:33.074
that we're running around here
trying to answer.

01:03:33.198 --> 01:03:35.633
What would it be like to be someone else?

01:03:35.758 --> 01:03:38.830
They did this, Chubbuck
and it was called American Family.

01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:42.036
- It was on PBS last year.
- Oh, I've thought about that, Mike.

01:03:42.158 --> 01:03:44.468
Wayne? I need you... Wayne.

01:03:45.198 --> 01:03:47.588
So I'm thinking long form docu-journalism

01:03:47.758 --> 01:03:51.468
with little... little movies
to fill in the gaps.

01:03:51.638 --> 01:03:54.233
- Movies on the news?
- Yes.

01:03:54.358 --> 01:03:55.553
Wayne, Wayne, come on.

01:03:55.678 --> 01:03:58.068
- Stand by. I'm coming.
- Cue it up.

01:03:59.318 --> 01:04:01.674
People just watch stuff, Mike.

01:04:01.798 --> 01:04:04.916
You know, a never-ending parade of stuff

01:04:05.038 --> 01:04:08.748
to distract themselves
from their miserable lives.

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:13.350
So I mocked up something like
a domestic dispute and a home invasion.

01:04:13.478 --> 01:04:14.628
You know... Uh...

01:04:16.518 --> 01:04:19.716
It's a little... It's a little rough.
So, uh, try to follow me here.

01:04:28.118 --> 01:04:32.112
The door is unlocked. Hm.

01:04:36.438 --> 01:04:39.397
Hey, you never leave the door unlocked.

01:04:41.918 --> 01:04:43.034
Are you home?

01:04:43.158 --> 01:04:46.071
What you're seeing here
is a sort of dramatic rendering

01:04:46.198 --> 01:04:47.552
of the moment a roommate comes home

01:04:47.678 --> 01:04:49.954
and realizes her friend isn't home
when she should be.

01:04:50.078 --> 01:04:52.832
She's usually home by nine o'clock.

01:04:54.478 --> 01:04:56.595
This is based on that case last year

01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:58.835
where that girl in Reno was abducted
from her dorm room,

01:04:58.998 --> 01:05:01.752
and no one reported it for over a week.

01:05:01.878 --> 01:05:05.076
We've got more standard talking-head
interview, which will go right in front.

01:05:05.198 --> 01:05:06.678
But then we just jump into this.

01:05:06.838 --> 01:05:08.795
We don't make a big thing out of it.
We just do it.

01:05:08.918 --> 01:05:10.113
What is that, a knife?

01:05:10.238 --> 01:05:11.638
What am I looking at?

01:05:11.798 --> 01:05:13.994
The exposure's off. We'll adjust that.

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:15.871
Jean wouldn't come out
and run camera with me.

01:05:15.998 --> 01:05:17.671
It's a little too much to do
for one person.

01:05:17.798 --> 01:05:19.596
Christine!

01:05:20.278 --> 01:05:23.510
- Why are you even here?
- Look, Chubbuck, this is...

01:05:25.078 --> 01:05:28.788
interesting, but I think you need
to, uh, develop the idea more.

01:05:29.518 --> 01:05:32.716
I'm punting the Chicken Lady tonight.
Why don't you take the rest of...?

01:05:32.838 --> 01:05:35.797
If you're punting Chicken Lady anyway,
I should go on and announce it.

01:05:35.918 --> 01:05:37.955
Jesus Christ! I'm punting the Chicken Lady

01:05:38.118 --> 01:05:40.428
to make room
for the serial killer from Gainesville.

01:05:40.558 --> 01:05:43.278
- It's gonna lead.
- What?

01:05:45.078 --> 01:05:46.558
Who?

01:05:47.638 --> 01:05:52.508
Young Jean Reed here. She's been working
as an extracurricular activity.

01:05:53.078 --> 01:05:56.276
Doing really good work. Real grisly.

01:05:56.398 --> 01:05:59.391
- Exclusive stuff, too.
- I tried to tell you about it. I swear.

01:05:59.558 --> 01:06:01.311
Is this a joke?

01:06:02.078 --> 01:06:05.116
We do local news. Gainesville isn't local.

01:06:05.238 --> 01:06:08.675
He's at large. He could be anywhere.

01:06:10.038 --> 01:06:11.916
Well, I didn't know those were the rules.

01:06:12.038 --> 01:06:16.510
There's no rule book, Chubbuck.
And I don't need your permission.

01:06:16.638 --> 01:06:18.197
Excuse me.

01:06:26.038 --> 01:06:28.234
I never wanted
to do the chicken story anyway!

01:06:28.358 --> 01:06:30.429
Good. I'm glad we agree.

01:06:31.478 --> 01:06:33.993
You know, Mike, just because
your wife has a drinking problem

01:06:34.118 --> 01:06:36.075
doesn't mean
that you get to treat me like this!

01:06:36.198 --> 01:06:39.191
That's on you!
Don't put it on me! That's on you!

01:06:39.318 --> 01:06:42.038
I'm trying to do my best
for this station! And it isn't easy!

01:06:42.158 --> 01:06:45.913
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:46.038 --> 01:06:49.395
You fucked up. Again!
And now you insult me?

01:06:49.518 --> 01:06:50.998
You insult my family?

01:06:51.118 --> 01:06:53.713
You know, I got half my savings
invested in this station.

01:06:53.838 --> 01:06:56.797
I believe in it. What do you believe in?

01:06:56.918 --> 01:06:59.353
What are you doing to make a mark?

01:07:12.478 --> 01:07:14.197
OK.

01:07:15.518 --> 01:07:17.589
I'll do the Chicken Lady.

01:07:18.798 --> 01:07:20.915
But there's gonna have
to be some changes around here.

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:23.234
Christine! Go home!

01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:33.032
Have you even seen the flowers
that Gail has put out for us?

01:07:34.038 --> 01:07:37.395
They're fake, Mike. Just fake!

01:07:37.518 --> 01:07:39.635
Sums up the whole operation!

01:07:39.758 --> 01:07:41.431
Running our own cameras in the field.

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:43.550
We're a joke, Mike! We're not real!

01:07:43.678 --> 01:07:45.237
We're a joke!

01:07:45.358 --> 01:07:47.554
I don't know
what is going on with you right now,

01:07:47.678 --> 01:07:50.398
but you need to get the fuck out of here!

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:03.395
Chris, what happened?

01:08:04.678 --> 01:08:06.158
You OK?

01:08:07.518 --> 01:08:10.909
I'll have the complete
weather picture for you at 5:20

01:08:11.038 --> 01:08:13.678
on Channel 30 Weather Watch.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:17.348
Watch yourself, Sarasota,
with the Channel 30 News team.

01:08:17.478 --> 01:08:20.788
Meanwhile, sit back, relax,
and enjoy our afternoon...

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:28.078
Oh, hi, Chrissy. You're home early.
Aren't you on air tonight?

01:08:30.758 --> 01:08:32.750
Well, it would, uh, it would seem not.

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:40.432
Uh, we were gonna surprise you.
Making an apple pie. Your favorite.

01:08:40.558 --> 01:08:43.551
Um, this is Mitch,
my friend I was telling you about.

01:08:43.718 --> 01:08:45.357
Hi, honey. I'm Mitch.

01:08:45.478 --> 01:08:48.868
Um, y-your mom's told me
so much about you.

01:08:52.238 --> 01:08:55.948
Peg, can I talk to you
for a minute? Alone.

01:08:57.438 --> 01:09:00.749
- Nice to meet you, too, sweetheart!
- Mitch.

01:09:00.877 --> 01:09:03.073
Christine, we have company.

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:05.194
Now, please.

01:09:11.758 --> 01:09:13.158
What is going on with you?

01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:16.908
What is going on with me?
Where have you even been?

01:09:17.037 --> 01:09:19.872
Mitch surprised me.
We went to Key West. To a hotel.

01:09:19.997 --> 01:09:21.193
Are you kidding me?

01:09:21.318 --> 01:09:23.992
- What about work?
- Honey...

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.109
Here I am, just drowning under water,

01:09:26.238 --> 01:09:29.037
and you decide to take a romantic
getaway without telling anyone?

01:09:29.158 --> 01:09:31.548
- What are you, 15?
- What happened to you?

01:09:31.678 --> 01:09:34.988
What happened to me? How about
my mother abandoned me for four days,

01:09:35.118 --> 01:09:37.587
and now she shows up out of the blue
with some stranger

01:09:37.718 --> 01:09:40.711
that she's gonna have
sex with in my house?

01:09:40.837 --> 01:09:44.309
- Our house.
- Our house that I pay all the rent on,

01:09:44.438 --> 01:09:46.509
while she stays at home and smokes pot!

01:09:46.638 --> 01:09:50.791
- Christine, that is not fair.
- My life is a cesspool!

01:09:50.917 --> 01:09:54.753
I'm so, so sorry the smell
is inconvenient for you.

01:09:54.918 --> 01:09:57.831
It must be very, very nice
to have an escape hatch.

01:09:57.958 --> 01:10:01.998
Christine, you are scaring me.
It's getting to feel a lot like Boston.

01:10:02.118 --> 01:10:04.110
What is this?
Bring Up Boston month? I'm...

01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:06.756
I'm hurting. I'm in pain here.

01:10:06.878 --> 01:10:09.109
And it is... it is that simple.

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:10.831
Baby, I can see that.

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:14.110
What do you want me to do? Tell me
what to do. Look at me. I'm here!

01:10:15.198 --> 01:10:18.077
- But he's...
- Forget about him. Never mind him.

01:10:18.198 --> 01:10:20.190
Look at me. Look at Mom.

01:10:22.558 --> 01:10:26.598
You... You have these moods, baby.
You know you do.

01:10:26.718 --> 01:10:32.032
You put all this pressure on yourself,
and this is how it comes out.

01:10:32.158 --> 01:10:35.356
Can you see that? For a second.

01:10:35.478 --> 01:10:37.788
And I'm not always equipped
to deal with it.

01:10:38.638 --> 01:10:40.755
Maybe you should go back
to Dr. Benolken for a little.

01:10:40.918 --> 01:10:42.272
You liked him.

01:10:42.398 --> 01:10:44.708
That is a temporary solution.

01:10:44.838 --> 01:10:48.309
I need to fix my life.
My life is the problem.

01:10:49.758 --> 01:10:51.875
What? He's answering the phone now?

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:55.753
Uh, she's indisposed right now.
Can I take a message?

01:10:55.878 --> 01:10:58.632
Yes, could you tell her that Jean called?

01:10:58.758 --> 01:11:02.911
And that I... uh, wanted to talk to her.

01:11:03.038 --> 01:11:06.748
And that I'm her friend, and I'm sorry.

01:11:06.878 --> 01:11:09.438
- Alright.
- You know, I guess...

01:11:09.558 --> 01:11:11.868
Can you just ask her to call me back?

01:11:11.998 --> 01:11:13.512
OK.

01:11:13.638 --> 01:11:16.028
Why don't you just invite him
to move in with us, hm?

01:11:18.278 --> 01:11:20.713
Maybe I will. Maybe I'll move out.

01:11:21.838 --> 01:11:25.878
- Oh, the truth comes out!
- My God! You want me to act like this!

01:11:25.998 --> 01:11:28.593
I... I don't know
what to do with you sometimes!

01:11:28.758 --> 01:11:30.909
You want me to be your mom,
you want me to be your friend,

01:11:31.038 --> 01:11:32.472
you want me to be your punching bag!

01:11:32.638 --> 01:11:35.437
I am a person, too, Chris!
We're both adults here!

01:11:35.598 --> 01:11:41.390
I'm your child! You were supposed
to figure this all out.

01:11:41.518 --> 01:11:46.718
And maybe if you did, and spared me
for one day all your hippie baloney,

01:11:46.838 --> 01:11:51.515
I would actually understand
how the world works!

01:11:52.158 --> 01:11:53.831
Christine...

01:11:54.398 --> 01:11:58.711
I love you. Look, look,
let's just take some breaths.

01:11:58.838 --> 01:12:00.557
Why would you love me?

01:12:00.678 --> 01:12:03.432
It's weird that we live together.
Just say it.

01:12:03.558 --> 01:12:06.357
- I won't say that!
- We both know what's going on here.

01:12:06.478 --> 01:12:08.037
I got all turned around in Boston,

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:11.310
and I come here to relax and rehabilitate,

01:12:11.438 --> 01:12:12.872
and you're here to babysit me.

01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:16.548
- I won't say something that's not true.
- Well, it's not relaxing here, Peg!

01:12:16.678 --> 01:12:18.829
It's a trap here!

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:22.634
These people
are ruining me all over again!

01:12:22.758 --> 01:12:26.752
- These people...?
- Why won't anyone just listen to me?

01:13:13.078 --> 01:13:15.638
Hello, WZRB, This is Gail speaking.

01:13:16.478 --> 01:13:18.117
He's in a meeting right now.

01:13:29.798 --> 01:13:31.630
Hey, Chris. Did you get my message?

01:13:44.198 --> 01:13:45.518
Hi.

01:14:11.678 --> 01:14:14.477
WZRB, this is Gail speaking.
How may I direct your call?

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:21.114
Hey, Chris, I, um...

01:14:21.238 --> 01:14:22.752
Chubbuck.

01:14:22.878 --> 01:14:24.949
You got a minute
to pop into my office with me?

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:29.272
Did you wanna talk?

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:33.835
No, it's just, um...

01:14:33.958 --> 01:14:36.075
Mondays, you know.

01:14:36.398 --> 01:14:38.196
It's Thursday, Turner.

01:14:38.318 --> 01:14:40.594
- It's just a saying, George.
- Right.

01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:45.667
Have a seat.

01:14:52.998 --> 01:14:54.751
So, how are you?

01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:02.269
- I'm fine. You?
- You didn't seem fine yesterday.

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:04.833
Didn't you ever have a bad day?

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:08.156
Sure. I have bad days all the time.

01:15:10.758 --> 01:15:11.828
Listen...

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:17.029
Do you... Do you wanna
maybe get some dinner tonight?

01:15:23.878 --> 01:15:25.870
What do you mean?

01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:28.633
You know,
fork, knife, plate, food. Dinner.

01:15:32.318 --> 01:15:34.116
I don't... I don't get it.

01:15:35.358 --> 01:15:37.236
Chubbuck, I'm not gonna bite you.

01:15:41.998 --> 01:15:44.593
I feel like we're always about
to make some breakthrough

01:15:44.718 --> 01:15:46.630
to some new level of connectivity,

01:15:46.758 --> 01:15:49.353
but something gets in the way.

01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:55.518
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

01:15:56.038 --> 01:15:58.792
And then maybe afterwards,
I could take you somewhere.

01:16:00.198 --> 01:16:01.678
Somewhere where we could talk.

01:16:05.878 --> 01:16:07.676
Well, uh...

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:14.032
I'm gonna have to think about my schedule.

01:16:14.158 --> 01:16:16.309
Don't think. Just say what you wanna say.

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:18.270
It's a little more complicated than that.

01:16:18.398 --> 01:16:21.709
Why don't you just say... yes?

01:16:22.718 --> 01:16:27.235
And usually we can harvest
about 200, 300 eggs in a day.

01:16:27.358 --> 01:16:29.668
And they go straight out to market.

01:16:29.798 --> 01:16:31.676
Well, that's fascinating.

01:16:33.478 --> 01:16:36.152
Maybe you can get us some footage
of the chickens having sex,

01:16:36.318 --> 01:16:38.878
so people can see
how the eggs are really made.

01:16:41.558 --> 01:16:42.787
I'm kidding. That's a joke.

01:16:42.918 --> 01:16:47.151
We can edit it out later.

01:16:47.278 --> 01:16:51.033
I was gonna say, I've seen it.
It ain't pretty.

01:16:51.158 --> 01:16:53.389
Oh, well, I can only imagine.

01:17:27.478 --> 01:17:30.391
But before we get into those things,
I got to tell you the story

01:17:30.518 --> 01:17:32.510
told me by one of the cameraman
a few minutes ago.

01:17:32.638 --> 01:17:35.756
I thought it was a pretty hip story.
It's about this...

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:37.830
I'm, uh... I'm going out, Peg.

01:17:38.878 --> 01:17:40.358
Oh, you're talking to me now?

01:17:41.358 --> 01:17:43.509
How do I look?

01:17:46.998 --> 01:17:48.432
Really nice, actually.

01:17:50.398 --> 01:17:52.037
I have a date.

01:17:53.278 --> 01:17:54.553
You have a date?

01:17:57.478 --> 01:17:59.037
Guess who with.

01:17:59.718 --> 01:18:00.947
No!

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:03.876
No!

01:18:06.438 --> 01:18:08.191
Baby, I'm so happy for you.

01:18:08.318 --> 01:18:09.877
Yeah?

01:18:30.398 --> 01:18:31.593
Hi, George.

01:18:32.158 --> 01:18:34.229
Why, hello, Christine!

01:18:37.558 --> 01:18:38.833
Shall we?

01:18:45.798 --> 01:18:47.790
I thought you didn't drink.

01:18:49.518 --> 01:18:51.669
For the most part, I don't.

01:18:52.758 --> 01:18:56.513
Special occasions.
Uh, like Easter, or, um...

01:18:58.278 --> 01:19:01.589
I'm surprised that you,
uh, remembered that about me.

01:19:03.958 --> 01:19:05.915
I didn't drink for a really long time.

01:19:06.598 --> 01:19:08.829
Just easing back into it.

01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:12.029
Sometimes I still slip up and overdo it.

01:19:14.438 --> 01:19:16.589
If you'd told me a year ago
that I'd be sitting down

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:19.153
for a one-on-one dinner
with Christine Chubbuck,

01:19:19.278 --> 01:19:21.190
I would have told you you were crazy.

01:19:21.358 --> 01:19:23.031
Yeah, well, I-I would have, too.

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:26.515
I mean, I-I... I don't mean me,
I mean about you.

01:19:26.638 --> 01:19:27.708
Having dinner with you.

01:19:27.838 --> 01:19:31.195
- Right?
- I understood what you meant.

01:19:33.918 --> 01:19:36.387
So why haven't we been able
to just sit down

01:19:36.518 --> 01:19:38.510
and have a dinner like this together, huh?

01:19:38.638 --> 01:19:39.708
Well, I...

01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:43.077
I can shut people out,

01:19:43.198 --> 01:19:45.155
even when I don't mean to.

01:19:47.518 --> 01:19:48.998
I know how that feels, Christine.

01:19:50.678 --> 01:19:52.271
Believe me, I know how that feels.

01:20:51.078 --> 01:20:52.307
OK.

01:20:54.518 --> 01:20:55.747
Thank you.

01:20:56.798 --> 01:21:00.633
If you believe it will happen,
it will happen.

01:21:01.438 --> 01:21:02.474
Right.

01:21:03.278 --> 01:21:07.716
My mom always says stuff like, uh,
"Thoughts become things,"

01:21:07.878 --> 01:21:10.109
and mostly I just tune her out.

01:21:10.718 --> 01:21:14.632
But I really think that if I just
harness all the energy that I have,

01:21:14.758 --> 01:21:18.638
and put it into getting back
into a major market, then...

01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:22.153
I'm... I'm rambling.

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:24.270
Uh... I'm rambling.

01:21:27.158 --> 01:21:28.558
I'm sorry. I don't know.

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:32.074
I don't usually drink.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:36.271
This is very pretty. Where are we?

01:21:36.918 --> 01:21:38.637
This is where I went to high school.

01:21:40.278 --> 01:21:41.758
Really?

01:21:41.878 --> 01:21:45.315
Yeah, I'm a Florida boy. Never left home.

01:21:46.078 --> 01:21:47.353
Failure to launch.

01:21:47.478 --> 01:21:50.835
You can't be hard on yourself.

01:21:53.518 --> 01:21:55.828
I was an all-star quarterback here.

01:21:57.038 --> 01:21:59.314
Starter, three years.

01:22:00.198 --> 01:22:03.635
But then, I took a bad tackle in college
and messed up my shoulder,

01:22:03.758 --> 01:22:05.590
and I couldn't play anymore.

01:22:08.398 --> 01:22:11.869
After my injury,
I couldn't see the future.

01:22:11.998 --> 01:22:15.674
And I felt like a train off the rails.

01:22:16.358 --> 01:22:19.396
Not a lot of people know this,
but I got really into cocaine.

01:22:20.158 --> 01:22:21.558
It's bad stuff.

01:22:23.678 --> 01:22:25.715
It's the only way
I could feel alive anymore,

01:22:25.838 --> 01:22:28.273
because, in many ways, I was dead inside.

01:22:29.838 --> 01:22:31.830
But then one day,

01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:35.713
I met a man named Marvin Lammer
here in town.

01:22:35.838 --> 01:22:38.114
You ever heard that name before?

01:22:38.238 --> 01:22:40.116
No, no.

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:44.753
Well, Marvin saw what was going on
inside of me as plain as day.

01:22:47.518 --> 01:22:49.874
That my definitions were all wrong.

01:22:51.958 --> 01:22:54.996
See, I see the same thing
going on with you.

01:22:56.558 --> 01:22:58.277
The same thrashing around.

01:23:04.078 --> 01:23:05.478
What is this?

01:23:07.038 --> 01:23:09.314
We call it TA.

01:23:09.438 --> 01:23:12.397
It's short for transactional analysis.

01:23:12.518 --> 01:23:15.989
It's sort of like... group therapy.

01:23:18.198 --> 01:23:19.393
Don't be scared.

01:23:20.958 --> 01:23:22.358
Put your trust in me.

01:23:27.278 --> 01:23:29.668
How do, George? We're just about to start.

01:23:29.798 --> 01:23:34.270
Hey, everybody, this is my friend,
Christine, who I was telling you about.

01:23:34.878 --> 01:23:38.269
Everybody, please say hi
to George's friend, Christine.

01:23:38.398 --> 01:23:40.833
Hi, Christine!

01:23:40.958 --> 01:23:43.427
We're just about
to start a round of Yes, But.

01:23:43.558 --> 01:23:46.995
Um, Crystal, Jim, could y'all split up?

01:23:47.118 --> 01:23:48.916
Crystal, you work with Christine,

01:23:49.038 --> 01:23:51.348
and Jim, you can work with George.

01:23:51.478 --> 01:23:54.391
- Just give it a shot.
- OK.

01:23:54.518 --> 01:23:56.032
It's best just to dive right in.

01:23:56.158 --> 01:23:57.353
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:23:57.478 --> 01:24:00.710
Um.. maybe we'll set aside
some time later,

01:24:00.838 --> 01:24:03.228
so we'll talk a little bit
about the broader process.

01:24:03.358 --> 01:24:04.838
- Hm-hmm.
- OK.

01:24:11.398 --> 01:24:12.514
- Hi, Christine.
- Hi.

01:24:12.638 --> 01:24:14.197
- I'm Crystal.
- Hi.

01:24:17.918 --> 01:24:19.432
So...

01:24:25.638 --> 01:24:28.198
I know this can seem a little bit funny,

01:24:28.318 --> 01:24:30.787
but just try to relax
and let it wash over you, you know?

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:32.438
Uh-huh.

01:24:32.558 --> 01:24:35.198
We're gonna play
a little exercise called Yes, But.

01:24:35.318 --> 01:24:37.753
I'm gonna be Black,
and you're gonna be White, OK?

01:24:37.878 --> 01:24:41.269
Um, basically, you're just gonna tell me
a problem that you've been having,

01:24:41.398 --> 01:24:44.118
and I'm gonna try to come up
with a solution to that problem,

01:24:44.238 --> 01:24:47.515
and then you'll counter that
by saying, "Yes, but..."

01:24:47.638 --> 01:24:49.709
For instance, "I need to lose weight."

01:24:49.838 --> 01:24:52.478
I would say, "Why don't you join
an aerobics class?"

01:24:52.598 --> 01:24:54.157
And you would say something like,

01:24:54.278 --> 01:24:57.476
"Yes, but I can't afford
the membership fee," et cetera.

01:24:57.598 --> 01:24:59.157
- Hmm.
- Got it?

01:25:00.558 --> 01:25:05.428
And... this is, this is gonna
help... help me?

01:25:05.998 --> 01:25:10.470
- Yes, in a way. In time. You'll see.
- Hmm.

01:25:11.798 --> 01:25:13.391
Would you like to give it a shot?

01:25:15.758 --> 01:25:17.033
Sure.

01:25:20.718 --> 01:25:22.311
Whenever you're ready.

01:25:26.358 --> 01:25:31.638
Uh, well... I-I really wish
that I could get a job promotion.

01:25:32.678 --> 01:25:34.112
Why don't you ask for one?

01:25:35.758 --> 01:25:38.353
- I already have.
- Um, yes, but...

01:25:42.718 --> 01:25:45.392
Yes, but I already have.

01:25:45.518 --> 01:25:48.317
They say I have to do different work.

01:25:48.438 --> 01:25:50.157
Then why don't you do different work?

01:25:51.478 --> 01:25:53.470
Yes, but if I do different work,

01:25:53.598 --> 01:25:56.067
then I won't be doing the work
that I love.

01:25:56.758 --> 01:25:58.351
Why don't you try a compromise?

01:25:59.118 --> 01:26:00.871
Well, that just makes my stomach hurt.

01:26:02.278 --> 01:26:03.951
Um... Yes, but...

01:26:04.078 --> 01:26:08.038
Hm, yes, but that just
makes my stomach hurt.

01:26:08.878 --> 01:26:10.597
Why don't you see a doctor?

01:26:11.518 --> 01:26:13.396
Yes, but I have.

01:26:13.558 --> 01:26:16.153
He tells me I have to have an operation.

01:26:16.598 --> 01:26:18.396
Well, why don't you have the operation?

01:26:20.398 --> 01:26:22.913
Yes, but if I have the operation, then...

01:26:24.358 --> 01:26:26.429
I won't be able to have children.

01:26:26.558 --> 01:26:28.629
Well, why don't you have a baby, then?

01:26:29.598 --> 01:26:31.237
Yes, but I...

01:26:31.998 --> 01:26:35.514
I haven't gotten the man I love
to fall in love with me yet.

01:26:36.438 --> 01:26:39.078
Why don't you have a different man
impregnate you?

01:26:39.198 --> 01:26:41.508
Yes, but I can't have sex
with just anyone.

01:26:41.638 --> 01:26:45.075
I-I-I haven't had sex at all.
I'm a virgin.

01:26:45.198 --> 01:26:46.518
Oh.

01:26:46.678 --> 01:26:47.953
Um...

01:26:49.158 --> 01:26:50.831
Why don't you try to adopt a baby?

01:26:53.398 --> 01:26:58.473
Yes, but I've always
wanted to have a baby.

01:26:58.598 --> 01:27:00.715
And I've always wanted to have a husband,

01:27:00.838 --> 01:27:04.070
and I've always wanted to have a job

01:27:04.238 --> 01:27:06.434
where I can do the work that I wanna do.

01:27:07.398 --> 01:27:09.674
Why don't you manage your expectations?

01:27:09.798 --> 01:27:12.188
Maybe, um, adjust your thinking?

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:18.912
I don't... I don't, um...

01:27:19.558 --> 01:27:21.277
I don't understand the question.

01:27:23.918 --> 01:27:26.956
Christine, it works.

01:27:27.078 --> 01:27:29.877
I promise you.

01:27:32.798 --> 01:27:34.994
Once you learn your life script...

01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:39.195
it really just becomes OK.

01:27:46.238 --> 01:27:49.231
Can I tell you something?
I'm gonna tell you something.

01:27:50.558 --> 01:27:52.117
I want you to hear it from me first.

01:27:52.238 --> 01:27:54.958
I've known for a couple days,
but I haven't told anybody yet.

01:27:57.278 --> 01:27:58.758
I'm going to Baltimore.

01:27:59.918 --> 01:28:01.432
To anchor.

01:28:01.558 --> 01:28:04.118
For Bob Andersen's new station.

01:28:08.398 --> 01:28:10.230
Wh... What?

01:28:12.158 --> 01:28:13.512
How?

01:28:14.358 --> 01:28:17.192
I don't know, Bob Andersen came up to me
at the 4th of July party,

01:28:17.318 --> 01:28:21.676
and told me I had
a steady, paternal presence.

01:28:21.798 --> 01:28:24.552
Then just like that,
bam, I'm going to Baltimore.

01:28:25.358 --> 01:28:26.758
Just like that.

01:28:26.878 --> 01:28:30.235
I know you were jockeying
for a spot up there, but...

01:28:31.558 --> 01:28:34.278
This just goes to show
if a dumb quarterback like me

01:28:34.398 --> 01:28:37.038
can get where he wants to go, so can you.

01:28:39.078 --> 01:28:40.592
Believe me, Christine.

01:28:40.718 --> 01:28:42.949
You have so much passion and integrity,

01:28:43.078 --> 01:28:45.673
you're bound for even greater things.

01:28:45.838 --> 01:28:48.990
Chicago. Hell, New York City!

01:28:50.718 --> 01:28:52.232
I believe that.

01:28:56.878 --> 01:28:59.393
I really hope you can
still help me with my copy.

01:29:00.198 --> 01:29:01.837
Maybe we can do phone calls.

01:29:05.118 --> 01:29:06.950
Phone calls sound good.

01:29:07.558 --> 01:29:08.787
Good.

01:29:11.358 --> 01:29:12.474
OK.

01:29:13.678 --> 01:29:14.668
I'll see you at work.

01:29:14.798 --> 01:29:16.596
Yes, I will see you at work. Goodnight.

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:20.038
OK. Oh, and thank you. For dinner.

01:29:49.478 --> 01:29:52.835
- Can I help you?
- Hi... Forgive me.

01:29:52.958 --> 01:29:58.477
I-I-I've blown a flat tire
outside of your house, and, uh...

01:30:00.158 --> 01:30:01.638
Mr. Andersen?

01:30:02.478 --> 01:30:07.155
Uh... Is this? I-I-I didn't realize
this was your house.

01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:09.156
I'm sorry. Do I...?

01:30:10.478 --> 01:30:12.947
It's me. I'm Christine Chubbuck.

01:30:13.078 --> 01:30:15.035
I'm a field reporter at WZRB.

01:30:15.158 --> 01:30:18.754
Oh! Oh, hi!
I... I thought I recognized you.

01:30:18.878 --> 01:30:20.551
Would you like to come in...

01:30:20.678 --> 01:30:22.670
- Yes.
- ...for a minute and use the phone?

01:30:22.798 --> 01:30:24.915
Thank you. That'd... That'd be very nice.

01:30:29.918 --> 01:30:33.832
Now I was just having
a little midnight snack.

01:30:34.878 --> 01:30:40.749
Oh. Uh, excuse the mess.
I haven't had a chance to clean up.

01:30:42.838 --> 01:30:45.273
Uh, you wanna use the phone?

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:50.348
Uh, I-I might need
just to take a... second here.

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:53.471
That's... I'm a little shaken up.

01:30:53.598 --> 01:30:56.591
Sure, sure.

01:31:06.758 --> 01:31:08.989
Did you happen to get to catch
any of our reporting

01:31:09.118 --> 01:31:10.916
while you were here
the last couple of weeks?

01:31:11.038 --> 01:31:13.428
Not as much as I would've liked.

01:31:13.558 --> 01:31:15.675
No, I was mostly tied up

01:31:15.798 --> 01:31:19.633
with construction
on the other properties I own down here.

01:31:19.758 --> 01:31:24.708
Well, I always try to do
informational pieces, community affairs.

01:31:24.838 --> 01:31:26.067
Uh...

01:31:26.758 --> 01:31:29.227
I should, uh, show you a clip sometime.

01:31:30.038 --> 01:31:33.156
Hmm. Have Michael send me a tape.

01:31:35.318 --> 01:31:37.196
You know our anchor, George Ryan?

01:31:38.838 --> 01:31:41.990
Well, yes. He's... He's the anchor.

01:31:42.118 --> 01:31:45.077
Well, he and I have a terrific chemistry.

01:31:45.198 --> 01:31:48.509
I think I should try and find a piece
where we're at the desk together.

01:31:48.638 --> 01:31:50.755
You'll know what I'm talking about.

01:31:50.878 --> 01:31:53.188
Well, sounds fantastic.

01:31:57.078 --> 01:32:00.708
You see that there? The anchor,
he shuffled his papers there?

01:32:00.838 --> 01:32:02.989
That seems like a tic, but...

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:07.511
actually he's added that
consciously to his delivery.

01:32:08.558 --> 01:32:11.471
I think it makes people
feel more comfortable.

01:32:12.278 --> 01:32:15.794
George and I,
we have that same attention to detail.

01:32:16.758 --> 01:32:19.114
I guess I never saw that before.

01:32:19.878 --> 01:32:25.590
I mostly just keep this on for company.

01:32:29.318 --> 01:32:33.392
I feel like you were maybe leading up
to a question there.

01:32:33.518 --> 01:32:36.716
Did I miss it? Uh, I've had a few.

01:32:42.038 --> 01:32:44.553
I'm going to cut to the chase,
Mr. Andersen.

01:32:45.878 --> 01:32:48.154
I'm not supposed to know, but I have heard

01:32:48.998 --> 01:32:52.196
that George has been promoted
and is going to Baltimore.

01:32:54.078 --> 01:32:55.478
And I want to know...

01:32:56.478 --> 01:32:58.993
if you're still looking
for another news person.

01:33:00.078 --> 01:33:04.755
If the qualities that I have mentioned
are important to you.

01:33:08.278 --> 01:33:12.272
Oh, well... We've already hired our quota.

01:33:12.438 --> 01:33:17.911
That... That little blonde number
in Sports...

01:33:18.038 --> 01:33:20.758
Uh, um... Oh.

01:33:21.358 --> 01:33:22.678
Hm.

01:33:23.638 --> 01:33:25.231
- Andrea?
- Uh, yeah.

01:33:25.358 --> 01:33:28.192
Andrea. Firecracker.

01:33:32.678 --> 01:33:34.670
She's going to Baltimore?

01:33:36.358 --> 01:33:38.873
Oh, well, George suggested
that they go together,

01:33:38.998 --> 01:33:43.948
and I said, "Well, sounds like fun.
What the hell!"

01:33:52.278 --> 01:33:54.554
Uh, but the door is always open.

01:33:54.678 --> 01:33:57.193
I always leave the door open as policy.

01:33:57.918 --> 01:34:02.151
I just try not to overthink
these things too much, you know?

01:34:03.118 --> 01:34:07.874
My wife likes to read the papers,
watch the news.

01:34:08.798 --> 01:34:12.633
Uh, she and I took a vacation
down here once.

01:34:12.758 --> 01:34:14.511
She liked it.

01:34:14.638 --> 01:34:16.197
Bam!

01:34:16.318 --> 01:34:18.389
I bought the news station.

01:34:18.518 --> 01:34:20.749
Bam! I bought this house.

01:34:21.518 --> 01:34:23.191
See what I'm saying?

01:34:25.358 --> 01:34:28.715
- Follow your gut.
- Exactly.

01:34:28.838 --> 01:34:31.672
And leave the managing to the managers.

01:34:31.798 --> 01:34:37.112
Life is hard enough
without dwelling on every little thing.

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:40.709
And... man, is it hard.

01:34:41.678 --> 01:34:44.876
And that's... the liquor talking.

01:34:47.518 --> 01:34:49.669
Which is another problem I have.

01:34:50.478 --> 01:34:52.913
But there's only one way out.

01:34:53.998 --> 01:34:55.034
Forward.

01:35:19.438 --> 01:35:21.316
Hon?

01:35:21.438 --> 01:35:22.588
Honey?

01:35:24.838 --> 01:35:26.113
Hi, Peg.

01:35:26.598 --> 01:35:29.636
Baby, your alarm's
been going off for an hour.

01:35:29.758 --> 01:35:32.478
I don't think
I've ever seen you oversleep.

01:35:32.598 --> 01:35:34.032
Was it a late night?

01:35:35.838 --> 01:35:37.113
Oh.

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:39.273
Yes.

01:35:40.318 --> 01:35:42.150
Well, great!

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:44.156
See, you were just lonely, right?

01:35:44.278 --> 01:35:45.837
Bet you feel better already.

01:35:45.958 --> 01:35:49.110
You always come through these funks.

01:35:50.118 --> 01:35:51.950
Move in circles.

01:35:52.638 --> 01:35:56.393
By the way, I made a reservation
at Davenport's for your birthday.

01:35:56.558 --> 01:35:59.118
No pressure. We can always cancel.

01:36:04.638 --> 01:36:06.470
Miss Tangerine?

01:36:08.478 --> 01:36:10.435
Miss Tangerine?

01:36:11.358 --> 01:36:14.271
You're not saying anything,
Miss Tangerine.

01:36:17.158 --> 01:36:19.514
Well, what would you like me to say?

01:36:21.118 --> 01:36:22.996
I don't know.

01:36:23.118 --> 01:36:25.110
I like it when you talk to me.

01:36:28.238 --> 01:36:32.118
Well, what if I don't have
anything else to say?

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:38.157
You mean it's... it's OK
to be quiet sometimes?

01:36:40.438 --> 01:36:43.988
Yes, See Saw, sometimes it is.

01:36:46.838 --> 01:36:49.307
Can I be quiet with you?

01:36:52.438 --> 01:36:56.557
Yes. See Saw, you can be quiet with me.

01:37:09.118 --> 01:37:12.748
- Morning, Jean.
- Hey. Good morning, Chris.

01:37:12.878 --> 01:37:14.107
Frank.

01:37:20.278 --> 01:37:21.792
George.

01:37:24.598 --> 01:37:26.476
George Ryan.

01:37:26.598 --> 01:37:29.670
Chris, can you get this VO done by noon?

01:37:29.798 --> 01:37:33.155
- Oh, the children's hospital called.
- OK. Sure.

01:37:33.278 --> 01:37:34.792
Using it when...

01:37:34.918 --> 01:37:36.113
Come in.

01:37:36.878 --> 01:37:39.347
Hi, Mike. Uh, do you have a second?

01:37:40.038 --> 01:37:41.074
Chubbuck.

01:37:43.598 --> 01:37:46.193
- Can we have a talk?
- Hey, I can go.

01:37:47.158 --> 01:37:50.196
No, no. Stay, actually. I...

01:37:51.598 --> 01:37:53.749
I would rather you stayed.

01:37:53.878 --> 01:37:56.074
Uh, so, two things first.

01:37:56.198 --> 01:38:01.796
I... I got the scratch VO for that piece
about the campsite from yesterday.

01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:04.194
We're kicking the can on that.

01:38:04.318 --> 01:38:07.675
I have to run this fucking story
about the bowling alley going under.

01:38:07.798 --> 01:38:11.109
OK. Sure. You just... You just tell me.

01:38:12.278 --> 01:38:13.871
I will.

01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:18.509
Uh, second thing is, um...

01:38:19.758 --> 01:38:21.715
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:27.111
I wanna ask your permission
to lead a story from the desk.

01:38:27.238 --> 01:38:28.718
You are not leading.

01:38:28.878 --> 01:38:31.074
- Mike...
- You know what?

01:38:31.998 --> 01:38:33.751
Don't. He's right.

01:38:35.318 --> 01:38:40.598
You're right. I know.
I have been a... real bear lately.

01:38:47.398 --> 01:38:48.832
I can see that now.

01:38:51.398 --> 01:38:52.514
Look, Mike.

01:38:53.558 --> 01:38:56.710
I know we're in a less-than-ideal
situation here together.

01:38:58.238 --> 01:38:59.877
You're not going anywhere.

01:39:01.678 --> 01:39:03.351
And I'm not going anywhere.

01:39:05.638 --> 01:39:09.473
So I would like to wipe the slate clean.
I'll read anything you like.

01:39:09.598 --> 01:39:12.557
What is this? What are you doing?

01:39:12.678 --> 01:39:14.590
I've been thinking a lot about

01:39:15.318 --> 01:39:19.437
your idea of, um...
sensationalizing the news.

01:39:19.598 --> 01:39:22.591
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Mike, listen.

01:39:24.078 --> 01:39:25.876
I'm agreeing with you.

01:39:29.758 --> 01:39:32.671
I just got sidetracked for a second there.

01:39:32.798 --> 01:39:36.838
I should've fired your ass
for your tantrum the other day.

01:39:37.398 --> 01:39:39.469
You should have, but you didn't.

01:39:42.678 --> 01:39:45.238
If I mess this up,
I'll never ask for anything again.

01:39:46.038 --> 01:39:47.358
Cross my heart.

01:39:47.478 --> 01:39:49.151
I mean, Mike, come on.

01:39:51.078 --> 01:39:52.592
Mike.

01:39:53.478 --> 01:39:55.390
I don't know.

01:39:57.998 --> 01:40:01.070
No one's watching us anyway, remember?

01:40:01.198 --> 01:40:02.234
Ha.

01:40:06.038 --> 01:40:10.555
You can report whatever comes in
over the weekend. Whatever I say.

01:40:12.878 --> 01:40:14.153
Thank you.

01:40:15.358 --> 01:40:16.474
I mean...

01:40:19.798 --> 01:40:21.755
You say please. It's nice.

01:40:23.278 --> 01:40:24.951
"Please" I can work with.

01:41:46.718 --> 01:41:48.516
We're not trying to prove psychic powers,

01:41:48.638 --> 01:41:50.595
but let's see if you can pick up the image

01:41:50.718 --> 01:41:52.949
which I'll tell you
at the end of the program.

01:41:53.078 --> 01:41:56.230
Alright? Ready now? Begin.

01:41:57.038 --> 01:41:58.233
Concentrate.

01:41:59.238 --> 01:42:05.109
- Oh, hi, Chrissy.
- As you were. As you were.

01:42:06.278 --> 01:42:11.398
The name which I can see...
on a sheet of paper...

01:42:13.278 --> 01:42:14.678
She seems better.

01:42:16.118 --> 01:42:17.916
She does, doesn't she?

01:42:18.038 --> 01:42:20.314
With your eyes closed, of course.

01:42:20.438 --> 01:42:22.077
She's my favorite person.

01:42:24.758 --> 01:42:27.034
You're my favorite person.

01:42:27.198 --> 01:42:29.349
- Get over yourself.
- Hubba hubba!

01:42:35.918 --> 01:42:39.548
- That's great.
- OK. Good.

01:42:39.678 --> 01:42:41.158
Let's keep it simple.

01:42:41.278 --> 01:42:42.997
Let's use five or ten seconds at the top.

01:42:43.118 --> 01:42:45.678
- OK, are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:42:45.798 --> 01:42:47.357
Can you, uh...?

01:42:47.478 --> 01:42:50.198
Can you make sure that Darren
is recording the show tonight?

01:42:50.318 --> 01:42:53.390
I'll want it for my reels.
I will go out of pocket for it.

01:42:53.558 --> 01:42:54.548
Alright.

01:43:08.398 --> 01:43:10.833
Hey, Chris. Do you wanna go to lunch?

01:43:10.958 --> 01:43:12.278
Uh...

01:43:14.038 --> 01:43:17.395
- Maybe tomorrow.
- OK. Rain check.

01:43:59.358 --> 01:44:01.475
OK, everyone, we're getting close.

01:44:01.598 --> 01:44:03.112
Let's get ready.

01:44:29.038 --> 01:44:30.597
Chubbuck's big night.

01:44:37.798 --> 01:44:42.554
This is News Watch at Five
with your anchor, George Ryan,

01:44:42.678 --> 01:44:45.193
Steve Turner, weather, Andrea Kirby...

01:44:45.318 --> 01:44:50.598
OK, everyone,
We're going live in five, four...

01:44:51.358 --> 01:44:52.394
three...

01:44:52.518 --> 01:44:56.831
It is Monday, July 15th,
and this is your News Watch at Five.

01:44:56.958 --> 01:44:59.996
Good evening, Sarasota. I'm George Ryan.

01:45:00.118 --> 01:45:03.111
To begin our broadcast tonight,
we turn to Christine Chubbuck...

01:45:03.238 --> 01:45:04.274
Camera two.

01:45:04.438 --> 01:45:07.590
...with a report on some upsetting
events that occurred over the weekend.

01:45:07.718 --> 01:45:09.118
- Christine.
- Take two.

01:45:09.278 --> 01:45:10.871
Thank you, George.

01:45:12.078 --> 01:45:15.469
An 18-year-old man named James Whitworth
was stabbed this weekend

01:45:15.598 --> 01:45:18.875
in the parking lot
of the Starwood Tavern on 27th Street.

01:45:19.038 --> 01:45:22.998
The event occurred
at roughly 4:30pm on Sunday.

01:45:23.638 --> 01:45:26.995
It is unclear how the altercation
that led to the stabbing began

01:45:27.118 --> 01:45:30.270
with conflicting reports
citing a financial disagreement

01:45:30.398 --> 01:45:32.196
and an argument over a relationship.

01:45:32.318 --> 01:45:34.037
Ready, projector one?

01:45:34.158 --> 01:45:36.798
Telecine's down. One is not gonna run.

01:45:36.918 --> 01:45:39.672
What? No! No, go fix it.

01:45:39.798 --> 01:45:41.027
Go fix it, Kenny! Goddamn it!

01:45:41.158 --> 01:45:43.798
...an assailant whose name
has not been released...

01:45:43.918 --> 01:45:46.990
Tell him, uh, uh, uh...
Flag anything that needs film.

01:45:47.118 --> 01:45:49.678
And we'll, uh, bump up anything
that's on the quad.

01:45:51.558 --> 01:45:55.154
We go now to exclusive footage
of the crime scene just moments after...

01:45:55.278 --> 01:45:58.749
- What do I do?
- Tell George, goddamn it.

01:45:58.878 --> 01:46:01.109
It's jammed. It isn't going to roll.

01:46:02.238 --> 01:46:03.797
It isn't going to roll.

01:46:09.998 --> 01:46:11.637
Here we go. Come on, Kenny!

01:46:11.798 --> 01:46:16.714
Uh, it appears that we're having
some technical difficulty.

01:46:18.158 --> 01:46:20.115
We had wanted to show you
some film from the scene,

01:46:20.238 --> 01:46:21.513
but I'm sure that if you...

01:46:21.638 --> 01:46:23.516
Kenny, where are we with the projector?

01:46:23.638 --> 01:46:24.958
No...

01:46:26.118 --> 01:46:27.188
So...

01:46:29.078 --> 01:46:30.432
Now...

01:46:30.558 --> 01:46:32.515
In keeping with the WZRB policy...

01:46:32.638 --> 01:46:35.312
- Don't give up on it.
- ...of presenting the most immediate

01:46:35.438 --> 01:46:39.717
and complete reports
of local blood and guts,

01:46:39.838 --> 01:46:46.153
TV 30 presents what is believed
to be a television first.

01:46:47.878 --> 01:46:49.597
In living color,

01:46:49.718 --> 01:46:55.237
an exclusive coverage
of an attempted suicide.

01:47:04.038 --> 01:47:05.597
Go to black. Go to black.

01:47:10.078 --> 01:47:11.671
Very funny, Christine.

01:47:12.198 --> 01:47:13.393
Oh, my God!

01:47:13.518 --> 01:47:15.987
Oh, my God! Somebody call an ambulance!

01:47:16.118 --> 01:47:17.757
Grab a towel! Grab anything!

01:47:17.878 --> 01:47:19.392
Gail! Get on the phone!

01:47:19.518 --> 01:47:21.396
Get on the phone right now!

01:47:29.478 --> 01:47:31.390
- I need you to try to calm down.
- OK.

01:47:31.518 --> 01:47:35.717
I know you're scared. You gotta
stay calm. She needs you to be calm.

01:47:36.398 --> 01:47:41.314
Christine. Christine.

01:47:41.438 --> 01:47:44.715
Sir, I'm gonna need you to put that down.
That's evidence.

01:47:46.558 --> 01:47:48.914
Sir, I'm sorry.
This is an active crime scene.

01:47:49.038 --> 01:47:50.552
You're gonna have to put that down.

01:47:55.918 --> 01:47:57.989
Respiration is shallow.

01:48:00.118 --> 01:48:01.791
Bring it in, bring it in.

01:48:10.958 --> 01:48:14.713
- There must be someone with...
- I'm sorry. No.

01:48:14.878 --> 01:48:16.232
Mrs. Chubbuck?

01:48:16.358 --> 01:48:18.236
- Yes.
- I'm Jean.

01:48:18.838 --> 01:48:20.716
You're Jean, from the station?

01:48:20.838 --> 01:48:22.067
Yeah.

01:48:24.318 --> 01:48:25.752
I'm so sorry.

01:48:27.878 --> 01:48:31.508
- How's she doing? What's going on?
- I'm really sorry.

01:48:31.638 --> 01:48:34.358
- I know. I...
- Oh, my God!

01:48:35.038 --> 01:48:36.472
I'm really sorry.

01:48:36.598 --> 01:48:41.275
I'm OK. You're OK. I'm OK. You're OK.

01:48:41.398 --> 01:48:44.835
Repeat it. Say it.
Say it, say it! I'm OK...

01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:48.235
...and shot herself in the head
while the program was on the air.

01:48:48.358 --> 01:48:51.635
30-year-old Chris Chubbuck,
is in critical condition tonight.

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:55.832
Seconds before shooting herself,
Miss Chubbuck told TV viewers,

01:48:55.958 --> 01:49:00.350
"In keeping with Channel 30's policy
of bringing you the latest in bloody..."

01:49:00.478 --> 01:49:04.950
TV 30 presents what is believed
to be a television first.

01:49:06.478 --> 01:49:08.549
In living color,

01:49:08.678 --> 01:49:12.274
an exclusive coverage
of an attempted suicide.

01:49:41.078 --> 01:49:44.196
The woman host of a television
talk show in Sarasota, Florida,

01:49:44.318 --> 01:49:47.152
Chris Chubbuck, today read a news item
about a local shooting,

01:49:47.278 --> 01:49:50.157
then told her viewers they were
about to see a television first.

01:49:50.838 --> 01:49:54.593
She pulled a gun from a shopping bag
and shot herself in the head.

01:49:54.718 --> 01:49:57.597
She's in critical condition
at a Sarasota hospital.

01:49:57.718 --> 01:50:00.313
In other news tonight,
Vice President Ford said today

01:50:00.438 --> 01:50:02.475
that Watergate has this country deadlocked

01:50:02.598 --> 01:50:04.191
on its major domestic problems,

01:50:04.318 --> 01:50:06.992
and that something must be done
to break this impasse.

01:50:07.558 --> 01:50:09.834
In California, the vice president said...

01:50:58.398 --> 01:51:02.187
Scratch VO
for Christine Chubbuck memorial.

01:51:04.118 --> 01:51:06.394
Uh, Christine Chubbuck was born August...

01:51:08.358 --> 01:51:11.829
August 24, 1944.

01:51:11.958 --> 01:51:13.278
Uh...

01:51:19.438 --> 01:51:20.872
OK...

01:51:25.758 --> 01:51:27.909
My name is Christine Chubbuck,

01:51:28.038 --> 01:51:29.791
and I'm a field reporter at WZRB.

01:51:29.918 --> 01:51:32.877
Mrs. Cazacracker do you call her?

01:51:33.038 --> 01:51:34.028
You know. Come on.

01:51:34.158 --> 01:51:36.912
Uh, chickens are a very serious...

01:51:37.038 --> 01:51:39.030
An entire community imperiled.

01:51:40.358 --> 01:51:42.270
It begs the question,

01:51:42.398 --> 01:51:46.631
is it paranoia if everyone
is indeed coming after you?

01:51:48.238 --> 01:51:50.275
You can just drop it on the floor for now.

01:51:50.398 --> 01:51:53.232
Hey, Christine.
Are we interrupting something?

01:51:53.358 --> 01:51:56.635
No. I was just running
some tape on myself.

01:51:57.318 --> 01:51:59.230
Oh, it's a new quad machine. Sorry.

01:51:59.398 --> 01:52:00.593
- Hey, Jean?
- Yeah?

01:52:00.718 --> 01:52:03.790
Have you, uh, noticed
that I do this thing when I...

01:52:03.918 --> 01:52:06.990
I nod a little too sympathetically
when I'm interviewing a subject?

01:52:07.118 --> 01:52:09.349
No. How can you be too sympathetic?

01:52:12.918 --> 01:52:14.830
Hey, Pepper. Hey, sweetie.

01:52:14.958 --> 01:52:17.029
Pss, pss, pss, pss.

01:52:21.518 --> 01:52:22.747
Good evening.

01:52:22.918 --> 01:52:25.956
President Ford told
a congressional subcommittee today

01:52:26.078 --> 01:52:30.550
that there was no deal, period,
involved in the pardon of Richard Nixon.

01:52:30.718 --> 01:52:32.869
Mr. Ford's appearance
before a subcommittee

01:52:32.998 --> 01:52:36.514
of the House Judiciary Committee
has no precedent in history.

01:52:36.638 --> 01:52:39.870
He is the first president ever
to testify voluntarily

01:52:39.998 --> 01:52:43.196
before the House of Representatives.
And the message he brought

01:52:43.358 --> 01:52:46.874
was that his swift
and unexpected pardon of Mr. Nixon

01:52:46.998 --> 01:52:50.309
was done only because resignation
and punishment was enough,

01:52:50.438 --> 01:52:53.954
and because the country had to focus
on other problems facing it.

01:52:54.118 --> 01:52:56.508
Here are some of the main points
the president made

01:52:56.638 --> 01:52:58.436
in a two-hour session.

01:52:59.198 --> 01:53:03.158
Our nation is under the severest
of challenges now

01:53:03.278 --> 01:53:06.476
to employ its full energy and efforts

01:53:06.598 --> 01:53:09.636
in the pursuit
of a sound and growing economy.

01:53:09.798 --> 01:53:12.358
We would needlessly be diverted

01:53:12.478 --> 01:53:14.629
from meeting those challenges

01:53:14.758 --> 01:53:17.353
if we as a people were to...

01:53:17.518 --> 01:53:22.115
...and treats its opponents
as enemies must never, never be...

01:53:41.518 --> 01:53:44.033
# This world is awfully big

01:53:44.158 --> 01:53:47.356
# Girl, this time you're on your own

01:53:47.478 --> 01:53:51.233
# Well, it's time you started livin'

01:53:51.358 --> 01:53:55.068
# It's time you let someone else
do some giving

01:53:55.198 --> 01:53:58.874
# Love is all around No need to waste it

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:03.038
# You can have a town
Why don't you take it?

01:54:03.158 --> 01:54:08.108
# You might just make it after all

01:54:10.478 --> 01:54:14.870
# You might just make it after all

01:54:20.558 --> 01:54:23.596
This show was taped
in front of a live studio audience.

01:54:26.798 --> 01:54:28.596
Good morning, everyone...
