No, there's a cop out fro.

I'm fine.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.153
All right, one dollar.

01:13.374 --> 01:16.008
Hmm.
Not familiar with the brand.

01:16.010 --> 01:17.042
Can's rather small,

01:17.044 --> 01:20.145
with a dated design
and no nutritional info.

01:20.147 --> 01:23.182

This one is known
as the Rough Rider

01:53.981 --> 01:55.747
Yeah, I know what
that is, Junior.

01:58.418 --> 02:01.253
You got almost
every single merit badge.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.956
Yep, I'm going to be the
youngest Chief Scout in history.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.358
Only five more
badges to go.

Welcome, Scouts,
to our big trip kickoff!

05:18.919 --> 05:20.485
Hoo!

05:20.487 --> 05:24.089
And by "Scouts," I mean
Freedom Scouts, not Boy Scouts;

05:24.091 --> 05:27.326
a legally distinct and
entirely separate organization

05:27.328 --> 05:30.195
with whom we are often confused,
and who are having their own

05:30.197 --> 05:31.830
trip kickoff meeting right now

05:31.832 --> 05:33.932

Get on the bus.

Ew. No. Next.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.943
Get on the bus.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.347
Up next, to give you families
a little information

05:48.349 --> 05:51.083
about our trip
is Cleveland Brown Jr.,

05:51.085 --> 05:54.119
who recently earned
his merit badge in PowerPoint.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.354
(crowd applauds)

05:55.356 --> 05:57.989
Oh, I love PowerPoint
presentations.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.925
Hope he has some
cool transitions.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.827
Come on, checker wipe!

06:01.829 --> 06:03.595
You know, I actually
helped Junior

06:03.597 --> 06:05.030
with his presentation.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.466
He just doesn't know it yet.

06:07.468 --> 06:11.036
Our voyage will begin
on State Route 319

06:11.038 --> 06:13.004
as we head west
past the drag strip

06:13.006 --> 06:14.539
and turn right at Arby's.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.941
(PowerPoint swoosh)
CLEVELAND:
There it is!

06:15.943 --> 06:19.878
Just a half mile down the road,
we'll reach the campground.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.147
Now, here's where
it gets interesting.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.482
(crowd gasps)

06:23.484 --> 06:25.083
Scenic, isn't it?

06:25.085 --> 06:29.020
A never-ending wonderland
of natural delights.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.455
(crowd laughs)

06:30.457 --> 06:34.025
Just look at that vast expanse
of virgin territory,

06:34.027 --> 06:37.829
the dense, bushy thicket,
where, if you look close enough,

06:37.831 --> 06:40.499
you can see
my penis and testicles.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.701
My penis and testicles?!

06:42.703 --> 06:43.835
Boner alert!

06:43.837 --> 06:46.138
That boner-- or mistake--

06:46.140 --> 06:49.141
was me allowing you
to make this presentation.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.409
It's over!

06:52.545 --> 06:54.546
But Scoutmaster
and Principal Farquhar,

06:54.548 --> 06:56.081
it wasn't my fault!

06:56.083 --> 06:57.182
It's true, Wally.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.984
Junior was Rallo'ed.

06:58.986 --> 07:02.254
I don't understand
jive, but regardless,

07:02.256 --> 07:05.123
that type of nudism
is unacceptable.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.093
Sorry, Junior, but you're
out of the Scouts.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.830
(tires screech)

07:14.434 --> 07:16.368
Given the gravity
of the situation,

07:16.370 --> 07:17.803
it seems
inappropriate

07:17.805 --> 07:20.338
to do or say
something funny right now.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.908
I agree.
Let's just play this straight.

07:26.379 --> 07:30.081
Must be easy to be in one
of those drama shows.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.349
Mr. Brown?

07:31.351 --> 07:32.417
I have your...

07:32.419 --> 07:33.952
test results.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.657
I have...

07:38.659 --> 07:40.926
fart cancer.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.994
(all laughing)

07:46.098 --> 07:48.433
Oh, we can't
turn it off, folks.

07:48.435 --> 07:49.768
We'll be right back.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.174
You've gone
too far, Rallo.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.810
You got your brother kicked
out of the stupid Scouts.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.112
Which he loves because he
doesn't know any better.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.249
All I needed was rock climbing
and whitewater rafting.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.985
Then I'd have been
a full-fledged Chief Scout.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.687
(sobbing)

08:08.689 --> 08:11.323
Rallo, apologize
to Junior right now!

08:11.325 --> 08:14.926
I'm sorry if you took
offense at my actions.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.462
Better.
I apologize

08:17.464 --> 08:20.165
if you misinterpreted
my intentions.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.602
Better!
I regret the
miscommunication.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.972
Rallo, where on Earth did you
learn to apologize like that?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.039
John Edwards.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.109
I'm sorry it took her
so long to die.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.878
Will you marry me?

08:32.880 --> 08:36.014
Rallo, what you did today
was unacceptable.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.350
Until you can give
your brother a sincere apology

08:38.352 --> 08:41.353
and stop your
childish pranks, you will...

08:41.355 --> 08:42.988
stay in your room.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.422
Okay.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.324
(sighs)

08:46.326 --> 08:48.193
Do you have
a problem with that?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.996
Well, it's not the punishment
I would have chosen,

08:50.998 --> 08:53.498
but we can discuss it when I
get back from the bathroom.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.167

08:56.169 --> 08:59.170

09:03.510 --> 09:06.011
left arm straight
on the downswing,

09:06.013 --> 09:08.346
rotate the hips and...

09:08.348 --> 09:10.148
(whimpering)

09:10.150 --> 09:12.017
Bo!
(la)

09:12.019 --> 09:13.752
Rallo! What do you
think you're doing?!

09:13.754 --> 09:17.088
Oh, it's okay to shoot
human cops in these games,

09:17.090 --> 09:19.491
but I can't kill
a small-brained seal?

09:19.493 --> 09:21.359
You shouldn't be
playing any games!

09:21.361 --> 09:22.627
You're being punished!

09:22.629 --> 09:24.029
I'm in my room,
aren't I?

09:24.031 --> 09:28.166
Ah, the sublime joys of
a womanly punishment.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.001
Cleveland,
I won't hit my kid,

09:30.003 --> 09:32.504
but I will hit
my husband.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.339
Okay! My septum!

09:34.341 --> 09:36.508
Rallo, from now on,

09:36.510 --> 09:39.744
there will be
no video games!

09:41.147 --> 09:43.148
And no Internet!

09:43.150 --> 09:44.783
No <i>Angry Birds!</i>

09:44.785 --> 09:47.018
No <i>Angry Birds</i>
<i>for Android!</i>

09:47.020 --> 09:48.987
No Kindle!

No Linkster!

09:55.162 --> 09:58.430
(Elmo giggling)
No Tickle Me Elmo!

09:58.432 --> 10:00.532
No Texas hold'em with
seven grown-up gamblers

10:00.534 --> 10:02.801
who somehow got
into your room!

10:02.803 --> 10:05.103
No dressing up
as Al Sharpton!

10:06.305 --> 10:08.373
You think you
can break me, Mama?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.475
You can't break me.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.177
You can take away my toys,

10:12.179 --> 10:14.179
but you'll never take away...

10:14.181 --> 10:16.648
my imagination.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.917
Any calls, Eleanor?

10:18.919 --> 10:19.985
No?

10:19.987 --> 10:22.087
Then bring me an old-fashioned

10:22.089 --> 10:24.155
and the afternoon papers
if they're in.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.490
(Elmo giggling)

10:25.492 --> 10:27.359
Now you tickle me.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.127
(giggling)

10:29.129 --> 10:30.929
Too hard!

10:30.931 --> 10:33.098

like I'm the one

10:33.100 --> 10:35.033
who's being
punished here.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.136
Oh, sweetie, you tried it
"yours's" way;

10:38.138 --> 10:40.872
now let me try it
"mes's" way.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.974
You know what?
Go ahead.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.442
You can't do
any worse than me.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.644
What are you gonna do?

10:45.646 --> 10:48.613
Well, Donna,
what's the one thing

10:48.615 --> 10:50.849
kids hate more than anything?

10:54.186 --> 10:58.089
But no sinner is more doomed
than the Wicked Child,

10:58.091 --> 11:01.359
who is an affront
to the mighty Harlemites

11:01.361 --> 11:04.596
who trotted the globe
to smite the Generals.

11:04.598 --> 11:08.133
As St. Lou said
to the Ferrignos,

11:08.135 --> 11:10.602
"Don't make me angry."

11:10.604 --> 11:12.937
ALL: You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.773
Amen!

11:14.775 --> 11:16.274
Rallo Tubbs?

11:16.276 --> 11:17.442
Who wants to know?

11:17.444 --> 11:18.610
You're under arrest.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.512
What?! What is
the charge?

11:20.514 --> 11:23.481
Distribution
of lewd photos of a minor.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.016
An overweight minor.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.484
That's unnecessary.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.153
We received a report
that you publicly

11:28.155 --> 11:30.288
exhibited
a naked picture of a...

11:30.290 --> 11:32.524
husky 14-year-old.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.758
Thank you.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.760
Yeah, but it was just a joke.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.962
Oh.
(laughs)

11:37.964 --> 11:39.330
You're coming downtown.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.665
(gasps)
Mama!

11:40.667 --> 11:41.966
Cleveland!

11:41.968 --> 11:44.502
REVEREND JENKINS:
Carry on, my wayward son!

11:44.504 --> 11:46.638
There'll be peace
when you are done!

11:46.640 --> 11:49.307
Lay your weary head to rest.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.444

My son

12:00.420 --> 12:02.287
You can't just
arrest little kids!

12:02.289 --> 12:03.688
Yes, we can, ma'am.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.190
The distribution
of indecent photos

12:05.192 --> 12:07.025
of children
is a zero-tolerance crime.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.526
Doesn't matter who does it.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.095
Objection, Your Honor!

12:10.097 --> 12:11.362
We're lawyered up.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.531
Len, they couldn't
have meant to punish

12:13.533 --> 12:15.467
a five-year-old
when they wrote this law.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.102
It's Mr. Stein.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.771
Who knows what they meant?
This is Virginia.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.107
It's legal to marry
your 16-year-old cousin,

12:22.109 --> 12:24.609
but illegal
to wash a mule on Sunday.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.045
♪ Thank God it's Wednesday

12:27.047 --> 12:30.115

The real problem is:

12:32.252 --> 12:34.519
Rallo's age is irrelevant

12:34.521 --> 12:36.454
as far as this law
is concerned.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.424
What?! Rallo,
it's gonna be okay.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.259
When you get in front
of that judge,

12:41.261 --> 12:43.128
you'll get the same
benefit of the doubt

12:43.130 --> 12:45.263
as any other
young black male.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.531
Guilty.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.532
Ah.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.000
Your Honor, at the risk

12:49.002 --> 12:51.002
of sounding disrespectful,
may I say

12:51.004 --> 12:53.671
that you're a moron
and your verdict is (bleep)?

12:53.673 --> 12:55.006
Oh! Uh!

12:55.008 --> 12:56.541
Oh-ho, ho-ho-ho.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.976
I don't write
the laws, ma'am.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.277
I don't even believe in them.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.279
Not anymore.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.014
Excuse me, Your Highness.

13:03.016 --> 13:06.084
Are you saying
our boy is going to prison?!

13:06.086 --> 13:08.086
Of course not.
He's five years old.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.489
He's going to juvenile hall
for six months.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.524
ALL:
What?!

13:12.526 --> 13:15.627
My baby's going away
for six months.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.296
Oh, Rallo, when you
come back, you won't

13:18.298 --> 13:21.599
recognize any
live-action shows on Fox.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.974
Master Tubbs,
you are to wait here

13:29.976 --> 13:32.677
until the bus comes to
transport you to juvenile hall.

13:32.679 --> 13:36.114
And here's a video we ask
all our inmates to watch.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.950
Hi. I'm Jaden Smith.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.852
I didn't really want
to be in this video,

13:40.854 --> 13:42.987
but apparently,
I have to be in everything.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.456
My prison is the expectations
of my parents.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.258
But your prison is prison!

13:47.260 --> 13:49.661
The (blee)
you looking!

13:51.030 --> 13:53.097
I'm getting
a "thwopsticka!"

13:53.099 --> 13:54.666
Get on the bus.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.267
(moaning)

13:56.269 --> 13:58.970
(chuckles)
He fell for it!

13:58.972 --> 14:00.772
I out-pranked
the prankster!

14:00.774 --> 14:03.141
I got to hand it to you,
Cleveland.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.144
Through a series of elaborate
and expensive setups,

14:06.146 --> 14:09.013
you managed to fool
a five-year-old.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.114
Are you ready for me now?

14:10.116 --> 14:12.483
No. Turns out we
didn't even need you.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.119
Well, good for you.
(deep inhale)

14:15.121 --> 14:15.954
(thud)
(man screams)

14:15.956 --> 14:16.988
Okay, okay. Shh.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.323
Let's go get him.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.894
Rallo, you've been
scared stra... aah!

14:25.097 --> 14:27.031
Oh, oh!

14:27.033 --> 14:28.967
Where he go?
My baby!

14:28.969 --> 14:30.535
Cleveland,
what have you done?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.971
Your stupid plan scared
him into running away.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.473
So my plan
worked too well.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.342
Surely, I can't
be faulted

14:37.344 --> 14:39.878
for such an extraordinary
level of success.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.146
Surely not.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.514
Let's find Rallo.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.583
Kids, we've got
to find Rallo!

14:45.585 --> 14:47.352
I thought he
was going to juvie.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.153
Cleveland made
all that up to scare him.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.022
Well, that was
a terrible plan!

14:51.024 --> 14:52.457
You're a terrible plan!

14:52.459 --> 14:54.759
Dah! The point is,
he's gone.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.094
He must have gone
into the woods.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.030
You went into the woods!
Dah! Let's go.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.833
But first, let's change out
of our good clothes.

15:01.835 --> 15:04.435
Heck with this!
I'm going to the mall.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.037
Then get e
a Wetzel's Pr!

15:06.039 --> 15:07.772
Ah, come on!

15:09.475 --> 15:12.443
(panting)

15:12.445 --> 15:13.978
You guys go on ahead.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.813
I need to rest.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.916
All right.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.785
♪ Slumber now

15:20.787 --> 15:23.955
♪ The sleep train's coming

15:23.957 --> 15:27.025
♪ Choo-choo down the track

15:27.027 --> 15:28.960
Dad, I don't need
to sleep.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.662
I just need
to rest my legs.

15:30.664 --> 15:31.696
Oh.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.532
I suppose that
was more for me.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.834
Oh, you're growing
up so fast.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.236
DONNA: Cleveland!
Yep!

15:40.039 --> 15:42.640
One more look.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.208
(panting)

15:45.144 --> 15:47.078
Huh. Look at that.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.013
Footprints.
My tracking badge taught me

15:49.015 --> 15:51.783
that footprints
are left by feet.

15:51.785 --> 15:55.086
These badges are very basic.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.127
A pack of gum?

16:03.129 --> 16:05.263
(snaps)
Ow! I've been Rallo'ed!

16:05.265 --> 16:07.031
Wait! Rallo!

16:07.033 --> 16:10.268
My thinking is very basic.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.970
Rallo!

16:11.972 --> 16:13.104
Rallo!

16:13.106 --> 16:15.173
Rallo!

16:15.175 --> 16:16.374
Rallo.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.042
Where'd you find
this name, "Rallo?"

16:18.044 --> 16:19.210
Sanford and Son.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.145
Oh, yeah. Fred and
Grady's friend?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.480
Mm-hmm.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.016
I got a cousin named
Fred Sanford Brown.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.118
Do you?
No. I wish.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.687
Hey, if you and me have a
baby, we could name him...

16:29.689 --> 16:31.756
(yells)

16:31.758 --> 16:33.424
We got one!

16:33.426 --> 16:35.360
Good trapping, Scouts.

16:36.362 --> 16:39.697
Cleveland, you're
not a wild boar.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.933
Looks like it's
crickets and Schlitz

16:41.935 --> 16:43.668
for dinner
again, boys.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.370
Wally, have you seen Rallo?

16:45.372 --> 16:48.172
He's run off into the woods,
and we can't find him.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.941
Oh, boo-hoo.

16:49.943 --> 16:51.943
I've lost four kids
this weekend,

16:51.945 --> 16:54.012
and you don't see me
whining about it.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.148
My breasts look all right.

17:01.453 --> 17:02.920
Hmm.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.791
Hello.
Rallo!

17:06.793 --> 17:08.426
Please don't turn me in, man!

17:08.428 --> 17:10.128
I don't want to be Jaden Smith!

17:10.130 --> 17:13.031
He's inherited his mother's
charm and his father's modesty!

17:13.033 --> 17:15.133
It's okay, Rallo. Listen.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.167
You're not going to juvie.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.435
(sobbing)

17:17.437 --> 17:19.337
What?
None of that
was real.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.339
My dad was just
pranking you back.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.941
He got your mom
and everyone in town in on it.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.110
Wow, a spanking would
have been so much easier

17:26.112 --> 17:27.979
and just as effective.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.014
Liberal parents.
What are you gonna do?

17:30.016 --> 17:32.016
Let's go.
Hell, no!

17:32.018 --> 17:33.418
This ain't over.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.953
Yay!
Naked forest party!

17:35.955 --> 17:37.822
No, I'm gonna
fake my own death.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.124
Gonna throw this
dummy off that cliff

17:40.126 --> 17:43.027
and show Mom and Cleveland
what scared really is.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.129
Then, 12 years from now,
I will return to town

17:45.131 --> 17:46.497
posing as an eccentric
millionaire.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.633
(yells)
(shrieks)

17:48.635 --> 17:51.602
(screams)

17:51.604 --> 17:53.971
(echoing):
Help!

17:53.973 --> 17:56.274
I'm his only hope.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.143
And I can do it, because I am...

17:59.145 --> 18:02.914
a Freedom Scout
expelled for sexual misconduct!

18:02.916 --> 18:05.349
This is crazy,
this is crazy, this is crazy.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.751
(grunts)

18:06.753 --> 18:09.687
Ooh, ah, ee, ooh.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.925
Look at us, tramping
around the woods,

18:13.927 --> 18:15.760
no idea where
we're going.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.162
Rallo's probably
laughing at us right now.

18:18.164 --> 18:21.032
Just sitting up
in heaven laughing at us.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.867
Look, there he is!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.137
(screaming)

18:26.139 --> 18:27.538
Rallo!

18:27.540 --> 18:29.574
Oh, my God, it's Junior!

18:31.710 --> 18:33.644
He's trying
to save Rallo!

18:33.646 --> 18:35.313
Who cares?

18:35.315 --> 18:36.647
Oh, you said "Rallo."

18:36.649 --> 18:38.316
For some reason,
I thought you said "Adam."

18:38.318 --> 18:39.817
I was like, "Who's Adam?"

18:39.819 --> 18:41.452
(laughs) Isn't that funny?

18:41.454 --> 18:44.088
But yeah, the Rallo thing.
I hope he does save him.

18:47.693 --> 18:50.862
(choking and grunting)

18:57.836 --> 18:59.337
(whimpering)

18:59.339 --> 19:00.605
Help!

19:03.142 --> 19:05.710
Wait, my floaty pants badge!

19:12.084 --> 19:14.185
Help!

19:15.287 --> 19:16.754
Damn.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.191
I think that dumb-ass
gave me a Mr. Pibb.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.329
He's shooting the rapids!

19:25.331 --> 19:28.032
R-r-r-radical!

19:28.034 --> 19:30.101
(screaming)

19:38.043 --> 19:40.711
(slowed-down yell)

19:46.985 --> 19:49.587
(both panting)

19:51.356 --> 19:52.790
Thanks, Junior.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.292
You saved my life.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.860
Of course, Rallo.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.028
You'd do it for me.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.596
Well, I agree
with the sentiment,

19:58.598 --> 19:59.864
but I just
don't see me

19:59.866 --> 20:01.532
lifting your fat ass
out of the water.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.035
Yeah, I'd probably
just drown.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.504
(both laughing)

20:08.540 --> 20:11.709
Junior, I am honored
to present to you

20:11.711 --> 20:13.144
the following merit badges:

20:13.146 --> 20:16.180
rock climbing
and whitewater rafting.

20:16.182 --> 20:19.283
Which makes you the youngest
Chief Scout ever.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.352
Never in the history
of the Scouts

20:21.354 --> 20:23.854
has anything anyone's
learned for a badge

20:23.856 --> 20:25.656
been put to actual use.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.291
These are busy-work tasks,

20:27.293 --> 20:29.327
designed to keep
young boys

20:29.329 --> 20:31.996
from sitting around,
bending their Beckhams.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.332
But that is neither here...

20:34.334 --> 20:36.300
nor...

20:36.302 --> 20:38.202
there!

20:38.204 --> 20:40.605
(crowd applauds)

20:40.607 --> 20:44.208
I'm drunk on the firewater
of personal achievement!

20:44.210 --> 20:47.478
So, Rallo, have you learned
your lesson about pranks?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.980
Absolutely.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.915
Hey, did you know
that if your hand

20:50.917 --> 20:52.583
is bigger than your face,
you're gay?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.151
Really?

20:54.153 --> 20:55.653
(deep sigh)

20:55.655 --> 20:56.954
This is big.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.956
(smack)
(Cleveland yells, Rallo laughs)

20:58.958 --> 21:00.992
CLEVELAND: Ah, now I got
a bloody nose and I'm gay!
