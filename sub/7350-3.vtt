WEBVTT

00:04.305 --> 00:08.609
* Well, there ain't
pleasing you *

00:10.111 --> 00:14.215
* Whoo-hoo-hoo

00:14.248 --> 00:17.251
* Whoa-oa-oa

00:17.285 --> 00:21.189
* Angel flirting
with the dark side *

00:21.222 --> 00:24.325
* The devil's floating
in the glass *

00:24.358 --> 00:25.526
Guys, chill.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.195
I can't concentrate.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.196
Totes buzz kill...

00:28.229 --> 00:29.497
Selfie time!

00:29.530 --> 00:32.733
Hash-tag NOLA-bound!

00:34.268 --> 00:35.636
Holy crap!

00:49.483 --> 00:51.352
Oh, my God...

01:15.576 --> 01:16.777
Um...

01:16.810 --> 01:18.646
guys...
Uh...

01:24.885 --> 01:26.854
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:26.887 --> 01:29.557
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:29.590 --> 01:32.160
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:32.193 --> 01:33.394
* How, how, how, how

01:33.427 --> 01:35.696
* Hey, hey

01:41.569 --> 01:42.870
* You gotta come on.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.511
Punch buggy!
Hey!

01:50.544 --> 01:52.346
No punch backs.
No what?

01:52.380 --> 01:54.182
Come on, everybody
knows Punch Buggy.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.383
Right, King?

01:55.416 --> 01:56.784
We called it Slug Bug.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.186
Me and my brother,
we used to play

01:58.219 --> 01:59.387
for hours in the car.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.921
By the time we got to the lake,

02:00.954 --> 02:02.923
our skin were
all kind of black and blue.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.426
What about you, Brody?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.261
What'd your family
do on car trips?

02:07.295 --> 02:09.263
In our family, road trips
meant getting dumped off

02:09.297 --> 02:10.798
at boarding school
every September.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.167
That's kind of...

02:13.201 --> 02:15.436
...depressing, I know.
Moving on.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.608
BRODY:
Linda.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.276
Mm-hmm.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.844
Are... are you gonna...

02:23.877 --> 02:25.413
answer?

02:25.446 --> 02:26.847
Just gonna let it
go to voicemail.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.319
She wants me to...

02:31.352 --> 02:33.354
go see another
couples therapist with her.

02:33.387 --> 02:36.190
Well, that's great
y'all keep working on things.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.307
Guessing you're not here

02:53.341 --> 02:55.309
to settle up your poker tab,
Agent Pride.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.245
Considering you robbed
me blind last time?

02:57.278 --> 02:58.446
Not a chance,
Lieutenant.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.314
You were in
over your head.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.615
Just like, uh, Agent Lasalle was

03:01.649 --> 03:02.950
the last time we went drinking.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.953
I had a cold.
Hi, I'm Addie Watkins.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.621
SECO out of Naval Air
Station, New Orleans.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.223
Special Agent Meredith Brody.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.491
Catch us up, Addie.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.326
Armored transport bus

03:12.360 --> 03:14.428
carrying four
Naval Brig detainees

03:14.462 --> 03:16.464
from New Orleans
to Charleston

03:16.497 --> 03:18.799
traveling northbound at
approximately 8:30 a.m.,

03:18.832 --> 03:20.501
crossed over the
double yellow

03:20.534 --> 03:21.735
until point of impact.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.737
Rolled once...

03:24.772 --> 03:26.474
...landed here.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.476
Marshals are still sifting
through the wreckage,

03:28.509 --> 03:30.344
but, so far,
we have three dead,

03:30.378 --> 03:31.945
three unaccounted for.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.248
We're waiting for the prison
manifest to confirm names.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.517
Any witnesses?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.818
The girls were making a
pilgrimage to New Orleans

03:37.851 --> 03:40.020
when the bus nearly
hit them head-on.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.390
Bourbon Street or bust.
Bust, clearly.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.891
ADDIE:
They pull over to see

03:43.924 --> 03:45.293
if they could help,
that's when the prisoners

03:45.326 --> 03:46.827
jacked their car and took off.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.862
Because of the time-sensitive
nature of this case,

03:48.896 --> 03:51.299
Lieutenant Watkins is here

03:51.332 --> 03:53.367
to expedite anything
we may need from the Navy.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.568
Y'all just let me know
what you need,

03:54.602 --> 03:55.703
I'll get it done.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.605
Excuse me.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.307
Okay, one of you go over there

03:59.340 --> 04:01.275
and take statements
from the young ladies, please.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.646
All you, Lasalle.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.516
Guess I'll take one
for the team.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.386
Sweet Loretta...

04:12.420 --> 04:14.388
what is the story,
morning glory?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.690
Story is three dead.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.728
Guards were shot at close range.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.531
Prisoner's C.O.D. is unclear.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.334
Holster's empty.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.568
Yeah, it's likely
they were killed

04:27.601 --> 04:29.703
with one of their
own weapons.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.572
So that means, likely,

04:31.605 --> 04:33.907
that our escapees are armed.

04:33.941 --> 04:37.345
All right.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.012
Do a thorough sweep,

04:39.046 --> 04:40.581
top to bottom,

04:40.614 --> 04:42.583
before it gets hauled off site.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.386
Prison manifest,
hot off the press.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.493
According to this,
our three escapees

04:52.526 --> 04:54.061
are Lieutenant Ted Nash,

04:54.094 --> 04:55.796
Seaman Recruit
Levon Dalton...

04:57.765 --> 05:00.534
...and Matt S. O'Feeney.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.670
BRODY: Why are you so focused
on that last name?

05:02.703 --> 05:05.473
Who's Matt S. O'Feeney?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.107
He's an anagram,

05:07.140 --> 05:09.810
is who he is.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.814
Matt S. O'Feeney.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.616
Rearrange the letters...

05:15.649 --> 05:17.385
"enemy of state."

05:17.418 --> 05:20.621
Glad to see you're still
doing the morning crosswords.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.956
Every day, Gibbs.
Keeps me spry.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.958
VANCE:
So SECNAV just confirmed:

05:24.992 --> 05:27.895
Matt S. O'Feeney is none other
than Dmitry Babakov.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.597
The arms dealer?

05:29.630 --> 05:30.698
That's one of his
many talents.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.899
Smuggling, extortion,

05:31.932 --> 05:35.369
human trafficking,
espionage.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.371
Gibbs and his team had
been tracking Babakov

05:37.405 --> 05:38.839
in conjunction with the CIA

05:38.872 --> 05:41.008
and Homeland Security
for a year.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.976
Three weeks ago,
Babakov was captured

05:43.010 --> 05:45.646
in a top-secret raid off
the west coast of Africa.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.582
VANCE: We placed Babakov aboard
the U.S.S. Birmingham

05:48.616 --> 05:50.117
for transport to New Orleans.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.553
We then put him
on an armored bus

05:52.586 --> 05:55.623
headed to Navconbrig Charleston,
to await sentencing.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.791
Unfortunately, that trip
got cut a little short.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.727
We'll make it right
for you, brother.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.429
VANCE:
Pride...

06:01.462 --> 06:03.431
Babakov's capture offered

06:03.464 --> 06:05.098
a rare opportunity for the DOD

06:05.132 --> 06:07.435
to gain insight
into a vast network

06:07.468 --> 06:09.437
of combatant operations.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.539
Mission's clear, Dwayne.
Find Babakov...

06:11.572 --> 06:13.574
Bring him in alive.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.752
All right.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.554
We got three escaped
convicts on the loose,

06:26.587 --> 06:28.622
all certified Navy-issue.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.892
Agent Gibbs is coordinating
with interagency

06:31.925 --> 06:35.563
to get us the most up to date
information on our fugitives.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.098
Addie, here, is gonna
tell us what we know.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.700
Okay.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.436
Top priority is Dmitry Babakov,

06:42.470 --> 06:45.673
international concierge
to the scum of the earth.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.107
Highly educated and
well-connected,

06:47.140 --> 06:48.676
Babakov brokers

06:48.709 --> 06:51.512
black market goods
to the highest bidder.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.880
We're talking
weapons, narcotics,

06:52.913 --> 06:54.114
information...
even people.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.983
Real Renaissance man, huh?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.918
One whose
clientele includes

06:57.951 --> 06:59.853
some of this
country's biggest

06:59.887 --> 07:01.489
national security
threats.
Hard to believe

07:01.522 --> 07:03.190
someone could pull off
that escape on their own.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.593
Guessing he got help from
one of his fellow jumpsuits.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.860
Which brings us to...

07:06.894 --> 07:08.596
Seaman Recruit
Levon Dalton.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.864
Dalton enlisted J-O-M

07:10.898 --> 07:12.633
after a handful of
brushes with the law.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.603
It seems the Navy didn't
straighten Levon out much.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.905
After several
earlier infractions,

07:17.938 --> 07:19.873
Dalton was most
recently thrown

07:19.907 --> 07:21.141
into the Birmingham brig

07:21.174 --> 07:23.611
for striking
a commanding officer.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.913
ADDIE:
Last, but not least...

07:25.946 --> 07:27.681
Lieutenant Ted Nash.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.483
Two weeks ago,

07:29.517 --> 07:32.019
Nash was a hard-working
naval architect

07:32.052 --> 07:34.655
in the shipyards at Pascagoula.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.825
Then he took liberty
here in New Orleans,

07:37.858 --> 07:39.159
got into an ugly
bar fight,

07:39.192 --> 07:41.194
landed himself in jail.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.030
Nash's service
record is pristine.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.032
The fight was his
first offense.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.901
He was looking at a fraction
of the time the others were.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.169
And yet he ran. Why?

07:49.202 --> 07:50.671
We got a BOLO out on

07:50.704 --> 07:52.706
our stolen convertible,
checkpoints at

07:52.740 --> 07:54.174
every county and parish line,

07:54.207 --> 07:56.944
eyes and ears on all
our fugitives' contacts.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.547
Chris and Brody...

07:59.580 --> 08:01.949
head over to Navy Landing,

08:01.982 --> 08:03.817
canvass the Birmingham,

08:03.851 --> 08:05.052
find out everything you can

08:05.085 --> 08:06.720
on Babakov and Dalton.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.955
Meantime, Addie...

08:07.988 --> 08:10.257
speak to your contacts
at the shipyard.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.559
Get a run-down on Nash.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.026
Go. Learn.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.729
But most of all, be smart.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.998
Death toll is three.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.202
Let's not make it
climb any higher.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.739
GARLAND:
Prisoner A was brought
aboard the vessel

08:25.773 --> 08:27.074
six days ago,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.876
after his capture in
a classified land raid.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.678
Prisoner A is Babakov?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.280
It's common protocol not
to address prisoners by name

08:33.313 --> 08:35.282
for security
clearance reasons.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.917
Each morning, the prisoner

08:36.950 --> 08:38.819
was escorted to interrogation

08:38.852 --> 08:40.253
by two Masters-at-Arms.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.923
Afterwards, he was escorted
back to this cell

08:42.956 --> 08:44.558
where he was served his meal

08:44.592 --> 08:46.026
before retiring
to bed for the night.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.928
Just got a single
bed here, so...

08:47.961 --> 08:50.197
no pillow talk?
Chit

08:50.230 --> 08:51.264
BRODY:
We just want to make sure

08:51.298 --> 08:54.134
Babakov didn't have any contact

08:54.167 --> 08:55.869
with any of his neighbors.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.671
I assure you, he did not.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.106
The prisoner was kept
in isolation

08:59.139 --> 09:00.674
from all other detainees.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.576
LASALLE:
Houston, we have a problem.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.845
Lasalle?

09:06.279 --> 09:07.715
Where did you go?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.022
So much for full isolation.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.725
Who was held in this cell?

09:17.758 --> 09:18.992
Prisoner B--

09:19.026 --> 09:20.994
Seaman Recruit Levon Dalton.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.864
It's a cozy joint
to plot an escape.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.599
Afternoon, Loretta.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.767
Hey.
Sebastian.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.603
Tell me something interesting.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.271
SEBASTIAN:
Well, the human
body produces

09:31.304 --> 09:32.873
25 million new cells
each second.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.842
Okay.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.009
That was interesting.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.878
Now, how about
something useful?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.613
Oh, well, you didn't say that.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.882
It's important to be
linguistically specific.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.116
WADE:
The driver and the guard

09:43.150 --> 09:45.018
were shot point blank.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.887
Ballistics confirms
that the bullets

09:46.920 --> 09:49.857
came from
the guard's M11.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.292
The prisoner, on the
other hand, was strangled.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.294
Not an easy feat,
given his size.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.730
Babakov doesn't weigh
more than 140 soaking wet.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.899
Nash isn't much bigger.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.334
Which means the only escapee
with the physical capacity

10:01.368 --> 10:04.672
to strangle the victim would
be Levon "The Levee" Dalton.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.640
I gave Dalton

10:06.674 --> 10:07.808
a pro-wrestling moniker.

10:07.841 --> 10:08.876
On account of his size,

10:08.909 --> 10:10.644
which is ample.

10:10.678 --> 10:13.313
So you think Dalton
killed the prisoner?

10:13.346 --> 10:14.882
Hmm, it's possible,
but I'll know more

10:14.915 --> 10:16.349
when I complete
my virtual crash reconstruction,

10:16.383 --> 10:18.686
using evidence culled
from the bus wreckage.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.654
Why they pay you
the big bucks.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.023
Well, not exactly
Daddy War-bucks.

10:23.056 --> 10:26.794
Then again, better than a
barista at Star... bucks.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.929
Just take the compliment, kid.
Yeah, sure.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.032
BRODY: You understand
Lieutenant Nash is on the loose.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.834
I can't believe Ted escaped.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.203
So, your fiancé
hasn't contacted you?

10:36.236 --> 10:38.205
Ex...

10:38.238 --> 10:40.207
fiancé.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.175
Ted and I broke it off
last month.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.311
I'm sorry to hear that.
Me, too.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.780
He was everything
I was looking for.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.682
Like, you know how people
say the best way

10:48.716 --> 10:51.184
to test a relationship
is to travel together?

10:51.218 --> 10:52.686
First year we were together,

10:52.720 --> 10:55.122
we took this crazy trip
to Europe.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.125
Six countries in three weeks.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.392
Sounds amazing.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.662
Best time of my life.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.833
Until we got back.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.268
Guess it was
the being at home part

11:08.301 --> 11:09.703
we weren't great at.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.104
How so?

11:11.138 --> 11:15.008
Ted had major trust issues.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.010
I think it came from being

11:17.044 --> 11:19.446
an army brat--
his family moved around

11:19.479 --> 11:21.915
a ton until his dad got
permanently stationed

11:21.949 --> 11:23.917
in Hong Kong, when he was 13.

11:23.951 --> 11:29.422
If Ted tries to reach out,
we need to know, okay?

11:29.456 --> 11:33.226
I hope he does 'cause...
I'd really like

11:33.260 --> 11:35.328
to tell him
I'm still here for him.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.098
No matter what.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.835
Focus, kids. 24 hours in,

11:41.869 --> 11:43.871
we still got close to nothing.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.372
SEBASTIAN: Welcome, cinephiles.
Please take your seats.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.174
Show's about to begin.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.109
No popcorn?
No thank you.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.878
So, I've simulated
the accident

11:50.911 --> 11:52.045
down to pre-impact speeds,

11:52.079 --> 11:53.814
post-impact movement,

11:53.847 --> 11:55.415
as well as taking into
account the velocity-impact

11:55.448 --> 11:56.483
time model of the driver's

11:56.516 --> 11:57.751
crash avoidance maneuver.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.152
Make sense?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.121
Good. So...

12:01.154 --> 12:03.023
here is our armored bus

12:03.056 --> 12:04.892
driving northbound on the road.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.894
Drifts into
the next lane,

12:06.927 --> 12:09.496
narrowly missing a convertible
full of buxom beauties.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.264
BRODY:
Bikinis?

12:11.298 --> 12:12.265
An interesting touch.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.366
Well, an artist must allow

12:13.400 --> 12:14.768
for indulgences.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.236
I can appreciate that.
So...

12:16.269 --> 12:17.404
adding into the equation
the notion

12:17.437 --> 12:19.106
that Babakov and Dalton had

12:19.139 --> 12:20.874
the ability to communicate
in the brig

12:20.908 --> 12:23.110
as well as the physical evidence
that Dalton had the power

12:23.143 --> 12:24.411
necessary to strangle
the prisoner,

12:24.444 --> 12:26.780
we recreate the moments
before the crash.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.549
Dalton begins
strangling the prisoner,

12:29.582 --> 12:31.551
intentionally drawing
the attention of the guard,

12:31.584 --> 12:33.286
who is lured
from his secure environ,

12:33.320 --> 12:34.788
oh, only to be ambushed

12:34.822 --> 12:35.789
by Babakov,

12:35.823 --> 12:38.191
who is stealthily lying in wait.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.527
And spoiler alert:
we know how that story ends.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.996
Babakov and Dalton
were partners in crime.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.765
Pride.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.037
Got it. Thanks.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.139
BOLO on the convertible
we put out--

12:52.172 --> 12:53.373
got a hit in Pearl River.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.008
Let's go.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.410
Good work, Sebastian.
Thanks, Sebastian.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.425
Local farmhand
heard shots fired.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.827
They killed the trooper.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.295
We set up a perimeter,

13:15.328 --> 13:16.897
but so far, there's
no movement inside.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.018
PRIDE:
NCIS!

13:38.051 --> 13:39.152
Federal agents!

14:31.004 --> 14:32.539
Hey, kiddo.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.943
It's all right, kiddo.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.645
Okay, stand down, everyone.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.880
You're safe.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.256
It's okay.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.272
How you doing, Remy?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.376
Got a hold of your mom
at the diner.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.078
She's on her way.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.712
She's gonna be mad.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.614
She told me
not to come here.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.383
She said it was dangerous.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.221
Probably right.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.392
I was setting up my platoons

15:25.425 --> 15:27.394
when I heard shouting.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.229
Then shots.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.630
PRIDE: I imagine
that was scary.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.265
I hid in the cupboard.

15:32.299 --> 15:35.602
But the voices,
they got closer.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.005
How many were there?

15:38.038 --> 15:40.073
Two.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.509
One of them sounded
a little funny.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.344
Funny... funny how?

15:44.377 --> 15:46.446
PRIDE:
Like a, like an accent?

15:46.479 --> 15:48.481
Like, someone from
a different country?

15:50.517 --> 15:52.285
Can you remember
anything you heard?

15:55.122 --> 15:58.358
Look, I... I get it, kiddo.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.328
I hate talking about
scary stuff, too.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.263
Yeah, no. It's true.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.764
Even big guys like
me get spooked.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.601
But the thing is,
once I do talk about it,

16:08.635 --> 16:11.438
I always end up
feeling better.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.107
They kept talking about a grave.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.344
A grave?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.612
PRIDE:
Are

16:19.646 --> 16:22.315
They were arguing
about how long

16:22.349 --> 16:24.351
it would take to make it.

16:29.556 --> 16:33.460
Remy... those men...

16:33.493 --> 16:35.728
they're never gonna hurt you.

16:37.097 --> 16:42.102
And-and what you
just told me...

16:42.135 --> 16:45.738
is gonna help me make sure that
they never hurt anyone again.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.722
You're one of us now, kiddo.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.492
WOMAN:
Oh, Remy!

17:08.095 --> 17:09.429
I was worried sick about you.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.730
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.

17:10.763 --> 17:11.831
You sure?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.833
Oh.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.336
Come on, baby,
let's go, let's go.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.205
Let's go, baby.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.741
We looked, we haven't found
anything resembling a grave.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.210
Didn't show much
respect for the dead

17:23.243 --> 17:24.711
when it came to that trooper.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.079
It could've been a code.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.081
Maybe a misinterpreted
foreign language?

17:28.115 --> 17:29.749
Let's run
a forensic language test,

17:29.782 --> 17:33.153
cross-referenced with any
languages Babakov speaks.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.154
All right.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.488
What's the latest?

17:35.522 --> 17:36.756
Kid places two men
in the cabin.

17:36.789 --> 17:37.757
One with an accent.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.159
That puts Babakov there.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.460
Yeah, and based
on what we know,

17:40.493 --> 17:41.494
it's likely Dalton
was with him.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.730
That leaves Nash in the wind.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.798
Trooper man got a shot off.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.435
Which means one of them
might be injured.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.503
We should sweep
the cabin for blood.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.671
And put every hospital

17:51.704 --> 17:54.507
within three parishes on alert.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.144
Trooper's time of death
puts our fugitives

17:57.177 --> 17:59.646
less than four miles away,
if traveling on foot.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.314
And if one of them's injured,

18:01.348 --> 18:03.183
that's not helping with
their ground speed.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.518
Well, the nearest paved road's
five miles north.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.187
We cut that off,
we can tighten the net.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.555
Any other way out?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.190
Canal, lake?

18:10.223 --> 18:12.259
Train?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.394
Get me schedules of every
train that comes through here--

18:14.427 --> 18:16.296
origin, destination...

18:16.329 --> 18:18.265
surveillance footage
from every station.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.866
You got it.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.302
Levon Dalton's sister
in Mobile just got

18:22.335 --> 18:23.836
a text saying "On my way."

18:23.870 --> 18:25.438
Kicker is
the phone number belongs

18:25.472 --> 18:27.807
to the dead prison guard.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.409
Unless she was
talking to a ghost,

18:29.442 --> 18:31.611
our boy Levon's
headed back to 'Bama.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.752
I bid you
good night, Loretta.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.589
Ah, good,
you're still here.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.890
Uh, actually, I'm not here.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.558
I'm just on my way out
for a date.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.826
Oh.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.261
Well, not a date, per se.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.796
More like a casual drink.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.731
But I've run the numbers
and found that one libation

18:51.764 --> 18:53.533
does have a strong
statistical possibility

18:53.566 --> 18:55.502
of evolving
into a full-fledged meal.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.570
Which then, of course, would
constitute an actual date.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.340
Well, I'm glad to see you're
not over-thinking it, dear.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.441
So how can I help?

19:01.474 --> 19:02.642
Great.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.178
Our prisoner was
strangled to death.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.646
Mm-hmm.
He also has

19:06.679 --> 19:08.748
significant
large intestine damage...

19:08.781 --> 19:10.750
yet has no history

19:10.783 --> 19:13.286
of prior stomach issues.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.789
Then...

19:16.823 --> 19:18.925
there's our poor
state trooper here.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.361
Bullet to the heart,
and yet he, too,

19:21.394 --> 19:23.730
has significant large
intestine damage.

19:23.763 --> 19:24.897
How do two men with

19:24.931 --> 19:26.866
no prior history
of stomach issues,

19:26.899 --> 19:29.369
killed in completely
different manners,

19:29.402 --> 19:32.272
end up with the same symptoms?

19:32.305 --> 19:33.973
I'm gathering that this is
not a rhetorical question?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.775
One that could wait
until after my drink

19:35.808 --> 19:37.477
that could possibly
turn into a date?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.479
Sebastian...

19:39.512 --> 19:41.248
have you ever considered

19:41.281 --> 19:43.616
the statistical possibilities

19:43.650 --> 19:46.786
of playing hard to get?

19:59.566 --> 20:03.670
Ah... you smell that?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.473
Burnt rubber and...

20:06.506 --> 20:08.241
a little skunk?

20:08.275 --> 20:11.511
Fresh-cut Bermuda
and long-leaf pine.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.945
Now, that's home.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.714
Don't you think
you're romanticizing

20:14.747 --> 20:16.716
this "sweet home Alabama" thing,
just a little?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.017
No, not romanticizing.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.652
Appreciating.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.654
Which is something you're
clearly not good at doing.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.955
What's that supposed to mean?

20:22.989 --> 20:24.557
Well, it means

20:24.591 --> 20:26.493
you gotta stay somewhere
long enough to get hooked.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.329
I mean, the past seven years
you've moved, what, four times?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.830
Well, Cedar Rapids
was too small.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.265
And St. Paul was freezing.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.900
And Chicago was
completely congested.

20:33.933 --> 20:37.870
Did you ever consider you got
your criteria wrong, Brody?

20:37.904 --> 20:41.040
Home isn't the place,
it's the people.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.413
Got another hit.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.415
The eyes we put
on Levon's sister report

20:48.448 --> 20:51.684
she's on the move and headed
toward Mobile Memorial Hospital.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.586
If Babakov or Dalton
are injured,

20:53.620 --> 20:54.987
they might be heading for help.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.557
Let's go give them
a real special welcome.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.518
NCIS, hands in the air.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.054
Hey! Hands up.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.593
Welcome home, Lavon.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.894
Where is he?

21:34.927 --> 21:35.995
Where's Babakov?

21:36.028 --> 21:37.830
Who the hell is Babakov?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.415
You and Babakov were
in adjoining cells.

21:55.448 --> 21:58.385
You had a direct line of
communication through the vent.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.453
He was a voice
with an accent.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.522
Far as I knew, just
another thug on the block.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.856
Who you planned
an escape with.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.859
Like I told you,
I wasn't planning anything.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.362
I was sleeping
when it went down.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.131
Woke up when I felt the bus
go over the side of the road.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.833
When it stopped,
I looked around,

22:13.866 --> 22:15.602
I clocked the guard's
cuff keys laying there.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.370
I saw an opportunity, and
I took it-- simple as that.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.671
Nothing's as simple as that.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.907
I ain't stupid.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.611
No matter how you slice it,
I'm going away for a long time.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.113
Even if I did know something
about ol' Baba Ganoush,

22:27.146 --> 22:29.849
I got no incentive
to tell you about it.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.755
Look at you
working the system.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.658
This the... the translation
thingamajig?

22:38.691 --> 22:40.727
Yep. In addition to English,
Babakov's fluent

22:40.760 --> 22:42.429
in French, Russian, and Farsi.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.697
Running translation software
on all three

22:44.731 --> 22:46.132
to see if any phrases
with "grave"

22:46.165 --> 22:47.667
have a phonetic equivalent.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.135
So far-- zip.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.003
What about the other one?

22:51.037 --> 22:54.441
LASALLE: Security footage
from regional train stations.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.142
Facial recognition program
will alert us

22:56.175 --> 22:58.478
if it gets a match
on one of our fugitives.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.713
Hmm!

23:00.747 --> 23:04.884
You don't worry much about,
uh, cholesterol, do you?

23:04.917 --> 23:08.120
Try not to worry
about anything, Lasalle.

23:08.154 --> 23:11.491
You only live once, you might as
well enjoy it while you got it.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.160
Don't mind if I do.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.463
PRIDE: How's it
going over there?

23:16.496 --> 23:19.031
Your boy, here, is
a multi-tasking machine.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.900
Add this to the mix.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.102
Followed up
on that hunch

23:23.135 --> 23:24.771
about Levon being
at the hospital

23:24.804 --> 23:27.440
without any
significant injuries.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.908
Mother's sick.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.743
Cancer, stage four.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.716
Facial recognition in
the surveillance got a hit.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.950
PRIDE:
That's Babakov.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.052
And look who his
traveling companion is.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.554
Nash looked up at the camera.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.955
Now, why would he do that?

23:42.989 --> 23:44.457
'Cause he's sending a message.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.659
Look at what he drew
on his right arm.

23:46.693 --> 23:47.994
Can you magnify the shot?

23:49.095 --> 23:50.730
PRIDE:
What is that?

23:50.763 --> 23:53.833
Marryat symbol, used by
the merchant navies in the 1800s

23:53.866 --> 23:55.802
to signal danger or distress.

23:55.835 --> 23:59.939
Babakov's bringing Nash along
as a human shield.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.208
Care if I join you?

24:02.241 --> 24:04.110
Be my guest.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.216
You and I got a lot in common.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.951
Is that so?

24:11.984 --> 24:15.221
Both 'Bama boys,
born and raised.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.023
And if you're anything like me,

24:17.056 --> 24:18.991
you got a lot of love
for your hometown.

24:20.860 --> 24:24.096
It's pretty ballsy of you
to go back there.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.732
Must've had
a real good reason.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.834
Granny's red velvet cake.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.503
Your mama's real sick,
isn't she?

24:37.276 --> 24:39.211
How long she have?

24:39.245 --> 24:43.550
Doctor thought she'd be gone
a month ago.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.251
Still hanging on.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.757
Raised five kids on her own.

24:50.790 --> 24:54.293
Be real nice to give her
peace of mind before she goes.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.529
Let her know you're okay.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.700
You'd...

25:00.733 --> 25:02.268
you'd let me do that?

25:02.301 --> 25:06.238
What can you tell us
about Babakov and Nash?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.542
What you got?

25:09.576 --> 25:10.710
LASALLE: Lavon's got
nothing on Babakov

25:10.743 --> 25:11.978
using Nash as
a human shield.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.780
But he did say, when
Babakov was in the Brig,

25:13.813 --> 25:16.248
he bragged about having a
"get out of jail free card."

25:16.282 --> 25:18.685
Babakov was gonna
cut a deal.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.854
Question is, what information
was he going to give up?

25:23.823 --> 25:25.191
Pull the notes
from Babakov's interrogation.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.267
Redacted.

25:36.903 --> 25:40.873
Text me if we get any hits
on Babakov or Nash.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.208
LASALLE:
Where you going, King?

25:42.241 --> 25:44.176
Find out why we're being
kept in the dark.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.122
PRIDE:
Thank you.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.906
Hell of a place to
meet for coffee.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.742
But... secure.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.978
Help me out, Gibbs.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.814
Need to know what was in
Babakov's interrogation file.

26:21.848 --> 26:23.716
Heavily redacted.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.186
That's why I'm on a ship
in the middle of the Atlantic.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.290
Anything that's there,
I need to know.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.693
You got to read
me in on it.

26:33.726 --> 26:36.262
Contact of mine at Langley went
to the director.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.197
Got it declassified.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.071
Read it, burn it.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.942
Couldn't have just
led with that?

26:54.313 --> 26:56.649
BRODY:
Let me guess:

26:56.683 --> 26:57.884
Beach Babes Five?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.886
Sorry, wrong genre entirely.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.421
Go.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.223
Other than a slight
over-arching of the wrist,

27:04.256 --> 27:06.693
this Sonu Strike is
a perfect example

27:06.726 --> 27:08.194
of classic Dim Mak warfare.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.328
Dim

27:09.361 --> 27:10.797
Dim Mak.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.131
It's an ancient
Chinese combat technique

27:12.164 --> 27:13.866
in which pressure points
are used to disable

27:13.900 --> 27:15.668
or disorient the opponent.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.004
The Sonu Strike, in particular,
causes changes in blood flow

27:18.037 --> 27:19.305
that can damage
the large intestine.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.773
Like the injuries
the Prisoner

27:20.807 --> 27:22.074
and State Trooper
suffered.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.776
Yeah. Historically,
Dim Mak was taught

27:23.810 --> 27:25.111
to warriors of smaller stature,

27:25.144 --> 27:26.846
so that they could take down
larger opponents

27:26.879 --> 27:28.781
before going in for the kill.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.950
Which proves, by the way,
size doesn't always matter.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.118
Speak for yourself, buddy.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.986
He's talking
about Babakov.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.723
The fact that he'd be able
to pull it off on his own.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.190
Well, if he'd been trained
in Dim Mak, he would.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.391
But I doubt
that's the case.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.193
Why's that?

27:41.227 --> 27:43.295
Because Dim Mak is only taught
by trained Chinese masters.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.330
Takes years to perfect.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.065
According to his profile,

27:46.098 --> 27:47.433
Babakov didn't spend
significant time in Asia.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.401
But, we know someone
else who did--

27:49.435 --> 27:53.072
Nash's ex-fiancée said that
he lived in Hong Kong as a kid.

27:53.105 --> 27:56.342
Which means Nash could've helped
orchestrate the bus crash.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.945
Which would rule out
his being held under duress.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.814
Then what was Nash's
connection to Babakov?

28:01.848 --> 28:04.350
PRIDE: I think I can
help out with that.

28:04.383 --> 28:08.287
According to the un-redacted
transcripts I just read,

28:08.320 --> 28:12.191
Babakov's "get out of jail" card
was the identity

28:12.224 --> 28:13.893
of a U.S. intelligence leak.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.061
A mole.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.095
Someone who was passing

28:16.128 --> 28:17.897
classified military secrets

28:17.930 --> 28:20.166
to Babakov, so he could sell
them on the black market.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.901
SEBASTIAN: Nash's job
as a naval architect

28:21.934 --> 28:24.103
would've given him access
to ship schematics,

28:24.136 --> 28:26.372
weapons systems,
radar technology, the works.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.040
Kind of intelligence

28:28.074 --> 28:30.743
that could seriously compromise
national security.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.912
No wonder Nash and his
ex-fiancée had trust issues.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.446
He's been playing everyone
for years.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.248
Right down to
the human shield act.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.451
So, Babakov gets captured
by U.S. forces.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.387
Nash gets wind of it,

28:41.420 --> 28:44.256
knows that he's Babakov's most
valuable bargaining chip,

28:44.290 --> 28:47.459
decides that he, Nash,
will get to Babakov

28:47.493 --> 28:49.195
before his cover's blown.

28:56.002 --> 28:58.137
Hotline got a tip placing
Babakov and Nash

28:58.170 --> 29:01.173
exiting a train station near
Moss Point, Mississippi.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.556
Are we almost there?

29:17.589 --> 29:19.558
Close.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.131
I'm going to ask you
one more time:

29:25.164 --> 29:27.233
Did you tell them my name?

29:27.266 --> 29:29.969
How many more times must we go
through this?

29:30.002 --> 29:31.370
As many as it takes for me
to believe you.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.839
I dangled the carrot

29:32.872 --> 29:34.974
by telling them
there was a mole.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.910
I never told them who.

29:37.944 --> 29:40.512
Eh

29:40.546 --> 29:42.448
Yes.
All right.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.152
Friends?
Always.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.457
And then there was one.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.972
The bus crash was days ago.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.241
Why would Nash wait
until now to kill Babakov?

30:42.274 --> 30:45.077
Needed time to make
his hometown hero act.

30:45.111 --> 30:47.146
Or he needed to get some
information from him.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.281
Either way,
song remains the same.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.950
We got a fugitive on the loose.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.551
And he's a low-down dirty rat.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.220
Nash grew up in Hong Kong.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.022
Which means he knows Cantonese.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.324
So, if the kid did hear
the word "grave"...

30:58.357 --> 31:00.559
Cross-reference Cantonese
with word match.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.194
How long will that take?

31:02.228 --> 31:05.131
Considering there's over
a 100,000 characters?

31:05.164 --> 31:06.966
I wouldn't hold your breath.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.402
Hang on a sec...

31:10.436 --> 31:13.305
Babakov's body was found in
Moss Point, Mississippi, right?

31:13.339 --> 31:15.041
Let me check something.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.375
Here we go.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.576
Brody, see if you can
triangulate

31:17.609 --> 31:19.178
his position.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.147
They weren't
speaking Chinese

31:21.180 --> 31:24.083
or talking about
burying dead bodies.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.052
Where do ships
go to die?

31:26.085 --> 31:27.653
Grave dock.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.288
Just so happens there's
an abandoned one

31:29.321 --> 31:31.390
a stone's throw away
from Moss Point.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.425
Nash must be
meeting a boat there

31:33.459 --> 31:35.427
to make his escape.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.563
With Babakov dead,
Nash is our only link

31:37.596 --> 31:39.565
to the intelligence breech.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.268
The country's national security
depends on finding out

31:42.301 --> 31:44.236
what information
he passed along.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.672
Nash is headed to the Gulf.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.240
We've alerted the Coast Guard.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.409
Plan is to cut him off

31:50.442 --> 31:52.278
before he gets
to the grave dock.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.546
Don't want to risk losing him
in international waters.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.015
The target has changed,

31:56.048 --> 31:57.549
but the mandate
remains the same:

31:57.583 --> 32:01.220
capture Nash and
bring him in... alive.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.006
PRIDE:
What do we know?

32:20.039 --> 32:21.573
OFFICER: We've cut off
all other paths.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.075
He's gotta
come this way.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.143
County's been called,
helo's inbound.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.211
Parker, grab a couple guys--

32:25.244 --> 32:26.478
There he is.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.315
OFFICER: Murray, down!
Mike, get down!

32:29.348 --> 32:32.118
PRIDE: Cover the perimeter.
We're going in.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.346
NCIS!
Stop right there!

33:01.513 --> 33:03.582
Oh, it's on like "Donkey Kong."

33:13.625 --> 33:15.461
:
Come on...

33:15.494 --> 33:17.596
where are you,
you dirty little rat?

33:17.629 --> 33:20.066
Show yourself...

33:44.490 --> 33:47.293
Pride! Brody! Heads up!

33:52.264 --> 33:53.565
Nash!

33:56.502 --> 33:58.070
I apply pressure,

33:58.104 --> 34:00.038
she's dead
before she hits the floor.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.409
You turn around,

34:03.442 --> 34:06.245
let me walk out of here,

34:06.278 --> 34:07.646
and she's all yours.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.148
I can't do that.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.782
But if you
let her go,

34:10.816 --> 34:13.285
I promise you
you'll get out of here

34:13.319 --> 34:15.421
in bracelets
instead of a body bag.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.290
What's it going to be?

34:18.324 --> 34:20.292
Let her go, Nash.

34:20.326 --> 34:21.593
Wrong answer.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.615
You all right?

34:43.649 --> 34:45.251
Yep.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.119
Yes, you are.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.860
VANCE:
You disobeyed a direct order,

34:54.893 --> 34:58.330
Agent Pride,
which puts us in the dark.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.866
We've no clue what
intel Nash compromised

35:00.899 --> 35:02.534
or who Babakov
was selling it to.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.770
Needless to say,

35:04.803 --> 35:07.206
there's fallout.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.740
Both the CIA and SECNAV

35:08.774 --> 35:11.343
want an internal investigation.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.212
With all due respect, Director,

35:13.245 --> 35:14.513
you want me to make a choice

35:14.546 --> 35:16.382
between a traitor

35:16.415 --> 35:17.783
and one of my own,

35:17.816 --> 35:20.686
I'll take the shot every time.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.890
You want my badge,

35:24.923 --> 35:26.558
you know where to find me.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.835
That a wrap, Lieutenant?

35:36.868 --> 35:38.670
Yeah, I'm done
with all my paperwork,

35:38.704 --> 35:40.372
so it's back to base.

35:40.406 --> 35:42.708
There's no security
without the SECO officer.

35:42.741 --> 35:43.875
You're not even
out the door yet,

35:43.909 --> 35:44.876
and I'm feeling less secure.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.813
Can I ask you
a question?

35:47.846 --> 35:49.215
Shoot.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.482
Why haven't we...

35:50.516 --> 35:52.718
Dated?

35:52.751 --> 35:54.420
You know, that's funny,

35:54.453 --> 35:55.821
'cause I was just asking
myself the same thing.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.956
Come up with anything?

35:57.989 --> 36:00.459
'Cause in about two seconds,
we'd be broken up,

36:00.492 --> 36:02.694
crossing paths at work,
and that would just be...

36:02.728 --> 36:03.762
Uncomfortable.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.497
Bingo.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.699
Guess we got something
to look forward to.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.469
Yes, we do.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.670
See you around.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.639
Not if I see you first.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.508
Good night, Lieutenant.
Good night,
Agent Brody.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.644
You ready?

36:18.677 --> 36:20.312
Always.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.614
Good. 'Cause we have
a promise to keep.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.885
(monitors beeping
quietly, steadily)

36:51.743 --> 36:53.979
I'm here, Mama.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.549
Right by your side.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.585
Gonna be okay.

37:26.378 --> 37:29.615
What do you say
we take a detour
on the way back?

37:29.648 --> 37:32.017
Get some Royal Reds and
play pool at Stillwaters?

37:33.719 --> 37:37.423
Actually, I had
something else in mind.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.496
PRIDE:
Linda, it's me.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.633
Uh...

37:47.666 --> 37:49.701
Remember that pillbox

37:49.735 --> 37:52.438
we lived in right
after we got married?

37:52.471 --> 37:53.839
The one with the leaky fridge,

37:53.872 --> 37:55.907
and we used to go up
on the rooftop and...

37:55.941 --> 37:58.276
well...
well, you-you know.

37:59.911 --> 38:03.048
Uh...

38:03.081 --> 38:05.884
I just... I-I'm willing
to go see that therapist.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.522
Just name the time
and place and...

38:10.556 --> 38:13.692
and, uh, you know,
whatever it takes to...

38:13.725 --> 38:15.727
work this out.

38:16.728 --> 38:20.332
So no more time slips by.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.571
So... call me.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.612
(Brody and Lasalle
conversing indistinctly)

38:33.645 --> 38:35.647
BRODY: I mean, how often
do you actually cook?

38:35.681 --> 38:38.384
LASALLE: I'm not a... I'm not
a boil expert, but...

38:38.417 --> 38:40.519
BRODY: You're not an
anything expert.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.688
LASALLE: How many of
these shrimp boils

38:42.721 --> 38:44.690
do you think I've done?

38:44.723 --> 38:46.425
BRODY: I know what
I'm talking about.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.494
Oh, famous last words.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.962
St. Aug Marching 100
coming over for dinner?

38:51.963 --> 38:53.965
What on earth are you two doing?

38:53.999 --> 38:56.435
Don't look at me.
It's Brody's idea.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.036
She made me drive straight back
here-- didn't even let me

38:58.069 --> 38:59.905
stop in Gulf Shores
to take a look at the view.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.940
After the couple days
that we had, can't blame

39:01.973 --> 39:03.409
a girl for wanting to get home.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.544
What's in the pot?
Shrimp boil.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.446
Thought I'd cook
you something.

39:07.479 --> 39:10.682
You know, for, uh...
for saving my butt today.

39:10.716 --> 39:11.983
Just part of the job.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.585
Maybe so.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.353
Still felt good
to know you had my back.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.459
So, anyway, like I was saying,

39:20.492 --> 39:22.060
the cayenne goes in
before the shrimp.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.562
No, no, no, no, no!
Here...

39:23.595 --> 39:24.863
It says online to add
the seasonings last.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.398
Online?
Oh, hell, no...

39:26.432 --> 39:27.933
It's a foodie blog.
Oh, for... No, n...

39:27.966 --> 39:29.134
Both of you are wrong.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.869
Foodie blog...
It all goes in

39:30.902 --> 39:32.604
at once.

39:32.638 --> 39:33.872
All right?

39:35.641 --> 39:37.643
How 'bout the two of you
call a truce...

39:39.144 --> 39:41.480
enjoy each other's
company for the evening?

39:42.781 --> 39:45.083
Hey, now I'll
drink to that.
