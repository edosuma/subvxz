-Hello!
-Hello!

03:51.599 --> 03:52.633
Mrs. Marlowe, yes?

03:53.333 --> 03:54.602
Harper, yes.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.970
Wonderful. Geoffrey.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.270
Hi.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.806
-Do come in.
-Thank you.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.309
Was it a hellish drive?

04:02.342 --> 04:04.712
-No, no, no. Not at all.
-Oh, good.

04:04.746 --> 04:06.714
The M4 can be beastly.

04:06.748 --> 04:09.016
"M4, dreadful chore."

04:09.050 --> 04:10.752
That's what we used to say.

04:10.785 --> 04:14.321
Well, it's a beautiful house.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.390
Yes, nearly 500 years old
in parts. Hmm?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.594
What a thought, eh?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.362
Shakespeare.

04:23.631 --> 04:24.832
Or pre.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.902
Uh, look, you must have bags.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.470
Sorry?

04:30.505 --> 04:32.507
Oh, you must have bags.
Boot of the car?

04:32.540 --> 04:33.574
Why don't I bring them in?

04:33.608 --> 04:34.575
I can help.

04:34.609 --> 04:36.878
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, absolutely not. No.

04:36.911 --> 04:38.679
You, uh, make yourself
comfortable.

04:38.713 --> 04:41.448
The kettle's boiled.
Kitchen just through there.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.350
Uh, tea in the cupboard,
milk in the fridge.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.986
Just where you'd expect
to find them.

04:45.019 --> 04:46.721
Great.

04:46.754 --> 04:47.755
Won't be a jiffy.

05:36.037 --> 05:37.470
Shit.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.372
Can I help?

05:39.406 --> 05:42.109
Erm, no, no.
No, no. No problem.

05:53.054 --> 05:55.923
Gosh, broken a sweat.

05:55.957 --> 05:58.593
Started to wish
I'd let you help.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.894
Still, I expect
you need it all.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.394
It's two weeks you've got
the place, isn't it?

06:01.428 --> 06:02.462
Yeah. That's right, yeah.

06:02.495 --> 06:03.898
Oh, you found the tea.
Jolly good.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.068
Apple from the garden?

06:07.101 --> 06:09.503
Yeah, it was delicious.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.906
Scrumping, eh? No, no, no, no.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.742
Mustn't do that.
Forbidden fruit.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.143
Oh. Uh...

06:16.177 --> 06:17.511
God, sorry, I... I...

06:17.545 --> 06:19.814
I'm joking.

06:19.847 --> 06:20.982
Oh.

06:21.015 --> 06:24.151
Have as many as you like.
Make chutney.

06:24.185 --> 06:25.887
They only fall to the ground
and spoil.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.855
Next thing you know,
the place is full of wasps.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.424
-Shall I show you round?
-Yeah.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.130
Uh, and let's start
with the ground floor.

06:37.932 --> 06:40.433
Drawing room.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.971
Oh, now, not the best
reception on the telly.

06:44.005 --> 06:46.607
Little bit patchy
when it's raining.

06:46.641 --> 06:48.109
Don't know why.

06:48.142 --> 06:50.177
Fireplace is good to go.

06:50.211 --> 06:51.545
Oh, and if you
run out of wood,

06:51.579 --> 06:52.980
there's stacks more
in the shed.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.951
Moving in to the piano room.

07:00.121 --> 07:01.122
Do you play the piano?

07:02.023 --> 07:03.490
Uh, no.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.660
Oh. Me neither.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.131
Now let me show you
the dining room.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.733
Good for a slap-up
Sunday roast.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.236
Uh, the cloak room. Coats,

07:15.269 --> 07:17.939
brollies, wellies,
blah, blah, blah.

07:17.972 --> 07:20.675
But, obviously, try not
to walk mud through the house.

07:21.142 --> 07:23.110
Upstairs.

07:23.144 --> 07:25.513
Up the wibbly-wobbly way.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.648
Little uneven
but hold your nerve.

07:31.986 --> 07:34.088
Clean towels, plenty of soap.

07:34.121 --> 07:38.559
And, uh, good big tub
for soaking after a long walk.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.928
Ah, only thing...
Sorry, have to say it.

07:40.962 --> 07:43.030
Uh, ladies,
do watch what you flush.

07:44.632 --> 07:45.933
Right. Yeah.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.002
Septic tank, you see.
Can't cope.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.074
Well, let's say no more.

07:55.776 --> 07:59.013
Finally, ta-da.
The master bedroom.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.715
Wow.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.550
Yeah, wonderful view,
isn't it?

08:04.652 --> 08:07.088
See the church spire
over the trees?

08:07.121 --> 08:10.691
That's the village.
A stone's throw.

08:10.725 --> 08:12.860
Jolly nice pub
if you're interested.

08:12.893 --> 08:13.928
10-minute walk there,

08:13.961 --> 08:15.796
30-minute walk back.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.732
Mm.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.235
Clean sheets and so forth.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.538
And, uh, will it just
be you staying or...

08:24.572 --> 08:25.840
Yeah, it's just me.

08:27.241 --> 08:28.275
Where's hubby?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.612
Excuse me?

08:31.645 --> 08:32.746
"Mrs. Marlowe," no?

08:33.981 --> 08:36.717
Yeah, uh, no.

08:36.751 --> 08:38.753
No, it isn't.
I haven't changed it yet,

08:38.785 --> 08:39.787
the "Mrs."

08:40.221 --> 08:41.621
Or the surname.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.092
Oh. Oh.

08:48.329 --> 08:50.698
Well done, Geoffrey.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.933
Oh, no. Please, it's fine.

08:52.967 --> 08:56.037
Wi-Fi password,
and all that mumbo jumbo

08:56.070 --> 08:58.639
is in the welcome pack
on the piano.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.875
Now, key. Key to the castle.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.943
Just the one.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.812
Don't worry if you lose it.
To be honest,

09:04.845 --> 09:05.980
you don't need to lock
your doors 'round here.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.681
Well, thanks again.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.817
The... The place is lovely.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.985
It's exactly what I hoped for.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.653
Ah. Well,
I'll leave you to it.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.359
Oh, if you need me,
you've got my number.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.628
And I live just down the lane.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.164
The cottage with
a "beware of the dog" sign.

09:23.197 --> 09:24.632
And even though
the old girl's been dead

09:24.665 --> 09:25.534
these past five years,

09:25.566 --> 09:27.768
and never said boo
to a goose.

09:27.802 --> 09:29.203
Well, thanks again.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.274
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.950
I think I might have
splashed out

09:42.983 --> 09:44.919
just a little bit too much.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.787
<i>No, it's gorgeous.</i>

09:46.821 --> 09:51.358
Yes, yes, yes. It is.
It is the dream country house.

09:51.392 --> 09:54.061
<i>Can you give me the tour?</i>
<i>I want to see all of it.</i>

09:54.095 --> 09:55.930
Uh, yeah, can I do it later?

09:55.963 --> 09:58.933
I just finished the tour
with the owner, Geoffrey.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.968
He was quite a character.

10:01.235 --> 10:02.169
<i>Go on.</i>

10:02.203 --> 10:05.239
He was a very,
very, specific type.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.176
Very, very country.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.878
<i>And will you be joining him</i>

10:10.911 --> 10:12.146
<i>grouse shooting tomorrow?</i>

10:12.179 --> 10:13.247
That's perfect.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.152
He asked about James,
actually.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.921
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>he asked about James? How?</i>

10:20.955 --> 10:24.125
I booked it
under Mrs. Marlowe.

10:24.158 --> 10:27.128
Just... strange
that I did that.

10:27.161 --> 10:28.395
Automatic, I guess.

10:28.429 --> 10:30.397
<i>So, what did you tell him?</i>

10:30.431 --> 10:31.899
I didn't tell him anything.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.970
I implied I was divorced.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.172
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:39.373 --> 10:42.243
<i>-Harper...</i>
-Stop, I know
what you're gonna say.

10:43.344 --> 10:45.679
I mean, I don't know, but...

10:45.713 --> 10:47.882
Look, this kind of thing

10:47.915 --> 10:50.151
is gonna happen
again and again.

10:50.184 --> 10:52.419
In one way, it's gonna
happen my whole life, so,

10:53.854 --> 10:55.322
I'm just gonna
have to get used to it.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.224
<i>Okay.</i>

10:58.392 --> 11:00.427
<i>But you didn't know</i>
<i>what I was gonna say.</i>

11:01.262 --> 11:02.463
<i>I was gonna say,</i>

11:02.496 --> 11:04.031
<i>did you know that elephants</i>

11:04.064 --> 11:05.733
<i>are the only animal</i>
<i>that can't jump?</i>

11:07.301 --> 11:10.871
<i>Just an interesting fact</i>
<i>that I need to share with you.</i>

11:10.905 --> 11:12.473
That is very interesting.

11:12.507 --> 11:14.441
<i>Yeah, and it's...</i>

11:18.979 --> 11:22.116
<i>...elephant dressage events</i>
<i>never really took off.</i>

11:24.785 --> 11:26.820
<i>Sorry. Lame.</i>

11:26.854 --> 11:29.757
No, no. No. No, no, sorry,
just the signal cut out.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.159
<i>Fucking typical.</i>
<i>I was being hilarious.</i>

11:34.028 --> 11:35.829
-Um...
<i>-So, yeah, I'll...</i>

11:35.863 --> 11:37.298
<i>-I'll see you later.</i>
-Yeah, yeah. You bet.

11:37.331 --> 11:38.832
-All right. Love you.
<i>-Bye, love you.</i>

11:38.866 --> 11:40.034
-Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

12:07.962 --> 12:09.296
<i>You're not divorcing me.</i>

12:11.799 --> 12:13.834
You're divorcing how...

12:13.867 --> 12:15.836
how I've been for...
for the past year.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.471
I get that, but once...
once I've...

12:17.505 --> 12:18.839
James.

12:24.011 --> 12:27.047
We... We made
promises, Harper.

12:27.081 --> 12:28.382
In a church.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.085
What promises did we make?

12:31.118 --> 12:32.786
If I can know
why you married me,

12:32.820 --> 12:34.822
then I can subtract
what's different about me now.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.056
-James.
-Yes?

12:36.090 --> 12:37.124
Please.

12:42.830 --> 12:43.998
I'll kill myself.

12:49.837 --> 12:50.871
No, you can't...

12:50.904 --> 12:52.339
You can't say
something like that.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.544
-You can't say that to me!
-I'm saying it.

12:57.278 --> 12:58.946
I say it

12:58.979 --> 13:01.181
because you will have
to live with it.

13:02.283 --> 13:03.384
On your conscience.

13:04.586 --> 13:05.754
No.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.056
No, James! Just, please...

13:09.089 --> 13:12.893
Stop
saying please, Harper!

13:12.926 --> 13:15.129
Stop pleading! I am pleading!

13:16.297 --> 13:17.865
I am!

13:19.534 --> 13:22.136
Now, I am sorry you will have
to live with my death

13:22.169 --> 13:24.104
on your conscience,
but it's the truth.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.974
You can't give this to me.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.075
It'll be as if
you'd killed me yourself.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.144
You can't say this.
You can't do that. No, James.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.879
No, it'll be
as if you killed yourself,

13:31.912 --> 13:34.315
and would be
fucking unbearable.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.183
That is the last thing
I would ever, ever want.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.351
This isn't... It's not.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.554
It's not the last thing
because you wanna divorce me.

13:39.587 --> 13:41.388
That's so...

13:41.422 --> 13:43.257
-That's so fucking crazy!
-You wanna divorce me

13:43.290 --> 13:44.491
more than you wanna
keep me alive!

13:44.526 --> 13:45.993
Can't you hear
what you're saying?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.328
How is my life
worth so little to you?

13:47.361 --> 13:49.463
Because I have a life, too!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.498
I have a fucking life!

13:52.534 --> 13:53.635
You are threatening me.

13:53.668 --> 13:54.902
-I'm not threatening you.
-You are...

13:54.935 --> 13:56.136
It's not a threat.
It's a warning.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.104
You're fucking threatening me,

13:57.137 --> 13:58.272
-and it's fucking horrible.
-It's a fact.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.240
It tears me apart!

14:00.274 --> 14:02.209
But when you threaten me
into not divorcing you,

14:02.242 --> 14:05.412
that is exactly why
we have to get divorced.

14:05.446 --> 14:09.450
And I am going to divorce you,
okay? I am. I am.

14:10.652 --> 14:12.953
Because I can't live like...

14:12.986 --> 14:14.121
I can't live...

18:54.669 --> 18:55.670
Ahh!

19:15.823 --> 19:17.224
Ah, ah!

20:12.547 --> 20:14.481
<i>♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪</i>

20:35.636 --> 20:37.437
<i>♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪</i>

20:49.550 --> 20:51.018
<i>♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪</i>

21:01.796 --> 21:04.866
<i>♪ Ah! ♪</i>

24:25.900 --> 24:27.535
Oh.

26:18.879 --> 26:20.014
Fuck.

30:49.283 --> 30:50.884
Fuck.

31:24.985 --> 31:26.286
Hey.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.187
Yeah, good.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.456
Um, I'm just going
through the figures

31:29.490 --> 31:30.924
you just sent over.

31:31.659 --> 31:32.727
The revisions, yeah.

31:32.761 --> 31:34.596
I just wanted to double-check
a couple of things.

31:41.034 --> 31:43.237
Yeah, uh, but, sorry,
we can't offer them that deal

31:43.270 --> 31:45.640
if the figures are correct.
Our margins disappear.

31:48.475 --> 31:49.476
Margins.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.112
Yeah. Uh-huh.

32:06.193 --> 32:08.630
Okay. Call the suppliers
and check.

32:09.430 --> 32:10.431
Bye.

32:23.410 --> 32:25.245
- Hey!
<i>- Hi.</i>

32:25.279 --> 32:27.047
<i>I'm ready for that tour</i>
<i>your promised me.</i>

32:27.414 --> 32:28.415
Now?

32:29.416 --> 32:30.518
<i>Yeah, it's perfect timing.</i>

32:30.552 --> 32:32.986
-Who for?
<i>-Come on, Harper!</i>

32:33.020 --> 32:34.388
Okay. Okay.

32:34.421 --> 32:37.991
This place is pretty cool.

32:39.059 --> 32:40.994
So, here's the garden.

32:41.395 --> 32:42.664
<i>Oh!</i>

32:42.697 --> 32:44.732
Conservatory.

32:45.365 --> 32:46.500
<i>Love it!</i>

32:46.534 --> 32:48.302
And...

32:50.103 --> 32:51.639
the kitchen.

32:51.673 --> 32:53.541
<i>Red walls, that's bold.</i>

32:53.575 --> 32:56.109
-Very.
<i>-Yeah, it works.</i>

32:56.143 --> 32:58.278
<i>Shaker, ugh!</i>

32:58.312 --> 32:59.346
<i>AGA!</i>

32:59.379 --> 33:01.315
I know.

33:01.348 --> 33:04.586
And moving ever so gently

33:04.619 --> 33:07.087
into the east wing.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.523
You'll notice
the beautiful patina

33:08.556 --> 33:10.057
on the flagstone floor

33:10.090 --> 33:12.125
<i>-Mm.</i>
-Mm!

33:12.159 --> 33:14.796
-Low oak beams.
<i>-Of course.</i>

33:14.829 --> 33:19.333
And here we have a generously
proportioned living room.

33:19.366 --> 33:22.035
Open wood fire.

33:22.069 --> 33:24.338
-Comfortable sofas.
<i>-Uh!</i>

33:24.371 --> 33:25.807
And a baby grand.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.374
<i>Wow!</i>

33:27.407 --> 33:30.377
<i>-Do you play piano?</i>
-I do, actually.

33:30.410 --> 33:32.479
<i>Love that wallpaper.</i>

33:32.514 --> 33:34.281
<i>-Those windows!</i>
-Ugh, sunlit aspect.

33:34.314 --> 33:36.250
And look,
check out the view of the...

33:40.387 --> 33:42.189
I'll call you back.

33:42.222 --> 33:43.323
<i>What...</i>

33:58.171 --> 33:59.273
<i>999,</i>

33:59.306 --> 34:00.575
<i>which service do you require?</i>

34:00.608 --> 34:01.676
Police.

34:01.709 --> 34:03.310
<i>Please explain the reason</i>
<i>for calling.</i>

34:03.343 --> 34:06.246
There's an intruder
in my garden. Um, a man.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.682
He isn't wearing any clothes,

34:07.715 --> 34:09.717
and I think
he might be stalking me.

34:09.751 --> 34:11.753
<i>Can you give me your address?</i>

34:14.589 --> 34:15.757
It's a village. Cotson.

34:15.790 --> 34:18.458
Uh, C-O-T-S-O...

34:19.293 --> 34:20.594
<i>Herefordshire?</i>

34:23.429 --> 34:24.666
-Yeah.
<i>-Okay.</i>

34:24.699 --> 34:27.400
<i>Does the house have</i>
<i>any distinguishing features?</i>

34:28.636 --> 34:30.203
Features? Um...

34:31.739 --> 34:33.775
Uh, my, uh... My car.

34:33.808 --> 34:35.208
My car's parked outside.

34:35.242 --> 34:40.280
It's a blue Ford Fiesta.
Registration CK61 LZF.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.722
<i>Explain what's happening,</i>
<i>please.</i>

34:52.893 --> 34:54.829
<i>Can you explain</i>
<i>what's happening, please?</i>

35:04.706 --> 35:06.340
<i>A police car</i>
<i>has been dispatched.</i>

35:06.373 --> 35:07.609
<i>Please stay on the line.</i>

35:07.642 --> 35:08.776
I am staying on the line.

35:08.810 --> 35:10.477
<i>Are you alone in the house?</i>

35:13.781 --> 35:16.216
-He's trying to get in.
<i>-Police are on their way.</i>

35:16.249 --> 35:18.786
<i>There's a car in your area.</i>
<i>It will be with you soon.</i>

35:46.614 --> 35:47.849
I'm scaring you?

35:49.249 --> 35:50.652
Yeah, you are.

35:52.486 --> 35:53.655
You're scaring me.

35:54.822 --> 35:56.456
How do you not
understand that?

35:56.490 --> 35:58.826
How do you make yourself
into the fucking victim?

35:58.860 --> 36:00.360
-You scare me.
-James.

36:00.394 --> 36:02.429
Look,
I don't want either of us

36:02.462 --> 36:03.898
to be scared of the other.

36:03.931 --> 36:06.233
Well, what... What, you're
saying I do want that?

36:06.266 --> 36:07.467
No, I'm not saying that.

36:07.501 --> 36:09.403
No, no. What does this say?

36:12.507 --> 36:14.742
It says,
"He's really scaring me."

36:18.245 --> 36:19.781
What've you said
to that bitch, Riley?

36:19.814 --> 36:20.848
Nothing.

36:21.949 --> 36:22.984
-Unlock it.
-No.

36:23.017 --> 36:24.351
-Unlock it.
-No.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.888
What are you trying
to hide from me?

36:29.256 --> 36:30.323
It's my phone.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.443
Okay, let's get him up.

36:50.678 --> 36:51.879
Come on then, my friend.

36:53.380 --> 36:55.016
So you don't know who he is?

36:55.049 --> 36:58.786
Well, he wasn't carrying
any ID, that's for sure.

36:58.820 --> 37:00.621
Looks like
he's been sleeping rough.

37:01.989 --> 37:03.624
I saw him yesterday.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.562
Well...

37:07.595 --> 37:08.763
I know, I... I think...

37:08.796 --> 37:10.631
I think he followed me
out of the woods.

37:11.032 --> 37:12.533
Which woods?

37:12.567 --> 37:13.835
Oh, God,
I don't know the area.

37:13.868 --> 37:14.836
I was on a walk.

37:14.869 --> 37:17.538
Erm, it was the forest
just over the fields.

37:17.572 --> 37:20.641
Mm, Cotson Woods,
the old railway line.

37:20.675 --> 37:22.944
Yeah, that's probably
where he was sleeping.

37:27.782 --> 37:29.517
Look, it must've been
very frightening.

37:29.550 --> 37:31.052
I do understand.

37:31.085 --> 37:32.452
But honestly,

37:33.353 --> 37:34.956
I think he's harmless.

37:34.989 --> 37:36.891
He didn't resist at all.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.860
Seemed a bit confused,
bit of a nut, you know.

37:38.893 --> 37:40.828
Right, yeah.

37:40.862 --> 37:42.429
He stinks to high heaven,
though.

37:42.462 --> 37:44.297
That man is definitely
in need of a wash.

37:44.331 --> 37:46.399
I'm not looking forward
to driving him to the station.

37:46.433 --> 37:48.836
Well, I'm just glad
you were nearby.

37:49.537 --> 37:51.038
Me, too.

37:51.072 --> 37:52.840
Oh, no.
They came really quickly.

37:52.874 --> 37:54.307
Which is bloody lucky

37:54.341 --> 37:55.643
'cause I bet
their response time

37:55.676 --> 37:57.477
can be really slow out here.

38:00.114 --> 38:01.448
<i>Will you</i>
<i>please let me come up?</i>

38:01.481 --> 38:02.482
No.

38:03.483 --> 38:04.886
<i>Harper, for fuck's sake.</i>

38:04.919 --> 38:07.522
Oh, for fuck's sake yourself.

38:07.555 --> 38:10.390
I didn't come here
to be afraid, Riley.

38:10.423 --> 38:11.726
<i>What are you trying to prove?</i>

38:12.660 --> 38:13.928
<i>This isn't about being weak.</i>

38:13.961 --> 38:15.897
Yeah, it isn't.

38:17.464 --> 38:19.734
It was just some weirdo, okay?

38:19.767 --> 38:21.068
And the police said
he wasn't dangerous,

38:21.102 --> 38:23.504
and they've got him
now anyway, so...

38:23.538 --> 38:24.605
End of story.

38:26.607 --> 38:28.643
Look, it's a quiet,
pretty village

38:28.676 --> 38:31.879
in beautiful countryside.

38:31.913 --> 38:33.080
I'm gonna do a bit more work,

38:33.114 --> 38:35.016
and then I'm gonna have
a wander around.

38:35.049 --> 38:36.851
There's an old church nearby,

38:36.884 --> 38:38.586
and, apparently,
the pub's nice, so...

38:44.792 --> 38:46.093
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Okay.

40:59.694 --> 41:00.962
What was that, James?

41:02.897 --> 41:04.532
Your plan to win me back?

41:06.667 --> 41:07.768
Harper...

41:07.802 --> 41:09.136
Get out.

41:10.304 --> 41:11.539
Get out.

41:11.572 --> 41:13.641
I'm... I'm sorry, please.

41:15.042 --> 41:17.511
Get out! Get out!

41:17.545 --> 41:19.280
-Harper, I...
-Get out!

41:19.313 --> 41:21.115
Get out!

41:21.849 --> 41:22.883
I'm sorry!

41:22.917 --> 41:25.720
No! You want
to fucking apologize?

41:25.753 --> 41:27.688
After threatening
to kill yourself?

41:27.722 --> 41:29.657
Don't bother,
I don't give a fuck!

41:29.690 --> 41:30.558
It'll make no difference,

41:30.591 --> 41:32.626
because whatever you say,
whatever you do,

41:32.660 --> 41:34.795
you will never,
ever see me again.

41:34.829 --> 41:37.231
Now get the fuck out!

43:06.120 --> 43:07.154
Hello.

43:09.690 --> 43:10.691
Who are you?

43:11.392 --> 43:12.626
Uh...

43:12.660 --> 43:13.694
I'm Harper.

43:18.833 --> 43:19.900
Wanna play a game?

43:23.003 --> 43:24.004
Hide and seek?

43:25.306 --> 43:27.007
You hide. I'll seek.

43:29.176 --> 43:30.878
I... I... I don't think I can.

43:32.847 --> 43:33.848
You can't hide?

43:35.416 --> 43:36.917
Go on.

43:36.951 --> 43:38.319
I bet you're good at it.

43:38.352 --> 43:39.353
And I'm good at seeking.

43:39.386 --> 43:41.388
I'm just not in the mood
to play a game right now.

43:42.189 --> 43:43.190
Sorry.

43:44.091 --> 43:46.660
Samuel. Go home.

43:46.694 --> 43:48.229
Leave the lady alone.

43:48.262 --> 43:50.197
No. I want to play a game
with her.

43:50.231 --> 43:51.699
She's told you
perfectly clearly

43:51.732 --> 43:53.901
she doesn't feel like it.

43:53.934 --> 43:55.269
Perhaps she will later,
but not right now.

43:56.737 --> 43:57.938
Why don't you fuck off?

43:59.773 --> 44:00.841
You first.

44:13.754 --> 44:14.855
Stupid bitch.

44:18.225 --> 44:19.326
I do apologize.

44:20.794 --> 44:22.930
Samuel is
a deeply troubled boy.

44:22.963 --> 44:23.998
I live in London,

44:24.031 --> 44:25.766
I'm used to kids
swearing at me.

44:27.468 --> 44:30.237
Not so used to them swearing
at vicars, but...

44:31.739 --> 44:33.140
Yes, but, um...

44:35.042 --> 44:36.076
Just one thing. Do you mind?

44:36.777 --> 44:37.778
No.

44:38.312 --> 44:39.947
You're in pain, yes?

44:40.814 --> 44:41.949
Sorry?

44:41.982 --> 44:43.384
I noticed you just now,
in the church,

44:43.417 --> 44:44.785
sitting in the pews.

44:46.287 --> 44:48.255
And...

44:48.289 --> 44:49.723
At first,
I thought you were praying,

44:49.757 --> 44:51.325
but then I realized
you weren't praying.

44:53.260 --> 44:54.261
You're tormented.

44:56.864 --> 44:59.333
I didn't approach,
but of course, I should have.

44:59.366 --> 45:00.401
So...

45:01.268 --> 45:02.269
I am now.

45:04.972 --> 45:06.240
Do you think I could help?

45:10.044 --> 45:11.712
I don't know if I'm...

45:13.814 --> 45:16.183
tormented, exactly, but...

45:16.951 --> 45:17.985
But?

45:18.018 --> 45:19.420
It feels more like...

45:22.489 --> 45:23.891
Haunted?

45:25.492 --> 45:26.493
Yeah.

45:32.433 --> 45:33.500
Let's sit a while.

45:38.573 --> 45:40.741
I'd had a row with my husband.

45:42.009 --> 45:44.144
We were separating, and...

45:46.380 --> 45:47.481
But this was...

45:49.116 --> 45:50.851
This was by far the worst.

45:56.824 --> 45:58.259
And something happened.

46:00.327 --> 46:01.529
He hit me.

46:07.468 --> 46:10.371
He'd never done that before.

46:10.404 --> 46:14.441
I... I... I screamed at him,
I was so angry.

46:15.577 --> 46:17.244
I made him leave,
threw him out,

46:17.278 --> 46:19.346
locked the door.
Wouldn't let him back in.

46:22.182 --> 46:23.450
Then, apparently,
what happened next

46:23.484 --> 46:27.054
was he pushed his away
into the flat upstairs,

46:27.087 --> 46:29.990
went to their balcony,
tried to climb down to ours,

46:30.024 --> 46:31.125
but he...

46:32.393 --> 46:35.129
he slipped. Or...

46:41.502 --> 46:43.971
Or let himself go.

46:48.175 --> 46:49.577
I honestly don't know.

46:53.347 --> 46:55.949
As he fell past,

46:55.983 --> 46:57.818
I was looking out.

46:59.253 --> 47:00.555
And he was looking in.

47:05.359 --> 47:07.394
And it felt like
we could see each other.

47:10.397 --> 47:11.465
Well...

47:14.001 --> 47:15.903
Well, I'm not even sure
if that's possible.

47:19.173 --> 47:20.341
Could he see me?

47:21.576 --> 47:22.644
As he fell?

47:22.677 --> 47:24.546
It happened so quickly,

47:24.579 --> 47:26.614
but I think he did.

47:28.516 --> 47:30.451
And that's what haunts me.

47:35.189 --> 47:36.223
I see.

47:40.260 --> 47:41.529
If I may...

47:44.164 --> 47:45.332
I think

47:46.400 --> 47:48.035
you need to be understood.

47:49.269 --> 47:50.938
And I do understand.

47:53.407 --> 47:55.943
I can fully imagine
it must be dreadful for you.

47:59.380 --> 48:01.281
And, inevitably,

48:01.315 --> 48:03.283
you also feel
an awful sense of...

48:04.686 --> 48:06.253
of guilt.

48:07.555 --> 48:09.256
And that haunts you, too.

48:12.326 --> 48:15.929
The seared snapshot image.

48:17.364 --> 48:19.701
Why, yes, you carry it. You...

48:19.734 --> 48:22.236
You see it when you close
your eyes, but...

48:23.270 --> 48:25.406
Also, you ask
yourself repeatedly,

48:27.040 --> 48:28.242
"What if?"

48:29.443 --> 48:30.978
"If only."

48:33.480 --> 48:34.948
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

48:50.698 --> 48:52.266
It's the screaming.

48:58.540 --> 49:00.340
I think he wasn't screaming.

49:01.408 --> 49:03.043
No, yours.

49:10.117 --> 49:12.219
You must wonder
why you drove him to it?

49:16.190 --> 49:18.392
What?
I didn't drive him to it.

49:22.697 --> 49:23.731
Well,

49:26.768 --> 49:28.101
after he struck you,

49:28.135 --> 49:30.404
did you give him a chance
to apologize?

49:32.105 --> 49:34.709
What?

49:34.742 --> 49:36.243
Did... Did you?

49:39.346 --> 49:40.782
No. I... I...

49:40.815 --> 49:43.518
Men do strike women sometimes.

49:43.551 --> 49:45.720
It's not nice, but it's not
a capital offense.

49:48.255 --> 49:49.189
What?

49:49.223 --> 49:52.259
You prefer things
to be comfortable or true?

49:54.629 --> 49:56.531
Might it be true

49:56.564 --> 49:59.132
that if you'd given him
the chance to apologize,

49:59.166 --> 50:00.467
he'd still be alive?

50:04.137 --> 50:05.239
Fuck off.

50:09.611 --> 50:10.745
Aren't these the questions
you asked?

50:10.778 --> 50:12.212
Fuck off!

52:33.721 --> 52:34.722
"P-O"...

52:36.423 --> 52:38.225
"P-O" something, something.

52:40.360 --> 52:43.463
"G," come on, Geoffrey,
fire up the engines.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.736
Ah! Pomegranate. Very good.

52:58.311 --> 52:59.681
Ah! Mrs... Ms...

52:59.714 --> 53:02.249
Ms. Marlowe.

53:02.282 --> 53:03.918
Come to paint
the village red, eh?

53:03.951 --> 53:05.419
I just want a drink.

53:05.452 --> 53:06.921
Yeah, I know the feeling well.

53:08.956 --> 53:10.625
What'll it be, Miss?

53:10.658 --> 53:11.959
Um, vodka tonic.

53:11.993 --> 53:13.561
-On its way.
-Oh, hey, let me get it.

53:13.594 --> 53:14.494
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

53:14.529 --> 53:15.830
-Absolutely not. My shout.
-I've got it.

53:15.863 --> 53:16.698
I've got it. Oh, please.

53:16.731 --> 53:18.599
Franklin, her money's
no good here.

53:18.633 --> 53:19.734
Right you are.

53:19.767 --> 53:22.570
It seems that you don't
have legal tender.

53:23.403 --> 53:24.404
Thank you.

53:25.439 --> 53:26.574
Just, um, chalk it up.

53:29.711 --> 53:31.378
Settled in okay? No gremlins?

53:32.947 --> 53:35.616
I saw you at the church
a little while ago.

53:35.650 --> 53:37.350
You found
the stained glass window?

53:37.384 --> 53:38.653
You know, at dawn,

53:38.686 --> 53:39.921
the sun shines
straight through it.

53:40.788 --> 53:42.456
It's... It's miraculous.

53:43.558 --> 53:44.959
You'd be bathed in light.

53:46.561 --> 53:47.662
Been for a walk yet?

53:48.963 --> 53:50.497
The old railway line.

53:50.531 --> 53:52.432
You can stand there
and imagine the steam trains

53:52.466 --> 53:53.534
-as they...
-Oi to the oi.

53:53.568 --> 53:55.970
- ...pass through the woods.
- Hello, Jimmy.

53:56.003 --> 53:57.270
Frank. Geoff.

53:57.304 --> 53:58.405
-Pint?
-Of course.

53:59.674 --> 54:01.374
Evening, ma'am.

54:01.408 --> 54:03.443
I hope you're
feeling okay now.

54:03.477 --> 54:06.013
-Not too rattled.
-Mm, fine. Thanks.

54:06.047 --> 54:07.682
You heard about that business
at your rental?

54:07.715 --> 54:08.983
My rental? What business?

54:09.016 --> 54:11.052
Yeah.
Intruder on the property.

54:11.085 --> 54:12.452
Or on the grounds, anyway.

54:12.486 --> 54:13.621
Well, surely not.

54:14.756 --> 54:16.758
Some bloke, not a stitch
of clothing on him.

54:16.791 --> 54:17.992
Goodness me.

54:18.025 --> 54:20.027
When the cat's away,
eh?

54:20.061 --> 54:21.261
No.

54:21.863 --> 54:22.897
No.

54:22.930 --> 54:24.732
Was a care
of the community type.

54:24.766 --> 54:26.067
Starkers and bonkers, eh?

54:26.100 --> 54:28.401
That's him. Sounds like
you know the guy, Geoff.

54:28.435 --> 54:30.805
- Oh, stop it.
- Did you find out who he is?

54:30.838 --> 54:32.540
Oh, some gyppo, I dare say.

54:33.007 --> 54:34.341
Maybe.

54:34.374 --> 54:36.844
I'm so sorry, Ms. Marlowe.

54:36.878 --> 54:38.411
No, it's not your fault,
Geoffrey.

54:38.445 --> 54:39.647
No, it must've been awful
for you.

54:39.680 --> 54:40.715
It was.

54:41.649 --> 54:43.518
But they have him now, so...

54:43.551 --> 54:44.752
Had him.

54:44.786 --> 54:46.754
Had to release the bugger
about an hour ago.

54:48.022 --> 54:49.356
What?

54:50.792 --> 54:52.093
You released him?

54:52.126 --> 54:54.061
Yeah. Yeah, had to let him go.

54:54.095 --> 54:55.295
Why?

54:56.264 --> 54:58.465
Not much to charge him with,
Miss.

54:59.466 --> 55:01.102
It's not like
he stole anything.

55:01.135 --> 55:02.435
Just one
of your apples, Geoff.

55:02.469 --> 55:04.404
Scrumping! Hang him!

55:04.437 --> 55:05.807
Yeah, we gave him

55:05.840 --> 55:07.675
a jacket and trousers
from lost property.

55:07.708 --> 55:10.511
-Sent him packing.
-He was stalking me.

55:11.411 --> 55:12.445
What makes you say that?

55:12.479 --> 55:13.781
I saw him twice.

55:14.481 --> 55:15.683
You saw him twice.

55:17.919 --> 55:19.787
But I don't know
if he saw you once. It's...

55:20.822 --> 55:21.923
It's not quite stalking,
is it?

55:21.956 --> 55:24.091
He followed me
out of the woods,

55:24.125 --> 55:25.893
then tried
to break into the house.

55:28.428 --> 55:29.897
Well,

55:29.931 --> 55:31.532
you see him again,
give us a shout.

55:39.439 --> 55:40.440
You're leaving?

55:42.442 --> 55:43.778
Fucking wankers.

57:17.071 --> 57:18.606
Come on, please pick up.

57:19.874 --> 57:21.175
Come on.

57:22.910 --> 57:24.745
<i>-Don't tell me there's more.</i>
-There's more.

57:25.513 --> 57:26.580
<i>What the fuck?</i>

57:26.614 --> 57:27.648
I went for a walk.

57:27.682 --> 57:28.716
I meet a boy in a churchyard

57:28.749 --> 57:30.918
who tells me
I'm a stupid bitch.

57:30.952 --> 57:33.254
Then I meet Vicar who tells me

57:33.287 --> 57:35.957
that I drove James
to kill himself.

57:35.990 --> 57:37.558
Then I meet a policeman
who tells me

57:37.591 --> 57:38.926
that they just released
the naked weirdo

57:38.960 --> 57:41.128
who tried to break
into the house yesterday.

57:41.162 --> 57:42.163
And...

57:43.097 --> 57:46.801
I'm... I'm done. I'm done.

57:46.834 --> 57:49.637
I'm just gonna get in the car
and go home.

57:50.705 --> 57:51.739
<i>Fuck this.</i>

57:51.772 --> 57:53.074
-Yeah.
<i>-No.</i>

57:53.107 --> 57:56.110
<i>Fuck this. Fuck this shit.</i>

57:56.143 --> 57:59.046
<i>That house was the one thing</i>
<i>that you wanted for yourself.</i>

57:59.080 --> 58:01.782
<i>What you chose</i>
<i>as a place to heal.</i>

58:01.816 --> 58:02.783
<i>And now you have to give it up</i>

58:02.817 --> 58:04.986
<i>because of</i>
<i>some motherfucking nut!</i>

58:06.120 --> 58:07.621
<i>How long did you say</i>
<i>the drive was?</i>

58:07.655 --> 58:08.656
<i>Three hours away?</i>

58:10.758 --> 58:12.159
Four.

58:12.193 --> 58:13.527
<i>I'm gonna do it in three.</i>

58:13.561 --> 58:16.230
<i>And you and me, we're gonna</i>
<i>have a good fucking time.</i>

58:16.263 --> 58:17.898
<i>We are.</i>

58:17.932 --> 58:19.200
<i>We're gonna go on walks,</i>

58:19.233 --> 58:21.268
<i>and we're gonna eat</i>
<i>roast dinners.</i>

58:21.302 --> 58:22.570
<i>And ice cream,</i>

58:22.603 --> 58:26.073
<i>and I'm gonna watch you</i>
<i>get pissed in the evenings,</i>

58:26.107 --> 58:30.811
<i>and if that fucking weirdo</i>
<i>comes back,</i>

58:30.845 --> 58:32.980
<i>I'm gonna take that ax</i>
<i>and chop his dick off,</i>

58:33.014 --> 58:34.582
<i>and he can</i>
<i>fucking choke on it.</i>

58:35.116 --> 58:36.250
What ax?

58:37.018 --> 58:38.152
<i>Behind you.</i>

58:39.887 --> 58:41.188
<i>So, do we do it?</i>

58:41.222 --> 58:43.758
<i>Just five minutes for me</i>
<i>to stick some shit in a bag,</i>

58:43.791 --> 58:45.926
<i>and I'll rag it up</i>
<i>the motorway.</i>

58:47.628 --> 58:49.063
Okay.

58:49.096 --> 58:50.531
<i>So, what's the address?</i>

58:52.066 --> 58:53.968
Uh, hang on a second.

58:56.337 --> 58:57.805
Okay.

59:02.043 --> 59:04.245
Just a minute.

59:04.278 --> 59:06.013
-Have you got a pen?
<i>-Yes.</i>

59:06.047 --> 59:09.016
Okay, the village
is called Cotson.

59:09.050 --> 59:16.023
And the postcode, uh...
The postcode is HL89 3XR.

59:17.058 --> 59:18.692
The house is called
Cotson Manor.

59:18.726 --> 59:20.895
Shit.

59:24.065 --> 59:26.167
Come on.

59:29.036 --> 59:30.304
-Oh, hi.
<i>-Hi. Hi.</i>

59:30.337 --> 59:32.073
-Did you get any of that?
<i>-No.</i>

59:33.307 --> 59:36.077
Okay, the village
is called Cotson.

59:36.110 --> 59:37.978
C-O-T-S-O-N.

59:38.012 --> 59:41.248
And the postcode is HL89...

59:55.796 --> 59:56.797
Right.

01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:04.265
What is it? What's happened?

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:10.671
What are you doing here?

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.341
Has he come back?

01:01:18.245 --> 01:01:19.680
Why aren't you replying?

01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:25.119
What the fuck?

01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:55.015
Why are you...

01:01:56.884 --> 01:01:58.752
Why are you doing this?

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:39.086
I have a weapon!

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.623
I said I have a weapon!

01:03:41.656 --> 01:03:43.390
If you come in here,
I'm going to use it!

01:03:45.527 --> 01:03:48.062
Ms. Marlowe, what on earth
are you talking about?

01:03:48.663 --> 01:03:49.897
Geoff...

01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:53.033
What the hell is going on?

01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:55.402
I heard screaming,
and then a window break.

01:03:57.037 --> 01:03:59.273
There... There was someone.

01:04:00.307 --> 01:04:02.209
Someone tried to break in.

01:04:02.242 --> 01:04:04.244
Was it that bloody man?
Has he come back?

01:04:04.278 --> 01:04:05.613
No. Don't!

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:18.025
Oh, God!

01:04:23.698 --> 01:04:25.165
Oh, you poor thing.

01:04:30.471 --> 01:04:32.139
Oh, so sorry, old girl.

01:04:33.273 --> 01:04:35.008
Oh, don't look Ms. Marlowe.

01:04:38.513 --> 01:04:40.582
Sorry about that.

01:04:42.015 --> 01:04:44.952
The broken wing, you see.
Nothing to be done.

01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:47.522
But I quite understand
why it gave you a fright.

01:04:49.189 --> 01:04:50.424
But there was someone outside.

01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:54.995
He tried to get in,
tried to kick the door in.

01:04:55.028 --> 01:04:56.897
-Who?
-The policeman.

01:04:57.665 --> 01:05:00.100
-What?
-I saw the policeman.

01:05:00.134 --> 01:05:01.468
And another man.

01:05:02.503 --> 01:05:05.172
I'm not making this up.

01:05:05.205 --> 01:05:08.075
Ms. Marlowe,
you don't strike me as a liar.

01:05:08.108 --> 01:05:09.109
I believe you.

01:05:09.143 --> 01:05:11.579
After all, it's already
happened once today, no?

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:15.282
And, uh...

01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:19.253
Well, as your landlord,
it now falls on me

01:05:19.286 --> 01:05:20.354
to have a...

01:05:21.321 --> 01:05:22.356
a good look around.

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:24.458
Clear all of this up.

01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:26.460
No, Geoffrey,
don't go outside.

01:05:26.493 --> 01:05:28.328
No, nonsense.

01:05:28.362 --> 01:05:30.264
Damsel in distress,
I'm just the fellow.

01:05:30.297 --> 01:05:31.498
Geoffrey, don't!

01:05:35.436 --> 01:05:37.171
"You have precisely
the qualities

01:05:37.204 --> 01:05:39.006
"of a failed military man."

01:05:40.708 --> 01:05:42.109
What?

01:05:42.142 --> 01:05:43.310
Father told me that.

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:47.181
I was only seven years old.

01:05:48.315 --> 01:05:49.517
Time we showed him
what's what, eh?

01:06:00.762 --> 01:06:02.095
Geoffrey?

01:06:05.098 --> 01:06:06.133
That's better.

01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:11.706
All clear here.

01:06:40.501 --> 01:06:41.603
Now, look here!

01:06:43.505 --> 01:06:45.205
Whoever's out there,

01:06:45.239 --> 01:06:47.140
I don't know what you think
you're playing at, but...

01:06:48.175 --> 01:06:49.677
it's not gonna sit well
with me.

01:06:51.345 --> 01:06:52.446
Not one bit.

01:06:54.414 --> 01:06:55.583
Do you hear?

01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:03.791
Seems to me
like they might've gone.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.968
You really hurt me.

01:13:00.915 --> 01:13:02.083
Look what you did.

01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:05.720
Stay away from me.

01:13:07.588 --> 01:13:08.723
What are you gonna do now?

01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:11.125
Hurt me again?

01:13:11.893 --> 01:13:12.960
Stab me again?

01:13:14.595 --> 01:13:16.697
You're so mean.

01:13:16.731 --> 01:13:18.699
You wouldn't even play a game
of hide and seek.

01:13:20.601 --> 01:13:23.470
But I think you will now.

01:13:24.672 --> 01:13:27.074
I will fucking cut you.

01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:36.117
I'll do it.

01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:38.552
I don't think you will.

01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:57.204
But you probably should.

01:13:59.073 --> 01:14:00.741
It'll be the last chance
you get.

01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:07.848
Good, so you're hiding.

01:14:08.749 --> 01:14:09.984
I'll count to ten.

01:14:11.118 --> 01:14:12.153
One,

01:14:13.788 --> 01:14:14.789
two...

01:14:17.558 --> 01:14:18.592
three...

01:14:20.061 --> 01:14:21.095
four...

01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:22.596
You should be finding
somewhere to hide,

01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:23.698
I know where you are.

01:14:23.731 --> 01:14:24.732
...five,

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.201
six,

01:14:28.936 --> 01:14:30.037
seven,

01:14:31.806 --> 01:14:32.840
eight,

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:35.876
nine,

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.014
ten.

01:14:44.051 --> 01:14:46.187
Ready or not, here I come.

01:16:05.699 --> 01:16:07.201
"A shudder in the loins

01:16:07.968 --> 01:16:09.603
"engenders there

01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:12.139
"The broken wall,

01:16:13.174 --> 01:16:15.242
"the burning roof and tower

01:16:17.912 --> 01:16:19.146
"And Agamemnon

01:16:22.016 --> 01:16:23.117
"dead."

01:16:53.814 --> 01:16:55.382
What the fuck are you?

01:17:02.089 --> 01:17:03.257
A swan.

01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:17.638
When did you
lose your virginity?

01:17:22.476 --> 01:17:24.211
What?

01:17:24.245 --> 01:17:28.015
I'm asking you at what age
you lost your virginity.

01:17:32.419 --> 01:17:34.121
I've been thinking about it.

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:37.691
I have pictured you.

01:17:39.793 --> 01:17:41.128
Legs open.

01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:44.798
Vagina open.

01:17:48.035 --> 01:17:49.203
Mouth open.

01:17:51.739 --> 01:17:56.710
I have decided that you are
an expert in carnality.

01:17:59.146 --> 01:18:02.383
Someone who has explored

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:04.718
all the things
that they can do,

01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:08.088
and have done to them.

01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:18.399
These things now exist
in my mind.

01:18:21.802 --> 01:18:24.071
This is your power.

01:18:26.106 --> 01:18:29.243
This is the control
that you exert.

01:18:38.319 --> 01:18:41.255
"I must be won,
that cannot win,

01:18:43.357 --> 01:18:45.426
"Yet lost were I not won,

01:18:47.127 --> 01:18:51.065
"For beauty hath been created
to undo...

01:18:55.402 --> 01:18:56.971
"or be undone."

01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:10.818
You are singing to me.

01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:18.259
Not as Ulysses but as sailor.

01:19:22.329 --> 01:19:24.031
To dash me to pieces

01:19:27.835 --> 01:19:29.036
on the rocks of this...

01:19:32.006 --> 01:19:33.874
These rocks.

01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:35.943
This...

01:19:37.077 --> 01:19:38.513
cave.

01:19:38.546 --> 01:19:39.847
This...

01:19:40.515 --> 01:19:42.182
slit.

01:19:42.216 --> 01:19:44.485
This...

01:19:46.887 --> 01:19:48.022
What is this?

01:19:54.228 --> 01:19:55.229
Yes.

01:19:57.464 --> 01:19:58.499
Exactly.

01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:02.169
It's the tip of the blade.

01:22:22.009 --> 01:22:23.277
Geoffrey.

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:24.512
No, no, no.

01:22:25.112 --> 01:22:26.280
No, no, no.

01:22:26.313 --> 01:22:27.347
No, no.

01:22:44.465 --> 01:22:45.999
Ms. Marlowe?

01:22:55.175 --> 01:22:56.977
Mrs. Marlowe!

01:33:21.402 --> 01:33:22.903
Look at me, Harper.

01:33:30.244 --> 01:33:31.345
So I died.

01:33:33.681 --> 01:33:36.150
My arm was ripped through
by an iron railing.

01:33:39.153 --> 01:33:40.721
My ankle snapped.

01:33:41.856 --> 01:33:43.924
My internal organs, crushed.

01:33:44.859 --> 01:33:46.627
This is what you did.

01:33:54.702 --> 01:33:55.803
James...

01:33:59.006 --> 01:34:00.741
What is it
that you want from me?

01:34:05.279 --> 01:34:06.647
Your love.

01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:23.063
Yeah.
