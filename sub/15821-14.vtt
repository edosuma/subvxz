00:00.750 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously on the closer...</i>

00:02.383 --> 00:05.000
The protected witness
is sitver there
in the garage

00:05.350 --> 00:06.675
With some old mafia guy.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.900
We will share custody
of deluca with agent hecht,

00:08.900 --> 00:12.400
Who may stay with him
at an lapd safe house

00:12.400 --> 00:14.700
With flynn and provenza.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.450
What's with
the crown royal bag?

00:16.600 --> 00:20.000
I keep my gun in it
when i'm off duty.
It was marty's idea.

00:20.100 --> 00:23.500
The bag is supple.
It helps keep the gun dry.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.400
Huh?
Yeah. That's it.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.225
Brenda: agent hecht.
Agent hecht!

00:28.300 --> 00:30.000
Marty. Marty!
It's a trap.

00:36.833 --> 00:38.633
Sanchez: there you are.
??????

00:41.334 --> 00:43.300
Drop your weapon!

<Font color="#ffff00">sync:frm@lepetitprince</font>

01:50.300 --> 01:52.100
Taylor: all right,
lieutenant.

01:52.150 --> 01:53.650
I got about
10 minutes,

01:53.700 --> 01:54.700
So walk me through this

01:54.700 --> 01:55.900
As fast as you can.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.100
Ok. The victim's
a 16-Year-Old boy

01:58.100 --> 01:59.500
Named malik fara.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.200
Site manager
found him here
this morning at 8:30.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.800
Looks like he was
shot 3 times?

02:07.900 --> 02:10.100
Four, actually.
He's got one
in the back.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.800
The boy falls,
he turns over,

02:11.800 --> 02:13.000
He tries to crawl away,

02:13.300 --> 02:15.000
He falls over
onto his back,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So malik here was looking
straight up at the killer

02:18.000 --> 02:19.800
When he got blasted
in the chest.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.700
Taylor: mchale.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.000
Evidence suggests
that there were
3 people here,

02:25.000 --> 02:26.200
Including
the victim.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.466
We have 3 different
pairs of male shoes.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.267
These footprints
here are malik's,
the blue tape.

02:31.334 --> 02:33.367
Those over there
are the shooter's,
the red tape.

02:33.434 --> 02:36.567
And there's a third set
over by those car
tread marks.

02:36.634 --> 02:40.133
So, fellas, anyone
know why there's
a dead arab teenager

02:40.200 --> 02:42.267
In the middle of nowhere?

02:42.334 --> 02:43.868
Gabriel:
the kid's not
from around here,

02:43.934 --> 02:45.800
Not that anyone
is from around here,

02:45.800 --> 02:48.100
But we found
a library card
in his backpack

02:48.100 --> 02:49.550
That's from
mayflower academy.

02:49.550 --> 02:50.850
Malik might be
a rich kid.

02:50.868 --> 02:52.500
What else did he have,
detective ross?

02:52.500 --> 02:55.501
Some sheet music,
bus schedule,
a change of clothes,

02:55.567 --> 02:57.800
Toothbrush,
and some sandwiches.

02:57.850 --> 02:59.200
Looks like he was
going somewhere.

02:59.267 --> 03:01.133
Mchale: maybe he was
meeting the person
in that car,

03:01.200 --> 03:02.834
Got surprised
by the shooter.

03:02.901 --> 03:05.000
That doesn't explain
why malik brought
a knife with him.

03:05.000 --> 03:05.934
Taylor:
what knife?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.234
Over here.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.300
Let's start
at the beginning.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.000
So we got 3 people.
There's malik,
and over there,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.867
There's the guy
in the car we believe
malik was looking

03:13.933 --> 03:15.800
To meet up with,
and then there's our killer.

03:15.867 --> 03:17.500
Now if we follow
the kid's footprints,

03:17.500 --> 03:20.300
He walks towards the car,
and then from behind
comes the killer.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.700
Malik and the killer
struggle for a moment,

03:22.700 --> 03:24.633
Malik stabs him,
probably in the leg,

03:24.700 --> 03:25.700
Because there's
a blood trail,

03:25.700 --> 03:28.733
And it looks like the guy
was dragging his foot
or maybe limping.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.500
How do we know
it was the boy
who had the knife?

03:30.500 --> 03:32.400
We found a slit
in the pocket
of the jacket

03:32.400 --> 03:33.600
Where the knife
cut through.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.800
Commander, this boy
was scared of someone.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.367
So malik stabs
the shooter,
maybe in the leg.

03:38.434 --> 03:39.768
Malik starts running.

03:39.833 --> 03:42.534
Bam! Shooter hits
boy in the back.

03:42.601 --> 03:44.500
Gabriel:
well, maybe.
We found two casings

03:44.500 --> 03:46.167
Over here where
the two of them struggled

03:46.234 --> 03:48.768
And then 3 more
up by the body,

03:48.833 --> 03:50.301
Probably
from the chest wounds,

03:50.367 --> 03:52.100
And then 3 more
a little further on.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.000
I mean, it was nighttime,
so the kid probably--

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Mchale:
the site manager
i interviewed said

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
That nobody
from the development
company's been here

03:57.000 --> 03:58.767
For 48 hours,
so this could
have happened

03:58.834 --> 04:00.300
During the day
yesterday.

04:00.367 --> 04:02.267
Well, not exactly,
because it didn't
stop raining

04:02.333 --> 04:03.966
Until about 6 p.M.
Yesterday,

04:04.033 --> 04:05.867
And these muddy
footprints were made

04:05.933 --> 04:07.800
Sometime
after the storm,
detective.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.900
Taylor: how did all these
people get here?

04:09.900 --> 04:12.000
I think it's safe
to assume they all drove.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.700
We only found evidence
of one car, sir.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.500
Flynn: look. We should
probably widen

04:18.500 --> 04:20.980
The search perimeter,
get some more personnel--

04:21.000 --> 04:23.200
We can't spare
the resources right
now, lieutenant.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.633
There was
a murder/suicide
in hollywood last night.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.466
Besides, the evidence
seems pretty much
localized.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.967
Well, we won't know
that unless we expand
the perimeter.

04:31.033 --> 04:32.900
After 4 months,
you boys should realize,

04:32.967 --> 04:36.300
We're not playing
this game by atlanta
rules anymore, ok?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.266
Someone get samples
of the blood to the lab.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.867
Those casings go
to ballistics.

04:44.934 --> 04:47.600
You check
with the local hospitals,
see if anyone walked in

04:47.667 --> 04:49.233
With a knife wound
to the leg

04:49.300 --> 04:51.034
And try and wrap
this up.

04:51.099 --> 04:53.767
A lot of people dying
in l.A. This week.

05:06.199 --> 05:10.000
Wow. A 5-Mile run
in 15 minutes.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.100
That's pretty amazing.

05:11.533 --> 05:12.833
How far did you get
this time?

05:12.900 --> 05:15.366
All the way to that
pastry shop i hate.

05:15.433 --> 05:18.300
You know, i have
an idea.

05:18.366 --> 05:21.667
Why don't you call
someone from work

05:21.733 --> 05:23.700
And ask them
out to lunch?

05:23.767 --> 05:24.967
Like who?

05:25.034 --> 05:26.633
Did you ever call
tao back?

05:26.700 --> 05:28.133
Lieutenant tao
doesn't have time

05:28.199 --> 05:29.767
To have lunch
with me.

05:29.833 --> 05:33.034
Besides, he's been
reassigned back
to s.I.D.

05:35.066 --> 05:37.000
Really?

05:37.066 --> 05:38.500
When did that happen?

05:38.567 --> 05:40.199
Last thursday.

05:40.266 --> 05:41.366
Daniels was sent
to liaison

05:41.433 --> 05:42.700
With homeland
security.

05:42.700 --> 05:43.800
I got an e-Mail
from her.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.250
Taylor's
using my paid
administrative leave

05:46.250 --> 05:47.600
To rip
my squad apart.

05:51.967 --> 05:54.233
Well, you got--Ow!

05:54.300 --> 05:55.266
Sorry.

05:59.034 --> 06:02.199
Sanchez and provenza,
i'm sure they would love
to hear from you.

06:02.266 --> 06:03.900
They're in the same
situation you are.

06:03.967 --> 06:05.900
They are not!

06:05.967 --> 06:09.800
Sanchez and provenza
are being investigated
by internal affairs.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.700
Maybe if provenza
hadn't left his gun

06:12.700 --> 06:14.300
In his desk drawer
in a liquor bag

06:14.300 --> 06:15.833
And sanchez hadn't
shot that guy
4 times...

06:15.900 --> 06:17.800
Then the fbi
wouldn't be
using the fact...

06:17.800 --> 06:18.800
Let's not go
through this again.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.000
That a federal agent
was shot to death
in my murder room

06:20.000 --> 06:23.099
By one of their own
protected witnesses
to ruin my career,

06:23.166 --> 06:25.433
And you know it,
you know it,
you know it.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.333
Is there any way
to not have
this argument again?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.733
I'm not the fbi.
I just work there,

06:31.800 --> 06:34.500
And paid administrative
leave is not all bad.

06:34.567 --> 06:36.600
You're getting a check
to just hang out

06:36.667 --> 06:39.099
While the bureau
finishes their
investigation.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.200
If you don't want to
have lunch with someone,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.066
Why don't you use
that time to finish off

06:43.133 --> 06:46.833
Some of the many
projects you've started?

06:46.900 --> 06:50.166
Or maybe clean
them up.

06:50.233 --> 06:53.099
I can't have lunch
with anyone today

06:53.166 --> 06:57.066
Because pope
has called me in
for another meeting,

06:57.133 --> 07:01.066
And he won't say
what it is,
so it's bad,

07:01.133 --> 07:04.500
And if you could
just find out

07:04.567 --> 07:06.733
What the fbi's
saying about me,

07:06.800 --> 07:09.366
Maybe i should just
start looking for work.

07:09.433 --> 07:11.633
I will tell you
immediately.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.633
You know i would.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.733
Honestly, i would.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.833
Ok. I...

07:20.900 --> 07:23.200
Hey, 4 months
seems long,

07:23.200 --> 07:25.500
But it's routine
for an investigation
like this.

07:27.333 --> 07:30.166
Right now,
i have to, uh...

07:30.233 --> 07:31.333
You have to go
to work.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.266
I do, i do.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.266
Don't go to work.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.034
Look. After you
see pope, you'll
call me, ok?

07:37.100 --> 07:38.000
Ok.

07:40.433 --> 07:41.433
And i love you.

07:41.433 --> 07:43.333
I love you, too.

07:45.700 --> 07:46.500
Got to go.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.600
Ok.
Ok.

08:09.199 --> 08:11.800
What about
malik's family?
Mchale?

08:11.867 --> 08:12.967
They're lebanese.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.366
Father's deceased,
mom works nights.

08:15.433 --> 08:17.400
Has no idea why
malik would be
out that late.

08:17.466 --> 08:19.967
He never did that before,
doesn't have a car,

08:20.034 --> 08:21.833
And the mother said
he'd never run away.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.967
What else? Oh.
Malik was some kind
of hardcore pianist.

08:26.034 --> 08:28.366
Played in competitions,
didn't have time
for girls or friends.

08:28.433 --> 08:32.567
Flynn, anything
from the hospitals?

08:32.633 --> 08:34.099
Last night was
a rare one.

08:34.166 --> 08:37.366
Not one stab wound
reported in all
of l.A. County.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.667
Really?

08:38.732 --> 08:40.000
Does anybody have
any ideas

08:40.066 --> 08:44.133
About this
"n-L-E-R-N-L-W-L"

08:44.198 --> 08:45.600
On the boy's hand?

08:45.667 --> 08:47.133
Could be initials,
maybe a girl.

08:47.199 --> 08:51.333
With a long, long,
very long name.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.200
Come on. Ross,
hurry it up.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.300
Ok. The cs show where
we found casings.

08:56.300 --> 08:59.400
These different-Colored
lines are the paths
our 3 players took.

08:59.467 --> 09:01.834
This is malik,
this is the killer,

09:01.901 --> 09:04.034
And this is the guy
from the car.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.001
The casings eject
to the right of the gun,

09:06.068 --> 09:07.834
So we can tell where
our shooter stood

09:07.901 --> 09:09.434
From the rounds
that he fired.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.934
One, the killer
grabs the kid,

09:11.001 --> 09:12.701
And they struggle,
and gun goes off.

09:12.767 --> 09:15.567
Two, he shot malik
in the back from here.

09:15.634 --> 09:17.667
3, he shot
at the guy in the car

09:17.734 --> 09:19.634
Once here, twice here.

09:19.701 --> 09:22.901
And the last 3 casings,
the killer limps
back to malik

09:22.968 --> 09:23.800
And shoots him
in the chest.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.334
Now going back
to the vehicles
for a second--

09:26.400 --> 09:29.167
Wait a minute, ross.
Wait a minute.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.001
Give me this.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.734
Now, look where
the assailant
grabbed malik.

09:37.801 --> 09:40.934
The bruises
on the boy's neck
indicate

09:41.001 --> 09:44.467
That the killer
had him in some kind
of serious choke hold.

09:44.534 --> 09:47.133
Sergeant gabriel.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.367
Now he could have
strangled him then
or shot him.

09:50.434 --> 09:51.700
He had his gun out.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.334
Instead, the killer
shoots forward trying to...

09:54.400 --> 09:56.133
Hit the guy in the car.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.133
Malik stabs
his assailant,
he takes off,

09:58.200 --> 09:59.601
His killer shoots him
in the back,

09:59.667 --> 10:01.934
But even after shooting him,
he doesn't finish him off.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.534
He walks right
past him...

10:03.601 --> 10:05.701
Trying to shoot
the guy in the car.

10:05.767 --> 10:08.000
Malik was not
the primary target.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.600
But malik's
our victim.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.600
Ross, you were
saying something
about the vehicle?

10:15.968 --> 10:18.400
Ross: yeah. The killer's
blood trail stops here,

10:18.467 --> 10:20.068
So it's probably
where he parked.

10:20.133 --> 10:21.834
Excuse me.

10:21.901 --> 10:23.450
Over here, the guy
who ran away,

10:23.450 --> 10:25.200
Fishtails off
in his vehicle un-Hit.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.300
We found no evidence
of broken glass,

10:27.300 --> 10:28.600
Paint chips,
or bullet fragments.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.500
And how did malik
get there?

10:31.100 --> 10:32.400
Gabriel: you remember
the bus schedule

10:32.400 --> 10:34.001
We found in the kid's
backpack.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.500
There's a stop about
3/4 of a mile away.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.700
I contacted the mta.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.900
They tracked down the driver
of the bus last night.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.500
And he said he remembers
seeing malik get
off around 10 p.M.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.100
So the kid walks
almost a mile

10:45.167 --> 10:47.801
In the dead of night
to the middle of nowhere,

10:47.866 --> 10:50.667
And he brought a knife
with him to a gunfight.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.467
Why?

10:56.634 --> 11:00.933
All right.
Detectives ross
and mchale,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.900
See if you can
speed up
the dna test

11:02.966 --> 11:04.900
From the blood
on the knife.

11:04.966 --> 11:07.200
Gabriel, flynn,

11:07.200 --> 11:11.800
Why don't you two
focus on that
murder/suicide for now.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.000
Ross and mchale
can handle this.

11:15.933 --> 11:20.200
Oh. And thank you,
everybody.

11:20.200 --> 11:25.000
Thank y'all
so very, very much.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.334
* thank you *

11:44.700 --> 11:47.600
Oh, i'm sorry, will--
Uh, chief pope.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.000
I was told that you
were ready for me.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
No. We are.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.500
An old friend
of ours would like
to speak with you.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.800
You remember
andrew schmidt?

11:55.700 --> 11:59.550
Andrew, w-What
are you doing here?

11:59.567 --> 12:01.267
Nice to see you
again, too, brenda.

12:01.334 --> 12:02.300
Oh, i'm sorry.

12:02.300 --> 12:07.300
I mean, it's--It's
nice to see you, but--

12:07.300 --> 12:08.600
What am i
doing here?

12:08.667 --> 12:09.933
She was always
very quick

12:10.000 --> 12:11.933
To get
to the point,
wasn't she?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.833
And you don't seem
to have aged at all.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.267
Neither have you, sir.

12:16.334 --> 12:20.701
She's also one
of the best liars
i have ever known.

12:20.767 --> 12:22.833
As you why
i am here...

12:22.900 --> 12:24.650
Commissioner schmidt
thinks he might
be able to make

12:24.650 --> 12:25.850
The federal
investigation

12:25.866 --> 12:28.133
Into the shooting
in your squad room
go away.

12:29.600 --> 12:35.200
Uh, pardon me, andrew,
because that's
a very generous offer

12:35.200 --> 12:36.701
And it's good to see
a friendly face,

12:36.767 --> 12:39.267
But why is the c.I.A.
Interested in helping me?

12:39.334 --> 12:40.567
Oh, they aren't.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.866
In fact, the c.I.A.
Wants you
to help them,

12:43.933 --> 12:47.500
And if you did,
the company would
make certain

12:47.500 --> 12:48.666
That you got
your job back

12:48.667 --> 12:52.966
As a means
of expressing
their thanks.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.866
And if i don't?

12:54.933 --> 12:58.966
Then there
will be nothing
to thank you for.

13:03.634 --> 13:07.067
Ok. How can i help?

13:07.133 --> 13:10.750
Pope: an arab boy
named malik fara

13:10.750 --> 13:12.750
Was found murdered
this morning.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Commander taylor is
investigating it

13:15.000 --> 13:16.900
With what's left
of your squad.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.967
But mr. Taylor lacks
critical information

13:19.033 --> 13:20.500
Necessary to solving
this crime.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.533
The lapd has its own
intelligence division.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.967
They can handle this.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.700
Unfortunately,
malik's murder
is proof

13:28.700 --> 13:30.967
That there is
a significant
breach

13:31.033 --> 13:32.666
In agency security.

13:32.733 --> 13:35.600
The company could
not safely rely on
official channels,

13:35.666 --> 13:37.967
Which is why they've
reached out

13:38.033 --> 13:40.733
To retired personnel
like you and me.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.000
They don't trust
their own people?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.500
They do not.

13:44.366 --> 13:47.867
And all you need
from me is to investigate
the murder of this boy.

13:47.933 --> 13:50.000
Here's what i can
tell you in advance
of an agreement.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
The death
of malik fara

13:52.499 --> 13:54.900
Was almost certainly
a mistake.

13:55.033 --> 13:57.000
The intended victim,
if he's still alive,

13:57.100 --> 14:00.000
Is in terrible
danger.

14:00.633 --> 14:03.500
We must do
everything we can
to save him.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.100
Lastly, the person
who is responsible
for this

14:07.100 --> 14:13.000
Must be found,
debriefed, and held
accountable.

14:15.133 --> 14:17.200
I need my squad
to do this.

14:17.267 --> 14:18.900
I can't give it
to you legally.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.800
You're still under
federal investigation.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.200
If andrew can make
this go away
when i'm done,

14:22.200 --> 14:23.300
Why can't he
do it now?

14:23.300 --> 14:27.500
There is a fear
related to your
past behavior

14:27.500 --> 14:29.800
That you might
be tempted
to substitute

14:29.867 --> 14:32.833
Your own agenda
for ours.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.234
Well, how can i
be expected

14:35.300 --> 14:36.234
To conduct
this investigation

14:36.300 --> 14:39.234
Right under
taylor's nose alone?

14:39.300 --> 14:40.600
I didn't say
you had to work alone.

14:40.666 --> 14:44.867
I said you can't have
your squad back legally.

14:44.933 --> 14:47.000
How you manage
your resources
is up to you.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.600
How is your memory
holding up?

14:50.167 --> 14:51.700
It's excellent.

14:51.766 --> 14:55.700
If you could come
to this address

14:59.234 --> 15:01.800
This evening
at 9:00.

15:04.766 --> 15:07.900
And, um, brenda,
please be sure

15:07.900 --> 15:09.400
You're not
followed, hmm?

15:17.900 --> 15:18.900
I'll see you
tonight.

15:28.300 --> 15:29.400
Be very careful.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.033
I--I hope you have
a written agreement

16:10.100 --> 16:11.966
Stating that if i
solve this murder
for you

16:12.000 --> 16:12.800
I get my job back.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.500
Oh, i do, i do.
Please sit.

16:20.700 --> 16:25.500
Uh, here are some
files you will want.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.200
A database,
one of our laptops,

16:32.800 --> 16:36.900
And a phone
with your hello number.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.400
When you want to
check in,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.800
Identify yourself
as gwen and ask
for mr. Schmidt,

16:42.900 --> 16:43.500
And they'll find me.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.600
Oh. And here's
the agreement

16:47.100 --> 16:49.800
That you need to
read and sign

16:49.800 --> 16:51.000
Before we can proceed.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.700
Oh.
Voila.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.500
Thank you.
You're welcome.

17:00.233 --> 17:01.600
Odd, isn't it,

17:01.600 --> 17:03.700
How our enemies
never change?

17:03.900 --> 17:07.900
During world war ii,
they recited "mein kampf"

17:08.000 --> 17:10.400
While shoving people
into gas chambers,

17:10.467 --> 17:12.599
And during most
of my professional life,

17:12.666 --> 17:15.633
They, uh, shot you
in the back of the head,

17:15.700 --> 17:18.898
Quoting marx and engels,

17:18.965 --> 17:22.500
And now they misuse
the koran.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.800
Same people,
different books.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.250
What was
operation fireproof?

17:36.100 --> 17:38.000
Your signature,
please.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.500
Thank you.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.200
Operation fireproof
was a collections network

17:46.200 --> 17:49.567
Comprised of 4 agents,
who were recruited

17:49.633 --> 17:53.300
From within
the los angeles
iranian community.

17:53.367 --> 17:57.100
Fireproof's focus
was on foreign nationals

17:57.100 --> 17:58.700
Who were trying
to obtain

17:58.700 --> 18:02.800
Nuclear weapons
technology for tehran,

18:03.200 --> 18:07.700
And for a season,
fireproof was
considered successful

18:08.999 --> 18:13.900
Until all
4 of its agents
were murdered,

18:14.999 --> 18:18.400
One after the other
two weeks ago.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.200
And the case officer
in charge

18:23.266 --> 18:25.400
Of operation
fireproof,
larry cole.

18:25.467 --> 18:26.834
Is he still alive?

18:26.899 --> 18:29.500
Yes. And that's
troubling.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.300
I'll say.

18:31.367 --> 18:34.300
Why roll up
the chain and leave
the anchor in place?

18:35.933 --> 18:38.066
And this malik fara?

18:38.133 --> 18:40.767
Tell me, how did
a c.I.A. Officer
get involved

18:40.834 --> 18:43.250
With an adolescent
lebanese
concert pianist?

18:44.767 --> 18:47.800
One day last september,
mr. Cole was intercepted

18:48.800 --> 18:52.400
In an l.A. Parking garage
by this boy--Malik--

18:52.767 --> 18:55.333
Who quietly proceeded
to recite the real names

18:55.400 --> 19:00.266
Of every member
of operation fireproof.

19:00.333 --> 19:03.300
Fireproof was
highly classified,

19:03.367 --> 19:09.734
So there was only one way
that malik could possibly
obtain that information.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.200
The agency has
a mole.

19:11.266 --> 19:14.400
I've always preferred
to use the word traitor,

19:14.467 --> 19:17.966
Especially when blood
was spilled,

19:18.033 --> 19:21.200
And our traitor
is feeding information

19:21.200 --> 19:23.000
To a terrorist organization.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.000
We know this because
malik described

19:26.133 --> 19:27.734
The source
of his knowledge

19:27.800 --> 19:31.834
As a highly trusted contact
within the army of allah.

19:31.899 --> 19:36.500
Now, malik's contact
was willing to
defect to us

19:37.100 --> 19:38.100
On two conditions,

19:38.233 --> 19:40.700
First, that we provide
him and malik

19:40.933 --> 19:43.100
With immunity
from prosecution,

19:43.166 --> 19:48.567
And then that we
should grant them both
u.S. Citizenship.

19:55.033 --> 19:56.600
Man: i'll see
you tomorrow.

19:56.700 --> 19:57.500
Woman: good night.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.900
I'm sorry.
I'm a bit on edge.

20:08.033 --> 20:12.000
So did larry cole
tell his bosses
about malik?

20:12.400 --> 20:15.700
Not at first.
It took mr. Cole
a month to make sure

20:15.700 --> 20:16.600
The boy was safe,

20:17.333 --> 20:20.266
But then when he reported
malik's existence...

20:20.333 --> 20:21.300
No one believed him.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.700
Yeah. Well, the story
is spectacular.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.700
And this friend
of malik,

20:26.800 --> 20:29.800
This terrorist contact
in the army of allah,

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
You think he'll lead
you to your traitor?

20:33.700 --> 20:34.800
Perhaps.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.500
And what do you want
me to do,

20:37.900 --> 20:39.200
Catch malik's
murderer

20:39.200 --> 20:40.900
Or locate
this contact?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.100
I should like you
to do both.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.567
I'm just, um...

20:53.500 --> 20:54.800
I want my job back,

20:56.300 --> 20:59.900
But i'm a criminal
investigator, andrew.

21:00.899 --> 21:03.350
Finding out
who killed malik,
that's my profession.

21:04.734 --> 21:07.100
Handing over
potential defectors
to the c.I.A.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.999
Without knowing why
or what you're gonna
do with them,

21:11.066 --> 21:13.467
I don't do that anymore.

21:17.266 --> 21:20.700
I believe that
the army of allah

21:20.700 --> 21:25.400
Has collected
enough separated
plutonium

21:25.899 --> 21:28.100
To create
an atomic bomb.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.000
I need to find
that separated
plutonium,

21:32.300 --> 21:34.000
And i need you
to help me.

21:38.066 --> 21:42.133
Stealing
information,
passing secrets,

21:42.200 --> 21:43.500
Reading
other people's mail,

21:43.500 --> 21:45.100
Blackmailing
foreigners,

21:45.667 --> 21:48.500
Lying
to your friends
and your loved ones

21:48.567 --> 21:49.899
About your
daily lives--

21:49.966 --> 21:55.900
We are most days
gray people
doing gray jobs,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.900
Shadows in a world
of black and white,

21:59.800 --> 22:02.100
But then,
you know, every
once in a while,

22:02.933 --> 22:04.900
We're offered
the opportunity

22:05.600 --> 22:08.100
Where we have
the chance to
do something

22:08.100 --> 22:11.250
That is
absolutely right
to its very core!

22:14.467 --> 22:16.200
This is one
of those times,
brenda.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.900
I'll help you, andrew.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.500
If i can talk
to who i want.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.600
People will cooperate?

22:30.600 --> 22:32.200
Company people, yes.

22:33.767 --> 22:37.233
Richard branch,
chief of our outpost
in los angeles.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.533
If you tell him
what you want,

22:38.600 --> 22:40.700
Richard
will arrange it.

22:40.767 --> 22:44.933
This friend of malik's,
what position does he hold
in the army of allah?

22:44.999 --> 22:46.000
I don't know.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
How did he communicate
with malik?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.900
I don't know.
What's
his nationality?

22:49.900 --> 22:50.800
I don't know.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.900
Well, what does
he look like?

22:52.800 --> 22:53.900
I don't know.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.100
How old is he?
I don't know.

22:56.433 --> 22:57.734
Then how in the hell
you plan on finding him?

22:57.800 --> 22:58.933
He's probably
on the database

22:58.999 --> 23:00.367
Of possible
terrorist associates

23:00.433 --> 23:01.500
I was given
access to.

23:02.866 --> 23:04.933
Terrorist
associates. Yeah.

23:04.999 --> 23:06.433
How many names
in that database?

23:06.500 --> 23:07.950
Approximately
60,000.

23:07.950 --> 23:08.950
Oh, crapola.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.500
Now i'm getting
irritated.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.800
Why are you even
looking for this guy
if he's not the killer?

23:13.800 --> 23:15.300
Because his life
is in danger

23:15.300 --> 23:18.100
And because he might
have information
the c.I.A. Wants.

23:18.100 --> 23:19.600
Let's get back
to that for a minute.

23:20.400 --> 23:24.000
I still don't get why
the c.I.A. Is asking
you to do anything.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.967
I told you already,
lieutenant.

23:26.034 --> 23:28.500
They came to me
out of the blue
with this offer,

23:28.500 --> 23:30.950
And if it gets
us back in
the squad room--

23:30.950 --> 23:32.300
Don't kid yourself,
chief.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.900
I'll help you out.
I got nothing else to do,

23:36.500 --> 23:38.333
But i could find
the lindbergh baby,

23:38.399 --> 23:40.566
And it wouldn't get me
back into our squad room.

23:40.633 --> 23:44.000
No, no, no.
The lapd is
retiring my ass.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.300
I won't let them.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.600
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.500
So...

23:55.000 --> 23:55.800
Where do we start?

23:56.366 --> 23:59.400
Well, i don't
fully understand

23:59.400 --> 24:01.400
How malik came
to be where he was,

24:01.400 --> 24:03.300
So i want to see
where he died,

24:03.466 --> 24:06.100
But i want to see it
like he did--At night.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.000
And we might need
a little help.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.200
Thanks for your help,
lieutenant flynn.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.400
I know you have other work.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.000
That's ok, chief. I've
got gabriel covering it.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.900
Besides, it's
a murder/suicide.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.334
Except for
the paperwork,

24:18.401 --> 24:19.720
It kind of
solves itself.

24:21.401 --> 24:25.300
Anyway, the crime scene
is right through this gate.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.334
That's where he died.

24:26.401 --> 24:27.867
I want to find out
how he got there.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.967
Wouldn't he go in
through the main
road here?

24:30.034 --> 24:32.533
If he was in a car,
but he was on foot.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.200
Excuse me.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.134
How are things going
with taylor?

24:43.200 --> 24:45.533
Oh, just great.
He's been passing
investigations off

24:45.600 --> 24:48.067
To other divisions
and counting them
as clearance on paper.

24:48.134 --> 24:49.666
We're doing
30% better.

24:49.733 --> 24:50.600
Asshole.

24:50.650 --> 24:51.250
Look.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.400
What?
There.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.200
What's that?
An illuminated
marker.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.533
Who would
notice that?

24:55.599 --> 24:57.632
Someone who's
looking for it.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.400
Provenza:
whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.000
This is creepy.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.000
You want me
to hold you?

25:08.866 --> 25:09.800
Brenda: ok.

25:11.899 --> 25:13.900
"N" and "l."

25:14.599 --> 25:17.800
Now, let's go north
and look left.

25:18.033 --> 25:19.200
Which way is north?

25:21.033 --> 25:23.700
North is this way.

25:23.700 --> 25:27.600
North and look left.

25:28.700 --> 25:29.700
Look at that.

25:43.133 --> 25:46.500
Ok, last one.
Go west and look left.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.200
I told taylor we should
expand the crime scene.

25:48.266 --> 25:49.700
No, this is
phosphorescent dye.

25:49.767 --> 25:51.467
It wouldn't have shown up
in the daytime anyway.

25:51.533 --> 25:53.667
Let's keep following
malik's directions.

25:53.733 --> 25:55.300
How does she know
about this stuff?

25:59.300 --> 26:00.800
Flynn: so, chief,
the crime scene's

26:00.867 --> 26:03.133
Just up
that hill a piece.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.400
Ok.

26:05.500 --> 26:08.200
So all these markers
are so malik
can find his way

26:08.200 --> 26:10.000
While being sure
he wasn't followed.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.500
He would have
arrived here

26:11.500 --> 26:12.900
Feeling like he
avoided surveillance,

26:13.100 --> 26:15.600
And he waited until
the guy in the car
drove up.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.220
Was there anything
in his knapsack

26:18.267 --> 26:19.800
He could have used
to signal his friend?

26:19.900 --> 26:20.600
No, chief.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.400
Wait, wait.
What about this?

26:29.100 --> 26:30.600
What are you looking for?

26:34.200 --> 26:35.100
A transmitter.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.200
Huh.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.600
That explains how
malik was followed here.

26:40.467 --> 26:43.500
And why he didn't
know it.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.100
So taylor is
investigating

26:52.100 --> 26:54.700
The murder of malik
from the boy's end,

26:54.700 --> 26:57.400
And we'd better leave
him to it. So let's
discuss what we know

26:57.400 --> 26:59.700
About the guy
from the car--
Malik's friend.

26:59.700 --> 27:02.300
First, he's
foreign because one of
the things he asked for

27:02.300 --> 27:03.400
Was u.S. Citizenship,

27:03.800 --> 27:06.100
And he asked for
immunity from prosecution,

27:06.100 --> 27:08.450
So he's participated
in criminal activity,

27:08.500 --> 27:09.800
Probably terrorism.

27:10.167 --> 27:14.233
We also know that
he communicated
with malik recently

27:14.300 --> 27:16.700
Because the boy
had freshly written
directions on his hand.

27:16.700 --> 27:20.000
And i think that
we can assume that
the guy from the car

27:20.000 --> 27:21.067
Picked the rendezvous point.

27:21.133 --> 27:23.600
We also know
he got there
sometime after 6:00,

27:23.667 --> 27:24.500
When it stopped
raining,

27:24.500 --> 27:26.600
Because the dye
he used to mark
malik's route

27:26.600 --> 27:28.000
Would have washed
away in the rain.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.900
And we almost
have his height.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.600
He had a size
12 shoe,

27:31.600 --> 27:32.722
Plus running
back to the car,

27:32.723 --> 27:34.700
His stride
was at least
5 feet long.

27:34.966 --> 27:36.900
So he's got to be
6 feet tall.

27:36.966 --> 27:38.300
You know what?

27:38.367 --> 27:39.734
Shh!
Shh! What is...

27:39.801 --> 27:40.600
[Whispering]
what is wrong
with you?

27:41.833 --> 27:45.801
The guy--Let's
call him mr. T.

27:45.866 --> 27:48.534
"T" for terrorist.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.534
So mr. T has been
in l.A. Longer than
just yesterday,

27:52.600 --> 27:56.600
Because
the place he chose for
the meeting with malik

27:56.667 --> 27:58.700
Is not on
a lot of tour guides.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.800
Howard: brenda, come to bed.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.400
Brenda: let's wrap
this up.

28:04.534 --> 28:08.300
Uh, we still have not
narrowed down very much

28:08.367 --> 28:10.900
Who mr. T might be,
and we know nothing

28:10.900 --> 28:12.700
Of how he communicated
with malik.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.300
Um...this is
gonna be hard.

28:15.300 --> 28:17.500
Lieutenant flynn,
if you and sergeant gabriel

28:17.500 --> 28:19.600
Could copy the malik
murder book for me

28:19.632 --> 28:22.100
Without taylor
finding out about it.

28:23.900 --> 28:27.300
And, um, if the killer's dna
came back from that knife,

28:27.300 --> 28:28.500
I'd like that, too,
please.

28:29.066 --> 28:30.799
Yes, ma'am.
I'll help you any
way i can,

28:30.866 --> 28:33.200
But mainly because
i really miss hearing
the word "please."

28:36.699 --> 28:38.699
Uh, lieutenant
provenza and i

28:38.766 --> 28:40.899
Are going to look
for the killer

28:40.966 --> 28:42.833
Without creating
too much tension.

28:42.899 --> 28:44.333
How do you intend
to do that?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.033
By going where
taylor can't.

28:46.700 --> 28:47.800
Good night.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.370
Good night, sergeant.
Thank you.

28:49.370 --> 28:50.200
Good night,
chief.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.800
Wait a minute.
W-Wait a minute.

28:52.700 --> 28:54.200
You're not going to
tell them anything

28:54.200 --> 28:56.400
About this
operation fireproof?

28:56.400 --> 28:58.500
I don't know enough
about it myself
yet, lieutenant.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.100
That's why tomorrow

29:00.200 --> 29:02.700
I'm meeting with
some of the people
that put it together.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.468
This richard branch, who
heads up the c.I.A. Show

29:05.535 --> 29:07.199
Here in los angeles.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.800
He's gonna
take me around.

29:10.650 --> 29:11.800
This is dangerous.

29:12.200 --> 29:15.700
We know of 5 people
already connected
to fireproof

29:15.700 --> 29:16.500
Who have been
murdered.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.266
So if anything
happens to me,

29:18.333 --> 29:19.899
I'm gonna need you
to be able to report

29:19.966 --> 29:21.433
On the substance
of what i've done,

29:21.500 --> 29:23.765
But you can't be at
any of the interviews,

29:23.832 --> 29:26.199
And the c.I.A. Can't
know about it.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.200
Ok...
[double-O 7]
007.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.600
Just tell me what
you want me to do.

29:43.966 --> 29:45.500
Buzz watson. How
can i help you?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.500
Chief johnson
wants what?

29:52.900 --> 29:54.300
Push the other
button.

29:55.932 --> 29:57.500
I can't hear
very well.

29:57.699 --> 29:59.266
It'd be easier
if you drove

29:59.333 --> 30:00.732
And let me handle
the equipment.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.966
Since when have i
ever wanted to make
things easy for you?

30:04.032 --> 30:05.799
Right.

30:05.866 --> 30:08.200
Brenda: so, richard,
how long have you been

30:08.200 --> 30:10.200
Chief of outpost
here in los angeles?

30:10.899 --> 30:13.332
Two years, so i was
in charge out here

30:13.333 --> 30:15.000
During some
of fireproof,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
But i didn't know
what the operation
was about

30:19.000 --> 30:20.700
Until andrew
showed up asking
questions.

30:21.300 --> 30:22.200
And when was that?

30:23.500 --> 30:25.400
Uh, right after
larry cole was fired.

30:26.865 --> 30:29.000
Oh, i thought andrew
didn't come until
fireproof station

30:29.000 --> 30:29.700
Started dying.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.800
No, no. He was here
much earlier than that.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.500
Ok. Pull over, buzz.
Pull over. They've stopped.

30:43.199 --> 30:44.100
Pull over. Pull over!

30:45.100 --> 30:46.200
Give me a second.

30:46.732 --> 30:48.000
I might ought to
tell you

30:48.000 --> 30:50.078
That elaine donahue
is angry about this.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.000
To her way of
thinking,

30:51.000 --> 30:52.932
She organized
fireproof perfectly

30:52.999 --> 30:54.499
And it's still
a big success,

30:54.566 --> 30:56.433
So be careful how
you approach her.

30:56.499 --> 30:57.865
She can be
a raving bitch.

30:57.932 --> 30:59.700
Thanks for the advice.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.800
And by what name
would you like
to be introduced?

31:01.900 --> 31:03.300
You can call me
brenda.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.100
The raving bitch
and i are old
friends.

31:14.666 --> 31:15.900
Hello.
Hello.

31:16.199 --> 31:18.666
My name's cynthia.
I won't bother to
ask your names,

31:18.732 --> 31:20.266
Because i know
you'd only lie.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.200
My mother's expecting
you in the back.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.466
I'd appreciate it
if you kept
your questions

31:24.533 --> 31:25.832
To a minimum.

31:25.899 --> 31:27.166
Even though she's
desperately lonely,

31:27.233 --> 31:28.799
She's been
emotionally
exhausted

31:28.865 --> 31:31.533
From the way
you people have
treated her, so...

31:33.865 --> 31:35.166
Hurry it up.

31:35.233 --> 31:36.600
Thank you.

31:40.799 --> 31:43.466
Brenda leigh johnson!

31:44.799 --> 31:47.700
Which of my old students
could andrew have sent

31:47.700 --> 31:49.700
To more lighten
my mood?

31:49.799 --> 31:52.066
Richard, good of you
to come.

31:52.132 --> 31:53.999
Nice to see you,
too, elaine.

31:54.066 --> 31:55.199
I set this all out
last night

31:55.266 --> 31:57.032
While cynthia
was asleep.

31:57.099 --> 31:58.932
She's angry
on my behalf, you know.

31:58.999 --> 32:00.466
Did you hear, brenda?

32:00.533 --> 32:02.266
Richard is
my new boss.

32:02.333 --> 32:04.832
One day i'm reading
his reports at langley,

32:04.899 --> 32:09.099
Feeling slightly
sorry for his
backwater posting,

32:09.166 --> 32:11.433
And the very next week,
i am shuffled off

32:11.499 --> 32:14.932
To be officer in
residence at ucla,

32:14.999 --> 32:18.400
Writing up little
summaries on foreign
exchange students.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.166
Such a change
of pace.

32:20.233 --> 32:21.366
I hope you like
the cake.

32:21.433 --> 32:23.366
It's store-Bought
but from a good store.

32:23.433 --> 32:24.799
Devil's food.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.900
Thank you, elaine.
That's so nice of you.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.200
So how is andrew,
anyway?

32:32.299 --> 32:33.899
I heard he looks
horrible.

32:33.966 --> 32:35.399
Someone said cancer.

32:35.466 --> 32:36.966
I hope that's not true.

32:38.499 --> 32:40.800
So i was wondering
if you could tell me

32:40.800 --> 32:42.300
About operation
fireproof.

32:42.300 --> 32:45.234
Of course. That's why
we're sitting here,
isn't it?

32:45.300 --> 32:48.534
Because andrew says
fireproof blew up
in my face,

32:48.601 --> 32:49.833
Which is complete
bull---.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.400
I made coffee. Anyone?

32:51.467 --> 32:52.634
No, thank you.
Not me.

32:52.701 --> 32:55.200
Ok, so the set piece.

32:55.267 --> 32:57.300
After the invasion
of iraq,

32:57.367 --> 33:00.730
The c.I.A.'S domestic
activities division

33:00.730 --> 33:04.033
Approves a collection
operation code named
fireproof.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.300
Fireproof's first
recruited agent turns out
to be a gold mine--

33:08.766 --> 33:10.500
Mr. Mohammed nuballe,

33:10.567 --> 33:13.167
An iranian banker
living in l.A.,

33:13.234 --> 33:15.267
With connections
to the army of allah.

33:15.334 --> 33:18.100
He was transferring
large wads of cash

33:18.167 --> 33:22.701
From an army of allah
charity to a russian
entrepreneur,

33:22.766 --> 33:25.534
A former kgb officer
named voitski.

33:25.601 --> 33:28.567
Have you ever heard
of a military base
in russia

33:28.634 --> 33:30.467
Called
krasny szesenski?

33:30.534 --> 33:32.334
It translates
into english as--

33:32.400 --> 33:33.833
Red pines.
I remember.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.733
It's a nuclear
missile installation.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.933
Correct. That's

33:38.000 --> 33:39.766
What mr. Voitski
sold to

33:39.833 --> 33:41.467
The army of allah,
my dear.

33:41.534 --> 33:43.434
A decommissioned
missile.

33:43.500 --> 33:47.800
In parts. Useless
as a weapon, but still.

33:47.866 --> 33:50.300
I find that a little
hard to believe.

33:50.367 --> 33:52.000
Elaine, what
makes you think

33:52.067 --> 33:53.833
The army of allah
was able to pull off

33:53.900 --> 33:55.567
Buying a russian
nuclear missile?

33:55.634 --> 33:57.733
I don't think.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.133
I know.

33:59.250 --> 34:01.617
We found actionable
intelligence

34:01.684 --> 34:03.584
Proving that's what
they were gonna do,

34:03.651 --> 34:05.700
And i convinced
the company's board
of directors

34:05.700 --> 34:08.900
To let voitski sell
the army of allah
that missile

34:08.900 --> 34:12.550
And to focus
every conceivable
surveillance asset

34:12.600 --> 34:16.199
On following that missile
from red pines to berlin.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.199
And elaine succeeded,
didn't she, richard?

34:19.500 --> 34:21.900
Yeah. We got
the missile back,

34:22.166 --> 34:24.250
Plus a fair number
of their support
network.

34:24.699 --> 34:27.699
So what makes operation
fireproof a failure?

34:29.199 --> 34:31.900
Larry cole
and that boy malik,

34:32.100 --> 34:33.634
Who suddenly pops up
out of nowhere

34:33.699 --> 34:38.167
And tells us we were
duped, faked out, misled,

34:38.234 --> 34:41.668
That operation
fireproof was acting
on framed material.

34:41.733 --> 34:44.301
That while we were
focusing on red pines,

34:44.367 --> 34:47.100
The real money was
changing hands elsewhere

34:47.167 --> 34:48.833
And that that support
team we rolled up

34:48.900 --> 34:51.699
Was all part of
a kleenex network--

34:51.766 --> 34:54.833
Tissue terrorists--
Manufactured to be
thrown away.

34:54.900 --> 34:57.267
So elaine found
the missile.

34:57.334 --> 35:00.900
Yes, she did, and some
very bad people.

35:00.967 --> 35:02.434
And what did elaine
get for it?

35:02.501 --> 35:04.833
Her daughter's
greenhouse.

35:04.900 --> 35:08.301
Banished. Banished.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.800
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

35:09.867 --> 35:12.634
Watering
my daughter's plants!

35:12.700 --> 35:17.034
I want my job back,
brenda. Pretty please.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.967
I want my job back.

35:23.267 --> 35:27.501
So if not red pines,
where was the real
money changing hands?

35:28.800 --> 35:31.668
If you want to know
what larry cole thinks,

35:31.733 --> 35:33.267
Talk to him.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.334
And you want to
hide this because...

35:54.334 --> 35:57.650
Brenda: the murder
book that lieutenant
flynn got for me

35:57.700 --> 35:59.300
Is all i need
for right now.

35:59.300 --> 36:00.900
Besides, when larry
cole gets here,

36:00.900 --> 36:02.000
I don't want
him to see

36:02.000 --> 36:03.300
Malik's picture
all over the place

36:03.700 --> 36:04.800
Or how little we know.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.300
By the way, are you
carrying your gun?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.500
You mean the gun
that got us both

36:10.500 --> 36:12.300
Put on administrative
leave? That gun?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.100
Better that one
than none at all.

36:16.734 --> 36:18.100
[Whispering]
go on. Go. Go on.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.200
Do you want
some help?

36:29.600 --> 36:31.000
I got it. I got it.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.100
Brenda: please
have a seat.

36:37.333 --> 36:40.500
Mr. Cole, there's
so much i've been
waiting to ask you

36:40.500 --> 36:41.500
I hardly know
where to begin,

36:43.134 --> 36:45.500
But first,
looking at your
personnel file,

36:45.500 --> 36:47.200
Let me say how
sorry i am

36:47.200 --> 36:48.300
About your
recent divorce

36:48.400 --> 36:50.667
And losing
custody of
your son like that,

36:50.734 --> 36:53.800
Then getting fired
with not very good
references.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.500
That's tough.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.067
And then just when
you're facing all
those personal

36:58.133 --> 36:59.500
And financial
pressures,

36:59.700 --> 37:01.700
All of your agents
are murdered,

37:01.800 --> 37:03.600
And now malik, too.

37:04.234 --> 37:05.900
I think you were
the only person

37:05.967 --> 37:07.450
Familiar with
all the victims.

37:07.467 --> 37:08.701
Is that right?

37:08.766 --> 37:10.000
Obviously not.

37:10.300 --> 37:12.400
Can you think
of anyone else
who knew them...

37:12.500 --> 37:14.700
While they were
alive, i mean?

37:14.800 --> 37:16.933
No.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.500
You know,
elaine donahue
made a suggestion

37:19.500 --> 37:20.700
That we should
discuss.

37:20.700 --> 37:23.800
She believes
you made malik up
out of thin air,

37:24.400 --> 37:27.300
Because no one else
ever spoke to him
or saw him.

37:27.967 --> 37:30.000
Just you. Do you
have any idea

37:30.067 --> 37:31.750
How we can
confirm your report?

37:31.800 --> 37:34.400
How about this. The kid
said it was dangerous,
and now he's dead.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.300
But how do we know
you weren't just
waiting around

37:36.300 --> 37:38.600
For the first dead
arab teenager to
turn up in the news,

37:38.600 --> 37:40.600
That you
didn't latch on
to malik's murder

37:40.600 --> 37:42.940
And say, "oh, that was
the boy i was telling
everyone about"?

37:42.940 --> 37:45.906
You never identified
malik fara until
after he was dead.

37:45.973 --> 37:47.700
I was trying
to protect him.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.800
Well, you didn't do
a very good job,
did you?

37:52.940 --> 37:58.200
I have a copy
of everything that
the lapd has compiled

37:58.200 --> 38:01.000
In this investigation,
and there is nothing
here indicating

38:01.000 --> 38:06.200
How malik communicated
with his contact inside
the army of allah.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.750
Do you have any idea
how they traded messages
with each other?

38:08.750 --> 38:09.500
No.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.800
Are you, by any chance,
trying to protect
malik's friend?

38:11.800 --> 38:12.600
No.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.133
It's been suggested
that malik was
running away,

38:15.200 --> 38:18.699
But the only i.D.
Found in his knapsack
was a library card.

38:18.766 --> 38:20.733
Where might his passport
have been?

38:20.799 --> 38:21.700
He didn't have
a passport.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.200
He was living here
illegally.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.500
We have dna
from malik's killer.

38:27.699 --> 38:29.000
Anyone you can
think of

38:29.000 --> 38:30.900
We might match those
results against?

38:31.100 --> 38:33.000
If you want to accuse me,
my dna's on file.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.500
Andrew can get it for you.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.333
Look. I am not a killer.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.000
Malik was real.
His information was real.

38:41.066 --> 38:43.233
This whole red pines thing
that elaine is so proud of,

38:43.300 --> 38:44.833
It was a whopping
big misdirect.

38:44.900 --> 38:48.200
Richard: while we were
bluffed into using
all our assets

38:48.200 --> 38:49.300
To cover the missile,

38:49.433 --> 38:51.500
The real action was
going down in obninsk.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.600
Thank you, richard,
but i don't need
answers from you.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.300
Richard: well, but
you're asking the wrong
questions, ma'am.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.300
Do you even know what
russia stores at obninsk?

39:00.300 --> 39:02.500
About 60 tons
of separated plutonium.

39:02.800 --> 39:07.000
But it doesn't take
60 tons to make a bomb,
does it? No.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.600
It only takes 20 pounds,
about that much.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.298
Our scientists turn up
their noses at
separated plutonium.

39:12.299 --> 39:15.000
It's not as good as
the stuff we use
in our bombs,

39:15.000 --> 39:16.133
But it will do the job.

39:16.199 --> 39:17.500
Is that what
malik told you

39:17.700 --> 39:19.233
The army of allah
had done--

39:19.299 --> 39:21.300
Misdirected our
assets so they
could smuggle

39:21.300 --> 39:23.200
Separated plutonium
out of obninsk?

39:23.200 --> 39:24.900
In a round
stainless-Steel container

39:24.900 --> 39:26.600
About 10 inches
in diameter,

39:26.700 --> 39:28.800
Made to look like
an oversized hockey puck.

39:28.800 --> 39:32.301
And this mr. Nuballe,
the iranian banker

39:32.367 --> 39:34.134
That you leveraged
into helping you,

39:34.201 --> 39:35.767
Did he misdirect you
about red pines?

39:35.833 --> 39:38.700
No. No. Nuballe
never knew what
he was paying for.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.568
He was a cutout,
a go-Between.

39:40.634 --> 39:43.167
We got the intelligence
about the missile
from the seller,

39:43.234 --> 39:44.401
Mr. Voitski.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.600
I, uh...

39:48.500 --> 39:49.800
I trained a young girl.

39:52.301 --> 39:54.501
Dara. College student.

39:54.568 --> 39:56.568
Used her
as a honey trap.

39:56.634 --> 39:59.100
She seduced voitski,
had an affair with him.

39:59.167 --> 40:00.668
Whenever voitski
took her out,

40:00.733 --> 40:02.000
We would go through
his stuff.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.600
Dara. Yes.

40:05.067 --> 40:07.400
That's another one
of your agents who's
no longer with us.

40:09.467 --> 40:11.300
You seem to have
been close to her.

40:12.100 --> 40:14.800
Training a young
girl to seduce
older men--

40:14.800 --> 40:16.000
That's tricky.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.500
How did you
manage that?

40:20.467 --> 40:21.900
Or should i ask
your ex-Wife?

40:26.000 --> 40:26.800
Moving on.

40:27.501 --> 40:29.900
What did voitski say
when you picked him up?

40:29.900 --> 40:31.100
Cole: we didn't
pick him up.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.767
The company felt
that voitski was
the only ongoing connection

40:33.833 --> 40:36.601
To the army of allah,
and we felt it was
important

40:36.668 --> 40:38.100
To leave him out there.

40:38.167 --> 40:41.067
Out where, mr. Cole?
And by where, i mean
his address.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.600
Gabriel: ok, chief.
Voitski's parking

40:44.600 --> 40:45.800
Outside of his
apartment building.

40:45.934 --> 40:48.733
He's getting out
of his car now.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.534
Uh-Huh. Hold on.
Hold on a minute.

40:56.634 --> 40:58.134
Wait a minute.

40:59.568 --> 41:02.700
Ooh, chief.
Chief, he's limping

41:03.900 --> 41:04.800
Towards
the front door.

41:04.800 --> 41:05.600
What do you
want us to do?

41:06.167 --> 41:07.700
Good lord, buzz.
Drive faster.

41:07.767 --> 41:09.601
Hang on.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.000
He didn't see you,
did he?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.900
No. No, he didn't
see us.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.167
Uh-Huh. Ok.
Yes, ma'am.

41:16.234 --> 41:17.000
We'll wait for you.

41:22.367 --> 41:24.000
Sure he didn't see you?

41:24.067 --> 41:25.668
Gabriel: i'm positive.

41:26.833 --> 41:29.301
Lieutenant,
are you ok?

41:29.367 --> 41:32.833
Uh, oh, yeah. Yeah.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.601
Wait. Hold on
a second.

41:34.668 --> 41:37.167
Pope told us to bring
some extra stuff.

41:39.401 --> 41:40.800
Ok.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.500
Lieutenant, you're
gonna have to wear a gun
sooner or later,

41:45.500 --> 41:47.067
And i feel sooner
very strongly right now.

42:07.167 --> 42:09.067
Brenda: not
that one. It's 614.

42:19.700 --> 42:23.134
Mr. Voitski!
Yoo-Hoo! Mr. Voitski!

42:26.434 --> 42:29.234
You two turn around.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.733
Chief, we need
a warrant for that.

42:39.800 --> 42:43.201
Oh, you do. We're on
administrative leave.

42:43.267 --> 42:45.700
You two stay right there.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.767
Mr. Voitski?

42:50.833 --> 42:52.434
Mr. Voitski!

42:54.301 --> 42:56.267
Mr. Voitski!
Yoo-Hoo!

42:56.334 --> 42:58.800
Mr. Voitski?

42:59.767 --> 43:01.100
Mr. Voitski?

43:10.434 --> 43:14.100
Lieutenant provenza,
please pull down
mr. Voitski's pants.

43:14.167 --> 43:15.634
What?

43:15.700 --> 43:17.467
Pull down his pants, please.

43:17.534 --> 43:19.167
Ok, what's going on
in there, you two?

43:19.234 --> 43:21.434
We're just checking
to make sure we're alone.

43:21.501 --> 43:23.301
Stay by the door.

43:24.900 --> 43:29.100
Mrs. Gwynn, i need
mr. Schmidt, please.

43:32.833 --> 43:33.934
Hello?

43:34.000 --> 43:35.501
Provenza: chief.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.267
I found the man
who killed malik.

43:39.334 --> 43:41.334
Does the name
voitski ring a bell?

43:43.201 --> 43:44.900
Dear god.

43:44.967 --> 43:48.733
So as far as
i'm concerned,

43:48.800 --> 43:51.733
My work here
is through.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.833
If you want
my continued
assistance, andrew,

43:53.900 --> 43:55.800
Identifying
malik's friend,

43:55.867 --> 43:58.334
Finding your mole
and the separated
plutonium,

43:58.401 --> 43:59.767
We're gonna have to
change the rules.

43:59.833 --> 44:01.800
What do you want?

44:01.867 --> 44:04.434
I want my job back
with my squad intact,

44:04.501 --> 44:08.500
Or i hang up,
walk away, and you can
clean this mess up

44:08.500 --> 44:09.201
On your own.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.900
So, andrew,
what's it gonna be?

44:23.300 --> 44:25.500
Are you guys--You sure
you don't need any help

44:25.500 --> 44:27.100
Carrying your stuff back
to, uh...

44:27.500 --> 44:28.800
Robbery homicide?

44:29.700 --> 44:31.600
I'm good.
Thanks.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.400
Great working
with you guys.

44:33.433 --> 44:34.700
Yeah. Bye.

44:40.667 --> 44:42.400
Tao: people never
take dust...

44:44.467 --> 44:45.100
Seriously.

44:48.200 --> 44:48.900
Oh.
Oh.

44:48.900 --> 44:51.850
I'm sorry, commander.
I should have knocked.
Is this a bad time?

44:51.850 --> 44:52.800
No, no.

44:52.800 --> 44:56.100
Always happy to see
the lapd and the fbi

44:56.100 --> 44:57.100
Working together.

45:00.099 --> 45:01.300
Taylor:
deputy chief johnson.

45:01.300 --> 45:02.000
Commander.

45:02.300 --> 45:03.950
So, what should we do
with the rest

45:03.950 --> 45:05.800
Of your stuff?
Ohh!
Oh, my god.

45:15.410 --> 45:17.610
I'll,uh,have my secretary

45:17.680 --> 45:18.980
Come down later this afternoon

45:19.050 --> 45:20.650
Tap e  mings.

45:20.710 --> 45:22.810
I can see how anxious you are to get back to work.

45:24.950 --> 45:26.350
I got it.

45:26.410 --> 45:27.810
Taylor: thank you.

45:27.880 --> 45:29.550
Not on the plane.

45:29.610 --> 45:32.010
Here,here.

45:32.080 --> 45:34.050
Thank you.

45:34.110 --> 45:35.410
Thank you,commander.

45:35.480 --> 45:37.650
You're welcome,chief.

45:37.710 --> 45:39.180
Agent howard.

45:47.950 --> 45:50.150
Man: i thought about going to confession.

45:50.210 --> 45:52.580
He came over here. He,like,moves all the stuff.

45:52.650 --> 45:54.510
Did you see the picture of the fireworks?

45:54.580 --> 45:55.850
Look at this.

45:55.910 --> 45:57.610
Who takes pictures of fireworks?

45:57.680 --> 46:01.010
Tao: i need disinfectant.

46:11.880 --> 46:13.250
[Exhales]

46:15.910 --> 46:18.150
Well...

46:21.210 --> 46:22.350
Welcome back.

46:22.410 --> 46:24.350
It's nice to see y'all again.

46:24.410 --> 46:26.310
Let me just bring everyone up to the minute

46:26.380 --> 46:28.010
On the malik fara murder.

46:28.080 --> 46:31.010
Malik's killer was found late yesterday,

46:31.080 --> 46:34.680
A russian ex-K.G.B. Officer by the name of voitski.

46:34.750 --> 46:36.180
Has voitski been arrested?

46:36.250 --> 46:37.880
No,somebody called in a gas leak

46:37.950 --> 46:39.410
At voitski's apartment.

46:39.480 --> 46:42.080
Gas company comes out,finds voitski murdered,

46:42.150 --> 46:44.480
No leak except the blood running out of his head.

46:44.550 --> 46:48.010
Gabriel: someone shoved an ice pick through mr. Voitski's ear,

46:48.080 --> 46:49.210
Into his brain.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.810
So he is kind of a dead end.

46:50.880 --> 46:52.350
And that's a problem because...?

46:52.410 --> 46:53.850
Because malik fara was meeting someone

46:53.910 --> 46:55.280
The night he was murdered,

46:55.350 --> 46:56.780
And we need to find that person for...

46:56.850 --> 46:58.850
All sorts of reasons.

46:58.910 --> 47:01.380
The name of malik's missing friend

47:01.450 --> 47:03.110
Is most likely one of 60,000

47:03.180 --> 47:05.980
Contained on the database of this computer,lieutenant tao.

47:06.050 --> 47:08.310
And lieutenant provenza has certain search criteria

47:08.380 --> 47:10.010
That you and detective daniels

47:10.080 --> 47:12.280
Can use to narrow down the list.

47:12.350 --> 47:15.050
Chief,just to be clear about this malik fara,

47:15.110 --> 47:17.680
We're investigating a murder that you already solved?

47:17.750 --> 47:20.650
Well,yes,but who murdered the murderer?

47:20.710 --> 47:24.510
Voitski didn't stick an ice pick into his own head.

47:26.950 --> 47:29.910
Lieutenant flynn can fill you in on the details.

47:29.980 --> 47:31.680
I can?

47:33.210 --> 47:35.080
Ok,uh...

47:35.150 --> 47:38.980
This is what i think we know.

47:39.050 --> 47:41.950
I'd put you in an interview room,mr. Cole,

47:42.010 --> 47:44.450
But i don't want my squad to hear what we're saying.

47:44.510 --> 47:46.510
Finding mr. Voitski so freshly dead

47:46.580 --> 47:48.080
Lessens my confidence in you.

47:48.150 --> 47:49.850
I've been with richard since yesterday,

47:49.910 --> 47:51.110
And i never called anyone. Ask him.

47:51.180 --> 47:53.080
I'm pretty sure you're gonna find voitski's dna

47:53.150 --> 47:54.650
Matches what you found on malik's knife.

47:54.710 --> 47:56.350
He killed the boy,not me.

47:56.410 --> 47:58.610
I don't doubt that. In fact,we may find

47:58.680 --> 48:00.380
That voitski killed everyone from fireproof.

48:00.450 --> 48:02.450
But he wasn't acting on his own accord.

48:02.510 --> 48:04.210
He was taking an order from somebody.

48:04.280 --> 48:06.080
Whether it was the c.I.A.'S mole

48:06.150 --> 48:07.350
Or the army of allah.

48:07.410 --> 48:08.310
I am not a traitor.

48:08.380 --> 48:10.010
Even so,voitski's yet another person

48:10.080 --> 48:13.780
From your dwindling-- Woman: excuse me.

48:13.850 --> 48:15.550
Your dwindling circle of acquaintances

48:15.610 --> 48:18.050
Whom we have to talk about in the past tense.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.050
Brenda: tell me,mr. Cole,

48:25.110 --> 48:27.350
After you were fired,did you meet with malik again?

48:27.410 --> 48:29.780
To tell him that there would be no deal with the c.I.A.

48:29.850 --> 48:31.380
And that his life was in danger?

48:31.450 --> 48:34.350
Is that why he carried a kitchen knife in his pocket?

48:36.280 --> 48:37.980
I felt that the army of allah might find out about him,

48:38.050 --> 48:39.510
And i wanted to warn him.

48:39.580 --> 48:41.310
That warning may have cost malik his life.

48:41.380 --> 48:44.350
This is where i get off.

48:44.410 --> 48:46.350
Wait for me downstairs with elaine.

48:46.410 --> 48:48.210
Ms. Johnson.

48:48.280 --> 48:51.510
I was wondering if anyone from our end

48:51.580 --> 48:53.310
Had spoken to you about the investigation,

48:53.380 --> 48:54.310
Besides andrew.

48:54.380 --> 48:56.680
No,they haven't.

48:56.750 --> 48:58.180
Ok. Me,either.

48:58.250 --> 49:01.080
I was just... just wondering.

49:11.110 --> 49:12.410
I think you need to find someone else

49:12.480 --> 49:15.050
To finish up this job.

49:15.110 --> 49:17.380
Brenda,you surprise me.

49:17.450 --> 49:20.210
I moved as quickly as possible

49:20.280 --> 49:21.880
To give you what you said you needed.

49:21.950 --> 49:23.180
Voitski may have been murdered

49:23.250 --> 49:25.350
Because the wrong people found out i was helping you,

49:25.410 --> 49:27.510
And from here on out,they'll be watching me,

49:27.580 --> 49:29.010
Just like they watched larry cole

49:29.080 --> 49:30.380
Until they took him to malik,

49:30.450 --> 49:31.780
And just like they watched malik

49:31.850 --> 49:33.580
Until he took them to his friend.

49:33.650 --> 49:35.980
You discovered how they were following the boy?

49:39.310 --> 49:41.210
Is that a transmitter?

49:41.280 --> 49:42.950
I found it in malik's flashlight.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.680
But they probably had some transmitters

49:45.750 --> 49:47.310
Imbedded in his shoes as well.

49:47.380 --> 49:48.810
You were right,andrew.

49:48.880 --> 49:50.750
Malik's murder was a mistake.

49:50.810 --> 49:52.480
They could have killed him ages ago,

49:52.550 --> 49:54.280
But the army of allah wanted him alive

49:54.350 --> 49:56.550
So they could follow him to his friend.

49:56.610 --> 49:57.880
They used him.

49:57.950 --> 50:00.510
Now they'll be using me.

50:01.680 --> 50:03.280
Brenda,do you remember what to do

50:03.350 --> 50:05.880
When you discover you're under surveillance?

50:06.910 --> 50:08.680
Never acknowledge you're being watched

50:08.750 --> 50:10.880
Unless you can derive some tactical advantage.

50:10.950 --> 50:12.880
And if i were to replace you

50:12.950 --> 50:15.980
Because the army of allah knew what you were doing,

50:16.050 --> 50:17.080
I would be--

50:17.150 --> 50:18.910
Acknowledging the surveillance.

50:18.980 --> 50:20.310
And it would stop.

50:20.380 --> 50:22.950
Well,i'm not interested in using lapd officers as bait.

50:23.010 --> 50:25.880
Wouldn't you like to know who's following her?

50:25.950 --> 50:28.380
I would.

50:28.450 --> 50:32.880
There's a way that we might turn this around

50:32.950 --> 50:34.280
To our advantage.

50:34.350 --> 50:38.010
Is there anyone connected with this investigation

50:38.080 --> 50:41.850
That you would really like to question?

51:01.350 --> 51:03.080
Brenda: this might be a fool's errand,

51:03.150 --> 51:05.150
But keep your eyes peeled

51:05.210 --> 51:06.880
For anyone who might be watching me.

51:06.950 --> 51:08.950
And remember,i'm not wearing an ear piece,

51:09.010 --> 51:10.450
So if i don't hear the signal,

51:10.510 --> 51:12.680
I won't know to come out.

51:14.250 --> 51:16.450
[Doorbell rings]

51:18.580 --> 51:20.350
Ru'yah fara?

51:20.410 --> 51:22.080
Yes,but call me rita.

51:25.610 --> 51:29.750
My son was hoping to play in the warsaw competition next month.

51:35.350 --> 51:36.880
Michael wasn't running away from home.

51:36.950 --> 51:39.910
He was coming back from piano lesson.

51:41.110 --> 51:42.880
He must have gotten on the wrong bus.

51:42.950 --> 51:44.710
You called malik michael?

51:44.780 --> 51:48.780
Michael is a less confusing name for americans.

52:00.310 --> 52:02.480
The other man who came by...

52:02.550 --> 52:04.980
Detective mchale,

52:05.050 --> 52:08.850
He said that maybe my son might be a terrorist.

52:08.910 --> 52:11.150
Or a suicide bomber.

52:12.150 --> 52:14.610
But this isn't true.

52:14.680 --> 52:17.110
Michael's father was an important journalist,

52:17.180 --> 52:19.510
Shot to death for promoting peace.

52:19.580 --> 52:21.050
Michael would never associate himself

52:21.110 --> 52:22.280
With his father's murderers.

52:22.350 --> 52:26.780
He...he worshipped his father's memory.

52:26.850 --> 52:29.450
And you're from lebanon,right?

52:29.510 --> 52:30.850
Yes,beirut.

52:30.910 --> 52:34.650
I came here after my husband was assassinated.

52:36.810 --> 52:39.410
The other scrapbooks,they were before he was born,

52:39.480 --> 52:43.250
But the 2 on top,it's all my son.

52:43.310 --> 52:44.610
Look at this face,

52:44.680 --> 52:47.210
And then tell me that my son was a terrorist.

52:53.710 --> 52:55.180
Look at them.

52:55.250 --> 52:56.610
Please.

53:07.450 --> 53:10.480
That's their third time around the block,lieutenant.

53:10.550 --> 53:12.780
I got it. You copy,sanchez?

53:12.850 --> 53:14.910
Copy that.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.180
Flynn: get ready to signal the chief.

53:27.210 --> 53:30.510
I haven't done anything with michael's room.

53:30.580 --> 53:32.350
It still feels like...

53:32.410 --> 53:34.710
Like he might come back.

53:34.780 --> 53:38.180
Do you know if michael had any friends or...

53:38.250 --> 53:40.210
Was he dating anyone that you know of?

53:40.280 --> 53:41.880
He had time for nothing but the piano.

53:41.950 --> 53:44.680
He practiced constantly.

53:50.310 --> 53:52.710
Michael was going to warsaw,you said?

53:52.780 --> 53:54.580
Did he have his airline ticket and his passport?

53:54.650 --> 53:56.410
Yes,of course.

54:02.680 --> 54:04.850
Can i see it,please?

54:06.310 --> 54:09.750
I don't,uh,know exactly where they are,

54:09.810 --> 54:11.380
Um,this minute.

54:11.450 --> 54:13.880
Really?

54:13.950 --> 54:17.850
What county was michael a citizen of,technically?

54:17.910 --> 54:19.680
Lebanon.

54:23.050 --> 54:25.110
Do you know anything about these teddy bears?

54:25.180 --> 54:26.550
Excuse me?

54:26.610 --> 54:28.080
There's an awful lot of teddy bears

54:28.150 --> 54:30.180
On the bottom of your son's closet.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.410
Not the kind of thing a 16-Year-Old boy normally has.

54:32.480 --> 54:35.380
They are a kind of joke between michael and angela carter.

54:35.450 --> 54:37.010
Angela carter? Who's she?

54:37.080 --> 54:39.380
She's the daughter of michael's piano teacher.

54:39.450 --> 54:40.780
She plays the flute.

54:40.850 --> 54:42.310
Michael was helping her with the concerto.

54:42.380 --> 54:43.950
And how do the bears figure into that?

54:44.010 --> 54:46.180
When angela played especially well,

54:46.250 --> 54:47.380
Michael would give her a bear.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.110
And when she didn't,

54:49.180 --> 54:50.510
She gave him one.

54:50.580 --> 54:51.880
[Chuckles]

54:51.950 --> 54:54.810
Looks like this angela carter was a little hard on herself.

54:58.580 --> 55:00.850
Flynn: here they come,sanchez. Go!

55:03.910 --> 55:05.050
This angela carter,

55:05.110 --> 55:07.050
Could i have her contact information,please?

55:07.110 --> 55:09.110
And if i could borrow your scrapbooks for a few days,

55:09.180 --> 55:10.780
Going through them might help me figure out

55:10.850 --> 55:12.280
Why your son was shot to death.

55:12.350 --> 55:13.980
And a large trash bag,that would be very helpful.

55:14.050 --> 55:15.410
As soon as possible,please.

55:15.480 --> 55:17.050
Thank you.

55:32.210 --> 55:33.980
Go,go,go,go,go,go!

55:35.480 --> 55:39.580
Police!

55:39.650 --> 55:42.350
Driver,turn off the engine,now!

55:42.410 --> 55:44.050
Hands,let's see your hands!

55:44.110 --> 55:45.350
Let's see your hands!

55:45.410 --> 55:46.410
Don't move!

55:46.480 --> 55:48.250
Passenger side,hey! Lapd.

55:48.310 --> 55:51.810
Open the car door,and let us see your hands.

55:51.880 --> 55:53.850
Let's go! Open 'em. Slowly,easy!

55:53.910 --> 55:55.610
Back door,too. Come on,open up.

55:58.080 --> 55:59.650
There. He's coming out!

55:59.710 --> 56:03.110
Flynn: put your hands where we can see them.

56:03.180 --> 56:04.780
Man: driver,do not move.

56:04.850 --> 56:06.210
Clear the vehicle!

56:07.310 --> 56:08.250
Chief.

56:08.310 --> 56:09.780
Flynn: do it now!

56:09.850 --> 56:12.650
Man: hold your positions!

56:14.810 --> 56:17.180
Chief? Chief?

56:26.300 --> 56:27.630
Brenda: you already know this,

56:27.700 --> 56:29.430
But i'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the lapd,

56:29.500 --> 56:31.730
And i feel we ought to have a little chat.

56:31.800 --> 56:32.730
Please,i am a doctor.

56:32.800 --> 56:34.730
My patient needs his medicine.

56:34.800 --> 56:35.800
Please?

56:35.860 --> 56:38.260
[Wheezing]

56:38.330 --> 56:40.930
[Air hissing]

56:50.460 --> 56:54.160
Ms. Johnson,i offer you peace.

56:54.230 --> 56:55.960
What's your name?

56:56.030 --> 56:58.100
Abdul al-Fulani.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.030
And why are you watching me?

57:00.100 --> 57:01.530
Your tone is disrespectful,

57:01.600 --> 57:03.100
And i do not like women with questions.

57:03.160 --> 57:05.830
Well,you can dislike me all the way through your answers,sir.

57:05.900 --> 57:08.030
I hate to take you downtown.

57:08.100 --> 57:09.900
It might mean separating you from your physician,

57:09.960 --> 57:11.960
Whom you seem to need.

57:12.030 --> 57:14.660
So,why are you watching me?

57:14.730 --> 57:16.130
I'm not watching you.

57:16.200 --> 57:19.300
I'm in america observing an empire on its death bed,

57:19.360 --> 57:22.630
A tourist doing charitable work among the addicted

57:22.700 --> 57:25.030
And sexually diseased.

57:25.100 --> 57:27.330
So you're not a member of the army of allah?

57:27.400 --> 57:29.130
I avoid politics.

57:29.200 --> 57:31.830
What do you know about malik fara?

57:31.900 --> 57:33.560
Why were you pursuing him?

57:33.630 --> 57:35.430
I did not pursue him,ms. Johnson.

57:35.500 --> 57:37.430
I'm a spiritual man,

57:37.500 --> 57:40.030
Devoted to spreading the teachings of muhammad.

57:40.100 --> 57:42.160
A blessing of peace be upon him.

57:42.230 --> 57:44.900
[Speaking arabic]

57:46.630 --> 57:49.060
And this boy,this malik,

57:49.130 --> 57:51.700
He is not the child i ever attempted to engage.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.960
You're more interested in someone like voitski,

57:54.030 --> 57:56.060
Spiritually?

57:58.360 --> 58:00.230
I could just arrest you.

58:00.300 --> 58:01.300
On what charge?

58:01.360 --> 58:03.700
Criticizing america?

58:03.760 --> 58:06.460
What other crime have i committed?

58:06.530 --> 58:09.030
But by all means,arrest me.

58:09.100 --> 58:13.560
Dispossess yourself of all your laws

58:13.630 --> 58:15.630
And so-Called freedoms.

58:15.700 --> 58:18.460
I will be twice the winner in that contest.

58:18.530 --> 58:19.600
[Coughing]

58:19.660 --> 58:24.000
If you turn down your own house to prosecute me,

58:24.060 --> 58:25.130
[Coughing] i rejoice.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.460
[Wheezing]

[Air hisses]

58:43.300 --> 58:45.360
Look,doctor.

58:46.330 --> 58:47.730
If i need to speak with you again,

58:47.800 --> 58:49.300
How would i get in touch with you?

58:49.360 --> 58:50.700
I'm listed in the phone book.

58:50.760 --> 58:52.600
Come and see me whenever you like.

58:52.660 --> 58:55.530
And understand this,too,ms. Johnson,

58:55.600 --> 58:59.430
Allah is not your enemy.

58:59.500 --> 59:01.530
I know that,sir.

59:01.600 --> 59:03.100
You are.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.300
Thank you,buzz.

59:06.360 --> 59:08.000
If you could wait outside for a minute,please.

59:08.060 --> 59:10.030
Yes,ma'am.

59:16.160 --> 59:17.900
[Door closes]

59:19.060 --> 59:22.000
So,i see it.

59:22.060 --> 59:25.860
This malik was real,larry cole was right,

59:25.930 --> 59:29.200
And i was very,very wrong.

59:29.260 --> 59:31.060
Now,what can i do to fix this?

59:31.130 --> 59:33.830
Oh. Analyze all the information i've given you

59:33.900 --> 59:35.260
And tell me a story.

59:35.330 --> 59:36.660
Ok,fine.

59:36.730 --> 59:40.660
First,you think voitski might have been killed

59:40.730 --> 59:43.300
By his employers inside the army of allah?

59:43.360 --> 59:45.000
You don't? No.

59:45.060 --> 59:47.160
You told me his wound was dressed

59:47.230 --> 59:49.700
And sewn up with dissolvable stitches,

59:49.760 --> 59:51.230
Yet there were no knife wounds reported at the hospitals

59:51.300 --> 59:52.660
On the night he was attacked.

59:52.730 --> 59:54.560
So you think abdul al-Fulani's doctor took care of him?

59:54.630 --> 59:57.100
Why would they treat voitski if they were only gonna kill him?

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.360
So if i were telling the story of voitski's death,

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.230
I would look for someone

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.930
Who had a really good reason to kill him.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.330
Malik's friend inside the army of allah.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.730
Voitski was shooting at him,

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.730
And one really good way to get voitski to stop that--

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.830
Would be to shove an ice pick in his head.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.830
Always,always works.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:17.230
What can you tell me about abdul al-Fulani here?

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.430
66,bad health,

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.400
Member of a wealthy jordanian family.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.000
He's been living in the united states for the last 7 years,

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.730
As he said,representing islamic charities.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.930
I had no idea he'd gone blind

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.660
Or that he was positively connected to the army of allah.

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:35.200
Honestly,we never considered abdul that important.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.430
Why do you suppose abdul would tell me

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.830
That he did not try to engage malik.

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.330
Well,instead of sneaking people into the country,

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.860
Army of allah tries recruiting disaffected americans.

01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:48.830
Abdul was telling you malik was not one of those kids.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.630
But why would he be giving me a hand?

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.460
Must think he's gonna find out

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:54.300
Who malik's friend was right after you do.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.330
[Scoffs]

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.000
And the boy was using these stuffed animals

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.200
To communicate with his new buddy?

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.830
Mm-Hmm.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.530
It's a shame for us malik's friend

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.160
Won't be looking for him anymore.

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:06.560
Yeah,still.

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.460
He might be useful,you never know.

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:11.160
Anything else i can do? I'm just sitting here.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:15.930
Here are the scrapbooks i got from malik's mother.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.600
If you could go through them carefully,

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.700
See if you recognize a face,an eyebrow,a scar.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.400
Use that fantastic memory of yours

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:27.230
To find someone inside the army of allah i can connect to malik.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.300
My fantastic memory.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.560
Well,i'll do what i can.

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.630
Although,just stating the obvious,

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.360
I don't seem to be as good at all this as i used to be.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.560
We haven't found malik's friend,

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.960
But we have narrowed down the list

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:45.460
On this database a little.

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:48.560
First i eliminated everyone under 6 feet.

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:50.030
Then i knocked out everyone without 2 legs.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.100
Men too old to run.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.560
How many possibilities are we down to?

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:55.230
14,762.

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:57.360
Oh. Approximately.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.860
Ok,what if we dropped everyone who couldn't

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:01.460
Have been in l.A. The night of the murder?

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:02.800
Well,to factor that in,

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.600
We'd need some real-Time surveillance

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.130
And customs data.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.930
Now,we could get it from the terrorist information network,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.300
But we'd need to know someone really,really helpful

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.930
At the fbi to get our hands on it.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.330
Hey,chief. I did that background check

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.800
On malik's mother,rita fara,age 35--

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.030
Young to have a kid malik's age.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.360
Anyway,17 years ago,rita fled from lebanon to germany

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:25.830
As a political refugee.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:28.500
And in 1993,she immigrated to the united states

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.760
With malik and about $500,000 in her bank account.

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:33.930
And she still has some money laying around.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.030
So malik was born in germany.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.660
Maybe he's a kraut.

01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:38.900
No. No!

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.600
Germany doesn't determine citizenship

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.730
By birth or residency,only by bloodline.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.330
Still? Yeah.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.960
Really?

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:50.000
Uh,chief. I have that flute player,angela carter,

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.930
In interview room one. You want to talk to her?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.760
Yes. Thank you.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.300
I don't really know anything about the murder.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.530
Of course not.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.300
We're just trying to get a better picture of malik.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.160
You practiced with him?

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:08.500
Uh,as much as i could.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.360
He was an amazing player.

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:12.530
My father's a concert pianist

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.360
And he teaches a very,very few people.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:19.230
Your father was getting malik ready to go to warsaw?

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.960
Malik wanted to go,but...

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:23.500
But what?

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.300
His stupid mother rita. Have you met her?

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.660
She kept begging him not to compete.

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.500
It drove my father crazy.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.060
I mean,how else is malik supposed to get noticed?

01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:35.500
And his mother was actually blocking him

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.660
From going to warsaw.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.200
How was she blocking him?

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.630
Malik doesn't...

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.100
Didn't have a passport.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.760
And his mother wouldn't let him apply

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:49.300
To the lebanese embassy to get one.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.900
It's really unfair.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.500
Rita is such a bitch.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.830
Have you seen her?

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.500
She has this dyed blonde hair

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.960
And she wears cosmetic contacts.

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:00.700
She's obsessed with blending in.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.930
Once after recital,malik introduced her as his mother,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.530
And she actually took a step back,

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.360
Like she was ashamed of him.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:09.460
And she is such a liar.

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:12.030
Malik said she used to lie about everything.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.800
He hated her.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.930
But despite malik's mother,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.700
He found another way to get a passport.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.900
Is that it?

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.030
Uh...no.

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.900
I mean,he never said anything to me about that.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.030
Someone was helping malik get a u.S. Passport,angela.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.900
Really?

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:45.500
Does this mean anything to you?

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.830
Uh...malik told me never to talk about it.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.830
That if i did... if the wrong people found out,

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:03.730
That i had helped him,then i might be in danger.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.430
We're not the wrong people.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.960
And you're in danger,anyway,angela.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:09.600
Even more so,if you don't tell us what happened.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.100
Ma--

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.630
Malik told me he had met someone,

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:17.230
Who was going to help him become an american citizen.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.600
But that it hadn't really worked out.

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:23.860
So they were gonna maybe go to canada.

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:29.030
And that he needed some way to communicate

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:36.000
With this friend secretly. So he would...he...

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:39.200
He would open up the bear,put a message inside,

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.730
Close it up again,and pass it off to you?

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:46.030
And you handed the bear off to a person?

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:49.700
No,i--I never met anyone,ever.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.460
I would just the next day after school,

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.730
I would...i would drop it off,

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.030
Or see if anything had been left for me.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.600
I never saw anyone,even once.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.100
And where did you pick up and leave the bear?

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.200
There's a church down on fairfax

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.330
In between santa monica and sunset.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.160
I would leave the bear between the prayer books,

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:13.230
In the fifth pew from the door on the left.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.960
Thank you,angela.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.000
Take sanchez and check out that church.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.360
Maybe one of the priests,

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:22.900
Or the rector,or the pope found

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.460
A teddy bear there once and put it in the lost and found.

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:25.730
I'm on it.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.900
Chief. Yes?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.030
Elaine says elaine's found something.

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:34.660
These are the scrapbooks she told you were unimportant?

01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:38.560
The pictures of rita fara taken before malik was born...

01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:39.960
You recognize someone in it?

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.630
No. I recognize some place.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.200
Look what elaine has found.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.500
Provenza would like to look,too.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.660
Rita fara is not from beirut.

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:50.800
She's not even from lebanon.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.300
Rita fara is from amman,jordan.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.990
Ahh! Oh,for goodness' sake.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.760
[Sighs]

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.390
[Knock on door] hmm!

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.420
You're being paged and you're not answering.

01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:45.620
Andrew.

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:46.890
He'd like an update.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.060
Oh. I can't give him one.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.160
Why?

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.960
I'm having trust issues. With andrew?

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:54.860
...who didn't tell me everything.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.460
Like malik's mother who lied about being from lebanon.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.660
Larry cole,elaine donahue who never trusted each other

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.320
With richard branch,who never trusted them.

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:03.920
In fact,the only person going out of their way

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:05.420
To be helpful might be a terrorist.

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:10.190
So this terrorist guy,abdul al-Fulani,he was helpful?

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.520
Which means that he's confident that anything i discover,

01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:14.660
He's going to find out about it in a hurry. Which means...

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.260
You've got trust issues.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.890
Some of which i am hoping that rita fara will help me solve.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.660
I've sent a black and white to pick her up.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.319
So could you stall andrew for me? Please.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.220
Brenda. He's from washington,d.C.

01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:28.590
And if there's one thing people from washington,d.C.,

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.220
Tend to recognize,it's stalling.

01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:32.620
I just...i know there's something

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:34.660
In these scrapbooks that i'm missing.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.990
I mean,why would rita fara lie to me about being from jordan?

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.960
And why would someone inside the army of allah

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.120
Want malik to get a u.S. Passport or to go to warsaw?

01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:48.060
I just need more information before i speak to andrew,again.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.460
I know that anxious,crazed look,

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.720
And i know that there are very few words i can say

01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:54.460
That will actually register right now.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.090
So let them be these--

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.660
I am so happy to have you and your squad back at work

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.620
That i am willing to lie to the person

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:05.760
Who made it all possible,if you really need the time.

01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:07.960
And i do. Thank you,will.

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:08.960
Mm-Hmm.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.590
Oh.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.420
If i don't get this right,

01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:14.390
Do you think they'll kick me out again?

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.020
Don't think like that.

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:17.920
So they will.

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:23.189
It's all about the variables.

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:26.120
A computer is just a tool.

01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:30.120
And a tool is only as good as the person using it.

01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:31.120
Boo-Ya!

01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:32.790
Chief.

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:34.990
Its an odd thing to report,but...

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.990
There were no teddy bears in the church.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.490
Yeah,i didn't know quite how to say it.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.420
Oh,shoot. Thank you.

01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:43.689
Lieutenant tao,how are we doing here?

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.390
The abridged version,please.

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.859
When last we saw our heroic database,

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.990
There were 14,762 possibles.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.520
Since then,with the access to

01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:54.260
The terrorists information network,

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.390
Provided by the very,very special agent howard,

01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:01.490
The identity of malik's friend has been narrowed down to 2,109.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.890
Ahh. That's still too many.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.560
We're waiting on some information from customs.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:07.160
Classified stuff that even agent howard

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.790
Can't access without approval.

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.520
I'll need fewer names to even begin to investigate individuals.

01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:13.020
Thank you. Can i have a moment?

01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:15.020
Right now? I need to speak to rita fara.

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.390
Yeah. Right now.

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:21.060
I'm looking at some of the names here,and,brenda,

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.560
These guys are really dangerous.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.060
And you get into the car with one of them?

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.560
No,not one of them,3 of them,

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.120
But that was only because they were following me.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:28.420
Why are people like this following you?

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.560
Where did this database come from?

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.220
Who got you involved with this?

01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:33.060
Are you really going after terrorists,here?

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.320
I would answer all your questions,

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:36.020
But i signed a confidentiality agreement.

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:37.390
You're trying to reassure me,

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.290
'Cause you're doing a terrible job.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.020
Chief. Just got word from the black and white

01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:42.620
That went to pick up that fara woman...

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:43.960
Oh,tell me she's ok.

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.790
Well,i can't. Looks like she packed up and left.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.920
Ohh,for heaven's sake.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.260
I want to thank you.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.760
How much longer are you going to keep

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.190
Treating my mother like a criminal?

01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:59.490
And after she helped you,too.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.690
Cynthia,i don't need for you to defend me.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.160
There's no reason for you to be here in the first place.

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.190
As far as i'm concerned,y'all can go home.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.020
I'm getting the word today.

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:08.520
If i need you again,i will call you.

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.590
And thank you,elaine. You did help a lot.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:11.790
What? Elaine helped you?

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.690
How'd she help you? I mean,

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.690
Did she get some sort of chance to clear her name?

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.120
Mr. Cohen,my best advice to you

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:17.620
Is to go home and get some rest.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.590
Oh,yeah? What am i resting up for,huh?

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.360
Ms. Johnson,andrew called,

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.190
And he--He seriously wants to speak with you.

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.160
Good. I'll call him when i get a chance.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.660
Elaine.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.920
May i...

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:37.390
May i know how everything turns out or will you...

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.090
Elaine. That's really not my place to say.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.060
She has to protect her sources...and methods.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.920
Can't let the people know her secrets.

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:47.860
Certainly,it's a drill you know,mother.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.960
Cynthia,why can't you ever just wait in the car?

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.160
So if you call,you call.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.160
But i'm cranky,i'm exhausted,and i need to smoke.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.860
Geopolitics,national security,war and peace...

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.660
What's a daughter compared to all that?

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.020
You people never think about the families at all.

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:21.460
So,i was so busy looking for something,

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.220
I didn't notice what was missing.

01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:24.690
Scrapbooks. Scrapbooks. Can i have the scrapbooks?

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.190
Oh,i got 'em right here.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.660
Thank you.

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:35.960
The real story is not what is here,but what isn't.

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:39.490
Where are the pictures of rita's husband?

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.560
She's got all these scrapbooks and no wedding photos.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.990
Not one picture of the father malik worshipped.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.520
Rita wasn't married.

01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:46.890
It would explain why she

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.320
Didn't want her son to get a passport,

01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:50.520
Why she was anxious about being seen

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:51.990
With her son in public.

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:55.520
Why she dyes her hair and wears colored contacts.

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:58.020
She was in disguise most of her adult life

01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:00.160
Hiding from her family.

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:01.490
Gabriel: because she had an illegitimate baby?

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.760
Howard: in jordan,if a woman

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.260
Loses her virginity before marriage,

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.790
Even if she's raped,one of her male relatives

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.320
Kills her to protect the family's honor.

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:11.720
Flynn: you think the guy in the car was malik's father?

01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:13.290
Why else would someone trying to defect

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.990
Reach out to us through malik?

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.660
Make conditions based on malik's needs.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.590
And why hasn't malik's friend tried to contact us?

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.920
Because his reason for defecting is dead.

01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:23.960
It's a guess,lieutenant flynn,

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.560
But an informed one. Let's see what it gets us.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.990
Malik was 16 years old.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:29.860
Let's be conservative and add another 19 years to that.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.660
So knock off everyone on this list under 35 years of age.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.490
And then,let's cross our fingers

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560
And eliminate everyone who wasn't living

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.260
In jordan during that time. How hard is that to do?

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.090
Wait a sec.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.820
Oof. That age thing blew out all but 246.

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:49.490
Now,jordan and the year 1992.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.790
That's going to be big.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.560
Tao: we're down to 8 guys...

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.990
And one of them is...

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.820
Ooh.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.620
This guy look familiar?

01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:06.960
Abdul's physician.

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.360
Dr. Al-Thani.

01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:13.490
Brenda: you trust your doctor with your illness,why not your secrets?

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.460
Flynn: come on. I mean,you think

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.960
Malik's father is gonna see his son

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:17.360
Get shot,then run off and leave?

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.620
He left malik when he was a baby,why not do it again?

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:21.860
The trouble is,if i tried to find evidence

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.360
That proves this...

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.620
Well,you might tip off the wrong people,

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.320
Before you get to this guy.

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:27.790
Brenda: exactly what they're hoping for.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:30.820
But if dr. Al-Thani is the guy

01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:33.290
From the car who was there the night malik was killed,

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.760
Then he knows someone else

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.320
We're looking for. This is our two-Fer.

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:38.860
And abdul did say to come by whenever i wanted.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.420
Oh,but,hey,hey! Whoa,whoa,whoa.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.860
You're gonna go to this nut job terrorist's house?

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.290
Come on. What are you gonna do when you get there?

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.590
You're gonna ask this doctor in front

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.020
Of al-Fulani if he wants to defect with you?

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:52.260
No.

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.960
I'm gonna have malik do it for me.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.490
I'm unused to hosting women to whom i'm not related.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.420
Is it courteous to offer you something to drink?

01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:11.890
I won't be long. I--

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:19.190
Just a tiny follow-Up on our earlier interview.

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:24.590
Because after you and i spoke,ru'yah fara,malik's mother,disappeared.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.620
Were there signs of a struggle?

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.520
No. There were signs of rapidly packed bags,

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:31.490
And she had no reason to be afraid of us.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.390
Not of me,i can assure you.

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.960
As i have told you before,i am a spiritual man who devoted his life--

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:39.720
I know what you are,sir.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.620
I believe that someone inside the army of allah

01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:46.720
Was tryin' to pass some pretty important secrets along

01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:47.860
To the united states government.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.520
Among those secrets was information concerning

01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:52.720
20 pounds of separated plutonium

01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:56.220
And the name of the c.I.A. Officer who helped you get it.

01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:58.220
[Speaking arabic]

01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:01.990
These are the lies told by that infidel boy.

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:03.590
I believe it's true.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.420
Because you wish to be deceived.

01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:07.060
No.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:11.390
Because malik fara speaks from the dead.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:14.290
Well,that is absurd,miss johnson.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.890
And even were it not,

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.720
What is the word of a dead boy

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:19.560
Worth in a court of law?

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:22.290
We'll see.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.760
I need to know where that plutonium is,

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:27.090
And i want to meet the c.I.A. Officer who helped you get it.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.760
And i want you to arrange that meeting as soon as possible,sir.

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.490
Al-Fulani: i'm afraid you and i

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:41.060
Have nothing else to say to each other,miss johnson.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.020
All right,then,sir.

01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:45.620
Good night.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.700
Tao: no sign of him over here.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.600
What about over there?

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:22.170
Flynn: nada.

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.570
The doctor is about an hour late.

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:29.030
Provenza: you know,chief,this may not be the guy.

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.670
He's the guy,and he'll show.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.370
I left explicit instructions inside malik's bear

01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:36.030
Tellin' the doctor exactly what i wanted

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.100
And exactly what i would do if i didn't get it.

01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:40.230
So unless he wants to be arrested for murder

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.330
Tomorrow morning,he'll show.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.600
Everyone but flynn,

01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:45.730
Stay as still as possible.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.270
Flynn: tar pits in the middle of the city.

01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:52.770
And they say l.A. Has no center.

01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:54.970
You know,something's bothering me a little.

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:56.600
What's that,sergeant?

01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:57.930
This whole c.I.A. Thing.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.900
I don't know how much i trust them.

01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:03.200
You know,how i feel about the people who work there,you know?

01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:04.400
I know.

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.000
It's a...gray area.

01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:09.400
I remember once hearing a speech

01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:11.970
About what it meant to be an officer of the c.I.A.,

01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:14.030
And the man who gave this speech

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:17.770
Talked about the struggle to control civilization,

01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.830
And how we're always fighting the same fight.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.100
And he used the dark ages as an example.

01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:26.300
And he talked about how on the one side,

01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:30.200
You had the pragmatic king who was greedy and power hungry

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:33.030
And basically took advantage of people whenever he could.

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:36.330
And on the other side,you had the idealistic church

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.130
Forcin' everyone to follow the same rules,

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.170
Believe the same things,all that.

01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:43.300
Neither the king nor the church

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:45.030
Was ever completely right or wrong.

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:48.570
Both sides ended up doin' terrible things

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:50.770
To get what they wanted.

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:53.870
Really terrible things.

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:57.100
But the point of the story was this--

01:18:57.170 --> 01:19:00.870
That this struggle from the dark ages had been goin' on forever.

01:19:00.930 --> 01:19:03.200
And the church and the king

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:05.170
Might take on different forms and philosophies,

01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:08.170
But that they would always fight each other.

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:10.470
Pragmatists and idealists.

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:12.500
And then most times,

01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:14.030
You're better off standin' on the sidelines

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.930
And lettin' them duke it out.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.800
But every once in a while,

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:21.430
One side or the other

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.370
Decides it might be better to just blow up the whole world,

01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:26.700
Just get its own way.

01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:28.200
And when that happens,

01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:32.170
You can't stand on the sidelines anymore.

01:19:32.230 --> 01:19:34.470
You have to pick a team.

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.600
And so for tonight,anyway,

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:41.930
We're servin' the king.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.930
Gabriel: chief,somebody's comin'.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.800
All right,sergeant.

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:48.270
No one moves until both parties come together.

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:50.630
Uh,here comes the doctor,chief,

01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:53.930
And he's heading right for the bridge.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.430
Keep movin'. Don't look at him.

01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:01.000
Hey,chief,there's somebody else here.

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:03.700
Hold still,everyone. Let them get together.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.430
Hello,doctor.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.870
I gather we're in trouble somehow.

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:24.900
Yes,uh,we are. We all must leave tonight.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.370
Personally,i think we've stayed too long already,

01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:32.270
Especially with voitski getting pinned in the head.

01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:34.170
What about our financial arrangements?

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:36.200
Yes. We have transferred the last $10 million

01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.670
To your swiss bank account.

01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:41.830
Time to enjoy that little villa on the mediterranean,yes?

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.970
Yes. We should move to the exit.

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:45.700
I have transportation for you.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.570
They're moving out,chief.

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:50.830
All right then,go for it.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.100
But be careful. One of them might be armed.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.270
We must hurry. Come.

01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.400
Damn it. Go.

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:07.970
You led me into a trap,you--

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.370
He-He has a gun! He-He has a gun!

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:13.100
He has a gun!

01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:14.600
[Gunshot]

01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:17.530
What was that shot?!

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.700
Gabriel: don't move! Don't move!

01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:20.000
Brenda: what was that shot?!

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:21.930
Don't move. You move,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.670
And it'll be the last thing you do,you understand me?!

01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:25.170
Who's hurt?!

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.170
Is anyone hurt?

01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:29.630
Pat down the doctor.

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.930
We don't want any surprises in the van.

01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:40.000
Flynn: how do you like that? Watch your head.

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:41.600
Spy boy here took a shot at me.

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:42.730
Gabriel: you two-- You two follow us.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.770
Lieutenant flynn,sergeant gabriel?

01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:46.630
Nobody's hit,nobody's hit.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.900
We got him. It's richard branch. We got him.

01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:56.400
All right.

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:58.230
All right,everyone.

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.130
Escort the van back here. Turn off the headpieces.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.800
And,um,buzz,give the doctor your headphones.

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.500
Don't bother arresting me.

01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:15.430
Don't bother reading me my rights.

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.330
My knowledge of the army of allah is extensive

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.930
And the agency would rather i share it than go to jail.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.700
Howard: why not do both?

01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:25.470
We should meet.

01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:28.830
I'm special agent fritz howard of the fbi.

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.400
You're not going back to the agency.

01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:33.600
Provenza: so just shut up and sit very still.

01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:36.300
Brenda: dr. Al-Thani,can you hear me?

01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:39.630
Yes. Is...is...

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.530
Is malik still alive?

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.700
No,sir. He's not.

01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:47.070
I'm sorry. I tried not to mislead you on that point.

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:49.770
And i hate to arrest you,but we don't have much time.

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.530
How much longer before your absence

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.630
Will be noticed at the al-Fulani house?

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.430
Uh,2 hours at the most. I--I must go back.

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.270
No,you can't go back,doctor.

01:22:58.330 --> 01:22:59.630
You can't keep me here!

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.270
Doctor,we've got an awfully good set of prints

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:04.730
From that ice pick that you shoved in voitski's ear.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.430
So if you don't help us,

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.300
I'm going to arrest you for murder.

01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:09.770
Voitski murdered my son!

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:12.230
You killed your son when you ran off and left him.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.430
You actually sewed voitski's leg up

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.270
After he murdered your son!

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:17.800
I had to! There were people there.

01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:19.500
Why--Why did they do this?

01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:22.030
There was no reason to kill malik!

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.930
They made a mistake.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.530
But you can make them pay for it.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:29.670
Or you can spend the rest of your life in an american prison.

01:23:29.730 --> 01:23:31.730
You understand me?

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:34.900
Are you still with me?

01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:38.070
What do you want?

01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:40.730
Do you know where the separated plutonium is?

01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:43.630
Yes,yes.

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.600
It's in hamburg.

01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:47.470
Is it where we can get to it?

01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:49.930
Yes,i can give you the address.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.570
Well,then speak fast,doctor.

01:23:51.630 --> 01:23:53.570
Because the second people know you're gone,

01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:55.930
We lose everything.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.100
The german authorities called. They found the package.

01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:14.930
Oh,that's a relief,anyhow.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.870
Yeah,but you know you haven't exactly played this

01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:19.270
By andrew's rules.

01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:21.500
Oh,i think i got it covered.

01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:22.500
Thanks. Mm-Hmm.

01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:24.070
Good work,everybody.

01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:27.530
Glad to have you back,detective sanchez,

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.700
Lieutenant provenza.

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:30.930
Thank you,chief pope,sir.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.200
[Silly voice] thank you,chief pope,sir.

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:42.470
Glad to have you back,sanchez.

01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:47.530
[Laughter]

01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:59.670
Doctor.

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:03.830
I...

01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:08.670
I heard my son playing in the back of an auditorium.

01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:12.700
After his mother left,i went to meet him.

01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:17.230
It was so beautiful what he could do.

01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:22.930
I was just trying to help him.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.630
Did you ever identify yourself to him as his father?

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.370
Did you ever tell malik why you were trying to help him?

01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:32.970
That's enough. Thank you,gentlemen.

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.600
Brenda? Yeah?

01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:41.030
You went back on your deal.

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.530
I did exactly what you asked.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.530
The germans have the separated plutonium,

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.270
And the fbi has richard.

01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:48.630
And you have dr. Al-Thani.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:51.130
And i'm told that richard branch will be made available

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.930
To your de-Briefers whenever you want him.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.230
Your job was given back to you on the condition--

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.830
Andrew. While i appreciate the agency's assistance,

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.500
Since i've given the fbi full credit

01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:02.200
On a major espionage arrest,

01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:04.100
They're my new best friends.

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:06.500
And i have given you a murderer.

01:26:06.570 --> 01:26:11.070
And you have no idea how hard that is for me to do.

01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:13.600
Pope: look,i think i get what's going on here.

01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:17.100
The c.I.A. Is embarrassed about an intelligence failure...

01:26:17.170 --> 01:26:19.830
Again. They're used to it.

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.630
Brenda did her job. You did yours.

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.000
Can't this just be over?

01:26:26.170 --> 01:26:27.930
Yes,well,i've expressed

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.500
The company's official irritation.

01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:35.600
Hmm. It was nice seeing you again,brenda.

01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:39.500
I wish you well. I do. Wish you well.

01:26:39.570 --> 01:26:41.500
You,too,sir.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:48.200
Oh,and if anyone asks you,i was as mad as a hornet.

01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:52.670
Thank you,sir.

01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:55.370
Did i hear the words "good job" in there anywhere?

01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:57.400
Yeah,but it was in code.

01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:59.000
[Chuckles]

01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:18.800
[Nails fall on floor]

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:30.430
I like it right there.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.470
Your picture.

01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:34.400
What you doing,provenza?

01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:36.000
What are you doin' here? It's late!

01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:38.270
Why aren't you home?

01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:39.400
Of course,ideally,you would--

01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:41.600
You know,you'd hang it up right now

01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:43.630
And put it back where it belongs,

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.100
Or pragmatically,you might just set it down on the floor.

01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:49.070
But you see,your instinct is to split the difference

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:52.330
So that even if it's not perfectly placed,

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.130
You can still see it.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.100
Aren't you tired?

01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:58.170
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:58.230 --> 01:27:59.470
But i hadn't been here in a while,

01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:02.470
And,i don't know. I kind of missed the place.

01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:05.800
Plus,before he left tonight,flynn piled up my desk

01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:08.700
With every coffee cup in the joint,old case files.

01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:10.970
I think he even brought a little trash from his house.

01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:15.430
So i just thought,that before i cleaned it up,

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.470
I might,uh...

01:28:17.530 --> 01:28:19.430
Take you out to breakfast.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.230
You know someplace fast and cheap?

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.170
Fast and cheap is my specialty.

01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:25.530
So come on.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.400
Let's grab a bite to eat,and then when we get back,

01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:30.970
I'll hang your picture up so you don't go nuts.

01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:34.500
Well,how can i refuse an invitation like that?

01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:36.700
Just give me one second.

01:28:39.530 --> 01:29:06.530
