Everyone has a morning routine.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.500
For a doctor like Bow,

00:05.500 --> 00:06.960
that routine
used to start early.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.040
Farmer early.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.620
She got dressed in the dark
so I could sleep,

00:13.620 --> 00:15.670
which is something
I would have done for her.

00:15.670 --> 00:17.290
Probably.

Maybe.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.830
She left way before
the kids got up,

00:35.830 --> 00:38.120
but she did what she could
in order to see them.

mornings were my thing,

01:02.210 --> 01:04.580

at my thing.

is how you're gonna
go to school!

01:15.960 --> 01:18.290
You can be late.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.120
But now that Bow

01:20.120 --> 01:21.380
was home full time

You're leaving cheese
in a hot car all day long?

Didn't think it through.

four months early

and putting traps out
for that gopher

that's been tearing up
our yard.

I'm really busy

doing all the stuff
I've been, like, dying to do

for the last 18 years.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.080
An affair?
Plastic surgery?

03:31.080 --> 03:32.790
Telling your father
you deserved to be loved?

03:32.790 --> 03:34.830
The reason
that I stopped working

is not to do yoga.

03:35.670 --> 03:37.000
It was actually --

03:37.000 --> 03:38.830
I just really want to spend time
with my kids, so...

03:38.830 --> 03:40.080
Well, of course.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.460
That's why I took a break
from neurosurgery

her law firm.

03:42.670 --> 03:43.830

Oh.

03:43.830 --> 03:45.620
But you need to make time
for self-care.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.960
When I first started at home,
I tried to do everything,

03:47.960 --> 03:50.290

heart attack in Whole Foods.

You don't want to end up

twitching on the floor
of the kombucha aisle,

Ours is based on that.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.620
I, too, had the morning
to myself.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.920
Had poached eggs on toast
at home,

04:34.920 --> 04:38.790
visited an ATM,
took a spin class,

just in case
the police ask.

What else -- what else
is she doing for you?

04:52.710 --> 04:54.880
Well, it's more about her
being home for the kids.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.330
Okay, that's just insane,
okay?

04:57.330 --> 04:59.460
The whole point of
keeping your woman at home

is that
she takes care of you.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.420

Like mine --

05:02.420 --> 05:03.830
she cooks my meals for me,

05:03.830 --> 05:05.380
she keeps a spotless toilet,

05:05.380 --> 05:08.170
and she does it all
in a sexy maid outfit.

05:08.170 --> 05:10.540
That's because
she's your maid.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.880
Was my maid.

I promoted her to wife.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.210

05:15.210 --> 05:17.210
is I don't
have to pay her anymore.

05:17.210 --> 05:18.540
Yeah, Dre, my lady,

05:18.540 --> 05:20.250

fold my laundry,
take me to karate --

selling incense

What are you
talking about?

16:59.250 --> 17:01.790
I can't keep making fun
of Mason with you.

17:01.790 --> 17:02.880
What, because he cried?

17:02.880 --> 17:05.500
We toughened him up.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.380
Imagine if I was able
to taunt you at his age.

17:08.380 --> 17:10.750
You'd be captain
of the football team.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.120
Or dead.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.460
Either way, a full page
in the yearbook.

17:14.460 --> 17:17.540
I appreciate that,
but it's over, Diane.

17:17.540 --> 17:20.670
I've already apologized
to Mason and his family

17:20.670 --> 17:23.790
and taught his mom
how to use Excel.

17:23.790 --> 17:26.080
But I hope you and I can find
something else in common.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.670
Choke on it, weirdo.

17:28.670 --> 17:34.330

17:37.420 --> 17:39.170
I don't know why
I'm supposed to feel bad

17:39.170 --> 17:40.750
for asking her
to do more around the house.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.080
She's home.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.290
I'm gonna tell you
a very wise thing

17:44.290 --> 17:46.500
my father and three of my uncles
told me.

17:46.500 --> 17:51.170
When a long-term marriage
hits a snag, bounce.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.670
What? No.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.790
Dre, thank you.

17:54.790 --> 17:56.920
I took your advice,
and I switched to Nest

17:56.920 --> 18:01.080
so I can track my maid --
my wife -- all day long.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.290
Hey, that's not
what I told you to do.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.960
No, no, no, you're right.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.460
Our wives need to be held
accountable for their days.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.670
That's not
what I was saying.

18:08.670 --> 18:11.000
Look, when we're here
and they're there,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.790
they need to be
as productive as we are.

18:12.790 --> 18:15.670
Oh, guys, by the way,
massages at 4:00 today.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.580
I don't need her
to be accountable.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.750
I just want her to do the things
I want her to do

18:19.750 --> 18:21.790
when I want her to do them.

18:21.790 --> 18:24.000
Oh, my God.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.420
I'm you.

18:25.420 --> 18:28.830
Mm, with, uh...
one important difference.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.170
Are you eating my lunch?

18:33.170 --> 18:35.000
Does it look --

I shouldn't be sitting.
Bow.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.290
I haven't
earned my break yet.
Bow.

18:48.290 --> 18:50.710
No, no, no,
I will go get a pencil

18:50.710 --> 18:52.920
and I will write down
your breakfast order.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.040
Babe, babe.
So, ye-- Oh.

Sit down, please.
Sure.

18:56.080 --> 18:59.920
Do some laundry

18:59.920 --> 19:02.290
I just want to say that

I'm sorry I got all crazy.

19:04.790 --> 19:07.330
It's just that
when you said you'd stay home,

19:07.330 --> 19:09.670
I didn't expect it
to be like this.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.250
Obviously.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.920
To tell the truth,

19:12.920 --> 19:14.210
I spent all my time

19:14.210 --> 19:15.580
imagining
what you being home

19:15.580 --> 19:17.080
would be like
for me and the kids

19:17.080 --> 19:18.380
and not what it would be like
for you.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.790
Sweetheart,
this is the first break

19:23.790 --> 19:25.710
that I have had

19:25.710 --> 19:27.170
in 18 years.

19:27.170 --> 19:28.330
I know.

19:28.330 --> 19:30.420
So maybe I got a little,

19:30.420 --> 19:32.420
you know,
high on the free time,

19:32.420 --> 19:34.290
went a little --
little overboard,

19:34.290 --> 19:37.880
but...it's gonna balance out
eventually.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.460
And I'm gonna have to learn
to roll with it.
Yeah.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.670
But it's gonna
take a minute.
Okay.

19:43.670 --> 19:45.620
And I know you're used to me
being easygoing...

19:47.040 --> 19:49.750
...flexible,
and cool with change, but...

19:51.540 --> 19:53.040
What?
Yes.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.040
You are not the guy
who picketed Subway

19:55.040 --> 19:56.960
when they started
toasting the bread.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.330
Somebody had to stand up
for Quiznos.
Of course.

19:59.330 --> 20:00.750
And Togo's gets no respect.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.040
Right, of course.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.960
But this, I'm cool with.
Okay.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.880
And I would be even cooler

20:06.880 --> 20:08.540
if we could get rid
of that fountain.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.830
Oh.

20:09.830 --> 20:10.920
Fountain's gone.

20:11.790 --> 20:14.040
I was peeing constantly.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.670
Hey, did you send me
a box of leotards?

20:16.670 --> 20:19.420
What? No.

20:19.420 --> 20:21.500
Oh. So weird.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.420
I didn't order them.
They all fit, though.

20:23.420 --> 20:24.120
Hm.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.460
So Bow found a way

20:29.460 --> 20:30.460
to balance her self-care
with childcare.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.120
Then what did you say?

20:32.120 --> 20:33.880
I said, "Get out."
Good for you.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.540
Yeah.
Good for you!

20:35.540 --> 20:38.210
Don't think of it as
him being out of your life.

20:38.210 --> 20:41.330
Think about it
as you being into yours.

20:41.330 --> 20:42.790
Yeah, you're worth it,
Tina.

20:42.790 --> 20:43.670
Thank you.
So worth it.

20:43.670 --> 20:45.120
You know what?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.960
I will do
the 10-minute foot massage.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.290
That is
such a good call.
Yeah.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.790
Okay, guys.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.460
As soon as we're done here,
we got to go over to soccer.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.580
Diane:

20:52.580 --> 20:54.290
Ooh, you know what?

20:54.290 --> 20:56.830
We really should've done
the mani-pedis

20:56.830 --> 20:58.210
after the game.

20:58.210 --> 20:59.420
Yeah.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.710
I am not putting goalie gloves
over these acrylics.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.210
No.
