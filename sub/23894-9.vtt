00:05.219 --> 00:08.099
<i>Evil's manifested in
many forms over the years.</i>

00:08.185 --> 00:11.907
<i>It's all rooted back to the Master
Demons we called the Dark Ones.</i>

00:12.038 --> 00:13.717
<i>The most ruthless one of them
betrayed the others</i>

00:13.772 --> 00:15.772
<i>and cast them from our world.</i>

00:17.783 --> 00:19.219
The rift.

00:19.350 --> 00:20.829
We believe it's a mystic passage

00:20.960 --> 00:22.831
between the human sphere
and the Deadlands.

00:22.962 --> 00:26.139
If you've talked to dead Kelly,
Brandy's in there too.

00:26.270 --> 00:28.359
All we have to do is get into
that rift, grab them.

00:28.489 --> 00:29.783
Walk away Ray.

00:31.188 --> 00:33.277
Maybe I am in that dead place.

00:33.407 --> 00:35.279
I'm not gonna let evil mess
with our little family.

00:35.409 --> 00:36.976
That includes you too, Kelster.

00:37.803 --> 00:40.501
Something's keeping me from
coming through.

00:40.849 --> 00:42.068
What...

00:43.504 --> 00:45.027
- Kelly?
- She's still down there.

00:45.550 --> 00:47.160
Ghostbeaters never leave a man behind.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.249
The Dark Ones know about the rift.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.251
Their vengeance will be merciless.

00:51.382 --> 00:52.800
We betrayed them Ruby.

00:54.646 --> 00:56.787
You're gonna help us
rewrite our destiny.

01:24.676 --> 01:26.852
We shouldn't be here. We need to run.

01:26.982 --> 01:29.246
The Dark Ones will find us,
wherever we go.

01:29.376 --> 01:31.204
We got to take a stand and fight.

01:31.335 --> 01:32.858
By creating a new page?

01:32.988 --> 01:35.382
Yes. 'Cause this page
will mask the presence

01:35.513 --> 01:37.884
of the Necronomicon from the Dark Ones.

01:38.037 --> 01:39.908
That only delays the inevitable.

01:40.039 --> 01:41.997
It'll get me the time
I need to destroy them.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.372
Give me that pen.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.462
Are you sure this will work?

02:13.420 --> 02:14.878
It has to.

02:23.430 --> 02:24.475
Go get her.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.629
Hail to the Prophesied One

02:48.760 --> 02:51.828
for he will be the Savior of Humanity.

02:53.330 --> 02:55.367
But not your Savior.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.263
- I'm gonna throw up again.
- Oh, Pablo?

03:14.654 --> 03:16.065
Oh.

03:16.698 --> 03:18.746
Oh, why do I feel like this?

03:18.877 --> 03:21.923
Ah, I know the feeling.
It's the residual effects

03:22.054 --> 03:23.664
of coming back from the dead.

03:23.795 --> 03:25.187
Well, how come he's not sick, then?

03:25.318 --> 03:26.624
I don't get hangovers either.

03:26.754 --> 03:28.283
I'm so sorry Dad.

03:28.582 --> 03:29.714
And Pablo,

03:29.844 --> 03:31.890
it's my fault that Kelly's dead.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.631
If I'd just believed you
from the beginning,

03:33.761 --> 03:34.762
- none of this...
- It's not your fault. It's Ruby's.

03:34.893 --> 03:36.242
She's the one who got in your head.

03:36.373 --> 03:37.765
I can't believe that Kelly's gone.

03:38.073 --> 03:40.333
You know of all of us, I thought
she'd be the one to make it.

03:40.464 --> 03:41.900
This doesn't make any sense.

03:42.030 --> 03:43.597
You and I were both
there with her at the rift,

03:43.728 --> 03:45.347
then all of a sudden,
it's like there was a wall.

03:45.448 --> 03:47.384
- I couldn't save her.
- What are we gonna do now?

03:47.993 --> 03:52.288
Christ. First Linda,
then Cheryl, Chet, Pop

03:52.650 --> 03:54.085
- then Pablo...
- I'm not dead.

03:54.171 --> 03:55.609
You were. Kelly...

03:55.740 --> 03:57.390
- And me.
- Yeah, my daughter too.

03:57.481 --> 03:58.917
Come on, enough is enough.

03:59.047 --> 04:00.962
I'm going to find this Ruby
and put an end to this...

04:01.093 --> 04:02.355
Once and for all!

04:02.486 --> 04:04.452
Ah, you know what?
This time, I'm serious.

04:05.053 --> 04:06.707
Hey, what are you doing?

04:06.838 --> 04:08.319
I don't think this is a good idea.

04:08.390 --> 04:11.086
Ruby is a Dark One with
the Necronomicon.

04:11.173 --> 04:13.610
We cannot lose you t... Whoa...

04:13.741 --> 04:14.872
What's the matter with you?

04:14.927 --> 04:17.178
<i>Jefe</i>, I can't see.

04:17.309 --> 04:18.223
Come here.

04:18.353 --> 04:20.529
- My eyes... <i>Jefe</i>.
- Hey, it's okay. Take it easy.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.793
My, my... I'm blind. <i>Jefe</i>!

04:22.924 --> 04:24.926
- You're gonna be okay.
- What's happening to me?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.275
Just take it easy.

04:31.846 --> 04:33.662
Wait. Where am I?

04:33.891 --> 04:36.459
- You're right here with us.
- No. I'm in another house.

04:37.895 --> 04:39.723
There's blood on the floor.

04:39.854 --> 04:40.855
I can see a body.

04:41.420 --> 04:42.596
Zoe?

04:42.726 --> 04:44.604
Wait. There's somebody else...

04:46.121 --> 04:47.383
- Kelly.
- Kelly?

04:51.256 --> 04:53.128
There's someone else inside of her body.

04:53.258 --> 04:54.956
<i>Jefe</i>, that's why Kelly
couldn't come through

04:55.086 --> 04:56.174
the rift with you and Brandy.

04:56.305 --> 04:58.220
Her soul doesn't have
a body to come back to.

05:01.832 --> 05:02.877
I can see Ruby!

05:04.278 --> 05:05.864
<i>Aye dios mio Jefe.</i>

05:06.010 --> 05:07.882
I'm seing through the eyes
of the Necronomicon.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.177
The Necro-what-o-con?

05:09.255 --> 05:11.233
Oh, it's a gnarly book. It's the
reason behind all this crap.

05:11.363 --> 05:12.626
- Oh, shit.
- Pablo look,

05:12.756 --> 05:14.323
you gotta be connected to it somehow.

05:14.453 --> 05:15.498
Can you see where they are?

05:15.629 --> 05:17.869
Yeah. It's an old house.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.328
Big room.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.548
- There's a fireplace.
- Is there a deer head above it?

05:21.678 --> 05:23.517
Yeah. She went back to Prevett's.

05:23.637 --> 05:26.465
Wait... I can hear them.

05:26.596 --> 05:27.641
Ruby's upset.

05:29.077 --> 05:30.557
She's scared.

05:30.692 --> 05:33.472
She needs to find a rift before
the Dark Ones break through.

05:33.603 --> 05:34.822
Well, that's the rift below the store.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.827
Whoa... I'm back.

05:39.957 --> 05:41.611
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.439
I don't get a manual with
being <i>El Brujo Especial</i>.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.920
Come on. Saddle up.

05:47.791 --> 05:49.488
Get over to the hardware store.

05:49.619 --> 05:51.621
Make sure that rift
is locked down tight.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.970
I don't want any Dark Ones
coming out of there.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.064
Where are you going?

05:54.145 --> 05:56.104
I'm going to get Kelly's body.
See you at the rift.

05:56.234 --> 05:57.714
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

05:57.845 --> 05:59.716
You're too weak to fight.

05:59.847 --> 06:01.805
Now look, my boomstick,

06:01.936 --> 06:03.633
got me out of a lot of scrapes,
but be careful.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.808
It's got a hair trigger.

06:04.939 --> 06:06.114
Kick like a mule.

06:06.244 --> 06:08.159
You stay locked in here.

06:08.290 --> 06:10.509
Do not answer that front door, okay?

06:10.640 --> 06:12.294
No matter how normal they sound.

06:12.424 --> 06:13.512
Dad?

06:19.600 --> 06:20.788
Be careful.

06:25.002 --> 06:26.308
Uh.

06:27.788 --> 06:28.876
- Oh.
- Oh... I'm sorry.

06:29.006 --> 06:31.574
Oh, oh, no. That's... that's okay.

06:31.705 --> 06:32.967
That's okay. We'll, we'll be back soon.

06:34.055 --> 06:35.317
Yeah.

07:00.081 --> 07:01.169
Oh, shit.

07:01.299 --> 07:02.649
Why is it already open?

07:07.262 --> 07:08.524
What's happening?

07:25.646 --> 07:31.224
<i>Guru musein Nguluk an ama.
Ngish da kam lal sier.</i>

07:34.681 --> 07:35.682
Why isn't it closing?

07:40.948 --> 07:43.777
♪ Stormbringer coming ♪

07:45.039 --> 07:47.868
♪ Time to die ♪

07:50.740 --> 07:52.176
Stormbringer's coming alright.

07:52.307 --> 07:53.874
Coming for you Ruby.

07:54.004 --> 07:55.049
Time to die.

08:04.058 --> 08:05.320
The Dark Ones.

08:06.133 --> 08:09.150
<i>Ngish en kelito. Salvar mi alma...</i>

08:11.848 --> 08:12.893
What is it?

08:14.764 --> 08:15.939
They're here...

08:41.269 --> 08:42.443
Why didn't they kill me?

08:51.888 --> 08:53.194
I'll have another one, Frank.

08:54.282 --> 08:55.674
Frank?

09:05.380 --> 09:07.088
What the fuck?!

09:47.465 --> 09:48.684
What's happening?

09:48.815 --> 09:49.990
Go back inside.

09:50.425 --> 09:51.687
Lock your doors!

09:53.123 --> 09:54.566
Oh, fuck.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.589
Is somebody there?

10:39.996 --> 10:41.652
I have a gun.

11:06.936 --> 11:07.981
What is that?

12:29.279 --> 12:30.977
Oh, oh.

12:33.109 --> 12:34.328
Oh, no.

12:34.458 --> 12:35.982
Fuuuuck.

12:39.463 --> 12:41.248
Oh...

12:44.512 --> 12:45.861
No.

12:47.863 --> 12:49.038
No, it isn't you...

13:15.325 --> 13:17.023
Oh, shit. Shit.

13:22.289 --> 13:25.638
<i>You have 3 new messages.</i>

13:27.194 --> 13:29.841
<i>Brandy. Oh, it's Mom.</i>

13:30.379 --> 13:32.060
<i>I don't know what's happening.</i>

13:32.647 --> 13:34.040
<i>I know you're scared honey. But...</i>

13:36.259 --> 13:37.956
<i>I just wanted to tell you...</i>

13:38.682 --> 13:40.792
- <i>I just wanted you to know...</i>
- Mom.

13:41.435 --> 13:42.914
<i>...that you...</i>

13:43.092 --> 13:44.800
<i>taste good.</i>

13:47.316 --> 13:49.144
Somebody help me!

14:03.330 --> 14:04.461
The circle is complete.

14:05.114 --> 14:06.333
How much longer for the page?

14:06.463 --> 14:07.595
It's ready.

14:34.372 --> 14:36.972
<i>Udshuushe ningkaszu ba...</i>

14:37.103 --> 14:38.191
Ruby.

14:39.888 --> 14:40.802
Ash...

14:40.932 --> 14:42.151
Damn straight, Skippy.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.197
Now get the gum out
of your ears and listen up.

14:44.327 --> 14:47.025
Whoever or whatever you put
in my Kelly's body,

14:47.156 --> 14:49.071
has got to take a hike.
'Cause I need it back.

14:49.202 --> 14:50.290
Kelly's dead already.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.378
Here, maybe.

14:51.508 --> 14:52.770
I just saw her in the rift.

14:52.901 --> 14:54.903
She's still kicking evil's ass...

14:55.033 --> 14:56.078
You've been in a rift?

14:56.209 --> 14:57.384
Mm-hm. Got my daughter back.

14:57.514 --> 14:58.646
No thanks to you.

14:58.776 --> 15:00.996
They could not survive. He lies.

15:01.127 --> 15:02.345
Do I?

15:02.476 --> 15:04.608
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

15:04.739 --> 15:06.175
Where is this rift?

15:06.306 --> 15:08.090
- The Dark Ones...
- The Dark Ones, oh, they're coming.

15:08.221 --> 15:09.265
The Dark Ones are here.

15:09.396 --> 15:11.311
And they're coming for the Necronomicon.

15:11.379 --> 15:13.965
Now you tell me where the
rift is, and I can stop them.

15:14.096 --> 15:16.968
- But I need Kaya.
- Oh, Kaya. Who the fuck is Kaya?

15:17.099 --> 15:18.448
The one who's in Kelly's body.

15:18.579 --> 15:20.972
- No you let us...
- Oh, you stop right there, Sugar Lips.

15:21.103 --> 15:23.801
Last time we made a deal, I got
jack shit out of it. Okay?

15:23.932 --> 15:25.020
Stay on point.

15:25.151 --> 15:26.369
I couldn't get Kelly out of the rift,

15:26.500 --> 15:28.806
because her body as a 'no vacancy' sign.

15:28.937 --> 15:31.896
Now are you gonna evict
this Kaya or am I?

15:32.027 --> 15:34.812
You kill Kaya and Kelly's
body goes with it.

15:34.943 --> 15:36.379
And neither of us gets the one we want.

15:36.510 --> 15:38.294
I'm willing to bet
you won't take that chance.

15:38.425 --> 15:39.600
Think you're right.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.255
Join us!

15:55.543 --> 15:58.285
Never bet against the house.

16:46.075 --> 16:47.628
I'm sorry sweetie.

16:47.691 --> 16:51.498
But your call cannot be
completed until you're done.

16:51.628 --> 16:52.760
That's it.

16:53.456 --> 16:56.242
You want me? I'm Ashy Slashy's daughter.

16:57.330 --> 16:59.359
Come on. Come get some!

17:00.376 --> 17:01.551
Whoa!

17:02.258 --> 17:03.562
Ashy Slashy.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.382
Time to talk about
your old man, little girl.

17:06.512 --> 17:07.992
Worthless shit!

17:08.123 --> 17:11.387
Couldn't save me
and he'll never save you.

17:15.748 --> 17:17.175
Behind you.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.569
This what you kids like?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.802
Brandy. Brandy. Hey! What are you doing?

17:34.932 --> 17:36.325
- You're going down.
- Put that down.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.792
Don't even dream about getting
a new phone after this.

17:40.938 --> 17:42.418
You selfish whore.

17:46.030 --> 17:49.860
Brandy, no. Please let me go.

17:49.991 --> 17:51.122
Tell it to the plow.

17:53.299 --> 17:54.387
Brandy?

17:54.517 --> 17:55.997
Who's laughing now?

17:57.085 --> 17:59.000
Brandy...

18:04.614 --> 18:05.746
Brandy!

18:06.290 --> 18:07.980
- Pablo?
- Brandy where are you!

18:08.096 --> 18:09.790
- Brandy?
- I'm here. In the garage.

18:10.954 --> 18:12.318
Brandy!

18:14.494 --> 18:16.792
Oh, shit! Are you okay?

18:17.148 --> 18:18.498
Yeah...

18:18.628 --> 18:20.630
Wait... how do I know it's really you?

18:20.761 --> 18:22.415
It is. I swear. I promise.

18:22.545 --> 18:24.330
Evil has no interest in me.

18:24.460 --> 18:26.201
I... think they think I'm one of them.

18:26.332 --> 18:27.245
But you're not, right?

18:27.376 --> 18:28.508
No, I promise.

18:28.638 --> 18:29.987
One foot in each world, remember?

18:32.120 --> 18:33.600
What the fuck?!

18:33.730 --> 18:34.862
Come on!

18:39.993 --> 18:41.412
Run!

18:47.265 --> 18:48.484
What is happening out there?

18:48.615 --> 18:49.920
The Dark Ones made it through the rift.

18:50.051 --> 18:51.052
They have the lost pages...

18:51.182 --> 18:52.314
We got to find Ash.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.534
You know how to get
to Mrs. Prevett's house?

18:54.664 --> 18:56.405
Outside of town. I think off Mill Road.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.901
What are the lost pages?

18:58.039 --> 19:00.317
If the Dark Ones are joining
with the Necronomicon,

19:00.457 --> 19:02.894
then the "Book of the Dead"
will once again be complete.

19:03.055 --> 19:07.198
The world. Humanity.
Everything, will be doomed.

19:07.329 --> 19:08.896
What the fuck?!

19:19.644 --> 19:21.125
Where's the rift?

19:21.256 --> 19:22.692
I got your rift right here.

19:29.438 --> 19:30.570
What are you doing?

19:32.876 --> 19:35.357
Oh, my God! Not the saw!

19:35.488 --> 19:38.142
Whoa... Oh. Oh, not the blade.

19:42.146 --> 19:43.321
Oh.

19:44.453 --> 19:46.368
Oh. Whoa. Whoa.

19:46.499 --> 19:48.109
You're gonna pay for that!

19:52.287 --> 19:54.202
Tell us where the rift is.

19:54.332 --> 19:55.595
I'm not gonna lie to you.

19:55.725 --> 19:58.511
It's a litte weird having
Kelly doing this to me.

19:58.641 --> 20:03.124
No! No! Not the money brows. Oh, no!

20:03.254 --> 20:04.969
Ruby!

20:05.048 --> 20:06.664
<i>Igi-bala.</i>

20:21.403 --> 20:26.103
<i>Ba ni ak e esit ra.</i>

20:40.817 --> 20:42.163
Kaya.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.536
Go on you bastards!

21:07.667 --> 21:08.798
Take me!

21:10.104 --> 21:11.584
<i>Ar di pour.</i>

21:11.714 --> 21:14.369
Soon you will suffer the same fate.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.198
The "Savior of humanity",
will destroy you all!

21:31.604 --> 21:33.431
Poor Ruby. I'm melting.

21:33.562 --> 21:35.042
Fuck off bitch!

21:39.455 --> 21:43.611
<i>Isk kel camow mrwa.</i>

21:49.821 --> 21:52.494
Ruby dead? Check.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.627
Necronomicon? Check.

21:54.757 --> 21:55.845
Kelly's body?

21:57.499 --> 21:59.426
Don't you worry. I'm coming for you.

22:01.890 --> 22:03.853
Hey Pablo, can you hear me?

22:05.768 --> 22:07.640
It's happening again.

22:07.770 --> 22:10.686
Brandy, take the wheel! Take the wheel!

22:17.367 --> 22:18.716
Oh, shit.

22:18.819 --> 22:21.001
<i>Pablo? Can you hear me?</i>

22:21.069 --> 22:23.082
- Ash?
- Come in, over.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.787
Ash, I can hear you.

22:25.483 --> 22:26.702
What? You see him? Is he okay?

22:26.833 --> 22:27.964
<i>Jefe</i>, can you hear me?

22:28.095 --> 22:31.054
Look, Ruby's dead.
I got the Necronomicon.

22:31.185 --> 22:32.403
I got Kelly.

22:32.534 --> 22:33.535
<i>I'm going to the hardware store.</i>

22:33.666 --> 22:34.971
So get the rift ready.

22:35.102 --> 22:37.578
No! Do not go to the rift, <i>Jefe</i>!

22:38.047 --> 22:40.273
- <i>The rift is open.</i>
- Huh?

22:40.357 --> 22:42.142
<i>Do not go into the rift.</i>

22:42.241 --> 22:43.344
<i>If you can you hear me.</i>

22:43.391 --> 22:45.155
Evil is amongst us.

22:45.286 --> 22:46.548
Do you hear me, <i>Jefe</i> ?

22:49.203 --> 22:51.901
Whoa! What the hell?

22:52.032 --> 22:52.946
Whoa!

22:53.076 --> 22:54.121
Oh, God!

22:54.251 --> 22:55.977
Those were deadites.

22:56.055 --> 22:57.547
What the hell are they doing out here?

22:57.649 --> 22:59.875
<i>We interrupt this program
with an emergency bulletin.</i>

22:59.961 --> 23:01.548
<i>Due to the extensive violent rioting</i>

23:01.625 --> 23:03.149
<i>in the streets of downtown Elk Grove,</i>

23:03.227 --> 23:06.198
<i>the Governor of Michigan has
implemented Marshal Law.</i>

23:06.300 --> 23:08.309
<i>Please stay tuned to this station
for further instructions.</i>

23:08.378 --> 23:09.719
That doesn't sound good.

23:09.765 --> 23:12.835
<i>...Michigan Army Reserves...
...for further information...</i>

23:14.911 --> 23:16.529
- I lost him.
- What did he say?

23:16.630 --> 23:18.188
He's headed to the hardware store.

23:18.319 --> 23:19.929
We gotta get back there.

23:29.722 --> 23:30.766
- Whoa!
- Look out!

23:31.288 --> 23:32.376
Hey! Watch it!

23:36.946 --> 23:38.391
Watch it!

23:43.344 --> 23:44.562
Ohh!

23:50.873 --> 23:52.005
- Dad!
- Wait!

23:55.835 --> 23:57.097
It's the Dark Ones.

24:07.107 --> 24:08.282
We have to help him!

24:08.412 --> 24:10.197
No. I got it. You stay here.

24:24.037 --> 24:25.212
No!

24:27.518 --> 24:28.737
Dad!

24:28.762 --> 24:29.825
Brandy!

24:29.850 --> 24:30.870
What the hell are you doing here?

24:30.895 --> 24:31.914
You gotta get out of here.

24:31.939 --> 24:33.089
No! Not without you.

24:40.620 --> 24:43.065
Oh, no... I gotta stop 'em.

24:59.433 --> 25:01.754
The time has come
to test the mettle of man...

25:03.050 --> 25:06.906
<i>Jefe</i>. The Dark Ones.
They got the Necronomicon!

25:07.036 --> 25:08.211
What?

25:08.695 --> 25:14.039
<i>Ngish shudum Ma zu. Ud me amash.</i>

25:14.117 --> 25:16.306
- What is that?
- Mom, where are you?

25:25.533 --> 25:26.752
Oh, no!

25:26.882 --> 25:27.970
What'd they say?

25:51.777 --> 25:52.865
Whoa!

26:07.096 --> 26:09.533
Stay back!

26:11.579 --> 26:12.667
Watch it!

26:12.798 --> 26:13.755
Don't!

26:13.886 --> 26:14.887
I just want to take a look.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.458
What was that?

27:05.633 --> 27:07.069
Fuuuuuck.
