(upbeat instrumental music)

00:32.054 --> 00:33.956
* Stay

00:33.989 --> 00:37.660
* Follow us for the weekend

00:41.864 --> 00:45.034
* Tall is the ceiling

00:48.337 --> 00:52.507
* In these unforgiving arms
they crawl and go gently *

00:57.913 --> 01:02.051
* Oh they spill *

01:05.319 --> 01:07.156
(laughing)

01:07.189 --> 01:10.059
You can always make me laugh, Matty.

01:10.092 --> 01:12.628
I can be more than funny, you know.

01:12.662 --> 01:13.863
Come on, just one date.

01:13.896 --> 01:15.865
Look, it'll do your
image good to be seen

01:15.898 --> 01:17.733
with the resident nerd.

01:17.767 --> 01:20.936
You're a geek, there's a difference.

01:20.970 --> 01:22.137
In a good way.

01:23.538 --> 01:25.007
What about dinner tonight then?

01:25.040 --> 01:26.976
Aren't you going to Travis's tonight?

01:27.009 --> 01:28.377
Oh.

01:28.410 --> 01:32.114
How about I ride out
to Travis's with you?

01:33.282 --> 01:35.584
I'll meet you at the main tree at four?

01:35.617 --> 01:37.753
Yeah, yeah, okay, fine.

01:37.787 --> 01:39.054
See you then.

01:39.955 --> 01:42.391
Wait, what no goodbye kiss?

01:48.497 --> 01:50.599
See you tonight, Matty.

01:53.502 --> 01:54.336
Bye.

01:55.905 --> 01:58.373
(engine revs)

02:07.116 --> 02:09.852
(water bubbling)

02:24.599 --> 02:27.436
(water splashing)

02:29.872 --> 02:32.207
(screaming)

02:55.831 --> 02:58.267
(eerie music)

05:15.504 --> 05:16.338
Brenda?

05:17.472 --> 05:19.141
BRENDA: Hey, Sam.

05:22.677 --> 05:25.114
It's kind of small to do so much damage.

05:25.147 --> 05:27.282
Well he's a good five feet.

05:27.316 --> 05:30.152
And you're sure he's the culprit?

05:30.185 --> 05:31.253
Yeah.

05:31.286 --> 05:33.288
Those idiots gutted him.

05:34.689 --> 05:37.126
I mean I really should've
been called you know.

05:37.159 --> 05:39.261
How many did they kill
before finding this one?

05:39.294 --> 05:41.230
You don't wanna know.

05:42.898 --> 05:45.034
Well you know how these
podon towns are run.

05:45.067 --> 05:47.669
I mean hell, they called
me out on this case.

05:47.702 --> 05:51.873
The big CSI guy coming
out on a missing dog case.

05:52.807 --> 05:54.376
At least it wasn't a kid.

05:54.409 --> 05:57.412
Yeah as the victim or the culprit?

05:57.446 --> 05:58.247
Either.

06:03.218 --> 06:04.419
So.

06:04.453 --> 06:05.921
When you going to the big city?

06:05.955 --> 06:06.755
Next week.

06:06.788 --> 06:07.589
Oh yeah?

06:07.622 --> 06:08.757
Yeah.

06:08.790 --> 06:10.059
You gonna miss working around here?

06:10.092 --> 06:11.026
Oh yeah.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.327
Gator bites and knife fights,

06:12.361 --> 06:15.464
the dream of every young CSI agent.

06:15.497 --> 06:17.832
Well you know it's gonna
be different in Nawlins.

06:17.866 --> 06:18.867
I hope so.

06:20.169 --> 06:22.804
You wanna grab a bite to eat?

06:22.837 --> 06:26.141
I can't I have this nuisance
call I have to go check on.

06:26.175 --> 06:27.376
You're kidding me.

06:27.409 --> 06:28.410
That makes four this year already

06:28.443 --> 06:29.911
and the summer just started?

06:29.945 --> 06:32.814
Well my money is on the fact
that this is one probably

06:32.847 --> 06:34.549
not a gator.

06:34.583 --> 06:35.985
SAM: Oh yeah?

06:36.018 --> 06:36.918
Yeah when you put it
like this I have been out

06:36.952 --> 06:38.387
to this house,

06:38.420 --> 06:42.391
four or five times I think
she just likes the attention.

06:42.424 --> 06:43.758
Gotta love those people.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.294
Yeah.

06:45.327 --> 06:46.428
But you know it gives me a
chance to do some research

06:46.461 --> 06:48.297
out there so.

06:48.330 --> 06:49.731
What's up there?

06:49.764 --> 06:52.334
Well it's either a really
big daddy gator or a

06:52.367 --> 06:54.469
new pod has moved in.

06:54.503 --> 06:56.071
I'll check it out, yeah.

06:56.105 --> 06:57.872
Well I tell you what if
you find a monster gator

06:57.906 --> 06:59.541
up there you just give me a call and

06:59.574 --> 07:01.843
I'll coming running back.

07:01.876 --> 07:04.446
Monster gator, right.

07:04.479 --> 07:06.081
I will.

07:06.115 --> 07:07.649
You have a good time in Nawlins.

07:07.682 --> 07:08.583
Alright.

07:08.617 --> 07:09.684
I'll call you before I leave.

07:09.718 --> 07:12.721
(engine turns over)

07:14.589 --> 07:17.759
(upbeat guitar music)

07:26.935 --> 07:29.604
* I was born with feet so heavy **

07:29.638 --> 07:31.506
So I'm gonna show him around town.

07:31.540 --> 07:34.109
You know, help him get his
bearings, show him the ropes.

07:34.143 --> 07:35.810
What's he like?

07:35.844 --> 07:37.012
The sheriff?

07:39.114 --> 07:40.182
He's kinda quiet.

07:40.215 --> 07:41.616
A bit of loof.

07:41.650 --> 07:43.752
No but cool, really cool.

07:44.853 --> 07:47.956
He's done real police work, Marion.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.724
He's very handsome.

07:51.526 --> 07:52.727
I think I'll take him
around and introduce

07:52.761 --> 07:54.329
him to all the folks in town today.

07:54.363 --> 07:56.598
He stopped in here a few mornings.

07:56.631 --> 07:57.932
No wedding ring.

07:58.967 --> 08:01.036
I didn't notice that.

08:01.070 --> 08:04.106
I did notice Travis Beecher
racing around town in his truck.

08:04.139 --> 08:05.040
Well,

08:05.074 --> 08:07.008
time for the summer crowds.

08:07.042 --> 08:08.210
I'm just glad they spend all their time

08:08.243 --> 08:10.045
out at the lake so they don't bother us.

08:10.079 --> 08:13.782
I thought those kids
were friends of yours.

08:13.815 --> 08:15.450
I have a serious job now, Marion,

08:15.484 --> 08:19.654
I've got lots of responsibilities,
to serve and protect.

08:20.622 --> 08:21.456
Thank you.

08:22.757 --> 08:23.958
Sorry about that.

08:23.992 --> 08:26.495
(phone ringing)

08:26.528 --> 08:28.697
It's the sheriff.

08:28.730 --> 08:29.831
Morning, sir.

08:33.235 --> 08:34.068
Yes, sir.

08:36.871 --> 08:38.707
Yeah I can be right
over to the bait shop.

08:38.740 --> 08:41.610
Alright see you there, sir.

08:41.643 --> 08:42.876
Gotta go.

08:42.910 --> 08:43.845
Duty calls.

08:45.147 --> 08:48.350
Thanks for breakfast, Marion.

08:48.383 --> 08:50.552
Sorry about that, Bob.

08:50.585 --> 08:52.087
You going out fishing today?

08:52.121 --> 08:53.422
That's what I do.

08:53.455 --> 08:55.490
Alright be careful from those gators.

08:55.524 --> 08:59.828
Ain't the gators you gotta
worry about out there.

08:59.861 --> 09:02.431
It's those lunatic lake people.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.134
(laughing)

09:05.167 --> 09:06.301
Just kidding.

09:06.335 --> 09:07.169
Right.

09:08.237 --> 09:09.771
Gators I get.

09:09.804 --> 09:12.774
It's people who are mostly crazy.

09:12.807 --> 09:14.176
Alright Bob.

09:14.209 --> 09:17.112
Be safe out on the lake, bye Marion.

09:17.146 --> 09:20.315
Little late to be heading
out fishing, don't you think?

09:20.349 --> 09:22.317
Well what else I got to do with my day?

09:22.351 --> 09:25.487
I heard the rich kids are
back in town for the summer.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.688
Stupid kids.

09:27.656 --> 09:29.491
Ruined my fishing spot.

09:29.524 --> 09:33.228
I thought they stayed on that
island with the big house.

09:33.262 --> 09:35.197
Yeah so did I.

09:35.230 --> 09:36.265
Well,

09:36.298 --> 09:37.966
have a good day on the luck.

09:37.999 --> 09:39.434
Thanks, Marion.

09:44.239 --> 09:47.142
(soft piano music)

10:35.690 --> 10:39.228
(exhaling sharply)

10:39.261 --> 10:40.829
BRENDA: Mrs. Biggins.

10:40.862 --> 10:42.831
Did you get rid of it?

10:42.864 --> 10:43.732
Yeah.

10:43.765 --> 10:45.634
So here's the thing.

10:45.667 --> 10:46.501
Yeah.

10:48.703 --> 10:51.540
SO this is the same log I
got called out for last week.

10:51.573 --> 10:52.674
No.

10:52.707 --> 10:53.875
BRENDA: No it hasn't moved.

10:53.908 --> 10:55.377
This was different.

10:55.410 --> 10:57.011
Gators move so.

10:57.045 --> 10:59.214
If you saw this one moving.

11:00.249 --> 11:01.750
Here's the thing.

11:01.783 --> 11:05.320
If you leave an alligator
alone, they'll leave you alone.

11:05.354 --> 11:09.023
It was no log that I saw, it
was at least a 20 foot gator,

11:09.057 --> 11:10.492
it was a gator.

11:10.525 --> 11:12.894
Okay I'm sure that's
what you thought you saw,

11:12.927 --> 11:14.963
but if there was a 20 foot gator

11:14.996 --> 11:16.298
here,

11:16.331 --> 11:18.400
I promise you I would know about it.

11:18.433 --> 11:21.336
I know what I saw, it was
a gator, it was massive.

11:21.370 --> 11:22.771
Okay.

11:22.804 --> 11:23.638
Yes ma'am.

11:23.672 --> 11:24.806
Yeah, huge.

11:24.839 --> 11:25.640
(dog barking)

11:25.674 --> 11:26.875
Oh.

11:26.908 --> 11:29.411
I'm just glad it didn't
get my Fluffy, scary.

11:29.444 --> 11:30.612
Fluffy, hey.

11:32.381 --> 11:33.848
Your little

11:33.882 --> 11:35.417
Fluffy.

11:35.450 --> 11:37.319
You have nothing to
worry about with Fluffy,

11:37.352 --> 11:38.753
I think Fluffy's

11:38.787 --> 11:40.021
fine, it's more

11:41.256 --> 11:43.925
the Yorky size ones that
we have to worry about.

11:43.958 --> 11:45.126
You know what?

11:46.295 --> 11:48.697
Just sign that just
saying that I came out,

11:48.730 --> 11:51.633
that would be helpful, yeah thanks.

11:56.605 --> 11:58.807
And thank you Mrs. Biggins.

11:59.808 --> 12:00.942
It was no log.

12:00.975 --> 12:03.445
Okay, have a nice day.

12:03.478 --> 12:04.979
See you next week.

12:06.881 --> 12:07.882
Hi, it's me.

12:08.917 --> 12:09.884
Yeah.

12:09.918 --> 12:11.486
It's fine.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.154
It was a log.

12:13.187 --> 12:14.022
Again.

12:15.390 --> 12:16.925
Yep.

12:16.958 --> 12:19.828
Alright I'm gonna
check on that big nest.

12:19.861 --> 12:22.297
I'll check in with you later.

12:22.331 --> 12:23.432
Okay.

12:23.465 --> 12:24.299
Bye.

12:30.004 --> 12:31.105
(water splashing)

12:31.139 --> 12:34.242
(somber piano music)

12:54.529 --> 12:55.697
Stupid fish.

12:56.565 --> 12:57.499
Stupid rod.

13:06.808 --> 13:07.709
Stupid log.

13:16.084 --> 13:18.353
(growling)

13:23.458 --> 13:27.629
(screaming)
(crunching)

13:37.138 --> 13:40.809
(upbeat instrumental music)

13:45.747 --> 13:47.516
Dude, dude, Matt.

13:47.549 --> 13:48.349
Watch the land.

13:48.383 --> 13:49.217
Sorry, Jason.

13:49.250 --> 13:50.351
That's a pretty girl.

13:50.385 --> 13:51.586
Sure is.

13:51.620 --> 13:52.887
Thought you only had eyes for Jamie.

13:52.921 --> 13:53.788
MATTY: I can look.

13:53.822 --> 13:54.756
JASON: Yeah.

13:54.789 --> 13:56.391
Having luck with her yet?

13:56.425 --> 13:58.126
Well we spent the entire
morning together on the lake.

13:58.159 --> 13:59.794
Look at you.

13:59.828 --> 14:01.029
How far'd you get?

14:01.062 --> 14:02.564
Hey a gentleman does not kiss and tell.

14:02.597 --> 14:04.599
Yeah a guy who doesn't get
any doesn't kiss and tell.

14:04.633 --> 14:07.235
She's a classy girl, alright, I gotta

14:07.268 --> 14:08.503
take it slow.

14:08.537 --> 14:09.704
Yeah.

14:09.738 --> 14:11.606
Glaciers move faster than you, Matty.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.474
Glaciers.

14:14.275 --> 14:16.277
Well she's going out to Beecher's
island with me tonight.

14:16.310 --> 14:17.679
Can't get lucky at Travis's place,

14:17.712 --> 14:19.247
can't get lucky anywhere.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.649
Getting lucky.
JASON: Hey.

14:20.682 --> 14:22.350
Our dorky friend Matt here.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.252
Hey I am a geek, not a dork.

14:24.285 --> 14:25.420
There's no difference.

14:25.454 --> 14:26.488
Yeah of course there's the difference.

14:26.521 --> 14:27.388
Do tell.

14:27.422 --> 14:28.990
Geeks are sexier.

14:30.124 --> 14:32.326
Maybe there's hope
for you and Jamie yet.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.562
Oh I love Jamie.

14:33.595 --> 14:34.729
Are you guys coming
to Beecher's tonight?

14:34.763 --> 14:35.964
That's the plan.

14:35.997 --> 14:37.298
Yes, we're gonna have so much fun.

14:37.331 --> 14:38.600
Babe, I thought we were
gonna have some alone

14:38.633 --> 14:40.034
time this weekend.

14:40.068 --> 14:41.636
Oh come on but everyone's
going to the island.

14:41.670 --> 14:43.071
Exactly, no privacy.

14:43.104 --> 14:45.373
Travis's place has tons of empty rooms

14:45.406 --> 14:47.208
and therefore tons of privacy.

14:47.241 --> 14:49.310
Well my place only has
empty rooms and therefore

14:49.343 --> 14:50.579
actual privacy.

14:51.946 --> 14:55.850
I promise you'll be rewarded
if we go to Beecher's.

14:57.051 --> 14:59.721
Okay you guys are gonna, I'm gonna.

15:01.189 --> 15:02.591
CLAUDIA: Bye Matt.

15:02.624 --> 15:03.892
Bye.

15:03.925 --> 15:07.095
(upbeat guitar music)

15:20.374 --> 15:21.576
Sheriff.

15:21.610 --> 15:23.612
Now this right here is what you need.

15:23.645 --> 15:25.046
Aye.

15:25.079 --> 15:26.748
Can I help y'all find something, Clyde?

15:26.781 --> 15:28.249
Deputy Barnes.

15:28.282 --> 15:30.284
You know you're suppose
to call me Deputy, Kim.

15:30.318 --> 15:32.253
Yes, sir, Deputy Kim.

15:33.688 --> 15:37.559
And you must be the new sheriff in town.

15:37.592 --> 15:39.260
Sheriff Jones, please to meet you?

15:39.293 --> 15:40.461
KIM: Kim.
Kim.

15:40.495 --> 15:42.230
Kim Whitley.

15:42.263 --> 15:44.432
I hear you're from New York City.

15:44.465 --> 15:45.900
Yes ma'am.

15:45.934 --> 15:48.036
And yet you sound like
such a polite southerner.

15:48.069 --> 15:50.739
It's because the Sheriff's
originally from Atlanta, Kim.

15:50.772 --> 15:52.306
Well welcome.

15:52.340 --> 15:53.407
Are y'all looking for
anything particular

15:53.441 --> 15:55.877
or just checking out the locals?

15:55.910 --> 15:59.313
No I'm looking for some
line and a spinner bait.

15:59.347 --> 16:00.715
You don't have any line

16:00.749 --> 16:03.084
that's over 100 pound test do you?

16:03.117 --> 16:04.986
I don't think so, why?

16:05.019 --> 16:07.021
I just been fishing the
same spot the past few days

16:07.055 --> 16:08.289
and I broke my line twice nearly

16:08.322 --> 16:10.625
took my arm the second time.

16:10.659 --> 16:12.460
You fishing a spinner
bait and breaking line?

16:12.493 --> 16:13.962
Seems to be.

16:13.995 --> 16:15.664
Well that must be one
hell of a bass to break

16:15.697 --> 16:17.131
a 100 pound test.

16:17.165 --> 16:18.567
You sure you're not getting hung up?

16:18.600 --> 16:19.801
Kim.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.402
I think the Sheriff
knows what he's doing.

16:21.435 --> 16:23.471
Well maybe not, Deputy.

16:23.504 --> 16:26.107
I am new to this lake lap but,

16:26.140 --> 16:27.542
pretty sure it was a fish, Kim,

16:27.576 --> 16:29.878
cause I took the line on the boat.

16:29.911 --> 16:31.746
Well I don't think we
have anything stronger.

16:31.780 --> 16:32.914
Sorry, Sheriff.

16:32.947 --> 16:34.148
No worries.

16:34.182 --> 16:36.484
Can I help you find something, Clyde?

16:36.517 --> 16:39.153
I just thought Jamie was
suppose to work Friday morning.

16:39.187 --> 16:42.290
What is it every guy falling
in love with that girl.

16:42.323 --> 16:43.558
She's not that special.

16:43.592 --> 16:45.760
Who's this girl, Deputy?

16:45.794 --> 16:47.261
No one, sir.

16:47.295 --> 16:48.529
Just a girl.

16:48.563 --> 16:50.464
She was suppose to work this morning.

16:50.498 --> 16:51.733
She's never late.

16:51.766 --> 16:54.068
Probably texted her a dozen times.

16:54.102 --> 16:55.670
Nice to meet you, Sheriff.

16:55.704 --> 16:56.705
Same here.

16:57.538 --> 16:59.140
KIM: Hello, boys.

17:08.482 --> 17:09.282
You know Sheriff.

17:09.317 --> 17:10.483
Yeah?

17:10.518 --> 17:12.286
I'd like to go check in on Jamie.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.155
You know just to make
sure everything's okay.

17:14.188 --> 17:17.090
She's not the type of girl
to miss work without calling.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.628
Go ahead Deputy but I'm sure she's fine.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.865
You know the whole reason
I moved to this town?

17:23.897 --> 17:24.733
No.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.870
The slow down, go fishing.

17:28.903 --> 17:30.471
Be in a town where
nothing ever happens and

17:30.504 --> 17:32.473
people only die of old age.

17:32.506 --> 17:33.742
Well you picked the right place then.

17:33.775 --> 17:36.911
Yeah I'm sure she's fine, you go ahead.

17:36.945 --> 17:38.279
Make sure you check in.

17:38.312 --> 17:39.113
Yes, sir.

17:39.147 --> 17:41.349
(eerie music)

17:41.382 --> 17:44.052
(engine racing)

17:48.089 --> 17:51.025
(tires screeching)

17:52.694 --> 17:53.561
You okay, kid?

17:53.594 --> 17:54.796
Yeah, yeah.

17:54.829 --> 17:55.830
BOY: You could've
been road kill.

17:55.864 --> 17:56.765
Oh shut up.

17:56.798 --> 17:59.167
You just watch yourself, Jeter.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.034
Hey.

18:01.302 --> 18:02.837
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

18:02.871 --> 18:03.972
What's your name?

18:04.005 --> 18:04.806
MAN: My name?

18:04.839 --> 18:05.640
Yeah.

18:05.674 --> 18:06.507
Travis Beecher.

18:06.540 --> 18:07.475
Travis?

18:07.508 --> 18:08.877
Watch where you're going there.

18:08.910 --> 18:10.745
You almost hit these kids.

18:10.779 --> 18:12.046
What kids?

18:12.080 --> 18:15.784
You don't kill anybody
on my shift you got it?

18:15.817 --> 18:17.218
Okay.

18:17.251 --> 18:19.420
Whatever you say, Sheriff.

18:21.589 --> 18:22.556
Here you go boys.

18:22.590 --> 18:24.192
Don't be strangers.

18:26.460 --> 18:27.461
Hey there, girly.

18:27.495 --> 18:28.697
Hey.

18:28.730 --> 18:29.597
What you doing flirting
with all these fella's

18:29.630 --> 18:31.532
when you know I'm here.

18:33.267 --> 18:35.003
You know you're the only guy for me.

18:35.036 --> 18:36.237
Good.

18:36.270 --> 18:37.706
Come on grab your stuff
let's get out of here.

18:37.739 --> 18:38.907
I have to be here all day now
that Jamie didn't show up.

18:38.940 --> 18:40.174
Oh come on baby this place is dead.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.076
Everyone who's anyone is
coming back to my place.

18:42.110 --> 18:43.678
I thought you guys weren't
leaving till' the afternoon.

18:43.712 --> 18:44.879
Don't you wanna get there early.

18:44.913 --> 18:46.214
Of course I do but not all of

18:46.247 --> 18:47.682
us have big jobs in the city,

18:47.716 --> 18:49.684
some of us have to work a
whole shift to earn a living.

18:49.718 --> 18:50.985
Oh come on.

18:51.019 --> 18:51.920
How much do you need?

18:51.953 --> 18:53.822
Don't treat me like that.

18:53.855 --> 18:54.956
What? Come on I'm sorry.

18:54.989 --> 18:57.225
Alright I didn't mean that.

19:01.629 --> 19:02.931
Hey.

19:02.964 --> 19:03.898
I'm Travis.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.969
Yeah, I know.

19:08.002 --> 19:09.270
Really?

19:09.303 --> 19:12.073
Yeah I'm here every summer.

19:12.106 --> 19:13.007
Carrie?

19:13.041 --> 19:13.842
Or Jenny?

19:13.875 --> 19:14.675
Jenny it is.

19:14.709 --> 19:15.643
KIM: Are you kidding me?

19:15.676 --> 19:16.477
What?

19:16.510 --> 19:17.678
I was just

19:17.712 --> 19:20.314
being friendly here to our neighbor.

19:20.348 --> 19:21.149
Melody.

19:21.182 --> 19:21.983
Melody.

19:22.016 --> 19:22.817
Right.

19:22.851 --> 19:24.618
Oh come on, baby.

19:24.652 --> 19:26.320
You know you're the only girl for me.

19:26.354 --> 19:27.355
Better be.

19:30.224 --> 19:31.392
Six o'clock.

19:34.528 --> 19:35.830
So do you fish?

19:35.864 --> 19:36.765
Sometimes.

19:36.798 --> 19:37.999
Really?

19:38.032 --> 19:38.933
You should come out this weekend,

19:38.967 --> 19:40.134
we're going to Beecher's Island.

19:40.168 --> 19:41.469
We're gonna be doing lots of fishing.

19:41.502 --> 19:42.636
Really?

19:42.670 --> 19:43.471
Yeah.

19:43.504 --> 19:45.840
Thanks, maybe I will.

19:45.874 --> 19:47.375
So um.

19:47.408 --> 19:48.642
See you at six.

19:51.645 --> 19:53.882
You know I didn't mean anything by that.

19:53.915 --> 19:55.784
Just remember who your girlfriend is.

19:55.817 --> 19:57.551
How could I forget?

20:05.626 --> 20:10.464
Ran into your granddaughter
Melody at the store.

20:10.498 --> 20:12.366
Yeah, she looks different.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.837
I'm sure she'll make
friends this summer.

20:20.074 --> 20:21.876
That girl can be so mean.

20:21.910 --> 20:22.743
Yeah.

20:24.245 --> 20:25.079
Yeah.

20:26.247 --> 20:29.083
(water splashing)

20:31.652 --> 20:34.722
Stupid summer people, give me a break.

20:34.755 --> 20:35.589
Fluffy!

20:36.590 --> 20:37.425
Fluffy!

20:38.392 --> 20:39.627
Fluffy!

20:39.660 --> 20:40.461
(clapping)

20:40.494 --> 20:41.329
Fluffy!

20:42.196 --> 20:43.597
(dog panting)

20:43.631 --> 20:44.432
(slow piano music)

20:44.465 --> 20:46.700
(clapping)

20:50.371 --> 20:52.874
(eerie music)

21:01.983 --> 21:06.154
(screaming)
(crunching)

21:15.629 --> 21:18.066
(dog wining)

21:22.536 --> 21:25.039
(eerie music)

21:44.192 --> 21:45.994
(knocking on door)

21:46.027 --> 21:46.895
Hello?

21:46.928 --> 21:48.429
Jamie?

21:48.462 --> 21:50.064
It's Deputy Barnes.

21:52.233 --> 21:53.434
Jamie?

21:53.467 --> 21:54.903
Are you in there?

22:10.885 --> 22:12.320
(shouting)

22:12.353 --> 22:13.787
Hi, Mrs. Castell.

22:15.056 --> 22:16.690
It's me Deputy Barnes.

22:16.724 --> 22:17.892
Who?

22:17.926 --> 22:20.561
I'm a friend of Jamie's,
Deputy Clyde Barnes.

22:20.594 --> 22:23.631
I've never heard her mention you.

22:23.664 --> 22:24.865
Oh.

22:24.899 --> 22:26.367
Well have you seen her
today because she didn't

22:26.400 --> 22:29.203
show up for work and we, her
boss was a little worried.

22:29.237 --> 22:30.704
Oh Mac.

22:30.738 --> 22:32.473
He's probably drunk as a
skunk, he wouldn't notice

22:32.506 --> 22:34.542
if she was there or not.

22:34.575 --> 22:35.776
Right.

22:35.809 --> 22:37.278
Well I just wanted to
make sure she was okay.

22:37.311 --> 22:39.847
I'm sure she is, she went
down to the lake earlier

22:39.880 --> 22:42.250
and she's probably still there.

22:42.283 --> 22:43.751
Well when you see her can
you have her check in?

22:43.784 --> 22:45.553
I just wanna make sure
everything's alright.

22:45.586 --> 22:46.454
Sure.

22:46.487 --> 22:47.821
Thanks, ma'am.

22:56.664 --> 22:59.100
(eerie music)

23:29.797 --> 23:32.033
(shouting)

23:57.691 --> 23:58.926
Matt, it's five o'clock.

23:58.959 --> 24:02.396
She's obviously not
coming dude, let's go.

24:02.430 --> 24:04.298
She said she'd be here alright, just,

24:04.332 --> 24:06.834
let me call her one more time.

24:07.801 --> 24:09.870
Hi Jamie it's Matt um,

24:09.903 --> 24:12.373
I'm, we're waiting for you at the dock.

24:12.406 --> 24:16.210
So just give me a call let
me know how far you are okay?

24:16.244 --> 24:17.545
Bye.

24:17.578 --> 24:19.047
Matt?

24:19.080 --> 24:21.215
I just texted her and told her
to catch a ride with Travis.

24:21.249 --> 24:22.650
We wanna get out there
and choose the good rooms

24:22.683 --> 24:23.784
before other people get out there.

24:23.817 --> 24:25.286
JASON: Get in the boat.

24:25.319 --> 24:26.354
Besides after she has to
ride out here with Travis,

24:26.387 --> 24:28.922
you're gonna look like a prince.

24:28.956 --> 24:30.491
Come on dude, get in the boat.

24:30.524 --> 24:31.492
Get in the boat.

24:31.525 --> 24:33.294
Get in the boat, yes.

24:34.262 --> 24:35.096
Let's go!

24:35.929 --> 24:36.930
Woo!

24:36.964 --> 24:39.967
(upbeat rock music)

25:00.454 --> 25:03.624
(photos snapping)

25:03.657 --> 25:05.893
(vomiting)

25:10.231 --> 25:11.565
SHERIFF: You gonna be okay now?

25:11.599 --> 25:13.167
Yeah, I think so.

25:15.103 --> 25:16.370
How you holding up Mrs. Castell?

25:16.404 --> 25:17.771
Who's that? Who are you?

25:17.805 --> 25:19.973
This is the new Sheriff, ma'am.

25:20.007 --> 25:22.176
I am so sorry for your loss.

25:22.210 --> 25:24.178
What's that smell?

25:24.212 --> 25:25.613
Sorry.

25:25.646 --> 25:27.348
Got a little sick.

25:27.381 --> 25:29.983
Something ain't right here.

25:30.017 --> 25:31.585
Where are you pushing me.

25:31.619 --> 25:32.953
I'm sorry ma'am I thought you'd just be

25:32.986 --> 25:35.022
more comfortable back inside.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.125
I can get there myself.

25:38.426 --> 25:39.827
Are you sure that's her?

25:39.860 --> 25:42.330
Are you sure that's my Jamie?

25:42.363 --> 25:44.398
Yes we're sure ma'am.

25:44.432 --> 25:46.900
We'll keep you informed
of the investigation.

25:46.934 --> 25:47.768
I'm sorry.

25:48.736 --> 25:49.570
Sheriff?

26:00.848 --> 26:03.351
Looks like you boys got a gator attack.

26:03.384 --> 26:04.718
Gator?

26:04.752 --> 26:05.786
No way.

26:05.819 --> 26:07.054
Look at those edges.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.656
That's not a gator.

26:11.525 --> 26:12.993
Gator.

26:13.026 --> 26:14.262
What you have here, Sheriff,

26:14.295 --> 26:15.963
is an unfortunate alligator attack.

26:15.996 --> 26:18.098
Victim looks to be female.

26:18.132 --> 26:20.368
Early to mid 20's.

26:20.401 --> 26:22.370
I'd say the rest of her is
either in the belly of the beast

26:22.403 --> 26:23.504
or fish food.

26:24.672 --> 26:27.441
How we gonna catch this gator?

26:27.475 --> 26:28.776
The bite marks, you're
dealing with a larger

26:28.809 --> 26:31.078
than average predator.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.380
Have to run a few tests though,

26:32.413 --> 26:35.549
get back to you with exact dimensions.

26:35.583 --> 26:36.550
It's a big lake.

26:36.584 --> 26:38.519
It's a big lake.

26:38.552 --> 26:40.988
Probably have to keep people
off it till' we find it.

26:41.021 --> 26:44.725
Nah a thing like this rarely
happens, gator attack.

26:44.758 --> 26:46.994
I'd say he's gonna be
full for a long time now.

26:47.027 --> 26:48.862
Time enough for you boys to find him.

26:48.896 --> 26:51.499
Still say that's not a gator.

26:52.866 --> 26:54.368
We'll get everything
wrapped up here, Sheriff.

26:54.402 --> 26:56.437
Sent off to the morgue for you.

26:56.470 --> 26:58.739
I'll probably have something
for you in a few days.

26:58.772 --> 26:59.740
Thank you, agent.

26:59.773 --> 27:00.974
Thank you.

27:01.008 --> 27:02.676
Thank you, hell of a welcome party.

27:02.710 --> 27:04.545
SHERIFF: Yes it is.

27:06.947 --> 27:09.950
(upbeat rock music)

27:21.629 --> 27:23.764
CLAUDIA: I always forget how
far away this place this is.

27:23.797 --> 27:24.698
JASON: Yeah.

27:24.732 --> 27:26.967
No one can here you scream.

27:28.336 --> 27:32.373
* Later we'll be something

27:32.406 --> 27:36.176
* Kids can't wait for Summer

27:38.879 --> 27:43.050
* Mom's can't wait for Fall *

27:44.885 --> 27:47.455
I'll go get things opened up.

27:56.664 --> 27:58.899
Jeez, Claudia, it's just a gator.

27:58.932 --> 28:00.368
I swear it just looked at me.

28:00.401 --> 28:03.003
Hey what's happening up here?

28:08.542 --> 28:10.311
You act like you never seen one before.

28:10.344 --> 28:12.145
They're all over the place, come on.

28:12.179 --> 28:14.748
Not one that looked
at me like I'm lunch.

28:14.782 --> 28:17.084
Yeah it's a huge one.

28:17.117 --> 28:18.552
That's what she said?

28:18.586 --> 28:19.420
Ohhh.

28:23.724 --> 28:26.226
(eerie music)

28:30.398 --> 28:32.966
So still no sight of the pod.

28:34.134 --> 28:37.338
Judging by the size of this nest.

28:37.371 --> 28:40.708
This is one really big group of animals.

28:44.011 --> 28:46.280
Or just one really big one.

28:55.122 --> 28:55.956
Come on.

28:56.857 --> 28:58.559
I've seen you before.

28:59.727 --> 29:00.561
Come on.

29:10.904 --> 29:13.374
What do you mean you have no service?

29:13.407 --> 29:17.210
Come on no reception,
you're a satellite phone.

29:17.244 --> 29:18.312
(bushes bristling)

29:18.346 --> 29:19.680
Shit.

29:19.713 --> 29:20.548
Sam.

29:21.449 --> 29:22.883
Scared the shit out of me.

29:22.916 --> 29:23.751
Not you.

29:25.052 --> 29:25.886
What?

29:27.321 --> 29:29.890
Looks like you were right
about your large gator.

29:29.923 --> 29:31.892
What do you mean?

29:31.925 --> 29:35.429
Some poor girl went and
got herself chomped.

29:35.463 --> 29:36.330
Is she?

29:36.364 --> 29:38.031
Yeah, dead.

29:38.065 --> 29:39.733
That's why I'm here.

29:42.670 --> 29:44.204
Huh.

29:44.237 --> 29:46.407
And did that happen
around here somewhere?

29:46.440 --> 29:47.307
Yep.

29:47.341 --> 29:48.342
Helena.

29:48.376 --> 29:50.310
So who's in charge?

29:50.344 --> 29:51.812
You'll like this guy.

29:51.845 --> 29:53.414
He's just your type.

29:53.447 --> 29:55.115
What is that suppose to mean?

29:55.148 --> 29:57.184
Nothing, he's very professional.

29:57.217 --> 29:58.285
From up north.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.454
Came here to retire.

30:00.488 --> 30:02.590
Okay, so I'm gonna give him a call.

30:02.623 --> 30:05.092
Make sure he doesn't do anything
stupid before I get there.

30:05.125 --> 30:07.628
And then I'm gonna go see him.

30:07.661 --> 30:08.929
You coming?

30:08.962 --> 30:10.464
After you.

30:10.498 --> 30:13.033
Welcome back, Sammy.

30:13.066 --> 30:15.969
(calm piano music)

30:26.179 --> 30:29.617
Hi can you connect me to the
Helena of Sheriff's department?

30:29.650 --> 30:30.984
Sure, I'll hold.

30:36.724 --> 30:39.226
(eerie music)

30:42.396 --> 30:43.997
SAM: Binoculars?

30:45.466 --> 30:46.299
Yeah.

30:48.402 --> 30:49.437
Okay.

30:49.470 --> 30:50.303
Thanks.

30:55.743 --> 30:58.579
(phone ringing)

30:58.612 --> 30:59.447
Clyde.

31:00.948 --> 31:01.782
Clyde.

31:02.616 --> 31:04.117
Will you get that?

31:05.686 --> 31:07.254
Sheriff's office.

31:08.622 --> 31:11.559
Look, Sheriff Jones
already gave a statement.

31:11.592 --> 31:12.693
Who's this again?

31:12.726 --> 31:13.794
Hey.

31:13.827 --> 31:15.195
Just tell em' no comment.

31:15.228 --> 31:18.198
Says she's from the
Wildlife Ecology Institute.

31:18.231 --> 31:19.132
And?

31:19.166 --> 31:20.734
She's an expert in reptiles.

31:20.768 --> 31:21.769
Oh.

31:21.802 --> 31:24.738
Sorry, an alligator expert.

31:24.772 --> 31:26.239
Okay.

31:26.273 --> 31:30.010
Says she needs to come down
and check out Jamie's remains.

31:30.043 --> 31:31.479
We're not even sure it's Jamie.

31:31.512 --> 31:33.447
It's Jamie, sir.

31:33.481 --> 31:35.148
Tattoo on her ankle.

31:38.619 --> 31:40.921
We still have to go
through all the forensics.

31:40.954 --> 31:43.090
We've got a hell of a lot
of paper to do which I hate

31:43.123 --> 31:46.794
so you just tell this
gal thanks, no thanks.

31:47.695 --> 31:48.629
Yes, sir.

31:50.030 --> 31:52.800
I appreciate your time ma'am but.

31:54.334 --> 31:55.168
Oh.

31:56.570 --> 31:57.404
Okay.

31:58.739 --> 32:01.074
Well I guess we could
use your help then.

32:01.108 --> 32:02.175
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:02.209 --> 32:04.678
Okay, we're on Main Street and.

32:04.712 --> 32:06.880
Oh you'll be here in 30 minutes?

32:06.914 --> 32:08.448
Closer than I thought.

32:08.482 --> 32:10.684
Well thank you Mrs. Gray.

32:10.718 --> 32:12.786
Sorry miss, see you then.

32:24.197 --> 32:25.933
Whatcha lookin' at?

32:27.434 --> 32:30.137
I can swear I just saw.

32:30.170 --> 32:31.438
You're never gonna believe me.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.874
Okay come on try me.

32:33.907 --> 32:36.009
I think I just saw a white gator.

32:36.043 --> 32:37.545
An Albino gator?

32:38.712 --> 32:41.381
God I wish it was an Albino gator.

32:41.414 --> 32:42.950
I mean I just caught
a glimpse of it but.

32:42.983 --> 32:44.818
No, would've been a Crane,

32:44.852 --> 32:47.054
Diamond fur fish, you
see a flash of white,

32:47.087 --> 32:48.589
a splash of water.

32:48.622 --> 32:50.624
You know, I don't know, how
many drinks you had today?

32:50.658 --> 32:52.059
Very funny.

32:52.092 --> 32:52.960
Look,

32:52.993 --> 32:54.494
Albino gators are

32:54.528 --> 32:56.396
incredibly rare.

32:56.429 --> 32:57.765
If there was one in these parts I would

32:57.798 --> 32:59.833
definitely know about it.

33:00.701 --> 33:01.635
You're the expert.

33:01.669 --> 33:02.670
Yes I am.

33:02.703 --> 33:05.305
And I'm off to see the Sheriff.

33:07.140 --> 33:07.975
Hello?

33:08.942 --> 33:10.578
Right.

33:10.611 --> 33:14.347
I'm gonna go start the
reports on the victim.

33:20.754 --> 33:22.055
(door slamming)

33:22.089 --> 33:23.557
What's going on?

33:23.591 --> 33:26.560
Oh she's gonna come down
and check out the remains.

33:26.594 --> 33:27.895
Who is coming down and
why does she need to

33:27.928 --> 33:29.563
check out the remains?

33:29.597 --> 33:31.031
Her name's Brenda Gray.

33:31.064 --> 33:32.666
She's the alligator expert
in the area and she's

33:32.700 --> 33:35.569
contacted whenever a report
of an attack happens.

33:35.603 --> 33:36.837
(scoffing)

33:36.870 --> 33:39.306
Why does she need to
get involved in this?

33:39.339 --> 33:42.776
She says from what she heard
from what CSI brought in,

33:42.810 --> 33:45.245
it's not a gator attack.

33:45.278 --> 33:46.747
Clyde?

33:46.780 --> 33:48.682
I know working in New York
City the past few years

33:48.716 --> 33:51.719
doesn't make me an expert
in homicide by gator.

33:51.752 --> 33:54.588
But if it walks like a duck
and it quacks like a duck

33:54.622 --> 33:56.624
and it leaves a gator
tooth in its victim.

33:56.657 --> 33:58.058
It's just your.

33:58.992 --> 34:00.828
There's something off.

34:02.462 --> 34:04.698
Alright Clyde, well
maybe this gator expert

34:04.732 --> 34:06.900
will give me some hooking.

34:07.835 --> 34:09.268
What's the name again?

34:09.302 --> 34:10.469
Brenda Gray.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.274
Brenda.

34:15.175 --> 34:16.376
Gray.

34:16.409 --> 34:18.145
I think she spells
that E-Y or A-Y.

34:18.178 --> 34:19.012
No, A-Y.

34:20.648 --> 34:21.481
E-Y.

34:27.187 --> 34:28.621
Nice ride, Trav.

34:28.656 --> 34:30.489
Hey, it got us here.

34:31.391 --> 34:33.326
And in so much style.

34:35.594 --> 34:36.996
Oh please.

34:37.030 --> 34:40.033
I thought money things didn't
matter to you, princess.

34:40.067 --> 34:41.467
Where's Jamie?

34:41.501 --> 34:42.703
I called her a dozen times when she

34:42.735 --> 34:43.871
didn't show up to work.

34:43.904 --> 34:45.371
Wait, she didn't show up to work?

34:45.405 --> 34:46.706
It's no big deal, maybe something
happened to her grandma

34:46.739 --> 34:49.009
so we brought Melody, yeah.

34:51.444 --> 34:52.913
She's a model.

34:52.946 --> 34:54.514
Uh, hi, I'm Matt.

34:55.547 --> 34:57.417
Yeah I know.

34:57.450 --> 35:00.353
I come to this town every summer.

35:00.387 --> 35:01.221
Oh, uh.

35:04.291 --> 35:05.392
Dude?

35:05.425 --> 35:07.327
What's the matter with you bro?

35:07.360 --> 35:08.528
You could totally score.

35:08.561 --> 35:09.697
You're a real dick, Travis.

35:09.730 --> 35:10.998
Yeah okay thanks.

35:11.031 --> 35:12.733
Oh by the way,

35:12.766 --> 35:14.768
cells don't work out here.

35:14.802 --> 35:16.303
Oh great.

35:16.336 --> 35:17.671
A little help there, man?

35:17.705 --> 35:18.706
What's the matter?

35:18.739 --> 35:20.640
You coming up?

35:20.674 --> 35:21.675
Cassie and I are gonna go have some

35:21.709 --> 35:23.210
alone time before dinner.

35:23.243 --> 35:24.111
So will you?

35:24.144 --> 35:25.412
Oh, okay.

35:25.445 --> 35:27.447
Let me help you with that.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.150
(country music)

35:36.857 --> 35:38.892
* You think I'm

35:38.926 --> 35:41.094
* Lookin' over your shoulder

35:41.128 --> 35:43.130
* I swear

35:43.163 --> 35:44.932
* It happens over and over

35:44.965 --> 35:47.234
* Staring at me

35:47.267 --> 35:51.705
* Wiggle round and round I look at you *

35:51.739 --> 35:54.607
* And I want this and

35:54.641 --> 35:58.746
* I wanna see what can it
be feeling your heart **

35:59.947 --> 36:01.281
Oh wow.

36:01.314 --> 36:03.116
This place is amazing.

36:03.150 --> 36:06.820
Oh thank you, why don't
I give you the tour.

36:06.854 --> 36:08.288
Or maybe not.

36:08.321 --> 36:09.322
Can you give her the tour, Matty?

36:09.356 --> 36:10.557
Matty, give her the tour please.

36:10.590 --> 36:12.125
You give me a tour.

36:12.159 --> 36:14.161
Oh I'm in trouble now.

36:18.531 --> 36:19.366
Hey.

36:21.334 --> 36:23.570
Oh come on, Matty.

36:23.603 --> 36:26.073
I'm sure Jamie's fine.

36:26.106 --> 36:27.674
Besides,

36:27.707 --> 36:29.609
we have the whole summer.

36:29.642 --> 36:31.945
Think he was counting on
his summer starting tonight.

36:31.979 --> 36:34.414
Well, here's to the first day of summer.

36:34.447 --> 36:36.683
It's already been a doozey.

36:38.051 --> 36:40.353
It's so nice to finally be here.

36:40.387 --> 36:41.554
Come on, you've been here before.

36:41.588 --> 36:43.223
Yeah everyone's been
out here at some point.

36:43.256 --> 36:44.691
Hey you remember that huge
party we had right after

36:44.724 --> 36:46.359
we all graduated from college?

36:46.393 --> 36:48.195
Yeah the one where Travis
burned down the kitchen.

36:48.228 --> 36:49.963
Oh Travis I can't
believe your parents let

36:49.997 --> 36:51.364
you back here after that.

36:51.398 --> 36:52.766
Well I paid for the damages and look,

36:52.800 --> 36:54.634
we got a great view of the lake now.

36:54.667 --> 36:57.337
(laughing)

36:57.370 --> 36:59.406
Oh come on, Melody, I am
sure that I've invited

36:59.439 --> 37:01.308
you for some event of debauchery.

37:01.341 --> 37:02.175
Nope.

37:04.211 --> 37:06.914
You know Claudia, you've
always been nice to me but

37:06.947 --> 37:10.350
I wasn't exactly in
this crowd, you know?

37:14.321 --> 37:15.588
Back braces.

37:15.622 --> 37:17.024
Russian grandma chick.

37:17.057 --> 37:19.326
Oh, metal back Melody.

37:19.359 --> 37:20.928
Now I remember.

37:20.961 --> 37:22.129
Oh.

37:22.162 --> 37:24.664
Okay well you look
hot now with all that.

37:24.697 --> 37:27.400
Okay, I think we should
all get unpacking.

37:27.434 --> 37:28.335
I'm hungry.

37:28.368 --> 37:29.236
Let's go eat.

37:29.269 --> 37:30.203
Let's go.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.609
(upbeat guitar music)

37:39.146 --> 37:41.081
[Cassie God this is beautiful.

37:41.114 --> 37:42.182
Yeah it is.

37:44.017 --> 37:46.686
CASSIE: I have a better idea.

37:52.792 --> 37:55.628
(water splashing)

38:01.568 --> 38:02.402
Alright.

38:06.539 --> 38:07.474
Hey Kim.

38:07.507 --> 38:08.942
Catch.

38:08.976 --> 38:10.110
Oh thanks for helping out, Travis.

38:10.143 --> 38:11.478
Hey I'm routing dicks.

38:11.511 --> 38:12.779
So why don't you make
yourself useful and

38:12.812 --> 38:14.081
throw me a beer, babe.

38:14.114 --> 38:15.015
Did you just call me babe?

38:15.048 --> 38:17.650
Yeah you got a problem?

38:17.684 --> 38:18.651
Are you serious.

38:18.685 --> 38:19.887
(laughing)

38:19.920 --> 38:20.921
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:20.954 --> 38:21.955
Big mistake.

38:23.656 --> 38:24.491
Hey.

38:28.395 --> 38:31.231
(water splashing)

38:34.134 --> 38:35.602
Not yet.

38:35.635 --> 38:36.503
Oh yeah?

38:36.536 --> 38:38.305
Playing hard to get?

38:38.338 --> 38:39.672
Not that hard.

38:51.084 --> 38:52.519
(screaming)

38:52.552 --> 38:54.521
TRAVIS: She's got
a set of lungs now.

38:54.554 --> 38:55.388
John!

38:56.957 --> 38:57.991
Asshole.
TRAVIS: Ow.

38:58.025 --> 38:58.926
BRUNETTE WOMAN: John!

38:58.959 --> 39:01.094
CLAUDIA: What the hell?

39:01.128 --> 39:02.395
John!

39:02.429 --> 39:05.598
TRAVIS: Cassie and John,
was that screaming?

39:05.632 --> 39:06.466
Got ya.

39:08.201 --> 39:09.036
You ass.

39:10.070 --> 39:11.171
That's not funny.

39:11.204 --> 39:13.540
I was just playing around.

39:16.276 --> 39:17.110
Come here.

39:31.191 --> 39:32.092
John!

39:32.125 --> 39:34.494
Stop it, stop playing around.

39:37.030 --> 39:39.566
(shouting)

39:39.599 --> 39:40.433
John!

39:41.268 --> 39:42.069
(screaming)

39:42.102 --> 39:44.804
(thrilling music)

39:44.837 --> 39:46.106
JASON: John!

39:47.040 --> 39:48.475
Help!

39:48.508 --> 39:49.342
Cassie!

39:51.311 --> 39:52.645
Somebody help me.

39:52.679 --> 39:53.513
Cassie!

39:55.482 --> 39:57.985
Don't go in the water, don't go in.

39:58.018 --> 39:58.986
Let's take the boat.

39:59.019 --> 40:00.153
Cassie!

40:00.187 --> 40:01.188
Hold on Cassie!

40:01.221 --> 40:02.055
John!

40:03.023 --> 40:05.458
(shouting)

40:05.492 --> 40:06.326
Cassie!

40:07.694 --> 40:08.628
TRAVIS: It won't start.

40:08.661 --> 40:09.496
Hey!

40:11.298 --> 40:12.132
Cassie!

40:16.336 --> 40:17.170
Cassie!

40:24.544 --> 40:26.146
(screaming)

40:26.179 --> 40:27.014
Cassie!

40:33.553 --> 40:37.124
MATT: What the
hell just happened?

40:37.157 --> 40:38.391
That was a crocodile.

40:38.425 --> 40:40.193
Alligator.

40:40.227 --> 40:41.428
What?

40:41.461 --> 40:43.463
Crocodiles aren't in
Lucien, we have gators.

40:43.496 --> 40:44.964
You guys who the hell cares what it was,

40:44.998 --> 40:46.233
it just killed our friends.

40:46.266 --> 40:47.667
Can we get inside cause I think,

40:47.700 --> 40:49.302
I am freaking out.

40:49.336 --> 40:51.071
Yeah I think we're all
freaking out, Matt.

40:51.104 --> 40:52.839
Hey Travis is there a
phone inside that works?

40:52.872 --> 40:54.374
Yeah.

40:54.407 --> 40:55.075
Alright let's go, let's
go inside, call for help.

40:55.108 --> 40:55.875
Go, go, go!

40:57.877 --> 41:00.313
(eerie music)

41:13.026 --> 41:13.826
Brenda Gray.

41:13.860 --> 41:14.927
On the phone.

41:15.862 --> 41:18.098
But you can call me Brenda.

41:18.131 --> 41:20.400
Nice to meet you I'm
Clyde, Deputy Barnes

41:20.433 --> 41:21.834
and this is Sheriff Jones.

41:21.868 --> 41:23.603
Brenda Gray the same Brenda Gray

41:23.636 --> 41:27.207
who recently had a DUI
and assault charges?

41:29.909 --> 41:31.578
Sheriff, those charges
have been taken care of

41:31.611 --> 41:35.382
and should be no concern
to you or this case.

41:35.415 --> 41:37.350
I'm the alligator expert in this region,

41:37.384 --> 41:39.252
I'm called upon successfully

41:39.286 --> 41:42.622
I might add for all matters
concerning gator attacks.

41:42.655 --> 41:43.723
So here I am.

41:44.957 --> 41:46.593
Well I don't mean to
judge you Ms. Gray.

41:46.626 --> 41:49.162
I just don't want any
trouble in my town is all.

41:49.196 --> 41:50.430
Well that seems

41:50.463 --> 41:51.964
you already have a little trouble, sir.

41:51.998 --> 41:55.735
That's non-human trouble,
nothing I can do about that.

41:55.768 --> 41:58.838
So what can you tell us about
our murderous gator friend

41:58.871 --> 42:00.140
that would help us?

42:00.173 --> 42:01.408
Well,

42:01.441 --> 42:03.276
firstly murdering is what humans do.

42:03.310 --> 42:04.877
This creature is killing for survival,

42:04.911 --> 42:06.546
they don't have a modern compass.

42:06.579 --> 42:10.583
Killing is killing, I don't
care about them though.

42:10.617 --> 42:12.319
Okay well I can help you capture it

42:12.352 --> 42:13.253
and then we can remove it from here.

42:13.286 --> 42:14.621
No wait, wait.

42:15.788 --> 42:18.825
You wanna catch and save
it and not destroy it.

42:18.858 --> 42:20.260
That is interesting.

42:20.293 --> 42:22.495
It's only doing what nature
will have it do, sir.

42:22.529 --> 42:25.632
It does not deserve to
be destroyed for that.

42:25.665 --> 42:27.700
Sheriff's office.

42:27.734 --> 42:29.068
Hi Ms. Peterson.

42:30.002 --> 42:30.837
Uh huh.

42:32.272 --> 42:34.006
I'll let him know.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.643
Ms. Peterson's calling
to complain again

42:36.676 --> 42:38.811
that the brunette boys are
shooting off their BB guns

42:38.845 --> 42:40.180
in her backyard.

42:42.582 --> 42:44.951
Put her on standby.

42:44.984 --> 42:47.254
Sheriff will come talk
to the boys again.

42:47.287 --> 42:48.688
Thanks, ma'am.

42:48.721 --> 42:50.022
Clyde, I'm sure you
can help Ms. Gray here

42:50.056 --> 42:51.358
with whatever she needs.

42:51.391 --> 42:52.225
Ma'am.

42:57.230 --> 42:59.799
Gosh thanks for your help, Sheriff.

42:59.832 --> 43:01.033
It's just,

43:01.067 --> 43:03.770
he thinks it's such
an open and shut case.

43:03.803 --> 43:06.839
Well then I guess I bet
he's not coming with us.

43:06.873 --> 43:08.175
So you agree with him that

43:08.208 --> 43:10.109
this isn't an alligator attack?

43:10.143 --> 43:12.145
Okay I don't know anything for sure.

43:12.179 --> 43:13.313
But,

43:13.346 --> 43:15.215
well, I believe every case deserves to

43:15.248 --> 43:17.917
be investigated properly.

43:17.950 --> 43:18.785
And,

43:20.187 --> 43:22.955
I'll know straight away
when I can examine the body.

43:22.989 --> 43:23.890
Okay.

43:23.923 --> 43:26.226
Let's go to the morgue then.

43:33.666 --> 43:35.468
What are you following me?

43:35.502 --> 43:37.304
Just came to drop these
files off to the Sheriff.

43:37.337 --> 43:38.205
He left but

43:38.238 --> 43:39.572
here I can take them.

43:39.606 --> 43:41.441
I take it you two know each other.

43:41.474 --> 43:42.809
Yeah.

43:42.842 --> 43:44.744
He thinks it's a
straight up gator attack.

43:44.777 --> 43:46.045
Has all the markings of one.

43:46.078 --> 43:48.181
Why do you think I called you in?

43:48.215 --> 43:50.116
Well we're heading to the
morgue, you wanna join?

43:50.149 --> 43:51.017
Sure.

43:51.050 --> 43:52.285
Okay.

43:52.319 --> 43:53.085
I'll go put these on the Sheriff's desk,

43:53.119 --> 43:54.521
I'll be right back.

43:56.623 --> 43:57.890
Well Dudley Dooright
sure does wanna make this

43:57.924 --> 43:59.626
a bigger case than it is.

43:59.659 --> 44:00.827
Be nice.

44:00.860 --> 44:02.562
You don't seriously
think it's not a gator?

44:02.595 --> 44:04.163
Well I don't know what
it is which is why

44:04.197 --> 44:06.466
we're going to the morgue.

44:06.499 --> 44:08.401
I'm ready, we can go.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.171
After you.

44:17.810 --> 44:18.945
(doors slamming)

44:18.978 --> 44:20.179
So which way?

44:20.213 --> 44:23.516
BOTH MEN: Take this road
straight out of town.

44:23.550 --> 44:24.384
Hey.

44:25.518 --> 44:26.553
So Clyde,

44:26.586 --> 44:27.887
how long have you lived here?

44:27.920 --> 44:29.756
My whole life.

44:29.789 --> 44:31.258
Well I'm sorry.

44:31.291 --> 44:32.559
I like this town.

44:32.592 --> 44:33.926
A lot of people like this town.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.962
You gotta like the
tough guy Sheriff Jones.

44:35.995 --> 44:39.098
Yeah didn't he come here to retire?

44:41.734 --> 44:45.538
(engine turning over)

44:45.572 --> 44:48.408
(thrilling music)

44:50.977 --> 44:54.481
KIM: I think I'm gonna be sick.

44:54.514 --> 44:56.516
How could 911 be busy?

44:58.618 --> 45:00.320
Dude will you shut her up?

45:00.353 --> 45:02.088
She's in a bit shock man, we all are.

45:02.121 --> 45:05.525
Dude, crying is not gonna
solve anything, alright?

45:05.558 --> 45:07.294
You're trying 911 again?

45:07.327 --> 45:08.428
No, Sheriff's office.

45:08.461 --> 45:09.696
Hello?

45:09.729 --> 45:12.532
This is Travis Beecher,
if you get this message,

45:12.565 --> 45:14.066
something's happening
at Beecher's Island

45:14.100 --> 45:15.067
so can you please.

45:15.101 --> 45:17.970
(electricity buzzing)
Hello?

45:18.004 --> 45:19.939
Guys the electricity's
off in half the house.

45:19.972 --> 45:20.873
The phones dead.

45:20.907 --> 45:22.309
What the hell is going on?

45:22.342 --> 45:24.210
Okay well we're safe inside here, right?

45:24.243 --> 45:25.545
Gator can't open doors, right?

45:25.578 --> 45:26.513
Right, right, right, yeah, right, right.

45:26.546 --> 45:28.948
That's what it was.

45:28.981 --> 45:31.518
I mean the phones out and
the electricity's out, why?

45:31.551 --> 45:33.085
It's an old house, Kim,
alright, you know that,

45:33.119 --> 45:34.987
you've been here so many times.

45:35.021 --> 45:36.055
Okay, calm down.

45:36.088 --> 45:37.457
Claudia can you get her a drink,

45:37.490 --> 45:38.391
I think it'll calm her down.

45:38.425 --> 45:40.427
Travis, where's your fuse box?

45:40.460 --> 45:41.894
It's out back.

45:41.928 --> 45:43.162
Screw that we got electricity
in this part of the house,

45:43.195 --> 45:44.364
I say we just hover down here,

45:44.397 --> 45:45.832
try to get the speedboat working.

45:45.865 --> 45:47.066
No, no, hovering it down
man, I'm not gonna sit here

45:47.099 --> 45:48.368
until the morning with
my thumb up my ass.

45:48.401 --> 45:49.669
Let's go get your boat.

45:49.702 --> 45:50.570
No, no.

45:50.603 --> 45:51.571
Don't go outside.

45:51.604 --> 45:54.441
I'm not going in the water, okay?

46:00.647 --> 46:02.014
I think we should all drink.

46:02.048 --> 46:03.383
I second that.

46:12.625 --> 46:13.426
Nice

46:13.460 --> 46:14.293
morgue.

46:15.194 --> 46:16.963
It's all we have.

46:16.996 --> 46:18.498
I don't really have much need for one

46:18.531 --> 46:20.767
so we're lucky this clinic
lets us use the back room.

46:20.800 --> 46:22.602
What, no one dies in this town?

46:22.635 --> 46:24.904
Die of anything except old age.

46:24.937 --> 46:26.339
Well till' now.

46:29.041 --> 46:30.309
Easy there, cowboy.

46:30.343 --> 46:31.511
I'm okay.

46:31.544 --> 46:32.379
I'm.

46:35.648 --> 46:36.983
He's not okay.

46:38.418 --> 46:40.319
I think Barny Fifa's sweet on you.

46:40.353 --> 46:43.122
I think anyone who uses
the term sweet on you

46:43.155 --> 46:44.657
should be over 80.

46:46.926 --> 46:47.760
Okay.

46:49.095 --> 46:49.929
Yep.

46:52.565 --> 46:53.400
Gator.

46:54.734 --> 46:55.568
Yeah.

46:56.569 --> 46:57.470
Yep, gator.

46:58.805 --> 46:59.806
However.

46:59.839 --> 47:00.707
What?

47:00.740 --> 47:01.708
See these

47:01.741 --> 47:03.342
edges here.

47:03.376 --> 47:04.477
SAM: Yeah.

47:05.445 --> 47:07.113
Oh come on Sam.

47:07.146 --> 47:10.883
These tear patterns are not
consistent with alligator.

47:10.917 --> 47:12.251
I don't know.

47:12.284 --> 47:13.786
Looks like an alligator to me.

47:13.820 --> 47:14.987
Case closed.

47:15.021 --> 47:16.255
You know what, let's
not be in such a rush to

47:16.288 --> 47:18.858
get out of town that we
overlook the obvious.

47:18.891 --> 47:20.427
Yeah and let's not be
in such a rush to prove

47:20.460 --> 47:23.295
it's not a gator that we
overlook the evidence.

47:23.329 --> 47:24.664
Okay.

47:24.697 --> 47:27.434
Obviously there was
a gator involved but.

47:27.467 --> 47:28.635
But what?

47:28.668 --> 47:31.337
But something is not adding up, Sam.

47:31.370 --> 47:32.338
Alright.

47:32.371 --> 47:33.606
Prove me wrong.

47:35.942 --> 47:36.776
Ugh.

47:37.744 --> 47:38.578
Okay.

47:45.051 --> 47:46.018
Oh what the hell is this?

47:46.052 --> 47:48.555
Oh I don't believe this.

47:48.588 --> 47:50.122
Alright you know what
let's take the jet ski.

47:50.156 --> 47:51.658
No it's broken.

47:51.691 --> 47:53.159
I have the kayaks.

47:53.192 --> 47:54.461
I'm not getting on that little ass boat

47:54.494 --> 47:55.828
with that alligator out there.

47:55.862 --> 47:56.729
Yeah you're right.

47:56.763 --> 47:57.997
Okay let me think.

47:58.030 --> 47:58.831
Um.

48:00.433 --> 48:02.368
Alright I got this, look.

48:02.401 --> 48:04.303
I'm gonna tie the rope around my waist.

48:04.336 --> 48:05.572
That's a bad idea.

48:05.605 --> 48:06.939
No wait, I'm gonna jump into the boat

48:06.973 --> 48:08.107
and you're gonna pull me out.

48:08.140 --> 48:09.542
I can tell you this is a bad idea,

48:09.576 --> 48:10.743
it's like 20 yards you're
never gonna make it.

48:10.777 --> 48:12.712
Dude, I'll make it, alright, watch.

48:12.745 --> 48:14.113
Oh wait, hold on.

48:14.146 --> 48:15.515
Why are you taking your shirt off?

48:15.548 --> 48:17.817
Dude, it's Italian, it's expensive.

48:17.850 --> 48:19.351
You're a douche.

48:23.255 --> 48:24.624
For the record this is a terrible idea.

48:24.657 --> 48:26.225
No it's not, watch.

48:26.258 --> 48:27.059
You ready?

48:27.093 --> 48:29.328
Go.
TRAVIS: Okay.

48:29.361 --> 48:32.198
(water splashing)

48:34.166 --> 48:37.403
See I told you, you wouldn't make it.

48:39.171 --> 48:42.108
You're floating it the other way, idiot.

48:42.141 --> 48:42.942
Get out of the water.

48:42.975 --> 48:44.343
Just face it.

48:44.376 --> 48:47.547
There's nothing out here
alright, you're freaking me out.

48:47.580 --> 48:50.850
Still man, just get out of the water.

48:52.685 --> 48:54.153
Almost there man.

48:54.186 --> 48:55.522
You just need to relax man,
there's nothing out here.

48:55.555 --> 48:57.590
Come on man, just get out of the water.

48:57.624 --> 48:59.391
Just get out, come on.

49:01.060 --> 49:01.894
Come on.

49:04.664 --> 49:05.498
Travis?

49:06.432 --> 49:07.266
Travis!

49:09.301 --> 49:10.737
Travis!

49:10.770 --> 49:11.604
Travis!

49:23.315 --> 49:24.150
Gator.

49:25.952 --> 49:26.786
Not gator.

49:29.455 --> 49:30.857
Gator, not gator.

49:33.325 --> 49:35.662
Looks like you got this one solved.

49:35.695 --> 49:38.030
I have seen this before.

49:38.064 --> 49:39.866
I know I have.

49:39.899 --> 49:40.733
Hold on.

49:42.769 --> 49:44.003
Yeah excuse me.

49:45.304 --> 49:46.773
Oh god, not the book.

49:46.806 --> 49:48.841
Okay you mock me.

49:48.875 --> 49:50.042
You just wait.

49:50.943 --> 49:52.178
I swear I.

49:52.211 --> 49:53.045
Here.

49:55.481 --> 49:58.017
You don't see the similarities?

49:58.050 --> 49:59.151
Where's this?

49:59.185 --> 50:00.452
Atlanta.

50:00.486 --> 50:02.388
You were called in for a
gator attack in Atlanta?

50:02.421 --> 50:05.324
Exactly, even you know they're
not suppose to be up there.

50:05.357 --> 50:06.759
Yeah but you were
called in because there

50:06.793 --> 50:08.394
was a gator attack.

50:10.029 --> 50:13.700
Yes, there's evidence
of gator involvement.

50:13.733 --> 50:15.334
And he was found?

50:16.335 --> 50:19.005
Sorta, yeah, yeah, he was but.

50:25.778 --> 50:27.614
Jeez, Brenda this is like

50:27.647 --> 50:29.115
serial killer porn.

50:29.148 --> 50:31.718
You know what Sam, there's
something going on alright.

50:31.751 --> 50:34.120
There's something at play
that's more than just a gator.

50:34.153 --> 50:36.823
If you could stop being a fat head,

50:36.856 --> 50:39.626
just open your eyes for a second.

50:40.960 --> 50:41.961
Fat head?

50:41.994 --> 50:42.829
Really?

50:46.799 --> 50:50.202
I'm sorry I called you fat head.

50:50.236 --> 50:51.771
But you,

50:51.804 --> 50:53.539
you have to trust me.

50:56.042 --> 50:57.243
Alright.

50:57.276 --> 50:58.711
Let's take a look.

51:04.016 --> 51:05.017
Thank you.

51:10.790 --> 51:11.624
See this.

51:17.429 --> 51:18.264
I mean.

51:19.465 --> 51:21.167
Wait, do you see this?

51:21.200 --> 51:22.334
No, what is it?

51:22.368 --> 51:23.269
I don't know.

51:23.302 --> 51:25.371
You think you can get it?

51:31.978 --> 51:33.479
Explain that, Sam.

51:35.314 --> 51:38.250
I'm really sorry about that, guys.

51:38.284 --> 51:41.453
Well deputy, it seems
you just might be right.

51:41.487 --> 51:42.655
What do you mean?

51:42.689 --> 51:44.456
He means we are going back to the lake

51:44.490 --> 51:47.393
to find out exactly
what happened to Jamie.

51:47.426 --> 51:49.261
Alright but I'm never
getting in that water again.

51:49.295 --> 51:50.797
Okay you know what Clyde,
you have more chance

51:50.830 --> 51:54.033
of being struck by lightning
than being bit by a gator.

51:54.066 --> 51:55.634
There's still an investigation
about 30 miles from

51:55.668 --> 51:57.236
here on a lightning strike.

51:57.269 --> 52:00.139
[Clyde And Brenda] Not helping.

52:00.172 --> 52:01.407
Yeah well.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.142
You kids have fun out
there on the water.

52:03.175 --> 52:04.476
I'm gonna stay back here
and see how long it takes

52:04.510 --> 52:06.145
to get a full report back on this.

52:06.178 --> 52:08.247
You know I said I'd never
go in the water again

52:08.280 --> 52:10.216
but I never said anything
about going on it.

52:10.249 --> 52:11.918
Oh yeah that's a nice head, Clyde.

52:11.951 --> 52:12.785
Yep.

52:18.524 --> 52:20.693
(beeping)

52:25.164 --> 52:26.766
What are you even doing out here?

52:26.799 --> 52:29.736
Kim was crying out for Travis
so I came out to get him.

52:29.769 --> 52:31.037
Come on we gotta go.

52:31.070 --> 52:32.571
Are you just gonna leave him out there?

52:32.604 --> 52:33.873
JASON: Yeah.

52:36.008 --> 52:39.011
We heard screaming, what happened?

52:40.046 --> 52:41.680
Where's Travis?

52:41.714 --> 52:42.548
He's.

52:43.649 --> 52:44.516
He's.

52:44.550 --> 52:45.417
(sobbing)

52:45.451 --> 52:46.652
He's dead.

52:46.685 --> 52:47.519
He's dead.

52:49.756 --> 52:51.023
CLAUDIA: Okay what
the hell is going on?

52:51.057 --> 52:52.491
Okay, okay we can't just,

52:52.524 --> 52:53.625
we can't just stand here,
we need to calm down

52:53.659 --> 52:54.861
and figure out what to do.

52:54.894 --> 52:56.729
There has to be an
emergency phone right?

52:56.763 --> 52:58.097
Someway to get in touch
with the mainland?

52:58.130 --> 53:00.666
Yeah you would think, Matt.

53:00.699 --> 53:03.770
I've never seen anything like that.

53:04.971 --> 53:06.538
(crying)

53:06.572 --> 53:08.140
This has gotta be a dream.

53:08.174 --> 53:10.009
It's gotta be a dream.

53:11.744 --> 53:13.245
It's not a dream.

53:13.279 --> 53:14.146
It's not a dream buddy.

53:14.180 --> 53:15.347
Hey, hey, hey!

53:16.615 --> 53:18.650
I need you to focus, okay?

53:18.684 --> 53:21.520
I need you to focus and
help me figure out a way

53:21.553 --> 53:23.555
to get off this god damn island.

53:23.589 --> 53:25.557
You're right I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

53:25.591 --> 53:27.994
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

53:30.329 --> 53:33.833
Say what we do is we just
bunker down for the night.

53:33.866 --> 53:36.535
Nobody else leaves, nobody goes outside.

53:36.568 --> 53:37.736
Maybe in the morning
the phones will be up

53:37.770 --> 53:39.238
and we can call somebody to come get us.

53:39.271 --> 53:42.008
Yeah that's our best bet,
we'll just stay here, look it.

53:42.041 --> 53:44.543
At least in this room
we still got the lights.

53:44.576 --> 53:46.645
(crying)

53:48.614 --> 53:49.448
Well fuck.

53:50.616 --> 53:52.952
CLYDE: Now what do we do
if this gator attacks?

53:52.985 --> 53:54.787
BRENDA: Well if you're feeling
brave you could whack it

53:54.821 --> 53:57.556
on the ears and the shock
will send it running.

53:57.589 --> 53:59.225
CLYDE: How do you know
where the ears are?

53:59.258 --> 54:03.429
BRENDA: Well I know because
I'm the gator expert.

54:14.440 --> 54:18.010
Shouldn't we have a bigger boat?

54:18.044 --> 54:20.947
I mean this is a pretty big
gator we're looking for, right?

54:20.980 --> 54:22.348
Yeah.

54:22.381 --> 54:23.382
But you know what he shouldn't
be hungry for at least

54:23.415 --> 54:24.783
a week or so.

54:24.817 --> 54:28.587
Oh, well that makes me
feel so much better.

54:29.889 --> 54:31.590
Do you want me to head
back towards the dock?

54:31.623 --> 54:32.791
Nope.

54:32.825 --> 54:35.461
I wanna stay here along
the shore for a bit.

54:35.494 --> 54:38.497
I can handle being close to shore.

54:40.066 --> 54:41.667
You know.

54:41.700 --> 54:45.371
You don't seem much
like a DUI kind of girl.

54:46.438 --> 54:47.273
Well.

54:48.707 --> 54:52.478
Sometimes dead bodies
are hard for me too.

54:52.511 --> 54:54.580
And the assault charge?

54:56.682 --> 54:58.050
You got a boyfriend who likes
to punch you enough times

54:58.084 --> 54:59.551
at some point

54:59.585 --> 55:01.320
you wanna punch back.

55:06.893 --> 55:08.160
How much longer do
you wanna be out here?

55:08.194 --> 55:09.628
Wait, sh, sh, sh.

55:09.661 --> 55:11.030
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

55:11.063 --> 55:12.831
Okay, okay what is it?

55:12.865 --> 55:14.100
I don't know.

55:15.501 --> 55:17.904
It's like a log but.

55:17.937 --> 55:19.238
You know what is this?

55:19.271 --> 55:20.472
No, no, no, don't it's.

55:20.506 --> 55:22.408
Oh my god it's a gator, oh my god.

55:22.441 --> 55:23.609
Okay hold on.

55:23.642 --> 55:25.244
BRENDA: Deputy calm
down, deputy calm down.

55:25.277 --> 55:26.245
You were gonna flip the boat.

55:26.278 --> 55:27.279
But I gotta get us to.

55:27.313 --> 55:29.115
BRENDA: I know, I know.

55:29.148 --> 55:30.482
Yeah but your hand, it's bleeding.

55:30.516 --> 55:31.383
I know.

55:31.417 --> 55:32.284
Yeah I am.

55:32.318 --> 55:33.886
But that's okay.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.988
That is okay, I've done this before.

55:36.022 --> 55:36.855
Okay.

55:39.959 --> 55:41.127
Tell you what.

55:42.061 --> 55:43.529
That was no gator.

55:43.562 --> 55:44.463
What was it?

55:44.496 --> 55:46.966
No but that was not natural.

55:48.034 --> 55:49.568
Hang on.

55:49.601 --> 55:50.469
Alright.

55:50.502 --> 55:51.303
Hand me that stick.

55:51.337 --> 55:52.238
What?

55:52.271 --> 55:53.739
BRENDA: Hand me the stick.

55:53.772 --> 55:54.606
What are you doing I need
to get you back to land

55:54.640 --> 55:55.541
and to the doctor.

55:55.574 --> 55:58.244
Sh, sh, hang on, hang on.

55:58.277 --> 55:59.611
Got it, okay got it.

55:59.645 --> 56:00.446
Got what?

56:00.479 --> 56:02.481
I don't know, hang on.

56:04.550 --> 56:05.384
Oh god.

56:07.786 --> 56:08.654
Oh.

56:08.687 --> 56:10.022
What is it?

56:10.056 --> 56:11.423
It's a snare.

56:11.457 --> 56:12.591
CLYDE: For what?

56:12.624 --> 56:14.693
I don't know, catching something.

56:14.726 --> 56:18.297
Okay now just get in
the boat, can we go?

56:19.465 --> 56:20.832
We will be fine.

56:20.866 --> 56:22.034
We'll be fine.

56:23.002 --> 56:23.902
(thunder crackling)

56:23.936 --> 56:25.304
Oh god, okay we're going home.

56:25.337 --> 56:26.138
Okay it's time to go.

56:26.172 --> 56:28.574
We're going home, okay.

56:28.607 --> 56:29.875
Go.

56:29.908 --> 56:32.411
(eerie music)

56:45.557 --> 56:46.925
Alright Jason, grab your flashlight,

56:46.959 --> 56:48.260
we should go flip the
breaker see if we can get the

56:48.294 --> 56:49.795
lights on in here.

56:50.997 --> 56:52.464
Um.

56:52.498 --> 56:55.134
I don't wanna sound like
a girl in horror flick but

56:55.167 --> 56:57.203
I say we just stay here.

56:57.236 --> 56:58.537
In view of each other.

56:58.570 --> 56:59.871
K, that was probably
just the wind moving a

56:59.905 --> 57:01.373
branch or something.

57:01.407 --> 57:02.608
Even if it was.

57:02.641 --> 57:06.078
We've got food, plenty
of beer, the fire.

57:06.112 --> 57:08.614
There's no reason for
us to leave this room.

57:08.647 --> 57:10.049
Are you afraid of the dark?

57:10.082 --> 57:13.752
No, I'm afraid of what I
can't see in the dark, Matty.

57:14.720 --> 57:15.921
Yeah, yeah, you're right,

57:15.954 --> 57:18.724
there's no reason to leave this room.

57:18.757 --> 57:19.691
Um, guys.

57:21.260 --> 57:22.428
I have to pee.

57:24.063 --> 57:25.731
Yeah I'm gonna say she
leaves the room for that.

57:25.764 --> 57:26.765
Yeah.

57:26.798 --> 57:28.400
Okay come on, I'll go with you.

57:28.434 --> 57:29.768
No, don't leave me.

57:29.801 --> 57:30.969
Honey, I'm only gonna be gone a second.

57:31.003 --> 57:32.538
Matt can you just?

57:32.571 --> 57:33.405
Yeah.

57:40.379 --> 57:41.213
Come on.

57:53.459 --> 57:54.793
How drunk are you?

57:54.826 --> 57:56.262
Pretty drunk.

57:56.295 --> 57:57.329
Is it helping?

57:57.363 --> 57:59.198
The nightmare's a little

57:59.231 --> 58:00.199
blurrier.

58:00.232 --> 58:01.400
Blurrier?

58:01.433 --> 58:03.102
Does that work?

58:03.135 --> 58:05.237
(laughing)

58:05.271 --> 58:07.473
No don't make me laugh,
I'm gonna pee my pants.

58:07.506 --> 58:08.507
Where is it?

58:13.145 --> 58:15.647
(eerie music)

58:24.190 --> 58:25.023
Matt?

58:27.493 --> 58:28.494
Is that you?

58:30.696 --> 58:31.530
Hello?

58:38.003 --> 58:39.938
(door slamming)

58:39.971 --> 58:41.740
Who you talking to?

58:42.741 --> 58:44.743
Thought I saw someone.

58:48.414 --> 58:50.249
I don't see anybody.

58:54.820 --> 58:56.322
Yeah me neither.

58:58.357 --> 58:59.258
It's weird.

59:01.393 --> 59:02.228
Come on.

59:09.235 --> 59:11.570
(whistling)

59:26.518 --> 59:29.087
What are you whistling?

59:29.121 --> 59:32.791
It's just something I learned
in high school French class.

59:32.824 --> 59:35.294
That's a terrible song
about skinning a bird.

59:35.327 --> 59:38.197
It's the only one I
could think of, okay?

59:38.230 --> 59:40.098
(thunder crackling)

59:40.132 --> 59:41.567
Great.

59:41.600 --> 59:44.203
Could this day get any worse?

59:49.141 --> 59:50.642
Yeah I guess so.

59:53.945 --> 59:56.282
(whistling)

01:00:10.262 --> 01:00:13.031
(piano music)

01:00:13.064 --> 01:00:15.367
You know this thing is
actually pretty fascinating.

01:00:15.401 --> 01:00:16.835
How so?

01:00:16.868 --> 01:00:19.171
Well the way the hinge snaps
and then drags like that

01:00:19.205 --> 01:00:21.573
I mean that's like a real bear.

01:00:21.607 --> 01:00:22.608
Beautiful.

01:00:23.942 --> 01:00:26.778
When the gator attacks,
it slams its jaws shut

01:00:26.812 --> 01:00:30.716
on its prey, dragging it
to the bottom to drown it.

01:00:30.749 --> 01:00:34.920
Exhibit A would suggest this
is what happened to our victim.

01:00:36.087 --> 01:00:39.358
However, something metal was used

01:00:39.391 --> 01:00:40.326
possibly to

01:00:41.227 --> 01:00:43.161
mimic a gator's attack.

01:00:45.397 --> 01:00:48.066
Waiting on analysis of
metal object found in

01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:50.836
victim's body known as exhibit B.

01:00:55.874 --> 01:00:58.710
Oh we've got a message,
please be the Sheriff.

01:00:58.744 --> 01:01:00.145
Careful, do you have
any tools I can use to

01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:02.514
play around with this thing?

01:01:04.816 --> 01:01:06.218
Where you going?

01:01:06.252 --> 01:01:07.819
Travis Beecher and his idiot friends are

01:01:07.853 --> 01:01:09.154
stuck out on Beecher's Island.

01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:10.456
I gotta go get em'.

01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:12.424
Okay, you want any company?

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:13.925
Nah.

01:01:13.959 --> 01:01:16.027
You stay here, figure what
this is and who made it.

01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:17.696
Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:01:17.729 --> 01:01:19.164
You know what.

01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:21.300
Taking the Sheriff's boat, it's bigger.

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:22.968
Hey, hey, I need tools.

01:01:23.001 --> 01:01:24.770
Check the Sheriff's cabinet over there.

01:01:24.803 --> 01:01:25.604
See you in a bit.

01:01:25.637 --> 01:01:26.472
Yeah.

01:01:28.607 --> 01:01:32.778
Well Clyde I don't know what
tools you were talking about.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.782
I think you weren't my friend.

01:01:41.587 --> 01:01:45.090
What about you Sheriff,
you got any tools?

01:02:06.378 --> 01:02:07.212
Oh.

01:02:21.593 --> 01:02:24.095
(eerie music)

01:02:48.454 --> 01:02:49.287
Oh shit.

01:02:51.156 --> 01:02:51.990
Oh shit.

01:02:57.963 --> 01:02:58.864
[Answering Machine] Hi
this is Deputy Clyde,

01:02:58.897 --> 01:03:00.098
please leave your message,

01:03:00.131 --> 01:03:02.334
I'll get back to you soon, thanks.

01:03:02.368 --> 01:03:03.835
Clyde as soon as you get this message

01:03:03.869 --> 01:03:06.271
you have to call me back,
alright, this is urgent.

01:03:06.304 --> 01:03:09.307
You have to call me back, okay?

01:03:09.341 --> 01:03:11.877
Don't talk to anybody in Dibutula, okay?

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.179
Especially the Sheriff.

01:03:14.212 --> 01:03:15.046
I mean it.

01:03:27.993 --> 01:03:29.395
Yes, this is Brenda Gray.

01:03:29.428 --> 01:03:32.431
From the Wildlife Ecology Institute.

01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:37.102
I need state troopers
here on the double.

01:03:37.135 --> 01:03:39.004
Yes I have the right to
order back up alright,

01:03:39.037 --> 01:03:41.272
I am working the case here.

01:03:44.643 --> 01:03:45.477
Hey!

01:03:47.045 --> 01:03:48.146
Listen to me.

01:03:49.781 --> 01:03:52.117
People are being killed.

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:54.753
Okay, I need state troopers here.

01:03:54.786 --> 01:03:55.621
Right now.

01:03:58.156 --> 01:03:58.957
Thank you.

01:04:09.535 --> 01:04:11.703
Where are you Clyde?
Beecher's Island.

01:04:11.737 --> 01:04:12.571
Beecher's.

01:04:14.573 --> 01:04:15.407
Beecher's.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.429
Boy am I glad to see you.

01:04:37.463 --> 01:04:39.831
Been trying to get
a hold of you all night.

01:04:39.865 --> 01:04:41.299
Where have you been?

01:04:41.332 --> 01:04:42.868
Took a little longer over
at the Peterson place

01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:44.936
than I thought then I
got the call that these

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:46.404
folks are stuck up here.

01:04:46.438 --> 01:04:50.141
Yeah me too, that's why I'm here.

01:04:50.175 --> 01:04:51.409
Some knot out back.

01:04:51.443 --> 01:04:52.578
I'll show ya.

01:04:52.611 --> 01:04:54.312
Grab your flashlight and follow me.

01:04:54.345 --> 01:04:55.280
Yes, sir.

01:04:56.114 --> 01:04:59.150
(somber piano music)

01:05:50.969 --> 01:05:54.372
(electricity flickering)

01:05:56.775 --> 01:05:58.209
Where you going?

01:05:58.243 --> 01:06:00.178
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

01:06:00.211 --> 01:06:01.847
We had power for a minute there.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.515
Wait don't go by yourself.

01:06:03.549 --> 01:06:06.417
It's fine, it's like six in the morning.

01:06:06.451 --> 01:06:09.287
Think the boogeyman’s asleep.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.388
Be careful.

01:06:22.801 --> 01:06:25.637
(printer beeping)

01:06:33.111 --> 01:06:34.112
Holy shit.

01:06:39.818 --> 01:06:40.719
Sam.

01:06:40.752 --> 01:06:41.920
You are not gonna believe this.

01:06:41.953 --> 01:06:42.821
Yeah well you're never gonna believe

01:06:42.854 --> 01:06:44.422
what I just found out.

01:06:44.455 --> 01:06:45.957
BOTH: It's the Sheriff.

01:06:45.991 --> 01:06:47.125
Have you heard from Clyde?

01:06:47.158 --> 01:06:48.594
What?

01:06:48.627 --> 01:06:50.128
No, just sit tight I'll
call in the state troopers.

01:06:50.161 --> 01:06:51.663
I already called the state troopers,

01:06:51.697 --> 01:06:52.898
I'm going to Beecher's Island
it's where I sent your phone.

01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:54.933
No just sit tight
until I can get to you.

01:06:54.966 --> 01:06:56.267
We don't have time.

01:06:56.301 --> 01:06:57.168
Brenda.

01:06:57.202 --> 01:06:58.036
Hello?

01:06:58.904 --> 01:06:59.738
Dammit.

01:07:10.148 --> 01:07:12.217
Alright let's see here.

01:07:15.053 --> 01:07:17.522
(electricity buzzing)

01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:19.490
Good job, Jason, electrocute yourself.

01:07:19.524 --> 01:07:22.027
That's just what we need.

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.528
Oh hey.

01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:25.664
Man am I glad to see you.

01:07:27.198 --> 01:07:29.367
(screaming)

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.301
what was that?

01:07:30.335 --> 01:07:32.604
Where are Matt and Jason?

01:07:34.172 --> 01:07:35.741
Was that one of you?

01:07:35.774 --> 01:07:38.143
Jason was checking the
fuse box, where were you?

01:07:38.176 --> 01:07:39.778
I was in the bathroom.

01:07:39.811 --> 01:07:41.579
It sounded like it came from outside.

01:07:41.613 --> 01:07:42.781
Let's all go together.

01:07:42.814 --> 01:07:45.483
No, this is safe place, I'm not going.

01:07:45.516 --> 01:07:47.919
Fine stay, just don't move.

01:07:56.261 --> 01:07:57.963
Hey man what is your problem.

01:07:57.996 --> 01:07:59.597
(screaming)

01:07:59.631 --> 01:08:00.431
Jason!

01:08:00.465 --> 01:08:02.567
Go back, go, go.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.103
(eerie music)

01:08:07.338 --> 01:08:09.507
(sobbing)

01:08:11.042 --> 01:08:12.644
That looks like a
brutal alligator attack.

01:08:12.678 --> 01:08:15.781
Right is that what you think, Matt?

01:08:15.814 --> 01:08:17.649
Wait where's Melody?

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:19.785
Melody!

01:08:20.986 --> 01:08:21.819
Melody!

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.154
(screaming)

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:26.725
Jesus Christ, Kim, shut up.

01:08:26.758 --> 01:08:29.828
You're not helping
anything by screaming.

01:08:29.861 --> 01:08:31.296
Where were you?

01:08:33.398 --> 01:08:34.899
What?

01:08:34.933 --> 01:08:37.703
You were not inside with us
when we heard Jason scream.

01:08:37.736 --> 01:08:38.603
What are you talking about?

01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:40.337
She's right.

01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:43.809
I was in the bathroom, I told you that.

01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:45.844
Do you think I did this?

01:08:47.377 --> 01:08:50.180
No, okay no, we've all just
seen Scream too many times.

01:08:50.215 --> 01:08:52.317
No, Claud, don't fall
for it, it was you.

01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:53.551
What are you talking about?

01:08:53.584 --> 01:08:54.720
I was down at the docks with you.

01:08:54.752 --> 01:08:57.221
Whatever got Cassie and John came,

01:08:57.255 --> 01:08:58.488
Claud, you guys.

01:08:58.523 --> 01:09:00.158
Look it's the same night but

01:09:00.191 --> 01:09:01.158
you know me.

01:09:01.192 --> 01:09:03.294
You told me I'd kill her.

01:09:05.063 --> 01:09:06.296
What was that? Kim!

01:09:06.331 --> 01:09:07.564
Come on we have to get here.

01:09:07.598 --> 01:09:10.335
No, no, no, don't go back out there.

01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:15.707
What are we gonna do, Matt?

01:09:15.741 --> 01:09:17.341
Let's just,

01:09:17.375 --> 01:09:18.810
just stay inside.

01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:41.966
Oh my god, Sheriff.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.501
I'm so happy to see you.

01:09:43.533 --> 01:09:46.371
You have no idea what's been
happening, everybody's dead.

01:09:46.404 --> 01:09:48.573
Oh my god, Travis is dead.

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:54.712
It's that Matt and he's
crazy, he's insane.

01:09:54.746 --> 01:09:55.580
No.

01:09:56.647 --> 01:09:58.216
Matt's not the murderer.

01:09:58.249 --> 01:10:00.986
(knife thudding)

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:04.389
(hushing)

01:10:30.248 --> 01:10:31.316
Clyde.

01:10:31.349 --> 01:10:32.818
Clyde.

01:10:32.851 --> 01:10:34.319
Oh god, Clyde.

01:10:34.352 --> 01:10:35.386
Brenda?

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.454
Clyde, it's you.

01:10:36.487 --> 01:10:38.323
He put the suit in me.

01:10:41.927 --> 01:10:44.229
Okay we gotta get you out of here, Okay?

01:10:44.262 --> 01:10:45.530
Stop. Listen.

01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:49.034
The Sheriff.

01:10:49.067 --> 01:10:50.235
What?

01:10:50.268 --> 01:10:51.302
I know, you were right.

01:10:51.336 --> 01:10:53.204
CLYDE: And there's.

01:10:53.238 --> 01:10:54.072
What?

01:10:59.144 --> 01:11:01.479
I gotta get this off your leg, okay?

01:11:01.512 --> 01:11:03.248
Roll over here.

01:11:03.281 --> 01:11:04.449
Brenda, Brenda.

01:11:04.482 --> 01:11:05.650
It's not Jones.

01:11:05.683 --> 01:11:07.919
Yes, yes it is, it is.

01:11:07.953 --> 01:11:09.620
It's not just Jones.

01:11:09.654 --> 01:11:11.122
Okay look.

01:11:11.156 --> 01:11:12.423
We're gonna get him, okay,
we're gonna nail his ass

01:11:12.457 --> 01:11:13.758
to the wall, it's okay.

01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:16.127
CLYDE: It's not just him.

01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:19.364
What are you talking about?

01:11:19.397 --> 01:11:20.866
Huge

01:11:20.899 --> 01:11:22.233
white

01:11:22.267 --> 01:11:23.101
gator.

01:11:26.004 --> 01:11:27.772
Okay well you're losing blood I think

01:11:27.805 --> 01:11:29.540
you're going in to shock.

01:11:29.574 --> 01:11:31.442
It's his pet.

01:11:31.476 --> 01:11:32.911
He raised it.

01:11:32.944 --> 01:11:34.946
He told me the whole story.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.314
BRENDA: What?

01:11:39.484 --> 01:11:41.086
Tell me the story.

01:11:41.119 --> 01:11:43.454
What did he tell you?

01:11:43.488 --> 01:11:44.322
He said.

01:11:46.424 --> 01:11:48.994
He took such pride in telling me.

01:11:49.027 --> 01:11:52.363
He was chasing a guy through the sewers.

01:11:57.735 --> 01:11:59.037
And,

01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:01.172
he heard a chirping sound.

01:12:01.206 --> 01:12:03.441
(chirping)

01:12:06.978 --> 01:12:07.879
Apparently.

01:12:11.582 --> 01:12:13.051
Apparently,

01:12:13.084 --> 01:12:14.419
there have been legends
of people flushing gators

01:12:14.452 --> 01:12:16.721
down the toilet, it's true.

01:12:19.724 --> 01:12:20.558
I guess.

01:12:21.927 --> 01:12:24.095
He raised it and he

01:12:24.129 --> 01:12:28.299
says the only think he
ever had a connection with.

01:12:38.309 --> 01:12:39.510
Apparently,

01:12:39.544 --> 01:12:41.846
had a pension for human flesh.

01:12:41.879 --> 01:12:42.713
What?

01:12:43.781 --> 01:12:44.782
Wait.

01:12:44.815 --> 01:12:46.217
Wait, he's

01:12:46.251 --> 01:12:48.920
trapping humans to feed his gator?

01:12:48.954 --> 01:12:51.889
And he seemed to really enjoy it.

01:12:53.992 --> 01:12:56.661
But he did this to you, right?

01:13:00.098 --> 01:13:04.269
Clyde are you telling me
that the gator is still here?

01:13:07.172 --> 01:13:08.639
Okay we,

01:13:08.673 --> 01:13:11.409
we have to get you out
of here Clyde, okay?

01:13:11.442 --> 01:13:12.810
Hold tight.

01:13:12.843 --> 01:13:14.279
Put pressure on it.

01:13:14.312 --> 01:13:16.814
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:13:19.517 --> 01:13:20.685
Okay.

01:13:20.718 --> 01:13:22.553
This might hurt Clyde.

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:29.127
(steel creaking)

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.796
(panting)

01:13:31.829 --> 01:13:32.730
I got it.

01:13:32.763 --> 01:13:33.731
I got it, Clyde.

01:13:33.764 --> 01:13:35.033
I got it, okay.

01:13:37.235 --> 01:13:38.069
Clyde?

01:13:41.339 --> 01:13:42.173
Clyde?

01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:44.775
Clyde?

01:13:47.378 --> 01:13:48.213
Clyde?

01:13:56.421 --> 01:13:59.357
(alligator hissing)

01:14:08.433 --> 01:14:11.502
(alligator growling)

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:25.383
(alligator roaring)

01:14:40.031 --> 01:14:44.602
I've seemed to have
misplaced my favorite one.

01:14:44.635 --> 01:14:45.470
Bummer.

01:14:47.605 --> 01:14:49.374
What are you doing?

01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:52.143
Why are you doing this?

01:14:54.612 --> 01:14:55.780
Cause I can.

01:14:59.417 --> 01:15:01.219
Hush, sh, sh, sh.

01:15:01.252 --> 01:15:03.654
This next one's gonna hurt.

01:15:03.688 --> 01:15:05.856
(sobbing)

01:15:11.496 --> 01:15:13.831
(screaming)

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.934
BRENDA: Kim.

01:15:28.946 --> 01:15:30.281
And then there were two.

01:15:30.315 --> 01:15:31.316
How funny.

01:15:32.583 --> 01:15:33.518
Okay we have to do something cause

01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:35.153
I'm about to lose my mind.

01:15:35.186 --> 01:15:37.054
Slide a ride, you wanna
go try and fix that boat?

01:15:37.088 --> 01:15:38.489
No I'm not going near the water.

01:15:38.523 --> 01:15:40.158
I'm not going near that fuse box.

01:15:40.191 --> 01:15:43.561
Can't run anywhere cause
we're on a freaking island.

01:15:43.594 --> 01:15:47.232
Maybe we could light a fire
and send smoke signals.

01:15:47.265 --> 01:15:48.866
(fans powering on)

01:15:48.899 --> 01:15:51.001
Is that the power?

01:15:51.035 --> 01:15:52.036
The phone.

01:15:55.406 --> 01:15:57.908
(eerie music)

01:16:04.649 --> 01:16:05.983
(screaming)

01:16:06.016 --> 01:16:10.188
(alligator hissing)
(shouting)

01:16:20.498 --> 01:16:21.866
(thrilling music)

01:16:21.899 --> 01:16:25.170
BRENDA: What have
you done to Clyde?

01:16:34.912 --> 01:16:37.248
What's your next move, huh?

01:16:37.282 --> 01:16:38.516
I'm deciding.

01:16:40.485 --> 01:16:41.986
Either turn you in or
just kill you right now

01:16:42.019 --> 01:16:43.288
you sick piece.

01:16:44.222 --> 01:16:47.057
Oh you think that's funny?

01:16:47.091 --> 01:16:49.026
I think you're funny.

01:16:49.059 --> 01:16:51.996
I sent troopers, they're
on their way right now.

01:16:52.029 --> 01:16:53.063
Yeah?
BRENDA: Yeah.

01:16:53.097 --> 01:16:54.532
What are they gonna find, huh?

01:16:54.565 --> 01:16:56.701
A very disturbed wildlife
worker with an assault charge

01:16:56.734 --> 01:17:00.171
holding a knife and
decorating an officer.

01:17:01.639 --> 01:17:03.374
I have all the evidence I
need in a neat little pile

01:17:03.408 --> 01:17:04.475
on your desk.

01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:07.878
What does that even say?

01:17:11.616 --> 01:17:14.419
Says that you're a sad,

01:17:14.452 --> 01:17:17.422
twisted sociopath and you have been

01:17:17.455 --> 01:17:19.424
for a long time.

01:17:19.457 --> 01:17:23.861
That's not nice to call
people names like that.

01:17:23.894 --> 01:17:25.230
You're caught.

01:17:27.332 --> 01:17:28.165
It's over.

01:17:31.135 --> 01:17:32.737
I don't think so.

01:17:40.245 --> 01:17:41.412
Jeez, Jones.

01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:45.015
Didn't know you were in
to such a body count.

01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:46.651
So um,

01:17:46.684 --> 01:17:49.254
what are you gonna do with her?

01:17:51.389 --> 01:17:54.292
(gun firing)

01:17:54.325 --> 01:17:55.560
I don't like loose ends.

01:17:55.593 --> 01:17:56.827
You didn't have to do that.

01:17:56.861 --> 01:17:58.095
Didn't I?

01:17:58.128 --> 01:17:59.330
Yeah, I mean those rich
pricks, they all deserve

01:17:59.364 --> 01:18:01.366
what they got, but her?

01:18:01.399 --> 01:18:04.001
Hey listen to me, listen to me.

01:18:04.034 --> 01:18:06.103
You did such a good job.

01:18:06.136 --> 01:18:09.206
I could've never of done
this without you, sweetheart.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.208
You know I'm not gonna lie.

01:18:11.242 --> 01:18:12.943
It's been exhilarating.

01:18:12.977 --> 01:18:14.445
I mean,

01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:16.414
when you said I could get
back at these rich jerks

01:18:16.447 --> 01:18:18.983
who treated me like shit my entire life.

01:18:19.016 --> 01:18:20.485
I didn't know what you meant.

01:18:20.518 --> 01:18:22.353
This has been amazing.

01:18:23.454 --> 01:18:24.289
You know?

01:18:25.423 --> 01:18:28.393
We're like modern day Bonnie and Clyde.

01:18:29.827 --> 01:18:33.364
You know they didn't even
notice what I was doing.

01:18:33.398 --> 01:18:34.532
You proud of me?

01:18:34.565 --> 01:18:36.301
I did good right.

01:18:36.334 --> 01:18:37.935
I'm very proud of you.

01:18:37.968 --> 01:18:40.905
And I couldn't pull
this off without you.

01:18:40.938 --> 01:18:42.740
But like I said,

01:18:42.773 --> 01:18:44.609
I don't like loose ends.

01:18:44.642 --> 01:18:46.977
(screaming)

01:18:57.021 --> 01:18:57.922
Still nothing?

01:18:57.955 --> 01:18:59.724
No nothing not even a dial tone.

01:18:59.757 --> 01:19:01.292
Try it again.

01:19:01.326 --> 01:19:02.793
You think something's changed
in the passed few seconds?

01:19:02.827 --> 01:19:04.562
Matty, just try it.

01:19:05.663 --> 01:19:08.333
(phone ringing)

01:19:08.366 --> 01:19:09.800
OPERATOR: 911, what's
your emergency?

01:19:09.834 --> 01:19:11.702
Oh my god you have to help
us, we're on Beecher's Island,

01:19:11.736 --> 01:19:13.203
people are dying.

01:19:13.237 --> 01:19:14.439
OPERATOR: Okay slow down,
has their been an accident?

01:19:14.472 --> 01:19:16.206
No, no, I don't know
our friends are dead,

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.608
you have to get us off this island.

01:19:17.642 --> 01:19:19.109
[Operator] The Sheriff
called in a little while ago,

01:19:19.143 --> 01:19:21.646
he's heading out your way,
he should be there soon.

01:19:21.679 --> 01:19:23.748
Stay on the line with
me until he gets there.

01:19:23.781 --> 01:19:26.684
(knocking on door)

01:19:28.619 --> 01:19:30.688
OFFICER: State police.

01:19:33.591 --> 01:19:34.592
Oh my god.

01:19:35.526 --> 01:19:36.427
Is there some trouble out here?

01:19:36.461 --> 01:19:37.662
You have to get us out of here.

01:19:37.695 --> 01:19:39.029
OFFICER: That's
what I came to do.

01:19:39.063 --> 01:19:40.998
The police are here.

01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:41.932
Let's go.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.070
OFFICER: Sheriff, we got
a call to head out here.

01:19:46.103 --> 01:19:47.572
It's terrible.

01:19:47.605 --> 01:19:49.507
25 years I've been a
police officer and I never

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.141
seen anything like this.

01:19:51.175 --> 01:19:52.410
Have you seen Melody?

01:19:52.443 --> 01:19:53.277
Or Kim?

01:19:59.316 --> 01:20:01.586
Sheriff, what the hell's going on?

01:20:01.619 --> 01:20:04.589
It seems that we had a unique
serial killer in our town.

01:20:04.622 --> 01:20:07.458
Got all the evidence back on
my desk in my office and the,

01:20:07.492 --> 01:20:09.026
the killer, she's down there.

01:20:09.059 --> 01:20:10.395
She?

01:20:10.428 --> 01:20:11.829
Yeah, if only I wish I
would've gotten to her

01:20:11.862 --> 01:20:14.632
before she hurt somebody.

01:20:14.665 --> 01:20:15.766
OFFICER: Did you?

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.234
I had to shoot her.

01:20:17.267 --> 01:20:18.469
She won't be killing anymore.

01:20:18.503 --> 01:20:20.037
Oh thank god.

01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:22.306
I'm sorry about your friends.

01:20:22.339 --> 01:20:23.808
Deputy Clyde,

01:20:23.841 --> 01:20:26.577
he was right about everything.

01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:28.713
MATT: This is all so surreal.

01:20:28.746 --> 01:20:30.080
It's over now.

01:20:31.449 --> 01:20:34.585
Guess I'll call for backup,
get things cleaned up.

01:20:34.619 --> 01:20:37.187
I'm gonna take these two back.

01:20:37.221 --> 01:20:39.089
I'll send someone over
for evidence interviews.

01:20:39.123 --> 01:20:41.358
Alright, thanks Trooper.

01:20:41.392 --> 01:20:42.560
Come on, guys.

01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:54.204
I guess,

01:20:54.238 --> 01:20:56.306
I don't understand why she did this.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.808
There's no understanding it.

01:20:57.842 --> 01:20:59.744
Sociopath just does what he does.

01:20:59.777 --> 01:21:01.679
No rhyme or reason.

01:21:01.712 --> 01:21:03.448
Just can't wrap my head around it.

01:21:03.481 --> 01:21:04.649
We're alive.

01:21:04.682 --> 01:21:07.785
That's all I can wrap my head around.

01:21:15.259 --> 01:21:18.429
(engine turning over)

01:21:22.867 --> 01:21:25.536
(eerie music)

01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:27.204
We're okay.

01:21:27.237 --> 01:21:29.474
We're gonna be okay.

01:21:29.507 --> 01:21:30.975
Yep.

01:21:31.008 --> 01:21:32.677
We're gonna be okay.

01:21:47.992 --> 01:21:50.327
(whistling)

01:22:02.973 --> 01:22:06.143
(upbeat bluegrass music)

01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:16.787
(singing in French)
