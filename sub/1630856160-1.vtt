- Okay, ready to head
into the real crime show.

01:25:54.236 --> 01:25:57.152
It's pretty exciting. Got
a pretty sweet setup here.

01:25:58.414 --> 01:26:00.111
Through this door here, okay.

01:26:00.285 --> 01:26:04.159
So, I think they've got it all
set up.

01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:06.987
This is kinda like,
kinda like the big moment

01:26:07.945 --> 01:26:09.207
to be on TV.

01:26:10.469 --> 01:26:11.775
Called my family, they're
gonna be watching.

01:26:12.123 --> 01:26:13.211
That's exciting.

01:26:14.908 --> 01:26:16.736
And, let's see what it
looks like in there.

01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:19.913
We'll get a shot.

01:26:21.654 --> 01:26:22.612
All right.

01:26:22.786 --> 01:26:25.354
I'm excited. Okay, here we go.

01:26:25.528 --> 01:26:28.400
This is our sound guy for
the TV show.

01:26:29.836 --> 01:26:31.882
He looks exactly like
Milo Ventimiglia

01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:33.797
[group laughing]

01:26:35.712 --> 01:26:36.974
There's Danny.

01:26:40.064 --> 01:26:41.065
There's Seoul.

01:26:41.239 --> 01:26:42.501
Dammit, what the fuck.

01:26:42.675 --> 01:26:44.068
What is your problem with
the GoPro.

01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:46.505
- I want you to save it
for the actual, stop.

01:26:46.679 --> 01:26:48.812
TRAVIS: Hey, fearless leader.

01:26:48.986 --> 01:26:52.468
I'll go document the area,
professionally.

01:26:52.816 --> 01:26:55.645
ANA: I'm nobody's
leader. I'm just punctual.

01:26:56.428 --> 01:26:58.648
- Never gonna live that down.

01:27:04.567 --> 01:27:07.744
I'm nobody's leader. I'm
just punctual.

[WIND WHIPPING]

01:27:13.793 --> 01:27:15.186
Okay.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.581
There are a few things that
I want to be

01:27:18.755 --> 01:27:20.887
extremely clear about this
documentary.

01:27:21.061 --> 01:27:23.281
[WIND WHIPPING]

01:27:26.893 --> 01:27:28.591
They fucking left me.

01:27:28.765 --> 01:27:31.507
Don't really know why, and
I don't think it's funny.

01:27:31.681 --> 01:27:34.684
Out in the middle of fucking
nowhere.

01:27:34.858 --> 01:27:38.688
And I don't really think I did
anything to deserve this.

01:27:38.862 --> 01:27:41.343
I know I joke around a little
bit but um,

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:46.173
Like seriously, what
the fuck? You guys left?

01:27:47.305 --> 01:27:48.915
Still trying to find everybody.

01:27:49.089 --> 01:27:52.092
And, just wanna say ahead
of time, when I do find you,

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:55.444
that you may all come together
as a group

01:27:56.488 --> 01:27:58.838
and blow me.

01:28:05.845 --> 01:28:07.456
Here I am pissing in the woods,

01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:09.327
taking a small break from
driving around

01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:11.764
in the middle of fucking
nowhere looking for Ana.

01:28:11.938 --> 01:28:13.592
When I'm done with this,
I'll go back to that,

01:28:13.766 --> 01:28:15.290
and, I don't know, I guess
I'm going to

01:28:15.464 --> 01:28:17.770
stay here till I find her,
because I can't leave.

01:28:17.944 --> 01:28:19.598
We're here, so ...

01:28:19.772 --> 01:28:22.471
Great, awesome trip so
far. Really having a blast.

01:28:22.645 --> 01:28:24.342
Success, thanks.
