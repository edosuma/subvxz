WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:08.309
- The vibe continues here,
and what I'm going for

00:10.078 --> 00:12.080
is like a return to the classic
elegance of the 1920s,

00:12.113 --> 00:13.614
like "Great Gatsby"
kind of thing,

00:13.647 --> 00:15.216
- Yeah!
- Gold, glitz, glamour.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.118
- Don't go crazy.
It's just a policeman's ball.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.119
- Oh, okay.
Well, you know what, then?

00:18.152 --> 00:20.121
Why don't I just get
a bunch of foot-long subs,

00:20.154 --> 00:21.822
and I can just throw 'em
out there

00:21.855 --> 00:23.791
and people could devour them
"Game of Thrones" style?

00:23.824 --> 00:25.293
- Now you're talking.
- Throw in a couple of

00:25.326 --> 00:26.527
Oatmeal Cream Pies...
- I'll be down

00:26.560 --> 00:28.062
in a catcher's mitt--
are you kidding me?

00:28.096 --> 00:30.064
- Thank you so much--
- No-no-no-no-no--

00:30.098 --> 00:31.665
- Yes. I have to.
- No need--it wasn't a big deal.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.701
- It is a big deal.
I know you pulled some strings

00:33.734 --> 00:35.703
to get me this job,
and I just want to thank you.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.205
It means a lot to me.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.639
- Oh, I don't think
you heard right.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.774
I told Chief McGrath,
"Do not hire Emma."

00:40.808 --> 00:42.210
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah, I said,

00:42.243 --> 00:43.711
"She's really horrible
at her job..."

00:43.744 --> 00:44.778
- Yeah?
- "And she's definitely

00:44.812 --> 00:46.847
not gonna nail this
like she does everything else."

00:46.880 --> 00:48.382
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.850
- Thank you for
not supporting me.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.352
- You're absolutely welcome.
- I guess that's what

00:51.385 --> 00:52.820
I meant to say.
If you could write me

00:52.853 --> 00:54.288
a Yelp review,
that would be great.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.090
- [laughs]
By the way, if this goes south,

00:56.124 --> 00:58.092
I am not gonna take my clothes
off and save your ass

00:58.126 --> 00:59.493
like last time, okay?
- Emma, we're ready!

00:59.527 --> 01:01.229
- For once, I have
all the help I need,

01:01.262 --> 01:02.530
'cause I know I drive you
crazy.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.565
- You do.
You drive me so crazy.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.167
- All right, let's get
these lights turned on.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.169
- Dan, my man!
Hey!

01:08.202 --> 01:09.403
Pitching in?
Helping out?

01:09.437 --> 01:10.638
- Hi
- Hi. Nice to see you.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.173
Emma didn't tell me,
uh...

01:12.206 --> 01:14.108
I didn't expect
to see you here.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.743
You'll be seeing a lot of me.
I'm gonna help out all week.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.311
- Oh, yeah?
- Making him work for it.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.747
- You're gonna be here
on the actual night?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.149
- Yeah.
- You're gonna hang out

01:21.182 --> 01:22.483
with a bunch of
boring cops?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.884
- Oh, I'm here for this one.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.220
I can't get enough of
my little pony.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.221
- Sorry--what did you call her?
- Nothing.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.190
It's nothing.
- I've been calling her pony,

01:29.223 --> 01:29.990
'cause she kicks in bed.
- All right--

01:30.023 --> 01:31.459
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.660
- After we're done--
- That's okay--

01:32.693 --> 01:34.162
- After you're done,
she's kicking?

01:34.195 --> 01:36.164
- I would love
to see those lights.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.665
- Yeah, let's dive in.
Dan, let's show 'em

01:37.698 --> 01:39.333
what we're working with!
- All right!

01:39.367 --> 01:43.171
- Okay, guys, get ready
for Tokyo New Year!

01:43.204 --> 01:45.173
Three, two, one...

01:45.206 --> 01:46.307
- * Ah

01:46.340 --> 01:48.176
Aw...

01:48.209 --> 01:49.042
- Wow. Ha.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.445
Oof. That did not work, Dan.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.713
- [chuckling]
- Okay, easy, there.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.914
I'm not paying him
anything.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.916
- Guys, how 'bout we let
Officer Rodriguez

01:55.949 --> 01:57.418
take a little look-see here?

01:57.451 --> 01:59.353
Sometimes what you
just need to do

01:59.387 --> 02:01.389
is you just jiggle
the outlet with a knife.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.257
- With a what?
No, don't do that.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.692
- No, no, no.
[overlapping comments]

02:04.725 --> 02:05.893
[zzzzt]

02:05.926 --> 02:07.261
- Whee-ah!

02:07.295 --> 02:08.362
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

02:08.396 --> 02:09.430
Ooh, that smarts.
- You okay?

02:09.463 --> 02:10.631
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.799
I'm tasting copper
there...

02:11.832 --> 02:13.367
- Oh, is that your
fillings?

02:13.401 --> 02:14.668
- Just gotta look...
[overlapping chatter]

02:14.702 --> 02:16.570
[zzzt]

02:16.604 --> 02:17.905
- Did you seriously
do it again?

02:17.938 --> 02:20.174
- Hee! Hot damn!

02:20.208 --> 02:21.342
Whoo!

02:21.375 --> 02:22.876
Here's the problem.
It's a little loose--

02:22.910 --> 02:24.212
- Mark--
- No, stop, absolutely no--

02:24.245 --> 02:27.181
[zzzt]
[overlapping shouts]

02:29.250 --> 02:31.519
- There it is.
There you go.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.821
- Yep.
- Are you okay, man?

02:33.854 --> 02:35.856
- Yeah, baby.
Just feeling juiced!

02:35.889 --> 02:37.391
[laughing
- Looks great.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.229
- Whoo!
- I--

02:41.262 --> 02:43.297
[Say Hi's "Back before
We Were Brittle" playing]

02:43.331 --> 02:46.400
- * Hey, remember when

02:46.434 --> 02:49.237
* All of time stood still

02:49.270 --> 02:53.874
* Ooh, do do do do

02:53.907 --> 02:56.977
* Back before we were brittle

02:57.010 --> 03:00.214
* Back before
we were brittle *

03:03.417 --> 03:04.885
- You ready for
this first scrammer?

03:04.918 --> 03:06.254
- Uh, you know I am.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.289
- Here she comes.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.423
- [laughs]
Okay...no!

03:09.457 --> 03:10.791
Mark, no!

03:10.824 --> 03:11.992
- What?
What's wrong with this?

03:12.025 --> 03:12.893
- That is a Mandarin
collar,

03:12.926 --> 03:14.662
and you are neither
an Asian gentleman

03:14.695 --> 03:15.529
nor Steven Seagal,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.265
so go back from whence
you came, sir.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.567
- No, but look, I'm just
talking about...schwax.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.735
Talking about...
sker-slack.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.871
Schwax, schwax--I'm getting
a little bit of this,

03:23.904 --> 03:25.306
I'm talking about--
ba-twan!

03:25.339 --> 03:26.607
- Oh--[laughs]
- I'm really serious

03:26.640 --> 03:28.376
about this garment.
- If you think Emma's

03:28.409 --> 03:30.311
gonna let you in the ball
looking like Jon Secada,

03:30.344 --> 03:31.345
you got another think
coming.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.914
- How's that going, anyway,
uh, with Dan and Emma?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.716
- Oh, good, I think.
He just came up

03:35.749 --> 03:37.485
to the lake for a weekend.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.687
- Oh, Rabby D. got an invite
to Kimmewah?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.021
- Yeah.
- Serious, I guess.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.257
All right. And she--
And she's happy with him?

03:43.291 --> 03:45.326
He, uh, he's--
he's good to her

03:45.359 --> 03:47.595
and she's into him
and stuff?

03:47.628 --> 03:48.929
- What are you doing?

03:48.962 --> 03:51.565
- What? Nothin'.
Just--I'm just asking...

03:51.599 --> 03:53.967
questions that friends
ask about friends, I don't--

03:54.001 --> 03:56.404
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.974
- It's just that, uh,
like I was surprised

04:01.008 --> 04:02.976
to see Emma and Dan,

04:03.010 --> 04:05.913
because she's, uh, she's been
giving me different signals.

04:05.946 --> 04:06.714
- Talking about
the ankle night?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.048
- Hmm?
- You talking about

04:08.081 --> 04:09.450
the ankle night
when you guys

04:09.483 --> 04:11.018
were mounting each other?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.486
- We--[stammers]

04:12.520 --> 04:14.054
- You just signed
your divorce papers

04:14.087 --> 04:16.924
and stopped wearing
a garbage bag as a suit,

04:16.957 --> 04:18.959
so maybe you wanna
cool your jets?

04:18.992 --> 04:19.960
- [laughing] What?

04:19.993 --> 04:22.396
My jets are cool, okay?

04:22.430 --> 04:23.864
My jets are cold,
you understand?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.966
They're so cold,
you gotta de-ice my jets.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.436
That's how cold they are.
My jets are so freaking cold,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.338
they don't even have beef
with the Sharks anymore.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.672
Bam! "West Side Story."

04:31.705 --> 04:32.940
- Not many men can quote--

04:32.973 --> 04:34.642
- "West Side!"
- Okay, okay.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.544
Hey, who are you
taking to this thing?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.879
- Uh, probs...
probs going solo.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.881
Yeah, just, you know,
there's this one girl

04:40.914 --> 04:42.516
who's been
hound-dogging me--

04:42.550 --> 04:43.751
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.453
I really wish I just
had a friend

04:45.486 --> 04:47.521
who'd go with me and just,
like, get on that dance floor

04:47.555 --> 04:49.723
and just ramp it up!
You know what I mean?

04:49.757 --> 04:50.991
- I'm trying to think
if there's anybody

04:51.024 --> 04:52.660
that can do this--
- What? Oh, no!

04:52.693 --> 04:53.861
- Oh...
- Oh, no!

04:53.894 --> 04:56.029
Oh!
[shrilly] What up?

04:56.063 --> 04:57.665
You gotta do that!

04:57.698 --> 04:58.666
Oh!

04:58.699 --> 04:59.933
[both laughing]

04:59.967 --> 05:01.769
All right,
you can come with me,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.472
but you gotta be okay
with me wearing this.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.339
- No, no, no.
What is that?

05:05.373 --> 05:07.641
You look like Bell,
Biv, and Devoe.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.510
- Never trust a big butt
and a smile, girl.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.745
- [laughs]

05:11.779 --> 05:13.381
[beep, click, click]

05:13.414 --> 05:15.048
- "Load letter A4"?
What does that even mean?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.917
- Hey! I got
the dry cleaning.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.786
All good--they were
about to close.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.821
- I love you so much.
Can you look at this printer?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.856
Because it hates my guts.
- Yeah, absolutely.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.024
[beeps, hums]
There we go.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.593
- Yes! What would I do
without you?

05:25.626 --> 05:27.595
You're my Mrs. Patmore.
- [British accent] Is that

05:27.628 --> 05:28.662
right?
- [accent] Yeah, it's right!

05:28.696 --> 05:30.664
- Don't mess around
with Thomas.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.733
He's up to no good!
- Argh!

05:32.766 --> 05:34.735
All right, done and done!

05:34.768 --> 05:36.937
- Hey, so I just had
a question for ya.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.138
- Shoot.
- Um...is it okay

05:38.171 --> 05:40.073
if I continue to help you
up until the night,

05:40.107 --> 05:42.109
but then on the actual night,
I don't help you?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.445
- Oh, why?
- Mark asked me to go with him.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.013
- Oh! Oh, okay.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.147
- Yeah, I mean,
just as a friend, like as

05:47.180 --> 05:49.550
- Yeah!
- a wingman with body rolls.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.419
- You know what, I'll just
have to figure out a few things,

05:51.452 --> 05:52.620
but I think that should
be fine.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.622
- Okay. I can tell
from the way you're acting

05:54.655 --> 05:55.856
it's not fine.
- No--

05:55.889 --> 05:56.957
- There is another woman
who asked him,

05:56.990 --> 05:58.526
so he can just go
with her--

05:58.559 --> 05:59.693
- No, I don't wanna--
wait, who's this woman?

05:59.727 --> 06:01.161
- I don't know--her name
is Giselle Zarkovic.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.896
- That's not a real name.
- It is, yeah.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.565
She's a ballistics tech
and she's Argentinean,

06:04.598 --> 06:06.900
half-Croatian, so she's got
those international cheekbones.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.936
- Wow, those are a lot of
different details that makes up

06:08.969 --> 06:10.971
up a different kind of woman--
- She actually kind of

06:11.004 --> 06:13.006
looks like Andie McDowell.
- I never really cared for her

06:13.040 --> 06:15.008
in "Four Weddings
and a Funeral," so...

06:15.042 --> 06:15.943
You know what?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.478
I'm looking through
my list,

06:17.511 --> 06:19.046
and I'm weighing
the options here,

06:19.079 --> 06:20.714
and I actually--I think
you should go with Mark.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.915
- Really?
- Go, I insist.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.852
- Okay, but I'm gonna find the
perfect person to replace me.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.554
- I know, Emma,
I'm not your first choice,

06:26.587 --> 06:27.955
but I'm not gonna
let you down.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.090
Sometimes the substitute teacher
ends up being

06:30.123 --> 06:31.492
the one you like the best.
- Get your hands

06:31.525 --> 06:32.726
out of your pants!
- Aye-aye, Captain.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.894
- Bruce, you're on
water duty tonight.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.529
If you spill on anybody,

06:35.563 --> 06:37.030
I will have you taken
directly to jail.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.899
- That seems harsh,
but absolutely.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.133
Quick question.
- Yes.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.969
- After I'm finished
with my duties,

06:42.002 --> 06:44.137
would it be okay if I...
dance?

06:44.171 --> 06:44.972
- What are you talking
about?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.907
- There's gonna be a lot
of beautiful,

06:46.940 --> 06:48.008
available women
here tonight.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.043
I know that most of them
are gonna be gunning for Mark,

06:50.077 --> 06:51.845
but I'd love to catch
some of that run-off if I could.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.681
- Gross. Yes. Fine.
Do whatever you want.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.915
- Great.
- Can I ask you something?

06:54.948 --> 06:57.618
Do you know anything about
this Giselle Zebra-witch woman?

06:57.651 --> 06:58.786
- Giselle Zarkovic?
- Yeah.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.821
- Oh, she's way out of
my league.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.056
She looks just like
Andie McDowell.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.658
- Uh-huh.
- But warmer.

07:04.692 --> 07:05.926
More spontaneous.
- All right.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.761
Can you get out of my face?
- Absolutely.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.098
[murmurs]

07:11.131 --> 07:12.933
- Hey.
- Oh--what? Wow!

07:12.966 --> 07:14.635
Whoo! I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.969
I am just under
a lot of stress.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.606
I thought you were Bruce,
and I don't like him.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.973
- It's okay.
- Okay.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.008
- Sorry.
- Look at me, look at me.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.510
- Yeah.
- All this...

07:22.543 --> 07:23.811
- Mm-hmm?
- You got it.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.078
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah. You got it.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.980
- No, I know--thank you.
- Okay.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.882
- No, no, no, hey.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.050
Eye contact.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.852
Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.723
- You are exceeding...

07:35.756 --> 07:37.658
every expectation.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.659
- Okay.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.093
Thank you.
- Okay.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.730
- Can I go now, 'cause I just
have some things to...

07:44.898 --> 07:47.100
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you so much, though.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.001
Thanks.
- Of course.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.973
- All right, table eight.
Enjoy your night.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.207
- Hey, hey, hey,
Emma!

07:54.241 --> 07:55.976
- [gasps]
Chief McGrath!

07:56.009 --> 07:58.045
The man of the hour!
Don't you worry.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.548
I got a plate of hot spagetts
coming right to your table.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.149
- You know, you always take
really good care of me.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.718
- You deserve it.
Okay, have a great time.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.688
- Rodriguez.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.823
Sergeant Rodriguez.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.924
- Wow, Mark!

08:10.958 --> 08:12.926
Um...you are in a...

08:12.960 --> 08:14.161
this is a tuxedo.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.996
- Yes, it is.
- Okay! [laughs]

08:16.029 --> 08:17.765
Man, if you were wearing
something like this

08:17.798 --> 08:19.099
at senior prom
instead of that

08:19.132 --> 08:20.934
all-beige
Boyz II Men getup,

08:20.968 --> 08:22.803
maybe you would have
gotten lucky!

08:22.836 --> 08:25.238
- As I recall,
I still did.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.875
- Did you?
Is that what--happened?

08:27.908 --> 08:31.278
I don't have to check
the journals on that one, but...

08:31.311 --> 08:32.646
Where is Maggie?

08:32.680 --> 08:34.114
- Did someone say my name?

08:34.147 --> 08:35.248
Oh, hello.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.552
- Oh, Maggie!
You're stunning!

08:38.586 --> 08:39.720
- Hoo hoo hoo!

08:39.753 --> 08:41.088
- Top to bottom!
- Look at you, girl!

08:41.121 --> 08:43.090
- I just got it
at T.J. Maxx--no big deal.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.958
- Oh, is that it?
It's gorgeous!

08:44.992 --> 08:46.794
- Thank you!
- Let's give you a spin.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.095
- Oh, shall I?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.229
- Mm-hmm.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.000
- Oh...
[all chuckling]

08:53.033 --> 08:55.002
- Oh! You ready
to go, beautiful?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.169
- Well--
- Yes!

08:56.203 --> 08:58.138
She is!

08:58.171 --> 08:59.907
Yes, she is!
She is.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.043
And we can is just
what I was saying.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.945
Well, you better
get in there, you jerks.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.947
You're gonna be
the belles of the ball.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.116
- All right.
- And I'll just--I'll be here...

09:09.149 --> 09:11.051
- Okay.
- If you need anything.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.019
God...

09:12.052 --> 09:13.621
Giselle?

09:13.654 --> 09:14.888
Giselle Zarkovic.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.024
- Wow, you do look like
Andie McDowell.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.926
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, nothing.

09:18.959 --> 09:22.830
I just said that you look
like a friend of mine, um,

09:22.863 --> 09:24.364
Shpandy McSpowell

09:24.397 --> 09:25.933
from high school.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.067
Popular, but slutty.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.936
But not her fault.

09:28.969 --> 09:29.937
'Cause she developed early,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.740
and everyone was like,
"I gotta touch it," so...

09:32.773 --> 09:33.974
Anyway,
you're at table 24.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.343
Great cheekbones.

09:39.012 --> 09:39.212
.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.213
- And now we come to
the highlight of the night,

09:41.281 --> 09:43.216
and that is the award

09:43.250 --> 09:45.052
for the Pinebrook Police
Department's

09:45.085 --> 09:46.954
Officer of the Year.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.789
- Boom, boom, nailed it.
- Since he joined the force,

09:48.822 --> 09:50.758
Mark has single-handedly
transformed law enforcement

09:50.791 --> 09:51.859
right here in Pinebrook,

09:51.892 --> 09:54.027
and somehow he still finds time
to do outreach work

09:54.061 --> 09:56.630
for children with special needs
through Easter Seals...

09:56.664 --> 09:58.165
- Sounds like
a pretty cool guy.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.266
- Hey!
Why didn't you tell me

09:59.299 --> 10:00.701
you were getting an award
tonight?

10:00.734 --> 10:02.235
- You know I don't like
this kinda stuff.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.004
I just...I don't know.
Just didn't tell you.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.205
- Okay.
- Not to mention, by the way,

10:05.238 --> 10:07.675
his daring ice rescue
earlier this year--

10:07.708 --> 10:09.810
Griff Lutski--
and I know Griff is here.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.012
Griff, give us a little wave
or something...

10:12.045 --> 10:14.047
- Come on, man.
Ice rescue?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.049
- Well, yeah.
He was under the ice.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.785
You gotta do something.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.087
- So all the times I thought
you weren't doing police work,

10:20.120 --> 10:22.255
you really were?
- I told you that I was.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.092
So I don't really understand
why you don't believe me.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.960
- I'm still not sold.
- You couldn't ask for

10:26.994 --> 10:29.096
a kinder, more genuine,
and handsome man,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.131
our Officer of the Year,
let's welcome

10:31.164 --> 10:32.866
Sergeant Mark Rodriguez.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.067
- I'll catch you later.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.168
[applause]

10:41.208 --> 10:42.776
- Sneak attack!
Back rub.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.945
- Oh, God. Wow, you
really scared me. Sorry.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.714
- Why so tense?

10:46.747 --> 10:47.881
- Congratulations.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.182
- Whoo!

10:49.216 --> 10:50.984
Whoo!

10:51.018 --> 10:53.286
Whoo!
Whoo!

10:53.320 --> 10:54.955
- Give it a rest,
Andie McDowell.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.389
- What's that?
- Oh, nothing.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.125
Just...do you think
that woman over there

10:58.158 --> 11:00.060
looks like
Andie McDowell?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.095
- Oh, yeah.
Kinda.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.097
- Yeah?
- But younger.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.232
[chuckles]

11:05.265 --> 11:08.235
[hip-hop music]

11:08.268 --> 11:14.975
*

11:16.109 --> 11:16.944
- Boss! Hey, boss!

11:16.977 --> 11:18.779
- Yeah.
- All right, tables are cleared.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.080
Sauces are legally married.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.049
Is it all right if I hit
the dance floor?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.483
- Sure, Bruce.
I saw...

11:23.516 --> 11:25.218
Andie McDowell
out there.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.820
You gonna make
your move?

11:26.854 --> 11:28.455
- Naw. Think she's got
the hots for Mark.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.390
- Oh, I don't know,
Bruce.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.892
What if you were
to go out there,

11:31.925 --> 11:33.761
tap her on the shoulder,
and show her what you got?

11:33.794 --> 11:36.396
- Me? Ah...
I'm just the water guy.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.832
- Bruce...
on the dance floor,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.868
[whispers]
anything's possible.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.970
- Roger that.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.004
No.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.973
Roger Rabbit that!

11:47.040 --> 11:49.743
- Oh, I don't know.
That wasn't--okay.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.187
What are you doing, Emma?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.489
Just stop doing it.
Just stop it.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.457
- Oh, hey!

12:04.491 --> 12:06.426
- Oh, God.
- What are you doing in here?

12:06.459 --> 12:07.995
- Nothing.
I'm just, um...

12:08.028 --> 12:09.362
- You have Capital D?

12:09.396 --> 12:12.232
- No. No, I'm just
having some, um,

12:12.265 --> 12:14.802
some feelings in here
that I'm not comfortable with.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.070
- And that's not Capital D?
'Cause I have a whole--

12:17.104 --> 12:18.371
- Just, um...
- Oh, God,

12:18.405 --> 12:20.107
you're coming in close.
- I'm having feelings.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.241
- Okay.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.375
- Like, um...
- What kind of feelings?

12:22.409 --> 12:23.944
- Like I'm looking
at Mark,

12:23.977 --> 12:25.813
and then I'm having
feelings.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.414
So what are these
feelings, Maggie?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.249
- I-I don't know.
What are they?

12:29.282 --> 12:31.919
- They're just that
I wanna be into it...

12:31.952 --> 12:34.822
and onto it
[whispers] and beside it!

12:34.855 --> 12:36.957
- Okay, so you're having
like a surge of heat

12:36.990 --> 12:38.058
and attraction.
- Yes!

12:38.091 --> 12:39.860
And why am I having
these feelings?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.528
Because things are
finally good with Dan!

12:41.561 --> 12:43.396
And why wouldn't I want
to throw away

12:43.430 --> 12:46.066
a perfectly great relationship
with a perfectly great guy

12:46.099 --> 12:48.135
and instead,
move over to a guy

12:48.168 --> 12:51.171
who wears a garbage bag
on his day off?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.539
- Okay, I need you
to calm down--

12:52.572 --> 12:54.374
- And I have a bone
to pick with you.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.976
Yes, I do!

12:56.009 --> 12:58.111
'Cause you are the one
that got him that great tux!

12:58.145 --> 12:59.312
Where did you get that tux?

12:59.346 --> 13:03.083
- Well, the other options were
Jon Secada and "King and I"--

13:03.116 --> 13:04.517
- Either one of them
would have been better!

13:04.551 --> 13:05.652
Oh, God, maybe that's it.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.320
Maybe I wouldn't be
having these feelings

13:07.354 --> 13:09.456
if he wasn't wearing
a tux!

13:12.993 --> 13:14.461
- I don't know, Em.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.563
I mean, weren't you having
these feelings

13:16.596 --> 13:19.399
when he was wearing
a garbage bag?

13:23.103 --> 13:26.940
And weren't you feeling
these same...feelings

13:26.974 --> 13:29.843
when you were 17 and you
saw him for the first time?

13:31.344 --> 13:34.047
- All right, what are you
doing, man?

13:34.081 --> 13:36.416
- I'm just--
- Get out of my brain, okay?

13:36.449 --> 13:39.119
I'm not interested
in your lady tricks, all right?

13:39.152 --> 13:42.022
If this is some sort of
reverse psychology situation,

13:42.055 --> 13:43.390
then I--
Okay, I know.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.958
I know what I need
to do.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.359
I need to recommit
to Dan.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.061
That's it.
- No, that's not at all

13:48.095 --> 13:50.130
what I'm saying.
- Well, whatever you are saying

13:50.163 --> 13:52.032
is not helpful!
- Oh, my God.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.566
- You were terrible
in "Accidental Tourist"--P.S.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.070
- Oh, that was Geena Davis.
I'm so sorry.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.539
- [humming]

13:59.572 --> 14:01.975
[dance music plays]

14:02.009 --> 14:03.543
- Hey, you and me,
dance floor.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.045
- Oh, no, you don't
want me out there.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.279
- Yes, I do want you
out there.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.881
- No, you don't want this.
- Yes, yes.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.649
- I'm not much of a dancer.
- I do--I do want this.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.152
- Okay. I'm sorry
you've got to see this.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.287
Okay, all right.
- What are you doing?

14:14.321 --> 14:16.456
- Hey, don't laugh.
This is my dance.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.158
- This is your dance?
- Mm-hmm.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.928
- You look like a balloon man
at the top of a car dealership.

14:20.961 --> 14:25.232
- [humming]

14:25.265 --> 14:27.935
- Can we not--
can we stop this?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.002
- Oh, thank God!

14:29.036 --> 14:30.971
[slow music begins]
- I don't know

14:31.004 --> 14:32.172
if I can unsee that.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.041
- Thank you for
bringing me tonight.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.043
I had a good time.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.610
- [sighs]

- What you eye-balling
over there?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.018
- What? Nothing.
Nothing.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.020
- Yeah, you are.
You're staring straight at Em.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.188
- Yeah, but you don't have
to worry,

14:48.221 --> 14:49.389
'cause my jets are cool.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.324
I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.560
Okay, um...
[sighs]

14:53.593 --> 14:55.262
Maybe you just, uh...

14:55.295 --> 14:57.464
[mumbles] turn 'em on.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.933
- I'm sorry--I'm not--
What did you say? What?

14:59.967 --> 15:01.534
- [mumbling] Maybe you
should turn your jets on.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.303
- Turn my whats on?
- Turn those jets on.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.938
- Are you saying turn
my jets on--are you saying--

15:04.972 --> 15:05.872
- Turn your jets on!
- Thank you!

15:05.905 --> 15:07.607
- I'm saying it out loud.
- But why? Why?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.642
- Just 'cause information
has come to light, okay?

15:09.676 --> 15:11.544
And I can't get into
the specifics, but--

15:11.578 --> 15:13.180
- What specifics? What--
What information?

15:13.213 --> 15:13.846
- What happens
in a ladies' bathroom

15:13.880 --> 15:16.183
stays in a ladies'
bathroom.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.385
I've already said too much.
- No, no, no, no--

15:18.418 --> 15:20.220
- Sorry. Oh, shit.
- * I love to move it, move it

15:20.253 --> 15:23.123
Bruce? It's our song.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.325
- * Move it!
- Whoo!

15:30.097 --> 15:30.430
.

15:30.463 --> 15:30.897
[upbeat dance music]

15:33.333 --> 15:36.036
- Well, Maggie and Bruce
are really taking over.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.005
- Oh, yeah.
They always did

15:38.038 --> 15:39.306
their best work
on the dance floor.

15:39.339 --> 15:43.643
*

15:43.676 --> 15:49.249
- I'm sorry, has anyone seen
the Officer of the Year?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.119
[loud cheers]

15:52.152 --> 15:54.087
*

15:54.121 --> 15:56.589
- Okay, okay, everybody,
wait a second.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.725
Everybody, take it easy.

15:58.758 --> 16:02.662
Listen, somebody is gonna have
to call for backup...

16:02.695 --> 16:05.732
because this officer...
is gettin' down.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.001
What?
- Whoo!

16:08.035 --> 16:12.572
*

16:12.605 --> 16:14.207
- You should
get out there.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.308
- No, no, no.
- You know, I was thinking,

16:15.342 --> 16:17.144
I should be getting
anyway.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.545
I-I got to be up early
for morning services.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.147
- Are you sure?
- Please, yeah.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.548
I want you to be
with your friends.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.183
- Oh, okay.
- I'm gonna see you at my...

16:23.216 --> 16:25.252
place later?
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.187
- Well...
- Hey, thank you

16:27.220 --> 16:29.556
for...everything.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.258
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.460
Whatever you need.

16:35.695 --> 16:43.336
*

16:56.083 --> 16:58.118
- What are you doing
out here, Emma?

16:58.151 --> 17:01.088
- I was just, um,
checking to see

17:01.121 --> 17:03.623
if these vines
were still growing.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.759
- Oh, yeah? What's, uh...
what's the verdict?

17:06.793 --> 17:09.129
- Guilty.
I mean good.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.464
It's all--
it's all good.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.700
Hey, congrats again
on the award.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.202
You deserve it.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.836
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

17:16.869 --> 17:21.208
- Last year, a drug-sniffing
pig won the same award.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.342
- Do you think you
could introduce me,

17:22.375 --> 17:23.610
'cause I would love
to get an autograph.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.078
- Well, you know,
he's the commissioner now,

17:25.112 --> 17:28.548
so, he might be busy.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.683
- Hey, where's your medal?
You should be wearing it.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.585
- Oh, I'm not going to wear it.
No, no, come on.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.222
- My God, if I had a medal,
I would wear it all the time.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.290
- Do you want to try
mine on?

17:37.324 --> 17:40.093
- Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.838
Oh, man.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.542
This is tough stuff.

17:55.575 --> 18:00.813
I would very much like
to kiss you right now, but--

18:00.847 --> 18:02.615
- You have a boyfriend.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.685
And you're not
that kind of girl.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.155
- No.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.358
- And I'm not
that kind of guy.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.194
But, uh, if I was
that kind of guy...

18:14.227 --> 18:15.895
- Yeah?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.765
- I would put my hand
on the small of your back.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.233
- Uh-huh.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.736
- And then I would brush
the hair out of your face.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.540
- And then I would tilt
my face.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.210
- Up towards my--
- Lips.

18:35.182 --> 18:40.753
- But we're not--
we're not those people.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.856
And the last time...

18:43.890 --> 18:47.327
I don't know that
I can do that again.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.366
Unless...

18:53.400 --> 18:54.867
- Conga!

18:54.901 --> 18:57.704
[shouting]

18:57.737 --> 18:59.472
[cheering]

18:59.506 --> 19:02.442
- Dance with us!

19:06.246 --> 19:09.182
[soft piano music]

19:09.216 --> 19:17.224
*

19:43.416 --> 19:43.616
.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.150
- Hey.
- Morning, Mags.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.353
Made you breakfast.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.354
I wasn't sure
if you would be hungry

19:47.387 --> 19:48.888
but I was starvin' majarvin.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.022
- That's really sweet.
Thank you, Bruce.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.859
- Yeah. And Mary Pat's on her
way over with Charlotte.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.861
I made you some coffee.
Half and half and sugar.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.962
That's how you like it,
right?

19:55.995 --> 19:57.764
- Yeah.

19:57.797 --> 20:01.301
Um, Bruce, last night
was, um, crazy.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.002
- Yeah.
And real fun, right?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.305
- Actually, it was real fun.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.975
I just want to make sure that
you and I are on the same page.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.010
- Mags, you can
stop right there.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.346
- Okay.
- Last night was a one-off.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.682
It's like the movie
"Daredevil" or "Gremlins 2."

20:15.715 --> 20:18.285
But nonetheless I had
a very enjoyable experience

20:18.318 --> 20:20.687
and for that, I thank you.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.021
- Oh, well, I'm just happy it
all still works down there,

20:22.054 --> 20:23.022
you know?

20:23.055 --> 20:23.823
- Let me assure you, madam,

20:23.856 --> 20:25.892
everything is in
tip-top condition.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.694
Really. Fantastic stuff.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.961
- Thank you.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.564
[laughs]

20:31.598 --> 20:33.933
- Morning, Emma.
- Hey, Bruce.

20:33.966 --> 20:34.934
What is Bruce doing here?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.836
- Wh--where were you
last night?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.705
- I broke up with Dan.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.308
- Aw, Rabby Dan?
I'm sorry.

20:41.341 --> 20:45.878
Oh, it's okay. Here, sit down.
Bruce made us pancakes.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.448
- Wait, did you have sex
with Bruce?

20:48.481 --> 20:51.017
- One thing at a time.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.420
- Did it all work
down there?

20:53.453 --> 20:55.455
- Right as rain.
