WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:06.607
Nate, you ready to hit it?

00:06.640 --> 00:09.377
Oh, not yet. See that blonde
doing yoga over there?

00:09.410 --> 00:11.712
My mom said something to
her a couple minutes ago,

00:11.745 --> 00:13.681
and she's been flirting
with me ever since.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.684
(Ray laughs)

00:16.717 --> 00:18.219
Peekaboo!

00:18.252 --> 00:20.188
She's ready to freakaboo,
I'm telling you.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.389
Hit her back.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.057
All right.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.660
(laughs)
I don't know what
my mom said to her,

00:26.694 --> 00:27.695
but for once, she's
actually helping.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.463
What you waiting for?
Go over there,

00:29.497 --> 00:30.664
talk to her,
get her phone number.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.233
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.535
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
you misunderstood me.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.305
I said my son, Nathan,
was highly regarded.

00:37.338 --> 00:42.143
Oh. Then why were you
playing peekaboo with me?

00:44.645 --> 00:47.148
I don't know.
You started it.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.711
I'm not lying. My uncle's
real name is Carmine Electra.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.882
What's with the ice pack
and the scissors?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.284
Your father came
over this morning.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.887
He woke up with gum
in his hair... again.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.789
Strange thing is,
I don't chew gum.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.758
It makes my jawline
too defined,

01:30.791 --> 01:33.761
and everyone mistakes
me for Jon Hamm.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.663
Ouch! You're
hurting me!

01:35.696 --> 01:38.132
Just chug a beer
and let her rip it out.

01:38.166 --> 01:41.502
That's how I get though waxing.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.172
If I'd known you two had been
back so early

01:44.205 --> 01:45.639
I would have made us all lunch.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.708
Lunch? It's 4:00.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.877
4:00?! It can't be 4:00!

01:49.910 --> 01:51.912
I have a dentist appointment
at 4:00.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.915
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Help me find my purse!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.517
Mom, why are you flipping out?

01:56.550 --> 01:57.918
Just reschedule.
I can't!

01:57.951 --> 01:59.253
The receptionist said

01:59.287 --> 02:00.788
they have a strict
cancellation policy.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.290
It's $75!

02:02.323 --> 02:04.658
Mom, relax,
it's just $75.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.694
Just $75?! What's next?

02:06.727 --> 02:09.230
Just a little heroin?
Just a little murder?!

02:09.263 --> 02:11.399
What about
my hair?!

02:11.432 --> 02:12.466
Ow!

02:12.500 --> 02:13.534
You don't like it,

02:13.567 --> 02:14.502
find a girlfriend
already

02:14.535 --> 02:16.837
so someone else can cut
things off your body.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.873
Let's go! Move it!
Move it! Move it! Move it!

02:21.909 --> 02:23.777
Okay, here's our story:

02:23.811 --> 02:27.548
we were late because we were
planning you and Ray's wedding.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.651
No one's gonna mess
with a biracial gay couple.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.487
Listen, I'm not lying, okay?
I-I am a trusted member

02:33.521 --> 02:35.723
of the WXDN news team,
and I took an oath

02:35.756 --> 02:37.191
to always tell the truth.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.860
And to never get fat.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.595
Well, we better come up
with something.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.932
A good excuse doesn't
just fall out of the sky.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.536
(elevator bell dings)

02:50.938 --> 02:53.341
I want nothing to do with this.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.844
Oh, my God.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.888
Sorry.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.590
Are you okay?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.825
I'm just learning to use
this wheelchair.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.328
I sprained both my ankles
this morning

03:14.362 --> 03:15.996
chasing after a baby thief.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.599
Poor thing!

03:18.632 --> 03:20.634
Actually, I was here
over an hour ago,

03:20.668 --> 03:23.537
but as I was coming in,
I noticed a mother duck

03:23.571 --> 03:25.806
and eight little ducklings
wandering into traffic.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.808
I couldn't help myself.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.878
I gathered them all up and gave
them a ride to the lake.

03:30.911 --> 03:31.879
Oh.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.615
That's why I'm so late

03:34.648 --> 03:36.684
for my appointment
with Dr. Vega.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.287
You must be Carol Miller?

03:39.320 --> 03:40.921
Let me look and see
if there's another time

03:40.954 --> 03:42.990
Dr. Vega can squeeze you in.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.458
Thank you, sweetheart.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.731
Wow, Nathan, check it out.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.733
Hot dentist.

03:52.766 --> 03:53.734
If they all
looked like that,

03:53.767 --> 03:56.404
this country wouldn't
have such bad breath.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.005
Man, she is cute.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.408
All right, dibs.
What?

04:00.441 --> 04:01.909
Dibs. I'm calling dibs.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.977
Dibs? Dibs are something
white people invented

04:04.011 --> 04:05.613
so it makes it okay to steal.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.981
Listen, hey, the only
reason we're here

04:08.015 --> 04:09.717
is because of my
mom's appointment.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.885
When we take your mother to
her dentist, you get dibs.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.389
You know damn well my mom
doesn't have any teeth.

04:15.423 --> 04:19.760
All right, all right, how about,
uh, rock, paper, scissors?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.895
Fine. One, two, three.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.063
Go!
Yes, I win!
Paper beats rock.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.900
In what world does paper beat
rock? If we were in a alley

04:26.934 --> 04:29.837
and you came at me with a piece
of paper and I had a rock,

04:29.870 --> 04:31.339
I would beat your ass!

04:32.906 --> 04:35.509
Listen, tell you what.
If you back down,

04:35.543 --> 04:38.779
I promise that I'll let you
pick the radio station
in the van,

04:38.812 --> 04:41.349
and I'll drive
so you can stick
your head out the sunroof.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.951
Fine. One last thing.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.320
For the next week,
every time you see me,

04:46.354 --> 04:47.688
you have to curtsy.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.022
Fine.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.761
Excuse me.
Uh, can you tell me
where the bathroom is?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.629
(Spanish accent):
The door to your left.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.931
Oh. Kind of messes up my plan.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.468
You have a bathroom plan?

05:00.501 --> 05:03.070
Uh, the idea was that
I'd ask for the bathroom,

05:03.103 --> 05:04.938
and then you'd give me
complicated directions,

05:04.972 --> 05:07.641
probably involving a key
and a giant toothbrush,

05:07.675 --> 05:09.810
and I'd make a joke like,
"Oh, does Julia Roberts know

05:09.843 --> 05:11.044
that you stole her toothbrush?"

05:11.078 --> 05:12.980
Because she's got a really
big mouth.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.915
Anyway, you make a charming
comment in return,

05:14.948 --> 05:16.083
and by the time
I actually got the key,

05:16.116 --> 05:17.985
we'd be making plans
involving you and me

05:18.018 --> 05:19.920
and your favorite restaurant.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.555
Was that your plan?

05:21.589 --> 05:23.924
Or was your plan to talk about
how your plan failed

05:23.957 --> 05:26.627
and come off as endearingly
frazzled in the process?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.995
Maybe, I don't know.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.063
I'm actually kind
of too frazzled to say.

05:31.965 --> 05:32.933
Psst, check it out.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.536
Got her number,
we're going out Saturday night.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.037
Oh, good for you.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.907
Now grab that imaginary
skirt and get low.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.545
For real.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.788
Okay, Mrs. Miller,
how is day after
tomorrow same time?

05:54.822 --> 05:55.956
Will that work?

05:55.989 --> 05:57.057
Oh, perfect.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.792
I gotta tell ya,

05:58.826 --> 06:01.729
I've really been stressing out
about that cancellation fee.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.698
Oh, no-no-no-no-no,
don't stress.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.800
It's only $75.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.103
How would you like to pay,
with the credit card on file?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.375
Yeah, go ahead,
charge the card.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.112
Dad, how does this
keep happening?

06:19.146 --> 06:22.583
I swear, I'm not going to
bed with gum in my mouth.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.619
There's only one
logical explanation:

06:25.653 --> 06:28.055
gum I swallowed years ago
is working its way

06:28.088 --> 06:31.659
up my body and
out my mouth.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.528
Not possible. Even if the body
can't process something,

06:34.562 --> 06:36.029
it'll end up coming out
the other end.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.531
When Mikayla was four,

06:37.565 --> 06:39.900
she ate the entire contents
of a dollhouse.

06:39.933 --> 06:40.968
Everything came out,

06:41.001 --> 06:43.904
but it was no longer
a dream house.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.909
Hey, uh, Deb, where
are Adam's crutches

06:48.942 --> 06:50.478
from his leg
extension surgery?

06:50.511 --> 06:51.745
They weren't
in the garage.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.547
I'm not sure. Why?

06:53.581 --> 06:56.083
I need them for my dentist
appointment tomorrow.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.019
I can't go straight
from a wheelchair to walking.

06:59.052 --> 07:02.590
Even in my lies
I have integrity.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.625
My crutches are in the basement.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.026
Along with my old leg braces

07:06.059 --> 07:08.095
and my signed Michael Jordan
jersey.

07:08.128 --> 07:08.962
There was some confusion.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.931
They thought I was
a Make-A-Wish kid.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.707
Hey, listen, Deb,
I need a favor.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.709
Uh! You can't keep borrowing
my concealer.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.677
Just buy your own.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.679
What? I don't use concealer.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.980
Listen, (clears throat)

07:27.014 --> 07:29.817
No, no, I need you
to take Mom to her
appointment tomorrow.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.752
I got a date with
her new dentist,

07:31.785 --> 07:34.021
and I don't need her
interrogating her
before that.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.656
Oh, date with a dentist.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.725
Hey, is she any good?
We're gonna need a new dentist

07:37.758 --> 07:39.493
with Dad's nighttime
gum addiction.

07:39.527 --> 07:42.996
I don't chew gum! I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.534
Debbie, where is
that pink teddy bear
nanny cam you bought?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.468
Um, it's in our bedroom.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.906
Wait a second.
There's a camera in our bedroom?

07:52.940 --> 07:54.074
I'm an athlete, okay?

07:54.107 --> 07:55.843
I get better by looking
at game tape.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.982
Listen, Deb, what do you say?
Will you take her?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.551
Come on. I need to see
if there's a connection

08:03.584 --> 08:06.119
with this woman
before Mom can interfere.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.055
You know how Mom can make things
more complicated

08:08.088 --> 08:09.289
than they need to be.

08:09.322 --> 08:14.161
(squeaking, clanking)

08:14.194 --> 08:17.064
I, uh, went with
the leg braces.

08:17.097 --> 08:20.067
No.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.637
Adam, how did you ever walk
in these things?

08:23.671 --> 08:24.705
Oh, I didn't.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.907
I rode piggyback on my mom
and used her necklace

08:26.940 --> 08:28.208
to steer her like a horse.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.156
Okay, fine, I'll take
her to the dentist.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.658
But mostly because
I want to see

08:44.692 --> 08:46.059
when Optimus Prime
over there

08:46.093 --> 08:49.162
transforms herself
back into a tractor trailer.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.101
Mom, is all this
really necessary?

08:54.134 --> 08:57.571
I want every step
I take, every spark
I make to remind her

08:57.605 --> 09:01.675
of the $75 fee
she took from
a fake invalid.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.912
Oh, Mrs. Miller!

09:04.945 --> 09:10.183
Hello, there. Day by day,
getting stronger and stronger.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.219
I was just about to call you.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.255
Unfortunately,
Dr. Vega needs to cancel.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.957
Cancel?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.292
A patient emergency came up.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.794
Did it?

09:20.828 --> 09:22.229
Interesting.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.932
We will have to reschedule.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.233
No problem.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.903
So, how would you like
to handle this?

09:29.937 --> 09:32.139
I take cash, or you can just
refund the money

09:32.172 --> 09:34.775
to my credit card.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.143
Excuse me?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.612
I also have a strict
cancellation policy.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.180
$75.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.915
I see what you're driving at,

09:41.949 --> 09:44.284
but this was an unforeseen
emergency.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.286
And my two broken feet weren't?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.889
First, I thought
they were sprained.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.258
Second, you're not getting
any money.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.294
Then I'm gonna have
to get my $75 another way.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.765
Four dollars-worth
of butterscotch.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.800
Ah, that lamp looks nice.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.202
Okay, uh, Mom...

10:02.235 --> 10:03.837
You can't be
serious.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.273
Oh, she's very serious.
Oh, I'm very serious.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.809
Security?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.110
Hey. Hi, there.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.912
Hey, listen, um, usually
I'm the first person

10:11.945 --> 10:14.047
to do the whole crazy lady
signal behind her back,

10:14.081 --> 10:16.016
but, you know, maybe since
you're canceling on her

10:16.049 --> 10:18.986
right after she paid
your fee, you just bend
the rules a little bit.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.321
Are you seriously closing
that in my face? Oh, my God,

10:21.354 --> 10:24.124
for real?!
Okay, crazy lady, do your thing!

10:24.157 --> 10:26.827
Quick, stick
your hand in.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.328
Herd a couple of
those sea horses

10:28.361 --> 10:30.964
into my cup.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.667
Get in there!
Giddyup!
Get in there!

10:38.238 --> 10:40.708
I want to thank you
all for coming.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.743
I have an announcement to make.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.712
After much heartfelt
deliberation,

10:44.745 --> 10:47.147
I have decided
to add another business

10:47.180 --> 10:49.449
to the Miller's boycott list.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.184
(all groaning)

10:51.218 --> 10:52.786
What's the boycott list?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.122
Over the years, Mom has compiled
a list of businesses

10:55.155 --> 10:56.389
that have wronged her
one way or another.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.958
Oh, not just businesses.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.727
Bradbury Park
is on the list.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.862
I don't care if the placard says
it's an orchid.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.431
That new fountain
looks like a vagina.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.434
Once my mom puts
something on the list,

11:07.467 --> 11:08.736
we're not allowed
to go there anymore.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.204
And the new entry is...

11:11.238 --> 11:14.207
Please be school,
please be school.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.043
Dr. Sonia Vega's Dental Center.

11:16.076 --> 11:16.810
What?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.712
This time Dr. Vega
cancelled on me.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.714
But they wouldn't honor
my $75 fee.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.716
So I tried to even the score

11:22.750 --> 11:24.785
by liberating
a few items from her office.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.453
Long story short,

11:26.486 --> 11:28.956
it's not easy scaling

11:28.989 --> 11:31.058
a chain-link fence
in leg braces.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.194
You know what else isn't easy
to do with leg braces?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.830
Get a date to homecoming.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.735
I've made laminated wallet-sized
copies of the updated list.

11:41.769 --> 11:42.736
Pass these around.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.004
Now, if you'll excuse me,

11:44.037 --> 11:46.506
I'm going to prank call
Dr. Vega's office.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.808
(laughs)

11:47.841 --> 11:49.777
How do I block
caller ID again?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.845
Star 67.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.947
CAROL:
Thank you.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.949
Debbie, this is exactly
the kind of disaster

11:55.983 --> 11:56.984
I was trying to avoid.

11:57.017 --> 11:57.985
How did this happen?!

11:58.018 --> 11:58.986
I don't know.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.320
I mean, the receptionist closed

12:00.353 --> 12:01.889
the window in my face,
and the next thing I knew,

12:01.922 --> 12:03.023
I was running
across the parking lot

12:03.056 --> 12:05.292
with a cup full of fish!

12:05.325 --> 12:06.393
All is not lost.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.763
Now I get a chance to swoop in
on the sexy dentist.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.765
No, there's gonna be
no swooping, Ray, okay?

12:11.799 --> 12:13.233
I'm not gonna let
Mom ruin this for me.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.534
I'm keeping my date with Sonia.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.236
DEBBIE:
But she's on the list.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.238
If Mom finds out, you're asking
for a lot of drama.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.306
She's not gonna find out,

12:19.339 --> 12:22.075
'cause I'm making dinner
reservations at Antonio's.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.076
(all gasp)

12:23.110 --> 12:24.144
Nathan, you can't go there.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.512
Antonio's was what started

12:25.545 --> 12:27.280
this whole boycott list.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.049
That's how she'll never know.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.218
There's no reason that Sonia
has to pass the Mom test

12:31.251 --> 12:33.486
before she passes
the Nathan test.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.856
Questions such as,
but not limited to:

12:35.889 --> 12:37.457
Does she like hockey?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.793
Is she okay
with my monthly spa day?

12:39.827 --> 12:40.994
Does she have
an attractive sneeze?

12:41.028 --> 12:43.196
I mean... like, there's no way
I would've married Janice

12:43.230 --> 12:44.564
if I'd known
that her sneeze was like

12:44.597 --> 12:47.300
the flush of an airplane toilet.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.502
I can't believe
you're going to Antonio's.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.339
Geez, I miss
those garlic knots.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.541
The garlic knots.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.476
What are garlic knots?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.311
Oh, they're just
the most delicious, plump,

12:58.345 --> 13:00.480
doughy bread puffs
you've ever tasted.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.549
How could I put this in terms
that you'd understand?

13:02.582 --> 13:04.551
Um, if a One Direction song

13:04.584 --> 13:07.087
was made out of bread,
that would be it.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.489
Yummy!

13:09.522 --> 13:11.558
Hey, you bring us back
some of those garlic knots,

13:11.591 --> 13:12.926
and we won't say a word.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.061
Deal.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.896
What did Antonio's
ever do to your mom?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.264
They wouldn't let her in
because she wasn't wearing

13:17.297 --> 13:19.132
a jacket and a tie.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.868
She had a very short
haircut at the time.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.236
It wasn't a fun ride home.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.075
It's a shame
Nathan's working tonight.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.979
That "meatless meat loaf"
was really interesting.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.881
Oh, did you like it?

13:33.914 --> 13:34.882
"Yes."

13:36.083 --> 13:37.217
Well, it took me
a couple of times

13:37.250 --> 13:38.318
to get it to work,
but I finally

13:38.351 --> 13:39.552
got the teddy bear cam

13:39.586 --> 13:41.054
to record me sleeping.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.891
And it turns out,
I'm not an idiot.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.092
That's right, Tom.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.194
You're highly regarded.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.831
(snoring)

13:58.638 --> 14:01.574
(snoring)

14:15.388 --> 14:17.925
Wow!

14:17.958 --> 14:20.894
That kid looks
just like me.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.631
Mikayla, why would you do that?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.099
Now, don't be too mad at her.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.367
We share a wall,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.302
and my snoring was obviously

14:29.336 --> 14:30.904
keeping her up.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.974
And interrupting my dreams
about One Direction.

14:34.007 --> 14:37.945
I was just trying to give his
mouth something else to do.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.947
I suffered through
his snoring for years.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.281
The only thing worse was

14:41.314 --> 14:43.583
when he'd stop breathing
for a minute.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.485
Such a tease.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.221
Now, honey, why wouldn't you
just say something?

14:48.255 --> 14:49.356
I mean, it's not right to lie.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.557
I never lied.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.125
If anyone had asked me

14:52.159 --> 14:53.994
if I was putting gum
in Grandpa's mouth

14:54.027 --> 14:56.329
when he was sleeping,
I would've said yes.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.299
Sweetheart, not saying something

14:59.332 --> 15:00.633
is the same thing as lying.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.702
Sometimes it's even sneakier

15:02.735 --> 15:04.637
than an outright fib.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.039
I didn't think
of it that way.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.240
Sorry.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.509
So, I guess we
should tell Grandma

15:09.542 --> 15:11.111
where Uncle Nate
really is tonight.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.093
I can tell I'm on a date
with a TV reporter.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.494
You ask a ton of questions,

15:27.527 --> 15:31.164
and I think you might still
be wearing a little makeup?

15:31.198 --> 15:32.699
No, it's not, it's not makeup.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.201
It's just, uh, blush, gloss

15:34.234 --> 15:36.103
and a little bit of liner
to pop the... Anyway!

15:36.136 --> 15:37.037
(clears throat)

15:37.070 --> 15:39.206
You are just such
an interesting subject.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.673
You know, it's not
every day that I meet

15:40.707 --> 15:43.676
a hockey fan who's also open
to a his and hers spa day.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.045
Why would two people not want

15:45.078 --> 15:46.513
to be on the same
hair-removal cycle?

15:48.081 --> 15:49.983
Okay, it's my turn
to ask the question.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.118
Sure, ask me anything you want.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.520
Actually, you know what?
First, does this pepper smell

15:53.553 --> 15:54.988
a little bit weird?

15:56.023 --> 15:58.058
(sniffs)

15:58.091 --> 16:00.060
(sneezes)

16:00.093 --> 16:02.695
Oh, like a baby panda.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.097
Mom.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.198
Hello, Nathan.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.634
Oh, you must be
Dr. Sonia Vega.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.269
Nice to meet you.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.470
What are you doing here?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.771
A little birdie told me

16:11.804 --> 16:13.040
that you were bringing some

16:13.073 --> 16:14.707
of Antonio's famous garlic knots

16:14.741 --> 16:17.244
home to the family, so I decided
to save you the trouble

16:17.277 --> 16:19.012
and pick them up myself.

16:19.046 --> 16:22.449
I'm going to go check to see
if our table is ready.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.252
Okay, um... listen...

16:25.285 --> 16:26.586
Hey, listen, I'm...
I'm really sorry.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.089
I-I promise my mom doesn't
usually show up on dates.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.223
Oh, take your time.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.725
(sneezes)

16:32.759 --> 16:34.061
Oh.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.096
Adorable.

16:36.129 --> 16:39.099
God, I hope she has allergies.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.667
Of all the restaurants

16:40.700 --> 16:42.469
and all the dentists
in Loudoun County, you had...

16:42.502 --> 16:43.770
Mom, before you start in,

16:43.803 --> 16:44.771
I'm sorry, okay?

16:44.804 --> 16:47.040
But you got to understand

16:47.074 --> 16:49.676
that I'm not exactly a
spring chicken, okay?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.644
Y-Yes, maybe I want to get
married again one day.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.613
So when I meet somebody I
like, I got to move on it.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.816
No matter what your stupid
boycott list says.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.751
And-and Sonia's great.

16:58.785 --> 17:02.389
She and I are the exact
number of episodes behind

17:02.422 --> 17:04.657
on Downton Abbey.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.694
So, you really
like this girl, huh?

17:07.727 --> 17:09.162
I'm starting to.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.397
Then you know what?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.165
I can let this go.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.201
There are more
important things in life.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.602
Like my son's happiness,

17:15.635 --> 17:17.270
and me getting more grandbabies.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.407
I've knit so many things
for the neighbor's dog

17:20.440 --> 17:22.109
he stopped growing fur.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.843
Thanks, Mom.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.845
Enjoy your date.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.448
Gentlemen, can I top these
garlic knots off for you?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.117
(sniffs)
Mmm.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.718
Hello, old friends.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.686
My grudge was never with you.

17:36.756 --> 17:37.657
Did your mom leave?

17:37.690 --> 17:41.094
Yeah, she had to go back
to our... her house.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.429
Our table's ready.
I-I just want

17:42.462 --> 17:44.164
to pay the bartender
for our drinks.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.165
Oh, here, let me get it.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.166
Oh, no, no.
I have a $100 bill

17:46.199 --> 17:48.568
I need to break anyway.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.702
Wait a minute.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.271
All I have is a $20

17:51.304 --> 17:52.405
and five

17:52.439 --> 17:54.641
crumpled ones.

17:54.674 --> 17:58.278
I know for a fact that I had
a $100 bill in here.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.213
What kind of lunatic
would rob somebody

18:00.247 --> 18:02.215
and leave them change?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.524
Oh, you're home early.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.893
Yeah, of course I'm home early.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.762
Sonia's appetite dwindled
when she learned

18:15.795 --> 18:18.465
that my mother stole $75
out of her purse.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.167
You told her?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.100
Yeah, I had to.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.769
She caught me
with my hand in her purse,

18:22.802 --> 18:24.737
trying to put money back in.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.173
Tried to tell her
I was reaching for moisturizer,

18:26.206 --> 18:27.073
but she didn't believe me

18:27.106 --> 18:30.177
'cause my stupid skin
is so flawless.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.511
I can't believe you gave her
the money back.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.146
The score was even.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.215
We can't start a relationship
with this woman

18:35.248 --> 18:37.250
on an uneven playing field.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.251
"We"?

18:38.285 --> 18:39.352
You know what?
(laughs)

18:39.386 --> 18:40.420
That's actually
the hardest reality

18:40.453 --> 18:41.754
of this situation.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.623
Not only do I have
to find a woman who is

18:43.656 --> 18:45.625
smart, pretty and funny,

18:45.658 --> 18:47.360
she's also got to be willing
to date my mom.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.895
Let's face it,
my odds are slim.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.430
(knocking)

18:50.463 --> 18:53.366
Ah. Oh, that's probably Debbie

18:53.400 --> 18:55.368
bringing leftover
"meatless meat loaf"

18:55.402 --> 18:58.271
because she doesn't
understand "sarcasm."

19:00.807 --> 19:01.741
Sonia.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.177
I'm sorry I overreacted.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.313
I've never been robbed
by a date's mother.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.782
In Cuba, it's always
the father who does it.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.819
Collecting a debt
is not robbery.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.587
Mom!
No, no. She has a point.

19:14.621 --> 19:18.191
I thought about it and, Nathan,
you should take your money back.

19:18.225 --> 19:21.194
I don't want this to be hanging
over our heads on our next date.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.662
No, l-listen. I'm-I'm sorry.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.364
I-I can't ta...

19:24.397 --> 19:26.666
Wait, did, did you say
"next date"?

19:27.967 --> 19:29.502
That's very big of you.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.970
And in that same spirit,

19:31.003 --> 19:32.705
I feel I should tell you

19:32.739 --> 19:35.808
I'm the one who hung up on
your receptionist 300 times.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.346
Okay, listen, Mom, you know
that, uh, that real nice, uh,

19:39.379 --> 19:40.913
doormat I've got says
"Mi casa es su casa"?

19:40.947 --> 19:41.914
Yes.

19:41.948 --> 19:42.915
I'm gonna smother you with it

19:42.949 --> 19:45.252
if you don't get in the kitchen.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.487
Are-are you sure
about another date?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.422
Because, um, she's, um,

19:49.456 --> 19:50.990
she's not going
anywhere ever.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.693
She, uh, she lives with me.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.428
And there's no shame in that.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.364
Unless you share a bedroom.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.399
(laughs)
You don't share
a bedroom, do you?

19:59.432 --> 20:00.967
No. No.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.571
Except on Christmas Eve.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.407
She likes to see my face
when I wake up, so...

20:08.841 --> 20:11.278
Anyway, look, my-my...
my mother is crazy, okay?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.712
So I get it i-if you
don't want to...

20:17.617 --> 20:19.619
I can handle your mother.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.556
Call me.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.225
Yeah, I, uh, I will.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.764
That looked like a nice kiss.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.966
Good night, Mother.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.837
I'm taking Dr. Vega off
the boycott list right now.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.772
Hey.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.442
Where are my new sunglasses?

20:42.475 --> 20:45.878
The case and glasses
are completely gone.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.715
(cell phone dings)

20:51.083 --> 20:53.686
I told you I can handle
your mother.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.255
See you soon.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.459
They're not in the kitchen.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.594
Well.
(clears throat)

21:01.628 --> 21:03.663
I'm sure they're here somewhere.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.666
Keep looking.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.934
Try the roof.
