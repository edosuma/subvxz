30:39.527 --> 30:40.355

- Well my family has an
obligation too.

You don't think any of that
witch stuff is real, right?

32:07.339 --> 32:11.757
She's not like cursing
us or anything, is she?

32:11.791 --> 32:13.793

gave her.

32:17.521 --> 32:18.695

32:19.868 --> 32:20.697
- No.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.286
- You always been a pussy, Kib.

32:24.114 --> 32:26.496

stables quicker than I did.

32:27.773 --> 32:28.705
You're the pussy.

32:29.533 --> 32:30.500
- What'd you say?

32:30.534 --> 32:32.467
- Merv, sit down.

32:37.127 --> 32:38.404

coffee.

32:52.177 --> 32:53.247
Why don't you get dinner.

33:13.198 --> 33:14.578
- Call Jerry.

33:14.613 --> 33:16.235
-  Calling Jerry.

33:23.035 --> 33:23.863
- Shit.

33:23.898 --> 33:24.864
Jerry, it's me.

33:24.899 --> 33:26.073
Three men have taken me.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.011
Shit, no, no, no, no, no!

33:40.501 --> 33:42.951
- What are you doin' in
there, you sexy little bitch?

33:45.920 --> 33:47.301
Your ass is mine tomorrow.

33:51.098 --> 33:52.030
Or maybe tonight.

33:55.205 --> 33:56.034

33:57.311 --> 33:58.726

34:05.802 --> 34:09.840
Open the damn door!

34:09.875 --> 34:10.945
Damn it.

34:20.817 --> 34:21.680
What the hell are you doing?

34:21.714 --> 34:22.508
Open the door!

34:23.992 --> 34:24.821
What's wrong with you?

34:24.855 --> 34:25.649
What are you doing?

34:25.684 --> 34:26.478
- What do you mean?

34:27.306 --> 34:29.101
- You locked me out.

34:29.136 --> 34:30.275
- No, I didn't.

34:30.309 --> 34:32.104
I was drying my clothes.

34:32.139 --> 34:32.932
- Stupid liar.

34:32.967 --> 34:33.761
Grab my keys.

35:26.469 --> 35:27.263
Fuck!

36:46.790 --> 36:48.965
- Put your hands together.

36:53.141 --> 36:55.178
Dear Lord, thank you for this
day

36:56.248 --> 36:59.078
and delivering us a soul that we
can save.

37:00.356 --> 37:02.668
Your beautiful angel
will be coming home soon.

37:04.946 --> 37:08.916
Thank you for this food, and
let it nourish our bodies

37:08.950 --> 37:10.918
and give us strength and make us
strong.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.439
In your name we pray.

37:15.716 --> 37:16.544
Amen.

37:29.833 --> 37:31.870
-  And the
Lord wants a husband

37:31.904 --> 37:34.148
to have control in the home.

37:34.182 --> 37:36.461
He wants the ...

38:33.863 --> 38:35.589
That the husband needs to take--

38:35.623 --> 38:38.937
- What did I say about my
private time?

38:38.971 --> 38:40.594
What did I tell you?

38:42.250 --> 38:45.771
- Not to disturb you after
dinner.

38:45.806 --> 38:49.430
Well don't let it happen
again, or you'll be sorry.

38:49.465 --> 38:50.914
-  Outside of
marriage,

38:50.949 --> 38:53.883
but rather in the holy
matrimonial bed,

38:53.917 --> 38:57.749
where Jesus is present and
watching

38:57.783 --> 38:59.371
what is going on.
- Shit!

38:59.406 --> 39:00.476
Get the hell in here!

39:05.895 --> 39:07.414
- Oh, hell nah!

39:08.311 --> 39:09.933
- That wasn't there a minute
ago.

39:09.968 --> 39:11.107
Did you do this?

39:11.141 --> 39:12.488
- No, Pa.

39:12.522 --> 39:13.454
It's the curse!

39:13.489 --> 39:15.042
- It ain't no damn curse!

39:15.076 --> 39:16.837
If you knew how to dig a hole,

39:16.871 --> 39:17.907
this wouldn't have happened!

39:17.941 --> 39:19.702
Now get that mess cleaned up!

39:22.118 --> 39:23.740
- You heard Pa.

39:23.775 --> 39:26.018
Clean it up.

39:29.090 --> 39:29.884
- I knew it.

39:31.092 --> 39:32.162
We caught us a witch.

39:48.006 --> 39:50.077
-  Check her ropes.

39:52.044 --> 39:52.838
- They're tight.

39:54.012 --> 39:55.738
- How did you do it?

39:55.772 --> 39:57.084
- Do what?

39:57.118 --> 39:59.051
- Don't play dumb, girl!

39:59.086 --> 40:00.328
The bones!

40:05.610 --> 40:06.990
Don't lie to me.

40:07.888 --> 40:10.166
- Looks like she needs to
learn about repentance, Pa.

40:17.449 --> 40:18.692
- What the hell is that?

40:18.726 --> 40:23.248
-  I don't know.

40:58.110 --> 40:59.387
- Let's get to the house.

41:13.056 --> 41:15.196
-  We've got
beautiful sunny skies

41:15.231 --> 41:17.233
and mild fall ...

41:17.267 --> 41:19.925
That are just perfect for
this time of the year.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.375
There's no rain in the forecast,

41:21.409 --> 41:24.930
which is perfect for us
and the festival tonight.

41:24.965 --> 41:28.278
We're super excited to
have this beautiful weather

41:28.313 --> 41:31.247
after so mach rain during the
summer.

41:31.281 --> 41:33.387
- Today's high temperature ...
- James, it's me!

41:33.421 --> 41:35.009
Three men have taken me--

41:35.941 --> 41:37.080
-  Today's
temperatures

41:37.115 --> 41:38.772
are not going to fluctuate much.

41:38.806 --> 41:41.775
It's going to be 78 degrees in
Asheboro.

41:41.809 --> 41:42.603
-  Hey, this is
Tamara.

41:42.638 --> 41:44.053
You know what to do.

41:44.087 --> 41:46.296
-  And 80 down in
Troy.

41:47.332 --> 41:48.298
Tonight should be

41:48.333 --> 41:49.541
absolutely perfect.
- Hey, this is Tamara.

41:49.576 --> 41:50.680
You know what to do.

41:55.202 --> 41:57.204
-  We look
forward to a weekend

41:57.238 --> 41:59.482
of fine, beautiful weather.

42:31.445 --> 42:32.273
- Shh.

42:33.827 --> 42:35.000
I ain't gonna hurt you.

42:35.898 --> 42:37.244
I just came to talk to you.

42:40.799 --> 42:43.043
If I move my hand, you
promise not to scream?

42:51.051 --> 42:53.156
I grew up knowing the Lord is my
shepherd.

42:56.125 --> 42:57.954
I ain't never met a witch
before.

43:00.992 --> 43:03.063
Pa and Merv have made me do some
things,

43:05.548 --> 43:08.240
but only so they could be
saved from their wickedness.

43:09.483 --> 43:10.311
- Who?

43:12.003 --> 43:14.005
- All the other girls we sent to
heaven.

43:16.766 --> 43:21.771
Pa says if we sacrifice
them, they can all be saved.

43:24.394 --> 43:25.844
- Do you really believe that?

43:28.985 --> 43:33.438
- Pa says the Bible teaches us
how to live while we're here.

43:34.922 --> 43:39.720
We have to give them our
seed so they can go to heaven

43:39.755 --> 43:41.688
so they can make angel babies in
heaven.

43:42.999 --> 43:46.382
And that makes good people down
here.

43:46.416 --> 43:47.210
You see?

43:50.800 --> 43:55.805
But if you're a witch and we
give your soul to the Devil,

43:57.704 --> 43:59.291
you won't make angel babies.

44:00.983 --> 44:02.260
You'll make devil babies.

44:05.608 --> 44:06.920
So I don't know what to do.

44:08.956 --> 44:09.785
- Kib.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.167
You can't hurt any more girls.

44:13.202 --> 44:14.341
You can't hurt me.

44:15.722 --> 44:19.864
The Lord wants you to be
happy and treat people kindly.

44:19.898 --> 44:22.349
He doesn't want you to kill
them.

44:22.383 --> 44:24.627
Those girls were just girls.

44:24.662 --> 44:25.870
They weren't angels.

44:27.492 --> 44:29.425
So just please let me go.

44:33.463 --> 44:34.637
- So you ain't a witch?

44:35.603 --> 44:36.432
- No.

44:37.847 --> 44:39.193
- They you'll go the heaven!

44:40.885 --> 44:42.438
That's great.

44:43.301 --> 44:44.751
Thank you.

44:44.785 --> 44:47.029
I knew you were an angel.

44:47.063 --> 44:48.962
You sure are a pretty thing.

44:49.963 --> 44:51.723
- Kib, please, no, no, no!

44:51.758 --> 44:52.966
Kib, come back!

44:54.761 --> 44:55.623
Kib!

44:58.281 --> 44:59.110
Shit!

46:27.301 --> 46:28.130
- Pa!

46:29.200 --> 46:30.373
Pa, you all right?

46:30.408 --> 46:31.202
Pa?

46:38.140 --> 46:39.037
- She's the Devil.

46:42.661 --> 46:44.732
That girl is the Devil.

46:51.739 --> 46:53.396
- What is this shit?

46:54.535 --> 46:55.951
- These are our angels, Pa.

46:58.954 --> 47:02.716
- The Devil has sent those
girls back to haunt us.

48:25.833 --> 48:30.838
- You came into this world
wicked, and you never changed.

48:33.082 --> 48:35.809
The Devil has consumed you.

48:37.638 --> 48:40.952
It is time to cleanse your body
and soul.

48:40.987 --> 48:44.197
Do you accept God in your heart?

48:57.348 --> 49:01.041
Do you accept God in your heart?

49:12.984 --> 49:15.849
Girl, this is the last
time I try to save you.

49:16.919 --> 49:19.818
Do you accept God in your heart?

49:22.683 --> 49:23.788
- Okay, okay!

49:24.720 --> 49:26.791
I accept God in my heart!

49:29.863 --> 49:31.347
- That's my angel.

49:57.235 --> 49:58.133
Burn those.

49:59.134 --> 50:00.273
Go finish the hole.

50:05.278 --> 50:06.106
- I can't.

50:07.521 --> 50:08.350
- What'd you say?

50:10.766 --> 50:11.974
- She's not an angel.

50:14.149 --> 50:15.322
She won't go to heaven.

50:16.875 --> 50:17.945
- You'd rather have the Devil

50:17.980 --> 50:20.672

hell?

50:49.977 --> 50:52.670
I'm looking for three girls
that were here last night.

50:53.533 --> 50:54.499
One in particular.

50:56.881 --> 50:59.953
- Yeah, I remember her, and her
friends.

50:59.987 --> 51:01.196
They were pretty wild.

51:01.230 --> 51:03.232
They had this whole
place crawlin' for 'em.

51:03.267 --> 51:05.993
Even had a couple fellas
buy 'em some drinks.

51:06.028 --> 51:07.340
- You happen to know what
these guys look like?

51:07.374 --> 51:08.893
- Kinda rough lookin'.

51:08.927 --> 51:10.412
Beards.

51:10.446 --> 51:12.310
One of 'em had glasses.

51:12.345 --> 51:13.415
Maybe mid-20s.

51:14.692 --> 51:17.453
- So you didn't catch their
name or where they were going?

51:17.488 --> 51:20.111
- No, sorry.

51:20.146 --> 51:21.492
- You got security cameras.

51:21.526 --> 51:23.666
Is it possible to get
ahold of these tapes?

51:24.805 --> 51:26.048
- Yeah, we got the cameras,

51:26.083 --> 51:28.844
but to be honest with
you, we don't run tapes.

51:31.157 --> 51:33.883
- They wouldn't open
or anything like that?

51:33.918 --> 51:35.299
- No, they paid in cash.

51:37.370 --> 51:38.819
- Okay, well ...

51:38.854 --> 51:40.718
here's my card.

You go ahead a give me a call
if you hear or see anything.

51:44.239 --> 51:45.309
- Yeah, absolutely.

51:45.343 --> 51:46.137
Will do.

52:14.510 --> 52:17.341
- Dear God, thank you for the
day.

52:19.550 --> 52:21.621
I was weak and you gave me
strength.

52:23.623 --> 52:24.934
I see what faith is now.

52:26.384 --> 52:29.007
Pa always tells me I need
to have more faith in you,

52:30.043 --> 52:31.078

I'm saved.

54:19.739 --> 54:20.774
- But I thought you only could
be saved

54:20.809 --> 54:22.707
if you were sacrificed.

54:22.742 --> 54:25.400
If you're an angle, wouldn't
you want to be in heaven?

54:27.402 --> 54:29.231

54:29.266 --> 54:30.301
I'm the Lord's worker.

54:31.751 --> 54:34.443
- Well you see, Kib, an
angel is the Lord's worker,

54:34.478 --> 54:36.549
so, if you were an angel,

54:36.583 --> 54:38.896
you'd be in heaven, wouldn't you
be?

54:40.277 --> 54:42.175
But you're here on earth,

54:42.209 --> 54:44.867
so therefore you're working for
my leader.

54:44.902 --> 54:46.490

54:56.293 --> 54:57.259
Look.

54:57.294 --> 54:59.675
You already dug yourself a hole.

Your name is written in his

1:04:24.757 --> 1:04:26.828
made it a lot easier on
ourselves.

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:29.141
- But the justice system kinda
sucks.

1:04:29.175 --> 1:04:32.316
- And more importantly,
where's the fun in that.

1:04:33.317 --> 1:04:34.698
- Here's the deal.

1:04:34.732 --> 1:04:36.044
You fell into our little trap,

1:04:36.079 --> 1:04:38.598

girls fell into yours.

1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:42.948

1:04:42.982 --> 1:04:44.570
Should we fill them in?

1:04:44.604 --> 1:04:45.985

wake up in a place unexpected?

1:04:51.232 --> 1:04:52.129
- Is it terrifying?

1:04:54.511 --> 1:04:55.443
- Fuck you!

1:04:56.685 --> 1:04:57.617

1:05:41.316 --> 1:05:42.145
Oh, look.

1:05:43.525 --> 1:05:44.319
It is.

1:05:53.259 --> 1:05:54.260
You know ...

1:05:55.710 --> 1:05:56.849
it's a shame.

1:05:58.333 --> 1:06:00.266
If you weren't such a sick fuck,

1:06:00.301 --> 1:06:02.096
we'd probably sleep with you.

1:06:08.516 --> 1:06:11.070
Unfortunately, you won't be
needing this where you're going.

game called 16 Angels.

1:06:47.451 --> 1:06:49.350
Why 16 Angels, you ask?

1:06:50.661 --> 1:06:53.285
Because that's the number
of girls you've taken,

1:06:53.319 --> 1:06:56.943
tortured, raped, and murdered!

1:06:56.978 --> 1:06:58.324
- It's a simple game, really.

1:06:58.359 --> 1:06:59.705
You get one second to get away

1:06:59.739 --> 1:07:01.465
for every angel that you've
killed.

1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:04.779

brains out.

- We'll see about that.

1:07:31.564 --> 1:07:32.358
