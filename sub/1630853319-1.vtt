Female singer:
J“ my man's a taxi driver

00:15.057 --> 00:18.852
j“ my man's a taxi driver

00:19.186 --> 00:22.064
j“ I'd like to take a ride with you

00:23.065 --> 00:25.901

j“ my man's a taxi driver j“

01:35.554 --> 01:37.806
Narrator:
Every major international city

01:37.889 --> 01:42.352
has that most popular
means of transport, the taxi.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.813
That unique brand of conveyance

01:44.896 --> 01:47.983
which combines
efficiency with individuality.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.737
Perhaps most popular
for the personal service it provides.

01:55.741 --> 01:59.578
Enthusiastic, hard-working,
with never a moment's rest,

01:59.661 --> 02:02.581
probably the taxi driver's
most lovable attribute

02:02.664 --> 02:06.460
is the warm welcome
he is always eager to extend

02:06.501 --> 02:08.629
to foreign visitors.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.465
The moment you hail a taxi,

02:11.673 --> 02:15.135
you can be sure
of being greeted by a friendly smile,

02:15.218 --> 02:17.095
a concern for your well-being,

02:17.179 --> 02:21.308
and someone at the wheel
always ready to lend a helping hand.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.079
There are, at present,
literally millions of taxis

02:42.162 --> 02:45.415
operating throughout the world
on a 24-hour basis,

02:47.501 --> 02:51.421
ensuring that at any time,
day or night, within seconds,

02:51.505 --> 02:55.801
you can be speeding happily away
to the destination of your choice.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.473
Renowned for their
total lack of prejudice,

03:01.556 --> 03:03.475
a taxi will stop for anybody,

03:03.558 --> 03:06.812
irrespective of colour,
class, or creed.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.528
Adored by the public

03:14.611 --> 03:17.698
for their whimsical charm
and delightful disposition,

03:17.781 --> 03:20.742
perhaps, more than any other form
of public transport,

03:20.826 --> 03:25.580
the taxi driver holds a unique place
in the hearts of the people.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.251
Not least his fellow road users,
who appreciate to the full

03:29.418 --> 03:31.461
that quiet, courteous Patience,

03:31.545 --> 03:33.755
that affable, friendly manner,

03:33.880 --> 03:36.508
that consideration
for his fellow motorists,

03:36.675 --> 03:38.885
with whom he is
always ready to exchange

03:38.969 --> 03:42.180
a friendly wave
and some merry little quip.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.769
But, possibly more than
anything else to his credit,

03:47.853 --> 03:51.606
the taxi driver bears the distinction
of being a driver of knowledge,

03:51.773 --> 03:53.900
experience and efficiency,

03:53.984 --> 03:55.986
reassuring all who drive with him

03:56.153 --> 03:59.489
that the taxi is not only
the safest vehicle on the road,

03:59.614 --> 04:01.074
but holds the proud record

04:01.199 --> 04:04.369
for being involved in the
least number of accidents.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.796
Without a doubt, we, the public,

04:14.921 --> 04:18.175
owe much to these
gallant knights of the road,

04:18.300 --> 04:20.635
of whom it can truly be said,

04:20.802 --> 04:23.221
"everything we feel for them,

04:23.680 --> 04:25.932
"the y feel for us."

04:43.492 --> 04:46.369
That'll be seventy-five, guv.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.496
Thank you.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.373
Thank you.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.668
Thank you very much.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.670
Well, you try smiling

04:55.754 --> 04:58.357
when you've been lumbered with
a miserable, tight-fisted git like him,

04:58.381 --> 05:00.151
after you've fought through
all the bleedin' traffic

05:00.175 --> 05:03.512
and had him moanin' on at you,
like it was all your fault.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.809
Sorry about that.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.436
Been a bit of a bad day,
know what I mean?

05:11.561 --> 05:13.396
By the way, my name's Joe.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.775
Well, with a name like that, I had to
go in the cabbing business, didn't I?

05:16.900 --> 05:19.694
Been at it a year or so now.
Got me own cab.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.823
Well, almost.
Soon as I've finished paying for it.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.616
Yeah, it's not such a bad job, really.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.536
Hard work, but then
so's anything these days.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.995
Not that I mind.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.873
Got me health and strength,
know what I mean?

05:31.957 --> 05:34.459
Mind you, I'll be a lot happier
when I get me own place.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.670
Trouble is, you see,
I live at home.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.172
You need a bit of peace and quiet
after doing this job.

05:39.256 --> 05:42.676
And iivin' at home?
No joke, I can tell ya.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.886
Oh, yeah, makes
a great start to the day.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.974
Joe: Oh, come on, mum,
I'm late as it is.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.977
Well, it's your own fault.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.729
Comin' in here last night,
pissed as a newt,

05:54.855 --> 05:57.774
crashin' about all over the place
and wakin' me up.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.569
Lay off, ma, will ya?
Do us a favour.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.697
You're gettin' more like your father
every day, you are.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.908
And you're gonna end up like him,
Mark my words.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.660
And where were you last night?

06:08.743 --> 06:11.580
Out screwin' some poor,
innocent little girl, I suppose.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.875
- Just like your father.
- Don't make me laugh.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.335
You hardly knew him.
You only met him once.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.672
Don't talk like that
in front of the baby.

06:20.881 --> 06:25.093
You woke her up and all, didn't he,
my dear little pet?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.053
Have more consideration.

06:27.178 --> 06:30.724
Anyway, it was twice I met him.
Twice.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.559
Gimme 'em!

06:32.767 --> 06:36.021
Mummy'll give you somethin'
nicer than that to play with,

06:36.104 --> 06:38.064
there's a good little girl.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.276
Well, are you gonna sit
staring at that all day,

06:41.359 --> 06:42.569
or are you gonna eat it?

06:42.652 --> 06:45.363
I don't feel like eating. Look,
just give me a cup of tea, will ya?

06:45.447 --> 06:48.366
Mrs north: Oh, I don't know
why I bother, I really don't.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.953
I mean, food is wasted
just as though it cost nothing.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.955
Joe: All right, all right!
Something's burning.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.124
Porridge, by the smell.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.045
Oh, it's all right,
just at the bottom.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.963
The top's all right.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.011
- Don't like porridge!
- Yes, you do. It's lovely.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.722
It's horrid! Horrid! Horrid!

07:10.805 --> 07:12.265
- Shut up!
- Mrs north: Oh!

07:12.390 --> 07:15.018
Mrs north: Now look what you've done.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.354
You know it makes her cry.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.815
All right, I give up. That's it.
Bloody hell. I'm late as it is.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.194
- Look, where's me fares book?
- Oh, in the cupboard.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.033
Oh, my god!

07:30.200 --> 07:32.285
That little tyke's been thievin' again,
ain't he?

07:32.369 --> 07:36.122
Where is he? Peter!
Come in here! Peter!

07:36.206 --> 07:38.833
And he's like his father and all.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.020
Wind up in the same cell with him,
I shouldn't wonder,

07:41.044 --> 07:43.046
the way he's carryin' on.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.089
Peter!

07:44.214 --> 07:46.424
How am I supposed to get to sleep
with all this racket?

07:46.549 --> 07:48.301
Yeah? So?
Where's the fire, then?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.679
Joe: Over here. Come here.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.098
Look, what have you got to say about
all this lot, then?

07:53.181 --> 07:56.309
Good gear, innit?
I mean, it's not rubbish, is it?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.895
Here, you said
you got a properjob.

07:59.020 --> 07:59.854
Vveh, I have.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.815
I mean, I'm doin' it
proper now, aren't I?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.817
Been working very hard
at it and all.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.236
I've got a sharp little
organisation together.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.130
You're gonna get us all into trouble
one of these days.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.514
I mean, anyone could just walk in.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.783
Yeah, and all that lot iyin' there.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.536
Not to mention
twenty cartons of hairspray

08:14.619 --> 08:15.996
I found hidden under me bed.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.127
Fell off the back of a lorry,
didn't they, mum?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.476
You're gonna end up in the Nick
with ten years ahead of you.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.045
Peter's goin' in the Nick!
Peter's goin' in the Nick!

08:24.212 --> 08:25.839
Why can't you get
an honest job for once?

08:26.089 --> 08:28.717
What? Like driving a cab?
Leave off.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.778
Anyway, that's no more than
bleedin' highway robbery,

08:30.802 --> 08:32.613
so what are you doin'
tellin' me to go straight?

08:32.637 --> 08:34.597
Joe: Oh, choice. I like that.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.853
Just don't ask me
to bail you out, that's all.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.523
It's your funeral.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.540
What'd I tell ya, eh?
It's always like that.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.293
Makes it a pleasure
goin' to work of a mornin'.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.260
I tell you what'd cheer me up,
be to pick up a nice bit of crumpet.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.345
Very handy for introductions,
this motor.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.610
Female singer:
J“ a man about town like you

09:29.194 --> 09:32.113
j“ you have better things to do

09:32.989 --> 09:34.908
j“ but spendin' the time

09:34.991 --> 09:38.119
j“ I'll see that it's worth your while

09:38.203 --> 09:40.246
j“ oh, baby

09:40.330 --> 09:44.209
j“ I know you've been runnin' free

09:44.334 --> 09:46.836
j“ I think you'd have fun with me

09:46.920 --> 09:48.963
j“ forget the rest

09:49.047 --> 09:53.259
j“ I'd like to test your drivin' style

09:53.301 --> 09:54.969
j“ won't you be my

09:55.053 --> 09:58.807
j“ cruisin' Casanova?

09:59.015 --> 10:03.019
J“ click your fingers
and I'll be over there

10:03.353 --> 10:05.063
j“ smoothin' your hair

10:05.188 --> 10:08.399
j“ soothin' your cares away

10:08.483 --> 10:13.613
j“ there's no refusin' Casanova

10:13.780 --> 10:17.951
j“ stop the clock and workin' overtime

10:18.118 --> 10:21.663
j“ cruisin' Casanova, be mine

10:21.788 --> 10:25.083
j“ my man's a taxi driver... j“

10:30.588 --> 10:33.383
- Where to, darling?
- Lambeth bridge, please.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.301
Right you are, then.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.024
Nice morning, innit?
You off to work, then?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.569
Yeah, I thought so.
I can usually tell.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.488
Well, being in this job, you have to
be a bit of a psychologist.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.657
What do you do for a living, eh?
No, don't tell me.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.117
Let me guess.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.703
I'd say you're a secretary, right?

11:01.828 --> 11:05.165
Personal secretary
to some oil magnate, eh?

11:05.290 --> 11:07.000
Really high-powered.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.002
Don't let appearances fool ya.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.504
Be a right little raver, this one,
when it gets going.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.464
Got a lovely little body on her, too.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.425
No mistake.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.510
Looks a bit miserable, though.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.804
I know what she needs, right?

11:19.888 --> 11:21.723
That's another thing I can tell.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.643
Whether a bird's had a good
seein' to, or not, the night before.

11:25.727 --> 11:29.522
I reckon that one's had a right
thin time of it lately, don't you?

11:29.814 --> 11:33.193
Born in London, were ya?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.903
I'd say,
judging from your accent,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.405
that you're from
somewhere up north, right?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.324
Yes, I can usually tell.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.744
Somewhere like, er...
Liverpool, maybe?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.246
Yeah. Liverpool, I'd say.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.415
She's weakening.
What'd I tell you, eh?

11:47.498 --> 11:51.669
Oh, yes, definitely softening up.
Stands out a mile.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.463
Which side of the bridge, love?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.632
- The middle.
- The middle?

11:55.757 --> 11:57.592
Right, then. Middle it is.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.565
That'll be, um... here, hang on!

12:12.690 --> 12:16.486
Hey! Hang on a minute, darling.
What about my fare?

12:27.372 --> 12:30.041
Go away and leave me alone!
Please. Just leave me alone.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.126
But I never laid a finger on ya.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.312
Look_.
What's the matter with you?

12:33.336 --> 12:35.672
Jesus Christ,
I only want me bleedin' fare.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.524
Look, if you haven't got it,
there's no need to panic.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.592
I mean it.
Don't come any closer.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.011
All right. All right.
I'm going. I'm going.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.721
You don't care, do you?

12:43.805 --> 12:45.431
- Nobody cares.
- Eh?

12:45.515 --> 12:47.308
No-one will even notice I'm dead.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.519
All right, then,
if that's the way it is,

12:49.602 --> 12:50.645
I'll jump now.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.689
- Oh, my god!
- Don't try and stop me.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.899
It's too late.
My mind's made up.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.110
No. Wait. Don't do it!

12:57.193 --> 13:01.864
The pain, the suffering, will only end
when the icy waters close over me,

13:01.990 --> 13:03.241
carrying me away into oblivion.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.411
- Funny bird.
- The dreamless sleep of eternity.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.972
Darlin', why don't you
tell me about it?

13:07.996 --> 13:09.539
I mean, I don't
pretend to understand.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.915
I've only just met you, haventl?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.184
But you know
what they say, right?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.918
"A trouble shared
is a trouble halved."

13:14.002 --> 13:16.838
And all can say is, well,
it seems to me a terrible waste,

13:16.963 --> 13:19.340
beautiful girl like you
tryin' to do away with herself.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.550
What do you say, eh?

13:20.758 --> 13:22.236
I mean, nothing's
ever that bad, really.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.761
Not when you come down to it.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.722
It's too late for talking now.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.765
Oh, please, darlin'. Try, eh?

13:27.849 --> 13:29.684
I'm all alone in the world.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.395
No-one loves me. No-one cares.

13:32.478 --> 13:36.274
You don't know what it's like
to be left alone, unloved, unwanted.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.109
Hold on. I don't believe it.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.570
Beautiful girl like you
and no-one wants to know?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.488
Listen, [could love ya.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.657
I mean, the first time I saw ya,
I said to meself,

13:44.699 --> 13:46.492
"now there's a girl
I could really love."

13:46.576 --> 13:48.036
There was a man.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.412
Once.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.039
I thought he loved me.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.833
- Oh, Ronald, Ronald!
- Watch yourself, you'll fall!

13:53.916 --> 13:55.043
He's never coming back.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.670
I'll never see him again.
Never! I want to die.

13:57.754 --> 14:01.341
I can't face life without him.
Oh, Ronald, Ronald!

14:04.886 --> 14:06.971
I can't even kill myself properly.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.639
I'm a failure at everything.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.142
No, you just need
cheerin' up, that's all.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.311
Look, you've had
a nasty shock, right?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.730
Why don't I take you home, eh?
Where do you live?

14:16.397 --> 14:18.649
Do you really think
I'll ever be able to forget Ronald?

14:18.733 --> 14:20.985
'Course you will.
With a bit of help.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.362
I need love, you see.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.739
That's what I need,
lots of loving.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.532
Well, er...

14:26.616 --> 14:28.159
I did just save her life, didn't I?

14:28.242 --> 14:30.745
I mean, the way I look at it,
it's an offer I can't refuse.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.456
And strong arms.
Strong arms to hold me.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.876
Hold ya? It's like trying to
undress a bloody octopus.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.087
I don't want you
to think I'm promiscuous,

14:39.170 --> 14:40.647
just because you caught me
at a weak moment.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.340
Oh, I don't. I don't.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.092
Look, just lift up a bit, will ya?

14:44.175 --> 14:46.636
It's just that without Ronald,
I feel so helpless.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.405
Oh, I don't know,
you seem to be doing all right.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.390
I wish he was here right now,
so he could see.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.933
Oh, I don't!

14:54.060 --> 14:55.478
Man: Linda!

14:55.561 --> 14:57.605
- It's Ronald.
- Ronald?

15:01.359 --> 15:03.486
- Oh!
- You got it all wrong, mate.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.113
It's not like that at all.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.657
I've just brought her back in my cab,
you see.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.659
And you're just collecting the fare,
that right?

15:09.700 --> 15:11.119
Yeah. No!

15:11.202 --> 15:14.038
You mustn't...
Mustn't get it wrong. Um...

15:14.288 --> 15:16.249
I didn't dare leave her.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.459
She was gonna do herself in.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.753
Throw herself off lambeth bridge.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.338
Well, that makes a change.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.758
Let's see, what's the score now?
Westminster twice,

15:25.842 --> 15:28.010
blackfriars, London bridge,
tower bridge,

15:28.094 --> 15:29.446
and that's only
in the last few months.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.265
Well, how was I supposed to know?
I mean, she was in a terrible state.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.100
- Said you'd left her.
- And you did.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.828
You just walked out
without saying goodbye,

15:35.852 --> 15:36.853
and you slammed the door.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.188
- Cover yourself up, will you?
- That's typical, that is.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.149
Most of the time
you want me to uncover myself.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.668
That's different.
That's when I'm with you.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.652
Well, you're with me now,
so what's different?

15:44.777 --> 15:46.737
Admit it, you only
want me for my body.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.139
Oh, Linda, don't be so ridiculous.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.115
- I'm not being...
- Er... excuse me...

15:49.198 --> 15:50.426
You think you can
treat me how you like,

15:50.450 --> 15:51.659
as if I've got no feelings.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.871
- Now, you know that's not true.
- Oh, calling me a liar, are you, now?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.474
Not content with only wanting me
for my body, I'm a liar as well!

15:57.498 --> 15:59.542
- Ronald: I didn't say that!
- Um... excuse me...

15:59.667 --> 16:02.420
I knew it. I just knew it.
You don't love me any more.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.754
Of course I do!

16:03.838 --> 16:05.965
You wouldn't say
such things if you did.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.276
Look, I don't want
to interrupt anything...

16:07.300 --> 16:10.154
Look, if I didn't love you, how the hell
could I have put up with you for so long?

16:10.178 --> 16:11.989
- I said, I don't want to interrupt...
- Just mind your own business.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.198
Keep your nose out of this, mate.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.099
I've got to go to work
sometimes, you know,

16:15.183 --> 16:18.227
without you thinking I'm leaving you
and threatening to commit suicide.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.396
You drive me to it. You're so...

16:20.480 --> 16:22.356
You're so cruel to me!
Thank you.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.667
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't be so stupid.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.318
You're sick, that's your trouble.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.487
Linda: Oh, yes,
that's always your attitude.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.698
You never think.
And you still haven't remembered.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.242
Ronald: Remembered what,
for heaven's sake?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.702
Linda: It's my birthday!

16:34.827 --> 16:36.263
Ronald: So what's important
about a birthday?

16:36.287 --> 16:38.056
- Linda: It's very important...
- Ronald: You have one every year.

16:38.080 --> 16:43.127
- Come on, you can't have more than one.
- Linda: It's very important to have a birthday!

16:52.261 --> 16:55.723
It's gonna be one of those days.
I just know it.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.728
Peter: I'd like to take her out
and push her under a bus.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.207
Mrs north: Don't you talk about
your little sister like that.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.732
I won't have it!

17:04.815 --> 17:07.401
Sister? She's not even human.

17:07.485 --> 17:11.030
Look at that lot! A whole
bleedin' ton of soap powder ruined.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.949
Do you know how much money
she's lost me?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.536
And when I'd done a deal on it.
Knocked myself out to set it up.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.680
Mrs north: Well, no-one asked you
to bring it in here, did they?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.248
Clutterin' up my kitchen.

17:20.331 --> 17:23.000
Well, I want it out.
Just get rid of it.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.877
- Do you hear me?
- Oh, yeah?

17:24.961 --> 17:26.379
Now, what am I supposed to say?

17:26.462 --> 17:28.965
Like, er...
"Listen, mate, about that soap powder,

17:29.048 --> 17:32.385
"I did have it, see, but it
sort of vanished. Sorry about that."

17:32.510 --> 17:35.972
Or how about, "my little sister
decided to decorate the house with it."

17:36.055 --> 17:38.766
Oh, they're gonna love that,
after they've picked themselves up

17:38.849 --> 17:40.560
off the bloody floor laughing,
of course.

17:40.643 --> 17:43.980
Joe, Joe, just tell him, will you?
Just tell him to get rid of it.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.148
No. No. I... I've had
as much as I can take.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.126
I wash my hands of
the whole bleedin' lot of you.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.152
That's it, as far as I'm concerned.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.757
Mrs north: Why don't you get rid of
the stuff you've already got

17:53.781 --> 17:55.408
before you bring more in?

17:55.491 --> 17:58.744
It's getting so that I can't even
move around me own house.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.580
What's all that gear
doin' in my bedroom?

18:00.621 --> 18:02.766
Peter: I'll wring her bloody little neck,
so help me, I will.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.958
Joe: Peter!

18:04.041 --> 18:06.061
Peter: Little monster ought to
have been put down at birth.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.211
What?

18:07.295 --> 18:08.421
- Peter!
- Peter: What?

18:08.504 --> 18:11.299
I want to know what all that...

18:11.382 --> 18:13.926
Oh, never mind. Forget it.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.929
And where do you think
you're going, sunny Jim?

18:17.013 --> 18:19.932
I've got a
nice little job for you first.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.353
- Dump it.
- Peter: Oh, ma, where?

18:24.437 --> 18:27.148
Mrs north:
That is your problem, not mine.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.401
And mind you
bring that bucket back.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.453
Where do you think
you're going with that?

18:40.536 --> 18:41.829
I told you, I'm leaving.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.291
Oh, I see. Just walkin' out
and ieavin' me to cope?

18:45.416 --> 18:48.210
A fine son you turned out to be.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.380
Just like your father,
whoever he was. Here!

18:51.464 --> 18:54.216
What am I supposed to tell Carol
when she comes?

18:54.258 --> 18:56.218
Well, you can tell her to...

18:56.302 --> 18:58.429
- Hello, love.
- Hello, love.

18:58.512 --> 19:02.683
Carol, me steady. Bit of a drag.
Got wedding bells in her ears.

19:02.767 --> 19:06.103
- What you doin' with that, then?
- He's clearin' off.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.815
Walkin' out on his responsibilities,
that's what he's doin'.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.653
Oh, no! No, I'm sure Joe wouldn't do
a thing like that without telling me.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.196
- Would you, Joe?
- Yes, I would.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.783
I've had enough. I'm clearin' out.
I've had enough.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.034
Ooh!

19:20.117 --> 19:23.287
Well, I expect
I'll see you later, then?

19:23.371 --> 19:25.539
Joeljoe!

19:25.623 --> 19:28.459
Joe north!
You come here. Come here.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.170
Do I comprehend
the situation correctly?

19:31.295 --> 19:33.547
- Are you ieavin' home?
- Dead right.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.717
Without a word to me
or even a by-your-leave?

19:36.801 --> 19:38.302
It's got nothing to do with you.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.307
What do you mean
it's got nothing to do with me?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.014
I happen to be your fiancée,

19:42.139 --> 19:44.600
and fiancées have a right
to know these things.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.269
- So where are you going?
- I don't know.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.564
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Well, I just told you, I don't know.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.793
You can't just leave home
and not know where you're going.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.861
As soon as I find somewhere,
I'll get in touch, all right?

19:55.945 --> 19:58.114
Well, when's that, then?

19:58.197 --> 20:01.075
How should I know? Tonight, tomorrow,
as soon as I'm settled in.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.261
Well, does that mean you're not
gonna take me out tonight?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.413
How can I?
I don't know where I'll be.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.915
- Gone with the wind.
- W hat?

20:07.998 --> 20:11.210
That's what you were supposed
to take me to, gone with the wind.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.504
Oh, come on, now.
You must have seen it ten times.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.714
Eleven.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.150
What with that and lady and the tramp
every year at Christmas,

20:17.174 --> 20:18.734
it's enough to
drive anyone up the wall.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.512
Well, you don't have to come.
I mean, nobody's forcing you to.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.806
I mean, you don't have to care
if I'm on my own,

20:23.889 --> 20:26.142
probably being molested
in the back row.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.352
Oh, come on.
Who's gonna molest you?

20:28.477 --> 20:30.688
Lots of people, if! Let 'em.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.523
Anyway, you always do.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.292
Yeah, well, I've gotta find
something to do, haven't I?

20:34.316 --> 20:35.585
Gone with the wind,
it's a long film.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.862
Well, if you won't
take me to the pictures,

20:38.028 --> 20:40.298
why can't I come with you
and help you find somewhere to stay?

20:40.322 --> 20:43.117
Carol, I'll be all right.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.953
Supposing you're movin' in
with another woman?

20:46.036 --> 20:47.872
Oh, leave off, Carol.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.498
Well, how am I supposed to know?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.709
Look, I'll ring you, all right?

20:51.792 --> 20:54.503
You see, if you would have told me
you were ieavin' home,

20:54.670 --> 20:56.046
I could have done the same,

20:56.130 --> 20:57.899
and then we could have
moved in together, and...

20:57.923 --> 21:00.593
And got married
before I originally planned.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.470
Yeah. Well, er... I'll ring you.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.513
See, if you wouldn't mind
hangin' about for a bit,

21:04.555 --> 21:06.640
I could belt home
and start packing straight away.

21:06.724 --> 21:07.892
Ah, no! Look, um...

21:07.975 --> 21:10.728
Twenty minutes, fifteen at the outside
if you took me by cab.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.856
Carol, I haven't got time
for all this.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.111
What is the matter?

21:19.195 --> 21:20.988
Do you not want
to live with me anymore?

21:21.071 --> 21:23.282
'Course I do.
It's nothing to do with that.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.868
Well, you wouldn't think so,
the way you go on about it.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.305
You know, you'll have to get
used to it once we're married.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.580
Look, what's up with you?

21:29.663 --> 21:31.081
Don't you trust me or something?

21:31.165 --> 21:32.958
Quite frankly, no.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.126
Charmin'.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.004
Well, it's just that I don't like
to think of you being unfaithful.

21:37.087 --> 21:41.258
Especially as I spent all my savings
last week buying my engagement ring.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.969
- Have I ever been unfaithful to you?
- No.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.263
Have you ever caught me
with another woman?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.767
Have you ever caught me,
when I've been out with you,

21:49.850 --> 21:52.353
even looking at another woman?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.271
- No.
- Well, there you are, then.

21:54.355 --> 21:57.024
You've got nothing to worry about,
have you?

21:57.525 --> 21:59.819
That is besides the point.

21:59.902 --> 22:04.615
Remember, a penny saved
is a penny not spent.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.700
What are you goin' on about?

22:06.867 --> 22:10.287
Do not put
all your balls in one basket.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.498
That is what I'm trying to say.

22:12.540 --> 22:17.169
You see, if I caught you reclining
in the embrace of another woman,

22:17.419 --> 22:19.380
do you know what I would do?

22:19.463 --> 22:21.173
I would chop it off!

22:22.758 --> 22:23.968
Look, you can trust me.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.513
As soon as I find somewhere,
I'll ring you, all right?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.640
But, I thought I was
coming with you.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.393
- What?
- Well, that's what we agreed.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.478
- Yeah. Well, look, um... you go home...
- Yeah.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.063
- And pack your things.
- Yeah.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.108
- And then as soon as I find somewhere...
- Yeah.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.819
- I'll see ya later.
- Right.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.781
I hadn't finished yet!

23:12.766 --> 23:15.895
Tom? Tom? You about?

23:15.978 --> 23:17.855
Tom: With you in a minute.

23:20.441 --> 23:23.319
- Joe, how are things?
- Oh, not so bad.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.737
Mind if I carry on?

23:24.820 --> 23:27.448
- Busy, I see.
- Oh, not bad.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.200
Joe:
Still got your picture gallery, then?

23:30.284 --> 23:32.953
You dirty old bastard.

23:33.037 --> 23:36.081
Make good dart boards.
You should see how my aim's improved.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.792
Here, pass that grease gun, will ya?

23:42.630 --> 23:44.548
How's the cab business, then?

23:44.632 --> 23:46.508
Oh, mustn't grumble.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.931
Thing is, I, er...

23:52.556 --> 23:54.475
I did want to
ask you a favour, mate.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.978
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Um...

23:58.854 --> 24:00.648
You know that flat
you've got upstairs?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.733
Yeah? What about it?

24:02.816 --> 24:05.527
- Well, it's got two bedrooms, right?
- Just about. Yeah.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.696
Yeah.
Well, I've got this problem, see.

24:07.738 --> 24:10.324
Like, I've gotta find
somewhere to live, and, er...

24:10.407 --> 24:12.660
Well, seeing as how we're mates...

24:12.743 --> 24:14.304
I mean, I'd help
towards the rent and that.

24:14.328 --> 24:17.414
Listen, Joe, any time,
you know that.

24:17.498 --> 24:19.249
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.394
I mean, if you'd asked me
a couple of weeks ago, no problem.

24:21.418 --> 24:24.018
But, the trouble, is I've got a lady
living with me at the moment.

24:24.046 --> 24:26.590
Don't tell me you need two beds.
You must be slipping.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.051
No, no, no, it's not that.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.012
Look, Joe, I'll be straight with you.
You know women.

24:32.096 --> 24:35.557
You never know how they'll react.
I mean, well, Nikki's a nice lady, but...

24:35.641 --> 24:38.477
- Well, she does work odd hours.
- Yeah?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.354
Has its advantages, I suppose.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.691
I wouldn't ask
if I wasn't really desperate.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.526
Just till I get
something else fixed up.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.778
All right, all right.
Just for a couple of weeks,

24:47.820 --> 24:50.239
- till you find somewhere.
- Yeah.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.574
Woman: Is this a private party
or can anyone join in?

24:52.658 --> 24:55.452
Hello! Talk of the devil!

24:56.078 --> 24:58.956
I'll say this for Tom,
he certainly knows how to pick 'em.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.499
Now, she's obviously a bit of class.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.435
Probably an air hostess,
or something like that.

25:02.459 --> 25:05.254
Tom: This is Nikki.
She's a stripper.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.548
Well, you can't always
be right, can ya?

25:08.132 --> 25:10.259
Joe's comin' to stay
with us for a while.

25:10.342 --> 25:14.054
- Oh, nice. When?
- Joe: How about now?

25:14.138 --> 25:16.640
Nikki:
You weren't kiddin', were you?

25:16.724 --> 25:19.164
Well, I don't believe in hanging about
once me mind's made up.

25:19.268 --> 25:22.771
You, er...
Plannin' on stayin' long, then?

25:22.855 --> 25:25.315
Well, just till
I get meself sorted out,

25:25.399 --> 25:27.234
find a nice little place to live.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.111
Oh, if you hear of
anywhere that's going,

25:29.194 --> 25:30.446
not too expensive.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.072
Oh, yeah. Sure.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.824
She fancies me. I can tell.

25:33.949 --> 25:37.119
I could pull this one.
Dead easy. No problem.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.580
I expect you're like me.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.123
Work odd hours.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.375
Yeah, I do a bit.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.711
I suppose that means we won't...

25:45.794 --> 25:47.588
See a lot of each other, then.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.382
Do you fancy a quick one before I go?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.553
Oh! Er... no, thanks.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.346
Better get out
and earn some money.

25:56.430 --> 25:59.099
- Like me to drop you off?
- Oh yeah, great.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.477
Save me gettin' a cab.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.812
Yeah, I could definitely
make it with her,

26:03.896 --> 26:05.898
but I think I'd better
put in a bit of hard graft,

26:05.939 --> 26:07.149
earn meself some money.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.235
Yes, that's what I'm gonna
concentrate on for a bit, money.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.909
Nikki!

27:40.993 --> 27:43.620
- Nikki! Nikki!
- What?

27:43.829 --> 27:45.956
No, stand back, for god's sake.
Stand back.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.333
Why? What's happened?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.878
It's a... in there.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.215
No, don't go any closer.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.719
Oh, don't be silly.

27:58.802 --> 28:02.264
- But it's a...
- It's monty.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.099
Oh, don't touch it.

28:04.141 --> 28:07.019
They bite, you know.
They're... they're poisonous!

28:07.144 --> 28:09.730
Monty is a python,

28:09.897 --> 28:12.024
and they don't bite.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.777
Anyway, he wouldn't hurt anyone,
would you, monty?

28:15.819 --> 28:18.363
Are you trying to tell me...

28:18.447 --> 28:22.868
- Is that thing yours?
- Well, of course it is.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.537
And don't shout.

28:25.579 --> 28:28.916
You'll upset him.
He's very highly strung.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.919
Well, what's he doing in my bath?

28:32.002 --> 28:34.922
Where else could I put him?

28:35.005 --> 28:37.966
Anyway, he likes it in the bath.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.302
Keep that horrible thing away from me.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.387
I'm telling you,
you'll have to get rid of it.

28:42.471 --> 28:45.641
It's not staying here.
You'll have to get rid of it.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.643
Get rid of it?

28:47.726 --> 28:48.810
I can't.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.563
And, even if I wanted to,
which I don't,

28:51.647 --> 28:54.441
- he's part of my act.
- Change your act.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.069
Change my act?

28:57.152 --> 29:01.782
Monty is a huge success
and you don't replace that in a hurry.

29:01.907 --> 29:05.244
- Do you, darlin'?
- Oh, will you stop doing that?

29:05.327 --> 29:08.830
Gives me the horrors, those beady
little eyes starin' at me all the time.

29:08.956 --> 29:11.959
I don't know why
you're making such a fuss.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.877
Give me his basket.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.511
I don't know how you'd feel
if you found a snake in your bath.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.721
I mean, I almost
had a heart attack.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.932
Are you sure that thing's
gonna be safe in there?

29:27.015 --> 29:29.685
Yes, of course he is.

29:29.810 --> 29:32.771
Monty is very well behaved.

29:34.356 --> 29:37.401
In you go. There we are.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.768
- Hello, Gerry, bill.
- Wotcha, Joe.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.313
- Pick any winners, did ya?
- Nah.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.814
Oh, it's a mug's game, that.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.066
You wanna give it up, mate,
save your money.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.735
Hello, sexy.

30:20.193 --> 30:23.071
It's my money. Might as well
spend it on that as anything else.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.508
Better than throwing it away
on ruddy women all the time, like you.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.284
What are you talking about?
I make them pay.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.952
That's the secret, mate.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.829
Sex maniac, that's what you are.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.998
Nah, you're just too old, mate,
that's your trouble.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.958
Can't get it up any more.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.978
From what I've heard,
you can't get yours down, mate.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.879
All part of me worldly charm, innit?

30:38.962 --> 30:41.131
Oh, that's what they call it, is it?

30:41.214 --> 30:42.507
What's the matter with you, eh?

30:42.591 --> 30:44.718
You forgotten what it's like?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.470
He thinks he invented sex.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.139
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, dora.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.897
- Haven't seen you for a while.
- Been busy, ain't I?

30:56.938 --> 30:58.732
Dora: Two dog rolls, two teas.

30:58.815 --> 31:02.027
The way he carries on, I'm surprised
it ain't dropped off by now.

31:02.152 --> 31:03.862
Go on. You're just jealous.

31:03.987 --> 31:07.282
Ah, like hell. You get to my age,
you've done it all, ain't ya?

31:07.366 --> 31:09.242
I get to your age,
I'll need to have done.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.244
Ah, get lost, mate.

31:11.328 --> 31:14.831
You reckon that's all there is
to this job, don't you? Pulling birds.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.209
Joe: And what do you reckon
it's all about, then?

31:17.292 --> 31:19.127
You're all the bloody same.

31:19.252 --> 31:22.089
Out on the road for a couple of years,
think you know it all.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.132
- You'll find out.
- Yeah?

31:24.216 --> 31:25.926
Dora:
How's that dreadful brother of yours?

31:26.009 --> 31:27.219
What? Peter?

31:27.260 --> 31:28.595
Dreadful.

31:29.971 --> 31:32.391
- What do you fancy, then?
- What do you think?

31:32.474 --> 31:34.893
- Give us a dog roll, will you?
- One dog roll.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.978
He's gonna get done
one of these days,

31:37.062 --> 31:38.062
the way he carries on.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.482
More than likely.
Still, I shan't be there to see it.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.359
Moved out.
Couldn't stand it any longer.

31:42.442 --> 31:43.693
Got me own place now.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.822
- Moved in with Carol, have you?
- Not bloody likely.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.533
Yeah? When are you gonna
invite me round, then?

31:49.616 --> 31:51.159
Any time you like, darlin'.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.161
Well, I'm free tonight.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.539
Funny you should say that.
So am I.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.833
- Pick you up about seven, right?
- Right.

32:13.807 --> 32:17.769
Joe, if I let you, you know...

32:17.853 --> 32:20.021
You wouldn't think me cheap,
would you?

32:20.147 --> 32:21.273
Cheap?

32:21.356 --> 32:23.150
No, 'course not.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.777
Drinking double gins all evening.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.614
'Course not.
It's being emotionally honest.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.116
What could be wrong with that?

32:31.241 --> 32:34.119
Besides, with a fabulous figure
like you got,

32:34.202 --> 32:37.664
it'd be criminal to hide it away,
now, wouldn't it?

32:40.459 --> 32:42.377
I'll tell you something,

32:42.419 --> 32:44.963
you've got the most
beautiful breasts I've ever seen.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.923
Have I?

32:47.007 --> 32:50.177
- I have dreams about them.
- You don't. Really?

33:00.103 --> 33:02.189
I'll tell you something else, too,

33:02.272 --> 33:03.982
they're even better
with nothing on.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.428
Oh, Joe...

33:40.310 --> 33:42.771
Oh, oh...

33:48.860 --> 33:50.278
Oh, Joe...

33:50.987 --> 33:54.241
Oh, darling, you're fantastic.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.912
But I haven't even
got me trousers off yet.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.916
Joe...

34:28.275 --> 34:30.569
What a scene that was last night!

34:31.319 --> 34:33.697
Makes you wonder whether
it's all worthwhile, don't it?

34:33.738 --> 34:37.117
Just got to deliver this parcel.
Should be fairly straightforward.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.370
Well, I don't think I could take
any more excitement, not for a while.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.881
Mrs devere barker?

34:51.965 --> 34:53.508
Parcel for you.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.719
Oh. Mmm.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.679
Bring it in, would you?

35:05.604 --> 35:09.274
Oh, if you'd just like to
pop it down over there.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.776
I daren't touch it, you see.
It's my nails.

35:11.818 --> 35:14.362
- It's your what, love?
- Nails.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.657
Tropical green, number three.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.117
Very exotic.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.080
The second they're dry,
I'll be able to pay you,

35:21.202 --> 35:23.830
only I just daren't touch anything
while they're like this.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.458
No, it's all right, you just
stand there and dry off.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.293
- I'm in no hurry.
- Oh.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.657
You wouldn't like a drink
while you're waiting, would you?

35:30.712 --> 35:33.214
No, thanks, I'm driving.
But thanks, all the same.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.925
Oh, not even a cold beer,
something like that?

35:36.009 --> 35:37.636
Well, iwouldn't
mind a beer, actually.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.347
Oh, do help yourself.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.354
Actually, darling,
you couldn't do me

35:47.437 --> 35:50.649
a large campari and soda,
could you, while you're there?

35:50.732 --> 35:52.275
Yeah.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.320
- A large one?
- Yes, please.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.533
- Say when.
- I never do.

36:06.539 --> 36:11.086
Oh, be an angel, would you,
and just slip it between my lips?

36:11.211 --> 36:13.546
Oh, the glass. Yes, of course.

36:15.715 --> 36:17.217
Mmm.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.969
Sorry to put you
to all this inconvenience.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.096
Don't mention it.

36:21.137 --> 36:24.557
It's just I always seem to get
caught out when someone arrives.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.811
Yesterday, it was
the television repairman.

36:27.936 --> 36:29.562
The day before,
it was the plumber,

36:29.646 --> 36:32.857
and, as for the window cleaner,
well, every time he comes now,

36:32.899 --> 36:36.194
- I seem to be in the bath.
- I see.

36:36.403 --> 36:39.280
Oh, you wouldn't be an angel,
would you, and...

36:39.572 --> 36:41.032
Undo it for me?

36:42.075 --> 36:42.951
Mmm.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.161
It's for a dinner tonight.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.830
My husband's in cement.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.915
Oh? Must be uncomfortable for him.

36:48.998 --> 36:53.044
It's a presentation dinner, you see,
so I thought I'd wear green

36:53.128 --> 36:55.296
to go with my nail varnish.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.756
- Very nice.
- Mmm.

36:58.007 --> 37:01.720
Seems to be all right now.
You're not in a rush, are you?

37:01.803 --> 37:05.807
It's just I'd like to try it on
to make sure it fits.

37:05.890 --> 37:09.060
- No, no, of course not.
- Oh. Good.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.111
Some gaff this, innit?

37:18.194 --> 37:19.946
Must cost a packet.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.948
I bet she does, and all.

37:22.615 --> 37:26.619
Make yourself at home, won't you?
I shan't be long.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.329
What about her, then?

37:28.413 --> 37:30.123
Bit of all right.

37:30.874 --> 37:35.211
"Shan't be long.
My husband's in cement." Bloody hell.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.642
Have you lost something?

37:50.518 --> 37:51.644
Balls.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.897
Er... they fell off.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.816
Oh. Never mind.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.652
You couldn't give me a hand
with the zip, could you?

37:59.736 --> 38:03.364
It seems to be stuck, and I
don't want to break a nail on it.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.492
These birds and their zips.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.536
Jesus.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.246
It's a bit stiff.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.500
It won't be the only thing
if she carries on like this.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.920
Yeah, I see what you mean.
It is stuck, isn't it?

38:17.003 --> 38:18.630
Maybe if you pull it?

38:18.713 --> 38:21.049
That had crossed my mind.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.343
- Have you done it?
- Yeah, I think so.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.804
Oh. Seems a bit loose.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.056
Oh. Look at that.
Just look at it.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.391
That's just so typical
of today's workmanship.

38:30.475 --> 38:33.228
That's the last dress
I shall buy from there.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.730
Yeah, disgraceful.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.649
Now, what shall I do?

38:44.030 --> 38:47.283
Well, it was the only thing
I could think of, wasn't it?

39:42.714 --> 39:44.257
Another satisfied customer.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.634
And the dress did fit, after all.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.636
Six pou...

39:49.596 --> 39:52.599
I suppose I can't really ask her
for me fare now.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.372
I promised that Nikki
I'd pick her up from the club.

40:16.456 --> 40:19.834
Mustn't be late, in case
she sets that snake on to me.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.003
This is the one, I think.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.154
How about it, then, guv?

40:48.237 --> 40:50.782
Twelve beautiful girls,
do everything.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.660
All naked and they dance.

40:53.910 --> 40:56.537
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Inside.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.081
Not without paying, you're not.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.804
Oh, I'm not goin' in,
not to see the show.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.709
I'm just pickin' up Nikki, that's all.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.628
Yeah. You and a few others.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.965
No, honest. I'm a cab driver.
Look, me cab's just outside.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.050
Nah, could be anyone's.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.779
Look, if you think you're gonna
gain admittance here without paying,

41:11.803 --> 41:12.947
you've got another think
coming to ya.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.223
I'm telling you,
I'm only here to collect Nikki.

41:15.390 --> 41:18.285
I mean, do us a favour, mate. I'll
give you me licence number if you like.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.852
You can check it.

41:19.936 --> 41:22.772
I know all the taxi drivers round
here, mate. I don't know yourface.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.792
Well, that's 'cause
I don't normally do this patch.

41:24.816 --> 41:28.778
I'm only here to collect Nikki.
I live in the same flat as her, see?

41:30.113 --> 41:33.116
You're not the one
who went to bed with monty?

41:33.199 --> 41:35.618
Oh, god!

41:35.660 --> 41:39.706
What, by accident, was it?
Or did you need the help?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.583
Go on. Get down.

41:58.683 --> 41:59.934
Sorry, mate.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.676
Joe, would you mind hangin' on
just a minute?

42:33.760 --> 42:35.428
I've just gotta nip back
and get monty.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.138
- No rush.
- Okay.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.967
- Okay?
- W hat?

43:15.051 --> 43:16.594
You comin' or not?

43:16.677 --> 43:18.930
Well, if you're not quite ready,
I don't mind.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.816
- That's Helga.
- Oh?

43:30.775 --> 43:35.071
You can put your eyeballs back in.
I've invited her for supper tonight.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.906
Foreign, is she?

43:38.699 --> 43:40.743
She's a nun from scunthorpe.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.161
Come on.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.794
- That was lovely, Nikki.
- Mmm.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.420
Oh, it was nothing special.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.089
Oh, I enjoyed it.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.549
Now, what?

43:54.632 --> 43:56.151
Oh, I've got
some yoghurt in the fridge.

43:56.175 --> 43:58.469
- No, I meant what shall we do now?
- You decide.

43:58.553 --> 44:01.139
Why don't we play a game? Hmm?

44:01.222 --> 44:02.890
What about strip poker?

44:06.727 --> 44:10.022
Oh, come on, it might be fun.
What do you say, Tom?

44:10.148 --> 44:11.899
No. He doesn't want to play.

44:11.983 --> 44:14.068
Oh, come on. Just for a giggle.

44:14.152 --> 44:17.989
- Got any cards?
- Cards? Er... no.

44:19.782 --> 44:23.077
Well, how about spinning
the bottle instead? Hmm?

44:25.872 --> 44:27.039
Okay.

44:29.125 --> 44:31.460
Well, I think I'll read my book.

44:32.962 --> 44:35.162
We could always play
strip ouija board, if you'd prefer?

44:35.214 --> 44:37.592
Ouija board? What ouija board?

44:37.675 --> 44:39.886
No, let's spin the bottle.

46:09.183 --> 46:11.352
Um... I'll get it.

46:19.819 --> 46:21.862
Where's Joe? I came to see him.

46:21.988 --> 46:24.365
Oh. Er... he's not in. He's out.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.617
No. His taxi's here.

46:26.659 --> 46:28.911
It's all right.
He is expecting me.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.130
Hello. I'm Carol.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.590
Carol hotchkiss. Joe's fiancée.

46:41.799 --> 46:45.553
I expect he's spoken of me.
Which is his room? That one?

46:45.636 --> 46:47.513
Thank you, dear.

46:53.311 --> 46:56.022
Carol! Listen, I can explain.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.906
It's the third house along,
on the right. Number 42.

47:06.032 --> 47:07.700
Joe: Right you are.

47:08.367 --> 47:09.660
Do you want a hand with those?

47:09.785 --> 47:11.787
Would you? Oh, thank you.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.021
You can just put them down here.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.291
Joe: Oh, that's all right.
I don't mind carrying them in for ya.

47:39.315 --> 47:41.359
That's very kind of you.

47:49.408 --> 47:52.119
- I can't find my key.
- Are you sure?

47:52.203 --> 47:54.538
Perhaps it's in your bag, loose?

47:54.622 --> 47:55.956
I'll try.

48:02.963 --> 48:04.423
It's not there.

48:05.841 --> 48:08.511
- What about pockets?
- I haven't got any.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.429
What am I going to do?

48:10.513 --> 48:13.391
Perhaps you could go to a neighbour's
till your husband gets home.

48:13.474 --> 48:17.395
He's away. On a business trip.
I can't even get hold of him.

48:18.312 --> 48:19.688
Don't you have a spare somewhere?

48:19.772 --> 48:21.315
- Yes, of course.
- Oh, well, then.

48:21.399 --> 48:22.733
It's inside.

48:22.817 --> 48:25.361
I thought you might have one
under a flower pot or something.

48:25.444 --> 48:27.405
Harold, that's my husband,

48:27.488 --> 48:29.990
Harold's nervous
about burglars getting in.

48:30.074 --> 48:32.576
All very well,
but how do [get in?

48:32.660 --> 48:35.037
I could try to climb in,
isuppose.

48:35.121 --> 48:37.790
But you'll have to help me.
You will, won't you?

48:38.666 --> 48:41.043
Icantleave
a lady in distress, can I?

48:43.254 --> 48:45.256
Let's see if there's
a window open somewhere.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.216
Oh, there won't be one of those.

49:37.516 --> 49:39.018
Thank you.

49:41.270 --> 49:43.230
You will be careful, won't you?

49:43.355 --> 49:45.357
Safe as houses, darlin'.

49:56.285 --> 49:57.953
Are you all right?

49:58.871 --> 49:59.997
What's happened?

50:00.498 --> 50:01.832
Are you all right?

50:02.708 --> 50:04.835
Say something, please.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.756
What's happening up there?

50:12.218 --> 50:13.969
I didn't know
what had happened to you.

50:14.053 --> 50:16.430
I called and called,
but you didn't answer.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.183
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.519
Look, you go down and
I'll open the front door.

50:21.685 --> 50:24.146
I can't. I'm stuck.

50:24.230 --> 50:26.690
What do you mean, stuck?
Just go back down the way you came.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.943
I can't. I daren't look down.

50:29.068 --> 50:31.070
I'll fall.
I'm frightened of heights.

50:31.195 --> 50:32.571
Look, it's quite simple.

50:32.655 --> 50:35.032
If you can't go down,
you'd better come on up.

50:35.115 --> 50:36.659
I can't move. I'm scared.

50:36.742 --> 50:39.036
All right, then, go back down
the way you came.

50:39.495 --> 50:40.746
Help me.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.498
All right. Now, don't panic.

50:42.623 --> 50:45.376
You're quite safe.
Just do as I say. Okay?

50:45.417 --> 50:48.212
Now, put one hand
on the next rung up.

50:48.295 --> 50:49.380
Go on, one more.

50:49.463 --> 50:51.382
Now the other one.

50:51.507 --> 50:52.841
Keep going. You're okay.

50:52.925 --> 50:56.637
I'm watchin' ya. Up a bit.
No, down, just a little.

50:56.720 --> 50:57.763
Now, in.

50:57.846 --> 50:59.682
Towards the wall, that's it.

50:59.765 --> 51:01.976
Go on, you're doing fine.
Come on.

51:03.561 --> 51:05.854
It's all right, you're nearly there.

51:05.896 --> 51:08.190
That's it.
Now, give me your hand.

51:08.399 --> 51:09.316
Lovely.

51:09.400 --> 51:12.861
- I can't put my feet...
- Oh, you're doing wonderful.

51:13.821 --> 51:16.782
There ya 90. You're there

51:16.907 --> 51:21.161
- through the window...
- Oh. Oh.

51:21.245 --> 51:23.956
Oh! Oh, you're all wet.

51:25.833 --> 51:27.126
I should have warned you.

51:27.209 --> 51:29.587
- Oh, I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
- Yeah, well.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.314
And, of course, that's why
I left the window open,

51:31.338 --> 51:33.007
to let the smell of paint out.

51:33.799 --> 51:35.134
Oh, and look at your clothes.

51:35.217 --> 51:36.927
They're covered in it.

51:37.011 --> 51:38.530
Oh, you have to let me
wash them for you.

51:38.554 --> 51:39.614
You can't go out like that.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.640
Oh, well, that's, er...
Very nice of you to offer.

51:41.724 --> 51:43.785
Well, I think the least I can do
is clean your clothes

51:43.809 --> 51:46.186
and give you a bath, don't you?

51:51.609 --> 51:54.486
I do like huge bubbly ones, don't you?

51:54.570 --> 51:55.738
Yeah.

51:56.905 --> 51:58.699
That's about right, now.

52:00.534 --> 52:03.537
- Oh, I can't wait to get in.
- Neither can I.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.373
Bubbles make me
go all tingly all over.

52:06.707 --> 52:08.417
You as well?

52:13.922 --> 52:17.426
Ooh, it feels all lovely.
All tingly.

52:17.509 --> 52:18.969
What a way to go!

52:31.982 --> 52:33.442
Marion?

52:53.837 --> 52:55.506
Marion!

53:01.345 --> 53:03.639
Marion, where are you?

53:04.223 --> 53:06.100
- Hide!
- Marion, you in the bath?

53:07.059 --> 53:09.186
Ah, there you are.
Didn't you hear me shouting?

53:09.269 --> 53:13.107
Oh, darling, what a lovely surprise.
I wasn't expecting you.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.734
Harold: What a complete shambles.
The whole trip.

53:15.818 --> 53:18.278
Oh, you poor love.
Why don't you go downstairs,

53:18.362 --> 53:20.698
put your feet up, and pour
yourself out a nice long drink,

53:20.781 --> 53:23.158
and I'll join you, and you
can tell me all about it.

53:23.283 --> 53:24.785
Well, there's nothing to tell.

53:24.868 --> 53:27.496
The entire fiasco was predictable
from start to finish,

53:27.621 --> 53:29.057
and you know
who's responsible, don't you?

53:29.081 --> 53:32.251
- Well, I told 'em, I warned 'em.
- Yes, you did.

53:32.418 --> 53:34.753
"You put Peters in as
acting managing director,

53:34.837 --> 53:37.548
"and you've got nothing but trouble
on your hands," I said.

53:37.631 --> 53:40.342
"He can't cope with responsibility,

53:40.467 --> 53:42.261
"he's got no initiative,

53:42.386 --> 53:44.138
"runs a Ford anglia,
and doesn't play golf.

53:44.221 --> 53:45.889
"You Mark my words."

53:46.014 --> 53:48.225
Well, I've been
proved right yet again.

53:48.350 --> 53:50.269
Oh, that's wonderful.

53:50.352 --> 53:51.912
Now, why don't you
just go downstairs...

53:51.937 --> 53:53.439
Harold: "Wonderful"?

53:53.522 --> 53:56.275
It's frustrating.
Well, it's... it's insulting.

53:56.358 --> 53:58.235
Oh, I quite agree.

53:58.318 --> 54:00.118
Now, why don't you
just let me finish my bath,

54:00.195 --> 54:02.197
and I'll be straight with you?

54:02.948 --> 54:05.325
Yes, I...
I could do with a drink.

54:09.079 --> 54:10.748
- What was that?
- Nothing.

54:10.831 --> 54:12.875
Just knocked the plug, that's all.

54:16.545 --> 54:18.881
Oh, darling, um...
Can I get you anything?

54:18.964 --> 54:20.299
- What?
- To drink.

54:20.382 --> 54:23.761
- No, just go downstairs and I'll be...
- Marion, is it really necessary

54:23.844 --> 54:26.305
to use all that much bubble bath?

54:26.805 --> 54:29.242
You only bought this last week
and you've already finished it.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.685
You really must be
more careful in future.

54:31.769 --> 54:34.146
I can't afford
extravagance of this sort.

54:34.229 --> 54:37.065
I mean, how you expect me
to raise your housekeeping allowance

54:37.149 --> 54:41.195
in the face of such flagrant wastage,
I really don't know.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.697
Really must pull yourself
together, you know.

54:43.739 --> 54:45.741
You're getting very careless lately.

54:45.908 --> 54:48.702
Won't do, you know.
No, won't do.

54:49.745 --> 54:51.580
It's all right.

54:53.081 --> 54:54.750
Marion, I meant to ask you,

54:54.833 --> 54:57.252
what on earth have you been
doing in the bedroom?

54:57.377 --> 55:00.214
There's paint all over the place.
It's a terrible mess.

55:00.297 --> 55:03.258
It's the decorators.
It was meant to be a surprise.

55:03.425 --> 55:07.054
Surprise? I should think the only
surprise I'd get would be the bill.

55:07.137 --> 55:09.257
Don't suppose you've thought
to get an estimate first?

55:09.306 --> 55:13.268
- Oh, Harold...
- Never mind. Don't upset yourself.

55:13.352 --> 55:16.063
I mean... no, I expect you...

55:16.480 --> 55:18.982
You meant well,
yes, like Peters.

55:19.107 --> 55:21.777
He meant well, I expect,
incompetent clodhopper.

55:21.902 --> 55:23.737
But the board, listen?
Would they listen?

55:23.821 --> 55:27.032
Please, Harold,
the water's getting cold.

55:27.115 --> 55:29.576
Oh. Ah. Yes. Well, er...

55:29.868 --> 55:32.120
Yes, well, you have your bath
and, um...

55:32.496 --> 55:34.540
Don't you worry about a thing.

55:34.665 --> 55:37.167
No, it was a...
A lovely surprise

55:37.251 --> 55:39.586
to find paint
all over the bedroom.

55:40.045 --> 55:42.297
Yes, I think I do need a drink.

55:42.506 --> 55:45.300
It's all right now.
It's all right now.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.427
Come on, quick!

55:56.770 --> 56:00.357
Harold: I brought you a drink, darling.
I thought you might like one.

56:00.774 --> 56:03.819
Oh, you mustn't stand about like that,
not with the window open.

56:03.902 --> 56:06.697
Oh, no, no. Catch your death.

57:12.262 --> 57:13.805
Sorry, mate, I'm not, um...

57:13.889 --> 57:15.807
St Mary's convent, upton road.

57:15.891 --> 57:17.434
Yeah, but...

57:29.988 --> 57:31.531
Of all the rotten luck.

57:31.615 --> 57:33.575
Anyone else but a nun.

57:33.617 --> 57:36.912
I couldn't very well tell her
to eff off, now, could I?

57:46.922 --> 57:50.258
I wonder if I could trouble you
to help me with my cases?

58:37.347 --> 58:38.890
Oh, I thought
I heard you come in.

58:39.016 --> 58:41.143
It's costin' me a bloody fortune
in jeans, this job.

58:41.309 --> 58:43.687
- How come?
- I keep losin' 'em.

58:43.770 --> 58:45.999
Oh, by the way, your brother
phoned up while you were out.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.524
- What, Peter?
- Yeah.

58:47.649 --> 58:49.877
He said something about having
a whole lot of television sets.

58:49.901 --> 58:52.696
- Did we need one?
- Bloody hell!

58:53.071 --> 58:54.614
Why? What's the matter?

58:54.656 --> 58:57.159
Look, if he phones up again,
tell him, er...

58:57.242 --> 58:59.578
I don't know, tell him
I've left the country, anything.

58:59.661 --> 59:01.180
Why? You don't want
to speak to him, then?

59:01.204 --> 59:02.914
Not if I can avoid it.

59:02.998 --> 59:04.434
I've got enough problems
in me own life

59:04.458 --> 59:06.960
without getting lumbered with him
and his thieving.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.938
I may, er... get into a few scrapes
now and again,

59:08.962 --> 59:11.082
but that's one thing
I've always stayed well clear of,

59:11.131 --> 59:12.674
crime and all that.

59:34.071 --> 59:37.282
You know
what this is, buddy? It's a gun.

59:41.536 --> 59:42.662
Just keep your mouth shut.

59:42.788 --> 59:44.388
Do as you're told
and you won't get hurt.

59:44.414 --> 59:47.501
- Yeah, but...
- I said, "shut up and get going!"

59:48.210 --> 59:52.506
Now, make one wrong move,
and you're dead. Understand?

59:53.882 --> 59:56.843
Just stick to the driving,
keep your eyes on the road,

59:56.968 --> 59:59.721
and you and me'll
get along just fine.

59:59.805 --> 1:00:03.725
Now, drive south,
and no funny business.

1:00:03.809 --> 1:00:05.685
I know this town
like I know my own face.

1:00:05.769 --> 1:00:07.997
If you ask me, we should have
rubbed her out there and then.

1:00:08.021 --> 1:00:09.648
Don't get no troubles with a stiff.

1:00:09.731 --> 1:00:12.067
Nobody's askin' ya, so shut up!

1:00:12.234 --> 1:00:14.152
Supposin' her old man
wants to talk to her?

1:00:14.236 --> 1:00:17.739
Ain't nobody going to pay
no ransom for a stiff, dumb-head.

1:00:17.823 --> 1:00:21.451
We got to keep her alive
to get the dough. Do you get it?

1:00:21.535 --> 1:00:22.911
Yeah.

1:00:22.994 --> 1:00:25.634
Yeah, but she's already seen us,
so why bother with all this stuff?

1:00:25.789 --> 1:00:27.457
So when we call up her old man,

1:00:27.499 --> 1:00:29.417
you want her to tell him
where we stashed her?

1:00:29.501 --> 1:00:32.045
Oh, get it through that
thick skull of yours, dumb-head.

1:00:32.129 --> 1:00:35.465
What she don't know,
she can't tell. Okay?

1:00:36.299 --> 1:00:37.717
Then we rub her out.

1:00:37.843 --> 1:00:40.554
Just stick to the road, pal,
like I told ya.

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:43.515
- Why don't we rub her out?
- Shut that moron up, will ya?

1:00:43.598 --> 1:00:45.642
Do a right... now!

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:52.482
Listen, birdbrain, we don't snuff her
unless there's no other way.

1:00:52.566 --> 1:00:54.025
What if something goes wrong?

1:00:54.109 --> 1:00:56.403
So long as you follow orders,
nothing will.

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:58.697
Now, take the next turning
on the left.

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:01.533
And keep it real cool and steady.

1:01:02.367 --> 1:01:05.120
I am gonna do something.
Soon as I get the chance.

1:01:05.245 --> 1:01:07.325
Bit difficult with a gun
pointing at my head, though.

1:01:12.836 --> 1:01:16.047
Okay, buddy, turn left,
through those gates.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:24.931
Keep goin'.

1:01:28.059 --> 1:01:29.644
Fudhen

1:01:29.728 --> 1:01:31.897
ah, that's it. Now, pull up!

1:01:34.065 --> 1:01:36.067
Get that broad out of the cab.

1:01:36.151 --> 1:01:38.153
Here, didn't we ought to
rub him out, too?

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:40.697
I mean, what's to stop him
shooting his mouth off?

1:01:40.822 --> 1:01:44.951
Okay, buddy. Out of the cab.
Nice and easy, now.

1:01:45.493 --> 1:01:47.787
No sudden moves,
or this baby goes off.

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:52.459
All right, buddy. Out of the cab.
Now, keep it cool.

1:01:52.542 --> 1:01:55.837
Put your hands on your head.
Now, turn around.

1:01:55.921 --> 1:01:57.380
Come on, turn around!

1:01:57.505 --> 1:01:59.674
Now, get movin'. Turn around.

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:14.814
Get up.

1:02:27.535 --> 1:02:29.496
Come on, hands against the wall.

1:02:37.337 --> 1:02:39.339
Look.
Come on, you can relax now.

1:02:39.422 --> 1:02:41.925
Look at him, he fell for it!

1:02:42.592 --> 1:02:44.970
I don't believe it!
Look at his face.

1:02:46.805 --> 1:02:50.058
I'm sorry if we scared ya.
The whole thing was a joke.

1:02:50.141 --> 1:02:51.434
Everything.

1:02:51.518 --> 1:02:53.853
You see, we were at this party...

1:02:53.937 --> 1:02:55.272
And someone suggested

1:02:55.355 --> 1:02:56.958
that we wouldn't dare
try it in the street.

1:02:56.982 --> 1:02:58.858
And that no cabbie would believe it.

1:02:58.942 --> 1:03:00.902
So they bet us twenty quid to do it.

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:03.238
- No hard feelings?
- No hard feelings?

1:03:03.321 --> 1:03:06.199
I've been losin' fares
while you've been doing all this.

1:03:11.121 --> 1:03:13.081
Oh, don't forget
to get the paper signed.

1:03:13.164 --> 1:03:15.041
Oh, yes.
I almost forgot about that.

1:03:15.125 --> 1:03:18.211
We had to bring back some kind of
proof that we actually did it.

1:03:18.295 --> 1:03:21.506
Look, do you think you'd mind signing
your name to this bit of paper?

1:03:21.589 --> 1:03:24.926
And, if you could add your cab number,
that would be great.

1:03:33.351 --> 1:03:34.686
Thanks, mate.

1:03:45.155 --> 1:03:47.198
Male singer: J“ oh, yeah!

1:03:48.491 --> 1:03:50.577
J“ I can see

1:03:51.077 --> 1:03:53.663

j“ we're gonna have a good time

j“ it's true

1:04:24.235 --> 1:04:25.987

j“ we're gonna have a good time j“

1:04:57.310 --> 1:04:59.687
- hello, maisie.
- Hello, Joe.

1:05:00.688 --> 1:05:04.067
Well, come on, love.
Don't be nervous, I won't bite it off.

1:05:07.946 --> 1:05:09.739
- Where to, darlin'?
- Oh, the usual, love.

1:05:09.864 --> 1:05:11.584
- What, round the block?
- Yeah, that'll do.

1:05:11.616 --> 1:05:13.844
Just keep on drivin'. I'll give you
a yell when I'm finished.

1:05:13.868 --> 1:05:16.388
- Right!
- Here, you heard about glenda, didn't you?

1:05:17.497 --> 1:05:19.874
Oh, sorry, love.
Be with you in a minute.

1:05:19.958 --> 1:05:21.793
- Glenda?
- Yeah.

1:05:21.876 --> 1:05:23.878
She married an arab she picked up.

1:05:24.003 --> 1:05:27.298
- I thought I hadn't seen her around.
- Yeah. An arab.

1:05:27.382 --> 1:05:29.676
- With oil Wells and everything.
- No!

1:05:29.759 --> 1:05:33.138
Mind you, it was only a matter of time
before she hooked some old geezer.

1:05:33.221 --> 1:05:35.116
Joe: Funny, I'd never have
thought that about her.

1:05:35.140 --> 1:05:36.450
- Maisie: What, getting married?
- Joe: Yeah.

1:05:36.474 --> 1:05:38.017
What, glenda? You're joking.

1:05:38.101 --> 1:05:41.062
Every time she opened her mouth
a wedding bell popped out.

1:05:43.356 --> 1:05:44.691
So how's business with you?

1:05:44.774 --> 1:05:48.027
Oh, well, it's quietened down a bit
now the tourist season's over,

1:05:48.111 --> 1:05:50.697
but I don't do so bad.

1:05:50.738 --> 1:05:53.700
Tell you what, love, you get it out
and start practising,

1:05:53.825 --> 1:05:55.660
and I'll join you in a minute.

1:05:55.785 --> 1:05:58.496
Here, Joe, could I have
this one on credit?

1:05:58.538 --> 1:06:00.748
You know, I've just had
the electricity bill in...

1:06:00.832 --> 1:06:02.208
Yeah, that's okay.

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:05.587
Oh, you are lovely.
I'll make it up next time, I promise.

1:06:05.712 --> 1:06:08.256
Nah, don't worry about it.
It's my pleasure.

1:06:08.298 --> 1:06:10.925
I'll tell you what, I didn't half
get a fright the other week.

1:06:11.009 --> 1:06:13.136
I thought I'd
caught a dose, didn't I?

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:18.224
All right. Don't worry.
You have a very nasty cough there.

1:06:18.308 --> 1:06:21.561
You should get it seen to.
It might be serious.

1:06:21.644 --> 1:06:23.706
That's the fourth one I've had
this week with a cold.

1:06:23.730 --> 1:06:26.065
I only hope to god
I don't go down with it.

1:06:26.149 --> 1:06:27.317
That's my trouble, you know.

1:06:27.442 --> 1:06:29.861
Anything that's goin' the rounds,
I seem to pick up.

1:06:29.986 --> 1:06:31.571
Yeah, I had noticed.

1:06:31.654 --> 1:06:33.990
Anyway, love,
can't sit here chatting all day.

1:06:34.073 --> 1:06:36.075
I've got to get back to work.

1:06:50.673 --> 1:06:51.716
Ah!

1:06:52.509 --> 1:06:54.719
Oh, my god.

1:07:28.670 --> 1:07:31.464
Something tells me
this could be my lucky night.

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:34.676
- Number 24, you said?
- Twenty-four. Yes.

1:07:35.051 --> 1:07:37.262
Oh, a right little
sex bomb, this one.

1:07:37.387 --> 1:07:39.722
I mean, you can tell
from that voice, can't ya, eh?

1:07:39.806 --> 1:07:42.350
All husky and sexy.

1:07:42.559 --> 1:07:45.895
I reckon this one'll need the smooth,
suave James Bond type chat-up.

1:07:46.187 --> 1:07:47.939
You, er...

1:07:48.064 --> 1:07:50.108
You in the movies, then?

1:07:50.233 --> 1:07:51.526
Sorry?

1:07:51.609 --> 1:07:54.737
No, it's just that I thought
I recognised your face from somewhere.

1:07:54.821 --> 1:07:58.116
I'd swear I'd seen you on the telly
or the pictures, somewhere like that.

1:07:58.199 --> 1:08:00.201
- Possibly.
- I knew it.

1:08:00.285 --> 1:08:05.081
I knew you were in show business.
Are you famous, then?

1:08:05.164 --> 1:08:08.751
Well, if I was, you'd know who I am,
wouldn't you?

1:08:08.835 --> 1:08:10.169
Yeah, well, I do. It's just that

1:08:10.253 --> 1:08:12.672
your name escapes me
for the moment. That's all.

1:08:12.797 --> 1:08:14.007
Bunny McQueen.

1:08:14.090 --> 1:08:18.720
Bunny McQueen! Of course.
How could I ever forget that?

1:08:19.429 --> 1:08:22.056
Bunny McQueen? Oh, I get it.

1:08:22.140 --> 1:08:24.976
"Bunny."
must work at that playboy club.

1:08:25.059 --> 1:08:27.020
One of those birds
with long, floppy ears,

1:08:27.103 --> 1:08:28.980
all dressed up like rabbits.

1:08:29.772 --> 1:08:32.317
Yeah, probably been
in that playboy magazine.

1:08:32.442 --> 1:08:35.737
You know, playmate of the month?

1:08:36.154 --> 1:08:39.490
I bet if! Looked, I'd find a picture
of you on Tom's garage wall.

1:08:39.574 --> 1:08:42.452
- Who's Tom?
- Oh, he's a guy I live with.

1:08:42.535 --> 1:08:44.829
- Oh, is he nice?
- Yeah, he's all right.

1:08:44.912 --> 1:08:47.582
He's not as nice as you, though.

1:08:47.999 --> 1:08:50.001
She fancies me, don't she?

1:08:50.084 --> 1:08:52.670
Oh, I'm in here
if I play me cards right.

1:09:03.056 --> 1:09:06.309
Make yourself at home.

1:09:11.731 --> 1:09:14.025
Sit down. Relax.

1:09:14.359 --> 1:09:18.071
I should sit over there if I were you.
It's more comfortable.

1:09:21.574 --> 1:09:24.327
I'll just, er... get the wine.

1:09:26.537 --> 1:09:31.250
- There we are.
- Well, here we are, then.

1:09:31.918 --> 1:09:34.295
- Have you been together long?
- What?

1:09:34.379 --> 1:09:37.757
- This boy you live with.
- Oh, Tom. No, just a few weeks.

1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:39.902
Well, we've known each other
for a couple of years now.

1:09:39.926 --> 1:09:41.846
But we've only been living together
a short time.

1:09:41.928 --> 1:09:45.264
Well, he's not going to getjealous,
if he comes back and finds me here?

1:09:45.348 --> 1:09:48.935
No, probably fancy you himself.

1:09:49.644 --> 1:09:51.187
Oh, let me.

1:09:55.233 --> 1:09:57.068
Oh, must need a new flint.

1:09:57.151 --> 1:09:59.570
Hang on, I've got
some matches somewhere.

1:10:06.119 --> 1:10:08.079
Sorry about that.

1:10:21.008 --> 1:10:23.028
I think that's a really great
outfit you're wearin'.

1:10:23.052 --> 1:10:26.973
Oh, do you like it?
I design all my own clothes.

1:10:27.056 --> 1:10:29.016
Yeah, well, it looks terrific.

1:10:29.058 --> 1:10:31.102
I suppose I shouldn't really
be wearing it now,

1:10:31.227 --> 1:10:33.354
but after I finish work
I just want to get away.

1:10:33.479 --> 1:10:35.356
I can't be bothered to change.

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:38.067
Oh, no, you mustn't change.
I mean, you look great as you are.

1:10:38.151 --> 1:10:42.822
A real turn-on. Honest.
It's a tough one, this.

1:10:43.448 --> 1:10:44.741
Oh, do you want me to do it?

1:10:44.866 --> 1:10:47.535
No, no. It's all right.
I'll get it out in a minute.

1:10:47.577 --> 1:10:49.370
Come on.
Why don't you let me try?

1:10:49.454 --> 1:10:51.873
No, you'll never do it.

1:10:55.376 --> 1:10:58.796
- Have you got the glasses ready?
- What? Oh, yeah.

1:11:02.049 --> 1:11:05.136
Sorry, we're a bit, er...
Short on glasses.

1:11:10.683 --> 1:11:13.186
Well, this is very nice.

1:11:13.936 --> 1:11:16.230
Thank you.

1:11:16.647 --> 1:11:18.733
I think you're very nice.

1:11:18.816 --> 1:11:20.359
You, er...

1:11:20.443 --> 1:11:21.694
Comfortable, are you?

1:11:21.778 --> 1:11:23.780
Mmm. Thank you.

1:11:24.113 --> 1:11:26.324
I think you're really something.

1:11:26.407 --> 1:11:27.742
Really, I do.

1:11:29.452 --> 1:11:32.330
I hope you won't mind
if I say this, but, er...

1:11:33.039 --> 1:11:36.167
I think you've got the most
beautifully-shaped breasts I've ever seen.

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:40.505
- Really beautiful.
- Yes. Yes, they're much better now.

1:11:40.588 --> 1:11:42.673
Mind you, they cost me a fortune.

1:11:42.757 --> 1:11:47.595
So, um... why don't we give them
a little air to breathe, eh?

1:11:52.225 --> 1:11:54.435
You've got lovely legs and all.

1:11:54.519 --> 1:11:55.645
Really lovely.

1:11:55.728 --> 1:11:57.939
Bunny:
I have to shave them, of course.

1:12:00.775 --> 1:12:02.151
Bloody hell!

1:12:02.235 --> 1:12:04.153
- What's the matter?
- You!

1:12:04.278 --> 1:12:06.656
- You're a fella!
- But of course I am.

1:12:06.739 --> 1:12:09.116
What did you think I was?

1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:12.036
Wonder if I could have him
under the trades descriptions act?

1:12:55.079 --> 1:12:57.290
- Christ almighty!
- Get going, mister, fast.

1:12:57.415 --> 1:13:00.042
- Where to?
- Never mind now, just drive.

1:13:00.126 --> 1:13:01.669
Help! Help, I've been robbed!

1:13:07.758 --> 1:13:10.761
Must have gone to the same party.
Still, tenner a time, I should care.

1:13:10.845 --> 1:13:13.014
- I'll play the game.
- Look, can't you go any faster?

1:13:13.055 --> 1:13:15.701
I'm doing my best, guv, but watch out
for the law. I don't want to get done.

1:13:15.725 --> 1:13:17.605
Yeah, we'll take care of that.
Just drive. Left.

1:13:18.769 --> 1:13:21.731
Christ almighty,
you might give me some warning.

1:13:21.814 --> 1:13:24.334
Police radio: All cars, all cars west.
A robbery in praed street.

1:13:24.358 --> 1:13:26.861
Your attention is called
to a black London taxi,

1:13:26.986 --> 1:13:30.573
believed to contain suspects.
Roger 1505, thank you, over.

1:13:30.656 --> 1:13:32.450
What do we do, stop them all?

1:13:33.034 --> 1:13:34.577
Turn right.
Just where that Van is.

1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:36.597
Wouldn't it be easier if you told me
where we're making for?

1:13:36.621 --> 1:13:38.432
I mean, we're gonna
have an accident at this rate.

1:13:38.456 --> 1:13:40.041
Look, I'm givin'
the orders round here,

1:13:40.124 --> 1:13:42.376
so shut up and keep drivin'.

1:13:42.835 --> 1:13:44.479
Oh, well, I suppose they've
got to come on heavy,

1:13:44.503 --> 1:13:45.755
otherwise it wouldn't count.

1:13:45.838 --> 1:13:48.215
I wonder when they get round
to the bit about doing me in?

1:13:48.257 --> 1:13:51.385
Not as good as the last lot.
Nah, much more realistic, they were.

1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:54.597
Are we being followed?

1:13:57.475 --> 1:13:59.560
- Don't think so.
- That's all right.

1:13:59.644 --> 1:14:02.021
Going in the opposite direction.

1:14:02.146 --> 1:14:04.082
It's all clear.
He could drop us off at the end here.

1:14:04.106 --> 1:14:05.650
Are you kidding?
He's coming with us.

1:14:05.733 --> 1:14:07.193
We may need a hostage.

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:09.922
Look, mate, why don't I just drop you
here, like your mate suggested, eh?

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:12.007
Then I can sign your paper
and you can be on your way.

1:14:12.031 --> 1:14:13.491
Paper?

1:14:13.574 --> 1:14:15.552
I just think it'd save us all
a lot of time, that's all.

1:14:15.576 --> 1:14:18.013
- What paper? What are you talkin' about?
- You know, for your mates.

1:14:18.037 --> 1:14:20.641
"I hereby declare I've done the
dreadful deed" and all that rubbish.

1:14:20.665 --> 1:14:22.291
I won't tell 'em I cottoned on.

1:14:22.375 --> 1:14:25.211
Listen. Just shut up
and keep driving.

1:14:25.294 --> 1:14:27.505
Oh, come on, now,
don't let's get carried away.

1:14:27.630 --> 1:14:30.192
I mean, a joke's a joke, but I keep
losing business doing this lark.

1:14:30.216 --> 1:14:32.569
Yeah, that won't be the only thing
you'll lose if you don't belt up.

1:14:32.593 --> 1:14:34.428
Look, fair's fair,
but you go too far.

1:14:34.553 --> 1:14:37.240
I'm not gonna to sign your paper,
I'm warning you, so just watch your step.

1:14:37.264 --> 1:14:39.642
- Now, see here...
- Left. Sharp left!

1:14:41.769 --> 1:14:44.438
Joe: Hang about.
What's all this, then?

1:14:44.522 --> 1:14:47.441
Man: Go right down the end
to the garage, drive right in.

1:14:47.525 --> 1:14:51.237
- Oh, I get it, I get it.
- You will if you don't belt up.

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.114
It's bleedin' Tom, innit?

1:14:53.197 --> 1:14:56.492
I mean, I told him about
the other kidnap, and he thought...

1:14:56.575 --> 1:14:58.119
Very funny!

1:15:16.470 --> 1:15:18.681
- What are you doin' here?
- You should know.

1:15:18.764 --> 1:15:22.184
What a bloody prank. Look,
it's costing me money, this game.

1:15:22.309 --> 1:15:24.520
- You know him?
- 'Course he bloody knows me.

1:15:24.645 --> 1:15:28.816
- I live here, don't I?
- Er... what happened? Where's the car?

1:15:29.025 --> 1:15:30.825
Parked on a double yellow line,
didn't he, eh?

1:15:30.901 --> 1:15:33.571
We do the job, come rushing out
with the stuff,

1:15:33.654 --> 1:15:35.740
there's our getaway car
being done for parking.

1:15:35.906 --> 1:15:37.575
Had to come back by cab.

1:15:37.658 --> 1:15:40.411
And of all the cabs in London,
you had to pick...

1:15:40.494 --> 1:15:43.789
Oh, no!

1:15:48.169 --> 1:15:49.837
I still say we can't trust him.

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:52.465
And, I'm telling you, he's a mate.
He's not gonna shop us.

1:15:52.548 --> 1:15:54.651
- I won't. I won't.
- And I say we shouldn't chance it.

1:15:54.675 --> 1:15:57.011
Look, I'm not gonna say anything.
As far as I'm concerned,

1:15:57.094 --> 1:15:58.822
itneverhappened.
I don't know nothing about it.

1:15:58.846 --> 1:16:01.098
See? Now, I'll guarantee him.
Now, don't worry.

1:16:01.182 --> 1:16:04.393
- Don't worry?
- How much do you think I'm worth?

1:16:04.477 --> 1:16:06.538
Now look, Nikki, we haven't
got time for all that, love.

1:16:06.562 --> 1:16:07.562
Take 'em off, please?

1:16:07.605 --> 1:16:09.440
I knew I'd look good
in expensive things.

1:16:09.523 --> 1:16:12.276
Yeah, you look lovely.
Now get 'em off.

1:16:12.359 --> 1:16:14.403
Right, well, er...
If you've all finished with me,

1:16:14.487 --> 1:16:15.547
I think I'd better
get back to work.

1:16:15.571 --> 1:16:17.615
Sit down.
You ain't going anywhere.

1:16:17.740 --> 1:16:19.540
- Yeah, well, I just thought...
- Well, don't.

1:16:21.994 --> 1:16:24.663
- You expecting anyone?
- It's all right. It's not the law.

1:16:26.916 --> 1:16:29.335
And I thought taxi driving
was a strain.

1:16:29.376 --> 1:16:31.170
Right, let's get this stuff
away somewhere.

1:16:31.253 --> 1:16:32.856
It's making me nervous
lying around the place.

1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:34.298
Yeah, where are you gonna put it?

1:16:34.465 --> 1:16:36.842
I know a place where
no-one'll look. Nikki?

1:16:37.009 --> 1:16:39.053
Oh, come here, monty.

1:16:42.932 --> 1:16:46.477
- Christ almighty!
- Hello, what are you doing here?

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:50.314
- You two know each other?
- Yeah, he's my brother, isn't he?

1:16:53.317 --> 1:16:55.736
Bloody hell, what's that?

1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:57.947
A hippopotamus.

1:16:58.030 --> 1:16:59.841
What the hell are you doing
mixed up in all this?

1:16:59.865 --> 1:17:01.826
Well, I'm in the big time now,
aren't I?

1:17:01.909 --> 1:17:04.286
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

1:17:04.411 --> 1:17:06.831
Peter: I was drivin'
the getaway car, wasn't I?

1:17:06.914 --> 1:17:08.749
Oh, yeah, parked on
a double yellow line.

1:17:08.874 --> 1:17:10.435
Peter: I've done it before
and never got nicked.

1:17:10.459 --> 1:17:11.836
So tell us what happened.

1:17:11.919 --> 1:17:14.088
Nothin' happened.
I got a bollockin'.

1:17:14.171 --> 1:17:16.590
You lot came running out of the shop
with the stuff.

1:17:16.674 --> 1:17:18.968
Well, the copper, he forgot about me,
so I drove off.

1:17:19.093 --> 1:17:20.886
Yeah.
We should have been with ya.

1:17:20.970 --> 1:17:23.848
Well, it looks like you managed
to pick up a cab all right, don't it?

1:17:23.931 --> 1:17:25.599
Little bleeder.
I ought to do you.

1:17:25.683 --> 1:17:29.228
I saw what happened. Didn't know
it was Joe driving it, though.

1:17:29.311 --> 1:17:30.688
How much did he charge ya?

1:17:30.813 --> 1:17:32.940
You think you're very funny,
don't you, eh?

1:17:33.065 --> 1:17:34.233
Come on, Harry, lay off.

1:17:34.316 --> 1:17:36.002
Yeah, but how do we know
he wasn't followed?

1:17:36.026 --> 1:17:37.695
Bloody amateur,
coming straight back here.

1:17:37.820 --> 1:17:40.781
So what else was I supposed to do?
It wasn't me they were following.

1:17:40.906 --> 1:17:42.968
Yeah, well, any more cheek
and I'll lay one on you so hard

1:17:42.992 --> 1:17:44.511
my fist'll come out
the back of your head.

1:17:44.535 --> 1:17:45.661
Take it easy, Harry, yeah?

1:17:45.786 --> 1:17:48.414
The kid didn't mean nothing.
Just let it rest, okay?

1:17:48.497 --> 1:17:51.125
Yeah, trouble is, my friends,
what do we do now?

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:54.170
I mean, for all we know,
they might have taken Joe's number.

1:17:54.253 --> 1:17:56.690
For all we know, they might be
on the way round here right now.

1:17:56.714 --> 1:17:58.215
Taken my number?

1:17:58.299 --> 1:18:00.634
Oh, that's great, that is.
That's really landed me in it.

1:18:00.718 --> 1:18:02.696
Tom's right. We ought to split
before they get on to us.

1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:04.847
Yeah, we'll meet up tomorrow
like we planned.

1:18:06.348 --> 1:18:08.642
Too late, they're here.

1:18:10.311 --> 1:18:12.938
- Can't see anyone.
- Well, it's not ringing on its own.

1:18:13.063 --> 1:18:14.398
Who is it?

1:18:14.481 --> 1:18:18.235
Nikki: If nobody makes a sound,
perhaps they'll go away.

1:18:18.319 --> 1:18:21.071
Look, maybe you'd better go
and see who it is.

1:18:21.155 --> 1:18:23.157
- What?
- Do you want me to go?

1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:26.452
You stay right where you are.
Yeah. Go on.

1:18:29.079 --> 1:18:31.957
Carol: It's no use hiding.
I know you're in there, Joe north.

1:18:32.041 --> 1:18:34.084
Bloody hell, that's all I need.

1:18:34.168 --> 1:18:36.837
Answer this door
or I'll scream the place down.

1:18:36.921 --> 1:18:38.839
You let me in or,
I'm warning you,

1:18:38.923 --> 1:18:41.467
I'll get the police
to knock the door in.

1:18:42.051 --> 1:18:45.971
- Oh, Carol.
- You took your time, didn't ya?

1:18:46.055 --> 1:18:48.224
- Where is he?
- Who?

1:18:48.307 --> 1:18:50.434
Oh, Joe.

1:18:50.517 --> 1:18:53.229
Who did you think I meant?
Mickey mouse?

1:18:53.479 --> 1:18:55.940
He's out. Working.

1:18:56.065 --> 1:18:57.983
What? When his taxi's here?

1:18:58.192 --> 1:19:00.319
What's he driving?
Horse and cart?

1:19:00.444 --> 1:19:03.781
His taxi's not here.
He's out in it.

1:19:03.906 --> 1:19:07.576
Really. Well, I have just bumped into
the tall lady from number 3,

1:19:07.701 --> 1:19:10.079
with the toy poodle
and the blue rinse.

1:19:10.162 --> 1:19:11.830
And, according to her,

1:19:11.914 --> 1:19:15.292
Joe's taxi drove into
your garage ten minutes ago.

1:19:15.376 --> 1:19:19.964
So, unless it's gone straight through
your back wall, it's still here, innit?

1:19:20.506 --> 1:19:23.300
Well, you see, I wouldn't
know about that, 'cause, er...

1:19:23.425 --> 1:19:24.635
I was asleep.

1:19:26.971 --> 1:19:28.806
He's up there, isn't he?

1:19:28.889 --> 1:19:31.100
He's up there with
another bloody bird!

1:19:31.225 --> 1:19:32.393
Oh!

1:19:32.935 --> 1:19:35.145
Joe, get rid of her.

1:19:35.229 --> 1:19:37.207
- What am I supposed to do?
- Carol: Joe north, I'm coming up,

1:19:37.231 --> 1:19:40.526
and if I find you in a compromising
position with your knickers down, I'll...

1:19:43.946 --> 1:19:47.574
- Didn't know you had company.
- Hello, Carol.

1:19:47.658 --> 1:19:50.869
I just came to tell you
that I've forgiven you.

1:19:51.036 --> 1:19:53.080
For what you was doing
last time I saw you.

1:19:53.163 --> 1:19:55.416
- Oh, er... thank you.
- Yes.

1:19:55.541 --> 1:19:59.545
I've thought it over very carefully
and I decided that what you did

1:19:59.628 --> 1:20:02.172
was a moment of weakness
on your behalf,

1:20:02.256 --> 1:20:04.258
so I have forgiven you.

1:20:04.341 --> 1:20:06.510
- Great.
- I thought you'd be pleased.

1:20:06.593 --> 1:20:08.595
Yeah. Great.

1:20:08.679 --> 1:20:11.849
Well, aren't you
going to introduce me?

1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:14.852
To your friends?

1:20:14.935 --> 1:20:17.646
Oh. Yes, um... this is Peter.

1:20:17.730 --> 1:20:20.899
Yes, I know Peter, and Tom,
and that Nikki as well.

1:20:21.025 --> 1:20:24.153
And, um... this is, er...
Jeremy?

1:20:24.236 --> 1:20:25.529
Terribly pleased to meet you.

1:20:25.612 --> 1:20:28.574
- And Rupert.
- Very pleased to meet you.

1:20:28.741 --> 1:20:31.368
I'm Joe's fiancée.
Carol hotchkiss.

1:20:31.452 --> 1:20:34.955
Actually, Harry... Bernard and Jim
were just about to leave.

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:36.915
Er... yeah, yeah.

1:20:36.999 --> 1:20:38.709
- Yeah, we're going.
- Yeah.

1:20:38.834 --> 1:20:40.210
Yeah.

1:20:40.294 --> 1:20:41.962
- Yeah.
- Bye, Rupert.

1:20:42.046 --> 1:20:44.548
Nice to have met you.

1:20:45.966 --> 1:20:47.402
What did you say
they do for a living?

1:20:47.426 --> 1:20:48.510
- Insurance.
- Antiques.

1:20:48.594 --> 1:20:49.970
- Banking.
- Computers.

1:20:52.890 --> 1:20:54.475
What's goin' on?

1:20:54.558 --> 1:20:56.935
What do you mean? Nothing. Why?

1:20:57.853 --> 1:21:01.106
Is there something
I'm not supposed to know about?

1:21:01.231 --> 1:21:04.360
It's just that I get the impression...

1:21:04.443 --> 1:21:06.362
I mean, what's he
doing here for a start?

1:21:06.445 --> 1:21:08.530
Peter: Just come to see
my brother, haven't I?

1:21:10.616 --> 1:21:12.409
You've got someone here,
haven't you?

1:21:12.493 --> 1:21:16.205
Another woman.
Another naked tart in the bedroom.

1:21:16.288 --> 1:21:18.916
Oh, for god's sake. Look, there's
no-one here but us, that's all.

1:21:18.999 --> 1:21:21.811
- How am I supposed to know that?
- Well, you've just got a suspicious mind.

1:21:21.835 --> 1:21:24.713
That's your trouble. You're worse
than the CIA, into everything.

1:21:24.797 --> 1:21:27.007
If I caught you with
another woman, Joe north,

1:21:27.091 --> 1:21:28.842
so help me,
I would kill you, I would.

1:21:28.926 --> 1:21:32.763
Especially after I've forgiven you
for your misdemeanour.

1:21:32.846 --> 1:21:36.100
Listen, darlin', you know you're
the only girl in the world for me.

1:21:36.225 --> 1:21:39.186
It's just that, um...
I've learned my lesson.

1:21:39.269 --> 1:21:41.647
Come on, let's go down the pub
and have a drink, eh?

1:21:41.772 --> 1:21:44.900
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes, I'm thirsty. I could do with one.

1:21:45.067 --> 1:21:47.861
No. About me being
the only girl in the world.

1:21:47.986 --> 1:21:49.738
'Course I do. Come on.

1:21:49.863 --> 1:21:53.075
Oh, well, don't push me, all right?
I mean, the pubs aren't even open yet.

1:21:53.158 --> 1:21:55.238
- So? We can wait.
- Which one did you want to go to?

1:21:55.285 --> 1:21:56.995
Oh, any one...

1:21:59.665 --> 1:22:01.375
Thank god for that.

1:22:03.585 --> 1:22:08.424
Good day, sir. Madam.
Going somewhere, were we?

1:22:08.507 --> 1:22:11.593
- Who are you?
- Do you mind if we step inside, sir?

1:22:11.677 --> 1:22:14.721
- Carol: What did you want?
- If you don't mind, sir?

1:22:19.226 --> 1:22:21.395
Carol: No, you see,
we were just on our way out.

1:22:21.478 --> 1:22:22.479
Yes, I had noticed.

1:22:22.604 --> 1:22:25.065
Yes, we were waiting
till the pubs opened.

1:22:25.774 --> 1:22:28.527
Inspector Rogers, cid.

1:22:28.610 --> 1:22:31.655
- And this is sergeant jeeves.
- Afternoon, all.

1:22:31.697 --> 1:22:35.075
I rather thought you might be able
to help us with our enquiries.

1:22:35.159 --> 1:22:37.995
Oh, what's been happening?

1:22:38.620 --> 1:22:40.581
Oi! You got a search warrant?

1:22:40.706 --> 1:22:43.250
Why? You hiding something?

1:22:44.376 --> 1:22:48.881
You were with him.
And you were with him.

1:22:48.964 --> 1:22:50.507
Right?

1:22:51.925 --> 1:22:54.219
So, who were you with?

1:22:54.344 --> 1:22:55.679
Myself.

1:22:55.762 --> 1:22:57.639
Joe, what's this all about?

1:22:57.723 --> 1:23:00.100
You're a bit young to be
in this sort of league, aren't you?

1:23:00.267 --> 1:23:01.768
I didn't know
there was an age limit.

1:23:01.852 --> 1:23:04.313
Look, what are we supposed
to be helping his enquiries with?

1:23:04.438 --> 1:23:05.939
Carol, love.

1:23:06.064 --> 1:23:08.692
It's to do with sex, isn't it?

1:23:08.775 --> 1:23:10.503
You've been having orgies up here,
haven't you?

1:23:10.527 --> 1:23:11.653
That's what it is, isn't it?

1:23:11.737 --> 1:23:13.655
- Orgies.
- Rogers: No, ma'am.

1:23:13.780 --> 1:23:15.365
Well, it must be something like that.

1:23:15.449 --> 1:23:17.993
I mean, if Joe's anything to do
with it, it must be sexy.

1:23:18.076 --> 1:23:20.078
You've got a one-track mind, you have.

1:23:20.162 --> 1:23:22.372
All right, if it's not orgies,
what is it, then?

1:23:22.456 --> 1:23:25.375
You might say
it's a little treasure hunt.

1:23:26.043 --> 1:23:28.212
Joe, what have you got yourself
mixed up with now?

1:23:28.295 --> 1:23:30.005
- Nothing.
- I bet you have.

1:23:30.088 --> 1:23:32.716
Especially if
there's a woman involved.

1:23:32.799 --> 1:23:36.470
- Listen, there's nothing up here.
- Not according to your two friends.

1:23:36.553 --> 1:23:37.930
We've got 'em outside.

1:23:38.013 --> 1:23:40.432
- Picked 'em up a few minutes ago.
- What two friends?

1:23:40.516 --> 1:23:43.894
We know all about your little caper
at the jewellers.

1:23:43.936 --> 1:23:46.271
I'm sorry, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

1:23:46.355 --> 1:23:49.858
Why don't you just come clean?
Your friends have.

1:23:51.443 --> 1:23:53.237
Found any little trinkets yet?

1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:54.363
Not yet, sir.

1:23:54.488 --> 1:23:56.288
Tom: You're not gonna
find anything, you know.

1:23:56.323 --> 1:23:59.535
We'll see. Life's full of
little surprises, isn't it?

1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:01.078
Jesus Christ!

1:24:01.161 --> 1:24:02.514
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't mean to shout.

1:24:02.538 --> 1:24:04.248
It's just there's
a bloody snake in there.

1:24:04.331 --> 1:24:06.208
That is monty.

1:24:06.291 --> 1:24:09.336
He is my speciality and
he's very highly strung.

1:24:09.419 --> 1:24:12.756
Please don't upset him.
He's got a performance tonight.

1:24:12.839 --> 1:24:15.300
- There's nothing there, sir.
- Told ya.

1:24:15.425 --> 1:24:20.180
Here, I've just realised.
You're looking for stolen property.

1:24:20.305 --> 1:24:22.432
Carol, why don't you belt up?

1:24:22.516 --> 1:24:24.643
But the cheek of it.
I mean, comin' in here

1:24:24.726 --> 1:24:26.704
and searching this place
like we were all criminals.

1:24:26.728 --> 1:24:29.147
No, you tell him, Joe.
Go on, tell him.

1:24:29.231 --> 1:24:31.441
Carol, Carol,
will you shut up, Carol?

1:24:31.525 --> 1:24:32.985
Go on. Go on, tell him.

1:24:33.110 --> 1:24:36.321
Ask to see his search warrant.
Go on. Ask. Ask.

1:24:36.405 --> 1:24:37.906
Go on. Go on.

1:24:37.990 --> 1:24:40.117
If you don't ask,
I shall never speak to you again,

1:24:40.242 --> 1:24:42.953
even though I have forgiven you.

1:24:43.996 --> 1:24:45.789
Have you got something to say, then?

1:24:45.872 --> 1:24:48.417
- Well, um, inspector...
- Go on, go on, tell him to get out.

1:24:48.584 --> 1:24:49.668
Yes, um...

1:24:49.793 --> 1:24:52.379
And tell him to apologise.
Tell him you know your rights.

1:24:52.504 --> 1:24:55.340
Tell him you'll sue him for libel
if he don't apologise.

1:24:55.465 --> 1:24:56.717
She'll get me jailed for life.

1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:00.012
Well, go on, Joe, tell him.
Joe is my fiancé.

1:25:00.095 --> 1:25:03.390
Well, um, inspector, as you
don't appear to have found anything...

1:25:03.515 --> 1:25:05.475
That's right.
Really lay it on him.

1:25:05.559 --> 1:25:08.395
I suggest we, um, call it a day.

1:25:08.562 --> 1:25:11.356
- Don't you?
- That's a bit pathetic, innit?

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:13.483
- Carol!
- Well, I mean, he's just called us

1:25:13.567 --> 1:25:15.485
a bunch of criminals.
We could sue him for that.

1:25:15.569 --> 1:25:19.156
Excuse me, ma'am,
I haven't called any of you criminals.

1:25:20.157 --> 1:25:21.366
Yet.

1:25:21.450 --> 1:25:22.760
Carol: Oh, yes, you did.
I heard you.

1:25:22.784 --> 1:25:24.786
You said we had stolen goods.

1:25:24.870 --> 1:25:26.455
What sort of people
do you think we are?

1:25:26.538 --> 1:25:28.081
Accusing us of being criminals.

1:25:28.165 --> 1:25:29.934
- We are respectable, we are.
- Nikki!

1:25:29.958 --> 1:25:32.461
Carol: I have never done
anything criminal in my life.

1:25:32.586 --> 1:25:34.755
- I work in a supermarket.
- Nikki!

1:25:34.838 --> 1:25:36.882
And as for Joe,
well, he's a taxi driver.

1:25:36.965 --> 1:25:39.676
And Peter is, well...

1:25:39.801 --> 1:25:43.430
And as for Tom, well, you could hardly
call him a criminal. He's a mechanic.

1:25:43.513 --> 1:25:44.765
- Nikki...
- And Nikki,

1:25:44.890 --> 1:25:47.100
- well, she's respectable. She's a stripper.
- Nikki!

1:25:47.225 --> 1:25:49.561
And so the last thing you could
ever find in this place

1:25:49.645 --> 1:25:51.647
would be stolen property.

1:26:35.315 --> 1:26:37.567
Just been visiting Tom.
Poor bastard.

1:26:37.651 --> 1:26:39.695
Got five years.
Him and his mates.

1:26:39.736 --> 1:26:41.863
I thought I was gonna
go down meself at one point.

1:26:41.947 --> 1:26:45.075
But, as I explained to them,
I was a victim of the circumstances.

1:26:45.158 --> 1:26:46.827
And they let me off with a caution.

1:26:46.910 --> 1:26:48.888
Mind you, I think they were
glad to see the back of me,

1:26:48.912 --> 1:26:51.540
'cause Carol was pestering
the life out of them.

1:26:51.665 --> 1:26:53.291
Nikki got out of it all right.

1:26:53.375 --> 1:26:55.252
Probation. First offence.

1:26:55.335 --> 1:26:57.337
Tom's asked me
to keep an eye on her for him.

1:26:57.421 --> 1:27:00.090
That's a favour
I shan't mind doing.

1:27:00.173 --> 1:27:02.843
Lost me a lot of time, though,
all this business with the law.

1:27:02.926 --> 1:27:06.847
Lost me a place to live and all.
Guess where I've ended up?

1:27:07.264 --> 1:27:09.474
Mrs north: Nothing like
home cookin', is there?

1:27:09.558 --> 1:27:11.768
Not like your home cooking,
there isn't.

1:27:11.852 --> 1:27:14.563
Carol rang up.
Said she'd be round at six.

1:27:14.646 --> 1:27:16.857
- You were taking her out.
- Oh, yeah.

1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:18.859
That's really lumbered me
in it, that has.

1:27:18.984 --> 1:27:21.087
I suppose the only good thing
that's come out of this is you

1:27:21.111 --> 1:27:22.362
getting off on probation.

1:27:22.446 --> 1:27:24.206
Really shook you up,
that brush with the law.

1:27:24.239 --> 1:27:27.451
