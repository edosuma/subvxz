WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:04.300
Scotty, are you a client?
- Well, I think I'm far more than witness.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.200
But all he ever wants to talk about is the case.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.500
You were the one who virtually refused to be in my life

00:08.500 --> 00:10.400
for three years, and I don't know what it's about.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.800
Alcohol's my gateway to pills.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.000
The problem is people are my gateway to alcohol.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.200
I think you should move in, too.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.600
Kidding!
- Oh! God!

00:18.600 --> 00:20.500
Well, they all think that I don't know that

00:20.500 --> 00:23.699
my husband had an affair with that woman Holly over there,

00:23.700 --> 00:27.700
with a cunning little cottage built for two to go with it.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.300
What on Earth would possess her to put up this picture?

00:31.500 --> 00:33.500
Maybe Kitty won't notice.
- What?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.600
Tommy, Look at it. How could she not notice?

00:35.600 --> 00:37.500
She's the only one not in the picture, Tommy.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.500
She's going to notice.
- Why wasn't she there that day?

00:39.500 --> 00:40.900
Oh, she couldn't get away from New York.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.800
She had that speech about women and power.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.600
Oh, please. The speech had nothing to do with it.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.400
It was the Kitty-Mommy Cold War back then.
- Oh, yeah.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.299
This is just one of the little aftereffects.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.200
I looked so good that day.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.800
That guy had stopped cutting my hair.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.899
Mom and Dad look so happy.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.900
Yo, Julia is a babe.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.799
Mommy, save me!
- Slow down!

01:04.800 --> 01:07.799
I'm so gonna kill you, Dude.
- Gabe, please don't chase your little brother.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.800
But he spit in my mouth.
- I don't care. Slow down, Gabe.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.000
Wow, Sarah. Tough stepmom..

01:13.000 --> 01:13.999
Mommy, help me!

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, God.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.200
They're just too young to appreciate the pleasures

01:20.500 --> 01:24.500
of spitting in someone's mouth.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.200
You'd know --
- Wh--??

01:27.200 --> 01:30.300
See, Paige, we're about 60% water.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.700
So you want to stay hydrated.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.900
Joe, could you please give me a hand with Cooper?

01:34.900 --> 01:36.400
He's going crazy. He's gonna break something.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.900
He's outside. Gabe's got it under control.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.900
Come on, Sarah. I just have him for a week.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.600
What's up, Little Chicken?

01:45.600 --> 01:46.700
I got thirsty.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.399
She overdid it playing with the guys.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.700
Yeah, well, they can be very trying, can't they

01:50.900 --> 01:54.900
when they've got it all under control?

02:00.400 --> 02:02.100
You don't think that's a good spot for it?

02:02.100 --> 02:04.899
There is no good spot for it, Mom. Kitty's not in it.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.900
Well, she's not gonna care. She was in New York.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.699
She was probably busy that weekend.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.600
It's a really good picture.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.500
I'm back.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.400
Oh, God. Hi.

02:14.400 --> 02:14.900
Hi.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.100
God, I hate that market.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.500
It looks like everybody just came...

02:18.500 --> 02:22.500
from hair and makeup.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.100
What's wrong?

02:24.100 --> 02:28.100
Nothing.
- Nothing.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.400
Justin!

02:30.400 --> 02:34.400
There's groceries in the car. The ice cream will melt.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.500
(whispers) Big problem.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.600
Hey, you want a scotch?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.100
No, I need to talk to you.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.400
Yeah, I can listen while pouring.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.200
You can barely listen while hearing.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.700
Hey.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.200
I got a job for you.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.100
Who are you, Dad now?
- My friend's the manager

03:01.100 --> 03:02.600
of the Sunset Holloway Grand Downtown.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.400
There's a bellman job available.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.100
What, the guys at the door? They're hustlers.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.200
You know how some peple run out of chances in life

03:08.200 --> 03:11.900
and you can smell it on 'em?
- Oh, you are Dad now. At least we know.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.900
Just take the job.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.500
Oh, you know who I saw at the market?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.300
I saw that woman, that crazy woman --

03:22.300 --> 03:24.100
What was her name -- Sloane Donaldson?

03:24.100 --> 03:25.800
Oh, that loud golf lady?

03:25.800 --> 03:28.000
I have been dodging her call for a month.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.300
Oh, yeah. She is, like, desperate for you to respond

03:30.300 --> 03:31.600
to some golf invite.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.100
Yes.
(gasps) Not that dreadful

03:33.100 --> 03:34.600
husband-and-wife golf tournament?
- Yes.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.200
Oh, it's such a pageant.
- Yes, yes.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.200
They want me to go because they want to honor your father.
- For his golf game?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.400
No, not for his golf game.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.400
For the man who he apparently was,

03:44.400 --> 03:47.200
But I don't have anybody to play with.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.800
Oh. Kevin plays.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.200
What? N-no, Kevin doesn't.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.400
Yes, Kevin does play.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.600
He played on the high school golf team.
- That's right.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.399
Yeah, only cause I had a crush on Matthew Brown.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.699
What? N-no. Kevin doesn't.

03:59.700 --> 04:00.699
Yes, Kevin does play.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.099
He played on the high school golf team.
- That's right.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.499
Yeah, only cause I had a crush on Matthew Brown.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.500
I joined everything he joined, even Future Farmers of America.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.200
Yeah, he grew a prize-winning pumpkin.
- Oh, I bet he did.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.000
Look, missing it is not the worst thing in the world.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
That Donaldson woman is so boozy, and her husband cheats.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.500
At golf, at golf.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.000
It's probably better just to let it go.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.400
I'm letting it go.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.700
I totally agree. Gone.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.900
But, Dad is being honored, Kevin.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.100
You know, I'm not gonna ask your brother to go there.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.700
He hates that place.
- Yeah. They're all such homophobes.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.200
I did read in the club bulletin,

04:39.200 --> 04:40.900
They're starting a Thursday league for Lesbians.

04:40.900 --> 04:44.200
and I thought that was...
- Wow. Am I the only one that finds that

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200
somehow more troubling?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.100
You know what, Kevin? You're Mom's lawyer.

04:47.100 --> 04:50.500
She's your client. They're honoring Dad. You have to play.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.199
Yeah, you have to play, Kevin.
- Hi, everybody.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.599
Hi. I have a Volnay and a Cote de Rhone.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.400
Whoo!
- How about that? That's pretty good.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.700
Crack it open.
- Uncle Saul, you play golf, right?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.000
Golf? I hate golf. Tennis -- I'm there.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.200
All right. I'm not going. It's settled.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.500
Good. I totally agree. Settled.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.900
Sister, we have work to do in there.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.000
Gotta sign some papers, Julia.

05:11.000 --> 05:11.900
Sure.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.000
Are you really gonna let her forego this?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Kitty, first of all, I have

05:15.000 --> 05:17.300
a tentative date set for that day, OK?
- Oh, you do not.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.500
Yes, I do.
- You do? You do? Who with?

05:19.500 --> 05:22.100
What?
- Who with? Come on.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.100
Look --
- Come on.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.700
Look, in light of recent tragic events,

05:24.700 --> 05:26.500
I don't think Mom should be expected to turn up

05:26.500 --> 05:29.400
at the Sierra Vista Country Club and pay homage to a man

05:29.400 --> 05:32.800
that lied to her for 30 years.
- But she just said that she wanted to go.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.000
No, she didn't, and she also said I don't have to.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah, that's her way of asking, dumb-ass.

05:39.700 --> 05:40.600
Paige.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.600
Oh boy. I can see it now.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.600
Ooh, ooh, yeah.

05:52.200 --> 05:56.100
Is that me playing golf or having sex?

05:56.300 --> 05:57.300
All right.

05:57.300 --> 06:00.400
So, the house we paid for is now Holly's?

06:00.400 --> 06:02.100
Once you finish signing.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.500
If I were her, I would sell it

06:03.500 --> 06:06.700
and move somewhere cheap and sleazy.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.100
Preferably on the other side of the world.

06:09.100 --> 06:12.300
She is not a terrible person, Nora.

06:12.300 --> 06:15.400
What are you saying?

06:15.400 --> 06:18.000
Let me tell you something, Saul, my darling,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.500
I have managed to get through my entire lifetime

06:20.500 --> 06:22.600
without ever touching anyone else's husband.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.800
It's not that hard to do.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.000
I see, and that's the only sin, adultery, huh?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.500
That's the only thing that matters?

06:27.500 --> 06:29.800
She's an entire human being, Nora.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.400
There's more to her than this one mistake she made.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.400
I can't stand you defending that woman.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.400
The only woman I'm defending is you.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.300
From whom?

06:38.300 --> 06:41.800
Yourself and your own self-righteousness.

06:41.800 --> 06:45.000
Life is lonely, Nora. It's long and lonely,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.300
and there are so many genuine evils in this world.

06:47.300 --> 06:47.900
I would think

06:47.900 --> 06:49.700
that you would at least let someone off the hook

06:49.700 --> 06:53.700
for falling in love with the wrong person.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.200
If I don't give that wine some air,

06:57.200 --> 06:58.300
it won't be worth drinking.

06:58.300 --> 07:02.300
So, if you'll excuse me...

07:04.100 --> 07:04.700
Hello.

07:04.700 --> 07:08.100
Hi. Am I interrupting something?

07:08.100 --> 07:11.000
Kind of. I'm on a date.
- Oh, okay.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Um, well, I'll call you later.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.400
No. Wait, wait, Kitty.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.700
It's a terrible date.

07:17.700 --> 07:18.500
I'm glad you called.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.300
I was praying for a reason to leave the table.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.600
Well, here I am.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.800
So what's the skinny?

07:24.800 --> 07:27.300
Well, you went back to New York two weeks ago,

07:27.300 --> 07:29.800
and I'm missing you badly.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.000
Am I allowed to say that even though I cheated on you

07:32.000 --> 07:35.100
and I made the biggest mistake of my life?

07:35.100 --> 07:37.700
I guess so.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.000
You know how sorry I am about --

07:40.000 --> 07:41.500
No more apologies.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.500
All right. Well, don't sleep with her.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.900
You can't ask me to do that.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.400
Can we talk next week?

07:49.400 --> 07:50.900
Whenever you want.

07:50.900 --> 07:51.500
Bye.

07:51.500 --> 07:55.500
Bye.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.200
Hey.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.200
Hey.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.100
Cooper down?

07:59.100 --> 08:00.400
Oh, no. Paige.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.500
Uh, she stayed up way too late last night.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.800
I don't know how you guys do it --

08:04.800 --> 08:08.600
Two kids, all day, everyday. Gabe on the weekends.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.300
Well, most of the time, I'm grateful for it.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.400
You know, I do better when I'm busy.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.100
But, uh, Sarah --
- Oh, please. She's my sister.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.800
Mm-hmm. She's busy with work. We don't see each other much

08:19.800 --> 08:23.000
and, um, and I just -- I get the feeling...

08:23.000 --> 08:25.500
What?

08:25.500 --> 08:29.500
Uh, that there's something that she's not telling me.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.600
Oh, well, you know, Sarah's like that.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.400
She alwasy retreats into her work.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.500
She's just like our dad that way.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.500
But, well, she's not like our Dad in the other way...

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
In case you're wondering.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
I'm sure it's just a busy time.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.800
It'll get better.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.000
Yeah, I'm sure.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.100
Did you tell him about the job?

08:49.100 --> 08:52.000
Yes, he told me about the golden career opportunity.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.200
Holding the door for geezers and whores.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.000
Speaking of which, golf tournament -- You taking Mom?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.300
Why is it always me? Why don't you take her?

08:58.300 --> 09:02.300
Hey, what's the powwow about?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.200
Oh, wow. I--

09:08.200 --> 09:11.700
I guess I didn't notice that.

09:11.700 --> 09:15.700
When was that taken?

09:15.800 --> 09:17.300
A while ago.
- Dinner's ready.

09:17.300 --> 09:21.300
Oh, uh, dinner.
- Yeah.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.899
Gabe. Come on, Gabe. We're sitting down.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.800
Okay, little man, you're over here with Mommy.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.900
It's your favorite -- chicken.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.900
Yay!

09:41.100 --> 09:41.700
Mom.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.300
Yeah?

09:43.300 --> 09:46.900
Why did you hang up that picture?

09:46.900 --> 09:50.900
I'm not in it.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.000
It's a beautiful picture, Kitty.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.900
It was a beautiful day. 
- I wasn't there.

09:55.900 --> 09:59.900
Kitty, you weren't there for a lot of things.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.600
Come on, everybody. Let's sit.

10:10.200 --> 10:14.999
<font color="#ffff00">J&J Subtitles: jeralvsut@hotmail.com</font>

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Oh, it's you.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.100
Yeah, I thought I'd stop by.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.900
I'm shocked and awed. Come in.

10:20.900 --> 10:24.500
Canneles.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.700
Can-what?

10:25.700 --> 10:27.000
Your feelings aside,

10:27.000 --> 10:28.800
I just don't get why she would hang it.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.400
The picture? I don't know.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.300
So what is this impromptu visit about?

10:32.300 --> 10:35.300
Sarah, I just wanna be here more,

10:35.300 --> 10:36.600
and I finally get to.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.000
After all these years,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.600
I finally get to be Cool Aunt Kitty.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.800
Hey, Cooper.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.000
Yay! Guess who's here. Look.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.700
Hi, Aunt Kitty.
- Mm-hmm.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.100
Does Paigey like canneles?

10:48.100 --> 10:51.399
I don't think <i>Paige</i> has ever had canneles.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.200
Neither has her mother, for that matter.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.900
I used to have them every Sunday.

10:54.900 --> 10:57.500
At Cafe Lalo in New York.
- Mmm.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.000
And then I would have the frozen berries.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.500
Why didn't I trade lives with you when I had the chance?
- Sarah, I know,

11:02.500 --> 11:04.800
Diana Vakili was very good with a ouija board,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.400
but I don't think she really had the power

11:06.400 --> 11:07.500
to make us trade lives.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.600
You might be right, but she was tied into something, though.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.100
She was a very powerful girl.

11:13.100 --> 11:16.000
Cooper, this one's for you.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.900
I hate those. I want a toastie treat.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.400
(groans) I promised him a toastie treat

11:20.400 --> 11:22.000
if he ate something real.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.700
That's OK. I love children and their impulses.

11:24.700 --> 11:25.700
Where's Paigey?

11:25.700 --> 11:26.699
<i>Paige</i> is still in bed.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.800
Joe's getting her up, Cool Aunt Kitty.

11:29.300 --> 11:32.900
You know, if you guys ever need a babysitter...
- Do you know a good one?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.400
Me.
(scoffs)

11:34.400 --> 11:37.200
Seriously. If you ever need a night out...

11:37.200 --> 11:39.900
No. Our kids are Democrats.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.300
I know that.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.100
You know, if I ever get a life,

11:43.100 --> 11:44.200
I might take you up on that.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.900
Could you watch him for a sec?
- Of course.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.600
That's the whole point.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.000
Joe, is Paige up? I have to get going.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.500
Come on, Cooper, give it a try.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.200
Cooper, please, no. Come on.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.900
These are really expensive.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.300
<i>Eat.</i>

12:00.300 --> 12:02.400
(Nora) I honestly don't see what the big deal is,

12:02.400 --> 12:04.599
but if it's so offensive to her, I'll take it down.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.100
Well, you're not taking it down, are you? I am.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.600
I find it extraordinary

12:08.900 --> 12:10.900
you put it up in the first place.

12:10.900 --> 12:14.100
(gasps) Oh, look what's playing at the El Portal Theatre.
- "Psycho"?

12:14.100 --> 12:17.600
"Two For the Road." You ever seen it?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.000
Albert Finney, Audrey Hepburn --

12:20.000 --> 12:22.900
Oh...it's so like

12:22.900 --> 12:24.700
your father and me and our trips.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.300
They go through this tunnel and come out,

12:26.300 --> 12:30.300
and the years have gone by.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.800
Mom, about the golf tournament...

12:34.800 --> 12:35.800
Yes, what?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.900
You're not upset we're not going, are you?

12:37.900 --> 12:41.100
<i>No.</i> That dreadful thing? I called and cancelled.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.300
Really? Good.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.400
Well, then I'll firm up my plans for tomorrow.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.900
Now a toast to your father.

12:45.900 --> 12:49.900
It's a little sad to miss that, but it's all right.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.700
We should go.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.500
Kevin, no. No, you don't want to go.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.900
You call, firm up your plans.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.500
No. The toast to Dad -- Let's do it.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.500
Really?
- Yeah, really.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.100
Really?

13:02.100 --> 13:04.100
Yes, really.

13:04.100 --> 13:07.100
All right, I'll -- I'll call and un-cancel.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.000
Kev, you are such a doll.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Oh. Okay, we're going.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:22.500 --> 13:25.000
Whoa. Good thing I had my pants on.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.799
Yeah, otherwise I might have totally lost control.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.500
I, uh, I'm Justin. It's my first day.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.900
I never would've guessed.
- Uh, so what's the deal

13:33.900 --> 13:35.600
with this dude Tyler I'm supposed to talk to?

13:35.600 --> 13:37.900
Is he cool or a total hard-ass?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.700
Total hard-ass.

13:39.700 --> 13:43.100
Great. Can he tell if you're stoned?

13:43.100 --> 13:45.400
(chuckles) I think you just told her.

13:45.400 --> 13:49.400
Keep your pants on out there, Stonehenge.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.500
Oh. Oh.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.800
(Kitty) All I'm saying is I want to know

13:55.800 --> 13:57.000
who's gonna break the stalemate.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.500
Me, because we've run out of time.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.100
For all of us here at "Red, White & Blue,"

14:01.100 --> 14:02.500
I'm Jack Bishop.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.900
Thanks and good-night.

14:04.900 --> 14:05.700
(man) And we're out.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.600
All right. Does anyone want to get a drink?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.600
Uh, no, thanks.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.600
No, thanks.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.900
(Whit) Hey, Guys, hold up.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.800
I just got a call.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.000
David Silver is leaving the Democratic Party

14:22.000 --> 14:24.100
and running for president as an Independent.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.200
He wants to announce his candidacy on Wednesday's show.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.800
That's amazing.
- It is, but there's a catch.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.400
He doesn't want to be tag-teamed.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.200
He wants a straight half-hour with one of you two. 
- I'm the one who's gonna be the most confrontational.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.000
Well, that's not true. 
- I've been on the show longer.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.900
I did an hour with Jim Jeffords in 2001

14:37.900 --> 14:39.100
when he left the Republican Party.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.600
I know these issues up and down.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.700
I just want to have a chance to do what I do --

14:42.700 --> 14:45.900
do my thing -- on this show, without him yelling at me.
- OK, we'll flip for it.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.100
Oh, no.
- It's fair and square. Heads or tails?

14:48.100 --> 14:51.300
No, I am not going to let my participation be determined

14:51.300 --> 14:55.300
by a random and childish act like flipping a coin. Tails!

14:56.800 --> 14:57.500
Heads.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.600
Huh.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.100
Fine.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.500
But can you just ask him one thing for me?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.200
OK, just ask him how he's gonna make sure

15:07.200 --> 15:07.800
that his candidacy

15:07.800 --> 15:09.600
doesn't devolve into a cult of personality

15:09.600 --> 15:13.200
because lack of affiliation with a party is great on paper,

15:13.200 --> 15:14.700
but I'm no believer

15:14.700 --> 15:16.400
in the Great Man's school of history.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.500
So, I just want to know, not as a pundit,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.100
but as a voter, as an American,

15:20.100 --> 15:22.200
I want to know who he has ready to hold him accountable

15:22.200 --> 15:24.200
when his status as a maverick is just

15:24.200 --> 15:28.200
a little more attractive to him than his logical consistency.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.800
Tails.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.000
Hmm. Yeah, that's OK.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.900
I will, uh, I'll yell from home.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.100
All right, it's less than 48 hours away.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.500
You want some research assistants put on this?

15:38.500 --> 15:41.000
No. No. That's OK. I can handle it.
- Here.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
What is this?
- His policy manifesto. 500 pages plus.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.600
OK.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.700
Looks like I'm gonna pull an all-nighter.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.700
See ya.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.400
Hey, Sarah.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.900
Hey, got a second?

15:58.900 --> 16:00.400
Uh, yeah. What's up?

16:00.400 --> 16:02.800
I want to take you up on your offer

16:02.800 --> 16:04.200
to sit the kids.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.000
Oh. Yeah.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.800
Joe had a music lesson cancelled tomorrow night,

16:07.800 --> 16:11.500
so I made reservations at Pastis.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.900
Perfect.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.500
I'd love to babysit.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.500
Tomorrow night's okay? You're not too busy?

16:16.500 --> 16:18.800
Oh, no. It's fine.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.100
I'm not busy at all.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.900
Okay. Hey, I gotta run.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.300
Okay. See ya.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.200
Hey, Sis.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.200
Yeah?

16:26.200 --> 16:28.500
Thanks for this.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.300
Sure. Bye.

16:30.300 --> 16:34.300
Bye.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.600
Oh, man.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.000
(Paige) Out of the way. I can't see.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.700
I can't see while you're standing in front of the TV.
-Oh.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.900
Wait, I can't see.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.700
Hey, Cooper, Cooper, Cooper. Cooper, n-no. Get down.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.600
Cooper, get off the table.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.500
You need to get down and sit next to your sister,

16:51.500 --> 16:53.300
or you're gonna have to go to bed, honey.

16:53.300 --> 16:57.300
Would you like two tickets to the gun show?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.700
Can I have another polar fudgie?

17:00.700 --> 17:03.699
No, Cooper. I told you, one polar fudgie.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.199
You said two.
- I said one.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.099
You said two.
- I said one. And you know what?

17:07.099 --> 17:09.599
That, that you just said, that is a big, fat lie.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.700
And you and I cannot have a relationship based on lies.

17:12.700 --> 17:16.098
Now listen to me about that, because I know.

17:16.099 --> 17:16.999
You said two.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.400
Can you pause it? I have to pee.
- Hey, I showed you.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.599
Look, you just hit this button right here.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.700
But it's not working.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.799
Oh.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.900
Hey, didn't you just go to the bathroom

17:28.200 --> 17:30.300
like five minutes ago?
- I'm sorry.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.600
It's OK. Don't be sorry. Go on.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.100
You know what, Cooper?

17:35.100 --> 17:38.000
You are like your own little French Revolution.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.900
You said two.
- (doorbell rings)

17:39.900 --> 17:43.900
I'm just gonna... (speaks gibberish)

17:44.200 --> 17:45.600
Hey.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.100
What are you doing here?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.700
I thought you might need a study partner.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.700
Oh, a study partner, like in high school?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.900
No, a study partner like in professional journalists.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.700
Who can't help but say yes to babysitting

17:57.700 --> 18:00.800
even on the night before a gigantic interview.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.000
Brought a list of questions.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.900
And, um, compiled some background information

18:03.900 --> 18:06.800
in case, you know, you want some...extra.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.400
Right, but can you work one of these?

18:08.400 --> 18:09.600
Yeah, I think so.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.000
Okay. Well, then, you're hired.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
Oh, Cooper, where did you get that?
- I hate you.

18:17.900 --> 18:21.900
Hmm.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.900
Well, we finally did it. A Win! (laughs)

18:36.900 --> 18:38.400
But a good game played by all.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.500
I guess that was the last Donaldson/Walker match.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.900
I'm sure William is smiling at your victory.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.700
After <i>all these years.</i>

18:45.700 --> 18:47.100
Well, I would hope you got a kick

18:47.100 --> 18:48.500
outta this tourney, Nora, dear,

18:48.500 --> 18:49.900
seeing it's in honor of Poor Bill.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.200
I'm very gateful. The turnout is fabulous.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.400
Golf is a healing endeavor, Nora.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.000
That's the great lesson here -- a good game of golf

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
can solve all the world's problems.
- It's certainly helped in Iraq.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.599
You know, Kevin, you got a tight swing.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.400
Oh, so I'm told, Syd, so I'm told.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.200
Yeah, but you gotta loosen up a little bit.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.700
You'll see a big improvement. 
- And speaking of loosening up,

19:09.700 --> 19:11.200
you and Sloane will have to tell me

19:11.200 --> 19:15.100
where you got your matching flasks. (all laugh)

19:15.100 --> 19:16.600
See you inside.
- See you inside.

19:16.600 --> 19:20.000
See you inside.
- See you inside. Yeah.

19:20.000 --> 19:20.999
I'd like to roast them over a spit

19:21.000 --> 19:23.299
with apples in their yaps.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.300
It's almost over.

19:25.300 --> 19:29.100
You've been so great, Kevin. You're such a darling.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.300
I swear, this thing would've killed me.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.300
One drink, one toast, and we're leaving.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.300
No, let's go. We're leaving.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.000
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, what about the toast?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.900
No, this is too much. I'm not up for this.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.700
I'm not going in there.
- Mom, this is why we came.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.800
I know, but I was wrong. I'm not going in there.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.299
Please. Please, Kevin, let's just go home, OK?

19:58.300 --> 20:00.500
OK, OK. Let's -- Let's call it a day.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.000
OK.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Of course, we could go see "Two For the Road."

20:07.000 --> 20:08.600
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we could.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.200
We could grab dinner. We could catch the 9:00.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.600
It would really redeem everything.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.500
You look like you could use some cheering up.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
OK. Let's-- yeah. Let's do it.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.200
"Two For the Road."

20:19.200 --> 20:20.899
OK. OK.

20:20.900 --> 20:21.600
"Two For the Road."

20:21.800 --> 20:25.800
Oh, you haven't seen it, so I'm not gonna tell anything...

20:29.200 --> 20:32.000
Scrub harder, Boy.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.600
Hey, Boss.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.400
I, uh, I thought our first meeting went great downstairs.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.300
Oh, it went very well.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.400
I love it when new staff

20:39.400 --> 20:41.000
show up stoned on their first day.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
It really sets a tone.(chuckles)

20:46.100 --> 20:48.800
We used to know each other.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.400
San Marino High.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.400
Wait a second, we had classes together?

20:52.400 --> 20:55.300
"Choices and Challenges" and "Ancient History."

20:55.300 --> 20:56.800
Both of which brought me great wisdom,

20:56.800 --> 20:58.500
seeing as I'm your bellboy now.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.900
And I'm your boss. It's a great country.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.100
Yeah.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.900
So...

21:04.900 --> 21:07.400
What happened?

21:07.400 --> 21:11.400
Uh, you know, I just went through some stuff.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.400
These need to go up to 406.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.300
Uh, 406.

21:17.300 --> 21:21.000
* I can tell a trillion things*

21:21.000 --> 21:23.699
*from the way you walk*

21:23.700 --> 21:25.400
Hey. They're asleep?

21:25.700 --> 21:29.100
Yeah. I feel like I just ran a marathon...

21:29.100 --> 21:31.300
in ski boots.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.400
Your prep for this interview looks fantastic.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.700
Well, thank you.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.000
You look beautiful tonight.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.899
Oh, Warren. No, stop.
- Look, I'm sorry.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.400
I'm sorry, you do, OK?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.200
And it's fun seeing you with kids.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.900
Oh, Warren, you know what? You lied.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.000
(laughs) About what? I didn't lie.
- Yes, you did.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.100
Yes, you did. This is just like high school.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.700
You came over here claiming to be my study partner,

21:52.700 --> 21:56.700
and you really just wanted to...say that.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.700
I want to say a lot more than that.

21:59.700 --> 22:02.100
Well, you can't.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.200
(sighs) I'm sorry, but...

22:04.200 --> 22:08.200
You know, what we did, it was a mistake.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.300
And...

22:10.400 --> 22:11.599
I really want to make it work

22:11.600 --> 22:13.600
with Jonathan, and...

22:14.300 --> 22:15.200
And... (sighs)

22:15.200 --> 22:18.600
I'm not gonna just stop something that's old

22:18.600 --> 22:20.900
just for the possibility of something that's new.

22:20.900 --> 22:24.100
It's just not the kind of person I am.

22:24.100 --> 22:24.700
When I'm with you,

22:24.700 --> 22:27.400
I don't know what kind of person I am.

22:27.400 --> 22:31.400
And I find that...kind of interesting.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.600
Aunt Kitty.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.810
Hey! Hey, honey. What's up?
- Can I have a glass of water?

22:37.810 --> 22:39.810
Wow, you are really a thirsty girl lately, aren't you?

22:40.700 --> 22:42.199
I'm 60% water.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.200
Em...right.

22:44.700 --> 22:48.700
Warren, I really appreciate your help. I mean it.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.499
You got it.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.500
Can you let yourself out?

22:52.500 --> 22:54.199
Sure, yeah, I can do that.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.399
OK. Let's go.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.400
* I Just Can't Let You Go*

23:00.500 --> 23:01.700
I don't know, your brothers and sisters,

23:02.000 --> 23:03.800
they hate culture. I don't understand it.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.000
They don't hate culture, they're just real people...

23:06.000 --> 23:07.700
with better things to do.

23:07.700 --> 23:10.100
*We'll travel through the years*

23:10.100 --> 23:12.400
*Collecting precious memories*

23:12.400 --> 23:16.300
Would you excuse me for a second?

23:16.300 --> 23:20.300
*Selecting souvenirs*

23:21.600 --> 23:24.100
Mr. Walker.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.100
Of course you'd come to see "Two For the Road,"

23:26.100 --> 23:27.100
you tough attorney-at-law.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.300
Look, I'm so sorry.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.700
I-I know I was supposed to call you.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.400
My--my mom kinda hijacked my day.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.600
Oh, that's OK. I find ways to keep busy.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.200
There's the gym, gainful employment, suitors.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.700
I got the tickets.

23:39.700 --> 23:41.800
Randy, this is the lawyer I mentioned.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.700
Kevin Walker, Randy Stewart.
- Hi.

23:43.700 --> 23:45.700
Hi. I've heard a lot about you.

23:45.700 --> 23:49.400
Oh, really? Well, he--he's not a very accurate witness,

23:49.400 --> 23:51.400
so if they're bad things, know that he exaggerates.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.800
Well, they haven't been bad at all.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.800
He said you were very honorable.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.700
Wow. Well, you know, that's just my suits.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.400
They, uh, they--they give the impression of,

24:02.400 --> 24:03.600
um, they make me seem like someone I'm not.
- Scotty!

24:03.600 --> 24:05.500
Oh, Mrs. Walker. Hi.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.100
Uh, this is my friend, Randy.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.800
Hi. Oh, we should sit together.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.600
No. <i>No.</i> NO.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.099
(Kevin) No. Well, you know, I mean,

24:11.100 --> 24:13.300
I'm--I'm sure we won't get four seats together.

24:13.700 --> 24:17.600
So, um...we--come on. Let's go.

24:17.700 --> 24:20.100
Nice to meet you, Randy.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.200
We'll wait in the car.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.500
Good night.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.200
I'll be there in a sec.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.700
Did you guys have a good time?

24:26.700 --> 24:28.000
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.800
We did our usual "Sarah and Joe" thing.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.200
It was fine.
- Hey, um--

24:32.200 --> 24:34.400
What? What? I gotta go.

24:34.400 --> 24:38.400
I think something is up with Paige.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.300
What's that supposed to mean?

24:40.300 --> 24:42.300
She just seems to be really thirsty,

24:42.300 --> 24:45.000
she's peeing a lot and sleeping a lot.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.700
Look, I know my daughter pretty well.

24:47.700 --> 24:48.600
I'm with her every day,

24:48.600 --> 24:51.600
and I don't really appreciate being accused of --
- Sarah, I am--

24:51.600 --> 24:53.100
I'm just trying to help.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.000
No one asked for your help. And by the way,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.300
the next time you have something to say about me,

24:58.300 --> 25:01.700
like how I retreat into my work like dad,

25:01.700 --> 25:03.300
or whatever the hell it was you said to Joe,

25:03.300 --> 25:05.500
could you please say it to my face?

25:05.500 --> 25:09.500
'Cause I would really appreciate it.

25:11.500 --> 25:15.500
Thanks for babysitting.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.800
Kevin, I have one last document

25:23.900 --> 25:26.500
for your mother to sign regarding the sale of the house.

25:26.500 --> 25:29.200
They just faxed it to me from the title company.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.200
So, if you could pass by and have her sign it.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.100
Yeah, of course.

25:32.100 --> 25:33.000
Wouldn't be a day in my life

25:33.000 --> 25:35.500
without some errand involving Mom.

25:35.500 --> 25:39.500
Well, welcome to my life for the past, uh...forever.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.000
Have you...given any more thought

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
to getting a criminal lawyer?

25:48.200 --> 25:52.200
You're talking about the pension fund, huh?

25:53.100 --> 25:55.000
That lovely situation your father left us with,

25:55.000 --> 25:56.200
among other things.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.800
Yeah, yeah. The clock is kinda ticking.
- I was promised six months.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.400
I know, and a lot of good people, you know,

26:01.400 --> 26:02.900
beg for more time in these situations.

26:02.900 --> 26:06.900
They end up burying themselves. We go to the authorities now--
- It would destroy your mother.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.700
OK. It could destroy you if we wait any longer.

26:10.700 --> 26:14.700
Believe me, Kevin, I know.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.500
Two weeks ago,

26:20.500 --> 26:23.300
she found about your father and Holly.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.300
If she learns that your father put the company

26:25.300 --> 26:27.800
and the future of her family, her children and grandchildren,

26:27.800 --> 26:30.900
in that kind of jeopardy...

26:30.900 --> 26:34.900
No, I can't let that happen.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.100
You sounded so ignorant, Sherry.
- I'm sorry.

26:38.100 --> 26:39.300
Promise me that when we go back down

26:39.300 --> 26:40.400
to have dinner with the guys tonight

26:40.400 --> 26:42.200
that you'll keep your mouth shut.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.200
I cannot afford to look bad this evening.
I <i>said</i> I'm sorry.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.500
Hey, Smiley, why don't you do your job

26:52.500 --> 26:56.500
and mind your own business?

27:13.800 --> 27:16.100
So, we're not talking anymore? That's what the deal is?

27:16.100 --> 27:18.800
No. I've been talking ever since I came home,

27:18.800 --> 27:19.600
and listening.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.300
Your afternoon lesson was terrific.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.300
That is not what I mean.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.200
No, you mean are we gonna talk about

27:24.200 --> 27:25.800
what it is that I'm angry about,

27:25.800 --> 27:29.300
and the answer to that is "no." Talk to Kitty.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.800
Sarah, you know how I feel about your family.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.200
The gossip traffic -- it moves so damn fast,

27:34.200 --> 27:36.300
I stay on the sidewalk just to keep from getting killed.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.900
Then why did you talk to her about me, about us?

27:38.900 --> 27:42.900
Because I'm at the point right now, Sarah

27:43.000 --> 27:45.700
I'm willing to try anything to find a way in.

27:45.700 --> 27:48.200
I am the way in to me, Joe,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.900
not through my hypercritical,

27:50.900 --> 27:53.900
expert-in-all-things-marital, little perfect sister.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.400
But you don't talk to me about anything.
- Because I can't.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.000
Because -- because what's happening at the company,

27:59.000 --> 28:00.900
the mess that my dear, departed father

28:00.900 --> 28:03.300
left <i>me</i> to clean up is so filthy, so rotten,

28:03.300 --> 28:07.100
that if I tell you, you could go to jail.

28:07.100 --> 28:10.100
Your dad did something illegal?

28:10.100 --> 28:13.200
Very.

28:13.200 --> 28:17.200
What's for dinner?

28:17.500 --> 28:20.500
Your grandmother's crazy spaghetti.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.100
Blech.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.900
I know. I have chicken tenders.

28:22.900 --> 28:26.300
Where's your sister?
- Asleep.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.000
She was tired when she came home from school.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.300
She took a nap.
- Since when?

28:31.300 --> 28:34.400
3:30.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.700
It's almost 6:00.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.600
She's tired. I figured, you know, let her sleep.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.400
Paige.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.000
Paige!

28:42.000 --> 28:44.200
If you didn't want to go the golf tournament, Kevin,

28:44.200 --> 28:46.900
you shouldn't have offered.
- Did I really have a choice?

28:46.900 --> 28:48.200
Yes, of course you did.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.700
Well, I didn't feel like I did, and that's the point, Mom.

28:50.700 --> 28:54.700
I never do. Do you think I like being your "plus one"?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.100
Do you think it makes me feel good

28:56.100 --> 28:58.000
the rest of the family has a life, and I have nothing?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.700
Nothing? What, you have a mother who loves you--
- Yes, I have a mother who loves me.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.200
I also have a mother who's terrified of being alone

29:03.200 --> 29:05.600
and thinks it's her gay son's job

29:05.600 --> 29:07.800
to fill some void that even Dad knew better

29:07.800 --> 29:09.090
than to try and fill.
- I don't want to do this, Kevin.

29:09.090 --> 29:10.900
Well, look, I'm sorry, Mom,

29:10.900 --> 29:12.400
but I had a date with Scotty last night,

29:12.400 --> 29:14.200
and what's where I should've been,

29:14.200 --> 29:17.500
not out on the town with my friggin' mom.
- What are you guys up to?

29:17.500 --> 29:19.400
They can hear you all the way down the block.
- You know,

29:19.400 --> 29:22.500
it's manipulation, Mom. It's manipulation, pure and simple.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.000
You've done it Uncle Saul's whole life,

29:24.000 --> 29:27.300
and now you're doing it to me.
- Uncle Saul? What does he have to do with it?

29:27.300 --> 29:29.500
What? Nothing. I - nothing.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.600
I was just with him this morning to get the title form.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.400
He talked to you about that woman, didn't he?

29:34.400 --> 29:37.100
He talked to you about Holly.
- No, he talked about you.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.500
You know, he spends so much time

29:38.500 --> 29:40.500
weighing and considering different ways in which

29:40.500 --> 29:42.800
you <i>might</i> get hurt by this action or that information.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.000
He has feelings for that woman. I knew it. I knew it!

29:46.000 --> 29:47.500
He said nothing about a woman!

29:47.500 --> 29:50.300
Sweet God, would you let me finish?

29:50.300 --> 29:52.100
You know, he spends his whole life--

29:52.100 --> 29:54.400
his whole life in terms of you, and I do, too.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.200
And I just wish you would be a little more sensitive to that.

29:57.200 --> 30:01.200
Sensitive? Wh-- sensitive? Kitty, am I insensitive?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.200
Mom, I have to go to the studio.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.200
I have a very important interview.
- What, I'm insensitive?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.600
Mom, you hung up a family picture without me in it!

30:08.600 --> 30:11.100
Don't ask me if I think you're insensitive.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.200
You know what? I am not gonna be ganged up on here.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.100
This is <i>so,</i> so totally unfair.

30:16.100 --> 30:19.900
Totally, totally unfair.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.000
I lost my husband once,

30:21.000 --> 30:22.900
and then I lost him again to that woman.

30:22.900 --> 30:25.500
I put that picture up because I was trying to hold on

30:25.500 --> 30:27.300
to what I remember as one good day, just one.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.700
and, <i>oh,</i> I'm so sorry you weren't there.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.800
But it was <i>your</i> decision to run off to New York.

30:31.800 --> 30:35.300
Do you really think it was my decision to move to New York?

30:35.300 --> 30:39.300
You drove me away.

30:41.200 --> 30:44.300
I'll get it.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.900
Hello.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.400
Whoa. Whoa, Sa- Sarah. Calm down.

30:49.400 --> 30:53.400
What are you saying? She's what?

30:54.000 --> 30:54.900
Yeah, yeah, of co--

30:54.900 --> 30:57.200
Yeah, of course. Yeah. We'll be right there.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.200
Okay, bye. Bye.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.800
Uh, Joe and Sarah just took Paige to the hospital.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.100
She's been asleep for a few hours.

31:03.100 --> 31:07.100
She's not waking up.

31:14.600 --> 31:15.600
Justin.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.700
Tyler, I have a room etiquette question for you.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.600
Get up.
- When they say, "Come in,"

31:20.600 --> 31:23.100
and they're doing it on the floor like crazed weasels,

31:23.100 --> 31:25.900
is it proper etiquette to pour the hibiscus tea for them?

31:25.900 --> 31:28.300
You do whatever they ask.
- Yeah, sorry.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.700
There's only so much slumming I'm willing to do.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.400
Slumming would be a step up for you.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.200
You're on the floor in a hotel hallway

31:35.200 --> 31:36.500
wasted out of your mind.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.100
Jeff is gonna take you to the break room.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.000
When you're good enough to drive, go home.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
Why not fire me? I mean, why -- why keep me around?

31:48.300 --> 31:50.700
I don't know.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.000
Maybe because....

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
I know who you used to be in high school, Justin.

31:57.600 --> 32:01.300
You were the boy with the sweetest smile.

32:01.300 --> 32:04.600
You made the future look easy.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.600
And I want to give him a second chance.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.200
(woman) Well, she had a rough go of it,

32:16.200 --> 32:18.700
but she's gonna be just fine.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.700
Her blood glucose is back down to 170,

32:20.700 --> 32:24.000
which is still a bit high, but it should be normal soon.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.900
I just feel so dumb. I didn't see it.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.200
She was with me, right in front of me, and I --

32:29.200 --> 32:32.500
Hey, we caught it. That's the important thing.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.400
Diabetes is a disease she can live with

32:34.400 --> 32:36.900
and live fully.

32:36.900 --> 32:40.200
I know. Thank you.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.100
I would like to keep her here for a few nights, though,

32:42.100 --> 32:43.600
just so she can get used to the needles

32:43.600 --> 32:44.800
and the whole thing.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.700
It can be a little daunting, and I don't want

32:46.700 --> 32:49.500
to send you guys home feeling unprepared.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.700
As long as it takes.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.800
I want you to know something, though.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.600
I see a lot of kids come through here

32:54.600 --> 32:56.800
but I don't see a lot of kids come through here

32:56.800 --> 33:00.400
with that many people in the waiting room.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.900
We're kind of a tribe.

33:01.900 --> 33:05.900
Yes, you certainly are.

33:14.700 --> 33:16.700
I love her so much.

33:16.700 --> 33:20.700
I do, too.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.700
And I love you.

33:23.700 --> 33:27.700
I love you, too.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.600
(Saul) I don't understand what's happening to this town.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.900
It took me an hour and 15 minutes to get down here.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.800
That's 'cause the shortcuts don't work anymore.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.700
You used to be able to cross town in like a half-hour.
- The shortcuts still work.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.400
Hey! I just got the message. Is she OK?

33:43.400 --> 33:46.400
She's gonna be fine. They're just talking with the doctor.

33:46.400 --> 33:50.400
OK.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.300
Why aren't you at work?

33:52.300 --> 33:54.200
'Cause I just got the call from Joe about Paige.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.400
Back off, man.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.300
Anyway, I got off early for like, you know,

33:57.300 --> 33:58.100
<i>Good behavior.</i>

33:58.100 --> 34:01.800
So you not being there has nothing to do with the fact...
- Get off me.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.000
that you're totally high right now?
- What are you talking about, man?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.300
Look, everybody else might sit around

34:06.300 --> 34:08.600
and feel bad for you, but I won't.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.600
Look, I didn't ask for your sympathy,

34:09.600 --> 34:11.100
and I certainly didn't ask for your help.

34:11.100 --> 34:14.600
When are you gonna grow up?
- Back off! You're a piece of work, just like Dad.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.400
Get off of me.
- OK.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.400
I'm not like him.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.400
Dad never stopped caring about what you did

34:21.400 --> 34:22.400
with your life.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.600
I do. I stop right now.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.600
I stop today.

34:40.300 --> 34:44.300
All right. Just...

35:02.900 --> 35:06.900
Hi.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.200
I've never come into one of these places before.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.300
The hospital chapel--

35:12.300 --> 35:15.600
it always seemed so generic and lame.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.400
But, oh, all the emergency rooms

35:17.400 --> 35:20.500
I've been into with you kids--

35:20.500 --> 35:24.200
Tommy and his broken arm and his broken ankle...

35:24.200 --> 35:26.000
you and your asthma.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.800
It was so scary.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.500
Do you remember...Kevin and Sarah

35:32.500 --> 35:34.200
and the superglue mess?

35:34.200 --> 35:37.000
(laughs) Yeah.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.800
Justin...

35:40.800 --> 35:44.800
Oh...Justin.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.500
(sighs) I'm so worried about us.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.300
About you and me?

35:50.300 --> 35:51.400
All of us, the family.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.200
I don't know how we're gonna get through this.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.500
So much is changing since your father died.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.800
It feels like everything we swallowed down

35:58.800 --> 35:59.800
or papered over

35:59.800 --> 36:02.800
or just chose to ignore and put off fixing

36:02.800 --> 36:06.800
is coming out to haunt us.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.200
Kitty, did I drive you away?

36:11.200 --> 36:12.400
Mom--
- Did I really?

36:12.400 --> 36:15.100
Because I swear, I'll never forgive myself.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.900
We did it together.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.700
Whatever it was that happened between us,

36:18.700 --> 36:21.200
we did it together.

36:21.200 --> 36:25.200
I went out to crazy New York and I found myself...

36:25.900 --> 36:29.600
or the beginning of a self.

36:29.600 --> 36:33.400
Maybe it was supposed to happen.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.300
Yeah?

36:34.300 --> 36:36.700
Yeah.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.400
Kitty, I don't need you to agree with me.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.800
I don't need you to do anything.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.100
I just need you.

36:43.100 --> 36:45.100
I was wrong to hang that picture.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.500
I am so sorry.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.300
Ah, it's all right.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.000
No, it's not all right.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.400
I was trying to hang on

36:50.400 --> 36:52.300
to some image I had of your father

36:52.300 --> 36:56.300
instead of reaching out to you.

37:06.600 --> 37:10.600
Paige is awake.

37:11.800 --> 37:15.800
Come on.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.400
This is the best bottle of cheap wine I could find.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.600
Why not a really big, celebratory killer of a bottle?

37:27.600 --> 37:31.000
because sometimes, with wine,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.700
you want to celebrate a small victory.

37:33.700 --> 37:36.900
If you can find a modest surprise

37:36.900 --> 37:38.000
from a sturdy grape

37:38.000 --> 37:40.100
that doesn't cost an arm and a leg,

37:40.100 --> 37:44.100
you, my dear, are in sync with the rest of the world.

37:44.900 --> 37:45.700
Understand?

37:45.700 --> 37:47.600
I <i>never</i> understand you, Saul.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.400
But I like your wine.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.300
Cheers.

37:51.300 --> 37:52.800
(all) Cheers.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.599
*Too much here for me to love*

37:56.600 --> 37:57.999
<i>Your take on the Middle East</i>
<i>is the only thing...</i>

37:58.000 --> 37:59.900
Ah, you know, he's actually being a lot more artful

38:00.300 --> 38:03.100
than I thought he would be.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.900
(clicks tongue) Wow. What a relief.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.100
Jonathan, I have to go. You know what?

38:07.100 --> 38:07.800
I'll call you tomorrow,

38:07.800 --> 38:11.700
and we'll plan a weekend somewhere, OK?

38:11.700 --> 38:13.700
Bye.

38:13.700 --> 38:14.600
Hey.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.400
Hey.
- What are you doing here?

38:16.400 --> 38:18.300
Oh, Joe stayed overnight at the hospital.

38:18.300 --> 38:22.100
I figured Cooper and I could use a sleepover.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.700
Hmm, yeah. How's Paige doing?

38:24.700 --> 38:27.200
She's asleep.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.600
She's stable,

38:28.600 --> 38:32.600
which is more than I can say for her mother.

38:34.100 --> 38:38.100
(sniffles) Oh...

38:39.100 --> 38:41.300
You were right about Paige.

38:41.300 --> 38:42.400
I'm sorry.

38:42.400 --> 38:45.000
Well, you were right about me.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.500
I never should have said anything to Joe.
- Oh, it's over, Kitty.

38:47.500 --> 38:51.300
No, no, I-I, you know, I just, sometimes, I--

38:51.300 --> 38:52.400
I get jealous.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.100
Of me?
- Mm-hmm.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.300
(laughs) Get serious.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.800
It's true. I do.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.800
I'd trade lives with you in a second.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.000
I'm really gonna need you, Kitty.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.500
All of the doctors' appointments

39:09.500 --> 39:10.800
and work is...

39:10.800 --> 39:12.000
Sarah...

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
Hey, Sarah, I'm there.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.900
Oh, I just -- I just realized, your show--

39:21.900 --> 39:23.000
Were they OK with you--?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.900
Oh, please. Yeah. You know, I didn't miss anything.

39:24.900 --> 39:28.900
I-I was right where I was supposed to be.

39:29.100 --> 39:33.100
Oh, you're the best.

39:33.900 --> 39:37.900
Oh.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.700
Saul.

39:43.700 --> 39:44.900
You've got that look,

39:44.900 --> 39:47.500
that "Nora has a plan" look.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.300
No. After a night like tonight,

39:49.300 --> 39:52.700
I have no plans, only questions.

39:52.700 --> 39:55.700
What? What--What kind of questions?

39:55.700 --> 39:58.400
Do you have feelings for Holly?

39:58.400 --> 40:00.800
Feelings on a grand scale?

40:00.800 --> 40:02.400
No.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.400
Human sympathy, the beginning of a friendship?

40:06.700 --> 40:08.300
Yeah, maybe.

40:08.300 --> 40:12.300
Well, if you ever decide or admit or discover

40:13.100 --> 40:15.900
there's more than that,

40:15.900 --> 40:17.700
you have my blessing, OK?

40:17.700 --> 40:20.600
(k.d. lang) *There is a town in North Ontario*

40:20.600 --> 40:23.900
Sister?

40:23.900 --> 40:27.100
I appreciate your blessing, deeply.

40:27.100 --> 40:29.300
But I didn't ask for it.

40:29.300 --> 40:30.600
I know.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.800
And I don't need it.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.500
That's fair.

40:35.500 --> 40:39.500
That's completely fair.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
*All my changes were there*

40:44.600 --> 40:46.800
Hey, Bro. Can I talk to you for a sec?

40:47.200 --> 40:48.500
No.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.000
Come on, man. Just let me talk.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.700
I meant what I said at the hospital, Justin.

40:53.700 --> 40:54.900
I'm done.

40:54.900 --> 40:58.900
*Yellow moon on the rise*

41:03.800 --> 41:06.600
What you need there is a big, ugly thing

41:06.600 --> 41:07.900
with macrame and twine,

41:07.900 --> 41:10.200
like a wall sculpture from the 60s.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.800
From the flea market. We'll go together.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.700
Yeah, we'll call the guy I like and his boyfriend.

41:13.700 --> 41:15.800
They can meet us there. (laughs)

41:15.800 --> 41:19.100
Ah, you took down the abomination.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.900
What are you gonna put there instead?

41:20.900 --> 41:22.100
Oh, it doesn't need anything.

41:22.100 --> 41:24.200
It's perfect just the way it is--

41:24.200 --> 41:26.000
Emptiness.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Emptiness? No, no, no, no, no.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.700
There will be no emptiness in my house.

41:30.700 --> 41:32.600
So what are you gonna put there, Mom?

41:32.600 --> 41:36.600
*Will you sing with me somehow?*

41:37.600 --> 41:40.100
*Helpless, helpless*

41:40.100 --> 41:44.100
*Helpless*

41:45.300 --> 41:46.300
*Helpless*

41:46.300 --> 41:47.800
*Helpless, helpless*

41:47.800 --> 41:51.800
*Helpless*

41:52.700 --> 41:59.200
*Helpless*

42:00.305 --> 42:06.912
