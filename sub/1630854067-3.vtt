04:41.400 --> 04:45.000

I might take you up on that.</i>

04:45.000 --> 04:46.760

04:46.760 --> 04:49.000

<i>I thought maybe you could help.</i>

07:42.600 --> 07:45.400
<i>This is Luke. He's about 14 there.</i>

07:45.400 --> 07:47.760
<i>And that's him in the middle.</i>

07:47.760 --> 07:50.520
<i>Think that must've been taken
not long before he left.</i>

07:50.520 --> 07:53.520
<i>And you're sure that he was
officially reported missing?</i>

07:53.520 --> 07:55.280
<i>Mm-hm. Did it myself.</i>

07:55.280 --> 07:58.600
<i>My mum didn't even notice he'd gone.</i>

07:59.720 --> 08:01.600
<i>And what did the police say?</i>

08:01.600 --> 08:04.880
<i>Well, it wasn't the first time,
so he was already on their radar,</i>

08:04.880 --> 08:07.840
<i>and I don't think they took it seriously.</i>

08:07.840 --> 08:09.960
<i>So there was no follow-up at all?</i>

08:09.960 --> 08:11.080
<i>No.</i>

08:11.080 --> 08:14.360
<i>Nothing.
They just thought he'd turn up.</i>

08:14.360 --> 08:15.560
<i>Hmm.</i>

08:15.560 --> 08:20.560
<i>These are his letters. He wrote

<i>Christmas, birthdays.</i>

<i>And, er, when was the last time
you heard from him?</i>

<i>Be a year this April. And it's the

in this area for over 30 years,</i>

22:58.080 --> 23:02.480
<i>but his sister is very, very keen
to get back in touch,</i>

23:02.480 --> 23:05.120
<i>so if you know Luke Marbury,</i>

23:05.120 --> 23:07.800
<i>if you have any information
about him at all,</i>

23:07.800 --> 23:10.160
<i>then please, please, please
give us a call</i>

23:10.160 --> 23:14.200
<i>and help to reunite a family.</i>

23:14.200 --> 23:16.000
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:21.960 --> 23:23.880
<i>BIRDSONG</i>

23:39.320 --> 23:41.680
<i>POLICE RADIO CHATTER</i>

23:49.280 --> 23:51.600
<i>Thanks for coming, Ridley.</i>

23:51.600 --> 23:53.200
<i>Yeah, no worries. What's the story?</i>

23:53.200 --> 23:56.160
<i>Woman found dead
from some sort of neck injury.</i>

23:56.160 --> 23:58.920
<i>Time of death?
Somewhere between 11 pm and 2 am.</i>

23:58.920 --> 24:01.040
<i>Any idea exactly how she died?</i>

24:01.040 --> 24:03.480
<i>Well, it looks like
she fell backwards on to her bag</i>

24:03.480 --> 24:05.680
<i>which contained
a glass vodka bottle.</i>

24:05.680 --> 24:07.400
<i>The bottle shattered on impact</i>

24:07.400 --> 24:09.720
<i>and a shard of glass severed
the carotid artery in her neck</i>

24:09.720 --> 24:11.680
<i>resulting in sudden and severe
blood loss.</i>

24:11.680 --> 24:13.720
<i>Right.
So it could have been an accident?</i>

24:13.720 --> 24:17.040
<i>Or the consequence of an assault.
Post mortem might tell us more.</i>

24:17.040 --> 24:20.400
<i>Her name's Julie Conway. She's 46.
Known to the police.</i>

24:20.400 --> 24:22.880
<i>A history of minor alcohol-related
incidents.</i>

24:22.880 --> 24:24.800
<i>Julie Conway?</i>

24:24.800 --> 24:25.880
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:25.880 --> 24:26.920
<i>Are you sure?</i>

24:26.920 --> 24:28.760
<i>I found ID in her bag.</i>

24:28.760 --> 24:30.200
<i>Do you know her?</i>

24:30.200 --> 24:34.080
<i>No, she's the lead on that
missing persons case I'm working on.</i>

24:34.080 --> 24:35.680
<i>I was supposed to see her today.</i>

24:35.680 --> 24:38.200
<i>Maybe someone
didn't want that to happen.</i>

24:38.200 --> 24:39.840
<i>Who called it in?</i>

24:39.840 --> 24:41.440
<i>Just a fella walking a dog.</i>

24:41.440 --> 24:44.000
<i>Was there any witnesses
to the actual incident?</i>

24:44.000 --> 24:45.880
<i>There was a group of teenagers here
all night.</i>

24:45.880 --> 24:48.800
<i>They heard raised voices around
midnight, saw someone hurrying away.</i>

24:48.800 --> 24:49.880
<i>Man or a woman?</i>

24:49.880 --> 24:52.360
<i>It was too dark to tell. They
wrote it off as a drunken barney.</i>

24:52.360 --> 24:53.720
<i>They didn't wanna get involved.</i>

24:53.720 --> 24:55.280
<i>Do we know a next of kin?</i>

24:55.280 --> 24:57.840
<i>Yeah, Donna Wellingfield,
the victim's sister.</i>

24:57.840 --> 24:59.240
<i>She runs a caff on Rugton Street.</i>

24:59.240 --> 25:00.400
<i>We'll need to speak to her.</i>

25:00.400 --> 25:03.760
<i>Would it be obvious to whoever she
was with that she was in trouble?</i>

25:03.760 --> 25:06.840
<i>A severed artery pumps blood
with significant force.</i>

25:06.840 --> 25:08.600
<i>Hard to miss, even at night.</i>

25:08.600 --> 25:11.200
<i>So why did they leave her to die?</i>

25:13.280 --> 25:16.520
<i>'People were always drawn
to our Julie.</i>

25:16.520 --> 25:19.680
<i>'In another life
she could have been a movie star,</i>

25:19.680 --> 25:22.600
<i>'but she made bad choices.</i>

25:22.600 --> 25:25.960
<i>'Started drinking young.
Couldn't stop.'</i>

25:25.960 --> 25:30.520
<i>Alcohol meant more to Julie
than anything or anyone.</i>

25:30.520 --> 25:32.840
<i>That must have been hard.</i>

25:32.840 --> 25:36.960
<i>Did she have any significant
relationships that you know of?</i>

25:36.960 --> 25:38.240
<i>Well, she never married,</i>

25:38.240 --> 25:41.320
<i>but she was with Jed Varnham
off and on for years.</i>

25:41.320 --> 25:44.760
<i>Jed Varnham.
Any relation to Julian Varnham?</i>

25:44.760 --> 25:48.080
<i>Yeah, his son.
At first I thought she was punching.</i>

25:48.080 --> 25:49.840
<i>Our Julie and a Varnham!</i>

25:49.840 --> 25:53.040
<i>But... he was even more damaged
than she was back then.</i>

25:53.040 --> 25:56.960
<i>In what way?
Oh... Drink. Drugs.</i>

25:56.960 --> 25:59.000
<i>He managed to get himself clean, though.</i>

25:59.000 --> 26:02.120
<i>So they didn't stay together, then,
or...?</i>

26:02.120 --> 26:06.520
<i>He tried his best,
I'll give him that. We all did.</i>

26:08.400 --> 26:10.160
<i>But she made his life a nightmare.</i>

26:11.640 --> 26:14.240
<i>Still didn't stop her
inheriting from his old man, though.</i>

26:14.240 --> 26:16.160
<i>What do you mean?</i>

26:16.160 --> 26:20.160
<i>She called me yesterday, told me
she'd been left a house in his will.</i>

26:21.240 --> 26:23.600
<i>Wanted me to know
it would be mine one day.</i>

26:23.600 --> 26:26.200
<i>She was drunk.</i>

26:26.200 --> 26:29.280
<i>I mean, I hadn't spoken to her
in months.</i>

26:29.280 --> 26:31.360
<i>Julian Varnham left your sister
a house -</i>

26:31.360 --> 26:33.080
<i>why the hell would he do that?</i>

26:33.080 --> 26:35.080
<i>I have no idea.</i>

26:35.080 --> 26:37.400
<i>I asked her to come over
and explain, you know,</i>

26:37.400 --> 26:39.240
<i>when she was sober. But...</i>

26:41.360 --> 26:43.120
<i>Well, that never happened.</i>

26:46.000 --> 26:47.680
<i>You'd be better off talking to Jed.</i>

26:47.680 --> 26:51.520
<i>Have you got any idea
where we might find him? Yeah.</i>

26:51.520 --> 26:54.120
<i>The old barge on the canal,
you know, by Bilton Lane lock?</i>

26:54.120 --> 26:55.560
<i>Yeah, I know that.</i>

26:55.560 --> 26:57.640
<i>Or you could you try his sister Liza.</i>

26:57.640 --> 27:00.840
<i>She moved in with her dad
after his second stroke.</i>

27:00.840 --> 27:03.880
<i>We're looking for your brother,
Ms Varnham.</i>

27:03.880 --> 27:05.800
<i>Well, you won't find him here.</i>

27:05.800 --> 27:08.080
<i>He's been estranged from the family
for many years.</i>

27:08.080 --> 27:10.880
<i>Well, it's really important
that we speak to him.</i>

27:10.880 --> 27:13.480
<i>We've been to the barge,
but there's no sign of him there.</i>

27:13.480 --> 27:15.160
<i>What's this about?</i>

27:15.160 --> 27:18.040
<i>Julie Conway was found dead
this morning.</i>

27:19.640 --> 27:21.120
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

27:23.120 --> 27:25.280
<i>We just need to talk to him.</i>

27:26.480 --> 27:29.760
<i>We understand that Julie
was due to inherit some property</i>

27:29.760 --> 27:31.600
<i>from your father's estate,
is that right?</i>

27:31.600 --> 27:35.280
<i>Yeah. Ravenstoop. Up on Bilton Moor.</i>

27:35.280 --> 27:37.360
<i>Belonged to my great grandfather.</i>

27:37.360 --> 27:41.680
<i>Hmm. So why would your father
leave that to Julie?</i>

27:43.040 --> 27:45.960
<i>Dad was vulnerable
after his second stroke,</i>

27:45.960 --> 27:51.480
<i>and Julie was
a very manipulative person.</i>

27:51.480 --> 27:54.640
<i>But you never saw her here,
with your father?</i>

27:54.640 --> 27:56.960
<i>No. But then I work full time,</i>

27:56.960 --> 27:59.680
<i>and some of the carers
were less than vigilant.</i>

27:59.680 --> 28:02.960
<i>How did Jed feel about Ravenstoop
being left to Julie?</i>

28:02.960 --> 28:04.880
<i>Like I said, we don't really speak.</i>

28:04.880 --> 28:07.040
<i>Can you tell us why?</i>

28:09.840 --> 28:13.840
<i>Jed went off the rails, big time.</i>

28:13.840 --> 28:16.440
<i>And that's how he found Julie.</i>

28:16.440 --> 28:21.680
<i>We tried to reach out,
but she poisoned him against us.</i>

28:21.680 --> 28:24.720
<i>He wouldn't even say goodbye
to his own father.</i>

28:29.520 --> 28:34.760
<i>Julie Conway was found dead at
Allerton Bridge Park this morning.</i>

28:34.760 --> 28:38.680
<i>Her carotid artery was severed
by a shard of broken glass.</i>

28:38.680 --> 28:41.280
<i>Now, initially, we believed
it could have been an accident,</i>

28:41.280 --> 28:43.400
<i>but according to the evidence,
the PM,</i>

28:43.400 --> 28:47.760
<i>it indicates that she was
deliberately pushed.</i>

28:47.760 --> 28:49.960
<i>A witness reported a heated argument</i>

28:49.960 --> 28:52.040
<i>a few hours before the body
was found</i>

28:52.040 --> 28:54.320
<i>which confirms that
she wasn't alone,</i>

28:54.320 --> 28:58.440
<i>so finding that person is obviously
of great interest to us.</i>

28:58.440 --> 29:00.400
<i>So separate to this investigation,</i>

29:00.400 --> 29:03.200
<i>I'm looking into an historic
missing persons case,</i>

29:03.200 --> 29:06.160
<i>which I think may be connected.
How?</i>

29:06.160 --> 29:09.240
<i>Luke Marbury was reported missing
in 1989.</i>

29:09.240 --> 29:11.200
<i>It turns out
that he and Julie Conway</i>

29:11.200 --> 29:14.400
<i>used to run with the same bunch
of teenagers back in the day.</i>

29:14.400 --> 29:17.960
<i>Ridley starts asking questions
about Luke's disappearance</i>

29:17.960 --> 29:20.640
<i>and then the following day,
Julie turns up dead.</i>

29:20.640 --> 29:24.280
<i>However, this is the day after
Julie inherits a house</i>

29:24.280 --> 29:28.040
<i>from the late Julian Varnham's
estate. It's up on Bilton Moor.</i>

29:28.040 --> 29:30.160
<i>It's called Ravenstoop.</i>

29:30.160 --> 29:32.920
<i>And that was a bit of a shock
to Julian's daughter Liza,</i>

29:32.920 --> 29:34.840
<i>who believed the house
was gonna be left to her.</i>

29:34.840 --> 29:37.480
<i>So Luke Marbury's
a person of interest?</i>

29:37.480 --> 29:38.520
<i>We can't rule him out.</i>

29:38.520 --> 29:41.680
<i>Do we know why he left Ravenstoop
to Julie Conway?</i>

29:41.680 --> 29:45.600
<i>Well, Liza believes that Julie
coerced their vulnerable father</i>

29:45.600 --> 29:48.720
<i>into changing his will, but
there's no evidence to back that up.</i>

29:48.720 --> 29:51.280
<i>We need to speak to Jed Varnham,</i>

29:51.280 --> 29:55.240
<i>who, so far, has evaded all attempts
we've made to contact him.</i>

29:55.240 --> 29:58.640
<i>I think we should focus
on the murder enquiry for now.</i>

29:58.640 --> 30:00.080
<i>Where are we so far?</i>

30:00.080 --> 30:02.560
<i>Trying to establish
Julie Conway's movements</i>

30:02.560 --> 30:06.360
<i>after the meeting with the Varnhams.
Where was she? And who was she with?</i>

30:06.360 --> 30:09.120
<i>There's a few houses
with security cameras on Alcott Way.</i>

30:09.120 --> 30:10.680
<i>I'm getting those checked out now.</i>

30:10.680 --> 30:12.360
<i>Make sure I'm kept fully updated.</i>

30:18.200 --> 30:20.840
<i>So, are we pressing pause
on the missing file?</i>

30:20.840 --> 30:23.040
<i>For now, yeah. But Ridley's right.</i>

30:23.040 --> 30:26.040
<i>Julie's murder and
Luke's disappearance is a connection</i>

30:26.040 --> 30:27.960
<i>that we don't wanna lose sight of.</i>

30:27.960 --> 30:31.240
<i>Let's just keep it low in the mix
to keep Goodwin happy, yeah?</i>

30:31.240 --> 30:33.040
<i>Got it.</i>

30:34.160 --> 30:37.080
<i>I've managed to track down
Duncan Darwin's place of work.</i>

30:37.080 --> 30:38.480
<i>Who's Duncan Darwin?</i>

30:38.480 --> 30:41.520
<i>He's the last person to see Luke
before he went missing.</i>

30:41.520 --> 30:42.720
<i>I'm gonna go there now.</i>

30:42.720 --> 30:44.400
<i>OK. I'll keep trying Jed Varnham.</i>

30:44.400 --> 30:45.880
<i>Okey-doke.</i>

30:45.880 --> 30:47.360
<i>Boss?</i>

30:47.360 --> 30:48.560
<i>Yeah?</i>

30:50.320 --> 30:53.000
<i>Tech worked their magic
with Julie Conway's phone.</i>

30:53.000 --> 30:55.480
<i>Found a series
of abusive text messages</i>

30:55.480 --> 30:58.360
<i>between Julie and Jed Varnham.</i>

30:58.360 --> 31:00.440
<i>They really didn't like each other,
did they?</i>

31:00.440 --> 31:01.720
<i>No.</i>

31:14.360 --> 31:15.800
<i>Jed Varnham?</i>

31:17.240 --> 31:18.680
<i>Jed?</i>

31:22.840 --> 31:24.160
<i>Yeah?</i>

31:24.160 --> 31:25.960
<i>Ah, well, you're a hard man
to track down!</i>

31:25.960 --> 31:30.480
<i>DI Carol Farman. Coppelton Police.
Is it all right if we have a chat?</i>

31:32.200 --> 31:33.520
<i>Yeah, come in.</i>

31:34.560 --> 31:37.200
<i>Julie was the most beautiful girl
I'd ever seen.</i>

31:38.280 --> 31:42.360
<i>I loved her more than anything.
I still do.</i>

31:43.760 --> 31:46.240
<i>But I couldn't stop her
destroying herself.</i>

31:46.240 --> 31:47.920
<i>You mean the drinking?</i>

31:47.920 --> 31:50.880
<i>You have to be able to be honest
about the mess you're in,</i>

31:50.880 --> 31:53.640
<i>but Julie could never be honest
about anything.</i>

31:56.040 --> 31:59.240
<i>When I decided
I couldn't take anymore,</i>

31:59.240 --> 32:01.200
<i>she told me she was pregnant...</i>

32:03.080 --> 32:04.800
<i>...and then that she'd lost it.</i>

32:07.680 --> 32:12.000
<i>I really wanted that baby,
but it never even existed.</i>

32:13.040 --> 32:14.880
<i>So the relationship ended then?</i>

32:14.880 --> 32:18.520
<i>That was years ago now, but
I couldn't cut her off completely.</i>

32:20.920 --> 32:24.360
<i>And then my sister
called me out of the blue,</i>

32:24.360 --> 32:27.280
<i>said she'd found Julie...</i>

32:27.280 --> 32:29.200
<i>with my father.</i>

32:30.240 --> 32:32.880
<i>Your sister Liza? Are you sure?</i>

32:32.880 --> 32:35.560
<i>She went absolutely mental.</i>

32:35.560 --> 32:38.120
<i>What did Julie say?</i>

32:38.120 --> 32:40.120
<i>That Liza was making it up.</i>

32:40.120 --> 32:42.840
<i>But she-she wouldn't lie
about something like that,</i>

32:42.840 --> 32:46.040
<i>so I told Julie it was over
for good this time.</i>

32:46.040 --> 32:49.880
<i>We recovered some very abusive
text messages from Julie's phone.</i>

32:51.200 --> 32:54.080
<i>I wanted to make her stop,
but she wouldn't.</i>

32:54.080 --> 32:58.040
<i>I turned my phone off in the end
and she starting writing me letters</i>

32:58.040 --> 32:59.600
<i>telling me how much she hated me.</i>

33:01.160 --> 33:02.560
<i>Have you still got those?</i>

33:02.560 --> 33:03.840
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:05.240 --> 33:07.960
<i>Could... Could we see them?</i>

33:18.640 --> 33:20.160
<i>Thanks.</i>

33:24.880 --> 33:28.600
<i>Do you mind if we keep hold of these
for a bit, Jed?</i>

33:36.160 --> 33:37.560
<i>Yeah. Duncan?</i>

33:37.560 --> 33:39.120
<i>He's just underneath there.</i>

33:39.120 --> 33:41.080
<i>Ah, right, thanks, mate, thank you.</i>

33:43.120 --> 33:44.560
<i>Er, Duncan?</i>

33:44.560 --> 33:45.680
<i>Yeah?</i>

33:45.680 --> 33:46.800
<i>Duncan Darwin?</i>

33:51.440 --> 33:53.440
<i>Alex Ridley. Coppleton CID.</i>

33:53.440 --> 33:55.600
<i>I wanna ask you a few questions
about Luke Marbury.</i>

33:55.600 --> 33:58.280
<i>His sister's back from the States,
shes want to get connected.</i>

33:58.280 --> 34:00.960
<i>And what makes you think
I'd know where he is? Well...</i>

34:02.000 --> 34:04.040
<i>...you were the last person named
to have seen him.</i>

34:06.280 --> 34:07.840
<i>That's going back a bit.</i>

34:07.840 --> 34:11.800
<i>Yeah. Do you recognise anybody
in this photograph?</i>

34:13.360 --> 34:15.080
<i>That's Luke...</i>

34:16.560 --> 34:18.760
<i>...but the others, no, sorry.</i>

34:18.760 --> 34:20.520
<i>What about the girl? Julie Conway?</i>

34:20.520 --> 34:23.320
<i>I was older than him,
didn't mix in the same crowd.</i>

34:23.320 --> 34:25.560
<i>So how did you know him, then?</i>

34:27.040 --> 34:29.240
<i>Look, I was always
getting in trouble back then.</i>

34:29.240 --> 34:32.400
<i>Shoplifting, nicking cars.
Luke wanted to get involved.</i>

34:32.400 --> 34:35.840
<i>Followed me round like a puppy till
I said yes. I felt sorry for him.</i>

34:37.080 --> 34:38.920
<i>Can you tell me about the last time
you saw him?</i>

34:38.920 --> 34:42.040
<i>He'd had a massive row with his mum.
Said he couldn't take any more.</i>

34:42.040 --> 34:44.600
<i>Well, do you know where he went?</i>

34:44.600 --> 34:47.240
<i>Scrapyard over in Craydale.
They used to take kids on,</i>

34:47.240 --> 34:50.320
<i>no questions asked. I dropped him
at the station and that was it.</i>

34:50.320 --> 34:52.480
<i>And you never saw him again?
No.</i>

34:52.480 --> 34:55.280
<i>Oh, gaffer's on my case.
Gotta get back to work.</i>

34:55.280 --> 34:56.720
<i>Thanks for your time, anyway.</i>

35:07.200 --> 35:08.840
<i>RINGING</i>

35:08.840 --> 35:10.680
<i>Yeah?</i>

35:10.680 --> 35:12.920
<i>'Er, it's Ray. Ray Trevice.'</i>

35:12.920 --> 35:14.920
<i>Don't tell me
you've found the John Coltrane?</i>

35:14.920 --> 35:18.800
<i>Ah, er, no, but I'm, er...
I'm on the lookout.</i>

35:18.800 --> 35:21.360
<i>No, I got a result
from the shout-out.</i>

35:21.360 --> 35:27.400
<i>Caller said he'd seen Luke in a pub
in Craydale. The Shepherds Rest.</i>

35:27.400 --> 35:29.720
<i>About two months ago.</i>

35:29.720 --> 35:31.240
<i>Craydale? Are you sure?</i>

35:31.240 --> 35:33.160
<i>Hundred percent, yeah.</i>

35:33.160 --> 35:34.840
<i>Did you get any details?</i>

35:34.840 --> 35:38.480
<i>I tried, but, you know,
they wanted to remain anonymous.</i>

35:38.480 --> 35:40.160
<i>'Right. Male or female?'</i>

35:40.160 --> 35:44.840
<i>Male. Mature voice. Local.</i>

35:44.840 --> 35:47.520
<i>I'll keep you posted
if I hear anything else.</i>

35:47.520 --> 35:49.920
<i>All right. Thanks, Ray.</i>

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
<i>Craydale.</i>

35:56.400 --> 35:58.680
<i>We've had a response
from the radio shout-out.</i>

35:58.680 --> 36:01.480
<i>Apparently, Luke Marbury
was spotted at a pub up in Craydale</i>

36:01.480 --> 36:02.520
<i>about two months back.</i>

36:02.520 --> 36:05.040
<i>So he could be in the frame
for Julie Conway's murder.</i>

36:05.040 --> 36:08.080
<i>Yeah. We'd have to get the sighting
corroborated. Did you get a name?</i>

36:08.080 --> 36:11.720
<i>No. The, er,
caller remained anonymous.</i>

36:11.720 --> 36:13.920
<i>Darren, get on to tech,
see if they can trace it.</i>

36:13.920 --> 36:15.000
<i>Yeah, boss.</i>

36:15.000 --> 36:16.440
<i>Any sign of Jed?</i>

36:16.440 --> 36:19.440
<i>Yes. We finally got hold of him
at his barge.</i>

36:19.440 --> 36:21.080
<i>He said he'd been avoiding us</i>

36:21.080 --> 36:24.120
<i>because he'd sussed that
something bad had happened to Julie.</i>

36:24.120 --> 36:25.600
<i>And you believed him?</i>

36:25.600 --> 36:28.640
<i>I'm not sure.
He did seem genuinely sad,</i>

36:28.640 --> 36:32.200
<i>and he said that he still loved her
in spite of all the abuse.</i>

36:32.200 --> 36:34.800
<i>And there was letters
as well as text messages.</i>

36:34.800 --> 36:37.960
<i>Yeah. Make sure I'm copied in
on all that stuff, Darren, will you?</i>

36:37.960 --> 36:39.240
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

36:39.240 --> 36:40.920
<i>Where are you going with this,
Ridley?</i>

36:40.920 --> 36:42.640
<i>Well, we've already established</i>

36:42.640 --> 36:46.360
<i>that Julie Conway's death
may not be premeditated</i>

36:46.360 --> 36:49.400
<i>but a violent response
to extreme provocation,</i>

36:49.400 --> 36:52.200
<i>so that puts both
the Varnham siblings in the frame.</i>

36:52.200 --> 36:57.200
<i>Jed said that Liza told them
that she'd seen Julie at the house</i>

36:57.200 --> 37:00.760
<i>with their father, but then Liza
told us that that never happened.</i>

37:00.760 --> 37:03.960
<i>Which means that one of them
is lying.</i>

37:05.160 --> 37:07.120
<i>BIRDSONG</i>

37:13.360 --> 37:17.000
<i>Oh, sorry to call in unannounced.</i>

37:17.000 --> 37:19.960
<i>Ah, I'm grateful you did. I'd have
slept through till midnight.</i>

37:19.960 --> 37:21.360
<i>Fancy a coffee?</i>

37:21.360 --> 37:23.000
<i>Caffeine would be good.</i>

37:23.000 --> 37:25.320
<i>Cup of coffee, thanks.
Yes, sir. Good lad.</i>

37:25.320 --> 37:29.080
<i>Listen, I've been called in
to consult on a murder enquiry,</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:31.720
<i>a girl called Julie Conway.</i>

37:31.720 --> 37:34.320
<i>She's the girl in the photograph
with Luke.</i>

37:35.520 --> 37:37.360
<i>And you think
there might be a connection?</i>

37:37.360 --> 37:39.680
<i>Well, it's always a possibility,
isn't it?</i>

37:41.000 --> 37:44.400
<i>But the good news is, is that
someone phoned the radio station</i>

37:44.400 --> 37:48.360
<i>and said that they saw Luke in a pub
up in Craydale about two months ago.</i>

37:48.360 --> 37:52.000
<i>Now, the caller was anonymous,
but there was a witness at the time</i>

37:52.000 --> 37:54.640
<i>who said that's where he was heading
the day he went missing,</i>

37:54.640 --> 37:56.280
<i>to some scrap yard up there.</i>

37:56.280 --> 37:59.920
<i>Alderford's. I've dragged Luke home
from there a couple of times.</i>

37:59.920 --> 38:02.560
<i>Anyway, I'm thinking about
checking out the pub tomorrow.</i>

38:02.560 --> 38:03.800
<i>Why don't I come with you?</i>

38:03.800 --> 38:07.160
<i>I'm not... I don't think
that's a good idea, Eve.</i>

38:07.160 --> 38:11.200
<i>Why not? I know the area.
I've got nothing better to do.</i>

38:11.200 --> 38:14.520
<i>Yeah, but it may not be good news.</i>

38:14.520 --> 38:16.360
<i>I'm aware of that.</i>

38:18.000 --> 38:19.400
<i>OK.</i>

38:54.320 --> 38:56.960
<i>Well, the caller said
he was spotted in a pub up here,</i>

38:56.960 --> 38:59.720
<i>but it certainly wasn't this one.
It's all boarded up.</i>

38:59.720 --> 39:02.040
<i>Is there another pub in the village?
Don't think so.</i>

39:02.040 --> 39:04.240
<i>Well, the scrap yard's still there,</i>

39:04.240 --> 39:07.480
<i>so do you think if he was in
the area he might go and see them?</i>

39:07.480 --> 39:11.120
<i>Luke was more at home here
than he ever was with us, so yeah.</i>

39:11.120 --> 39:13.480
<i>If he was gonna seek anyone out,
it'd be them.</i>

39:13.480 --> 39:15.800
<i>Right. Well, let's try that, then.</i>

39:15.800 --> 39:17.560
<i>OK.</i>

39:17.560 --> 39:21.720
<i>So the property opposite
Julie Conway's has a camera.</i>

39:21.720 --> 39:23.720
<i>It seems she had a visitor.</i>

39:23.720 --> 39:26.680
<i>That's Liza Varnham.
Did they leave together?</i>

39:26.680 --> 39:32.720
<i>No. She leaves alone,
and Julie leaves at 8.07.</i>

39:32.720 --> 39:35.680
<i>We pick her up at the end
of the road walking towards town,</i>

39:35.680 --> 39:37.080
<i>then we lose sight of her.</i>

39:37.080 --> 39:39.560
<i>Did you find any cameras
on Halton Way?</i>

39:39.560 --> 39:42.000
<i>Yeah, but she's not on any of them.</i>

39:42.000 --> 39:44.800
<i>There's a pedestrian gate
on the other end of the park.</i>

39:44.800 --> 39:47.080
<i>She and whoever she was with
must've used that.</i>

39:47.080 --> 39:50.360
<i>Seems Liza Varnham's
got some questions to answer.</i>

40:12.880 --> 40:14.600
<i>Hello?
Hello.</i>

40:14.600 --> 40:17.520
<i>Can I help you?
I'm trying to trace my brother.</i>

40:17.520 --> 40:19.200
<i>Luke. Luke Marbury?</i>

40:19.200 --> 40:22.240
<i>He worked here on and off,
a long time ago. And?</i>

40:22.240 --> 40:24.360
<i>Well, it's just that somebody said
that, er,</i>

40:24.360 --> 40:25.880
<i>he was seen in the area recently.</i>

40:25.880 --> 40:28.760
<i>You might be able to remember him
from this picture?</i>

40:28.760 --> 40:30.360
<i>I might be getting on a bit,</i>

40:30.360 --> 40:33.840
<i>but there's nothing wrong
with my memory.</i>

40:33.840 --> 40:35.360
<i>You'd better come in.</i>

40:43.040 --> 40:47.640
<i>When kids like Luke turned up,
they got fed, bed for the night,</i>

40:47.640 --> 40:50.000
<i>no questions asked. Sit down.</i>

40:51.520 --> 40:54.600
<i>Some of them'd steal the fat off
your bacon.</i>

40:54.600 --> 40:58.000
<i>But he never messed me about.
I liked him.</i>

40:58.000 --> 41:01.120
<i>He liked you, too, which is why we
thought he might've looked you up.</i>

41:01.120 --> 41:03.920
<i>Well, he didn't.</i>

41:05.360 --> 41:07.520
<i>Did he ever mention
what brought him up here?</i>

41:07.520 --> 41:09.760
<i>He was very young
to be living away from home.</i>

41:09.760 --> 41:12.640
<i>No. And I didn't want to know.</i>

41:12.640 --> 41:15.560
<i>This isn't a kind of place
you ask too many questions.</i>

41:16.880 --> 41:18.640
<i>Most of the kids that came here,</i>

41:18.640 --> 41:22.000
<i>this was the closest thing to family
they ever had.</i>

41:22.000 --> 41:25.440
<i>We looked out for them.
Made 'em feel safe.</i>

41:26.760 --> 41:30.120
<i>Yeah, Luke said he was coming up
here the last time he was seen.</i>

41:31.240 --> 41:32.400
<i>What are you saying?</i>

41:32.400 --> 41:35.840
<i>Nothing. Only that this was
his last known destination.</i>

41:35.840 --> 41:38.280
<i>He might very well have said that.</i>

41:38.280 --> 41:44.800
<i>But just like I told the police all
those years ago, he never arrived.</i>

41:51.320 --> 41:52.920
<i>I'm sorry, Eve,</i>

41:52.920 --> 41:55.400
<i>but I think we're gonna have to
face the distinct possibility</i>

41:55.400 --> 41:57.840
<i>that Luke has passed on,</i>

41:57.840 --> 42:01.080
<i>and that somebody
wants us to believe otherwise.</i>

42:01.080 --> 42:02.560
<i>Why would someone do that?</i>

42:02.560 --> 42:03.640
<i>I have no idea.</i>

42:04.680 --> 42:07.360
<i>I can't help thinking that your
arrival is some kind of trigger.</i>

42:07.360 --> 42:10.240
<i>I'd be surprised if
it wasn't connected in some way,</i>

42:10.240 --> 42:13.240
<i>but I've got to find out
who made that call.</i>

42:15.040 --> 42:16.360
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

42:19.560 --> 42:22.080
<i>That I need more time
to process it all.</i>

42:22.080 --> 42:23.520
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:24.560 --> 42:27.400
<i>We could always stop by my place
on the way back if you'd like?</i>

42:30.240 --> 42:31.840
<i>I'd like that.</i>

42:57.160 --> 42:58.760
<i>You OK?</i>

42:58.760 --> 43:03.120
<i>It's just sad
that Luke felt so lost,</i>

43:03.120 --> 43:05.040
<i>so cut off from his own family</i>

43:05.040 --> 43:07.360
<i>that he had to go all the way out
there to feel he belonged.</i>

43:10.040 --> 43:13.000
<i>Neither of us really knew
what family was.</i>

43:14.960 --> 43:19.120
<i>Which is why, when my husband
told me he didn't want kids,</i>

43:19.120 --> 43:20.840
<i>I went along with it.</i>

43:20.840 --> 43:22.280
<i>Hmm.</i>

43:22.280 --> 43:24.560
<i>That and being terrified
I'd turn out like my mother.</i>

43:24.560 --> 43:27.000
<i>THEY CHUCKLE</i>

43:27.000 --> 43:30.600
<i>Yeah, well, I...
I didn't think I wanted kids,</i>

43:30.600 --> 43:35.440
<i>but then when Ella came along,
it was the best thing that happened.</i>

43:36.600 --> 43:40.240
<i>At the time,
it didn't feel like a sacrifice.</i>

43:40.240 --> 43:43.000
<i>Because I was loved, unconditionally.</i>

43:43.000 --> 43:45.800
<i>And that's all I ever wanted, really.</i>

43:47.680 --> 43:52.400
<i>Then one day, he told me he had
a lover who was six months pregnant</i>

43:52.400 --> 43:53.920
<i>and he was leaving me.</i>

43:53.920 --> 43:55.440
<i>Wow.</i>

43:55.440 --> 43:57.680
<i>And just like that,
I'm back at square one,</i>

43:57.680 --> 44:01.320
<i>with no-one who loves me,
no-one to belong to,</i>

44:01.320 --> 44:03.720
<i>no real connection to anyone.</i>

44:05.720 --> 44:06.920
<i>Oh, Eve.</i>

44:08.280 --> 44:09.760
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

44:12.480 --> 44:13.880
<i>Yeah...</i>

44:17.480 --> 44:19.640
<i>...I know how that feels.</i>

44:24.320 --> 44:25.840
<i>What happened, Alex?</i>

44:32.200 --> 44:34.480
<i>There was a fire at the house.</i>

44:37.240 --> 44:39.440
<i>By the time I got there...</i>

44:41.280 --> 44:43.480
<i>...it was too late.</i>

44:45.120 --> 44:46.800
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

44:46.800 --> 44:49.760
<i>It was started deliberately.</i>

44:52.120 --> 44:54.520
<i>I was the target, but...</i>

44:57.440 --> 45:00.600
<i>Have you... talked to anyone?</i>

45:01.760 --> 45:04.120
<i>Well, you know,
they offered me counselling</i>

45:04.120 --> 45:06.520
<i>and all that kind of thing,
but what's the point?</i>

45:06.520 --> 45:08.280
<i>It might help.</i>

45:08.280 --> 45:09.560
<i>How?</i>

45:15.440 --> 45:17.640
<i>I've lost everything.</i>

45:20.640 --> 45:23.080
<i>I've lost my family, and...</i>

45:25.720 --> 45:30.720
<i>...I've lost everything that...
made any sense.</i>

45:42.080 --> 45:44.080
<i>We just have a couple of questions.</i>

45:44.080 --> 45:45.200
<i>What's this about?</i>

45:45.200 --> 45:47.800
<i>This person called
at Julie Conway's house</i>

45:47.800 --> 45:49.960
<i>three hours after your meeting.</i>

45:49.960 --> 45:52.040
<i>We were wondering
if you recognise her.</i>

45:54.320 --> 45:56.360
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

45:56.360 --> 45:58.240
<i>But you told us
you didn't contact Julie.</i>

45:58.240 --> 45:59.840
<i>What was you doing there,
Ms Varnham?</i>

46:01.040 --> 46:05.320
<i>I made her an offer, for Ravenstoop,
but she refused.</i>

46:05.320 --> 46:10.600
<i>I thought she wanted more money but
she said she'd never sell it to me.</i>

46:10.600 --> 46:12.720
<i>And how did that make you feel?</i>

46:12.720 --> 46:16.320
<i>Angry. Anybody would be.</i>

46:16.320 --> 46:18.680
<i>As angry as you were when you saw
Julie here at the house</i>

46:18.680 --> 46:20.280
<i>with your father?</i>

46:21.400 --> 46:24.560
<i>You see, I know that, because your
brother told us that you called him</i>

46:24.560 --> 46:28.680
<i>in a rage, demanding that he keep
"evil" Julie away from your father.</i>

46:28.680 --> 46:31.400
<i>Why are you lying to us, Ms Varnham?</i>

46:34.080 --> 46:37.960
<i>I can't talk for long, because,
er, I'm on air in ten minutes,</i>

46:37.960 --> 46:39.760
<i>but this is where the magic happens.</i>

46:39.760 --> 46:41.960
<i>Wow! Yeah. Who funds all this?</i>

46:41.960 --> 46:45.000
<i>Oh, erm, you know grants. Trusts.
Public donations.</i>

46:45.000 --> 46:47.480
<i>It's run by the community
for the community.</i>

46:47.480 --> 46:50.720
<i>It's all volunteers like me.
Yeah. So listen, Ray,</i>

46:50.720 --> 46:53.280
<i>I was wondering if you had
a call log I could look at?</i>

46:53.280 --> 46:55.320
<i>Oh, yeah, of course. Through here.</i>

46:56.480 --> 47:00.840
<i>Yeah. This is the one
that come in after the appeal.</i>

47:00.840 --> 47:02.640
<i>9.47.</i>

47:02.640 --> 47:03.920
<i>During a music break.</i>

47:03.920 --> 47:05.640
<i>He didn't wanna be on air.</i>

47:05.640 --> 47:07.200
<i>Right. And did you take the call?</i>

47:07.200 --> 47:09.960
<i>I did. All the hosts
run their own shows.</i>

47:09.960 --> 47:11.760
<i>Oh, right. And you have no idea
who it was?</i>

47:11.760 --> 47:14.840
<i>Well, it wasn't one of my regulars,
so no. What's this about?</i>

47:14.840 --> 47:17.360
<i>Oh, no, it's just that the caller
said they saw Luke Marbury</i>

47:17.360 --> 47:20.280
<i>up, er, you know, two months ago,
in a pub up in Craydale</i>

47:20.280 --> 47:21.920
<i>that's been shut for over a year.</i>

47:21.920 --> 47:24.600
<i>Oh. I'm only the messenger.</i>

47:24.600 --> 47:27.360
<i>There's plenty of crazies out there.</i>

47:30.600 --> 47:34.520
<i>This must be hell for his sister.
Would you give her my best?</i>

47:34.520 --> 47:37.840
<i>Yeah, of course, yeah. Thanks, Ray.
All right, yeah.</i>

47:43.440 --> 47:44.960
<i>I'll have a look now for you.</i>

47:44.960 --> 47:47.960
<i>All right. Cheers, Darren.</i>

47:47.960 --> 47:51.360
<i>Ah! So you are alive!
I've been calling you all day.</i>

47:51.360 --> 47:54.880
<i>Yeah. I was chasing up that sighting
in Craydale.</i>

47:54.880 --> 47:57.760
<i>What, you went to Craydale?
Why didn't you tell me?</i>

47:57.760 --> 48:00.920
<i>I took Eve with me.
Thought she'd be useful, you know.</i>

48:00.920 --> 48:04.160
<i>She knew the place,
people that Luke used to mix with.</i>

48:05.760 --> 48:08.920
<i>Why didn't you pick up?
Signal's terrible up there.</i>

48:11.680 --> 48:13.120
<i>And?</i>

48:14.280 --> 48:18.640
<i>The call was a hoax. There's no way
that pub was open two months ago.</i>

48:18.640 --> 48:21.400
<i>Ah. So someone's playing us,
and they're not the only one.</i>

48:21.400 --> 48:24.280
<i>Liza Varnham claims that the reason
she lied to us</i>

48:24.280 --> 48:26.920
<i>is to avoid us
pointing the finger at her,</i>

48:26.920 --> 48:28.640
<i>but I... I'm not sure I believe her.</i>

48:30.600 --> 48:33.200
<i>What is it? What have you found?</i>

48:33.200 --> 48:36.640
<i>All right, so, on the left
are the letters Julie sent to Jed,</i>

48:36.640 --> 48:39.200
<i>and on the right are the letters
that Luke sent to Eve.</i>

48:39.200 --> 48:42.080
<i>Well, the handwriting looks similar.
I'd say they look identical.</i>

48:42.080 --> 48:45.880
<i>So you think the letters from Luke
to Eve were written by Julie Conway?</i>

48:45.880 --> 48:48.560
<i>I'd say we need an expert
to confirm it,</i>

48:48.560 --> 48:51.120
<i>but it all ties in with those
fake sightings up in Craydale.</i>

48:51.120 --> 48:53.960
<i>A lot of information
designed to mislead us.</i>

48:53.960 --> 48:55.920
<i>But the hoax caller was a man.</i>

48:55.920 --> 48:59.040
<i>Which tells me that Julie
isn't the only person out there</i>

48:59.040 --> 49:02.280
<i>who wants us to believe
that Luke Marbury is still alive.</i>

49:02.280 --> 49:04.240
<i>We need to find that MisPer file.</i>

49:04.240 --> 49:06.800
<i>I'll get Darren back on to it. Yeah.</i>

49:06.800 --> 49:10.760
<i>Jed Varnham, him and Julie
were an item years ago.</i>

49:10.760 --> 49:13.720
<i>He must know something
about Luke's relationship with her.</i>

49:13.720 --> 49:15.280
<i>So why don't we ask him?</i>

49:15.280 --> 49:17.080
<i>Let's do it.</i>

49:18.040 --> 49:21.440
<i>Does the name Luke Marbury
mean anything to you, Jed?</i>

49:21.440 --> 49:23.960
<i>He went missing about 1989,
up at Allerton.</i>

49:25.680 --> 49:29.800
<i>Luke wrote his sister letters over
the years to let her know he was OK.</i>

49:29.800 --> 49:31.800
<i>And what has this got to do with me?</i>

49:31.800 --> 49:35.040
<i>Well, Luke and Julie were friends
as teenagers.</i>

49:36.160 --> 49:38.160
<i>I didn't even know Julie then.</i>

49:38.160 --> 49:40.480
<i>The letters were written
over a period of time</i>

49:40.480 --> 49:42.320
<i>that you two were in a relationship.</i>

49:42.320 --> 49:46.120
<i>And we've now reason to believe
that Luke didn't write the letters.</i>

49:46.120 --> 49:47.680
<i>The letters were written by Julie.</i>

49:47.680 --> 49:50.680
<i>What? Why would she do that?</i>

49:50.680 --> 49:53.120
<i>We thought you might know.</i>

49:53.120 --> 49:54.920
<i>Well, I don't.</i>

49:56.200 --> 49:58.600
<i>Never even heard of Luke Marbury.</i>

49:58.600 --> 50:02.240
<i>And as far as I know,
Julie never wrote him any letters.</i>

50:14.080 --> 50:18.480
<i>'It's all the rich incomers,
Ray, happy to pay silly money.</i>

50:18.480 --> 50:21.240
<i>'My grandchildren
can't even afford to buy a shed</i>

50:21.240 --> 50:24.040
<i>'in the town they grew up in.
It's a total disgrace.'</i>

50:24.040 --> 50:25.520
<i>Thanks, Mary.</i>

50:27.240 --> 50:31.680
<i>See, there's a view
shared by a lot of you this evening.</i>

50:31.680 --> 50:37.000
<i>I remember a time when
this town were a community of people</i>

50:37.000 --> 50:42.080
<i>who'd lived here for generations.
The world's gone mad, my friends.</i>

50:42.080 --> 50:45.320
<i>Let's see if our next caller agrees.</i>

50:45.320 --> 50:48.360
<i>What's your name
and where are you calling from?</i>

50:48.360 --> 50:50.560
<i>'My name's Luke.</i>

50:50.560 --> 50:52.920
<i>'And you know exactly where I am.'</i>

50:55.320 --> 50:57.040
<i>And what do you wanna say, Luke?</i>

50:57.040 --> 50:58.800
<i>'I think you know, Ray.</i>

50:58.800 --> 51:01.680
<i>'Why don't you share it
with everyone?</i>

51:01.680 --> 51:04.000
<i>'Get it off your chest.</i>

51:04.000 --> 51:07.200
<i>'If you don't, I will.'</i>

51:07.200 --> 51:09.240
<i>DIAL TONE</i>

51:16.400 --> 51:18.280
<i>BUZZER</i>

51:18.280 --> 51:21.400
<i>DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE</i>

51:27.520 --> 51:29.720
<i>Thanks for coming, Ridley.</i>

51:29.720 --> 51:32.520
<i>Yeah. Your call sounded very urgent.</i>

51:33.760 --> 51:35.480
<i>I've had some bad news.</i>

51:35.480 --> 51:36.880
<i>It's Mum.</i>

51:38.280 --> 51:40.800
<i>Doc-Doctor says she's dying.</i>

51:40.800 --> 51:42.680
<i>Stomach cancer.</i>

51:42.680 --> 51:44.680
<i>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

51:44.680 --> 51:46.760
<i>She were always there for me.</i>

51:46.760 --> 51:50.440
<i>No matter what.
Supported me through thick and thin.</i>

51:50.440 --> 51:52.040
<i>I-I need to see her, Ridley.</i>

51:54.520 --> 51:57.520
<i>If you were a Category B prisoner, maybe,</i>

51:57.520 --> 51:59.400
<i>but you're Category A, not a chance.</i>

51:59.400 --> 52:04.080
<i>There must be some-some
special licence I could apply for.</i>

52:04.080 --> 52:05.840
<i>I mean, you-you could put a word in.</i>

52:06.880 --> 52:09.360
<i>Can't change the rules.
Even if I wanted to.</i>

52:10.560 --> 52:13.760
<i>But you don't... want to.</i>

52:13.760 --> 52:16.920
<i>I didn't say that. It is what it is.</i>

52:16.920 --> 52:20.520
<i>Half an hour. That's all I'm asking.</i>

52:20.520 --> 52:25.320
<i>It might be the last time I see her.
Our kid's vulnerable. You know that.</i>

52:25.320 --> 52:28.160
<i>Needs-needs me to explain what's
going on otherwise he'll lose it,</i>

52:28.160 --> 52:30.120
<i>and-and Mum's got no-one else.</i>

52:30.120 --> 52:31.520
<i>Look, there's nothing I can do.</i>

52:31.520 --> 52:34.680
<i>But he won't be coping, Ridley,
and-and neither am I!</i>

52:34.680 --> 52:38.600
<i>Stuck in here when
my whole family's been blown apart.</i>

52:46.440 --> 52:50.200
<i>BUZZER</i>

52:50.200 --> 52:52.560
<i>Now you know how I feel.</i>

52:56.840 --> 52:58.280
<i>DOOR SLAMS</i>

53:04.160 --> 53:05.400
<i>RINGING</i>

53:05.400 --> 53:06.840
<i>Ooh!</i>

53:11.440 --> 53:13.360
<i>Eve, you all right?</i>

53:13.360 --> 53:16.720
<i>Alex, are you free tomorrow night?</i>

53:16.720 --> 53:18.800
<i>It's just that Jamie and the lads
have, erm,</i>

53:18.800 --> 53:22.960
<i>have asked me to sing again at
Marlings, and I'd love you to come.</i>

53:24.320 --> 53:26.080
<i>Yeah, then I shall be there.</i>

53:26.080 --> 53:28.840
<i>That's great. That's great.</i>

53:28.840 --> 53:30.720
<i>See you then.</i>

53:41.400 --> 53:45.360
<i>Tech got a result
on Ray Trevice's phone records.</i>

53:45.360 --> 53:47.640
<i>There was no call to that number
at 9.47.</i>

53:47.640 --> 53:49.160
<i>But I saw it on the log.</i>

53:49.160 --> 53:52.200
<i>According to them, it was
manually altered the following day.</i>

53:52.200 --> 53:54.320
<i>It looks like Ray is our hoaxer.</i>

53:54.320 --> 53:55.800
<i>Really?!</i>

53:55.800 --> 53:57.040
<i>And listen to this.</i>

53:57.040 --> 54:01.080
<i>'What's your name
and where are you calling from?</i>

54:01.080 --> 54:05.120
<i>'My name's Luke.
And you know exactly where I am.</i>

54:05.120 --> 54:06.960
<i>'What do you wanna say, Luke?</i>

54:06.960 --> 54:08.240
<i>'I think you know, Ray.</i>

54:08.240 --> 54:11.680
<i>'Why don't you share it with
everyone? Get it off your chest.</i>

54:11.680 --> 54:13.560
<i>'If you don't, I will.'</i>

54:15.960 --> 54:18.920
<i>Tech traced the number.
It's Duncan Darwin.</i>

54:18.920 --> 54:21.600
<i>Look, I've told Mr Ridley
everything that I know.</i>

54:22.800 --> 54:25.760
<i>So why were you
on Ray Trevice's show last night</i>

54:25.760 --> 54:27.680
<i>pretending to be Luke Marbury?</i>

54:31.160 --> 54:33.080
<i>Not here.</i>

54:34.960 --> 54:38.840
<i>Ray Trevice... isn't the man
you think he is -</i>

54:38.840 --> 54:41.320
<i>Mr Community Radio,
everybody's best mate.</i>

54:42.440 --> 54:43.800
<i>Who is he, then?</i>

54:43.800 --> 54:45.760
<i>SIGHS</i>

54:47.640 --> 54:50.280
<i>Someone you'd never want
anywhere near your kids.</i>

54:55.400 --> 54:56.800
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

54:59.000 --> 55:03.640
<i>Ray's shop was a mecca for teenagers
back in the day.</i>

55:04.600 --> 55:08.040
<i>Everybody idolised him,
which is just the way he wanted it.</i>

55:08.040 --> 55:09.120
<i>VOICE BREAKS Sorry.</i>

55:09.120 --> 55:11.880
<i>It's OK, Duncan. Take your time.</i>

55:14.600 --> 55:17.960
<i>First it was free records,
then it was parties above the shop.</i>

55:20.320 --> 55:23.240
<i>He used to measure kids on the wall,
see who was tallest, shortest,</i>

55:23.240 --> 55:25.680
<i>who'd grown the most,
like he was everybody's fun dad.</i>

55:25.680 --> 55:27.960
<i>But it was just...</i>

55:27.960 --> 55:30.000
<i>an excuse...</i>

55:31.320 --> 55:33.600
<i>...to get a bit closer.</i>

55:36.640 --> 55:38.800
<i>He chose his victims well.</i>

55:40.840 --> 55:43.720
<i>Troubled. Neglected.</i>

55:45.320 --> 55:46.680
<i>Julie Conway.</i>

55:49.760 --> 55:52.320
<i>I tried to warn her,
but she wouldn't listen.</i>

55:52.320 --> 55:53.640
<i>She-She liked the attention.</i>

55:53.640 --> 55:57.440
<i>Ray acted like
it was all normal behaviour.</i>

55:59.160 --> 56:01.880
<i>Did Luke Marbury
go to any of these parties?</i>

56:03.480 --> 56:05.480
<i>Julie got him involved.</i>

56:06.480 --> 56:09.280
<i>And now she's dead,
and Ray's walking around scot-free</i>

56:09.280 --> 56:11.120
<i>like none of it ever happened.</i>

56:12.800 --> 56:14.160
<i>Duncan...</i>

56:16.320 --> 56:19.840
<i>...when I showed you
that photo of Julie,</i>

56:19.840 --> 56:22.120
<i>you said you didn't know her.</i>

56:24.680 --> 56:29.840
<i>I've never told anyone
about any of this.</i>

56:29.840 --> 56:32.360
<i>Not even my wife.</i>

56:41.560 --> 56:44.360
<i>But when I heard
what happened to Julie...</i>

56:46.920 --> 56:49.000
<i>...I knew it was time.</i>

56:49.000 --> 56:51.920
<i>Do you think Ray's
got something to do with her death?</i>

56:55.320 --> 56:58.960
<i>You were asking questions about
Luke. Ray wouldn't have liked that.</i>

57:01.680 --> 57:04.760
<i>He'd wanna make sure
that Julie kept her mouth shut.</i>

57:04.760 --> 57:07.240
<i>Her drinking made her a liability.</i>

57:07.240 --> 57:12.000
<i>RINGING</i>

57:15.800 --> 57:17.840
<i>Look, I've got to pick
my daughter up.</i>

57:17.840 --> 57:21.080
<i>I never let her walk anywhere
on her own. Thank you.</i>

57:42.720 --> 57:45.720
<i>Right, well, I've rang him
five times. He's left us no option.</i>

57:45.720 --> 57:48.240
<i>I can't go in without a warrant.
No, but I can.</i>

57:55.760 --> 57:56.920
<i>Ray?</i>

58:04.240 --> 58:05.560
<i>Ray?</i>

58:15.360 --> 58:16.960
<i>Ridley?</i>

58:18.520 --> 58:20.840
<i>This ties in with
Duncan's statement.</i>

58:23.200 --> 58:24.400
<i>Right.</i>

58:50.760 --> 58:52.520
<i>Look at these.</i>

58:52.520 --> 58:54.760
<i>These kids are Jack's age.</i>

59:00.280 --> 59:01.800
<i>That's Julie Conway.</i>

59:05.080 --> 59:08.000
<i>What? Look. His phone.</i>

59:08.000 --> 59:11.400
<i>Right, let's see where he is.</i>

59:11.400 --> 59:12.640
<i>Raymond?</i>

59:14.680 --> 59:16.080
<i>Ray?</i>

59:21.080 --> 59:23.560
<i>CRACKLING</i>

59:29.320 --> 59:30.760
<i>Where's Darren?</i>

59:30.760 --> 59:32.160
<i>I've been trying to call him.</i>

59:32.160 --> 59:34.040
<i>I think we're gonna have to start
without him.</i>

59:34.040 --> 59:35.560
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

59:35.560 --> 59:38.080
<i>OK. Good morning, everyone.</i>

59:38.080 --> 59:39.760
<i>If you'd like to open your files.</i>

59:44.640 --> 59:48.920
<i>So, yesterday, Ridley and I
found this man, Ray Trevice,</i>

59:48.920 --> 59:53.320
<i>dead in the flat above
his record shop. He'd hung himself.</i>

59:53.320 --> 59:56.960
<i>Earlier that day, we'd obtained
information from a Duncan Darwin</i>

59:56.960 --> 59:58.200
<i>that led us there.</i>

59:58.200 --> 1:00:03.280
<i>Duncan gave us a detailed, and it
has to be said, harrowing account</i>

1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:04.960
<i>of Ray Trevice's involvement</i>

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:09.000
<i>in the historic serial abuse
of vulnerable teenagers.</i>

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.960
<i>What period was this?</i>

1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:13.760
<i>According to Darwin, he was
most active in the mid to late '80s.</i>

1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:15.280
<i>And we're sure he's reliable?</i>

1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:17.840
<i>Oh, yeah, we've found
photographs and evidence</i>

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:20.360
<i>in Trevice's flat
that back up Duncan's statement.</i>

1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:23.840
<i>How does this relate
to our murder case?</i>

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:27.200
<i>Well, Julie Conway can be seen
in several of the photographs,</i>

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:30.000
<i>and she can indeed be seen with
Ray Trevice himself in some of them.</i>

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.920
<i>Duncan Darwin is also present,
as is Luke Marbury.</i>

1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:39.920
<i>Why would Ray Trevice
kill Julie Conway now?</i>

1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:43.520
<i>Well, when Ridley started
asking questions about Luke Marbury,</i>

1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:44.680
<i>it unnerved him.</i>

1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:48.640
<i>It would be reasonable
to assume that Ray Trevice</i>

1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:50.960
<i>needed to ensure that
she would keep her mouth shut.</i>

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.040
<i>Good work, Carol.</i>

1:00:56.040 --> 1:00:59.000
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.760
<i>Looks like we've found our man.</i>

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.360
<i>Yeah, but we also found
incriminating photographs</i>

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:06.960
<i>of Julie Conway in another location.</i>

1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:09.320
<i>Ray Trevice may not be
the only person involved.</i>

1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:10.760
<i>Hang on. Hang on there, Ridley.</i>

1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:12.800
<i>Before we start
expanding the search,</i>

1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:14.800
<i>we need to target
our limited resources</i>

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:17.800
<i>on nailing Ray Trevice
as Julie Conway's killer.</i>

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:20.640
<i>What, pause all other
lines of enquiry?</i>

1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:22.480
<i>For now, yes.</i>

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:11.440
<i>Ridley?</i>

1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:13.040
<i>Come over here a sec.</i>

1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:18.920
<i>So finally heard back
from the Varnham's solicitor.</i>

1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:22.040
<i>It turns out that Julian Varnham's
will hasn't been amended</i>

1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:23.280
<i>since 1989.</i>

1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:27.640
<i>So Julie Conway was always
gonna inherit that house.</i>

1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:29.600
<i>Boss.
Darren, where have you been?</i>

1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:32.600
<i>In the Archives. I found
Luke Marbury's MisPer report.</i>

1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:34.800
<i>Oh. Where?</i>

1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:39.600
<i>Concealed in a box of RTAs
from 1989. Signed out by a DCI.</i>

1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:43.200
<i>So it was deliberately misfiled?</i>

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:44.760
<i>And here's why.</i>

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:50.440
<i>The day before he went missing,
Luke Marbury came in to this station</i>

1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:54.160
<i>to make a serious complaint
against Julian Varnham.</i>

1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:00.920
<i>Ridley!</i>

1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:03.000
<i>Come on.</i>

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.240
<i>Ridley! Wait!</i>

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:07.160
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:12.200
<i>Julian Varnham gave Ravenstoop
to Julie Conway in 1989,</i>

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:15.000
<i>the same year that Luke Marbury
went missing.</i>

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.120
<i>I am convinced that that house
is central to this case</i>

1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:22.040
<i>and that Duncan knows a lot more
than he's letting on.</i>

1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:24.560
<i>OK. I'm coming with you.
What about Goodwin?</i>

1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:26.080
<i>We got a new lead.</i>

1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:29.000
<i>I wouldn't be doing my job if I
didn't follow it up. You have it.</i>

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.720
<i>'Right, Duncan, let's go
and get in the car. Come on.'</i>

1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:33.200
<i>Why? I've done nothing wrong.</i>

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:35.080
<i>All right. We can do it here
if you want?</i>

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:47.560
<i>So, Duncan...</i>

1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:51.280
<i>...tell us about the house.</i>

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.120
<i>What house?</i>

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:54.640
<i>Ravenstoop.</i>

1:03:56.360 --> 1:03:58.400
<i>I don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:00.080
<i>We think you do.</i>

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:03.320
<i>Were you really the last person
to see Luke Marbury alive</i>

1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:04.840
<i>or was it Julian Varnham?</i>

1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:07.880
<i>The story doesn't end with Ray
Trevice, does it? You lied to us.</i>

1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.360
<i>Did you do it to cover your tracks?</i>

1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.440
<i>No.</i>

1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:15.240
<i>You needed to silence Julie and Ray,
didn't you?</i>

1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:16.880
<i>Stop the truth from coming out.</i>

1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:20.480
<i>No... I told... you.</i>

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:22.040
<i>Then what?</i>

1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:29.200
<i>I was the last person to see Luke,
but not how you think.</i>

1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:33.920
<i>Start the car.</i>

1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:59.800
<i>Doesn't look like
a much-loved family heirloom.</i>

1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:03.560
<i>Let's, er, try the back.</i>

1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:25.600
<i>I'll pretend I didn't see that.</i>

1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:37.120
<i>LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS</i>

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:03.520
<i>Ooh! It's cold in here, in't it?</i>

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:06.200
<i>Very cold.</i>

1:06:30.040 --> 1:06:32.200
<i>I'm going upstairs, yeah?
Yeah.</i>

1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:05.160
<i>What is this place?</i>

1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:07.800
<i>This is
every parent's worst nightmare.</i>

1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:11.200
<i>This is the bed in the photograph.</i>

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:15.160
<i>Julie Conway sat right here.</i>

1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:19.320
<i>Where's Duncan?</i>

1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:22.920
<i>Duncan?</i>

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.960
<i>Duncan?</i>

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.240
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:32.600
<i>What's going on here?</i>

1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:42.000
<i>You wanted to find Luke.</i>

1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:03.880
<i>THEY COUGH</i>

1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:17.200
<i>You've been arrested on suspicion
of the murder of Julie Conway.</i>

1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:18.960
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:20.920
<i>I already told you, it wasn't me.</i>

1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:25.040
<i>Just answer the question.</i>

1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:27.680
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:31.560
<i>How did you first come in contact
with Julian Varnham?</i>

1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:36.480
<i>We knew him as JV. Never Julian.</i>

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:40.440
<i>Reckon it was a way
of distancing himself.</i>

1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:43.880
<i>Didn't like getting his hands dirty.</i>

1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:47.360
<i>Ray was the middle man.</i>

1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:49.840
<i>Got kids to trust him</i>

1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:52.560
<i>then brought them to Ravenstoop.</i>

1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:55.760
<i>So Ray wasn't actively involved
with the abuse?</i>

1:08:55.760 --> 1:08:56.960
<i>No.</i>

1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:01.720
<i>Ray was just a sleaze.
Idolised JV.</i>

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:04.840
<i>Did whatever it took
to stay in his good books.</i>

1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:07.240
<i>And he recruited Julie Conway?</i>

1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:10.960
<i>How did that work?</i>

1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:16.080
<i>She'd hang out at JV's venues,</i>

1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:18.040
<i>the ones that attracted
an underage crowd...</i>

1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:23.160
<i>...and she'd get them pissed
and invite them to a party.</i>

1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:25.200
<i>Were you at these parties?</i>

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:33.600
<i>Nothing happened at the start.</i>

1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:37.920
<i>JV needed to build our trust...</i>

1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:43.280
<i>...make sure no-one
was looking out for us.</i>

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:49.200
<i>Then he'd spike our drinks...</i>

1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:54.800
<i>...wait till we were all out of it...</i>

1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:00.080
<i>...and then he...</i>

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:01.120
<i>HE BREATHES HEAVILY</i>

1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:11.360
<i>He did whatever he wanted,
and he got away with it</i>

1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:15.640
<i>because JV had friends in
high places who always had his back.</i>

1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:22.600
<i>That's how he knew that Luke
had made a complaint to the police?</i>

1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:31.240
<i>But Luke went back to Ravenstoop.
Why?</i>

1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:34.960
<i>Julie tricked him into coming.</i>

1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:40.880
<i>Told... Told him JV was away
for the night.</i>

1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:46.880
<i>But he was there, waiting.</i>

1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:52.480
<i>No-one ever crossed JV.</i>

1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:54.200
<i>Ever.</i>

1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:57.880
<i>But Luke wasn't like the rest of us.</i>

1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:59.840
<i>He was brave.</i>

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:02.360
<i>Stood up for himself.</i>

1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:07.560
<i>Told JV that
if the police didn't do anything...</i>

1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:11.080
<i>...he was gonna tell the papers.</i>

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:16.760
<i>JV was never gonna let him leave.</i>

1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.320
<i>He came at him with...</i>

1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:27.400
<i>He came at him
with this heavy glass ashtray.</i>

1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:31.200
<i>I can still remember the sound of it
smashing his skull.</i>

1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:35.440
<i>Why didn't you tell anyone?</i>

1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:38.080
<i>He had videos...</i>

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.160
<i>...and photographs.</i>

1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:46.720
<i>He said he'd show them
to our parents.</i>

1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:51.280
<i>We were so scared
we just went along with it.</i>

1:11:56.720 --> 1:11:58.520
<i>Then what happened?</i>

1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.840
<i>He told us we had to get
our story straight.</i>

1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:12.640
<i>If anyone asked, Luke had done
a runner, and that I'd seen him go.</i>

1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:21.360
<i>Then he got me to carry him down
to the cellar.</i>

1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:26.080
<i>So you were the last person
to see him?</i>

1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:30.040
<i>Oh, he barely weighed anything.</i>

1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:34.000
<i>He was just a kid.</i>

1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:43.960
<i>Goodwin wants us to keep him
in custody</i>

1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:45.920
<i>until the remains
have been identified</i>

1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:47.640
<i>and the cause of death established.</i>

1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:49.560
<i>But Wendy thinks it could be a while yet.</i>

1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:52.320
<i>Well, Goodwin's right. We have
to be one hundred percent sure</i>

1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:55.680
<i>he wasn't involved in either Luke
or Julie's murder.</i>

1:12:55.680 --> 1:12:59.640
<i>Julian Varnham's funeral's tomorrow.
How do we handle that?</i>

1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:03.480
<i>Hang fire until Duncan's statement
is corroborated.</i>

1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:06.800
<i>I've got to see Eve this evening.
So if you need me here or...</i>

1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:09.960
<i>No, no. We're done here.
What are you gonna tell her?</i>

1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:12.680
<i>Nothing. Till we know for sure.</i>

1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:16.880
<i>JAZZ</i>

1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:46.360
<i>You OK?</i>

1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:47.920
<i>Yeah, no, I'm... fine, yeah.</i>

1:13:47.920 --> 1:13:50.160
<i>Just had a bit of a long day,
that's all.</i>

1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:53.200
<i>Any news on Luke?</i>

1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:58.160
<i>Yeah, I-I think we're getting closer
to an answer on Luke.</i>

1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:02.120
<i>I'm not sure anymore
that I want you to.</i>

1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:07.840
<i>I found it harder than I thought,
stirring up the past.</i>

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:10.840
<i>I just want to go home now.</i>

1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:17.000
<i>Home. So... this doesn't feel
like home anymore?</i>

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.000
<i>I thought it might, but it doesn't.</i>

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.400
<i>Not without my brother.</i>

1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:26.560
<i>So I'm leaving after the funeral.</i>

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:29.600
<i>Really? What, so soon?</i>

1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:35.120
<i>You could come with me?</i>

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:38.960
<i>Oh, what, to the States?</i>

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:42.000
<i>Well, why not?
We're both a bit lost.</i>

1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:46.560
<i>I'm singing at Jacksonville in
two weeks. You would love it there.</i>

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:48.720
<i>Yeah. I bet, yeah.</i>

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:53.400
<i>I think we could be good
for each other, Alex.</i>

1:14:54.400 --> 1:14:56.280
<i>I'm not asking you to marry me.</i>

1:14:56.280 --> 1:15:00.560
<i>I'm-I'm just saying,
I'm not ready for this to end.</i>

1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:02.760
<i>Whatever this is.</i>

1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:07.400
<i>But maybe that's just me. No.</i>

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:12.280
<i>No, no, really, it's not.</i>

1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:13.920
<i>So...</i>

1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:17.480
<i>...come with me.</i>

1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:43.520
<i>Is it time to move on
like everybody says I should?</i>

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:47.400
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:52.600
<i>I had everything I ever wanted.</i>

1:15:55.040 --> 1:15:57.280
<i>Maybe I should be just happy
with that.</i>

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:02.240
<i>So, are you gonna stay
on your own forever, then?</i>

1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:22.360
<i>As you can see there's evidence
of cranial blunt force trauma.</i>

1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:25.080
<i>Now, a depression fracture like that</i>

1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:27.720
<i>is typically the result
of some kind of high energy impact,</i>

1:16:27.720 --> 1:16:31.320
<i>which ties in with
the witness report of the victim</i>

1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:33.720
<i>being hit repeatedly
with a heavy glass object.</i>

1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:36.440
<i>Are you saying this is Luke Marbury?</i>

1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:39.200
<i>No. I'm saying it's someone
who was beaten over the head</i>

1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:42.120
<i>with considerable force
some years ago.</i>

1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:43.560
<i>I need more than that.</i>

1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:44.880
<i>And I'm going as fast as I can.</i>

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:48.920
<i>OK, is there anything that could
identify him as Luke Marbury?</i>

1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:50.880
<i>Potentially, yes. A watch.</i>

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:53.440
<i>We're getting the serial number
checked out now.</i>

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:55.640
<i>I also managed to retrieve
a couple of strands of hair</i>

1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:57.120
<i>which we're fast tracking for DNA.</i>

1:16:57.120 --> 1:16:58.560
<i>How long will that take?</i>

1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:02.160
<i>Could be hours, could be much
longer than that, I'm afraid.</i>

1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:04.720
<i>SIGHS</i>

1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:06.840
<i>Any news from CSI?</i>

1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:10.000
<i>No, not yet.
Goodwin's doing his nut in.</i>

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.920
<i>Been asked to keep a discreet
presence until we know for sure.</i>

1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:18.920
<i>Well, if it's a yes, the family will
need to know as soon as possible.</i>

1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:20.360
<i>I know.</i>

1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.520
<i>Not looking forward to that one bit.</i>

1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:36.600
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:38.280
<i>There's something I need to do.</i>

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:49.160
<i>ECHOING LAUGHTER</i>

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:50.760
<i>'It's OK. You missed me.'</i>

1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:54.560
<i>Which is just as well as this is the
dress I'm singing in at the funeral.</i>

1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:56.640
<i>What have you got for me, Carol?</i>

1:17:56.640 --> 1:17:58.520
<i>Nothing yet, sir.</i>

1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:00.720
<i>That's Wendy now, though.</i>

1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:03.840
<i>Hiya, Wendy. It's Carol.
I'm with DCI Goodwin.</i>

1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:07.440
<i>Finally got some answers for you.
The watch found with the remains,</i>

1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:12.600
<i>the serial number belongs to a watch
believed to have been stolen in 1988</i>

1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:14.480
<i>by Luke Marbury.</i>

1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:17.480
<i>Ms Marbury returned to the hotel
around 11.</i>

1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:19.080
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

1:18:19.080 --> 1:18:24.240
<i>She'd mislaid her room key so
we issued her another one at 11.07.</i>

1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:25.880
<i>And then she went to her room?</i>

1:18:25.880 --> 1:18:27.680
<i>No. There was someone waiting
for her.</i>

1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:30.120
<i>What about the DNA?</i>

1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:31.600
<i>We managed to extract a DNA sample</i>

1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:33.640
<i>from the strand of hair
found on the body.</i>

1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:36.120
<i>No direct match on the database,</i>

1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:39.280
<i>but it did give us
a more surprising result.</i>

1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:43.440
<i>Turns out it's a fifty percent match
to a DNA sample</i>

1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:46.160
<i>found on a shard of glass at
the scene of Julie Conway's death -</i>

1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:49.920
<i>a percentage shared by
a full sibling.</i>

1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:53.600
<i>So I ran the profile
against a sample given to us</i>

1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:55.480
<i>by Luke Marbury's sister Eve.</i>

1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.520
<i>And it's a match.</i>

1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:14.680
<i>People always associate
my father's success</i>

1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:17.720
<i>with his entertainment venues,</i>

1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:21.520
<i>but the Bursary was the achievement
that he was most proud of.</i>

1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:24.320
<i>Allowing generations of young people
to take up opportunities</i>

1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:26.280
<i>that they couldn't otherwise
have afforded.</i>

1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:29.960
<i>And I'm delighted to say that
we have one of them with us today -</i>

1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:32.120
<i>Eve Marbury,</i>

1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:36.360
<i>whose own life was transformed
by my father's generosity,</i>

1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:42.120
<i>singing one of his favourite songs,
After You've Gone.</i>

1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:55.960
<i>MUSIC STARTS</i>

1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:09.080
<i>MUSIC STOPS</i>

1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:14.080
<i>I can't sing for the man
who killed my brother.</i>

1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:15.120
<i>GASPING</i>

1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:24.080
<i>Julian Varnham chose his victims well.</i>

1:20:24.080 --> 1:20:26.760
<i>Victims like my brother Luke.</i>

1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:31.080
<i>Lost. Vulnerable. Unloved.</i>

1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:37.960
<i>Julian Varnham's real legacy
is the damage he did</i>

1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:40.280
<i>to all those young people,</i>

1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:43.600
<i>leaving them with feelings of shame
and guilt</i>

1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:45.840
<i>from which they never recovered.</i>

1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:49.440
<i>But my brother Luke,</i>

1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:53.440
<i>my 15-year-old brother,</i>

1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:56.760
<i>he was brave</i>

1:20:56.760 --> 1:20:59.760
<i>and he went to the police
to expose the truth,</i>

1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:03.440
<i>but Julian Varnham
has friends in high places</i>

1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:05.200
<i>who made it all disappear.</i>

1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:10.040
<i>And my brother paid for his bravery
with his life.</i>

1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:15.960
<i>And I am so very proud of him.</i>

1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:37.160
<i>I need to speak to her.</i>

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:38.320
<i>Really?</i>

1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:41.200
<i>Yeah. I just need five minutes.</i>

1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:44.480
<i>All right, five minutes.
I'll talk to the family.</i>

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:46.200
<i>Sure.</i>

1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:51.400
<i>Just wait outside.</i>

1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:09.920
<i>How did you know it was me?</i>

1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:17.960
<i>The dress. The dress you wore
to my place that night for dinner.</i>

1:22:19.160 --> 1:22:22.080
<i>You said you'd brought it across
for the funeral.</i>

1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:24.840
<i>When I saw you weren't wearing it,</i>

1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:27.680
<i>I wondered what made you
change your mind.</i>

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:31.800
<i>Then I remembered
something you said.</i>

1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:34.880
<i>You said home just wasn't the same
without your brother...</i>

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:39.440
<i>...like you already knew he was dead.</i>

1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:42.400
<i>Which of course, you did.</i>

1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:46.800
<i>I didn't plan any of this, Alex.
I need you to believe that.</i>

1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:50.240
<i>Julie Conway came to me.</i>

1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:51.800
<i>What?</i>

1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:55.040
<i>Someone she drinks with saw me at
Marlings, knew where I was staying,</i>

1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:58.440
<i>so when I got back from our dinner,
she was there waiting.</i>

1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:02.040
<i>I think Julie saw my return
from the States as a sign,</i>

1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:04.960
<i>the chance to atone
before it was too late.</i>

1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:10.040
<i>I need to talk to you. About Luke.</i>

1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:11.840
<i>Who are you?</i>

1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:15.240
<i>Not here.</i>

1:23:16.680 --> 1:23:21.480
<i>So she told me about Ray Trevice,
the parties,</i>

1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:26.440
<i>how she'd got Luke involved
knowing what would happen to him,</i>

1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:28.400
<i>and I-I couldn't take it all in.</i>

1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:32.280
<i>I-I asked her where was Luke now,
I want to see him...</i>

1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:37.040
<i>...and that's when she told me
he was dead,</i>

1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:39.400
<i>that Julian Varnham
had killed him...</i>

1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:44.960
<i>...that the Bursary he'd given me
was leverage for Luke.</i>

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:47.840
<i>And that she'd written
all those letters. It all was a lie.</i>

1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:49.760
<i>Friends are supposed to protect
each other!</i>

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:52.320
<i>So are sisters!
And where the hell were you?</i>

1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:53.800
<i>You're just as guilty as I am.</i>

1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:55.000
<i>No!</i>

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:58.920
<i>'Which is when I lost it.
Because I knew it was true.</i>

1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:02.640
<i>'There was so much blood.</i>

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:08.840
<i>'I know I should've helped her,
but I-I panicked.'</i>

1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:14.160
<i>You should've come to me.</i>

1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:18.360
<i>But if I'd told you...</i>

1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:21.680
<i>...it would've been over.</i>

1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:25.680
<i>And I didn't want it to be over.</i>

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:28.440
<i>For Christ's sake!
What about Craydale?</i>

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:30.800
<i>You knew Luke was dead already!</i>

1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:33.840
<i>That was a wild goose chase.
You just lied and lied, and lied!</i>

1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:36.680
<i>It was an accident!
I didn't know what to do!</i>

1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:39.000
<i>You could've told the truth!</i>

1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:43.280
<i>You know, I thought...</i>

1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:50.000
<i>I thought, here is someone who...</i>

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.760
<i>who I could let in to my life...</i>

1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:44.280
<i>Ridley? Ridley. Hold on.</i>

1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:48.160
<i>Glad I caught you.</i>

1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:51.840
<i>Just wanted you to know that
there will be a full investigation</i>

1:25:51.840 --> 1:25:55.560
<i>into every aspect of this case,

<i>That file was signed out by a DCI.</i>
