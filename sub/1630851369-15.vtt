00:07.050 --> 00:09.357
Not the way I see it.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.489
She's been you therapist
for years, what happened?

00:11.533 --> 00:14.492
I thought what I missed
was the work.

00:14.536 --> 00:18.235
Maybe what
I really miss is you.

00:18.279 --> 00:21.499
Exposing the abuse
of the Vas-COM was brave.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.762
<i>The Vas-COM business,</i> <i>
playing nice with the enemy,</i>

00:23.806 --> 00:26.243
it sucked, but I needed
to protect patients.

00:26.287 --> 00:29.246
Turns out whistleblowers
are entitled to a reward.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.552
How about that?

00:33.772 --> 00:36.688
Wait, so Vasik settled
with the Feds?

00:36.732 --> 00:38.342
Well, there's still
some state and criminal cases

00:38.386 --> 00:40.866
going forward,
but from our position--

00:40.910 --> 00:43.043
It's over, Will.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.348
But as whistleblowers,

00:44.392 --> 00:46.307
you and Ms. Goodwin
are entitled

00:46.350 --> 00:49.614
to a percentage
of the settlement.

00:49.658 --> 00:52.095
What are we--
what are we talking about?

00:52.139 --> 00:56.882
You've each been awarded
$1.2 million.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.275
1.2?

01:00.930 --> 01:02.149
Oh...

01:05.152 --> 01:06.153
What does that even mean?

01:06.196 --> 01:07.632
I know it's a lot to take in,

01:07.676 --> 01:09.808
but news like this
is a great opportunity

01:09.852 --> 01:13.638
for you and the hospital.

01:13.682 --> 01:16.728
Sharon Goodwin's volunteered
to gift her entire settlement

01:16.772 --> 01:19.079
to Gaffney's
charitable foundation.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.342
Insisted, really.

01:21.385 --> 01:24.214
Now, there's no pressure,
but I'm putting together

01:24.258 --> 01:26.129
a little press event
for the end of the day

01:26.173 --> 01:28.131
to officially announce
the donation,

01:28.175 --> 01:33.745
and it'd be even more impactful
if you were a part of it.

01:33.789 --> 01:38.228
As Mrs. Goodwin said,
she didn't do it for the money.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.404
I'm sure the same
is true for you.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.537
I-I didn't even know
there'd be money.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.886

01:47.411 --> 01:50.675
- Right.
- So what do you say?

01:53.374 --> 01:57.334
Can we take that as a "yes"?

01:57.378 --> 01:58.683

I want to hear about you.
What's going on with Lonnie?

08:46.351 --> 08:49.267
Well, as you know,
the State Psychiatry Board

08:49.311 --> 08:52.444
frowns on therapists having
any kind of romantic relations

08:52.488 --> 08:54.098
with their patients,
and vice versa,

08:54.142 --> 08:56.144
for at least a year
after their last session,

08:56.187 --> 08:58.407
and it's only been ten months,
so, not a whole lot.

08:59.582 --> 09:03.107
That's soon enough.
What happens now?

09:03.151 --> 09:05.109
It's actually kinda weird,
right?

09:05.153 --> 09:06.676
It's awkward, I--
last time I saw her,

09:06.720 --> 09:08.025
I put something out there,

09:08.069 --> 09:10.506
and I haven't heard
anything back.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.986
It'd been like a week.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.814
Well, keep me in the loop
'cause you know

09:13.857 --> 09:15.990
I live vicariously through you.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.557
- You know I will.
- Okay.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.518
So patient in six,
you're thinking

09:22.562 --> 09:24.041
delusional parasitosis?

09:24.085 --> 09:26.174
I found no evidence
of parasites.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.784
Tox screen and sed rate
were negative.

09:27.828 --> 09:30.265
All of her injuries appear
to be self-inflicted.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.920
The lab did an analysis of the
mite larvae she brought in.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.009
It was a dried pea.
- Hmm.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.924
So CT, MRI,

09:36.967 --> 09:40.362
no signs of striatal lesions
or--or tumors.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.016
Any history of mental illness?

09:42.059 --> 09:43.539
No, not in
her medical records,

09:43.583 --> 09:46.716
but she's certainly presenting
as delusional now.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.718
Look, I know it's not
my area of expertise,

09:48.762 --> 09:50.633
but I'm just not sure
what else it could be.

09:50.677 --> 09:51.895
Could very well be right,

09:51.939 --> 09:55.246
but if she is
in fact delusional,

09:55.290 --> 09:57.031
probably gonna be hostile
to the idea of even

09:57.074 --> 09:59.773
seeing a psychiatrist, so.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.905
We've gotta tread carefully,

10:01.949 --> 10:03.298
and might even need
to improvise.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.085
They're impossible
to get rid of.

10:08.129 --> 10:09.696
I've had to reupholster my car.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.480
Twice.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.395
I don't even bother
doing laundry anymore.

10:13.438 --> 10:16.050
I just wear things once,
then throw them away.

10:16.093 --> 10:17.617
Except for my suit, of course.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.010
It sounds
completely exhausting.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.360
There's not even
a word for it.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.101
And you haven't
been able to find

10:24.145 --> 10:27.061
any medication that'll give you
any relief at all?

10:27.104 --> 10:29.454
My dermatologists
have tried them all.

10:29.498 --> 10:32.762
Antihistamines,
corticosteroids.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.417
Was your lab able to identify
what kind of mite it is?

10:35.460 --> 10:37.811
You know, I think we're still
working on that.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.683
But you know, in the meantime,
I'd like to add another

10:40.727 --> 10:42.946
more targeted drug to help you
with those bites.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.166
Would that be all right?
- Okay.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.646
Okay, great.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.822
Well, I will go find
a nurse to hang a dose,

10:48.865 --> 10:51.520
and I'll be right back.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.699
Your supervisor
seems like a nice man.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.136
Dr. Charles, yeah, he is.

10:59.180 --> 11:02.139
So Abby, it says here
that you first noticed

11:02.183 --> 11:04.402
the infestation a little over
18 months ago.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.013
Yeah.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.623
Can you remember what else
was going on

11:07.667 --> 11:09.277
in your life at the time?

11:09.320 --> 11:11.279
Like, uh--
like, what do you mean?

11:11.322 --> 11:14.021
Like, were you
having problems

11:14.064 --> 11:17.067
in your relationships
or your career?

11:17.111 --> 11:21.202
Had you recently moved
or relocated?

11:21.245 --> 11:23.378
Are you suggesting that
this is all in my head?

11:23.421 --> 11:24.684
No--

11:24.727 --> 11:26.468
You don't think I know
how to read the signs?

11:26.511 --> 11:27.774
I've gone through
enough doctors to know

11:27.817 --> 11:30.124
when they think I'm crazy--
I am not crazy!

11:32.517 --> 11:34.302
How do I get myself discharged?

11:34.345 --> 11:35.477
I want to go
to another hospital.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.305
What's going on?
Is there a problem?

11:37.348 --> 11:38.959
Yes, your underling
here is trying to convince me

11:39.002 --> 11:39.960
that I'm crazy.

11:40.003 --> 11:42.745
Really, Dr. Taylor?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.051
Could you wait
for me outside please?

11:44.094 --> 11:50.318
<i>♪</i>

11:50.361 --> 11:53.974
Look, I'm not delusional.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.192
I'm so sorry about that.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.325
Look, I'm going
to be supervising

11:57.368 --> 11:58.413
your case going forward.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.807
Will that be all right?

12:00.850 --> 12:03.331
Good, now, let's see if
we can do something

12:03.374 --> 12:06.073
about that fever,
what do you say?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.727
Okay.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.036
Thank you very much,
Dr. Taylor,

12:13.080 --> 12:14.255
for playing along in there.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.735
I have to say,
you were quite convincing.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.040
Thank you.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.346
It's strange, though,
Abby wasn't always

12:18.389 --> 12:19.913
so opposed to seeing
a psychiatrist.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.218
What do you mean?

12:21.262 --> 12:22.524
Well, I was digging
deeper into her file,

12:22.567 --> 12:24.352
and it says here
she used to see one regularly

12:24.395 --> 12:26.223
for years, you know,
till the pandemic started.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.530
Huh. Do we have their info?

12:28.573 --> 12:31.925
It's a Dr. Lavine
from The Fischer Group?

12:31.968 --> 12:33.796
- The Fischer Group?
- You know them?

12:33.840 --> 12:36.451
Yeah, I am familiar
with that practice.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.366
It says
Dr. Lavine has retired,

12:38.409 --> 12:40.803
so maybe I can call
someone else from the group

12:40.847 --> 12:42.718
to see if they can
discuss Abby's history?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.372
You know what,
I actually have a colleague

12:44.415 --> 12:46.026
over there, so why don't you
let me do that?

12:46.069 --> 12:49.769
But--excellent work.
Really good work.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.165
- Hey, Dean?
- Mm-hmm?

12:55.209 --> 12:58.125
- You got a second?
- Yeah, sure.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.779
I hear that's all it
took to sucker you

12:59.822 --> 13:01.389
out of a million bucks.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.825
I guess word travels fast.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.827
Yeah, I gotta ask,
did they at least promise you

13:04.871 --> 13:06.437
your own parking spot?

13:06.481 --> 13:08.570
I didn't blow the whistle
for money,

13:08.613 --> 13:10.398
so donating
was the right thing to do.

13:10.441 --> 13:13.270
All right, if you say so.
So what do you need?

13:13.314 --> 13:14.445
Your patient,
Gretchen Cameron,

13:14.489 --> 13:15.969
I saw you
scheduled her for surgery.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.231
Laparotomy is the plan.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.972
Yeah, I took a look
at her chart.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.843
White count's 15
and trending down.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.366
Antibiotics are working.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.760
So it feels like we should
put a pause on the surgery,

13:24.804 --> 13:27.502
try a nasogastric decompression
instead to reduce the dilation.

13:27.545 --> 13:30.070
You reviewed
my patient's chart?

13:30.113 --> 13:31.419
She was upset.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.724
And with her wedding
next weekend,

13:32.768 --> 13:34.248
I thought we could find
her an alternative.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.772
Generous with
your money and time.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.687
An NG decompression
with antibiotics

13:38.730 --> 13:40.863
can bridge her
to a less invasive procedure.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.604
We could safely delay it
until after her wedding,

13:42.647 --> 13:44.998
and Gretchen wouldn't
need the ostomy bag.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.391
None of that is guaranteed
to correct any of her problems,

13:47.435 --> 13:48.871
and any more delay

13:48.915 --> 13:50.742
will increase her chances
of getting septic.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.396
Dean, I think you're
rushing the surgery--

13:52.440 --> 13:54.790
I don't need an E.D. doctor
second guessing my decisions.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.444
Surgeons and
your need to cut--

13:56.487 --> 13:58.576
Excuse me, excuse me.
What is going on here?

13:58.620 --> 13:59.882
We're finishing up here--

13:59.926 --> 14:01.405
Actually we're not
quite finished discussing

14:01.449 --> 14:03.190
how to spare a patient
an aggressive surgery.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.626
My patient.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.410
And I'm just making sure
she doesn't feel

14:06.454 --> 14:07.759
pressured into making
a decision

14:07.803 --> 14:08.978
she's uncomfortable with.

this is
Dr. Archer's department,

14:13.113 --> 14:16.333

his patient.

to make the right call,

16:19.282 --> 16:20.849
a liver transplant
fifteen years ago.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.025

Back when
I thought these were cool.

transplant would reverse

16:28.683 --> 16:30.728
his early onset
atherosclerosis,

16:30.772 --> 16:32.556

previous transplant,

with proximal, right?

18:16.182 --> 18:17.966
Oh, nice to meet you.

Hello, doctor.

18:19.489 --> 18:23.798
So I'm gonna bring
Dr. Richardson up to speed,

18:23.841 --> 18:27.976
and maybe you could just give
us a shout when Abby wakes up?

18:28.019 --> 18:33.068
- Yeah.
- Great--great, okay.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.983
Right this way, please.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.597
I distinctly remember you
being told to stay clear

18:40.641 --> 18:43.078
of this case, and yet,
you told my patient to ask

18:43.122 --> 18:45.080
for a
nasogastric decompression.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.299
She wanted
to know her options.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.822
So what, you just
sign your big check

18:47.865 --> 18:49.171
over to the hospital, and that
gives you carte blanche

18:49.215 --> 18:51.173
to do
whatever the hell you want?

18:51.217 --> 18:52.740
If she doesn't want
to have the operation,

18:52.783 --> 18:54.263
you can't force her to have it.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.613
Well, no, but since it seems
you've made Ms. Cameron

18:56.657 --> 18:58.006
your latest misguided crusade,

18:58.049 --> 19:00.269
you can waste your time
with this procedure.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.143
It's pretty clear
what your preferred

19:04.186 --> 19:05.492
course of action should be.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.624
Get Abby to take
an antipsychotic?

19:07.668 --> 19:10.323
You break the delusion,
you cure the symptoms.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.325
The trick is getting her
to take the medication.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.501
If I even say the
word antipsychotic,

19:14.544 --> 19:16.329
she's gonna kick me
out of the room.

19:16.372 --> 19:19.027
Unless you never
say the word.

19:19.070 --> 19:22.509
Lead her to believe it's
what, an anti-parasitic?

19:22.552 --> 19:24.337
Benevolent deception.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.644
Ethically, it's justified
when four conditions are met.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.821
One, Abby, due to her delusion,

19:30.865 --> 19:33.215
cannot make
an informed decision.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.651
I think we
can both agree on that.

19:34.695 --> 19:37.611
Two, that harm would
likely come to her

19:37.654 --> 19:40.222
if the antipsychotic
wasn't prescribed.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.485
You know, she was
this close to becoming septic.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.487
Three, she probably wouldn't
take medication

19:44.531 --> 19:46.054
if presented as such.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.447
Well, I mean,
that's certainly my belief.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.841
And lastly, that committing
her involuntarily

19:50.885 --> 19:55.542
to coerced treatment would lead
to even a worse result.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.674
