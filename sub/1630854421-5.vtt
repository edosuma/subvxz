00:07.215 --> 00:08.174
- Tragic news
in the disappearance

00:08.216 --> 00:09.509
of the minor out of Brooklyn.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.970
The grisly discovery
made by NYPD

00:12.012 --> 00:13.388
after the parents confessed.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.598
- [singing in Hebrew]

00:15.640 --> 00:18.601
Your husband didn't walk in
on your son with Olivia.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.562
- Dad?

00:20.603 --> 00:21.688
[grunts]

00:21.730 --> 00:23.690
- Your son walked in
on your husband.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.567
- Got a gun.

00:25.608 --> 00:29.112
[both grunting]

00:29.154 --> 00:31.406
- You okay?
- I misread everything.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.992
- You got to the truth
due, in part, to your compass,

00:34.034 --> 00:36.286
but also in spite of it.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.455
- I think it should be me
who learns from you.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.707
- Maybe we learn
from each other.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.875
- We got a report

00:41.916 --> 00:43.626
that Kids Campus
is receiving threats.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.128
I need you to go check it out.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.172
- I didn't report any threat.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.298
- I told you about it.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.216
I found this taped
to the window.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.676
- And it wouldn't occur to you
to report this?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.261
- Yeah, what do you
expect me to do?

00:53.303 --> 00:56.556
Shut down every time somebody
tapes a drawing to my window?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.558
- If it's a drawing
of a bomb...

00:58.600 --> 01:00.477
[device beeps]
- There is no bomb.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.563
[suspenseful music]

01:05.648 --> 01:08.610
[tense music]

01:08.651 --> 01:15.575
* *

01:59.703 --> 02:02.664
[tense music]

02:02.706 --> 02:09.629
* *

02:20.724 --> 02:21.683
- [exhales deeply]

02:21.725 --> 02:23.309
You didn't have to come,
you know.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.728
I could've called
the next name on the list.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.146
- When it's my turn
to volunteer,

02:26.187 --> 02:27.397
I show up, always.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.524
- It's nice the police let you
do this.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.656
- Where's the casket?

02:36.698 --> 02:37.991
- Ugh.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.159
Supply chain problems.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.745
We had to borrow one
from Lakewood.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.288
It'll get here.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.041
- Who was he?

02:46.082 --> 02:48.376
- Oh, wait, I'll tell you.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.881
Isaac Zabarsky. Heard of him?

02:52.922 --> 02:54.049
Me neither.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.384
86 years old, no family.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.182
[groans]

03:02.223 --> 03:03.350
Never stand when you can sit,

03:03.391 --> 03:04.934
never sit
when you can lie down.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.652
The night is long.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.112
- This is how you comfort
the soul?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.531
- I'm useless if I'm not awake.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.034
Siddur can drag in the middle.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.744
- Mm.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.621
- Remember how this used to
freak us out when we were kids?

03:24.662 --> 03:27.832
- Mm.
- Remember your first?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.000
First shomer?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.880
[subway clattering]

03:33.922 --> 03:35.340
[loud thud]

03:39.135 --> 03:41.221
- It wasn't exactly shomer.

03:41.262 --> 03:48.436
* *

03:51.439 --> 03:54.859
[alarm wailing]

03:54.901 --> 03:57.904
[indistinct chatter]

03:57.946 --> 04:00.657
- Everybody,
just stay in the safe area.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.243
Keep moving to the safe area.
Thank you very much.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.452
Okay, Earl, what do we know?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.912
- So far, that there's a bomb

04:05.954 --> 04:07.455
and that the FBI are in charge,
which they conveyed

04:07.497 --> 04:08.540
with their customary
"fuck you" attitude.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.708
- "FBI are in charge"

04:09.749 --> 04:11.251
are the scariest words
in the world.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.628
Okay, let's make sure
they don't do anything stupid.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.338
Janine, keep everybody calm
and moving.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.840
- Yep.
- Want me to pick you up?

04:16.881 --> 04:18.091
- Oh, careful.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.427
You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's not real.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.761
- What? Sorry?
- The thing.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.722
It's not real.
- How do you know?

04:23.763 --> 04:25.348
- Okay. All right, come on.
- 'Scuse me.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.808
[camera clicking]

04:26.850 --> 04:28.226
- All right, come on. Let's go.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.312
[indistinct radio chatter]

04:33.189 --> 04:34.315
- Make a hole. Make a hole.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.610
- Is this the same day care
as the previous threat?

04:37.652 --> 04:38.737
- One and the same.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.697
That she didn't take seriously.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.956
[tense ethereal music]

04:49.998 --> 04:56.963
* *

05:28.203 --> 05:30.246
- Sir?

05:30.288 --> 05:31.498
Sir!

05:31.539 --> 05:34.501
[dramatic music]

05:34.542 --> 05:41.091
* *

05:46.554 --> 05:48.973
- Ah!
[groans]

05:51.351 --> 05:52.686
- Okay.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.021
So how do you wanna play this?

05:59.609 --> 06:00.568
[indistinct chatter]

06:00.610 --> 06:02.696
- One sec.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.780
So it was a fake?

06:03.822 --> 06:05.365
- Sniffer dog said so.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.368
But they blew it up anyway,
just to be safe.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.203
Personally, I think they just
like blowing shit up.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.287
Breaks up the day.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.249
- You know,
one guy seemed to know.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.583
- I beg your pardon?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.252
- One of the dads told me
it was a fake,

06:17.293 --> 06:19.587
which seemed
a little suspicious,

06:19.629 --> 06:22.590
so I snapped a picture of him.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.551
- Don't ever do this again.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.177
- What?
- Photograph civilians.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.971
They hate it. They'll complain
that you violated their rights.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.764
It'll screw up
your personnel file

06:29.806 --> 06:31.433
and cause no end of troubles
for the squad.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.518
- Well, technically, Earl,
it's not against procedure.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.770
The law allows us
to photograph people in public.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.188
- Jesus, you sound
like Avi already.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.149
Just don't do it.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.614
All right, who is this guy?

06:46.656 --> 06:47.782
- He bumped into me.
- Uh-huh.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.492
- He told me it wasn't real,

06:49.534 --> 06:50.785
which I found odd.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.579
- Well, grab Avi
and talk to him.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.039
Since it's just
a bomb scare now,

06:54.080 --> 06:56.166
the FBI pulled out
and we have jurisdiction again.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.293
- I don't go for this "just
a bomb scare" bullshit, Earl.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.462
When kids are involved,
it's not just a bomb scare.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.963
It's a five-alarm fire.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.174
Whoever did this,
I want them caught right now.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.300
- Yes, ma'am.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.427
- Janine.
- Yes.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.846
- Don't ever pursue a suspect
by yourself.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.639
- It just happened.
He suddenly took off,

07:11.681 --> 07:12.766
and then so did I.
- It was stupid.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.309
It was dangerous.
You ever do anything

07:14.351 --> 07:17.395
like that again, and I will
personally kick your ass.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.982
- Got it.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.485
- So you gonna question him
or not?

07:23.526 --> 07:24.569
- The suspect?

07:24.611 --> 07:25.987
I-I get to question him?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.280
- You caught him,
you clean him.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.865
Where's Avi?

07:32.660 --> 07:33.703
- Oh, my God.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.829
Heplanted it?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.831
- Do you know this man?
- Yeah.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.167
I mean, I--I--I did know him.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.127
Uh, he's a former parent.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.004
His daughter was here
last year,

07:43.046 --> 07:44.255
but they pulled her out.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.924
- Did you have any issues
with him?

07:45.965 --> 07:48.593
- Him? No.
I--

07:48.635 --> 07:51.388
in fact,
he couldn't have been nicer.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.265
But, um, his wife,
on the other hand,

07:54.307 --> 07:55.850
had opinions.

07:55.892 --> 07:56.935
- What about?
- [sighs]

07:56.976 --> 07:58.561
Uh, everything.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.189
I'm sure she's a lovely woman.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.774
She just couldn't help herself.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.026
She second-guessed
almost everything we did.

08:05.068 --> 08:09.072
But the Holts are
well-intentioned, good people,

08:09.114 --> 08:11.116
not the type
that would plant a bomb.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.992
- I'm not sure there's a type.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.829
Or there are too many types.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.330
The mentally ill.

08:17.372 --> 08:20.041
A person
trying to make a statement.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.584
The extortionist.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.795
The fact it was fake
certainly suggests

08:23.837 --> 08:26.172
someone wishing
to make a statement

08:26.214 --> 08:27.966
and strike fear.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.217
Can you think of any reason

08:29.259 --> 08:32.387
why this man would run
from the scene?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.139
- No.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.225
- This is crazy.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.102
The only reason I was there
is because I stopped

08:39.144 --> 08:40.729
to see what was going on.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.188
I know the school.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.065
Our daughter used to go there.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.693
I was curious.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.361
- Why did you run?

08:48.403 --> 08:50.488
- I actually didn't run
at first.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.741
I started to walk,

08:52.782 --> 08:55.285
and then you chased me, so...

09:00.123 --> 09:02.459
- That doesn't sound like
a great answer to me.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.379
Does it sound like one to you?

09:09.132 --> 09:11.968
- Okay, yes,
it was stupid to run.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.471
- But you did.
- But I didn't plant a bomb.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.225
- Mr. Holt,

09:19.267 --> 09:22.187
I looked out
at a whole sea of bystanders,

09:22.228 --> 09:26.775
and only one of them, you,

09:26.816 --> 09:29.361
chose to make yourself
distinctive.

09:29.402 --> 09:33.198
That kind of behavior isn't
consistent with innocence.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.993
So I suggest you either give me
the reason that you ran,

09:37.035 --> 09:39.788
or I'll have no choice
but to conclude

09:39.829 --> 09:42.749
that it's over this bomb.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.752
[tense music]

09:45.794 --> 09:47.921
- I want a lawyer.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.841
- Damn it.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.804
[sighs]

09:55.845 --> 09:56.888
I boxed him.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.306
He was starting to talk,

09:58.348 --> 10:00.141
at least some,
and I should have just let him,

10:00.183 --> 10:02.477
but instead I--I--I--
I cornered him.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.479
- Well, he has
no criminal record, right?

10:04.521 --> 10:07.399
- Yeah, none, but he's
clearly hiding something,

10:07.440 --> 10:09.150
so I don't get it.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.568
- He maybe he had drugs on him.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.821
Maybe he saw you,
got nervous, and took off,

10:12.862 --> 10:14.572
tossed the drugs
during the chase.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.908
Everybody's guilty of something
we got no idea about.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.327
- The owner of the day care,
she's hiding something too.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.914
How 'bout you two go talk
to her again,

10:22.956 --> 10:23.998
and I'll have a go
with our runner.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.250
We can compare notes.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.710
- Uh, we still got
unsolved murders.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.294
We're gonna put three
detectives on a bomb scare?

10:28.336 --> 10:30.672
- Davies says it's a top
priority, and I agree with her.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.383
It may be nothing, but what
side do we want to err on?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.388
- There's been another threat.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.313
- It was definitely
a woman's voice, I'm positive.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.274
- And her exact words?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.443
- "The bomb was
just the beginning."

10:51.484 --> 10:53.445
That's all she said,
and then she hung up.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.988
- You didn't recognize
the voice at all?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.906
- I don't think so, no.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.491
- I feel so terrible.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.493
I told you that there was
nothing to worry about,

11:00.535 --> 11:03.038
but had that bomb been real,

11:03.079 --> 11:05.498
I mean, my God,
people could have been killed.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.500
- And this Holt,
the man we detained?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.627
- No. I can't imagine.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.463
I told your colleague earlier

11:11.504 --> 11:15.342
that he and his wife
are good people.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.509
They just didn't like
my day care,

11:16.551 --> 11:19.596
so they went somewhere else.

11:19.637 --> 11:23.308
But to plant a bomb,
fake or otherwise...

11:23.350 --> 11:24.893
no.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.064
- What about this man?

11:29.105 --> 11:30.398
- Paul Serra.
- Mm-hmm.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.442
- Uh, his son goes here.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.278
- Any issues with him?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.614
- Actually...

11:40.325 --> 11:42.786
Okay.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.121
You're gonna think that I fight
with all the parents here,

11:45.163 --> 11:46.456
which I do not.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.957
- You butted heads with him?

11:47.999 --> 11:50.543
- About a week ago,
but he didn't threaten me.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.462
- What was the issue?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.882
- His son got a bump
on his head,

11:55.924 --> 11:58.510
and his wife thought that one
of the other kids here did it,

11:58.551 --> 12:01.012
but I told them
I don't allow hitting here.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.931
Then I also said,

12:02.972 --> 12:05.475
"Kids hurt themselves
all the time,

12:05.517 --> 12:08.812
here, with a friend,
or at home,"

12:08.853 --> 12:11.815
which was probably
a mistake on my part.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.609
- And how did he react to that?
- Not well.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.277
Not that I blamed him.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.779
Okay? But we got past it.

12:17.821 --> 12:21.574
And he is actually
a very sweet man.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.868
I'm just--I'm sorry.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.997
It's--it's, uh--
it has been a day.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.040
[sighs]

12:31.001 --> 12:33.169
- I told the other detective,
I want a lawyer.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.879
- We'll accommodate that.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.132
But first, I'd like to share
some information with you.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.843
There's just been another
threat to the day care.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.678
This time, it was a phone call.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.680
- Well, it wasn't me.
I've been here the whole time.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.973
- I know,
which is why I don't think

12:45.015 --> 12:47.183
you planted the device,
Mr. Holt.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.352
[tense music]

12:49.394 --> 12:50.311
- Thank you.
- Of course.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.938
You can relax on that.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.315
A man with no criminal record
or history of violence,

12:54.357 --> 12:57.402
it makes no sense to me
that you would do this.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.864
But nor does running
for no reason.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.490
- I explained it
to your partner.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.867
- Could you explain it to me?

13:03.908 --> 13:06.578
Not the bomb part.
That I'm not concerned with.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.330
But the running part.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.583
* *

13:11.624 --> 13:13.585
- [sighs]

13:14.711 --> 13:19.049
- Look, when an explosive
device is placed

13:19.090 --> 13:20.592
at a day care center,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.635
there's a great deal
of pressure

13:22.677 --> 13:25.305
put upon the police department
to unearth a suspect.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.558
From the media, the public,
the mandate is the same:

13:28.600 --> 13:31.186
find the bad guy--
which we will do.

13:31.227 --> 13:35.899
Or in lieu of, we'll supply
a strong person of interest.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.443
Life would certainly
get complicated

13:38.485 --> 13:39.527
for any such person.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.363
His face would be on the news,

13:41.404 --> 13:42.739
on social media--

13:42.781 --> 13:44.449
- You're threatening me?
- No, I'm just telling you

13:44.491 --> 13:46.701
how things work.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.329
You ran from the scene,
Mr. Holt.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.247
That makes you suspicious.

13:51.289 --> 13:54.292
If there is a simple
explanation as to why you fled,

13:54.334 --> 13:57.962
it would be in your best
interest to provide it.

13:58.004 --> 14:04.928
* *

14:07.389 --> 14:11.017
You have a daughter
the same age

14:11.059 --> 14:15.021
as the children
who attend this day care.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.648
Right?

14:19.651 --> 14:22.070
What's your daughter's name?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.824
- Gabrielle.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.993
- The children at this center
could be in danger.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.746
Help us eliminate you
as a suspect

14:31.788 --> 14:37.210
so we can better focus
on whoever did this.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.004
Tell me why you ran.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.717
- You're right.
I didn't put the bomb there.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.844
And I damn sure didn't
make another threat.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.178
You're also right,

14:47.220 --> 14:49.305
I shouldn't have run.

14:49.347 --> 14:53.018
Beyond that,
I don't know what to tell you.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.523
- So we're kicking him?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.233
- We have no evidence.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.360
The DA won't charge him
just because he ran.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.611
And even if they did,

15:03.653 --> 15:04.821
judges nowadays
wouldn't hold him,

15:04.863 --> 15:06.281
so we have no choice.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.907
- Why would he run
if he didn't do anything?

15:07.949 --> 15:10.035
- That's an excellent
question.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.620
But we can't hold him
on an unspecified charge.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.788
- Yeah.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.208
This one.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.668
- What about Ms. Harvey?

15:18.710 --> 15:20.545
- Didn't get much from her.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.049
[doorbell rings]

15:27.927 --> 15:30.138
Mr. Serra, Detective Harris.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.349
We bumped into each other
this morning by the school.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.725
- Oh, yeah. I remember.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.352
- And this is
Detective Avraham.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.187
- Hello.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.772
- Hello.

15:38.813 --> 15:39.939
- Can we come in?

15:41.941 --> 15:45.320
- Look, I-I didn't know
that the bomb was fake.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.947
I was just saying that because
the kids were freaking out,

15:47.989 --> 15:49.240
all right?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.370
[sighs]

15:53.411 --> 15:56.456
I ca--that's why I called
the bomb a "thing."

15:56.498 --> 16:01.461
- Ms. Harvey said that you
and she had words recently.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.129
- Meaning what?
- It's nothing.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.632
We're just
collecting information,

16:05.674 --> 16:07.300
seeing if anyone
at the day care

16:07.342 --> 16:08.635
had any kind of bias.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.096
- I-I don't have a bias.
- I'm sure you don't.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.057
Can you tell us what
the confrontation was about?

16:14.099 --> 16:17.143
- [sighs]
Yeah, Eric had some bruises,

16:17.185 --> 16:19.646
and we suspected that something
might be going on at school.

16:19.688 --> 16:24.567
So I asked Ms. Harvey about it,
and she got aggressive with me.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.320
- Did you get aggressive
with her?

16:27.362 --> 16:31.032
- I mean, we certainly argued
about it, yeah.

16:31.074 --> 16:34.160
The day before, my wife had
raised some questions about it,

16:34.202 --> 16:35.829
and Ms. Harvey got
hostile with her,

16:35.870 --> 16:37.497
then she got hostile with me.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.250
You know, you expect
someone who runs a day care

16:40.291 --> 16:44.087
would have a more
calming disposition.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.297
You know?
And I-I'm an electrician.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.008
I'm no psychologist,
but there's something--

16:48.049 --> 16:49.718
something off about that lady.

16:49.759 --> 16:50.885
- Off how?

16:50.927 --> 16:54.431
- She's just tightly wound,
you know?

16:54.472 --> 16:56.641
Like she's gonna snap.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.893
You know?

16:58.935 --> 17:01.062
- Does your wife,
Elisabeth, think so too?

17:01.104 --> 17:02.731
- Yeah.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.358
- May we speak with your wife?

17:05.400 --> 17:09.946
- No, she's, uh--she's in
Mexico visiting her family.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.281
It's the first time
she's been able to do that

17:11.322 --> 17:13.616
since the pandemic.
Hey, buddy.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.452
- Are you the police?

17:15.493 --> 17:17.662
- This is my-my son, Danny.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.415
This is Detective Harris
and--I'm sorry.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.334
- Avraham.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.378
- I know who left the bomb.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.881
- Danny, honey.
- You saw who did it?

17:27.922 --> 17:32.218
- I didn't see,
but I know who it was.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.221
- Okay.
- My first dad told me.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.432
- He-he doesn't have
a first dad.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.808
- Yes, I do.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.311
And he told me.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.772
- He told you
who left the bomb?

17:43.813 --> 17:45.732
- But it's a secret.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.026
He made me promise.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.415
[pins clattering]

18:02.457 --> 18:05.210
- Somebody's been sending
bomb threats to the day care.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.087
Your husband, Brad,
is a suspect.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.421
- My Brad?
- Mm-hmm.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.048
- A bomb?
[laughs]

18:10.090 --> 18:11.675
Brad's not exactly
Mr. Excitement.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.177
I mean, there's a reason
I joined a bowling league.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.303
- Right.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.724
- I'm sorry, that's not fair.
He's a good guy.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.893
A good husband, good father,

18:21.935 --> 18:23.103
and he's hot, don't forget.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.729
[chuckles]
He looks tough with the tats,

18:24.771 --> 18:26.231
but trust me, he's not.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.149
- Why would he run
from the scene?

18:28.191 --> 18:30.235
- He's not into confrontation.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.112
Anything that involves
a disagreement or yelling,

18:32.153 --> 18:33.238
he runs.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.240
Trust me.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.618
- You and your husband, you had
an issue with Anna Harvey?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.412
- I mainly did.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.955
I didn't like her.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.749
Neither did Brad, but...

18:44.791 --> 18:46.668
he wouldn't stand up to her.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.170
- And why'd you dislike her?

18:49.212 --> 18:51.464
- You know what, I shouldn't
say I didn't like her.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.217
I hate her.

18:54.259 --> 18:55.176
- Wow.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.594
- Some teachers run day cares

18:56.636 --> 18:58.263
because they love kids.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.806
There are others who do it
'cause they get off

18:59.848 --> 19:03.852
having dominion, both over
the children and their parents.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.646
Anna Harvey is that type.

19:06.688 --> 19:10.233
She's a bully and a fraud and--

19:10.275 --> 19:11.943
[clears throat]
Never mind.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.570
- Nah, go ahead.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.240
- Let's just say, if she was
struggling with her business,

19:17.282 --> 19:18.450
you might want to check to see

19:18.491 --> 19:20.118
if her insurance covers
bomb scares.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.954
- Wow. You really do hate her.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.330
- All the parents do.

19:24.372 --> 19:28.043
The difference with me,
I decided to do something.

19:28.084 --> 19:31.421
- Which was what?

19:31.463 --> 19:33.381
- To take my daughter
out of the center.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.010
- Thank you.
- Sure.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.097
- We've been seeing
a family therapist about it.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.974
The doctor says
there's nothing to worry about,

19:43.016 --> 19:46.770
that children create
imaginary friends.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.646
- Yeah. My niece has one.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.190
- Yeah, a friend.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.233
You ever heard of a kid
making up an imaginary parent?

19:52.275 --> 19:53.902
- He doesn't have
a stepdad or--

19:53.943 --> 19:55.362
- He's just got me.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.823
- What about your wife?
Has she been married before?

19:58.865 --> 20:01.701
- No. Look, there's--
there's nothing to figure out.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.203
He makes stuff up.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.207
It's upsetting, I admit,

20:07.248 --> 20:09.626
that he would have to invent
a second father.

20:09.668 --> 20:13.213
- Does he do so more
in times of stress?

20:13.254 --> 20:15.507
- Yeah.
- Could I talk to your son?

20:15.548 --> 20:18.385
It-it's possible he knows
something about the bomb.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.761
- He doesn't.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.388
[soft dramatic music]

20:21.429 --> 20:23.515
- We all have
an unconscious self,

20:23.556 --> 20:25.809
one that can be knowing.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.353
We suddenly find ourselves
in possession of information,

20:28.395 --> 20:30.563
and we have no idea
as to how it came to us.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.694
I had a vision myself,
just last night,

20:35.735 --> 20:39.531
a flashback or hallucination,

20:39.572 --> 20:41.991
which perhaps revealed
a knowledge I've always had.

20:42.033 --> 20:46.287
* *

20:46.329 --> 20:49.416
The brain is
a very mysterious thing.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.963
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.048
- I'm suggesting
your son may know something.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.551
He may be delusional
as the source,

20:59.592 --> 21:01.678
but the information
itself could be valid.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.056
- My son doesn't know anything
about the bomb

21:05.098 --> 21:07.142
or-or the fake bomb,
I can promise you that.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.560
- On the chance that he might,

21:08.601 --> 21:10.687
I can give you my word,
I will not traumatize him.

21:10.729 --> 21:13.356
In fact, it might help Danny
if you let me talk to him.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.942
I can assure him
everything is gonna be okay.

21:15.984 --> 21:19.237
The world is such
a scary place right now.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.864
We haven't shared this
with the public yet,

21:20.905 --> 21:23.283
but the day care received
another threat about a bomb.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.369
The kids at Eric's school
could be in danger.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.538
However remote the chance
that Danny witnessed

21:28.580 --> 21:30.582
or intuited anything relevant--
- Okay, okay, okay.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.834
I would have to talk
to his therapist first

21:32.876 --> 21:34.961
to make sure it's okay,
and I would have to be present.

21:35.003 --> 21:38.590
- Of course,
talk to his therapist.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.550
But I would do better
one-on-one.

21:40.592 --> 21:41.718
- No, I can't allow that.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.553
He's seven years old.
He'd be terrified.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.097
- What if there were a way
for you to supervise

21:46.139 --> 21:48.099
and for Detective Avraham
to be alone with him?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.392
Would that work?

21:49.434 --> 21:51.436
- We're not here
to upset your son.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.229
We're here
to protect your other son

21:53.271 --> 21:55.940
and all the kids
who go to that day care.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.610
Please, you seem like
a good father.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.446
We're here
to protect your boys.

22:03.782 --> 22:08.203
- So what was this
hallucination that you had?

22:08.244 --> 22:10.705
Did you just make it up?

22:10.747 --> 22:13.291
- No. It happened.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.418
I was standing shomer,

22:15.460 --> 22:17.837
and I suddenly saw images
of my father.

22:17.879 --> 22:18.963
He died when I was five.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.674
- Wh--standing what?

22:20.715 --> 22:22.133
- Shomer.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.010
It's a Jewish tradition.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.971
We volunteer to do it
for those who have no one else.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.348
When a person passes--

22:28.390 --> 22:32.686
in this case,
he was an old man--

22:32.727 --> 22:36.690
we stand shomer
till he can be buried.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.650
- And why do you do it?

22:38.692 --> 22:40.193
- To comfort the soul.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.695
And to guard the body

22:41.736 --> 22:43.738
so it doesn't get eaten
by animals.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.159
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.786
- This is what you do
with your free time?

22:49.828 --> 22:51.663
[chuckles]

22:51.705 --> 22:53.123
You guard dead bodies

22:53.164 --> 22:55.583
so that they don't get
eaten by animals?

22:55.625 --> 22:57.168
- Mm-hmm.
- Have you thought about maybe

22:57.210 --> 22:59.087
subscribing to Netflix or--

22:59.129 --> 23:01.214
- Careful,
or I won't take you to shul.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.674
- Oh, come on.

23:07.387 --> 23:10.223
Your father, you, um,

23:10.265 --> 23:12.058
witnessed his death?

23:13.852 --> 23:15.729
- I didn't see it. I heard it.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.188
- You heard it?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.733
[tense music]

23:19.774 --> 23:21.276
- We lived
in an apartment building

23:21.317 --> 23:23.028
six flights up.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.405
I was outside walking our dog.

23:25.447 --> 23:29.367
And I heard the sound
my father made

23:29.409 --> 23:30.994
when he landed on the ground.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.579
- Oh, my God.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.418
- He was lying
in a pool of blood.

23:39.711 --> 23:42.714
One second he was
in the kitchen smiling.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.259
The next...

23:46.301 --> 23:53.141
* *

23:54.059 --> 23:56.269
- I'm so sorry.

23:56.311 --> 23:58.605
- The police did
an investigation.

23:58.646 --> 24:02.734
They concluded
that my father didn't fall.

24:02.776 --> 24:03.818
He was pushed.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.404
- Excuse me?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.782
- The nature of his injuries,

24:08.823 --> 24:10.825
the rate of descent...

24:13.078 --> 24:14.913
But not the who

24:14.954 --> 24:17.916
or the why.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.085
Nothing.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.336
- [gasps softly]

24:21.378 --> 24:23.838
Avi, since you've been a cop,

24:23.880 --> 24:26.424
have you ever looked
into your father's case?

24:30.095 --> 24:31.680
- No.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.431
No, I, uh...

24:34.808 --> 24:36.643
No.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.439
- I can't imagine.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.317
Five years old, that's...

24:44.359 --> 24:51.491
* *

24:56.413 --> 24:57.747
[clears throat]

25:07.632 --> 25:08.717
- They eat babies.
I've seen it at the web,

25:08.758 --> 25:09.676
and on the news.
- Thanks again.

25:09.718 --> 25:10.677
- I talked to Holt's wife.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.387
- And?
- She's nuts.

25:12.429 --> 25:15.056
She says he lacks the balls
to do anything this stupid.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.225
What I can tell you is that

25:17.267 --> 25:21.021
everyone seems to have
questions about Anna Harvey.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.357
- Huh.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.652
- Jeez, ah, I'm not
comfortable with this.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.864
- I assure you that he will
take great care with your boy.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.449
Detective Avraham
has assured him

25:32.490 --> 25:34.034
that if, for any reason,
he wants to stop,

25:34.075 --> 25:35.326
any reason whatsoever--

25:35.368 --> 25:37.787
- He's seven years old,
for God's sake.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.332
- And here's a candy.

25:43.626 --> 25:44.961
You don't want the candy?

25:45.003 --> 25:46.254
No?

25:46.296 --> 25:49.132
- My mom doesn't
let me eat sugar.

25:49.174 --> 25:50.675
- She sounds like a good mom.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.303
- You want to know
about the bomb.

25:53.345 --> 25:54.471
- Yes.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.473
What your first dad told you.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.725
- I promised him
I wouldn't tell.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.852
- I respect promises.

26:00.894 --> 26:04.647
I especially respect people
who keep their word.

26:04.689 --> 26:07.108
I can see
you're a noble person.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.526
Not everyone is.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.320
Is your first dad noble?

26:10.362 --> 26:11.821
- Yes.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.990
- I bet he would want
to help too.

26:14.032 --> 26:16.910
Help all the children
at the day care,

26:16.951 --> 26:18.703
and especially Eric.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.872
Is he Eric's first dad as well?

26:20.914 --> 26:22.665
- No. Just mine.

26:22.707 --> 26:24.417
- And your first mother?

26:24.459 --> 26:26.044
- I only have one mother.

26:26.086 --> 26:27.504
- I see.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.673
- I think
she's visiting him now.

26:29.714 --> 26:31.966
- In Mexico?
- No.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.677
My father thinks
she's in Mexico

26:33.718 --> 26:36.721
visiting my grandmother
and grandfather,

26:36.763 --> 26:40.684
but I think she's really
visiting my first dad.

26:40.725 --> 26:43.019
- Where would that be?
- It's a secret.

26:43.061 --> 26:45.355
- Another secret?

26:45.397 --> 26:47.565
Oh, man.
[both laugh]

26:49.526 --> 26:52.195
Can you tell me a little
about your mom

26:52.237 --> 26:53.530
and your first dad?

26:53.571 --> 26:56.199
- Like what?
- I don't know.

26:56.241 --> 26:57.450
Do they love each other?

26:57.492 --> 26:58.618
- Yes.
- Yes?

26:58.660 --> 27:00.745
- They never fight.
- Never fight?

27:00.787 --> 27:03.873
- And they're always nice
to each other.

27:03.915 --> 27:08.545
- And what about your mom
and your father, the dad I met?

27:08.586 --> 27:11.589
Are they sometimes not nice
to each other?

27:14.050 --> 27:15.719
Do they sometimes fight?

27:17.429 --> 27:19.556
Do they fight a lot?

27:21.016 --> 27:22.517
- Sometimes.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.728
- Yeah?

27:24.769 --> 27:28.440
I bet it can be scary
when they fight.

27:30.108 --> 27:31.860
- Sometimes.

27:33.236 --> 27:35.238
- What do they fight about?

27:35.280 --> 27:37.115
- I don't know.

27:37.157 --> 27:40.243
- You don't know?

27:40.285 --> 27:42.412
You must have an idea.

27:42.454 --> 27:45.081
- I block my ears, and I sing.

27:45.123 --> 27:46.541
- What do you sing?

27:46.583 --> 27:48.543
- "This Little Light."

27:48.585 --> 27:49.794
- I know that song.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.047
I used to sing that song
when I was your age,

27:52.088 --> 27:53.006
but not in English,

27:53.048 --> 27:54.341
in Hebrew.

27:54.382 --> 27:57.469
[singing in Hebrew]

28:00.096 --> 28:01.222
- [chuckles]

28:03.600 --> 28:06.603
- It always made me
feel better.

28:06.644 --> 28:07.604
You know what else?

28:07.645 --> 28:09.272
When I was your age

28:09.314 --> 28:11.775
and my parents argued,

28:11.816 --> 28:13.777
I'd block my ears, too,

28:13.818 --> 28:15.612
I guess to feel better.

28:17.322 --> 28:21.159
You think your mom went to see
your first dad to feel better?

28:21.201 --> 28:24.037
To get away from the fight
she had at home?

28:25.288 --> 28:26.873
- Maybe.

28:29.209 --> 28:32.587
- What do you
and your first dad talk about?

28:32.629 --> 28:34.506
- Lots of stuff.

28:35.882 --> 28:39.344
- When he told you who it was
that put it there--

28:39.386 --> 28:40.553
- It's a secret.

28:40.595 --> 28:41.763
- Yes, I know,

28:41.805 --> 28:44.724
but it could really help us

28:44.766 --> 28:46.810
protect the kids
at the day care.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.603
[soft dramatic music]

28:48.645 --> 28:51.064
When your first dad told you

28:51.106 --> 28:55.735
who it was
that put the bomb there,

28:55.777 --> 28:58.321
you know this person.

28:58.363 --> 29:00.490
Right?

29:00.532 --> 29:03.243
I can see that you do.

29:03.284 --> 29:10.208
* *

29:16.047 --> 29:18.508
Did your dad plant the bomb,
your second dad?

29:18.550 --> 29:21.469
[tense music]

29:21.511 --> 29:23.805
* *

29:23.847 --> 29:25.515
- I didn't plant that bomb.

29:25.557 --> 29:26.683
I would never do
something like that,

29:26.725 --> 29:29.728
let alone scare my kids.

29:29.769 --> 29:32.647
- I-I believe you.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.232
Can you think of a reason

29:34.274 --> 29:37.235
why your son would say
that you did do it?

29:38.361 --> 29:41.948
Mr. Serra, if we want to help
your son, we need to be honest.

29:41.990 --> 29:45.535
I don't think a child says
shocking or hurtful things

29:45.577 --> 29:48.163
without a reason.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.497
I wonder, is it possible

29:49.539 --> 29:52.208
Danny is angry at you
for some reason?

29:56.963 --> 29:58.131
- He's--

30:01.593 --> 30:04.971
He's probably very angry
with me, yes.

30:05.013 --> 30:08.558
His mother and I have
been having problems.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.352
And--
[sighs]

30:11.811 --> 30:14.356
The fighting...

30:14.397 --> 30:17.734
has gotten very bad as of late.

30:17.776 --> 30:19.319
- How bad?

30:20.945 --> 30:23.239
Bad enough that she left?

30:23.281 --> 30:24.824
Bad enough that you raised
a hand to her?

30:24.866 --> 30:27.410
- God, no. Never.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.661
It's--

30:30.121 --> 30:33.375
Bad enough that she went to be
with her parents in Mexico.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.253
Last week, we fought,

30:37.295 --> 30:39.005
and it was really bad.

30:40.799 --> 30:42.509
And she said she's done,

30:42.550 --> 30:46.721
so she packed a bag
and she walked out the door.

30:46.763 --> 30:50.266
Not the first time.
She's-she's left before.

30:50.308 --> 30:52.769
She usually comes back
in a day or two.

30:54.062 --> 30:57.107
But it's been over a week.

30:57.148 --> 31:01.653
And I don't--I don't know,
the way...

31:01.695 --> 31:05.990
she left this time, it--

31:09.619 --> 31:12.455
I don't think
she's coming back to us.

31:12.497 --> 31:15.458
[soft dramatic music]

31:15.500 --> 31:21.381
* *

31:21.423 --> 31:24.342
[breathing shakily]

31:32.892 --> 31:35.020
- An incredibly stupid thing
for you to do,

31:35.061 --> 31:37.522
for you to just take off
and run?

31:37.564 --> 31:40.150
- You think I don't know that?

31:40.191 --> 31:42.235
I don't know what else
to say to you.

31:42.277 --> 31:44.320
[tense music]

31:44.362 --> 31:46.990
- Let me just say that
of all the fucked up choices

31:47.032 --> 31:48.491
you've made,
and there have been many...

31:48.533 --> 31:49.701
[silverware clatters loudly]

31:51.995 --> 31:54.205
For you even to go back there,

31:54.247 --> 31:55.790
unbelievable.

32:04.382 --> 32:06.593
- Some of the parents
are asking if we plan

32:06.634 --> 32:08.636
to have extra security.

32:08.678 --> 32:11.056
- Oh, God.
We should, shouldn't we?

32:12.432 --> 32:15.518
I wouldn't even know
who to call about that.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.479
For now, let's just tell them

32:17.520 --> 32:21.649
that we will provide
a safe environment.

32:21.691 --> 32:22.817
- I don't want to lie to them.

32:22.859 --> 32:23.777
- I don't want
to lie to them either,

32:23.818 --> 32:24.944
but I don't know
what else to do.

32:28.239 --> 32:30.533
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to snap at you.

32:30.575 --> 32:32.660
This is just such a nightmare.

32:32.702 --> 32:33.620
[cell phone ringing]

32:33.661 --> 32:35.080
[sighs]

32:36.581 --> 32:38.416
This is Anna Harvey.

32:41.419 --> 32:43.505
No. No, you listen to me.

32:43.546 --> 32:44.923
Okay, this needs to stop.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.883
Do you understand?

32:48.259 --> 32:51.346
You need to stop this
right now.

32:51.388 --> 32:53.807
- It was that woman, wasn't it?
What did she say?

32:53.848 --> 32:58.144
* *

32:58.186 --> 33:00.313
She's not done with us, is she?

33:00.355 --> 33:04.359
* *

33:09.656 --> 33:10.657
- Another threat.

33:10.699 --> 33:11.991
Can you believe it?
That makes four.

33:12.033 --> 33:15.120
- Again, a call.
Again, from a woman.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.454
This is getting me very angry.

33:16.496 --> 33:18.289
If this ends up
in a real bombing,

33:18.331 --> 33:20.500
I am gonna kill somebody.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.043
- No record
of an Elisabeth Serra

33:22.085 --> 33:23.378
taking any flights to Mexico.

33:23.420 --> 33:25.296
- Why the hell are you looking
into a possible

33:25.338 --> 33:27.298
missing wife case
when we've got an ongoing

33:27.340 --> 33:28.967
bomb threat here against kids?

33:29.009 --> 33:30.218
- Because they are related.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.512
I believe the Serra boy has
more information

33:32.554 --> 33:33.805
about the bomb.

33:33.847 --> 33:37.183
The calls to the day care
are coming from a woman.

33:37.225 --> 33:40.437
Maybe it's less
about implicating his father

33:40.478 --> 33:43.231
than protecting his mother.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.568
- Good answer.

33:46.609 --> 33:48.319
You run Elisabeth Serra's
background?

33:48.361 --> 33:49.696
- I can.

33:49.738 --> 33:50.905
- Okay, check the neighbors.

33:50.947 --> 33:52.282
- None of this makes sense
to me.

33:52.323 --> 33:54.826
- Well, Earl,
should this next bomb be real,

33:54.868 --> 33:56.911
that's not the statement
that I want to lead with,

33:56.953 --> 33:59.039
that none of it makes sense.

34:01.666 --> 34:03.960
- Okay, so you think that
Danny's parents are involved

34:04.002 --> 34:05.879
in the bomb?

34:05.920 --> 34:08.381
- I see a lot of emotion.

34:08.423 --> 34:12.135
His son imagines he has
another, better father.

34:12.177 --> 34:15.555
He was angry, and she's gone.

34:15.597 --> 34:17.724
- Yeah, but I just can't
see him doing anything

34:17.766 --> 34:19.684
to scare his boys.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.353
Or hurt anybody, frankly.

34:21.394 --> 34:23.772
I mean, he's a big guy
with a big heart,

34:23.813 --> 34:27.150
and kids can have
crazy imaginations, you know?

34:27.192 --> 34:29.694
- Yes, but there's more
to be mined here.

34:29.736 --> 34:31.154
I'm gonna go back.
- More to be mined

34:31.196 --> 34:33.073
with Danny, the father?

34:33.114 --> 34:35.241
- And Elisabeth.

34:38.995 --> 34:44.376
- Avi, why did you never look
into your dad's murder case?

34:44.417 --> 34:47.420
- Janine, please.
- Okay, understood.

34:49.798 --> 34:51.800
But the th--
um, the thing is that--

34:51.841 --> 34:54.386
[clears throat]
You probably don't need

34:54.427 --> 34:56.221
to hear this, but...

34:57.597 --> 35:00.058
Last night, when we were
talking about your dad,

35:00.100 --> 35:03.103
I held your hand

35:03.144 --> 35:05.397
as an expression of sympathy

35:05.438 --> 35:08.108
to comfort you, like I would
with any crime victim,

35:08.149 --> 35:09.901
which is what you are, Avi.

35:09.943 --> 35:12.070
You're a crime victim.

35:12.112 --> 35:16.241
And so
if you misinterpreted that

35:16.282 --> 35:18.785
as something else,

35:18.827 --> 35:20.161
I'm really sorry.

35:20.203 --> 35:22.205
That was not my intention
at all.

35:22.247 --> 35:24.749
- I'm--I--

35:24.791 --> 35:27.335
I interpreted it as--
as a gesture to comfort me

35:27.377 --> 35:31.172
and, um,
to express sorrow for my loss.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.261
- Okay, good.

35:36.302 --> 35:37.554
- Yeah, good.
I'm--

35:37.595 --> 35:38.888
- Good.

35:40.849 --> 35:42.017
- Good.

35:42.058 --> 35:43.309
- Yep.

35:46.813 --> 35:48.398
- [sighs]

35:48.440 --> 35:51.609
[tense music]

35:51.651 --> 35:58.575
* *

36:09.502 --> 36:10.712
- I don't want
to get in trouble,

36:10.754 --> 36:12.213
you know,
but I-I-I also don't want

36:12.255 --> 36:15.925
to withhold information
'cause it's just too important.

36:15.967 --> 36:18.887
And I-I need my job.

36:18.928 --> 36:20.430
Thank you.

36:20.472 --> 36:23.767
And it's--it's possible
that I've gotten it wrong.

36:25.268 --> 36:26.895
- What is it you've come
to tell us, Sarah?

36:28.438 --> 36:31.983
- Well,
when we received the call,

36:32.025 --> 36:36.154
um, it was clear that she was
shocked by what was said.

36:36.196 --> 36:39.074
You know, don't get me wrong.
I s--I saw it in her face.

36:39.115 --> 36:40.700
- Anna?
- Yeah.

36:42.118 --> 36:44.079
But it's like, the more
that I go over it in my mind

36:44.120 --> 36:46.581
and the more that I think,

36:46.623 --> 36:48.667
she didn't ask who it was.

36:48.708 --> 36:51.002
She just said,
"This needs to stop."

36:51.044 --> 36:53.880
But she never asked who it was.

36:55.632 --> 36:58.134
I just--
I have this weird feeling

36:58.176 --> 37:02.347
that Anna knew
exactly who was calling.

37:02.389 --> 37:05.225
Just something
about her expression.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.601
She knew.

37:08.645 --> 37:12.691
- You think she knows
who's making these threats?

37:14.067 --> 37:16.194
- Yeah.

37:16.236 --> 37:19.447
- What? Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

37:19.489 --> 37:21.991
- If I knew who,
why wouldn't I say so?

37:22.033 --> 37:23.660
- This would be my question.

37:23.702 --> 37:26.955
- My God, what makes you think
that I would know who it was?

37:26.996 --> 37:29.165
- How would you describe
your overall relationship

37:29.207 --> 37:32.168
with the parents of these kids?

37:32.210 --> 37:33.878
- What difference
does that make?

37:33.920 --> 37:35.422
- [chuckles]

37:37.048 --> 37:40.343
Let me tell you what it is,
Ms. Harvey.

37:40.385 --> 37:42.470
You're not exactly
everybody's cup of tea.

37:42.512 --> 37:44.389
Some of these parents,
they don't like you.

37:44.431 --> 37:45.807
Now, whether or not
that rises to the level

37:45.849 --> 37:47.392
of someone trying to blow up
your place of business,

37:47.434 --> 37:49.728
I don't know, but what I can
tell you is this.

37:49.769 --> 37:53.356
It used to be,
when kids were in peril,

37:53.398 --> 37:55.859
folks dropped their differences
and came together to help out.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.611
Nowadays, they don't.

37:58.653 --> 38:00.572
Not even with kids getting
shot up in classrooms

38:00.613 --> 38:01.865
or out playing on the street.

38:05.577 --> 38:10.707
The kids in your day care
could be victims of a bombing.

38:10.749 --> 38:12.083
You're supposed
to be protecting them,

38:12.125 --> 38:13.668
and you're not.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.587
You're holding something back.

38:15.628 --> 38:16.921
And that doesn't
just puzzle me.

38:16.963 --> 38:18.548
It pisses me off.

38:18.590 --> 38:21.509
[tense music]

38:21.551 --> 38:28.683
* *

38:32.812 --> 38:34.022
- Look,
what do you want me to do?

38:34.064 --> 38:35.440
- Keep your voice down.
The boys are asleep.

38:35.482 --> 38:36.941
- I do the work.

38:36.983 --> 38:39.819
I can't make these fuckers
pay their bills on time.

38:39.861 --> 38:41.738
Fucking billionaires are always
stiffing the contractors.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.365
- You gotta push them.
- Why?

38:43.406 --> 38:45.992
Why should I have to beg these
assholes to do the right thing?

38:46.034 --> 38:47.535
Lord knows they got
the fucking money.

38:47.577 --> 38:49.120
- How do you think
they got rich?

38:49.162 --> 38:51.122
By not paying their bills
until they have to.

38:51.164 --> 38:52.582
And not taking it personally.

38:52.624 --> 38:54.084
It's just business.
- What's that supposed to mean?

38:54.125 --> 38:57.128
- Asking for what you deserve
is not begging.

38:57.170 --> 38:59.005
It's standing up for yourself
and your family.

38:59.047 --> 39:01.216
- You think I don't stand up
for this family?

39:01.257 --> 39:04.302
Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

39:04.344 --> 39:07.138
[both sigh]

39:07.180 --> 39:09.432
Paul...

39:09.474 --> 39:12.143
you gotta do better.

39:12.185 --> 39:14.521
We got our own bills to pay.

39:29.202 --> 39:31.204
- You have a plan?
- Yes.

39:31.246 --> 39:34.708
We jump in the river
and see where it takes us.

39:34.749 --> 39:35.875
- Ah.

39:38.878 --> 39:41.840
- Look, I know I said
the bomb was fake

39:41.881 --> 39:43.883
and that we had words
with Anna,

39:43.925 --> 39:45.844
but I don't understand
why you're accusing me of this.

39:45.885 --> 39:47.637
- We're not accusing you,
Mr. Serra.

39:47.679 --> 39:50.015
Your son, Danny, seems to be.

39:50.056 --> 39:53.435
- Look, he's a good kid.

39:53.476 --> 39:55.478
He's a troubled kid.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.856
He doesn't really mean
that I did it.

39:57.897 --> 40:01.234
- I still don't understand
why Danny would be so angry

40:01.276 --> 40:02.610
to implicate his own father--

40:02.652 --> 40:04.362
- None of this is real.

40:04.404 --> 40:07.824
He does not have a first father
and a second father.

40:07.866 --> 40:09.701
He only has one father, me,

40:09.743 --> 40:11.411
and I haven't
done anything wrong.

40:12.871 --> 40:15.248
- You say that Danny has
a therapist.

40:15.290 --> 40:17.334
Could we speak to him or her?

40:17.375 --> 40:18.585
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

40:18.626 --> 40:20.211
I can tell you what she'll say.

40:20.253 --> 40:21.463
- Which is what?

40:21.504 --> 40:23.131
- Exactly what I already
told you.

40:23.173 --> 40:25.091
That he's mad at me
because his mother's gone.

40:25.133 --> 40:27.635
She left because of me.
I'm the bad guy.

40:27.677 --> 40:29.346
- And you've tried
getting in touch with her?

40:29.387 --> 40:31.431
- Yeah, I called
her parents in Mexico.

40:31.473 --> 40:33.183
I-I called her sister
in New Jersey.

40:33.224 --> 40:35.435
We don't know where she is.

40:38.772 --> 40:41.274
- Is there another man
in Elisabeth's life?

40:41.316 --> 40:43.193
[tense music]

40:43.234 --> 40:45.153
- No.

40:45.195 --> 40:46.613
I-I don't know.

40:46.654 --> 40:49.240
- Can you make room
for the possibility?

40:49.282 --> 40:53.161
* *

40:53.203 --> 40:56.247
Has there been infidelity
in your marriage, Mr. Serra--

40:56.289 --> 40:57.957
- Not from my side, all right?

40:57.999 --> 40:59.959
Or hers.

41:00.001 --> 41:02.462
I ca--I ca--I can't
believe that there was.

41:02.504 --> 41:03.963
No way.

41:07.467 --> 41:10.095
- Your wife has a job?

41:10.136 --> 41:11.596
- Yeah.

41:11.638 --> 41:15.475
She's an event planner
at the Valley Forge Club.

41:15.517 --> 41:17.769
- That's a very nice place.
- Yeah.

41:17.811 --> 41:19.771
- When she left,
your wife said she was done.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.981
Did she actually tell you
she was leaving you?

41:22.023 --> 41:23.400
- No.

41:23.441 --> 41:26.111
She packed a bag, and she just
walked out the door.

41:26.152 --> 41:28.238
Like I said,
she's done it before.

41:28.279 --> 41:29.614
She always comes back,

41:29.656 --> 41:31.783
and this time...

41:31.825 --> 41:34.703
- Well, we spoke
with some of the neighbors,

41:34.744 --> 41:37.330
Danny's teachers,
Eric's teachers at school.

41:37.372 --> 41:40.458
They all described Elisabeth
as a very devoted mother.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.960
- She is.

41:42.002 --> 41:43.712
- Does it make sense to you
that she would

41:43.753 --> 41:46.464
leave her children
and not say goodbye?

41:46.506 --> 41:48.174
- No.

41:49.634 --> 41:52.512
- A week.

41:52.554 --> 41:55.640
One could even conclude
she's missing.

41:55.682 --> 41:58.184
You haven't concluded that.

41:58.226 --> 41:59.728
She didn't say goodbye.

41:59.769 --> 42:03.690
She hasn't called.
Nothing.

42:03.732 --> 42:07.610
And she left without a word
to her children.

42:07.652 --> 42:09.446
Those two boys love her.

42:09.487 --> 42:11.656
They rely on her.

42:11.698 --> 42:14.868
They know she would never
abandon them.

42:14.909 --> 42:18.413
And this leads me
to the inevitable question.

42:18.455 --> 42:20.540
Mr. Serra...

42:22.584 --> 42:25.378
What have you done
to your wife?

42:25.420 --> 42:30.550
* *
