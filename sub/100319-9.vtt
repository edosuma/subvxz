WEBVTT

00:06.289 --> 00:08.381
Thanks for letting me make
breakfast at your place.

00:08.406 --> 00:10.475
Mm, and eat my food?

00:10.500 --> 00:11.851
That, too.

00:12.319 --> 00:14.297
I will go to the supermarket...

00:14.322 --> 00:15.990
one day. How's it going in there?

00:16.015 --> 00:17.437
Not good. You know,

00:17.462 --> 00:20.049
the reason why I pulled out
all of my old workout equipment

00:20.074 --> 00:22.304
and this sublime '80s aerobic video

00:22.329 --> 00:24.907
was to get your endorphins
up to make you feel better,

00:24.932 --> 00:26.764
and you're in there scrambing eggs.

00:26.789 --> 00:29.162
I am too depressed to exercise, Mo.

00:29.187 --> 00:30.860
I ruined my entire life yesterday.

00:30.884 --> 00:31.938
At least that whole singing

00:31.962 --> 00:33.687
your feelings out
loud thing's over, right?

00:33.712 --> 00:36.725
Yeah, my powers seem
to be back to normal.

00:36.750 --> 00:40.835
I mean, if you call a neighbor
heart-singing "Umbrella"

00:40.860 --> 00:43.819
as they step out into the rain normal.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.376
- I just call that uninspired.
- I have no idea

00:46.400 --> 00:48.491
what I'm supposed to say
to Max and Simon today.

00:48.516 --> 00:52.866
Is it possible to have feelings
for two guys at the same time?

00:52.891 --> 00:54.718
Absolutely. I liked two guys once.

00:54.742 --> 00:56.886
One was named Byron.
The other one was named Bryan.

00:56.910 --> 00:58.288
It got very complicated.

00:58.312 --> 00:59.823
I just feel like the universe

00:59.847 --> 01:01.985
keeps pointing me to Max,
but if that's the case,

01:02.010 --> 01:04.577
then why can't I stop
thinking about Simon?

01:04.602 --> 01:05.995
Because the heart song wants

01:06.019 --> 01:07.749
what the heart song wants, my love.

01:07.774 --> 01:10.157
And I want Simon to want me.

01:10.317 --> 01:11.667
I do.

01:11.692 --> 01:12.936
And I know I shouldn't, because...

01:12.960 --> 01:14.211
He's an engaged man?

01:14.236 --> 01:16.225
- He doesn't kiss like one.
- No, he does not,

01:16.250 --> 01:17.741
which is why I need to
know what he's thinking.

01:17.765 --> 01:19.994
Well, then, go ask him,
and stop torturing you and me,

01:20.019 --> 01:21.964
and go get the clarity you and we need.

01:22.534 --> 01:24.032
Good idea.

01:28.601 --> 01:30.468
I'm gonna go visit my dad.

01:31.444 --> 01:32.780
And then after,

01:34.040 --> 01:36.430
I am gonna go get clarity from Simon.

01:36.683 --> 01:38.328
At least then I know where I stand.

01:38.352 --> 01:40.788
Watch your st... ep.

01:40.813 --> 01:42.599
My old Thighmaster is down there

01:42.623 --> 01:45.168
and my Shake Weight and my ab roller.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.823
Oh, I should really stop watching QVC.

01:46.848 --> 01:49.266
- My finger.
- I'ma get you some ice.

01:50.998 --> 01:52.542
Hi, Maggie.

01:52.566 --> 01:54.680
Here's the air mattress
you asked to borrow.

01:54.705 --> 01:56.616
Thank you, Emily.

01:56.641 --> 01:58.100
Full disclosure:

01:58.125 --> 02:00.295
David and I bought it
for a fun camping trip,

02:00.320 --> 02:04.243
and then we both realized
we hate camping and fun.

02:04.485 --> 02:06.593
Well, anything is better

02:06.618 --> 02:08.458
than the office chair
I've been sleeping in

02:08.482 --> 02:10.686
for the last week and a half.

02:10.711 --> 02:12.811
Do you really have to keep
doing this to yourself?

02:12.836 --> 02:15.799
Mitch and I have slept
in the same bed together

02:15.823 --> 02:20.369
for over 40 years,
and it would just feel

02:20.394 --> 02:23.339
too strange to not be in
the same room with him.

02:23.363 --> 02:25.921
Well, how about having Howie
carry him up the stairs?

02:25.946 --> 02:28.508
Yeah, it would be so
horrible if he fell again,

02:28.533 --> 02:33.015
and I think that Mitch feels
that being carried is...

02:33.040 --> 02:35.717
... is too demeaning.
But I'm not complaining.

02:35.742 --> 02:37.843
I don't want to miss a single moment.

02:37.868 --> 02:39.589
Well, I think it's really beautiful,

02:39.613 --> 02:41.969
the lengths you're willing to
go to sleep with your husband.

02:41.993 --> 02:44.661
I kicked David out of our
room three times last week

02:44.685 --> 02:47.030
because his feet touched mine.

02:47.054 --> 02:48.398
Well, you never know.

02:48.422 --> 02:51.235
One of these days,
you might miss those feet.

02:51.757 --> 02:55.437
Intimacy is very
important in a marriage.

02:55.462 --> 02:58.141
It's maybe the most important thing.

02:59.087 --> 03:02.444
So you would say it's a bad sign then

03:02.469 --> 03:05.936
that David and I haven't had sex in...

03:05.961 --> 03:08.550
- In months?
- Well, it ain't great.

03:08.575 --> 03:11.020
I'm just used to David
being the one who initiates,

03:11.044 --> 03:14.524
and he hasn't really
done that in a while.

03:14.548 --> 03:17.193
Emily, come on. You're a modern woman.

03:17.217 --> 03:18.528
Don't wait for him.

03:18.552 --> 03:21.290
You gotta just tell him what you want.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.297
Hey, Dad.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.641
How you feeling this morning?

03:38.407 --> 03:40.250
Be warned.

03:40.274 --> 03:42.552
I'm gonna start dropping by more often.

03:42.576 --> 03:44.721
I need to absorb your natural positivity

03:44.745 --> 03:47.204
and feed off of it like
a grumpy vampire.

03:47.581 --> 03:49.202
Hey, Zoey. How's it going?

03:49.227 --> 03:51.261
Uh, honestly?

03:51.285 --> 03:52.962
I think I'm broken.

03:53.211 --> 03:56.415
Is that duct tape and a popsicle stick?

03:56.440 --> 03:58.649
- Yep.
- It's resourceful, but useless.

03:58.674 --> 03:59.930
May I?

04:01.260 --> 04:02.571
Ow. Ow, ow, ow.

04:02.596 --> 04:05.882
Oof, inflammation in the extensor tendon

04:05.907 --> 04:08.578
at the MCP joint. How'd that happen?

04:08.602 --> 04:11.581
I, uh, tripped over an exercise device.

04:11.605 --> 04:14.584
I tried to break my fall
on a taxidermied peacock,

04:14.608 --> 04:16.653
but I landed on a disco ball instead.

04:16.677 --> 04:18.954
Wow, your gym sounds amazing.

04:18.978 --> 04:24.046
Well, I don't think it's broken,
but you jammed it pretty good.

04:24.071 --> 04:27.196
I'll just immobilize it
with this actual splint,

04:27.220 --> 04:30.133
and that should do the trick.

04:30.157 --> 04:31.656
Thank you.

04:32.893 --> 04:34.210
"My turn"?

04:34.235 --> 04:36.472
We have a ritual that we've been doing

04:36.496 --> 04:39.469
ever since I could walk
and fall and hurt myself.

04:45.171 --> 04:46.577
Thank you.

04:46.602 --> 04:50.360
The crazy thing is, it actually works.

04:51.144 --> 04:52.643
I guess dads just have a way

04:52.668 --> 04:54.368
of making you feel better, you know?

04:56.249 --> 04:58.485
I left something on the stove.

05:00.153 --> 05:01.716
What did I say?

05:06.026 --> 05:09.727
♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪

05:10.690 --> 05:14.352

06:43.798 --> 06:47.579
So I just heard Howie sing...

06:48.077 --> 06:50.200
and you joined in with him.

06:50.225 --> 06:52.258
Does that mean you know what's going on?

06:59.426 --> 07:00.757
"Daughter."

07:02.354 --> 07:03.885
Howie's got a daughter?

07:04.211 --> 07:06.187
And they're having some issues?

07:08.313 --> 07:11.368
And you want me to
do something about it?

07:11.393 --> 07:13.094
_

07:13.766 --> 07:15.990
Well, how can I say no to that?

07:18.329 --> 07:19.434
You hungry?

07:19.459 --> 07:21.446
I make a mean fluffernutter.

07:21.471 --> 07:22.921
I'll take a rain check.

07:22.946 --> 07:27.510
But is something bothering
you with a family member,

07:27.534 --> 07:29.905
possibly of the daughter persuasion?

07:29.930 --> 07:31.891
Your pop said something, huh?

07:32.090 --> 07:35.169
Look, I am here
to make your lives easier,

07:35.194 --> 07:37.878
- not the other way around.
- But maybe I can help you.

07:37.903 --> 07:40.622
You have a daughter. I am a daughter.

07:40.647 --> 07:42.833
Plus, I owe you.

07:43.821 --> 07:46.066
It's just seeing you and Mitch

07:46.091 --> 07:49.042
kinda reminds me of me
and my kid, Abigail,

07:49.067 --> 07:50.980
or at least the way we used to be.

07:51.005 --> 07:53.214
She's a senior at Berkeley.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.671
We had a little dust-up
a few months back

07:55.695 --> 07:57.934
and haven't talked since.

07:57.959 --> 07:59.606
Not a word? Nothing?

07:59.631 --> 08:00.817
Silence.

08:00.841 --> 08:02.578
She doesn't want anything to do with me.

08:02.606 --> 08:04.980
Maybe things have calmed down a bit,

08:05.005 --> 08:07.183
and it couldn't hurt to reach out again?

08:07.207 --> 08:10.219
Besides, no matter how angry we get...

08:10.794 --> 08:13.512
daughters always love their fathers.

08:13.537 --> 08:15.190
Maybe.

08:15.348 --> 08:18.456
Man, I can't believe
your dad ratted me out.

08:18.481 --> 08:21.831
The whole reason I like taking
care of patients like him

08:21.855 --> 08:23.947
is they're good at keeping secrets.

08:25.025 --> 08:27.497
You are lucky I like you, buddy.

08:32.948 --> 08:34.433
Hey.

08:38.841 --> 08:41.778
How'd it go with your dad last night?

08:42.042 --> 08:43.686
It was...

08:43.801 --> 08:46.198
emotional, but necessary.

08:46.223 --> 08:50.261
Thank you for encouraging me
to go over there and face him.

08:50.286 --> 08:51.723
Sure.

08:52.219 --> 08:55.974
Also, I'm not singing
all my feelings anymore.

08:55.999 --> 08:57.810
That's great.

08:57.989 --> 09:00.936
Right on back to reading
other people's souls then,

09:00.961 --> 09:02.761
whether they want you to or not.

09:04.331 --> 09:06.277
Oh, you're gonna love this.

09:06.302 --> 09:08.144
Leif just called in sick the same day

09:08.168 --> 09:10.419
Joan is out of the office
for a tech conference.

09:10.444 --> 09:12.121
Great.

09:12.146 --> 09:14.519
Now, do we think that's
a total coincidence, or...

09:14.544 --> 09:15.803
You know, I'm really trying not to think

09:15.827 --> 09:17.732
about anybody else's romantic feelings

09:17.757 --> 09:22.090
for anybody else right now,
but, uh, you do you.

09:22.115 --> 09:23.544
Simon.

09:25.076 --> 09:27.091
Could I talk to you for a sec?

09:29.770 --> 09:33.669
I, uh, wanted to talk
to you about the kiss.

09:33.864 --> 09:37.339
You know, our kiss,
the one that happened

09:37.364 --> 09:40.300
after I sang "I Want You to Want Me"
to you yesterday.

09:40.325 --> 09:42.309
Yes, I remember it.

09:43.565 --> 09:45.448
And I actually wanted to
talk to you about it, too.

09:45.472 --> 09:47.040
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

09:47.065 --> 09:49.047
So maybe you could go first,

09:49.072 --> 09:52.755
just so I can get a sense
of how you're thinking

09:52.779 --> 09:55.791
about this whole crazy thing.

09:55.815 --> 09:57.760
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:57.784 --> 10:00.594
Um, I made a mistake,

10:00.619 --> 10:02.865
as in, it was inappropriate
of me to do that.

10:02.890 --> 10:05.034
Um, you just sang those words

10:05.058 --> 10:09.005
and did that thing
on the floor, very hot.

10:09.029 --> 10:12.357
Uh, I got lost in the moment,
and it shouldn't have happened.

10:12.382 --> 10:14.310
But it happened.

10:14.334 --> 10:16.694
And I-I mean...

10:17.137 --> 10:18.948
I feel like we both wanted it to happen.

10:18.972 --> 10:21.099
Clearly we have a connection,

10:21.124 --> 10:23.119
but it's definitely not a
connection that I should have,

10:23.143 --> 10:24.720
based on my current relationship status.

10:24.744 --> 10:26.989
So, as much as we do connect...

10:27.013 --> 10:29.233
And I like connecting with you a lot...

10:29.258 --> 10:32.659
It's probably best that we don't
connect like that anymore...

10:34.341 --> 10:36.022
I don't think.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.241
Right?

10:38.413 --> 10:41.546
Uh, thank you for the clarity.

10:48.068 --> 10:50.122
Well, that didn't clarify...

10:50.890 --> 10:54.072
Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie
www.addic7ed.com

11:02.010 --> 11:03.522
Wow.

11:03.971 --> 11:06.249
What exactly is going on in here?

11:06.611 --> 11:09.855
A creative inspiration or
a massive cry for help?

11:09.880 --> 11:13.526
I took my microwave apart
just to put it back together.

11:14.849 --> 11:16.918
Usually makes me feel better...

11:16.943 --> 11:19.200
- Ever try a facial?
- But it's not working.

11:19.225 --> 11:22.021
'Cause even if I fix this,
I can't fix me, Mo.

11:22.046 --> 11:23.896
I'm broken, and I'm gonna die alone.

11:23.921 --> 11:25.966
So I take it that conversation
with Simon went well?

11:25.991 --> 11:28.870
He has no clue what he wants.

11:28.895 --> 11:30.473
He's just as confused as ever,

11:30.498 --> 11:32.476
which, in a weird way,
might actually be worse

11:32.501 --> 11:35.044
than him just saying he
doesn't want to be with me.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.786
Mm, I hate a wishy-washy man.

11:37.811 --> 11:39.325
Byron was the same way.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.854
Or was it Bryan?

11:40.879 --> 11:42.357
Here goes nothing.

11:44.559 --> 11:46.747
- Well, you were right about that.
- Great.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.224
Now I'm gonna starve to death, too.

11:50.249 --> 11:52.630
All my life,
I've dealt with men like Simon,

11:52.655 --> 11:55.935
and what he's doing to you
and his fiancée isn't right.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.622
Eddie invited him and Jessica
over for brunch tomorrow.

11:58.647 --> 12:00.725
The player thinks he's
coming for a piece of quiche,

12:00.750 --> 12:03.333
but he's gonna get a
piece of my mind instead.

12:03.358 --> 12:05.903
Whatever. I mean, I appreciate it,

12:05.928 --> 12:07.573
but I doubt anything's gonna change.

12:07.598 --> 12:08.776
I'm gonna scare that boy straight.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.091
Now, take a shower.

12:10.116 --> 12:12.349
You smell like frozen
burritos and Hot Pockets.

12:12.374 --> 12:15.575
I did eat both of those things
before I destroyed this.

12:22.599 --> 12:24.197
Maxwell Richman.

12:24.222 --> 12:26.239
Uh, hi.

12:26.264 --> 12:28.368
Ava Price, sixth floor.

12:28.393 --> 12:31.302
Oh. Yeah, I know who you are.

12:31.327 --> 12:33.333
I'm just surprised you know my name.

12:33.358 --> 12:34.506
I make it my business to know

12:34.530 --> 12:36.974
all the star players
at Sprq Point, Maxwell.

12:36.999 --> 12:38.286
And I'm one of them?

12:38.311 --> 12:40.669
I'd like to meet with
you tomorrow up on six.

12:40.694 --> 12:43.091
- How's 11:00 A.M. sharp?
- May I ask why?

12:43.116 --> 12:44.584
- I ask the questions.
- Okay.

12:44.609 --> 12:46.130
But isn't tomorrow Saturday?

12:46.155 --> 12:48.767
Oh, let me de-question that.
Tomorrow's Saturday.

12:48.792 --> 12:51.257
Coming in on your day off
will be well worth your while.

12:51.497 --> 12:53.302
Well, even so,
I don't have security access

12:53.327 --> 12:55.527
- to the sixth floor.
- Check your left pocket.

12:56.247 --> 12:57.755
What?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.442
Okay, that's very impressive.

13:09.496 --> 13:11.552
So what is all of this?

13:11.577 --> 13:15.153
Uh, this is Dad's will, uh,
his medical directives,

13:15.178 --> 13:17.427
power of attorney, all the fun stuff.

13:17.452 --> 13:19.935
It's pretty weird seeing it
all laid out like this...

13:20.871 --> 13:23.005
his whole life on our kitchen table.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.008
You know, the sad part is,
is that he's...

13:25.033 --> 13:27.036
He's giving me everything.

13:27.061 --> 13:30.660
You get the fishing rod,
a lamp, and a couple of belts.

13:30.919 --> 13:32.130
Is that true?

13:32.155 --> 13:33.693
No, it's not true.
I'm just joking around.

13:33.717 --> 13:35.825
I'm trying to stop myself
from feeling something.

13:36.185 --> 13:38.083
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.630
Can we go home? I'm ready for bed.

13:40.655 --> 13:41.966
Bed? What are you talking about?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.731
You... you feel sick?
It's still so early.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.919
No, I'm fine. It's just...

13:45.944 --> 13:49.599
we haven't really had a
lot of alone time lately.

13:49.624 --> 13:51.942
Doesn't alone time for you mean a bath,

13:51.967 --> 13:53.812
a book, and "Don't bother me"?

13:53.837 --> 13:56.464
- Yeah, usually, but...
- Yeah. Uh, you know,

13:56.489 --> 13:58.131
I'll be home in a bit.
I just... I really gotta stay on this

13:58.155 --> 14:00.239
and make sure
everything's up to date, okay?

14:01.695 --> 14:03.911
Okay, fine.

Just know you have a window,

15:10.876 --> 15:12.465
What did that mean?

15:12.490 --> 15:15.836
If I had to guess, mama wants some.

15:15.928 --> 15:18.491
That is a very strange thing
that I just said to my brother.

15:18.516 --> 15:21.084
So, um, can you take care of that

15:21.109 --> 15:23.772
while I go curse my existence elsewhere?

15:26.233 --> 15:29.428
- Hey, how's your finger?
- Still hurts.

15:29.453 --> 15:32.678
Then I guess you are better at
this caregiver stuff than me.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.928
Because of you,
I reached out to my daughter.

15:36.953 --> 15:38.224
And how'd it go?

15:38.249 --> 15:40.545
Awesomely super fantastic

15:40.570 --> 15:41.913
when I mentioned you.

15:41.938 --> 15:43.936
Why would you mention me?

15:43.961 --> 15:46.436
Abigail is a computer science major,

15:46.461 --> 15:49.435
so maybe I thought I
could get her attention

15:49.460 --> 15:51.781
if I said that the daughter of
the family that I'm working for

15:51.805 --> 15:54.873
works at Sprq Point and
that maybe you'd be open

15:54.898 --> 15:56.905
to meet with Abigail
if she wrote me back.

15:56.930 --> 15:59.459
And maybe if you took
out all of those maybes,

15:59.484 --> 16:01.178
that's exactly what I did.

16:01.203 --> 16:03.077
So I was a bargaining chip?

16:03.102 --> 16:04.147
I'm sorry, Zoey.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.498
But, if you visit her with me,

16:06.523 --> 16:08.311
I will give you anything you want.

16:08.336 --> 16:10.772
Flat-screen TV? Ferrari?

16:10.944 --> 16:13.869
I'm lying, I can really only
afford a medium fro-yo.

16:13.894 --> 16:16.027
Mm.

16:20.725 --> 16:22.725
Then let's go to college.

16:23.296 --> 16:26.044
We're looking for Sather Gate,
Sather Hall or Sather comments.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.843
Who is this Sather guy,
and exactly how rich was he?

16:29.006 --> 16:30.309
Whoop! Incoming.

16:30.334 --> 16:32.786
Whoa. Nice reflexes.

16:33.077 --> 16:34.661
Did you play ultimate in college?

16:34.686 --> 16:37.739
No, I played duck the
shrapnel in Afghanistan.

16:37.764 --> 16:38.876
Did you really?

16:38.900 --> 16:41.123
I was a field medic, three tours.

16:41.403 --> 16:42.584
Wow.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.934
- You must have seen...
- Some stuff?

16:44.959 --> 16:46.661
Yeah, you could say that.

16:46.686 --> 16:48.185
How do you go through all that suffering

16:48.209 --> 16:51.380
and not let it break you?

16:51.405 --> 16:53.557
You're always so positive and...

16:53.581 --> 16:56.894
Joyful, even when things are
pretty bleak with my dad.

16:56.918 --> 16:58.462
Your dad's one of the lucky ones.

16:58.486 --> 17:01.411
He's had an awesome life, you know,

17:01.436 --> 17:04.300
with a happy home,
a family who's crazy about him.

17:04.325 --> 17:05.835
I lost friends who weren't old enough

17:05.859 --> 17:08.551
to sip their first beer...
Well, legally at least.

17:08.577 --> 17:11.474
Yeah, I get that.
It's just hard to maintain perspective

17:11.499 --> 17:13.983
when you're living with
someone dying every day.

17:14.233 --> 17:18.194
One of the reasons I
love caregiving so much

17:18.219 --> 17:22.886
is it shows me what an
insane gift all of this is,

17:22.911 --> 17:26.257
just walking around on our own
two feet, you know,

17:26.281 --> 17:30.709
making our own choices,
breathing our own breaths.

17:35.190 --> 17:36.667
Are you getting a whiff of that?

17:36.691 --> 17:38.569
Sweet, sweet Kush.

17:38.593 --> 17:41.160
Maybe I should've
gone to college instead.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.420
- You are bad.
- You can try to twist her arm.

17:45.445 --> 17:48.045
- One ounce, she's...
- I never do anything without you.

17:48.725 --> 17:50.680
- Here you are, darlings.
- Thank you.

17:50.705 --> 17:52.194
Gosh, I really love the vibe in here.

17:52.219 --> 17:54.284
- How would you describe it?
- "Lady and the Tramp"

17:54.309 --> 17:56.677
meets Lady Bird Johnson
meets "Lady Marmalade."

17:56.702 --> 17:58.389
I love that video. I used to know

17:58.413 --> 17:59.929
all the choreography when I was younger.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.084
Is that going to be the song

18:01.109 --> 18:02.753
for the first dance at your wedding?

18:02.778 --> 18:06.108
Because you should probably save
those moves for the honeymoon.

18:08.113 --> 18:10.661
Speaking of your big day, when is it?

18:10.686 --> 18:12.368
We haven't gotten our save-the-date yet.

18:12.393 --> 18:15.497
- Oh, well, it...
- We are not sure yet.

18:15.522 --> 18:16.874
Still trying to find a-a venue.

18:16.898 --> 18:19.450
Dates, really lock it in.

18:19.475 --> 18:21.078
But it would be helpful
in terms of planning

18:21.102 --> 18:22.780
to just make a decision already.

18:23.053 --> 18:24.927
Still so much to figure out.

18:24.952 --> 18:26.705
Mm-hmm. Definitely.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.430
Gotta do that.

18:30.186 --> 18:32.006
All right, does anyone
need any help in the kitchen?

18:32.030 --> 18:34.177
- Mm-mm.
- Uh, no, we got it.

18:34.202 --> 18:36.560
Come on, Jess.
Let's go check on the quiche,

18:36.584 --> 18:39.708
which is really just code for
"I need another mimosa."

18:40.898 --> 18:42.559
Do you remember that time when...

18:42.584 --> 18:44.302
What in the hell are you doing?

18:44.327 --> 18:45.770
- What do you mean?
- Don't play games.

18:45.794 --> 18:46.898
You've done enough of that with Zoey.

18:46.922 --> 18:48.803
She told me you two kissed.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.452
- She told you that?
- Of course she did.

18:50.477 --> 18:53.522
We're joined at the hip.
Now, move. Now. Go. Uh...

18:56.108 --> 18:58.473
It just happened.

18:58.498 --> 19:00.084
You have been having an emotional affair

19:00.108 --> 19:01.747
with this girl for months now,

19:01.772 --> 19:03.716
texting her, leaning on her,

19:03.741 --> 19:05.755
showing up to her
apartment late at night.

19:05.780 --> 19:07.210
- Whoa...
- And whatever it is you think

19:07.234 --> 19:09.926
you are doing to her and that
beautiful bride-to-be of yours

19:09.951 --> 19:12.022
in the next room is unacceptable.

19:12.164 --> 19:13.625
You're right, Mo.

19:14.179 --> 19:16.039
It's just, Zoey and I connect

19:16.074 --> 19:20.797
on this very deep level,
many levels actually,

19:20.822 --> 19:23.133
and there's a lot of
emotions tied up in that,

19:23.158 --> 19:24.556
many of which I don't want to go into,

19:24.580 --> 19:26.102
because it makes feel like a bad person,

19:26.126 --> 19:28.047
which I'm not, Mo.

19:29.070 --> 19:31.875
If I was, I would not care
about the feelings

19:31.900 --> 19:33.726
of that incredible woman in there

19:34.344 --> 19:37.687
who has tried very hard

19:37.712 --> 19:39.890
to help me through a very tough time.

19:40.114 --> 19:41.796
It's just...

19:44.320 --> 19:46.390
I don't know what to do...

19:47.602 --> 19:50.080
and it's tearing me up inside.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.588
I-I can't eat, I can't sleep,
and I never meant

19:52.613 --> 19:54.655
- to hurt anybody. It...
- Hey.

19:55.599 --> 20:00.580
I understand,
but hurt people hurt people,

20:00.605 --> 20:04.073
and you really need to figure this out.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.594
Welcome to the sixth floor, Maxwell.

20:30.065 --> 20:31.442
Thank you.

20:31.467 --> 20:33.687
Uh, but I'm...
You could just call me Max.

20:33.712 --> 20:35.734
I don't do nicknames.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.898
Quite the upgrade up here,
don't you think?

20:37.923 --> 20:41.169
Yeah, it's just like
the fourth floor, only more...

20:41.194 --> 20:42.939
- ... terrifying?
- That's by design,

20:42.964 --> 20:46.094
but I'm thinking it might be
time for a mood change up here.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.555
Everyone was very impressed

20:47.580 --> 20:50.062
by your participation in
The Chirp presentation.

20:50.087 --> 20:52.086
Oh, yeah. Well,
I was just kinda winging it.

20:52.111 --> 20:53.352
Well, your off-the-cuff attitude

20:53.376 --> 20:55.754
and bold creative vision are
exactly what we're missing.

20:55.779 --> 20:57.414
Sure, my team is good,

20:57.439 --> 21:00.812
but they lack your
specific right-brain flair.

21:00.837 --> 21:02.914
You designed the escape
room at the holiday party

21:02.939 --> 21:04.250
that no one could get out of.

21:04.275 --> 21:06.578
Franklin Yang had a nervous breakdown.

21:06.603 --> 21:08.242
Oh, yeah. He got fired that day.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.437
I think the escape room just
kinda put it over the top.

21:10.462 --> 21:12.906
Either way, I'd like to offer you

21:12.931 --> 21:15.601
the chance to manage your own team.

21:15.958 --> 21:17.430
I'm sorry.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.287
You want me?

21:19.312 --> 21:21.875
I want you to come up
here and shake things up.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.930
I want you to bring
your joy and your spirit

21:24.955 --> 21:28.406
and help me bring out
everyone's individual flair.

21:28.431 --> 21:31.250
Well, I'm very flattered

21:31.275 --> 21:33.469
that you think I could
do all those things,

21:33.494 --> 21:36.706
but I hadn't really
planned on making a move.

21:36.731 --> 21:39.744
I mean, uh, things are pretty
fine for me on the fourth floor.

21:39.769 --> 21:41.156
Are they?

21:41.824 --> 21:44.711
Or are you stuck treading water,

21:44.736 --> 21:47.367
waiting for something to
happen that maybe never will?

21:48.753 --> 21:50.390
Can I think about this?

21:50.415 --> 21:52.773
My offer is good for 72 hours.

21:52.798 --> 21:54.632
The clock starts now.

21:56.504 --> 21:58.416
Wow, it's so quiet.

21:58.441 --> 22:00.031
It's like the library,

22:00.056 --> 22:02.711
that I did not spend all
of my time in in college.

22:02.736 --> 22:05.234
Yeah, you're not gonna hear
a lot of talking in here.

22:05.259 --> 22:07.793
- How come?
- Because this is a deaf dorm.

22:14.908 --> 22:16.609
There she is.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.763
That's Abigail.

22:21.179 --> 22:23.804
- I don't speak sign language.
- No, it's okay.

22:23.829 --> 22:26.140
She can read lips, and I'll translate.

22:26.165 --> 22:27.663
Okay.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.397
Hey, Abby.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.116
It's been a while.

22:37.188 --> 22:39.374
I'm very happy to see you.

22:39.399 --> 22:43.561
Um, this is the famous
Zoey I texted you about.

22:43.586 --> 22:46.031
Hi. Nice shirt.

22:46.306 --> 22:49.585
I have a print of Ada Lovelace
hanging in my apartment.

22:49.938 --> 22:54.030
FYI, Ada was an
18th-century mathematician

22:54.055 --> 22:58.085
who is considered to be
one of the first coders.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.124
Love me some Lovelace.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.241
Same.

23:03.146 --> 23:06.202
Uh, it's very cool that
you work at Sprq Point.

23:06.227 --> 23:08.772
Have you thought about applying
to our internship program?

23:09.679 --> 23:11.444
I would love to

23:11.469 --> 23:13.647
once I'm back from Kenya.

23:13.672 --> 23:14.815
Amazing.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.084
What are you doing in Kenya?

23:16.109 --> 23:17.577
Wait. Kenya?

23:17.602 --> 23:20.834
Didn't we decide that you weren't
gonna go on that trip?

23:22.960 --> 23:25.733
I don't care if you got
a grant to pay for it.

23:27.344 --> 23:29.912
I'm setting up computers
at a school there,

23:29.937 --> 23:31.615
getting kids excited about STEM.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.694
I built a piece of software
that teaches them sign language

23:34.719 --> 23:35.889
while they learn English.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.162
That's so great,

23:37.187 --> 23:38.975
and it'll be amazing for your résumé,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.076
which you should definitely send me.

23:41.740 --> 23:44.498
Why would you hide this from me?

23:44.523 --> 23:46.787
How are you gonna get around Kenya?

23:46.812 --> 23:49.295
It's too risky for someone like you,

23:49.320 --> 23:51.022
and you're not going.

25:44.207 --> 25:46.218
I know you're angry.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.389
It's just...

25:53.017 --> 25:55.475
Do you need me to
translate that for you?

25:56.153 --> 25:58.873
Pretty sure I got the gist.

26:10.155 --> 26:12.005
Whoa, what's all this?

26:12.030 --> 26:14.641
Creative inspiration or
massive cry for help?

26:14.665 --> 26:16.643
These were organized by year,

26:16.667 --> 26:18.812
but I think I want to
organize them by color.

26:18.836 --> 26:21.936
Or should I go crazy
and do it by alphabet?

26:22.365 --> 26:24.239
Uh, no, I think
I'm gonna do it by color.

26:24.264 --> 26:25.986
Ooh. Do you want some tea?
I'm gonna get some tea.

26:26.010 --> 26:28.936
Oh, and banana bread.
Eddie made it. It's delicious.

26:28.961 --> 26:31.491
For your brunch? How was it?

26:31.516 --> 26:33.579
Did you talk to Simon?

26:33.604 --> 26:35.373
Read him the riot act?

26:35.903 --> 26:38.020
Chamomile or Earl Grey? You know what?

26:38.045 --> 26:39.265
You look like an Earl Grey kind of girl,

26:39.289 --> 26:41.529
so I'm gonna run to the store
and get you some real fast.

26:42.092 --> 26:43.736
Why are you running away from me?

26:43.761 --> 26:45.655
I think it's best if
you don't look at me

26:45.680 --> 26:48.255
or worry about and focus on
what I'm thinking or feeling.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.680
Uh-oh.

26:51.035 --> 26:52.280
Was it that bad?

26:52.305 --> 26:53.983
Not bad. I just told him

26:54.008 --> 26:57.570
that I didn't approve of his actions,
and he just, uh...

26:57.595 --> 26:59.100
He what?

26:59.295 --> 27:00.731
Listen, the truth is...

27:03.614 --> 27:07.247

27:07.272 --> 27:11.045

28:07.871 --> 28:09.704
I just sang to you, didn't I?

28:10.382 --> 28:12.241
Woman, when I want to go to the store,

28:12.266 --> 28:14.520
- let me go to the store.
- What changed with Simon?

28:14.545 --> 28:17.106
Because this is a completely
different you than yesterday.

28:17.131 --> 28:18.799
I don't want to make
this any more confusing

28:18.823 --> 28:21.535
than it already is,
but he is not a player.

28:21.559 --> 28:24.938
He's tortured by this,
and love is messy.

28:24.962 --> 28:26.773
And if you ask me my honest opinion,

28:26.797 --> 28:32.155
I think he's a sweet,
sensitive, very confused guy.

28:33.792 --> 28:36.530
And this is the first time I
don't have any advice for you.

28:39.810 --> 28:42.156
What... what are you?

28:42.381 --> 28:44.036
Ugh, where does this go?

28:44.061 --> 28:46.256
Hey, so it's been almost a day.

28:46.281 --> 28:48.239
Are you... Are you talking to me yet?

28:48.264 --> 28:50.522
'Cause I don't really know what I did...

28:50.547 --> 28:52.024
- Well...
- ... exactly.

28:52.049 --> 28:54.094
You came home last night
when I was already asleep,

28:54.119 --> 28:57.737
sat down next to me in bed,
and said, "Wanna do it?"

28:57.858 --> 28:59.506
It was a bad choice of words.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.795
It's just that Zoey told me
that you were in the mood,

29:01.820 --> 29:03.476
- so I thought...
- Zoey told you?

29:03.501 --> 29:05.114
I'm glad it's clearer

29:05.139 --> 29:06.713
coming from your sister
than your own wife.

29:06.737 --> 29:08.415
Well, I guess I'm just not used to you

29:08.439 --> 29:09.856
being forward like that.

29:09.881 --> 29:13.270
David, do you have any idea
how long it's been?

29:13.295 --> 29:15.342
Two months, three weeks, and four days.

29:15.519 --> 29:18.024
Or something like that. I don't know.

29:18.049 --> 29:19.991
So what's the problem? Are you...

29:20.834 --> 29:23.662
Are you not attracted
to me anymore or...

29:23.687 --> 29:26.232
Are you out of your mind? No.

29:26.257 --> 29:28.835
The opposite of that.
I'm extremely attracted to you.

29:28.859 --> 29:30.737
It's just your body is going through

29:30.761 --> 29:32.906
all these changes right now,
and I don't know

29:32.930 --> 29:34.776
what's going on inside you,
what you're feeling.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.710
I-I'm trying to be respectful and...

29:36.734 --> 29:38.412
Just shut up, and have sex with me.

29:38.970 --> 29:42.067
You... you mean right now?
Because we could go upstairs

29:42.092 --> 29:43.450
and take my race car bed for a spin.

29:43.474 --> 29:45.085
Definitely not.

29:45.109 --> 29:48.497
I want to finish this
bassinet and then go home.

29:48.842 --> 29:50.390
Great plan. Love that plan.

29:50.415 --> 29:51.615
David...

29:52.740 --> 29:54.239
the bassinet.

29:55.235 --> 29:56.780
Yep, on it.

30:07.475 --> 30:09.264
Hey, you... two.

30:09.289 --> 30:11.311
Z-dawg, this girl is legit.

30:11.336 --> 30:13.217
We gotta get her an internship.

30:13.459 --> 30:15.505
Since when do you know sign language?

30:15.530 --> 30:18.278
Junior year of high school,
Tegan Schloss,

30:18.303 --> 30:20.754
dopest body in the land,
couldn't hear a lick.

30:20.778 --> 30:22.289
I taught myself to sign for her.

30:22.313 --> 30:24.758
Never sealed the deal,
but I did fall in love

30:24.782 --> 30:26.793
with the expressive
physical movements of ASL.

30:26.817 --> 30:29.311
You're a man of constant surprises.

30:30.154 --> 30:32.232
Thank you for inviting me here.

30:32.256 --> 30:34.459
I'm really excited about Sprq Point.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.462
Before we get into work stuff,

30:36.487 --> 30:40.444
we need to talk about your father.

30:41.122 --> 30:43.326
Whoa, you tricked me into coming here

30:43.351 --> 30:44.577
- to talk about my dad?
- Oh.

30:44.602 --> 30:45.746
- Not cool.
- No.

30:45.770 --> 30:48.123
- I added the "not cool" part.
- Right.

30:48.148 --> 30:52.228
Um, it's just that your father
means a lot to our family,

30:52.253 --> 30:56.231
and you seem really upset right now.

30:56.256 --> 30:58.489
Ever since I was little,
he's always tried

30:58.514 --> 31:01.361
to shelter me from the
world and make me better,

31:01.385 --> 31:02.929
whether it was cochlear implants

31:02.953 --> 31:05.032
or hearing aids or speech therapy,

31:05.056 --> 31:09.545
but when nothing fixed me,
he was devastated.

31:10.342 --> 31:12.944
Doesn't that show how
much he cares about you?

31:14.298 --> 31:17.778
Maybe to him, but he always made me feel

31:17.802 --> 31:19.616
like something was wrong with me.

31:19.641 --> 31:21.952
And then I went to
college and met people

31:21.977 --> 31:24.311
who didn't view their
deafness as a weakness.

31:26.069 --> 31:28.967
I now know I can do
anything I want to do.

31:32.059 --> 31:33.459
Like go to Kenya.

31:33.484 --> 31:35.303
Exactly.

31:35.767 --> 31:40.694
I could choose to wallow
or feel bad for myself,

31:40.719 --> 31:43.662
or I could embrace life, take control,

31:43.687 --> 31:45.364
and make my own destiny.

31:45.881 --> 31:49.698
I'm not gonna let him
or anyone else stop me.

31:52.997 --> 31:54.998
I'm not crying. You're crying.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.727
Hey.

31:58.405 --> 32:00.975
When I said I wanted to
discuss the kiss the other day,

32:01.000 --> 32:02.858
I never said how I was feeling,

32:02.883 --> 32:04.264
but...

32:05.141 --> 32:09.057
it's time, and I'm ready.

32:09.201 --> 32:11.920
Okay. I'm listening.

32:12.395 --> 32:16.876
Let me start off by
saying that I refuse,

32:16.901 --> 32:19.748
refuse to be a home wrecker,

32:19.773 --> 32:23.991
and I will never be the other woman.

32:24.648 --> 32:26.116
Nonetheless,

32:26.141 --> 32:29.998
I care about you, Simon, a lot.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.467
We have a chemistry and a
bond that is undeniable,

32:33.492 --> 32:36.506
and I guess I was hoping
that after the kiss,

32:36.531 --> 32:40.144
you'd have some clarity about all of it,

32:40.169 --> 32:45.561
clarity you still don't
have and maybe never will.

32:45.586 --> 32:50.522
So I have to make a change,
instead of just sitting around

32:50.547 --> 32:54.248
and waiting and hoping
for something to happen.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.405
So this is me saying to you...

32:58.311 --> 33:00.061
officially...

33:00.752 --> 33:06.506
I can't and I won't do this anymore.

33:18.818 --> 33:22.225
You did not have to get me those.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.256
I had to do something to thank you

33:24.281 --> 33:28.427
for helping David and I with our issues.

33:28.560 --> 33:32.094
Well, I'm hoping
that means they're resolved.

33:32.119 --> 33:35.753
Well, if I wasn't already
pregnant, I am now.

33:43.577 --> 33:45.558
Maggie, is everything okay?

33:46.676 --> 33:49.155
Yes. I'm sorry.

33:49.180 --> 33:51.128
I'm happy for you, truly.

33:51.153 --> 33:54.099
I just went down
memory lane for a second,

33:54.124 --> 33:57.222
which is never a good idea,
'cause that's not...

33:57.857 --> 33:59.653
where we're at.

34:01.543 --> 34:03.097
Hey, where's Howie?

34:03.122 --> 34:04.784
He's in the kitchen.

34:13.443 --> 34:15.675
- Can we talk?
- Depends.

34:16.103 --> 34:18.603
Are you gonna want half of
this fluffernutter or not?

34:18.629 --> 34:19.940
Oh, I definitely do.

34:19.965 --> 34:22.478
Then I definitely want to talk to you.

34:23.186 --> 34:27.058
So I invited Abigail
to Sprq Point today,

34:27.083 --> 34:29.984
and I think she has a real
chance at interning for us...

34:31.402 --> 34:33.589
after she gets back from Kenya.

34:34.148 --> 34:37.260
I thought I said that was a no-go.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.018
You did, but here's the thing.

34:39.043 --> 34:40.420
I somehow have found myself

34:40.445 --> 34:42.853
becoming more of a
caregiver like you lately,

34:42.879 --> 34:47.572
and it can be challenging
sometimes knowing

34:47.598 --> 34:53.339
the right way and the wrong
way to take care of somebody.

34:53.364 --> 34:56.714
Well, people aren't always
their own best advocates.

34:56.739 --> 34:58.534
But Abigail is.

34:58.784 --> 35:00.370
She knows what she wants.

35:00.395 --> 35:02.339
She's smart, capable.

35:02.364 --> 35:03.631
All due respect,

35:03.656 --> 35:06.768
you have no idea what it's
like to raise a deaf child.

35:06.793 --> 35:09.651
The world is a dangerous place, Zoey.

35:09.676 --> 35:10.902
That's true.

35:11.450 --> 35:15.214
But you also told me
that every day is a gift,

35:15.239 --> 35:18.058
and she's not a little girl anymore,

35:18.083 --> 35:22.118
so don't you think it's time
that she makes her own choices?

35:26.971 --> 35:28.618
Breathes her own breaths?

35:43.567 --> 35:44.766
Hey.

35:45.816 --> 35:47.933
I wanted to tell you something.

35:48.257 --> 35:50.589
I got offered a job on the sixth floor.

35:50.614 --> 35:53.378
- You applied for another job?
- No, no. I was...

35:53.809 --> 35:56.793
recruited, actually, by Ava Price.

35:56.818 --> 35:58.863
She wants me to manage her
whole engineering team.

35:58.888 --> 36:01.910
That's huge, Max. Congratulations.

36:01.935 --> 36:04.947
Thank you.
It's a pretty great opportunity.

36:05.218 --> 36:06.668
You think I should take it?

36:06.693 --> 36:10.738
As your boss, it'll be
very hard to lose you, but...

36:11.925 --> 36:14.692
as your friend, how could
I tell you not to take it?

36:15.502 --> 36:17.324
And what about the Zoey

36:17.349 --> 36:19.503
who sang "I'm Yours" to me?

36:21.857 --> 36:23.957
She's...

36:26.498 --> 36:29.499
gonna miss sitting across
from you every day.

36:31.248 --> 36:35.441
But... she'd never stop you from
going after what you want.

36:38.869 --> 36:40.746
Was that the right answer?

36:43.060 --> 36:44.457
No...

36:45.215 --> 36:46.882
but it just gave me mine.

36:55.715 --> 36:57.510
<i>Take it up, all the way.</i>

36:57.535 --> 36:58.794
- <i>And lift, and lift.</i>
- You know, I think

36:58.818 --> 37:00.616
I do actually feel the
endorphins kicking in.

37:00.641 --> 37:02.853
Uh-huh. So do I,

37:02.878 --> 37:05.556
and I don't think I like it,
but you seem better.

37:05.581 --> 37:06.746
Well, I was hanging out

37:06.771 --> 37:08.223
with this super-cool girl this morning,

37:08.247 --> 37:10.340
and you'd think her life
would be hard 'cause she's deaf,

37:10.364 --> 37:12.019
but she's got it, like, all figured out.

37:12.044 --> 37:15.464
And I'm the one sitting
there all down in the dumps

37:15.489 --> 37:17.464
because I occasionally sing

37:17.489 --> 37:19.855
or hear someone sing out loud?
What's up with that?

37:19.880 --> 37:21.910
Ever heard of the
term "white privilege"?

37:23.142 --> 37:25.287
Anyways, she totally motivated me

37:25.312 --> 37:27.113
to go to Simon and speak my truth,

37:27.138 --> 37:29.533
and I told him I am not

37:29.558 --> 37:32.018
going to get stuck
in this pattern anymore.

37:32.043 --> 37:33.321
And how'd he react to that?

37:33.346 --> 37:34.346
No idea.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.298
But honestly, I'm okay.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.668
I mean, I'm bummed,

37:39.693 --> 37:43.556
but maybe Simon was just a flirtation,

37:43.581 --> 37:46.174
you know, a special moment
in time for both of us.

37:46.199 --> 37:48.077
So does this mean you're not broken?

37:48.102 --> 37:51.205
Well, no, I'm definitely broken,

37:51.597 --> 37:53.954
but at least this is
starting to feel better.

37:53.979 --> 37:55.611
God, I'm tired.

37:56.354 --> 37:57.705
<i>And lift!</i>

37:57.730 --> 37:59.768
_

38:00.408 --> 38:01.409
You know, I always thought

38:01.433 --> 38:02.878
that I would look good
in one of these things,

38:02.902 --> 38:04.002
but I wasn't sure.

38:04.027 --> 38:06.455
I mean, I could... Oh, hey, Zoey.

38:06.480 --> 38:10.096
- What's all this?
- Emily bought us a chairlift.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.885
Now Mitch can move safely up the stairs

38:11.910 --> 38:13.072
without being carried.

38:13.097 --> 38:15.155
And we can sleep in
the same bed together

38:15.180 --> 38:16.323
like we used to.

38:16.347 --> 38:18.260
That is really amazing, Emily.

38:18.285 --> 38:21.133
It's more than amazing.
It's way too much.

38:21.158 --> 38:22.713
Hey, I did not sell my soul

38:22.738 --> 38:24.807
and go into corporate law for nothing.

38:24.832 --> 38:27.510
I did it so I can buy my
family extravagant gifts.

38:27.535 --> 38:29.057
And so that she can lord it over me

38:29.082 --> 38:30.760
that she's the main breadwinner.

38:30.785 --> 38:34.104
This thing is like the
Lamborghini of chairlifts, okay?

38:34.780 --> 38:36.290
In price, not in speed.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.268
I got a few more of these runs left

38:38.293 --> 38:39.832
before I'm outta here.

38:40.285 --> 38:43.893
What's wrong with just
using a regular flashlight?

38:47.045 --> 38:49.084
Yeah, I'm sure it would
be very cool, but...

38:49.109 --> 38:50.273
What's going on in here?

38:50.298 --> 38:52.276
We're just fighting over whether or not

38:52.301 --> 38:55.261
she should bring
infrared goggles to Africa.

38:55.286 --> 38:57.631
So I'm guessing Kenya's back on.

38:57.655 --> 38:58.933
Yes.

38:58.957 --> 39:01.101
I promised I would video chat with him

39:01.126 --> 39:02.711
over a cell phone once a week

39:02.736 --> 39:04.234
if it would make him feel better.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.679
Yeah, for the record,

39:05.704 --> 39:08.718
I told her that we could
do it every other week,

39:08.743 --> 39:11.648
but she could tell I was dying inside.

39:11.867 --> 39:13.445
It's that thrilling, right?

39:13.470 --> 39:14.805
All right. Yeah, right now...

39:14.829 --> 39:16.632
Of course I will miss you,

39:16.657 --> 39:20.257
but not enough to buy
you infrared goggles.
