00:09.444 --> 00:11.098
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:11.141 --> 00:12.534
sexually based offenses

00:12.577 --> 00:14.666
are considered
especially heinous.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.365
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:17.408 --> 00:19.193
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:19.236 --> 00:20.542
are members of an elite squad

00:20.585 --> 00:22.761
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.329
These are their stories.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.691
- Help you with something,
dawg?

00:39.735 --> 00:43.043
- Yeah, I'm here to play.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.353
- One coming up, Los.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.190
- I'm a friend of the house.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.105
- Enjoy your night, sir.

01:11.984 --> 01:15.118
- You must be
the world famous Collum.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.946
Any trouble finding us?

01:16.989 --> 01:19.557
- No, no, I appreciate
you getting back to me.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.343
Corey mentioned you don't
always take referrals.

01:22.386 --> 01:25.128
- He explained our screening
process, right?

01:25.172 --> 01:27.652
It's just for your first time.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.447
- Okay, you're not a cop.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.276
Welcome to the Dollhouse,
Collum.

01:43.625 --> 01:48.282
It's 55 for 15 minutes,
an hour starts at 200.

01:49.109 --> 01:54.288
Tips...are between you
and the girls.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.599
- What about her?

02:01.643 --> 02:05.516
- That's Torie,
excellent choice.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.876
- I said stop it!

02:17.920 --> 02:19.400
That hurts, damn it!

02:19.443 --> 02:20.923
- You get rough with
my girls,

02:20.966 --> 02:22.881
I get rough with your face.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.709
- Stop!

02:26.320 --> 02:28.148
- Go get Carlos.
- Carlos!

02:28.191 --> 02:30.324
Carlos, it's Torie.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.938
- Okay, okay, stand back.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.465
What the...?

02:43.815 --> 02:45.556
- It looks like you cut
yourself, baby.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.818
You want me to help you
with--

02:46.862 --> 02:47.819
- Shut up.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.256
- You shut the hell up.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.218
- Devon, get the hell up here,
now.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.675
- Bitch, you better drop
that pistol.

03:17.719 --> 03:22.158
- Please, I'm sorry, Devon.
I'll be good.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.029
- I'm not asking again.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.989
Put the piece on
the goddamn ground, now.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.301
- 20s, no ID.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.693
At first we thought she was
a jumper,

03:35.737 --> 03:37.434
but it looks like somebody
roughed her up.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.131
- She was sexually assaulted?

03:39.175 --> 03:41.221
- Half undressed,
thumb marks on her biceps,

03:41.264 --> 03:43.527
bruises on her thighs;
I made a judgement call.

03:46.051 --> 03:49.533
- She's got cuts on
her right hand.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.318
Could be defensive wounds.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.102
- We also recovered
a hand gun near the body,

03:53.145 --> 03:54.321
blood on the pistol grip.

03:54.364 --> 03:57.062
- Okay, where did she fall
or jump from?

03:57.106 --> 03:58.455
- The roof of this building.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.718
When we arrived the access
door alarm was going off.

04:00.762 --> 04:03.417
Couple of bloody handprints
up top too.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.896
- Nobody goes in or out.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.594
- My partner's already securing
the building.

04:06.637 --> 04:09.901
- Lieutenant, you're both
gonna wanna see this.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.080
- I get here,
the front door's wide open.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.299
- Anybody home?

04:16.343 --> 04:18.258
- Nope, looks like
whoever lived here

04:18.301 --> 04:19.824
left in a hurry.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.756
- At least we know what
our vic was running from.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.757
- What do you mean?

04:39.801 --> 04:41.803
- First time in a brothel,
fellas?

05:34.725 --> 05:36.292
- So, it looks like
our Jane Doe was

05:36.336 --> 05:37.598
a sex worker.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.774
She may have jumped or fallen
to her death.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.123
- Or got pushed.

05:41.166 --> 05:44.387
Wouldn't be the first hooker
got thrown off a roof.

05:44.431 --> 05:47.259
- Either way, we might be
looking at a sexual assault,

05:47.303 --> 05:48.565
maybe even murder.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.175
- The ME got a hit on
the prints.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.916
The Jane Doe's name is
Torie Meeks.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.135
- So she's in the system?

05:53.178 --> 05:55.311
- Yeah, popped twice for
heroin possession,

05:55.355 --> 05:56.660
once for breaking and entering.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.140
- Heroin, huh?

05:58.183 --> 05:59.533
Fitz said that the victim had
heroin in the tox screen.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.839
- Well, after the B & E,
she qualified for drug court,

06:01.883 --> 06:03.406
she pled guilty,
entered the program.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.756
- Okay, so talk to whoever
handled the case.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.328
- Can someone please explain
why Mr. Perillo is

06:12.372 --> 06:13.808
standing before me again?

06:13.851 --> 06:16.767
- As part of his program,
Mr. Perillo agreed to attend

06:16.811 --> 06:17.942
in-patient rehab.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.770
Last week he violated
this agreement by

06:19.814 --> 06:21.381
staying off-site for
two nights.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.644
- This is exactly why
I recommended against

06:23.687 --> 06:24.906
judicial diversion, Your Honor.

06:24.949 --> 06:27.778
- This infraction aside,
as his case manager,

06:27.822 --> 06:30.302
I can say Mr. Perillo has been
a model participant.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.826
- Thank you Mr. Morris.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.568
If it's all the same, I'd like
to hear from Mr. Perillo.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.396
Why the jailbreak, Jimmy?

06:36.439 --> 06:38.180
- I wanted to see my kid.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.400
I only get visitation
certain days.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.836
- You went to see your son?

06:41.879 --> 06:45.056
- I'm sorry,
I missed my little boy.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.362
- Following any infraction

06:46.406 --> 06:48.059
I'm required to issue
a sanction.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.975
In your case, I'm gonna order
letter writing,

06:51.019 --> 06:53.238
three per week to your son.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.502
I'll review
your visitation schedule.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.808
All right, that's lunch.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.770
- Excuse me...Judge Kofax.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.425
- Detectives.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.253
You tracked me down my one day
a month at drug court.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.559
This must be important.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.431
- We're looking into
the death of a young woman

07:11.474 --> 07:12.562
who went through your program.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.564
- Do you recognize her?

07:14.608 --> 07:17.915
- Oh, my God, Torie Meeks.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.918
Yeah, they told me she was on
the road to recovery.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.051
- So you have no idea when
she relapsed?

07:23.094 --> 07:25.793
- No.
her case manager might.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.534
He was just here,
you can probably catch him

07:27.577 --> 07:28.970
before he leaves the building.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.928
- Thank you.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.191
- I really thought Torie might
turn it around.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.584
- When'd you lose track of her?

07:34.628 --> 07:36.238
- Few months back.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.674
She'd been clean almost
a year.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.371
One day she missed
an appointment,

07:39.415 --> 07:40.590
haven't seen her since.

07:40.634 --> 07:41.765
- Did you try to get in touch?

07:41.809 --> 07:44.202
- Of course.
She went off the grid.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.466
- So, that's it?
You just give up?

07:47.684 --> 07:50.339
- I tried as hard as I could
to save that girl, Detective.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.775
We all did.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.560
- Okay, well, we just need to
notify her next of kin.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.344
- She doesn't have any.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.607
Torie was in foster care
her whole life.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.523
Started drinking at age 12
after being sexually abused

08:00.567 --> 08:01.742
in one of the homes.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.134
On the streets at 16.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.528
- So, this was inevitable?
That's what you're saying.

08:05.572 --> 08:09.053
- I'm saying you can't save
them all.

08:11.099 --> 08:14.494
- Torie did what addicts in
recovery do, she relapsed.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.539
- Okay, can we track down
who ran the brothel?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.280
- I talked to
the building owner,

08:18.323 --> 08:19.586
dude's a slumlord.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.588
Only thing he remembers
about the tenants

08:21.631 --> 08:24.329
is they offered to pay twice
his asking fee.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.592
- A what about the gun,

08:25.635 --> 08:26.723
the gun that was found near
Torie's body?

08:26.767 --> 08:27.855
- We're still waiting for
ballistics.

08:27.898 --> 08:28.899
There's no usable DNA
at the scene,

08:28.943 --> 08:30.814
no prints,
nothing on the cameras.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.991
- I gotta ask, are we wasting
our time here?

08:34.035 --> 08:37.081
I mean, she is a junkie
who relapsed,

08:37.125 --> 08:38.126
she started turning tricks.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.519
She's on the run, high,

08:39.562 --> 08:40.998
she might have just jumped off
that roof.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.740
- And whether she was jumped
or she was pushed,

08:43.784 --> 08:45.655
that girl was brutalized.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.831
And they just up and left
in the middle of the night?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.529
- Well, they know how to
get away.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.967
Only thing they left was
a magazine, some junk,

08:53.010 --> 08:55.056
some random shoe.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.321
- Wait, hold on.
Let me see that for a second.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.542
This is not just
some random shoe,

09:02.585 --> 09:04.587
It's $2,500 Paretto.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.415
I've dreamed of owning
a pair of these for years.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.938
They're custom-made.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.245
- Meaning the store might have
a record of who bought them.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.686
- Look at this craftsmanship,
the stitching, the leather.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.383
- Mm-hmm.
- Of course it's mine.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.211
- So, you can tell us
who bought 'em?

09:20.255 --> 09:21.735
- Not on your life.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.693
- People pay thousands
for these,

09:23.737 --> 09:25.260
you're telling me you don't
keep records?

09:25.303 --> 09:26.609
- Of course I keep records.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.393
They pay thousands
because they expect privacy.

09:28.437 --> 09:31.309
- The person that bought that
shoe may have killed a woman.

09:31.353 --> 09:35.444
I don't know anything about
cobbler-client confidentiality.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.624
- That's your filing system?

09:41.668 --> 09:44.975
- I do better with a lathe
than a laptop.

09:45.019 --> 09:49.110
Five eyelet, cap toe oxford,
size 12?

09:49.153 --> 09:50.198
- Yeah, that's right.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.895
- Couldn't made more
than 50, 60 pair.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.158
- That's a start, I think.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.987
- I have been making bespoke
footwear for half a century.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.903
The key, hand sculpting
a wooden last for

09:59.947 --> 10:01.992
each and every customer's foot.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.081
- That's how they get
such a perfect fit.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.084
- So, he finds the last
and we find our prince?

10:07.128 --> 10:08.390
- Exactly.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.702
If the shoe fits.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.922
- Fine, that's my shoe,
what do you want?

10:18.966 --> 10:20.358
- Well, we just got
a couple of questions

10:20.402 --> 10:21.490
for you, Mr. O'Connor.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.797
- I can explain.
- Explain this.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.583
Torie, she's dead?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.976
Oh, my God, they killed her.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.282
- Time to take a ride,
Cinderella.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.161
- You're telling me that
Torie tied you up,

10:40.204 --> 10:42.380
she gagged you, and then
knocked out her own security

10:42.424 --> 10:43.512
to steal his gun?

10:43.555 --> 10:45.688
- I thought it was a game
at first.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.778
Kinky.
I know it sounds crazy.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.171
- Yeah, it does.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.652
- She kept saying,
"I'll do it, I'll go to jail.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.044
It's better than this."

10:54.088 --> 10:55.785
- Then what happened?
- She ran out of the room.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.787
I heard yelling,
they were pissed.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.833
- Who's "they"?
- I didn't get names.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.922
A Hispanic guy, he had a beard;

11:01.965 --> 11:04.315
A black guy, the bouncer,
and a woman.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.709
One of them must have
thrown her off that roof.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.450
- Okay, and you're telling me

11:08.493 --> 11:10.713
that you had nothing to do
with it?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.323
- I was tied up.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.717
Next thing I know,
it's full panic.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.110
One of the girls untied me.

11:16.153 --> 11:19.504
Everybody was rushing out,
I left quick as I could.

11:19.548 --> 11:22.986
I have never paid for
a prostitute before in my life.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.423
- So, this is the story
you're going with?

11:25.467 --> 11:27.817
- I take the 4 train from
the Upper East Side

11:27.861 --> 11:28.992
to Wall Street every day.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.560
I work 12 hours,
then it's home for dinner

11:31.603 --> 11:32.822
with the wife and kids.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.607
- Yeah?
- I needed a little spice.

11:35.651 --> 11:38.610
- Yeah, killing hookers,
that's pretty spicy.

11:38.654 --> 11:41.091
- I didn't kill anyone.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.398
I swear to God.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.705
- How did you find out
about this brothel?

11:47.445 --> 11:50.710
One night, it's snowing,
subways delayed, no cabs,

11:50.753 --> 11:52.233
so I hit the bar.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.452
I end up being a little
too honest about

11:54.496 --> 11:56.628
the home front with the guy
sitting next to me.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.152
He gave me a number,

11:58.195 --> 12:01.198
said the place was called
The Dollhouse.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.724
Honest, that's all I know.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.165
Can I go?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.036
- Oh, sure.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.169
Maybe we'll have your wife
pick you up?

12:17.911 --> 12:19.782
- So, we actually believe
this guy?

12:19.826 --> 12:22.393
- That he's a bored husband
that goes to hookers?

12:22.437 --> 12:23.830
Yeah.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.222
- All right, well, TARU ran
the number that he called.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.007
Surprise, it's a burner.

12:27.050 --> 12:30.140
- So, Torie said that
she'd rather go to jail?

12:30.184 --> 12:33.491
She attacked her pimp,
she tried to escape.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.580
We might be looking at
trafficking.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.582
- Maybe 'Dollhouse' is in
the database.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.062
- No, we can go straight to
the source.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.630
I got a friend in Vice that
may be able to help.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.240
- Check it out.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.245
- Yeah, it's like playing
whack-a-mole these days.

12:48.289 --> 12:51.248
The internet moved traditional
street trade indoors,

12:51.292 --> 12:53.381
so now we just target
the more obvious fronts.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.904
- The Thai rub-tug joints?

12:54.948 --> 12:57.211
- Something you wanna confess,
Sergeant?

12:57.254 --> 12:58.778
- You two go way back, huh?

12:58.821 --> 13:00.301
- Yep, to Fin's Narco days,

13:00.344 --> 13:01.911
back when he used to have to
work for a living.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.609
- Baker's been busting my balls
for over 20 years.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.786
- So, what did your John call
this place?

13:06.829 --> 13:08.570
- The Dollhouse.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.441
- These operations are getting
wise.

13:10.485 --> 13:13.096
The "pop-up" brothels
are the new frontier.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.228
- Yeah, they open for
a few days,

13:14.271 --> 13:15.229
maybe a week, right?

13:15.272 --> 13:16.621
Constantly changing locations.

13:16.665 --> 13:17.884
- Exactly.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.363
And when the Feds,
in their infinite wisdom,

13:19.407 --> 13:21.452
decided to shut down Backpage,

13:21.496 --> 13:23.280
they became even tougher
to track.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.152
- Well, so, they should have
kept the site open?

13:25.195 --> 13:27.850
I mean, it facilitates
prostitution,

13:27.894 --> 13:29.373
money laundering,
sex trafficking.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.027
- Well, it's called
the oldest profession

13:31.071 --> 13:32.986
for a reason,
they went online.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.378
Now you just gotta know where
to look,

13:34.422 --> 13:36.816
and lucky for you two, I do.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.692
- Ooh, blow that up.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.218
That's Torie.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.177
- They could have changed
the ad.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.222
- All right, I say we do
a sting.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.484
We can use my team.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.877
- We need to get a warrant
ASAP.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.618
- I think I know just the guy.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.579
- Oh, Detectives,
thank you for coming.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.408
So you sure these are the guys
that had Torie?

14:04.452 --> 14:05.888
- Yes, we're pretty sure,
Your Honor.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.412
Sergeant Tutuola made contact
via text posing as a John.

14:08.456 --> 14:09.892
It's the exact same MO.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.589
- Judge Barth, Judge Kofax,

14:11.633 --> 14:13.722
I know you know Sergeant Baker
from Vice, right?

14:13.765 --> 14:14.679
- It's nice to see you two,

14:14.723 --> 14:16.116
sorry to interrupt
your evening.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.334
- Ah, just two colleagues
grabbing

14:17.378 --> 14:19.771
an after work cocktail,
Sergeant.

14:22.339 --> 14:26.430
- Do me a favor,
nail these bastards.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.389
- It's what we do best.

14:29.390 --> 14:33.350
It reminds me of us with
our "after work drinks."

14:33.394 --> 14:35.439
We got a no-knock warrant on
a brothel

14:35.483 --> 14:37.311
that is open for business.

14:37.354 --> 14:41.010
So, shock-and-awe, boys,
no bullets if possible.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.969
- The apartment we're hitting
is 4E.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.492
There's most likely
muscle inside.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.580
- And they're definitely
strapped,

14:45.623 --> 14:47.103
so keep your heads on a swivel.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.149
- Super unlocked the back door.
- We're good to proceed?

14:49.192 --> 14:50.846
- Let's go ruin their night.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.674
- On me, fast and light.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.052
- Now.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.054
- Go, go, go!
- Police!

15:25.098 --> 15:26.577
Open the door!

15:27.448 --> 15:29.929
- Freeze! Freeze!

15:29.972 --> 15:31.452
- What the hell?

15:33.149 --> 15:35.369
- Clear.
- Nothing.

15:35.412 --> 15:36.979
- Nobody's home.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.242
- We're clear, Detectives.
- What's this look like to you?

15:39.286 --> 15:41.288
- They knew we were coming.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.683
- I think we got a mole,
Lieutenant.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.424
- Yeah, I'd watch who
you blame, Detective.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.948
Your squad knew about this
raid, too.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.166
- Excuse me?
- Hey.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.602
How 'bout we don't jump
to conclusions?

15:51.646 --> 15:54.257
- The operation was run through
your squad, Phoebe.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.780
- You came to me.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.566
I mean, maybe they made you for
a cop off your text.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.960
How are those U-C skills
working for you these days?

16:01.003 --> 16:02.962
- Everybody calm down.
- No, no, you know what?

16:03.005 --> 16:05.486
You calm down.
Cops don't railroad other cops.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.009
- Up goes the blue wall
of silence?

16:07.053 --> 16:09.925
- Hey, guys, stop, both of you.
Listen to me.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.405
There are two possibilities.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.841
Either they knew that we were
coming

16:12.884 --> 16:16.671
or they got a bad feeling
and they changed things up

16:16.714 --> 16:18.194
just to be safe.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.196
But either way, we turned
their door into to splinters,

16:20.240 --> 16:23.069
so...so they're on to us now.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.374
- So now they go to ground.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.680
- That was Ballistics.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.421
The gun we found next to
Torie's body belonged to

16:27.464 --> 16:29.466
a heroin dealer who was killed
in a drug bust.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.686
- Salt meet wound.
- No, you don't get it.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.949
That gun was bagged and tagged
evidence.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.081
It's supposed to be sitting at

16:35.124 --> 16:36.865
a property clerk's
office right now.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.390
- So the only one who had
access to it would have been...

16:40.434 --> 16:42.349
- Would be a cop.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.230
- You kidding?

16:54.274 --> 16:55.231
Two years from my pension,

16:55.275 --> 16:57.233
No way I misplace evidence.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.061
- Well, maybe not, but I got
a ballistics report here

16:59.105 --> 17:01.846
that says a gun that was found
next to dead girl's body

17:01.890 --> 17:03.718
is the same gun that's
supposedly bagged and tagged

17:03.761 --> 17:05.111
in your warehouse.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.503
- I don't know much about
physics, but I do know

17:06.547 --> 17:08.114
the same gun can't be in
two places at the same time.

17:08.157 --> 17:11.421
- So Ballistics screwed up,
transposed the serial number.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.032
- That's what I'm thinking.

17:14.511 --> 17:17.688
- Invoice number 218-23,

17:17.732 --> 17:21.083
one Walther 9-milimeter pistol.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.999
In a box on the shelf
in the back.

17:26.001 --> 17:29.265
- Okay, so you're right,
but can you humor us?

17:29.309 --> 17:31.050
We just gotta make sure.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.707
- Let's hope Ballistics did
make that mistake.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.231
- For Fin's sake.

17:41.190 --> 17:45.107
- Present and accounted for,
like I said.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.590
Damn.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.116
- A brick in the evidence bag?

17:54.160 --> 17:57.685
- Someone either broke into
the Property Clerk's Office...

17:57.728 --> 18:00.383
- Or checked in a brick in
the precinct lockup?

18:02.124 --> 18:04.126
You got the letter of
Transmittal?

18:04.170 --> 18:07.999
- The bust was made by
your squad November 12.

18:08.043 --> 18:11.438
- So you're saying it's a cop
from my unit made the switch?

18:12.874 --> 18:14.702
- It's your move, Baker.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.966
- All right, give me a second.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.333
Hey, Gujjar.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.074
DA's office says evidence from

18:39.118 --> 18:41.032
a case I was working
got mislabeled.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.818
So, take a look and tell me
what other idiots

18:43.861 --> 18:46.212
went into lockup that day,
November 12.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.039
- November 12.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.394
Bromland, Fisher, and Ramirez.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.225
- The MENSA society of
midtown Manhattan.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.183
Thank you.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.533
All right, three detectives
signed in to lockup,

19:03.577 --> 19:05.666
but, Fin, they're all
good cops.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.363
- One of 'em isn't.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.715
- All right, just give me
a second here, okay?

19:11.759 --> 19:13.630
- I gotta report to
my Lieutenant.

19:13.674 --> 19:16.024
- I get it, we all have bosses.

19:16.067 --> 19:20.420
Just...just hold off on
calling IAB.

19:25.251 --> 19:28.123
- Fin, we have to let IAB
handle it.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.429
- Not yet.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.651
- You think Phoebe Baker
is involved?

19:34.695 --> 19:36.523
- No, but it's her people,

19:36.566 --> 19:38.089
and she wants to clean
her own house.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.004
We have history,
I owe her that.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.093
- As long as we stay on top
of it.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.400
I want surveillance on
all three cops

19:54.628 --> 19:55.803
- I don't like this.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.457
Ramirez has been in there
over 40 minutes.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.068
- Yeah, nothing illegal so far.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.330
- It's a sketchy neighborhood.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.853
- Checked the building out,
it's clean.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.812
Maybe he's got a girlfriend.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.946
- Rollins, anything on
Bromland?

20:08.990 --> 20:10.992
- Yeah, he got in about
an hour ago.

20:11.035 --> 20:13.690
It looks like he and his wife
are having a dinner party.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.257
- All right,
stay on him for now.

20:15.301 --> 20:18.565
We may have a lead on Ramirez.
I'll check back.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.828
- I forgot how boring
stakeouts are.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.918
- I'm sorry to ruin
your evening.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.963
- You know, maybe these cops
were set up.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.051
Right?

20:27.095 --> 20:28.879
There's a lot easier ways to
get a gun

20:28.923 --> 20:31.578
than to steal it from
an evidence room, you know?

20:32.666 --> 20:33.797
- What the--

20:33.841 --> 20:36.365
Hey, maybe not so boring.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.932
- I trailed Fisher.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.586
He went from his place
to the precinct,

20:39.629 --> 20:40.935
and he's on night shift,

20:40.978 --> 20:42.806
there is no way he's doing
dirty on the clock.

20:42.850 --> 20:43.938
- Well, Bromland's home,

20:43.981 --> 20:45.635
so the only one left
is Ramirez.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.246
- He's not doing anything,
I'm telling you.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.596
I know Ramirez,
he's a good cop.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.994
- Yeah, well, maybe
his lady friend

20:57.038 --> 20:58.953
doesn't want him to smoke
inside.

21:05.089 --> 21:08.876
- Hold up.
Something's going down.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.719
- Okay, we found our dirty cop.

21:25.762 --> 21:28.069
- Son of a bitch.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.464
- So, what do you wanna do?

21:33.422 --> 21:36.251
- We get a warrant.
- Kofax knows the case.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.122
- Yeah, I'm parked around
the block.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.515
I'll get it signed,
I'll text you.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.125
- All right.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.956
- I'll call Rollins.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.266
- Yeah, what do you got, Fin?

21:52.876 --> 21:54.748
It's Ramirez.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.359
Lights out in
the Bromland apartment,

21:57.403 --> 21:58.360
he's not going anywhere.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.927
I'm on my way.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.803
- You and Baker,
I'm getting a sense that

22:06.847 --> 22:08.109
there's some history there.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.937
- Yeah, there's some history.

22:12.548 --> 22:13.941
- Come on.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.643
- You know, after my divorce,
she was the first.

22:20.687 --> 22:23.298
She was good to me, you know?

22:23.342 --> 22:27.084
But dealing with my wife
and my kid,

22:27.128 --> 22:29.609
I wasn't ready for
anything serious.

22:29.652 --> 22:30.958
It ended up messy.

22:31.001 --> 22:34.309
- Okay, but that was then,
this is now.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.269
And I mean,
she seems pretty great.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.446
- How long does it take to get
a warrant?

22:43.971 --> 22:46.800
- Come on, girl,
answer the phone, Phoebe.

22:46.843 --> 22:48.802
Pick up.

22:51.544 --> 22:55.025
- All right, hold on.
Something's going on.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.987
- Okay, it's going down.
It's going down.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.423
Move, move, move.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.170
- Freeze, don't move.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.695
- What happened?
- No idea.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.305
- 2C.

23:16.482 --> 23:20.137
- SVU portable, we need backup
at Macombs and West 150.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.228
Go, go, go, go.

23:25.882 --> 23:27.536
- NYPD.

23:34.804 --> 23:35.805
Not again.

23:35.849 --> 23:39.200
- Yeah, there's gotta be
a back exit.

23:42.377 --> 23:43.987
Guys.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.120
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.470
- I she alive?
- Yeah, barely.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.732
She's too high to run.

23:49.776 --> 23:51.647
- Baker's downstairs.
- All right.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.823
SVU portable, we need a bus.

23:53.867 --> 23:56.696
Hey, honey.
Hey, you doing all right?

23:58.828 --> 24:00.134
- What the hell happened?

24:00.177 --> 24:01.831
- You tell us.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.659
- What?
Where is Ramirez?

24:03.703 --> 24:06.009
- Somebody tipped them off,
again.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.011
- Where you been?

24:08.055 --> 24:09.839
- What?
I've been getting a warrant.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.667
- Why didn't you answer
your cell?

24:11.711 --> 24:12.973
- What?

24:13.016 --> 24:14.148
Wait a minute,
you don't think I had

24:14.191 --> 24:15.628
something to do with this?

24:15.671 --> 24:18.500
- You and I need to talk,
that's what I think.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.284
- Really?

24:21.895 --> 24:24.158
Fin.
- Right now.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.039
- Your waitress will be
right with you.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.041
- We need a minute.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.869
- I'll have a coffee.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.047
- Are you telling me the truth,
Baker?

24:45.571 --> 24:47.486
- First of all, yes.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.837
Second of all,
you used to call me Phoebe.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.403
- You think this is funny?

24:52.447 --> 24:53.970
- Hilarious, yeah.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.799
What I think is that
you're out of your mind

24:56.843 --> 24:59.454
for thinking that I had
anything to do with this.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.370
- Ramirez was tipped off.
- Not by me.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.589
- Why didn't you answer
your cell phone?

25:03.632 --> 25:07.070
- I was with Kofax
in the back of Maxwell's

25:07.114 --> 25:09.333
where I don't have
cell service.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.860
You know what?
Screw you.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.211
You know me.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.126
- I used to.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.652
One of the girls was
left behind,

25:23.696 --> 25:25.741
blonde in her 20s, on the nod.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.743
- I don't know anything about
any girls.

25:27.787 --> 25:30.616
- That's good,
'cause when she comes to,

25:30.659 --> 25:32.661
we're gonna show her
your picture.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.359
- You do that, you do that.

25:35.403 --> 25:38.928
And then go screw yourself,
again.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.542
- Ramirez is our dirty cop?

25:43.585 --> 25:45.761
- Maybe not the only one.
- Not sure yet.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.850
- Phoebe Baker may be our mole.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.548
- That's not what you said
yesterday.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.289
- Well, I hope I'm wrong.
She denies it.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.422
- You talked to her, alone?

25:54.465 --> 25:57.425
Without IAB, without backup.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.774
- I know what I'm doing, Liv.

25:58.818 --> 26:02.299
- So, listen, Anne Kuzmin
is--she was left behind,

26:02.343 --> 26:03.866
one of the girls.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.956
She's 25, she's got a record
of solicitation, possession.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.437
- We need to see if she can
ID Baker.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.656
- And if she can?

26:10.699 --> 26:13.354
- I'll make the call
to IAB myself.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.018
- Am I under arrest?

26:25.061 --> 26:27.324
- No, but you need to answer
some questions.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.677
I--I really need...
- A fix, yeah, we know.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.983
But first,
you're gonna have to help us.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.332
Okay?

26:35.376 --> 26:37.030
You recognize any of
these guys?

26:38.379 --> 26:40.033
You can go this way.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.559
- I can't--I can't--I can't.
I can't.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.169
- Anne, listen to me.
Listen to me.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.563
We can help you
and we can protect you,

26:48.607 --> 26:51.784
but you need to tell us
what you know.

26:51.827 --> 26:54.438
- Okay, do you know his name?

26:55.701 --> 26:58.617
Um, he makes us call him Papi,

26:58.660 --> 27:01.402
but I think his real name is
Carlos.

27:01.445 --> 27:02.621
- And what does Carlos do?

27:02.664 --> 27:04.971
- He runs Dollhouse,
he gets us drugs.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.668
I just--I just do what
he says, you know?

27:06.712 --> 27:07.974
He has a gun.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.324
- How did you get here?
Where are you from?

27:10.367 --> 27:12.674
- Lowell, Massachusetts.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.676
I ran away to New York
when I was 15.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.330
- And when did you meet Carlos?

27:16.373 --> 27:18.245
- Uh, a year ago.

27:18.288 --> 27:20.726
I was on the streets
and after I got busted,

27:20.769 --> 27:22.205
I tried to get clean, you know?

27:22.249 --> 27:24.773
I went to NA and this woman
approached me

27:24.817 --> 27:27.471
and said she was a cop
in recovery.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.650
- What was her name?

27:31.693 --> 27:33.782
- Her nickname was Fee.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.610
She introduced me to Carlos.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.221
At first, it wasn't that bad,
you know?

27:38.265 --> 27:42.661
Middle-aged married men,
so the sex was over quick,

27:42.704 --> 27:44.575
all the drugs you wanted.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.142
- But then?

27:46.186 --> 27:50.843
- When you needed another fix,
they make you work for it.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.715
And if you didn't want to,
they would threaten to call

27:53.759 --> 27:56.283
the cops on you, bust you
for parole violation.

27:58.502 --> 27:59.721
One of the girls,
a few nights ago,

27:59.765 --> 28:01.810
she tried to get away,

28:01.854 --> 28:04.247
and they pushed her off a roof.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.293
They said that they would do
the same to us

28:06.336 --> 28:07.816
if we tried to run.

28:07.860 --> 28:10.340
- Okay, is that her?

28:10.384 --> 28:13.300
- Yeah, that's Torie.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.432
I guess she had enough.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.783
She just grabbed Carlos's gun.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.047
She's better off now.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.919
- Okay, the woman from NA,

28:23.963 --> 28:26.922
the one that said
she was a cop,

28:26.966 --> 28:29.751
Do you, uh, you see her here?

28:31.884 --> 28:34.930
No, I--no, I've never seen
any of them before.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.414
- What about her?

28:41.676 --> 28:44.461
- No.
- Are you sure?

28:44.505 --> 28:47.421
- I'm sure, it's not Fee.

28:58.693 --> 29:01.130
- It wasn't Baker?

29:01.174 --> 29:03.916
- She didn't ID her,
but we could be looking at

29:03.959 --> 29:05.961
another female cop.

29:06.005 --> 29:08.224
Who were the officers on
Anne's last arrest?

29:08.268 --> 29:10.226
- Darla Davis
and Mack O'Bannon.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.359
They're patrol officers on
the 21st.

29:12.402 --> 29:15.057
- I'll find out if there's any
connection to Ramirez or Vice.

29:15.101 --> 29:16.580
- We know that Ramirez is
involved,

29:16.624 --> 29:18.147
so he's our ground zero.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.497
Are you on speaking terms
with Baker?

29:20.541 --> 29:22.456
- Not yet.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.414
- Time to apologize.

29:28.027 --> 29:31.334
- So, now you want my help,
huh?

29:31.378 --> 29:33.162
- We need your help.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.685
- Really?

29:34.729 --> 29:37.688
And why should I trust
either of you?

29:37.732 --> 29:39.212
Huh, Fin?

29:39.255 --> 29:40.822
Really,
thinking that I'm dirty?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.650
- Phoebe, it looked bad.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.263
Because of our history, I held
you to a higher standard.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.962
I should have known that's not
who you are.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.616
I apologize, I'm sorry.

29:55.184 --> 29:58.057
But now we gotta go nail
these bastards.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.937
- So, Stone's going hard ass
on this traffic girl

30:08.981 --> 30:10.156
from Sugar Hill?

30:10.199 --> 30:11.461
- Yeah, my Lieutenant's pissed
about it, too.

30:11.505 --> 30:12.767
I mean, this girl's a victim,
but she's carrying

30:12.811 --> 30:14.073
eight ounces of heroin.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.596
That's an A-1 felony.
- Stone offering a deal?

30:15.639 --> 30:18.381
- Name names, drivers,
whoever's running the ring,

30:18.425 --> 30:19.600
anybody she knows.

30:19.643 --> 30:20.949
- She gonna take it?

30:20.993 --> 30:22.255
- She's at Rikers right now
thinking about it.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.560
Just wanted to give you
the heads up, okay?

30:23.604 --> 30:25.084
- Yeah, thank you.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.522
Hey, Ramirez,
is this crap coffee maker

30:28.565 --> 30:30.567
giving anything worth having?

30:30.611 --> 30:32.091
- What do you think?
- No.

30:32.134 --> 30:34.441
I got some French roast
from home back at my desk.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.746
You want some?

30:35.790 --> 30:37.357
- I think I'm gonna make
a Joe's run.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.925
You want anything?
- No, I'm good.

31:11.695 --> 31:14.002
- Where's he going?

31:14.046 --> 31:16.483
- To meet his handler.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.579
Who the hell is that?

31:29.626 --> 31:31.628
- Son of a bitch.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.979
That's Judge Kofax.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.685
- Guys, I've never heard
even a hint of

31:44.728 --> 31:46.992
any impropriety about
Judge Kofax.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.471
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

31:48.515 --> 31:51.170
Look, the last time Anne Kuzmin
was arrested,

31:51.213 --> 31:52.954
she avoided jail time by
enrolling in

31:52.998 --> 31:54.260
a drug treatment court.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.610
Now, the supervising judge
was Edward Kofax.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.351
The same thing for Torie Meeks.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.961
- We found four other women,

32:00.005 --> 32:05.227
all enrolled in drug court,
all supervised by Judge Kofax.

32:05.271 --> 32:08.100
- Vice asked for warrants
on over 100 pop-up brothels

32:08.143 --> 32:09.275
in the past year.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.190
14 of the raids
were tipped off.

32:11.233 --> 32:14.062
On all of them, the warrants
were signed by Kofax.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.977
- Yeah, when we fed Ramirez
that fake info,

32:16.021 --> 32:17.370
he went straight to him.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.720
- Well, they're both gonna deny
any connection.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.548
They're just gonna claim
that it was a coincidence.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.854
Look, I know that this all
sounds bad,

32:23.898 --> 32:25.769
but it's all circumstantial.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.991
- So, what now?

32:33.125 --> 32:35.431
If we're gonna go after
a sitting judge,

32:35.475 --> 32:37.868
we can't afford to miss.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.747
- Anne Kuzmin, again.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.576
Her third arrest for possession
this year.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.056
- She can still be saved.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.448
- You've given her a chance.

32:52.492 --> 32:55.582
ROR, drug treatment court,
it's not working.

32:55.625 --> 32:59.238
- And I am asking you
for one last chance.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.283
- You know I can't do that.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.417
- Her arraignment is today.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.769
You know, it's not gonna do
this girl any good

33:08.812 --> 33:10.640
to be behind bars.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.949
I wouldn't ask you this, Elana,

33:14.993 --> 33:17.734
if I didn't believe this was
the right thing to do.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.086
Hmm?

33:21.129 --> 33:23.523
- I can never say no to you,
Edward.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.927
- Judge Kofax.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.364
- Yes, can I help you?

33:38.407 --> 33:40.279
- You may wanna come with us.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.107
- What the hell is this?

33:42.150 --> 33:44.631
I wouldn't ask you this,
Elana,

33:44.674 --> 33:47.199
if I didn't believe this was
the right thing to do.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.983
What you're thinking,
you're wrong.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.289
- No, they're not.

33:50.332 --> 33:51.812
- Elana?

33:51.855 --> 33:54.293
- Whatever else you need,
let me know.

33:54.336 --> 33:55.685
- Let's go.

34:15.966 --> 34:18.230
- You got no evidence
against me.

34:18.273 --> 34:19.709
- Oh, well, trust me, Kofax,
we got plenty,

34:19.753 --> 34:21.363
otherwise you wouldn't be
sitting over there.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.887
- Detective Carlos Ramirez,

34:23.931 --> 34:27.587
Officer Felicia Taggart,
and Devon Jones

34:27.630 --> 34:29.589
are all being arraigned
as we speak.

34:29.632 --> 34:31.852
- Yeah, they all told IAB that
you were the mastermind of

34:31.895 --> 34:32.896
the whole operation.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.028
- That's ridiculous.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.595
- Every detail,
how you hand-picked

34:35.638 --> 34:37.510
vulnerable girls
and then you got the cops

34:37.553 --> 34:38.728
to do your dirty work.

34:38.772 --> 34:41.166
- Testimony of co-conspirators.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.602
They don't know the real story.

34:42.645 --> 34:45.039
- Well, Judge Barth is
cooperating,

34:45.083 --> 34:46.606
and, by the way,
so is your wife.

34:46.649 --> 34:49.043
- My wife doesn't know
anything.

34:49.087 --> 34:53.743
- We're gonna find the money.
Kofax, it's over.

34:53.787 --> 34:56.006
- Maybe it's time we called in
the ADA.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.834
- All right, be quiet, Diane.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.924
There is no money,
I didn't take a dime.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.317
I was helping those girls.

35:02.361 --> 35:03.536
- By trafficking them?

35:03.579 --> 35:05.494
By using their addiction
as a weapon?

35:05.538 --> 35:07.322
- They wanted a fix.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.063
I just gave them what
they wanted.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.282
I took care of them.

35:10.325 --> 35:11.805
- You took care of them?

35:13.154 --> 35:17.158
Tori Meeks, 22 years old, dead.

35:17.202 --> 35:20.335
Anne Kuzmin, 25 years old,

35:20.379 --> 35:21.771
survived by the skin of
her teeth.

35:21.815 --> 35:24.209
And four others under
your care,

35:24.252 --> 35:27.125
under your protection,
in your courtroom.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.083
- And I protected all of them.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.346
- You protected them, how?

35:31.390 --> 35:33.479
- Like they were
my own daughters.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.918
Lisa White, Farrah Bashir,

35:37.961 --> 35:41.965
Britt Baker,
Anya Pliskova--she 18.

35:43.793 --> 35:46.666
They were all dead already.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.190
- What are you talking about?

35:49.234 --> 35:50.887
- Their souls were dead

35:50.931 --> 35:52.585
the minute they walked into
my courtroom.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.762
Junkies, addicts, thieves
stealing their own lives,

35:55.805 --> 35:58.417
their own futures from
their parents,

35:58.460 --> 36:01.115
who loved them,
who were helpless.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.769
I kept their daughters safe.

36:02.812 --> 36:05.337
I made sure they only had
good, clean doses,

36:05.380 --> 36:07.426
no ODs, kept them alive.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.297
- That's enough, Edward.
- It is not enough!

36:09.341 --> 36:10.646
It's never enough.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.127
They're dead inside.
Their eyes are dead.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.694
But if they're still breathing,

36:14.737 --> 36:16.217
if their hearts were still
beating,

36:16.261 --> 36:17.958
then there was a chance.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.656
If I'd given Delia that chance,
maybe...

36:27.185 --> 36:28.795
- Delia?

36:32.581 --> 36:36.542
- She was 16 when
she overdosed.

36:39.893 --> 36:43.418
It did not have to end
that way.

36:43.462 --> 36:46.595
Her body in the ground...

36:48.423 --> 36:51.165
Cold, alone...

36:53.167 --> 36:54.864
my little girl.

37:08.878 --> 37:13.100
- Liv says Kofax took a deal.
He'll do 25 years.

37:13.143 --> 37:14.667
- His age, that's life.

37:14.710 --> 37:17.322
- You know, what he did,
he deserves it,

37:17.365 --> 37:18.888
daughter or no daughter.

37:18.932 --> 37:21.369
- Speaking of, I've gotta get
the sitter off the clock.

37:21.413 --> 37:24.067
I think it's gonna be
pizza night again

37:24.111 --> 37:25.199
at the Rollins household.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.592
- Nothing wrong with pizza.
- Yeah?

37:26.635 --> 37:28.289
Jesse and Billie would love to
see you,

37:28.333 --> 37:29.682
if you don't have other plans.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.510
- Later, I do, but first,
I can come by, say hello.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.033
- Great.
You too, Fin.

37:33.076 --> 37:35.296
- I'm meeting somebody,
but thanks.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.096
- Hey.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.448
- I'm starting my program
again.

37:56.491 --> 37:57.797
Trying to.

37:57.840 --> 38:01.148
- I'm really proud of you.

38:01.191 --> 38:04.064
- Well, the other girls
are back in recovery, too.

38:04.107 --> 38:05.239
- Good.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.850
- We all went to
Torie's funeral.

38:07.894 --> 38:09.983
One of her foster brothers
was there,

38:10.026 --> 38:13.769
said he's fighting to clear
her name for the drug charges.

38:13.813 --> 38:17.164
- Well, I can help with that.

38:17.207 --> 38:18.600
- Thank you.

38:19.949 --> 38:22.561
Thanks for checking up on me.
- Yeah.

38:22.604 --> 38:27.609
Anne, you're gonna get
through this.

38:30.830 --> 38:34.224
I'm so sorry for everything
that's happened to you.

38:37.967 --> 38:42.929
And the system is...far from
perfect,

38:42.972 --> 38:46.715
but it can work.

38:48.238 --> 38:51.024
You can make...

38:51.067 --> 38:55.071
whatever life for yourself
that you want.

38:56.682 --> 38:59.424
- Do you really believe that?

38:59.467 --> 39:02.862
- Yes, I do.

39:07.214 --> 39:08.955
- Thank you.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.447
- Thank you.

39:22.490 --> 39:25.624
Well, to teamwork.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.190
- To teamwork.

39:30.237 --> 39:31.760
Gonna be okay?

39:32.848 --> 39:37.766
- I mean, seeing Ramirez
go down was like a gut punch,

39:37.810 --> 39:42.205
and I have a lot of explaining
to do to my captain, but yeah.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.643
- I'm sorry about how
I treated you, Phoebe.

39:44.686 --> 39:45.992
- You apologized.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.386
- I mean how I treated you
20 years ago.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.912
- Oh, that.
- Yeah.

39:52.955 --> 39:55.175
I was getting over my marriage,

39:55.218 --> 39:58.744
it wasn't fair it became
your problem.

39:58.787 --> 40:00.659
- Water under the bridge.

40:00.702 --> 40:03.401
- I'm not that same guy
anymore.

40:04.358 --> 40:05.794
- Good.

40:07.361 --> 40:10.408
I'm not that same girl, either.

40:11.539 --> 40:12.671
- I know.

40:12.714 --> 40:16.501
So, I was thinking,
if you're into it,

40:16.544 --> 40:18.720
maybe we could try again.

40:22.898 --> 40:25.858
- Fin, I'm flattered, um...

40:25.901 --> 40:27.729
but I'm seeing someone now.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.339
- Oh, wow, I'm sorry.

40:29.383 --> 40:30.471
- No, it's--it's, um,

40:30.515 --> 40:31.516
I don't know if he's the one
or anything,

40:31.559 --> 40:34.214
but we're good together, so...

40:34.257 --> 40:36.521
I actually am supposed to go
meet him now.

40:36.564 --> 40:37.652
You wanna come?

40:37.696 --> 40:39.480
- Oh, no, no come on.
- That's stupid.

40:39.524 --> 40:43.005
Okay, um...

40:45.573 --> 40:47.357
It was good to see you.

40:47.401 --> 40:48.881
- You too.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.058
- Take care, Fin.
