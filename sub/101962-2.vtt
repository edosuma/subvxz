WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:04.160
Where better to hide from us
than in the past?

00:04.320 --> 00:07.640
It'd be better to look
for the <i>Book of Life.</i>

00:07.800 --> 00:11.760
Firstly, Diana is in need of a teacher.
A witch.

00:11.920 --> 00:15.000
<i>Between us we can</i>
<i>find someone discreet.</i>

00:15.160 --> 00:16.920
Sophie?

00:18.800 --> 00:21.200
You can keep your money.
I will have no part of this.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.920
And the other matter?

00:23.080 --> 00:25.320
We need to locate a lost book.
An alchemical manuscript.

00:25.480 --> 00:28.280
It has details of the origins
of the three creatures.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.640
-If it exists.
-It exists.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.760
I can't believe Christopher
Marlowe is a demon.

00:32.920 --> 00:35.680
A witch. If you spoke civilly to one,
I'd be concerned. But, married?

00:35.840 --> 00:37.240
You must see,
I need your help.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.080
It's power like yours, that's why
they're hunting us in Scotland.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.000
It's why even here we have no peace
from men like your husband.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.280
My father needed a spy
in the English court.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.280
I fulfilled that need
and I did it very well.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.800
Who do you answer to?
William Cecil?

00:49.960 --> 00:51.280
<i>Lord Burghley, yes.</i>

00:51.440 --> 00:55.320
We shall see how this chaos
of yours plays out.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.320
<i>Your methods of persuasion</i>
<i>have been sorely missed.</i>

00:58.480 --> 01:02.160
<i>Being back here,</i>
<i>wearing the cloak of his old self...</i>

01:02.320 --> 01:07.240
Changed. Do not, for one moment,
assume you know him.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.520
<i>Knox will find us here.</i>
<i>I can feel it.</i>

01:16.680 --> 01:20.320
I knew the coven will
not tell Knox anything.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.520
Mary Johnson always hated me.
I bet she snitched right away.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.840
None of them even know
where Diana and Matthew have gone.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.720
Yeah, and they could be
dead for all we know.

01:32.880 --> 01:37.480
This page is connected to Diana.
It must have answers for us.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.440
That book started
this whole nightmare.

01:41.960 --> 01:44.240
Don't you want to know why?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.400
They're dining with us tonight?

01:49.560 --> 01:52.400
You can't avoid
each other forever.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.840
I believe we all prefer it that way.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.240
I'm tolerating him under my roof
and affording him my protection.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.080
We don't need to play happy families.

02:04.160 --> 02:08.080
Matthew would want you
to make them feel at home.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.080
If he has evolved,
then so can we.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.720
Are the witches
turning against Her Majesty?

02:34.880 --> 02:37.000
No. They're loyal.

02:37.160 --> 02:41.840
Give me the names of your conspirators,
Master Caldwell.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.160
I... I...
I have none.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.080
Make him talk.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.280
Mummo.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.400
You returned at last.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.840
You have suffered, Satu.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.080
Your ancestors didn't survive
amongst others either.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.120
You taught me everything...

05:02.240 --> 05:04.400
...but not who I am.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.440
-Why?
-To protect you.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.240
That's why I raised you here.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.440
I don't want protection.
I want to learn.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.600
-I want to understand.
-Then stay.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.480
Become the weaver
you were born to be.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.200
I'm in a city full of witches.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.720
And I still can't find a teacher.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.920
Have patience.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.880
Master Roydon is resourceful.

06:06.040 --> 06:09.520
It should be a matter
between witches, Francoise.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.560
We need to do
things differently.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.560
Find someone
willing to help me.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.240
They can't be
coerced or bribed.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.720
Difficult.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.560
Mistress Norman may have
talked to others of the...

06:27.920 --> 06:29.960
...fruit incident.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.040
I wonder if Mary knows
of any witches?

06:35.200 --> 06:38.040
-You will enjoy Mary's company.
-Is she a human?

06:38.200 --> 06:41.000
A trusted one. Her late brother
was a close friend.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.160
She practices alchemy.
Fascinating woman.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.080
Though prone to
setting things alight.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.560
-Mary Sidney.
-We'll pay her a visit.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.760
Hal's right,
she could be a useful ally.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.480
Meeting my heroes hasn't been
a wild success so far.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.480
Mary Sidney is nothing like Kit.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.400
Mary?

07:12.560 --> 07:14.080
Matthew!

07:16.240 --> 07:19.440
I understand you are a
fellow student of alchemy.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.800
I am more
an enthusiastic reader.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.080
Diana is being far too modest.
She's an accomplished scholar, Mary.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.800
You could assist me.
If your duties at home permit.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.760
So many things get
in the way of study.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.560
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.680
Still, you and I have an
easier time than most women do.

07:36.840 --> 07:42.440
We have our books and the leisure
to indulge our passions, thank God.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.760
We women own nothing...

07:47.720 --> 07:50.280
...save what lies
between our ears.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.040
Oh, no.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.240
How on earth? Quickly!

08:03.400 --> 08:06.600
Oh. Must've slithered
in from the garden.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.600
Yes, that'll be it.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.600
What a nuisance.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.160
-I don't know how I...
-It's all right. Mary.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.800
We are in need of a witch.
As you can see, it's quite urgent.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.800
I know no witches.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.800
I learned what you are
from my brother as a child.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.320
I understood it to be a fable.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.600
That is how I would like to keep it.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.720
You would deny the truth
of creatures like Diana and I?

08:53.760 --> 08:56.520
-We will trouble you no further.
-Why can't we go on as before?

08:56.680 --> 08:59.520
Because I love Diana and
want to see her secure.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.800
I... I cannot help
you with a witch.

09:08.960 --> 09:13.120
But I gladly offer
you my friendship.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.400
And I mine.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.280
A word of caution, Diana.

09:18.440 --> 09:22.720
No one in London should be trusted
with knowledge of you.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.960
What is happening in Scotland
is making people fearful.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.480
Her Majesty is satisfied
with the events in Scotland?

09:45.640 --> 09:48.520
<i>The distractions facing</i>
<i>King James pleases her.</i>

09:48.680 --> 09:52.880
Good.
I am glad to hear it.

09:53.040 --> 09:57.600
There was an omission, however,
in your statement.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.200
The imprisonment
of Agnes Sampson.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.280
One witch is much
like any other.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.760
I didn't feel the need to
specify any of their names.

10:06.920 --> 10:11.240
One cannot forget your
disdain for witches.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.480
Still, torture of their
leader poses a risk.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.600
English witches may turn
against Her Majesty.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.880
Side with their people
in the north.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.840
England's witches assisted
in repelling the Armada.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.800
Surely their loyalty
is above suspicion?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.320
No one is above suspicion.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.520
And, now,
disturbing news from Garlickhythe.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.280
A minister questioned
one of his parishioners

10:40.440 --> 10:42.680
about suspected witchcraft.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.560
Shortly after, he fell ill.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.920
This does not appear
to be a matter for us.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.000
This witch, Thomas Caldwell,

10:54.160 --> 10:56.800
made threats against the Crown
during his questioning.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.680
It is against our covenant
to meddle in human affairs.

10:59.840 --> 11:03.920
And, yet, here you are, Roydon,
working for us.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.120
Her Majesty has never shown
displeasure with my service.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.880
You are greatly depended on, of course.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.520
Question this Tom Caldwell at the Tower.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.400
Find out what the
witches are plotting.

11:17.560 --> 11:21.920
Extract a confession
by any means necessary.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.800
Yes, My Lord.

11:39.360 --> 11:43.360
Master Roydon.
Welcome back to London.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.880
I suggest you stay where you are.
What do you want?

11:46.040 --> 11:49.320
I've a message
from Father Hubbard.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.920
Ah.

11:51.080 --> 11:54.440
-Well, deliver it.
-He wants to see you.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.240
You can tell Hubbard I'll visit
when it's convenient.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.240
You'll visit tonight.
Before the clock tolls 7:00.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.560
Bring your witch.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.720
Send for Kit.
Tell him a summons came.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.240
From Father Hubbard.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.920
-At once, Master Roydon.
-Diana?

12:27.760 --> 12:29.640
<i>Andrew Hubbard</i>
<i>is a vampire</i>

12:29.800 --> 12:32.920
who rules over
the city of London.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.920
How did the city become his?

12:36.080 --> 12:40.320
Well... The Black Death
arrived in 1348.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.240
If you weren't already dead,
you were trying to flee the city.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.640
Except for one man,

12:45.800 --> 12:49.720
a priest named Father
Hubbard. Now...

12:49.880 --> 12:53.840
He cared for the sick until he finally
succumbed to the illness.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.720
At which point,
he dug himself a grave

12:56.880 --> 13:00.000
and climbed in
"to wait for God."

13:00.160 --> 13:04.800
When he climbed out again,
he prophesied divine resurrection.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.400
-Someone made him a vampire.
-No one claimed to.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.600
So, the creatures
believed his story

13:10.760 --> 13:17.360
and, from then until now, he gathers up
and helps the lost souls of the city.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.560
-That sounds noble.
-Hubbard controls them too.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.320
Or at least tries to.

13:24.480 --> 13:29.440
Under no circumstances are you
to let him taste your blood.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.200
Why would I?

13:31.360 --> 13:33.720
Because it's part of
his ritual of adoption.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.560
He believes that it reveals
the content of their souls.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.800
-But reveals their secrets too?
-Yes.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.480
Promise me.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.320
Yes. Matthew,
why didn't you tell me this?

13:53.640 --> 13:56.800
There is a treaty between Hubbard
and the De Clermont family.

13:56.960 --> 14:00.760
He stays out of our way,
and we stay out of his.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.920
But I fall outside your diplomatic
immunity, is that it?

14:04.080 --> 14:07.000
It's one of the perils
of being a timespinner.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.560
You know the future,
but forget the past.

14:10.720 --> 14:14.640
You would better re-inhabit
your old life, my friend.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.480
Before you
get yourself killed.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.440
Father, I give
my blood willingly,

15:09.600 --> 15:12.560
that God may know
my heart.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.040
I accept your gift

15:16.040 --> 15:19.160
and vow to protect you as my child.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.920
God bless you.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.480
Now, greet your kin.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.960
You're late.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.280
We have a problem.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.320
We have several.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.160
You have your hands upon someone
who doesn't belong to you.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.880
And if you don't step back,
I'll tear this day to pieces...

16:08.040 --> 16:09.840
Hubbard.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.280
Leave us.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.520
<i>Monsieur de Clermont,</i>
I permit your presence because

16:35.680 --> 16:39.080
of my treaty with
your father, Philippe.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.520
But you flout our customs.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.320
Allow this witch to roam.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.280
Then there's the marks.

16:51.440 --> 16:55.960
Relationship between a witch
and a wearh is sin enough.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.200
But this...

16:59.360 --> 17:02.680
If the witches find you
took blood without consent,

17:02.840 --> 17:04.560
you will be put to death.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.280
If she gave it willingly,

17:06.440 --> 17:09.240
then she will be
cast out of England.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.960
Oh, fear not.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.720
Once you are family,
I will protect you.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.320
I do not answer to
you, nor does Diana.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.720
Tell your flock
she belongs to you,

17:21.880 --> 17:24.920
if it brings you comfort,

17:25.080 --> 17:27.040
but you won't
have her blood.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.960
Then we are at an impasse.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.520
-I fed Matthew willingly, Father.
-Diana.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.760
Carry on.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.480
Matthew was dying.

17:45.640 --> 17:49.800
I forced him to take my blood
in order to save his life.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.680
And...

17:51.840 --> 17:53.760
He did so unwillingly?

17:53.920 --> 17:57.760
It was my decision.
And I would make it again.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.960
Yes...

18:08.960 --> 18:12.120
God accepts
your act of mercy.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.080
But know this,

18:14.240 --> 18:18.320
nothing happens in London
without my blessing.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.840
God is watching you both.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.400
Diana.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.120
-I was buying us time.
-That was reckless.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.920
But...

18:47.080 --> 18:49.320
...also brilliant.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.320
Let's get you home.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.880
-Amen.
-Amen.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.400
Is God listening?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.400
I never know.

19:29.480 --> 19:33.320
Do you know,
in all the madness of the arrival,

19:33.480 --> 19:35.680
I missed All Soul's Day.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.080
Let us have fun.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.720
You've forgotten the other side
of Matthew Roydon.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.960
Let me guess.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.080
You still require a loan.

20:07.400 --> 20:11.280
I need to talk to her.
Alone.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.400
Mistress Norman.
Please...

20:15.560 --> 20:18.760
It was wrong to force
you to our home.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.360
But I need you.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.760
I invite you to come.
Master Roydon is out.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.600
Get the contents of this egg

20:42.760 --> 20:45.520
into that bowl without
using your hands.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.600
I... I...

20:47.760 --> 20:50.640
Can we do a different one?
I don't know that spell.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.400
If your power is too weak,
then no witch can help you.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.480
Magic is desire
made real.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.560
I'll speak
to Goody Alsop.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.240
She's your
head of coven?

22:12.560 --> 22:15.360
She is England's
most powerful witch.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.440
-Yes.
-Please.

22:29.080 --> 22:34.320
-Matthew?
-I give up ever so gracefully.

22:34.480 --> 22:38.120
-Hm. It's just you and I.
-Indeed.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.160
The shirt off his back.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.200
<i>-Voila.</i>
-Fair bet.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.320
-Very well.
-Oh, a raise.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.840
A big raise.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.560
I have nothing left.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.880
-Your earring, if you please.
-Oh, Kit.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.120
I mean, it's a thing of beauty.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.520
Oh...

23:11.600 --> 23:15.320
Fine hand!
Good hand, Kit.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.560
-You are a cheater.
-I find that very offensive.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.800
-Gift?
-I chose it especially.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.800
How very thoughtful.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.680
Good evening, gentlemen.

23:34.840 --> 23:38.160
Oh, leave him his shirt, Kit.

23:41.600 --> 23:46.200
Oh. See,
now you look like Matthew Roydon.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.760
Hm.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.520
Gentlemen.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.240
Ah, Peckham.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.960
Are you lost?

24:02.120 --> 24:05.120
What news of Thomas
Caldwell's interrogation?

24:05.280 --> 24:07.880
-It's ongoing.
-It has not begun.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.360
And what does a Whitehall
clerk know of my methods?

24:11.520 --> 24:13.120
I know you've not set foot in The Tower.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.600
I'm allowing my prisoner time to fear.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.880
The potent power of
the imagination, Peckham.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.480
Do not test Lord Burghley's patience.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.240
Do not test mine.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.280
Thank you.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.640
Tell me of your future life.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.920
No, Kit, it isn't wise.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.800
Do you still
write verse?

25:07.360 --> 25:10.560
Not for 70 years or more.

25:10.720 --> 25:13.640
-Read philosophy?
-More science though.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.000
Science.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.360
-Our chemical processes.
-As it evolves.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.120
We have a greater understanding
of the physical and natural world.

25:23.680 --> 25:26.160
So, what questions press you?

25:26.320 --> 25:28.680
The same ones
that always have,

25:28.840 --> 25:30.240
to know why I'm here.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.720
And the future
hasn't answered?

25:34.120 --> 25:36.400
I doubt if it ever will.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.120
What about my work?
Is it still read?

25:41.280 --> 25:45.560
You will not draw me
on your future, Kit.

25:45.720 --> 25:48.440
That way madness lies.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.280
Maddening visions are
a part of my nature.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.320
No man should ever
know their fate.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.240
And yet you know mine.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.800
I must go.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.800
To The Tower,
if you have sense.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.680
Whatever you feel now
about witches,

26:12.280 --> 26:15.120
do not ignore Cecil's orders.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.560
-I'm coming for you.
-Get your coat.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.880
Jack seems to be
settling in well.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.560
Glad to hear it.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.520
Hm.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.440
Why do you have this?

27:03.600 --> 27:06.440
A minister in London
questioned a witch,

27:06.600 --> 27:08.880
a man named Thomas Caldwell.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.440
I'm reading the testimonies.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.560
He used the
<i>Malleus Maleficarum.</i>

27:15.720 --> 27:17.080
Mm-hm.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.600
These questions were used
to trap the innocent.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.840
Thousands of people
were killed this way.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.720
Fortunately, Cecil isn't
bloodthirsty on that score.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.760
Why interrogate a creature
if he knows they exist?

27:31.920 --> 27:34.400
The Queen fears that England's
witches will turn against her.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.000
And unfortunately,
very unfortunately,

27:36.160 --> 27:39.200
under duress, Thomas said some very
foolish things about the crown.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.680
Treason.
But that's a death sentence.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.320
Mm-hm.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.240
Mary was right.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.480
I know what you're thinking, Diana.

27:51.640 --> 27:55.320
I wouldn't have brought you here
if witch hunts were going to break out.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.040
Thank you.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.120
It's 20 years before the
Lancashire hunts begin.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.360
With reasoning like that,

28:03.520 --> 28:05.560
it's a good thing you're a scientist
and not a historian.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.680
Oh, so a historian knows better than
someone who's actually lived through it?

28:08.840 --> 28:12.080
Of course. Look at what's
happening here.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.520
The population is exploding.
Land is being cleared.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.920
Harvest are bad.
Matthew, people are struggling.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.000
So, you think people are looking
for scapegoats as we speak?

28:19.160 --> 28:20.560
One minute we're friends
with our neighbors,

28:20.720 --> 28:22.040
the next, we're running scared.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.960
We will be long gone by the
time that happens, I promise.

28:25.120 --> 28:29.400
Now, Diana, please, please, please,
for the love of God,

28:30.800 --> 28:33.760
let me finish my reading.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.400
Bye.

28:38.560 --> 28:39.880
Thank you.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.760
By the way, I found a teacher.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.320
<i>Stay outside, wearh.</i>

28:48.480 --> 28:51.120
It is Mistress Roydon
she wants to meet.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.760
I'm not leaving Diana alone.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.600
Let me have a look at you.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.240
To keep out prying eyes.

29:18.760 --> 29:22.120
A witch tried to see inside me.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.560
This should not hurt.

29:34.120 --> 29:38.760
I have waited a long time
for you, Diana.

29:40.720 --> 29:45.840
The auguries foretold
your arrival a long time ago.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.880
And with the portents in the north,
I knew to expect you now.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.520
The witch hunts in Scotland.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.560
They have imprisoned
Agnes Sampson.

29:59.880 --> 30:03.400
The three of us are all
that is left of our kind.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.760
"Our kind"?
I don't know what you mean.

30:05.920 --> 30:10.720
You are a weaver.
A maker of spells.

30:10.880 --> 30:14.280
With respect,
I think you're mistaken.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.320
My Aunt Sarah is gifted. I am...

30:17.480 --> 30:20.240
...terrible with spells.
Ask Susanna.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.240
You must devise your own.

30:23.400 --> 30:29.280
There are old stories of witches
with miraculous power.

30:29.440 --> 30:32.320
I've lived a long time, Goody Alsop.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.280
And I've never met one.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.800
We are rare creatures,
Master Roydon.

30:39.960 --> 30:45.080
We have been hunted down
and forced into hiding.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.840
The witch that attacked me
was powerful.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.720
She knew I was different.

30:50.880 --> 30:54.040
Do you think Satu knew
you were a weaver?

30:54.200 --> 30:56.040
I don't know. Maybe.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.960
Sadly, the greatest
threat to our safety

30:59.120 --> 31:00.440
is our own kind.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.600
Envy and fear
are powerful forces.

31:03.760 --> 31:07.200
My parents were
killed by witches.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.840
-Maybe that's why.
-You cannot tell...

31:14.840 --> 31:18.280
...but your father
was one.

31:18.440 --> 31:22.560
He knew that you
would follow his path.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.760
You sense his magic
inside me?

31:25.920 --> 31:27.240
They are seldom men.

31:27.400 --> 31:31.640
He was a self-taught
weaver, Susanna.

31:31.800 --> 31:37.280
I can see the last threads
of his spellbinding...

31:39.800 --> 31:42.120
<i>...roughly woven together.</i>

31:45.440 --> 31:46.800
So...

31:46.960 --> 31:50.600
...it was made with
love to protect you.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.440
Will you teach me,
Goody Alsop?

31:58.800 --> 32:02.120
It will attract
too much attention.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.200
The Rede must be consulted.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.240
If you inform the council of witches,
you will reveal Diana's identity,

32:07.400 --> 32:08.720
and I cannot allow that.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.280
Please sit down,
Master Roydon.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.560
My neck no longer
bends that way.

32:22.400 --> 32:26.120
Diana's presence
is already felt.

32:26.280 --> 32:30.360
We established The Read
to protect our interests.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.560
Their consent is necessary.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.320
Then seek it at once.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Mistress Roydon,
make your case to The Read.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.000
I was spellbound
and orphaned as a child.

32:55.160 --> 32:58.160
Cut off from my essence as a witch.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.120
Now that my
bindings are gone,

33:01.280 --> 33:05.400
I am ready to learn
the full nature of my power.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.640
I need a community
of witches to do that.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.600
We take pity on you, Mistress.

33:10.760 --> 33:13.760
To be spellbound
is a grave thing.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.080
But another city may be a
better place to help you.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.160
No.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.680
No. I am meant to be here.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.400
Mistress Norman,
you have concerns.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.800
I, too, take pity
on Mistress Roydon,

33:28.960 --> 33:33.720
but training her could threaten
the safety of our fellow witches.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.920
How so, Mistress?

33:36.080 --> 33:40.800
She is married to a wearh,
the known enemy of our people.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.880
This is, sadly, true.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.960
As we stand here today,
one of our own is locked in The Tower

33:46.120 --> 33:48.360
with Master Roydon
as inquisitor.

33:48.520 --> 33:55.200
Mistress Roydon's soul
is as clear to me as my own.

33:55.360 --> 33:59.800
Forgive me, but it is not such
an easy matter, Goody Alsop.

33:59.960 --> 34:03.000
If we are to help a witch who
has allied herself with a wearh

34:03.160 --> 34:05.840
over her own people,
then we must be prepared

34:06.000 --> 34:08.200
to make an enemy
of Father Hubbard.

34:08.360 --> 34:11.720
My relationship is not a
rejection of my people.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.560
Dark times are coming.

34:16.720 --> 34:20.560
A witch has long been prophesied
to come to our aid.

34:20.720 --> 34:23.960
Diana is that witch.

34:24.120 --> 34:27.320
Forgive us, but how do we know
that that is true?

34:30.480 --> 34:33.880
I'm a time spinner.
I have come from the future

34:34.040 --> 34:37.040
in order to seek out
a special teacher.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.680
I've seen <i>The Book of Life</i>
with my own eyes.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.400
-The first grimoire?
-Yes.

34:43.560 --> 34:46.680
I don't understand how my
magic is connected to it,

34:46.840 --> 34:49.280
or my purpose once I've
come into my power.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.320
But I do know this...

34:51.480 --> 34:53.840
My relationship to my magic,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.520
to Matthew Roydon
and to <i>The Book of Life</i>

34:56.680 --> 34:58.720
are woven together.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.800
One cannot
exclude the other.

35:06.840 --> 35:12.040
The long awaited
weaver is among us.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.400
This is not a test, Diana.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.800
This is a welcome.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.840
Fine day for an interrogation.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.560
What do you want, Hubbard?

36:02.720 --> 36:07.360
One of my children has been
caught up in Cecil's web.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.040
Tom Caldwell.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.680
Why should that
concern me?

36:14.720 --> 36:16.520
He's innocent.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.160
I think that's for the Crown to decide,
don't you?

36:19.320 --> 36:24.960
The Queen's trusted shadow
can exert influence.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.560
Any influence I may have

36:26.720 --> 36:31.360
won't be spent protecting
your interests, I can assure you.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.000
Good day.

36:34.480 --> 36:38.360
There would be benefit
in our cooperating.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.960
We have a great deal
in common, after all.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.680
Both men of faith.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.920
You're determined to protect Diana
and me, Tom.

36:58.400 --> 37:02.320
Or should I ask Philippe
de Clermont for assistance?

37:05.560 --> 37:09.720
This has nothing to do with him, Andrew.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.560
Let us hope so.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.760
Good day.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.840
Tangled mess!

37:38.000 --> 37:40.640
Hubbard expects me to
free Thomas Caldwell,

37:40.800 --> 37:42.280
and Cecil, Cecil,

37:42.440 --> 37:43.880
demands that I extract
a confession from him

37:44.040 --> 37:46.000
and put him to death!

37:46.160 --> 37:47.560
Contact Philippe.

37:47.720 --> 37:50.000
It can influence the situation
in untold ways.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.280
No. If my father finds
out about Diana,

37:52.440 --> 37:55.000
then everything will become undone.
Everything!

37:55.160 --> 37:57.440
Take my counsel.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.160
Take my counsel.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.680
Dampen Cecil's suspicions.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.960
Your prisoner will
survive for how long?

38:16.320 --> 38:17.880
<i>Two weeks?</i>

38:19.280 --> 38:20.880
<i>Three?</i>

38:24.440 --> 38:28.880
<i>Matthew Roydon is</i>
<i>never cruel for sport.</i>

38:29.040 --> 38:31.960
Father Hubbard
pleaded your case.

38:33.800 --> 38:40.080
<i>But he is ruthlessly efficient.</i>

38:40.240 --> 38:45.360
<i>Do not impersonate</i>
<i>Matthew Roydon.</i>

38:45.520 --> 38:47.200
<i>Become him.</i>

39:21.920 --> 39:24.240
Master Roydon.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.720
Yeah.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.840
The Read will
allow me to train.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.600
Tom?

39:55.760 --> 39:58.080
He didn't suffer.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.320
You killed him out of mercy.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.000
If I was truly merciful,

40:02.160 --> 40:05.920
currently, he would be rowing
himself down the Thames.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.880
He was innocent.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.360
There was no way,
no path where Tom survived

40:16.520 --> 40:18.840
that I can
keep you safe.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.040
He made no threat against me.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.840
Correct.

41:03.920 --> 41:09.400
We gather together
to mourn Thomas Caldwell,

41:09.560 --> 41:12.600
<i>beloved member</i>
<i>of our family.</i>

41:14.680 --> 41:17.200
<i>We keep him in our hearts.</i>

41:18.960 --> 41:21.360
<i>His life was cut short.</i>

41:22.640 --> 41:25.800
<i>But our memories are long.</i>

41:31.600 --> 41:32.920
France, sir?

41:33.080 --> 41:37.560
Put this into the hand of
Philippe de Clermont yourself.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.680
Explain yourself.

41:46.720 --> 41:50.760
The witch refused to cooperate
and became contemptuous.

41:50.920 --> 41:53.200
I lost my temper.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.280
You snapped his neck!

41:56.440 --> 41:58.560
For which I beg
your forgiveness.

41:58.720 --> 42:02.080
It is out of character.

42:02.240 --> 42:06.760
Perhaps you have reason
to side with the traitor,

42:06.920 --> 42:08.920
to support the witches.

42:09.080 --> 42:12.960
My loyalty and devotion
to the Queen are steadfast.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.920
Something I will
remind her of at once.

42:15.080 --> 42:18.680
Her Majesty's in
no humor to see you.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.880
I advise you to remember
the punishment for traitors,

42:23.040 --> 42:25.760
human or creature.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.320
<i>It looked like</i>
<i>an uncontrolled feeding.</i>

42:36.480 --> 42:39.000
<i>Multiple bite marks.</i>
<i>The body was torn apart.</i>

42:39.160 --> 42:41.720
<i>I haven't seen anything</i>
<i>like that in centuries.</i>

42:41.880 --> 42:43.320
Her Majesty questions

42:43.480 --> 42:46.480
the trust she long placed in
you, Master Roydon.

42:46.640 --> 42:50.920
You look tired, Shadow,
marriage does not suit you.

42:51.080 --> 42:55.280
<i>A weaver selects</i>

42:55.440 --> 42:58.440
<i>and shapes something new.</i>

42:58.600 --> 43:01.480
<i>Just let the power</i>
<i>move through you.</i>

43:01.640 --> 43:03.600
You seek a specific text.

43:03.760 --> 43:07.040
An old book of alchemy
in an unknown language.

43:07.200 --> 43:10.240
<i>Dr. Dee</i>
<i>does have such a book.</i>

43:10.400 --> 43:12.800
Acquired from
Emperor Rudolf.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.840
May I see it?
