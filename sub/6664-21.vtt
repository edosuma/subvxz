00:00.066 --> 00:01.433
Adult adam:
<i> Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.435 --> 00:04.103
<i> I saw the movie</i>
princess bride <i> 237 times.</i>

00:04.105 --> 00:07.039
<i> Not just because</i>
<i> it was andre the giant's</i>
<i> greatest performance,</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:10.042
<i> It had magic,</i>
<i> adventure, romance,</i>

00:10.044 --> 00:11.643
<i> Rodents of unusual size,</i>

00:11.645 --> 00:13.579
<i> And the greatest one-liners</i>
<i> of all time.</i>

00:13.581 --> 00:16.181
Inigo: (on tv)
<i> my name is</i>
<i> inigo montoya.</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:17.549
<i> You killed my father.</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:18.317
<i> Prepare to die.</i>

00:18.319 --> 00:20.285
Adult adam: <i> It wasn't enough</i>
<i> to just watch</i>
the princess bride.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.021
<i> I had to experience it.</i>
Inigo: <i> You are better</i>
<i> than I am.</i>

00:22.023 --> 00:23.989
Man: (on tv) <i> then why</i>
<i> are you smiling?</i>
Then why are you smiling?

00:23.991 --> 00:25.691
<i> 'cause I know something</i>
<i> you don't know.</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:27.860
Because I know something
you don't know.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.862
<i> I am not left-handed.</i>

00:29.864 --> 00:31.764
There's something
I ought to tell you.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.932
<i> I'm not</i>
<i> left-handed, either.</i>

00:39.105 --> 00:41.507
(groans)
screw wrapping paper.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.908
We need
some real swords, dude.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.544
Can't you ask your mom?
She never says no to you.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.779
Sure, dave kim.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.580
Let me ask
my safety-crazed mother

00:48.582 --> 00:49.982
For a deadly weapon.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.650
Get your head
in the game, dude.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.985
Maybe you could ask
your dad.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.353
Please.
He hates movies.

00:54.355 --> 00:57.756
All he cares about
are sports
and bread products.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.926
(gasps) wait.
That's it.

01:00.928 --> 01:01.627
Yes. Good.

01:01.629 --> 01:05.264
Fill your mouth
with that delicious
buttered bagel I made you.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.267
While I'm here,
I wanted to ask
for a little favor.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.001
No.
Imagine a world

01:09.003 --> 01:12.771
Where you can
live out your dream
of having an athletic son

01:12.773 --> 01:14.807
Instead of a triple-threat
theater force.
No.

01:14.809 --> 01:18.610
Well, that world
can be yours
for just $250.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.746
No.
'cause with your help...

01:20.748 --> 01:21.980
No.
I can become...

01:21.982 --> 01:23.582
You're gonna love this...
No!

01:23.584 --> 01:25.951
An olympic-class fencer.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.519
Seriously?
Of all sports,

01:27.521 --> 01:29.488
You pick the one
with a pointy sword?

01:29.490 --> 01:32.825
You know how
your mom's crazy
about eye safety. Crazy!

01:32.827 --> 01:35.394
Please.
Fencing is my dream.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.262
I thought your dream
was to be cast as an ewok.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.031
I'm too big now.
Things change.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.400
Just give me
what I want.
(door opens)

01:41.402 --> 01:43.535
Pops,
the voice of reason.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.037
Help me out here,
will you?

01:45.039 --> 01:46.405
Come on, murray.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.139
Don't be such a grump

01:47.141 --> 01:48.674
And let the kid
do it already.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.176
You just walked in.
You don't even know
what we're talking about.

01:51.178 --> 01:54.480
Well, I know the first thing
you always say is no.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.381
Is that what happened here?
He said no?

01:56.383 --> 01:58.350
The moron wants to fence.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.185
I'll spend a fortune
on equipment,

02:00.187 --> 02:01.653
And he'll quit
after the first match.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.189
You know, this reminds me
of a little story.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.325
(sighs) please,
don't tell me a story.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.227
I'm gonna
tell you a story.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.528
When bevy was a girl,

02:09.530 --> 02:12.131
All she wanted
was to be a ballerina.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.000
Sadly, she was
a very early bloomer.

02:15.002 --> 02:18.570
The other little girls
would keep
a wide berth around her

02:18.572 --> 02:19.638
So if she lost
her balance,

02:19.640 --> 02:23.575
They wouldn't be
crushed beneath her
enormous girl body.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.944
Point is,
watching her dance

02:25.946 --> 02:29.047
Is one of the happiest
memories of my life.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.516
Don't you want
to have that with your son?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.017
(groans) why do you
always have to tell

02:32.019 --> 02:34.319
Such wonderful
and touching crap?

02:34.321 --> 02:34.753
Fine.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.289
If this is really your dream,
I'll buy you the sword.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.325
Yes! I'm gonna be like
luke skywalker.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.393
Scratch that.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.794
I'm gonna be like...

02:42.796 --> 02:45.197
Name an athlete
who's really good at sports.

02:45.199 --> 02:48.000
Michael jordan.
Michael jordan!

02:49.569 --> 02:50.936
(groans)

02:50.938 --> 02:53.172
(panting)
just poked my eye.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.540
Oh. It's okay.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.809
I got glasses.
They protected me.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.545
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:59.547 --> 03:04.383
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:05.818 --> 03:06.885
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:06.887 --> 03:10.289
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:10.291 --> 03:12.824
Adult adam:
<i> It was April 22,</i>
<i> 1980-something.</i>

03:12.826 --> 03:13.959
<i> A typical day for my mom...</i>

03:13.961 --> 03:15.294
<i> Power walking</i>
<i> and being a yenta.</i>

03:15.296 --> 03:19.831
You won't believe
what I heard about gabe
and melinda finkleman...

03:19.833 --> 03:20.933
Trial separation.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.468
(gasps) what?
Is he moving out?

03:23.470 --> 03:26.972
No, he's moving
into the room
above their garage

03:26.974 --> 03:28.006
Like fonzie,

03:28.008 --> 03:30.576
Only this time,
it's not cool.
Oh!

03:30.578 --> 03:31.577
(both chuckle)
"ay."

03:31.579 --> 03:34.313
Adult adam: <i> A yenta</i>
<i> is a nickname for</i>
<i> the world's most intrusive,</i>

03:34.315 --> 03:35.480
<i> Loose-lipped gossip monger.</i>

03:35.482 --> 03:36.715
<i> They're the busiest</i>
<i> of busybodies</i>

03:36.717 --> 03:40.385
<i> Who have a talent for making</i>
<i> your business their business.</i>
Psst.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.620
Don't look.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.188
Ginny.

03:43.190 --> 03:43.822
It's linda holman.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.925
Her son brian
is going to cornell,

03:46.927 --> 03:47.826
But the twin, craig,

03:47.828 --> 03:49.695
Is spending the year
traveling abroad

03:49.697 --> 03:51.463
So he can "find himself."

03:51.465 --> 03:52.030
Translation...

03:52.032 --> 03:54.366
He's got a problem
with reefer.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.300
Oh.
So sad.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.603
Adult adam: <i> A good yenta</i>
<i> can dish anytime, anywhere.</i>

03:57.605 --> 03:59.705
Yeah, it's amazing
how marsha's surgery

03:59.707 --> 04:02.574
For sleep apnea
left her so top-heavy.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.942
You know what I mean?
Please!

04:03.944 --> 04:07.079
I need to talk to someone
from the outside world.

04:07.081 --> 04:11.283
<i> But most importantly, a yenta</i>
<i> is an expert matchmaker.</i>

04:11.285 --> 04:12.484
Miss cinoman!

04:12.486 --> 04:13.485
Miss cinoman, allow me.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.320
Why, thank you,
coach mellor.

04:15.322 --> 04:18.090
Please.
Call me coach rick.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.625
Well, look at those two.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.860
They seem to be
getting along nicely.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.629
Don't even think about it.
Think about what now?

04:23.631 --> 04:26.832
You cannot set up
mellor and miss cinoman,
understand?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.233
That's a guaranteed disaster
for us.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.869
Disaster!
How can
bringing together

04:30.871 --> 04:32.938
Two like-minded,
single adults

04:32.940 --> 04:34.806
Over chablis
and assorted cheeses

04:34.808 --> 04:38.176
Possibly turn into
a disaster for you?
(car door closes)

04:38.178 --> 04:39.778
Coach is my coach,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.079
And whenever
he feels feelings,

04:41.081 --> 04:43.982
He makes us run laps
until we feel them, too.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.151
And miss cinoman
is my music teacher.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.620
Spring fling is next week,
and I have a solo.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.155
Don't be you
and ruin this.

04:50.157 --> 04:54.493
Go! Put your foot
on the gas and push.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.529
Well,
this is very hurtful.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.966
Adult adam: <i> As much as my mom</i>
<i> wanted to do right</i>
<i> by erica and barry,</i>

05:00.968 --> 05:02.701
<i> There was no way</i>
<i> she could curb her meddling</i>

05:02.703 --> 05:05.671
<i> When the perfect match</i>
<i> was just around the corner.</i>
(tires screech)

05:05.673 --> 05:08.573
Beverly: Coach mellor!
Hey, it's beverly goldberg!

05:08.575 --> 05:11.276
<i> Meanwhile, all I had to do</i>
<i> was throw one match,</i>

05:11.278 --> 05:14.579
<i> And this fencing sword would</i>
<i> become my awesome movie prop.</i>

05:14.581 --> 05:17.015
Go get 'em, pal.
No worries.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.050
Just do your best
out there.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.652
Listen, I'm kind of running
a grift on my old man,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.654
So what do you say
we give him a good show

05:22.656 --> 05:23.989
And I'll be on
my merry way?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.123
Is your dad like a bad dude
or something?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.926
Is there always
this much talking
before these things?

05:27.928 --> 05:30.495
Let's just do this, bro.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.498
<i> Okay, so maybe it was wrong</i>
<i> to screw over my dad,</i>

05:33.500 --> 05:35.200
<i> But I wanted to be</i>
<i> inigo montoya,</i>

05:35.202 --> 05:38.070
<i> And this was</i>
<i> the least painful way.</i>

05:38.971 --> 05:40.806
(groans)

05:40.808 --> 05:42.507
Oh, no! Oh, no!

05:42.509 --> 05:43.942
Oh, god! Why?

05:43.944 --> 05:44.576
<i> Or so I thought.</i>

05:44.578 --> 05:47.346
Cut it off of me!
Cut the glove off of me!

05:47.348 --> 05:48.714
Intermission.
I call intermission.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.750
<i> While my dad's hope</i>
<i> for a connection with me</i>
<i> took a big hit,</i>

05:51.752 --> 05:54.753
<i> My mom was hoping</i>
<i> for a love connection.</i>

05:54.755 --> 05:58.490
Beverly, thank you so much
for your generous donation

05:58.492 --> 06:00.892
Of unique sweaters
for the holiday concert.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.362
Oh, it's my pleasure.
(doorbell rings)

06:03.364 --> 06:05.230
Oh, well, I wonder
who that could be

06:05.232 --> 06:07.866
At this late
and sexy hour, huh?

06:08.167 --> 06:08.867
How you doing, mrs. G?

06:08.869 --> 06:11.169
I'm here for that
large donation
of sports balls.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.004
Of course.
Come on in.

06:13.006 --> 06:17.275
Uh, did you, uh, jog here?
You seem overheated.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.711
If you ain't running,
you ain't living.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.947
Susan.
Coach rick.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.782
Do you two know
each other?

06:23.784 --> 06:24.516
Are you kidding me?

06:24.518 --> 06:28.053
Work at william penn academy
and not know susan cinoman

06:28.055 --> 06:29.421
Is like looking
at a spice rack

06:29.423 --> 06:31.189
And not knowing
actual cinnamon.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.091
Rick is well-regarded
at school

06:33.093 --> 06:35.861
For both his mind
and his body.

06:35.863 --> 06:39.898
(laughing) I can't believe
I just said that.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.599
Ah, please.

06:40.601 --> 06:44.302
That's why I eat
six pounds of fish
every single day.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.771
Oh!
Feeds both.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.005
Well,
speaking of eating, uh,

06:47.007 --> 06:47.973
Would you like to just
sit back

06:47.975 --> 06:52.110
And enjoy this
open bottle of wine
and beautiful cheese plate?

06:52.278 --> 06:52.711
Sure.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.480
Beverly: Rick, perhaps you'd
like to ask susan something

06:55.482 --> 06:56.748
About herself,
like, um...

06:56.750 --> 06:58.517
Oh, did you know
she used to live in florida?

06:58.519 --> 07:02.053
I do have many questions
for susan.
Oh.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.688
Are you from florida?

07:03.690 --> 07:04.890
Tampa.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.092
I have
a sports background, too.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.794
I grew up
racing greyhound dogs.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.762
You must be
incredibly fast.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.798
I can tell by the size
of your calves

07:12.800 --> 07:14.499
You got
a lot of explosion.

07:14.501 --> 07:15.000
Oh, no.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.802
I raced them
against other dogs.

07:16.804 --> 07:17.803
(chuckles)
oh. Okay.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.705
But no one's ever said that
about my calves before.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.741
Yeah, well, I'm saying it
right now.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.675
Adult adam: <i> There it was.</i>

07:23.677 --> 07:26.445
<i> Another perfect match made</i>
<i> by a world-class yenta,</i>

07:26.447 --> 07:28.780
<i> Much to the dismay</i>
<i> of the yenta's children.</i>

07:28.782 --> 07:32.751
I'm sorry, dad.
I just had to bow out
gracefully.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.187
I wouldn't call that
bowing out gracefully.

07:35.189 --> 07:38.523
You made the referee
carry you to the car.

07:38.525 --> 07:39.758
She was a strong lady.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.159
She was a strong lady.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.662
But the good news is,
is I learned a lot today...

07:43.664 --> 07:46.665
Mostly, swords hurt
when they jab your body,

07:46.667 --> 07:49.201
Which is why I've decided
to retire from the game.

07:49.203 --> 07:54.072
In time, I know,
we'll both be glad
I gave this a shot.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.642
I have to admit
that your story

07:57.644 --> 07:59.344
About bevy dancing
gave me hope.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.047
For a second,
I thought that me and adam

08:02.049 --> 08:04.816
Actually found something
that we both enjoyed.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.419
You know,
this reminds me of a story.

08:07.421 --> 08:08.520
Oh, dear god.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.488
I'll work through it
on my own.

08:09.490 --> 08:13.058
Adult adam: <i> Yep.</i>
<i> I brilliantly played my dad</i>
<i> to get a sword.</i>

08:13.060 --> 08:16.761
<i> Even little bald vizzini</i>
<i> would've called my plan</i>
<i> inconceivable!</i>

08:16.763 --> 08:20.298
Dude!
These swords are badass.
How'd you get them?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.500
Simple. I used
my dad's love of sports

08:21.502 --> 08:23.768
And the awkwardness
of our relationship
to get what I wanted.

08:23.770 --> 08:27.506
Wow. Behind the mask
and glasses lies
a devious mind.

08:27.508 --> 08:31.710
All right, adam and boy
whose name I can't remember.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.044
Give me the swords.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.212
Wait, what? Why?

08:34.214 --> 08:35.213
You quit,
so I'm returning them.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.316
But they're used.
I spoke to the manager
at herman's sports.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.152
He's a total hard-ass.
He won't take them back.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.021
It's store policy,
ironclad.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.222
No, I got some
divorced dad at school

08:44.224 --> 08:46.758
Who wants to buy them
to earn back his son's love,

08:46.760 --> 08:47.392
So hand them over.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.228
But I need them.
I mean...

08:50.296 --> 08:51.463
I have some big news.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.965
You see, I found
an even better use

08:53.967 --> 08:56.434
For expensive
sporting equipment.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.736
Imagination.

08:57.738 --> 09:01.506
Oh, I see
what's going on here.
You played me.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.408
What?
You played me.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.410
Don't insult me like that.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.845
You used
my love of sports

09:06.847 --> 09:09.514
And the awkwardness
of our relationship

09:09.516 --> 09:10.248
To get what you wanted.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.484
Well, I wouldn't use
those words exactly.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.586
You literally did
a minute ago.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.287
Shut up, dave kim!

09:15.289 --> 09:16.755
My name is dave kim,
by the way.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.456
Adult adam:
<i> While I had let my dad down,</i>

09:18.458 --> 09:21.159
<i> My mom was celebrating</i>
<i> the perfect setup.</i>

09:21.161 --> 09:22.561
I did it, ginny.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.564
They stayed past 11:00,
and she drove him home,

09:25.566 --> 09:27.399
Partly because he jogged
to our house,

09:27.401 --> 09:30.302
But partly because
they wanted private time.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.037
Wow.
How do you do it, bev?

09:32.039 --> 09:33.538
Well, I just know
that opposites attract.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.074
I mean,
she's creative and artistic,

09:36.076 --> 09:38.410
And he likes to wear
short shorts in the winter.

09:38.412 --> 09:41.846
Wow. Well, you are just
a matchmaking wizard.
I know.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.916
But you can't tell anyone.
I would never.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.284
This is so juicy.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.320
I know.
But you cannot tell a soul.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.254
I would never.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.021
(telephone rings)
oh!

09:50.023 --> 09:52.891
Adult adam:
<i> The only problem was that</i>
<i> my mom was just a single part</i>

09:52.893 --> 09:54.359
<i> Of an intricate web</i>
<i> of gossiping moms.</i>

09:54.361 --> 09:59.030
<i> Long before the internet,</i>
<i> there was</i>
<i> the worldwide yenta-net.</i>

09:59.032 --> 10:03.768
<i> It was faster than</i>
<i> erica and barry</i>
<i> could've ever imagined.</i>

10:03.770 --> 10:04.669
Yo!

10:04.671 --> 10:05.470
Dude!
Did you hear?

10:05.472 --> 10:07.105
Miss cinoman and mellor
are doing the wild thing.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.108
I heard they hooked up
in the pool and now
they have to drain it.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.611
Oh, god, no.
Where'd you hear that?

10:12.613 --> 10:13.545
Everyone's talking about it.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.046
Apparently they got busy
in the band room

10:15.048 --> 10:17.949
And now they got to
throw away all the oboes.

10:19.085 --> 10:19.818
Oh, this is bad.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.320
Your dopey friends
have the biggest mouths
in school.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.955
No, no, no,
they're cool.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.890
I promise you
it's not as bad as we think.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.125
Everybody stop
your gossiping!

10:27.127 --> 10:29.561
Nobody wants to hear
about susan cinoman

10:29.563 --> 10:31.863
Mashing parts
with that neanderthal.

10:31.865 --> 10:32.998
Get to class.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.200
Yeah, it's bad.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.440
It's come to my attention
that there's been some...

10:42.442 --> 10:46.011
Inappropriate behavior
with members of our faculty.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.446
I am offended
to my very core

10:48.448 --> 10:51.383
That my integrity
would be questioned.

10:51.385 --> 10:52.884
We kissed!
Coach rick.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.519
It absolutely happened.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.787
Big time.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.689
(both chuckle)

10:57.957 --> 11:00.692
I actually
have a question.

11:00.694 --> 11:01.259
Why am I here?

11:01.261 --> 11:04.162
You are here,
because you caused
this kerfuffle.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.364
Now, I don't want to mention
any names,

11:06.366 --> 11:09.300
But there is another
faculty member
that has complained,

11:09.302 --> 11:13.805
And our school's bylaws state
teachers can't fraternize.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.207
Love don't care
about bylaws.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.342
That is beautiful,
coach.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.478
What...He just said
doesn't mean anything.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.713
Look,
one of the two of you

11:21.715 --> 11:23.882
Is going to have to
take a leave of absence.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.350
If someone must go,
then let it be me.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.786
I will be the one who goes
gently into that good night.

11:27.788 --> 11:32.257
Hooray, it's settled.
So, cinoman's out,
mellor's in.

11:32.259 --> 11:32.824
Silver lining.

11:32.826 --> 11:36.961
Now we can go make out
in the supply closet
without fear of punishment.

11:36.963 --> 11:37.862
(laughs)
(growls)

11:37.864 --> 11:39.531
No.
Still not okay.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.168
Adult adam:
<i> Being an all-knowing yenta,</i>
<i> my mom knew exactly</i>

11:43.170 --> 11:45.203
<i> Who complained</i>
<i> about her matchmaking.</i>

11:45.205 --> 11:46.438
<i> It was this man.</i>
(sneezes)

11:46.440 --> 11:48.907
(groans)
<i> the lonely and bitter</i>
<i> mr. Woodburn.</i>

11:48.909 --> 11:51.710
<i> The only solution...</i>
<i> Find a match for him, too.</i>
Damn it!

11:51.712 --> 11:54.546
59 cents worth of noodles
down the drain.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.382
<i> If anybody could get it done,</i>
<i> it was beverly goldberg.</i>

11:57.384 --> 11:57.949
Can't be done.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.984
<i> While my mother</i>
<i> was determined to open</i>
<i> mr. Woodburn's heart,</i>

11:59.986 --> 12:03.988
<i> I was determined</i>
<i> to open my dad's eyes</i>
<i> to</i> the princess bride.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.990
Look, I know
I manipulated you

12:05.992 --> 12:08.259
Into spending hundreds
of your hard-earned dollars

12:08.261 --> 12:10.762
On swords to re-create
an epic movie scene,

12:10.764 --> 12:13.198
And for that,
I'd like to say,
"my mistake."

12:13.200 --> 12:18.103
Oh! Well, as long as
it's your mistake,
all is forgiven.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.370
I can sense your sarcasm,

12:19.372 --> 12:21.406
But I think
once you see that movie,

12:21.408 --> 12:22.941
You'll be
so freaking delighted

12:22.943 --> 12:25.110
That you'll have no choice
but to forgive me.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.745
I'm not watching
that damn movie.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.547
Do you like romance,
pirates,

12:29.549 --> 12:31.483
Wizards, mandy patinkin?

12:31.485 --> 12:33.918
That's a hard no
to all those things.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.921
But what I do like
is my money well spent,

12:36.923 --> 12:39.624
And that's why
I'm gonna
force you to fence.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.894
But I'll get poked again,
and it stings a little!

12:42.896 --> 12:45.530
Pops,
you're the voice of reason.
Help me out here.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.967
Not after the way
you manipulated
your father, kiddo.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.935
That was a real
putz move.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.170
Look, I can't fence.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.340
I have absolutely no idea
what I'm doing.

12:55.342 --> 12:55.840
Lucky for you,

12:55.842 --> 13:00.111
I got a way you can learn
everything about everything.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.981
The encyclopedia?
That's your brilliant answer?

13:02.983 --> 13:05.216
Yes.
"f" for fencing.

13:05.218 --> 13:05.817
Now learn, damn it.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.153
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, back before</i>
<i> google and wikipedia,</i>

13:08.155 --> 13:09.020
<i> The only way</i>
<i> to look stuff up</i>

13:09.022 --> 13:11.823
<i> Was a set of really boring</i>
<i> books that covered a lot,</i>

13:11.825 --> 13:13.625
<i> But said a little.</i>
There.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.659
Fencing.
You're welcome.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.494
Adam: There's just
a small paragraph.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.929
I'll learn nothing
from this.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.633
"z" for zorro.
He was a great fence man.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.134
Oh, please, zorro sucks.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.837
Don't you dare knock zorro!
He is a man of honor.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.372
Then why is he wearing
that stupid mask?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.908
What's he hiding?
All I'm saying is

13:29.910 --> 13:30.875
Zorro had enough skill

13:30.877 --> 13:34.913
To sign a "z"
wherever he went.
A "z"!

13:34.915 --> 13:36.281
Even I can sign a "z."

13:36.283 --> 13:37.882
Oh, I'd like to see that.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.617
Gladly.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.321
(grunting)
(groans)

13:43.323 --> 13:45.190
What'd you do that for?

13:45.192 --> 13:46.324
Don't just stand there!

13:46.326 --> 13:49.060
We're in "f."
find "first aid."

13:49.062 --> 13:49.894
Murray:
Oh, you moron!

13:49.896 --> 13:52.430
Adult adam:
<i> While my dad was feeling</i>
<i> the pain of my blade,</i>

13:52.432 --> 13:53.998
<i> Miss cinoman was gone,</i>
<i> and to coach,</i>

13:54.000 --> 13:55.166
<i> That was as stab</i>
<i> in the heart.</i>

13:55.168 --> 13:59.337
(voice breaking)
hustle up, goldberg!
Pick up the pace!

13:59.339 --> 14:00.939
Coach, are you crying?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.908
You only get one cry in life,
son, and this ain't it.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.144
Now run
till your heart explodes,

14:06.146 --> 14:06.811
'cause...Mine just did.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.913
Adult adam:
<i> As coach mellor was barely</i>
<i> holding it together,</i>

14:08.915 --> 14:13.918
<i> The school choir</i>
<i> had completely fallen apart</i>
<i> without miss cinoman.</i>

14:13.920 --> 14:14.352
Now...

14:14.354 --> 14:17.222
I know you're all wondering
what qualifications

14:17.224 --> 14:19.624
Does your principal have
to teach you music?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.926
Well, rest assured,
I was a baritone

14:21.928 --> 14:24.796
In my high-school
barbershop quartet,

14:24.798 --> 14:25.864
The dapper dougs.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.165
Isn't your name earl?

14:27.167 --> 14:29.868
Yes, but we had a doug,
and he was very assertive.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.703
Sorry.
Now,

14:31.705 --> 14:33.171
Match my pitch.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.139
(note plays)

14:37.142 --> 14:39.077
<i> ¶ I don't hear any singing</i>

14:39.079 --> 14:40.745
(all humming)
<i> ¶ let's go-o-o-o</i>

14:40.747 --> 14:42.413
(deep voice)
<i> ¶ no, you're down here.</i>

14:42.415 --> 14:43.381
(high voice)
<i> ¶ I'm up here</i>

14:43.383 --> 14:44.983
(deep voice)
<i> ¶ you're down here</i>
<i> you're a girl</i>

14:44.985 --> 14:45.984
(high voice)
<i> ¶ I'm a bo-o-y</i>

14:45.986 --> 14:49.721
<i> ¶ you're a principal</i>
<i> what makes you qualified</i>
<i> to teach music?</i>

14:49.723 --> 14:51.756
<i> ¶ no offense</i>
<i> ¶ no offense taken</i>

14:51.758 --> 14:54.425
<i> ¶ but I would be very careful</i>
<i> about that attitude</i>

14:54.427 --> 14:59.464
<i> ¶ it leads you down to</i>
<i> a very dangerous path ¶</i>

14:59.632 --> 15:01.399
(note plays)

15:01.401 --> 15:02.066
(door slams)

15:02.068 --> 15:04.269
Your yenta-ing
has ruined our lives.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.238
Coach mellor canceled
our next wrestling match.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.975
He said without love,
what's the point of sports?

15:10.977 --> 15:11.643
I lost my solo.

15:11.645 --> 15:14.712
Even worse, I'm the bass
in a barbershop quartet.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.015
Principal ball chose me
over matt ramer,

15:17.017 --> 15:18.583
And he's a dude,
a big dude.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.286
Okay. I admit I may have
over-yenta'd,

15:21.288 --> 15:23.187
And for that,
I'm sorry.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.222
But lucky for you,

15:24.224 --> 15:26.858
Your mama's already
in the kitchen
cooking up a plan.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.127
Adult adam:
<i> She had a plan, all right.</i>

15:29.129 --> 15:30.528
Okay, what have we got,
people?

15:30.530 --> 15:34.399
Adult adam: <i> And that plan</i>
<i> was to find love for my</i>
<i> jealous science teacher.</i>

15:34.401 --> 15:36.868
Leads for woodburn.
Talk to me.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.770
We're thinking
edna bishop.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.704
Engaged. Next.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.573
Betty garellick.
Engaged. Next.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.508
Ruth applebaum!

15:43.510 --> 15:45.877
Moved to jersey.
Come on.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.078
I think...

15:47.080 --> 15:48.279
I might know someone.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.114
Who?
Her name is gail kaufman.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.382
She works with me
at gimbels.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.585
She's super clumsy
and dresses in primary brown

15:54.587 --> 15:57.689
And always talks about
her pet lizard.

15:57.691 --> 15:58.690
(all exclaiming)

15:58.692 --> 16:00.625
But more than anything,
I just get the feeling

16:00.627 --> 16:02.927
They would really
like each other,
you know?

16:02.929 --> 16:03.695
I do know.

16:03.697 --> 16:06.431
Oh, and she doesn't have
a ring.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.932
How do I even
know that?

16:07.934 --> 16:09.834
Because all yentas know.

16:09.836 --> 16:10.401
(all laughing)

16:10.403 --> 16:12.837
Oh, my god.
You're one of them!

16:12.839 --> 16:15.206
Oh, don't you dare
say that.

16:15.208 --> 16:15.707
But it's true.

16:15.709 --> 16:18.876
Oh, schmoopie,
I'm so proud of you!

16:18.878 --> 16:21.045
Don't be proud.
'cause I'm not a yenta.

16:21.047 --> 16:24.082
Beverly:
Don't be ashamed. It's a gift.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.150
Hey.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.051
How's your throat skin?

16:27.053 --> 16:31.522
You, uh, stabbed it
with a sword,
so it feels like that.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.491
Here, you can sell this.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.159
I'm sorry
I lied and stuff.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.896
It's fine.
This whole thing
was a mess.

16:38.898 --> 16:43.167
I guess I was just excited
about the overlap.

16:43.169 --> 16:43.801
The what?

16:43.803 --> 16:46.571
The overlap. You know,
you like dumb movies,

16:46.573 --> 16:47.839
I like awesome sports,

16:47.841 --> 16:50.875
And this fencing thing
was finally something

16:50.877 --> 16:52.777
We could both enjoy...

16:52.779 --> 16:53.678
At least
I thought it was.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.980
Adult adam: <i> He was right.</i>
<i> This was no longer</i>
<i> about some silly sword.</i>

16:55.982 --> 17:00.284
<i> It was about sharing</i>
<i> something with my dad,</i>
<i> and I had to fix it.</i>

17:00.286 --> 17:01.919
Dad?
Yeah.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.988
Maybe I could give it
one more try.

17:03.990 --> 17:04.956
Honestly,
you don't have to.

17:04.958 --> 17:08.226
I do. And you know what?
I might even surprise you.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.496
<i> And so, I set out to become</i>
<i> like every brave warrior</i>

17:11.498 --> 17:12.497
<i> Who ever wielded a sword.</i>

17:12.499 --> 17:14.532
<i> The time had come</i>
<i> to be a real hero,</i>

17:14.534 --> 17:18.036
<i> Not just play one</i>
<i> from a movie.</i>

17:20.005 --> 17:21.572
<i> Sadly, fighting for real</i>
<i> was way harder</i>

17:21.574 --> 17:24.075
<i> Than the stage combat class</i>
<i> I took at theater camp.</i>

17:24.077 --> 17:27.178
Adam: You won, gosh!
Dang it! Ahhh!

17:27.180 --> 17:30.681
<i> It was 4-0,</i>
<i> and if I was gonna</i>
<i> win this match,</i>

17:30.683 --> 17:32.950
<i> I'd need more</i>
<i> than an encyclopedia.</i>

17:32.952 --> 17:34.786
<i> I needed a miracle.</i>

17:34.788 --> 17:36.220
(sighs) thank god.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.823
Pops, just the man
I wanted to see.

17:38.825 --> 17:39.824
Tell me what to do.

17:39.826 --> 17:43.795
Hey, look, you got a nickel
in your face mask.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.396
Not the nickel trick now!

17:45.398 --> 17:46.931
I got stabbed
in the face.

17:46.933 --> 17:50.334
I need advice,
real life-saving advice.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.869
Adam, let's just go home.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.671
You'll do
your <i> princess bride</i> thing.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.706
Adult adam: <i> Of course.</i>
<i> That was my answer...</i>

17:55.708 --> 17:58.443
<i> The very movie that brought</i>
<i> me here in the first place.</i>

17:58.445 --> 17:59.143
<i> Just like inigo montoya,</i>

17:59.145 --> 18:02.747
<i> I'd rise up and fight</i>
<i> in the name of my father!</i>

18:02.749 --> 18:05.316
<i> The princess bride.</i>

18:05.417 --> 18:07.185
That's it.

18:08.220 --> 18:08.719
Back for more?

18:08.721 --> 18:11.289
(imitates inigo montoya)
hello. My name
is inigo montoya.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.325
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.927
What now?

18:18.230 --> 18:20.565
Hello.
My name is inigo montoya.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.401
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.170
Dude,
what is your deal?

18:26.572 --> 18:28.973
Hello.
My name is inigo montoya.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.309
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.111
Your father
is right there.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.279
He sold us our sectional.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.317
Attaboy, kiddo!

18:39.319 --> 18:43.087
Murray: (laughs)
my son's gonna be
in the olympics!

18:43.089 --> 18:43.688
In the olympics!

18:43.690 --> 18:46.491
Adult adam: <i> I wasn't,</i>
<i> but I was still a champion</i>
<i> to my dad.</i>

18:46.493 --> 18:48.960
<i> ¶ each morning I get up</i>
<i> I die a little</i>

18:48.962 --> 18:50.261
<i> ¶ can barely stand</i>
<i> on my feet</i>

18:50.263 --> 18:52.196
Chorus:
<i> ¶ take a look at yourself</i>
<i> in the mirror</i>

18:52.198 --> 18:54.298
Adult adam: <i> And even though</i>
<i> erica refused to admit</i>
<i> she was a yenta...</i>

18:54.300 --> 18:55.967
<i> ¶ lord,</i>
<i> what you're doing to me</i>
<i> she got her solo back</i>

18:55.969 --> 18:58.870
<i> Thanks to</i>
<i> the matchmaking skills</i>
<i> she learned from my mom.</i>

18:58.872 --> 19:02.039
Erica, thank you
for telling me
about the big sale

19:02.041 --> 19:03.741
On brown pants
and shirts.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.243
Of course.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.211
Could I get my co-worker
to help you?

19:07.213 --> 19:07.979
I'm kind of slammed today.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.749
Gail, would you mind
helping my friend here
find some slacks?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.618
<i> ¶ somebody to love?</i>

19:13.620 --> 19:14.085
Hi.

19:14.087 --> 19:15.419
I bet you'd be
interested to know

19:15.421 --> 19:17.288
Gail here
has a giant lizard.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.356
Emerald tree
or spiny-tailed?

19:18.358 --> 19:20.892
I'll tell you all about it
while you try on
some corduroys.

19:20.894 --> 19:23.461
(chuckles) okay.
(chuckles) okay.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.229
This way.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.666
Schmoopie.
Oh, no.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.600
No proud hugs.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.935
(chuckles)
I'm not a yenta.

19:30.937 --> 19:31.969
Not even a little yenta?

19:31.971 --> 19:33.137
Do you want to hide
in a dressing room

19:33.139 --> 19:34.305
So we can hear
what they're talking about?

19:34.307 --> 19:37.508
We'll stop by housewares
and get a glass
to press against the wall.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.209
Move, move, move.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.811
Adult adam: <i> Once mr. Woodburn</i>
<i> had conveniently met</i>
<i> his perfect match,</i>

19:40.813 --> 19:44.348
<i> He didn't care so much about</i>
<i> miss cinoman and coach rick.</i>

19:44.350 --> 19:46.317
<i> And that's the power</i>
<i> of the yenta.</i>

19:46.319 --> 19:48.219
<i> Despite the gossip</i>
<i> and meddling...</i>

19:48.221 --> 19:52.056
<i> All they really want</i>
<i> is to find</i>
<i> each single person</i>

19:52.058 --> 19:53.558
<i> Somebody to love.</i>

19:53.560 --> 19:55.026
Coach, are you crying?

19:55.028 --> 19:59.630
You only get
one cry in life, son,
and this is it.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.199
Can we stop running now?

20:01.201 --> 20:03.868
<i> ¶ till the tears run down</i>
<i> from my eyes, lord</i>

20:03.870 --> 20:06.571
<i> ¶ somebody</i>
adult adam: <i> Even though</i>
<i> I grew up in a small town...</i>

20:06.573 --> 20:09.273
<i> We still had our fair share</i>
<i> of adventure and romance.</i>

20:09.275 --> 20:12.109
<i> And while my dad</i>
<i> wasn't much for either...</i>

20:12.111 --> 20:15.379
<i> We still managed</i>
<i> to find our overlap.</i>

20:15.381 --> 20:16.847
<i> 'cause that's the thing</i>
<i> about family.</i>

20:16.849 --> 20:19.784
<i> Sometimes they demand a lot,</i>
<i> but you love them so much...</i>

20:19.786 --> 20:24.088
<i> You can't help but give in</i>
<i> and say, "as you wish."</i>

20:24.090 --> 20:26.190
Dad, what are you...

20:26.192 --> 20:29.894
I, uh, watched the movie,
and it's not bad.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.830
<i> ¶ somebody to love ¶</i>

20:32.832 --> 20:34.198
(chuckles)

20:34.200 --> 20:36.867
Okay, let's, uh,
get this over with.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.136
Okay.
So, come over here.

20:39.138 --> 20:43.074
Stand right there
and try and look enormous.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.710
There we go.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.880
Helen schur says her son
is working on wall street.

20:49.882 --> 20:53.684
I just saw him
bagging groceries
at walmart.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.286
(groans)
I need the phone!

20:55.288 --> 20:58.089
You've literally been on it
for seven hours!

20:58.091 --> 21:00.858
I'm telling you,
dottie anderson's leg...

21:00.860 --> 21:02.026
100% wood.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.429
Four carats my ass,
linda schwartz. (laughs)

21:05.431 --> 21:08.099
We all know
she's sporting a cubic z.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.268
Oh, they don't
own that house.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.535
They're renters.

21:11.537 --> 21:12.103
Said that.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.273
You said that.
You said that.
(inaudible)

21:16.875 --> 21:19.610
(indistinct conversation)

21:19.612 --> 21:21.412
(bell dings)

21:24.383 --> 21:26.117
(bell dings)
