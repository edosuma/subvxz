How'd you sleep?

Sure.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.850

02:20.891 --> 02:22.601
was it okay?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.271
I mean, you know, was it fun,
did you have a good time?

Yes, Sam.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.695

02:44.164 --> 02:45.916
-I insist.
-Mm-mm.

No, I am not parading around

You first.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.472
Uh-uh.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.016
No.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.476
Well, then I guess we're both

03:04.518 --> 03:07.271
just gonna have to spend
the whole day in this bed.

03:07.313 --> 03:08.939
I guess we are.

big blue one right there?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.426
You have good taste.

03:37.468 --> 03:40.763
It's inspired
by Lady Diana's engagement ring.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.349
Cool. Um...

03:43.390 --> 03:46.977
-how much is it?
-$3,995.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.730
Okay, um...

03:49.772 --> 03:52.149
what about that one right there?

03:52.191 --> 03:56.070
That's a princess cut diamond
in a setting of 18-karat gold.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.657
-How much?
-$2,700.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.950

$800.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.919
Seriously? That's not bad.

04:11.961 --> 04:14.004

how can you put a price

04:53.043 --> 04:55.629

learned to swim,

04:55.671 --> 04:59.466

04:59.508 --> 05:02.219

05:02.261 --> 05:04.555

daughter's wedding,

05:04.596 --> 05:06.682
where you renewed
your own wedding vows?

05:06.724 --> 05:07.975
Hmm?

05:08.017 --> 05:09.393
The answer is...

05:09.435 --> 05:12.479
you can't put a price
on such a place.

-I could marry your sister,

08:15.162 --> 08:18.332
get a job running the A/V club

08:18.373 --> 08:19.583
maybe take up storm chasing.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.390

08:35.432 --> 08:37.309
you're not allowed
to move to Omaha

08:37.351 --> 08:39.603
and become an A/V teacher
because, for one thing,

08:39.645 --> 08:42.564
then I would have no one
to talk to at work.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.858
-MAN (over Walkman):
...tomodachi

10:07.899 --> 10:09.359
-anata no koto...
-Tomo... To... Shit.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.403
I... Fuck!

10:20.620 --> 10:22.789
Heatstroke.

10:23.874 --> 10:27.002
Douglas Getty.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.714
He's right there.

10:33.216 --> 10:34.885
-Douglas.
-Thank you for coming.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.136
I really appreciate it.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.180
Ah. I hope you weren't expecting

10:38.221 --> 10:39.848
-a conjugal visit.
-(chuckles)

10:39.890 --> 10:41.350
Don't worry about that.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.518
That's, uh, that's not why
I called you here.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.937
Listen...

10:45.979 --> 10:47.356
I need a favor.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.027
You want me to return a movie
to the video store?

10:52.069 --> 10:54.363
(sighs) It's not a movie.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.822
This is a message

10:55.864 --> 10:58.200
from me to the members
of Red Oaks.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.785
What kind of message?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.119
Don't sell.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.747
Oy vey. Why me?

11:03.789 --> 11:04.998
'Cause you're on the board.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.042
You can make sure people see it.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.002
Not many minds are gonna change.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.296
Including mine.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.256
What are you talking about?

11:13.298 --> 11:16.301
I don't get it. Herb, you?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.345
I thought you loved Red Oaks.

11:18.387 --> 11:21.223
-Yeah, I loved
all my ex-wives, too. -(sighs)

11:21.264 --> 11:23.100
But there comes a time
when a man has to look

11:23.141 --> 11:25.102
for greener pastures.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.645
In Boca.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.980
Weren't a lot
of greener pastures

11:29.022 --> 11:30.315
down there last time I checked.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.650
Mainly alligators.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.944
I can't stand the cold.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.529
Jews are a desert people.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.823
We were not meant
to shovel snow.

11:37.864 --> 11:41.451
And change is not
such a terrible thing.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.706
Herb, you're killing me.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.918
I-- listen, I have given
a lot of years

11:49.960 --> 11:51.211
to that club,

11:51.253 --> 11:54.131
and I think
I deserve to be heard.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.176
Give me the goddamn tape.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.886
Thank you.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.350
(slurps oyster)

12:05.392 --> 12:08.395
(Wheeler sighs)

12:08.437 --> 12:10.689
(Wheeler slurps)

12:13.400 --> 12:15.068
Why are you eating oysters?

12:15.110 --> 12:18.113
Had a hankering.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.698
Is that even safe?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.408
Why wouldn't it be?

12:21.450 --> 12:23.910
'Cause it's August
and a thousand degrees in here.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.370
Dude, New Yorkers
have been enjoying oysters

12:25.412 --> 12:27.122
in the summertime for years.
Before the Nazis

12:27.164 --> 12:28.957
invented hot dogs,
every street corner in the city

12:28.999 --> 12:31.251
-had an oyster cart.
-Okay.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.752
Want one?

12:32.794 --> 12:35.505
No, thanks.
I'm meeting my dad for dinner.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.716
What's Big Sam doing
in the city?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.593
He and his girlfriend
are seeing Cats.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.219
Know what's funny?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.846
Your dad has a girlfriend
and you don't.

12:42.888 --> 12:45.140
Yeah, that's hilarious.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.225
(chuckles)

12:47.267 --> 12:49.478
-What is this?
-Nothing.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.730
Why are you icing your balls?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.108
I just felt like it.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.651
What the fuck is going on, dude?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.195
(sighs)

12:58.236 --> 13:00.197
Jockey underpants
cause your sack to overheat

13:00.238 --> 13:01.907
and cook your sperm.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.700
And oysters have a ton of zinc,

13:03.742 --> 13:06.203
which boosts your sperm count
and makes them swim faster.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.746
-Are you trying
to knock Misty up? -No!

13:07.787 --> 13:09.873
Jesus Christ. God forbid.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.083
I mean, someday, for sure,
it'd be awesome

13:12.125 --> 13:14.753
to have, like, six or seven kids
with her, but...

13:14.794 --> 13:16.129
-there's no rush.
-Then why are you trying

13:16.171 --> 13:17.464
to level-up your nuts?

13:17.506 --> 13:20.217
Because I want to knock up
my lit professor.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.929
It's not what you think.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.266
There's zero intercourse.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.602
All I have to do
is jizz in a cup.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.103
And why exactly
are you doing this?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.647
Because her husband
is shooting blanks,

13:33.688 --> 13:35.065
and I feel sorry for them.

13:35.106 --> 13:38.401
Also, they're paying me
150 bucks a squirt,

13:38.443 --> 13:41.446
with a big bonus
when she gets a... you know.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.449
Bun in the Easy-Bake.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.494
-And Misty's okay with this?
-No.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.663
No. She doesn't know.

13:49.704 --> 13:52.207
I feel bad, but I figure
I'm doing this for her, so...

13:52.249 --> 13:55.001
Wait, how is impregnating
your professor

13:55.043 --> 13:56.378
doing something for Misty?

13:56.419 --> 13:57.504
Because I'm gonna use the money

13:57.546 --> 13:58.630
to buy her an engagement ring.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.923
What the hell? You just said

13:59.965 --> 14:01.049
you weren't in any rush.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.842
To have kids, no.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.553
But I got to do something
to take things

14:04.594 --> 14:05.929
to the next level,
or I could lose her.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.389
It's about Dr. Ron, isn't it?

14:07.430 --> 14:08.974
You didn't see this guy.
He looks like

14:09.015 --> 14:10.642
when he's not fixing teeth,
he's fighting crime.

14:10.684 --> 14:11.977
Wheeler, you've done

14:12.018 --> 14:13.436
some stupid shit,
but this is, like,

14:13.478 --> 14:15.105
Olympic-caliber stupidity.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.565
You don't know
what it's like, man.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.316
You've always
had hot girlfriends.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.985
Present moment excepted.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.654
Guys like me, we don't
usually get girls like Misty,

14:22.696 --> 14:24.281
and we definitely don't
hold onto them

14:24.322 --> 14:26.866
-without stepping up our game.
-This isn't stepping up.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.119
This is acting desperate,
and you're gonna fuck things up.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.495
Yeah, well,
at least I'm doing something

14:30.537 --> 14:31.580
and not just sitting around

14:31.621 --> 14:32.956
feeling sorry for myself.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.291
What's that supposed to mean?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.627
Forget it.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.422
No, go ahead. Say it.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.007
(exhales)

14:42.048 --> 14:44.050
Ever since that dickweed Derek
shit on your reel,

14:44.092 --> 14:45.510
you've been moping around
like a dog

14:45.552 --> 14:47.262
that just got his nuts cut off.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.723
-What do you expect me to do?
-Get angry. Do something!

14:49.764 --> 14:51.016
Oh, I'm getting angry,
all right.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.561
You know,
I hope you get your bonus,

14:54.603 --> 14:57.397
because it'd be nice if you paid
your part of the fucking rent.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.274
(bottle cap rattles)

14:59.316 --> 15:01.901
(door opens, slams)

15:01.943 --> 15:03.570
(sighs)

15:10.160 --> 15:12.287
SAM:
An elephant with so many arms.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.372
Wonder if they pray to him
or they just toss him peanuts?

15:14.414 --> 15:17.375
-Sam, hush.
-(chuckling): I'm just teasing.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.586
I think that God
has a sense of humor.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.838
Well, theirs might not.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.341
Well, the way I see it...

15:24.382 --> 15:26.217
there's only one Guy Upstairs.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.595
To the Hindus,
He looks like Dumbo.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.431
To the Baptists,
He looks like Kenny Loggins.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.849
And to the Jews...

15:32.891 --> 15:35.310
to the Jews,
He looks like Leonard Bernstein.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.978
-(chuckles)
-But at the end of the day,

15:37.020 --> 15:39.606
I think all the prayers
go to one postal address.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.983
You are an unusual man,
Sam Meyers.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.193
(both chuckle)

15:43.234 --> 15:46.237
SAM:
Oh, here he is.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.697
-How are you?
-Good.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.658
-I'm David.
-So nice to finally meet you.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.035
-Likewise. -David,
do me a favor. Order for us.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.411
-We've never had Indian before.
-Mm-hmm.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.246
Oh, okay. Yeah, sure.
Let me, uh...

15:55.288 --> 15:57.707
SAM: David's always been
a very adventurous eater.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.918
He'll put anything in his mouth,
even as a baby.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.378
Put in crayons, bugs.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.630
One time, right,
even put in dog dirt.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.632
-Dad. -Sam, don't you go
embarrassing him.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.176
It's my job. I have to.
(chuckles)

16:08.218 --> 16:10.178
Well, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

16:10.220 --> 16:12.263
I'm gonna go sneak off
to the ladies'.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.309
You okay?

16:16.351 --> 16:17.852
Fine.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.689
Wheeler and I got in a fight.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.191
Roommates.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.734
So, what do you think?

16:24.776 --> 16:27.070
Uh, we should probably start
with the samosas.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.488
No, no, no, about Shirley.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.074
Oh, yeah. Nice.
Yeah. Really nice.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.575
SAM:
Yeah.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.370
Yeah. Hey, you don't mind
that she's, uh...

16:36.788 --> 16:37.956
(whispers):
Well, you're not upset that,

16:37.997 --> 16:38.957
you know, she's black?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.917
Why would I be upset?

16:40.959 --> 16:42.836
I knew that you wouldn't be.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.129
It's just I didn't want

16:44.170 --> 16:45.588
to spring this on you
without warning.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.425
I don't need warning.

16:48.466 --> 16:51.261
I know.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.140
Okay.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.976
(piano playing softly)

17:00.019 --> 17:02.439
E-Excuse me, Rebecca.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.983
-May I have a word, please?
-(chuckles)

17:05.024 --> 17:06.901
We were just about
to go in to dinner.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.445
It will only take a moment.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.904
You go on ahead.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.990
I'll-I'll catch up.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.992
What is it?

17:14.033 --> 17:16.244
Have the Japanese
made their offer yet?

17:16.286 --> 17:18.288
Yes. Mr. Shimada
and his partners

17:18.329 --> 17:20.707
have made a rather generous one.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.876
So what happens now?

17:22.917 --> 17:26.755
Well... the board brings it
to membership for a vote

17:26.796 --> 17:28.673
in the next few weeks.

17:30.133 --> 17:33.303
I wonder
if I could ask you a favor.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.014
Would you put in a good word
on my behalf?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.224
I know that ordinarily
they would be inclined

17:38.266 --> 17:40.477
to replace me with
a teaching pro of their own,

17:40.518 --> 17:42.353
but perhaps
with your recommendation,

17:42.395 --> 17:45.356
they might see fit
to keep me on.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.025
Oh, Nasser, I...

17:47.066 --> 17:49.319
I thought you knew.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.904
You thought I knew what?

17:50.945 --> 17:53.823
Mr. Shimada and his partners
aren't interested

17:53.865 --> 17:56.493
in taking over the management
of Red Oaks.

17:56.534 --> 18:00.163
They intend
to close down the club.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.290
I beg your pardon?

18:02.332 --> 18:04.542
It's not the club they want,
it's the land--

18:04.584 --> 18:06.461
for a housing development.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.967
I see.

18:15.345 --> 18:18.598
Well, it would appear that
all my Japanese language lessons

18:18.640 --> 18:20.850
were for naught.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.852
I'm sorry.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.021
Would you excuse me, please?

18:25.063 --> 18:27.482
I need to go update my résumé.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.199
Thank you.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.785
Thanks.
Well, we better shake a leg

18:38.827 --> 18:40.620
if we're gonna make it
to the theater.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.205
Mm. Well, good night, David.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.581
It was such a pleasure.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.667
-Yeah, I hope I see you
again soon. -Mm-hmm.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.418
SAM:
You going back to the apartment?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.712
-Thought I might take a walk.
-Okay, well, you have fun.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.130
-Say hey to Wheeler.
-I will.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.465
Okay.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.178
(sighs)

18:59.806 --> 19:01.891
CECIL:
Come in, come in.

19:01.933 --> 19:05.854
Now, Bee's just in the bedroom
checking her temperature.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.856
Now, can I get you anything?

19:07.897 --> 19:09.649
No, I'm okay, thank you.

19:09.691 --> 19:13.111
FOX:
Dear, brave Wheeler.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.197
-Hi, Professor. -I think
given the circumstances,

19:16.239 --> 19:19.868
that you should call me Beryl.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.411
Okay. Cool.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.871
Beryl.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.080
Are you ready?

19:24.122 --> 19:25.874
(sighs heavily)

19:25.915 --> 19:27.250
I think so.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.127
-Where do I...?
-The powder room

19:29.168 --> 19:31.296
is down the hall.

I thought it was great--
I mean, the music

20:09.125 --> 20:11.961
and the costumes-- but I thought
it was a little unrealistic.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.756
Because my cat Gracie,
I've never heard her sing.

20:14.797 --> 20:18.843
(laughs) Well, maybe she
just waits until you leave.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.553
What? I... Hey! Stop!

20:20.595 --> 20:23.139
-He...
-Hey! Hey!

20:23.181 --> 20:24.182
Oh...

20:27.352 --> 20:29.687
Son of a bitch.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.564
(panting)

20:33.441 --> 20:34.609
(grunts)

20:34.651 --> 20:36.277
Damn it!

20:37.820 --> 20:39.489
(panting)

20:42.951 --> 20:45.536
(exhales)
Come on, dude, you can do this.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.246
Just focus.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.040
-(knocking on door)
-Yes?

20:49.082 --> 20:51.250
CECIL: Everything okay
in there, old man?

20:51.292 --> 20:53.711
Fine. Sorry I'm taking so long.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.380
No apology necessary.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.548
No rush. Take your time.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.967
Okay.

20:59.008 --> 21:02.178
I brought you something
that might help.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.182
What is this?

21:06.224 --> 21:10.353
18th century erotic
French poetry.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.980
Okay.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.107
You do read French, don't you?

21:14.148 --> 21:15.316
No.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.693
Oh.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.695
You have any fashion magazines

21:18.736 --> 21:20.196
or a Victoria's Secret catalog?

21:20.238 --> 21:21.572
Afraid not. Oh!

21:21.614 --> 21:23.199
But I do have a delightful book

21:23.241 --> 21:26.452
of pornographic mosaics
from Pompeii and Herculaneum.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.704
I'll just fetch it.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.792
WHEELER: Sorry, we're not in,
but leave a message

21:32.834 --> 21:34.669
and we'll get back to you
at some future juncture.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.920
(line beeps)

21:35.962 --> 21:37.588
-(coin drops)
-Did you get them?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.549
Just the machine.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.884
Well, wh-what do we do now?

21:41.926 --> 21:44.887
Catch a cab,
hope they take credit cards.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.723
But-but how
will I get into my house?

21:46.764 --> 21:48.891
My-my keys were in my purse.

21:48.933 --> 21:52.186
Anyone you know have a spare?

21:52.228 --> 21:53.688
Yes.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.773
My brother.

22:04.782 --> 22:05.825
(gasps)

22:05.867 --> 22:07.910
Success?

22:10.788 --> 22:12.915
Well done!
(chuckles)

22:12.957 --> 22:14.333
Thank you.

22:17.795 --> 22:18.921
SAM: It was
the damnedest thing, Terr.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.090
He came out of nowhere,
like a ninja or something.

22:21.132 --> 22:24.802
You know, I tried to chase him,
but h-he was just too fast.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.846
-Get in the car.
-I'm telling you,

22:26.888 --> 22:29.182
this city's going to the dogs--
and I blame Koch.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.434
-He's too soft on crime.
-Shut up.

22:31.476 --> 22:34.103
-Oh, come on, Terry.
-Just get in the back.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.152
Listen, Terry...

22:41.194 --> 22:43.613
I'm sorry that you had
to find out about us this way.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.323
We were gonna tell you
earlier, honest.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.159
It's just... we were waiting
for the right time.

22:48.201 --> 22:51.037
Right time?
There is no right time.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.997
What does that mean?

22:53.039 --> 22:54.540
That's my sister.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.084
My baby sister!

22:56.125 --> 22:58.002
I'm 48-years-old.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.546
-She's vulnerable; she
just got divorced. -Oh, please.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.381
Like, three years ago.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.841
Didn't I say get in the car?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.345
Fine.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.056
(door opens)

23:11.724 --> 23:13.351
Thank you.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.274
You took advantage of her,
and you know it.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.360
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have been sneaking around.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.320
Come on, Terry.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.947
Don't "Terry" me, motherfucker.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.910
You're a racist.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.329
You son of a...

23:33.371 --> 23:34.997
(scoffs)

23:35.039 --> 23:38.084
You got five seconds
to get in this goddamn car,

23:38.126 --> 23:40.128
or you can walk.
