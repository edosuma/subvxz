00:02.040 --> 00:06.636
As far back as 1938 the director
of the FBI, J Edgar Hoover,

00:06.720 --> 00:11.840
wrote to the then curator of the Jeffersonian
Institution, Professor DanieI Payne,

00:11.920 --> 00:16.550
to aid in the evaluation of specimens
who were thought to be irrefutably human.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.756
This was the result.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.477
Despite this disagreement,
the FBI and the Jeffersonian

00:24.560 --> 00:29.236
have forged a mutually beneficiaI
if somewhat tense relationship

00:29.320 --> 00:31.754
which survives to this day.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.831
Thank you.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.759
Thank you, Dr Brennan. Are
there any questions? Yes?

00:40.840 --> 00:46.358
- How much have you made from your book?
- I don't really know. I have an agent...

00:46.440 --> 00:50.991
That's not the kind of question we're
looking for from an anthropology student. Yes?

00:51.080 --> 00:53.548
Did you get your agent
before you wrote the book?

00:53.640 --> 00:57.474
People, Dr Brennan is an
accomplished forensic anthropologist

00:57.560 --> 00:59.437
who writes books on the side.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.557
I have a question regarding
the FBI's role in your book.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.519
Who do you base brilliant and
insightfuI SpeciaI Agent Andy Lister on?

01:06.600 --> 01:08.830
Oh, for God's sake.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.878
- I'm pretty sure it was me.
- What are you doing here, Booth?

01:11.960 --> 01:16.272
LocaI police got an anonymous call
saying there were human remains

01:16.360 --> 01:19.193
in a field behind a
mall out in the suburbs.

01:19.280 --> 01:24.149
I did a profile of the suburb as a grad
student. The whole notion of a created community,

01:24.240 --> 01:27.835
a modern utopia with its own
mores and rules is fascinating.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.751
Fascinating to who?

01:29.840 --> 01:33.196
<i>- To whom.
- Whom. You gotta be kidding.</i>

01:33.280 --> 01:36.352
- What? My publishers gave it to me.
- Gave it to you?

01:36.440 --> 01:39.557
Book sales are pretty good.
It's supposed to be a nice car.

01:39.640 --> 01:44.589
- Gave it to you? Why did you park crooked?
- Well, the guy said to always park it like that.

01:44.680 --> 01:48.229
- He's wrong. Makes you look like an idiot.
- How about I drive?

01:48.320 --> 01:52.279
- I cannot show up at a crime scene in that.
- Why?

01:52.360 --> 01:55.989
Because it would detract from
the gravity of my FBI presence,

01:56.080 --> 01:58.150
especially if you parked crooked.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.313
Why is the FBI involved in the search
for human remains behind a suburban mall?

02:02.400 --> 02:05.073
Because this boy is missing.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.912
<i>Oh.</i>

02:07.000 --> 02:09.275
- A child.
- Yeah.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.988
Anonymous call came
in a couple hours ago.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.878
- No sign of him yet.
- How do you know it wasn't a prank?

02:16.960 --> 02:21.670
<i>Y ou have to come right away. There's,
like, a dead kid here all rotted away.</i>

02:21.760 --> 02:25.150
<i>He's in the field behind Clayton
Hills Mall. Y ou better come!</i>

02:25.240 --> 02:27.037
- That rings true.
- Why anonymous?

02:27.120 --> 02:29.429
Kids come here to party, misbehave.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.876
Adolescents and preadolescents
tend to seek their own space,

02:32.960 --> 02:37.033
to establish their own society,
to counter parentaI influence.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.476
- You mind if I make an observation?
- No, of course not.

02:40.560 --> 02:45.031
In your book the cops come off as
very one-dimensionaI. Why is that?

02:45.120 --> 02:50.752
- You mean two-dimensionaI. -
One-dimensionality exists only in theory.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.637
OK.

02:52.720 --> 02:58.716
- Really looking forward to your next book.
- Did you bring the thermaI imager?

02:58.800 --> 03:02.759
I don't think we need it. It
makes me look like the Great Gazoo.

03:02.840 --> 03:07.834
I don't know what that means
but we definitely need it, Zack.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.549
How's it going there, Darth?
See anything on Saturn?

03:15.360 --> 03:18.033
<i>Oh, please tell me you've
seen one Star Wars movie.</i>

03:18.120 --> 03:22.671
- When I was seven. And leave Zack alone.
- Can we please hurry up? It's stuffy in here.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.959
I should be able to see any heat
residue released from decomposing bodies.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.396
<i>- Party centraI.
- Because suburbs are so homogeneous,</i>

03:31.480 --> 03:34.950
adolescents tend to rebeI in
predictable and uniform ways.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.430
Fire, illicit substances,
wayward behaviour.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.592
Do you think that would include
abducting a six-year-old?

03:41.680 --> 03:45.070
It's extreme. Adolescents are
more likely to drink alcohoI

03:45.160 --> 03:49.073
and listen to culturally
inappropriate music at high volume.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.277
<i>I'm picking something up.</i>

03:52.360 --> 03:54.749
<i>- Oh, my God.
- What?</i>

03:56.640 --> 03:58.596
Why'd you stop?

03:58.680 --> 04:01.274
You can turn on your flashlight,

04:01.360 --> 04:04.557
aim it over here.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:45.640 --> 04:50.919
<i>Before proceeding with maceration,
any generaI observations? Zack?</i>

04:51.000 --> 04:54.549
EpiphyseaI fusion puts the age
at approximately 6 to 10 years,

04:54.640 --> 04:59.794
- though the stature suggests younger.
- Good. I concur. Cause of death?

04:59.880 --> 05:02.269
Blunt trauma to the chest.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.916
Are you all right?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.356
He's so small. That's all.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.954
Go on with your work. I'm OK.

05:12.040 --> 05:16.875
The remains were significantly degraded
by animaI activity, mostly dog and rodent.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.669
Despite the condition of the body
he's been dead only 36 to 48 hours.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.194
These were found a few
yards from the body.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.999
In perfect condition.
What does that tell you?

05:26.080 --> 05:32.076
- He wasn't wearing them when he was killed.
- Which suggests he was sexually assaulted.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.151
I'm done.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.514
<i>I think we have a match.</i>

05:41.920 --> 05:43.990
The clothing matches.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.640
It's Charles Gregory Sanders.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.631
<i>On behalf of the FBI, we're extremely
sorry for the loss of your son.</i>

05:51.720 --> 05:55.952
I have a few questions. I
mean, only if you're up to it.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.996
You have two other sons?

05:59.080 --> 06:01.958
Foster sons. Though I try
not to make the distinction.

06:02.040 --> 06:06.352
Shawn and David Cook. They are
brothers. I live right next door.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.034
Charlie was your own?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.553
Yes.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.952
- Charlie was mine.
- What about Mr Sanders?

06:15.040 --> 06:18.191
We divorced shortly before
Charlie was even born.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.511
- He works overseas.
- He doesn't even send child support.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.354
You mind if I ask how you
afford this nice neighbourhood?

06:25.440 --> 06:26.998
Mm.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.756
Child Services wouldn't allow a
single mother to foster if she worked.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.913
I live off the proceeds of a generous
trust fund my parents set up long ago.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.949
On the day that Charlie disappeared,
all three boys went to the park?

06:41.040 --> 06:44.589
It's a very safe neighbourhood.
They walk farther to schooI.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.638
We all keep an eye out
for each other around here.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.188
People are good neighbours,
take an interest.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.590
<i>- Mom?
- In here, Skyler. This is my son, Skyler.</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:56.399
Dad told me to bring them
back. We gotta go on ajob.

06:56.480 --> 07:01.349
<i>- There's nothing to do here.
- Our video game's broke.</i>

07:01.440 --> 07:06.468
Shawn, David, this is Agent Booth. He's
gonna find out what happened to Charlie.

07:06.560 --> 07:12.032
- How are you gonna figure it out?
- Oh, I'm in the FBI. We always figure it out.

07:12.120 --> 07:18.070
Boys, if it's all right with your mother,
maybe I could help you out with your video game.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.554
These are invitations to a banquet.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.200
You called a meeting
to invite us to a party?

07:31.280 --> 07:35.990
Don't think of it as an invitation.
Consider it a summons. It's for donors.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.958
Meet and greet, press
the flesh, butt-kiss.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.510
I don't like it any more than you
do. These people fund our research

07:42.600 --> 07:46.559
and all they want in return is to rub
elbows with a scientist once in a while.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.756
- Can't make it.
- Yeah, me neither.

07:48.840 --> 07:53.038
- I have a date that night.
- You don't even know when it is.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.996
- Yes, Mr Addy.
- What kind of food will there be?

07:57.080 --> 08:01.073
When I said, "Think of this as a
summons," I understated. It's a subpoena.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.152
A grand jury subpoena.
Ignore it at your own periI.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.596
- You're not gonna fire us if we don't go.
- No, not fire you.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.275
But I can move your parking spot
to lot M. Enjoy the shuttle ride.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.239
- The shuttle smells like feet.
- I know when I'm beat. I'm in.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.471
- What the hell? It's a party.
- Do I have to wear a tie?

08:18.560 --> 08:21.199
FormaI wear. I've arranged
for a limo to pick us up.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.397
Not me. I'm not afraid
of parking or feet.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.153
You drive me to work.
Don'tjust think of yourself.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.596
Repercussions and consequences,
Dr Hodgins. I'm your boss.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.477
And you will go to this banquet.

08:40.120 --> 08:45.035
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Yeah. I can fix anything. CooI.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.998
You guys, uh... you have girlfriends?

08:48.080 --> 08:50.150
- I do.
- Her name's Leila.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.313
- Leila. Leila.
- I thought you were gonna ask about Charlie.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.154
Yeah, so which one of you puny
mortals wants to challenge me first?

08:58.240 --> 09:00.470
<i>Oh, me!</i>

09:08.000 --> 09:12.676
- You about to clean the bones?
- Yes. I'm warming up the boiler now.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.033
Something wrong?

09:16.120 --> 09:19.112
These are the smallest
remains I've ever worked on.

09:19.200 --> 09:24.069
That's a valid observation, Zack, but
it's not helpfuI to the investigation.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.152
Sorry, Dr Brennan.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.830
I was at Waco. Branch Davidian compound.

09:32.360 --> 09:37.514
I helped identify children who
had been killed in the fire.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.591
17 of them.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.989
So you're saying I'll get used to it?

09:42.080 --> 09:47.074
No. I'm saying you'll never get used
to it. We're primates, sociaI creatures.

09:47.160 --> 09:51.472
It's coded into our DNA to protect
our young, even from each other.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.835
So I'm always going to feeI terrible?

09:53.920 --> 09:57.595
What helps me is to
pull back emotionally.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.877
Just put your heart in a box.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.309
I am not good with metaphor, Dr Brennan.

10:07.320 --> 10:12.075
- Focus on the details.
- Details, yeah. I can do that.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.037
No trauma to the skull.

10:14.120 --> 10:18.830
No compound fractures. Charlie was
not beaten to death or dismembered.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.799
It helps not to refer
to the victim by name.

10:22.880 --> 10:28.113
Greenstick fractures on ribs
four, five, six and seven,

10:28.200 --> 10:31.988
and the sternum is snapped transversely
from the tip to the xiphoid.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.672
What does that indicate?

10:33.760 --> 10:36.752
The victim's chest was struck
by a heavy, blunt object.

10:36.840 --> 10:41.197
Are you certain we've learned everything
we can from the body at this stage?

10:41.280 --> 10:44.397
I've been over everything
at least three times.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.596
Smell the mouth.

10:50.080 --> 10:54.232
Anything behind the typicaI
smells of decomposition?

10:54.320 --> 10:58.836
Some kind of chemicaI? Something
used to render the boy unconscious.

10:58.920 --> 11:05.234
Take samples from the mouth, jaw,
sinuses, and what's left of the oesophagus.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.959
Kids make it harder, Zack.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.273
<i>- All right, you beat me bad.
- No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.</i>

11:19.360 --> 11:21.999
- David!
- It's OK, Mrs Sanders. It's all right.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.992
- No, I do have a girlfriend.
- Is she pretty?

11:25.080 --> 11:27.275
Nah. She's butt ugly.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.636
<i>Got a glass eye, snaggly back teeth.</i>

11:30.720 --> 11:33.792
So, was Leila with you the
day that Charlie disappeared?

11:33.880 --> 11:37.839
Uh, yeah, actually. We stopped and
played some video games at the arcade.

11:37.920 --> 11:43.233
- Before you and Charlie went to the park.
- You didn't go to the mall that day, David.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.832
Shawn?

11:48.120 --> 11:51.749
- Don't ask Shawn, Mom.
- You met Leila at the mall, didn't you?

11:52.720 --> 11:55.712
You left Charlie with Shawn at the park.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.832
Just for a few minutes and
then they came back to the mall.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.480
- David!
- Shawn let go of his hand for a second.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.596
Charlie was gone like that.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.831
And then we came straight home.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.595
Charlie wasn't taken from the
park, he was snatched from the mall.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.955
We've been looking in the wrong place.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.952
<i>Come on, son. Let's go.</i>

12:29.400 --> 12:31.914
What's with the rubber band?

12:32.000 --> 12:37.996
MethyI oxide vapour will bind to whatever
Charlie breathed in before he was killed.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.038
- Ouch!
- It's an anger management technique, right?

12:42.120 --> 12:47.319
The key there is management, which
is what I'm doing. Managing my anger.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.154
There'll be a colour change. Red
for chalcogens and blue for halogens.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.231
I get that you're a little off kilter.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.835
Mad at the government,
conspiracy of dunces, all that.

12:56.920 --> 13:01.869
Furious you've had to mount a boy's jawbone
inside a box to find out what killed him.

13:01.960 --> 13:07.318
What I don't get is why going
to a banquet makes you angry.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.597
Halogens it is. I'm gonna
scrape off the particles

13:10.680 --> 13:14.195
and see if the mass spectrometer
can identify what type of halogen.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.158
Anger is only fear turned inwards.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.394
There are 20 surveillance cameras taking
stills every two seconds throughout the mall.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.517
I concentrated on the ones
aimed at the public concourse.

13:35.600 --> 13:39.070
10,000 people a day go through
that mall. How will we find one kid?

13:39.160 --> 13:43.836
Angela designed a mass recognition program
to apply body types to skeletaI remains.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.275
Endomorph, ectomorph,
that sort of thing.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.079
I modified it to scan
two-dimensionaI images.

13:49.160 --> 13:54.598
We're looking for body masses roughly
congruent with Charlie, Shawn and David.

13:54.680 --> 13:58.673
- There's David.
- You're actually one of them, aren't you?

13:58.760 --> 14:01.354
- One of who?
- A squint. I mean, you look normaI

14:01.440 --> 14:04.273
and you act normaI but
you're actually one of them.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.989
This whole mass recognition
program was Brennan's idea.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.355
I'm completely normaI, really.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.876
Yeah, maybe before you
got this job, but now...

14:14.680 --> 14:16.910
I see Charlie.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.475
Oh. That's him, all right.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.755
<i>Oh, God.</i>

14:22.840 --> 14:25.400
Ange? Are you OK?

14:25.480 --> 14:30.634
These are probably the last
pictures of this little guy alive.

14:32.920 --> 14:36.708
Why is he alone? Why
isn't anybody with him?

14:37.880 --> 14:41.919
Sorry. Max resolution is 640
by 480 pixels per square inch.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.675
He's not alone. Someone's calling
him over. Can't you just zoom in?

14:45.760 --> 14:50.993
The fewer pixels that make up an image, the
more the picture degrades once we zoom in.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.469
Did that sound too squinty?

14:53.560 --> 14:57.348
- Any way to enhance it?
- I wouldn't bet a date with Colin Farrell on it.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.750
- I know him. He's funny.
- Funny is Will Ferrell, sweetie.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.751
Hot is Colin Farrell.

15:02.840 --> 15:07.516
The kid was definitely moving toward
someone. He wasn't trying to get away.

15:07.600 --> 15:11.991
I want to add the neighbourhood kid,
Skyler, to the list of possible suspects.

15:12.080 --> 15:16.949
I have one other angle but our
bad guy's still obstructed in it.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.157
Who the hell are you?

15:34.320 --> 15:37.790
Are you thinking of
leaving the Jeffersonian?

15:38.800 --> 15:40.836
I'm not really this person.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.597
- What person?
- I'm not like you.

15:45.040 --> 15:49.750
I'm not driven by the need
forjustice and all that.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.354
I'm a good-time girI.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.351
We have good times.

15:54.440 --> 15:59.116
Cracking jokes over murdered
skeletons is not good times.

15:59.200 --> 16:04.274
- It's harder on you than it is for the rest of us.
- No, it's not.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.949
Why?

16:08.040 --> 16:10.031
Because you look at their faces.

16:10.120 --> 16:13.192
We look at everything else.
It's more clinicaI for us.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.670
For you... it's personaI.

16:16.760 --> 16:21.880
- When we see a murdered child...
- Honey, I... I'm... No offence.

16:21.960 --> 16:27.114
I'm really not up for one of your "it
takes a village" anthropology lessons.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.677
This is the longest I've ever had ajob.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.955
That's because of you.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.710
If this is about hours or time
to do your own art, then...

16:37.800 --> 16:40.360
Just let me work on it, OK?

16:41.320 --> 16:45.233
I'm an artist. I used
to draw naked guys.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.110
Now I draw dead guys.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.473
Just don't decide anything
without talking to me.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.710
Of course I won't.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.669
- Angela might quit.
- I'm amazed she's stuck it out this long.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.672
- Why?
- Oh, because she's human.

17:17.760 --> 17:22.196
I'm sorry, Bones. It's just that, you know,
uh, Angela didn't get the same training

17:22.280 --> 17:25.317
that the rest of you
got on Planet Vulcan.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.709
- I don't know what that means.
- She's sensitive.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.631
- Who's sensitive?
- Angela.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.952
She likes puppies, and kitties,
and ducklings, and Jell-O shots,

17:34.040 --> 17:36.952
<i>and, you know, dancing on bars.</i>

17:37.400 --> 17:41.996
I know that. She's my best friend. Angela's
not the only person who likes baby animals.

17:42.080 --> 17:46.676
- I never got the big attraction.
- I rest my case. She's more sensitive.

17:46.760 --> 17:51.231
We cross-referenced the length and density
of Charlie's legs with children his age.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.914
The victim, I mean.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.479
The thing to do is
concentrate on the details.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.992
- Let's do that.
- We found some abnormalities.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.310
They're bowed and abnormally short.

18:07.400 --> 18:11.712
- The bones show freezing of the joints.
- Are you saying Charlie was crippled?

18:11.800 --> 18:15.952
- The victim was disabled, yes.
- His mother never mentioned that.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.749
The ribs are broken in two places,
not typicaI of blunt-force trauma.

18:19.840 --> 18:24.868
- How do you explain that?
- I attribute it to his medicaI condition.

18:24.960 --> 18:31.149
- I agree. What is that condition?
- It looks like scoliosis, a bend in the spine.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.191
I think it's more than that, Zack.

18:36.280 --> 18:40.319
There are multiple calcified lesions
on the posterior thoracic vertebrae.

18:40.400 --> 18:46.111
That, plus Charlie's short stature,
and the asymmetric length of his legs...

18:46.200 --> 18:49.715
Margaret Sanders may not be
Charlie's biologicaI mother.

18:49.800 --> 18:50.949
What?

18:51.040 --> 18:53.998
Test the bones for
X-linked hypophosphataemia

18:54.080 --> 18:55.911
and Coffin-Lowry Syndrome.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.911
Whoa, whoa. OK, hold on.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.231
Simmer down. Back up to the
part where she's not his mother.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.551
Dr Brennan is having me check
for hereditary genetic defects

19:04.640 --> 19:06.676
which are passed from mother to child.

19:06.760 --> 19:11.709
If Charlie had one, then Margaret
Sanders is not his mother.

19:17.320 --> 19:22.872
- How can you say that?
- Charlie suffered from hypophosphataemia.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.838
- Charlie's reaI mother would have it.
- You do not.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.434
Never say I wasn't
Charlie's reaI mother. I was.

19:28.520 --> 19:34.231
BiologicaI mother, then. Mrs Sanders,
you are not Charlie's biologicaI mother.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.550
You want to explain that to us?

19:38.320 --> 19:42.757
I can't have children.
That's why my husband left me.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.310
- So I took in foster kids.
- Like Shawn and David Cook.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.391
And Charlie.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.550
Though his name was Nathan.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.870
I got him as a baby down in Pittsburgh.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.951
Ten days old.

19:57.240 --> 20:02.951
His mother was arrested on drug charges
and Child Services brought him to me.

20:03.040 --> 20:07.477
Three weeks I had him. Then
the charges were dropped.

20:07.560 --> 20:10.074
- You kept him?
- No.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.994
I gave him back, but
it nearly killed me.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.515
I stayed in touch.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.432
I bought him things. Formula, stroller.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.232
I wanted to make sure he was all right.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.118
Nathan what, Mrs Sanders?

20:29.360 --> 20:31.396
Nathan Downey.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.677
His mother was a drug
addict named Jeanine.

20:35.680 --> 20:40.037
On Christmas Day, I found her dead on the
kitchen floor, a needle stuck in her arm,

20:40.120 --> 20:43.430
and I could hear
Charlie crying upstairs.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.318
- So I went up.
- And you took him home.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.437
I looked him in the
eyes and I promised him

20:49.520 --> 20:53.115
I would never leave him alone again.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.475
And he stopped crying.

20:55.560 --> 20:59.314
I expected every day for
Child Services to come looking.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.678
He would have ended up
back in the system anyway.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.910
<i>I meant to keep him safe...</i>

21:08.000 --> 21:10.719
and love him.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.439
And now he's dead.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.392
- I had to arrest her.
- The story checked out.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.072
She confessed to kidnapping.

21:23.160 --> 21:28.439
Margaret responded to the anthropologicaI
imperative. She saw an orphan and reacted.

21:28.520 --> 21:32.354
<i>This is not a National Geographic
study, OK? This is the suburbs.</i>

21:32.440 --> 21:38.151
- Why would she kill the boy? She loved him.
- The kid gets sick, he's not what you wanted.

21:38.240 --> 21:43.951
I bet you could give me a dozen examples of
societies that have killed their own young.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.076
What about Shawn and David Cook?

21:46.160 --> 21:48.515
- Where do they go now?
- Back into the system.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.398
Do you have any idea how bad
the foster-care system is?

21:51.480 --> 21:53.516
Do you? What do you want to do, hm?

21:53.600 --> 21:56.353
Do you want to kidnap them
like she kidnapped Charlie?

21:56.440 --> 22:00.149
I want you to let them go
home to Margaret Sanders.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.435
It's not gonna happen.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.149
- Try redigitising and resizing.
- I did.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.357
The extrapolation protocoI
got confused by the spread.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.749
You know Hodgins better
than anybody else.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.752
So, why is he so bent out
of shape about this banquet?

22:18.840 --> 22:21.638
- What makes you say that?
- When someone mentions it

22:21.720 --> 22:24.359
he snaps that rubber
band around his wrist.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.591
What makes you think I know
Hodgins better than anyone else?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.240
- You're roommates.
- I live above his garage.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.276
- But you see a lot of each other.
- No.

22:32.360 --> 22:36.035
- He drives you to work.
- I've never been up to the main house.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.793
- The main house?
- It's at the end of the driveway

22:38.880 --> 22:41.394
on the other side of the tennis courts.

22:41.480 --> 22:44.517
OK. Anything on the identity
of Charlie's abductor?

22:44.600 --> 22:49.720
I can't clear up this image. Tell Booth what
you told me about living in Hodgins' garage.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.634
There's a bedroom, living room,
kitchen, another bedroom, a den...

22:53.720 --> 22:57.633
- Quite a garage. Can we focus on the case?
- How many cars does he have?

22:57.720 --> 23:01.508
Including the antique
ones, about 12. And a boat.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.479
Zack has never seen the main house.
The tennis courts block the view.

23:05.560 --> 23:09.348
<i>- Well, he must be one of those Hodgins.
- Who are those Hodgins?</i>

23:09.440 --> 23:13.479
- You know, the Cantilever Group Hodgins.
- Oh, my God.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.472
The Cantilever Group
generates more GNP than Europe.

23:16.560 --> 23:20.712
Get this. They are the single biggest
donors to the Jeffersonian Institution.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.395
<i>Ha! That makes Hodgins your boss.</i>

23:26.560 --> 23:29.313
What do you talk about
when he drives you to work?

23:29.400 --> 23:32.915
I mostly sleep. Hodgins
mostly yells at the radio.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.151
If you can't see the face,
maybe you can grab a reflection.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.038
- That's a workable idea.
- Well, I'd say thanks,

23:39.120 --> 23:43.238
you know, if you didn't say it
like it was some kind of a miracle.

23:47.600 --> 23:53.311
Chem lab mass spectrometer identifies the
particulates in Charlie's mouth as fluoride.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.755
- I recognise that look.
- What?

23:55.840 --> 24:00.789
You're writing another book. When you write
you look like you stuck a fork in a toaster.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.429
- Am I in this one, too?
- Fluoride? At what concentration?

24:04.520 --> 24:07.557
- It's too high for toothpaste.
- Put together a list of...

24:07.640 --> 24:11.599
Put together a list of anything that
contains fluoride at those levels.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.716
All right. Do you have time for this?

24:13.800 --> 24:16.360
- They gave me a car.
- Nice. Who?

24:16.440 --> 24:19.910
My publisher. I feeI like I have
to earn it by writing another book.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.348
Fight coercion in all its forms. You don't write
the book. I don't go to the banquet. Solidarity.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.235
Angela has a face for the abductor.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.591
I looked on both cameras. This one
offered up more reflective surfaces.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.113
Right at the door.

24:43.200 --> 24:47.034
<i>- Check this out.
- The abductor's face.</i>

24:47.120 --> 24:51.511
The computer can interpret the spaces
between the white and the dark gaps

24:51.600 --> 24:53.875
and fill in the missing pieces.

24:53.960 --> 24:59.830
- Wait. That doesn't look like an adult.
- I already polarised the image.

25:02.560 --> 25:06.235
- Shawn Cook.
- The victim's foster brother.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.514
<i>- Where were you taking Charlie?
- I brought him to the mall.</i>

25:15.600 --> 25:20.549
I know you brought him to the
mall, but we got a picture of you...

25:20.640 --> 25:23.234
leading him out of the mall.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.435
- Have you seen much of this?
- I'm ajuvenile prosecutor.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.398
I wish I could say kids
killing kids was rare.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.633
<i>Where were you taking him, Shawn?</i>

25:35.720 --> 25:39.554
- When can I talk to Margaret?
- After you answer my questions.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.279
Can he do that? Lie to a kid?

25:42.360 --> 25:44.590
We're after a child killer, Dr Brennan.

25:44.680 --> 25:48.275
If the child advocate in there
doesn't complain, I sure won't.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.670
Well, what's the point if he
doesn't advocate for the child?

25:51.760 --> 25:55.673
I get the impression you're a little
confused as to what side you're on.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.873
Shawn.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.148
- You know what that is?
- A scar?

26:01.240 --> 26:02.389
Yeah.

26:02.480 --> 26:06.473
Got it when I was playing
soldier with my brother Jared.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.597
- Did it hurt?
- Yeah, it hurt.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.591
But it was an accident.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.875
You got any scars?

26:18.080 --> 26:20.150
My dad did it with a cigarette.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.793
He shouldn't have done that.

26:24.760 --> 26:29.709
Margaret didn't do anything
like that. I love Margaret.

26:29.800 --> 26:34.828
What I need to know is if Charlie
had some kind of an accident.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.079
Shawn?

26:38.160 --> 26:40.390
Maybe we can just take a break.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.629
Shawn.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.917
- He's not aggressive enough.
- Foster kids are powerless.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.597
They're treated like garbage, and all you
have to say is, "He's not aggressive enough"?

26:50.680 --> 26:56.869
Dr Brennan, you know this boy may very well
have beaten a child to death with a rock?

27:10.920 --> 27:15.994
- How long have we known each other?
- Do people really ever know each other?

27:16.080 --> 27:18.719
How come you never invited
me over to your house?

27:18.800 --> 27:23.510
- Oh, I didn't pick up that kind of vibe off you.
- I thought we were close, all of us.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.353
What else don't I know? Is
Zack from another planet?

27:26.440 --> 27:28.715
Oh, come on. That one's obvious.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.917
You're rich.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.117
You single-handedly own
the Cantilever Group.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.589
Don't deny it. I know.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.356
- Who else knows?
- Zack.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.793
Booth.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.155
Don't tell Brennan.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.879
Why don't you want us to
know that you're our boss?

27:46.960 --> 27:52.557
I don't want to be anybody's boss.
I never did. Please respect that.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.549
- What's up with Angela?
- It's job pressure.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.516
Fluoride at lower concentrations
is used in toothpaste, tea,

28:05.600 --> 28:09.912
and is added to our water, which can cause
a range of conditions. Brain damage...

28:10.000 --> 28:14.152
Which has nothing to do
with the case at hand.

28:14.840 --> 28:18.992
The concentrations found in our victim
might come from paint thinners, car wax,

28:19.080 --> 28:21.833
- or various other industriaI products.
- OK.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.480
Did Angela say anything
about quitting herjob?

28:24.560 --> 28:26.551
No.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.916
But we hardly know
anything about each other.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.314
Bones.

28:40.400 --> 28:46.032
I thought you'd like to know that
Shawn and David are in emergency care.

28:46.120 --> 28:51.240
Pulled some strings, you know, to
make sure they get to stay together.

28:51.320 --> 28:54.312
- That's good. Thanks.
- It's the best I could do.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.029
- Yeah, I understand.
- No, you say you understand but you don't.

28:58.120 --> 29:03.877
Not really. I mean, if you don't like the
rule you ignore it, right? I can't have that.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.269
- And if you want to do this...
- Do what?

29:06.360 --> 29:09.477
Work on cases, you know,
with me, outside the lab.

29:09.560 --> 29:13.269
If you want to do that, I need to
know that you will respect the law.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.717
Tell you what. If I can't respect
the law, I can at least respect you.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.758
<i>Oh.</i>

29:20.840 --> 29:23.912
Yeah, that'll work. It kinda
comes outta nowhere, but...

29:24.000 --> 29:26.798
<i>Look what you did.</i>

29:26.880 --> 29:29.189
It's a penciI. I'll get you a new one.

29:29.280 --> 29:32.033
The victim was killed
by trauma to the chest

29:32.120 --> 29:35.157
but the ribs are broken
in two places, notjust one.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.676
Because of the, uh... the brittle
bones, because of his disease.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.796
But there's another explanation.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.917
- Whoa. What's the other explanation?
- Compression.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.956
- Charlie was crushed to death?
- Yes.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.032
Greenstick fractures,
vertebraI and sternaI. See?

29:49.120 --> 29:53.113
Shawn outweighed Charlie by 30Ibs.
How could he have crushed him to death?

29:53.200 --> 29:56.158
We need to run some scenarios
through the Angelator.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.231
- Angela.
- Booth.

29:59.480 --> 30:04.429
Zack has been informed that if he tells anyone
who I am, I will kick him out on the street.

30:04.520 --> 30:08.115
- There's nothing I can threaten you two with.
- Yeah, that's a shame.

30:08.200 --> 30:12.591
What I want out of my life is to come
in here and sift through slime and bugs.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.513
My family is one of those
who secretly run the world.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.798
Paranoia and delusions of
grandeur all in one package.

30:19.880 --> 30:25.876
You call it paranoia, I call it the family
business. Please, could you just stop?

30:26.720 --> 30:29.029
The reason I do not want
to go to that banquet

30:29.120 --> 30:33.636
is because the other members of the ruling
elite will make a big fuss about seeing me.

30:33.720 --> 30:39.272
My secret will be out and my life,
this life that I love, will be ruined.

30:39.720 --> 30:45.875
I'm asking you, please, please just let
me be Jack Hodgins who works in the lab.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.788
Charlie was 3'4" tall and weighed 58Ibs.

30:56.880 --> 31:01.476
- And Shawn?
- Shawn Cook is 1.4m tall and weighs 31kg.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.518
His brother David was 5'8, 150Ibs.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.512
1.75m, 68kg.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.229
I thought the break to Charlie's
sternum was caused by blunt trauma

31:11.320 --> 31:15.029
because it only ran along one fault
line. When Booth broke my penciI,

31:15.120 --> 31:19.079
I realised there's another way to
cause the same injury. Compression.

31:19.160 --> 31:22.232
Hodgins found no particulates
that suggested crushing.

31:22.320 --> 31:27.758
Body weight. There has to be enough weight on
the victim so no air can get into the lungs.

31:27.840 --> 31:32.960
Prolonged pressure caused the sternum
to snap in half and the ribs to break.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.508
Oh, my God.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.149
Sorry. Sorry.

31:42.600 --> 31:46.149
I entered reaI-world variables
taking into account Charlie's size

31:46.240 --> 31:51.758
and the pressure that was required to break
Charlie's sternum in the way it was broken.

31:51.840 --> 31:55.230
- What did you end up with?
- 86.2kg.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.834
- What's that in American?
- 190Ibs.

32:00.720 --> 32:04.030
Way too much for either of the
Cook kids or Margaret Sanders.

32:04.120 --> 32:07.874
I'd put the neighbourhood
kid, Skyler, at about 160Ibs.

32:07.960 --> 32:12.829
- It can't be him, either. - We
should be looking for a full-grown man.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.799
Get Shawn to tell you where he took
Charlie when they left the mall.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.235
He won't talk to me.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.038
- Let me do it.
- Oh, no.

32:21.120 --> 32:24.112
You know, people are not
your strong point, Bones,

32:24.200 --> 32:27.875
and, besides, he's not gonna care how
many facts you put in front of him.

32:27.960 --> 32:31.873
Could you just go with me on this one,
Booth? We're trying to catch a killer.

32:31.960 --> 32:35.839
- Let me help.
- When's the last time you talked to a kid?

32:35.920 --> 32:38.115
I know what to say.

32:39.680 --> 32:45.277
<i>- Do you remember me, Shawn?
- The museum lady. The one who's so smart.</i>

32:45.360 --> 32:47.191
<i>Y eah, I'm pretty smart.</i>

32:47.280 --> 32:51.273
- And very modest.
- Oh, believe me, she is being modest.

32:51.360 --> 32:55.239
Smart enough to know that
you didn't kill Charlie.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.118
You don't have to say anything, Shawn.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.191
Just listen.

33:01.640 --> 33:06.430
They give you a garbage
bag to carry all your stuff,

33:06.520 --> 33:09.717
like they're telling you
everything you own is garbage.

33:09.800 --> 33:15.352
And then you have to go to a new schooI
in clothes that smell like garbage bags.

33:15.440 --> 33:19.228
All the regular kids
know you're a foster kid.

33:22.120 --> 33:24.680
How do you know what it's like?

33:24.760 --> 33:27.832
They bounce you from place to place

33:27.920 --> 33:30.434
and it's never home.

33:31.320 --> 33:34.596
Sometimes the foster parents are nice.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.870
- Like Margaret?
- Yeah.

33:37.960 --> 33:42.511
And sometimes they separate
you from your brother.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.114
It must have been nice with Margaret,

33:45.200 --> 33:47.191
staying with David.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.835
We got bunk beds.

33:52.920 --> 33:56.196
At night, I knew David was there,

33:56.280 --> 33:59.352
like he was guarding me.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.635
Margaret's nice.

34:02.920 --> 34:07.277
You'd do almost anything to
stay with Margaret, right?

34:08.280 --> 34:12.431
The man you took Charlie
to, the man who hurt him,

34:12.520 --> 34:14.511
he knows that.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.239
You didn't know that he'd
hurt Charlie, but he did,

34:17.320 --> 34:21.359
and then he told you that Margaret
would blame you, that she'd hate you.

34:21.440 --> 34:25.717
But this man is Iying to you, Shawn. I
can make sure that you go back to Margaret.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.349
How? You work at a museum.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.318
I have a friend at the FBI.

34:32.400 --> 34:36.313
He will make sure that you and David
get to live with Margaret again.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.630
- You can't make promises like that.
- Yes, I can.

34:39.719 --> 34:43.315
- He will do it. My friend will make it happen.
- Oh, man.

34:43.400 --> 34:47.393
But you have to tell
me who hurt Charlie.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.630
I'll need your help to keep the
promises she made to that boy.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.949
- Hey, I-I can't
promise... - Mrs Johnson.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.873
My people and your people are
gonna have to make this happen.

34:56.960 --> 35:00.794
What if Margaret
doesn't want me any more?

35:00.880 --> 35:03.030
Charlie was her reaI son.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.918
Charlie wasn't her
biologicaI son either.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.279
Charlie was just like you, someone
that Margaret chose to love.

35:13.880 --> 35:18.635
I don't think we should let that man take
you and David and Charlie away from Margaret,

35:18.720 --> 35:21.280
do you?

35:21.360 --> 35:24.796
We should stop him. You
and I should stop him.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.033
She did it. She got his name.

36:04.040 --> 36:09.637
Edward Nelson, you are under arrest for the
sexuaI assault and murder of Charlie Sanders.

36:09.720 --> 36:15.113
You have the right to an attorney. If you
cannot afford one, one will be appointed.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.073
- Boys!
- Mom!

37:21.160 --> 37:23.515
Mom!

37:23.600 --> 37:27.798
<i>- Are we gonna be a family again?
- Oh, you betcha.</i>

37:38.280 --> 37:39.793
<i>We have him cold.</i>

37:39.880 --> 37:44.431
The insecticide he was using on the
termites matches the fluoride concentration.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.590
Skyler's dad admitted everything.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.797
He said crushing Charlie
to death was a mistake?

37:49.880 --> 37:54.556
He never abused Shawn. He just used him to
get near Charlie. It played out like you said.

37:54.640 --> 37:58.349
He had Charlie out in that field.
Some teenage kids, they come by.

37:58.440 --> 38:02.956
So he knelt on Charlie to keep him from
crying out. Shawn ran back to his brother.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.191
Charlie was small and
weak, his sternum collapsed.

38:06.280 --> 38:09.352
- You think he abused any other kids?
- Yeah.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.590
Probably his own son.

38:11.680 --> 38:17.869
- You report that to Child Services?
- Mm-hm. Try to get the kid some help.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.714
- And I'm sorry.
- For what?

38:22.160 --> 38:25.596
You have personaI
experience in the system.

38:30.640 --> 38:34.838
I was a foster child untiI
my grandfather got me out.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.878
When you said, "They'd take
you away from your brother,"

38:37.960 --> 38:42.272
I kinda had the feeling you
weren't talking about David Cook.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.078
Booth,

38:44.160 --> 38:48.073
I'll tell you about it one day, but
tonight I have to get dressed for a party.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.390
Oh.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.469
OK, Bones.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.994
There's a huge ding on
my passenger side door

38:54.080 --> 38:56.992
because you told me not
to park it at an angle.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.319
OK, that's just mean.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.599
You're mean.

39:05.160 --> 39:07.151
Sorry.

39:13.720 --> 39:17.269
- That is not a tuxedo, Dr Hodgins.
- I am not going, Dr Goodman.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.590
You are going.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.513
When we arrive, the donors
will be wearing name tags.

39:22.600 --> 39:26.036
- What do we talk about?
- Your work, of course.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.476
Zack's work consists of
removing flesh from corpses.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.757
Hodgins dissects bugs that
have been eating eyeballs.

39:32.840 --> 39:38.119
- Leave me out of it. I am not going.
- And how do you see yourjob?

39:38.200 --> 39:40.191
I draw death masks.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.989
- Is that really how you see it?
- Don't you?

39:44.080 --> 39:46.958
You are the best of us, Miss Montenegro.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.237
You discern humanity in the
wreck of a ruined human body.

39:50.320 --> 39:54.029
You give victims back their
faces, their identities.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.999
You remind us all of why
we're here in the first place.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.639
Because we treasure human life.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.275
- Oh, for God's sake.
- What happened?

40:08.360 --> 40:13.309
AII Angela needed was to hear herjob
description in a deep African-American tone.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.153
- Mr Addy.
- We need Hodgins in the lab tonight.

40:16.240 --> 40:19.550
The FBI needs this analysed by morning.

40:20.240 --> 40:24.153
- Uh, I'm gonna get right on it.
- Wait a minute. What case file is this?

40:24.240 --> 40:28.916
- Am I supposed to know about it?
- Booth mentioned it to me earlier today.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.510
That's good enough for me.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.717
Fine. You're off the hook, Dr Hodgins.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.558
Let's not keep the limo waiting.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.631
Thanks.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.150
You look nice.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.234
Better than nice. You look...

40:54.000 --> 40:56.116
very...

40:57.320 --> 40:59.550
Thanks.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.712
- How did you know I'd keep your promise?
- What promise?

41:02.800 --> 41:05.792
To get Shawn and David
back with Margaret Sanders.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.269
Maybe I was Iying.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.271
To catch the bad guy.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.999
I learned that trick from you.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.116
The end justifies the means.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.071
Hm.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.556
Booth.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.839
I knew you'd back me up.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.829
- I knew you wouldn't make me a liar.
- How'd you know?

41:28.840 --> 41:31.149
Because you want to go to heaven.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.710
- But you don't believe in heaven.
- But you do.

42:06.200 --> 42:09.829
