WEBVTT

00:00.207 --> 00:01.855
<i>Previously on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:01.880 --> 00:04.526
<i>Responding to shots fired
at the Sunrise Cafe.</i>

00:05.464 --> 00:06.964
<i>I shot an innocent man.</i>

00:06.998 --> 00:08.699
You were on foot pursuit, he turned

00:08.733 --> 00:10.000
- and aimed his gun at you.
- Loman!

00:10.936 --> 00:12.403
Are you sure he chased a cop?

00:12.404 --> 00:14.204
A cop who ran away from a massacre.

00:14.239 --> 00:16.573
I'm not starting a war
with the secret police.

00:16.608 --> 00:18.242
You're not crazy. It's all connected.

00:18.276 --> 00:20.277
<i>If you really love me, save me.</i>

00:21.613 --> 00:23.747
Why would you do this to yourself?

00:23.782 --> 00:25.316
Somebody!

00:25.350 --> 00:26.617
She's an escort.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.218
Stahl calls her Harley.

00:28.253 --> 00:29.586
- Tell me what happened.
- I saw him.

00:29.621 --> 00:31.322
- Saw who?
- Stahl.

00:31.356 --> 00:32.790
Last contact was north
of the Mexican border.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.625
And that's where you think he is? Mexico?

00:34.659 --> 00:37.394
Is it possible you're using
Stahl as a distraction?

00:37.429 --> 00:39.430
Distraction from the fact
the intelligence unit

00:39.464 --> 00:41.165
<i>killed the only decent man
that I ever loved,</i>

00:41.199 --> 00:42.666
or that you helped cover their tracks?

00:42.701 --> 00:44.268
You know, Nate started asking questions

00:44.302 --> 00:46.270
about Nava's murder.
That thread could unravel

00:46.304 --> 00:48.105
Harlee's bad shoot at the Sunrise.

00:48.139 --> 00:51.342
Mr. Molina? Don't contact Nate Wozniak.

00:51.376 --> 00:54.845
<i>Why would I want to be
touched by some hipster fairy?</i>

00:54.879 --> 00:56.280
Let me go!

00:56.314 --> 00:58.916
You're dead.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.317
Did you ever really see Stahl?

01:00.352 --> 01:01.919
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- But you're not sure.

01:01.953 --> 01:03.153
Thought I was.

<i>Somebody!</i>

02:04.549 --> 02:07.251
<i>- 911. What's your emergency?
- A woman.</i>

02:07.285 --> 02:09.520
She's bleeding.
She cut her wrist wide open.

02:09.554 --> 02:10.721
<i>Can you tell me where you are?</i>

02:10.755 --> 02:14.358
<i>872 Deerfield Road.</i>

02:14.392 --> 02:16.693
<i>Hurry up. She's losing a lot of blood.</i>

02:36.781 --> 02:38.715
Ah... ah!

05:01.559 --> 05:06.663
<i>People. Well, people fascinate me.</i>

05:06.698 --> 05:09.566
<i>I used to observe
human behavior for a living,</i>

05:09.601 --> 05:11.401
<i>and I can tell you just about
everyone walking around</i>

05:11.436 --> 05:12.703
<i>out there doesn't have
the first damn clue</i>

05:12.737 --> 05:14.705
<i>as to what motivates them.</i>

05:14.739 --> 05:17.774
<i>And, you know, I used to feel
sorry for the poor bastards.</i>

05:17.809 --> 05:20.911
<i>They'd hit rock bottom without
seeing 100 different things</i>

05:20.945 --> 05:22.546
<i>they could have done differently,</i>

05:22.580 --> 05:23.747
<i>or if they could,</i>

05:23.781 --> 05:26.183
<i>they were simply unable
to control the impulses</i>

05:26.217 --> 05:30.587
<i>that sunk them... greed, ego, pride...</i>

05:30.622 --> 05:33.924
<i>love... a woman.</i>

05:33.958 --> 05:35.959
<i>That was my downfall.</i>

05:35.994 --> 05:38.595
<i>But like all tales
of that sweet sickness,</i>

05:38.630 --> 05:42.199
<i>there are two sides
of the story, aren't there?</i>

05:46.804 --> 05:49.072
<i>There's a "she said"...</i>

05:49.107 --> 05:51.508
<i>and a "he said."</i>

05:56.981 --> 06:01.718
Robert... I need to call in that favor.

06:01.753 --> 06:02.786
<i>I knew better.</i>

06:02.820 --> 06:04.655
<i>I knew being with her was impractical.</i>

06:04.689 --> 06:07.100
<i>It was dangerous, even.</i>

06:07.759 --> 06:09.626
<i>Maybe that was part of it.</i>

06:11.963 --> 06:14.731
<i>But once I was hooked... once this siren</i>

06:14.766 --> 06:17.277
<i>lured me into the rocky shore...</i>

06:17.802 --> 06:20.170
<i>she went in for the kill.</i>

06:20.204 --> 06:22.673
<i>She blamed me for things
I had nothing to do with.</i>

06:23.975 --> 06:25.776
<i>She cast me in a light that had</i>

06:25.810 --> 06:27.811
<i>my closest friends doubting me.</i>

06:31.983 --> 06:33.051
It was a mistake.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.584
He wasn't supposed to be part of it.

06:34.619 --> 06:35.852
How would you know that
unless you were there?

06:35.887 --> 06:38.255
I wasn't. I swear.

06:38.289 --> 06:39.323
Who killed Nava?

06:39.357 --> 06:43.593
<i>Worse, I... I let her in my head...</i>

06:43.628 --> 06:45.696
<i>into my wiring.</i>

06:45.730 --> 06:47.964
<i>And once you do that...</i>

06:47.999 --> 06:50.600
<i>you give up control.</i>

06:50.635 --> 06:53.136
<i>The part of you that knows
better is screaming at you</i>

06:53.171 --> 06:54.805
<i>to walk away, but the other part</i>

06:54.839 --> 06:57.207
<i>just can't let it go.</i>

06:57.241 --> 06:58.175
<i>Hello?</i>

07:00.845 --> 07:01.945
<i>Hello?</i>

07:06.818 --> 07:09.619
<i>It's like, uh... gravity.</i>

07:11.022 --> 07:12.756
<i>The pull is too strong.</i>

07:18.996 --> 07:21.164
Hello?

07:21.199 --> 07:23.300
Is there something I can do for you?

07:24.836 --> 07:28.348
<i>Some days I feel my sanity
slowly slipping away...</i>

07:29.207 --> 07:30.640
<i>stolen from me.</i>

07:55.199 --> 07:56.918
No.

07:58.236 --> 08:00.103
- No more.
<i>- And yet,</i>

08:00.138 --> 08:02.939
<i>every time I see her,</i>

08:02.974 --> 08:05.385
<i>I feel the same rush.</i>

08:05.743 --> 08:09.723
that same mixture of nausea and...

08:10.948 --> 08:12.716
joy.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.618
I dated a guy like that once.

08:14.652 --> 08:18.021
Always judging me. Such a trap.

08:18.055 --> 08:19.723
How can you be happy
if you can't just be yourself?

08:19.757 --> 08:22.192
Exactly, exact... see? Now you get it.

08:22.226 --> 08:24.060
But she's underestimated me.

08:24.095 --> 08:26.196
She thought I'd just give up.

08:26.230 --> 08:27.898
Yeah, you don't really seem
like the kind of person

08:27.932 --> 08:29.366
that lets someone walk all over you.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.735
I almost was, but then...

08:31.769 --> 08:33.328
that's why I came back...

08:33.363 --> 08:36.206
to show her that I'm a man
to be respected.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.109
Prove to her that I'm not
the man she thinks.

08:40.778 --> 08:42.913
<i>This one's on the house.</i>

08:44.369 --> 08:47.284
From a fellow member
of the broken hearts club.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.757
- Thanks, doll.
- Yep.

08:53.791 --> 08:55.792
- Hey.
- The usual?

08:55.827 --> 08:56.960
Yeah.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.855
Thanks, Alissa.

09:36.707 --> 09:38.174
Annie?

09:49.610 --> 09:52.516
Dad, what did you do to yourself?

09:55.749 --> 09:59.385
Woz. Are you with me?

10:02.756 --> 10:05.213
You haven't figured that out by now?

10:06.426 --> 10:08.133
Where's your gun?

10:09.730 --> 10:11.397
Under the dumpster.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.423
Easier to fight back
if you don't disarm yourself.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.709
Ow... oh...

10:26.413 --> 10:29.048
That wasn't the point, was it?

10:29.082 --> 10:32.718
I didn't think of an exit strategy.

10:32.753 --> 10:35.334
Come on. Let's go.

10:48.602 --> 10:49.735
Hey.

10:55.509 --> 10:57.810
Yep, yep, "The Economist."

10:57.844 --> 10:59.912
It's a thinker's read.

10:59.947 --> 11:02.748
Speaks to a man who makes his own future.

11:02.783 --> 11:04.417
- Yeah.
- Or I just like

11:04.451 --> 11:06.586
to stay informed.

11:06.620 --> 11:07.987
Oh, wait a minute, I remember...

11:08.021 --> 11:09.655
hey, I saw you at Gracie's Tavern

11:09.690 --> 11:11.613
the other night, didn't I?

11:12.192 --> 11:14.827
I didn't see you. No offense.

11:14.861 --> 11:16.618
None taken.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.565
Thought a cop that works
the Intelligence Unit

11:19.600 --> 11:21.467
might be a little more attentive, but...

11:24.705 --> 11:26.606
Can I help you with something, friend?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.674
Well, if there's anything
you do want to share,

11:28.709 --> 11:30.610
it'll stay between you
and Internal Affairs.

11:30.644 --> 11:33.746
You want dirt... dig elsewhere.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.529
Preferably about six feet down,

11:35.563 --> 11:36.916
then jump in. I'll do the rest.

11:36.950 --> 11:39.085
Hey, look. If I wanted dirt,

11:39.119 --> 11:41.020
I'd just drop by the sixth floor.

11:41.054 --> 11:43.155
The detectives there love
to play in the mud,

11:43.190 --> 11:45.230
staining anybody nearby.

11:46.827 --> 11:49.528
Now's not the time to make new friends.

11:49.563 --> 11:51.163
Cristina.

11:51.198 --> 11:52.698
You forgot this.

11:52.733 --> 11:54.500
I don't have physics today.

11:54.534 --> 11:55.768
Don't you have lab on Tuesdays?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.803
It's next quarter. You know that.

11:57.838 --> 11:59.494
If you wanted another hug,
you just had to ask.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.608
I'm so sorry, baby.

12:02.643 --> 12:04.143
I shouldn't have put all that on you.

12:04.177 --> 12:06.278
Mom, you've apologized
like a million times.

12:06.313 --> 12:08.948
But you shouldn't have had
to see me like that.

12:08.982 --> 12:11.851
Look, I want you to know...
I'm putting Stahl

12:11.885 --> 12:15.855
and that whole nightmare
in the past, where it belongs.

12:15.889 --> 12:17.857
Trust me, I'm fine
returning to my bubble.

12:17.891 --> 12:19.291
It's much less stressful.

12:21.695 --> 12:22.695
Mom.

12:24.264 --> 12:25.854
I mean it.

12:26.733 --> 12:28.834
I won't let Stahl in my head again.

12:28.869 --> 12:30.536
Good.

12:30.570 --> 12:32.238
I'm gonna be late. I love you.

12:32.272 --> 12:33.639
I love you too, sweetie.

12:47.187 --> 12:48.988
My house? Seriously?

12:49.022 --> 12:50.990
Late for your Internal Affairs meeting?

12:51.024 --> 12:52.242
I passed last week.

12:52.276 --> 12:54.527
Standard procedure
for lethal use of force.

12:54.561 --> 12:55.995
Did you tell them anything about me?

12:56.029 --> 12:58.764
You think I survived
ten years by blabbing to IA?

12:58.799 --> 13:00.232
Well, I just got warned off
talking to you

13:00.267 --> 13:02.034
by an IAB officer.

13:02.069 --> 13:03.602
And he got you so rattled
you came running to me?

13:03.637 --> 13:06.939
My boss has friends in Internal Affairs!

13:06.973 --> 13:08.741
Which has friends everywhere.

13:08.775 --> 13:12.611
He's probably fishing,
or sending you a message.

13:12.646 --> 13:14.180
Do you want me to check for a leak?

13:14.214 --> 13:15.548
I want you to tell me if they know

13:15.582 --> 13:17.683
we've exchanged information.

13:17.718 --> 13:19.685
One or both of us
may be under surveillance,

13:19.720 --> 13:21.910
but I haven't been talking to IAB.

13:22.756 --> 13:24.690
My partner Parker told me the same thing

13:24.725 --> 13:27.259
right before my unit killed him for it.

13:28.395 --> 13:29.962
If you think that you're next,

13:29.996 --> 13:31.230
then do something about it.

13:31.264 --> 13:33.232
Expose what Parker knew.

13:33.266 --> 13:36.368
Why was he talking to Internal Affairs?

13:36.403 --> 13:38.137
You need to forget you know me,

13:38.171 --> 13:41.273
and if you have any kind
of survival instinct...

13:41.308 --> 13:42.942
don't make any more moves.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.149
It's three shots.
That's excessive for a robbery.

13:50.183 --> 13:51.584
Yeah, and more precise pattern

13:51.618 --> 13:53.385
than your average
liquor-store gunslinger.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.154
I recognize the signature.

13:55.188 --> 13:57.957
You think he went to
a reporter different than Nate

13:57.991 --> 13:59.992
to prove his son's innocence
in Nava's murder?

14:00.026 --> 14:01.160
I thought I was pretty persuasive.

14:01.194 --> 14:03.162
Someone finish your homework, Loman?

14:03.196 --> 14:05.164
Jeez, Woz. What, did Linda

14:05.198 --> 14:07.099
get sick of you leaving
the toilet seat up?

14:07.134 --> 14:09.835
Domestic abuse funny to you, Tess?

14:09.870 --> 14:11.637
I thought you silenced him.

14:11.671 --> 14:12.538
Not as permanently

14:12.572 --> 14:13.506
as intelligence would have preferred.

14:13.540 --> 14:15.307
Is that what you were
discussing last night

14:15.342 --> 14:16.942
on your date with Carrot Top?

14:16.977 --> 14:19.779
He thanked me for taking care
of his loose ends.

14:19.813 --> 14:21.229
Probably already knew he was
coming here in the morning.

14:21.264 --> 14:23.783
Did this intelligence officer
ask you how you knew

14:23.817 --> 14:26.018
that their patsy's father was talking?

14:26.052 --> 14:27.086
He didn't know about Nate.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.822
But they seem to know just
about everything else.

14:32.459 --> 14:34.026
You think we led them here?

14:34.060 --> 14:36.428
You find your ginger
boyfriend and his pal,

14:36.463 --> 14:37.997
and you sit on them,

14:38.031 --> 14:39.965
and you don't let them get near Nate.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.168
Both of you, keep eyes on my son.

14:42.202 --> 14:45.702
- Yo, Woz, where you going?
- To prevent World War III.

14:52.012 --> 14:55.781
Blatant vandalism and consumer theft.

14:55.816 --> 14:57.983
Wait until Internal Affairs
hears about this.

14:58.018 --> 15:00.786
I'll cop to the vandalism,
but it's not theft

15:00.821 --> 15:03.189
if you've already paid for it... twice.

15:03.223 --> 15:05.457
Guess the real issue
is if Internal Affairs

15:05.492 --> 15:07.860
already knows about it, who else does?

15:07.894 --> 15:09.767
My mom would probably get a call.

15:11.932 --> 15:14.466
I heard a rumor that
your department has a leak.

15:15.402 --> 15:18.237
Victory.

15:18.271 --> 15:19.905
I love rumors. They always allow me

15:19.940 --> 15:21.407
to learn things about myself
that I never knew.

15:21.441 --> 15:23.676
Sunrise massacre?

15:23.710 --> 15:26.245
A dead NYPD Intelligence Officer?

15:26.279 --> 15:27.379
That's not sufficient confirmation

15:27.414 --> 15:29.579
that you guys need a plumber?

15:30.250 --> 15:31.383
You're suggesting that Detective Parker

15:31.418 --> 15:33.219
set a rendezvous with IA,

15:33.253 --> 15:34.720
and that's what got him murdered?

15:34.754 --> 15:36.322
He wasn't killed in the line of duty

15:36.356 --> 15:37.890
by a suspect that you yourself put down?

15:37.924 --> 15:39.191
Isn't that the kind of urban legend

15:39.226 --> 15:40.426
that keeps you guys in business?

15:40.460 --> 15:42.862
Not if it runs into actual evidence.

15:42.896 --> 15:44.263
So you guys were not talking to Parker?

15:44.297 --> 15:46.098
Cop gets killed,

15:46.132 --> 15:49.101
I'm forced to entertain
malfeasance by other cops.

15:49.135 --> 15:51.036
What makes you go there?

15:51.071 --> 15:53.105
- Just working a hypothetical.
- Mm.

15:53.139 --> 15:55.730
Well, unfortunately,
we're beyond that stage.

15:56.243 --> 15:58.043
You know, ballistics confirmed
that every bullet

15:58.078 --> 15:59.278
in the Sunrise Cafe

15:59.312 --> 16:01.347
not discharged by Officer Parker,

16:01.381 --> 16:02.748
including the one in his skull,

16:02.782 --> 16:05.484
were fired by the suspect
that you put down.

16:07.554 --> 16:09.121
So all the slugs
in the diner matched the ones

16:09.155 --> 16:10.856
in the parking lot where I shot Morris.

16:10.891 --> 16:12.747
Inconsistent with your story.

16:13.927 --> 16:15.227
That surprise you, Detective?

16:34.719 --> 16:37.520
- What's this?
- Said you were starving.

16:37.985 --> 16:39.723
Is this your way of calling me fat?

16:39.757 --> 16:41.458
Everybody knows the first
rule of a stakeout

16:41.492 --> 16:42.792
is get the food before you start.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.728
Okay.

16:44.762 --> 16:46.396
Do you recognize this 9 mil?

16:46.430 --> 16:47.581
What's so special about this

16:47.606 --> 16:49.140
that you tracked me down on a stakeout?

16:49.165 --> 16:50.766
It just morphed into the drop gun

16:50.800 --> 16:53.268
that you planted on Morris
outside the Sunrise Cafe.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.270
- What?
- It also matches every victim

16:55.305 --> 16:57.039
and slug in that diner,

16:57.073 --> 16:59.675
including the one in
the dead Intelligence officer.

16:59.709 --> 17:01.543
That's not the gun I planted.

17:01.578 --> 17:03.545
I have never seen this weapon before.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.896
Well, now it's tagged
in evidence and present

17:05.930 --> 17:07.983
in every single crime scene photo.

17:08.017 --> 17:10.519
You know, I knew Intelligence had reach,

17:10.553 --> 17:13.689
but how many departments would
a swap like that involve?

17:13.723 --> 17:15.857
Maybe Woz is right.

17:15.892 --> 17:17.259
They are untouchable.

17:20.829 --> 17:23.031
They're still covering up their tracks.

17:23.066 --> 17:25.032
What if I told you
the cover-up went beyond

17:25.068 --> 17:26.935
Nava's murder suspect, Cesar Molina?

17:31.207 --> 17:33.569
I thought Woz put you on a stakeout.

17:33.604 --> 17:37.546
- He did.
- Woz has you tailing Intelligence?

17:37.580 --> 17:39.648
Turns out I led them straight
to another loose end.

17:39.682 --> 17:42.884
- Just one minute... uh...
- He's expecting me.

17:42.919 --> 17:44.886
I would have brought wine,

17:44.921 --> 17:48.190
but the liquor store's
closed for a shooting.

17:48.224 --> 17:50.258
Seems we frequent
the same establishments.

17:50.293 --> 17:54.229
The old man had given up
defending his son's legacy.

17:54.263 --> 17:55.864
I appreciate Detective Loman's effort,

17:55.898 --> 17:58.900
but as a rule, I'm not a fan
of half measures.

17:58.935 --> 18:02.237
Yeah, well, that's one thing
that you and I have in common.

18:02.271 --> 18:05.874
I like security
and a good night's sleep...

18:05.908 --> 18:08.279
which is why I'm glad you're here.

18:08.711 --> 18:11.913
What's this, an essay on the correlation

18:11.948 --> 18:15.250
between God complexes
and erectile dysfunction?

18:15.284 --> 18:17.252
Close. It's an article being written

18:17.286 --> 18:19.755
by an intrepid young reporter
named Nate Wozniak.

18:19.789 --> 18:21.757
I assume you counseled your son
on the hazards

18:21.791 --> 18:24.192
of fronting a story
about repentant felons.

18:24.227 --> 18:25.794
Ignore the typos. It's a first draft.

18:25.828 --> 18:28.230
- How did you get this?
- If it's written on a computer

18:28.264 --> 18:29.765
with a Wi-Fi connection, it's available.

18:29.799 --> 18:32.100
Not without a warrant, it's not.

18:32.135 --> 18:33.702
It's all zeroes and ones.

18:33.736 --> 18:35.303
I could listen to your
dinner conversation

18:35.338 --> 18:37.305
using a refrigerator
if I were so inclined.

18:37.340 --> 18:40.019
All that matters is access,
and I have it.

18:40.777 --> 18:43.745
Was it you that said
"God complex," or was that me?

18:45.114 --> 18:46.734
The money's better down here.

18:49.318 --> 18:51.620
Remember what happened to God's son?

18:51.654 --> 18:52.888
Rough day.

18:52.922 --> 18:54.890
Tough on Dad, too.

18:54.924 --> 18:58.827
"Father, why have you forsaken me?"

19:01.931 --> 19:06.337
You could probably have the
Pope fired if you wanted to...

19:07.336 --> 19:09.404
but if you threaten my son again,

19:09.439 --> 19:12.174
the wall behind you
is getting a new paint job.

19:12.208 --> 19:14.443
Our dead suspect's father
gave Nate a second source.

19:14.477 --> 19:15.977
It's quoted on page two.

19:17.014 --> 19:19.147
Anonymous for now.

19:19.182 --> 19:21.950
But it gives our man an alibi
in James Nava's murder.

19:21.984 --> 19:24.019
Not anonymous to you.

19:24.053 --> 19:28.156
You got the source out of the
old man before you shot him.

19:28.191 --> 19:29.825
I can send one of my men,

19:29.859 --> 19:31.693
but as you always seem to trip over them,

19:31.728 --> 19:34.963
perhaps you'd like a chance
to remedy this development.

19:34.997 --> 19:36.431
No more half measures.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.412
I need to know we're all rowing
in the same direction.

19:40.503 --> 19:43.238
I'll take care of it. Then it's over.

19:45.710 --> 19:48.210
A warrant, one witness interview,

19:48.244 --> 19:49.878
and now lunch?

19:49.912 --> 19:52.013
For a couple of "elite"
Intelligence detectives,

19:52.048 --> 19:54.468
they sure have a lot
of free time on their hands.

19:55.218 --> 19:57.018
When do you think it happened for them?

19:57.053 --> 19:58.820
Ramsey strikes me as the kind of guy

19:58.855 --> 20:01.022
who cherry picks his own crew.

20:01.057 --> 20:03.458
Think they joined the force
as cadets to murder lawyers

20:03.493 --> 20:05.761
and liquor store owners?

20:08.331 --> 20:10.398
Harlee, I'm sorry.

20:10.433 --> 20:12.501
We thought spiking Nate's story
was the best way

20:12.535 --> 20:15.837
to protect him and
our bad shoot at the Sunrise.

20:15.872 --> 20:18.006
Yeah, that's been my go-to too.

20:19.342 --> 20:22.144
Got to protect our own, right?

20:22.178 --> 20:25.180
No one could have predicted
that they'd go as far

20:25.214 --> 20:26.834
as to kill an ADA.

20:31.254 --> 20:32.721
You think anyone could have predicted

20:32.755 --> 20:35.051
how far you or I would go?

20:35.758 --> 20:38.346
It doesn't feel like you have
any options when you're in it.

20:38.895 --> 20:40.681
It's not too late for your moment.

20:42.064 --> 20:44.266
You just have to reach back
to that part of yourself

20:44.300 --> 20:47.402
that chose to wear the shield
in the first place.

20:52.074 --> 20:54.910
- Their day just got exciting.
- How do you figure that?

20:54.944 --> 20:57.073
Those are $5 shakes they just tossed.

21:18.801 --> 21:21.102
I'd have thought you preferred wine.

21:21.137 --> 21:23.071
Mm-mm.

21:23.105 --> 21:27.542
It's Mexican brandy.
I... I acquired a taste for it.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.512
Thought we could celebrate our reunion.

21:31.981 --> 21:35.283
I, um... I...

21:35.318 --> 21:37.586
Robert, I don't have the wig anymore.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.221
I've actually liberated myself

21:39.255 --> 21:41.223
from that particular proclivity.

21:42.284 --> 21:45.126
Is there, um... anything else you'd like?

21:45.161 --> 21:47.373
Not that kind of visit, Gina.

21:50.933 --> 21:52.300
Try the brandy.

22:03.546 --> 22:05.380
Savor it.

22:07.350 --> 22:10.018
See, you have to appreciate life's...

22:10.052 --> 22:12.815
little pleasures while you can.

22:13.289 --> 22:16.992
The sources of our joy,
our relationships...

22:17.026 --> 22:18.360
achievements that define us

22:18.394 --> 22:21.782
can all be ripped away
from us at any minute.

22:23.332 --> 22:25.828
You've been spending time with Harlee.

22:26.302 --> 22:28.536
- But...
- It's...

22:28.571 --> 22:32.374
a good thing, Gina... potentially.

22:32.408 --> 22:34.175
I only told her what she already knew.

22:34.210 --> 22:36.255
Shh.

22:37.213 --> 22:40.282
I am more interested
in what she's told you.

22:40.316 --> 22:43.385
She's been coming over almost every week.

22:43.419 --> 22:46.121
That is a lot of girl talk.

22:46.155 --> 22:48.156
I just listen.

22:48.190 --> 22:50.525
To her lies?

22:50.559 --> 22:52.360
That's okay. I mean,

22:52.395 --> 22:54.815
that is what she does to good people.

22:56.065 --> 22:57.902
Disorients.

22:59.268 --> 23:01.169
Makes you need her,

23:01.203 --> 23:03.872
and she extracts what she wants and...

23:04.742 --> 23:06.274
tosses you away.

23:09.178 --> 23:11.079
She can't stop thinking about you...

23:11.113 --> 23:13.315
why you let her live.

23:13.349 --> 23:15.150
She listens to the recording
of your 911 call

23:15.184 --> 23:18.005
of that day... over and over.

23:20.423 --> 23:22.691
You need to be really careful here.

23:22.725 --> 23:26.061
Trust me. I speak from experience.

23:26.095 --> 23:28.363
Harlee Santos...

23:28.397 --> 23:31.433
is a narcissistic psychopath...

23:31.467 --> 23:32.901
and a murderer.

23:32.935 --> 23:34.936
And yet, she had me obsessed with her

23:34.971 --> 23:37.191
and you feeling sorry for her.

23:38.207 --> 23:40.611
And that's her power.

23:41.477 --> 23:45.213
But I think that together,

23:45.247 --> 23:47.515
you and me can use that manipulation

23:47.550 --> 23:49.117
against her...

23:49.151 --> 23:52.520
can get into her head
like she climbed into ours,

23:52.555 --> 23:55.056
have her doubting her own sanity.

23:55.091 --> 23:57.920
And then we can both be free.

23:59.462 --> 24:01.882
You want to be free, don't you?

24:02.431 --> 24:04.218
Yes.

24:05.067 --> 24:06.434
That's my girl.

24:17.853 --> 24:19.348
Well, Nate came down
Yofor a cigarette break

24:19.373 --> 24:21.074
about 40 minutes ago.

24:21.108 --> 24:22.041
Other than that, he's been tucked away

24:22.076 --> 24:23.576
in his office safe and sound.

24:23.611 --> 24:26.379
Cigarette? Since when does he smoke?

24:26.413 --> 24:28.648
- Oops.
- What, did everything turn

24:28.682 --> 24:30.416
to crap while I was gone?

24:30.451 --> 24:32.285
You're asking the two in the patrol car?

24:32.319 --> 24:34.420
That reminds me. We got to
roll back to the precinct.

24:34.455 --> 24:35.955
I set up a meeting with the new captain

24:35.990 --> 24:37.223
so you can kiss his ring

24:37.257 --> 24:38.424
so you can get out of these blues.

24:38.459 --> 24:40.159
About damn time.

24:40.194 --> 24:41.160
I mean, thank you, Woz.

24:41.195 --> 24:42.287
When? When is it?

24:42.321 --> 24:43.963
Y-you're already late.

24:43.998 --> 24:45.498
I'll handle it from here.

24:45.532 --> 24:47.734
Yeah.

24:48.234 --> 24:50.336
Still quiet.

24:50.371 --> 24:52.271
Our friends have taken
to backing up patrol calls.

24:52.306 --> 24:54.941
All right, stand down.
I'll handle the situation.

24:54.975 --> 24:57.477
Stand down?
Have you talked to Ramsey yet?

24:57.511 --> 24:59.278
Woz. Hello?

25:01.181 --> 25:02.448
We're leaving?

25:02.483 --> 25:04.862
Says he has a handle on the situation.

25:05.452 --> 25:07.387
You think he's bailing Ramsey out again?

25:09.909 --> 25:13.848
Dispatch, Tango-9303 arriving
on scene at the Embassy Hotel,

25:13.883 --> 25:15.528
200 block of Prospect.

25:15.562 --> 25:17.630
Please confirm the nature of the call.

25:17.665 --> 25:19.766
<i>Roger, Tango-9303.</i>

25:19.800 --> 25:22.101
<i>That's a 911 involving a 10-18.</i>

25:22.136 --> 25:23.469
A domestic disturbance?

25:23.504 --> 25:25.471
Copy that.

25:25.506 --> 25:27.707
These guys are really having a slow day.

25:27.741 --> 25:29.008
You going in?

25:29.043 --> 25:31.110
Time to play offense.

25:32.212 --> 25:34.113
You know, you could have come inside.

25:34.148 --> 25:36.115
Newsroom could use a little discipline.

25:36.150 --> 25:39.185
Thought you could use a cigarette break.

25:39.219 --> 25:40.987
Ha. Yeah? And what are the chances I get

25:41.021 --> 25:43.734
a straight answer about
the status of your face?

25:45.192 --> 25:48.494
Cesar Molina's father is dead.

25:49.031 --> 25:52.331
The liquor store owner
who won't return your calls?

25:55.202 --> 25:57.303
Let me guess: attempted robbery?

25:57.337 --> 26:00.709
These are dangerous people, Nate.

26:01.241 --> 26:04.377
They won't make exceptions
for the First Amendment.

26:04.411 --> 26:06.479
Define "these people."

26:08.182 --> 26:10.049
Nobody you can write about.

26:10.084 --> 26:12.930
- Off the record, Dad.
- Off the record?

26:14.188 --> 26:16.556
It's nobody that you can write about.

26:16.590 --> 26:18.224
It's not just his father's words.

26:18.258 --> 26:20.359
Cesar's priest from when he was in prison

26:20.394 --> 26:22.528
the night Nava got killed...
they finally had

26:22.563 --> 26:24.263
that beer and movie
they've been talking about.

26:24.298 --> 26:25.832
Now I know you know the concept, Dad.

26:25.866 --> 26:27.736
It's called an alibi, all right?

26:28.702 --> 26:30.636
Take my word on this.

26:31.872 --> 26:34.868
Okay? Stay away from the Molina case.

26:39.313 --> 26:41.280
You recognize either one of them?

26:41.315 --> 26:42.548
Somebody important we should know?

26:42.583 --> 26:44.450
I don't see paparazzi.

26:44.485 --> 26:46.686
Look how she flinches
every time he gestures.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.421
Why would they keep the victim

26:48.455 --> 26:50.217
and the abuser together?

26:51.391 --> 26:53.693
Detective Santos and Loman
from the six four.

26:53.727 --> 26:55.094
This is our 10-18?

26:55.129 --> 26:56.462
You're the second pair
of shields on-site.

26:56.497 --> 26:59.265
He's got to be somebody to someone.

27:05.639 --> 27:08.741
Miss, can I talk to you
alone for a minute?

27:08.776 --> 27:11.744
There's no need for privacy.
This was a misunderstanding.

27:11.779 --> 27:13.079
And we're just trying to clear it up.

27:13.113 --> 27:15.114
- What's your name?
- Vanessa.

27:15.149 --> 27:17.617
Hey.

27:17.651 --> 27:20.497
Back off, okay? Let her answer herself.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.749
I was only getting her
primed for you, officer.

27:23.857 --> 27:25.758
You don't have to say anything.

27:25.793 --> 27:28.594
Just nod, and I can make it go away.

27:31.165 --> 27:33.132
I used to be good at hiding it too.

27:33.167 --> 27:35.053
Okay? I know all the tricks.

27:36.470 --> 27:38.404
Interviewing a material witness, big guy.

27:38.438 --> 27:40.273
Thought you'd have learned
to duck by now.

27:40.307 --> 27:42.175
That he didn't have any power over me.

27:42.209 --> 27:44.510
Please. You're making this worse.

27:44.545 --> 27:46.846
- Then help me make it better.
- Thank you, Detective.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.481
We have her statement.

27:48.515 --> 27:51.137
Why don't you two go check
the parking meters?

27:51.171 --> 27:54.153
From liquor store robberies
to domestic violence.

27:54.188 --> 27:55.254
You guys are really
moving up in the world.

27:55.289 --> 27:58.357
Community relations, honey.
Go ahead and uncuff him.

27:58.392 --> 28:00.626
What, so he can work her over better?

28:00.661 --> 28:02.795
I don't need a windup
to make an impression.

28:02.830 --> 28:04.197
You too, Detectives.

28:04.231 --> 28:05.832
Move along. We've got it from here.

28:05.866 --> 28:08.768
- Who is this clown to you two?
- Diplomatic courtesy.

28:08.802 --> 28:10.536
And how much is that costing him?

28:10.571 --> 28:13.606
Don't you have a pawn shop
to shake down or something?

28:13.640 --> 28:16.475
Right now something else
is catching my interest.

28:16.510 --> 28:19.879
Our advice: on this one,
get uninterested.

28:19.913 --> 28:22.548
I'd listen to them, bonita.

28:30.591 --> 28:33.392
Ah, date with the new captain?

28:33.427 --> 28:34.694
Whatever gets me out of this uniform

28:34.728 --> 28:36.896
and back to a decent pay bracket.

28:36.930 --> 28:39.498
You get out of that uniform,
the raise will follow...

28:39.533 --> 28:41.167
solve all your problems.

28:41.201 --> 28:42.535
I warmed him up for you.

28:42.569 --> 28:44.670
- Hey, you the fluffer?
- Why?

28:44.705 --> 28:45.838
You need a tip?

28:45.873 --> 28:48.207
Officer Nazario? You're up.

28:50.544 --> 28:52.345
- Carlos Espada.
<i>- What's up?</i>

28:52.379 --> 28:53.346
- It's Wallace.
<i>- Hey, what's up, man?</i>

28:53.380 --> 28:54.704
You looking for your brother?
He's right here.

28:54.738 --> 28:56.716
No, Wozniack. Do you know where he is?

28:56.750 --> 28:58.718
Yo, is that Wallace?

28:58.752 --> 29:00.686
I'm sorry, my bad. Who... who is this?

29:00.721 --> 29:02.688
Wallace. Wozniak was supposed to meet me

29:02.723 --> 29:04.223
at my job 20 minutes ago.

29:04.258 --> 29:06.359
- Is that my brother?
- Liquor store witness.

29:06.393 --> 29:08.361
When was all this arranged?

29:08.395 --> 29:10.263
<i>This morning. After you seized</i>

29:10.297 --> 29:11.535
his product yesterday, Dixon came to me

29:11.570 --> 29:13.699
looking for extra muscle
to meet with his supplier.

29:13.734 --> 29:15.779
And this was sanctioned by us?

29:16.403 --> 29:18.537
Never mind. Wozniak just showed.

29:18.572 --> 29:20.239
Later.

29:20.274 --> 29:22.241
Wait, wait, wait.

29:22.276 --> 29:23.776
What was that all about?

29:23.810 --> 29:25.211
Some witness said he was supposed to

29:25.245 --> 29:26.412
meet up with Wozniak.

29:26.446 --> 29:29.015
Then why did you say, "Are
you looking for your brother?"

29:29.049 --> 29:30.516
'Cause he sounded
like Wallace for a second.

29:30.550 --> 29:32.251
And why aren't you looking at me?

29:34.988 --> 29:37.091
Did you see that look on her face?

29:37.125 --> 29:39.558
The one that says she knows
what's coming later?

29:39.593 --> 29:41.427
"To protect and to serve"...

29:41.461 --> 29:43.515
unless we get in someone's way.

29:44.064 --> 29:45.934
They're not untouchable.

29:46.900 --> 29:48.770
Not forever.

29:49.937 --> 29:53.906
Ever bully, from wife beaters
to gangsters to dictators...

29:56.443 --> 29:59.045
They can seem invincible for a while,

29:59.079 --> 30:01.580
until, almost always, they're not.

30:01.615 --> 30:03.416
Maybe... after enough people
hurl themselves

30:03.450 --> 30:04.750
- in front of a tank.
- That's the question,

30:04.785 --> 30:06.419
though, isn't it?

30:06.453 --> 30:08.054
Knowing that tank
will probably flatten you.

30:10.791 --> 30:12.825
- Turn the car around.
- Harlee, you sure?

30:12.859 --> 30:14.593
Turn the car around now, Loman.

30:17.364 --> 30:18.764
Ever since Woz has been sidelined

30:18.799 --> 30:19.999
with a bullet in his back,

30:20.033 --> 30:20.967
the neighborhood's been slipping away.

30:21.001 --> 30:22.001
And nature abhors a void.

30:22.035 --> 30:23.336
So you fill it with my brother?

30:23.370 --> 30:24.370
He made a bigger difference

30:24.404 --> 30:25.805
with one undercover
than we had in two months.

30:25.839 --> 30:26.772
You don't get to make that call.

30:35.649 --> 30:37.950
How about turning off the mood lighting?

30:37.985 --> 30:39.986
Y'all trading baseball cards?

30:40.020 --> 30:41.787
Hey, little brother, you got to know...

30:41.822 --> 30:43.289
I got to know nothing from you.

30:43.323 --> 30:45.624
Start talking, Lieutenant.

30:45.659 --> 30:48.794
Looks like somebody else
already started talking.

30:48.829 --> 30:50.463
What's in the bag, Woz?

30:50.497 --> 30:52.465
If your brother's gonna be
muscle for a drug dealer,

30:52.499 --> 30:53.866
he's got to be strapped.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.035
You're giving a gun to a parolee?

30:56.069 --> 30:57.517
I wasn't gonna let him keep it.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.538
But you're gonna let him
dive headfirst into a world

30:59.573 --> 31:01.507
that put him in prison for eight years?

31:01.541 --> 31:03.843
Didn't seem to bother you
when he was fixing problems

31:03.877 --> 31:06.312
- for you and Tess.
- So now he's on the payroll?

31:06.346 --> 31:08.814
He volunteered... for a noble cause.

31:08.849 --> 31:10.483
He doesn't get to volunteer.

31:10.517 --> 31:11.684
I'm responsible for him.

31:11.718 --> 31:13.552
Well, welcome to my world!

31:13.587 --> 31:17.656
I'm responsible for all you ingrates.

31:17.691 --> 31:20.393
Responsible for when you want
to follow your own mind,

31:20.427 --> 31:22.328
no matter how obvious it is to me

31:22.362 --> 31:24.497
that you're making a mistake.

31:24.531 --> 31:27.033
Drugs on the street
are never won or lost, Woz.

31:27.067 --> 31:28.801
No sense in putting family
at risk to push

31:28.835 --> 31:30.836
a damn rock up a hill.

31:30.871 --> 31:33.072
Every minute he stays in that life,

31:33.106 --> 31:35.641
it'll take twice as long to get him out.

31:35.675 --> 31:38.711
Try to remember who's made
what sacrifices.

31:45.419 --> 31:46.852
Wallace...

31:46.887 --> 31:49.755
you're gonna sit this one out.

31:49.790 --> 31:53.145
Give your little brother
here the time and place.

31:55.929 --> 31:58.290
- That suit you?
- Huh.

32:04.871 --> 32:06.705
Do we move now?

32:06.740 --> 32:08.368
After he pulls away.

32:39.606 --> 32:41.140
License and registration.

32:41.174 --> 32:42.908
You got demoted to traffic cop?

32:42.943 --> 32:44.910
More like garbage duty.

32:44.945 --> 32:46.712
Ma'am, can you step out
of the vehicle, please?

32:46.746 --> 32:48.614
She's not the one driving.

32:48.648 --> 32:50.483
I'm not talking to you.

32:50.517 --> 32:52.204
Ma'am.

32:53.019 --> 32:55.087
I'm fine, Officer. Really.

32:55.122 --> 32:57.334
See? She's fine.

32:58.125 --> 33:00.226
- Here you go.
- What's that?

33:00.806 --> 33:02.674
Why you pulled me over.

33:04.164 --> 33:06.599
You wanted your taste, no?

33:08.802 --> 33:10.236
Okay, you can both step out of the car.

33:10.270 --> 33:12.104
You saw what happened back at the hotel.

33:12.139 --> 33:14.173
I have friends with you, remember?

33:14.207 --> 33:15.841
You're gonna want to consider
the next five seconds

33:15.876 --> 33:17.042
very carefully.

33:19.733 --> 33:22.535
I said step out the car... now.

33:24.576 --> 33:26.010
Got to say, Wallace...

33:26.571 --> 33:28.913
this is one of those choices
I just do not get.

33:29.334 --> 33:31.250
Yeah, I know my track record
ain't free of those,

33:31.284 --> 33:33.057
but this is different.

33:33.091 --> 33:35.239
Why, because you're running with the cops

33:35.274 --> 33:36.507
instead of away from them?

33:36.542 --> 33:38.124
Because this feels right.

33:40.210 --> 33:42.413
Do you remember
Laurel Lake in the summer?

33:42.447 --> 33:44.515
You were trying to impress a girl.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.618
Tried to swim your ass
under that low bridge.

33:47.653 --> 33:49.487
Those girls were impressed as hell.

33:49.521 --> 33:51.422
Well, I remember standing
on that bridge...

33:51.456 --> 33:53.524
must have been six or seven,

33:53.559 --> 33:55.426
watching you go under,
running to the other side,

33:55.460 --> 33:57.102
and just waiting.

33:57.863 --> 34:00.798
Took about two seconds
for the panic to start...

34:00.832 --> 34:02.649
the helplessness.

34:03.168 --> 34:05.836
My brother was in trouble
and I couldn't get to him.

34:05.871 --> 34:07.672
I felt that way when
you were on the inside too.

34:07.706 --> 34:09.406
I...

34:10.542 --> 34:12.534
can't feel that again.

34:13.145 --> 34:14.612
I made it under that bridge, didn't I?

34:14.646 --> 34:16.380
You're not a trained cop.

34:16.415 --> 34:18.114
Don't forget I survived
the streets and the joint...

34:18.150 --> 34:19.875
all that time.

34:21.652 --> 34:23.286
You know, it's been a long
while since I've felt like

34:23.322 --> 34:25.556
I have purpose on my own.

34:25.591 --> 34:27.716
And doing this?

34:28.260 --> 34:30.594
For the first time since Laurel Lake...

34:32.230 --> 34:33.931
I'm feeling like Superman.

34:42.674 --> 34:44.842
Get in the car.

34:50.449 --> 34:51.681
Gina, I'm here with Director Baker.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.150
Can you repeat what you just told me?

34:53.185 --> 34:54.251
<i>I couldn't tell you this before</i>

34:54.286 --> 34:56.219
<i>because Harlee was there,</i>

34:56.254 --> 34:58.489
but Harlee was as obsessed
with Agent Stahl

34:58.523 --> 35:00.999
as she said that he was with her.

35:01.727 --> 35:04.195
She told me she watches
videos of Stahl...

35:04.229 --> 35:08.048
<i>of his bedroom... from the
camera that she hid there.</i>

35:10.316 --> 35:12.550
Video of, uh... of him...

35:12.585 --> 35:14.179
with me.

35:15.087 --> 35:17.432
When I was pretending to be her.

35:17.990 --> 35:22.227
<i>She told me the day
in the cabin with Stahl,</i>

35:22.261 --> 35:24.629
<i>she called him to her apartment first.</i>

35:24.663 --> 35:27.599
<i>She tried to drug him,
to get him off her back,</i>

35:27.633 --> 35:32.771
but she knew that Stahl
would never just give up.

35:32.805 --> 35:34.839
<i>She said that she knew</i>

35:34.874 --> 35:39.162
<i>the only way to stop
Stahl would be to kill him.</i>

35:39.879 --> 35:41.748
<i>She's dangerous.</i>

35:43.115 --> 35:45.293
<i>I'm really scared of her.</i>

35:45.951 --> 35:47.018
What are you doing? You trying to get us

35:47.053 --> 35:49.087
- both killed?
- I'm not the one

35:49.121 --> 35:50.789
- ordering the hits.
- You arrested someone who's

35:50.823 --> 35:52.757
- under our protection.
- Attempted bribery

35:52.792 --> 35:54.959
- of a police officer.
- You need to let this go.

35:54.994 --> 35:57.362
Like you let your partner's death go?

35:57.396 --> 35:59.164
Does that look familiar?

36:01.133 --> 36:02.867
It's Bennett's plant gun,
and now the murder weapon

36:02.902 --> 36:04.669
used by the man you shot at the Sunrise.

36:04.703 --> 36:05.804
- You knew?
- Yes, I knew.

36:05.838 --> 36:07.772
I could do something about it
or I could stay alive.

36:07.807 --> 36:09.674
When was the last time
you actually felt like a cop?

36:09.708 --> 36:12.277
Your unit's not exactly
collecting integrity medals.

36:12.311 --> 36:14.379
- Or dead bodies, at your pace.
- You sure about that?

36:14.413 --> 36:15.947
An entire gang could be wiped out tonight

36:15.981 --> 36:17.949
because of your raid
on that beauty salon.

36:17.983 --> 36:19.350
- What beauty salon?
- Your boss disrupted

36:19.385 --> 36:21.619
a drug mule outfit in Midwood

36:21.654 --> 36:22.787
with zero concern for the fallout.

36:22.822 --> 36:24.789
More friends of yours?

36:24.824 --> 36:27.025
Seriously, what is your plan?

36:27.059 --> 36:29.127
To expose your own bad shoot?

36:29.161 --> 36:30.862
To keep pushing Ramsey
till he comes after you?

36:30.896 --> 36:32.924
To be waiting for him when he does.

36:33.365 --> 36:36.167
Well, don't shoot to kill.
I'll be the one he sends.

36:45.344 --> 36:46.978
Hey, Father.

36:47.385 --> 36:49.487
Never seen wind this violent.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.418
When it kicks up like this,

36:53.452 --> 36:57.322
it always makes me think
a judgment is coming.

36:57.356 --> 36:59.224
That why you're here?

36:59.258 --> 37:02.327
No, I know where I stand.

37:02.361 --> 37:05.163
Most people who walk
through those doors do so

37:05.197 --> 37:06.197
in search of something.

37:09.368 --> 37:11.796
My son is in danger...

37:12.905 --> 37:15.300
unless I do something...

37:16.041 --> 37:17.876
unforgivable.

37:17.910 --> 37:19.911
These men I counsel in prison came to see

37:19.945 --> 37:21.806
that nothing's unforgivable...

37:22.982 --> 37:24.716
if you ask for forgiveness.

37:24.750 --> 37:28.953
Did Cesar Molina ask for forgiveness?

37:29.564 --> 37:31.733
Did he find peace...

37:32.391 --> 37:36.094
before that noose
tightened around his neck?

37:38.264 --> 37:41.284
Before he returned to His embrace...

37:41.901 --> 37:44.035
Cesar had found salvation.

37:44.069 --> 37:47.472
Well, w-what about for you?

37:47.506 --> 37:49.542
What's heaven like?

37:50.342 --> 37:52.777
Each of us has a vision
of what heaven might be.

37:52.811 --> 37:54.379
Yeah, but for you.

37:54.964 --> 37:57.282
What's your vision?

37:57.316 --> 38:00.051
Close your eyes,

38:00.085 --> 38:01.953
and I want you to tell me the...

38:01.987 --> 38:05.123
the first thing that happens.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.022
Music.

38:11.864 --> 38:13.858
For me, it's music.

38:14.433 --> 38:16.111
As it rises...

38:17.002 --> 38:20.405
it's as if every song and
every note exists at once...

38:20.439 --> 38:23.208
in harmony... without chaos.

38:27.179 --> 38:29.833
- Go on.
- Then the light comes.

38:30.449 --> 38:32.850
It's warm and full of comfort.

38:32.885 --> 38:35.353
I'm lifted off my feet
by the power of it,

38:35.387 --> 38:38.423
and I know without reservation
that I'm held in His arms...

38:38.457 --> 38:42.994
an eternity of peace
and illumination in His grace.

38:50.035 --> 38:52.971
Sometimes I envy your faith.

38:55.174 --> 38:57.735
Now if you're not in a hurry...

38:58.911 --> 39:01.865
to see that peaceful light...

39:02.581 --> 39:06.117
I'd stop defending Cesar Molina

39:06.151 --> 39:11.416
and volunteer for some missionary work...

39:12.057 --> 39:17.128
out of state. Tonight.

39:23.168 --> 39:25.136
What do you see?

39:25.170 --> 39:26.904
Darkness.

39:32.590 --> 39:34.590
All right.

39:34.617 --> 39:36.163
If you two fellas worked out

39:36.177 --> 39:39.002
which one of you got
more of Mommy's nipple,

39:39.033 --> 39:41.033
Let's keep this simple.

39:42.242 --> 39:44.743
All right, Wallace, answer it.

39:44.778 --> 39:46.545
- What, no wire?
- No, you never want

39:46.580 --> 39:48.547
to have to explain a wire.
I'll mute my end.

39:48.582 --> 39:50.216
Just keep it in your pocket
with the line on.

39:50.250 --> 39:53.185
- All right.
- Remember faces if you can,

39:53.220 --> 39:55.221
but what's most important
is to get a name.

39:55.255 --> 39:56.722
- Name, got it.
- All right.

39:56.756 --> 39:58.390
Keep your eyes open.

40:02.884 --> 40:05.164
Feel good to type his arrest report?

40:05.198 --> 40:06.198
Yeah.

40:06.233 --> 40:08.114
It'll have to be just the bribery.

40:08.149 --> 40:09.988
Couldn't get a statement out of the girl.

40:10.022 --> 40:13.060
I'll swing back by the hotel...

40:13.094 --> 40:15.174
try to get her to talk on my way home.

40:15.502 --> 40:18.137
- "John Johnson"?
- Don't hate.

40:18.171 --> 40:19.839
He thunk hard on that alias.

40:19.873 --> 40:22.976
- Prints in the system?
- No, but he can rot

40:23.011 --> 40:25.011
over there till he gives us
a name or calls a lawyer.

40:25.045 --> 40:27.013
He's banking on his
intelligence unit sponsors

40:27.047 --> 40:28.648
to bail him out.

40:28.682 --> 40:30.383
Paycheck's kind of heavy
this week, Loman.

40:30.417 --> 40:31.980
Logging that OT?

40:32.014 --> 40:33.753
What, are you being hazed or something?

40:33.787 --> 40:35.855
Penance. I owe Tufo a favor,

40:35.889 --> 40:37.523
so I decided to pick it up for him.

40:37.558 --> 40:39.392
- Penance? What did you do?
- Ask him.

40:39.426 --> 40:41.394
I ain't saying nothing
to anybody anymore.

40:41.428 --> 40:43.162
You can't snitch to family, bro.

40:43.196 --> 40:44.530
Yeah, you can, when the family

40:44.565 --> 40:46.886
be keeping mad secrets
from each other, bro.

40:47.634 --> 40:50.682
Cue the snitch in three, two...

40:52.472 --> 40:54.073
Wallace helped us ID a beauty salon

40:54.107 --> 40:56.709
that was cutting up
drug mules like lab rats,

40:56.743 --> 40:58.844
so now Woz has him posing
as muscle for a dealer

40:58.879 --> 41:00.613
who's patching things up
with his supplier.

41:00.647 --> 41:01.881
Today?

41:02.151 --> 41:03.716
That meeting's today?

41:04.112 --> 41:05.885
Yeah, right now. Why?

41:05.919 --> 41:08.888
Cole told me that entire
gang could be wiped out.

41:08.922 --> 41:10.890
They're not patching things up.

41:13.460 --> 41:15.695
You want to know a secret
about the bridge stunt?

41:15.729 --> 41:18.097
<i>I was trying to impress you.</i>

41:22.636 --> 41:24.103
Showtime.

41:27.174 --> 41:29.208
Yo, who picked this place?

41:29.242 --> 41:30.610
Asked for something natural.

41:30.644 --> 41:32.144
<i>Something wrong with a park?</i>

41:32.179 --> 41:33.412
You don't have to chat them up.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.580
Think it's an ambush?

41:34.615 --> 41:35.815
If Intelligence is as dialed-in

41:35.849 --> 41:37.149
as they want us to think they are.

41:40.995 --> 41:43.763
Everyone stay chill
and let me do the talking.

41:59.506 --> 42:00.906
Tufo's not picking up.

42:00.941 --> 42:02.108
Are you sure this is a trap?

42:02.142 --> 42:03.743
God, I hope not.

42:04.305 --> 42:10.773
