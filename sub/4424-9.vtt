Stan, are you okay?

00:47.923 --> 00:49.550
Yeah, Dad.
We're just rehearsing our band.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.509
Ohhhh.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.219
I thought a group
of Vietnamese people

00:52.344 --> 00:55.765
were having their intestines
pulled out through their mouths.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.311
He's right, dude.

01:00.436 --> 01:01.395
We have to define our style

01:01.520 --> 01:02.980
if we're ever going to make
a platinum album.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.148
I mean, I'm a fusion guy.

01:04.273 --> 01:05.983
But Kenny's background
is more Latin jazz.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.026
Mrph rm!

01:07.151 --> 01:09.195
Yeah. And I'm more hip-hop
and R&B-oriented.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.614
I think our band better buy
a whole bunch of music CDs

01:11.739 --> 01:13.449
to listen to for inspiration.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.284
Inspiration.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.285
Wait a minute.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.287
That's it!
Inspiration, you guys.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.830
- Don't you see?
- See what?

01:19.955 --> 01:23.709
Our band should play
Christian rock!

01:24.585 --> 01:25.961
Christian rock?
- Think about it!

01:26.087 --> 01:27.922
It's the easiest, crappiest
music in the world, right?

01:28.047 --> 01:30.091
If we just play songs
about how much we love Jesus,

01:30.216 --> 01:32.134
all the Christians
will buy our crap.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.636
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

01:33.761 --> 01:34.845
It worked for Creed!

01:34.970 --> 01:36.847
I don't want to be
in a stupid Christian rock band.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.974
You just start that way, Stan,
then you cross over.

01:39.100 --> 01:39.975
It's genius!

01:40.101 --> 01:41.310
Just get the hell out of here,
Cartman!

01:41.435 --> 01:43.270
You're not serious, and you're
a detriment to the band!

01:43.395 --> 01:44.063
Oh, yeah?

01:44.188 --> 01:46.732
I will bet you 10 bucks that if
I start a Christian rock band,

01:46.857 --> 01:48.776
I can get a platinum album
before you guys do!

01:48.901 --> 01:50.861
You're on, fat boy!
- Okay! Fine!

01:50.986 --> 01:53.405
Ready? First one to have
a platinum album wins.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.074
Go!

01:57.535 --> 01:59.245
What a stupid asshole.

02:01.372 --> 02:02.748
Platinum album!
Platinum album!

02:02.873 --> 02:04.458
Got to make a platinum album
before Kyle!

02:06.293 --> 02:07.503
Oh, hi, Eric.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.338
Butters, get your drum set
and meet me at my house!

02:09.463 --> 02:11.715
We have to make a platinum
album! Hurry, Butters!

02:12.842 --> 02:14.218
Oh.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.345
No time to waste!
Platinum album!

02:16.470 --> 02:17.638
Must beat Kyle!

02:18.264 --> 02:20.099
Token, get the bass guitar
out of your basement

02:20.224 --> 02:21.725
and meet me over at my house!

02:21.851 --> 02:23.978
What?!
We don't have a bass guitar.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.855
Your family's black, Token.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.356
There's bound to be
a bass guitar

02:27.481 --> 02:29.608
in your basement somewhere!

02:32.945 --> 02:34.530
Boy, you sure seem driven,
Eric.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.532
You must really have
some i-inspiration.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.117
Yes -- the tears
of Kyle Broflovski

02:38.242 --> 02:39.743
when he loses his $10 to me.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.954
Hey, there <i>was</i> a bass guitar
in my basement.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.414
I told you, Token.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.582
So what are we doing?

02:44.707 --> 02:46.083
Gentlemen,
we are about to embark

02:46.208 --> 02:47.418
on the most amazing,
life-affirming,

02:47.543 --> 02:49.628
financially windfalling
experiences of our young lives.

02:49.753 --> 02:50.671
Wow!

02:50.796 --> 02:53.591
We are going to start
a Christian rock band.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.509
Aw.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.261
I'm out.
- Wait!

02:57.386 --> 02:58.596
Walk out that door, Token,

02:58.721 --> 03:00.472
and you'll regret it
the rest of your life.

03:00.598 --> 03:01.932
Christians have
a built-in audience

03:02.057 --> 03:03.434
of over 180 million Americans.

03:03.559 --> 03:06.187
If each one of them buys just
one of our albums at $12.95,

03:06.312 --> 03:09.773
that would be...
- $2,331,000,000.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.901
Still want to leave, Token?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.029
Thank you.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.948
Dad, can I borrow $300?

03:18.073 --> 03:20.201
$300?
What in the world for?

03:20.326 --> 03:22.203
Our band can't find
a stylistic direction to go in.

03:22.328 --> 03:24.455
We need to go to the mall to buy
hundreds of CDs to listen to

03:24.580 --> 03:26.415
so we can define our sound.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.626
Sorry, Kyle. We gave you
your allowance already.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.836
Can't you see this is my dream?

03:30.961 --> 03:32.171
Music is my life!

03:32.296 --> 03:33.964
It wasn't your life yesterday.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.425
Look, Pops.
I've got the music inside me.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.593
It's in my soul.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.595
And I know my place is up
on that stage.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.431
I'm gonna make it to the top.
I just want your blessing, Pops.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.891
The answer is no, Kyle.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.768
Aw, come on, Dad!
Don't be such a Jew!

03:45.893 --> 03:47.770
Kyle, don't belittle
your own people!

03:50.105 --> 03:51.440
Hey, dude.
- It didn't work.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.776
My stupid Jew dad
won't lend me money for CDs.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.194
No, dude.
It's cool.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.780
Kenny says you can download
music for free on the Internet.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.822
Really?
- Rm!

03:58.948 --> 04:00.115
You got a computer?

04:02.034 --> 04:04.203
See? Everyone on the Internet
copies music from their CDs.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.580
We can download them for free
and play them on the computer!

04:06.705 --> 04:07.831
All right!
Cool!

04:07.957 --> 04:10.668
Let's download some Metallica
and some Stevie Wonder.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.169
Mrph rmhmhm rm!
- Kenny's right.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.672
We should download
some Judas Priest, too.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.173
Judas Priest.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.676
Wow! Downloading music for free
is awesome!

04:21.220 --> 04:23.806
What the hell is that?
- I don't know. Let me check --

04:23.931 --> 04:26.433
Freeze!
FBI!

04:26.558 --> 04:28.352
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

04:30.271 --> 04:33.065
Hands!
Let me see those hands!

04:33.190 --> 04:36.151
Tango team is at Point Bravo!
Suspects in custody!

04:36.735 --> 04:38.529
Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move!

04:38.654 --> 04:39.905
Move! Move! Move!
- Keep your hands up!

04:40.030 --> 04:41.240
Out to the car!
- Out to the car!

04:41.365 --> 04:43.242
Kyle, what did you do?

04:43.367 --> 04:45.077
I don't know!

04:45.202 --> 04:47.496
All right, guys.
This is gonna be so easy.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.164
All we have to do
to make Christian songs

04:49.290 --> 04:51.875
is take regular old songs
and add Jesus stuff to them.

04:52.001 --> 04:55.087
See, all we have to do
is cross out words like "baby"

04:55.212 --> 04:57.798
and "darling"
and replace them with...

04:57.923 --> 04:59.758
"Jesus."

04:59.883 --> 05:02.136
All right, Butters.
Give me a beat.

05:05.431 --> 05:06.640
Okay. Nice.
Very nice.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.768
All right, Token.
Give me a smooth bass line.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.187
I don't know how to play bass.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.606
Token, how many times
do we have to go through this?

05:14.732 --> 05:16.442
You're black.
You can play bass.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.193
I'm getting sick
of your stereotypes.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.863
Be as sick as you want. Just
give me a goddamn bass line!

05:25.534 --> 05:26.493
God damn it.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.081
All right.

Shut up!

06:02.404 --> 06:04.448
You downloaded a lot of songs.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.576
Says here you even downloaded
Judas Priest.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.037
That's hard time
you boys are looking at.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.164
You got anything to say
for yourselves?

06:12.748 --> 06:15.542
We...d-didn't think
it was that big a deal.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.961
Not a big deal?

06:18.087 --> 06:23.092
You think downloading music
for free is not a big deal?

06:23.217 --> 06:24.635
Put your coats on.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.470
I'm gonna show you something.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.722
And I don't think
you're gonna like it.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.852
This is the home of Lars Ulrich,
the drummer for Metallica.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.815
Look. There's Lars now,
sitting by his pool.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.150
What's the matter with him?

06:40.275 --> 06:42.027
This month,
he was hoping to have

06:42.152 --> 06:43.237
a gold-plated shark-tank bar

06:43.362 --> 06:44.822
installed right next
to the pool.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.491
But thanks to people downloading
his music for free,

06:47.616 --> 06:50.077
he must now wait a few months
before he can afford it.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.206
Come.
There's more.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.000
Here's Britney Spears'
private jet.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.377
Notice anything?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.672
Britney used to have
a Gulfstream IV.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.007
Now she's had to sell it
and get a Gulfstream III

07:04.133 --> 07:07.469
because people like you chose
to download her music for free.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.516
The Gulfstream III doesn't
even have a remote control

07:12.641 --> 07:14.560
for its surround-sound
DVD system.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.521
Still think downloading music
for free is no big deal?

07:17.646 --> 07:20.649
We...didn't realize
what we were doing.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.860
That is the folly of man.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.070
Now look in this window.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.656
Here you see the loving family
of Master P.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.491
Next week is his son's birthday,

07:29.616 --> 07:32.661
and all he's ever wanted is
an island in French Polynesia.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.247
So he's gonna get it, right?

07:35.372 --> 07:37.374
I see an island
without an owner.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.626
If things keep going
the way they are,

07:39.751 --> 07:42.045
the child will not get
his tropical paradise.

07:42.171 --> 07:42.963
We're sorry!

07:43.088 --> 07:44.882
We'll never download music
for free again!

07:45.007 --> 07:47.426
Man must learn to think
of these horrible outcomes

07:47.551 --> 07:50.846
before he acts selfishly,
or else I fear...

07:50.971 --> 07:53.223
recording artists
will be forever doomed

07:53.348 --> 07:56.018
to a life of only semi-luxury.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.190
Almost there, guys.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.357
Ow.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.235
Why the hell did you tell us to
dress nice to take us out here?

08:05.360 --> 08:07.946
Because, Token, we have to take
pictures for our album cover.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.781
The key to a hot-selling
Christian rock album

08:09.907 --> 08:11.742
is a flashy,
inspirational album cover.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.827
Wow! Neato!
An album cover!

08:13.952 --> 08:15.662
This Christian album
better make as much money

08:15.787 --> 08:18.165
as you said it would, tubby.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.250
I'm going to kill you one day,
Token.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.294
What did you say?
- Nothing! All right, guys.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.921
Stand over there
and look wholesome and cool.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.840
I have a timer on this thing
so I can get in the shot, too.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.842
Cheese!
- No, no, no!

08:28.967 --> 08:30.511
Haven't you guys ever seen
an album cover?

08:30.636 --> 08:32.262
You're supposed to be standing
in random places,

08:32.387 --> 08:34.723
looking away
like you don't care.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.810
Cheese!
- No, Butters!

08:38.936 --> 08:40.395
You can't look happy
on an album cover!

08:40.521 --> 08:41.980
That's not cool!
- Oh.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.899
Token, look away to the right.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.692
More.
More!

08:45.817 --> 08:47.486
Why the hell would I be looking
way over there?

08:47.611 --> 08:49.071
So it looks like
you're too cool to care

08:49.196 --> 08:51.073
that you're on an album cover,
you black asshole!

08:51.198 --> 08:52.699

09:25.190 --> 09:26.608
Thanks for releasing them to us,
Detective.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.985
Sorry for all the trouble
they caused.

09:28.110 --> 09:28.986
It's all right.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.737
I think these boys learned
their lesson.

09:30.862 --> 09:31.655
Boy, I'll say.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.490
If you parents will just step
over here,

09:33.615 --> 09:36.285
you can pay their $400 release
and penalty fees.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.496
$400 just for downloading
some songs off the Internet?

09:39.621 --> 09:40.831
It's not that big a deal.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.292
Not a big deal, huh?!

09:43.417 --> 09:46.086
Come with me.
I'm gonna show you something.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.756
And I don't think
you're gonna like it.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.384
Ugh, dude, I can't wait
to just go back home

09:52.509 --> 09:53.552
and get back to band practice.

09:53.677 --> 09:54.886
Mrph.
- No!

09:55.012 --> 09:56.471
Didn't you guys learn anything?

09:56.597 --> 09:58.515
Look, if we make an album,
all that's gonna happen

09:58.640 --> 10:01.018
is people are gonna steal <i>our</i>
songs for free off the Internet.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.144
We won't make a dime!

10:02.269 --> 10:03.145
Oh, yeah.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.689
Until we get people to stop
downloading music for free,

10:05.814 --> 10:07.566
I say we refuse to play!

10:07.691 --> 10:08.609
Mrph!

10:08.734 --> 10:11.111
Tom, I'm standing in South Park,
Colorado,

10:11.236 --> 10:14.114
where the rock band Moop
has refused to play!

10:14.239 --> 10:17.284
The strike started yesterday and
could go well into next week!

10:18.201 --> 10:19.620
Oh, hey, guys.
How's it going?

10:19.745 --> 10:21.705
We're not letting you back
in the band, Cartman. Fuck off.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.707
I don't want to be
in your crappy band, guys.

10:23.832 --> 10:24.875
I just wanted to let you know

10:25.000 --> 10:27.336
the album for my Christian
rock band, Faith + 1,

10:27.461 --> 10:28.837

10:29.421 --> 10:30.964

- That's right.

It's just a matter of time,
my friends.

10:42.768 --> 10:43.935
This weekend is Christfest,

10:44.061 --> 10:46.313
the single largest gathering
of Christians in the Midwest,

10:46.438 --> 10:48.857
each one of them a walking,
praying wallet full of cash.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.525
And I'll be there
selling my album.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.694
You'll never get a platinum
album doing Christian rock!

10:52.819 --> 10:55.238
It was a stupid idea then,
and it's a stupid idea now!

10:55.364 --> 10:57.366
Yeah! You don't even know
anything about Christianity!

10:57.491 --> 10:59.201
I know enough to exploit it.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.037
Just get that 10 bucks ready,
Kyle. Ta-ta.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.038
Go ahead!

11:03.163 --> 11:04.122
People will just download
your songs

11:04.247 --> 11:05.582
for free on the Internet
anyways!

11:05.707 --> 11:07.918

11:20.889 --> 11:22.516
Yes, it's really
the best Christian album

11:22.641 --> 11:23.850
that's ever been produced,
actually.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.144
Ooh! This would be great
for my grandchildren.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.690
They need hip, cool music,
but with inspirational lyrics.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.025
I think that's what the whole
world needs. Praise Christ.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.903
We're not really Christian.
We're just pretendin' we are!

11:36.697 --> 11:39.241
Butters, remind me later
to cut your balls off.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.992
All right, everyone!

11:41.118 --> 11:44.996

12:17.779 --> 12:19.865

faith in Christ.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.075
Yeah, we prove that
Christian music can be tough

12:22.200 --> 12:23.076

Yeah, it's tough.

14:20.944 --> 14:21.862
But it's times like these

14:21.987 --> 14:23.613
that you see what your band
is made of.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.157
We've got to fight through
the rough times, like Journey.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.159
Tom, we're now entering
the second day

14:28.285 --> 14:30.370
of the rock band Moop's
refusal to play

14:30.495 --> 14:33.874
and the second day of absolutely
no other news to report on.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.710
In a recent poll, we asked
people if Moop's refusal to play

14:36.835 --> 14:39.421
would stop them from downloading
music off the Internet.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.507
1% percent said yes, 2% said no,

14:42.632 --> 14:45.886
and 97% said,
"Who the hell is Moop?"

14:46.011 --> 14:47.262
Back to you, Tom.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.765
Hey, are you the guys protesting
free Internet music downloading?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.184
Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!
- That's right.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.896
Metallica is behind you dudes
1,000%!

14:56.021 --> 14:57.981
We're gonna sit here
and protest with you

14:58.106 --> 15:00.400
until free downloading stops,
yeah!

15:00.525 --> 15:03.570
Tom, it appears now
the musicians strike is growing!

15:03.695 --> 15:06.573
As I'm speaking,
more musicians are arriving!

15:06.698 --> 15:08.408
It looks like Alanis Morissette,

15:08.533 --> 15:11.077
Blink-182, Britney Spears,
and dozens of others

15:11.202 --> 15:13.997
are going to join Moop
in not playing music.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.833
This is a veritable
Strike-apalooza!

15:23.048 --> 15:25.258
Guys, we here at Faith Records
were very moved

15:25.383 --> 15:26.927
by your performance
at Christfest.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.845
You're one of the most talented
Christian rock bands

15:28.970 --> 15:30.305
we've ever heard!

15:30.430 --> 15:31.973
Thank you so much.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.059
Christ has really blessed us
with talent.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.518
Yeah!

15:35.644 --> 15:37.395
We just had one question,
though.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.648
We were looking over
some of your lyrics.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.901
Uh, "I want to walk hand in hand
with Jesus

15:43.026 --> 15:44.611
on a private beach for two.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.865
I want him to nibble on my ear
and say, 'I'm here for you."'

15:48.990 --> 15:52.118
It -- It seems you <i>really</i> love
Christ.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.662
Yes, we sure do.

15:53.787 --> 15:58.917
No, but I-it appears you are
actually in love with Christ.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.669
Well, what are you saying?

16:00.794 --> 16:02.754
That -- That you don't really
love Christ?

16:02.879 --> 16:04.756
Well, of -- of course I do.
I mean, I just --

16:04.881 --> 16:06.257
Well, what's the difference?
You love Christ.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.343
You're in love with Christ.
I mean, what the heck is this?!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.512
We just like to make sure
the bands we sign

16:10.637 --> 16:12.681
are in it for God
and not for the money.

16:12.806 --> 16:13.974
I resent that, sir.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.018
I have never in my life done
anything just for the money.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.021
If I'm lying, may the Lord
strike me down right now.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.024
Uh-oh.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.401
That's all we needed to know.

T-This is for real!

that we forgot to just play!

18:26.731 --> 18:29.442
But why play if we're not gonna
make millions of dollars?

18:29.567 --> 18:31.152
Because that's
what real artists do.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.113
People are always gonna find
a way to copy our music

18:33.238 --> 18:34.280
and swap it for free.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.366
If we're real musicians,
then we should just play

18:36.491 --> 18:38.159
and be stoked that so many
people are listening.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.662
Besides, maybe our songs would
have gotten downloaded for free.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.663
But if they were good songs,

18:41.788 --> 18:42.956
people still would've bought
tickets

18:43.081 --> 18:44.124
to see our band in concert.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.084
From now on,
Moop isn't about money.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.585
Moop is about music!

18:47.710 --> 18:50.672
We're not striking anymore!
Who's with us?!

18:51.840 --> 18:52.924
We're just about the money.

18:53.049 --> 18:53.842
Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:53.967 --> 18:54.884
Yeah.

18:55.009 --> 18:55.885
Oh.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.804
So, dude, what are you gonna do
about your bet with Cartman?

18:57.929 --> 18:58.972
Are you gonna pay him?

18:59.097 --> 19:00.306
I don't have a choice, dude.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.142
I'm gonna swallow my pride,
face Cartman,

19:02.267 --> 19:03.977
and say, "Congratulations.
You were right."

19:04.102 --> 19:05.478
And I'm gonna give him the $10.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.314
And hopefully he won't make
a big deal out of it.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.658
Welcome! Welcome, everyone!
Please enjoy!

19:18.783 --> 19:20.326
The presentation should begin
shortly.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.870
Cartman, what the hell
is all this?

19:21.995 --> 19:23.997
Our platinum-album ceremony.
I've spared no expense.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.665
But you spent all the money
we made!

19:25.790 --> 19:27.792
We're Faith + 1, Token.
There'll be plenty more money.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.544
Relax and enjoy, black asshole.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.879
There's hors d'oeuvres
and drinks

19:31.004 --> 19:32.213
by the Ferris wheel, everyone!

19:32.338 --> 19:35.425
Oh, Kyle! Guys!
So nice to see you!

19:35.550 --> 19:36.926
Let's just get this over with,
Cartman.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.219
You won the bet.
Here's $10.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.513
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not yet, Kyle. Hold on.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.765
Everyone? Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

19:42.891 --> 19:45.268
Whoo-hoo! Faith + 1!

19:45.393 --> 19:47.270
We love you! Praise Christ!

19:47.395 --> 19:48.813
Yes, yes. Thank -- Thank you.
Praise Him.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.940
I think we're ready
to start now.

19:52.483 --> 19:56.905
Welcome to the presentation
ceremony for Faith + 1!

19:58.865 --> 20:02.327
And now to present the award,
here is Michael Collins!

20:02.452 --> 20:04.078
This is the worst day
of my life.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.331
Ah.
This is the best day of my life.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.709
Boys, in recognition of over
one million records sold,

20:09.834 --> 20:12.170
the Christian recording industry
is pleased to present you

20:12.295 --> 20:14.297
with this myrrh album.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.218
Thank you very -- myrrh album?

20:18.343 --> 20:19.886
I thought albums went
either gold or platinum.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.763
No, no, in Christian rock,
our albums go gold,

20:21.888 --> 20:23.306
then Frankincense, then myrrh.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.474
Congratulations!

20:24.599 --> 20:25.225
Ha!

20:25.350 --> 20:26.809
Our bet was you would get
a platinum album,

20:26.935 --> 20:27.936
not a myrrh album!

20:28.061 --> 20:30.063
I don't owe you anything,
fat boy!

20:30.188 --> 20:31.731
You mean I can never get
a platinum album

20:31.856 --> 20:32.815
with a Christian rock band?

20:32.941 --> 20:34.484
No, but you can go double myrrh.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.154
God damn it!

20:39.864 --> 20:41.449
Oh, please don't take
the Lord's name in vain.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.325
Who cares?!

20:42.450 --> 20:44.285
I can never win my bet
because you stupid assholes

20:44.410 --> 20:45.787
don't give out platinum albums!

20:45.912 --> 20:47.163
But you've spread the word
of the Lord.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.665
You've brought faith in Jesus.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.250
Oh, fuck Jesus!

20:52.835 --> 20:53.878
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure

20:54.003 --> 20:55.880
you shouldn't say the "F" word
about Jesus.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.382
Yeah.
You're gonna hurt the band.

20:57.507 --> 21:00.051
Who fucking cares, Token?
I can never beat Kyle now!

21:00.176 --> 21:02.345
I'll say it again!
Fuck Jesus!

21:02.470 --> 21:05.056
My ears are bleeding!

21:05.181 --> 21:07.433
Good job, dick head!
You lost the entire audience!

21:07.558 --> 21:10.019
Aw, fuck you, Token,
you black asshole!

21:10.144 --> 21:11.521
Aah! Oh!

21:11.646 --> 21:13.815
Ugh!

21:18.236 --> 21:20.113
Hmm.
Guess he got what he deserved.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.626
Fuck you, Eric.
