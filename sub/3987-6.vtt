12:48.080 --> 12:49.605
She won't last out there.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.491
If the desert doesn't get her,
Rudy will.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.045
PUPOK: Helena,

13:21.120 --> 13:23.407
did you hear the one
about the pregnant girl

13:23.480 --> 13:25.403
who fell down in the desert?

13:27.320 --> 13:28.560
HELENA: Leave me be.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.246
PUPOK: The only reason
you're alive is because of me.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.721
- Get up!
- I have no strength.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.280
It's not exhaustion that stops you,

13:37.360 --> 13:40.409
you regret leaving Sarah behind.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.686
Don't you?

13:42.040 --> 13:43.610
I regret nothing.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.808
Why are you lying here, then?

13:45.880 --> 13:48.042
Because your sister is
more important than your baby?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.326
No.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.842
- (PUPOK GRUNTS)
- Because I am hungry.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.769
What was done
to Sarah Manning last night?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.843
You have to ask Dr. Coady,
I wasn't there.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.844
Since when are you left out
of the medicine?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.241
She's the boss,
she shares what she wants.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.406
Look, you were gone for months, Paul.

14:25.480 --> 14:26.561
Things changed.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.880
How?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.006
When I left, we were trying

14:30.080 --> 14:31.286
to cure six soldiers.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.169
When we were still Stateside,
maybe a month after you left,

14:36.240 --> 14:37.526
Rudy came back from leave with a girl.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.241
She was sick...

14:39.320 --> 14:40.526
MAN: Hey, Doc.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.403
Bloodshot eyes, dizzy.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.561
Coady treated her.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.244
- On base?
- I didn't think much of it.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.163
But after that, the science took a turn.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.130
Things got more secretive.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.687
The boys were told to record
their intimate contacts.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.650
You mean take hair samples.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.007
Which I test for genetic precursors.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.809
Coady says it's for security purposes.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.245
But you know that's not true.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.442
I think she's getting baseline numbers,

15:04.520 --> 15:05.851
before pictures.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.604
- Before what?
- I don't know.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.728
A different team follows up.
I don't have access.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.006
In her quarters,

15:14.080 --> 15:16.003
that's where she keeps that material.

15:23.680 --> 15:27.048
I understand that
you've been missing work,

15:27.120 --> 15:28.610

15:33.680 --> 15:34.886

15:35.120 --> 15:36.326

that we are here to help.

at Mrs. S's house.

some amazing technology here

help us learn more, okay?

so I don't want any quivering.

it's gonna be her.

When we first met
out in the field at that bar,

17:11.040 --> 17:12.280
I had no idea.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.010
Ah, we were both undercover soldiers,

17:19.280 --> 17:20.645
Yeah, well, I had help.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.885
You brought Sarah Manning in.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.126
I was with Rudy.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.085
It was either take her or terminate.

Well, you know, in high school
we all called you "Jay-Jay",

25:39.400 --> 25:41.129
All the science, bag it, it's evidence.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.446
It's also the cure for the boys.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.010
We need to make sure that moves forward.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.286
We will.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.801
Where's Coady right now?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.042
<i>Confined to quarters,
camp's on lockdown.</i>

25:49.120 --> 25:51.043
Only people out are guys I trust.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.168
<i>Good. Here's what's gonna happen now.</i>

25:53.720 --> 25:55.563
You'll need a formal removal
of command order

25:55.640 --> 25:56.846
and an extraction team.

25:56.920 --> 25:57.967
Yeah.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.646
<i>I will camp out at the director's
office until he sees me.</i>

26:00.720 --> 26:01.926
<i>Now, best case,</i>

26:02.640 --> 26:04.404
<i>I can have a team there in six hours.</i>

26:04.480 --> 26:06.050
Can you keep a lid on things until then?

26:06.360 --> 26:07.407
No sweat.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.608
<i>CASTOR boys are not gonna
take this sitting down.</i>

26:09.680 --> 26:10.727
Are they all accounted for?

26:10.800 --> 26:12.484
There's one patrol still out.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.726
Rudy.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.246
You leave him out there.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.526
You don't need that trouble, Paul.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.724
<i>Six hours. Hang in there.</i>

26:34.200 --> 26:36.680
SCOTT: Okay, quick.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.686
Hello, Rachel.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.966
Fft...

26:48.520 --> 26:49.726
Fft...

26:50.280 --> 26:51.611
Yeah, fft you, too.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.245
You know, it's funny.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.731
Your hand was a lot steadier

26:57.800 --> 26:59.450
when you were jamming that
needle into my neck, wasn't it?

26:59.920 --> 27:01.445
No, no, no. Let's stay here, shall we?

27:02.960 --> 27:04.405
You're not allow...

27:05.200 --> 27:06.326
- BOTH: Allowed.
- Yeah.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.606
- Here.
- FELIX: And you know what?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.171
If you tell anyone about it,

27:09.240 --> 27:10.571
I'm gonna come back,
and I'm gonna harass you

27:10.640 --> 27:11.846
every day.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.004
I want you to tell me
what you know about CASTOR.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.004
CASTOR. Hmm.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.606
R... R... Rumors.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.089
- Rumors.
- No. No, no, no.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.685
Not rumors, they're very real.

27:23.760 --> 27:24.886
And they've taken Sarah,

27:24.960 --> 27:26.849
so I need you to tell me
where they took my sister.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.126
(CHUCKLES)

27:28.240 --> 27:29.446
Is that funny to you?

27:30.480 --> 27:33.450
Well, let's see what we can do
about that, shall we?

27:33.520 --> 27:34.567
Just stop.

27:34.640 --> 27:35.687
Rachel's gonna get a bit of a makeover.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.807
- Ain't she?
- Stop.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.041
- Felix!
- FELIX: What?

27:38.120 --> 27:39.804
I think this is
just what the doctor ordered.

27:39.880 --> 27:40.927
- Stop!
- Yes.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.570
Do you want to see how pretty you look?

27:45.400 --> 27:46.640
Aren't you beautiful?

27:47.160 --> 27:50.084
- Scott, get Dr. Nealon.
- FELIX: Tell me what you know.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.640
No one is coming for you!
Do you understand?

27:52.720 --> 27:54.643
Because no one cares!

27:54.720 --> 27:56.210
I'm not going to help you

27:56.280 --> 27:58.487
- if you humiliate me.
- Humiliate you?

27:58.560 --> 28:00.164
I haven't even gotten started.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.924
Why don't we go for a spin? Shall we?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.525
SCOTT: Felix, we really should go.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.683
And maybe then she'll tell me
where my sister is!

28:07.600 --> 28:09.489
(YELLING) Where did they take her?

28:10.880 --> 28:14.805
Get me out of this place.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.720
Felix, let's go.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.845
(SOBBING)

28:41.840 --> 28:43.365
DONNIE: You sure about this, Ali?

28:43.440 --> 28:45.761
- You hate Bubbles.
- I hate the way my mother runs it,

28:46.280 --> 28:48.362
but when we own it,
we'll run it differently.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.008
- As a drug front.
- Yes.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.165
ALISON: Are we in this together or not?

28:53.240 --> 28:54.685
- DONNIE: Yeah.
- Good.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.446
Oh, shit.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.451
Your mother's store.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.210
Yes, you remembered.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.131
I remember the stock room.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.683
- Really? Why? What happened there?
- (ALISON CLEARS THROAT)

29:06.840 --> 29:09.161
ALISON: Okay, let's go inside.
We should go in.

29:09.240 --> 29:11.049
Yeah? Good, good. Okay.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.966
Come on in.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.328
Feel free to explore. Oh, we have

29:17.440 --> 29:20.205
my mother's new men's line.
It's Minty Gleam.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.846
It's her original recipe, but we'll
probably update it with a little musk...

29:24.920 --> 29:26.684
Okay, Jason doesn't need
to know about the musk.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.205
We do the musk part.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.965
This is just a courtesy visit,
so you can see the business.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.326
You're not gonna
let go of this, are you?

29:32.400 --> 29:35.324
No, no. I mean, this is a
very reputable local business.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.767
- Yeah.
- Eleven years of clean books.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.969
Good storage, centrally located
for distribution.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.927
I mean, you've seen how quickly
we can move product.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.207
So with Bubbles,
the sky would be the limit.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.286
Selling soap.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.606
It's perfect.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.285
(LAUGHS)

29:55.560 --> 29:57.449
I was supposed to have children.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.245
It was expected of me.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.526
Hey.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.804
You've been through a lot recently,

30:05.880 --> 30:09.123
you don't have to make sense
of it all right now, okay?

30:11.320 --> 30:13.766
Part of me feels relieved, Cosima.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.164
Does that make me a monster?

30:16.800 --> 30:18.040
No, honey.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.726
So far from that.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.970
Shall we get you home?

30:26.520 --> 30:27.931
- All set.
- Okay.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.806
DELPHINE: Cosima.

30:35.480 --> 30:36.686
I miss you.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.845
RUDY: When? Yeah.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.485
Yeah, I'm on it.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.806
(PHONE BEEPS)

30:54.880 --> 30:56.723
There's a situation back at base.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.006
What kind of situation?

31:00.120 --> 31:01.451
We're needed.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.051
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

31:33.960 --> 31:35.371
Hey, come in.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.886
Damn.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.606
What is it?

31:39.720 --> 31:42.929
I was coming here
to tell you that I thought

31:43.000 --> 31:45.128
maybe we should slow things down.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.126
Oh.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.491
But now that I see you,

31:50.560 --> 31:53.689
I just kinda wanna make out for, like,
seven hours straight.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.886
Do you wanna talk about it?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.450
Mmm, yeah. After, after.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.446
(PHONE VIBRATING)

32:08.320 --> 32:10.004
- See, this is my life right now.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.326
Shit.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.168
You’re just gonna lose patience with me.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.326
I guess we'll see.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.441
Dude?

32:18.520 --> 32:19.965
Cosima, the book...

32:20.120 --> 32:21.565
Uh, Duncan's book,

32:21.960 --> 32:24.201
with all the weird symbols and stuff.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.405
I think Rachel knows the code.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.168
Human sterilization trials.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.005
Dr. Silva says you haven't shown

32:35.080 --> 32:36.730
any of the same symptoms
as the other women.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.364
Did you love Beth, Paul?

32:42.200 --> 32:43.406
What?

32:43.960 --> 32:45.166
Did you love her?

32:46.560 --> 32:48.369
What happened to Beth...

32:50.400 --> 32:52.129
I will carry that with me forever.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.045
We were looking for a cure

32:55.520 --> 32:56.965
and we thought Dyad had answers.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.171
I wanna talk to Coady.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.851
Give us a minute.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.441
You gave me Rudy's blood. Why?

33:15.520 --> 33:17.841
Temperature's down, no hemorrhaging.

33:17.920 --> 33:21.129
- Remarkable.
- So you knew I'd beat it. How?

33:22.320 --> 33:25.403
Because CASTOR and LEDA
have the same disorder.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.764
It attacks the boys' brains,

33:27.840 --> 33:29.410
the women's epithelial tissue.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.810
But as your fertility proves, Sarah,

33:33.240 --> 33:35.288
you're somehow able to fight it off.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.283
You're infecting innocent women with it.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.885
To understand it.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.805
I didn't put it in the boys.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.246
I just found it.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.487
So, it's engineered.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.324
Who engineered it? Was it Duncan?

33:45.400 --> 33:46.606
It's a weapon.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.125
You're field testing it.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.686
You wanna isolate it

33:50.040 --> 33:51.769
to develop it in other forms.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.046
It could end wars

33:53.200 --> 33:55.089
in a single generation

33:55.160 --> 33:56.491
without spilling a drop of blood.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.044
So who wants it?

33:59.880 --> 34:01.086
Who is it for?

34:10.960 --> 34:12.928
- Where's Rudy?
- He set out on foot.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.560
I lost contact.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.246
The hell's going on here?

34:19.320 --> 34:21.163
Major Dierden has command.
The camp's on lockdown.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.402
- You're confined to quarters.
- That's bullshit.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.686
Hey!

34:38.080 --> 34:39.286
(SIGHS)

34:39.920 --> 34:41.126
(GRUNTING)

35:02.760 --> 35:03.966
Brother.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.089
Paul and Sarah are still out there.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.761
We need to go.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.251
Help is coming.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.765
You're still trying to save them.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.729
- None of this is their fault.
- MARK: (WHISPERING) Major.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.326
Major.

35:18.720 --> 35:21.041
Patrol came back, without Rudy.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.170
I checked the sat phone,

35:23.480 --> 35:25.164
and, Major, they got a call
from Arlington.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.686
(PHONE RINGING)

35:36.920 --> 35:38.490
Paul, what's your status?

35:38.560 --> 35:39.766
PAUL: <i>That depends on you.</i>

35:40.200 --> 35:41.725
<i>Extraction team's en route.</i>

35:42.720 --> 35:44.370
Rudy's patrol is still out.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.928
<i>And we can't reach their sat phone.</i>

35:47.840 --> 35:49.524
Well, good.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.366
<i>That's what we want.</i>

35:54.200 --> 35:55.406
Is there a problem?

35:56.520 --> 35:58.568
No, sir. We'll be waiting.

36:01.720 --> 36:02.960
We have to go.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.127
Go back to your quarters.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.282
You never spoke to me,
do you understand?

36:06.360 --> 36:07.566
MARK: Sir.

36:09.680 --> 36:10.886
Make this right.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.561
(BOTH GRUNTING)

36:39.640 --> 36:40.971

36:45.160 --> 36:46.400
(NECK SNAPPING)

36:52.320 --> 36:53.526
Shit.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.811
Paul! No.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.327
Let's go.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.050
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Let's go.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.480
PAUL: It's this way.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.769
Through here. Through here.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.406
Hey. What are you doing?

37:25.200 --> 37:27.282
This tunnel comes out of a garage.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.408
You take a jeep. Go north-west.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.531
Paul, I'm not leaving without you.
Open the gate.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.689
Listen to me, open the gate!

37:35.960 --> 37:37.166
Paul.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.165
It was never Beth I loved.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.406
SARAH: Paul.

37:51.680 --> 37:52.886
Paul!

38:04.080 --> 38:05.366
SARAH: What kinda guy are you?

38:05.440 --> 38:07.010
- What kinda guy am I?
- Yeah.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.482
PAUL: <i>You know what kinda guy I am.</i>

38:19.080 --> 38:21.162
COADY: First thing, secure the science.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.046
(GUN COCKS)

38:37.640 --> 38:39.608
Does he know what he's done
to those women?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.810
I know exactly what I do, sir.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.086
Rudy.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.522
Your devotion to my boys was pure, Paul.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.205
I could always count on it.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.726
Cure them, Virginia.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.046
Drop the rest.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.929
The science in this room

39:06.000 --> 39:08.731
could rewrite the very nature
of humankind.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.891
You ask me to turn my back on it?

39:15.600 --> 39:16.806

39:24.800 --> 39:26.006
I'm sorry, Paul.

39:26.760 --> 39:27.966
