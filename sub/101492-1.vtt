02:05.798 --> 02:07.298
Keep 'er steady, Willy!

02:07.498 --> 02:10.281
Bastard's driving like a bloody madman.

02:11.781 --> 02:13.692
Beast of a storm brewing up out there.

02:13.892 --> 02:17.563
Perhaps a sign of God's distaste
at the injustice being served here.

02:17.763 --> 02:21.349
An innocent man shouldn't be
subjected to this <i>cruelty.</i>

02:21.549 --> 02:25.517
If I here one more word about you being
a so called 'innocent man',

02:25.517 --> 02:29.266
young Mr Whittock, I'll shove this
pipe so far up your back crack

02:29.266 --> 02:31.965
you'll burn your bastard tongue
chewing me 'baccy.

02:32.765 --> 02:35.494
Innocent! How do you figure that?

02:35.794 --> 02:37.700
You admit to murdering the bugger,

02:37.900 --> 02:39.678
they caught you in the act, Mr Whittock.

02:39.878 --> 02:40.961
I never said I killed a man.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.927
I said I killed a monster.

02:43.127 --> 02:46.271
That transformed into a man
after he was deceased.

02:46.471 --> 02:46.975
Yes!

02:46.975 --> 02:50.175
Yes, yes. Very convenient,
this monster of yours

02:50.175 --> 02:52.617
appeared as a man to everybody else.

02:52.817 --> 02:54.245
Just in time for the Lord and Lady

02:54.445 --> 02:58.290
to discover you'd decapitated their
youngest and most beloved nephew.

02:58.490 --> 03:00.287
The thing was going to
tear me limb from limb,

03:00.487 --> 03:01.599
I had no choice.

03:01.799 --> 03:03.438
That boy was a bloody pansy.

03:03.638 --> 03:05.776
But he wasn't a boy when I killed him.

03:05.976 --> 03:09.270
I don't know how to explain it,
but I know what I saw.

03:09.470 --> 03:12.285
What else do you suggest
gifted me this vile injury?

03:12.485 --> 03:14.763
Rambunctious lover, no doubt.

03:14.963 --> 03:16.636
A woman, did this to me?

03:16.836 --> 03:19.368
I've had far worse done to
me in the throes of passion.

03:19.568 --> 03:23.537
Almost lost me left bollock during
a vigorous affair with Druscilla Douglas.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.727
God rest her soul.

03:24.927 --> 03:28.231
Went blind with syphilis a month later,
and fell down a wishing well.

03:28.431 --> 03:32.009
She'd have to be pretty giant with the
claws of a lioness to do this.

03:32.209 --> 03:35.899
Well, you're an ugly git, Whittock,
and no doubt she was a bit of a gargoyle.

03:35.899 --> 03:37.163
We'll see what the judge has to say.

03:37.363 --> 03:39.910
Judge Thaddeus is a cruel
and impatient man.

03:40.110 --> 03:43.079
He shan't be doing with
your whingeing lies.

03:43.279 --> 03:45.525
I have all the papers signed
by all the witnesses.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.663
Tomorrow morning, you'll hang.

03:47.863 --> 03:50.059
And I'll be glad of the peace and quiet.

03:50.259 --> 03:51.357
Me too.

03:51.557 --> 03:53.490
From this wicked world.

03:55.790 --> 03:57.354
Why the devil have we stopped?

03:59.854 --> 04:03.315
- Willy!
- The horses are spooked, counsellor.

04:03.515 --> 04:04.669
They won't go on.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.579
Well, whip the bastards
until they're unspooked,

04:07.579 --> 04:10.155
or I'll be forced to come up there
and give you a whipping meself.

04:10.355 --> 04:13.098
I've got a court appearance
to attend tomorrow.

04:13.298 --> 04:15.249
The storm is getting worse, sir.

04:15.449 --> 04:17.523
We must seek shelter for the night.

04:19.822 --> 04:22.439
Let's continue at dawn, when it's safer.

04:22.639 --> 04:24.405
There's nowhere to stay, Willy.

04:24.605 --> 04:28.277
I know these woods, sir.
There's an old inn, not far.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.937
We turn off here.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.363
Better to get there before dark, sir.

04:32.563 --> 04:36.343
Folks have been known to go missing,
whole groups of 'em.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.035
Oh, very well.

04:39.335 --> 04:40.705
Onwards!

05:14.120 --> 05:16.420
No funny business from you.
You understand?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.371
Thankyou.

05:25.971 --> 05:28.385
Best kept in a safe place,
don't you think?

05:45.585 --> 05:47.856
Jesus! You're a welcoming fellow.

05:49.556 --> 05:52.397
My name is Parish Councillor
Horrace Raycraft.

05:52.597 --> 05:55.298
This here is my coachman, Willie Ryder,

05:55.298 --> 05:57.091
and this snivelling delinquent

05:57.291 --> 06:00.526
is a criminal I'm escorting
for his court trial.

06:00.726 --> 06:04.103
The storm's preventing us
travelling any further tonight,

06:04.303 --> 06:06.531
so we was hoping you could
give us accommodation.

06:06.731 --> 06:08.692
Three rooms, is it?

06:08.892 --> 06:11.596
Just the two.
This one stays with me.

06:11.796 --> 06:15.215
I can't sleep chained to you,
you smelly old bastard.

06:16.215 --> 06:18.470
Please stop doing that.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.030
What's his crime?

06:21.230 --> 06:22.264
Murder.

06:22.664 --> 06:24.156
Self defence.

06:24.356 --> 06:27.294
Tomorrow, he'll be executed.

06:27.494 --> 06:30.207
Until then, he's my responsibility.

06:30.707 --> 06:34.659
I suppose you want to
come into the warm.

06:34.859 --> 06:38.085
Wipe your boots on the way in.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.383
Jesus, Willie. Look at this wallpaper.

06:52.583 --> 06:56.008
I've left patterns in me chamber pot
less grotesque than this.

06:57.008 --> 07:00.115
Open a window every once
in a while, do you old chap?

07:01.215 --> 07:02.722
Let the odour escape.

07:06.622 --> 07:08.903
Aha! Unexpected guests.

07:09.103 --> 07:12.649
I'm Martha Hogwood.
Welcome to The Three Claws.

07:12.849 --> 07:17.748
Horrace Raycraft. And this here
is my coachman, Willie Ryder.

07:17.948 --> 07:19.303
<i>Willie</i> Ryder?

07:19.503 --> 07:21.956
Why, yes. He's the finest in the County.

07:23.156 --> 07:27.177
Pleasure, gentlemen. Now don't
let brother scare you off, will you.

07:27.177 --> 07:29.177
He's a little mentally impaired.

07:29.177 --> 07:31.405
Hadn't gone unnoticed.

07:31.605 --> 07:33.292
Vincent and I manage
the inn together.

07:33.492 --> 07:36.522
It's been our family business
for generations.

07:36.722 --> 07:40.650
And a very fine establishment
it is too, Miss Warthog.

07:40.850 --> 07:42.847
- Hogwood.
- Precisely.

07:43.047 --> 07:46.852
Well, I'll show you up to our guest
rooms if you'd care to follow.

07:47.052 --> 07:51.213
Oh, Vincent. You'll take care
of their horses, won't you?

07:51.213 --> 07:54.766
The horses. Yes.

07:54.966 --> 07:56.412
Put 'em in the stable out back.

07:56.512 --> 07:57.701
I can do that, madam.

07:57.701 --> 08:00.970
No, no. It's no trouble.
Vincent can manage.

08:01.170 --> 08:03.740
Vincent can manage.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.213
Come on up.

08:06.913 --> 08:10.658
You haven't seen a young lady on your
travels, have you anywhere, gentlemen?

08:10.858 --> 08:15.912
One of our guests left this morning,
without settling her debt.

08:16.112 --> 08:18.692
Haven't passed a soul
I'm afraid, madam.

08:23.592 --> 08:26.275
I'm afraid we're almost full tonight,
but you're in luck.

08:26.275 --> 08:28.024
Just the two rooms for us.

08:28.024 --> 08:30.134
This murdering scoundrel stays with me.

08:30.334 --> 08:31.297
Murdering?

08:31.497 --> 08:34.753
It's incredibly brave of you
to keep youself attached

08:34.953 --> 08:38.687
to a potentially violent criminal,
Mr Raycraft.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.513
Call me Horrace, please.

08:42.712 --> 08:45.186
One must be very courageous
in this profession,

08:45.386 --> 08:48.677
protecting vulnerable ladies,
such as yourself

08:48.877 --> 08:52.486
from the many vulgar
miscreants of society.

08:52.686 --> 08:56.764
I'd be worried he'd sever my
arm from body, and escape.

08:56.864 --> 08:57.524
What's that?

08:57.724 --> 09:00.706
Wouldn't be difficult. Dislocate
the hand, from the wrist,

09:00.906 --> 09:03.124
in the night, while you were sleeping.

09:03.824 --> 09:07.254
Here. Perfect lodgings,
for your coachman.

09:12.254 --> 09:14.710
I'm afraid the bed's a tad lumpy

09:14.910 --> 09:17.223
since our last guest, Lady Stillinfleet

09:17.423 --> 09:19.963
died in her sleep of a perforated bowel.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.100
Thankyou madam.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.640
We have the Reverend Pankhust of Hilperton
staying just across the hall.

09:34.340 --> 09:39.106
Oh yes. We're very particular about our
guests here at The Three Claws.

09:39.806 --> 09:41.185
Oh, Millie!

09:41.385 --> 09:43.040
Ola here, Miss Hogwood.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.795
Shut the peasant door, ya daft wench.

09:45.995 --> 09:48.379
Oh, Jesus Christ!

09:48.579 --> 09:51.932
You've got mess all
over the bed sheets.

09:54.532 --> 09:57.874
Minnie is our resident Lady of the Evening.

09:58.074 --> 10:00.923
Available to our guests
at just two pounds a night.

10:01.123 --> 10:03.718
Minnie, this is Mr Raycraft.

10:03.918 --> 10:06.791
Parish Councillor Raycraft.

10:06.991 --> 10:08.844
You like what you see, Councillor?

10:09.544 --> 10:14.384
I'll admit, I got more than a
slight tingle in me nether giblets.

10:14.584 --> 10:18.976
Maybe Minnie can give you
some relief, later tonight, no?

10:19.176 --> 10:20.576
Please don't.

10:20.776 --> 10:23.441
I'm sure that can be arranged.

10:23.641 --> 10:26.507
This is your room,
at the end of the hallway.

10:46.603 --> 10:49.603
Here. Take this.
Hide it with the rest.

10:52.703 --> 10:53.684
Victoria hasn't returned.

10:53.884 --> 10:57.425
She's not coming back.
Something must have happened.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.353
God help her. She'll never
make it back now.

10:59.553 --> 11:03.763
There are bad things in the woods, Jane.
We should have gone with them.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.276
So what am I to do?
I can't go out there!

11:05.476 --> 11:09.049
You promised to leave before
the blood moon. It's almost dark.

11:09.249 --> 11:10.481
I can't, Minnie.

11:10.681 --> 11:13.476
The're three clouds.
We'll not be safe tonight.

11:13.676 --> 11:15.828
They've planned to have
the inn filled with guests,

11:15.828 --> 11:17.224
on the night of the blood moon.

11:17.424 --> 11:19.069
as if their lives depended on it.

11:19.269 --> 11:22.395
Whatever they're up to, I know
it can't be good.

11:23.095 --> 11:26.416
The new guests!
They brought transportation.

11:26.416 --> 11:27.437
You could help me steal it!

11:27.437 --> 11:30.560
He's the Parish Councillor.
You will be arrested for thievery.

11:31.260 --> 11:34.916
If I'm to believe what you say,
perhaps I've no other choice.

11:35.116 --> 11:36.452
Believe me Jane.

11:37.652 --> 11:39.177
For his sake.

11:54.177 --> 11:55.877
Have they been dealt with?

11:56.277 --> 11:58.364
Under shelter for now.

11:59.064 --> 12:02.120
He's the Parish Councillor, Martha.

12:02.820 --> 12:05.064
They're expecting him
in court tomorrow.

12:05.564 --> 12:08.435
He's not some low-life
people easily forget.

12:08.635 --> 12:12.309
What do you suggest we do then, brother?
We cannot break our pact.

12:12.509 --> 12:13.862
They'll come looking for him.

12:14.062 --> 12:15.666
The inn must be full.

12:15.866 --> 12:18.843
These fools are a gift
from the storm.

12:19.043 --> 12:22.481
Wheel their carriage into a
ditch, and burn it.

12:22.681 --> 12:24.927
Make it look like they've
steered off the road.

12:25.127 --> 12:27.847
Nobody will suspect us.

12:28.047 --> 12:28.917
And the horses?

12:29.117 --> 12:32.509
Perhaps they'll serve as an appetizer.

12:40.909 --> 12:42.698
Jane! Quickly!

13:36.398 --> 13:38.087
A night with the girls!

13:39.987 --> 13:41.730
A night with the girls!

13:43.030 --> 13:45.022
Bring in the girls!

13:57.422 --> 13:59.153
What madness is this?

13:59.353 --> 14:02.736
Get out of my face,
you filthy drunken pig!

14:02.936 --> 14:03.989
You grumpy git, you!

14:06.503 --> 14:10.976
Cheer up. Have a drink.
Get settled in for the storm.

14:10.976 --> 14:15.015
- Ahh, she's a brutal bitch.
- And a blood moon to go with her.

14:22.515 --> 14:24.631
All the devil's ingredients

14:24.831 --> 14:29.067
for an evening of sinister and
supernatural happenings.

14:29.267 --> 14:31.690
Pour youself summat strong boys,

14:31.890 --> 14:34.218
and pray we make it
through 'til morning.

14:34.418 --> 14:37.864
I'll be surprised if he makes it
through the next ten minutes.

14:38.064 --> 14:41.156
So, wrinkles. You got a name?

14:41.356 --> 14:42.005
Horrace.

14:44.405 --> 14:45.866
Horrace, the hideous!

14:47.166 --> 14:49.136
I'm Bernard Bagley.

14:49.336 --> 14:52.336
And this is the Reverent
Gerbert Pankhurst.

14:52.536 --> 14:54.465
Aye. Of Hilperton.

14:56.565 --> 14:58.364
And what about your attachment?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.690
Archibald Whittock.

15:00.890 --> 15:02.417
Charged with murder.

15:02.617 --> 15:07.418
Tomorrow, he'll be sentenced,
to death.

15:07.618 --> 15:11.994
Then you should drink, boy.
Celebrate your last night of living.

15:12.194 --> 15:15.561
Do you always get this drunk,
Mr Bagley?

15:15.761 --> 15:18.099
I have to, on a night
like these, son.

15:18.299 --> 15:19.754
Calms me nerves.

15:19.954 --> 15:21.878
Frightened of a little storm, are ye?

15:22.078 --> 15:25.521
It's not the storm that frightens me.
It's what's out there.

15:25.821 --> 15:26.907
In them woods.

15:27.107 --> 15:28.748
You don't know where you are.

15:29.348 --> 15:30.656
Do ye lad?

15:30.856 --> 15:35.146
This is Grittleton Marsh.

15:35.346 --> 15:40.291
And there are legends,
of Grittleton Marsh.

15:40.491 --> 15:43.887
It's ancient woodlands which
spread for miles.

15:44.087 --> 15:47.252
And the wicked beasts who dwell within.

15:47.452 --> 15:50.384
Seen one, I did. When I was
just a short lad.

15:50.584 --> 15:53.537
Out of my left eye, it was the
last thing it ever saw.

16:00.037 --> 16:03.033
They're out there.
Wolves like you ain't never seen.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.649
Tall as men, and strong as giants.

16:05.849 --> 16:08.117
Wolves, you say?

16:08.317 --> 16:12.784
Not just any wolves. Foul beasts crawled
up from the gizzards of hell.

16:12.984 --> 16:16.752
What a load of superstitious codswallop!

16:16.752 --> 16:18.311
I said I seen 'em, sir!

16:18.511 --> 16:20.211
Through the bottom of a bottle.

16:20.411 --> 16:24.528
There may well be wolves in these parts,
but not as you describe 'em.

16:24.728 --> 16:29.138
The only thing dangerous within fifty
miles is this murdering ratbag.

16:29.338 --> 16:33.348
And I've got him under
<i>my</i> guardianship.

16:34.848 --> 16:38.379
Then here's to you, brave sir.

16:55.860 --> 16:59.633
Sleep tight, Councillor.

16:59.833 --> 17:04.318
Sweet dreams, Councillor.

17:04.518 --> 17:08.477
Sleep tight, Councillor.

17:10.577 --> 17:14.925
Sleep tight, Councillor.

17:30.770 --> 17:33.770
The Councillor wants to see
you in his room tonight.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.040
I've already taken payment.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.385
Ah ah! You'll get your half tomorrow.

17:38.585 --> 17:39.799
Now make sure you wear him out.

17:39.999 --> 17:43.306
I need every man in this inn
sleeping like the dead.

17:43.506 --> 17:46.256
But it's so late Miss Hogwood.
Maybe jenger now.

17:46.456 --> 17:49.005
Don't forget who's keeping a
roof above your head,

17:49.205 --> 17:52.155
you ungrateful gutter whore.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.616
Now do as you're told!

17:53.816 --> 17:56.667
The only reason why men
come to this pig pen

17:56.867 --> 17:58.591
is to spend a night with me!

17:58.791 --> 18:03.335
So perhaps, it is I keeping a
roof over <i>your</i> head.

18:03.535 --> 18:07.262
You know tonight's a special night, Minnie.

18:07.462 --> 18:11.156
We pay you well to draw 'em in,
do we not?

18:11.356 --> 18:13.477
Was that not the arrangement?

18:16.577 --> 18:18.837
Everything must go according to plan.

18:19.037 --> 18:22.972
Otherwise you will not like
the repercussions.

18:24.972 --> 18:26.746
D'you gon scare me.

18:27.446 --> 18:29.669
It's not me you need to be afraid of.

18:57.555 --> 18:59.555
Go on, luvvy.
Like you mean it!

19:00.755 --> 19:04.116
Yeah. Yeah! Yeah!
That's the spot, darlin'!

19:04.316 --> 19:05.895
That's it! Ohh!

19:06.495 --> 19:08.419
Jesus! Ohh!

19:15.919 --> 19:17.066
Yeah!

19:17.266 --> 19:19.000
Ooh! Yeah!

19:20.000 --> 19:22.034
Ooh! God! Yes!

19:22.234 --> 19:25.540
Yes! Yes! Yes!

19:25.740 --> 19:28.895
Yes! Yes! Ooh!

20:22.629 --> 20:24.629
Oh, Jesus Christ!

20:25.829 --> 20:28.512
Stop your moanin' and go to sleep.

23:45.379 --> 23:47.379
You rusted me saw.

23:47.579 --> 23:50.428
It's hardly getting through the bone.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.858
Well, you could've put
your back into it.

23:52.058 --> 23:55.195
I am woman. I am.

24:01.777 --> 24:03.277
Pass me the head.

24:04.377 --> 24:07.789
Don't let it drip everywhere.
You're gonna stain the furniture.

24:12.389 --> 24:13.434
What's that noise?

24:13.634 --> 24:15.390
Somebody's there!

24:18.490 --> 24:20.436
Lord, look upon me with eyes of mercy,

24:20.636 --> 24:23.196
may your mighty power flow into
every inch of my body,

24:23.396 --> 24:24.396
and into the depths of my soul.

24:24.596 --> 24:27.306
Guide me, and give me strength to
make it through this dark night.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.887
Somebody's awake.

24:44.087 --> 24:46.654
Did they see us?

24:56.754 --> 24:59.477
Ahh, Miss Hogsbottom.

24:59.677 --> 25:02.538
Absorb me
in your pillowy bosom.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.038
Mr Raycraft! Mr Raycraft!
Wake up!

25:08.238 --> 25:12.248
Arr! Snuck in for a ride
on old horny Horrace,

25:12.448 --> 25:14.294
have you, you saucy minx!

25:21.094 --> 25:25.118
Jesus wept!
Your breath stinks like piss!

25:25.318 --> 25:27.807
Please, Mr Raycraft, listen.
It's the innkeepers.

25:28.007 --> 25:29.725
They've killed Willie.
Butchered him!

25:29.725 --> 25:30.548
Butchered?

25:30.748 --> 25:32.277
They intend to murder us all.
I heard it.

25:32.477 --> 25:34.720
They're chopping the
guests into pieces.

25:37.020 --> 25:38.427
What the bloody hell!

25:38.627 --> 25:40.738
Was you known rascal.
You're trying to escape!

25:40.938 --> 25:43.253
No! I mean, yes, I was, but...

25:43.453 --> 25:45.313
Right. That does it.

25:51.013 --> 25:53.660
Woah. You dirty little bastard!

25:53.860 --> 25:55.694
It wasn't altogether pleasant
for either of us.

25:55.894 --> 25:57.132
I warned you!

26:01.032 --> 26:02.528
Now shut-up old man,
and listen.

26:02.728 --> 26:03.451
Now calm down.

26:03.651 --> 26:07.133
I saw with my own eyes, those incubus
dismembering your coachman.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.922
And plotting aloud to do
the same to us.

26:08.922 --> 26:09.805
Poppycock!

26:09.805 --> 26:10.859
Go and see for yourself.

26:11.059 --> 26:13.832
I am not lying, sir.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.885
Dismembered, you say?

26:16.785 --> 26:19.853
And you, came back
to warn me, did you?

26:20.053 --> 26:22.804
It's an unlikely story.

26:23.004 --> 26:25.307
Just because it's an unlikely story
doesn't mean it isn't the truth.

26:25.507 --> 26:29.955
Promise to believe me, or I'll go ahead
and prevent your suffering.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.066
It is the merciful thing to do.

26:32.066 --> 26:34.323
Woah, woah, woah, woah.
Hold your giblets.

26:34.523 --> 26:37.578
Just, pass me the gun, lad.

26:37.778 --> 26:40.529
We'll go and see if Willie
really has been murdered.

26:41.729 --> 26:42.644
Fine.

26:43.944 --> 26:45.706
But I'm keeping the gun.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.184
Oh, you bugger!

27:36.374 --> 27:38.674
Vincent, what'd you do with the head?

27:40.174 --> 27:41.932
I thought you had it.

27:42.132 --> 27:45.104
I told you to chuck it in after the legs.

27:57.839 --> 27:59.439
Aargh!

28:00.439 --> 28:01.997
Shh!

28:02.697 --> 28:04.283
Did you hear something, brother?

28:04.483 --> 28:06.829
Upstairs.

28:10.929 --> 28:14.437
Was there something you needed,
Mr Raycraft?

28:18.037 --> 28:19.272
Miss Hogwood.

28:20.872 --> 28:23.940
I'm placing you, and your brother,

28:23.940 --> 28:26.609
under arrest for... for murder.

28:27.009 --> 28:31.556
And I must insist that you
come peacefully with me.,

28:31.756 --> 28:33.364
to the magistrate's court

28:33.564 --> 28:35.938
immediately, or I'll have no choice

28:36.138 --> 28:39.582
or I'll have no choice but to use...
deadly force!

28:39.782 --> 28:43.986
And how do you plan to take
us away, Mr Raycraft?

28:44.186 --> 28:46.226
We've butchered your horses,

28:46.426 --> 28:48.604
murdered your coachman,

28:48.804 --> 28:51.893
and there's no getting
away from this recluse

28:52.093 --> 28:54.266
tonight nor any night!

28:56.866 --> 28:58.547
The gun, Archie!

29:00.247 --> 29:01.673
Quickly man!

30:02.833 --> 30:06.633
Jesus, woman. You could have had
my bloody head off with this.

30:13.773 --> 30:14.773
Get off me!

30:14.973 --> 30:17.318
You fucking mad wench. Get off!

30:43.947 --> 30:45.527
Shoot her Archie!

30:45.727 --> 30:48.425
Get this mad bitch off me!

30:51.525 --> 30:53.525
No! Her!

30:54.525 --> 30:55.592
Sorry!

31:25.730 --> 31:28.230
Come here, sweetness.

31:28.430 --> 31:31.383
We're dismembering the guests.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.470
What's all this bastardin' racket?

31:44.670 --> 31:47.173
I'm totally shagged, and I've barely
had an hour of me beauty sleep.

31:49.373 --> 31:50.377
Fine.

31:50.577 --> 31:51.811
Be as loud as you want.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.935
But I'm leavin' this stinkhole
first thing in the morning.

32:43.591 --> 32:44.691
Archie!

32:47.891 --> 32:50.128
Archie! Where's me pistol?

32:56.828 --> 32:58.836
Help me untie these knots!

33:01.836 --> 33:03.352
Sorry, lad.

33:19.752 --> 33:20.828
Thank you.

33:21.028 --> 33:23.033
I'm sure I'll think of some
way you can repay me.

33:23.233 --> 33:25.499
Actually, I've got something
specific in mind,

33:25.699 --> 33:27.753
which involves all three of us, and

33:27.953 --> 33:30.111
they ropes may come in useful.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.009
Get out of the way.

33:50.009 --> 33:51.454
- Horrace!
- Huh?

33:54.754 --> 33:56.009
Reload!

34:11.208 --> 34:12.884
Hurry up, man!

34:13.083 --> 34:14.405
She's stressing me arms!

34:45.052 --> 34:46.119
Vincent Hogwood,

34:46.319 --> 34:49.434
I am placing
you under arrest.

34:50.134 --> 34:52.164
Archie! Tie him up!

35:03.864 --> 35:05.393
What'd I miss?

35:11.593 --> 35:13.358
These two scoundrels

35:13.558 --> 35:16.764
thought they could get away,
with murderin'

35:16.964 --> 35:19.284
every last one of us

35:19.484 --> 35:21.042
in our sleep.

35:21.242 --> 35:23.465
For what reason exactly,

35:23.665 --> 35:25.915
I only shudder to imagine.

35:26.115 --> 35:29.835
Luckily, I saw through their
dastardly scheme,

35:30.035 --> 35:34.417
almost the minute I stepped through
the doors of this unholy hovel.

35:34.617 --> 35:39.513
All evening I lay in wait to
outsmart this foolish pair,

35:39.713 --> 35:42.375
and when I heard a disturbance
in the night,

35:42.575 --> 35:44.831
I did what I had to.

35:45.031 --> 35:48.162
I saved every single one of us

35:48.862 --> 35:51.354
from certain death.

35:52.754 --> 35:54.532
You didn't save your coachman, though.

35:54.732 --> 35:56.409
That done chopped him up into pieces.

35:56.609 --> 35:59.968
Aye. Chopped to pieces.

36:00.168 --> 36:04.541
Well. Yes. I had to confirm me
theory was correct.

36:04.741 --> 36:06.319
But now you've got no coachman.

36:06.519 --> 36:08.824
Alright Windy Wallets.
Let's not interrupt.

36:09.024 --> 36:11.313
You owe me your lives,
that's what matters.

36:11.513 --> 36:14.440
You're all gonna die, Councillor.

36:14.640 --> 36:18.499
A far more grisly and
petrifying death

36:18.699 --> 36:21.811
than what my sister and
I would've granted you.

36:22.711 --> 36:26.258
You don't know what you've done.

36:26.458 --> 36:28.980
You do not frighten us, Mr Hogface.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.677
It's not me you need to fear.

36:31.877 --> 36:34.494
All our lives, my sister and I

36:34.694 --> 36:36.722
have kept an agreement,

36:36.922 --> 36:40.034
an agreement with the vicious
beasties of these woods.

36:40.234 --> 36:42.293
Unlike any creature

36:42.493 --> 36:45.328
you've ever
seen or heard of, Councillor.

36:45.528 --> 36:49.211
Half man, half wolf.

36:49.411 --> 36:53.153
All bloodthirsty rage.

36:53.353 --> 36:56.498
For generations we've kept a pact

36:56.698 --> 36:58.446
that's protected us.

36:58.646 --> 37:02.136
A truce between man and monster.

37:02.336 --> 37:03.948
What sort of pact?

37:04.148 --> 37:07.180
Every blood moon, when the inn is full,

37:07.380 --> 37:09.531
we make an offering.

37:09.731 --> 37:12.026
All the guests of The Three Claws,

37:12.226 --> 37:14.990
all the low-lifes and drunkards,

37:15.190 --> 37:17.505
hiding from their damnable pasts.

37:17.705 --> 37:20.370
They all die at our hands.

37:20.570 --> 37:25.022
Till the next blood moon,
the beasts leave us in peace.

37:25.722 --> 37:28.929
Well, how often's a blood moon?

37:29.129 --> 37:31.265
- Well, every four years.
- Six, seven months.

37:31.465 --> 37:33.604
It's a small price to pay

37:33.804 --> 37:36.281
for a life free of fear or dread

37:36.481 --> 37:38.911
of being disembowelled by their claws

37:39.111 --> 37:41.589
or devoured by their teeth.

37:41.789 --> 37:45.036
Well, we have Willie.
We have your sister.

37:45.236 --> 37:46.383
There's an offering.

37:46.383 --> 37:47.468
It's not enough.

37:47.668 --> 37:49.860
Six bodies for three beasts.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.522
That's the deal.

37:51.722 --> 37:53.669
There's three of these savages?

37:53.869 --> 37:56.630
And you'd better not let
them go hungry.

37:56.830 --> 37:58.782
Well, there's you.
That takes it up to three.

37:58.982 --> 38:01.478
They'll come here with a vengeance.

38:01.678 --> 38:05.865
Well, perhaps it's all just deluded
superstition, Mr Hogwood.

38:06.065 --> 38:10.742
You and your sister are a
truly demented duo.

38:10.942 --> 38:14.693
Perhaps there's no other explanation
for your bloodlust.

38:14.893 --> 38:18.128
What if he's telling the truth, Horrace?
What if they <i>are</i> out there?

38:18.328 --> 38:20.214
I've seen 'em. They exist!

38:20.414 --> 38:24.309
Then we send an offering, like he says.
And pray it will suffice.

38:25.009 --> 38:26.005
Fine.

38:39.657 --> 38:43.057
You can chop her into bits, and we'll
make the bloody offering.

38:46.557 --> 38:47.713
Do it, man!

38:47.913 --> 38:50.537
Not me own sister, Councillor. Please.

38:50.737 --> 38:52.059
Do as he says, Vincent.

38:54.659 --> 38:57.338
I'm sorry, Martha.

39:20.633 --> 39:21.633
Ewww.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.234
Thank God you found us, sir.

39:30.734 --> 39:32.347
We couldn't have left the rest of you.

39:32.347 --> 39:33.000
Here.

39:36.700 --> 39:38.347
This might sting.

39:41.147 --> 39:42.535
Sorry. Sorry.

39:43.935 --> 39:45.812
It's alright. It's alright.

39:58.124 --> 39:59.124
Thank you.

39:59.324 --> 40:00.526
For taking care of me.

40:00.726 --> 40:02.189
It's the least I could do, sir.

40:02.389 --> 40:04.757
Archie. Whittock.

40:04.957 --> 40:07.219
- Jane.
- It's a pleasure.

40:10.119 --> 40:12.325
What are they going to
do to him down there?

40:12.525 --> 40:14.407
I'm not sure. Arrest him?

40:14.407 --> 40:15.482
They should kill him.

40:15.682 --> 40:17.210
Like he killed those horses.

40:18.310 --> 40:20.275
- What?
- There's no way of escaping here.

40:20.475 --> 40:22.697
We will have to wait until morning.

40:22.897 --> 40:24.322
And head out on foot.

40:24.522 --> 40:25.956
Where're you heading off to?

40:26.556 --> 40:27.970
She's on the run.

40:30.370 --> 40:31.448
From who?

40:31.648 --> 40:33.333
If you don't mind my asking.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.547
My parents.

40:37.247 --> 40:38.364
Those who know me back home.

40:45.564 --> 40:48.087
Archie... if I show you something,

40:48.287 --> 40:49.730
would you promise to
keep it a secret?

40:49.930 --> 40:52.326
- Jane, no!
- I can trust him, Minnie.

40:52.526 --> 40:54.523
Perhaps he can help us.

40:54.723 --> 40:55.810
You have my word.

41:22.110 --> 41:24.944
My God. It's yours!

41:25.144 --> 41:27.549
He is. His name's Edgar.

41:27.749 --> 41:29.368
Well, what's he doing in
the bloody wardrobe?

41:29.568 --> 41:32.225
Hiding. No inn would have me.

41:32.425 --> 41:33.873
Not with Edgar.

41:34.073 --> 41:36.205
And I can't risk anyone finding us.

41:36.405 --> 41:37.497
Or follow us.

41:37.697 --> 41:38.788
Where's his father?

41:39.888 --> 41:41.058
There's no father.

41:41.258 --> 41:43.689
Just a cruel man from
a cruel night.

41:44.189 --> 41:45.064
Men!

41:55.064 --> 41:56.702
I never asked for this child, Archie.

41:57.402 --> 41:58.869
Now that I have him,

41:59.569 --> 42:01.566
nobody's gonna come
between us.

42:04.366 --> 42:05.687
He's all I have.

42:06.787 --> 42:08.798
Shh shh shh. It's alright.

42:08.998 --> 42:10.287
It's alright, mummy's here.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.446
Shh shh shh. It's alright.

43:23.471 --> 43:26.771
Please forgive me,
O mighty beast,

43:26.971 --> 43:30.554
for this is all I could bring,
O ancient one.

43:31.254 --> 43:34.015
The inn is full as you
commanded,

43:34.215 --> 43:37.476
but these guests are not
so easy to kill.

43:37.676 --> 43:39.450
I am old, master.

43:39.650 --> 43:42.600
And we have
served you for many years.

43:42.800 --> 43:45.805
But I can't deliver on
our promise.

43:46.505 --> 43:48.968
Go! Feast on them!

43:49.168 --> 43:51.272
Take our inn for yourselves.

43:51.472 --> 43:54.312
But I beg of you.
Spare me!

43:54.512 --> 43:56.009
Please, spare me!

43:59.609 --> 44:02.142
Have mercy, master!

44:05.642 --> 44:08.174
Have mercy, God!

44:30.374 --> 44:32.262
I don't think he's
comin' back.

44:32.762 --> 44:34.959
Be that you, Mr Hogwood?

44:36.359 --> 44:38.607
Did they accept me offerin'?

44:42.307 --> 44:44.798
Oh, that'll be a 'no',
I reckon.

44:52.220 --> 44:53.620
Run, men!

44:56.820 --> 44:59.953
We meet again!
Bastard hound of Satan!

45:01.153 --> 45:02.615
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

45:05.515 --> 45:07.570
Oh. Oh, bugger that!

45:12.570 --> 45:14.260
More over the hearth!

45:45.975 --> 45:47.175
It's not going to hold!

45:48.575 --> 45:50.184
Take cover lads!

46:32.210 --> 46:33.410
What was that?

46:33.610 --> 46:34.994
You stay here.
I'll go and look.

46:35.194 --> 46:36.137
No. I'll go.

46:39.637 --> 46:40.876
Hide the baby!

47:56.014 --> 47:58.314
I think I just shat my pants!

50:15.391 --> 50:16.191
Millie?

50:17.091 --> 50:21.266
Don't... make... a sound.

50:27.266 --> 50:28.656
Hide!

50:28.856 --> 50:30.233
What is it, Millie?

50:30.433 --> 50:33.427
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

51:43.630 --> 51:45.230
Shoot it, Horrace!

52:26.026 --> 52:30.526
Get away from me,
you ugly son of a bitch!

52:36.026 --> 52:39.466
Oh, no no no!
Not my eye!

52:39.666 --> 52:43.010
Oh. Oh, God. No! My eye!

53:46.891 --> 53:48.091
Bernard!

55:13.498 --> 55:14.698
Oh, Bernard!

55:14.898 --> 55:17.016
It's too late. He's gone.

55:17.216 --> 55:19.957
Help me! I'm still alive!

55:21.357 --> 55:24.653
Well... There's nothing we
can do for him now.

55:24.853 --> 55:27.882
Aye. God rest his soul.

55:28.282 --> 55:31.101
Somebody come and shoot
the bloody thing!

55:33.001 --> 55:34.064
Don't!

55:35.864 --> 55:37.568
It'll be suicide.

58:20.388 --> 58:22.936
Eat me! Come and eat me!

58:42.650 --> 58:45.150
It's alright. We're safe in here.

58:46.450 --> 58:47.877
Archie, no!

58:51.777 --> 58:52.853
No!

59:20.830 --> 59:21.830
Archie!

59:30.730 --> 59:31.965
Now we're safe.

59:57.065 --> 59:58.138
What happened to you?

59:58.338 --> 01:00:00.375
Don't... ask.

01:00:56.625 --> 01:00:58.725
What devilry <i>is</i> this?

01:00:58.925 --> 01:01:02.195
Seems Bernard's tall tales
were true after all.

01:01:02.395 --> 01:01:05.181
These were once men.

01:01:12.281 --> 01:01:15.269
There's two dead.
One's still out there.

01:01:15.469 --> 01:01:17.423
No doubt it'll be back to
finish the job.

01:01:17.623 --> 01:01:19.380
And we'll be ready.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.442
Aye.

01:01:22.642 --> 01:01:24.449
Barricade all the doors
and windows.

01:01:24.649 --> 01:01:27.884
If we can make it just one
more hour 'till sunrise,

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.722
'till the blood moon sets,

01:01:29.922 --> 01:01:31.895
then we may survive.

01:01:40.595 --> 01:01:41.518
Minnie?

01:01:44.218 --> 01:01:45.154
Oh God.

01:01:49.154 --> 01:01:50.319
She's gone.

01:01:51.619 --> 01:01:53.649
You did what you could, lad.

01:01:53.649 --> 01:01:56.128
Jane. Oh my God, Jane!

01:02:06.297 --> 01:02:07.197
Jane.

01:02:08.597 --> 01:02:09.698
It's alright. We're alright.

01:02:09.898 --> 01:02:10.829
Thank God.

01:02:11.229 --> 01:02:12.319
Where's Minnie?

01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:16.299
No.

01:02:17.399 --> 01:02:18.495
It got her.

01:02:18.695 --> 01:02:20.983
What the hell is that?

01:02:21.683 --> 01:02:24.647
You can't bring a baby
into a place like this.

01:02:24.847 --> 01:02:26.011
Are you mad, woman?

01:02:26.011 --> 01:02:28.266
I didn't know we'd be set upon
by flesh hungry wolf monsters.

01:02:28.266 --> 01:02:29.051
Werewolves.

01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:30.037
That's what they are.

01:02:30.537 --> 01:02:33.245
Men who turn to beasts under
the spell of the moon.

01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:35.983
That is exactly what I killed
back in Eddington.

01:02:36.183 --> 01:02:37.653
Now do you believe me.

01:02:39.353 --> 01:02:40.859
We need your help lad.

01:02:41.059 --> 01:02:43.972
We need to barricade the place.
They'll be back for us.

01:02:44.472 --> 01:02:45.868
Will you be alright?

01:02:45.868 --> 01:02:47.521
Yes. Go.

01:02:47.721 --> 01:02:49.748
Shout, if you need me.

01:02:55.248 --> 01:02:57.051
Thank you, Archie.

01:04:38.063 --> 01:04:40.208
No! Don't listen, man.

01:04:40.408 --> 01:04:42.410
Let me in!

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:44.566
It's just the walls talking
to you again.

01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:49.535
Let... me... in.

01:04:59.735 --> 01:05:00.708
Bernard?

01:05:04.008 --> 01:05:06.544
Horrace! It's Bernard.

01:05:07.644 --> 01:05:09.241
He's alive!

01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:15.246
He can't be.

01:05:18.846 --> 01:05:20.083
What's happening to him?

01:05:23.483 --> 01:05:24.819
Oh, God!

01:05:25.819 --> 01:05:27.088
He's turning!

01:05:29.988 --> 01:05:31.717
He's become one of them!

01:05:37.917 --> 01:05:39.135
Minnie.

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:42.173
Oh no. Jane's alone up there!

01:05:51.073 --> 01:05:53.292
Reverend. Guard the entrance.

01:06:27.994 --> 01:06:30.994
Bernard! It's me, Gilbert.

01:06:31.194 --> 01:06:32.937
You cannae remember Gilbert!

01:06:34.637 --> 01:06:36.183
Have you come back for your rum?

01:06:38.183 --> 01:06:40.646
You drank it all,
you daft bastard.

01:07:08.406 --> 01:07:09.306
Minnie?

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.980
How is she?

01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:27.357
Incredibly hairy.

01:07:27.557 --> 01:07:29.832
Oh. That don't sound like Minnie.

01:07:43.441 --> 01:07:45.441
Run!

01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:52.430
Over here!

01:08:30.884 --> 01:08:32.184
In here.

01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:41.343
You can hide. They can't reach you
in there. It's too small for them.

01:08:43.143 --> 01:08:44.093
Archie!

01:08:44.493 --> 01:08:46.160
I don't see what choice we have.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.520
Hurry!

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:51.529
Oh my God.

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:12.670
Don't come out 'til both
beasts are dead. Go lad!

01:10:07.106 --> 01:10:10.106
No! Ah! Oh, no no no
no no no no!

01:10:13.706 --> 01:10:17.171
If you're lookin' for your arm,
you just missed it.

01:10:28.571 --> 01:10:29.666
What's that?

01:10:29.866 --> 01:10:32.296
I'm not sure. A mouse?

01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:35.064
It's a big mouse, Archie.

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:36.141
A rat, then?

01:10:36.341 --> 01:10:37.607
It's not a bloody rat!

01:11:03.785 --> 01:11:05.285
That'll learn ya!

01:11:06.885 --> 01:11:09.618
Bitch! Come on! Die!

01:11:09.818 --> 01:11:12.448
And to think I fucked you!

01:11:37.485 --> 01:11:39.785
You're still a filthy
drunken pig.

01:12:33.694 --> 01:12:36.894
It's alright, sweetheart.
Mother will be back soon.

01:13:03.984 --> 01:13:05.084
Archie!

01:13:23.908 --> 01:13:25.008
Thanks.

01:13:33.662 --> 01:13:35.062
No! No!

01:13:35.562 --> 01:13:36.727
Archie!

01:14:54.749 --> 01:14:56.549
Don't you even think about it!

01:14:56.949 --> 01:14:58.470
You big hairy bitch!

01:15:54.034 --> 01:15:55.134
Archie!

01:15:57.834 --> 01:15:59.452
Archie, wake up!

01:15:59.652 --> 01:16:00.946
Wake up!

01:16:01.646 --> 01:16:04.234
We did it.
We got the last one.

01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:05.718
It bit me.

01:16:05.918 --> 01:16:09.245
No no no. You'll be fine.
I'll clean you up.

01:16:09.445 --> 01:16:11.926
I can feel it. The bite.

01:16:12.126 --> 01:16:15.033
The hunger. Controlling me.

01:16:18.233 --> 01:16:19.079
No no no no no.

01:16:19.279 --> 01:16:21.722
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me!

01:16:21.922 --> 01:16:23.139
Don't leave me.

01:16:25.239 --> 01:16:26.584
Don't leave me.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.198
I will strengthen you,

01:17:21.398 --> 01:17:24.142
and help you.

01:17:24.342 --> 01:17:26.708
I will hold you,

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:31.181
with my righteous right hand.

01:17:59.577 --> 01:18:00.477
Archie!

01:18:00.677 --> 01:18:01.590
Archie!

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:03.208
Get back! It's begun.

01:18:05.508 --> 01:18:06.848
I'm sorry, lad.

01:18:07.048 --> 01:18:07.980
No! Don't!

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.769
Look at him! He's been bitten.

01:18:09.969 --> 01:18:11.821
He's gonna turn into
one of they beasts.

01:18:13.421 --> 01:18:15.131
We done what we could.

01:18:16.331 --> 01:18:18.244
Step away from him, Councillor.

01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:21.156
It happened to Bernard.
It happened to Minnie.

01:18:21.356 --> 01:18:22.786
He's gonna slaughter us all.

01:18:22.786 --> 01:18:25.100
I swear I'm gonna blow your
head off if you shoot him.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.145
You'll damn us all!

01:18:26.145 --> 01:18:28.419
No, he's right.
It's alright, Jane.

01:18:28.619 --> 01:18:32.226
I'm turning. I won't be able
to stop myself from killing.

01:18:34.426 --> 01:18:37.111
And when the sun comes out,
see, what then?

01:18:37.311 --> 01:18:39.460
You'll change back.
You'll be Archie again.

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.886
I have no idea.

01:18:42.586 --> 01:18:44.245
I have to find out.

01:18:45.845 --> 01:18:47.365
I know we haven't
known each other long,

01:18:47.565 --> 01:18:50.152
but I'm not ready
to say goodbye.

01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:52.059
Nor I, Jane.

01:18:52.259 --> 01:18:53.888
Oh, Christ.

01:19:00.588 --> 01:19:02.399
It's happening. Go!

01:19:03.199 --> 01:19:04.120
Just don't hurt him!

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.292
Just run Jane.
We've gotta leave this inn.

01:19:21.092 --> 01:19:22.352
Damn ye lad!

01:19:24.052 --> 01:19:25.042
Damn ye!

01:19:33.542 --> 01:19:35.565
Brent! We need to move.

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.938
I'll explain it.
Quick!

01:20:34.555 --> 01:20:37.355
No! Archie, it's us.

01:20:37.555 --> 01:20:39.691
It's me. Jane.

01:20:39.891 --> 01:20:42.936
I know you're in there.
Somewhere.

01:20:43.436 --> 01:20:45.464
Fight it, Archie.

01:20:45.664 --> 01:20:47.668
Remember who you are.

01:20:49.068 --> 01:20:52.011
That's right, Archie. It's me.

01:21:01.941 --> 01:21:04.541
Spirit of Jesus, come upon us.

01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:08.463
Fill us with holy anger.

01:21:09.263 --> 01:21:13.382
Vent us from all desires
that breed violence.

01:21:14.582 --> 01:21:18.661
Compell us with the fury
of your love,

01:21:18.661 --> 01:21:20.161
oh lamb of God.

01:21:20.861 --> 01:21:24.358
Let us be.

01:22:03.995 --> 01:22:05.295
Oh, Archie!

01:22:09.395 --> 01:22:10.452
Jane!

01:22:38.272 --> 01:22:40.272
Promise you'll
write to me, lad.

01:22:40.472 --> 01:22:42.820
Let me know how the two
of you are getting on, will you?

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.112
The three of us?

01:22:44.312 --> 01:22:45.435
Of course we will.

01:22:45.635 --> 01:22:48.261
Anything you want,
just ask old Horrace.

01:22:48.461 --> 01:22:50.150
And on the next blood moon...

01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:51.822
You'll lock me in the County Jail.

01:22:51.822 --> 01:22:53.222
Just for the night, lad.

01:22:53.422 --> 01:22:56.061
That should give those scallywags
a bit of a fright.

01:22:58.461 --> 01:23:01.558
Oh! And before I forget...

01:23:01.758 --> 01:23:05.379
The witness reports and
warrant for your arrest.

01:23:10.979 --> 01:23:12.924
No hard feelings.
