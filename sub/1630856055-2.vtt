WEBVTT

00:09.931 --> 00:13.068
[suspenseful music playing]

00:17.689 --> 00:18.896
[Tyson] Come on, Jarv.

00:18.896 --> 00:21.137
It's time to move
to our new home.

00:26.517 --> 00:28.758
[Tatiana] Shall I go ahead?

00:29.896 --> 00:31.862
[metal clanks]

00:33.793 --> 00:34.965
[Jordan] All right,
let's go trucking.

00:40.172 --> 00:43.482
We're moving, uh, 10 years'
worth of mining operation

00:43.482 --> 00:44.965
in record time.

00:46.172 --> 00:49.000
[Parker] We're moving our yard
and our camp over to Dominion,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.965
but we've spent $15 million
for the ground.

00:53.172 --> 00:56.275
I have no landlord. I can do
it however the [bleep] I want

00:56.275 --> 00:59.172
and life's standing.

00:59.172 --> 01:01.379
[narrator]
Twenty-eight-year-old
Parker Schnabel

01:01.379 --> 01:04.757
is all in on the biggest
gamble of his life.

01:05.516 --> 01:07.896
He bought one of
the last historically

01:07.896 --> 01:11.551
gold-rich pieces of land
left in the Yukon,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.275
Dominion Creek,

01:14.275 --> 01:16.862
and there's no turning back.

01:20.310 --> 01:23.896
Dominion gold is a lot of work
for the next few years.

01:23.896 --> 01:25.827
It's a lot of ground.

01:25.827 --> 01:28.172
I feel a bit nervous
because it...

01:28.172 --> 01:29.793
It's all been so...

01:29.793 --> 01:31.586
It all happened so fast.

01:32.896 --> 01:34.931
[Tyson] We don't really know
what's gonna happen.

01:34.931 --> 01:37.413
I think everyone's really
concerned about that.

01:37.413 --> 01:39.310
And Parker's gotta have
a lot of stress on him

01:39.310 --> 01:41.482
right now and a lot of work
ahead of him.

01:41.482 --> 01:45.275
[suspenseful music playing]

01:48.310 --> 01:50.344
This is getting pretty soft.

01:51.793 --> 01:53.448
[tires whirring]

01:54.103 --> 01:55.000
Yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.172
Gonna need a push.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.275
[engine revving]

02:07.793 --> 02:09.689
[Jordan] Yeah, push, push.

02:10.517 --> 02:11.896
Yeah, it's going.

02:16.689 --> 02:19.689
[narrator]
The potential payout
for Parker's new claim

02:19.689 --> 02:23.068
is a staggering
80,000 ounces of gold

02:23.068 --> 02:26.689
worth $160 million,

02:26.689 --> 02:31.000
but it's known
for not giving up
its treasure easily.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.482
[Parker] Dominion's a creek
that's had a hell of a lot

02:32.482 --> 02:34.310
of mining on it,
but it has killed everybody

02:34.310 --> 02:36.379
that's shown up here
because they've always been

02:36.379 --> 02:38.413
in a huge rush to get gold
out of the ground.

02:38.413 --> 02:41.241
It gets very expensive
very fast.

02:44.689 --> 02:48.067
[narrator] The gold is buried
40 feet deep.

02:48.067 --> 02:50.103
To pull it from the ground,

02:50.103 --> 02:52.172
he'll need to spend
millions on top

02:52.172 --> 02:55.655
of the $15 million
he paid for the claim.

02:56.793 --> 02:59.172
And that's just the start.

02:59.172 --> 03:02.103
Parker's also got access
to mine

03:02.103 --> 03:07.000
untapped virgin ground
on Australia Creek.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.793
[Parker] The last four or
five years, we've had really

03:08.793 --> 03:11.000
good financial security,
but no ground security.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.517
And now we've got really
good ground security

03:12.517 --> 03:15.068
and no financial security.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.241
And that's a little scary.

03:18.793 --> 03:21.068
[narrator] To crack the code
at Dominion

03:21.068 --> 03:24.586
and land a big payday
before going broke,

03:24.586 --> 03:27.448
Parker's in desperate need
of a plan.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.310
What's happening?

03:29.310 --> 03:30.413
Hey, not a whole lot.
How are you?

03:30.413 --> 03:32.586
Oh, I'm doing pretty good.

03:32.586 --> 03:35.067
I know that we have
a lot of things on the go.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.000
We have Australia Creek.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.275
We have Dominion now.

03:39.275 --> 03:40.758
I'm trying to figure out

03:41.413 --> 03:44.586
what the best... way

03:44.586 --> 03:47.067
of dealing
with all of this is.

03:47.067 --> 03:49.103
I don't know
if Dean made much money

03:49.103 --> 03:51.067
throughout the years
or not, honestly.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.379
Um...

03:53.172 --> 03:54.793
I mean, he just made
15 million bucks.

03:54.793 --> 03:55.793
-Yeah.
-[laughter]

03:55.793 --> 03:57.413
Like, there is that.

03:57.413 --> 03:59.172
[Parker] Yeah. Best season
yet was his shortest.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.103
[laughter]

04:01.103 --> 04:04.000
Um, but, uh,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.586
what's killed everybody
is that they've been
in a huge rush.

04:06.586 --> 04:09.068
This property has taken out

04:09.068 --> 04:12.517
a few people and nobody's
really come out of it

04:12.517 --> 04:14.068
very far ahead.

04:14.068 --> 04:15.586
And you're looking
at 40 foot deep ground.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.481
-[Mitch] Oh, wow.
-And on Australia,

04:17.481 --> 04:19.172
some of the holes are
10 feet to bedrock.

04:19.172 --> 04:20.724
So, we can afford to wait

04:20.724 --> 04:22.896
and strip that later.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.689
On Dominion, we're gonna have
to have a lot of work done

04:25.689 --> 04:28.413
before we're washing any rocks
and making any money.

04:28.413 --> 04:31.000
So, I think we should
shift gears,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.379
press pause
on all our other projects.

04:33.379 --> 04:36.172
This is Dean's pit
as of when we took over,

04:36.172 --> 04:38.517
so I think that, like,
just like step one

04:38.517 --> 04:41.103
is to pick up
where Dean left off

04:41.103 --> 04:43.206
and just get those
cuts down to gravel

04:43.206 --> 04:45.413
or something that will
start falling, right?

04:45.413 --> 04:46.689
Yeah.

04:46.689 --> 04:48.000
[Tyson]
Do you have a rough idea

04:48.000 --> 04:49.586
of how much you need
to pull out

04:49.586 --> 04:50.896
or would like to pull
out of the ground

04:50.896 --> 04:52.379
to kind of
keep things floating?

04:52.379 --> 04:54.931
Like, to not
be totally screwed,

04:54.931 --> 04:57.862
we'd need to do
5,000 ounces this season.

04:58.896 --> 05:00.862
And so, where that comes from,
I don't really know.

05:07.379 --> 05:09.586
All right,
well, what's the game plan
for the week then?

05:09.586 --> 05:12.000
[Parker] If we can get
200,000 square feet

05:12.000 --> 05:13.793
in a week,
then we'd be really good.

05:13.793 --> 05:15.275
If you start thinking
about all of it,

05:15.275 --> 05:16.689
-it's an overwhelming...
-[Tyson] Yeah.

05:16.689 --> 05:17.793
-amount of work.
-[Tyson] Let's put on

05:17.793 --> 05:19.068
-those horse blinders.
-[Parker] Yup.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.275
All right. Thanks, guys.

05:20.275 --> 05:21.689
-All right. Yup.
-Thanks, man.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.689
-[Tyson] Let's go do it.
-[Mitch] Yeah.

05:23.689 --> 05:25.517
[Mitch] You know,
we got a game plan now,

05:25.517 --> 05:27.793
but 5,000 ounces might not
sound like a lot of gold

05:27.793 --> 05:29.482
from what we got
in the past,

05:29.482 --> 05:31.275
but with everything
we got going on this season,

05:31.275 --> 05:32.793
that's gonna be a tall order.

05:34.103 --> 05:39.275
[narrator] Dominion Creek
is a massive 7,500 acres,

05:39.275 --> 05:43.241
equivalent to almost
10,000 football fields.

05:45.275 --> 05:47.586
To kickstart the new project,

05:47.586 --> 05:50.000
Parker's tasked Mitch
and Tyson

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
with expanding Dean's old cut

05:54.103 --> 05:56.586
and wants the first
four-and-a-half acre,

05:56.586 --> 05:58.413
40 foot deep section

05:58.413 --> 06:00.482
down to frozen pay gravels

06:00.482 --> 06:02.448
by the end of the week.

06:05.689 --> 06:09.068
[Mitch] All right, let's see
what this place is all about.

06:09.068 --> 06:11.000
Let's get ready
to move some dirt.

06:11.793 --> 06:14.551
[dramatic music playing]

06:17.000 --> 06:19.206
Man, things are changing
around here so quick,

06:19.206 --> 06:21.586
but, uh, just really happy
that Parker

06:21.586 --> 06:23.689
was able to put
this deal together here.

06:23.689 --> 06:25.586
We got some stability now.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.586
I think it's a great
new home for us.

06:28.586 --> 06:30.103
[Tyson]
Parker's given us a week

06:30.103 --> 06:31.620
to get this cut down
to gravel.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.689
I don't know
what you're thinking, Mitch,

06:33.689 --> 06:35.517
but, man,
this is some deep ground.

06:35.517 --> 06:37.000
It's gonna take
a little bit for us

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
to get this out of here.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.379
[Mitch] It doesn't seem
that bad when you're just

06:40.379 --> 06:41.482
looking at it on paper.

06:41.482 --> 06:42.586
But once you come out here

06:42.586 --> 06:43.793
and start moving this dirt,

06:43.793 --> 06:45.379
it's a long way to the bottom.

06:45.379 --> 06:47.172
It's not gonna be easy.

06:47.172 --> 06:49.482
We're in the money pit
right now here

06:49.482 --> 06:51.000
because we're gonna spend
a whole bunch

06:51.000 --> 06:54.172
before we ever see anything
come out of this.

06:54.172 --> 06:56.620
Here's to hoping there's
a hell of a lot of gold here.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.793
Yup. We're, uh, definitely
gonna need

06:58.793 --> 07:00.965
a little bit
to pay the bills now.

07:04.724 --> 07:09.793
[suspenseful music playing]

07:17.103 --> 07:19.275
[Tony speaking]

07:34.379 --> 07:36.172
[narrator]
Two weeks into the season,

07:36.172 --> 07:39.310
King of the Klondike
Tony Beets

07:39.310 --> 07:41.896
has already spent over
a million dollars

07:41.896 --> 07:45.103
stripping overburden
at Paradise Hill

07:45.103 --> 07:48.482
and still isn't on the gold.

07:49.379 --> 07:50.758
[Tony speaking]

07:59.793 --> 08:03.379
[narrator] Tony's lifeline
of an amended water license

08:03.379 --> 08:08.068
allows him to return
to his Indian River claims,

08:08.068 --> 08:11.896
but it would mean moving
his whole operation.

08:11.896 --> 08:14.206
He must now decide
whether to stay

08:14.206 --> 08:17.862
at the hill
or pivot to Indian.

08:20.413 --> 08:22.448
[Tony speaking]

08:35.379 --> 08:37.895
[Monica] It's always good
to head out to the Indian.
I love it out there.

08:37.895 --> 08:39.793
It's beautiful
and it'll be nice

08:39.793 --> 08:41.793
to see what it looks like.

08:41.793 --> 08:43.482
I mean, it's been a few years
since we've been out there,

08:43.482 --> 08:45.793
so hopefully all of our
[bleep] is still out there.

08:47.275 --> 08:49.413
-[Tony speaking]
-Knife?

08:49.413 --> 08:50.689
-Yeah [indistinct]
-For liposuction?

08:50.689 --> 08:51.862
[Tony speaking]

08:57.379 --> 08:58.862
-There you go.
-[Tony speaking]

09:03.275 --> 09:06.275
[narrator] Forty miles south
of Paradise Hill,

09:06.275 --> 09:09.379
Tony's Indian River claim
has over eight miles

09:09.379 --> 09:12.931
of pre-stripped
gold-rich ground.

09:12.931 --> 09:14.655
[Tony speaking]

09:17.586 --> 09:19.379
[narrator] Eight years ago...

09:22.000 --> 09:24.793
[narrator] Tony resurrected
an old dredge

09:24.793 --> 09:26.793
to mine one of the most
lucrative valleys

09:26.793 --> 09:28.379
in the history of the Yukon.

09:28.379 --> 09:30.275
Tony's pretty obsessed
with dredges

09:30.275 --> 09:32.103
because, I mean, they work.

09:32.103 --> 09:34.896
[narrator] Doubling down
on the gold-rich ground,

09:34.896 --> 09:37.275
Tony added
a second wash plant,

09:37.275 --> 09:38.689
a shaker deck.

09:38.689 --> 09:39.655
[Tony speaking]

09:42.586 --> 09:44.000
[Monica] Two hundred.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.103
[narrator]
In just two seasons...

09:45.103 --> 09:47.103
[Tony speaking]

09:47.103 --> 09:48.793
[Mike] I think we will.

09:48.793 --> 09:50.482
[narrator]
His operation pulled in

09:50.482 --> 09:53.620
a massive $10 million
of gold.

09:53.620 --> 09:55.931
Anyway... Holy [bleep].

09:55.931 --> 09:57.482
[laughs]

09:59.000 --> 10:03.413
[narrator] Now, he finally
has the chance to return.

10:03.413 --> 10:06.275
[suspenseful music playing]

10:07.827 --> 10:09.965
[Tony speaking]

10:16.275 --> 10:18.000
[Mike] Yeah. When we left,
we literally just pulled up

10:18.000 --> 10:19.620
our underwear
and [bleep], didn't we?

10:19.620 --> 10:20.586
[Tony] Mmm-hmm.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.551
[Tony speaking]

10:32.482 --> 10:33.896
[Monica]
It's a great picture
of you, Dad.

10:33.896 --> 10:35.896
-The one on the frame.
-What? Yeah...

10:37.413 --> 10:38.896
[Monica laughing]

10:47.068 --> 10:48.586
For a while,
I was living in this camp.

10:48.586 --> 10:52.344
I think I was living
in this room.

10:53.689 --> 10:55.482
Oh, it had a rough life.

10:55.482 --> 10:58.172
And there was an ant colony.
You see all that duct tape?

10:58.172 --> 11:00.000
That was to keep
the ant colony that was living

11:00.000 --> 11:01.620
in between the desk
and the wall

11:01.620 --> 11:03.172
from getting out.

11:03.172 --> 11:05.551
[Kevin speaking]

11:06.586 --> 11:09.448
[Tony speaking]

11:28.000 --> 11:29.241
[man] Uh-huh.

11:29.827 --> 11:31.034
The chutes?

11:31.689 --> 11:33.000
[Tony speaking]

11:33.000 --> 11:33.965
Yeah.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.896
[Tony speaking]

11:47.517 --> 11:49.103
[Mike] And we're gonna be
trying to get a lot

11:49.103 --> 11:51.724
of sluicing done here
as soon as we can.

11:51.724 --> 11:53.758
[Tony speaking]

12:07.310 --> 12:10.448
[suspenseful music playing]

12:17.206 --> 12:19.482
[Ruby] With ten rock trucks,
three excavators,

12:19.482 --> 12:21.758
two G11s and a D6,

12:21.758 --> 12:24.103
like, it is seriously
all hands on deck.

12:24.103 --> 12:27.275
Yeah. We're moving [bleep]
dirt, as Tony would say.

12:27.275 --> 12:28.344
[laughs]

12:29.275 --> 12:30.655
It's chaos.

12:32.172 --> 12:34.172
[Tony speaking]

12:42.103 --> 12:45.000
[narrator] After scouting
his Indian River claim,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.172
Tony is facing a dilemma,

12:48.103 --> 12:51.482
gamble on a move
to the Indian

12:51.482 --> 12:54.586
or stick to the Super Pit
on Paradise Hill?

13:06.103 --> 13:08.896
[Mike] I don't know about you,
but I have nightmares
of mud like this.

13:08.896 --> 13:10.655
[bleep].

13:11.586 --> 13:13.379
[narrator]
As temperatures rise,

13:13.379 --> 13:16.103
the winter snow
and ice flood the cut,

13:16.103 --> 13:19.931
creating a thick
black mud stew.

13:20.482 --> 13:22.068
[Mike] It's sticky,

13:22.068 --> 13:23.482
it's everywhere

13:23.482 --> 13:25.758
and it takes forever
to [bleep] dry.

13:25.758 --> 13:28.482
It makes working
on the hill [bleep].

13:28.482 --> 13:31.965
[suspenseful music playing]

13:36.000 --> 13:38.068
[Tony speaking]

13:54.206 --> 13:55.275
[Mike] Right.
Be there in a sec.

13:56.896 --> 13:57.931
[Tony speaking]

13:59.000 --> 14:00.965
[Mike] You know,
you can always smell it.

14:06.793 --> 14:07.965
[Mike] How much do you want?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.586
Oh, half a pail will do then.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.379
[laughs] Oh.

14:19.068 --> 14:20.103
[Mike] Yeah.

14:20.103 --> 14:21.862
[Tony speaking]

14:23.862 --> 14:27.620
[narrator]
If Tony's hit Paradise's
white channel pastry,

14:27.620 --> 14:30.655
it could swing his decision
to the hill.

14:31.379 --> 14:32.551
[Monica] Hello.

14:33.482 --> 14:34.896
Oh, we're surviving.

14:34.896 --> 14:37.448
[Tony speaking]

14:39.413 --> 14:41.862
I know. I even made sure
there was hot water for you.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.689
You even remember
how to do that?

14:49.689 --> 14:51.275
[Tony speaking]

14:56.896 --> 14:58.931
[suspenseful music playing]

15:07.310 --> 15:09.482
[Tony speaking]

15:11.379 --> 15:12.482
[Mike] That's awesome.

15:12.482 --> 15:13.793
[Tony speaking]

15:13.793 --> 15:15.000
[Monica]
No, that's super promising.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.241
[Tony speaking]

15:46.413 --> 15:48.586
[Zee] Woo! Here we go.

15:48.586 --> 15:49.586
We're back, baby.

15:49.586 --> 15:50.862
Running Monster Red.

15:52.275 --> 15:53.689
Couldn't be happier.

15:53.689 --> 15:56.206
We're running good pay, so...

15:56.206 --> 15:58.413
nothing but up and up
from here.

15:58.413 --> 16:02.517
[narrator] 125 miles
from the Klondike
in Keno City,

16:02.517 --> 16:05.689
Rick Ness is already
on the gold.

16:05.689 --> 16:08.137
[bleep] beautiful day.
Storm's going away.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.586
We're getting gold.

16:11.586 --> 16:13.103
Starting off
with what I'm coming out,

16:13.103 --> 16:14.793
it's incredible,
you know what I mean?

16:14.793 --> 16:17.000
It's been too long
since I've seen gold

16:17.000 --> 16:19.965
in the box, and right now,
we've got that.

16:19.965 --> 16:22.758
[narrator] After going MIA
for over a year

16:22.758 --> 16:24.241
and hitting rock bottom,

16:24.793 --> 16:26.000
Rick's had to sell

16:26.000 --> 16:27.379
his late mom's house

16:27.379 --> 16:29.137
to kickstart his season.

16:31.310 --> 16:34.206
Now he's a man on a mission,

16:34.206 --> 16:38.586
chasing a 1,000-ounce
$2 million dream.

16:38.586 --> 16:41.172
Running old
stockpiled pay dirt,

16:41.172 --> 16:43.172
he needs to net 20 ounces

16:43.172 --> 16:45.275
by the end of the week.

16:45.275 --> 16:46.689
[Rick]
This is a great beginning.

16:46.689 --> 16:48.275
I mean,
I couldn't be happier.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.965
But we're never
gonna get to our goal

16:49.965 --> 16:51.275
with just three people.

16:51.275 --> 16:52.896
I gotta get more people
in here.

16:52.896 --> 16:54.482
So I reached out
to a buddy of mine

16:54.482 --> 16:56.379
and he recommended someone.

16:56.379 --> 16:58.896
They've done a lot of work
in the oil fields in Alaska.

16:58.896 --> 17:00.793
A lot of experience
with big equipment,

17:00.793 --> 17:02.620
so it should work out.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.378
And if it doesn't, they're
gonna be gone by the end

17:04.378 --> 17:06.862
of the week because I'm not
carrying people this year.

17:08.586 --> 17:10.000
-I got faith in you.
-[Morgan] Good.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.068
-[Zee] All right?
-Sweet.

17:11.068 --> 17:12.275
[Zee] All right. Good.

17:18.378 --> 17:20.378
[Morgan] I'm really excited
to be out here with Rick.

17:20.378 --> 17:22.482
I've heard only good things
about him

17:22.482 --> 17:24.172
from our mutual friend,

17:24.172 --> 17:27.862
but it's a little
nerve-wracking knowing

17:27.862 --> 17:31.000
Rick is really relying
on some good help

17:31.000 --> 17:32.620
and me doing it right.

17:32.620 --> 17:36.000
And that's a lot of weight
on my shoulders.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.172
[narrator]
Twenty-eight-year-old
operator Morgan Lauren

17:39.172 --> 17:41.172
has been running
heavy equipment

17:41.172 --> 17:43.448
since she was
eighteen years old.

17:45.793 --> 17:48.379
[Morgan] I'm from Alaska
and I've been up

17:48.379 --> 17:50.965
in the oil field
for like 10 years.

17:50.965 --> 17:54.206
I quit my job
and I'm really risking

17:54.206 --> 17:58.172
being out here and being away
from everything at home.

17:58.172 --> 18:00.379
I grew up gold panning
with my family.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.620
My earliest memory is
in a piece of equipment.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.517
I was maybe four or five
sitting on my grandpa's lap

18:05.517 --> 18:09.172
as he was putting in
an air strip at his house
in the dozer.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.206
I've never worked
on a gold claim before.

18:12.206 --> 18:14.275
I'm hoping to come out of it

18:14.275 --> 18:17.172
where if one day I wanted
to go and open my own claim,

18:17.172 --> 18:19.172
I would be like,
"Yep, I know the steps.

18:19.172 --> 18:21.068
I know what's needed."

18:21.068 --> 18:23.413
And it's evident every single
second I'm out here

18:23.413 --> 18:24.758
how much I have to learn.

18:30.172 --> 18:31.551
Oh, my God.

18:35.206 --> 18:37.137
What's the matter?

18:38.586 --> 18:40.689
This [bleep] is so frozen.

18:40.689 --> 18:42.310
You're just not quite getting
your bucket straight.

18:42.310 --> 18:43.620
That's all.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.068
See how... See how the top

18:45.068 --> 18:46.068
-of that bucket slide?
-[Morgan] Yeah.

18:46.068 --> 18:47.310
[Rick] That's how you want it.
There you go.

18:47.310 --> 18:48.379
Twist it down on the first,

18:48.379 --> 18:49.413
go ahead, move forward.

18:49.413 --> 18:50.344
[Morgan] Okay.

18:51.275 --> 18:52.965
[Rick] Give it some juice.

18:53.896 --> 18:55.896
Whenever your tires
start to spin...

18:55.896 --> 18:57.965
-Yeah?
-Just lift off on the bucket,

18:57.965 --> 18:59.379
-that will put
pressure on them.
-Okay.

18:59.379 --> 19:01.000
So I'm gonna do it on value

19:01.000 --> 19:02.310
and I'll loosen it up
for you, all right?

19:02.310 --> 19:03.862
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

19:19.068 --> 19:21.103
[Zee] It's nice.
I mean, Morgan showed up.

19:21.103 --> 19:23.068
She seems to got
the hang of it already.

19:24.379 --> 19:26.000
She's doing great.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.758
I watched her make her passes.

19:27.758 --> 19:31.172
I'm confident she's, uh,
the right one for the job.

19:31.172 --> 19:33.068
She'll be fine
loading the plant,

19:33.068 --> 19:36.103
just from the little bit
I've been watching, so...

19:36.103 --> 19:38.206
It looks like Rick made
a pretty good choice.

19:38.206 --> 19:40.103
Um, hopefully,
the rest of his choices

19:40.103 --> 19:41.448
are as good as Morgan.

19:43.517 --> 19:46.379
[Morgan]
Operating this loader
is entirely different

19:46.379 --> 19:48.379
than what I've always had
at work

19:48.379 --> 19:50.103
and even laying
around at home.

19:50.103 --> 19:52.172
That thing is
over 40 years old,

19:52.172 --> 19:55.172
and it has definitely
been used and abused.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.275
What the heck?

20:04.379 --> 20:05.862
Hey, Rick. There's no water.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.482
There's no water
at the plant.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.034
[Rick] [bleep].

20:14.896 --> 20:17.172
-What happened?
-There's no water.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.689
-What the [bleep]
is that all about?
-[Morgan] I don't know.

20:19.689 --> 20:21.965
[Rick] All right,
let's just go check the pump.

20:25.896 --> 20:29.172
[narrator] Without water,
Rick can't wash pay dirt

20:29.172 --> 20:31.862
and can't catch gold.

20:33.103 --> 20:36.448
[water pump failing to start]

20:44.862 --> 20:46.931
[bleep], it's killing
the batteries.

20:48.379 --> 20:50.862
Why aren't you starting, pig?

20:53.103 --> 20:54.689
Yeah, I don't know what else
to do besides pulling

20:54.689 --> 20:56.517
the suction basket,
see if it's clogged up.

20:56.517 --> 20:58.379
I don't know
what else it could be.

20:58.379 --> 21:00.862
We need the excavator,
pull it up,
see what it looks like.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.689
I just wanna get
running again.

21:03.689 --> 21:05.896
It's just pissing me off.

21:05.896 --> 21:09.482
If we don't have a water pump,
we can't be sluicing.

21:09.482 --> 21:12.034
That kind of puts us
at a standstill.

21:19.241 --> 21:22.758
[tense music playing]

21:24.344 --> 21:26.379
[Zee] Rick's down by the pump.
I'm gonna come up here

21:26.379 --> 21:28.586
and just make
sure everything's good.

21:28.586 --> 21:32.000
[narrator]
Rick Ness' operation
is at a standstill.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.172
His only pump
for feeding water

21:34.172 --> 21:36.655
to the wash plant
has broken down.

21:37.965 --> 21:39.344
[Zee] Time's a-wasting.

21:40.586 --> 21:42.448
We need to get that pump
up and running.

21:44.793 --> 21:46.586
[Morgan]
I was running the plant

21:46.586 --> 21:48.793
and realized
we don't have any water.

21:48.793 --> 21:51.068
And this is something
that's so simple,

21:51.068 --> 21:54.758
but it ends up being,
you know, make-or-break today.

21:56.379 --> 21:58.172
[narrator]
Every hour they're down

21:58.172 --> 21:59.862
means less gold

21:59.862 --> 22:01.896
and Rick's target
for 20 ounces

22:01.896 --> 22:05.620
by the end of the week
slips further away.

22:07.896 --> 22:09.482
[Rick] I don't know what else
to do besides pull up

22:09.482 --> 22:11.344
the suction basket,
see if it clogged up.

22:12.172 --> 22:13.517
[Morgan] Come up.

22:14.896 --> 22:17.862
[Rick] This is a [bleep] pump.
I do not need it going down.

22:17.862 --> 22:19.965
I mean,
it's an expensive thing, so...

22:19.965 --> 22:21.413
It's just a pain in the ass.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.000
[Morgan] Oh, yeah.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.103
[Rick] That thing
was [bleep] buried.

22:26.103 --> 22:27.655
[Morgan] Dude,
that thing was bad.

22:27.655 --> 22:28.965
[Rick] Buried.

22:30.586 --> 22:33.000
Great. Now, this river
is running really dirty

22:33.000 --> 22:35.137
because of the spring runoff,
so everything's coming down

22:35.137 --> 22:37.482
the river right now,
dirt, sediment, sand.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.344
And they're all getting
caught right here
in our suction hole, so.

22:41.655 --> 22:43.275
All you can do is dig it out

22:43.275 --> 22:45.413
and you clean the dirt off it.

22:48.655 --> 22:51.620
That's what we get for trying
to run this time of year.

22:52.793 --> 22:54.310
And hopefully that's it.

22:56.379 --> 22:57.379
Oh, yeah.

22:57.379 --> 22:58.862
Oh, she got pressure.

22:59.896 --> 23:01.586
Plenty of pressure.

23:01.586 --> 23:03.241
You gotta push on...
Push the button.

23:03.241 --> 23:06.344
[water pump failing to start]

23:13.862 --> 23:15.620
[Rick] [bleep] sake.

23:19.655 --> 23:21.689
I hate pumps.

23:21.689 --> 23:23.689
You know what the...
You know what pumps
have to do?

23:23.689 --> 23:26.172
Water pumps? One [bleep] job.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.896
Pump water.

23:27.896 --> 23:30.551
You know what
they almost never
[bleep] do? Is their job.

23:33.137 --> 23:36.344
For one reason or another,
this [bleep] pump
isn't, uh, priming.

23:37.758 --> 23:40.137
It's probably just got
an [bleep] air lock somewhere.

23:42.034 --> 23:45.344
I'm thinking if we get
the small one

23:45.344 --> 23:47.689
and set it up there
and then open both

23:47.689 --> 23:49.793
top and bottom valves

23:49.793 --> 23:52.172
just to get air and pressure,

23:52.172 --> 23:54.551
'cause that worked
in the oil field.

23:54.551 --> 23:56.482
[Rick] It should...
I mean, if we plumb it
in here, it should...

23:56.482 --> 23:58.103
It should fill that
and then it should back

23:58.103 --> 23:59.655
in air out of this line.

24:04.793 --> 24:06.551
[Morgan] So we think
we had an air lock.

24:06.551 --> 24:08.241
We weren't getting any
suction out of this one,

24:08.241 --> 24:09.655
so we're gonna try,

24:09.655 --> 24:12.172
use the little pump
and hook up over here

24:12.172 --> 24:15.068
and just kind of start
force-feeding water into it,

24:15.068 --> 24:18.275
see if we can get it
flowing again.

24:18.275 --> 24:20.551
[narrator]
Rick's pump sucks water

24:20.551 --> 24:23.620
from the river using
a rotating impeller.

24:24.586 --> 24:27.103
This creates
centrifugal force

24:27.103 --> 24:29.000
that pulls water in

24:29.000 --> 24:30.655
and then pushes it out

24:30.655 --> 24:32.620
towards Rick's wash plant.

24:33.896 --> 24:36.896
But air has caused
a blockage in the pump,

24:36.896 --> 24:38.862
stopping the water flow.

24:40.344 --> 24:43.551
Morgan's plan,
use a second pump

24:43.551 --> 24:46.344
to force more water
into the system.

24:47.275 --> 24:50.137
The extra pressure
should push the air out

24:50.137 --> 24:53.965
and allow the water
to flow to Monster Red.

25:00.068 --> 25:02.448
[machinery whirring]

25:02.448 --> 25:05.758
We've already wasted
most of the day on that, so...

25:06.551 --> 25:08.655
Hopefully this will work.

25:10.275 --> 25:12.034
[Rick] It shouldn't take long.
If it's gonna work,

25:12.034 --> 25:13.793
it's gonna work quick.

25:13.793 --> 25:15.655
We'll know when it takes off.

25:15.655 --> 25:17.137
Fingers crossed.

25:20.758 --> 25:22.000
I think it went.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.275
Yeah, she primed.

25:23.275 --> 25:24.448
That was it.

25:25.241 --> 25:26.965
[Zee] There we go.
There's some water.

25:26.965 --> 25:28.551
Here it comes.

25:29.793 --> 25:32.103
[Rick] So, it ended up
being a fairly easy fix,

25:32.103 --> 25:34.275
but we spent all [bleep]
morning diagnosing it.

25:34.275 --> 25:36.137
That kind of pisses
me off, but...

25:36.137 --> 25:39.551
Either way,
we're gonna get up there,
run it, and get some gold.

25:42.482 --> 25:44.586
[Morgan] Oh, hello, sir.
Would you like a ride?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.034
[Rick] I would love a ride.

25:46.034 --> 25:47.862
[engine revving]

25:55.034 --> 25:57.172
Run it, run it.

25:59.586 --> 26:01.793
-Well, I think you did
a good job today.
-Thanks.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.448
You can stay
at least till tomorrow.

26:03.448 --> 26:06.137
[laughter]

26:07.896 --> 26:09.482
[Morgan]
I'm feeling pretty thankful,

26:09.482 --> 26:11.586
actually, that I took
the risk to come out here.

26:11.586 --> 26:14.482
I'm feeling good in Rick,
I'm feeling confident in him,

26:14.482 --> 26:18.068
and I think this is gonna be
a really good season for us.

26:22.068 --> 26:23.793
[Rick] Been pretty impressed.

26:23.793 --> 26:25.793
Morgan was right there
running through stuff

26:25.793 --> 26:27.896
and helping me getting
that pump going, so...

26:27.896 --> 26:29.551
She's a breath of fresh air,
you know what I mean?

26:29.551 --> 26:30.862
She's a good one.
If I can get a few

26:30.862 --> 26:32.448
more like her, we'll be set.

26:51.379 --> 26:55.172
It's a precarious situation
right at the moment.

26:55.172 --> 26:57.896
We're gonna run
out of money in

26:57.896 --> 27:00.827
about eight to ten weeks.

27:02.689 --> 27:05.689
[narrator] To conquer
his new Dominion Creek claim,

27:05.689 --> 27:08.793
Parker's unleashed
a torrent of cash,

27:08.793 --> 27:11.896
spending $21,000 a day

27:11.896 --> 27:14.379
to strip the first
four-and-a-half acres

27:14.379 --> 27:19.172
of his new money pit
down to pay in just one week.

27:19.172 --> 27:21.172
Parker finally bought us
some ground

27:21.172 --> 27:23.758
and, yeah, we got a lot of it.

27:23.758 --> 27:25.241
[narrator] Three days in,

27:25.241 --> 27:27.586
they've gotten
through half that.

27:27.586 --> 27:31.000
[Stephan] Three more days
to finish this will be...

27:31.000 --> 27:32.482
pretty tight.

27:32.482 --> 27:34.965
But we might make it.

27:34.965 --> 27:37.379
[narrator] Twenty-year veteran
dozer operator

27:37.379 --> 27:40.896
Stephan Larose
is breaking up ground

27:40.896 --> 27:44.000
ahead of the crew in a D11.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.896
Capable of pushing 45 yards
of dirt in every push,

27:48.896 --> 27:51.241
the 850-horsepower,

27:51.241 --> 27:56.000
124-ton monster
is the lead machine

27:56.000 --> 28:00.344
of Parker's money pit
stripping operation.

28:00.344 --> 28:02.620
[Stephan] We're about four
feet depth right now.

28:03.862 --> 28:08.241
It's pulling pretty hard,
but it's the way it is.

28:10.965 --> 28:12.586
Whoops.

28:12.586 --> 28:14.827
Oh, my [bleep].

28:17.379 --> 28:19.620
Hello, Mitch.
You copy, Mitch?

28:20.482 --> 28:22.689
[Mitch] Yeah, go for Mitch.

28:22.689 --> 28:24.379
Hey, Mitch,
I got an oil spring

28:24.379 --> 28:26.655
all over the place
in the back of the cut here.

28:28.172 --> 28:30.551
[Mitch] Well, man,
you're just gonna have
to hang tight there.

28:30.551 --> 28:32.344
[Stephan]
Okay. Thank you. 10-4.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.896
Nothing's easy
on this machine to fix.

28:37.896 --> 28:39.896
I expect major
it's gonna take time

28:39.896 --> 28:41.758
just to get in,
just to get here.

28:41.758 --> 28:43.758
Look where we are.
We're at the end
of the cut too.

28:55.344 --> 28:57.448
You know, I've been working on
equipment for a long time

28:57.448 --> 28:59.172
in the Yukon and this is one
of those things

28:59.172 --> 29:02.482
that you hate to see is

29:02.482 --> 29:05.275
your machinery is about far
away from you as it can be

29:05.275 --> 29:06.965
and then it breaks down.

29:09.241 --> 29:11.896
[narrator] Halfway through
Parker's stripping blitz

29:11.896 --> 29:14.896
in the money pit,
the lead D11 dozer

29:14.896 --> 29:18.620
has gone down in the worst
possible location.

29:21.482 --> 29:23.275
[Mitch] Now I'm having to use
a dozer just to be able

29:23.275 --> 29:25.655
to gain access out here.

29:25.655 --> 29:28.000
Obviously we're not driving
our service trucks back here

29:28.000 --> 29:29.862
to work on this thing.

29:33.655 --> 29:35.000
[Stephan] Hey, Mitch.

29:36.482 --> 29:38.896
Wow, you weren't kidding, huh?

29:38.896 --> 29:40.172
[Stephan]
You see it from there already?

29:40.172 --> 29:41.379
Oh, yeah.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.758
[Stephan] It's this...

29:44.551 --> 29:46.896
[Mitch] Man, that's pretty
wild for that thing to pop
like that.

29:46.896 --> 29:48.000
-[Stephan] Yes.
-[Mitch] Yeah.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.034
Broke the eye right
off the end of it.

29:50.034 --> 29:52.034
[Stephan] Yeah,
broke right off. Mmm-hmm.

29:52.034 --> 29:55.620
Well, we need to figure out
how we're gonna get this
thing outta here.

29:57.344 --> 29:59.586
Right now, we're just
looking at our D11T here

29:59.586 --> 30:01.172
and we broke the barrel off

30:01.172 --> 30:03.000
the end of
the ripper cylinder.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.172
So we gotta get it
swapped out here.

30:05.172 --> 30:09.034
[narrator] Two cylinders power
the ripper up and down,

30:09.034 --> 30:11.275
but one has broken clean off

30:11.275 --> 30:12.586
and must be replaced,

30:12.586 --> 30:15.241
leaving the blades
stuck deep in the mud,

30:15.241 --> 30:17.586
paralyzing the dozer.

30:17.586 --> 30:19.965
[Parker] So it's good to see
my usual good timing

30:19.965 --> 30:21.448
is in full force.

30:21.448 --> 30:22.965
[Mitch] Oh! Yeah.

30:24.586 --> 30:26.344
Heckin' [bleep].

30:26.344 --> 30:27.551
What happened?

30:27.551 --> 30:30.000
[Mitch] Just broke the end
of the rod right off.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.551
We need to try
and get the ripper out

30:31.551 --> 30:33.172
of the ground,
but we're only using half

30:33.172 --> 30:34.551
of the power
that we normally have here.

30:34.551 --> 30:36.793
I can probably just
come in here sideways

30:36.793 --> 30:38.689
and push some of this out
of the way and then get
underneath it.

30:38.689 --> 30:39.724
[Mitch] Okay.

30:40.896 --> 30:41.827
[engine starts]

30:59.275 --> 31:00.827
Come on, come on, come on.

31:01.689 --> 31:02.931
There we go.

31:05.068 --> 31:06.965
Yeah. That'll work.

31:09.241 --> 31:11.689
-Good?
-[Mitch] Thanks, buddy.

31:11.689 --> 31:14.896
Right now, we're just
walking the D11 out here.

31:14.896 --> 31:16.448
Now this is the full
definition

31:16.448 --> 31:18.310
of limping your way home.

31:20.793 --> 31:23.103
[narrator] To get
the D11 back into the cut

31:23.103 --> 31:24.689
as fast as possible...

31:24.689 --> 31:25.965
Just put it right there.

31:25.965 --> 31:27.793
[narrator]
Mechanic Jordan Sands

31:27.793 --> 31:29.689
brings in a replacement
cylinder

31:29.689 --> 31:31.448
from the laydown yard.

31:32.344 --> 31:33.655
[Jordan] There it is.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.482
[Mitch] This is off of an 11R
so a different model,

31:37.482 --> 31:41.965
but as long as it will work
on this, we'll be happy.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.172
Some repair required.

31:45.172 --> 31:46.344
[Jordan] Yeah.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.068
[dramatic music playing]

31:53.896 --> 31:55.551
[Mitch] Beautiful.

31:55.551 --> 31:57.137
-This is looking good.
-[Jordan] Nice.

31:57.137 --> 31:59.586
I'm just hooking up
the hydraulic lines.

31:59.586 --> 32:02.137
Ripped one apart, so we
gotta put a new one on.

32:07.655 --> 32:09.344
[Mitch] You know, we're taking
this part off of a dozer

32:09.344 --> 32:11.965
that's been sitting parked
for who knows how long,

32:11.965 --> 32:14.103
so no guarantees
this is gonna work,

32:14.103 --> 32:16.862
but we're gonna cross our
fingers here and hope it does.

32:22.137 --> 32:24.241
[dramatic music playing]

32:28.551 --> 32:29.689
[machine whirring]

32:29.689 --> 32:30.689
All right.

32:30.689 --> 32:31.827
[Jordan] Beautiful.

32:33.275 --> 32:34.379
Yeah, it's working.

32:34.379 --> 32:36.689
[bulldozer rattling]

32:36.689 --> 32:39.689
[Mitch] Well, the D11
is back in action.

32:39.689 --> 32:41.586
Just really fortunate we
had a part to put on it.

32:41.586 --> 32:42.896
So, it could've been
a lot worse,

32:42.896 --> 32:45.586
but it's fixed
and ready to go.

32:45.586 --> 32:47.379
Last guy back
is buyin' the beer.

32:47.379 --> 32:49.586
Okay.
Well, I guess I'm broke then.

32:49.586 --> 32:51.241
[laughs]

32:52.379 --> 32:54.793
[narrator] After five hours
of downtime,

32:54.793 --> 32:57.758
the D11 is ready
to get back to work.

32:58.862 --> 33:01.172
[Mitch on radio]
Stephan, you gotta copy?
Stephan?

33:01.172 --> 33:03.103
[Stephan speaking]

33:04.137 --> 33:07.586
Hey, buddy, this D11T is all
back in action for you,

33:07.586 --> 33:10.413
so you're back to moving mud.

33:11.275 --> 33:15.793
[Stephan speaking]

33:15.793 --> 33:17.448
[Mitch on radio]
No problem, man.

33:17.448 --> 33:19.172
You know, three days
to make all this happen.

33:19.172 --> 33:21.000
You know,
we lost a little time here,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.241
but hopefully, we don't have
any more trouble.

33:30.551 --> 33:32.655
[dramatic music playing]

33:50.586 --> 33:52.482
[narrator] After finally
hitting pay dirt

33:52.482 --> 33:54.000
in the super pit

33:54.000 --> 33:55.586
on Paradise Hill,

33:55.586 --> 33:57.655
the Beets family
must now decide

33:57.655 --> 33:59.793
whether to stay at Paradise

33:59.793 --> 34:02.310
or gamble on Indian River.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.103
Yeah, the mud here
is ridiculous.

34:31.896 --> 34:33.241
-Yeah.
-[Mike] Yeah.

34:33.241 --> 34:34.896
It's literally almost
like starting from zero.

34:34.896 --> 34:37.000
I mean, it's gonna be
a lot more work whereas

34:37.000 --> 34:39.931
staying out in the hill,
if we have everything here...

34:41.896 --> 34:46.241
A move always takes way
more than what you think

34:46.241 --> 34:49.103
and it always takes
more time as well.

34:49.103 --> 34:51.068
[Mike] Literally, you always
find out there's more work

34:51.068 --> 34:52.551
than you thought
there would be.

35:15.137 --> 35:18.172
It'll be the shaker deck
in the Indian when we do
start sluicing?

35:19.137 --> 35:21.241
You're gonna put all
your focus on putting that

35:21.241 --> 35:22.482
together?

35:22.482 --> 35:23.965
You don't wanna try

35:23.965 --> 35:26.206
to get the trommel
in place here first?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.241
Okay.

35:49.896 --> 35:52.000
But if we've made
this decision,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.551
we can't be mad about
this decision later.

35:57.172 --> 35:58.482
[Mike clears throat]

35:58.482 --> 35:59.655
[laughter]

35:59.655 --> 36:01.000
[Mike] Wait.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.689
[Monica] Are your pants
burning?

36:02.689 --> 36:04.000
[laughter]

36:05.241 --> 36:06.965
So I guess, decision made?

36:06.965 --> 36:07.965
[Tony speaking]

36:16.482 --> 36:17.344
Yes.

36:17.344 --> 36:18.586
[Tony speaking]

36:18.586 --> 36:19.655
[Monica] Sounds good.

36:20.172 --> 36:21.758
[Minnie] Sounds like a plan.

36:22.793 --> 36:25.379
[narrator] Now Tony
has committed to relocating

36:25.379 --> 36:28.482
his operation
from Paradise Hill,

36:28.482 --> 36:31.379
his 6,000 ounce
season goal hangs

36:31.379 --> 36:35.103
on the success
of the Indian River.

36:35.103 --> 36:37.241
[dramatic music playing]

36:45.689 --> 36:47.793
[Tyson] Parker got some
ground from Dean

36:47.793 --> 36:49.724
and it came with a lot
of equipment.

36:50.896 --> 36:52.448
[narrator] At Dominion Creek,

36:52.448 --> 36:54.896
Parker's crew
are treasure hunting

36:54.896 --> 36:56.655
in their new yard.

36:56.655 --> 36:58.241
[engine rumbling]

36:58.241 --> 37:01.482
The equipment
is in very rough shape.

37:01.482 --> 37:02.758
I don't like this junk.

37:02.758 --> 37:04.344
[acoustic music playing]

37:05.689 --> 37:06.896
[Parker laughs] Oh, yeah.

37:06.896 --> 37:08.862
Look at this old
ancient thing.

37:08.862 --> 37:10.965
[engine turning over]

37:13.068 --> 37:15.620
The tires of this are worth
more than the machine.

37:16.689 --> 37:18.275
Then we got a short bus!

37:18.275 --> 37:20.448
[engine revving]

37:24.689 --> 37:28.034
[Parker] Oh, yes. She's still
got air in all the tires.

37:28.034 --> 37:30.275
-Thank you.
-[Ryan] You're welcome.

37:30.275 --> 37:32.689
I think out of everything,
that is the most useful

37:32.689 --> 37:35.172
vehicle that he bought here,
including all the equipment.

37:35.172 --> 37:36.103
Yup.

37:36.103 --> 37:37.931
[Parker] This is [bleep] sick.

37:46.724 --> 37:48.827
[dramatic music playing]

37:49.137 --> 37:51.241
[fire crackling]

37:52.655 --> 37:53.896
So what's your thought so far?

37:53.896 --> 37:55.896
Yeah. I mean, it feels good.

37:55.896 --> 37:58.344
It feels good to be in
the equipment, to be out here.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.137
I like working with Rick.

38:00.137 --> 38:01.448
[Zee] I thought
I was coming up here to...

38:01.448 --> 38:03.275
Just to help him get
the plant up and running,

38:03.275 --> 38:06.413
but I kind of switched gears
and now I'm hoping

38:06.413 --> 38:08.862
to just get him mentally
prepared for the season.

38:10.896 --> 38:12.793
-Hey.
-[Zee] Hey.

38:12.793 --> 38:14.896
[Rick] Oh, you got fire going
and everything.

38:14.896 --> 38:17.275
[groans] Oh, buddy, I'm tired.

38:17.275 --> 38:18.482
[Zee] Is she all cleaned up?

38:18.482 --> 38:20.172
Oh, yeah, she... Well,

38:20.172 --> 38:22.413
listen, the gold room
is barely set up and I am

38:22.413 --> 38:25.137
not qualified to be running
that [bleep], let me
tell you that.

38:26.103 --> 38:28.241
-So I've seen cleaner gold.
-[Zee] All right.

38:28.241 --> 38:30.000
[Rick] But I don't know.
I mean, it's...

38:30.000 --> 38:32.172
I mean, for what we're up
against, holy [bleep].

38:32.172 --> 38:33.689
I'm pretty happy about it.

38:33.689 --> 38:35.172
We got long ways to go.

38:35.172 --> 38:36.793
You know,
we've got gear coming in,

38:36.793 --> 38:38.344
we've got more crew coming in,

38:38.344 --> 38:39.862
you know, then we're off
to the races.

38:39.862 --> 38:42.482
That's when...
That's when we crank it up
to 11, get after it.

38:43.482 --> 38:45.241
Without further ado,
would you like to see

38:45.241 --> 38:46.758
the dirtiest gold
you've ever sees in your life?

38:46.758 --> 38:48.068
[Zee] I'd like to see
what it weighs.

38:48.068 --> 38:49.068
[Rick] Yeah, me too.

38:49.068 --> 38:51.241
[dramatic music playing]

38:51.241 --> 38:52.862
[Zee] Oh, that ain't too bad.

38:52.862 --> 38:54.689
[Rick laughs]
Yeah, that's pretty dirty.

38:54.689 --> 38:56.793
But here we go, two,

38:56.793 --> 39:01.862
five, eight, 10, 15...

39:01.862 --> 39:03.241
Holy [bleep]
it's going over 20.

39:03.965 --> 39:06.896
-20, 21.2 ounces.
-[Zee] Nice.

39:06.896 --> 39:08.862
[Rick] Holy [bleep].

39:08.862 --> 39:11.137
[Morgan] It's a good start.

39:11.137 --> 39:13.551
[narrator] Rick's first gold
of the season

39:13.551 --> 39:15.620
has exceeded his target,

39:15.620 --> 39:20.275
delivering a $42,000
cash injection.

39:20.275 --> 39:22.034
What do you think, Morgan?

39:22.034 --> 39:23.379
I'm excited.

39:23.379 --> 39:25.103
[Rick] Is that the dirtiest
gold you've ever seen
in your life?

39:25.103 --> 39:26.482
You know what though?
It's still gold.

39:26.482 --> 39:27.620
[Rick] Yes, it is.

39:27.620 --> 39:29.206
[Zee] It's not like
it's not worth anything.

39:29.206 --> 39:30.655
Uh-huh.
See, I like your answer.

39:30.655 --> 39:32.034
We've got a long way to go

39:32.034 --> 39:33.103
but onwards
and upwards from here.

39:33.103 --> 39:35.413
A lot more
gold coming this season.

39:35.413 --> 39:37.310
All right, what do you say,
should we get some dinner?

39:37.310 --> 39:40.655
-[Morgan] Oh, yeah.
-All right. Okay.

39:40.655 --> 39:43.068
[Morgan] Well, it was awesome
getting to be part
of my first gold weigh.

39:43.068 --> 39:45.172
I absolutely love seeing
all the gold in there.

39:45.172 --> 39:46.586
You know, I quit my job

39:46.586 --> 39:48.379
to come out here
and moved from Alaska,

39:48.379 --> 39:50.896
and so this is really
big for me, and getting to see

39:50.896 --> 39:52.862
the gold there just
makes it feel real

39:52.862 --> 39:55.344
and it makes it feel like
I made the right choice,

39:55.344 --> 39:56.793
so I'm really excited to see

39:56.793 --> 39:58.379
what the season
has to bring me.

39:58.379 --> 40:00.379
[fire crackling]

40:00.379 --> 40:02.000
[Rick] I am gonna take
the time to appreciate
this one

40:02.000 --> 40:04.103
single first gold weigh,
you know.

40:04.103 --> 40:05.310
Is it my biggest
gold weigh ever?

40:05.310 --> 40:06.689
Hell, no. Not by a mile.

40:06.689 --> 40:08.241
But it might be
my most important.

40:08.241 --> 40:10.586
You know, I'm still
trying to stop and just,

40:10.586 --> 40:13.896
you know, appreciate it,
'cause, like I said,
you know...

40:13.896 --> 40:15.241
It does mean more this year

40:15.241 --> 40:16.896
and it's the beginning
of my new chapter.

40:16.896 --> 40:18.965
I'm [bleep] excited about it.

40:18.965 --> 40:21.068
[dramatic music playing]

40:30.034 --> 40:32.137
[dramatic music playing]

40:45.551 --> 40:47.310
Man, I don't know how
you're looking over there,

40:47.310 --> 40:48.896
but it's looking
pretty sweet over here.

40:48.896 --> 40:50.793
I think we, uh...

40:50.793 --> 40:52.241
I think we got her.

40:52.241 --> 40:55.724
[narrator] After stripping
non-stop for six days...

40:55.724 --> 40:58.379
[Mitch] Yeah, man.
I'm starting to see a lot
of gravel pokin' through.

40:58.379 --> 40:59.896
I think Parker will be
pretty happy

40:59.896 --> 41:01.758
'cause we got this done
in a week.

41:01.758 --> 41:04.379
[narrator] Parker Schnabel's
crew is finally

41:04.379 --> 41:06.137
down to the gold pay layer.

41:08.034 --> 41:11.413
Here we go!
We got down to some
gravels here in Dominion.

41:11.413 --> 41:13.275
And this is real awesome here.

41:13.275 --> 41:15.103
This is what it's all about.

41:15.103 --> 41:16.586
We're gonna get
this ground thawed out,

41:16.586 --> 41:18.206
we're gonna get
a wash plant set up,

41:18.206 --> 41:20.241
and hopefully there's
a whole bunch of gold

41:20.241 --> 41:21.896
right underneath this gravel.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.000
[dramatic music playing]

41:24.689 --> 41:26.000
[narrator] For 10 years,

41:26.000 --> 41:29.448
while building his mining
empire in the Yukon,

41:29.448 --> 41:31.965
Parker's lived out
of a trailer,

41:31.965 --> 41:34.310
but with the purchase
of Dominion,

41:34.310 --> 41:37.620
he now owns his first house.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.103
I have a house now.

41:39.103 --> 41:41.344
We're having
a housewarming party.

41:42.137 --> 41:43.689
All aboard.

41:43.689 --> 41:45.413
[country music playing]

41:49.620 --> 41:53.172
So, um, the back of the bus
is gonna be the roughest ride.

41:53.172 --> 41:56.137
-[laughter]
-So if you're in the back,
you're gonna wanna hold on.

41:56.137 --> 41:57.310
-[man] Oh, great.
-[bleep].

41:57.310 --> 41:59.379
[bus engine revving]

41:59.379 --> 42:00.482
[man] Whoa!

42:01.137 --> 42:03.758
[crew cheering]

42:03.758 --> 42:05.965
[laughter]

42:15.206 --> 42:18.551
Did it break?
Like, you've got a wine glass?

42:19.655 --> 42:21.379
[man 1] Think about
the children.

42:21.379 --> 42:23.379
-[man 2] Oh, yeah,
you got her there?
-[man 3] Yeah!

42:23.724 --> 42:26.758
[crew cheering]

42:28.517 --> 42:30.862
[all exclaiming]

42:31.551 --> 42:34.034
[all groaning]

42:36.551 --> 42:40.551
-[Parker laughs]
-[engine revving]

42:40.551 --> 42:42.172
[chain clanking]

42:43.241 --> 42:44.758
Everyone watch out.

42:49.965 --> 42:52.068
[crew cheering]

42:55.862 --> 42:57.482
Sorry about your bus, Bill.

42:57.482 --> 42:59.275
[laughs] That's your
bus now, brother.

42:59.275 --> 43:00.793
-[laughs]
-Unfortunately.

43:00.793 --> 43:02.931
[engine rumbling]

43:04.068 --> 43:07.034
Thanks for coming.
Let's get drunk and eat food.

43:07.758 --> 43:09.551
[country music playing]

43:12.137 --> 43:14.034
[Parker] Honestly,
like, can you imagine, like,

43:14.034 --> 43:16.655
"Ten dead in bus accident
on a mine site"?

43:16.655 --> 43:18.275
-[laughter]
-[woman] I can't imagine it.

43:18.275 --> 43:19.827
That is not a headline
we need.

43:21.793 --> 43:23.758
I've never owned
a house before.

43:23.758 --> 43:26.448
It's very weird being
in a house out here.

43:26.448 --> 43:28.000
Well, kinda cool.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.172
Like, my stack can even fit,
like, 20 in here.

43:33.172 --> 43:34.724
But it's a [bleep]
weird house.

43:34.724 --> 43:36.034
Like, come here.

43:36.034 --> 43:38.068
[laughter]

43:38.068 --> 43:40.586
I wouldn't say
I'm a germaphobe,

43:40.586 --> 43:42.689
but this is a bedroom.

43:44.172 --> 43:46.344
And this is
the master bathroom

43:46.344 --> 43:49.034
and, like, that creeps me out.

43:49.034 --> 43:50.862
I don't... I don't like that.

43:52.758 --> 43:54.862
There's carpet
around the toilet.

43:54.862 --> 43:56.206
It's [bleep] gross.

43:56.206 --> 43:57.344
I don't like that.

43:58.172 --> 43:59.862
I don't like that.
I haven't used it yet.

44:00.413 --> 44:01.551
I'm not sure I can.

44:02.344 --> 44:03.448
[indistinct chatter]

44:05.241 --> 44:06.793
Well, congrats on
your first house, man.

44:06.793 --> 44:08.068
-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Parker] Thanks.

44:08.068 --> 44:09.379
Yeah, it's, um...

44:09.379 --> 44:11.068
-[Chris] Nice house.
-It's something.

44:11.068 --> 44:13.689
Well, Parker, I know
this is your starter home.

44:13.689 --> 44:16.206
We finally have a home,
that's really cool,

44:16.206 --> 44:19.620
so I brought this
for later, the celebration.

44:19.620 --> 44:20.793
[Parker] Oh, thank you.

44:20.793 --> 44:22.758
-[Chris] Yeah.
-I really appreciate that.

44:22.758 --> 44:24.586
I think we'll enjoy it.

44:24.586 --> 44:26.965
[laughter]

44:27.793 --> 44:29.310
[Chris]
Congratulations, Parker.

44:29.310 --> 44:30.689
[man] Nice place, man.

44:30.689 --> 44:32.034
Well done, young man.

44:32.034 --> 44:33.620
[laughs] Thank you, Chris.

44:33.620 --> 44:35.586
Congratulations
on being a land owner.

44:35.586 --> 44:37.896
[laughs] Thanks, dude.
I appreciate that.

44:37.896 --> 44:40.034
Yeah, we're here now.

44:40.034 --> 44:42.103
[dramatic music playing]
