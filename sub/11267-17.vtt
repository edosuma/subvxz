"Babes in Toyland"
Closed Captioned

00:01.877 --> 00:03.002
Previously on 90210...

00:03.128 --> 00:06.089
I've decided to go
to Princeton University.

00:06.214 --> 00:06.799
ADRIANNA: He wants you

00:06.924 --> 00:07.633
to ask him to stay.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.677
I'm not gonna hold
him back from this.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.052
Put your own stuff
up at a gallery.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.346
Don't ruin mine.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.305
DIEGO:
I'm not in this for the money.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.849
I'm trying to make people think.

00:14.974 --> 00:16.140
You, on the other hand,

00:16.265 --> 00:17.810
you're just selling
pretty pictures.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.687
You're right, it's much better.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.104
Got any other advice for me?

00:21.229 --> 00:22.147
ANNIE: Here at
the Hillingsbrook
Foundation,

00:22.272 --> 00:25.860
we think it's very
important to try and
take care of our planet.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.319
But your spending more
money on this event

00:27.444 --> 00:28.320
than most people
make in a year.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.113
I thought this was a chance

00:30.238 --> 00:31.740
to do something positive
with my life.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.742
And you know who's
the worst offender?

00:33.868 --> 00:34.702
That Hillingsbrook guy.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.244
I mean, what kind of person
doesn't show up

00:36.370 --> 00:37.287
to their own charity event?

00:37.412 --> 00:38.831
I heard that guy is a real tool.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.582
(scoffs)

00:40.708 --> 00:41.625
You know, maybe
Sheila was right.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.794
Maybe I'm just not
movie star material.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.087
Help!

00:46.213 --> 00:49.633
REPORTER: How do you feel about
people calling you a hero?

00:49.758 --> 00:50.801
I just did what
I had to do.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.386
I just talked to a couple
of casting directors,

00:52.511 --> 00:53.178
and they said you looked
pretty great up there.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.055
VANESSA: Nice job.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.181
Hope the water
wasn't too cold.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.892
ANNIE: Mr. Hillingsbrook?

00:58.017 --> 01:00.227
I am the person who
you left hanging out

01:00.352 --> 01:02.521
to dry yesterday.
I'm not the person
you're looking for.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.690
I think the last time

01:04.815 --> 01:06.274
we talked, you told me

01:06.400 --> 01:08.819
what a tool I was?

01:08.944 --> 01:09.987
Jen?
Hello, darling.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.573
Jacques and I thought you
could use a houseguest or two.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.535
♪ ♪

01:20.205 --> 01:22.249
I just figured Deb and Ryan
on holiday in Spain,

01:22.374 --> 01:24.083
it was the perfect
time to visit.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.628
And it's so wonderful
to be back. (laughs)

01:26.754 --> 01:29.172
I mean, how adorable
are all these tourists?

01:29.297 --> 01:30.925
(chuckles):
Adorable?

01:31.050 --> 01:32.509
Are you forgetting
the time

01:32.634 --> 01:34.595
when you tried to
make fanny packs
in Beverly Hills

01:34.720 --> 01:35.930
a "felony offense"?

01:36.055 --> 01:37.138
Naomi, I've changed.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.516
I've come to appreciate

01:39.641 --> 01:41.685
how thin they
make me feel.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.687
Everyone in Paris
is much too willowy.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.105
(laughs)
Especially the men.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.650
Between that and the
insufficient hygiene,

01:48.776 --> 01:51.862
dating prospects in Paris,
they're not so bon.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.196
Well,

01:53.321 --> 01:54.281
maybe you can...

01:54.406 --> 01:55.490
find someone
while you're here.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.577
Ooh, you and I
can think alike.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.496
While I'm here, I plan
to meet and marry

02:01.622 --> 02:03.582
a handsome American
billionaire.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.166
You don't mind
babysitting, do you?

02:05.292 --> 02:06.460
Just while I
go on dates.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.377
Um, typically I
wouldn't mind,

02:08.502 --> 02:10.505
but I've been really
busy as of late.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.299
(chuckles)
Doing what?

02:12.424 --> 02:13.008
And don't say coursework.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.803
You go to C.U.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.429
Actually, I started
my own business.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.140
(laughs) Naomi
Clark Events.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.183
And not to brag
or anything, but...

02:22.309 --> 02:24.394
I just pulled off a very
challenging birthday party

02:24.519 --> 02:26.688
for Mitchell
Nash's daughter.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.607
That's wonderful, Naomi.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.525
You know,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.152
partying has always been
your one strong suit.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.528
So, I think it's great

02:33.654 --> 02:35.990
you're trying to
turn it into a job.

02:36.115 --> 02:38.325
Well,
actually...
Hold my latte!
I want to see if they have

02:38.450 --> 02:40.201
those boots in my size.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.793
So, tomorrow at 10:00,

02:47.918 --> 02:49.377
you're auditioning to play

02:49.503 --> 02:50.712
"Hot Partygoer #4."

02:50.838 --> 02:54.008
And then at 2:00, you've
got an audition for--

02:54.133 --> 02:55.509
oh, this one's for
an indie movie.

02:55.634 --> 02:59.138
Uh, the part is
"Shirtless Roofer."

02:59.262 --> 03:02.307
What, they couldn't even
dignify the guy with a name?
(chuckles)

03:02.432 --> 03:03.976
Come on, he does hard labor.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.061
Hey, babe.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.438
So, guess who
just called me.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.648
Who?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.900
Lee Brodsky's assistant.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.444
Lee Brodsky,
as in the movie producer?

03:14.569 --> 03:15.737
Yeah. Apparently
he's heard our track,

03:15.863 --> 03:17.656
and he wants to
meet tomorrow

03:17.781 --> 03:19.992
about some songs for
the new action film.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.828
That is amazing.
Right? (laughs)

03:22.953 --> 03:24.496
Uh, wait, I just told Liam

03:24.621 --> 03:26.081
that I would cover
for him tomorrow.

03:26.205 --> 03:29.376
Is there any way we
could maybe push it?
Uh, pr-probably not.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.003
He's super busy.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.629
I mean, they're recasting a
role, or something like that.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.923
I kind of feel like
it's tomorrow or never.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.509
Okay. Well, maybe you can do
the meeting without me, then.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.302
Babe, babe, no. No,
no, I can't do...

03:39.427 --> 03:42.097
Look, we're a team, okay?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.598
Yeah.
We got to do
this together.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.726
He's not gonna want
to just meet one of us.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.394
Okay.
Look, I know you
were really nervous

03:47.519 --> 03:49.312
about getting back
into the music thing,

03:49.437 --> 03:52.524
but... you got to
let me know, okay,

03:52.649 --> 03:54.234
if you're in this
a hundred percent.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.361
No, of course I am in it.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.071
I'm totally in it.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.613
Okay.
(laughs)

03:58.739 --> 04:00.032
I'll go talk to Liam.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.909
I'm sure we can
figure something out.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.077
Ah, that's my girl.

04:03.202 --> 04:04.244
Come here.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.830
Mmm. I'm gonna start
getting ready, okay?

04:06.955 --> 04:07.831
Mm-hmm.
I love you.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.209
(giggles) I love you, too.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.214
Hey, uh,

04:15.338 --> 04:16.714
so about my shift tomorrow...
Yeah,

04:16.839 --> 04:18.591
thanks for covering--
you're a lifesaver.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.678
Uh, okay, something
kind of just came up.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.764
Dixon and I have
some pretty big stuff

04:23.889 --> 04:27.601
happening with our music,
and it's really important, so...

04:27.726 --> 04:29.394
Well, that's great, but
I've got all these auditions,

04:29.519 --> 04:31.146
and I really need
someone to be here.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.439
That's kind of why I hired you.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.274
(laughs)
Yeah, well, you hired me

04:34.399 --> 04:35.734
because you were
being a good friend.

04:35.859 --> 04:39.404
Right?
Well, now I have
to be the boss. Sorry.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.909
Okay. Well...
well, then I'm sorry, too.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.745
(sighs)

04:47.788 --> 04:49.539
Wait, you're quitting?

04:49.664 --> 04:53.085
I just, I don't see another way.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.296
(sighs)

04:59.883 --> 05:01.301
Thanks.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.096
Mr. Hillingsbrook?

05:04.221 --> 05:06.223
PRESTON: Incoming!

05:07.266 --> 05:08.391
ANNIE:
Oh...!

05:08.516 --> 05:09.226
What are you doing?

05:09.350 --> 05:11.686
Wine balloon archery.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.106
I break the balloon,

05:14.231 --> 05:15.983
it fills the glass,
and I drink it.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.276
Would you like to try it?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.693
It's an excellent
Chateau Latour.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.528
No. No, I want to talk.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.363
I really need you
to reconsider.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.992
You're being the world's
biggest do-gooder?

05:25.117 --> 05:27.661
Don't you want to call
me a phony jerk first?

05:27.786 --> 05:29.579
I'm sorry that
I called you names.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.291
But I'm not really buying
the "eccentric rich kid" act.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.959
If you really hate
those charity functions

05:34.084 --> 05:36.711
then why were you there
pretending to be the bartender?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.881
I was just stopping by
for some free champagne.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.716
Oh. Because you're
so strapped for booze at home?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.761
I think you secretly
really care about stuff,

05:44.886 --> 05:46.847
and you want your life
to be about more than just

05:46.972 --> 05:49.390
writing checks and drinking
rubbery tasting wine.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.685
And I bet you know just the
thing to give my life meaning.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.561
Yes. A nonprofit business.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.982
We are going to make and market
designer tote bags.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.067
All proceeds
go to charity,

05:59.193 --> 06:01.278
and the bags themselves
help the environment...

06:01.402 --> 06:02.403
It sounds like work.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.948
Maybe you should
try that sometime.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.742
Really?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.661
Is that how you made your money?

06:09.786 --> 06:13.123
No. I inherited it
a couple of months ago.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.042
There you go.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.127
New money, new guilt.
What are you
talking about?

06:17.252 --> 06:20.379
I'm talking about your
obvious discomfort with wealth.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.882
It's killing my buzz.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.592
I'm just trying to make
what I have mean something,

06:24.718 --> 06:27.012
and honor the person
that gave it to me.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.097
Which is exactly
what I'm doing.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.641
Generations of Hillingsbrooks
have worked very hard

06:31.766 --> 06:33.685
for me to live this way.
But...

06:33.810 --> 06:34.353
Good day, Wilson.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.355
You could show yourself out,

06:36.479 --> 06:37.564
or I'll release the hounds.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.857
Look, if you change your mind

06:38.982 --> 06:41.735
and decide to do something
meaningful with your life,

06:41.860 --> 06:43.070
let me know.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.282
Whoo!

06:47.406 --> 06:49.243
Look! Good boy!

06:49.368 --> 06:51.536
Okay, Silver, I'm supposed
to meet that Diego kid later

06:51.661 --> 06:54.248
at his studio, and
he wanted me to bring
an interesting image.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.916
What do you think
about this one?

06:57.292 --> 06:59.253
All I see is the caption:

06:59.378 --> 07:01.796
"Two-time NYU reject."

07:01.922 --> 07:05.342
(sighs) Two minutes,
and I find out if I got in.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.385
Two minutes.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.427
Since Navid is off at Princeton,

07:08.553 --> 07:10.430
I just, I can't keep sitting
around here, wondering

07:10.555 --> 07:12.682
when my life is going to start.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.017
You hear that, Jacques?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.518
Don't wait.
Seize the day.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.729
You're supposed to
be playing with him,

07:17.854 --> 07:19.439
not trying

07:19.564 --> 07:22.943
to turn him into some sort
of counterculture anarchist.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.240
Sorry.
Okay, I got to go.
You promise to text me

07:28.365 --> 07:28.865
the minute you find out?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.076
Yeah.
Okay. Good luck!

07:31.201 --> 07:33.703
Hey, how was your
shopping trip with Jen?

07:35.247 --> 07:37.124
Well, if I was shopping
for passive-aggressive digs,

07:37.249 --> 07:39.042
it would have been
a wild success.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.128
(sets bags down)
(groans)

07:41.253 --> 07:42.545
All my life my whole family
never thought

07:42.670 --> 07:43.755
I could do anything important.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.257
I mean,
every year for Christmas,

07:45.382 --> 07:47.426
Jen would get books
and brainy stuff,

07:47.550 --> 07:51.054
and I would get...
hair products.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.514
Family dynamics can be intense.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.435
Just try not to care
too much what she thinks.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.186
No, I don't.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.273
I just want to rub her face
in how successful I actually am.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.858
Which is why, when
she was out shoe shopping,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.027
I cold-called
Paddington Publishing House.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.528
You know they
throw that annual

08:07.654 --> 08:09.489
book announcement party
every year.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.657
Didn't they once
have Stephen King

08:10.782 --> 08:11.491
jump out of a red velvet cake?

08:11.616 --> 08:13.618
That was a low point
for them, yes.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.662
But I spoke to their
public relations VP,

08:15.787 --> 08:18.165
and she wants to meet me,
here, later today.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.833
And my house looks like

08:19.958 --> 08:22.294
a well-appointed
Chuck E. Cheese.
Yep. That's my bad.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.463
I'll help you clean
those up in three...

08:24.587 --> 08:25.880
two...

08:26.006 --> 08:26.631
one.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.803
I got in.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.761
You got in?
I got in!

08:32.886 --> 08:34.306
To NYU?!

08:34.431 --> 08:37.100
(squealing, laughter)

08:37.225 --> 08:38.309
Ahh!

08:38.434 --> 08:41.020
Are we still gonna
pick up the toys?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.481
(exhales)

08:45.066 --> 08:47.902
Okay, so I wasn't able
to get you a meeting

08:48.028 --> 08:49.404
with Lee Brodsky.
I honestly

08:49.529 --> 08:52.115
have no idea how Adrianna
and Dixon managed that one.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.659
But... I was
able to get you

08:54.784 --> 08:57.245
the next best thing:
an audition.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.288
Another audition?

08:58.413 --> 09:00.581
Liam, this character
actually has a name.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.416
Private Wilkerson.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.418
Now, it's a small,
supporting role

09:03.543 --> 09:06.546
but it has got
breakout potential.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.674
So, before you
get too excited,
it is an open call.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.801
There'll probably be
hundreds of guys trying out

09:11.926 --> 09:15.763
for the part, but, Liam,
I just know you can get this!

09:15.889 --> 09:17.224
So this is for
the part of the soldier?

09:17.349 --> 09:20.810
A monologue by... "Goath"?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.271
Goethe. It's, like,
subtext or something.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.732
Whatever.
Anyways, go ahead,

09:25.857 --> 09:27.859
give it a shot!

09:28.860 --> 09:30.362
(clears throat)

09:30.487 --> 09:31.988
"To this has it come!

09:32.113 --> 09:33.240
"To this!

09:33.365 --> 09:35.367
"Treacherous,
contemptible spirit,

09:35.492 --> 09:37.785
"and thou hast
concealed it from me!

09:37.911 --> 09:39.704
"Stand, then...

09:39.829 --> 09:41.748
"then stand.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.251
"Roll thy devilish eyes
wrathfully in the...

09:44.376 --> 09:46.002
in-in thy head!"

09:47.003 --> 09:50.424
Yeah! Y-You just have
to go over it a couple of times.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.841
You're gonna be great!

09:51.966 --> 09:53.760
Sweet.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.816
Yes, hello.
This is Adrianna Tate-Duncan

10:08.942 --> 10:12.446
calling to confirm
my meeting with Mr. Brodsky.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.284
The Carrington, at 4:30.

10:17.409 --> 10:20.579
Yes, that's right. Thank you.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.497
Oh, I'll be there.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.251
( 90210 theme playing )

10:40.014 --> 10:41.099
WOMAN: I am loving your ideas,

10:41.224 --> 10:43.268
but tell me,
do you have much experience

10:43.393 --> 10:45.645
dealing with celebrities?
Oh, yes; as a
matter of fact,

10:45.770 --> 10:47.939
I just did an...
Naomi, I had to borrow
some of your

10:48.064 --> 10:49.190
Crème de la Mer.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.858
(laughter)

10:50.984 --> 10:52.360
Amanda Dean,

10:52.486 --> 10:54.488
is that you?

10:54.613 --> 10:55.905
Jen, what are you doing here?

10:56.030 --> 10:58.450
She's my sister; I didn't
know you two knew each other.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.076
We went to high
school together.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.953
Yeah, we were
always duking it out

11:02.078 --> 11:04.205
to be the smartest
one in the class.
Mm-hm,

11:04.331 --> 11:05.832
and now look at us.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.250
I'm a jet-setting
publishing executive,

11:07.375 --> 11:10.462
and you... have a baby.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.047
And you're living
in your little sister's house.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.799
Oh, no, no-no-no.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.801
I live in Paris.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.094
My life is
much more glamorous than this,

11:18.219 --> 11:19.929
I can assure you.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.222
And as I was saying,

11:21.348 --> 11:23.099
I actually just did an
event for Mitchell Nash.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.184
Well, it was... actually,
Hm.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.143
it was a birthday party

11:25.268 --> 11:26.227
for his daughter.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.312
Isn't that adorable?

11:27.437 --> 11:29.648
It was still an event.
Oh, yes,

11:29.814 --> 11:30.731
of course it was.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.984
I'm sure the children
had a wonderful time.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.154
You do have the infrastructure
to handle a really big event?

11:36.279 --> 11:38.365
I can't be sending
my boss any amateurs.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.782
I can handle anything.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.535
(phone ringing)
Ah, speak of the devil.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.828
This is my boss.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.457
He really wants
to lock things down.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.043
Can I tell him you'll give him
a full presentation tomorrow?

11:50.168 --> 11:51.794
Perfect.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.963
Okay, what's the address
of your office?

11:54.088 --> 11:57.425
The address of my office is...

11:57.551 --> 12:00.303
2153...

12:00.428 --> 12:02.930
Harper Boulevard.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.724
Well, if it's anything
like your house,

12:05.850 --> 12:07.352
I'm sure it's to die for.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.437
He'll see you
there at 4:30.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.605
I'm gonna
walk you out.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.815
So, tell me more
about this boss of yours.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.943
Oh...

12:16.069 --> 12:17.195
Go ahead.
Peel it off.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.656
Okay, that is awesome.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.907
Yeah, it's gonna
look even awesomer

12:21.032 --> 12:21.866
when you actually put it up.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.034
Up?

12:23.159 --> 12:24.578
What do you mean?

12:24.703 --> 12:25.786
Like-like on the street?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.038
Yeah, hence the
term "street art."

12:27.163 --> 12:28.623
What's the matter?

12:28.747 --> 12:30.250
I thought that you
were into this.
No,

12:30.375 --> 12:31.543
I am, I just... I don't know.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.835
I don't know
if I want to be part

12:32.960 --> 12:34.795
of the whole criminal
aspects of it.
Okay, wait.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.506
Hang on a second; it's not
like we're going out there,

12:36.631 --> 12:38.174
putting up gang
signs or anything.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.217
I know that.
We're provoking people.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.927
Trying to add some mystery

12:41.052 --> 12:43.597
to their otherwise
boring-ass daily lives.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.473
Would you rather put
this up on a canvas,

12:45.599 --> 12:48.643
so that it ends up on some
rich old d-bag's bathroom wall?

12:48.767 --> 12:50.061
Obviously not, but...

12:50.186 --> 12:53.565
You want to spend the rest of
your life hiding in a gallery

12:53.690 --> 12:55.442
just 'cause you're afraid
to take a little risk?

12:55.567 --> 12:56.859
Okay, first of all,

12:56.984 --> 12:57.776
I've surfed Mavericks,

12:57.902 --> 13:00.447
and I was married to a guy
who was dying of cancer.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.031
I'm not exactly afraid
of taking risks.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.450
All right, I'm just...

13:03.575 --> 13:05.702
sick of them, actually.
No.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.412
I think you're scared.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.456
I just don't know if
it's getting caught,

13:09.581 --> 13:11.332
or getting close to me.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.628
I got to go.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.633
All right, but, uh,
if you change your mind,

13:19.758 --> 13:22.343
me and my crew are going out
tomorrow night.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.178
You should come by.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.352
DIXON: Okay, so, tell me
what you think.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.145
Okay.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.481
(mid-tempo jazz playing)

13:38.025 --> 13:39.902
Pretty epic, right?

13:40.027 --> 13:42.614
Yeah, in a Dixieland band
sort of way.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.865
(chuckles)
I think we just need to
add like a little bit

13:44.991 --> 13:45.992
more beat or something.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.868
A little beat...

13:47.994 --> 13:48.995
(phone ringing)
Oh, wait.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.163
Hold on.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.498
(ringing continues)

13:51.623 --> 13:53.750
Hello?

13:53.874 --> 13:55.418
Wait.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.546
The VP of A&amp;R for Def Jam
Records wants to meet with us.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.466
Tomorrow at 3:00?

14:01.591 --> 14:03.092
We got the other meeting.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.012
Um... yeah, is there any way

14:06.137 --> 14:08.264
we could do it another day,
another time?

14:08.389 --> 14:10.809
No, no, no,
I totally understand, yeah.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.018
We'll be there.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.394
Yeah, both of us.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.564
3:00 Echo Park Grill?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.817
Do you mind if I get
your number, actually?

14:18.941 --> 14:19.900
Perfect.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.027
Okay, cool.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.237
Thank you so much.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.239
Okay, bye.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.032
Can you believe this?

14:26.157 --> 14:27.450
Two huge meetings?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.076
Ah!

14:29.202 --> 14:30.411
Wow, um...

14:30.537 --> 14:32.038
Oh...

14:32.163 --> 14:33.748
This is... this is awesome.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.125
But... the other meeting's all
the way across town at 4:30.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.211
Do you really think
we're gonna make it?

14:38.336 --> 14:41.005
Well, the Def Jam guy's
only in town for one day.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.298
Yeah, I get that, but...

14:42.423 --> 14:44.592
Okay, you asked me
if I was in this 100%, and I am.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.469
Okay, we cannot waste
any opportunities.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.470
It's fine.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.180
We'll just...
we'll talk really fast,

14:49.305 --> 14:50.056
and we won't take the freeway.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.932
Okay, all right.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.560
Okay, okay.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.061
Oh, I'm so excited.

14:55.186 --> 14:58.231
So, you just made up
a totally random address, huh?

14:58.356 --> 14:59.440
I was on the spot,

14:59.566 --> 15:01.359
and it wasn't
completely random.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.319
My hair salon used
to be on this block.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.072
Nobody is gonna hire
a events planner

15:06.197 --> 15:08.282
who works
out of a hair salon, Naomi.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.034
Okay, so I'll figure it out.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.246
I'll offer to rent the place for
some obscene amount of money.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.539
I'm sure they'll go for it.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.583
And then slap my
name on the wall,

15:16.708 --> 15:18.543
and bribe whoever
works there to pretend

15:18.668 --> 15:20.127
to be my staff
for a few hours.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.962
But it's practically
too easy.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.757
Oh, my God!

15:23.882 --> 15:25.049
There it is.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.926
(laughs)

15:27.051 --> 15:29.011
And look, it's just
a quaint little...

15:31.097 --> 15:33.057
...sex shop.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.642
Uh, you know,

15:34.768 --> 15:35.685
I'm just gonna go.

15:35.810 --> 15:36.811
Stay here and help me.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.731
And try not to think of
what people do with those.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.023
Ugh.
Hi.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.108
Excuse me.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.736
It's a fabulous
store you have here.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.946
What would it cost to
rent it out for the day?

15:47.071 --> 15:48.907
I don't know,
I'd have to ask my manager.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.456
Thank you, Mr. Smith.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.499
We appreciate
your business.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.334
Okay, blondie.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.377
Are you high
or just a moron?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.588
You think
you can rent us out

16:03.713 --> 16:05.840
like a karaoke room?
I don't think so.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.426
Well, I'm willing
to make it worth your while.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.552
That's impossible.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.511
Uh, the weekend
before Valentine's Day

16:10.637 --> 16:12.764
is our biggest sales event
of the year.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.265
We call it black
leather Friday.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.182
(giggles)
Clever.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.226
Just cancel the meeting.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.228
And prove Jen right?
Are you insane?

16:19.353 --> 16:20.354
(sighs)

16:20.480 --> 16:21.689
What if I buy everything?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.483
Everything?

16:23.608 --> 16:24.859
Yes,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.861
down to the last...

16:26.986 --> 16:28.780
novelty condom.

16:28.905 --> 16:29.989
Except that.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.282
I won't buy that.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.118
I-I'm allergic to
vinyl; it gives me a
rash.

16:34.243 --> 16:34.911
I will, however,

16:35.035 --> 16:36.245
give you a thousand dollars each

16:36.370 --> 16:37.371
to pretend to
be my employees

16:37.497 --> 16:39.582
provided that you
can find some...

16:39.707 --> 16:41.083
non-crotchless clothing.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.296
I take it role-playing
is on your résumés?

16:47.799 --> 16:49.175
You got yourself a deal.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.134
Excellent.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.303
All right, ladies,

16:52.428 --> 16:54.180
welcome to Naomi Clark Events.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.441
ANNIE: I'm glad
you finally came around.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.609
Well, resistance
seemed futile.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.696
Besides, you seem like
one of those...

17:10.821 --> 17:12.824
plucky, annoying people
who don't give up.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.160
So, I decided
to do your project.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.871
Thanks.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.288
With one condition.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.959
I cannot work with someone

17:23.083 --> 17:24.711
who's going to make guilty
about my money,

17:24.836 --> 17:26.963
so I need you to prove to me

17:27.087 --> 17:28.882
that you're not gonna
be guilty with yours.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.300
And how exactly
am I supposed to do that?

17:31.425 --> 17:32.927
I want you to buy something.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.053
That's all?

17:34.178 --> 17:34.971
Yeah.
Listen,

17:35.095 --> 17:35.972
PJ, I went
to West Beverly High,

17:36.096 --> 17:38.766
I can shop.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.935
Here.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.729
Not a $200 wallet.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.355
Something big,

17:44.480 --> 17:45.398
something you've always wanted,

17:45.523 --> 17:46.733
something that
you secretly wanted

17:46.858 --> 17:47.525
but you could never afford.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.278
Uh...

17:51.404 --> 17:52.196
Mm!

17:52.321 --> 17:54.240
These are kind of nice.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.825
No looking at price tags!

17:55.950 --> 17:57.827
Money is no object.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.537
Come on.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.205
Hm.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.005
That is quite a bag.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.258
It's no canvas tote for charity,
but it'll do.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.093
I'm impressed.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.889
And you know what?

18:18.014 --> 18:19.557
It's on me.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.602
Looks like we're
in business together, Wilson.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.479
Enjoy the bag.

18:35.531 --> 18:35.865
Please let this be him.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.867
Come on.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.703
(sighs)

18:40.828 --> 18:43.247
Um, maybe you should
call his assistant, huh?

18:43.372 --> 18:43.998
Make sure
the guy's on his way?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.584
Okay, yeah.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.753
Okay.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.630
That's weird.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.632
It says the call can't
be completed as dialed.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.509
It's okay. Um, let's just

18:55.635 --> 18:57.470
give it five minutes,
and then we can get out of here.

18:57.595 --> 18:58.721
All right?
Five minutes.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.180
Yeah, five minutes,
we can do this.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.141
Five minutes, okay.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.489
Ugh, don't mind me,

19:16.614 --> 19:19.366
I'm just pretty sure
I got stood up.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.702
And I thought I
was the only one.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.870
Really?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.581
Wow, well,

19:25.706 --> 19:27.416
maybe we're supposed
to meet each other.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.584
You don't happen

19:28.709 --> 19:30.461
to be a musical duo, do you?

19:30.586 --> 19:32.171
Nope.

19:32.296 --> 19:36.175
No, I'm just a single gal.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.305
NAOMI: I'm so proud of us.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.890
You would never know
this was a sex shop.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.558
Whoo!

19:47.103 --> 19:48.270
Okay.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.314
Wow.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.151
Shirazi Studios, very nice.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.153
Okay, that reminds me,

19:55.277 --> 19:56.904
I've got to go to the doctor
to get my vaccinations,

19:57.030 --> 19:59.699
It is the last hurdle until I'm
officially a college student.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.117
Yeah!

20:01.241 --> 20:02.242
All right, is this it?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.162
Oh, wait. No.
There's another one.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.246
I swear to God, they keep
popping out of nowhere.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.957
It's like some pervert

20:08.082 --> 20:10.001
got a magical wish
granted or something.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.585
Okay.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.838
Well, good luck to you.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.923
Oh.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.009
Mr. Paddington.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.887
And Jen.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.763
JEN:
Well, we just happened

20:22.889 --> 20:24.473
to bump into each
other outside.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.475
What a wonderful coincidence.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.935
Yes. Truly.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.311
Your sister's
a real delight.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.355
JEN:
Tell me, does

20:31.480 --> 20:33.983
Mrs. Paddington work in the
publishing business, as well?

20:34.108 --> 20:35.442
Uh... no.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.653
No, there is no Mrs. Paddington.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.072
Oh, thank you.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.280
How interesting.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.490
(clears throat)

20:41.615 --> 20:43.534
So, to get started,
I'd like to say,

20:43.659 --> 20:45.411
I am sick and tired,
as you probably are,

20:45.536 --> 20:46.871
of the monotonous
party parade...

20:46.996 --> 20:49.165
You know, I always say
that a party's really only

20:49.289 --> 20:51.209
as interesting as the
people in attendance.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.670
That is so deeply true.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.296
And since you publish books...

20:56.422 --> 20:58.216
I love books.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.175
WILLIAM (laughing):
Oh.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.094
I'm glad to hear that.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.344
I do. I read a lot.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.054
Oh.
I went to Yale.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.847
So...
Really?

21:04.972 --> 21:09.268
What better way
to evoke the wonder of books

21:09.393 --> 21:10.686
than by returning us to the ones

21:10.811 --> 21:13.814
that thrilled us the most
during our youth?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.983
I give you...
The Enchanted Forest.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.693
Intimate, mysterious.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.361
It's a welcome relief

21:19.486 --> 21:21.280
from the generic Hollywood
glitz. There will be

21:21.405 --> 21:22.406
trees growing out of tables...

21:22.531 --> 21:24.575
Speaking of forests,
do you like hiking?

21:24.700 --> 21:25.492
WILLIAM:
I love it.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.329
But do you know
what I love even more?

21:29.455 --> 21:31.540
An excellent meal

21:31.665 --> 21:33.626
with a charming companion.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.796
Pick you up at 8:00?

21:36.921 --> 21:37.964
Mm.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.174
All right, well,
I've heard enough.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.426
You know, there's more
that I can show you.
No, Naomi.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.304
I think the concept
is fantastic,

21:45.429 --> 21:47.598
and Amanda had
already sold me.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.392
I have no doubt
that you and your staff

21:50.517 --> 21:52.186
will make it a night
to remember.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.479
(laughs)

21:53.604 --> 21:55.022
Jen?
Yes?

21:55.148 --> 21:56.274
Walk me out?

21:56.398 --> 21:58.609
JEN: Sure.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.200
(whispers):
Yes!

22:06.325 --> 22:08.828
Thanks.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.663
Erin Silver, how are you?

22:10.788 --> 22:11.747
Hi.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.707
I can't believe
you're heading off to college.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.127
Last time I filled out
vaccination forms for you,

22:16.252 --> 22:17.711
I think it was
for summer camp.
(scoffs)

22:17.837 --> 22:20.214
Well, don't worry. I'm not
coming back from NYU

22:20.339 --> 22:20.965
with poison oak
and swimmer's ear.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.842
(laughs)
Good.

22:22.967 --> 22:23.843
Guess that means
you're all grown up.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.219
Yeah.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.428
Which means
we should probably talk

22:26.553 --> 22:28.681
about your family
medical history.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.558
Erin, your mom, your aunt
and your grandmother

22:31.684 --> 22:33.393
all died of breast cancer.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.352
And I know the drill.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.814
Self exams, regular checkups.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.899
I'm gonna start doing those.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.358
Good. You also
should consider

22:40.484 --> 22:42.402
getting tested
for the Braca gene.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.864
If you have the Braca one
or two mutation,

22:44.989 --> 22:46.657
your future includes
an up to 60% chance

22:46.782 --> 22:48.201
of getting breast cancer.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.994
You'd have to consider
preventative measures,

22:50.119 --> 22:51.912
such as a prophylactic
mastectomy and...

22:52.038 --> 22:54.040
Do we have to talk about it now?

22:54.165 --> 22:55.415
We do.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.669
I've... I've had
a pretty crappy year,

22:58.794 --> 23:02.173
and I finally have something
to look forward to.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.300
So, right now, I just want
to get my life started.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.593
You're going to college.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.386
I probably won't be
seeing you anymore.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.890
And by your early twenties,
this could be a very

23:11.015 --> 23:12.599
urgent concern.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.435
It's my job to make sure
you're informed about this.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.938
I just want
to be excited about my future.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.983
And I just want you
to have a healthy one.

23:30.076 --> 23:33.662
JEN: Oh, look at your little
party decorations. FYI:

23:33.787 --> 23:35.956
I may be bringing William
back here later.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.666
And if my powers are anything
like they used to be,

23:37.791 --> 23:39.335
he may well have proposed
by morning.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.836
(laughing): Well, you're
not wasting any time.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.421
Well, I just have a really
good feeling about him.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.466
And not just for
me. For Jacques.

23:46.592 --> 23:50.554
Yes, I'm sure he can get Jacques
many free copies of Babar.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.305
It's not about that.

23:51.429 --> 23:54.808
Or really even about the money.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.811
I see Debbie and Ryan
and Jacques together,

23:57.937 --> 24:01.023
and they are like a
perfect little family.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.233
Is it so wrong to think

24:02.358 --> 24:04.735
that maybe I could have
something like that, too?

24:04.860 --> 24:06.653
That I am not
destined to be alone?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.948
No, of course not.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.574
(footsteps approaching)

24:10.699 --> 24:12.159
Hey, guys.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.121
Uh,

24:15.246 --> 24:18.124
is that the new
Tradesrogue crocodile hobo?

24:18.249 --> 24:19.541
I picked it up today.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.252
That's a really
expensive bag.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.003
You know what?

24:23.129 --> 24:24.380
I didn't even look at the price.

24:24.504 --> 24:27.341
But even if it was, like $1,000,

24:27.465 --> 24:28.717
I'm okay with that.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.136
Yeah. Try $40,000.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.678
Mm.
Mm.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.972
$40,000?

24:33.097 --> 24:35.641
Oh, my God.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.644
I let him buy me a $40,000 bag?!

24:38.769 --> 24:41.021
Well, whoever he is,
he sounds like a keeper.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.607
I have to run.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.817
Jacques might
wake up...

24:44.942 --> 24:46.819
No. No, Jen, you can't
leave me with Jacques.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.196
I have too much
to do for this party.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.282
...and if he does, he'll
need a diaper change.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.160
Any interest in baby-sitting?

24:54.285 --> 24:57.955
Sorry. I just realized there's
something I need to go do.
Right.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.748
And I'm just... standing here
with my thumb up my...

24:59.873 --> 25:01.499
(baby crying)

25:01.625 --> 25:03.961
Aah! Don't worry.
Auntie's coming.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.503
I need a baby-sitter.

25:07.381 --> 25:08.174
DIXON:
Okay, yes.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.508
Okay, I get it.
I get it.

25:10.634 --> 25:14.138
Um, but are you sure he can't
squeeze us in, like, right now?

25:14.263 --> 25:16.474
(nervous chuckle)
I mean, we can meet anywhere.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.059
Well, we weren't
exactly snoozing.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.228
We were actually stuck
in traffic...

25:21.354 --> 25:22.729
Hello?

25:23.981 --> 25:26.859
Oh! I can't believe it.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.236
(sighs)
We totally blew it.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.238
No, it's okay.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.531
Um, I know this sucks, but

25:33.657 --> 25:35.617
there will be
other meetings, okay?

25:35.742 --> 25:36.785
We'll just learn
from our mistakes.

25:36.910 --> 25:39.872
We can't make any more mistakes.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.249
I quit my job, Dixon.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.003
Uh... (nervous laugh)

25:46.128 --> 25:48.255
Baby, uh, that's kind of
jumping the gun.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.965
Don't you think?

25:50.090 --> 25:51.384
You do know the phrase,

25:51.509 --> 25:53.135
"Don't quit
your day job," right?

25:53.260 --> 25:55.346
Yeah, well, I thought, according
to you, the phrase was,

25:55.471 --> 25:58.474
"And if you're not in it with me
100%, you're not in it at all."

25:58.598 --> 26:00.558
Um, what are you talking about?

26:00.684 --> 26:02.436
That is what you were saying,
isn't it?

26:02.560 --> 26:04.104
I mean, if we don't make it
as a team,

26:04.230 --> 26:05.356
we don't make it as a couple?

26:05.481 --> 26:07.858
Whoa, Ade. No.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.735
Babe, our relationship

26:09.860 --> 26:11.945
and our business are two
completely different things.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.532
If the business side
doesn't work out,

26:14.656 --> 26:16.075
it's not gonna affect
our relationship.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.286
Do you promise?

26:21.163 --> 26:23.290
Yes, I promise.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.668
And I'm sure Liam would give you
your job back in a heartbeat.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.795
He's a friend.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.639
Hey, your door was unlocked.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.725
Whoa, what happened with this?

26:41.850 --> 26:45.603
Ugh. Well, I asked
Jacques' baby-sitter for help,

26:45.729 --> 26:48.190
but apparently, she's no whiz
with the hot glue gun.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.901
(glue gun squeaking)

26:51.026 --> 26:53.112
So, how is prep
for NYU going?

26:53.237 --> 26:54.363
Have you started
practicing hailing cabs

26:54.488 --> 26:56.656
and being snobbish
about pizza?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.034
You know, I'm not really feeling
the whole NYU thing today.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.244
(scoffs)

27:00.369 --> 27:01.619
What are you talking about?

27:01.745 --> 27:03.038
You've been excited
about this for years.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.082
Yeah, I know. It's just...

27:05.207 --> 27:06.750
(phone ringing)
Wait.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.626
Hold that thought.

27:10.463 --> 27:13.424
Mr. Paddington,
how can I help you?

27:13.549 --> 27:15.675
Your wallet?

27:15.801 --> 27:20.264
That you left in the pocket
of your coat at my office.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.891
I understand.
Of course.

27:23.016 --> 27:27.521
I will send one of my assistants
there right away to look for it.

27:27.645 --> 27:28.606
It's not a problem.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.108
(nervous laugh)

27:31.233 --> 27:33.527
Except it's not your office,
and you have no assistants.

27:35.862 --> 27:38.157
Listen, guys, we're not
gonna have long to put it up.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.950
All right? So, we're all gonna
have to, like, move as fast

27:40.075 --> 27:41.494
as we can,
you know what I'm saying?

27:41.619 --> 27:43.537
(clears throat)
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.210
Just so you know, okay,
I'm not here for you.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.171
I'm just into
doing the art.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.214
Okay. And you thought
you'd look less conspicuous

27:54.340 --> 27:56.842
dressed up as
a, uh, ninja?

27:56.967 --> 28:00.513
I just thought it would help me
blend in with the night, okay?

28:00.638 --> 28:03.056
Yeah, uh, it's just that there's
been this little invention

28:03.182 --> 28:05.100
that's called
street lamps.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.852
Right.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.604
Ooh.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.356
Why don't we put it up here?

28:10.481 --> 28:11.815
Yeah, the, uh...

28:11.940 --> 28:14.318
the garbage and the rats
will be really impressed.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.862
(sighs)

28:16.987 --> 28:19.365
Come here.

28:19.490 --> 28:22.618
I say we do it where people
can actually see it.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.335
All right.
You're on.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.090
(glass breaking)

28:42.346 --> 28:44.890
(grunting) Oh.

28:47.560 --> 28:51.313
(grunting)

28:51.438 --> 28:52.606
(yelling)

28:54.650 --> 28:56.527
(clears throat)

28:56.652 --> 28:58.487
Now... okay.

28:58.612 --> 28:59.405
There must be a light

28:59.530 --> 29:01.198
or a desk lamp
or something or...

29:01.323 --> 29:03.367
(thudding)
Ow! Oh!

29:03.492 --> 29:05.327
Oh.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.704
A flashlight. Thank you.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.954
(buzzing)

29:08.080 --> 29:10.040
Okay, not a flashlight.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.834
All right.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.753
(sighs)

29:15.795 --> 29:18.716
(sighs)

29:18.840 --> 29:20.759
Okay.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.886
(sighing)

29:27.099 --> 29:27.849
Oh.

29:27.974 --> 29:30.018
(panting)

29:37.443 --> 29:39.695
Son of a bitch is married.

29:39.819 --> 29:41.238
Okay, dude, you were right.

29:41.363 --> 29:44.824
That looks
so good up there.

29:44.950 --> 29:45.867
(siren toots)

29:45.992 --> 29:47.077
Run!

29:47.202 --> 29:48.621
(siren wailing)

29:56.086 --> 29:58.422
(grunting)

29:59.965 --> 30:01.133
(grunts)

30:01.258 --> 30:02.593
(alarm sounding)
Oh, my...

30:02.718 --> 30:03.761
(fabric tearing)
Oh!

30:03.885 --> 30:06.346
Ohh!

30:06.472 --> 30:08.098
Seriously?!

30:08.223 --> 30:09.642
(panting)

30:15.689 --> 30:17.691
Over there.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.194
(siren wailing)

30:29.244 --> 30:31.079
(sighs)
(laughs)

30:31.204 --> 30:33.582
(both laughing)

30:48.263 --> 30:49.807
Oh. Hi.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.933
I was just taking inventory.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.893
Come back tomorrow.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.604
There's a sale on... handcuffs.

30:57.481 --> 31:00.859
Oh, I see you brought your own.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.575
Oh! You don't understand;
I really do work here.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.410
I don't know your life, lady,
but I do know that

31:10.536 --> 31:12.496
I come in here all the time
and I've never seen you.

31:12.621 --> 31:13.913
O-Okay, Officer, please.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.624
If I don't get out of here
right now and warn her,

31:15.749 --> 31:17.710
my sister is going to make
a huge mistake.

31:17.835 --> 31:18.377
Then call her
from the station.

31:18.502 --> 31:19.503
Somebody's got to
post your bail.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.421
No, if she finds
out I was arrested,

31:21.547 --> 31:23.382
it'll blow my cover story,
and I'll look like an idiot.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.300
You get one phone call;
do what you have to do.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.844
This is just stupid!

31:31.264 --> 31:32.641
(footsteps approaching)

31:35.268 --> 31:36.269
(clears throat)

31:36.395 --> 31:38.731
This is a
$40,000 bag?

31:38.856 --> 31:40.524
Thirty-seven five.

31:40.649 --> 31:41.400
You peeked.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.402
Well, it's very,
very pretty,

31:43.527 --> 31:45.738
but you have to
take it back.

31:45.863 --> 31:47.531
Well, you know what that means.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.949
I'm not wasting my time
with a guilt-ridden heiress.

31:50.075 --> 31:53.953
Well, I'm not spending my time
with a self-indulgent jerk.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.331
What was the whole point of
this little exercise, anyway?

31:56.456 --> 31:59.042
To get me to admit that I'm not
comfortable with this money?

31:59.167 --> 32:00.293
Fine. I admit it.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.546
I want to earn what I have.

32:02.671 --> 32:06.925
I want to build something that
is lasting and meaningful.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.803
And not just so Marla's death
means something,

32:09.928 --> 32:11.971
but so my life
means something, too.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.933
Well, I happen to believe life
means something if you enjoy it.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.436
And is that what
you're doing right now?

32:17.561 --> 32:19.020
'Cause you just look
lonely and bored.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.690
Look, I thought that

32:21.815 --> 32:24.109
you helping me start
all this would make it easier,

32:24.234 --> 32:25.611
but you know what?

32:25.736 --> 32:26.612
Building something on my own

32:26.737 --> 32:29.573
is going to be
that much more satisfying.

32:36.246 --> 32:39.917
I still don't understand
why they would arrest you.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.961
And why you were wearing this
when I called.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.170
(chuckles)

32:44.296 --> 32:45.923
Well, I find it
keeps me sharp,

32:46.047 --> 32:47.549
you know,
when I'm thinking about

32:47.674 --> 32:49.134
hors d'oeuvres and menus and...

32:51.010 --> 32:52.095
...other things.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.973
Okay, I haven't been
completely honest.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.475
I don't have an office,
I don't have employees.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.685
I made all of this up because
I really wanted this job.

32:58.811 --> 33:02.940
William, this is
incredibly embarrassing.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.525
I hope you know I had
nothing to do with this.

33:05.651 --> 33:06.902
And I hope this doesn't

33:07.026 --> 33:09.070
ruin the rest of our evening.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.071
No.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.907
Jen, wait.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.408
You know what, you're annoying,
you really are,

33:13.533 --> 33:15.577
but you're my sister,
and I can't let you do this.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.790
I believe that belongs to you.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.375
I found it in
your wallet,

33:22.501 --> 33:24.210
where you probably stuffed it
before our meeting.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.880
(clears throat)

33:27.005 --> 33:28.006
Yeah.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.634
I thought you said
that you weren't married.

33:30.759 --> 33:34.554
No, I said there was
no Mrs. Paddington.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.973
My wife kept her maiden name.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.016
Oh. Okay.

33:38.141 --> 33:41.436
WILLIAM: Well...

33:41.561 --> 33:44.439
Unfortunately, it looks like
none of our party planning

33:44.564 --> 33:46.316
is going to work out
after all.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.653
Yeah.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.950
Y-You know what,
I think it will.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.369
You're gonna let
my sister here

33:57.494 --> 34:00.038
plan your silly little party,
or your wife is going to get

34:00.163 --> 34:03.249
a very interesting
phone call from me.

34:08.714 --> 34:09.672
(clears throat)

34:09.797 --> 34:11.090
(chuckles)

34:11.216 --> 34:12.634
(waves lapping)

34:15.344 --> 34:16.054
Hey.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.389
Heard about NYU.

34:17.514 --> 34:18.431
Congrats.

34:18.556 --> 34:19.766
Thanks.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.351
I actually just got
some good news, too.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.768
I'm gonna be in a movie.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.521
It's not a huge part,
but if it gets me noticed,

34:24.646 --> 34:26.063
it's worth putting myself
out there.

34:26.188 --> 34:27.607
Wow.

34:27.733 --> 34:28.984
This is a whole new Liam.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.193
Yeah.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.820
I guess, ever since my accident,

34:31.945 --> 34:34.112
I just want to not worry
about stuff so much.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.239
You know? I want
to live every day

34:35.364 --> 34:37.993
like it could be my last.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.786
Wow, that sounds really morbid.

34:39.911 --> 34:44.041
No, no, actually, it...
sounds like a good idea.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.250
Why spend time
planning for a future

34:45.375 --> 34:47.210
you might not even have?

34:47.335 --> 34:50.295
Yeah, something like that.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.257
Hmm.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.888
You all right?

34:58.013 --> 34:59.723
Absolutely.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.975
I'm just saying, people should
live every day to the fullest,

35:02.100 --> 35:03.476
no matter what.

35:06.063 --> 35:10.859
I guess I'm just not sure yet
if that means going to NYU.

35:10.984 --> 35:13.862
It's what I've wanted
for so long,

35:13.987 --> 35:16.823
and now that I've got it, I...

35:16.949 --> 35:18.491
I feel like
I don't know anything.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.160
Hmm.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.080
Well, you don't have to
figure everything out

35:23.204 --> 35:24.831
right this second.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.223
Not everything.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.360
Hi.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.988
Hey.

35:56.113 --> 35:57.697
(chuckles)

35:57.823 --> 36:00.784
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.370
Okay, and I hope that you're not
still mad at me, because...
Nah.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.958
Um, well, this is actually
kind of embarrassing, uh...

36:08.083 --> 36:11.920
Do you think that maybe you want
to give me my job back?

36:12.045 --> 36:13.797
Ade, I can't do that.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.507
Oh.
Not because
I'm mad at you,

36:15.632 --> 36:18.384
but because I actually
already gave your job away.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.346
I'm, uh, I'm in this movie
that starts rehearsals today.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.348
Wow.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.475
Well, your auditions
must be going pretty well.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.019
Actually, I didn't
even audition for this one.

36:27.144 --> 36:28.186
Vanessa was at The Carrington,

36:28.311 --> 36:29.187
and happened to bump
into the producer.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.857
Wait, The Carrington?

36:31.982 --> 36:33.733
Yeah, I guess
he had seen my billboards

36:33.859 --> 36:35.360
and that rescue video,

36:35.485 --> 36:36.695
and, uh, I don't know,

36:36.820 --> 36:38.613
she somehow convinced him
that I'm the guy.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.281
She's pretty amazing,
don't you think?

36:40.406 --> 36:43.076
Yeah, she certainly seems to be.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.040
Why are you being so weird
about coming back down here?
I'm not.

36:48.165 --> 36:49.749
You had fun, right?
Yeah, obviously it was exciting.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.377
Okay, I just don't want
you getting the wrong idea.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.087
I'm not ready to start coming
down here with you all the time

36:54.212 --> 36:56.965
and, you know...

36:57.090 --> 37:00.135
Oh, wow.

37:00.259 --> 37:02.554
IVY: That looks amazing
in the light.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.681
DIEGO: Well, you're not the only
one who thinks so.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.480
On second thought,

37:12.605 --> 37:14.315
what are you doing tonight?

37:25.035 --> 37:27.412
I cannot believe I get a
whole trailer, just for me.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.206
Are you kidding me?
It's hideous.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.123
It's fine.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.917
I like shag carpet.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.211
Liam, you are on a
bullet train
to stardom.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.546
She's right, this is major.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.839
Finally, someone
around here who knows

37:37.964 --> 37:39.174
what they're talking about.

37:39.298 --> 37:40.926
All right,
I'm gonna speak to Lee

37:41.051 --> 37:42.260
about getting you an upgrade.
Oh, my...

37:44.596 --> 37:45.680
Liam, thank you so much

37:45.805 --> 37:47.807
for getting me the
interview for this P.A. job.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.142
I'm just glad it worked out,

37:49.267 --> 37:51.603
if this is what
you really wanted.
It is.

37:51.728 --> 37:54.106
Why should I wait four years
to learn about filmmaking

37:54.231 --> 37:56.315
in a classroom, when I can
actually start doing it?

37:57.734 --> 37:59.652
Live the dream like
there's no tomorrow.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.613
Well, it definitely
feels like a dream.

38:11.873 --> 38:12.832
What do you want?

38:12.958 --> 38:14.876
Six years ago,

38:15.001 --> 38:17.170
I tried to start a magazine.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.839
This very cutting-edge, brainy,

38:19.965 --> 38:21.800
politically-minded thing,

38:21.925 --> 38:23.635
that could not have been

38:23.760 --> 38:25.887
a bigger flop.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.056
I believe
my mother called it

38:28.181 --> 38:29.557
the Dilettante Monthly.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.476
Ouch.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.270
Yeah.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.980
Well, I tried to earn on my own,

38:35.105 --> 38:36.856
and I failed.

38:39.109 --> 38:41.402
I've been afraid...

38:41.527 --> 38:43.738
to be involved
with anything since.

38:43.863 --> 38:44.781
But I don't know--

38:44.906 --> 38:48.618
there's something
about your little project here

38:48.743 --> 38:52.580
that I just don't want to see
you fail as miserably as I did.

38:52.705 --> 38:56.042
Well, that is
very generous of you.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.961
So, what do you say?

38:58.086 --> 39:00.755
Do you want to be partners?

39:06.970 --> 39:07.846
Good morning.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.555
Morning.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.890
I'm glad to see
you didn't sleep

39:11.016 --> 39:12.225
in the God-awful
Catwoman costume.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.769
(laughs) I almost had to.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.229
It was so hard to get off.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.897
Oh, my God, now I'm all itchy.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.151
Naomi, you have
to be honest with me.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.194
Is it really that hard

39:22.319 --> 39:24.279
for you to get a job?

39:24.403 --> 39:27.866
I mean, what was the point
of going to such extremes?

39:27.991 --> 39:29.492
Maybe I just wanted
to do something

39:29.617 --> 39:31.369
that would impress
you for once.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.497
Come on.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.375
Are you saying
that this was all about me?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.336
No, of course not.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.296
Oh, Naomi.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.840
What do you want me to do,

39:43.965 --> 39:46.134
give you a round of applause?

39:46.259 --> 39:48.803
I think this whole little
business that you've created

39:48.928 --> 39:50.555
is impressive.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.726
I think this house that
you've bought is impressive.

39:54.851 --> 39:58.479
And all these friends you have
who absolutely adore you....

39:59.605 --> 40:01.774
I think it's
all very impressive.

40:05.444 --> 40:06.988
You really mean that?

40:08.323 --> 40:10.742
Yeah, I do.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.038
Maybe if you weren't so intent
on finding a husband,

40:15.163 --> 40:17.207
you could so something
with your life, too.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.541
I mean, look at me.

40:18.666 --> 40:19.751
I gave up chasing boys,

40:19.876 --> 40:20.960
and now I channel
all of my energy

40:21.086 --> 40:22.921
into a career.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.631
I'm just saying...

40:25.757 --> 40:27.217
you don't need a man,

40:27.342 --> 40:28.385
and neither do I.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.262
We can be a team.
(laughs)

40:38.228 --> 40:39.604
Oh.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.606
Oh, um, I'm here with Annie.

40:41.731 --> 40:44.650
We're working
on a charity project together.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.027
I'm Preston.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.029
I'm Naomi Clark.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.031
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Preston.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.908
The pleasure's all mine.
