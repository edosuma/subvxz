00:00.080 --> 00:02.013
<i>Previously on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:02.266 --> 00:04.224
I always wanted to be a good cop,

00:04.226 --> 00:05.850
but there's no straight line to that.

00:06.037 --> 00:09.004
There's a rat on my team!

00:09.006 --> 00:11.207
<i>Wozniak's convinced
that Saperstein's the mole.</i>

00:11.209 --> 00:13.809
<i>I got a pretty good idea how that ends.</i>

00:13.811 --> 00:15.878
If I hadn't agreed to be an informant...

00:15.880 --> 00:17.446
if I would've just gone to Wozniak

00:17.448 --> 00:18.848
right after you arrested me...

00:18.850 --> 00:20.916
You'd be in jail... or dead.

00:20.918 --> 00:23.118
I really am who you think I am.

00:23.120 --> 00:26.019
I'm also someone
that you'd swear I'm not.

00:26.021 --> 00:28.905
Tell me the whole truth,
or I shoot you right here.

00:28.930 --> 00:30.362
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.847
You know me!

00:31.849 --> 00:33.716
- Who is she?
- She's an escort.

00:33.718 --> 00:35.668
<i>She says he calls her Harlee.</i>

00:35.670 --> 00:37.636
- I need some information.
- What do you hope I know?

00:37.638 --> 00:39.614
Are you offering
to bankroll a fresh start?

00:39.616 --> 00:41.494
<i>I can get it,
but that has to happen away</i>

00:41.519 --> 00:42.468
<i>from me and Cristina.</i>

00:42.493 --> 00:46.262
Miguel is a calculating,
unforgiving monster.

00:46.264 --> 00:48.531
I lied to you
about him being your father,

00:48.533 --> 00:50.499
but I was just trying to keep you safe.

00:50.501 --> 00:53.736
I always told myself that
the end would justify the means.

00:53.738 --> 00:55.604
We're really gonna steal $12 million

00:55.606 --> 00:57.173
<i>of confiscated drug money?</i>

00:58.643 --> 01:00.467
How do you stop the pain?

01:00.492 --> 01:01.690
What now?

01:01.692 --> 01:03.112
But now that I'm at the end,

01:03.486 --> 01:05.013
I can't justify anything.

01:05.016 --> 01:06.415
What's Aunt Gemma doing here?

01:06.417 --> 01:08.104
You're gonna be staying
with her for a while.

01:08.129 --> 01:09.013
What?

01:09.015 --> 01:11.120
<i> I cut a deal.</i>
I'm turning myself in for the crew.

01:11.122 --> 01:13.878
I cut the same deal, Harlee.

01:13.918 --> 01:16.085
<i>- You can't do this.
- It was me all along.</i>

01:16.087 --> 01:17.753
I was the mole.

01:17.755 --> 01:19.805
It happened so slowly, I didn't realize.

01:20.808 --> 01:22.145
<i>What, now we're gonna add</i>

01:22.189 --> 01:23.496
breaking and entering to your rap sheet?

01:23.498 --> 01:24.627
I was invited, Officer.

01:24.629 --> 01:26.163
Got my own key.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

01:33.513 --> 01:35.013
I told you to stay away from her.

01:35.015 --> 01:38.116
- She's almost a grown woman.
- She can decide for herself.

01:38.118 --> 01:40.818
Do you really think
you can pay me to slink away

01:40.820 --> 01:41.786
- and wash away your sins...
- I won't let you.

01:41.788 --> 01:43.922
Ten years!

01:43.924 --> 01:46.791
Ten years you have dictated
how I live my life.

01:46.793 --> 01:48.713
Now I dictate how you live yours.

01:49.295 --> 01:50.795
I know you.

01:50.797 --> 01:53.898
I'm the only one who really knows you.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.967
You're gonna take everything I give you,

01:55.969 --> 01:57.936
and you're gonna act like you like it,

01:57.938 --> 02:00.438
and you're gonna beg for more.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.640
And I'm not just gonna punish you.

02:04.945 --> 02:06.644
I'm gonna punish...

02:07.714 --> 02:11.449
That precious little girl of ours.

02:11.451 --> 02:13.851
No need to cry.

02:13.853 --> 02:15.910
Daddy's home.

Cristina.

03:03.837 --> 03:05.770
Hi, baby.

03:08.059 --> 03:09.559
Hello?

03:56.008 --> 03:57.645
All right, time to go.

04:18.630 --> 04:23.266
Detective Matt Wozniak
delivers himself to the FBI.

04:23.708 --> 04:24.807
Come on, let's go.

04:24.844 --> 04:27.907
Yeah, he wears martyrdom
pretty well for a dirty cop.

04:33.219 --> 04:35.378
I have to remove your badge now.

04:43.912 --> 04:44.844
You're light, Lieutenant.

04:44.846 --> 04:46.145
You promised me all $12 million

04:46.147 --> 04:48.081
of that stolen DEA money.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.216
Might be missing a finder's fee.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.903
Sorry, Sap.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.506
You're gonna have to cover
for me one more time.

05:23.627 --> 05:24.759
NYPD!

05:30.400 --> 05:31.599
What took you so long?

05:34.571 --> 05:38.439
Some criminals wear masks,
some wear badges,

05:38.441 --> 05:42.310
and some, in the public trust,
do it with a wave and a smile.

05:42.312 --> 05:43.932
What is it you want?

05:44.699 --> 05:46.748
If you can't get me the mastermind

05:47.132 --> 05:48.685
behind this heist,

05:49.822 --> 05:51.553
I'm looking at exactly what I want.

05:52.171 --> 05:55.557
You gonna dress up prostitutes
to look like me too?

05:56.151 --> 05:58.960
You might have a hard time.

05:59.436 --> 06:01.963
I have a very specific look.

06:10.843 --> 06:13.241
Lieutenant, what hurts more,
being in those chains

06:13.243 --> 06:15.226
or knowing who it was who put you there?

06:15.228 --> 06:18.431
The chains are temporary.

06:18.456 --> 06:20.051
Pretty thick case file
that says otherwise.

06:20.053 --> 06:21.836
Then call the NYPD.

06:21.838 --> 06:24.372
Make the announcement.
You have the money.

06:24.374 --> 06:26.941
You have your arrest. Case closed.

06:27.208 --> 06:30.659
- I could do that...
- or...

06:30.661 --> 06:33.648
Or you could recognize
that I usually lead this dance.

06:33.650 --> 06:37.741
I'm not in a holding cell,
and I haven't heard my rights.

06:37.743 --> 06:41.969
So I'm gonna ask you again.
What is it you want?

06:48.629 --> 06:50.565
I could use a dirty cop.

07:06.919 --> 07:08.147
Did you bring the chisel?

07:08.149 --> 07:09.848
Here you go.

07:15.215 --> 07:16.522
You don't have to stay for this.

07:52.465 --> 07:54.132
<i>- Hello?
- Dad?</i>

08:19.324 --> 08:22.546
I can't add anything more
to what Captain McManus said.

08:22.613 --> 08:24.814
The perpetrators
of this armored car heist

08:24.816 --> 08:26.215
- are still at large.
- Councilwoman Ayres,

08:26.217 --> 08:27.883
do you believe
they're still in the city?

08:27.885 --> 08:29.819
Mm, $12-million payday...

08:29.821 --> 08:31.854
I'm guessing an island somewhere.

08:31.856 --> 08:34.490
But that will not stop us
from trying to find them.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.705
- Whoa, hold on.
- Sorry, folks,

08:38.730 --> 08:41.342
but I haven't worn a badge
in about three years.

08:41.432 --> 08:42.664
Since when do we hold press conferences

08:42.667 --> 08:46.221
on cases with no arrests
or suspect information?

08:46.415 --> 08:48.548
Since Julia decided to run for mayor

08:48.550 --> 08:50.150
as a "tough on crime" candidate.

08:50.152 --> 08:51.318
She never did have the best timing.

08:51.343 --> 08:54.318
Well, just be grateful about
the no suspect information part.

08:54.499 --> 08:56.888
Councilwoman, is your presence here

08:56.913 --> 09:00.721
a mayoral campaign appearance
or a favor to the NYPD?

09:00.741 --> 09:03.308
I just like spending quality
time with all you people.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.233
You don't have to kick
the door off the hinges, Harlee.

09:11.235 --> 09:12.701
I'm always happy to see you.

09:12.703 --> 09:14.756
I want to see Wozniak now.

09:14.758 --> 09:16.505
Haven't even had my coffee yet.

09:16.894 --> 09:18.093
Fix you a cup?

09:19.213 --> 09:20.179
Where is he?

09:20.181 --> 09:21.013
You already know the answer to that one.

09:21.015 --> 09:23.315
Downtown off-site somewhere?

09:23.317 --> 09:25.251
He's in federal custody.

09:25.253 --> 09:26.852
- All right, well, get dressed.
- Take me to him.

09:26.854 --> 09:28.988
I can't do that, and you know that.

09:28.990 --> 09:30.956
Look, you made your choices. He did too.

09:30.958 --> 09:32.625
Wozniak's on his own now.

09:32.627 --> 09:36.195
Look, this is a man
with a family and a job.

09:36.197 --> 09:38.164
You can't just bury him
in a hole somewhere

09:38.166 --> 09:40.132
without an explanation.

09:40.431 --> 09:41.815
Harlee...

09:42.943 --> 09:45.704
this isn't some kind
of black bag operation.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.611
Other than a little sleep deprivation,

09:47.613 --> 09:49.991
your mentor is
completely safe physically.

09:49.993 --> 09:52.725
Though that, uh, elevated ego
is prohibiting him

09:52.750 --> 09:54.134
from comprehending his predicament.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.187
Come on.

10:02.660 --> 10:03.859
What's that?

10:03.861 --> 10:05.646
This your malpractice confession

10:05.648 --> 10:08.097
for the Civil War surgery
you did on my shoulder?

10:08.099 --> 10:10.165
Thought you were on
self-appointed desk duty.

10:10.167 --> 10:11.793
Sitting gets me closer to the ground

10:11.795 --> 10:13.235
for when I got to pass out.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.970
If it's that bad, go home.

10:14.972 --> 10:17.339
You were shot too, you know,
so don't put it all on me.

10:17.341 --> 10:19.241
Woz wanted me to make an appearance.

10:19.690 --> 10:22.077
It'd be nice if he made an appearance.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.590
Harlee, have you heard from Woz?

10:24.592 --> 10:26.148
I tried him three times today.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.951
He's probably going hard after
Donnie and the heist money.

10:28.953 --> 10:30.735
It's almost 4:00.

10:30.821 --> 10:32.958
- Is anybody else worried?
- Yeah, for Donnie Pomp.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.202
I don't care if you're
Internal Affairs or the pope.

10:35.204 --> 10:37.371
You double-cross Woz,
that's a death wish.

11:30.159 --> 11:33.193
<i>- Wozniak.
- Don't ruin my day.</i>

11:45.167 --> 11:46.901
That didn't take long.

11:48.563 --> 11:49.662
You comfortable?

11:53.525 --> 11:54.864
What happened?

11:56.006 --> 11:58.118
I've been asking myself
the same question.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.660
Let's go.

12:03.247 --> 12:05.793
Woz. Woz.

12:05.795 --> 12:07.628
Woz, wait.

12:08.247 --> 12:10.175
- Where are we going?
- For a ride.

12:15.716 --> 12:17.516
What happened with Stahl?

12:20.385 --> 12:22.452
You know, when I didn't hear
from you this morning,

12:22.454 --> 12:23.837
I thought...

12:24.470 --> 12:26.122
You were free of it all?

12:26.124 --> 12:27.868
I thought maybe...

12:29.661 --> 12:31.294
I really lost you.

12:35.867 --> 12:38.118
That was a brave thing you did.

12:39.078 --> 12:43.438
It was crazy... but brave.

12:49.251 --> 12:50.814
I said good-bye to Cristina.

12:51.386 --> 12:52.861
You know, I sent her to my sister's.

12:52.886 --> 12:54.951
I was turning myself in.
You know that, right?

13:04.302 --> 13:06.296
What did Stahl say when you
brought up the prostitute?

13:06.856 --> 13:09.599
That was a great tip, Harlee.

13:09.601 --> 13:11.334
He rolled right over.

13:11.906 --> 13:13.803
Then why did they let you go?

13:14.711 --> 13:16.736
Who said they let me go?

13:26.029 --> 13:27.629
What is this place?

13:27.631 --> 13:29.197
Hand me my kit.

13:32.425 --> 13:33.835
What did you agree to do?

13:33.837 --> 13:35.270
Backseat.

13:38.305 --> 13:40.141
I made a mistake

13:40.570 --> 13:44.872
of not coming to you
as soon as the Feds arrested me.

13:46.666 --> 13:48.039
I made a mistake

13:48.308 --> 13:50.518
thinking I could
fix this mess on my own,

13:50.893 --> 13:53.590
that I could string the Feds along

13:53.592 --> 13:56.480
and keep everything in flux

13:56.505 --> 13:58.693
until I could figure
a way out for everyone...

13:58.695 --> 14:02.076
for me, for you,
for the crew, and Cristina.

14:06.051 --> 14:07.940
But I couldn't. I...

14:08.317 --> 14:10.517
It only got worse.

14:15.338 --> 14:16.593
Whatever...

14:18.645 --> 14:20.094
this thing is that you have to handle,

14:20.096 --> 14:22.192
you don't have to do it by yourself.

14:23.489 --> 14:24.976
We'll figure it out...

14:26.568 --> 14:27.694
together.

14:33.863 --> 14:36.994
<i>Okay, what's my tell?</i>

14:37.541 --> 14:39.972
<i>What is this thing that I do
that has you so sure</i>

14:39.974 --> 14:42.766
<i>that I'm a Fed mole
that you would kill me?</i>

14:43.654 --> 14:47.671
<i>You push your hair behind your ear.</i>

14:48.267 --> 14:49.940
<i>This is a joke, right?</i>

14:50.559 --> 14:52.155
<i>I've been pushing my hair behind my ear</i>

14:52.157 --> 14:53.030
<i>since kindergarten.</i>

14:53.845 --> 14:55.860
<i>I also lick my lips, bite my nails.</i>

14:55.885 --> 14:58.836
<i>- Don't!
- Don't... don't twist this around.</i>

14:58.838 --> 15:00.771
<i>- Don't.
- There's nothing to twist.</i>

15:00.773 --> 15:02.765
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

15:03.409 --> 15:04.525
<i>You know me.</i>

15:04.527 --> 15:06.444
<i>- You lied to me.
- You lied to me again!</i>

15:06.446 --> 15:09.972
<i>It kills me that somebody's
trying to hurt you.</i>

15:11.317 --> 15:13.220
You wore a wire.

15:14.954 --> 15:16.387
A wire!

15:18.954 --> 15:20.391
I didn't know what else to do.

15:27.049 --> 15:30.935
Dispatch, this is Tango one-zero-one

15:30.960 --> 15:33.360
requesting backup for a 10-34.

15:33.362 --> 15:36.119
Assault in progress at 952 Vermont.

15:36.121 --> 15:38.732
Pursuing suspect. Victim is down.

15:38.734 --> 15:40.568
Woz, listen to me.

15:40.570 --> 15:43.437
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

15:54.534 --> 15:56.233
Woz!

15:56.235 --> 15:57.501
What are you doing?

16:00.339 --> 16:02.206
Who is this?

16:02.208 --> 16:03.523
I don't know.

16:03.825 --> 16:06.977
Someone attacked him
and went through that door.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.815
And did we see that?

16:12.817 --> 16:15.853
- No.
- There's blood on the handle.

16:16.499 --> 16:18.055
And you're sure
you want to walk through it?

16:18.057 --> 16:20.659
You made that choice for me.

16:22.543 --> 16:23.894
Woz, wait.

16:24.414 --> 16:27.935
- Just tell me what this is.
- Because nothing is for free.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.705
Hey, police. Out.

16:37.573 --> 16:39.984
A mobster named Bianchi
closes the restaurant

16:40.009 --> 16:41.942
every Monday for a private dinner.

16:41.944 --> 16:43.368
Michael Bianchi?

16:43.475 --> 16:45.591
He's not just some mobster.
He runs Brooklyn.

16:45.616 --> 16:49.350
Woz, this is a world of hurt
for all of us.

16:49.352 --> 16:52.654
- I'll hold him.
- You frisk him.

16:53.417 --> 16:54.898
Is this what you need?

16:55.679 --> 16:57.391
This will prove my loyalty?

16:57.810 --> 16:59.193
Your door.

17:16.011 --> 17:17.290
NYPD!

17:18.698 --> 17:21.243
- Police!
- Ah, stop right there.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.488
- Hands up!
- Put your hands where I can see'em.

17:22.512 --> 17:25.227
Hands up! Get 'em up. Up!

17:25.229 --> 17:26.729
Big boy, get up.

17:27.964 --> 17:28.898
How's the capellini?

17:28.900 --> 17:30.570
- Oh, it's excellent.
- Can I help you?

17:30.572 --> 17:32.401
You're under arrest, Michael.

17:32.403 --> 17:34.670
- You ought to know what to do.
- Against the wall now.

17:34.672 --> 17:35.571
Now!

17:36.271 --> 17:39.668
You spilled
the Giacomo Conterno Monfortino.

17:40.077 --> 17:41.590
I have killed people for less.

17:41.615 --> 17:43.422
Yeah, you must be a big hit
with the waiters.

17:43.447 --> 17:45.348
What's the beef with the guy outside?

17:45.350 --> 17:46.849
You weren't gonna call paramedics?

17:46.851 --> 17:48.499
- Come again?
- Shut up!

17:54.692 --> 17:56.358
Interesting dining utensil.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.925
Smooth plant, sweetheart.

17:57.927 --> 17:59.645
Bet you say that to all the ladies.

18:27.185 --> 18:29.565
Not too late to grab a beer
and play nice.

18:29.598 --> 18:31.264
Ha-ha.

18:31.266 --> 18:33.867
Your date gets wine. I get beer.

18:33.869 --> 18:35.786
I see where I stand.

18:36.371 --> 18:37.804
Why'd you come calling?

18:38.465 --> 18:40.800
Little out of your trailer park,
aren't you?

18:41.760 --> 18:45.645
My dad used to say,
"Beat your kid every day.

18:45.647 --> 18:49.004
If you don't know
the reason why, they will."

18:49.006 --> 18:50.874
So you're settling a score?

18:50.876 --> 18:52.585
I'm providing a service.

18:52.587 --> 18:53.553
Wow.

18:53.555 --> 18:55.655
Must be a serious debt,

18:55.680 --> 18:57.680
considering the fuse you're lighting.

18:58.128 --> 19:01.294
Everybody's got to pay up
their debt eventually.

19:01.712 --> 19:04.381
Character is how you face it.

19:04.899 --> 19:08.168
Well, this character
doesn't take a bad charge.

19:08.616 --> 19:10.955
I don't do time
for the deeds I actually do.

19:10.957 --> 19:12.739
A frame job's never gonna stick.

19:13.446 --> 19:15.836
Consider it a moment of reflection.

19:15.838 --> 19:17.243
Oh.

19:18.085 --> 19:23.183
Think of a place
where you feel safe, whole.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.995
Someday that place will be violated,

19:25.997 --> 19:29.489
and when you're lying
on your back, bleeding out,

19:30.336 --> 19:33.228
you can reflect on why you chose
not to get that beer.

19:33.230 --> 19:35.562
Ooh.

19:36.577 --> 19:37.992
I drink whiskey.

19:40.408 --> 19:43.995
Isn't your desk down the hall
in the cubicle outside?

19:44.142 --> 19:45.669
Well, I'm thinking of trading it in

19:45.671 --> 19:46.910
for something with a view.

19:46.912 --> 19:48.745
Careful.

19:48.747 --> 19:51.181
Pride comes before the fall.

19:51.574 --> 19:54.284
Wozniak just took Bianchi into custody.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.222
Does he know
what he's getting himself into?

19:59.776 --> 20:00.909
Do we want him to?

20:02.761 --> 20:04.794
Bianchi's lawyer
just gave me a dissertation

20:04.796 --> 20:06.963
on the Fourth Amendment
and probable cause.

20:06.965 --> 20:10.460
- We had probable cause.
- Follow the blood trail.

20:10.462 --> 20:12.313
A highly suspicious blood trail.

20:12.315 --> 20:14.419
I'm gonna pretend I don't know
what you mean by that.

20:14.444 --> 20:15.977
We need to notify the DEA's office

20:15.979 --> 20:17.912
before you arrest
a high-profile Mafia figure.

20:17.914 --> 20:20.503
- We could have coordinated this.
- What can I say?

20:20.505 --> 20:22.533
Bad guys don't keep bankers' hours.

20:22.558 --> 20:23.532
Organized crime always brings

20:23.557 --> 20:25.320
jurisdictional issues
with the U.S. Attorney.

20:25.322 --> 20:27.067
Yeah, Feds and lawyers,

20:27.069 --> 20:29.057
two people I'm desperate to please.

20:35.214 --> 20:36.696
Was he expecting a thank-you card?

20:37.248 --> 20:38.643
Today's full of surprises.

20:38.668 --> 20:40.735
Yeah, like a must-win
aggravated assault charge.

20:40.737 --> 20:43.337
Perform or perish.

20:43.578 --> 20:44.775
We perished last time.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.479
A few years ago, Bianchi lost a bet

20:46.481 --> 20:47.580
to one of his soldiers.

20:47.618 --> 20:49.315
Yeah, instead of paying up,
he beat him to death.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.617
Also beat the charge.
I've heard the bedtime story.

20:51.619 --> 20:53.753
Did you hear the U.S. Attorney
had him on motive,

20:53.755 --> 20:56.250
opportunity, and DNA on the weapon?

20:56.889 --> 20:59.125
Then why isn't he doing life upstate?

20:59.127 --> 21:00.126
Hurricane Sandy.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.761
The weapon was lost in the flooding.

21:01.763 --> 21:02.945
Grand jury didn't indict.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.767
They haven't been able
to lay a glove on him since.

21:05.420 --> 21:08.067
So tell me, is this charge solid?

21:08.069 --> 21:10.756
- Barring a natural disaster?
- You know what I'm asking.

21:13.657 --> 21:15.207
He won't walk away from this one.

21:20.180 --> 21:21.604
Uh, speaking of walking away,

21:21.606 --> 21:23.748
I decided not to make it
so easy for you.

21:25.009 --> 21:27.380
Did you just transition
from murder to romance?

21:27.382 --> 21:29.872
Adeptly, I thought.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.174
Well, points for degree of difficulty.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.944
I think I can help
with your Miguel problem.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.268
Hey, I know you'd never ask for help...

21:37.695 --> 21:40.016
It's not a problem anymore, all right?

21:40.568 --> 21:42.518
I paid him to leave town. He's gone.

21:43.013 --> 21:44.438
Until the money runs out.

21:46.483 --> 21:47.649
No.

21:50.880 --> 21:51.745
It's done.

21:54.123 --> 21:56.590
Miguel and the money
are both far away right now.

22:04.706 --> 22:06.005
What don't you say we try the cuffs

22:06.007 --> 22:08.508
on you tonight, Harlee?

22:08.510 --> 22:11.413
Hmm, that could cost ya extra.

22:11.947 --> 22:13.452
Come on.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.668
Show me how special I am to you.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.194
Don't you want to frisk me first?

22:42.800 --> 22:44.546
You like being interrogated?

22:44.548 --> 22:45.996
Yes, please.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.920
I don't want to go to jail.

22:47.922 --> 22:49.449
I'll do whatever you ask.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.162
Tell me about the other cop
that interrogated you.

22:58.209 --> 23:01.826
You talked to the NYPD
about me, didn't you, Gina?

23:02.280 --> 23:03.475
No.

23:04.215 --> 23:06.316
- It's okay.
- I'm not upset about it.

23:08.086 --> 23:09.786
Not yet.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.521
But I, uh...

23:12.744 --> 23:14.844
I don't care for liars.

23:17.820 --> 23:19.963
I handle liars for a living.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.112
He threatened me in a hotel lobby.

23:22.114 --> 23:23.545
- Speak up, Gina.
- I can't hear you.

23:23.547 --> 23:25.735
He knew your name,
that you were a client.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.489
And you provided details?

23:27.491 --> 23:30.306
You shared with him
what we do here together?

23:30.823 --> 23:32.208
How much you pay me.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.240
Mm-hmm.

23:35.465 --> 23:36.564
And?

23:37.524 --> 23:38.548
The wig.

23:39.115 --> 23:41.480
That you call me Harlee. That's it.

23:43.304 --> 23:45.405
Did you sign anything?

23:46.039 --> 23:47.670
Did you make an official statement?

23:47.672 --> 23:48.741
No, I swear.

23:48.743 --> 23:51.077
- Gina.
- I swear.

23:53.865 --> 23:54.771
All right.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.682
Appreciate your candor.

23:57.522 --> 24:00.727
Unfortunately, this dirty cop
is trying to play me,

24:01.066 --> 24:02.755
so I'm gonna need you to disappear.

24:05.602 --> 24:07.393
Not like that, Gina.

24:07.395 --> 24:08.728
I mean from the city.

24:09.862 --> 24:11.094
A new adventure.

24:13.255 --> 24:16.562
Amtrak voucher, enough cash to resettle.

24:17.059 --> 24:19.593
Go to your basement apartment
in the Bronx,

24:19.595 --> 24:22.296
pack your things, and you start over.

24:22.298 --> 24:25.706
A new beginning. Agreed?

24:26.434 --> 24:28.068
I need verbal confirmation, Gina.

24:28.070 --> 24:31.238
- Yes, yes.
- Agreed.

24:31.658 --> 24:33.307
Okay, good.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.244
Now let's get started.

24:46.464 --> 24:47.956
What's your name?

24:49.014 --> 24:50.380
Harlee.

24:52.176 --> 24:53.871
All right, well,
try Gail Baker's office.

24:53.873 --> 24:56.466
Tell her that Harlee Santos
needs to speak to her right now.

24:56.566 --> 24:58.233
You can direct
any of your immediate concerns

24:58.235 --> 25:00.201
to our community relations department.

25:00.203 --> 25:02.003
This is a public safety issue.

25:02.005 --> 25:04.205
- Call the NYPD.
- I am the NYPD.

25:04.207 --> 25:05.773
We got a stalker, Ben?

25:05.775 --> 25:07.775
She miss being handled?

25:07.777 --> 25:09.342
What are you, a sadist?

25:09.642 --> 25:10.759
Girls usually get the hint

25:10.784 --> 25:12.725
after their first six
unanswered messages.

25:12.778 --> 25:16.242
You played Wozniak a copy of my wire?

25:16.502 --> 25:18.349
You handed him a recording of it?

25:18.351 --> 25:19.874
It's not yet available on iTunes.

25:20.001 --> 25:22.068
You promised to protect me.

25:22.070 --> 25:24.463
I did when you were my asset.

25:24.973 --> 25:27.740
But you graduated, didn't you?
Congratulations.

25:27.742 --> 25:29.281
Oh, so this is spite?

25:29.283 --> 25:30.777
No, this is a high-level
conspiracy case,

25:30.779 --> 25:32.011
and you played your part.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.113
Take a bow. Go home.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.901
I can't go home,

25:35.903 --> 25:37.984
not with you putting me
in Wozniak's crosshairs.

25:38.513 --> 25:39.819
You'd rather see him in jail?

25:40.168 --> 25:42.088
He had forgiven me.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.585
Every asset profiles differently...

25:44.587 --> 25:46.162
different triggers,
different weaknesses.

25:46.362 --> 25:47.661
So what, I'm collateral damage?

25:47.663 --> 25:49.730
I am simply managing my new asset.

25:49.732 --> 25:52.232
- No.
- You're dragging me back in.

25:52.234 --> 25:53.200
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was such a blast

25:53.202 --> 25:55.002
the first time around.

25:55.004 --> 25:56.503
So if it's not about me, then why?

25:56.505 --> 25:58.205
Why do you need Wozniak?

25:58.207 --> 26:01.175
You arrested me to get Wozniak
to plant evidence for you.

26:01.177 --> 26:03.477
I could've done that myself
without tearing us apart.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.910
Harlee, if I only needed a dirty cop,

26:05.912 --> 26:07.324
I'd put a doughnut on a hook.

26:07.349 --> 26:09.817
What I need is an insider,
a personal connection.

26:10.137 --> 26:11.501
The Mafia isn't your target.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.087
Gold star, Detective.

26:13.089 --> 26:14.254
Then who is?

26:22.244 --> 26:23.630
Well, that's not fair.

26:24.006 --> 26:24.872
Hey!

26:24.897 --> 26:26.567
The bad guys never stop for paperwork.

26:26.569 --> 26:29.438
Well, it's no fun if I don't
give 'em a head start.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.297
Mm, like the, uh, head start
you gave the crew

26:32.299 --> 26:33.707
to my press conference?

26:34.481 --> 26:36.610
I'm touched by the support, Woz.

26:36.612 --> 26:39.140
I didn't want to steal your spotlight

26:39.142 --> 26:41.479
with my rugged good looks.

26:41.481 --> 26:44.405
- Oh.
- Very nice.

26:44.407 --> 26:48.571
12 years of making me look good,
and I'm wedged behind the desk.

26:48.573 --> 26:52.482
If you poll above 20%,
I'll put your poster up.

26:52.516 --> 26:55.206
Yeah? Get ready to bust out some tacks.

26:55.752 --> 26:58.933
If you ever get tired of kissing babies,

26:59.656 --> 27:02.390
I might be willing to take you back.

27:02.392 --> 27:03.358
Really?

27:03.766 --> 27:06.895
Same lopsided desk and everything?

27:09.173 --> 27:11.545
We had fun on that desk.

27:12.406 --> 27:13.869
But city hall has better coffee.

27:13.871 --> 27:16.110
Yeah, but I got better booze.

27:16.806 --> 27:19.430
Hence the fun on the desk.

27:20.285 --> 27:22.177
Seriously...

27:22.645 --> 27:24.813
I could use someone I can trust.

27:24.815 --> 27:28.362
I didn't need Wozniak
to shake down the Mafia, Harlee.

27:28.387 --> 27:30.274
What I need him for
is to give me the person

27:30.276 --> 27:31.652
allowing them to operate.

27:31.855 --> 27:33.752
Wozniak agreed to give me
whomever intervenes

27:33.777 --> 27:34.910
on Bianchi's behalf.

27:34.912 --> 27:36.611
Does he know who this person is?

27:36.613 --> 27:37.611
I don't know; it's a big city,

27:37.636 --> 27:39.831
and he didn't think
to carve out exclusions.

27:40.184 --> 27:41.783
Wozniak will plant
evidence on a criminal,

27:41.785 --> 27:43.285
but he won't inform on a stranger,

27:43.287 --> 27:44.653
much less someone he cares about.

27:44.655 --> 27:46.066
- Why not?
- You did.

27:48.058 --> 27:49.591
God, I do miss that feeling, though...

27:49.593 --> 27:51.259
right before you kick in a door,

27:51.261 --> 27:53.509
not sure what's on the other side.

27:54.364 --> 27:56.264
- Nothing like it.
- Yep.

27:56.266 --> 27:58.133
So what's the occasion?

27:58.135 --> 28:01.136
You here for another photo op
by the cage?

28:01.138 --> 28:04.105
- A favor...
- the off-the-books kind.

28:18.365 --> 28:20.809
Have you signed the file on Bianchi?

28:22.514 --> 28:24.680
I haven't gotten through the "A" s yet.

28:24.682 --> 28:27.276
Maybe you could skip ahead?

28:28.162 --> 28:29.497
Assault and battery.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.466
The weapon was found at the scene.

28:31.468 --> 28:33.497
There's blood. There's prints.

28:33.499 --> 28:35.349
Woz, you really ought to give me

28:35.351 --> 28:37.044
a heads-up about this stuff.

28:37.046 --> 28:38.458
Jump on the scanner.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.499
You know, one of the things
you taught me

28:40.539 --> 28:42.237
was to pick my battles.

28:42.608 --> 28:45.275
So now let me help you pick yours.

28:45.277 --> 28:46.610
No, the crew's immunity

28:46.612 --> 28:48.912
was a condition of Wozniak's surrender.

28:48.914 --> 28:50.481
New deal, new conditions.

28:50.483 --> 28:53.050
Don't worry, though.
You're still clear for now.

28:53.052 --> 28:55.219
How close is he to this person?

28:56.470 --> 28:58.692
Close enough that they'll never suspect.

29:00.009 --> 29:02.042
This was your plan all along?

29:06.766 --> 29:08.666
You're holding Pandora's box, Woz,

29:08.668 --> 29:11.385
and I am trying to keep it closed.

29:11.387 --> 29:13.354
Is that the one with the three bears?

29:13.356 --> 29:15.756
If you were to drop the charges...

29:15.758 --> 29:18.457
Jules, it's done.

29:18.459 --> 29:19.793
I thought you were on the "A" s.

29:19.795 --> 29:22.096
My hands are more tied than his.

29:22.098 --> 29:23.398
Trust me.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.099
It's... it's been less than 24 hours.

29:25.101 --> 29:27.101
He... he hasn't been transferred
to Central Booking...

29:27.103 --> 29:29.570
Jules, listen to me.

29:30.965 --> 29:33.605
I can't do it.

29:37.486 --> 29:38.846
Okay.

29:39.565 --> 29:40.793
It's no problem.

29:43.369 --> 29:46.282
I, um... I better get going and, uh,

29:46.307 --> 29:48.257
find some babies to kiss or something.

29:53.107 --> 29:54.340
Home safe.

29:56.411 --> 29:58.377
Safe tomorrow.

30:06.921 --> 30:08.821
Son of a bitch.

30:33.795 --> 30:36.095
<i>I know I made you worry.</i>

30:36.641 --> 30:38.831
I didn't mean to scare you.

30:39.139 --> 30:40.850
You were scared too, Mom,

30:41.334 --> 30:44.504
like I've... like I've never
seen you before.

30:46.508 --> 30:47.673
And you were looking at me like...

30:47.675 --> 30:50.790
like it really might be
the last time you saw my face.

30:51.780 --> 30:54.174
- Sweetheart...
- It felt like good-bye.

30:55.239 --> 30:57.622
And not the "see you tomorrow" kind.

30:59.069 --> 31:00.101
What happened?

31:03.279 --> 31:05.251
<i>I thought I might be in trouble...</i>

31:07.070 --> 31:08.336
<i>the worst kind.</i>

31:22.433 --> 31:23.632
And I wanted you with Gemma

31:23.634 --> 31:26.168
because I needed to know
that you were safe.

31:26.170 --> 31:27.563
You're a cop.

31:28.406 --> 31:29.772
What could you have possibly done

31:29.774 --> 31:31.271
that would get you arrested?

31:33.844 --> 31:35.194
It was about money.

31:38.399 --> 31:39.965
<i>Me, Woz, and the crew,</i>

31:39.967 --> 31:42.412
<i>we come across a lot of it every day...</i>

31:42.954 --> 31:46.055
<i>money criminals made doing
bad things to good people.</i>

31:49.543 --> 31:50.859
What, you stole some?

31:53.197 --> 31:55.531
Yes, I did.

31:55.533 --> 31:56.799
I mean we did.

32:01.314 --> 32:03.161
It was for Miguel.

32:10.773 --> 32:12.965
<i>I knew that if I'd pay him,
he'd go away.</i>

32:19.972 --> 32:23.046
<i>So I took money from bad people</i>

32:23.048 --> 32:25.527
<i>to get a bad person out of our lives.</i>

32:35.089 --> 32:38.223
<i>Miguel?</i> Mi'jo? <i>Are you home?</i>

32:45.682 --> 32:46.755
Miguel?

32:47.575 --> 32:48.513
<i>Corazón?</i>

33:05.637 --> 33:06.737
Hello?

33:09.078 --> 33:10.255
Hello?

33:11.154 --> 33:12.130
Hello!

33:13.890 --> 33:16.702
You paid him to go away?

33:17.511 --> 33:19.265
I did it for us...

33:20.396 --> 33:21.995
for you.

33:22.832 --> 33:24.712
And you knew he'd take it.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.311
I know who he is...

33:28.504 --> 33:30.404
<i>who he really is.</i>

33:41.192 --> 33:43.417
He didn't even care enough
to say good-bye.

33:43.419 --> 33:46.824
This is on me, baby, okay?

33:47.241 --> 33:50.357
I need you safe... always.

33:50.927 --> 33:52.831
And you deserved a better father.

33:52.833 --> 33:55.362
You know, that's my fault, my choices.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.311
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

34:00.336 --> 34:02.308
I mean, you deserve
somebody better than me.

34:02.333 --> 34:03.088
Mom, no.

34:03.113 --> 34:05.046
- Yes.
- No.

34:05.048 --> 34:07.215
I don't even know how two people like us

34:07.217 --> 34:09.818
even made someone as wonderful as you.

34:11.876 --> 34:13.722
You're a miracle.

34:13.899 --> 34:16.091
Look, I am who I am because of you.

34:16.092 --> 34:17.803
- You have to know that.
- No.

34:17.804 --> 34:19.917
What I know is that I let you down,

34:20.924 --> 34:23.465
that every time I had a real choice,

34:23.467 --> 34:25.139
I chose wrong.

34:26.989 --> 34:29.228
<i>And not because I didn't know any better</i>

34:30.440 --> 34:32.001
<i>but because I didn't trust</i>

34:32.003 --> 34:33.967
<i>where the right road would take us.</i>

34:35.728 --> 34:37.879
<i>But from now on,
I'm taking the right road,</i>

34:38.407 --> 34:40.132
<i>no matter how hard it is,</i>

34:41.072 --> 34:42.804
<i>no matter where it takes us.</i>

34:47.516 --> 34:48.716
Didn't have time to think.

34:48.717 --> 34:50.585
The new stylist talked me into it.

34:50.587 --> 34:54.054
I haven't worn my hair
this short since I was your age.

34:54.364 --> 34:55.965
It looks great, Linda.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.300
- Gives your face
a whole new feel. -

34:58.302 --> 35:01.804
- Woz will love it, I'm sure.
- He won't even notice.

35:01.806 --> 35:03.839
I just felt like
it was time for a change.

35:03.841 --> 35:06.542
Hey, Cristina, where's your mom?

35:06.544 --> 35:07.980
Well, you're her boss.

35:08.005 --> 35:10.112
- You know Harlee.
- She likes to make an entrance.

35:10.114 --> 35:12.448
She wasn't home when you left?

35:12.450 --> 35:13.349
I don't know.

35:13.531 --> 35:15.426
She just reminded me
about Friday dinner.

35:15.451 --> 35:16.318
I came straight from practice.

35:16.652 --> 35:18.596
Did she mention
where she'd be coming from?

35:18.621 --> 35:22.725
Matt, this has to simmer
for at least a half hour.

35:23.197 --> 35:24.894
I'm sure she'll be fine.

35:27.598 --> 35:29.331
Are you okay?

35:29.765 --> 35:31.166
You don't seem as chipper as usual.

35:31.168 --> 35:33.669
I'm just tired, I guess.

36:37.321 --> 36:40.828
_

36:42.240 --> 36:44.240
_

36:44.758 --> 36:47.103
Is that your mom, hon?

37:23.474 --> 37:25.674
Trying to get out of setting the table?

37:28.641 --> 37:30.151
Woz...

37:31.537 --> 37:33.004
come inside.

37:34.567 --> 37:36.036
Where were you?

37:38.099 --> 37:39.899
I was stuck in traffic on Bushwick.

37:39.901 --> 37:41.400
There was, uh, construction on Myrtle.

37:41.402 --> 37:43.536
- On Myrtle.
- Yeah, I heard.

37:43.538 --> 37:47.540
Traffic...
too obvious a lie to be a lie.

37:47.542 --> 37:49.723
At least that's what I assume.

37:50.445 --> 37:51.649
It's the truth.

37:51.804 --> 37:56.382
People who have affairs
get stuck in traffic.

37:56.384 --> 37:59.652
Late for school, late for work...
there's always traffic.

37:59.654 --> 38:01.787
It's New York.

38:01.789 --> 38:02.755
I'm not lying.

38:03.196 --> 38:05.992
Well, here's a chance
to keep your streak alive.

38:05.994 --> 38:07.793
Why aren't you looking at me?

38:07.795 --> 38:09.590
Did you know?

38:10.453 --> 38:11.666
Know what?

38:12.416 --> 38:15.239
- Less convincing.
- I'll ask again.

38:16.371 --> 38:18.404
Did you know?

38:18.406 --> 38:20.406
You can ask as many times as you want.

38:20.408 --> 38:21.884
If I don't know what the question is,

38:21.886 --> 38:23.042
I can't answer it.

38:23.573 --> 38:25.568
Stahl's real target.

38:27.769 --> 38:29.197
It's Julia.

38:30.365 --> 38:32.948
- Julia who?
- Our Julia.

38:32.950 --> 38:34.622
Julia Ayres.

38:34.649 --> 38:36.382
I swear to God, Harlee,

38:36.384 --> 38:38.150
- if you know and you're not...
- I-I didn't know.

38:38.152 --> 38:39.552
It...

38:39.554 --> 38:42.121
Are you sure? Julia?

38:51.165 --> 38:53.866
I thought you were holding
the NYPD's leash.

38:53.868 --> 38:57.637
Wozniak isn't the taking-orders type.

38:57.639 --> 39:00.573
So this is what, a shakedown?

39:00.575 --> 39:05.126
Are these two cops of yours
entrepreneurs?

39:05.972 --> 39:07.310
I'd call it a mistake.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.173
This deal you made,

39:09.977 --> 39:11.297
does it include the crew's immunity?

39:11.322 --> 39:12.755
Are they on the hook for this?

39:12.757 --> 39:14.656
Do you two think you can play me?

39:14.658 --> 39:17.259
I didn't know anything about Julia.

39:17.261 --> 39:20.195
Do you think I could
ever be a rat like you?

39:20.197 --> 39:22.998
I am not in league with Stahl.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.335
He... he ruined my life. I hate him.

39:26.337 --> 39:28.570
You hate him like you love me...

39:28.572 --> 39:30.472
when it's convenient.

39:30.474 --> 39:33.693
Woz... please.

39:34.145 --> 39:36.117
You have to believe me.

39:37.048 --> 39:39.056
That night at the pier,

39:39.817 --> 39:41.383
where did you hide it?

39:44.188 --> 39:47.215
The wire, where did you hide it?

39:47.958 --> 39:49.191
My daughter's inside.

39:49.193 --> 39:51.624
Harlee, where was it?

39:51.626 --> 39:53.595
This is not the time or the place.

39:55.699 --> 39:57.866
God! Tell me.

39:57.868 --> 39:59.635
Where was it?

40:05.985 --> 40:07.639
On my back.

40:09.350 --> 40:11.281
You're a smart girl.

40:12.928 --> 40:15.579
You undress. You shame me.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.367
You make me doubt what I knew I knew.

40:18.369 --> 40:20.979
They said they would
take Cristina away from me.

40:23.093 --> 40:25.362
They said they would put me in jail.

40:25.482 --> 40:28.950
You let me push Saperstein
off a building.

40:28.952 --> 40:31.053
No, I tried to stop you!

40:31.055 --> 40:32.687
I killed him!

40:32.689 --> 40:35.223
I killed him to protect you!

40:35.225 --> 40:37.169
Stop twisting things around.

40:37.628 --> 40:39.198
You killed Saperstein

40:39.223 --> 40:41.229
because you were
out of control and paranoid.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.999
I did what I did to protect my daughter.

40:44.001 --> 40:47.436
- Harlee...
- we could've found a way.

40:48.010 --> 40:50.305
I can make your troubles go away,

40:50.307 --> 40:52.040
just like I did last time.

40:52.042 --> 40:54.298
Last time, I was guilty.

40:55.170 --> 40:57.378
Should be easier, then, shouldn't it?

41:02.186 --> 41:04.219
I prefer it never happened.

41:04.598 --> 41:07.022
Wozniak and I go way back.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.157
He stepped over a line,

41:09.759 --> 41:12.627
and I can make him
step in the other direction.

41:12.967 --> 41:14.996
Every smile,

41:15.640 --> 41:17.632
every conversation,

41:18.175 --> 41:20.206
you looked me in the eyes

41:20.208 --> 41:23.071
while you were twisting
the knife in my back.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.438
You're a liar, you're a coward,

41:26.535 --> 41:27.734
and you're a rat.

41:32.675 --> 41:34.704
You shook my hand,

41:35.044 --> 41:37.544
and you promised me
you would handle the department

41:37.546 --> 41:39.913
if I supported your ambitions.

41:39.915 --> 41:42.950
In my world, that kind of negligence

41:42.952 --> 41:45.085
is just not tolerated.

41:48.107 --> 41:50.432
Now, him, he allowed two corrupt cops

41:50.457 --> 41:53.177
to walk right up to me
and plant a weapon.

41:57.866 --> 41:59.890
Is that meant to impress me?

42:00.677 --> 42:02.566
I just need to know...

42:03.902 --> 42:05.639
that I have your attention.

42:06.055 --> 42:08.914
This is exactly why Stahl
gave you the recording...

42:08.916 --> 42:10.321
to divide us.

42:10.716 --> 42:12.029
Don't let him.

42:12.054 --> 42:13.620
If we just stick together in this...

42:13.622 --> 42:17.337
I will never trust you again... ever.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.160
I'll do anything for Julia.

42:20.162 --> 42:22.462
I will not let her go down.

42:22.464 --> 42:24.865
Wozniak didn't do this alone.

42:24.867 --> 42:27.935
Something or someone
gave him good reason.

42:27.937 --> 42:30.896
That's the threat you need to eliminate.
