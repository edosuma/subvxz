01:51.667 --> 01:54.000
[GOKU] Weeeee! Ho ho ho!

01:54.084 --> 01:56.042
Woah, ha ha ha!

01:59.292 --> 02:00.250
[BULMA] Hm?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.792
Waaah!

02:03.250 --> 02:05.209
[BULMA] Goku, wait for me!

02:07.042 --> 02:09.792
[NARRATOR] Goku and Bulma have
already collected four of the

02:09.875 --> 02:11.667
seven magic Dragon Balls.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.250
Now, with only three
more to find before

02:14.334 --> 02:16.709
they can make their wish,
our heroes race towards

02:16.792 --> 02:19.167
the location of the fifth
Dragon Ball, which, according

02:19.250 --> 02:21.125
to Bulma's radar, isn't far off.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.959
[engine roaring]

02:23.042 --> 02:25.459
[GOKU] Whoo, hooo! Ha ha ha!

02:25.542 --> 02:27.667
Hey, Squirt! Pay
attention to where you're going!

02:27.750 --> 02:29.542
You're not invincible, you know!

02:30.125 --> 02:38.084
[BULMA screaming]

02:38.584 --> 02:40.542
[crash]

02:43.417 --> 02:45.834
[GOKU] Wow! Are you okay, Bulma?

02:45.917 --> 02:49.459
Ugh. Does it look
like I'm okay, you twerp?

02:49.542 --> 02:51.875
[whimpering]

02:51.959 --> 02:53.750
[GOKU] I guess not.

02:57.292 --> 02:59.250
Bulma, look, the
Dragon Ball is glowing! 

03:01.125 --> 03:02.792
You know what this
means, don't you?

03:02.875 --> 03:06.125
The fifth ball must be
really close. This is great!

03:06.209 --> 03:08.834
Hey, look over there!
Do you see what I see?

03:08.917 --> 03:10.750
[BULMA] A village!
Good eye, kid.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.625
Do you think it's there?

03:12.709 --> 03:14.667
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

03:15.042 --> 03:17.000
[engine whirring]

03:27.334 --> 03:29.792
[BULMA] I wonder
where everybody is.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.667
[GOKU] Huh?

03:32.584 --> 03:34.417
[BULMA] Let's see
what the radar says.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.125
Yep, the fifth
Dragon Ball's here alright.

03:37.209 --> 03:38.667
Something's weird.

03:38.750 --> 03:39.792
[BULMA] It's too quiet.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.709
Maybe this village
has been deserted.

03:41.792 --> 03:44.500
[GOKU] No, people are
here. I can feel it.

03:44.584 --> 03:45.792
[BULMA] Are you sure, Goku?

03:45.875 --> 03:47.959
It seems like an
old ghost town to me.

03:48.042 --> 03:50.042
Yeah, I'm positive.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.000
[BULMA] If you say so.

03:52.084 --> 03:54.792
[GOKU] Hello, in
there! Come on out!

03:54.875 --> 03:57.667
[BULMA] Hello? Is
anybody home? Hello?

03:58.875 --> 04:00.584
[GOKU] I think I just saw
someone peeking at us

04:00.667 --> 04:02.834
from that window over there.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.709
[BULMA] This is getting freaky.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.792
There must be some reason
why they won't come out here,

04:07.875 --> 04:09.250
and I'm gonna find out!

04:13.667 --> 04:17.834
[GOKU] Hello? I know
you're in there. Hello?

04:17.916 --> 04:19.834
I hope they're not
in some sort of trouble.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.000
[GOKU] Oh, yeah.
That did the trick.

04:27.084 --> 04:29.042
Ever consider
using the handle?

04:30.084 --> 04:31.917
[BULMA and GOKU] Hmm?

04:32.709 --> 04:34.500
[GOKU] Huh?

04:41.709 --> 04:45.042
Aah, oww!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

04:45.125 --> 04:46.250
[screams]

04:46.334 --> 04:49.709
Ahh. Oh, no.
It's just as I feared...

04:49.792 --> 04:51.542
Oh, I should have known...

04:51.625 --> 04:53.125
[GIRL] Huh?

04:53.209 --> 04:56.209
[GOKU] What'd you do that for?!
That didn't tickle, you know!

04:57.250 --> 04:59.125
Oh, please forgive
me, Mister Oolong!

04:59.209 --> 05:01.375
I know it was foolish of
me to try and attack you,

05:01.459 --> 05:04.084
but I'd rather die
than lose my daughter!

05:04.167 --> 05:05.750
Oh, please don't take
her! I'll do anything!

05:05.834 --> 05:07.084
--[GOKU] Huh?
--[BULMA] Oolong?

05:07.167 --> 05:09.042
Hey, I think you've got
me mixed up with someone.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.000
[GOKU] My name's Goku.

05:10.084 --> 05:11.875
[GIRL] It's not him, Dad.

05:12.500 --> 05:19.542
[crowd murmuring]

05:21.084 --> 05:22.500
[GIRL] Here we
go, this'll help.

05:22.584 --> 05:23.834
[GOKU] Careful! Ow!

05:23.917 --> 05:25.084
What a thick head!

05:25.167 --> 05:26.292
Yeah, ha ha!

05:26.375 --> 05:28.667
He could've been killed!
Shame on you! Hmph!

05:28.750 --> 05:30.042
I thought he was Oolong!

05:30.125 --> 05:32.500
[MAN] I was only trying
to protect my daughter.

05:32.584 --> 05:34.500
[GOKU] Daughter? Does that
mean that you're a girl?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.084
[giggles]

05:36.167 --> 05:37.792
[screaming]

05:37.875 --> 05:41.042
Yep! Thought so!
You're a girl alright.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.042
[GOKU laughing]

05:44.084 --> 05:45.709
What'd you do that for?!

05:45.792 --> 05:47.167
Guess, Einstein!

05:47.250 --> 05:48.167
[GOKU] Hm?

05:48.250 --> 05:49.667
So what does this
Oolong fellow do

05:49.750 --> 05:52.250
that makes everybody
so afraid of him?

05:52.334 --> 05:54.709
[GIRL crying]

05:54.792 --> 05:56.459
He's our worst nightmare.

05:56.542 --> 05:58.959
He's a blackness that has
descended on our village.

05:59.042 --> 06:01.709
A monster who treats
us like his toys.

06:01.792 --> 06:02.834
That bad?

06:02.917 --> 06:04.000
[MAN] Much worse.

06:04.084 --> 06:05.375
How so?

06:05.459 --> 06:07.709
Well, somehow this terrible
creature has the power

06:07.792 --> 06:10.834
to change into any
shape it wants to.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.417
[growling]

06:12.500 --> 06:15.834
[screaming]

06:15.917 --> 06:17.709
[GOBLIN chuckles]

06:19.084 --> 06:22.125
Instead of one nightmare,
we're cursed by many.

06:22.209 --> 06:24.709
No one knows his real
identity, we just know

06:24.792 --> 06:26.292
[MAN] he wants our daughters.

06:26.375 --> 06:29.459
That monster's kidnapped three
girls from the village already.

06:29.542 --> 06:30.709
[BULMA] Huh?

06:30.792 --> 06:33.292
[MAN] And yesterday my
darkest fears came true.

06:33.375 --> 06:36.375
He wants my daughter, Pocowatha.

06:36.459 --> 06:38.459
Today's your lucky day,
Sherman Priest!

06:38.542 --> 06:40.209
I've decided to
honor your house by taking

06:40.292 --> 06:42.459
your daughter's hand
in marriage tomorrow!

06:42.542 --> 06:44.542
[POCOWATHA crying]

06:44.625 --> 06:45.917
[GOBLIN] Pack your
bag, Pocowatha!

06:46.000 --> 06:47.834
And don't worry
about the dowry, Dad!

06:47.917 --> 06:51.334
[GOBLIN laughing]

06:51.417 --> 06:52.542
Bully! Maybe we can

06:52.625 --> 06:54.500
trap him when
he comes back again.

06:54.584 --> 06:57.042
How will you do that?
He's bigger than this house!

06:57.125 --> 06:59.209
My word. You don't
get it, do you?

06:59.292 --> 07:01.417
Oolong would squish
you like a little bug!

07:01.500 --> 07:03.584
There's no way to
stop this monster!

07:03.667 --> 07:05.084
[whimpering]

07:05.167 --> 07:07.250
[SHERMAN] So tell us: why have
you two come here anyway?

07:07.334 --> 07:08.250
I'll show you.

07:08.334 --> 07:09.709
[SHERMAN] Hmm?

07:10.834 --> 07:13.917
[BULMA] Let's see...
there it is!

07:14.000 --> 07:16.834
We came to find a ball
that matches this one.

07:16.917 --> 07:21.375
Hm. Strange.
Yes, it's very beautiful.

07:21.459 --> 07:23.000
But I've never seen
anything like it.

07:23.084 --> 07:25.834
--[OLD WOMAN] Well, I have.
--[SHERMAN] Huh?

07:25.917 --> 07:28.209
Young lady, I have
the matching one.

07:28.292 --> 07:29.917
I knew there was one here!

07:30.000 --> 07:31.709
What do you know?
How 'bout that.

07:31.792 --> 07:33.292
[BULMA] Can I see it, please?

07:33.375 --> 07:35.584
[OLD WOMAN] Mm-hmm.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.125
Here it is.

07:37.209 --> 07:39.459
Yeah! The six-star ball!

07:39.542 --> 07:40.459
[GOKU] Wow.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.209
--Cool!
--Would you give it to us?

07:42.292 --> 07:44.000
I'm not going to
give this ball away.

07:44.084 --> 07:46.875
It's been in my
family for generations.

07:48.209 --> 07:50.417
[BULMA] Would you give us
your Dragon Ball if we could

07:50.500 --> 07:53.042
get rid of that Oolong creep,
get the girls back,

07:53.125 --> 07:55.709
and return your village
to a peaceful place again?

07:55.792 --> 07:59.167
[SHERMAN] A-Ah, by yourselves?

07:59.250 --> 08:02.500
Now, listen, I may be old
but I'm not gullible.

08:02.584 --> 08:05.375
How could the two
of you defeat Oolong?

08:05.459 --> 08:07.792
Well, Goku and I
are quite a team, ma'am.

08:07.875 --> 08:08.834
Right? Huh?

08:08.917 --> 08:10.834
[crowd murmuring]

08:10.917 --> 08:12.417
[BULMA yells]

08:13.125 --> 08:14.834
So you're a girl,
aren't you?

08:14.917 --> 08:17.125
Huh?! What a randy boy!

08:18.042 --> 08:20.875
Are you crazy?!
Please stop doing that!

08:20.959 --> 08:22.459
[BULMA] Ugh!

08:22.542 --> 08:24.834
[MAN] Do you think that you and
that boy really have a chance

08:24.917 --> 08:26.709
to beat Oolong, Miss?

08:27.250 --> 08:29.000
[BULMA] Yeah, I think we
have a good chance.

08:29.084 --> 08:31.250
Goku's a little on the puny
side, but he packs a wallop.

08:31.334 --> 08:32.542
Don'tcha kid?

08:32.625 --> 08:33.875
[GOKU] Hmm.

08:33.958 --> 08:36.458
[BULMA] I'm Bulma. I'm
the brains of the outfit.

08:36.542 --> 08:38.042
Would you forgive me
for hitting you?

08:38.125 --> 08:39.250
We'd appreciate your help.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.333
[GOKU] Sure.

08:40.417 --> 08:41.958
There's a legend
that speaks of a boy who

08:42.042 --> 08:43.542
would come to
liberate our people,

08:43.625 --> 08:46.042
but we always thought
it was just folklore.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.292
[OLD WOMAN] Mm-hmm.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.584
Bulma, it would be the
answer to all my prayers

08:49.667 --> 08:51.834
if you brought my baby back!

08:52.625 --> 08:54.334
[MAN 2] You have my
blessing young warrior.

08:54.417 --> 08:57.167
Your courage stands like a
great monument before my people.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.459
[giggles]

08:58.542 --> 09:00.500
I just thought of a
great way to trap Oolong.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.750
[BULMA] All right!
You look great, kid!

09:03.834 --> 09:06.584
You'd be totally charming
if you smiled a bit more.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.542
There's not much
to smile about.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.584
Can we come up with
a different plan, Bulma?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.667
Sorry, no time, kid!

09:12.750 --> 09:15.292
Gosh, Goku.
You make a real pretty girl.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.875
[BULMA] Now remember Goku,
don't blow your cover.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.917
He has to think
you're Pocowatha.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.292
The important thing is
to find out where

09:21.375 --> 09:23.834
he's keeping the girls.
After that you can handle it

09:23.917 --> 09:25.334
any way you want to.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.167
All right, all right.
I'll do it.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.334
But I'm not going to
like this one little bit!

09:29.417 --> 09:31.000
[distant crash]

09:31.084 --> 09:32.042
Huh?

09:32.125 --> 09:33.750
[SHERMAN] It's Oolong!
He's coming!

09:33.834 --> 09:35.500
[BULMA screaming]

09:35.584 --> 09:44.584
[OOLONG growling]

09:44.667 --> 09:50.125
[VILLAGERS screaming]

09:50.209 --> 09:51.459
[MAN] He's coming!

09:51.542 --> 09:54.125
Oolong's in the village
and he's on his way here!

09:54.209 --> 09:56.334
[BULMA] Good job! Now try
to make sure everyone

09:56.417 --> 09:57.750
gets into their
houses safely!

09:57.834 --> 09:58.792
[MAN] I'll do it!

09:59.625 --> 10:01.834
Okay, it's up to you.
Good luck.

10:01.917 --> 10:04.167
Well, since you're
the brains of this outfit,

10:04.250 --> 10:06.042
you're going to help me, right?

10:09.542 --> 10:11.209
[BULMA] I'll be right here
rooting for you, Goku.

10:11.292 --> 10:12.500
[GOKU] Mmm.

10:12.584 --> 10:14.417
[BULMA] Alright, kid,
it's showtime.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.250
Don't let him get a
good look at your face.

10:16.334 --> 10:18.209
And remember: smile.

10:18.292 --> 10:20.084
[GOKU] Next time, I'm
making the plan.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.084
[OOLONG] I've come for
you, my little buttercup!

10:26.167 --> 10:28.167
I brought you some flowers.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.709
I hope you
like them, sweetheart.

10:30.792 --> 10:33.084
[GOKU] Oh, y-yeah, uh,
I love flowers.

10:33.167 --> 10:37.000
[OOLONG] Huh? Packed
your rolling pin?

10:37.084 --> 10:38.375
[whimpering]

10:38.459 --> 10:40.459
[OOLONG] And I see you've
put on a little weight!

10:40.542 --> 10:43.125
[GOKU] Yeah, well, uh,
l-look who's talking.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.375
You scamp!

10:44.459 --> 10:47.000
[OOLONG] A little feisty
today, aren't we?

10:47.084 --> 10:49.042
Goku! Where did you
learn how to act?!

10:49.125 --> 10:50.167
If you don't shape up,
you're gonna

10:50.250 --> 10:52.042
blow this thing big-time!

10:52.125 --> 10:53.584
Mmm.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.834
That's good,
I like 'em fiesty.

10:55.917 --> 10:57.417
I wouldn't change
anything on you,

10:57.500 --> 11:00.250
except maybe that ugly scarf.

11:00.334 --> 11:02.209
[GOKU] Hm? Uh-oh...

11:02.292 --> 11:04.625
Oh my. You're trembling.

11:04.709 --> 11:07.417
[GOKU] That's because I need
to use the bathroom real bad.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.917
You're scared!

11:09.000 --> 11:11.417
Well, I get my feelings hurt
when girls are scared of me.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.709
[OOLONG] No more! That's it!

11:12.792 --> 11:15.209
[growls]

11:15.292 --> 11:19.250
[whimpering]

11:33.667 --> 11:35.167
[GOKU] Huh?

11:35.250 --> 11:36.459
What do you think of this?

11:36.542 --> 11:38.875
Suave, debonair, handsome.
If you don't like it

11:38.959 --> 11:41.417
I can always change
into something else.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.917
[GOKU chuckles]

11:43.000 --> 11:44.334
[BULMA] Aah!

11:44.417 --> 11:46.709
--[OOLONG] Hmm?
--[GOKU] Huh?

11:49.125 --> 11:52.084
Well, hello there, stranger!
My name's Bulma.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.125
I don't think we've met.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.542
[GOKU] Aah!

11:55.625 --> 11:57.375
My. Can such beauty be real?

11:57.459 --> 11:59.375
You must be a dream.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.750
Nope, I'm all... woman.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.625
[OOLONG] Imagine, if I had
a woman like that...

12:05.709 --> 12:08.667
Oohhh...

12:08.750 --> 12:12.625
Yes. She's a delicious
catch if I ever saw one.

12:12.709 --> 12:15.417
Oh, but what about Pocowatha?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.709
So, uh, when are
you gonna kidnap me

12:16.792 --> 12:18.375
and take me away?

12:18.459 --> 12:20.417
[OOLONG] Ooh, I can't
just leave Pocowatha,

12:20.500 --> 12:22.875
but I'd be crazy to
refuse a girl like that.

12:24.792 --> 12:28.500
Pocowatha or the new girl?
Pocowatha or the new girl?

12:28.584 --> 12:30.542
Pocowatha or the--huh?

12:32.084 --> 12:33.042
Where'd she go?

12:36.750 --> 12:41.209
[OOLONG] What?! Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?!

12:41.292 --> 12:44.834
This must be some
mistake! It can't be!

12:44.917 --> 12:46.917
Hmm? Uurgh!

12:47.000 --> 12:54.667
[screaming]

12:54.750 --> 12:57.667
I've been deceived!
You're not Pocowatha!

12:57.750 --> 13:00.584
Huh? What gave me away?
It was my tail, wasn't it?

13:00.667 --> 13:03.750
If there is one thing
I cannot tolerate,

13:03.834 --> 13:06.959
it is deception!

13:07.042 --> 13:08.334
[grunts]

13:09.209 --> 13:10.584
[GOKU] Huh?

13:12.209 --> 13:16.750
[OOLONG laughing]

13:16.834 --> 13:18.417
[GOKU] Man, that's one big cow!

13:18.500 --> 13:20.625
I'm am not a cow,
I am a bull!

13:20.709 --> 13:22.084
Can't you tell the difference?!

13:22.167 --> 13:23.875
And I'm a pretty mean one, too!

13:23.959 --> 13:25.209
Huh? Whoa!

13:25.292 --> 13:27.125
What happened to my polite,
handsome, debonair man

13:27.209 --> 13:29.000
with the really
expensive trench coat?

13:30.209 --> 13:31.167
Excuse me.

13:31.792 --> 13:33.625
This is just too weird!

13:35.459 --> 13:37.959
That monstrous beast
has deceived you, too.

13:38.042 --> 13:40.084
He fools you by changing
into the one thing

13:40.167 --> 13:42.584
that you want most. And in
your case, that's a man.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.875
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

13:44.959 --> 13:46.209
Uh...

13:46.292 --> 13:48.292
The good thing is I don't
think he wants to marry

13:48.375 --> 13:51.500
Pocowatha any more, he
wants to marry you instead.

13:51.584 --> 13:53.584
You'll make a
nice bride, Bulma.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.625
What kind of a girl
do you think I am?!

13:55.709 --> 13:57.250
I'm not getting
married to a bull!

13:57.334 --> 13:58.792
And that's that!

13:58.875 --> 14:03.584
[OOLONG chuckles intensely]

14:03.667 --> 14:05.375
Goku, the plan's off, kiddo!

14:05.459 --> 14:07.667
It's time to take
the bull by the horns!

14:07.750 --> 14:09.292
[GOKU yelling]

14:09.375 --> 14:10.709
Ha!

14:10.792 --> 14:13.459
Now we'll see just
how tough you really are.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.542
Don't forget to find out
where the girls are!

14:15.625 --> 14:17.209
And stay alive, okay?!

14:17.292 --> 14:20.209
Say your prayers, chico,
your time has come!

14:20.292 --> 14:21.917
[OOLONG laughing]

14:22.000 --> 14:24.500
You've reached the end of
the road there, muchacho!

14:24.584 --> 14:25.917
[laughing]

14:26.000 --> 14:27.875
Eh. Smile. Pfft.

14:27.959 --> 14:28.709
[OOLONG yells]

14:28.792 --> 14:30.084
What are you, loco, kid?!

14:30.167 --> 14:33.042
There's still a way
you can save yourself!

14:33.125 --> 14:34.084
Get the seÃ±orita!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.959
Forget it, bully!
Come on, let's go!

14:39.042 --> 14:40.459
[OOLONG] Alright, then!
So be it!

14:40.542 --> 14:44.250
A little monkey-boy burrito
might hit the spot anyway!

14:44.334 --> 14:45.625
Sounds yummy!

14:45.709 --> 14:47.709
Look, you can't scare me
like you've scared

14:47.792 --> 14:49.500
everyone else.
I'm not buying it!

14:49.584 --> 14:50.667
[OOLONG] Haven't you noticed?!

14:50.750 --> 14:53.459
You're a little
cucaracha with a stick,

14:53.542 --> 14:56.084
and I am a gigantic bull!

14:56.167 --> 14:59.084
I don't care what you are,
give those girls back now!

14:59.167 --> 15:00.500
[grunts]

15:01.209 --> 15:02.750
[clock chiming]

15:02.834 --> 15:04.209
Uh...I will be back!

15:05.542 --> 15:06.500
[GOKU] Huh?

15:08.334 --> 15:10.625
[GOKU] Hey! Come back
here and fight!

15:10.709 --> 15:12.084
Where are you going?!

15:14.834 --> 15:17.042
[GOKU] Hey, come back!

15:26.042 --> 15:27.250
[GOKU] Huh?

15:27.334 --> 15:30.500
[whistling]

15:30.584 --> 15:31.917
Hey, excuse me.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.125
A giant bull just came
barreling through here.

15:34.209 --> 15:35.959
Did you see where it went?

15:36.042 --> 15:37.209
There.

15:37.292 --> 15:38.292
[GOKU] Ha-ha!

15:39.834 --> 15:43.292
Hi. This is the bonafide one
hundred percent original me.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.542
Believe it or not,
a good-looking guy like myself

15:45.625 --> 15:47.250
has trouble scoring chicks.

15:47.334 --> 15:49.042
That's why I transform.

15:51.959 --> 15:53.917
[OOLONG] The art of
transformation is a very

15:54.000 --> 15:56.709
powerful technique and should
only be used responsibly

15:56.792 --> 15:58.542
to solve serious problems.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.667
In my case, I was being
dogged by girls left and right,

16:01.750 --> 16:04.417
despite my natural cute
and cuddly appearance.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.167
But now that I've gone to
shape-shifting school,

16:06.250 --> 16:07.750
all that's changed.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.459
But the problem is I can only
hold a shape for five minutes,

16:10.542 --> 16:11.667
and then, poof!

16:11.750 --> 16:13.375
That's why I had to
run away from that kid.

16:13.459 --> 16:14.709
[SHERMAN]
You say Oolong ran away?

16:14.792 --> 16:15.875
[BULMA]
Yeah, I saw him take off,

16:15.959 --> 16:18.000
and Goku went after him.

16:18.084 --> 16:20.334
[SHERMAN] Hmm. Remarkable.

16:20.417 --> 16:22.750
What an extraordinary boy.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.500
Yeah. Goku will
chase him a hundred miles

16:24.584 --> 16:25.917
if he has to.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.917
Wow. Maybe it's
the legend after all.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.417
Hey, yo, Oolong.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.167
I know you're out there,
you can't hide forever.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.375
Couldn't find him, huh?

16:34.459 --> 16:36.125
[GOKU] Uh-uh.

16:36.209 --> 16:38.875
[chuckles]

16:38.959 --> 16:41.167
[GOKU] Hey, everybody,
he ran away!

16:41.250 --> 16:44.625
He might just be hiding
though, so look out!

16:44.709 --> 16:46.375
[OOLONG] All right,
here we go again.

16:46.459 --> 16:48.834
But I'd better watch it, or this
kid could ruin a good thing.

16:48.917 --> 16:50.792
If I wanna keep these
simpletons in line,

16:50.875 --> 16:54.584
I'd better come up with
something really fierce.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.459
Wait, I know
a good one... Yeah.

16:59.417 --> 17:02.125
[GOKU] Hmm. I guess he is gone.

17:02.209 --> 17:04.875
[yells]

17:06.166 --> 17:07.375
Uh...!

17:07.459 --> 17:08.541
[OOLONG]
Looking for me, kid?

17:08.625 --> 17:09.791
[laughs]

17:09.875 --> 17:12.291
Did you really think
I would run away?!

17:12.375 --> 17:14.000
[GOKU stammers]

17:15.666 --> 17:17.916
[OOLONG] You seem a
little timid this time.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.250
Well you're lucky, tiny tot,
because I'm feeling generous.

17:21.334 --> 17:23.459
I was going to dunk you
in this hot soup

17:23.541 --> 17:25.209
and eat you like a dumpling,

17:25.291 --> 17:28.459
but if you leave town now,
I will spare you.

17:28.541 --> 17:31.209
I think I'll stay.
So go ahead and eat me...

17:31.292 --> 17:32.500
if you can!

17:32.584 --> 17:34.875
[OOLONG] If I can?!
How dare you--

17:34.959 --> 17:36.917
[crying]

17:37.459 --> 17:39.459
[OOLONG] Look what
you made me do!

17:39.542 --> 17:40.500
[GOKU] What are you
talking about?

17:40.584 --> 17:42.375
I didn't make you do anything!

17:42.459 --> 17:43.709
[OOLONG]
Alright, that does it!

17:43.792 --> 17:45.292
Your luck's run out,
little runt!

17:45.375 --> 17:46.834
I was going to
let you go because

17:46.917 --> 17:48.542
you're not like all
the other cowards,

17:48.625 --> 17:51.459
but now I have no
choice but to destroy--

17:51.542 --> 17:56.125
[wailing]

17:56.209 --> 17:59.292
[WOMAN] Johnny, do you
wanna get yourself killed?!

17:59.375 --> 18:01.417
Ah! You know you've
got a real little monster

18:01.500 --> 18:04.042
on your hands there, lady!

18:04.125 --> 18:06.042
[OOLONG] Kids these days...

18:06.125 --> 18:07.625
Now, where were we?

18:07.709 --> 18:09.959
[GOKU] You were just saying that
you were going to destroy me.

18:10.042 --> 18:12.334
[OOLONG] Oh, yeah,
yeah, right! Thanks, kid!

18:12.417 --> 18:13.667
You know what though?

18:13.750 --> 18:15.292
I don't think you're as
strong as you say you are.

18:15.375 --> 18:16.667
[OOLONG] Rrrrgh!
Listen here:

18:16.750 --> 18:19.000
I'm the fiercest,
most impolite warrior

18:19.084 --> 18:20.584
on the face of the Earth!

18:20.667 --> 18:22.334
[GOKU] Yeah? I doubt it.

18:22.417 --> 18:23.834
[OOLONG] What makes
you think that you're

18:23.917 --> 18:25.625
any match for me?!

18:25.709 --> 18:28.959
I learned karate
from my Grandpa.

18:29.042 --> 18:31.542
[OOLONG] Karate, huh?! Well,
if you're any good at karate,

18:31.625 --> 18:34.417
you could break these
bricks with one hand!

18:35.542 --> 18:37.042
[GOKU] Oh yeah?
Well, I can break them apart

18:37.125 --> 18:39.084
with one finger! Watch this!

18:42.167 --> 18:42.750
[OOLONG] Huh?!

18:42.834 --> 18:43.917
[GOKU laughing]

18:44.000 --> 18:45.167
[OOLONG] Do you know
what I do to people

18:45.250 --> 18:46.625
who can do that?!

18:48.334 --> 18:50.459
[shrill laughter]

18:50.542 --> 18:52.709
[OOLONG]
Nothing! Later, sucker!

18:52.792 --> 18:54.209
Hey, where're ya going?!

18:54.292 --> 18:56.667
Hey, don't just stand there!
Go after him, kid!

18:56.750 --> 18:59.625
If he gets away, we'll never
find out where the girls are!

18:59.709 --> 19:02.292
Oh, you're right.
Hmm. Nimbus!

19:07.542 --> 19:08.500
Good luck!

19:08.584 --> 19:09.834
Amazing!

19:09.917 --> 19:11.500
It's our legend that an
evil monster would be--

19:11.584 --> 19:13.500
toppled over
by a mere boy

19:13.584 --> 19:15.542
who could dance
on the clouds.

19:19.209 --> 19:21.292
That kid was a
royal pain in the kiester!

19:21.375 --> 19:22.625
Too bad he doesn't
know how to fly!

19:22.709 --> 19:24.875
[chuckles]

19:24.959 --> 19:25.792
[GOKU] Hey, Oolong!

19:25.875 --> 19:27.292
[screams]

19:27.375 --> 19:29.334
Where do you think
you're going?!

19:32.584 --> 19:33.917
[OOLONG] So long, sucker!

19:34.000 --> 19:35.375
[GOKU] Oh, no you don't!

19:41.959 --> 19:43.334
[panting]

19:45.000 --> 19:46.375
[GOKU] Here I come!

19:53.625 --> 19:56.000
[GOKU] I'm gaining
on you, Oolong!

20:03.292 --> 20:05.667
[GOKU] I won't let you
get away, you know.

20:07.334 --> 20:09.167
[OOLONG] Oh no!
My five minutes...

20:09.250 --> 20:10.250
are up!

20:10.334 --> 20:12.459
[yells]

20:13.334 --> 20:20.042
[OOLONG yelling]

20:20.125 --> 20:22.084
[OOLONG] I'm not ready to die!

20:22.417 --> 20:24.292
That's because you
haven't been being good.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.750
And who the heck
are you? My psychiatrist?!

20:27.625 --> 20:28.792
Well, now, porky,

20:28.875 --> 20:30.584
what do you have to
say for yourself?

20:30.667 --> 20:32.667
An apology
would be nice.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.417
All right, then! I'm sorry.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
I can't believe I's
scared of that pig...

20:36.584 --> 20:38.000
Now where's my grandaughter

20:38.084 --> 20:39.417
and the rest of the girls?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.542
They're... home.

20:41.625 --> 20:42.375
What home?!

20:42.459 --> 20:43.792
Look, pal.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.750
Your reign of terror is over,
capiche?! Now tell us!

20:46.834 --> 20:50.417
Bulma, you're really brave
now that Oolong's tied up.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.917
â™ª Doot doo-doo... â™ª

20:52.000 --> 21:02.750
â™ª

21:02.834 --> 21:05.000
Hey! If you're planning on
turning into a bug,

21:05.084 --> 21:07.125
forget it! I'll squash ya!

21:07.209 --> 21:08.625
[OOLONG groans]

21:10.292 --> 21:12.375
Where exactly is
this shack of yours?

21:12.459 --> 21:13.834
Is it far?

21:14.667 --> 21:16.042
Here's my little shack.

21:16.125 --> 21:21.334
[gong crash]

21:21.417 --> 21:22.667
Awesome!

21:22.750 --> 21:24.792
You don't see houses like
that every day, do you?

21:24.875 --> 21:26.375
What a palace!

21:26.459 --> 21:28.334
[GOKU] How'd you get
such a big place?

21:28.417 --> 21:29.750
Well, it wasn't easy, kiddo.

21:29.834 --> 21:32.125
I had to rip off
a lot of people.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.250
And you're proud of that?

21:33.334 --> 21:35.042
[MAN] Little Flower, it's me!

21:35.125 --> 21:36.542
Your Poo-Paw is here!

21:36.625 --> 21:37.542
[MAN 2] Alexi!

21:37.625 --> 21:38.584
[WOMAN] Mother's here, Sarah!

21:38.667 --> 21:39.875
[MAN] You're safe now,
sweetheart!

21:39.959 --> 21:42.209
Don't worry, girls!
We're coming!

21:44.584 --> 21:46.167
[WOMAN] Huh?! Sarah!
Is that you?!

21:46.250 --> 21:48.500
[MAN 2] Alexi!
What are you doing?!

21:48.584 --> 21:52.417
Oh, hi, Daddy.
What's happening?

21:52.500 --> 21:55.042
Sorry, I didn't write, Mommy.
I've been super busy.

21:55.125 --> 21:58.084
Me, too. Man, time has
just been flying by.

21:58.167 --> 21:59.542
[BULMA] Did you find them?

21:59.625 --> 22:01.000
--[GOKU] Huh?
--[OOLONG] Hi, girls.

22:01.084 --> 22:03.167
[ALEXI] Oh, hi snookums!
Oh, before I forget,

22:03.250 --> 22:05.875
I'm totally out of pink
lipstick and red nail polish.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.542
[SARAH] And I need
a new hair-dryer.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.959
[LITTLE FLOWER] Did you bring
the diet drinks I asked you for?

22:10.042 --> 22:11.542
I was hoping
these girls would cook

22:11.625 --> 22:13.209
and take care of my house,
but they won't.

22:13.292 --> 22:15.084
All they wanna do
is lay around.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.167
Take them off my hands.
Pretty please?

22:17.250 --> 22:20.209
[gasping]

22:21.125 --> 22:23.250
Well, this belongs
to you and Goku now.

22:23.334 --> 22:25.292
Wow, you made our day!

22:27.250 --> 22:30.292
[BULMA] Just two more to go and
then I can call the Dragon

22:30.375 --> 22:32.167
to make my wish!
