WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:07.365
Well, Whitney,
you shipped out over there.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.634
I'm sure it's pretty warm.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.300
That really sucked.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.039
It's okay, Clark, just say what you feel.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.043
What's with Clark Kent,
movie star?

00:16.216 --> 00:18.481
Lana's making a video-letter
for Whitney overseas.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.883
Thought it was the least I could do.
Hey, do you wanna give it a shot?

00:22.089 --> 00:23.886
Watch how the pros do it.

00:24.358 --> 00:28.124
The town's still rebuilding after the storm.
The first week of school's a bear.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.525
You're missing the worst heat wave
in 25 years.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.098
Bottom line, stay safe and come home soon.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.703
P.S. The football team's toast
without Fordman on offense.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.838
- That was perfect, Pete.
- Yeah, super.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.965
Try not to choke this time.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.975
How about it, Clark?
Wanna try take two?

00:46.147 --> 00:47.409
How about a rain check?

00:47.581 --> 00:50.175
Sure. Why don't you come by
the Talon later.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.785
- All right.
- All right, see you.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.387
- It's good to see some things never change.
- Chloe.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.651
- Hi.
- Hey, you're back.

01:02.663 --> 01:06.861
Yeah. Fresh from the wilds of Metropolis
and the Daily Planet internship program.

01:07.034 --> 01:10.003
Pete said you were a big hit.
I thought we had lost you for good.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.662
Well, my dad decided to give
LexCorp another shot...

01:12.840 --> 01:14.535
...so here I am,
back in the boonies.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.734
I'm glad you're staying.
I really missed you this summer.

01:17.912 --> 01:21.177
Yeah, I could tell by
the voluminous e-mails you sent.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.248
Yeah, sorry. With the farm and...

01:23.417 --> 01:25.647
Don't worry about it, Clark.
It's not a big deal.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.912
Well, I'm really excited to hear
your stories.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.481
Yeah, actually, you know what?
There aren't any stories.

01:31.659 --> 01:35.527
Oh, except that I did meet this really hot
young intern from Metropolis High.

01:35.763 --> 01:40.063
It was great. He made me forget all about
Smallville for three whole months.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.137
- Oh, great.
- What?

01:51.312 --> 01:53.746
Every year,
the incredibly aged Mrs. Kowalski...

01:53.914 --> 01:56.576
...kicks off biology class
with an ancient sex-ed film.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.581
Who told you that, your brother?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.185
My dad.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.883
Well, I'm sure it can't be that bad.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.882
Good morning, I'm Ms. Atkins.

02:06.327 --> 02:10.787
I'll be your new biology teacher
on health and human development.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.266
I'm really sorry about
the air conditioning in here.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.640
Let's get ready for a movie.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.778
All right.
Everybody try to stay awake.

02:28.115 --> 02:32.552
All members of the animal kingdom,
from the simplest one-celled organism...

02:32.720 --> 02:37.157
...to the most complex of mammals,
engage in reproduction.

02:38.158 --> 02:42.720
This ensures that each individual creature
can pass on its genetic information...

02:42.896 --> 02:44.921
...to future generations.

02:45.566 --> 02:49.093
Animals rely on a variety
of courtship methods.

02:49.737 --> 02:56.074
This remarkable reproductive process
is set into motion by the act of copulation...

02:56.543 --> 03:00.138
...also known as "intercourse" or "coitus."

03:00.314 --> 03:03.408
In many species,
the females attract their mates...

03:03.584 --> 03:06.883
...with chemical scents called pheromones.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.082
Pheromones are used to elicit
specific behaviors...

03:11.258 --> 03:15.752
...from members of the opposite sex
and are secreted by glands...

03:15.929 --> 03:20.298
...or incorporated into other fluids,
such as perspiration.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.796
The desired goal of all courtship behavior
in mammals is...

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074

03:36.984 --> 03:40.147
Okay, everybody, walk, do not run.
Leave your books.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.948
Let's go!

04:50.023 --> 04:51.581
Lex.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.822
I came as soon as I heard.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.896
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.589
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.768
Thanks to this young man right here.
Clark, come here for a second.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.068
He was the only one that
kept a cool head during the entire thing.

05:07.241 --> 05:09.141
He actually put the fire out.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.173
Why am I not surprised?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.407
Clark, once again, I'm grateful.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.346
And I'm confused.

05:17.184 --> 05:20.813
You're right, and I'm sorry.
I'd like you to meet Desiree Atkins.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.785
My fiancee.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.625
All clear, safe to go back into the building.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.156
See you in class, Clark.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.623
Fiancee, huh?

05:34.368 --> 05:37.269
I didn't even know you were seeing anyone.
You sure about this?

05:37.438 --> 05:39.998
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

05:41.408 --> 05:45.139
I was gonna have this messengered,
but since you're here...

05:50.918 --> 05:53.113
It's a wedding invitation for tonight.

05:53.287 --> 05:56.586
I know it's short notice,
but I was hoping you'd be my best man.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.986
- Lex, I don't know what to say.
- I hope you'll say yes.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.760
Well, I'm surprised.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.558
And honored.

06:08.735 --> 06:09.997
Good.

06:10.671 --> 06:14.903
Better get back to class. You never know
when the next fire may erupt.

06:26.153 --> 06:30.351
Oh, a wedding present from your father.
So do you want me to sign this?

06:30.991 --> 06:34.586
Well, if you don't,
my father could disinherit me.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.059
Fine. I'll sign it.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.929
But it's gonna cost you a kiss.

07:00.654 --> 07:04.215
I really wish we didn't have to sign this
on our wedding day.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.689
You're right.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.094
You're the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.791
I plan on being with you
until death do us part.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.934
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.804
Tell me again your aversion
to air conditioning.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.278
Two words:

07:29.583 --> 07:31.141
Electric bill.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.218
Hi, Clark. How was school?

07:36.590 --> 07:37.852
It was different.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.695
- Do we like different?
- There was a fire during biology class.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.261
It's okay. Nobody was hurt.
I stopped it before it spread.

07:47.668 --> 07:51.160
- It sounds like we should be proud of you.
- Except I think I started it.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.366
Wait, you want to explain that, please?

07:55.008 --> 07:58.034
I started to feel hot.
My eyes started to burn.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.203
All of the sudden,
the spot I was staring at burst into flames.

08:01.381 --> 08:02.848
Just by looking at it?

08:03.150 --> 08:07.519
Hello. Hi, I'm Clark. I'm the kid who can
lift up tractors and see through walls.

08:07.688 --> 08:11.180
Son, hang on just a second. What exactly
was going on when this happened?

08:11.358 --> 08:14.259
We'd just met our new biology teacher
and were watching a film.

08:14.428 --> 08:17.522
- An educational film?
- Sex-educational film.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.228
This could get very complicated.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.106
Clark, it's possible
that whatever's happened...

08:28.275 --> 08:31.073
...has some sort of hormonal connection.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.836
Yes.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.977
Great, so I'm maturing into a fire-starter?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.775
No, son, look...

08:37.951 --> 08:42.217
We've just gotta get a handle on this thing,
like we got a handle on your other abilities.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.756
Except all my other abilities
didn't involve things bursting into flames.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.360
All the more reason for you
to give it some time.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.429
- You'll just have to stay close to home.
- Great.

08:51.598 --> 08:52.860
Then we'll figure it out.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.168
I can't.

08:58.505 --> 08:59.836
Why, what's this?

09:01.308 --> 09:03.503
You're not gonna believe it.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.118
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.508
- Hey, Chloe. Been looking all over for you.
- Hey.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.476
Really? I'm not that hard to find, Clark.

09:40.647 --> 09:45.209
Only Lex Luthor could put together
a fairy-tale wedding in less than 48 hours.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.910
Look, you seemed a little distant
this morning.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.318
I want to make sure everything's
okay between us.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.151
Yeah, it's hunky-dory.

09:52.325 --> 09:56.022
Now I know something's wrong. The only
person who says "hunky-dory" is my father.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.591
Look, Clark, I guess I just let
my feelings get the better of me.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.792
But, you know, we made a decision,
and I'm perfectly fine with it.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.162
Me too.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.800
Great.

10:07.474 --> 10:11.843
But I still don't know how I feel about
taking Sex Ed from Mrs. Luthor.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.573
- I can't believe Lex is married.
- He says he really loves her.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.044
Yeah, well, love is rarely, if ever, logical.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.517
Maybe they just have the right pheromones.

10:23.090 --> 10:27.356
It's chemistry, Clark.
Some people have it, others don't.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.134
Nice smile. Great.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.669
Quit staring, Clark.
You'll burn your eyes out.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.329
- I was just...
- It's all right.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.771
Desiree's attractive, I understand.
Oh, and thanks again, Clark.

10:46.546 --> 10:49.481
Lex, I gotta tell you,
I was a bit shell-shocked.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.514
You go away on a two-week business trip.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.347
Next thing I know,
my mom's finishing your wedding cake?

10:54.521 --> 10:57.718
Believe me, when I left
I had no intention of falling in love.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.019
I was struggling through
another endless business function...

11:01.194 --> 11:03.094
...when suddenly Desiree was there.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.528
She must have made
quite a first impression.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.766
Actually, she said she'd come to save me.

11:12.806 --> 11:16.936
I thought it was a joke too, that she was
only interested in my name or fortune.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.876
But as the night wore on,
I realized she was different.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.906
It just happened that fast?

11:24.651 --> 11:29.111
You can waste your time playing it safe or
you can go for it. But at some point, Clark...

11:29.289 --> 11:31.985
...you just know when something's right.

11:43.603 --> 11:47.972
And Pete's taping all the Sharks games
for you, so you won't miss a thing...

11:48.141 --> 11:51.372
...though, the way they're playing,
you might want to.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.943
Anyway, I haven't forgotten what
we talked about, so don't worry.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.583
Just come home soon and be safe.

11:57.851 --> 12:01.082
That was great.
Thanks so much for doing this, Clark.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.484
So, what did you and Whitney
talk about, anyway?

12:03.657 --> 12:06.626
Oh, just that he wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.423
Not that he doesn't trust you...

12:13.633 --> 12:18.161
It's hot. Do you want an iced coffee?
I'm gonna go make an iced coffee.

12:19.539 --> 12:23.999
One of the perks of management,
24-hour access to the cappuccino machine.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.208
So, what did you say to Whitney?

12:29.382 --> 12:33.751
Started my message five or six times, but I
can't finish. There's so much I want to say.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.621
It's not easy being in
a long-distance relationship.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.523
I miss him.

12:42.162 --> 12:46.064
And I'm worried about him,
but it's difficult putting your life on hold.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.794
I'm not sure it was the wisest decision
for either of us.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.735
I get his e-mails.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.635
He's having a really tough time.

12:55.809 --> 12:59.336
First with basic training,
now being shipped out.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.207
He needs someone he can count on.

13:03.783 --> 13:08.015
Besides, I do have you
to look out for me, don't I?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.656
I know I haven't been around much
this summer. Thanks.

13:10.824 --> 13:13.588
But ever since the storm,
the farm has just been a disaster.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.661
Seems like we're all trying
to find our way back from that day.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.865
Except for Lex.
I've never seen him so happy before.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.830
It's kind of weird.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.095
I'm glad I'm not the only one
who thinks that.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.364
Still, you have to admit, it's romantic.

13:27.073 --> 13:30.907
- Well, Lex makes it seem easy.
- Maybe it is.

13:31.077 --> 13:35.173
Lex learned to act on his passion.
Never hold anything back.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.613
I wonder if we'll ever be able
to do the same.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.425
- Clark, what's wrong?
- Just not feeling so well.

13:57.404 --> 14:00.271
Oh, my God, you're burning up.
Let me drive you home.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.826
You okay?

14:23.997 --> 14:27.364
Yeah, I'm fine. What happened?
I'm gonna call 911.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.161
I'm not sure.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.706
Clark?

14:37.877 --> 14:40.607
- I thought you'd be in school already.
- I'm not going.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.677
It happened again at the Talon.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.375
What, another fire?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.786
It was worse than before.

14:48.955 --> 14:53.551
I was afraid it wasn't gonna stop. The fire
department said the fire looked suspicious.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.024
- Come on.
- And they're right.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.789
We both know you didn't mean
to start any of these fires.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.125
Dad, Lana was there.
If I'd have hurt her...

15:00.300 --> 15:01.858
Look, son...

15:02.836 --> 15:04.098
Clark.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.799
Hey, come on.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.737
Clark.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.604
Look at me.

15:14.781 --> 15:18.444
Son, I think I have a pretty good idea
of what's triggering this thing.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.549
All right. Rule number one:

15:25.725 --> 15:28.694
Always practice away from the barn.
Come on.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.087
I don't get it. I thought the point
was to stop this from happening.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.031
Well, in order to find the off switch,
first we need to find the on switch, right?

15:36.202 --> 15:37.533
All right.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.606
Now, I want you to remember...

15:40.774 --> 15:44.301
...exactly what you were thinking about
the first time it happened.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.414
Come on.

15:53.853 --> 15:57.345
- Dad, this might be easier if I was...
- Alone. Yeah.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.019
Sorry.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.057
Thanks.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.571
Lana.

16:42.902 --> 16:46.668
Five scarecrows, two water barrels
and our mailbox later...

16:47.240 --> 16:50.266
Dad, you were right.
Once I understood what triggered the heat...

16:50.443 --> 16:52.968
...I was able to control it
without thinking about...

16:53.146 --> 16:54.875
...sex.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.913
- You sure about that, son?
- Trust me.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.851
Next time I have a date, I'll be able to
take her out without setting her on fire.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.147
Well, that's a relief.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.119
I'll be fine.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.532
Hey, Clark, you in here?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.675
It's a little hot in here for candles, Clark.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.012
Mrs. Luthor.

17:30.783 --> 17:34.913
Only at school.
The rest of the time, I prefer "Desiree."

17:35.455 --> 17:37.946
I went by the house, but nobody was home.

17:38.124 --> 17:41.753
- Then I saw the light in the loft.
- Yeah, my parents went into town.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.790
Well, actually I came by to see you.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.256
Really?

17:50.970 --> 17:55.703
You see, most girls like older men,
but not me, I like younger guys.

17:56.476 --> 17:59.934
What they lack in experience,
they make up for in passion.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.445
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

18:03.449 --> 18:07.010
I saw you staring at me
the other day in class.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.949
I'm sorry, I...

18:11.724 --> 18:13.191
No, it's okay.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.354
I was actually flattered.

18:16.563 --> 18:21.557
As a matter of fact, I was hoping we could
work on our student-teacher relations.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.037
You're married to my best friend.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.717
Wait.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.290
I don't know
what you expected here tonight.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.754
But Lex is my best friend.
I'm not gonna do anything to hurt him.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.696
I don't know what came over me.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.293
Please don't tell Lex about this, okay?

19:00.907 --> 19:03.068
I am so sorry.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.852
Oh, so the new Mrs. Luthor has an alias.
That's interesting.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.688
You know, what would you say...

19:21.861 --> 19:25.319
...if I told you Ms. Atkins,
a.k.a. Alison Sanders...

19:25.498 --> 19:28.399
...showed up at my loft last night...

19:28.568 --> 19:30.593
...and tried to seduce me?

19:31.404 --> 19:35.704
I'd say you were living the voyeuristic
fantasy of every male student in this school.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.902
Clark, she just married Lex. Why would
she possibly be interested in you?

19:41.014 --> 19:42.276
Thanks.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.546
Look, she was dissing Lex...

19:44.717 --> 19:47.481
...saying he was the only thing
standing between her and me.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.583
Okay, this is quickly going from merely
nauseating to genuinely disturbing.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.283
I'm not making it up.
She has some strange hold on Lex.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.018
Gee, I wonder what that could be.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.797
I'm serious.
It's more than the fact that she's hot.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.867
Clark, this is Lex Luthor we're talking about.

20:03.036 --> 20:07.097
Don't you think he considered all of the
unfortunate possibilities before saying "I do"?

20:07.507 --> 20:11.341
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
I'm gonna talk to him. Will you keep digging?

20:11.678 --> 20:16.012
Yeah, sure. Where there's smoke,
there's fire. Excuse the aphorism.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.419
Clark, I've been expecting you.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.355
Really?

20:29.128 --> 20:32.256
You can save the awkward silences.
Desiree told me everything.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.795
Lex, I really don't know what to say.

20:35.868 --> 20:39.395
All my life, I've had to second-guess
the intentions of others.

20:40.273 --> 20:44.607
I'd reached the point where I started to
think friends were a luxury I couldn't afford.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.212
Till I met you, Clark.

20:47.380 --> 20:51.373
From the day you pulled me out of the river,
you've been the one person I could trust.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.414
I'm glad you feel that way, Lex.

20:55.221 --> 20:58.486
Maybe that's why I find your infatuation
with my wife so troubling.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.023
My infatuation?

21:02.295 --> 21:05.321
Lex, I don't know what she told you,
but she came on to me.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.159
You expect me to believe that?

21:07.834 --> 21:11.326
Come on, I saw the way
you looked at her the other day.

21:11.504 --> 21:15.167
- She told me you'd been eyeing her in class.
- No, Lex, you have to see this.

21:15.675 --> 21:19.406
Your wife's real name is Alison Sanders.
She grew up in Smallville.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.740
I bet she didn't tell you that, did she?

21:23.583 --> 21:24.845
No.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.918
If she didn't tell the truth about that,
how can you believe...?

21:28.087 --> 21:30.112
She's my wife, and I love her.

21:32.892 --> 21:36.384
To be honest, I was hoping for an apology,
not more insinuations.

21:36.562 --> 21:39.429
- I thought our friendship meant more to you.
- It does.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.559
You can let yourself out.

21:53.579 --> 21:56.810
I don't know what you're doing to Lex,
but I'm not dropping this.

22:01.087 --> 22:04.056
I'm sorry, Lex,
that must have been difficult.

22:04.257 --> 22:05.485
Can you explain this?

22:14.066 --> 22:16.125
Clark's right, I changed my name.

22:20.039 --> 22:23.133
But I changed it again yesterday to "Luthor."

22:24.377 --> 22:26.277
That's all that really matters, isn't it?

22:27.413 --> 22:30.678
I just don't understand
why you would keep this from me.

22:33.586 --> 22:36.248
You know, it seems to me...

22:36.422 --> 22:39.550
...that I haven't had a kiss
from my husband in...

22:39.725 --> 22:41.420
...I don't know, at least six hours.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.358
Desiree, we really need to discuss this.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.941
Clark is part of your past.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.151
Just like everyone else in this town.

23:08.354 --> 23:10.185
You don't need them, Lex.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.515
We don't need them.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.390
Maybe you're right.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.724
So remember, keep your head down.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.027
I'm counting on an exclusive interview
from you when you get back.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.202
- That was great, Chloe.
- Thank you.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.873
Oh, and thanks for the quid pro quo.
Now I can move...

23:29.041 --> 23:32.340
...the library-gets-a-new-paint-job spread
to page two.

23:33.346 --> 23:36.747
So it must have been fun,
spending the entire summer in Metropolis.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.085
Yeah, it was really nice to get away.

23:40.253 --> 23:43.984
Sometimes a little distance can give you
a new perspective on things you've done.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.384
Mistakes you've made.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.692
Going to the spring formal with Clark
was not a mistake.

23:50.897 --> 23:55.357
Yeah, it was. I let myself indulge in my
feelings for him, and I ended up getting hurt.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.533
At least you were brave enough
to take the risk.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.904
Oh, yeah, that's me. Cupid's cannon fodder.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.669
Three months.
I thought I'd be over it by now.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.748
But when I saw him in the hall,
all those feelings came back.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.018
I even made up a lame story
about meeting a guy in Metropolis...

24:14.186 --> 24:16.313
...to try and get a rise out of him.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.225
Clark still really cares about you, Chloe.

24:22.295 --> 24:23.728
I know.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.693
But he cares about you more.

24:26.732 --> 24:30.031
I don't want Clark
to come between our friendship.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.566
Me neither.
So, what are we going to do about that?

24:33.739 --> 24:38.005
Let's define ourselves by what we do,
not who we date.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.608
Or don't date.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.141
Cool.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.305
Lana.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.075
We need to talk.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.783
I have to get some work done
at the Torch.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.287
All right, see you.

24:51.857 --> 24:55.122
I'm really glad to see you.
I just got the final insurance adjustments.

24:55.294 --> 24:58.457
Once you countersign,
we can get started on the repairs.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.658
Lex, I don't understand.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.098
It's not complicated.

25:05.271 --> 25:08.672
I've decided to invoke the buy-out clause
of our partnership agreement.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.234
This gives me 24 hours
to vacate the premises.

25:13.412 --> 25:17.906
That's right. I've decided to re-assess
my business relationships.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.211
The Talon's no longer a good fit.

25:21.487 --> 25:24.320
This isn't fair. The Talon has always
carried its own weight.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.924
Breaking even isn't my idea
of a good business model.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.458
And frankly...

25:28.628 --> 25:32.496
...I question the judgment of a partner who
causes thousands of dollars in damage...

25:32.665 --> 25:36.226
...while entertaining friends after hours.
- I was here with Clark.

25:36.402 --> 25:41.465
My faith in Clark evaporated along with
my enthusiasm for the coffee-shop business.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.611
Lana, what's wrong?

25:52.852 --> 25:55.320
- I've just been evicted from the Talon.
- What?

25:55.655 --> 25:58.317
Lex is using the fire to justify
taking back the building.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.549
No, he can't do that. It wasn't your fault.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.355
He knows that.
He was just looking for an excuse.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.465
People warned me
about doing business with him.

26:07.633 --> 26:10.500
When I saw how hard he fought
to keep the plant open...

26:10.670 --> 26:13.230
...I actually thought he'd changed.

26:13.673 --> 26:17.074
Lana, you brought the Talon back
from nothing. It means everything to you.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.712
And this proves it was never really mine.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.560
Hello, Clark.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.363
Lana looked upset.
Did she tell you what happened?

26:42.535 --> 26:45.732
Yeah, she mentioned that Lex
is closing the Talon, and somehow...

26:45.905 --> 26:48.339
...I think it wasn't completely his decision.

26:48.507 --> 26:49.906
Well, you're right.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.476
We made the decision as a couple.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.842
I wanted to prove a point.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.811
To who? Lana?

26:57.717 --> 26:59.116
No, Clark, to you.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.721
I want you to understand something.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.981
I can control the people in your life.

27:07.693 --> 27:11.185
I had Lex close down the Talon in
a heartbeat. Imagine what would happen...

27:11.363 --> 27:14.764
...if I turned him against this town,
your friends...

27:15.301 --> 27:17.861
...or even your parents.
- I won't let you do that.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.904
You want this to stop?
Then stay out of our lives.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.701
I'm not gonna back off.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.539
And I'll find a way to get through to Lex.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.457
Clark, why didn't you tell us
about this earlier?

28:20.766 --> 28:23.792
I didn't know what to say.
I guess I was embarrassed.

28:23.969 --> 28:27.427
I don't know what we can do about
the Talon. It's not against the law...

28:27.606 --> 28:30.006
...to talk your husband into
a bad business decision.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.610
No, but trying to seduce a teenage boy is.

28:32.778 --> 28:35.076
I'm calling the school board
in the morning...

28:35.247 --> 28:37.306
...and getting this woman suspended.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.717
Yeah.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.551
Ethan. Come on in.

28:46.625 --> 28:47.922
What brings you out here?

28:48.093 --> 28:50.323
A teacher down at the high school,
Mrs. Luthor...

28:50.496 --> 28:52.794
...claims she saw Clark set her car on fire.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.627
That's three suspicious fires
in as many days, Clark.

28:55.801 --> 28:59.202
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take you
into custody until we sort this out.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.134
- Mom, Dad, this is a mistake.
- We know.

29:01.307 --> 29:04.208
Clark, I want you to do what Ethan says.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.774
We'll figure this thing out, I promise.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.641
Just turn around, son.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.821
That's right, I'm selling the building
and everything in it.

29:20.993 --> 29:24.429
Talk to our people in Metropolis
about a price and get back to me.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.961
Mrs. Kent.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.198
I was looking for Nell.

29:29.735 --> 29:32.397
She just left.
I believe she's arranging for the movers.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.836
- Well, I hope I didn't disturb you.
- Mrs. Kent.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.738
I am truly sorry about Clark.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.602
Are you, Lex?

29:50.256 --> 29:53.384
My son is in jail,
and your wife put him there.

29:53.659 --> 29:55.456
Maybe these fires were a cry for help.

29:55.628 --> 29:58.324
Is that you talking,
or is Mrs. Luthor talking through you?

29:58.497 --> 30:00.897
I'd never ask you to take sides
against your husband.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.795
Please don't ask me to doubt my wife.

30:02.968 --> 30:07.632
Any good relationship relies on trust,
but there has to be room to disagree.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.036
Like the way Jonathan and I
disagreed about you.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.171
He couldn't see past the Luthor name.

30:12.344 --> 30:15.108
I always thought
you were truly trying to be Clark's friend.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.681
I'm beginning to think Jonathan
was right all along.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.250
Believe me,
I never wanted it to come to this.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.976
You know Clark.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.781
He's not a criminal.

30:24.023 --> 30:27.686
He's the one person
who's stood by you no matter what.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.691
Ask yourself,
is he really capable of this?

30:31.063 --> 30:32.860
I wouldn't have thought so.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.694
- But I know Desiree.
- Lex...

30:35.868 --> 30:38.894
...you met and married her in a week.

30:39.104 --> 30:41.231
How well could you know her?

30:49.248 --> 30:50.772
Mrs...

31:09.268 --> 31:11.702
Oh, hello, Mr. Kent.

31:16.608 --> 31:19.805
- Are you here to talk about Clark?
- Yes, I am.

31:19.979 --> 31:23.710
And I would prefer to do it fully clothed,
if you don't mind.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.048
Sure.

31:28.821 --> 31:31.119
I'm sorry about your son...

31:31.290 --> 31:32.518
...Mr. Kent.

31:34.860 --> 31:37.795
But you should take this as a warning sign.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.454
Your son is a seriously troubled
young man.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.224
And just how do you figure that?

31:44.436 --> 31:46.131
Isn't it obvious?

31:46.472 --> 31:49.635
He starts fires, then he takes credit
for putting them out.

31:49.808 --> 31:52.800
He told me that he was nowhere
near your car, and I believe him.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.547
Your son is lying to you.
I'm sorry.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.849
You know, I thought I could come out here
and reason with you.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.146
But clearly I was mistaken.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.086
Mr. Kent, wait.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.486
Please, I'm sorry.

32:09.294 --> 32:11.194
You're right about everything.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.997
This all has to do with Lex.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.031
This has got nothing to do
with your husband, Lex Luthor.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.179
I need you to do something for me first.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.623
Sorry we didn't have time
to bake a file into a cake.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.090
How are you holding up?

32:42.261 --> 32:44.593
Besides being accused of
being a serial arsonist...

32:44.763 --> 32:47.960
...and trying to sleep with
my best friend's wife, I'm great.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.393
We've got good news. Chloe followed up
on your Alison Sanders clue.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.367
Apparently our vixen known as Alison...

32:53.539 --> 32:56.235
...was popular with the Smallville boys
even as a teenager.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.569
She was with her boyfriend
when the meteors hit.

32:58.744 --> 33:02.680
The Ledger article doesn't say, but let your
mind wander as to what they were doing.

33:02.848 --> 33:06.477
Few weeks later, he lost it and murdered
her parents. She inherited everything.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.052
Fast-forward five years.
Desiree is now a teacher.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.815
She marries a wealthy executive,
only to see him offed...

33:11.990 --> 33:14.220
...by one of her moonstruck
high-school students.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.851
- Same confession and denial six hours later.
- The classic black-widow scenario.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.794
Only, after murder two,
this black widow had the misfortune...

33:20.966 --> 33:22.831
...of being heavily invested in dot-coms.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.469
After she lost the money,
she decided to go after Lex.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.901
So she tried to seduce me to kill him.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.700
Well, why'd she think I'd do it?

33:29.908 --> 33:32.138
- Pheromones.
- Chloe.

33:32.311 --> 33:35.803
Clark, she was in the throes
of major passion when the meteors hit.

33:35.981 --> 33:40.247
If her pheromone levels were enhanced, she
could get a guy to do whatever she wants.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.679
Lucky for us,
Clark Kent seems to be immune...

33:42.855 --> 33:45.289
...to some members of the opposite sex.

33:51.096 --> 33:52.961
Time's up, girls.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.527
Okay.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.636
Hey, my dad went to go see Desiree.
I gotta get out of here.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.202
Just hang on, okay?

34:17.623 --> 34:18.885
Hold it.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.362
We've gotta get you out of here, Clark.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.126
Stay close to me.

34:32.771 --> 34:33.998
Clark!

34:43.382 --> 34:45.179
We need to talk.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.608
Is something wrong?

34:47.786 --> 34:49.686
I'm not sure.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.850
I know love is supposed to be blind...

34:54.025 --> 34:58.759
...but since meeting you, I feel like I've lost
all sense of reason regarding my friends...

34:58.931 --> 35:01.422
...my business,
and suddenly I don't know why.

35:01.900 --> 35:05.529
Well, it's too late for second thoughts, Lex.
The papers have been finalized.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.501
Everything you have is mine.

35:09.007 --> 35:11.669
You only inherit in the event of my death.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.710
Are you planning to kill me?

35:19.751 --> 35:21.048
No.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.256
He is.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.562
I know you, Mr. Kent.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.337
You're not a murderer. Please...

35:40.539 --> 35:42.336
...put the gun down.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.911
I'm not letting you add Desiree's name
to your list of victims.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.810
She's using you. Whatever she told you,
it's not true.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.251
Dad, don't!

36:29.087 --> 36:30.577
- Dad, you can't do this.
- Clark!

36:33.558 --> 36:34.923
Dad, you okay?

36:51.176 --> 36:52.370
God!

37:26.978 --> 37:28.309
Thanks, Clark.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.975
It's good to have you back.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.616
Well, it's nice to see something
other than jail food.

37:32.784 --> 37:36.845
Well, I just got off the phone with Ethan.
After Lex's statement, the arson...

37:37.522 --> 37:39.513
The arson charges have been dropped.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.660
And from what Ethan said,
I think we've seen the last of Desiree.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.792
What about my escape?

37:44.996 --> 37:48.329
Considering your age and the fact
that you did save Lex Luthor's life...

37:48.500 --> 37:51.196
...they're willing to let you off
with a stern warning.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.835
We're very lucky this time, son.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.469
Did Lex say anything about what happened?

38:00.479 --> 38:03.107
I think we'd both like
to put that way behind us.

38:04.349 --> 38:07.250
And now, Mrs. Kent,
if you are finished here...

38:07.419 --> 38:09.387
...I would like to take you out to dinner.

38:09.554 --> 38:11.385
Solo, if you don't mind, Clark.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.550
I don't mind.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.269
Clark.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.407
I was hoping I'd find you.

38:30.575 --> 38:33.100
Hey, Lex. How you feeling?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.443
Like I'm waking up from a bad dream.

38:37.382 --> 38:40.442
- You really loved her, didn't you?
- I thought I did.

38:41.987 --> 38:46.686
I filed for an annulment, which my lawyers
tell me should be final in a couple days.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.383
I'll let the police deal with Desiree.

38:49.561 --> 38:53.156
- And when that's finished?
- I'll try to be more cautious.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.431
I let my passion get the best of me.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.569
I won't make that mistake again.

38:59.838 --> 39:03.865
Lex, I don't think having passion
is such a bad thing.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.600
You're right, Clark.

39:05.777 --> 39:08.644
Passion for life and work
and friends is great.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.282
As long as you keep it in check.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.651
I should take a page out of your book.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.414
How do you mean?

39:15.821 --> 39:17.448
The way you deal with Lana.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.954
I've always told you to go for it,
but you don't...

39:20.125 --> 39:22.593
...even now that the quarterback's
out of the picture.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.695
I want to, believe me.

39:24.863 --> 39:28.594
But Lana needs to work out her feelings
for Whitney first.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.598
I can wait.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.464
Don't wait too long.

39:39.110 --> 39:43.774
Hi, Whitney. I've been trying to get
this done, but it's been a crazy week.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.583
Still, in a way, I'm glad...

39:46.785 --> 39:51.017
...because it's given me the chance
to think about what I need to say.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.091
- Hey, Clark.
- Hi, Lana.

40:03.268 --> 40:06.328
- Thought I'd help with the repairs.
- Thanks.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.599
Good news is, I think we're
almost ready for our grand reopening.

40:09.774 --> 40:11.435
What's the bad news?

40:11.610 --> 40:14.477
I still can't figure out how to use
the new espresso machine.

40:15.347 --> 40:16.644
Looks very...

40:16.815 --> 40:18.715
...Italian.
- It's a gift from Lex.

40:18.950 --> 40:22.113
Along with roses and an offer to rework
our partnership agreement...

40:22.287 --> 40:24.653
...so that this could never happen again.

40:24.823 --> 40:27.383
Lex told me what happened
with Ms. Atkins and your dad.

40:28.193 --> 40:29.820
It's lucky you were there.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.620
It's funny how she managed
to seduce everyone but you.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.797
Yeah, I guess she just wasn't my type.

40:38.670 --> 40:41.639
And the jailhouse,
how did you manage your escape?

40:42.173 --> 40:45.506
There was a fire. The sheriff opened
the door. I just made a run for it.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.846
Three fires. You were there all three times.

40:51.349 --> 40:52.611
Weird coincidence, huh?

40:53.718 --> 40:56.312
Or just part of the mystery
that is Clark Kent.

41:00.358 --> 41:02.485
How's it going with the tape
for Whitney?

41:04.496 --> 41:06.726
I decided to tell him how I really feel.

41:07.732 --> 41:10.030
What happened to putting on a brave face?

41:10.869 --> 41:14.236
Wasn't fair to either of us.
I haven't been honest about my feelings.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.774
I know it's gonna hurt,
and my timing is crummy...

41:19.444 --> 41:23.904
...but having a relationship that's built
on secrets and lies is doomed to fail.

41:28.954 --> 41:31.081
Don't you think so, Clark?

41:32.824 --> 41:34.121
Absolutely.

41:37.128 --> 41:40.996
Looks like the heat wave's
finally broken. I'm glad.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.794
Yeah, me too.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.330
I should let you finish.

41:51.776 --> 41:53.004
Bye, Lana.

41:54.579 --> 41:56.240
Bye.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.803
Whitney.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.735
I care about you very much.

42:22.907 --> 42:25.307
And I always will.

42:27.112 --> 42:30.309
But we promised that
we'd be honest with each other.

42:30.482 --> 42:32.416
And the truth is...
