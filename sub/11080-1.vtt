01:19.691 --> 01:23.559
My man. All right.
Congratulations.

03:01.393 --> 03:04.021
-l always bet on 22.
-Twenty-two red.

03:04.663 --> 03:06.597
-Come on, let`s go.
-Okay.

03:25.884 --> 03:29.115
lt`s so much fun losing money
for a good cause.

03:30.956 --> 03:32.947
Your bet, Mr. Lowry.

03:47.472 --> 03:50.305
l`ll raise you 2500.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.441
One card.

03:53.912 --> 03:55.402
Last card.

03:59.184 --> 04:00.446
l`m terribly....

04:02.320 --> 04:03.753
Sorry.

04:14.499 --> 04:17.434
And in the savings account...

04:18.136 --> 04:20.127
...1 4 dollars.

04:30.715 --> 04:32.512
Señor Montana to see you, sir.

04:34.886 --> 04:36.376
Luis.

04:38.256 --> 04:40.349
Lovely seeing you again.

04:43.962 --> 04:46.021
Miguel, get him something to drink.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.063
What would you like, sir?

04:54.039 --> 04:57.873
Luis, l`m afraid l have some rather
disappointing news.

04:58.910 --> 05:02.073
Things didn`t go as well for me today
as l had anticipated.

05:02.247 --> 05:06.843
Actually, it was rather novel.
lt was sort of a nice change, losing.

05:07.018 --> 05:08.849
Usually, l`m so lucky at betting.

05:09.020 --> 05:11.818
But, as l always say, if you must lose...

05:12.424 --> 05:14.119
...lose to a good cause.

05:14.292 --> 05:15.884
Stop the bullshit, Lowry.

05:17.696 --> 05:20.563
You borrowed $40,000
from us yesterday...

05:20.732 --> 05:22.632
...and you lost it.

05:22.801 --> 05:26.396
Now, that makes $640,000
you owe us.

05:27.205 --> 05:29.469
Now, when do l see the money?

05:29.641 --> 05:31.666
Luis, you don`t understand.

05:31.843 --> 05:33.970
l don`t gamble because l want to.

05:34.145 --> 05:36.613
With me, gambling is a disease.

05:36.781 --> 05:40.182
People die from that disease, Lowry.

05:40.986 --> 05:43.011
Do you know what l mean?

05:43.188 --> 05:45.748
Yes. Yes, l do.

05:45.991 --> 05:48.357
Let me level with you, Luis.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.550
The truth is:

05:50.729 --> 05:52.287
l`m broke.

05:53.565 --> 05:57.661
-ls there anything else you would like, sir?
-No, Miguel. That will be all.

05:57.836 --> 05:59.133
Chocolate mousse?

05:59.304 --> 06:01.363
-A little cannoli?
-No cannoli!

06:07.913 --> 06:11.007
All l need is a little time.
My uncle is very, very old.

06:11.182 --> 06:13.241
When he dies, l`ll inherit all of this.

06:13.418 --> 06:16.444
All the stocks, the bonds,
the antique French knickknacks.

06:16.621 --> 06:19.954
-Everything you see will be mine.
-Wrong, Lowry.

06:21.393 --> 06:23.554
Most of it will be mine.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.628
The question is, my friend:

06:29.067 --> 06:30.898
How soon?

06:33.004 --> 06:34.471
Soon.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.906
Soon, soon.

06:39.344 --> 06:43.576
He`s on his last leg. l could take you
to him. Would you like to see him?

06:46.618 --> 06:47.915
Miguel.

06:48.286 --> 06:50.618
Okay, Mr. Dennison, just relax.

06:50.789 --> 06:54.020
lt`s time for your oxygen.
There we go.

06:59.764 --> 07:02.460
-How`s he doing?
-Great.

07:02.934 --> 07:04.526
Just great.

07:05.136 --> 07:06.933
Thanks a lot, idiot.

07:07.472 --> 07:09.133
So...

07:09.307 --> 07:12.606
...you`re feeling well, Uncle Albert?

07:21.553 --> 07:23.783
Check the oxygen.
Check his blood pressure.

07:23.955 --> 07:25.183
Get the other unit.

07:25.357 --> 07:28.224
-You all right, sir? Sir?
-Put him on the respirator.

07:28.727 --> 07:31.389
-Those orderlies are too damn good.
-Calm down.

07:31.563 --> 07:33.758
Three weeks.
l`ve only got three weeks.

07:33.932 --> 07:35.593
Sit.

07:36.434 --> 07:39.028
-l`ll be dead before Albert!
-Sit.

07:40.972 --> 07:42.462
Hide.

07:42.640 --> 07:43.902
Europe.

07:44.075 --> 07:45.804
l haven`t got any money.

07:46.578 --> 07:49.445
-Destiny.
-Tranquilizer.

07:51.249 --> 07:53.080
Champagne.

07:55.653 --> 07:57.621
Racing form.

07:59.657 --> 08:02.023
First race.

08:02.727 --> 08:04.854
Deep Trouble in the first.

08:05.030 --> 08:06.793
Second race?

08:06.965 --> 08:08.933
Sudden Death.

08:09.367 --> 08:11.301
Third race.

08:12.037 --> 08:14.528
Whiplash. Wait.

08:15.273 --> 08:16.831
l`ve got it.

08:17.475 --> 08:19.238
Yeah.

08:19.411 --> 08:24.849
What l need are the worst orderlies
in the history of nursing care.

08:40.365 --> 08:42.128
Use a plate, man.

08:44.602 --> 08:45.830
Come on, man.

08:46.571 --> 08:48.630
Come on. Come.

09:09.260 --> 09:12.286
l got you. l love you.

09:26.444 --> 09:29.345
Señor Winslow, this is crazy.

09:29.514 --> 09:31.209
lt will not work.

09:31.616 --> 09:35.575
Don`t tell me what will work.
Of course it will work.

09:35.954 --> 09:39.321
l expect you to just keep silent
about it.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.919
Who took the chocolate cakes?

09:43.094 --> 09:44.322
Buffy.

09:44.929 --> 09:47.830
This is it. This is it. Okay.

09:48.099 --> 09:49.327
Buffy!

09:49.501 --> 09:50.729
Kool!

09:51.136 --> 09:53.036
Mark!

09:53.204 --> 09:54.694
Okay. Okay.

09:54.873 --> 09:57.842
Now, there were 1 6 chocolate cakes
in that refrigerator.

09:58.009 --> 09:59.977
-Where are they?
-l don`t know.

10:00.145 --> 10:02.670
l have had it up to here!

10:02.947 --> 10:05.882
Now, this is the fifth time
that`s happened in a week.

10:06.050 --> 10:10.009
And l wanna know who took them.
l wanna get to the bottom of this.

10:10.188 --> 10:12.622
-l didn`t do it.
-lf you won`t answer me...

10:12.790 --> 10:15.691
...then who had the keys to the refrigerator?

10:15.860 --> 10:16.986
Not me.

10:17.428 --> 10:19.191
-What was that?
-What was what?

10:24.636 --> 10:26.399
Pick those up.

10:26.771 --> 10:29.865
-Come on, chumps.
-l said, pick those up now.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.134
l haven`t got all day. Hurry up.

10:32.310 --> 10:34.801
You. Get under there and help him.

10:34.979 --> 10:38.415
And hurry it up, you fat slobs.

10:38.816 --> 10:40.807
Get up. Now!

10:40.985 --> 10:42.418
Okay.

10:48.359 --> 10:51.556
-You said get up.
-That`s it. You`re fired!

10:51.729 --> 10:52.991
Perfect.

10:53.164 --> 10:54.495
Fired?

10:54.666 --> 10:58.568
-You said get up.
-You can`t fire us. We`re the best you got.

10:59.003 --> 11:01.130
Bye, baby. Be a good boy, now, okay?

11:01.306 --> 11:03.900
Write your brother.
He`ll be looking for a letter.

11:04.075 --> 11:06.669
-Listen, comb your hair.
-l`ll pray every day.

11:06.844 --> 11:09.108
Don`t forget to send
your auntie a postcard.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.374
Buffy, take this book.
lt has Grandma`s home remedies.

11:12.550 --> 11:16.316
And it will cure any illness
or any sickness, okay, baby?

11:16.487 --> 11:18.114
-All right.
-Have a safe ride.

11:18.289 --> 11:20.951
l`m sorry. Excuse me.
You`ll have to disembark now.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.786
The plane`s ready to take off.

11:22.961 --> 11:24.952
Yeah, but, you see, l can`t leave.

11:25.129 --> 11:27.723
Listen, l want you to take care
of yourself.

11:27.899 --> 11:31.391
-This is my child`s first time on a plane.
-He`ll be taken care of.

11:31.569 --> 11:35.232
-Say goodbye, boys.
-Take care of Mr. Dennison, okay?

11:35.406 --> 11:38.307
Now, be good, now.

11:38.810 --> 11:40.437
Buffy, be a good boy.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.944
-Bye, baby. Take care.
-Mom.

11:43.281 --> 11:44.771
-What?
-Do l have to go?

11:44.949 --> 11:47.611
Yes. Now, sit your fat ass
down in that chair...

11:47.785 --> 11:49.252
...and make your mama proud.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.821
You listen, anything happens
to my son, l`m gonna jack you up.

11:52.991 --> 11:56.324
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will be departing shortly.

11:56.494 --> 11:59.827
Please fasten your seat belts,
extinguish all smoking materials.

11:59.998 --> 12:04.697
And make sure your seatbacks and trays
are in the upright and locked position.

12:08.973 --> 12:10.440
Help me!

12:10.642 --> 12:12.701
-You all right?
-Sir, are you all right?

12:12.877 --> 12:14.139
-l`m all right.
-Sure?

12:19.517 --> 12:21.542
l don`t know about this job, man.

12:21.719 --> 12:23.277
You know what l think?

12:23.454 --> 12:25.820
lt`ll be like the jobs we got fired from.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.457
What you talking about, man?

12:27.625 --> 12:30.116
With those jobs,
people didn`t give us a chance.

12:30.295 --> 12:32.729
You see, Mr. Lowry up there
see our potential.

12:32.897 --> 12:34.797
We got to prove ourself.

12:34.966 --> 12:37.161
We got to do right.
We got to be smart.

12:37.335 --> 12:39.963
-Shut up, stupid.
-Man, stop.

12:40.705 --> 12:41.933
Cool it, man.

12:44.809 --> 12:46.037
Sorry. Sorry.

12:55.286 --> 13:00.019
Flight 253 for Atlanta and Dallas
is now departing at gate 2 1.

13:00.191 --> 13:05.128
All passengers holding tickets
for Dallas-Fort Worth on flight 253...

13:05.296 --> 13:07.457
...should present their passes
at gate 2 1.

13:07.632 --> 13:09.691
-Check out that Rolls.
-That`s def, man.

13:09.867 --> 13:11.391
l like that.

13:11.903 --> 13:14.531
-Nice.
-Brothers in Brooklyn would love this.

13:15.206 --> 13:17.299
These are the new orderlies, Fritz.

13:19.010 --> 13:20.637
Hotel shuttles are available...

13:20.812 --> 13:24.043
...at the front entrance of the terminal
at no charge.

13:24.215 --> 13:26.740
-Watch out.
-Yo, man, you can sit in the middle.

13:26.918 --> 13:28.408
l wanna play the window.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.711
-l`m sitting in the car.
-You shouldn`t be here.

13:31.889 --> 13:34.687
lf l sit in the trunk,
the car might pop a wheelie.

13:37.829 --> 13:39.626
-Come on, man.
-Step off, man.

13:39.797 --> 13:41.321
Y`all some suckers.

13:41.499 --> 13:44.559
That`s all right.
That`s why your mother`s a man.

13:59.050 --> 14:01.109
-Hey, Buff. Check this out.
-What`s up?

14:01.285 --> 14:04.721
``Palm Beach city ordinance,
section 2901 :

14:04.889 --> 14:08.154
Shirts and shoes must be worn
in Palm Beach at all times.

14:08.326 --> 14:11.921
Violators are subject to fine,
imprisonment, or both.``

14:12.463 --> 14:13.987
This is ill.

14:14.699 --> 14:15.927
Crazy.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.192
Under arrest?

14:17.368 --> 14:21.737
You`re under arrest for section 2901 ,
jogging without the use of proper apparel.

14:24.142 --> 14:26.542
Damn, they don`t give you
much slack out here.

14:26.811 --> 14:30.975
Hey, hey, hey, you sexy,
sweet young things, you.

14:39.957 --> 14:44.826
--corner of 1 2th and 1 6th, man threatening
a woman with a baseball bat, code three....

14:49.434 --> 14:52.528
Again, l`m terribly sorry about this.

14:52.703 --> 14:54.193
Sergeant.

14:57.275 --> 14:59.573
This place is heavy, man.

15:13.791 --> 15:16.919
God, let me be on my
best behavior, please.

15:28.172 --> 15:29.469
Excuse me.

15:34.645 --> 15:35.942
Nice.

15:36.113 --> 15:38.172
-Damn it.
-Love this.

15:40.485 --> 15:43.352
These can`t possibly be
the new orderlies.

15:43.521 --> 15:45.318
These are the new orderlies.

15:45.690 --> 15:47.089
Chauncey, baby.

15:47.258 --> 15:48.919
Did you miss me?

15:49.093 --> 15:52.654
Here, l`d like to present
Uncle Albert`s new orderlies.

15:59.737 --> 16:01.136
Bad dog. Bad dog.

16:11.816 --> 16:13.408
My name is George.

16:13.584 --> 16:14.812
l am the butler.

16:14.986 --> 16:17.079
l work for Mr. Dennison...

16:17.255 --> 16:19.348
...and my staff work for me.

16:19.524 --> 16:22.322
-What`s up, brother? Yeah.
-What`s up, man?

16:22.493 --> 16:23.858
We will go inside now.

16:24.028 --> 16:25.359
This way.

16:28.332 --> 16:32.428
No. The servants` entrance
is this way.

16:41.979 --> 16:45.437
And this is the Dennison
sitting room.

16:45.983 --> 16:48.918
Yo, this a sitting room, man.
Check it out.

16:49.086 --> 16:51.953
Damn, man. This guy don`t
throw away anything.

16:52.823 --> 16:54.552
Tight squeeze.

16:58.095 --> 17:02.088
-What`s this thing do?
-We only have one rule in this house:

17:02.500 --> 17:04.127
Don`t touch anything.

17:04.301 --> 17:06.202
-You got it, brother.
-Excuse me.

17:19.550 --> 17:20.778
What does this guy do?

17:20.952 --> 17:22.817
He`s like the super.

17:25.189 --> 17:28.157
l love this place. l`m telling you, man.

17:29.060 --> 17:30.618
Nice big hallways.

17:31.662 --> 17:33.755
This place is bigger than my school.

17:33.931 --> 17:37.094
-Oh, my God. l`m in love.
-Nice flowers. You can smell it.

17:43.174 --> 17:44.402
See y`all later.

17:45.576 --> 17:46.838
Poetry in motion.

17:49.914 --> 17:50.903
Don`t...

17:51.082 --> 17:52.071
...touch...

17:52.249 --> 17:53.443
...anything.

17:53.618 --> 17:55.176
Anything.

17:56.554 --> 17:58.021
This way.

18:00.725 --> 18:02.192
Lord...

18:02.360 --> 18:04.794
...please let us be on our best behavior...

18:04.962 --> 18:06.793
...especially Markie.

18:07.164 --> 18:09.689
Please let him keep his dick in his pants.

18:11.469 --> 18:12.800
-l got it.
-l got it.

18:13.337 --> 18:15.100
Oh, no.

18:15.439 --> 18:17.168
l got it!

18:22.313 --> 18:25.942
l know, l know. ``Don`t touch anything.``

18:30.588 --> 18:35.116
You will be expected to totally dedicate
yourself to your patient, Mr. Dennison.

18:35.292 --> 18:38.523
And it is here where you will be spending
most of your time.

18:38.696 --> 18:39.958
lt is the anteroom...

18:40.131 --> 18:42.292
...to Mr. Dennison`s bedchamber.

18:43.434 --> 18:46.631
Now then, over here we have
the medication chart...

18:46.804 --> 18:49.568
...with the pills, time of day, et cetera...

18:49.740 --> 18:52.709
...et cetera, beautifully illustrated.

18:52.877 --> 18:56.142
Now we come to the very heart
of the system:

18:56.313 --> 18:57.803
The pill dispenser.

18:57.982 --> 19:00.473
l want your attention,
and concentrate.

19:00.651 --> 19:01.879
Thank you.

19:02.753 --> 19:04.584
Now then, when the music sounds...

19:04.755 --> 19:08.213
...you hit the iridescent medication
preparation button...

19:08.392 --> 19:12.453
...choose the spectrum selector,
but you must ignore the quantity overdrive.

19:12.630 --> 19:14.097
-Okay.
-And then...

19:14.265 --> 19:17.428
...quite simply, activate
the music terminator...

19:17.601 --> 19:20.331
...and you`re ready for the next time.
Very simple.

19:20.504 --> 19:22.062
Straightforward. No problems?

19:22.239 --> 19:23.763
-No problem. Sure.
-We got it.

19:23.941 --> 19:27.240
Then we shall now introduce
ourselves to Mr. Dennison.

19:27.411 --> 19:28.844
This way.

19:31.949 --> 19:34.042
Come along. Come along.

19:37.021 --> 19:39.785
Hello, Mr. Dennison.
Are you awake, sir?

19:39.957 --> 19:41.720
The new boys are here.

19:41.892 --> 19:44.918

to meet you.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.030
l`ll just gently wake him up.

19:48.733 --> 19:52.965
-What`s that?
-This is his personal transport vehicle.

19:59.610 --> 20:00.872
He looks like Yoda.

20:04.982 --> 20:06.711
Hello, Mr. Dennison.

20:06.884 --> 20:08.852
Mr. Dennison, sir, please wake up.

20:19.263 --> 20:21.356

20:25.870 --> 20:27.895

20:32.710 --> 20:34.075
Hello.

20:34.545 --> 20:36.035
How you doing?

20:38.048 --> 20:40.175

20:40.351 --> 20:42.410
No, Mr. Dennison don`t like you.

20:44.622 --> 20:46.419

20:47.391 --> 20:49.120
What you mean, what l`m doing?

20:49.293 --> 20:51.124
This what l`m doing.

20:51.295 --> 20:52.956
Read this.

21:00.104 --> 21:03.733
lt says it`s a $ 1 ,000-a-plate lunch.

21:03.908 --> 21:06.172
That`s 5 grand there.

21:06.343 --> 21:07.810
Okay?

21:09.313 --> 21:11.611
-Get out of here.
-That`s right.

21:15.052 --> 21:18.351
-Come on. Let`s get out of here.
-Why? Did you steal something?

21:18.522 --> 21:20.046
No, l didn`t steal nothing.

21:20.224 --> 21:22.624
l just don`t wanna be
where l`m not wanted.

21:22.793 --> 21:24.784
You`re always where you`re not wanted.

21:26.697 --> 21:27.959
Boys.

21:28.799 --> 21:30.027
Yes, Mr. Dennison.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.361

21:31.535 --> 21:33.730
-Right away, Mr. Dennison.
-Coming, sir.

21:33.904 --> 21:37.271
Yes, sir, we`ll have you
in your wheelchair in a minute.

21:37.441 --> 21:41.275
-Yeah, let`s get this right.
-This looks like a new lift.

21:42.479 --> 21:43.969
Take that, man.

21:44.148 --> 21:46.241
Take him and hook him up.

21:46.417 --> 21:49.079
Expert orderlies at your service,
Mr. Dennison.

21:49.253 --> 21:52.086
A hundred bucks says
they kill him themselves.

21:52.256 --> 21:54.417
-Don`t know how to work this.
-lt`s fixed.

21:56.527 --> 21:58.256

Help me. Help me.

22:38.636 --> 22:40.160
Turn the wheel.

22:40.337 --> 22:42.362
To the left. To the right.

22:45.609 --> 22:47.474
Get off me. Get off me!

22:48.946 --> 22:50.811
Mom!

22:51.048 --> 22:53.209

22:56.820 --> 23:00.312
You idiot. Put me down. Down!

23:08.032 --> 23:09.966
l want them replaced immediately.

23:10.134 --> 23:12.125
-They`re inept.
-``lnept``?

23:12.303 --> 23:15.636
Uncle Albert, you`re not giving them
a chance.

23:15.806 --> 23:18.969
You bully them. You intimidate them.

23:19.143 --> 23:21.634
They`re sensitive young men.

23:25.316 --> 23:27.284
You must be kidding.

23:28.385 --> 23:32.014
Won`t you give them another chance?
Come on, be a pal.

23:32.723 --> 23:33.951
Please.

23:35.926 --> 23:39.862
-George. What`s up, man? All right.
-George. l love it.

23:43.934 --> 23:45.595

23:47.204 --> 23:51.140
Filet of raw beef
and vegetables du jour.

23:51.542 --> 23:53.510
-``Du jour``?
-Du jour.

23:53.677 --> 23:55.201
You sure?

23:56.413 --> 23:57.937
Taste it, Markie.

23:58.115 --> 23:59.878
Taste it.

24:11.428 --> 24:13.123
Bon appétit.

24:14.465 --> 24:15.864

24:31.415 --> 24:32.643
Yo, Buff.

24:32.816 --> 24:34.613

This place is wack, and you know it, man.

24:47.498 --> 24:50.365
l asked for an old cheeseburger.
Old lousy cheeseburger.

24:50.534 --> 24:52.092
All they got is filet mignon.

24:52.269 --> 24:55.898
l can`t even sit. Every time l sit,
the chair breaks on me.

24:56.173 --> 24:58.971
Yo, l wanna go back
to east New York now, man.

24:59.143 --> 25:00.235

25:09.920 --> 25:12.855
Those new orderlies
are absolutely perfect.

25:13.690 --> 25:16.625
Fifty bucks says
they`re already asleep.

25:49.293 --> 25:53.252
-What are you bringing him for?
-We can`t leave him by hisself.

25:54.331 --> 25:56.765
Yo, Kool, you don`t really need
to leave this.

25:56.934 --> 25:58.492
lf you do, you stupid.

25:58.936 --> 26:00.369
Def.

26:01.171 --> 26:03.139

26:14.918 --> 26:17.318
Hey, how`d you get a car like that?

26:17.488 --> 26:18.716
Want a ride?

26:19.289 --> 26:20.984
Yeah. Come on.

26:24.828 --> 26:26.386

26:32.903 --> 26:34.370
All right.

26:36.306 --> 26:38.831
-Come in here, baby.
-Who`s this?

26:39.009 --> 26:41.637
This is my friend Cool Al over here.

26:42.446 --> 26:44.539
He`s into drugs.

26:45.382 --> 26:47.646
Yeah. Come on, baby. Get in there.

26:47.818 --> 26:50.378
Let`s go. Y`all ready?

26:50.554 --> 26:52.249

26:56.894 --> 27:00.125
We`re taking Kool here
to the bus station. He`s going home.

27:00.297 --> 27:03.130
Markie, l ain`t going nowhere.

27:31.228 --> 27:33.696

27:33.864 --> 27:36.094
l wanna go home.
l wanna go home now.

27:36.266 --> 27:39.394
You don`t need to go home.
Old people need to have fun too.

27:39.570 --> 27:43.233
-That`s right. lt`s in my ma`s book.
-l wanna get out of here.

27:43.407 --> 27:46.774
-lmmediately.
-When was the last time you danced?

27:46.977 --> 27:48.205
Before you were born.

27:48.378 --> 27:51.609
Well, l think it`s about time
you were reborn.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.349
Get me out of here.

28:03.393 --> 28:05.623
Stop. What are you doing?

28:14.071 --> 28:15.561
Get me out of here.

28:20.744 --> 28:22.735
You wanna tango, eh?

28:30.754 --> 28:32.381
Another one?

29:33.383 --> 29:34.873
Look at them!

29:52.636 --> 29:55.833
-You all right, Mr. Dennison?
-You all right, Albert?

30:00.544 --> 30:02.603
You guys kill me.

30:03.013 --> 30:05.413
Another night like this,
and l`ll die.

30:05.582 --> 30:08.710
You can`t die, Albert.
lf you die, we`ll lose this job.

30:15.959 --> 30:17.927
Why don`t you be quiet, man!

30:20.464 --> 30:22.159
How do you like that, fatso?

30:23.133 --> 30:25.795
l`ll telling you, man,
you better watch yourself.

30:32.676 --> 30:34.143
The hell is wrong with you?

30:34.311 --> 30:36.370
-Keep it down.
-l told you to shut up.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.245
Man, chill out.

30:40.617 --> 30:42.414
Stop bugging.

31:34.271 --> 31:37.399
You have ruined my plans...

31:37.574 --> 31:39.041
...for the evening.

31:39.776 --> 31:41.676
Listen. From now on...

31:41.845 --> 31:44.313
...l want Albert at home
where he belongs...

31:44.481 --> 31:45.914
...where he`s safe...

31:46.082 --> 31:47.845
...where he`s loved.

31:48.552 --> 31:50.019
Chill out, Winslow.

31:52.923 --> 31:57.155
We just went to an all-night drugstore
to get some special medicine.

31:57.327 --> 31:58.624
lt worked.

31:58.795 --> 32:00.160
No!

32:00.330 --> 32:02.264
No! No, no!

32:10.440 --> 32:12.499
That dog is a bigot, man.

32:13.510 --> 32:15.671
No, he just likes dark meat.

32:18.682 --> 32:20.206
Bad dog.

32:21.218 --> 32:24.449
Bad dog, bad dog.

32:24.754 --> 32:27.348
l think that`s enough excitement
for one night.

32:27.858 --> 32:30.884
Let`s all get to bed,
see if we can get some rest.

32:32.395 --> 32:34.226
Get that dog out, man.

32:34.397 --> 32:37.833
Mr. Lowry, keep that dog
away from me, man.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.804
No one`s scared of that dog, man.

32:41.972 --> 32:43.200
Kick that dog`s ass.

32:43.373 --> 32:44.931
You know, Uncle Albert...

32:45.108 --> 32:50.171
...l think it`s terribly unfair of you
to put me through all this worry.

32:50.647 --> 32:53.081
Step off, homeboy.

34:03.620 --> 34:06.054
Hey. How you doing?

34:21.271 --> 34:25.900
lt`s always a tragedy
when someone so young...

34:26.076 --> 34:31.036
...so vibrant is taken from our midst.

34:31.514 --> 34:35.109
But we can console ourselves by realizing...

34:35.284 --> 34:39.619
...how fortunate we were
to have had Chauncey with us...

34:39.789 --> 34:42.188
...however briefly.

35:06.516 --> 35:09.815
-Man, you can`t do nothing right, man.
-Okay, fellas...

35:09.986 --> 35:13.353
...let`s play some cards.
Check this out, check this out.

35:13.523 --> 35:16.856
Separate these into piles.
This how it`s gonna be.

35:17.027 --> 35:20.087
The red ones, right, they gonna
be worth 1 00 bucks.

35:20.263 --> 35:24.563
The green-and-orange ones gonna be 50.
The red-and-white ones gonna be 25.

35:24.734 --> 35:29.637
The little ones there,
make those 1 0 bucks, 1 0 bucks.

35:41.184 --> 35:44.347
Okay, l raise you...

35:45.488 --> 35:48.013

35:50.293 --> 35:53.751
Bid daddy done did it again.

35:54.664 --> 35:57.132
Why is this door locked? Open it at once.

35:57.300 --> 35:58.631
Shit. The super.

35:58.802 --> 36:02.238
-Quick, cover it up.
-What on earth is going on in there?

36:03.273 --> 36:04.831
l`m coming.

36:05.008 --> 36:08.466
Be right there. Let me get my sneakers.

36:09.212 --> 36:10.543

36:11.214 --> 36:14.650
And now l`m coming. Fix my shoe.

36:17.887 --> 36:21.846
-My man!
-l am? How very nice for you.

36:27.363 --> 36:28.921
Hey, Chauncey.

36:29.099 --> 36:31.090
Here, have a bite.

36:31.735 --> 36:34.465
Better yet, here, take a bite.

36:34.637 --> 36:37.970
Go ahead. Sucker!

36:42.045 --> 36:43.945
Hey, Carla. What`s up?

36:46.649 --> 36:49.846
Hey, Haile, hold on a sec.
l`m gonna let you in.

36:50.687 --> 36:52.552
What`s up, man? Come on back, man.

36:52.722 --> 36:55.850
That will be $89.76.

36:56.025 --> 36:59.222
Put it on the Dennison bill.
Be cool, man. Thanks a lot.

37:03.666 --> 37:05.395
Hey, Carla.

37:05.802 --> 37:07.827

37:08.404 --> 37:10.463
Why don`t me and you
go up to my room...

37:10.640 --> 37:12.540
...and do the wild thing.

37:12.709 --> 37:13.971
The wild thing?

37:14.144 --> 37:16.112
-Yeah.
-No way.

37:16.279 --> 37:18.474
Look. Look. On the serious tip.

37:18.748 --> 37:21.308
-Why don`t me and you go to a movie.
-Yeah.

37:22.652 --> 37:24.916
-You really wanna go out with me?
-Yeah.

37:25.088 --> 37:27.079
You gotta eat this instead of that...

37:27.257 --> 37:31.353
...and get rid of all that blubber
and tons of that fat.

37:35.231 --> 37:36.926
Sprouts?

37:37.567 --> 37:39.626
All right, l`ll eat it.

37:41.771 --> 37:43.534
lt`s worth it.

37:57.587 --> 38:00.784

-All right! My man!

38:00.957 --> 38:03.448
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

38:03.726 --> 38:05.694
Take the soda while l take this here.

38:05.862 --> 38:07.227
Don`t touch that pizza.

38:20.243 --> 38:21.938
What`s that, man?

38:22.111 --> 38:23.510

38:26.850 --> 38:28.943
That`s bugging.

38:30.019 --> 38:35.013
Don`t you like this? Want some?

-Yeah.

Eat this.

38:51.507 --> 38:52.974

You said you were hungry.

39:01.351 --> 39:03.080
Markie, where the pills, man?

39:03.253 --> 39:04.811
-What pills?
-``What pills?``

39:04.988 --> 39:07.923
The pills you left the room with, stupid!

39:08.558 --> 39:11.049
-Who you calling stupid, man?
-You!

39:15.465 --> 39:18.025
l`ll go downstairs and check it out.
Don`t worry.

39:18.334 --> 39:21.167
You better. Albert needs
those pills to stay alive.

39:21.337 --> 39:22.565
That`s right, man.

39:22.906 --> 39:25.033
Like l don`t know.

39:26.743 --> 39:27.732
You all right?

39:54.871 --> 39:56.099
Oh, no.

40:06.883 --> 40:09.010
-Yo, Buff.
-Yo.

40:09.185 --> 40:11.949
Yo, remember when your
uncle Louie was real sick...

40:12.121 --> 40:14.885
...and he was taking those pills
to make him better?

40:15.058 --> 40:18.994
He had one big blue pill for his heart.
That gave him indigestion.

40:19.295 --> 40:22.856
One red pill for his indigestion.
That gave him high blood pressure.

40:23.032 --> 40:25.796
One big horse pill for his blood,
that made him fart.

40:25.969 --> 40:28.699
He stopped taking pills
and started feeling better.

40:29.005 --> 40:30.996
Markie, where the pills?

40:31.474 --> 40:33.442
Carla. She threw them out.

40:33.609 --> 40:35.634
-What?
-What she do that for, man?

40:35.812 --> 40:38.212
-l don`t know, man.
-Oh, shit.

40:38.381 --> 40:41.817
Albert`s gonna die, man!
l knew it, man! l knew it!

40:41.985 --> 40:44.146
l knew it would happen.
lt`s your fault.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.787
-lt`s Carla`s fault.
-Your fault.

40:45.955 --> 40:48.116
Stop beefing, man.
Everything is my fault.

40:48.291 --> 40:50.350
Cut it out, man. Cut it out, man.

40:50.526 --> 40:54.053
What we gonna do?
Albert can`t live without those pills.

40:54.931 --> 40:56.865
What about my pills, gentlemen?

40:58.668 --> 41:01.569
-What`s going on?
-Dr. Lewis....

41:01.738 --> 41:05.504
He changed the prescription.
You should stay off pills till tomorrow.

41:05.675 --> 41:07.108
Really?

41:13.182 --> 41:15.377
l guess the doctor knows
what he`s doing.

41:15.551 --> 41:17.485
He sure does.

41:18.788 --> 41:21.382
Will you guys please stop illing.

41:21.557 --> 41:23.081
Somebody`s gonna get hurt.

41:24.861 --> 41:27.386
Okay, Mr. Dennison.
See you later.

41:27.563 --> 41:29.428
Okay.

41:30.199 --> 41:32.133
What`s wrong, man?

41:40.176 --> 41:43.339
Kool, check his reflexes.
l`ll check his breathing.

41:49.352 --> 41:51.081
l can`t see anything, man.

42:07.136 --> 42:09.434
There`s no pressure, man.

43:12.468 --> 43:15.437
Mark, Kool.

43:17.940 --> 43:19.635
What`s up?

43:28.618 --> 43:31.018
Listen, doc, it`s a matter
of life and death.

43:31.187 --> 43:33.155
-Don`t tell me that.
-How is he?

43:33.322 --> 43:35.813
Look, it`s almost 1 2.
He hasn`t woke up yet.

43:36.792 --> 43:40.125
Damn! The pharmacy`s out
of the prescription, man.

43:40.429 --> 43:42.226
You killed him! Look what you did.

43:42.398 --> 43:44.662
l told you, l didn`t do it.
Carla did it.

43:44.834 --> 43:47.667
-Chill.
-Maybe give him some vitamins, man.

43:48.671 --> 43:50.298
What`s all the noise in here?

43:51.474 --> 43:53.908
There`s something wrong with Mr. Albert.

43:54.477 --> 43:55.705
-Really?
-Yes.

43:55.878 --> 43:58.142
He hasn`t woke up
and his heart rate is low.

43:58.314 --> 43:59.645
Pulse is weak.

43:59.815 --> 44:02.249
Poor Albert.

44:02.952 --> 44:06.718
l had a premonition something terrible
would happen today.

44:06.889 --> 44:11.019
-l`ll go call the hospital.
-Better tell them to send a chaplain.

44:11.661 --> 44:14.494
l can`t, man. l can`t tell him.

44:14.797 --> 44:18.392
-Man, we`ll get fired.
-We`ll lose this job anyway if he dies.

44:18.568 --> 44:20.729
-You have to tell him.
-l can`t, man.

44:20.903 --> 44:23.337
Maybe the paramedics
will bring some pills.

44:23.506 --> 44:26.202
You gotta tell him. You gotta.

44:26.375 --> 44:29.742
Come on, be a man, not a girl.
Go ahead.

44:29.912 --> 44:32.676
-Chapel of the Pines funeral home?
-Mr. Lowry!

44:32.848 --> 44:36.215
Just a moment. May l speak
to Mr. Thorton?

44:37.153 --> 44:39.280
Bill, this is Winslow Lowry.

44:39.455 --> 44:41.548
-Mr. Lowry.
-Just a moment.

44:41.724 --> 44:43.055
l`m afraid it`s time.

44:45.861 --> 44:47.852
He`s having a spasm!

44:48.030 --> 44:51.397
-A spasm!
-Stop him, man! Hurry up!

44:51.901 --> 44:54.199
We gotta stop him, man!

44:54.370 --> 44:56.167
-Stop him, man.
-Stop.

44:56.339 --> 44:58.398
CPR! CPR!

44:58.975 --> 45:02.706
-Two, three, four.
-No!

45:02.878 --> 45:07.281
Move, man, mouth-to-mouth!
Mouth-to-mouth! Mouth-to-mouth!

45:14.290 --> 45:16.258
See how you like it!

45:16.425 --> 45:18.916
Two, three, four, five...

45:19.095 --> 45:20.892
...six, seven, eight!

45:23.165 --> 45:26.862
He looks surprisingly good, considering
the blows that he suffered.

45:27.403 --> 45:28.927
But what about my uncle?

45:29.105 --> 45:30.800
How did he get better?

45:30.973 --> 45:32.634
He was overmedicated before.

45:32.808 --> 45:35.777
They lucked into something
when they lost his medication.

45:35.945 --> 45:39.176
-They what?
-They lost his pills.

45:39.348 --> 45:43.512
l heard them. They bungled their way
into a breakthrough in Albert`s treatment.

45:43.686 --> 45:46.519
Amazing the way luck can play
a part in recovery.

45:46.689 --> 45:50.250
He`ll be back on the golf course
in no time at all.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.385
Amazing.

46:03.372 --> 46:05.306
Do l feel great!

46:05.474 --> 46:07.339
And l owe it all to you guys.

46:07.510 --> 46:11.503
Now that l`m young again,
l`m gonna show you boys the fun l had...

46:11.681 --> 46:12.943
...when l was your age.

46:13.115 --> 46:17.176
We`re gonna go skeet shooting,
we`re gonna go yachting.

46:17.353 --> 46:19.253
We`re going on safari.

46:19.422 --> 46:23.222
And we`ll go looking for women
in remote spots around the world.

46:23.392 --> 46:26.088
-Sound good?
-Yeah!

46:26.262 --> 46:29.197
We`ll have a great time,
the five of us.

46:29.365 --> 46:31.356
Right, Winslow?

46:32.501 --> 46:34.162
Right.

46:35.671 --> 46:37.536
You know, Albert...

46:37.707 --> 46:41.165
...we were afraid that, since
you`re better now, you know...

46:41.344 --> 46:44.507
...you won`t be needing us no more
and might fire us.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.615
Fire you? l`ll never fire you guys.

46:47.783 --> 46:49.273
You may be unorthodox...

46:49.452 --> 46:52.580
...but you certainly get results.

46:53.289 --> 46:55.416
A stroke goes like this.

46:57.126 --> 46:59.390
Okay, go ahead, Markie.

47:24.120 --> 47:26.486
Get me off this thing.

47:29.892 --> 47:31.655
Chill, horse!

47:32.895 --> 47:34.726
No, stop!

47:41.103 --> 47:43.196
Okay, horse, it`s our turn.

47:46.342 --> 47:48.037
That`s right.

48:43.566 --> 48:44.794
Out, good. ln.

48:44.967 --> 48:47.458
Out, in, out.

48:47.837 --> 48:51.603
ln. Come on. ln. Out.

49:11.060 --> 49:13.290
Great Jesus Palomino.

49:19.368 --> 49:23.395
-United States Treasury note, $ 1 0,000.
-What?

49:30.246 --> 49:33.079
Enough is enough.
lt`s time to play hardball.

49:33.249 --> 49:37.345
No more natural causes, no more
medications, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

49:37.520 --> 49:40.978
Albert is dead tonight. lt`s gonna
look like those morons did it.

49:50.099 --> 49:51.999
Lowry lives all right.

49:52.167 --> 49:54.328
Check this out.

49:56.005 --> 49:57.939
Guns.

49:58.474 --> 50:01.910
We take these back to Brooklyn,
man, we run things.

50:04.046 --> 50:06.037
Scopes.

50:06.749 --> 50:08.341
Yo!

50:11.954 --> 50:14.320
Yo, this is def!

50:16.058 --> 50:18.856
You got to be rich to have something
like this.

50:19.028 --> 50:20.256
Yo! A video camera!

50:22.865 --> 50:25.595
-Let`s make a video.
-This`ll work. This`ll work.

50:26.035 --> 50:27.866
l`ll turn this on right here.

50:28.971 --> 50:30.268
Set up here.

50:30.439 --> 50:31.770
Power.

50:31.941 --> 50:34.307
-Video.
-Camera focus.

50:36.412 --> 50:40.212
-Camera ready.
-Take one.

50:40.382 --> 50:42.282
And action!

54:34.416 --> 54:37.874
Hey! Let`s get out of here
before Lowry comes.

54:44.326 --> 54:45.554
All fixed.

54:45.861 --> 54:48.386
You may have to get
that computer repaired.

54:51.466 --> 54:53.991
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

55:12.754 --> 55:15.188
Luis Montana, please.

55:17.059 --> 55:19.960
Luis? Lowry.

55:20.462 --> 55:23.829
l-- l can-- Luis, l can have
your money for you tomorrow.

55:24.900 --> 55:29.564
No, no, no. l have a plan,
but l need your help.

55:35.677 --> 55:38.202
What`s going on next door?

55:40.148 --> 55:41.513
What`s that, man?

55:46.221 --> 55:47.882
Damn!

55:55.764 --> 55:58.232
God bless them, God bless them.

56:00.936 --> 56:04.201
-Have you given the staff tomorrow off?
-Of course.

56:04.373 --> 56:07.365
-There won`t be a soul in sight...
-Good.

56:07.542 --> 56:09.510
...for the rest of the night.

56:47.883 --> 56:49.646
You guys are late.

56:53.522 --> 56:55.387
Not that late.

56:58.994 --> 57:00.723
What do you think, man?

57:01.063 --> 57:02.758
Too skinny.

57:03.198 --> 57:05.530
Too skinny. Too damn skinny.

57:05.867 --> 57:07.892
You can see their bones and shit.

57:08.070 --> 57:10.095
They look like bicycles.

57:10.405 --> 57:14.273
-l want a woman who looks like a Cadillac.
-l know what you mean.

57:15.844 --> 57:18.677
Oh, man, look at those jugs.
l`m telling you.

57:21.116 --> 57:23.209
Look at that butt, man.

57:23.385 --> 57:25.046
Like a pancake.

57:33.595 --> 57:36.359
Hello, police? Help, there`s peeping Toms!

57:37.466 --> 57:40.560
-Let`s go, man. Let`s get out of here.
-My head! My head!

58:04.993 --> 58:06.585
Damn peeping Toms.

58:06.762 --> 58:11.597
This is the police!
Come out and give yourselves up!

58:14.770 --> 58:17.398
Oh, shit. Cops are shooting at us, man!

58:19.374 --> 58:24.368
For looking at some ugly girls! This place
is stupid crazy. l`m getting out of here.

59:07.155 --> 59:09.055
Man, oh, man.

59:11.126 --> 59:13.356
Damn! lt`s locked!

59:24.372 --> 59:25.600
Harry, where are you?

59:25.774 --> 59:29.608
-Come on, man, get up!
-Let`s get out of here!

59:30.011 --> 59:31.410
Hang on. l`m on my way.

59:36.218 --> 59:38.186
Let`s get out of here.

59:39.721 --> 59:41.746
Open it! Open it!

59:44.059 --> 59:45.458
Get in! Get in!

59:46.128 --> 59:47.356
Yo, man!

59:47.529 --> 59:49.656
Get out of here, man!

59:50.499 --> 59:52.194
You`re blowing everything!

59:52.367 --> 59:55.165
-We gotta hide! We gotta hide!
-Not here, you ain`t.

59:55.337 --> 59:58.170
Get up, man! Get up!

59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.570
-Get off me!
-Police is after us!

01:00:00.742 --> 01:00:03.302
-Why, what`d you do?
-Look at naked girls.

01:00:03.478 --> 01:00:04.706
-What?
-Naked girls.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.440
Break it up, man. We gotta hide.

01:00:07.616 --> 01:00:09.083
Open up.

01:00:09.251 --> 01:00:10.479
Open up!

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.416
l hate you guys, man!

01:00:15.457 --> 01:00:17.254
Move out of the way!

01:00:17.859 --> 01:00:20.726
-You can`t fit under there!
-Open this door now!

01:00:26.234 --> 01:00:28.134
Mr. Officer, sir, l don`t know them.

01:00:28.303 --> 01:00:31.761
They broke in on me and my girl.
l got nothing to do with it.

01:00:32.307 --> 01:00:36.004
Mr. Dennison, man, tell them
we didn`t do nothing, man.

01:00:36.178 --> 01:00:38.646
Don`t let them take us away.

01:00:40.815 --> 01:00:42.749
Quit pushing me, man.

01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:49.752
Sir. We found the bullet hole.
lt was in Mr. Dennison`s room.

01:00:49.925 --> 01:00:51.552
Looks like someone shot at him.

01:00:51.726 --> 01:00:53.717
l don`t understand this, detective.

01:00:53.895 --> 01:00:56.523
Someone tried to kill you.
Could have been them.

01:00:56.698 --> 01:01:00.156
That`s impossible. My orderlies
are very nice boys.

01:01:00.602 --> 01:01:03.332
Did you actually see
who took a shot at you?

01:01:03.638 --> 01:01:07.130
-No.
-So you can`t say it wasn`t the orderlies.

01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:11.439
-Well, no. l can`t.
-lf l may suggest something, sergeant.

01:01:11.613 --> 01:01:13.080
l didn`t want to say...

01:01:13.481 --> 01:01:16.712
...but l`ve noticed several items missing
from the house.

01:01:17.118 --> 01:01:18.585
Are you suggesting--?

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.183
-Let`s have a look in their rooms.
-Right this way, please.

01:01:23.058 --> 01:01:25.549
-l don`t know what`s going on.
-l don`t either.

01:01:26.995 --> 01:01:30.431
-Open them up.
-What do they think they`re gonna find?

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:32.624
They`re good boys.
They don`t do wrong.

01:01:32.801 --> 01:01:36.134
That`s one of my trophies
from the den.

01:01:36.671 --> 01:01:38.935
Well, well.

01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:48.580
Get those jerks down to the station.

01:01:49.417 --> 01:01:51.317
But, Mr. Dennison, man!

01:01:51.486 --> 01:01:54.819
l can`t go to jail.
My mother`s gonna kill me!

01:01:56.157 --> 01:02:00.218
Believe me, l don`t think the boys could
have had anything to do with this.

01:02:00.395 --> 01:02:04.024
-l don`t know, Carla.
-Luis? Lowry.

01:02:04.199 --> 01:02:07.259
-l didn`t hear him come in.
-I can have the money tomorrow.

01:02:07.435 --> 01:02:10.871
No, no, no. I have a plan. I need your help.

01:02:11.339 --> 01:02:15.400
If you help me kill Albert,
I can make it look like the orderlies did it.

01:02:15.577 --> 01:02:19.479
-Luis, I assure you....
-Did you hear that?

01:02:19.748 --> 01:02:22.308
That no-good, two-timing snake.

01:02:22.484 --> 01:02:23.951
Son of a bitch.

01:02:24.152 --> 01:02:27.883
-What...?
-l`m gonna take this to the police.

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:32.492
Carla, help Albert downstairs.
l`m gonna go ahead and get the car.

01:02:49.978 --> 01:02:51.707
Oh, no.

01:02:53.381 --> 01:02:54.848
Oh, Markie!

01:02:56.951 --> 01:02:59.715
Hello, Uncle Albert.

01:03:00.055 --> 01:03:02.819
-No!
-Save the talk.

01:03:02.991 --> 01:03:04.549
Let`s tie them up.

01:03:04.726 --> 01:03:06.523
Yes.

01:03:08.163 --> 01:03:10.495
Something is weird, man.

01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:13.532
Yeah. Somebody put that gun
in our luggage.

01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:16.637
Someone who wanna wax Albert.

01:03:17.105 --> 01:03:18.436
Who?

01:03:18.606 --> 01:03:21.700
l don`t know. Maybe the super did it.

01:03:21.876 --> 01:03:24.071
No. l think it`s Miguel.

01:03:24.479 --> 01:03:28.575
What would Miguel get out of
killing Albert? Lowry get all his money.

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:30.183
Yeah, you`re right.

01:03:30.352 --> 01:03:32.912
Must be Lowry. That snake.

01:03:33.088 --> 01:03:34.578
Yeah.

01:03:34.756 --> 01:03:37.088
He set us up from the beginning.

01:03:38.093 --> 01:03:40.891
We don`t stand a chance.
The cops`ll never believe us.

01:04:00.048 --> 01:04:02.107
l`m tired of waiting.

01:04:04.819 --> 01:04:07.117
l want a confession...

01:04:08.323 --> 01:04:10.018
...and l want it now.

01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.752
-Confess!
-All right, it`s like this.

01:04:12.927 --> 01:04:15.259
-Lowry put the gun in our luggage.
-Exactly.

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:17.625
Shut up!

01:04:19.267 --> 01:04:21.861
Now, you boys had better
start talking sense...

01:04:22.237 --> 01:04:24.899
...or l`m gonna use
a Florida lie detector.

01:04:26.574 --> 01:04:28.166
What`s a Florida lie detector?

01:04:28.376 --> 01:04:30.401
A Florida lie detector...

01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:33.809
...is a 300-pound white man
with a baseball bat.

01:04:33.982 --> 01:04:38.248
-Goddamn! What`s he gonna do?
-What`s that for?

01:04:38.853 --> 01:04:40.411
Hey, what`s that for?

01:04:40.588 --> 01:04:42.419
You gonna demolish us?

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:44.421
What y`all doing?

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.328
Can somebody answer me?

01:04:58.106 --> 01:05:00.006
Come on! Get him up here!

01:05:00.975 --> 01:05:03.842
l saw you jogging.
You can move faster than that.

01:05:04.212 --> 01:05:06.237
-What is he saying?
-Shut up.

01:05:09.884 --> 01:05:13.547
-Come on! Let`s go!
-Get him in there!

01:05:20.762 --> 01:05:22.320
-Wait`ll l get loose.
-What?

01:05:22.497 --> 01:05:24.294
-Gonna fly that head.
-Shut him up!

01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:26.457
My pleasure.

01:05:26.634 --> 01:05:30.092
l`ll just give them an extra-fat dose
of the knockout drug.

01:05:30.271 --> 01:05:32.330
Get him over here.

01:05:33.308 --> 01:05:35.173
All right, Albert.

01:05:35.343 --> 01:05:38.005
-Open that safe!
-No!

01:05:38.279 --> 01:05:40.975
Uncle Albert, please.

01:05:41.149 --> 01:05:42.309
No!

01:05:42.784 --> 01:05:44.376
For me?

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.086
You son of a bitch!

01:05:49.424 --> 01:05:51.392
Get him over there and tie him up.

01:05:53.928 --> 01:05:55.452
Relax.

01:05:55.630 --> 01:06:01.000
First, we`ll blow open the door to the safe
so we can get the money out.

01:06:01.169 --> 01:06:04.798
Then, we`ll rig a second big explosion
to take care of these three.

01:06:05.974 --> 01:06:08.033
Yo, look, Mr. Officer-Sergeant, sir.

01:06:08.409 --> 01:06:10.741
l want to point out
an unfair situation.

01:06:10.912 --> 01:06:13.745
Shut your fat, ugly face!

01:06:17.018 --> 01:06:19.543
These guys gonna kick our asses, man.

01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:21.951
We gonna be hurt,
but Albert gonna be dead!

01:06:36.738 --> 01:06:38.729
Now, watch this.

01:06:39.974 --> 01:06:44.434
-That`s def.
-Watch this Brooklyn boy go to work.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.179
Get under there.

01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:58.649
What happened?

01:07:01.195 --> 01:07:02.526
l don`t know. The brakes?

01:07:02.697 --> 01:07:05.564
What the hell`s the matter with you?
You crazy?

01:07:07.835 --> 01:07:09.962
Oh, no.

01:07:14.142 --> 01:07:18.010
-My neck is just killing me.
-l don`t know how this happened.

01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:25.582
You gotta be from Brooklyn to do this.

01:07:25.753 --> 01:07:27.983
l`m telling you,
you know what l`m saying?

01:07:28.389 --> 01:07:30.289
Yeah.

01:07:30.725 --> 01:07:32.386
Yeah, boy.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.653
Got it.

01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:43.236
Hey! That`s our car!

01:07:49.477 --> 01:07:52.446
-Steer this thing right!
-We got the right of way, man.

01:07:53.514 --> 01:07:56.142
Yo! Don`t worry about it.

01:08:01.022 --> 01:08:03.923
-Don`t worry about it!
-You got it, you got it.

01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:17.169
God, Jesus Christ.

01:08:25.246 --> 01:08:28.443
We`re gonna die, we`re gonna die!

01:08:34.122 --> 01:08:36.488
-We def, man.
-Real def.

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:38.888
Give me this hanger.
Let`s get out of here.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.051
Word.

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:44.225
Check me out. Check me out.

01:08:57.345 --> 01:09:00.974
-Please, Miguel, l`ll do it. l`ll do it.
-Careful. Careful.

01:09:13.493 --> 01:09:17.055
Scatter some around so it looks like
it went up in the explosion.

01:09:17.231 --> 01:09:19.198
No. Not too much.

01:09:19.367 --> 01:09:22.063
We`ll get the wheelbarrow,
put the rest in the van.

01:09:22.236 --> 01:09:24.397
The van? What do you mean?

01:09:24.572 --> 01:09:28.064
The money can`t be here when
the police get here, now, can it?

01:09:28.242 --> 01:09:29.470
He`s got a point.

01:09:29.644 --> 01:09:33.603
But l have to be here for the alibi.

01:09:33.781 --> 01:09:37.683
You`ll just have to trust me, won`t you?

01:09:41.389 --> 01:09:45.120
Oh, sure. l trust you.

01:09:51.099 --> 01:09:52.327
Yo, Kool...

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.401
-...that`s a hit, man.
-Let`s go.

01:09:56.671 --> 01:09:59.504
-You! Stop this car!
-Hey, you deaf?

01:09:59.674 --> 01:10:01.005
Stop this car.

01:10:01.175 --> 01:10:02.802
Right here.

01:10:04.812 --> 01:10:08.543
-Let me check your ``speedanometer.``
-Speedometer, man.

01:10:08.716 --> 01:10:10.377
l was only going 25.

01:10:10.785 --> 01:10:15.245
Our radar clocked you doing 40. Now, get
out the car. l ain`t got time for your crap.

01:10:15.423 --> 01:10:16.822
-Come on.
-Hey, hey.

01:10:16.991 --> 01:10:20.290
Get on the ground, man. Get on the ground.

01:10:20.661 --> 01:10:22.219
Come on, man, let`s go.

01:10:22.396 --> 01:10:24.296
Facedown!

01:10:24.465 --> 01:10:26.456
l`ll check your ``speedronometer.``

01:10:26.701 --> 01:10:30.228
-Speedometer, man. Let`s get out of here.
-Speedometer.

01:10:33.207 --> 01:10:35.232
What you looking at?
Get on the ground.

01:10:35.409 --> 01:10:38.071
We`ll be right back. Wait right here.

01:10:44.385 --> 01:10:47.548
Don`t drop me, please. Don`t drop me, man.

01:10:50.725 --> 01:10:52.659
Hurry up. Let`s go.

01:10:55.229 --> 01:10:56.457
We ain`t got all day!

01:10:58.099 --> 01:11:00.033
Come on, fat man, get with it!

01:11:00.201 --> 01:11:03.466

Gonna catch a heart attack.

01:11:08.643 --> 01:11:10.668
Damn! All those guys got guns.

01:11:21.455 --> 01:11:24.652
-Now we`re going to have some fun.
-Oh, good.

01:11:33.768 --> 01:11:36.635
Now we got guns too.

01:11:41.342 --> 01:11:43.310
Too slow.

01:11:43.945 --> 01:11:45.674
That`ll work.

01:11:55.456 --> 01:11:56.684
Now we need bullets.

01:11:58.492 --> 01:12:00.221
Bingo.

01:12:14.775 --> 01:12:16.208
-ls that ready?
-lt`s ready.

01:12:16.377 --> 01:12:18.641
-Run it through the tunnel.
-Leave it to me.

01:12:18.813 --> 01:12:20.371
Quick.

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:23.578
Ready?

01:12:23.751 --> 01:12:26.049
Let`s get busy now.

01:12:26.954 --> 01:12:29.218

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:35.390
Yo, don`t point that gun at me, man!

01:12:41.335 --> 01:12:43.269

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:58.177
You crazy, man! You are sick, man.

Crazy. l don`t believe you.

01:13:06.027 --> 01:13:08.757
-You could have killed us!
-l was trigger-happy.

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:11.194
How we gonna deal with these kids?

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.961
These guys are unbelievable.

01:13:15.136 --> 01:13:16.364
l`ll do it.

01:13:17.672 --> 01:13:19.162
Are you crazy?

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:23.242
No more shooting. No more guns.
No more guns. Put away the guns.

01:13:23.411 --> 01:13:25.572
This has got to be subtle.

01:13:25.746 --> 01:13:27.611
We`ll blow them up with the others.

01:13:27.782 --> 01:13:30.080

-You stay here, capture them.

01:13:30.251 --> 01:13:33.482
-l`ll go back and keep an eye on them.
-Be careful.

01:13:33.654 --> 01:13:36.214
You take the big one, l`ll take the other.

01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:38.688
Which one`s the big one?

01:13:42.063 --> 01:13:43.997

01:20:12.319 --> 01:20:13.911
Bend over.

01:20:15.889 --> 01:20:17.379
Just a flesh wound.

01:20:17.558 --> 01:20:19.321
Just-- Just graze me.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.286
Don`t worry.

01:20:24.431 --> 01:20:26.956
You won`t feel a thing.

01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:19.745
