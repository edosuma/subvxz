00:45.413 --> 00:47.112
Good morning, mom.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.814
Hi honey.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.249
Good morning.
Are the girls up?

00:50.351 --> 00:51.583
I heard them
moving around.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.454
I think I'm gonna
be home on Friday.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.524
Okay, we'll hold down
the fort until then.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.526
Smells good.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.493
Hi, pops.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.561
Pops?

01:03.898 --> 01:05.164
Hey.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.299
Hi, mom.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.501
Breakfast is almost ready
in about five seconds.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.602
You look nice, sweetie.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.871
Oh, this old thing?

01:12.973 --> 01:14.673
Oh, uh...

01:14.775 --> 01:16.208
The no-carb diet,
that's right.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.843
Yeah.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.211
Problem solved.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.512
Morning, pops.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.214
What is this
pops business?

01:22.316 --> 01:23.882
We thought you
needed a nickname.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.217
It makes me
sound old.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.652
Dad, you are old.

01:26.754 --> 01:27.519
I agree with them.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.354
Don't you
even say it.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.522
What?

01:33.394 --> 01:34.793
That better
not be a boy.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.029
No, it's Leslie.
We're working tonight.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.530
Are you working late?

01:38.632 --> 01:41.200
Yeah, we have a big bio test
to study for after our shift.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.869
I might stay over
if that's okay?

01:43.971 --> 01:45.204
Yeah, that's okay.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.872
Just make sure you text
me if you're going to.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.207
I have to go, honey.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.975
Bye, I'll
see you Friday.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.143
Bye dad, have a good trip.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.878
You ladies be
good for your mom.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.546
Bye dad.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.815
Oh! We actually gotta go.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.250
Yeah, I have
gym first period.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.987
Hey wait a minute,
lunches, lunches!

02:02.089 --> 02:03.021
Thanks!

02:03.124 --> 02:04.256
Okay.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.291
Drive safe Rachel,
don't speed!

02:07.595 --> 02:08.627
You're welcome.

02:11.832 --> 02:12.865
<i>And those are...</i>

02:12.967 --> 02:15.334
Eighty-five dollars.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.237
Just get lost, okay?

02:23.144 --> 02:25.177
All right,
there you go.

02:25.279 --> 02:25.844
Have a good day.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.246
<i>You too.</i>

02:29.550 --> 02:30.883
Hey.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.050
Was that Aaron?

02:32.153 --> 02:33.452
Yeah, what a creep.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.020
Anyways, you
ready to close?

02:35.122 --> 02:36.688
Are you kidding?
I'm not on commission.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.823
Let's get out of here.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.958
Go grab your stuff,
I'll get the lights.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.601
<i>Hi there, you've
reached Rachel Kent.</i>

02:49.703 --> 02:51.103
<i>Thanks for calling,
but you do know</i>

02:51.205 --> 02:52.905
<i>there's this thing
called texting, right?</i>

02:55.242 --> 02:57.543
Hey, did Rachel text
you last night?

02:57.645 --> 02:58.710
No.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.979
I know she has
that big test today.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.948
Yeah, I know.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.319
<i>Hi there, you've
reached Rachel Kent.</i>

03:07.421 --> 03:08.887
<i>Thanks for calling,
but you do know</i>

03:08.989 --> 03:10.389
<i>there's this thing
called texting, right?</i>

03:11.759 --> 03:12.791
Hey Rach.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.459
I didn't hear
from you last night.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.895
It's totally fine if you
need to study with Leslie,

03:16.997 --> 03:18.497
but you said that
you were gonna text me

03:18.599 --> 03:19.932
and I haven't heard from you.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.067
So give me a call, okay?

03:22.169 --> 03:23.569
Love you, bye.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.343
I'll get it!

03:32.680 --> 03:33.912
Hey.

03:34.014 --> 03:34.913
Dad!

03:35.015 --> 03:35.781
Hi!

03:35.883 --> 03:37.149
Morning sweetheart.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.650
When are you coming home?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.152
<i>Just a couple more days.</i>

03:40.254 --> 03:42.287
But hey, I was thinking
when I get back,

03:42.389 --> 03:45.624
maybe we can talk about
getting that puppy.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.359
Are you serious?

03:47.461 --> 03:49.828
Honey, how's
St. Louis?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.797
Ugh, horrible.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.933
There are definitely
no puppies here at all.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.670
Hey hon, did Rachel ever
text you this morning?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.339
No, why?

04:00.441 --> 04:04.710
She spent the night at Leslie's
and I never got a text from her.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.512
Well, she had that big
chemistry test or whatever.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.548
Biology, yeah.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.983
I'm sure she's fine.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.019
I think she's just trying
to find a new routine.

04:14.121 --> 04:18.055
It's gonna be confusing,
I think for all of us.

04:18.158 --> 04:21.692
Okay, well hon, we're
about to pull up to school,

04:21.795 --> 04:24.263
so we're gonna have
to say goodbye now.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.465
I love you both.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.707
Bye!

04:35.809 --> 04:37.542
Bye, mom!

04:40.748 --> 04:41.380
Angel?

04:41.482 --> 04:42.914
Yeah?

04:43.017 --> 04:44.483
Would you do me a favor and give
this to Rach if you see her?

04:44.585 --> 04:46.551
Mom, middle school kids don't
really hang out with the older--

04:46.654 --> 04:48.754
I know, but
would you please?

04:48.856 --> 04:50.222
If you see her.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.757
Okay, sure.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.860
But if you really want to get a
hold of her, you could just...

04:54.962 --> 04:57.229
What?

04:57.331 --> 04:59.097
Well, you did give
Rachel a phone,

04:59.199 --> 05:01.433
so you could just use
the find my phone app.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.003
That's brilliant!

05:05.105 --> 05:06.171
Why didn't I think of that?

05:06.273 --> 05:07.339
Yeah, okay.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.207
Just promise you'll
forget it once I'm 16.

05:09.310 --> 05:12.511
Of course...
I won't.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.079
Hey...

05:14.181 --> 05:16.581
I want that puppy!

05:59.893 --> 06:01.393
Umm, hi.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.061
It's Rachel's mom.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.664
I just want to--

06:08.502 --> 06:09.968
Rachel!

06:12.606 --> 06:13.972
Rachel!

06:15.109 --> 06:17.242
Rachel...

06:17.344 --> 06:18.443
Mom...

06:18.545 --> 06:19.578
I'm here.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.613
I'm here, okay?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.548
I'm here.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.251
Leslie...

07:00.053 --> 07:02.320
Mrs. Kent?

07:02.423 --> 07:04.055
I'm detective
Pam Cherfils.

07:04.158 --> 07:05.524
Oh, hi.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.859
You must be exhausted.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.127
Kind of, yeah.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.496
Please, let me
get you a coffee.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.431
Okay.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.406
<i>And she often works late?</i>

07:21.508 --> 07:25.710
Yeah, she works
after school, 5 to 9.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.078
She said she was going
to spend the night

07:27.181 --> 07:29.848
at a friend's house
after studying.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.317
How did I let
this happen?

07:32.419 --> 07:34.886
You did good finding
her so quickly.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.588
And what about
your husband?

07:36.690 --> 07:39.191
Did he know Rachel
was spending the night?

07:39.293 --> 07:42.360
Uh, Greg's
in St. Louis.

07:42.463 --> 07:46.731
He's a trial lawyer,
it's a lot of travel.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.435
Was it common for your daughter
to stay over at the Miles' home?

07:50.537 --> 07:52.871
No, not really.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.208
But nothing is
really common for us.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.276
What do you mean?

07:58.378 --> 07:59.845
Rachel's only lived
with us for three months,

07:59.947 --> 08:02.514
so we don't exactly
have a routine yet.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.949
So Rachel is--

08:04.051 --> 08:06.585
Rachel's my
stepdaughter.

08:06.687 --> 08:12.224
How did Rachel come
to live with you?

08:12.326 --> 08:18.563
Greg and Martha,
Rachel's biological mother,

08:18.665 --> 08:21.867
had a terrible breakup.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.069
Greg lost custody.

08:24.171 --> 08:30.509
He's very upset about it, he
doesn't like to talk about it.

08:30.611 --> 08:36.982
So we only saw Rachel
three or four times maybe.

08:37.083 --> 08:40.818
Then about a year ago,
Martha calls Greg.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.121
Apparently battling some
sort of drug addiction

08:43.222 --> 08:44.489
and asked for help.

08:44.591 --> 08:48.159
We assumed that it was
a play for more money.

08:48.262 --> 08:52.931
That's not uncommon.

08:53.033 --> 08:57.669
And then a few months later,
social services calls.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.504
Martha's gone.

08:59.606 --> 09:03.208
No note, no
explanation, nothing.

09:03.310 --> 09:07.979
She packed a bag while
Rachel was at school,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.515
and never came home.

09:10.617 --> 09:12.284
Can you imagine?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.152
That's horrible.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.989
We agreed to take
custody of course.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.293
And then this happens.

09:26.033 --> 09:31.002
We were just getting back
to some sort of normal.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.905
Poor girl.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.741
God, it's so unfair.

09:49.323 --> 09:53.158
<i>So you were closing up
and getting ready to leave.</i>

09:53.260 --> 09:55.760
And this was at 9pm?

09:55.862 --> 10:00.832
It might've been
more like 8:45.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.467
Sometimes we
would close up early

10:02.569 --> 10:04.302
so we can get a head
start on homework.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.204
But only if there was
no customers there.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.673
You're not gonna
tell Cheryl, are you?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.409
She's the manager
of the store.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.178
No, I won't tell her.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.647
So, you close early
to go do homework?

10:15.749 --> 10:19.551
Yeah, Leslie always
helped me with my homework.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.852
She was so smart.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.320
It's okay.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.389
Everything's
gonna be okay.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.058
I'm sure she
was a good friend.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.029
She was the best.

10:31.131 --> 10:35.567
Rachel, can you tell me
what happened to her?

10:37.137 --> 10:42.173
So, I went into the back room
to try and find my phone...

10:48.248 --> 10:51.783
Hey Leslie, have
you seen my phone?

10:54.388 --> 10:56.688
<i>One of them...</i>

10:56.790 --> 11:00.025
<i>he was holding
Leslie by the throat.</i>

11:00.127 --> 11:02.093
<i>Then the other guy, he
grabbed and slammed me</i>

11:02.195 --> 11:05.964
<i>on the ground and
he started choking me.</i>

11:06.066 --> 11:08.033
<i>Was he wearing gloves?</i>

11:08.135 --> 11:09.234
What?

11:09.336 --> 11:15.640
The assailant.
Was he wearing gloves?

11:15.742 --> 11:18.476
Uh, yeah.

11:18.578 --> 11:22.814
Yeah, he was. I remember
the smell of leather.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.382
And what about
the second attacker?

11:24.484 --> 11:27.285
Was he also
wearing gloves?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.087
<i>Yeah, but his
were different.</i>

11:29.189 --> 11:32.524
His were like big,
bulky ski gloves.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.995
<i>And then...</i>

11:39.366 --> 11:41.733
<i>Leslie, she
tried to save me</i>

11:41.835 --> 11:45.937
<i>and she jumped on
the back of my attacker.</i>

11:46.039 --> 11:48.807
<i>Then the other guy,
he hit her so hard.</i>

11:48.909 --> 11:52.577
<i>She just dropped.</i>

11:52.679 --> 11:54.279
<i>Then the first
guy came back</i>

11:54.381 --> 12:00.452
<i>and he started choking
me again, and then...</i>

12:00.554 --> 12:04.656
I kept thinking this is what it
must've been like for Martha.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.524
Your mother?

12:06.626 --> 12:08.893
Yeah.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.362
She said the drugs were
like someone choking her,

12:11.465 --> 12:13.898
like you couldn't
breathe without them.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.401
And that's when
you passed out?

12:16.503 --> 12:18.570
Yeah.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.839
Next thing I remember,
I woke up.

12:20.941 --> 12:24.576
<i>Tied up in the
back office.</i>

12:24.678 --> 12:26.511
<i>She was just lying there.</i>

12:26.613 --> 12:28.146
<i>I had to stare
at her for hours</i>

12:28.248 --> 12:30.915
<i>and there was nothing
I could do to help her.</i>

12:31.985 --> 12:34.219
Okay, that's
enough for today.

12:34.321 --> 12:37.222
Of course...
thank you.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.329
I just want you both to
know that I'm going to do

12:44.431 --> 12:47.365
everything in my power to
find the men who did this.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.901
Thank you, detective.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.884
Hey, come on, can we
get some space here?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.352
Come on, back up!

13:07.454 --> 13:09.154
How are you feeling?

13:11.525 --> 13:12.123
Please!

13:12.225 --> 13:13.525
Back up, please.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.560
<i>How did you
manage to survive?</i>

13:15.662 --> 13:17.128
<i>Can you describe the
experience, please?</i>

13:17.230 --> 13:18.463
Guys?

13:18.565 --> 13:21.399
Guys, please give us our
privacy right now, okay?

13:21.501 --> 13:22.734
Thank you.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.170
<i>We just have
one question!</i>

13:29.576 --> 13:31.743
How are you
feeling, honey?

13:31.845 --> 13:33.044
I don't know...

13:33.146 --> 13:35.046
that was crazy.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.081
People just want you to
know they're with you.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.551
They love you,
just like us.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.985
Sis!

13:41.087 --> 13:43.087
Hi!

13:43.190 --> 13:45.957
Oh, it feels so
good to be home.

13:46.059 --> 13:46.791
Did you miss me?

13:46.893 --> 13:47.892
Mmm-hmm!

14:10.951 --> 14:13.084
<i>I wasn't there...</i>

14:14.254 --> 14:16.020
Honey, this
isn't your fault.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.989
I've never
been there.

14:18.091 --> 14:18.957
No...

14:19.059 --> 14:21.059
Not once in 12 years.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.162
You lost custody.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.463
There was nothing
you could do.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.198
I could have
fought harder.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.968
I should have.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.204
She's my daughter
and I just...

14:33.306 --> 14:34.906
let her go.

14:37.177 --> 14:43.848
Then I finally get a chance
to do my job and she gets--

14:43.950 --> 14:47.285
You're here
for her now.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.254
We both are.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.623
<i>I'm just so sorry.</i>

15:27.260 --> 15:29.961
<i>Leslie was my best friend.</i>

15:30.063 --> 15:32.096
My only friend.

15:36.436 --> 15:41.306
I'm just--
I'm just so sorry.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.408
It should've been me.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.681
I miss her so much.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.951
Rach?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.053
Can I come in?

15:55.155 --> 15:57.422
Yeah, sorry.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.057
I just couldn't
sleep, you know?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.059
I understand.

16:06.232 --> 16:09.867
You of all people
did not deserve this.

16:09.970 --> 16:13.538
This feeling,
does it ever go away?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.106
Yes.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.344
I just feel so alone.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.713
You're not alone.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.682
Never again.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.785
You're part of this
family, like I am.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.956
Like Addy or
like your dad is.

16:32.058 --> 16:35.526
We're gonna work through
this, but together.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.695
Okay?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.263
You promise?

16:39.366 --> 16:42.100
I promise.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.369
Thanks, mom.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.575
Outside the Kent home,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.477
where the family will
give a statement

16:52.579 --> 16:56.180
on the attack of Rachel Kent
and the murder of Leslie Miles.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.483
The girls were attacked
while the--

16:58.585 --> 17:00.051
Here they come!

17:01.254 --> 17:03.588
Rachel, did you
recognize your attackers?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.189
Do the police
have any suspects?

17:05.290 --> 17:09.359
Look, we just want to put
this terrible tragedy behind us.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.128
Now my daughter would
like to say a few words.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.598
She won't be
taking any questions.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.141
I'm...

17:23.242 --> 17:26.810
I'm just so sorry.

17:26.913 --> 17:31.349
Leslie was my best
friend, my only friend.

17:31.451 --> 17:35.453
It should've been me.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.923
I just miss her so much.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.662
Come on.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.898
<i>Mr. Kent, one
more question!</i>

17:57.811 --> 17:58.810
Okay bye, girls.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.078
Your mom will be
here to pick you up.

18:00.180 --> 18:00.878
Bye!

18:00.980 --> 18:01.512
Bye guys.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.214
Have a good day.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.990
<i>I hope we're doing
the right thing.</i>

18:13.093 --> 18:17.562
She wants to move on,
that's a good thing.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.730
What's wrong?

18:19.833 --> 18:21.032
I don't know.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.835
Something about her in
front of all those cameras.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.738
All that attention.

18:27.841 --> 18:30.074
She's been
through the ringer.

18:30.176 --> 18:33.344
But everyone's
being so supportive.

18:33.446 --> 18:37.348
Maybe some positive attention
is exactly what she needs.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.019
Maybe you're right.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.458
It was so scary...

18:57.737 --> 18:58.736
Hey Addy!

18:58.838 --> 19:00.805
Come and join
us for a second.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.607
She'll tell you
all about it.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.709
It was so crazy.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.448
I was just telling
them about this morning.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.383
How many news stations
do you think were there?

19:12.485 --> 19:15.153
Umm, all of
them I think.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.287
That's crazy.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.122
So like, did they
ask you any questions?

19:18.224 --> 19:20.458
Yeah, they asked
me what it was like

19:20.560 --> 19:22.593
being attacked and
how I survived.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.728
Were you scared?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.697
Well yeah, I was face
to face with death.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.703
But, I had a family
to come home to.

19:32.805 --> 19:36.007
Somehow, I knew I was
gonna be all right.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.844
<i>Hey, how's it
going in there?</i>

19:39.946 --> 19:42.813
Well it's math,
so not great.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.749
If you need help,
let me know.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.152
It's fine, Rachel's
helping me with it.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.821
Did you see her
at school today?

19:50.924 --> 19:53.658
Sure.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.793
Did she seem okay?

19:55.895 --> 19:57.261
I think she was fine.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.298
She's like a total
celebrity now.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.933
What do you mean?

20:02.035 --> 20:05.603
Well, everybody wanted to
hear about what happened.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.471
Did she mind
talking about it?

20:07.574 --> 20:10.474
I don't think so.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.810
Actually, she
really got into it.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.512
She even invited me to
hang out with the seniors

20:14.614 --> 20:16.480
and talk about the press
thingy this morning.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.649
It was really cool.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.523
Reporting live for
CH News in Oregon.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.492
Outside the Kent home,
where the family will give--

20:28.595 --> 20:30.394
Special delivery!

20:30.496 --> 20:32.163
Mmm those smell good.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.131
Thank you!

20:36.736 --> 20:38.669
I thought you girls
were doing homework?

20:38.771 --> 20:39.904
We are.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.472
I just wanted to see if
there was any updates.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.909
Okay, after homework.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.844
<i>My daughter would
like to say a few words.</i>

20:46.946 --> 20:48.579
<i>She won't be
taking any questions.</i>

20:50.617 --> 20:52.917
I'm just so sorry...

20:53.019 --> 20:54.952
Do you think
I look pretty?

20:55.054 --> 20:57.555
Of course you do.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.328
Deiverls.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.863
Pam, please.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.531
I'm sorry to show
up like this.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.367
No, it's alright.
How can I help?

21:09.469 --> 21:12.503
I was hoping that I could
speak with Rachel again.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.772
I'd like to go over her
statement in a bit more detail.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.407
I'd rather you didn't.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.908
She's been through that
night multiple times.

21:18.011 --> 21:18.943
I know--

21:19.045 --> 21:19.877
We'd really like
to move past this.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.545
I understand, really.

21:21.648 --> 21:27.918
But Leslie's mom
deserves to move on too.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.687
Poor Tess.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.455
She lives
just down street.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.057
I just came from there.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.226
She's really struggling.

21:35.328 --> 21:38.929
It would help if we
could catch who did this.

21:39.032 --> 21:40.197
Yeah.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.266
Thank you.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.788
<i>Then it all went black.</i>

22:05.391 --> 22:10.061
The next thing I remember, I was
waking up in that back office.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.630
But they hit
Leslie first, right?

22:12.732 --> 22:15.299
They hit her and then the
second man started choking you.

22:15.401 --> 22:21.605
<i>Yeah, I saw her fall and--
and then he started choking me.</i>

22:21.708 --> 22:23.574
<i>It was so hard to breathe.</i>

22:23.676 --> 22:25.943
Oh god I m sorry,
it s all just such a blur.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.011
Okay, it's okay.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.979
I think that's enough.
Is that enough?

22:29.082 --> 22:31.916
Just a few more
questions, please.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.351
The man who hit Leslie.

22:33.453 --> 22:36.287
You said he was
maybe six feet tall.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.190
Could you see any discerning
marks, maybe a scar?

22:39.292 --> 22:39.990
No.

22:40.093 --> 22:40.858
Or a tattoo?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.226
No.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.527
Any kind of mark that
would help us identify him?

22:43.629 --> 22:44.795
No, I told you!

22:44.897 --> 22:46.430
He was tall, he
wore leather gloves,

22:46.532 --> 22:47.932
and he killed
my best friend!

22:48.034 --> 22:49.100
What more do you want?

22:49.202 --> 22:50.601
I think that's enough.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.970
I thought the man who choked you
was wearing leather gloves

22:53.072 --> 22:55.539
and Leslie's attacker was
wearing the ski gloves?

22:55.641 --> 22:57.208
Yeah, no, that's right.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.377
Okay, which man wore
the leather gloves?

22:59.479 --> 23:00.811
The man who choked
me! I just said--

23:00.913 --> 23:02.480
What's going on here?

23:02.582 --> 23:06.384
Mr. Kent, I was just asking
Rachel some follow up questions.

23:06.486 --> 23:09.353
It sounds like a damn
interrogation to me.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.789
I'm sorry, that
wa mte.

23:11.891 --> 23:15.292
Honey, you don't have
to say another word.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.395
And you...

23:17.497 --> 23:19.897
you can show yourself out.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.333
I'm sorry, thank
you for your time.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.635
Thank you, detective.

23:27.974 --> 23:31.208
Greg, that was
uncalled for.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.177
She's just trying
to do her job.

23:33.279 --> 23:35.413
You have no idea what
kind of bull the cops

23:35.515 --> 23:37.515
could pull on these
kinds of-- Bob?

23:37.617 --> 23:40.718
Yeah, it s Greg. I m
gonna need some counsel...

23:40.820 --> 23:42.920
You did great.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.423
Why did you do that?

23:45.525 --> 23:47.258
Why did I do what?

23:47.360 --> 23:49.260
Make me talk
to that woman.

23:49.362 --> 23:51.429
Why did you do that?

23:51.531 --> 23:53.597
I understand it's
really hard right now.

23:53.699 --> 23:57.334
But if you try, you might
remember some small things

23:57.437 --> 23:59.403
that'll help the police
catch who did this.

23:59.505 --> 24:00.871
No, you stupid bitch!

24:00.973 --> 24:03.808
You never should've
let me say anything!

24:32.138 --> 24:33.537
Lieutenant?

24:33.639 --> 24:35.806
Yeah, what's up?

24:35.908 --> 24:39.577
There is an incident report
here from 18 months ago.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.212
Leslie Miles pressed
charges against someone

24:41.314 --> 24:43.747
she claimed was
stalking her.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.749
Why don't we know
this already?

24:45.852 --> 24:47.551
The stalker was a
minor at the time.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.454
Everything's been expunged.

24:50.556 --> 24:51.155
Can I use your phone?

24:51.257 --> 24:53.257
Yeah.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.127
Yeah hi.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.663
No, it's Lieutenant Smith.

24:59.765 --> 25:03.033
I need you to put me through
to the DA's office, please.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.969
Yeah, thank you.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.904
We'll get a court order to
open this thing right away.

25:07.006 --> 25:07.771
Yeah.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.074
Good work.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.417
<i>You weren't there.</i>

25:20.520 --> 25:22.820
<i>You didn't see
how she acted.</i>

25:22.922 --> 25:26.223
She was in a
tough position.

25:26.325 --> 25:29.260
Are you saying
it was my fault?

25:29.362 --> 25:31.161
It's unfortunate.

25:31.264 --> 25:32.596
Rachel really shouldn't
be talking to the police

25:32.698 --> 25:34.331
without us discussing it.

25:34.433 --> 25:37.568
Okay I admit, the questioning
went on longer than I expected.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.170
But the detective was
just doing her job.

25:40.273 --> 25:44.575
Cindy, I'm telling you
this is how it happens.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.043
The police can't
solve a case,

25:46.145 --> 25:47.611
so they start throwing
the blame on the victim.

25:47.713 --> 25:48.879
Greg!

25:48.981 --> 25:50.347
She wasn't herself.

25:50.449 --> 25:54.018
She was angry!
Violently angry.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.519
She was lashing out.

25:55.621 --> 25:57.121
She's been through a
traumatic experience

25:57.223 --> 25:58.856
and now there's
a police woman

25:58.958 --> 26:00.858
that's trying to
blow holes in her story.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.627
It's not just this, it's
her behavior at school.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.363
Addy said she has
an entourage now.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.098
She's walking
around school

26:08.200 --> 26:09.900
telling everybody
about the murder.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.035
So?

26:11.137 --> 26:14.138
So she's acting
like a celebrity.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.773
She's a teenager.

26:15.875 --> 26:19.677
There's no right way to
deal with something like this.

26:19.779 --> 26:23.314
Okay well, I think we
should get her help.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.984
No.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.953
Greg, you said it yourself.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.555
She's been through a
traumatic experience.

26:31.657 --> 26:35.593
First with her
mom, and now this.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.561
No.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.233
Greg, she needs
a professional

26:43.336 --> 26:45.336
who can help her
with these issues.

26:45.438 --> 26:48.639
Rachel is going
to be fine.

26:48.741 --> 26:52.009
She needs her family
right now, not a shrink.

27:03.556 --> 27:05.689
Hey! Good news.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.024
Oh yeah?
What is it?

27:07.126 --> 27:09.660
Claret County just
picked up our stalker.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.495
19 year old male
named Aaron Barker.

27:11.597 --> 27:12.663
And guess what?

27:12.765 --> 27:14.465
He had ski gloves in
the trunk of his car.

27:14.567 --> 27:15.499
Come on, let's go!

27:15.601 --> 27:17.267
Okay!

27:23.209 --> 27:26.210
Things aren't looking
good for you, Aaron.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.948
I wasn't there, okay?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.516
I swear! I left.

27:32.618 --> 27:34.918
I left and I went home.

27:35.021 --> 27:39.023
And only your mother can
vouch for you, is that right?

27:40.893 --> 27:45.029
Does she know about
your restraining order?

27:45.131 --> 27:49.667
I got nothing else to say.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.803
Well, guess we'll
see about that.

27:52.905 --> 27:56.707
Maybe when we find your partner,
he'll be more talkative, huh?

28:03.282 --> 28:05.916
Mom as an alibi.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.885
We're so close.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.653
He was in the
store that day.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.588
We know that for sure.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.658
He's just not
what I expected.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.727
They never are.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.996
I don't know.
It's just--

28:19.098 --> 28:22.099
No prints, no DNA,
avoiding the cameras.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.702
It was so careful.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.904
He knew the girl, he knew the
place, he knew the lay out.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.672
It makes sense.

28:28.774 --> 28:32.009
Yeah, but the crime
is the opposite.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.610
Using the register
as a weapon.

28:33.713 --> 28:37.414
It just-- it feels
so spur of the moment.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.383
Maybe him and his
buddy went in there

28:39.485 --> 28:40.784
expecting to
confront Leslie.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.619
He didn't realize she
has a friend with her,

28:42.722 --> 28:43.721
panicked,
attacked them both.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.690
Then used the
robbery as a cover.

28:46.792 --> 28:47.391
Yeah, but--

28:47.493 --> 28:50.427
But what?

28:50.529 --> 28:53.464
The physical evidence
at the scene

28:53.566 --> 28:55.766
isn't corresponding with the
statement from the victim.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.469
The M.E. said that Leslie
was hit from the front,

28:58.571 --> 29:00.871
not from behind like
the Kent girl s statement.

29:00.973 --> 29:04.975
Yeah well, sometimes victim s
statements can be confused,

29:05.077 --> 29:06.777
especially when they're young.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.913
I know but when I
re-interviewed Rachel,

29:10.015 --> 29:12.483
her story was all
over the map.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.620
And there's
something else.

29:16.722 --> 29:20.758
Rachel's injuries are basically
superficial, cuts and bruises.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.894
Any of it could have
been self-inflicted.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.463
What about the choking?

29:28.234 --> 29:30.467
Look at the bruise pattern.

29:30.569 --> 29:31.568
When you choke someone,

29:31.670 --> 29:33.904
your thumbs line up
next to each other.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.606
When you choke yourself
your thumbs are apart,

29:35.708 --> 29:37.541
and your hands cross over.

29:37.643 --> 29:42.780
And her bruise pattern is
reflective of self-asphyxiation.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.848
So you're telling me
that this little thing

29:44.950 --> 29:46.283
killed her best friend,
then tied herself up,

29:46.385 --> 29:48.118
lay on the floor all night
waiting for someone

29:48.220 --> 29:51.255
to open that door
and find her?

29:51.357 --> 29:55.526
Nah. My money s
on the stalker.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.928
But if his alibi holds up...

29:58.030 --> 30:01.398
Keep pushing this victim
killer angle, just in case.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.535
But you t tread care.

30:04.637 --> 30:08.138
Because if you're wrong,
Rachel's the victim.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.251
Oh it's gonna fall!
It's gonna fall!

30:33.766 --> 30:36.099
I'm so stuck.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.170
A puppy!

30:40.272 --> 30:42.539
Oh my god.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.742
Happy Saturday.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.281
Where did he come from?
What's his name?

30:51.383 --> 30:52.549
His name is Ted.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.786
And he's a rescue.
He's been through a whole lot.

30:56.822 --> 30:59.523
He just needs a
lot of love now.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.024
Can we take him
out to play?

31:01.126 --> 31:02.459
I'm sure your mom
would love that,

31:02.561 --> 31:04.127
as long as you
take him outside.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.729
Come on Ted,
let's go outside!

31:05.831 --> 31:08.532
Good one, honey.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.303
Oh, he's going to
tear up the house.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.806
I'm sorry about
last night.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.675
I messed up.

31:18.777 --> 31:22.179
There's a stigma that starts
when you see a psychiatrist

31:22.281 --> 31:26.550
and I just-- I don't
want that for Rachel.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.485
I understand.

31:29.622 --> 31:31.321
Thank you.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.092
Everything's
going to be alright.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.894
I know.

31:38.530 --> 31:42.332
You're gonna help
with the dog, right?

31:42.434 --> 31:42.933
Right?

31:43.035 --> 31:44.501
Yes, yes.

32:24.877 --> 32:25.909
Hi, Tess.

32:26.011 --> 32:27.744
Hi.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.981
Can I come in?

32:32.217 --> 32:35.018
I'll get a bowl of
water for your dog.

32:44.763 --> 32:47.831
I'm so sorry.

32:47.933 --> 32:51.268
Is there anything
I can do?

32:51.370 --> 32:54.071
No, there's nothing.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.673
Anything, please?

32:59.979 --> 33:02.679
You could come
to the funeral.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.348
Leslie would like that.

33:04.450 --> 33:12.155
Of course,
we'll be there.

33:12.257 --> 33:17.160
Hey, I saw that
detective was here.

33:17.262 --> 33:18.795
Pam.

33:20.966 --> 33:22.265
Yeah.

33:23.402 --> 33:27.504
Was she here for
anything in particular?

33:27.606 --> 33:31.341
She was asking
about my Leslie...

33:31.443 --> 33:33.677
And your Rachel.

33:33.779 --> 33:37.014
I didn't want to say
anything before...

33:37.116 --> 33:41.685
Say anything? What?

33:41.787 --> 33:46.356
I didn't want anybody to
think badly of my Leslie.

33:46.458 --> 33:50.527
But that detective
was so insistent.

33:50.629 --> 33:54.398
Tess, what
did you say?

33:54.500 --> 33:57.200
The girls.

33:57.302 --> 34:00.704
They were stealing
from that store.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.072
What?

34:02.174 --> 34:06.576
Clothes, bags, shoes.

34:06.678 --> 34:10.614
Leslie was afraid that they
were gonna get them fired.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.583
Rachel was very careful.

34:13.685 --> 34:18.121
She told Leslie
to stop fretting.

34:18.223 --> 34:22.059
And I was telling
Leslie to stop.

34:22.161 --> 34:25.896
To promise me
she would.

34:25.998 --> 34:31.201
The detective wanted
to know all about that.

34:31.303 --> 34:35.972
She asked me if Les
and Rachel ever fought.

34:38.077 --> 34:39.842
Such nonsense.

34:39.945 --> 34:43.112
What teenage girls
don't fight?

34:46.485 --> 34:50.454
Honey, I thought you
knew about the fight?

34:52.190 --> 34:54.157
How would I know?

34:55.661 --> 34:58.161
Wasn't Rachel
upset after?

35:11.009 --> 35:12.742
Okay, bye.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.348
Greg, you were
right about the police.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.217
I just talked to Tess, there's
something you should know.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.519
Call me.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.819
Mom?

35:55.921 --> 35:57.387
Addy, go to your room.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.221
What's happening?

35:58.323 --> 35:59.623
Go, now!

35:59.725 --> 36:00.724
How could you do this?

36:00.826 --> 36:01.791
I'm sorry.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.126
It just started
with some clothes.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.794
And then nobody said anything,
so we took some shoes.

36:04.897 --> 36:05.962
And then-- I'm sorry.

36:06.064 --> 36:07.297
Do you have any idea
what this looks like?

36:07.399 --> 36:08.899
I know!

36:13.405 --> 36:14.471
Oh my god, mom, please.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.640
Please don't make
them take me away.

36:16.742 --> 36:17.407
Stay here.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.008
Please, I don't want to--

36:18.110 --> 36:19.709
Quiet!

36:27.853 --> 36:30.353
Mrs. Kent, we're here
to search the premises.

36:30.455 --> 36:31.521
Absolutely not.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.089
We have a search warrant.
Please step aside.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.591
No.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.660
Mrs. Kent!

36:36.762 --> 36:38.962
Let me see it.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.901
Is there anyone
else in the home?

36:45.003 --> 36:46.670
My daughters.

36:46.772 --> 36:49.206
Come on guys.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.174
Detective...

36:51.276 --> 36:52.509
detective!

36:53.812 --> 36:55.445
<i>Rachel Kent,
you are under arrest.</i>

36:55.547 --> 36:57.080
No, no, please! Mom!

36:57.182 --> 36:58.415
Mom, what's going on?

36:58.517 --> 37:00.617
Pam, you have
the wrong person!

37:00.719 --> 37:02.018
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.720
Anything you say
can and will be used

37:03.822 --> 37:05.255
against you in
a court of law.

37:05.357 --> 37:08.758
Pam, please, stop this.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.928
Do you have receipts
for those items?

37:12.030 --> 37:13.730
I don't have
a choice here.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.332
I'm sorry.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.405
Please mom, please!

37:22.507 --> 37:23.607
Don't let them
take me away!

37:23.709 --> 37:26.543
Pam, you have
the wrong person!

37:26.645 --> 37:28.144
Rachel! I'm gonna
be right behind you.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.546
Don't say
anything to anybody.

37:29.648 --> 37:30.814
Mom, please!

37:30.916 --> 37:32.082
I thought you loved me?

37:32.184 --> 37:33.717
Don't let them take me away!

37:33.819 --> 37:35.752
Pam, she didn't
do anything!

37:35.854 --> 37:37.621
Mom!

37:47.766 --> 37:49.466
<i>Oh you're damn
right I'm gonna sue.</i>

37:49.568 --> 37:51.301
I'm gonna burn that whole
department to the ground.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.435
If they want to
pull this crap,

37:52.537 --> 37:54.971
then there's gonna
be consequences.

37:58.243 --> 38:01.144
Listen, we'll talk
more in the morning.

38:01.246 --> 38:04.180
Okay, bye.

38:07.386 --> 38:10.754
Everything's
gonna be fine.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.522
You were right.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.626
They were out to get
her and I let them.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.229
We'll get her back.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.299
This isn't gonna stick.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.667
The police are
grasping at straws.

38:23.769 --> 38:27.604
All they have is $3000
worth of clothing.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.773
It's no big deal.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.275
Greg, she did
steal those things.

38:36.248 --> 38:38.181
No she didn't.

38:40.252 --> 38:43.586
Yes she did.
She told me.

38:43.689 --> 38:46.289
No... she didn't.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.461
Greg, we can't lie.

39:02.441 --> 39:06.876
I'm not gonna let my
daughter get hurt.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.145
Not this time.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.557
Your friends at
school said that

39:20.659 --> 39:23.059
they saw you and
Leslie fighting.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.028
One witness said she
saw you slap her

39:25.130 --> 39:28.264
across the face in
the school parking lot.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.766
My parents say I'm not
allowed to talk to you

39:29.868 --> 39:34.003
without my
lawyers present.

39:34.106 --> 39:37.173
Perhaps you would like to
explain why your shoe print

39:37.275 --> 39:40.377
was found in the victim's blood
when, by your own account,

39:40.479 --> 39:43.413
you were passed out on
the floor at the time?

39:44.282 --> 39:45.615
Detective?

39:55.026 --> 39:57.060
We're done.
She's lawyered up.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.862
She won't say a word.

39:58.964 --> 40:01.564
Dad has her trained up.

40:01.666 --> 40:04.467
You put us in a real
bind here, detective.

40:07.973 --> 40:11.307
...and a role model to
our youngest daughter.

40:11.410 --> 40:14.177
Our daughter is the victim
of this terrible crime,

40:14.279 --> 40:15.979
not its perpetrator.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.781
We look forward to
the immediate release

40:17.883 --> 40:20.283
of our daughter and a
formal police apology.

40:20.385 --> 40:21.985
What did I tell you?

40:22.087 --> 40:23.686
I told you to handle
this carefully.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.855
You were there to serve a
warrant, not make an arrest.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.691
There was a mountain
of evidence.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.794
More than enough to merit
an arrest for larceny.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.362
And with Tess
Miles' statement,

40:32.464 --> 40:35.131
we have prior incidents
of conflict between the girls,

40:35.233 --> 40:36.966
which is motive
for the murder.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.669
Did you know that woman
was under a half dozen

40:39.771 --> 40:42.338
anti-depressants at the
time you spoke to her?

40:42.441 --> 40:43.540
She was a
little slow, yeah.

40:43.642 --> 40:44.974
A little slow?

40:45.076 --> 40:47.343
Cindy Kent says she
was practically a zombie.

40:47.446 --> 40:48.545
You spoke to Cindy?

40:48.647 --> 40:49.846
Her and her husband.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.414
And she also told me
you had no lawyer present

40:51.516 --> 40:52.982
when you re-interviewed
her daughter.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.418
I thought she was a
victim at the time.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.187
Well, her husband
has filed a petition

40:57.289 --> 40:58.988
to throw out your
interview with Rachel

40:59.090 --> 41:01.257
and the statement
from Leslie's mother.

41:01.359 --> 41:03.226
We haven't even charged
her with the murder yet.

41:03.328 --> 41:06.596
And we're not going to.

41:06.698 --> 41:09.265
We're letting her go.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.701
Okay, what about all
the stolen property?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.436
Gregory Kent says they
bought all those clothes.

41:13.538 --> 41:14.671
Oh, come on!

41:14.773 --> 41:17.407
Can you prove
she stole them?

41:17.509 --> 41:19.843
We're charging Aaron
Barker with the murder.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.244
He has an alibi.

41:21.346 --> 41:22.712
And you said
that it was solid.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.782
Nobody wants this to continue,
do you understand me?

41:25.884 --> 41:27.717
The stalker did it,
and that's that.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.819
Now go home.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.322
And stay away
from the cameras.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.566
I'm sorry about all the
questions, Miss Kent.

41:43.668 --> 41:47.670
I just have one more and then
you can go home, all right?

41:49.608 --> 41:52.976
Do you recognize
any of these men?

42:10.729 --> 42:12.428
Him.

42:12.531 --> 42:14.397
He was at the
store that day.

42:14.499 --> 42:15.899
And what did he do?

42:16.001 --> 42:17.400
He attacked me.

42:17.502 --> 42:20.970
He was the one!
He killed Leslie.

42:21.072 --> 42:22.639
Okay Miss Kent,
thank you very much.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.240
You can go.

42:33.051 --> 42:37.854
Mrs. Kent, your daughter
is being released.

42:37.956 --> 42:39.689
No thanks to you.

42:39.791 --> 42:41.624
The Lieutenant told
me that your husband

42:41.726 --> 42:44.260
purchased those items from
your daughter's store?

42:44.362 --> 42:47.697
Tell me, did you buy
Rachel some of those things?

42:47.799 --> 42:48.431
Umm, I'm--

42:48.533 --> 42:50.967
Mom!

42:51.069 --> 42:52.702
Hi honey.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.037
Your dad's
waiting by the car,

42:54.139 --> 42:55.672
so go ahead and I'll be
there in a few minutes.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.574
Okay.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.612
Your daughter has
been through a lot.

43:02.714 --> 43:05.181
I guess she deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

43:05.283 --> 43:06.883
She does.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.719
The Lieutenant
told us that a man

43:09.821 --> 43:11.554
was arrested for
Leslie's murder?

43:11.656 --> 43:12.889
A boy.

43:12.991 --> 43:16.693
A 19 year old who had an
infatuation with Leslie.

43:18.430 --> 43:19.829
Did he do it?

43:19.931 --> 43:21.230
It's possible.

43:21.333 --> 43:23.066
It's also possible
that your daughter

43:23.168 --> 43:25.168
knew about
Leslie s stalker.

43:25.270 --> 43:28.871
They would've talked about that
kind of thing, wouldn't they?

43:32.677 --> 43:35.144
You should just be careful.

43:35.246 --> 43:39.415
She's only been living with
you for three months, right?

43:41.953 --> 43:44.220
If you'll excuse me.

43:54.099 --> 43:56.065
<i>Daddy!</i>

43:56.167 --> 43:57.600
<i>Rachel!</i>

44:08.647 --> 44:11.247
You're so cute!
Awww!

44:12.817 --> 44:14.784
Welcome home!

44:17.122 --> 44:19.088
Hi!

44:19.190 --> 44:21.758
Come here, come say hi!

44:24.496 --> 44:26.896
Oh you guys, I don't
ever want to leave.

44:26.998 --> 44:29.298
You won't have to.

44:31.102 --> 44:33.436
Here, I got your
favorite cheese pizza.

44:33.538 --> 44:35.471
Oh, so good!

44:45.283 --> 44:48.851
It feels good to have
everyone under one roof again.

44:48.953 --> 44:50.486
Yeah.

44:54.259 --> 44:56.693
Honey, you understand...

44:56.795 --> 44:58.761
we had to lie.

45:01.266 --> 45:04.333
We had to fight fire with fire.
We had to get her out of there.

45:04.436 --> 45:06.602
Well...

45:06.705 --> 45:09.372
we didn't have a choice.

45:09.474 --> 45:11.174
That's right.

45:11.276 --> 45:13.543
But we do have a
choice about how

45:13.645 --> 45:16.012
we parent her
from here on out.

45:16.114 --> 45:18.081
What do you mean?

45:18.183 --> 45:22.085
We need to talk to Rachel
about what happened.

45:22.187 --> 45:24.454
I knew it.

45:24.556 --> 45:26.823
I knew the otherewould drop at.

45:26.925 --> 45:28.091
Can't we just
get past this?

45:28.193 --> 45:31.094
I lied for you.
And I lied for her.

45:31.196 --> 45:32.328
We're still her parents.

45:32.430 --> 45:33.196
Cindy!

45:33.298 --> 45:35.098
Greg, she was stealing!

45:35.200 --> 45:36.766
The police would
say anything to--

45:36.868 --> 45:39.469
We barely know
anything about her.

45:39.571 --> 45:40.970
Or what she's
been through.

45:41.072 --> 45:42.672
So I made my decision.

45:42.774 --> 45:44.807
She needs professional help and
she's going to see a specialist.

45:44.909 --> 45:45.942
Cindy--

45:46.044 --> 45:47.944
No! This is no longer
up for discussion.

45:48.046 --> 45:49.512
Fine.

45:50.148 --> 45:52.115
Mom... dad.

45:54.552 --> 45:57.186
Sweetie, you
should be asleep.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.122
I know, I...

45:59.224 --> 46:01.758
I just want to apologize.

46:07.766 --> 46:09.532
I never should have
taken those things.

46:09.634 --> 46:13.202
And I really shouldn't
have lied about it.

46:13.304 --> 46:16.005
I'm so sorry.

46:16.107 --> 46:18.407
chwere you
fighting with Leslie?

46:18.510 --> 46:19.509
Hun--

46:19.611 --> 46:21.010
Greg, this is important.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.578
I don't think this
is the right time--

46:22.680 --> 46:23.279
Please!

46:23.381 --> 46:24.947
Dad, it's okay.

46:27.986 --> 46:30.386
I was so stupid.

46:30.488 --> 46:31.687
We did fight.

46:31.790 --> 46:35.892
Leslie wanted to stop
stealing and I said no.

46:35.994 --> 46:38.594
Maybe if I had just
listened to her,

46:38.696 --> 46:40.863
maybe we would have
gotten out of the store

46:40.965 --> 46:46.402
before those men came and
maybe she wouldn't have--

46:46.504 --> 46:48.671
Come here, sweetie.

46:50.375 --> 46:52.909
You know if you needed clothes,
we would've bought them for you.

46:53.011 --> 46:54.110
Why steal them?

46:54.212 --> 46:56.412
I don't know!

46:56.514 --> 46:59.382
I thought maybe
if I looked pretty

46:59.484 --> 47:01.717
and I didn't
ask for much,

47:01.820 --> 47:04.554
that you guys
would let me stay.

47:04.656 --> 47:08.758
Oh, Rachel...

47:08.860 --> 47:12.161
I just didn't want you
to leave like mom did.

47:13.364 --> 47:18.134
We would never,
ever leave you.

47:18.236 --> 47:21.938
You're my little girl and
you're part of this family

47:22.040 --> 47:25.174
and you always will be,
no matter what.

47:25.276 --> 47:27.210
You promise?

47:28.646 --> 47:30.179
I promise.

47:34.185 --> 47:36.519
Of course...
I promise.

47:45.964 --> 47:46.729
Morning.

47:46.831 --> 47:49.198
Good morning.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.032
You want some coffee?

47:50.134 --> 47:51.834
Yes, please.

47:56.608 --> 47:57.807
Thank you.

48:05.683 --> 48:08.584
It's Leslie's
funeral today.

48:08.686 --> 48:10.186
Hmm...

48:13.691 --> 48:16.359
Addy can go to school,

48:16.461 --> 48:20.196
but I'd like
Rachel and I to go.

48:20.298 --> 48:23.633
Is that really necessary?

48:23.735 --> 48:25.735
Yeah.

48:25.837 --> 48:30.840
Plus it would give Rachel and
me some mother daughter time.

48:33.311 --> 48:34.911
I'll take Addy then.

48:35.013 --> 48:36.812
Thank you.

48:39.117 --> 48:41.317
I'll tell the girls.

48:46.224 --> 48:48.291
I have another
one to show you.

48:48.393 --> 48:50.259
What about this?
Do you like this?

48:50.361 --> 48:51.961
Are you serious?

48:52.063 --> 48:52.995
It's gorge.

48:53.097 --> 48:55.765
It is pretty nice.

48:55.867 --> 48:58.134
I don't have
anything like this.

48:58.236 --> 48:59.936
You know you could.

49:00.038 --> 49:02.805
You just need to
know how to ask.

49:02.907 --> 49:04.173
It is nice, hey?

49:04.275 --> 49:07.810
It is really nice.

49:07.912 --> 49:09.512
Good morning girls.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.681
Today is a really
important day.

49:11.783 --> 49:15.251
Rachel, please
don't be late.

49:15.353 --> 49:17.219
Okay.

49:18.523 --> 49:21.757
Guess I better
get ready to go.

49:25.430 --> 49:28.230
Rachel, come on.

49:28.333 --> 49:31.067
I told you
not to be late!

49:32.904 --> 49:34.870
What is that?

49:34.973 --> 49:37.306
What? Don't you like it?

49:37.408 --> 49:39.275
Honey, you know you
can't go like that.

49:39.377 --> 49:39.875
Please go change.

49:39.978 --> 49:41.177
You know what?

49:41.279 --> 49:42.878
I was thinking I really
can't go to this funeral.

49:42.981 --> 49:44.947
Can you drop me off
at school instead?

49:45.049 --> 49:46.115
No, you're going.

49:46.217 --> 49:47.383
Dad said I
didn't have to.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.518
He did not. Go change.

49:49.620 --> 49:52.555
Mom, I can't.

49:52.657 --> 49:54.890
I don't want to see all
those people there,

49:54.993 --> 49:56.292
crying about Leslie.

49:56.394 --> 49:57.693
It's just too hard.

49:57.795 --> 50:00.296
This is part of the
grieving process.

50:00.398 --> 50:01.998
Well I don't care.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.200
Rachel, you need to go!

50:04.302 --> 50:05.501
People will expect it.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.069
Well they didn't
have to lie next

50:07.171 --> 50:08.871
to Leslie's dead
body all night!

50:08.973 --> 50:10.406
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to tough it out.

50:10.508 --> 50:11.874
Mom, I can't!

50:11.976 --> 50:12.675
Yes, you can.

50:12.777 --> 50:14.577
No I won't go,
you bitch!

51:13.538 --> 51:14.570
Addy!

51:15.606 --> 51:16.739
Addy?

51:21.646 --> 51:23.379
What happened?

51:23.481 --> 51:26.115
We found him
on the street.

51:26.217 --> 51:29.351
Someone must
have hit him.

51:29.454 --> 51:32.021
I'm so sorry, Addy.

51:32.123 --> 51:34.890
He was such a good dog.

51:34.992 --> 51:37.993
I know how much
you loved him.

51:40.832 --> 51:43.566
Must have been
a hit and run.

51:43.668 --> 51:46.135
I thought I tied him up.

51:46.237 --> 51:47.436
This is
horrible, honey.

51:47.538 --> 51:49.605
I'm so sorry.

51:49.707 --> 51:53.275
Addy and I came home from
school and there he was,

51:53.377 --> 51:57.546
just lying there in the road,
right in front of the house.

51:57.648 --> 52:01.550
A-hole didn't even move
him out of the street.

52:06.757 --> 52:08.657
Teddy I miss you.

52:09.994 --> 52:12.228
He loved you too.

52:13.831 --> 52:17.533
Let's just thank god it
wasn't you who got hurt.

52:31.682 --> 52:33.149
It's gonna be okay.

52:35.419 --> 52:37.887
We need to have a talk.

52:39.657 --> 52:40.990
It s gonna be okay.

53:04.115 --> 53:06.949
I'm very sorry.

53:07.051 --> 53:11.020
We'll get her a new dog,
we can take her to the--

53:12.356 --> 53:17.193
Where was Rachel when
you and Addy found Ted?

53:17.295 --> 53:19.061
What?

53:19.163 --> 53:21.797
Was she here?

53:21.899 --> 53:25.000
She was with
friends, why?

53:25.102 --> 53:28.003
I think she
killed the dog.

53:28.105 --> 53:30.839
She did, Greg.

53:30.942 --> 53:33.742
And it was a
warning meant for me.

53:33.844 --> 53:34.810
Cindy...

53:34.912 --> 53:35.878
Look at this.

53:35.980 --> 53:37.646
Look nice and close at this.

53:37.748 --> 53:39.148
Do you see that?

53:39.250 --> 53:42.384
She did that when I tried to
make her go to the funeral.

53:42.486 --> 53:44.853
She told me.

53:48.859 --> 53:49.925
And...?

53:50.027 --> 53:51.694
I told her it was
totally unacceptable

53:51.796 --> 53:54.730
and I grounded
her for a month.

53:54.832 --> 53:56.398
That's it?

53:56.500 --> 53:58.100
What am I
supposed to do?

53:58.202 --> 54:00.869
She told me that you grabbed her
and told her to tough it out.

54:00.972 --> 54:03.005
Greg, she hit me.

54:03.107 --> 54:05.407
I'm not saying that
hitting you is right Cindy,

54:05.509 --> 54:07.843
but she's just a child.

54:07.945 --> 54:09.979
She's a child who's been
through more than you and I

54:10.081 --> 54:15.317
can possibly imagine
and she was scared.

54:15.419 --> 54:19.121
But this whole business
about the dog...

54:20.391 --> 54:21.557
Yeah.

54:21.659 --> 54:24.526
I think she hit him
when you were gone.

54:24.629 --> 54:27.029
She didn't murder
the damn dog!

54:27.131 --> 54:29.231
You don't know her, Greg!

54:29.333 --> 54:30.266
Stop it.

54:30.368 --> 54:32.868
We don't know
what she's done.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.403
Leslie was just murdered.

54:34.505 --> 54:35.871
And they found the guy.
That is over.

54:35.973 --> 54:39.108
No, I'm telling right
you, she's very dangerous.

54:39.210 --> 54:41.410
And she could hurt
Addy or one of us.

54:41.512 --> 54:47.049
I love you but... don't
make me choose between...

54:50.421 --> 54:52.154
I love Rachel too.

54:52.256 --> 54:56.592
But she's lived
here three months.

54:56.694 --> 55:00.396
How many times have you
seen her in the past 15 years?

55:00.498 --> 55:02.064
Five?

55:02.166 --> 55:04.400
Six times?

55:04.502 --> 55:07.069
We barely know her.

55:07.171 --> 55:10.239
She could be seriously
damaged in ways

55:10.341 --> 55:13.375
that we don't even
understand yet.

55:16.914 --> 55:19.882
That's my baby
girl up there.

55:26.590 --> 55:29.925
I have to go down to
Newport for a few days.

55:31.562 --> 55:35.164
When I get back, maybe
we can call a counsellor.

56:27.251 --> 56:28.150
You like that?

56:28.252 --> 56:29.651
Yeah.

56:29.754 --> 56:30.853
Good morning.

56:30.955 --> 56:32.488
Morning, dad!

56:32.590 --> 56:33.689
Want some OJ?

56:33.791 --> 56:35.791
Thank you.

56:41.766 --> 56:43.499
Alright, I'm off.

56:43.601 --> 56:45.100
Bye dad.
Have a good trip.

56:45.202 --> 56:46.068
Bye.

56:46.170 --> 56:47.035
Love you both.

56:47.138 --> 56:48.404
Love you too.

56:48.506 --> 56:51.473
Be good.
Umm, my phone...

56:51.575 --> 56:54.009
Oh, I think I saw it
in the dining room.

57:24.675 --> 57:27.142
You forgot this...

57:32.149 --> 57:33.916
Looks like you
found all the best

57:34.018 --> 57:37.986
divorce lawyers in the
state, congratulations.

57:38.088 --> 57:41.290
That's not mine, I
didn't look that up.

57:41.392 --> 57:45.461
We've been married for 15
years and this is what I get?

57:45.563 --> 57:50.299
We had one fight and
you want to cut and run?

57:50.401 --> 57:52.601
I didn't search for that,
Rachel must've done that!

57:52.703 --> 57:54.937
Oh for god's sake, you're
blaming this on her too?

57:55.039 --> 57:56.805
Well, why would
I do that?

57:56.907 --> 58:00.242
Girls, go back to
the other room!

58:03.347 --> 58:04.513
Why don't you
believe me?

58:04.615 --> 58:05.647
I didn't do this.

58:05.749 --> 58:07.082
I can't do
this right now.

58:07.184 --> 58:09.885
We need to talk
about this now!

58:13.958 --> 58:14.990
It's okay.

58:15.092 --> 58:17.526
Here, why don't you
try and eat something?

58:19.230 --> 58:22.297
You have something
you want to tell me?

58:22.399 --> 58:23.799
Come on, Addy.

58:23.901 --> 58:25.334
We better go, we're going
to be late for school.

58:25.436 --> 58:27.669
No, I'm taking her!

58:27.771 --> 58:28.837
Mom?

58:28.939 --> 58:30.772
Addy, you're going
with me today.

58:30.875 --> 58:32.107
Grab your bag.

58:32.209 --> 58:33.475
Okay.

58:33.577 --> 58:34.576
See you guys later.

58:34.678 --> 58:35.878
Bye, sis.

58:54.999 --> 58:55.964
Addy...

58:56.066 --> 58:57.366
Yeah?

58:57.468 --> 59:00.002
You wait for me to
pick you up, understand?

59:00.104 --> 59:01.637
Only me.

59:01.739 --> 59:02.971
Why, what's wrong?

59:03.073 --> 59:04.806
I don't want you driving
home alone with Rachel.

59:04.909 --> 59:05.674
I don't get it.

59:05.776 --> 59:08.010
Just do as I say!

59:08.112 --> 59:10.112
I'm sorry.

59:12.349 --> 59:15.484
I need you to
be safe, okay?

59:15.586 --> 59:17.920
Please just
do as a I ask.

59:18.022 --> 59:19.021
All right?

59:19.123 --> 59:20.355
Okay.

59:20.457 --> 59:23.191
Thank you, I love you.

59:23.294 --> 59:27.162
I'm gonna pick you
up here after soccer.

59:27.264 --> 59:30.232
Okay, I love you too.

59:50.321 --> 59:53.355
Detective Cherfils,
could I have a moment?

59:53.457 --> 59:56.158
Mrs. Kent, I
have a briefing.

59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.395
Pam, please.

01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:02.097
Go ahead.

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:16.812
How is the case going against
that boy, Aaron Barker?

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:19.815
The DA is moving
towards a prosecution.

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:22.050
There's very little
physical evidence,

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:23.785
and Barker has
a solid alibi,

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:27.389
but of course,
we have a witness.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:35.397
Our dog was
killed yesterday.

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.332
Okay.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.374
I think Rachel did it.

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:51.513
And what about those
cuts on your neck?

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.852
They're from yesterday
when I tried

01:00:56.954 --> 01:01:00.155
to make her go to
Leslie's funeral.

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:03.258
You can press
charges if you want.

01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:08.263
That's not enough.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:11.166
What do you
want from me?

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.402
I want her out
of my house.

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:18.607
Cindy, there's
not much I can do.

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:25.347
Greg and I lied.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:27.449
We didn't buy
her those things.

01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:29.551
She stole them all.

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:31.353
I know.

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:35.724
But you need to understand,
there's no turning back.

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:38.627
The department, along with the
newspapers and the whole city

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:41.463
have concluded that
Rachel is innocent.

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:44.433
We've charged someone
else with Leslie's murder.

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:48.136
Some scratches and a dead
puppy aren't gonna change that.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.875
Look...

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:56.478
Bring me something new,
something concrete,

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.613
and I will look into it.

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:04.286
Okay, thank you.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:09.758
And Cindy, call me
if anything happens.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.526
I'll help keep an eye
out for you and Addy

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:14.830
until we get
this worked out.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:16.898
Thank you.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:41.323
<i>Hello?</i>

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:45.327
Hi, I'm calling from the law
offices of Gersh and Hatzenberg.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.562
We're serving a summons
against a former resident

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:50.332
of your apartment
complex, Martha Cook.

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:52.868
She left quite a
few unpaid bills

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.403
and we're just trying to
get a forwarding address.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:57.105
<i>Let me check.</i>

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:06.014
Okay.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.083
Thank you
very much, bye.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:29.337
<i>Hello Crestview Motel,
how may I help you?</i>

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:32.541
Hi, could you put me through
to Martha Cook's room, please?

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:34.376
<i>Martha's on a
shift right now.</i>

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.344
<i>I can have her call
you back on her break.</i>

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:37.512
<i>Could I take a message?</i>

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:39.014
Oh.

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:42.384
Uh, no that's okay, I'll just
call on her break, thank you.

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:43.218
<i>You're welcome.</i>

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.020
Bye.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.037
Martha?

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:05.307
Could I talk to you
for a few minutes?

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:06.541
I can't, I just--

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:09.511
Ten minutes, please?

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:13.381
Okay.

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:16.051
Thank you.

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:20.021
What do you want?

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:25.794
I'm having some real
difficulty with Rachel.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:28.463
She's turned my entire
family against me

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:31.166
and it's to the point
where I don't feel safe

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:34.069
leaving her with
my daughter Addy.

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:36.238
I want you to know that
I'm not judging you.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.673
I want to help Rachel,
but I can't do that

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:42.077
unless I know what
her real problems are.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:46.248
So I'm hoping that
maybe you could

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:50.185
help me understand
her, possibly?

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.187
Okay.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:55.457
Okay.

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:58.827
When you started using,
how did Rachel react?

01:05:00.597 --> 01:05:02.364
Using?

01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:04.633
When your addiction
first started.

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.434
Addiction?

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:10.005
I was never on drugs.

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:14.342
You called Greg a year
ago, asking for money.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:15.644
I never called Greg.

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:18.046
I haven't talked to
Greg in like five years.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:21.283
That must've been
Rachel that called him.

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:23.318
Maybe she got him
to send her money?

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.286
I don't know.

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:27.155
I never saw any of it.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:32.627
But if you didn't leave
for an addiction, then...

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.769
I left because
I was scared.

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:00.689
Martha...

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:02.390
She did this to me with a pair
of scissors when I told her

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:07.028
she couldn't go to a
concert with her friends.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:15.236
It took me a long time to accept
it, but she-- Rachel doesn't...

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:19.040
She doesn't feel things the way
that other people feel things.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:24.813
The way that people are
supposed to feel things.

01:06:24.915 --> 01:06:27.816
She's different.

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:32.354
I tried to get her help,
but she has a way

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:36.858
of making people see only
what she wants them to see.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:42.097
When she got
really violent,

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.769
It got so hard I just
I couldn't leave my room.

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:50.672
I couldn't fall asleep.

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:55.443
I was a prisoner in
my own house, so...

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.579
I left.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:59.314
I just left.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.716
Martha, why
didn't you tell us?

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:03.485
I couldn't say
anything, I mean...

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:04.619
where would she go?

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.454
Who would take her in?

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:07.589
Greg and I maybe--

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.090
If I told
you what she was,

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:10.558
would you have
given her a home?

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.496
Would you have given her a
room next to your own daughter?

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:16.898
No, I couldn't
say anything.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.733
They would've put
her in foster care

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:22.904
or she would've ended up
living on the street.

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:26.975
Running away was the last good
thing I did for my daughter.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:31.012
The last good thing?

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:35.183
Martha, do you have any
idea what you've done?

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:36.885
I know, I'm sorry.

01:07:36.987 --> 01:07:42.390
She killed a sweet, innocent
teenage girl named Leslie Miles.

01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:46.828
I'm sorry, but you
have to understand--

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:49.364
No, I don't have
to understand!

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:50.965
You put my whole
family and me in danger!

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:52.033
She's my daughter.

01:07:52.135 --> 01:07:54.235
So what?

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:58.106
I'm sorry, I
can't do this.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:03.445
Martha!

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:05.680
Martha I--

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.194
<i>Greg, it's me.</i>

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:21.863
<i>I just met with Martha--
I know you think I'm crazy</i>

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:24.131
<i>but Rachel
really is dangerous.</i>

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:26.134
So dangerous that
Martha felt like she

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:28.536
had to disappear to
get away from her.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:30.305
Martha never received
any of your money

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:31.840
because she wasn't
the one calling you!

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:34.375
Rachel needs serious
professional help.

01:08:34.478 --> 01:08:36.377
I don't feel safe
with her in the house.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.279
Greg, we need you.

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:40.448
I need you.

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:46.587
Please just come home.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:49.224
Addy I'm so sorry, I'll
be there in 20 minutes.

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:52.460
It's okay,
Rachel picked me up.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.529
Addy, listen to me.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.764
<i>I want you to run over to
Mrs. Wellington's house</i>

01:08:56.867 --> 01:08:59.567
<i>and stay there until I
get there, okay?</i>

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:01.236
Mom, what's wrong?

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.569
<i>Just do what I'm saying!</i>

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.171
<i>Go!</i>

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:05.707
Addy?

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:06.908
Can I say hi?

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.176
Sure.

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:09.109
There you go.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.246
Thank you.

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:12.212
Addy?

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.282
Hi mom!

01:09:14.384 --> 01:09:15.450
Rachel?

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:16.885
You really don't
have to worry.

01:09:16.987 --> 01:09:18.720
Addy and I are
doing just fine here.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.255
Rachel, listen to me.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:21.856
<i>How was your day?</i>

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:25.292
Where have you been, mom?

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:27.562
Rachel, put Addy
back on the phone.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.063
Hmm...

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:32.734
Rachel, let me
talk to my daughter.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.435
I thought you were.

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.371
Am I not your
little girl anymore?

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:37.604
Rachel...

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:39.807
Rachel, please!

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.423
Detective Cherfils.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:56.724
Pam, it's Cindy.

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:58.593
I have that information
that you needed.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:01.896
<i>Martha Cook has the scars to
prove how dangerous Rachel is,</i>

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:03.565
there's a well
documented history

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.733
of Rachel's
violence in her care!

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:07.902
Okay Cindy, I
will check into it.

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:10.004
She took Addy, they're
alone in the house

01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:12.507
and I'm a half hour away!

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:13.808
Cindy, don't worry.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:15.443
I'll head over there
right now and talk to her.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.578
Please hurry!

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.979
We can decide how
to move forward

01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:19.681
when you get there, okay?

01:10:38.235 --> 01:10:39.934
<i>Martha never received
any of your money</i>

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:41.469
<i>because she wasn't
the one calling you!</i>

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:43.972
<i>Rachel needs serious
professional help.</i>

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:46.174
<i>I don't feel safe
with her in the house.</i>

01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:48.042
<i>Greg, we need you.</i>

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:49.978
<i>I need you.</i>

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:17.438
Addy?

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.574
Addy?

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:25.446
Pam?

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:35.657
Rachel...

01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:37.091
Shh!

01:11:37.193 --> 01:11:39.827
I don't want
you to wake her.

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:41.696
What did you
do to her?

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.265
Just a little something
to help her sleep.

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:45.867
I decided you were right.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:48.202
It was time I paid
my respects to Tess.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.505
I told her about my
horrible nightmares

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:52.940
and she was kind
enough to share.

01:11:53.043 --> 01:11:55.743
What did you do today, mom?

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:58.813
Did you meet
anyone interesting?

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:00.214
What?

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:02.283
You think find-my-phone
only works for your kids?

01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:05.553
We can spy on you
just as easily.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:09.290
You're sick, honey.

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:11.125
Is that what she said?

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:16.431
No honey, you need help.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:20.101
Do I really look
like I need help?

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:23.438
I have the whole world
wrapped around my little finger.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:26.407
You of all people
should know that by now.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:32.313
And if I don't get what I
want, there are consequences.

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:34.482
No.

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:36.117
Don't touch her, please.

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:37.585
I just love how she sleeps.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:38.753
Rachel...

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.588
So innocent.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.358
Like nothing in the
world can hurt her.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.826
Don't please.

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:47.095
Your precious Addy.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:50.264
Your one and only.

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:53.034
No-- no.

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:55.937
See? Everybody lies!

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:57.372
Even you.

01:12:57.474 --> 01:12:59.941
Like when you said I was
part of the family, remember?

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.776
When you said I was
your daughter too.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.045
Oh honey, you are
part of the family.

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:05.947
You are my daughter.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:08.049
And now you want
to send me away?

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:10.685
Just like Martha.

01:13:10.787 --> 01:13:13.488
I just want to help you.

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.990
By putting me
in a padded room?

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:17.892
No-- I mean you need help.

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:20.661
But I will be
there with you.

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:27.568
I promise I will do this
with you every step of the way.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:29.504
Honey, I love you.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.406
You are my daughter.

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:33.408
Please!

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:36.844
I'm asking you
please put the gun down.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:38.312
We can do it together.

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:41.983
We will fix you
together, I promise.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:47.755
Wow, you're really
good at this!

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:50.057
Maybe you are my mother.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.160
No!

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:56.397
No! Please, don't
do anything to--

01:13:56.499 --> 01:13:58.399
Oh god, it's not for her.

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:00.201
I wouldn't hurt
my own sister.

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:02.270
It's for you.

01:14:02.372 --> 01:14:04.272
Back up.

01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:07.875
See, I need this to
look very real, so...

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:11.179
I'm going to have to ask
you to kill your friend Pam.

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:12.246
What?

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:13.548
That's right.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:17.018
Then I'm gonna shoot
you in self defense.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.956
And then when daddy gets home,
I'll explain to him how--

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:24.625
How mom just
hated me so much.

01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:26.227
And when she asked
me to leave,

01:14:26.329 --> 01:14:28.696
she got really angry and
she threatened to kill me.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.599
Then that policeman came
and she attacked her too

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:35.803
and I just had to
protect myself.

01:14:35.905 --> 01:14:37.104
Oh, Rachel.

01:14:37.207 --> 01:14:38.272
See, I could do it myself

01:14:38.374 --> 01:14:41.042
but this is going to
work out much better.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:43.778
Now pick it up.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.246
I can't.

01:14:45.348 --> 01:14:46.514
Well then I'm going to have
to shoot all three of you.

01:14:46.616 --> 01:14:49.617
No!
Okay, just wait.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:54.789
Oh god.

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:56.157
I don't know how
I'm gonna do this.

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:58.593
Just do it, or Addy dies.

01:14:58.695 --> 01:15:01.963
Okay, just...

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:03.798
I don't know how.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.700
I'm sorry.

01:15:05.802 --> 01:15:07.702
This must be really
difficult for you.

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:10.838
But, you know, it's
just not that hard.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.940
Actually, it's pretty easy...

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:23.184
We agreed no more.

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:27.321
Yeah, well I
changed my mind.

01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:30.691
What? You want some?

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:31.859
I'm telling the manager.

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.095
No, you can't do that!
She'll fire you.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:37.698
Maybe, but I'm
not going to jail.

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:42.770
No... you can't do that!

01:16:33.523 --> 01:16:36.324
Now it's your turn.

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:44.599
Okay, Rachel?

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:47.134
How did you deal
with the guilt?

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:49.136
Afterwards, how did
you deal with it?

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:52.807
Don't worry, you
won't have to.

01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:53.741
Now!

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:55.710
Okay.

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:10.224
We're in here!

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.037
Stop!

01:17:25.408 --> 01:17:27.441
My god, what's going on?

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:28.442
Cindy attacked me!

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:29.276
She tried to kill me.

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:30.845
No I didn't.

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:32.947
She attacked
that police woman.

01:17:33.049 --> 01:17:34.315
She tried to kill me.

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:35.850
No, she did!

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:37.118
Cindy, give me the gun.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.453
I didn't do anything Greg.

01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:43.157
Honey, give me
the gun, please.

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:46.627
Okay Greg, Pam will
be able to explain.

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:48.529
I'm sure she will.

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:50.564
Just give me the gun first.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:52.166
Daddy, I love you.

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:55.236
Please don't let her
hurt me daddy, please!

01:17:56.939 --> 01:17:58.305
Please don't let
her hurt me.

01:17:58.408 --> 01:18:01.075
Cindy, I trust you.

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:02.576
I got your message,
I came straight home.

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.045
Are you alright?

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:05.513
No daddy, please.

01:18:05.615 --> 01:18:06.847
Stop Rachel!

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:08.783
Please, please
I love you daddy!

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:12.053
Stop it! Stop lying.

01:18:13.423 --> 01:18:17.692
Cindy, I'm sorry.

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:20.094
I should've listened to you.

01:18:35.344 --> 01:18:39.046
Mom, please...
please.

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:42.049
Daddy, please!

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:48.989
Please, no!
Please...

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:04.805
I'm so sorry.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:10.111
I nearly lost
everything.

01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:12.379
Yeah, but you didn't.

01:19:12.482 --> 01:19:16.550
We're still here.

01:19:16.652 --> 01:19:19.854
And we're gonna
try, right?

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.418
Hi, Rachel.

01:19:51.521 --> 01:19:55.189
Hi dad, hi mom!

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.191
Oh, it's so good to
see you guys again.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.459
You have no idea.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:01.529
I missed you so much.

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:03.430
You look good, Rach.

01:20:03.533 --> 01:20:05.633
Thanks, mom.

01:20:05.735 --> 01:20:07.301
Did you guys talk
to the lawyers yet?

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:11.071
Did he say when
I can go home?

01:20:12.742 --> 01:20:15.009
Not yet, honey.

01:20:15.111 --> 01:20:17.344
Oh, really?

01:20:17.446 --> 01:20:19.113
Well I know he's
probably really busy.

01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:21.048
Maybe you guys
can talk to him again

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.551
and tell him that I really
didn't mean those things.

01:20:23.653 --> 01:20:27.054
I'm sorry but I'm
so much better now.

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:29.523
I just want to be a
part of the family again.

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:33.327
I love you guys so much.

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:36.997
We love you too, Rach.

01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:39.667
Hey, what do you
want to do today?

01:20:39.769 --> 01:20:44.505
I brought cards, and
the movie that you like.

01:20:44.607 --> 01:20:45.806
Let's play a game.

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:47.975
Okay. Hearts?

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:50.044
What do you think Rach?

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:51.779
Yeah, sure.

01:20:51.881 --> 01:20:55.115
I guess we can talk
about that stuff later.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.174
Hey guys.

01:21:20.276 --> 01:21:23.844
Hey angel.

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:25.846
Oh my god!

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:28.115
Hi!

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:29.383
You like him?

01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:31.585
I love him.

01:21:31.687 --> 01:21:35.222
And she's all yours.

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:37.858
Will you take care of her?

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.928
I will, I promise.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.300
What an angel.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:47.735
She's a little
angel, right?

01:21:47.837 --> 01:21:49.003
She's perfect mom!

01:21:49.105 --> 01:21:50.271
Okay.

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:53.974
Think of a good name.
