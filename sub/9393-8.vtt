ANNOUNCER: <i>Do you want an excuse</i>
<i>to not go home this Christmas?</i>

00:39.473 --> 00:41.373
<i>Then fly Northwest Airlines.</i>

00:41.375 --> 00:44.076
<i>At Northwest Airlines,</i>
<i>thousands of employees</i>

00:44.078 --> 00:46.845
<i>are dedicated to delaying</i>
<i>and cancelling flights</i>

00:46.847 --> 00:48.881
<i>so you won't get home</i>
<i>for the holidays.</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:51.817
No way I'm getting you
on your connecting flight.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.919
No way we're taking off on time.

00:53.921 --> 00:57.089
Don't worry, I'm taking
this flight back to the gate.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.758
Do you think Jeff will
make it home this year?

00:59.760 --> 01:02.161
<i>No way--</i>
<i>because Jeff flew Northwest.</i>

01:02.163 --> 01:03.362
Thanks, Northwest.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.997
I hate my family.

01:04.999 --> 01:07.099
Ah, that looks great.

01:07.101 --> 01:10.102
You know, I think this is gonna
be our best Christmas ever.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.837
Yeah, but don't get
your hopes up, Lois.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.106
I couldn't afford to get you
what I got you last year.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.574
I know how you
like that song,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.376
so I got you two
turtledoves.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.778
Where did you get these?

01:19.780 --> 01:22.381
I went to a scientist and had
them genetically engineered.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.049
Fly, beautiful turtledoves.

01:24.051 --> 01:25.951
Bring Christmas cheer to all.

01:25.953 --> 01:28.287
(turtlesdoves screeching,
all yelling)

01:28.289 --> 01:30.456
Everybody outside-- we'll do
the rest of Christmas outside!

01:30.458 --> 01:32.191
Go, go, go!

01:32.193 --> 01:36.228
Look, Stewie, I'm hanging the
ornament you made at preschool.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.463
Just hang it up.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.031
Why do you have to narrate
everything you do?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.066
Peter, you want to put
the star on top of the...

01:41.068 --> 01:43.202
Hang on, hang on, Lois,
I always wanted to do this.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.105
Wait a second.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.273
It's coming.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.375
There it is!

01:52.579 --> 01:53.812
Huh?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.047
Eh, it's something,

01:55.049 --> 01:56.915
but you still
got a leftover "R."

01:56.917 --> 01:58.050
This was hard.

01:58.052 --> 01:59.885
I did this for you!

02:01.087 --> 02:02.654
This one's my favorite ornament.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.257
I can only imagine what it
must have been like for them

02:05.259 --> 02:07.126
on that very first Christmas.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.827
Yeah, it was probably
very moving...

02:08.829 --> 02:09.895
and fictional.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.597
Jesus lived with us
for, like, a week.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.165
What else do you need?

02:13.167 --> 02:15.467
It's the greatest
story ever told, Meg.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.003
A story that goes back
over a hundred years.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.639
Yay, <i>Star Wars!</i>
<i>No, Chris.</i>

02:20.641 --> 02:24.176
It's the story of Christmas
and the Immaculate Conception.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.644
You guys were born
the dirty way.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.081
Now, gather around, everybody,
and hear the awe-inspiring tale

02:29.083 --> 02:32.184
that's caused millions
and millions of deaths.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.119
Many years ago
there was a hardworking

02:34.121 --> 02:36.088
<i>young carpenter named Joseph,</i>

02:36.090 --> 02:38.757
<i>and one day, Joseph and his</i>
<i>friend Robby were hanging...</i>

02:38.759 --> 02:40.692
CHRIS:
Guy's name was Robby back then?

02:40.694 --> 02:42.261
PETER:
<i>The Bible is fuzzy on that.</i>

02:42.263 --> 02:43.862
<i>Anyway, Joseph and Robby</i>
<i>were hanging out</i>

02:43.864 --> 02:45.531
<i>one day when this happened...</i>

02:45.533 --> 02:47.933
So, I went to see that new
Oedipus play last week.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.469
Took my mother-- talk
about an awkward ride home.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.970
Barely got a good-night kiss.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.039
Hey, Joseph,
check it out.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.878
Oh, my God,
look at that body.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.881
Can't you just imagine her
standing on people's front lawns

03:02.883 --> 03:04.349
inside a cut-in-half bathtub?

03:04.351 --> 03:07.452
You should go talk to her
and see if she can talk.

03:07.454 --> 03:10.389
Uh, hi.
I'm... I'm Joseph.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.524
Oh, hello. I'm Mary.

03:12.526 --> 03:16.128
Listen, um, I was wondering if
you'd like to go out sometime.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.230
Well, sure.
That sounds nice.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.299
You know, there's
a beautiful spot outside of town

03:20.301 --> 03:22.167
where they dump
all the foreskins.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.736
You can sit on top
and watch the sunset.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.171
Oh, great, and maybe
we could slaughter a lamb

03:26.173 --> 03:28.073
and light it on fire
so that it rains.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.242
Well, let's not
go too fast.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.177
Listen, I'll see
you later, okay?

03:32.179 --> 03:33.912
I've got to go sit in a
circle with the other women

03:33.914 --> 03:36.248
and stare off
into the fields.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.916
All right,
you got a date.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.152
Yeah, I just hope it goes
better than my last one.

03:40.154 --> 03:42.487
Wow, Joseph,
that was great.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.656
Yeah, I got to say
I'm a little disappointed.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.191
When you said I could do you
in your "mudhut,"

03:46.193 --> 03:48.227
I thought you meant
something else.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.396
PETER:
<i>And so Mary and Joseph</i>
<i>began their courtship.</i>

03:51.398 --> 03:53.999
<i>But even after several dates,</i>

03:54.001 --> 03:55.934
<i>Joseph couldn't get</i>
<i>to first base.</i>

03:55.936 --> 03:57.436
<i>Not just because</i>
<i>Mary was a virgin,</i>

03:57.438 --> 04:00.339
<i>but because baseball would not</i>
<i>be invented for 1,800 years</i>

04:00.341 --> 04:02.507
<i>and nobody knew what the hell</i>
<i>he was talking about.</i>

04:02.509 --> 04:05.844
You know this is the same picnic
basket we drowned my sister in.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.346
It was back when they were like,
"Drown all the girls,"

04:07.348 --> 04:09.414
and then they were like,
"Don't drown all the girls,"

04:09.416 --> 04:12.851
but she was born on a
drowning week, so, you know.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.186
(sneezes)

04:14.188 --> 04:17.289
Oh, look at that--
there's hardly any blood.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.557
You're very healthy.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.592
Well, I try
to take care of myself.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.295
Joseph, this is the most
fun I've had in a while.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.963
That's good, that's good.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.698
Pull your pants down.
What?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.400
Come on, this is
our seventh date.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.801
It's completely natural.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.403
Birds do it, bees do it,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.405
dinosaurs whom we live
alongside do it.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.773
Joseph, I can't.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.275
People will talk.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.709
So, what?
They'll talk in Aramaic.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.111
Do you understand that?
I don't.

04:39.113 --> 04:42.414
Look, you're very sweet,
but I have to save myself.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.150
For who? There's only
30 people in the whole world

04:45.152 --> 04:47.052
and you're related
to half of them.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.987
I can't believe how hard
you're making me work.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.923
Well, I do have
a very good virginity coach.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.226
No, no, no.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.328
Okay, I think I got it.
How's this?

04:56.330 --> 05:00.332
(imitating):
No, no, no.

05:00.334 --> 05:04.002
No, no, no.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.337
Look, I can't explain it,

05:05.339 --> 05:07.506
but something is
telling me to wait.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.008
Something deep,
deep inside of me.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.610
Stop talking like that
or I swear to God

05:11.612 --> 05:13.312
I'm gonna Pompeii
all over this blanket.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.013
(laughing):
Oh, you're silly.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.316
Come on, let's
just watch the show.

05:17.318 --> 05:20.319
(all shouting angrily)

05:20.321 --> 05:21.787
Wow, she's really getting it.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.189
Yeah, I know that girl--
that's Donna Magdalene,

05:24.191 --> 05:27.392
and her sister's a
bigger slut than she is.

05:31.264 --> 05:34.266
You know, we Jews got it right,
working with our hands.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.868
Yeah, let those eggheads
in Rome do the brain work,

05:36.870 --> 05:38.837
we Jews will do
the brawn work.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.106
Hey, Italians, put a book
down once in a while.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.341
Yeah, yeah, right.
Definitely, yeah.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.942
Put a book down.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.377
Hey, so, uh,
you've been seeing

05:45.379 --> 05:47.312
that girl Mary
for some time now.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.313
She's pretty smoking.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.815
Aw, man, she is so hot.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.317
She's gonna go down in history
as "Hot Bitch Mary."

05:52.319 --> 05:54.219
You know, I'm thinking
of popping the question.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.054
Really?
Yeah, I figure
I'm 14 now,

05:56.056 --> 05:57.622
I'm not getting
any younger.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.358
Hey, look,
it's the burning bush!

05:59.360 --> 06:01.326
Hail Mary,
full of guys.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.295
Oh come all
ye face-full.

06:03.297 --> 06:05.297
Come on, guys,
that's really dirty.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.298
Hi, Joseph.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.999
Hey, Mary,
what's going on?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.534
Oh, I just thought
I'd take a break

06:09.536 --> 06:11.803
from pooping in the open
street to come see you.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.171
That's nice.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.073
Listen, can you
come by my house later?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.342
There's something important
I have to share with you.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.343
Okay, sure.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.544
I'll come by
around that part

06:19.546 --> 06:20.979
of the day when
the sun goes away

06:20.981 --> 06:22.514
and we're all terrified
it will never come back.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.649
Okay, bye.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.318
Wow, you're a
lucky man, Joseph.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.352
I know.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.254
So, what have you
got going on later?

06:29.256 --> 06:31.356
I think I might hang
out in the town square.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.492
I hear an oracle from Greece
is sending a funny message

06:33.494 --> 06:35.494
and I want to be
there when it arrives.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.071
(panting)

06:49.442 --> 06:51.943
Penis.
Ha.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.282
Hey, Mary.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.617
Oh, hi, Joseph.
Come on in.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.352
Thanks, hey, listen
I just got tickets

07:00.354 --> 07:01.686
to see Cher in Bethlehem.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.854
You want to go?

07:02.856 --> 07:05.223
I guess-- how close
are the seats?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.291
Row L-X-V-I.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.859
That sounds great.

07:07.861 --> 07:11.062
But, look, Joseph, there's
something I have to tell you.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.364
I'm pregnant.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.532
From my finger?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.100
No, you don't understand.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.602
God has blessed me
with his child.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.372
You banged Kevin God
from South Nazareth?

07:20.374 --> 07:22.941
No, no, Joseph,
I mean God.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.210
I'm carrying God's baby.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.546
He-he sent down an angel.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.387
(gasps)

07:35.389 --> 07:36.555
Fear not, pretty lady

07:36.557 --> 07:38.723
who ain't never
had no relations.

07:38.725 --> 07:41.460
I's been sent to bring you
the message that tonight

07:41.462 --> 07:44.296
you's gonna be getting
pregnant with the Son of God.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.331
It's a miracle, yay!

07:46.333 --> 07:47.599
I am?

07:47.601 --> 07:49.468
Yeah, and it's gonna
be here soon,

07:49.470 --> 07:51.269
so you might want
to spruce yourself up.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.171
Maybe walk in the
creek a little bit.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.607
Oh, and he probably don't
want me to tell you this,

07:55.609 --> 07:57.576
but be ready 'cause
he might give you

07:57.578 --> 07:59.411
a little bit of
a donkey punch.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.513
So you're saying God
got you pregnant?

08:01.515 --> 08:04.483
Yes, Joseph.
Glory in the highest!

08:04.485 --> 08:06.818
Well, if it his will,
then his will be done,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.587
and I am but his
humble servant.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.754
But I do have one question.

08:09.756 --> 08:10.989
Was he bigger than me?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.624
Joseph,
it wasn't like that.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.693
I felt nothing.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.595
Oh, little guy.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.969
ANNOUNCER:
<i>We now return</i>
<i>to</i> A Christmas Carol.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.837
(wind blows)

08:25.839 --> 08:28.773
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Past.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.609
Oh, hello.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.712
I am here to show you
how you lost your way.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.480
Um, oh, okay.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.282
How long is this gonna take?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.985
I don't know,
maybe eight minutes?

08:39.987 --> 08:43.388
Okay, hang on, I just
got to use the bathroom.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.791
(urinating)

08:56.302 --> 08:58.403

I am the Ghost
of Christmas Pres...

09:43.183 --> 09:46.017
Wait, you haven't
gone yet?
No.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.253
(urinating stops)
Okay, here we go.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.790
(farts)
Sorry this is turning
into something else.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.858
All right, kids,
gather around.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.728
Time to make our yearly terrible
call to Great Aunt Helen.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.130
(buttons beep)

09:59.132 --> 10:00.298
(phone rings)

10:00.300 --> 10:02.200
HELEN:
Hello?

10:02.202 --> 10:06.171
Hi, Aunt Helen, it's Peter,
Lois and the whole family.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.008
Peter's lowest what?
We're calling to say
Merry Christmas...

10:12.144 --> 10:14.813
Are you there, dear?
We-we were just
calling to...

10:16.282 --> 10:18.383
We had quite a cold snap here.
I hope you
got our card.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.485
Okay, nobody talk-- we'll
just wait for her to talk.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.058
Are you still there, dear?
Well, we just
wanted to...

10:27.060 --> 10:28.994
Damn it!

10:28.996 --> 10:30.962
So, how was the...
It's been rather cold.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.965
The pond froze over
a family of raccoons.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.969
Are you there, dear?
All right, well,
Merry Christmas.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.573
Dad, can we hear more of that
story about the baby Jesus?

10:41.575 --> 10:43.775
Ah, right. Now
everybody listen up

10:43.777 --> 10:46.611
while I stuff the rest of this
rhetoric down your throats.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.912
Now, if you remember,

10:47.914 --> 10:51.383
Mary and Joseph were on
their way to Bethlehem.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.487
Uch, look at that.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.088
I remember when this
was all desert.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.289
You know, when
the baby comes,

10:58.291 --> 10:59.924
we could probably
homeschool him.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.293
I can count up to nine.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.329
Yeah, hey, so tell me
one more time how it is

11:04.331 --> 11:05.664
that God got you pregnant.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.132
'Cause when <i>you</i> tell me
the story,

11:07.134 --> 11:08.266
it sorta makes sense.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.801
But then when I tell
the guys at work,

11:09.803 --> 11:11.369
they poke all kinds
of holes in it.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.005
So, you guys are going
to Bethlehem, huh?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.274
I went there one time on
a donkeys' night out.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.644
Oh, my God,
I got <i>so</i> hammered!

11:19.646 --> 11:23.348

<i>their way to Bethlehem,</i>

11:26.820 --> 11:30.388

11:30.390 --> 11:31.456
<i>Chris, did you get a haircut?</i>

11:31.458 --> 11:32.991
CHRIS:
<i>I did.</i>

11:32.993 --> 11:34.793
PETER:
<i>I'm just noticing.</i>
<i>It looks nice.</i>

11:36.028 --> 11:37.462
Hey, what's this?

11:39.331 --> 11:41.466
Hey, you guys, this says
a King of Kings

11:41.468 --> 11:42.667
will be born
in Bethlehem,

11:42.669 --> 11:44.369
and we are to go
and pay tribute.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.804
Hey, let me see that.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.073
This says,
"Three Magi or Resident."

11:48.075 --> 11:50.241
I don't think they
really care if it's us.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.543
Yeah, I don't want
to go, either.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.546
Hey, isn't your mother-in-law
visiting tomorrow?

11:54.548 --> 11:56.414
We're off

Yeah, it's amazing how

interfere with small business.

Oh, no, we're
out of water.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.425
We gotta
stop somewhere.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.427
Look. That's
King Herod's palace.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.229
Maybe we can get
water over there.

Wow, look at that classy,
Middle Eastern house

13:20.934 --> 13:22.433

13:26.940 --> 13:29.607
Uch, I'm so bored.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.775
How's the TV coming?

13:30.777 --> 13:33.178
We are a long way off.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.612
Excuse me.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.816
We are three wise men
on a long journey.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.417
Could we trouble you
for some water?

13:39.419 --> 13:42.320
Sure. Not quite wise enough
to pack any, huh?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.955
So, what brings you to Judea?

13:43.957 --> 13:46.357
We're on our way to Bethlehem
to see a magic baby.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.859
Magic baby?
What's he do,

13:47.861 --> 13:49.294
card tricks,
rabbit in the hat?

13:49.296 --> 13:50.662
Would he let someone
in the audience

13:50.664 --> 13:51.996
punch him in
the stomach?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.998
I'd like to punch a
baby in the stomach.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.333
You can't punch
this baby.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.534
He's the Messiah.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.603
Yes, they're even calling him
the King of Kings.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.471
Yuck.
He already sounds like a dick.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.106
Okay, then how about this?

14:02.108 --> 14:03.675
I'm the King of King
of Kings.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.109
Ha! New name! Called it!

14:05.111 --> 14:07.212
Sounds like somebody's
a little threatened.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.848
No, I'm not. Would a guy who
feels threatened make sure

14:09.850 --> 14:11.382
all his advisors
are shorter than him?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.117
Ha! You said
it, King!

14:13.119 --> 14:14.219
That's telling him!

14:14.221 --> 14:15.320
Big guy!

14:15.322 --> 14:17.222
You know what?
Still, just to be safe,

14:17.224 --> 14:19.290
I should probably kill
that baby.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.793
Then Jodie Foster will love me.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.297
Welcome to the
Motel Shiksa.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.233
We won't leave the
light on for you,

14:28.235 --> 14:30.501
because what, do I work
for the electric company?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.904
Yes, we were wondering
if you had a room available?

14:32.906 --> 14:35.173
Sorry, we're all booked up--
Cher's in town.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.208
You won't find a room
in the city.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.477
No room? Joseph,
what are we gonna do?

14:39.479 --> 14:41.646
Don't worry.
I got this covered.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.314
No rooms, eh?

14:43.316 --> 14:46.150
Well, perhaps you have a room
for my good friend

14:46.152 --> 14:47.752
fistful of sand.

14:47.754 --> 14:48.887
Where's your money?

14:48.889 --> 14:50.255
I spent it on sand.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.856
I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.057
But, sir, please,

14:53.059 --> 14:55.693
my wife is with child
and about to give birth.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.329
And I am with burrito
and about to do the same.

14:58.331 --> 15:02.200
Sir, if you don't leave now,
I'm gonna have to call IX-I-I.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.168
Yeah, we, we did one
of those earlier.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.403
Yours is better, though.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.272
We probably should've waited
for yours.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.207

15:09.209 --> 15:10.508
Joseph, my water
just broke!

15:10.510 --> 15:11.843
It's time!

15:11.845 --> 15:13.111
Oh, my God!

15:13.113 --> 15:15.380
Please, you've gotta
have <i>some</i> place for us!

15:15.382 --> 15:16.514
We're desperate!

15:16.516 --> 15:19.050
Well, there's
a manger out back.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.785
You can stay there.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.387
That's fine, that's fine!
We'll take it!

15:22.389 --> 15:24.122
CHER (in distance):
Bethlehem!

15:24.124 --> 15:26.291
I have one question for you!

15:26.293 --> 15:27.458
(pop song plays)

15:27.460 --> 15:31.396
♪ Do you believe in life
after love? ♪

15:31.398 --> 15:34.365
Dah... See?
I told you she'd open with that.

15:39.071 --> 15:42.473
So, Joseph and Mary
were turned away
from the inn.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.908
But, Dad, I still
don't understand

15:43.910 --> 15:45.543
the whole Immaculate
Conception thing.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.112
How can anyone get pregnant
without having sex?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.881
Oh, there's lots of
stories of that, Meg.

15:49.883 --> 15:51.382
Cleveland's got
a cousin who had

15:51.384 --> 15:52.784
eight girlfriends
get pregnant,

15:52.786 --> 15:55.119
and he says he's not
responsible for a single one.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.788
Good guy.
You shake his hand,

15:56.790 --> 15:58.890
it feels like you're
touching a nice briefcase.

15:58.892 --> 16:01.125
But back to our story.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.497
All right, here we are.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.999
This seems pretty gross.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.768
I can't believe my baby's
gonna be the Son of God.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.004
Looks like all those
years fighting off

16:13.006 --> 16:15.640
my own father's advances
have finally paid off.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.141
What shall we name him?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.943
Well, this is kinda
like a barn.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.478
We could call
him Barney.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.479
Yeah, maybe.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.014
Or I kinda always
liked Tristan.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.349
Oh, my God, you want him

16:24.351 --> 16:25.917
to get the crap
beat out of him?

16:25.919 --> 16:28.086
They will crucify him
with a name like that.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.921
No, no, no.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.923
What are you doing?
How long you been there?

16:31.925 --> 16:33.791
Those names is no good.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.960
Look, why don't y'all
just give me a list,

16:35.962 --> 16:38.496
I'll run 'em up to God,
and see if he picks one.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.631
No... no...

16:40.633 --> 16:42.700
That's the name
of a champagne.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.102
No... no...

16:44.104 --> 16:45.003
Terrible!

16:45.005 --> 16:46.304
These are all
just terrible!

16:46.306 --> 16:47.505
Relax, God.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.974
You want me to get y'all
some wine and cheeses?

16:49.976 --> 16:51.709
Wait, what'd you
just say?

16:51.711 --> 16:55.380
Cheeses.
You want some cheeses?

16:55.382 --> 16:57.015
And that's why you're
allowed to eat

16:57.017 --> 17:01.853
as much mozzarella as
you want in any church.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.889
<i>So the three wise men set off</i>
<i>again on their journey.</i>

17:04.891 --> 17:06.190
You sure this is
the right way?

17:06.192 --> 17:09.027
Yes, I'm sure.
We follow the star.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.895
Are you sure
that's a star?

17:10.897 --> 17:12.397
We've had this
conversation!

17:12.399 --> 17:13.998
Yes, it's a star!

17:14.000 --> 17:15.566

red lights!

17:18.004 --> 17:20.238

you stupid idiot!

17:22.408 --> 17:24.542
Hey, thanks for coming out
on such late notice, Doc.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.078
Oh, you don't
have to thank me.
This is a big deal.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.847
It's not every day
that God bestows a
woman with his son.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.816
Has it ever
happened before?
Yeah, once.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.584
But the woman drank
during her pregnancy.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.420
The kid came out
a real lemon.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.189
I turned this
water into poo!

17:38.191 --> 17:39.690
Uh-huh.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.060
I also turned this
fish into poo!

17:42.062 --> 17:43.594
Ah...

17:43.596 --> 17:45.430
Do you want your
birthday present?

17:45.432 --> 17:47.932
I think I know
what it is.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.668
(laughs) It's a
cashmere sweater.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.903
Oh, wow!

17:51.905 --> 17:55.706
That's actually
really nice.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.707
And now it's poo!

18:05.285 --> 18:07.018
Okay, we're smiling,

18:07.020 --> 18:09.287
we're happy to
see Jesus.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.355
There we go.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.957
Hey, guys,
watch your step in there.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.927
That floor's gonna be dripping
in virgin olive oil.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.462
That's kinda hot.
Gross.

18:17.464 --> 18:21.099
Hello, we are
the three wise men.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.201
We came here
following a star.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.269
Those two statements
contradict each other.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.071
We also come
bearing gifts.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.439
I brought frankincense.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.540
I brought myrrh.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.309
And I brought you
a breast pump,

18:31.311 --> 18:33.544
which in these times
is just a guy.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.979
When do I start?

18:34.981 --> 18:37.048
Oh he's coming!

18:37.050 --> 18:39.117
Oh, it hurts so bad!

18:39.119 --> 18:40.751
God, I hate working
on Christmas.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.553
Oh, here he comes.

18:45.757 --> 18:48.493
And... BC turns to AD!

18:48.495 --> 18:50.294
How's everybody doing?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.996
Oh, he's a miracle!

18:51.998 --> 18:54.565
Hey, if you're a virgin, how
come I shot out of there

18:54.567 --> 18:56.667
like a greased-up
cannonball?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.736
Greetings!
I have come to see

18:58.738 --> 19:02.573
the newborn king, but sadly,
I bring no gift.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.275
Well, what do you got
in your hand there?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.943
Uh, my drum.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.512
Well, then it looks like
you got him a drum.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.748
Pretty good gift.
But this is all I own.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.950
It's what makes me
the "Little Drummer Boy."

19:12.952 --> 19:15.920
Yeah, the baby
wants the drum.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.189
Yeah! Drum!

19:18.191 --> 19:20.658
Okay, nobody touch my hair.
I'm growing it out.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.493
Also, I'm gonna start dieting
and working out

19:22.495 --> 19:24.028
so I'm like crazy lean

19:24.030 --> 19:25.997
for the, you know, for, for,
for the thing.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.265
(hoofbeats approaching)

19:27.267 --> 19:28.432
What the deuce?

19:30.469 --> 19:33.204
Bring out the Christ Child!
We want him!

19:33.206 --> 19:34.138
Uh-oh.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.840
(whirring)

19:40.946 --> 19:44.849
I may have a virgin mom,
but I am one bad mother.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.254
(horse whinnies)

19:57.829 --> 19:59.797
Ah! Ah! You guys get him!
You guys get him!

19:59.799 --> 20:01.232
I forgot something
at the palace!

20:03.702 --> 20:06.404
Pa-choo! Pa-choo!
(makes explosion sound)

20:06.406 --> 20:08.739
And that is the
story of Jesus.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.508
That was awesome, Dad!

20:10.510 --> 20:11.876
Oh, my God! I
just realized

20:11.878 --> 20:14.345
that's the same Jesus as
the Jesus from church!

20:14.347 --> 20:16.047
That's a beautiful story,
Peter,

20:16.049 --> 20:17.548
about people coming together

20:17.550 --> 20:19.717
to form something
greater than themselves.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.252
(knocking on door)

20:22.221 --> 20:23.154
Yes, can I help you?

20:23.156 --> 20:24.522
Hi. We're from out of town

20:24.524 --> 20:26.090
and our car
just broke down!

20:26.092 --> 20:28.025
My wife's in labor.
Can we use your phone?

20:28.027 --> 20:29.060
What?! No!

20:29.062 --> 20:32.196
Couple of freaking scumbags
working some scam,

20:32.198 --> 20:34.031
saying how they want
to use our phone.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.701
What?! Do they want all the
presents under the tree, too?!

20:36.703 --> 20:37.835
Get rid of 'em!

20:37.837 --> 20:39.937
They're not gonna
do that, are they?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.672
Dad, shut the door,
it's freezing!

20:41.674 --> 20:43.040
Please, you've
gotta help us!

20:43.042 --> 20:44.275
You're lucky
it's Christmas

20:44.277 --> 20:46.110
or I'd call the cops on
you dirty grifters!

20:46.112 --> 20:49.213
Now you and your whore
wife get out of here!

20:49.215 --> 20:53.184
Peter, you handled
that perfectly.

20:53.186 --> 20:54.919
Merry Christmas,
Lois.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.255
MAN:
Please!
We're begging you!

20:57.257 --> 20:58.823
I'm getting
the baseball bat.
