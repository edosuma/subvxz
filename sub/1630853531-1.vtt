01:46.773 --> 01:48.441
<i>That was a crazy one.</i>

01:49.651 --> 01:51.694
<i>Sometimes when I first wake up,</i>

01:52.278 --> 01:54.656
<i>my heart is racing and my throat is dry.</i>

01:55.406 --> 01:58.284
<i>Can't figure out if the pills are making</i>
<i>the dreams more real</i>

01:58.785 --> 02:00.703
<i>or the reason they're not worse.</i>

02:01.287 --> 02:03.665
<i>Even on good days,</i>
<i>I still feel like I don't fit in.</i>

02:04.374 --> 02:06.876
<i>Like everyone else has it all figured out.</i>

02:07.460 --> 02:09.003
<i>The clothes they wear.</i>

02:09.087 --> 02:10.421
<i>The bands they like.</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:12.465
<i>Who they are.</i>

02:13.383 --> 02:14.300
<i>Who they wanna be.</i>

02:15.969 --> 02:17.679
<i>And I'm the only one</i>

02:18.555 --> 02:19.931
<i>who's stuck pretending.</i>

02:51.629 --> 02:52.630
Juliette!

03:00.263 --> 03:01.598
Good morning, darling.

03:02.223 --> 03:04.142
-Sleep well?
-Uh, sure.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.855
I refilled these for you.

03:08.938 --> 03:13.693
-You were almost out.
-Already? Are you feeling okay?

03:15.737 --> 03:16.571
I'm fine.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.533
<i>Of course I'm not fine and they know it.</i>

03:20.617 --> 03:22.368
<i>They just want me to say it out loud.</i>

03:22.869 --> 03:23.703
<i>But I won't.</i>

03:24.203 --> 03:26.748
<i>Because that would be</i>
<i>the end of everything</i>

03:27.415 --> 03:29.334
<i>and I'm not ready for whatever comes next.</i>

03:29.417 --> 03:30.251
Juliette.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.338
It's been three weeks since your birthday.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.090
We know you're nervous
but we both think that it's time you--

03:36.174 --> 03:38.051
-Morning.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.719
Morning.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.097
Elinor, have you been out all night?

03:43.181 --> 03:45.642
If I'm home now, does it really matter?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.810
It does when you work for me.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.729
Have I ever been late?

03:50.230 --> 03:53.149
<i>Elinor, my role model.</i>

03:53.983 --> 03:57.654
<i>One day, I, too, will be a self-confident,</i>
<i>bull-by-the-horns kind of girl</i>

03:57.737 --> 03:59.572
<i>who doesn't give a shit</i>
<i>what my parents think.</i>

04:02.367 --> 04:06.746
Juliette, could you please
remind Ben that we have a doorbell?

04:06.829 --> 04:08.122
Oh, he knows.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.084
We'll come back to these?

04:26.432 --> 04:28.351
That isn't your color.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.272
Sorry.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.109
Much better, sweet little.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.779
One day, I am going to kill him.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.448
I would never allow that.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.330
Ms. Fairmont, I do declare.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.332
You are the prettiest peach I ever seen.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.502
Well, aren't you just the sweetest thing?

05:35.084 --> 05:37.712
<i>Ben Wheeler is the kind of boy</i>
<i>you fall in love with.</i>

05:39.422 --> 05:41.591
<i>We've been jumping around in dirty puddles</i>

05:41.674 --> 05:45.344
<i>and reading every book</i>
<i>on my mother's shelf since we were born.</i>

05:46.596 --> 05:48.806
<i>We dated for a month when we were 12.</i>

05:49.932 --> 05:51.893
<i>Before we both figured out,</i>

05:52.643 --> 05:53.478
<i>well,</i>

05:54.437 --> 05:55.897
<i>what we really wanted.</i>

06:00.151 --> 06:01.694
<i>Now he's the cool kid.</i>

06:01.778 --> 06:05.114
<i>The star athlete who gets invited</i>
<i>to all the parties.</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:08.242
<i>And I'm popular by association.</i>

06:12.538 --> 06:13.623
<i>Bottom line,</i>

06:13.706 --> 06:16.125
<i>when I'm with Ben, I blend in.</i>

06:16.209 --> 06:17.835
<i>My body is still changing.</i>

06:17.919 --> 06:20.713
<i>The headaches are still raging</i>
<i>but nobody knows,</i>

06:20.797 --> 06:23.299
<i>because he makes me feel and look normal.</i>

06:23.382 --> 06:25.676
And fun and sexy,
but I don't wanna try too hard.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.886
Yeah.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.888
What are you grinning at?

06:28.971 --> 06:29.806
Your face.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.018
Hey, lots of people like this face.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.396
Noah Harrington likes this face.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.857
Noah Harrington has a girlfriend.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.319
Noah Harrington's confused,
but he'll come out.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.289
Another migraine?

06:56.874 --> 06:58.084
Uh, yeah.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.836
Stay out of the sun.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.212
It makes them worse.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.598
<i>There.</i>

07:12.682 --> 07:13.933
<i>That's better.</i>

07:14.016 --> 07:15.435
<i>Another swing at normal.</i>

07:29.740 --> 07:31.242
So I'll pick you up at 9:00?

07:31.909 --> 07:33.661
-For what?
-The party.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.247
At Noah's. You promised you'd go.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.916
Why would I do that? I hate parties.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.961
But you love me and you have to go.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.379
You're my wingman.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.338
Woman.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.257
Wingwoman.

07:59.187 --> 08:03.900
Look, far be it from me
to stand in the way of quiet pining,

08:03.983 --> 08:07.320
but, you know, you could just talk to her.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.030
I have.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.576
Yeah, no, we've definitely...

08:15.244 --> 08:16.162
talked.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.802
Aren't you in my...

08:36.098 --> 08:37.433
Catch you later.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.572
Okay. Why don't you just start
with something small, like your name?

08:59.664 --> 09:02.416
We could do a whole Cyrano thing
where I could be doing the--

09:02.500 --> 09:04.168
I know who Cyrano is.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.086
And no.

09:05.711 --> 09:06.796
Okay.

09:06.879 --> 09:07.964
Back to the party.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.424
Got that Prada jacket.
I'll go vintage on the bottom

09:10.508 --> 09:12.802
so I don't look like a label whore.
Watch out!

09:12.885 --> 09:14.053
Mm! Oh.

09:15.096 --> 09:15.930
Sorry.

09:16.013 --> 09:16.973
I'm so sorry.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.766
I'm sorry. That was my fault.

09:22.061 --> 09:22.895
Oh.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.188
Hi.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.940
Hi.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.319
It's Juliette, right?

09:30.403 --> 09:31.571
We have English together.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.072
Yeah. Yeah.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.824
And Physics.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.617
And Gym.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.287
Um, you're Calliope?

09:39.370 --> 09:40.705
Cal's good.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.623
Why?

09:43.124 --> 09:44.375
What?

09:44.875 --> 09:47.628
Oh, I just mean I like Calliope.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.797
It's strange.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.133
I mean, it's--

09:52.216 --> 09:53.968
-It's beautiful.
-Is it?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.096
Classic?

09:58.055 --> 09:58.931
Classical?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.226
You should meet my brothers
Theseus and Apollo.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.152
Um, but there's a party.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.029
Tonight at Noah's.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.823
My friend Ben is making me go.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.325
I'm not big on parties.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.618
Me either.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.202
They're dumb.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.913
But I promised I'd go so...

10:24.707 --> 10:25.583
I'll be there.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.754
If you decide to go too,
then maybe I'll see you?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.340
Yeah.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.257
Okay.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.301
Cool.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.720
Wait. Wait!

10:51.651 --> 10:52.568
Don't worry.

10:54.028 --> 10:54.945
I got it.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.364
Make a wish?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.742
I think that only works with eyelashes.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.328
Oh.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.378
Tonight?

11:11.545 --> 11:12.713
Okay.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.383
Awesome.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.300
Great.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.219
See you there, Calliope.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.930
But I guess I'll see you in English first.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.475
Yes, right.

11:25.059 --> 11:25.976
Mr. Porter.

11:26.894 --> 11:27.728
Bye.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.242
Hey.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.661
You don't wanna miss this one.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.956
Everybody's gonna be there.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.209
I hope that's a love letter
to Flannery O'Connor.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.669
Yes, sir. It sure is.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.715
<i>I've always been sensitive.</i>

11:58.134 --> 11:59.593
<i>But it's getting worse.</i>

12:00.803 --> 12:02.096
<i>Every day,</i>

12:02.596 --> 12:04.515
<i>the world is a little sharper.</i>

12:05.433 --> 12:06.809
<i>A little louder.</i>

12:14.775 --> 12:15.818
<i>And today,</i>

12:16.402 --> 12:18.612
<i>just when I think it's too much,</i>

12:19.280 --> 12:20.364
<i>I bumped into you.</i>

12:20.448 --> 12:22.408
Ms. Burns. I know you just transferred in,

12:22.491 --> 12:25.703
but surely clocks work
the same way at your old school.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.954
Sorry.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.080
That's all right.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.500
Since you're already up, I'm sure
you won't mind getting us started.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.551
"Hazel Motes
sat at a forward angle

12:40.634 --> 12:42.470
on the green, plush train seat."

12:42.553 --> 12:46.432
"Looking one minute at the window
as if he might wanna jump out of it,

12:46.515 --> 12:49.393
and the next down the aisle
at the other end of the car."

12:49.477 --> 12:51.645
"The train was racing
through tree tops..."

12:51.729 --> 12:53.522
<i>Who are you, Calliope Burns?</i>

12:55.149 --> 12:56.567
<i>Why do you show up now?</i>

13:02.740 --> 13:05.576
<i>I can't shake the fear</i>
<i>that as soon as I blink,</i>

13:06.494 --> 13:07.786
<i>you'll disappear.</i>

13:07.870 --> 13:10.289
"The plowed fields curved and faded,

13:10.372 --> 13:14.752
and the few hogs nosing in the furrows
looked like large, spotted stones."

13:16.629 --> 13:18.214
Thank you, Calliope.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.591
So let's talk about setting.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.844
Setting is never
just a backdrop in a story.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.929
It's a character,

13:25.012 --> 13:26.805
often the first one we meet.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.308
It's important, then, to note...

13:29.391 --> 13:31.185
<i>You're not my first crush.</i>

13:31.268 --> 13:32.311
<i>Not even my second.</i>

13:32.394 --> 13:34.480
<i>But this one feels different,</i>

13:35.064 --> 13:36.524
<i>more intense.</i>

13:36.607 --> 13:38.734
<i>Like I know we're going to happen.</i>

13:40.110 --> 13:41.570
<i>I just don't know when.</i>

13:42.154 --> 13:46.492
<i>It's silly, but when you're</i>
<i>swimming around in my head like this,</i>

13:46.575 --> 13:48.661
<i>everything else disappears.</i>

13:50.371 --> 13:53.624
<i>Somehow, an hour goes by in five minutes.</i>

13:53.707 --> 13:56.043
-Essays due on Wednesday.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.670
Midterms on Friday.

13:57.753 --> 13:59.129
Mark the dates on your phones.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.590
That's what those calendar apps are for.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.106
You coming tonight?
Brad's gonna come, right?

14:17.189 --> 14:18.816
He has to come. He's bringing beer.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.308
Sounds good.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.226
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.686
Hey.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.068
Oh, shit.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.449
Who wears pure silver?

15:15.331 --> 15:16.457
Oh, shit.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.292
Shit.

15:20.002 --> 15:20.836
Shit.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.690
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

15:42.441 --> 15:43.275
<i>That.</i>

15:43.901 --> 15:45.861
<i>I haven't told anyone, of course.</i>

15:45.945 --> 15:46.946
<i>Not even Ben.</i>

15:52.159 --> 15:54.703
<i>So why do I keep wishing I could tell you?</i>

16:06.548 --> 16:07.383
Mom?

16:23.232 --> 16:24.483
Were you calling me?

16:24.566 --> 16:25.567
I was.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.485
I'm home.

16:26.568 --> 16:27.861
I can see that.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.701
There's a party tonight
at Noah Harrington's

16:33.784 --> 16:35.577
and everyone's going,

16:35.661 --> 16:38.414
so I wanted to see if I could go.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.456
Hmm.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.042
You look peaked.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.628
Please tell me
the night terrors haven't started.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.338
How are you feeling?

16:46.422 --> 16:47.506
I feel great.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.675
Then I don't see why not.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.510
Okay.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.764
You can unhand me now.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.182
Oh. Yes.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.059
See you at dinner.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.649
Juliette.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.409
You went through my bag?

17:57.493 --> 17:58.911
Sit down, sweetie.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.080
You can't keep taking these.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.916
They clearly aren't effective anymore.
Your body is changing.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.417
My body, Mom.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.629
We shouldn't have let her wait this long.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.132
Dad, Dad, I'm not ready.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.134
It isn't that hard.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.511
Just choose someone.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.096
Margot, please. Just--

18:18.722 --> 18:20.641
Sweetie, I know that it's scary.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.644
No. No, it's not scary. It's wrong.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.398
-I don't know why I have to!
-Because every day you don't,

18:28.482 --> 18:31.610
you put yourself
and this entire family at risk.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.500
There are humans
trained to hunt and kill us.

18:46.583 --> 18:50.295
Your father has made it safe for us
in Savannah, as safe as he can,

18:50.379 --> 18:54.591
but we survived
by our commitment to blending in.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.636
Hiding in plain sight.

18:59.012 --> 19:02.099
And every day that you refuse
to embrace your nature,

19:02.182 --> 19:05.644
you are closer to the day
where it controls you.

19:06.145 --> 19:10.274
The day that you kill recklessly
because you simply must feed.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.236
Oh, no. What did you do this time, Jules?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.282
I just wanted to go to a party.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.075
Ooh. A party.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.202
Elinor, this is serious.

19:22.995 --> 19:23.829
Yes.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.247
Very.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.500
Is that what you plan to wear?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.419
Come with me. We can do better.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.761
This is not a game.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.263
I know.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.640
Then make her understand.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.184
I will.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.812
As soon as you take
your talons out of my arm.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.824
You know, it's okay
to be nervous, sweet little.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.202
Your first kill's a big step.

20:03.827 --> 20:04.995
It changes you.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.419
-What if I don't wanna change?
-You're already changing.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.214
Which is why the pills aren't working.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.549
Why your senses are heightened.

20:18.258 --> 20:22.221
The kill just kind of tips the scale.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.726
What was it like?

20:28.894 --> 20:29.978
Your first.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.523
Freddy.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.400
He was beautiful.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.277
Eyelashes for days

20:37.361 --> 20:39.196
and the most beautiful smile.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.491
You know, he barely even fought back.

20:43.992 --> 20:47.204
I think some people prefer to die young.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.834
Hair jewelry.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.795
That's what you need.

20:55.420 --> 21:00.133
The right hair jewelry
and a perfect big juicy carotid artery.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.220
You are going to have so much fun.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.349
Just go out there and find someone.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.435
Unless you already have.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.942
-I like her.
-You want her.

21:17.025 --> 21:17.943
No.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.445
I don't wanna hurt her.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.323
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.121
Does your throat
feel like it's on fire yet?

21:30.622 --> 21:32.582
Have you started crying blood?

21:33.625 --> 21:36.420
You keep putting this off,
it's only going to get worse.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.175
Okay, now purse your lips.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.023
Go on.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.065
Have a look.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.072
Just remember.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.951
Stay calm, be prepared,

22:09.828 --> 22:11.788
and always finish what you start.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.976
Jules, Benny, you came!

23:15.060 --> 23:17.312
-Where's the host?
-Boop!

23:18.980 --> 23:20.649
Check the patio.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.442
I love you guys.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.200
I'll find you later, okay?

23:30.283 --> 23:33.286
Wait, what? No.
I'm supposed to be your wingwoman.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.330
Yeah. Time for you to learn how to fly.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.290
-No.
-So fly, little bird.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.084
No, wait, Ben! Ben! Ben!

24:03.984 --> 24:05.944
Hey. What happened to Noah?

24:06.528 --> 24:07.529
Not important.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.466
Spin the bottle? Really?

24:29.342 --> 24:31.344
All right! Who's up?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.389
Come on!

24:35.932 --> 24:37.517
There we go.

24:52.490 --> 24:53.450
Oh?

24:55.118 --> 24:56.244
All right, then.

25:01.499 --> 25:02.417
Cheers.

25:13.595 --> 25:14.846
Ticktock.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.850
All right.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.646
So, who's spinning next?

25:31.780 --> 25:32.614
Hi.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.783
Hi.

25:46.544 --> 25:49.005
Wow, okay. Not wasting any time, huh?

25:49.089 --> 25:52.509
Sorry, I'm socially awkward.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.843
Um...

25:53.927 --> 25:57.055
And have wanted to do that
for a while now.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.518
And would like to do it again.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.397
Um...

26:07.565 --> 26:08.400
Okay.

26:21.621 --> 26:25.375
<i>♪ I think she really likes me</i>
<i>Asked politely, can I--?</i>

27:53.463 --> 27:56.800
<i>I think a lot about</i>
<i>how the world treats teenage girls.</i>

27:56.883 --> 28:00.804
<i>Like, everything</i>
<i>that's good about us is a weakness.</i>

28:04.182 --> 28:06.893
<i>Our hearts, our emotions,</i>

28:06.976 --> 28:10.438
<i>our empathy,</i>
<i>means we need to be protected.</i>

28:14.651 --> 28:16.152
-How was your ride?
-Good.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.321
-Want me to drop you off at school?
-I'm good.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.239
Okay.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.408
<i>My whole family treats me</i>

28:21.491 --> 28:23.952
<i>like they know I have</i>
<i>all the potential in the world,</i>

28:24.035 --> 28:25.787
<i>but I have a lot to learn.</i>

28:26.329 --> 28:27.580
<i>Maybe both are true.</i>

28:28.373 --> 28:31.376
<i>All I know is I'm ready to prove</i>
<i>to them what I'm capable of.</i>

28:52.647 --> 28:54.107
<i>Week two in Savannah.</i>

28:54.858 --> 28:56.234
<i>It's not easy to make friends</i>

28:56.317 --> 28:59.237
<i>when you know you'll be</i>
<i>in a new city in a few months.</i>

28:59.320 --> 29:04.159
<i>So head up, shoulders back,</i>
<i>smile politely.</i>

29:04.242 --> 29:05.243
Thanks so much.

29:05.326 --> 29:08.913
<i>Every day, I just go through</i>
<i>the day so I can get back home,</i>

29:08.997 --> 29:12.709
<i>to the only place I feel normal.</i>
<i>With my family.</i>

29:18.131 --> 29:20.133
<i>When my parents first started hunting,</i>

29:20.675 --> 29:22.385
<i>I started having nightmares.</i>

29:23.636 --> 29:27.015
<i>For years, every time I'd close my eyes,</i>

29:27.724 --> 29:29.058
<i>I'd see monsters.</i>

29:30.393 --> 29:33.438
<i>Ones with claws as long as steak knives,</i>

29:34.105 --> 29:36.024
<i>teeth as sharp as glass.</i>

29:38.193 --> 29:41.196
<i>That was before I learned</i>
<i>the worst ones always look human.</i>

29:41.946 --> 29:44.324
<i>I learned that from JoJo when I was 3.</i>

29:44.407 --> 29:47.035
<i>She's the first Guild Guardian I ever met.</i>

29:47.118 --> 29:49.412
<i>My parents were on assignment</i>
<i>in Paris at the time.</i>

29:49.496 --> 29:51.623
<i>The Guardians were doing</i>
<i>what I've seen them do</i>

29:51.706 --> 29:53.041
<i>so many times now:</i>

29:53.124 --> 29:55.335
<i>warding off monsters and evil spirits</i>

29:55.418 --> 29:58.421
<i>with special candles, bunches of sage,</i>

29:58.505 --> 30:00.757
<i>and strategically-placed sea salt.</i>

30:00.840 --> 30:03.843
I don't know how I unpacked
all those boxes so quickly.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.845
Where do you wanna put this one?

30:06.846 --> 30:08.056
Right over here.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.314
-Yo, you ready?
-Yeah.

30:17.732 --> 30:21.778
A sequence
of important activities,

30:21.861 --> 30:25.740
gestures, words, and actions

30:25.824 --> 30:29.035
performed in a sequestered place.

30:29.118 --> 30:31.871
In other words,
get your narrow ass out my way

30:31.955 --> 30:33.665
so I can do my job right.

30:34.916 --> 30:35.750
Sorry.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.094
Assholes.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.099
Easy on the threshold.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.434
Hey!

30:54.811 --> 30:57.772
-Where you going?
-Got a tip, Calliope.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.232
From who?

30:59.816 --> 31:02.610
And saying my name like that
isn't gonna make me not wanna go.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.531
Out at Colonial Park Cemetery.
Get back in the house, we gotta go.

31:06.614 --> 31:07.991
Be back in a minute.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.202
No, we're not. Don't be ridiculous.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.413
It's gonna take a lot longer
than a minute.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.248
-You should be all set.
-Okay.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.876
It takes a few hours
for the wards to cure.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.044
So you keep your eyes open.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.421
I always do.

31:54.662 --> 31:56.873
-Why do you think they're showing up now?

31:57.332 --> 31:58.374
Who cares?

31:58.458 --> 32:01.252
The Guild sent us to kill them.
So we kill them.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.297
It's actually a great question, Cal.

32:04.380 --> 32:07.133
Good to know why you're doing
the things you're asked to do.

32:07.216 --> 32:10.011
We're monster hunters.
That's why we do what we do.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.182
But 25 years since the Guild
came through and cleaned up

32:14.265 --> 32:17.769
and now they're just back? Strange, right?

32:18.311 --> 32:20.313
It's strange it took them so long.

32:20.396 --> 32:22.231
Savannah's always tough to keep clean.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.442
All those battles, that bloodshed.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.611
Centuries of violence and betrayal.

32:26.694 --> 32:30.365
The cemetery we're going to now
dates back three centuries.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.909
Final resting place of over 10,000 souls,

32:32.992 --> 32:35.244
including victims
of the yellow fever epidemic

32:35.328 --> 32:37.872
and graves desecrated by Sherman's army.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.999
That's your big brother's way of saying

32:40.083 --> 32:42.126
you can't keep a good ghost down.

32:57.725 --> 33:00.937
<i>I spend a lot of time</i>
<i>pretending to be normal.</i>

33:01.688 --> 33:03.856
<i>Normal families go to the movies,</i>

33:03.940 --> 33:05.858
<i>have cookouts in the back yard.</i>

33:05.942 --> 33:08.736
<i>Go fishing. Take trips to Disneyland.</i>

33:10.071 --> 33:11.990
<i>We do this.</i>

33:15.076 --> 33:17.453
Said you got a tip. What kind of tip?

33:18.121 --> 33:22.250
Disturbed graves, exhumed bodies,
some very human-looking teeth.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.043
-So we're thinking--
-Ghouls.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.253
Yeah.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.298
Ghouls.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.219
I love them. They don't beg, don't plead.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.763
Don't ask a lot of questions.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.933
Hey, whoa. Uh-uh.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.018
I don't think so.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.064
Lookout? Again?

33:45.148 --> 33:47.650
-Lookout is a vital part of the job.
-Keeping you safe

33:47.734 --> 33:49.444
so Mom doesn't kill us.

33:49.527 --> 33:53.156
<i>One day, I'm going to be</i>
<i>the greatest hunter who ever lived.</i>

33:53.239 --> 33:56.534
<i>And these clowns will simply</i>
<i>be known as my brothers.</i>

33:56.617 --> 34:00.038
<i>Theo was 12 when he made his first kill</i>
<i>on a sweep with my dad.</i>

34:00.121 --> 34:01.330
Focus, son.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.624
You're running out of time.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.630
<i>And Apollo,</i>

34:09.714 --> 34:12.258
<i>he was 14 when he got his shot.</i>

34:15.762 --> 34:16.971
Pretty good, son.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.394
<i>Me? I got my first chance last winter.</i>

34:23.478 --> 34:25.146
<i>And I failed.</i>

34:25.897 --> 34:27.607
When am I gonna get another shot?

34:28.232 --> 34:29.776
It's up to Mom and Dad.

34:30.818 --> 34:33.863
Well, I'm at 19 kills
and I'd like to make it 20.

34:33.946 --> 34:36.532
-So let's hope there's actually some--

34:37.283 --> 34:38.701
You were saying?

34:40.411 --> 34:42.830
<i>So tonight, I'm the lookout.</i>

34:42.914 --> 34:43.831
<i>Again.</i>

34:44.457 --> 34:47.710
<i>Tasked with spotting monsters</i>
<i>because I once missed one.</i>

34:58.137 --> 35:00.181
When hunting monsters,
there are three rules.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.808
Pay attention to everything.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.393
Be prepared for anything.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.230
And always finish what you start.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.362
Got eyes, baby sis?

35:17.323 --> 35:19.992
Just clocked the first one.
May be a ghoul.

35:20.576 --> 35:21.953
Talk to me, Calliope.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.248
Clocked the second one, you got two.

35:25.331 --> 35:26.874
Good, we each get our own.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.336
Theo, you've got one two rows east,
three graves north.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.507
Apollo, yours is on the move, go left.

35:38.928 --> 35:39.762
Yo.

35:41.013 --> 35:42.640
Damn. You are ugly.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.105
-<i>See it, Theo?</i>
-Yep. About to go to work.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.783
-Aim for the head.
-Stop...

36:00.867 --> 36:02.368
backseat

36:02.451 --> 36:03.411
hunting.

36:05.663 --> 36:06.789
You're number 20, buddy.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.586
Theo, there's a third.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.088
Theo?

36:18.968 --> 36:21.721
<i>Theo? Do you hear me?</i>
<i>There's a third ghoul.</i>

36:24.098 --> 36:25.391
I'm coming in.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.352
Theo!

36:28.436 --> 36:30.479
-Theo!

36:32.732 --> 36:33.566
Hey!

36:38.279 --> 36:40.239
-Cal!
-Cal! Stand back!

36:40.323 --> 36:41.574
I got this!

36:42.533 --> 36:43.826
Cal!

36:53.461 --> 36:54.795
A damn vamp?

37:00.593 --> 37:02.762
Yeah, you definitely had it, huh?

37:02.845 --> 37:04.347
She looked like a ghoul.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.896
Mm-mm.
I better see some salad on there too.

37:13.189 --> 37:16.317
-So how'd it go?
-Oh, you know, I did my thing, so...

37:16.400 --> 37:19.570
two ghouls,
we disposed of them in short measure.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.406
And one vamp. It just came out of nowhere.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.826
Really? A vampire
in the same place as ghouls?

37:25.910 --> 37:29.330
Yeah, the way it came at me
was weird. Feral.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.375
-Good thing Cal clocked it.
-Oh, good job, baby.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.460
They didn't used to be so bold.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.712
I mean, even in Savannah.

37:36.796 --> 37:39.298
No wonder they sent us, huh?
We'll get rid of them.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.718
Love to finish a job before Pop gets home.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.470
He hates it when we do that.

37:46.722 --> 37:47.974
Can you pass the bread?

37:49.141 --> 37:51.644
<i>They keep telling me my time is coming.</i>

37:52.311 --> 37:54.438
<i>They don't understand that until it does,</i>

37:55.481 --> 37:57.733
<i>I won't feel like a member of this family.</i>

37:57.817 --> 38:00.194
Bam!
I stabbed it right in the chest, right?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.822
The thing slides down my sword
like meat on a skewer.

38:02.905 --> 38:04.198
-It was crazy.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.492
You should let me go train
at the Guild Academy right now.

38:06.575 --> 38:08.786
-Hey, Dad.
-<i>How's my girl?</i>

38:08.869 --> 38:10.788
<i>You keeping your brothers safe?</i>

38:10.871 --> 38:13.207
-I'm trying.
-And how's that new school?

38:13.291 --> 38:14.834
You make any friends yet?

38:14.917 --> 38:16.043
What's the point?

38:16.752 --> 38:19.130
-We'll be gone by Christmas.
<i>-I know, but...</i>

38:20.548 --> 38:23.009
it doesn't mean you shouldn't try, baby.

38:23.092 --> 38:26.137
You're 16 once, Cal.
You're allowed to have a life.

38:26.220 --> 38:28.139
This is my life, Dad.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.809
-If you let me show you.
-Your turn is coming, baby.

38:31.892 --> 38:32.893
Yeah, but--

38:37.606 --> 38:38.649
Hi, stranger.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.443
Hey, gorgeous.

38:40.526 --> 38:42.695
<i>As usual, we're gonna go over</i>
<i>our assignments,</i>

38:43.321 --> 38:45.865
<i>and as usual,</i>
<i>Apollo will complain about his.</i>

38:46.782 --> 38:49.744
<i>Okay, I'll let you handle it, babe.</i>
<i>See you soon.</i>

38:49.827 --> 38:51.787
All right, let's see what we got.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.917
Mm-mm. You have a job. It's called school.

38:59.462 --> 39:02.298
Stop looking for something
to be unhappy about, they're covers.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.592
Just covers? For who?

39:04.675 --> 39:07.678
I worked in that gym for six weeks.
Punched the clock every day.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.722
I'm sure the fact
it was on a college campus

39:09.805 --> 39:12.433
full of pretty girls had nothing to do
with your diligence.

39:13.017 --> 39:16.145
Oh. I'm a stay-at-home mother.

39:16.228 --> 39:17.146
Hmm.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.357
-Okay.
-Independent analyst.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.568
-What does that even mean?
-Whatever I need it to.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.613
Let's see.

39:26.947 --> 39:27.990
Oh, great.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.659
You've gotta be kidding me. A trainer.

39:30.743 --> 39:33.371
Again. Qualifications, good liar?

39:33.454 --> 39:35.706
Oh, yeah,
everybody can have a body like this.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.708
-This is some bullshit.
-Hey!

39:37.792 --> 39:39.710
You want me to lose my religion tonight?

39:39.794 --> 39:42.838
I know that's the adrenaline rush
from that kill talking.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.883
But you better watch your language
in my house. Hear me?

39:46.717 --> 39:48.594
Plus, it's not a bad cover.

39:48.677 --> 39:51.597
You get to talk about
your favorite subject all day. You.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.850
Mom, can I please tell him to go to hell?

39:54.934 --> 39:57.436
Sure, if you got somewhere else to live.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.646
All right.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.315
Here's to killing monsters.

40:09.949 --> 40:10.783
Damn.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.745
You're hot.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.084
-What's up?
-You're alive?

40:20.167 --> 40:22.920
-I was beginning to wonder.
-Just been busy.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.380
<i>You know how moving in can be.</i>

40:24.463 --> 40:26.257
Code for "I found another girl

40:26.340 --> 40:29.135
and spent my time making out with her
behind the gym"?

40:29.218 --> 40:30.803
-Yeah, right.
-You can tell me.

40:30.886 --> 40:33.013
-What are friends for?
<i>-And exes?</i>

40:33.097 --> 40:35.099
Come on, Cal. Who is she?

40:36.684 --> 40:37.810
<i>She's...</i>

40:39.228 --> 40:41.230
<i>-I don't know.</i>
<i>-You're feeling her.</i>

40:41.313 --> 40:43.691
-I'm not.
<i>-You used to be a better liar.</i>

40:50.906 --> 40:53.325
There was a moment,
but we don't have a lot in common.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.662
<i>Hate that. Straight girls</i>
<i>should come with a warning.</i>

40:57.455 --> 40:58.664
<i>You still in Philly?</i>

40:58.747 --> 41:01.041
No. Actually, I wanted to tell you.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.919
I did it. I got my first kill.

41:04.837 --> 41:07.965
Wow, that's... amazing.

41:08.883 --> 41:09.717
What was it like?

41:09.800 --> 41:11.886
<i>-I mean, like...</i>

41:11.969 --> 41:13.053
Uh--

41:13.137 --> 41:14.763
Sorry. Gotta go.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.892
Fam's planning a surprise celebration
they think I don't know about.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.560
Mom's calling to meet for dinner.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.021
<i>-I'll call you later, okay?</i>
-Okay. Yeah.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.523
<i>I'm from a lineage</i>
<i>thousands of years old.</i>

42:06.148 --> 42:09.652
<i>We're the best monster hunters</i>
<i>to ever walk the earth.</i>

42:09.735 --> 42:13.113
<i>And still, even though my family loves me,</i>

42:14.114 --> 42:18.369
<i>they always... always underestimate me.</i>

42:21.288 --> 42:23.123
<i>But don't you worry, Juliette.</i>

42:24.458 --> 42:26.335
<i>I won't underestimate you.</i>

42:29.588 --> 42:31.840
<i>Because there's a feeling you get</i>

42:31.924 --> 42:34.885
<i>when a monster's breath</i>
<i>eases up your nostrils.</i>

42:36.053 --> 42:38.639
<i>There's a warning prickle</i>
<i>on the back of your neck.</i>

42:39.598 --> 42:41.517
<i>So pretend all you want.</i>

42:41.600 --> 42:46.272
<i>Pretend to be kind, pretend to be gentle,</i>
<i>pretend to be human...</i>

42:48.524 --> 42:50.985
<i>but I know exactly what you are.</i>

42:52.027 --> 42:53.028
<i>A daywalker.</i>

42:54.280 --> 42:56.073
<i>Why else would you need these?</i>

42:57.825 --> 43:01.120
"Nearer, the plowed fields
curved and faded

43:01.203 --> 43:03.747
and the few hogs nosing in the furrows

43:03.831 --> 43:06.208
looked like large spotted stones."

43:20.097 --> 43:23.684
Setting is never just a backdrop
in a story. It's a character,

43:23.767 --> 43:26.020
often the first one we meet.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.440
It's important to note, then, the state...

43:42.494 --> 43:46.040
<i>My dad says that most hunters</i>
<i>just know a monster when they see one.</i>

44:13.317 --> 44:14.902
<i>You just didn't look like one,</i>

44:14.985 --> 44:17.237
<i>but you're the one they warned me about.</i>

44:18.489 --> 44:20.908
<i>The kind that leads with a smile.</i>

44:21.909 --> 44:22.993
<i>You're a monster.</i>

44:25.788 --> 44:27.039
<i>And I'm a hunter.</i>

44:33.003 --> 44:36.131
<i>And there's only one way this story ends.</i>

44:36.757 --> 44:37.716
Cheers.

44:52.690 --> 44:55.442
Wow, okay. Not wasting any time, huh?

44:55.526 --> 44:57.694
Sorry. I'm socially awkward.

44:57.778 --> 44:58.779
Um...

44:59.446 --> 45:02.449
And I've wanted to do that
for a while now.

45:03.617 --> 45:06.120
And would like to do it again?

45:08.705 --> 45:09.957
Um...

45:13.836 --> 45:14.962
Come on.

45:18.048 --> 45:21.051
<i>There are only three rules</i>
<i>for being a great hunter.</i>

45:22.094 --> 45:25.097
<i>There are only three rules</i>
<i>for your first kill.</i>

45:26.432 --> 45:27.558
<i>Stay calm.</i>

45:28.475 --> 45:30.060
<i>Keep your head on.</i>

45:30.894 --> 45:33.147
<i>Be prepared for anyone.</i>

45:34.106 --> 45:36.024
<i>Be prepared for anything.</i>

45:37.818 --> 45:39.319
<i>And always</i>

45:39.403 --> 45:41.947
<i>finish what you start.</i>
