WEBVTT

00:08.802 --> 00:12.472
Take this pink ribbon
off my eyes

00:12.597 --> 00:16.893
I'm exposed
and it's no big surprise

00:17.019 --> 00:20.897
Don't ya think I know
exactly where I stand

00:21.857 --> 00:26.319
This world is forcing me
to hold your hand

00:26.445 --> 00:30.073
'Cause I'm just a girl
Well, little old me

00:30.198 --> 00:34.786
Well don't let me
out of your sight

00:34.911 --> 00:37.289
Oh, I'm just a girl

00:37.414 --> 00:39.374
All pretty and petite

00:39.499 --> 00:44.129
So don't let me
have any rights

00:44.254 --> 00:49.468
Oh I've had it
up to here

00:53.138 --> 00:56.892
The moment that
I step outside

00:57.017 --> 01:01.146
So many reasons
for me to run and hide

01:01.271 --> 01:05.650
I can't do the little things
I hold so dear

01:05.776 --> 01:10.697
'Cause it's all those
little things that I fear

01:10.822 --> 01:14.868
'Cause I'm just a girl
I'd rather not be

01:14.993 --> 01:19.456
'Cause they won't let me
drive late at night

01:19.581 --> 01:23.752
Oh, I'm just a girl
Guess I'm some kind of freak

01:23.877 --> 01:28.715
'Cause they all sit
and stare with their eyes

01:28.840 --> 01:34.179
Oh, am I making myself clear

01:37.933 --> 01:42.104
I'm just a girl

01:42.229 --> 01:45.774
I'm just a girl in the world

01:45.899 --> 01:49.861
- How much is this, Lori?
- It's very expensive.

01:49.986 --> 01:51.947
It's very expensive.

01:52.072 --> 01:54.533
Look, I got money
to spend in here.

01:54.658 --> 01:59.538
I don't think we have anything for you.
You're obviously in the wrong place.

01:59.663 --> 02:01.707
Please leave.

02:01.832 --> 02:05.544
You know, even though we've watched
"Pretty Woman" like 36 times...

02:05.669 --> 02:09.464
- I never get tired of making fun of it.
- Oh, I know.

02:10.966 --> 02:14.636
Aww, poor thing. Look!
They won't let her shop.

02:14.761 --> 02:18.765
Yeah, like those salesgirls in Beverly
Hills aren't bigger whores than she is.

02:18.890 --> 02:20.809
I know!

02:22.394 --> 02:25.647
Oh, my God, listen to that
sad, sad music as she leaves.

02:26.481 --> 02:28.358
It's like, boo-hoo. Uhh.

02:30.861 --> 02:33.030
But it is actually
kind of sad.

02:36.450 --> 02:39.369
Anything you see here we can do, by the
way. Get ready to have some fun, okay?

02:39.494 --> 02:41.621
- Okay.
- Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Frances, Tovah.

02:41.747 --> 02:45.125
- Let's see it, come on! Let's see the outfit.
- How divine!

02:45.250 --> 02:47.961
Exactly how obscene-

02:48.086 --> 02:52.215
I just get really happy
when they finally let her shop.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.136
Okay, so I have
nothing to wear.

02:56.261 --> 02:58.930
We don't even have time to make
anything new before we go out.

02:59.056 --> 03:01.308
Well, what about this?

03:01.433 --> 03:05.979
- Did you lose weight? - Actually, I have
been trying this new fat-free diet I invented.

03:06.104 --> 03:10.025
All I've had to eat for the past six days
are Gummi Bears, jelly beans, and candy corns.

03:10.150 --> 03:13.737
God, I wish I had
your discipline.

03:13.862 --> 03:16.573
- This is it
- Work this

03:16.698 --> 03:18.825
- Diddy-bum diddy-bum pow
- Here it is

03:18.950 --> 03:21.578
I can't believe
how cute I look!

03:21.703 --> 03:25.749
I know! You know what? This is like
the cutest we've ever looked.

03:25.874 --> 03:29.461
Oh, it's definitely the cutest. Don't you
love how we can just say that to each other...

03:29.586 --> 03:32.047
- and we know that we're not being conceited?
- Oh, I know.

03:32.172 --> 03:35.175
No, we're just
being honest.

03:36.426 --> 03:38.804
- Be my lover, Wanna be my lover
- Lover

03:42.224 --> 03:45.644
Go ahead and take your time
Boy you gotta feel secure

03:45.769 --> 03:48.772
Before I make you mine
Baby you have to be sure

03:48.897 --> 03:52.317
You wanna be my lover
Wanna be my lover

03:52.442 --> 03:56.071
God. I hope some cute guys get here
tonight. They were cute last night.

03:56.196 --> 03:59.449
- Oh, they were cute.
- Really cute! - Oh!

03:59.574 --> 04:02.411
- Hey, Michele! Romy!
- We'll take two Diet Cokes?

04:02.536 --> 04:05.664
Right, with extra cherries.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

04:05.789 --> 04:11.044
Okay. I have the yuckiest taste
in my mouth from those taquitos.

04:11.169 --> 04:13.922
- Eeew.
- I hope I don't get indigestion.

04:14.047 --> 04:17.759
Hey, remember that time I barfed
from bad Mexican food? It was so gross.

04:17.884 --> 04:21.887
- Oh, my God, I hate throwing up in public.
- Me too! Ooh.

04:29.980 --> 04:33.108
I can't believe it. There are
absolutely no guys here tonight.

04:33.233 --> 04:35.569
I know. None.

04:35.694 --> 04:38.363
Come on, Michele, let's just
go dance with ourselves.

04:38.488 --> 04:40.407
Okay.

04:40.532 --> 04:42.409
Put your hands in the air

04:42.534 --> 04:45.245
'Cause there's a party over here
So grab yourself a beer

04:45.370 --> 04:48.665
And we could
get on with the world

04:48.790 --> 04:52.669
Swear to God.
Sometimes I wish I were a lesbian.

04:52.794 --> 04:56.173
You wanna try and have sex sometime?
Just to see if we are?

04:56.298 --> 05:00.719
What? Yeah, right, Michele. Just the thought
of having sex with another woman creeps me out.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.475
But if we're not married by
the time we're 30, ask me again.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.353
- Okay.
- Tell me can you feel the

05:09.478 --> 05:11.605
Masked girls comin'
with the fever, fever, fever

05:11.730 --> 05:16.068
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

05:16.193 --> 05:20.530
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

05:20.655 --> 05:25.077
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

05:25.202 --> 05:29.873
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

05:29.998 --> 05:34.044
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

05:34.169 --> 05:36.672
- Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
- Two-four-three.

05:36.797 --> 05:40.884
- Stayin' alive
- Two-four-three.

05:41.009 --> 05:43.303
Two-four-three.

05:44.930 --> 05:47.599
Two, four, three.

05:50.143 --> 05:52.979
Two, four, three.

05:53.105 --> 05:57.734
Service.
Number 243.

05:57.859 --> 05:59.736
It's beautiful.
Is that real wood?

05:59.861 --> 06:01.863
During this century, boys.

06:06.284 --> 06:10.288
Come on, Ramon. Quit jerking off
and bring the car around.

06:17.921 --> 06:22.092
- It's about time.
- Mm. Romy!

06:22.217 --> 06:25.012
You are looking hot today.

06:25.137 --> 06:28.265
Yeah. That's because
I'm sweating like a pig in here.

06:28.390 --> 06:31.143
Well, the air conditioning is
working in the service office.

06:31.268 --> 06:36.440
You might wanna come by
and, uh, cool off later?

06:36.565 --> 06:39.693
Yeah, Ramon.
That'll happen.

06:39.818 --> 06:43.363
Sorry, ma'am.
He is such an asshole.

06:43.488 --> 06:46.241
Mm.

06:46.366 --> 06:49.036
- I'm in a hurry.
- Well-

06:49.161 --> 06:54.791
I'm going as fast as I can,
Ms Mooney. Heather.

06:54.916 --> 06:57.127
Heather Mooney?

06:57.252 --> 06:59.421
From Sagebrush High
in Tucson?

07:01.465 --> 07:04.968
- Yeah?
- It's Romy!

07:05.093 --> 07:07.471
- Romy White!
- You're shittin' me.

07:07.596 --> 07:11.099
No, this is so weird. I didn't
know you were living in L. A.

07:11.224 --> 07:14.644
Well, now that you know, will
we be getting together a lot?

07:16.980 --> 07:19.941
So, God!
You're driving a new Jaguar?

07:20.067 --> 07:22.527
- What do you do?
- Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?

07:22.652 --> 07:26.615
- The ones that burn down real fast?
- "Twice the taste, in half the time, for the gal on the go"?

07:26.740 --> 07:30.911
I invented the
quick-burning paper.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.997
Wow!

07:34.122 --> 07:36.750
- You goin' to the reunion?
- What reunion?

07:36.875 --> 07:39.670
Our ten-year high school
reunion in Tucson?

07:39.795 --> 07:43.340
You're kidding me. It's been
ten years since high school?

07:43.465 --> 07:48.095
- God. Where have I been?
- I'm stumped. Where?

07:48.220 --> 07:51.682
- Anyway, are you going?
- I'd rather put this out in my ass.

07:53.517 --> 07:55.727
I wonder why we didn't
get an invitation.

07:55.852 --> 07:58.522
I mean, I'm sure Michele would
have told me if she got one.

07:58.647 --> 08:00.816
- Michele Weinberger?
- Mm-hmm.

08:02.484 --> 08:05.028
- Do you live with Michele Weinberger?
- Yeah.

08:07.823 --> 08:10.117
I just thought maybe she'd
be married to Sandy by now.

08:10.242 --> 08:12.786
- Sandy Frink?
- Yes, Sandy Frink.

08:12.911 --> 08:15.122
He could barely contain his erection
every time she was around.

08:15.247 --> 08:18.291
Why do you think he always
carried that huge notebook?

08:18.417 --> 08:21.420
The Frink-a-zoid
and Michele, I am sure.

08:21.545 --> 08:25.507
Besides, didn't you have a thing
for Sandy in high school?

08:25.632 --> 08:30.762
I did not have a "thing. " I did not have
a "thing. " I did not have a "thing. "

08:30.887 --> 08:32.847
I was very much
in love with him.

08:32.972 --> 08:35.308
Very much in love,
and there's a difference.

08:36.893 --> 08:39.895
There's a difference.

08:40.022 --> 08:41.898
There's a difference.

08:44.025 --> 08:46.236
I have to go now.

08:48.363 --> 08:52.909
Well! I guess I won't be
seeing you at the reunion.

08:53.035 --> 08:55.287
- But I'll tell everyone you said "hi. "
- Why don't you tell everyone...

08:55.412 --> 08:58.957
I said to go fuck themselves, for making
my teen years a living hell?

08:59.082 --> 09:00.709
Oh, yeah, right!

09:03.920 --> 09:07.007
Finally-

09:08.675 --> 09:12.971
Michele. You will never guess
who I just ran into.

09:15.265 --> 09:18.935
- God, I cannot believe it's already been ten years.
- I know.

09:19.061 --> 09:21.563
- Oh. - You know...
- There she is.

09:21.688 --> 09:25.192
Oh! God,
she was so weird.

09:25.317 --> 09:28.528
- She still is.
- Why was she, like, always going behind that building?

09:36.787 --> 09:40.624
It was long ago

09:40.749 --> 09:44.628
Seems like yesterday

09:44.753 --> 09:48.590
Saw you standin' in the rain

09:48.715 --> 09:52.552
- Then I heard you say
- Got a light?

09:52.678 --> 09:56.556
- I want your love But it comes out wrong
- Thank you.

09:56.682 --> 10:00.727
- I want to live, but I don't belong
- Thank you! Thank you, I really appreciate that...

10:00.852 --> 10:04.147
because I'm not a human being
or anything, you pathetic turd!

10:04.272 --> 10:11.405
Blood and roses
Blood and roses

10:11.530 --> 10:14.991
Blood and roses

10:15.117 --> 10:20.080
- Roses, roses
- There should be a cigarette you could smoke all the way through between classes.

10:20.205 --> 10:22.874
What a waste.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.169
- Okay. - Find
us. - Oh. Okay.

10:28.088 --> 10:30.298
Oh, my God, do you remember
what a big controversy it was...

10:30.424 --> 10:34.011
for us to have our
picture taken together?

10:34.136 --> 10:38.015
Yeah, well, Danny Weller, like,
"lodged the complaint," and, you know-

10:38.140 --> 10:41.518
'Cause, "alphabetically,
he's supposed to be between us. "

10:43.353 --> 10:46.648
And then we said, "Okay, Danny.
If you want to be between us...

10:46.773 --> 10:49.776
you can come to Michele's house on
Friday night, and we'll be waiting. "

10:49.901 --> 10:51.987
That's right. He came over and
we're like, "Danny, it was a joke. "

10:52.112 --> 10:54.823
I know! And then we turned
the sprinklers on him!

10:56.908 --> 11:00.787
Oh, my God.
Didn't he die?

11:02.497 --> 11:04.458
- I think so.
- Yeah.

11:07.169 --> 11:10.797
- Oh, my God. Michele. Look
at the "A" group. - Mm-hmm.

11:10.922 --> 11:13.383
Christie Masters,
Kelly Possenger...

11:13.508 --> 11:15.802
Lisa Luder
and Cheryl Quick.

11:17.679 --> 11:20.724
So, who would you say
was in the "B" group?

11:20.849 --> 11:23.852
Oh. The drama crowd. You know,
like Casey Degan and Mark Black.

11:23.977 --> 11:28.357
- Uh-huh. God, I had the hugest
crush on Casey. 'Member? - Oh, yeah.

11:28.482 --> 11:30.359
God, I wonder why
he never liked me.

11:31.943 --> 11:34.988
Young man, there's
no need to feel down

11:35.113 --> 11:37.074
I said, young man-

11:37.199 --> 11:39.743
So, what group would
you say we were in?

11:39.868 --> 11:42.412
Well, we definitely
weren't in the "A" group.

11:42.537 --> 11:45.540
But you know what? We weren't
really in the "B" group, either.

11:45.666 --> 11:47.793
Okay, we weren't in
the "C" group, were we?

11:47.918 --> 11:51.755
What? Oh, no. Michele, come on. I mean, that
was like, all the honour students and like...

11:51.880 --> 11:54.508
the rejects; you know, like
Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.

11:54.633 --> 11:58.011
- Eeew, look at them.
- We were definitely not in that group.

11:58.136 --> 12:00.597
- Ecch.
- She blinded me with Science

12:00.722 --> 12:04.768
Michele! Oh, Michele.
Over here!

12:04.893 --> 12:06.770
Want me to get your
huge notebook for you?

12:06.895 --> 12:10.524
Oh! Heather! I wanna take another picture
of you and Sandy for the yearbook and-

12:10.649 --> 12:12.609
Oh! I wanna
interview you too...

12:12.734 --> 12:15.320
because I think it would make a really
interesting article for the "Roundup. "

12:15.445 --> 12:18.115
Ohh, Toby! Fuck off.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.617
Okay. But can I take
a picture of you first?

12:22.786 --> 12:24.788
So, Romy, what group
were we in?

12:26.039 --> 12:29.001
Well, you know, I'm not sure that
we were really in any group.

12:29.126 --> 12:31.962
I think maybe we were
more like loners.

12:33.380 --> 12:36.383
- Oh, my God! There we are!
- Yeah, and alone. Look.

12:36.508 --> 12:39.845
You know, even though I had to wear that
stupid back brace, and you were kinda fat...

12:39.970 --> 12:41.847
we were still totally
cutting edge.

12:41.972 --> 12:45.100
- I love it when it's hamburger day.
- Uh-huh.

12:45.225 --> 12:49.646
Okay, smile! Great!
Thanks a lot!

12:49.771 --> 12:52.983
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, please. - Hello, girls.

12:53.108 --> 12:56.111
Don't forget, you have
detention after school today.

12:56.236 --> 13:00.282
- Oh, we won't, Mr Lish.
- Yeah, we're really looking forward to it.

13:06.121 --> 13:09.166
- God!
- Can you believe he just got married?

13:09.291 --> 13:14.379
- Like, how desperate is she?
- I know, it's like: "Hi. This is my husband.

13:14.504 --> 13:17.883
He dissects crayfish, but he
has a really good personality. "

13:18.008 --> 13:22.429
He's the kind of man
that I desire

13:22.554 --> 13:27.059
Sets the summer sun
on fire

13:27.184 --> 13:31.229
- I want candy
- Oh, my God.

13:31.355 --> 13:36.193
- I want candy
- Michele. Billy Christianson.

13:36.318 --> 13:39.780
- Oh, he's so cute. - He
is cute. - Really cute.

13:44.117 --> 13:48.413
- Hey - Hi,
Billy. - Hey

13:48.538 --> 13:50.540
Hey

13:50.666 --> 13:52.626
Hey

13:52.751 --> 13:55.128
- Hey
- Ow! Billy!

13:55.253 --> 13:59.049
Oh, Billy, gosh,
you're so slimy.

13:59.174 --> 14:02.678
I cannot believe he's
with Christie Masters.

14:02.803 --> 14:05.722
I know. She is, like,
so transparent.

14:05.847 --> 14:07.849
Did you hear her report
in Miss Weigatt's class?

14:07.974 --> 14:12.145
She actually thinks she's gonna be a
TV anchorwoman. What a "deludanoid. "

14:15.107 --> 14:17.734
Those weirdos are
staring at us again.

14:17.859 --> 14:20.821
- They're obsessed with us.
- Look at what they're wearing.

14:20.946 --> 14:23.490
Where do you even get
outfits that hideous?

14:23.615 --> 14:26.535
They made them in Home Ec
from their own patterns.

14:26.660 --> 14:29.204
Actually, I think
they're semi-interesting.

14:33.458 --> 14:37.546
In a freakish, off-putting
sort of way. Never mind.

14:37.671 --> 14:39.548
- Christie. - Uh. -
Come on, I'm hungry.

14:39.673 --> 14:42.509
No, Billy. Wait.
I wanna have some fun.

14:42.634 --> 14:45.554
Lisa, gimme the bag.

14:49.474 --> 14:53.729
Here you go.
You are so bad.

14:55.689 --> 14:58.734
- What? What?
- She is out of control.

15:01.319 --> 15:06.033
Michele? Christie Masters
is coming over here.

15:06.158 --> 15:10.037
- Wow. She never comes over.
- Okay, just act cool.

15:14.166 --> 15:17.544
- Hi. - Hi. -
Hi, Christie.

15:17.669 --> 15:22.507
- So. You girls gonna try out for the spring musical?
- Us?

15:22.632 --> 15:27.137
Yeah, you should.
It'll be fun.

15:29.014 --> 15:33.310
- Okay. Why not?
- Yeah. So, um, what musical are they doing?

15:33.435 --> 15:36.480
- "The Music Man. "
- You're kidding!

15:36.605 --> 15:40.150
Oh, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-comin' down the street

15:40.275 --> 15:43.111
I love "The Music Man. "

15:43.236 --> 15:47.991
Okay. Can I have
the rest of this?

15:48.116 --> 15:51.662
Um, w-

15:51.787 --> 15:54.665
Mm. It's good.

15:57.459 --> 16:00.837
See ya!

16:00.962 --> 16:04.257
She can be really nice
when she wants to be.

16:05.384 --> 16:07.260
Michele!

16:09.513 --> 16:14.184
- Uh-oh. Don't look now. Here come the
Frink-a-zoid. - Oh, God! He is such a geek!

16:14.309 --> 16:18.522
Hi, Michele. Gee, Michele,
you're looking really lovely today.

16:20.148 --> 16:22.818
Okay. See you in Biology.

16:24.903 --> 16:28.156
I- I-I thought I ought
to tell you, Michele, that...

16:28.281 --> 16:32.786
Christie Masters stuck
magnets on your back.

16:32.911 --> 16:34.830
- What?
- She stuck-

16:34.955 --> 16:37.040
Michele, you do have
magnets on your back!

16:37.165 --> 16:40.210
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16:40.335 --> 16:42.713
Oh, my God.
Help me.

16:42.838 --> 16:44.715
Oh, my God.

16:47.384 --> 16:50.012
Oh, don't let them see you get upset.
That's what they want.

16:50.887 --> 16:54.558
Oh, my God.

16:54.683 --> 16:57.519
- Hey!
- I'm pretending you just did something hilarious.

16:57.644 --> 16:59.896
Now, you laugh at me.
Come on, do it.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:12.367 --> 17:16.621
God, that was so rude. I mean, you
couldn't help it if you had scoliosis.

17:16.747 --> 17:22.002
I know. And what a bitch, taking
your hamburger. I mean, what was that?

17:22.794 --> 17:27.007
God, remember the prom?
You got so thin by then.

17:27.089 --> 17:32.679
Oh, I know. I was so lucky, getting
mono. That was, like, the best diet ever.

17:32.804 --> 17:36.641
I wonder, if I had gotten my brace off
sooner, if somebody would have invited me.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.977
I mean, other
than Sandy Frink.

17:39.102 --> 17:41.271
Well, nobody
invited me either.

17:41.396 --> 17:46.735
Well, at least we looked fantastic,
and that is the most important thing.

17:46.860 --> 17:51.573
- We were cool on craze
- Oh, gee. Nice outfits. Really.

17:51.698 --> 17:55.869
- When I, you - Oh, look, it's the
Madonna twins. - And everyone we knew

17:55.994 --> 18:00.999
Could believe, do, and share
in what was true, Oh, I said

18:01.124 --> 18:03.794
Okay, this is so typical.
Of course, we're like the only ones...

18:03.919 --> 18:06.046
who don't look like
we're going to a hoedown.

18:06.171 --> 18:09.341
- Oh, I know. This town is like so unhip.
- Ecch.

18:09.466 --> 18:13.053
- I can't wait till we move to L. A.
- Me too!

18:13.178 --> 18:16.807
Everything's gonna happen for us there,
Michele, and we'll never look back.

18:16.932 --> 18:19.726
- Okay.
- Dance hall days

18:23.271 --> 18:26.108
- Dance hall days
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

18:26.233 --> 18:28.402
That hurt.
But it looked really good.

18:28.527 --> 18:30.487
Dance hall days

18:30.612 --> 18:32.489
Oh, everybody!

18:32.614 --> 18:34.991
- Dance hall, dance hall days
- Okay, everyone.

18:35.117 --> 18:38.870
Uh, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

18:38.996 --> 18:42.666
It's time to announce
the king and queen of the prom.

18:42.791 --> 18:45.877
- Ahh!
- And the winners are...

18:50.465 --> 18:53.719
Billy Christianson
and Christie Masters!

18:53.844 --> 18:57.222
Ohh! Ohh!

18:57.347 --> 19:00.809
- Duh.
- Oh, it's me!

19:04.062 --> 19:06.231
Boo-hoo!
I'm so surprised!

19:06.356 --> 19:08.650
Thank you. Thank you.

19:08.775 --> 19:11.194
God, Billy looks
cute in his tux.

19:11.319 --> 19:13.822
- He does look cute.
- Really cute.

19:17.075 --> 19:21.330
Do you think, since it's the last night of
school and I might never see him again...

19:21.455 --> 19:24.708
that maybe he would
dance with me?

19:24.833 --> 19:27.544
I bet he would.
I mean, it's senior prom.

19:27.669 --> 19:30.047
Nobody's going to say "no"
to anyone tonight.

19:39.639 --> 19:44.561
Michele, since this is the
last night of school and all...

19:44.686 --> 19:47.689
would you care
to dance with me once?

19:47.814 --> 19:49.983
No.

19:52.152 --> 19:55.739
I'll dance with you.

19:55.864 --> 20:00.243
Nah. It's no fun unless
you really love the person.

20:02.663 --> 20:05.540
Thanks, anyway.

20:05.666 --> 20:08.293
Okay. Who can name the capitals
of all the 50 states?

20:08.418 --> 20:11.421
Okay, Toby. Fuck off.

20:11.546 --> 20:15.842
Heather! Can't you be
a little bit more sensitive?

20:15.967 --> 20:19.930
Me? Me? Me be
more sensitive?

20:20.055 --> 20:21.932
You are a jerk-off!

20:22.057 --> 20:26.144
Another kiss
is what it takes

20:26.269 --> 20:28.271
- Albuquerque.
- You can't sleep

20:28.397 --> 20:30.273
- You can't eat
- Albany.

20:30.399 --> 20:32.442
There's no doubt

20:32.567 --> 20:34.569
You're in deep

20:34.695 --> 20:38.824
Your throat is tight
You can't breathe

20:38.949 --> 20:43.453
Another kiss is all you need
Whoa-oh-ohh

20:43.578 --> 20:46.873
- Why are you tormenting me?
- You like to think you're immune to the stuff

20:46.999 --> 20:52.212
- Why don't you go fuck a sheep or your sister or yourself?
- Oh, yeah

20:52.337 --> 20:54.840
Brain-dead
redneck asshole!

20:54.965 --> 20:58.218
Can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it

20:58.343 --> 21:02.347
You're addicted to love
You see the signs

21:02.472 --> 21:04.683
But you can't read

21:04.808 --> 21:08.895
You're runnin' at
a different speed

21:09.021 --> 21:13.233
Your heart beats
in double time

21:13.358 --> 21:15.569
- Another kiss
- Um, Billy?

21:15.694 --> 21:17.571
- And you'll be mine
- Hi.

21:17.696 --> 21:22.034
- A one-track mind, you can't be saved
- Do you wanna dance?

21:22.159 --> 21:25.495
- Oblivion is all you crave
- I mean, it's just 'cause...

21:25.620 --> 21:28.457
this song is,
like, so great.

21:28.582 --> 21:31.168
Mm. Never mind.

21:31.293 --> 21:34.504
Unless, you know,
you want to.

21:34.629 --> 21:37.049
- Whoa, you like to think
- Yeah. I mean-

21:37.174 --> 21:39.176
- That you're immune to this stuff
- Y-Y- Sure. Why not?

21:39.301 --> 21:43.680
- Oh, yeah -
Really? - Wh- Um-

21:43.805 --> 21:45.682
- It's closer to the truth
- Could you wait here?

21:45.807 --> 21:48.477
- To say you can't get enough -
I- I-I'll be right back. - Okay.

21:48.602 --> 21:52.481
- Okay.
- You know, you're gonna have to face it You're addicted to love

21:52.606 --> 21:56.568
Might as well face it
You're addicted to love

21:56.693 --> 21:58.570
- Might as well face it
- Hey, Christie.

21:58.695 --> 22:02.199
- You're addicted to love
- That Romy girl just asked me to dance with her.

22:02.324 --> 22:05.786
- Might as well face it
- Oh, you're kidding me! Oh, that's pathetic!

22:05.911 --> 22:10.207
- Might as well face it
- W-W-W-What should I do?

22:10.332 --> 22:12.417
Let me take care of this.

22:18.131 --> 22:21.385
- Michele?
- Oh, God. Okay, so what did he say?

22:21.510 --> 22:24.471
- "Sure. Why not?"
- Oh, my God!

22:28.767 --> 22:31.687
- Thanks a lot, Romy.
- What?

22:31.812 --> 22:33.855
Thanks for stealing
my boyfriend.

22:33.980 --> 22:37.317
- What are you talking about?
- Billy just broke up with me.

22:37.442 --> 22:40.112
Apparently he's had a crush on
you since Mr Roswell's class.

22:40.237 --> 22:44.741
And now that he knows that you like him, he
doesn't want to "pretend" with me any more.

22:44.866 --> 22:48.453
My life was perfect
and you've ruined it.

22:48.578 --> 22:51.415
Go for it
Groove ahead

22:51.540 --> 22:54.459
I swear to God, Christie,
I didn't even think he'd dance with me.

22:54.584 --> 22:58.422
- To whip it, Whip it good
- Wow. She is really P. O.'d.

22:58.547 --> 23:02.175
- This is so cool!
- Oh, I know.

23:02.300 --> 23:06.346
You know what is so weird? I had this
dream, where Billy was like, in love with me.

23:06.471 --> 23:10.308
And I mean, he was in a wheelchair, but
still, it's like it's coming true or something!

23:10.434 --> 23:12.728
- Uh-huh.
- How's my hair?

23:12.853 --> 23:15.814
Perfect. Okay, Romy, you look so
good with blonde hair and black roots.

23:15.939 --> 23:19.109
- It's like, not even funny.
- I have to say...

23:19.234 --> 23:23.113
this is turning out to be one of
the very best nights of my entire life.

23:23.238 --> 23:25.365
Yay, yay!

23:38.837 --> 23:43.258
Lyin' in my bed I hear
the clock tick

23:43.383 --> 23:45.802
And think of you

23:45.927 --> 23:48.889
Caught up in circles

23:49.014 --> 23:53.101
Confusion is nothing new

23:53.226 --> 23:56.980
Flashback to warm nights

23:57.105 --> 24:00.484
Almost left behind

24:00.609 --> 24:04.488
- Suitcase of memories
- You know, maybe he's, like, passed out in the bathroom.

24:04.613 --> 24:06.490
- You want me to go check?
- Time after, Sometimes

24:06.615 --> 24:09.785
- You picture me
- He's not in the bathroom, Michele.

24:09.910 --> 24:13.288
I'm walkin' too far ahead

24:13.413 --> 24:16.416
- I'll dance with you, Romy.
- You're callin' to me

24:16.541 --> 24:20.545
- I can't hear what
you've said - Okay. - Okay.

24:20.671 --> 24:24.758
Then you say "Go slow"

24:24.883 --> 24:28.261
I fall behind

24:28.387 --> 24:31.139
The second hand unwinds

24:31.264 --> 24:35.936
If you're lost you can look
and you will find me

24:36.061 --> 24:38.480
Time after time

24:38.605 --> 24:43.193
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

24:43.318 --> 24:45.696
Time after time

24:45.821 --> 24:50.575
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

24:50.701 --> 24:53.203
Time after time

24:53.328 --> 24:57.958
- If you fall, I will catch you I'll be waiting
- I will be waiting

24:58.083 --> 25:01.586
Time after time

25:01.712 --> 25:03.588
Time after time

25:03.714 --> 25:05.882
We just waited and waited.

25:06.008 --> 25:10.053
- God, I was such an idiot.
- But wait till he sees you now.

25:10.178 --> 25:12.973
You are so much cuter
than you were in high school.

25:13.098 --> 25:15.892
- I guess I'm cuter.
- Yeah!

25:16.018 --> 25:19.396
And look at the way we live.
I mean, just our lifestyle.

25:19.521 --> 25:22.774
You know, I mean, we live in L. A,
and they are still stuck in Tucson.

25:26.069 --> 25:30.073
You know what, Michele?
You're right.

25:30.198 --> 25:33.118
We are gonna go back there
and blow them away.

25:37.205 --> 25:40.625
Boy, there's a lot of questions to
answer. Why do we have to fill these out?

25:40.751 --> 25:43.337
They wanna know what we've been
doing for the past ten years.

25:43.462 --> 25:47.841
- Oh!
- Okay. Here we go.

25:47.966 --> 25:49.926
- Ahh!
- "Name. "

25:50.052 --> 25:53.513
- Ah! We're having so much fun already.
- Oh, I know!

25:53.638 --> 25:56.850
- I cannot wait for this reunion.
- Me too!

25:58.810 --> 26:01.313
"Occupation. "
Cashier.

26:01.438 --> 26:04.775
- Unemployed.
- No. Don't write that.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.694
Um, okay, so your last job
was as a salesgirl?

26:07.819 --> 26:12.407
- So say you're a freelance fashion consultant.
- Ooh! Clever.

26:12.532 --> 26:15.661
"Relationship Status. "
Married.

26:15.786 --> 26:19.289
- Nope. -
Engaged? - No.

26:19.414 --> 26:23.210
- Living with someone?
- Should I say you?

26:23.335 --> 26:25.379
- I guess so.
- Okay.

26:30.217 --> 26:33.220
- You know, Michele?
- Yeah?

26:33.345 --> 26:36.431
- Now that I'm looking at this...
- Uh-huh?

26:36.556 --> 26:39.726
our lives don't seem as
impressive as I thought.

26:39.851 --> 26:42.145
- They don't?
- Well, do you think it's impressive...

26:42.270 --> 26:45.565
that we're still single, and we've
been living together for ten years...

26:45.691 --> 26:48.819
and I'm a cashier
and you're unemployed?

26:48.944 --> 26:51.196
Well, not super impressive.

26:51.321 --> 26:54.700
Well, then, what's the point of going
if we're not going to impress people?

26:54.825 --> 26:58.787
Well- Uh.

27:06.545 --> 27:09.006
Romy, I still really,
really, really want to go.

27:09.131 --> 27:14.803
- I know. Me too.
- Well then, can't we just, like, think of something?

27:14.928 --> 27:20.600
- Okay. Well, the reunion is still like two weeks away, right?
- Right.

27:20.726 --> 27:25.147
And all we really need is maybe some,
like, better jobs and boyfriends. Right?

27:25.272 --> 27:27.691
Yeah!

27:27.816 --> 27:32.320
But, okay. If those things were so easy
to get, wouldn't we already have them?

27:32.446 --> 27:34.364
Well, I mean, we never
really tried before.

27:34.489 --> 27:38.201
I mean, we never really had a good enough
reason, like going to a reunion, to motivate us.

27:38.327 --> 27:40.245
That's true.

27:40.370 --> 27:44.916
Okay. So we're just gonna have to make
ourselves more impressive, that's all.

27:45.042 --> 27:48.879
So I'm gonna go out and bag us some boyfriends,
while you can look for a cool new job.

27:49.004 --> 27:51.423
- Okay.
- Plus, I hate to say it...

27:51.548 --> 27:53.508
but I really think that
we should lose some weight.

27:53.633 --> 27:55.510
Oh.

27:58.555 --> 28:01.266
Oh. Unh.

28:01.391 --> 28:04.978
Okay. I don't think that, like,
one chip makes a difference.

28:05.103 --> 28:07.272
It wasn't even
a whole chip.

28:15.906 --> 28:20.994
All right. According to this chart,
if we want to lose a pound a day...

28:21.119 --> 28:23.580
we have to burn twice
as many calories as we eat.

28:23.705 --> 28:27.876
So, that means, if we want
to burn 4,000 calories...

28:29.294 --> 28:31.338
we only have to run
20 miles a day!

28:31.463 --> 28:34.800
Oh! Hey, Romy, remember
Mrs Chivas' class?

28:34.925 --> 28:36.968
There was, like,
always a word problem.

28:37.094 --> 28:39.346
Like, there's a guy in
a rowboat going "X" miles...

28:39.471 --> 28:42.933
and the current is going, like,
you know, some... other miles...

28:43.058 --> 28:45.769
and, how long does it take him
to get to town?

28:45.894 --> 28:50.565
It was like, who cares? Who wants to go
to town with a guy who drives a rowboat?

28:50.691 --> 28:53.360
Okay, guys, let's jump.

28:56.947 --> 29:00.742
- Hey, Michele? - Yeah? -
What does this remind you of?

29:00.867 --> 29:03.578
Well, I know.
This lady is totally sick.

29:10.919 --> 29:12.963
Uh, lemme just
say that, um...

29:13.088 --> 29:16.508
I am, like, really familiar with the entire
Versace line, and if you would just...

29:16.633 --> 29:22.055
give me a chance, I know I could,
like, sell the shit out of the stuff.

29:22.180 --> 29:26.560
And, uh, to me,
fashion is just, it's like...

29:26.685 --> 29:29.396
everything. It's-

29:29.521 --> 29:32.941
By the way, that blouse- Hi.
That blouse looks great on you.

29:33.066 --> 29:36.987
- Oh! Thank you!
- And see, I make a great salesperson...

29:37.112 --> 29:39.239
'cause I just have this,
like, really believable way...

29:39.364 --> 29:43.618
of telling people that they look really
good, even though I'm just, like, you know-

29:48.790 --> 29:52.002
I think
she heard me.

29:52.127 --> 29:55.255
Thank you so much
for coming.

29:55.380 --> 29:59.801
- That's okay, you're welcome.
- I don't think we'll be requiring any new staff.

29:59.926 --> 30:02.971
- You aren't taking on any what?
- Staff. Employees.

30:03.096 --> 30:05.307
Ohh! Oh, "staff. "

30:05.432 --> 30:08.185
Okay, I didn't understand
with your big accent.

30:08.310 --> 30:11.355
I couldn't
figure it out. Okay.

30:13.690 --> 30:17.569
Fine. You know, you really shouldn't
let people fill out applications...

30:17.694 --> 30:22.199
if you don't want them to
actually try to get a job here.

30:22.324 --> 30:27.287
- It's a compli- - No, no. That's
all I have to say. - Goodbye.

30:27.412 --> 30:30.415
If there ain't no love
then there ain't no use

30:30.540 --> 30:34.044
Ooh, better walk on by
Better walk on through

30:34.169 --> 30:39.091
Hi. Hey, um, great suit.
Is that an Armani?

30:39.216 --> 30:43.845
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- I thought so. So, what do you do?

30:43.970 --> 30:47.057
- I'm a suit salesman.
- Oh, uh-oh

30:47.182 --> 30:52.020
Would you excuse me? I cut my foot before,
and my shoe is filling up with blood.

30:53.522 --> 30:56.608
Ooh, if there ain't no love
then there ain't no use

30:56.733 --> 31:00.445
Ooh, better walk on by
Better walk on through

31:00.570 --> 31:04.241
Hey, hey, there's a woman in the world
that you can't use

31:07.369 --> 31:11.790
Ain't no love, Ain't no use
Ain't no love

31:11.915 --> 31:17.504
Yeah, well, my first choice was to work at a
boutique on Rodeo Drive, but this would be okay.

31:17.629 --> 31:21.883
Well, thank you. Unfortunately, we
don't have any openings here right now.

31:22.009 --> 31:23.885
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

31:24.011 --> 31:28.432
Although we might have
an opening at our discount outlet.

31:28.557 --> 31:31.685
Okay, well, what street
would that be on?

31:53.081 --> 31:58.795
Come on, Michele. At this point,
any job is better than no job at all.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.631
A discount outlet? Me?

32:03.550 --> 32:05.802
Fine.

32:05.927 --> 32:08.513
So, any boyfriends yet?

32:08.638 --> 32:14.102
No. All the guys with good jobs
must be going to some other club.

32:14.227 --> 32:18.106
Oh, you know where Dana met her new
boyfriend? He's a William Morris agent.

32:18.231 --> 32:22.027
Oh! Showbiz!
Good job! Where?

32:23.612 --> 32:26.990
Hi. My name is Romy,
and I'm an alcoholic.

32:27.115 --> 32:31.078
- Hi, Romy!
- Hey.

32:31.203 --> 32:34.790
And you also get a five-percent
employee discount...

32:34.915 --> 32:37.501
over and above our
everyday low prices.

32:37.626 --> 32:41.380
You could make curtains
for the motorhome with this.

32:41.505 --> 32:45.717
- I got this tie for a dollar.
- You paid a whole dollar for that?

32:45.842 --> 32:48.637
- You betcha.
- Ah!

32:54.101 --> 32:56.687
She's one
of our regulars.

32:58.689 --> 33:02.734
So, what do you think?

33:02.859 --> 33:05.696
I- I'd like to go away.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.460
I know I'm supposed to wait
in that line, but listen.

33:20.585 --> 33:24.548
I wouldn't even be here if this
weren't, like, a dating emergency.

33:24.673 --> 33:29.011
Our cutoff is 25.
Try VH-1.

33:48.655 --> 33:53.577
The reunion's less than a week away. I mean,
I just can't believe you turned down a job.

33:53.702 --> 33:56.246
Well, I thought the idea
was to impress people.

33:56.371 --> 34:01.043
I mean, how am I going to impress anyone
by selling Ban-Lon smocks at Bargain Mart?

34:05.005 --> 34:07.758
I'm sick of this.
I'm gonna go weigh myself.

34:19.561 --> 34:25.359
Oh, God! I've been killing myself
for eight days and I gained a pound.

34:25.484 --> 34:29.987
That's impossible! Did you
deduct 16 pounds for your shoes?

34:30.112 --> 34:33.367
Just forget it.
I'm not going.

34:33.492 --> 34:37.371
- What?
- Come on. Get real, Michele. We're idiots.

34:37.496 --> 34:42.668
We can't get jobs and boyfriends,
and lose weight, in two weeks.

34:42.793 --> 34:45.379
But I thought
you said we could.

35:11.071 --> 35:15.409
Wow. God, the top female
executives are all so pretty.

35:17.619 --> 35:21.331
Those aren't the actual executives,
Michele. Those are models.

35:21.456 --> 35:24.126
Oh, I thought
they looked familiar.

35:24.251 --> 35:27.546
God, they really look like
executives, don't they?

35:27.671 --> 35:29.715
That's only because they're
wearing those stupid suits...

35:29.840 --> 35:32.759
and phoney glasses,
and carrying briefcases.

35:32.884 --> 35:38.348
- Huh!
- Oh, my God, Michele, that's it!

35:38.473 --> 35:41.518
We can go to the reunion, and
just pretend to be successful!

35:41.643 --> 35:43.895
I mean, who's gonna know?
They're in Tucson, we're here.

35:44.021 --> 35:46.481
We could just show up
looking like businesswomen.

35:46.606 --> 35:49.860
Oh, my God!
Oh!

35:49.985 --> 35:54.031
Wait. Ohh. But if the people at the
reunion see us drive up in a Nova...

35:54.156 --> 35:56.950
won't they know we're not
really businesswomen?

35:57.075 --> 35:59.703
If you can make us
the clothes...

35:59.828 --> 36:02.789
I can get us the car.

36:15.677 --> 36:19.806
Clear out, boys.
I need to talk to Ramon.

36:19.931 --> 36:21.808
Go!

36:26.063 --> 36:28.899
Yes, cara mia?

36:29.024 --> 36:32.486
Michele and I have this
high school reunion to go to...

36:32.611 --> 36:35.364
and we need to show up
in a really cool car.

36:35.489 --> 36:38.533
- Yeah?
- Todd told me that he gave you a really great deal...

36:38.659 --> 36:44.247
- on an XJS convertible and that you're fixing it up.
- Yeah?

36:44.373 --> 36:47.959
So...

36:48.085 --> 36:50.754
can I borrow your car?

36:50.879 --> 36:53.548
Well, if I loan
you my car...

36:53.674 --> 36:56.426
what do I get?

36:56.551 --> 37:00.430
- Uh, what do you want?
- Ohh, Romy...

37:00.555 --> 37:02.599
you know what I want.

37:02.724 --> 37:06.770
Oh, forget it. I'm not going to have sex
with you just to borrow your stupid car!

37:06.895 --> 37:09.064
I gotta get something.

37:11.817 --> 37:13.944
Okay.

37:14.069 --> 37:19.574
Close the blinds,
and we'll work something out.

37:21.535 --> 37:25.288
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh, Ramon!

37:25.414 --> 37:28.542
- Ohh, Ramon, ohh! Ohh!
- Check this out.

37:28.667 --> 37:31.545
- Oh, yes. Ohh.
- Oh, yeah.

37:31.670 --> 37:33.964
- Oh, man!
- Ohh! Ohh!

37:34.089 --> 37:36.883
Ohh, Ramon!
Ohh, Ramon!

37:37.009 --> 37:39.803
Ohh! Oh, yes.

37:42.097 --> 37:44.141
You are Columbus,
and I am America.

37:44.266 --> 37:47.811
Discover me, Ramon!
Just discover me.

37:47.936 --> 37:51.606
Hey, uh- Explosions.
The earth is moving.

37:51.732 --> 37:56.403
Explosions!
The earth is moving!

37:56.528 --> 38:00.949
Ah, ooh- is that an earthquake?
No, it's Ramon.

38:01.074 --> 38:06.163
Is that an earthquake?
No, it's Ramon!

38:06.288 --> 38:08.540
Ahh! It's Ramon!

38:08.665 --> 38:12.836
Man stallion, fill me
with your giant love wand!

38:12.961 --> 38:15.047
What? No, I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

38:15.172 --> 38:18.550
Well, say something nice
about my penis!

38:18.675 --> 38:22.054
Oh, Ramon, your penis
is so powerful. I'm coming!

38:22.179 --> 38:26.016
- Okay, thanks. Get off me now.
- Aw, come on, wh-

38:26.141 --> 38:28.685
- You wanted it to be believable.
- Aww.

38:28.810 --> 38:32.773
I'm just a girl
in the world

38:32.898 --> 38:37.527
That's all that
you'll let me be

38:37.653 --> 38:42.282
Oh, I'm just a girl
living in captivity

38:45.535 --> 38:47.746
Oh, my God!
You did it!

38:47.871 --> 38:52.668
Yeah, I did.
All right, let's get going.

38:52.793 --> 38:56.296
Oh, this is gonna
be so much fun.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.757
- So, what'd you have to do to get it?
- I had to give all the guys...

38:58.882 --> 39:01.885
in the service department
hand jobs.

39:02.010 --> 39:05.055
Well, while you were doing that,
I taped all the nostalgic songs...

39:05.180 --> 39:08.642
from high school,
to get us in the mood.

39:08.767 --> 39:11.561
- Michele? - Huh?
- I was kidding.

39:11.687 --> 39:15.899
- What?
- You actually think I would do something like that?

39:16.024 --> 39:19.569
For a car?

39:19.695 --> 39:22.447
- Okay, just get in.
- Okay.

39:28.036 --> 39:31.081
Hey, look what else
I got us, little lady.

39:31.206 --> 39:33.917
- Oh, my God. It's a flip phone!
- Uh-huh.

39:34.042 --> 39:36.086
- How'd you get this?
- I bought it.

39:40.841 --> 39:42.968
Okay.

39:49.349 --> 39:51.226
- Are ya ready?
- Ready.

39:51.351 --> 39:53.895
Let's do it.

39:54.021 --> 39:55.897
Tonight
I gotta cut loose

39:56.023 --> 39:57.899
- Footloose -
Footloose! - Footloose!

39:58.025 --> 40:00.485
- Kick off my Sunday shoes
- Kick off my Sunday knees?

40:00.610 --> 40:04.406
- Oowhee, Louise
- I have no idea what the rest of the lyrics are.

40:04.531 --> 40:07.492
- Me neither. Whoo!
- Jack, get back

40:07.617 --> 40:10.662
- Watch out, Tucson, here we come!
- Come on before we crack

40:12.539 --> 40:14.916
- Shit!
- Aww.

40:20.839 --> 40:25.469
- Loose your blues - Watch out, Tucson,
here we come! - Everybody cut footloose

40:25.594 --> 40:29.306
Footloose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes

40:29.431 --> 40:31.391
- Shit!
- Aww.

40:34.102 --> 40:37.314
- Footloose
- Whoo!

40:40.317 --> 40:43.070
- You're playin' so
cool - Whoo! - Whoo!

40:43.195 --> 40:45.656
Obeyin' every rule

40:45.781 --> 40:48.408
- Dig way down in your heart
- Down in your art-

40:48.533 --> 40:50.827
- You're yearnin', burnin'
- You're flurnin', burnin', earnin'

40:50.952 --> 40:53.997
- Somebody to tell you
- Somebody better tell you

40:54.122 --> 40:57.501
- That life ain't passin' you by
- You have one hell of an eye

40:59.127 --> 41:01.880
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

41:02.005 --> 41:04.591
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

41:04.716 --> 41:06.760
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

41:06.885 --> 41:09.346
- Everybody, everybody cut footloose
- Footloose

41:22.985 --> 41:25.487
I got your picture
I got your picture

41:25.612 --> 41:28.073
I'd like a million of ya
all to myself

41:28.198 --> 41:30.742
I want a doctor
to take a picture

41:30.867 --> 41:33.412
So I can look at you
from inside as well

41:33.537 --> 41:37.416
- You got me turning up and turning down
- Okay, I give up. What are you doing?

41:37.541 --> 41:39.876
Pass this car.
This kid is so obnoxious.

41:41.920 --> 41:44.631
- Turning Japanese
- Oh, my God. What is with that kid?

41:44.756 --> 41:47.217
I don't know.
He is sick!

41:47.342 --> 41:52.764
Turning Japanese I think I'm
turning Japanese I really think so

41:52.889 --> 41:57.728
Turning Japanese I think I'm
turning Japanese I really think so

41:57.853 --> 42:00.564
Turning Japanese I think I'm
turning Japanese I really think so

42:00.689 --> 42:03.191
Oh, I'm sorry. No.

42:03.317 --> 42:06.403
No, not you. No. I was trying
to scare your little boy.

42:09.197 --> 42:12.659
Oh, my God.
Are my lips that big?

42:16.413 --> 42:19.291
Woke up this mornin'
happy as can be

42:19.416 --> 42:21.626
- Some more of that?
- Yeah.

42:21.752 --> 42:24.254
All right. Now, just remember,
from this point on...

42:24.379 --> 42:28.175
we are sophisticated, educated,
successful career women.

42:28.300 --> 42:32.095
Right. Okay.

42:32.220 --> 42:36.016
God, this underwear is totally
riding up my butt crack.

42:38.727 --> 42:42.481
Yeah. Hello.
Um, we need something to go.

42:42.606 --> 42:47.527
- Okay.
- Do you have some sort of businesswoman's special?

42:49.154 --> 42:51.323
- Come again?
- Well, we're businesswomen.

42:51.448 --> 42:56.078
- Yeah. From L. A.
- And you know some places have, like, a lunch special.

42:56.203 --> 42:59.039
For businesswomen.

42:59.164 --> 43:02.417
We don't have
anything like that.

43:02.542 --> 43:06.171
Well, then why don't you just give us,
um, two burgers and fries and Diet Cokes...

43:06.296 --> 43:09.716
- 'cause we're in a hurry.
- Mm. We're due in Tucson later.

43:09.841 --> 43:13.804
For a business thing.
You know.

43:13.929 --> 43:15.931
What kind
of business you in?

43:26.274 --> 43:29.277
I can't believe we never thought
of what to say we did for a living.

43:29.403 --> 43:32.072
Oh. Which one
of these guys...

43:32.197 --> 43:34.950
will I have sex with
at the reunion?

43:36.159 --> 43:38.370
Ooh!
Casey Degan!

43:38.495 --> 43:41.581
- Aaah!
- Come on! Now, we're running out of time.

43:44.292 --> 43:48.171
I know. Why don't we say
that we own our own company?

43:48.296 --> 43:50.716
Ooh, good.
Like what?

43:50.841 --> 43:54.594
- Like, what if we invented something?
- Like what?

43:54.720 --> 43:59.057
Well, okay, I-I think it should be like
something that-that everybody has heard about...

43:59.182 --> 44:02.269
but-but nobody really
knows who invented it.

44:02.394 --> 44:04.563
Oh, my God! I've got it!
Post-Its!

44:04.688 --> 44:07.941
- Everybody knows what Post-Its are!
- Yeah!

44:08.066 --> 44:11.278
They're the little yellow things
with the stickum on the back, right?

44:11.403 --> 44:13.405
Okay.

44:13.530 --> 44:16.408
Okay, we're-we're working in this
advertising agency after college.

44:16.533 --> 44:18.618
- Ooh, college! Good one!
- Yeah.

44:18.744 --> 44:21.955
And we have, like, this big,
like, presentation...

44:22.080 --> 44:23.957
to make to,
like, a client.

44:24.082 --> 44:26.877
- Hmm!
- So-so-so we're, like, brainstorming...

44:27.002 --> 44:29.629
and all of the sudden
we're out of paper clips!

44:29.755 --> 44:33.133
- Good!
- And so, okay- So then I, I, like-

44:33.258 --> 44:35.469
Okay, I say-
I say- Okay-

44:35.594 --> 44:38.889
"Wouldn't it be great if there was, like,
this, like, stickum on the back of this paper...

44:39.014 --> 44:43.018
"so, like, it-it would just- if I laid it on
top of that other paper it would just stay...

44:43.143 --> 44:45.020
you know, like,
without a paper clip?"

44:45.145 --> 44:46.772
- Yes!
- Ahh!

44:46.897 --> 44:49.107
So then you've got, like, this
grandfather or this uncle...

44:49.232 --> 44:51.860
that, like, has, like, a- like a-
like a paper company or a paper mill...

44:51.985 --> 44:54.988
and-and he's, like, really into it,
and the rest is history!

44:55.113 --> 44:57.491
Oh, my God!
It is perfect!

44:57.616 --> 45:00.702
Wow!
Don't you think?

45:00.827 --> 45:03.664
Well, yeah, but-

45:03.789 --> 45:06.792
- "Well, yeah, but" what?
- I don't know.

45:06.917 --> 45:10.045
I mean, it just sounds like you invented
Post-Its all by yourself, you know.

45:10.170 --> 45:13.674
- I mean, what did I do?
- Well, it was your grandfather or uncle.

45:15.133 --> 45:16.677
Yeah?

45:16.802 --> 45:19.680
Okay, you know,
so we could say that...

45:19.805 --> 45:21.682
you were,
like, the designer.

45:21.807 --> 45:25.018
Like, I thought of them, but you
thought of making them yellow.

45:27.020 --> 45:29.690
Well, no, but it's like
most of these people...

45:29.815 --> 45:32.192
have, like, known us
since elementary school.

45:32.317 --> 45:35.195
I just think that you're
more believable as a designer...

45:35.320 --> 45:38.991
rather than
as an inventor, you know?

45:39.116 --> 45:41.868
- Uh-huh.
- You're my lover

45:41.994 --> 45:45.330
Not my rival

45:45.455 --> 45:47.332
- What are you doing?
- Look.

45:48.500 --> 45:50.335
You're obviously
pissed at me.

45:50.460 --> 45:52.337
No. Uh-uh. Why should
I be pissed at you?

45:52.462 --> 45:54.548
Just because now I know
how you really feel about me.

45:54.673 --> 45:56.508
Oh, my God,
I knew this would happen.

45:56.633 --> 45:59.845
I mean, I try, for once,
to be honest with you...

45:59.970 --> 46:01.847
and it blows up
in my face.

46:07.269 --> 46:09.980
God!
You wanna be honest?

46:10.105 --> 46:12.983
Okay, good!
Let's be honest!

46:14.359 --> 46:16.236
I let you
have the ideas!

46:16.361 --> 46:18.405
- What?
- Yeah, I let you have the ideas...

46:18.530 --> 46:21.033
so you won't feel so bad
that I'm cuter.

46:21.158 --> 46:24.911
- You are not cuter, Michele.
- I am so cuter.

46:25.037 --> 46:27.539
It's, like, common knowledge, Romy.
Everybody thinks so.

46:27.664 --> 46:30.208
I'm the Mary
and you're the Rhoda.

46:30.334 --> 46:32.794
That's ridiculous. You're the Rhoda.
You're the Jewish one.

46:32.919 --> 46:35.797
Oh, my God. I'm talking
cuteness-wise, Romy, okay?

46:35.922 --> 46:38.091
And cuteness-wise,
I'm the Mary.

46:38.216 --> 46:42.596
That's crazy! You have absolutely
no proof that you're cuter!

46:42.721 --> 46:45.223
Oh, proof? You want proof?
Okay, fine.

46:45.349 --> 46:47.893
- Who lost their virginity first?
- Oh, big wow!

46:48.018 --> 46:51.104
With your cousin Barry.
I wouldn't brag about it.

46:51.229 --> 46:55.776
Okay, so who always gets asked to
dance first when we go to clubs, huh?

46:55.901 --> 46:58.320
No wonder you couldn't
find us boyfriends, Romy.

47:03.283 --> 47:05.869
Well, so what?
You can't even get a job!

47:05.994 --> 47:09.956
- I carry you, Michele! Without me, you'd be lost!
- That is such a lie!

47:10.082 --> 47:12.959
Oh, yeah? Well, let's just see.
Let's split up and see what happens.

47:13.085 --> 47:15.170
W- What do you mean,
split up?

47:15.295 --> 47:19.132
When we get to Tucson,
we're going our own separate ways.

47:19.257 --> 47:21.176
Okay. Good.

47:21.301 --> 47:23.178
Fine.
I don't care.

47:23.303 --> 47:25.013
- Fine!
- Fine.

47:25.138 --> 47:27.307
As of Tucson,
we're finished.

47:28.392 --> 47:30.602
Well, drive fast!

48:22.904 --> 48:26.992
Always something there
to remind me

48:40.255 --> 48:43.133
Wow.
Billy Christianson?

48:45.302 --> 48:47.637
Romy. Romy White.

48:47.763 --> 48:51.224
No. No way.

48:51.350 --> 48:53.602
My God, you-
you look fantastic.

48:53.727 --> 48:57.564
I mean, I- I never would have
recognized you in a million years.

48:57.689 --> 49:00.025
Thanks.

49:00.150 --> 49:03.779
So, what have you been doin'
since high school?

49:03.904 --> 49:07.282
Well,
believe it or not...

49:07.407 --> 49:09.618
I invented Post-Its.

49:20.796 --> 49:22.339
So I told Prescott...

49:22.464 --> 49:25.926
"You can either pay me the 150
or I am out of here. Bye-bye. "

49:26.051 --> 49:30.263
I mean, there are at least 12 other major
markets that would put me on the air tomorrow.

49:30.389 --> 49:33.392
Wow. So you did it?
You're an anchorwoman?

49:33.517 --> 49:37.270
No.
I'm a weather girl.

49:37.396 --> 49:39.815
On the highest-rated
5:00 news in Tucson.

49:39.940 --> 49:41.775
- Oh.
- So...

49:41.900 --> 49:45.612
Michele,
what are you up to?

49:45.737 --> 49:49.282
Uh, okay.
Um, I invented Post-Its.

49:49.408 --> 49:52.119
- You're kidding!
- You must've made a fortune!

49:52.244 --> 49:54.287
Well, yeah.

49:54.413 --> 49:56.289
No offence, Michele...

49:56.415 --> 49:59.501
but how in the world
did you think of Post-Its?

50:01.420 --> 50:04.589
Um... well...

50:04.715 --> 50:06.591
uh...

50:08.719 --> 50:11.346
And I invented them
totally by myself.

50:11.471 --> 50:15.434
I mean, all Michele did was say,
"What about making them yellow?"

50:16.560 --> 50:18.437
Really?

50:25.068 --> 50:29.990
- Actually, I invented a special kind of glue.
- Oh, really?

50:30.115 --> 50:32.826
Well, then I'm sure you wouldn't
mind giving us a detailed account...

50:32.951 --> 50:37.164
of exactly how you concocted
this miracle glue, would you?

50:38.081 --> 50:41.335
No. Um-

50:42.502 --> 50:45.339
Well, ordinarily
when you make glue...

50:45.464 --> 50:48.800
first you need to
thermoset your resin...

50:48.925 --> 50:53.180
and then after it cools
you mix in a, um, epoxide.

50:53.305 --> 50:55.599
Which is really just
a fancy-schmancy name...

50:55.724 --> 50:59.019
for any simple,
oxygenated adhesive, right?

50:59.144 --> 51:03.231
But then I thought maybe- just maybe-
you could raise the viscosity...

51:03.357 --> 51:07.402
by adding a complex glucose derivative
during the emulsification process.

51:07.527 --> 51:10.530
And it turns out,
I was right.

51:12.324 --> 51:14.701
Huh?
I don't believe it.

51:14.826 --> 51:18.330
You must be the most successful
person in our graduating class.

51:18.455 --> 51:21.375
Uh-huh.
And you're not. Bye.

51:21.500 --> 51:24.878
Always something there
to remind me

51:34.513 --> 51:36.390
This is so great.

51:39.184 --> 51:41.061
Romy?

51:43.021 --> 51:44.898
Can I ask you
something?

51:47.818 --> 51:50.696
Romy! You will not believe
what just happened!

51:50.821 --> 51:53.240
Michele, can't you see
that I am busy?

51:54.574 --> 51:56.785
Fine.
Okay, just forget it.

52:02.582 --> 52:05.293
Whoa! Oh. Oww.

52:05.419 --> 52:07.796
Oww. Oww. Oww.

52:07.921 --> 52:09.381
Oh!

52:09.506 --> 52:12.092
Oh! Come on!

52:13.385 --> 52:16.138
Oh, God!
Are you all right?

52:16.263 --> 52:18.890
- What do you think?
- I am so sorry.

52:19.016 --> 52:21.893
My-My-My driver
didn't see you.

52:22.019 --> 52:25.147
Please. Come.

52:25.272 --> 52:28.984
I have boxes of Kleenex
in my limo.

52:29.109 --> 52:30.986
Let me make it up
to you.

52:34.072 --> 52:35.449
Okay.

52:45.542 --> 52:48.337
Oh, my God.

52:48.462 --> 52:51.965
- Here. Help yourself, Michele.
- Thanks.

52:52.090 --> 52:54.301
Wait. How do you
know my name?

52:54.426 --> 52:57.637
It's me, Michele.
Sandy.

52:57.763 --> 53:00.599
- Sandy Frink?
- Uh-huh.

53:00.724 --> 53:03.143
But you're so dreamy.

53:03.268 --> 53:05.145
Well, when I made
my first million...

53:05.270 --> 53:08.357
my present to myself
was a new face.

53:08.482 --> 53:10.359
Okay, I'm not
just saying this...

53:10.484 --> 53:12.694
but you really picked
a good one.

53:12.819 --> 53:14.821
Thanks.

53:16.365 --> 53:18.492
I had this notebook...

53:18.617 --> 53:22.788
with "Mrs Romy Christianson" written
on it, like, about a thousand times.

53:24.915 --> 53:27.793
Now you think
I'm some sort of geek.

53:29.419 --> 53:31.880
No. No.

53:32.005 --> 53:35.133
No, not at all.

53:36.635 --> 53:38.845
I'm flattered.

53:41.807 --> 53:44.184
Hi, Billy.

53:44.309 --> 53:46.812
I've been lookin'
all over for you.

53:47.646 --> 53:49.523
You wanna dance once?

53:49.648 --> 53:52.526
You know,
for old times' sake.

53:59.992 --> 54:02.327
No, thanks.

54:04.329 --> 54:06.873
I owe this one to Romy.

54:33.859 --> 54:36.987
Hey, you guys, they're about
to announce the winners of the vote.

54:37.112 --> 54:40.198
- Come on!
- Vote? What vote?

54:40.324 --> 54:44.161
- Let's go. We gotta get in there.
- Okay.

54:47.956 --> 54:50.417
Wait, I can't
find my top.

54:51.626 --> 54:54.046
Where are you?

55:06.099 --> 55:08.060
Hey, how you guys
doin' tonight?

55:08.185 --> 55:12.439
I bet, uh, everyone
is as anxious...

55:12.564 --> 55:15.067
as I am to hear
the results of the vote.

55:15.192 --> 55:16.985
What vote?

55:17.110 --> 55:21.907
The person voted Most Changed
for the Better Since High School is-

55:23.533 --> 55:27.412
It's a tie.
It's a tie.

55:27.537 --> 55:30.791
The Most Changed for the Better
Since High School are...

55:30.916 --> 55:35.087
Romy White
and Michele Weinberger.

55:40.425 --> 55:44.805
Honey, go on up there
and get your medal.

55:44.930 --> 55:46.807
Okay.

55:46.932 --> 55:50.310
How weird. I didn't
even know we were voting.

56:11.915 --> 56:14.042
Get me another daiquiri.

56:22.801 --> 56:24.678
Here you go.

56:26.304 --> 56:30.475
Um, I'm sorry.
I couldn't find my top.

56:36.273 --> 56:38.191
Honey,
that is beautiful.

58:06.446 --> 58:08.490
May I take that
for you, sir?

58:08.615 --> 58:12.452
No, no, no.
You leave me alone.

58:17.582 --> 58:22.462
Looking at your medal
from the reunion again, dear?

58:24.798 --> 58:27.592
You miss her,
don't you?

58:28.719 --> 58:30.595
Duh.

58:31.430 --> 58:33.306
Michele...

58:35.976 --> 58:41.064
have you been terribly unhappy
with me all these years?

58:41.189 --> 58:43.483
Oh, no.
No, Sandy.

58:43.608 --> 58:45.444
Oh, good.

58:45.569 --> 58:49.156
I've just been lonely
with no one to talk to.

58:51.992 --> 58:54.286
Why don't you call her?

58:55.662 --> 58:57.539
- Okay.
- Yeah.

59:04.171 --> 59:07.341
- Hello?
- Billy Christianson?

59:07.466 --> 59:10.719
Oh, no, no,
I'm-I'm Billy Junior.

59:10.844 --> 59:15.182
Oh, Billy, honey,
is your mommy home?

59:15.307 --> 59:17.100
Well, yeah.

59:17.225 --> 59:20.812
Yeah, but, uh, she can't come
to the phone right now.

59:20.937 --> 59:22.814
She-She's on
her deathbed.

59:22.939 --> 59:25.192
- Romy.
- Oh, dear.

59:25.317 --> 59:27.361
Billy, honey...

59:27.486 --> 59:32.366
tell your mommy that
Michele Weinberger-Frink...

59:32.491 --> 59:34.368
is on the phone...

59:34.493 --> 59:38.622
and would very much
like to speak with her.

59:45.003 --> 59:47.381
No.

59:47.506 --> 59:49.508
Not until you admit...

59:49.633 --> 59:53.053
that I'm the Mary,
and you're the Rhoda.

59:54.054 --> 59:56.723
I'm the Mary.

59:56.848 --> 59:58.725
I'm the Mary!

59:58.850 --> 01:00:04.022
I'm the- You're a pasty hag
on a deathbed.

01:00:05.148 --> 01:00:09.236
I'm the Mary.
Everybody knows.

01:00:09.361 --> 01:00:11.697
Way to go, honey.

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:26.086
Oh, God.

01:00:26.211 --> 01:00:28.088
Oh, we're really here.

01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:32.718
- Oh, God.
- Good evening, sir.

01:00:32.843 --> 01:00:34.928
Thanks for not
waking me up, Romy.

01:00:35.053 --> 01:00:37.431
God, what a bitch.

01:00:57.367 --> 01:01:00.245
Don't get me wrong

01:01:02.372 --> 01:01:04.750
If I'm looking
kind of dazzled

01:01:07.377 --> 01:01:10.756
I see neon lights

01:01:11.882 --> 01:01:14.760
Whenever you walk by

01:01:16.386 --> 01:01:18.764
Don't get me wrong

01:01:20.098 --> 01:01:23.226
- Hey, Romy White.
- Hey.

01:01:23.352 --> 01:01:27.314
- Where's Michele?
- I don't know.

01:01:27.439 --> 01:01:29.775
Um, anybody see
Billy Christianson?

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.653
- Try the bar.
- Thanks, man.

01:01:35.322 --> 01:01:38.950
Don't get me wrong

01:01:39.076 --> 01:01:42.788
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
You-you can't go in without a name tag.

01:01:42.913 --> 01:01:44.831
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

01:01:44.956 --> 01:01:46.917
Uh, Michele Weinberger.

01:01:47.042 --> 01:01:51.630
Oh, my God, Michele Weinberger!
My God, you look great!

01:01:51.755 --> 01:01:55.175
It's me, Toby.
Oh, Toby Walters.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.678
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

01:01:57.803 --> 01:01:59.971
Um, oh, here it is.
Here is your name tag.

01:02:00.097 --> 01:02:02.349
And, um, Romy
is already inside.

01:02:02.474 --> 01:02:06.144
- I could care less. I am not here with Romy.
- You're kidding me.

01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:08.522
No, we're not
even friends any more.

01:02:08.647 --> 01:02:11.692
We had this big falling out
over Post-Its.

01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:14.903
- Post-Its?
- It's a long story.

01:02:15.028 --> 01:02:16.905
- See ya.
- W-W-

01:02:22.327 --> 01:02:25.205
I'm only off to wander

01:02:27.332 --> 01:02:30.210
Across a moonlit night

01:02:33.171 --> 01:02:35.674
Once in a while

01:02:35.799 --> 01:02:37.843
Two people meet

01:02:37.968 --> 01:02:42.014
Seemingly, for no reason
they just pass on the street

01:02:42.139 --> 01:02:47.185
Suddenly thundershowers
everywhere

01:02:47.311 --> 01:02:49.354
Who can explain
the thunder and rain

01:02:49.479 --> 01:02:51.565
But there's somethin'
in the air

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.067
Ooh, excuse me.

01:02:54.192 --> 01:02:56.111
Hi, Romy.
How are you?

01:02:56.236 --> 01:02:59.406
- Lisa Luder?
- Yes.

01:03:00.824 --> 01:03:03.452
So, where's the rest
of the "A" group?

01:03:03.577 --> 01:03:05.954
Oh, they're around here
someplace.

01:03:06.079 --> 01:03:08.206
We sort of lost touch
over the years.

01:03:08.332 --> 01:03:12.377
Wow. Isn't it weird when you're
not friends with your friends any more?

01:03:12.502 --> 01:03:17.299
I mean, Michele and I just fell
out of touch about two hours ago.

01:03:17.424 --> 01:03:19.301
Because she's selfish...

01:03:19.426 --> 01:03:21.720
and she always,
like, devalues me.

01:03:21.845 --> 01:03:23.722
And I'm sick of it,
you know?

01:03:27.893 --> 01:03:30.437
God, you guys are easy
to talk to.

01:03:30.562 --> 01:03:32.439
I invented Post-Its.

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:38.612
- You know, the yellow things with the stickum on the back?
- Yes, I know what they are.

01:03:38.737 --> 01:03:41.490
So, uh,
what are you up to?

01:03:41.615 --> 01:03:45.661
I'm an associate fashion editor
for Vogue.

01:03:45.786 --> 01:03:49.081
Wow! Wh-
Good job!

01:03:49.206 --> 01:03:52.459
Boy, I must have, like,
every single issue of Vogue...

01:03:52.584 --> 01:03:55.712
for the past ten years.

01:03:55.837 --> 01:03:59.007
Okay, well, it was
very nice talking with you.

01:03:59.132 --> 01:04:01.301
Nice talking to you too.

01:04:02.928 --> 01:04:05.806
Okay, Romy.

01:04:05.931 --> 01:04:08.767
It might just be
fantastic

01:04:10.394 --> 01:04:12.813
Don't get me wrong

01:04:22.656 --> 01:04:24.533
It was so cute.

01:04:24.658 --> 01:04:27.035
My mom gave us
a new car seat for the baby.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.163
And when the box arrived, little
Jake looks up at me and says...

01:04:30.288 --> 01:04:32.374
"Mommy,
is that the baby?"

01:04:32.499 --> 01:04:35.627
- Oh.
- I wish.

01:04:36.545 --> 01:04:37.921
Hey, everyone.

01:04:38.046 --> 01:04:40.924
- And so we meet again.
- Oh, hi.

01:04:42.092 --> 01:04:43.301
Romy White.

01:04:44.803 --> 01:04:46.680
You're the chubby girl.

01:04:46.805 --> 01:04:51.310
Oh, well, I was, but I haven't
been for a really long time.

01:04:51.435 --> 01:04:53.979
So, what are
all of you up to?

01:04:54.104 --> 01:04:56.982
Christie, in the yearbook you said
that you wanted Jane Pauley's job.

01:04:57.107 --> 01:05:00.068
Are you a big TV news
anchorwoman now?

01:05:00.193 --> 01:05:03.697
Oh, no, I don't even
watch TV any more.

01:05:03.822 --> 01:05:07.534
My priorities have changed
since I became a mommy.

01:05:07.659 --> 01:05:10.162
Can you believe
this is number three?

01:05:10.287 --> 01:05:12.664
Wow, three kids.

01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:14.916
God, you must feel
really tied down.

01:05:16.668 --> 01:05:20.047
Not at all.
I feel very fulfilled.

01:05:20.172 --> 01:05:24.051
Besides, Billy always
wanted a big family.

01:05:26.678 --> 01:05:29.556
- Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:29.681 --> 01:05:32.726
- You married Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:32.851 --> 01:05:35.479
For almost ten years now.

01:05:35.604 --> 01:05:38.357
Billy's in
real estate development.

01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:43.236
So, how about you?
Any kids?

01:05:44.071 --> 01:05:45.947
Oh, uh, no.

01:05:46.073 --> 01:05:49.910
I just haven't had time, you know, what
with running my own business and all.

01:05:50.035 --> 01:05:51.912
Your own business?

01:05:52.037 --> 01:05:55.624
Yeah.
I invented Post-Its.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.086
No, really.
What do you do?

01:06:00.295 --> 01:06:04.800
That's what I do.
I invented Post-Its.

01:06:04.925 --> 01:06:07.969
Oh. You're kidding me.

01:06:10.722 --> 01:06:12.891
Well, I've made
a lot of money.

01:06:13.016 --> 01:06:16.061
Oh, you know who they say
has made a ton of money? Sandy Frink.

01:06:16.186 --> 01:06:18.063
- The Frink-a-zoid?
- Yeah.

01:06:18.188 --> 01:06:21.900
He invented some special kind of rubber that's
used in every tennis shoe in North America.

01:06:22.025 --> 01:06:24.611
Hey, if anybody
needs to make a call...

01:06:24.736 --> 01:06:27.280
I've got a phone.

01:06:44.756 --> 01:06:46.633
- Is Sandy Frink here?
- Uh, no.

01:06:46.758 --> 01:06:49.636
- Uh, you can't go in without a name tag.
- Fuck off!

01:06:49.761 --> 01:06:54.099
Heather Mooney? Oh, my God,
you're exactly the same.

01:06:54.224 --> 01:06:56.768
Oh, my God.
Heather Mooney is here?

01:06:59.646 --> 01:07:01.982
This ought to be so good.

01:07:05.319 --> 01:07:07.779
Oh, God, don't look now.
It's Heather Mooney.

01:07:07.904 --> 01:07:10.657
- What?
- Hello, Romy.

01:07:10.782 --> 01:07:13.285
Uh- E- Uh- You-

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:16.997
Oh, uh- Heather,
you said you weren't coming.

01:07:17.122 --> 01:07:20.667
Yeah, well, since Sandy
and Michele aren't married-

01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:23.170
What a waste
of a tank of gas, huh?

01:07:24.755 --> 01:07:26.757
Okay, well, come on.
I'll help you go find him.

01:07:26.882 --> 01:07:30.344
Uh, he's not here. I already asked Toby
Dumbfuck. Obviously, I've interrupted.

01:07:30.469 --> 01:07:33.388
Why don't you just go back to ignoring
me like you did in high school?

01:07:33.513 --> 01:07:35.390
No, you can stay.

01:07:35.515 --> 01:07:39.811
We're just discussing our class
success stories. So, what are you up to?

01:07:39.936 --> 01:07:42.898
Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?
I invented the quick-burning paper.

01:07:43.023 --> 01:07:46.318
- Wow, we have a whole class full of inventors.
- Meaning?

01:07:46.443 --> 01:07:48.320
Oh, you know, Sandy Frink
invented something too.

01:07:48.445 --> 01:07:51.323
- Hey, isn't that Sandy over there now?
- What did Sandy invent?

01:07:51.448 --> 01:07:55.994
- Some kind of rubber. - Romy here
invented Post-Its. - You did not.

01:07:56.119 --> 01:07:57.162
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

01:07:57.287 --> 01:07:58.246
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

01:07:58.372 --> 01:07:59.665
Yeah, I-
Well, who did then?

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:02.000
A guy named Art Fry
from the 3M Corp.

01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:04.586
We studied it
in business school.

01:08:07.673 --> 01:08:09.049
You're kidding me.

01:08:09.174 --> 01:08:11.885
You just
made all that up?

01:08:25.357 --> 01:08:28.026
Oh, God,
you are so weird.

01:08:29.653 --> 01:08:31.779
- Why don't you just leave her alone?
- Michele.

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:35.075
Oh, it's
the back brace girl.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.911
- Hi, back brace girl.
- Hi, back brace girl.

01:08:38.036 --> 01:08:40.913
Oh, shut up.

01:08:41.038 --> 01:08:43.082
And what are you
picking on us for anyway?

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:45.585
We are not the ones
who got fat.

01:08:45.711 --> 01:08:48.587
We're pregnant,
you half-wit.

01:08:48.714 --> 01:08:51.591
Oh, yeah, well...

01:08:51.716 --> 01:08:54.886
I hope your babies
look like monkeys.

01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:56.930
Come on, Romy.

01:09:08.358 --> 01:09:13.071
- Oh, Romy.
- Oh, please, go away. Just leave me alone.

01:09:14.238 --> 01:09:17.283
Why did I even
come back here?

01:09:17.408 --> 01:09:20.078
Well, you know what? There are worse
things than telling some dumb story...

01:09:20.203 --> 01:09:22.163
and having everybody
laugh at you.

01:09:22.288 --> 01:09:27.794
- Like what?
- Like losing your best friend.

01:09:27.919 --> 01:09:29.796
You know? I mean,
I had the worst dream, Romy.

01:09:29.921 --> 01:09:34.216
I dreamt that we weren't friends
and we were really, really old.

01:09:34.343 --> 01:09:37.011
But I mean, like, we were, like,
really, really old.

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:39.180
And-And we weren't friends.

01:09:41.224 --> 01:09:44.478
I can't stand that
we're mad at each other.

01:09:44.603 --> 01:09:47.564
Okay, I'm sorry
I said all those things.

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:50.524
You're as cute as me.
You are.

01:09:50.651 --> 01:09:54.446
And-And in some cultures,
maybe cuter.

01:09:54.571 --> 01:09:56.990
I'm sorry too.

01:09:57.115 --> 01:10:01.286
I shouldn't have said that you weren't
smart enough to invent Post-Its.

01:10:01.411 --> 01:10:04.289
Well, I mean,
maybe I'm not.

01:10:04.414 --> 01:10:08.293
Although in my dream,
I did know the formula for glue.

01:10:11.963 --> 01:10:14.299
So, are we friends again?

01:10:16.093 --> 01:10:17.969
Well, duh.

01:10:20.305 --> 01:10:22.224
Okay.

01:10:22.349 --> 01:10:24.226
And you know what,
it doesn't even matter...

01:10:24.351 --> 01:10:27.562
that we told, like, what,
four people some dumb lie.

01:10:27.688 --> 01:10:30.023
Who cares?

01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:32.818
Hi, everybody.

01:10:32.943 --> 01:10:36.196
Settle down. Hi.

01:10:36.321 --> 01:10:39.950
I'm Christie
Masters-Christianson.

01:10:42.619 --> 01:10:45.497
I have been asked
to formally welcome you all...

01:10:45.622 --> 01:10:49.292
to Sagebrush High's
ten-year reunion.

01:10:56.091 --> 01:10:59.469
We have come a long way
in the past ten years.

01:10:59.594 --> 01:11:02.556
Our own Lisa Luder is helping
set the style for the country...

01:11:02.681 --> 01:11:05.309
as a fashion editor
for "Vogue" magazine.

01:11:14.192 --> 01:11:16.820
And Travis McKinney
is in his fifth year...

01:11:16.945 --> 01:11:20.198
as a member of the
Dallas Cowboys football team.

01:11:24.536 --> 01:11:25.412
And...

01:11:25.537 --> 01:11:27.914
Romy and Michele claimed...

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.751
they invented Post-Its.

01:11:51.063 --> 01:11:52.939
All I ever wanted was
for people to think...

01:11:53.065 --> 01:11:54.941
that we were better
than we were in high school.

01:11:55.067 --> 01:11:58.445
And now we're just a stupid joke,
just like we always were.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.908
No, Romy.

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:05.911
Can I tell you the truth?

01:12:07.579 --> 01:12:11.041
I never knew that we weren't
that great in high school.

01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:13.543
I mean, we always had
so much fun together.

01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:15.671
I thought high school
was a blast.

01:12:15.796 --> 01:12:18.965
And until you told me that
our lives weren't good enough...

01:12:19.091 --> 01:12:22.636
I thought everything
since high school was a blast.

01:12:22.761 --> 01:12:25.472
I think we should go back
out there as ourselves...

01:12:25.597 --> 01:12:28.475
and just have fun
like we always do.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.602
The hell with
everyone else.

01:12:30.727 --> 01:12:33.522
I don't think I can.

01:12:33.647 --> 01:12:36.858
Well, do you think you can
stop being such a baby?

01:12:38.151 --> 01:12:40.028
God, I feel like
I've been, like...

01:12:40.153 --> 01:12:42.030
chasing you all over
this reunion.

01:12:42.155 --> 01:12:44.032
We have come
all this way.

01:12:44.157 --> 01:12:48.829
Now we are going to enjoy ourselves
whether you like it or not.

01:12:48.954 --> 01:12:52.916
God, Michele, I've never seen this side
of your personality before.

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:55.002
You're so bossy
and domineering.

01:12:56.628 --> 01:13:00.716
- I like it.
- Me too.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.766
She's got it

01:13:09.891 --> 01:13:12.769
Yeah, baby
she's got it

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.983
- I don't believe it.
- What?

01:13:18.108 --> 01:13:19.484
They're ba-ack.

01:13:22.154 --> 01:13:23.697
Well, I'm your Venus

01:13:23.822 --> 01:13:25.699
- Nice outfits.
- I'm your fire

01:13:25.824 --> 01:13:28.702
Post-Its must be
really lucrative.

01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:38.545
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Oh, yeah, Michele, I am so sure.

01:13:41.131 --> 01:13:43.675
What the hell is
your problem, Christie?

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.178
Why are you always
such a nasty bitch?

01:13:47.888 --> 01:13:50.724
Do you get some kind of sick pleasure
from torturing other people?

01:13:50.849 --> 01:13:54.394
I mean, yeah, okay, so Michele and I
did make up some lame story.

01:13:54.519 --> 01:13:57.230
We only did it because we wanted you
to treat us like human beings.

01:13:57.356 --> 01:13:59.232
But you know what
I finally realized?

01:13:59.358 --> 01:14:02.444
I don't care if you like us
'cause we don't like you.

01:14:02.569 --> 01:14:04.446
You're a bad person
with an ugly heart...

01:14:04.571 --> 01:14:07.449
and we don't give a flying fuck
what you think.

01:14:13.288 --> 01:14:15.916
- Come on, Michele.
- Okay.

01:14:16.041 --> 01:14:18.794
And, yeah.

01:14:18.919 --> 01:14:21.963
It's unbelievable.
They're as deluded about their lives...

01:14:22.089 --> 01:14:24.132
as they are about
those hideous clothes.

01:14:26.051 --> 01:14:29.262
Actually, Christie,
they've got nice lines...

01:14:29.388 --> 01:14:31.598
a fun,
frisky use of colour.

01:14:31.723 --> 01:14:36.061
All in all, I'd have to say
they're really not bad.

01:14:45.862 --> 01:14:49.616
Well, we still think
they're ridiculous.

01:14:49.741 --> 01:14:51.618
Don't we, girls?

01:14:57.749 --> 01:15:00.961
Why don't you just let them
think for themselves for once?

01:15:01.086 --> 01:15:03.588
You're just jealous...

01:15:03.714 --> 01:15:09.011
because unlike a certain ball-busting,
dried-up career woman I might mention...

01:15:09.136 --> 01:15:11.513
we're all happily married.

01:15:11.638 --> 01:15:13.807
That's right, Christie.

01:15:13.932 --> 01:15:16.018
Keep telling
yourself that.

01:15:28.322 --> 01:15:31.158
- I do love those outfits.
- Yeah, sure do.

01:15:31.283 --> 01:15:33.201
- Oh, great.
- Thanks.

01:15:33.327 --> 01:15:35.329
Michele made them.

01:15:35.454 --> 01:15:39.333
Well, I just sewed them.
We both designed them.

01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:42.127
- Fifty-fifty.
- Wow. - Yeah.

01:15:42.252 --> 01:15:43.962
That's so cool.

01:15:45.589 --> 01:15:47.549
Well, it's been really
terrific seeing all of you.

01:15:47.674 --> 01:15:49.843
- Come on, Michele.
- Oh, okay, bye.

01:15:50.927 --> 01:15:51.803
Hi.

01:15:53.513 --> 01:15:57.851
I am sorry that I blew
your big lie for you.

01:15:57.976 --> 01:16:01.688
Hey, that's okay.
It was better this way anyway.

01:16:01.813 --> 01:16:06.026
It's ironic, isn't it? I really thought
you guys had it made in high school.

01:16:06.151 --> 01:16:07.819
- Us?
- Yes, you.

01:16:07.944 --> 01:16:10.739
With your long hair
and your long legs...

01:16:10.864 --> 01:16:12.991
walkin' on your legs,
flippin' your hair.

01:16:13.116 --> 01:16:15.035
I can't compete with that.
You made Sandy crazy.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.746
And the whole time
you were makin' my life hell...

01:16:17.871 --> 01:16:20.374
the "A" group was making
your life hell; I didn't know.

01:16:20.499 --> 01:16:25.045
You know what? I bet in high school
everybody made somebody's life hell.

01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:29.424
Mm-mmm, not me. Never had the
opportunity to make anyone's life hell.

01:16:29.549 --> 01:16:33.053
You know what? I bet that's not true.
You were really unpleasant.

01:16:33.178 --> 01:16:35.055
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. God.

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.391
Heather?
Oh, I'm off duty.

01:16:37.516 --> 01:16:40.185
Um, since you never
got around to it in high school...

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:42.896
I was wondering
if you could sign my yearbook.

01:16:43.021 --> 01:16:46.149
And, uh, please don't
tell me to fuck off...

01:16:46.274 --> 01:16:48.235
because it really hurts
my feelings.

01:16:49.611 --> 01:16:52.781
- I hurt your feelings?
- Yeah, all the time.

01:16:52.906 --> 01:16:55.784
Tremendous!
That's tremendous!

01:16:55.909 --> 01:16:58.453
Go get your stupid yearbook.
I would be happy to sign it.

01:16:58.578 --> 01:17:02.374
Okay, great.
I'll-I'll be right back, okay?

01:17:02.499 --> 01:17:05.335
Michele, I think maybe
we should leave.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.963
There is no way this reunion
is gonna get any better.

01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:13.135
Hey, everybody, Sandy Frink
just landed in a helicopter!

01:17:14.261 --> 01:17:16.305
Sandy Frink
has a helicopter?

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:18.265
Yeah. Apparently he's worth,
like, millions.

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:21.935
He invented some kind of
special rubber or something.

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:24.646
Like for condoms?

01:17:29.484 --> 01:17:32.362
Whoa-ohh-ohh

01:17:36.241 --> 01:17:39.619
The hot summer night

01:17:39.745 --> 01:17:42.122
Fell like a net

01:17:43.749 --> 01:17:48.128
I've gotta find
my baby yet

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.966
You think I'm cute

01:17:53.091 --> 01:17:56.345
A little bit shy

01:17:56.470 --> 01:18:01.224
Mama, I ain't
that kind of guy

01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:05.854
That's Sandy Frink?
What the hell was I thinking?

01:18:05.979 --> 01:18:07.439
Whoa-ohh-ohh

01:18:12.277 --> 01:18:14.154
Sandy, hi.

01:18:14.279 --> 01:18:16.365
- Doctor, Doctor, give me the news
- You look so rich.

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:20.661
- I got a bad case of lovin' you
- I mean, great.

01:18:20.786 --> 01:18:22.996
No pill's gonna
cure my ill

01:18:23.121 --> 01:18:28.794
I got a bad case
of lovin' you

01:18:30.295 --> 01:18:32.631
Michele.

01:18:32.756 --> 01:18:37.886
- After all these years, you still take my breath away.
- Thanks.

01:18:38.011 --> 01:18:41.473
So you must be, like,
the most successful person...

01:18:41.598 --> 01:18:43.517
in our entire
graduating class.

01:18:44.977 --> 01:18:48.188
Well, I guess that depends
on how you define "success. "

01:18:48.313 --> 01:18:52.025
If, to you, success means
having a house in Aspen...

01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:55.988
one in Acapulco, a penthouse in
New York, a mansion in Malibu...

01:18:56.113 --> 01:18:58.740
a 60-foot yacht,
an eight-seat Windstar...

01:18:58.865 --> 01:19:01.868
a Bell Jet Ranger, a Bentley,
a personal trainer, a full-time chef...

01:19:01.994 --> 01:19:03.870
a live-in masseuse
and a staff of 24...

01:19:03.996 --> 01:19:06.206
then, yeah...

01:19:06.331 --> 01:19:08.417
I guess I am successful.

01:19:10.168 --> 01:19:13.505
But no matter
how much I accumulate...

01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:16.883
there's still one thing
I just don't have.

01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:19.720
Your own country?

01:19:21.972 --> 01:19:24.016
I don't have you,
Michele.

01:19:27.811 --> 01:19:29.771
Will you dance with me?

01:19:31.898 --> 01:19:35.527
Only if Romy
can dance with us.

01:19:35.652 --> 01:19:37.529
Sure.

01:19:56.089 --> 01:19:58.300
Lying in my bed

01:19:58.425 --> 01:20:03.305
I hear the clock tick
and think of you

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:06.308
Caught up in circles

01:20:06.433 --> 01:20:10.437
Confusion is nothing new

01:20:10.562 --> 01:20:14.650
Flashback
Warm nights

01:20:14.775 --> 01:20:17.903
Almost left behind

01:20:18.028 --> 01:20:21.990
Suitcase of memories

01:20:22.115 --> 01:20:26.662
Time after
Sometimes you picture me

01:20:26.787 --> 01:20:30.624
I'm walkin'
too far ahead

01:20:30.749 --> 01:20:33.794
You're callin' to me

01:20:33.919 --> 01:20:38.131
I can't hear
what you've said

01:20:38.256 --> 01:20:42.469
Then you say "Go slow"

01:20:42.594 --> 01:20:45.806
I fall behind

01:20:45.931 --> 01:20:48.517
The second hand unwinds

01:20:48.642 --> 01:20:53.188
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

01:20:53.313 --> 01:20:56.024
Time after time

01:20:56.149 --> 01:21:00.487
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

01:21:00.612 --> 01:21:03.323
Time after time

01:21:03.448 --> 01:21:07.953
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

01:21:08.078 --> 01:21:10.497
Time after time

01:21:10.622 --> 01:21:12.499
If you fall
I will catch you

01:21:12.624 --> 01:21:15.293
- I'll be waiting
- I will be waiting

01:21:15.419 --> 01:21:17.004
Time after time

01:21:19.131 --> 01:21:21.008
Time after time

01:21:22.801 --> 01:21:24.845
Time after time

01:21:26.471 --> 01:21:29.516
Time after time

01:21:29.641 --> 01:21:32.019
Time after time

01:21:33.645 --> 01:21:35.731
See, I told you
it would pay off...

01:21:35.856 --> 01:21:38.233
to go to those clubs
every night.

01:21:43.322 --> 01:21:44.531
Come on.

01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:51.163
Oh, Jesus,
Mary and Joseph.

01:21:51.288 --> 01:21:53.206
What do you want?

01:21:53.332 --> 01:21:56.877
You were right. I was
a brain-dead, redneck asshole.

01:21:57.002 --> 01:21:59.046
Although I never screwed
a sheep or my sister.

01:21:59.171 --> 01:22:01.340
Why not?
Couldn't catch 'em?

01:22:01.465 --> 01:22:05.552
I guess I deserve that.
I was a jerk.

01:22:07.346 --> 01:22:09.222
But I was so miserable
in high school...

01:22:09.348 --> 01:22:12.351
I don't think I spoke more than
two words the entire time.

01:22:12.476 --> 01:22:16.563
I just couldn't
breathe there, you know?

01:22:16.688 --> 01:22:19.066
Plus, I had this
really bad stutter.

01:22:20.609 --> 01:22:24.196
Listen, you, uh,
wanna go somewhere quiet?

01:22:24.321 --> 01:22:26.406
Somewhere
where we can talk?

01:22:26.531 --> 01:22:29.951
- You-You wanna talk to me?
- Yeah.

01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:33.497
Okay, cowboy, I don't know
what your trip is...

01:22:33.622 --> 01:22:36.583
- but if this is some kind
of a sick game- - What? No.

01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:39.419
If you fuck with me
in any way, I will rip...

01:22:39.544 --> 01:22:42.798
each and every appendage from your body,
starting with your dick, capisce?

01:22:44.216 --> 01:22:47.928
Look, I j-just
w- wanted to talk.

01:22:50.889 --> 01:22:52.933
Okay.

01:22:53.058 --> 01:22:54.977
What the hell.

01:22:56.144 --> 01:22:57.521
What is your name?

01:22:57.646 --> 01:22:59.523
- Clarence.
- I like your hat, Clarence.

01:22:59.648 --> 01:23:01.566
- Thank you.
- Pick up the pace.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.705
You wait here.
I'll prep my chopper.

01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:16.707
- Okay.
- All right.

01:23:18.542 --> 01:23:21.378
Oh, my God, somebody's
puking in the bushes.

01:23:21.503 --> 01:23:23.380
Eeewww!

01:23:26.425 --> 01:23:28.635
Hey, how you guys doin'?

01:23:29.553 --> 01:23:30.929
Billy?

01:23:32.097 --> 01:23:35.642
- Chubbo?
- The name is Romy.

01:23:37.352 --> 01:23:39.354
Romy and Michele.

01:23:41.106 --> 01:23:45.610
So, weren't you guys, like,
totally in love with me in high school?

01:23:45.736 --> 01:23:47.863
She was.

01:23:54.786 --> 01:23:56.997
You wanna get a room?

01:23:57.122 --> 01:23:59.458
But you're married.

01:23:59.583 --> 01:24:03.003
- To Christie.
- Yeah, but you've got children...

01:24:03.128 --> 01:24:06.298
and you're a successful
real estate developer.

01:24:07.924 --> 01:24:11.511
I do drywall for her old man's
construction company.

01:24:11.637 --> 01:24:15.349
And-And you know this new kid?
Don't even know if he's mine.

01:24:17.184 --> 01:24:19.061
So-

01:24:19.186 --> 01:24:21.480
How about that room?

01:24:26.193 --> 01:24:28.070
Okay.

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:32.658
Why don't you go
and get that room?

01:24:32.783 --> 01:24:36.370
Go and wash your face
and take off all your clothes...

01:24:36.495 --> 01:24:38.538
and I'll be up there
in five minutes.

01:24:38.664 --> 01:24:40.374
All right!

01:24:41.625 --> 01:24:45.379
Your fantasy
is gonna come true...

01:24:45.504 --> 01:24:47.547
tonight.

01:24:49.007 --> 01:24:51.218
- See you later.
- Ugh- Okay.

01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:02.729
- God.
- Now he's gonna see what it feels like to wait.

01:25:02.854 --> 01:25:05.691
- That's such a good one.
- Ladies.

01:25:07.818 --> 01:25:13.198
- God, can you believe we're going home in a helicopter?
- I know. It's so cool.

01:25:13.323 --> 01:25:16.868
I just wish everybody inside the reunion
would come out and see us lift off.

01:25:16.994 --> 01:25:18.537
Ohh!

01:25:18.662 --> 01:25:20.539
Thank you.

01:25:23.959 --> 01:25:25.544
Oh.

01:25:30.841 --> 01:25:35.595
Oh, my God! I'm so glad you didn't
bring your big notebook with you.

01:25:35.721 --> 01:25:37.389
Michele.

01:25:37.514 --> 01:25:41.226
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth

01:25:41.351 --> 01:25:45.272
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

01:25:45.397 --> 01:25:48.942
They say in heaven
love comes first

01:25:49.067 --> 01:25:52.446
We'll make heaven
a place on earth

01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:56.116
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

01:25:56.241 --> 01:25:59.661
Billy. Billy!

01:25:59.786 --> 01:26:02.289
Billy, where are you?

01:26:03.415 --> 01:26:06.918
Billy. Damn it.
Damn it!

01:26:13.592 --> 01:26:15.761
Oh, my God.
Is that Heather?

01:26:15.886 --> 01:26:18.680
Go for it, Heather!

01:26:18.805 --> 01:26:22.142
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth

01:26:23.518 --> 01:26:25.937
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

01:26:26.063 --> 01:26:29.691
They say in heaven
love comes first

01:26:29.816 --> 01:26:31.693
Thanks for stopping by.

01:26:31.818 --> 01:26:33.820
Yeah. Enjoy your fashions.

01:26:33.945 --> 01:26:35.822
Have a Romy and Michele day.

01:26:35.947 --> 01:26:38.492
- That was a good one.
- Thanks.

01:26:38.617 --> 01:26:40.952
I cannot believe
how busy we've been.

01:26:41.078 --> 01:26:44.956
I know. Hey, maybe we can
pay back Sandy this week.

01:26:45.082 --> 01:26:48.043
Um, I think we're about, like,
two years away from that.

01:26:48.168 --> 01:26:51.004
Oh. Okay.

01:26:57.469 --> 01:27:01.014
Heather, um, has anyone ever told you
that smoking can kill you?

01:27:01.139 --> 01:27:04.309
No. No one. Thank you.

01:27:04.434 --> 01:27:07.020
Okay, but if you burn it,
you bought it.

01:27:07.145 --> 01:27:09.648
Like I give a shit.
I look like an asshole.

01:27:09.773 --> 01:27:12.025
What? Nuh-uh.
You look totally cute.

01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:16.697
This dress exacerbates the genetic
betrayal that is my legacy.

01:27:16.822 --> 01:27:19.157
Okay, I don't even know what you're
talking about because of those words...

01:27:19.282 --> 01:27:21.159
but come here.

01:27:21.284 --> 01:27:24.371
- Ow!
- God, that has been bugging me.

01:27:24.496 --> 01:27:28.250
- Stay away from my bikini area.
- Um, okay.

01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:31.545
- I'm in a rush. Ring it up if you must.
- Okay.

01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:33.714
Let me have the tag, please.

01:27:33.839 --> 01:27:35.716
Thank you.

01:27:35.841 --> 01:27:37.718
You really do look cute.

01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:44.308
- You know what?
- Huh?

01:27:44.433 --> 01:27:48.687
Despite that surly demeanour, I think
we've just given her a big gift.

01:27:48.812 --> 01:27:51.023
Okay, I mean,
to give someone...

01:27:51.148 --> 01:27:54.735
like Heather Mooney the chance
to express herself through fashion-

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.279
We could've really
changed her life.

01:27:57.404 --> 01:28:00.490
Yeah. For me though,
it's like...

01:28:00.615 --> 01:28:03.493
I've given birth to
my own baby girl, you know?

01:28:03.618 --> 01:28:05.662
Only she's, like,
a big giant girl...

01:28:05.787 --> 01:28:08.665
who smokes
and says "shit" a lot.

01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:11.752
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:28:11.877 --> 01:28:15.547
- Yeah. Let's fold scarves!
- Okay.

01:28:18.091 --> 01:28:19.968
- You know what, Michele?
- Huh?

01:28:20.093 --> 01:28:22.596
I think you are, like,
the funnest person I know.

01:28:22.721 --> 01:28:24.931
Me too.
With you.

01:28:33.774 --> 01:28:36.777
See the people
walkin' down the street

01:28:36.902 --> 01:28:39.946
Fall in line

01:28:40.072 --> 01:28:42.616

where everyone can go

01:28:42.741 --> 01:28:45.160
But they're walkin'

01:28:45.285 --> 01:28:47.954

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:05.305
They can't wait
to hang out and be cool

01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:07.641
Hang around
till quarter after twelve

01:29:07.766 --> 01:29:10.477

Go Go music
really makes us dance

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:43.135
In the crowd
it puts us in a trance

01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:45.470

So just give us a chance
