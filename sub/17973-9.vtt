Donna, you got to see what I did
for the Super Bowl party!

00:36.337 --> 00:39.004
Put some deodorant on
and come in here!

00:39.006 --> 00:40.639
(deodorant spritzes)

00:40.641 --> 00:42.508
Both arms.
(spritzes)

00:42.510 --> 00:44.943
Cleveland, what
on earth is that?

00:44.945 --> 00:48.147
V.I.P. skybox. I'm not
sitting down here with you.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.282
(loud rumbling)
Oh, my God!

00:50.284 --> 00:52.084
Is that the Rapture?

00:52.086 --> 00:54.520
No. Rehearsal
of the Blue Angel flyover.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.455
They protect nothing.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.023
You know, Cleveland,
if you didn't spend

00:58.025 --> 00:59.958
all our money on your
Super Bowl parties,

00:59.960 --> 01:01.960
maybe you could
buy    a McMansion.

01:01.962 --> 01:05.130
Like that new one
across the street. Mmm!

01:05.132 --> 01:06.165
<i>Pillars.</i>

01:06.167 --> 01:07.199
CLEVELAND:
<i>Vulgar.</i>

01:07.201 --> 01:08.867
It's vulgar, Donna.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.502
Do you want to be vulgar?

01:10.504 --> 01:13.105
Look! Someone's trying
to break into it!

01:14.974 --> 01:16.141
Donna, call the police.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.976
No, man, you
should do it.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.478
You sound white
on the phone.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.113
They actually
might come.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.616
You sounded white
on the phone.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.651
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.352
That window.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.656
Hey, can I hold the gun?
Sure.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.791
(imitating quiet gunshots)

01:32.793 --> 01:34.259
How do I look?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.128
Badass.
(loud thud)

01:36.130 --> 01:37.563
Freeze, dirtbag!

01:39.799 --> 01:40.933
Choni?

01:40.935 --> 01:43.035
Why are you trying
to rob this house?

01:43.037 --> 01:45.037
(Latin accent):
Cleveland, this is my house.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.539
We just moved in,
and I forgot my keys.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.041
<i>Your</i> house?
B-But there are

01:49.043 --> 01:52.544
more rooms than
there are people.
Here we go!

01:52.546 --> 01:54.146
Uh, you two
know each other?

01:54.148 --> 01:56.748
Yeah. the last time
I saw <i>this</i> chump,

01:56.750 --> 01:59.251
he tried to have
my niece deported.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.285
That's a lie!

02:00.287 --> 02:02.454
My son is married
to her niece.

02:02.456 --> 02:06.325
Daddy! They put the
my frozen yogurt! on

02:06.327 --> 02:08.660
How old is your son?
14.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.363
It was a whole green-card,
wedding-fraud thing.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.099
Well, then you're
under arrest for...
I don't think so.

02:14.101 --> 02:15.968
They're not even doing it.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.137
Are you?
No, Daddy.
We're just friends.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.105
Please don't
shoot the yogurt!

02:20.107 --> 02:21.173
Give me a gummy.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.979
Say good-b...
DONNA: Cleveland, give
the officer his gun back!

02:26.981 --> 02:28.147
All right.

02:28.149 --> 02:31.183
Cleveland, I see
what's going on here.

02:31.185 --> 02:34.186
I've dealt with your
type my whole life.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.256
Back in Fort Lauderdale,
when I came out of the ocean,

02:37.258 --> 02:39.491
they accused <i>me</i> of
sneaking into the country.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.494
But I was just
boogieboarding
on an old door.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.129
Probably wearing jeans.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.964
And now you
called the police

02:45.966 --> 02:48.300
because you saw a Latina
going into a window

02:48.302 --> 02:52.471
and you automatically
assumed I was a criminal!

02:52.473 --> 02:54.106
Look, Choni, it was dark.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.842
I thought you
were a male Latiño.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.677
Why are you doing that
with your "N"?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.878
I don't kñow.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.146
You think that's funny?

03:01.148 --> 03:03.182
You think we talk funny?
Well, I'm not laughing,

03:03.184 --> 03:05.117
because I laugh when
I want to laugh,

03:05.119 --> 03:07.686
and no one tells
me when to laugh.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

03:07.688 --> 03:09.588
See? That was
my decision.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.589
Okay.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.025
I'll tell you what
your problem is.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.093
(ranting in Spanish)

03:19.365 --> 03:21.433
(continues ranting in Spanish)

03:23.136 --> 03:25.504
<i>...muy, muy,</i> muy <i>pequeño.</i>

03:25.506 --> 03:28.040
(laughter)

03:28.042 --> 03:29.841
<i>Es la verdad.</i>

03:29.843 --> 03:31.777
<i>Es la verdad.</i>

03:32.812 --> 03:34.680
(Fox NFL theme playing)
MAN:
<i>And now,</i>

03:34.682 --> 03:36.515
in honor of
Super Bowl XLVI,

03:36.517 --> 03:39.017
we've got a special
message from our troops

03:39.019 --> 03:41.620
who are watching
from Afghanistan.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.522
Get us out of here!
We lost!

03:43.524 --> 03:45.023
This was my 20s!

03:45.025 --> 03:46.024
(chuckles)

03:46.026 --> 03:48.126
Looks like we got
the comedy troop.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.328
Very funny, boys.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.996
See you next year.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.632
Where is everybody?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.601
MAN:
At Choni's. Better party.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.803
Oh. Then why are you here?

03:57.805 --> 04:00.105
There's a line at
the bathroom there.

04:12.952 --> 04:15.020
(loud crunching)

04:27.200 --> 04:29.268
(toilet flushes)

04:33.806 --> 04:35.207
Clogged it.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.242
(lively dance music playing)

04:39.212 --> 04:40.646
Name.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.614
Cleveland Brown.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.950
Hmm. I got a Cleveland
Brown <i>Junior.</i>

04:44.952 --> 04:46.852
Hi, Daddy! We're
watching the game

04:46.854 --> 04:49.454
in high-definition 3-D.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.089
(crowd cheering on TV)

04:51.091 --> 04:52.624
(grunts)

04:52.626 --> 04:54.192
Sorry about your
table, Ms. Choni.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.927
Great party, by the way.

04:55.929 --> 04:59.197
Thanks, Ben
Roethlisberger.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.700
(woman screams)

05:01.702 --> 05:04.736
Mm. Quarterbacks
get <i>all</i> the ladies.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.272
Donna!

05:07.274 --> 05:09.541
Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.144
But Choni stole
my Super Bowl party!

05:12.146 --> 05:14.146
Aw... a Puerto
Rican-Mexican

05:14.148 --> 05:16.948
stole your little
Super Bowl party?

05:16.950 --> 05:19.685
(chuckles) Why don't
you call the police?

05:19.687 --> 05:21.119
(laughter)

05:21.121 --> 05:22.754
I  <i>did</i>steal your party

05:22.756 --> 05:24.923
to teach you a lesson
for humiliating me.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.759
Do not mess with
this Latina, uh-huh.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.828
I got a bigger
house than you.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.630
I got a bigger
party than you.

05:31.632 --> 05:34.466
And now I got <i>all</i>
<i>of your friends.</i>

05:34.468 --> 05:37.035
(gasps) You'll never
take my friends!

05:37.037 --> 05:40.572
CHONI:
Anybody want to leave <i>this</i> party
and go with Cleveland?

05:43.976 --> 05:45.777
No. No one does.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.279
Viva Choni!

05:47.281 --> 05:49.481
OTHERS:
Viva Choni!

05:49.483 --> 05:51.583
How does it feel
to make losers

05:51.585 --> 05:54.086
feel worse
about themselves?

05:54.088 --> 05:56.021
Whatever puts braces
on my kids' teeth.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.357
You're a good dad.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.164
I don't know why people

06:06.166 --> 06:08.100
like Choni's party
better than mine.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.769
All she had was
a much bigger TV,
better food,

06:10.771 --> 06:14.139
probably had that
sweet rice milk drink--

06:14.141 --> 06:16.708
what's that called
again, Donna?
Horchata.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.211
You know what I do
when I don't know
something, Donna?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.946
I say "I don't know."

06:20.948 --> 06:22.147
But that's what
it's called!

06:22.149 --> 06:23.782
Anyway, back to me.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.485
I used to consider myself
the mayor of Grace Street.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.153
(sighs)

06:28.155 --> 06:30.655
Guess I won't need this anymore.

06:30.657 --> 06:34.359
Or be cutting any
ceremonial ribbons with this.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.628
And I have no use for this.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.297
It's an actual prop from
<i>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,</i>

06:39.299 --> 06:41.133
my favorite movie of all time.

06:41.135 --> 06:42.534
(sighs)

06:42.536 --> 06:45.170
But I don't need it now.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.639
Cleveland, you and
Choni just got off
on the wrong foot.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.008
Why don't you go over
and make a peace offering?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.843
I just baked some
lemon squares.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.678
Perfect!

06:53.680 --> 06:54.880
I'm running with these!

06:54.882 --> 06:55.881
I'm running with these!

06:55.883 --> 06:58.016
(clattering)
(screams)

06:58.018 --> 07:00.352
Little help?

07:00.354 --> 07:02.354
(doorbell rings)

07:02.356 --> 07:05.257
(mouth full):
Choni, I brought you
a lemon-scented pan.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.260
(normal voice):
Which is a traditional
American way of saying sorry.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.862
And to show you that there
are no hard feelings,

07:10.864 --> 07:13.532
I won't make a big deal
out of the fact that

07:13.534 --> 07:15.367
your Chihuahua bit me.

07:15.369 --> 07:18.136
Okay, first, we
don't have a Chihuahua.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.938
We have two Weimaraners.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.040
And second, that's
not a Chihuahua,

07:22.042 --> 07:24.209
that's a rat.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.011
Aah! Rabies!

07:26.013 --> 07:27.879
Tetanus! Rat AIDS!

07:27.881 --> 07:29.448
Aah! Oh!
Bleeding pretty bad.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.017
You don't have a bandage
or tortilla, do you?

07:32.019 --> 07:34.119
I'll take corn,
but I prefer flour.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.987
You know what
you are, Cleveland?

07:35.989 --> 07:37.322
You're rrrracist.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.957
You tried to get
my niece deported,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.525
you called the cops on me,

07:40.527 --> 07:43.195
you assume I own a Chihuahua
and have tortillas for bandages.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.796
You're racist.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.799
(laughs)
Oh, Choni, black people
can'tbe racist.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.670
Listen to you, talking nonsense
like some oily Polynesian.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.605
You think you could
get away with it

07:53.607 --> 07:54.973
because you think
you're so likable.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.309
Well, I'm not falling for
your happy moustache face.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.945
♪ I say to
Cleveland, go! ♪

07:59.947 --> 08:01.146
(laughing)

08:01.148 --> 08:02.347
(groans):
Oh...

08:04.851 --> 08:06.585
Principal Farquhar,

08:06.587 --> 08:08.487
I'd like you to
meet a new student,

08:08.489 --> 08:10.088
my wife Cecilia.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.023
Pregnancy or green card?

08:12.025 --> 08:14.159
Green card. We're
just friends.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.428
Papers.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.931
Hmm. Checks out.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.267
Congratulations on your
sexless marriage, Junior.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.603
And you on your
sexless life, sir.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.671
Thank you. Carry on.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.140
Is he the coolest?

08:29.142 --> 08:32.210
So, friend, Valentine's
Day is coming up.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.013
Is there a girl around here
that you're interested in?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.816
Oh, me? Well, I kind of
like to play the field.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.417
You know, keep
my options open.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.086
'Sup, Marissa?
Die, fatty.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.321
(giggles)
She's fun.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.290
What about you?

08:45.292 --> 08:48.994
Well, there is someone
from my science class.

08:50.162 --> 08:51.796
I know Tyler. Nice guy.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.131
Good water-fountain
etiquette.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.633
Doesn't put his
mouth on it

08:54.635 --> 08:57.035
like some of these
spout-suckers.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.436
Why don't you ask <i>him</i> out?

08:58.438 --> 09:01.940
I don't think I can just
walk up to him and ask him out.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.842
Where I'm from,
women just wait around

09:03.844 --> 09:06.044
until a man kicks down
our straw door

09:06.046 --> 09:08.013
and trades our virginity
for a donkey.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.014
Really?!

09:09.016 --> 09:10.749
No, I'm just shy.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.450
Well, then I'll
talk you up to him.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.119
What kind of
husband would I be

09:14.121 --> 09:16.588
if I didn't find
a man for you on
Valentine's Day?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.490
(gasps)
You would do
that for me?

09:18.492 --> 09:19.925
Oh, Junior,
that would be so...

09:19.927 --> 09:22.160
Sorry, one second.
Yo, Chief!

09:22.162 --> 09:25.096
No lollipopping
the mouthpiece!

09:25.098 --> 09:27.432
(Junior yelling)

09:30.002 --> 09:32.137
And on top of stealing
my Super Bowl party,

09:32.139 --> 09:33.638
she had the ca-chonis

09:33.640 --> 09:36.174
to call me racist
toward Latinos.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.642
If you're a racist,

09:37.644 --> 09:39.878
then you're the
best-looking
racist in town.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.814
I haven't had time
to get to the gym!

09:42.816 --> 09:45.016
I can't be racist--
I voted for Pedro!

09:45.018 --> 09:46.585
Fresh.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.486
Well, you <i>did</i> petition
the City Council

09:48.488 --> 09:51.356
to build a ten-foot wall
around the Taco Bell.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.025
They were stealing
jobs from the Arby's!

09:54.027 --> 09:55.994
And you walked out of <i>La Bamba.</i>

09:55.996 --> 09:57.996
I thought I was
seeing <i>L.A. Bambi,</i>

09:57.998 --> 09:59.531
where Bambi
moves to Hollywood

09:59.533 --> 10:01.433
and becomes a
movie star's butler.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.635
Not to pile it
on, Cleveland,

10:03.637 --> 10:06.104
but you never listened to
that Enrique Iglesias CD

10:06.106 --> 10:08.006
I burned for you.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.307
Yes, but in my defense,

10:09.309 --> 10:12.611
all Latino music
is loud and horrible.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.512
It's not so much
that you're racist,

10:14.514 --> 10:17.082
you're what I like to call
"Arizona ignorant."

10:17.084 --> 10:19.985
Hey, at least it's
a  <i>dry</i>ignorance.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.186
(laughs)

10:21.188 --> 10:22.954
Uh, maybe
I am ignorant.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.956
I need to go
talk to Choni.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.124
Uh-uh!

10:26.126 --> 10:28.893
Fool me once.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.664
Choni, you're right.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.966
I have been insensitive
to your culture,

10:34.968 --> 10:37.102
but that's because
I don't know any better.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.670
"Ju" don't know
anything.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.271
Don't you call me a Jew!

10:40.273 --> 10:41.773
Oh, se,
ri.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.943
My point is, I want to learn
more about your people,

10:44.945 --> 10:47.646
like your cultural values,
and why, sometimes,

10:47.648 --> 10:50.515
you throw English words in there
while you're speaking Spanish,

10:50.517 --> 10:53.451
like you're all, "Wocka wocka
chocka chocka Facebook,

10:53.453 --> 10:56.588

Better go say helo
to my date.

You kinky son

No, no. I'm just glad

Look at them.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.151
Nice.

Isn't.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.153
That.

Nice.

She's great.

I know, she is great.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.866
That's why I
married her.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.534
Hey, Junior,
that kind of hurts.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.636
Yeah, turns out you know
what else hurts?

13:58.638 --> 14:02.106
Watching your wife kiss some
huckleberry in a jean jacket.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.107
Whoa!

14:03.109 --> 14:04.375
Junior, I don't
understand.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.044
You're the one that told me
to take her out.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.013
And now I'm telling you that
you might not want to show up.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.983
You know, Tyler, yearbook
photos are coming up.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.986
Shame if something happened
to this pretty face of yours.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.988
Real shame.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.157
Ooh, the Bookmobils
coming!

14:19.159 --> 14:21.492
I'm gonna get me a sticker
with an apple on it

14:21.494 --> 14:24.262

15:05.272 --> 15:08.840
I thought we were reading
<i>Don Quixote, but it's a start.</i>

15:08.842 --> 15:11.009
I don't want to read a book
about a donkey.

15:11.011 --> 15:14.012
I'll pin a tail on one, but
I'm not gonna get into reading.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.246
Cleveland,
this is my son, Marco.

15:16.181 --> 15:17.815
My babysitter just canceled,

15:17.817 --> 15:20.685
and Donna said you might be able
to keep an eye on him.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.920
Wait a minute.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.956
A Mexican is asking me
to watch their kid?

15:24.958 --> 15:28.126
Is what the old me
would've said.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.994
It'll be an honor
to watch him.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.195
You sure it's no problem?

15:31.197 --> 15:33.631
Take all the time
you want.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.034
Marco and I will
go hit the town.

15:36.036 --> 15:39.003
As soon as we wash our hands.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.805
See?

15:40.807 --> 15:42.974
Good babysitter.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.043
(whispers): We're not
gonna wash our hands.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.111
Cool babysitter.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.114

Look at h.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.851
Fell asleep
in the car.

15:53.853 --> 15:56.321
Which is amazing because
he's had eight cokes.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.423
He's probably gonna
pee the bed.

15:58.425 --> 16:02.093
(gasps) Cleveland,
that is not my son!

16:02.095 --> 16:03.127
Say, huh?

16:03.129 --> 16:05.263
You brought me the
wrong Mexican kid!

16:05.265 --> 16:07.865
Do you think we all
look alike, you idiot?!

16:07.867 --> 16:10.935
Or maybe I'm the idiot for
thinking a racist like you

16:10.937 --> 16:12.103
could ever change!

16:12.105 --> 16:14.138
(door slamming)
You forgot your son!

16:14.140 --> 16:15.340
Oh.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.009
Good thing we all
have one of these.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.078
(leaf blower whirring)

16:26.118 --> 16:27.418
Okay, think, Cleveland.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.987
What did you do today?

16:28.989 --> 16:31.122
Retrace your steps.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.758
I know. We went
somewhere Spanish.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.760
Oh, you're
impossible!

16:35.762 --> 16:37.762
I'm finding
my son!

16:37.764 --> 16:39.097
No, I'm coming with.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.866

16:41.868 --> 16:43.668
There he is!

16:47.039 --> 16:49.507
Hey, Cecilia!

16:49.509 --> 16:52.043
I thought you were
supposed to be
out with Tyler.

16:52.045 --> 16:52.944
(sighs heavily)

16:52.946 --> 16:54.946
He didn't show.

16:54.948 --> 16:57.081
I'm just going to sit here
with the only people

16:57.083 --> 16:58.616
who seem to like me--

16:58.618 --> 17:02.286

17:08.294 --> 17:11.596
Are you going to
finish that corn dog?

17:11.598 --> 17:13.965
Well, this was the first
place I brought him.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.033
We watched that film

17:15.035 --> 17:17.368
about the history of
the woven blanket,

17:17.370 --> 17:20.438
<i>Still Scratchy</i>
<i>After All These Años.</i>

17:20.440 --> 17:21.973
Well, he's not here.

17:21.975 --> 17:23.207
I know.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.276
Should we keep looking
or should we give up?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.210
Testing you.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.478
You're a good mother.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.546
We keep looking.

17:28.548 --> 17:36.120

17:36.122 --> 17:38.022

17:38.024 --> 17:40.124
Oh, goodness, Junior.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.660
Did you hear that whole song?

17:42.662 --> 17:45.430
No, I came at the end,
but I think I get it.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.031
And that's
why I'm here.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.132
I brought something

17:49.335 --> 17:50.802
What? Oh, these?

17:50.804 --> 17:52.003
These are mine!

17:52.005 --> 17:54.138
I brought you
something else.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.339
Tyler?

17:55.341 --> 17:57.108
Junior, what's going on?

17:57.110 --> 17:59.110
I think I must have
accidentally told Tyler

17:59.112 --> 18:00.878
to go to the wrong food court.

18:00.880 --> 18:01.946
Right?

18:01.948 --> 18:04.415
Yeah. Okay. Right.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.616
(chuckling)

18:05.618 --> 18:09.087
Oh, Junior, you're
the sweetest boy.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.189
You're <i>also</i> sweet.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.492
(eyelid rattling)

18:14.494 --> 18:16.127
Just give me a second.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.029
I'm gonna go
freshen up in the lake.

18:18.031 --> 18:20.665
Hey, man, I appreciate what
you did just now because...

18:20.667 --> 18:22.200
Listen to me!
Oh, God.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.835
I'm your god.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.703
You're gonna
make her happy...

18:25.705 --> 18:26.938
but not too happy.

18:26.940 --> 18:27.972
Capisce?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.041
Remember, you're a good boy.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.110
You know what I mean
by "good boy"?

18:32.112 --> 18:33.945

Got it.
CECELIA:
I'm ready.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.513
Bye, Junior.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.281
Good-bye Tyler Hudson,

of 431 West 16th Street,
Apartment 4C,

18:40.253 --> 18:43.087
whose mother,
Gloria, gets home
from work at 5:20

18:43.089 --> 18:44.755
and hides a key
under the left potted plant

18:44.757 --> 18:45.957
on the front porch,

18:45.959 --> 18:47.959
and whose little brother
is allergic to peanuts!

18:47.961 --> 18:49.227
Bye!

(grunting)

18:52.432 --> 18:54.132

18:54.134 --> 18:59.036
Well, he wasn't at the
Hispanic Poetry Celebration.

18:59.038 --> 19:01.472
There once was a man
from Oaxaca.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.474
Who sure could play a maraca.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.311
But his wife wasn't happy,
'cause he gave her the clappy.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.881
And now he cries when he pees.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.115
(applause)

19:11.117 --> 19:14.018
And he wasn't
at the Ballet
Folklorico.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.087
♪

19:16.855 --> 19:18.923
(gunshots)

19:19.992 --> 19:21.325
Guess we'd better check

19:21.327 --> 19:25.029
the <i>Celebracion de la Cultura</i>
<i>Latina y Desfile del Orgullo.</i>

19:25.031 --> 19:26.631
Oh, who am I
kidding, Cleveland?

19:26.633 --> 19:28.032
He's not going
to be there.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.002
I think I know where he went.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.737
(clucking)

19:33.705 --> 19:35.773
(men shouting)

19:35.775 --> 19:37.508
A chicken auction?!

19:37.510 --> 19:39.810
Why do you think
Marco would be here?

19:39.812 --> 19:42.046
Because Marco likes
chicken auctions.

19:42.048 --> 19:45.850
But it's not like we come here
all the time

19:45.852 --> 19:47.285
or anything like that.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.686
Hey, Choni!

19:48.688 --> 19:50.087
Choni!

19:50.089 --> 19:52.123
(to tune of "La Bamba"):
♪ Para bailar, it's Choni

19:52.125 --> 19:53.090
♪ Para bailar, it's Choni

19:53.092 --> 19:54.091
♪ She's back again...

19:54.093 --> 19:55.960
Quiet!!

19:55.962 --> 19:58.462
We've got to find Marco!

19:58.464 --> 19:59.931
Marco?

19:59.933 --> 20:01.766
Marco?

20:01.768 --> 20:02.967
MARCO:
<i>Pollo!</i>

20:02.969 --> 20:04.769
<i>Pollo!</i>

20:05.971 --> 20:07.305
Marco!

20:07.307 --> 20:08.506
Where have you been?

20:08.508 --> 20:09.707
What happened?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.709
Well, when we were
at that boring museum,

20:11.711 --> 20:14.845
I went to the
bathroom...
<i>Baño.</i>

20:14.847 --> 20:16.781
I came out and
followed another man

20:16.783 --> 20:18.516
I thought was Mr.
Cleveland to his car.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.451
You know how you're always
saying that black people
all look alike...

20:20.453 --> 20:21.919
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:22.821 --> 20:26.090
Now who's
the racist, huh?

20:26.092 --> 20:27.291
<i>Tu es!</i>

20:27.293 --> 20:29.994
Cleveland, I don't care
what color you are.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.696
I just don't like you.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.697
You know what?

20:32.699 --> 20:33.998
I don't like you either.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.933
And it's not because
you're Mexican.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.868
It's partially
because you're a woman,

20:37.870 --> 20:40.972
but it's mainly because
you won't cut me any slack.

20:40.974 --> 20:46.344
Yes, I was ignorant about your
culture, but I am not a racist.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.478
(sighs)

20:47.480 --> 20:49.313
Maybe I've been
too hard on you.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.482
Maybe you're not
a racist dick.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.484
Maybe you're
just a dick.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.819
Thank you.

20:54.821 --> 20:58.089
So I guess I'm the mayor
of Grace Street after all!

20:58.091 --> 20:59.924
My oversized props, please.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.993
Ahh! Somebody
call a giant doctor!
