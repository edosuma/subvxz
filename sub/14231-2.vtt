12:20.657 --> 12:23.868
I knew it! Goof mud! And it's fresh!

12:23.952 --> 12:27.288
You've been hanging around
that goof kid, haven't ya?

12:27.831 --> 12:30.542
Well, don't you know what'll happen
if you get their germs on you?

12:30.625 --> 12:34.838
Why, your brain will shrink
to the size of a mustard seed!

12:34.921 --> 12:40.010
Strange words will start
creeping into your vocabulary,

12:40.093 --> 12:44.639

and "ah-hyuck, ah-hyuck."

12:44.723 --> 12:48.393
Ooh. And then you'll do
dumb things and then

12:48.476 --> 12:50.895

12:50.979 --> 12:53.648

-[P.J.] But...
-No buts, boy!

12:55.150 --> 12:57.152
You just steer clear of that kid.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.530
And get out of those
goof-infested clothes! Now!

13:00.613 --> 13:05.326
[P.J. sighs] Oh, well. At least I had
one day of fun in my life.

13:05.410 --> 13:09.205
Twenty-four wonderful, happening hours.

13:09.289 --> 13:13.209

to remember it by.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.712
Can it, P.J., I have a plan!

13:15.795 --> 13:17.922
-What'd you say?
-My plan is,

13:18.006 --> 13:21.801
-we'll come up with a plan!
-Of course, Max, that's it!

13:22.927 --> 13:26.056
-Do you really think that'll work?
-Trust me, Peej.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.185
[Pete] Forget it, Peg,
I'm the man of this house,

13:30.268 --> 13:32.937
and I say I'm not going
anywhere dressed like this.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.481
Hurry it up, Pete!

13:35.940 --> 13:37.776
Coming, toucan lips.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.944
[Goofy] Aloha!

13:40.028 --> 13:42.697
That there is Hawaiian for "aloha".

13:42.781 --> 13:45.033
[mocking Goofy]
"That's Hawaiian for 'aloha'."

13:45.116 --> 13:47.285
The boys went to a lot of trouble
over this,

13:47.369 --> 13:49.287
so you be good and enjoy yourself.

13:49.371 --> 13:53.333

Now me, mommy. Throw it to me.
I'm right here, here, here.

15:02.944 --> 15:06.114
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.783
[all] Go, Pete!

15:19.002 --> 15:21.796

15:21.921 --> 15:24.841
That's the same thing he did 25 years ago

15:24.924 --> 15:26.092
back in the big game!

15:26.676 --> 15:30.096
Oh, gawrsh, Pete, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to...

15:30.221 --> 15:33.725
If it wasn't for you,
I'd have won that game,

15:33.808 --> 15:35.977
and I'd have my own fish pond,

15:36.061 --> 15:38.355
instead of a bunch
of goofs living next door.

Uh, hey, what do you say me and Max
serve the main course now, huh?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.110
[Pete] Now, what do you say you get away

15:44.235 --> 15:45.820
from that dumb little goofing crud!

15:45.904 --> 15:48.698
Little? Why, my son's twice as tall

15:48.782 --> 15:51.159
as I was when I was only half his size!

15:51.242 --> 15:53.453
Come on, Max, we're leaving!

15:54.954 --> 15:55.789
Oh.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.376

Ah-hyuck. You get out!

16:04.547 --> 16:06.883
All right, here's the rules, Son.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.468
Learn them, love them and live them.

16:08.551 --> 16:12.263
Number one. No associating
whatsoever whosoever

16:12.347 --> 16:14.724
with any goof or any relative thereof,

16:14.849 --> 16:16.726
living, dead, or whatever otherwise.

16:16.851 --> 16:21.231
Number two. No setting of either one
of your feet on Pete's property.

16:21.356 --> 16:24.734
No walking on the same sidewalk
or breathing the same air as a goof.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.445
No bird watching of the same birds,

16:27.529 --> 16:28.905
no wearing of any of their clothes,

16:29.030 --> 16:30.990
and no doing Pete impressions.

16:31.116 --> 16:34.285
And last, most and utmostest,

16:34.369 --> 16:38.498
no mention of the "g" word
in this house at any time,

16:38.581 --> 16:41.668
under any circumstances. Understood?

16:41.751 --> 16:45.964
And lastly, but not leastly,
never stick peas up your nose.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.298
Is that clear, Maxie?

16:47.424 --> 16:49.509
[Max and P.J.] Yes, sir.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.930
[Max] Get over here, P.J. We got to talk.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.558
[P.J.] No can do, dude.
My dad's watching me.

-No sweat.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.569
OK, but why?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.112
It's the only way we can be friends!

17:09.237 --> 17:11.448
Oh, I don't know. I can't do that, Max.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.741
You're gonna have to, P.J.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.244
It's our only hope.
If you don't do this, we...

17:16.327 --> 17:19.289
I think you're getting the hang of it.

17:19.372 --> 17:23.835
Careful, son.
Don't get downwind of any goof germs.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.129
Get her spotless, Maxie.

17:26.254 --> 17:28.631
Don't want it looking like
that eyesore next door.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.468
Don't worry, Dad. I'll show them

17:31.593 --> 17:34.512
we don't take no guff off no goofs.

17:35.305 --> 17:39.642
What say, you make your tree drop its
leaves on its own yard, goof!

17:39.726 --> 17:43.313
Ooh. That's not bad.
I got to remember that one.

17:43.396 --> 17:47.442
What say, you keep the dust off the grime
on your house off our property!

17:47.567 --> 17:49.361
That's telling them, son!

17:49.486 --> 17:52.238
-But don't forget to say please.
-Oh, yeah?

17:52.322 --> 17:54.699
Well, if I ever caught you over here,

17:54.783 --> 17:57.494
oh, man, you know what I'd do?

son, but not the boat,

18:09.214 --> 18:10.674
just not, not the...

I'd take you and...
