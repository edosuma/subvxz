00:02.471 --> 00:03.377
<i> Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:03.479 --> 00:05.304
Mary Cooper...

00:05.406 --> 00:07.444
I want to sex you up.

00:08.483 --> 00:09.373
(gasps)

00:09.475 --> 00:11.013
I have good news.

00:11.115 --> 00:12.281
Good. I could use it.

00:12.383 --> 00:14.880
I got a job
at the bowling alley.

00:17.087 --> 00:18.116
Working with Brenda?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.319
Every day.

00:19.421 --> 00:21.795
I am so sorry
about today.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.553
I just hate to
see you walk away

00:23.655 --> 00:24.994
from the Lord.
Feels like

00:25.096 --> 00:26.991
He's walking away from me.

00:34.642 --> 00:35.542
What is that?

00:35.644 --> 00:36.809
Hamburger Helper.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.742
It's official.
We're poor.

00:38.844 --> 00:40.438
We're not poor.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.815
There's hamburger in there.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.543
There's hamburger
in there, right?

00:43.645 --> 00:45.547
(grunts softly)
I like Hamburger Helper.

00:45.649 --> 00:47.547
It really does help your
hamburger make a great meal.

00:47.649 --> 00:48.755
Well, it's a good thing
you like it,

00:48.857 --> 00:50.283
'cause you're definitely poor.

00:50.385 --> 00:52.153
Like us.
We're fine.

00:52.255 --> 00:54.156
Actually...
Just eat.

00:54.258 --> 00:56.261
Do we still say grace?
Why not?

00:56.363 --> 00:58.966
Mom's been taking a break
from the church. Mom?

00:59.068 --> 01:01.634
Well, I hadn't really
thought about it.

01:01.736 --> 01:03.062
We can if you want to.

01:03.165 --> 01:04.099
Let's not.

01:04.201 --> 01:05.332
As meaningless as it is,

01:05.434 --> 01:06.999
I do find the ritual comforting.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.570
Well, somebody make a decision.
That slop's getting cold.

01:09.672 --> 01:12.040
No, it's good cold or hot,
like Grape-Nuts.

01:12.142 --> 01:13.170
Ooh, can I say it?

01:13.272 --> 01:14.775
Sure.

01:16.278 --> 01:17.712
(Missy clears throat)

01:17.814 --> 01:19.645
Bless us Lord for the food
we are about to receive

01:19.747 --> 01:21.344
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

01:22.214 --> 01:24.084
And let me have a good
hair day for school pictures

01:24.186 --> 01:25.654
later this week.

01:25.756 --> 01:27.852
(sighs) Let's see, what else
do I want...
Wrap it up.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.796
And please let my dad
find a full-time job

01:29.898 --> 01:31.256
before we lose cable. Amen.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.658
OTHERS: Amen.

So...

01:58.851 --> 02:00.494
how's it going
with this whole

02:00.596 --> 02:02.427
no church thing?

02:03.193 --> 02:04.522
It's a little weird,

02:04.624 --> 02:06.095
but I'm figuring it out.

02:06.197 --> 02:07.927
Think you might go back?

02:09.067 --> 02:10.364
I don't know yet.

02:10.466 --> 02:11.968
Maybe find a different church?

02:12.070 --> 02:14.637
I don't know, George.

02:16.405 --> 02:18.269
I'm gonna get a beer.

02:18.371 --> 02:19.371
You, uh,

02:19.473 --> 02:20.780
care to join me

02:20.882 --> 02:22.081
like the good ol' days?

02:22.183 --> 02:23.841
Just 'cause
I'm not going to church

02:23.943 --> 02:25.983
doesn't mean
I'm suddenly a drinker.

02:26.085 --> 02:27.449
Okay. Well, then I guess

02:27.551 --> 02:29.454
me and my friends
will say goodnight.

02:32.287 --> 02:33.252
We need to talk.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.622
About what?

02:34.724 --> 02:37.391
You do their taxes.
How bad off are we?

02:37.493 --> 02:39.025
Based on their part-time income,

02:39.127 --> 02:40.791
we're going to run out of money
by the end of the year.

02:40.893 --> 02:43.033
Before or after Christmas?
Before.

02:43.135 --> 02:45.096
Not what I wanted to hear.

02:46.141 --> 02:48.666
(sighs)
Anything we can do to help?

02:48.768 --> 02:50.677
Perhaps we could sell our stuff.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.042
But I like my stuff.

02:52.144 --> 02:53.537
I like my stuff, too.

02:53.639 --> 02:55.477
Let's keep thinking.

02:55.579 --> 02:57.042
<i> (phone rings)</i>
<i> (laughter over TV)</i>

02:59.248 --> 03:01.279
(TV mutes)

03:01.381 --> 03:02.415
Hello?

03:02.517 --> 03:04.415
Connie. Grant Linkletter.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.287
Hello, Grant.

03:06.389 --> 03:08.120
What can I do for you?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.490
Well, I looked at my calendar
and realized it's been six weeks

03:10.592 --> 03:12.098
since I last asked you out, so

03:12.200 --> 03:13.493
I thought I'd give it
another shot.

03:13.596 --> 03:15.764
You ask me out every six weeks?

03:15.866 --> 03:19.031
Used to be nine, but
we're not getting any younger.

03:20.238 --> 03:22.300
I'll tell you what...

03:22.402 --> 03:23.303
fine.

03:23.405 --> 03:25.206
Really?
Why not?

03:25.308 --> 03:26.604
(laughs)
Excellent.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.005
But I want to be clear,

03:28.108 --> 03:30.211
this is just one of those--
whatcha call it--

03:30.313 --> 03:32.148
uh, platonic things.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.587
We're just having dinner.

03:33.689 --> 03:34.846
I'll take it.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.449
Now, would you prefer
a restaurant

03:36.551 --> 03:38.188
or some good home cooking?

03:38.290 --> 03:39.786
I make seven kinds of soup.

03:39.888 --> 03:41.386
I think I'll just stick
with a restaurant.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.387
Fair enough,

03:42.489 --> 03:43.457
but one day,

03:43.559 --> 03:44.557
you'll try my mushroom barley,

03:44.660 --> 03:46.458
and your taste buds will swoon.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.592
Good night, Grant.

03:47.694 --> 03:48.592
The secret is how long

03:48.694 --> 03:49.963
I cook the onions.

03:58.275 --> 04:00.075
Chicken coop, now.

04:00.177 --> 04:01.777
(door closes)

04:04.443 --> 04:05.378
Hi.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.819
What are we doing?

04:06.921 --> 04:08.414
What are you doing?

04:08.516 --> 04:09.813
What, you hired Mary

04:09.916 --> 04:11.549
to work at the
bowling alley.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.760
She needed a job.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.085
I was being nice.

04:15.187 --> 04:16.621
Well, you don't think
it's a little weird?

04:16.723 --> 04:19.128
(scoffs)
This right here--

04:19.230 --> 04:20.626
it's all weird.

04:20.729 --> 04:22.769
(scoffs)
(sighs) Are you drunk?

04:22.871 --> 04:24.966
Not nearly enough.

04:25.068 --> 04:28.039
You and Mary working together
is a bad idea considering...

04:28.141 --> 04:30.406
you know,
you and me.

04:30.508 --> 04:32.103
We haven't done
anything, George.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.113
But there was considering.
You know there was.

04:34.215 --> 04:36.476
(scoffs)
What do you want me to do?

04:36.578 --> 04:37.642
You want me to fire her?

04:37.744 --> 04:40.110
No, no.
That'd be weird.

04:40.213 --> 04:43.984
Which is exactly
where we started. Good night.

04:46.555 --> 04:48.362
(sighs)
(door closes)

04:49.659 --> 04:51.827
You understand what I'm saying.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.131
Okay, so what are you good at?

04:56.233 --> 04:57.529
I'm popular.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.938
That is not a skill.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.831
You can't do it.
Fine.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.838
Oh, you could go on<i> Jeopardy!</i>

05:02.940 --> 05:05.336
Never. I don't like answers
in the form of questions.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.807
I like my answers in the form
of answers, and my questions

05:07.909 --> 05:09.215
in the form of
questions, thank you.

05:09.317 --> 05:11.611
Ooh, perhaps I could
sell story ideas

05:11.713 --> 05:13.044
to TV shows like<i> Star Trek.</i>

05:13.147 --> 05:14.955
Do you really think
they'd listen to a kid?

05:15.057 --> 05:16.288
My voice has gotten deeper.

05:16.390 --> 05:17.784
The other day,
I answered the phone,

05:17.886 --> 05:19.359
and they didn't
mistake me for Mom.

05:19.461 --> 05:21.554
<i> Star Trek's</i> not gonna
buy your stupid ideas.

05:21.656 --> 05:22.688
We'll see about that.

05:22.791 --> 05:23.721
I have one where the<i> Enterprise</i>

05:23.823 --> 05:24.865
falls into a time tunnel,

05:24.967 --> 05:25.922
and Worf becomes a Worf

05:26.024 --> 05:27.432
from 12 minutes in the future.

05:27.534 --> 05:30.030
We could let people
punch you for a buck.

05:30.132 --> 05:33.297
No, all our profit would just
go to medical expenses.

05:39.147 --> 05:41.710
Hey, Brenda,
I was trying to

05:41.813 --> 05:43.612
do the books for the quarter,
and I was having

05:43.714 --> 05:45.346
a little trouble
making sense of it.

05:45.448 --> 05:46.646
You know, Mary, if...

05:46.748 --> 05:48.718
if it's too big
of a mess, and

05:48.820 --> 05:51.584
you'd rather work
somewhere else, I'd understand.

05:51.686 --> 05:53.626
No, I'll figure it out.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.862
Great.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.356
So happy you're here.

05:57.459 --> 05:59.356
(chuckles)

06:03.168 --> 06:04.298
Hey, there.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.332
Oh. (chuckles)

06:06.434 --> 06:07.333
Hi, Mary.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.803
(laughs)

06:08.906 --> 06:11.038
Finally found an eight-pounder
that's not pink.

06:12.014 --> 06:13.046
I didn't know you bowled.

06:13.148 --> 06:15.408
I didn't know you did either.

06:15.510 --> 06:17.608
Actually, I, um,

06:17.710 --> 06:19.247
I work here now.

06:19.349 --> 06:21.555
Oh, sure, okay.

06:21.657 --> 06:22.646
I...

06:22.748 --> 06:25.286
I'm so sorry

06:25.388 --> 06:27.256
about how things

06:27.358 --> 06:29.024
went down at church.

06:29.126 --> 06:31.557
If it helps at all, the place
has gone to heck since you left.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.766
Good.
(chuckles)

06:33.869 --> 06:35.359
(chuckles)

06:36.600 --> 06:38.764
I sure do miss working with you.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.503
Well, we can still be friends,

06:41.606 --> 06:43.477
even if we don't work together.

06:44.671 --> 06:45.744
I'd like that.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.774
You find a
kiddie ball yet?

06:47.876 --> 06:49.949
It's not about
the weight, just...

06:50.051 --> 06:51.909
I have small fingers.

06:52.011 --> 06:54.711
Oh, uh, Mary,
this is Shannon.

06:54.813 --> 06:55.779
Shannon, this is

06:55.881 --> 06:57.915
Mary Cooper.
Hi.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.720
You used to be
Mary Tucker.

06:59.822 --> 07:02.389
Oh, not in a long time.
(laughs)

07:02.491 --> 07:03.554
You remember me?

07:03.657 --> 07:05.397
Sorry, no.

07:05.499 --> 07:08.964
Shannon Dixon.
You used to babysit me.

07:10.004 --> 07:11.300
Is that so?

07:11.402 --> 07:12.438
She was so great.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.198
She would let me stay
up late and watch TV

07:14.300 --> 07:16.172
while she would make out
with her boyfriend.

07:16.274 --> 07:17.210
(Mary laughs)

07:17.312 --> 07:19.878
I don't...
remember any of that.

07:19.980 --> 07:22.071
Oh, I'm not surprised. You used
to hit my dad's liquor cabinet

07:22.174 --> 07:24.747
pretty hard.
Well, Mary Cooper.

07:24.849 --> 07:27.680
I was... young
and hadn't found the Lord.

07:27.782 --> 07:31.151
You two have a great time.

07:40.233 --> 07:41.460
Here's that invoice.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.597
Oh. Great.

07:42.699 --> 07:44.597
I see Pastor Rob's
here again.

07:44.699 --> 07:46.864
Oh, does, uh...

07:46.966 --> 07:49.470
does he come
here often?

07:49.572 --> 07:51.206
Not with that one.

07:51.309 --> 07:52.810
She's new.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.346
Well, good for him.

07:56.448 --> 07:58.777
Single, good-looking pastor.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.319
In a small town like this,

08:00.421 --> 08:02.248
he might as well
be Roger Staubach.

08:04.623 --> 08:06.487
Oh, my God.
The Dallas Cowboys.

08:06.589 --> 08:08.359
Oh, sure, course.

08:08.461 --> 08:10.253
Um... hey,
if you need me,

08:10.355 --> 08:12.756
I'm gonna be in
the office doing...

08:12.858 --> 08:14.634
office things.

08:20.637 --> 08:21.635
What are you doing here?

08:21.737 --> 08:23.200
I ran out of beer at home,

08:23.302 --> 08:25.038
didn't feel like
driving to the store.

08:25.141 --> 08:27.409
Oh, so you just
waltz in and help yourself?

08:27.511 --> 08:29.445
'Bout sums it up.

08:29.547 --> 08:31.445
I'm changing the locks.

08:31.547 --> 08:34.148
(laughs) Cheers.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.652
So, how's my daughter doing?

08:39.754 --> 08:41.251
Eh, she seems okay.

08:41.353 --> 08:43.089
Still trying to
figure things out.

08:43.191 --> 08:45.695
I got to be honest,
I'm not exactly upset

08:45.797 --> 08:47.462
about less religion
in the house.

08:47.564 --> 08:49.501
(chuckles) I hear you.

08:49.603 --> 08:51.536
Although, Jesus
making her forgive me

08:51.638 --> 08:53.871
has come in handy
more than a few times.

08:53.973 --> 08:56.739
(chuckles) Yeah, I
played that card, too.
(chuckles)

08:56.841 --> 08:59.442
Then again,
I remember Mary before God

08:59.544 --> 09:00.973
got His mitts on her, and...

09:01.075 --> 09:03.677
(chuckles)
...she was pretty wild.

09:03.779 --> 09:05.549
Don't have to tell me.

09:05.651 --> 09:06.948
I was the person
she was wild with.

09:07.050 --> 09:10.221
Oh, she was wild
long before she ever met you.

09:10.323 --> 09:11.552
What do you mean?

09:12.555 --> 09:16.292
Did you think that you were the
first person she was wild with?

09:16.394 --> 09:19.633
Well... yeah.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.865
And just when the<i> Enterprise</i>
is about to be

09:26.967 --> 09:28.299
assimilated by the Borg,

09:28.402 --> 09:31.773
another ship appears,
piloted by Wesley Crusher.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.743
Uh-huh.
It's surprising because

09:33.845 --> 09:35.378
Wesley Crusher left the show
years ago,

09:35.480 --> 09:36.477
so it's a big deal.

09:36.579 --> 09:37.712
If you say so.

09:37.814 --> 09:39.012
I have more. Commander Data...

09:39.114 --> 09:41.450
I'd like a reservation
for dinner.

09:41.552 --> 09:42.719
Yes, I'll hold.

09:42.821 --> 09:44.656
You want to do this over dinner?
Okay.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.853
I'm taking your grandmother
out tonight.

09:46.955 --> 09:48.384
She didn't mention it to me.

09:48.486 --> 09:50.790
Maybe because
it doesn't concern you.

09:50.892 --> 09:52.190
My meemaw, my professor--

09:52.292 --> 09:54.926
who's in the middle
of that Venn diagram?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.797
Yes, two people at 8:00.

09:56.899 --> 09:58.733
8:00's a little late for Meemaw.

09:58.836 --> 10:00.398
What time does she like to eat?

10:00.500 --> 10:03.134
Well, she's old like you,
so 6:30 at the latest.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.873
Can we make that 6:30?
Wonderful.

10:05.975 --> 10:08.847
Hold on.
Does she like French food?

10:09.646 --> 10:11.943
I'll call you back.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.148
Anyway, Commander Data...

10:14.250 --> 10:16.317
Let me ask you a question,
if this Commander Data

10:16.419 --> 10:19.490
were taking your meemaw out
for dinner, where would they go?

10:19.592 --> 10:21.225
Almost certainly the holodeck.

10:21.327 --> 10:22.854
Sounds trendy.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.731
Is that in Houston?

10:28.333 --> 10:29.298
Hello.

10:29.401 --> 10:30.633
What's up?

10:30.735 --> 10:32.436
I saw your "help wanted" sign.

10:32.538 --> 10:33.633
I'd like to help, please.

10:33.735 --> 10:34.768
How old are you?

10:34.870 --> 10:36.502
How old do I need to be?

10:36.604 --> 10:37.540
14.

10:37.642 --> 10:39.575
(scoffs)
Do I not look 14?

10:39.677 --> 10:41.708
I don't care.
Perfect.

10:41.810 --> 10:43.210
So, when do I start?

10:43.312 --> 10:45.644
All right, hold on, do
you even like comic books?

10:45.746 --> 10:46.714
Yeah.

10:46.816 --> 10:47.985
What's your favorite?

10:49.222 --> 10:50.249
Um...

10:50.351 --> 10:52.591
And the cool thing
about the X-Men is not just

10:52.693 --> 10:53.656
that they have superpowers,
but they act

10:53.758 --> 10:55.189
as a metaphor for outsiders...

10:55.291 --> 10:57.790
...outsiders trying to find
their place in society.

10:57.892 --> 10:59.427
Who's your favorite?

10:59.530 --> 11:01.097
All of them.

11:02.368 --> 11:03.268
Mine, too.

11:03.370 --> 11:04.669
And I got the job.

11:04.771 --> 11:06.067
You can't work
at the comic book store.

11:06.169 --> 11:07.535
If anyone should work
at the comic book store,

11:07.637 --> 11:08.538
it should be me.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.936
Sorry, we're not hiring.

11:10.038 --> 11:11.538
Do I at least get a discount?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.241
I do.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.145
(muffled crying)

11:20.520 --> 11:22.551
Oh, hey, hi.
(sniffles)

11:22.653 --> 11:25.022
Oh... You okay?

11:25.985 --> 11:27.252
Not really.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.425
It's been a...
rough couple of days.

11:30.528 --> 11:32.295
I'm sorry.

11:32.398 --> 11:33.497
Thank you.

11:33.599 --> 11:34.831
Makes you feel better,

11:34.933 --> 11:36.193
I've had a pretty good
couple of days,

11:36.295 --> 11:37.762
and I'm still gonna get drunk.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.567
(laughs)

11:39.669 --> 11:41.269
Want to join me?

11:42.703 --> 11:43.935
Yes.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.607
That would be nice.

11:45.709 --> 11:46.973
More sad than nice,

11:47.075 --> 11:49.244
but let's go.
(chuckles) Okay.

11:54.246 --> 11:55.520
So... this is unexpected.

11:55.623 --> 11:57.922
Well, I know you
like margaritas,

11:58.024 --> 11:59.884
so my first thought was
a Mexican restaurant.

11:59.986 --> 12:00.922
Good thought.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.262
But I assumed
other men had come

12:02.364 --> 12:03.663
to that same conclusion.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.664
They have.
Which led me to
Polynesian fare.

12:06.766 --> 12:08.601
I like to think
of the Mai Tai

12:08.703 --> 12:11.395
as the margarita
of the South Pacific.

12:11.497 --> 12:14.264
You don't do anything
on a whim, do you?

12:14.366 --> 12:16.337
Did once,
didn't like it.

12:18.379 --> 12:19.409
(TV playing faintly)

12:19.511 --> 12:20.512
I have an idea

12:20.614 --> 12:21.546
for a<i> Star Trek</i> episode

12:21.648 --> 12:22.741
I'd like to present to you.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.142
Why me?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.642
Because I'm hoping to sell it,

12:25.744 --> 12:27.249
and since it's going to be
broadcast television,

12:27.351 --> 12:29.580
I want to make sure the
common man can understand it.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.987
(scoffs) Well, I understand
I was just insulted.

12:32.089 --> 12:34.350
Excellent, I came
to the right common man.

12:34.453 --> 12:35.728
(TV clicks off)
We start on

12:35.830 --> 12:38.265
a gas giant in the vicinity
of Rigel IV,

12:38.367 --> 12:39.833
then see a shuttlecraft,

12:39.935 --> 12:42.929
a dot of silver against
the inky blackness of space.

12:43.031 --> 12:44.429
Inside the shuttlecraft,

12:44.532 --> 12:46.840
we see Lieutenant Worf
struggling to breathe.

12:46.942 --> 12:50.268
He's been infected by
a vicious intelligent fungus.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.178
Where are you going?
I'm listening.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.302
Cough, cough.

12:53.404 --> 12:55.241
Worf is choking on spores,

12:55.343 --> 12:56.878
but not just your
everyday spores,

12:56.981 --> 12:58.483
these are spores with their own

12:58.585 --> 12:59.812
evil agenda.
Uh-huh.

12:59.914 --> 13:00.684
And, as he sinks

13:00.786 --> 13:02.245
into a coma, a mysterious figure

13:02.347 --> 13:03.713
in a spacesuit approaches.

13:03.815 --> 13:05.722
He lowers the visor
of his helmet revealing...

13:05.824 --> 13:07.324
Future Worf. Are you hooked?

13:07.427 --> 13:09.052
Oh, yeah.

13:09.154 --> 13:10.355
Main titles.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.962
Cue theme song and
the soothing voice

13:12.064 --> 13:15.066
of Patrick Stewart
as Captain Picard says...

13:16.568 --> 13:18.531
"Space..."

13:19.606 --> 13:21.605
"...the final frontier."

13:21.707 --> 13:24.537
Who's Patrick Stewart?

13:27.340 --> 13:28.812
Feeling better?
I'm fine,

13:28.914 --> 13:31.084
just having
a little moment earlier.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.217
Oh, yeah.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.217
All right.

13:33.319 --> 13:34.680
Mm.

13:34.782 --> 13:35.946
Mmm.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.418
♪ ♪

13:38.718 --> 13:41.728
Seems like running into
Pastor Rob kind of...

13:41.830 --> 13:43.229
kind of rattled you
a little bit. (chuckles)

13:43.331 --> 13:45.723
Oh, well...

13:46.931 --> 13:48.732
I was asked to leave the church,

13:48.834 --> 13:51.494
and he's still there, so...

13:51.596 --> 13:53.372
it's still a little fresh.
Mm.

13:53.474 --> 13:55.906
Yeah, I get that.

13:56.008 --> 13:58.244
Seems like a nice guy, though.
Oh, yeah,

13:58.346 --> 13:59.642
he's great.

13:59.744 --> 14:01.411
Cute as a button.

14:01.513 --> 14:03.416
I guess.

14:03.518 --> 14:06.010
I prefer a bigger man.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.652
Like George?

14:07.754 --> 14:10.616
Oh, yeah.
Bigger the better.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.052
Deep within the<i> Enterprise's</i>
control room,

14:14.154 --> 14:15.154
Future Worf says,

14:15.256 --> 14:16.595
"I willingly sacrifice myself

14:16.697 --> 14:17.995
for the good of this mission,"

14:18.097 --> 14:19.830
then throws himself
into the warp core.

14:19.932 --> 14:21.562
There's an explosion
of tachyons.

14:21.664 --> 14:25.061
The<i> Enterprise</i> blasts free
of the gigantic field of fungus.

14:25.163 --> 14:26.063
Fade out.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.298
(toilet flushes)

14:27.400 --> 14:29.635
Written by Sheldon Lee Cooper.

14:30.643 --> 14:32.409
What do you think?

14:33.212 --> 14:36.441
If this Worf fella
was infected on the shuttles,

14:36.543 --> 14:37.880
why would he come back
to the<i> Enterprise</i>

14:37.982 --> 14:39.612
and put everyone else in danger?

14:40.420 --> 14:42.253
Well...

14:42.355 --> 14:45.250
ADULT SHELDON:
<i> My father found a flaw</i>
<i> in my story,</i>

14:45.353 --> 14:47.221
<i> my sister had a job I envied.</i>

14:47.323 --> 14:49.859
<i> It was a big day</i>
<i> for the common man.</i>

14:49.961 --> 14:52.095
<i> But then I had an idea that,</i>

14:52.198 --> 14:54.466
<i> like Future Worf,</i>
<i> was ahead of its time.</i>

14:54.568 --> 14:55.534
(knock on door)

14:55.636 --> 14:57.098
SHELDON: Missy.
What?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.704
Why is a dollar
worth a dollar?

14:59.806 --> 15:01.369
(sighs)
Sheldon, I'm busy.

15:01.471 --> 15:03.205
Me too. I've solved
all of our money problems.

15:03.307 --> 15:05.511
I'm going to invent
my own digital currency.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.112
Like, printing your own?

15:07.214 --> 15:09.848
No. First, we assign value
to difficult-to-find numbers

15:09.950 --> 15:11.280
and store them
in a computer database.

15:11.382 --> 15:13.315
Then we create an algorithm
to mine the numbers,

15:13.417 --> 15:15.446
then we encourage people
to switch from currencies

15:15.548 --> 15:17.189
that are government-backed
to ours.

15:17.992 --> 15:19.919
It's brilliant.
I'm going to be rich.

15:20.021 --> 15:21.390
Speaking of,

15:21.492 --> 15:24.522
did you know Batman
is also secretly a rich dude?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.763
Or he lives in
a rich dude's basement.

15:26.865 --> 15:28.399
I'm still figuring it out.

15:28.501 --> 15:29.893
(sighs)

15:32.630 --> 15:34.833
Oh, thank you,
tiki woman.

15:34.935 --> 15:35.673
So...

15:35.775 --> 15:37.272
what's going on at work?

15:37.374 --> 15:39.204
I don't want to bore you
with science talk.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.739
No, no, I'm interested.

15:40.841 --> 15:43.312
Excellent. We're in a race
with the Finnish team to see

15:43.414 --> 15:45.677
who can correct the
unification of the leptons.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.316
As you can imagine, the
world waits anxiously

15:48.419 --> 15:50.746
while we see who crosses
the finish line first.

15:50.848 --> 15:53.083
So, the Finnish
may be at the finish line?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.226
(laughing)

15:56.697 --> 15:58.488
Oh, you're witty, too.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.292
More cheese to bait the trap.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.559
Maybe we should order dinner.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.699
Nonsense,
there's food right here.

16:04.802 --> 16:05.703
Pineapple,

16:05.805 --> 16:07.903
prickly on the outside,

16:08.005 --> 16:09.639
but beautiful inside,

16:09.741 --> 16:11.869
just like you.

16:15.609 --> 16:17.449
And you know that
Shannon girl...

16:17.551 --> 16:18.682
With Pastor Rob?

16:18.784 --> 16:21.111
She was a bedwetter.

16:21.213 --> 16:22.113
(laughs)

16:22.215 --> 16:23.247
Ten years old.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.582
That's not normal.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.854
Maybe he'll get
a fun little surprise

16:25.956 --> 16:27.090
on their honeymoon.

16:27.192 --> 16:29.925
Oh, no, they're not
getting married.

16:30.027 --> 16:31.156
Well, how do you know?

16:31.258 --> 16:32.589
(scoffs) I don't.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.859
I just think he
could do better.

16:35.635 --> 16:38.164
Mary Cooper.

16:38.266 --> 16:40.031
Are you sweet on him?

16:40.134 --> 16:41.805
No! What?

16:41.907 --> 16:44.871
I am a married woman.

16:44.973 --> 16:46.344
Happily.

16:46.446 --> 16:48.581
Well, I was married once, too,
didn't stop me from looking.

16:48.683 --> 16:50.710
Well, I'm not looking.

16:51.651 --> 16:53.044
Where you going?

16:53.146 --> 16:54.150
To dance.

16:54.252 --> 16:55.687
I didn't think
you Baptists did that.

16:55.789 --> 16:57.179
We don't drink, neither.

16:57.281 --> 16:58.557
Ooh!

16:58.659 --> 17:00.360
Look at me. Ooh!
Wow.

17:00.462 --> 17:02.318
(Mary laughs)

17:02.420 --> 17:04.554
I'm pretty good.

17:04.657 --> 17:05.964
Are you familiar
with the phrase,

17:06.066 --> 17:08.233
"You need money to make money"?
No.

17:08.335 --> 17:10.969
Well, it's a phrase,
and my clever twist on it is,

17:11.071 --> 17:13.438
"I'm going to make money
to make money."

17:13.540 --> 17:14.965
Mm-hmm.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.305
Now, when I say "make money,"
you might think that

17:16.407 --> 17:18.275
I'm talking about
counterfeiting, but no,

17:18.377 --> 17:20.738
I'm talking about creating
a unique decentralized

17:20.840 --> 17:22.779
digital currency
that people can pay to own.

17:22.881 --> 17:23.914
Sounds like a scam.

17:24.017 --> 17:25.842
No, it's an
open-source currency

17:25.944 --> 17:27.983
that has value
due to mathematical scarcity.

17:28.085 --> 17:29.722
Sounds pretty scammy.

17:29.825 --> 17:31.181
(scoffs)
You don't understand.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.354
I do.

17:32.456 --> 17:33.989
You say a bunch
of fancy jibber-jabber,

17:34.091 --> 17:35.223
people don't want to admit

17:35.325 --> 17:36.520
they're too stupid
to understand,

17:36.623 --> 17:37.487
then they give you their money.

17:37.589 --> 17:40.062
Well... um... sort of.

17:40.165 --> 17:42.264
Love it.
How do we get started?

17:42.366 --> 17:44.996
Well, all we need
is a mainframe computer.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.732
How much is that?
New, about
half a million dollars,

17:47.835 --> 17:50.374
but I'm hoping to find
something slightly used.

17:51.141 --> 17:53.443
Time will prove me right.

17:55.213 --> 17:56.575
You're not gonna
believe this,

17:56.677 --> 17:57.976
but I don't go on
a lot of dates.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.209
No.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.920
It's true.

18:01.022 --> 18:03.018
Sure, I did okay as
a younger man, but

18:03.120 --> 18:04.848
there was a war on and

18:04.951 --> 18:06.485
most of the able-bodied
men were elsewhere.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.628
So, you sowed some oats,
I get it.

18:08.730 --> 18:09.895
A whole field of them.

18:09.997 --> 18:11.761
I was the Johnny
Appleseed of oats.

18:11.863 --> 18:12.830
Okay.
(laughs)

18:12.932 --> 18:15.024
But here's the thing.

18:15.126 --> 18:18.094
Once you put off matrimony
past a certain point,

18:18.196 --> 18:20.936
women start to think of you
as... What's the word?

18:21.038 --> 18:23.500
Creepy?
There it is.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.272
And then along comes you,

18:25.375 --> 18:27.042
my little
Texas firecracker,

18:27.144 --> 18:28.373
playing the
game of life

18:28.475 --> 18:29.805
by her own set of rules.

18:29.907 --> 18:33.111
I'm a firecracker,
I'm a pineapple...

18:33.214 --> 18:34.250
Good for me.

18:34.352 --> 18:36.282
Can I ask you
a personal question?

18:36.384 --> 18:37.381
Oh, I wish you wouldn't.

18:37.483 --> 18:38.416
How would you like

18:38.518 --> 18:39.849
to make love to a man

18:39.951 --> 18:41.792
who shook the hand
of Albert Einstein?

18:41.894 --> 18:43.552
And... you did.

18:43.654 --> 18:45.732
This one right here.

18:45.834 --> 18:46.929
I didn't wash it for a week.

18:47.031 --> 18:48.762
Not a selling point.

18:50.035 --> 18:52.271
Excuse me for a moment.

18:53.071 --> 18:55.274
I have to toss my cookies.

18:58.772 --> 19:00.137
(door closes)
(TV playing faintly)

19:00.239 --> 19:01.375
Hey.

19:01.477 --> 19:02.848
Where you been?
(TV clicks off)

19:02.950 --> 19:05.816
Brenda and I
went dancing.

19:05.918 --> 19:07.611
You went dancing?

19:07.714 --> 19:10.556
Yeah, and I'm
darn good at it.

19:10.658 --> 19:12.148
(chuckles) Okay.

19:13.091 --> 19:15.426
The kids asleep?
Yep.

19:16.490 --> 19:19.265
You want to fool around?

19:20.659 --> 19:21.567
Are you messing with me?

19:21.669 --> 19:23.764
I'm hoping to.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.865
Well, hot diggity dog.

19:33.048 --> 19:35.071
Welcome to King Kong Comics.
I'm Missy.

19:35.173 --> 19:36.816
If you have any questions,
please let me know.

19:36.918 --> 19:38.150
I don't have
any questions.

19:38.252 --> 19:39.810
I know more about
comic books than you do.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.019
Okay. What you
may not know is the new

19:42.121 --> 19:43.589
Green Lantern just came in.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.719
Also, if you like green things,
I recommend Green Arrow,

19:46.821 --> 19:48.851
and, of course, the Hulk.
His skin is green.

19:48.953 --> 19:50.689
I know that.
Everyone knows that.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.892
Uh-oh, are you gonna
smash things?

19:52.994 --> 19:54.732
That's something the Hulk does
when he gets upset.

19:54.834 --> 19:55.901
I'm not upset.

19:56.004 --> 19:57.334
Cool.
If you need something,

19:57.437 --> 19:59.932
I'll be at the front counter.
Where I work.
