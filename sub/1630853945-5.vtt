00:12.813 --> 00:14.813
What do you think? You wanna
sit down and have a meal?

00:20.121 --> 00:22.221
[wes] it's not gonna do
a whole lot for us.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.424
I do feel like we're getting
down to it

00:25.426 --> 00:27.826
Where we have to have
some food, some protein,

00:28.729 --> 00:30.529
Even if it's small amounts.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.464
[jermaine] cook them
or eat them raw?

00:32.533 --> 00:33.832
I think sit right here
and eat them

00:33.901 --> 00:35.034
Until you don't want
to anymore.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.402
[wes] I'll go with that.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.408
[spits and groans]

00:42.410 --> 00:44.510
[laughs and spits]

00:44.512 --> 00:47.012
That's nothing tasty
about that at all.

00:47.014 --> 00:50.349

00:54.055 --> 00:57.189
That sucks, man.
I was so excited about that.

00:57.191 --> 01:00.025
[wes] <i> my number one surviva</i>

01:00.027 --> 01:02.061

-I don't have a problem
with this right here at all.
-It's crazy.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.098
I really don't like it.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.033
It's small wins.

01:08.035 --> 01:11.437
I think there are about 10,000
small wins in this whole pile.

01:11.538 --> 01:12.805
Hmm.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.819
-You eating the bone marrow?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:26.821 --> 01:27.953
Hey, that's good for you.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.988

A coyote. Doesn't seem like
it's been dead that long.

That's the last of the meat.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.803
-[waz] that's a problem.
-Yeah.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.608
The next kinda push forward
is gonna be

01:49.610 --> 01:51.043
Tackling the fish.
We're getting 'em.

[waz] <i> I'm making</i>

we call them yabbies.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.328
[sara] are you gonna bait it
with coyote stuff?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.363
Yeah, I've already got
coyote kidney in there.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.597
[sarah] awesome.

[waz] <i> these rocks are</i>

Under this ledge.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.115
All right, so that's
sat off nicely there.

02:30.117 --> 02:33.819
My feet are at a pretty harsh
sting right now.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.421
So I'm gonna head back over,
get these feet by the fire

02:36.423 --> 02:37.456
And warm up a little bit.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.095
Think if we can get
some of these trout,

02:43.097 --> 02:44.329
It's gonna boost everything.

02:44.331 --> 02:48.000
How am I supposed to get over
there without getting wet?

02:48.002 --> 02:51.103
<i> Why I hate this weather</i>
<i> so freaking much,</i>

02:51.105 --> 02:53.138
No matter how much water
I'm drinking,

It's like my skin's
getting dryer,

Waiting for the sun
to beat the wind.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.044
That's well described
right there.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.012
[jermaine] I'll go
check the snares.

03:35.516 --> 03:39.318

The open, honest
communication, dude.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.925
I'd much rather that you have
this conversation with me

just sit there and boil in it.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.628

did you notice that?

05:47.647 --> 05:49.047
[jeremy] yeah, I notice it.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.818
I know a lot of times grub
gets in these rotten logs.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.219
If we can find some grubs

05:54.221 --> 05:56.188
Then we might be able
to catch a fish.

If we can't catch
a fish on grubs,

05:57.958 --> 05:59.224

10:46.212 --> 10:48.113
Less than 50 feet
from the shelter.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.515
-[wes] looks like
he's checking us out.
-Yeah.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.717
Oh, wow.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.519
They're certainly not
scared of us.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.957
<i> Usually we're in the woods</i>
<i> and we look like humans,</i>

10:59.025 --> 11:01.159
And the mountain lions
really don't want anything
to do with us.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.262
Here, we look like animals.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.830
<i> We're wearing hides.</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:08.199
<i> They look at us</i>
<i> just like they would a deer</i>

11:08.201 --> 11:11.036
<i> Or an elk,</i>
<i> and so we're actually prey.</i>

11:11.104 --> 11:13.605
We're one of the many things
that they can eat out here.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.273
[jermaine] I'll go
check the snares.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.641
Hey, good luck, buddy.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.144
-[wind blows]
-oh! Brutal.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.047
<i> There's a distinct</i>
<i> creepy feeling</i>

11:22.049 --> 11:24.015
<i> Any time that you feel</i>
<i> there's an animal around,</i>

11:24.017 --> 11:25.850
<i> But the thought of walking</i>

11:25.919 --> 11:28.253
To check the snares,

11:28.321 --> 11:30.055
<i> It's scaring</i>
<i> the hell out of me.</i>

11:30.156 --> 11:33.958
<i> But we need a food win.</i>
<i> We need it.</i>

11:43.003 --> 11:44.402
Nothing.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.004
<i> The traps are perfect.</i>

11:46.006 --> 11:47.138
<i> I mean,</i>
<i> if you look at these traps,</i>

11:47.240 --> 11:48.840
You'd think you bought them
at the store.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.842
But nobody wants to come in.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.446
That set-up is so perfect.
Just go in there, rabbit.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.716
See if I missed anything.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.452
This whole area's
a little creepy.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.322
Looks like there's a den.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.426
We know a mountain lion's
been around our place.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.037
I have my hatchet ready.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.406
[whispers] yeah, it's scary.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.711
I don't know
how smart this is.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.518
I'm just trying to scan,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.054
Make sure we're not
being looked at.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.958
It feels like
something's hunting me.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.000
It feels like
something's hunting me.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.105
So we out of here.
We're leaving.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.414
Other lion tracks.
See the paws?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.218
You can really feel
they're present. It's scary.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.426
<i> We do not run</i>
<i> if a mountain lion's around</i>

13:15.428 --> 13:17.529
Because then
you'd become prey.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.063
<i> So don't do that.</i>

13:19.065 --> 13:20.665
<i> Don't run.</i>

13:26.840 --> 13:29.440
That fish really
just revitalized me.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.744
Body and mind feel good
after that meal.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.646
My head's in it,
I'm ready for this,

13:34.714 --> 13:37.515
I'm excited about
the approaching extraction.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.151
-I feel like I'm still
riding high from that.
-Yeah.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.164
Yeah, between pus draining
into your stomach, and...

13:53.233 --> 13:55.433
Due to the lack
of brushing my teeth

13:55.502 --> 13:57.035
And being able to floss,

13:57.037 --> 13:59.637
I've had some food that's
caught under one of my teeth.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.406
<i> I think I need</i>
<i> to call the medic.</i>

14:02.409 --> 14:03.641
[josh] hey, ky.
What's going on?

14:03.743 --> 14:06.010
Well, I've got a bit of
an abscess in my jawline.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.046
It's been festering
for a few days now,

14:08.147 --> 14:10.415
But I can taste, like,
the pus in my mouth.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.518
And this jawline's
really tender to touch.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.921
I'm highly aware
that any abscess

14:16.923 --> 14:18.256
<i> Around the head area</i>

14:18.325 --> 14:20.925
<i> Is something that medics</i>
<i> will be concerned about.</i>

14:20.927 --> 14:22.327
All right, let's have
a look inside.

14:25.599 --> 14:28.233
Okay, yeah,
I do see some swelling.

14:28.334 --> 14:31.202
You can see kinda, like,
the fluid building up
down here.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.771
<i> Having an abscess in your ja</i>

14:33.773 --> 14:35.840
<i> There's a number of issues</i>
<i> that could come of it.</i>

14:35.942 --> 14:39.244
She could lose a portion
of the jawbone or the tooth.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.846
<i> Infection that close</i>
<i> to the brain is a problem.</i>

14:41.948 --> 14:43.448
<i> Infection can get</i>
<i> into the blood,</i>

14:43.549 --> 14:44.916
Which would be an issue.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.819
-We'll see if it gets
better or worse.
-Okay.

14:47.821 --> 14:50.054
So you can stay
in the fight, okay?

14:50.123 --> 14:53.157
If this abscess can go away,

14:53.259 --> 14:54.692
Then I'll feel happy

14:54.694 --> 14:56.527
<i> To continue</i>
<i> through the challenge.</i>

14:56.529 --> 15:00.131
<i> 'cause I'm like, what's</i>
<i> the problem, how can I fix I</i>

15:07.440 --> 15:11.643
[jake] so today,
I'm gonna be working
on a figure 4 deadfall.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.946
The big thing is finding
the right rock

15:14.948 --> 15:18.816
That will drop
and crush the animal.

15:18.818 --> 15:22.787
Definitely big enough
for a mouse and certainly
big enough for squirrels.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.023
I'm gonna bring
that back to camp.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.925
Keep my eye out
for some sticks.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.961
<i> The deadfall trap</i>
<i> is fairly straight forward,</i>

15:29.963 --> 15:31.829
<i> But the other side of it</i>
<i> is it's so fickle</i>

15:31.831 --> 15:36.401
Because you need
that trigger stick
to be just super sensitive.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.903
<i> So, just a mouse brushes</i>
<i> against it</i>

15:38.905 --> 15:40.405
<i> And the whole thing collapse</i>

15:40.407 --> 15:43.007
Here's the notch back here.

15:43.009 --> 15:46.511
See, I'm a little worried
'cause this edge
just seems a little

15:47.047 --> 15:48.112
Wonky doodle.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.848
Okay.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.717
Have you ever been
successful with one
of these?

15:52.719 --> 15:55.486
[waz] yeah, yeah.
In australia, we used
to catch a bunch

15:55.488 --> 15:57.255
Of different, like,
field mice.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.856
-[jake exclaims]
-[waz] it's all right,
it's all right.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.125
[jake] yeah. God.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.961
-Put some weight on it.
-Uh-huh.

16:03.596 --> 16:04.895
[waz] will you ever let go?

16:08.501 --> 16:11.135
[jake] this rock is just,
I mean, if I sneezed
right now,

16:11.237 --> 16:12.136
It'd probably go off.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.439
All right, nice work.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.546
[clears throat]

16:25.218 --> 16:26.617
[sara] I keep getting
short of breath.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.121
[breathing heavily]

16:38.331 --> 16:40.431
I just don't understand
why I'm getting short
of breath.

16:43.803 --> 16:44.802
Oh.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.604
Okay.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.539
[sighs]

16:49.909 --> 16:52.043
This is sara for the medic.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.346
I'm getting short of breath
and I'm not sure why.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.949
Could you just come down
and check on me for a second?

16:59.252 --> 17:00.318
Thank you.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.559
[katrina] hey, sara.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.428
-[sara] hey.
-What's going on?

17:10.430 --> 17:11.462
[sara speaking]

17:13.800 --> 17:14.699
[katrina] okay.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.401
Let me take
some vitals on you.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.435
I wanna listen
to your lung sounds.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.038
I wanna check your pulse oxi.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.106
-How much oxygen
you have, okay?
-Okay.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.412
-[katrina] having any, like,
chest tightness or...
-No.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.380
[katrina] and what
were you doing

17:29.382 --> 17:30.548
When you started
feeling short of breath?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.417
-Just walking around.
-Walking?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.252
We are
at a very high elevation.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.820
<i> And when people</i>
<i> aren't used to this,</i>

17:35.822 --> 17:38.122
<i> Uh, even a little bit</i>
<i> of exertion</i>

17:38.124 --> 17:40.858
<i> Can really, really do</i>
<i> a lot on the body.</i>

17:40.927 --> 17:41.926
Deep breath for me.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.063
Good. Out.

17:45.065 --> 17:48.800
<i> Checking sara's vitals.</i>
<i> Her heartrate was</i>
<i> extremely elevated.</i>

17:48.802 --> 17:50.968
<i> Her oxygen saturation was lo</i>

17:51.037 --> 17:53.671
It's called high altitude
pulmonary edema.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.206
-Okay.
-And sometimes people
will get that

17:55.208 --> 17:59.210
When they're exerting
themselves in high altitude,
which we are.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.013
[narrator] <i> high altitude</i>
<i> can increase pressure</i>
<i> in the blood vessels.</i>

18:02.015 --> 18:05.349
<i> To the point that capillarie</i>
<i> leak fluid into the lungs,</i>

18:05.451 --> 18:08.519
<i> Which if left untreated,</i>
<i> could turn fatal.</i>

18:09.155 --> 18:10.521
I think you're feeling,

18:11.658 --> 18:13.124
You know, just a little
out of breath.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.427
But we just don't
want you to start
getting a fluid buildup,

18:16.429 --> 18:19.497
You know,
in your lungs from this.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.033
[sara] <i> I'm actually concerne</i>
<i> about the shortness of breat</i>

18:22.135 --> 18:25.303
I'm not from a place
that's higher in elevation.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.505
And I guess my body's
just now reacting to that.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.507
As soon as you feel
short of breath,

18:29.509 --> 18:31.442
Um, just go ahead
and kind of relax.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.044
Try to get your breath back.

18:33.046 --> 18:36.114
Just take a minute,
kind of sit down
and catch your breath, okay?

18:37.150 --> 18:39.250
[sara] <i> I didn't even</i>
<i> think about altitude.</i>

18:40.120 --> 18:41.152
At all.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.734
Sometimes I just question,

18:56.836 --> 18:58.536
I could be back in louisiana

18:58.605 --> 19:00.138
In 80 degree temps.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.039
Never wanna quit,

19:02.108 --> 19:04.809
But I think this challenge
definitely test me more

19:04.811 --> 19:07.445
Than any of them ever has.

19:07.547 --> 19:11.249
[trish] <i> even though we haven</i>
<i> eaten for energy, it's mind</i>
<i> over matter out here.</i>

19:11.317 --> 19:14.819
And my spirit's still good.
I'm not giving up.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.254
[jeremy] I'm gonna go there
and check my bait.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.429
<i> So what I've noticed</i>
<i> down here is that</i>

19:25.431 --> 19:27.031
<i> As you walk up down the cree</i>

19:27.033 --> 19:28.933
<i> You'll see the trout,</i>
<i> they'll dart in</i>

19:29.035 --> 19:31.502
<i> 'cause they see</i>
<i> your shadow or they see you</i>

19:31.504 --> 19:33.037
<i> And they get scared</i>
<i> and they run off.</i>

19:33.806 --> 19:35.173
<i> So what we're gonna do is</i>

19:35.175 --> 19:38.009
Put our poles in right here
and let the poles do
the fishing

19:38.611 --> 19:39.810
While we ease back.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.746
You move too much,
it runs them off.

19:41.847 --> 19:42.613
I know.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.458
[jeremy] I get lightheaded.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.611
A trout.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.423
-A trout.
-[trish] no. [gasps]

20:25.425 --> 20:28.659
Yay! You got one! Oh, my god.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.062
Yay, first fish.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.431
-[jeremy] that's a win
in my books.
-Look at all the colors on it.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.334
[jeremy] finally,
I caught something.

20:36.435 --> 20:37.935
-[trish] yay.
-[jeremy laughs]

20:38.037 --> 20:41.405
Catching this fish is amazing.

20:41.407 --> 20:46.110
We're finally figuring out
the curve to this montana
winter...

20:48.381 --> 20:49.747
He's gotta get rinsed off.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.083
<i> ...And slowly succeeding.</i>

20:52.085 --> 20:53.317
[jeremy] we can
check our lines.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.253
-Look, look,
I'm getting another hit.
-Come on.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.723
Yeah, he's on, he's on.
You got fish on.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.725
-Oh, my god.
-[bleep]

21:00.727 --> 21:02.260
[both exclaiming]

21:03.463 --> 21:04.595
[laughing]

21:04.597 --> 21:07.265
[trish] that's even bigger.

21:07.333 --> 21:11.102
[jeremy] <i> oh, that feels good</i>
<i> we got two trout.</i>

21:11.104 --> 21:13.070
That means I'm getting food
in my belly.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.906
I know it looks small,

21:15.908 --> 21:18.042
But after 10 days,
if you haven't eaten,

21:18.044 --> 21:21.512
This is like the biggest
fish ever.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.548
[both laugh]

21:33.626 --> 21:36.260
[wes] sarah,
am I gonna be able to sink
that fish basket here

21:36.362 --> 21:38.262
Before the sun goes down?

21:38.364 --> 21:39.964
-I just gotta focus on this.
-All right.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.700
<i> Frustrated with sarah.</i>

21:42.702 --> 21:44.201
<i> She's making a fish basket,</i>

21:44.203 --> 21:47.605
Which can reasonably
take two days,

21:47.607 --> 21:50.207
<i> But this is going</i>
<i> on day five now.</i>

21:50.209 --> 21:53.210
<i> I need for this damn thing</i>
<i> to be in the water.</i>

21:57.617 --> 22:00.017
[sarah] the fish trap
is finally done.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.519
[wes] oh, sweet.

22:01.521 --> 22:05.122
I'm stocked about this.
This has been a massive
labor of love.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.958
So you can see, big old cone.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.261
One way in,
hopefully no way out.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.729
Thing of beauty.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.030
Sarah, can we set that?

22:13.032 --> 22:15.700
-[sarah] yeah.
-[jermaine] good luck.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.302
-May the crawfish gods
be with you.
-Something's gonna be with us.

22:18.304 --> 22:19.837
This is gonna work out.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.939
<i> Whoo, it's been</i>
<i> a long time coming.</i>

22:21.941 --> 22:25.843
<i> And I'm so happy</i>
<i> that she got</i>
<i> that fish trap done.</i>

22:25.912 --> 22:28.913
-Okay, so the deepest spot
is right there.
-[sarah] yep.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.815
[wes] problem is
is that the water's rolling.

22:31.818 --> 22:32.883
And I'm gonna have to put

22:33.886 --> 22:36.120
-A pretty substantial
rock on it.
-Yeah.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.189
-[wes] 'cause you know
I'm going in, right?
-Yep.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.925
-There's no way I can't go in.
-Yeah.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.227
[wes] <i> the icy creek,</i>
<i> it's freezing.</i>

22:43.229 --> 22:46.597
The only reason
it's not frozen is
because it's moving.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.399
[bleep] this is gonna be cold.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.000
[sarah] ah, I do not envy you.

22:52.438 --> 22:53.504
[wes groans]

22:55.508 --> 22:57.007
[wes exclaims]

22:57.009 --> 22:58.409
-[sarah] you good?
-[wes groans]

23:00.012 --> 23:02.513
[wes] <i> your toes</i>
<i> instantly go numb</i>

23:02.515 --> 23:06.450
<i> And then 30 seconds later,</i>
<i> they're hurting a lot.</i>

23:07.186 --> 23:09.053
<i> It's really, really awful.</i>

23:19.031 --> 23:21.132
-Ooh, boy.
-Hey, now.

23:21.701 --> 23:22.700
Hey, now.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.035
Okay.

23:25.137 --> 23:28.239
I mean, that looks
good right there.

23:28.340 --> 23:31.208
Sarah, I know I was
bitching and moaning
at you all day,

23:31.210 --> 23:33.110
But that is
an outstanding piece of work.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.579
-Thanks, man.
-Good job.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.680
<i> Really good job.</i>

23:47.460 --> 23:48.826
[sara] all right,
I'll start handing you stuff.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.130
Hold on, I can't...
I'm trying to catch my breath.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.698
It's weird.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.700
<i> So a little earlier today..</i>

23:56.702 --> 23:58.235
[sighs] okay.

23:58.237 --> 24:01.305
...Um, I was walking
and I just got short of breath
for all of a sudden.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.040
I have no idea why.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.810
Then it happened again
and it happened again.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.512
The medic told me
the reason I'm short
of breath

24:08.514 --> 24:11.515
Is because, basically,
we're in montana
and it's cold,

24:11.517 --> 24:13.717
-But elevation.
-[jake] well, that make sense.

24:13.719 --> 24:14.952
[sara] yeah,
it does, doesn't it?

24:15.054 --> 24:17.288
[jake] <i> sara is struggling</i>
<i> with something.</i>

24:17.290 --> 24:20.024
It's getting to the point
where I get, you know,
a little concerned.

24:20.026 --> 24:24.462
I mean, I really want
my whole group to be
feeling healthy.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.230
<i> And I'm starting</i>
<i> to question that.</i>

24:27.433 --> 24:31.202
So I am checking
our deadfall trap,

24:31.204 --> 24:34.705
Disappointed that
it hasn't been triggered,

24:34.707 --> 24:38.609
Is clearly has had something
munching on the trigger stick.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.345
Eh, it just...

24:41.447 --> 24:43.314
I think if a rabbit
was to do that,

24:43.316 --> 24:44.715
It probably would have
gone off,

24:44.717 --> 24:46.550
But there's no way a mouse
or something like that's

24:46.652 --> 24:48.819
Gonna set off that trigger.
It's just not...

24:48.821 --> 24:52.423
Um, not sensitive enough.
It needs to be more sensitive,
like me.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.426
Hey, buddy, you need
a hand up here?

24:55.428 --> 24:56.660
[jake] I would love a hand.

25:03.236 --> 25:04.702
If this doesn't
get that mouse,

25:04.704 --> 25:05.836
Nothing's going to.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.840
[waz speaking]

25:09.909 --> 25:11.308
[jake speaking]

25:11.310 --> 25:12.743
[waz speaking]

25:12.845 --> 25:17.314
-[jake speaking]
-[waz laughing]

25:23.556 --> 25:26.056
[trish] <i> that's</i>
<i> a gorgeous trout.</i>

25:26.058 --> 25:27.525
[jeremy] it's something
to eat, trish.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.859
[trish] yep, finally.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.629
[jeremy] look at that smile!

25:31.631 --> 25:34.064
-[exclaims]
-smiles for dinner.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.700
Midnight moose lodge
has had a win.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.068
[trish] mmm-hmm.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.938
[jeremy] I can't wait
to just feel protein
in my stomach.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.940
-[trish] how beautiful
they look.
-[jeremy] mmm, mmm, mmm.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.242
-Let's try.
-Give it a try?

25:45.311 --> 25:46.610
Which one you want
to go with first?

25:46.612 --> 25:47.711
Let's do the little guy.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.013
Little guy?

25:53.052 --> 25:54.652
I ain't never ate trout.

25:54.753 --> 25:57.054
So here I am
in montana eating trout
for the first time.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.924
God, that trout's good.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.026
<i> Just having something</i>
<i> in your stomach</i>

26:02.028 --> 26:04.261
<i> And knowing that</i>
<i> you're getting some source</i>
<i> of protein</i>

26:04.363 --> 26:05.930
Is definitely a morale boost.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.499
-You're on a streak.
-We are.

26:08.501 --> 26:10.801
[trish] <i> first trout out her</i>
<i> is pretty good,</i>

26:10.803 --> 26:13.237
And I have my partner
to thank for that.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.105
Gonna be my first eyeball.

26:18.644 --> 26:20.043
Gary, you better be
proud of me.

26:34.126 --> 26:37.127
It's amazing,
but I've grown quite fond
of these little ants.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.862
They're very tasty.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.531
<i> That could also be</i>
<i> 'cause I'm starving.</i>

26:42.935 --> 26:44.535
So the hunger has set in,

26:44.637 --> 26:46.403
And I'm getting
a little light-headed.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.939
<i> I call it a spinny day.</i>

26:56.449 --> 27:00.784
<i> There's always gonna be</i>
<i> those really dark times</i>

27:00.786 --> 27:03.153
<i> Where, you know,</i>
<i> you might feel defeated,</i>

27:04.023 --> 27:05.122
<i> Beaten, hungry...</i>

27:06.225 --> 27:07.257
<i> ...Spinny.</i>

27:07.359 --> 27:10.561
<i> The optimism comes</i>
<i> from knowing,</i>

27:10.663 --> 27:11.862
<i> You know, we came up</i>
<i> with plans.</i>

27:12.531 --> 27:13.831
<i> The plans are solid.</i>

27:13.833 --> 27:15.599
<i> We need some cooperation</i>
<i> from mother nature.</i>

27:30.149 --> 27:31.215
We have a rabbit.

27:31.851 --> 27:32.916
This is awesome.

27:34.720 --> 27:35.719
Oh, yeah.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.560
<i> I'm feeling, like,</i>
<i> beyond elated.</i>

27:47.066 --> 27:48.532
Let's surprise
the other people.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.237
Wes, it's set.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.439
Wanna set another one?

27:56.442 --> 27:58.809
-I'm running out of gas.
-[wes] all right.

27:58.811 --> 28:01.111
Yo, [bleep] that [bleep]!
We have the damn...

28:01.113 --> 28:03.714

-[wes] trapper jackson!

28:05.818 --> 28:07.251
Trapper jackson!

28:07.319 --> 28:08.419
Oh, my god.

28:08.421 --> 28:09.553
[wes] no, you didn't.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.523
[sarah] give me that.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.725

28:23.803 --> 28:25.602
Put that thing down,
get your knife,

28:25.604 --> 28:27.104
-Skin this thing...
-[sarah] you got it.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.206
-Give me that.
-[wes] oh!

28:29.208 --> 28:30.741
[jermaine] ...Start the fire.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.443
Get out!

28:32.511 --> 28:33.811
You're feeling good.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.446
-Oh, my gosh.
-[jermaine] we're about to
feel good.

28:36.949 --> 28:40.017
Okay, kiss it later.
Clean that thing, baby...

28:40.019 --> 28:41.919
-[sarah] you got it.
-...'cause we are hungry.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.821
I'm feeling beyond elated.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.223
You've been working at that
for damn ten days.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.524
Oh, look how beautiful.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.827
-[exclaiming]
-it's still warm.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.161
[jermaine] <i> with the prize</i>

28:51.230 --> 28:52.229
<i> I'm feeling accomplished.</i>

28:52.231 --> 28:53.931
I'm feeling like
the black cowboy.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.933
Let's get cooking,
let's start a fire.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.335
Get that war paint going.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.204
-[sarah] t for trapper.

for the team
that we get to eat

29:03.209 --> 29:04.608
<i> But for jermaine.</i>

29:04.610 --> 29:06.043
[jermaine] let's get
this party started.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.644
Thank you.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.747
[wes] <i> after eating</i>
<i> ants and rosehips,</i>

29:09.848 --> 29:12.349
<i> I mean, this is exactly</i>
<i> what we need.</i>

29:12.418 --> 29:13.550
And my body knows it.

29:13.619 --> 29:16.553
[jermaine] we're searing
to keep the moisture in.

29:16.655 --> 29:20.124
A little wild sage will give
a nice floral aroma
to the rabbit.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.458
[wes] we got
some good stuff coming.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.827
[jermaine] it's like
a rabbit bacon.

29:23.829 --> 29:26.230
[sarah] <i> could not be</i>
<i> more thankful for this</i>
<i> amazing feast.</i>

29:26.966 --> 29:28.065
<i> What a relief.</i>

29:29.301 --> 29:31.702
-[jermaine] voila!
-Ooh, look at that.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.644
[jermaine] <i> literally</i>
<i> after the first bite,</i>

29:40.713 --> 29:43.614
<i> You can feel your body</i>
<i> start to re-energize.</i>

29:49.555 --> 29:50.721
[sarah] oh, yeah.

29:50.723 --> 29:53.457
<i> This first taste of rabbit</i>
<i> is just phenomenal.</i>

29:53.526 --> 29:55.058
I eat a lot of rabbit
back home,

29:55.127 --> 29:56.660
But for whatever reason,

29:56.729 --> 29:59.429
<i> This rabbit tastes better</i>
<i> than any that I've had befor</i>

29:59.431 --> 30:01.598
Mmm, that's delicious.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.400
[jermaine] oh, we're gonna
sleep good tonight.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.042
-[gabby] you heading that way?
-[ky] yeah.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.944
-[gabby] good luck.
-[ky] thanks.

30:13.946 --> 30:16.547
-[gabby] you have fun
chewing that birch bark.
-[ky scoffs]

30:16.615 --> 30:21.051
I've developed an abscess
in my tooth and jawbone.

30:21.153 --> 30:25.255
<i> I'd hate to tap</i>
<i> due to something as simple</i>
<i> as an infection.</i>

30:25.324 --> 30:28.859
Birch bark, the inner bark,
if you chew on it,

30:28.928 --> 30:32.262
It can help fight
infections like this.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.064
So this is a birch.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.933
I'm just gonna cut off
a bit of the outer bark

30:35.935 --> 30:38.101
And see if I can find
some of the cambium layer

30:38.103 --> 30:40.204
<i> To, like, have a bit</i>
<i> of a chew on.</i>

30:40.206 --> 30:42.306
[narrator] <i> birch contains</i>
<i> methyl salicylate</i>

30:42.308 --> 30:43.941
<i> Or wintergreen oil,</i>

30:43.943 --> 30:46.410
<i> Which can help reduce pain</i>
<i> and inflammation.</i>

30:47.413 --> 30:48.745
Should be good.

30:48.814 --> 30:50.113
Let's see if it helps.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.050
<i> This tastes really bad</i>

30:53.752 --> 30:55.819
<i> But almost medicinal.</i>

30:55.821 --> 30:58.222
<i> I have faith in it</i>
<i> helping out the abscess.</i>

31:01.827 --> 31:03.794
[gabby] <i> so with ky</i>
<i> not feeling very well,</i>

31:03.796 --> 31:05.062
<i> I'm gonna pick up the slack</i>

31:05.064 --> 31:07.497
<i> Collecting firewood,</i>
<i> boiling water.</i>

31:07.499 --> 31:09.032
I don't have any doubts
for ky and I,

31:09.034 --> 31:11.335
But, um, we just have to
keep our eyes on the prize

31:11.436 --> 31:12.936
<i> Really to get through</i>
<i> this challenge.</i>

31:28.821 --> 31:30.854
[sara] <i> the wind, I mean,</i>

a long night.

-[jake] yeah.

31:56.615 --> 31:57.447
[sara] absolutely not.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.855
[coughs] oh, my god.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.602
5:00 this morning,
I just wanted to go home.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.504

at like 15, 20.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.428
<i> It just cuts you</i>
<i> to your core out here.</i>

32:49.501 --> 32:50.834
[jake] <i> sara has been</i>
<i> going through it.</i>

32:50.836 --> 32:54.037
I mean, the challenge
is physically
and mentally taxing.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.940
<i> I can't fault her for that.</i>

33:01.947 --> 33:03.847
[crying]

33:09.822 --> 33:11.521
I don't know
what is wrong with me.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.826
My emotions
are all over the place...

33:19.298 --> 33:20.731
...And I don't know why.

33:22.935 --> 33:25.602
<i> My body hates the cold</i>
<i> so much,</i>

33:25.604 --> 33:28.638
<i> And it's reacting</i>
<i> to the elevation.</i>

34:12.518 --> 34:14.117
Hey, now!

34:14.119 --> 34:16.853
[narrator] <i> ...And jermaine'</i>
<i> determination finally</i>
<i> paid off.</i>

34:16.955 --> 34:18.555
[jermaine speaking]

34:18.624 --> 34:20.724
Mmm, that's delicious.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.561
[narrator] <i> their team fsr</i>
<i> rises for 55 to 71%.</i>

34:25.998 --> 34:27.531
[jeremy] <i> my stomach's</i>
<i> growling.</i>

34:27.533 --> 34:28.698
[narrator] <i> desperate</i>
<i> for food...</i>

34:28.700 --> 34:30.801
-Heck yeah.
-[trish] that's
a big old worm.

34:30.803 --> 34:33.403
[narrator] <i> ...Jeremy and tri</i>
<i> were taken to the edge.</i>

34:33.405 --> 34:36.206
I'm sitting here thinking,
you know, we're gonna go
through the whole challenge

34:36.809 --> 34:38.208
<i> Not eating anything.</i>

34:38.210 --> 34:40.811
[narrator] <i> but a new strateg</i>
<i> led to their first food win.</i>

34:40.813 --> 34:42.813
-Trish!
-Look at that little tongue.

34:45.951 --> 34:47.517
[narrator] <i> ...Causing</i>
<i> their fsr to jump</i>

34:47.519 --> 34:50.487
<i> From 19 to 48%.</i>

34:50.489 --> 34:52.322
-[gasps] there's something
on there.
-[gabby] got it?

34:52.324 --> 34:53.857
[narrator] <i> after losing</i>
<i> their partner...</i>

34:53.925 --> 34:56.126
[ky] <i> wow, we got food</i>
<i> for tonight!</i>

34:56.128 --> 34:58.595
[narrator] <i> ...Ky and gabby</i>
<i> scored another big win...</i>

34:58.597 --> 34:59.863
You did good, ky.

34:59.965 --> 35:01.698
-[laughing]
-you did real good.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.700
[narrator] <i> ...But also</i>
<i> suffered a setback.</i>

35:03.702 --> 35:06.670
Got a bit of an abscess
in my jawline.

35:06.672 --> 35:10.340
[narrator] <i> their fsr</i>
<i> holds at 59%.</i>

35:10.409 --> 35:12.209
-[waz] put some weight on it?
<i> -</i>  [jake] uh-huh.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.112
[narrator] <i> jake, waz,</i>
<i> and sara implemented</i>
<i> several strategies</i>

35:15.114 --> 35:16.913
<i> To procure their next meal..</i>

35:16.915 --> 35:19.816
This is the deepest area
I can find.

35:19.818 --> 35:22.319
[narrator]
<i> ...But the punishing element</i>
<i> took a toll on sara...</i>

35:22.321 --> 35:23.954
I'm so [bleep] cold.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.822
Deep breath for me.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.924
Her heart rate
was extremely elevated.

35:27.926 --> 35:33.263
[narrator] <i> ...Leading to</i>
<i> a drop in the team's fsr</i>
<i> from 78 to 62%.</i>

35:33.332 --> 35:35.699
My emotions
are all over the place.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.934
[narrator] <i> unless sara</i>
<i> can rebound quickly,</i>

35:37.936 --> 35:39.536
<i> Her challenge is at risk.</i>

35:48.413 --> 35:50.013
[waz] are you okay?

35:50.015 --> 35:52.549
I don't really know
what's wrong with me,
I'm just emotional.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.584
[jake] we're in a really
[bleep] situation.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.620
It's understandable
to be emotional.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.492
It's okay.
It's a brutal challenge.

36:02.494 --> 36:06.196
[sara] <i> this challenge</i>
<i> feels like being locked</i>
<i> in a cooler</i>

36:06.198 --> 36:11.701
And then having those
giant barn fans blowing on you
at all times.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.204
You just have to know
that waz and I are here 100%.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.039
No, I know, you guys
are excellent,

36:16.141 --> 36:17.240
Absolutely excellent.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.809
I have no idea
what the [bleep]
is wrong with me.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.612
[jake] <i> I hope that sara's</i>
<i> able to get over this hump</i>

36:22.614 --> 36:24.447
Because I think she's
a great person,

36:24.549 --> 36:28.118
And I think she's very capable
of doing everything out here.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.719
[waz] being emotional's okay.
Everyone's emotional.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.022
I never cry. That's the thing.

36:32.024 --> 36:34.124
-[waz] I cry all the time.
-I don't.

36:34.126 --> 36:36.026
-I don't like it.
-[waz] I probably cry more
than everyone in this room,

36:36.028 --> 36:37.227
Three or four times a week,

36:37.229 --> 36:38.628
In front of my kids,
everything.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.963
I don't mind
that vulnerability.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.464
It's a good thing. It's human.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.200
It allows you to process
the emotions

36:43.202 --> 36:44.634
That you're feeling
and going through,
which is...

36:45.437 --> 36:46.503
Which is amazing.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.938
But I came
into this challenge,

36:48.039 --> 36:50.106
And I said to myself,
"I don't care who I'm with,

36:50.108 --> 36:51.441
I want everyone to make it."

36:51.543 --> 36:53.310
I want everyone
to do everything
they want to achieve

36:53.312 --> 36:55.412
And, like, get everything
out of it they can.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.414
<i> It's a big part</i>
<i> of my personality</i>
<i> and character</i>

36:57.416 --> 36:58.815
<i> Is helping the people</i>
<i> around me.</i>

36:58.817 --> 37:00.283
<i> It's something I always</i>
<i> try and teach my kids.</i>

37:00.285 --> 37:02.519
Like, if you have
someone around you
that needs help

37:02.521 --> 37:04.087
And your in the position
to help them,

37:04.089 --> 37:06.156
Then that's your duty
and obligation to do that.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.958
<i> She came into this</i>
<i> not confident,</i>

37:08.026 --> 37:10.227
And I want to watch her
walk out of here

37:10.229 --> 37:12.295
With all the confidence
in the world.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.965
[sara] I'm not a quitter.
[bleep], this is hard.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.033
[jake] yeah, no it is.

37:17.035 --> 37:19.903
[waz] definitely feel
the effects of the altitude

37:19.905 --> 37:22.138
And the cold air and...

37:22.240 --> 37:24.207
[sara] I know it's definitely
gotten to me,

37:24.209 --> 37:26.343
Just shorter
of breath, quicker.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.121
[katrina] all right,
good morning, guys.

37:38.123 --> 37:39.222
-Hello.
-Hey.

37:39.224 --> 37:41.157
[katrina] I'm here to do
your vitals, all right?

37:41.193 --> 37:42.626
-[waz] okay.
-[katrina] so let's
pull you guys out,

37:42.628 --> 37:44.761
Check your vitals,
make sure everything's
going all right.

37:44.796 --> 37:45.929
Okay, who's first?

37:45.931 --> 37:47.230
[katrina] uh, sara, go ahead
and come on out.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.033
Sara, over the past few days,

37:50.135 --> 37:53.103
Uh, has been exhibiting
some symptoms that
I'm really worried about.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.505
Her oxygen saturation,
every time I check it,

37:55.507 --> 37:57.741
It's getting a little bit
lower and lower.

37:57.743 --> 38:00.110
<i> So today, I'm gonna</i>
<i> check her vitals</i>

38:00.112 --> 38:02.145
<i> And see if they've</i>
<i> improved at all.</i>

38:22.334 --> 38:23.433
[sara speaking]

38:24.936 --> 38:26.903
[katrina] so at this point,

38:26.905 --> 38:30.006
[clears throat]
you are running
a low-grade fever, okay?

38:30.008 --> 38:32.642
With the trouble,
you know, the complaints
you've had as far as, like,

38:32.711 --> 38:34.110
Trouble breathing, um,

38:34.112 --> 38:35.612
-You've had a cough.
-You're not tapping me.

38:36.748 --> 38:39.316
[katrina] your oxygen
saturation is at 92,

38:39.318 --> 38:41.017
And it's concerning
because at a certain point,

38:41.019 --> 38:43.753
That becomes
very unhealthy, all right?

38:43.822 --> 38:46.222
You know, you also
should not be having
a fever, right?

38:46.224 --> 38:47.924
You're in a very cold
environment.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.260
Your fever's at 101.4.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.829
So at this point,
I am gonna have to
medically tap you...

38:52.831 --> 38:54.064
[cries]

38:54.066 --> 38:56.399
...And we're gonna get you
to a lower elevation, okay,

38:56.401 --> 38:57.801
And get you
some supplemental oxygen.

38:57.803 --> 38:59.703
[sara] three days, man.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.438
[katrina] the elevation
affects everybody differently.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.808
Please, I'm...

39:04.810 --> 39:06.843
[katrina] there's acute
mountain sickness

39:06.912 --> 39:09.346
Or, um, high-elevation
pulmonary edema,

39:09.414 --> 39:11.214
Which I'm really
concerned about

39:11.216 --> 39:13.450
For your particular
vitals, okay?

39:13.551 --> 39:14.951
[sara] I don't believe this.

39:16.221 --> 39:18.488
<i> All the stuff the medic</i>
<i> was saying to me,</i>

39:18.490 --> 39:19.956
<i> It went in one ear</i>
<i> and out the other.</i>

39:20.058 --> 39:22.525
I didn't listen to it
because I want to be out here,

39:22.527 --> 39:24.828
And that's how I feel.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.363
Are you, like, serious?
Are you...

39:28.333 --> 39:30.433
We don't have
the right equipment up here

39:30.502 --> 39:32.902
To be able to look inside
and see if there's actually

39:32.904 --> 39:34.237
Something going on
with your lung.

39:34.339 --> 39:36.406
I do not feel comfortable
letting you continue, okay?

39:37.743 --> 39:39.442
Sara, this isn't
you failing, babe.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.044
This really isn't.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.445
You've done so well
on this challenge.

39:42.514 --> 39:43.813
You've pushed yourself
so hard.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.515
This is not you failing,
this is...

39:45.517 --> 39:47.150
-It's not fair, man.
-[waz] this is them
making sure

39:47.219 --> 39:49.619
Your kids have a mother
in a week or two weeks.

39:49.621 --> 39:50.954
[ethan] we want to
get you out of here,

39:50.956 --> 39:52.088
Put you on oxygen.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.656
If you want to say goodbye
to the guys.

39:53.725 --> 39:54.958
Yeah, sure.

39:55.927 --> 39:56.960
Bye, guys.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.528
You did well.
I'm proud of you.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.130
-[crying] it's not fair.
-You did good.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.799
You did good. Just be
proud of yourself, all right?

40:02.801 --> 40:04.333
[sara] bye, jake.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.804
[waz] your health
is the most important thing
out of anything, you know.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.409
<i> That's tough to watch.</i>

40:12.411 --> 40:13.943
I mean, they're making
the right call

40:13.945 --> 40:15.345
If she's got
that kind of fever.

40:15.447 --> 40:16.513
[waz] yeah.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.447
You can have
a seat right here.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.949
We'll get you
some oxygen right now.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.585
[katrina] just try to take
some good, good deep breaths
for me, all right?

40:22.587 --> 40:24.153
[waz] <i> but the kids</i>
<i> need a mother, like...</i>

40:24.155 --> 40:25.822
-[jake] well that's the...
-If it's a health thing,
it's a health thing.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.391
Yeah, I was so pissed
when I was medically tapped.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.827
But, you know,
a couple weeks later,

40:30.829 --> 40:32.962
It was like,
had they not done that,
I would have died.

40:33.632 --> 40:34.631
[ethan] I'm sorry.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.202
[sara] I don't think
I should be tapped.

40:39.204 --> 40:40.904
I mean, this meant
everything to me.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.408
<i> I mean, I was gonna be</i>
<i> so proud of myself</i>

40:45.410 --> 40:48.912
<i> For defeating something</i>
<i> that I absolutely</i>
<i> cannot stand,</i>

40:48.914 --> 40:50.313
Which is cold weather.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.648
And I mean, I had
three days left.

40:54.019 --> 40:57.120
<i> I came into this challenge</i>
<i> not knowing that</i>
<i> I could do an hour.</i>

40:57.122 --> 40:58.521
<i> I did 11 days.</i>

40:58.523 --> 40:59.755
But gosh dammit,

40:59.757 --> 41:03.126
<i> I want that 14 so bad</i>
<i> 'cause I know I can now.</i>

41:03.128 --> 41:06.362
<i> I do these challenges</i>
<i> to push myself</i>

41:06.464 --> 41:10.200
And to show that
I am tougher than I look.

41:10.202 --> 41:12.936
I completely pushed myself
out of my comfort zone,

41:12.938 --> 41:14.704
And I would do it
in a heartbeat again.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.940
<i> Montana did not defeat me.</i>

41:17.008 --> 41:18.942
I guess my body
has defeated me.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.545
[narrator] <i> sara was given</i>
<i> supplemental oxygen</i>

41:22.614 --> 41:25.348
<i> And taken to a lower elevati</i>
<i> for treatment,</i>

41:25.417 --> 41:27.250
<i> Where she was able</i>
<i> to safely recover</i>

41:27.319 --> 41:28.451
<i> Before returning home.</i>
