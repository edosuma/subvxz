WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:04.700
- You don't have papers.

00:05.222 --> 00:07.137
After everything over
these years,

00:07.181 --> 00:09.487
I'm not worried about
leaving her home alone.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.880
- Stop.
- Come on!

00:10.923 --> 00:12.142
[grunts]

00:12.186 --> 00:13.230
- How's she doing?

00:13.274 --> 00:15.015
- Somewhere between
didn't happen

00:15.058 --> 00:16.668
and can't stop thinking
about it.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.280
[rhythmic music]

00:21.630 --> 00:23.110
[indistinct chatter]

00:25.112 --> 00:28.680
- I get to her office
with a bouquet of flowers.

00:28.724 --> 00:32.075
Nervous. Hoping she'll say yes
to coffee.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.338
But she thinks
I'm the delivery guy.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.601
- She didn't remember you?
[chuckles]

00:36.949 --> 00:40.605
- So I pretended
to be the delivery guy
and I got out of there.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.739
She gave me a good tip though.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.306
- Okay.
[chuckles]

00:45.349 --> 00:47.438
- How is Rania settling in?

00:48.222 --> 00:53.183
- She's great, although
she'd rather be teaching
than serving coffee.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.360
Amira loves that she's here.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.580
I guess I'm a better father
than I am a mother.

00:58.623 --> 01:01.887
- Who said you were any good
at either?

01:01.931 --> 01:03.715
[scoffs]

01:05.761 --> 01:08.720
- Tell me again Khaled. You
tried for asylum two years ago.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.680
Why does your new lawyer think
it will be any different today?

01:11.723 --> 01:15.075
- He does this for people
whose first claim was denied.

01:15.597 --> 01:18.730
He says even though I've been
living here without papers,

01:18.774 --> 01:22.082
he can make the case
it's not safe for me in Libya.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.258
There's too much fighting
and violence.

01:24.301 --> 01:27.522
- And he knows this official in
the office in Ottawa?

01:27.565 --> 01:28.566
He's confident?

01:28.610 --> 01:31.221
- That's why my interview
is there.

01:31.265 --> 01:34.920
What about you, Bashir? Do you
love having Rania here too?

01:34.964 --> 01:37.619
- I do.
Of course I do.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.581
[car door slams]

01:47.542 --> 01:50.588
They don't tell you on the spot
if your appeal is successful?

01:50.632 --> 01:53.330
- No, but Mr. Kline says
I can work legally

01:53.374 --> 01:55.115
while it's being processed.

01:55.724 --> 01:58.161
[thunder rumbling]
- And if it isn't successful?

01:58.640 --> 02:00.946
- Thank you, brother.
For the money,

02:00.990 --> 02:03.253
and for getting me here.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.305
[gentle music]

02:32.021 --> 02:34.197
- Mr. Gupta?
I'm Dr. Hamed.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.460
- Gupta. Like loop.

02:36.504 --> 02:39.028
- Mr. Gupta, I hear you have
a puncture wound.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.204
- You make it sound like
I was stabbed.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.728
Not so exciting as that
Dr. Ahmed.

02:43.772 --> 02:44.903
- Hamed.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.342
- I turned into an exposed nail.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.474
- How long ago did that happen?

02:50.518 --> 02:53.521
I only ask because it
looks infected.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.001
- Three days ago.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.528
I dressed it myself,
but I guess not very well.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.530
- When you last get
a tetanus shot?

03:02.573 --> 03:05.054
- When I came from India,
four years ago.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.404
Where are you from
Dr. Hamed?

03:07.448 --> 03:09.841
- Syria.
Two and a half years ago.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.670
- And you are already a doctor?
Good for you.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.020
- Well, back home,
I was already a doctor.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.022
Here, I'm still a resident.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.850
- Still, so fast.

03:18.894 --> 03:21.679
- Right place
at the right time I suppose.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.900
I'm fortunate someone gave me
an opportunity.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.558
What do you do for work, sir?

03:30.601 --> 03:32.734
- I am trained as
an electrical engineer.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.257
Will you need to stitch?

03:35.084 --> 03:38.653
- Because of the infection,
I think we should leave it open.

03:38.696 --> 03:42.047
We should order some blood work
just in case,

03:42.091 --> 03:44.049
and get you started
on antibiotics.

03:44.093 --> 03:48.271
- My company needs a form saying
I'm fine to go back to work.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.317
You'll sign it?

03:51.274 --> 03:53.929
- Let's wait and see
what your labs say.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.412
[indistinct chatter on PA]

04:02.285 --> 04:03.634
- You break that, you buy it.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.897
Jake Cooper?
I'm Dr. Hunter.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.638
- Wow, you're young!

04:07.682 --> 04:11.033
I mean, this is my first
hospital rotation

04:11.076 --> 04:14.906
and I wasn't planning
on making a terrible
first impression?

04:14.950 --> 04:17.995
- Don't sweat it.
How's third-year med school
treating you?

04:18.040 --> 04:19.911
- Good. Good. Yeah.

04:19.954 --> 04:21.913
I'm glad to be getting a break
from exams though.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.567
- Hmm. So why pediatrics?

04:23.611 --> 04:26.135
- It wasn't my first choice.
My first choice was full,

04:26.178 --> 04:29.269
but I figured I should probably
just keep my options open.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.009
- Then I'll save you
the sales pitch.

04:31.053 --> 04:35.884
Except to say that like
any calling, it chooses you.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.323
- No missed appointments?
- No.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.110
- No fluctuations
in your rhythm.

04:45.154 --> 04:48.418
If this holds, we can push
your pacemaker another year,

04:48.462 --> 04:50.594
maybe two.
- That's great.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.988
- One more thing.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.556
Any interest in a part-time
resident practice?

04:55.599 --> 04:58.167
- Really?
- Emerg would come first.

04:58.646 --> 05:02.345
I could use a resident with
your experience in cardiology.

05:02.650 --> 05:06.349
I know your own cardiac history
isn't something you spend
a lot of time dwelling on,

05:06.393 --> 05:08.873
but these experiences
are formative.

05:09.178 --> 05:12.050
And who better than someone
who knows what it's like
to be a cardiac--

05:12.094 --> 05:13.574
- I don't think so.

05:14.618 --> 05:18.709
I mean, thank you. That's
a great offer, I just, um...

05:18.753 --> 05:22.322
I don't think it's
the right time to take on more.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.325
- You're busy. I figured.
No problem.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.459
- You've been my mechanic
for 20 years, Frank.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.156
First time you've come to me
for medical help.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.071
More pain, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:33.115 --> 05:36.684
- Yeah. Okay.
- I'm a fix-it-myself
type of guy, Jed.

05:37.032 --> 05:40.035
Is whatever this is gonna mean
more problems for me?

05:40.078 --> 05:43.473
- You mean like coming in
with an oil leak and needing
an engine rebuilt?

05:43.517 --> 05:46.302
No, it's just
a dislocated shoulder.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.390
- You're pawning me off.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.697
- Eh, an apprentice,
same as you.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.177
Claire starts a new role
soon and needs a--

05:52.221 --> 05:53.831
- Guinea pig?
[chuckling]

05:53.875 --> 05:55.529
- Trust me and just lie
back already.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.879
[indistinct chatter]

06:00.055 --> 06:01.535
- I got it.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.450
- Okay. So it's like
a handshake, you know,

06:03.493 --> 06:07.976
and you'll slowly
work it up to 90 degrees.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.500
[groaning in pain]

06:10.544 --> 06:13.373
- There's resistance.
- Well, there should be.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.376
Frank.
Frank, are you with us?

06:16.419 --> 06:18.247
- Um...
- Frank.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.640
- Huh.
- His pulse is strong.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.424
- Yeah, you just got to, um...

06:21.468 --> 06:23.034
just gotta hyper-extend it.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.384
[cracking]

06:24.427 --> 06:26.211
There we go. Okay.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.737
- It's alright, Frank,
just breathe.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.870
- Okay, well, I'm getting
an irregular heartbeat,

06:32.914 --> 06:35.264
and so, for a man your age,
we're gonna want to rule out

06:35.307 --> 06:36.700
anything like
cardiac arrhythmias,

06:36.744 --> 06:39.137
hypoglycemia or
blood pressure issues.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.792
- You said it was just
a shoulder, Jed.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.055
- The loss of consciousness
changes that.

06:44.099 --> 06:47.494
We'll keep you a little longer,
run some tests.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.021
Dr. Curtis.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.763
Was it necessary to steamroll
Claire like that?

06:57.199 --> 07:00.332
- I just... I wasn't sure if
she needed help and I thought...

07:00.376 --> 07:03.074
I wasn't sure if you--
- Let me set the record
straight.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.685
I'm not hands on,

07:04.728 --> 07:08.471
but if I need anyone stepping in
on a patient I'm overseeing,

07:08.515 --> 07:11.039
I will ask.
Any questions?

07:11.822 --> 07:13.476
- Which one of you is
Dr. Hunter?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.957
- That's me.
- You've been served.

07:19.961 --> 07:23.747
- Guess that's one way to
announce I'm getting a divorce.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.967
- Theo. I'm so sorry.

07:26.010 --> 07:30.058
- In other news,
has everyone met Jake Cooper?

07:39.850 --> 07:41.504
- Hey, Theo.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.943
- I knew it was coming.

07:46.509 --> 07:49.947
Didn't think it would be
in front of all my colleagues
but, uh...

07:49.991 --> 07:52.297
I still get to see
plenty of the girls.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.822
Even got myself an apartment.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.694
A divorced dad's apartment
in Sudbury.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.348
If you have to take that.

07:59.391 --> 08:02.525
- Yeah, sorry,
just one second. Hello?

08:09.837 --> 08:11.969
[Arnold]: I've got an urgent
walk-in in here!

08:12.013 --> 08:13.405
- What happened?

08:13.449 --> 08:15.364
- These two got out the back
of a car and they just--

08:15.407 --> 08:17.409
- My neighbour fell through
the glass doors of our building.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.934
We couldn't tell how bad it was
until we got him in the car.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.240
I'm scared if I move my hands
they'll pop out again.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.633
His insides.

08:23.981 --> 08:26.984
- Okay. Let's go.
I need help in here!

08:27.028 --> 08:29.509
Okay Alison, we've got you.
Claire will take over

08:29.552 --> 08:31.206
after I count to three.
- Standing by.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.383
- Alright. Let's give our good
samaritan a break, Dr. Leblanc.

08:34.426 --> 08:37.038
- On it. One, two, three.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.910
- Airway is patent! Pulse is
weak and rapid! Prepare for MTP!

08:40.955 --> 08:43.479
- Will he be okay?
- He has a chance, now,
thanks to you.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.741
We'll update you as soon
as we can.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.831
- Heart rate is 140,
BP is 90 over 50.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.833
Scratch that, 80 over 60
and losing blood fast!

08:49.877 --> 08:52.314
- Tell me what you're seeing!
- Penetrating hepatic trauma.

08:52.357 --> 08:55.752
Patient rolled through a glass
door. Narrow pulse pressure,

08:55.796 --> 08:58.320
hypotensive, tachycardic, and
hemodynamically unstable.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.323
- That is one exposed liver.
- Possible laceration?

09:01.366 --> 09:02.933
- Gonna have to retract,
to be sure.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.022
- I've only done that once.
- That never stopped you before.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.547
Janie, the retractors
for Dr. Leblanc.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.331
You'll need to find the bleed.

09:09.374 --> 09:12.943
You're going to gently suspend
the organ to look underneath.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.250
Arnold, one gram TXA.
- Yeah.

09:19.994 --> 09:23.563
And putting packed cells
through the level one now!

09:23.606 --> 09:24.868
- Talk to me, Mags.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.957
- The blood's pooling
underneath the liver.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.568
- Are you asking me
or telling me?

09:28.611 --> 09:30.831
- I'm telling. I can't see
where the blood is coming from!

09:30.874 --> 09:34.051
- Arnold, see if you can get
more light. Claire, give her
a hand to get a better look.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.619
Right in there.
- The hepatic artery is...

09:36.663 --> 09:38.969
inferior, anterior, and
to the right.

09:39.013 --> 09:41.711
- Mags?
- I've got the hepatoduodenal
ligament.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.409
- Pressure's dropping, guys!
- Possible tear in the artery.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.889
I'm gonna perform
the Pringle maneuver.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.718
- Yup.
- We need to clamp
the porta hepatis.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.590
- Satinsky clamp!

09:54.594 --> 09:56.900
Oh, I got it.
- Good, good. Right.

09:56.944 --> 10:00.817
Cover the wound with soaked
dressings, get him up to OR now.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.302
- I couldn't see where
the bleed was coming from.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.479
- I understand the way
your confidence is rattled.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.438
I know you took a couple of days
off, but if you need more time.

10:13.482 --> 10:16.833
- No, I'm fine, sir. I just want
things to go back to normal.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.184
- Our new family doctor thinks
it's an allergy.

10:20.228 --> 10:23.971
Put us on a food challenge,
but every time we...

10:24.014 --> 10:26.669
I mean, we rule something out
the vomiting comes back,

10:26.713 --> 10:28.628
and he threw up bile
this morning.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.717
- That does not sound fun,

10:30.760 --> 10:33.110
but why don't you open up
and let me take a look, okay.

10:33.154 --> 10:36.070
- No offense to the hard-working
doctors in the room,

10:36.113 --> 10:37.985
but our GP isn't doing enough.
You know?

10:38.028 --> 10:41.205
We need real results
from real tests, as soon
as you can get us in.

10:41.249 --> 10:45.819
A scope, MRI, blood work,
someone to take this seriously.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.473
- Well, any recurring fever
or headaches?

10:48.517 --> 10:49.692
- No.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.912
- Why don't you lay back for me.

10:52.608 --> 10:56.568
How about stress? 'Cause
that can really do a number
on your stomach.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.962
- We just moved from
Winnipeg.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.138
First year of high school
in a new city.

11:01.182 --> 11:04.446
But Dima here, he's kicking ass
and taking names.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.709
Gets straight A's,
he always has.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.538
He's been a real trooper
about all of this.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.671
We're gonna get
through this, pal.

11:12.193 --> 11:14.717
- Chronic gastritis?
- That's rare in teenagers.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.197
- Appendicitis?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.938
- There's no localized
abdominal pain.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.635
What'd you think about the dad?

11:19.679 --> 11:23.030
- I mean. Nice guy.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.989
He didn't exactly let
his son get a word in?

11:26.033 --> 11:27.948
- And exhaustion and
gastrointestinal symptoms

11:27.991 --> 11:29.427
can all stem from anxiety.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.430
- Well, if it's psychological,
would Dimitri know that?

11:32.474 --> 11:34.128
- I'm not ready to say.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.783
Even well-meaning parents
can have blind spots.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.306
Especially when their life's
in transition.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.569
These things can be delicate.
- I guess you'd know.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.136
[sighing]

11:42.179 --> 11:44.791
As a doctor,
not as a parent. I'd...

11:44.834 --> 11:46.488
I don't even know
if you have kids.

11:46.531 --> 11:49.099
- We'll check for an ulcer,
with a barium swallow,

11:49.143 --> 11:51.841
but that'll have to wait
until tomorrow.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.888
Hopefully, Dimitri will be ready
to open up by then.

11:55.584 --> 11:59.719
In the meantime, you get
to learn how to order GI tests.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.852
- The glass sliced an artery
under his liver,

12:02.896 --> 12:05.855
but we got to it in time
because you kept him alive.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.597
- I've lived down the hall
from him for years,

12:08.640 --> 12:10.773
but I don't even know Warren.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.862
- Well, thank you so much
for everything.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.516
- Are you saying
I should leave?

12:14.559 --> 12:18.041
- I mean, it's just, there's not
much else you can do for him.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.740
- I have his phone, I could...

12:20.783 --> 12:22.872
let his family know
what happened.

12:22.916 --> 12:26.789
- Our social worker can do that.
Unless you know them maybe?

12:27.442 --> 12:30.837
- It's just... I'm always
at work, first thing.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.753
Only today, I was late.
Trust me, I'm an accountant,

12:33.796 --> 12:35.232
I'm the last one to go down
this road,

12:35.276 --> 12:37.887
but it's like the Universe
put me there

12:37.931 --> 12:39.889
at that exact moment.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.892
And now, I've held his liver
in my hands.

12:42.936 --> 12:46.243
I need to see this through.

12:46.287 --> 12:49.072
- I heard you had a major liver
laceration in trauma?

12:49.116 --> 12:51.858
- Apparently, the universe
put me there just to fix it.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.555
[chuckles softly]

12:53.598 --> 12:55.252
- You don't believe in fate?

12:55.296 --> 12:58.516
- I mean, no, but the universe
doesn't reward

12:58.560 --> 12:59.996
or punish us
for who we are.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.998
- Right, that was
Dr. Novak's job

13:02.042 --> 13:03.783
and thankfully he's gone now?

13:03.826 --> 13:06.611
- No, it's now what I...
I don't know.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.962
[sirens blaring
in the distance]

13:11.703 --> 13:15.925
- Hello again, Mr. Gupta. So
your wound seems under control.

13:15.969 --> 13:19.668
We saw an elevated white blood
cell count in your labs.

13:19.711 --> 13:22.627
So I'll be giving you
a prescription for antibiotics,

13:22.671 --> 13:26.544
as well as instructions
for regular cleaning and
redressing.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.982
- Then I can leave?
- You can...

13:29.025 --> 13:33.813
- And the form? My employer
needs it for insurance purposes.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.685
- You said you were
an electrical engineer,

13:36.728 --> 13:40.167
but on the form it says that
you work on a construction site?

13:40.210 --> 13:43.170
- I said I was trained as one.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.782
Right now I work as
an electrician's apprentice.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.740
- Is this work physical
in nature?

13:48.784 --> 13:51.047
- I pull cables, lay wire.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.876
- If you're bending, lifting,
doing strenuous activity,

13:53.920 --> 13:55.486
it could aggravate your wound...

13:55.530 --> 13:58.011
- So you won't sign it?

13:58.838 --> 14:02.145
- I will, if you agree to rest
for 72 hours.

14:02.189 --> 14:05.279
- They'll replace me
if I take that long.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.194
You can help me, but you won't?

14:07.237 --> 14:09.283
- Sir, I'm trying to help you

14:09.326 --> 14:11.720
by doing what I can to keep
you from risking further injury.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.897
- Someone's forgotten
what it's like when he's not
at the right place

14:14.941 --> 14:16.943
at the right time.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.041
[line ringing]

14:29.869 --> 14:33.133
- What about you, Bashir? Do you
love having Rania here too?

14:33.176 --> 14:35.918
- I do. Of course, I do.

14:38.747 --> 14:42.011
I wish we got to stay
where we were.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.102
Live our lives from then.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.674
- If I'm more than five hours,
just go.

14:52.717 --> 14:56.025
- Go back to Toronto?
Without you?

14:56.373 --> 15:00.160
- I missed hearings
after my first asylum claim
was denied.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.944
[sighing]

15:01.988 --> 15:05.556
There's a detention order
against me. They may hold me.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.342
- What? For how long?

15:08.385 --> 15:10.692
- Mr. Kline doesn't think
it will happen

15:10.735 --> 15:12.563
and I said I would risk it.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.348
I gave him your number
just in case.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.958
- Khaled, you're telling me
this now?

15:16.002 --> 15:19.570
- I didn't want you to try
to talk me out of doing it.

15:20.702 --> 15:24.619
Bashir, I don't work,
unless it's under the table.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.448
I am tired of living like
a fugitive.

15:28.231 --> 15:31.365
Always looking over my shoulder
like my life is on hold.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.933
I am not a real person!

15:35.760 --> 15:36.936
[sighing]

15:36.979 --> 15:38.198
Thank you.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.722
[thunder rumbling]

15:46.032 --> 15:48.034
[line ringing]

15:48.077 --> 15:51.037
- You've reached the voicemail
of Jack Kline...

15:51.080 --> 15:52.777
[indistinct chatter]

15:52.821 --> 15:57.130
- BP is 130 over 100,
temp is 38.3,

15:57.173 --> 15:58.870
O2 sats 98!

15:58.914 --> 16:00.829
- Mr. Gupta,
tell me what happened.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.744
- You know this man?
- Yeah, I saw him yesterday

16:02.787 --> 16:05.790
for an infected puncture wound
on his right thigh.

16:08.271 --> 16:11.013
- No pulse, leg's ischemic.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.233
Was it cold and pale yesterday?
- No, but his wound

16:13.276 --> 16:14.843
has been slow to heal.
Ultrasound.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.063
Mr.Gupta, did something
re-aggravate your wound?

16:17.106 --> 16:18.194
[groaning in pain]

16:18.238 --> 16:20.414
Sameer, I need to know
what happened.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.720
They didn't even want
the note.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.767
When I climbed the ladder,
it started.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.725
- Five milligrams morphine!

16:27.769 --> 16:30.380
There's no flow in
the dorsalis pedis artery,

16:30.424 --> 16:33.035
Dr. Atwater. Thrombosis?
- Arterial dissection?

16:33.079 --> 16:37.605
- Pseudoaneurysm can develop at
the femoral artery after trauma.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.389
- We need more imaging
to confirm.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.478
- What is happening to me?

16:41.522 --> 16:43.611
- There's a blockage
in an artery in your leg,

16:43.654 --> 16:45.830
and the blood supply
is being cut off.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.658
- You need a procedure
to resolve it, Sameer,

16:47.702 --> 16:49.965
or you're going
to lose this limb.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.488
Okay, put an IV in,

16:51.532 --> 16:53.229
I need two grams ancef,
one liter of NS.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.927
And let's him to CT angio
to check out the blood vessel.

16:55.971 --> 16:58.495
- Is there someone you'd like us
to call for you, Mr. Gupta?

16:58.539 --> 17:01.498
[machine beeping]

17:05.981 --> 17:09.550
- Dr. Leblanc! An ER nurse said
you'd be in today.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.073
- Have you been here all night?

17:11.117 --> 17:13.380
- His son is flying in,
but he doesn't land for a while.

17:13.423 --> 17:16.731
Warren's opened his eyes
a couple times, but he just
drifts off right again.

17:16.773 --> 17:20.169
- Totally normal after
the trauma and surgery
he went through.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.127
Isn't there some place else
you need to be?

17:22.171 --> 17:24.304
- I don't want him to be alone
when he does wake up.

17:24.347 --> 17:27.394
I feel like even
the half-stranger from down
the hall is better than no one.

17:27.436 --> 17:28.960
- That's admirable, but--

17:29.004 --> 17:32.486
- Also, I heard a nurse say that
his blood pressure is low,

17:32.529 --> 17:35.054
but I know he takes meds
for high blood pressure.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.751
- How do you know that?

17:36.794 --> 17:39.710
- I found some pills
in his pants.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.017
I left them for Dr. Weir,
but he just had a nurse tell me

17:42.061 --> 17:44.106
that they have
everything in hand.
No one tells me anything

17:44.150 --> 17:46.326
because I'm not family,
and you were so great yesterday.

17:46.369 --> 17:49.155
So I thought maybe if I told you
about his blood pressure--

17:49.198 --> 17:50.591
- Alison, um...

17:50.634 --> 17:53.159
you need to trust his team
to handle it.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.378
You should go home.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.598
Get some rest.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.474
- Morning, Mr. Brezina.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.695
- So yesterday they tell me
my shoulder needs an operation,

18:07.738 --> 18:09.392
but they need to run a bunch
of tests first,

18:09.436 --> 18:12.526
and now the nurses are saying
it might not even happen today?

18:12.569 --> 18:15.050
- Right. Well, that's
what I wanted to discuss.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.531
Blood work is showing that your
kidney function is impaired.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.663
- Okay, that's my own
damn fault.

18:19.707 --> 18:22.318
I eat like crap.
Drink too much, I know.

18:22.362 --> 18:26.017
- Actually, I was concerned
about a condition called
aplastic anemia.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.932
- What does that have to do
with my shoulder?

18:27.976 --> 18:30.152
- Nothing. It's a potentially
serious condition

18:30.196 --> 18:32.372
that prevents your body
from producing new blood cells.

18:32.415 --> 18:35.244
- How concerned
are we talking here?

18:35.288 --> 18:38.639
- Enough to want to rule it out
with a bone marrow biopsy.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.423
So a hematologist will be by
soon and we--

18:40.467 --> 18:42.512
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.906
You want to stick a needle
into my bone

18:44.949 --> 18:46.168
because you have a hunch?

18:46.212 --> 18:49.084
- It's not a hunch.
You're a mechanic.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.173
Benzene in gasoline is one
of the known causes.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.306
- This is why I don't go
to the doctor!

18:53.349 --> 18:54.698
You come in with
one little thing

18:54.742 --> 18:56.135
and leave with a whole
other set of problems!

18:56.178 --> 18:57.962
- This is a potentially
life-threatening condition

18:58.006 --> 19:00.574
we're talking about.
- Or it could be nothing.

19:00.617 --> 19:01.923
- That's what I'm saying.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.229
Can you talk
some sense here, Jed?

19:03.272 --> 19:05.144
- Give us a minute, Dr. Curtis.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.844
- Take this form
to the third floor,

19:09.887 --> 19:12.107
and then take one turn left,
and then one right.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.588
- Can I stay with him
for the X-ray?

19:14.631 --> 19:16.111
- How's it going, guys?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.026
Mr. Furst, we were hoping
you could take me

19:18.069 --> 19:20.594
through all the foods
that Dmitri ruled out during
his allergy tests.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.509
- While I walk him upstairs,

19:22.552 --> 19:24.119
make sure the techs
know what to look for.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.165
- It's cool, Dad.
He can take me.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.733
- Okay,

19:29.777 --> 19:31.735
I'll see you after.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.435
- I am looking for my husband.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.219
Sameer Gupta, someone called.

19:37.263 --> 19:40.396
- That was me, Ms. Gupta.
I'm Dr. Bashir Hamed.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.181
Right this way.

19:43.530 --> 19:44.835
- Jaan.

19:45.358 --> 19:48.230
- You called her, Dr. Hamed?
I didn't want to worry her!

19:48.274 --> 19:50.972
- He said it was an emergency!
Of course I should be worried.

19:51.015 --> 19:55.150
- Anju, I'm fine. There was
an aneurysm in my leg,
but they fixed it. Tell her.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.284
- Um, yes. Surgeons fed a small
wire through Sameer's artery

19:58.327 --> 20:00.808
to clear an obstruction caused
by an exposed nail.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.811
He's recovering, but because
the wound's still infected

20:03.854 --> 20:05.291
his temperature is elevated.

20:05.334 --> 20:09.425
- A nail in your leg?
And this happened at the office?

20:10.383 --> 20:12.472
You said you were promoted.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.648
No more crawl spaces or ladders.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.737
- There are nails at the office!

20:18.173 --> 20:21.132
- Would you lie to your wife
about your job, Dr. Hamed?

20:21.176 --> 20:23.526
- He doesn't have to. He's doing
the job he was meant to do!

20:23.570 --> 20:26.834
- And all my husband does is
punish himself because he's not!

20:26.877 --> 20:29.053
- Can we fight about this
when I feel better?

20:29.097 --> 20:31.969
- Before you were fine. When
things get real, you're sick?

20:32.013 --> 20:33.057
- Anju.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.800
- I want to go home, Sameer.
- Yes, okay.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.499
The doctors have it handled.
I'll be home in no time.

20:39.542 --> 20:42.719
- You know what I meant.
Our home.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.854
Jaan, it's time. You're the only
one who can't see it.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.377
- I'll give you a minute.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.814
- Wait. I need a blood test.

20:50.858 --> 20:54.470
- Anju, why? Are you okay?

20:54.514 --> 20:56.777
- I'm pregnant, Sameer.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.301
Or at least I think I am.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.782
Now you see how it feels
to be kept in the dark.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.965
[rain pattering]

21:13.359 --> 21:16.275
[gentle music]

21:24.718 --> 21:26.372
- Congratulations.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.766
- You know, I took two
home tests,

21:29.810 --> 21:31.942
but I didn't trust them.

21:31.986 --> 21:34.205
We tried for so long.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.817
- Would you like to see
your baby?

21:37.644 --> 21:39.298
Lie back for me.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.351
- You know, in my faith,

21:49.395 --> 21:52.485
you tie a door when you ask
for a blessing.

21:53.399 --> 21:56.140
And we asked one
before we came here.

21:56.184 --> 22:01.145
But I'd given up,
but Sameer never gives up.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.452
- Yes, I noticed.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.325
It's going to be
a little cold.

22:09.893 --> 22:14.898
Heartbeat is strong.
I'd say about eight weeks.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.382
- It wasn't his dream
to come to Canada, it was mine.

22:20.426 --> 22:24.343
I said that there would be more
opportunity for us.

22:24.821 --> 22:28.347
It is always like that.
I dream and he does.

22:28.390 --> 22:32.133
Sameer worked so hard
to make it happen,

22:32.829 --> 22:37.530
and we were both so excited.
But the reality...

22:38.095 --> 22:40.707
- Was, uh, not what
you expected?

22:41.447 --> 22:44.101
- I'm not saying it would be
easy to go back but...

22:44.145 --> 22:46.234
We had a life in Delhi.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.715
And we have family we miss.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.457
And he could be
an engineer there.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.984
Will Sameer be okay, Dr. Hamed?

22:58.594 --> 23:01.771
- He's still very weak.
And he needs a lot of rest,

23:01.815 --> 23:04.644
so his body can fight
the infection.

23:05.035 --> 23:07.821
- We wanted this for so long.

23:08.691 --> 23:11.738
What if it happened
at the wrong time?

23:13.609 --> 23:16.830
- So barium is harmless,
but gross.

23:16.873 --> 23:20.921
So for every sip you get down,
I'll take one too. Deal?

23:26.230 --> 23:28.537
Just think of it as a milkshake.

23:28.581 --> 23:30.931
A radioactive
chalk milkshake.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.978
So how you liking Toronto?

23:35.022 --> 23:37.851
Your dad seems to think
you're getting used to it.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.983
- Him and my mom really
want me to.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.595
- When I started
at this hospital,

23:42.638 --> 23:44.161
I remember knowing no-one.

23:44.205 --> 23:48.688
I used to eat alone in the caf
and I'd pretend to read.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.865
- I don't even go
to ours anymore.

23:51.908 --> 23:52.953
- Because the food sucks?

23:52.996 --> 23:55.434
- I almost never feel
like eating.

23:56.652 --> 24:00.351
Just because when I don't
have to...

24:00.395 --> 24:04.399
I feel better, like...
- You're in control?

24:06.227 --> 24:07.620
- I found this group online.

24:07.663 --> 24:10.492
Other people who feel
the same way.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.408
We sort of set goals
for each other

24:13.452 --> 24:15.149
and cheer each other on
when we make them.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.672
- What kind of goals?

24:17.194 --> 24:19.501
- Eating less calories.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.462
And, um...

24:25.551 --> 24:30.120
Throwing up if we eat
something bad.

24:32.906 --> 24:37.867
I know it shouldn't feel good,
but it does.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.696
- Why do you think
you're telling me this?

24:40.740 --> 24:43.525
- I know that
if I tell my dad...

24:47.747 --> 24:50.619
I know I should stop, but...

24:52.578 --> 24:54.971
- Dimitri, do you want to stop?

24:55.668 --> 24:57.931
- I don't know how.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.934
- Well, I can help with that.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.546
And I can be there
when you talk to your dad,

25:04.590 --> 25:07.070
if you think that
would make it easier.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.733
- Frank's testosterone is low.

25:19.430 --> 25:20.910
- You're thinking andropause?

25:20.954 --> 25:22.738
- And when you give him
the results of his scope,

25:22.782 --> 25:24.523
you should tell him that too.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.568
- I won't be giving him
either of those results.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.265
- I'm pretty sure
he doesn't want to see me.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.485
And you seem to have a problem
with how I deal with him, so...

25:30.529 --> 25:32.443
- Frank's afraid, June.

25:32.487 --> 25:35.577
And like most of us,
he covers with bravado.

25:35.621 --> 25:39.538
You may have to peel back
yours to make room for him
to do the same.

25:41.322 --> 25:44.238
- So you want me to act weak
so he can feel strong?

25:45.152 --> 25:47.807
- Maybe there's a way for you
to meet him in the middle.

25:52.246 --> 25:55.510
- A stressed-out resident of
Dr. Weir's was looking for you.

25:56.293 --> 26:00.733
Something about needing
a consult for the exposed liver
patient you had yesterday.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.778
- No, it's not Weir
who needs me, it's Alison.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.824
The bystander who saved
Warren's life.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.130
She heard his blood pressure
was low and she's now convinced

26:07.174 --> 26:09.306
I'm the person
to interrogate it with her.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.917
- Do you think she's right?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.441
- No, I think I should stay
out of it, and so should she,

26:13.484 --> 26:14.790
but she won't let it go.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.750
- So her relentlessness
irritates you?

26:18.751 --> 26:20.622
- Yes, I see the irony.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.190
- Should I let them know
you're coming?

26:28.325 --> 26:30.501
- Dr. Leblanc, you came.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.068
- Well, you left me no choice.

26:32.112 --> 26:33.722
I have a roster of patients
in Emerg,

26:33.766 --> 26:36.464
but senior surgeons are
dragging me here because of you.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.945
- Who? Weir? I haven't
seen him all day!

26:38.988 --> 26:41.382
Just different residents
every three hours and each time

26:41.425 --> 26:42.601
I'm the one bringing them
up to speed.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.820
- Alison, I spoke to
Dr. Weir myself.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.997
Warren's blood pressure is low,
but in the acceptable range.

26:48.041 --> 26:51.958
- But it's dropping in waves,
and each time it levels,

26:52.001 --> 26:54.351
it's a little bit lower
and his breathing gets shallow.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.005
- Okay, stop.
You just have to stop!

26:56.049 --> 26:58.834
- I can't. Look,
maybe you don't understand,

26:58.878 --> 27:01.489
but I know that if I walk away

27:01.532 --> 27:03.622
when I could have
made a difference...

27:03.665 --> 27:06.233
That's just not the kind
of person that I want to be.

27:06.276 --> 27:09.802
Look I've been watching him
more than anyone else
for a full day now,

27:09.845 --> 27:13.327
and I'm telling you,
he's paler than he was before.

27:13.849 --> 27:16.809
Now, you're the one who found
the injury underneath his liver.

27:16.852 --> 27:21.161
If you tell me that he's okay,
I promise I'll accept it.

27:23.859 --> 27:26.122
- Okay, Alison. One more look.

27:26.166 --> 27:27.776
- Thank you.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.570
- It's impossible.

27:39.614 --> 27:40.833
- What?

27:40.876 --> 27:43.792
- A foreign body near
Warren's heart.

27:43.836 --> 27:46.316
Could be glass from
the accident.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.842
They would have imaged his
abdomen where the wound was.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.409
But maybe it travelled through
his bloodstream.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.585
- What does that mean?

27:54.629 --> 27:57.327
- That you may have just saved
his life again.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.293
- Khaled?

28:06.336 --> 28:09.470
- Dr. Hamed, this is Jack Kline.

28:09.513 --> 28:12.516
- Is Khaled okay?
Tell him I haven't left.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.346
- Unfortunately, Khaled's
in immigration hold for now.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.914
- He's been arrested? He told me
you said that wouldn't happen.

28:18.958 --> 28:21.743
- Well, when an appellant is
in violation of a previous order

28:21.787 --> 28:24.093
border services can request
detention.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.227
I was hopeful they
wouldn't go that route,
but it is where we are.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.620
- You have to get him out.
- We're working on it.

28:29.664 --> 28:32.754
The good news is that Khaled's
not a security threat.

28:32.798 --> 28:35.539
I'll petition release pending
processing of his appeal.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.890
It just may take some time.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.326
- How much time?

28:39.369 --> 28:41.502
- 24 hours at least.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.634
Go back to Toronto, Dr. Hamed.

28:43.678 --> 28:46.681
There's really nothing else
you can do here.

28:47.813 --> 28:48.988
[sighing]

28:49.031 --> 28:50.032
[thunder rumbling]

28:50.076 --> 28:52.513
[in Arabic]

29:06.788 --> 29:08.703
[loud banging]

29:15.579 --> 29:17.364
[locks clicking]

29:34.903 --> 29:36.818
[chains rattle]

29:38.777 --> 29:40.909
[rapid breathing]

30:42.188 --> 30:43.929
[groaning]

30:48.629 --> 30:51.414
- Mr. Gupta, what are you
doing out of bed?

30:52.459 --> 30:57.725
- Anju hasn't come to see me.
I need to talk to her.

30:57.768 --> 31:00.859
- Anju is fine. She just needs
a little bit of time.

31:00.902 --> 31:04.384
Okay, I'm concerned that
your infection has spread to
your blood stream.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.734
It's called bacteraemia and
it could be lethal.

31:06.777 --> 31:09.563
Let me take you back
to your room.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.873
- I promised her a future here.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.443
If we go home now,

31:20.487 --> 31:24.795
I fail my wife and my child.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.713
Do you understand?

31:32.891 --> 31:36.982
- The life I built and
the home I knew...

31:37.504 --> 31:40.028
doesn't exist anymore.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.991
I would give anything
to get that back.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.343
Let me take you back
to your room.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.965
Hey! His heart-rate's elevated
and he's cold and clammy.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.315
Tell the intensivist he could be
in septic shock.

32:06.359 --> 32:08.361
Go! Sameer! Sameer!

32:08.404 --> 32:10.711
[dramatic music]

32:11.016 --> 32:14.454
- Since when aren't we honest
with each other?

32:15.150 --> 32:19.372
Why won't you talk to me?
Whatever it is, I need to know.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.852
- Guys? Is everything okay?

32:21.896 --> 32:23.811
Because I got the results
back from imaging,

32:23.854 --> 32:26.031
there's no signs
of obstruction or ulcers.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.728
- So it is psychological then?

32:27.771 --> 32:30.949
That's what the other doctor,
the kid, just told me.

32:32.254 --> 32:33.952
- I am...

32:33.995 --> 32:37.564
I'm very sorry. You never
should have heard that from him.

32:38.478 --> 32:41.655
- Dima? Whatever it is,
we can fix it.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.613
- There's nothing to fix!

32:43.657 --> 32:46.355
He just told you,
the tests didn't find anything.

32:46.399 --> 32:47.922
Can't we just go?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.228
- No.

32:49.576 --> 32:53.014
No. Not until one of you
tells me what's going on.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.537
- We all need to just...

32:54.581 --> 32:58.933
take a deep breath and
we'll talk this through, okay?

33:07.942 --> 33:12.425
- The lab rushed your biopsy
and it's not aplastic anemia.

33:12.947 --> 33:16.733
I know it's been
a stressful time, but uh,
we had to check.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.735
- Let me guess, you have another
theory about why I'm anemic.

33:18.779 --> 33:21.956
- Actually we know why.
You have low T.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.133
Sometimes it's called
andropause, but basically

33:25.177 --> 33:28.441
it just means that
your testosterone levels
are declining.

33:32.619 --> 33:37.363
I mean, sometimes, this happens
when men get older.

33:38.581 --> 33:42.194
You know, this is pretty
good news considering
the alternative, Mr. Brezina.

33:42.237 --> 33:44.457
- That I'm basically
less of a man?

33:44.500 --> 33:46.676
- You just supplement
your testosterone,

33:46.720 --> 33:49.027
make some lifestyle changes,
and on the surface,

33:49.070 --> 33:51.638
it just looks like you're taking
better care of yourself.

33:53.596 --> 33:56.643
- But underneath,
I'm a blubbering mess.

33:58.645 --> 34:00.560
- I mean, show me someone
who isn't, right?

34:00.603 --> 34:05.086
- I can't remember the last time
I let a woman see me cry.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.088
- Same here.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.263
[chuckles]

34:08.306 --> 34:09.743
Look, you'll be fine.

34:09.786 --> 34:13.007
And I'll get that shoulder
fixed ASAP.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.056
- Thanks, though.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.492
- Yeah.

34:21.146 --> 34:23.670
[gentle music]

34:24.540 --> 34:25.889
- It's very serious,
Mrs. Gupta.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.804
The surgeons need to cut out
the infected tissue

34:27.848 --> 34:29.589
from beneath his original
puncture wound

34:29.632 --> 34:31.460
to keep it from poisoning
his bloodstream.

34:31.504 --> 34:32.983
- Will that save him?

34:33.027 --> 34:34.637
- We'll do our best.

34:35.333 --> 34:36.813
- Sameer!

34:36.857 --> 34:38.250
- Anju!

34:41.166 --> 34:44.125
- I don't care where we are,

34:44.168 --> 34:46.257
as long as we're together.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.565
- There's my husband.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.047
- It's time.

34:54.701 --> 34:57.051
- You come back to your family.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.274
[gentle music]

35:16.984 --> 35:19.508
[soft piano music]

35:41.226 --> 35:44.054
- I realized I hadn't eaten
all day.

35:46.622 --> 35:49.016
What? What happened?

35:49.059 --> 35:51.801
- They did everything
they could,

35:51.845 --> 35:54.152
but the glass pierced
his heart.

35:56.937 --> 35:59.505
- Warren's dead?

36:03.509 --> 36:05.511
Were we too late?

36:05.902 --> 36:07.774
- I'm so sorry, Alison.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.691
His body was still weak,
recovering from trauma,

36:11.734 --> 36:14.172
which makes it harder
to survive a major surgery.

36:14.824 --> 36:18.132
- Then, if I hadn't pushed
for us to do something...

36:18.176 --> 36:19.307
Did I cause this?

36:19.351 --> 36:21.309
- No. This was not your fault.

36:22.702 --> 36:24.791
- But I got involved.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.449
And now I'm grieving someone
I don't even know.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.103
Do you know what that's like?

36:34.366 --> 36:37.630
If I was never going
to be able to help him,

36:38.152 --> 36:40.154
then what was the point?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.641
- Frank found out about
his low T? How'd he take it?

36:48.684 --> 36:50.338
- No, he handled it.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.340
But you think maybe you could
just pretend I didn't tell you?

36:52.384 --> 36:53.776
I don't think he wants
anyone to know.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.256
- Good point.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.258
- Hey. Do you know if
Sameer Gupta's still in surgery?

36:57.302 --> 36:58.912
- Uh, I haven't heard anything.
You want me to call?

36:58.955 --> 37:01.219
- Yes, please.
- Do you have any idea
what you did?

37:01.262 --> 37:03.133
Breaking Dmitri's
confidence like that?

37:03.177 --> 37:04.526
- Dr. Hunter, that wasn't...

37:04.570 --> 37:06.267
The father kept asking
so many questions

37:06.311 --> 37:07.877
about what else it might be,

37:07.921 --> 37:10.010
I didn't know.
- No. You don't know,

37:10.053 --> 37:12.099
you know nothing!
- Dr. Hunter.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.626
[phones ringing]

37:19.106 --> 37:21.239
- You have charts to finish.

37:30.117 --> 37:33.207
- Tell Mr. Kline
it's Bashir Hamed calling again.

37:33.773 --> 37:36.558
I'm waiting for his call.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.257
Yes. Yes. Hamed.

37:41.520 --> 37:45.393
Hey.
- Hey. Where are you going?

37:45.437 --> 37:49.092
- To check on a patient. You?

37:49.136 --> 37:51.399
- Uh. I don't know, actually.

37:51.443 --> 37:54.837
I was supposed to get off
on one, but I didn't.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.579
- I, uh...

37:57.623 --> 38:01.148
I heard about your liver
laceration. He died?

38:01.191 --> 38:02.497
- Yeah.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.285
- How's your good samaritan?

38:08.286 --> 38:10.288
- Blaming herself.

38:10.331 --> 38:13.943
Asking why she even got
involved at all.

38:15.075 --> 38:18.818
- Because that's who she is.
And no one else would have.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.606
- It's not fair.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.218
How you see me.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.840
[sighing]

38:51.241 --> 38:52.330
- You left this for me?

38:52.852 --> 38:56.029
- Yes, a letter
to your program director,

38:56.072 --> 38:59.206
and a formal offer for you
to do your clinical hours here

38:59.249 --> 39:01.077
when they officially start
next month.

39:01.121 --> 39:04.516
- So I don't get to even
consider any other options?

39:04.559 --> 39:07.257
Thank you for deciding
my future for me.

39:07.301 --> 39:10.435
- I'm not deciding anything,
Claire. I'm just...

39:10.478 --> 39:12.045
I'm just making an offer.

39:12.088 --> 39:15.004
- No, you're trying
to hold on to me.

39:20.053 --> 39:23.665
I know you don't want things
to change, Jed,

39:23.709 --> 39:25.972
but they already have.

39:26.015 --> 39:30.150
And you're acting like
you're facing all this head on,

39:30.193 --> 39:32.239
but you haven't once told me
what you feel

39:32.282 --> 39:34.807
about the fact that
you can't work on patients.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.417
- I'm adjusting.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.984
- No.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.856
You're deflecting.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.424
There's a difference.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.300
[siren blaring]

39:57.786 --> 39:59.571
- Heard you were looking for me?

39:59.614 --> 40:02.661
- Yeah, you, uh,
you got a minute?

40:02.704 --> 40:04.489
- Didn't have you pegged
as a smoker.

40:04.532 --> 40:07.230
- A secret and
very infrequent vice.

40:08.710 --> 40:10.756
- I really messed up there.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.497
- No, I did.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.325
Putting the dad on you,
knowing how he is.

40:15.369 --> 40:20.026
And then losing it on you?
It's not cool.

40:22.245 --> 40:25.074
- Did I tell you both
my parents are surgeons?

40:25.118 --> 40:27.076
- So you're used
to perfectionist doctors?

40:27.120 --> 40:30.732
- Perfectionist,
divorced doctors.

40:31.472 --> 40:34.475
They split when I was 14. And...

40:34.519 --> 40:38.044
when the myth
of perfection ended,

40:38.087 --> 40:41.264
they got to just,
I don't know,

40:42.527 --> 40:45.007
be themselves, I guess.

40:47.401 --> 40:49.229
[gentle music]

40:50.099 --> 40:52.058
- I'll see you tomorrow, Jake.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.776
[sigh]

41:32.272 --> 41:34.666
- I was glad to hear how well
you're responding, Sameer.

41:34.709 --> 41:37.712
Your surgeons tell me
you'll likely be discharged
in a few days.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.409
- Thank you.

41:40.062 --> 41:42.761
- The next time I ask
for a blessing,

41:42.804 --> 41:47.200
it will be for you to find
your way home again.

41:55.861 --> 41:58.080
[line ringing]

41:59.995 --> 42:03.869
- Dr. Hamed. I'm sorry
I haven't gotten back to you.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.827
- It's been two weeks,
Mr. Kline.

42:05.871 --> 42:07.568
- I know.
- You said Khaled would only be

42:07.612 --> 42:09.614
in detention one day.
- I know. But he's okay.

42:09.657 --> 42:12.573
His spirits are good,
considering, and we are doing
everything we can.

42:12.617 --> 42:15.489
- Whatever it takes.
If it's a question of money,
I'll pay it.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.578
- Khaled asked me
to pass along his thanks.

42:17.622 --> 42:21.539
And I continue to believe
our appeal has a chance. But...

42:22.452 --> 42:24.977
Well, you may want to get
your head around the idea

42:25.020 --> 42:28.850
that if things don't work out,
he could be deported.

42:33.507 --> 42:36.641
