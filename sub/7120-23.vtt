WEBVTT

00:10.049 --> 00:12.315
Don't forget LSP's diet cola.

00:12.385 --> 00:13.409
I won't.

00:13.486 --> 00:15.388
I really do love "Finn
and Jake Movie Club."

00:15.456 --> 00:16.981
Okay, everybody.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.221
Apple juice for Tree Trunks...

00:19.294 --> 00:21.627
diet soda for LSP...

00:21.697 --> 00:22.858
Eh...

00:22.931 --> 00:24.093
What did you order, PB?

00:24.167 --> 00:26.295
Oh, I brought my own.

00:28.405 --> 00:29.405
Huh.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.036
Iced latté for M'lady.

00:32.110 --> 00:33.601
Tomato juice for Marceline.

00:33.678 --> 00:34.771
Thanks, Finn.

00:34.846 --> 00:36.247
Hot cocoa for Beemo.

00:36.315 --> 00:38.147
<i>This does compute.</i>

00:38.217 --> 00:40.687
And, finally, a thimble
of milk for Shelby,

00:40.754 --> 00:42.416
the worm who lives
in Jake's viola.

00:42.489 --> 00:44.014
You can just call me "Shelby."

00:44.091 --> 00:45.424
Jake?

00:45.493 --> 00:47.689
We're so excited that you
could be here tonight for

00:47.762 --> 00:49.231
"Finn and Jake's Movie Club's"

00:49.298 --> 00:51.233
feature presentation...

00:51.300 --> 00:53.429
"Heat Signature 3."

00:53.503 --> 00:54.334
Oh, with the submarine?

00:54.404 --> 00:55.235
Sounds great.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.534
Get on with it!

01:00.979 --> 01:03.107
Princess Bubblegum's in my seat.

01:03.181 --> 01:05.674
We decided last time
no reserved seating...

01:05.752 --> 01:09.086
First come, first served.

01:13.795 --> 01:15.093
What's that?

01:15.163 --> 01:17.108
Just stuff that comes at the
beginning of the movies.

01:17.132 --> 01:19.159
Yeah, it's on all the
movies we dig up.

01:19.235 --> 01:20.066
I don't know.

01:20.136 --> 01:22.072
It seems pretty important, Finn.

01:22.139 --> 01:22.970
All right.

01:23.040 --> 01:23.939
Let's take a look.

01:24.007 --> 01:25.703
Pause, Beemo.

01:25.776 --> 01:29.077
"Warning... federal law
provides severe and criminal

01:29.147 --> 01:31.913
penalties for the unauthorized

01:31.984 --> 01:37.151
exhibition of copyrighted
motion pictures."

01:37.223 --> 01:38.156
All right, well, goodbye!

01:38.224 --> 01:40.421
Sorry we had to cancel.

01:40.494 --> 01:43.294
We've been showing these
films unauthorized!

01:43.365 --> 01:46.062
But these movies are before
the Great Mushroom War.

01:46.134 --> 01:48.661
We should still respect
authority, Mang.

01:51.909 --> 01:52.740
Yeah?

01:52.810 --> 01:55.212
Are we meeting next
week to watch a movie?

01:55.280 --> 01:56.373
Uh...

01:56.448 --> 01:58.349
Uh, yeah, maybe. I-I think so.

01:58.416 --> 02:01.251
Finn, don't cancel movie club!

02:01.320 --> 02:04.758
I've literally been having
the time of my life.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.785
Calm down, y'all.

02:07.862 --> 02:08.939
We're gonna have "Finn
and Jake Movie Club"

02:08.963 --> 02:10.693
next week for sure.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.944
Jake and I just have to find a
movie without that warning.

02:12.968 --> 02:14.596
Good! Okay.

02:14.670 --> 02:16.048
All right, well, we'll
see you next time!

02:16.072 --> 02:17.870
Bye-bye!

02:17.941 --> 02:21.379
Dude, we've never found a
movie without that warning.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.346
<i>We're not gonna
find a movie, Jake.</i>

02:26.818 --> 02:27.898
Well, what are we gonna do?

02:29.222 --> 02:31.919
We're gonna make one!

02:31.991 --> 02:33.221
Wow-p!

02:33.293 --> 02:37.493
Movie filming time!

02:37.565 --> 02:38.565
Okay, Beemo.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.762
Turn to your right
and start filming.

02:40.836 --> 02:42.270
Start to truck in.

02:42.338 --> 02:43.863
Keep going.

02:43.939 --> 02:45.499
Keep trucking in, Beemo.

02:45.575 --> 02:46.575
Huh?

02:46.643 --> 02:48.009
That was awesome, Beemo!

02:48.078 --> 02:49.513
Yeah. Fantastic. Super.

02:49.580 --> 02:51.014
Don't lose her, Beemo.

02:51.082 --> 02:52.710
Front shot! Front shot!

02:52.784 --> 02:55.220
Film the clouds!

02:55.287 --> 02:57.519
Don't forget the little one!

02:59.759 --> 03:00.759
Beemo!

03:00.794 --> 03:01.728
Beemo, you're gonna miss it!

03:01.796 --> 03:03.287
Over there, to your right!

03:07.502 --> 03:08.333
Oh, we're gonna miss it!

03:08.403 --> 03:09.928
Hurry, Beemo!

03:10.006 --> 03:11.565
Don't lose it!

03:11.641 --> 03:12.785
Oh, looks like it's gonna fall!

03:12.809 --> 03:14.472
Follow it!

03:14.545 --> 03:16.377
Look over there...
Across the river!

03:16.447 --> 03:17.972
Beemo, forget about the coin!

03:18.048 --> 03:19.108
Film that over there!

03:20.185 --> 03:21.915
Zoom in.

03:23.022 --> 03:25.218
Weird. Let's get
some more footage.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.035 --> 03:34.934
Whee!

03:35.003 --> 03:37.404
Whee!

03:39.074 --> 03:41.806
Nom! Nom! Nom! Nom!

03:43.614 --> 03:44.980
Like that?

03:45.049 --> 03:46.483
Yeah! Perfect!

03:46.550 --> 03:47.644
Are y-you sure?

03:47.719 --> 03:49.210
<i>Yeah! Looks great!</i>

03:49.287 --> 03:50.287
Wait, what about this?

03:50.322 --> 03:51.882
<i>That's even better!</i>

03:51.958 --> 03:53.551
Uh...

03:53.626 --> 03:54.559
What do you think?

03:54.627 --> 03:55.891
I don't get it.

03:55.963 --> 03:57.932
It's just a bunch
of random junk.

03:57.998 --> 03:59.398
Yeah, I'm not engaged.

03:59.466 --> 04:00.730
I need to see something that

04:00.802 --> 04:01.963
reflects life as it is,

04:02.036 --> 04:03.527
but, you know, entertaining.

04:03.605 --> 04:05.472
Yeah, like a romantic comedy.

04:05.541 --> 04:07.601
Exactly... an action adventure.

04:07.676 --> 04:09.009
Wait, that's not what I said.

04:09.079 --> 04:10.308
Let's get to filming!

04:10.380 --> 04:12.577
Okay, Slime Princess!

04:12.650 --> 04:15.620
In this scene, you're gonna
leap over to that vine...

04:15.686 --> 04:17.713
swing over the crocodiles...

04:17.789 --> 04:21.420
do a triple flip with a
full twist, and land clean!

04:21.494 --> 04:24.020
Don't fall in the water,
or you'll get eaten alive!

04:24.097 --> 04:25.532
Action!

04:34.410 --> 04:36.072
No! No smooching!

04:36.145 --> 04:37.010
Cut!

04:37.079 --> 04:38.446
I thought it was great.

04:38.515 --> 04:40.814
No, we can't use any of it.

04:40.884 --> 04:42.683
I think we should use all of it.

04:42.754 --> 04:43.813
No, not all.

04:43.888 --> 04:45.032
We should throw away the parts

04:45.056 --> 04:46.753
where Slime Princess
was smooching.

04:46.825 --> 04:47.690
That was dumb.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.591
What?!

04:48.661 --> 04:51.257
Du-u-u-u-u-u-u-mbah!

04:51.331 --> 04:53.732
Okay, you're having a picnic.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.635
You're in love, but
you can't admit it.

04:56.704 --> 04:58.640
So you're having a
playful food fight.

04:58.707 --> 05:00.369
And action!

05:01.543 --> 05:03.570
Why did you do that?!

05:08.752 --> 05:09.776
Cut, cut, cut!

05:11.122 --> 05:11.987
Cut!

05:12.057 --> 05:13.355
That was not what I wanted!

05:13.425 --> 05:14.859
That was awesome!

05:14.926 --> 05:17.123
We need to shoot more
stuff like that.

05:18.464 --> 05:19.558
What's next?

05:22.436 --> 05:24.497
Okay, PB.

05:24.572 --> 05:26.666
Move back a little.

05:26.741 --> 05:28.734
Stop!

05:28.811 --> 05:29.972
- Finn?
- Yeah?

05:30.045 --> 05:31.878
How does this work?

05:31.948 --> 05:32.813
Um...

05:32.882 --> 05:34.093
Jake's gonna get the frog to hop

05:34.117 --> 05:35.814
toward him, and when he does,

05:35.886 --> 05:37.821
you're gonna run
alongside the chariot,

05:37.888 --> 05:39.914
and it's gonna look
like you're driving it.

05:39.992 --> 05:40.891
Okay.

05:40.959 --> 05:41.790
Hey, Finn.

05:41.860 --> 05:42.691
Yeah?

05:42.761 --> 05:43.805
How about when the
chariot takes off,

05:43.829 --> 05:47.267
she says something like,
"Mm, check, please!"

05:47.333 --> 05:48.267
What?!

05:48.335 --> 05:50.600
No, that's terrible.

05:50.671 --> 05:52.766
And... action!

06:00.616 --> 06:02.313
Check, please?

06:02.386 --> 06:03.386
Aw, Jake!

06:03.420 --> 06:05.583
You... you brought the
fly in too close!

06:05.657 --> 06:06.818
I'm sorry.

06:06.891 --> 06:07.984
Well, help me catch him.

06:11.664 --> 06:13.361
Well, I thought it was funny.

06:13.433 --> 06:15.026
This isn't a comedy!

06:15.101 --> 06:16.831
Not the way you're shooting it.

06:16.903 --> 06:18.566
Look, just help me
catch this guy.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.608
All right, but after
this, we do my part.

06:21.843 --> 06:23.937
Okay, everyone, it's
been a long day.

06:24.012 --> 06:25.241
Lot of...

06:26.349 --> 06:28.341
a lot of running
around, chasing frogs.

06:29.519 --> 06:32.217
But we are making a movie, and
this is the big wedding scene.

06:32.289 --> 06:35.021
Mr. Cupcake, you're
playing Todd Johnson.

06:35.093 --> 06:36.391
Yes.

06:36.461 --> 06:38.829
And, Lady, you confess
that you never loved

06:38.898 --> 06:40.075
Todd Johnson and that you were

06:40.099 --> 06:41.692
just trying to win a bet with

06:41.767 --> 06:43.498
your snooty socialite friends.

06:44.604 --> 06:47.803
And then you both realize
you do love each other,

06:47.875 --> 06:49.901
and you both say, "I do."

06:49.977 --> 06:52.106
And then, Shelby, you say...

06:52.181 --> 06:54.173
"Check, please!"

06:55.485 --> 06:56.350
Yeah.

06:56.419 --> 06:58.130
Don't forget to look right in
the camera and slap your cheeks

06:58.154 --> 06:59.555
like this...

07:01.592 --> 07:03.083
And...

07:03.160 --> 07:04.629
One, two, three, action!

07:04.696 --> 07:07.690
Do you, Todd Johnson,
take this Rainicorn

07:07.767 --> 07:09.668
to be your lawfully
married wife?

07:11.571 --> 07:12.596
Oh.

07:20.683 --> 07:22.049
Lady!

07:22.118 --> 07:24.714
Cut! Cut, cut, cut!

07:24.788 --> 07:26.620
I didn't tell you to flex out!

07:28.526 --> 07:29.526
No!

07:29.594 --> 07:31.495
I don't like the way
he's flexing at you!

07:31.562 --> 07:33.464
I don't hear her complaining.

07:33.532 --> 07:35.160
Why, you...

07:37.036 --> 07:38.629
Check, please!

07:41.742 --> 07:43.677
How much longer till you
finish editing, Beemo?

07:43.744 --> 07:45.213
About 20 hours.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.280
20 hours?!

07:46.348 --> 07:47.179
Yeah.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.547
You guys shot a
lot of footage...

07:48.617 --> 07:50.985
About 20 hours.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.580
Jake, let's talk
about our movie.

07:53.657 --> 07:54.955
Okay.

07:55.025 --> 07:56.891
I think we shot a lot
of great stuff...

07:56.960 --> 07:57.960
Uh-huh.

07:57.996 --> 08:00.465
But I'm thinking only
half of it is usable.

08:00.532 --> 08:01.660
Me too.

08:01.734 --> 08:02.758
Really?!

08:02.835 --> 08:04.303
Yeah, I was just thinking that.

08:04.370 --> 08:05.463
That's great!

08:05.538 --> 08:06.598
I know!

08:06.673 --> 08:07.572
You actually agree it's

08:07.641 --> 08:08.734
an action-adventure!

08:08.809 --> 08:11.211
Yep, it... wait! No!

08:11.279 --> 08:12.303
What?!

08:12.380 --> 08:13.814
Romantic comedy!

08:13.881 --> 08:14.815
What?!

08:14.883 --> 08:16.181
What do you mean, "What?!"

08:16.251 --> 08:17.583
Who's right, Beemo?

08:17.653 --> 08:19.418
Yeah! Me or Finn?!

08:21.791 --> 08:24.318
We'll ask him when he wakes up.

08:24.395 --> 08:25.590
Why wait?

08:25.663 --> 08:27.758
"Dear Beemo...

08:27.833 --> 08:32.772
please use only the best footage
when cutting the movie.

08:32.839 --> 08:35.035
Love, Jake."

08:35.107 --> 08:37.839
"And Finn."

08:37.910 --> 08:39.676
See you at the movie club, then!

08:39.746 --> 08:41.044
Oh, I'll be there!

08:41.115 --> 08:42.413
As will I.

08:42.484 --> 08:45.216
As will I as well.

08:53.297 --> 08:54.856
Yes. Oh, yes.

08:54.932 --> 08:56.993
Ugh! I can't wait! Oh!

08:57.069 --> 08:58.128
I can't wait!

08:59.338 --> 09:00.272
