00:40.473 --> 00:45.344
Mom! Mom!

00:45.344 --> 00:50.247
The dirt burned my hands!

00:58.157 --> 01:01.524
What's HazMat doing here?

01:02.562 --> 01:04.223
Kid's playing tag, takes a header in the dirt,

01:04.263 --> 01:06.299
ends up with first-degree
burns on his hands.

01:06.299 --> 01:08.529
Wait. We got a call
about a dead body.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.396
Yeah, I'm getting there.
So, HazMat arrives,

01:11.237 --> 01:13.535
figuring some sort
of chemical spill.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.741
Starts removing
the toxic soil and, bam,

01:15.741 --> 01:19.078
a shovel slams
into a shoulder blade.

01:19.078 --> 01:23.538
Clothing's been
reduced to shreds.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.552
Epidermal tissue
is virtually gone.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.554
The body's desiccate d.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.791
Viscous fluid the consistency
of dishwashing soap.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.326
HazMat guy was right.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.428
Killer doused
the body in lye.

01:35.428 --> 01:38.130
Must have thought
it would destroy the body.

01:38.130 --> 01:40.700
Yeah, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust...

01:40.700 --> 01:42.969
without the wait.

02:19.839 --> 02:24.076
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I need
to neutralize the soil.

02:24.076 --> 02:25.600
If you touch the soil,

02:25.645 --> 02:27.613
you're going to contaminate my crime

02:27.647 --> 02:29.248
but I'll let you know when I'm finished.

02:29.248 --> 02:31.148
Okay.

02:35.588 --> 02:36.756
What did you get?

02:36.756 --> 02:39.592
Vic's wallet...
what's left of it.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.527
It's a Nevada license.
Bob Martin.

02:41.527 --> 02:43.262
31. He lived downtown.

02:43.262 --> 02:45.331
There's 20 bucks in the flap.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.821
Rules out robbery.

03:01.814 --> 03:02.682
Look at this.

03:02.682 --> 03:08.287
Looks like a paint fleck...
or metal chip, maybe.

03:08.287 --> 03:10.653
What did the ranger say?

03:10.690 --> 03:13.459
Nobody saw anything suspicious.

03:13.459 --> 03:14.860
Park closes up at 10:00 p.m.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.696
No security,
minimal lighting.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.498
Basically, a pretty good place
to dump a body.

03:19.498 --> 03:21.634
You found this guy
in the park?

03:21.634 --> 03:23.269
Actually,
HazMat found him.

03:23.269 --> 03:26.906
Well, that explains the
postmortem scar tissue.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.308
Lye had a field day on his flesh.

03:29.308 --> 03:34.880
(sizzling)

03:34.880 --> 03:36.382
Time of death?

03:36.382 --> 03:38.680
Approximately 24 hours ago.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.819
Tell me about the car.

03:39.819 --> 03:42.488
Car? What car?

03:42.488 --> 03:44.256
Comminuted fractures

03:44.256 --> 03:48.127
of the proximal
third tib - fib, both legs.

03:48.127 --> 03:49.995
Bumper hits right
below the knees.

03:49.995 --> 03:52.691
Sure sign he was hit by a car.

03:53.966 --> 03:56.168
Look at all the bruising.

03:56.168 --> 03:59.438
If he was struck and killed,
ecchymosis would be nonexistent.

03:59.438 --> 04:02.274
Which suggests
he survived the impact.

04:02.274 --> 04:03.175
Usual injuries:

04:03.175 --> 04:06.011
Ruptured patellar tendon,

04:06.011 --> 04:07.546
laceration of the saphenous vein,

04:07.546 --> 04:11.482
and multiple incised wounds
containing slivers of glass,

04:11.751 --> 04:15.488
which I will send over to Trace.

04:15.488 --> 04:19.425
And bruises: Legs, arms and chest.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.428
What I didn't find was arterial lacerations

04:22.428 --> 04:24.063
or underlying vessel damage.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.198
Confirms death wasn't immediate?

04:26.198 --> 04:26.766
Correct.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.368
Victim was like
a leaky water balloon...

04:29.368 --> 04:32.404
heart slowly pumped blood
right out of his body.

04:32.404 --> 04:35.474
And, based on the coloration
of the bruises,

04:35.474 --> 04:36.709
trauma was sustained

04:36.709 --> 04:40.270
approximately 48 hours
before death.

04:41.113 --> 04:44.016
Three days ago,
this man was injured.

04:44.016 --> 04:46.418
He bled out
until he died yesterday.

04:46.418 --> 04:49.216
We didn't find any blood.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.028
Lockwood?

04:56.028 --> 04:57.396
Hey, Stokes.

04:57.396 --> 04:59.431
Who called it in?

04:59.431 --> 05:00.762
BLM chopper pilot.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.768
They always buzz Diablo Canyon

05:02.802 --> 05:05.471
looking for hikers in distress... or worse.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.806
He see anyone else in the vicinity?

05:06.806 --> 05:09.975
No, just the vic:
Stacy Warner, 26.

05:09.975 --> 05:11.310
Las Vegas resident.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.612
I scanned
for a Missing Persons on her.

05:13.612 --> 05:15.603
Nothing.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.253
No tire treads.

05:21.253 --> 05:22.354
Whose are these?

05:22.354 --> 05:24.788
Paramedics and mine.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.486
Same path. Walked
straight in, straight out.

05:29.028 --> 05:32.520
Engagement ring,
no wedding band.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.244
Orbital bone
looks fractured.

05:45.244 --> 05:48.180
Could have lost her footing,
hit her head.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.415
Could have.

05:49.415 --> 05:52.248
Hold that for me?

06:09.201 --> 06:10.369
Down feather.

06:10.369 --> 06:13.634
But she's not wearing a jacket.

06:18.210 --> 06:19.939
Shine that right here.

06:33.125 --> 06:36.128
Grissom should enjoy this.

06:36.128 --> 06:37.429
Hey, Lockwood,

06:37.429 --> 06:39.164
you got any food
in your vehicle?

06:39.164 --> 06:41.033
Hamburger? Anything like that?

06:41.033 --> 06:42.735
Gum, sugar-free.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.904
No. Gum will kill him.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.306
I'll stop at the
first place I see

06:47.306 --> 06:48.908
pick up some jerky.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.912
Will you get me a sample
of the ground

06:52.912 --> 06:54.470
underneath the body?

06:54.580 --> 06:55.915
Soon as the coroner moves her.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.008
Good.

07:02.788 --> 07:04.590
Bob is dead?

07:04.590 --> 07:06.592
His body was found at Sunset Park.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.890
His license gave this address.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.030
Are you his domestic partner?

07:11.030 --> 07:12.131
We're roommates.

07:12.131 --> 07:13.699
I got divorced
last year.

07:13.699 --> 07:16.896
And, about six months ago,
Bob's wife kicked him out.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.604
He needed a place
to crash

07:18.604 --> 07:20.606
and I needed help
with the mortgage.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.608
He's two months late on the rent.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.941
How do I go about collecting under the

07:29.248 --> 07:32.718
Look, we were roommates. We weren't

07:32.718 --> 07:34.687
When was the last time you saw him?

07:34.687 --> 07:35.915
We both work at the Tangiers.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.990
He managed the restaurant, and I work in

07:37.990 --> 07:39.591
Last Monday,
we drove in together.

07:39.591 --> 07:41.560
But you didn't drive home
together?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.294
Mondays? No.

07:42.294 --> 07:45.831
After shift, he'd walk over
to the university.

07:45.831 --> 07:47.633
He's an amateur photographer.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.930
Take the bus home.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.936
But he didn't come home
Monday night.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.631
I didn't think much of it.

07:52.671 --> 07:54.707
He's always going
back and forth
with Charlotte.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.108
His wife.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.376
What do I care?

07:57.376 --> 08:00.470
As long as the rent's paid.

08:09.254 --> 08:11.654
Photo Department
kept a log.

08:11.757 --> 08:13.952
Bob Martin reserved a darkroom on

08:13.993 --> 08:15.654
from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m.

08:15.694 --> 08:16.996
He was logged in
Monday night.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.598
Good. We got a bus to catch.

08:19.598 --> 08:22.123
(horn blaring)

08:26.672 --> 08:29.971
He left these photos behind. They're all
of the same woman.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.977
I bet it's his wife.

08:52.097 --> 08:53.866
Silver flecks...

08:53.866 --> 08:56.528
like the one you found
at the body.

08:59.438 --> 09:03.542
I got a piece of plastic.

09:03.542 --> 09:07.000
Looks like a headlight cover,
maybe.

09:07.379 --> 09:10.871
This could be our crime scene.

09:12.484 --> 09:14.887
(tires screech)

09:14.887 --> 09:18.015
Assuming this was a hit-and-run,

09:18.057 --> 09:20.355
how does a guy
with two broken legs end up

09:20.392 --> 09:24.021
on the other side of town buried
in a park, covered in lye?

09:26.632 --> 09:28.793
What are you looking for?

09:30.069 --> 09:32.037
No sign of blood.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.732
No evidence of a cleanup.

09:33.772 --> 09:35.637
If this is our crime scene,

09:35.741 --> 09:38.577
then somewhere between here and Sunset

09:38.577 --> 09:41.137
Bob Martin lost
eight to ten pints of blood.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.346
Where is it?

09:45.884 --> 09:49.288
So want to tell me about
the silver flecks I found?

09:49.288 --> 09:49.988
Paint chips?

09:49.988 --> 09:52.047
Aluminum and melamine in the color coat

09:52.091 --> 09:54.760
indicate that it's car paint.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.057
Factory job.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.792
Uh... body shop paint contains styrene, not

10:01.100 --> 10:02.768
Hmm. What type of car?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.066
Trick question. Paint won't tell me that.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.072
But I do have an answer.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.370
It's not technically part
of my job description

10:09.441 --> 10:11.068
but, as you know,
I'm always eager

10:11.110 --> 10:12.778
to expand my responsibilities.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.110
Take a look down the scope.

10:16.215 --> 10:19.118
Looks like some sort of insignia.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.285
Crosshairs.

10:20.285 --> 10:23.522
That's the plastic you collected at the

10:23.522 --> 10:29.128
Now, that mark is only found on the S-class

10:29.128 --> 10:31.096
It's all about branding.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.758
Now, knowing that the headlight came from

10:33.799 --> 10:35.801
I was able to compare the infrared spectra

10:35.801 --> 10:39.100
with the paint spectra supplied by the

10:39.138 --> 10:41.106
Check this out.

10:41.140 --> 10:45.099
Your vehicle was painted Sarasota Silver.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.547
Also, only available on
the S-series '99 models.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.883
I checked with
the Mercedes state rep.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.818
Five were sold in Nevada.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.820
Sara's tracking down the owners.

10:54.820 --> 10:58.824
You've, uh... already shared
this information with Sara?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.121
Yeah, an hour ago.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.961
And she was way more fascinated than you

11:02.961 --> 11:05.030
Well, I'm somewhat fascinated by the fact

11:05.030 --> 11:07.123
that I'm your boss, but you talked to her first.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.134
Well, you were at dinner.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.137
I've been in the lab
all day, Greg.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.843
I've been
looking for you.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.140
Well, it's hard
to see me

11:19.178 --> 11:21.146
if you and Greg
are out ahead of me.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.314
Oh, uh...
sorry about that

11:22.314 --> 11:25.147
Brass got me a list
of those Mercedes owners.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.153
One moved to Los Angeles,
three are over 50.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.155
My guess, they would have
stopped and rendered aid.

11:30.189 --> 11:34.148
Brass is checking them out. Which leaves
a Ben Weston, 25.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.162
Leased the vehicle
last week.

11:37.362 --> 11:39.198
You found my car?

11:39.198 --> 11:40.532
Why? Is your car missing?

11:40.532 --> 11:43.202
Yeah. Isn't that why
you guys are here?

11:43.202 --> 11:46.605
I filed a police report
a couple days ago.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.207
God, I love that car.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.198
Hocked my future on it.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.169
Tell me it hasn't been strip ped.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.280
You wouldn't happen to have a copy of that
police

11:55.280 --> 11:57.883
I'm a lawyer.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.475
Here you go.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.954
Thanks.

12:01.954 --> 12:06.091
Sarasota Silver, S-series,
stolen Monday night.

12:06.091 --> 12:08.293
Yeah. I stopped
for take out after work.

12:08.293 --> 12:09.361
When I came out, it was gone.

12:09.361 --> 12:13.599
Don't most of these luxury vehicles have

12:13.599 --> 12:15.767
What's with all the questions?

12:15.767 --> 12:17.903
We're investigating
a possible hit-and-run.

12:17.903 --> 12:22.203
You think the bastard
that stole my car hit someone?

12:23.008 --> 12:26.545
Ignacias High,
Nevada State University...

12:26.545 --> 12:27.479
Are you a local?

12:27.479 --> 12:29.348
Yeah. Great town.

12:29.348 --> 12:31.578
I studied my ass off in law school.

12:31.650 --> 12:32.884
Passed the bar first time.

12:32.884 --> 12:33.885
Good for you.

12:33.885 --> 12:35.216
Let me guess...

12:35.254 --> 12:36.255
criminal defense?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.223
Everyone deserves
representation.

12:38.257 --> 12:38.590
Yes, they do.

12:38.590 --> 12:42.219
Would you happen
to remember what clothes you were

12:42.261 --> 12:44.229
A blue pinstripe,
a light blue oxford,

12:44.263 --> 12:46.231
gray tie... gift from my girlfriend.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.767
First week as an associate. Firm like this...

12:48.767 --> 12:50.928
you tend to pay attention
to wardrobe.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.639
Mr. Weston, we'd like to take a look

12:53.639 --> 12:55.274
Really?

12:55.274 --> 12:58.243
Well, you need a warrant.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.212
But I'm a nice guy.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.244
I picked them up
at lunch.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.518
Downstairs...
one-hour dry cleaning.

13:06.518 --> 13:08.553
Nice suit.

13:08.553 --> 13:09.655
Thank you.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.520
I just bought it.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.261
I hope you didn't
just buy the shirt.

13:16.261 --> 13:18.252
Oh, come on.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.265
I've been meaning
to change dry cleaners.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.236
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have gotten lye on it. Lye is an alkali.

13:24.236 --> 13:25.871
And, when it's mixed with water,

13:25.871 --> 13:27.272
it eats right through fabric.

13:27.272 --> 13:29.263
Mr. Weston...

13:29.308 --> 13:31.276
you mind taking off your shirt?

13:31.310 --> 13:32.277
Excuse me?

13:32.311 --> 13:33.512
Lye can burn through fabric.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.314
It can also burn through skin.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.315
I have my limits.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.284
You want me to strip, you're going to need

13:39.318 --> 13:41.420
But, since there's no basis for your request,

13:41.420 --> 13:44.184
you can forget about it.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.194
She drowned.

13:49.194 --> 13:51.992
This is the girl I found
in the desert, man.

13:52.030 --> 13:54.294
I am aware of that. She drowned

13:54.333 --> 13:55.994
It's not possible, Dave -o.

13:56.034 --> 13:59.003
She was found in Diablo Canyon... miles
from the nearest

13:59.037 --> 14:01.006
Lake Mead's got to be 20 miles away.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.998
Desert, no desert... I don't care. She

14:04.042 --> 14:06.411
Look, if it's any consolation, she dry-drown

14:06.411 --> 14:07.045
Dry-drowned?

14:07.045 --> 14:10.310
Happens in about
ten percent of all cases.

14:10.349 --> 14:14.286
When dry-drowning occurs,
the larynx closes involuntarily,

14:14.286 --> 14:17.723
preventing air and water
from entering the lungs,

14:17.723 --> 14:19.315
resulting in hypoxia...

14:19.358 --> 14:22.027
a reduced concentration
of oxygen in the blood.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.262
Thus, water's
kept out of the lungs...

14:24.262 --> 14:24.930
dry -drowning.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.232
In wet drowning,
hypoxia also occurs,

14:27.232 --> 14:30.369
but the larynx relaxes
and water floods the lungs.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.872
Still, the question remains,
how does a girl drown

14:33.872 --> 14:36.274
in the middle
of the desert?

14:36.274 --> 14:37.571
She doesn't.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.479
She was engaged.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.714
The guy never filed a missing persons on

14:42.714 --> 14:46.318
I didn't file a missing persons
report on Stacy

14:46.318 --> 14:47.953
because she wasn't missing.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.955
As far as I knew,
she was on a solo trek

14:49.955 --> 14:52.491
up in Diablo working toward her NESTFs.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.493
NESTFs?

14:54.493 --> 14:55.093
Sorry.

14:55.093 --> 14:57.596
National
Extreme Sports Trainer Finals.

14:57.596 --> 14:59.798
I took mine last week. Did it in three days

14:59.798 --> 15:03.935
So, I didn't expect her back
for at least two more days.

15:03.935 --> 15:05.003
Okay.

15:05.003 --> 15:07.539
You mind if I have
a look around?

15:07.539 --> 15:09.841
No. Go ahead.

15:09.841 --> 15:11.433
Thanks.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.823
Detective.

16:10.368 --> 16:12.003
Check that out.

16:12.003 --> 16:13.605
You see that?

16:13.605 --> 16:15.073
Yeah.

16:15.073 --> 16:15.807
Mr. Hudson?

16:15.807 --> 16:19.678
You own this house with
Stacy Warner. Is that right?

16:19.678 --> 16:20.846
That's right.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.781
Any idea
how this blood got there?

16:26.551 --> 16:27.152
No.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.450
Stacy had a head trauma wound.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.157
You wouldn't know anything about that

16:32.157 --> 16:33.625
I'd never hurt Stacy.

16:33.625 --> 16:34.226
No?

16:34.226 --> 16:37.457
How do you explain
the domestic disturbance call

16:37.496 --> 16:39.464
to this address two weeks ago?

16:39.498 --> 16:41.600
We told the officers then
it was nothing.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.834
I don't know.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.803
The neighbor who
filed the complaint

16:44.803 --> 16:47.305
said you were really yelling
at Stacy.

16:47.305 --> 16:48.573
Said it sounded abusive.

16:48.573 --> 16:50.075
We're sports trainers.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.544
We say some crazy things
to get each other

16:52.544 --> 16:56.281
to do one more lap in the pool
or one more crunch.

16:56.281 --> 16:57.215
Are you a liar?!

16:57.215 --> 17:00.018
Or are you going
to give me more?!

17:00.018 --> 17:02.587
Are you weak?
Are you worthless?!

17:02.587 --> 17:05.190
Can you account for your
whereabouts this week?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.758
Big Sky Triathlon
in Montana.

17:06.758 --> 17:11.396
You want to see a picture
of me crossing the finish line?

17:11.396 --> 17:13.431
No. No.

17:13.431 --> 17:16.423
We got what we need.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.038
So I sent out some bulletins.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.607
Got a hit on Weston's
missing Mercedes.

17:22.607 --> 17:23.909
Sullivan called it in.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.443
He's a typical tow guy.

17:25.443 --> 17:26.933
I'll run him.

17:27.712 --> 17:30.048
Yeah, I got a call.

17:30.048 --> 17:33.285
"You want a wrecked S-class?"

17:33.285 --> 17:34.386
(chuckles)

17:34.386 --> 17:35.186
You betcha.

17:35.186 --> 17:38.519
The parts alone are worth
four, five times

17:38.557 --> 17:40.525
the Blue Book value
of the car.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.460
I asked, "Where
do I pick it up?" That's all I asked.

17:42.460 --> 17:43.628
You didn't ask his name?

17:43.628 --> 17:47.232
Someone throws you
300 thou in used parts,

17:47.232 --> 17:49.234
the only response
is, "Thank you very much."

17:49.234 --> 17:50.869
So where is the vehicle now?

17:50.869 --> 17:52.671
Look around.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.739
You work fast.

17:54.739 --> 17:57.537
Hey, I called it in. What moredo you want?

17:57.576 --> 18:01.535
Aristotle said something about the whole

18:01.880 --> 18:04.542
Of course, he never worked in a chop shop.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.552
We want all of the parts.

18:21.166 --> 18:24.533
Affirmative for blood...
passenger side.

18:26.237 --> 18:28.899
Well, that's just
a trace amount.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.567
Where's the rest of it?

18:30.609 --> 18:32.668
Want to pass me the luminol?

18:53.231 --> 18:56.401
Well, you do know
how to light up a room.

18:56.401 --> 18:59.070
Location of the blood
on the seats and the dash

18:59.070 --> 19:01.272
indicates
that the victim

19:01.272 --> 19:02.637
was inside the vehicle.

19:02.974 --> 19:05.602
Maybe the driver hit Bob Martin,

19:05.644 --> 19:07.879
stopped,
and put him in the front seat.

19:07.879 --> 19:08.913
Okay.

19:08.913 --> 19:10.915
Where did they go?

19:10.915 --> 19:13.251
Well, not to the emergency room.

19:13.251 --> 19:15.617
Not to Sunset Park
for48 hours.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.622
I'll swab
the rest
of the car...

19:17.656 --> 19:20.325
bring the samples
to Greg and have him run it against Bob

19:20.325 --> 19:24.162
If you find any blood
that isn't his, then...

19:24.162 --> 19:27.966
Maybe it belongs
to an injured joyrider,

19:27.966 --> 19:31.026
and we have a new suspect.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.450
The one day I'm due in court,

19:45.450 --> 19:48.253
and you pull a drowning
in the desert.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.154
How'd it go?

19:49.154 --> 19:49.988
Oh, it went great.

19:49.988 --> 19:53.591
The judge recessed right before my

19:53.591 --> 19:58.255
I'm on call. Catherine's on call.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.029
Boy, you're making progress.

20:01.066 --> 20:04.661
The blood from the poolside matches the

20:04.703 --> 20:07.372
Yeah. The problem is the small amount of

20:07.372 --> 20:08.707
isn't enough to prove anything,
you know?

20:08.707 --> 20:11.409
People bump their heads and scrape their

20:11.409 --> 20:12.077
Yeah.

20:12.077 --> 20:14.612
That musclehead
boyfriend...

20:14.612 --> 20:16.375
he's a little shady.

20:16.414 --> 20:18.116
He's hiding something.
I can feel it.

20:18.116 --> 20:18.983
Are you going to prove

20:18.983 --> 20:22.680
that he drowned her
in their swimming pool?

20:22.721 --> 20:24.689
Four samples:
One from their swimming pool,

20:24.723 --> 20:26.291
one from their bathroom,
one from Lake Mead

20:26.291 --> 20:28.384
and one from Clark County
Reservoir,

20:28.426 --> 20:31.062
but none are consistent
with the water I recovered from her

20:31.062 --> 20:32.689
What else did you collect
from the scene?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.966
Some rocks from under her body

20:34.966 --> 20:37.068
and a goose feather.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.403
A goose feather?

20:38.403 --> 20:41.139
This looks like basalt rock.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.408
Didn't it say somewhere in here

20:43.408 --> 20:46.211
that you found her
at 1,500 feet?

20:46.211 --> 20:47.579
The desert, yeah.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.447
Well, you can only find
this rock

20:49.447 --> 20:51.916
at high altitudes...
like 4,000 feet.

20:51.916 --> 20:53.218
Really?

20:53.218 --> 20:54.219
Yeah.

20:54.219 --> 20:54.853
You sure?

20:54.853 --> 20:58.556
Yeah. I went on this field trip
up at Table Mountain

20:58.556 --> 21:01.159
in my senior year...
"Rocks for Jocks."

21:01.159 --> 21:03.862
Don't ask me why
I remember any of this.

21:03.862 --> 21:04.562
Hey, that helps.

21:04.562 --> 21:06.865
I think I'm going
to head out there.

21:06.865 --> 21:07.632
You want to roll?

21:07.632 --> 21:09.801
You're on call at court,
right.

21:09.801 --> 21:12.837
All that blood belonged
to the victim.

21:12.837 --> 21:13.605
Look at this.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.608
Visible blood drops
under the passenger seat.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.544
That's a strange place
for blood.

21:19.544 --> 21:22.013
Radiated spatter.

21:22.013 --> 21:22.914
What do you think?

21:22.914 --> 21:25.083
Blood pooled
onto the floor mat.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.551
As more drops splashed down

21:26.551 --> 21:29.487
the impact projected
the blood drops upward.

21:29.487 --> 21:30.088
Okay.

21:30.088 --> 21:32.390
But where
did it fall from?

21:32.390 --> 21:34.793
So, Greg said you guys
are processing an S-class.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.795
Yeah, what's left of it.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.763
Now, that's a crime.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.598
Oh, this would have broken
my ex's heart.

21:40.598 --> 21:45.036
Every weekend the guy'd be
test-driving another Mercedes.

21:45.036 --> 21:46.571
I'd get myself all dressed up,

21:46.571 --> 21:50.809
make the dealer believe
we could actually afford it.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.178
Damn.

21:53.178 --> 21:54.712
If this car was stolen,

21:54.712 --> 21:56.915
the ignition lock would
be punched, right?

21:56.915 --> 21:57.982
Huh?

21:57.982 --> 22:01.782
Anyway, I got to go.
Warrick and I are due in court.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.481
Later.

22:03.988 --> 22:06.291
We... we would
have caught that.

22:06.291 --> 22:10.195
We were distracted
by what we were
looking for.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.729
Yeah.

22:11.729 --> 22:16.134
So how did the thief
turn the engine over

22:16.134 --> 22:19.103
without breaking
that lock?

22:19.103 --> 22:21.799
Maybe
there is no thief.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.809
All right, again.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.811
I ran into the Chinese restaurant.

22:26.845 --> 22:30.048
I wasn't in there
more than two minutes,

22:30.048 --> 22:32.951
but I left my keys
in the car.

22:32.951 --> 22:36.454
You left
an $80,000 Mercedes idling?

22:36.454 --> 22:37.922
Yeah.

22:37.922 --> 22:39.691
Stupid, right?

22:39.691 --> 22:41.726
That's why I didn't say anything.

22:41.726 --> 22:43.995
Besides,
if my insurance finds out,

22:43.995 --> 22:45.830
it's contributory negligence.

22:45.830 --> 22:46.865
Let's just cut to the chase.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.526
I told you everything.

22:48.566 --> 22:51.536
Chinese restaurant near my house. Couldn't

22:51.536 --> 22:53.538
Parked in the handicapped zone,
left the motor running.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.540
I wasn't in there
more than a minute.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.542
Take off your shirt, please.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.777
You're going to need a warrant,
like I said.

22:59.777 --> 23:01.212
But you don't
have basis.

23:01.212 --> 23:04.545
Actually, the issuing judge
disagrees.

23:07.218 --> 23:10.989
I can call Judge Scott,
contest your grounds.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.724
- But you won't -You want to refuse?

23:12.724 --> 23:15.426
One of us will remove it
for you.

23:15.426 --> 23:18.862
Yeah.

23:22.934 --> 23:24.526
Here you go.

23:26.404 --> 23:28.773
Look, no chemical burns.

23:28.773 --> 23:30.434
You satisfied?

23:33.745 --> 23:37.545
The warrant
is for the whole shirt.

23:38.316 --> 23:40.216
Yeah.

23:48.793 --> 23:50.762
You don't have
to be a scientist

23:50.762 --> 23:52.630
to know where that came from.

23:52.630 --> 23:53.564
(tires screeching)

23:53.564 --> 23:55.896
We got enough
for a hit-and-run.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.402
All right, hold on.

23:57.402 --> 23:58.836
It's not what you think.

23:58.836 --> 24:00.895
I called in my order.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.541
I looked down to put away
my phone.

24:03.541 --> 24:04.909
(bang)

24:04.909 --> 24:06.978
I hit something.

24:06.978 --> 24:09.347
I stopped. I looked around.

24:09.347 --> 24:10.949
I couldn't see anything.

24:10.949 --> 24:16.154
I figured it must have been
a dog, and it ran off.

24:16.154 --> 24:18.022
So I drove
to the restaurant,

24:18.022 --> 24:20.458
that's when
my car was stolen.

24:20.458 --> 24:23.728
It was
a rough night.

24:23.728 --> 24:25.363
Look, my car was stolen.

24:25.363 --> 24:28.466
What happened next,
I don't know.

24:28.466 --> 24:30.935
Save it.

24:30.935 --> 24:32.437
You're under arrest.

24:32.437 --> 24:34.735
All right.

24:43.114 --> 24:44.882
I hate lawyers.

24:44.882 --> 24:47.952
We need a warrant for his house.

24:47.952 --> 24:49.620
We need to find something
we can use

24:49.620 --> 24:51.884
to keep that creep off the street.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.496
(panting)

25:02.333 --> 25:04.469
I'm all for retracing
the girl's steps,

25:04.469 --> 25:07.005
but it wouldn't hurt
to bring in some cadets.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.308
If it was a little kid
or a mass casualty,

25:10.308 --> 25:13.044
maybe we'd get
that kind of manpower,

25:13.044 --> 25:16.980
but, hey, exercise is good
for us, right?

25:17.015 --> 25:20.118
Air feels thin to me.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.211
(grunting)

25:35.366 --> 25:37.391
Check it out.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.304
Let's go.

25:57.455 --> 26:00.792
You said the vic was wearing light layers of

26:00.792 --> 26:03.227
Yeah, several layers...
tempered cotton.

26:03.227 --> 26:06.831
This is a men's
extra large.

26:06.831 --> 26:08.032
This is
too big for her.

26:08.032 --> 26:14.038
Goose down like
I found on her body.

26:14.038 --> 26:15.801
What's this?

26:21.679 --> 26:27.118
Ah. Property of Mr. Muscles.

26:27.118 --> 26:28.085
You want to run it?

26:29.420 --> 26:34.092
Well, maybe he left
a day later than he said

26:34.092 --> 26:34.992
for his little marathon,
you know?

26:34.992 --> 26:37.728
Followed her out here,
started arguing with her,

26:37.728 --> 26:42.600
no neighbors around
to call the cops.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.601
(shrieks)

26:43.601 --> 26:45.069
She manages
to fight her way free,

26:45.069 --> 26:49.974
finds higher ground,
he follows her, takes her down.

26:49.974 --> 26:50.741
So then what?

26:50.741 --> 26:53.608
He drowns her
with canteen water?

26:54.312 --> 26:56.948
I'm going to let you
run that by the D.A.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.251
You should try describing
a scuba diver up in a tree, man.

27:00.251 --> 27:01.419
Up in a tree, man.

27:01.419 --> 27:02.987
This is nothing.

27:02.987 --> 27:06.390
No, the, uh... the evidence
tells the story.

27:06.390 --> 27:09.760
So why did a cagey guy like our suspect

27:09.760 --> 27:11.091
leave his jacket up here?

27:11.129 --> 27:13.097
Everybody thinks
they have a plan

27:13.131 --> 27:16.100
till things start
to go wrong.

27:16.467 --> 27:20.771
I gave Stacy my jacket
the morning she left for Diablo

27:20.771 --> 27:21.772
for night layering.

27:21.772 --> 27:24.408
Extreme hikers
can't carry bedrolls.

27:24.408 --> 27:25.943
That's what makes it extreme.

27:25.943 --> 27:30.114
And she just left
your jacket wedged
under some rocks.

27:30.114 --> 27:32.850
Maybe.
I don't know.

27:32.850 --> 27:36.988
Look, I gave it to her
to take care of her.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.390
I loved Stacy.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.993
Then help us out here, man.

27:41.993 --> 27:45.696
I've got prior disturbance calls,

27:45.696 --> 27:46.631
her blood in the pool, her body drowned

27:46.631 --> 27:50.401
in the middle of the desert
with your jacket nearby...

27:50.401 --> 27:52.069
your map.

27:52.069 --> 27:54.906
That's my trail map.
I'd like it back.

27:54.906 --> 27:58.376
No. No, it's evidence now.

27:58.376 --> 28:00.044
You can put a request in for it

28:00.044 --> 28:02.547
when we complete
our investigation, okay?

28:02.547 --> 28:04.248
Am I free to go?

28:04.248 --> 28:06.512
You're not under arrest.

28:14.058 --> 28:16.151
I'm getting this to QD.

28:16.194 --> 28:19.721
He doesn't want me to have this map, and I

28:26.804 --> 28:28.472
(sighs)

28:28.472 --> 28:29.574
He made bail.

28:29.574 --> 28:31.475
Yeah, that figures.

28:31.475 --> 28:32.476
Oh, I almost forgot.

28:32.476 --> 28:35.379
Here's a warrant
to search your premises.

28:35.379 --> 28:38.182
We'd like to start
in your garage.

28:38.182 --> 28:40.418
Yeah.

28:40.418 --> 28:44.222
Look, I'm filing a complaint
with your supervisor.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.690
You're harassing me.

28:45.690 --> 28:47.959
If you're a lawyer, you should know

28:47.959 --> 28:51.190
the legal definition of harassment.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.764
Investigating a crime doesn't quite fit the

28:53.764 --> 28:55.499
However, a false accusation
of harassment

28:55.499 --> 28:59.337
within earshot of my colleagues
could be construed as slander.

28:59.337 --> 29:00.338
I know the law, too,

29:00.338 --> 29:03.705
and I've actually
been in a courtroom.

29:24.996 --> 29:27.865
This was parked in
the driveway, wasn't it?

29:27.865 --> 29:29.734
Now that's a crime?

29:29.734 --> 29:33.004
Jim, could you get
this car moved for us?

29:33.004 --> 29:36.774
Unless the keys
are in the ignition, hand them over.

29:36.774 --> 29:40.044
It's a rental. You're not on my policy.

29:40.044 --> 29:42.346
Oh, I'm a safe driver.

29:42.346 --> 29:44.780
Wait outside.

30:02.099 --> 30:04.435
It smells like bleach to me.

30:04.435 --> 30:06.404
I'll check for blood.

30:06.404 --> 30:08.306
Why would he leave
his car outside

30:08.306 --> 30:12.376
with the sprinklers on
instead of putting it in here?

30:12.376 --> 30:15.277
Maybe the garage was full.

30:28.326 --> 30:31.028
What exactly do you want me to look

30:31.028 --> 30:33.998
Alterations, erasures,
paper content.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.296
The guy was really nervous about me

30:36.334 --> 30:38.302
Okay, I'll test the components in the inks

30:38.336 --> 30:40.137
and then bombard the paper with different

30:40.137 --> 30:41.172
We'll see what's up.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.406
Sounds good, man.

30:42.406 --> 30:44.742
- Thanks, man. - You bet.

30:44.742 --> 30:45.710
Hey, Grissom...

30:45.710 --> 30:46.944
Keep me posted.
I will.

30:46.944 --> 30:50.414
Did you take a look at that maggot from the

30:50.414 --> 30:51.415
Yes.

30:51.415 --> 30:51.949
And?

30:51.949 --> 30:54.151
Well, it belongs
to the family of sarcophagids.

30:54.151 --> 30:55.086
That's as far as I got.

30:55.086 --> 30:56.821
You mind taking
another look for me?

30:56.821 --> 30:59.423
Your maggot never
developed, Nick.

30:59.423 --> 31:00.624
It never will.

31:00.624 --> 31:01.258
Why?

31:01.258 --> 31:03.317
It happens to Sarcophagids

31:03.361 --> 31:06.330
when they're exposed to freezing

31:06.364 --> 31:08.332
So, my maggot was stunt ed?

31:08.366 --> 31:10.334
Probably
by frozen air.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.666
Yeah, but we found the vic in the desert.

31:12.703 --> 31:15.039
Well, maybe it was a very cold night.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.337
Mucho frio.

31:18.409 --> 31:21.776
Muchas gracias.

31:31.355 --> 31:33.789
Come on in, Greg.

31:38.362 --> 31:39.363
Hey.

31:39.363 --> 31:39.930
Hey.

31:39.930 --> 31:42.967
So, I heard about
your cold maggot.

31:42.967 --> 31:44.535
News travels fast.

31:44.535 --> 31:45.936
I was thinking...

31:45.936 --> 31:49.673
most people
figure Las Vegas
means "The Strip,"

31:49.673 --> 31:51.876
when it really means
"The Meadows."

31:51.876 --> 31:55.513
I'm trying to calculate
barometric pressure here, G.

31:55.513 --> 31:56.414
Well, my point is,

31:56.414 --> 31:58.883
Nevada is a
basin -and- range state.

31:58.883 --> 32:02.386
Down in the desert basin,
hardly any rain.

32:02.386 --> 32:04.588
But, up in the
mountain ranges,

32:04.588 --> 32:06.924
it's 40 inches a year.

32:06.924 --> 32:09.226
That's more than Seattle,

32:09.226 --> 32:11.762
it's more than San Francisco,
it's more than...

32:11.762 --> 32:13.389
Yeah, yeah. I see
where you're going.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.399
Last week, in Vegas,
perfect weather...

32:15.433 --> 32:18.402
warm, steady barometric
pressure, but...

32:18.436 --> 32:22.306
out in Diablo, two days before
I found Stacy Warner's body...

32:22.306 --> 32:24.900
The mountain
shadow effect.

32:31.949 --> 32:35.052
That's what
meteorologists call it.

32:35.052 --> 32:37.247
Right.

32:40.524 --> 32:41.692
This is Ecklie's Mercedes?

32:41.692 --> 32:45.529
Well, actually, I sold it to him five years ago.

32:45.529 --> 32:48.999
It was in much better condition back then.

32:48.999 --> 32:50.601
Hey.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.603
So I checked with Auto Detail.

32:52.603 --> 32:57.141
Uh... obviously, if you fill a car up with

32:57.141 --> 32:59.343
or, in our case, blood... it's going to leak
through the bottom.

32:59.343 --> 33:02.646
Dicing wounds with
glass were limited

33:02.646 --> 33:04.582
to the upper torso, right?

33:04.582 --> 33:07.117
Top of the head, face,
top of shoulders,

33:07.117 --> 33:07.885
and forearms.

33:07.885 --> 33:10.187
Which would be consistent
with a head-on crash.

33:10.187 --> 33:15.059
The head of the victim
crashed into the passenger side

33:15.059 --> 33:16.458
of the windshield.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.496
Well, this isn't
the same model or year,

33:18.496 --> 33:20.164
but it's
close enough.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.533
Okay, I'm thinking
that the car

33:22.533 --> 33:24.602
clipped the victim here,

33:24.602 --> 33:26.832
and he was catapulted...

33:27.805 --> 33:33.038
and he was positioned
something like this.

33:34.411 --> 33:37.815
(glass shattering)

33:37.815 --> 33:38.716
So now he's bleeding,

33:38.716 --> 33:41.651
and his blood is dripping
onto the mat.

33:45.856 --> 33:48.058
The victim bled out
for two days.

33:48.058 --> 33:51.295
Yeah, but he could
have been conscious, right?

33:51.295 --> 33:54.565
Until he lost a third of his circulating blood

33:54.565 --> 33:58.102
Then the hypovolemic shock
would have set in

33:58.102 --> 34:00.237
after approximately 12 hours.

34:00.237 --> 34:02.306
So it's possible
that he was wedged

34:02.306 --> 34:05.376
into the windshield
of Ben Weston's Mercedes,

34:05.376 --> 34:08.212
which was parked
in Ben Weston's garage.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.148
We know where Bob Martin was.

34:11.148 --> 34:13.350
Where was Ben Weston?

34:13.350 --> 34:15.185
My guess...

34:15.185 --> 34:19.246
At work,
making a good impression.

34:22.226 --> 34:27.357
Sometimes I'm glad
I only deal with dead people.

34:30.534 --> 34:32.525
You know...

34:32.570 --> 34:37.530
the tow truck driver said
Weston's Mercedes was totaled.

34:37.574 --> 34:40.578
But the only damage would have been to

34:40.578 --> 34:42.679
He's lying.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.349
Maybe it
wasn't totaled.

34:45.349 --> 34:47.451
I don't remember. I was only interested in

34:47.451 --> 34:49.853
You don't know
who phoned it in?

34:49.853 --> 34:53.489
It was a guy. What else can I tell you?

34:53.489 --> 34:55.926
Mr. Sullivan, in '96
you were arrested

34:55.926 --> 34:58.121
for vandalism, right?

34:58.596 --> 35:00.931
I was 18.
It was a prank.

35:00.931 --> 35:03.367
I hoisted the principal's
station wagon onto the roof of the gym.

35:03.367 --> 35:05.202
St. Ignacias High School, right?

35:05.202 --> 35:07.568
It's funny, but
the registered owner

35:07.605 --> 35:10.574
of the Mercedes
also went to St. Ignacias.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.576
You were in
the same class.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.579
Ben Weston.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.281
That might ring a bell. So what?

35:17.281 --> 35:18.849
He's been arrested on a hit-and-run.

35:18.849 --> 35:20.317
He's also under suspicion
for murder.

35:20.317 --> 35:23.787
That makes you an accomplice
after the fact... 20 to life.

35:23.787 --> 35:26.255
Okay, look, all I did

35:26.290 --> 35:29.953
was take his call, take his car. I don't even

35:29.994 --> 35:31.962
In high school,
he's the one
who turned me in.

35:31.962 --> 35:35.796
He said he wanted
to make it up to me.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.640
Just remind yourself

35:42.640 --> 35:45.632
that usually I bring
the case home.

35:46.043 --> 35:49.847
If that garage
floor stain
started out as blood,

35:49.847 --> 35:52.416
the bleach
just degraded it.

35:52.416 --> 35:53.884
There's nothing for me
to work with.

35:53.884 --> 35:55.052
Sorry.

35:55.052 --> 35:57.321
There goes the slam dunk.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.654
Blood in the garage would have

36:01.792 --> 36:04.261
So, is this
his rental car?

36:04.261 --> 36:07.628
Sunset Park is two miles
from Ben Weston's house.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.668
I was thinking maybe he used this car to

36:10.668 --> 36:13.570
So we should be able to find
some of the vic's blood

36:13.570 --> 36:15.973
or hair or fibers
from his clothes.

36:15.973 --> 36:18.635
No visible trace
of any kind.

36:19.977 --> 36:21.968
Except for this.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.353
So this mountain shadow effect...

36:29.353 --> 36:31.651
the barometric
pressure spikes down,

36:31.689 --> 36:33.457
the temperature
strikes down...

36:33.457 --> 36:34.651
Right. Humidity
spikes up.

36:34.692 --> 36:35.726
Moisture in the air
condenses.

36:35.726 --> 36:39.463
(thunder crashing)

36:39.463 --> 36:41.658
The mountains get
a flash flood.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.667
You know, I checked with
the National Weather Service.

36:43.701 --> 36:47.660
This area got three inches of rain in 20

36:48.706 --> 36:52.843
So, she was up here hiking
when the weather changed.

36:52.843 --> 36:54.678
Got nasty in a hurry.

36:54.678 --> 36:56.942
Nothing she could
really do about it.

36:57.948 --> 37:01.679
Then she takes one to the head... on the

37:01.719 --> 37:03.954
She's trying to clear the cobwebs when the

37:03.954 --> 37:06.684
(thunder rumbling)

37:18.736 --> 37:21.330
But it was too late.

37:24.241 --> 37:27.010
She drowns in the floodwater.

37:27.010 --> 37:31.582
Body gets carried
to the base of the canyon.

37:31.582 --> 37:34.151
A couple hours
worth of sun

37:34.151 --> 37:35.219
water dries up.

37:35.219 --> 37:38.388
No evidence
of the storm anywhere

37:38.388 --> 37:39.389
except on the vic,

37:39.389 --> 37:42.292
who carried traced amounts
of basalt rock with her,

37:42.292 --> 37:45.662
and rainwater
in her throat.

37:45.662 --> 37:49.800
(phone ringing)

37:49.800 --> 37:50.734
Stokes.

37:50.734 --> 37:53.504
The map has definitely
been tamper ed with.

37:53.504 --> 37:54.872
You sure about that?

37:54.872 --> 37:55.506
Positive.

37:55.506 --> 37:57.141
Chemical tag in the ink
tells the tale.

37:57.141 --> 38:00.310
Then I shot the map with
300 nanometers just to be sure.

38:00.310 --> 38:02.679
I need you to get
those results to me.

38:02.679 --> 38:03.881
Thought you would.

38:03.881 --> 38:05.616
I have a messenger on call.

38:05.616 --> 38:10.954
Are you telling me Stacy's death
was an accident?

38:10.954 --> 38:13.624
An accident of nature, yeah.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.859
But you still had
a hand in her death

38:15.859 --> 38:18.295
just the same,
didn't you, Mr. Hudson?

38:18.295 --> 38:20.464
What are you
talking about?

38:20.464 --> 38:22.533
Why don't you
take a break?

38:22.533 --> 38:25.661
Come on over here
for a sec.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.772
You altered the map.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.542
You used the same
color ink as the printer,

38:31.542 --> 38:33.772
but the chemical tag s
in the ink are different.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.802
This is Magic Marker.

38:37.147 --> 38:40.450
When you shine
ultraviolet light on it,

38:40.450 --> 38:41.285
like this...

38:41.285 --> 38:43.520
you can see exactly
what you did.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.123
You made this look like
an impenetrable ridge...

38:46.123 --> 38:49.493
no way out,
when it's actually a meadow.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.528
If she had a good map, she might have

38:51.528 --> 38:53.792
out of the highlands
by nightfall.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.800
I didn't want her to die.

38:57.835 --> 38:58.802
I didn't.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.804
Then why did you alter the map?

39:00.838 --> 39:02.806
We competed.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.799
I'd just run the trail in three days. I didn't want

39:08.045 --> 39:10.809
Am I being charged with murder?

39:12.049 --> 39:13.650
No.

39:13.650 --> 39:14.651
You altered the map,

39:14.651 --> 39:16.353
but you didn't make it rain.

39:16.353 --> 39:18.722
What you did isn't a crime...

39:18.722 --> 39:22.624
but it is criminal, isn't it?

39:27.097 --> 39:28.530
Come on.

39:28.866 --> 39:31.835
Your entire case
is circumstantial.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.871
Your physical evidence
is pathetic.

39:33.871 --> 39:36.173
You've got, what,
a wrecked car...

39:36.173 --> 39:39.176
a white powder
in a rental...

39:39.176 --> 39:41.838
and a bleached-out
stain in my garage.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.847
If that's
all you've got,

39:43.881 --> 39:46.714
you won't even
get a filing.

39:50.287 --> 39:52.522
My cell phone.

39:52.522 --> 39:53.056
Yeah.

39:53.056 --> 39:55.792
Mitchell Sullivan
found it in your car

39:55.792 --> 39:56.560
at his chop shop.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.796
I hope he didn't make
any long-distance calls.

39:59.796 --> 40:00.888
Thanks.

40:02.299 --> 40:04.563
It's evidence.

40:06.169 --> 40:07.871
Hey, now it's a party.

40:07.871 --> 40:10.965
And I brought the music.

40:11.241 --> 40:12.868
You'll be happy
to know

40:12.910 --> 40:14.878
that there were no long-distanced calls
made on your cell phone.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.880
But there was one call made...

40:16.880 --> 40:20.284
to 911... at 2:30 a.m.
On Tuesday morning,

40:20.284 --> 40:24.054
while your car was
still in your possession.

40:24.054 --> 40:27.991
911. What's your emergency?

40:27.991 --> 40:29.693
Please help me.

40:29.693 --> 40:33.497
I...I can't hear you, sir. You'll have to speak

40:33.497 --> 40:35.565
Please help me.

40:35.565 --> 40:37.534
Help...

40:37.534 --> 40:41.903
Sir, our system
is not compatible with your cellular phone.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.907
Where are you calling from?

40:44.942 --> 40:46.910
I'm in a garage.

40:46.944 --> 40:50.147
Sir, can you see a street sign?

40:50.147 --> 40:52.615
It's dark...

40:56.253 --> 40:57.521
Explain it to me, Ben.

40:57.521 --> 41:02.059
How does a lawyer rationalize
something like this?

41:02.059 --> 41:05.162
You know the law.

41:05.162 --> 41:06.697
You hit a guy.

41:06.697 --> 41:08.265
It was an accident.

41:08.265 --> 41:09.132
Nothing criminal.

41:09.132 --> 41:13.036
But you let it escalate
to first-degree murder.

41:13.036 --> 41:15.505
I spoke with your
senior partner.

41:15.505 --> 41:18.442
It was your first
day on the job.

41:18.442 --> 41:20.010
Big firm.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.311
Big welcome.

41:21.311 --> 41:24.314
How many drinks
did you have that night?

41:24.314 --> 41:26.783
Let me guess.

41:26.783 --> 41:29.886
You wanted the alcohol
to wear off

41:29.886 --> 41:31.945
before you called it in, right?

41:31.989 --> 41:33.957
So you decided
to wait it out.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.960
Have a cup of coffee, sober up, then call the

41:36.994 --> 41:41.761
But, unfortunately,
Bob Martin woke up.

41:43.767 --> 41:44.868
Help me.

41:44.868 --> 41:48.497
Please, help...
help me...

41:56.980 --> 41:59.676
So what do you do now, hmm?

42:00.017 --> 42:02.986
Can't walk into the
emergency room and say, "Hey
this guy was bleeding to death

42:03.020 --> 42:05.989
in my garage while I was eating
mu shu pork."

42:07.024 --> 42:08.992
Sara, there's someone
here to see you.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.357
Not right now.

42:10.427 --> 42:13.021
You'll want to talk to It's relevant.

42:24.408 --> 42:27.611
I sacrificed to get where I am.

42:27.611 --> 42:31.448
My whole life
was leading up
to last Monday.

42:31.448 --> 42:34.351
Yeah. It's tough, huh?

42:34.351 --> 42:37.421
Fifteen years
to build your dream,

42:37.421 --> 42:40.590
and a 15-second phone call
destroys it.

42:40.590 --> 42:42.659
Where did
you find this?

42:42.659 --> 42:44.961
Packing up
Bob's stuff.

42:44.961 --> 42:46.430
Found it
on his dresser.

42:46.430 --> 42:48.698
Thought you'd
want to see it.

42:48.698 --> 42:50.723
Thanks.

43:12.489 --> 43:14.391
When a driver hits a pedestrian,

43:14.391 --> 43:16.960
the presumption is
the driver is negligent.

43:16.960 --> 43:20.054
When a driver's been drinking
and he hits a pedestrian,

43:20.097 --> 43:22.766
it's no longer negligence... it's reckless

43:22.766 --> 43:26.002
But when a pedestrian
intentionally throws himself

43:26.002 --> 43:27.070
in front of a moving vehicle,

43:27.070 --> 43:28.972
then the driver's
no longer responsible.

43:28.972 --> 43:33.076
Legally, he's off the hook.

43:33.076 --> 43:36.379
This suicide letter
was written by Bob Martin

43:36.379 --> 43:37.681
to his wife Charlotte

43:37.681 --> 43:40.517
When you hit him
Monday night,

43:40.517 --> 43:43.145
it wasn't an accident.

43:53.430 --> 43:56.533
You were
off the hook.

43:56.533 --> 43:59.900
Until you let him die.
