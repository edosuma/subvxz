WEBVTT

00:09.410 --> 00:10.878
- LIFE--IT'S LITERALLY
ALL WE HAVE.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.246
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:12.280 --> 00:13.714
I'M A REVIEWER,
BUT I DON'T REVIEW

00:13.747 --> 00:15.916
FOOD, BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.985
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.920
VIVA THE REVOLUTION!

00:19.953 --> 00:23.191
[crowd cheering]

00:23.224 --> 00:25.426
[Taser crackling]
AGH!

00:25.459 --> 00:28.429
[triumphant fanfare]

00:28.462 --> 00:32.433
*

00:32.466 --> 00:34.702
HELLO,
AND WELCOME TO REVIEW.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.770
I'M FORREST MACNEIL,
AND AS ALWAYS,

00:36.804 --> 00:39.207
I WILL REVIEW ANY EXPERIENCE
YOU WANT ME TO,

00:39.240 --> 00:40.541
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.009
- YOU READY, FORREST?
- YES, I AM.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.511
- OKAY.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.613
THIS COMES FROM NICK
IN SYOSSET, NEW YORK.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.880
- AHA.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.282
- HEY, FORREST.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.518
SO, ON THE BACK OF THIS BOX
OF PANCAKE MIX,

00:50.551 --> 00:52.953
THEY TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE
15 PANCAKES,

00:52.986 --> 00:55.523
BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU
HOW TO MAKE ANY FEWER THAN THAT.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.058
SO HERE'S THE THING--
I LIVE ALONE.

00:58.092 --> 01:01.129
DO THEY EXPECT ME
TO EAT 15 PANCAKES?

01:01.162 --> 01:04.932
WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO EAT 15 PANCAKES?

01:04.965 --> 01:07.000
- NO. REALLY?

01:07.034 --> 01:08.602
THAT'S THE, UH--

01:08.636 --> 01:10.304
THAT'S THE PROFOUND
LIFE EXPERIENCE

01:10.338 --> 01:12.273
HE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT--
EATING 15 PANCAKES?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.508
- THAT'S HIS REQUEST, SO...

01:14.542 --> 01:17.445
- YES, THAT IS...
[clears throat]

01:17.478 --> 01:18.846
THE REQUEST
THAT HAS BEEN MADE.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.514
OKAY, NICK,

01:20.548 --> 01:22.350
I'M GOING TO COVER YOUR REQUEST
IN BUTTER AND SYRUP

01:22.383 --> 01:24.852
AND DIG IN TO TRY TO FIND
SOME IMPORTANT MEANING

01:24.885 --> 01:29.190
IN A GIANT, STEAMING PILE
OF FLAPJACKS.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.492
EATING 15 PANCAKES.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.827
- YUM.
- AHH.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.496
THOUGH THIS TASK
WAS CLEARLY MORE SUITED

01:35.529 --> 01:37.798
TO A FRATERNITY BROTHER
WHO HAD LOST A BET

01:37.831 --> 01:39.200
THAN TO A LIFE REVIEWER,

01:39.233 --> 01:41.335
I PREPARED MY STOMACH
AND MY NERVES

01:41.369 --> 01:44.838
FOR A VERY LARGE BREAKFAST.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.874
THE WORLD RECORD
FOR PANCAKES EATEN

01:46.907 --> 01:50.411
IN ONE SITTING
IS 73 PANCAKES.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.845
THAT IS HELD
BY A RUSSIAN MAN

01:51.879 --> 01:54.582
WHOSE LIFE MUST BE
AN UNENDURABLE HELLSCAPE

01:54.615 --> 01:56.717
OF EXCRUCIATING SADNESS.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.419
PERSONALLY, I DOUBT
I'VE EVER HAD

01:58.452 --> 02:00.221
MORE THAN TWO PANCAKES
IN A MONTH.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.191
- OKAY, FIVE TALL STACKS
OF PANCAKES.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.892
- YES.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.660
- THEY SAY BACK IN THE KITCHEN
IF YOU CAN FINISH IT ALL,

02:06.694 --> 02:08.229
WE'LL PUT YOUR PICTURE
UP ON THE WALL.

02:08.262 --> 02:11.599
- MM, NO, I DON'T THINK SO,
BUT THANK YOU.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.100
MAY I HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
OF WATER, PLEASE?

02:13.201 --> 02:15.469
- YOU GOT IT.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

02:15.503 --> 02:19.640
THIS CERTAINLY IS
AN UPSETTING NUMBER OF PANCAKES.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.074
HERE WE GO.

02:21.108 --> 02:24.077
[dramatic music]

02:24.111 --> 02:26.680
*

02:26.714 --> 02:28.516
THEY'RE TASTY...

02:28.549 --> 02:30.351
FOR NOW.

02:30.384 --> 02:34.455
*

02:34.488 --> 02:36.457
THREE PANCAKES IN,
AND I ALREADY FEEL

02:36.490 --> 02:39.660
THAT I HAVE
GREATLY OVERINDULGED.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.929
I AM FULL OF PANCAKES.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.598
ANY RATIONAL PERSON
FEELING THE WAY I DO NOW

02:44.632 --> 02:46.500
WOULD DEFINITELY STOP.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.536
[chuckles]

02:51.071 --> 02:58.379
*

02:58.412 --> 03:01.882
THERE'S A VERY LOUD THRUMMING
IN MY EARS.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.587
THE BLOOD FEELS VERY SLOW.

03:08.055 --> 03:10.924
OH, GOD.

03:10.958 --> 03:14.695
I HAVE NOW EATEN
TEN PANCAKES,

03:14.728 --> 03:17.631
AND ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
I CAN SEE THE LIGHT

03:17.665 --> 03:21.569
AT THE END OF THIS
DISGUSTING TUNNEL, BUT...

03:21.602 --> 03:24.638
IT HAS NOW BEEN 45 MINUTES

03:24.672 --> 03:25.906
SINCE I STARTED EATING,

03:25.939 --> 03:30.744
AND THE PANCAKES
ARE NO LONGER HOT.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.580
THESE AREN'T FOOD.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.892
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE, BABY.

03:44.925 --> 03:48.396
- WITH 1 1/2 PANCAKES TO GO,
I HAD HIT A WALL.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.898
MY PRODUCER, GRANT,
MADE THE UNPRECEDENTED MOVE

03:50.931 --> 03:52.800
OF STEPPING OUT
FROM BEHIND THE CAMERAS

03:52.833 --> 03:55.769
TO PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED
MORAL SUPPORT.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.839
- HEY, YOU KNOW YOU GOT
TO FINISH THESE PANCAKES, RIGHT?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.574
- YEAH.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.389
- YOU DO, MAN.
- MM.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.591
- THIS IS YOUR SHOW.
DON'T BAIL ON IT.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.992
- GO AWAY, PLEASE.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.528
- I'M JUST DOING
WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO.

04:20.561 --> 04:21.929
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
BACK DOWN.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.831
REMEMBER?

04:23.864 --> 04:27.000
"EVEN IF I BEG TO STOP,
DON'T LET ME."

04:27.034 --> 04:28.235
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

04:28.336 --> 04:31.238
- THIS ONE IS REALLY STUPID.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.349
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU TOLD ME

04:41.349 --> 04:43.050
ABOUT THE GUY
WHO SPENT ALL HIS TIME

04:43.083 --> 04:45.586
GROWING FUNGUS ON A STICK?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.021
AND EVERYBODY TOLD HIM
TO KNOCK IT OFF,

04:48.055 --> 04:49.423
AND HE WAS GONNA,

04:49.457 --> 04:51.091
UNTIL IT TURNED OUT
TO BE PENICILLIN.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.693
- MM-HMM.

04:52.726 --> 04:56.464
- THIS COULD BE
YOUR PENICILLIN, FORREST.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.500
- [sighs]

05:08.542 --> 05:11.512
[suspenseful music]

05:11.545 --> 05:19.553
*

05:27.995 --> 05:29.397
[laughter,
cheers, and applause]

05:29.430 --> 05:31.899
- YOU DID IT.
YOU DID IT!

05:31.932 --> 05:35.469
[laughing]

05:35.503 --> 05:38.506
OKAY, I'LL TAKE THIS
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.145
- AS I LEFT THE RESTAURANT,

05:45.178 --> 05:47.748
I SCANNED MY SOUL
FOR SOME GREATER WISDOM

05:47.781 --> 05:49.517
TO SHARE WITH HUMANITY.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.785
[heaving]

05:56.790 --> 05:58.526
[spits]
UGH.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.261
[groaning softly]

06:07.868 --> 06:09.136
YEAH, THERE'S NOT REALLY

06:09.169 --> 06:10.804
A WHOLE LOT MORE
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.506
IT WAS EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT
AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED

06:12.540 --> 06:13.974
AT ALL COSTS.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.910
EATING 15 PANCAKES--
HALF A STAR.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.746
ALL RIGHT, A.J.,
I HOPE MY NEXT REVIEW

06:18.779 --> 06:21.314
IS A LITTLE MORE SUBSTANTIAL
THAN MY LAST ONE.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.584
- WE'LL SEE.
- YEAH.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.352
- OKAY, THIS COMES
FROM LADYTARA

06:25.453 --> 06:26.754
IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.188
- AH.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.191
- HELLO. WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO GET A DIVORCE?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.494
- OH, NO.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.500
- WHAT'S IT LIKE TO, UH...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.336
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO--

06:43.370 --> 06:46.540
TO GET DIVORCED?
[clears throat]

06:51.679 --> 06:53.781
UH...

06:53.814 --> 06:57.150
THIS REVIEW WOULD INDEED
BE SUBSTANTIAL.

06:57.184 --> 07:02.022
ENDING MY MARRIAGE WAS BY FAR
MY WEIGHTIEST REVIEW YET.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.793
THIS WOULD TEST THE LIMITS
OF PERSONAL SACRIFICE.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.999
- SUZANNE AND I HAVE ENJOYED

07:12.032 --> 07:14.201
THE MOST LOVING,
FUNCTIONAL MARRIAGE

07:14.234 --> 07:15.669
IN MACNEIL FAMILY HISTORY.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.571
- I JUST WANT TO DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.873
- AND THOUGH WE HAD
OUR ARGUMENTS, WE ALWAYS MANAGED

07:19.907 --> 07:22.510
TO WORK THINGS OUT.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.877
WAS ALL THAT
REALLY GOING TO END?

07:23.911 --> 07:25.546
- NO!
- WHOO!

07:25.579 --> 07:29.049
- BEFORE UNDOING 14 YEARS
WITH THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

07:29.082 --> 07:32.352
I NEEDED TO REVIEW THE TERMS
OF THIS EXERCISE.

07:32.385 --> 07:36.524
WHAT IF I, LIKE,
JUST MARRIED SOMEONE ELSE

07:36.557 --> 07:38.526
FOR A DAY OR A WEEK
OR WHATEVER

07:38.526 --> 07:41.729
AND THEN JUST DIVORCED
THAT PERSON,

07:41.762 --> 07:43.096
YOU KNOW...

07:43.130 --> 07:45.733
- WELL, LOOK,
IF YOU WANT IDEAS

07:45.766 --> 07:47.701
FOR EASY WAYS
OUT OF THINGS,

07:47.735 --> 07:49.369
YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.138
BUT THIS ISN'T
ABOUT FINDING LOOPHOLES.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.875
THIS IS ABOUT COMMITTING
TO THE STANDARD THAT YOU SET.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.210
[phone ringing]

07:57.244 --> 08:00.380
"EVEN IF I BEG FOR HELP...

08:00.548 --> 08:02.550
DON'T LET ME OUT,"
RIGHT?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.317
- YEAH.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.554
- WHO SAID THAT?

08:06.587 --> 08:07.988
- [whispering]
I DID.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.557
[normal voice]
YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.793
IT SEEMED THAT TO HONOR
MY COMMITMENT TO THIS SHOW,

08:12.826 --> 08:15.395
I WOULD HAVE TO REND
MY FAMILY IN TWO.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.431
THERE WAS NO WAY AROUND IT.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.970
- HI.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.206
- [sighs]

08:26.239 --> 08:27.708
PFFFT.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.677
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TALK
WITH YOU ABOUT.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.579
- OKAY.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.918
- I WANT A DIVORCE.
- [laughs]

08:37.951 --> 08:40.654
HA HA.
GOOD ONE, FORREST.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.156
[chuckles]

08:43.190 --> 08:44.592
- [sighs]

08:44.592 --> 08:47.595
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE ROOT-BEER FLOATS?

08:51.599 --> 08:53.667
FORREST?
- I'M NOT JOKING.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.135
- WHAT?

09:01.341 --> 09:04.411
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I'M DIVORCING YOU.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.914
[sighs] I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW TERRIBLE IT FEELS.

09:06.947 --> 09:11.451
- WAIT, WHY?
WHY--WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

09:11.484 --> 09:13.453
[breathing heavily]
OKAY.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.322
- WHY NOT?
- WHY NOT?

09:15.355 --> 09:16.957
- YEAH.
- FORREST, THINGS HAVE BEEN

09:16.990 --> 09:18.458
JUST AS GOOD BETWEEN US
AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.927
- WELL, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
TO BE SAID

09:19.960 --> 09:21.261
FOR GOING OUT
ON A HIGH NOTE, YOU KNOW?

09:21.294 --> 09:22.963
- A HIGH NOTE?
- UH...

09:22.996 --> 09:24.698
- OKAY, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE?

09:24.732 --> 09:26.166
- NO, I'M NOT SEEING--
I'M REALLY NOT.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.935
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU
THAT I WAS.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.638
- OKAY, WELL, THEN IS IT
A MIDLIFE CRISIS OR SOMETHING?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.005
'CAUSE WE COULD WORK ON IT
TOGETHER.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.473
- [groaning]
- I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.042
- WHY DOES THERE HAVE TO BE
A REASON?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.977
- WHY--WHAT--THERE HAS TO BE
A REASON, FORREST.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.813
- STOP LOOKING FOR A REASON!

09:39.847 --> 09:41.815
WE HAVE TO GET DIVORCED!

09:41.849 --> 09:43.050
- WHY?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.654
- ENOUGH OF BEING MARRIED!

09:46.687 --> 09:48.856
I KNOW THIS IS VERY HARD.
THIS IS REALLY HARD.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.724
THIS IS A LOT HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.525
- [crying] YOU DON'T LOVE ME.
- NO, LISTEN, I REALLY DO.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.027
- THAT'S IT. YOU DON'T LOVE ME.
- NO, I REALLY DO.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.495
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU.
- OH, MY GOD, ERIC.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.231
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT ERIC?
- AH, YEAH.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.700
[groans]

09:59.733 --> 10:01.802
[huffs and puffs]

10:01.835 --> 10:03.070
HE IS NOT GONNA LIKE THIS.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.972
- HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE IT?

10:05.005 --> 10:06.674
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?
HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE IT?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.408
- OW! OW, OW, OW, OW!
- OKAY.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.210
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
PEOPLE GET DIVORCED ALL THE T--

10:10.243 --> 10:11.578
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

10:11.611 --> 10:14.181
YOU ARE GONNA DIE ALONE!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.582
I LOVED YOU MORE THAN ANYONE
WOULD LOVE YOU!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.317
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE WEIRD!

10:17.350 --> 10:19.386
SO GET OUT OF HERE.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.054
- WELL, I THOUGHT
I WOULD SLEEP ON THE COUCH.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.823
DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S
ANY CLEAN SINGLE SHEETS?

10:22.856 --> 10:25.025
- I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.164
[sentimental music]

10:31.198 --> 10:34.101
- MY SUDDEN SINGLEHOOD
LANDED ON ME

10:34.134 --> 10:36.870
LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.541
I WAS, IN A WORD,
COMPLETELY DEVASTATED.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.044
OH!
[thud]

10:44.077 --> 10:46.546
[metal clatters]

10:46.579 --> 10:51.584
*

10:51.618 --> 10:53.553
AND I WOULD SPEND
MY FIRST NIGHT ALONE

10:53.586 --> 10:56.623
IN THE COLD EMBRACE
OF THE JOB

10:56.656 --> 10:59.927
THAT HAD DESTROYED
MY MARRIAGE.

10:59.960 --> 11:06.033
*

11:08.235 --> 11:10.103
- OH, HEY!
- [groans]

11:10.137 --> 11:13.106
- JOSH, WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING
IN MY OFFICE?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.275
- 'CAUSE YOU PAY ME
IN COLLEGE CREDITS.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.177
CAN YOU TURN OFF THE LIGHT?
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.379
- YOU SLEEP HERE EVERY NIGHT?
- YEAH.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.281
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING THAT?

11:21.314 --> 11:22.549
- SINCE THE BEGINNING.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.151
THAT'S WHY I TOOK
THE INTERNSHIP.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.019
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
A SECURITY GUARD.

11:26.053 --> 11:29.189
- [sighs]

11:29.222 --> 11:32.459
I HAVE TO HAVE MEETINGS
ON THAT COUCH.

11:32.492 --> 11:35.162
THAT'S A--
THAT'S A WORK COUCH.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.265
- CLOSE THE DOOR!
- OH, GOD.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.069
DEPRIVED OF THE COMFORTS
OF MARRIED LIFE,

11:42.102 --> 11:44.772
A DIVORCED MAN MIGHT FIND
HIMSELF EXPERIENCING

11:44.772 --> 11:46.840
SOMETHING LIKE LONELINESS--

11:46.874 --> 11:48.641
DESPERATE LONELINESS.

11:48.675 --> 11:52.780
[sobbing]

11:52.780 --> 11:55.883
- HEY, MR. MACNEIL...

11:55.916 --> 11:58.919
IS GETTING OLDER
REALLY THAT SAD?

12:05.125 --> 12:08.095
[somber music]

12:08.128 --> 12:10.263
*

12:10.297 --> 12:12.699
- WITHOUT SUZANNE,
EVERY ASPECT OF MY DAILY LIFE

12:12.800 --> 12:14.902
WAS NUMBED BY SADNESS,

12:14.935 --> 12:17.570
WHICH IS AMONG THE WORST
OF OUR EMOTIONS

12:17.604 --> 12:19.239
AND ONE OF THE SADDEST.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.942
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH! OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

12:21.975 --> 12:25.578
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WERE...
DIFFICULT.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.247
SEEING PEOPLE TOGETHER

12:27.280 --> 12:30.818
REMINDED ME
THAT I WAS NOT TOGETHER.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.453
LOVE SONGS BECAME UNBEARABLE.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.823
- * LICK IT TIGHT NOW,
DO IT, BOY *

12:35.823 --> 12:37.324
* LICK IT UP AND DOWN

12:37.357 --> 12:39.226
* SUCK IT, LICK IT,
LICK IT TIGHT NOW *

12:39.259 --> 12:41.895
- SUZANNE!
[sobs]

12:41.929 --> 12:44.497
AND THEN SUZANNE REQUESTED
A MEETING.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.167
I CONCLUDED THAT SHE WAS GOING
TO ASK ME TO RECONCILE,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.469
AND I DID NOT KNOW
IF I'D HAVE THE STRENGTH

12:49.502 --> 12:52.605
TO RESIST.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.174
- HI, FORREST.
- HI.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.575
- COME ON IN.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.510
- YEAH, I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU CALLED.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.847
- HEY, I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY LAWYER, MARK.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.314
- OH.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.850
- FORREST, IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.084
- HELLO.
- HOW ARE YOU?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.652
- OKAY.
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

13:05.685 --> 13:08.088
- WELL, SIT, SIT, SIT.
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.923
- UH...

13:09.957 --> 13:11.591
NO.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.694
OKAY.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.229
- [sighs]

13:16.263 --> 13:20.033
LISTEN, YOU REALLY SURPRISED ME
WITH ALL OF THIS,

13:20.067 --> 13:22.502
BUT THE MORE
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

13:22.535 --> 13:24.905
THE MORE I REALIZED,

13:24.938 --> 13:26.239
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT."

13:26.273 --> 13:27.574
- OH.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.110
- WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING
EACH OTHER BACK.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.179
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
ALL I'VE EVER DONE FOR YOU

13:32.212 --> 13:35.715
IS JUST REASSURED YOU
THROUGH YOUR MANY INSECURITIES.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.417
- YEAH.
- "AM I LOSING MY HAIR?"

13:37.450 --> 13:39.619
YOU KNOW,
"DO MY BANGS LOOK THINNER?"

13:39.652 --> 13:41.421
- I KNOW.
- "I'M SORRY--THIS DIDN'T SEEM

13:41.454 --> 13:42.789
TO WORK TONIGHT."
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.892
- "MAYBE WE CAN TRY AGAIN
ON THE WEEKEND."

13:44.925 --> 13:46.126
- YEP, YEP, YEP.
- YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.394
ALL OF THAT,
AND I DON'T HAVE

13:47.427 --> 13:48.962
ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS,

13:48.996 --> 13:51.064
BUT A REAL STRONG PERSON
WOULD HAVE SAID,

13:51.098 --> 13:52.933
"HEY, FACE THEM."

13:52.966 --> 13:55.302
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
JUST SO CONTENT

13:55.335 --> 13:56.937
WITH WHO I AM,

13:56.970 --> 13:59.472
YOU'VE LOST INTEREST
WITH THE PERSON

13:59.506 --> 14:01.508
I WANT TO BECOME.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.775
- SHE'S ALREADY LEARNING
HOW TO SURF.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.611
- [chuckles]
- I JUST--

14:04.644 --> 14:06.713
I'M NOT GOOD YET.
- NO, SHE'S FANTASTIC.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.015
- WHAT IS THIS?
HELLO OR GOOD-BYE OR--

14:08.048 --> 14:09.316
- HANG LOOSE, YEAH.
- OKAY.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.550
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER

14:10.583 --> 14:11.919
IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.120
- THAT'S GREAT.
IT'S GREAT NEWS.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.354
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY...
- GOOD.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.956
- BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
OBVIOUSLY,

14:15.989 --> 14:17.490
FOR ME TO FEEL LIKE
WE HAD TO END THE MARRIAGE

14:17.524 --> 14:19.792
AND FOR YOU TO THEN
NOT FEEL THE SAME WAY--

14:19.826 --> 14:21.028
- OH.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.130
- YEAH, THAT WOULD BE JUST...

14:23.163 --> 14:24.364
both:
DEVASTATING.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.933
- EXACTLY.
- YEAH.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.634
- YEAH.
- GOD, THIS IS GREAT.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.069
- GREAT.
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:29.102 --> 14:31.204
BEFORE YOU GO,
MARK HAS JUST PREPARED

14:31.238 --> 14:32.672
SOME DOCUMENTS FOR YOU.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.174
- MM.
- IT BASICALLY JUST SAYS

14:34.207 --> 14:35.542
THAT YOU AGREE
TO UNCONTESTED MEDIATION.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.809
- SURE.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.211
- LOOK THROUGH IT
AT YOUR LEISURE.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.947
- NAH.
- NO CRAZY RUSH.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.348
- GO AHEAD AND SIGN IT
RIGHT NOW.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.682
- OKAY.
- WOW.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.218
IT SHOWS A LOT OF CARE
FOR WHAT YOU HAD

14:45.252 --> 14:47.320
TO LET PEOPLE BE FREE
FOR THE FUTURE.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.689
- THANK YOU
FOR YOUR INSIGHT.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.592
WELL, UH, I G--YEAH.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.994
I'M GONNA GO.
- OKAY.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.563
- THANKS.
- IT WAS GREAT SEEING YOU.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.832
- YEAH, UH...

14:59.866 --> 15:01.969
- WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?
OKAY.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.303
- OH.
- HMM.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.005
- NO, I...

15:05.038 --> 15:08.041
UH...

15:12.379 --> 15:13.780
- DO YOU NEED HELP?
IS IT LOCKED OR--

15:13.813 --> 15:15.082
- NO, NO, I GOT IT.
THANKS.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.117
- OKAY.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.351
- [clicks tongue]

15:18.385 --> 15:19.619
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.522
- TAKE CARE.
- YEAH. YEAH.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.624
[moaning, flesh slapping]

15:24.657 --> 15:26.626
- OH, MY GOD.
- [moaning]

15:26.659 --> 15:27.995
- OH, MY GOD.
- YEAH.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.262
- WAIT, SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.
- OH.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.497
- UGH!
- NO.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.765
- OKAY, OKAY--
OH, OH!

15:32.799 --> 15:34.501
[glass shatters]
OH, OH.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.536
[laughs]

15:44.477 --> 15:46.379
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:46.413 --> 15:48.648
- DO YOU HAVE A CONDOM?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.218
- NO.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.054
- OKAY. OKAY, SORRY.
GO BACK TO BED.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.322
- [sighs]

15:55.355 --> 15:58.191
- WANT ME TO JUST
EAT YOU OUT?

15:58.225 --> 16:00.027
- [sobbing]

16:00.027 --> 16:03.063
DIVORCE--A BIG DEAL.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.797
ON THE ONE HAND,
I'VE LOST THE PERSON

16:04.831 --> 16:07.934
WITH WHOM I PLANNED TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.769
ON THE OTHER HAND,
I WOULD NOT HAVE LEARNED

16:09.802 --> 16:11.738
OF HER FUNDAMENTAL UNHAPPINESS

16:11.771 --> 16:15.075
HAD I NOT
DIVORCED HER.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.044
SO THAT'S A--

16:17.077 --> 16:19.579
THAT'S A--
THAT'S A PLUS.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.715
DIVORCE, THEREFORE, GETS...

16:22.749 --> 16:25.718
[sentimental music]

16:25.752 --> 16:28.055
*

16:32.825 --> 16:36.063
[triumphant fanfare]

16:36.063 --> 16:39.066
- [laughing]

16:41.068 --> 16:43.336
WHAT IS MY NEXT REVIEW?

16:43.370 --> 16:45.072
- OKAY--
- I JUST GOT DIVORCED

16:45.072 --> 16:46.373
FOR THIS SHOW.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.707
I DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

16:47.740 --> 16:51.611
- OKAY, NEXT IS
FROM @CHRISTYLAPLANT

16:51.644 --> 16:52.845
IN AUGUSTA, GEORGIA.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.281
- BEAUTIFUL TOWN.
- YEP.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.483
SHE WANTS TO KNOW...

17:02.155 --> 17:04.091
- 30 PANCAKES?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.126
- YEP.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.229
- THIS IS A DIFFERENT PERSON
FROM THE 15-PANCAKE PERSON?

17:09.262 --> 17:11.864
- YEP.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.834
- IT'S TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
- YEAH. YEP.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.606
- THAT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.211
HERE WE ARE.
- YEP.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.113
- WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO EAT 30 PANCAKES?

17:26.113 --> 17:27.714
- MM-HMM.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.382
- YEAH.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.484
- GO, FORREST!
GO, FORREST, GO!

17:31.518 --> 17:32.752
GO, GO!

17:32.785 --> 17:34.321
- IT WOULD BE CHALLENGING

17:34.354 --> 17:36.323
TO FIND MEANING
IN ANY LIFE EXPERIENCE

17:36.356 --> 17:38.158
NOW THAT MY LIFE
HAD NO MEANING.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.127
ALSO, I HATE THAT KID
IN THE GLASSES,

17:40.127 --> 17:43.130
AND AUGUSTA, GEORGIA,
IS A [bleep]HOLE.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.500
THE IDEA OF EATING
TWICE THE NUMBER OF PANCAKES

17:47.534 --> 17:49.836
THAT LAID ME
SO LOW LAST TIME

17:49.869 --> 17:52.839
SHOULD HAVE FILLED ME
WITH A SENSE OF DREAD OR FEAR,

17:52.872 --> 17:54.474
BUT I FELT NOTHING.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.644
I GREETED THE PROSPECT
OF ALL THIS PAN-FRIED DOUGH

17:57.677 --> 18:00.313
WITH ONLY A VAST,
EMPTY NUMBNESS.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.515
- HEY, IT'S MR. PANCAKES!

18:02.549 --> 18:04.651
- BRING ME TEN TALL STACKS
OF PANCAKES.

18:04.684 --> 18:09.389
- WHAT?
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.857
OH, MY GOD.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.760
HEY, FILIPE, GUESS WHAT!

18:13.793 --> 18:17.364
[chuckling]

18:24.937 --> 18:27.907
[foreboding music]

18:27.940 --> 18:35.948
*

18:37.584 --> 18:41.053
- AND THEN, FROM SOMEWHERE DEEP
AND PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN,

18:41.087 --> 18:44.791
THERE SPRANG A RESERVE
OF FORTITUDE AND COURAGE.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.794
[dramatic music]

18:47.827 --> 18:49.729
*

18:49.762 --> 18:51.864
OR WAS IT RESIGNATION...

18:51.898 --> 18:53.700
OR FATALISM...

18:53.733 --> 18:55.635
OR NIHILISM?

18:55.668 --> 19:03.743
*

19:09.816 --> 19:12.018
OR PERHAPS
I SIMPLY UNDERSTOOD,

19:12.051 --> 19:14.354
FROM THE DARKEST CORNER
OF MY SOUL,

19:14.387 --> 19:17.457
THAT THESE PANCAKES
COULDN'T KILL ME

19:17.490 --> 19:19.526
BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY DEAD.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.034
- THAT'S MY BOY.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.370
ALL RIGHT.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.406
- [vomiting]

19:40.747 --> 19:43.716
[spits]
UGH.

19:43.750 --> 19:47.387
[spits]
UGH. MM.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.100
FOLKS, I HAVE NO MORE DESIRE

20:01.268 --> 20:02.935
TO GET THROUGH
THE REST OF MY LIFE

20:02.969 --> 20:05.104
THAN I DID
TO EAT THOSE PANCAKES.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.740
[vomits]

20:07.774 --> 20:09.175
BUT I ATE THEM.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.910
AND THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT I CAN KEEP GOING

20:10.943 --> 20:13.713
WHEN ALL SEEMS LOST--

20:13.746 --> 20:15.615
THAT'S A GREAT THING
TO ACQUIRE.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.784
EATING 30 PANCAKES--

20:17.817 --> 20:20.720
FIVE STARS.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.196
- THAT'S IT FOR REVIEW.
I'M FORREST MACNEIL,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.532
AND MY WIFE IS PROBABLY [bleep]
HER LAWYER RIGHT NOW.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.434
- AND I'M A.J. GIBBS.
GOOD NIGHT.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.068
[triumphant fanfare]

20:36.102 --> 20:37.570
SO YOU AGREE WITH ME?

20:37.604 --> 20:38.938
- YEAH, I THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.206
THEY'RE [bleep].
- SO MUCH CHEMISTRY.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.774
- DEFINITELY [bleep].
- YEAH.
