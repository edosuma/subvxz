Damn it.

00:47.117 --> 00:49.084
Get the EMTs over here!

00:49.169 --> 00:51.170
(in distance):
Base this is Delta One.

00:51.237 --> 00:52.671
We need EMTs here ASAP.

00:54.574 --> 00:57.075
Intel's good--
two cartel soldiers.

01:00.747 --> 01:02.515
Who's this one?

01:02.582 --> 01:04.599
He's definitely not cartel.

01:05.585 --> 01:07.303

Sam's been restoring

Oh.

02:10.036 --> 02:12.037
That's horrible.

02:12.122 --> 02:13.322
Yeah.

02:13.373 --> 02:14.623
Big guy's heartbroken.

02:14.691 --> 02:16.458
He was up all night
questioning everyone

02:16.526 --> 02:18.860
within a two-mile radius
of the storage unit.

02:18.912 --> 02:20.246
Working on that car

02:20.330 --> 02:22.631
was Sam's therapeutic refuge.

02:22.699 --> 02:24.016
Honestly, I don't think

02:24.084 --> 02:25.701
he ever wanted to finish it.

02:25.752 --> 02:27.419
Car like that
is either in a chop shop

02:27.504 --> 02:29.305
or being driven really hard
south of the border.

02:29.372 --> 02:30.306
That's not good.

02:30.373 --> 02:31.390
Okay, it's just a car.

02:31.474 --> 02:32.541
He's got insurance, right?

02:32.592 --> 02:33.642
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

02:33.710 --> 02:34.727
V-8 Magnum, four barrel carb

02:34.811 --> 02:36.395
with dual exhaust
is not just a car.

02:36.479 --> 02:37.713
Takes up hours of your time,

02:37.764 --> 02:39.932
you spend more cash
than the car is actually worth,

02:40.016 --> 02:40.799
and...

02:40.867 --> 02:42.518
for what exactly?

02:42.569 --> 02:44.069
What kind of man are you?

02:57.284 --> 02:58.417
What are we looking for?

02:58.501 --> 02:59.401
Charlene.

03:00.570 --> 03:02.204
- Charlene?
- Mr. Hanna,

03:02.255 --> 03:04.590
I can relate to your pain,

03:04.674 --> 03:07.259
considering what happened
to my Jaguar,

03:07.344 --> 03:09.678
but I cannot
allow you to utilize

03:09.746 --> 03:13.716
federal resources
to locate your personal vehicle.

03:13.767 --> 03:14.933
Besides, we have a case.

03:15.018 --> 03:15.934
Mr. Beale.

03:16.019 --> 03:18.971
Uh, sorry, Sam.

Hetty, I'm sorry about
what happened to your Jaguar,

03:22.692 --> 03:23.925

03:23.977 --> 03:26.945
Of course it wasn't.

03:29.149 --> 03:30.099
(whistles)

03:30.166 --> 03:32.234
We got a hot one--
three dead.

Two parts cartel,
one part wanted terrorist.

03:35.488 --> 03:36.955

03:38.775 --> 03:41.377
Hey, uh, what happened
to Sam's car?

03:41.444 --> 03:43.295
Yeah, I wouldn't
ask him about it.

03:45.298 --> 03:47.800
LAPD conducted
a raid this morning

03:47.884 --> 03:49.918
at a pawn shop
in Hollywood.

03:49.969 --> 03:53.138
They were targeting
the notorious Molina cartel,

03:53.223 --> 03:54.423
known throughout Mexico

03:54.474 --> 03:56.291
for their ruthless
and violent tactics.

03:56.343 --> 03:57.810
Two of the bodies

03:57.894 --> 04:00.729
were identified as lower level
cartel soldiers.

04:00.797 --> 04:02.631
Third body?

04:02.682 --> 04:04.633
Brings us to why we're here.

04:04.684 --> 04:07.252
LAPD asked for our help
in identifying this man.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.771
NELL:
Malik Atwa.

04:08.822 --> 04:09.855
A wanted terrorist

04:09.939 --> 04:11.440
and right-hand man
to Jamel Ahmed Shallah,

04:11.491 --> 04:14.159
one of the new faces
of al-Qaeda.

04:14.244 --> 04:15.477
Shallah's bad news.

04:15.528 --> 04:16.812
He took out a lot
of our troops

04:16.863 --> 04:18.146
while trying to make
a name for himself.

04:18.197 --> 04:19.781
KENSI:
So what's the connection

04:19.833 --> 04:21.033
with a Mexican drug cartel?

04:21.117 --> 04:22.418
Drugs? Money? Weapons?

04:22.485 --> 04:23.836
That would be
our case to figure out.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.338
SAM: Shallah could be providing
the cartel with Afghani heroin

04:26.423 --> 04:28.257
in exchange for access
to smuggling routes.

04:28.324 --> 04:30.459
There's always been a fear of
something like that happening.

04:30.510 --> 04:31.710
Last thing we need is al-Qaeda

04:31.795 --> 04:33.962
getting a base of operation
on the border.

04:34.013 --> 04:34.996
The cartel and Shallah are

04:35.048 --> 04:35.997
formidable enemies
by themselves.

04:36.049 --> 04:38.166
An alliance
could be disastrous.

04:38.218 --> 04:39.435
Any other
surveillance footage?

04:39.502 --> 04:40.436
ERIC:
Nearest traffic cam

04:40.503 --> 04:42.137
I could access
is a block away.

04:42.188 --> 04:44.273
All right, we'll take
the tac-squad guys.

04:44.340 --> 04:45.274
You got the
pawn shop.

04:45.341 --> 04:46.942
- Got it.
- Done.

04:47.009 --> 04:49.177
Hey. Find my car.

04:53.533 --> 04:54.950
The Molina cartel
has been trying

04:55.017 --> 04:57.152
to expand into L.A.
for the past year.

04:57.203 --> 04:58.954
What, no money, no drugs?

04:59.021 --> 05:00.603
What are a couple
of cartel grunts

05:00.670 --> 05:02.438
and a wanted terrorist
meeting about?

05:02.505 --> 05:04.723
Hoping you could tell us.

05:04.808 --> 05:07.059
We had intel on a shipment
of heroin coming in.

05:07.143 --> 05:08.677
When we found
this Atwa guy,

05:08.728 --> 05:10.813
we figured he may be
part of something bigger.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.314
Anything else stick out?

05:12.365 --> 05:15.350
20 years on the job,
I've lost a total of two men.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.519
Since dealing with the cartel,
I've lost nine.

05:18.872 --> 05:19.822
Evans had a family.

05:19.873 --> 05:20.823
He didn't deserve this.

05:20.874 --> 05:22.291
Used to be a time
when the cartels

05:22.358 --> 05:25.244
wouldn't tolerate jihadists
in their backyard.

05:25.328 --> 05:27.379
Didn't want
the international scrutiny.

05:27.464 --> 05:28.697
Now it's anything goes.

05:28.748 --> 05:30.499
Satellite phone.

05:30.550 --> 05:32.034
Job for Eric.

05:34.337 --> 05:36.538
Yeah, found that
in Atwa's pocket.

05:36.590 --> 05:38.390
Sunny Spot Motel.

05:38.475 --> 05:39.758
Sunset Boulevard.

05:39.843 --> 05:41.143
You guys run this down?

05:41.210 --> 05:43.646
Made all the evidence from
the scene available to you guys.

05:43.713 --> 05:44.730
It's in your hands.

05:44.814 --> 05:46.315
Appreciate your time.

05:46.382 --> 05:47.483

05:47.550 --> 05:49.551
Anything else comes up,
give us a call.

05:51.387 --> 05:53.722
Oh, Agent Hanna, LAPD's
doing everything we can

05:53.773 --> 05:56.358

06:02.398 --> 06:03.832
I'm just trying
to ease your grief.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.668
I'm not grieving.

06:05.735 --> 06:06.702
I'm pissed.

06:06.753 --> 06:08.120
Denial is the
first stage.

06:08.204 --> 06:09.237
That's natural.

06:12.626 --> 06:14.960
This is me
naturally ignoring you.

06:20.684 --> 06:21.600
Thanks.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.135
Thanks, Tom.
You bet.

06:23.219 --> 06:24.937
LAPD were pretty thorough.

06:25.021 --> 06:27.556
Yeah.

06:27.607 --> 06:29.708
Magazine stand has
security cameras.

06:29.776 --> 06:31.310
Eric couldn't access
anything close.

06:31.394 --> 06:34.546
Must be closed
circuit.

06:35.582 --> 06:36.982
Hi.

06:37.050 --> 06:40.552
Can I get, uh, <i>Paparazzi</i>
<i>Planet, Celebs After Midnight--</i>

06:40.620 --> 06:43.072
that should be
interesting--

06:43.123 --> 06:44.740
and, uh, your
surveillance tapes.

06:44.791 --> 06:46.208

06:46.275 --> 06:47.910

into restoring cars.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.095

07:10.316 --> 07:15.320
"Unwanted facial hair:
Electrolysis versus laser."

07:15.405 --> 07:17.322
I don't have
facial hair.

07:17.407 --> 07:18.807
Whatever you say, Pancho.

07:18.858 --> 07:20.359

<i>You don't mean that.</i>

07:30.503 --> 07:32.504
Yeah, I do.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.543
Stage two.

07:37.627 --> 07:38.711
What?

07:38.795 --> 07:41.380
Anger. It's the second
stage of grief.

07:41.464 --> 07:43.465
I'm not grieving,
I just want my car back.

07:43.516 --> 07:45.267
Hopefully it was just
a couple joy riders

07:45.334 --> 07:46.518
and LAPD will
pick them up.

07:46.603 --> 07:47.853
Since when
do joy riders have

07:47.937 --> 07:50.505
a diamond-tip drill
and plasma cutters?

07:50.557 --> 07:51.774
That's a good point.

07:51.841 --> 07:54.493
WOMAN: You guys looking
for a room?

07:54.561 --> 07:55.761
Federal agents.

07:55.829 --> 07:57.613
Need to see room 104.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.897
Oh, glad you have a key.

07:58.982 --> 08:00.199
The other guys kept my master.

08:00.283 --> 08:03.118
What other guys?

08:03.186 --> 08:05.788
FBI was here earlier.

08:05.855 --> 08:09.158
Now I've got to pay to have
all the locks replaced.

08:12.712 --> 08:14.863
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

08:14.914 --> 08:17.466
Who's paying for this?

08:31.913 --> 08:34.181
Disabled the cameras,
searched the motel room,

08:34.249 --> 08:36.601
and left without drawing
attention to themselves.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.869
Hetty spoke with the FBI.

08:37.936 --> 08:39.720
They assured her
they are not involved.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.306
Motel clerk said the guys
looked Middle Eastern.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.558
Shallah's guys?

08:43.609 --> 08:44.692
KENSI:
Terrorists are posing

08:44.759 --> 08:46.777
as FBI agents now?

08:46.862 --> 08:48.863
Gives a whole new meaning
to the term "extremist."

08:48.930 --> 08:50.948
I got something.
I think.

08:51.033 --> 08:53.451
All calls from this phone
were made to and received from

08:53.535 --> 08:55.603
another satellite phone
that's no longer online.

08:55.654 --> 08:57.038
They already ditched it,
if they're smart.

08:57.105 --> 08:59.040
I'm checking on any new
satellite phones that have

08:59.107 --> 09:00.541
come on-line
since this one went down.

09:00.609 --> 09:01.709
Maybe they replaced it.

09:01.776 --> 09:03.711
NELL: This is
the security cam footage

09:03.778 --> 09:05.329
from the magazine stand.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.131
See, this red Jeep was parked

09:07.215 --> 09:09.133
in front of
the pawn shop

09:09.217 --> 09:10.668
three hours
prior to the shootout.

09:10.752 --> 09:12.253
The driver camps out,

09:12.304 --> 09:16.390
then leaves
immediately afterwards.

09:16.458 --> 09:17.758
Any other angles?

09:17.809 --> 09:19.343
One camera, one angle.

09:21.396 --> 09:23.247
CB radio, baja kit.

09:23.315 --> 09:25.182
No license plate.

09:25.267 --> 09:26.651
SAM: Female driver,
brunette.

09:26.735 --> 09:28.402
Trying to keep a low profile.

09:28.470 --> 09:29.904
Looks like
she's running surveillance.

09:29.971 --> 09:31.639
DEEKS:
Lookout?

09:31.690 --> 09:33.140
If she is, she's not a good one.

09:33.191 --> 09:35.109
- Player?
CALLEN: Maybe.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.277
Or the girlfriend of one.

09:36.328 --> 09:37.445
At the very least,

09:37.496 --> 09:39.580
maybe she saw something useful.

09:39.648 --> 09:41.482
Can ask her in person.
Kaleidoscope got a hit.

09:41.533 --> 09:44.151
She's headed east on
Cesar Chavez Boulevard downtown.

09:46.121 --> 09:47.922
Eric.

09:47.989 --> 09:49.590
You can find
that Jeep,

09:49.658 --> 09:50.925
but you can't find
my Challenger?

09:50.992 --> 09:54.011
Uh... still looking.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.685
(scoffs)

10:03.221 --> 10:04.672
SAM:
<i>Talk to us, Eric.</i>

10:04.723 --> 10:06.340
ERIC:
Jeep has stopped.

10:06.391 --> 10:09.009
Looks like a parking lot in
the 500 block of North Main.

10:09.061 --> 10:09.860
How close?

10:09.945 --> 10:10.844
Five blocks.

10:10.896 --> 10:12.897
Kensi and Deeks
are almost there.

10:16.017 --> 10:18.285
I can find that Jeep, but
I can't find Sam's Challenger?

10:18.353 --> 10:19.403
If it's on the road,

10:19.488 --> 10:20.571
it'll show up.

10:20.656 --> 10:22.623
I mean, you can't
hide from Kaleidoscope.

10:24.242 --> 10:27.128
You have started
a Kaleidoscope search...

10:27.195 --> 10:28.696
Not exactly.

10:28.747 --> 10:31.298
I, uh, plugged into
the LAPD database.

10:31.366 --> 10:33.417
As soon as the car is found,
I will get an alert.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.669
You're right.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.254
That's not exactly
a Kaleidoscope search.

10:37.339 --> 10:39.707
So... what are we waiting for?

10:39.758 --> 10:41.642
We?

10:41.710 --> 10:42.643
You.

10:42.711 --> 10:44.729
Hetty told Sam

10:44.813 --> 10:47.064
no use of federal resources
for personal matters.

10:47.149 --> 10:50.050
Is this the same
rebel Eric Beale

10:50.102 --> 10:52.019
who completed level five
of <i>Warrior Quest</i>

10:52.087 --> 10:53.521
on the big screen in ops?

10:53.572 --> 10:57.108
The same rebel
who dared to eat

10:57.192 --> 11:00.444
Oreo cookies in ops
without a napkin?

11:00.529 --> 11:03.998
The same rebel
who broke the Internet.

11:04.065 --> 11:05.232
But it's Hetty.

11:05.283 --> 11:06.667
But it's Sam.

11:06.735 --> 11:08.836
I feel like I'm caught
between a rock and a hard place.

11:08.903 --> 11:09.920
You are.

11:10.005 --> 11:11.539
While Hetty scares me
intellectually,

11:11.590 --> 11:14.175
I fear Sam on a more
physically visceral level.

11:14.242 --> 11:15.242
Uh-huh.

11:19.347 --> 11:20.347
All right, Beale...

11:22.017 --> 11:23.917
...let's do this.

11:31.092 --> 11:34.862
La Iglesia de Neustra Senora
La Reina de Los Angeles.

11:34.929 --> 11:37.264
Does that mean your miss-tache
grows long at night?

11:38.767 --> 11:40.701
You're really lame.

11:40.769 --> 11:42.770
It actually means Church of our
Lady the Queen of the Angels.

11:42.821 --> 11:44.739
Mm.

11:45.774 --> 11:47.558
KENSI:
Red Jeep.

11:47.626 --> 11:48.609
With a baja kit.

11:48.660 --> 11:50.044
KENSI:
Brunette.

11:50.111 --> 11:51.545
And she's our driver?

11:51.613 --> 11:52.696
DEEKS:
I hope so.

11:52.764 --> 11:54.782
<i>Latina mas fina.</i>

11:56.284 --> 11:58.753
KENSI: Someone's
a little paranoid.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.731
Deeks, take the back.

12:28.817 --> 12:31.702
(both grunting)

12:43.765 --> 12:45.049
Enough!

12:45.133 --> 12:46.383
DEEKS: You good?
- Turn around.

12:46.468 --> 12:47.885
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, I'm fine.

12:47.969 --> 12:49.220
DEEKS: You sure about that?
'Cause it looked like

12:49.304 --> 12:50.387
she tagged you a few times.

12:50.472 --> 12:52.022
Really? Kind of
looked I had her.

12:52.107 --> 12:53.808
Thank you.
Who are you?

12:55.310 --> 12:57.311
Kensi, walk it off.

12:58.947 --> 13:00.865
Search her,
Deeks.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.034
You got a name?

13:06.688 --> 13:09.123
Huh? Name?

13:09.190 --> 13:10.791
Oh, you don't
have a name,

13:10.859 --> 13:12.543
but you do have...

13:12.627 --> 13:13.828
a weapon.

13:13.879 --> 13:16.147
DEEKS: Oh, wow, this just
got interesting.

13:16.214 --> 13:18.966
Unless this is fake...

13:20.051 --> 13:22.052
she's a cop.

13:23.204 --> 13:24.972
I'm a cop, too.
LAPD.

13:25.039 --> 13:28.676
None of these guys--
just me... and you.

13:28.727 --> 13:30.060
Cops.

13:31.096 --> 13:32.179
Deeks.

13:32.230 --> 13:34.231
Guess you're under arrest.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.654
Eva Espinoza.

13:47.739 --> 13:50.057
Police Chief.
Loreto, Mexico.

13:50.124 --> 13:52.075
There's great surfing
down there.

13:52.126 --> 13:54.077
What's a Loreto police chief
doing in Los Angeles?

13:54.145 --> 13:56.079
And don't say <i>America's</i>
<i>Next Top Model</i>

13:56.130 --> 13:57.748
'cause that is my partner's
favorite show.

13:59.116 --> 14:01.385
You're kind of young
for a police chief.

14:01.452 --> 14:04.054
When your last
three police chiefs

14:04.121 --> 14:05.973
are murdered in cold blood,

14:06.057 --> 14:07.958
the only prerequisite
is a pulse.

14:08.009 --> 14:09.259
DEEKS: So how'd you
get the job?

14:09.310 --> 14:10.460
You draw the short straw?

14:10.511 --> 14:11.728
I volunteered.

14:11.796 --> 14:13.430
Everyone else was terrified.

14:14.465 --> 14:16.600
Trying to be a martyr?

14:16.651 --> 14:18.268
Innocent people
are being murdered

14:18.319 --> 14:20.437
by the hands
of the Molina Cartel.

14:20.488 --> 14:21.905
Someone had to step up.

14:21.973 --> 14:24.241
She has
a warrior's spirit.

14:24.308 --> 14:27.244
Takes guts to take a stand
knowing you're marked for death.

14:27.311 --> 14:30.030
She has experience
with the Molina Cartel.

14:30.114 --> 14:32.749
Let's hope she knows
how Shallah is involved.

14:32.817 --> 14:34.418
What were you doing
at the pawn shop?

14:36.537 --> 14:38.488
Tracking Diego Molina.

14:38.539 --> 14:40.090
Wow.

14:40.157 --> 14:42.876
That guy makes Scarface
look like Justin Bieber.

14:42.961 --> 14:46.096
He runs the cartel
from a distance.

14:46.163 --> 14:48.465
Rumor has it,
he lives here in LA.

14:48.516 --> 14:51.101
So you were planning on just
walking up to him and arresting him?

14:51.168 --> 14:53.503
In Loreto, he is surrounded
by an army.

14:53.554 --> 14:55.222
In America, only by a few.

14:56.691 --> 14:59.009
Seems more familiar
than speculative.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.144
She knows more than
she's letting on,

15:01.195 --> 15:02.312
if you ask me.

15:02.363 --> 15:03.513
What's up, Nell?

15:03.564 --> 15:04.815
Uh, plenty.

15:04.866 --> 15:07.484
I was running a full data
analysis on Eva

15:07.535 --> 15:10.737
and found a slight
discrepancy in her story.

15:10.822 --> 15:11.955
More like an omission.

15:12.023 --> 15:13.690
I just downloaded a
photo to your phones.

15:13.741 --> 15:17.160
NELL: Eva may not be
as noble as we think.

15:17.211 --> 15:18.462
Two years ago,

15:18.529 --> 15:20.130
he was killed
by the Molina Cartel.

15:20.197 --> 15:21.999
Kensi, Deeks,

15:22.050 --> 15:25.002
you want to get back in here?

15:26.637 --> 15:29.539
You-- don't go anywhere.

15:29.590 --> 15:30.841
(scoffs)

15:30.892 --> 15:33.176
Check your phones.

15:36.064 --> 15:37.347
Who's this?

15:37.398 --> 15:39.149
He was killed
by the Molina Cartel.

15:40.651 --> 15:42.719
This could be a revenge tour.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.387
Find out.

15:49.694 --> 15:51.611
It's a noble thing
you're doing.

15:51.696 --> 15:54.064
It's the right thing.

15:54.115 --> 15:56.416
Sure it's not
a personal vendetta?

15:59.120 --> 16:00.754
KENSI:
Your brother Antonio.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.928
He was only seven years old.

16:09.580 --> 16:12.182
He got caught in a crossfire.

16:14.435 --> 16:17.604
There was nothing I could do
to save him.

16:23.194 --> 16:25.445
I tracked two of Molina's men
to L.A.,

16:25.530 --> 16:27.981
but I lost them
at that pawn shop.

16:28.066 --> 16:31.768
Did you know Molina's Cartel
is involved with al-Qaeda?

16:31.819 --> 16:33.770
No.

16:33.821 --> 16:37.124
No, but it doesn't surprise me.

16:37.208 --> 16:39.459
They have their tentacles
into everything

16:39.544 --> 16:42.245
from law enforcement
to government officials.

16:42.296 --> 16:45.999
Do you have idea why
they would be meeting?

16:46.084 --> 16:48.552
No.

16:48.619 --> 16:51.221
Okay, great.
We'll take it from here.

16:51.288 --> 16:52.839
You can go back to Mexico.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.842
If you want to detain me,
go ahead,

16:55.927 --> 16:57.561
but I'm in the States legally.

16:57.628 --> 16:58.929
As a civilian.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.897
You keep playing cop,
we'll deport you

17:00.965 --> 17:02.599
faster than you can say Tijuana.

17:02.650 --> 17:04.851
What exactly do you
mean by that?

17:04.935 --> 17:06.685
Okay, ladies, ladies,

17:06.771 --> 17:09.021
I think you should probably
draw in the claws.

17:09.107 --> 17:12.108
One cat fight a day
is probably plenty.

17:13.778 --> 17:19.148
Thank you for your cooperation
and diligence.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.750
What was that all about?

17:20.818 --> 17:23.119
Well, I'd say that someone's
being a little territorial

17:23.171 --> 17:25.789
on the account of the connection
between Eva and me.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.790
- You're out of your mind.
SAM: I'm with Kensi.

17:27.842 --> 17:29.793
Any woman that connects with you

17:29.844 --> 17:31.962
is clearly suspect
if not certifiable.

17:32.013 --> 17:34.330
ERIC: Hey, guys.
SAM: What's up, Eric?

17:34.382 --> 17:37.000
So I've been monitoring new
satellite phones coming on-line,

17:37.051 --> 17:39.169
and two phones with sequential
serial numbers

17:39.220 --> 17:40.554
were activated an hour ago.

17:40.638 --> 17:42.389
They were purchased
in the same store.

17:42.473 --> 17:43.623
Cash sale.
Hollywood Boulevard.

17:43.691 --> 17:45.008
Get a warrant, listen

17:45.059 --> 17:46.276
on both phones.

17:46.343 --> 17:47.561
You guys talk to Nell, see what
she's dug up on Diego Molina.

17:47.645 --> 17:49.229
Got it.

17:49.313 --> 17:52.182
Eric, tell me you're at least
looking for my car.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.568
I... yeah. I'm... you know,

17:54.652 --> 17:57.237
I have actually got
a really promising lead,

17:57.321 --> 18:00.157
so I will just keep you
in the loop.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.242
ERIC: Okay. All right, bye.
SAM: Er--

18:02.326 --> 18:04.244
"Promising lead"?

18:04.328 --> 18:08.131
I tend to overdo it
when I panic.

18:08.199 --> 18:10.533
Sam's going to kill me.

18:23.347 --> 18:26.600
My father bought Charlene in
1970, brand-new off the line.

18:26.684 --> 18:29.169
She's the reason I drive
the Challenger today.

18:29.237 --> 18:30.637
It's tough.

18:30.705 --> 18:33.990
I promise, if I get her back,
I'll use a bigger lock.

18:34.058 --> 18:35.992
No, a better
security system.

18:36.060 --> 18:38.612
Maybe a guard dog.

18:38.679 --> 18:40.413
You're bargaining.

18:40.498 --> 18:42.082
That's stage three.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.584
Last I checked, Nate was
out in the field.

18:44.669 --> 18:47.537
I'm just saying, I know
how much Charlene meant to you.

18:47.588 --> 18:48.872
You got a name
for the new Challenger?

18:48.923 --> 18:50.674
- No.
- No?

18:50.741 --> 18:53.009
How about Cheryl?

18:53.077 --> 18:54.544
How about no?

18:54.595 --> 18:57.347
(entrance bell chimes)
How you doing?

18:57.414 --> 18:58.265
Federal agents.

18:58.349 --> 18:59.933
We need to see your sales log

19:00.001 --> 19:01.268
and your video surveillance.

19:01.352 --> 19:03.103
Sorry, I can't help
you with that.

19:03.170 --> 19:05.889
We could get a warrant.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.924
Then make it out to the FBI;
they already took them.

19:07.975 --> 19:09.259
I asked them to make copies,

19:09.310 --> 19:11.261
but they said they
didn't have time.

19:11.312 --> 19:12.612
These "agents"--

19:12.697 --> 19:15.398
Middle Eastern,
American accents?

19:15.449 --> 19:16.783
Friends of yours?

19:22.623 --> 19:24.958
These guys are making
all the moves that we would.

19:25.042 --> 19:27.127
They're acting like they're law
enforcement. But they're not.

19:27.211 --> 19:29.563
Could be Shallah's guys
covering their own tracks.

19:29.630 --> 19:32.582
Whoever they are,
they're connected.

19:32.633 --> 19:35.585
ERIC: Best I could do with this
public surveillance camera.

19:35.636 --> 19:37.587
Just like the motel.

19:37.638 --> 19:39.256
- What about Eva?
- What about Eva?

19:39.307 --> 19:41.007
Well, she was able
to track the cartel

19:41.092 --> 19:42.509
to the pawn shop
from Mexico.

19:42.593 --> 19:44.728
Maybe she has someone
on the inside.

19:44.795 --> 19:46.313
Well, Shallah and the cartel
are in business together,

19:46.397 --> 19:47.797
their paths are bound to cross.

19:47.848 --> 19:49.899
SAM:
She could be our in.

19:49.967 --> 19:50.967
I thought you didn't trust her.

19:51.018 --> 19:51.968
I don't.

19:52.019 --> 19:52.969
CALLEN:
I don't either.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.187
I had Nell track her

19:54.272 --> 19:55.655
from the boat shed.

19:58.359 --> 20:00.410
Eva ended up at this downtown
parking lot.

20:00.477 --> 20:02.245
Where she met this man.

20:02.313 --> 20:04.748
CALLEN: We I.D. this guy?
NELL: Working on it.

20:07.318 --> 20:09.452
Now, that's a connection, Deeks.

20:09.503 --> 20:11.821
Could be our inside man.

20:11.872 --> 20:14.291
SAM: Let's see if he leads us
to the cartel or al-Qaeda.

20:14.342 --> 20:15.792
Oh, where are they now?

20:15.843 --> 20:17.210
Uh, after they left
the parking lot,

20:17.278 --> 20:18.828
there weren't enough cameras
to keep a visual.

20:18.879 --> 20:19.929
How long ago did they leave?

20:19.997 --> 20:20.930
NELL:
30 minutes.

20:20.998 --> 20:22.432
They never returned
to their cars.

20:22.499 --> 20:23.717
I think we lost them.

20:23.801 --> 20:24.968
Actually, maybe not.

20:25.019 --> 20:26.019
May I?

20:27.688 --> 20:29.222
Activating GPS tracker.

20:29.307 --> 20:30.223
Got her.

20:30.308 --> 20:31.524
She's downtown.

20:32.526 --> 20:34.027
I tagged her
at the boat shed.

20:34.111 --> 20:37.697
I know a woman on a
mission when I see one.

20:37.782 --> 20:39.783
Meow.

20:46.207 --> 20:48.908
CALLEN:
According to the GPS tracker,

20:48.976 --> 20:50.327
Eva is in the piñata store

20:50.378 --> 20:51.378
across the street.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.456
DEEKS: Got a guy coming out
of the store; he's armed.

21:03.524 --> 21:07.293
Not the guy Eva met
at the parking lot.

21:07.361 --> 21:08.595
I got a photo coming, Eric.

21:08.679 --> 21:10.146
DEEKS:
I need an I.D.

21:10.214 --> 21:13.149
All right.
Running it through facial rec.

21:13.217 --> 21:16.186
Kensi, Deeks,
stop him.

21:16.237 --> 21:17.987
We're on him.

21:18.055 --> 21:19.606
ERIC:
All right, we got it.

21:19.690 --> 21:21.491
Carlos Molina.

21:21.558 --> 21:24.060
He's the suspected trigger man
for the Molina Cartel.

21:24.111 --> 21:26.663
Brother of kingpin Diego Molina.

21:30.534 --> 21:31.501
Federal agent.

21:31.568 --> 21:33.336
KENSI:
Stop.

21:34.622 --> 21:36.572
DEEKS:
I'll take that.

21:36.624 --> 21:38.408
<i>Tranquila.</i>

21:39.460 --> 21:40.460
Put your hands

21:40.544 --> 21:41.761
behind your back.

21:43.747 --> 21:45.548
What's with the piñata?

21:45.599 --> 21:49.235
It's for my nephew's birthday.

21:49.303 --> 21:50.937
Nephew, huh?

21:59.263 --> 22:01.564
You owe me a piñata, amigo.

22:01.615 --> 22:04.067
Well, that's the thing
about working with family.

22:04.118 --> 22:05.785
Always a bad idea.

22:05.870 --> 22:08.104
Never really works out.

22:10.124 --> 22:11.207
DEEKS:
Got him, guys.

22:11.275 --> 22:12.992
The store's a cartel front.

22:13.077 --> 22:15.044
And Eva's inside.

22:21.952 --> 22:23.086
Her cover's blown.

22:23.137 --> 22:25.755
CALLEN:
Or she's got a death wish.

22:26.957 --> 22:29.175
Kensi, Deeks, we got something.

22:30.794 --> 22:32.979
Sam, Shallah is in the SUV.

22:37.835 --> 22:39.736
Federal agents!

22:40.688 --> 22:43.022
(bystanders screaming)

22:46.026 --> 22:47.110
SHALLAH:
Drive! Drive!

23:01.091 --> 23:02.125
(tires squealing)

23:06.580 --> 23:09.349
Jamel Ahmed Shallah
is in L.A.

23:20.144 --> 23:21.511
Your informant?

23:21.562 --> 23:24.481
Luis.

23:24.532 --> 23:26.149
He was a cop.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.850
And my friend.

23:44.601 --> 23:45.801
Watch your head.

23:56.139 --> 23:57.723
The cartel got
the drop on us.

23:58.483 --> 24:00.531
We knew each other
since we were children.

24:00.556 --> 24:02.350
We decided to join
the force together.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.572
To make a difference.

24:03.597 --> 24:04.982
It's hard enough
to be a cop in L.A.

24:05.007 --> 24:06.895
I can't even imagine
what it's like in Mexico.

24:07.491 --> 24:08.859
When I volunteered
to be chief,

24:08.884 --> 24:12.679
I personally chose Luis
for the undercover operation.

24:12.704 --> 24:14.189
This is not your fault.

24:14.214 --> 24:16.445
They will go after
his family now.

24:16.470 --> 24:19.090
And we're going to do everything
we can to stop them.

24:19.142 --> 24:20.610
Thank you.

24:38.178 --> 24:39.662
Is she okay?

24:39.713 --> 24:41.948
Considering she's moving up
the endangered species list,

24:42.015 --> 24:43.666
I'd say she's dandy.

24:43.717 --> 24:45.334
Why didn't they kill her, too?

24:45.385 --> 24:47.103
Trying to find out
what she knew?

24:47.170 --> 24:49.105
Some sick gift to Shallah?

24:49.172 --> 24:51.274
Why would Shallah risk
coming to Los Angeles?

24:51.341 --> 24:54.060
Why not meet the
cartel in Mexico?

24:54.144 --> 24:55.511
Why go into the lion's den
if you don't have to?

24:55.562 --> 24:57.146
Los Angeles is
neutral territory.

24:57.197 --> 24:59.014
(phone ringing)

24:59.066 --> 25:00.366
Yeah, Eric.

25:00.450 --> 25:03.069
Hey, guys, Shallah's SUV
was dumped and torched

25:03.153 --> 25:04.520
off the 90 freeway.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.955
Got it.

25:06.022 --> 25:07.323
So what now?

25:07.374 --> 25:08.908
CALLEN: The men posing
as FBI agents--

25:08.992 --> 25:11.627
they've been cleaning up after
Shallah every step of the way.

25:11.695 --> 25:13.629
At the motel,
at the phone store...

25:13.697 --> 25:14.714
The piñata shop?

25:14.798 --> 25:16.549
It's worth a shot.

25:16.633 --> 25:19.368
Okay, so what's the plan?

25:41.742 --> 25:43.609
You good?

25:43.694 --> 25:46.829
Why do you ask?

25:46.896 --> 25:50.116
So far you've
done a car, a gun

25:50.200 --> 25:52.702
and I believe
that's a dead body.

25:52.753 --> 25:55.204
It's amazing detail.

25:55.255 --> 25:56.622
I'm good.

26:00.076 --> 26:02.128
It's okay to be depressed.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.212
I'm not depressed.

26:03.263 --> 26:04.347
You will be.

26:04.414 --> 26:06.182
Stage four.

26:06.249 --> 26:07.916
Look, I'm not depressed,

26:07.968 --> 26:11.270
bargaining, angry or in denial.

26:11.355 --> 26:13.756
But I am getting
a little irritated.

26:13.807 --> 26:15.224
Are you hungry?

26:15.275 --> 26:17.560
- Hunger is not a stage.
- That's true, but loss of appetite

26:17.611 --> 26:19.528
is a sign of depression.

26:20.948 --> 26:22.949
Keep it up.

26:23.033 --> 26:24.617
DEEKS:
All right, it's been two hours.

26:24.701 --> 26:26.902
If they haven't come by now,
they're probably not coming.

26:27.988 --> 26:30.906
Oop-- and...
maybe I spoke too soon.

26:30.958 --> 26:34.126
Oh, ye of little faith.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.285
SAM:
Kensi, heads up.

26:49.977 --> 26:52.461
- FBI.
- You're a little late.

26:52.512 --> 26:54.063
Where were you
when we needed you?

26:54.130 --> 26:56.965
I'd like to talk to you about
the incident this afternoon.

26:57.017 --> 26:58.601
You have surveillance tapes?

26:58.652 --> 27:02.104
Um, sounds like a question
for my manager.

27:02.155 --> 27:06.325
I don't even know if we have
a surveillance system. Um...

27:07.444 --> 27:08.694
Company.

27:08.779 --> 27:09.779
Federal agents. Stop.

27:09.830 --> 27:11.197
Stop!

27:11.281 --> 27:12.965
Like she said,
Federal agents. Stop.

27:13.033 --> 27:14.450
DEEKS:
Why don't they ever stop?

27:14.501 --> 27:16.985
It amazes me
that they never stop.

27:17.037 --> 27:19.705
So who are you really?

27:20.490 --> 27:22.157
CIA.

27:22.209 --> 27:24.126
Oh, now you're the CIA?

27:24.177 --> 27:25.044
SAM:
What's next?

27:25.112 --> 27:26.995
Jedi knights?

27:30.450 --> 27:33.193
Hey, Sam. The CIA files
have been sent through

27:33.218 --> 27:33.769
to the boat shed.

27:33.770 --> 27:36.275
Don't forget to check with CHP
about Charlene.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.023
On it.

27:37.024 --> 27:41.193
- Let me guess-- find his car?
- Mm-hmm.

27:41.278 --> 27:43.779
Whoa, you're not
going to believe this.

27:43.847 --> 27:46.816
LAPD found Sam's Challenger.
It's in Van Nuys.

27:46.867 --> 27:48.868
Vehicle identification number's
a match.

27:48.952 --> 27:50.286
I'll call Sam.

27:50.353 --> 27:53.322
Yeah, bup-bup...
We need to be sure.

27:53.373 --> 27:55.241
- Visual confirmation?
- Yeah.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.910
Okay, security, traffic,
ATM cams.

27:57.994 --> 27:59.628
No, no, no, no, no.

27:59.696 --> 28:00.880
Not good enough.

28:00.964 --> 28:02.998
We need physical confirmation.

28:03.050 --> 28:04.300
You mean...?

28:04.367 --> 28:06.419
Field trip.

28:06.503 --> 28:09.321
Just don't tell Hetty.

28:09.389 --> 28:14.060
Agent Banks, Agent Figg.

28:14.144 --> 28:15.394
I.D.'s check out.

28:15.479 --> 28:17.346
They are CIA.

28:17.397 --> 28:19.882
Your agency must be so proud.

28:19.933 --> 28:22.818
CALLEN: Hmm. Well, before we
turn you over to your director,

28:22.886 --> 28:25.071
you want to explain why

28:25.155 --> 28:28.441
you're running around L.A.,
cleaning up after al-Qaeda?

28:28.525 --> 28:30.276
SAM: You forget
your missions statement?

28:30.343 --> 28:31.727
Cut a better deal?

28:31.778 --> 28:34.730
With the holidays coming up,
you needed a little extra cash?

28:41.037 --> 28:44.006
Still not talking, huh?

28:44.073 --> 28:46.842
SAM: If that's how
you want to play it...

28:46.910 --> 28:48.911
G.

28:50.046 --> 28:51.680
Wow, so much

28:51.748 --> 28:53.632
for inter-agency cooperation.

28:55.185 --> 28:57.252
Those guys are either
dirty or they're working

28:57.277 --> 28:58.477
some other angle.

28:58.522 --> 28:59.889
Guys, Eric just sent us
encrypted files

28:59.940 --> 29:01.357
he found on their smart phones.

29:05.612 --> 29:07.113
Reaper drones.

29:07.197 --> 29:09.281
Photos and specs
of the new generation UAV.

29:09.366 --> 29:11.650
Bigger, more versatile
and can carry up

29:11.735 --> 29:13.736
to 15 times more ordinance
than its predecessor.

29:13.787 --> 29:15.905
According to this file
on Banks and Figg,

29:15.956 --> 29:17.907
they worked in drone operations
in the Middle East.

29:17.958 --> 29:20.075
So, how are Reaper drones,
Shallah

29:20.127 --> 29:21.911
and a Mexican cartel related?

29:21.962 --> 29:23.712
Q and A round two.

29:25.949 --> 29:28.968
You want to fill in the blanks?

29:32.055 --> 29:33.722
We haven't
contacted your boss

29:33.790 --> 29:34.840
at the agency yet.

29:34.925 --> 29:36.792
But we got him
on speed dial.

29:38.061 --> 29:39.812
SAM:
It's going to be embarrassing.

29:39.896 --> 29:41.931
Two CIA agents caught
trying to sell

29:41.998 --> 29:43.649
a Reaper drone to a terrorist.

29:45.602 --> 29:47.269
We're not trying
to sell anything.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.487
- No?
- No.

29:48.572 --> 29:49.605
We're trying to recover it.

29:49.656 --> 29:50.990
BANKS: A couple weeks ago,
we were running

29:51.074 --> 29:52.658
a covert operation
in the Middle East

29:52.742 --> 29:54.309
to lure out
Jamel Ahmed Shallah

29:54.361 --> 29:56.245
by offering up the Reaper drones
as bait.

29:56.312 --> 29:57.479
Things got out of hand.

29:57.531 --> 29:58.814
We think
there was a leak.

29:58.865 --> 30:00.082
CALLEN:
And you lost them?

30:00.149 --> 30:01.333
FIGG:
One.

30:01.418 --> 30:02.985
We lost one.

30:03.036 --> 30:05.454
You handed a Reaper drone
to al-Qaeda?

30:05.505 --> 30:07.122
This is why I left the CIA.

30:07.174 --> 30:08.541
SAM: Well, I was right
about one thing.

30:08.625 --> 30:09.992
It's going to be
embarrassing.

30:10.043 --> 30:11.126
Well, more importantly,

30:11.178 --> 30:12.928
it's a threat
to national security.

30:12.996 --> 30:14.430
Which is why you should
have contacted us

30:14.497 --> 30:16.215
from day one instead
of trying to save face.

30:16.299 --> 30:18.767
Or was it more a case of butt
saving than face saving.

30:21.671 --> 30:24.223
The hijackers were
Shallah's men.

30:24.307 --> 30:26.892
A week ago, the drone was moved
to Afghanistan.

30:26.977 --> 30:30.479
So what's the connection
with Molina's cartel?

30:30.530 --> 30:32.731
Shallah needs money to bankroll
his terrorist activities.

30:32.816 --> 30:34.283
He's going to sell the drone.

30:34.350 --> 30:37.369
And Molina was
the highest bidder.

30:37.454 --> 30:39.855
A drone could tip the drug
war in Molina's favor.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.324
He could destroy his rivals
and target law enforcement.

30:42.375 --> 30:43.709
When you guys screw up,

30:43.793 --> 30:45.544
you really go all the way,
don't you?

30:45.629 --> 30:47.663
The drone is now here.

30:47.731 --> 30:50.165
In Los Angeles.

30:50.217 --> 30:53.052
We know where
it's being moved.

30:55.038 --> 30:57.172
Keep talking.

31:00.093 --> 31:02.511
You've got to give us
a chance to salvage this.

31:02.562 --> 31:04.179
We don't have to do anything.

31:09.052 --> 31:10.436
Shipping container.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.488
San Pedro.

31:17.994 --> 31:19.361
FIGG:
We're early.

31:19.412 --> 31:21.413
CALLEN: You're confident your intel
is still legit?

31:21.498 --> 31:23.999
BANKS: We've got a source in
the cartel on our payroll.

31:24.067 --> 31:26.018
DEEKS: It's nice to see
our tax dollars at work.

31:26.086 --> 31:27.286
We should scope this place out.

31:27.354 --> 31:29.421
Take Banks.
Kensi, get a bird's-eye view.

31:29.506 --> 31:31.257
Deeks, cover the west perimeter.
You're with me.

31:33.260 --> 31:34.910
Company.

31:35.929 --> 31:37.463
I thought you said
she went back?

31:37.547 --> 31:39.214
I thought you said you were
going back.

31:39.266 --> 31:42.051
I said I would warn
Luis' family. Which I did.

31:42.919 --> 31:44.937
DEEKS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:45.005 --> 31:45.854
What are you doing?

31:45.922 --> 31:47.973
This man works for the cartel.

31:48.858 --> 31:50.225
Drop your weapon now.

31:50.293 --> 31:52.361
DEEKS:
Eva... Eva!

31:52.428 --> 31:54.897
This man is CIA.

31:54.948 --> 31:56.615
Then the CIA murdered
my little brother.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.220
(tires squealing)

32:01.288 --> 32:03.055
(gunfire)
Look out!

32:03.123 --> 32:04.406
Take cover!

32:21.624 --> 32:24.093
(distant gunfire)

32:29.983 --> 32:31.767
Gun down, now!

32:36.489 --> 32:37.973
Guys in the car
are cartel soldiers.

32:39.909 --> 32:41.443
They left me no choice.

32:48.752 --> 32:50.252
You shouldn't have
come back, Eva.

33:08.668 --> 33:10.920
KENSI: Eric's pulling up
ck security cam footage.

33:12.973 --> 33:14.840
I've alerted LAPD.

33:14.891 --> 33:16.842
They're on their way;
should be with you shortly.

33:16.893 --> 33:18.427
What were
you thinking?

33:18.512 --> 33:19.562
It's not what
it looks like.

33:19.646 --> 33:20.846
It looks like revenge.

33:20.897 --> 33:22.431
Figg shot his partner
during the attack.

33:22.516 --> 33:23.933
And then he
turned to me.

33:25.051 --> 33:26.235
He left me no choice.

33:26.319 --> 33:27.319
Yeah, we'll see about that.

33:28.238 --> 33:29.655
Eric, any luck?

33:29.722 --> 33:30.990
Eva's telling the truth.

33:31.057 --> 33:32.741
She shot Agent Figg
in self defense.

33:32.826 --> 33:34.527
I'm sending the video
to your tablet.

33:39.516 --> 33:41.867
Come on, you should
wait in the car.

33:43.837 --> 33:45.404
ERIC:
Video's uploaded.

33:48.875 --> 33:51.427
KENSI:
Wow. Okay...

33:51.511 --> 33:53.178
Why would Figg
shoot Banks?

33:56.132 --> 33:57.433
Banks could have
figured out

33:57.517 --> 33:59.468
his partner was
working for the cartel.

33:59.553 --> 34:00.853
Figg brought us here early.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.271
He led us into a trap.

34:02.355 --> 34:04.306
The exchange is
going down somewhere else.

34:04.391 --> 34:06.392
Eric, you had any luck with
Shallah's satellite phone?

34:06.443 --> 34:08.060
He's got to be close.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.695
Callen, we accessed all numbers
from Agent Figg's smartphone.

34:09.762 --> 34:11.230
We got several hits.

34:11.281 --> 34:13.983
One is a satellite phone
in the San Pedro shipyard.

34:14.067 --> 34:16.118
Shipyard's right over there.

34:18.938 --> 34:20.606
Eric, get a unit down here
for Banks and Figg.

34:20.657 --> 34:22.123
What about Eva?

34:24.761 --> 34:26.295
She goes lone wolf, it's on you.

34:30.283 --> 34:33.502
Hey, guys, I'm sending you
the layout of the shipyard.

34:33.587 --> 34:35.286
KENSI: Okay, got it.
Dock three.

34:58.862 --> 35:00.245
All the players
are here.

35:01.648 --> 35:03.315
How are you?

35:05.985 --> 35:07.002
(speaks Arabic)

35:11.458 --> 35:12.708
So's the needle in the haystack.

35:12.792 --> 35:14.760
(speaking indistinctly)

35:14.827 --> 35:16.295
Focus on Shallah and Molina.

35:17.430 --> 35:18.931
(speaking indistinctly)

35:26.172 --> 35:28.440
Deeks, your love connection
is about to get us killed.

35:28.508 --> 35:29.558
I'm on it.

35:29.643 --> 35:30.609
CALLEN:
Deeks.

35:30.677 --> 35:31.510
Quietly.

35:35.899 --> 35:36.815
So much for quietly.

35:39.486 --> 35:40.169
Look out!

35:45.659 --> 35:46.542
Federal agents!

35:54.417 --> 35:55.668
I got Shallah.

36:00.540 --> 36:01.640
You okay?

36:01.708 --> 36:03.058
Yeah. I'm fine.

36:08.214 --> 36:08.981
Kensi!

36:12.018 --> 36:13.268
Deeks! Molina!

36:13.353 --> 36:15.070
I'm on it!

36:17.273 --> 36:18.223
(ignition sputtering)

36:18.274 --> 36:19.441
Don't even try.

36:19.526 --> 36:21.493
(tires screeching)

36:39.095 --> 36:40.295
Do it! Do it!

36:40.380 --> 36:41.296
Kill me!

36:41.381 --> 36:44.416
(grunting)

36:44.467 --> 36:45.851
Kill me.

36:45.918 --> 36:47.603
Do it!

36:47.687 --> 36:49.188
You wish.

36:53.943 --> 36:55.260
You going to stop her?

36:55.311 --> 36:56.311
I got her.

36:56.396 --> 36:57.312
Eva.

36:57.397 --> 36:58.864
Eva.

36:58.931 --> 37:00.232
Listen,

37:00.283 --> 37:02.067
if you want to do this,
I'm not gonna stop you.

37:02.118 --> 37:03.268
But I want you
to be sure.

37:03.319 --> 37:06.155
Why shouldn't I?

37:06.239 --> 37:07.372
Because we're cops.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.657
All right?

37:08.742 --> 37:10.776
And if the line blurs
between us and them,

37:10.827 --> 37:13.212
what it is that we do
stops making sense.

37:13.279 --> 37:14.213
Do it.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.497
You'll be doing me a favor.

37:15.582 --> 37:16.548
Shut up!

37:16.616 --> 37:18.450
Eva,

37:18.501 --> 37:21.086
he's gonna pay
for what he's done.

37:22.505 --> 37:23.789
No.
Eva...

37:23.840 --> 37:25.924
No. No.

37:25.975 --> 37:26.759
For my people,

37:26.810 --> 37:30.429
for Luis, my brother Antonio--

37:30.480 --> 37:32.431
they deserved mercy!

37:33.683 --> 37:35.400
I got it.

37:36.853 --> 37:38.437
I got it.

37:38.488 --> 37:40.639
It's okay.

37:40.690 --> 37:42.474
(sobbing)
Okay.

37:44.327 --> 37:45.977
Come here.

37:53.253 --> 37:55.587
It's okay.
We got him.

37:55.655 --> 37:58.257
It's okay.

38:01.211 --> 38:02.978
I think I like
this Eva.

38:03.046 --> 38:04.162
Me, too.

38:04.214 --> 38:05.798
She rocks.

38:18.495 --> 38:20.011
It's my guardian angel.

38:21.514 --> 38:23.482
It protects me.

38:25.518 --> 38:27.319
And now it protects you.

38:30.690 --> 38:31.623
What about you?

38:31.691 --> 38:34.126
I found a better one.

38:53.062 --> 38:56.181
I'd call that
a connection.

38:56.232 --> 38:58.717
Brotherly-sisterly way, sure.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.901
(groans)

39:15.952 --> 39:17.953
Please tell me that's not
what I think it is.

39:18.037 --> 39:19.838
I think it is.

39:22.425 --> 39:25.210
Who's going to tell Sam?

39:25.261 --> 39:27.379
Technically,
he asked you to find it,

39:28.715 --> 39:30.682
so I'm just here for support.

39:30.750 --> 39:33.051
It was your motivational speech
that got us out here

39:33.102 --> 39:34.353
in the first place.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.054
Maybe this is a sign.

39:36.105 --> 39:37.055
What, that we both tell him?

39:37.106 --> 39:39.057
No, that neither of us tell him.

39:39.108 --> 39:40.309
Ooh.

39:40.393 --> 39:41.860
I mean, no good can
come from this, Nell.

39:41.928 --> 39:43.779
All right.

39:43.863 --> 39:47.733
What he doesn't know
doesn't hurt him. Agreed?

39:47.784 --> 39:49.267
Agreed.

39:54.073 --> 39:57.609
We never saw this.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.578
Saw what?

40:09.088 --> 40:11.223
The drone has been recovered,

40:11.290 --> 40:13.258
and Shallah and Molina
are in custody.

40:13.309 --> 40:15.477
DEEKS:
All is right with the world.

40:15.561 --> 40:17.813
Well, except for, uh...

40:17.897 --> 40:18.847
It's just a car.

40:18.932 --> 40:20.899
It hurts,

40:20.967 --> 40:23.685
but it's not
the end of the world.

40:23.770 --> 40:24.987
Fifth stage.

40:25.989 --> 40:27.072
CALLEN:
Acceptance.

40:27.140 --> 40:29.474
Yeah. Right.

40:29.525 --> 40:32.611
Delivery for Mr. Hanna,
outside.

40:47.627 --> 40:48.927
(taps box)

40:52.131 --> 40:54.132
They found her?!

40:56.803 --> 40:58.270
It's a pile of junk.

40:59.338 --> 41:01.807
With a copious amount
of potential.

41:01.858 --> 41:04.676
Look, the easiest way
to get over lost love

41:04.727 --> 41:06.228
is to fall in love again.

41:06.312 --> 41:08.513
You know,
it's not Charlene,

41:08.564 --> 41:10.181
but, uh...

41:10.233 --> 41:14.152
a little TLC,
it could be... Jennifer?

41:18.741 --> 41:19.691
You did this?

41:19.742 --> 41:21.994
Had a rainy day fund.

41:22.045 --> 41:23.578
It's L.A.,

41:23.663 --> 41:25.213
doesn't rain a whole lot.

41:29.669 --> 41:32.170
Come on.

41:38.928 --> 41:40.479
Whoo!

41:40.546 --> 41:41.763
(ignition sputtering)

41:41.848 --> 41:42.681
(engine starts, rumbles)

41:42.732 --> 41:44.349
DEEKS:
Have fun, boys!

41:46.319 --> 41:48.887
(engine rattles, rumbles)

41:51.274 --> 41:52.858
Well, there's
no chance

41:52.909 --> 41:54.826
anybody will steal that.

41:54.894 --> 41:56.611
Yeah.

41:56.696 --> 41:59.364
(chuckles)

41:59.415 --> 42:03.668
So... I guess you think
I owe you an apology.

42:03.736 --> 42:06.171
For what?

42:08.207 --> 42:09.574
For Eva.

42:09.625 --> 42:11.409
Oh.

42:11.461 --> 42:13.045
She wasn't entirely that bad.

42:13.096 --> 42:15.747
And I suppose there was
some modicum of attraction

42:15.798 --> 42:18.249
on her part,
albeit trauma induced...

42:18.301 --> 42:20.602
Shh.

42:24.090 --> 42:26.391
You had me at hel--
(screams)

42:26.442 --> 42:27.526
Okay, partners!

42:27.593 --> 42:29.194
Partners, partners,
partners, let go.

42:29.261 --> 42:31.396
Partners. Partners.
Aah! You can let-- aah!

42:31.447 --> 42:32.898
Walk it off.
Walk it off.

42:32.949 --> 42:35.200
Ow! Ow! Ow! Okay, I think you
just dislocated my finger.
