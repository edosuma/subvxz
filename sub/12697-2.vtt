00:03.658 --> 00:05.315
- I'm really glad we're doing
this show again.

00:05.522 --> 00:07.352
When we started,
we were just kids having fun,

00:07.593 --> 00:08.974
but now we can make
a real impact.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.148
You know, push culture forward.

00:10.389 --> 00:11.494
- Can you help me
take this off?

00:11.770 --> 00:12.253
- Yeah.

00:14.186 --> 00:15.877
There we go.

00:16.326 --> 00:18.052
Wow, you're already getting
a ton of likes

00:18.087 --> 00:19.536
on your bunny makeup tutorial.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.470
- I'm not doing this for likes.

00:22.505 --> 00:24.334
I'm doing this
to connect with people.

00:24.369 --> 00:26.095
To lift up, to inspire.

00:26.371 --> 00:28.580
It's not about me.

00:28.994 --> 00:29.926
But what are
they saying about me?

00:31.859 --> 00:33.757
- "Fire," "Straight fire,"
"That's lit,"

00:34.137 --> 00:36.933
"I love fire,"
"Burn everything"...wait.

00:37.589 --> 00:39.039
- Are there any
that aren't about fire?

00:40.212 --> 00:41.903
- Yeah, here's one,
but you know what?

00:42.111 --> 00:43.319
I'm not gonna read it.

00:43.353 --> 00:44.699
- What is it? Just tell me.

00:44.734 --> 00:47.426
- Don't freak out, but it looks
like your hater is back.

00:47.461 --> 00:49.566
- iHateCarly57.

00:49.773 --> 00:50.947
- There's always
gonna be haters

00:50.981 --> 00:51.982
that try to tear you down,

00:52.017 --> 00:52.949
but you know
what I say to them?

00:53.329 --> 00:55.607
I say,
"Mom, I'm doing my best!"

00:57.436 --> 00:59.093
- I can handle the haters.

00:59.128 --> 01:00.922
I've had haters since I was 12.

01:01.268 --> 01:03.546
But this person is relentless.

01:03.994 --> 01:06.721
They make fun of what I wear,
what I eat, what I drink.

01:07.481 --> 01:09.655
I'm starting
to second-guess everything.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.174
Do you think my walk is funny?

01:11.761 --> 01:13.280
- For a bunny or a person?

01:15.144 --> 01:16.662
- And the worst part is,

01:16.904 --> 01:18.285
at the end
of all of their comments,

01:18.319 --> 01:19.389
they say, "Do better."

01:19.424 --> 01:20.977
- Ugh.
- It's like, "Do better?

01:21.184 --> 01:22.358
How about you do better?"

01:23.186 --> 01:24.084
- At least
they're not threatening

01:24.118 --> 01:25.154
to break into your bedroom

01:25.188 --> 01:26.879
and braid your hair
like that other weirdo.

01:27.535 --> 01:29.917
- Yeah, but in all fairness,
that hair braiding Instagram

01:29.951 --> 01:31.194
is, quite frankly, spectacular.

01:33.714 --> 01:35.785
- Ooh, y'all doing,
like, a furry thing?

01:36.268 --> 01:36.924
- Yep.
- No.

01:37.269 --> 01:38.270
- Don't worry, I'm not here

01:38.305 --> 01:39.823
to kink-shame your fursona.

01:40.376 --> 01:41.549
- Hey, aren't you supposed
to be on a brunch date?

01:41.756 --> 01:43.586
- Oh, no, I didn't go.
He gave me the ick.

01:43.827 --> 01:46.347
- What's the ick?
- The ultimate turn-off.

01:46.382 --> 01:47.900
You can be
totally into someone,

01:47.935 --> 01:50.144
then you see one
bad improv show...

01:50.179 --> 01:51.835
- Or they're
way too into theme parks.

01:52.733 --> 01:54.114
- Or fiscal irresponsibility.

01:57.462 --> 01:59.360
- Listen to us.
We sound awful.

01:59.843 --> 02:02.018
There's just too much
negativity in the world.

02:02.605 --> 02:04.296
Which is why I'm going
to respond

02:04.331 --> 02:06.574
to this iHateCarly57 person

02:06.781 --> 02:08.507
with love and light.

02:08.542 --> 02:09.508
- Love and light?

02:09.543 --> 02:12.132
I'm more of a block
and report guy myself.

02:12.649 --> 02:14.617
- I'm going to embrace them,

02:15.169 --> 02:17.516
not physically,
but spiritually.

02:18.517 --> 02:20.174
Their profile picture's
the Space Needle,

02:20.209 --> 02:20.968
so they're local.

02:21.348 --> 02:22.349
Maybe we'll even meet up.

02:22.383 --> 02:25.386
- Yeah, nice afternoon
at the farmers' market,

02:25.421 --> 02:26.905

02:26.939 --> 02:27.630

To my olive branch.

Oh, I'll do better.

02:38.779 --> 02:40.712
I'll lodge that branch

a fake mustache?

03:34.110 --> 03:35.353

to just be at a coffee place.

I brought a taser
and some pepper spray.

18:58.551 --> 18:59.690
What is this--oh!

18:59.724 --> 19:00.277
No.

19:01.140 --> 19:01.623
No!

19:05.489 --> 19:07.698
Oh, I've done it again!

19:08.112 --> 19:08.768
- [sighs]
- Uh-oh.

19:08.802 --> 19:10.079
I know what that sigh means.

19:10.114 --> 19:12.254
- No, you don't.
- You miss Justin.

19:12.289 --> 19:13.048
- Oh, then yeah,
you totally do.

19:13.290 --> 19:16.155
- You want to keep dating him?
- Why not?

19:17.570 --> 19:19.192
I mean, let's face it,

19:19.227 --> 19:21.090
he still hasn't given me
the ick.

19:21.401 --> 19:24.163
And I'm no better than him
if I hold this against him.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.578
Life's too short
to hold a grudge.

19:25.888 --> 19:28.443
- And yet you won't forgive me
for that leggings incident.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.273
- You didn't tell me you could
see my whole butt through 'em.

19:31.308 --> 19:33.551
- I thought that's why
you bought them!

19:37.003 --> 19:38.418
- Ugh.

19:38.453 --> 19:40.109
I just wish
I could go back in time

19:40.144 --> 19:41.456
and tell 13-year-old me

19:41.490 --> 19:44.459
to put Justin on the show.

19:44.493 --> 19:45.149
Wait a minute.

19:45.425 --> 19:45.943
I can tell 26-year-old me
to do it.

19:45.977 --> 19:46.806
And she just agreed.

19:54.089 --> 19:56.988
- Freddie! Freddie?
- No.

19:59.267 --> 20:00.337
- Wha--come on.

20:00.371 --> 20:00.889
I just want to tell you
I love you, man, that's all.

20:01.683 --> 20:02.339
Also, I blinded myself again,
and I need you to be my eyes

20:02.684 --> 20:02.856
on a date tonight
with a gorgeous woman

20:03.443 --> 20:04.444
who just might be my soul mate,

20:04.479 --> 20:05.204
but it's hard to tell
because we only talked

20:05.238 --> 20:06.722
for five minutes
at the emergency room.

20:06.757 --> 20:07.620
But I'm a romantic.

20:07.654 --> 20:09.104
We'll see
where the night takes us.

20:09.932 --> 20:11.244
- You expect me
to fall for this again?

20:11.279 --> 20:13.073
- Yeah--no, there's nothing
to fall for.

20:13.108 --> 20:15.490
I really can't see.

20:15.524 --> 20:16.767
She's gonna be here any minute.

20:16.801 --> 20:20.046
- Think fast.
- Oh!

20:20.080 --> 20:21.220
- You might be
telling the truth.

20:23.325 --> 20:24.913
- That's my fault.
I deserve it.

20:27.191 --> 20:27.674
Can you help me up?
Oh, thank you.

20:30.712 --> 20:32.265
Now, listen,
this is embarrassing,

20:32.300 --> 20:35.337
but I have forgotten
hot eye wash lady's name.

20:35.372 --> 20:37.857
All I need you to do
is pretend to be my butler,

20:37.891 --> 20:40.308
dig through her purse, and look
at her driver's license.

20:40.342 --> 20:41.447
Your hands are really soft.

20:43.414 --> 20:44.450
You're not Freddie, are you?

20:49.524 --> 20:50.179
Oh!

20:50.214 --> 20:50.732
I remember now. It's Sarah.

20:50.939 --> 20:51.664
Sarah, hi.
What a funny--

20:52.423 --> 20:53.182
[sighs]
Are you there?

20:55.081 --> 20:56.634
- Thank you so much
for doing this.

20:56.669 --> 20:58.291
- I believe in second chances.

20:58.326 --> 21:00.259
I let Millicent
cut my hair twice.

21:01.398 --> 21:03.331
- I know it's no excuse,
but part of the reason

21:03.365 --> 21:05.229
why it hurt so bad
when you rejected my video

21:06.506 --> 21:08.543
is 'cause this piece
is really personal to me.

21:08.577 --> 21:10.545
- Well I'm honored that
you're sharing it with me.

21:11.339 --> 21:12.616
Is the camera ready, Freddie?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.032
- I literally
just press record.

21:16.896 --> 21:21.797
In five, four, three, two...

21:21.832 --> 21:23.247
- Welcome back to "iCarly,"

21:23.661 --> 21:26.699
where today, we have
a really special guest.

21:26.733 --> 21:29.011
Justin has had this prepared
for a long time

21:32.014 --> 21:33.740
and is finally
going to bare his soul.

21:33.775 --> 21:34.293
- We stan this vulnerability.

21:34.534 --> 21:34.810
- This is a poem that I wrote

21:35.604 --> 21:36.433
during a really difficult
period of my life.

21:36.847 --> 21:38.435
- Well, thanks so much
for doing it on the show--

21:39.056 --> 21:39.712
- Third period.

21:40.678 --> 21:42.335
[snapping]

21:42.370 --> 21:44.061
Homework.

21:44.095 --> 21:46.650
The bane of my exis...

21:47.823 --> 21:49.860
tence.

21:49.894 --> 21:50.757
Pudding cups.

21:52.483 --> 21:55.106
Reward for my persis...

21:57.695 --> 21:58.696
tence.

21:58.731 --> 22:00.595
Biology.

22:00.629 --> 22:01.630
Number one.

22:03.839 --> 22:07.395
Frustration.

22:07.774 --> 22:09.742
Hangry.

22:09.776 --> 22:13.090
Tater tots are my salvation.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.336
Prisoner of school.

22:20.304 --> 22:20.787
Life.

22:23.583 --> 22:25.861
Shh.

22:25.896 --> 22:27.415
- Oh...
- My...

22:29.865 --> 22:30.349
- Ick.

22:33.075 --> 22:36.320
[dance music]

22:36.355 --> 22:38.046
- Maybe "RuPaul's Drag Race"
can be my boyfriend.

22:40.289 --> 22:41.290
- [laughs]

22:41.325 --> 22:46.019
- [grunting]

22:46.054 --> 22:46.537
Oh. Hey.

22:51.542 --> 22:52.612
What are you doing here?
[laughs]

22:52.647 --> 22:53.164
- I live here.
What are you doing here?

22:54.303 --> 22:55.546
- Oh, you know,
I was just scaling the side

22:55.581 --> 23:00.240
of the building and noticed
your window was open, so boop.

23:00.275 --> 23:01.034
[laughs]

23:01.552 --> 23:03.796
- You scaled the building?
- Please don't tell my parents.

23:03.830 --> 23:05.349
They think
I'm at Cold Stone Creamery.

23:06.212 --> 23:08.456
- You still live
with your parents?

23:08.766 --> 23:11.424
That's so...normal.

23:13.668 --> 23:14.634
- I'm sorry.

23:15.324 --> 23:17.188
I hadn't thought
of you guys in ages,

23:17.223 --> 23:19.190
but then I got a taste
at the coffee shop

23:19.225 --> 23:21.676
and ten years of therapy
flew right out the window.

23:23.540 --> 23:25.024
- Look, I'm really sorry
to hear that, Nora,

23:25.058 --> 23:26.370
but you need to go.

23:26.612 --> 23:28.579
- [groans]

23:28.614 --> 23:32.549
Can I use your front door?
- Yes.

23:33.342 --> 23:36.484
- And can I take this?
- No.

23:43.422 --> 23:47.426
- Can I take this?
- No.
