<i>Previously on "The Mist"...</i>

00:02.125 --> 00:05.460
Every act of destruction
is an act of creation.

00:05.529 --> 00:07.829
That is why the Black Spring is here.

00:07.898 --> 00:09.130
If I see you touching her,

00:09.199 --> 00:10.780
I will put a bullet

00:10.827 --> 00:13.225
in whatever body part
you touch her with.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.370
- What can I do?
- Find me a room.

00:15.439 --> 00:18.640
- Hey! You can't do this!
- Watch me.

00:18.708 --> 00:20.053
What do you think they're gonna say

00:20.077 --> 00:21.677
when they know you have your own supply?

00:22.874 --> 00:24.273
Help!

00:24.342 --> 00:26.020
It was Alex. I saw her
running away from here.

00:26.044 --> 00:27.810
- No one could love you.
- Alex loves me.

00:27.879 --> 00:29.323
Until she finds someone
that can fuck her.

00:29.347 --> 00:31.414
- I did.
- Adrian, please. Please, don't.

00:31.483 --> 00:33.349
I'm sorry.

00:35.487 --> 00:37.020
Adrian, what happened?

00:37.088 --> 00:39.122
He's dead.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

01:38.750 --> 01:40.817
- Hold on. It's me. It's me.
- Where are they?

01:40.885 --> 01:42.096
Ththey're gone. Come on. Follow me.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.020
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:44.089 --> 01:45.986
Come on.

01:48.883 --> 01:50.883
Hurry.

01:59.572 --> 02:01.205
This way.

02:03.671 --> 02:05.011
- My God.
- Come on.

02:05.056 --> 02:06.288
Hurry. We have to get inside.

02:17.155 --> 02:18.521
Where is he?

02:18.590 --> 02:19.922
Where's who?

02:19.991 --> 02:21.190
Adrian.

02:21.259 --> 02:22.558
The kid I was with.

02:22.627 --> 02:24.527
He was in the car with your friends.

02:24.596 --> 02:26.095
Yeah, they all thought you were dead.

02:26.164 --> 02:28.297
You're lucky I wanted to stay behind.

02:31.603 --> 02:32.935
I have to go.

02:33.339 --> 02:34.905
I have to go now.

02:34.958 --> 02:36.183
I don't think you're
going anywhere, man.

02:36.207 --> 02:38.452
You've got a massive lump on your head.

02:39.038 --> 02:41.930
You don't understand.
That kid's a monster.

02:42.947 --> 02:44.313
He raped...

02:47.051 --> 02:48.918
He raped my daughter.

02:48.987 --> 02:50.820
I have to get to them.

02:56.461 --> 02:58.360
We should have checked just to be sure.

02:58.415 --> 02:59.540
Yeah, so we all could have died?

02:59.564 --> 03:02.127
I told you, it was too late.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.266
Why'd he do it?

03:03.334 --> 03:04.934
Your dad?

03:07.230 --> 03:09.811
When I was 11.

03:10.034 --> 03:13.276
Some tinydicked jackass
beat my face to shit.

03:13.589 --> 03:16.854
He said faggots weren't allowed
on school grounds.

03:17.015 --> 03:19.615
When I got home, my mom freaked.

03:20.275 --> 03:23.307
She drove me to the kid's house

03:23.362 --> 03:26.232
and forced him to apologize.

03:27.427 --> 03:30.849
Then we got back home
and the fun started.

03:31.740 --> 03:34.592
My dad called me a pussy.

03:34.799 --> 03:37.466
If I was getting my ass kicked,

03:37.616 --> 03:40.280
there must have been a reason.

03:41.005 --> 03:43.372
Then he beat the shit out of both of us.

03:45.977 --> 03:50.813
This is just him trying
to finish what he started.

04:12.225 --> 04:14.264
There's half an energy bar
and some water.

04:14.615 --> 04:16.372
- Why bother?
- Excuse me?

04:16.440 --> 04:18.207
Feeding me.

04:19.043 --> 04:20.594
Why not just let me die?

04:20.951 --> 04:23.615
Because I'm not a sociopath like you.

04:25.058 --> 04:27.401
You either want me dead
or you let me go.

04:27.823 --> 04:29.901
Didn't realize you were
calling the shots here.

04:29.987 --> 04:33.722
Please. Just let me out of here.

04:34.826 --> 04:36.192
I promise to leave her alone.

04:36.261 --> 04:37.994
I can't trust you.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.088
- I care about her.
- Shut your mouth.

04:41.768 --> 04:44.166
I didn't touch her that night.

04:44.386 --> 04:47.371
You keep saying that.

04:49.685 --> 04:51.185
You're just like your father,

04:51.238 --> 04:53.542
always blaming others
for your own failures.

04:55.580 --> 04:57.546
That's one more thing
you're wrong about.

05:01.419 --> 05:04.453
He thinks I raped her, too.

05:07.859 --> 05:09.625
Father of the fucking year.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.243
If you're looking for pity,
look elsewhere.

05:25.606 --> 05:29.030
I never imagined
I'd feel so safe in a sewer.

05:29.247 --> 05:31.195
I'm glad you approve.

05:32.038 --> 05:34.523
You sure you know where you're going?

05:34.686 --> 05:36.452
This line goes all the way to the mall.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.272
Had to come down here once or twice.

05:41.491 --> 05:44.760
This guy, he had just robbed
one of the stores in the mall,

05:45.342 --> 05:47.858
stole a bunch of cash and shit.

05:49.162 --> 05:50.775
We looked at all the security tapes,

05:50.850 --> 05:54.022
but that guy just disappeared.
He wasn't inside the mall.

05:54.858 --> 05:56.497
So we searched the whole building,

05:56.596 --> 05:57.673
found the sewer line.

05:57.742 --> 06:01.300
Figured that's the way he went,
then I followed.

06:01.646 --> 06:03.713
Did you capture him?

06:05.292 --> 06:07.041
We heard him scream.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.891
Pundik and I, we caught up to him,

06:09.916 --> 06:11.541
asked him what happened.

06:11.589 --> 06:13.156
He saw a bunch of rats.

06:13.224 --> 06:14.891
He was terrified of them.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.326
They're incredible survivors, you know.

06:17.395 --> 06:19.262
Even through the worst of times.

06:19.330 --> 06:22.988
Yeah, and they carry the worst diseases.

06:23.094 --> 06:24.465
Can we keep moving?

06:24.527 --> 06:26.369
Humans carry diseases, too.

06:26.815 --> 06:28.779
It's the endless cycle
of life and death.

06:28.863 --> 06:31.754
You know what? I don't want
to talk about rats anymore.

06:31.952 --> 06:34.319
You're sure this
is what we're meant to do?

06:34.441 --> 06:36.779
You're not here to question Her path.

06:37.027 --> 06:41.422
We're only survivors, just like the rats.

06:54.353 --> 06:55.378
We have a problem.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.400
What's the matter?

06:58.304 --> 06:59.816
Shelley's dead.

07:00.237 --> 07:01.536
What?

07:02.300 --> 07:03.439
What happened?

07:03.508 --> 07:05.875
Gus found her body.
She was beaten to death.

07:06.768 --> 07:08.558
Do they know who did it?

07:08.826 --> 07:10.659
I heard them talking about Alex.

07:11.516 --> 07:13.382
They're blaming her.

07:15.379 --> 07:17.687
They're going to come after her.

07:17.755 --> 07:19.422
Where is she?

07:19.491 --> 07:21.157
She went out to look for Jay.

07:21.977 --> 07:24.727
I'll find her. Then we need to leave.

07:28.768 --> 07:30.524
How are we going to get
anywhere without a car?

07:30.548 --> 07:32.016
- Nothing's working.
- Look for a map.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.236
We'll find the closest public building,

07:34.288 --> 07:36.522
and we'll make a run for it.

07:43.725 --> 07:45.520
We've got a full panic on our hands.

07:46.444 --> 07:47.944
I'm aware of that.

07:48.013 --> 07:49.613
Then what are you
going to do about Alex,

07:49.972 --> 07:52.115
other than hide up here?

07:53.585 --> 07:55.051
What are they saying?

07:55.120 --> 07:57.287
They're saying we need to find Alex.

07:58.213 --> 08:00.913
They're calling for her to hang.
They think she's evil.

08:01.374 --> 08:03.660
That's a bit of a stretch.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.495
You saw her kill a woman, right?

08:06.734 --> 08:09.532
- Yeah.
- Sounds evil to me.

08:09.601 --> 08:12.835
Now what do you want to do about it?

08:15.026 --> 08:17.409
Well, we can't have
a murderer walking around.

08:17.470 --> 08:18.915
Right.

08:18.977 --> 08:21.177
We'll send her out into the mist.

08:21.246 --> 08:23.179
Now what do we do about Eve?

08:27.094 --> 08:28.563
I don't know yet.

08:40.283 --> 08:42.857
Hey, you hungry?

08:44.160 --> 08:46.242
No, thanks.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.837
Why'd you stay?

08:58.836 --> 09:00.948
I found an old TV antenna
on top of the roof.

09:02.212 --> 09:04.463
Figured I could use it
to boost my radio signal.

09:04.526 --> 09:06.081
Then I found you.

09:06.986 --> 09:09.086
Glad you did.

09:11.602 --> 09:13.407
How long have I been out?

09:13.485 --> 09:16.290
Not long.

09:17.118 --> 09:19.102
I tried to wake you up
a couple of times.

09:19.170 --> 09:21.301
I read that having a concussion
and going to sleep

09:21.387 --> 09:22.939
isn't a good thing.

09:23.008 --> 09:24.407
I figured you needed it.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.199
I didn't see it.

09:30.309 --> 09:31.636
What was inside of him.

09:36.966 --> 09:38.655
We're about two miles from the mall.

09:40.692 --> 09:42.058
We can make it.

09:42.565 --> 09:44.127
How?

09:44.721 --> 09:46.295
Househop.

09:46.706 --> 09:48.665
Go four or five houses at a time,

09:48.846 --> 09:50.833
break in, wait for it to thin out.

09:51.101 --> 09:52.602
That'll take forever.

09:54.351 --> 09:56.105
It'll take as long as it takes.

10:24.315 --> 10:26.015
You okay?

10:26.555 --> 10:27.977
How do you want to do this?

10:28.038 --> 10:29.838
We avoid the people inside.

10:30.024 --> 10:32.384
From what that Vic guy said,
we don't want any part of that.

10:32.436 --> 10:34.793
I'll find them.
You guys can do a supply run.

10:34.974 --> 10:36.895
You shouldn't go alone. Right?

10:36.948 --> 10:38.648
He's just a kid.

10:38.717 --> 10:41.451
Sorry to remind you, but
you guys are escaped convicts.

10:42.031 --> 10:44.520
- If I get caught, I have an excuse.
- What's that?

10:44.589 --> 10:47.156
My parents are dead,
and I have nowhere else to go.

10:53.599 --> 10:56.116
So you wanna break the lock
or is it my turn?

10:56.201 --> 10:58.134
I've got this.

11:18.486 --> 11:19.819
Are you sure?

11:19.895 --> 11:21.023
I'm sure.

11:24.295 --> 11:26.847
I hate this place.

11:27.198 --> 11:29.165
Let's go shopping.

11:38.371 --> 11:39.637
Ready?

11:39.686 --> 11:41.385
Yeah, just grabbing a few things.

11:41.446 --> 11:43.713
Always be prepared or whatever.

12:07.438 --> 12:09.071
Come on, come on, come on.

12:09.140 --> 12:10.640
Go, go, go, go, go.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.662
Well, maybe three houses at a time

12:27.701 --> 12:30.059
is more conducive
to our athletic prowess.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.068
Everything happened so fast.

12:50.827 --> 12:55.249
My dad... he came after me.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.831
Kevin...

12:59.743 --> 13:01.759
he jumped in the way.

13:09.087 --> 13:11.520
It was my idea to check on him.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.082
We shouldn't have even been there.

13:14.152 --> 13:16.597
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:22.549 --> 13:25.831
And all I wanted to do
after it happened was find you

13:26.272 --> 13:30.408
to make sure you were okay...

13:31.799 --> 13:34.775
because we're... we're family.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.178
Hello?

14:13.029 --> 14:15.327
Alex, we have to go.

14:15.397 --> 14:16.821
What? Go where?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.001
The other group, they're
blaming you for Shelley's death.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.919
Shelley's dead? Wait, I don't understand.

14:20.958 --> 14:22.062
- Why would they?
- Shh.

14:22.091 --> 14:23.661
They're looking for someone to blame.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.482
What are we gonna do?

14:25.598 --> 14:28.866
We need to hide until we can
figure out a way out of here.

14:29.020 --> 14:31.036
You can't be out in the open.

14:51.515 --> 14:52.598
Trevor!

14:52.726 --> 14:56.483
Help! Help. Ursula.

14:57.009 --> 14:59.410
It's okay. It's okay.
We'll come get you.

15:02.719 --> 15:04.609
We need to climb down.

15:06.852 --> 15:08.452
We can't carry him.

15:08.521 --> 15:10.921
What are you waiting for?
We need to go get him.

15:10.990 --> 15:12.656
I think Trevor's journey ends here.

15:14.226 --> 15:16.093
You want to leave him?

15:16.162 --> 15:18.128
After everything we've done for you?

15:18.197 --> 15:19.396
Help me.

15:22.702 --> 15:25.703
Connor, please, please help us.

15:26.018 --> 15:27.404
Help.

15:28.490 --> 15:31.060
- Ursula.
- Listen to me.

15:31.482 --> 15:33.944
I will climb down there myself.

15:34.013 --> 15:35.334
I'll help him back up.

15:35.397 --> 15:37.522
Ursula, we can't carry him
all the way there.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.116
Then we will get help.

15:39.185 --> 15:41.666
When a gazelle is injured,
the herd moves on.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.824
Otherwise they'd be eaten by predators.

15:43.886 --> 15:46.183
My husband is not an animal.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.237
That's where you're wrong.

15:48.346 --> 15:50.861
Don't you see?
He'll become part of the circle.

15:51.445 --> 15:53.073
Connor, please.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.465
We should move on.

15:54.533 --> 15:57.635
You crazy bitch!
You can't do this to him!

15:57.961 --> 16:00.148
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's enough. That's enough.

16:00.172 --> 16:01.839
She is insane.

16:01.907 --> 16:03.340
We all believed in her,

16:03.409 --> 16:05.009
and now she's just going to abandon him?

16:11.062 --> 16:12.116
It's okay, Ursula.

16:12.184 --> 16:14.985
It's okay, it's okay.

16:15.054 --> 16:16.320
Okay.

16:16.389 --> 16:18.389
I'm not gonna abandon anyone.

16:18.457 --> 16:20.891
- Okay.
- It's okay.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.060
You should be with your husband.

16:23.129 --> 16:24.662
Okay.

16:33.399 --> 16:35.299
No, don't do this.

16:52.391 --> 16:55.822
- Please, don't leave us!
- Don't leave us!

16:55.906 --> 16:57.672
Connor!

17:17.101 --> 17:18.701
Please!

17:52.151 --> 17:54.393
I can't believe you're here.
How did you...

17:54.448 --> 17:55.919
I've been looking for you for days.

17:55.988 --> 17:58.121
Are you guys okay?

17:58.348 --> 17:59.890
We're okay.

18:00.849 --> 18:03.516
How did you get all the way here?

18:05.698 --> 18:07.131
I...

18:09.653 --> 18:12.469
Adrian, what happened?

18:13.434 --> 18:15.172
I was with Kevin.

18:15.794 --> 18:18.342
You saw my dad? Is he here? Where is he?

18:23.883 --> 18:25.315
He's dead.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.561
No, no.

18:39.554 --> 18:41.772
No, he can't be dead. He's not dead.

18:41.862 --> 18:44.264
No, no.

18:44.349 --> 18:48.662
I tried to save him,
but it was too late.

18:55.443 --> 18:57.242
How?

18:57.852 --> 19:02.114
My dad... he tried to kill me.

19:09.614 --> 19:12.520
I don't understand. Why?

19:13.232 --> 19:15.199
He hated me.

19:15.731 --> 19:18.313
You know how much he hated me.

19:20.519 --> 19:22.532
My mom was dead,

19:23.650 --> 19:25.986
and there was nothing to stop him.

19:26.743 --> 19:30.520
Kevin just got in the way.

19:34.302 --> 19:37.311
He was supposed to stay in the car.

19:38.290 --> 19:40.428
I'm so sorry.

19:43.045 --> 19:44.891
It's okay.

19:45.289 --> 19:48.594
It's okay. I'll protect you.

19:50.287 --> 19:51.928
- You look down...
- They're coming.

19:52.521 --> 19:54.188
We have to go.

19:54.271 --> 19:55.801
Baby, I'm sorry, but we've got to go.

19:55.870 --> 19:57.596
We've got to go. Come on.

20:13.285 --> 20:14.987
There's nothing here.

20:19.116 --> 20:20.729
You don't look too good.

20:20.895 --> 20:24.496
But I have a winning personality.

20:31.340 --> 20:32.574
Relax.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.566
Go on.

20:47.939 --> 20:49.390
What are we gonna do?

20:50.508 --> 20:51.956
Get out of here.

20:52.636 --> 20:54.193
Then what?

20:54.261 --> 20:55.961
Then we drive.

20:56.030 --> 20:57.839
Where?

20:58.818 --> 21:00.925
We'll find a place.

21:09.381 --> 21:11.781
Play a game with me.

21:12.413 --> 21:14.517
What kind of game?

21:14.874 --> 21:16.874
Close your eyes.

21:19.453 --> 21:23.280
You're in the mall,
but everything is normal.

21:24.174 --> 21:25.673
Mia...

21:26.811 --> 21:28.765
Everything is normal.

21:28.866 --> 21:30.218
Okay.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.397
We don't know each other,

21:32.601 --> 21:34.454
and I walk up to you

21:36.126 --> 21:37.976
and you look good.

21:38.087 --> 21:41.142
I look better, of course,
but you look good.

21:41.945 --> 21:44.536
I walk up to you, and...

21:45.598 --> 21:47.059
I take your hand

21:48.749 --> 21:51.811
and ask you what you want
most in the entire world.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.135
What do you answer?

21:56.545 --> 21:58.257
I want to know who I am.

21:58.815 --> 22:01.714
I tell you that you'll never know.
No one ever does.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.417
Then I whisper that...

22:05.721 --> 22:07.959
I just ran away from my boyfriend.

22:09.789 --> 22:11.602
Took his money.

22:12.977 --> 22:15.406
You don't have to feel bad. He was a...

22:15.859 --> 22:17.397
a drug dealer.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.977
A bad guy.

22:19.362 --> 22:22.104
Okay. Not feeling bad.

22:28.244 --> 22:30.711
And then I ask you
if you wanna run away with me.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.961
- What do you answer?
- Yes.

22:41.351 --> 22:43.400
I ask you where.

22:45.873 --> 22:48.611
Um, we go to...

22:49.710 --> 22:52.299
Iowa. Don't laugh.

22:53.303 --> 22:55.703
I want to be under the open sky.

22:56.610 --> 23:00.246
I don't know why,
but that's what I want.

23:00.781 --> 23:03.889
To see as far as my eyes reach.

23:04.524 --> 23:07.532
We get a house. Nothing fancy.

23:08.813 --> 23:12.610
I just want to watch the horizon.

23:14.538 --> 23:16.820
I wanna sit there with you

23:16.928 --> 23:19.546
and watch the horizon.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.470
Mia?

23:38.743 --> 23:41.313
If this thing stops,
will you go with me?

23:45.199 --> 23:47.282
I don't want to run anymore.

23:49.336 --> 23:52.094
I need to have a place to go.

23:54.675 --> 23:55.874
I'll go with you.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.733
I'm so tired of running.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.919
I just can't anymore. I'm so tired.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.153
- So tired.
- Hey.

24:13.206 --> 24:15.039
It's okay.

24:18.641 --> 24:20.328
You need to rest.

24:20.359 --> 24:23.268
- I'm okay.
- No, no, you just detoxed.

24:23.820 --> 24:26.032
You need to rest.

24:27.059 --> 24:30.709
There's a couch in the manager's office.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.793
Get some sleep, and I'll look for food.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.367
The door locks from the inside.

24:38.725 --> 24:39.891
You'll be safe.

24:39.951 --> 24:42.385
- And you?
- I've got a gun.

25:01.095 --> 25:03.195
I'll be fine.

25:23.896 --> 25:26.496
Any sign of Alex? Eve?

25:26.565 --> 25:28.098
Anything?

25:28.339 --> 25:30.108
This is a waste of time.

25:30.736 --> 25:32.369
You think they've gone?

25:32.648 --> 25:34.766
No, I mean this whole thing
is a waste of time.

25:34.828 --> 25:37.040
Why would Alex kill Shelley?

25:41.314 --> 25:43.022
Gus said he saw her.

25:43.515 --> 25:45.226
I know what he said.

25:59.231 --> 26:01.017
We're all clear. You should go to bed.

26:01.634 --> 26:02.866
Where are you going?

26:02.935 --> 26:04.401
Just have to grab a few things.

26:20.586 --> 26:22.524
What are you doing here?

26:25.891 --> 26:27.399
I didn't think anyone was in here.

26:29.962 --> 26:31.862
Got caught up in all the shit outside.

26:32.087 --> 26:33.352
Hurt my leg.

26:33.421 --> 26:35.154
Figured I could find some supplies.

26:42.695 --> 26:44.895
You okay? Do you need help?

26:44.957 --> 26:46.556
I'm fine.

26:46.601 --> 26:48.101
Thanks.

26:49.830 --> 26:51.490
My name's Wes.

26:53.552 --> 26:54.785
Jonah.

26:59.755 --> 27:02.693
You, traveling solo?

27:04.596 --> 27:06.258
Yes.

27:06.563 --> 27:08.391
Well...

27:10.486 --> 27:12.119
Good luck to you.

27:40.855 --> 27:42.637
Jesus.

27:52.858 --> 27:54.157
They're from Arrowhead.

27:54.195 --> 27:55.865
Maybe there's more of them.

28:01.168 --> 28:03.536
Put the radio down. Now.

28:21.174 --> 28:22.874
Is that what She wanted?

28:23.016 --> 28:25.157
You know it is. You can feel it.

28:27.781 --> 28:31.031
You did what needed to be done,
just like you always do.

28:32.913 --> 28:35.334
She won't forget your sacrifice.

28:37.567 --> 28:38.888
I wanted to please Her.

28:38.919 --> 28:40.700
You did, Connor. You did.

28:41.692 --> 28:44.576
You're a good boy, Her beloved son.

28:45.001 --> 28:46.396
You make Her so happy.

28:49.810 --> 28:51.684
Death supports life.

28:54.355 --> 28:56.755
You're helping life.

29:06.901 --> 29:08.701
Touch him.

29:14.241 --> 29:15.608
Do you feel his love?

29:17.517 --> 29:20.212
Through him, Mother Nature
shows you Her love.

29:23.954 --> 29:25.718
I feel your love, too.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.569
Are you with them?

29:45.713 --> 29:47.405
No.

29:48.958 --> 29:50.643
We're just trying to get to my family.

29:50.724 --> 29:52.111
Just put the gun down.

29:52.179 --> 29:53.523
How do I know you're telling the truth?

29:53.547 --> 29:55.482
I guess you don't, but I am.

29:57.357 --> 30:01.253
So either shoot me
or put the goddamn gun down.

30:09.664 --> 30:11.096
What happened here?

30:15.870 --> 30:17.555
I saw what they were doing,

30:18.506 --> 30:19.962
what they had done.

30:20.207 --> 30:21.895
- What do you mean?
- The Army.

30:21.959 --> 30:24.693
They were everywhere.
Everything was on fire.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.612
I don't know what's real anymore.

30:35.256 --> 30:37.356
- Is there anyone else here?
- Why?

30:37.425 --> 30:39.024
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Relax, relax.

30:39.093 --> 30:41.052
I just wanted to make sure
everyone was safe.

30:41.328 --> 30:44.833
My wife, she never
made it back from the store.

30:49.103 --> 30:50.103
No!

31:07.077 --> 31:08.601
I need you to let us leave.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.374
You'll tell them. They'll come for me.

31:10.429 --> 31:12.324
Look, I'm not gonna
tell anybody anything.

31:12.393 --> 31:14.513
To be perfectly honest,
I don't give a shit about you.

31:15.793 --> 31:17.406
Do you understand?

31:22.103 --> 31:23.699
I've always wanted to do that.

31:24.331 --> 31:27.316
All right, we need to grab
everything we can find.

31:27.488 --> 31:28.874
Guns, ammunitions, radio,

31:28.943 --> 31:30.706
anything that might be useful.

31:37.379 --> 31:38.912
Found something useful.

31:38.977 --> 31:41.727
If it's a military car, it might work.

31:56.462 --> 31:58.103
I'm sorry about your wife.

31:59.579 --> 32:01.118
They're gonna kill us all.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.884
I promise I won't
tell anybody you're here.

32:08.215 --> 32:09.681
I know you won't.

32:54.465 --> 32:57.366
No. No. No.

32:59.943 --> 33:02.093
No. No.

33:21.289 --> 33:22.539
Where did you go?

33:24.722 --> 33:26.078
Where did you go?

33:26.343 --> 33:28.343
Where did you go?

33:34.068 --> 33:36.202
Hey, kiddo.

33:37.405 --> 33:39.304
You left me.

33:39.398 --> 33:40.474
You left me.

33:40.499 --> 33:42.832
You left me, kid.

33:43.049 --> 33:44.560
You left me, kiddo.

33:49.203 --> 33:52.117
Hey, do you want to know
what the devil really looks like?

33:54.496 --> 33:56.129
The evil one is coming.

33:58.550 --> 34:00.817
He wants to see you.

34:02.330 --> 34:03.763
He's here.

34:20.606 --> 34:22.339
I see you.

35:23.231 --> 35:26.353
- What the hell happened to you?
- Just go. Just go.

35:38.934 --> 35:41.902
If there's a service exit,
it might lead to the parking lot.

35:42.244 --> 35:44.505
If we can get into a car,
even if it isn't working,

35:44.573 --> 35:46.507
at least it'll be safer
than staying here.

35:46.791 --> 35:49.565
My friends have a car. It works.

35:49.590 --> 35:50.644
What friends?

35:50.713 --> 35:52.848
We met them at the police station.

35:54.950 --> 35:56.283
Can you trust them?

35:56.352 --> 35:57.797
They didn't have to bring me here.

36:00.437 --> 36:01.977
Okay.

36:02.376 --> 36:03.775
Okay, come on.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.004
There! Right there!

36:16.138 --> 36:17.593
Eve! Stop!

36:22.750 --> 36:23.982
Down. Slower down.

36:48.648 --> 36:50.420
Come on!

37:07.256 --> 37:09.456
Mom! My mom needs help.

37:13.462 --> 37:15.128
Go, go, go, go!

37:17.433 --> 37:18.532
Come on!

37:40.639 --> 37:42.205
Good morning.

37:50.699 --> 37:52.232
What now?

37:57.402 --> 37:59.002
Let's stop this, Eve.

37:59.038 --> 38:01.308
Alex didn't do anything.
You have to know that.

38:01.377 --> 38:02.509
I saw her.

38:03.788 --> 38:05.479
Did you kill her?

38:05.946 --> 38:08.001
Is that why you're lying?

38:08.050 --> 38:09.683
Mom!

38:09.821 --> 38:11.837
Are you okay?

38:11.920 --> 38:13.987
- Who the hell is this?
- Who the hell are you?

38:14.056 --> 38:17.241
- Lock them up.
- Did you kill Jay, too?

38:17.452 --> 38:19.912
What? No. I didn't kill anyone.

38:21.130 --> 38:22.863
Is Jay...

38:22.931 --> 38:25.165
- Is he dead?
- No one has seen him in days.

38:25.234 --> 38:26.566
I haven't either. I swear.

38:26.635 --> 38:28.235
- Alex, just tell the truth.
- Come on.

38:28.304 --> 38:30.704
I am. I was looking for him
when all this started.

38:30.773 --> 38:33.092
- How convenient.
- Leave her alone!

38:33.999 --> 38:36.045
She doesn't know where he is,

38:36.645 --> 38:38.543
but I do.

38:41.065 --> 38:42.673
Move.

38:46.890 --> 38:48.476
Alex.

38:48.539 --> 38:49.655
Jay.

38:53.195 --> 38:55.128
Are you okay?

38:58.734 --> 39:00.400
Why?

39:48.558 --> 39:51.158
Are you ready for Her embrace?

39:53.188 --> 39:54.454
I am.

40:27.112 --> 40:29.104
What was that back there?

40:31.760 --> 40:33.660
A reminder.

40:39.101 --> 40:40.967
I'm gonna stay here.

40:41.670 --> 40:43.570
If that's cool, I mean.

40:45.130 --> 40:47.033
Keep an eye out.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.932
Do you know how long
we've been looking for you?

41:14.031 --> 41:16.265
Since before any of this happened.

41:16.820 --> 41:19.940
I've been here
with all these... civilians

41:20.187 --> 41:21.520
trying to make my way,

41:21.578 --> 41:23.844
and you just walk across my path.

41:26.225 --> 41:27.726
Do you...

41:29.001 --> 41:31.633
Do you really have no idea who I am?

41:33.417 --> 41:35.951
No. No, I don't.

41:37.525 --> 41:39.922
The captain's not gonna be
so happy to hear that.

41:40.189 --> 41:42.024
You know me?
