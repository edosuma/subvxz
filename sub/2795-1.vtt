<i>It has been said that
magic vanished from our world</i>

00:37.330 --> 00:38.665
<i>a long time ago,</i>

00:38.831 --> 00:42.710
<i>and that humanity can no
longer fulfill its desires</i>

00:42.794 --> 00:44.837
<i>through the power of wishes.</i>

00:45.004 --> 00:49.008
<i>To those who have lost the
wondrous vision of childhood eyes,</i>

00:49.133 --> 00:52.929
<i>submitted here is
the story of a little boy</i>

00:53.012 --> 00:55.431
<i>and a magical
Christmas wish</i>

00:55.515 --> 00:58.560
<i>that changed
his life forever.</i>

01:01.479 --> 01:06.150
<i>It began in 1985, in a
town just outside Boston.</i>

01:07.360 --> 01:12.282
<i>It was Christmas Eve, and all the
children were in high spirits.</i>

01:12.365 --> 01:14.450
<i>That special time of year</i>

01:14.534 --> 01:16.786
<i>when Boston children
gather together</i>

01:16.953 --> 01:18.705
<i>and beat up the Jewish kids.</i>

01:18.830 --> 01:19.998
Hey, Greenbaum!

01:20.290 --> 01:21.291
Uh-oh.

01:21.374 --> 01:22.375
Get him!

01:26.754 --> 01:30.425
<i>But there was one child who
wasn't in such good spirits.</i>

01:30.508 --> 01:32.260
<i>Little John Bennett,</i>

01:32.343 --> 01:34.512
<i>that one boy in
every neighborhood</i>

01:34.596 --> 01:37.307
<i>who just has a tough time
making friends.</i>

01:37.682 --> 01:39.225
Hey, guys, can I play?

01:39.309 --> 01:40.435
Get out of here, Bennett.

01:40.518 --> 01:41.561
Get lost, Bennett!

01:41.644 --> 01:42.604
Get out of here, Bennett!

01:42.687 --> 01:44.188
Yeah, Bennett,
get lost.

01:47.317 --> 01:49.694
<i>John longed
with all his heart</i>

01:49.777 --> 01:52.989
<i>for that one, true friend
that he could call his own.</i>

01:53.531 --> 01:57.285
<i>And he knew that if he
ever found that friend,</i>

01:57.368 --> 01:59.412
<i>he would never let him go.</i>

02:01.831 --> 02:06.210
<i>Well, as it does every year,
Christmas morning finally came.</i>

02:06.544 --> 02:10.548
<i>All the children were opening
their gifts with holiday glee.</i>

02:18.181 --> 02:20.058
<i>And for little John Bennett,</i>

02:20.141 --> 02:24.729
<i>Christmas Day brought a
very special new arrival.</i>

02:29.817 --> 02:31.611
Wow!

02:31.694 --> 02:34.405
I guess Santa paid attention to
how good you were this year, huh?

02:34.489 --> 02:36.407
Aw! Merry Christmas, John.

02:37.492 --> 02:38.618
<i>I love you!</i>

02:39.202 --> 02:40.620
He talks!

02:42.121 --> 02:44.374
I'm going to
name you Teddy.

02:46.501 --> 02:50.171
<i>John became
instantly attached to Teddy.</i>

02:50.254 --> 02:52.799
<i>There was something
about that bear</i>

02:52.882 --> 02:56.344
<i>that made him feel as if
he finally had a friend</i>

02:56.427 --> 02:59.806
<i>with whom he could share
his deepest secrets.</i>

02:59.889 --> 03:01.307
<i>I love you!</i>

03:01.933 --> 03:03.935
I love you, too, Teddy.

03:04.769 --> 03:08.564
You know, I wish you
could really talk to me.

03:08.731 --> 03:12.902
Because then, we could be best
friends forever and ever.

03:13.903 --> 03:16.989
<i>Now, if there's one
thing you can be sure of,</i>

03:17.073 --> 03:21.828
<i>it's that nothing is more
powerful than a young boy's wish.</i>

03:22.412 --> 03:24.539
<i>Except an Apache helicopter.</i>

03:24.622 --> 03:28.126
<i>An Apache helicopter has
machine guns and missiles.</i>

03:28.209 --> 03:31.879
<i>It is an unbelievably impressive
complement of weaponry,</i>

03:31.963 --> 03:34.924
<i>an absolute death machine.</i>

03:35.800 --> 03:37.552
<i>Well, as it turned out,</i>

03:37.635 --> 03:41.097
<i>John picked the perfect
night to make a wish.</i>

04:18.760 --> 04:19.969
Teddy?

04:23.806 --> 04:25.099
Teddy?

04:29.562 --> 04:30.646
Teddy?

04:39.071 --> 04:40.156
Hug me.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.576
You're my best friend, John.

04:43.868 --> 04:46.412
Did you...
Did you just talk?

04:46.496 --> 04:47.955
Don't look so surprised.

04:48.039 --> 04:50.124
You're the one who wished
for it, aren't you?

04:50.875 --> 04:54.337
Yeah.
I did wish for it.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.297
Well, here I am.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.425
You mean, we get to be
best friends for real?

04:59.509 --> 05:00.843
For real.

05:01.052 --> 05:02.303
Forever and ever?

05:02.595 --> 05:03.888
Sounds good to me.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.851
<i>John was just about
the happiest boy in the world</i>

05:08.935 --> 05:12.438
<i>and he couldn't wait to tell
everyone the good news.</i>

05:12.772 --> 05:15.566
Mom, Dad, guess what?
My teddy bear's alive!

05:16.901 --> 05:18.653
Really? Well, isn't
that exciting.

05:18.736 --> 05:21.113
No, Mom, he's really alive.
Look.

05:21.823 --> 05:23.658
Merry Christmas,
everybody.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.494
Jesus H. Fuck!

05:26.744 --> 05:28.204
Let's all be best friends.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.288
Oh, my God!

05:29.372 --> 05:31.374
John, get away from that thing.
Get over here right now.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.959
But, Dad...
Get over here!

05:33.251 --> 05:34.585
Listen to your father!
Come here!

05:34.669 --> 05:36.546
Helen, get my gun.
Dad, no!

05:36.629 --> 05:37.797
Is it a hugging gun?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.465
Helen, get my gun,
and call the police!

05:39.715 --> 05:42.802
I'm sorry, Mr. Bennett, I
didn't mean to scare anybody.

05:42.969 --> 05:45.054
I just wanted John
and I to be friends.

05:45.137 --> 05:48.599
Yeah, Dad, I made a wish last
night that Teddy was alive

05:48.683 --> 05:49.976
and my wish came true.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.437
Oh, my God!

05:54.689 --> 05:56.315
It's a miracle.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.777
It's a Christmas miracle.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.114
You're just like
the Baby Jesus.

06:03.698 --> 06:07.785
<i>Well, it wasn't long before
the story of John's little miracle</i>

06:07.869 --> 06:09.620
<i>was sweeping the nation.</i>

06:09.787 --> 06:11.038
Out of a Boston suburb

06:11.122 --> 06:13.916
comes what is, without a doubt,
the most incredible story...

06:14.083 --> 06:15.877
A young boy's stuffed animal

06:15.960 --> 06:18.588
has magically come to life for,
as yet, unknown reasons...

06:18.754 --> 06:23.342
Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did!
Look what Jesus did!

06:24.010 --> 06:27.555
<i>Before long, Teddy
had become a huge celebrity</i>

06:27.638 --> 06:29.056
<i>in his own right.</i>

06:34.312 --> 06:35.479
Hello, Teddy.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.403
You... you are a...
You surprise me.

06:43.029 --> 06:45.239
For some reason I thought you
were going to be taller.

06:45.323 --> 06:47.742
I thought you were
going to be funnier.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.789
<i>But through
all the fame,</i>

06:53.873 --> 06:57.960
<i>Teddy never forgot
his very best friend, John.</i>

06:58.044 --> 07:00.671
The thunder
can't get us, right?

07:00.796 --> 07:04.425
Nope, we're thunder buddies,
and the thunder knows it.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.010
We're totally safe.

07:06.969 --> 07:07.970
Teddy?

07:08.304 --> 07:09.305
Yeah, John?

07:09.472 --> 07:12.058
Do you promise we'll
always be together?

07:12.683 --> 07:14.101
I promise.

07:16.687 --> 07:19.023
Thunder buddies for life.

07:19.565 --> 07:22.151
Thunder buddies for life.

07:23.694 --> 07:28.574
<i>And that was a promise that
neither one of them ever forgot.</i>

07:29.533 --> 07:32.620
<i>So, where are
John and Teddy today?</i>

07:32.703 --> 07:34.789
<i>Well, let me
put it this way.</i>

07:34.872 --> 07:38.084
<i>No matter how big a splash
you make in this world,</i>

07:38.167 --> 07:42.088
<i>whether you're Corey Feldman,
Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber,</i>

07:42.171 --> 07:44.006
<i>or a talking teddy bear,</i>

07:44.090 --> 07:46.717
<i>eventually,
nobody gives a shit.</i>

10:20.246 --> 10:22.039
<i>Do I dare look
at the clock?</i>

10:22.414 --> 10:26.168
Look, all I'm saying is that
Boston women are, on the whole,

10:26.252 --> 10:29.630
a paler, uglier sort than women
from the elsewheres of life.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.382
That's bullshit. What about Lori?
She's hot.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.551
No, Lori's from Pennsylvania.
That's not a Boston girl.

10:33.676 --> 10:34.718
They're not that bad.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.138
See, the fact that you have
to say they're not that bad

10:37.221 --> 10:38.556
means that
they are that bad.

10:38.848 --> 10:40.933
Did you ever hear a Boston
girl have an orgasm?

10:41.016 --> 10:45.354
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!
Harder! Harder!

10:45.437 --> 10:47.356
Oh, God,
that was so good!

10:47.439 --> 10:50.651
Now I'm going to stuff my fucking
face with Pepperidge Farm!

10:53.362 --> 10:55.447
Jesus, this is weak.

10:55.614 --> 10:59.118
It's not even getting me high. I got
to have a talk with my weed guy.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.202
It's working for me.

11:00.286 --> 11:01.871
I think it sucks. I'm going
to have a talk with him.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.206
I don't know that you want to go
to a drug dealer with complaints.

11:04.290 --> 11:07.209
No. I know this guy a long time.
I've known him since 9/11.

11:07.293 --> 11:09.962
You remember? I was, like, "Oh, shit, 9/11.
I got to get high."

11:10.254 --> 11:11.839
Is it 9:30?
Yeah.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.465
Shit, I got to
get to work!

11:13.757 --> 11:15.259
I don't know
if I can drive!

11:15.509 --> 11:17.553
It's okay, I'll drive you.
I feel fine.

11:40.284 --> 11:42.286
Fuck!
Shit.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.412
Oh, man!

11:43.579 --> 11:47.082
Johnny, I'm sorry, man. That
car just came out of nowhere.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.626
God, is it bad?

11:49.710 --> 11:50.753
Oh, man!

11:51.295 --> 11:54.465
John! May I speak
with you, please?

11:54.548 --> 11:55.549
Shit.

11:55.633 --> 11:57.051
It's all right, go, go, go.
I'll pull out of here.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.344
Hi, Thomas, how are you?

12:12.191 --> 12:13.192
Asshole!

12:13.275 --> 12:15.736
That's my bad.
I was sending a tweet.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.907
John, it's almost 10:00.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.660
I know, sir, I'm sorry.
It wasn't my fault.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.662
What do you mean?

12:27.957 --> 12:31.335
I guess I wasn't really prepared
for a follow-up question.

12:32.253 --> 12:34.838
John, all you got to do
is not fuck up

12:34.922 --> 12:37.424
and you get my job when I
go to corporate next month.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.176
You're the new
branch manager.

12:39.260 --> 12:41.262
All you've got to do
is not fuck up.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.846
I realize that.
Good.

12:43.222 --> 12:44.890
Glad to hear it.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.727
Because in a month,
my life could be your life.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.772
A cushy, $38,000-a-year
branch manager

12:51.855 --> 12:54.942
who's personal friends
with Tom Skerritt.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.652
Not a bad life, is it?

12:57.194 --> 12:58.362
No.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.282
I'm going to show you something
that I don't like to show people

13:01.365 --> 13:04.118
because I don't want them
treating me differently.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.123
Boom.
That's me and Skerritt.

13:09.373 --> 13:10.416
Wow.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.126
Goddamn right, "Wow."

13:12.584 --> 13:14.128
I'm gonna dock you
for dinging the car

13:14.211 --> 13:15.671
and for showing up
late today, all right?

13:16.046 --> 13:17.923
Try and be a little more
responsible tomorrow.

13:18.007 --> 13:19.591
I will, sir, I promise.

13:21.010 --> 13:22.261
I'm not going to
let you down, Goose.

13:23.137 --> 13:24.138
What?

13:24.805 --> 13:25.806
<i>Top Gun.</i>

13:26.473 --> 13:27.516
So?

13:28.225 --> 13:29.226
Tom Skerritt.

13:30.144 --> 13:31.395
I know that.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.646
Get out of here, okay?

13:32.771 --> 13:33.814
Thank you, sir.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.817
All right, here's your keys,
your rental agreement,

13:36.900 --> 13:38.610
complimentary
map of Boston.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.238
Thank you for choosing Liberty.
Drive safely.

13:41.322 --> 13:43.073
Thanks.
Thanks so much.

13:44.575 --> 13:45.909
I heard you got busted.

13:46.744 --> 13:49.038
Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, man.
What happened?

13:49.288 --> 13:52.291
I don't know, I got fucking
wasted last night.

13:52.374 --> 13:56.128
My phone says I texted someone at
3:15, asking them to beat me up.

13:56.545 --> 14:00.257
And then, at 4:30, I texted the
same person saying, "Thanks."

14:00.466 --> 14:01.467
And you don't remember it?

14:01.675 --> 14:02.843
No, same as last time.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.095
It just seems kind
of gay, doesn't it?

14:05.596 --> 14:07.097
I don't know.
Maybe, yeah.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.600
Well, do you think you're part
of some gay beat-up underworld?

14:09.683 --> 14:11.685
Like one of those gay
beat-up clubs or something?

14:11.977 --> 14:13.520
I don't know.
I dig chicks, man.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.522
I don't remember any of it.
I was so fucked up.

14:15.606 --> 14:16.732
I might be gay,
I don't know.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.400
Do you mind covering
for me for a bit?

14:18.484 --> 14:20.027
I might go lay down
in the john.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.695
Hey, buddies.
Where is it hanging?

14:21.779 --> 14:23.364
Hey, Alix, what's up? You
get in the club last night?

14:23.572 --> 14:26.992
I didn't get in because
the bouncer was douche-face.

14:27.076 --> 14:28.452
But I made friends
in the line.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.828
That's good, I guess.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.539
Hey, guys, anybody
know a nice restaurant,

14:32.623 --> 14:33.624
like something
where they give out

14:33.707 --> 14:34.958
free bubblegum
in the bathrooms?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.168
For what?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.711
Lori and I have been dating
four years tomorrow.

14:37.795 --> 14:39.463
I want to take her
someplace really nice.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.256
Aw, congratulations, John.

14:41.382 --> 14:43.133
You guys have been
going out for four years?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.219
My longest relationship
was like six months

14:45.302 --> 14:46.762
and then she farted
in her sleep.

14:46.845 --> 14:49.598
I'm like, "I'm out of here, man."
I was gone before she woke up.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.809
You're not
very tolerant, huh?

14:52.142 --> 14:53.310
Lori ever fart
in front of you?

14:53.394 --> 14:54.436
Yeah.

14:55.521 --> 14:57.481
Really?
Yeah, many times.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.983
You Italian?
No.

15:01.402 --> 15:02.444
Why?

15:02.986 --> 15:04.530
Never mind.
Take her to Benihana.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.573
John, look, don't you
think after four years

15:06.657 --> 15:08.784
maybe she's hoping for
something more than dinner?

15:08.867 --> 15:09.952
Like what?

15:10.035 --> 15:14.039
I don't know, but if it were me,
I'd be expecting a proposal.

15:14.415 --> 15:16.667
Come on, nobody's expecting
anybody to propose.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.127
I mean, marriage isn't...

15:19.336 --> 15:21.839
Isn't love enough? I submit
that love is enough.

15:22.172 --> 15:25.008
You can put the ring in her
ass, let her fart it out.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.476
So bad, but so good.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.271
Hey, by the way,
don't let me forget,

15:37.354 --> 15:38.605
you and I got to
nail down a plan

15:38.689 --> 15:40.190
for the Bruins game
tomorrow night.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.484
No, I can't.
I'm taking Lori to dinner.

15:42.568 --> 15:43.569
For what?

15:43.652 --> 15:45.612
Well, we've been dating
four years tomorrow.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.114
Oh, fuck me. Nice.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.116
Let me ask you something.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.409
You don't think
she's going to be

15:50.492 --> 15:51.869
expecting something big,
do you?

15:52.286 --> 15:53.287
What, like anal?

15:53.370 --> 15:56.498
No, like a fucking circular
gold thing on her finger.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.293
Oh, fuck that! It's been
four years, Johnny.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.211
You and me have been
together for 27 years.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.214
Where's my ring?
Where's my ring, asshole?

16:04.298 --> 16:06.175
Where's my ring, motherfucker?
Stop it. Come on!

16:06.258 --> 16:08.594
Put it on my fuzzy finger,
you fuck! Come on!

16:08.677 --> 16:09.720
All right,
knock it off!

16:09.928 --> 16:11.096
All right,
I'm just saying.

16:11.180 --> 16:14.057
But do you think she might be expecting
me to make that kind of a move?

16:14.141 --> 16:17.436
No, I don't think she is. And, not
only that, it's the wrong time.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.980
It's a terrible idea. I
mean, you got the economy.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.065
You got the credit bubble,
the Supreme Court.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.192
I mean, look at Haiti.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.319
I guess I didn't
think about that.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.154
Well, that's...
It's a factor.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.739
<i>Who are you?</i>

16:28.989 --> 16:32.367
<i>Flash Gordon. Quarterback,
New York Jets.</i>

16:32.743 --> 16:34.912
This is the American
fantasy, right here.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.832
A professional NFL player is
called upon to save the world.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.043
Tom Brady could do that.
Tom Brady could do that!

16:42.252 --> 16:43.837
Hey.
Hey, sweetie.

16:43.921 --> 16:44.922
Hey, Lori.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.757
Hi.
Hi.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.008
What do you got there?

16:48.091 --> 16:49.134
Turkey burgers.

16:49.218 --> 16:50.260
Turkey burgers.

16:50.344 --> 16:52.971
Are we having homosexuals
over for dinner tonight?

16:53.597 --> 16:55.224
Ha-ha. No, just you homos.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.558
Whoa!
Whoa!

16:57.142 --> 17:00.270
You kind of just reworded my
joke, but, uh...

17:00.354 --> 17:01.355
How was work?

17:01.480 --> 17:02.648
It was fine.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.107
How's your dickhead boss?

17:04.525 --> 17:05.526
Rex is fine.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.403
He only hit on me once today,
so, it's a good thing.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.196
Hey, Johnny,
how about a beer?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.656
A couple of
Charles Brew-kowskis?

17:11.740 --> 17:13.534
Couple of Brew-stoyevskis?

17:13.617 --> 17:15.577
Maybe a Mike Brew-gaslowski?

17:15.661 --> 17:17.119
Perhaps a Tedy Brew-ski?

17:17.204 --> 17:18.204
That's a good one.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.666
You know what, I think I, too,
want a Martina Navrati-brewski.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.834
No, that doesn't work.

17:22.917 --> 17:23.961
Don't ruin it. No.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.420
Bullshit!
That totally works.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.505
No, no.

17:26.588 --> 17:27.964
Yeah, it does.
It doesn't work.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.383
The name has to have
a "ski" at the end of it

17:29.466 --> 17:31.885
and you just put "brewski" at the
end of "Martina Navratilova," so...

17:31.969 --> 17:33.762
I just thought we
were saying funny names.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.098
No, it has to have
a "ski" at the end of it.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.391
Otherwise,
where's the challenge?

17:37.558 --> 17:39.726
If there's no "ski" at
the end of the root word

17:39.810 --> 17:42.729
then we would just be
idiots saying nonsense.

17:51.989 --> 17:52.990
Hey.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.616
They found
the missing hikers.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.742
They did?

17:55.826 --> 17:56.827
Yeah.
What happened?

17:57.286 --> 17:58.537
They said
they got separated

17:58.620 --> 18:00.163
and one of them had his
foot stuck under a rock

18:00.247 --> 18:01.582
for like, five days.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.083
Wow.
Mmm.

18:03.542 --> 18:07.045
You know, if your leg got
trapped under a rock

18:07.129 --> 18:08.630
I'd chew it off
to get you free.

18:09.631 --> 18:10.591
You would?

18:10.674 --> 18:11.758
I sure would.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.302
Is that cannibalism?

18:13.385 --> 18:15.846
No, I think it's only
cannibalism if you swallow.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.097
Oh, yeah, no!

18:17.180 --> 18:18.932
Don't worry about that,
because I don't swallow.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.809
Really? 'Cause
that's not what I heard.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.937
Well, it's not true, okay?
I'm a classy broad.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.063
Yeah.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.441
I can see that.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.443
Listen,
speaking of classy,

18:29.526 --> 18:31.653
Ciao Bella is a really
expensive restaurant.

18:31.737 --> 18:34.615
So, we can go
anywhere else tomorrow.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.825
I really don't care,
as long as we're together.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.994
Are you kidding me?

18:39.077 --> 18:40.829
No, no, no. Four years,
we've been going out.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.206
I'm taking you to
the best place in town.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.417
You know I love you.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.337
I love you, too.
And you're nasty.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.464
Do you want to get nasty?

18:50.547 --> 18:52.591
You're a nasty girl.

18:57.846 --> 18:58.805
I don't understand.

18:58.889 --> 19:01.600
Thirty-five years old and you're
still scared of a little thunder.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.226
I am not!

19:05.729 --> 19:07.648
Thunder buddies for life, right, Johnny?
Fucking right.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.650
Let's sing the thunder song.
All right.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.903
<i>When you hear the sound
of thunder Don't you get too scared</i>

19:12.986 --> 19:16.573
<i>Just grab your thunder buddy
And say these magic words</i>

19:16.948 --> 19:20.285
<i>Fuck you, thunder
You can suck my dick</i>

19:20.410 --> 19:23.330
<i>You can't get me, thunder
'Cause you're just God's farts</i>

19:24.706 --> 19:25.707
Ugh!

19:27.125 --> 19:29.503
Hey, Lori, can you set
the alarm for 11:00 A.M.?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.296
I've got a lot of
stuff to do tomorrow.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.602
Good morning, Lori.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.396
Good morning.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.486
Okay. You okay
there, sweetheart?

19:54.569 --> 19:56.530
You look a
little flustered.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.656
I'm fine, I'm fine,

19:57.739 --> 19:59.908
I just didn't have time for
breakfast and the garage was full,

19:59.991 --> 20:02.160
oh, and that's right, my boyfriend
can't sleep through a thunderstorm

20:02.244 --> 20:03.453
without his teddy bear.

20:03.829 --> 20:05.539
I don't understand why you
keep putting up with him.

20:05.622 --> 20:09.292
Yeah, I mean, the guy's 35, and he's
working for a rental car service.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.211
You know, you guys,
it's really not about that.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.381
I don't care about that. I mean,
I'd love him if he was a janitor.

20:14.464 --> 20:18.009
<i>I mean, he has a huge
heart and we laugh a lot.</i>

20:18.093 --> 20:21.388
It's just a bonus that he's
the hottest guy in Boston.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.473
I don't know. I just wish he
would get his life together.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.976
Our life.
And he can't.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.562
And, I swear to God,
it is because of that bear.

20:28.729 --> 20:31.648
You should give him an ultimatum.
It's you or the bear.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.985
No, I can't do that.
That would devastate him.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.655
Besides,
what if he chose Ted?

20:38.989 --> 20:39.990
Well, hello there.

20:40.157 --> 20:42.242
Sorry if I'm interrupting
any private girl-talk

20:42.325 --> 20:43.785
about Channing Tatum's
index finger.

20:43.869 --> 20:46.079
But, Lori, I need to
see you in my office.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.415
Yeah, the thing is, Rex, I have a
lot of work I need to get to...

20:48.498 --> 20:51.084
Oh, this is work,
I swear.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.254
Great.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.339
Good luck.
Thank you.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.717
He's such an asshole.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.719
Out of control.
He's such a sleaze.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.764
A hundred bucks says he's showing
her the diving team photo.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.767
Check this out.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.186
That's me on
the high school diving team.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.146
We dove the shit out
of that pool that year.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.939
You promised me
this was about work.

21:13.064 --> 21:15.275
Lori, why don't you like me?
Ugh!

21:15.358 --> 21:17.402
I'm rich, I'm good-looking,
my dad owns the company.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.571
I have a boyfriend.
I have told you this.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.198
Yeah, the guy with the bear.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.367
But I'm talking about
a mature relationship, Lori.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.746
If we were together, our
babies would be spectacular.

21:27.913 --> 21:32.417
With my top-of-the-pyramid
Caucasian genes and your splash of

21:33.293 --> 21:36.755
dark, beautiful, smoky...

21:37.005 --> 21:38.840
Baltic? Czech?

21:39.007 --> 21:40.383
Goodbye, Rex.

21:54.648 --> 21:55.732
Oh!

21:56.024 --> 21:57.901
Okay, that was perfect.

21:58.109 --> 21:59.694
Would you like me to
wrap your leftovers?

21:59.778 --> 22:01.321
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.156
Actually, could you
wrap just this up for me?

22:03.240 --> 22:04.383
I want to scare
the shit out of somebody.

22:04.407 --> 22:05.408
Sure.

22:05.700 --> 22:06.660
What are you,
five years old?

22:06.743 --> 22:07.744
Yeah.

22:07.953 --> 22:10.163
But I read at a
six-year-old level, so...

22:11.581 --> 22:15.710
Sir, and madam,
here is your dessert

22:15.794 --> 22:17.754
and champagne.

22:18.088 --> 22:19.172
Ooh!

22:19.422 --> 22:20.757
Cristal.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.510
It's a special night. We've
been dating for four years.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.221
And hey, all those rich black
people can't be wrong, right?

22:29.766 --> 22:31.643
It doesn't feel like
four years, does it?

22:32.269 --> 22:33.603
No, it doesn't.

22:33.854 --> 22:37.148
You know, you had no business
being out on that dance floor,

22:37.232 --> 22:39.276
but I'm really happy
that you were.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.200
This song is so great.

22:47.284 --> 22:50.328
Oh, yeah. Chris Brown
can do no wrong.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.664
Wow, you can really move.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.958
You like that, huh?
Check this shit out.

23:01.631 --> 23:02.883
Oh, my God!

23:03.717 --> 23:05.051
Are you okay?

23:05.135 --> 23:06.344
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.596
No, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

23:07.679 --> 23:10.432
Jesus, I am so sorry. I didn't see you.
It was an accident.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.600
Did you hurt your head?

23:11.683 --> 23:13.310
Yeah, my head hurts a lot.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.978
Oh, man. Here, let
me get you some ice.

23:19.316 --> 23:20.317
Ow!

23:20.400 --> 23:22.944
Sorry, sorry.
Does it hurt?

23:25.906 --> 23:28.658
No. It's fine.

23:30.327 --> 23:32.996
Okay, here's a test to see how
much you actually care about me.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.624
You remember that night,
after the club

23:35.707 --> 23:39.544
we went and had late-night eggs
and waffles until about 5:00 A.M.

23:39.628 --> 23:42.589
We watched a movie on the
little TV in the diner.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.007
Name that movie.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.508
<i>Octopussy.</i>

23:45.717 --> 23:48.678
Baby! Gold star.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.056
And, by the way, my
dancing was not that bad.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.974
It was pretty bad.
I have cool moves.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.434
Yeah, so do people
with Parkinson's.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.769
That's not
how I remember it.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.187
Okay, how do you
remember it?

24:27.092 --> 24:29.052
All right,
whatever you say.

24:29.219 --> 24:30.512
Hey
Yes?

24:30.595 --> 24:31.930
Here's to four more years.

24:32.263 --> 24:33.932
Okay.
You make me happy.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.309
Now, I know we said
no gifts, but...

24:36.393 --> 24:37.394
We said no such thing.

24:37.477 --> 24:40.313
I got you something anyway, in clear
violation of the "no gift" rule.

24:40.397 --> 24:41.606
We had no such rule.

24:41.690 --> 24:45.110
Lori, I've wanted to give
this to you for a long time.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.531
John”.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.956
Those are the ones you like, right?
From that kiosk at the mall.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.583
Yeah.

25:02.627 --> 25:04.129
You know, Lori,

25:04.212 --> 25:05.630
someday, there's going
to be a ring in there.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.758
But I want to wait until I get
you something really special.

25:08.842 --> 25:10.677
I just don't have
the money right now.

25:12.470 --> 25:15.056
Look, I'm only saying this
because I love you.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.641
You're not going to
have any sort of career

25:16.766 --> 25:18.309
if you keep
wasting time with Ted.

25:18.393 --> 25:19.436
Oh, jeez, here we go.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.146
Baby, please ask Ted
to move out

25:21.229 --> 25:22.605
so we can move on
with our lives.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.233
Lori, look, he's been my best
friend since I was eight.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.943
I was not a popular child.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.321
You have to understand, I had no
friends before he came along.

25:30.405 --> 25:32.741
He's the only reason I ever
gained any fucking confidence.

25:32.824 --> 25:35.869
But you're no longer eight.
You're 35 years old.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.912
And unless you're
too blind to notice,

25:37.996 --> 25:39.914
he's not your
only friend any more.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.541
Can we talk about
this another time,

25:41.624 --> 25:43.043
and just enjoy
our anniversary dinner?

25:53.845 --> 25:55.388
Oh, shit, hang on a second.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.640
Now my phone fell under
the seat somewhere.

25:57.724 --> 25:58.767
Can you call it?

25:58.975 --> 26:00.185
Yeah.

26:14.532 --> 26:15.992
Is that my ringtone?

26:16.409 --> 26:17.827
Oh, yeah.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.413
What is it?
'Cause it sounds negative.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.415
No, no,
it's from <i>The Notebook.</i>

26:23.291 --> 26:24.334
Oh.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.586
This is going to take
some doing, I think.

26:26.669 --> 26:27.962
I'll just meet
you upstairs then?

26:28.046 --> 26:29.589
Yeah, I'll be right there.

26:37.639 --> 26:38.681
Oh!

26:38.765 --> 26:40.391
Lori, hey,
you're home early.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.102
What the hell is this?

26:42.185 --> 26:44.604
The ladies and I were just
watching <i>Jack and Jill.</i>

26:44.687 --> 26:48.608
Adam Sandler plays a guy and his
sister, and it's just awful.

26:48.691 --> 26:49.776
It's unwatchable.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.611
But, they're hookers,
so it's fine.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.197
This place is a wreck.
Who are these girls?

26:54.322 --> 26:55.907
Oh. Where are my manners?

26:56.074 --> 27:00.703
Lori, this is Angelique, Heavenly,
Cherene, and Sauvignon Blanc.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.122
I love you girls.

27:02.205 --> 27:04.707
You know, somewhere out there
are four terrible fathers

27:04.791 --> 27:06.835
I wish I could thank
for this great night.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.336
What is that?

27:08.545 --> 27:09.879
What is what?

27:10.380 --> 27:12.507
There is...

27:12.590 --> 27:14.509
...a shit on my floor.

27:14.759 --> 27:16.970
In the corner,
there is a shit!

27:17.220 --> 27:19.681
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we were
playing truth or dare

27:19.764 --> 27:21.599
and Cherene's
pretty ballsy.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.560
There is a shit
on my floor!

27:23.643 --> 27:28.565
"Or is the floor on the shit?"
is what Kierkegaard would say.

27:30.567 --> 27:32.944
Who lives here? I'm coming
to get whoever lives here.

27:33.194 --> 27:34.529
You owe me lobster money.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.489
That's
my buddy, Johnny.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.158
Not the lobster,
the guy running it.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.535
I found my phone.

27:40.618 --> 27:41.661
What's going on?

27:43.371 --> 27:45.582
Is that a shit?

28:01.097 --> 28:03.683
God, there are some
fucked-up fish out there.

28:03.933 --> 28:06.186
Look at that one.
WASP-y, white-guy fish.

28:06.269 --> 28:10.815
"I married the wrong woman, and
now I lead a life of regret."

28:10.899 --> 28:12.025
Oh, look at this guy.

28:12.108 --> 28:17.113
"I went to New York once in 1981,
and I just did not feel safe."

28:18.364 --> 28:20.575
Ted, you gotta move out.

28:22.493 --> 28:23.536
What?

28:24.078 --> 28:26.247
It's got to happen.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.959
What did I do?

28:30.960 --> 28:33.922
My relationship is at a very
delicate stage, you know.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.300
Lori and I may just need
a little space right now.

28:37.842 --> 28:40.720
Plus, a hooker took a
shit in our apartment.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.472
Oh, God!
Ah, what?

28:42.555 --> 28:43.681
Oh, this is so gross!

28:43.765 --> 28:45.767
Don't tell me! I don't want to hear about it!
Did you get it?

28:45.850 --> 28:47.727
No, I didn't get it!
Tell me when you get it!

28:47.810 --> 28:50.396
Oh, my God,
I got some on my thumb!

28:50.480 --> 28:52.815
No! You can never cook
with that hand again!

28:53.024 --> 28:54.734
Oh, my God! You have to
learn to cook left-handed.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.736
This is the most
disgusting thing ever!

28:56.819 --> 28:58.238
Don't!
Get it away from me!

28:58.321 --> 29:00.240
Look, that was a tough
night for all of us.

29:00.490 --> 29:04.035
Ted, you mean everything
to me, and so does Lori.

29:04.118 --> 29:07.080
I'm just trying to find a way
to keep you both in my life.

29:08.665 --> 29:10.541
She's making you
do it, isn't she?

29:11.125 --> 29:12.210
Yes.

29:12.293 --> 29:15.463
But that doesn't mean we can't hang out.
We'll hang out all the time.

29:15.922 --> 29:18.508
Yeah, but what about "thunder
buddies for life," Johnny?

29:18.591 --> 29:21.094
I know. I just don't
know what to do, here.

29:21.177 --> 29:25.139
I know it sucks, but otherwise
I'm going to lose her.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.808
And I do love her, Ted.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.060
I know you do, Johnny.

29:29.310 --> 29:31.479
I'll help you get on your
feet out there, I promise.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.856
I know. And we'll hang
out all the time, right?

29:34.023 --> 29:35.441
All the time.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.318
Fuck it. Bring it in. Come here.

29:37.402 --> 29:39.320
Bring it in, you bastard.
Come on.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.114
<i>I love you!</i>

29:41.364 --> 29:44.075
Fuck. Shit, sorry, that's
the thing from the...

29:44.242 --> 29:46.077
The old...
Yeah, yeah.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.578
I'm not gay.
I know.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.789
And you're not gay,
so we're fine.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.459
We gotta get you a job.

29:54.836 --> 29:55.920
I look stupid.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.213
No you don't.
You look dapper.

29:57.297 --> 29:59.674
I don't. I look like
Snuggle's accountant.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.050
Come on,
it's not that bad.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.510
John, I look like something
you give your kid

30:02.593 --> 30:04.095
when you tell him
Grandma died.

30:04.262 --> 30:06.139
Look, I know
it sucks, okay?

30:06.222 --> 30:07.265
But you've got
to make some money

30:07.348 --> 30:08.391
so you can pay
for an apartment.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.518
I don't want to work
at a grocery store.

30:10.601 --> 30:11.978
Yeah, but you
have no skills.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.147
I told you,
I can totally be a lawyer.

30:14.564 --> 30:17.483
You get the job, we're
celebrating after, okay?

30:17.942 --> 30:19.319
Uh-huh. And if I
don't get the job,

30:19.402 --> 30:20.737
are we still going to
smoke that pot?

30:21.070 --> 30:22.238
Probably, yes.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.324
Uh-huh. Okay, all right.
Good talk, coach, thanks.

30:24.407 --> 30:25.408
All right, buddy,
go get 'em.

30:26.409 --> 30:28.286
And don't worry,
I'll do my very best

30:28.369 --> 30:30.496
to get this job
that I so crave.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.166
So you think you
got what it takes?

30:33.333 --> 30:36.377
I'll tell you what I got. Your
wife's pussy on my breath.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.757
Nobody's ever talked
to me like that before.

30:40.923 --> 30:44.218
That's 'cause everyone's mouth is
usually full of your wife's box.

30:46.429 --> 30:47.555
You're hired.

30:47.805 --> 30:48.890
Shit.

31:34.852 --> 31:38.481
Well, I am a former celebrity
in a minimum wage job.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.317
This is how the cast of
<i>Diff'rent Strokes</i> feels.

31:41.401 --> 31:43.611
All day, every day.
Just awful.

31:43.694 --> 31:45.988
They must feel awful. The
live ones must feel awful.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.156
Come on.
It's not that bad, okay?

31:47.240 --> 31:49.700
I got a shitty job, and I
assure you, I am quite content.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.077
Excuse me.

31:51.244 --> 31:52.412
I'm sorry to bother you

31:52.495 --> 31:56.499
but my son and I couldn't help
but admire your teddy bear.

31:56.999 --> 31:58.418
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

31:58.501 --> 32:01.587
Yeah. I'm Donny,
this is Robert.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.507
I have to say, I've been following
you ever since I was a young boy

32:05.675 --> 32:08.344
and I remember seeing you
on the Carson show.

32:08.511 --> 32:09.846
You were just wonderful.

32:10.012 --> 32:12.348
Oh, yeah, that was
a weird interview.

32:12.432 --> 32:15.852
Ed thought I was ALF, and he kept
muttering anti-Semitic comments.

32:16.018 --> 32:17.979
He thought ALF was
Jewish for some reason.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.730
Have you ever considered
selling the bear?

32:20.022 --> 32:21.023
What?
Excuse me?

32:21.107 --> 32:22.316
I want it.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.652
I'm not an "it," pal.
I'm a "he," all right?

32:25.194 --> 32:27.155
I'm sorry, little guy,
but my bear isn't for sale.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.115
See, I've had him
since I was about your age.

32:29.198 --> 32:30.908
He's very, very
special to me.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.244
Stand up straight when
you're talking to me.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.288
Why the fuck
would he say that?

32:35.371 --> 32:38.374
Sorry, you really shouldn't
swear in front of children.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.209
Look, we're very
interested in the bear.

32:40.334 --> 32:41.919
If you want to make
some sort of arrangement

32:42.003 --> 32:43.713
here's my address
and phone number.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.132
And you can call me
any time, okay?

32:46.215 --> 32:47.258
Will do.

32:47.425 --> 32:50.303
Here it goes, in the really important
pocket for really important stuff.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.013
Okay? Okay.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.848
Okay.
See you later.

32:53.931 --> 32:54.932
Come on, Robert.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.017
Take it easy.

32:56.184 --> 32:57.226
What the fuck?

32:57.393 --> 32:59.353
Can you imagine what that
little shit would do to me?

32:59.437 --> 33:01.314
I could totally see him just
taking you down to the basement

33:01.397 --> 33:02.940
and really slowly
de-limbing you

33:03.024 --> 33:05.359
while singing some creepy
Victorian nursery rhyme.

33:05.735 --> 33:08.154
<i>Oh, my little sixpence
My pretty little sixpence</i>

33:08.237 --> 33:10.114
Stop it.
Knock it off.

33:10.198 --> 33:11.699
<i>I love my sixpence
Better than my life</i>

33:11.782 --> 33:13.659
Stop it! Fuck! Why you got
to take it to that place?

33:13.743 --> 33:16.287
You took it to a very... Now it's real.
Now it's a real thing.

33:16.370 --> 33:17.538
Come on.
Take it easy.

33:17.622 --> 33:20.583
All right, look, let's just find
a better place to get stoned.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.065
I guess this is it, huh?

33:44.232 --> 33:46.526
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

33:46.692 --> 33:47.818
First night on your own.

33:48.152 --> 33:51.280
Yeah, first night in
my beautiful new apartment.

33:51.906 --> 33:53.449
It'll be great
when it's furnished.

33:53.616 --> 33:55.993
Yeah, and the guy said it ain't
hardly had no murders in it.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.995
So, that's good.

33:58.829 --> 34:01.666
Okay, so,
if you need anything...

34:01.832 --> 34:05.461
Yeah, I know. Don't worry,
Johnny, I'll be fine.

34:06.337 --> 34:08.339
I know you will.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.257
All right.

34:35.992 --> 34:37.368
Hey there.

34:37.451 --> 34:38.494
Hey.

34:38.578 --> 34:40.161
Hi.
Hi.

34:42.498 --> 34:46.127
Listen, I just want
to say thank you.

34:47.043 --> 34:50.505
I know what you did
with Ted wasn't easy,

34:51.007 --> 34:54.427
and I just want you to know
that I love you for it,

34:54.510 --> 34:58.347
and I think it's a new beginning
for our relationship.

34:58.723 --> 35:01.434
Hey, anything for you.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.978
This is all part of the new,
grown-up adult John Bennett,

35:04.061 --> 35:06.731
so you better
get used to him.

35:06.814 --> 35:07.857
Really?

35:08.816 --> 35:11.027
Well, you know,

35:11.110 --> 35:14.780
I don't have to be at work
for another 20 minutes.

35:15.531 --> 35:17.158
Well, that's perfect.

35:17.241 --> 35:19.118
Because I'm only
going to need one.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.540
You know what my favorite
thing about you is?

35:24.874 --> 35:29.545
That, even after four years,
you can still surprise me.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.967
To step up and change such
a huge part of your life

35:35.051 --> 35:37.762
just to make your
girlfriend happier...

35:38.304 --> 35:40.890
I don't know, I guess most
guys wouldn't do that.

35:41.057 --> 35:44.393
Well, most guys don't have
you to motivate them.

35:46.771 --> 35:49.523
I know I'm not
a talking teddy bear,

35:50.775 --> 35:53.611
but at least you didn't have to
make a magical wish to get me.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.780
How do you know?

36:06.916 --> 36:08.000
Oh.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.002
Is that a Flash Gordon
ray gun,

36:10.086 --> 36:11.837
or are you just
happy to see me?

36:19.345 --> 36:20.846
There we go.

36:21.305 --> 36:25.142
Thank you very much, please come again.
We have a lot more groceries.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.692
Hey, Ellen.

36:32.775 --> 36:33.776
Yeah?

36:34.068 --> 36:35.111
Who's that over there?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.197
That's the
new checkout girl.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.949
Don't know her name.
Seems cute.

36:40.116 --> 36:43.202
Yeah, very cute. Do you know
what I'd like to do to her?

36:43.369 --> 36:45.204
Something I call
a Dirty Fozzie.

37:19.113 --> 37:21.615
Okay, all right, so that's
where we'll draw the line.

37:25.995 --> 37:27.580
Hey, how are you
holding up?

37:28.497 --> 37:31.792
Oh, I'm all right. I'm just getting
used to things, that's all.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.335
It's going to be all right.

37:33.794 --> 37:36.881
I actually went through something
like this with my last boyfriend.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.382
Really?
Yeah.

37:39.133 --> 37:43.012
We were together for eight
months, and I really loved him.

37:43.179 --> 37:46.056
And then he got
deported back to Iran,

37:46.140 --> 37:47.600
so I know what
you're going through.

37:48.017 --> 37:52.354
Oh, yeah. So, I guess we both
lost our furry little guy.

37:53.022 --> 37:54.064
We sure did.

37:59.695 --> 38:01.363
Hey, Ted. Hey, Johnny,
what are you doing?

38:01.447 --> 38:02.698
You want to come over
and catch a buzz?

38:03.199 --> 38:04.658
Well, I could probably
stop by after work.

38:04.742 --> 38:07.369
Fuck that I traded off yesterday
so I got the other shift.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.039
Come on, I'm bored as crap over here.
Just swing by for a bit.

38:10.122 --> 38:11.707
I cannot just
ditch work, man.

38:11.832 --> 38:12.948
Look, I'm trying to
get my shit together

38:12.958 --> 38:14.752
and be an adult here,
for Lori's sake.

38:14.919 --> 38:17.171
John, five minutes and then
I'll kick you out, I promise.

38:17.254 --> 38:20.341
Just come over. I got
the Cheers DVD box set

38:20.424 --> 38:21.967
and the guy down
at the store told me

38:22.051 --> 38:24.428
that everybody talks shit about
each other in the interviews.

38:25.554 --> 38:26.639
You'll kick me out
in five?

38:26.722 --> 38:29.141
I will kick you out in five.
John, I have to kick you out.

38:29.225 --> 38:32.728
I have so much teddy bear paperwork
I have to get to, it is sick.

38:32.895 --> 38:34.271
What do I tell Thomas?

38:34.355 --> 38:35.731
<i>Just tell him you
don't feel well.</i>

38:36.232 --> 38:37.983
I gotta cut out for a bit.

38:38.067 --> 38:39.443
Lori tried to
break up a dog fight

38:39.527 --> 38:40.861
and I guess she
got hurt pretty bad.

38:41.153 --> 38:42.196
Oh, my God!

38:42.279 --> 38:43.989
Yeah, that's
the way she is.

38:44.073 --> 38:45.533
She sees trouble and
she wants to help out,

38:45.616 --> 38:48.160
and I guess one of these dogs
clamped his jaws on her forearm

38:48.244 --> 38:49.995
and wouldn't let go
until the fireman showed up

38:50.079 --> 38:52.248
and stuck his finger
in his ass.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.041
Oh, Jesus.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.417
Yeah, she's
pretty shook up.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.336
Up the dog's ass, right?

38:57.419 --> 38:59.046
Yeah, up the dog's,
not the fireman's ass.

38:59.129 --> 39:01.549
I thought the fireman stuck his
own finger up his own ass.

39:01.632 --> 39:03.384
No, I don't think a
firefighter would do that.

39:03.467 --> 39:05.511
Go, take care of it.
Let me know how she is.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.096
Thank you.
Go.

39:10.391 --> 39:14.103
<i>Woody Harrelson. Smallest
dick I've ever seen on a man.</i>

39:16.480 --> 39:17.982
See, that's why
I watch these things.

39:18.065 --> 39:20.442
That's like a cool behind-the-scenes
thing that you wouldn't know.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.403
Oh, hey,
listen, try this.

39:22.486 --> 39:24.697
I told my weed guy to step
it up and he gave me that.

39:25.114 --> 39:26.156
What is it?

39:26.240 --> 39:28.659
It's called "Mind Rape."
It's actually pretty mellow.

39:29.118 --> 39:30.369
It doesn't sound
very mellow.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.371
Well, he only had
three other batches.

39:32.454 --> 39:33.747
"Gorilla Panic,"

39:33.831 --> 39:35.708
"They're Coming,
They're Coming,"

39:35.791 --> 39:37.585
and something called,
"This is Permanent."

39:37.668 --> 39:38.669
Go on, spark it up.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.720
There you go.
You got it.

39:49.013 --> 39:52.182
Nice. Good, huh?
Good job.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.227
Yeah.
Take pride in that.

39:55.728 --> 39:57.021
You know,
this place looks great.

39:57.146 --> 39:58.939
Thanks, man,
it's all IKEA.

39:59.023 --> 40:00.482
Did the whole place
for $47.

40:00.816 --> 40:02.401
Nice.
Yeah.

40:02.484 --> 40:03.944
How are the neighbors?

40:04.486 --> 40:06.447
You know, there's an Asian
family living next door

40:06.530 --> 40:08.741
but they don't have a gong or
nothing, so it's not too bad.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.659
That's lucky.
Yeah, it is.

40:11.035 --> 40:12.703
How's work?
It sucks.

40:13.329 --> 40:14.288
You?

40:14.371 --> 40:15.497
You know,
not bad actually.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.041
I met a girl.
She's a cashier.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.751
No way, that's awesome! Yeah.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.502
Well, we should fucking
double-date, or something.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.212
You, me and Lori,
and what's her name?

40:22.296 --> 40:23.797
White trash name.
Guess.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.342
Mandy?
No.

40:27.176 --> 40:28.344
Marilyn?
No.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.346
Britney? Tiffany?
No. No.

40:30.512 --> 40:31.597
Candice?
No.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.307
Don't fuck with me on this.
I know this shit!

40:33.432 --> 40:35.100
Do you see me fucking with you?
All right, speed round.

40:35.184 --> 40:36.393
I'm going to
rattle off some names

40:36.477 --> 40:37.603
and when I hit it,
fucking buzz it.

40:37.686 --> 40:38.896
I will tell you.
You got me?

40:39.063 --> 40:40.189
All right,
Brandi, Heather, Channing,

40:40.272 --> 40:41.482
Breanna, Amber,
Sabrina, Melody,

40:41.565 --> 40:42.733
Dakota, Sierra,
Bambi, Crystal,

40:42.900 --> 40:44.777
Samantha, Autumn, Ruby,
Taylor, Tara, Tami,

40:44.944 --> 40:47.196
Lauren, Charlene, Chantal,
Courtney, Misty, Jenny, Krista,

40:47.363 --> 40:49.156
Mindy, Noelle, Shelby,
Trina, Reba, Cassandra,

40:49.323 --> 40:50.908
Nikki, Kelsey, Shawna,
Jolene, Earline, Claudine,

40:51.075 --> 40:53.077
Savannah, Kasey, Dolly, Kendra,
Carla, Chloe, Devon, Emmylou.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.662
Fucking Becky?
No.

40:55.371 --> 40:57.873
Wait, was it any one of those
names with a "Lynn" after it?

40:58.082 --> 40:59.124
Yes.

40:59.208 --> 41:00.417
I got you, motherfucker.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.002
I got you. Okay.

41:02.169 --> 41:03.796
Brandi-Lynn, Heather-Lynn, Channing...
Tami-Lynn.

41:03.879 --> 41:04.964
Fuck!

41:08.509 --> 41:09.510
What the hell?

41:09.593 --> 41:11.804
Hey, man, you think you can
open more than one register?

41:11.887 --> 41:13.514
There's, like,
1,000 people here.

41:13.597 --> 41:15.808
There's supposed to be
three registers open.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.559
For God's sakes.

41:30.906 --> 41:33.575
Stick your finger
in the loop of my tag.

41:34.410 --> 41:36.996
You had sexual intercourse
with a co-worker

41:37.079 --> 41:39.915
on top of the produce
that we sell to the public.

41:40.082 --> 41:42.334
I fucked her with
a parsnip last week

41:42.418 --> 41:45.796
and I sold the parsnip to a
family with four small children.

41:46.588 --> 41:50.217
That took guts.
We need guts.

41:50.384 --> 41:52.094
I'm promoting you.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.930
You got a lot of problems,
don't you?

42:08.360 --> 42:09.486
All right, Kareem!

42:10.738 --> 42:12.614
Ah! You suck, Kareem.

42:19.163 --> 42:20.497
Hello?

42:24.376 --> 42:25.461
Huh.

42:29.006 --> 42:30.466
Hey, Ted.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.470
Hey there, fella.
How are you?

42:35.387 --> 42:36.847
Are you out here
all alone?

42:37.139 --> 42:39.141
Uh, no, no, I'm not.

42:39.850 --> 42:42.227
You know, you're never alone
when you're with Christ.

42:42.311 --> 42:44.605
So, no, I'm not alone.

42:44.688 --> 42:47.524
Yeah. Me, too.

42:50.611 --> 42:53.822
You know, Robert and I could
give you a very, very good home.

42:53.989 --> 42:56.200
Yeah, I'm pretty happy
where I am.

42:56.283 --> 42:57.659
I just got
a shitty new apartment...

42:57.826 --> 43:00.621
I can offer you
$6,000 in rail road bonds.

43:01.288 --> 43:03.207
Well, you know,
since I just returned

43:03.290 --> 43:05.000
from active duty
in the Civil War

43:05.084 --> 43:06.460
that actually
sounds very appealing.

43:06.543 --> 43:07.753
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

43:07.836 --> 43:11.006
That was 150 years ago
and I don't give a shit.

43:11.507 --> 43:12.716
Okay.

43:15.135 --> 43:17.846
Teddy, come on, we're going to be
late for dinner with your friends.

43:17.930 --> 43:19.431
Okay, be there
in a second, baby.

43:19.515 --> 43:21.767
As you can see, my dance
card is quite full.

43:21.850 --> 43:23.519
So, I'm going to
have to decline.

43:23.685 --> 43:24.978
Can I just get a hug?

43:25.354 --> 43:27.314
Oh, uh. No.

43:27.481 --> 43:29.024
Yeah.
No, no.

43:29.191 --> 43:32.194
And it kills me to have to tell you
no, because I'm a people pleaser.

43:32.361 --> 43:33.445
Yeah.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.489
Thank you for
creeping up my night.

43:35.656 --> 43:37.282
And Jesus be with you...
Okay.

43:37.366 --> 43:38.367
...in Christ.

43:39.993 --> 43:41.370
Who was that guy?

43:41.453 --> 43:43.163
That was
Sinead O'Connor.

43:43.247 --> 43:44.540
She don't look
so good no more.

43:49.545 --> 43:51.505
How great is this? The
four of us out to dinner.

43:51.588 --> 43:53.382
How long have we been saying
we were going to...

43:53.549 --> 43:56.260
Lori, how you doing? I haven't
talked to you in forever.

43:56.343 --> 43:58.137
I'm good. I'm good.

43:58.220 --> 44:00.806
The company's having their 20th
anniversary party next week.

44:00.889 --> 44:02.474
So, that's something.

44:02.766 --> 44:04.852
Lori's a senior VP
at a big, huge PR firm.

44:04.935 --> 44:06.687
It's not that
big of a deal.

44:06.770 --> 44:07.980
Company's turning 20, huh?

44:08.063 --> 44:10.107
So you can bang it,
but you can't get it drunk.

44:10.649 --> 44:13.068
Right?
Yeah, she gets it.

44:13.152 --> 44:15.529
She enjoys my humor.

44:16.113 --> 44:18.115
Yeah, Rex is having
a house party

44:18.240 --> 44:20.534
but I'm surprised John
didn't tell you, considering

44:20.617 --> 44:23.495
you two have seen each other every
single day since you moved out.

44:24.163 --> 44:27.416
You know, it's funny, because
whenever Johnny and I hang out

44:27.499 --> 44:29.751
the first item
on our agenda is,

44:29.835 --> 44:31.044
"What's going on
with Lori?"

44:31.211 --> 44:33.255
So, it's funny that
that didn't come up.

44:33.338 --> 44:34.508
That must have
slipped through the cracks.

44:34.548 --> 44:36.008
Yeah, but we do talk
about you all the time.

44:36.091 --> 44:37.885
Yeah, you remember the
other day, I was saying

44:37.968 --> 44:40.387
how great Lori's
hair always looks.

44:40.679 --> 44:42.639
Oh, my God,
it always looks so great!

44:42.723 --> 44:44.600
I always want to
fucking brush it.

44:44.683 --> 44:45.893
Right, Johnny?
I say that.

44:48.812 --> 44:50.314
So, Tami-Lynn,

44:50.397 --> 44:52.733
why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

44:52.816 --> 44:53.942
Like, where are you from?

44:54.026 --> 44:56.695
I'm always fascinated
to meet Ted's girlfriends.

44:57.112 --> 44:58.697
What do you
mean "girlfriends"?

44:58.780 --> 45:00.449
Was there a lot of them
or something?

45:00.616 --> 45:02.993
No, that's not what she meant at all.
Right, Lori?

45:03.118 --> 45:04.453
Lori, you didn't mean that.
No, no, no.

45:04.828 --> 45:06.622
What I meant to say
was Ted's very handsome

45:06.997 --> 45:08.624
so I'm always
interested in meeting

45:08.707 --> 45:10.542
the lady that
can snatch him up.

45:11.168 --> 45:12.377
Did you just
call me a whore?

45:12.461 --> 45:13.462
What?

45:13.629 --> 45:16.006
You just worry about your own
"snatch." How about that, honey?

45:16.089 --> 45:17.090
Whoa!
VVhoa! VVhoa!

45:17.174 --> 45:19.092
What the hell happened? We're
having a friendly meal here.

45:19.176 --> 45:20.260
This was a nice evening.

45:20.344 --> 45:21.386
Don't talk shit to me.

45:21.553 --> 45:22.930
I just asked you
a question.

45:23.013 --> 45:24.473
You know,
you're a freaking snob.

45:24.640 --> 45:25.891
You think you're
cool because you work

45:25.974 --> 45:27.601
at some fucking fancy
shit place, whatever.

45:27.684 --> 45:29.811
Okay, take it easy.
Nice, Lori, real nice.

45:29.895 --> 45:32.147
Me? It's not my fault
she can't speak English.

45:32.231 --> 45:33.357
Oh, fuck you!

45:33.440 --> 45:35.609
Just because you're on the business
world and shit you think, what,

45:35.692 --> 45:37.319
everybody should suck your
asshole, or something?

45:37.444 --> 45:39.738
Okay. All right, Tami, come on, honey.
Let's get out of here.

45:39.821 --> 45:42.115
We'll go back to my place for a
couple of vodka and strawberry Quiks.

45:42.199 --> 45:43.951
You know what?
I gave birth once, bitch.

45:44.034 --> 45:45.327
I could kick
your fucking ass.

45:45.619 --> 45:47.704
And you better never show your
face around Quincy, you hear me?

45:47.788 --> 45:48.956
Okay, come on.
Ever!

45:49.039 --> 45:50.666
I didn't know you had a baby.
Is it alive?

45:52.501 --> 45:53.669
What a cunt.

45:53.835 --> 45:55.462
Ow! I hate that word!

45:55.545 --> 45:56.630
What?
That word.

45:56.713 --> 45:58.215
It's so sharp,
it's like an electric sword

45:58.298 --> 45:59.424
slashing
everything in its path.

45:59.508 --> 46:00.759
Why would you say that?

46:00.842 --> 46:02.636
You didn't exactly
stand up for me.

46:02.844 --> 46:04.346
I'm trying to
walk a line, here.

46:04.429 --> 46:05.722
I want to be fair to you
and to him, you know?

46:05.806 --> 46:07.641
I think you're being a
little more fair to him.

46:07.724 --> 46:08.850
Oh, come on.

46:09.977 --> 46:13.355
You know, your boss called this
morning asking me how my arm was.

46:14.231 --> 46:15.232
Huh?

46:15.357 --> 46:18.527
Yeah, because of that dog fight
that I tried to break up.

46:19.278 --> 46:20.362
Oh.

46:20.779 --> 46:21.947
If I had to make a guess

46:22.030 --> 46:24.241
I would say that you made
up some bullshit excuse

46:24.324 --> 46:25.701
to get out of work
to go to Ted's.

46:25.784 --> 46:28.161
Now, am I right?

46:29.705 --> 46:30.872
I made you out to
be a hero.

46:30.956 --> 46:32.291
You know what, John,
we asked Ted to move out

46:32.374 --> 46:33.917
so we can give ourselves
a chance without him.

46:34.167 --> 46:36.044
You're not giving
anything a chance

46:36.169 --> 46:38.714
if you keep blowing off work to
get high with your teddy bear.

46:40.090 --> 46:41.717
You're right.

46:42.426 --> 46:44.511
I've been getting stoned too much.
I know that.

46:44.678 --> 46:47.931
I've been bumming around with Ted too much.
I know that, too.

46:48.015 --> 46:50.267
You give me one more chance,
I promise I can fix it.

46:51.351 --> 46:54.980
John, I need a man. Not a
little boy with a teddy bear.

46:55.063 --> 46:58.317
I know, done. Man. Right here,
in front of you, all right?

46:58.400 --> 47:00.986
Look at these pecs.
These are man pecs.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.530
Look at the hair on my upper lip.
That's man hair.

47:04.614 --> 47:06.575
I just farted.
That was a man fart.

47:13.749 --> 47:18.128
Fine, John, but this is, I swear
to God, your last chance.

47:18.587 --> 47:19.921
Trust me. I love you.

47:20.255 --> 47:21.590
All right, I love you.

47:21.757 --> 47:23.967
I love you so much. You
won't be sorry, I swear.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.261
Did you really just fart?

47:26.428 --> 47:28.513
Yeah, but I pushed it
that way with my hand.

47:29.431 --> 47:31.224
I wonder who it's
going to hit first.

47:31.308 --> 47:33.143
So, if I told him once,
I told him a million times

47:33.268 --> 47:36.104
these numbers do not add up.

47:36.188 --> 47:38.065
Who did this to us?

47:38.148 --> 47:41.568
God damn it!
I'm here on business!

47:45.655 --> 47:47.324
All right,
here we go.

47:50.619 --> 47:52.037
I'm really glad
that you came.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.372
Me, too.
Yeah?

47:53.455 --> 47:55.499
Is it okay if I
kick your boss's ass?

47:55.582 --> 47:57.542
That won't affect your
workplace chemistry, will it?

47:57.626 --> 47:59.211
Please play nice.

47:59.294 --> 48:00.462
For you, I will.

48:00.545 --> 48:02.005
Thank you.
Anything.

48:04.758 --> 48:07.427
There she is. I was worried
you weren't coming.

48:07.511 --> 48:09.930
Hey, squirt, how you doing?
Where's your bunny rabbit?

48:10.430 --> 48:11.431
He's a bear.

48:11.515 --> 48:14.935
Got it. Oh, my God! This
house is fucking huge!

48:15.018 --> 48:17.479
I know. Try not to get lost.
Come on in.

48:28.907 --> 48:30.992
Wow! Here
are the ladies.

48:31.159 --> 48:33.995
Look at you guys.
You guys look amazing.

48:34.162 --> 48:36.206
A little heavy on the eye
makeup, but pretty good.

48:36.373 --> 48:37.457
Thank you, Rex.
Thank you.

48:37.541 --> 48:38.583
You guys know
Lori and Jim, right?

48:38.667 --> 48:39.709
John.

48:39.793 --> 48:41.086
- You guys remember John.
- Hi.

48:41.336 --> 48:45.382
Listen, why don't John and I
go get a drink at the bar?

48:46.007 --> 48:47.050
Sure.

48:47.134 --> 48:49.594
Great, we'll be right back.
Come on, buddy.

48:51.012 --> 48:52.848
It's an old sweater, huh?

48:53.890 --> 48:55.934
This is Wade Boggs'
autographed bat.

48:56.017 --> 48:58.645
I just barely outbid Phil
Donahue for that at auction.

48:58.728 --> 48:59.771
Wow, cool.

48:59.855 --> 49:01.815
Yeah, cool.

49:01.898 --> 49:05.026
These boxing gloves were worn by
Joe Louis in his first fight.

49:06.069 --> 49:08.113
This is art.
Get it?

49:10.866 --> 49:12.617
These were
John Lennon's glasses.

49:12.701 --> 49:14.494
They're worth,
like, a million dollars.

49:14.578 --> 49:16.079
That's me
and Tom Skerritt.

49:16.371 --> 49:17.330
Oh.

49:17.414 --> 49:18.874
Check this out.

49:20.041 --> 49:22.210
It's Lance Armstrong's nut.

49:22.294 --> 49:24.045
I had it
freeze-dried and bronzed.

49:24.713 --> 49:26.173
Every now and then
when my life's

49:26.256 --> 49:28.467
getting me down
and things are tough,

49:28.633 --> 49:31.595
I just come up here
and I look at it.

49:32.888 --> 49:36.433
And it reminds me that
things aren't so bad.

49:38.310 --> 49:40.270
Sometimes you feel
like a nut.

49:41.229 --> 49:42.856
Sometimes you don't.

49:44.524 --> 49:48.153
So, talk to me, Johnny Quest. How
are things with you and Lori?

49:48.236 --> 49:49.738
Things are great,
actually.

49:49.821 --> 49:52.073
That's great.
That is great.

49:53.492 --> 49:56.119
You know, Lori would
hate me for saying this,

49:56.203 --> 49:58.413
but she told me how
you are at the office.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.248
And, as one gentleman to
another, I just want to say

50:00.332 --> 50:02.584
I really hope you fucking
get Lou Gehrig's disease.

50:06.087 --> 50:08.423
I think I need to clear
the air here a little.

50:08.590 --> 50:11.760
Yeah, I'm kind of a
fun-time boss and what-not.

50:11.927 --> 50:14.846
But, look, man, I do that
with everybody at the office.

50:14.930 --> 50:16.097
I'm a kook.

50:16.181 --> 50:18.225
I have no designs
on your girlfriend.

50:18.308 --> 50:20.352
We work together,
and that's it.

50:20.477 --> 50:24.272
I think you're a great guy
and she's a very lucky girl.

50:25.941 --> 50:27.234
Well, that's good to hear.

50:27.317 --> 50:28.527
Yeah.

50:30.487 --> 50:31.530
Excuse me.

50:32.405 --> 50:33.406
Hey, Ted.

50:33.490 --> 50:35.700
<i>Johnny, where are you? You
got to get over here, man.</i>

50:35.784 --> 50:36.785
Why, what's going on?

50:36.868 --> 50:38.203
Okay, so I'm having
a little impromptu thing

50:38.286 --> 50:39.621
with some people
at my apartment.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.998
And, John,
Sam Jones is here.

50:42.415 --> 50:43.416
What?

50:43.500 --> 50:46.503
<i>Sam Jones.
Flash-fucking-Gordon is here.</i>

50:46.586 --> 50:47.754
Holy shit! What?

50:47.837 --> 50:50.382
You remember I said my buddy's
cousin is friends with Sam Jones?

50:50.465 --> 50:51.883
My buddy's in town
with his cousin,

50:51.967 --> 50:53.802
and who do you think is with him?
Sam Jones.

50:53.969 --> 50:56.471
<i>Sam Jones is here,
and, John,</i>

50:56.555 --> 50:59.140
<i>his hair is
parted down the middle.</i>

50:59.641 --> 51:00.934
Just like in the movie.

51:01.017 --> 51:03.436
<i>Yes. Get over here
right now.</i>

51:03.603 --> 51:04.854
Fuck, I can't!

51:04.938 --> 51:06.815
I'm with Lori here.
I'm already on probation.

51:09.150 --> 51:10.277
I can't.

51:10.360 --> 51:13.738
John, Flash Gordon was the most important
influence of our formative years.

51:13.822 --> 51:16.199
He taught us right from
wrong, good from evil.

51:16.283 --> 51:18.076
And that the word
"acting" apparently

51:18.159 --> 51:19.911
has an extremely
broad definition.

51:20.078 --> 51:23.290
<i>Flash Gordon is the symbol
of our friendship, John.</i>

51:23.373 --> 51:25.500
<i>Come share this with me.</i>

51:26.459 --> 51:27.752
I'm coming.

51:28.295 --> 51:30.171
Rex, I got to go.

51:30.964 --> 51:33.216
I'll be back in 30 minutes,
tops, okay?

51:33.300 --> 51:35.844
But Lori cannot find out. She
absolutely cannot know I was gone.

51:36.344 --> 51:39.055
If you can cover for me, I'm
cool with all that other shit.

51:39.681 --> 51:42.058
I got your back on this. She won't know.
I've been there.

51:42.225 --> 51:43.768
All right, this is
one man to another.

51:43.852 --> 51:45.937
I don't really know you, but
I'm trusting you, as a man.

51:46.021 --> 51:47.063
This is serious.

51:47.355 --> 51:51.109
Dude, one man to another.
I got you on this.

51:51.276 --> 51:53.361
Thank you.
I'll be back.

51:54.863 --> 51:56.906
I'm going to have sex
with your girlfriend.

52:38.573 --> 52:40.367
Johnny, thank Christ
you made it.

52:40.533 --> 52:42.160
Dude, I got 10 minutes.
Where's Flash Gordon?

52:42.243 --> 52:43.244
Okay, get ready.

52:43.328 --> 52:45.747
Hey, Sam, this is the guy
I was telling you about.

52:53.254 --> 52:54.255
<i>Flash!</i>

52:54.881 --> 52:56.257
<i>A-ah!</i>

52:56.966 --> 52:58.593
<i>Savior of the universe!</i>

53:06.601 --> 53:07.602
<i>Flash!</i>

53:08.103 --> 53:09.270
<i>A-ah!</i>

53:09.938 --> 53:11.439
<i>He'll save every one of us!</i>

53:14.943 --> 53:18.988
<i>Just a man
with a man's courage</i>

53:20.281 --> 53:23.201
<i>He knows nothing but a man</i>

53:23.993 --> 53:26.329
<i>But he can never fail</i>

53:28.123 --> 53:33.461
<i>No one but the pure in heart
Can find the golden grail</i>

53:47.016 --> 53:48.643
How you doing?
Good to meet you.

53:50.019 --> 53:52.188
I thank you for
saving every one of us.

53:52.272 --> 53:53.314
Well, you're welcome.

53:53.690 --> 53:55.024
He acknowledged it.

53:55.191 --> 53:56.234
Let's do some shots.

53:56.317 --> 53:57.360
With you?

53:57.527 --> 53:59.529
Oh, my God, yes!
Oh, my God, yes!

53:59.612 --> 54:00.655
Let's go!

54:04.576 --> 54:05.618
Thanks, Flash.

54:05.702 --> 54:07.328
There you go, my friend.
Thank you.

54:07.537 --> 54:09.372
Death to Ming!

54:09.873 --> 54:11.040
Yes!

54:13.835 --> 54:15.378
You know,
you guys seem pretty cool.

54:15.545 --> 54:17.046
You like to party?

54:18.631 --> 54:19.674
Uh...

54:19.799 --> 54:20.800
Cocaine, right?

54:20.884 --> 54:23.678
Come on, dudes. Don't tell
me you never done it before.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.389
Not recently, no.

54:26.556 --> 54:28.308
I thought that was just
for people in Florida.

54:28.475 --> 54:29.684
You better follow me.

54:29.851 --> 54:30.977
Come on.

54:31.060 --> 54:32.687
Johnny, I'm frightened.

54:41.571 --> 54:44.199
We are going to
party like the '80s.

54:44.282 --> 54:45.450
Show us how, Flash.

54:45.533 --> 54:46.785
It's easy.

54:46.868 --> 54:49.245
We just gotta nail a lot
of girls named Stephanie.

54:49.329 --> 54:51.331
God, Johnny,
I got so much energy.

54:51.414 --> 54:53.208
We better start
doing stupid shit.

55:01.758 --> 55:03.051
Look, Johnny,
if we're ever going to

55:03.134 --> 55:04.344
get serious about
opening a restaurant

55:04.427 --> 55:05.428
we got to start
planning it now.

55:05.512 --> 55:06.721
Italian.
Italian, yes.

55:06.763 --> 55:08.473
What's the special on Tuesdays?
Eggplant parm.

55:08.556 --> 55:09.599
Chopped salad, half price.

55:09.682 --> 55:10.850
And it's
a non-restricted place.

55:10.934 --> 55:12.811
Yeah. What do you mean?
Anybody can come.

55:12.894 --> 55:14.312
Of course.
Jews are welcome.

55:14.395 --> 55:15.480
Well, yeah.
Why wouldn't they be?

55:15.563 --> 55:16.648
Exactly,
that's what I'm saying.

55:16.731 --> 55:17.816
Why even bring that up?

55:17.899 --> 55:19.123
You don't bring it up,
you just let them in.

55:19.192 --> 55:20.652
Why mention it?
No one will.

55:20.735 --> 55:21.778
Why are we
talking about it?

55:21.861 --> 55:23.358
You're talking about it. I'm
just saying, let them in.

55:23.404 --> 55:25.240
Let them in. Right. Okay.
Exactly. Good.

55:25.323 --> 55:26.324
No Mexicans, though.

55:29.410 --> 55:31.287
This is how everybody
sang in the '90s.

55:43.091 --> 55:45.134
Trust me, I can do this.
Shut up.

55:45.301 --> 55:46.469
Let him try it, man.

55:46.594 --> 55:47.804
All right, fuck it.

55:51.307 --> 55:53.268
Go, go, go!

56:01.776 --> 56:03.111
You son of a bitch!

56:03.194 --> 56:05.363
Well, you never should have trusted me.
I'm on drugs.

56:14.289 --> 56:16.124
Hey, Johnny,
I just had a great idea.

56:16.207 --> 56:18.626
Let's go get drunk and puke
on cars from the overpass.

56:18.710 --> 56:21.796
Come on, I do not sound
that much like Peter Griffin.

56:24.757 --> 56:26.885
You can do any '90s
song with just vowels.

56:33.933 --> 56:37.103
<i>A-E-I-O-U</i>

56:39.314 --> 56:42.483
See? There, proof. Garfield's
eyes look like a pair of tits.

56:42.567 --> 56:43.568
You were right.

56:43.651 --> 56:46.237
If you can punch through this wall,
you really are Flash Gordon.

56:46.404 --> 56:47.447
Are you going to do it?

56:47.530 --> 56:48.531
I'm going to
punch through it.

56:48.698 --> 56:49.991
Come on, Sam, do it!
Do it!

56:50.992 --> 56:52.994
Oh, my God!

56:54.412 --> 56:55.747
Yes! He did it!

56:57.165 --> 56:58.207
What the hell you problem?

56:58.374 --> 57:01.002
You break my wall!
I break you wall!

57:05.465 --> 57:06.466
Break his arm off!

57:06.549 --> 57:08.343
We're going to die.
We're all going to die.

57:08.468 --> 57:09.928
Break this up,
break this up.

57:10.011 --> 57:11.012
Get him!

57:12.221 --> 57:15.099
You break my wall!
This my home long time.

57:15.183 --> 57:16.976
You break my wall,
you bastard men.

57:17.060 --> 57:18.436
We're sorry,
it was an accident, okay?

57:18.519 --> 57:21.147
I try to make duck dinner,
now plaster everywhere.

57:21.230 --> 57:23.983
Chill out. Can we just talk about this?
What's your name? I'm John.

57:24.150 --> 57:25.610
My name is Wan Ming.

57:25.902 --> 57:26.945
Ming?

57:27.111 --> 57:28.863
You pay many dollar
for wall!

57:28.947 --> 57:31.658
This bullshit!
This all bullshit!

57:31.824 --> 57:33.826
Death to Ming!

57:57.433 --> 57:58.559
Rape!

58:01.270 --> 58:02.313
Sam, let him go.

58:07.819 --> 58:09.946
You crazy!
You crazy, man!

58:10.363 --> 58:11.823
Come on, James Franco.

58:14.951 --> 58:17.078
You pay for wall!

58:17.412 --> 58:18.913
Move, sucker!

58:36.639 --> 58:38.683
Greatest night ever!

58:49.527 --> 58:50.737
Hey.

58:51.029 --> 58:52.071
Hey, Guy.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.698
What's going on?

58:54.615 --> 58:57.035
This is Jared. He's the
guy who beat me up.

58:57.452 --> 58:58.953
And we're in love.

58:59.954 --> 59:00.913
Huh?

59:00.997 --> 59:03.833
Turns out I'm gay,
or whatever.

59:04.625 --> 59:05.668
I had no idea.

59:06.878 --> 59:10.048
Hey, Jared, let's go grab
another one of these.

59:13.593 --> 59:14.719
How we doing, ace?

59:15.219 --> 59:16.512
You coming down?

59:16.679 --> 59:18.514
Yeah, I don't feel so good.

59:18.681 --> 59:21.642
Give it a couple of hours.
You'll be golden, Ponyboy.

59:22.143 --> 59:23.436
You want a Xanax?

59:25.021 --> 59:26.230
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

59:26.314 --> 59:27.315
What?

59:28.483 --> 59:30.151
I got to go.

59:38.201 --> 59:39.243
Lori, I...

59:40.661 --> 59:41.829
Lori!

59:43.706 --> 59:46.000
Lori, wait, please.

59:46.876 --> 59:48.753
Look, I'm sorry,
I messed up...

59:48.836 --> 59:50.713
John, I need you out of
the apartment tonight.

59:51.172 --> 59:52.590
Can I... Just give
me the car keys.

59:52.673 --> 59:54.550
Can I please just explain? No.

59:54.759 --> 59:55.760
Look, I was...

59:55.843 --> 59:58.262
I have given up a huge
chunk of my life for you.

59:58.429 --> 01:00:01.057
I was going to stop in for like five
minutes and then Flash Gordon...

01:00:01.224 --> 01:00:03.184
Just give me
the car keys.

01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:14.821
Lori.

01:00:15.196 --> 01:00:16.739
Lori, please, I love you.

01:00:30.545 --> 01:00:33.256
Johnny, there you are.
I had to get some air.

01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:35.424
That guy from your office
is in there on the couch

01:00:35.508 --> 01:00:37.635
making out with that
Van Wilder-looking guy.

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:39.887
You know what? Fuck you. I don't
even want to talk to you.

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:41.806
What?

01:00:41.889 --> 01:00:44.142
Do you know
what just happened?

01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:46.602
Do you have any clue?
My fucking life just ended!

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.813
Come on.
She'll go home,

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:50.898
she'll watch Bridget
Jones-something-asshole.

01:00:50.982 --> 01:00:53.192
She'll have a good cry, she'll be fine.
You'll talk to her tomorrow.

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.027
Come on upstairs. Are you
even listening to me?

01:00:55.111 --> 01:00:57.238
Do you give any
shred of a shit?

01:00:58.406 --> 01:01:00.158
Of course I do, Johnny.

01:01:00.241 --> 01:01:02.118
"Thunder buddies
for life," remember?

01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:04.787
Jesus! Lori was right.

01:01:04.871 --> 01:01:07.248
I should have stopped hanging
out with you a long time ago.

01:01:07.415 --> 01:01:09.333
I'm never going to have
a life with you around.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.961
I'm 35 years old
and I'm going nowhere.

01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:15.506
All I do is smoke pot and watch
movies with a teddy-fucking-bear.

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:18.092
Because of that, I just
lost the love of my life.

01:01:18.843 --> 01:01:20.219
Johnny, I'm...

01:01:20.386 --> 01:01:21.512
I'm sorry.

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:24.015
I gotta be on my own, Ted.
I can't see you any more.

01:01:26.726 --> 01:01:28.853
John, wait. Listen.

01:01:29.228 --> 01:01:31.355
<i>I love you!</i>

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:34.043
So, word through the
grapevine is that you're

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:35.253
newly solo.

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:37.380
Rex, I have a lot of
work I need to get to.

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:40.800
I have tickets to Norah Jones
at the Hatch Shell tonight

01:02:40.883 --> 01:02:43.511
and I would love it
if you would go with me.

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:46.806
You're asking me out a week
after I broke up with somebody?

01:02:47.265 --> 01:02:49.433
Look, I'm going to
cut the shit, here.

01:02:49.517 --> 01:02:50.518
Please.

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:54.146
This is the first time
that you've been single

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:55.731
in all the years
you've worked here.

01:02:56.399 --> 01:02:58.985
Just go out with me
one time.

01:02:59.068 --> 01:03:00.778
And if you're miserable
and you hate it

01:03:00.861 --> 01:03:05.199
then I promise I will never
even hint at the subject again.

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:07.743
Please.

01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:09.453
Rex, I don't think
it's smart.

01:03:09.578 --> 01:03:11.706
I'm an asshole,
I know that.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:13.124
It worked for me
in high school,

01:03:13.207 --> 01:03:14.709
and it's been
a reflex ever since.

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.336
Lori,
the worst that can happen

01:03:17.712 --> 01:03:20.172
is that you go on
a fun, casual date

01:03:20.256 --> 01:03:22.300
with a guy who
just wants a chance

01:03:22.383 --> 01:03:25.886
to prove that he can be
something more than a jerk.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:28.306
Plus, you are a huge catch.

01:03:28.389 --> 01:03:30.433
And it's about time someone
treated you that way.

01:03:32.685 --> 01:03:34.687
Fuck it. Fine.

01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:37.064
Fine. It sure as hell beats crying
myself to sleep every night.

01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:39.358
And if that means
getting you off my back,

01:03:39.442 --> 01:03:40.776
well, that's just a bonus.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.320
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.455
Johnny. It's me.

01:03:52.872 --> 01:03:53.914
Go away.

01:03:54.248 --> 01:03:56.959
Johnny, open the door,
please, I want to talk.

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:08.721
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck, man?

01:04:08.888 --> 01:04:11.098
Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know
you're pissed, all right?

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:13.267
But just listen to me
for five seconds.

01:04:13.476 --> 01:04:15.644
I saw Lori leaving
the apartment with Rex.

01:04:15.728 --> 01:04:16.729
What?

01:04:16.812 --> 01:04:18.147
I'm serious, John.
I went over to talk to her

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.857
and maybe take some
of the heat off you.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.317
And there he was,
picking her up.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.735
They were going
to the Hatch Shell.

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:24.820
You're fucking unbelievable,
you know that?

01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:26.489
How stupid
do you think I am?

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:28.074
If you think that by
making shit like that up

01:04:28.157 --> 01:04:30.117
you're going to make me choose
some kind of loyalty to you

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:31.369
over her you're out
of your fucking mind.

01:04:31.452 --> 01:04:33.621
Johnny, it's the truth,
I'm telling you.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:35.623
You know what?
Get out of here.

01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:39.001
You know what? You're acting like a cock.
You know that?

01:04:39.168 --> 01:04:40.586
What? I'm acting
like a cock?

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:41.670
Yes, you are.

01:04:41.754 --> 01:04:43.756
So shut your meat hole for
a second and listen to me.

01:04:43.964 --> 01:04:45.466
Huh?
Meat hole? What?

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:47.093
That's not right,
is it? No.

01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:49.011
"Pudding hole"?
Is that what they say?

01:04:49.095 --> 01:04:50.179
No, it can't be
that either.

01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:53.682
Because, "How can you have any
pudding if you don't eat your meat?"

01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:56.018
Right? Pink Floyd.

01:04:56.185 --> 01:04:58.020
Look, the point is,
you're blaming me

01:04:58.104 --> 01:04:59.855
for something that
you did to yourself.

01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:01.732
Lori was right about you.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:05.528
You cannot take responsibility for
anything that goes on in your life.

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:06.737
Oh, and you can?

01:05:06.821 --> 01:05:09.073
I don't have to.
I'm a fucking teddy bear.

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:12.701
You know something? I didn't tie
you up and drag you to that party.

01:05:12.785 --> 01:05:15.746
I wanted you to come because
you're supposedly my best friend.

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:16.997
You can't stand there
and tell me

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:19.125
that you haven't always seen Lori
as a threat to our friendship.

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:20.584
It works out
so much better for you

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:21.961
when you and I are
getting fucked up

01:05:22.044 --> 01:05:23.295
on the couch at 9:00
A.M., doesn't it?

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:24.672
Listen to yourself.

01:05:24.839 --> 01:05:27.383
What am I? Emperor Ming,
here, controlling your mind?

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.135
That's your choice, John.

01:05:29.343 --> 01:05:31.053
And by blaming me,
you, you're just

01:05:31.137 --> 01:05:32.763
making yourself
look like a pussy.

01:05:35.391 --> 01:05:37.143
Sometimes I think back to
that Christmas morning

01:05:37.226 --> 01:05:38.394
when I was eight years old.

01:05:38.477 --> 01:05:40.187
I wish I had just
gotten a Teddy Ruxpin.

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:43.315
Say that one more time.

01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:46.610
Teddy Rux-fucking-pin!

01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:10.968
Shit!

01:06:15.222 --> 01:06:16.307
Fuck, man!

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.853
Ow! Fuck! Cocksucker!

01:07:04.188 --> 01:07:05.898
Fucking stop! Fuck!

01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:19.328
Why are you crying?

01:07:19.995 --> 01:07:23.290
My dick is squished
by the TV.

01:07:33.175 --> 01:07:34.969
I'm so sorry, Johnny.

01:07:35.177 --> 01:07:36.637
So am I, man.

01:07:37.179 --> 01:07:38.639
I love you.

01:07:38.806 --> 01:07:40.307
I love you, too.

01:07:40.808 --> 01:07:42.142
Listen.

01:07:42.685 --> 01:07:45.062
You got to let me help you make
things right with you and Lori.

01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:47.982
There's no putting things right.
She fucking hates me.

01:07:48.357 --> 01:07:52.069
No, John.
We can get her back.

01:07:52.278 --> 01:07:53.279
Look,

01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:56.407
you remember
when you were 10,

01:07:56.574 --> 01:07:59.201
and you hit that squirrel
with your BB gun?

01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:01.078
And then when we saw
it fall from the tree,

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:03.205
we both started crying,
you remember?

01:08:03.372 --> 01:08:04.707
And then we ran up to it

01:08:04.832 --> 01:08:09.003
and we tried to give it CPR,
and it came back to life.

01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:11.005
John, we could
do that again.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:12.131
Ted,

01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:14.967
we crushed its ribcage and blew out
its lungs trying to give it CPR.

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.218
It died.

01:08:17.428 --> 01:08:20.471
Come on. We're going
to the Hatch Shell.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.481
Yeah!

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:13.484
Thanks. We're going to take a short
break, but we'll be back in a few.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.243
Play <i>Chopsticks,</i>
you jazzy slut.

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:24.370
Teddy!

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:26.663
How are you?

01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:28.374
How are you doing,
you fuzzy little asshole?

01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:30.459
Well, I'm not a hot,
half-Muslim chick

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:33.087
who sold 37 million records,
but I'm hanging in there.

01:09:33.754 --> 01:09:35.171
Half-indian, but thanks.

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:36.256
Yeah, whatever.
Thanks for 9/11.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.341
Listen, I want you to meet a
good pal of mine, all right?

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:40.176
John Bennett, Norah Jones.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.845
Hi, Norah Jones.

01:09:41.929 --> 01:09:44.098
Hey, there, sweaty.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.017
You ready to
bring down the house?

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.270
Yes, ma'am. Thank you for
the opportunity, Miss...

01:09:50.354 --> 01:09:52.356
Ma'am Jones.
Thank you.

01:09:52.523 --> 01:09:54.108
Jesus, you look fantastic.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.694
Well, you're probably not used
to seeing me fully clothed.

01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:58.237
Yeah, I know, right?

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.949
Me and Norah met in 2002 at a
party at Belinda Carlisle's house

01:10:02.116 --> 01:10:04.493
and we had awkward
fuzzy sex in the coatroom.

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.662
Actually, you weren't so bad
for a guy with no penis.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.957
You know, I have written so many
angry letters to Hasbro about that.

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:13.752
Thank you.

01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:15.671
Now, I'm going to
give my chops a rest

01:10:15.754 --> 01:10:17.256
and bring a friend up
to the stage.

01:10:17.423 --> 01:10:19.550
He's going to sing a
song to a special lady

01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:21.802
in the audience
who he loves very much.

01:10:21.969 --> 01:10:24.888
Please give a big hand
to John Bennett.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.144
Oh, my God.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.104
Holy shit!

01:10:35.816 --> 01:10:37.651
I gotta fuck her again.

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:38.902
Uh...

01:10:38.986 --> 01:10:42.489
Hi, my name is John Bennett,

01:10:42.823 --> 01:10:44.825
and this is
for Lori Collins.

01:10:45.784 --> 01:10:46.994
Because I love you.

01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:52.332
This song always reminds me of the
most important night of my life.

01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:55.002
The night we met.

01:10:55.169 --> 01:10:59.006
This is the theme song
from the movie Octopussy.

01:11:03.761 --> 01:11:10.350
<i>All I wanted was a sweet
distraction For an hour or two</i>

01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:15.606
<i>Had no intention to do</i>

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:18.817
Still better
than Katy Perry.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:25.532
<i>Funny how it
always goes with love</i>

01:11:25.699 --> 01:11:29.244
<i>When you don't look,
you find</i>

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:33.332
<i>But then
we're two of a kind</i>

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.543
<i>We move as one</i>

01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:41.548
<i>We're an all time high</i>

01:11:41.924 --> 01:11:43.258
You suck,
get off the stage!

01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:44.885
Come on.
Give him a chance.

01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:50.474
<i>Doing so much more</i>

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:51.767
You're an asshole!

01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:53.644
<i>Than falling...</i>

01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:59.274
Oh, Jesus!

01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:02.528
Someone call an ambulance!

01:12:11.954 --> 01:12:13.539
That was insane.

01:12:13.622 --> 01:12:15.499
Did you see the way the
guy's body hit the ground?

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:17.209
He was like a rag doll.

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.586
Yeah, I'd rather
just not talk about it.

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:21.255
Do you want to go
get a drink after this?

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:24.258
I feel like I could use one
after seeing a guy almost die.

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:27.177
No, I think I'd
rather just have you take me home.

01:12:27.261 --> 01:12:29.179
One drink.
Come on.

01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:31.181
No, not really
feeling up to it.

01:12:31.265 --> 01:12:33.100
All right, I get it.

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:36.186
And, you know,
I don't blame you.

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:37.855
I mean,
when you think about it,

01:12:37.938 --> 01:12:41.191
it was actually really unfair of
him to embarrass you like that.

01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:44.862
Just to be clear,
I'm not embarrassed.

01:12:45.279 --> 01:12:48.073
Listen, John and I may have our
problems, but at least he tried.

01:12:50.242 --> 01:12:53.245
You know what? I don't feel
like talking to you about this.

01:12:53.745 --> 01:12:54.830
Where are you going?

01:12:54.997 --> 01:12:58.000
Taking a cab.
I'm going home.

01:13:02.296 --> 01:13:03.672
Finally.

01:13:14.808 --> 01:13:16.018
Down here.

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:17.769
Not looking up your towel.
Swear to God.

01:13:17.853 --> 01:13:20.355
Not looking up your towel. Not
looking at your funny business.

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:22.149
Ted, what are you
doing here?

01:13:22.983 --> 01:13:24.318
I need to talk to you.

01:13:24.818 --> 01:13:26.904
Listen, if you're here to fight
John's battles for him...

01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:28.864
Look, just let me
talk first, all right?

01:13:28.947 --> 01:13:30.824
And then you can
say whatever you want.

01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:38.916
Look, John
loves you very much,

01:13:38.999 --> 01:13:40.417
more than
anything in the world,

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.545
and he's falling to fucking
pieces without you.

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:45.964
He knows
he screwed up huge

01:13:46.048 --> 01:13:49.509
but you've got to believe me,
it wasn't all his fault.

01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:53.305
I told him to bail on you that
night at Rex's and he said, "No."

01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:57.392
He said "no," he was going to stay there
with you, and I twisted his arm, Lori.

01:13:57.893 --> 01:13:59.937
So, if you just give him
one more chance

01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:03.774
I promise I will leave
and I'll never come back.

01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:06.068
All right?
He'll be all yours.

01:14:06.944 --> 01:14:08.904
Ted, that's
a really nice offer,

01:14:08.987 --> 01:14:11.365
but I don't want
you to do that.

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:15.535
This is between John and me and
I don't think it can be fixed.

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:17.079
Yeah, because of me!

01:14:17.204 --> 01:14:20.457
Look, Lori,
you want him to be a man.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.459
But as long as
he's got his teddy bear,

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:24.670
he's always going to
be a boy.

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.466
He's waiting down
at Charlie's right now.

01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:33.220
So, if you go down there
and just talk to him

01:14:33.387 --> 01:14:35.222
I'll be gone
when you get back.

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:37.432
Forever.

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:40.811
And, you'll see,

01:14:40.894 --> 01:14:43.897
he'll never be
scared of thunder again.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:31.236
"Michelob Ultra
Tuscan Orange Grapefruit."

01:15:31.403 --> 01:15:33.697
My God,
America is imploding.

01:15:42.748 --> 01:15:43.790
Hi, Ted.

01:15:44.416 --> 01:15:45.459
Fuck!

01:16:04.686 --> 01:16:05.979
Lori, what...

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.522
Hey.

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:08.899
What are you doing here?

01:16:09.483 --> 01:16:11.318
You can thank Ted.

01:16:14.988 --> 01:16:17.199
Should I sit?

01:16:17.657 --> 01:16:19.701
Yeah, if you want.

01:16:19.951 --> 01:16:21.244
Okay.

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:25.040
So, work's good?
Everything good, there?

01:16:25.207 --> 01:16:27.709
Yeah. Yeah, work's good.

01:16:29.503 --> 01:16:32.047
I guess we can't make
small talk all day, huh?

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:37.052
If it's okay with you, I just
want to say what I want to say.

01:16:38.178 --> 01:16:39.721
I could sit here and
tell you I'm sorry,

01:16:39.805 --> 01:16:41.264
it was a huge
misunderstanding,

01:16:41.348 --> 01:16:43.892
and I'm ready to change,

01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:45.852
but I don't think you want
to hear any of that crap.

01:16:46.686 --> 01:16:49.022
I'm not going to try to
get you to take me back.

01:16:49.523 --> 01:16:50.565
Why would you?

01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:52.567
I've been a really shitty boyfriend
for the last four years.

01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:54.277
I don't deserve you.

01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:58.782
I know I didn't take our
relationship seriously but, Lori,

01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:00.700
I do love you more
than life itself.

01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:06.081
All I want is... I just
want to end on good terms.

01:17:06.164 --> 01:17:07.457
I owe that to you.

01:17:07.624 --> 01:17:10.043
I want you to be happy.
You deserve that.

01:17:10.877 --> 01:17:14.840
And I just hope that maybe
we can still be friends.

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:18.468
Thank you for
being so honest.

01:17:21.555 --> 01:17:23.515
That's pretty much it.

01:17:26.268 --> 01:17:27.394
Thanks for coming by.

01:17:58.884 --> 01:18:00.010
Whoa!

01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:05.682
Yeah, as you can see

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:09.102
you've been a part of our
family for quite some time.

01:18:10.937 --> 01:18:12.189
Welcome home.

01:18:12.272 --> 01:18:13.815
Yeah, it's kind of
funny, actually.

01:18:13.899 --> 01:18:16.276
I got a lot of pictures of
you guys at my house.

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:18.278
Is he all mine, Daddy?

01:18:18.904 --> 01:18:22.199
Yes, he is, my little winner.
Yes, he is.

01:18:22.574 --> 01:18:24.659
Ted, you've arrived
at a lucky time.

01:18:24.743 --> 01:18:26.494
It's almost
Robert's play hour.

01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:29.080
Yeah, I'm guessing you guys
don't have a PS3.

01:18:29.164 --> 01:18:32.042
I'm guessing you're more of a "wooden
horse with a wig" kind of family.

01:18:32.876 --> 01:18:34.461
Yeah.

01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:36.421
No. Yeah. No.

01:18:36.963 --> 01:18:37.964
Yeah.

01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:47.474
Yeah, see,
there's the guy.

01:18:47.766 --> 01:18:51.269
Now, Ted, you belong to Robert now, okay?
You do as he says.

01:18:51.436 --> 01:18:53.438
You think you're just going to
get away with a kidnapping?

01:18:53.605 --> 01:18:54.940
That's a nice fucking
example you're setting...

01:18:55.023 --> 01:18:56.149
Language!

01:18:56.233 --> 01:18:57.734
Sorry. Sorry.

01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:05.951
You know, Ted,
when I was a little boy,

01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:10.247
I saw you on television.

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:11.873
And I thought you were
the most amazing,

01:19:11.957 --> 01:19:14.626
most wonderful thing
I'd ever seen. Ever.

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:20.423
And I asked my dad if I could have
a magical little teddy bear, too.

01:19:20.507 --> 01:19:21.925
And he said, "No."

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.511
Can you just email me
the rest of this story?

01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:26.930
And I was so heartbroken.

01:19:27.639 --> 01:19:30.433
And I promised myself that
if I ever had a son,

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.689
I would never,
ever, ever say no to him.

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:39.109
Even

01:19:39.276 --> 01:19:42.279
Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every
once in a while wouldn't hurt.

01:19:42.362 --> 01:19:44.364
Me and Ted are going
to be best friends, Daddy.

01:19:44.906 --> 01:19:47.909
Yes, you are,
my little chipmunk.

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:53.164
Happy playtime.

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:57.210
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:19:57.294 --> 01:19:59.421
I said a bad word
one time.

01:20:00.213 --> 01:20:01.840
Daddy punished me
for it.

01:20:01.923 --> 01:20:04.175
That's a great story.
I felt like I was there.

01:20:04.384 --> 01:20:06.177
Daddy gave me an ouch.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:09.180
Now, I have to
give you an ouch.

01:20:14.227 --> 01:20:16.563
All right, kid, you win.
We'll do it your way.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.231
What do you want to do?
You want to play a game?

01:20:18.315 --> 01:20:19.733
It's playtime, right?
We'll play a game.

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:21.735
Yeah, I want to
play a game.

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:23.862
Good, good. Let's see.
How about we...

01:20:23.945 --> 01:20:25.697
How about we play a little
game of hide and seek?

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:28.283
I love hide and seek.
I'll hide.

01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:30.618
Now, hang on a sec, there.

01:20:30.702 --> 01:20:34.247
Your dad likes you to show good manners.
Right, Tubby McFat-Fuck?

01:20:34.581 --> 01:20:36.458
Okay. You hide first.

01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:37.625
Great. Fantastic.

01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:41.212
Okay, now you count to 100, and
then you try to find me, okay?

01:20:41.296 --> 01:20:42.339
Okay.

01:20:43.882 --> 01:20:46.551
Do I need to wash my hands
before I play this game?

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.555
No. That's a weird fucking question.
No, just start counting.

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.768
One, two,

01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:59.105
three, four, five,

01:20:59.814 --> 01:21:01.900
six, seven...

01:21:02.067 --> 01:21:04.235
No peeking, now,
or you'll get kid cancer.

01:21:04.402 --> 01:21:07.697
...eight, nine, ten,

01:21:08.365 --> 01:21:11.826
eleven, twelve,
thirteen...

01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:04.921
Ah!

01:22:31.156 --> 01:22:32.198
Hey.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:33.992
Hey.

01:22:35.285 --> 01:22:36.578
You walking home
alone, huh?

01:22:37.036 --> 01:22:38.079
Yeah.

01:22:39.414 --> 01:22:40.582
Do you need a lift?

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:42.083
Oh, I'm okay.

01:22:42.167 --> 01:22:44.836
If I get raped, it'll be my
fault for what I'm wearing.

01:22:45.712 --> 01:22:47.922
Listen, John.

01:22:49.174 --> 01:22:51.426
There's something that I
need to say to you, too.

01:23:06.858 --> 01:23:08.568
Hey.
Hey.

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:10.487
John, I hope that...

01:23:11.237 --> 01:23:13.406
Listen, I don't want
you to think that...

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:17.869
Sorry.

01:23:18.369 --> 01:23:21.331
I want us to keep talking
because I think that maybe...

01:23:22.499 --> 01:23:23.541
Go ahead.

01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:25.335
Whoever this is,
it's not a good time.

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:26.878
John, it's me.
Can you hear me?

01:23:27.378 --> 01:23:29.547
Ted? Listen,
I got to call you back.

01:23:29.631 --> 01:23:31.591
No, John, don't hang up!
I'm in trouble.

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:33.259
What do you mean?
What kind of trouble?

01:23:33.426 --> 01:23:35.470
They got me. That freaky
guy from the park,

01:23:35.553 --> 01:23:37.222
and that kid who I
think is his son,

01:23:37.305 --> 01:23:38.681
but may also be his lover,
I don't know.

01:23:38.765 --> 01:23:40.099
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
Where are you?

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:41.434
Uh...

01:23:41.518 --> 01:23:42.894
I'm not sure, it's...

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:46.105
Hello? Hello, John?

01:23:47.482 --> 01:23:48.525
Hello?

01:23:49.359 --> 01:23:51.861
You're not a very
polite guest, are you?

01:23:51.945 --> 01:23:53.029
Shit!

01:23:53.112 --> 01:23:55.323
Ted, hello? Ted?

01:23:55.406 --> 01:23:56.783
What's the matter?
Is he okay?

01:23:57.242 --> 01:23:58.952
I don't know.
Where is he?

01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:00.828
I don't know. He just
said he was in trouble.

01:24:01.663 --> 01:24:03.039
Can you call him back?

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:04.332
No, it's blocked.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.584
Wait a second.

01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:12.590
Go. Take Columbus to Herald
and get on the expressway.

01:24:16.177 --> 01:24:17.804
Hello, 911?

01:24:17.929 --> 01:24:19.222
I need the police
right away.

01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:21.391
This guy took
my teddy bear.

01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:23.226
Hello?

01:24:26.104 --> 01:24:28.273
Let me out of here,
you crazy bastard!

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:31.901
I hear the fat kid running.
I hear the fat kid running.

01:24:31.985 --> 01:24:34.153
I bet it's hilarious.
Let me out of here!

01:24:34.362 --> 01:24:36.239
I am a citizen of
the United States of America

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:37.699
and I have rights!

01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:41.995
Robert, seatbelt.

01:24:42.954 --> 01:24:44.831
It should be
right here, somewhere.

01:24:49.127 --> 01:24:50.169
Johnny!

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:53.256
Whoa, whoa! Stop, stop!
That's them, turn around!

01:24:59.512 --> 01:25:00.555
Stay with them.

01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:09.564
Hang om

01:25:27.582 --> 01:25:28.875
Back off, Susan Boyle!

01:25:34.088 --> 01:25:36.174
Oh, my God! He's going to jump!
Get closer.

01:25:41.137 --> 01:25:42.972
All right, easy.
Come on, Ted.

01:25:46.559 --> 01:25:47.644
Shit!
Yes!

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:50.313
Hey, Johnny!
Total <i> T.J. Hooker</i>, right?

01:25:50.396 --> 01:25:51.648
Yes! Fucking-A right!

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:56.361
Oh, shit!

01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:02.575
Go! Go! Go!

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:16.714
Daddy!

01:26:18.758 --> 01:26:20.635
Let's see how well
you know these streets.

01:26:22.595 --> 01:26:23.638
Where is he?

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:45.576
Jesus!

01:26:58.047 --> 01:26:59.298
There he is.
Pull over.

01:27:32.874 --> 01:27:33.916
Where?

01:27:36.002 --> 01:27:37.211
No!

01:27:37.295 --> 01:27:41.382
You can't have
my teddy bear!

01:27:47.847 --> 01:27:49.348
Holy shit.

01:27:49.432 --> 01:27:50.475
Sorry.

01:27:50.558 --> 01:27:52.518
Somebody had to go Joan
Crawford on that kid.

01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:54.353
Come on.

01:27:59.025 --> 01:28:00.193
Ted?

01:28:06.908 --> 01:28:08.034
Oh, my God!

01:28:11.245 --> 01:28:12.288
Shit!

01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:39.440
Jesus.

01:28:39.732 --> 01:28:41.651
Stay here. Just stay there!
No, John!

01:28:52.954 --> 01:28:54.497
You're mine, Ted!

01:28:54.831 --> 01:28:57.333
Screw you, pal.
I belong to John Bennett.

01:28:57.416 --> 01:29:01.087
But I can give you love,
and rocking horses,

01:29:01.712 --> 01:29:03.256
and dancing.

01:29:03.548 --> 01:29:06.008
I think we're very
far apart on this.

01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:28.072
Ted!

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.121
Oh, my God!

01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:18.456
Ted!

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:21.834
John.

01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:24.337
Lori, get the stuffing.
Get it all.

01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:31.302
Johnny.

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:33.220
You're going to be okay, buddy.
Do you understand?

01:30:33.304 --> 01:30:34.555
You're going to be fine.

01:30:35.389 --> 01:30:38.476
Jesus, I look like
the robot from Aliens.

01:30:38.559 --> 01:30:40.436
No, look at me, buddy.

01:30:40.519 --> 01:30:42.021
I promise,
you're going to be okay.

01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:45.733
I don't think so. I'm...

01:30:47.735 --> 01:30:48.819
I'm in trouble.

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:50.863
I need...

01:30:51.364 --> 01:30:52.865
I need to
tell you something.

01:30:53.366 --> 01:30:54.533
What is it?

01:30:56.786 --> 01:30:59.622
Don't ever lose her again.

01:31:00.373 --> 01:31:02.541
She's the most important...

01:31:05.002 --> 01:31:07.338
...the most important
part of your life.

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.051
Even more than me.

01:31:13.177 --> 01:31:15.721
She's your
thunder buddy now.

01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:18.724
She's...

01:32:01.642 --> 01:32:03.185
I got it.

01:32:18.951 --> 01:32:21.078
Baby, I don't know if
this is going to work.

01:32:21.162 --> 01:32:22.288
Please, just try.

01:32:32.339 --> 01:32:34.008
Come on, buddy.

01:33:20.513 --> 01:33:22.890
I'm so sorry.

01:33:23.349 --> 01:33:26.185
You did everything
you could.

01:33:26.894 --> 01:33:28.896
I'm so sorry.

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:04.260
Ted!

01:36:04.343 --> 01:36:05.427
I'm alive, Johnny!

01:36:05.594 --> 01:36:06.595
Oh, my God!

01:36:06.679 --> 01:36:08.973
I'm alive.
Your magical wish worked!

01:36:09.807 --> 01:36:10.849
You're back!

01:36:11.058 --> 01:36:12.935
Yeah, I mean,
when you sewed me up

01:36:13.018 --> 01:36:14.895
you put some of the stuffing
in the wrong places

01:36:14.979 --> 01:36:16.772
so I'm a little fucked up.

01:36:16.855 --> 01:36:19.692
But will you take care of me
forever and ever?

01:36:21.819 --> 01:36:23.821
I'm just Kidding you.
I thought it would be funny

01:36:23.904 --> 01:36:25.489
if you thought
I was fucking retarded.

01:36:25.864 --> 01:36:27.032
You asshole!

01:36:27.449 --> 01:36:29.368
Come here, you bastard.

01:36:31.203 --> 01:36:32.246
Ah!

01:36:32.538 --> 01:36:33.914
Welcome back, Ted.

01:36:36.625 --> 01:36:37.668
It was you.

01:36:38.919 --> 01:36:39.962
You did it.

01:36:40.421 --> 01:36:41.797
Son of a bitch!

01:36:42.298 --> 01:36:43.966
You wished for
my life back.

01:36:44.216 --> 01:36:46.510
No. No.

01:36:46.719 --> 01:36:48.512
I wished for my life back.

01:37:01.275 --> 01:37:02.318
I love you.

01:37:02.735 --> 01:37:04.445
I love you, too.

01:37:06.447 --> 01:37:09.325
And I want you to know that,
after last night

01:37:09.408 --> 01:37:12.453
I don't ever want to lose anyone
who matters to me ever again.

01:37:12.536 --> 01:37:14.830
I'm not going to wait any
longer for my life to start.

01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:17.291
Lori,

01:37:18.667 --> 01:37:20.169
will you marry me?

01:37:21.837 --> 01:37:24.590
All I ever wanted
was you, John Bennett.

01:37:29.678 --> 01:37:34.475
<i>And so John, Lori and
Ted lived happily ever after.</i>

01:37:34.767 --> 01:37:39.646
<i>Having discovered at last, that all
they really needed was each other.</i>

01:37:41.982 --> 01:37:45.069
<i>John and Lori were
married in Cambridge</i>

01:37:45.152 --> 01:37:48.447
<i>by a very special
Justice of the Peace.</i>

01:37:49.114 --> 01:37:51.867
By the power vested in me

01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:54.953
by the New York Jets

01:37:55.079 --> 01:37:59.083
and by the united peoples
of the planet Mongo,

01:37:59.208 --> 01:38:03.003
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

01:38:03.087 --> 01:38:05.381
You may kiss the bride,
Johnny.

01:38:23.899 --> 01:38:26.902
Hi. Tom Skerritt.

01:38:27.319 --> 01:38:28.821
Tom Skerritt! Wow!

01:38:29.279 --> 01:38:31.532
Thanks so much for coming.

01:38:31.615 --> 01:38:34.827
My daughter better be alive,
you sick son of a bitch.

01:38:35.994 --> 01:38:39.039
I am so fake-happy
for her.

01:39:05.941 --> 01:39:09.278
You know, Sam, there's only
one way to end a perfect day.

01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:10.320
What's that?

01:39:10.404 --> 01:39:11.488
Flash jump.

01:39:11.572 --> 01:39:13.198
Right.

01:39:13.282 --> 01:39:16.285
One, two, three!

01:39:16.452 --> 01:39:18.704
Yeah!

01:39:22.374 --> 01:39:26.128
<i>And that's the story
of how one magical wish</i>

01:39:26.211 --> 01:39:30.632
<i>forever changed the lives
of three very special friends.</i>

01:39:31.049 --> 01:39:35.762
<i>Ted and Tami-Lynn continued their
torrid love affair for quite some time.</i>

01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:39.141
<i>One afternoon, Ted was caught
behind the deli counter</i>

01:39:39.224 --> 01:39:42.686
<i>eating potato salad off of
Tami-Lynn's bare bottom.</i>

01:39:42.769 --> 01:39:46.190
<i>He was instantly
promoted to store manager.</i>

01:39:46.565 --> 01:39:48.859
<i>Sam Jones moved
back to Hollywood</i>

01:39:48.942 --> 01:39:51.528
<i>with the goal of
restarting his film career.</i>

01:39:51.612 --> 01:39:53.530
<i>He currently
resides in Burbank</i>

01:39:53.614 --> 01:39:55.574
<i>where he shares
a studio apartment</i>

01:39:56.408 --> 01:39:57.910
<i>with his roommate,
Brandon Routh.</i>

01:39:57.993 --> 01:40:01.705
<i>Remember Brandon Routh from
that God-awful Superman movie?</i>

01:40:01.788 --> 01:40:03.248
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

01:40:03.332 --> 01:40:07.211
<i>Thanks for getting our hopes up
and taking a giant shit on us.</i>

01:40:07.586 --> 01:40:10.797
<i>Rex was forced to give up
his pursuit of Lori.</i>

01:40:10.881 --> 01:40:13.800
<i>Not long afterward, he fell
into a deep depression</i>

01:40:13.884 --> 01:40:16.220
<i>and died of
Lou Gehrig's disease.</i>

01:40:16.678 --> 01:40:19.181
<i>Donny was arrested
by Boston police</i>

01:40:19.264 --> 01:40:22.017
<i>and charged with
kidnapping a plush toy.</i>

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.645
<i>The charges were dropped
when everyone realized</i>

01:40:24.728 --> 01:40:27.231
<i>how completely stupid
that sounded.</i>

01:40:27.689 --> 01:40:31.109
<i>Robert got a trainer, lost a
substantial amount of weight</i>

01:40:31.193 --> 01:40:32.486
<i>and went on to become</i>

01:40:32.569 --> 01:40:34.613
<i>Taylor Lautner.</i>
