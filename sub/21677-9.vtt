00:12.292 --> 00:12.958
- Previously

00:12.583 --> 00:12.958
on "Below Deck"...

00:14.292 --> 00:15.333
- Happy Valentine's Day.

00:15.333 --> 00:16.375
I don't have a valentine, no.

00:16.375 --> 00:17.958
- We might have to change that.

00:17.958 --> 00:19.458
- I would like
to take you for dinner.

00:19.458 --> 00:21.375
- I would love to.
- Kelley is gonna flip.

00:23.375 --> 00:24.667
- Sierra's looking nice.

00:26.292 --> 00:27.500
- Okay, yeah.
That'd be cool.

00:29.208 --> 00:30.667
- Yeah, there is.

00:32.042 --> 00:33.542
- Are you guys leaving me?

00:33.542 --> 00:35.167
- Come on back in, Kelley.
- Roger that.

00:35.167 --> 00:36.542
- Like, what are you guys doing?

00:36.542 --> 00:38.208
- I've worked on big boats,

00:38.208 --> 00:39.542
and I've never seen
such a sh--show.

00:39.542 --> 00:42.208
- Ben, your lady is waiting.
- What lady?

00:42.208 --> 00:43.667
- Emily.
They're going on a date.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.208
- Oh.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.625
This is like a fly ball
into left field,

00:46.625 --> 00:48.417
and I'm sitting out there
picking daisies.

00:48.417 --> 00:49.500
Cheers.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.417
- To Kelley not being here.

00:51.417 --> 00:52.583
- He's always, like,
making more drama.

00:52.583 --> 00:53.917
Like, this is what he wants.

00:53.917 --> 00:55.417
- Making more drama?
- Kelley.

00:55.417 --> 00:56.542
Forget about him.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.042
"F--- off."

01:01.375 --> 01:03.917
- God damn it.
- What do you have there?

01:03.917 --> 01:06.542
- Someone left the toaster on,
just smoking a bit.

01:06.542 --> 01:08.542
- Are you joking?

01:08.542 --> 01:10.208
- And the hits keep coming.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.292
- Feel like Lauren
owes me an apology,

01:48.292 --> 01:50.625
but I'm not sure remembers
how rude she was.

01:50.625 --> 01:52.292
- I'm gonna eat your pizza,

01:52.292 --> 01:54.125
'cause you ain't
getting that sh--.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.417
- You don't need
to live in filth.

01:55.417 --> 01:57.125
- I don't appreciate it.
- Dave.

01:57.125 --> 01:59.292
- Where have you been?

01:59.292 --> 02:01.750
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Like, legit.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.250
- Excuse me,
you need to realize

02:03.250 --> 02:04.958
that we're talking about
a safety thing--

02:04.958 --> 02:06.625
I'm sorry to interrupt.
- No, no, that's okay.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.417
- Nico?
Who do you think you guys are?

02:09.417 --> 02:12.167
I might not be Lauren
and Nico's boss on deck,

02:12.167 --> 02:13.625
but I certainly am a higher rank

02:13.625 --> 02:15.250
and have more seniority
on this boat,

02:15.250 --> 02:16.667
and they need to respect that.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.583
- Ay-yi-yi.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.000
- Hey, you.
- Hello, how are you?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.250
- How's it going?

02:25.250 --> 02:27.000
Good, how are you?
- Good. Good.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.417
Good night last night.
- Yeah. It was great.

02:31.417 --> 02:32.667
- It was fun.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.417
I thought it was
a fabulous first date.

02:34.417 --> 02:36.750
I laughed a lot,
and we both had a great time.

02:36.750 --> 02:37.792
- All right, love.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.750
- Where'd you live
in London, Lauren?

02:40.750 --> 02:43.458
- Putney, southwest.
- Yeah, I know where Putney is.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.292
- I'm a bit tired.
- Are you?

02:45.292 --> 02:46.292
- Yeah.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.333
- You might as well just take

02:49.333 --> 02:52.000
a mouthful of coffee beans
and just chew 'em.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.542
- Can you do me a favor, Lauren?
- Yeah.

02:53.542 --> 02:56.292
- Let me know
when she comes to London,

02:56.292 --> 02:57.792
so I can f---ing
get out of town.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.708
- Jesus Christ, Kyle.
That's so unnecessary.

03:00.708 --> 03:03.042
- Kyle's broken-hearted.
I understand.

03:03.042 --> 03:04.292
- I thought you guys
were all right.

03:06.208 --> 03:09.042
- At this point, the vibes
on the boat aren't very good.

03:09.042 --> 03:10.500
Kyle's upset.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.042
Kelley's pissed off
for some reason

03:12.042 --> 03:13.500
that's got nothing
to do with him.

03:13.500 --> 03:17.208
It's ridiculous.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.375
- So good. Good conversation.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.125
He was very funny.
It was really nice.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.708
So, what happened
with you last night?

03:31.708 --> 03:34.208
Did you actually go for dinner
with Kyle and them, or not?

03:34.208 --> 03:36.583
- No.
I thought we had a nice time.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.083
I guess he came in
and started, like,

03:38.083 --> 03:40.417
kicking off to Kelley
when he was angry,

03:40.417 --> 03:42.083
and he was like, "This is why
I don't talk to birds."

03:42.083 --> 03:44.250
And apparently that's,
like, an English term.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.250
- Um, yeah.
- Like, what's going on?

03:46.250 --> 03:47.750
What's wrong?
And Kelley just starts,

03:47.750 --> 03:50.250
like, going off on me.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.417
Honestly, I think
he was so jealous

03:52.417 --> 03:55.500
that you were out with Ben,
and he took it out on me.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.417
I feel like Kyle
expected too much.

03:58.417 --> 03:59.583
- He was trying to woo you.

03:59.583 --> 04:00.875
- But that's not my fault

04:00.875 --> 04:02.750
that I don't feel the same.

04:02.750 --> 04:06.208
I've made it so clear to Kyle
that I was not interested.

04:06.208 --> 04:08.833
- You do realize
that I find you very attractive.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.500
You're stunning.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.417
- You think I'm cool?
- We'll go dutch.

04:12.417 --> 04:13.708
- No.

04:13.708 --> 04:14.750
- No, no, no.
- I just think, like,

04:14.750 --> 04:15.750
the more, the merrier.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.583
So why he chose to, like,

04:17.583 --> 04:19.375
make me out to be a liar,

04:19.375 --> 04:22.750
or like I was, like,
hurting his feelings, like,

04:22.750 --> 04:23.750
it's bullsh--.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.125
- Kelley, Kelley, Lee.

04:27.125 --> 04:28.417
Can I see you in the bridge
for a second?

04:28.417 --> 04:30.125
- Coming up now.

04:31.458 --> 04:32.875
Morning, Captain.

04:32.875 --> 04:35.625
- I am not happy
with what happened last night.

04:35.625 --> 04:38.625
We had a discussion
about the way the boat was left,

04:38.625 --> 04:40.125
with the sushi hanging out.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.125
- Yeah.
- Sure enough,

04:42.125 --> 04:43.708
I stumble
over a piece of pizza

04:43.708 --> 04:46.292
that's got a bite missing
and a trail of pepperoni.

04:46.292 --> 04:49.625
That's twice that we've had
to address this issue.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.125
If I have to address it
one more time,

04:52.125 --> 04:55.292
everybody's gonna be
confined down there.

04:55.292 --> 04:57.708
That's where they will eat,
sleep, shower, clean up,

04:57.708 --> 05:00.667
and only come up here
to get off the boat and to work.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.917
Respect the boat.
That's one of the rules.

05:02.917 --> 05:05.250
- I will handle this
and do the best I can

05:05.250 --> 05:07.292
not to let it happen
for a third time.

05:07.292 --> 05:08.625
- I trust that you will.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.625
- I definitely will.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.125
- So, last night...

05:18.500 --> 05:23.167
They're not gone 60 seconds
before Sierra storms in,

05:23.167 --> 05:26.167
so upset because Kelley
yelled at her.

05:26.167 --> 05:27.667
Kelley should not
have yelled at Sierra.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.167
It's none of his business.

05:29.167 --> 05:30.667
- Kelley's being
a little off with me.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.750
He's being nice to Emily,

05:32.750 --> 05:34.667
but if I were Kelley,
I'd feel like a bit of a jerk,

05:34.667 --> 05:36.417
to be honest,
asking her out on dates.

05:36.417 --> 05:38.167
- He's being a jerk to everyone.
When did he ask her?

05:38.167 --> 05:39.500
- You know,
he tried to push, like,

05:39.500 --> 05:41.875
a double date
with Kyle and Sierra.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.958
- So that's probably why
he was so mad at Sierra

05:43.958 --> 05:45.875
for messing things up with Kyle,

05:45.875 --> 05:48.458
'cause it messed up his plan.
It's all about Kelley.

05:48.458 --> 05:52.208
Kelley is a very fragile
little piece of porcelain.

05:52.208 --> 05:55.542
He's used to being the guy
all the girls want.

05:55.542 --> 05:58.500
He's used to being, like,
the best deckhand.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.542
And lately,
he's not getting the girls,

06:00.542 --> 06:02.208
and the captain's
calling him out,

06:02.208 --> 06:04.542
and he's going
kind of on a spiral of anger.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.458
How was your date,
by the way?

06:06.458 --> 06:09.667
- She's an interesting girl.
She's super smart.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.292
- Mm-hmm.

06:11.292 --> 06:12.708
How's it going?

06:12.708 --> 06:15.708
- Good.
Do you want to talk?

06:15.708 --> 06:17.792
- About what?
- Last night.

06:17.792 --> 06:21.375
- The captain should never
find slices of half-eaten pizza

06:21.375 --> 06:23.417
on the way to his room.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.417
- F---, I don't know what's up
with Kate coming at me.

06:25.417 --> 06:27.708
- She's trying to yell
at you and she's talking

06:27.708 --> 06:29.333
and just like--

06:29.333 --> 06:30.750
- And you walk away,

06:30.750 --> 06:33.917
and she's like,
"Who do you think you are?"

06:33.917 --> 06:36.000
- Too many things happened
in a short amount of time

06:36.000 --> 06:37.833
that were disrespectful
and dangerous.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.583
- Yeah.

06:39.583 --> 06:41.250
- When there's a safety issue,
Lauren and Nico--

06:41.250 --> 06:42.750
- At the same time,
though, Nico handled it.

06:45.417 --> 06:46.583
- I just want to apologize.

06:46.583 --> 06:47.750
I got defensive of them

06:47.750 --> 06:49.333
when I should've listened
to you.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.875
You're pretty much
a voice of reason.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.667
Kate is an enemy
you do not want to have,

06:53.667 --> 06:58.917
and I will kiss Kate's ass
till the day we leave this boat.

06:58.917 --> 07:01.333
- Hey, Kelley.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.958
Did you know
that I gave her flowers?

07:03.958 --> 07:04.958
- Who?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.625
- Emily.
- No.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.292
- Okay. Okay.
- If I would've known that,

07:08.292 --> 07:09.625
I wouldn't have gotten
involved.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.792
I wouldn't have even said
anything to her.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.625
- Okay, good.

07:12.625 --> 07:13.625
- I'm a little frustrated
over the Ben and Emily thing,

07:13.625 --> 07:15.417
but I am here to do my job.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.292
I'm not here to chase women.

07:17.292 --> 07:19.583
And maybe Emily was
just testing the waters.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.250
Who knows?
Maybe she wanted to talk to me,

07:21.250 --> 07:22.583
talk to Ben, talk to Nico,

07:22.583 --> 07:24.625
and then pick
whichever one she wanted.

07:24.625 --> 07:27.292
- I just figured that you knew
that I gave her flowers,

07:27.292 --> 07:28.875
and you were still pushing her
for a date, and--

07:28.875 --> 07:30.625
- No, I wouldn't push her
for a date

07:30.625 --> 07:32.292
if you'd given her flowers
and you were interested.

07:32.292 --> 07:34.792
- Okay. Okay.
Well, then...

07:34.792 --> 07:36.292
Hey, Kelley, I'm sorry.

07:36.292 --> 07:37.458
- It's all right, bud.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.083
- Daddy.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.667
Hello, Maxy.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.083
Is Daddy there?

07:55.083 --> 07:57.000
- He's right here.
- Are you okay?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.417
- I'm fine.
How are you?

07:58.417 --> 07:59.917
I heard you were
a little bit ill.

07:59.917 --> 08:02.333
- No, I'm whacked.
I'm whacked.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.333
So, what'd you do?
Tell me about you, my princess.

08:04.333 --> 08:09.333
- Daddy, last night I went for
a date with the chef on board.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.792
- You went with the chef,
and you went out on a date?

08:11.792 --> 08:14.000
- Mm.
- Rabbit!

08:14.000 --> 08:15.833
Oh, naughty girl.
What a naughty girl.

08:15.833 --> 08:18.500
- I'm not a naughty girl.
What are you talking about?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.583
- Oh, no, you're not.
I'm just winding you.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.958
- I know.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.583
I'm very close
to both my parents.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.833
They really try
and stay out of telling me

08:25.833 --> 08:27.542
what to do
with my relationships

08:27.542 --> 08:29.375
and who I should
and shouldn't date,

08:29.375 --> 08:30.875
because I'm quite mature
for my age.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.833
I'm very open with them.

08:34.542 --> 08:35.958
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you, Rabbit.

08:35.958 --> 08:36.958
Bye-bye.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.875
- Kate, Ben, and Kelley--

08:38.875 --> 08:41.667
I need you
in the crew mess ASAP.

08:41.667 --> 08:42.750
- Copy.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.708
- Hi, Lee.

08:46.708 --> 08:48.458
- Hello.
- Thank you.

08:48.458 --> 08:50.458
Ooh, this is exciting.

08:50.458 --> 08:54.375
- Rebecca Fearing,
well-known psychic medium

08:54.375 --> 08:59.792
who communicates
with spirits who have passed.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.042
- I totally believe
in the supernatural.

09:05.042 --> 09:08.000
I think anybody
that is closed-minded about it

09:08.000 --> 09:10.750
is not that intelligent.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.750
- We have Jennifer Shaffer,
Susan Pinsky,

09:13.750 --> 09:16.750
and Cindy Kaza, psychic as well.

09:18.083 --> 09:20.500
- And they're bringing
their friends, Scott,

09:20.500 --> 09:21.667
Blake, and Emerson.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.083
And we're gonna spread
some ashes

09:23.083 --> 09:25.875
from Scott's
great-aunt off the yacht.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.917
- Definitely a first.
- This is a very...

09:28.917 --> 09:31.000
- Weird.
- Heavy-energy...

09:31.000 --> 09:32.917
- Morose.
- Charter.

09:32.917 --> 09:36.750
- A spiritual yoga session
on the yacht.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.750
They need a psychic-themed
dinner party,

09:39.750 --> 09:41.917
and they want me to be there.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.917
- I'm getting a feeling. Shh.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.083
I'm getting a sense
Ben is going to get frustrated

09:47.083 --> 09:48.875
with guests' food requests.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.750
It's just a feeling I'm getting.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.917
- Well, I mean--
- Let me see your hand.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.458
You see what this line is?

09:53.458 --> 09:56.625
It's very short.
That's your temper.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.625
And this line here--
that's gluten, there.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.958
There's gonna be
a gluten issue.

10:01.958 --> 10:03.625
- That's pretty good, Kate.
- I know.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.208
- I think she's
a pretty good palm reader.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.750
- That's pretty good.
- We're done here.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.125
- Coming up...

10:10.125 --> 10:11.792
- The pool is floating away.

10:11.792 --> 10:13.792
- Oh, my God.

10:13.792 --> 10:15.625
- That's a very expensive piece
of equipment

10:15.625 --> 10:16.958
just floating off
into the sunset.

10:16.958 --> 10:18.458
It's a train wreck.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.208
- I'm excited to meet her.
- Yeah.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.208
- They're psychic,
so everything.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.292
- We're gonna just uncover this.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.167
All right.
Hop up here.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.667
We're gonna have
a little powwow up here.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.833
All right, what you do
on deck is amazing.

10:50.833 --> 10:53.625
Y'all are like
the tripod that I stand upon.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.125
Y'all are amazing workers.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.167
We just need to respect
the boat.

10:59.167 --> 11:01.167
About the whole pizza thing.

11:01.167 --> 11:03.750
I know it's our night off,
but Kate's got the experience.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.000
Sometimes, we just got
to shut up and listen to her.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
- I don't remember
dropping the pizza at all,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.333
and somehow it's become
this big deal

11:10.333 --> 11:12.667
where Kelley has to call
a meeting for it.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.208
Like, really?

11:14.208 --> 11:16.208
I mean, our deck crew
gets constantly nitpicked,

11:16.208 --> 11:17.292
and I'm sick of it.

11:17.292 --> 11:19.042
- I had the talk with Captain

11:19.042 --> 11:21.167
regarding disrespect
of the boat.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.042
He's like an eagle watching
a mouse run across the field.

11:23.042 --> 11:24.667
He's waiting to snatch us up.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.625
Basically,
we're on our second strike.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.708
Third strike--
we're confined to crew quarters.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.208
Let's just try to be
a little more mindful.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.875
And I'm gonna step
my game up too, as well.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.708
- Yeah.
- Our next charter guest

11:34.708 --> 11:36.167
is a psychic.
- Sweet.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.000
- So while we're on
this charter,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.708
we are gonna
be psychic ourselves

11:39.708 --> 11:41.875
and know what the f---
these guests want at all times.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.042
- I'm feeling super salty
towards Kelley.

11:44.042 --> 11:45.958
You know, he's very emotional,

11:45.958 --> 11:48.042
loves his emotions,
and whatever,

11:48.042 --> 11:51.208
but there's some things
that he can work on to improve.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.958
- On our nights off, let's be
extra careful, all right?

11:58.083 --> 11:59.583
- I think Kelley got
in trouble for,

11:59.583 --> 12:01.333
like, not being strict with us.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.167
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:03.167 --> 12:04.917
- He's just, "Aw, you know,
Captain's coming down on me."

12:04.917 --> 12:07.167
It's like, yeah, well,
that's your f---ing job, man.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.583
You don't want it?
I'll take it.

12:09.583 --> 12:10.667
You know?
Move out the way.

12:17.917 --> 12:21.583
- Attention, all crew--
we have guests arriving in 15.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.000
Put on our happy faces.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.750
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.583
- I've never been here before,

12:34.583 --> 12:37.208
but it still has a feeling
of being familiar to me.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.792
- Here we go.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.792
- I'm glad I didn't wear
my Louboutins.

12:40.792 --> 12:41.958
- Hello.
- Captain Lee.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.125
- Lovely to meet you.

12:43.125 --> 12:44.125
- Hello, welcome.
- Jennifer.

12:44.125 --> 12:45.917
- Hi, Rebecca.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.750
- I was expecting,
from the primary,

12:47.750 --> 12:50.125
something
a little bit more mystical.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.792
- Hi, nice to meet you.

12:51.792 --> 12:52.958
- She's
a world-renowned psychic,

12:52.958 --> 12:54.292
but she's not wearing,

12:54.292 --> 12:56.792
like, a bunch of crystals
and tie-dye,

12:56.792 --> 12:59.625
and she just looks like
a normal paranormal.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.292
- Just handsome men,
the whole line of them.

13:01.292 --> 13:03.125
I'm happy.

13:03.125 --> 13:06.083
- Welcome aboard
motor yacht "Valor."

13:06.083 --> 13:08.083
Kate will show you around
the boat, give you a tour,

13:08.083 --> 13:09.417
and we'll get off the dock

13:09.417 --> 13:11.125
and enjoy some of this
beautiful weather.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.917
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.958
- Okay, to the crew.
- Right this way.

13:14.958 --> 13:17.292
- Deck, let's go get bags.
- Whoo.

13:17.292 --> 13:19.333
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.417
- This is our main salon.
It's all brand-new.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.667
- This is gorgeous.
Look at the wine.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.000
- Oh, good.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.792
- Everyone, we're gonna
continue down the hall.

13:26.792 --> 13:29.000
This is the master suite.
- Oh, this is pretty.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I never sleep much,
being a psychic.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.417
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

13:32.417 --> 13:34.333
- And then the bathroom's
quite grand.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.833
- I feel comfortable here.

13:35.833 --> 13:38.417
It sort of resonates
really strong.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.917
- Whenever you're ready,
we can go bow to stern.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.833
- Let's go. Dude, bring it up.
Bring it up.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.667
Bring it up. Bring it up.
It's taking too long.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.000
- You're all clear on your
stern, Cap, for traffic.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.333
- Okay, Cap.
All lines are clear.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.833
All lines are clear.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.917
- Roger that.
We're out of here.

13:51.917 --> 13:54.167
- This is insane.
- This is so great.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.292
- I wanted to treat you all,
since you're all my BFFs.

13:57.292 --> 14:02.208
- We are so grateful.
- Okay, so now we'll go outside.

14:06.042 --> 14:09.000
- I want to come lay out here
and sun tan all day.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.667
- How are y'all
enjoying it so far?

14:17.667 --> 14:18.667
- Awesome.
- It's so good.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.042
- Much better now. Hi.

14:20.042 --> 14:21.417
- Hi.
- Uh-oh.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.833
- Oh, I made him blush,
I like it.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.375
- All right.
Well, I run the deck department.

14:27.375 --> 14:31.042
I'm the boatswain on board,
and we have a bunch of toys.

14:31.042 --> 14:33.167
Captain Lee wants me to be
more proactive with things,

14:33.167 --> 14:35.375
so I'm gonna apply it
to everything.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.375
What would be your number-one
priority to get out?

14:37.375 --> 14:39.042
- The slide.
- The slide first?

14:39.042 --> 14:41.042
- That's really important
to me personally.

14:41.042 --> 14:42.917
- So we'll do the slide first.
- And what's your name again?

14:42.917 --> 14:44.083
- Kelley.
- Kelley, thank you.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.500
- I will remember that.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.167
And at some point,
they'll have to say,

14:47.167 --> 14:48.750
"Stop sexually harassing
Kelley."

14:48.750 --> 14:50.042
- I know!

14:57.042 --> 14:59.167
- I just made 75 grand
for charity.

14:59.167 --> 15:00.750
- Yay.
- Wow.

15:00.750 --> 15:01.917
- I'm a charity.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.250
- Yeah, can you make
75 grand for me?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.042
- My name's Charity.
- This is Charity.

15:05.042 --> 15:06.417
I'm Hope.
Can you help us?

15:06.417 --> 15:08.250
- On my mark, I want two shots.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.750
Two shots.
- Roger, two shots.

15:10.750 --> 15:13.042
- And drop.
- Drop.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.875
Faster. Faster.
Let it go.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.417
Stop it.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.250
- Pretty sweet here, huh, boys?

15:19.250 --> 15:20.750
- It's amazing.
This is a great anchorage.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.375
- How would you like me
to describe the salad?

15:24.375 --> 15:25.875
It's lobster curry?

15:25.875 --> 15:28.458
- Turmeric lobster salad.
- Okay.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.750
- I'm gonna wear this
as an accessory.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.542
- It's like a bracelet.
- Oh, it is like a bracelet.

15:32.542 --> 15:34.125
- No, it's too small.
- It's a cock ring.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.875
- Cock ring.
- Yes. I'm glad you said it.

15:35.875 --> 15:39.250
- We are on a classy yacht.
Will you stop?

15:39.250 --> 15:40.958
- Would you like
some lobster turmeric salad?

15:40.958 --> 15:42.125
- Yes, that looks delicious.
Thank you.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.542
- Three. Two. One.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.292
- Keep a watch out.

15:49.292 --> 15:50.958
Since there's not a lot of wind
and we're not swinging,

15:50.958 --> 15:52.792
you two can handle this.

15:52.792 --> 15:55.292
- Yeah. Sounds good, man.
- I'm gonna go change over.

15:55.292 --> 15:57.250
- Okay.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.292
- To our dear Rebecca--
hostess.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.458
- Yes.
- Thanks, Rebecca.

16:00.458 --> 16:01.458
- Thank you so much.
- Cheers.

16:01.458 --> 16:02.792
- Thank you.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.125
- Okay, everyone,

16:04.125 --> 16:06.458
the slide is all ready to go
for the guests.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.458
And then from there,
we'll just start inflating

16:08.458 --> 16:10.167
the little buoys,
putting them out.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.125
- Okay, are we happy?
- Yeah, they're very happy.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.417
Everybody had lobster,
and they all love the salad.

16:14.417 --> 16:18.167
- Well, they are...
sort of quasi-human.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.000
- Jump on.
- Okay.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.333
- Please don't kill us, okay?

16:28.333 --> 16:29.500
- We're going 60 miles an hour.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.167
- 60? That's like the highway!

16:31.167 --> 16:32.958
- Oh!

16:34.083 --> 16:36.875
- One. Two. Three.
- Whoo!

16:46.167 --> 16:47.958
- Oh! They're gone.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.042
- The pool is floating away.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.458
- Hey, Kyle?

16:53.458 --> 16:55.167
You're gonna have to grab
that black line

16:55.167 --> 16:57.042
and pull it back in,
because nothing's tied down

16:57.042 --> 16:58.333
to the pool right now.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.208
This is completely
embarrassing.

17:04.208 --> 17:06.917
Why can't we just be
a functional deck crew?

17:15.292 --> 17:17.042
- That's a very expensive
piece of equipment

17:17.042 --> 17:19.000
just floating off
into the sunset.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.833
And it's right
in front of the guests.

17:21.833 --> 17:22.833
It's a train wreck.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.583
- There's obviously
a lot of tension

17:33.583 --> 17:35.083
coming off Kyle towards me,

17:35.083 --> 17:36.333
and I feel badly about that.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.167
But at the same time, like,

17:38.167 --> 17:41.208
I haven't done anything to
warrant this reaction from him.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.250
- Rebecca predicted--
'cause I was heavier,

17:49.250 --> 17:50.917
and she predicted--
she's like, you'll lose,

17:50.917 --> 17:52.250
like, 23 pounds.
- Yeah.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.583
- And literally,
within three years,

17:53.583 --> 17:55.417
I lost 23--
like, on the dot.

17:55.417 --> 17:56.917
- Yeah.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.917
- Do you want them
on the table as well?

18:03.917 --> 18:04.917
- Let's just hang
as much as we can.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.875
- Okay, yeah.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.417
- How are we? Are we all right?
- Brilliant.

18:08.417 --> 18:09.542
- Awesome.
- Please join.

18:14.292 --> 18:16.083
- Oh, that's a good one.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.292
- The north of England
is very, very chilled out.

18:18.292 --> 18:19.958
No one really cares.
- Yeah.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.458
- And because it's just
a smaller country as well,

18:22.458 --> 18:24.292
people are just getting
on with things.

18:24.292 --> 18:26.417
These blokes remind me
of my friends back home.

18:26.417 --> 18:28.458
I need to come out
to West Hollywood with you two.

18:28.458 --> 18:29.542
- Yeah, come visit us.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.083
- All my friends
are drag queens

18:31.083 --> 18:32.292
and all that kind of stuff.
I need to come out.

18:32.292 --> 18:33.917
- Yeah, we will solve that
quickly.

18:33.917 --> 18:35.375
Like, coming from Texas,
it was this horrifying,

18:35.375 --> 18:37.083
religious,
traumatic experience.

18:38.125 --> 18:40.250
- Hi.
- Look at the captain.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.958
- If you guys want
to move to the table,

18:41.958 --> 18:44.125
and we'll get dinner started.
- Wow, look at this.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.458
- Table looks so lovely
this evening.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.417
- Where shall we be?
- This is beautiful.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.125
- I mean...
- We all have a crystal ball.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.542
- Stop that!
- Ha ha ha.

18:51.542 --> 18:54.000
- Kate, I'm obsessed
with my crystal ball.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.500
- Thanks, they were so fun.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.000
- I'm gonna put it right here,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.167
and I'm gonna read
all your fortunes.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.000
- The guests are at the table.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.333
- All right.
We got the first course here.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.167
Please, in your own time.

19:03.167 --> 19:04.667
Carpaccio conch.

19:04.667 --> 19:05.958
- You guys
have to have readings.

19:05.958 --> 19:07.000
- Absolutely.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
- I'm sure Captain Lee--

19:08.000 --> 19:09.458
- You have a very purple aura,

19:09.458 --> 19:11.042
and that's why
you're a good captain.

19:15.292 --> 19:18.000
- This one's good to go, please.
Thanks, you're welcome.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
- I said to the girls,
we're here for a reason.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.958
This isn't what it seems to be.
This is not just to have fun.

19:22.958 --> 19:26.667
- So, here I have some lamb
over butternut squash

19:26.667 --> 19:29.292
with roasted leeks
and roasted tomatoes.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.000
She just read my mind.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.375
- A lot of this is an illusion.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.167
Now, I know that might sound
strange to you,

19:38.167 --> 19:39.542
but if you look
on the other side,

19:39.542 --> 19:42.167
they gather together,
and then they help us.

19:42.167 --> 19:43.667
Now, Captain Lee,
your mother's here,

19:43.667 --> 19:45.667
'cause your mother's passed now,
is that correct?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.500
- No.
- Oh, she's alive?

19:47.500 --> 19:49.625
See, she's alive.
Okay.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.625
Well, I feel like she's in--

19:51.625 --> 19:55.208
okay, no, because, no.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.208
See if I can get it.

19:57.208 --> 20:00.500
I told them that you were
gonna be hard to read, remember?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.542
- Coming up...

20:01.542 --> 20:03.208
- I got 30 f---ing knots
of wind.

20:03.208 --> 20:04.375
It's gonna be
just a little lumpy,

20:04.375 --> 20:06.208
so let's hang on.

20:06.208 --> 20:08.042
- Oh, God.
She's vomiting everywhere.

20:13.375 --> 20:14.125
- Now, Captain Lee,

20:13.750 --> 20:14.125
your mother's here,

20:16.250 --> 20:17.417
'cause your mother's passed now,
is that correct?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.083
- No.
- Oh, she's alive.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.167
She's alive. Okay.

20:21.167 --> 20:24.417
Well, I feel like she's in--
okay, no.

20:24.417 --> 20:26.500
Because--
no.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.042
- Did you receive a letter
about your mom?

20:28.042 --> 20:31.333
Any, like, documentation
with your mom?

20:31.333 --> 20:33.500
- None.
- None.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.417
- I think it would be
sufficient to say

20:35.417 --> 20:37.750
that I might be
a bit skeptical.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.250
I think it's a crock.

20:40.250 --> 20:43.583
- You've always been in love
with the sea.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.833
- I'd never seen it
till I was 35.

20:45.833 --> 20:47.417
- Really? Wow.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.583
- You have
some very interesting ancestors,

20:49.583 --> 20:51.417
and you're not the only seaman
in your family.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.083
- Did you say semen?

20:53.083 --> 20:55.583
- Yeah, you're not
the only man that...seaman.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.333
No, seaman.
- You've been hanging out

20:57.333 --> 20:58.917
with Emerson too long.
- I hate you, and I love you,

20:58.917 --> 21:00.792
and you stole my joke.

21:01.958 --> 21:02.958
We've got jokes!

21:05.250 --> 21:07.750
- Yeah, we need to be
a little more less seen.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.458
Been around the guests a lot.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.458
- Who said that?
- Just me.

21:11.458 --> 21:12.792
I know how Captain is.

21:12.792 --> 21:15.125
- They wanted to hang out.
- They did.

21:15.125 --> 21:18.250
But we've been...
been there enough.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.625
- I'm being too nice
to the guests?

21:19.625 --> 21:21.250
He won't mind
if I'm being too nice

21:21.250 --> 21:23.542
when he's got a $2,500 tip
in his pocket.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.250
- All right.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.625
Captain Lee, if I can
break ranks here a little bit,

21:28.625 --> 21:30.458
I want to give my seat to Kate

21:30.458 --> 21:32.250
so she can get a reading
from Rebecca.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.625
Is that okay?
- Absolutely.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.250
- Enjoy your dessert.
- No, no.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.750
I always enjoy dessert.
Sit down, young lady.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.250
You've been working
hard enough for us.

21:38.250 --> 21:39.667
This is your chance
to make this happen.

21:39.667 --> 21:42.625
- I've never done this ever.
- Yay!

21:43.833 --> 21:45.625
- I love it.
- Yeah.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.333
- The first thing I pick up
around you is animals.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.792
When you become
a little bit more grounded,

21:49.792 --> 21:52.000
you'll have your little dog
or a pet.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.833
- Okay.
- Kate's having her reading.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.500
- Are they gonna tell her
she's the Devil?

21:57.500 --> 22:00.750
- I really want to listen.
- Oh, I have to too.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.667
- You have a particular man
around you

22:03.667 --> 22:05.792
that you're, like,
kind of waiting for.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.667
So you have an array of men
that like you.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.250
That's not a problem.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.333
It's that one
that just captures your heart

22:11.333 --> 22:15.000
in a way where you're like,
"Wow. This is the person."

22:15.000 --> 22:16.750
And that person
is very close to you now.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.417
- Um...hmm.

22:18.417 --> 22:20.625
I guess.

22:20.625 --> 22:22.458
- He's charming.

22:22.458 --> 22:24.625
He's funny--
tall, dark, handsome guy.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.542
- Yeah!

22:34.542 --> 22:36.625
- No. You said
a lot of good things.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.875
- And this guy
likes pecans and nuts.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.708
- My special person
likes nuts?

22:47.708 --> 22:49.542
- Yeah, he likes--
- I'm not sure that's true.

22:49.542 --> 22:52.333
- Maybe you're getting
the message that he is nuts.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.000
- No, no, no.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.333
- No. I am dating someone
tall and funny with dark hair,

23:00.333 --> 23:02.875
but we're lesbians.

23:02.875 --> 23:06.375
- You have somebody now that
loves you dearly. I know it.

23:10.417 --> 23:13.583
I've always been quite skeptical
of psychics.

23:13.583 --> 23:19.583
Your everyday street-peddling
medium is considered,

23:19.583 --> 23:24.333
at least by me,
as a walking con artist.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.750
- Thank you so much.
That was so fun.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.583
- ♪ What a day this has been ♪

23:28.583 --> 23:30.917
- Good night. Sleep pretty.
- Always.

23:30.917 --> 23:32.417
- Sleep fast.
- With your pretty face.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.708
- This is very weird juju.

23:41.708 --> 23:43.917
- I've had, like,
a sh--load of coffee.

23:43.917 --> 23:47.375
- Yeah. All right.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.708
I don't actually believe
in psychics,

23:49.708 --> 23:52.792
but Emily seems to be
a believer in that sh--.

23:52.792 --> 23:54.458
- Where's my coffee?
- Tea.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.458
- It's tea.
- Oh.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.292
- I just want her to be
on the same page as me

23:58.292 --> 24:00.542
and realize there's
absolutely nothing going on

24:00.542 --> 24:02.625
between me and Kate.

24:02.625 --> 24:04.042
You've got to be English
to drink this.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.625
- I'm 1/4.
- Eh. It's not enough.

24:11.125 --> 24:13.417
- Wind is humpin'.

24:14.792 --> 24:16.292
We're gonna get out of here.

24:16.292 --> 24:18.458
Kelley, Kelley, Lee.
- Go for Kelley.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.958
- Let's pick up the anchor
and get out of here.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.042
- Roger that.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.750
- The conditions on the water

24:22.750 --> 24:24.958
this morning
are less than pleasant.

24:24.958 --> 24:26.417
- This wasn't in the forecast.

24:26.417 --> 24:28.833
- F---ing wind
is blowing, man.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.458
- So I'm gonna pull the hook,

24:30.458 --> 24:31.958
and we'll move on
to a little more calm.

24:33.917 --> 24:36.667
- Quickly.
- Anchor's secure, Cap.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.958
- Captain Lee said we were
gonna have perfect weather.

24:45.958 --> 24:47.750
- We were supposed to have,
like, 10 knots.

24:47.750 --> 24:51.500
- That weather, it's so tricky
the way it changes.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.500
- I got 30 f---ing knots
of wind.

24:55.125 --> 24:57.792
Be just a little lumpy,
so let's hang on

24:57.792 --> 24:59.625
and secure some items, please.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.458
- This is not pleasant,
is it?

25:01.458 --> 25:03.500
- Where we're going,
it's not a question of,

25:03.500 --> 25:05.583
"Are you gonna experience
rough weather?"

25:05.583 --> 25:08.167
It's, "How long are you
gonna experience it for?"

25:08.167 --> 25:09.875
- Oh!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.542
- Hang on, girls.

25:11.542 --> 25:13.042
- We'll get through it,
and when we get through it,

25:13.042 --> 25:14.667
everybody'll have
a good laugh about it.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.125
When they get done puking.

25:16.125 --> 25:17.667
- Oh, if you're gonna vomit,

25:17.667 --> 25:19.042
you have to go
over there in the corner.

25:19.042 --> 25:20.750
- Good morning.
How are you?

25:22.375 --> 25:23.792
- You're gonna be okay.

25:23.792 --> 25:26.375
- The charter guests
are not feeling well.

25:26.375 --> 25:27.792
You want some Dramamine
or ginger ale?

25:27.792 --> 25:29.792
- Okay.

25:29.792 --> 25:31.375
I think they're
a little bit scared,

25:31.375 --> 25:33.042
a little bit puke-y,
a little bit nauseous.

25:33.042 --> 25:36.000
Can I get anybody
anything else?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.542
Okay.

25:37.542 --> 25:39.875
But at least
they're not asking for coffees.

25:39.875 --> 25:42.500
- Look at the horizon.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.708
Telling you,

25:43.708 --> 25:46.000
I have experience
throwing up on boats.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.708
- Ah!

25:48.708 --> 25:50.917
- We've just had
something break.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.000
- Where did something break?
- Sky lounge.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Can you send a stew
to clean up this mess?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.875
- F---. Will you go
help Lauren clean up?

25:57.875 --> 25:59.542
I'm a little annoyed
that the deckhands

25:59.542 --> 26:02.042
can't just get a chamois mop
and fix this.

26:02.042 --> 26:03.583
- Watch your knee, hey?

26:03.583 --> 26:04.917
There's, like, glass shards
right here.

26:04.917 --> 26:06.708
- And frankly,

26:06.708 --> 26:09.042
I don't trust Sierra
around that much broken glass.

26:11.917 --> 26:13.917
- Rebecca? Are you okay?

26:13.917 --> 26:15.250
I want to give you
some Dramamine

26:15.250 --> 26:16.167
so you don't throw up.

26:17.583 --> 26:18.750
Too late.

26:19.917 --> 26:22.042
- Wow. It's pretty aggressive.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.167
F---ing ----!

26:27.167 --> 26:29.000
- We had a bad one there.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.708
- How long is it gonna be
like this for?

26:30.708 --> 26:32.750
- I'm gonna go check.
It's pretty crazy.

26:32.750 --> 26:36.625
- Does he not look
or tell us anything or...

26:36.625 --> 26:38.875
I mean, he just,
what, starts the engines

26:38.875 --> 26:43.875
and f---s off into a 12-foot
swell first, and that's cool?

26:43.875 --> 26:46.542
- She won't open the door.
She's vomiting everywhere.

26:46.542 --> 26:47.917
- Yeah. She's a goner.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.792
- Where are we going,
and how long is the journey?

26:51.792 --> 26:53.208
- We're going around
the corner here

26:53.208 --> 26:54.792
to see if our anchorage
that I had picked out

26:54.792 --> 26:56.750
is gonna be good for us.
- Okay.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.583
I will get us out of this
just as soon as I possibly can.

27:09.083 --> 27:10.208
We're here.

27:10.208 --> 27:11.542
- Roger that.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.833
- It'll be nice here. Whoo.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.083
That was a tense
hour-and-a-half.

27:16.083 --> 27:17.917
Give me three shots.

27:22.167 --> 27:23.792
Lock it in.

27:23.792 --> 27:25.292
- Yeah, she locked in good, Cap.

27:26.792 --> 27:27.917
- Good morning, sunshine.
- How are we?

27:27.917 --> 27:29.625
- Better now.
My shower was...

27:29.625 --> 27:31.083
a rodeo of entertainment.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.000
- This is the best anchorage

27:33.000 --> 27:35.250
that we're gonna find
in this weather.

27:35.250 --> 27:37.750
I can't put the toys out.
We got too much wind.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.958
- Okay. What do you recommend
for the guests today?

27:39.958 --> 27:42.500
- We're going to pick up
the yoga instructor.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.833
- All right, Cap.

27:43.833 --> 27:45.125
I'm gonna take off
and go pick her up right now.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.625
- Yeah.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.250
- See you in a few, Cap.

27:49.792 --> 27:50.792
- So what are they doing?

27:50.792 --> 27:52.958
- The rough seas really,
like...

27:52.958 --> 27:54.833
- Took it out of everybody.

27:54.833 --> 27:56.542
- Of course it did.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.042
Are they hungry at least?

27:58.042 --> 28:00.042
- They're all, like,
scattered and napping

28:00.042 --> 28:01.792
and hiding
on different areas of the boat.

28:01.792 --> 28:03.542
- Okay, so they're
all kind of still seasick.

28:03.542 --> 28:07.125
It takes a few hours
for it to subside, usually.

28:08.542 --> 28:10.667
- Care to do some yoga today?
- Yes.

28:11.792 --> 28:14.333
Morning.
- Good morning.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.000
- Would anybody like grapefruit
or orange?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.708
- Orange, please.

28:22.708 --> 28:24.875
- Was that sort of extreme,
or does that happen a lot?

28:24.875 --> 28:27.000
We try to avoid...that.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.875
- All right.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.875
- Starting child pose.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.167
You can walk your hand back.

28:32.167 --> 28:36.083
- Okay, so yoga's getting going
on the bridge deck.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.750
But we also have half
the guests at the table.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.250
So do you want to put out

28:40.250 --> 28:41.667
some warm food
for the non-yoga people?

28:41.667 --> 28:43.000
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.333
- How many of them're
back there?

28:44.333 --> 28:46.917
- Three, and the primary
might finally come out,

28:46.917 --> 28:48.042
so possibly four.

28:48.042 --> 28:49.292
- Okay. Done.

28:55.875 --> 28:57.333
- Would you like
some bacon, Scott?

28:57.333 --> 28:59.667
- I mean, does Paula Deen
like butter? Yeah.

28:59.667 --> 29:01.083
- Absolutely.

29:01.083 --> 29:02.333
- Empty your lungs,

29:02.333 --> 29:05.375
looking softly
over your left shoulder.

29:07.917 --> 29:10.708
- How are you guys doing?
You want more of anything?

29:10.708 --> 29:12.250
- No, we're good.
- Everything's perfect.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.917
- Great.

29:14.917 --> 29:16.833
- How are they? Are they happy?
- Yeah, they're really happy.

29:16.833 --> 29:18.625
The three are done
with their breakfast,

29:18.625 --> 29:19.958
and then we're just waiting
for yoga to finish,

29:19.958 --> 29:22.125
so we have kind of
a breakfast halftime.

29:22.125 --> 29:23.792
- Is this breakfast
or brunch?

29:23.792 --> 29:25.125
- It's their first meal
of the day.

29:25.125 --> 29:26.958
- Well, what are we calling it?
What is it?

29:26.958 --> 29:28.292
- I'm calling it
their first meal of the day.

29:28.292 --> 29:30.125
I don't like labels.

29:30.125 --> 29:31.792
- Well, I do,
because it gives me structure.

29:31.792 --> 29:33.792
- I think you're losing sight
of the fact

29:33.792 --> 29:35.875
that there's a lot of other

29:35.875 --> 29:37.708
things that are going on--
- I'm losing sight of the fact

29:37.708 --> 29:39.625
that I don't know
what the hell's going on, ever.

29:39.625 --> 29:40.958
- Here we go again.

29:40.958 --> 29:42.917
I wish he could
just keep it together.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.917
- I want to know if they're
having brunch or breakfast.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.292
- I would love
to ask the primary,

29:47.292 --> 29:48.750
but like I've told you
four times,

29:48.750 --> 29:50.625
she's locked herself
in her bedroom.

29:50.625 --> 29:52.083
The other four
are doing yoga,

29:52.083 --> 29:53.875
so I'm not gonna go
ruin their downward dog

29:53.875 --> 29:55.250
and be like,
"Excuse me, excuse me."

29:55.250 --> 29:57.292
- I'm not asking you
to do that.

29:57.292 --> 30:00.167
- I'm not talking to you
until you calm down.

30:00.167 --> 30:03.458
- She could be one of
the worst people in the world.

30:04.750 --> 30:05.917
- Coming up...

30:05.917 --> 30:07.667
- It would be nice
if everyone knew

30:07.667 --> 30:10.458
when the guests were gonna eat,
'cause I'm not psychic.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.125
- It is breakfast.
- Kate, Ben--hold it down.

30:12.125 --> 30:13.667
I can hear you guys up here
in the bridge.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.208
- Mommy and Daddy
need to stop fighting.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.667
- Hi.
- How was it?

30:23.667 --> 30:24.792
- Good.

30:24.792 --> 30:26.667
- You guys want to sit down?

30:26.667 --> 30:28.833
We can bring out some bacon
and sausage and French toast.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.833
- Eggs? Sure.
- Eggs. That would be perfect.

30:30.833 --> 30:32.833
- You guys don't have to join me
in this,

30:32.833 --> 30:35.750
but I'm spreading
my aunt's ashes at sundown,

30:35.750 --> 30:38.458
'cause it's the one-year
anniversary of her passing, so--

30:38.458 --> 30:40.292
- Yay!

30:40.292 --> 30:42.708
- I don't know if you're ready
to be in front of food.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.042
- Kelley, Kelley, Lee--
can I get you

30:44.042 --> 30:45.458
in the wheelhouse please?

30:45.458 --> 30:46.875
- En route.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.375
- What's up, Cap?

30:52.375 --> 30:53.958
- What the hell happened
with the pool

30:53.958 --> 30:56.000
floating away yesterday?
- Oh, my goodness.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.375
The pool is floating away.

30:58.375 --> 31:01.458
Okay, so...

31:01.458 --> 31:04.833
Kyle didn't get the line
attached anywhere.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.167
It was bad.
It just--

31:06.167 --> 31:07.958
- You needed to pay
more attention to the line.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.167
- Yeah.
- I'm tired

31:09.167 --> 31:10.875
of telling him
that his deck crew

31:10.875 --> 31:12.542
isn't living up to
expectations.

31:12.542 --> 31:15.333
It's just...fubar.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.458
- Okay.
- All right?

31:16.458 --> 31:18.042
- Anything else, Cap?
- Nope.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.375
- All right. Perfect.
- That's it. Thank you.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.042
- Can I get you
anything carbonated?

31:21.042 --> 31:24.083
- No, I'm okay.
- All right.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.792
- A little seasick.
I don't know how good I look.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.083
- We're gonna grab some flour
and do a test run up

31:31.083 --> 31:34.083
on the bridge deck aft.
- Okay.

31:34.083 --> 31:36.000
- Listen, if ashes are being
thrown off the boat,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.917
I sure in the f---
don't want them coming back

31:37.917 --> 31:39.375
and me--
getting them on me.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.417
This flour has lived its life
to the fullest.

31:41.417 --> 31:43.208
Good-bye, flour.
- That's perfect.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.958
- Oh, that's really perfect.
- That is perfect.

31:47.042 --> 31:48.750
- Yes. Beautiful.

31:48.750 --> 31:52.083
- Ugh!
Every f---ing time.

31:52.083 --> 31:54.542
- I don't understand
what the problem is.

31:54.542 --> 31:56.417
- It would be nice
if everyone knew

31:56.417 --> 31:58.250
when the guests were gonna eat,

31:58.250 --> 32:01.250
including the guests,
'cause I'm not psychic.

32:01.250 --> 32:04.000
- Ben is getting overly upset
for no reason.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.375
Again.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.292
- You didn't call this
an early dinner.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.375
- I don't think if I called it
the last meal of your life,

32:09.375 --> 32:11.542
that would prevent them
from becoming hungry later.

32:11.542 --> 32:14.125
What is your problem
at this moment?

32:14.125 --> 32:16.375
- I asked you if it was brunch
and you said,

32:16.375 --> 32:18.125
"Let's call it
the first meal of the day."

32:18.125 --> 32:20.750
- ♪ Dun dun dun ♪

32:20.750 --> 32:22.292
- I don't know why you think--
- It's always been breakfast,

32:22.292 --> 32:24.042
but I won't use
the word breakfast.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.792
I'll just say it's the first
meal of the day.

32:25.792 --> 32:27.125
- It is breakfast.
- Kate. Ben.

32:27.125 --> 32:28.917
Can you guys hold it down?
- Oh!

32:28.917 --> 32:30.083
- I can hear you guys up here
in the bridge.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.292
That means if I can hear you,

32:31.292 --> 32:33.458
somebody else
probably can as well.

32:33.458 --> 32:34.458
- Copy.

32:34.458 --> 32:36.917
This is so embarrassing.

32:36.917 --> 32:38.042
- Was that Captain Lee
saying...

32:38.042 --> 32:39.292
- Yes.
- "Stop yelling.

32:39.292 --> 32:40.958
They can all hear you."

32:40.958 --> 32:42.458
- I've never had that happen
in my life.

32:42.458 --> 32:44.792
- Mommy and Daddy
need to stop fighting.

32:44.792 --> 32:46.292
- Awkward.
- Oops.

32:46.292 --> 32:48.000
- How are you guys doing?
- Good, good.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.458
- Good.
- Can I get you anything?

32:49.458 --> 32:51.500
- I think we're good.
- Sorry, guys.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.333
- As long as the drinks
keep coming, we're fine.

32:53.333 --> 32:55.000
- We're so good.
- Okay, yeah.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.417
Sorry about that. Cheers.

32:56.417 --> 32:59.333
Em, I'm fed up
with Kate shouting at me.

32:59.333 --> 33:02.500
- I'm just not going
to breach that subject.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.000
- Me and Kate just drive
each other nuts.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
It's no real affliction
of either character.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.833
- When Ben and Kate
are fighting, you know,

33:09.833 --> 33:13.833
it crossed my mind that maybe
he still has feelings for Kate.

33:13.833 --> 33:16.000
- We're both very pigheaded.
Let's put it that way.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.833
- I get that. It's just not
comfortable being around it.

33:19.792 --> 33:21.167
- I'm sorry.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.083
Obviously, I do not want

33:23.083 --> 33:25.000
to fight with Kate
in front of Emily,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.958
because it's a very bad look.

33:26.958 --> 33:28.542
But Emily needs to understand,

33:28.542 --> 33:30.875
Kate is the most
difficult person to work with

33:30.875 --> 33:33.000
in the whole, entire world.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.875
- Okay, we're saying good-bye
to the great-aunt right now.

33:39.875 --> 33:41.875
- That's sweet.
- How crazy is this?

33:41.875 --> 33:43.042
I brought her
in a mint container.

33:43.042 --> 33:44.208
- Oh, my God.

33:44.208 --> 33:45.958
- Will you go up
to the sky lounge

33:45.958 --> 33:49.208
and grab me all the flowers
that don't look hideous?

33:49.208 --> 33:52.208
Scott wanting to spread
his aunt's ashes is super sweet,

33:52.208 --> 33:54.292
but it's awkward for me.

33:54.292 --> 33:57.542
I feel like it's private.
It's a burned body.

33:57.542 --> 33:59.208
- Oh, my God.
That is so beautiful.

33:59.208 --> 34:00.875
- I thought you could
put her in there.

34:00.875 --> 34:02.875
No? Or what kind of thing
do you want?

34:02.875 --> 34:04.875
- A shot glass like this one.
- Okay.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.000
- I love that.
- Okay, I'm gonna put her

34:07.000 --> 34:08.458
in there inside, just in case.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.083
- Thank God it's pretty windy.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.250
But if we do get ashes
on the deck,

34:12.250 --> 34:13.917
I'm gonna rinse her off.

34:13.917 --> 34:15.667
She'll go down the scuppers,
through the drain.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.500
Either way,
his aunt ends up in the ocean.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.417
- Aunt Grace kind of looks
like kitty litter.

34:19.417 --> 34:21.417
- I know.
- Her ashes are so smooth.

34:21.417 --> 34:23.167
- Yeah.
- My mom's were all, like,

34:23.167 --> 34:25.875
bones and sh--, like, chunky.

34:25.875 --> 34:28.417
- Granular?
- I just feel the juju.

34:28.417 --> 34:29.667
There's juju in the place.

34:29.667 --> 34:33.542
Look at all the, like, juju.
Juju.

34:33.542 --> 34:36.000
- I have a feeling this
is gonna be a terrible idea.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.917
- You will help me figure out
the wind situation, so...

34:37.917 --> 34:40.083
- You're actually coming
into the right swing here, in--

34:40.083 --> 34:41.417
- In about two minutes.
- Yeah.

34:41.417 --> 34:42.667
- It would be very her

34:42.667 --> 34:44.083
to come back
and hit us in the face.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.917
Like, that's--
I'm not kidding.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.500
- That's how it works.
Because we're multi-dimensions.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.167
There's only life after life.

34:50.167 --> 34:51.583
- All right.

34:51.583 --> 34:53.292
So, she was my godmother,

34:53.292 --> 34:55.250
my aunt, and my best friend,

34:55.250 --> 34:57.083
and she said to take her ashes

34:57.083 --> 34:59.542
and spread them in all
the fabulous places that I go,

34:59.542 --> 35:01.458
and what's more fabulous
than this?

35:01.458 --> 35:03.458
So, this one's for Aunt Grace.

35:03.458 --> 35:04.958
God bless and spare you.

35:04.958 --> 35:08.042
- Yay!

35:09.125 --> 35:10.125
- That went well.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.625
- Thank you.
Thank you guys.

35:11.625 --> 35:13.542
It was so sweet for you
to put that together for me.

35:13.542 --> 35:14.625
- No problem.

35:14.625 --> 35:15.625
- Thanks
for letting us join you.

35:15.625 --> 35:17.250
To Aunt Grace.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.125
- Sorry about that.
- You yelled at me a lot.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.417
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Okay. It's okay.

35:29.417 --> 35:31.125
- It's behind
you now, right?

35:31.125 --> 35:33.125
- Yeah. I would prefer
to not even talk about it...

35:33.125 --> 35:35.000
- Yeah.
- Like, from right now on.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.292
At first I thought
being in a happy relationship

35:37.292 --> 35:39.000
would be great
for his attitude,

35:39.000 --> 35:40.667
but Ben is being more
of a jerk,

35:40.667 --> 35:42.417
and it's just really annoying.

35:42.417 --> 35:44.167
- Sometimes it feels good,
though, you know, just to--

35:44.167 --> 35:47.458
- We all express our rage
in different ways, Ben.

35:59.333 --> 36:02.292
- Oh, how beautiful!
After you, lovely.

36:02.292 --> 36:03.667
- Do you usually work
with music in your kitchen?

36:03.667 --> 36:05.667
- With losers in the kitchen,
did you say?

36:05.667 --> 36:08.167
- Music.
- I'm just playing.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.500
No, it's a joke.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.333
- Ben, the guests are headed
to the table.

36:11.333 --> 36:14.667
- Salmon sashimi. Sesame oil.
Spicy mayo. Spring onions.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.542
- Yeah, you've got it.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.375
- My compliments to the chef.

36:25.667 --> 36:28.042
- Oh, do you hear that?
- Yeah, I can hear that.

36:28.042 --> 36:30.625
Oof. I would be careful

36:30.625 --> 36:31.708
standing over here.

36:31.708 --> 36:33.208
- Have you gone as well?
- Yeah.

36:33.208 --> 36:34.708
- We just double
tapped at the same time.

36:34.708 --> 36:37.375
- Yes. Oosh! Oosh!
- We're on the same cycle.

36:37.375 --> 36:39.500
- We're on the same
farting cycle.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.042
Oh, my God. Stop.

36:42.042 --> 36:44.208
- Will you go help Sierra
with turndowns?

36:44.208 --> 36:45.667
- Yeah.
- Ben, is that prime rib?

36:45.667 --> 36:47.083
- No, it's filet.

36:48.167 --> 36:49.542
- Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

36:49.542 --> 36:52.333
That looks beautiful.
- You're welcome.

36:52.333 --> 36:54.042
- I'd love a psychic reading.

36:54.042 --> 36:55.542
- Maybe I should do it.
- I don't know.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.083
- I want to ask,

36:57.083 --> 36:59.417
but I'm scared
what she would say.

36:59.417 --> 37:00.750
- I'm a psychic for sure.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.500
But I'm like
a scientist also.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.750
I know how to connect to heaven.
Heaven has technology.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.250
I have absolute
scientific proof.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.583
I have a lot of celebrities--

37:07.583 --> 37:10.250
Jim Morrison,
Marilyn Monroe,

37:10.250 --> 37:12.583
Alfred Hitchcock.
He's a little perverted.

37:12.583 --> 37:14.500
Very perverted, actually.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.083
But I might create a phone
that can go multidimensional.

37:17.083 --> 37:18.250
- Wow.
- Yeah.

37:18.250 --> 37:20.583
I have 600 phone calls
from Heaven

37:20.583 --> 37:22.583
on my phone
that I actually have here.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.250
- She can't leave a message
'cause there's no more room.

37:24.250 --> 37:25.583
- No, there's no more room.

37:25.583 --> 37:27.583
- You hear a lot of weird stuff
in yachting.

37:27.583 --> 37:29.375
- But then God came to me,
and I asked him all this stuff.

37:29.375 --> 37:31.250
He said I was exactly right.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.208
- And this is officially the
strangest thing I've ever heard.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.083
- I smashed it.
- As always.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.125
- I just smashed it.
- What's next?

37:39.125 --> 37:40.417
- I think that's it.

37:40.417 --> 37:42.125
- Good night.
See you guys tomorrow.

37:42.125 --> 37:43.375
- Sleep well.
- I sure will.

37:43.375 --> 37:44.708
I'm very tired.

37:44.708 --> 37:46.375
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.

37:46.375 --> 37:48.292
- Hey, Emily?
- Yes?

37:48.292 --> 37:49.750
- Cindy said she would
totally sit down with you

37:49.750 --> 37:51.458
if you want to chat
and do a quick reading.

37:51.458 --> 37:54.250
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Come on, come on, come on.

37:54.250 --> 37:56.208
- Do you want to come sit down?
- Okay.

37:58.417 --> 37:59.667
- Yeah.

38:05.792 --> 38:07.375
- Yeah.

38:07.375 --> 38:09.750
- So, um, Cindy?
- Yes, sir.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.292
- Do me and Ems have a future?

38:15.250 --> 38:19.208
- Oh, man. I feel like
I'm being...bombarded.

38:19.208 --> 38:21.125
Are you--
okay.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.667
- I'm just asking here.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.625
- Do you really want me
to do this?

38:25.625 --> 38:28.333
No, I'm not doing it.
I'm sorry. I'm not doing it.

38:28.333 --> 38:30.750
I'm just--
I'm not.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.167
- Coming up...

38:32.167 --> 38:33.167
- The little love life
going on here.

38:33.167 --> 38:34.667
Don't worry.

38:34.667 --> 38:36.167
There's some good stuff
going on there.

38:36.167 --> 38:37.667
- Was she looking
at Kate and Ben

38:37.667 --> 38:39.292
or Ben and I?

38:43.875 --> 38:44.333
- Cindy?

38:44.083 --> 38:44.333
- Yes, sir.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.583
- Do me and Ems have a future?

38:50.333 --> 38:53.750
- Oh, man, I feel like
I'm being bombarded.

38:53.750 --> 38:56.167
- I'm just asking a question.
- Are you--okay.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.958
- I'm just asking you.

38:59.417 --> 39:00.667
- Do you really want me
to do this?

39:00.667 --> 39:02.708
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not doing it.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.542
I'm sorry. I'm not doing it.

39:06.208 --> 39:08.542
- I don't know everything.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

39:08.542 --> 39:10.458
I thought you were psychic.

39:10.458 --> 39:11.833
- I am psychic.
Doesn't mean I know everything.

39:11.833 --> 39:13.875
- I think Ben talking
to any guest

39:13.875 --> 39:15.500
like this is not rational.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.542
You know,
it's really unprofessional

39:16.542 --> 39:17.625
for him to do that.

39:17.625 --> 39:18.542
- I don't want to do this.

39:18.542 --> 39:20.167
- You don't have to do it.

39:20.167 --> 39:21.458
Thank you so much.

39:21.458 --> 39:22.875
I feel like
it's very inappropriate.

39:22.875 --> 39:24.375
Not only Cindy's
being put on the spot,

39:24.375 --> 39:26.208
but I've been put on the spot,

39:26.208 --> 39:28.875
and our relationship
is being put on the spot.

39:28.875 --> 39:30.875
Ben pushes it and pushes it.

39:30.875 --> 39:32.667
- I'm really just asking
whether you think Ems

39:32.667 --> 39:34.333
and I can work out.

39:34.333 --> 39:35.833
- Do you want me to be
blatantly honest with you?

39:35.833 --> 39:37.375
- Yeah.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.292
- No, I don't.

39:42.667 --> 39:44.500
- Okay.

39:44.500 --> 39:47.833
Hey, Ems, do you want to go
on a date tomorrow night?

39:47.833 --> 39:49.375
I'd really like that.

39:50.875 --> 39:53.417
- I would love to join you
on a date tomorrow night.

39:53.417 --> 39:55.250
- Okay.
Brilliant.

39:55.250 --> 39:56.750
- Well, obviously,
I'm going to say yes.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.375
I'd like to go on
a second date with him,

39:58.375 --> 39:59.667
but I don't like
the circumstances

39:59.667 --> 40:01.417
he's asked me under,

40:01.417 --> 40:04.917
and I feel under pressure
and out of sorts.

40:04.917 --> 40:06.875
- I'll see you in the morning.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.375
- I'll probably see you
in a few minutes.

40:08.375 --> 40:09.833
- I'll see you
in the morning too.

40:09.833 --> 40:10.917
- Fantastic.

40:10.917 --> 40:12.042
Don't poison my coffee.

40:13.042 --> 40:15.333
- Lovely chatting with you.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.542
- Are you okay there?
That was pretty intense.

40:23.542 --> 40:26.458
Like, that was just such an
uncomfortable situation for you.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.083
- Absolutely ridiculous.

40:28.083 --> 40:29.625
If that was me, I would've been
really uncomfortable,

40:29.625 --> 40:31.458
and I would've been like,
are you serious?

40:31.458 --> 40:32.917
We've been on one date--
like, why are you requesting,

40:32.917 --> 40:35.042
like, couples counseling
sort of stuff?

40:35.042 --> 40:36.958
Anyway, night, Em.
Have a good sleep.

40:50.542 --> 40:51.750
I don't know what's happening,

40:51.750 --> 40:53.458
but you know,
I thought I had

40:53.458 --> 40:55.083
a good relationship with Kate
throughout the season,

40:55.083 --> 40:57.750
and all of a sudden
she's sort of not talking,

40:57.750 --> 40:59.625
doing that whole stewardess
guest smile face,

40:59.625 --> 41:00.875
but I can see through it.

41:07.167 --> 41:10.000
- Whoa. Whoa.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.500
"Very intense
and interesting night."

41:12.500 --> 41:13.917
- That was my fault.

41:13.917 --> 41:15.500
- "Oh, you'll hear all about
last night

41:15.500 --> 41:17.083
"and Ben's fab,
spontaneous question.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.583
Feeling slightly out of sorts.
Going to bed."

41:19.583 --> 41:22.917
- Sad face.
- What did you do?

41:22.917 --> 41:25.083
- I just did, you know,
what Benny does.

41:25.083 --> 41:29.833
I asked one of the psychics if
she could ever see marrying us.

41:31.333 --> 41:33.500
- Why did you do that?
What'd she say?

41:33.500 --> 41:35.458
- It was spontaneous.
What can I say?

41:35.458 --> 41:37.333
- It was stupid.
- Kate, go back to bed.

41:37.333 --> 41:38.667
You're already annoying me.

41:38.667 --> 41:40.333
You've been up
for about three minutes.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.500
Of course she's gonna say
it was inappropriate

41:42.500 --> 41:46.667
and it was wrong of me
to challenge a medium.

41:46.667 --> 41:48.667
I just thought
that's what they were there for.

41:48.667 --> 41:50.667
- Then did it go well?
- No.

41:50.667 --> 41:52.625
- Well, then
that was pretty stupid.

41:52.625 --> 41:54.542
- I don't regret it, okay?

41:54.542 --> 41:55.833
- Okay, let's start
bringing it in.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.000
- Okay, Cap.
Taking chain.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.625
- Roger that.
Let's get it up.

41:59.875 --> 42:01.542
- Okay, we're off the bottom.

42:01.542 --> 42:02.875
- We're off the bottom, Cap.

42:05.792 --> 42:07.042
- Beautiful day.
- I feel alive.

42:07.042 --> 42:08.708
- Well,
and now we're ruined forever.

42:08.708 --> 42:12.208
To ever get on a catamaran
is gonna just be like...

42:12.208 --> 42:13.875
- Yeah, now I can't
ever get on a boat.

42:16.208 --> 42:18.042
- Please, genuinely.
- Yeah.

42:18.042 --> 42:19.125
Well, you have me
on Twitter, right?

42:19.125 --> 42:20.667
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

42:25.958 --> 42:28.792
- We had the time of our life
this weekend. Like, seriously.

42:28.792 --> 42:31.208
- Fresh orange juice?
- Yes.

42:31.208 --> 42:33.667
The chocolate croissant things
are exquisite.

42:33.667 --> 42:35.000
- I'm gonna bring it to a stop

42:35.000 --> 42:36.792
and move out
to the wing station.

42:39.417 --> 42:41.542
- Cap, you got 50 feet,
starboard side.

42:41.542 --> 42:43.167
Two sailboats.

42:43.167 --> 42:44.750
- All righty. Let's do this.

42:49.875 --> 42:51.917
Hey, Captain, if you can
kick it in one more time,

42:51.917 --> 42:53.000
that'd be great.

42:55.500 --> 42:58.083
- That looks good right there.
Lock it in.

42:59.583 --> 43:01.583
- Are these bags ready?
- This one is.

43:01.583 --> 43:03.083
- This is all just Speedos.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.250
- Yes.
- Yeah.

43:06.708 --> 43:09.583
- How'd you sleep?
- Oh, not bad.

43:09.583 --> 43:12.042
Last night was kind of weird.

43:12.042 --> 43:13.917
- Yeah.
- Sorry about that.

43:13.917 --> 43:15.250
I was just hoping she'd say,

43:15.250 --> 43:16.750
"Yeah, you guys
are good together," but...

43:16.750 --> 43:19.208
- No, no, no.
Course not.

43:19.208 --> 43:21.042
- Line it up, guys.

43:22.958 --> 43:26.792
- Thank you.
You're like, "Get off. Get off."

43:26.792 --> 43:28.625
- Emerson.
- Nico, thank you so much.

43:28.625 --> 43:29.958
- Thank you.
- A pleasure meeting you.

43:29.958 --> 43:31.750
Great to meet you guys.
Scott.

43:31.750 --> 43:32.917
- Been an absolute pleasure.

43:32.917 --> 43:34.208
- You were the best crew ever.

43:34.208 --> 43:36.250
And, hey,
you were great in the storm.

43:36.250 --> 43:38.125
I like
a little adventure and drama.

43:38.125 --> 43:40.708
And I have a little
gratitude here for you guys.

43:40.708 --> 43:42.125
Every penny of it was worth it.

43:42.125 --> 43:43.542
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

43:43.542 --> 43:45.542
- And the love life
going on here--

43:45.542 --> 43:48.125
I won't expose it completely.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.958
Don't worry. There's some
good stuff going on there.

43:50.958 --> 43:54.000
And thank you
for being open to psychics

43:54.000 --> 43:55.500
and what we had to do.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.500
So, okay, all right.

43:57.500 --> 43:59.750
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

43:59.750 --> 44:03.000
- I'm really glad
the witches are leaving.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.292
- Let's go to work.

44:10.167 --> 44:13.333
- This morning when Rebecca
on the aft deck, said,

44:13.333 --> 44:15.167
"I can see, like--"
- Good things.

44:15.167 --> 44:20.083
- Yeah. Was she looking
at Kate and Ben or Ben and I?

44:20.083 --> 44:21.958
- I think you and Ben.

44:21.958 --> 44:24.500
Do you think
he's not over her?

44:24.500 --> 44:26.625
- I know
he's not over something.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.625
- I think he really
likes you, Em.

44:28.625 --> 44:31.958
Like, he's smitten with you.
- Mmm.

44:31.958 --> 44:33.000
- Coming up...

44:36.625 --> 44:38.542
- You're so sweet.
It's unbelievable.

44:38.542 --> 44:39.750
- Mm-hmm.

44:51.542 --> 44:53.208
- Hey, Ben.
You're obviously calling me

44:53.208 --> 44:56.167
'cause you just blew up
the galley again, did you?

44:56.167 --> 44:57.833
- No, no, James. How are you?

44:59.333 --> 45:01.208
- Oh, you're busy.
Okay, good.

45:02.875 --> 45:06.000
Well, that's lame.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.125
James is my older brother.
I've always looked up to him.

45:09.125 --> 45:13.542
My life at sea has been
a bit of a mystery to my family.

45:13.542 --> 45:14.875
- What's going on?

45:14.875 --> 45:16.208
- Listen, I thought
it would be really cool

45:16.208 --> 45:18.167
if you came out and visited me.

45:18.167 --> 45:21.917
- And why did you come
to that rash conclusion?

45:21.917 --> 45:25.750
- Well...well, I miss you,
and it could be a good time.

45:25.750 --> 45:27.000
- Yeah. Sure.
Let's do it.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.875
- Well, I'll see you soon, okay?

45:28.875 --> 45:30.042
- Okay.
- Bye, mate.

45:30.042 --> 45:31.708
- Okay.

45:31.708 --> 45:32.708
- Attention, all crew.

45:32.708 --> 45:33.917
Attention, all crew.

45:33.917 --> 45:36.208
I need you in the crew mess
in five.

45:36.208 --> 45:37.750
Crew mess in five.

45:37.750 --> 45:39.083
- Scooch over, please.
- Yeah.

45:39.083 --> 45:41.167
- Do you mind?
I get a little claustrophobic.

45:41.167 --> 45:44.167
- Okay. Another one done.

45:45.667 --> 45:47.583
Um, deck crew...

45:47.583 --> 45:50.333
you kind of had a good,
bad, and ugly charter.

45:50.333 --> 45:54.750
You guys just can't seem to get
it together with the pool.

45:54.750 --> 45:56.917
It's floating away.

45:56.917 --> 45:58.375
Kyle, you own that one.

46:00.042 --> 46:02.917
You should've caught
the pool floating away.

46:02.917 --> 46:04.250
I mean, too little, too late.

46:11.042 --> 46:12.875
- Nico's stepping into places

46:12.875 --> 46:14.792
where he probably shouldn't
when it comes to talking.

46:14.792 --> 46:16.292
This isn't the place.

46:16.292 --> 46:17.792
If you want to talk about it,

46:17.792 --> 46:18.958
you can talk about it
with me and Captain,

46:18.958 --> 46:20.125
but not here.

46:20.125 --> 46:22.708
- Just really,
really pay attention.

46:22.708 --> 46:24.625
Interior.

46:24.625 --> 46:27.083
I noticed a disturbance
in the galley.

46:27.083 --> 46:29.708
I really don't care
what prompted it.

46:29.708 --> 46:31.292
I just don't want it,

46:31.292 --> 46:33.083
and that's all
I'm gonna say about it.

46:33.083 --> 46:34.083
- Won't happen again.

46:36.042 --> 46:37.708
- We have cash to divide up.

46:37.708 --> 46:43.000
$1,350 for each of us.
15,000 is the total tip.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.167
- Ooh.
- Thank you.

46:45.167 --> 46:47.250
- Sierra.

46:47.250 --> 46:49.667
- Cheers, Cap.

46:49.667 --> 46:51.833
- Thank you very much.
- Em. Nico.

46:51.833 --> 46:53.250
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

46:53.250 --> 46:55.667
- Thank you very much.
- Enjoy your afternoon.

46:55.667 --> 46:57.667
Remember, tomorrow's a work day
and a hard one.

47:03.125 --> 47:04.833
- Hey, bro,

47:04.833 --> 47:07.000
you stood by me.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.667
- It's like I stuck up for you,
and Kelley didn't like it.

47:12.458 --> 47:14.167
As soon as I said it,
he was like,

47:14.167 --> 47:17.167
"What the f---
is going on?"

47:17.167 --> 47:19.333
What happened happened,
and I saw it happen.

47:19.333 --> 47:21.792
And I'm not gonna let you get
thrown under the bus for it.

47:25.958 --> 47:28.208
- I'm f---ing tired.
I'm gonna faint tonight.

47:28.208 --> 47:30.375
- I'm with you.
I'm exhausted.

47:33.958 --> 47:36.833
- I'm really excited to go
on this second date with Emily,

47:36.833 --> 47:38.375
because I'd love
to prove to her

47:38.375 --> 47:42.167
that whatever the psychic
said was absolute bollocks.

47:42.167 --> 47:44.167
I really like your outfit.

47:44.167 --> 47:45.792
- Oh, thank you.
- Really cool.

47:45.792 --> 47:49.333
I do feel that there is a future
for me and Emily.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.958
- Oh, I like it here.
- Do you?

47:54.292 --> 47:56.458
Yeah, two glasses
of champagne, please.

47:56.458 --> 47:58.208
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

47:58.208 --> 48:01.792
- This is so nice to just--
- To just go out for dinner?

48:01.792 --> 48:05.250
- Away from the crazies.
- It's quite nice. I like it.

48:05.250 --> 48:07.500
- It really is.

48:11.083 --> 48:13.208
- It's a full moon tonight.

48:13.208 --> 48:15.833
You know what that means?
- What does it mean?

48:15.833 --> 48:18.375
- I don't know.
- Cool.

48:18.375 --> 48:19.917
- What are you doing?

48:19.917 --> 48:21.708
- Oh, my God.
I'm horny already.

48:21.708 --> 48:23.333
- Babe,
I'm not having Skype sex.

48:23.333 --> 48:25.250
- Why the f--- not?
- I'm just not.

48:25.250 --> 48:29.083
- What the f---, Kate?
I'm super horny.

48:29.083 --> 48:30.917
- Vagina.
- Vagina.

48:30.917 --> 48:32.083
- Oh, wow, thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

48:32.083 --> 48:33.875
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

48:33.875 --> 48:37.000
- I didn't give the psychic
too hard a time, did I?

48:37.000 --> 48:39.333
You know what it was, Ems?
I feel like we're good together,

48:39.333 --> 48:42.333
and I just got this girl saying
that it's not gonna work out.

48:42.333 --> 48:44.250
It was like, oh, well, thanks.

48:44.250 --> 48:46.792
- It was a funny situation.
Never gonna happen again.

48:46.792 --> 48:48.292
It's mainly that we shared
the experience

48:48.292 --> 48:50.083
with each other, you know?

48:50.083 --> 48:52.292
- Yeah. That's a good way
of looking at it, Ems.

48:52.292 --> 48:54.250
- It's nice getting to know you.

48:54.250 --> 48:55.917
- Well.
- You're interesting.

48:55.917 --> 48:57.958
You're funny.
- I can be, I guess.

49:00.125 --> 49:02.958
Let's go for a stroll, shall we?
- Okay, let's go for a stroll.

49:02.958 --> 49:04.208
- Yeah. We can even grab
a little drink

49:04.208 --> 49:05.292
down at the beach bar.

49:05.292 --> 49:06.375
I'm still standing.
- Okay.

49:06.375 --> 49:08.042
Ben's very relaxed.

49:08.042 --> 49:09.542
He's in a different place
from work.

49:09.542 --> 49:11.792
He's settled,
and he's a true gentleman.

49:11.792 --> 49:15.375
- I think we need, like,
a private violinist

49:15.375 --> 49:17.083
that I'm gonna summon.

49:19.042 --> 49:21.917
- You've got the hiccups?

49:21.917 --> 49:23.792
- I'm starting to hiccup.
- You're so sweet.

49:23.792 --> 49:25.417
It's unbelievable.

49:25.417 --> 49:27.125
Okay, do you know
a trick for it?

49:27.125 --> 49:30.167
- Mm-hmm, I'm holding my breath.
- Here.

49:40.917 --> 49:42.458
- It worked.
- Did it really work?

49:42.458 --> 49:46.208
- I think so.
- We just cured hiccups.

49:57.958 --> 50:00.083
- Hey, Kate.
- Hey, guys. How are you?

50:00.083 --> 50:01.833
- We went to Old Peg Leg's.
- Yeah, it was good.

50:01.833 --> 50:03.500
- Cool.
- I'm gonna go to the loo.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.958
Are you gonna be around?

50:04.958 --> 50:06.292
- Yeah, yeah.

50:06.292 --> 50:09.125
They're, like,
on a cloud of happiness.

50:09.125 --> 50:13.292
Yay. Ben redeemed himself.
Let's just hope it lasts.

50:13.292 --> 50:15.625
- It is hot.
- No, you're fine.

50:15.625 --> 50:18.375
It's nice.
You're rosy.

50:18.375 --> 50:20.208
But you've got great skin,
though.

50:20.208 --> 50:21.875
- Ben.
- What?

50:21.875 --> 50:24.542
- If your game was any sharper,
I'd shave with it.

50:24.542 --> 50:25.875
- Dude, that boy
has got a future.

50:25.875 --> 50:27.208
I promise you.

50:27.208 --> 50:28.667
He was a f---ing

50:28.667 --> 50:31.458
homeless street performer
in London for how long?

50:31.458 --> 50:33.042
- I've been doing street
performing around the world,

50:33.042 --> 50:34.917
really,
when I was traveling.

50:36.875 --> 50:38.500
- Come on, then.

50:40.625 --> 50:42.167
- Did it work?

50:43.458 --> 50:44.875
- That's him, right?
Is that you?

50:44.875 --> 50:45.875
- That's me.
- That's you.

50:45.875 --> 50:47.375
- On the left.

50:49.375 --> 50:50.542
- Wow.

50:50.542 --> 50:53.333
Those shorts are really...

50:53.333 --> 50:55.042
- Revealing.
- Honest.

50:56.417 --> 51:01.542
- So many dudes, though.
- Gay pride. 2010.

51:01.542 --> 51:03.083
- Look at those moves.

51:04.917 --> 51:07.375
- I was living in Manchester
about 2010.

51:07.375 --> 51:09.167
You know, they invite you
to dance on the stage

51:09.167 --> 51:10.583
in front of thousands
of people.

51:10.583 --> 51:12.250
I was like,
yeah, let's do it.

51:12.250 --> 51:15.417
So the video is basically me
dancing around

51:15.417 --> 51:17.375
in some very revealing
silver hot pants.

51:17.375 --> 51:19.708
And, by the way, they're very
revealing in a good way.

51:19.708 --> 51:21.583
I came out to my dad
to this song.

51:23.208 --> 51:24.208
- Oh, my God.

51:31.250 --> 51:31.542
- Oh, my God.

51:32.250 --> 51:33.625
Whoa.

51:33.625 --> 51:34.708
We're both gay?

51:34.708 --> 51:36.542
- Is that how I should do it?

51:36.542 --> 51:38.292
- And what did you say
to your dad?

51:38.292 --> 51:40.083
"I'm gay now," or what?

51:43.750 --> 51:45.292
- Hmm?

51:45.292 --> 51:46.292
Kyle was very much courting
Sierra,

51:46.292 --> 51:47.583
and to be honest,

51:47.583 --> 51:50.708
I did not see this coming
whatsoever.

51:50.708 --> 51:54.375
I think 'cause it--
I mean, he's not, um--

51:54.375 --> 51:57.125
- Okay. So you were dating
somebody that was transgender?

51:57.125 --> 51:59.125
Did you know that
when you met them?

51:59.125 --> 52:02.458
- Yeah, I used to go out
to bars, looking for it.

52:02.458 --> 52:04.708
- Looking for what?

52:04.708 --> 52:06.792
Wait, what? I missed it.
I'm sorry, man.

52:06.792 --> 52:08.583
- No. What happened was,
I was in the army.

52:08.583 --> 52:10.625
One night, I hooked up
with one by accident.

52:10.625 --> 52:12.125
- What, a transgender?
- Yeah, yeah.

52:12.125 --> 52:13.625
- Okay. Sure. Absolutely.

52:13.625 --> 52:17.750
- And then I found out
that I was a bit partial to it.

52:17.750 --> 52:20.333
So I went with it, then.
- Amazing.

52:22.250 --> 52:23.625
Through experience,

52:23.625 --> 52:26.667
I knew I'd like
effeminate gays and girls.

52:26.667 --> 52:28.167
So I thought I was bisexual.

52:28.167 --> 52:29.792
I was still struggling
with that factor.

52:29.792 --> 52:31.500
And then it came to the fact
that I realized

52:31.500 --> 52:33.208
that I quite liked trans.

52:34.250 --> 52:35.458
- Who's Ashley?

52:37.792 --> 52:39.375
- What, so she has a--

52:41.167 --> 52:42.792
- I don't know what you--
well, I know what you mean,

52:42.792 --> 52:44.500
but I don't know what you mean,
but it's like--

52:44.500 --> 52:46.167
- And that works for you
as well?

52:46.167 --> 52:47.333
- It don't bother me.
Well, it is what it is.

52:47.333 --> 52:49.000
- I am very fond of Kyle,

52:49.000 --> 52:50.500
and I shouldn't be prying
at his love life,

52:50.500 --> 52:53.167
but, you know, I like to know
about many things,

52:53.167 --> 52:56.333
and this is an area
that I'm really not very,

52:56.333 --> 52:58.375
you know, brushed up on.

52:58.375 --> 53:01.167
Yeah, but do you dabble?
- Not really.

53:01.167 --> 53:02.708
I go out with
proper leathered.

53:02.708 --> 53:04.458
- Oh, yeah.
You've got to be pretty. Yeah.

53:06.708 --> 53:08.458
- Ashley is someone
that I've been seeing

53:08.458 --> 53:09.542
on and off for a couple years.

53:09.542 --> 53:10.833
I met her outside a nightclub

53:10.833 --> 53:11.833
in the gay village
in Manchester.

53:11.833 --> 53:13.208
It was around the time

53:13.208 --> 53:14.292
that me
and the mother of my child

53:14.292 --> 53:15.625
were falling out,

53:15.625 --> 53:16.833
and the relationship
was completely done.

53:16.833 --> 53:19.208
- F--- me.
That's nuts.

53:19.208 --> 53:20.375
- You're so evolved.
- Yeah, good job.

53:20.375 --> 53:22.708
- Yeah.
- Evolved, yeah.

53:22.708 --> 53:24.375
That's a good word for it.

53:24.375 --> 53:26.333
You're full of surprises,
aren't you?

53:27.625 --> 53:29.500
- I knew I liked you.

53:30.667 --> 53:32.208
- Next on "Below Deck"...

53:32.208 --> 53:33.792
- Last night I showed Ben
some videos of me.

53:33.792 --> 53:35.375
It was gay pride.

53:36.792 --> 53:38.167
- Are you joking
or are you serious?

53:38.167 --> 53:40.333
- What?
- Number seven.

53:40.333 --> 53:42.583
They have planned
a surprise drag show.

53:42.583 --> 53:44.542
- It's about a good handful.
- Do you guys want me to leave?

53:44.542 --> 53:47.208
- Jack!

53:47.208 --> 53:48.583
- This conch is a bit chewy.

53:48.583 --> 53:50.250
- It tastes like
conch-flavored chewing gum.

53:50.250 --> 53:51.750
- I don't think
I can serve that.

53:51.750 --> 53:54.083
What do you think, Em?
- I'd be okay with it.

53:54.083 --> 53:56.208
- All right. Let's just put
the conch out, okay?

53:56.208 --> 53:58.250
- Her answer is wrong.

53:58.250 --> 53:59.708
- Hey, Kyle.

53:59.708 --> 54:02.375
- What is it?
- Sea urchin.

54:02.375 --> 54:04.250
What do you think?
You're a bit light-headed.

54:04.250 --> 54:06.542
- You just let us know
if your throat starts swelling.

54:06.542 --> 54:08.250
- You had an allergic reaction
to sea urchin?

54:08.250 --> 54:10.250
- Yeah.
- Sit down.

54:10.250 --> 54:12.417
- Is he passed out?
- He's in a coma.

54:12.417 --> 54:14.750
- It's because		 you		 gave him uni!

54:14.750 --> 54:17.792
