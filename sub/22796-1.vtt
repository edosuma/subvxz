Excited, Ricky?

00:33.951 --> 00:36.578
Oh, yeah!

00:36.662 --> 00:38.664
Oh, well, if

00:36.662 --> 00:38.664
it isn't the dickiest,

00:38.747 --> 00:41.750
dumbiest fucking people

00:38.747 --> 00:41.750
on the planet of the Earth!

00:41.834 --> 00:43.168
Where's the fucking van?

00:45.379 --> 00:47.923
Fuck, boys, I am losing

00:45.379 --> 00:47.923

00:48.007 --> 00:50.258
Why aren't you

00:48.007 --> 00:50.258
guys excited?

00:50.342 --> 00:52.678
This is gonna be way fucking

00:50.342 --> 00:52.678
better than the last time.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.013
It fucking

00:52.761 --> 00:54.013
better be, Bubs.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.681
Like, it has to be.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.681
It's gonna be,

00:55.764 --> 00:57.641
'cause I negotiated

00:55.764 --> 00:57.641
the fucking thing.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.185
You negotiated...

00:57.725 --> 01:00.185
What the fuck

00:57.725 --> 01:00.185
did you negotiate?

01:00.268 --> 01:02.521
I negotiated a fuck of

01:00.268 --> 01:02.521
a lot more than you did.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.606
Whatever.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.606
We're not on a tour

01:02.604 --> 01:04.606
bus, at least.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.149
We're going

01:04.690 --> 01:06.149
on fucking airplanes

01:06.233 --> 01:07.860
and we got

01:06.233 --> 01:07.860
our own hotel rooms.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.444
That's pretty

01:07.943 --> 01:09.444
fucking good, actually.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.822
I made them a fucking

01:09.528 --> 01:11.822
wishlist of places

01:11.906 --> 01:14.033
we might want to see.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.910
Per diems are coming to us.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.828
This is gonna be

01:15.993 --> 01:17.828
fucking unbelievable.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.705
What?

01:17.912 --> 01:19.705
And Swearnet sent

01:17.912 --> 01:19.705
me this shirt.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.290
Look at this.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.290
It's got rockets on it.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.334
And we're in Florida.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.334
What the fuck do you think

01:24.418 --> 01:26.045
they're trying to hint at?

01:26.127 --> 01:28.463
Look, I can barely keep it

01:26.127 --> 01:28.463
together I'm so excited!

01:28.547 --> 01:32.133
Just so you know, if there's

01:28.547 --> 01:32.133
something I don't want to do,

01:28.547 --> 01:32.133
I'm not fucking doing it, okay?

01:32.217 --> 01:34.762
I've got enough cash

01:32.217 --> 01:34.762
to float me through

01:32.217 --> 01:34.762
this whole trip.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.764
I'm gonna have a good time

01:34.845 --> 01:36.764
and try to fucking relax.

01:36.847 --> 01:37.973
You see this thing?

01:38.057 --> 01:40.141
It's real.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.141
Got a bit of cash on me

01:40.225 --> 01:42.352
but if I run out,

01:40.225 --> 01:42.352
this is coming out.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.397
You know, I'm not gonna do

01:42.436 --> 01:45.397
a goddamn thing I don't

01:42.436 --> 01:45.397
want to do this trip

01:45.480 --> 01:48.650
and if Bubbles doesn't

01:45.480 --> 01:48.650
like it, he can go

01:45.480 --> 01:48.650
fuck himself.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.986
I don't really give

01:48.734 --> 01:50.986
a fuck either, Bubs,

01:48.734 --> 01:50.986
because there's a fuck

01:51.070 --> 01:53.488
of a lot more in this bag

01:51.070 --> 01:53.488
than just clothes.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.488
I don't know how the fuck

01:53.572 --> 01:55.574
it got across

01:53.572 --> 01:55.574
the border.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.574
(Laughs)

01:55.657 --> 01:56.909
For this trip,

01:55.657 --> 01:56.909
I'm fucking prepared.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.619
I'm not gonna

01:56.992 --> 01:58.619
starve this time.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.871
See these? Look like those

01:58.702 --> 02:00.871
little chocolatey kissy things?

02:00.955 --> 02:03.206
Well, they're not. Perfect way

02:00.955 --> 02:03.206
to get hash across the border.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.542
And I got two packs of hot dogs

02:03.290 --> 02:05.542
and brought a fucking knife.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.336
I'm basically ready for

02:05.626 --> 02:08.336
any fucking situation

02:05.626 --> 02:08.336
that comes at me.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.839
All right boys, this place

02:08.420 --> 02:10.839
looks pretty good.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.839
This looks nice, Bubs.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.758
Bubbles:

02:10.923 --> 02:12.758
Yeah, no kidding!

02:10.923 --> 02:12.758
Good job.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.384
Well, hopefully

02:12.841 --> 02:14.384
there's a fucking bar

02:12.841 --> 02:14.384
in this place.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.511
The Bubbler. The Bubbler

02:14.468 --> 02:16.511
pulled this one together.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.555
So what are

02:16.595 --> 02:18.555
we gonna do here?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.807
We just go in.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.643
How the... There's

02:21.224 --> 02:22.643
too many fucking...

02:22.726 --> 02:24.394
Ricky, just pull

02:22.726 --> 02:24.394
the fucking door...

02:24.478 --> 02:26.939
Bubbles:

02:24.478 --> 02:26.939
Ricky, pull the knob up.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.939
It's a normal unlocker.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.775
No, Ricky. Ricky! Ricky.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.401
In the front.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.401
See the unlocker?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.778
The other one,

02:31.485 --> 02:32.778
right there.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.029
Lift that up.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.029
Pull...

02:34.113 --> 02:35.280
Ye-es.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.782
There, now push

02:35.363 --> 02:36.782
that door out

02:36.865 --> 02:40.702
and there'll be

02:36.865 --> 02:40.702
a handle on this door.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.746
Holy fuck, Rick.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.623
Just pull on

02:42.830 --> 02:44.623
the fucking handle.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.792
It was a push handle,

02:44.706 --> 02:46.792
not a fucking puller!

02:46.875 --> 02:48.418
Julian:

02:46.875 --> 02:48.418
Push, pull, then try

02:46.875 --> 02:48.418
it both fucking ways!

02:48.502 --> 02:50.462
Fuck off, you stupid

02:48.502 --> 02:50.462
fucking thing!

02:52.673 --> 02:54.508
How many of you

02:52.673 --> 02:54.508
fucking guys is there?

02:54.591 --> 02:55.926
Better fucking

02:54.591 --> 02:55.926
stay out of my way.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.218
Hey, just wait,

02:56.010 --> 02:57.218
boys.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.639
What?

02:57.302 --> 03:00.639
Here, it says...

03:00.722 --> 03:03.182
"Meet Mayhue,

03:00.722 --> 03:03.182
room 420."

03:03.266 --> 03:05.102
420? Nice.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.102
All right, cool.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.102
Let's do it.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.520
All right, let's go

03:05.184 --> 03:06.520
meet this asshole

03:06.603 --> 03:08.147
and see what the fuck

03:06.603 --> 03:08.147
we gotta do.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.399
Look at this place.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.399
Hey, fellas.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.986
Here it is. Okay boys,

03:11.483 --> 03:13.986
cross your fingers.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.738
Your tasks await us.

03:16.822 --> 03:17.990
(Gentle knocking)

03:22.536 --> 03:24.788
Hey, dicklickers.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.788
Welcome to Florida.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.165
Jesus Murphy.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.415
Is that

03:26.247 --> 03:27.415
fucking real?

03:27.499 --> 03:28.959
Hey, eyes off the rig!

03:29.043 --> 03:31.252
Come on in.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.504
Bubbles:

03:31.336 --> 03:32.504
Fuck.

03:32.587 --> 03:33.755
Man:

03:32.587 --> 03:33.755
Say hello to the ladies.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.298
What were your names again?

03:35.382 --> 03:36.717
Julian:

03:35.382 --> 03:36.717
Hey, how's it going?

03:35.382 --> 03:36.717
Boys...

03:36.800 --> 03:38.802
Hey, ladies.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.802
(Crash)

03:38.886 --> 03:40.220
Ricky!

03:38.886 --> 03:40.220
Jesus Christ!

03:40.303 --> 03:42.514
Ricky...

03:40.303 --> 03:42.514
Hi, there.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.641
Julian:

03:42.597 --> 03:44.641
Okay, let's go

03:42.597 --> 03:44.641
with our room keys.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.309
Uh... what room keys?

03:46.393 --> 03:49.521
Swearnet thinks that we

03:46.393 --> 03:49.521
had our own rooms this time.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.232
Uhh, no.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.232
You get<i> a</i> room.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.483
You're looking

03:52.315 --> 03:53.483
at it.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.194
Bubs, what the fuck

03:53.567 --> 03:55.194
is he talking about?

03:55.276 --> 03:56.987
You said we had our

03:55.276 --> 03:56.987
own rooms this time out.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.987
Fuck.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.989
You guys didn't read

03:57.071 --> 03:58.989
the contracts again, did you?

03:59.073 --> 04:00.407
Yes, we did.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.407
I read it.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.407
Oh, Bubs.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.658
I read it

04:00.490 --> 04:01.658
very carefully.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.160
I got it right

04:01.742 --> 04:03.160
the fuck here.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.703
Right here.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.873
"The three of you will be

04:04.786 --> 04:07.873
staying in hotel<i> rooms</i>

04:07.956 --> 04:10.125
during the entire trip."

04:07.956 --> 04:10.125
<i>Rooms.</i>

04:10.209 --> 04:11.877
Correct.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.338
<i>A</i> room, multiple cities.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.549
Nice going, Bubs.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.549
Nice fucking going.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.300
Well, that's not

04:17.632 --> 04:19.300
the way it sounds

04:17.632 --> 04:19.300
when you read it.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.261
Oh, you fucked up

04:19.384 --> 04:21.261
again, didn't you?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.430
So we're supposed to

04:21.344 --> 04:23.430
stay in a fucking bed

04:21.344 --> 04:23.430
that you just banged in?

04:23.513 --> 04:24.890
Women: (Giggling)

04:23.513 --> 04:24.890
Man:

04:23.513 --> 04:24.890
Uh... not at all.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.474
You could sleep

04:24.973 --> 04:26.474
on the floor if

04:24.973 --> 04:26.474
you want to.

04:26.558 --> 04:27.976
Yeah.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.728
Awesome.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.728
Fuck's sakes!

04:29.811 --> 04:32.064
This is fucking great!

04:32.147 --> 04:34.315
Here's your tasks.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.568
I'm sorry... boys,

04:34.399 --> 04:36.568
This should be good.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.487
but that's not

04:36.651 --> 04:39.487
the way it sounds

04:36.651 --> 04:39.487
when you read it.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.489
Let me see here...

04:41.573 --> 04:44.618
O-o-h, boys!

04:44.701 --> 04:47.204
Get ready to be

04:44.701 --> 04:47.204
happy, boys!

04:47.287 --> 04:50.791
"Complete and pass

04:47.287 --> 04:50.791
NASA astronaut training."

04:50.874 --> 04:53.293
Ricky:

04:50.874 --> 04:53.293
(Scoffs)

04:50.874 --> 04:53.293
NASA astronaut training!

04:53.376 --> 04:56.296
Yeah, that'll be easy.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.296
"You can choo..." uh...

04:56.379 --> 04:59.591
Er, no, it

04:56.379 --> 04:59.591
says, um...

04:56.379 --> 04:59.591
What? Choose what?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.843
If we pass,

04:59.674 --> 05:01.843
we get to fly a...

05:01.927 --> 05:04.805
simulator mission in

05:01.927 --> 05:04.805
the space shuttle simulator

05:04.888 --> 05:07.515
with astronaut

05:04.888 --> 05:07.515
Chris Hadfield.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.852
Oh my God, and go

05:07.599 --> 05:10.852
to a real rocket launch.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.771
Holy fuck, are

05:10.936 --> 05:12.771
you kidding me?

05:10.936 --> 05:12.771
Julian: Who gives a fuck?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.397
This could

05:12.854 --> 05:14.397
really happen?

05:14.481 --> 05:17.192
Well, it depends.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.192
Do you guys have

05:14.481 --> 05:17.192
anything on you

05:17.276 --> 05:19.027
you're not

05:17.276 --> 05:19.027
supposed to have?

05:19.111 --> 05:20.821
I brought some clothes

06:35.770 --> 06:37.564
if we didn't do it with him,

06:37.647 --> 06:39.941
we'd be paying for it for

06:57.334 --> 06:59.294

06:57.334 --> 06:59.294

It's really coming

I've ever done.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.888
Zipping up and down there.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.557
I mean, I thought Ricky

11:20.972 --> 11:22.557
would suck at it

11:22.641 --> 11:25.018
but he was pretty good,

11:22.641 --> 11:25.018
probably because he was so high.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.853
But you need two hands for that,

with his drink... dangling.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.809
Don't cry, all right?

16:57.892 --> 16:59.727
Lifelong dream, gone.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.188
Do you promise we'll

16:59.811 --> 17:02.188
make a bunch more money?

17:02.271 --> 17:04.273
Yes. We're gonna make

17:02.271 --> 17:04.273
tons more money.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.734
Well, I'll fucking do it

17:04.357 --> 17:06.734
if he does, I guess, but...

17:06.818 --> 17:08.569
Ugh, come on. Don't

17:06.818 --> 17:08.569
leave this on me, man.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.404
Well, it's two to one now.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.866
This is like a team

17:10.488 --> 17:12.866
forming over here.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.283
Don't make him cry.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.283
Come on, Julian,

17:14.367 --> 17:17.328
it's a VIP launch

17:14.367 --> 17:17.328
and Chris Hadfield...

17:17.411 --> 17:19.246
in a simulator.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.246
That doesn't happen.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.290
And we're gonna make

17:19.330 --> 17:21.290
more money tomorrow?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.501
Yes.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.501
Do you promise?

17:23.584 --> 17:27.213
I guess... I do.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.213
No, no, no,

17:23.584 --> 17:27.213
do you promise?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.423
Yes.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.423
Okay.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.677
Let's do this stupid

17:30.800 --> 17:32.677
simulator thing.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.053
Where are we gonna

17:32.760 --> 17:34.053
meet this sexy prick?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.680
Let's...

17:35.763 --> 17:38.558
Let's just go

17:35.763 --> 17:38.558
cool down.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.809
Fuck, thanks,

17:38.641 --> 17:39.809
boys.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.478
You owe us, man.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.478
I know I owe us.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.647
Ricky:

17:43.145 --> 17:44.647
For five fucking grand,

17:43.145 --> 17:44.647
I'm gonna ask him

17:44.731 --> 17:46.482
to take my underwear weed

17:44.731 --> 17:46.482
up at the space station.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.943
Ricky, I swear to fuck,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.943
if you ask him that

17:46.566 --> 17:48.943
I will clock you.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.611
Yeah, go for it. Ask him.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.614
Do not ask a professional

17:50.695 --> 17:53.614
astronaut such a thing.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.617
There he is.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.911
Gentlemen.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.911
Hey, there.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.704
How are ya?

17:57.994 --> 17:59.704
How you doing?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.664
You guys ready for

17:59.787 --> 18:01.664
a space flight?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.664
I mean, I guess so.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.916
Oh, I've been ready

18:01.748 --> 18:02.916
my whole life.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.042
So, who's the commander?

18:04.124 --> 18:05.543
Commander Bubbles,

18:04.124 --> 18:05.543
right here.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.336
Commander, have we got

18:05.626 --> 18:07.336
a Mission Specialist?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.129
Mission Specialist One:

18:07.420 --> 18:09.129
Ricky.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.549
and...

18:09.213 --> 18:11.549
Mission Specialist

18:09.213 --> 18:11.549
Two: Julian.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.260
All right. And you read

18:11.632 --> 18:14.260
all the flight data file?

18:14.343 --> 18:15.595
You guys ready

18:14.343 --> 18:15.595
to fly this thing?

18:15.678 --> 18:17.346
Yes, sir.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.346
Hmm...

18:15.678 --> 18:17.346
Yes.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.140
I know it anyway, I've read

18:17.430 --> 18:20.140
them over and over again...

18:20.224 --> 18:21.601
All right.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.601
...a couple times.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.143
So let's... let's head

18:21.684 --> 18:23.143
up to the flight deck.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.854
All right.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.854
All right,

18:23.227 --> 18:24.854
follow me.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.856
Let's do it.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.856
A lot better-looking

18:24.938 --> 18:26.856
in real life.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.150
All right,

18:28.649 --> 18:30.150
so can you just,

18:30.234 --> 18:32.695
you know, walk me through

18:30.234 --> 18:32.695
a couple things here?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.572
Show me some of the

18:32.779 --> 18:34.572
main buttons and stuff?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.991
Oh, sure thing.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.991
Above your head you

18:34.655 --> 18:36.991
control all the computers.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.410
This is the whole reaction

18:37.075 --> 18:39.410
control system up here.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.538
All the really critical

18:39.493 --> 18:42.538
emergency stuff is in the

18:39.493 --> 18:42.538
middle here, Bubbles.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.373
All right.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.373
This is... you control

18:42.622 --> 18:44.373
flight controls,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.250
engines,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.250
we've got, uh,

18:46.333 --> 18:48.836
SRB sepa... solid rocket

18:46.333 --> 18:48.836
booster separation

18:46.333 --> 18:48.836
Yes.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.965
and external tank...

18:48.920 --> 18:51.965
you know that. ET separation.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.965
Yup.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.841
The puckaboo down here.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.841
You don't need to worry

18:52.048 --> 18:53.841
about the recorders,

18:53.925 --> 18:55.802
that's not critical.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.802
Communication's over here.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.095
Are you good?

18:55.885 --> 18:57.095
I'm good.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.388
Okay.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.388
MS1 is good.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.890
Good work, Ricky.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.516
Nice job.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.516
Okay, so maybe,

19:02.600 --> 19:05.227
we can walk through a launch

19:02.600 --> 19:05.227
here a little bit, can we?

19:05.311 --> 19:07.313
Woman: (over headsets)

19:05.311 --> 19:07.313
<i>All right, why don't we</i>

19:05.311 --> 19:07.313
<i>start up the main engines?</i>

19:07.396 --> 19:09.607
Yes. Main engines.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.651
Right here.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.651
Woman:<i> Yeah.</i>

19:11.734 --> 19:14.445
One, two, three.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.445
All three

19:11.734 --> 19:14.445
lights are on.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.156
Woman:<i> All right, main engine</i>

19:14.528 --> 19:17.156
<i>start-up is successful.</i>

19:17.239 --> 19:19.075
I can feel the

19:17.239 --> 19:19.075
power building.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.327
Woman:

19:19.158 --> 19:21.327
<i>10, 9, 8, 7...</i>

19:21.410 --> 19:24.455
Fucking go...

19:21.410 --> 19:24.455
<i>6, 5, 4,</i>

19:24.538 --> 19:28.208
<i>3, 2, 1.</i>

19:28.292 --> 19:30.503
<i>Booster ignition,</i>

19:28.292 --> 19:30.503
<i>and lift-off.</i>

19:30.586 --> 19:31.754
Hadfield:

19:30.586 --> 19:31.754
All right.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.172
Bubbles:

19:31.838 --> 19:33.172
Here we go, boys.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.882
Hadfield:

19:33.255 --> 19:34.882
Just watch your machs build,

19:34.966 --> 19:36.592
altitude's building.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.592
You see the roll program?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.011
Yeah, I see it.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.011
You gotta call Houston,

19:38.094 --> 19:39.345
say, "Roll program,

19:38.094 --> 19:39.345
Houston."

19:39.428 --> 19:41.097
Roll program, Houston.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.307
Woman:<i> All right.</i>

19:41.180 --> 19:43.307
It's coming well.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.307
It rolled nicely.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.225
We're lined up,

19:43.390 --> 19:45.225
we're headed for

19:43.390 --> 19:45.225
the space station.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.478
You can see our heading,

19:45.309 --> 19:47.478
we've got it all

19:45.309 --> 19:47.478
right underneath us.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.897
Look at our speed.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.897
Look how fast we're going.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.108
We're already

19:49.981 --> 19:52.108
going 500 knots.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.108
Jesus Murphy!

19:52.191 --> 19:54.360
Woman:

19:52.191 --> 19:54.360
<i>Go ahead, uh, throttle</i>

19:52.191 --> 19:54.360
<i>down to</i> (indistinct).

19:54.443 --> 19:56.195
We just went

19:54.443 --> 19:56.195
through Mach 1,

19:56.278 --> 19:58.114
we're faster than

19:56.278 --> 19:58.114
the speed of

19:56.278 --> 19:58.114
sound, gentlemen.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.449
Awesome.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.449
This is awesome.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.449
(Nervous giggling)

20:00.533 --> 20:02.451
You know what

20:00.533 --> 20:02.451
this means?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.451
We're in space?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.328
We're in space.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.328
Woman:

20:02.535 --> 20:04.328
<i>Welcome to orbit.</i>

20:04.411 --> 20:05.621
Hadfield:

20:04.411 --> 20:05.621
We're in orbit, guys!

20:05.705 --> 20:06.914
Bubbles:

20:05.705 --> 20:06.914
We're in orbit, boys.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.833
All right.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.833
Good job.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.833
Yes! Good job.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.793
Do you like high fives?

20:08.916 --> 20:10.793
Absolutely.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.793
There you go, sir.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.086
Nice job.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.213
MS1 is gonna turn on

20:12.170 --> 20:14.213
some lights here.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.049
Bubbles:

20:14.296 --> 20:16.049
Ricky. Ricky! Ricky!

20:16.132 --> 20:19.426
You don't just throw

20:16.132 --> 20:19.426
switches in the shuttle.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.426
You'll blow us up.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.554
I don't know what the fuck

20:19.510 --> 20:21.554
is wrong with Ricky.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.681
Everything's going great,

20:21.637 --> 20:23.681
the take-off was perfect,

20:23.764 --> 20:26.726
and then, of course,

20:23.764 --> 20:26.726
he has to start fucking around!

20:26.809 --> 20:28.769
Ricky:

20:26.809 --> 20:28.769
MS1 is hungry.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.769
Ah!

20:28.853 --> 20:30.980
Ricky, you can't

20:28.853 --> 20:30.980
get hungry right now.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.356
Is it cool to

20:31.064 --> 20:32.356
smoke in here?

20:32.439 --> 20:34.817
Ricky, we're in the

20:32.439 --> 20:34.817
middle of a launch!

20:34.901 --> 20:37.319
All right, would you like

20:34.901 --> 20:37.319
to deploy satellite?

20:37.403 --> 20:40.031
Yes, satellite deploy, please.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.201
Control, we are beginning

20:40.114 --> 20:43.201
target tracking procedure.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.369
Ricky...

20:43.283 --> 20:45.369
That's a good

20:43.283 --> 20:45.369
mission specialist.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.705
That's not... You're on

20:45.452 --> 20:47.705
a different page, Ricky.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.624
Woman:

20:47.788 --> 20:50.624
<i>Type in Spec 2-0-2-1.</i>

20:50.708 --> 20:52.668
Bubbles:

20:50.708 --> 20:52.668
Spec...

20:50.708 --> 20:52.668
No, no, no.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.378
Let's just... let's just

20:52.752 --> 20:54.378
hit clear there.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.005
Ricky:

20:54.461 --> 20:56.005
Bubbles, what are you doing?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.590
Here's spec.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.590
That was terrible.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.299
Spec...

20:57.673 --> 20:59.299
Ready to close the

20:57.673 --> 20:59.299
payload bay doors.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.011
Execute.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.011
Watch. Payload bay

20:59.383 --> 21:02.011
doors are closing.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.846
Watch, you'll swing them

21:02.095 --> 21:03.846
down here in a second.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.472
Ricky: Wicked.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.472
Here they come.

21:05.556 --> 21:06.724
Bubbles:

21:05.556 --> 21:06.724
There's the doors, boys.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.975
Closed up.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.975
Yep, they're closing.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.268
The doors...

21:08.059 --> 21:09.268
Yep, thanks to me.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.519
Hadfield:

21:09.351 --> 21:10.519
Centre latches.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.354
Bubbles:

21:10.603 --> 21:12.354
Thanks to me. I executed.

21:12.438 --> 21:13.689
You haven't really

21:12.438 --> 21:13.689
done much, Bubs.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.399
You... he's punching

21:13.773 --> 21:15.399
everything in.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.235
Bubbles:

21:15.482 --> 21:17.235
I am executing

21:15.482 --> 21:17.235
every command, Ricky.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.153
Ah, that's true.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.572
Woman:

21:19.237 --> 21:21.572
<i>All right, you guys ready</i>

21:19.237 --> 21:21.572
<i>to bring it back home?</i>

21:21.655 --> 21:24.742
Yes, ma'am.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.742
Let's bring it home. Re-entry.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.160
Woman:

21:24.825 --> 21:26.160
<i>All right.</i>

21:26.244 --> 21:28.788
Hadfield:

21:26.244 --> 21:28.788
Coming down 25,000 feet now.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.248
We are descending

21:28.871 --> 21:30.248
rapidly.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.832
And we're

21:30.330 --> 21:31.832
picking up speed.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.333
Look, there's Florida.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.333
You see it over here?

21:33.417 --> 21:34.710
You got Florida coming

21:33.417 --> 21:34.710
around. You got it?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.670
Ricky: Oh, nice.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.670
Bubbles:

21:34.794 --> 21:36.670
Okay, yes sir.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.547
Okay, that's Banana Creek.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.547
We don't want to go in there.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.340
Bubbles: Banana Creek?

21:38.631 --> 21:40.340
Hadfield:

21:38.631 --> 21:40.340
Yep, coming around.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.842
Hadfield: Pretty soon

21:40.424 --> 21:41.842
you'll see the runway.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.636
Yeah.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.636
Looking good.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.596
Keep chasing her.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.596
Yeah, I got it.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.681
Good, you're

21:45.679 --> 21:47.681
hanging in there.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.681
Chasing it.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.142
You're not gonna go through

21:47.765 --> 21:49.142
that cloud, are you?

21:49.225 --> 21:50.893
Err... no.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.893
Okay, good. All right.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.645
Now we're lining up.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.645
Do you see the runway?

21:52.728 --> 21:54.939
Yes, I see it

21:52.728 --> 21:54.939
right there.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.939
Okay, good deal. Line up.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.233
Aim for the doghouse

21:55.022 --> 21:57.233
at the bottom there.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.943
Woman:

21:57.316 --> 21:58.943
<i>All right commander, I'm</i>

21:57.316 --> 21:58.943
<i>going to give you control.</i>

21:59.026 --> 22:00.611
<i>Are you ready?</i>

21:59.026 --> 22:00.611
I am ready.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.488
Woman:

22:00.694 --> 22:02.488
<i>All right, here we go.</i>

22:02.571 --> 22:04.115
Okay, boys.

22:04.198 --> 22:05.365
That's good.

22:04.198 --> 22:05.365
Right about there.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.867
Hold her about there.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.286
Okay.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.286
You're doing all right.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.620
Okay, a little right,

22:08.368 --> 22:09.620
just a hair right.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.038
Just...

22:09.703 --> 22:11.038
a little right.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.038
Okay.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.957
Right... okay,

22:11.122 --> 22:12.957
right about there.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.792
Oh, hold on

22:13.040 --> 22:14.792
there, boys.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.792
Okay, we're coming through...

22:14.875 --> 22:16.085
What are you doing?

22:14.875 --> 22:16.085
Ricky, just leave me alone.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.004
I got it.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.004
I can land this thing.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.922
Okay, that's a little high.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.922
Woman:

22:18.087 --> 22:19.922
<i>All right, the gear is down.</i>

22:20.006 --> 22:21.590
Okay, the gear is down.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.590
Bubbles:

22:20.006 --> 22:21.590
Gear's down, boys.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.217
Okay, uh, flare.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.217
Bring... bring the nose up.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.219
Bring the nose up.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.679
What are you doing?

22:25.303 --> 22:26.679
Hadfield:

22:25.303 --> 22:26.679
Up, up, up, up...

22:26.762 --> 22:28.014
I got her, boys. I got her.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.389
Hadfield:

22:28.097 --> 22:29.389
...up a lot more.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.389
Ricky: Ahh!

22:29.473 --> 22:31.349
Bubbles:

22:29.473 --> 22:31.349
I got her, boys.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.349
Hadfield: Whoa!

22:31.433 --> 22:32.768
Let her down now.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.768
You're doing okay.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.145
Down now.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.145
Bubbles:

22:32.852 --> 22:34.145
I got her, boys.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.855
This is so embarrassing.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.855
It's ridiculous.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.439
Bubbles:

22:35.938 --> 22:37.439
I got her.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.439
Hadfield: That's good.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.899
Bubbles:

22:37.523 --> 22:38.899
Everybody relax.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.899
We're doing okay.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.193
Ricky: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

22:38.983 --> 22:40.193
Bubbles:

22:38.983 --> 22:40.193
Everybody relax.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.610
Okay, a little flare.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.610
A little flare.

22:41.694 --> 22:42.987
Ricky:

22:41.694 --> 22:42.987
Flare.

22:41.694 --> 22:42.987
Julian: Flare, man.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.280
Bubbles:

22:43.070 --> 22:44.280
Flare. Flare. Flare.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.572
Hadfield:

22:44.362 --> 22:45.572
Okay, now, now, now, now down.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.866
Ricky:

22:45.656 --> 22:46.866
Nose down. Nose down. Nose down.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.534
Bubbles:

22:46.949 --> 22:48.534
I got her, boys. Everyone relax.

22:48.617 --> 22:49.952
Okay, we're down

22:48.617 --> 22:49.952
to a hundred...

22:50.036 --> 22:51.871
Left. Left.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.871
Ricky:

22:50.036 --> 22:51.871
Left, Bubs, left!

22:51.954 --> 22:53.706
Julian:

22:51.954 --> 22:53.706
...fully out of control, boys.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.373
Hadfield:

22:53.789 --> 22:55.373
Okay, it... okay.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.373
Bubbles: ...under control.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.750
Hadfield:

22:55.457 --> 22:56.750
That's a pretty

22:55.457 --> 22:56.750
good bounce. Okay.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.544
Get her back over.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.544
<i>Parachute has deployed.</i>

22:58.627 --> 23:00.004
Okay, chute...

23:00.087 --> 23:02.048
Okay, we want to get

23:00.087 --> 23:02.048
onto the centre line,

23:02.131 --> 23:04.091
because everyone's

23:02.131 --> 23:04.091
going to take our pictures.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.091
Bubbles: Okay.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.634
Okay, line her up with

23:04.175 --> 23:05.634
the centre line there.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.385
Bubbles:

23:05.718 --> 23:07.385
I'm trying to get her... over.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.055
Hadfield:

23:07.469 --> 23:09.055
Okay, jettison the

23:07.469 --> 23:09.055
chute, 50 knots.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.556
Bubbles:

23:09.138 --> 23:10.556
Jettison the chute.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.556
There's the centre line.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.975
Look at that.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.975
Bubbles:

23:10.639 --> 23:12.975
Coming into play.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.353
Ricky:

23:13.059 --> 23:15.353
It was a good recovery,

23:13.059 --> 23:15.353
but a terrible fucking landing.

23:15.435 --> 23:18.272
Bubbles:

23:15.435 --> 23:18.272
Ricky, are you kidding me?

23:15.435 --> 23:18.272
Julian: Horrible.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.482
Uh... Uh, well, uh,

23:18.356 --> 23:20.482
it may be a landing

23:18.356 --> 23:20.482
we can walk away from.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.442
Bubbles:

23:20.566 --> 23:22.442
We are...

23:20.566 --> 23:22.442
Ricky: All right.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.694
Julian:

23:22.526 --> 23:23.694
Yeah, that's true.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.694
Woman:<i> Welcome home.</i>

23:23.777 --> 23:24.945
Wheels stopped, Houston.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.948
Commander Bubbles

23:25.029 --> 23:27.948
brought her in safe.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.575
Holy fuck, did you

23:28.032 --> 23:29.575
see that, boys?

23:29.658 --> 23:31.285
I just landed

23:29.658 --> 23:31.285
the space shuttle.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.870
Ricky: Yeah.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.870
Julian:

23:31.369 --> 23:32.870
That was pretty cool, Bubs.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.454
I just... That was

23:32.953 --> 23:34.454
unbelievable, wasn't it?

23:34.538 --> 23:36.332
Yeah, that was unbelievable.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.791
(Excited laugh)

23:37.875 --> 23:40.460
Chris Hadfield said

23:37.875 --> 23:40.460
I'm an unbelievable pilot.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.089
I've been training to be

23:40.544 --> 23:43.089
an astronaut my whole life,

23:43.172 --> 23:45.925
so to have somebody like

23:43.172 --> 23:45.925
Commander Chris Hadfield

23:46.008 --> 23:48.719
tell me that I got

23:46.008 --> 23:48.719
the right stuff,

23:48.802 --> 23:50.679
that's just music to my ears.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.015
I'm basically...

23:50.763 --> 23:53.015
like Chuck Yeager.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.310
Now, just watch your

23:53.099 --> 23:56.310
head there. These shuttle

23:53.099 --> 23:56.310
doors aren't that big.

23:56.394 --> 23:58.104
I got her.

23:56.394 --> 23:58.104
I'm good, thanks.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.022
I guess you know that.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.022
I guess you that, anyway.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.524
(Laughs)

24:00.106 --> 24:02.524
Holy fuck, boys!

24:02.608 --> 24:04.860
You saw it.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.860
You just witnessed it.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.860
Nice job. Yep.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.404
You just

24:04.944 --> 24:06.404
witnessed it.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.404
Yeah, it was something else.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.989
Safely back on Earth.

24:09.073 --> 24:12.368
Oh my God,

24:09.073 --> 24:12.368
I got very excited.

24:09.073 --> 24:12.368
I gotta use it.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.911
Don't go anywhere,

24:12.450 --> 24:13.911
don't leave.

24:13.994 --> 24:17.748
I'll be back, but

24:13.994 --> 24:17.748
I gotta use it bad.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.666
Wow.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.129
So, uh...

24:19.750 --> 24:23.129
I... I gotta go

24:19.750 --> 24:23.129
catch a flight,

24:23.212 --> 24:25.505
but that was not

24:23.212 --> 24:25.505
the best landing...

24:25.589 --> 24:27.133
uh... I have

24:25.589 --> 24:27.133
ever seen.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.133
No kidding.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.135
We thought so.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.135
And these,

24:27.216 --> 24:29.135
there's not...

24:29.218 --> 24:32.054
not too many of

24:29.218 --> 24:32.054
these. So, uh...

24:32.138 --> 24:34.723
I don't know to, uh...

24:32.138 --> 24:34.723
let him down, but...

24:34.807 --> 24:36.434
We'll do it.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.060
If you do it, you'll probably

24:36.516 --> 24:38.060
break his heart, so...

24:38.144 --> 24:39.395
We'll do it.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.395
Well, you know, his...

24:39.477 --> 24:40.896
his glasses are

24:39.477 --> 24:40.896
a little thick.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.522
He can't see a thing.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.522
Nah.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.276
And he seems a little

24:42.606 --> 24:45.276
excitable, you know?

24:45.359 --> 24:46.777
Julian:

24:45.359 --> 24:46.777
Yeah.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.777
Ricky: Slightly.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.695
He might not, uh...

24:46.860 --> 24:48.695
be cut out for it.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.364
No. Absolutely not.

24:50.448 --> 24:51.698
Okay, we'll talk to him.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.117
All right.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.117
I appreciate that.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.077
No problem. Well, it was

24:53.200 --> 24:55.077
good meeting you, man.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.495
Well, it was nice to safely

24:55.161 --> 24:57.495
get back to Earth with you.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.872
Yeah.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.872
He's got to go, Bubs.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.249
He's got to go.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.249
Oh, you got to go?

25:00.333 --> 25:01.875
I've got to go.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.875
I... I was glad

25:01.959 --> 25:03.669
to be able to get back

25:01.959 --> 25:03.669
to Earth with you.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.297
Oh, thank you. Thank you,

25:03.752 --> 25:06.297
so I'm gonna go, you know,

25:06.380 --> 25:08.506
talk to some people

25:06.380 --> 25:08.506
and maybe if you see

25:06.380 --> 25:08.506
my name there

25:08.590 --> 25:10.843
on the list say,

25:08.590 --> 25:10.843
"Hey, I flew with him.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.843
Bump him to the top."

25:10.926 --> 25:12.219
Julian:

25:10.926 --> 25:12.219
We already talked

25:10.926 --> 25:12.219
about that, Bubs.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.054
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.054
Bump him to the top.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.389
Julian:

25:14.138 --> 25:15.389
You're good Bubs.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.389
It's been sorted.

25:15.473 --> 25:16.807
All right.

25:15.473 --> 25:16.807
All right, well,

25:15.473 --> 25:16.807
thanks again.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.268
Congratulations.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.268
Thank you very much.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.187
Take care.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.187
See you.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.730
See you again, I might

25:21.270 --> 25:23.730
try to come to Mars when

25:21.270 --> 25:23.730
they're ready for that.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.649
Shoot for the stars,

25:23.814 --> 25:25.649
they say. And that's

25:23.814 --> 25:25.649
what I'm doing.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.067
Okay, let's hit the bar.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.067
Always follow

25:25.732 --> 25:27.067
your dreams,

25:27.151 --> 25:28.902
that's what

25:27.151 --> 25:28.902
they always say.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.863
I know that's

25:28.986 --> 25:30.863
what they say, okay.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.863
Let's go get a few drinks.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.239
Come on.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.239
Right, follow

25:30.946 --> 25:32.239
your dreams.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.866
Follow me.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.866
We've got to

25:32.323 --> 25:33.866
have a little talk.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.451
Never give up.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.451
I've heard that before.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.744
We gotta have

25:35.533 --> 25:37.744
a little talk, Bubs.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.744
Yeah, all right.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.246
Fuck, boys, I'm losing

25:37.828 --> 25:39.246
my mind here.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.706
I don't think I can

25:39.330 --> 25:40.706
keep it together.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.792
We are on our way

25:40.789 --> 25:43.792
to a rocket launch.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.212
A rocket launch!

25:46.295 --> 25:48.922
And I'm gonna be in

25:46.295 --> 25:48.922
one of those one day.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.509
Bubs, did you ever hear

25:49.006 --> 25:51.509
the saying, "Don't

25:49.006 --> 25:51.509
get your hopes up?"

25:51.591 --> 25:53.802
Yes.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.802
Well, that's what you're

25:51.591 --> 25:53.802
doing right now, okay?

25:53.886 --> 25:55.762
No, I'm not, Julian.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.762
There's a difference

25:55.846 --> 25:58.807
between just

25:55.846 --> 25:58.807
getting your hopes

25:55.846 --> 25:58.807
up for no reason,

25:58.891 --> 26:01.559
and getting your

25:58.891 --> 26:01.559
hopes up because

25:58.891 --> 26:01.559
a real astronaut

26:01.643 --> 26:03.979
basically just told

26:01.643 --> 26:03.979
you, you're gonna

26:01.643 --> 26:03.979
become one, one day.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.647
But all I'm saying

26:04.063 --> 26:05.647
is you shouldn't

26:04.063 --> 26:05.647
get too excited

26:05.731 --> 26:07.233
until you get

26:05.731 --> 26:07.233
a call back, okay?

26:07.316 --> 26:09.276
Okay.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.276
Whatever you say.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.611
I'm just gonna

26:09.360 --> 26:11.611
say something...

26:09.360 --> 26:11.611
T-minus 00:44:38...

26:11.695 --> 26:13.113
and, you know, don't

26:11.695 --> 26:13.113
take it the wrong way.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.615
Don't let it

26:13.197 --> 26:15.615
hurt you, but...

26:13.197 --> 26:15.615
00:44:37...

26:15.699 --> 26:18.452
you are ever,

26:15.699 --> 26:18.452
never, ever...

26:15.699 --> 26:18.452
Rick... Ricky.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.620
going to...

26:18.536 --> 26:20.620
Rick. Rick.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.620
That's enough.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.164
Can't hear you,

26:20.704 --> 26:22.164
Ricky.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.750
Can't hear you,

26:22.248 --> 26:24.750
too focused.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.877
00:44:32...

26:24.833 --> 26:26.877
Bub, is this...

26:26.960 --> 26:29.629
is this 45 minute

26:26.960 --> 26:29.629
countdown necessary?

26:26.960 --> 26:29.629
Seriously?

26:29.713 --> 26:32.799
I like to be synced up

26:29.713 --> 26:32.799
'cause I know what

26:29.713 --> 26:32.799
they're doing now.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.177
They're almost

26:32.883 --> 26:35.177
at T-minus 43.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.304
They're gonna be

26:35.261 --> 26:37.304
stirring the tanks.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.765
Stirring the fucking tanks,

26:37.388 --> 26:39.765
we're gonna miss that.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.808
That sucks,

26:39.848 --> 26:41.808
but whatever.

26:41.892 --> 26:44.895
We have VIP

26:41.892 --> 26:44.895
passes... boys.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.147
So those fucking

26:44.978 --> 26:47.147
passes, we can go

26:44.978 --> 26:47.147
wherever we want, right?

26:47.231 --> 26:48.982
That's what

26:47.231 --> 26:48.982
a VIP is, Ricky.

26:49.066 --> 26:53.112
I'm hoping... we can

26:49.066 --> 26:53.112
get right up to the

26:49.066 --> 26:53.112
fucking room there

26:53.195 --> 26:54.363
where they push

26:53.195 --> 26:54.363
the launch button.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.574
Maybe they'll

26:54.447 --> 26:56.574
let me push it.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.617
What's it made out of?

26:57.241 --> 26:59.617
Like, would duct tape

26:57.241 --> 26:59.617
stick to at least?

26:59.701 --> 27:02.079
Okay, boys, T-minus...

26:59.701 --> 27:02.079
Here we go.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.330
Duct tape sticks.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.330
It sticks to everything.

27:03.414 --> 27:04.998
Duct tape?

27:03.414 --> 27:04.998
Okay.

27:03.414 --> 27:04.998
Yes.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.042
Okay, boys.

27:07.126 --> 27:10.045
They're running

27:07.126 --> 27:10.045
system checks right

27:07.126 --> 27:10.045
now, I guarantee you.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.214
Can you pull over?

27:10.129 --> 27:12.214
I gotta take a piss.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.882
Ricky!

27:12.298 --> 27:13.882
What?

27:13.966 --> 27:16.927
We're not pulling over.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.927
We got no fucking time.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.762
I'm gonna miss

27:17.010 --> 27:18.762
the fucking...

27:18.845 --> 27:20.431
Well, I've probably got

27:18.845 --> 27:20.431
to piss or something.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.099
Ricky, there could

27:20.514 --> 27:22.099
be a problem.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.560
They might need a

27:22.182 --> 27:24.560
second set of eyes

27:22.182 --> 27:24.560
on things out there.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.686
You know what?

27:24.642 --> 27:26.686
It's fine. I'll meet

27:24.642 --> 27:26.686
you guys there, okay?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.397
Ricky...

27:26.770 --> 27:28.397
I don't want

27:26.770 --> 27:28.397
you to miss it.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.232
You know what?

27:28.481 --> 27:30.232
I don't give a

27:28.481 --> 27:30.232
fuck! Get out!

27:30.316 --> 27:32.276
Okay.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.276
Meet us there.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.737
I'll see you there.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.737
I am not missing this

27:32.359 --> 27:35.737
for your piss, Ricky.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.991
Not a chance.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.991
Okay, Julian.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.826
Look at him.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.826
Where is he going?

27:40.909 --> 27:42.453
Who gives a fuck?

27:40.909 --> 27:42.453
He'll meet us there.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.789
Bubbles:

27:43.787 --> 27:45.789
Listen. All steps are complete.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.958
5 minutes 25,

27:45.872 --> 27:47.958
5 minutes 24...

27:48.041 --> 27:49.667
Julian:

27:48.041 --> 27:49.667
Bubs, do you really think

27:48.041 --> 27:49.667
the 45 minute countdown

27:49.751 --> 27:51.462
was necessary for

27:49.751 --> 27:51.462
this fucking thing?

27:51.545 --> 27:52.838
5 minutes 23...

27:51.545 --> 27:52.838
Julian:

27:51.545 --> 27:52.838
You're driving me fucking nuts.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.840
Bubbles:

27:52.921 --> 27:54.840
5 minutes 22, 5 minutes 21...

27:54.923 --> 27:56.592
Where's Ricky at?

27:54.923 --> 27:56.592
He's gonna miss

27:54.923 --> 27:56.592
this stupid thing.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.676
5 minutes 20,

27:56.674 --> 27:58.676
5 minutes 19...

27:58.760 --> 28:00.720
Man: (On loudspeaker)

27:58.760 --> 28:00.720
<i>The launch time</i>

27:58.760 --> 28:00.720
<i>is five minutes...</i>

28:00.804 --> 28:03.015
Five minutes, right!

28:00.804 --> 28:03.015
(Indistinct chatter

28:00.804 --> 28:03.015
on loudspeaker)

28:03.098 --> 28:05.643
One minute away

28:03.098 --> 28:05.643
from the four

28:03.098 --> 28:05.643
minute hold, boys.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.893
Julian:

28:05.725 --> 28:06.893
Ricky!

28:06.977 --> 28:08.270
Holy fuck, boys.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.105
Oh, thank fuck.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.105
I didn't miss it.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.482
Miss it? How could

28:10.189 --> 28:11.482
you miss it?

28:11.565 --> 28:13.150
You would have saw

28:11.565 --> 28:13.150
the fucking thing.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.985
Holy Christ, I had to

28:13.233 --> 28:14.985
go all the way around,

28:15.068 --> 28:16.362
because of the

28:15.068 --> 28:16.362
fucking water.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.280
All the way

28:16.445 --> 28:18.280
around to where?

28:18.364 --> 28:19.739
To the fucking...

28:18.364 --> 28:19.739
the firework.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.783
You said we could go

28:19.823 --> 28:21.783
wherever we wanted, so...

28:21.867 --> 28:23.410
What?

28:21.867 --> 28:23.410
Let's just say, boys,

28:21.867 --> 28:23.410
we are set up.

28:23.494 --> 28:24.828
If we ever have

28:23.494 --> 28:24.828
to go to space,

28:24.911 --> 28:27.080
we are taken care

28:24.911 --> 28:27.080
of in every way

28:24.911 --> 28:27.080
possible.

28:27.164 --> 28:28.706
Ricky, tell me you

28:27.164 --> 28:28.706
did not just

28:28.790 --> 28:30.501
fucking duct tape

28:28.790 --> 28:30.501
something to that rocket.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.794
Yeah, onto one of

28:30.584 --> 28:32.794
the finny things.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.796
This is like one of the

28:32.878 --> 28:34.796
best days of my life, boys.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.590
I'm gonna be like one of

28:34.880 --> 28:36.590
the people that, you know,

28:36.674 --> 28:38.384
have one of those

28:36.674 --> 28:38.384
first things.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.093
Like fucking

28:38.467 --> 28:40.093
Neil Eggstrong,

28:40.177 --> 28:42.262
first guy ever

28:40.177 --> 28:42.262
to send it up, man.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.807
Tell you one thing,

28:43.805 --> 28:45.807
it's a lot fucking bigger

28:43.805 --> 28:45.807
when you get up close.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.809
It doesn't look

28:45.891 --> 28:47.809
that big from here.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.809
It's fucking huge.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.520
Those little finny things

28:47.893 --> 28:49.520
are bigger than me.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.980
Ricky doesn't

28:49.603 --> 28:51.980
understand basic shapes,

28:52.064 --> 28:54.316
let alone anything to do

28:52.064 --> 28:54.316
with fucking rocket science.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.277
He doesn't understand

28:54.400 --> 28:57.277
you tape one thing to the fin

28:57.361 --> 28:59.363
and you've changed

28:57.361 --> 28:59.363
the whole fucking trajectory.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.157
Zing zing, off she goes.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.034
Kablamo!

29:04.117 --> 29:08.414
Crowd:

29:04.117 --> 29:08.414
Five, four, three, two, one...

29:10.624 --> 29:12.084
Ricky:

29:10.624 --> 29:12.084
Holy shit!

29:12.167 --> 29:14.670
(Indistinct chatter

29:12.167 --> 29:14.670
on loudspeaker)

29:14.753 --> 29:17.548
(Rocket engine

29:14.753 --> 29:17.548
crackling, rumbling)

29:17.631 --> 29:19.633
Julian:

29:17.631 --> 29:19.633
Oh, that is pretty cool, Bubs.

29:19.717 --> 29:22.595
Ricky:

29:19.717 --> 29:22.595
It's a lot bigger

29:19.717 --> 29:22.595
than a firework.

29:22.678 --> 29:23.845
Look at that.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.391
Nice.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.391
You okay, buddy?

29:27.474 --> 29:28.684
Okay, man?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.728
You know what?

29:30.810 --> 29:32.479
It's a lot cooler

29:30.810 --> 29:32.479
than I thought it was.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.648
(Choked up,

29:32.563 --> 29:34.648
indistinct comment)

29:34.732 --> 29:36.442
Listen to the heat.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.901
She's bringing the heat.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.697
I hope that fire doesn't

29:39.445 --> 29:41.697
burn my package up.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.283
(Engine rumbling)

29:44.366 --> 29:47.953
Ho-ly fuck!

29:48.036 --> 29:50.372
Decent!

29:50.456 --> 29:51.624
(Rumbling, crackling)

29:51.707 --> 29:54.334
Kinda sounds like

29:51.707 --> 29:54.334
popcorn a little bit.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.462
Ricky:

29:54.418 --> 29:56.462
Why is it going on a curve?

29:56.545 --> 29:58.631
Julian:

29:56.545 --> 29:58.631
Don't tell me you

29:56.545 --> 29:58.631
fucked up the rocket, Rick?

29:58.714 --> 30:01.634
Bubbles:

29:58.714 --> 30:01.634
No, no, that's the right

29:58.714 --> 30:01.634
trajectory, right there, boys.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.636
She's going right

30:01.717 --> 30:03.636
where she needs to.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.304
(Continued chatter

30:03.719 --> 30:05.304
on loudspeaker)

30:05.387 --> 30:07.055
So if we do

30:05.387 --> 30:07.055
go to Mars,

30:07.139 --> 30:09.475
we have to stop

30:07.139 --> 30:09.475
at that asteroid and

30:07.139 --> 30:09.475
pick up my weed, right?

30:09.558 --> 30:11.017
Ricky, we're not

30:09.558 --> 30:11.017
going to fucking Mars.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.106
Bubbles:

30:13.937 --> 30:16.106
It's going to space!

30:16.189 --> 30:18.317
That's gonna be

30:16.189 --> 30:18.317
me someday, boys.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.277
Chris Hadfield

30:18.400 --> 30:20.277
basically said it.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.861
Well, Bubs...

30:21.945 --> 30:23.656
I don't think

30:21.945 --> 30:23.656
he really said that.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.701
All right, let's go

30:25.532 --> 30:27.701
get drunk and look

30:25.532 --> 30:27.701
at some ladies, man.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.869
Let's go, come on.

30:29.953 --> 30:32.414
Are you coming?

30:29.953 --> 30:32.414
Bubs, come on.

30:29.953 --> 30:32.414
It's over.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.250
Man: (On loudspeaker)

30:32.498 --> 30:35.250
<i>...101 miles...</i>

30:32.498 --> 30:35.250
Bubbles: Decent.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.462
Julian:

30:36.876 --> 30:38.462
The only way I'd let you guys

30:38.545 --> 30:40.922
bang a bunch of seniors

30:38.545 --> 30:40.922
is if you were

30:38.545 --> 30:40.922
seniors yourselves.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.633
You're lucky I was there.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.633
They weren't seniors.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.217
They were seniors, man.

30:44.301 --> 30:47.346
Those two would have

30:44.301 --> 30:47.346
fucking tore you to pieces.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.222
Yeah, with any luck

30:47.429 --> 30:49.222
they would have torn

30:47.429 --> 30:49.222
me to pieces.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.641
Boys, do we have a key?

30:50.724 --> 30:53.059
I don't have a key.

30:53.143 --> 30:56.062
I'll go to the desk.

30:53.143 --> 30:56.062
What is it?

30:56.146 --> 30:58.106
Oh, don't tell me

30:56.146 --> 30:58.106
you're still here.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.026
Just so you know, man,

30:58.190 --> 31:01.026
we're not gonna be slave

31:01.109 --> 31:02.861
to your bullshit

31:01.109 --> 31:02.861
this fucking time.

31:02.944 --> 31:06.323
I don't give two fucks what

31:02.944 --> 31:06.323
you morons fucking end up doing.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.909
Here's your plane tickets and

31:06.406 --> 31:09.909
all the shit you're gonna need.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.662
You're not coming?

31:11.745 --> 31:14.832
No, I'm gonna stay

31:11.745 --> 31:14.832
here with my new

31:11.745 --> 31:14.832
friends from Florida.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.542
How the fuck are

31:14.914 --> 31:16.542
we supposed to

31:14.914 --> 31:16.542
make any money?

31:16.625 --> 31:18.293
Oh, you'll still make money.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.587
Just do the tasks you're

31:18.377 --> 31:20.587
supposed to do in each city.

31:20.671 --> 31:23.923
They don't pay me enough

31:20.671 --> 31:23.923
to hang around and fucking

31:20.671 --> 31:23.923
babysit you creeps.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.676
We're out of here.

31:25.759 --> 31:28.554
Try not to get man-raped

31:25.759 --> 31:28.554
down here, unless you want to.

31:28.637 --> 31:29.763
Let's go, ladies.

31:29.847 --> 31:32.516
Ricky:

31:29.847 --> 31:32.516
See you, girls.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.184
Oh, this is

31:32.599 --> 31:34.184
fucked, Julian.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.436
What are we gonna do?

31:34.267 --> 31:36.436
We're fucked now.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.772
Bubs, we're not fucked.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.733
We're officially on

31:38.856 --> 31:40.733
vacation right now.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.735
(Laughs)

31:40.816 --> 31:42.735
They're not with us.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.069
This is fucking

31:42.818 --> 31:44.069
awesome, boys.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.904
This is not awesome.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.904
Ricky...

31:45.987 --> 31:48.574
Julian:

31:45.987 --> 31:48.574
Ricky, don't lay on

31:45.987 --> 31:48.574
the bed like that, man.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.950
Ricky, shove over.

31:51.034 --> 31:53.286
Lay this way, all

31:51.034 --> 31:53.286
three of us have got

31:51.034 --> 31:53.286
to fit in there.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.039
What... Bubs, we're not

31:53.370 --> 31:56.039
sleeping in this bed, man.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.708
Why not?

31:56.122 --> 31:57.708
It's huge.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.334
Think about it.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.547
Ohh... load bed!

32:01.754 --> 32:03.547
Yeah!

32:03.630 --> 32:07.300
Load bed. Ricky,

32:03.630 --> 32:07.300
roll onto your back.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.010
Don't have your face

32:07.384 --> 32:09.010
in those sheets.

32:09.094 --> 32:12.180
Okay, well, rock-paper

32:09.094 --> 32:12.180
for the bathtub then.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.516
Rock-paper to see

32:12.264 --> 32:14.516
who sleeps in the tub.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.810
Fuck's sakes.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.810
One, two, Bubbles wins.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.478
(Giggles)

32:16.894 --> 32:18.478
Bubs...

32:18.562 --> 32:22.023
I'm going in the bathroom.

32:18.562 --> 32:22.023
Sleeping in the tub.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.484
Where the fuck am

32:22.107 --> 32:24.484
I gonna sleep?

32:22.107 --> 32:24.484
Comfy, comfy.

32:24.568 --> 32:27.195
Bubbles:

32:24.568 --> 32:27.195
Argh, there's a great

32:24.568 --> 32:27.195
big shit in the toilet.

32:28.988 --> 32:31.074
(Doorknob rattling)

32:28.988 --> 32:31.074
Julian!

32:28.988 --> 32:31.074
What?

32:31.157 --> 32:33.660
Bubbles:

32:31.157 --> 32:33.660
Let me out! It won't flush

32:31.157 --> 32:33.660
and there's no lights.

32:33.744 --> 32:36.538
It's just dark and

32:33.744 --> 32:36.538
shitty in here!

32:36.622 --> 32:38.498
Have a good

32:36.622 --> 32:38.498
sleep, bud.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.459
Fuck.

32:40.542 --> 32:44.421
