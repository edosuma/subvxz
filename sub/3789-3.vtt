01:12.698 --> 01:14.407
How you doing?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.909
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, honey, how are you?

01:16.994 --> 01:19.287
If I was you, I'd save some energy
for the Mansion, bro.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.914
I got plenty of energy
in my reserve tanks, Drama,

01:21.999 --> 01:24.041
- don't you worry.
- Turtle, you don't want to wind up

01:24.126 --> 01:26.461
with a girlfriend
one day before the lingerie party.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.546
Good point. I ain't talking to none of youse.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.298
I don't know what you guys
are making a big deal about.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.883
I've been to the Mansion, it's not that great.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.886
You were at an afternoon
fundraiser for Alzheimer's.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.472
I don't think that's what Mr. Hefner
had in mind when he opened the joint.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.223
I'm sure he was dreaming about your fat ass

01:39.308 --> 01:42.101
- running around the place in pajamas.
- Easy, easy.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.978
Yeah, I remember back in the day

01:44.062 --> 01:46.105
me, Kadeem Hardison and C.T. Howell

01:46.190 --> 01:48.941
used to sit at Hef's table
surrounded by Playmates.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.110
Now they won't even let me in the joint.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.446
You sat at Hugh Hefner's table?

01:53.530 --> 01:55.531
Yeah, during the Melrose years.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.534
Don't you mean
the Melrose months, Drama?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.453
Not if you count reruns, dickhead.

02:00.537 --> 02:04.081
Oh, don't worry, Johnny.
E will have you doing laps in The Grotto.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.209
- Right, E?
- Yeah, Shauna's calling Hef's people

02:06.293 --> 02:08.419
to see what Drama's drama is this time.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.672
- I didn't do anything.
- So, these are for the Mansion, right, Vince?

02:11.757 --> 02:14.592
Yeah. Mom's out of town,
I got the kids tonight.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.469
Okay, well then you don't want to wear those,

02:16.553 --> 02:18.054
because George Clooney's guy came in

02:18.138 --> 02:19.972
and bought the exact same pair this morning.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.308
It'd be like wearing
the same gown to the Oscars.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.603
Yeah. Nobody has these.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.856
I will make sure that we don't sell
any more for the rest of the day.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.317
Fancy. Thanks, Jenny.
- No problem.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.069
Don't work too hard, huh?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.238
Vince, can you advance me six weeks' salary?

02:35.322 --> 02:37.698
You know the system, Turtle. Ask E.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.494
E, can I please advance six weeks' salary?

02:41.578 --> 02:42.995
What do you need $1,200 for?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.997
For these cashmere PJs, baby!

02:45.082 --> 02:46.874
Turtle, mine only cost $400.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.001
You can go to the Mansion
in Underoos and still get laid.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.838
You could go wrapped
in bearer bonds and not get laid.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.340
- Put the pajamas back.
- I'm coming back for these.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.926
Feel how soft. Feel.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.262
Bearer bonds.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.430
Lemon water and lettuce, Drama?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.723
You disgust me.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.643
It's all part of my
two-day pre-Mansion regimen.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.353
I got to look lean for the ladies.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.356
Why don't you sleep in Saran Wrap
like you did on the wrestling team?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.066
I sucked weight in that sauna suit.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.069
If you behave yourself, Turtle,
I might just put you on my program.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.737
Did Playboy even call back?

03:16.822 --> 03:19.407
I'm waiting. God knows what you did
to piss off Hef, Drama.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.201
- I didn't do anything.
- Wait. Can we talk about the house?

03:22.286 --> 03:24.662
- Let's talk about it, Marvin.
- There's nothing to talk about!

03:24.746 --> 03:26.372
You guys got to get out.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.542
The studio paid for five months
and you've been there for a year.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.919
We should rent a place
with an outdoor pool anyway.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.422
- Maybe I should buy a place.
That's a good idea.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.632
I could be the first Chase
to own his own home.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.344
Sorry, bro. I beat you to that.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.640
Johnny, I've been doing
your taxes since 1989.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.393
You never owned a home.
What are you talking about?

03:47.477 --> 03:50.479
Condo? Triplex? On Robertson?

03:50.814 --> 03:53.399
South Robertson?
You lived next to the 10 freeway, Drama.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.776
That place. You only had it for six months,

03:55.861 --> 03:57.904
and then they foreclosed on it.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.447
That don't count.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.449
Technically, it still makes me first.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.409
Technically, you're a fucking moron.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.620
- What's our price range?
- What's on the burner?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.830
We're meeting with Warner's
to discuss Aquaman.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.999
- That's what I wanna hear.
- Aquaman.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.667
You'd make a sexy superhero.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.960
I'm going to hear what they have to say.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.588
- Vince is gonna consider doing this.
- Oh, I am?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.589
Remember, sweetie,
one for them, one for you.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.884
Queens Boulevard was definitely one for you.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.261
Okay, assuming I do another one for me,

04:22.346 --> 04:24.263
how much can we spend on a house?

04:24.681 --> 04:27.266
A million, a million-two tops.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.435
I'll call Susan Roberts.
She's the best broker in town.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.312
$1 million, guys.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.231
We were sharing a two-bedroom
on Seward a year and a half ago.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.359
- Not bad!
- Not bad?

04:36.443 --> 04:39.612
My mom just sold her house for $160,000,

04:39.696 --> 04:41.238
and we had a skylight.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.828
This is it?

04:48.705 --> 04:49.789
Maybe this is the guesthouse,

04:49.873 --> 04:51.082
and the real house is around back?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.675
Craftsman's are very hot right now, Vince.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.386
I just sold one to that actor from Smallville.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.722
Where's Smallville?

05:19.903 --> 05:21.696
No way. Not again.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.744
A million bucks sure ain't what it used to be.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.912
You're not kidding.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.539
You can't be living in a dump like this.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.583
- It's bad for your self-esteem.
- They don't even have a pool.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.252
You used to work at a mortuary, Turtle.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.004
Why don't you grab a shovel
and start digging?

05:38.088 --> 05:39.672
What, E, you think we should take it?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.173
No, definitely not.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.342
I know it's a bit of a fixer-upper,

05:43.427 --> 05:45.511
but you are getting in at a great price

05:45.595 --> 05:47.179
in an up-and-coming neighborhood.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.848
You know, to tell you the truth, Susan,

05:48.932 --> 05:50.808
it's not exactly what we had in mind.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.226
What did you have in mind?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.936
Have you ever seen Cribs?

05:55.022 --> 05:59.859
I have a Spanish estate up at Outpost.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.028
It was Marlon Brando's old place.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.530
I like Brando.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.033
It's in a slightly higher price range, though.

06:07.117 --> 06:10.202
- How slight?
- Don't worry about it. It's Brando's.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.787
I'll set it up.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.708
Hey, Shauna.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.710
I just got off the phone
with the Playboy people.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.087
- Drama straightened out?
- He's straightened out all right.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.214
He's banned for life. There's a better chance

06:22.299 --> 06:24.550
- you'll see the Pope in pajamas.
- Why, what'd he do?

06:24.634 --> 06:27.094
The moron went to Hef's zoo,
set all the chimps free.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.263
- Unbelievable.
- One of the monkeys

06:29.347 --> 06:30.806
went Siegfried & Roy on Miss August,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.934
and they said she's lost out on becoming
the Saturn national spokesperson

06:34.019 --> 06:35.644
because of the damage to her face.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.563
Okay, look, I got to go.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.982
What's next?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.485
Got to get the Godiva chocolates
for Star Jones.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.653
Better make room in the fucking trunk.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.073
This is bullshit. It was Macchio.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.742
- "The Karate Kid" freed the monkeys?
- I'm not kidding.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.744
I took him as my "plus one. "

06:51.828 --> 06:53.162
We got wasted on Cuervo.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.540
Next thing I know, he's standing
in the Miyagi crane position

06:56.625 --> 06:58.292
kicking the cage wide open.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.627
Well, Hef thinks it was you.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.587
Yeah, I know.
What are we gonna do about it?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.423
- "We," Drama?
- Yeah, we.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.425
You guys wouldn't go
to the Mansion without me.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.720
- Right?
- Don't worry.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.597
We'll bring you back a Playmate doggie bag.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.600
Come on, guys.
If Johnny doesn't go, none of us goes.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.769
- Thanks, bro.
- In fact, Ari's got to handle this,

07:16.853 --> 07:19.146
or we're headed for dollar shots
at Beefsteak Charlie's.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.314
Fucking Drama!

07:20.524 --> 07:23.442
Wait. They don't even have
a Beefsteak Charlie's out here. Do they?

07:23.527 --> 07:24.568
Shut up, Turtle.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.487
I guess I'll keep my appointment for Uvasun.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.531
First you got to come with me to
get my pajamas.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.866
- Sure.
- Where you gonna get the money from?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.536
Don't worry about that. I got a plan.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.171
That's an assigned space, Ari.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.007
Fuck Peter Hill! Never heard of him.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.300
I hope they tow you.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.844
They don't have the balls. Trust me.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.304
Ari, we got to call Hugh Hefner
to get Drama's ban

07:52.389 --> 07:54.640
- lifted at the Mansion.
- What am I, his pimp?

07:54.724 --> 07:56.392
- Ari.
- For you, Vinnie, anything.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.894
All I ask in return
is that you say yes to Aquaman.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.021
He's here, Ari. One step at a time.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.649
Don't you mean one stroke at a time?

08:06.778 --> 08:09.029
I can't give you a cash refund for this, Turtle.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.656
It was a gift from corporate to Vince.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.366
Come on, Cathy, hook me up.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.910
I'll throw in an eighth
of the Hack's Crip weed you like.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.537
That's a very generous offer, Turtle,

08:16.621 --> 08:18.622
but I'm a friend of Bill W's now.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.999
And he's got better weed than the Hack?

08:20.417 --> 08:23.419
"Bill W"'s code. It means she's in recovery.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.838
Who needs to recover from weed?

08:25.922 --> 08:28.507
Tell you what, Turtle,
I'll give you a store credit.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.010
What the fuck am I gonna do with that?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.936
We want you in the Warner family, Vince.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.563
I'm all about family, John.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.691
In fact, after seeing your 200-foot yacht

08:45.775 --> 08:48.152
in last month's Robb Report,
can I call you Dad?

08:51.448 --> 08:52.740
- Vince?
- Yeah.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.117
Do you know how long
Clint Eastwood's been with this studio?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.953
- No.
- 70 years.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.874
We give him $90 million to make movies now.

09:01.958 --> 09:05.211
- Does whatever he wants.
- I heard he uses 60 and pockets 30.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.046
That's why he only does one take.

09:09.174 --> 09:12.384
The point is,
we don't micromanage our talent here.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.678
No. They are very talent-friendly.

09:15.305 --> 09:19.058
Wow, you know, I mean, this all sounds great.

09:19.142 --> 09:22.728
And I'd love to make a movie
with you guys, definitely.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.522
It's just I don't really
see myself playing a superhero,

09:26.024 --> 09:27.733
speaking underwater, flying.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.904
We're not talking about making
a comic book fluff movie here.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.073
No, we want this to be a darker, grittier film.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.451
Remember, this is the studio
that did Batman, right?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.453
Not The Phantom.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.163
What are we talking about?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.165
Burton's Batman or Schumacher's?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.881
Why don't you let us show you
what we're talking about?

09:50.966 --> 09:52.174
Sure.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.426
Dana, let's bring in the suit.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.350
Bring in the suit.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.447
Yeah. Isn't that something?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.367
Isn't that something?

10:18.451 --> 10:22.037
No way I'm gonna be up on a 70-foot screen
looking like an underwater Elton John.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.124
Vinnie, the suit will not look like that on film.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.042
Tom Cruise is, like, 5'4",

10:27.127 --> 10:29.086
on screen he looks like Yao Ming.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.796
- It's just a prototype, Vince.
- Yeah!

10:30.880 --> 10:33.299
Ari, it's over.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.926
Do not mention this movie to me again.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.970
All right, now find me
something else I can do.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.389
I'll deal with this.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.646
How you doing, sweetheart?
I got a M.A. C store credit.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.565
- No.
- $2,000 for $1,200!

10:50.233 --> 10:51.650
Better hurry this shit up, Turtle.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.319
We're gonna be late
for our mannies and peddies.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.447
All right, hold on.
I got a M.A. C store credit here.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.741
$2,000 for $1,200!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.409
Or if you have a major credit card,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.578
you can come with me
to Barneys and buy me my pajamas!

11:03.079 --> 11:06.165
All right, the suit sucks,
but the script is good.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.459
I'm telling you, Vince,
this movie is gonna be a big hit,

11:08.543 --> 11:10.085
and then you can do whatever you want.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.505
It's weird how you're
starting to sound like Ari.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.425
No, it's weird how you always
want me to agree with you.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.056
Cashmere PJs paid in full

11:22.140 --> 11:24.016
no thanks to your ass!

11:25.602 --> 11:27.144
Something's wrong.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.313
Is this Aquaman-related

11:29.397 --> 11:30.856
or am I not going to the Mansion?

11:30.940 --> 11:32.566
No, Ari is taking care of the Mansion,

11:32.650 --> 11:34.735
we're not talking about Aquaman anymore.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.154
They showed Vince the suit and he hated it.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.281
That's 'cause Vince ain't a costume guy.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.241
On Halloween this guy goes
dressed as himself.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.659
Thank you, Turtle!

11:43.328 --> 11:45.329
You see, he knows me.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.122
Maybe I should let him be my manager.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.833
Charge you 5%. This guy's ripping you off.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.545
You know, Vince, wearing a costume
can be very liberating as an actor.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.924
You remember how much
I enjoyed being a Power Ranger.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.134
You were a Power Ranger on CityWalk.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.428
You were trying to get people
to change their long-distance plan.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.472
- So? It's still liberating.
- Look,

12:03.556 --> 12:06.517
Johnny, I don't wanna wear the Aquaman suit,
or any other suit.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.145
In fact, I don't want to play anyone
who doesn't wear a T-shirt.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.400
- Hey.
- Is that Ari? Is that Ari?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.360
Hey. Hold on a second.

12:16.694 --> 12:17.861
- Okay.
- Ask him about the Mansion.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.446
Tomorrow morning? See you then.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.698
- Yo, yo.
- Relax. It's the realtor.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.826
We're going to look at Brando's house
first thing in the morning.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.494
Brando.
- Brando.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.510
Now that's a house worth living in.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.346
This is one of Marlon's first homes.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.016
He sold it to Johnny Depp in '95.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.811
Johnny was living here
when he was making Ed Wood.

12:50.895 --> 12:51.937
Great movie.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.064
Johnny Depp's got the kind of career I want.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.983
Johnny Depp did Pirates ofthe Caribbean.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.277
If I'm not mistaken,
he wore a swashbuckler costume

12:58.361 --> 12:59.403
and carried a sword.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.655
I heard he dresses like that in real life.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.199
Nice!

13:04.284 --> 13:06.994
And by the way,
wasn't Marlon Brando in Superman?

13:07.078 --> 13:09.496
Yeah, he played the father, no tights.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.833
And by the way, you're starting to annoy me.

13:13.376 --> 13:16.003
On a clear day, you can see Catalina.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.755
This is where you should be living, Vince.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.966
In a kingdom, like a prince.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.260
Don't you mean a kingdom
like a king, you idiot?

13:23.344 --> 13:26.054
Nah, E, everyone wants to kill the king.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.056
But the prince, he just sails along

13:28.141 --> 13:31.101
telling all the ladies,
"One day I'm gonna be king. "

13:31.769 --> 13:33.270
Queen's got it pretty good too.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.564
Queen's got to fuck the king, Drama.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.859
Yeah, but she don't got to do nothing else.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.028
I love this place, Susan. How much is it?

13:41.112 --> 13:42.654
They're asking 4.3,

13:42.739 --> 13:44.656
but the owner is a real star-fucker.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.701
If I tell her it's for you,
I'm sure she'll drop to four even.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.287
That's great,
it's only four times our price range.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.998
But it's at least
nine times nicer than that Craftsman.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.958
So you'd still be coming back out on top.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.919
I love your math skills, Turtle.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.546
I'll take it. Call Marv,
have him start the paperwork.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.756
Okay.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.550
You can't afford this house, Vince.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.178
I can't afford anything we have.
Never stopped me before.

14:06.429 --> 14:07.846
It's always worked out.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.264
Besides, we don't have time to house-hunt.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.599
We got to get a job.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.186
Ari. What's up?

14:14.270 --> 14:15.896
I just had a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Hef.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.439
- How'd it go?
- The good news is

14:17.524 --> 14:19.942
I just sold Playboy TV to North Korea.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.360
Kim Jong II loves Night Calls.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.238
Bad news is, your boy Drama
will not be joining us.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.491
Ari, you carry about as much weight
as Lara Flynn Boyle.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.368
A lifetime ban is a lifetime ban.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.037
Who are we without our integrity, right?
A little break at the slipper.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.832
That was Ari.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.751
No go, Drama. I'm sorry.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.712
It's not the Mansion, but we can
always have chicken wings at Hooters?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.800
Nah, this is my problem.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.636
I'll deal with it.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.948
- Hey, buddy.
- Johnny Drama.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.283
What the heck are you doing here?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.451
I want you to call up Hugh Hefner

15:11.536 --> 15:14.037
and tell him it was you
that freed the monkeys.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.872
When were you
at the Playboy Mansion, Ralph?

15:15.957 --> 15:19.001
That was over 10 years ago, honey.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.504
My life is different now, John.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.006
I'm a daddy.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.467
You know?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.761
- You crazy, fucker?
- Just make the call.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.471
I'm not into that game anymore, all right?

15:31.556 --> 15:33.390
- I got a new series now.
- Really?

15:33.474 --> 15:35.100
Well, you know, it's a pilot.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.102
But I don't know shit
about any monkeys, Drama.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.646
Bullshit. I remember you
screaming the PETA chant

15:39.731 --> 15:41.315
- right before you freed them.
- PETA?

15:41.399 --> 15:42.566
You got the wrong guy, asshole.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.109
I bought my wife a chinchilla coat.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.486
- If it wasn't you, then who did it?
- How should I know?

15:46.571 --> 15:48.071
We were drunk off our asses.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.199
Come on, Ralph. You're married.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.368
You got a family. You got a life.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.037
I got nothing but the Mansion.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.788
Can't you make the phone call?

15:56.873 --> 15:58.832
Drama, when it comes to the Mansion,

15:58.916 --> 16:00.250
it's every man for himself.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.169
But you said you're done with all that.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.671
I lied. I'm going tonight.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.174
I ought to kick your ass.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.800
You wanna try?

16:10.887 --> 16:12.387
I'll deal with you later.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.723
See you tonight, motherfucker!

16:16.184 --> 16:17.893
I hope so, John.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.020
Pound some Cuervo like the old days, huh?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.660
Turtle, you know you forgot to take
the price-tags off your pajamas?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.745
I didn't forget. I'm returning these Monday.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.121
Guy's a genius.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.667
What's the use of spending
$1,200 on PJs if nobody knows it?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.919
You're all class, Turtle.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.841
- Hey, Marvin.
- Eric, put Vince on the phone.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.803
It's Marvin. He wants to talk to you.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.429
He's right here!

16:57.392 --> 16:58.684
Hey, Marvin!

16:58.768 --> 17:01.853
When you asked me how much you could
spend on a house, what did I tell you?

17:01.938 --> 17:04.271
- You were a little vague.
- "Vague"? Bullshit!

17:04.357 --> 17:06.775
I told you you could spend $1 million.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.319
I'm spending less than that.
The bank is coming up with the rest.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.613
Vince, you cannot afford that house.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.865
At best, you could last
for a couple of months.

17:13.950 --> 17:17.202
Then what? You're gonna be
out on the street like your brother.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.286
And you know what?

17:18.371 --> 17:21.373
You don't have a younger brother
like you to mooch off.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.041
Marv, I can't hear you. You're breaking up.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.292
I'm up in the hills...

17:26.128 --> 17:27.212
He's angry.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.562
Where are you going, Ari?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.773
I have a meeting, so...

17:47.150 --> 17:48.775
At the Playboy Mansion?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.948
You know, Playboy Mansion,
strip clubs, whorehouses...

17:55.032 --> 17:57.576
I go where the meetings are.
It's my fucking job.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.120
I want three weeks in the south
of France with the children.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.955
Oh, my God, baby!

18:02.623 --> 18:04.958
- Of course you can go.
- With you.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.419
And if you're not home by 2:00 a. m.,

18:07.503 --> 18:08.920
I'm gonna be standing at the gate screaming,

18:09.005 --> 18:11.673
"Ari Gold, super agent, forgot his Viagra!"

18:12.925 --> 18:14.092
Sounds good.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.598
Can you pop your trunk, please?

18:20.391 --> 18:22.225
Trunk's broken, buddy.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.691
Pop your trunk, please.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.861
All right.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.955
- Pat!
- Drama, you wanna get out of there?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.957
Hey, we got another stowaway, partner.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.086
Pat, I've known you for, like, 10 years.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.713
Can't you guys let me slide?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.006
Not a shot in hell.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.593
Do you know bringing in stowaways
can get you banned for life?

18:56.677 --> 18:59.137
It's not their fault.
They didn't know I was in the car.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.223
Guys, it was my idea.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.641
- I told him to.
Don't listen to him.

19:02.725 --> 19:05.310
He's my kid brother
and he's trying to take the blame.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.645
Johnny.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.688
Go on, go have fun. Don't worry about me.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.108
My night's done.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.819
Can you call me a cab?

19:13.903 --> 19:16.446
Try using your thumb down on Sunset.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.198
Patrick.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.788
Would you look at all
the nice fake titties in this place?

20:06.873 --> 20:07.956
I thought you liked naturals.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.542
I believe in a woman's right to choose.

20:10.626 --> 20:14.087
- Nice pajamas.
- It's formal nightwear, but thank you.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.630
That's it, this is proof.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.632
God is definitely a man.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.510
Excuse me, sweetheart.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.099
Good luck returning those.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.811
Sorry.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.314
Fuck!

20:36.193 --> 20:37.485
Yeah!

20:38.237 --> 20:40.030
Hey, get out of the street, you faggot!

20:40.114 --> 20:43.158
- Nice legs, fudge packer!
- Fuck you!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.826
Right here, college boys!

20:49.332 --> 20:50.332
What?

20:50.416 --> 20:51.750
Yo, Drama.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.586
I detected a weakness in Hef's security detail.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.463
I'm not coming back.
I'm almost home already.

20:56.547 --> 20:57.839
I took care of you as always, all right?

20:57.924 --> 21:01.051
Just come back to where it all began,
the monkey cages.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.470
I know you don't
want to talk about it right now.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.472
I had an amazing meeting at Warner's.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.058
Ari, please don't ruin the Mansion.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.226
You're gonna want to hear this, believe me.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.811
You know what I want to hear?

21:11.896 --> 21:13.980
I want to hear what
the lovely Hef girls have to say.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.399
Look how rude you are,
with your back to these lovely ladies.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.943
They're better to look at than listen to.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.528
What do you got?
Sorry. What do you got for us?

21:20.613 --> 21:22.614
What does the middle "A" stand for, Ari?

21:22.698 --> 21:23.990
Arrogant?

21:24.075 --> 21:25.909
- Abrasive?
- Argumentative?

21:25.993 --> 21:28.036
- Annoying?
- Asshole?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.121
Et tu, Vinnie? Et tu?

21:36.879 --> 21:38.254
You okay?

21:40.383 --> 21:41.466
Good job, kid.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.968
- Hey, did you see Macchio?
- No.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.178
- Keep your eyes open.
- All right, come on.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.181
Yeah, well, the thing is,
once the show hits syndication,

21:48.265 --> 21:50.475
you got to like find
some tax deductions, you know.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.810
Vince, I'm telling you...

21:51.894 --> 21:54.479
Real estate? Best investment ever.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.189
See, if it's not acting,

21:56.273 --> 21:57.607
we'll make our money through real estate.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.484
I should start commissioning
some of your capital gains

21:59.568 --> 22:02.529
so I can start seeing
some income out of this relationship.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.239
Oh, shit. Miss April.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.574
Guys, I got to hide. I'll see you in a bit.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.911
Guy's got three houses, we don't have one.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.121
He's a worker, though, Vince.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.498
The guy does a TV show,
a radio show, he's a D.J.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.624
He does a million things.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.502
You do Aquaman,
you got five houses. Boom.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.338
Don't you need to be home to your wife, Ari?

22:20.423 --> 22:22.340
No, I make the goddamn rules.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.300
I got till 2:00.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.761
What are you saying? You're pissing me off!

22:26.846 --> 22:28.972
Don't get in my face.
What are you getting in my face about?

22:29.056 --> 22:30.849
- Just be a man and admit it!
- Johnny!

22:30.933 --> 22:32.934
- Admit you did it!
- I told you I didn't do it.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.019
- Admit it!
- I didn't do it!

22:34.103 --> 22:37.022
I already told you that,
you ex-evening soap star!

22:37.106 --> 22:39.858
- I did an indie, asshole!
- Excuse me. Johnny!

22:39.942 --> 22:42.527
Johnny Chase. The Monkey Boy.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.653
- Hef.
- Vince.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.947
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.115
Johnny's my brother,

22:47.199 --> 22:49.617
and he swears it wasn't him
that let the monkeys free.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.745
Well, what's the real story, John?

22:51.829 --> 22:54.622
Well, Mr. Hefner, I'm not one to rat,

22:55.291 --> 22:56.916
but it was this guy that sprung the apes.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.418
With all due respect, Mr. Hefner,

22:58.502 --> 23:00.295
I never went near that zoo, never.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.089
Well, you boys better remember who did,

23:03.174 --> 23:05.300
or you're both out of here.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.593
It was a long time ago.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.053
And we were so drunk.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.472
We were sitting at that table
by The Grotto over there.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.265
We were banging out shots of Cuervo and...

23:12.349 --> 23:14.350
It was me and you and...

23:16.812 --> 23:18.438
Pauly!

23:18.522 --> 23:20.065
Let the fuck go of me!

23:20.149 --> 23:22.817
That's my fucking bad arm, you piece of shits!

23:22.902 --> 23:25.820
They shouldn't be locked up
in cages in this house and you know it.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.572
I'm gonna fucking get you, bro!

23:27.656 --> 23:29.908
- Get him out of here.
- Lifetime ban, Pauly.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.701
Oh, bro, no!

23:33.454 --> 23:35.580
I think he just called Hugh Hefner "bro. "

23:35.664 --> 23:37.123
I'm sorry, guys.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.542
Sorry, Vince.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.419
- Thank you, Mr. Hefner.
- You have a good time.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.130
- Thank you, Mr. Heffner.
- And behave yourselves.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.757
- We will.
I appreciate it.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.926
Thanks, Hef! Good night!

23:48.010 --> 23:49.219
Yes, I'm back.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.013
- Bro, thank you!
- Of course.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.349
Ralph, man, sorry about that.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.518
- I had you wrong.
- Come on, let's get a drink.

23:56.644 --> 23:59.145
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll talk about that pilot.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.356
Listen, there's nothing in it for you.

24:11.075 --> 24:14.244
Hey, Vince, we gonna throw parties
like this at the new house?

24:14.328 --> 24:17.122
No. E doesn't think we can
afford the new house.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.207
E's a fucking buzz kill.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.792
I thought you don't need all the toys, Vince?

24:20.876 --> 24:22.544
Yeah, I don't need them. I like them.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.963
The worst thing that happens
is they kick you out.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.715
They give you time
to pack up your shit, bro, trust me.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.175
They ain't kicking us out, all right?

24:29.260 --> 24:31.094
Vince is a superstar.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.804
If it ain't this, it's something else.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.723
M.C. Hammer could've used a guy
like you, Turtle, back in the day.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.434
I don't know about you,
but I'm in this for the long haul.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.645
Oh, yeah, what do you think we're in it for?

24:40.729 --> 24:44.065
Well, I don't know.
Did you really hate the script?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.859
No. I mean, I liked it.

24:46.527 --> 24:49.195
I don't wanna end up
looking like an idiot on the screen.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.322
Wow. I've never seen you this insecure.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.992
I'm not insecure.
I'm just not confident enough to think

24:54.076 --> 24:56.703
- that I can be a superhero.
- Now that I see an opening,

24:56.787 --> 24:59.414
Warner's is willing to bank $100 million

24:59.498 --> 25:02.000
on the fact that you are a superhero.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.127
They loved you so much in the meeting today,

25:04.211 --> 25:07.297
they want to shoot back-to-back movies,
like Lord ofthe Rings.

25:07.381 --> 25:10.216
That do anything for your confidence?
They wanna give you

25:10.301 --> 25:13.178
five for the first, seven for the second.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.013
God willing, if there is a third,

25:15.097 --> 25:17.849
they want to give you 12. Boom!

25:17.933 --> 25:20.894
That's like $50-fucking-million, Vince.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.520
No, it's 12.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.899
That's $1.2 million for E.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.859
And I'm still gonna be making $200 a week?

25:28.152 --> 25:30.570
That's bullshit, Vince. Raise!

25:30.654 --> 25:33.823
Vince, you wanna buy that house?
Do this movie.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.369
All right.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.166
Can you get me suit approval?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.751
You can wear tube socks and a yarmulka!

25:51.800 --> 25:53.343
All right, fuck it. Lock it down.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.178
That's what I'm talking about!

25:55.262 --> 25:56.512
Nice working, baby!

25:56.597 --> 25:58.556
Hey, you know, Aquaman's got a brother.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.391
I'm just saying.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.018
I'm telling you he's got a brother.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.354
God damn, I wish I wasn't married!

26:04.730 --> 26:06.397
"Aqua-brother" right here.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.734
He's betting you the 0.2! It was 1.2!

26:09.818 --> 26:11.861
I'm telling you, Aquaman's got a brother.

26:11.946 --> 26:12.946
No, he doesn't.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.198
ARl:
We need more jungle juice for the kids!
