00:01.000 --> 00:02.440
REG: Thought we were going
to Ghosties.

00:02.440 --> 00:04.040
That place isn't even real.

00:04.040 --> 00:06.160
I've surfed it!
Oh, you have not!

00:06.160 --> 00:09.880
How's it goin', Mr Colston?
Tania. Ladies.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.280
You can do anything you want.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.920
I know.
That's why I'm leaving school.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.520
Surprise.
Hi.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.480
Hey. Um... I'm Tash.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.120
Look, this is really confusing
for me.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.120
For YOU?

00:25.120 --> 00:26.720
Did you fuck that woman in Bali?

00:26.720 --> 00:27.720
No.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.360
You owe me a US licence fee.
$10,000 US.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.880
We're on it, mate, trust me.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.960
Do you know what the street value
of that little packet is?

00:33.960 --> 00:35.720
Not smack, mate.
This is way too heavy.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.640
I am gonna start making board shorts,

00:38.640 --> 00:41.320
and Bare Feet's
are gonna shit all over yours.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.560
We're expanding the business.
Into what?

00:43.560 --> 00:45.040
Wetsuits.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.840
('BOOGIE (PART 1)' BY CARSON PLAYS)

01:10.760 --> 01:15.360
SONG:
# I'm a wolfman, darlin', on my knees

01:17.760 --> 01:22.440
# I'm a wolfman, darlin', on my knees

01:23.840 --> 01:26.600
# Cryin', "Lord, Lord!"

01:26.600 --> 01:28.800

01:38.480 --> 01:43.480
# I'm a jackal bayin' at the moon

01:43.480 --> 01:44.800
# Ouw

01:44.800 --> 01:47.560
# Cryin', "Lord, Lord!"

01:47.560 --> 01:49.880
# "Lord, help me see..." #

01:53.280 --> 01:55.560
I'm out. We're done.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.000
How was it?
You need a towel, hon'?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.200
The numbers
keep spinning around in my head.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.800
I've tried it every way.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.440
It just cannot work.

02:06.440 --> 02:07.920
We tried.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.000
We failed.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
That's OK.
I think he needs a towel.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.920
There's Gina's up-front

02:13.920 --> 02:17.520
before we can even start
to fill the order for Carroways,

02:17.520 --> 02:22.160
and that is after we find the cash
to pay Trotter's licence fee.

02:22.160 --> 02:26.240
Buddy, do you know how much money we
have in our bank account right now?

02:26.240 --> 02:28.040
I'm gonna go get him a towel.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.200
I've got a plan.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.000
Me. S Kwong. Bali.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.640
Did you hear what I just said?

02:38.640 --> 02:42.080
Yeah. Yeah.
We need to sell more shorts, right?

02:42.080 --> 02:45.000
OK, then we need
a new, shit-hot campaign.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.680
I've been talking to Mac.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.360
You remember
how I did that deal with Snap?

02:53.360 --> 02:55.120
Dude, do you wanna go to jail?

02:55.120 --> 02:57.200
Mac's been running a bit hot lately.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.280
Thinks he's being watched. Probably
shouldn't inhale 'shrooms every day.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.680
But, anyway,
he's got this big deal going down.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.240
He needs a cover story.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.720
And he'll pay cash.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.560
We can cover Trotter's licence fee
and Gina's up-front. Most of it.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.440
Jesus, Bud.
Come on!

03:12.440 --> 03:14.720
This at least
gets us out of the hole.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.760
And what about Shirley?
What about Shirley?

03:17.760 --> 03:21.840
She's just gonna shoot the campaign.
She knows nothing. She's safe.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.320
Do you have to carry anything?

03:28.320 --> 03:30.040
No.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.240
Here, hon'.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.760
I got you a Valium too.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.520
OK, did you get one for ME?

03:37.520 --> 03:39.480
This guy needs it more.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.400
Dude.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.000
Are we doing this?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.320
You.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.320
Shirley.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.520
Bali.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.400
Yes! (CLAPS)

03:52.400 --> 03:54.320
Can I come?
BOTH: No.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.600
(WAVES CRASH)

04:06.920 --> 04:09.040
So, where else do you suggest I try?

04:10.040 --> 04:11.160
No, don't put me on...

04:12.160 --> 04:14.320
How can there be no rubber
in the whole country?

04:14.320 --> 04:16.520
It's out there somewhere.
Yeah, your dad has it.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.400
He's not going to give YOU
the Bare Feet contract.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.640
I'm the one who set it up.
Exactly.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.720
Yeah, I'll take all the raw stock
that you've got.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.320
Yeah, everything.

04:25.320 --> 04:29.880
And, uh...if anything else comes in,
you'll call me first, yeah?

04:29.880 --> 04:32.200
We don't even have
the right machines to make wetsuits.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.520
Every single one of Snapper's
wetsuits is based on MY designs.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.520
Mm.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.280
Me, me, my, my.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.600
Us. I'm doing this for us.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.600
I don't even surf.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.240
You like that house, though,
don't ya?

04:43.240 --> 04:44.560
I never wanted the house.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.440
Well, thank you very much, mate.
I'll owe you big-time.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.240
Yeah, Snap!

04:49.240 --> 04:51.080
Try making wetsuits without rubber!

04:51.080 --> 04:52.840
I think I might start
that meditating,

04:52.840 --> 04:55.160
experience some of this incredible
peace you've got going on, Snap.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.760
Piss off, Reg.
Hey, there's my mantra.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.560
I know these guys. They'll give us
a good deal on a machine.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.960
Mm. Pull the trigger.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.320
Don't do it, Jules.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.360
Do it, Jules.
Put down the phone.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.840
Don't look at him.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.320
We need another machine. Call them.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.640
What we need is a regular house

05:10.640 --> 05:12.720
that won't make us look
like a couple of try-hards.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.160
Right, Jules?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.760
I actually quite like that house.
Thank you, Jules.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.120
It's a shame you don't
have any money to fix it up.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.720
It's coming. I paid the deposit.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.960
As soon as the rest
comes from the US, we're moving in.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.840
What about the roof?

05:24.840 --> 05:26.640
What about all the leaks?
They'll be fine.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.440
You just hate this place, and then
as soon as I buy you a house,

05:29.440 --> 05:31.520
you change your tune
to complain about that.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.520
YOU buy ME a house?
That is OUR money.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.240
Exactly. Let's start enjoying it.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.160
I mean, don't you want your brother
to have his own room...

05:38.160 --> 05:39.880
Don't drag me into this.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.080
Don't help him, Jules.
This whole thing is stupid.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.800
And, Dimma,
don't you sleep in all day.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.240
Love you.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.600
You still want me to call?
Ask them if they've got two.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.040
We're expanding!

05:59.040 --> 06:02.520
(WAVES CRASH)

06:02.520 --> 06:04.080
Snap.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.400
Hey, Reggie.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.800
G'day, Dim.
Choc.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.520
How's your board, Dim?

06:09.520 --> 06:10.840
Unreal.

06:10.840 --> 06:11.840
Right.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.080
Hey, Trot!
How's the wetsuit business?

06:15.080 --> 06:16.960
Yeah, good, Choc.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.440
Tell your boss thanks for asking.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.040
Tell him yourself.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.040
Ask him about his rubber.
How much rubber you got?

06:25.040 --> 06:26.200
I'll be right.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.560
Reckon it'll be hard
to buy from people

06:27.560 --> 06:28.920
who've been loyal to Bare Feet, but.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.840
Oh, you bastard.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.320
You locked me out.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.680
I don't know
what you're talking about, mate.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.760
Come on, Choccie!

06:41.760 --> 06:43.240
You started it.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.360
You right, Snap?
Mm! You?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.480
Yeah, I'm getting through it.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.240
Hey, I was just thinking
about young Dimma's board.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.040
Yeah, I'm working
on a single concave

07:08.040 --> 07:09.880
to make it run a little faster.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.240
Sounds cool.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.720
Yeah, might get a little confusing,
though,

07:13.720 --> 07:17.560
people thinking you're saving all
those good ideas for your own boards.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.120
What are you saying, Snap?

07:20.120 --> 07:21.920
(CHUCKLES)

07:21.920 --> 07:24.840
Look at you! What do you think,
I'm trying to fleece ya?

07:24.840 --> 07:27.120
Mate, I'm offering you a cut.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.280
I wanna make you a partner.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.720
50%.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.480
Of every board?

07:34.480 --> 07:37.280
Well, every board
that goes out the door, sure.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.360
I'll carry the costs,

07:39.360 --> 07:41.800
and you can take your cut.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.360
Build yourself an empire,

07:44.360 --> 07:45.960
like everybody else.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.160
My name on the board?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.840
No.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.040
While you're in my shop,
they're Bare Feet boards.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.560
Let me think about it.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.360
Of course.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.880
DANI: So you're really moving here?
TASH: Yeah.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.480
Once you see it you'll want to too.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.600
And you're gonna love Vic.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.440
What about my shop?

08:23.440 --> 08:26.160
Well...ownership is patriarchal.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.400
Oh.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.000
This community is about
living outside of all of that.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.840
Sharing, bartering,
working collectively.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.600
I'm not asking you
to give up on your dream,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.600
just meet them.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.760
Little bit asking me
to give up on my dream.

Hi.
Ah, Tash!

09:02.240 --> 09:04.600
This is Vic.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.280
You must be Dani.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.840
Yeah. Hi.
Welcome.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.720
Oh. Thank you.
(CHUCKLES)

09:09.720 --> 09:11.360
Ooh, what are those muscles?
(CHUCKLES)

09:11.360 --> 09:12.680
She's a surfer.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.080
Ah!
Yeah, a pretty good one.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.600
Oh!

09:17.640 --> 09:19.320
So...

09:19.320 --> 09:21.560
..you don't think
all that mastering of the oceans

09:21.560 --> 09:24.280
is part
of the patri-centric paradigm?

09:24.280 --> 09:27.400
You know, the need to conquer
Mother Nature and tame her?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.160
Trust me, I don't tame anything.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.840
(CHUCKLES)
Maybe I'm not that good of a surfer.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.480
Come on through.
I'll show you around.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.080
This is Dani.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.320
Hi!
Hello.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.160
Welcome.
Oh, welcome.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.280
Hey.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.760
Isn't it amazing?
Yeah.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.520
Power of the collective.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.800
Oh, so you guys
built all this yourself?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.840
Blood, sweat and a few too many
tears, to be honest with you,

09:51.840 --> 09:54.640
but if you tell anybody I said that,
I'll have to kill you.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.160
You know,
I could borrow my dad's power saw

09:57.160 --> 09:59.120
and we could get a proper house up
here in no time...

09:59.120 --> 10:01.560
Uh... No meat, no men, no machines.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.360
The power tool's male?

10:04.360 --> 10:07.480
We want to stay in tune with
Mother Nature, not vanquish her.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.680
Also, to get electricity out here,
we'd have to get men onto the land,

10:10.680 --> 10:13.480
and we're sheltering quite a few
bruised and battered women

10:13.480 --> 10:15.160
who are trying to heal.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.120
It's more a basic necessity
than a rule.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.680
Yeah, I cannot wait
for you to see this bit.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.000
Holy shit!

10:26.000 --> 10:27.440
Yeah.
What?

10:27.440 --> 10:29.800
We've been looking for this break
for years.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.480
Oh, wait till I tell Reg
that we found Ghosties!

10:32.480 --> 10:34.280
No, you can't surf it, Dani.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.600
Oh, watch me.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.840
No, she means you're not allowed.
We leave the Mother in peace.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.680
I just thought you'd like to see it.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.960
You realise this is killing me?

10:44.960 --> 10:46.680
Change always comes with sacrifice.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.760
Dolphins surf too, you know?

11:03.160 --> 11:06.360
(WAVES CRASH)

11:11.520 --> 11:14.200
That's good, Karen.
Confident lines.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.440
Thanks, Miss.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.480
Have you talked to Tania lately?

11:18.480 --> 11:20.200
Yeah. A bit.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.040
The universe gave us this gift.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.520
(SHOUTS) Thank you, universe!

23:59.520 --> 24:01.680
(CHUCKLES) You're very quiet,
S Kwong.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.880
I'm...reassessing.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.680
Yeah, see, you're an artist,
S Kwong.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.680
You're gonna take all this

24:07.680 --> 24:09.520
and you're gonna create
the kind of dream

24:09.520 --> 24:11.120
that's gonna keep men up at night

24:11.120 --> 24:13.840
wondering why they wasted their
whole lives chasing an illusion.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.400
Fuck, yeah!

24:15.400 --> 24:17.840
We have perfect equilibrium here.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.560
In harmony with everything.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.800
The tides.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.960
The sun. The moon.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.320
Even the sharks.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.040
We have it all.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.120
Come on, smile, Mama.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.920
Look where you are.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.120
(WAVES CRASH)

24:37.800 --> 24:39.560
REGGIE: And this
is where I do all the board-shaping,

24:39.560 --> 24:41.040
down at this shed.
SYLVIE: Ah-huh!

24:41.040 --> 24:42.560
Yep.
They make all the wetsuits in there.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.160
George?
That's where they do the wetsuits.

24:44.160 --> 24:47.160
And, so, I've been trying out
some new ideas.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.960
Twin fin.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.720
You know, keel fin.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.160
Oh.
Uh... Harder rails.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.960
You know,
boards are getting shorter,

24:54.960 --> 24:58.000
but there's less drag
'cause of this new fin set-up.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.160
These boards are really gonna fly.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.560
What's the smell?

25:01.560 --> 25:03.240
Fibreglass.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.400
You get used to it.
Mm.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.440
Bit like your old bedroom, Reg.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.960
(LAUGHS)

25:08.960 --> 25:10.560
Where do you sleep, love?

25:10.560 --> 25:12.480
I'm alright. I go up to the shed.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.840
(CLATTERS)
Oh.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.920
You're warm enough?
Sylvie, he's a grown man,

25:17.920 --> 25:19.920
he can look after
his own sleeping arrangements.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.160
Of course.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.320
Anyways...this is it.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.600
Have you got an invoice pad?

25:32.520 --> 25:34.520
Not yet.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.160
Well, it's not much point
setting up a business

25:36.160 --> 25:38.040
if you don't
have your paperwork in place.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.880
Your mum
does a very good job of mine.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.600
We've got an invoice pad
we could give him?

25:41.600 --> 25:43.160
Yeah, course we do.

25:43.160 --> 25:47.640
Maybe that old filing cabinet,
the one in the shed there.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.240
The deputy and I
have had a long discussion.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.120
The school has very strict policies

25:53.120 --> 25:55.320
with regards
to talking about private matters.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.440
I respect that.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.960
If a teacher
is found having a conversation

25:58.960 --> 26:00.720
outside of those parameters,

26:00.720 --> 26:03.160
the consequences are serious.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.680
As they should be...
MR COLSTON: Oh, come on, Tracy.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.840
The whole school's been talking
about how you told your students

26:07.840 --> 26:09.760
how to give someone a blowjob.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.840
Only the ones who didn't come to you
for personal demonstration first.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.200
Mrs Dwyer.
See what I mean?

26:14.200 --> 26:18.480
So, you admit that you spoke to your
students about sexual relationships?

26:19.480 --> 26:22.760
I gave them the facts about fucking,
so, yes.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.640
Well, I never.
Wow.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.960
You do realise I'm going to have to
report this to the Department,

26:27.960 --> 26:31.000
and you will be suspended until
we can have a full investigation?

26:33.400 --> 26:35.360
No need for that.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.360
I quit.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.480
Uh... Mrs Dwyer,
we're not finished here.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.280
You're wrong there.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.200
Relax, mate.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.920
This is the easy part.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.720
MR ZEMENIK: You want to send me
to an early grave?

27:55.720 --> 27:57.720
I told you there's no more rubber.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.680
OK, but I wanna
be in the wetsuit business,

27:59.680 --> 28:01.160
and I need a guaranteed supply.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.840
Well, you don't always get
what you want.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.360
I thought you'd know that by now.

28:04.360 --> 28:07.240
My whole business is based on advice
you gave me when I worked here.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.960
Exactly.
You stay loyal to your customers.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.440
That's the most important thing.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.560
And I'm the one
who set up Snapper's deal,

28:12.560 --> 28:15.200
so I know that his profit margins
have increased

28:15.200 --> 28:18.360
to more than 10 times what
he's paying you for that rubber.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.360
I'll double the wholesale price.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.720
And I'll guarantee you a number
that's indexed on the sale price

28:23.720 --> 28:26.400
of every wetsuit Lightwave makes.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.360
OK, three times wholesale.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.240
Where are you getting
this money from?

28:35.240 --> 28:37.160
I told you.
We licensed the brand in the US.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.960
So now you have more money
than sense.

28:39.960 --> 28:43.200
Probably. But it's MY money.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.520
And what about my daughter?

28:46.520 --> 28:49.240
The bigger we get,
the better it is for Jules.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.440
Then she's never going to come home.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.560
Her mother cries every day.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.240
Look, I have as much control
over what she does as you do.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.640
Less.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.960
Yeah, it's...it's Dani's shop,

but I'm excited to have someplace
for my clothes, finally.

Yeah, I'm sorry, mate, but I really
need that dough, Newbie.

When do you think I can get it?
We're on it.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.040
I already told you that, Trotter.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.480
You were on it months ago.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.920

I promise, OK?

30:14.920 --> 30:17.320
It's not a problem.
I'll wire it to you directly.

who wanted this deal.

Thank you.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.400
No, honestly, I cannot...

I can't even be around my parents
for more than a meal,

31:58.120 --> 32:00.560
and I'm already
crawling up the walls.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.280
I'm not always having fun.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.160
I just figure that someone's
gone to the trouble of feeding me

32:05.160 --> 32:07.120
I might as well be polite.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.120
What? What's wrong with that?

32:09.120 --> 32:12.360
What does politeness
even count for anymore?

32:12.360 --> 32:15.960
I mean, really, look at, uh...
look at Wounded Knee.

32:15.960 --> 32:20.520
Now, Nixon is definitely lying
about Watergate.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.840
And don't even get me started
on John Denver.

God, if that guy's not a sign
that society's about to crumble,

32:43.840 --> 32:46.880
I'm broke...Cee Cee.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.960
Your uncle is waiting on his order,

and I can't even begin to tell you

building something out of nothing.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.720
Yeah, certainly feels like that
most days.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.520
I'll talk to my uncle.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.400
He can wait.

rip my dress off and scream.

he liked the class.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.640
You know...

35:05.800 --> 35:08.200
..I never really wanted
to become a teacher.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.040
I applied and got into
Art School that summer.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.760
Dad made me a deal -
if I went to Teachers' College,

35:13.760 --> 35:16.560
he'd let me come back here
for the holidays.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.440
I gave up my spot at Art School
to be with you.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.800
(CHUCKLES)

35:36.520 --> 35:38.080
I didn't know that.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.840
It's what girls did back then.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.840
It's what girls do now.

and knowing you're the guy
who started Bare Feet.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.560
The competition with Lightwave...

36:03.560 --> 36:05.000
I never asked for that.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.200
Ah, true.

did he?

36:17.880 --> 36:19.360
Cheeky.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.760
Give us three. Thanks.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.560
Say, you don't want to, um...

36:25.560 --> 36:28.040
..wanna join me for a coldie?

36:34.600 --> 36:37.080
Snap.
Mm?

36:37.080 --> 36:39.520
Would you have bought Dumbo?

36:44.400 --> 36:46.240
(CHUCKLES)

36:55.440 --> 36:58.480
TROTTER: Well, I worked for him for
three years. He had to do me a deal.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.160
Did this Trotter wear a tie?

37:00.160 --> 37:01.960
Mm, every day.
Oof.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.960
And slacks.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.080
(LAUGHS)

37:05.080 --> 37:06.800
Never again, though.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.960
You're still a salesman, though.
But now you sell a dream.

37:09.960 --> 37:12.080
And a bloody good product,
don't forget.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.080
True.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.880
You know, my old man
was a travelling salesman.

37:15.880 --> 37:19.360
Yeah, he went door-to-door.
The hard way.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.600
Selling everything from...

37:21.600 --> 37:24.000
..fabric, buttons

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
to everyone from
suburban mums to farmers' wives.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.200
No-one ever expected
anything more from me than that.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.680
But...

37:32.680 --> 37:35.200
..first time I stood up on a board,

37:35.200 --> 37:39.080
I felt so free, I could...taste it.

37:39.080 --> 37:42.240
It was like I saw a way
for my life to be different.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.400
And now?
And now I'm my own man.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.440
With staff and bills
and obligations.

37:47.440 --> 37:50.960
Yeah, but I live by the beach,
I don't work for anyone else.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.480
And, yet, here you are,
running around the city,

37:53.480 --> 37:55.240
buying up all of Snapper's rubber.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.280
It's not his.

37:59.160 --> 38:03.600
Does it ever feel to you like that
beach in Bali was a lifetime ago?

38:04.600 --> 38:06.960
I remember that night you told me
you were a small-town girl,

38:06.960 --> 38:08.880
which I still don't believe.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.920
You speak three language,
for Christ's sake.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.640
I grew up on the border.
It's normal.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.560
For you.
My home town was small.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.400
I think I was on that beach in Bali
'cause...

38:18.400 --> 38:21.040
..I wanted to be as far away from it
as I could get.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.560
You're an adventurer.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.520
So are you.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.080
Do you remember what you said to me
that night?

38:28.080 --> 38:29.520
I was high.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.520
And?

38:31.520 --> 38:34.000
And I wanted a summer
that never ends.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.320
Never ends.

38:35.320 --> 38:38.440
And you were gonna visit every beach
in all of them.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.360
I still want that.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.000
And Tracy -
you didn't tell me about her.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.360
You didn't ask.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.360
Sometimes I wish I had.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.120
Are you happy, Trotter?

38:57.200 --> 39:00.800
What about you and Sharpie?
Are you happy with your choice?

39:01.800 --> 39:03.280
I hope so.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.240
You ever wonder
if it could have worked between us?

39:08.240 --> 39:10.240
You want a wife.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.760
I'm not that.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.480
You know, sometimes I...

39:16.480 --> 39:18.400
..wonder...

39:20.920 --> 39:23.360
..what it would have been like...

39:24.360 --> 39:26.120
..to not.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.520
When I'm away,

39:31.520 --> 39:35.920
I sometimes imagine
that I'm in a bubble.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.440
Like us here tonight.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.800
No-one knows who we are.

39:40.800 --> 39:44.000
No-one's asking questions.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.360
Like this table.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.440
Tomorrow a new cloth.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.160
Tonight's dinner gone.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.480
Everything just like it was before.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.560
We could do anything tonight.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.640
And tomorrow...

39:59.640 --> 40:02.120
..it would be
as if it never happened.
