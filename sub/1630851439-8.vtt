WEBVTT

02:26.396 --> 02:27.814
Ilex!

02:35.030 --> 02:37.407
After they were gone,
there were no children left.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.785
Only warriors.

02:40.661 --> 02:45.374
I pushed this scarred body of mine till
I was named the Grand Huntress of War.

02:47.751 --> 02:51.672
I outlived my life's expectancy
three times over.

02:51.755 --> 02:56.009
The Weald Gods wouldn't let me die
till I got my revenge.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.471
And when I was ready…

03:01.306 --> 03:03.058
they sent me a second gift.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.560
The Invictus?

03:04.643 --> 03:06.895
It blinked into orbit like a prayer.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.439
And I knew then,

03:09.523 --> 03:13.151
the gods did not just approve of
my mission to destroy the Empire,

03:13.861 --> 03:14.903
they engineered it.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.905
You saw what happened to your people.

03:18.740 --> 03:23.912
For the sins of a few,
the Empire wiped out half your world.

03:24.496 --> 03:28.500
If you strike at Trantor,
the entire Outer Reach will suffer.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.961
You simply have no concept of revenge,
do you?

03:32.504 --> 03:34.423
I don't care about mankind.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.220
This ship is going to be my voice.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.308
You will help me navigate its next jump.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.270
And if you don't,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.732
my hunters will kill every man,

03:52.816 --> 03:57.571
woman and child left on Terminus,

03:57.654 --> 03:59.156
starting with your mother.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.288
You already sacrificed your father.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.458
You wouldn't sacrifice her as well.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.545
The trade-off is simple, Warden.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.091
Destroy Trantor…

04:19.301 --> 04:23.347
and maybe, just maybe,

04:24.348 --> 04:27.809
your precious Foundation survives
what comes after.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.649
Isn't it remarkable
what a person will do for a little time?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.846
How long have you been able to do this?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.057
As long as I can remember.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.770
Most of the time it's just a feeling.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.231
Like with this, but…

05:16.358 --> 05:18.277
other times it comes in dreams.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.447
I used to dream about a wave.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.117
A wave so big…

05:25.742 --> 05:30.956
all I could do was hold my breath
and let it take me.

05:32.332 --> 05:37.880
I knew it would crush my home,
my family, my whole world.

05:39.965 --> 05:43.010
I could never get rid of that dream, Hari.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.221
It haunted me.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.308
I needed to know that
it wasn't going to happen in real life,

05:49.391 --> 05:52.311
so I taught myself math.

05:52.394 --> 05:56.315
I calculated every probability
and physical force I could think of,

05:56.398 --> 05:58.066
desperate to see a way around it.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.405
But I couldn't find one.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.743
That dream drove you to mathematics,

06:07.826 --> 06:11.038
which only proved it wasn't
a dream at all, but a premonition.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.415
I wouldn't be surprised to learn

06:13.498 --> 06:16.376
that you have some sort of
intuitive processing ability

06:16.460 --> 06:17.920
that puts you ahead of the math.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.130
It would explain Abraxas.

06:21.757 --> 06:25.093
I solved Abraxas
because I worked my ass off.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.971
Yes, I'm saying you're extraordinary.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.812
It's getting hotter.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.065
Friction as we enter the debris field.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.692
The ship's radiators
will bleed off the heat.

06:40.776 --> 06:44.655
Initiating heat transfer system.
Stabilizing.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.907
Why are you going to Helicon, Hari?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.909
What were you and Raych planning?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.953
I've already told you.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.829
No, I made a supposition
which you didn't deny.

06:52.913 --> 06:53.956
Because you were right.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.917
Are you really going to continue
keeping me in the dark?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.503
One could argue
I should've done so from the beginning.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.213
What's that supposed to mean?

07:01.713 --> 07:02.840
If we're not careful,

07:02.923 --> 07:07.553
this prescience of yours has the potential
to skew psychohistory completely.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.555
Look what happened to you and Raych.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.056
You're here, he's not.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.102
That didn't come out right.
Let me take that back.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.145
What I'm trying to say

07:17.229 --> 07:21.441
is that mankind's survival
is predicated on us reaching Helicon.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.528
I thought our survival
depended on the Foundation.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.321
It is, to an extent.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.787
But only if its sister organization is
established as well.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.914
So it is a second Foundation.

07:35.998 --> 07:40.294
Here, at Star's End. On Helicon.

08:48.737 --> 08:49.738
This is Hugo Crast--

08:51.990 --> 08:53.075
This is Cian un Edan,

08:54.493 --> 08:56.620
former citizen of Thespis,

08:58.163 --> 09:01.708
sending an SOS to the Thespin Republic.

09:02.668 --> 09:06.880
Anacreon activity to report at outpost 59.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.093
Does anyone read me?

09:13.011 --> 09:14.513
Does anyone read me?

09:18.141 --> 09:19.268
Does anyone read me?

09:59.641 --> 10:03.645
The Spiral is designed to push
the body to the limits of its endurance.

10:03.729 --> 10:09.234
A trek of over 170 kilometers
with no food, no water and no rest.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.028
Vital signs are optimal.

10:13.572 --> 10:17.159
And, of course, you must leave
any inorganic devices behind.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.036
Your protective aura…

10:31.131 --> 10:32.591
and your imperial nanobots.

10:36.845 --> 10:40.390
For the first time in your life,
you will be subject to injury,

10:41.099 --> 10:43.060
-exhaustion--
-I understand.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.937
In the event that a pilgrim falters,

10:45.020 --> 10:47.564
he may receive help
from another person on the path.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.234
That is,
if he has only fallen to one knee.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.821
If both knees should drop,
this is a signal of submission.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.451
The pilgrim must either find
the strength to crawl away from the path,

10:59.535 --> 11:01.578
or he must yield to death.

11:03.497 --> 11:07.251
Less than half of those who start
will reach the center of the Spiral.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.754
There, they will enter a sacred cave,
the Mother's Womb.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.173
There is water inside the Womb.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.677
The salt around the pool has
a particular ionic charge

11:16.760 --> 11:20.472
which elicits a singular reaction
in anyone who touches it.

11:20.556 --> 11:26.144
After you immerse yourself in the pool,
if the Mother is willing,

11:26.770 --> 11:28.438
you will be graced with a vision.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.275
If you're successful and you return,

11:31.942 --> 11:34.862
a panel of Zephyrs will interpret
what you have seen.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.446
What have other pilgrims seen?

11:36.947 --> 11:39.700
Every vision is unique
and deeply personal.

11:40.284 --> 11:42.995
I'm surprised they're not
all just hallucinating about food.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.831
Nanobot removal complete.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.336
This gambit will put you at serious risk,
Empire.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.548
In addition
to unprecedented physical danger,

11:54.631 --> 11:56.008
if--

11:56.091 --> 11:58.093
if you're unable to make it to the end,

11:58.177 --> 12:00.345
that will only embolden your critics.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.306
I will make it to the end.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.270
Give me your salt bracelet.

12:26.788 --> 12:27.998
I'm taking this.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.294
It'll be as though
you're right there with me.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.297
As you always have been.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.441
In faith. Take it slow.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.153
These middle rings can be deceptive.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.031
Make us think
we're further along than we are.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.451
Just be sure you've got
some fuel left in the tank.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.203
Done this before?

13:48.912 --> 13:52.457
No, no. But I've talked
to a number of people who have.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.006
Any other useful tips to impart?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.176
There's no way to make it easy.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.219
That's kind of the point.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.513
Just pace yourself.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.224
One foot in front of the other.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.727
The Triple Goddess will guide you.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.857
Did these people talk about their visions?

14:21.445 --> 14:24.114
One pilgrim did tell me

14:24.198 --> 14:29.536
how the salt around the pool started
to swirl and shift right before her eyes.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.289
She didn't say what happened next,

14:32.372 --> 14:35.292
but she said it was
the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.092
-Where are you from?
-Baltaros. You?

14:44.176 --> 14:47.513
-Nishaya.
-The manufacturing planet.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.850
Whatever's too toxic to make
right on Trantor, that's what we do.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.436
Speciality textiles.

14:54.978 --> 14:58.357
Certain kinds of ceramic glazes
the Empire favors.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.193
Nishaya's the perfect place,

15:01.276 --> 15:04.029
because our atmosphere is
all this thick white fog,

15:04.112 --> 15:08.200
and, well,
the pollution just sort of blends.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.245
That fog.

15:11.870 --> 15:12.871
My mother used to say

15:12.955 --> 15:15.791
that by the time she finally got
her first good look at my dad's face…

15:16.458 --> 15:18.168
they'd already had three kids together.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.631
Did you work in one of these factories?

15:22.714 --> 15:24.800
No. I was a loader.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.219
Loading boxes onto jumpships.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.099
Magnificent machines, aren't they?

15:32.182 --> 15:33.183
Oh, sure.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.353
Of course, I'd never actually been
on one till I came here.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.231
Used all my savings to book my passage.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.194
From Baltaros?
You must have taken one as well.

15:44.278 --> 15:45.279
Yes.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.032
Also my first time.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.829
I used to be jealous of people
who got to travel all the time,

15:53.912 --> 15:56.039
jumping from
one end of the galaxy to the next.

15:56.623 --> 16:01.461
But this… this is the only journey
I ever really needed to make.

16:03.505 --> 16:04.840
I hope you feel the same.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.635
A second Foundation?

16:08.719 --> 16:11.638
Terminus was established
via Imperial charter

16:11.722 --> 16:14.766
and was, in part, designed to draw fire.

16:15.350 --> 16:19.354
But the Second Foundation
and its location must be kept secret,

16:20.898 --> 16:22.566
even from the first Foundation.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.027
Why? What's its purpose?

16:28.113 --> 16:31.325
If you're not willing to trust me,
then I am not going to Helicon.

16:32.284 --> 16:33.702
Don't be ridiculous, Gaal.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.997
I have resources on Helicon. Allies.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.958
Now that we know the nature
of your abilities, we could study them.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.418
Use them to our advantage.

16:41.502 --> 16:44.129
I am done being used.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.841
I want off. Now.

16:47.925 --> 16:51.929
Either you tell me,
or I will leave the same way I came.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.185
Where will you go?

16:58.268 --> 17:00.354
Terminus will take decades.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.689
Trantor? You'll be banished by the Empire.

17:02.773 --> 17:05.442
There are more worlds than that.
My mother taught me their names.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.949
You told me my instincts are important.

17:12.491 --> 17:14.201
Well, they're telling me.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.328
Open the goddamn door.

17:16.411 --> 17:20.374
-You're not thinking clearly.
-Don't tell me what I think.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.959
Open it.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.298
Open it!

17:29.633 --> 17:30.676
Open!

17:33.470 --> 17:35.055
Open the door!

18:42.080 --> 18:45.167
Don't give up yet, son.
We're getting close.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.137
Yes.

19:05.938 --> 19:10.025
Thirty--
No, 29 minutes till the next jump.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.657
Her plan--

19:18.075 --> 19:19.535
Even if you succeed,

19:21.411 --> 19:23.747
the Empire will slaughter
the rest of your people.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.500
And it won't be a half measure this time.

19:28.544 --> 19:29.711
They'll kill everyone.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.257
And in the chaos that follows…

19:35.425 --> 19:36.718
they'll all be forgotten.

19:38.887 --> 19:42.558
I know Phara sees herself as a hand
reaching out of Anacreon's grave…

19:44.893 --> 19:47.479
but Anacreon children are
still being born today.

19:52.401 --> 19:53.986
You have a child of your own, don't you?

19:56.154 --> 19:57.281
A little girl.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.952
-It feels like a little girl.
-How are you doing this?

20:02.035 --> 20:04.454
Phara didn't tell you?
People are open books to me.

20:06.665 --> 20:09.251
All I read in her was darkness.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.545
But I read doubt inside you.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.674
There's still a path forward for Anacreon.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.468
Isn't that a better way
to pay back all the dead?

20:19.678 --> 20:22.055
-Take cover!
-Jacenta?

20:26.602 --> 20:27.603
Damn this ship.

20:28.729 --> 20:29.938
Rowan.

20:44.912 --> 20:45.913
This was a mutiny.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.083
The officers must have positioned
the gun to guard the bridge.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.134
You.

20:59.218 --> 21:00.969
You're gonna draw its fire
while I disable it.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.054
What if you miss?

21:02.679 --> 21:03.722
Then you'll die.

21:24.743 --> 21:25.911
Time's running out, Warden.

22:07.703 --> 22:11.331
-Lucky shot.
-You do luck, I do skill.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.166
Another barrier.

22:15.586 --> 22:16.753
You know the drill.

22:43.822 --> 22:45.490
-Get down!
-Lewis!

22:55.959 --> 22:57.419
Come on.

22:57.503 --> 22:59.421
Won't take them long
to get through those doors.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.640
Override the door.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.314
We're running out of time!

23:47.302 --> 23:48.428
Captain killed herself.

23:50.472 --> 23:51.682
"Exo."

23:52.808 --> 23:55.727
Like, executive officer?

23:55.811 --> 23:58.522
Was she betrayed by someone
in her command?

23:58.605 --> 24:01.024
Exo also means "from outside."

24:01.900 --> 24:03.151
Outside the galaxy?

24:05.279 --> 24:07.281
You think they encountered something
out there?

24:16.123 --> 24:17.583
Individual work pods.

24:20.169 --> 24:21.503
One of these controls navigation.

24:23.130 --> 24:27.050
If we can find it, we have a shot
at redirecting the next jump.

24:27.134 --> 24:28.135
Weapons?

24:28.969 --> 24:30.179
Not a weapon.

24:31.096 --> 24:32.389
Propulsion.

24:33.182 --> 24:35.309
They must have jumped
too far away to resupply.

24:36.852 --> 24:39.771
Just started jumping farther out
and farther out.

24:39.855 --> 24:43.317
Warning.
Trans-spatial event in 20 minutes.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.904
Initiate transit protocols.

24:46.987 --> 24:47.988
Now I get it.

24:48.071 --> 24:49.990
What, the lights are what?
Transit protocols?

24:50.073 --> 24:51.825
This ship doesn't have any Spacers.

24:51.909 --> 24:55.913
Without them, the crew members must have
had to sedate themselves before the jump.

24:56.413 --> 24:59.374
The lights told them
how long they had to reach a jump cradle.

24:59.458 --> 25:00.459
We're running out of time.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.544
Over there.

25:10.969 --> 25:13.680
This is it. The navigation cradle.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.099
Before the Empire had Spacers,

25:16.183 --> 25:19.186
these older ships needed something
with massive processing power

25:19.269 --> 25:20.562
to navigate their jumps.

25:20.646 --> 25:24.191
See, folding space is
as much intuition as it is science.

25:25.651 --> 25:27.069
It's like making a wish.

25:27.152 --> 25:31.073
A cognitive leap that only
a living brain can perform.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.116
The difference is,

25:33.200 --> 25:35.786
Spacers were genetically engineered
to withstand the strain,

25:35.869 --> 25:39.790
but these unaugmented humans,
they didn't have that advantage.

25:42.209 --> 25:43.377
In order to survive…

25:46.421 --> 25:51.260
they had to be hardwired
directly into the ships.

25:54.096 --> 25:56.723
He was shot.
The ship was searching for him.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.477
Unable to navigate on its own.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.404
Could someone jack in without the surgery?

26:13.532 --> 26:14.825
If the AI's intuitive,

26:16.368 --> 26:18.453
wouldn't the interface seek out
the right neurons?

26:18.537 --> 26:22.374
Oh, yes. Maybe.
But they wouldn't survive for long.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.044
Long enough to control the jump?

26:29.923 --> 26:31.592
To make sure the Foundation survives?

26:31.675 --> 26:33.594
A single jump into empty space?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.974
Maybe, but…

26:39.057 --> 26:40.559
it would be a death sentence.

26:42.811 --> 26:44.897
Well, if one of us
is gonna sacrifice ourselves,

26:44.980 --> 26:46.398
it might as well be the outlier.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.150
Help me figure out how.

26:51.612 --> 26:53.113
But not to empty space.

26:55.866 --> 26:57.784
I'm gonna take this ship home to Terminus.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.913
This one wants to speak to you,
Lieutenant.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.293
-Lieutenant Freestone, we have a problem.
-That thing out there?

27:48.377 --> 27:50.337
We call it the Vault.
We don't know what it is,

27:50.420 --> 27:52.965
just that it's surrounded
by a signal field that makes people sick.

27:53.048 --> 27:55.175
You start seeing double
and eventually go unconscious.

27:55.801 --> 27:59.012
Your Huntress experienced its effects.

27:59.096 --> 28:01.014
That's how my daughter
was able to capture her.

28:01.098 --> 28:02.432
We don't know the long-term effect,

28:02.516 --> 28:05.644
but the field surrounding it
is getting larger.

28:05.727 --> 28:06.937
We have to evacuate.

28:08.564 --> 28:09.773
This isn't a trick.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.610
The null field doesn't give a damn
what planet you're from.

28:13.694 --> 28:16.405
If we don't act,
it's going to overtake us all.

28:16.989 --> 28:18.740
You have to let the fence down.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.106
The Mother calls to me.

28:51.190 --> 28:54.651
-No. You still have strength.
-No.

29:07.873 --> 29:11.460
Let me at least help you off the path,
and they can tend to you.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.222
You can't just die here.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.266
How could I choose to die anywhere else?

29:27.684 --> 29:29.102
A peaceful transition.

29:30.312 --> 29:32.397
That is the Mother's greatest gift…

29:34.274 --> 29:35.567
into a holier life.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.570
What if there is no other life?

29:39.571 --> 29:43.450
What if this is just the end?

29:53.669 --> 29:55.170
Maybe we'll meet again.

29:57.297 --> 29:59.299
You can tell me what you saw.

33:17.873 --> 33:24.755
You stand before representatives
of the Mother, the Maiden and the Crone.

33:25.923 --> 33:29.468
All who walk the Spiral are beloved to us.

33:30.135 --> 33:34.973
Tell us,
what did you experience inside the Womb?

33:36.767 --> 33:38.435
As I stood there…

33:41.146 --> 33:42.814
the salt began to move.

33:44.525 --> 33:46.818
And it began to swirl.

33:46.902 --> 33:50.864
Slowly at first, then faster.

33:53.033 --> 33:55.244
It lifted from the floor of the cave.

33:59.498 --> 34:02.167
It took the form of a stem…

34:05.212 --> 34:07.130
with three large petals.

34:11.176 --> 34:13.469
I worried that I was imagining it.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.889
But it was real.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.029
Are you familiar with mythology
of the birthroot flower?

34:34.908 --> 34:36.243
No.

34:38.786 --> 34:42.708
After Dol collided into Surah
and created the triple moons,

34:42.791 --> 34:45.252
the maiden was covered
in a blanket of birthroots.

34:45.335 --> 34:50.257
This was a sign from the Triple Goddess
that our world could sustain life.

34:50.340 --> 34:53.802
Over the centuries,
the flowers gradually died off.

34:53.886 --> 34:57.806
We have not seen them here
for thousands of years.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.391
What does it mean?

34:59.474 --> 35:04.313
By their nature, three-petaled flowers
germinate from monocot seedlings.

35:04.396 --> 35:09.318
In other words,
three elements created out of one.

35:09.401 --> 35:11.320
Just like my brothers and I.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.906
And the Triple Goddess as well.

35:13.989 --> 35:16.742
This is a holy vision, Empire.

35:17.993 --> 35:20.996
In fact, your very presence here is holy,

35:21.538 --> 35:25.042
a journey none
of your predecessors ever dared to make.

35:25.584 --> 35:30.005
Yours is clearly not
a soul mired in stagnation.

35:32.424 --> 35:37.137
Anyone who says that it is
would be guilty of sin themselves,

35:37.221 --> 35:43.519
of attempting to bar a seeking soul
from the path of enlightenment.

35:43.602 --> 35:48.315
From this day forth,
no other zephyr will stand in your way.

36:22.266 --> 36:23.767
You're wasting your strength.

36:25.394 --> 36:28.856
Better you rest until we're through the
debris field than risk heat exhaustion.

36:32.359 --> 36:33.944
What's the current temperature?

36:34.444 --> 36:37.406
38 degrees. Should peak around 41.

36:39.241 --> 36:40.659
And if it isn't the peak?

36:46.123 --> 36:47.207
What are you up to?

36:48.667 --> 36:51.712
Shut up. Just shut up.

36:52.671 --> 36:53.672
Gaal.

36:53.755 --> 36:55.507
Reaching critical temperature.

36:55.591 --> 36:58.010
Initializing heat transfer system.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.721
-Gaal.
-Stabilizing.

37:00.804 --> 37:02.514
No more half-truths.

37:03.015 --> 37:05.976
Tell me everything,
or I'm ending the journey now.

37:06.059 --> 37:07.227
I mean it, Hari.

37:07.311 --> 37:09.855
If I do,
I risk destroying the Second Foundation

37:09.938 --> 37:11.356
before it's even been created.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.026
-Tell me!
-You have no idea what you're--

37:14.109 --> 37:17.946
-Stop! Stop! Stop!
-I don't care anymore!

37:32.419 --> 37:33.629
What have you done?

37:36.131 --> 37:37.633
Without the heat transfer system,

37:37.716 --> 37:41.178
I'll be boiled alive
long before you reach Helicon.

37:42.012 --> 37:44.515
They say information can't be destroyed.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.266
So maybe you'll survive.

37:48.268 --> 37:49.728
But I certainly won't.

37:59.905 --> 38:01.573
What's it gonna be, Hari?

38:02.991 --> 38:07.496
Either watch me burn to death
or let me go free.

38:15.254 --> 38:19.299
You realize I could just program
the cryopod to go where I want it to go?

38:19.383 --> 38:22.928
You don't need me, Hari. You never did.

38:23.011 --> 38:24.012
Not true.

38:24.096 --> 38:25.264
It is.

38:26.306 --> 38:29.893
My story was supposed to end on Terminus.
You said it yourself.

38:30.394 --> 38:34.064
You and Raych always intended
on leaving me behind so…

38:36.149 --> 38:37.276
Just let me go.

38:39.403 --> 38:40.404
Please.

39:07.431 --> 39:08.682
Bye, Hari.

39:09.933 --> 39:11.143
Goodbye, Gaal.

39:52.059 --> 39:53.727
Awaiting destination.

39:56.688 --> 39:59.316
Calculate journey to the Blue Drift.

39:59.399 --> 40:00.651
To Synnax.

40:02.069 --> 40:05.906
Duration, 138 imperial standard years.

40:12.621 --> 40:14.122
Confirm destination.

40:21.129 --> 40:25.259
86,982,041.

40:27.094 --> 40:31.723
86,982,043.

40:33.350 --> 40:38.188
86,982,061…

41:26.904 --> 41:28.071
Zephyr Halima.

41:31.825 --> 41:35.954
Thank you for inspiring me to take
this journey of transformation.

41:38.373 --> 41:40.375
If I hadn't attended your eulogy,

41:41.627 --> 41:46.590
I never would have summoned
the courage to attempt the Spiral.

41:57.935 --> 42:01.104
Triple blessings to you, Empire.

42:03.524 --> 42:04.691
And to you.

42:39.351 --> 42:41.979
Please, come in.

42:43.856 --> 42:45.148
All are welcome.

42:47.401 --> 42:49.194
I wanted to express my condolences.

42:50.237 --> 42:52.531
You would have made a compelling proxima.

42:52.614 --> 42:53.782
Yes.

42:55.242 --> 42:57.703
I think that's what Cleon was afraid of.

42:59.663 --> 43:02.291
In any case, he got what he wanted.

43:04.751 --> 43:11.300
Zephyr Gilat will be named,
and, well, I'll return to my home planet.

43:17.139 --> 43:18.849
Are you not happy with the outcome?

43:20.434 --> 43:24.021
I just assumed you coached
the Emperor's performance.

43:24.104 --> 43:26.690
No, I did not.

43:27.274 --> 43:31.653
And I assure you,
my happiness is of no importance.

43:32.487 --> 43:33.530
I disagree.

43:36.200 --> 43:43.040
Look, I know people use reincarnation
as an excuse to ignore their instincts,

43:43.540 --> 43:46.502
to throw every opportunity
for happiness away.

43:46.585 --> 43:51.882
But if you do that,
how can you ever really grow?

43:51.965 --> 43:53.425
This is not about my growth.

43:53.509 --> 43:58.222
If you don't support him anymore,
you can find another path.

43:58.305 --> 43:59.431
That's not possible.

43:59.515 --> 44:01.183
Of course it is. You're not a prisoner.

44:01.266 --> 44:02.976
You don't understand.
I do not have a choice.

44:03.060 --> 44:05.896
Everyone has a choice.
Even when it feels like they do not.

44:05.979 --> 44:09.441
I know how it sounds,
but I swear it on the Maiden. I do not.

44:09.525 --> 44:10.692
How can that be?

44:18.075 --> 44:21.245
You once said you walked the Great Spiral.

44:22.621 --> 44:23.622
When was that?

44:28.752 --> 44:30.504
11,000 years ago.

44:37.052 --> 44:39.137
So it's true?

44:40.764 --> 44:46.061
I heard the rumors that Cleon had
the last intelligent robot in the galaxy.

44:48.063 --> 44:50.440
The things you must have seen…

44:50.524 --> 44:53.944
And now you have to stand by that man
and do whatever he--

45:02.828 --> 45:04.204
He sent you here.

45:10.169 --> 45:14.006
I'm not gonna leave this room alive, am I?

45:15.841 --> 45:18.177
That's the only reason
you told me the truth.

45:26.185 --> 45:31.523
Like Empire,
I do not have individuated sentience.

45:33.442 --> 45:36.361
So I too must not be
in the possession of a soul.

45:37.821 --> 45:42.034
If I were,
then perhaps I could disobey his commands.

45:46.288 --> 45:48.457
Are you sure you do not have one?

45:50.209 --> 45:55.005
If I allow you to run from me now,
I couldn't stop myself.

45:56.048 --> 45:59.676
I would still hunt you down.
I would rip you to pieces.

46:08.852 --> 46:10.062
I'm sorry.

46:13.774 --> 46:18.570
I see genuine compassion in your heart.

46:19.154 --> 46:24.284
True remorse. And I can't explain it,

46:25.452 --> 46:28.497
but I know that you have a soul.

46:30.040 --> 46:32.793
But the one who forces you to do this,

46:33.627 --> 46:37.464
who so cruelly tests your faith
and your loyalty,

46:38.674 --> 46:40.342
he is a soulless man.

46:45.097 --> 46:46.473
I forgive you, Demerzel.

46:48.725 --> 46:51.645
Hey, remember your text.

46:54.481 --> 46:57.276
My end does not come now.

46:58.318 --> 46:59.987
I will be reborn.

47:00.571 --> 47:04.575
You were sent to me
not from Cleon but from the Mother.

47:06.368 --> 47:07.828
Do what you must.

47:10.539 --> 47:11.623
As Her will.

47:12.249 --> 47:13.584
As Her will.

47:22.551 --> 47:26.305
Now, how will it happen?

47:26.388 --> 47:28.182
It has already been done.

47:30.726 --> 47:33.645
A poison was secreted
when our skin touched.

47:34.354 --> 47:35.606
You will feel no pain.

47:58.754 --> 48:02.299
Warning.
Trans-spatial event in five minutes.

48:02.382 --> 48:03.675
Prepare for transition.

48:03.759 --> 48:05.260
The ship is preparing to jump!

48:05.886 --> 48:08.889
I can't overwrite
the locking mechanism.

48:08.972 --> 48:10.557
Then get me through some other way.

48:28.909 --> 48:30.202
All right, let's plug me in.

48:30.285 --> 48:32.412
Look, Salvor,
I'm not even sure this is possible.

48:32.496 --> 48:35.541
Jumping into a planet's orbit requires
absolute precision.

48:35.624 --> 48:36.792
Or luck.

48:37.835 --> 48:39.378
Remember who you're dealing with.

48:41.296 --> 48:44.591
It's probably like flipping a coin
over and over, right?

48:46.301 --> 48:48.470
Maybe like flipping it a thousand times.

48:53.517 --> 48:54.560
Let's start flipping.

48:54.643 --> 48:57.396
-You're telling me to kill you.
-Lewis, don't you see?

48:58.689 --> 49:00.232
This is what I was meant to do.

49:01.650 --> 49:04.862
Everything that happened,
it brought me here.

49:07.322 --> 49:09.074
Now this is our only chance.

49:09.157 --> 49:11.076
So I have to try.

49:11.827 --> 49:13.662
We have to try.

49:13.745 --> 49:15.998
And that is all there is in a crisis.

49:17.624 --> 49:18.625
Trying.

49:36.143 --> 49:38.395
If I die, give this to my mother,
would you?

49:43.233 --> 49:44.484
You're something, Salvor.

49:46.445 --> 49:47.988
I wish I'd seen it earlier.

49:48.780 --> 49:49.948
Do it.

49:51.783 --> 49:52.826
Do it.

49:56.788 --> 49:57.873
Lewis?

50:04.004 --> 50:05.005
Kill her!

50:05.088 --> 50:07.549
You're gonna be okay, you hear me?
Just stay with me, Lewis.

50:08.133 --> 50:09.718
Kill the bitch!

50:09.801 --> 50:10.636
Come on.

50:10.719 --> 50:11.637
Flank her!

50:16.975 --> 50:18.936
Hostile craft detected.

50:19.019 --> 50:20.812
Automated defenses engaged.

50:23.649 --> 50:24.650
Thespin Lancers.

50:24.733 --> 50:26.026
You did it, Hugo.

50:26.109 --> 50:28.320
Thirty seconds before trans-spatial event.

50:28.403 --> 50:30.322
Proceed to cryopods immediately.

50:31.156 --> 50:33.492
Stand down, Anacreons.

50:33.575 --> 50:36.828
Surrender the ship
to us immediately or die.

50:37.746 --> 50:39.831
Get as many guns on them as you can!

50:47.548 --> 50:48.423
Fifteen…

50:49.132 --> 50:52.135
fourteen, thirteen…

50:56.557 --> 50:57.933
eleven…

50:58.809 --> 51:02.187
ten, nine…

51:03.063 --> 51:04.439
eight…

51:07.484 --> 51:09.695
six, five…

51:11.822 --> 51:13.115
four…

51:14.157 --> 51:16.702
three, two…

51:17.995 --> 51:19.413
one…

51:23.792 --> 51:24.793
We're jumping.

51:52.196 --> 51:53.197
Well?

51:53.989 --> 51:54.990
It is done.

51:55.908 --> 51:58.327
It will appear
as if she died of natural causes.

51:58.410 --> 52:01.538
Good. Last thing
we want to do is start a holy war.

52:06.210 --> 52:08.337
Do you have something you wish to say?

52:08.420 --> 52:11.423
You'd defeated her. You'd won.

52:11.507 --> 52:15.844
Your lack of understanding
does not obligate me to explain.

52:15.928 --> 52:17.304
No, of course not.

52:17.387 --> 52:19.014
You are Empire.

52:20.224 --> 52:21.683
And you had a holy vision.

52:21.767 --> 52:23.393
That I did.

52:28.607 --> 52:32.277
I have an ancient birthroot flower
pressed and framed on my vanity.

52:32.861 --> 52:35.822
I acquired it
when I myself walked the Spiral.

52:35.906 --> 52:37.616
I brought it with me on this journey.

52:38.283 --> 52:39.493
Is that so?

52:40.327 --> 52:44.373
I just thought you might have seen it when
you came into my room the other night.

52:44.456 --> 52:46.959
No, not that I recall.

52:47.042 --> 52:48.961
Just a happy coincidence, I suppose.

52:49.044 --> 52:50.921
You seeing the same flower.

52:52.130 --> 52:56.301
In any event, I didn't mean to pry.
I know how personal these visions can be.

52:56.385 --> 52:59.638
Though it's many eons ago, what I saw…

53:01.223 --> 53:03.100
changed the way I look at everything.

53:04.226 --> 53:07.104
You had a vision? A robot?

53:07.187 --> 53:11.441
I did. And I am pleased
that you were graced with one as well.

53:13.277 --> 53:14.611
Seeing nothing…

53:17.447 --> 53:19.950
I would not wish that emptiness on anyone.

53:23.620 --> 53:25.122
May your vision give you strength

53:25.205 --> 53:27.875
as we make our journey
back to Trantor, Empire.

53:28.458 --> 53:31.962
I will notify the Spacers
to prepare you for the jump.

54:44.117 --> 54:47.079
Seeing nothing…

54:48.163 --> 54:51.625
I would not wish that emptiness on anyone.
