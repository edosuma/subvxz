00:14.139 --> 00:17.257
I haven't felt this giddy
since Herbie Hunnicutt and I...

00:17.434 --> 00:21.724
...pooled our box tops and sent away
for that decoder ring and periscope.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.355
Why is that? What is this feeling?

00:24.525 --> 00:25.936
You love treasures.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.944
And you don't? Of course you do.
Everyone loves hidden treasures.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.606
Yamashita's gold,
the Oak Island Money Pit.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.491
Hell, even D.B. Cooper...

00:35.661 --> 00:39.200
...which was more of a mystery
and less of a treasure hunt.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.786
That's what you love, the mystery.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.201
"Mystery." You know why?

00:44.378 --> 00:47.246
- Robert Louis Stevenson.
- Yes! Edgar Allan Poe.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.756
"The Gold-Bug." Oh, what a story.
It has everything.

00:50.926 --> 00:54.761
A delirious search for treasure,
the descent into madness...

00:54.930 --> 00:56.887
...along with ciphers...

00:57.724 --> 01:00.558
...bugs, a skull nailed to a tree.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.893
What a yarn.

01:03.063 --> 01:07.023
If he actually has the locations
of the other coins...

01:07.192 --> 01:09.024
...this could be a massive discovery.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.175
Thank you, gentlemen. You may go.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.344
We got what I came for.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.099
Robert Navarro! M.P.D.
Open the door, please.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.015
- Let's go, Bobby. Open up.
- We're here with the super.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.650
We're coming in, you hear?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.816
Guy's constantly got
people coming and going.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.986
- Music all night.
- Sir, if you could step outside.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.247
I ain't waiting outside.
I know the rules. What'd he do?

03:28.417 --> 03:30.784
- It's drugs, right?
- Bedroom's clear.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.170
You find something wrong, tell me.
That's how it works.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.002
86-37 to Central,
domestic disturbance on Fernwick.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.337
- Mark it unfounded.
<i>- Copy, 86-37.</i>

03:39.511 --> 03:42.049
<i>We have a 10-33 in your sector.
Requesting backup.</i>

03:42.222 --> 03:46.091
We're good, right?
I don't want no problems with the cops.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.020
You were robbed? You?

03:51.189 --> 03:56.435
- I'm glad my misfortune amuses you.
- It's just the irony caught me by surprise.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.398
Okay. So?

03:59.364 --> 04:02.903
The very rare 1943 Lincoln penny...

04:03.076 --> 04:07.195
...that I liberated
from Grayson Blaise was stolen.

04:07.372 --> 04:11.161
The thief knew where to find me.
He knew I had it. Now he has it.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.451
I need a little help to get it back.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.211
You fooled us once
into helping you acquire that penny.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.623
I think we'll pass
on helping you reacquire it.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.043
The man we're looking for,
this man is on a quest.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.886
Fantastic news.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.766
Loan committee approved an extension.
This is a new payment schedule.

04:28.935 --> 04:33.179
Should keep you from defaulting
and allow you to repair your truck.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.315
- I hear there was an accident.
<i>- He has killed in service of it.</i>

04:36.485 --> 04:39.273
And unless we stop him, he will kill again.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.982
Care to hear more?

04:41.156 --> 04:45.901
In recent years, Federal Reserve Notes
issued in the 1930s...

04:46.077 --> 04:49.115
...have turned up
in Manila and Singapore.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.909
"The United States of America will pay
to the bearer on demand $100,000."

04:54.085 --> 04:57.499
- How many of these notes are around?
- None, according to your government.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.755
It denies issuing any such notes...

04:59.925 --> 05:02.963
...and insists the few
that turned up are counterfeit.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.253
- I thought this was about your penny.
- It is.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.797
Without the pennies,
we'll never find the notes...

05:07.974 --> 05:12.719
- ...or the man who's killing to get them.
- This is never easy.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.389
But your P&L statements
are not promising.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.685
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to foreclose.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.069
Please. I'll do anything.

05:22.239 --> 05:26.108
- Pennies. Wasn't there only one?
- No. There are four. Bronze.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.947
- Minted in 1943.
- Before stealing it...

05:29.120 --> 05:32.204
...you were willing to spend $3 million
to buy one of the pennies.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.617
Collectors value them because they think
they were minted in error.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.662
Bronze one-offs
when every other penny was copper.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.753
But what collectors don't know,
what makes them truly valuable...

05:42.926 --> 05:45.760
...is not that they were a mistake,
but that there is a code.

05:45.929 --> 05:51.220
Put there by the man who minted them,
a map to a vast fortune.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.977
Lost Federal Reserve Notes
that Treasury claims it never made.

05:55.146 --> 05:59.811
Finding the long-lost notes is a quest
for the financial holy grail.

05:59.985 --> 06:04.104
Hundreds of millions of dollars
redeemable upon request.

06:04.281 --> 06:07.024
- The man who attacked you knew this?
- Aram, if you would.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.443
Three security guards murdered
at the Sharjah Art Museum in Dubai.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.489
An Italian art collector dies
when his home is consumed...

06:14.666 --> 06:17.750
...by a fire set by an unknown arsonist.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.083
Last night, an antiques dealer
murdered in Georgetown.

06:21.256 --> 06:25.000
After informing our Blacklister
that I had arranged to meet him.

06:25.176 --> 06:29.170
That's how he got the where and when.
He used that intel to ambush me.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.590
<i>Three incidents, presumably only
three pennies. Leaves him one short.</i>

06:32.767 --> 06:36.727
You were once an insurance investigator.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.560
Funny, I have a personal situation...

06:40.734 --> 06:43.442
...involving a rare coin.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.069
Perhaps we could help each other.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.526
Any indication he knows
where the last penny is?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.784
No, and if he gets it,
he gets the code and treasure.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.787
We need to locate
that penny before he does.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.245
Our only interest is stopping this guy.
Treasure's not our concern.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.753
Don't be a spoilsport. This will be fun.
Where's your sense of adventure?

07:02.923 --> 07:05.916
- I think it sounds like fun.
- Thank you! That's the spirit.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.711
Harold, you could learn a thing or two
from your subordinates.

07:12.599 --> 07:16.218
These are the men I told you about
from the insurance company.

07:16.394 --> 07:20.388
Frank Dobbs. Fairbanks and Hienz.
We underwrite rare collectibles.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.727
And this is our numis...

07:22.901 --> 07:24.312
Numismatic expert.

07:24.486 --> 07:28.947
Ben Farber. I was here last when
you mounted the Eliasberg collection.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.483
Yes, well, Patrick Church,
collections manager.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.153
I understand this is an urgent matter.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.494
It's about the Lincoln penny
you have on display.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.660
Is there somewhere
we could speak privately?

07:41.836 --> 07:43.543
Like I said, we got the call.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.456
Super let us take a look around.
No sign of any problems.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.046
And it was clean? Just like this?

07:49.219 --> 07:50.630
Just like this.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.837
It's too clean.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.466
Whyman, hey. Singleton.

07:57.644 --> 08:01.979
That's right. Don't worry about that.
Warrant's in the works as we speak.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.937
I need a team here now.
I want you to tear this place apart.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.194
Okay, check this out. I think
I may have located the fourth penny.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.114
After the coins were minted,
they disappeared for 30 years.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.407
No record of them anywhere.

08:21.584 --> 08:25.419
But then, in 1975,
they started to appear at auctions.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.080
The missing penny was last sold in 1984.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.001
According to the bill of sale,
the man who bought it...

08:31.177 --> 08:32.918
...passed away two years ago.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.837
- Did he have it when he died?
- Yes.

08:35.015 --> 08:39.385
It was included in an art collection he left
to the University of Pennsylvania.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.644
- So they have the coin?
- Yes and no.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.145
I spoke to the head of donations.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.309
And she says the coin is on loan
at the Gabor Museum.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.650
Ressler and Navabi, get to the museum.
Find out what they know.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.780
How did you become aware of this?

08:53.950 --> 08:58.991
A German auction house sold
a cast fake of a litra from Sicily.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.123
We have reason to believe
that forger duplicated...

09:02.292 --> 09:04.784
...the 1943 coin you have on loan.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.954
If so, you may be able
to help us solve a case...

09:08.131 --> 09:10.839
...that would eclipse
the Ready Electrotypes...

09:11.009 --> 09:13.342
...sold by the British Museum.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.470
- Can that even be possible?
- These people are very skilled.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.722
The estate provided us
with authentication.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.101
If what you're saying is true,
should we be filing a fraud claim?

09:22.270 --> 09:26.389
Let's take this one step at a time.
Is the coin here?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.273
Might I be able to see it?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.901
Of course. Amber.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.817
I want prints run on everything,
from the floorboards to the light bulbs.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.532
If this place was cleaned,
I wanna know how.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.448
What chemicals.
What kind of rags were used.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.834
Check every surface
from the floorboards to the light bulbs.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.619
Because someone was here.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.538
And I wanna know who.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.804
Agent Keen.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.644
Please... Please tell me you're back.

10:09.818 --> 10:14.188
Obviously, you're here, so you're back,
but are you back or just here?

10:14.364 --> 10:15.821
I've missed you too.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.277
Mr. Reddington has us working
this treasure hunt.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.909
- That sounds amazing.
- Remember that penny he got...?

10:21.079 --> 10:24.538
I'm actually just here
to get something out of the files.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.073
Right.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.377
Hey. What's that?

11:05.415 --> 11:08.374
You need to come back. I'm so sorry.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.500
- That's my fault. I didn't...
- I got it.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.036
I ate...

11:12.213 --> 11:13.624
Okay.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.040
You know, it'd be a distraction.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.669
- "A distraction"?
- From looking for Tom's killers.

11:19.846 --> 11:23.339
I don't really see hunting Blacklisters
lightening my emotional load.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.681
Mr. Reddington's penny, there are four.
The Blacklister has three.

11:27.854 --> 11:31.188
Ressler and Navabi are en route
to the Gabor Museum to find the fourth.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.350
I hear it's going well with Agent Navabi.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.234
Talk about a distraction.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.112
I'm here, not back.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.739
Detective Singleton,
what do I owe the pleasure?

11:45.997 --> 11:48.159
- Robert Navarro.
- What about him?

11:48.958 --> 11:52.577
I was under the distinct impression
you were looking for him.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.462
And I got the impression
you didn't want me to.

11:55.632 --> 11:59.251
Even though you believe he works
for the man that killed your husband?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.510
I don't believe. I know.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.507
There was a domestic disturbance
at Navarro's place.

12:06.684 --> 12:10.348
By the time we got there, his apartment
was cleaned. Navarro was gone.

12:10.521 --> 12:14.140
You think I'd murder the one person
who could ID my husband's killer?

12:14.317 --> 12:15.353
Did you?

12:15.526 --> 12:19.440
I'm the last person in the world
who would want Navarro dead.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.361
Now, if there's nothing more...

12:23.534 --> 12:24.900
There isn't.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.696
Not till we receive results
back from the lab.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.909
Results?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.791
From the bloody rag we found
in Navarro's apartment.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.248
Whoever did kill him left it behind.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.171
What do you think?

12:42.220 --> 12:44.007
I wouldn't want to say.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.012
You don't think it's a fake?

12:46.182 --> 12:49.846
I'd want Chandler at the INA to look.
Run some tests.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.476
So it's a fake.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.099
Amber, have Security take the piece
to the safe. Ruben, notify the board...

12:57.277 --> 12:59.644
...and pull the chain of ownership.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.487
Excuse us for a moment.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.243
Gentlemen.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.001
- What's going on?
- Relax.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.287
What? You know why they're here.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.468
Excuse me. Agents Ressler and Navabi,
FBI. What's going on?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.801
We have a situation
about a piece in our collection.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.840
- The Lincoln penny.
- Yes. How did you...?

13:30.018 --> 13:32.180
- Who told you?
- Our insurance company.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.642
Their investigator.
His numismatic expert is in my office.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.774
- Pull the security feeds.
- Can you take us to the expert?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.774
<i>Make your way safely to the exit.</i>

13:43.948 --> 13:47.066
- Your office, it's...?
- Top of those stairs, make a left.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.862
<i>Please make your way safely
to the exit as quickly as possible.</i>

13:52.040 --> 13:55.704
<i>Please make your way safely
to the exit as quickly as possible.</i>

13:57.795 --> 13:59.252
<i>Please make your way...</i>

15:12.870 --> 15:15.658
- You don't have the penny?
<i>- Nor the Blacklister.</i>

15:15.832 --> 15:18.700
- But it was there?
- M.P.D. booked the penny into Evidence.

15:18.876 --> 15:22.665
- They won't let us check it out.
- M.P.D. was there before you?

15:22.839 --> 15:25.547
<i>They received a tip
that the coin was going to be stolen.</i>

15:25.716 --> 15:28.003
- A tip from whom?
- Anonymous.

15:28.177 --> 15:31.966
M.P.D. pulled a print off the coin book.
With luck, it'll ID the thief.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.554
The thief is your concern.
Retrieving that penny is mine.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.969
The FBI won't help you break
into a police evidence vault.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.309
No, I wouldn't think so, Harold.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.649
Let's go to Elizabeth's.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.793
I've been looking for you.

16:07.967 --> 16:13.258
Aram told me the penny from Lake Como
is a treasure map. Do I have that right?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.763
You on some insane treasure hunt?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.549
I'm not the only one.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.595
<i>He also thought a hunt would be
a good distraction for me.</i>

16:20.771 --> 16:25.891
<i>I said no, but to tell you the truth,
I could use a bit of a distraction right now.</i>

16:26.068 --> 16:28.230
If you're looking for me, I hope it's to help.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.147
I've cautioned you
that in your pursuit of Tom's killer...

16:31.324 --> 16:34.908
...you need to restrain
your darker impulses.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.615
Which I've done, mostly.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.949
More or less.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.241
The help I need violates
the spirit of that advice.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.377
I wouldn't ask for it if it wasn't critical.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.753
The answer is yes.

16:46.923 --> 16:50.382
- You haven't even heard the question.
- You're my father. You need help.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.089
It's not like you're gonna ask me
to get rid of a body.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.381
As a result of an anonymous tip,
the M.P.D. has the penny.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.804
I could use your help to get it back.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.186
If it's from a crime scene,
it's downtown in the evidence vault.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.895
Which Harold has shown
no inclination to access on my behalf.

17:07.068 --> 17:11.278
They also keep evidence from felonies:
rape, robbery and homicide.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.480
- Tom's evidence.
<i>- Yes.</i>

17:13.657 --> 17:17.117
I don't have my badge anymore.
The best way to get your penny out...

17:17.286 --> 17:20.074
...is for me to put evidence
from that case in.

17:20.248 --> 17:23.867
- Do you have any?
- No, but I can make some.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.622
Any word from the lab?

17:28.005 --> 17:31.043
- Excited or worried?
- Appreciative of what you're doing.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.051
The rag was booked
into Evidence too late.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.927
Lab won't get it until tomorrow.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.930
I know you think I'm standing in your way.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.807
I'm not trying to.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.969
I hope this helps you see that.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.518
I finally got the courage
to go through Tom's things.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.728
I found this in his jacket pocket.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.814
It's locked,
and I don't have the passcode.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.947
But maybe one of your techs
can pull the records...

17:55.116 --> 17:57.233
...and it might give you a lead.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.122
- Anything yet?
- No.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.494
Remind me again
what it is we think we're doing here.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.130
<i>The phone acts as a passive
packet sniffer, a trick Tom taught me.</i>

18:12.300 --> 18:14.132
"Packet sniffer"?

18:14.468 --> 18:15.584
The FBI uses them.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.718
<i>I'm sure your tech people know
about them.</i>

18:17.888 --> 18:21.347
<i>It can intercept and log traffic
that passes over a digital network.</i>

18:21.517 --> 18:25.056
It is an absolute mystery to me
how these gadgets work.

18:25.229 --> 18:29.189
The Dick Tracy phones,
these Blueteeth connections.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.691
Frankly, I miss the rotary phone.

18:32.862 --> 18:36.026
Except for that zero.
Watching that zero crawl back.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.985
Oh, my God. It was painful.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.155
- We have the code.
- Now we figure out how to get inside.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.576
The lab got an ID
from the print in the coin book.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.460
Abraham Stern.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.872
"Stern, Abraham J."

18:53.049 --> 18:56.292
Loan officer at the Republic
Commerce Bank in Manhattan.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.631
I don't understand.
I did everything you asked.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.887
Yes, and you did marvelously.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.596
If you're upside down on your loan,
Stern tries a new payment schedule.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.182
But, sadly, now the police are involved.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.597
The linen truck
that hit Mr. Reddington's car...

19:09.774 --> 19:11.936
...that company is a client of Stern's bank.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.477
And the insurance investigator
that paid a visit to the Gabor Museum...

19:15.655 --> 19:18.272
...he's also a client risking foreclosure.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.317
So he threatens bankruptcy
unless you help him commit crimes?

19:21.494 --> 19:24.077
Ressler, Navabi, get to the bank.
Bring him in.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.329
I won't say anything.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.365
I'm terribly sorry.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.455
I couldn't possibly take that chance.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.260
Thanks again for doing this.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.843
Let's just be clear about one thing.
This is no favor.

19:44.016 --> 19:48.181
This is a J-O-B. The check,
as they say, better be in the mail.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.141
Yes. I told you twice already.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.021
Why are you stalling?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.478
I don't like pills.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.773
You'll be fine.
You got your ID on you, right?

19:59.573 --> 20:03.032
Okay. I will meet you at the hospital.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.821
Tell you the truth, I'm looking forward
to getting out of the house...

20:06.997 --> 20:08.863
...having time away from Mom.

20:09.041 --> 20:13.251
Hospital's gonna be like a five-star resort,
three squares and a remote.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.413
Juice with a bendy straw.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.081
Between you, me
and the vending machine...

20:18.259 --> 20:22.003
...I've always had a fantasy
about a nurse handling my...

20:23.097 --> 20:26.056
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Something's wrong!

20:26.225 --> 20:29.969
He came up to me at the machine,
short of breath. Is he gonna be okay?

20:30.146 --> 20:32.854
- He's having a heart attack.
- Do you have any aspirin?

20:33.023 --> 20:36.607
- Isn't he supposed to take aspirin?
- It may be in my purse.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.811
I found the aspirin.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.772
Does he need it?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.851
Is he gonna be okay?

21:29.455 --> 21:32.198
<i>- You stole the penny.</i>
- We discussed this.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.913
Your interest is in Stern.
My interest is in his treasure.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.703
Which you can't get to
without his pennies.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.498
Which means you're looking for him too.

21:41.675 --> 21:42.961
Harold, always a pleasure.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.128
We raided the bank he works at
and at home. He's in the wind...

21:46.305 --> 21:49.218
- ...but he'll come for the penny.
- Yes, I believe he will.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.261
You cut a deal.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.142
No, but I hope to.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.857
Okay.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.291
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.047
Mr. Reddington.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.593
Once the professor decodes the cipher...

22:30.766 --> 22:33.884
...what guarantee do I have
you won't double-cross me?

22:34.061 --> 22:37.805
You seem quite capable
of guaranteeing your own safety.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.565
Nevertheless,
I need some kind of assurance.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.851
Fine.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.111
Sentiment.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.648
This is your inheritance.

22:47.825 --> 22:51.364
I wouldn't dream
of taking more than 50 percent.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.574
You have one penny.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.951
I have three.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.370
Seventy-five, twenty-five.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.002
Sentiment only goes so far.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.582
So how do you know about my father?

23:04.758 --> 23:07.125
Do we have a deal or not?

23:08.846 --> 23:12.886
Other than secreting away a fortune
and hiding its whereabouts...

23:13.058 --> 23:17.428
...in the pennies he minted,
I know curiously little about your father.

23:17.605 --> 23:22.020
Usually the person who creates
a legend becomes legendary.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.275
Why not him?

23:25.154 --> 23:28.113
My father was...

23:28.616 --> 23:30.608
...a little man with big dreams.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.653
He worked for the Treasury Department
in Denver, started as an apprentice.

23:35.205 --> 23:39.449
His goal was to become
a master engraver.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.663
But then...

23:40.836 --> 23:42.953
The Federal Reserve Notes went missing.

23:43.130 --> 23:47.090
He had access. So he was a suspect,
but was never charged.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.841
They punished him anyway.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.677
Demoted him to the maintenance staff.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.464
Gave him a little office in the boiler room.

23:54.642 --> 23:58.932
He worked weekends, holidays.
Sometimes, he slept on a cot down there.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.768
Then in '43,
the Mint made security upgrades.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.151
The same year he put the cipher
on the coins.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.152
Within the year, he was let go.

24:08.322 --> 24:12.111
My father spent the rest of his life
living in the shadow of a crime...

24:12.284 --> 24:14.367
...nobody could prove he committed.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.994
He died a broken man.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.995
Penniless.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.876
A lowly maintenance worker.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.004
And yet what he did is...

24:31.095 --> 24:32.427
...legendary.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.553
What he allegedly did.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.387
Sometimes I wonder if that's all there is.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.721
A legend.

24:39.895 --> 24:43.229
If the pennies hold
the secret to your inheritance...

24:43.399 --> 24:45.561
...why didn't your father give them to you?

24:45.734 --> 24:48.351
He did in his will.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.988
But at the time,
I was a snot-nosed 16-year-old.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.444
And to me, he was a failure...

24:54.618 --> 24:58.237
...who had been accused of a crime
he had nothing to show for.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.872
So I spent them on candy.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.373
Four Fireballs.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.787
The next month, his executor gave me
a letter my father had left for me.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.503
That's when I learned that the pennies
were the key to a great treasure.

25:10.676 --> 25:14.465
And you've spent
the past 40 years looking for it.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.557
I've lied. I've cheated.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.470
I've killed in pursuit of it.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.105
I believe my father was a criminal.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.436
And I assume...

25:27.609 --> 25:29.726
...he left me the pennies...

25:29.903 --> 25:32.441
...so I wouldn't become one.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.364
And yet here you are.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.368
The apple never falls very far...

25:39.288 --> 25:40.824
...does it?

26:23.832 --> 26:25.949
The coins are a topographical map...

26:26.126 --> 26:29.710
...depicting a specific set
of geoinformatics.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.372
Look at this. Lincoln's face...

26:32.549 --> 26:37.044
...isn't a face at all but a topographical
representation of a mountain range.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.133
Your father was a talented man.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.389
Front range of the Rocky Mountains.

26:41.558 --> 26:44.676
Pikes Peak through Squaw Mountain.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.264
These crosshatchings...

26:46.438 --> 26:49.727
...they're not random imperfections
but intentionally placed etchings.

26:49.900 --> 26:53.109
One set is meaningless,
but when you begin to layer the images...

26:53.278 --> 26:56.237
...the map begins to depict a grid system.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.570
- Denver.
- Circa 1943.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.326
Look at this, the motto of the U.S.

27:02.496 --> 27:05.239
<i>"E Pluribus Unum,"</i> out of many, one.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.078
The letters on each coin
have imperfections...

27:08.252 --> 27:10.335
...but when you layer them...

27:12.673 --> 27:15.165
The boiler room where he used to work.

27:15.342 --> 27:18.255
He did steal the money.
He just couldn't get it out.

27:18.428 --> 27:21.216
So he hid it right under their noses.

27:21.390 --> 27:25.179
I've imagined robbing the Mint
of the money they make...

27:25.352 --> 27:28.891
...but never of a fortune
they don't even know they have.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.351
But this is a treasure hunt.

27:31.525 --> 27:34.313
And if that's where X marks the spot...

27:37.447 --> 27:39.234
What do you know
about the Denver Mint?

27:39.408 --> 27:43.243
The Mint was built in 1897.
The boiler room's in the basement.

27:43.412 --> 27:47.952
Hasn't been used since renovations done
in '43, abandoning the old boiler room.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.163
Construction documents show
it was sealed off during renovations.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.420
No doors. No windows.
A new vault blocks the only entrance.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.297
What about the air-duct system?

27:56.466 --> 28:00.335
<i>The ducts could give us access if we
were pencil-thin and under 50 pounds.</i>

28:00.512 --> 28:02.845
We're not getting in through the ducting.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.302
Production supplies,
trash and food deliveries...

28:05.475 --> 28:07.512
<i>...pass through daily, but all require IDs.</i>

28:07.686 --> 28:09.769
<i>We'd need a hell of a story
to get through.</i>

28:09.938 --> 28:11.895
<i>We'd have to contend with surveillance.</i>

28:12.065 --> 28:15.479
<i>Which is extensive. Cameras on
the production floor, in the halls.</i>

28:15.652 --> 28:16.813
<i>What about the vault?</i>

28:16.987 --> 28:19.570
<i>Only way into the boiler room
is through that vault.</i>

28:19.740 --> 28:21.857
<i>Which is made of steel and concrete.</i>

28:22.034 --> 28:26.074
- So this is the holding vault?
- Yes. When banks hand over...

28:26.246 --> 28:29.705
...mutilated bills, they're brought here
to have authenticity validated...

28:29.875 --> 28:32.993
...before being shredded
and sent to facilities for disposal.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.502
<i>Sixteen-inch thick concrete.</i>

28:34.671 --> 28:37.379
Concrete that can only be accessed
from inside the vault...

28:37.549 --> 28:40.257
No water supply. We'd have to dry-cut
with diamond blades.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.295
The place is a fortress.
Even if you get past the cameras...

28:43.472 --> 28:45.930
...and guards,
you still have to get in the safe.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.307
And the only thing
they let in there is cash.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.309
Not just any cash.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.596
Random. Untraceable.

28:52.773 --> 28:55.186
The kind you find
in a money-laundering operation.

28:58.487 --> 28:59.944
Heddie.

29:00.113 --> 29:03.322
I need a tally
of our current cash reserves.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.326
Are you freaking nuts?
That's everything we have.

29:06.495 --> 29:07.531
Will it work?

29:07.704 --> 29:10.742
Needs paint, the right decals,
but, yeah, we can make it work.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.828
We'll need uniforms.

29:13.001 --> 29:16.915
My old client at the bank says
IDs are in the works.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.879
In case it's not obvious,
I'm standing right here.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.428
My associate thinks you might
betray me. What do you think?

29:31.186 --> 29:33.394
I think you're the reason...

29:33.563 --> 29:36.977
...I'm finally going to realize
my lifelong dream.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.980
I would never betray you.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.361
On my father's grave.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.404
See? On the grave of his father.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.158
Don't do this.

29:48.328 --> 29:51.036
Heddie, please. Just get the cash.

30:05.387 --> 30:08.175
- You're not on the list.
- We drove straight from the bank.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.465
- You're not on the list.
- Run the badge.

30:10.642 --> 30:14.056
- We're on the list.
- He thinks we're here to rob the place.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.562
Hey, you got us. We're here to rob you.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.395
That's why we're bringing
8 million bucks into the Mint.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.106
Can we move it along?
We got another run up to Golden.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.895
I'd love to beat the traffic.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.490
- There it is.
- Yeah.

30:41.298 --> 30:43.460
I'm afraid your associate was right.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.338
So much for your father's grave.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.760
Your gun belt, please.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.721
I'm sorry, Raymond.
I've come to like you. I really have.

30:53.894 --> 30:56.386
But this is my birthright, not yours.

30:56.563 --> 31:00.648
So if it's not too much trouble,
please, get in the truck.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.239
- Any problems?
- Badge worked like a charm.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.744
Let's go.

31:38.271 --> 31:41.139
I knew we couldn't trust that guy.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.524
Right as always, Heddie.

31:43.693 --> 31:44.979
Everything in place?

31:45.153 --> 31:48.237
Everything but my lady bits.
I don't know how these cops do it.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.906
Let's go to work.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.882
Don't move!

32:12.848 --> 32:16.182
- Zip them up and clear the room.
- Everybody up and face the wall.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.142
Line up.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.598
- Move!
- Hands behind your back.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.690
Hey, boys.

33:39.476 --> 33:40.887
Get the bags.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.572
You should've seen the look
on the boys' faces...

33:59.746 --> 34:03.160
...when I told them I was
gonna run these jacked into the V-8.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.201
- Sure it'll work?
- Oh, it's gonna suck.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.521
What is that? What's happening?

34:28.190 --> 34:29.648
I don't know, Red.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.434
It'll work. Turn it up.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.033
We're in business.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.009
Hello, Harold.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.340
<i>Excuse the rush. I'm on a clock.</i>

34:59.514 --> 35:04.009
I wanted to let you know I discovered
what our friend Abraham Stern is up to.

35:04.185 --> 35:07.098
- Oh, and what is that?
- Robbing the Denver Mint.

35:11.484 --> 35:12.975
Find out what's going on!

35:13.445 --> 35:15.482
Turn it off! Go!

35:15.655 --> 35:18.238
- I'm sorry. He's doing what?
<i>- That was my reaction.</i>

35:18.408 --> 35:22.243
I told him he'd never get away with it.
He seemed determined.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.369
What's that noise? Where are you?

35:24.539 --> 35:28.032
There's a hell of a racket here.
Harold, can you hear me?

35:28.209 --> 35:31.373
Are you telling me that Stern's
father's treasure is in the Mint?

35:31.546 --> 35:33.208
<i>He's certainly convinced so.</i>

35:33.381 --> 35:36.215
The more I think about it,
I'm not sure there's any treasure.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.216
I mean, treasure? Really?

35:38.386 --> 35:40.548
Who knows? Either way, I can't chat.

35:40.722 --> 35:43.430
I've got my hands full
with a plumbing problem.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.092
Good luck with Stern. I have faith in you.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.976
You always get your man.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.356
Reddington says Stern's robbing
the Denver Mint.

35:56.529 --> 35:59.192
- The Mint?
- Reddington's not far behind.

35:59.366 --> 36:03.485
Notify the Denver field office
and get there. Find out what's going on.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.584
- I think we got company.
- Morgan, how long?

36:15.757 --> 36:19.000
No idea.
I think we're gonna need more vans.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.560
- Out of time. Shut it down.
- Are you kidding?

37:23.575 --> 37:25.532
Congratulations, Harold.

37:25.702 --> 37:28.740
- You got your man.
- And you got your treasure.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.404
I don't know how...

37:30.582 --> 37:32.494
...but I know you did.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.118
And the pennies?

37:36.296 --> 37:38.879
Returned to their rightful owners.

37:39.048 --> 37:42.883
All except the one that you lifted
from Grayson Blaise.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.302
Name your price, Harold.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.847
It's too high for you.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.552
Try me.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.805
The truth.

37:53.188 --> 37:57.307
Abraham Stern's father committed
the crime of the 20th century.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.605
<i>I just committed the crime of the 21st.</i>

38:00.779 --> 38:02.441
<i>Except it isn't a crime.</i>

38:02.614 --> 38:06.483
Hundreds of millions in Federal
Reserve Notes. Payable on demand.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.826
<i>Which the Treasury says don't exist.</i>

38:11.331 --> 38:12.947
The Mint said nothing was stolen.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.616
And so the treasure myth lives on.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.161
I appreciate you telling me that truth.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.876
But it isn't the one I was looking for.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.335
The evidence locker.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.218
- What about it?
- What you took aside from the penny.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.719
I didn't take anything else.

38:27.889 --> 38:31.508
Evidence was logged in material
to the disappearance of Robert Navarro.

38:31.684 --> 38:35.143
A person of interest
in the death of Tom Keen.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.179
You didn't take it?

38:37.357 --> 38:39.269
No, I did not.

38:48.076 --> 38:51.069
<i>Dr. Chang to OR 3.</i>

38:51.246 --> 38:54.990
This one says, "Dear Glen,
glad you're okay and recovering well.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.953
Thank you for all you do. R.R."

38:57.126 --> 38:59.334
A secret admirer. One of many.

38:59.504 --> 39:03.498
"P.S. To whom it may concern,
Glen is a licentious cur."

39:03.675 --> 39:04.882
What?

39:05.051 --> 39:08.419
I don't know what "licentious" means.

39:09.347 --> 39:14.263
But I'm pretty sure
he meant it as a compliment.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.261
Is everything okay?

39:17.438 --> 39:20.397
- Dembe said it was urgent.
- You're to be congratulated.

39:21.276 --> 39:24.019
I may be old, but I'm not an old fool.

39:24.195 --> 39:28.189
And you completely hoodwinked me
and Harold.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.110
He thinks I stole a bloody rag
from Evidence.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.619
Right. About that...

39:33.788 --> 39:35.996
You were the anonymous tip.

39:36.165 --> 39:39.533
You told the M.P.D.
that the penny was about to be stolen.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.704
You knew if they stopped
the robbery in progress...

39:42.881 --> 39:44.873
...they'd book the penny into Evidence.

39:45.049 --> 39:48.167
And you didn't call me
to help me steal the penny...

39:48.344 --> 39:52.213
...or to distract you
from your obsession with Tom's killer.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.507
You called me to help me help you...

39:54.684 --> 39:58.223
...retrieve a rag covered in your blood.

39:58.396 --> 40:02.140
Evidence that might have convicted you
of murdering Robert Navarro.

40:02.317 --> 40:07.358
I did not intend to kill him. I intended
to get him to identify Tom's killer.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.943
He got the upper hand.
There was a fight.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.357
Where's the body?

40:11.534 --> 40:14.868
Cooper says it's a missing-persons case,
but if they find that corpse...

40:15.038 --> 40:18.782
- That's not gonna happen.
- I'd like to make sure of that.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.041
I already have.

40:23.254 --> 40:27.294
And in the process,
I discovered Navarro had a glass eye.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.715
- Look at that.
- Wait till you see this.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.804
Some kind of next-gen technology.

40:36.851 --> 40:40.060
I'm sorry I tricked you.
I had no idea what else to do.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.767
But now I do,
and I need your help to do it.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.937
Will you help me?

40:47.111 --> 40:49.228
Of course I'll help you.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.281
What?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.114
Your penny.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.030
Does this mean
you found your treasure, or no?

40:59.207 --> 41:01.665
I've had my eye on a castle in Trieste.

41:01.834 --> 41:06.454
I'm flying over there to make
a large offer on it. Care to join me?

41:09.550 --> 41:11.963
- Bernard.
- You look...

41:12.136 --> 41:14.048
...incomplete.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.514
I just can't believe that's it.

41:17.684 --> 41:21.348
Found in a trunk gathering dust in Surrey.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.103
Hidden treasure indeed.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.855
Authentication papers are inside.

41:27.944 --> 41:29.105
As promised.

41:29.278 --> 41:32.521
Wait. You're gonna use
your penny to buy that?

41:32.699 --> 41:34.656
A bargain at twice the price.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.193
That penny's worth $3 million.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.656
And this is Winston Churchill's hat.

41:48.423 --> 41:51.712
The homburg he wore during the Blitz.

41:51.884 --> 41:55.002
Under its brim, he beat back Hitler...

41:55.179 --> 41:57.762
...with style and grace...

41:58.391 --> 42:01.008
...and unwavering confidence.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.686
I'm an eager if unworthy heir.

42:08.818 --> 42:11.185
What do you think? Be brutal.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.403
It's...

42:13.906 --> 42:16.068
...kind of amazing.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.992
I'll take "amazing."
