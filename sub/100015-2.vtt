WEBVTT

00:01.056 --> 00:02.599
Previously on "Greenleaf".

00:02.623 --> 00:05.664
Reverend Grace Greenleaf. Give it up.

00:06.822 --> 00:08.140
Keep it short.

00:08.196 --> 00:10.140
If you work to be my eyes and ears

00:10.164 --> 00:11.508
among the Greenleafs,

00:11.532 --> 00:14.344
I'd be made head pastor, and not Grace.

00:14.368 --> 00:16.102
I'd definitely make you AP.

00:16.437 --> 00:19.374
- Are you asking me to spy?
- I'm just saying...

00:19.674 --> 00:21.107
you scratch my back and...

00:21.476 --> 00:23.653
I scratch yours, Pastor.

00:24.212 --> 00:27.080
Can I move into Noah's old cabin?

00:27.715 --> 00:29.773
The key's in my desk.

00:29.817 --> 00:31.295
- Thank you.
- It's no secret

00:31.319 --> 00:32.329
that Dante's a handful.

00:32.353 --> 00:33.530
That's why we really want someone

00:33.554 --> 00:35.499
in this position he'll respect.

00:35.523 --> 00:37.668
It sure would help if your name
was on some church's letterhead,

00:37.692 --> 00:40.170
- you know what I'm saying?
- Loud and clear.

00:40.194 --> 00:42.306
I need for you
to hire my brother and sister

00:42.330 --> 00:45.373
as my associate pastors, or I'm out.

00:45.399 --> 00:47.719
Putting family first is a mistake.

00:47.835 --> 00:49.402
That's what I have to do.

00:50.271 --> 00:53.201
- He said Jacob could be AP.
- Yes!

00:53.241 --> 00:55.602
- What about me?
- He wouldn't do it. I'm sorry.

00:56.444 --> 00:58.522
- Noah.
- I just got a phone call

00:58.546 --> 01:00.691
from some inmate at a prison in Arizona.

01:00.715 --> 01:02.442
He says he's our son.

01:26.374 --> 01:27.373
Hey.

01:27.842 --> 01:29.109
I'm sorry.

01:29.677 --> 01:30.970
About what?

01:31.279 --> 01:33.139
The way I behaved last night

01:33.481 --> 01:37.227
when you said Bob said Jacob
could be AP and not me.

01:37.552 --> 01:40.396
Grace, I'm sorry.
I was... I was out of line.

01:40.655 --> 01:42.106
You were disappointed.

01:42.590 --> 01:44.526
- It's okay.
- It's not.

01:44.725 --> 01:47.371
And the thought that you and Jacob

01:47.395 --> 01:49.506
are gonna be working together
at Calvary now,

01:49.530 --> 01:50.707
and me, I'm just...

01:50.731 --> 01:52.509
They won't let me hire you as AP, babe.

01:52.533 --> 01:56.213
I know, but... do you think
they'd let me come back

01:56.237 --> 01:59.182
- as music minister?
- What about Carlton?

01:59.240 --> 02:00.926
He's been begging me to come back.

02:00.975 --> 02:03.220
That H&H lady is driving him nuts.

02:03.244 --> 02:06.047
- You said you were done singing.
- I know what I said.

02:06.414 --> 02:08.132
I just wanna be on the team.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.364
I will talk to Phil tomorrow.

02:14.388 --> 02:17.141
- You will? Really?
- No guarantees, okay?

02:17.592 --> 02:19.185
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:20.928 --> 02:23.523
- Okay.
- Thank you.

02:25.498 --> 02:26.498
You're so good.

02:27.454 --> 02:29.288
Well, go get some sleep, okay?

02:29.670 --> 02:31.237
You too.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.096
It's good to have my sister back.

02:35.609 --> 02:36.608
Amen.

04:12.282 --> 04:14.260
Are you sure you're not able to come?

04:14.284 --> 04:15.895
Oh, I want to, baby, but I have this

04:15.919 --> 04:17.297
last minute meeting.

04:17.321 --> 04:18.971
With that Phil Demars?

04:19.856 --> 04:22.302
That man could stand
to be stood up a few times.

04:22.326 --> 04:24.137
I know. Where does he get his confidence?

04:24.161 --> 04:26.272
I feel like I could push him
over with one finger.

04:26.296 --> 04:27.689
I think he's fine...

04:28.999 --> 04:31.010
in like an evil way.

04:31.034 --> 04:33.002
Well, now, you got the evil part right.

04:33.270 --> 04:34.882
All right. It's your last chance.

04:36.373 --> 04:39.819
A day of haute couture and fancy food

04:39.843 --> 04:42.954
with the most beautiful woman in Memphis.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.358
Mom, please come. It'll be fun.

04:45.382 --> 04:46.859
Oh, baby, we have the whole road trip

04:46.883 --> 04:48.294
to Hampton to talk about clothes.

04:48.318 --> 04:50.763
And, who knows, maybe we'll stop
at some outlet stores.

04:50.787 --> 04:52.932
- Michael Kors in Williamsburg?
- If they have Michael Kors

04:52.956 --> 04:55.868
- in Williamsburg, yes.
- Yes, there is. Okay. Deal.

04:55.892 --> 04:57.510
All right. Have fun.

04:57.761 --> 05:00.173
I love you, guys. Bye.

05:58.689 --> 06:01.801
Well... I know you're upset right now

06:01.825 --> 06:04.202
and feeling a little left out.

06:05.362 --> 06:07.705
But you're still the heart
of this family.

06:08.465 --> 06:09.749
And I know...

06:09.966 --> 06:12.178
...that God has a plan

06:12.202 --> 06:13.702
waiting for you too.

06:14.838 --> 06:16.005
Now...

06:16.907 --> 06:18.925
it's gonna take a minute for you to...

06:19.209 --> 06:20.927
know what it is.

06:23.313 --> 06:24.913
Thanks for saying that, Daddy.

06:25.982 --> 06:27.827
Whether or not it turns out to be true.

06:27.851 --> 06:28.917
It is.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.413
Now... Oh.

06:32.489 --> 06:34.271
I gotta...

06:34.324 --> 06:36.067
I gotta get to my travel agent.

06:36.672 --> 06:38.039
I'm planning a honeymoon.

06:39.029 --> 06:40.740
You and mom are getting remarried?

06:40.764 --> 06:42.406
Well, that depends on your mother.

06:43.086 --> 06:45.201
But... without a vision...

06:46.002 --> 06:47.169
the people perish.

07:00.117 --> 07:01.394
Your 10:00 a.m. with Judee Whitmore

07:01.418 --> 07:03.129
- got moved to next week.
- Mm-hmm.

07:03.153 --> 07:05.131
Wait a minute. Whitmore?
She's Bob's wife?

07:05.155 --> 07:07.834
No. His wife died last year.
She's his daughter.

07:07.858 --> 07:09.969
She's the head of praise
and worship for all H&H.

07:09.993 --> 07:12.171
Huh? So, apparently, nepotism's okay

07:12.195 --> 07:13.506
when it's his family, but not ours.

07:13.530 --> 07:15.406
Mm-hmm. And what does
she want with me anyway?

07:15.431 --> 07:17.483
Oh, she just wants to...

07:17.920 --> 07:19.443
get to know ya.

07:20.180 --> 07:22.915
And Phil says he wants to talk
about Blue Lake when you get in.

07:22.939 --> 07:24.083
It is a summer camp.

07:24.107 --> 07:25.418
What could possibly be the problem?

07:25.442 --> 07:27.286
He just said, "Have Grace see me."

07:27.310 --> 07:28.955
Oh, my gosh. Could you see what he wants?

07:28.979 --> 07:30.423
I thought the deal was just to play nice?

07:30.447 --> 07:32.291
Every morning,
I come in here and it's like,

07:32.315 --> 07:33.982
"Phil wants to see you." Enough.

07:34.484 --> 07:36.896
All right. All right.
I'll take care of it, okay?

07:36.920 --> 07:38.220
Thank you. Thank you.

07:39.823 --> 07:40.956
Is he here yet?

07:41.544 --> 07:44.886
- He's waiting in your office.
- Great.

07:45.896 --> 07:46.995
Thank you.

08:02.279 --> 08:03.378
Hey, Noah.

08:22.532 --> 08:24.300
So, uh...

08:26.269 --> 08:27.553
how was your flight?

08:28.205 --> 08:29.404
How was my flight?

08:30.607 --> 08:32.985
- Are you kidding me?
- I know. I'm sorry. I...

08:33.009 --> 08:34.943
Why didn't you tell me we have a son?

08:35.879 --> 08:37.190
I told you when we talked on the phone.

08:37.214 --> 08:39.058
I knew if you knew that I was pregnant,

08:39.082 --> 08:41.059
- you'd wanna keep it.
- I need to understand

08:41.083 --> 08:42.951
why the hell you kept this from me.

08:46.489 --> 08:49.033
I had just told my parents
about Mac and Faith.

08:49.292 --> 08:51.404
I was leaving home. I was 18 years old.

08:51.428 --> 08:54.038
- I wasn't about to have a child.
- But you did.

08:57.567 --> 08:58.867
I went to a clinic...

09:01.638 --> 09:03.149
but I couldn't go through with it.

09:03.173 --> 09:04.273
I couldn't let him go.

09:11.147 --> 09:12.682
And then I had him.

09:14.317 --> 09:16.218
He was so beautiful.

09:17.254 --> 09:18.253
But the nurse said,

09:18.278 --> 09:20.923
"Give him to me right now
or you'll never be able to."

09:22.425 --> 09:23.492
So I did.

09:25.562 --> 09:27.373
I just wish you would have told me.

09:27.397 --> 09:29.198
I thought that was the end of it.

09:33.036 --> 09:34.203
Does Isabel know you're here?

09:35.505 --> 09:37.248
I told her I'm visiting family.

09:38.241 --> 09:41.243
- So she doesn't know about AJ?
- If she did, she would leave me.

09:41.678 --> 09:43.422
The fact that I have a child with you

09:43.446 --> 09:45.191
and I can't seem to have one with her...

09:45.215 --> 09:46.548
I'm so sorry.

09:51.454 --> 09:53.266
You told me the last time that we spoke

09:53.290 --> 09:54.923
that he contacted you once before.

09:55.525 --> 09:56.525
Yeah.

09:57.413 --> 09:59.603
He found me in Phoenix
after he turned 18.

10:01.431 --> 10:03.142
He got my name from the adoption agency

10:03.166 --> 10:05.133
when they unsealed the files.

10:06.670 --> 10:08.320
Sophia was 12 at the time.

10:08.939 --> 10:11.217
Her dad, Ray, he was always
looking for a reason

10:11.241 --> 10:14.220
to turn her away from me
or take her away. I... I...

10:14.244 --> 10:15.988
So what? You...
you just said, "Get lost?"

10:16.012 --> 10:19.125
Noah... you just said

10:19.149 --> 10:20.927
how you couldn't let him into your life,

10:20.951 --> 10:21.984
because of Isabel.

10:23.586 --> 10:26.465
I know it's not pretty to admit,
but Isabel is real.

10:26.489 --> 10:29.633
Sophia is real. How they feel matters.

10:30.260 --> 10:33.345
How we feel about them matters.
This is complicated.

10:34.531 --> 10:36.198
I'm not saying what I did is right,

10:36.466 --> 10:37.892
by you or him...

10:40.003 --> 10:42.137
I just wanna make it right now.

10:45.308 --> 10:46.341
Then do it.

10:47.744 --> 10:49.570
He's getting released tomorrow.

10:58.789 --> 11:01.290
All right.
Appreciate it. Good to be back.

11:02.425 --> 11:03.669
Noah.

11:03.693 --> 11:05.004
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

11:05.028 --> 11:06.238
Oh, man.

11:06.262 --> 11:07.573
- What's going on?
- I'm good.

11:07.597 --> 11:09.041
What brings you back?

11:09.065 --> 11:10.966
- Uh, just visiting family.
- Yeah.

11:11.234 --> 11:12.927
- Yeah.
- So Gigi knows you're here?

11:13.303 --> 11:15.581
- Yeah. Yeah. We just talked.
- All right. Good.

11:15.605 --> 11:17.450
- So how's Isabel?
- Great. Great.

11:17.474 --> 11:19.683
Uh, how's Kerissa?

11:20.377 --> 11:22.688
Same Excedrin headache, man.

11:22.712 --> 11:26.592
No, I'm kidding. We're good.
Uh... she's good.

11:26.616 --> 11:28.527
Okay. And I see
you're working here again.

11:28.551 --> 11:31.430
Yeah. And back at the house again. Uh,

11:31.454 --> 11:34.056
you know, everything's kind of
upside down and backward, but...

11:34.491 --> 11:36.242
we're figuring it out. You?

11:36.726 --> 11:38.828
Same, you know, life.

11:39.129 --> 11:40.830
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

11:41.231 --> 11:43.242
- Man, it was nice seeing you.
- Hey, you too, man.

11:43.266 --> 11:44.333
All right.

11:45.268 --> 11:46.460
Hey, Noah.

11:46.863 --> 11:49.115
Why don't you come by the house
to see my mom and dad?

11:49.139 --> 11:51.217
Oh. Actually, I'm on my way
to the airport.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.968
- So, maybe next time.
- All right.

11:54.144 --> 11:55.928
- I'll tell them you said hey.
- Oh...

11:56.646 --> 11:57.723
Jacob...

11:57.747 --> 12:00.933
Listen... do me a favor. Don't.

12:01.451 --> 12:02.935
I just don't wanna seem rude.

12:04.387 --> 12:06.647
- Okay.
- Thanks.

12:13.063 --> 12:15.156
My legs look like toothpicks.

12:15.565 --> 12:16.906
Chopsticks.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.577
You're a meal, okay?

12:18.601 --> 12:21.036
All that matters in the romper
is the cheeks.

12:21.404 --> 12:22.663
What's your cheek wattage?

12:23.606 --> 12:24.832
How do I measure it?

12:25.143 --> 12:27.145
Well, if you have to ask,
it's probably too low.

12:27.169 --> 12:28.621
You should be able

12:28.645 --> 12:31.257
to power a small village
with your cheek watts, okay?

12:32.315 --> 12:34.249
I'll show you.

12:35.318 --> 12:36.886
Okay, so you're about like at...

12:37.587 --> 12:39.598
- twenty-five watts?
- What?

12:39.622 --> 12:41.333
- Twenty-five watts.
- Connie?

12:41.357 --> 12:44.136
I'd go smaller, but you could... Yeah.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.353
The devil is a liar!

12:47.430 --> 12:49.664
What the...

12:50.366 --> 12:52.318
What just happened?

12:52.836 --> 12:54.102
Uh...

12:56.339 --> 12:57.573
I dropped my phone.

12:59.642 --> 13:00.709
Got a second?

13:01.244 --> 13:02.277
Pastor Greenleaf.

13:02.679 --> 13:04.079
Welcome aboard.

13:04.647 --> 13:07.625
I, uh... trust you're settling in?

13:08.284 --> 13:09.284
I am.

13:09.697 --> 13:11.295
You know, it's just like riding a bike.

13:12.856 --> 13:14.633
You know, before Gigi
came back to Memphis,

13:14.657 --> 13:16.124
I was AP under Bishop.

13:16.559 --> 13:18.052
I know. So...

13:18.895 --> 13:20.272
what can I do for you?

13:20.296 --> 13:22.274
Oh. Well, Gigi told me you wanted to talk

13:22.298 --> 13:24.558
about Blue Lake so I'm here to follow up.

13:25.368 --> 13:27.413
She's too busy to cross the hall?

13:27.437 --> 13:29.563
Oh, uh, she just got pulled
into a meeting.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.140
Well, okay then. All right.

13:32.442 --> 13:34.360
Well, listen. Uh, I know...

13:34.611 --> 13:37.556
Calvary has a long history
with this Cabin Blue Lake

13:37.580 --> 13:39.558
and I'm sure the program is exceptional,

13:39.582 --> 13:43.577
but... H&H has over 20 camps nationwide.

13:43.786 --> 13:45.531
They're better equipped,
racially diverse,

13:45.555 --> 13:48.519
and to be honest, uh, much cheaper.

13:48.558 --> 13:51.226
Well, well... I don't know
about cheaper...

13:51.561 --> 13:52.905
But we've always felt, uh,

13:52.929 --> 13:55.965
I know my parents feel this way,
I'm sure Gigi does too,

13:56.332 --> 14:00.212
that it's nice that summer camp
gives our kids a little break

14:00.236 --> 14:02.179
from diversity, you know what I'm saying?

14:02.372 --> 14:04.183
I mean, they're getting
that diversity thing

14:04.207 --> 14:05.641
real heavy every day.

14:06.376 --> 14:07.342
Where?

14:08.311 --> 14:09.444
Well, America.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.526
See... Blue Lake allows our kids

14:13.550 --> 14:15.183
to focus on their black heritage,

14:15.518 --> 14:18.362
food, art, dance, music.

14:18.521 --> 14:20.698
I'm sure you could see the value in that.

14:21.224 --> 14:23.492
Well, even if I saw the value...

14:23.927 --> 14:26.870
I don't see the savings. We can't do it.

14:27.776 --> 14:28.909
Because of the money?

14:31.267 --> 14:33.279
Well, since I don't have time
right now to walk you

14:33.303 --> 14:35.414
through Harmony of Hope's
denominational commitment

14:35.438 --> 14:37.650
to... encourage better relationships

14:37.674 --> 14:39.385
between all races

14:39.409 --> 14:41.587
in the context of Christian love

14:41.611 --> 14:44.446
and what we see
as the value of that, yes,

14:44.447 --> 14:47.224
because of... the money.

14:47.483 --> 14:49.628
And if Pastor Grace
has a problem with that, hmm,

14:49.652 --> 14:51.603
she can come see me about it herself.

14:52.455 --> 14:53.555
Welcome back...

14:54.958 --> 14:56.224
brother.

15:01.464 --> 15:02.564
Okay then.

15:08.671 --> 15:09.704
Hey.

15:11.774 --> 15:13.485
Do you remember that trip
to Paris that I was...

15:13.509 --> 15:14.876
Not now, James.

15:28.391 --> 15:30.258
Did those girls upset you somehow?

15:30.893 --> 15:32.538
Oh, the girls are fine.

15:32.562 --> 15:35.263
They're down there in Zora's
bungalow being delightful.

15:35.965 --> 15:38.633
So, may I inquire
what's got you so, uh...

15:39.448 --> 15:41.249
- flustered?
- Connie Sykes, of course.

15:42.538 --> 15:43.816
Ugh, what has she done now?

15:43.840 --> 15:46.819
Oh, sent me an invoice
of overages related

15:46.843 --> 15:48.520
till she changes everything.

15:48.544 --> 15:50.522
The hell she did? For how much?

15:50.546 --> 15:52.447
It's not about the money, James.

15:54.884 --> 15:57.519
It is about the audacity of this...

15:58.327 --> 16:00.438
paper cut-out of a woman...

16:00.463 --> 16:02.549
Who thinks she can bully me like this.

16:06.529 --> 16:09.675
I mean, I know we are all equal
in God's eyes,

16:09.699 --> 16:11.710
but there is something uniquely grating

16:11.734 --> 16:13.712
about the way people with no class

16:13.736 --> 16:15.347
flaunt their power when they get it.

16:15.371 --> 16:17.683
I mean, it is just amateurish

16:17.707 --> 16:20.109
and brutish and dumb.

16:21.711 --> 16:23.654
What's that?

16:24.681 --> 16:27.249
Um... it's nothing. Just a,

16:27.617 --> 16:29.535
a... a bid from the exterminator.

16:29.719 --> 16:30.752
Oh?

16:30.987 --> 16:33.565
Well, please give them Connie's address

16:33.589 --> 16:35.624
and tell them to spare no expense.

16:35.758 --> 16:39.705
Tell them that I won't be happy
until every crawling thing

16:39.729 --> 16:41.707
in that house is laying on its back,

16:41.731 --> 16:43.008
begging God for mercy,

16:43.032 --> 16:45.717
starting first and foremost with her.

16:49.972 --> 16:52.766
Lord, help me! I know you don't like...

17:01.718 --> 17:03.652
Yo.

17:04.053 --> 17:05.420
Hey.

17:07.031 --> 17:08.097
So...

17:09.959 --> 17:12.838
your boy, Phil Demars, is something else.

17:12.862 --> 17:15.507
I mean, he's like
Uncle Tom meets Voldemort.

17:15.531 --> 17:17.810
What is his problem with Blue Lake?

17:17.834 --> 17:20.468
He thinks it's too spendy.

17:20.737 --> 17:23.547
- Well, how much is it per kid?
- See, it's not even really that.

17:24.107 --> 17:26.117
There's some denominational mission

17:26.142 --> 17:27.685
for diversity he wants to enforce.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.655
We've been sending kids
to Blue Lake for 20 years.

17:29.679 --> 17:31.023
- Tell him no.
- He said if you got

17:31.047 --> 17:33.056
a problem with it,
you come see him yourself.

17:34.450 --> 17:36.929
Just reserve the spots at Blue Lake,

17:36.953 --> 17:39.646
- I'll pay the difference.
- That's gonna add up very quick.

17:40.823 --> 17:41.890
It doesn't matter.

17:43.659 --> 17:44.818
Okay.

17:46.662 --> 17:47.873
Good to know somebody in this family

17:47.897 --> 17:49.265
has been saving their money.

17:53.770 --> 17:54.836
Oh, um...

17:56.606 --> 17:57.739
I saw Noah was here.

17:58.808 --> 17:59.875
Mm-hmm.

18:00.676 --> 18:01.876
Everything all right with him?

18:03.265 --> 18:04.369
Why?

18:04.780 --> 18:06.173
I don't know.
He just seemed a little off.

18:07.717 --> 18:09.728
I think maybe he and Isabela
are having trouble.

18:09.752 --> 18:12.012
- I don't know.
- Oh. Hmm.

18:12.688 --> 18:13.688
I get it.

18:14.590 --> 18:15.968
- See you later.
- All right.

18:15.992 --> 18:17.603
- Love you.
- Love you.

18:28.037 --> 18:29.548
Hello. Communicate Network.

18:29.572 --> 18:32.484
Uh, hi. I need to set up
an offender phone account

18:32.508 --> 18:33.819
for AJ Delahey.

18:33.843 --> 18:35.443
And to whom am I speaking?

18:36.012 --> 18:39.039
Um... my name is Grace Greenleaf.

18:41.651 --> 18:42.684
I'm his mother.

18:52.195 --> 18:54.629
So what do you think?

18:54.864 --> 18:56.708
- Oh.
- I sent you this listing,

18:56.732 --> 18:58.177
because I know your taste.

18:58.201 --> 18:59.945
- I think this could be the one.
- Oh.

18:59.969 --> 19:01.436
How much is it gonna go for ultimately?

19:01.704 --> 19:03.605
Hmm, high threes, maybe four.

19:03.940 --> 19:06.185
I mean, this neighborhood
is gaining in value.

19:06.209 --> 19:08.009
- It is a great investment.
- Mm-hmm.

19:08.878 --> 19:11.757
Make sure you take some cookies.
They're inside on the table.

19:11.781 --> 19:12.814
Sugar-free.

19:13.115 --> 19:14.726
Look, I know it's a good deal,

19:14.750 --> 19:16.456
but we're kind of cash-poor right now.

19:16.481 --> 19:19.329
- Your in-laws couldn't help you?
- Girl, I'd rather sell plasma.

19:23.726 --> 19:25.971
You know what?
Let me see what I can work out.

19:25.995 --> 19:27.254
Okay? Thanks.

I don't know if I can do this.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.625
You should have heard him.
He said I was the heart

20:53.649 --> 20:54.749
of the family.

20:57.987 --> 20:59.388
Is that how he treats you?

21:00.690 --> 21:02.134
Like you're the heart of the family?

21:02.158 --> 21:04.069
Not all the time maybe, but...

21:04.093 --> 21:06.171
Watch what a man does, not what he says,

21:06.195 --> 21:08.173
and you'll see who he is.

21:08.197 --> 21:09.741
I know he's not perfect, Phil.

21:09.765 --> 21:11.310
Well, he's the only pastor
I know who's been accused

21:11.334 --> 21:13.245
of arson, negligent manslaughter,

21:13.269 --> 21:15.814
and still owes the IRS
two million in back taxes.

21:15.838 --> 21:18.917
So, forgive me if I reserve
my benefit of the doubt

21:18.941 --> 21:20.652
for someone who deserves it.

21:20.676 --> 21:22.955
- Who?
- Do you think I offered you

21:22.979 --> 21:26.748
the AP position to... buy your loyalty?

21:28.310 --> 21:29.292
No.

21:29.810 --> 21:33.298
I did it, because I saw in you
a beautiful child of God

21:33.322 --> 21:35.549
in the grip of a family
who doesn't know...

21:36.392 --> 21:39.678
who doesn't see the jewel she is.

21:41.764 --> 21:43.031
Why would you say that?

21:44.233 --> 21:46.034
If you don't mean it, that's cruel.

21:48.237 --> 21:49.771
Do you think you know people?

21:51.741 --> 21:54.484
I didn't once, obviously, but yes.

21:54.977 --> 21:56.945
Well, after all
you've been through, you better.

21:59.015 --> 22:01.649
Hey. Look in my eyes, Charity.

22:03.919 --> 22:05.019
Tell me I'm lying.

22:05.955 --> 22:07.289
I know what you are.

22:07.657 --> 22:08.723
I see it all.

22:09.759 --> 22:10.992
And it's good.

22:16.966 --> 22:18.175
You're making me shy.

22:18.935 --> 22:20.677
There's nothing wrong with shy.

22:22.038 --> 22:24.097
Especially the way it looks on you.

22:31.747 --> 22:32.847
That's game.

22:33.315 --> 22:34.826
Oh, man.

22:34.850 --> 22:37.229
Hey. You did a lot better than that guy.

22:37.253 --> 22:38.797
Yo. Hey, yo, D,

22:38.821 --> 22:40.132
when are you trying to drop him off

22:40.156 --> 22:41.900
and go to the city? I got to go, man.

22:41.924 --> 22:43.700
Soon, bruh. Soon.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.937
Everybody's got to be somewhere.

22:45.961 --> 22:47.537
Yeah, ain't that right?

22:49.031 --> 22:49.931
Hey.

22:50.829 --> 22:54.846
So, listen... I know the team
is giving you a little stipend

22:54.870 --> 22:56.148
or whatever it is...

22:56.172 --> 22:57.849
but I figure a little something extra

22:57.873 --> 22:59.140
couldn't hurt your pockets.

23:00.409 --> 23:02.020
Extra? Like, extra what?

23:02.044 --> 23:03.303
I'mma do me.

23:03.820 --> 23:05.957
And I can't have you
reporting back to management

23:05.981 --> 23:08.349
every time I feel like blowing
ten racks up in a club.

23:10.453 --> 23:11.830
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Take it.

23:11.854 --> 23:13.688
Whoa, whoa. Put your money away.

23:14.957 --> 23:17.125
- That's ten grand.
- I... Dante...

23:18.227 --> 23:20.111
I get it. But look...

23:23.316 --> 23:24.409
I wasted a good part

23:24.433 --> 23:26.878
of my life
thinking I could run up the bill

23:26.902 --> 23:29.037
and... the check would never come.

23:31.079 --> 23:32.412
But the check comes.

23:33.909 --> 23:35.710
So, I don't want your money man.

23:36.846 --> 23:37.845
Put it away.

23:40.876 --> 23:42.592
I was just testing you anyhow.

23:43.352 --> 23:45.263
Trying to see if you the real holy man

23:45.287 --> 23:46.854
my mom made you out to be.

23:47.389 --> 23:49.157
You might make a saint of me yet.

23:52.895 --> 23:54.740
- Let's go, man.
- For real?

23:54.764 --> 23:56.908
- I'm ready now.
- Hey, I gotta go, man.

23:56.932 --> 23:58.310
Look, I'm not trying to worry
or anything...

23:58.334 --> 23:59.400
I'm your ride, right?

23:59.425 --> 24:01.446
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah. It's better than Uber.

24:01.470 --> 24:03.238
Your brother came and saw me.

24:04.106 --> 24:06.407
Now, he maybe your right-hand,
but he isn't mine.

24:07.009 --> 24:08.410
Now when I ask to see you,

24:08.878 --> 24:10.620
I expect the courtesy of a visit.

24:11.046 --> 24:13.498
Phil... I don't know how to put this.

24:14.483 --> 24:16.328
- I don't work for you.
- I'm the Southern

24:16.352 --> 24:18.152
Conference Minister of Harmony Hope.

24:18.387 --> 24:21.366
Every... pastor
within this region looks to me

24:21.390 --> 24:23.101
for guidance and support.

24:23.125 --> 24:25.927
And if I need either of those,
I'll let you know, okay?

24:26.262 --> 24:28.206
Deal.

24:28.230 --> 24:30.475
I see you went ahead
and, uh, paid the non-refundable

24:30.499 --> 24:33.852
application fee to Blue Lake
without my sign off?

24:34.036 --> 24:35.687
I paid with my own money.

24:35.938 --> 24:38.150
Do you plan on paying
all the fees for this program?

24:38.174 --> 24:39.551
Because, eventually,
it's gonna go upwards...

24:39.575 --> 24:42.068
Hundred thousand dollars. I know.

24:42.478 --> 24:44.988
Oh. Do you have that kind of cash?

24:45.214 --> 24:46.247
I do.

24:48.851 --> 24:49.868
Okay.

24:50.486 --> 24:51.963
We'll pay the rest,

24:51.987 --> 24:53.788
but you're gonna have
to explain it to Bob.

24:57.026 --> 24:59.252
I'd be more than happy to. But, Phil...

25:00.329 --> 25:02.207
my sister did ask about coming back

25:02.231 --> 25:03.875
as a music minister, and I told her

25:03.899 --> 25:05.550
- you wouldn't go for that, so...
- That's fine.

25:07.903 --> 25:10.081
See? I'm quite amenable
when I'm approached

25:10.105 --> 25:11.890
with the requisite respect.

25:20.416 --> 25:23.428
The fact that he's hanging out
with this fine-ass man

25:23.452 --> 25:25.163
and doesn't invite me?

25:27.022 --> 25:28.122
He's punishing me.

25:30.159 --> 25:31.259
You know, I'm not gonna go.

25:32.027 --> 25:33.995
To Hampton? Shut up.

25:34.330 --> 25:36.414
Look, it's like they're besties
or something.

25:37.333 --> 25:38.866
It's outrageous.

25:39.268 --> 25:40.835
Yeah. I'm just gonna go in the fall.

25:41.003 --> 25:44.216
I mean, I heard summer
in Hampton is buggy anyways.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.251
But you already paid
for your summer classes,

25:46.275 --> 25:48.220
- haven't you?
- It's just two classes.

25:48.244 --> 25:49.344
I'll get a refund.

25:50.213 --> 25:52.180
I don't wanna miss this summer with you.

25:52.414 --> 25:53.807
Or with my mom.

25:54.116 --> 25:55.558
Okay. I'll support you...

25:56.485 --> 25:57.885
under one condition.

25:58.988 --> 26:00.897
- Name it.
- You have to live here with me.

26:03.225 --> 26:05.777
It'll be a stretch but, uh...

26:06.996 --> 26:09.174
- Fine.
- And you have to come

26:09.198 --> 26:11.376
to Bible time with me
and Grandma in the mornings.

26:13.168 --> 26:14.494
That's two conditions.

26:14.519 --> 26:16.413
I expanded my demands on the fly.

26:16.572 --> 26:18.748
Learned that from The Art of War.

26:19.141 --> 26:20.174
What's that?

26:21.277 --> 26:22.487
One of Noah's old books.

26:22.511 --> 26:24.356
There's lot of, like,
kooky old stuff in here

26:24.380 --> 26:26.157
and I'm pretty sure it's haunted.

26:26.181 --> 26:27.615
Like, seriously haunted.

26:29.451 --> 26:31.263
Why do I have to do Bible study?

26:31.287 --> 26:33.555
Because I have to do it. Duh.

26:34.390 --> 26:35.667
Okay. I'll wake you up in the morning,

26:35.691 --> 26:36.924
but I'm not going.

26:37.693 --> 26:40.645
Okay. Fine. We'll be like... spinsters.

26:40.996 --> 26:42.930
What's a spinster?

26:43.565 --> 26:45.043
I never really knew.

27:06.722 --> 27:09.100
Bishop, I could get into a lot of trouble

27:09.124 --> 27:10.268
for printing that out for you,

27:10.292 --> 27:12.237
so you can't tell anyone
where you got it.

27:12.261 --> 27:13.636
Not even Lady Mae.

27:14.263 --> 27:15.597
You have my word.

27:16.565 --> 27:18.099
- Thanks, K.
- Mm-hmm.

27:28.510 --> 27:30.695
This sure don't feel like church.

27:43.418 --> 27:45.293
- Hi.
- Hey, honey.

27:46.028 --> 27:49.040
I'm sorry I'm home late.
Zora and I, we're moving stuff

27:49.064 --> 27:52.033
down there and just... couldn't stop.

27:54.449 --> 27:55.553
Oh.

27:58.694 --> 28:00.027
Is something the matter?

28:01.336 --> 28:02.503
Ultimately, no.

28:04.113 --> 28:05.690
Uh, but I do have to tell you something.

28:05.714 --> 28:07.348
Can you... can you sit for a minute?

28:07.583 --> 28:08.582
Yeah, sure.

28:09.651 --> 28:11.629
I have some news for you too,

28:11.653 --> 28:13.198
and I think you're gonna like it.

28:13.222 --> 28:15.122
- Yeah? What's going on?
- You first.

28:23.766 --> 28:25.299
I don't know what to say.

28:25.734 --> 28:27.301
It's okay if you're upset.

28:29.571 --> 28:31.282
I'm not upset. I just...

28:31.306 --> 28:33.274
Sophia.

28:37.179 --> 28:38.179
My whole life...

28:39.615 --> 28:40.726
all you've done is complain

28:40.750 --> 28:44.394
about how grandma and grandpa
weren't there for Faith.

28:46.622 --> 28:48.606
I told you, I'm gonna help AJ.

28:49.825 --> 28:51.325
By sending him money.

28:53.695 --> 28:55.071
You're his mom.

28:56.632 --> 28:58.658
What he wants is his mom.

29:04.540 --> 29:05.920
Honey, will you sit back down please?

29:05.944 --> 29:07.077
Sit back down.

29:12.514 --> 29:14.716
I don't want you coming
with me to Hampton.

29:15.684 --> 29:17.886
- I'll just drive myself.
- Oh, no.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.138
You can't drive yourself all that way.

29:20.489 --> 29:22.056
I can do whatever I want.

29:23.826 --> 29:26.137
Sophia. Sophia.

29:26.161 --> 29:27.395
What?

29:29.398 --> 29:31.691
There is too much on the line
for me right now...

29:32.568 --> 29:36.613
the congregation...
Harmony and Hope, okay?

29:37.806 --> 29:40.374
Just for now,
this has to stay between us.

29:41.443 --> 29:43.177
You are such a hypocrite.

29:50.652 --> 29:52.795
You see, there's
all the evidence you need.

29:53.422 --> 29:54.488
Right there.

29:55.390 --> 29:57.675
H&H was paying off Connie Sykes.

30:00.162 --> 30:01.228
How did you get this?

30:02.564 --> 30:03.875
It doesn't matter how I got it.

30:03.899 --> 30:06.467
All that matters
is how you got it, James.

30:07.136 --> 30:08.613
Who gave you this? Karine?

30:08.637 --> 30:10.897
Mae. Mae. Look.

30:11.406 --> 30:13.066
Look at the date on that check.

30:13.375 --> 30:15.409
The last check
deposited into Connie's account?

30:16.345 --> 30:18.289
Two days after they joined H&H.

30:18.313 --> 30:19.613
So, it was Karine.

30:21.216 --> 30:23.910
Don't you see this is why
they don't trust you?

30:24.186 --> 30:25.870
Pulling this kind of garbage.

30:26.155 --> 30:27.419
Why they don't trust me?

30:27.444 --> 30:30.401
Well, who else was at the wheel
when the ship went aground? Me?

30:30.425 --> 30:31.769
I'm trying to get this church
back for you,

30:31.793 --> 30:33.505
and this is what you wanna
throw back at me?

30:33.529 --> 30:38.543
No. All I am doing is trying to
tell a man whom God just spared

30:38.567 --> 30:40.745
to turn back and quit your foolish ways,

30:40.769 --> 30:43.481
or the selfsame Lord
who restarted your heart

30:43.505 --> 30:45.783
- is gonna stop it.
- My heart is just fine.

30:45.807 --> 30:47.934
- Thank you.
- No, it's not.

30:49.811 --> 30:51.412
This is not the way.

30:54.483 --> 30:57.184
James, God is talking to me
and I'm listening.

30:58.187 --> 31:01.466
Now, I despise Connie
just as much as you do,

31:01.490 --> 31:03.535
even more, but this is not the way

31:03.559 --> 31:04.936
that we're gonna win back this church.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.954
It's not. Not by power and might.

31:08.463 --> 31:11.509
Not by sneaking around
and pointing fingers.

31:11.533 --> 31:13.912
Not by blaming and shaming.

31:13.936 --> 31:16.963
"By my will"...

31:18.240 --> 31:19.757
says the Lord.

31:23.478 --> 31:25.847
James, we have to get our house in order.

31:27.683 --> 31:30.728
We have to get our hearts in order,

31:30.752 --> 31:32.979
or we're gonna lose everything.

31:38.527 --> 31:39.660
What are you doing?

31:41.363 --> 31:45.950
Inching you back from the edge
of an abyss that I fear...

31:46.902 --> 31:49.370
you are inexplicably unaware.

32:09.358 --> 32:10.457
You like it?

32:11.976 --> 32:13.972
Uh, where will we get
the money to pay for this?

32:13.996 --> 32:15.438
We can sell the land.

32:15.985 --> 32:18.119
- The real church land?
- Yes.

32:18.686 --> 32:21.188
It's just sitting across
from Calvary doing nothing.

32:21.510 --> 32:24.622
And, I mean, if we even got
what we paid for it,

32:24.647 --> 32:26.781
we... we'd have a good down payment.

32:27.595 --> 32:28.728
I... I don't wanna sell it.

32:30.098 --> 32:32.080
Jacob, I want out of this house.

32:32.814 --> 32:35.382
Okay. And I want you out of this house.

32:35.407 --> 32:38.169
- Excuse me?
- Uh, with me.

32:39.488 --> 32:41.699
Come on. I want you to have
what you want, Kerissa.

32:41.723 --> 32:43.768
- Don't do that.
- Well, then how come...

32:43.792 --> 32:45.536
How come we can't sell that land,

32:45.560 --> 32:48.329
buy this house, and make a fresh start?

32:48.930 --> 32:50.831
Why isn't that the obvious move?

32:53.729 --> 32:55.196
Something happened to me today.

32:55.824 --> 32:57.291
- Okay?
- What?

32:58.386 --> 33:00.274
I got through to this kid, a little...

33:00.942 --> 33:03.888
all right? And I... I got
to a place inside myself

33:03.912 --> 33:04.878
that I've never been.

33:05.164 --> 33:06.844
Okay. But what does
that have to do with this?

33:06.868 --> 33:08.207
I mean if we could use that land

33:08.231 --> 33:10.017
to do something for kids like him...

33:10.718 --> 33:13.353
- By doing what though?
- I don't know yet.

33:13.855 --> 33:17.250
I know, but, like... what even maybe?

33:17.985 --> 33:19.452
I just know that that land...

33:20.382 --> 33:22.349
is one of the few solid things
we have left.

33:23.031 --> 33:24.298
And I don't wanna sell it.

33:27.829 --> 33:30.975
Can I at least ask Nadine
to do a market analysis

33:31.000 --> 33:33.479
to see what we could potentially
get for it?

33:33.504 --> 33:35.438
- No!
- Jacob!

33:36.078 --> 33:38.356
My name in on that deed
right next to yours.

33:38.380 --> 33:41.015
- I don't have to ask.
- Okay. But you did,

33:41.343 --> 33:43.844
and I'm telling you just wait one beat.

33:45.020 --> 33:47.155
All right, asking you, honey. Listen...

33:48.604 --> 33:50.471
just give me a week to pray on it

33:50.859 --> 33:52.904
and if the Lord gives me nothing,

33:52.928 --> 33:54.028
I'll tell you.

33:55.097 --> 33:57.064
But just give me one week.

34:35.170 --> 34:36.437
Sophia.

34:37.385 --> 34:39.362
Sophia, please don't do this.

34:39.388 --> 34:41.208
It's too far for you to drive alone.

34:42.878 --> 34:46.112
Well... I'm not driving alone.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.692
Who's going with you?

34:47.716 --> 34:50.128
Dad. I called him last night.

34:50.152 --> 34:51.819
I'm picking him up at the airport.

34:55.424 --> 34:57.058
I love you.

35:00.495 --> 35:02.507
Baby.

35:02.531 --> 35:04.765
Baby... I said I love you.

35:10.105 --> 35:11.983
Yeah. I heard you.

35:12.007 --> 35:13.199
Sophia.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.243
Sweetheart... Sweetheart...

35:18.980 --> 35:21.082
Where is she going so early?

35:24.019 --> 35:25.930
- Hampton.
- But I thought

35:25.954 --> 35:28.088
- that y'all were going together.
- Things changed, Mom.

35:29.825 --> 35:31.551
Well, don't you wanna talk about it?

35:33.128 --> 35:34.887
I don't.

35:37.966 --> 35:39.825
Where... Where's Sophia going?

35:41.903 --> 35:43.748
- To college.
- Wait. What?

35:43.772 --> 35:45.216
I thought she was staying?

35:45.240 --> 35:47.441
- What happened?
- I don't know.

36:11.700 --> 36:12.783
Father...

36:14.035 --> 36:15.936
I know we haven't talked
in a while, but...

36:19.681 --> 36:21.017
I need some guidance.

36:27.649 --> 36:28.893
I feel like I've got an opportunity

36:28.917 --> 36:30.050
to do something here.

36:31.586 --> 36:32.619
It's big.

36:37.025 --> 36:38.287
Something new.

36:43.978 --> 36:45.666
Just don't know what it is.

36:48.036 --> 36:49.570
If you got any ideas...

36:53.074 --> 36:54.942
please let me know.

37:06.522 --> 37:08.165
Now, I've told you
that about Darlene, Karine,

37:08.189 --> 37:09.857
so you've got to give a sister something.

37:10.859 --> 37:11.959
Anything.

37:13.095 --> 37:15.072
Okay. I can tell you this,
but you did not hear this

37:15.096 --> 37:16.207
from me, all right?

37:16.231 --> 37:18.843
Honey, if Darlene knew
I told you what I just told you,

37:18.867 --> 37:21.012
she would cut me up in pieces
and throw me in the river

37:21.036 --> 37:22.231
in an old cheap suitcase.

37:23.672 --> 37:25.005
Yes. You know it. Come on.

37:26.641 --> 37:27.674
Noah.

37:29.077 --> 37:30.844
Well, what about him?

37:31.680 --> 37:33.046
Why, Lady Mae.

37:33.601 --> 37:34.701
What a surprise.

37:35.984 --> 37:37.117
Walk with me?

37:38.219 --> 37:39.520
Of course.

37:47.362 --> 37:49.874
Karine, I'm sure
it's tempting to see this

37:49.898 --> 37:51.865
as a period of transition.

37:52.300 --> 37:53.867
I'm not sure what you mean.

37:54.169 --> 37:57.248
Well, this interim year
while Grace will be Head Pastor

37:57.272 --> 38:00.217
and while Harmony and Hope
seeps through this church

38:00.241 --> 38:01.909
- like a fog.
- Mm-hmm.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.873
But... in God's time...

38:08.383 --> 38:10.376
there are no transitions.

38:10.752 --> 38:14.198
It's just the steady march
to holiness or hell,

38:14.222 --> 38:18.603
and every day is a step up
or a step down.

38:18.627 --> 38:22.329
- I know. I thought to call you.
- And a smart thought that was.

38:22.864 --> 38:26.077
Next time you should heed
that still small voice,

38:26.101 --> 38:27.901
because it will keep you in good stead.

38:28.637 --> 38:29.703
And, Karine...

38:30.772 --> 38:32.883
You may be of use to me
at some point in the future,

38:32.907 --> 38:36.253
so I would appreciate it
if you'd avoid getting canned.

38:36.277 --> 38:38.612
Yes, Ma'am.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.180
Oh.

38:43.351 --> 38:44.351
Here.

38:45.086 --> 38:46.297
Please see that Connie gets that

38:46.321 --> 38:48.088
before the board meeting tonight.

38:48.390 --> 38:49.756
I'll spare you the question.

38:50.058 --> 38:54.038
It is payment in full
for all remaining cost

38:54.062 --> 38:55.373
from my day with Lady Mae.

38:55.397 --> 38:58.042
- Oh.
- Feel free to let anyone

38:58.066 --> 39:02.303
who wonders know
that I pay my debts in full...

39:03.071 --> 39:05.672
per... Romans 13:7.

39:06.007 --> 39:08.051
Romans 13:7. Got it.

39:08.076 --> 39:09.477
Are you familiar with it?

39:09.911 --> 39:12.980
Not word for... No.

39:13.682 --> 39:17.361
What is going to get us
through this turbulent time

39:17.385 --> 39:19.904
is the righteousness of God, Karine.

39:20.722 --> 39:21.855
Yes, Ma'am.

39:31.700 --> 39:35.179
You can fast and pray all you want,

39:35.203 --> 39:38.998
you could know every verse
of numbers by heart, Pastor,

39:39.040 --> 39:42.279
but if you don't get your praise program

39:42.310 --> 39:47.091
to where people are dying
to come to church and sing...

39:47.115 --> 39:48.882
Your church

39:49.117 --> 39:50.283
is gonna die.

39:50.952 --> 39:53.064
- Can I get an Amen?
- Amen!

39:53.088 --> 39:54.432
Can I get an A...

40:02.397 --> 40:04.014
- Hello?
- Hello,

40:04.065 --> 40:05.743
you have a prepaid phone call from...

40:05.767 --> 40:07.712
- AJ Delahey.
- An inmate

40:07.736 --> 40:10.213
at the Yuma Federal Correctional Center.

40:10.238 --> 40:11.831
Hi. This is Grace Greenleaf.

40:12.774 --> 40:14.291
Hi. This is AJ.

40:21.249 --> 40:22.382
Are you there?

40:23.985 --> 40:25.469
Yeah, AJ...

40:27.322 --> 40:28.472
I'm here.

40:30.759 --> 40:33.070
So they got a halfway house
I can land in once I'm out,

40:33.094 --> 40:35.773
but it's just
a temporary situation, so...

40:35.797 --> 40:36.930
Two minutes.

40:40.535 --> 40:42.403
So, you know, I don't know.

40:43.538 --> 40:46.574
Well, you're gonna need money... hmm?

40:47.041 --> 40:47.952
Yeah.

40:47.976 --> 40:51.036
Yeah. And a... a permanent place to live.

40:52.213 --> 40:53.246
Yeah.

40:53.848 --> 40:55.583
Um, that's why you're calling, right?

40:58.019 --> 40:59.019
Yeah.

41:02.056 --> 41:03.841
Does Sophia know about me?

41:06.795 --> 41:07.994
That's her name, right?

41:08.563 --> 41:11.140
Mm-hmm. That's her name.

41:15.937 --> 41:17.771
So you gonna help me out or what?

41:20.308 --> 41:21.734
Yeah. I can help...

41:26.181 --> 41:27.280
And I want to.

41:30.285 --> 41:32.163
Okay. Cool. Thank you, bye.

41:37.258 --> 41:38.358
Bye.
