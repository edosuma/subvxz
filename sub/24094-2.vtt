WEBVTT

00:05.255 --> 00:06.535
I have the binders. Done.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.384
This is the idea that
we have figured out...

00:10.385 --> 00:13.472
Nobody cares about the
binders. That's what you did.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.558
You're right. You got the binders.
That's all you need to focus on.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.853
Yo! One at a time, I'm not following.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.608
Sorry, it's excitement.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.944
We've been chewing on
this the last two weeks.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.196
And it's finally time to
move forward with a plan.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.448
- A plan for what?
- Getting you out of the gang.

00:35.619 --> 00:36.619
You're serious?

00:37.037 --> 00:40.040
Oh, my gosh. No! No, no,
no, no. There is no out.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.435
You're being naive. Once you're
jumped in, you can't get out.

00:42.459 --> 00:46.213
Unless, you get jumped out, and
that's not, you know, an option.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.090
- Why not?
- They beat you till you die.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.758
- Oh, I see your dilemma.
- Yeah.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.052
Death isn't the only option. Ruby?

00:52.135 --> 00:54.513
So, after copious amounts of research,

00:54.596 --> 00:57.516
I've formulated a theory that
all great things come in threes:

00:57.975 --> 01:00.102
The Holy Trinity, primary colors,

01:00.602 --> 01:01.812
Destiny's Child...

01:01.895 --> 01:03.230
D.C. started with four members.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.649
But they weren't big
until they were three.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.651
Which is why there are
three common denominators

01:07.734 --> 01:09.987
to end any and all hostile situations.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.738
I call them the three M's.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.741
Money, murder, manipulation.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.955
No, not that one. They're watermarked.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.629
Clearly, murder's off the table.
The irony would be too much.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.382
There's no way we can hustle
up enough cash with a car wash

01:30.465 --> 01:32.342
- to make it worth Oscar's while.
- Unless...

01:32.426 --> 01:34.052
Jamal, don't. Please don't say it.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.431
Getting a lot of cash isn't
outside the realm of possibility.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.349
- What are you talking about?
- RollerWorld.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.727
It's real and 50K is still out there.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.650
The dudes that robbed
RollerWorld got put away,

01:43.729 --> 01:46.523
- but the money was never recovered.
- In the '80s.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.276
And the rumor's still rampant!
What about The Goonies?

01:49.776 --> 01:53.071
Some of those kids thought it was
B.S. until they found the treasure.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.490
- And they weren't even...
- Brown. We're brown.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.867
Only white kids find treasure.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.329
- True.
- What are you looking for?

02:01.204 --> 02:03.332
Baby Jesus. He's missing.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.500
The special one blessed by the bishop.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.336
I put him in here before I
started to move into my room.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.757
Dude, you're holding it.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.095
No, this is Toddler Jesus.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.807
Babies don't stand. This Jesus
is probably already potty trained.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.226
And this isn't a diaper,
these are booty shorts.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.317
Sit down. Sit.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.070
- All right, I'm out.
- We haven't even pitched the final M.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.279
Don't need to.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.866
- Manipulation.
- Through negotiation.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.951
With cogent,
well-articulated arguments.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.411
So, that's it? That's the plan?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.385
You're gonna get me out
of the gang with cogent,

02:43.386 --> 02:45.040
well-articulated arguments?

02:45.123 --> 02:47.959
- Yes.
- Never gonna happen. Good talk.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.258
So, that was the best
both of you could do?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.803
If you'd given me the
right binder the first time,

02:57.886 --> 03:00.647
then I probably would've handled
the conversation a little bit better.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.645
Cesar's reaction was a wake-up
call. The plan isn't fully formed.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.356
We need more time to let our ideas
marinate before we take action.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.483
Marinate? No. We got to cook now.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.402
The longer we wait,
the deeper Cesar's in.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.612
Right now he's got no responsibilities.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.823
We got to get him out
before he puts in work.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.534
Who's putting in work?
You still with that?

03:20.617 --> 03:21.618
- No.
- With what?

03:24.538 --> 03:25.997
- Jamal?
- We're still with it.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.375
This isn't funny anymore.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.138
Trying to reason with my brother's dumb.

03:30.139 --> 03:31.312
You gotta promise you're gonna drop it.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.336
- You're overreacting...
- Especially you. Promise.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.882
- I promise.
- Okay, good.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.342
See you after class.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.513
- So, who's gonna do it?
- Not Jamal.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.699
- I'll do it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.224
Your mouth is gonna get us killed.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.351
Yeah, Monse's a total no-go.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.978
So, that leaves me.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.816
- But it can't be me.
- It's you.

03:52.899 --> 03:53.984
You said it can't be me!

03:54.067 --> 03:57.696
I think this is up for discussion.
I mean, for starters, I'm small.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.615
There's nothing about me that's
even remotely intimidating

04:00.699 --> 04:02.993
and, actually, on numerous occasions,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.012
I've been told that just
looking at me makes people laugh.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.746
I also don't do anybody any favors

04:07.747 --> 04:09.000
by being the smartest
person in the room.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.675
And no one wants to feel dumb

04:10.676 --> 04:12.502
when they can't pick
up what I'm layin' down.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.796
- It's belittling. You follow?
- Hm-mmm.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.339
You see, this is what I'm talking about.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.801
I transcend the
universal plane of thought

04:19.885 --> 04:22.262
and linger on the precipice
of the celestial realm.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.264
I can't even keep up with myself.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.891
But it's who I am.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.977
But if all of that
isn't convincing enough,

04:29.060 --> 04:31.650
then dare I remind you
of my sensitive skin

04:31.651 --> 04:33.106
and inability to wear thick cotton.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.901
- What are you talking about?
- I can't hide my sweat.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.904
And I sweat profusely when I'm
nervous. Which I am right now.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.489
I mean, look, full clam.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.908
No shell. I rest my case.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.620
- Mmm.
- That was impressive.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.081
- So eloquent.
- Sold me on why he shouldn't do it.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.708
Which is exactly why he should!

04:51.792 --> 04:54.127
- Congratulations. You got the job.
- Again.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.299
Brilliance is a curse.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.015
Hey. Why're you being so nonchalant?

05:07.098 --> 05:08.558
Being a Santo is serious shit.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.478
Monse, you and I both know there
are plenty of people in the life

05:11.561 --> 05:12.813
that nothing happens to.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.346
They live and die and in between

05:14.347 --> 05:16.233
get a contact high and
a couple of tattoos.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.444
Save the BS for someone who's buying.
You're giving in without a fight.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.422
- You used to be a fighter.
- There's nothing to fight.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.824
Look, I got a reprieve when
my brother went to prison.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.219
I thought I could coast through
high school being affiliated

05:26.243 --> 05:28.119
and then disappear when we graduated.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.247
But Oscar got out early, so here I am.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.623
What if you disappear now?

05:32.707 --> 05:34.668
And go where, hmm? Do what?

05:34.751 --> 05:36.211
I'm in. It's done.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.134
I don't wanna live my life thinking
about dying, so I'm just gonna live.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.549
I'm sorry.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.093
I wasn't trying to rev up the
pressure. I was trying to help.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.303
I know. I appreciate it.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.598
- And there is something you can do.
- Anything.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.476
- If you want to help de-rev the pressure.
- Yeah.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.812
Meet me after school. Your room.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.855
Clothing's optional.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.193
Yo! I am all about this
"clothing's optional."

06:00.277 --> 06:01.455
How about we take this twosome,

06:01.456 --> 06:04.406
make it into a threesome,
and we can get some?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.658
- Hey!
-  ♪ Money, money, money ♪

06:06.741 --> 06:09.452
Damn. Jasmine's in demand. I'm
gonna check you guys later, okay?

06:09.536 --> 06:10.537
Bye!

06:11.788 --> 06:13.707
You need to stop talking about us.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.585
Didn't we decide to
pretend it didn't happen?

06:16.668 --> 06:19.713
Didn't we agree that dropping
our secret would screw up the fam?

06:19.796 --> 06:22.048
But some families are really close.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.925
Those families are from Louisiana.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.218
I know what you're doing.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.305
And attempting to bait and switch
my concern is not gonna work.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.432
You got to get serious. Hear me?

06:30.515 --> 06:31.515
I'm serious.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.060
And my window's always open.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.481
It'll never happen again.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.233
Never's a long time.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.194
- Unlike those two minutes.
- Two minutes? It was a solid five.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.279
Three max!

06:44.863 --> 06:47.324
Three? I'm pretty
sure that was lap four.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.231
Why are you still wearing
that fake neck brace?

06:49.232 --> 06:50.994
Your dad's nowhere in sight.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.872
It's not about my dad.
It's about muscle memory.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.249
The longer I wear it, the
more sore my neck feels

06:56.333 --> 06:57.602
and the more legit the injury looks.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.502
- So the brace is doing damage.
- No.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.253
Maybe.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.798
Crap, I didn't think about
that. What should I do?

07:03.882 --> 07:06.384
- No clue. And I've got other problems.
- Like what?

07:06.468 --> 07:08.242
I don't know. Like I
have to have a sit down

07:08.243 --> 07:09.471
with a cold-blooded gang leader

07:09.554 --> 07:10.865
and attempt to explain why his brother

07:10.889 --> 07:12.533
should be exempt from
the life he's living.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.237
How do you do that
without being insulting?

07:14.309 --> 07:16.811
- Or getting killed?
- Why would you say that?

07:16.895 --> 07:19.439
Look. Look, clear your mind, dude.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.565
Breathe.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.651
Margarita Ramirez, two o'clock.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.945
Come on! Give me the ball!

07:25.028 --> 07:26.780
Follow the bounce.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.283
Imagine you're riding that
wave of bounce up and down.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.869
It's washing over you
like a full body massage.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.247
I'm riding the wave. I'm bouncing.

07:36.831 --> 07:40.210
- Can I rub 'em down with sunscreen?
- No. No sunscreen.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.213
Baby oil. She likes to take risks.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.256
Mmm. And I can be dangerous.

07:46.257 --> 07:49.094
After school. -30.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.377
- For what?
- Practice.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.890
If it's not gonna be me talking
to Oscar, then we need a script.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.680
I've whittled down the primary arguments

07:55.681 --> 07:57.602
into talking points for obvious reasons.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.687
Which are obviously what?

07:58.770 --> 08:01.314
- That we don't want you to die.
- Breathe.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.942
- Follow the bounce.
- Don't worry. I'll dumb it down.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.528
What the hell was that?
She's not even in this class!

08:06.611 --> 08:09.948
Up and down. Look,
take a mental snapshot.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.792
Deposit it in your bank and then
make a withdrawal later in your room.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.745
My room. I forgot.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.998
I finally, finally have my own room!

08:19.082 --> 08:22.002
What do you mean I don't have
my own room? Abuelita moved out.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.546
She did. But your prima needs it now.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.589
Cousin? What cousin?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.508
My friend Rosa, her daughter.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.052
- Her parents were deported.
- So she's not even blood?

08:31.636 --> 08:34.431
Why can't she sleep with
the twins? Or on the couch?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.558
This is reverse sexism!

08:36.640 --> 08:38.476
I can sleep on the couch.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:47.235 --> 08:49.237
Mija, ignore Ruby.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.823
Ruben. I go by Ruben.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.146
Since when?

08:55.118 --> 08:57.746
Sorry about all that riffraff
you heard. Total misunderstanding.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.288
Mom?

09:07.297 --> 09:08.882
I was being insensitive.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.093
It'll be no problem to share a room.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.470
Ay, qué lindo.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.804
That's my boy.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.891
Oh, and no.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.851
You will be bunking with the twins.

09:20.852 --> 09:21.852
Ah.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.382
But it would be cruel and unusual

09:24.383 --> 09:26.400
to leave her alone in
this time of tragedy.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.027
No.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.738
Come on, I'm the man for the job.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.364
He's not the man for the job.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.658
We have to figure out the
work around. Like his diction.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.983
Sometimes I don't understand
half of what Ruby says.

09:37.984 --> 09:39.300
You know what I mean?

09:40.872 --> 09:42.874
- What?
- You're giving me a migraine.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.041
Think about how I feel.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.628
I have no time to teach Ruby
not to talk with his hands.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.296
He can't do that stuff with Oscar.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.466
Dudes gesticulate a lot in prison.
We don't want to remind him...

09:51.549 --> 09:52.567
- Hey.
- ... that...

09:52.750 --> 09:54.677
- Where you headed?
- Nowhere.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.222
Whatcha doing, Jamal?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.766
Decorating Ruby's room!

10:00.266 --> 10:01.946
- So there's no scheming?
- We're scheming.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.563
With color! Every good room
rehab needs a color scheme.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.691
I know a lot about the color
theory. I'll come along to help.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.360
You can drop me here, homie.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.202
Don't you have to go tag something?

10:19.911 --> 10:22.122
Nope.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.334
We're here to feng shui your
room! That's why we're here.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.670
I don't have my own room, but...

10:35.510 --> 10:38.012
I have a boner. My cousin just moved in.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.181
Not like my cousin cousin,

10:40.265 --> 10:42.058
like, "What's up, cuz?"

10:42.142 --> 10:43.601
You know, like fam, but not fam.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.271
Like if you can't keep it in
your pants, keep it in the family.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.314
Exactly! No.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.275
No, not exactly.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.693
There's no blood relation.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.736
There is no inbreeding.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.157
Oh, and call me Ruben.
I'm going by Ruben now.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.909
Ruby!

10:59.993 --> 11:00.994
Ruben.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.412
Are you forgetting something?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.623
Guys, this is Olivia.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.168
She's staying with us
for a little while. Okay?

11:12.046 --> 11:15.466
- Is it me or did things just get weird?
- It's you. I'm Monse.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.218
- This is Jamal and Cesar.
- Hey.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.178
Ignore the stares. They
haven't been neutered.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.600
- CHUCKLES]
- Jamal, why don't you tell Olivia

11:21.602 --> 11:23.016
what you didn't do to your neck.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.310
Ruby, can we discuss
our chem assignment?

11:28.646 --> 11:31.006
Act natural, look off to the
side so we don't seem scheme-y.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.545
Once you memorize the script, we'll
need three rehearsals. Minimum.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.155
Do Cesar's abs auto contract
or is he flexing on purpose?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.174
And you should check out the
diction tutorials on YouTube.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.093
I can't understand half of what
you're saying when you're nervous.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.453
- So, don't be nervous.
- I claimed her. This is bullshit.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.431
And remember, we've got to
keep it quiet from Cesar.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.623
This is a life-saving mission

11:46.706 --> 11:49.834
and keeping it on the down-low is
of the utmost importance. Got it?

11:50.209 --> 11:51.544
Good. Now be chill.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.963
You're hilarious.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.216
I'm saving Cesar!

12:02.931 --> 12:05.767
You know I'm not blessing
this, but Monse won't relent.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.645
And she absolutely cannot
be the one to do it.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.202
I think Oscar will go easiest on you,

12:10.203 --> 12:12.106
especially given his respect for Mario.

12:12.190 --> 12:16.069
But when you say he'll
go easy, what do you mean?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.404
I mean, he probably won't hurt you.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.032
Is there a good, like,
happy time for him?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.867
I mean, some people
aren't morning people.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.035
Do it before school.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.496
In a couple of days, a week?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.579
Tomorrow.

12:27.622 --> 12:30.583
He's expecting you.
Don't be late. Good night.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.667
Good night.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.309
- Hey.
-  It's a dumb idea.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.920
I was thinking the same.

12:49.921 --> 12:51.854
I'm kind of worried I
might be jacking up my neck.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.356
I'm talking about Oscar.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.317
I have an appointment with him
in the morning. Should I cancel?

12:56.401 --> 12:59.612
Hell no, you don't no-show on Oscar.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.198
Unless... Do you have a "go bag?"

13:02.281 --> 13:05.368
- A "go bag?"
- It's a bag you use when you need to go.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.371
You know, like with clothes,
cash, passport, zombie spray...

13:08.454 --> 13:10.192
No, I don't have a "go bag."

13:10.193 --> 13:12.000
I called you to talk
me down, not amp me up!

13:12.041 --> 13:15.086
- What's the worst that can happen?
- Right. I'm just having a conversation.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.462
With a hard ex-con.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.755
Who already has two strikes.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.049
Yeah. You save your strikes
for special occasions.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.384
You're not strike worthy.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.095
- Hey, I'm strike worthy.
- You don't wanna be.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.514
- Good point.
- He's not gonna kill you.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.891
- Thank you.
- But if he did, you'd be easy to hide.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.602
- Jamal!
- You'd probably fit in his "go bag."

13:35.398 --> 13:37.316
I need to unwind and
sleep before tomorrow,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.068
and now I'm gonna be up all night.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.154
You know how I get to
sleep when I'm all pent up?

13:41.237 --> 13:44.574
- Hit me.
- To sack out, I whack out.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.451
Not an option, I'm too distracted.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.827
It's the antidote, man.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.412
If anything happens to me...

13:49.495 --> 13:52.915
- I'll clean out your drawer.
- Appreciate that. Good night.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.374
Good luck.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.674
Hey.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.894
Un momento, espérate.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.103
Ah!

14:22.195 --> 14:23.195
Olivia.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.484
Sausage?

15:03.778 --> 15:05.029
Is it smoked?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.079
Don't you know I'm loco, ese.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.751
Button? No button?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.963
Oscar, I'm right here.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.768
Ruby! Mijo!

15:36.769 --> 15:38.604
Luis, stop glittering your sister!

15:40.398 --> 15:42.859
Ruby, I'm late! Get the twins dressed!

15:42.942 --> 15:45.653
I can't. I have a hard out at 7:55.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.495
Put the glitter down!
Put the glitter down!

15:55.204 --> 15:57.498
Put it down!

15:58.666 --> 16:00.835
That's insane! Houston sounds dope.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.087
You're one of those
cool girls, aren't you?

16:03.171 --> 16:04.338
I'm pretty basic.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.174
Said like the coolest of the cool.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.092
Oh, come on, you're no dork.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.677
Um, wrong. I am.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.680
I just have no filter 'cause I have
no gene for giving a damn, so...

16:12.763 --> 16:13.764
Neither do I.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.325
Want to hang after school?

16:15.326 --> 16:17.170
I'll show you the do's
and don'ts of our hood.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.228
No. Don't care.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.189
Me either.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.940
So, let's do it.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.328
- Um, give me a sec, I'll catch up.
- Mm-hmm.

16:28.988 --> 16:29.988
What's up?

16:30.448 --> 16:32.926
Ruby can't be the one to talk to
Oscar. He's the wrong messenger.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.471
No one should talk to Oscar, but
he's the best of the worst options.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.497
- I could...
- No. Oscar doesn't do badgering.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.580
I do...

16:38.915 --> 16:40.416
How am I badgering? I don't.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.655
Give me an example of how and
when I've done that before?

16:42.656 --> 16:43.670
You can't, can you?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.338
Olivia! Wait up!

16:53.721 --> 16:54.931
Ay, Santa María.

17:22.750 --> 17:23.750
Acid?

17:25.461 --> 17:28.256
I can't. I can't. I can't.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.389
'Sup, fool?

18:07.044 --> 18:08.296
What's with the glitter?

18:09.213 --> 18:12.508
Late night at the club.
You know how hynas be.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.095
I feel you, homie.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.931
Sometimes my ruca wears that same shit.

18:19.015 --> 18:22.143
She be rubbing all up on me. I
can't get the crap out for days.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.269
Women.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.521
Smoke?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.105
Trying to quit.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.944
Whatcha want to chop it up about?

18:32.695 --> 18:33.695
Um...

18:34.488 --> 18:35.488
Mr. Oscar...

18:36.282 --> 18:37.867
I mean, Spooky.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.537
I know you're a busy man,
so I'll cut right to it.

18:42.872 --> 18:43.872
Is that acid?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.209
You know what? Don't
answer. None of my business.

18:50.421 --> 18:54.216
So, Cesar. I mean, can we just
talk about how smart he is?

18:54.300 --> 18:57.970
You know, I'm smart, but he's
like... a certifiable genius.

18:58.429 --> 19:01.891
And he has off-the-charts emotional
intelligence, which is rare.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.351
I mean, combine that
with his innate ability

19:04.352 --> 19:06.395
to empathize and problem solve,

19:06.479 --> 19:07.980
and you get the real deal.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.440
A natural leader.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.110
Which is a testament to you
and how well you raised him.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.340
- I feel you, homie.
- So, what I'm saying is

19:16.341 --> 19:20.160
he has so much potential
that hasn't been realized.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.411
He's just a baby bird
waiting to take flight.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.997
Who knows how high that bird
can fly given the right wind

19:25.081 --> 19:26.999
and lack of avian predators.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.711
- I never looked at him that way.
- 'Cause he's not one to toot his own horn.

19:30.795 --> 19:34.006
Yet another one of his many attributes.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.633
You're right.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.636
He just needs to be given
that right opportunity,

19:39.470 --> 19:41.430
with good wind and no vultures and shit.

19:41.514 --> 19:47.019
Well, vultures are more like
scavengers. I was thinking hawks.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.562
Hawks can suck a dick!

19:49.480 --> 19:50.731
Exactly.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.735
I mean, you feelin' me, Spook. Spooky.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.278
Yeah. Mos def.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.572
You're opening my eyes, homes.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.241
That's what I do.

20:01.659 --> 20:02.659
You know...

20:04.120 --> 20:05.538
I will take that smoke.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.922
It's time to give Cesar his wings.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.730
You all right there?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.193
I did it! I did it!

20:36.986 --> 20:38.279
I mean, it's done.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.322
I rocked that talk hard.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.534
And for a guy named Spooky,
he's surprisingly jovial.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.828
- Wait, are you serious, Ruby?
- Ruben.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.330
And yes. Cesar's out the gang.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.833
Boom. Killed it.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.086
You did kill it. You killed
it so hard that I got promoted.

20:54.170 --> 20:57.006
No. Spooky and I had an understanding.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.067
Just got a text, gonna
start running for the Santos.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.470
No. No, no, no. That can't
be true. He must be joking.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.681
Compa, I love you for trying, but
like I said, this deal is done.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.099
And I don't blame you.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.267
I blame Monse.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.351
Me?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.371
Yeah, you're the instigator
and the frickin' honey badger.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.607
You don't quit. But now you
have to. No more. We're done.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.108
And so is "Ruben."

21:16.859 --> 21:19.069
I'm not man enough to bear that name.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.909
Hey, you're a man.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.037
Don't look at me like that.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.432
This wasn't a one-woman show.
We all came up with the plan.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.291
I know it was you. All you.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.001
You should make it up to me.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.504
Oh, I can make it up to you, papi.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.923
Just gotta make it fast.
Jasmine has other offers.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.486
- Take the other offers.
- Yeah, okay.

21:41.592 --> 21:44.804
You need to stop. That thing
that's not a thing is over.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.555
What's wrong with Ruby?

21:46.639 --> 21:49.039
He's fine. He's just still
bummed he had to give up his room.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.595
- Am I interrupting something?
- Nope. Nothing.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.918
- Sorry, not trying to be weird.
- But she can't help it.

21:57.942 --> 21:58.943
Ah.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.447
- So, after school, you wanna hang?
- Wanna hang?

22:01.487 --> 22:04.448
- Oh, I have plans with Monse.
- Oh, I'm happy to join.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.950
It's kind of a girl thing.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.868
Oh, can I watch?

22:09.411 --> 22:11.747
- I got to get to class.
- Great. Bye.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.626
Just text me when you
get out of sixth period.

22:15.709 --> 22:16.709
Okay.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.297
I'm sorry I wasn't talking to you.
Let me give you my number, Olivia.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.469
- Is that a problem?
- No, why would that be a problem?

22:45.823 --> 22:46.823
Hey.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.033
Hey.

22:48.576 --> 22:49.577
How's it going?

22:51.745 --> 22:52.955
Your friends are really cool.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.624
Monse gave me a tour and
Cesar could not be any nicer.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.420
Yeah, he's a great
dude. He's the best dude.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.672
He's better than me.

23:05.426 --> 23:08.762
Sorry. I don't want to be
rude, but I got to finish this.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.442
Could you take a break for a sec?

23:36.332 --> 23:38.250
I know how much you've wanted this.

23:38.834 --> 23:39.918
Uh...

23:40.628 --> 23:41.670
You know?

23:42.296 --> 23:45.299
- I knew since the minute I met you.
- You did?

23:45.382 --> 23:46.759
I did.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.096
So it's yours. Just... take it.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.098
How do I take it?

23:53.641 --> 23:54.975
My family's right outside.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.936
Shoot. Right. We need a plan.
We got to explain why we did it.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.188
We have to tell them?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.940
- Yeah, it's gonna be obvious.
- It is? Are you sure?

24:02.024 --> 24:03.734
It feels weird to include them.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.588
Now I'm not second guessing you.
It's just I've never done this before.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.614
I'll stop talking.
I'll follow your lead.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.493
So, should I take my clothes
off or do you want to do that?

24:12.576 --> 24:13.827
I should take them off.

24:13.911 --> 24:16.455
I don't know if I know
what you're talking about.

24:16.538 --> 24:20.042
Uh... what are you talking about?

24:21.126 --> 24:24.713
I want to give you your room
back and I'll bunk with the twins.

24:25.589 --> 24:29.885
Oh! Oh, my room! Yes, my
room! I love that idea.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.888
And yes, we need a solid
plan, like bulletproof.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.890
No room for holes or my abuelita,

24:34.973 --> 24:36.183
'cause she's no joke.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.977
Neither are my parents. They're
not gonna be easy to convince.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.313
I know the kind.

24:55.494 --> 25:00.708
You know, I was too hasty.
I don't want the room back.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.461
Seriously, it's drafty
and I hate blankets.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.339
It's also really close to the
bathroom, and you can hear everything.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.968
And I actually like my new digs.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.052
Plus...

25:19.518 --> 25:20.644
this looks good here.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.025
I know what you're doing.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.777
I'm not doing anything.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.493
Thank you, Ruben.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.583
Mmm.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.048
♪ What's that love? ♪

25:50.132 --> 25:51.550
♪ What's that sound? ♪

25:51.633 --> 25:54.928
♪ That's my love dying for you... ♪

25:58.348 --> 25:59.475
What's up?

25:59.558 --> 26:03.103
The plan to talk to Oscar wasn't
all me. We strategized as a team.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.980
Okay. I heard you the first time.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.523
I wasn't the instigator.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.650
- Got it.
- Wanted to make sure you knew that.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.986
- Loud and clear.
- And I'm not a honey badger.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.155
Whatever you say. Good night.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.242
- Yes?
- Are you sure you're sure?

26:17.701 --> 26:18.701
About what?

26:19.144 --> 26:20.162
What I said.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.539
- Yeah, you aren't the instigator.
- Right.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.249
That all?

26:25.042 --> 26:26.376
Yep.

26:26.460 --> 26:29.254
Really? 'Cause you could've
just sent that in a text.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.674
No. Tone is never properly
conveyed through text.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.343
Ah.

26:37.221 --> 26:40.307
- What?
- Olivia's really pretty, isn't she?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.017
I guess. I haven't noticed.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.604
Mmm. Right. Got it. Good night.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.529
I don't know what you "got," but
don't flatter yourself, Cesar.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.240
This has nothing to do with jealousy.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.116
Don't walk away from me!

27:13.215 --> 27:14.800
Yes?
