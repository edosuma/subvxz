00:53.220 --> 00:55.314
For two? Right this way.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.191
- Is this okay?
- This is great. Thank you.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.728
Your menus.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.076
Thank you so much.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.458
You must get asked to
do this all the time.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.414
You know. You've been there.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.329
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.839
Well, I really appreciate it.

01:20.998 --> 01:25.051
So... what do you think?

01:25.210 --> 01:28.305
Look, I wouldn't be helping you

01:28.463 --> 01:29.840
if I didn't tell you the truth.

01:30.007 --> 01:33.477
To get an agent here, you're gonna
need to get a new portfolio.

01:33.635 --> 01:38.682
Your photos feel very...
Midwestern.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.851
Yeah, of course.

01:41.018 --> 01:44.192
Can you recommend a
good photographer?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.152
Well, yeah, sure,

01:46.315 --> 01:48.534
but they don't come cheap.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.992
You're looking at a couple
of grand for one session.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.866
<i>Okay</i> '

01:56.033 --> 01:58.377
Listen, you have a look.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.162
You have poise.

02:00.329 --> 02:03.674
I noticed you the first day
that you started working here.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.834
You just need to
get that on film

02:06.001 --> 02:09.722
with a little more style
than what's in here.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.258
I get it.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.557
Katie.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.393
Look, I need to
get back to work.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.018
Keep me posted, yeah?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.153
Definitely.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.408
- Have a good evening.
- Yeah, see you, Katie.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.887
- See you tomorrow, guys.
- Thanks a lot. See you tomorrow.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.757
Eh. Where'd you go,
you little shit.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.044
Come on. Show yourself.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.632
Come on!

03:31.795 --> 03:33.797
Show yourself!

03:37.592 --> 03:39.515
Fuck!

03:39.678 --> 03:41.521
Jesus!

03:41.680 --> 03:44.308
Fuck!

03:44.474 --> 03:46.192
Damn!

03:46.351 --> 03:48.103
Ah!

03:48.270 --> 03:50.648
- Hey, Jayson.
- Oh, hey.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.487
How's it going?

03:52.649 --> 03:55.118
I think he's long gone.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.121
What? How'd you know?

03:58.280 --> 04:00.578
He nearly knocked me
over on the way in.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.119
Probably hailed a
cab uptown by now.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.081
You know, some years
are worse than others.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.047
It's rats. It's New York.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.632
Sort of is what it is.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.012
What are you doing?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.762
Setting a trap that will work.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.234
Huh.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.273
Okay, a little hobby of yours?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.534
I know how to catch
me some vermin.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.909
Vermin?

04:37.068 --> 04:40.288
Yup. Learned a lot down
on the farms of Missouri.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.541
- Are you aiming for my job, Katie?
- You betcha.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.168
Well, I'm not gonna
mess with you.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.704
Hope not.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.872
I got it. I'll
clean up the rest.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.212
Let me know how it works out.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.719
You know, if it works, you're gonna
have to teach me how to do it.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.724
It'll work and I accept
cash, jewelry...

04:58.882 --> 05:01.055
- How 'bout beer?
- Deal.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.061
I still need to fix that dimmer.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.643
Already took care of it.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.122
Hello. You are calling
for photo shoot, yes?

06:08.285 --> 06:12.794
Yeah, I was just, um...
You are model?

06:12.956 --> 06:14.299
Hello?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.004
Um, yeah.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.511
Great. Text picture
to us now, please.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.638
Excuse me?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.720
You want free photos,

06:22.883 --> 06:24.977
we need certain look
for our portfolio.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.638
You know, for promotion.
This is how it works.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.353
Oh. Who am I talking to?

06:30.515 --> 06:32.108
I'm Ivan.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.440
Your name is Katie, I
see here on my phone.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.981
Yes, that's right. Katie.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.991
Nice to meet you, Katie.
Now, please, text picture.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.902
- Thank you.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.947
<i>Okay</i> '

07:19.689 --> 07:22.408
Yeah, here it is. Just
drop me by the door.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.097
Hello?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.915
Great. That's beautiful.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.620
And smile.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.666
Okay. Turn around.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.955
Can I help you?

08:17.122 --> 08:18.499
Katie.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.259
I have an appointment at 10 A.M.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.005
Miss Katie, of course.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.299
Ivan.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.763
- Ivan.
- What?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.428
Miss Katie's here.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.892
My next appointment's here.
We're done.

08:34.054 --> 08:37.025
Katie.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.231
- Yeah.
- We spoke on the phone.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.897
- You are much prettier than picture.
- Thank you.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.236
Guess that's why I'm here.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.242
Yes.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.369
You brought some clothes?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.622
Yeah. Uh...

08:54.242 --> 08:56.119
<i>Okay</i> '

08:56.286 --> 08:57.287
Nah.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.048
No. No.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.631
Ah. This one.

09:03.793 --> 09:07.639
Georgy. Georg!

09:07.797 --> 09:11.051
Yeah. It's cool.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.686
Great. Where do I get changed?

09:13.845 --> 09:15.347
Right here.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.481
We are all professionals, no?

09:20.393 --> 09:23.818
I'm joking. In the back.
Georgy will show you.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.108
Where is other girl?

09:26.274 --> 09:29.027
Nicky, go back to sleep.
Do not hurt yourself.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.447
And, please, um...

09:31.613 --> 09:34.537
- do not forget photo release form.
- Sure.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.167
- This way.
- Go.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.749
<i>Okay</i> '

09:38.912 --> 09:40.789
- Nicky.
- What, man?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.832
Off the box.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.761
Hey, will you help me with this?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.771
Of course.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.693
Thanks.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.198
How do I look?

10:07.357 --> 10:08.904
Like dream.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.195
Let's hope the
pictures say the same.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.208
Um... look at me. Good.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.668
Tilt down a bit.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.430
Yes, yes.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.840
To me, to me.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.391
Now down the lens.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.727
On the model, Georgy.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.855
Hmm.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.779
Is everything okay?

10:53.945 --> 10:55.947
Yeah, it's perfection, yeah.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.867
Maybe something different, huh?

11:01.244 --> 11:03.417
The long lens, please.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.966
Do you want me to try
a different dress?

11:07.125 --> 11:12.131
Maybe. Maybe, um...
maybe try more...

11:12.297 --> 11:14.015
skin.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.144
You know, something
sexy and sensual.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.431
Something a little
more lower cut.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.850
Yeah, maybe, but, please,

11:23.016 --> 11:25.940
maybe try take this
one down a bit.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.857
This one doesn't come down.
It's either on or off.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.276
Oh.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.194
Maybe off, then?

11:34.360 --> 11:37.405
You know... No.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.290
I don't know.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.453
No? It's nothing. Listen.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.793
A lot of girls to get
different jobs, they...

11:45.955 --> 11:48.925
they show a little more.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.302
Especially in Europe.
It's normal.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.429
I'm sorry.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.717
I didn't... that's not
what I was expecting.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.476
Oh, she wasn't expecting.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.809
And what is it you
were expecting?

12:01.971 --> 12:04.599
You are a model. You
are professional.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.564
I'm not gonna take
my clothes off

12:06.726 --> 12:08.603
so you can sell the
photos on the Internet.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.774
If that's what you guys want, we
have a real misunderstanding.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.487
She's fucking prude.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.243
Shut up, Nicky.

12:15.401 --> 12:21.833
But, um... you want
free photos, yes?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.834
Not that bad. Sorry.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.995
I'm outta here.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.045
Waste of time.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.346
Listen to me for a second.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.761
I don't wanna listen to you!

12:40.927 --> 12:43.271
I'm tired of listening
to you every day!

12:43.429 --> 12:46.979
I rolled out of this house
at 4:30 in the morning.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.984
You were still lying
right here asleep.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.942
Oh, let me get a thousand
violins to play for you.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.699
I didn't do anything all day
long, what's wrong with you...

12:58.319 --> 12:59.866
Look at this place,

13:00.029 --> 13:01.781
it's a fucking disaster!

13:04.867 --> 13:07.336
Don't you start with me!
Don't you start with me!

13:07.495 --> 13:10.840
I work all fucking day, I gotta
put up with all this stuff!

13:10.999 --> 13:13.127
When I come home, I want
a fucking hot meal.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.795
Is that so difficult
for you to understand?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.554
- What's wrong with you?!

13:16.713 --> 13:18.010
You are what is wrong with me!

13:18.172 --> 13:20.516
No wonder we live in
a fucking pigsty!

13:44.824 --> 13:46.997
Who is it?

13:51.622 --> 13:53.249
Hello, Miss Katie.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.635
What are you doing here?

13:55.793 --> 13:57.636
I come bring your pictures.

13:57.795 --> 14:01.049
I don't want those.
I told you that.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.264
I know... because you
were very upset.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.431
But I do this favor for you.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.315
I'm not bad guy.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.818
And I'm not upset.
Now, please.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.274
The pictures are great.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.439
You can use them.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.367
Okay, okay. I got them.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.744
Really, I appreciate it, I do.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.951
Now, I have work to do.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.663
What is with attitude?

14:27.825 --> 14:29.452
Look,

14:29.619 --> 14:31.217
I know you're trying to
do something nice...

14:31.230 --> 14:32.839
make up for your brother,

14:32.997 --> 14:36.297
- but I assure you, it's okay.
- Okay, then.

14:36.459 --> 14:40.305
And I wiped all the pictures off
the drives for your privacy.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.386
Thank you. That
was really nice.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.471
I appreciate it.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.307
Thanks, Georgy.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.392
I hope this helps.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.852
- Have a nice day.
- Okay, bye.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.392
Miss Katie.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.799
What are you doing?!

17:25.962 --> 17:27.509
You're so nice.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.640
So beautiful. Come, sit down.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.891
We'll talk.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.475
In three seconds, I'm
gonna scream so loud.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.356
Why are you doing this
after all I did for you?

17:37.515 --> 17:39.438
Leave now.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.477
Please, come, sit down.

17:41.644 --> 17:42.691
We'll talk.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.334
Help!

18:17.138 --> 18:18.936
- Ah!

18:35.698 --> 18:38.201
Shut up. Shut up.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.744
Shut up.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.233
Don't move.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.282
Stop moving.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.081
Stop moving.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.795
Stop moving! Stop moving.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.630
Shut up and don't move.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.428
Stop moving. Stop moving.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.191
- Katie? Katie?!

19:51.357 --> 19:53.325
Are you okay? I'm coming in.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.861
I'm coming in!

19:55.027 --> 19:57.280
Katie?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.333
Oh, my God, Katie.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.999
Tell me that you like me.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.667
Tell me that you like me.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.457
Say I like you, Georgy.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.921
<i>“Mm?</i>

20:56.046 --> 20:57.673
I like you, Georgy.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.184
Say that you like me.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.143
I like you, Georgy.
I like you, Georgy.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.900
I like you, Georgy.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.243
That's not necessary.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.581
You will like this.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.084
I'm sure... I'm sure
you'll like this.

21:33.250 --> 21:37.050
Be cool... be cool.
You will like this.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.405
I knew you'd like it.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.162
Tell me that you like me.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.294
You like it, I know.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.585
I know that you like it.
You like it!

22:15.751 --> 22:17.799
Say that you like it.

22:17.962 --> 22:20.761
Say it. Say it.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.925
Yeah, you like it.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.464
Bro, I fucked up again.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.930
Yeah.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.560
I fucked up.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.561
Yeah.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.563
On the sixth, yeah.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.245
Whoa.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.287
Holy shit, bro.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.088
She hit me with the Taser gun.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.701
Put these on.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.458
Here. Take.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.970
- Nice job.
- He just came in.

25:50.132 --> 25:53.136
- He was not supposed to be here.
- And you were?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.648
You know what this means, right?

26:05.814 --> 26:09.034
Do you know what this means?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.325
I know. I'm sorry.

26:12.488 --> 26:15.742
- Shh.
- We can clean this place up.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.785
It goes away. It goes away.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.500
We have calls from
her to the studio.

26:20.662 --> 26:23.586
We have dead lover boy
on the floor here.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.592
You have your prints
all over this place.

26:25.751 --> 26:29.176
<i>Do you have your
'gunk inside her'?</i>

26:31.882 --> 26:35.557
- Yeah.
- There is no cleaning this up.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.818
Do you have your ketamine?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.857
Yes.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.371
Good.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.366
Give it to me.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.713
Now give me the knife.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.839
The knife. Knife!

27:10.712 --> 27:13.386
Hey! Hands.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.723
Touch it. Touch it.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.560
Touch it.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.190
Good girl.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.569
Get paper towel and cleaner

27:33.735 --> 27:37.035
and wipe down everything
you have touched.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.457
You know, you are
one sick fuck.

27:42.619 --> 27:46.089
You know that? You
are one sick fuck.

27:46.248 --> 27:49.627
And you're so perfect?

27:49.793 --> 27:52.967
We are never cleaning up
after me, though, are we?

27:55.591 --> 27:58.094
Father is going
to love this one.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.103
Please, don't tell him.

28:00.262 --> 28:03.641
Please, bro. Father
doesn't need to know.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.696
Please...

28:15.986 --> 28:17.408
forgive my brother.

28:17.571 --> 28:20.120
He cannot help himself.

28:20.282 --> 28:24.537
But we all have our vices, eh?

28:32.711 --> 28:35.134
Open. Open.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.550
Come here, come here.
Open. Open!

28:41.136 --> 28:43.264
Open.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.187
Yes.

28:58.028 --> 28:59.701
Shut up. Swallow it.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.044
Good night, Katie.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.171
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.678
Shh.

29:23.637 --> 29:26.015
Now, Nicky, go get the box.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.922
Stop. Stop!

30:38.170 --> 30:41.424
Stop!

30:47.763 --> 30:49.982
Come on, come on! You junkie!

30:50.140 --> 30:51.312
- What the fuck, man?!

30:53.852 --> 30:57.197
She doesn't even know what's happening.
She's wasted.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.540
All right. You still in
the K-hole, darling?

31:18.627 --> 31:20.470
Do you know your name?

31:20.629 --> 31:22.381
It's just a dream, see.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.800
One bad fucking dream.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.651
Water.

31:36.311 --> 31:38.029
She speaks, man.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.825
I'm thirsty, please.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.246
- I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty?

31:46.405 --> 31:47.657
Yeah.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.915
Drink up, baby. It's
refreshing, isn't it?

31:58.542 --> 31:59.714
Hey, bro!

32:04.673 --> 32:06.846
Stop it! The both of you.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.596
He was pissing on her!

32:10.762 --> 32:12.730
Is that so?

32:12.889 --> 32:15.688
What's the difference?
She's a piece of trash.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.026
Upstairs!

32:21.648 --> 32:23.150
Now!

32:32.159 --> 32:33.957
You might want to get
some sleep, yeah?

32:39.875 --> 32:41.877

33:56.368 --> 33:58.962
What do you want from me?!

33:59.120 --> 34:00.713
I want you to wash yourself.

screaming all over the place

34:19.139 --> 34:20.813

40:37.602 --> 40:41.573
Everything will be fine.

40:41.731 --> 40:44.405
Georgy, you finished playing
house with your girlfriend?

40:44.567 --> 40:46.069
Fuck, man.

40:51.741 --> 40:55.712
Ivan! Ivan!

40:58.998 --> 41:02.093
I say it again, you
need to see doctor.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.673
I'll take you to clinic.

41:03.836 --> 41:05.930
No one's going to touch me.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.300
I just wanna go home.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.061
Yeah, first, I finish report.

41:13.388 --> 41:15.891
So three men broke
into your apartment

41:16.057 --> 41:17.730
in New York.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.690
I've told you already.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.901
Forgive me, this is
a strange story.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.783
Story?

41:27.193 --> 41:29.662
These men, you knew them?

41:29.821 --> 41:31.823
No.

41:31.990 --> 41:35.085
I've told you already. You
should be looking for them.

41:37.245 --> 41:40.374
You're hurt, but you
won't see doctor.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.884
I think you take drugs.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.840
That's why you refuse doctor

41:45.003 --> 41:47.802
because drugs show up in test.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.681
I wanna go to the
American Embassy now.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.688
I'm not gonna answer
anymore of your questions

41:55.847 --> 41:58.145
unless you're gonna
charge me with something.

42:02.729 --> 42:03.901
Hello.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.783
Please, let's speak English.

refuses to see doctor.

My dear, dear, girl.

My name is Ana.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.823
You are Katie?

42:54.155 --> 42:56.123
I run a shelter.

42:56.282 --> 42:58.705
I help women who
have been hurt.

42:58.868 --> 43:01.872

Are you hungry?

43:19.430 --> 43:21.853
I'm not hungry.

43:24.018 --> 43:26.362
I wanna go to the Embassy now.

I have same experience.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.039

We get you some clothes.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.093
Maybe you want shower.

43:49.252 --> 43:51.721
Then we go to Embassy.

43:51.879 --> 43:54.598
But first, we get
you out of here.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.774
Hello. My name is Ana Patov.

<i>Okay</i> '

44:17.238 --> 44:18.831

44:21.075 --> 44:22.577
I must warn you,

44:22.743 --> 44:25.087
you don't just go on plane.

44:25.246 --> 44:27.089
They make report,

44:27.248 --> 44:29.376
ask questions, make
sure who you are.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.636
It takes time.

44:33.838 --> 44:36.341
I can give you
clothes and money.

44:37.758 --> 44:39.601
Money is what you need most.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.773
My house is near Embassy.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.026
Very close.

44:47.185 --> 44:51.281
We can stop for

47:05.489 --> 47:06.786
You think this hurts?

47:06.949 --> 47:08.792
You just wait.

47:10.286 --> 47:12.254
Just wait.

48:02.338 --> 48:04.432
Please, don't hurt me.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.308
Hold still.

48:45.714 --> 48:47.557
You want to move, yes?

48:47.716 --> 48:50.560
Come, I make you...

49:03.399 --> 49:04.901
Pain is good, yes?

49:05.067 --> 49:07.991
You like this, yes?

49:15.077 --> 49:18.081
Open or I shock your face.

49:41.520 --> 49:44.899
Pain wakes the body.

49:46.108 --> 49:50.113
Makes everything feel better.

49:51.780 --> 49:54.283
You understand my English?

50:05.711 --> 50:07.463
Now you move.

50:09.465 --> 50:11.968
Move or I shock you.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.768
No!

51:18.867 --> 51:20.869
I'm done.

51:38.846 --> 51:40.519
You all right, bro?

52:01.493 --> 52:03.245
<i>HEY '.</i>

52:05.831 --> 52:07.128
<i>HEY '.</i>

52:11.712 --> 52:12.759
<i>HEY '.</i>

52:25.017 --> 52:26.644
Don't worry.

52:26.810 --> 52:29.780
I wouldn't fuck you with
Nicky's dick right now.

52:29.938 --> 52:31.986
You're disgusting.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.947
You should see yourself, Katie.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.736
You're not so pretty.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.496
You're not so proud.

52:46.121 --> 52:48.044
You want to touch me?

52:51.043 --> 52:53.137
Good. Good.

52:55.381 --> 52:57.679
I will touch you, too.

53:07.101 --> 53:09.229
It's deep enough.

53:09.395 --> 53:10.817
You could put a truck down here.

53:10.979 --> 53:13.073
Shut up. Keep digging.

53:22.491 --> 53:24.914
I've hit rock.

53:25.077 --> 53:26.670
Solid rock.

53:26.829 --> 53:28.797
I can't dig anymore, man.

53:30.165 --> 53:32.167
It's deep enough.

53:32.334 --> 53:34.837
Let's get her in.

53:40.008 --> 53:41.635
Katie.

53:41.802 --> 53:45.102
The box is ready for you now.

53:45.264 --> 53:47.517
You remember it, yes?

54:08.036 --> 54:10.164
You're a sick fuck.

54:11.373 --> 54:14.752
No, Georgy is a sick fuck.

54:14.918 --> 54:17.637
I'm not. He's a
crazy, sick fuck.

54:17.796 --> 54:21.221
Nicolai is just sick.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.602
Me?

54:23.761 --> 54:25.809
I'm just fuck.

54:29.641 --> 54:33.396
And you think that if you take
your clothes off for me...

54:34.646 --> 54:38.241
in New York... none
of this would happen.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.903
Maybe, yes?

54:42.905 --> 54:44.077
Go.

54:55.083 --> 54:58.257
Here you go, bro. A present.

54:58.420 --> 55:00.093
<i>Let's go.</i>

55:13.435 --> 55:14.482
There.

55:22.903 --> 55:24.780
Wait.

55:32.246 --> 55:34.465
Goodbye, Miss Katie.

55:38.293 --> 55:40.136
If you want, we put
you in the box, too.

55:40.295 --> 55:42.468
- You can be together.
- Fuck off.

55:43.632 --> 55:45.350
Hold on. Hold on.

56:06.613 --> 56:09.867
<i>No, “O, no, no, no, no.</i>

56:10.033 --> 56:14.209
Please, God, don't
do this to me.

56:39.521 --> 56:41.194
Now, put it.

56:52.659 --> 56:54.411
Help me.

56:54.578 --> 56:56.205
Please.

56:56.371 --> 56:58.089
God, help me.

57:01.585 --> 57:05.761
Don't let me die, please.

57:07.257 --> 57:09.180
Not down here.

57:09.343 --> 57:11.061
Not like this.

57:12.304 --> 57:13.977
Not down here and
not like this.

57:14.139 --> 57:15.891
Not down here and
not like this.

57:16.058 --> 57:18.277
Not down here and
not like this.

57:18.435 --> 57:21.063
Not down here and
not like this!

57:55.764 --> 57:57.766
Mama.

58:22.624 --> 58:24.626
So maybe we go out tonight, huh?

58:24.793 --> 58:26.466
Celebrate.

58:27.629 --> 58:30.178
Come on, Ivan.

58:30.340 --> 58:32.638
It's finish. We have some
fun before we go back, huh?

58:32.801 --> 58:35.975
We're never going back.

58:36.138 --> 58:39.312
- What?
- We can't go back, ever.

58:39.474 --> 58:43.069
Is too risky. Thank Georgy.

58:44.146 --> 58:47.241
Need to lie low. Split up.

58:47.399 --> 58:50.448
Go stay one of
your bitches, huh?

58:50.610 --> 58:53.784
Why?

58:53.947 --> 58:58.043
She talked to the police. Is all
of your brain gone, Nicolai?

59:01.913 --> 59:04.712
Where is he, anyway?
Crying over girlfriend?

59:08.670 --> 59:10.889
I'll make him cry.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.927
Fucking asshole.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.459
Hello?

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:31.170
Hello?

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.624
Help!

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:45.160
Can anyone hear me?

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:27.886
Stay away from me.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:30.222
Oh, are you American?

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.979
Don't come near me.

01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.398
You have no need to fear me.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:38.356
You're English is good.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:42.568
Oh, I study philosophy in London.
Your English is better.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:50.951
A young American girl

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:54.414
scurrying around
underneath of here...

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:56.078
why?

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:57.791
This I would like to hear.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.752
Please, come and sit. Eat.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:01.712
No, thank you.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.548
Don't be foolish.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.428
I want to help you.

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:07.635
I don't need help.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.175
<i>Okay</i> '

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:12.435
Take the clothes,

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:15.097
take the shoes, and the food.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.766
You do not need to steal.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.051
Little mouse.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.224
I'm pleased to find you here.

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.689
No closer.

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:15.986
Someone did very bad
things to you, I know.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.452
I can call the police.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.492
Don't.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:31.004
You can't run from this forever.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.799
I'm not running.

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:15.711
Merci, merci.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.349
Hello?

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.304
Katie?

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.523
Katie?

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:18.853
Katie?

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:40.667
Father, tell me,
what could not wait?

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.506
There is a woman.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:45.888
A vagrant. I think
she needs help.

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:47.765
She's American.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:49.016
- American?
- Mm.

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:54.105
I believe she has come into
the worst kind of abuse.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:58.401
- Like what?
- I don't even want to imagine.

01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:00.232
I gave her some food,
some clothes, and...

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:02.396
What can I do?

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.281
I'm worried.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.943
I'm afraid she's about to
do something terrible.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:10.363
- Terrible?
- Yes.

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:15.539
This is the Bible I gave to her.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.669
She left it open.

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.756
"Vengeance is mine;

01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:23.964
I will repay, saith the Lord."

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:26.299
This American, what
does she look like?

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.432
In her early 20s.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.763
About this high.

01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:34.896
She weighs about as much
as a leaf dripping wet.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:38.850
She has long brown hair and...

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.236
she's beautiful.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:45.820
Father, what do you think
this woman is capable of?

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:49.407
I've been asking myself
the same question.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:07.336
Please, Katie, release me.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.130
Please.

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:11.640
It's okay.

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:13.392
It's okay, Georgy.

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:16.851
I'm going to take
good care of you.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:22.644
No. No.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.404
You like me now, yes?

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:27.486
Yes.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:33.329
This feels good, yes?

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:37.825
Shh.

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:46.338
I could castrate you.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.594
No, "O, please."

01:15:55.634 --> 01:16:00.014
Or I could slit your throat.

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:02.650
But you are a sick

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:05.527
and diseased bag of flesh

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:08.485
and that is how you
deserve to die.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:12.823
Rotting like you left me.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:26.882
If I were you, I'd get
some antibiotics.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:30.011
Wouldn't want infection
to set in, would we?

01:16:32.379 --> 01:16:34.347
Why are you doing this?

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.724
Please, don't do this.

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:40.479
Please, Katie.

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:42.265
No, no.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.274
No, please.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.691
I'm making you look pretty.

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:58.493
Real... <i>pretty .</i>

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:01.500
No, please.

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:16.640
Katie! Katie!

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:27.776
American Embassy, please.

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:30.358
Thank you.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:24.885
Still in the K-hole, darling?

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.726
You don't even know
what's happening, do you?

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:30.061
We killed you.

01:19:30.224 --> 01:19:32.352
Yeah.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:35.317
See, this is all a dream!

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:46.415
One... bad... fucking... dream!

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:48.575
Are you thirsty?

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.921
Take a big drink.

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:58.044
Second course.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:59.427
No, no!

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:01.259
Put it in your
mouth and swallow.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:04.346
You know how to swallow,
don't you, darling?!

01:20:04.508 --> 01:20:06.761
Don't you?!

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:31.512
Fucking whore. Katie,
you fucking whore.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:36.559
Help!

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:40.104
Help! Help!

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:44.025
Help! Help!

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:47.195
No one can hear you down here.

01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:49.204
Scream all you want.

01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:51.161
It ain't gonna work.

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:54.042
Trust me, I tried.

01:22:06.964 --> 01:22:08.887
You like me now, don't you?

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:10.642
I'm sorry, Miss Katie.

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:12.553
Answer me.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.946
Tell me you like me.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.692
Tell me! Tell me!

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:31.864
- Tell me you like me.
- I like you.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.916
I like you. I like you.

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:41.252
I like you, Katie.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:49.765
I like... I like you, Katie.
I like you, Katie.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:51.425
I like you...

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.446
Suck on that.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.857
You.

01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:48.675
Please... don't do this.

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:08.858
Now... you move or I shock you.

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:21.329
You like electricity, don't you?

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:37.932
What are you doing?

01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:47.067
Please... I beg of you.

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:50.562
No more!

01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:56.318
No more?

01:25:56.485 --> 01:26:00.035
I haven't even gotten started.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.575
Open.

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:18.591
A little foreplay.

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.139
Right?

01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:31.487
Is the pain waking
your body up yet?

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:28.581
They used to use shock therapy
to help the mentally ill.

01:27:32.038 --> 01:27:36.627
Since you are so
sick, you, Valko,

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:39.467
need a great deal of therapy.

01:29:30.407 --> 01:29:31.750
No.

01:30:13.325 --> 01:30:15.373
Boo.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.199
My dear girl.

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:48.531
Believe me,

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:50.411
I know what you're
going through.

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:04.918
No!

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:07.759
NO! Oh, no!

01:31:07.921 --> 01:31:09.138
Please!

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:10.970
No!

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.009
Please!

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:15.053
No!

01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:19.266
No!

01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:21.776
Please!

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:26.614
Ana, I must talk to you.

01:31:26.773 --> 01:31:28.446
Ana.

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:37.659
No. No.

01:31:43.123 --> 01:31:44.796
Aha?

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:51.468
What the fuck?

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:55.593
Aha?

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.648
I must talk to her.

01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:02.559
The American.

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:04.694
How do I find her?

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:08.278
Do you know her? Who is she?

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.068
Katie. Her name is Katie.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:14.488
She came to me for
help not too long ago.

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:19.951
And did you help her?

01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:21.916
I thought so.

01:32:22.078 --> 01:32:25.457
Now I'm not so sure.

01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:51.991
So she's down there.

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:53.993
Help her.

01:32:58.281 --> 01:32:59.999
This time, you must
help her, Kiril.

01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:02.502
Ana?

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:11.469
My God.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:20.516
Georgy. Georgy.

01:33:57.924 --> 01:34:00.052
Welcome to the party.

01:34:01.094 --> 01:34:03.392
You said it best, didn't you?

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:06.058
What was it exactly?

01:34:06.224 --> 01:34:10.274
Oh, yeah. "We all
have our vices."

01:34:10.436 --> 01:34:13.030
Take a look at mine.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:21.407
Oh, fuck me!

01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:23.291
Oh!

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:46.181
- Now...
- Let me out!

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:48.065
Mother's calling.

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:51.151
Get me out!

01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:53.734
Oh, shut up, Ana.

01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:55.649
- Please!
- Ana, shut up.

01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:58.409
Now, Ivan, you shouldn't talk
to your mother that way.

01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:03.330
What's so funny?

01:35:03.489 --> 01:35:05.617
She's not my mother.

01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:10.331
Father didn't stop raping her
until after Nicky was born.

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:15.339
I told you she was a sick fuck.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.983
You're the sickest of them all.

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:39.659
How many others did you
sell to animals like Valko?

01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:43.705
How many more like me?

01:35:45.615 --> 01:35:49.165
How many?!

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:02.182
No. No.

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.388
No.

01:36:14.227 --> 01:36:17.151
No, please!

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:21.192
Baby!

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:23.453
Georgy!

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:26.364
No!

01:36:26.531 --> 01:36:28.750
Georgy!

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:52.557
Killing you would be too easy.

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:54.567
Georgy...

01:36:55.601 --> 01:36:59.572
I want you to have the
same experience as me!

01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:31.187
He's not a sick fuck anymore.

01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:35.442
You're fucking dead.
You're fucking dead.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.399
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:43.446
For the first few days,
I wished I was dead.

01:37:46.444 --> 01:37:51.291
Now... I don't know.

01:37:56.329 --> 01:37:58.002
No. No. No.

01:37:58.164 --> 01:38:00.963
No, no, no.

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:03.298
No!

01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:10.142
You think that hurts?!

01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:13.020
You just wait!

01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:20.861
Is that too tight?

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:22.317
Yes. Yes.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.982
Let me loosen it for you.

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:27.906
Whoops.

01:38:28.069 --> 01:38:29.616
Wrong way.

01:38:29.779 --> 01:38:31.656
Fucking whore.

01:38:31.823 --> 01:38:33.996
You fucking whore.

01:38:34.158 --> 01:38:35.705
Want some more?

01:38:38.704 --> 01:38:42.334
You let me know when
it's tight enough.

01:38:49.257 --> 01:38:52.352
Guys like it tight, right?

01:38:56.055 --> 01:38:58.023
Please!

01:39:07.316 --> 01:39:09.444
You should see yourself.

01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:13.490
Not so proud now, Ivan.

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.202
And to think...

01:39:17.368 --> 01:39:19.712
all of this could
have been avoided

01:39:19.871 --> 01:39:24.550
if you weren't such...
an asshole

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:27.713
piece of shit!

01:39:37.555 --> 01:39:39.023
Katie.

01:39:39.182 --> 01:39:41.150
Don't move.

01:39:41.309 --> 01:39:42.606
Please.

01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:51.319
Hey! Let her go!

01:39:54.113 --> 01:39:55.581
I said let her go!

01:39:56.699 --> 01:39:58.417
Let her go!

01:39:58.576 --> 01:40:00.499
Stop it, God damn it!

01:40:46.791 --> 01:40:48.793
I'm sorry.
