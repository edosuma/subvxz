02:49.628 --> 02:51.129
George, wake up.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.966
It's Saturday.

02:54.049 --> 02:57.886
I know, but it's the first day of soccer.
It's our first game.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.179
Soccer?

03:00.180 --> 03:03.517
I can't today. I caught a cold while sleeping.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.854
You'll be fine.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.356
Come on, come on, it'll be great.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.611
We're going to play like Brazilians.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.160
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Mom.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.454
Stuart, don't forget your water bottle.
George...

03:24.538 --> 03:26.248
Don't forget your cleats.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.667
You look especially beautiful today.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.461
Some people just know how to wear oatmeal.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.046
Okay, open up.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.467
Did you hear that? She said "blah-blah".

03:37.634 --> 03:39.344
I can't believe it.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.929
Her first word.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.683
Where's the baby book? I'm writing it down.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.144
I'm not sure that's technically a word.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.854
Of course it is.

03:49.438 --> 03:53.317
But your Uncle Crenshaw says
that every Little starts talking by nine months.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.527
In Uncle Crenshaw's case, never stops.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.571
Are you both coming to the game?

03:57.613 --> 03:58.989
Wouldn't miss it.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.908
Frederick...

04:01.575 --> 04:03.952
...this soccer game's making me very...

04:04.119 --> 04:07.289
- Proud?
- Anxious. Especially about--

04:11.126 --> 04:13.212
- I'm fine.
- He's fine.

04:13.378 --> 04:18.550
All those boys stomping around
with cleats. What if someone--

04:18.800 --> 04:22.763
Oh, honey. He's a Little.
All Littles are natural athletes.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.723
- Do you need--
- Could you?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.939
Okay, that's it for you.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.275
Snow, food.

04:35.567 --> 04:38.529
Food? Is it tuna? Or herring?

04:38.779 --> 04:41.281
Or, dare I say it, is it lox?

04:41.490 --> 04:44.326
Oh! Please be lox!

04:45.869 --> 04:47.162
That's for you.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.375
- Boys, are we ready to play some soccer?
- You bet, Dad.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.252
Oh, great. It's glop.

04:53.377 --> 04:58.298
Look what I'm reduced to.
I'm a Handi Wipe with hair.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.976
Wallace! Get up! There we go!

05:10.060 --> 05:13.605
That's right! Dig! Dig!
Go downfield! Downfield!

05:13.814 --> 05:15.941
You guys, spread out! Spread out!

05:28.829 --> 05:30.956
Well, George is getting a workout.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.294
What bothers me is that every kid
has had a chance to play except Stuart.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.837
There's plenty of time.

05:36.879 --> 05:39.214
Plenty of time? There's 40 seconds.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.342
He did an excellent job
of handing out the orange slices.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.428
That's not as easy as it looks.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.473
Okay, I'm glad he's not in the game.
I don't want him to get hurt.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.018
It's Pee-Wee soccer. Nobody gets hurt.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.692
Irwin, are you okay?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.485
Are you all right, Irwin?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.820
Do I look all right?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.614
Here. Come on.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.702
Better substitute.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.205
Tie game. We could play with just 10.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.540
But we have George, so it's like having nine.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.042
We'll have none of that.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.169
Come on, coach.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.380
Stuart! Go in for Irwin!

06:20.589 --> 06:23.592
Mom! Dad! I'm going in!

06:23.842 --> 06:24.968
Yeah, Stuart!

06:25.052 --> 06:26.094
Oh, dear.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.184
Watch your tail out there.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.561
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.021
Now, go get them.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.655
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

06:45.405 --> 06:47.699
Over here! I'm open!

06:49.910 --> 06:51.411
I got it! I got it!

06:51.578 --> 06:54.581
- I'm going to snatch him off the field.
- Honey, honey.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.793
Knowing boys as I do,
I think he might find that a little...

06:57.876 --> 06:59.211
Embarrassing.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.887
Get it, George!

07:09.930 --> 07:10.931
Go after it!

07:11.014 --> 07:13.851
Pass me the ball, lame-o. Come on.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.894
George, shoot!

07:16.895 --> 07:18.397
I got it! I got it!

07:18.605 --> 07:19.815
Shoot!

07:19.898 --> 07:21.567
I got it! I got it!

07:34.872 --> 07:36.748
Yeah, I did it!

07:47.259 --> 07:49.428
I have to start wearing a cup.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.017
He just looked so small out there.

07:55.142 --> 07:59.938
So lacking in bigness.
Does he really have to go back next week?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.357
We have to give him room to grow.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.110
I do. I let him slice his own banana.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.445
With a spoon.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.781
I let him drive his car to school.
No other mother does that.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.743
With George walking beside him
every step of the way.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.120
How much more room should I give him?

08:15.704 --> 08:18.081
A bit more than you're giving him now.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.597
Maybe Mom was right.
Maybe I shouldn't be playing soccer anymore.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.140
What does she want you to go out for?

08:36.225 --> 08:38.059
Painting or dancing.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.938
I guess it's my fault.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.690
I'm sorry I kicked you into the goal.

08:43.774 --> 08:47.319
That's okay. You won the game.
That's the main thing.

08:47.569 --> 08:51.615
No. The main thing is I hit Wallace in the face.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.072
Bogeys, 12:00! I got him, Brooklyn!

09:34.241 --> 09:36.410
Wouldn't it be cool if I actually flew this?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.912
Yeah. There's only one problem.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.623
Mom.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.209
- Hello, Mrs. Little.
- Hi, Will.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.378
- Is George home?
- He's with Stuart.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.673
We just need to tighten her up
and she's ready to fly.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.383
Hi, George. Hi, Stuart.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.718
Hi, Will.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.762
You want to take a break for a while?
I brought my PS2.

09:55.846 --> 09:56.972
Yeah, okay.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.891
But what about the plane?

09:58.974 --> 10:02.186
I want to play with Will for a while.
Play with Snowbell.

10:15.282 --> 10:19.453
Oh, well. Guess I'll have to finish it myself.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.339
If I can just--

10:34.927 --> 10:35.928
Oh, dear.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.061
Hey, what's that noise?

10:44.269 --> 10:45.938
Sounds like a lawnmower.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.940
Inside the house?

10:48.941 --> 10:50.317
Stuart!

11:00.327 --> 11:01.495
What are you doing?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.330
I'm not doing anything!

11:03.497 --> 11:05.123
Pull the brake!

11:11.672 --> 11:12.881
Get the book!

11:13.006 --> 11:16.760
This is cool. All my brother
does is jam crayons up his nose.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.264
It says, "On takeoff, pull back on the throttle".

11:20.472 --> 11:22.182
Takeoff? I'm in the air!

11:27.312 --> 11:29.815
Snowbell, get out of the way!

11:30.107 --> 11:31.775
Please, don't hurt me!

11:33.652 --> 11:34.778
What's going on?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.989
Stuart's just flying in the house.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.116
Flying in the house?

11:39.199 --> 11:41.785
At least he's indoors, nothing bad can happen.

11:41.869 --> 11:42.953
Watch out!

11:43.120 --> 11:44.329
Hit the dirt!

11:47.457 --> 11:48.667
Stuart!

11:55.924 --> 11:57.009
Duck!

12:10.772 --> 12:12.858
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

12:12.941 --> 12:14.818
I'm okay.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.361
Everything's fine.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.574
Fine? Stuart, you destroyed it.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.827
I'm sorry I wrecked it, George.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.163
I'm sure we can fix it with some glue.

12:26.246 --> 12:30.209
No, we can't. That's going in the trash.
It's much too dangerous.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.919
Thanks, Stuart.

12:38.091 --> 12:43.263
Why don't you take the boys home?
I think Stuart and I need to have a talk.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.848
Good idea.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.143
Come on, boys. Let's go home.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.646
She treats me like a baby.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.565
I'll fix you both some lunch.

12:53.857 --> 12:58.153
She just loves you so much.
It's hard for her to think of you in danger.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.322
Oh, this has been a bad day.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.325
Mom's mad, George won't play with me...

13:04.284 --> 13:08.121
I know. But every cloud has a silver lining.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.583
Doesn't that make them kind of heavy?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.544
No, it's an expression, Stuart.

13:13.627 --> 13:17.172
The thing about being a Little is
that you can look at any situation...

13:17.256 --> 13:19.299
...no matter how bleak, how hopeless...

13:19.383 --> 13:22.845
...and still see the bright side. The silver lining.

13:24.221 --> 13:29.309
Like in this situation,
the silver lining would be...

13:29.476 --> 13:32.271
Help me, Dad, because I'm struggling.

13:32.563 --> 13:36.984
George has found a newfriend.
So you could find a newfriend, too.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.236
You're a lot better at this than I am.

13:39.987 --> 13:44.116
I've been a Little a lot longer than you have.
You'll get the hang of it.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.827
Meantime, keep your chin up...

13:46.994 --> 13:50.164
...your back straight and your heart open.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.375
- Then what?
- One step at a time.

13:56.670 --> 14:01.300
And Canada is separate
from the United States because...

14:01.508 --> 14:04.469
...Canadians like to be alone.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.972
Review tomorrow, test on Friday.

14:07.139 --> 14:10.142
And please take your leftover lunches with you.

14:10.309 --> 14:13.770
My husband is tired of me coming home
smelling like salami.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.232
Tony, would you like to come over
to my house this afternoon?

14:17.316 --> 14:19.651
Sorry, pal. I've got karate.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.069
Hey, Mark.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.988
Guitar lessons.

14:46.720 --> 14:50.349
Some of the guys are going over to
Will's house to play basketball.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.517
Can I come?

14:51.558 --> 14:54.061
They didn't exactly mention
that you were invited.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.773
Oh, that's okay. I'm busy anyway.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.108
Just tell Mom I walked you home.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.944
I owe you one.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.696
Sure.

15:26.552 --> 15:27.636
Whoa!

15:35.310 --> 15:36.520
Miss?

15:37.020 --> 15:38.188
Miss?

15:38.814 --> 15:40.399
Are you alive?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.278
She's alive.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.363
Out of the way, please.
Injured bird coming through!

15:53.453 --> 15:54.955
What's going on?

15:55.289 --> 15:57.082
My wing.

15:57.291 --> 16:00.252
Where am I? Hey! Where's the falcon?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.587
What falcon?

16:03.422 --> 16:06.133
That falcon! Drive! Get out of here!

16:06.300 --> 16:07.926
Oh, my!

16:08.010 --> 16:10.262
Get lost, you disgusting vulture!

16:13.223 --> 16:15.642
Eat my feathers, you vile buzzard!

16:15.726 --> 16:18.061
Do we really want to antagonize him?

16:21.773 --> 16:23.942
Oh, boy, we've got a problem.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.361
No, you can make it. Don't slow down.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.417
You did it.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.420
Yeah. I did.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.131
So, who do I have to thank?

16:46.507 --> 16:50.177
Forgive me. My name is Stuart. Stuart Little.

16:50.344 --> 16:53.972
I'm Margalo. Just Margalo.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.391
Margalo.

17:00.354 --> 17:03.190
You're so strong. Are you an athlete?

17:03.357 --> 17:05.150
Well, yeah.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.319
I play a little soccer...

17:07.694 --> 17:09.112
...fly airplanes...

17:09.195 --> 17:10.446
...race boats.

17:10.531 --> 17:14.992
You can put me down now.
My legs are fine. It's my wing that's hurt.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.997
Oh. Yeah. Of course.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.546
There used to be bandages in here.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.884
- Hey, why don't we try your scarf?
- Good idea.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.848
My pin, it's....

17:37.266 --> 17:40.519
Must have happened
when that falcon smashed into me.

17:40.769 --> 17:44.773
It was part of our nest when I was a baby.
I've had it my whole life.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.818
It's the only thing I have left of my mother's.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.195
Gee, that's too bad.

17:50.404 --> 17:51.905
Yeah.

17:57.369 --> 17:58.954
There. How's that?

17:59.121 --> 18:02.332
That's much better, thank you.

18:02.541 --> 18:05.544
So tell me, Stuart Little,
do you actually live here?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.714
Oh, yeah. I'm a real Little. I'm the middle child.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.382
The middle Little.

18:10.591 --> 18:11.550
Cute.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.719
So, where do you live?

18:13.886 --> 18:18.807
- You know, here and there.
- You mean you don't have a home?

18:18.932 --> 18:21.935
Once, we lived in a box.
Well, not really a box.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.522
It was one of those things
where people keep their jewelry.

18:25.689 --> 18:26.773
A jewelry box?

18:26.857 --> 18:29.902
Yes! That's what it must have been.
A jewelry box.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.404
It was wonderful.

18:33.113 --> 18:37.659
Well, I've taken too much of your time.
I'd better go before it gets dark.

18:37.868 --> 18:42.539
No, wait. You can't go out there.
Not while you're hurt. You should stay here.

18:42.748 --> 18:46.752
I couldn't impose.
I mean, you'd really do that for me?

18:47.044 --> 18:49.755
Sure, I have just the thing. I'll be right back.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.841
- Meanwhile, you can use my cat's bed.
- You have a cat?

18:52.925 --> 18:56.512
Don't worry about Snowbell.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.729
Those flies really come back on you.

19:12.486 --> 19:15.656
I try to eat right and yet I still feel bloated.

19:16.031 --> 19:17.908
Maybe more food will help.

19:20.744 --> 19:21.745
Hi there.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.457
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you!

19:25.624 --> 19:28.293
Scare me? That's a laugh.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.712
Hear that? That was a laugh.

19:37.135 --> 19:40.305
Hairball. Major hairball.

19:40.973 --> 19:44.685
And yet we continue to lick ourselves.
Unbelievable.

19:44.935 --> 19:48.438
Hey, Snowbell. Meet Margalo.
She'll be staying with us for a while.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.649
Staying? Are you out of your mind?

19:50.774 --> 19:55.654
You can't just drag stray birds in here.
Do you think this is a halfway house?

19:55.863 --> 19:57.364
Look, she's filthy.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.950
No offense. She could have germs.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.454
And how do you know she's not a vagrant
or a thief? Get rid of her.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.373
We're home. Sorry we're late.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.293
- Little hi, Little low.
- Little hey, Little ho.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.170
What the heck was that?

20:11.461 --> 20:14.131
That's just how we greet each other.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.465
Interesting.

20:15.674 --> 20:18.886
Nauseating is more like it.
You're in for it now, missy.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.431
Mother Little hates when animals
walk in here off the street.

20:22.556 --> 20:26.101
When she sees this, she's going to throw a fit.

20:30.939 --> 20:34.568
Such a pretty little birdie.

20:35.319 --> 20:38.322
Maybe it's just my friends she hates.

20:38.572 --> 20:42.451
- I found her.
- Found me? He saved my life.

20:43.577 --> 20:44.870
He did?

20:45.078 --> 20:46.997
- From a falcon.
- What's that?

20:47.080 --> 20:49.291
Stuart saved this little bird from a falcon.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.044
A falcon? They are fierce creatures.

20:52.127 --> 20:55.756
Why does the city have falcons?
That shouldn't be allowed. Write a letter.

20:55.839 --> 20:59.718
On the other hand, we have a hero here.
Way to go, Stuart.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.929
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.764
Silver lining.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.768
It's a guy thing.

21:07.935 --> 21:09.061
Is it?

21:10.604 --> 21:12.940
Isn't it nice that Stuart has a friend?

21:13.106 --> 21:15.901
I don't think Stuart thinks of her as a friend.

21:16.109 --> 21:19.571
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's smitten.

21:19.738 --> 21:22.282
He's infatuated. He's bedazzled.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.077
But he's a baby.

21:25.244 --> 21:28.121
Boys start having crushes really young.

21:29.957 --> 21:33.627
Frederick, did you have many crushes?

21:34.920 --> 21:36.630
I'm still having one.

21:42.678 --> 21:45.347
So, Margalo, can I get you anything else?

21:45.556 --> 21:48.392
Whip you up an omelet? Pop you a tart?

21:48.559 --> 21:50.227
Stuart, I'm full.

21:50.352 --> 21:54.439
Full? You eat like a bird.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.859
Come on, Stuart, time for school.

21:56.942 --> 22:00.654
I'm not going to school.
I'm staying home to take care of Margalo.

22:01.029 --> 22:04.950
Guess again. You are going to school,
and I'll take care of Margalo.

22:04.992 --> 22:06.660
Look both ways crossing the street...

22:06.743 --> 22:09.454
...wear galoshes and, in art class,
don't run with scissors.

22:09.538 --> 22:11.165
I'll get your backpack.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.210
Mothers... You know.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.547
- Well, I don't really know.
- No?

22:19.006 --> 22:22.217
See, my mom just kind of one day...

22:22.426 --> 22:24.428
...wasn't there anymore.

22:25.679 --> 22:28.557
So you've been completely
on your own all your life?

22:28.724 --> 22:31.768
- You bet.
- I'll bet it's been scary.

22:32.186 --> 22:33.979
No, it's been an adventure.

22:34.021 --> 22:36.315
I wish I had some adventures.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.525
I'm only allowed to paint.

22:38.775 --> 22:43.530
Hey, life is an adventure.
Just walking out that door is an adventure.

22:43.697 --> 22:45.699
Come on, Stu. We're late.

22:50.746 --> 22:52.498
Go for it, kid.

22:52.748 --> 22:54.291
The adventure begins.

22:59.379 --> 23:02.090
That feels like enough adventure for one day.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.885
Hey, look! The Yankees won.

23:07.679 --> 23:09.848
There we go.

23:10.182 --> 23:12.684
Can you say, "Walk with Mommy"?

23:12.893 --> 23:14.186
"Mommy"?

23:14.478 --> 23:15.979
"Walk"?

23:18.065 --> 23:19.024
Nothing.

23:30.911 --> 23:33.956
Martha and I are going out for a bit.
Can I bring you anything?

23:34.122 --> 23:35.290
No, thanks.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.751
Say, "Bye-bye, birdie".

23:37.793 --> 23:40.963
Say, "Bye-bye". Martha. Say, "Bye-bye, birdie".

23:54.726 --> 23:56.228
Fresh air.

24:07.281 --> 24:08.574
Remember me?

24:08.615 --> 24:10.117
You scared me.

24:10.159 --> 24:12.870
What can I say? I'm a scary guy.

24:13.120 --> 24:18.125
So, Margalo, you case the joint?
Any valuables? Come on, thrill me. Chill me.

24:18.208 --> 24:21.920
They ain't got much.
The mom's got a ring, but it's only two carats.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.255
All right, fine.

24:23.422 --> 24:28.343
What else have they got?

24:28.468 --> 24:30.220
Well, you know, not that much.
I mean, they mostly just have each other.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.639
A moment while I vomit.

24:32.723 --> 24:34.683
Why don't we just try somewhere else?

24:34.766 --> 24:36.059
Because you're set up here.

24:36.143 --> 24:38.395
They trust you. They like you.

24:40.314 --> 24:42.107
And maybe...

24:42.316 --> 24:44.401
...you like them.

24:46.153 --> 24:47.696
Hey, Margalo, come on.

24:48.197 --> 24:49.656
Don't con a conman.

24:49.865 --> 24:52.576
Nobody else ever invited me to live with them.

24:52.701 --> 24:55.871
Oh, really? Who found a pitiful orphan bird...

24:56.079 --> 24:58.332
...and plucked her out of the gutter?

24:58.415 --> 25:00.125
Who shared his food with her...

25:00.209 --> 25:03.587
...and, I hasten to add,
taught her a trade? Who?

25:03.879 --> 25:06.548
- You did.
- I did. Right.

25:06.757 --> 25:11.720
Well, then, straighten up and fly right.
And remember, you are here on business.

25:11.929 --> 25:13.931
You're not here to play around.

25:15.557 --> 25:19.686
Come on, Falcon!
When I'm on a job, I never play around!

26:56.283 --> 26:57.784
Are you cold?

26:58.452 --> 27:03.081
I guess when the weather gets too cold,
you'll just fly south for the winter?

27:03.248 --> 27:06.919
Well, to tell you the truth, I've never flown south.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.588
It's kind of a dream of mine.

27:09.922 --> 27:13.091
Get out of this cold, windy city,
catch that jet stream...

27:13.217 --> 27:18.138
Fruit trees, millions of new birds to meet.

27:18.263 --> 27:20.974
- I hear it's paradise.
- Then how come you haven't gone?

27:22.267 --> 27:25.103
Something's always stopping me.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.856
Something's always stopping me, too.

27:27.940 --> 27:31.193
Everybody around here thinks
I'm too small to accomplish anything.

27:31.276 --> 27:35.113
Hey, the way I see it, you're as big as you feel.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.075
Yeah. Boy, I'm really glad you fell into my car.

27:38.158 --> 27:43.080
I mean, you know...
I mean I'm not glad you fell. I just--

27:43.288 --> 27:45.123
Want some more popcorn?

27:45.624 --> 27:46.917
Okay.

27:48.961 --> 27:51.129
What?

27:51.797 --> 27:53.257
My pin.

27:54.091 --> 27:55.801
It's fixed. How--

27:56.009 --> 27:59.346
On my way home from school,
I drive right past where you crashed.

27:59.429 --> 28:00.973
It was no big deal.

28:01.223 --> 28:02.933
I mean, there was finding it...

28:03.016 --> 28:06.270
...figuring out how the pieces fit together...

28:06.520 --> 28:08.522
...and you know, fixing it.

28:09.565 --> 28:11.149
And no big deal. Just...

28:11.191 --> 28:12.359
Oh, Scottie.

28:12.901 --> 28:15.153
...one, two, three.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.201
Good as new.

28:23.704 --> 28:26.582
No, Stuart, it's not.

28:27.541 --> 28:30.586
It's much, much better.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.839
- Stay with me.
- All the time.

29:02.701 --> 29:05.120
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

29:05.329 --> 29:07.080
What are you talking about?

29:07.164 --> 29:11.919
I'm talking about you
and your little mouse friend.

29:12.461 --> 29:17.174
Big mistake! Never make a friend I can eat.

29:17.841 --> 29:19.676
Now, get me that ring!

29:19.927 --> 29:23.472
Or the mouse is lunch.

29:38.028 --> 29:40.656
- I'll do the dishes.
- You did them last night.

29:40.823 --> 29:42.991
For you, I'd do dishes every night.

29:48.455 --> 29:50.958
That way, I don't have to change the baby.

29:57.631 --> 29:59.842
She just dropped her dolly.

30:00.467 --> 30:01.635
I'll just--

30:04.513 --> 30:05.889
- Frederick!
- What?

30:05.973 --> 30:08.100
- My ring. It's gone.
- What do you mean?

30:08.141 --> 30:09.643
It's gone!

30:09.852 --> 30:11.603
- Are you absolutely--
- Positive.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.188
Unless--

30:14.731 --> 30:16.316
I'll call the plumber!

30:18.235 --> 30:19.361
What's going on?

30:19.444 --> 30:22.906
Mom's ring went down the drain. I can't reach it.

30:23.157 --> 30:24.950
Hey! What about me?

30:25.117 --> 30:27.578
I can do it. Let me go, Dad.

30:27.870 --> 30:29.955
- Go where?
- Down the drain.

30:30.164 --> 30:33.167
I can bring it back up. It's an adventure.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.836
I don't know. It's awfully dark down there.

30:36.044 --> 30:37.880
And smelly. And cold.

30:38.088 --> 30:42.050
But it's Mom's ring. She loves that ring.

30:42.342 --> 30:45.345
Come on, Dad. Let me try.

31:05.199 --> 31:09.620
Now, if it gets too cold, or too scary...

31:09.828 --> 31:11.121
...you just tell us.

31:11.205 --> 31:13.874
Don't worry, Dad. I can handle it.

31:15.876 --> 31:19.463
- Or yank on the string, we'll pull you up.
- Will do.

31:25.719 --> 31:27.054
How's it so far?

31:27.221 --> 31:30.557
Wet. There's a lot of slimy stuff
all over the walls.

31:30.891 --> 31:34.186
- What does it look like?
- Like the inside of your nose.

31:36.563 --> 31:39.566
- Can you see the bottom yet?
- No, just more pipe.

31:39.733 --> 31:42.236
And everything we ate for dinner last week.

31:42.402 --> 31:44.738
And the pipe seems to go on and on.

31:45.072 --> 31:46.865
Well, the plumber said--

31:47.533 --> 31:48.826
What's going on?

31:48.909 --> 31:50.285
Is that a new top?

31:51.078 --> 31:55.916
You know, you have such taste.
Simple elegance is what I call it.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.876
What's on the other end of that string?

31:57.918 --> 31:59.336
- This string?
- Yes.

32:00.087 --> 32:04.049
Well, now, don't get excited,
but someone that you and I love...

32:04.550 --> 32:07.719
...has volunteered to go down the drain
to get your ring.

32:08.011 --> 32:09.888
- Stuart?
- Good guess, Mom.

32:10.138 --> 32:12.850
You let our son go down the kitchen drain?

32:13.016 --> 32:14.893
Now, Eleanor, don't be upset.

32:15.060 --> 32:19.273
It's been well thought out.
If there's a problem, I pull on the string and--

32:21.024 --> 32:22.526
Now you can be upset.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.736
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

32:24.820 --> 32:27.406
Hurry! I'm slipping.

32:27.990 --> 32:29.700
- Get more string.
- Great.

32:30.534 --> 32:32.035
There must be string here.

32:32.119 --> 32:35.080
- There is no more.
- What else can we use?

32:35.205 --> 32:36.790
- Spaghetti?
- We're out of spaghetti.

32:36.874 --> 32:39.585
- Well, do we have macaroni?
- That's too short.

32:39.793 --> 32:42.004
- We can tie it together with--
- No.

32:42.212 --> 32:43.589
Hurry!

32:43.881 --> 32:45.257
Hang on, Stuart!

32:45.757 --> 32:49.386
- Margalo, what are you doing?
- Stuart, I'm coming! Grab on!

32:50.012 --> 32:51.221
Lower! Lower!

32:51.305 --> 32:53.056
I got it!

32:55.475 --> 32:57.728
- Are you all right?
- Are you hurt?

32:59.980 --> 33:02.232
Don't scare me like that.

33:02.441 --> 33:06.028
Margalo, you're the best friend I ever had.

33:14.161 --> 33:17.831
What if someone had accidentally
turned on the garbage disposal?

33:18.081 --> 33:19.666
I would not have let that happen.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.336
- You let him go down the drain.
- He wanted to go.

33:22.419 --> 33:24.171
If Martha wanted to go up the chimney...

33:24.254 --> 33:27.341
...or George wanted to go into the toilet,
would you let them?

33:27.424 --> 33:30.093
I love Stuart as much as you do.

33:30.427 --> 33:32.721
I just don't happen to be quite as--

33:32.846 --> 33:36.683
Emotional? Irrational?
What were you going to say?

33:37.684 --> 33:38.894
I forget.

33:39.102 --> 33:41.605
I know I'm overprotective, it's just...

33:41.855 --> 33:44.733
...I can't stand the idea of Stuart getting hurt.

34:28.235 --> 34:30.529
I'm sorry, Stuart.

35:14.239 --> 35:15.324
What?

35:24.041 --> 35:26.210
You people sure like your meat loaf.

35:26.877 --> 35:28.295
You find the ring?

35:29.796 --> 35:31.089
Everything but.

35:34.259 --> 35:37.596
Has anyone seen Margalo?
I can't find her anywhere.

35:38.222 --> 35:42.142
Maybe she just went for a walk
or a little flight around the neighborhood.

35:42.226 --> 35:43.977
Sure, to strengthen her wing.

35:44.061 --> 35:48.106
Yeah, maybe. But why'd she leave me her pin?

35:49.399 --> 35:52.402
Oh, you know, Stuart...

35:52.569 --> 35:55.489
...Margalo is kind of a free spirit.

35:55.739 --> 35:58.075
Maybe she just felt it was time to go.

35:58.325 --> 36:00.452
Without even saying goodbye?

36:24.434 --> 36:25.727
What are you doing?

36:25.811 --> 36:29.022
I think I know what happened.
I think that falcon got her.

36:29.690 --> 36:32.109
- Yeah?
- I'm going to find her.

36:33.110 --> 36:35.696
And don't try to talk me out of it.
I've made up my mind.

36:35.779 --> 36:38.615
Are you crazy? You can't go out there.

36:38.782 --> 36:42.953
Because I'm too small? Let me tell you
something, you're as big as you feel.

36:43.453 --> 36:45.622
Then let me come with you.

36:45.789 --> 36:48.375
No, I need you to stay and cover for me.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.460
Cover for you? How?

36:50.627 --> 36:52.713
Make something up. You're smart.

36:52.796 --> 36:54.423
Stuart, she's just a bird.

36:54.506 --> 36:57.342
No, George, she's my friend.

36:57.634 --> 37:01.346
And when you're friends with Stuart Little,
you're friends for life.

37:01.805 --> 37:06.393
Well, if you won't let me come,
at least get somebody to go with you.

37:07.227 --> 37:11.315
Snow!

37:11.398 --> 37:15.360
The good silverware's in the dining room.
Take anything, but don't hurt me.

37:15.402 --> 37:17.070
It's me. Stuart.

37:18.238 --> 37:20.574
You. This better be important.

37:20.782 --> 37:22.326
Margalo's still missing.

37:22.409 --> 37:25.913
I should've been more specific.
I meant important to me.

37:26.079 --> 37:28.749
I'm going to look for her. I hoped you'd come.

37:28.916 --> 37:33.128
Look, Stuart, do yourself a favor.
Buy a parakeet and forget her.

37:33.337 --> 37:37.132
I can't forget her. She's in
terrible trouble and I have to help her.

37:37.341 --> 37:39.760
I mean what am I, a man or a...

37:39.968 --> 37:40.969
...mouse?

37:42.930 --> 37:44.681
Is that a trick question?

37:45.766 --> 37:48.268
It's important. You got to help me.

37:48.435 --> 37:50.103
And why would I do that?

37:50.270 --> 37:51.897
Well, because we're family...

37:51.939 --> 37:54.942
...and because I'd do the same for you.

37:55.108 --> 38:00.113
And if you don't, and the Littles ask
where I am, George'll say you ate me.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.657
What?

38:01.949 --> 38:04.743
Why you little rat!

38:05.244 --> 38:07.079
You know something?

38:07.287 --> 38:11.917
Everybody thinks you're so nice.
You're not so nice.

38:12.084 --> 38:16.129
Come on! It'll be fun. It's an adventure.

38:19.591 --> 38:23.929
Hey! Mario Andretti, slow down.
Let's pace ourselves.

38:24.096 --> 38:25.722
I'll have a heart attack.

38:25.806 --> 38:30.435
I think I'm having a thrombosis
and I don't even know what it means.

38:34.314 --> 38:37.693
George! Stuart! Breakfast!

38:38.569 --> 38:40.154
Get it while it's hot.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.114
Say, "mama".

38:43.157 --> 38:45.409
Say, "dada".

38:45.576 --> 38:47.786
Say anything?

38:49.246 --> 38:50.747
'Morning, George.

38:50.956 --> 38:52.166
Where's Stuart?

38:52.249 --> 38:53.625
He already left.

38:54.334 --> 38:56.420
He did? Without eating breakfast?

38:57.671 --> 38:59.965
He had to get to school early...

39:00.174 --> 39:02.301
...because he's in a school play.

39:02.759 --> 39:04.011
Really?

39:04.094 --> 39:08.182
Yes. He plays a mouse. And they
rehearse every morning before school.

39:10.350 --> 39:11.977
Why didn't he tell us?

39:12.060 --> 39:15.397
He forgot.
You know, being worried about Margalo.

39:16.982 --> 39:18.275
Right.

39:18.942 --> 39:21.111
Good. This'll keep his mind off it.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.614
Got to go.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.290
Say, "oatmeal".

39:38.420 --> 39:41.089
Oh, boy. This is a sign, Stuart.
Like the burning bush.

39:41.298 --> 39:44.051
Except it's a carburetor and I'm not Moses.

39:44.301 --> 39:46.178
But it's telling us something.

39:46.220 --> 39:48.180
Let your people go!

39:48.388 --> 39:50.724
- We're not giving up.
- Oh, why not?

39:50.933 --> 39:53.977
Giving up is fun.
And look at all the time you save.

39:54.144 --> 39:58.649
I'm telling you, if more people gave up,
there'd be fewer wars.

40:24.716 --> 40:26.051
Bill.

40:31.431 --> 40:32.808
George.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.226
Hi, Mom.

40:35.978 --> 40:37.104
Where's Stuart?

40:37.187 --> 40:38.438
He's not home?

40:39.356 --> 40:43.235
Oh, I just remembered. He told me
to tell you that he's rehearsing again.

40:43.277 --> 40:46.321
At Will's house.
And he's sleeping over there tonight.

40:46.488 --> 40:48.448
Sleepover? On a school night?

40:48.532 --> 40:51.201
Hey, that's what he said. Got to go.

41:02.462 --> 41:03.547
Hello?

41:03.630 --> 41:08.302
Hey, Will. It's me, George.
If my mom calls, Stuart's at your house, okay?

41:08.594 --> 41:10.137
Hold on a second.

41:11.430 --> 41:12.389
Hello?

41:12.639 --> 41:15.976
Will, hi. It's Mrs. Little.
May I speak with Stuart, please?

41:16.101 --> 41:18.312
- Stuart?
- You know, my son.

41:18.604 --> 41:21.273
Oh, Stuart. You mean now?

41:21.481 --> 41:23.400
Well, now is when I'm calling.

41:23.484 --> 41:25.819
Oh, he just went in the bathroom.

41:26.111 --> 41:29.781
I think he'll be a while. He brought a magazine.

41:29.948 --> 41:32.910
- Well, then, is your mother there?
- Hold on a second.

41:33.994 --> 41:35.829
- I told her.
- Did she buy it?

41:35.954 --> 41:39.208
Yeah, but now she wants to speak to my mom.
What will I tell her?

41:39.291 --> 41:40.876
Make something up. You're smart.

41:40.959 --> 41:43.754
If I was smart, I wouldn't be in this situation.

41:45.631 --> 41:49.092
She can't come to the phone right now.
She's in the bathroom, too.

41:49.176 --> 41:51.512
But not the same bathroom!

41:51.803 --> 41:55.682
- Just let her know I called. Thanks.
- Okay, Mrs. Little.

41:56.808 --> 41:59.144
- It's all clear.
- I owe you one.

41:59.311 --> 42:03.524
- Now will you tell me what's going on?
- It's too complicated. Later.

42:05.442 --> 42:07.402
Little hi, Little low.

42:07.611 --> 42:09.238
Little hey, Little ho.

42:11.156 --> 42:13.408
- Boys home?
- Well, George is.

42:13.617 --> 42:18.121
But Stuart is rehearsing his play.
Then he's sleeping over at Will's house.

42:18.330 --> 42:23.001
- He's going without George?
- I think it'll give him room to grow.

42:28.006 --> 42:33.262
Oh, Stuart, we've been walking for hours.
I can't take another step.

42:34.429 --> 42:38.642
You know me, I hate to be negative.
But when I walk this much, I chafe.

42:38.892 --> 42:42.479
Also, I hate to bring this up...

42:43.188 --> 42:44.898
...but I need to go tinky.

42:45.357 --> 42:46.733
How about the alley?

42:46.817 --> 42:49.695
I'm a house cat.
We're fastidious creatures.

42:49.862 --> 42:54.533
We don't just yell, "Bomb's away!"
and go wherever we are!

42:54.741 --> 42:57.619
Oh, look, let's face it.
We'll never find her.

42:57.870 --> 43:00.497
If only we knew someone
who really knew the city.

43:00.581 --> 43:03.792
Yeah, someone who knows
the city's disgusting underbelly.

43:04.251 --> 43:06.295
Who do I know that's disgusting?

43:17.181 --> 43:20.017
Don't threaten me!
What I could tell the health inspector...

43:20.100 --> 43:22.561
...would close you down in a New York minute!

43:22.644 --> 43:24.021
Monty!

43:24.938 --> 43:29.735
Snowbell! What are you doing here?

43:29.818 --> 43:32.946
- We've been looking all over for you.
- We need your help.

43:33.030 --> 43:36.325
Hey, Snow, are you two still friends
or can I eat him?

43:36.533 --> 43:39.620
- No, Monty, you can't eat him.
- Please.

43:39.703 --> 43:41.413
No! Now, pay attention.

43:41.497 --> 43:44.124
What do you know about a bird called Falcon?

43:44.333 --> 43:48.921
Falcon? Oh, that's a bad guy.
You don't want to fool with him.

43:49.087 --> 43:50.631
Where would we find him?

43:50.714 --> 43:52.925
You don't want to find him.

43:53.091 --> 43:56.386
You don't want anything to do with him.
Trust me.

43:56.470 --> 44:00.390
He'd eat you so fast you'd be falcon poop
before you could yell for help.

44:01.183 --> 44:02.434
Falcons are vicious.

44:02.476 --> 44:06.438
They grab you by your neck and carry you
so high, you can't even see the ground.

44:06.480 --> 44:11.819
Then they drop you. And when you land,
they drink what's left through a straw.

44:13.153 --> 44:14.613
Snowbell, are you all right?

44:14.696 --> 44:17.908
Oh, yeah. In fact, good news.

44:18.075 --> 44:20.577
I no longer need a litter box.

44:22.704 --> 44:25.249
Mop up on aisle three.

44:27.334 --> 44:30.462
Stu, listen. This whole thing
has been a groove and a gas...

44:30.504 --> 44:33.173
...but it's important to know
when the fun's over.

44:33.257 --> 44:36.426
You don't want to be that last
pathetic person who leaves a party.

44:36.510 --> 44:40.430
I told you. I'm not giving up.
We're going to find the falcon.

44:40.764 --> 44:43.308
All right, then. It's your funeral.

44:43.517 --> 44:46.019
Okay, listen. Listen carefully.

44:46.186 --> 44:48.939
The falcon lives across the park...

44:49.231 --> 44:52.442
...at the very tiptop of the Pishkin Building.

44:52.609 --> 44:56.363
Not many people go up there.
And even fewer return.

45:19.553 --> 45:22.347
Well, here we are, Snowbell. This is it.

45:28.896 --> 45:31.523
"Salmon, catfish, tuna."

45:31.732 --> 45:33.275
Why do they taunt me?

45:33.400 --> 45:37.696
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Stay on track, will you?

45:37.905 --> 45:40.199
I'm nervous. When I'm nervous, I eat.

45:40.365 --> 45:45.329
Because I know in my growling gut
if anything happens to you, I'll be blamed.

45:45.537 --> 45:49.666
I'm sure they already know we're gone
and plan to replace me with a hamster.

45:49.917 --> 45:51.877
Don't worry. George has us covered.

45:51.919 --> 45:55.839
George?
George doesn't know poop from applesauce.

45:56.048 --> 45:58.217
And I say that with a great deal of affection.

46:04.640 --> 46:08.185
- Hello, Little residence.
- Oh, George. I'm glad you answered.

46:08.393 --> 46:10.145
Who is it? Can you speak louder?

46:10.229 --> 46:12.606
George, it's me, Stuart.

46:15.734 --> 46:19.738
Where are you? How are you? Did you
find her? Are you all right? How's Snowbell?

46:19.822 --> 46:22.699
When'll you be home?
Mom and Dad are asking lots of questions.

46:22.783 --> 46:23.659
So are you.

46:23.742 --> 46:27.412
I only have a second.
I just want you to know that we're on the trail...

46:27.454 --> 46:30.874
...and with any luck, we'll be home by dinner.
And, George...

46:31.124 --> 46:33.544
- ...thanks for covering for me.
- Sure.

46:33.710 --> 46:35.087
But where are you?

46:35.212 --> 46:38.423
Now, listen closely.
We're at the Pishkin Building.

46:38.507 --> 46:41.468
Please deposit $0.35 for the next five minutes.

46:41.552 --> 46:45.764
- Snowbell, I need more change.
- What do I look like, a fanny pack?

46:45.973 --> 46:47.558
Are you still there?

46:47.724 --> 46:49.935
Is that Stuart?

46:50.227 --> 46:52.104
Let me think. Yeah.

46:53.063 --> 46:55.065
I thought he was coming home.

46:55.274 --> 46:58.318
He is. Later.
He and Will just need to rehearse some more.

46:58.402 --> 47:01.405
In fact, I just left him at Will's.

47:06.827 --> 47:08.996
Hello, Mrs. Little. Is George home?

47:11.498 --> 47:13.792
- Will, I found it!
- Found what?

47:13.834 --> 47:16.378
- The calculator.
- The calculator?

47:16.628 --> 47:18.714
Will, where's Stuart?

47:19.673 --> 47:21.967
It's okay. She knows about the play.

47:22.217 --> 47:24.344
It's supposed to be a surprise.

47:24.720 --> 47:28.974
I had to tell her so she'd know
Stuart's at your house. We're going back there.

47:29.016 --> 47:31.810
Oh, yeah. Right. It's going to be great.

47:31.852 --> 47:33.979
I just need to get the calculator?

47:34.062 --> 47:37.649
- To figure out how long to rehearse.
- It's a very complicated play.

47:37.691 --> 47:40.986
- Come on. Let's go.
- See you later, Mrs. Little.

47:41.653 --> 47:44.323
George, don't forget
you two have a soccer game later.

47:44.364 --> 47:45.866
We'll meet you there!

47:50.204 --> 47:54.583
I can't handle this. I'm too stressed.
All this lying. I've never lied before.

47:54.875 --> 47:56.710
That's why she believes you.

47:56.877 --> 47:58.837
- Boy, are we in trouble.
- "We"?

47:58.879 --> 48:02.591
Yeah, "we". He didn't spend the night
rehearsing at my house.

48:12.684 --> 48:16.438
What are you planning to do,
Mighty Mouse, scale the wall?

48:16.688 --> 48:18.524
I'll think of something.

48:32.579 --> 48:33.956
So long, Snowbell!

48:34.122 --> 48:35.666
You've got guts, kid.

48:36.124 --> 48:38.710
Guts and spunk.

48:38.961 --> 48:41.129
Not to mention moxie.

48:41.588 --> 48:43.674
You've got guts, spunk and moxie.

49:02.442 --> 49:04.736
Okay. Here we go.

49:05.279 --> 49:09.408
All right, Falcon.
Hand her over and nobody gets hurt.

49:31.180 --> 49:32.514
You up here?

49:38.312 --> 49:39.730
Is anybody here?

49:39.938 --> 49:41.899
I'm here.

49:45.152 --> 49:49.114
I came for my friend Margalo.
If you've hurt her, I'll--

49:49.323 --> 49:52.451
- You'll what?
- Tell me right now. Is she all right?

49:52.659 --> 49:55.496
Why not ask her yourself, Whiskers?

49:58.499 --> 50:00.501
Margalo, run!

50:01.043 --> 50:04.588
Fly away while I've got him covered.
What are you waiting for?

50:07.341 --> 50:11.303
This kid's priceless.
Tell me, Cheese-face, does this sound familiar?

50:11.553 --> 50:14.515
"Oh, my wing. I don't think I can fly."

50:15.098 --> 50:16.850
What are you talking about?

50:16.934 --> 50:21.438
I can't drill through the wood.
She scammed you. She played you like a harp.

50:21.730 --> 50:24.441
Margalo, what does he mean?

50:24.691 --> 50:29.321
Okay, now it's getting sad.
Maybe this will clear things up.

50:30.197 --> 50:32.157
My mom's ring.

50:34.993 --> 50:39.122
I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.

50:39.832 --> 50:42.668
But, Margalo, why?

50:43.293 --> 50:45.003
Don't be upset, Mouse-boy.

50:45.254 --> 50:49.508
She has conned smarter than you.
Or did you think you were special?

50:49.633 --> 50:51.343
A real friend?

50:51.552 --> 50:54.012
I didn't lie about that, Stuart.

50:54.555 --> 50:56.348
You are my friend.

50:57.224 --> 50:58.934
Then come with me.

50:59.726 --> 51:01.478
She's not going anywhere.

51:01.979 --> 51:03.355
Oh, yes, she is.

51:06.400 --> 51:10.195
Was that your best shot?
Now, let me show you mine.

51:11.196 --> 51:13.365
Don't hurt him, Falcon!

51:14.032 --> 51:16.785
I won't hurt him. The sidewalk will!

51:16.994 --> 51:19.371
Can't we talk this over?

51:21.248 --> 51:23.083
No! Stuart!

51:25.002 --> 51:27.880
Let me go! No, Falcon!

51:41.518 --> 51:45.272
A few days in here should provide you
with an attitude adjustment.

51:50.944 --> 51:52.905
What have I done?

51:54.781 --> 51:59.453
I'll bet something terrible has happened.
The Littles will kill me.

51:59.536 --> 52:03.540
I know, I'll bring home another mouse
in a snazzy outfit...

52:03.624 --> 52:07.461
...teach him to drive a sports car
and pass him off as Stuart.

52:07.628 --> 52:11.548
Who am I kidding?
I have to get up there. But how?

52:19.765 --> 52:21.725
I hope I live to regret this.

52:27.606 --> 52:29.316
Stuart? Yoo-hoo?

52:35.322 --> 52:37.658
Come out, come out wherever you are.

52:38.951 --> 52:41.703
Please don't jump out from behind anything.

52:42.079 --> 52:46.083
Remember, I have a strong stomach
but a very weak heart.

52:48.293 --> 52:49.753
Here, Mousie-Mousie.

52:50.087 --> 52:53.173
Snowbell? Is that you? Is that really you?

52:53.423 --> 52:56.593
- Margalo? Where are you?
- In the can.

52:56.802 --> 52:58.262
Oh, okay. I'll wait.

52:58.345 --> 53:00.764
No, in the paint can.

53:03.684 --> 53:06.687
Why are you in there?
Is this some kind of trick?

53:06.895 --> 53:08.397
Just get me out.

53:08.856 --> 53:10.566
Is Stuart in there, too?

53:10.732 --> 53:13.569
No, Snowbell, he's dead.

53:13.652 --> 53:16.113
What? Stuart is dead?

53:16.405 --> 53:17.906
Falcon killed him.

53:18.073 --> 53:20.993
No. He can't be, he's...

53:21.034 --> 53:24.580
I was supposed to protect him.

53:25.747 --> 53:28.584
I wish it was me who had been killed.

53:29.626 --> 53:30.627
Really?

53:30.919 --> 53:35.465
No. But I am very unhappy!

53:57.696 --> 54:01.909
Oh, dear. I'm dumped on a boat.

54:01.992 --> 54:05.996
I'm on a garbage barge. I got to get off.

54:06.830 --> 54:09.791
Hello there!

54:09.875 --> 54:14.838
I'm over here! On the barge! Can you hear me?

54:15.005 --> 54:16.340
Help!

54:16.590 --> 54:19.092
I'm not supposed to be here!

54:19.676 --> 54:21.595
I need to get off!

54:21.970 --> 54:23.931
Help me!

54:24.848 --> 54:26.225
Help!

54:36.652 --> 54:40.239
Rita, hi. I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd get the boys.

54:40.405 --> 54:42.574
- George and Will?
- George and Stuart.

54:42.741 --> 54:45.202
George is here, but I haven't seen Stuart.

54:45.577 --> 54:47.412
But he slept here last night.

54:48.497 --> 54:49.498
No.

54:50.374 --> 54:51.792
George!

54:54.628 --> 54:56.296
What are you going to do now?

54:56.380 --> 54:57.840
Which way's Canada?

55:06.515 --> 55:08.392
This is terrible.

55:09.393 --> 55:11.228
I just want to go home.

55:12.980 --> 55:16.316
I know a Little is supposed
to always see a silver lining.

55:18.193 --> 55:20.737
Maybe this means I'm not really a Little.

55:21.822 --> 55:24.992
Maybe I'm just Stuart Nobody.

55:25.576 --> 55:27.411
Stuart Nothing.

55:43.510 --> 55:45.762
There is no silver lining!

55:51.727 --> 55:54.062
Oh, no. What have I done?

56:11.371 --> 56:13.874
My plane.

56:14.208 --> 56:15.792
My plane!

56:16.043 --> 56:19.213
The silver lining! This is it!

56:26.220 --> 56:29.681
- All right, George, where is he?
- And this time, the truth.

56:29.890 --> 56:31.517
I'm not sure.

56:31.808 --> 56:34.186
It is never okay to lie to your parents.

56:34.228 --> 56:36.522
Is it okay to break a promise to your brother?

56:36.563 --> 56:39.483
It's wrong to promise your brother
you'll lie to your parents.

56:39.566 --> 56:43.570
Listen to the tone of my voice.
Tell us where Stuart is.

56:43.654 --> 56:45.656
It was a promise. Brother to brother.

56:45.739 --> 56:48.408
George, I understand. I have a brother.

56:48.742 --> 56:52.663
But if he was in danger, that would
matter more to me than the promise.

56:52.746 --> 56:57.125
How would we all feel
if anything happened to Stuart?

56:59.253 --> 57:01.171
He's at the Pishkin Building.

57:02.589 --> 57:03.674
- Dad.
- What?

57:03.841 --> 57:07.177
- Am I in trouble?
- No, son. You're in big trouble.

58:44.691 --> 58:48.779
- Mom, Dad, I'm really sorry.
- You should be.

58:48.862 --> 58:53.408
For all we know, Stuart could be out
there now, lying face down with his--

58:54.201 --> 58:57.663
Or, he could be fine.
We don't have to assume the worst.

58:58.038 --> 59:00.207
After all, it's not the Little way.

59:00.374 --> 59:05.170
Yes, you're right. He could be puttering home
right now in his shiny little car.

59:05.504 --> 59:06.839
Smiling and happy.

59:06.922 --> 59:09.216
His whiskers fluttering in the breeze.

59:09.383 --> 59:10.843
- Mom.
- Yes, George.

59:11.051 --> 59:13.178
I don't think he's puttering home.

59:16.431 --> 59:17.850
Who would do this?

59:21.311 --> 59:23.522
Tiny little vandals.

59:25.566 --> 59:27.693
That miserable falcon!

59:28.235 --> 59:31.572
From this day forward, I vow revenge.

59:31.822 --> 59:35.325
If that falcon were here right now,
I'd rip his throat out.

59:35.534 --> 59:37.870
I'd scratch his face off. I'd--

59:40.247 --> 59:41.331
That's him.

59:41.540 --> 59:42.791
Don't hurt me.

59:42.916 --> 59:44.543
Kill the bird, not me.

59:44.751 --> 59:47.212
I'm going to be falcon poop.

59:48.255 --> 59:51.508
Well, well, well. The canary is out of her cage.

59:51.717 --> 59:54.887
And how nice.
She's brought a friend for dinner.

59:55.095 --> 59:58.182
Too bad I don't like canned food.

01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:03.812
Snowbell, get out!

01:00:03.896 --> 01:00:07.232
Can't. Stuck. Too fat!

01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:21.914
Don't do it, Falcon. Or else!

01:00:22.122 --> 01:00:23.707
Do what? What's he doing?

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.000
Or else what?

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:28.754
Or else you'll lose this.

01:00:29.296 --> 01:00:31.381
Put that down, Margalo.

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:35.594
I'm through doing what you tell me to do.
I'm leaving you, Falcon, forever.

01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:39.097
Oh, and what do you think you'll be without me?

01:00:39.806 --> 01:00:41.141
Free.

01:00:43.227 --> 01:00:47.981
Big mistake. I'll be back for you, Fur-ball.

01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:50.484
Don't hurry!

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.254
- Stuart! You're alive!
- So far!

01:01:10.462 --> 01:01:12.047
Where'd you get the plane?

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:13.549
A garbage dump.

01:01:13.799 --> 01:01:15.092
Sorry I asked.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.637
- I hope we're not too late.
- Keep your eyes peeled. He could be anywhere.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.889
Careful now. One step at a time.

01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:24.393
That's it. You're going to make it. Yeah!

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:35.112
I'm alive. I'm alive.

01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:40.784
Stuart! Is that you? Take me with you!

01:01:41.493 --> 01:01:45.205
What about me? How will I get down from here?

01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:50.711
I think this is it. Turn here.

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:51.920
Okey-dokey. No problem.

01:01:58.051 --> 01:01:59.553
Hey, look! It's Stuart.

01:01:59.636 --> 01:02:01.305
Stop the car!

01:02:07.603 --> 01:02:08.896
Stuart!

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.649
Look at that bird. He's bigger than me.

01:02:12.858 --> 01:02:14.693
We got to save him. Come on.

01:02:14.902 --> 01:02:17.529
It's the Littles. I'm saved!

01:02:18.363 --> 01:02:19.656
Wait! It's me!

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:21.366
Follow that flying mouse.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:23.160
- No problem.
- Hey-Little, Ho-Little...

01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:26.288
...Hoo-Little, Hey-Hottle, Ho-Wottle, Wo-Wittle.

01:02:43.931 --> 01:02:45.599
There he is!

01:02:51.063 --> 01:02:54.650
If we get out of this,
I'm sticking to painting and dancing.

01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:59.238
Hey, lady! Get out of the way!

01:03:02.574 --> 01:03:04.034
He's closing in.

01:03:19.633 --> 01:03:20.968
Oh, my goodness.

01:03:27.766 --> 01:03:28.934
Keep it running.

01:03:29.017 --> 01:03:30.769
Okey-dokey. No problem.

01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:43.574
He can't hear you.

01:03:46.952 --> 01:03:48.871
I think we lost him.

01:03:50.455 --> 01:03:51.790
Going up?

01:03:54.376 --> 01:03:56.712
Frederick, I feel so helpless.

01:04:00.632 --> 01:04:02.926
A mouse needs to know his limitations.

01:04:08.265 --> 01:04:09.641
Stuart! Pull up!

01:04:10.017 --> 01:04:11.935
I can't! It's stuck!

01:04:12.102 --> 01:04:13.937
Well, try harder!

01:04:15.147 --> 01:04:17.483
Margalo! Get out! Save yourself!

01:04:17.983 --> 01:04:21.278
No, Stuart! If we go, we go together!

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:26.492
Stuart! Pull up!

01:04:26.783 --> 01:04:29.411
- Pull up, Stuart!
- Stuart, pull up!

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.053
You should've stayed
in your little hole, Mouse-boy.

01:04:48.013 --> 01:04:50.182
Stuart, we can't outrun him.

01:04:50.224 --> 01:04:52.226
Then we'll just have to face him.

01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:55.187
It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.

01:04:55.437 --> 01:04:58.482
But I have to try. I'll be back for you later.

01:04:59.107 --> 01:05:00.442
What do you mean?

01:05:03.487 --> 01:05:05.697
Stuart! Don't do it!

01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:13.789
Party's over, Fur-face.

01:05:22.089 --> 01:05:23.173
What's he doing?

01:05:23.257 --> 01:05:24.508
They'll crash!

01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:26.385
Stuart! Turn! Run away!

01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:43.986
Bye-bye, Birdbrain!

01:05:51.952 --> 01:05:53.704
Oh, dear.

01:05:55.622 --> 01:05:56.999
Got you.

01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:07.092
Can't I get a decent meal in this city?

01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:15.267
Thank you.

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.856
Stuart! Are you okay?

01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:22.774
I am now. Margalo saved me.

01:06:22.983 --> 01:06:24.610
We saved each other.

01:06:24.943 --> 01:06:27.070
What did you think you were doing?

01:06:27.237 --> 01:06:30.699
- You almost gave me a heart attack.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

01:06:30.991 --> 01:06:32.701
- You ran away from home.
- I know.

01:06:32.784 --> 01:06:34.578
And you had George lie to us.

01:06:34.661 --> 01:06:35.662
Yeah.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:39.249
Then why am I so proud of you?

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:42.252
Mrs. Little, this belongs to you.

01:06:44.004 --> 01:06:45.214
My ring.

01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:47.382
Yeah, I took it.

01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:49.468
And now she's giving it back.

01:06:53.055 --> 01:06:55.933
I'm just happy to have all of you back.

01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:02.231
Snowbell!

01:07:02.314 --> 01:07:03.482
You made it.

01:07:03.857 --> 01:07:04.900
Thank goodness you're all right.

01:07:05.192 --> 01:07:09.321
Snowbell, where have you been?

01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:12.241
You wouldn't believe
what Stuart and Margalo have been through.

01:07:13.826 --> 01:07:17.496
You should have seen it.
These two were so brave.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.999
Let's go home.

01:07:24.002 --> 01:07:27.172
And how about me? I played no part in this?

01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:31.677
Well, I have had enough!
I'm staying right here, folks!

01:07:31.844 --> 01:07:35.013
Oh, yeah. You'll never see me again!

01:07:35.389 --> 01:07:37.683
Snow, want some tuna when we get home?

01:07:37.808 --> 01:07:41.270
Tuna? I love these people.

01:07:41.895 --> 01:07:44.690
Wait! Wait for me!

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:53.073
I guess they're flying south for the winter?

01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:54.783
I guess.

01:07:58.203 --> 01:08:02.624
You've always dreamed of going, haven't you?
But Falcon never let you.

01:08:03.542 --> 01:08:07.045
Every year I'd just watch all the other birds go.

01:08:07.254 --> 01:08:09.339
The ones who were free.

01:08:10.424 --> 01:08:11.758
You're free.

01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:15.846
We'd be so far apart.

01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:19.308
It wouldn't change a thing.

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:44.875
Well--

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:49.505
- You're sure of the way? We can call AAA.
- We can get you maps, discount coupons.

01:08:49.587 --> 01:08:53.425
There's a place in South Carolina
where they do the best pecan pie.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:56.178
I'm a bird. Instinct should take over.

01:08:56.595 --> 01:08:58.680
I guess you've waited for this a long time.

01:08:58.764 --> 01:09:01.683
All my life. Only--

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.685
Only what, dear?

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:08.232
Well, now it's not just talk.
Now, it's the real thing.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:09.733
Are you scared?

01:09:10.024 --> 01:09:13.362
The world's pretty big, and I'm pretty small.

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:17.448
Somebody once told me,
"You're as big as you feel".

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:19.952
Just spread your wings...

01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:22.203
...and soar.

01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:25.249
I'll miss you, Stuart.

01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:33.048
I'll miss you, too.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:40.221
I'll miss all of you.

01:09:41.305 --> 01:09:42.975
You, too, Snowbell.

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:45.560
I'm not going to cry.

01:09:54.987 --> 01:09:56.947
Little hi, Little low.

01:09:57.156 --> 01:09:59.491
Little hey, Little ho.

01:10:03.996 --> 01:10:05.164
Stuart?

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:06.415
Yeah, Dad?

01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:08.750
What's the silver lining this time?

01:10:09.835 --> 01:10:11.920
She'll be back in the spring.

01:10:16.925 --> 01:10:18.927
Bye-bye, birdie.

01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:23.599
- Did you hear that?
- Her first words! She spoke!

01:10:23.807 --> 01:10:26.310
- Of course she did.
- I knew she could do it.

01:10:26.185 --> 01:10:29.855
Big deal. When she can fall from a tree
and land on her feet, then I'll be impressed.
