14:58.201 --> 15:00.987
I'm so sorry for your loss.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.513
You know,
Clay loved telling the story

15:05.556 --> 15:08.690
about how you handed him
his ass in the C-17,

15:08.733 --> 15:10.605
when he was just a strap
with Bravo.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.871
He loved you, Lisa.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.830
He loved you.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.225
[crying]

15:25.011 --> 15:27.230
[sobbing]

15:30.494 --> 15:34.498
Intel has vetted
what we got off Khoi in Jordan.

15:35.717 --> 15:39.329
General Rajavi will be traveling
from Tehran

15:39.373 --> 15:41.941
to Mosul, Iraq, in two days.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.812
The brass believe
he's in play there.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.945
Whoop-dee-fucking-doo.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.731
Look, taking him out,
it's an important op.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.605
But maybe this one
is not for Bravo.

15:56.912 --> 15:59.262
We gotta decide
whether or not that, uh,

15:59.306 --> 16:01.656
we want to stand down
and go home.

16:01.699 --> 16:05.703
The only op that
I'm interested in doing

16:05.747 --> 16:07.618
is the one that Clay
tasked us with.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.882
That is being there for Brian...

16:12.058 --> 16:15.278
...and being there for Stella.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.324
I mean, we got the ball
to the goal line.

16:17.367 --> 16:21.154
There is no shame in letting
someone else spike the football.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.504
Family first.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.726
Then it's decided.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.859
I'll get on the horn
with Command.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.214
[knocking]

16:40.825 --> 16:42.610
How you holding up?

16:42.653 --> 16:44.829
I saw Stella.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.962
Made me feel better.
And worse.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.923
Bravo's put a request in
to return home.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.882
Say they're not battle-ready.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.145
Can you blame 'em?

16:56.189 --> 16:58.147
Given their current headspace

16:58.191 --> 17:01.281
and the geopolitical stakes
of this action

17:01.324 --> 17:04.109
against General Rajavi,
I can't say that I disagree.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.026
I feel a "but" coming.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.551
The Agency's taken over
Khoi's digital media

17:11.595 --> 17:13.292
and put out
a disinformation story

17:13.336 --> 17:15.164
about why he never made it
to Shanghai,

17:15.208 --> 17:17.558
but it'll only hold
for a few days.

17:17.601 --> 17:20.430
And when Rajavi catches wind
that we're onto him,

17:20.473 --> 17:21.953
he's gonna park
his ass in Tehran

17:21.997 --> 17:23.215
where we can't reach him.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.915
Meaning there's no time
to spin another team up.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.571
Might be on Bravo's heavy
shoulders to pull this off.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.921
I'm more worried about their
heads than their shoulders.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.142
Clay's loss has gotta be
stirring things up,

17:36.185 --> 17:38.013
especially for Jason and Ray.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.494
Is there something
I'm not aware of?

17:40.537 --> 17:42.278
No, sir.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.411
I just mean it all adds up.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.328
So, you're ordering Bravo to
move forward with the mission?

17:48.371 --> 17:51.200
[sighs]
Well, stakes like these,

17:51.244 --> 17:53.333
call's coming from
above Command.

17:55.552 --> 17:56.988
Which is a good thing, too.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.121
I am so torn up about Clay,

17:59.165 --> 18:01.167
I have no clue
what's best right now.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.703
[Jason sighs]

18:21.274 --> 18:22.971
Look, our request
to make it home

18:23.014 --> 18:24.799
has been denied.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.672
You've gotta be shitting me.

18:28.716 --> 18:31.066
With the tight timeline
and no other assets

18:31.110 --> 18:33.721
in the region,
the op falls on us.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.157
[chuckles]

18:35.201 --> 18:37.159
War fighters over war fighting.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.161
Okay, but our brother
just died, Jace.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.989
We gotta get home to his wife
and his little boy.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.122
Don't you think
I fucking know that, Sonny?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.343
But orders are orders.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.390
Well, fine, I'll just book us
a commercial flight home, then.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.826
You really think Clay
would want us all

18:51.869 --> 18:53.001
to pull a career-ender?

18:53.044 --> 18:55.395
Hey, sooner we knock this out,

18:55.438 --> 18:57.701
the sooner we get to go home,
all right?

18:57.745 --> 18:58.920
Ray, what do we got?

18:58.963 --> 19:01.183
Yeah, okay.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.011
Two afternoons from now,

19:03.054 --> 19:06.884
General Rajavi is set to meet
with a commander of Al-Hashd

19:06.928 --> 19:08.669
in the Bab-al-Saray market
in Mosul.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.846
So, broad daylight in
militia-controlled territory.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.543
-What's not to like?
-JASON: It gets better.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.894
One of his undisclosed
drone bases is in the area.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.201
RAY: We take out the general
and his ISR capability,

19:19.245 --> 19:21.072
we set back Iran's intention
in the region.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.727
-Done.
-A lot of moving parts.

19:23.771 --> 19:26.208
Yeah, two targets,
two different locations.

19:26.252 --> 19:29.168
Which leaves us with one choice.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.518
Abandon our posts,
Bowe Berghdahl-style.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.737
Simultaneous drone strikes.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.392
Call in our drones
to do the heavy lifting,

19:36.436 --> 19:38.394
we come off the sidelines
for battle damage assessment.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.788
We confirm that this dirtbag
of a general's been hit,

19:40.831 --> 19:43.791
fucking eats a hellfire,
we get to go home.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.143
Now, look,
Sonny's on full tilt about Clay.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.406
Maybe I should roll with him,
balance him out?

19:51.451 --> 19:53.235
Yeah, we can't have
any wild cards out there, Jace.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.543
Okay, you, Sonny, and Brock,
you watch the drone fields.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.806
The rest of us will keep
an eye on the general.

20:03.071 --> 20:06.466
We are, uh...
we're gonna toast.

20:15.605 --> 20:19.261
Hey.
You don't have to do that.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.958
Oh, yes, I do.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.013
Hey.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.542
[shuddering]

20:39.586 --> 20:41.762
To Clay Spenser, our, uh...

20:43.242 --> 20:44.982
...our teammate and...

20:46.201 --> 20:47.376
...our brother.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.509
The best of us
don't come home.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.743
Corner's not reserved
for the star pupil, Lieutenant.

21:06.787 --> 21:11.095
[chuckles] Just, um,
feeling outranked, ma'am.

21:11.139 --> 21:14.142
If this op succeeds,
your days of feeling that way

21:14.185 --> 21:15.622
will be numbered.

21:20.191 --> 21:23.412
Admiral Rivas,
you remember Lieutenant Davis.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.589
How could I forget
the officer who told me

21:26.633 --> 21:29.810
inaction against General Rajavi
would invite the next Ukraine?

21:29.853 --> 21:32.682
Well, I admit my messaging
was a little blunt, sir.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.771
Well, it worked.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.860
Thanks to you, we're about
to derail Iran's ambitions

21:36.904 --> 21:39.210
-in the Middle East.
-Let's hope.

21:39.254 --> 21:41.865
I feel like all eyes
in this room are on me.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.346
That's because they are.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.479
All wondering how you
were able to read the tea leaves

21:46.522 --> 21:49.133
when they could not,
and connect General Rajavi

21:49.177 --> 21:50.483
to the Cramptonattack.

21:51.484 --> 21:52.920
Enjoy the moment, Lieutenant.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.012
You're the reason
we're all here.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.380
Havoc, this is 1,
I pass Pat's.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.556
ERIC:
I copy Pat's, 1. Over.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.602
Clay's funeral is in two days.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.647
We do this right,
we'll be back in time.

22:24.691 --> 22:25.953
It all feels so fast.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.216
It'll have been
five days by then;

22:28.259 --> 22:29.478
Stella deserves closure.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.262
What the fuck is closure, huh?

22:32.525 --> 22:33.830
Let's get front-sight focused,
all right?

22:35.441 --> 22:37.617
Let Clay go
until we get through the op.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.408
OMAR:
First deployment, 2007,

22:46.452 --> 22:48.279
lost our 2IC
in a midnight raid,

22:48.323 --> 22:50.804
got sent on a follow-on
a couple hours later.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.849
Yeah, we've all been
through that bullshit.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.242
This is just different.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.026
BROCK: At least
this op makes an impact.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.854
OMAR:
That's right.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.769
Wipe the general off the map,
people's lives are better.

22:59.813 --> 23:02.076
The only lives I'm interested
in making better at this moment

23:02.119 --> 23:03.686
are Stella and Brian's.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.645
You need to clear
your head, Sonny.

23:05.688 --> 23:08.169
Can't roll into an op
with a lit fuse.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.519
Tell you what,
this op goes sideways,

23:10.563 --> 23:13.783
you're gonna want me
to go boom.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.664
Entering Mosul proper
in about ten klicks.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.056
Heads on a swivel, boys.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.797
General's plane lands
in about an hour.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.277
And it's hellfire
shortly after that.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.409
ERIC:
Bravo One, this is Havoc.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.498
Your airstrike has been canked.

23:32.541 --> 23:35.849
Say again, your airstrike
has been called off.

23:35.892 --> 23:39.069
Hold what you got and stand by
for further instructions.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.115
What the fuck now?

23:47.687 --> 23:49.950
I was afraid the Iraqis
would get cold feet.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.865
Citing our history
of drone strikes

23:51.908 --> 23:53.606
causing civilian casualty

23:53.649 --> 23:56.652
feels like an outdated excuse.

23:56.696 --> 24:00.047
Iraq is effectively
a vassal state of Iran.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.832
Authorizing a hit on Rajavi
would stir the pot.

24:02.876 --> 24:05.095
So the general skates.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.662
And he will soon
connect the dots

24:06.706 --> 24:08.577
and realize that we're onto him.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.579
This was our last shot
at Rajavi.

24:10.623 --> 24:13.364
Just because the drone strikes
weren't authorized

24:13.408 --> 24:15.671
doesn't mean we can't
still affect the situation.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.632
We have assets on the ground.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.808
Bravo is there
for battle damage assessment.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.897
They're not prepared
for a kinetic operation.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.290
It's their call,
but if you don't think

24:26.334 --> 24:27.901
your former team is up
to the task,

24:27.944 --> 24:29.729
now's the time to speak up,
Lieutenant.

24:32.645 --> 24:36.126
If anyone can pull it off,
Bravo can, sir.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.356
OMAR:
Where does this put us, boss?

24:48.399 --> 24:50.271
On a flight home,
do not pass "go,"

24:50.314 --> 24:52.012
do not pick up dead general.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.755
[Jason sighs]

24:55.798 --> 24:57.234
Look, the brass doesn't want
to give up

24:57.278 --> 24:59.236
on taking out Rajavi.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.890
If we come up with a plan,
we're clear to Charlie Mike.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.588
Shit, but good idea fairies
want a plan,

25:02.631 --> 25:03.980
let's just say we don't got one.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.373
SONNY: That means
we'll be home in time

25:05.416 --> 25:07.680
for when they put Clay
in the ground.

25:07.723 --> 25:09.029
Uh, if I, if I miss that,

25:09.072 --> 25:10.683
I don't think
I'd ever forgive myself.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.250
JASON: You know, Clay told me,
"If anything goes wrong,

25:13.294 --> 25:15.252
"the worst happens,
I want you to be there

25:15.296 --> 25:16.993
for Stella and my kid."

25:17.037 --> 25:20.170
And you know what, I wasn't,
and that fucking kills me.

25:20.214 --> 25:21.955
But, uh, you know,
missing out on things,

25:21.998 --> 25:24.653
that's part of the job, right?
That's what we do.

25:24.697 --> 25:28.004
Sacrifice to save lives and...
[sighs]

25:28.048 --> 25:30.833
Look, if we don't
take this shot,

25:30.877 --> 25:33.183
more people are gonna die.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.229
SONNY:
What shot, Jace?

25:35.272 --> 25:37.274
We're geared up
to be spectators, okay?

25:37.318 --> 25:39.494
Not to get in the damn ring
and throw haymakers.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.496
We may not be
rolling heavy, Sonny,

25:41.540 --> 25:43.672
but it's not our equipment
that makes us elite.

25:47.154 --> 25:48.372
JASON:
Look, man.

25:50.374 --> 25:53.421
The families of those
dead American sailors

25:53.464 --> 25:55.554
are hurting just like us.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.948
Maybe, you know,
a little vengeance...

26:00.167 --> 26:02.343
...just might give 'em
a little comfort.

26:03.997 --> 26:06.913
Yeah, I was with Clay when
we heard about the Crampton.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.567
He thought the world
should know what happens

26:08.610 --> 26:10.220
when you poke the bear.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.921
So fuck it.
I'm in, brother.

26:16.226 --> 26:18.446
Yeah, all right, listen,
when the general lands,

26:18.489 --> 26:20.100
we're gonna interdict
the convoy.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.058
We're gonna hit 'em hard
and we're gonna hit 'em fast.

26:22.102 --> 26:23.407
He'll be keeping
a low profile

26:23.451 --> 26:25.148
with a limited
security footprint.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.368
All right, it's a fair fight
on the ground.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.109
But they get those drones
up in the sky...

26:29.152 --> 26:30.371
Stand by to die.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.726
So, we hit the aerial assets,
too, like we planned.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.817
Intel on drone site said
there's minimal security, right?

26:42.992 --> 26:44.907
Sonny and I will improvise
a way to take them out

26:44.951 --> 26:46.648
while the rest of the team
hunts Rajavi.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.215
Four rifles against the general
