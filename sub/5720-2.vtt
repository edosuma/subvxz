<i>Previously on</i> Madam Secretary...

00:04.453 --> 00:05.243
Elizabeth, you know

00:05.244 --> 00:07.173
- Craig Sterling.
- Madam Secretary.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.141
ELIZABETH: <i>Nakedly ambitious,</i>

00:08.143 --> 00:09.310
<i>self-serving,</i>

00:09.311 --> 00:10.377
obstructionist.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.779
All suit and no substance.

00:11.780 --> 00:14.477
I can't believe Conrad would
make that appointment

00:14.478 --> 00:15.610
without consulting with me.

00:15.611 --> 00:17.212
The president of the United States

00:17.213 --> 00:19.147
can do whatever the hell he wants.

00:19.148 --> 00:20.281
I'll be your main contact at DIA.

00:20.282 --> 00:21.591
<i>We have an eye on one of your students.</i>

00:21.592 --> 00:23.294
<i>He's training to serve
under General Doroshevich,</i>

00:23.295 --> 00:25.262
one of the highest-ranking
members of the Russian military

00:25.263 --> 00:27.841
and a close advisor to President Ostrov.

00:27.842 --> 00:29.736
- HENRY: <i>Dmitri Petrov.</i>
- JANE: <i>I want you to bring him in.</i>

00:29.737 --> 00:31.453
You mean recruit him.
And be his handler.

00:31.454 --> 00:34.121
- What? No. Wait. No.
- Henry, we need this.

00:34.122 --> 00:37.490
Russian continues to be our
next real nuclear threat.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.503
All right, after we're done
with the junction boxes,

00:48.504 --> 00:50.805
we can go ahead and start
installing the conduit supports

00:50.806 --> 00:51.973
tomorrow, okay?

00:51.974 --> 00:53.241
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

00:53.242 --> 00:56.462
- Good night, Farid.
- Thank you. So long.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:12.327 --> 01:15.163
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

01:15.164 --> 01:17.464
(groaning)

01:19.233 --> 01:21.535
(yelling)

01:22.970 --> 01:25.706
Gone M.I.A. where in the world

01:25.707 --> 01:28.643
is Russian President Pavel Ostrov?

01:28.644 --> 01:30.878
The mercurial leader has not been seen

01:30.879 --> 01:34.215
in public for a week now,
leading to speculation

01:34.216 --> 01:37.785
of a secret tummy tuck,
to a rendezvous in Gustat

01:37.786 --> 01:41.355
for the birth of his love
child, to a bloody coup...

01:41.356 --> 01:42.667
I'm going with tummy tuck.

01:42.668 --> 01:43.935
Vanity. That's always a good option.

01:43.936 --> 01:45.737
- Didn't you go hunting with him, Dad?
- Yeah.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.272
- Maybe a Siberian tiger got him.
- Yeah.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.717
Or maybe the Russian Air
Force One went missing.

01:52.941 --> 01:53.718
Too soon?

01:53.719 --> 01:54.885
Let's give it a year.

01:54.886 --> 01:56.721
So what do you think about Ostrov, Mom?

01:56.722 --> 01:57.922
Something salacious?

01:57.923 --> 01:59.657
I think that

01:59.658 --> 02:02.593
dictators do whatever
the hell they want...

02:02.594 --> 02:04.462
and like it when the world worries.

02:04.463 --> 02:05.563
Well, I'm sure your buddy,

02:05.564 --> 02:06.964
the Russian foreign minister guy, knows.

02:06.965 --> 02:08.199
STEVIE: Maybe Mom knows

02:08.199 --> 02:09.400
and she can't tell us.

02:09.401 --> 02:11.502
Ooh, you really think
she's that good a liar?

02:11.503 --> 02:13.003
She lies for a living.

02:13.004 --> 02:14.472
Oh... not true.

02:14.473 --> 02:16.040
I'm starting to feel a little attacked.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.742
Then it's a good thing we have
a peer mediator in the family.

02:18.743 --> 02:20.277
Talking stick, anyone?

02:20.278 --> 02:24.214
Same one I've used to settle
many a disagreement at school.

02:24.215 --> 02:27.216
Okay. You're a loser.

02:27.584 --> 02:29.019
Hey, it works.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.721
Yeah, it does, just not
on the brain-dead.

02:30.722 --> 02:32.589
Okay, you guys, go to
school, please. Get out.

02:32.590 --> 02:34.458
You're so lucky I'm still driving you.

02:34.459 --> 02:35.793
- Bye. Love you.
- Please don't.

02:35.794 --> 02:37.394
- Bye. I love you, too. Bye.
- Bye.

02:37.395 --> 02:39.963
See you. Um,

02:39.964 --> 02:42.232
actually, Stevie, you want
to hang back for a second?

02:42.233 --> 02:44.067
Yeah. Oh. Um...

02:44.068 --> 02:46.336
I'm sorry that I said
that you lie for a living.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.371
It's not that.

02:47.372 --> 02:49.573
Just, will you take a look at this?

02:49.574 --> 02:51.542
Yeah. What is it?

02:51.543 --> 02:53.477
It's a lab report.

02:53.478 --> 02:57.080
Um, we had the powder in
the bag you gave me tested.

02:57.081 --> 02:58.749
It came back positive for heroin.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.284
Yeah, well, I told you that Harrison

03:00.285 --> 03:01.818
said it was an old stash.

03:01.819 --> 03:03.253
Yeah, we just wanted to make sure.

03:03.254 --> 03:04.888
There's also... (clears his throat)

03:04.889 --> 03:07.156
There's also this.

03:10.327 --> 03:12.496
A toxicology report.

03:12.497 --> 03:14.464
Follicle analysis.

03:14.465 --> 03:17.125
We had the hair from your brush tested.

03:21.371 --> 03:23.306
You thought I was doing heroin?

03:23.307 --> 03:24.874
Honestly, we didn't know what to think,

03:24.875 --> 03:26.209
but can you really blame us?

03:26.210 --> 03:27.444
It came back clean, you know.

03:27.445 --> 03:30.588
Although, you are a
little calcium deficient.

03:30.589 --> 03:32.584
You might want to think about
switching back to regular milk.

03:32.585 --> 03:33.347
- That's not...
- I'm just saying...

03:33.348 --> 03:35.153
This is such a violation of my trust.

03:35.154 --> 03:37.054
Well, you violated our trust.

03:37.055 --> 03:39.023
You-you lied to us
about dating Harrison.

03:39.024 --> 03:41.392
(laughing): Okay.

03:41.393 --> 03:43.894
I can date anyone that I want.

03:43.895 --> 03:45.930
Well, but, um, he's not anyone.

03:45.931 --> 03:47.898
He's my boss's son.

03:47.899 --> 03:49.500
- Okay, okay. Is that all?
- No.

03:49.501 --> 03:51.001
Actually, now that we know the heroin

03:51.002 --> 03:52.737
is real, someone's got to tell his parents.

03:52.738 --> 03:54.638
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? What?

03:54.639 --> 03:56.140
If Harrison is using, do you really

03:56.141 --> 03:57.541
want it on your conscience

03:57.542 --> 03:59.009
that you didn't notify them?

03:59.010 --> 04:01.145
And-and if, God forbid,
he winds up OD'ing again...

04:01.146 --> 04:02.446
We think it would be best

04:02.447 --> 04:04.815
if you let him come clean
with his parents first.

04:04.816 --> 04:07.476
Short of that, we'll go
to them this afternoon.

04:10.054 --> 04:13.123
Fine.

04:13.124 --> 04:15.124
I'll tell him.

04:19.228 --> 04:21.498
JAY: <i>And this is security
camera footage of the grab.</i>

04:21.499 --> 04:22.700
That's Tom Garrity.

04:22.701 --> 04:24.968
ELIZABETH: What about
his security detail?

04:24.969 --> 04:27.137
Two APPF guards outside the building

04:27.138 --> 04:28.472
on the perimeter of the site?

04:28.473 --> 04:30.507
The kidnappers took Garrity
out the opposite side.

04:30.508 --> 04:31.775
DAISY: We're monitoring Taliban,

04:31.776 --> 04:34.545
ISIS and all the usual
radical Web sites.

04:34.546 --> 04:36.580
Pretty audacious, grabbing
a state department employee

04:36.581 --> 04:38.015
right in the middle of Kabul.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.283
Let's put our embassy there

04:39.284 --> 04:42.486
and all diplomatic outposts
in country on high alert.

04:42.487 --> 04:43.687
Quietly.

04:43.688 --> 04:45.489
And if anyone asks why?

04:45.490 --> 04:46.790
Just say it's a drill or something.

04:46.791 --> 04:49.459
We want to keep our options
open until we know more.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.361
Thank you, everybody.

04:51.362 --> 04:53.597
Ma'am, you have the merchant
marine event this afternoon.

04:53.598 --> 04:55.065
You wanted me to remind you

04:55.066 --> 04:57.000
that Secretary Albright will be there.

04:57.001 --> 04:58.135
Right. I, um...

04:58.136 --> 05:00.504
I want to wear that
pin that she gave me.

05:00.505 --> 05:02.105
Yes, ma'am.

05:02.106 --> 05:05.242
You'll be laying a wreath with
Russian Ambassador Zinchenko

05:05.243 --> 05:08.678
honoring U.S.-Russian
cooperation during World War II.

05:08.679 --> 05:11.948
Oh, maybe the ambassador knows
where his fearless leader is.

05:11.949 --> 05:14.618
Oh, well, uh, short of that,

05:14.619 --> 05:18.088
the White House would like
a revised write-up of our

05:18.089 --> 05:20.056
- post-Ostrov Russia plan.
- (laughs)

05:20.057 --> 05:21.791
(groans)

05:21.792 --> 05:25.028
And, uh, you're here to complain
about that assignment, Jay?

05:25.029 --> 05:27.330
They want a joint report with DOD.

05:27.331 --> 05:29.799
Defense is gonna advocate
taking the opportunity

05:29.800 --> 05:32.702
to roll back Russian aggression
with some aggression of our own.

05:32.703 --> 05:33.903
Exactly.

05:33.904 --> 05:36.406
Provoking the second biggest
nuclear power on Earth

05:36.407 --> 05:38.041
as it descends into chaos.

05:38.042 --> 05:39.609
What could possibly go wrong?

05:39.610 --> 05:41.611
I may not be the right guy to represent

05:41.612 --> 05:42.879
the department, ma'am.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.514
I'm not agreeing to anything
moronically provocative.

05:44.515 --> 05:46.983
Sounds like a good policy.

05:46.984 --> 05:49.852
I want to see my kid grow up.

05:49.853 --> 05:52.120
Me, too.

05:53.356 --> 05:55.690
I think you're the guy for the job.

05:57.527 --> 05:59.529
Okay, then.

05:59.530 --> 06:01.564
Thank you.

06:01.565 --> 06:03.365
Madam Secretary.

06:10.273 --> 06:13.108
- (knocking)
- HENRY: <i> Yeah.</i>

06:14.176 --> 06:16.379
Dmitri. Come on in.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.446
What can I do for you?

06:19.915 --> 06:22.785
I am on my way to the
commandant's office.

06:22.786 --> 06:25.420
I must withdraw from the War College.

06:26.222 --> 06:27.490
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:27.491 --> 06:29.525
Well, do you mind if I ask why?

06:29.526 --> 06:31.026
(sighs)

06:31.027 --> 06:35.631
My sister Talia... uh, she is ill. Cancer.

06:35.632 --> 06:36.866
Oh, no.

06:36.867 --> 06:38.968
Our parents are gone, so...

06:38.969 --> 06:41.337
I must make sure she is cared for.

06:41.338 --> 06:43.205
Of course, of course.

06:43.206 --> 06:44.607
Well, I-I want you to know

06:44.608 --> 06:47.476
that I greatly appreciate
your perspective in class.

06:47.477 --> 06:49.278
I just finished reading your

06:49.279 --> 06:51.513
religious conflicts with
military duty paper,

06:51.514 --> 06:56.618
and it is... a smart,
original take on a very

06:56.619 --> 06:58.454
complex subject.

06:58.455 --> 07:00.856
You'll-you'll be missed.
You really will, by everyone.

07:00.857 --> 07:03.792
My best wishes for you and your sister.

07:03.793 --> 07:07.161
Thank you. Thank you.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.503
(door opens, closes)

07:14.504 --> 07:16.271
Tom Garrity's wife Emma got worried

07:16.272 --> 07:18.340
when he didn't call
the kids this morning.

07:18.341 --> 07:20.175
She contacted the embassy in Kabul,

07:20.176 --> 07:23.679
and the deputy chief of
mission kicked her over to us.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.080
- Tell her the truth.
- Right.

07:25.081 --> 07:27.449
- But ask for her discretion.
- Of course.

07:27.450 --> 07:28.717
- For her husband's sake.
- Yeah.

07:28.718 --> 07:30.417
Madam Secretary.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.255
We just received a video

07:33.256 --> 07:35.157
of the kidnappers' demands
via encrypted e-mail.

07:35.158 --> 07:37.959
Why didn't they just
post it on a Web site

07:37.960 --> 07:40.160
like every other
self-respecting kidnapper?

07:40.161 --> 07:40.862
Watch.

07:40.863 --> 07:42.864
My name is Tom Garrity.

07:42.865 --> 07:45.867
I'm an American State Department
foreign service officer

07:45.868 --> 07:47.936
stationed in Kabul.

07:47.937 --> 07:50.572
U.S. government has gravely
wronged my captors,

07:50.573 --> 07:53.742
and I will be killed if
you don't make it right.

07:53.743 --> 07:54.976
We demand to talk

07:54.977 --> 07:57.645
to Secretary of State
Elizabeth McCord directly

07:57.646 --> 08:00.115
by midnight in Kabul tonight.

08:00.116 --> 08:03.718
Do as we say, or he dies.

08:03.719 --> 08:06.521
That's four hours from now.

08:06.522 --> 08:11.024
Why aren't they asking for
money or a prisoner exchange?

08:11.826 --> 08:14.761
Why the hell do they want to talk to me?

08:15.830 --> 08:19.234
JANE: Dmitri's story checks out.

08:19.235 --> 08:21.135
His sister Talia was admitted

08:21.136 --> 08:23.838
to Muromskaya Hospital
with advanced fibrosarcoma

08:23.839 --> 08:25.039
of the bone.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.307
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:26.308 --> 08:28.543
It's bad luck.

08:28.544 --> 08:31.379
For who? For us, or for Dmitri's sister?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.113
Both.

08:34.248 --> 08:37.518
So I assume you'll want to
focus on Ivan Kolashkov again?

08:37.519 --> 08:40.321
- Yes.
- I still have reservations.

08:40.322 --> 08:41.621
Of course you do.

08:41.623 --> 08:43.357
Let me rephrase.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.393
I won't do it.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.628
You threaten to expose
he's gay to his superiors,

08:47.629 --> 08:48.829
who knows what he'll do?

08:48.830 --> 08:50.498
It's just too volatile.

08:50.499 --> 08:51.832
The DNI needs a Russian asset

08:51.833 --> 08:53.200
with access to General Doroshevich.

08:53.201 --> 08:54.402
It's a top priority now,

08:54.403 --> 08:56.537
especially with all
this Ostrov business.

08:56.538 --> 09:00.140
Ivan and Dmitri are both
in his chain of command.

09:01.342 --> 09:04.478
Maybe there's still a way
to make it work with Dmitri.

09:04.479 --> 09:06.747
LUCY: <i>The president's expecting you,</i>

09:06.748 --> 09:08.582
Madam Secretary. Please go right in.

09:08.583 --> 09:10.151
- Thanks, Lucy.
- Bess.

09:10.152 --> 09:11.585
Hi. We meeting somewhere else?

09:11.586 --> 09:13.754
No, we have a cyber security briefing.

09:13.755 --> 09:15.189
How's it going with that?

09:15.190 --> 09:17.458
- They're still tearing my plane apart.
- We should go, sir.

09:17.459 --> 09:18.726
- Yeah.
- Um, I'll walk with you.

09:18.727 --> 09:20.394
Uh, not necessary.
Craig will fill you in.

09:20.395 --> 09:21.894
Uh, use my office.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.366
ELIZABETH: <i>Where are we, Admiral?</i>

09:25.367 --> 09:28.202
Ma'am, so far, the
investigation has revealed

09:28.203 --> 09:31.071
that Garrity was taken in a secure zone,

09:31.072 --> 09:34.942
requiring a key card swipe to enter.

09:34.943 --> 09:36.310
So they stole them?

09:36.311 --> 09:38.579
Yes, the key cards
belong to three Afghans

09:38.580 --> 09:40.881
who are contracting for the U.S.

09:40.882 --> 09:42.549
Are they dead?

09:42.550 --> 09:44.484
They and their families are M.I.A.

09:44.485 --> 09:47.788
Bodies were likely
dumped outside the city.

09:47.789 --> 09:51.625
It's an awful lot of work to
grab one low-value American.

09:51.626 --> 09:53.659
What are we missing?

09:55.629 --> 09:58.165
Well...

09:58.166 --> 10:01.001
I guess they'll have
to tell us themselves.

10:01.002 --> 10:03.022
Absolutely not. (clears his throat)

10:03.837 --> 10:05.205
Excuse me?

10:05.206 --> 10:06.973
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.408
Talking isn't negotiating.

10:08.409 --> 10:10.343
Well, I've already advised
the president on this,

10:10.344 --> 10:12.712
and he agreed. We're not
giving in to their demand.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.947
Did you advice the president

10:13.948 --> 10:15.949
we might gain valuable
Intel by engaging them?

10:15.950 --> 10:17.183
I understand

10:17.184 --> 10:19.619
your sympathies, given that
Garrity is one of yours...

10:19.620 --> 10:22.322
Garrity is an American citizen.

10:22.323 --> 10:25.225
I don't need your understanding.

10:25.226 --> 10:27.059
Ever.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.730
Please keep me informed, Ellen.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.944
Yes, ma'am.

10:33.945 --> 10:40.203

10:54.447 --> 10:55.289
NADINE: Madam Secretary.

10:55.290 --> 10:57.056
How'd it go with Garrity's wife?

10:57.057 --> 10:59.158
Uh, she's devastated, but she gets it.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.061
There's been a change to the
merchant marines ceremony

11:02.062 --> 11:03.629
this afternoon.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.065
Foreign Minister Gorev
will now be attending.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.366
Since when?

11:07.367 --> 11:10.036
We were just informed he's
on a plane from Moscow.

11:10.037 --> 11:13.139
Does he have any other business in town?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.673
Nothing official.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.842
It's hard to believe there's
anything wrong with Ostrov

11:16.843 --> 11:19.045
if Gorev's leaving
Russia, but then again,

11:19.046 --> 11:21.347
it has been a very strange day.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.616
Let's see if I can get
some time alone with him.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.083
Yes, ma'am.

11:28.114 --> 11:29.103
(over phone): Hey, it's Stevie.

11:29.104 --> 11:30.838
You can leave a message, but you really

11:30.839 --> 11:32.005
- should be texting me.
- (beep)

11:32.006 --> 11:34.808
Hey, sweetie. Um, I
already tried texting.

11:34.809 --> 11:36.877
I stopped by Georgetown
to take you to lunch,

11:36.878 --> 11:39.012
but you weren't in your econ class.

11:39.013 --> 11:41.281
Look, I'm sorry things
got heated this morning.

11:41.282 --> 11:44.517
Would you please give me a call?
I love you. Bye.

11:46.787 --> 11:50.524
(indistinct sportscast playing on TV)

11:50.525 --> 11:53.025
(people cheering)

11:56.430 --> 11:57.597
Professor.

11:57.598 --> 11:59.232
You got a minute?

11:59.233 --> 12:01.802
Uh, of course, yeah. My
flight isn't until tomorrow.

12:01.803 --> 12:03.402
Oh, good.

12:06.439 --> 12:08.208
I want to talk about your sister.

12:08.209 --> 12:09.875
Okay.

12:12.078 --> 12:15.849
What if there was something
we could do to help her?

12:15.850 --> 12:17.817
But-but she's already in hospital.

12:17.818 --> 12:20.085
No. I-I mean a cure.

12:23.156 --> 12:26.659
There's a drug trial happening
right now in Stockholm.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.762
It's showing very promising results

12:28.763 --> 12:31.363
in young fibrosarcoma
patients like your sister.

12:33.066 --> 12:37.069
I didn't tell you she has
fibrosarcoma. What is this?

12:38.872 --> 12:42.208
My government can get
Talia a spot in the trial

12:42.209 --> 12:44.869
if you're willing to work with us.

12:45.545 --> 12:47.080
Work...

12:47.081 --> 12:48.548
Do you understand what I'm saying?

12:48.549 --> 12:51.417
Oh, my God.

12:51.418 --> 12:55.188
Oh, my God, you-you are
asking me to be a spy.

12:55.189 --> 12:57.657
Look at me. I'm offering you a chance

12:57.658 --> 12:59.135
to save your sister's life.

12:59.136 --> 13:00.059
No, they will kill me, okay?

13:00.060 --> 13:01.704
They'll never know you had
anything to do with it.

13:01.705 --> 13:02.806
How do you know my comrades

13:02.807 --> 13:04.040
- are not listening to us now?
- Because we're careful,

13:04.041 --> 13:05.641
that's why. They had the
room swept for bugs

13:05.642 --> 13:07.043
- while you were at lunch.
- Whoa, whoa, stop.

13:07.044 --> 13:08.377
- We're very good at protecting...
- S-Stop.

13:08.378 --> 13:11.213
This-this is why you give me
good grades, praise my work.

13:11.214 --> 13:13.416
No. I chose you because of your work.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.185
You want a functional
democracy in Russia

13:16.186 --> 13:17.920
more than any officer
in the Russian army.

13:17.921 --> 13:20.923
This is how we get there.

13:20.924 --> 13:22.825
By betraying my country.

13:22.826 --> 13:26.362
The architect of the Soviet Union,

13:26.363 --> 13:27.897
Vladimir Lenin himself,

13:27.898 --> 13:30.699
said, "Sometimes history needs a push."

13:30.700 --> 13:32.347
Your country's current
aggression will only

13:32.348 --> 13:35.404
lead to a further crippled
economy and endless wars.

13:35.405 --> 13:37.006
You know that.
But if you work with us,

13:37.007 --> 13:39.108
we can give Russia the push it needs

13:39.109 --> 13:41.075
to ensure a better future.

13:42.378 --> 13:44.480
No.

13:44.481 --> 13:46.648
No, you misjudge me.

13:46.649 --> 13:48.684
I would never do this.

13:48.685 --> 13:50.052
What about your sister?

13:50.053 --> 13:51.386
She is patriot.

13:51.387 --> 13:53.621
She loves Mother Russia.

13:56.191 --> 13:58.526
You cannot use her like some pawn.

14:02.130 --> 14:05.000
We have a couple minutes, ma'am.

14:05.001 --> 14:06.667
Thank you.

14:08.170 --> 14:09.871
Minister Gorev.

14:09.872 --> 14:11.306
- Secretary McCord.
- Welcome.

14:11.307 --> 14:14.009
I didn't know that you were coming.

14:14.010 --> 14:16.545
I was very surprised... pleasantly.

14:16.546 --> 14:18.246
Thank you. I wanted to
join you in commemorating

14:18.247 --> 14:20.782
our historic alliance against fascism.

14:20.783 --> 14:23.151
And it's a chance to see my
beautiful daughter, Olga.

14:23.152 --> 14:24.419
Papa.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.321
Olga, it's very nice to meet you.

14:26.322 --> 14:28.557
I understand that you recently started

14:28.558 --> 14:30.625
at Harvard Business School?

14:30.626 --> 14:33.028
Indeed. You talk about me at work.

14:33.029 --> 14:35.196
Talking about our families
is a good ice-breaker.

14:35.197 --> 14:37.132
Yes, it's often

14:37.133 --> 14:39.834
the only pleasant things we
have to say to each other.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.136
Really?

14:43.271 --> 14:45.773
(playing somber melody)

15:00.755 --> 15:03.391
So, you want to tell me

15:03.392 --> 15:06.861
if we should be worried
about President Ostrov?

15:06.862 --> 15:09.530
Will you believe me if I say no?

15:09.531 --> 15:13.868
Well, I'd like to think that
we've built up some trust.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.537
As do I.

15:16.538 --> 15:19.907
I heard about your foreign
service officer in Afghanistan.

15:19.908 --> 15:22.977
Really?

15:22.978 --> 15:25.146
Terrible business.

15:25.147 --> 15:27.948
GRU may have some information.

15:31.152 --> 15:33.154
Huh.

15:33.155 --> 15:35.455
Well...

15:37.058 --> 15:39.160
...wonder what it will cost me.

15:39.161 --> 15:41.428
Mm.

15:43.864 --> 15:46.132
(band continues playing)

15:47.668 --> 15:49.235
Mm...

15:51.005 --> 15:52.840
Excuse me, Madam Secretary.

15:52.841 --> 15:55.176
Madam Secretary.

15:55.177 --> 15:56.310
Do you have a minute?

15:56.311 --> 15:58.212
- Yes, of course.
- May I?

15:58.213 --> 15:59.747
- Yes, ma'am.
- Great. Okay.

15:59.748 --> 16:02.416
ELIZABETH: <i>Conrad's all
about his new golden boy,</i>

16:02.417 --> 16:04.618
and I'm stuck playing second fiddle.

16:04.619 --> 16:08.622
More like they took my fiddle
and gave it to Craig Sterling.

16:08.623 --> 16:10.624
So are you telling me

16:10.625 --> 16:13.160
that the president has given you

16:13.161 --> 16:15.461
the Heisman?

16:16.263 --> 16:17.931
Yes. Yes.

16:17.932 --> 16:20.000
Which is pretty galling, considering

16:20.001 --> 16:23.437
that I-I didn't even want the
stupid job in the first place.

16:23.438 --> 16:25.272
No offense.

16:25.273 --> 16:27.007
It's a tough job, there's no question.

16:27.008 --> 16:29.409
But I loved it, and I suspect

16:29.410 --> 16:30.711
that you do, too.

16:30.712 --> 16:32.746
Well, admittedly, it has grown on me.

16:32.747 --> 16:34.748
But now that I feel like
I've been relegated

16:34.749 --> 16:37.484
to the outer sanctum, I...

16:37.485 --> 16:39.553
How do I get back in?

16:39.554 --> 16:41.555
You do know about my Doability Doctrine?

16:41.556 --> 16:43.590
I do. "Where our interests are clear,

16:43.591 --> 16:45.459
"our values are at stake

16:45.460 --> 16:47.094
"and we can make a difference,

16:47.095 --> 16:48.762
we must act and we must lead."

16:48.763 --> 16:50.101
Right. And that

16:50.102 --> 16:52.336
doesn't apply just to
international politics.

16:52.337 --> 16:55.005
It applies to office politics, too.

16:55.006 --> 16:58.642
Look, there's plenty of room
in the world for mediocre men.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.846
There is no room for mediocre women.

17:01.847 --> 17:04.248
And so you have to lead.

17:04.249 --> 17:06.584
That's a little difficult

17:06.585 --> 17:08.551
now that the president has...

17:08.553 --> 17:11.922
obviously made up his mind and
gone along with Sterling.

17:11.923 --> 17:13.357
If you're gonna go down,

17:13.358 --> 17:15.059
then you've got to fight. Hard.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.728
And you got to hit him where it hurts.

17:17.729 --> 17:19.063
Oh, my God.

17:19.064 --> 17:22.165
I hope I never get on your bad side.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.367
So, listen, let me call Condi

17:24.368 --> 17:26.703
- and let's grab lunch.
- Okay.

17:26.704 --> 17:28.971
Alexis, let's go.

17:33.110 --> 17:35.112
Harrison.

17:35.113 --> 17:37.648
Dr. McCord. Uh, I was
hoping Stevie was here.

17:37.649 --> 17:39.950
Did you guys talk today?

17:39.951 --> 17:43.220
No. She's not answering
my calls or texts,

17:43.221 --> 17:45.422
hence the desperate
showing up at your house.

17:45.423 --> 17:48.692
Well, she's not here.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.394
Okay.

17:50.395 --> 17:52.629
Uh... sorry to bother you.

17:52.630 --> 17:54.798
Actually, why don't you come in?

17:54.799 --> 17:58.100
There's something you
and I need to talk about.

17:59.503 --> 18:01.270
Come in.

18:05.976 --> 18:07.811
Okay, thanks.

18:07.812 --> 18:11.414
Madam Secretary, Admiral Hill
is sending new security video

18:11.415 --> 18:12.882
of the Garrity abduction.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.485
It's ten minutes until
the kidnappers' deadline.

18:15.486 --> 18:17.953
Let's-let's pull it up.

18:19.823 --> 18:21.658
BLAKE: The guy's fighting for his life.

18:21.659 --> 18:25.093
ELIZABETH: You would be, too.
But then he stops.

18:25.929 --> 18:27.664
- Uh, play that back.
- Yeah.

18:27.665 --> 18:29.865
Here's the other camera.

18:34.771 --> 18:36.906
He has to know, if
he gets in that car,

18:36.907 --> 18:40.475
he's... done. So why give in?

18:41.744 --> 18:44.046
Because he knows them.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.450
That's why they had government I.D.'s

18:47.451 --> 18:50.953
and knew their way around a secure area.

18:50.954 --> 18:52.922
And that's why their
families aren't home.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.324
They're not terrorists, they...

18:55.325 --> 18:57.093
They didn't kill the Afghans

18:57.094 --> 18:59.862
that work for the U.S.
and steal their I.D.'s.

18:59.863 --> 19:01.964
They are them.

19:01.965 --> 19:03.866
But why take Garrity hostage?

19:03.867 --> 19:05.868
No idea. Why don't you

19:05.869 --> 19:08.371
get him on the phone and I'll ask him.

19:08.372 --> 19:09.805
Uh... president said not to.

19:09.806 --> 19:11.786
You want to check with him first?

19:13.342 --> 19:14.977
Definitely.

19:14.978 --> 19:16.946
But we don't have time, so...

19:16.947 --> 19:19.247
would you just do that, okay?

19:24.320 --> 19:26.388
Are you sure it's them, ma'am?

19:26.389 --> 19:28.890
65%.

19:31.827 --> 19:34.128
Make the call.

19:43.133 --> 19:44.501
Does dialing make me an accessory

19:44.502 --> 19:46.180
- to presidential insubordination?
- Yes.

19:46.181 --> 19:47.604
- Hurry up, please.
- I'm... trying.

19:47.605 --> 19:48.465
It didn't go through.

19:48.466 --> 19:51.539
What do you... what do you
mean, it didn't go through?

19:51.540 --> 19:52.539
I don't know. I'm gonna try again.

19:52.540 --> 19:52.776
We have two minutes

19:52.777 --> 19:53.821
until the kidnappers' deadline.

19:53.822 --> 19:55.278
I-I'm sure the network
is just overwhelmed.

19:55.279 --> 19:56.095
Hold on.

19:56.096 --> 19:59.206
Seriously? What, do we
need to upgrade our plan?

19:59.207 --> 20:01.108
- What is happening?
- I don't know. Hold on.

20:01.109 --> 20:02.376
Here's the file for the contractors.

20:02.377 --> 20:05.178
Let me see their I.D. photos, please.

20:05.179 --> 20:07.280
Let's hope this is who
we're gonna be speaking to.

20:07.281 --> 20:09.448
It's going through.

20:10.350 --> 20:12.486
Come on.

20:12.487 --> 20:14.721
Ma'am, it's them.

20:14.722 --> 20:16.089
Secretary McCord,

20:16.090 --> 20:17.224
we didn't think you'd call.

20:17.225 --> 20:18.991
I need to see Garrity.

20:22.429 --> 20:23.630
How you doing, Tom?

20:23.631 --> 20:25.865
Tell my wife and kids I love them.

20:25.866 --> 20:29.469
Why are you guys doing this?
You're on our side.

20:29.470 --> 20:33.473
We have worked for the United
States military for 11 years.

20:33.474 --> 20:36.409
Your people promised we'd get
visas to bring our families

20:36.410 --> 20:40.113
to the U.S., but we are always denied.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.982
Now the Taliban is
threatening to kill us

20:42.983 --> 20:45.652
and our families because we helped you.

20:45.653 --> 20:48.488
They posted night letters
to our doors last week

20:48.489 --> 20:50.290
saying they would cut
our children's throats

20:50.291 --> 20:52.058
in front of us first.

20:52.059 --> 20:54.527
We asked the American
embassy for protection,

20:54.528 --> 20:56.529
but they turned us away.

20:56.530 --> 21:00.399
You made us do this. We had no choice.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.036
What do you want?

21:03.037 --> 21:04.737
We know we are criminals now.

21:04.738 --> 21:07.240
And we accept going
to prison in America.

21:07.241 --> 21:09.275
We want visas

21:09.276 --> 21:11.110
and transport for our wives and children

21:11.111 --> 21:13.880
so they can live in America
as we were promised.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.181
When you can prove

21:15.182 --> 21:17.984
that our families are safe in America,

21:17.985 --> 21:20.352
then we will free Mr. Garrity.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.055
MATT: <i>August 2014,</i>

21:23.056 --> 21:26.893
January 2015 and,
finally, two months ago.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.061
They were rejected seven times.

21:29.062 --> 21:31.163
They hit all the benchmarks for visas...

21:31.164 --> 21:33.132
recommendation letters
from U.S. commanders,

21:33.133 --> 21:35.134
proof that they received
a credible threat

21:35.135 --> 21:36.635
as a result of their employment.

21:36.636 --> 21:38.604
No blemishes on any of their records.

21:38.605 --> 21:39.939
Seem like stand-up guys.

21:39.940 --> 21:42.475
Not withstanding kidnapping
and threatening to kill Garrity.

21:42.476 --> 21:43.909
So why were they denied?

21:43.910 --> 21:46.245
NADINE: In 2008, an Afghan contractor

21:46.246 --> 21:50.115
for the U.S. ended up on
the terrorist watchlist.

21:50.116 --> 21:52.051
Lawmakers went crazy.

21:52.052 --> 21:54.453
The intelligence
community put the brakes

21:54.454 --> 21:58.424
on virtually every visa
from Afghanistan and Iraq.

21:58.425 --> 22:00.793
Even though we kept making promises

22:00.794 --> 22:02.428
to the locals who worked for us.

22:02.429 --> 22:04.029
And they kept getting killed.

22:04.030 --> 22:05.731
The next time I have
to tell Russell Jackson

22:05.732 --> 22:09.368
that I went against POTUS's
wishes, someone please...

22:09.369 --> 22:12.336
- Shoot you?
- (chuckles)

22:14.139 --> 22:17.509
Any idea if the president is
inclined to take their offer?

22:17.510 --> 22:19.444
I doubt it.

22:19.445 --> 22:22.648
- I'm a flawed messenger.
- Well, they all had

22:22.649 --> 22:27.019
the same commanding officer who
vouched for them on their visas.

22:27.020 --> 22:30.254
Lieutenant Colonel Mike Wilkerson.

22:43.969 --> 22:45.771
Colonel Wilkerson?

22:45.772 --> 22:47.439
- Secretary.
- Hey.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.774
Thank you for letting me stop by

22:49.775 --> 22:52.209
- on such short notice.
- Absolutely, ma'am. Come on up.

22:53.178 --> 22:55.380
- Who's this?
- This is Kulcha.

22:55.381 --> 22:58.415
- Say hello, Kulcha.
- Hey, darling.

22:59.351 --> 23:02.721
I mean, I'm-I'm shocked.

23:02.722 --> 23:05.190
That doesn't sound like them at all.

23:05.191 --> 23:06.524
Certainly not

23:06.525 --> 23:09.627
like the guys you wrote such
glowing recommendations for.

23:09.628 --> 23:11.963
Yeah. To no avail, unfortunately.

23:11.964 --> 23:14.466
Do you think that they'd kill Garrity

23:14.467 --> 23:16.366
if their demands aren't met?

23:17.535 --> 23:19.304
I-I don't know, ma'am.

23:19.305 --> 23:21.739
But in the three years
these guys worked for me,

23:21.740 --> 23:24.943
they exemplified courage
and professionalism,

23:24.944 --> 23:26.644
despite the danger.

23:26.645 --> 23:29.247
They believed they were
securing a better future

23:29.248 --> 23:30.748
for their country, which turned out

23:30.749 --> 23:33.383
to be more complicated than
any of us ever imagined.

23:35.053 --> 23:37.755
But if-if they're doing this,

23:37.756 --> 23:41.558
then I believe it's because they
didn't have any other options.

23:42.427 --> 23:44.629
This guy's the only uncomplicated thing

23:44.630 --> 23:46.898
that came out of my tour.

23:46.899 --> 23:49.767
I found him, barely alive, on a street

23:49.768 --> 23:52.035
in Kandahar.

23:52.670 --> 23:54.372
STERLING: <i>Mr. President,</i>

23:54.373 --> 23:55.973
your Secretary of State has gone rogue.

23:55.974 --> 23:58.509
I could not have been clearer
when I gave her your directive.

23:58.510 --> 24:01.145
Your directive was we don't
negotiate with terrorists.

24:01.146 --> 24:03.814
But that was when we thought
the kidnappers were Taliban.

24:03.815 --> 24:05.416
These guys may not have
been terrorists before,

24:05.417 --> 24:07.451
- but they sure act like it now.
- I believe they were pushed

24:07.452 --> 24:11.088
to make a terrible choice based
on desperate circumstances.

24:11.089 --> 24:12.523
So now you want to forgive them.

24:12.524 --> 24:14.792
As CIA director, you
went above and beyond

24:14.793 --> 24:17.661
- to protect our assets in other countries,
- I'm guessing...

24:17.662 --> 24:19.830
- because that was the promise we made.
- none of your former CIA assets

24:19.831 --> 24:22.366
- ever kidnapped an American foreign
service officer. - That was the deal.

24:22.367 --> 24:24.435
These men put their lives on the line,

24:24.436 --> 24:27.338
and they've been waiting for years.

24:27.339 --> 24:29.907
I spoke with their former C.O.
He still vouches for them.

24:29.908 --> 24:31.108
Sir...

24:31.109 --> 24:33.911
When he took in a stray dog in Kandahar,

24:33.912 --> 24:36.847
all he had to do was sign a few
forms, and it was a naturalized

24:36.848 --> 24:40.818
American overnight.
Is that dog less expendable?

24:40.819 --> 24:42.953
I mean, somehow that
system wasn't bogged down.

24:42.954 --> 24:45.189
Or maybe we never intended
to keep that promise.

24:45.190 --> 24:48.725
Mr. President, the safest,
cleanest way to save Tom Garrity

24:48.726 --> 24:49.893
is to take the deal.

24:49.894 --> 24:51.128
The kidnappers will go to prison.

24:51.129 --> 24:54.164
That doesn't betray our policy.

24:54.165 --> 24:56.867
- Make it so.
- Mr. President,

24:56.868 --> 24:59.226
- I strongly disagree with..
- I know you do, Craig.

24:59.470 --> 25:02.206
Now, will you give
Elizabeth and me a moment?

25:02.207 --> 25:04.507
Thank you, Mr. President.

25:06.810 --> 25:08.145
Thank you, sir.

25:08.146 --> 25:09.780
Don't.

25:09.781 --> 25:12.449
Russell's argument won the day, not yours.

25:12.450 --> 25:15.419
Works for me.

25:15.420 --> 25:17.788
Harrison told me about the heroin

25:17.789 --> 25:19.322
that Stevie found on him

25:19.323 --> 25:22.124
and that Henry leaned on him.

25:23.827 --> 25:29.131
We thought that you and
Lydia would want to know.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.535
I'm just sorry Stevie
had to get involved.

25:32.536 --> 25:34.671
No. They're close.

25:34.672 --> 25:36.706
They always have been.

25:36.707 --> 25:38.942
Now that he's 21, we can't
just send him to his room

25:38.943 --> 25:41.378
every time he makes a bad choice.

25:41.379 --> 25:44.848
We have to hope that we raised
him well enough that...

25:44.849 --> 25:47.950
eventually he'll make the right one.

25:50.353 --> 25:51.454
Thanks, Elizabeth.

25:51.455 --> 25:52.689
FARMIGLIA: <i>Upon hearing
Russian President</i>

25:52.690 --> 25:54.824
Ostrov is dead, the Pentagon
believes we should use

25:54.825 --> 25:57.594
the potential instability to
take a more aggressive posture.

25:57.595 --> 25:59.429
So your idea is to take this
fragile, paranoid country

25:59.430 --> 26:01.197
that constantly thinks the
United States is going

26:01.198 --> 26:03.533
to attack them and, at their
moment of maximum vulnerability,

26:03.534 --> 26:06.102
validate that paranoia? That
sounds like it'll work great.

26:06.103 --> 26:07.589
Are you saying their
moment of weakness isn't

26:07.590 --> 26:09.411
an opportunity to take strategic gain?

26:09.412 --> 26:11.240
The problem is we don't
know what it'll be,

26:11.241 --> 26:12.477
beyond incredibly destabilizing

26:12.478 --> 26:13.443
and dangerous for the whole world.

26:13.444 --> 26:15.778
Our primary concern
should be Intel gathering,

26:15.779 --> 26:18.047
trying to figure out who will
emerge as the next leader.

26:18.048 --> 26:19.882
Okay, so who does State like?

26:19.883 --> 26:21.784
As of right now, the
best we can hope for

26:21.785 --> 26:24.687
is Foreign Minister Gorev. He appears
to be the least hostile to the West.

26:24.688 --> 26:27.223
- I'm assuming Defense doesn't agree.
- Sir, we like

26:27.224 --> 26:29.392
General Doroshevich.
He's moderate, pragmatic.

26:29.393 --> 26:31.527
Last month, he joked
about nuking Grozny.

26:31.528 --> 26:33.616
The Joint Chiefs have been courting
him over the last several years

26:33.617 --> 26:35.167
at the Russian-NATO
Partnership Conference.

26:35.168 --> 26:37.713
Just because he had caviar on
toast points with our top brass

26:37.714 --> 26:39.448
doesn't make the guy
a friend to the West.

26:39.449 --> 26:40.850
All right, all right. Enough.

26:40.851 --> 26:43.685
You both need to get serious
about finding common ground.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.257
20 minutes ago, the president and I

26:48.258 --> 26:50.526
had a top secret briefing with the DNI.

26:50.527 --> 26:53.229
We have it on good authority that Ostrov

26:53.230 --> 26:55.131
is in Central Clinic Hospital.

26:55.132 --> 26:57.432
Condition unknown.

27:00.102 --> 27:02.705
Consider yourselves read in.

27:02.706 --> 27:05.074
This isn't a drill anymore.

27:05.075 --> 27:07.375
Get on the same page.

27:09.078 --> 27:12.247
Now.

27:12.248 --> 27:15.217
Stevie skipped school, and
she's not returning my calls

27:15.218 --> 27:18.721
- or my texts, so...
- Well...

27:18.722 --> 27:21.690
Are we more worried
about her than Ostrov?

27:21.691 --> 27:24.526
I just think maybe we hit her
a little too hard this morning.

27:24.527 --> 27:25.961
She needs space.

27:25.962 --> 27:28.831
At least Harrison came
clean with his parents.

27:28.832 --> 27:30.832
I'm not surprised.
I've been on the receiving end

27:30.833 --> 27:35.036
of your persuasion...
resistance is futile.

27:37.673 --> 27:40.841
What? Are you okay? I strike a nerve?

27:41.576 --> 27:44.780
Uh, no. Just a work thing.

27:44.781 --> 27:46.981
You want to talk about it?

27:48.216 --> 27:50.819
Ah. That work.

27:50.820 --> 27:52.954
Sorry to interrupt. Uh, the
families have been secured

27:52.955 --> 27:55.357
and are being taken to Bagram Airfield.

27:55.358 --> 27:57.858
And you're needed in the Sit Room.

27:59.060 --> 28:01.930
Thank you.

28:01.931 --> 28:03.965
We definitely need to plan a vacation.

28:03.966 --> 28:07.235
I mean it. Something...
without the kids.

28:07.236 --> 28:10.338
No cell service, Internet,

28:10.339 --> 28:13.408
- no people, except maybe a masseuse.
- Go.

28:13.409 --> 28:16.711
- And a chef.
- Go.

28:16.712 --> 28:18.979
(sighs)

28:20.515 --> 28:22.884
HILL: <i>HUMINT helped uncover
the location of Garrity</i>

28:22.885 --> 28:26.221
and the kidnappers. They're
in an abandoned cement plant

28:26.222 --> 28:28.289
32 miles outside Kabul.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.458
What's the source of that intelligence?

28:30.459 --> 28:31.559
Russian GRU.

28:31.560 --> 28:34.629
DIA confirmed its authenticity.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.831
Mr. President, I have
a SEAL team en route.

28:36.832 --> 28:38.299
- What's our posture?
- We stick to the plan.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.135
Observe from a distance, and,
when the families reach Andrews,

28:41.136 --> 28:42.704
we pick up Garrity and his captors.

28:42.705 --> 28:44.806
Gorev told me he might
have some Intel for us.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.708
Pretty amazing he came through.

28:46.709 --> 28:48.376
If Ostrov's dead,

28:48.377 --> 28:50.878
could be an auspicious beginning
to our new relationship.

28:50.879 --> 28:55.550
If Gorev emerges from the power
vacuum with the big job.

28:55.551 --> 28:57.585
Mr. President, a heavily
armed Taliban unit

28:57.586 --> 28:59.800
is moving toward Garrity and
the kidnappers in a hurry.

28:59.801 --> 29:00.755
ELIZABETH: They're made.

29:00.756 --> 29:02.404
- Damn it.
- How far out are they, Admiral?

29:02.405 --> 29:03.338
Uh, about two hours.

29:03.339 --> 29:04.673
How fast can the SEALs get there?

29:04.674 --> 29:06.375
Also two hours, sir.

29:06.376 --> 29:09.176
I hope the good guys get there first.

29:17.610 --> 29:19.986
SEAL team is aware of
the Taliban incursion,

29:19.987 --> 29:21.845
Mr. President, and are
balls to the wall.

29:21.846 --> 29:22.979
95 minutes to the target.

29:22.980 --> 29:24.647
And the Taliban unit, are we gonna

29:24.648 --> 29:25.848
- beat them there?
- Too close to call.

29:25.849 --> 29:27.116
We have to warn them.

29:27.117 --> 29:28.851
- We have to tell them to move.
- Tell them we know

29:28.852 --> 29:30.119
where they are,
they'll think it's a ploy.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.487
Not to mention, it'll blow

29:31.488 --> 29:32.889
- the element of surprise.
- Which won't matter

29:32.890 --> 29:34.991
if the Taliban get there first.

29:34.992 --> 29:36.125
DALTON: I'd agree with you, Bess,

29:36.126 --> 29:37.660
but we promised them that their families

29:37.661 --> 29:39.729
would be safe in the U.S.
before they surrender.

29:39.730 --> 29:41.030
I don't see how they're
going to trust us

29:41.031 --> 29:42.698
if we change the rules of the game now.

29:42.699 --> 29:44.500
- They won't.
- I agree.

29:44.501 --> 29:46.102
We haven't exactly built up

29:46.103 --> 29:48.137
a reserve of trust with these guys.

29:48.138 --> 29:49.138
But...

29:49.139 --> 29:51.874
I might know a guy who has.

29:51.875 --> 29:54.175
(line ringing)

29:57.213 --> 29:59.348
- Hello?
- Ishaq.

29:59.349 --> 30:01.283
It's Mike Wilkerson.

30:01.284 --> 30:03.052
- It's been a while, huh?
- Oh, my God.

30:03.053 --> 30:05.187
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine.

30:05.188 --> 30:08.123
Your family and Falal's and-and
Jawdah's are all on a plane

30:08.124 --> 30:09.758
- to Maryland. They're safe.
- Then why this?

30:09.759 --> 30:11.427
- Why are you calling?
- I'm here with the president

30:11.428 --> 30:13.195
and the Secretary of State.

30:13.196 --> 30:15.764
They've promised that the United
States is gonna honor its deal

30:15.765 --> 30:17.800
with you, but something
unexpected has come up.

30:17.801 --> 30:19.501
What? What unexpected?

30:19.502 --> 30:21.883
The Taliban are coming for you.
They'll be there

30:21.884 --> 30:23.617
in less than 15 minutes.

30:23.618 --> 30:24.684
You know where we are?

30:24.685 --> 30:25.785
Yes. In Gul Bagh.

30:25.786 --> 30:27.087
- At the old cement plant.
- My God.

30:27.088 --> 30:28.688
(Ishaq speaking Dari)

30:28.689 --> 30:30.357
Ishaq, listen to me.

30:30.358 --> 30:32.259
Listen to me. Stay with me.

30:32.260 --> 30:33.360
The good news is there's

30:33.361 --> 30:34.861
an American unit heading to pick you up.

30:34.862 --> 30:36.763
No. Not before our families

30:36.764 --> 30:38.531
- are in the United States.
- Not enough time.

30:38.532 --> 30:41.568
Now, the president and secretary
have given me their word

30:41.569 --> 30:43.203
your families will be taken care of.

30:43.204 --> 30:45.805
Mike, please.

30:45.806 --> 30:47.440
You know my children.

30:47.441 --> 30:48.475
We're gonna get you out of there.

30:48.476 --> 30:49.976
But you need to move to a safe location

30:49.977 --> 30:52.117
- where we can pick you up.
- (speaking Dari)

30:57.083 --> 30:59.194
We're running out of time.
Just give him the landing zone.

30:59.195 --> 31:01.487
Ishaq, there's a closed gas
station two and a quarter miles

31:01.488 --> 31:04.424
northeast of you.
Go there now and wait...

31:04.425 --> 31:05.458
What the hell?

31:05.459 --> 31:06.492
Sat phone lost connection.

31:06.493 --> 31:08.261
Can you get it back?

31:08.262 --> 31:09.562
Uh, negative.

31:09.563 --> 31:11.497
There's interference across the area.

31:11.498 --> 31:13.499
12 minutes until the
Taliban reaches them.

31:13.500 --> 31:17.269
Did they even get the landing zone?

31:19.038 --> 31:20.506
Mr. President,

31:20.507 --> 31:22.908
we just got word on Ostrov.

31:23.843 --> 31:25.578
Okay, what if I...

31:25.579 --> 31:28.080
what if I give you the Ninth
Fleet in the Northern Pacific?

31:28.081 --> 31:29.782
- But no missiles in Poland.
- The president

31:29.783 --> 31:31.984
- isn't interested in half measures.
- Of course he is.

31:31.985 --> 31:33.319
That's the definition of "diplomacy."

31:33.320 --> 31:35.221
Sounds more like the
definition of "weakness."

31:35.222 --> 31:37.156
Look, I'm all for projecting strength,

31:37.157 --> 31:39.425
but what we need to tell
the president is complicated

31:39.426 --> 31:41.861
and nuanced and somewhat contradictory.

31:41.862 --> 31:43.496
Not what I'm gonna tell him.

31:43.497 --> 31:45.998
You can stand down,
gentlemen. President Ostrov

31:45.999 --> 31:49.201
just showed up at a parade
in Saint Petersburg.

31:49.202 --> 31:51.237
Oh, thank God.

31:51.238 --> 31:53.906
Guess this report isn't
so urgent anymore.

31:53.907 --> 31:56.774
Though your progress is impressive.

32:00.079 --> 32:02.815
Rain check?

32:02.816 --> 32:05.284
Guy's got to die sometime.

32:05.285 --> 32:07.585
Right?

32:14.460 --> 32:16.762
30 seconds to landing zone. Over.

32:16.763 --> 32:18.664
Copy that, Commander.
Can you see the package?

32:18.665 --> 32:19.898
Negative.

32:19.899 --> 32:22.200
Descending.

32:24.002 --> 32:28.307
Oh, wait a second.
I have four men at the LZ.

32:28.308 --> 32:30.409
Can you visually confirm
the package? Over.

32:30.410 --> 32:32.576
Hold.

32:34.313 --> 32:36.949
Yes. We have visual
confirmation on the package.

32:36.950 --> 32:38.450
- We're going down.
- Thank God, it's them.

32:38.451 --> 32:40.919
- They moved.
- Good call, Bess.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.820
(automatic gunfire)

32:46.692 --> 32:48.660
- Status, Commander? Over.
- We're taking fire, ma'am.

32:48.661 --> 32:50.261
From who?

32:52.230 --> 32:53.198
Commander?

32:53.199 --> 32:55.534
Taliban. Column with heavy artillery.

32:55.535 --> 32:57.235
Taliban must have been tipped

32:57.236 --> 32:58.270
by locals.

32:58.271 --> 32:59.838
(audio breaking up)

32:59.839 --> 33:01.473
Engaging.

33:01.474 --> 33:03.807
(automatic gunfire)

33:04.576 --> 33:06.845
Package on the move. Follow him, Pete.

33:06.846 --> 33:10.381
(gunfire continues)

33:13.051 --> 33:16.520
- That's Garrity.
- (indistinct shouting)

33:17.088 --> 33:18.956
Status, Commander?

33:19.691 --> 33:21.525
Commander?

33:24.295 --> 33:27.332
We have Garrity, Admiral.
Permission to evacuate? Over.

33:27.333 --> 33:30.000
- (heavy gunfire)
- Mr. President?

33:31.870 --> 33:34.772
Mr. President?

33:34.773 --> 33:37.175
(heavy gunfire continues)

33:37.176 --> 33:38.743
We cannot leave them.

33:38.744 --> 33:40.244
We gave them our word.

33:40.245 --> 33:43.314
We got our guy... we absolutely
can and should evacuate now.

33:43.315 --> 33:45.450
The Taliban is still our enemy.

33:45.451 --> 33:49.387
We have a Black Hawk
with two M-134 miniguns

33:49.388 --> 33:51.289
and 30 SEALs armed to the teeth

33:51.290 --> 33:53.024
with M4 carbines!

33:53.025 --> 33:55.193
That is more than enough
firepower to wipe them out.

33:55.194 --> 33:56.294
We're taking heavy fire!

33:56.295 --> 33:57.929
Waiting for orders. Over.

33:57.930 --> 33:59.263
(heavy gunfire continues)

33:59.264 --> 34:01.924
CRAIG: Mr. President.

34:02.433 --> 34:04.068
Evacuate.

34:04.069 --> 34:07.371
- DALTON: Get them out of there.
- Evacuate. Permission to evacuate granted.

34:07.372 --> 34:08.806
Copy that, Admiral. Out.

34:08.806 --> 34:11.542
I can't justify spilling our
troops' blood to save them.

34:11.543 --> 34:13.842
(heavy gunfire continues)

34:21.952 --> 34:24.721
(gunfire stops)

34:45.594 --> 34:48.964
I'm sorry things didn't
go your way back there.

34:48.965 --> 34:51.867
Is that how you see it?

34:51.868 --> 34:54.670
Sometimes things go your
way with the president,

34:54.670 --> 34:56.338
sometimes they don't?

34:56.339 --> 34:58.040
I guess it is.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.075
- Whew!
- But we advise, all right?

35:00.076 --> 35:02.011
The president makes his decision.

35:02.012 --> 35:04.446
Which absolves you
of any responsibility.

35:04.447 --> 35:06.548
No, I take full responsibility

35:06.549 --> 35:09.718
- for everything I do in my job.
- Including those men's deaths?

35:09.719 --> 35:11.286
Because Dalton relies on his advisors,

35:11.287 --> 35:14.022
and I think he could have
been persuaded to save them.

35:14.023 --> 35:16.492
I shared with the president
exactly what I believed.

35:16.493 --> 35:18.994
(laughs): Really? Because...

35:18.995 --> 35:21.630
based on your history, I
thought you would have argued

35:21.631 --> 35:24.433
to take out a Taliban unit
while we had the chance.

35:24.434 --> 35:26.134
You made your bones at the Pentagon

35:26.135 --> 35:28.303
- supporting military intervention.
- You think I was

35:28.304 --> 35:30.205
more interested in scoring
a blow against you

35:30.206 --> 35:31.840
than giving the president
honest counsel?

35:31.841 --> 35:35.043
I'm saying it goes against
everything you've advocated

35:35.044 --> 35:37.311
for the last 15 years.

35:38.213 --> 35:40.282
Just... sharing

35:40.283 --> 35:43.083
with you exactly what I believe.

35:49.424 --> 35:50.625
HENRY: Hey.

35:50.626 --> 35:51.927
No texting at dinner.

35:51.928 --> 35:54.996
Fine, but I just read that
the urge to check your texts

35:54.997 --> 35:57.332
is actually more powerful than
a drug addict's urge to use.

35:57.333 --> 35:59.534
- Then turn it off.
- Was it Stevie?

35:59.535 --> 36:00.502
No.

36:00.503 --> 36:02.504
Have you heard from your sister?

36:02.505 --> 36:04.306
- Me?
- Mm.

36:04.307 --> 36:05.573
(door opens)

36:05.574 --> 36:07.642
Hi.

36:07.643 --> 36:09.577
- Sorry I'm late.
- Where have you been?

36:09.578 --> 36:10.779
Living my life.

36:10.780 --> 36:13.548
ELIZABETH: Would it kill
you to return a text,

36:13.549 --> 36:15.150
- maybe call? Yes.
- Or a phone call.

36:15.151 --> 36:16.885
HENRY: Right now is not the time to...

36:16.886 --> 36:19.120
Can we skip the interrogation

36:19.121 --> 36:21.888
and just... eat?

36:33.101 --> 36:35.637
Okay, it's obvious we're in need
of some peer mediation here.

36:35.638 --> 36:38.306
- I happen to have my talking stick...
- And here we go.

36:38.307 --> 36:40.842
Speak openly and honestly

36:40.843 --> 36:42.944
using a lot of "I" statements.

36:42.945 --> 36:45.378
Mom, you can go first.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.418
I had a very difficult day at work,

36:50.419 --> 36:53.954
and I am doing my best not
to take it out on anyone.

36:54.989 --> 36:56.657
But I guess what I'm feeling

36:56.658 --> 36:59.860
mostly right now is... (sighs)

36:59.861 --> 37:03.764
...how vexing and difficult it is

37:03.765 --> 37:06.100
to be the parent of an adult.

37:06.101 --> 37:09.804
I have no control over
your life anymore, Stevie.

37:09.805 --> 37:13.273
And that scares the hell out of me.

37:13.941 --> 37:15.342
Oh, God.

37:15.343 --> 37:17.078
That was really good, Mom.

37:17.079 --> 37:19.012
Thank you, Noodle.

37:21.348 --> 37:23.650
Your turn, slugger.

37:25.786 --> 37:28.956
Okay, Stevie, I think you owe it
to Mom and me to explain

37:28.957 --> 37:30.424
what you were doing all day

37:30.425 --> 37:32.059
if you weren't in your
classes that we pay for.

37:32.060 --> 37:33.560
Okay, you're spying on me?

37:33.561 --> 37:35.362
- No. I want you to call me back.
- Did you call my teachers and ask...?

37:35.363 --> 37:36.497
I texted and called you a number of times.

37:36.498 --> 37:38.132
Everyone needs to respect the stick.

37:38.133 --> 37:40.868
- And you wouldn't return my calls.
- Give me that! I took the LSAT.

37:40.869 --> 37:42.536
Okay? That's where I was...

37:42.537 --> 37:44.138
taking the LSAT.

37:44.139 --> 37:46.159
Isn't that the SAT for law school?

37:47.341 --> 37:50.010
That talk this morning
really freaked me out.

37:50.011 --> 37:51.745
I mean, you guys are right.

37:51.746 --> 37:54.515
For the past year, I have
been a total screwup.

37:54.516 --> 37:56.016
Dropping out of college,

37:56.017 --> 37:58.619
dating a recovering
addict when I knew that

37:58.620 --> 38:00.220
it was bad for him,

38:00.221 --> 38:02.022
- hiding his stash.
- Wait, you did what?

38:02.023 --> 38:03.257
- Shh.
- I didn't like

38:03.258 --> 38:04.591
who I was becoming,

38:04.592 --> 38:06.927
and I started to question
whether I was even

38:06.928 --> 38:09.162
a decent person.

38:09.163 --> 38:10.597
So I decided

38:10.598 --> 38:13.900
to sign up to do something
that I knew I could do well.

38:13.901 --> 38:15.902
A standardized test.

38:15.903 --> 38:19.406
And maybe someday I can
do some good as a lawyer.

38:19.407 --> 38:20.640
You were having

38:20.641 --> 38:23.976
an identity crisis, so you took the LSAT.

38:24.878 --> 38:27.547
- You are such a McCord.
- ELIZABETH: Oh, honey,

38:27.548 --> 38:29.983
- I love you so much.
- (chuckles): Oh, baby.

38:29.984 --> 38:31.218
- Ah...
- I love you, too.

38:31.219 --> 38:33.752
Who thinks peer mediating's a joke now?

38:36.790 --> 38:38.792
Did we push her too hard?

38:38.793 --> 38:41.494
We pushed her just
hard enough, apparently.

38:41.495 --> 38:42.629
Well, law school...

38:42.630 --> 38:46.633
To take stock in her life;
not a bad exercise.

38:46.634 --> 38:48.967
So we're not horrible parents?

38:50.236 --> 38:52.772
Not today.

38:52.773 --> 38:55.073
(phone rings)

38:55.808 --> 38:58.511
Hello?

38:58.512 --> 39:00.312
Who?

39:01.014 --> 39:03.616
Okay, send him in.

39:03.617 --> 39:05.717
It's Anton Gorev.

39:09.889 --> 39:13.925
The Russian foreign
minister's dropping by?

39:14.761 --> 39:17.330
Do you have any idea what this is about?

39:17.331 --> 39:19.297
No.

39:20.266 --> 39:21.901
Do you?

39:21.902 --> 39:23.703
I hope not.

39:23.704 --> 39:26.638
I-I don't like the sound of that.

39:27.507 --> 39:29.408
Anton. Come in.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.744
- Good evening, Elizabeth.
- You know Henry.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.779
- Of course. Professor McCord.
- Hi, Anton.

39:33.780 --> 39:35.314
GOREV: I understand you were

39:35.315 --> 39:36.916
able to save your
foreign service officer.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.851
Yes. Yes. And thank you.

39:38.852 --> 39:41.253
Your help was very much appreciated.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.655
- Come on in, please.
- Oh. Thank you.

39:45.524 --> 39:48.661
I guess I-I just didn't think
that you would be coming

39:48.662 --> 39:51.996
to ask for something
in return so quickly.

39:53.065 --> 39:55.334
It's about my daughter, Olga.

39:55.335 --> 39:57.102
As you know, she recently started

39:57.103 --> 39:58.604
at Harvard Business School.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.829
Thanks in part to your
gentle grading, Professor.

40:00.830 --> 40:01.540
(chuckles)

40:01.541 --> 40:04.076
What-what is it with Olga?

40:04.077 --> 40:07.246
If anything were to happen to me...

40:07.247 --> 40:12.550
I humbly ask that Olga's visa
to the United States be renewed.

40:13.252 --> 40:15.320
What are you worried about?

40:15.321 --> 40:16.655
(chuckles softly)

40:16.656 --> 40:18.057
Please, the-the visa

40:18.058 --> 40:19.425
is the practical part.

40:19.426 --> 40:22.094
I'm... also hoping the two of you

40:22.095 --> 40:24.629
can keep a friendly eye on her.

40:26.899 --> 40:29.001
- Of course.
- Sure.

40:29.002 --> 40:31.302
Thank you. I should go.

40:33.505 --> 40:36.008
Anton, what's going on?

40:36.009 --> 40:38.043
Are you sick?

40:38.044 --> 40:40.312
No. I am well.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.179
Then what is this about?

40:43.915 --> 40:46.151
In one hour, the Kremlin will announce

40:46.152 --> 40:48.553
that President Ostrov is dead.

40:48.554 --> 40:50.821
Wow.

40:52.290 --> 40:55.360
Are you making a play for power?

40:55.361 --> 40:56.828
Because...

40:56.829 --> 40:59.496
between us, you're who I'm hoping for.

41:00.398 --> 41:02.601
I must go back to Moscow.

41:02.602 --> 41:04.703
I have your word on Olga?

41:04.704 --> 41:07.471
- Yes.
- Sure.

41:13.578 --> 41:14.846
Good night.

41:14.847 --> 41:16.914
Thank you.

41:19.017 --> 41:23.154
(whispering): Do you think that he could
have had something to do with it?

41:23.155 --> 41:27.095
Being out of the country when it
happened makes for pretty good cover.

41:27.992 --> 41:30.227
I better call my boss.

41:34.632 --> 41:37.167
What do you want now?

41:43.207 --> 41:45.642
Ostrov is dead.

41:52.250 --> 41:54.518
Why should I believe you?

42:00.224 --> 42:03.393
Russia has been through worse.

42:05.563 --> 42:07.465
Take the deal, Dmitri.

42:07.466 --> 42:09.366
Work with me.

42:10.801 --> 42:12.970
I already told you...

42:12.971 --> 42:15.206
I am not a traitor.

42:15.207 --> 42:16.540
I love my country.

42:16.541 --> 42:18.976
Your country is about
to go off the rails.

42:18.977 --> 42:20.478
- No, you don't know this.
- I know

42:20.479 --> 42:22.246
for a fact that top-level
Russian government officials

42:22.247 --> 42:24.907
are securing their families
in foreign cities.

42:25.149 --> 42:26.584
If the power brokers are worried

42:26.585 --> 42:30.653
about <i> their</i> loved ones, what
hope is there for your sister?

42:40.397 --> 42:42.032
You swear she will get these drugs?

42:42.033 --> 42:44.693
She could be on a plane
to Stockholm tomorrow.

42:57.848 --> 43:01.418
I am entrusting you with
my sister's life, Professor.

43:01.419 --> 43:03.386
And my life.

43:11.862 --> 43:14.163
Then we have an agreement?

43:14.898 --> 43:17.139
Yes.

43:18.156 --> 43:25.519
