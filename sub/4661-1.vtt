00:23.606 --> 00:28.600
I don't know, feels like a grave.

00:29.751 --> 00:32.744
Their queen is here.

00:33.205 --> 00:36.587
And we have our orders.

00:58.665 --> 01:01.085
It's a trap.

01:34.646 --> 01:38.333
This is what is known.

01:39.485 --> 01:42.710
There has always been man.

01:45.322 --> 01:49.162
And there have always been vampires.

01:58.186 --> 02:02.910
Since the beginning, the two
have been locked in conflict.

02:02.943 --> 02:06.902
The vampire's were quicker, stronger.

02:07.901 --> 02:11.243
But man had the sun.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.722
It was not enough.

02:36.126 --> 02:40.137
And so it went like this
over many years.

02:40.172 --> 02:44.150
The two races destroying
not only each other ...

02:44.189 --> 02:46.378
but the world itself.

02:48.492 --> 02:52.366
Facing extinction, mankind
withdrew behind walled cities

02:52.367 --> 02:55.671
under the protection of the Church.

02:57.206 --> 03:02.124
And then the ultimate weapon
was found, the priests.

03:08.728 --> 03:15.371
Warriors with extraordinary powers, trained
by the Church in the art of vampire combat.

03:15.404 --> 03:20.095
They alone turned the tide to man.

03:20.862 --> 03:24.471
The remaining vampires
were placed on reservations.

03:24.511 --> 03:27.741
And fearing the power of the
weapon they created ...

03:27.774 --> 03:31.965
the ruling clergy ordered
the priests disbanded.

03:31.998 --> 03:38.143
The former warriors to be integrated
back into a society that no longer needed them.

03:40.216 --> 03:44.173
And as the years passed,
the few surviving priests

03:44.206 --> 03:48.092
faded into obscurity...

03:48.126 --> 03:51.353
...like the vampire menace before them.

04:16.810 --> 04:20.153
Residual radiation is still spotty,

04:20.190 --> 04:24.189
but the soil contamination
is close to zero.

04:24.223 --> 04:28.062
With a little luck, we can
finally start planting.

04:28.095 --> 04:30.750
I'm proud of you, Owen.

04:33.130 --> 04:36.281
Great, stew again.

04:37.357 --> 04:40.735
- Atoning for your sins?
- No, why?

04:41.196 --> 04:45.036
Wearing the nicest dress, where else
would you have been all day, but church?

04:45.069 --> 04:47.881
I was in town.

04:47.915 --> 04:51.068
I figure someone here needs
a life outside this outpost.

04:51.103 --> 04:54.026
I thought I said I didn't want you to
spending so much time out there.

04:54.059 --> 04:59.935
- I'm old enough to go where I want.
- You're 18. That's not old enough, not out here.

05:00.205 --> 05:04.428
I know it's hard, but we all
have to make sacrifices.

05:04.461 --> 05:06.314
Sacrifices?!

05:06.347 --> 05:08.353
You mean living out
here like a prisoner?!

05:08.357 --> 05:10.653
- Lucy?
- No friends, no fun?!

05:10.686 --> 05:13.529
Just that someday you might be able to grow
something in these godforsaken lands?

05:13.566 --> 05:16.218
Enough!

05:20.055 --> 05:23.359
Bow your heads and say grace.

05:31.809 --> 05:35.916
Dear Lord, we thank you for
what we are about to receive...

05:38.336 --> 05:41.292
- Daddy?
- Shush!

05:47.321 --> 05:49.085
- Owen?
- Tear down below!

05:49.121 --> 05:51.085
What's going on?!

05:58.765 --> 06:00.761
Hurry child!

06:02.683 --> 06:04.601
Hurry!

06:09.793 --> 06:14.585
- Mama.
- Whatever you hear... don't scream.

06:19.093 --> 06:21.585
Oh, my god!

06:21.806 --> 06:23.801
Get behind me!

06:27.565 --> 06:30.061
Shannon!

07:28.046 --> 07:33.152
God protects you, the
Church protects you.

07:33.187 --> 07:37.228
The city protects you.

07:37.261 --> 07:41.984
Absolution is the only way.

07:51.201 --> 07:55.579
Absolution is the only way.

08:03.758 --> 08:09.710
Remember, to against the Church,
means to go against God.

08:14.012 --> 08:18.349
Confession room 5 is free.

08:22.575 --> 08:24.993
Move forward.

08:25.837 --> 08:30.447
Initiate confessional sequence.

08:32.174 --> 08:35.438
Please speak at the tone.

08:35.471 --> 08:38.895
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.

08:46.383 --> 08:50.106
- Yes, my son?
- I had the dream again

08:50.875 --> 08:54.292
- about the war.
- Tell me more.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.712
We were in the hives, like always.

08:58.787 --> 09:04.161
Each fell, and I wasn't strong enough.

09:04.546 --> 09:07.617
Tell me more.

09:10.575 --> 09:15.299
I have questions, doubts.

09:15.565 --> 09:18.221
The Devil comes in many shapes.

09:18.255 --> 09:21.826
The best way to combat him,
is through personnel sacrifice...

09:21.859 --> 09:24.898
and a long day's labor.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.553
Yes, Father.

09:27.587 --> 09:31.468
Now say three Hail Mary's
and four Our Father's.

09:31.502 --> 09:37.072
And remember, to go against the
Church, is to go against God.

09:43.407 --> 09:47.132
- Don't point.
- Mom, what's on that man's face?

09:47.169 --> 09:50.241
It's a tattoo.

09:52.738 --> 09:55.502
Did it hurt?

09:57.692 --> 10:02.224
- Why can't I talk to him?
- You don't talk to priests.

10:15.015 --> 10:19.049
- Who are you?
- Name's Hicks, on the Sheriff from Augustine.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.975
- What do you want?
- There was a vamp attack.

10:22.008 --> 10:26.619
They took Lucy. Your brother is hurt bad.
He told me where to find you.

10:26.652 --> 10:29.984
- And Shannon?
- No.

10:49.864 --> 10:55.243
Lucy talked about you.
Said you were a hero during the war.

10:55.277 --> 10:59.278
Said that when it came to
killing vampires, you were the best.

11:00.123 --> 11:04.658
I'm going after her,
I'm gonna get her back.

11:05.041 --> 11:09.345
Just thought I should let you know
in case you wanted to come along.

11:09.653 --> 11:13.111
Figure I could use someone
like you by my side.

11:18.297 --> 11:21.101
Okay.

11:38.277 --> 11:42.618
Thank you for meeting me in
such short notice, Monsignors.

11:42.651 --> 11:46.538
Monsignor Chamberlain
has informed us of the situation.

11:46.571 --> 11:49.689
- Your family is in our prayers.
- Thank you.

11:49.726 --> 11:54.030
I come before you because I need
my authority reinstated.

11:54.064 --> 11:56.836
On what grounds?

11:58.372 --> 12:02.676
- This was a vampire attack.
- Vampires?

12:04.904 --> 12:09.015
Nonsense, we've had no reports of
any escapes from the reservations.

12:09.048 --> 12:12.055
This is obviously the
work of wasteland bandits.

12:12.088 --> 12:16.474
- Monsignor, the boy was clear.
- "The boy" was mistaken.

12:16.507 --> 12:22.578
There is no vampire menace, the wastelands
are heavens for the lawless and the immoral...

12:22.612 --> 12:26.497
To send a priest out there after
such a lot would be both ridiculous and futile.

12:26.531 --> 12:30.415
This is best left to
the local authority.

12:31.568 --> 12:36.564
Monsignor Orelas, this man
has been of great service to the Church.

12:36.603 --> 12:39.719
If it weren't for the priest
we would have been overrun by the...

12:39.753 --> 12:42.941
We are well aware of his
accomplishments, Monsignor Chamberlain.

12:42.974 --> 12:46.553
Thank you, you may sit.

12:47.246 --> 12:50.011
I am begging you.

12:50.396 --> 12:55.314
- Allow me to find her.
- You must understand something priest.

12:55.347 --> 12:59.617
The sanctity of these walls is absolute.

12:59.656 --> 13:04.727
And the citizens from the cities have complete faith
in the Church's ability to keep them safe.

13:04.760 --> 13:09.608
- You will not shake that faith.
- How good is that faith, when it's a lie?

13:09.644 --> 13:12.969
Questioning the authority of the
clergy is absolutely forbidden.

13:13.002 --> 13:15.837
If you take any action
to leave the cities...

13:15.872 --> 13:18.641
it will be seem as an act of
aggression against the Church.

13:18.675 --> 13:24.206
You will be stripped from the order and
excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?

13:25.283 --> 13:29.895
I said, do I make
myself clear, father?

13:30.663 --> 13:33.275
Yes, Monsignor.

13:35.273 --> 13:41.805
Try to remember your vow. To go against
the Church, is to go against God.

13:56.867 --> 14:01.400
Come on now. Don't be shy.

14:02.552 --> 14:05.051
Give us a kiss.

14:08.317 --> 14:10.545
That's no way to treat a friend.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.968
Please, let me go...

14:14.003 --> 14:16.354
You're in here for your own protection.

14:16.387 --> 14:20.805
If I let you out, you'll be
torn apart, piece by piece.

14:20.838 --> 14:25.146
My uncle's a priest, he'll come after me.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.495
Really?

14:27.528 --> 14:31.294
- What makes you so sure?
- He'll come after me.

14:31.831 --> 14:33.834
He'll come after you!

14:33.868 --> 14:40.015
Well that's something
I'm absolutely counting on.

14:45.202 --> 14:48.968
The judgment is final. I'm sorry.

14:52.311 --> 14:55.654
I sacrificed everything to serve them.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.264
- And they won't listen to me.
- The war is long over.

15:00.302 --> 15:02.492
You and the other
priests did your jobs.

15:02.525 --> 15:05.840
It's not over, not for me.

15:05.873 --> 15:08.223
You can't break your
covenant on a small ...

15:08.257 --> 15:10.638
group of savages, it would be sacrilege.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.828
I have to.

15:15.556 --> 15:20.937
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Move!

15:25.545 --> 15:30.080
If you go out there right now, you risk
stirring things up again.

15:31.118 --> 15:35.209
You have to look at the bigger picture,
it's for the greater good.

15:35.244 --> 15:39.302
- Is this the world I fought for?
- No.

15:39.839 --> 15:43.990
But it's the only world we have left.

15:44.023 --> 15:48.104
I'm begging you, don't do anything foolish.

15:48.137 --> 15:54.362
Remember your vow. To go against
the Church, is to go against God.

15:54.397 --> 15:57.630
Then I go against God.

16:23.563 --> 16:26.061
God help us.

16:27.483 --> 16:31.172
Dear Father, forgive me.

16:32.208 --> 16:35.251
It was never my intention
to offend you.

16:35.284 --> 16:40.085
I would like to firmly resolve
with the help of your grace...

16:40.163 --> 16:46.157
to sin no more, and to
avoid the near occasions of sin.

16:46.696 --> 16:49.614
But I can't.

18:54.487 --> 18:57.639
Looting's not such a good idea mister.

18:59.252 --> 19:01.288
Well, I'll be damned.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.242
Vampires are a vicious lie!

19:09.281 --> 19:15.236
I have seen a vampire
bite a man clean in half.

19:15.270 --> 19:19.044
Salvation is right
here in my very hands.

19:19.079 --> 19:21.228
Authenticated by the clergy themselves...

19:21.229 --> 19:24.228
- Purchase this holy water and...
- Excuse me in a minute.

19:24.267 --> 19:28.684
Keep your loved ones safe tonight...

19:30.989 --> 19:36.446
I'm tired of you comin' around here,
scaring people, selling your superstition.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.441
The show is over, and
it's time for you to go.

19:39.475 --> 19:42.977
Give me one good reason why I should.

19:44.514 --> 19:47.204
That's one... two...

19:47.237 --> 19:49.860
Alright. Alright, alright!

19:49.894 --> 19:53.235
Goddamn son of a bitch!

19:54.965 --> 19:57.078
You all listen up!

19:57.578 --> 20:00.075
This stuff is good for nothin'...

20:00.109 --> 20:02.539
but lining for that man's pockets
for your hard earned cash!

20:02.574 --> 20:06.800
You don't know that. You're just a kid.
We gotta do somethin' to keep us safe.

20:06.833 --> 20:09.220
Move out of the way!

20:10.065 --> 20:13.490
I don't blame any
of you for being scared,

20:13.523 --> 20:17.749
but the vampires are gone and
they're not coming back.

20:24.781 --> 20:29.392
You have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't to common out here.

20:31.851 --> 20:34.541
Is it true what they say about priests?

20:34.578 --> 20:36.960
You wield the hand of God?

20:41.188 --> 20:43.607
How is he?

20:44.146 --> 20:46.069
He's awake.

20:54.520 --> 20:58.479
Your clergy took away a boy...

20:59.130 --> 21:02.318
and returned an old man.

21:04.433 --> 21:07.780
After the war was over...

21:07.813 --> 21:10.503
Shannon figured you'd come back.

21:10.889 --> 21:13.578
I wanted to.

21:16.651 --> 21:19.495
Didn't seem right any more.

21:19.533 --> 21:22.766
I couldn't save her.

21:22.799 --> 21:27.178
I tried, but I've never had your gift.

21:27.793 --> 21:30.868
You gave her a life
I no longer could.

21:30.901 --> 21:34.367
I will always be
grateful to you for that.

21:34.402 --> 21:39.205
You know there ain't one day that
went by, where I wished she'd forget about you.

21:48.927 --> 21:54.460
You find Lucy,
you bring her home safe.

21:54.498 --> 21:57.916
And you promise me something brother.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.606
Kill 'em all.

22:04.680 --> 22:09.560
Most people out there know that the clergy
thinks of us as a bunch of godless heathens.

22:09.593 --> 22:14.439
And that's how we like it. It means that
they tend to keep their noses out of our business.

22:14.477 --> 22:19.550
So you can imagine how surprised I was when
they contacted me asking if I'd seen you.

22:19.583 --> 22:24.275
Saying that anyone going after Lucy
is to be arrested immediately.

22:24.309 --> 22:27.200
Said she's in God's hands now.

22:27.234 --> 22:31.114
Problem is, we both now outside
a week Lucy will be dead...

22:31.148 --> 22:35.033
or worse, infected.

22:35.110 --> 22:38.262
So with all due respect to god...

22:46.944 --> 22:49.102
You're wasting your time.

22:49.135 --> 22:54.013
No, no! You're not cutting me out of this!
I'm the one that came and got you!

22:54.052 --> 22:57.473
People in this town don't think
you can keep them safe here.

22:58.548 --> 23:01.814
What makes you think you'll
do any good out there?

23:15.531 --> 23:19.296
- You any good with a gun?
- Better than I am with a knife.

23:20.141 --> 23:23.061
We leave at dawn.

23:24.867 --> 23:28.825
What's with all the bullets anyway?
I thought priests didn't use firearms.

23:28.860 --> 23:31.531
We don't.

23:31.565 --> 23:34.205
They're for you.

23:52.531 --> 23:55.491
You have been called
to serve once more.

23:55.529 --> 23:59.659
One of your own has
broken his sacred vow.

23:59.694 --> 24:03.789
His actions are a threat
to the entire order.

24:04.250 --> 24:09.322
You will find him
and bring him back to me.

24:10.475 --> 24:13.166
Dead or alive.

24:20.075 --> 24:23.566
Then I will teach transgressed your ways
and return them back to you.

24:24.575 --> 24:28.566
Save me from blood guilt...
and god who saves me and my tongue...

24:28.567 --> 24:32.966
will sing of your righteousness...
in my mouth declare your prays...

25:02.461 --> 25:05.886
- What is it?
- Vampire tracks are random...

25:05.919 --> 25:09.344
in sets of 2, 3 or 4 prints at a time,
but these are two by two.

25:09.378 --> 25:11.948
Must have been some of the familiars.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.948
Vampires don't bring familiars
in the hunt, they slow them down.

25:15.717 --> 25:18.407
All this...

25:19.174 --> 25:21.672
this was something else.

25:22.441 --> 25:24.443
Tracks head north.

25:24.478 --> 25:28.320
- There's a reservation up that way.
- Well, then. That's where we start.

25:40.499 --> 25:45.110
Mangshane Reservation.
Nothing but red-outs and rejects.

25:45.143 --> 25:47.497
They're a fallen tribe.

25:47.532 --> 25:50.681
Either way, we don't have
much time to get in and out.

26:11.043 --> 26:13.926
No guards.

26:28.412 --> 26:31.223
I thought familiars were illegal.

26:31.256 --> 26:34.098
Nobody really enforces it, as long
as it's voluntary.

26:34.133 --> 26:37.227
- Voluntary?
- Yeah, they come from the fringes.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.323
Drifters that want to get infected.

26:41.091 --> 26:44.742
I mean becoming a vampire
so they may live among them.

26:44.775 --> 26:48.393
These people get all sorts of strange ideas.
As long as they keep to themselves...

26:48.431 --> 26:51.004
it makes no difference to me.

27:08.678 --> 27:11.368
You're not welcome here, Priest.

27:11.403 --> 27:13.865
These lands are protected.

27:14.135 --> 27:16.824
No! I got this.

27:17.440 --> 27:21.435
I'm looking for a local girl, kidnapped
about four nights ago by a vamp-pack.

27:21.474 --> 27:25.277
- They came through this way.
- Nobody comes through Nightshade.

27:25.316 --> 27:28.275
It's the way we like it. Nice...

27:29.619 --> 27:31.891
and quiet.

27:31.925 --> 27:35.383
Good, we're sure we
won't have any trouble.

28:16.110 --> 28:20.069
They excrete it, use
it to build the hives.

28:41.354 --> 28:44.658
I guess now we know what
happened to the guards.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.263
No. No, no, you must not...

28:56.296 --> 28:58.643
The Master will be angry...

29:00.795 --> 29:03.452
Where's the girl?

29:03.485 --> 29:06.328
I don't know what you're
talking about. Please! Please!

29:06.367 --> 29:09.518
The Master doesn't
feed humans anymore.

29:09.553 --> 29:12.091
Yeah, tell that to the guards.

29:13.359 --> 29:15.934
- Where is she?
- Please don't, don't...

29:15.974 --> 29:18.355
Where is she?

29:20.974 --> 29:22.355
Shit!

29:27.769 --> 29:30.458
Priest! Priest!

29:51.283 --> 29:53.434
Save your bullets.

30:19.640 --> 30:23.175
Now, we can do this the easy way or...

30:23.789 --> 30:27.400
God. I always preferred the hard way.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.318
- Tell me where they took the girl.
- Haven't you done enough already, priest?

30:32.351 --> 30:35.853
- Tell me!
- Look around you. Look what you've done to them.

30:35.892 --> 30:39.446
They once ruled this land, they were
warriors, they were Gods.

30:39.481 --> 30:43.000
- They were murderers.
- They were what nature made them to be.

30:43.035 --> 30:47.611
- Just like you.
- You got 10 seconds to start talking.

30:51.338 --> 30:55.373
Then 10 seconds is all I need.
You're too late, Priest.

30:55.564 --> 30:59.292
It is their time now.

31:02.749 --> 31:06.322
- Did you get your gun on?
- Why?

31:06.356 --> 31:09.128
You're gonna need it.

31:41.940 --> 31:45.784
Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

31:45.823 --> 31:48.703
- I will fear no evil,
- Your words mean nothing to them, Priest.

31:48.736 --> 31:50.892
For thou art with me.

32:23.053 --> 32:25.205
Focus!

32:47.259 --> 32:50.640
- Should we go after them?
- No need, they'll die at first light.

32:50.673 --> 32:55.558
No more masters, just you and me.

32:58.325 --> 33:00.520
Tell me where they took the girl.

33:00.553 --> 33:04.471
- West. They took her west.
- Why?

33:04.506 --> 33:06.777
You have no idea
what's coming, Priest.

33:39.129 --> 33:42.126
The familiar said they
travel west from here.

33:44.432 --> 33:48.355
- Solar mirror.
- A hive?

33:48.390 --> 33:50.307
One of the largest.

33:50.310 --> 33:52.807
But I thought all of the hives
were liquidated after the war.

33:52.841 --> 33:54.771
They were.

33:54.804 --> 33:57.001
That's why we need to go look.

33:57.034 --> 34:00.722
There are more than 50
creeps in this reservation.

34:00.757 --> 34:04.411
But only 6 vampires left. The weak.

34:04.987 --> 34:09.021
They left behind.
We find the missing one, we find Lucy.

34:14.978 --> 34:17.936
I may not have seen the war...

34:17.975 --> 34:22.279
but I know the look a man gets
when he likes killing.

34:22.312 --> 34:25.235
It comes easy to you.

34:27.080 --> 34:30.154
It just comes.

34:30.346 --> 34:33.612
Easy's got nothing to do with it.

34:35.841 --> 34:38.107
Give me your gun.

34:38.606 --> 34:42.065
- What?
- Give me your gun.

34:46.368 --> 34:49.751
Vampires don't move like humans.

34:50.210 --> 34:53.706
Their body weight pulls them
in concentric patterns.

34:56.666 --> 34:59.932
You need to anticipate their
trajectory to get a kill shot.

34:59.967 --> 35:04.043
- Are you teaching me to shoot?
- I'm teaching you how to kill vampires.

35:04.081 --> 35:08.000
There are always two points.
A and B.

35:08.500 --> 35:12.342
Know them both, you'll kill a vampire.

35:23.638 --> 35:27.711
A man came aboard.
Says he got something for you.

35:32.975 --> 35:36.432
You told me to come.

35:36.466 --> 35:39.858
I have information, but I...

35:39.893 --> 35:43.157
before I tell you, I
hate to bring this up.

35:43.190 --> 35:47.746
But there is this small little
matter of compensation.

35:47.780 --> 35:52.268
Now, you've been really
good for business.

35:52.303 --> 35:56.143
So I am more than
willing to cut you a deal.

35:56.874 --> 36:00.447
I can smell the blood
running through you veins?

36:00.480 --> 36:03.598
Smells like dinner.

36:03.638 --> 36:07.056
Okay. Alright.

36:07.095 --> 36:12.359
After you snatched the girl, a couple
of nights later, a priest showed up.

36:12.393 --> 36:16.474
- Priest?
- And he was with this Sheriff,

36:16.509 --> 36:21.772
real hard case. He run me out of town
before I could make a single sell.

36:22.540 --> 36:25.806
- You've done well.
- Thank you.

36:41.368 --> 36:43.942
There's your compensation.

36:44.557 --> 36:47.400
Put him to work.

37:29.665 --> 37:33.161
I used to ride out a lot
here when I was little.

37:33.194 --> 37:36.008
Stared at all this stuff.

37:36.042 --> 37:38.810
Wondered what it used to be.

37:39.386 --> 37:44.113
After a while,
it just made my eyes ache.

37:46.493 --> 37:51.104
Did Owen know about you and Lucy?

37:56.098 --> 37:58.482
No, no.

38:00.249 --> 38:04.245
She wanted to tell him, but...

38:05.129 --> 38:08.554
Owen wasn't the easiest man to talk to.

38:08.587 --> 38:14.542
Besides, he was so focused on his work
there wasn't much room for anything else.

38:15.004 --> 38:17.540
Do you love her?

38:28.298 --> 38:31.834
You know if she's infected...

38:32.984 --> 38:35.674
I'll kill her.

38:38.363 --> 38:41.516
You'll try...

38:41.553 --> 38:44.512
but you won't be able to.

38:44.819 --> 38:48.931
I wasn't there to protect her once,
I won't make that same mistake again.

39:52.519 --> 39:56.825
- Feels like a grave.
- It's a trap.

40:04.354 --> 40:07.197
This is a waste of time,
there's nothing here.

40:07.236 --> 40:12.385
Stay here, if anything comes up
that isn't me, shoot it.

40:17.802 --> 40:20.299
Great.

41:41.061 --> 41:46.442
- What are you doing here?
- The Clergy sent me. Ordered me to bring you back.

41:47.480 --> 41:51.054
They sent four of us to track you.
We split up at Nightshade.

41:51.087 --> 41:54.702
I rode out here and
hoped they didn't have you.

41:54.736 --> 41:57.777
The others went up to Jericho.

41:58.353 --> 42:00.850
I didn't believe it when they
told me you broke your vow.

42:00.883 --> 42:04.233
They left me no choice.
Hicks!

42:05.846 --> 42:08.228
What the hell is that thing?

42:08.267 --> 42:11.191
- A hive guardian.
- Who the hell are you?!

42:11.224 --> 42:14.376
It's too big to get down here.
Which is the only reason you're still alive.

42:14.413 --> 42:16.566
Who the hell is that?

42:16.599 --> 42:18.717
Are you ready?

42:42.599 --> 42:44.717
Hey!

43:59.054 --> 44:02.075
Not bad.

44:07.338 --> 44:11.181
Point A, meet point fucking B.

44:11.218 --> 44:15.023
The hive's been abandoned for years.
Why would something be protecting it?

44:17.634 --> 44:19.259
Does the lawman know what
you'll do if she's infected?

44:19.264 --> 44:21.669
He knows.

44:21.703 --> 44:26.282
- He'll try to stop you.
- He won't be able to.

44:30.007 --> 44:32.779
It's been hard all these years...

44:32.814 --> 44:36.463
not seeing the others, not talking.

44:36.846 --> 44:39.921
Sector 7 was the only
place I could find work.

44:39.954 --> 44:42.115
Waste management.

44:42.148 --> 44:46.374
No one would hire me.
"No applicable skills."

44:46.409 --> 44:49.142
I heard that, too.

44:50.679 --> 44:53.752
I didn't come here to bring you back.

44:53.785 --> 44:56.825
I came here to warn you.

45:00.208 --> 45:05.439
There are nights when I wake up...

45:05.471 --> 45:08.738
I think I'm back on the red mines.

45:10.083 --> 45:15.846
I'm sweating. My muscles are clenched
like, like I'm ready for something.

45:16.999 --> 45:20.340
Nights like that,
I don't go back to sleep.

45:20.379 --> 45:23.337
I have bad dreams.

45:23.373 --> 45:25.643
Me, too.

45:30.562 --> 45:34.672
There are other nights, the good nights...

45:34.706 --> 45:38.783
I dream about other things.

45:54.061 --> 46:00.686
- Why doesn't it look like the rest of the hive?
- This sections new. They must have rebuilt it.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.552
My God.

46:19.051 --> 46:21.663
They bread a new army.

46:22.893 --> 46:25.274
Where did they all go?

46:30.269 --> 46:33.575
Only one way to find out.

46:40.106 --> 46:42.762
Are priests allowed to have relations?

46:42.797 --> 46:46.331
- We take a vow of celibacy.
- So, you mean you've never...

46:46.365 --> 46:49.865
I was a young girl when
the Clergy found me.

46:49.903 --> 46:52.287
What about him?

46:52.862 --> 46:54.050
His talents developed later.

46:54.162 --> 46:58.050
He was nearly you're age
when the Clergy came for him.

46:58.434 --> 47:01.893
That made his sacrifice
greater than most.

47:02.776 --> 47:05.542
The air is changing.

47:06.295 --> 47:07.694
Well, there's your answer.

47:07.932 --> 47:09.926
They dug right
through the mountain and...

47:10.060 --> 47:13.226
made a hole big enough to fit
an army through.

47:13.788 --> 47:16.877
What town is that?

47:16.910 --> 47:19.649
It's Jericho.

47:19.682 --> 47:23.294
Where'd you say the others went?

47:36.740 --> 47:38.814
What the hell?

48:25.053 --> 48:27.959
Hello?!

48:34.089 --> 48:35.764
Hello!

48:43.095 --> 48:46.017
Is anybody there?

49:03.191 --> 49:05.496
Let's begin.

49:35.467 --> 49:37.618
I don't see anything.

50:45.011 --> 50:48.665
Brothers, you have a choice.

50:48.700 --> 50:54.155
You can follow in my footsteps
or you can follow in his.

51:12.675 --> 51:14.795
We're too late.

51:14.828 --> 51:19.131
We separate. Go through
each building, and see what we find.

52:38.857 --> 52:43.200
There's nobody left. Not a soul.

52:43.233 --> 52:46.349
Too many mouths to feed.

53:15.476 --> 53:20.352
Killing three priests? What kind of
vampire could do something like that?

53:20.739 --> 53:23.695
Nothing we've ever seen before.

53:24.196 --> 53:28.154
How could they take an entire town
over night, and vanish by sunrise?

53:28.187 --> 53:32.533
There are no other hives around
here, no reservations.

53:41.601 --> 53:44.791
- Where does this rail line go?
- It's an old mining line.

53:44.825 --> 53:47.985
It starts in the Dunkirk
mine above Augustine.

53:48.018 --> 53:51.361
- Jericho's the last stop before it reaches...
- The cities.

53:51.400 --> 53:54.358
Heading back to the cities
would be suicide, right?

53:54.391 --> 53:58.662
- The sun will kill them.
- There is no sun in the cities.

53:58.699 --> 54:01.351
Not anymore.

54:01.389 --> 54:04.656
Without us, they're defenseless.

54:05.961 --> 54:08.958
- I'm responsible.
- No, this was systematic.

54:08.991 --> 54:11.956
Whoever took Lucy knew
that you'd come for her...

54:11.989 --> 54:14.496
and that we'd come for you.
They were drawing us out.

54:14.530 --> 54:16.010
They must have been
picking up different factions

54:16.011 --> 54:19.410
along the way, moving during
the day and feeding at night.

54:19.448 --> 54:23.271
- It's going to be a massacre.
- It's going to be a war.

54:23.304 --> 54:27.095
Train carrying an army of vampires?

54:27.709 --> 54:30.399
What chance do we have
stopping something like that?

54:31.704 --> 54:35.278
I'll overtake the train and blow the rail-line.
You two get aboard and find Lucy.

54:35.311 --> 54:38.357
I'll start charging the bikes.
It's gonna take everything we have

54:38.390 --> 54:41.542
to stop that train before
it reaches the cities.

54:48.842 --> 54:52.683
You must be starving.
You haven't eaten in days.

54:54.221 --> 54:59.101
Have you ever had a real roast duck?

54:59.484 --> 55:03.710
It's very rare, very exotic.

55:05.516 --> 55:11.665
- Of course not.
- Try it, you'll never have better.

55:14.584 --> 55:19.929
- What do you want?
- I want the same things that you want.

55:19.963 --> 55:24.344
I want to be free from a life
of suffering and sacrifice.

55:24.383 --> 55:29.453
To no longer be told that your
every desire is a sin.

55:29.568 --> 55:36.178
And after all, if you're not
committing sin, you're no longer having fun.

55:45.015 --> 55:48.055
What are you?

55:48.088 --> 55:52.973
The Church teaches us that the eyes
are the window to the soul...

55:53.008 --> 55:59.155
and since the vampire evolved
without eyes, it is a soulless creature...

55:59.190 --> 56:02.463
to be eradicated.

56:02.496 --> 56:06.474
And I have seen the soul of the vampire.
And let me tell you...

56:06.508 --> 56:10.452
it is far more pure
than that of any man.

56:10.489 --> 56:14.139
Now you ask me what I am?

56:15.292 --> 56:18.409
I am the bringer of the tide...

56:18.443 --> 56:22.745
I am the wave to wash clean
this unclean world.

56:23.246 --> 56:27.030
And you and your priest...

56:27.064 --> 56:30.815
will help me do it.

56:33.735 --> 56:39.113
He's gonna kill her, isn't he?
If she's infected?

56:44.262 --> 56:48.605
She talked about him.
Said she never got to known him.

56:48.912 --> 56:51.376
She wanted to.

56:51.409 --> 56:54.911
What kind of man would kill
his own flesh and blood?

56:54.944 --> 56:58.479
If she becomes a familiar,
she's no ones flesh and blood.

56:59.363 --> 57:02.244
Not anymore.

57:39.591 --> 57:44.049
I've held on to it all these years...

57:44.971 --> 57:48.658
to remind me of everything they've
stripped away from us.

57:48.692 --> 57:52.577
Our honor, our abilities, our faith...

57:53.731 --> 57:55.150
Today when we ride,
I want you to remember

57:55.151 --> 57:58.150
our power doesn't
come from the Church...

57:58.183 --> 58:00.723
it comes from God.

58:10.715 --> 58:15.247
With or without the Clergy,
we're still priests.

58:35.535 --> 58:38.686
I can't.

58:47.905 --> 58:51.173
When I heard what
happened to Shannon...

58:51.206 --> 58:54.745
I prayed for her salvation.

58:54.780 --> 58:57.896
And then I prayed for mine.

58:58.280 --> 59:02.320
Because in the
darkness of my heart...

59:02.353 --> 59:06.425
I hoped her death
would free you at last.

59:49.305 --> 59:53.226
- Tell me you won't kill her.
- Hicks, don't do this.

59:53.260 --> 59:56.264
Tell me, or I will
shoot you where you stand.

59:56.298 --> 59:59.372
It would be easier to face you bullet here
than face what may lie up ahead.

59:59.405 --> 01:00:03.601
Why do you even care?
She is nothing but a stranger to you.

01:00:08.516 --> 01:00:11.634
She's his daughter.

01:00:11.667 --> 01:00:16.087
- She was just a baby when the Clergy took me.
- You're lying. I knew Owen.

01:00:16.121 --> 01:00:19.045
The child needed a father.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:22.619
We all made sacrifices.

01:00:26.267 --> 01:00:29.035
Hicks.

01:00:29.419 --> 01:00:35.106
If you do this,
it won't matter if you find Lucy.

01:00:35.683 --> 01:00:40.408
It won't stop the train, and
you won't be able to save her.

01:00:41.946 --> 01:00:44.710
You won't save her.

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:58.158
We ride out and meet this together.

01:01:13.528 --> 01:01:17.754
When the time comes, you blow the tracks
and then you get out of there!

01:01:17.788 --> 01:01:21.021
What if you're still on the train?

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.741
Good-luck.

01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:48.108
Focus!

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:43.514
Holy shit.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:22.628
Hello, my friend.

01:03:42.415 --> 01:03:45.105
- You fell!
- You let go!

01:03:47.295 --> 01:03:52.904
In the depths of that hive, I crossed
the threshold between life and death.

01:03:52.937 --> 01:03:55.748
And do you know what I found?

01:03:57.285 --> 01:04:02.280
The queen we had come to kill,
my angel of mercy.

01:04:02.895 --> 01:04:06.890
She turned me into something that
had never existed in this world.

01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:11.808
A human vampire.

01:04:13.038 --> 01:04:16.496
Join me.
Accept the blood of the queen.

01:04:16.535 --> 01:04:20.338
And together we can return to the cities...

01:04:20.377 --> 01:04:22.456
as brothers.

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:27.639
- Where's my daughter?
- Waiting for your decision.

01:04:46.697 --> 01:04:50.693
You can't win.
I'm stronger now than you ever were.

01:07:14.009 --> 01:07:16.620
This is your last chance, Priest.

01:07:16.655 --> 01:07:19.200
The queens hands have not been idle.

01:07:19.233 --> 01:07:22.461
Mankind will find no
quarter from what's coming.

01:07:22.499 --> 01:07:27.456
Join me, and your life of
sacrifice will be over.

01:07:27.493 --> 01:07:29.569
Never.

01:08:26.742 --> 01:08:29.046
Hicks!

01:08:29.081 --> 01:08:31.354
Lucy!

01:08:42.495 --> 01:08:45.267
- Fuck.
- Did you find her?

01:08:45.301 --> 01:08:48.836
I couldn't get close.
They took her to the front.

01:09:07.548 --> 01:09:11.966
- You would have made a good priest.
- Thanks.

01:09:12.005 --> 01:09:14.002
Don't let it go to your head.

01:09:22.005 --> 01:09:24.502
- Hicks!
- Lucy!

01:09:29.505 --> 01:09:31.002
No!

01:09:49.542 --> 01:09:52.425
Stop it!

01:09:59.916 --> 01:10:02.111
No, Lucy!

01:10:02.147 --> 01:10:04.221
Very good!
Fast.

01:10:04.259 --> 01:10:07.025
Just like your father.

01:10:09.907 --> 01:10:13.058
He never told you?

01:10:22.007 --> 01:10:24.658
Oh, god!

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.485
Burn.

01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:57.935
At this time of need,
strengthen me.

01:11:00.816 --> 01:11:04.333
You are my refuge and strength...

01:11:04.366 --> 01:11:07.849
I do not fear, for you are with me.

01:12:21.773 --> 01:12:24.463
I won't let you go!

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:32.377
Your faith has failed you!

01:12:45.596 --> 01:12:47.747
No!

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:57.000
For the life of the
flesh is in the blood.

01:14:57.039 --> 01:15:00.573
And I have given it
to you upon the altar...

01:15:00.606 --> 01:15:04.877
to make atonement for your souls.

01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:21.974
How dare you come back
to this holy place?

01:15:22.013 --> 01:15:28.239
A man who would defy the Church,
for his own selfish crusade!

01:15:41.033 --> 01:15:44.251
Look inside the burning train just
behind these cities walls...

01:15:45.528 --> 01:15:48.761
you'll find hundreds more like it.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:52.366
- And their queen was not among them.
- Lies!

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.939
This man is a charlatan.
A risk to the security of the cities.

01:15:58.975 --> 01:16:02.017
There is no vampire menace!

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:06.009
- The war is over, Priest!
- No.

01:16:06.042 --> 01:16:08.689
It's just beginning.

01:16:19.802 --> 01:16:24.528
I've notified the others. We'll meet you
at the rendezvous at City 7.

01:16:26.255 --> 01:16:28.945
Godspeed!
