00:07.500 --> 00:09.500
<i>This here's
the only world that I got.</i>

00:09.500 --> 00:11.458
What is it?

00:11.458 --> 00:12.833
Cutting-edge VR, Flynne.

00:12.833 --> 00:14.500
Folks want me to beta test it.

00:18.458 --> 00:19.791
<i>Well, hello.</i>

00:19.875 --> 00:21.916
<i>Welcome to the Sim, Easy Ice.</i>

00:23.166 --> 00:24.208
Are you ready?

00:25.916 --> 00:27.250
Holy shit.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.958
I can't help but think
that I was actually there.

00:30.958 --> 00:32.625
Somewhere that's real.

00:32.625 --> 00:35.000
<i>Ms. Fisher,
you're in grave danger.</i>

00:35.000 --> 00:36.083
<i>The situation is
far more complex</i>

00:36.083 --> 00:37.541
<i>than you can possibly imagine.</i>

00:37.625 --> 00:39.375
<i>It's crucial that
you log back into the sim.</i>

00:42.375 --> 00:44.500
I may need you
to endure

00:44.500 --> 00:46.083
terrible pain
in the coming hours.

00:47.291 --> 00:51.291
<i>I assure you it's for
a very noble cause, all right?</i>

00:51.375 --> 00:52.625
<i>Someone from that company's</i>

00:52.625 --> 00:54.416
<i>trying to contact me.</i>

00:54.500 --> 00:57.208
<i>He says someone
put a hit out on us.</i>

00:57.208 --> 00:59.125
For $9 million
on the dark net.

01:11.208 --> 01:14.333
<i>A breach of this
magnitude puts all of us here</i>

01:14.333 --> 01:16.958
<i>at the Research Institute
in profound peril.</i>

01:16.958 --> 01:18.708
<i>You've disappointed me, Daniel.</i>

01:18.708 --> 01:20.083
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

01:20.083 --> 01:22.791
We traced the operator.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.875
His location and temporality

01:25.875 --> 01:29.083
complicate the situation,
of course.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.583
But we've taken
the necessary steps

01:31.583 --> 01:33.041
to eliminate the threat.

01:33.125 --> 01:34.541
Those being?

01:34.625 --> 01:37.041
We've put up a posting
on something called

01:37.125 --> 01:38.958
the dark web.

01:38.958 --> 01:41.666
- It's a...
- Yes, I know what it is.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.291
Has the offer been accepted?

01:43.375 --> 01:45.666
- Almost immediately.
- By a reliable party?

01:45.750 --> 01:48.375
Ex-military. Elite unit.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.750
We'll be providing
some assistance

01:49.750 --> 01:51.000
on the technical side.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.458
Well, it's not just him
that we need dead.

01:54.458 --> 01:58.083
It's anyone even remotely
associated with him.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.083
Well, the posting
was quite explicit

02:00.083 --> 02:01.750
in this regard, ma'am.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.000
Scorched earth.

02:08.875 --> 02:10.083
Drone inbound.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.500
Get Mama in the basement.

02:14.583 --> 02:15.708
Can you hack it?

02:16.625 --> 02:18.541
I need a bunch of dumbass
drunks around the fire.

02:18.625 --> 02:19.833
Not much motion.

02:27.708 --> 02:31.000
Get it done, Reece,
or we go without it.

02:33.083 --> 02:34.750
Mama!

02:44.208 --> 02:46.000
Done. Link me.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.041
These sorry
motherfuckers have no idea

02:49.125 --> 02:50.916
who they just picked
a fight with.

02:52.291 --> 02:53.458
Linked.

02:54.750 --> 02:55.958
Linked.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.208
Linked.

03:02.166 --> 03:03.291
Okay.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.125
You've got
your long guns?

03:22.708 --> 03:24.875
Mama. Mama. Wake up.

03:24.875 --> 03:25.958
Mama, wake up right now.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.041
<i>Mama, wake up!</i>

03:34.125 --> 03:35.666
Mama, get up.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.833
Stay down!

04:16.916 --> 04:18.625
Back up, back up!

05:48.375 --> 05:49.750
Where is it?

06:06.125 --> 06:09.166
Fuck. Come on, fucker.
Come on.

06:17.666 --> 06:19.208
Stop!

06:19.208 --> 06:21.083
Drop your fucking gun now!

06:41.416 --> 06:43.208
- Mama?
- It's all right.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.916
- She slept through
the whole thing.
- Problem.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.916
- Only seeing ten bodies.
- One's in the house.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.250
Counted.
Still two missing.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.250
Play it back.

06:55.875 --> 06:56.875
LMG team.

07:01.041 --> 07:02.625
They hacked us back.

07:03.541 --> 07:05.500
Motherfucker!

07:11.791 --> 07:13.083
One's on the move!

07:18.333 --> 07:20.583
- Low on ammo here.
- Here, too.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.375
Ain't about to be
running up that ridge,

07:32.375 --> 07:33.375
if that's what you're thinking.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.208
Not asking you to.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.708
Burton!

07:59.833 --> 08:00.833
Who is that?

08:02.041 --> 08:04.833
Will someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

08:10.166 --> 08:12.083
<i>Your little sister said</i>

08:12.083 --> 08:13.750
<i>I should stop by for a beer.</i>

08:18.833 --> 08:20.541
She ain't say nothin' about you

08:20.625 --> 08:22.166
throwing such
a fun party, though.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.041
<i>Aelita.</i>

10:12.583 --> 10:13.583
Aelita.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.791
I thought that was you.
What are the chances?

10:17.875 --> 10:19.458
You're pretending, Wolf.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.083
Why would you say that?

10:21.083 --> 10:23.541
You have two choices.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.958
You can tell me the truth,
why you've tracked me down,

10:25.958 --> 10:27.958
or you can fuck off
back up the street.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.166
I know a person who's looking
for some information

10:30.250 --> 10:32.416
about your current
place of employment.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.291
The Research Institute?

10:34.375 --> 10:37.750
And this person you know,
he's a fool, is he?

10:39.416 --> 10:40.625
As far as I can see,

10:40.625 --> 10:42.791
there's three possible
categories at play.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.458
Fool. Klept. Maybe the Met...

10:45.458 --> 10:47.000
He's not a fool.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.750
So a klept, then.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.583
Now why would I want
to get entangled

10:50.583 --> 10:52.416
with such an unpalatable world?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.041
There would be
a sum of money involved

10:54.125 --> 10:56.208
that will carry you
far beyond the level of need.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.958
I don't want money.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.500
Are you happy, Aelita?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.416
Every morning...

11:07.500 --> 11:09.833
- Don't you fucking
dare do that.
- ...I'd ask you,

11:09.833 --> 11:11.458
"Are you happy?"

11:11.458 --> 11:13.500
And every time,
you'd give me the same answer.

11:14.583 --> 11:15.916
Despite all that was going on,

11:16.000 --> 11:17.416
the desolation all around us.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.125
"Yes." "Yes."

11:21.916 --> 11:23.208
"Yes."

11:25.666 --> 11:27.666
Do you still wake up like that?

11:28.750 --> 11:31.333
So this is altruism,
is it?

11:31.333 --> 11:33.416
Is there a finder's fee
for the Good Samaritan?

11:33.500 --> 11:35.416
Both can exist, can't they?

11:35.500 --> 11:37.041
Self-interest and altruism?

11:38.500 --> 11:39.625
I'm quite serious.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.583
You really don't
seem happy to me.

11:42.916 --> 11:44.041
The individual you know,

11:44.125 --> 11:46.166
his overture, or whatever
you want to call it,

11:46.250 --> 11:49.166
it's gonna make me happy, is it?

11:49.250 --> 11:51.708
A little bit of intrigue,
to liven up your days.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.458
Where's the harm in that?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.541
Hello?

12:06.625 --> 12:07.541
<i>Good God, Wilf,</i>

12:07.625 --> 12:09.125
<i>you sound like hell.</i>

12:09.125 --> 12:11.333
The hour may have something
to do with that, Lev.

12:11.333 --> 12:14.916
Which should give a sense
of the urgency at play.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- I've sent a car.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.708
It's waiting downstairs.

12:18.708 --> 12:19.875
It's 5:00
in the fucking morning.

12:19.875 --> 12:20.875
I'm not going anywhere.

12:20.875 --> 12:23.333
I pay you a retainer,

12:23.333 --> 12:25.666
quite a generous one
if I'm not mistaken.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.916
Given what I understand
to be the going rate for...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.291
um, what is it you call
yourself again, Wilf?

12:31.375 --> 12:32.583
A "fixer"?

12:33.625 --> 12:37.125
<i>I do admire the brute
simplicity of the title.</i>

12:37.125 --> 12:39.500
All I'm asking
is that you do your job.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.791
Fix a problem of mine,

12:40.875 --> 12:42.291
and fix it now.

12:42.375 --> 12:44.291
<i>The bounty</i>

12:44.375 --> 12:47.041
<i>on the girl and her family,
someone tried to claim it.</i>

12:47.125 --> 12:50.875
<i>Or to be more precise,
a team of someones.</i>

12:50.875 --> 12:53.250
And rather violently.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.291
We got lucky,

12:55.375 --> 12:57.416
but our good fortune
isn't likely to last.

12:57.500 --> 13:02.500
So my technicals have built
the girl a Peripheral.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.916
<i>I need you to get her
inside it now.</i>

13:07.916 --> 13:10.458
She's our best chance
of finding Aelita.

13:26.458 --> 13:30.500
I can sense your glare
of disapproval, Ash.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.583
What is it now?

13:34.666 --> 13:36.375
Your friend, Mr. Netherton.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.375
I worry your personal attachment

13:39.375 --> 13:41.000
might be affecting
your judgment.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.916
That he's not
the right man for the job.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.208
Because...?

13:47.208 --> 13:49.625
He's the sort
you pay to carry

13:49.625 --> 13:52.208
a bag of money to someone,

13:52.208 --> 13:54.041
isn't he?

13:54.125 --> 13:56.333
Slippery. Unmemorable.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.958
The type authorities
overlook because

13:58.958 --> 14:00.375
he's not like you.

14:00.375 --> 14:01.458
He's not a...

14:01.458 --> 14:03.916
A wealthy bon vivant?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.958
A descendant of an illustrious
Russian bloodline?

14:06.958 --> 14:08.666
A patron to the arts?

14:08.750 --> 14:09.708
A killer.

14:11.541 --> 14:13.583
He's just a pet.

14:13.583 --> 14:16.708
Obliging and sweet.

14:16.708 --> 14:20.375
And the current situation
may require us

14:20.375 --> 14:21.916
to be a little bit more...

14:22.000 --> 14:23.625
Brutal?

14:25.333 --> 14:28.541
One day I'll share with you
how I first met Wilf.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.500
He doesn't like
to talk about it.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.833
Quite modest, really.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.125
But let's just say,

14:33.125 --> 14:36.708
when it comes to
his capacity for violence,

14:36.708 --> 14:38.291
he is one of the family.

14:38.375 --> 14:41.625
Especially when
properly motivated.

14:41.625 --> 14:45.666
And no one could possibly
be more motivated

14:45.750 --> 14:50.208
to find Aelita
than Wilf Netherton.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.541
I'm sorry, Flynne.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.291
I know this is the last thing
you want to do,

14:57.375 --> 14:58.541
but we need the intel.

16:20.708 --> 16:22.541
If you'd like it altered
in any way,

16:22.625 --> 16:24.583
we can easily accommodate you.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.875
I'm Wilf Netherton.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.291
I'll be as direct as possible,

16:32.375 --> 16:34.500
since neither of us
has time for anything else.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.958
I'm trying to find a woman.

16:35.958 --> 16:37.125
Aelita West.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.458
If I'm not mistaken,

16:38.458 --> 16:40.791
you might be the last person
to have seen her.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.958
You see, I'm thinking
you should probably tell me

16:47.958 --> 16:50.625
why people are trying to come
and kill me and my family first.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.666
And then, maybe I'll go and play

16:52.750 --> 16:54.125
your stupid missing-lady sim.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.666
You aren't playing a sim,
Ms. Fisher.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.208
You're inside what we
call a Peripheral.

16:59.208 --> 17:01.083
Telepresent.

17:01.083 --> 17:04.125
Piloting that body
as if it were your own.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.916
And all this, it...

17:08.833 --> 17:10.041
Let me show you.

17:53.416 --> 17:55.125
This ain't London.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.458
Why would you say that?

17:57.458 --> 18:00.000
 Where are
all the people?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.958
 Well, that's where things
begin to get a bit tricky.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.708
This is London.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.291
But London 70 years from what
you think of as the present.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.458
I'm sorry, you really just
expect me to swallow that?

18:15.458 --> 18:17.458
That I've time traveled here?

18:18.541 --> 18:19.875
To future London?

18:19.875 --> 18:21.166
No.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.458
Not at all.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.708
If it were time travel,
as you say,

18:24.708 --> 18:26.166
you'd be here physically.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.875
This is merely a matter
of data transfer.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.208
Quantum tunneling is
the technical term for it.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.458
It's...

18:32.791 --> 18:33.875
I understand your confusion.

18:33.875 --> 18:36.250
No, I'm not confused at all, actually.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.333
I just don't believe you.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.000
You'd like my bona fides?

18:40.875 --> 18:42.291
Your mother.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.333
She has a brain tumor.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.791
A glioma.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.083
Okay. You don't really need
to be from the future

18:49.083 --> 18:51.291
- to know that one.
- It's going to kill her
in four weeks.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.625
On September the 22nd.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.041
Late in the evening.

18:56.166 --> 18:57.708
That's not true.

18:57.708 --> 18:59.250
Doctor told her
it won't do her in.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.125
They said there's plenty of
stuff in line ahead of that.

19:01.125 --> 19:03.000
Has her pain been intensifying?

19:04.500 --> 19:05.708
That's usually the first sign.

19:29.625 --> 19:32.083
We've developed a drug
to treat gliomas.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.708
Rather easily.

19:33.708 --> 19:36.208
It's like spraying a weed,
more or less.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.666
I've sent the formula
to your pharmacy.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.375
They're printing it now.

19:39.375 --> 19:41.125
We can't afford Pharma Jon.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.666
We wired payment
direct to the pharmacy.

19:48.916 --> 19:52.208
Think on it, Ms. Fisher.
But with alacrity.

19:52.208 --> 19:55.333
The situation is urgent.
I can't stress that enough.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.458
You and your family...
You remain in grave danger.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.833
Those men who came to kill you,

20:01.833 --> 20:03.500
they won't be the last.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.625
You need my help to stop them.

20:06.625 --> 20:08.375
And I'll need yours in turn.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.208
I'll see you soon.

20:51.833 --> 20:55.291
Burying and burning have both
come up for discussion.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.000
Along with
the straight and narrow approach

20:57.000 --> 20:59.958
of contacting
the sheriff's office.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.375
I thought we should
hear from you

21:01.375 --> 21:03.458
before we committed ourselves.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.041
Bury them.

21:09.125 --> 21:11.083
I'm headed into town.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.458
What for?

21:12.458 --> 21:13.833
Tell you
when I get back.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.916
- You can't go alone.
- Fine.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Then send somebody.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.166
You want to tell me
something, Mama?

22:24.416 --> 22:25.875
About what?

22:30.083 --> 22:31.583
About your glioma?

22:34.666 --> 22:35.958
Oh, sweetie.

22:37.541 --> 22:38.791
Who told you?

22:43.458 --> 22:45.708
I'm sorry, Flynne.

22:45.708 --> 22:47.041
I'm so sorry.

22:49.916 --> 22:52.833
They tell you
something like that...

22:52.833 --> 22:54.541
- Mama...
- It sounds silly.

22:54.625 --> 22:58.125
But suddenly, you realize
how precious each day is.

22:59.791 --> 23:02.916
And the idea of stealing
even one second from you,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.375
of... of weighing you down
with sadness,

23:06.375 --> 23:08.458
when I could protect you?

23:08.458 --> 23:10.208
How long?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.125
Six weeks...

23:16.750 --> 23:18.000
...if I'm lucky.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.041
I told the nurse,
if I was lucky,

23:20.125 --> 23:22.958
I wouldn't be here
in the first place, would I?

23:28.333 --> 23:30.208
This new drug, it's...

23:33.541 --> 23:35.125
It's experimental.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.583
We don't know what's in it.

23:39.583 --> 23:41.833
What's the worst
it could do, Flynne?

23:43.333 --> 23:45.291
Kill me a little quicker?

23:49.125 --> 23:50.541
Come on.

23:58.916 --> 24:00.375
Okay.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.458

25:02.458 --> 25:04.666

26:41.208 --> 26:42.958
Fucking A.

27:25.375 --> 27:27.958
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.500
Coffee is on the desk.

27:31.750 --> 27:32.958
Thanks.

27:35.708 --> 27:38.083
I could really use some intel
right about now,

27:38.083 --> 27:39.666
if you got it.

27:41.125 --> 27:43.333
You're not gonna believe me.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.625
Try me.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.916
It ain't a sim.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.791
When I put on the headset,
I'm operating an actual body.

27:59.125 --> 28:01.250
It's some kind of robot,
I guess,

28:01.250 --> 28:03.875
but a whole lot
more realistic than that.

28:03.875 --> 28:05.333
It looks like me.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.000
Feels like me.

28:08.583 --> 28:10.875
Except it's, uh, in London.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.916
This guy says.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.166
I can believe that.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.375
Well, that ain't
the hard part yet.

28:18.625 --> 28:21.166
He says I witnessed something
while I was there.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.583
Something that these folks
are wanting to kill me

28:23.583 --> 28:25.500
to keep quiet.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.958
I still don't see
what's so hard to believe.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.916
It's in the future, Burton.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.666
Where he is.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.041
2100.

28:45.125 --> 28:48.666
I assume he gave you
a reason to believe that?

28:55.750 --> 28:58.750
You check on Mama
on your way up?

29:02.416 --> 29:04.208
Is she okay?

29:04.208 --> 29:05.833
Claims she's fine.

29:05.833 --> 29:08.416
But Leon says her vitals
are out of whack.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.833
Like she's fighting something.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.041
Why?

29:14.708 --> 29:17.375
This guy, he-he gave me
something for her.

29:17.375 --> 29:18.791
A drug.

29:18.875 --> 29:21.916
For her tumor.
He says it will cure her.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.750
Well, fuck that, 'cause we're
not taking his word on anything.

29:23.750 --> 29:25.833
- I gave it to her.
- You what?

29:25.833 --> 29:28.625
- He showed me
her obituary, okay?
- Flynne, you can't

29:28.625 --> 29:30.250
- just give her...
- She's gonna die in four weeks

29:30.250 --> 29:31.458
if we don't do
nothing about it.

29:31.458 --> 29:32.625
And you just believed that?

29:32.625 --> 29:34.541
It was real, Burton.
It felt real.

29:34.625 --> 29:36.625
Felt real?

29:36.625 --> 29:39.875
- Flynne, are you out
of your fucking mind?
- I'll go back.

29:39.875 --> 29:41.875
- I'll get more intel,
if that's what you want.
- No fucking way.

29:41.875 --> 29:43.625
- I'm going in there.
- No.

29:43.625 --> 29:45.000
He doesn't want you.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.625
Okay? He wants me.

29:46.625 --> 29:48.916
I don't give a fuck
who he wants.

29:49.000 --> 29:49.958
That's part of the problem.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.375
You're letting him think
he's in charge.

29:51.375 --> 29:52.916
Goddamn it, Burton.
Why do you have to go

29:53.000 --> 29:55.083
and fuck things up
all the time, huh?

30:02.666 --> 30:04.166
Fuck. Look, I'm sorry.

30:05.208 --> 30:06.333
Okay?

30:11.041 --> 30:13.041
We need you here.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.000
You know that.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.416
What happens when more people
come hunting us down?

30:23.458 --> 30:25.208
But I'm going, Burton.

30:27.375 --> 30:29.208
This ain't a discussion.

30:29.208 --> 30:30.416
Okay?

31:20.291 --> 31:21.500
Welcome back.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.250
Where are we?

31:29.250 --> 31:31.458
The rear garden of a house
in Notting Hill.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.250
It belongs to Lev Zubov.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.666
That's him, in the waistcoat.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.708
Are those...?

31:41.708 --> 31:43.541
Thylacine analogs.

31:43.625 --> 31:44.750
Though I believe
you might call them

31:44.750 --> 31:46.916
- something else.
- Tasmanian tigers.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.333
I saw them on a show once,

31:48.333 --> 31:49.875
but they said that
they were extinct.

31:49.875 --> 31:53.166
Well, one of Lev's hobbies
is recreating such things.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.958
- From their DNA.
- Do they bite?

31:55.958 --> 31:58.875
These two are designed
for domestic companionship.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.166
There's a rival genetic line,
bred to be feral.

32:02.166 --> 32:03.583
So, why are we here?

32:03.583 --> 32:05.958
We're in Notting Hill to meet
with Lev and his two technicals.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.291
More specifically,
we're in his garden

32:07.375 --> 32:08.708
to give you
a moment to acclimate

32:08.708 --> 32:09.791
before we begin.

32:10.958 --> 32:12.625
Begin what?

32:12.625 --> 32:14.041
Debriefing you.

32:15.750 --> 32:17.791
<i>Lev is the man
who hired me to find Aelita.</i>

32:17.875 --> 32:19.125
<i>The woman who went missing.</i>

32:19.125 --> 32:21.125
<i>And what's a technical?</i>

32:21.125 --> 32:24.708
<i>Someone with expertise
in, ah... technical matters?</i>

32:24.708 --> 32:26.125
Gift for words, hasn't he?

32:26.125 --> 32:27.625
<i>Ossian is the gentleman</i>

32:27.625 --> 32:29.916
<i>looming rather threateningly
against the tree.</i>

32:30.000 --> 32:31.750
<i>He has a knack
for that sort of thing,</i>

32:31.750 --> 32:33.250
<i>as you'll soon see.</i>

32:33.250 --> 32:34.625
<i>And Ash is the exceedingly</i>

32:34.625 --> 32:35.750
<i>gloomy-looking young woman</i>

32:35.750 --> 32:37.291
<i>at the table.</i>

32:39.750 --> 32:40.958
<i>They work to maintain
the connection</i>

32:40.958 --> 32:42.333
<i>between our two worlds.</i>

32:42.333 --> 32:44.166
<i>Which is apparently
rather more tenuous</i>

32:44.250 --> 32:46.000
<i>than one might prefer.</i>

32:46.000 --> 32:49.458
Can we bring them in before he
says something we can't unsay?

32:50.916 --> 32:52.291
Lunch is served, Wilf.

32:53.375 --> 32:54.750
You can shut it down.

32:58.250 --> 32:59.375
<i>What happens
to this thing</i>

32:59.375 --> 33:00.875
when I'm not in it?

33:00.875 --> 33:02.708
It has an eight-hour
sleep cycle.

33:02.708 --> 33:04.041
The rest of the time,

33:04.125 --> 33:06.333
when you're off in your stub,
it runs on AI.

33:07.375 --> 33:08.416
My "stub"?

33:14.250 --> 33:17.083
When a party from our present
made contact with the past,

33:17.083 --> 33:18.750
that past immediately
branched off

33:18.750 --> 33:20.625
and formed its own continuum.

33:20.625 --> 33:22.500
Or parallel timeline,
if you will.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.791
Or stub.

33:27.041 --> 33:28.458
In other words,

33:28.458 --> 33:31.916
our two timelines were identical
until that moment of contact.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.416
At that point, they separated.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.666
You're not helping at all.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.125
Any moment
you'd like to jump in.

33:36.125 --> 33:39.208
It can all be rather
confusing, even for us.

33:39.208 --> 33:42.500
Perhaps we should stick to
the most urgent matters at hand,

33:42.500 --> 33:45.041
and trust that the secondary
details will fall into place.

33:45.125 --> 33:48.750
Urgent, like the people coming
to kill me and my family?

33:50.250 --> 33:52.000
For instance.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.333
Or, from our perspective,

33:53.333 --> 33:55.875
urgent being what happened
to Aelita West.

33:55.875 --> 33:58.583
Why is she
so important to y'all?

33:59.791 --> 34:02.791
Aelita worked for an entity
called the Research Institute.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.583
Her duties there gave her
access to your stub.

34:05.583 --> 34:08.791
We've been paying her to provide
us with a trapdoor into it.

34:08.875 --> 34:11.916
Now that she's missing,
we risk losing that connection.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.416
Mm-hmm.

34:15.916 --> 34:18.125
Well, what were you all up to
in my world, then?

34:18.125 --> 34:19.750
- I'm sorry?
- Seems like you're going

34:19.750 --> 34:22.000
to an awful lot of trouble
here to find things out.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.541
Kind of just begs
the question: Why?

34:24.625 --> 34:26.833
You could call it
intellectual curiosity.

34:26.833 --> 34:27.875
Like a game?

34:27.875 --> 34:30.500
Like you're playing a sim?

34:30.500 --> 34:32.541
I suppose that analogy
could be made.

34:32.625 --> 34:35.375
So, we aren't real to y'all?

34:35.375 --> 34:37.083
Are we? Me, my family,

34:37.083 --> 34:38.958
my friends.

34:38.958 --> 34:42.000
Are we real to you?

34:50.250 --> 34:51.958
I'm working on it.

35:33.166 --> 35:34.458
Got a visitor.

35:35.458 --> 35:37.250
Tommy Constantine.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.708
<i>On foot.</i>

35:39.708 --> 35:41.833
- <i>Half a klick up the road.</i>
- Bring the drones in.

35:41.833 --> 35:43.000
Pull back. I'm coming up.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.833
Roger that.

35:44.833 --> 35:47.041
- Carlos, I need you
to cover for me.
- <i>On my way.</i>

35:50.583 --> 35:52.500
- What do I do?
- Just sit and watch.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.791
If she wakes, don't tell her
where I've got to.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.208
I ain't gonna lie
to her, Burton.

35:57.208 --> 35:58.541
I'm not asking you to.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.375
Just tell her I'm walking
the perimeter.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.708
And then try your best
to keep her there.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.375
That drug you gave my mother,

36:06.375 --> 36:08.791
all it's gone and done
is make her sicker.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.666
It will accomplish
what I promised, I assure you.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.000
Give it time.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Which is the one thing
she don't have, ain't it?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.791
According to y'all?

36:15.875 --> 36:18.208
How'd you all get
that information, anyway?

36:18.208 --> 36:20.666
What else do you all have?
You got her obituary.

36:20.750 --> 36:22.375
But... what happens to me?

36:22.375 --> 36:24.708
Well, as we explained before,

36:24.708 --> 36:26.916
when someone from our world
made contact with yours,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.833
- your timeline...
- Yeah, I get it.
That's the whole stub thing.

36:29.833 --> 36:31.833
But what happened to the
Flynne Fisher in your timeline?

36:31.833 --> 36:34.708
I mean, does she get married,
or have any kids?

36:34.708 --> 36:36.250
Or is she still alive?

36:36.250 --> 36:38.666
What about my brother?

36:38.750 --> 36:42.250
There's
information to a certain point.

36:42.250 --> 36:45.125
But after that point, the
records become rather spotty.

36:45.125 --> 36:47.416
What point? Why?

36:47.500 --> 36:50.166
A lot can happen
in 70 years, Ms. Fisher.

36:52.625 --> 36:54.916
- A lot did happen.
- Yeah, but what? Specifically.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.750
I fear we're getting
a little off track here.

36:56.750 --> 36:58.208
What are you all hiding from me?

36:58.208 --> 37:00.041
These are all
excellent questions,

37:00.125 --> 37:01.791
and in time,
they'll all be answered.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.625
- I give you my word.
- Yeah,
you keep on saying that,

37:03.625 --> 37:06.000
but it's just starting to sound
like it don't mean that much.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.208
Ms. Fisher...

37:07.208 --> 37:08.458
When will
my mother get better?

37:08.458 --> 37:09.500
<i>Iesniegt navised maehad.</i>

37:09.500 --> 37:10.666
<i>Urtew cept zoryin.</i>

37:10.750 --> 37:12.083
They can encrypt
their voices

37:12.083 --> 37:13.875
when they address each other.

37:13.875 --> 37:15.000
You'll grow accustomed to it.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.166
Although,
I'm afraid the irritation

37:16.250 --> 37:17.291
never quite dissipates.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.166
I was simply
informing Ash

37:19.250 --> 37:22.541
that the medication in question
has a 57% efficacy rate.

37:22.625 --> 37:23.833
Which means?

37:23.833 --> 37:25.166
The ability to produce

37:25.250 --> 37:26.750
a desired or intended result.

37:26.750 --> 37:28.583
Borrowed from Latin "efficacia."

37:28.583 --> 37:30.500
I know what
the fucking word means.

37:31.958 --> 37:34.333
What does it mean for my mother?

37:34.333 --> 37:37.625
We can't guarantee
that the drug will work.

37:42.541 --> 37:44.041
Well, I'm guessing
"spraying a weed" means

37:44.125 --> 37:46.791
something pretty different
in the future, huh?

37:46.875 --> 37:50.208
Y'all got extinct animals
you've brought back to life,

37:50.208 --> 37:52.916
time travel, moving tattoos...

37:54.083 --> 37:56.416
Seems like it shouldn't be
too hard to help a good woman

37:56.500 --> 37:59.375
who's had a shitty
run of luck lately.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.208
Make that happen...

38:02.958 --> 38:05.375
...and I'll start talking
about your missing lady.

38:07.166 --> 38:09.125
Give you my word on it, too.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.708
You ever come across
anything like this?

38:17.458 --> 38:18.833
You know what?

38:20.041 --> 38:21.708
That's a 6.8 SPC.

38:21.708 --> 38:25.125
We used those
in the war on occasion.

38:26.375 --> 38:27.958
Builder muscle, you think?

38:28.958 --> 38:30.458
Good a guess as any.

38:31.916 --> 38:33.125
All the way out here, though?

38:34.500 --> 38:36.541
That seem a bit odd, don't it?

38:36.625 --> 38:39.500
Whole damn thing seems
pretty odd to me, Tommy.

38:43.458 --> 38:46.291
Hey, you and Flynne ain't mad
at Dee Dee and me, are you?

38:46.375 --> 38:48.416
Why would we be mad?

38:48.500 --> 38:49.791
All them vehicles.

38:53.875 --> 38:56.708
Looks like y'all getting ready
to roast a pig or something.

38:59.791 --> 39:03.250
Just, uh, wondering why
we didn't get an invite.

39:03.250 --> 39:05.875
That's Reece's truck there, right?

39:05.875 --> 39:07.375
And Leon?

39:07.375 --> 39:08.916
Carlos, too?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.875
Yeah, just one of our
stupid drone tournaments.

39:13.166 --> 39:14.583
I didn't figure
you'd be fool enough

39:14.583 --> 39:16.250
to mess around with those.

39:17.583 --> 39:19.166
No.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.416
Suppose not.

39:27.916 --> 39:29.208
Flynne.

39:30.416 --> 39:32.083
Burton.

39:50.708 --> 39:51.875
Fuck.

40:01.750 --> 40:05.916
I know how personally invested
you are here, Wilf.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.208
So I worry that you might feel
an understandable instinct

40:09.208 --> 40:11.083
to push the pace a little
with Ms. Fisher.

40:11.083 --> 40:12.916
I think we should
let her find her feet

40:13.000 --> 40:15.250
before we pressure her too much.

40:15.250 --> 40:18.208
You said time was a resource
we can't afford to waste.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.458
And I wouldn't
consider it wasted

40:19.458 --> 40:21.833
if it were time spent
making her more...

40:21.833 --> 40:23.791
tractable.

40:23.875 --> 40:25.125
My understanding was

40:25.125 --> 40:27.833
that you simply wanted
to speak with Aelita.

40:27.833 --> 40:29.875
It's the only reason I agreed
to arrange an introduction.

40:29.875 --> 40:31.875
Indeed.

40:31.875 --> 40:34.375
And those conversations
led to the possibility

40:34.375 --> 40:36.291
of access to this
young woman's world.

40:36.375 --> 40:37.708
Why did you want access?

40:44.291 --> 40:46.208
Wilf.

40:46.208 --> 40:47.750
You've always struck me

40:47.750 --> 40:50.333
as someone with a gift for
discerning the difference

40:50.333 --> 40:54.416
between good knowledge
and bad knowledge.

40:54.500 --> 40:58.750
Good being that which
brings you power or advantage.

40:58.750 --> 41:03.666
Bad being the type which
might put you in mortal peril.

41:03.750 --> 41:06.333
It's a point of pride.
I don't lie to my friends.

41:06.333 --> 41:09.625
So, please, take some care
of what you ask.

41:09.625 --> 41:11.916
I'd hate to stop
thinking of you as a friend.

41:31.541 --> 41:34.166
Make sure to say hi
to Flynne and your mama for me.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.291
Yeah,
I'll do that, Tommy.

41:48.083 --> 41:49.291
What did he say?

41:51.958 --> 41:54.750
Two abandoned SUVs
up the road a ways.

41:54.750 --> 41:56.750
With some new kind of
cloaking tech.

41:56.750 --> 41:58.041
Which answers that question.

41:59.500 --> 42:00.875
You okay?

42:00.875 --> 42:05.291
I don't
fucking know, Burton.

42:05.375 --> 42:07.875
I mean, how the fuck is all
this happening right now?

42:09.458 --> 42:11.958
There's a pile of dead
bodies back there.

42:11.958 --> 42:13.833
You can't think like that.

42:19.958 --> 42:21.708
Your buddies from the future
gonna help us any?

42:21.708 --> 42:23.000
Or we on our own?

42:25.125 --> 42:26.791
They said they're watching.

42:27.958 --> 42:29.750
I guess they'll try
to give us a warning

42:29.750 --> 42:31.041
before the next wave hits.

42:31.125 --> 42:32.250
How much of a warning?

42:32.250 --> 42:33.875
Much as they can manage.

42:35.666 --> 42:38.291
They said they're
sending money, though.

42:38.375 --> 42:39.708
A lot.

42:39.708 --> 42:41.583
$250,000.

42:45.083 --> 42:46.500
Soon as that hits my account,

42:46.500 --> 42:48.083
I'm gonna lose
my social security.

42:48.083 --> 42:50.291
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry, I told them.

42:50.375 --> 42:51.958
They said they're gonna
figure out a workaround.

42:51.958 --> 42:53.041
Which is?

42:54.375 --> 42:56.500
<i>Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.</i>

42:56.500 --> 42:59.750
I just won the goddamn lottery!

43:06.833 --> 43:08.291
Oh!

43:08.375 --> 43:10.416
I've always been lucky.
You both know that, don't you?

43:10.500 --> 43:12.916
Luck ain't got nothing
to do with it, Leon.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.083
What? You two meet
some folks in the futur...

43:15.083 --> 43:17.166
- Indoor voice, Leon.
- The future?

43:17.250 --> 43:18.375
They help me win the lottery?

43:18.375 --> 43:20.166
How else you gonna
explain that but luck?

43:20.250 --> 43:21.250
Leon.

43:22.291 --> 43:26.083
From Mr. Pickett.
With his congratulations.

43:29.208 --> 43:31.041
Corbell Pickett?
For real?

43:31.125 --> 43:32.583
Mm-hmm. Yep.

43:34.625 --> 43:36.666
Jesus fuckin' Christ.

43:36.750 --> 43:38.083
Just raise your glass.

43:38.083 --> 43:39.250
Nod your thanks.

43:41.791 --> 43:43.791
Manners, Flynne.

43:47.500 --> 43:51.000
I... I just got to...
Got to use the bathroom.

44:02.375 --> 44:04.041
Fucking asshole's
still looking at us.

44:04.125 --> 44:06.458
Well, our idiot cousin
did just win the lottery.

44:06.458 --> 44:09.750
So makes us kind of interesting
for a minute or two.

44:10.958 --> 44:12.708
So, you believe me now?

44:12.708 --> 44:14.041
'Bout this whole future thing?

44:14.125 --> 44:16.833
Step closer, I'll admit.

44:16.833 --> 44:18.666
Not a small one, either.

44:21.750 --> 44:22.916
What's that?

44:23.958 --> 44:25.791
Shopping list
for our little army.

44:27.625 --> 44:29.375
Duty roster.

44:32.041 --> 44:33.250
Where's Conner at?

44:34.583 --> 44:35.750
You know Conner.

44:35.750 --> 44:37.041
I do.

44:37.125 --> 44:39.041
I also know that maybe
asking him to help us

44:39.125 --> 44:40.875
- might count as a good deed.
- Might.

44:40.875 --> 44:42.458
Might also get us all killed.

44:42.458 --> 44:44.458
Come on, Burton.

44:44.458 --> 44:46.583
He came in pretty damn
handy the other night.

44:46.583 --> 44:49.375
We spun the dial,
and thankfully,

44:49.375 --> 44:51.791
Conner came up sober.

44:51.875 --> 44:54.541
Which I guess means
cousin Leon is not the only one

44:54.625 --> 44:56.541
with a bit of luck on his side.

44:59.833 --> 45:01.666
What's up? You got
something you want to say?

45:02.791 --> 45:04.208
Already said it.

45:04.208 --> 45:06.583
I can't go fixing something
that's unfixable, Flynne.

45:07.916 --> 45:09.958
Not in the middle of all this.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.875
All right, then,

45:14.875 --> 45:17.625
- I'm gonna head home.
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

45:17.625 --> 45:19.625
I talked to Reece
about that sim.

45:19.625 --> 45:21.958
How you got us all
out of the barn.

45:21.958 --> 45:24.583
And?

45:24.583 --> 45:27.708
And you let the sheep out 'cause
you felt bad for them, right?

45:27.708 --> 45:30.291
And then, once they were gone,
the tractor was revealed.

45:30.375 --> 45:32.541
So it was like
the sim gave you...

45:33.708 --> 45:35.708
...an empathy bonus?

45:35.708 --> 45:37.416
But tactically,
that would've been

45:37.500 --> 45:39.666
sacrificing a valuable asset.

45:40.666 --> 45:42.208
Those Nazis were about
to storm us,

45:42.208 --> 45:44.166
and the sheep were
the only cover we had.

45:44.250 --> 45:45.625
Okay.

45:45.625 --> 45:47.041
How would you
have found it then?

45:47.125 --> 45:49.125
That's my point.

45:49.125 --> 45:50.875
You feel bad for Conner.

45:50.875 --> 45:52.541
I get it. We all do.

45:52.625 --> 45:55.875
But nobody's handing out any
empathy bonuses here, Flynne.

45:55.875 --> 45:58.833
In the real world, there ain't
gonna be no fucking tractor.

45:58.833 --> 45:59.916
Sure.

46:01.166 --> 46:02.541
But if there were one...

46:04.041 --> 46:06.416
...you wouldn't have found it.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.416
Now would you?

46:12.958 --> 46:14.583
I'll see you at home.

46:36.625 --> 46:38.791
Damn it, Flynne.

47:12.291 --> 47:15.375
<i>...of Entomology
at Cornell University.</i>

47:15.375 --> 47:17.166
<i>Each individual bee</i>

47:17.250 --> 47:20.333
<i>has a significant role
to play serving the larger</i>

47:20.333 --> 47:22.000
<i>needs of the colony.</i>

47:22.000 --> 47:25.833
<i>Workers, the drones, the queen,
they all contribute</i>

47:25.833 --> 47:28.583
<i>to the healthy functioning
of the hive.</i>

47:28.583 --> 47:31.833
<i>And none of them,
not even the queen herself,</i>

47:31.833 --> 47:35.291
<i>can survive without
the support of the others.</i>

47:35.375 --> 47:37.583
<i>However,
despite their cooperative</i>

47:37.583 --> 47:39.625
<i>and highly regimented society,</i>

47:39.625 --> 47:43.541
<i>environmental pressures have
placed the population of bees</i>

47:43.625 --> 47:45.291
<i>into freefall, which has led</i>

47:45.375 --> 47:47.708
<i>to a cascade
of agricultural deficiencies</i>

47:47.708 --> 47:51.041
<i>and economic turmoil
in our own society.</i>

47:51.125 --> 47:54.583
<i>For instance,
a study conducted in California</i>

47:54.583 --> 47:56.625
<i>with almond farmers found that</i>

47:56.625 --> 47:59.125
<i>the absence of bees
decreased their annual income</i>

47:59.125 --> 48:00.791
<i>by $75,000...</i>

48:07.458 --> 48:10.041
You ever worry you might shoot
someone with that thing?

48:10.125 --> 48:11.500
Wake up startled-like?

48:14.958 --> 48:17.500
That why you don't come
and visit so much no more?

48:17.500 --> 48:19.666
Afraid I might beat you
to the draw?

48:21.708 --> 48:23.000
You drunk, Conner?

48:24.041 --> 48:25.083
I'm something.

48:31.125 --> 48:32.416
That's for sure.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.333
You didn't answer
my question, though.

48:42.875 --> 48:45.458
Why don't you come a-visiting?

48:45.458 --> 48:47.041
I'm a-visiting now, ain't I?

48:48.208 --> 48:51.458
Got so I figured I was gonna
find you dead one of these days.

48:51.458 --> 48:53.083
Didn't know if
I could live with that.

48:53.083 --> 48:55.625
So why are you here now?

48:55.625 --> 48:57.666
You disappeared on us,
after our night of mayhem.

48:57.750 --> 48:59.875
The fun seemed
to die down pretty quick.

48:59.875 --> 49:03.000
I've learned I'm not so good
with the quiet periods.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.875
We got
an ongoing situation.

49:06.125 --> 49:08.500
I could use a decent
staff sergeant.

49:12.333 --> 49:14.500
The other night, when I was
headed toward your place?

49:15.875 --> 49:18.333
Those boys,
they heard me coming,

49:18.333 --> 49:20.833
hustled into the brush.

49:20.833 --> 49:24.875
I only saw one of them,
but he had me scoped.

49:26.041 --> 49:28.625
All he had to do
was twitch a finger.

49:28.625 --> 49:29.916
Know what he did?

49:30.958 --> 49:33.333
Just let me roll by.

49:34.541 --> 49:36.375
I figured they was headed
to the Baker place,

49:36.375 --> 49:39.916
that Jasper crossed
Corbell Pickett somehow, and...

49:43.291 --> 49:44.750
I kept thinking on it...

49:46.000 --> 49:47.458
...as I was going up the road.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.083
There's only one reason
I could guess

49:50.083 --> 49:52.250
why that boy would let me by.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.541
It's pity.

49:58.833 --> 50:01.291
More I thought on that,
the madder I got.

50:02.875 --> 50:04.791
I mean, I decided
I was gonna kill that boy,

50:04.875 --> 50:07.125
no matter where he was headed.

50:09.125 --> 50:11.000
By the time I got back,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.625
those fellas had your balls
in a nice tight grip.

50:14.625 --> 50:17.041
Only seemed neighborly
to ease the pressure.

50:18.083 --> 50:21.666
Felt pretty good
for about 12 hours or so.

50:23.375 --> 50:25.541
Almost like I'd made
things right for myself.

50:46.541 --> 50:49.375
How much money
you reckon the VA spends,

50:49.375 --> 50:51.208
trying to put all us
Humpty Dumpties

50:51.208 --> 50:53.916
- back together again?
- Less than it would take.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.916
Turns out they could
just let us all

50:56.000 --> 50:57.166
start shooting each other.

50:57.250 --> 50:59.583
Solve
the whole damn problem,

50:59.583 --> 51:00.583
don't you think?

51:00.583 --> 51:02.791
Half of us'd be dead,

51:02.875 --> 51:04.291
the rest would be happy.

51:05.791 --> 51:07.958
Tell me that firefight
didn't make you happy, Burton.

51:09.333 --> 51:11.000
There it is.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.375
There it most
definitely fucking is,

51:13.375 --> 51:14.458
am I right?

51:14.458 --> 51:16.916
Am I right?

51:34.541 --> 51:36.041
What you got going on out there?

51:36.083 --> 51:38.916
Flynne took a trip
to future London.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.541
Saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

51:41.625 --> 51:45.000
Now people from there
are hiring folks to kill us.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.875
I'm pretty fucked up,
but not that fucked up.

51:50.875 --> 51:52.916
I didn't say
you had to believe me.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.083
You just need to help.
Sober up.

51:55.083 --> 51:57.250
Come camp at our place.

51:57.250 --> 51:59.791
Leon's there for an offload,
if you want it.

51:59.875 --> 52:01.500
It's not
his job no more.

52:03.041 --> 52:06.125
I don't guess he ever saw it
as a job, Conner.

52:06.125 --> 52:07.375
Probably wouldn't be too happy

52:07.375 --> 52:09.083
to hear you describe it
that way, either.

52:09.083 --> 52:12.625
I just told you I killed
some boys for pitying me.

52:12.625 --> 52:14.583
- And?
- You doing the same thing?

52:14.583 --> 52:16.416
I was trying for
empathy, actually.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.125
What's the fucking difference?

52:19.541 --> 52:20.833
Fucked if I know, man.

52:22.791 --> 52:24.958
Look, the offer is there
if you want it.

52:25.958 --> 52:27.833
But the sober part
is nonnegotiable.

52:36.250 --> 52:38.291
You gonna remember me
standing here,

52:38.375 --> 52:40.666
telling you all this,
come morning?

52:43.625 --> 52:44.750
I'd say...

52:47.625 --> 52:49.750
...it's fifty-fifty.

53:29.666 --> 53:32.000
<i>¿No esposa esta noche, Señor?</i>

53:33.333 --> 53:35.958
Flying free this
evening, Manuel.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.750
Perhaps you'd like
<i>una compañera?</i>

53:40.750 --> 53:43.416
Why, you old devil.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.416
What do you take me for?

53:45.500 --> 53:48.291
<i>Un hombre de gran pasión,
¿no?</i>

53:52.875 --> 53:55.666
Well, put it like that? I...

53:55.750 --> 53:58.000
Guess I wouldn't spurn
some company.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.875
Mm.

54:03.250 --> 54:04.250
Ah.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.333
And what is your name, honey?

54:15.916 --> 54:17.000
Carmen.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.916
Ah.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.500
Like the Chiquita lady?

54:22.500 --> 54:24.541
<i>¿Qué es eso?</i>

54:24.625 --> 54:28.208
Used to be a fruit
called the banana.

54:29.625 --> 54:32.166
Killed off in
some sort of fungus.

54:32.250 --> 54:33.625
Terrible shame.

54:35.666 --> 54:38.000
You, uh...

54:38.000 --> 54:39.875
have any talents
I should be aware of?

54:41.041 --> 54:43.500
Would you
excuse us, <i>señorita?</i>

54:52.083 --> 54:53.541
Hey.

54:53.625 --> 54:56.791
You're quite a difficult man
to contact, Mr. Pickett.

54:59.125 --> 55:01.541
Our records indicate
that you are an individual

55:01.625 --> 55:04.833
with some power
and influence in Clanton,

55:04.833 --> 55:06.750
circa 2030.

55:06.750 --> 55:08.416
And it also seems

55:08.500 --> 55:12.416
that you're a man who doesn't
indulge in too many scruples.

55:12.500 --> 55:13.500
Is that correct?

55:14.625 --> 55:17.416
What the fuck is going on here?

55:17.500 --> 55:20.250
We have a situation that
would appear to require

55:20.250 --> 55:22.500
some local knowledge.

55:24.833 --> 55:28.208
We'd like to pay you
ten million dollars

55:28.208 --> 55:30.916
to eliminate two members
of your community.

55:35.375 --> 55:39.500
Who are you? Homeland Security?

55:42.875 --> 55:44.541
You fuckers hacked this thing?

55:45.583 --> 55:47.708
We're prepared to transfer 25%

55:47.708 --> 55:48.791
into your account now,

55:48.875 --> 55:50.708
as a good faith payment.

55:50.708 --> 55:52.833
The rest will be paid
upon completion.

55:54.291 --> 55:56.625
The individuals'
names in question

55:56.625 --> 55:58.666
are Flynne and Burton Fisher.

56:06.166 --> 56:07.666
You think I'm a fool?

56:09.041 --> 56:11.708
This is entrapment, asshole.

56:11.708 --> 56:14.333
Open and shut.

56:14.333 --> 56:15.958
End game!

56:20.083 --> 56:22.083
Jesus Christ.

56:24.083 --> 56:26.083
Fucking idiots.

57:38.916 --> 57:40.583
How was Havana?

57:47.583 --> 57:50.125
Always better when you're there.

57:50.125 --> 57:51.958
Oh, I doubt that.

57:51.958 --> 57:54.416
Bet you get up to all sorts
of trouble on your own.

57:54.500 --> 57:57.250
Some <i>cha-cha-chá?</i>

57:58.541 --> 58:00.791
I'm afraid we might need
to take a break

58:00.875 --> 58:02.791
from the old Tropicana.

58:02.875 --> 58:04.125
How come?

58:16.166 --> 58:17.750
Corbell?

58:31.833 --> 58:34.000
Burton, get up here right now.

59:04.875 --> 59:06.250
Mama?

59:08.208 --> 59:09.875
What are you doing?

59:09.875 --> 59:10.916
You okay?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.333
I was hungry.

59:13.333 --> 59:15.833
I thought I was in a dream.

59:15.833 --> 59:17.583
Mama.

59:19.166 --> 59:20.833
I can see, Flynne.

59:20.833 --> 59:22.208
Mama.

59:22.208 --> 59:24.875
I can see you. I can see you.

1:00:04.125 --> 1:00:07.458
What connection do you have
to a man named Corbell Pickett?

1:00:07.458 --> 1:00:10.291
<i>Now, you won't
get anywhere in life</i>

1:00:10.375 --> 1:00:12.625
if you don't have the courage
to be cruel now and then.

1:00:14.125 --> 1:00:15.791
<i>That's the kind
of person that he is.</i>

1:00:15.875 --> 1:00:17.083
That ain't who we are.

1:00:18.083 --> 1:00:21.875
There ought to be a simpler way
to kill a girl.

1:00:23.375 --> 1:00:26.375
 Aelita left a clue
as to her potential whereabouts.

1:00:26.375 --> 1:00:28.208
She was always fond of riddles.

1:00:29.833 --> 1:00:31.083
Wilf...

1:00:31.083 --> 1:00:32.333
that's my house.

1:00:35.666 --> 1:00:36.958
I've arrived.
