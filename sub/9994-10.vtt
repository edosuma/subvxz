00:00.420 --> 00:03.750
Alison, Al, time to wake up 

00:04.470 --> 00:06.340
Hi there doll face 

00:06.340 --> 00:07.900
You slept through the alarm.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.270
You doing okay?

00:09.300 --> 00:10.900
Middle of the night,you woke me up

00:10.930 --> 00:14.030
and told me you were feeling a little stiff.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.260
Why are you looking to me like that

00:16.260 --> 00:17.750
I don't know

00:17.750 --> 00:21.420
Things just seem different

00:21.420 --> 00:22.960
You seem different.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.140
Different?

00:24.140 --> 00:25.880
What do you mean different?

00:25.910 --> 00:27.580
Look at your face.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.510
Look at my arms!

00:29.540 --> 00:31.010
What are you talking about?

00:31.040 --> 00:32.380
Oh,my God!

00:32.409 --> 00:34.510
I think we're dolls!

00:34.540 --> 00:36.510
We're in the middle of a family crisis.

00:36.540 --> 00:38.410
I need everyone to pull together.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.640
What is it,Mom?

00:39.680 --> 00:40.780
What's the big deal?

00:40.780 --> 00:43.540
Honey,I really think
you're overreacting here.

00:43.580 --> 00:44.910
Overreacting?!

00:44.940 --> 00:46.840
We're dolls!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.480
All of us!

00:48.510 --> 00:51.510
Al,honestly,everything
is as it's always been.

00:51.540 --> 00:53.510
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:53.540 --> 00:57.210
I'm talking about the fact
that you're six inches tall

00:57.240 --> 00:59.510
and your face is made of plastic!

00:59.540 --> 01:01.380
I'm talking about the fact

01:01.410 --> 01:04.540
that if I stripped off all
those doll clothes you're wearing

01:04.580 --> 01:06.440
I'd find a smooth little nub

01:06.480 --> 01:08.280
where your boy parts are supposed to be.

01:08.310 --> 01:10.480
Dad,what's wrong with Mom?

01:10.510 --> 01:11.810
She's just a little...

01:11.840 --> 01:12.940
Nothing!

01:12.980 --> 01:14.840
What is wrong with all of you?!

01:14.880 --> 01:16.640
You act like this is normal.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.340
We're human beings!

01:19.380 --> 01:21.140
We always have been!

01:21.180 --> 01:22.940
We dont live in a dollhouse!

01:22.980 --> 01:24.440
Shh!

01:24.480 --> 01:26.410
Mommy,you better be quiet.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.880
If you make too much noise,he'll hear you.

01:29.910 --> 01:31.180
What do you mean?

01:31.210 --> 01:32.380
Who'll hear me?

01:32.410 --> 01:33.980
Who's "he"?

01:34.010 --> 01:36.240
You know who "he" is.

01:39.110 --> 01:40.840
Ariel!

01:40.880 --> 01:43.510
Joe,we have to do something!

01:43.540 --> 01:44.510
Mommy!

01:44.540 --> 01:45.640
Bridgette!

01:45.680 --> 01:47.840
Joe!

01:47.880 --> 01:49.840
We have to hide,sweetie.

01:49.880 --> 01:50.840
No!

01:50.880 --> 01:52.910
Please!

01:52.940 --> 01:54.080
No,please!

01:54.110 --> 01:56.810
Don't hurt my family!

01:57.840 --> 02:00.140
Hey.

02:00.180 --> 02:03.280
You slept through the alarm.

02:03.310 --> 02:05.660
You doing okay?

02:05.660 --> 02:07.590
Middle of the night,you woke me up,

02:07.590 --> 02:11.240
told me you were feeling a little stiff.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.840
Why are you looking at me like that?

02:15.790 --> 02:16.310
You have,uh...

02:17.340 --> 02:19.080
toilet paper all over your face.

02:19.110 --> 02:20.940
I cut myself.

02:20.980 --> 02:22.410
We're all out of shaving cream.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.780
I was trying to make do.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.480
Ah,poor baby.

02:25.510 --> 02:26.740
I'll get you some.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.010
I was gonna go by the
drugstore this morning anyway.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.080
Thanks

02:31.110 --> 02:32.580
You're a doll.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.030 --> 03:19.910
of your

03:19.910 --> 03:21.910
"that I have longed long to redeliver,

03:21.940 --> 03:24.380
and I pray now that you receive them. "

03:24.410 --> 03:26.540
"No,not I. I never gave you aught. "

03:26.580 --> 03:29.480
"My honored lord,you
know right well you did. "

03:29.510 --> 03:30.640
This play is stupid.

03:32.650 --> 03:35.010
And how am I supposed
to learn this for class

03:35.040 --> 03:36.240
if Bridgette keeps tickling Marie?

03:36.280 --> 03:39.440
Hey,Bridge,Ariel's trying to concentrate.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.620
Stop tickling your sister.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.700
I'm not tickling her.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.830
I'm checking to see if she has chicken pox.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.240
Why would you be doing that?

03:46.280 --> 03:48.140
Well,I had this dream last night

03:48.180 --> 03:51.010
that Marie was all covered in chickenpox.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.710
But it looks like she's okay.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.780
Dad...

03:57.010 --> 03:58.380
Hi,sweetie.

03:58.410 --> 03:59.810
You feeling okay?

03:59.840 --> 04:02.110
<i>I cannot get chicken pox,not now.</i>

04:02.140 --> 04:03.410
I've managed to get through

04:03.440 --> 04:04.640
almost four decades on this planet

04:04.680 --> 04:05.980
without getting chicken pox.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.540
I dodged the bullet when
Ariel and Bridgette had it.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.180
And right now,this month,I'm looking at

04:10.210 --> 04:11.940
an uninterrupted string of 14-hour days...

04:13.280 --> 04:15.610
so that we can make our
deadline on the Haspel project.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.510
I just don't feel like
calling my boss and telling him

04:18.540 --> 04:21.440
I can't pitch in because
I came down with a disease

04:21.480 --> 04:23.210
that's usually associated
with kindergartners.

04:24.310 --> 04:25.380
What is so funny?

04:25.410 --> 04:28.680
Joe,Joe,you silly scientist,you.

04:28.710 --> 04:30.880
You're worried about nothing,literally.

04:30.910 --> 04:33.810
There's a vaccine for chicken pox now.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.110
Marie had it almost six months ago.

04:36.140 --> 04:37.680
There's a vaccine?

04:37.710 --> 04:38.780
Marie had it?

04:38.810 --> 04:40.910
Same time she got her measles shot.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.410
Uh-huh.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.480
Huh.

04:43.510 --> 04:46.380
Oh,wait a second. Wait.

04:46.410 --> 04:50.340
Actually,I think I do see some marks.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.110
Some red spots.

04:52.140 --> 04:55.940
Toilet paperus poxus.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.710
Healed.

04:57.740 --> 04:58.710
Funny.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.680
No!

05:23.710 --> 05:25.980
Please! No!

05:30.210 --> 05:31.980
Excuse me.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.540
Where are your parents?

05:39.710 --> 05:41.740
I'm so cold,Daddy!

05:41.780 --> 05:44.040
I want to get out!

05:44.080 --> 05:46.410
Oliver,don't complain.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.710
This is for your own good.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.710
We don't complain about things
that are good for us,right?

05:55.440 --> 05:56.410
<i>Oliver.</i>

05:56.440 --> 05:58.240
Oliver. Son,I'm ready to go.

05:59.780 --> 06:01.580
Why are you just standing there?

06:01.610 --> 06:03.410
Come on. Come here.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.410
Kids.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.440
They didn't have it.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.480
We got to go somewhere else.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.910
You look good,Daddy.

06:38.380 --> 06:41.010
I know you've been sick,but
it doesn't really show.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.140
I mean...

06:43.180 --> 06:45.910
you lost some weight and you look good.

06:45.940 --> 06:48.910
That's not why you're here.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.510
You want the truth?

06:50.540 --> 06:53.940
You want the awful truth?

06:53.980 --> 06:56.680
It had nothing to do with you.

06:56.710 --> 07:00.510
And it's killing Mom that
you take this on every year,

07:00.540 --> 07:02.440
that you wear it like...

07:02.480 --> 07:04.980
like a coat of shame.

07:05.010 --> 07:07.580
All she wants to do is
talk and cry and laugh

07:07.610 --> 07:11.110
and look at pictures,and all you want to do

07:11.140 --> 07:13.780
is climb into your own darkness by yourself.

07:14.860 --> 07:17.240
Two years of college...

07:17.280 --> 07:19.110
now you know everything.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.410
20 years of you.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.440
And,yeah,I do know everything.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.680
I'm sorry to interrupt,sir,

07:25.710 --> 07:26.910
but if you don't leave now,

07:26.940 --> 07:28.740
you're going to be late for court.

07:35.310 --> 07:37.210
What did your boss say?

07:37.240 --> 07:38.480
I told you.

07:38.510 --> 07:39.610
I couldn't get to him.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.010
He was behind closed doors

07:41.040 --> 07:42.640
and then he was in court all day.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.940
Had Scanlon run the plates.

07:44.980 --> 07:46.280
There was nothing there.

07:46.310 --> 07:48.840
I assume he has a name,though.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.640
Michael Levitt.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.140
Never been arrested.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.410
Child Protective Services has
never been called to his house.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.680
Are you even listening to me?

07:55.710 --> 07:57.310
I knew it. Look at this.

07:57.340 --> 07:58.910
I knew I'd read this somewhere. What?

07:58.940 --> 08:00.810
Even if you've been... even
if you've been vaccinated,

08:00.840 --> 08:03.040
there's still a one-in-ten
chance of getting chicken pox.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.840
And if you get it,you're contagious.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.080
Who's the silly scientist now?

08:06.110 --> 08:07.250
Well,congratulations.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.740
So what are we gonna
do,put Marie in quarantine

08:09.780 --> 08:10.880
until your project's over?

08:10.910 --> 08:13.010
Is there a reasonably
priced facility nearby?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.410
You okay over there?

08:25.440 --> 08:28.740
I need to visit Arianna next week.

08:28.780 --> 08:30.780
I need to.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.440
Okay.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.309
I don't know if I can make that work.

08:41.340 --> 08:42.480
I have court.

08:42.510 --> 08:43.679
There are motions pending.

08:43.710 --> 08:46.580
You're her father.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.780
Don't you want to see her?

08:48.810 --> 08:50.780
Don't you need to be near her?

08:55.280 --> 08:57.240
Well,I do.

09:01.510 --> 09:04.540
It's been six years.

09:04.580 --> 09:07.910
I want to go visit my daughter's grave.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.240
Shh! He'll hear you.

09:17.210 --> 09:19.940
Shh!

09:21.980 --> 09:24.140
Oliver...

09:24.180 --> 09:28.140
you were supposed to be asleep an hour ago.

09:28.180 --> 09:31.340
You know the rules about bedtime.

09:31.380 --> 09:33.910
And you know what happens
when you break them.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.340
You get one minute.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.340
No,Daddy.

09:36.380 --> 09:37.340
I'm sorry.

09:37.380 --> 09:38.980
I wasn't tired.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.010
Then you lay there until you get tired.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.110
You don't sit up talking to Maggie.

09:43.140 --> 09:44.410
Now,give her to me.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.480
But I like her.

09:46.510 --> 09:48.340
It's a girl's toy,Oliver.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.910
Now,give her to me.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.040
Hello.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.540
Allison,it's Lee Scanlon.

10:06.580 --> 10:07.640
Sorry to wake you.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.640
No,no.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.880
I'm glad you called,actually.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.610
I wanted to talk to you about the man

10:12.640 --> 10:15.040
we were checking into yesterday
- Michael Levitt.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.640
Funny. That's who I'm calling about.

10:16.680 --> 10:20.080
Oh,no.

10:20.110 --> 10:21.210
Am I too late?

10:21.240 --> 10:22.780
What is it? What happened?

10:22.810 --> 10:24.210
Is the little boy all right?

10:24.240 --> 10:27.080
Well,if you call losing your
father to a tragic accident

10:36.210 --> 10:38.020
....

10:38.020 --> 10:40.750
sometime before dawn.

10:41.870 --> 10:44.350
She couldn't get back
down and she was crying.

10:44.450 --> 10:47.120
It was about 6:00 in the morning.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.740
Michael was trying to get her down...

10:49.740 --> 10:52.640
...when he fell off the ladder.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.810
Uh,Ms. Levitt,this is Allison Dubois.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.120
She's here as a representative

10:59.150 --> 11:00.490
of the District Attorney's office.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.850
Allison,this is Sarah Jane Levitt.

11:01.890 --> 11:05.250
This is the woman who made
the 911 call this morning.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.490
I'm so sorry for your loss.

11:06.520 --> 11:09.250
Thank you.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.750
I was,um,back in the kitchen

11:13.790 --> 11:18.350
making coffee when I heard... the scream.

11:18.350 --> 11:28.470
I ran out to the patio,and
he was just lying there.

11:28.470 --> 11:31.290
Sorry.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.190
What about your son?

11:33.220 --> 11:35.590
Is there any chance he
might have witnessed it?

11:35.620 --> 11:37.580
Oliver's not my son.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.290
He's,he's my nephew.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.290
I'm just visiting here

11:41.320 --> 11:44.120
for a few days.

11:44.150 --> 11:47.700
Oliver...

11:47.700 --> 11:49.120
didn't see anything,thank God.

11:49.120 --> 11:53.430
He was asleep in his room when it happened.

11:53.430 --> 11:55.890
He doesn't even know his father's gone yet.

11:55.930 --> 11:57.990
I told him to wait in the playroom...

11:58.030 --> 11:59.030
Shh! Quiet.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.790
...until,uh,we're done here.

12:01.830 --> 12:04.490
Shh! I'm not looking forward to telling him.

12:05.790 --> 12:08.660
Shh! He'll hear you.

12:08.690 --> 12:10.160
Forgive me.

12:10.190 --> 12:12.360
Is there a restroom I could use?

12:12.390 --> 12:14.460
What are you talking about?

12:14.490 --> 12:16.260
Now we can play with each other.

12:16.290 --> 12:19.660
Now there's no one to get mad at us,Oliver.

12:19.690 --> 12:22.660
But I don't feel like playing right now.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.460
Oliver?

12:26.490 --> 12:27.960
Are you alone?

12:32.660 --> 12:35.130
I thought I heard talking.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.060
Voices.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.890
Are you all by yourself?

12:39.930 --> 12:41.890
My dad's dead,isn't he?

12:43.690 --> 12:47.390
My aunt Sarah Jane told
me he had an accident,

12:47.430 --> 12:48.430
but I think he's dead.

12:48.460 --> 12:49.430
Oliver?

12:51.790 --> 12:53.760
Hello.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.230
Again.

12:55.260 --> 12:59.390
Um... I take it you found what you needed.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.590
Yeah,I'm sorry. I just heard Oliver.

13:01.630 --> 13:03.660
I poked my head in to
make sure he was all right.

13:03.690 --> 13:05.690
I'm,um- I'm all finished

13:05.730 --> 13:08.760
with the,with the police
and the ambulance people now,

13:08.790 --> 13:10.760
so come on,sweetie.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.290
Ooh!

13:13.330 --> 13:14.760
Let's show this nice lady out,

13:14.790 --> 13:16.390
and then we'll go down to the kitchen

13:16.430 --> 13:18.460
and then we'll be able to talk a little bit.

13:18.490 --> 13:20.490
Okay? Okay.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.530
Lily.

13:22.560 --> 13:23.530
It's me.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.960
Made it all the way to work

13:24.990 --> 13:27.290
and I realized I forgot my damn pills again.

13:27.330 --> 13:28.290
Here they are.

13:28.330 --> 13:31.660
You must be Manuel.

13:31.690 --> 13:35.190
I've heard a great deal about you.

13:35.230 --> 13:37.160
I'm sorry. You,you are...?

13:37.190 --> 13:38.630
Franklin,will this do?

13:42.390 --> 13:43.360
Manny.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.490
Dr. Franklin Gates.

13:45.530 --> 13:48.030
I'm with the University of New Mexico.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.460
I'm Manuel Devalos and this is my wife Lily,

13:50.490 --> 13:52.760
but then,you seem to know that.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.790
I'm so sorry,Manny.

13:53.830 --> 13:55.460
I didn't want it to go like this.

13:55.490 --> 13:56.460
It's all right,Lily.

13:56.490 --> 13:58.990
Everything happens for a reason.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.660
Even forgetting one's pills

14:00.690 --> 14:02.460
may not necessarily be the random event

14:02.490 --> 14:03.930
it appears. Okay.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.030
Forgive me,I don't mean to be rude,

14:06.060 --> 14:09.160
but I'm still unclear as just to who you are

14:09.190 --> 14:10.590
and what you're doing in my home.

14:10.630 --> 14:12.230
I gather you're a doctor of some sort.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.690
Exactly who and what are you here to treat?

14:14.730 --> 14:16.830
I'm a doctor of philosophy.

14:16.860 --> 14:19.930
I also have some experience
working as a conduit

14:19.960 --> 14:21.630
between the living and the dead.

14:21.660 --> 14:22.760
Your wife contacted me

14:22.790 --> 14:25.830
and asked if I might be interested

14:25.860 --> 14:27.560
in helping her communicate

14:27.590 --> 14:29.090
with your daughter.

14:29.130 --> 14:30.990
Manuel.

14:31.030 --> 14:31.990
I beg of you.

14:32.030 --> 14:33.530
I know how silly this sounds,

14:33.560 --> 14:36.190
and I know how much it pains
you to even think about it,

14:36.230 --> 14:38.830
but...

14:38.860 --> 14:42.390
I must say,our other sessions
have been quite remarkable.

14:46.990 --> 14:49.030
We were just putting together a few things

14:49.060 --> 14:51.290
that Lily felt were
special to your daughter.

14:57.460 --> 14:58.460
White zinnias.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.390
Franklin brought them.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.030
Wasn't that thoughtful?

15:04.490 --> 15:06.790
I told him they were her favorites.

15:10.330 --> 15:12.440
They're not real.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.710
Of course not.It's
too early for zinnias.

15:17.830 --> 15:19.830
She's here...

15:20.860 --> 15:23.630
and she'd really like you to stay.

15:23.660 --> 15:27.130
Are you referring to my daughter?

15:27.160 --> 15:30.190
Of course I am.

15:30.230 --> 15:34.190
Please.

15:34.230 --> 15:36.490
How much do you charge for this...

15:36.530 --> 15:39.760
sort of... blasphemy?

15:39.790 --> 15:40.760
Excuse me?

15:40.790 --> 15:41.890
What's your fee schedule?

15:41.930 --> 15:44.830
I don't charge a fee.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.190
You do this out of the
kindness of your heart?

15:47.230 --> 15:50.430
Your wife has agreed to an honorarium.

15:50.460 --> 15:55.430
$300 an hour,although
that's half what I usually...

15:55.460 --> 15:58.260
Lily,honey,this man is
as phony as these flowers.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.330
Manny...

15:59.360 --> 16:00.330
Lily.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.160
Our daughter is not coming back

16:05.190 --> 16:07.390
for a pleasant chat about the ribbon she won

16:07.430 --> 16:10.130
on Sports Night in tenth grade.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.760
Our daughter died with her heart

16:12.790 --> 16:15.560
full of despair,sitting
in a running automobile

16:15.590 --> 16:17.830
in a locked garage in upstate New York

16:17.860 --> 16:19.630
on a freezing winter night.

16:20.630 --> 16:25.430
She tried calling you... twice.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.860
She tried calling me six times.

16:28.860 --> 16:31.260
She didn't leave a note.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.790
This is beautiful.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.190
Did my wife mention to you

16:39.230 --> 16:42.060
that I am the District
Attorney of the city of Phoenix?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.230
She mentioned you worked in government.

16:45.260 --> 16:47.690
You leave now and you lose my phone number.

16:47.730 --> 16:48.860
I won't press charges.

16:48.890 --> 16:50.660
If you're still standing
there in 30 seconds,

16:50.690 --> 16:53.360
the deal is off.

16:58.390 --> 17:00.330
I miss Daddy.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.890
Bridge,don't be silly.

17:01.930 --> 17:03.130
Daddy's just working late.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.089
He'll be here when you wake up tomorrow.

17:05.130 --> 17:06.760
Hmm.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.230
How about I give you two
kisses to pick up the slack?

17:09.260 --> 17:10.930
Hmm?

17:12.359 --> 17:14.260
That's one.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.890
That's two.

17:16.930 --> 17:18.190
Hey,are you trying to steal

17:18.230 --> 17:20.160
my kissing duties?

17:20.190 --> 17:22.490
Man works late one night,

17:22.530 --> 17:23.930
and then when his back is turned,

17:23.960 --> 17:25.829
his wife tries to steal his kissing duties.

17:25.859 --> 17:28.830
Hmm... my humblest apologies.

17:28.860 --> 17:29.930
Shan't happen again.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.030
Yeah,it better not.

17:33.130 --> 17:35.130
Is Daddy home?

17:35.160 --> 17:36.390
He sure is.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.390
Lucky you woke up.

17:37.430 --> 17:39.730
You almost missed your good night kiss.

17:42.790 --> 17:44.960
Hi,sweetie.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.160
What are you doing? Nothing.

17:49.190 --> 17:51.390
Checking. Checking what?

17:51.430 --> 17:52.630
Checking nothing.

17:52.660 --> 17:53.630
Give her a kiss.

17:53.660 --> 17:54.930
She wants a kiss.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.290
Kiss,Daddy.

17:56.330 --> 17:57.290
Aw...

17:57.330 --> 18:00.460
Come here,little one.

18:00.490 --> 18:01.460
Ugh!

18:02.490 --> 18:03.590
You're strangling me.

18:03.630 --> 18:06.290
My neck.

18:06.330 --> 18:08.960
Night,ladies.

18:08.990 --> 18:11.890
Ain't he something?

18:28.790 --> 18:32.830
That was hard for me,Oliver.

18:32.860 --> 18:35.630
It's hard for everyone when
you don't follow the rules.

18:49.590 --> 18:51.760
There you go.

18:58.490 --> 19:01.460
I'm going to try and put this behind us.

19:01.490 --> 19:05.060
I think you should do the same.

19:05.090 --> 19:07.560
Just stay in bed and go to sleep.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.830
He'll never stop,Oliver.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.460
You know that.

19:24.490 --> 19:25.830
Shh!

19:25.860 --> 19:28.090
I have to go to sleep.

19:28.130 --> 19:29.560
You know he won't stop.

19:29.590 --> 19:30.960
Not until he kills you...

19:30.990 --> 19:33.690
or you kill him.

19:33.730 --> 19:35.160
What are you talking about?

19:35.190 --> 19:36.630
I wouldn't do that.

19:36.660 --> 19:38.460
I couldn't do that.

19:38.490 --> 19:41.260
Oh,I'll bet you could.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.730
Ugh.

19:48.090 --> 19:51.470
??????

19:51.880 --> 19:54.020
About your suspicion

19:54.020 --> 19:58.740
that a homicidal doll helped
a six-year-old,65-pound boy

19:58.740 --> 20:00.440
kill a full-grown adult male?

20:00.470 --> 20:02.740
I'd say that's an absolutely
prudent course of action.

20:02.770 --> 20:04.340
Okay,forget about the doll.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.240
Leave the doll out of this.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.140
Imagine for a second that

20:08.170 --> 20:09.770
that little boy did pull the ladder away

20:09.800 --> 20:11.500
from underneath his father.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.540
Can you blame him?

20:13.570 --> 20:14.770
You know what?

20:14.800 --> 20:17.870
I'm not in a position to blame him or not.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.270
And neither are you.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.370
I mean we don't even know for a fact

20:21.400 --> 20:23.600
that his father was abusing him.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.270
Just like you don't know for a fact

20:25.300 --> 20:28.000
that the little kid had anything
to do with his father's death.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.670
I mean didn't you say

20:29.700 --> 20:32.170
that the police had already
declared the death accidental?

20:32.200 --> 20:33.900
So what's your point?

20:33.940 --> 20:36.370
My point is the reason not
to discuss this with your boss

20:36.400 --> 20:38.140
is because there isn't anything
really worth discussing,

20:38.170 --> 20:39.470
not because you think

20:39.500 --> 20:41.440
the little boy might have
been actually justified

20:41.470 --> 20:44.270
in taking his father's life.

20:44.300 --> 20:48.370
I mean,you're the judge and jury now?

20:48.400 --> 20:51.400
That can't really be what you meant.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.600
I don't know.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.870
I don't know what I meant.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.770
Besides it's like you said.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.440
There's nothing to discuss.

20:57.470 --> 20:58.970
The man's death was an accident.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.800
Where you going?

21:00.800 --> 21:02.110
To bed. I...

21:02.110 --> 21:04.430
I just made the coffee.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.980
Wait a second.

21:06.980 --> 21:09.240
I need you to feel my head.

21:09.270 --> 21:10.870
Well,you're fine.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.300
<i>I need to ask you something,</i>

21:12.340 --> 21:15.840
but I'm afraid it might sound a bit...

21:15.870 --> 21:17.100
abstract.

21:17.140 --> 21:19.970
Okay.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.500
Do you sense...

21:22.540 --> 21:25.670
any kind of energy in this room?

21:25.700 --> 21:28.470
A presence of any kind?

21:28.500 --> 21:31.900
Are you asking me if your office is haunted?

21:35.970 --> 21:39.540
About two and a half years
before you started working here,

21:39.570 --> 21:41.970
my daughter took her own life.

21:43.170 --> 21:46.500
She was 20 at the time.

21:48.900 --> 21:52.700
Every year around this time,I...

21:54.970 --> 21:58.140
Two days ago she was sitting
right where you are now.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.340
I'm sorry. I don't see anything.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.700
I don't feel anything.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.400
Of course not.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.970
The truth is there's
nothing she could really say.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.600
I mean when a child kills themselves

22:19.640 --> 22:21.040
they really do get the last word.

22:21.070 --> 22:22.800
That's sorta the point,isn't it?

22:22.840 --> 22:23.760
Don't blame yourself.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.700
She wouldn't want you to do that.

22:26.740 --> 22:30.070
Who,who can I blame?

22:31.340 --> 22:34.470
It's kind of a baseline
requirement of a parent

22:34.500 --> 22:36.570
that their child survive,isn't it?

22:36.600 --> 22:39.700
You have no way of knowing
what she was thinking,

22:39.740 --> 22:41.000
what she was feeling.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.030
That's funny you should mention that

22:46.030 --> 22:49.370
because I just discovered yesterday

22:49.400 --> 22:53.200
that my wife has been working
for some time with a man

22:53.240 --> 22:55.470
who claims he can see the dead.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.300
He can communicate with the dead.

22:57.340 --> 22:58.470
He's a charlatan.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.500
It enraged me.

23:00.540 --> 23:03.980
And I realized,here I am working

23:03.980 --> 23:07.740
with the genuine article
for almost three years now.

23:07.770 --> 23:10.770
Never once did I tell you about Arianna.

23:10.800 --> 23:14.870
And never once did I ask
if you could reach her.

23:14.900 --> 23:18.540
Not much of a father.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.440
I didn't...

23:29.470 --> 23:30.570
I didn't realize

23:30.600 --> 23:32.940
I was saying anything worth jotting down.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.400
"Last gasp. " Does that
mean anything to you?

23:46.440 --> 23:48.770
"Last gasp?"

23:48.800 --> 23:51.170
What is that?

23:51.200 --> 23:52.470
No.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.570
Doesn't mean a thing to me.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.340
I gotta go.

23:57.370 --> 23:58.670
Don't ask.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.270
Sorry,but I just gotta cut out.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.900
A.J.'s been really patient this week,

24:01.940 --> 24:04.440
but he's officially
reached the saturation point

24:04.470 --> 24:07.100
when it comes to spending
days at this dad's office.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.840
Uh,the good news is Tracy'll
be back in town tomorrow

24:09.870 --> 24:12.370
and I promise I'll be
good for some late nights.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.500
Okay,then.

24:13.540 --> 24:14.380
Joe,you okay?

24:14.380 --> 24:15.370
Yeah,I'm fine.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.600
Don't worry about it. I'll see you tomorrow.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.040
Okay.

24:31.230 --> 24:33.320
That you,darling?

24:33.320 --> 24:35.910
What are you doing out of bed?

24:35.910 --> 24:37.700
I'll be in to give you kisses

24:37.740 --> 24:40.140
and hugs and touches in a bit.

24:40.170 --> 24:43.500
I said back to bed,honey.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.300
Whatever you say,Daddy.

25:08.190 --> 25:10.370
it`s done

25:16.570 --> 25:18.120
I know it sounds bizarre.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.400
That point is not lost on me.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.640
So there's this killer doll...

25:21.670 --> 25:23.040
I didn't say that!

25:23.070 --> 25:26.100
What I'm saying is I saw
another child kill her father.

25:26.140 --> 25:28.370
And it seemed the doll...

25:28.400 --> 25:30.840
seemed to be mastermind.

25:30.870 --> 25:33.270
Even made it look like a
mishap,like the Levitt killing.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.600
The Levitt accident?

25:35.770 --> 25:37.600
The mastermind. Cool.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.300
Any sense of where this may have happened?

25:39.340 --> 25:41.170
I can send some men down to the mall.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.440
We can round up some Kens,some
Barbies,some Cabbage Patches.

25:43.470 --> 25:45.400
One of those little bastards
is bound to know something.

25:46.970 --> 25:48.070
What?

25:48.100 --> 25:49.740
You're not gonna help me,are you?

25:49.770 --> 25:50.740
With what?

25:50.770 --> 25:52.270
Fine. I'll do it myself!

25:52.300 --> 25:53.300
Be careful.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.100
That Raggedy Ann may look out of shape,

25:55.140 --> 25:57.140
but she'll kick your ass in a fight.

26:04.670 --> 26:06.000
Hello.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.540
Ms. Levitt,Allison Dubois

26:08.570 --> 26:09.600
with the District Attorney's office.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.140
We met the morning of the accident.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.300
I just wanted to pay my respects

26:13.340 --> 26:15.800
and see how you and Oliver were doing.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.300
Okay.

26:20.340 --> 26:21.540
Thank you.

26:21.570 --> 26:24.300
Um...

26:24.340 --> 26:25.770
Make yourself at home.

26:28.530 --> 26:31.240
If you'll just excuse me,I
have something I need to do.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.340
Hello,Oliver.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.700
Sorry about your father.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.700
No,you're not.

27:03.270 --> 27:05.240
Who's your friend?

27:05.270 --> 27:06.570
It's not a friend.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.540
It's just a doll.

27:08.570 --> 27:10.070
Really?

27:10.100 --> 27:14.570
Well,when I was young,my
dolls were like friends to me.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.340
I would talk to them.

27:16.370 --> 27:18.440
Tell them things.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.170
Things I couldn't tell anybody else.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.340
Secrets and things.

27:26.540 --> 27:27.740
Do you ever do that?

27:28.770 --> 27:30.400
Maybe.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.370
Sometimes.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.370
So what kind of things do you tell her?

27:38.300 --> 27:40.340
Things about your father?

27:42.370 --> 27:45.440
You think it wasn't an accident,don't you?

27:49.340 --> 27:50.240
I don't know.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.060
What do you think?

27:52.060 --> 27:54.430
You can tell me the truth,Oliver.

27:54.430 --> 27:56.500
I really wanna help you.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.440
Oliver.

28:01.210 --> 28:02.840
Your mommy's on the phone,sweetie.

28:02.870 --> 28:04.270
She really wants to talk to you.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.470
Come on.

28:35.670 --> 28:38.640
*

28:56.640 --> 28:59.070
Mom's home!

28:59.100 --> 29:01.770
Pizza,guys! Come and get it.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.140
Come on!

29:13.100 --> 29:15.370
Can I talk to you?

29:15.400 --> 29:18.470
Can I show you something?

29:18.500 --> 29:19.800
No.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.710
There's really nothing to talk about.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.310
I'm visiting my daughter

29:24.310 --> 29:26.040
and you have your work.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.920
What else is there to say?

29:27.920 --> 29:30.570
I'd like to go with you.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.840
I'd like to try to get a
seat on that plane tomorrow.

29:32.840 --> 29:38.250
I just... before we visit
our daughter's grave,I...

29:38.250 --> 29:46.370
I'd love you to take a
little road trip with me.

29:46.370 --> 29:47.290
2:20 in the morning.

29:47.290 --> 29:49.100
I tell you. This ought to be illegal.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.970
I got it.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.540
Yeah.

29:52.570 --> 29:55.200
May I please talk to your wife?

29:57.040 --> 29:59.000
It's a kid.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.280
Who is this?

30:02.870 --> 30:04.150
How old are you?

30:04.150 --> 30:05.500
Do you know what time it is?

30:05.500 --> 30:07.920
It's 20 minutes after 2:00.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.040
Will you hand the phone to your wife,please?

30:10.040 --> 30:12.910
No,no,as a matter of fact,I will not.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.900
It's the middle of the
night,and she's in bed,

30:14.900 --> 30:17.750
which is where somebody
your age ought to be.

30:18.130 --> 30:20.660
Now,if you call here again,I'm
contacting your parents.

30:20.660 --> 30:23.480
Trust me: you'll wish you'd never been born.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.300
What did he say?

30:27.340 --> 30:28.770
I don't know.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.340
He said he wanted to talk to you,uh.

30:40.570 --> 30:42.640
Yes?

30:42.670 --> 30:44.670
I really don't have any parents.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.930
And I already wish I'd never been born.

30:46.930 --> 30:51.270
So,if you don't mind,may I
please speak with your wife?

30:55.170 --> 30:56.600
Hello?

30:56.600 --> 30:58.850
Do you have my doll?

31:02.210 --> 31:05.030
Oliver,it's the middle of the night.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.650
I couldn't sleep without Maggie.

31:07.650 --> 31:12.070
Okay,all right,I'll bring it right over.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.600
You'll bring what right over?

31:13.600 --> 31:17.760
I have to run a quick errand.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.900
At 2:00 in the morning?

31:28.710 --> 31:31.370
Don't you want to know why I took it?

31:31.370 --> 31:34.130
No. I already know why you took it.

31:34.130 --> 31:35.560
Oliver?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.600
Oliver,who's at the door?

31:37.600 --> 31:38.470
What's going on?

31:38.470 --> 31:40.140
Mrs. Levitt,

31:40.170 --> 31:42.300
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

31:42.340 --> 31:44.640
I... Somehow your nephew's doll got...

31:44.640 --> 31:47.900
I was playing a game,and
I hid it in her bag,

31:47.900 --> 31:50.980
and I forgot to bring it
back before she left today.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.610
I looked her up in the phone book

31:52.610 --> 31:54.470
and asked her to bring it back to me.

31:54.500 --> 31:57.450
Oh,my God. And she did.

31:57.450 --> 31:59.270
Oliver,it's the middle of the night.

31:59.270 --> 32:01.270
No,no,no,no. Please. It's okay.

32:01.270 --> 32:04.830
Really. You-You two have
been through a lot lately.

32:04.870 --> 32:07.200
Sounded like he really needed the doll.

32:07.230 --> 32:10.150
You're a very perceptive person,Mrs...

32:10.150 --> 32:11.460
Dubois.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.330
And if you'll forgive me,

32:13.330 --> 32:16.530
Mr. Dubois and the three
little Dubois are at home

32:16.570 --> 32:18.570
waiting for me,so...

32:30.380 --> 32:31.540
Was he excited

32:31.540 --> 32:33.930
when you slid down the chimney with his toy?

32:33.930 --> 32:36.200
Actually,he was waiting for me.

32:36.230 --> 32:39.430
Well,then,I guess he was excited.

32:39.470 --> 32:42.530
Oh,maybe,or maybe he has a
little bit of what I have.

32:44.970 --> 32:47.830
Oliver Levitt is psychic.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.000
What do you mean?

32:50.030 --> 32:53.900
Well,I mean,I'm a freak,but
I'm not that big of a freak.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.100
There are other people out there

32:56.130 --> 32:58.100
who feel things,see things.

32:58.130 --> 32:59.730
Especially children.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.670
A lot of people believe.

33:01.700 --> 33:03.300
All children start with it,

33:03.330 --> 33:05.570
and they lose it when they start to...

33:05.600 --> 33:09.200
talk and start to read.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.400
That boy definitely has it.

33:14.430 --> 33:17.430
He knew I was at the front
door before I got there.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.070
He knew I didn't think

33:21.100 --> 33:24.130
his father's death was an accident.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.800
He knew I took his doll.

33:25.830 --> 33:27.100
Okay,

33:27.130 --> 33:29.370
but none of that makes him a murderer.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.600
None of that makes his doll evil.

33:32.630 --> 33:34.370
None of that proves

33:34.400 --> 33:36.800
his father didn't actually fall off a ladder

33:36.830 --> 33:38.830
trying to get a cat off a roof.

33:38.870 --> 33:40.630
No fair.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.200
It's the middle of the night.

33:42.230 --> 33:44.370
You can't attack me with logic.

33:45.930 --> 33:47.670
Sorry,baby. I'm tired,

33:47.700 --> 33:49.730
and this is war.

33:49.770 --> 33:51.770
Hmm.

33:54.870 --> 33:56.900
Good night,sweetheart.

34:11.070 --> 34:15.500
It happened again.

34:15.530 --> 34:18.070
It happened again. It happened again.

34:18.100 --> 34:20.170
We have to get rid of him.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.699
I can't.

34:21.730 --> 34:23.070
Sure,you can.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.199
No,I can't. I can't do it.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.900
Well,why not?

34:26.929 --> 34:29.270
Because... because he's my father.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.699
He's so much bigger than me.

34:34.300 --> 34:37.800
Sarah Jane,didn't I tell you to go to sleep?

34:39.100 --> 34:40.400
Sarah Jane?

34:45.670 --> 34:47.900
Sarah Jane Levitt.

34:47.929 --> 34:50.530
Oliver's aunt- it was her doll.

34:54.130 --> 34:56.610
I think the car is here.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.800
Well,hello.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.240
I seem to have got you at a bad time.

35:01.270 --> 35:04.200
We were just getting ready to
go back home to San Francisco.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.520
There's a lot to do.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.950
You know,getting Oliver into school,and...

35:08.640 --> 35:10.770
...starting the formal adoption,

35:10.770 --> 35:12.390
and dealing with his mom.

35:12.390 --> 35:14.440
He's been through so much.

35:14.470 --> 35:15.940
Mm-hmm.

35:16.880 --> 35:20.640
Oh,by the way,thank you again
for returning Oliver's doll.

35:20.670 --> 35:22.100
It meant the world to him.

35:22.140 --> 35:23.050
Oh.

35:23.050 --> 35:26.380
I couldn't help but
notice,it's a rather old doll.

35:26.380 --> 35:31.610
Well,actually,it belonged to
me when I was a little child.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.700
I used to confide in it,tell it things.

35:34.700 --> 35:38.280
About a year ago,I sensed that
Oliver had a lot on his mind,

35:38.280 --> 35:40.500
and,uh,it made his father angry,

35:40.540 --> 35:44.140
but I thought he might take
some comfort in talking to her,

35:44.170 --> 35:48.100
letting her keep his secrets.

35:48.140 --> 35:51.270
I'm sorry. Was there something specific?

35:51.300 --> 35:53.640
Something you need from me?

35:53.670 --> 35:56.300
I just wanted to tell you...

35:58.370 --> 36:00.300
you're going to get away with it.

36:02.170 --> 36:03.200
Nobody senses.

36:05.670 --> 36:07.670
Nobody cares.

36:18.270 --> 36:20.500
I have no idea what you're talking about.

36:20.540 --> 36:23.670
Really? That's funny,'cause
I did a little research,

36:24.290 --> 36:26.070
and it seems

36:26.070 --> 36:27.770
tragic accidents

36:27.770 --> 36:31.090
kind of follow you wherever you go.

36:31.090 --> 36:33.160
First there was your father
falling down the stairs,

36:33.160 --> 36:35.490
now your brother?

36:36.530 --> 36:39.970
My father passed almost 35 years ago.

36:40.450 --> 36:43.140
What does any of that
have to do with Michael?

36:43.140 --> 36:45.910
Your father was a very
troubled man,wasn't he?

36:45.910 --> 36:47.430
The social worker

36:47.430 --> 36:48.650
who interviewed you and your brother

36:48.650 --> 36:50.240
shortly after his death

36:50.240 --> 36:53.500
indicated a probable pattern of abuse.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.630
Funny thing about abuse.

36:57.130 --> 37:02.270
Oftentimes the victims
become the abusers themselves.

37:02.270 --> 37:05.220
Your father was awfully hard on you,

37:05.220 --> 37:08.570
and he tortured the hell
out of Michael,didn't he?

37:13.590 --> 37:16.140
So what are you suggesting?

37:16.780 --> 37:18.920
He's gone.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.410
They are both gone.

37:21.410 --> 37:24.550
Oliver is safe.

37:24.550 --> 37:27.310
I just want you to know...

37:27.310 --> 37:29.930
it stops here.

37:32.990 --> 37:35.510
I'm going to keep in touch.

37:38.410 --> 37:40.560
Have a safe flight.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.820
I'll call you when you get home.

37:48.770 --> 37:50.570
Bye!

37:50.600 --> 37:52.040
Hey,you!

37:52.070 --> 37:54.070
How you doing? You ready for your big trip?

37:54.100 --> 37:57.240
I just told your aunt that I
want to keep in touch with you.

37:57.270 --> 38:00.270
I want you to tell me
all about your new school

38:00.300 --> 38:02.270
and all about your new friends.

38:02.300 --> 38:05.500
Speaking of friends,where's your doll?

38:05.500 --> 38:06.610
I don't know.

38:06.610 --> 38:08.370
I think I lost her.

38:08.370 --> 38:11.000
I'm usually pretty good at finding things,

38:11.040 --> 38:12.480
guessing things,

38:12.480 --> 38:16.770
but all of a sudden,I
can't remember where she is.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.160
Well,she'll turn up if she's meant to.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.470
I don't care.

38:20.470 --> 38:23.330
I'm kind of tired of her anyway.

38:23.330 --> 38:27.080
Well,sounds like maybe you've outgrown her.

38:27.080 --> 38:27.740
Sounds like maybe

38:27.740 --> 38:30.540
you're outgrowing a lot of things.

38:35.070 --> 38:36.750
Happy travels.

38:44.140 --> 38:50.100
*

38:50.140 --> 38:52.800
That sign said we just left town.

38:56.300 --> 38:59.340
Do you have any idea what
it is you're looking for?

38:59.370 --> 39:01.370
Not really,no.

39:03.640 --> 39:04.530
I don't understand.

39:04.530 --> 39:07.330
We're at least 20 minutes from Ithaca,

39:07.330 --> 39:08.500
from the cemetery.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.000
It's after 3:00.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.740
It's going to be dark soon.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.600
Now we're not going to
be able to see her grave

39:14.640 --> 39:16.640
till tomorrow morning.

39:18.900 --> 39:19.790
I should have known better.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.960
I should have come by myself.

39:30.140 --> 39:32.270
Manny,what are you doing?

39:33.400 --> 39:36.220
Manny,where are you going?

39:47.910 --> 39:51.440
I'm sorry.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.900
I shouldn't have said that.

39:53.940 --> 39:55.740
Tomorrow is time enough.

39:55.770 --> 39:58.370
I'm just happy you're here with me.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.370
It's all crap,Lily.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.470
Everything they try to tell you about dying-

40:02.500 --> 40:03.770
it's all crap.

40:03.800 --> 40:04.970
They're just trying to sell you coffins

40:04.970 --> 40:07.130
and gravestones and funerals.

40:07.130 --> 40:09.290
The truth is,when you die,you're dead,

40:09.290 --> 40:10.290
and that's that.

40:10.290 --> 40:12.500
There are no messages from the beyond.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.880
There are no souls trying
to reach out to the living.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.330
You're here,and then you're gone,

40:16.330 --> 40:20.020
and that's why it makes
me so mad that she just...

40:22.630 --> 40:24.670
...she just threw it all away.

40:48.990 --> 40:51.090
Manuel?

40:51.090 --> 40:53.650
Manny,come here!

40:55.080 --> 40:56.330
Manny,please!

41:17.290 --> 41:19.950
Now I know why you brought me here.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.600
Look.

41:24.060 --> 41:25.930
My God.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.380
Zinnias.

41:29.380 --> 41:31.030
White zinnias.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.920
Shh.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.230
But it's the middle of winter.

41:35.230 --> 41:38.040
They were always her favorite.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.330
Hello?

41:55.200 --> 41:57.250
Hold on a second.

41:57.250 --> 41:59.000
Honey,we overslept. Oh.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.760
Phone's for you. Someone from work.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.450
Yeah.

42:02.850 --> 42:04.970
Joe Dubois.

42:04.970 --> 42:06.860
Hi,Aaron.

42:06.860 --> 42:08.740
Everything all right?

42:08.740 --> 42:10.620
Oh?

42:11.370 --> 42:13.430
Chicken pox?

42:15.990 --> 42:18.290
What? You got it from your kid?

42:18.290 --> 42:19.500
This wouldn't be the same kid

42:19.500 --> 42:21.980
that you were bringing into
work last week,would it?

42:23.770 --> 42:28.130
I see. I think I'm gonna
have to get back to you,Aaron.
