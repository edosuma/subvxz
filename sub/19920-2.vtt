00:00.001 --> 00:01.475
ANNOUNCER: <i>Previously on "Shots Fired"...</i>

00:01.500 --> 00:02.476
MAN: There's been a police shooting

00:02.501 --> 00:05.077
of an unarmed man today...
it's a black cop and a white kid.

00:05.102 --> 00:06.869
I'm Ashe Akino,

00:06.937 --> 00:08.571
your investigator.

00:08.646 --> 00:10.213
Preston Terry, your boss.

00:10.274 --> 00:11.841
The governor was just hoping
to have a quick word with you.

00:11.909 --> 00:14.315
I am fully behind this investigation.

00:14.378 --> 00:16.646
And in that moment, it
was either him or me.

00:16.714 --> 00:18.148
So y'all ain't see nothin'
or hear nothin'?

00:18.215 --> 00:19.516
No one's got answers for you,

00:19.583 --> 00:20.850
because you keep asking
the wrong question.

00:20.918 --> 00:23.653
Your son's death was never investigated?

00:23.721 --> 00:25.488
The department is obviously corrupt.

00:25.556 --> 00:27.257
MAN: Ashe Akino, you've been served.

00:27.324 --> 00:28.658
JAVIER: <i>You got to talk to my lawyer.</i>

00:28.726 --> 00:29.826
(sighs) Javier?

00:29.894 --> 00:31.928
<i>She's the only thing that makes sense.</i>

00:34.265 --> 00:36.665
(grunting)

00:38.035 --> 00:39.775
Do you think I'm incapable
of doing my job?

00:39.799 --> 00:42.205
- No
- Then stop trying to do it for me.

00:42.273 --> 00:43.840
Media's a powerful thing.

00:43.908 --> 00:46.309
They can make the guilty
innocent, the innocent guilty.

00:46.377 --> 00:48.211
And an unknown pastor a star.

00:48.279 --> 00:50.713
PASTOR JANAE: <i>Let's get both
these murdered children</i>

00:50.781 --> 00:52.982
the justice they deserve!

00:53.050 --> 00:55.685
REPORTER: <i>But what is quite
clear are the racist remarks.</i>

00:55.753 --> 00:57.520
I finally got my license
to shoot these crackers.

00:57.588 --> 00:59.856
We have got to start putting
each other's humanity first.

00:59.924 --> 01:01.324

(exhales)

01:30.387 --> 01:32.322
(sighs): Christian.

01:36.727 --> 01:37.860
Deputy Beck.

01:39.263 --> 01:41.097
I'm the father of the boy you killed.

01:42.566 --> 01:43.766
(cocks gun)

01:49.006 --> 01:50.039
Sir...

01:50.107 --> 01:51.941
I'm sure Jesse was a good kid.

01:52.009 --> 01:53.309
He was a great kid.

01:53.377 --> 01:55.044
Great kids can mess up, too.

01:55.112 --> 01:56.679
My son would never go for your gun.

01:56.747 --> 01:58.114
Just like you'd never shoot a cop?

02:02.286 --> 02:05.588
Sir, I'm a father, too. All right?

02:05.656 --> 02:07.957
If anything would happen to my boys,
I don't know what I'd do.

02:08.025 --> 02:10.029
- Doesn't matter... your boys are fine.
- Listen to me.

02:10.054 --> 02:13.630
I'm not gonna tell you
I understand your pain.

02:13.697 --> 02:15.565
I don't.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.667
But you weren't there.

02:17.735 --> 02:19.836
If you ever want to know the truth

02:19.903 --> 02:22.639
about what happened that day,

02:22.706 --> 02:25.908
you need to drop your weapon now.

02:34.184 --> 02:35.418
(uncocks gun)

02:46.764 --> 02:49.499
I do know what really happened.

03:11.322 --> 03:12.729
Hey, you talk to him?

03:12.754 --> 03:14.424
DECLAN: <i>Yeah, listen, Ashe,
he wants sole custody</i>

03:14.491 --> 03:16.559
<i>and doesn't want to drag Kai
through court.</i>

03:16.627 --> 03:18.524

(beeps)

03:36.880 --> 03:38.201
Hey, it's Preston.

03:38.226 --> 03:40.750
Gonna grab breakfast.
I'll be back in an hour.

04:02.506 --> 04:03.706
WOMAN: You're getting so big.

04:03.774 --> 04:06.242
(children clamoring)

04:35.305 --> 04:36.973
Yo, Cory.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.241
Oh.

04:38.308 --> 04:39.475
My bad.

04:40.811 --> 04:42.311
That's dope.

04:42.379 --> 04:44.414
What's it, uh, what's it gonna be?

04:44.481 --> 04:47.083
Joey.

04:49.686 --> 04:51.754
So what do you think
really happened to him?

05:11.475 --> 05:12.542
RUIZ: <i>How's the rookie?</i>

05:12.609 --> 05:14.944
(sighs) Jury's still out.

05:15.012 --> 05:16.612
<i>Saw his Sermon on the Mount speech.</i>

05:16.680 --> 05:20.483
<i>Deputy chief is star-struck,

05:20.551 --> 05:21.984
<i>If you tell him that Black Jesus is</i>

<i>in over his head, know that I'm on deck.</i>

05:24.354 --> 05:26.489
I'll let you know.

05:31.361 --> 05:32.295
Morning.

05:32.362 --> 05:33.896
Morning. Mind if I drive?

05:35.232 --> 05:36.933
Whatever.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.855
REPORTER: <i>We're live here
at the funeral of Jesse Carr.</i>

05:45.933 --> 05:48.511
<i>He is the white unarmed
teenager who was gunned down</i>

05:48.579 --> 05:50.847
<i>by a black sheriff's deputy.
Now, as you can imagine,</i>

05:50.914 --> 05:53.349
<i>tension's running pretty high
after the recent discovery</i>

05:53.417 --> 05:57.320
<i>of that sheriff deputy's racist rant
caught on videotape.</i>

05:57.387 --> 06:01.891
<i>Yeah, I finally got my license
to shoot these crackers. (laughs)</i>

06:01.959 --> 06:04.527
REPORTER: <i>A heartbreaking and
certainly controversial video...</i>

06:04.595 --> 06:05.761
Just turn it off.

06:05.829 --> 06:07.230
<i>...an officer of the law
who took an oath</i>

06:07.297 --> 06:08.865
<i>to serve and protect.</i>

06:08.932 --> 06:10.600
Now, Deputy Beck claims that Jesse...

06:10.667 --> 06:13.536
Why are people taking
pictures of our house?

06:13.604 --> 06:17.240
Because you're in it, superstar. Huh?

06:17.307 --> 06:19.075
Now, go get your brother, all right?

06:19.142 --> 06:20.776
We're out of here.

06:20.844 --> 06:22.778
Seriously, Kerry.

06:24.314 --> 06:25.314
(television turns off)

06:26.016 --> 06:28.918
- Hey.
- What?

06:39.162 --> 06:40.162
I love you.

06:41.231 --> 06:42.632
I love you more.

06:44.468 --> 06:47.603
(boys chattering indistinctly)

06:47.671 --> 06:49.405
Come on, boys!

06:49.473 --> 06:52.174
Let's go! Hut-two, huttwo,
hut-two, let's go!

06:52.242 --> 06:55.344
(door opens, reporters shouting questions)

06:55.412 --> 06:57.813
(door closes)

06:57.881 --> 06:59.148
REPORTER: <i>It's a really
full house here today.</i>

06:59.216 --> 07:01.284
<i>It's an unbelievable turnout,</i>

07:01.351 --> 07:02.966
<i>and the governor has just arrived.</i>

07:03.051 --> 07:04.921
- (reporters clamoring)
- Governor.

07:04.988 --> 07:06.789
Governor, what are you
feeling right now?

07:08.692 --> 07:10.709
Why is the media giving
more attention to...

07:10.794 --> 07:13.896
We got to figure out who leaked
that video of Officer Beck.

07:13.964 --> 07:14.997
It changes everything.

07:15.065 --> 07:19.468
Black cop shoots white kid
and this video drops.

07:19.536 --> 07:20.536
A little suspicious.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.071
Suspicious or not, he said it.

07:22.139 --> 07:23.472
Could make it a hate crime.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.841
Plenty of white cops called us worse.

07:25.909 --> 07:28.500
Heard it to my face...
I'm sure Beck has, too.

07:28.586 --> 07:29.887
We're not investigating them.

07:29.946 --> 07:30.980
That's the problem.

07:31.048 --> 07:34.183
Look, whoever leaked this video
can speak to Beck's character.

07:34.251 --> 07:36.085
Maybe he had some sort of a racial bias

07:36.153 --> 07:37.420
and they're wanting to expose him.

07:37.487 --> 07:39.221
Or maybe they wanted to hurt him,

07:39.289 --> 07:40.823
make him look guilty.

07:40.891 --> 07:42.224
He's the only brother in the department.

07:42.292 --> 07:44.360
Maybe they want his ass out.

07:46.296 --> 07:48.264
We both know something ain't right here.

07:48.331 --> 07:50.700
Lieutenant Breeland threatened Shameeka

07:50.767 --> 07:53.235
to keep quiet
about her son's murder... why?

07:54.535 --> 07:57.673
Oh, my bad. That's not a D.O.J. case.

08:04.972 --> 08:06.515
MINISTER: When Jesus died,

08:07.160 --> 08:08.984
mourners had to ask themselves,

08:09.052 --> 08:12.688
were they going to be better
people because Jesus lived?

08:12.756 --> 08:16.792
Jesse Carr lived on this
Earth for 19 years.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.695
What can you learn about yourself

08:19.763 --> 08:24.133
from his life and his untimely death?

08:24.201 --> 08:27.236
<i>As you reflect on the
life of this young man,</i>

08:27.304 --> 08:28.971
<i>ask yourself:</i>

08:29.039 --> 08:31.073
<i>will you become</i>

08:31.141 --> 08:34.510
<i>a better person or will you not?</i>

08:34.578 --> 08:35.745
<i>To honor Jesse</i>

and his family, please receive

Governor, you're in the middle
of a tight reelection race.

10:30.095 --> 10:32.129
How will Jesse Carr's death
impact voters?

10:32.197 --> 10:33.698
A young man lost his life.

10:33.765 --> 10:35.266
A mother lost her son.

10:35.341 --> 10:37.386
This is a time for prayer, not politics.

10:37.411 --> 10:38.603
- (reporters clamoring)
- Governor!

10:38.670 --> 10:40.704
Alicia.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.608
What can I do?

10:43.675 --> 10:46.544
Your tears are 15 years
too late, Randall.

10:52.217 --> 10:55.119
If you have a minute,
the governor would like a word.

10:55.187 --> 10:56.354
Sure.

11:00.325 --> 11:02.660
Um, sorry, Ms. Akino, just Preston.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.729
"Preston," huh?

11:04.796 --> 11:06.397
Not "Mr. Terry"?

11:10.068 --> 11:11.502
I've received hundreds of calls

11:11.570 --> 11:14.435
asking why Beck hasn't been arrested.
How would you answer?

11:14.497 --> 11:17.541
Well, we're still in the early stages
of the investigation.

11:17.609 --> 11:19.343
He's on video saying he has

11:19.411 --> 11:20.978
a license to kill white people.

11:21.046 --> 11:22.813
The video may speak to motive, ma'am,

11:22.881 --> 11:24.381
but it's not grounds for an arrest.

11:24.449 --> 11:25.883
I need to prove he acted willfully

11:25.951 --> 11:27.051
beyond a reasonable doubt.

11:27.119 --> 11:28.853
And how long will that take?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.675
Ma'am, do you want this done right
or do you want this done quickly?

11:31.723 --> 11:34.625
I'm expecting you to do both.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.894
If Deputy Beck intentionally
victimized Jesse

11:36.962 --> 11:38.452
because of bias, he will be indicted.

11:38.547 --> 11:41.315
And if he acted in self-defense,
then he'll be cleared.

11:41.383 --> 11:43.050
The truth is my only compass.

11:43.118 --> 11:45.152
That's a nice compass to have.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.254
I don't have the luxury of getting lost.

11:47.322 --> 11:49.090
I'm the first female governor
of this state.

11:49.157 --> 11:50.257
Neither do I.

11:50.325 --> 11:52.326
I'd like to invite you

11:52.394 --> 11:54.261
to an event tomorrow night as my guest.

11:54.329 --> 11:56.420
I'd be honored, Governor, but my father,

11:56.498 --> 11:59.256
- he's, he's in from out of town...
- The invitation extends to him as well.

12:00.769 --> 12:02.536
Thank you, ma'am.

12:02.604 --> 12:04.338
Well, I'm pleased that the governor came

12:04.406 --> 12:05.806
to show her support

12:05.874 --> 12:07.842
for Alicia Carr and her son Jesse.

12:07.909 --> 12:10.211
No mother should have to bury a child.

12:10.278 --> 12:13.681
It violates the natural order of things.

12:13.749 --> 12:16.951
But what about the mothers
on the other side of town

12:17.019 --> 12:20.121
who have buried their sons
and their daughters?

12:20.188 --> 12:22.890
Will the governor
show her support for them?

12:22.958 --> 12:27.128
17-year-old Joey Campbell
was murdered three weeks ago,

12:27.195 --> 12:28.963
and nothing.

12:29.031 --> 12:30.698
No investigation,

12:30.766 --> 12:34.168
no motorcade, no empathy.

12:34.236 --> 12:36.871
So I pose this question to her...

12:36.938 --> 12:39.240
what about Joey?

12:39.307 --> 12:41.409
♪

12:45.981 --> 12:48.649
You're the man
from the Department of Justice.

12:48.717 --> 12:49.917
Preston Terry, sir.

12:49.985 --> 12:51.419
Mr. Dabney.

12:51.486 --> 12:53.487
But everyone around here calls me Mr. D.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.856
You bring your appetite?

12:55.924 --> 12:57.058
How about a salad?

12:57.125 --> 12:58.225
(laughs)

12:58.293 --> 12:59.827
The only greens we got around here

12:59.895 --> 13:01.662
are cooked slow with neck bones.

13:02.304 --> 13:05.363
- This is quite the spot.
- Yeah, my dad opened it.

13:05.430 --> 13:06.467
Between the two of us,

13:06.535 --> 13:09.637
we fed three generations in this town.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.973
Dizzy Gillespie, Hank Aaron,
and too many mayors to count.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.842
So how does one get on your wall?

13:16.445 --> 13:19.313
You got to do a lot more
than lock up a black cop.

13:21.416 --> 13:22.683
(sighs)

13:24.553 --> 13:26.187
You ever feed Joey Campbell?

13:28.190 --> 13:30.191
Every now and then, I had to tell him

13:30.258 --> 13:33.029
to pull up his pants,
but he was good people.

13:33.138 --> 13:34.395
Anyone have it out for him?

13:34.943 --> 13:37.951
I thought you was only here
for that white boy.

13:39.234 --> 13:40.868
I thought I was, too.

13:42.804 --> 13:44.171
I'll ask around.

13:44.239 --> 13:47.141
You mind if we keep this
between me and you?

13:49.111 --> 13:50.644
Then between me and you,

13:50.712 --> 13:52.646
I'll see if I can find
some lettuce in back.

13:55.817 --> 13:57.918
(fans cheering, shouting)

14:03.191 --> 14:04.358
(whistle blows)

14:04.426 --> 14:05.426
Time-out!

14:07.095 --> 14:08.662
42, get over here!

14:10.565 --> 14:13.539
This is a 25-yarder.
You can do this in your sleep.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.603
- Yes, Coach.
- Go.

14:15.670 --> 14:16.837
Tommy!

14:18.106 --> 14:19.707
Your black ass better block her

14:19.775 --> 14:22.176
like your life depends on it,
'cause it does!

14:22.244 --> 14:23.277
Nothing happens to my daughter.

14:23.345 --> 14:24.545
- Yes, Coach!
- Go!

14:26.548 --> 14:28.115
(cheering)

14:30.685 --> 14:32.019
Hut!

14:35.924 --> 14:38.359
(cheering)

14:45.467 --> 14:46.500
AKINO: Volunteer coach.

14:46.568 --> 14:48.202
Each one teach one.

14:48.270 --> 14:49.870
What the hell are you doing here?

14:49.938 --> 14:51.338
You said you don't go in the box.

14:51.406 --> 14:52.706
Got to be creative.

14:55.577 --> 14:57.077
So what'd you think of Beck's video?

14:57.145 --> 14:59.313
I think it's the last time he gets drunk

14:59.381 --> 15:00.815
and talks to a camera.

15:00.882 --> 15:02.449
Whoever leaked it wanted to hurt him.

15:02.517 --> 15:03.450
Any ideas?

15:03.518 --> 15:04.819
No.

15:04.886 --> 15:07.755
Like you said, y'all are family.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.024
And nobody hurts you like your own.

15:10.091 --> 15:12.593
I'm gonna go celebrate with my team now.

15:14.930 --> 15:17.170
Why did you threaten Shameeka
after her son was murdered?

15:17.232 --> 15:18.432
Excuse me?

15:18.500 --> 15:19.667
Joey Campbell's mother.

15:19.734 --> 15:21.602
- You got some balls on you.
- Thank you.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.870
You got an answer?

15:24.439 --> 15:26.340
Joey was a drug dealer and she knew it

15:26.408 --> 15:28.309
and she did nothing, and now he is dead.

15:28.376 --> 15:32.446
I don't want to see her other son
end up the same way.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.281
I was trying to scare her straight.

15:49.710 --> 15:51.131
Hey.

15:51.199 --> 15:52.466
How you doing?

15:52.534 --> 15:54.561
I'm all right.

15:55.604 --> 15:57.238
It's tough, though, man.

15:57.305 --> 16:02.977
Our job is to make it home
to our families, no matter what.

16:03.044 --> 16:04.311
Yeah.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.183
- So you want to kill crackers, huh?
- The video was a joke.

16:09.251 --> 16:11.185
I ain't laughing.

16:11.253 --> 16:12.753
Mind getting the hell out of my way?

16:12.821 --> 16:13.821
No, Beck.

16:13.855 --> 16:14.855
You're in my way.

16:16.191 --> 16:17.358
That's enough, that's enough!

16:17.425 --> 16:19.159
That's enough!

16:19.227 --> 16:20.160
It's over!

16:20.228 --> 16:22.429
It's over!

16:22.497 --> 16:25.766
I always knew you were
his little bitch, Brooks.

16:27.002 --> 16:28.302
Be safe out there.

16:28.370 --> 16:30.604
It's dangerous.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.663
Well, it ain't the Taj Mahal,

16:39.766 --> 16:41.466
but I got you a room with a view, Pop.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.935
I'm sure I'll be comfortable.
Thanks, son.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.656
Why aren't you staying
at your brother's place?

16:45.786 --> 16:48.156
Oh, he's 45 minutes away.

16:48.289 --> 16:49.674
All right, look,
I won't be able to see you

16:49.742 --> 16:52.086
once you get down there, so we
should grab some breakfast,

16:52.148 --> 16:53.678
- chop it up.
- Absolutely.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.357
I want to hear
about this new job you got.

16:55.427 --> 16:56.815
Mace said you've just been on TV?

16:56.881 --> 16:59.684
I got to tell you, I think this one's
gonna be a game-changer, Pop.

16:59.759 --> 17:01.626
- Really?
- (hip-hop music blaring)

17:02.956 --> 17:04.222
What the hell?

17:04.324 --> 17:06.856
- WOMAN: Wow, it's Maceo Terry!
- Hey, ladies.

17:06.881 --> 17:08.060
WOMAN: Hi.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.162
- Ha-ha!
- What the hell are you doing here?

17:10.229 --> 17:12.064
You know I couldn't wait
to see you, Pops.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.231
What up?

17:13.299 --> 17:14.299
You smell good.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.667
What up, Pres?

17:16.736 --> 17:17.970
I thought you were coming by tomorrow.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.073
Yeah, I know, but
a signing event popped up.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.608
Whole team's gonna be there
if you want to roll, Pops.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.911
Well, now, you know I want
to get me a picture with Cam.

17:25.912 --> 17:26.823
Mm-hmm.

17:26.848 --> 17:28.814
But your brother and I are
about to grab something to eat.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.483
Nah, it's all right
if you want to go, Pop.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.685
- You sure?
- Yeah.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.687
Yeah, you're more than welcome
to come too, if you want.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.456
Nah, I... I got work.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.191
- Ah...
- We'll talk later?

17:39.258 --> 17:41.627
- Yeah, yeah, I'll see you later.
- Can you take care of these for me?

17:41.694 --> 17:42.928
Got you.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.034
What up, Pops?
Damn, you're looking good!

17:52.071 --> 17:54.473
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, kiddo.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.974
You all right?

17:56.142 --> 17:57.843
- Could be better.
- Let me guess.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.177
There's a party tonight

17:59.245 --> 18:02.314
- and your mom said you can't go.
- She called you.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.049
Yep.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.218
I did all my homework and
everyone's gonna be there.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.221
No promises, but I will talk to her.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.788
Thanks.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.659
Go on.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.759
What now? Money?

18:21.834 --> 18:24.169
At the game, you told Tommy
if his black ass

18:24.237 --> 18:26.037
didn't block for me that you'd kill him.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.839
It worked, didn't it?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.775
That's racist.

18:31.511 --> 18:35.680
Tess... I didn't talk to him
like that because he's black.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.115
I talked to him like that

18:37.183 --> 18:38.850
because he's the biggest guy we have.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.952
And some guys need a foot up their ass,

18:41.020 --> 18:42.354
and he is one of them.

18:42.421 --> 18:45.524
- That's it.
- Okay.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.192
(sighs)

18:47.260 --> 18:48.894
Now get your white ass to the party.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.062
I can go?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.198
I'll tell your mama I called an audible.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.005
EDDIE: <i>Only in America</i>

19:00.072 --> 19:01.339
would the Civil Rights Department send

19:01.407 --> 19:03.008
two black people to put the noose

19:03.075 --> 19:05.577
around a black man's neck
and call it justice.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.412
Your son brought his own rope, sir.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.290
BECK: <i>Yeah, uh, I finally got
my license to shoot these crackers.</i>

19:11.315 --> 19:13.718
<i>(laughs)</i>

19:13.786 --> 19:16.054
That was a happy day.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.657
A family barbecue celebrating

19:18.724 --> 19:20.525
his graduation from the police academy.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.934
He was just fooling around
and being silly.

19:23.012 --> 19:25.096
Wait, so a family member shot this?

19:26.247 --> 19:29.201
We're not the ones
trying to lynch him, Mr. Beck.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.869
The person who leaked the video is.

19:38.644 --> 19:41.213
(sighs)

19:41.280 --> 19:43.782
The voice on that video
is my nephew, Junior.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.465
- Know where he is now?
- I know where he'll be tonight,

19:46.566 --> 19:48.871
but you won't be able to find it
on any map.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.090

Damn.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.070
I know you?

20:32.163 --> 20:34.306
I'm an investigator.
I'm just looking for a conversation.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.901
About what?

20:35.968 --> 20:38.136
How much you get for selling
that video of your cousin?

20:38.204 --> 20:39.504
That ain't polite.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.848
Pretty sure you don't respond to polite.

20:41.942 --> 20:44.661
It's funny, I was getting
the same feeling about you.

20:44.747 --> 20:47.179
I'm gonna ask you not to be basic.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.482
Nobody gives up something for nothing.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.045
- Damn!
- Ashe!

20:55.521 --> 20:56.822
Now, I can break your wrist

20:56.889 --> 20:58.108
and they can start calling you "Lefty,"

20:58.170 --> 21:00.992
- or you can tell me about the video.
- I didn't sell it.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.117
- Your voice was on it, you shot it.
- I lost my phone a year ago.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.464
- Police took it when I was arrested.
- For what?

21:06.532 --> 21:08.266
Jaywalking. Never gave it back.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.603
Ah, damn!

21:13.306 --> 21:15.607
Appreciate your time.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.206
You just threatened a potential witness.

21:21.282 --> 21:22.816
He put his hands on me.

21:22.901 --> 21:24.716
I was right there;
you weren't in any danger.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.452
Did I pull my gun? No.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.091
I talk trash so I don't
have to hurt nobody.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.890
My job is to gather information.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.439
Yours is to fondle it when I'm done.

21:33.464 --> 21:35.894
Look, you don't have to respect me,
but you will respect the law.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.495
We do things the right way.

21:37.563 --> 21:38.963
It's my ass on the line, not yours.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.704
Everything's been deleted...

21:51.791 --> 21:54.580
contacts, photos, videos, everything.

21:54.674 --> 21:56.682
Junior wouldn't have done that.
Doesn't make any sense.

21:56.768 --> 21:58.616
Made sense to somebody.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.054
Well, the report says
the arresting officer

22:03.122 --> 22:05.590
was Beck's boy, Caleb Brooks.

22:09.528 --> 22:10.895
You wanted to see me?

22:10.963 --> 22:12.931
You were the one who arrested Junior.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.885
You took his phone,
pulled the video off,

22:14.963 --> 22:16.502
but not before leaking it to the press.

22:16.596 --> 22:19.025
- Why?
- I didn't release it to the press.

22:19.143 --> 22:21.182
But if someone were
to accidentally delete the data

22:21.268 --> 22:23.942
off his phone, I wouldn't be upset.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.877
What he said was a joke.

22:25.945 --> 22:30.615
I'm sure you've said one or two
dumb-ass things in your life.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.851
The difference is
it ain't playing on a loop.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.622
Who had access to the video

22:37.690 --> 22:39.924
before it was accidentally deleted?

22:39.992 --> 22:41.493
I don't know.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.803
But if Josh is some racist black cop,

22:43.881 --> 22:46.398
then how come he and I are best friends?

22:52.402 --> 22:54.433
Close your eyes, Daddy, okay?

22:54.535 --> 22:56.535
It's a secret handshake.

22:58.131 --> 23:00.232
(clapping)

23:00.308 --> 23:02.615
BOTH: <i>I love you.</i>

23:02.701 --> 23:05.036
(clapping)

23:06.805 --> 23:07.972
<i>Bam!</i>

23:08.040 --> 23:09.707
<i>(Kai speaking indistinctly)</i>

23:14.847 --> 23:16.447
Your father had second thoughts
about attending?

23:16.515 --> 23:17.982
Not at all, Governor;
he's meeting me here.

23:18.050 --> 23:19.784
- Oh, good.
- How are you, Doc?

23:19.852 --> 23:20.952
Oh, never better, Jake.

23:21.019 --> 23:22.620
I'd like you to meet Preston Terry

23:22.688 --> 23:24.389
from the Department of Justice.

23:24.456 --> 23:26.150
I didn't do it, I swear.

23:26.225 --> 23:27.665
And of course you know Sheriff Platt

23:27.726 --> 23:29.294
- and the good Reverend DuPont.
- How you doing?

23:29.361 --> 23:32.397
Let's see, a doctor,
a sheriff, and a reverend.

23:32.464 --> 23:34.465
There's got to be a joke
in there somewhere.

23:34.533 --> 23:35.518
- (laughter)
- There must be.

23:36.138 --> 23:37.450
Excuse me.

23:39.538 --> 23:42.473
Standing 8:45 tee time at Crystal Lake.

23:42.541 --> 23:44.364
If you can spare the time.

23:44.458 --> 23:45.482
I should warn you, I've been known

23:45.536 --> 23:46.857
to prosecute anyone who beats me.

23:46.942 --> 23:47.912
(laughs)

23:47.980 --> 23:48.974
Right.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.048
(tapping glass)

23:50.115 --> 23:51.115
Thank you.

23:53.319 --> 23:55.119
Come on, come on in.

23:55.187 --> 23:57.355
You're all welcome.

23:57.423 --> 23:58.956
(clears throat)

24:01.226 --> 24:05.029
When my father came here
to this country from Belarus,

24:05.097 --> 24:08.032
he could neither read nor write.

24:08.100 --> 24:12.003
But he could work, and
he worked hard enough

24:12.071 --> 24:14.105
so that he could buy the piece of land

24:14.173 --> 24:16.140
that he passed down to me.

24:16.208 --> 24:20.278
On the signature line, there is an X,

24:20.346 --> 24:23.514
because my dad never learned
how to write his own name.

24:25.284 --> 24:28.052
I think of how proud he must be...

24:30.689 --> 24:32.557
...about the freedoms

24:32.624 --> 24:35.245
this country has provided for his son.

24:35.346 --> 24:36.346
- Yeah.
- Yes.

24:36.417 --> 24:41.199
Now, I'm standing in the middle
of my most ambitious project to date.

24:41.266 --> 24:42.734
(laughter)

24:42.801 --> 24:47.805
Here, we have a state-of-the-art
hospital on-site,

24:47.873 --> 24:50.341
and here, we have a farm.

24:50.409 --> 24:52.577
This facility will hold

24:52.644 --> 24:57.368
one of the best high school, college,
and trade schools in this region.

24:57.438 --> 24:59.417
(applause)

24:59.485 --> 25:03.821
Our prisoners will not
leave here recriminalized;

25:03.889 --> 25:06.491
they will leave here revitalized.

25:06.558 --> 25:11.344
Between construction and staff,
this correctional facility

25:11.516 --> 25:14.098
will bring thousands of jobs
to this state.

25:14.166 --> 25:17.264
(applause)

25:17.366 --> 25:19.335
I know a lot of you are investors,

25:19.413 --> 25:22.707
so hold your applause until we
get the first-quarter P&Ls.

25:22.775 --> 25:23.725
(laughter)

25:23.811 --> 25:25.996
Now, you know how much
I love the spotlight,

25:26.044 --> 25:27.979
but, um, you didn't pay

25:28.046 --> 25:31.592
$25,000 a plate to hear me talk.

25:31.983 --> 25:37.054
We are here to support
Governor Patricia Eamons.

25:37.122 --> 25:39.357
(applause)

25:39.425 --> 25:41.726
Thank you. Thank you!

25:41.794 --> 25:43.127
(phone buzzes)

25:43.195 --> 25:44.896
EAMONS: 25 grand a plate?

25:44.963 --> 25:46.831
Hope you all brought Tupperware.

25:46.899 --> 25:47.832
(laughter)

25:47.900 --> 25:51.369
- I want to thank Arlen...
- Pops, where you at?

25:51.437 --> 25:53.004
<i>Your brother had a bad game.</i>

25:53.071 --> 25:54.005
That happens.

25:54.072 --> 25:55.173
<i>Two fumbles.</i>

25:55.240 --> 25:56.908
<i>Crowd got on him pretty tough.</i>

25:56.975 --> 25:58.409
<i>Let me get his head right.</i>

25:58.477 --> 26:00.592
<i>- I'll call you back.</i>
- When I took over this state,

26:00.677 --> 26:02.224
unemployment was at nine percent,

26:02.326 --> 26:04.015
and I said, "Unacceptable.

26:04.082 --> 26:06.684
Only reason she wanted me there
was to show her rich donors

26:06.752 --> 26:08.653
she has a D.O.J. prosecutor
in her pocket.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.622
Then why accept the invitation?

26:11.690 --> 26:13.406
Because I belong there.

26:13.476 --> 26:15.359
You know, you could make or break

26:15.427 --> 26:16.761
the governor's re-election.

26:16.829 --> 26:19.130
Oh, so is that what you're doing?

26:19.198 --> 26:21.165
Keeping me close?

26:21.233 --> 26:23.290
You made the first move,

26:23.376 --> 26:27.038
so maybe it's you
who's keeping me close.

26:27.105 --> 26:28.840
Because really,

26:28.907 --> 26:30.875
this case could make or break you.

26:30.943 --> 26:33.611
People may think I'll break,
but I won't.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.880
People

26:35.948 --> 26:37.682
Are we talking about
anyone in particular?

26:37.749 --> 26:41.052
Well, if they're not here,
they don't matter.

26:41.119 --> 26:43.054
♪

26:51.730 --> 26:52.964
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:53.031 --> 26:54.031
What up, flawless?

26:54.066 --> 26:56.667
You looking for your brother?

26:56.735 --> 26:58.135
Actually, I found exactly
who I'm looking for.

26:58.203 --> 26:59.637
You get my flowers?

26:59.705 --> 27:02.173
Yes, yeah, thank you.

27:02.241 --> 27:04.108
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

27:04.176 --> 27:06.644
So you gonna have me standing
in the hallway like this?

27:06.712 --> 27:07.912
Come on, let me in.

27:07.980 --> 27:12.183
Mace, you got talent,
no doubt about that.

27:12.251 --> 27:14.285
But I ain't looking to put a ring on it.

27:14.353 --> 27:16.420
And I didn't think you were either.

27:16.488 --> 27:18.623
(laughs) You're playing with me, right?

27:18.690 --> 27:20.358
I'm really not.

27:24.298 --> 27:27.131
Damn, so you really do got issues, huh?

27:28.251 --> 27:30.635
And it ain't so sexy
when I'm sober, either.

27:30.702 --> 27:33.971
Mm, so I got issues 'cause
I don't want to smash twice?

27:34.039 --> 27:36.230
No, whatever, girl, if you want to act
like a random groupie chick,

27:36.324 --> 27:38.109
I'm gonna treat you like
a random groupie chick.

27:38.176 --> 27:41.679
Kind of hard when you're
standing outside <i>my</i> door.

27:45.684 --> 27:49.453
<i>17-year-old Joey Campbell
was murdered three weeks ago,</i>

27:49.521 --> 27:53.791
<i>and nothing... no investigation,
no motorcade, no empathy.</i>

27:53.859 --> 27:57.995
<i>So I pose this question to her:
what about Joey?</i>

27:58.063 --> 27:59.630
10,000 views already.

27:59.698 --> 28:02.066
Over 1,000 likes.

28:02.134 --> 28:06.437
Pastor Janae has publicly called me out.
What do you know about her?

28:06.505 --> 28:08.973
She's a spoiled little girl
who got her feelings hurt

28:09.041 --> 28:11.776
because I wouldn't
let her speak from my pulpit.

28:11.843 --> 28:14.679
Do any women speak from your pulpit?

28:14.746 --> 28:16.447
(chuckles)

28:16.515 --> 28:18.649
I'm old-school, Governor,
guilty as charged.

28:18.717 --> 28:20.351
But I wouldn't worry about her.

28:20.419 --> 28:23.087
She does not have a solid
foothold in the black community.

28:23.155 --> 28:24.293
Sarah?

28:24.395 --> 28:27.699
What she does have is
40,000 followers on Twitter,

28:27.809 --> 28:32.096
70,000 on Instagram, and
20,000 on Snapchat.

28:32.164 --> 28:34.332
Since she brought Alicia Carr
and Shameeka Campbell together,

28:34.399 --> 28:36.300
her numbers have quadrupled.

28:36.368 --> 28:39.337
If you're no longer the
voice of your community,

28:39.404 --> 28:41.205
why am I such an avid supporter

28:41.273 --> 28:45.509
of your various
not-for-profit activities?

28:45.577 --> 28:49.947
Social media does not compare
to the power of TV.

28:50.015 --> 28:52.483
I'll call my friends at the local news.

28:52.551 --> 28:54.785
I know the game.

28:54.853 --> 28:56.621
I know my people.

28:56.688 --> 28:59.056
PASTOR JANAE: Here we are on
the steps of the courthouse,

28:59.124 --> 29:01.058
where justice claims to be blind.

29:01.126 --> 29:02.493
She sure is.

29:02.561 --> 29:06.130
Justice heard Jesse Carr loud and clear,

29:06.198 --> 29:07.832
but what about Joey?

29:07.899 --> 29:09.006
(murmuring agreement)

29:09.092 --> 29:12.803
So today, we go beyond justice
to the power that controls her,

29:12.871 --> 29:14.514
and to that power, we say...

29:14.623 --> 29:16.717
- Whose power?
- PROTESTERS: Our power!

29:16.803 --> 29:18.686
- What power?
- This power!

29:18.780 --> 29:20.397
- Whose power?
- Our power!

29:20.483 --> 29:21.846
- What power?
- Get out of here!

29:21.913 --> 29:23.774
- Whose power?
- Our power!

29:23.875 --> 29:25.416
- What power?
- This power!

29:25.452 --> 29:26.919
- Whose power?
- Our power!

29:27.026 --> 29:29.027
- What power?
- This power!

29:29.087 --> 29:31.155
We're here to help, Pastor Janae.

29:33.030 --> 29:35.126
Where were you two years ago,
Brother DuPont,

29:35.193 --> 29:37.161
when I asked for your guidance?

29:37.229 --> 29:38.863
Oh, that's right.

29:38.930 --> 29:40.831
No cameras were around back then.

29:40.899 --> 29:42.967
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be drinking

29:43.035 --> 29:45.126
from the "colored only" fountain.

29:45.220 --> 29:47.821
And we all know how much you love
drinking from that white fountain.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.235
- (laughs)
- MAN: What you gonna do for Joey, Rev?

29:51.423 --> 29:53.844
I am so proud of you and your efforts.

29:53.912 --> 29:55.980
May I pray with you, sister?

29:56.048 --> 29:58.683
Of course.

30:12.297 --> 30:14.999
Dear Heavenly Father, please...

30:15.067 --> 30:17.501
Please let us know you are with us,

30:17.569 --> 30:20.337
right now in this moment.

30:20.405 --> 30:21.839
Let there be no doubt, Lord,

30:21.907 --> 30:23.641
that we are in the midst of a calling.

30:23.709 --> 30:25.843
You put us here.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.511
Your purpose is clear.

30:27.579 --> 30:32.083
You are no longer
Christ the tranquilizer;

30:32.150 --> 30:36.320
you are Christ the energizer,
Christ the revitalizer.

30:36.388 --> 30:38.589
Anger is not a sin.

30:38.657 --> 30:41.692
I say unto you again,
anger is not a sin.

30:41.760 --> 30:46.597
In fact, anger in the face
of racism and injustice

30:46.665 --> 30:52.069
and false prophets is not
a sin, but a weapon.

30:52.137 --> 30:56.774
Guide us to use this
weapon to serve you well.

30:56.842 --> 30:59.443
We are your humble,

30:59.511 --> 31:03.380
angry servants of God!

31:03.448 --> 31:05.316
Let the people of God say...

31:05.383 --> 31:06.851
PROTESTERS: Amen!

31:07.501 --> 31:09.314
- (cheering)
- Yeah.

31:11.314 --> 31:13.197
We with you Pastor.

31:13.291 --> 31:15.459
MAN: We're gonna fight for Joey!

31:15.527 --> 31:17.695
We want justice!

31:21.743 --> 31:23.868
Leading prayer is one thing.

31:23.935 --> 31:25.703
Leading people is another.

31:25.771 --> 31:26.771
(chuckles)

31:29.474 --> 31:31.642
- Whose power?
- PROTESTERS: Our power!

31:31.710 --> 31:33.711
- What power?
- This power!

31:33.779 --> 31:35.246
- Whose power?
- Our power!

31:35.313 --> 31:37.314
- What power?
- This power!

31:37.382 --> 31:38.582
- Whose power?
- Our power!

31:38.650 --> 31:40.384
- What power?
- This power!

31:40.452 --> 31:42.052
- Whose power?
- Our power!

31:44.746 --> 31:46.363
Don't. Don't even.

31:46.458 --> 31:49.121
I used to hate the dudes who
worked security at the roller rink.

31:49.184 --> 31:51.936
We used to drop firecrackers on
the floor just to mess with them.

31:52.030 --> 31:53.147
(laughing)

31:53.202 --> 31:54.765
Wait 'til you're married with kids.

31:54.832 --> 31:56.366
You're gonna work two jobs, too.

31:56.434 --> 31:59.770
Yeah, well, she wants to see
your best man speech,

31:59.837 --> 32:01.805
you know, just time it out.

32:03.941 --> 32:05.442
What?

32:05.510 --> 32:07.492
Anna don't want to see a damn thing.

32:07.578 --> 32:09.780
You want to see it 'cause you're afraid
I'm gonna say something dumb.

32:09.890 --> 32:11.448
Hey, the last speech you made at a party

32:11.516 --> 32:12.516
is on the news now.

32:12.550 --> 32:14.051
Oh, that's cold.

32:14.118 --> 32:15.352
- That's so cold.
- (laughs)

32:15.420 --> 32:17.020
BROOKS: There he is.

32:20.458 --> 32:21.491
Hey, cuzzo,

32:21.559 --> 32:23.527
let me talk to you for a second.

32:23.594 --> 32:24.661
Hey, yo!

32:43.414 --> 32:46.149
Get up! Get up!

32:46.217 --> 32:47.517
What'd I do?!

32:47.585 --> 32:48.885
The hell you do with that video, huh?

32:48.953 --> 32:50.020
Nothing!

32:50.088 --> 32:51.588
Then how'd it get leaked?

32:51.656 --> 32:53.824
Ask your boy; he the one
that took my phone.

32:53.891 --> 32:55.425
You made copies, right?

32:55.493 --> 32:57.053
You pull it off the cloud or something?

32:57.095 --> 32:58.995
Josh, you really gonna trust
this white boy over me?

32:59.063 --> 33:00.503
You about to turn me into the killer

33:00.531 --> 33:01.798
you got these people thinking I am.

33:01.866 --> 33:03.300
How much you get paid for it, huh?

33:03.367 --> 33:04.801
All right, cuz, here's the truth.

33:04.869 --> 33:07.270
I didn't leak it, but I wish I did,

33:07.338 --> 33:09.039
'cause you deserve everything
that's coming to you.

33:09.107 --> 33:10.540
I deserve everything
that's coming to me?!

33:10.608 --> 33:12.785
- Get off me, man!
- MAN: Hey, what's going on out there?

33:15.413 --> 33:17.347
Junior, you all right?

33:20.051 --> 33:22.319
(blues music playing)

33:22.386 --> 33:24.054
You looking for another salad?

33:24.122 --> 33:26.223
Nah.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.191
I think I'm gonna live a little.

33:28.259 --> 33:29.192
Side of yams.

33:29.260 --> 33:30.660
(chuckling)

33:30.728 --> 33:32.729
You hear anything about Joey?

33:32.797 --> 33:34.664
No, not Joey, but another boy.

33:34.732 --> 33:36.466
Cory... no one's seen him.

33:36.534 --> 33:38.702
How long has he been gone?

33:38.769 --> 33:41.071
Ever since he talked to you.

33:44.876 --> 33:46.309
I hope you're here to tell me

33:46.377 --> 33:48.879
you figured out Deputy Beck
is a solid officer.

33:48.946 --> 33:50.680
Grand jury judges character.

33:50.748 --> 33:52.282
I assemble facts.

33:52.350 --> 33:54.117
Facts used to put people
in front of the grand jury.

33:54.185 --> 33:56.987
Fair enough.

33:57.054 --> 33:59.856
By the way, someone with information

33:59.924 --> 34:01.658
about the Joey Campbell murder
has gone missing.

34:01.726 --> 34:02.926
A young kid named Cory.

34:02.994 --> 34:05.929
I thought you were here for Jesse Carr.

34:05.997 --> 34:07.497
Why are you looking at Joey Campbell?

34:07.565 --> 34:09.366
I was just in The Houses
getting statement signatures

34:09.433 --> 34:11.034
and someone brought it up, that's all.

34:11.101 --> 34:14.103
Son, don't burn the people
trying to help you.

34:14.172 --> 34:15.772
I'm not burning anyone.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.974
I'm just letting you know
a kid's missing.

34:18.042 --> 34:19.543
You don't walk into the boss's office

34:19.610 --> 34:21.277
and accuse him of not doing his job.

34:21.344 --> 34:24.014
So you do know Cory is missing?

34:26.250 --> 34:28.717
I'll tell you what.

34:28.786 --> 34:31.121
Write down the specifics
and I'll get into it.

34:33.424 --> 34:34.858
ASHE: So how you holding up?

34:34.926 --> 34:36.193
SHAMEEKA: All right, I guess.

34:36.260 --> 34:38.295
Taking care of Shawn helps, though.

34:38.362 --> 34:40.664
And who's taking care of you?

34:42.433 --> 34:44.734
Joey used to think it was
his job, taking care of me.

34:47.038 --> 34:49.406
Shawn takes care of me now,

34:49.473 --> 34:53.109
just by being himself, making me smile.

34:55.413 --> 34:56.413
Anyway.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.682
How about you?

34:58.749 --> 34:59.683
You got any babies?

34:59.750 --> 35:01.952
A daughter.

35:02.019 --> 35:03.587
Mm, a girl.

35:03.654 --> 35:05.522
Lucky.

35:05.590 --> 35:07.157
Keep her close.

35:10.394 --> 35:11.861
Can I ask you something?

35:18.269 --> 35:21.137
You, you said you heard
there were some witnesses.

35:21.205 --> 35:22.939
Have any come forward?

35:23.007 --> 35:26.676
Um, a lady named Kiana,
a few buildings over.

35:26.744 --> 35:29.179
Told some people she was there
when they took my boy.

35:29.247 --> 35:32.215
I went over there to talk
to her, but she moved out.

35:32.283 --> 35:34.117
Ain't say nothing to nobody.

35:34.185 --> 35:37.120
She just, just gone.

35:41.225 --> 35:43.159
(line rings)

35:43.227 --> 35:44.561
<i>It's Declan.</i>

35:44.629 --> 35:46.796
Hey, you speak to Javier's lawyer?

35:46.864 --> 35:48.298
<i>Yeah, he's not backing down.</i>

35:48.366 --> 35:50.856
(sighs) He's bluffing.

35:50.957 --> 35:53.137
<i>There's a court date set.</i>

35:53.227 --> 35:55.660
<i>Ashe, did you throw a
vase at his girlfriend?</i>

35:55.777 --> 35:58.074
I wasn't trying to hit her.

35:58.149 --> 35:59.430
I didn't hit her.

35:59.555 --> 36:00.906
<i>He's saying you refuse to get help</i>

36:01.008 --> 36:03.719
<i>for emotional trauma
you suffered on the job.</i>

36:03.981 --> 36:06.828
<i>He's seeking to characterize you
as an unfit mother.</i>

36:07.539 --> 36:10.420
<i>Listen to me, Ashe,
unless you show the court</i>

36:10.488 --> 36:12.227
<i>you're working to fix these issues,</i>

36:12.290 --> 36:13.723
<i>you're gonna lose your child.</i>

36:15.775 --> 36:17.075
<i>- Ashe, did you hear me?</i>
- (beep)

36:21.932 --> 36:23.600
PRESTON: What are you doing here?

36:23.668 --> 36:26.303
Came here to see you.

36:29.707 --> 36:32.008
How's Mace?

36:32.076 --> 36:33.643
Well, he'll bounce back.

36:33.711 --> 36:36.379
I'm sorry I didn't
make it to your party.

36:36.447 --> 36:38.014
I would've done the same for you.

36:38.082 --> 36:40.150
Your whole world revolves around Maceo.

36:41.919 --> 36:43.720
I seem to remember

36:43.788 --> 36:45.455
coming to all your high school games.

36:45.523 --> 36:49.459
A college recruiter sat in
our living room and said,

36:49.527 --> 36:52.632
"I expect to see you
in the World Series someday."

36:52.749 --> 36:54.616
I tend to think I had
something to do with that.

36:54.640 --> 36:55.779
You did.

36:55.804 --> 36:58.749
But I am the lead prosecutor
for the Department of Justice

36:58.827 --> 37:01.515
on a case that can impact
this entire town,

37:01.601 --> 37:03.306
maybe even the whole country.

37:03.374 --> 37:05.608
And I'm sorry I never chose
the path you chose for me,

37:05.676 --> 37:07.811
but this is the World Series.

37:10.581 --> 37:12.615
You kicked ass in school, Preston.

37:12.683 --> 37:16.586
I always knew that you were
going to put the books to use.

37:16.654 --> 37:18.621
But with your physical gifts,

37:18.689 --> 37:22.325
the suit and tie were supposed
to come after the rings.

37:22.393 --> 37:23.326
That was the plan.

37:23.394 --> 37:25.462
Not mine.

37:27.198 --> 37:29.799
I am so proud of you.

37:29.867 --> 37:33.136
Not just as my son, but as a man.

37:35.439 --> 37:38.867
But all due respect, Preston,

37:39.086 --> 37:42.045
there's only one World Series.

37:49.483 --> 37:51.764
Beck went through the academy
without incident.

37:51.866 --> 37:52.983
His best friend is white.

37:53.069 --> 37:56.491
In spite of the video,
Jesse's death wasn't about race.

38:00.328 --> 38:01.595
What if being the Jackie Robinson

38:01.662 --> 38:03.335
of the Gate Station Sheriff's Office

38:03.437 --> 38:05.835
wasn't everything
he thought it would be?

38:06.015 --> 38:07.735
Maybe when he shot the video,
he was joking,

38:07.783 --> 38:11.419
but after a couple years on the job,
his worldview changed.

38:11.487 --> 38:13.555
Your worldview change after Yale?

38:13.622 --> 38:15.890
Same as it was before.
The world is mine.

38:15.958 --> 38:19.961
Mm, Yale and <i>Illmatic.</i>
Don't see that every day.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.081
Your worldview change
after becoming a cop?

38:24.133 --> 38:25.600
It shifted.

38:27.436 --> 38:29.103
But what doesn't change

38:29.171 --> 38:32.040
is needing to be able
to trust your partner.

38:32.107 --> 38:34.275
You don't work another case
behind your partner's back.

38:34.343 --> 38:36.711
You questioned Sheriff Platt

38:36.779 --> 38:38.546
about a witness
in the Joey Campbell case,

38:38.614 --> 38:39.714
and he notified the bosses.

38:39.782 --> 38:41.082
What the hell were you thinking?

38:41.150 --> 38:43.818
I was thinking he'd notify the bosses.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.320
I don't have the clout

38:45.387 --> 38:46.988
to bring the Joey Campbell case
to them myself.

38:47.056 --> 38:49.557
So you got the sheriff
to get it on the books.

38:49.625 --> 38:52.427
I was banking on you covering for me.

38:52.595 --> 38:54.462
- That was risky.
- Not really.

38:54.530 --> 38:56.965
You questioned Shameeka behind my back.

38:57.032 --> 39:00.101
I called her 15 minutes after you left.

39:04.106 --> 39:05.707
(sighs) So now what?

39:05.774 --> 39:07.475
(sighs)

39:07.543 --> 39:11.012
I think Beck's a good cop
in a bad department.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.314
You think Beck shot Jesse over race.

39:13.382 --> 39:15.683
We need to work both cases:

39:15.751 --> 39:17.652
the case we were assigned to work

39:17.720 --> 39:19.621
and the case nobody wants to touch.

39:19.688 --> 39:23.024
May not be the best career move,
with your ass on the line and all.

39:27.896 --> 39:30.031
I'm in.

39:30.099 --> 39:31.633
Jesse's case and Joey's.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.068
No more going behind each other's backs.

39:34.136 --> 39:36.004
We have to trust each other.

You seen a kid named Cory,

who lives down the street?

40:25.921 --> 40:27.021
We're trying to find out

what really happened to Joey Campbell.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.063
- Y'all talk to Pastor Janae?
- Why?

40:34.186 --> 40:37.288
She patrols The Houses with some
of the dudes from her church.

40:37.457 --> 40:40.125
A few weeks ago,
she found out Joey was hustling,

40:40.569 --> 40:41.569
had him tuned up.

40:41.604 --> 40:43.271
She had them put hands on him?

Pastor.

40:59.321 --> 41:00.989
There's a Sarah Ellis on the phone.

41:01.056 --> 41:03.891
Says she works for Governor Eamons.

41:12.334 --> 41:14.168
