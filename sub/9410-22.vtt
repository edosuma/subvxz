16:16.067 --> 16:19.567
- That looks so fake. Nice try, Kim.
- Jeff, get back here!

16:19.567 --> 16:22.200
- What looks fake?
- [ Shawna ] That's not Kim.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.033
- [ Shuddering ]
- Jeff, stay back!

16:25.033 --> 16:28.733
- [ Groaning ]
- [ All Gasping ]

16:34.300 --> 16:37.567
Run!

16:45.600 --> 16:47.967
[ Mom ]
Jeffrey, run!

16:49.300 --> 16:52.200
Get downstairs!
Run!

16:56.567 --> 17:00.367
- Help! He's got me!
- Leave her alone!

17:12.433 --> 17:14.867
[ Both Scream ]

17:14.867 --> 17:16.867
Oh, my ankle.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.333
[ Jeff ]
Mom!

17:23.333 --> 17:25.833
- I'll be right back!
- Jeff!

17:26.333 --> 17:29.133
- Where are you going?
- Jeff!

17:38.867 --> 17:40.933
This can't be happening.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.433
Stand back!
I have the mummy dust!

17:49.433 --> 17:51.533
- You are in my power.
- [ Mom ] No, Jeff! No!

17:51.533 --> 17:54.133
It's okay, Mom.
I know what I'm doing.

17:54.133 --> 17:58.267
No, you don't. He wants his heart--
his heart that's in the jar!

17:58.267 --> 18:00.100
What for?

18:00.100 --> 18:02.533
Your father discovered an
inscription in the mummy's tomb.

18:02.533 --> 18:05.033
If this mummy gets his heart,
he'll demummify.

18:05.467 --> 18:08.367
- He'll become a living human again!
- A living human killer?

18:08.367 --> 18:11.900
- Here! Throw it to me!
- Run! Go get help!

18:11.900 --> 18:14.867
- We can't!
- Throw it here, quick!   - No.

18:14.867 --> 18:17.900
- He'll come after you.
- Jeff-- No!

18:19.367 --> 18:21.867
[ Mom ]
No!

18:21.867 --> 18:23.467
Kim, Shawna!
Come here!

18:25.000 --> 18:27.233
Jeff!

18:36.167 --> 18:38.633
[ Groaning ]

18:42.367 --> 18:45.733
The disposal!

18:45.733 --> 18:48.967
[ Mom ]
Oh, no! Don't, Jeff! No, don't!

18:50.967 --> 18:53.233
No, no!
Let him go!

18:53.233 --> 18:55.467
Stay back, Mom!
[ Straining ]

19:07.967 --> 19:09.900
[ Groaning ]

19:35.433 --> 19:37.367
[ Gasps ]

19:40.933 --> 19:43.433
Now, that's what I call mummy dust.

19:48.967 --> 19:52.600
I still don't get why
Dad sent the mummy here.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.600
Didn't he know there was
some kind of curse on it?

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
Of course he did.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.100
But he thought
it was just superstition.

19:58.100 --> 20:01.100
But I don't understand how
the mummy came back to life.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.600
According to legend,
he could only be revived...

20:03.600 --> 20:07.600
if someone opened the sarcophagus
and broke the sacred seal.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.600
Oops.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.100
At least one good
thing came out of it.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.600
I'm never gonna be afraid of
anything again as long as I live.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.600
Nothing can be scarier than that.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.600
That took a lot of guts,
little brother--

20:21.600 --> 20:24.100
yours and his.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.100
- [ Cat Meowing ]
- Oh, there's the neighbor's cat again.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.600
- I wish they'd keep the poor thing inside.
- She's probably just hungry.

20:30.600 --> 20:35.000
- Jeff, you shouldn't encourage her.
- Mom, she just wants a little.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.100
[ Groaning ]

20:43.667 --> 20:45.733
