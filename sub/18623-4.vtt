Er, we've booked this room. Sorry.

I don't think so, darling,
we've got this till half past.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.150
Well, it's nearly half past now, isn't it?

25:03.250 --> 25:05.150
So we don't mind you joining in,
do we, girls?

25:05.250 --> 25:08.200
No, I...I'm not quite sure
there's enough room for...

25:10.200 --> 25:12.150
So you're buying a bigger flat,
are you?

25:12.250 --> 25:15.150
What? No, of course not!

25:15.250 --> 25:18.150
I had to say that, didn't I,
otherwise it'd be suspicious.

25:18.250 --> 25:22.150
Just wait until the dust settles
and then I'll tell her tomorrow.
