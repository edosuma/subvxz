Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:24.092 --> 00:25.592
27.

00:25.594 --> 00:26.386
26.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.054
25.

00:29.013 --> 00:29.806
24.

00:31.017 --> 00:32.766
23.

00:32.768 --> 00:33.561
22.

00:35.104 --> 00:36.854
Deeper.

00:36.856 --> 00:39.898
Deeper still.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.358
Deep.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.737
With every breath.

00:43.739 --> 00:44.532
Drifting.

00:46.825 --> 00:47.617
21.

00:48.410 --> 00:49.202
20.

00:50.578 --> 00:56.795
Your mind, body, they
manifest success every moment.

00:58.547 --> 01:00.129
19.

01:00.131 --> 01:01.923
18.

01:01.925 --> 01:05.302
You are cut from
immaculate cloth.

01:05.929 --> 01:08.179
17.

01:08.181 --> 01:08.975
16.

01:10.142 --> 01:11.934
You subside deeper.

01:11.936 --> 01:17.440
You become abundance,
confidence.

01:18.193 --> 01:18.944
15.

01:19.944 --> 01:21.820
14.

01:21.822 --> 01:24.239
The Universe flows to you.

01:24.241 --> 01:27.578
You immerse yourself
in divine mission.

01:28.953 --> 01:30.663
Now stub it.

01:30.665 --> 01:33.166
And you're through.

01:33.168 --> 01:35.127
I'm through.

01:38.005 --> 01:40.130
Addiction
no longer defines you.

01:40.132 --> 01:42.092
So what will define you now?

01:42.094 --> 01:43.093
13.

01:43.095 --> 01:44.470
12.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.929
Subside into the cushions.

01:46.931 --> 01:50.976
Even now Holy Houses
have eyes for windows.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.979
Open those eyes for you.

01:55.900 --> 01:56.693
11.

01:57.569 --> 01:58.361
10.

01:59.946 --> 02:04.281
Even now forces you know
nothing of bring you the tools

02:04.283 --> 02:06.493
to make your way.

02:15.045 --> 02:18.381
What if
I die before I live?

02:18.383 --> 02:20.841
Never fear darkness.

02:20.843 --> 02:24.639
Its closest cousin
is serendipity.

02:25.641 --> 02:28.936
The World's
Greatest Fisherman.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.020
Wait.

02:31.022 --> 02:31.815
That's it?

02:33.023 --> 02:38.193
That was it?

02:38.195 --> 02:39.569
That was all?

02:39.571 --> 02:44.034
Ask instead
if you'll live before you die.

02:44.036 --> 02:47.039
For even now doors open.

02:48.749 --> 02:50.081
Nine.

02:50.083 --> 02:51.332
Eight.

02:51.334 --> 02:55.630
Even now mice work
mazes for you.

02:55.632 --> 02:56.964
Seven.

02:56.966 --> 02:58.173
Six.

02:58.175 --> 03:01.052
Even now your star ascends.

03:01.054 --> 03:05.223
Even now you align with
other bodies of heaven.

03:05.225 --> 03:07.645
Even now your familiars dig.

03:08.770 --> 03:13.107
Even now the hour pushes in.

03:13.109 --> 03:16.734
Even now destiny taps its foot.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.265
It's too much.

03:43.267 --> 03:45.016
No, put...

03:45.018 --> 03:47.311
Put half back.

03:47.313 --> 03:48.312
This is way more.

03:48.314 --> 03:50.480
This is too much.

03:50.482 --> 03:51.691
Put half back.

03:52.775 --> 03:53.569
Smalls?

03:56.989 --> 03:59.282
Even now fate
leans against the brick wall

03:59.284 --> 04:01.200
on the corner.

04:01.202 --> 04:02.993
Awaits you.

04:02.995 --> 04:04.204
Five.

04:04.206 --> 04:05.497
Four.

04:05.499 --> 04:06.916
Three.

04:06.918 --> 04:07.707
Two.

04:07.709 --> 04:09.125
One.

04:09.127 --> 04:09.921
Eyes open.

04:11.005 --> 04:12.921
But not awake.

04:12.923 --> 04:13.715
Not yet.

04:21.558 --> 04:25.771
Strange dream you're having.

04:29.398 --> 04:30.899
Without waking...

04:30.901 --> 04:32.567
Without motion...

04:32.569 --> 04:36.238
Without lifting a limb,
without lifting a foot,

04:36.240 --> 04:37.533
you will now run.

04:38.742 --> 04:41.744
And as you run you
will become legion,

04:41.746 --> 04:43.914
you will become numerous,

04:43.916 --> 04:47.167
you will become all the
many yous there are.

04:47.169 --> 04:50.837
First you are one,
then you are two,

04:50.839 --> 04:55.052
you are three, you are four,
you are five, six, seven...

05:04.728 --> 05:06.856
Want
a piñata for $20?

05:06.858 --> 05:08.690
It's full of
candy, though, right?

05:08.692 --> 05:10.609
You would put candy in it.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.111
But for $20 it would
already have the candy.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.404
What kind of
piñata would it be

05:14.406 --> 05:17.323
if you didn't choose the candy?

05:17.325 --> 05:20.244
Could I pay half now and
maybe half in a couple of...

05:20.246 --> 05:23.122
40 is 40, unless
you want the piñata.

05:24.376 --> 05:26.378
No, I can't eat sugar.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.591
One.

05:32.593 --> 05:33.385
Two.

05:34.596 --> 05:36.137
Three.

05:36.139 --> 05:36.930
Four.

05:37.807 --> 05:38.600
Five.

05:39.516 --> 05:40.310
Six...

05:41.519 --> 05:44.979
Even in
these teeming masses,

05:44.981 --> 05:49.400
even with deliberation,
you crest ahead

05:49.402 --> 05:51.446
of all those who are still.

05:52.823 --> 05:53.616
Go.

05:54.742 --> 05:55.659
Divide now.

05:56.912 --> 05:58.413
Divide and conquer.

06:00.372 --> 06:01.456
Just so you know they're going

06:01.458 --> 06:04.082
to be pissed this
is your headshot.

06:04.084 --> 06:07.378
Look
to the celestial.

06:07.380 --> 06:10.465
You are many shards
of all you can see.

06:10.467 --> 06:12.510
Plus I'm SAG now!

06:12.512 --> 06:14.137
SAG-AFTRA!

06:15.347 --> 06:19.350
Without you,
the stars would not operate.

06:19.352 --> 06:20.935
You're going to have
to leave it, sweetie,

06:20.937 --> 06:22.437
he's in an emergency.

06:22.439 --> 06:24.439
That's terrible, I've...

06:24.441 --> 06:25.357
Is everything okay?

06:25.359 --> 06:26.775
Give me the fucking headshot.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.901
You're like butter, but
not what I'm looking for.

06:28.903 --> 06:30.863
You're like honey, but
not what I'm looking for.

06:30.865 --> 06:32.572
It's just not the deal here.

06:32.574 --> 06:33.575
That's fine.

06:38.413 --> 06:40.541
You.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.254
We don't have time for you.

07:01.730 --> 07:04.356
Even in
suffocation the landscape...

07:04.358 --> 07:06.109
- Fuck!
- Stretches forever.

07:06.111 --> 07:09.446
Fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

07:09.448 --> 07:11.448
You smell of fear, Pris.

07:11.450 --> 07:13.159
You go into an audition
smelling like anything

07:13.161 --> 07:16.162
besides perfume and my
very best machinations

07:16.164 --> 07:17.496
won't save you.

07:17.498 --> 07:20.542
But they call me in
and they don't see me.

07:22.170 --> 07:24.420
I'm a phantom in the system.

07:24.422 --> 07:26.589
The key word there is Phantom.

07:26.591 --> 07:28.800
But this has happened
four times now,

07:28.802 --> 07:31.512
where they call me in,
they take one look at me,

07:31.514 --> 07:32.430
and they don't see me.

07:32.432 --> 07:33.681
They cancel me.

07:33.683 --> 07:37.226
Maybe I'm not the
guy to be telling that.

07:37.228 --> 07:40.438
What I mean is I love you.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.566
I'll work the thriller
angle with a ratchet.

07:42.568 --> 07:44.817
For that you can bring fear.

07:44.819 --> 07:46.653
You know what a
ratchet is, right?

07:46.655 --> 07:51.115
Yeah, a ratchet, I can
ratchet, I'll ratchet.

07:51.117 --> 07:53.494
All right, you gotta
stop sweating desperation

07:53.496 --> 07:56.330
and start sweating Come hither.

07:56.332 --> 07:57.373
Except for the
thriller audition,

07:57.375 --> 07:59.918
for that you can
sweat desperation.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.378
Oh, and next time
make an appointment.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.965
Silence of self-assurance.

08:05.967 --> 08:09.763
Like space you expand.

08:10.263 --> 08:12.057
Feel the ocean inside.

08:13.392 --> 08:17.606
Every ounce of you hungry,
not for food,

08:18.023 --> 08:20.025
but for sustenance.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.569
And there is no plateau.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.279
There is no evenness.

08:27.281 --> 08:30.160
There is no exactitude.

08:30.620 --> 08:32.953
And five,

08:32.956 --> 08:34.455
four,

08:34.457 --> 08:35.250
three,

08:36.125 --> 08:37.457
two,

08:37.460 --> 08:40.544
one...

08:40.547 --> 08:41.339
Awake.

08:46.094 --> 08:48.010
What are you chopping?

08:48.012 --> 08:48.805
Onion.

08:50.057 --> 08:51.264
How big is the knife?

08:51.266 --> 08:53.768
Be careful, I don't
want you hurt.

08:53.770 --> 08:55.352
Mm-hm.

08:55.354 --> 08:59.606
Your
mother and I have been talking.

08:59.608 --> 09:03.528
She isn't up for much in
terms of talking but...

09:03.530 --> 09:05.488
I'd love to say hello.

09:05.490 --> 09:07.533
She
thinks I'll burn down the yard

09:07.535 --> 09:10.202
if she doesn't watch the leaves.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.453
I rake them, she
watches them burn.

09:12.455 --> 09:15.583
She can't even pay much
attention at the shop, Pris.

09:15.585 --> 09:19.628
She gave wrong change at
least a dozen times yesterday.

09:19.630 --> 09:24.258
You're still thinking hard
about coming home, yeah?

09:24.260 --> 09:25.052
Mm?

09:29.475 --> 09:30.268
I...

09:32.728 --> 09:34.938
I wasn't sure.

09:35.523 --> 09:40.484
You
said just five years of this.

09:40.486 --> 09:41.695
What's it been now?

09:41.697 --> 09:47.366
I had a great meeting, um...

09:47.368 --> 09:50.620
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

09:50.622 --> 09:56.627
I met with this agent who
represents all-these A-listers,

09:56.629 --> 09:59.755
and he said I was Shiny.

09:59.757 --> 10:02.634
He said that, about
me, I'm Shiny.

10:02.636 --> 10:03.760
Uh-huh.

10:03.762 --> 10:07.430
No, we're not shiny
here, I'm afraid.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.018
We're all getting old and dying.

10:11.561 --> 10:15.233
That's a little bit too
much existentialism, Daddy.

10:16.691 --> 10:22.405
So, uh...

10:22.407 --> 10:28.161
Would you be able to put
that 500 in my account...

10:28.163 --> 10:30.457
By like the 27th?

10:33.752 --> 10:35.710
What
you don't want in The Industry

10:35.712 --> 10:38.047
is an almost-but-not-quite job

10:38.049 --> 10:41.008
because you're siphoning energy.

10:41.010 --> 10:43.846
Restaurants are the
greatest invention ever made

10:43.848 --> 10:45.346
for out-of-work actors.

10:45.348 --> 10:47.640
Remote from acting with
the bare essentials

10:47.642 --> 10:49.643
of acting inherent, okay?

10:49.645 --> 10:54.481
But you work, for example, as
a receptionist for an agency?

10:54.483 --> 10:56.568
You're fucked!

10:56.570 --> 10:58.569
Can I say Fucked on here?

10:58.571 --> 11:01.238
Just this once.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.158
You're fucked!

11:14.547 --> 11:16.796
He's got no compunction.

11:16.798 --> 11:18.340
Got no conscience.

11:18.342 --> 11:19.135
No guilt.

11:20.220 --> 11:21.805
He just does things.

11:22.597 --> 11:24.222
He just does them.

11:24.224 --> 11:27.809
Look at how he eats eggs.

11:27.811 --> 11:28.769
It's glorious.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.647
Kiss the sun.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.984
Go on, go on, go on,
they're not watching.

11:38.072 --> 11:38.865
Good boy.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.159
Good boy.

11:42.077 --> 11:48.332
See, he does what I tell him.

11:48.334 --> 11:49.750
Yeah, but he's right.

11:49.752 --> 11:53.587
We're not partial to
your secret codes.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.883
What are you talking about?

11:58.512 --> 11:59.885
You know what?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.013
I don't care.

12:02.224 --> 12:05.603
Your job is to poach the eggs.

12:06.811 --> 12:12.065
My job is to protect the
eggs from the poacher,

12:12.067 --> 12:15.902
so that we have enough eggs to
use when we get to the thing

12:15.904 --> 12:17.656
that we poached the
eggs for to be...

12:17.658 --> 12:19.657
I'm so sorry
that this is late.

12:19.659 --> 12:21.033
I...

12:21.035 --> 12:22.493
Sunshine!

12:22.495 --> 12:23.411
Good morning!

12:23.413 --> 12:25.455
Good morning.

12:25.457 --> 12:27.123
We didn't even see you
when we came in.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.877
I was in back probably.

12:29.879 --> 12:34.133
You know, you are
a diamond amongst us.

12:35.467 --> 12:36.884
Thank you.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.552
Otherwise why would we come
to this damn place every day?

12:39.347 --> 12:41.055
Got banana syrup yet?

12:41.057 --> 12:44.559
Uh, just
regular syrup, we always have.

12:44.561 --> 12:47.604
Well, for future reference.

12:47.606 --> 12:52.817
I'm going to tell her.

12:52.819 --> 12:55.737
Come here.

12:55.739 --> 12:59.952
We are opening an All-American
Supper Club in New York.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.121
You ever think about
moving to New York?

13:04.123 --> 13:05.290
Oh, uh...

13:05.292 --> 13:06.666
Sometimes, I...

13:06.668 --> 13:07.917
You're
an actress, right?

13:07.919 --> 13:08.669
Bingo!

13:09.964 --> 13:13.424
This All-American Supper
Club is going to sit

13:13.426 --> 13:15.511
on top of its skyscraper.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.889
And it's going to
overlook Broadway.

13:19.891 --> 13:21.016
Ah.

13:21.018 --> 13:22.351
The Broadway.

13:23.728 --> 13:28.105
Not just some other street with
the same name that stole it.

13:28.107 --> 13:33.738
And if you come and work
for us, I will make sure

13:33.740 --> 13:38.951
that you can go audition
downstairs whenever.

13:38.953 --> 13:42.956
I mean, who wants Hollywood
when you can trod the boards?

13:42.958 --> 13:44.790
And I know the guy
that runs this place,

13:44.792 --> 13:46.210
he doesn't let you out
for auditions, I know.

13:46.212 --> 13:48.712
No, no, no, no, no, he does.

13:48.714 --> 13:51.088
But not like I would.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.967
Oh, it sounds lovely.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.888
Will you come?

13:57.724 --> 13:58.932
Yeah, yeah.

13:58.934 --> 13:59.723
Oh!

13:59.725 --> 14:01.601
That sounds...

14:01.603 --> 14:03.394
That sounds really nice.

14:03.396 --> 14:04.478
Okay.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.814
Okay.

14:05.816 --> 14:09.818
This woman is a Hope
Diamond all of you,

14:09.820 --> 14:14.033
so get your faces out of
your eggs and pay attention.

14:14.908 --> 14:19.204
You'll learn something from her.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.791
She's going to come.

14:22.292 --> 14:24.209
Tell the customer I can
fit five bananas in a blender

14:24.211 --> 14:25.877
if that's what he wants.

14:25.879 --> 14:27.586
Otherwise tell him what he
thought was banana syrup,

14:27.588 --> 14:29.923
that one time he had it,
was nothing but yellow dye

14:29.925 --> 14:31.801
with a flavor
constructed in a lab.

14:31.803 --> 14:32.969
I could just leave it alone.

14:32.971 --> 14:34.848
You could just do that.

14:39.227 --> 14:41.144
There's the puppy.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.062
What?

14:42.064 --> 14:43.813
The husband that I deserve.

14:43.815 --> 14:47.067
At least you can look
at him without laughing.

14:47.069 --> 14:48.443
And there's worse.

14:48.445 --> 14:51.279
Yeah, like mortgage brokers.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.532
He doesn't watch
football, he said.

14:53.534 --> 14:54.534
He smokes.

14:54.536 --> 14:55.993
I just quit.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.953
That's
just him humphreying.

14:57.955 --> 15:00.205
If only this place
was called Bacall's.

15:00.207 --> 15:03.041
I
need a power broker.

15:03.043 --> 15:04.376
You just
said "No brokers."

15:04.378 --> 15:06.589
I said "No mortgage brokers."

15:06.591 --> 15:09.007
So a bun in the
oven by a producer?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.343
A power producer.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.262
The pregnancy
part is the wash.

15:13.264 --> 15:18.849
That'd be that, no
matter who the dick is.

15:18.851 --> 15:19.853
He's
just a mechanic.

15:19.855 --> 15:22.022
A mechanic
could pay your rent.

15:22.024 --> 15:24.481
He's not even a writer.

15:24.483 --> 15:26.401
I went out with a writer.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.527
That was as exciting as
living in a world of fiction

15:28.529 --> 15:31.157
by the person doing
the fictionalizing.

15:31.159 --> 15:34.326
I'm marrying an A-list agent,

15:34.328 --> 15:39.664
or an A-list exec, or at the
very least a decent publicist.

15:39.666 --> 15:40.707
Mm-hm.

15:40.709 --> 15:43.087
Well, for now go fill his cup.

15:45.382 --> 15:46.175
Go on.

15:56.686 --> 15:59.686
Your love story
is written by the Universe,

15:59.688 --> 16:01.689
not by Hollywood.

16:01.691 --> 16:02.942
Not by committee.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.863
The Universe delivers success
to those who trust it.

16:08.865 --> 16:10.907
Be sure your ears are pricked.

16:10.909 --> 16:14.244
Priscilla?

16:14.246 --> 16:16.747
The
knock will come.

16:16.749 --> 16:18.082
Listen.

16:18.084 --> 16:18.876
Listen.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.506
Listening always for that knock.

16:27.093 --> 16:28.843
Bad things do occur.

16:28.845 --> 16:30.513
This is Los Angeles.

16:30.515 --> 16:33.057
In all corners, shadows persist.

16:33.059 --> 16:36.143
Sooner or later, you're
going to receive a beatdown.

16:41.442 --> 16:45.655
As our name spiels, we won't
sugarcoat your insurance needs.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.116
Bad things do occur.

16:49.118 --> 16:50.992
This is Los Angeles.

16:50.994 --> 16:53.537
In all corners, shadows persist.

16:53.539 --> 16:56.248
Sooner or later, you're
going to receive a beatdown.

17:21.486 --> 17:24.195
Were you out of
bed last night?

17:24.198 --> 17:26.070
Talk to Daddy before
Mommy gets to the bottom

17:26.073 --> 17:27.159
of her glass.

17:28.701 --> 17:30.410
I just want to know if you
were out of bed last night

17:30.412 --> 17:32.787
when Mommy and Daddy were gone.

17:32.789 --> 17:34.290
When Nanna was here.

17:34.292 --> 17:37.253
Was anybody here
besides Nanna?

17:40.089 --> 17:42.131
He's keeping his corner, huh?

17:42.133 --> 17:45.384
All right, Bobby,
you're not in trouble

17:45.386 --> 17:47.512
if you were out of your
bed and you saw someone

17:47.514 --> 17:51.307
besides Nanna in the
house, all right?

17:51.309 --> 17:53.186
You're not in trouble.

17:53.188 --> 17:53.939
Not for now.

17:58.442 --> 17:59.901
Okay.

17:59.903 --> 18:00.694
Come here.

18:10.248 --> 18:11.997
I'm going to eat these cookies.

18:11.999 --> 18:13.915
One at a time I'm
going to eat them.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.543
If you tell me if
you saw someone,

18:15.545 --> 18:17.045
I'll stop eating
and give the rest

18:17.047 --> 18:19.130
of the cookies to
you, all right?

18:19.132 --> 18:22.092
Were you out of
bed last night?

18:25.137 --> 18:27.137
Mm, these are good.

18:27.139 --> 18:29.267
Want some milk?

18:29.269 --> 18:31.434
No, they're too delicious.

18:31.436 --> 18:32.728
Probably they're so good

18:32.730 --> 18:35.356
you don't want to
ruin them with milk.

18:35.358 --> 18:37.650
God, they're that good.

18:37.652 --> 18:38.567
Hm?

18:38.569 --> 18:41.154
Who was in the house last night?

18:41.156 --> 18:42.073
Uncaraff!

18:43.576 --> 18:45.533
Uncle Ralph?

18:45.535 --> 18:46.411
Uncaraff.

18:47.745 --> 18:49.370
Uncle Ralph.

18:49.372 --> 18:51.290
Uncaraff.

18:51.292 --> 18:52.290
Are you sure?

18:52.292 --> 18:53.542
Yeah!

18:53.544 --> 18:54.336
Uncaraff!

18:58.425 --> 19:00.258
Never be a rat, Bobby.

19:15.234 --> 19:16.274
Hello?

19:16.276 --> 19:17.776
Ready to steam?

19:17.778 --> 19:19.111
Uh, sure.

19:19.113 --> 19:20.821
Got a
one o'clock for you.

19:20.823 --> 19:21.656
Minor role.

19:21.658 --> 19:22.782
Has potential.

19:22.784 --> 19:24.033
You can do fear, right?

19:24.035 --> 19:24.825
Fear?

19:24.827 --> 19:25.619
Yeah!

19:25.621 --> 19:26.535
Fear.

19:26.537 --> 19:28.956
And also steam, Pris.

19:28.958 --> 19:29.748
Steam.

19:29.750 --> 19:30.541
Yeah!

19:30.543 --> 19:31.878
Fear and steam.

19:34.463 --> 19:35.963
You want the
supper club or not?

19:35.965 --> 19:37.215
Of course I want
the supper club.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.424
Why are you talking
about this here?

19:38.426 --> 19:39.967
I need to know.

19:39.969 --> 19:41.428
I gotta get the money, I
gotta tell them these things.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.345
They're on my ass.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.346
What do you think's gonna...

19:43.348 --> 19:45.015
Hello.

19:52.817 --> 19:53.982
No.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.277
Makes me nervous.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.780
How about you?

20:01.284 --> 20:02.616
Okay.

20:08.209 --> 20:09.835
It's about time
you fucking tell.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.128
Don't you go fascist on me.

20:14.839 --> 20:15.882
All right.

20:17.552 --> 20:23.849
Apple jacks are down
The Rabbit Hole...

20:26.103 --> 20:27.771
Out back of The Neon.

20:30.441 --> 20:32.983
Okay, Tango Foxtrot Niner.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.237
Now you be quiet,
the walls have ears.

20:36.239 --> 20:39.701
This woman
of women we have here.

20:42.996 --> 20:47.000
Apple jacks
are down the Rabbit Hole

20:48.752 --> 20:50.421
out back of The Neon.

20:55.802 --> 20:58.802
You just going
to leave that sitting there?

20:58.804 --> 21:00.512
It was bugging
me, sitting on it.

21:00.514 --> 21:01.931
Well,
don't chip the counter.

21:01.933 --> 21:03.390
I won't.

21:03.392 --> 21:06.896
Don't mistake it for your
fork, it can stick in your eggs.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.481
Don't you have to
go to work today?

21:09.483 --> 21:11.233
They don't have anything
for me until noon.

21:11.235 --> 21:12.568
So what?

21:12.570 --> 21:14.277
You're just going to sit
around here all morning?

21:14.279 --> 21:16.864
Oh, I got to absorb that
lovely breakfast you made

21:16.866 --> 21:18.075
into my cells.

21:19.702 --> 21:20.493
Cook makes it.

21:20.495 --> 21:22.078
I'm just a waitress.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.287
Not just.

21:23.289 --> 21:24.872
You're an actress, right?

21:24.874 --> 21:26.416
You act, you...

21:26.418 --> 21:28.587
What's your real hair color?

21:33.383 --> 21:34.176
Peach.

21:36.386 --> 21:39.346
See, I can't imagine that.

21:39.348 --> 21:41.059
Then keep dreaming.

21:44.395 --> 21:47.022
Can you cover today?

21:47.024 --> 21:48.523
That leaves
me with half of lunch.

21:48.525 --> 21:50.319
Yeah, but only that.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.655
I gotta be out of here by two.

21:54.657 --> 21:56.490
How about three?

21:56.492 --> 21:57.659
Please.

21:57.661 --> 21:58.992
2:30.

21:58.994 --> 21:59.787
Okay.

22:02.665 --> 22:03.664
I don't know about
this project, I mean,

22:03.666 --> 22:05.541
am I right for this part?

22:05.543 --> 22:07.420
Am I the thriller type?

22:08.297 --> 22:10.422
What else you got?

22:10.424 --> 22:11.632
Right.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.008
Opportunity.

22:13.010 --> 22:14.551
Opportunities
of your difficulties.

22:14.553 --> 22:16.303
Opportunities of
my difficulties.

22:16.305 --> 22:17.221
All right.

22:17.223 --> 22:18.973
Take them or stay afraid.

22:27.233 --> 22:28.901
Did you do it perfect?

22:28.903 --> 22:29.695
Yes.

22:37.579 --> 22:38.370
Rosie!

22:40.164 --> 22:41.166
Thank you!

22:44.712 --> 22:46.086
Where's she going?

22:54.054 --> 22:55.346
You fucked me!

22:55.348 --> 22:56.558
You fucked me!

23:01.478 --> 23:05.275
Apple jacks behind The
Neon down the Rabbit...

23:08.528 --> 23:09.863
The Rabbit Hole.

23:11.407 --> 23:13.407
We saw him at the carnival
beside The Ferris Wheel!

23:13.409 --> 23:16.284
We saw him at the fish market!

23:16.286 --> 23:17.454
It's the same man.

23:17.456 --> 23:19.082
It's the same man.

23:43.067 --> 23:44.357
It's all bullshit.

23:44.359 --> 23:45.525
They put the door
way across to there.

23:45.527 --> 23:47.068
And we all entered from there,

23:47.070 --> 23:49.528
so they already have us
walking in a fucking triangle.

23:49.530 --> 23:52.114
Do I know you from that bar?

23:52.116 --> 23:53.284
"Stacks"?

23:53.286 --> 23:55.286
Legs in a bundle of hosiery,

23:55.288 --> 23:57.579
like we're chopping firewood
instead of being human women.

23:57.581 --> 24:00.960
Do you know a bar
called The Neon, Neon?

24:15.559 --> 24:18.605
I think you're
supposed to sign this.

24:20.439 --> 24:22.106
Perth.

24:22.108 --> 24:22.900
Me.

24:23.944 --> 24:24.735
Junebug.

24:28.406 --> 24:31.367
Priscilla, um, Anders.

24:31.369 --> 24:32.867
I'm new here.

24:32.869 --> 24:34.662
No friends.

24:34.664 --> 24:38.749
Well, welcome to the part
where you have no friends,

24:38.751 --> 24:41.502
and no parents,
and no movie roles,

24:41.504 --> 24:44.925
and no commercial
roles, and no nothing.

24:47.218 --> 24:49.470
It's nice and sunny, but...

24:51.764 --> 24:53.224
Um...

24:53.226 --> 24:56.602
In Australia do you have slang

24:56.604 --> 24:58.980
for something
called Apple jacks?

24:58.982 --> 25:00.481
Isn't that a kid's cereal?

25:00.483 --> 25:01.443
How about...

25:02.986 --> 25:07.531
Apple jacks down the Rabbit
Hole in the back of Neon?

25:07.533 --> 25:08.784
Is that like...

25:10.452 --> 25:13.704
Slide down my rainbow

25:13.706 --> 25:15.997
Into my cellar door?

25:40.778 --> 25:43.404
Who has stolen my clipboard?

25:48.452 --> 25:50.744
You know in your many hearts

25:50.746 --> 25:53.708
that fortune sides
with she who dares.

25:58.712 --> 26:04.174
Neon.

26:04.176 --> 26:07.264
Well, that's right
around the corner.

26:08.515 --> 26:25.699
Stop talking to yourself.

26:25.701 --> 26:26.493
Hey!

26:28.369 --> 26:31.246
Huh, the Rams'
next wide receiver.

26:31.248 --> 26:33.206
Did you just call me Wide?

26:33.208 --> 26:35.751
No, I meant like in football.

26:35.753 --> 26:37.587
Oh, I look like
a football player?

26:37.589 --> 26:39.713
No, sorry, Rosie.

26:39.715 --> 26:42.759
No, that was a great catch.

26:42.761 --> 26:43.553
Sorry.

26:46.764 --> 26:48.639
You're
seriously tardy.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.975
I was playing detective.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.103
What's wrong with your eyes?

26:53.105 --> 26:55.314
Oh, get off me!

26:55.316 --> 26:57.609
Seriously, did you take
advantage of my generosity

26:57.611 --> 26:58.650
and stop for a session?

26:58.652 --> 27:01.904
No, I was out
solving a mystery.

27:01.906 --> 27:03.697
Life's mysteries.

27:03.699 --> 27:05.242
You!

27:05.244 --> 27:07.035
You know things.

27:07.037 --> 27:08.704
What're Apple jacks?

27:08.706 --> 27:09.746
It's a kid's cereal.

27:09.748 --> 27:12.166
No, no, no, I mean the slang?

27:12.168 --> 27:13.458
Money.

27:13.460 --> 27:16.210
As in Money?

27:16.212 --> 27:19.256
Apples, like Golden Delicious,

27:19.258 --> 27:23.637
like Granny Smith's, like
a stack of $100 bills.

27:23.639 --> 27:26.805
And Jacks, like
To the nth power,

27:26.807 --> 27:30.853
like dropping and
picking up lots of money.

27:30.855 --> 27:32.438
Apple jacks.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.230
And I'm from the street,
so I know these things.

27:34.232 --> 27:35.024
Huh!

27:35.026 --> 27:36.942
Yeah, He's street.

27:36.944 --> 27:40.740
Come on, Bus Girl, help
me clear these tables.

27:42.158 --> 27:43.741
What's
a Rabbit Hole?

27:43.743 --> 27:45.035
A place for bunnies?

27:45.037 --> 27:47.871
No, no, no, the slang?

27:47.873 --> 27:48.747
I don't know.

27:48.749 --> 27:49.998
Sounds iffy to me.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.874
And I'm not into
that kind of stuff.

27:51.876 --> 27:52.919
I am a married man.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.753
You mean
you're married to a man.

27:54.755 --> 27:56.381
What the fuck
you say that for?

27:56.383 --> 27:57.798
You are.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.092
What difference
does that make?

27:59.094 --> 28:01.051
Better get some fucking
sensitivity training in here.

28:01.053 --> 28:02.804
I don't know any
fucking Rabbit Holes!

28:02.806 --> 28:06.099
Priscilla, sorry,
could I see you?

28:06.101 --> 28:07.183
I got tables.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.184
I'm sorry.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.103
Two minutes.

28:09.105 --> 28:10.229
I'm sorry.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.897
I wanna...

28:12.899 --> 28:13.773
Come in.

28:13.775 --> 28:14.732
Sit.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.067
Sit, please.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.155
Take a chair.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.825
Okay.

28:21.827 --> 28:23.492
How are you?

28:23.494 --> 28:24.536
How you doing?

28:24.538 --> 28:25.662
I'm okay.

28:25.664 --> 28:27.414
Are you okay?

28:27.416 --> 28:28.541
No.

28:28.543 --> 28:29.833
God, no.

28:29.835 --> 28:33.128
No, Cilla, nothing's
okay, how could it be?

28:33.130 --> 28:36.424
Are you still spending all your
money getting brainwashed?!

28:36.426 --> 28:38.759
Hypnotherapy.

28:38.761 --> 28:39.803
Hypnotherapy.

28:40.930 --> 28:43.976
Ever notice that
people don't eat here?

28:45.476 --> 28:49.646
We are locked in this dead zone
between Magnolia and Olive,

28:49.648 --> 28:52.609
where people can't
get lunch here

28:52.611 --> 28:56.486
but they can go down two
blocks, to Russell's.

28:56.488 --> 28:59.407
Have you ever seen Russell's
Diner during lunch?

28:59.409 --> 29:00.658
No.

29:00.660 --> 29:02.200
It's packed.

29:02.202 --> 29:05.538
And who the fuck is Russell?!

29:05.540 --> 29:06.873
A Hollywood legend?

29:06.875 --> 29:07.916
Like Marilyn?

29:07.918 --> 29:09.001
No.

29:09.003 --> 29:11.128
Just some asshole
who's killing me.

29:11.130 --> 29:13.632
And I have to cut your hours.

29:15.426 --> 29:16.843
Wait...

29:16.845 --> 29:18.053
What?

29:18.055 --> 29:19.929
I'm sorry, but
between you and Rosie,

29:19.931 --> 29:22.056
you're the one who goes
out the most on auditions

29:22.058 --> 29:24.558
even though it's so weird
because she's so talented,

29:24.560 --> 29:25.810
so beautiful, like Marilyn,
but that's why I have

29:25.812 --> 29:27.938
to cut your hours,
and I hope that's okay

29:27.940 --> 29:29.774
because there's so many
more restaurants better

29:29.776 --> 29:30.941
than this one.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.485
What kind of cut?

29:32.487 --> 29:34.236
You can still work
that one Saturday shift

29:34.238 --> 29:37.448
and then you'll have all
the weekdays for auditions.

29:37.450 --> 29:38.740
Oh, you know what?

29:38.742 --> 29:40.911
You can just drive
your car, you know,

29:40.913 --> 29:42.412
that thing where you go
pick up drunks in bars?

30:24.001 --> 30:26.084
Rosie said that
you towed my car.

30:26.086 --> 30:27.711
Yeah, yeah, I did.

30:27.713 --> 30:29.839
I'm sort of in
charge over there,

30:29.841 --> 30:31.131
or they think I'm in charge

30:31.133 --> 30:32.300
because I'm the
most responsible.

30:32.302 --> 30:34.010
What's the damage?

30:34.012 --> 30:35.386
Um...

30:35.388 --> 30:37.096
I think it's 700 bucks.

30:37.098 --> 30:37.889
$700.

30:39.684 --> 30:40.769
Uh...

30:42.146 --> 30:43.477
That's a month's rent.

30:43.479 --> 30:44.937
That's the worst
case scenario.

30:44.939 --> 30:48.318
What the fuck part
of a car costs $700?!

30:49.695 --> 30:51.611
I'm not going to let
them charge you labor.

30:51.613 --> 30:54.325
So, maybe we do
a trade, for a...

30:55.785 --> 30:56.660
For a date?

31:00.623 --> 31:04.042
You fix my car,
I go out with you?

31:04.044 --> 31:06.586
No, I don't mean it
like that, I mean like...

31:06.588 --> 31:08.714
What, you blackmail
me for car repairs?

31:08.716 --> 31:10.256
I swear, I didn't
mean it like that.

31:10.258 --> 31:14.011
I meant, like, as a funny
way to ask someone out.

31:14.013 --> 31:15.306
You know, like...

31:46.005 --> 31:48.714
Apple jacks...

31:48.716 --> 31:52.720
Are down the Rabbit Hole...

31:52.722 --> 31:54.432
Out back of The Neon.

31:57.476 --> 32:00.603
As long as you promise that
you're not trying to seduce me

32:00.605 --> 32:01.980
for automotive motives.

32:01.982 --> 32:02.771
No.

32:02.773 --> 32:04.567
Because I hate cars.

32:07.112 --> 32:09.532
Yeah, yeah, yeah, screw cars.

32:11.951 --> 32:13.283
Except when you open them up,

32:13.285 --> 32:14.993
you know, you get
to see the inside.

32:14.995 --> 32:17.579
And then...

32:17.581 --> 32:18.708
Kind of nice.

32:19.917 --> 32:21.794
But, on the street, no.

32:23.379 --> 32:25.004
You go clubbing?

32:25.006 --> 32:26.966
I dance like a mechanic.

32:30.429 --> 32:32.222
Pick me up at three.

32:34.684 --> 32:36.099
Uh...

32:36.101 --> 32:37.019
Actually...

32:38.187 --> 32:40.482
My car's on the block, too.

32:41.816 --> 32:43.774
A mechanic without a car.

32:43.776 --> 32:46.402
I know, I know.

32:46.404 --> 32:47.196
Okay.

32:49.158 --> 32:49.949
Okay.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.909
Hey, Rosie!

33:14.309 --> 33:17.146
Ah, yeah, okay,
it's spoons on top.

33:18.315 --> 33:20.356
Forks, they're on the left.

33:20.358 --> 33:22.525
And the knives at some...

33:22.527 --> 33:23.776
No, wait, that's not it.

33:23.778 --> 33:25.653
Spoons are stupid.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.952
Forks on the left,
spoons on the right.

33:30.161 --> 33:31.911
And the knife should be
right in front of you

33:31.913 --> 33:36.498
because you got to
get to it quicker.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.875
What're you doing?

33:38.877 --> 33:39.878
Down here.

33:41.173 --> 33:42.967
But it's over there.

33:44.342 --> 33:46.093
This is my shortcut.

33:48.513 --> 33:50.430
But it's right there!

33:50.432 --> 33:52.227
This way's quickest.

34:14.208 --> 34:28.306
Come here!

34:36.982 --> 34:38.565
Nice job, baby.

34:38.567 --> 34:39.357
Thanks.

34:39.359 --> 34:40.985
Here you go.

34:41.987 --> 34:43.322
Come on.

34:43.324 --> 34:44.487
Okay.

34:44.489 --> 34:45.284
All right.

34:58.172 --> 35:03.592
A little early for
clubbing, don't you think?

35:03.594 --> 35:04.387
Down here?

35:09.268 --> 35:13.354
Am I ever going to see
your real hair color?

35:13.356 --> 35:15.524
You're auditioning, right?

35:17.234 --> 35:18.026
What?

35:18.028 --> 35:18.984
For what?

35:18.986 --> 35:20.571
Parts in film, TV.

35:22.406 --> 35:27.243
No, the only parts I'm after
are half decent air filters.

35:27.245 --> 35:30.581
Yeah, but everyone's
auditioning.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.958
I thought everyone
had a script.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.293
You wrote a script?

35:34.295 --> 35:36.420
No, no, I can barely
write a birthday card.

35:36.422 --> 35:40.636
Just because I live in L.A.
doesn't mean, you know...

35:42.303 --> 35:44.345
Anyways, who's going to put
the asphalt under your feet

35:44.347 --> 35:46.055
so you can drive
to your auditions?

35:46.057 --> 35:48.058
Yeah, but, I mean,
you're all right looking,

35:48.060 --> 35:51.227
like you could do all right.

35:51.229 --> 35:52.480
I'll take it.

36:04.412 --> 36:08.624
Shouldn't we be behind a
velvet rope or something?

36:14.338 --> 36:15.131
You okay?

36:23.723 --> 36:26.891
Feel
the ocean inside.

36:26.893 --> 36:29.104
Every ounce of you hungry.

36:30.523 --> 36:35.236
You become abundance,
confidence.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.572
The Universe flows to you.

36:39.407 --> 36:41.616
Overcome every moment.

36:41.618 --> 36:44.038
Mind, body, soul victorious.

36:45.913 --> 36:49.540
You know in your many
hearts that fortune sides

36:49.542 --> 37:12.274
with she who dares.

37:12.276 --> 37:19.282
Benny...

37:19.284 --> 37:21.536
I'm going to ask you a favor.

37:54.155 --> 38:05.081
Shit!

38:05.083 --> 38:07.085
Hi, yeah, we're at Neon.

38:08.295 --> 38:10.755
Oh, sorry, yeah,
we're renovating.

38:11.966 --> 38:13.549
No, I can definitely
get you the club code,

38:13.551 --> 38:16.260
just hang on one sec for me.

38:16.262 --> 38:20.557
Uh, okay, it's 2,
6, 4, 3, 7, 5, 2.

38:23.019 --> 38:23.811
Okay.

38:24.646 --> 38:25.562
Okay, yeah.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.982
Thank you, sorry about that.

38:27.984 --> 38:29.482
Okay, bye.

38:35.241 --> 38:36.741
You
could come in handy.

38:39.578 --> 38:40.829
So...

38:40.831 --> 38:43.334
What do we do after the felony?

39:24.586 --> 39:26.669
Oh, God.

39:32.469 --> 39:36.097
Rabbit hole.

39:55.536 --> 39:58.036
Wait, wait, wait, wait, go back.

39:58.038 --> 39:58.831
No.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.958
What?

40:01.960 --> 40:02.750
You see something?

40:02.752 --> 40:04.504
Yeah.

40:12.220 --> 40:13.678
Oh, my gosh!

40:13.680 --> 40:14.763
Apple jack.

40:52.139 --> 40:53.516
Here, you do it.

41:21.045 --> 41:23.547
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:24.632 --> 41:25.673
Come on, come on, come on.

41:25.675 --> 41:26.634
Right, yeah.

41:28.095 --> 41:31.680
Passion
flares when you live edgeways.

41:31.682 --> 41:34.392
Live beyond your means.

41:34.394 --> 41:37.019
Live like you don't care.

41:37.021 --> 41:40.732
Live a disaster
impossible to salvage.

41:40.734 --> 41:44.070
And let this be The Moment.

41:45.029 --> 41:47.031
The Moment Fear Departs.

41:50.661 --> 41:51.618
Where is Ralphie?

41:51.620 --> 41:53.122
He's never on time.

41:57.084 --> 42:00.004
Ah, ah, ah, there
goes another one.

42:01.338 --> 42:04.549
That one looked like
my sister's daughter.

42:04.551 --> 42:07.219
We have got to get these
girls working for us.

42:07.221 --> 42:09.596
Or at least the
New York versions.

42:09.598 --> 42:11.139
And you know what?

42:11.141 --> 42:15.062
After New York, we are
going to save the waitresses

42:15.856 --> 42:17.149
in Los Angeles.

42:18.733 --> 42:22.443
Because there's going to be
an All-American Supper Club.

42:22.445 --> 42:23.820
It's going to be
on every corner.

42:23.822 --> 42:24.903
It's gonna be like Starbucks,

42:24.905 --> 42:26.363
it's gonna be like McDonald's,

42:26.365 --> 42:29.953
except we are going to
have plush furniture,

42:31.497 --> 42:40.546
a seven-course exotic meal
served by rescued waitresses.

42:40.548 --> 42:42.131
Are you gonna eat
that whole thing?

43:10.246 --> 43:13.666
Who the hell hangs
a plant in a bar?

43:13.668 --> 43:17.254
Maybe she
takes it out for walks.

43:18.798 --> 43:20.964
Maybe she's an even
bigger fool than I thought.

43:22.176 --> 43:22.966
Come on!

43:22.968 --> 43:24.803
Don't push a lady.

43:24.805 --> 43:26.888
Jesus!

43:26.890 --> 43:28.974
Apparently it's
gone, as in fucking gone!

43:31.061 --> 43:34.482
Apple jacks, like
down the Rabbit Hole

43:35.857 --> 43:37.358
out back of The Neon.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.736
Smalls, that's right, right?

44:31.168 --> 44:32.584
That was too bad.

44:32.586 --> 44:36.380
I liked her, all right,
she was all right.

44:36.382 --> 44:37.840
Yeah, I liked her, too.

44:37.842 --> 44:39.884
I thought she was nice.

44:39.886 --> 44:42.388
Not as nice as Ralph, but nice.

44:44.808 --> 44:46.390
You.

44:46.392 --> 44:49.518
You go and find my liquid asset.

44:51.900 --> 44:52.692
Come here.

44:58.239 --> 45:00.238
You get it back!

45:00.240 --> 45:01.990
It's mine!

45:01.992 --> 45:03.868
It's for my sanctuary.

45:03.870 --> 45:04.787
Piece of shit!

45:09.794 --> 45:12.252
It's not hers, not
for her restaurant!

45:13.546 --> 45:16.007
Not yours or whatever
the fuck you think!

45:16.009 --> 45:17.509
You will think
about it every day!

45:28.772 --> 45:30.814
My Sanctuary.

45:30.816 --> 45:32.774
My Peace On Earth.

45:40.911 --> 45:43.119
Breathe.

45:43.121 --> 45:44.371
Breathe.

45:44.373 --> 45:46.331
Yeah, yeah, just breathe.

45:46.333 --> 45:48.833
I hate being like that.

45:48.835 --> 45:49.627
I know.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.008
Look away, Karl.

46:05.228 --> 46:06.185
It's okay, Karl.

46:08.899 --> 46:12.192
You're the one who
likes to do this stuff.

46:12.194 --> 46:13.902
You're the psychopath.

46:20.412 --> 46:23.122
I'm building my
forest sanctuary.

46:26.001 --> 46:28.421
I'm going to have my plants.

46:30.422 --> 46:32.424
Where people can belong.

47:18.975 --> 47:20.352
Now is the time.

47:21.394 --> 47:22.812
You're holistic.

47:23.939 --> 47:24.731
Empowered.

47:26.233 --> 47:28.235
Connected to The Source.

47:29.654 --> 47:32.445
The embodiment of Harmony.

47:32.447 --> 47:33.241
Abundance.

47:34.701 --> 47:35.493
Drive.

47:36.619 --> 47:37.412
Drive.

47:38.788 --> 47:39.581
Drive.

47:45.461 --> 47:47.130
Reason is in Success.

47:48.841 --> 47:52.134
Success doesn't
come to just anyone.

47:52.136 --> 47:54.052
You deserve.

47:54.054 --> 47:55.263
Float.

47:55.265 --> 47:57.056
Float.

47:57.058 --> 48:00.726
Floating above them all, not
looking down, not looking back.

48:00.728 --> 48:02.436
No apologies.

48:24.670 --> 48:26.254
Here's those two
months rent I'm behind on

48:26.256 --> 48:28.923
and six months rent in advance.

48:28.925 --> 48:31.385
Oh, my Springer
Spaniel In Heaven!

48:31.387 --> 48:32.552
Gorgeous!

48:32.554 --> 48:35.222
Someday to have coconut
cake, won't you?

48:35.224 --> 48:36.724
I want to tell you,
Priscilla Anders,

48:36.726 --> 48:39.977
all about my premonitions of
how famous you're gonna be.

48:39.979 --> 48:42.230
And my dreams of how you're
going to take my place

48:42.232 --> 48:43.899
on the red carpet.

48:43.901 --> 48:46.026
You know what I was in?

48:46.028 --> 48:47.319
Cleopatra.

48:47.321 --> 48:49.071
And you can't pass up
having coconut cake

48:49.073 --> 48:51.865
with one of Cleopatra's
fictitious handmaidens.

48:51.867 --> 48:53.034
I
wouldn't dream of it.

48:53.036 --> 48:55.369
Oh.

48:55.371 --> 48:56.163
Someday!

48:57.289 --> 49:00.749
The caterpillar
thought the world ended,

49:00.751 --> 49:04.129
but then became a butterfly.

49:15.060 --> 49:17.476
Good girl, good girl.

49:17.478 --> 49:18.978
Good girl.

49:18.980 --> 49:20.230
Good.

49:20.232 --> 49:22.148
This is the place.

49:22.150 --> 49:22.943
I'll bet.

49:23.902 --> 49:25.487
This is the place.

49:26.404 --> 49:27.446
There is no famous actor

49:27.448 --> 49:28.738
that has not made it here,

49:28.740 --> 49:30.700
that has not then gone up above.

49:30.702 --> 49:32.785
Not without taking our
series of acting classes

49:32.787 --> 49:36.414
that act as balloons,
balloons that we provide

49:36.416 --> 49:41.253
toward floating toward
spheres of mega-technique.

49:41.255 --> 49:44.466
You have a twin:
boy-boy, girl-girl,

49:46.176 --> 49:49.677
girl-boy, boy-girl, any
of the combinations.

49:49.679 --> 49:53.601
Trust your twin more than
you to find the truth

49:55.019 --> 49:58.481
in the tapestry of stories,
the human universe.

50:01.818 --> 50:03.484
Now move, people, move!

50:03.486 --> 50:06.196
Find space for your twin!

50:06.198 --> 50:09.826
Give your doppelgänger
a place in the sun!

50:14.582 --> 50:17.791
Don't let the
darkness trouble you.

51:19.111 --> 51:20.359
Hello?

51:20.361 --> 51:21.694
Nothing
to get excited about,

51:21.696 --> 51:24.531
so don't get excited, but
they do want to see you again.

51:24.533 --> 51:25.448
Who?

51:25.450 --> 51:27.117
A goddamn callback.

51:27.119 --> 51:28.744
But don't get excited.

51:28.746 --> 51:31.163
But get this: they're
considering you for the lead.

51:31.165 --> 51:32.206
Oh!

51:34.127 --> 51:34.916
What?!

51:34.918 --> 51:35.710
What?!

52:06.077 --> 52:07.452
What's the matter?

52:07.454 --> 52:10.289
Didn't anybody give you
a haircut for Christmas?

52:24.723 --> 52:26.306
Disneyland.

52:53.462 --> 52:55.545
All those other girls
aren't here this time.

52:55.547 --> 52:59.384
Did you notice that?

52:59.386 --> 53:00.467
Nope.

53:00.469 --> 53:01.471
They're not.

53:06.434 --> 53:08.560
I want you to know that
if you get this part instead

53:08.562 --> 53:10.770
of me, you go with it,

53:10.772 --> 53:12.772
because I got time
stretched out ahead of me

53:12.774 --> 53:15.150
for this acting stuff
and I'm not sure I want

53:15.152 --> 53:18.445
to be famous just yet, and
this part might be that

53:18.447 --> 53:20.114
from what they say.

53:20.116 --> 53:22.534
I want to be just
me for a while.

53:22.536 --> 53:24.701
So, if you want this
part more than me,

53:24.703 --> 53:26.872
I pray that you get it.

53:26.874 --> 53:30.253
Because I got all this
time and I'm young.

53:31.838 --> 53:35.338
I am going to
destroy this audition.

53:35.340 --> 53:36.133
Good.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.676
I have time.

53:38.678 --> 53:40.011
I have plenty of time.

53:40.013 --> 53:42.389
Yesterday, I watched
the goddamn sunset.

53:42.391 --> 53:43.181
Did you?

53:43.183 --> 53:43.973
Yeah.

53:43.975 --> 53:45.433
Cool.

53:45.435 --> 53:49.230
How was it?

54:01.160 --> 54:01.952
Ladies.

54:06.082 --> 54:09.542
There should be three more
of you, shouldn't there?

54:09.544 --> 54:10.879
What the fuck?!

54:11.797 --> 54:14.255
And then they complain.

54:14.257 --> 54:18.552
And they say, and they
say, and they bitterly say

54:18.554 --> 54:21.805
that "It's tough to
make it in Hollywood."

54:21.807 --> 54:26.021
Yet one of you, ladies, might
get cast simply by showing up.

54:29.274 --> 54:30.524
Am I right?

54:42.956 --> 54:44.541
Hope you'll enjoy.

54:49.922 --> 54:51.798
We
need to retire this year.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.549
You guys are pretending
you don't love the shop

54:53.551 --> 54:55.176
when really you love the shop.

54:55.178 --> 54:57.595
It
was a surprise we were saving

54:57.597 --> 54:58.678
for when you came home.

54:58.680 --> 55:01.473
Daddy, things are
going well out here.

55:01.475 --> 55:03.059
I can actually send
you money this month.

55:03.061 --> 55:04.436
Would you like that?

55:04.438 --> 55:06.313
I repeat: you do not have
to put money in my account.

55:08.275 --> 55:09.565
See, Dad?

55:09.567 --> 55:10.942
I'm in demand, I
got another call.

55:10.944 --> 55:12.985
Your
mother wants to talk to you...

55:12.987 --> 55:14.070
This is Priscilla.

55:14.072 --> 55:16.533
Un-fucking-believable!

55:16.535 --> 55:19.202
Pris, the execs want to see you.

55:19.204 --> 55:20.870
Second callback, my dear.

55:20.872 --> 55:22.080
Second callback.

58:08.928 --> 58:09.680
Hey.

58:11.598 --> 58:12.973
Hey.

58:12.975 --> 58:15.642
Hey, I got that second callback.

58:15.644 --> 58:17.311
Of course you did.

58:17.313 --> 58:18.813
Congratulations.

58:18.815 --> 58:24.485
Hey, um...

58:24.487 --> 58:25.362
I'd give...

58:27.075 --> 58:28.616
I'd give all that
money back just to know

58:28.618 --> 58:35.038
that you're with me
for me and not...

58:35.040 --> 58:38.501
We can't give any
of the money back.

58:38.503 --> 58:39.878
I know.

58:51.059 --> 58:55.645
Look, without the money
I'd have to leave L.A..

58:55.647 --> 58:59.397
Then you'd probably
never see me again.

58:59.399 --> 59:01.901
Is that what you want?

59:01.903 --> 59:02.694
No.

59:09.161 --> 59:10.536
I really...

59:10.538 --> 59:12.123
I really have to go.

59:15.544 --> 59:16.336
Okay.

59:24.510 --> 59:26.805
Wish me luck, okay, handsome?

01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:55.173
Who's
this fucking asshole?!

01:01:55.175 --> 01:02:00.093
This was supposed to be a
lunch without any talking.

01:02:00.095 --> 01:02:03.931
Tell me he's not
coming this way.

01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:07.310
Tell me he's not waving
that fucking hand.

01:02:07.312 --> 01:02:10.480
Tell me this isn't going to
involve any fucking paperwork.

01:02:10.482 --> 01:02:11.859
Sorry, officers.

01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:14.818
I think there's a
guy following me.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.405
That why you jaywalked?

01:02:17.407 --> 01:02:19.617
That's a $300 ticket, FYI.

01:02:35.093 --> 01:02:37.843
So, who's doing
what to you now?

01:02:37.845 --> 01:02:40.806
This man is following me.

01:02:40.808 --> 01:02:41.972
Which man is that?

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.938
He's got a really
messed up face.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.232
That could be anybody.

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:51.943
No, you would
know him if you saw him.

01:02:51.945 --> 01:02:54.238
Oh, you mean like religion?

01:02:56.698 --> 01:02:58.075
It's just, um...

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:03.121
He's gone now, but he
was there a second ago.

01:03:03.123 --> 01:03:05.834
So, he's not
following you now?

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.128
You don't mind if I hang
around here for a second?

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:10.878
Just to make sure he's gone.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.005
You do whatever
makes you feel good

01:03:13.007 --> 01:03:15.760
about whatever
makes you feel okay.

01:03:15.762 --> 01:03:16.555
Okay?

01:03:18.139 --> 01:03:19.222
Thanks.

01:03:19.224 --> 01:03:20.015
Sorry.

01:03:24.229 --> 01:03:25.477
Just us.

01:03:25.479 --> 01:03:26.607
They told me.

01:03:31.486 --> 01:03:33.069
You and me!

01:03:33.071 --> 01:03:38.702
Exciting.

01:03:38.704 --> 01:03:39.994
Don't be nervous.

01:03:41.539 --> 01:03:45.207
My grandma always told me, "Little
girls mustn't get nervous

01:03:45.209 --> 01:03:46.876
"because then their
upper lips will sweat

01:03:46.878 --> 01:03:48.753
"and later they'll
grow a mustache."

01:04:03.938 --> 01:04:07.316
The closer we
get to the light,

01:04:07.318 --> 01:04:09.528
the more we want to scream.

01:04:10.737 --> 01:04:12.070
Junebug?

01:04:12.072 --> 01:04:12.862
Are you here?

01:04:12.864 --> 01:04:13.988
I'm here.

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.785
Good luck!

01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:17.245
Thank you.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.080
Oh, my God.

01:04:22.082 --> 01:04:24.168
I meant to say that to you.

01:04:25.504 --> 01:04:27.338
Good luck, Priscilla.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.380
Let me get your number after.

01:04:29.382 --> 01:04:32.009
That's what I want most of all.

01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:32.804
A friend.

01:05:43.672 --> 01:05:44.465
Hey!

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:48.634
Hey, I...

01:06:20.503 --> 01:06:21.293
Get away from me!

01:06:21.295 --> 01:06:22.336
Go inside!

01:06:22.338 --> 01:06:23.128
Go inside!

01:06:38.357 --> 01:06:39.980
911, what is
the nature of your emergency?

01:06:39.982 --> 01:06:41.148
I'm being chased.

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.942
I'm uh...

01:06:41.944 --> 01:06:43.400
I'm on LeMoyne!

01:06:43.402 --> 01:06:44.693
I'm going upstairs.

01:06:44.695 --> 01:06:46.904
We're going to be
on Rialto, okay?

01:06:46.906 --> 01:06:47.697
Rialto.

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:52.562
Priscilla.

01:08:21.801 --> 01:08:23.091
Hi, this is Benny.

01:08:23.093 --> 01:08:23.885
Sorry I missed you.

01:08:23.886 --> 01:08:24.885
We're gonna get you.

01:08:24.886 --> 01:08:25.970
Hi.

01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:28.430
Hi, it went really well.

01:08:28.433 --> 01:08:30.559
It went really, really well.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.354
I mean, the producer
was a total dick.

01:08:34.356 --> 01:08:36.231
But...

01:08:36.233 --> 01:08:38.399
But it went well.

01:08:38.402 --> 01:08:40.444
It went really well.

01:08:40.447 --> 01:08:41.281
Anyway, it...

01:08:44.158 --> 01:08:48.118
It just made me
really appreciate you.

01:08:48.121 --> 01:08:50.290
And I want to talk with you.

01:11:48.816 --> 01:11:52.278
It's time to get rid of Bobby.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.403
You think so?

01:11:53.405 --> 01:11:55.031
My sister can take him.

01:11:55.033 --> 01:11:57.700
Yeah, well, how
old's Bobby now?

01:11:57.702 --> 01:11:58.742
He's like two?

01:11:58.744 --> 01:12:00.536
Three.

01:12:00.538 --> 01:12:02.581
Well, that's time
enough to try out a kid,

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:03.998
don't you think?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.460
We're not a
suitable environment.

01:12:06.462 --> 01:12:12.507
Well, you try to build a
calm, relaxing forest sanctuary

01:12:12.509 --> 01:12:14.303
in a pinewood setting.

01:12:15.639 --> 01:12:18.138
Then someone comes along and
steals the greenery right out

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.350
from under it.

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:24.523
It's Smalls.

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:27.775
Do we know a Priscilla Anders?

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:30.443
He says: "She has it."

01:12:30.445 --> 01:12:31.238
Bobby!

01:12:32.113 --> 01:12:33.156
Bobby!

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:35.615
He's been listening
this entire time.

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:38.954
Bobby, pack your bag.

01:12:38.956 --> 01:12:41.164
You're going to
visit Aunt Martha.

01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:42.666
Oh, God!

01:12:42.668 --> 01:12:45.167
Goes out for cigarettes,
doesn't come back.

01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:46.460
Just like my Dad.

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.796
Well, I called
him about 10 times.

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:50.341
I called him 20.

01:12:50.343 --> 01:12:51.675
Now, let me tell you something:

01:12:51.677 --> 01:12:54.845
you need to learn
to hate people.

01:12:54.847 --> 01:12:56.514
Look, if he comes
by, can you, please,

01:12:56.516 --> 01:12:58.474
let him know that
I'm looking for him?

01:12:58.476 --> 01:13:04.648
If he comes by, I'm gonna
club him with this ratchet.

01:13:51.575 --> 01:13:53.869
World's Greatest Fisherman!

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.970
World's Greatest Fisherman!

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.224
What the fuck?!

01:14:15.226 --> 01:14:16.019
Deaf?

01:17:04.952 --> 01:17:07.995
What, then,
is your spiritual color?

01:17:07.997 --> 01:17:11.749
I need to know that you
know the final step.

01:17:15.713 --> 01:17:18.883
There are many more
shadows than lights.

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:24.973
But you know your way through
every bit of the dark.

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:55.005
I hope I didn't scare you.

01:17:56.131 --> 01:17:58.840
You seem like a nice girl.

01:17:58.842 --> 01:18:00.968
So I'm sorry.

01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:03.971
I usually let my brother
do this sort of thing.

01:18:03.973 --> 01:18:06.183
I...

01:18:06.185 --> 01:18:08.143
I hate doing it.

01:18:08.145 --> 01:18:09.185
I didn't...

01:18:09.187 --> 01:18:14.024
I didn't know it was your money.

01:18:14.026 --> 01:18:15.819
These things happen.

01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:18.031
Uh...

01:18:19.907 --> 01:18:21.993
Do you want me to count it?

01:18:32.588 --> 01:18:33.753
You know what?

01:18:33.755 --> 01:18:35.172
Forget it.

01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:41.053
What the hell's wrong with you?!

01:18:41.055 --> 01:18:41.847
Come here!

01:18:43.975 --> 01:18:46.517
Come here!

01:18:46.519 --> 01:18:47.312
Shite!

01:18:50.608 --> 01:18:51.400
Goddam it!

01:18:57.949 --> 01:18:59.033
It's not yours.

01:19:00.158 --> 01:19:02.159
It's mine.

01:19:02.161 --> 01:19:03.372
Belongs to me.

01:19:05.039 --> 01:19:08.082
I'm building a forest sanctuary.

01:19:08.084 --> 01:19:10.628
For the good of all humankind.

01:21:20.853 --> 01:21:23.021
Look what you
can do to a candle!

01:21:23.023 --> 01:21:25.316
I wish I could do that.

01:21:25.318 --> 01:21:26.150
Hey.

01:21:26.152 --> 01:21:32.113
Aw!

01:21:32.115 --> 01:21:32.908
You okay?

01:21:33.743 --> 01:21:35.328
You look a bit pale.

01:21:36.578 --> 01:21:39.288
I kicked a body into
the Los Angeles river.

01:21:41.168 --> 01:21:44.376
You are a Victorian-era-style
porcelain doll

01:21:44.378 --> 01:21:49.216
for inviting me out.

01:21:49.218 --> 01:21:51.469
Have you heard from them yet?

01:21:51.471 --> 01:21:52.720
No.

01:21:52.722 --> 01:21:54.137
Me neither.

01:21:54.139 --> 01:21:55.305
Makes me feel sick.

01:21:57.352 --> 01:21:59.976
Why are you nervous?

01:21:59.978 --> 01:22:00.980
You don't...

01:22:02.982 --> 01:22:05.316
You don't want the part.

01:22:16.497 --> 01:22:20.710
Do you want to get out of
here, go somewhere, go dancing?

01:22:23.921 --> 01:22:25.380
Okay.

01:22:25.382 --> 01:22:28.384
Just as long as you acknowledge
my perfect parking spot.

01:22:28.386 --> 01:22:31.219
Mm, that's fine,
we'll take my car.

01:22:31.221 --> 01:22:32.014
Cool!

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:35.515
Girls on the town!

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:36.642
Woo!

01:22:50.367 --> 01:22:53.368
And it is rare to see
one so completely healed

01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:55.245
of all breaks and scrapes.

01:22:55.247 --> 01:22:57.289
You, my dear, you must go.

01:22:57.291 --> 01:22:59.708
You no longer need me.

01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:00.919
I release you.

01:23:02.339 --> 01:23:03.299
You are seven,

01:23:04.591 --> 01:23:08.009
you are six, you are
five, you are four,

01:23:08.011 --> 01:23:11.387
you are three, you are two,

01:23:11.389 --> 01:23:12.556
you are one.

01:23:26.489 --> 01:23:28.364
All right, now,
we get in there,

01:23:28.366 --> 01:23:31.160
don't let anybody
stand behind you.

01:23:31.162 --> 01:23:32.493
O'Dell...

01:23:32.495 --> 01:23:33.871
And there's going
to be refreshments.

01:23:33.873 --> 01:23:35.831
Don't get involved in those.

01:23:35.833 --> 01:23:37.249
And the contracts in order,

01:23:37.251 --> 01:23:39.377
so just sign it
when they slide it.

01:23:39.379 --> 01:23:40.255
O'Dell...

01:23:41.798 --> 01:23:45.552
I'm going to need you to
stay here and wait for me.

01:23:51.099 --> 01:23:55.602
Honestly, we wanted
the younger one.

01:23:55.604 --> 01:23:57.397
That koala from Perth.

01:23:58.899 --> 01:24:01.694
But she's not
answering our calls.

01:24:03.197 --> 01:24:08.325
We need to move on with the
Romanians we're into this with.

01:24:08.327 --> 01:24:10.826
They are, after
all, from Romania.

01:24:10.828 --> 01:24:11.621
Hm.

01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:15.835
You didn't kill her, did you?

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.090
I buried her
body in the desert.

01:24:26.179 --> 01:24:29.430
Kudos to you if you did
dump a body in the desert.

01:24:29.432 --> 01:24:32.268
That would be
marvelous if you had,

01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:33.601
because we need
to see that breed

01:24:33.603 --> 01:24:37.565
of glimmer in your
eyes for this role.

01:24:37.567 --> 01:24:40.901
And we're not sure
we saw that on tape.

01:24:40.903 --> 01:24:42.406
We're not positive.

01:24:43.574 --> 01:24:46.660
I myself saw a petty
criminal in you.

01:24:48.579 --> 01:24:49.747
Not a murderess.

01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:54.458
My mind, in your auditions,
you came off more like someone

01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.919
who doesn't turn down a
snort of cocaine at a party

01:24:57.921 --> 01:25:01.258
if pressured, someone
who tries to overspend

01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.759
on her credit card
once in a while,

01:25:03.761 --> 01:25:05.803
someone who doesn't
hesitate to stick her hands

01:25:05.805 --> 01:25:07.599
in any old cookie jar.

01:25:08.934 --> 01:25:11.101
But at the end of
the day someone

01:25:11.103 --> 01:25:14.399
who can't pull the
lever to hang the man.

01:25:16.275 --> 01:25:19.653
I sincerely hope you
can put that weakness

01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:23.158
and hesitation behind you now.

01:25:24.366 --> 01:25:27.079
We need you to be
able to draw blood.

01:25:28.664 --> 01:25:30.622
I beg to differ.

01:25:30.624 --> 01:25:32.582
I'm in fact in love with you.

01:25:32.584 --> 01:25:36.547
I mean, your pure fear in the
last audition was palpable.

01:25:38.799 --> 01:25:41.676
And then some
shit-dipped expendable

01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:43.472
has to use the L Word.

01:25:45.765 --> 01:25:48.182
Time to rise, Priscilla.

01:25:48.184 --> 01:25:50.897
Rise from your
seat and approach.

01:26:37.697 --> 01:26:40.115
You gotta understand
that was tough love.

01:26:40.117 --> 01:26:42.035
I needed you to emerge.

01:26:43.202 --> 01:26:44.244
And how could I know?

01:26:45.288 --> 01:26:47.666
Nobody knows until it happens.

01:26:50.587 --> 01:26:53.045
If you take care of me now,

01:26:53.047 --> 01:26:56.549
I will live and die for you.

01:26:56.551 --> 01:26:58.300
My company is boutique.

01:26:58.302 --> 01:27:00.635
You go to one of
these bigger managers,

01:27:00.637 --> 01:27:03.599
they'll lose track of you
amongst all the A-listers.

01:27:03.601 --> 01:27:07.728
If you stick with me,
I will nurture you

01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:10.688
from here on every
step of the way.

01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:12.567
You have my solemn vow.

01:27:18.657 --> 01:27:22.202
That's what I've
always wanted to hear.

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.790
Oh, thank fuck!

01:27:25.625 --> 01:27:27.540
Okay.

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:28.335
Woo!

01:27:29.879 --> 01:27:32.296
All right, now let's get shit-faced
and take over the world.

01:27:40.724 --> 01:27:42.682
With what we were
into, my husband and I,

01:27:42.684 --> 01:27:44.811
I can't go to the police.

01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:47.188
What?

01:27:48.523 --> 01:27:52.817
Big famous actress in
the big famous movie?

01:27:52.819 --> 01:27:54.111
Who are you?

01:27:54.113 --> 01:27:57.156
Your friend to the
end, Priscilla Anders.

01:27:57.158 --> 01:27:59.908
Don't let my husband's
death come between us.

01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:01.036
I loved him.

01:28:01.038 --> 01:28:05.290
But, what's love?

01:28:05.292 --> 01:28:07.125
Now you listen to me.

01:28:07.127 --> 01:28:09.502
I have a dozen men
with your picture,

01:28:09.504 --> 01:28:13.050
all of them good with
guns, knives, poisons.

01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:18.637
Something happens to me,
you don't do as I say,

01:28:18.639 --> 01:28:21.682
your life is over,
and much more sadly,

01:28:21.684 --> 01:28:26.813
your career is over, cut
short, in its Hollywood prime.

01:28:26.815 --> 01:28:29.732
Yet, what do we want?

01:28:29.734 --> 01:28:32.861
We want your career
to flourish, don't we?

01:28:32.863 --> 01:28:35.864
We want you to be so
gloriously rich and famous,

01:28:35.866 --> 01:28:40.077
and acting in so many
movies, shows on television,

01:28:40.079 --> 01:28:42.997
plays on the stage, that
you have enough money

01:28:42.999 --> 01:28:47.919
to deposit $25,000 a month
into a special bank account.

01:28:47.921 --> 01:28:51.840
But careful, because this
money will be your rent.

01:28:51.842 --> 01:28:54.385
Due on the first of the month.

01:28:54.387 --> 01:28:58.057
You can never, ever
forget to make your rent.

01:28:59.391 --> 01:29:01.685
Did I say we'd be old friends?

01:29:01.687 --> 01:29:03.228
That's not true.

01:29:03.230 --> 01:29:05.480
You'll never see me again.

01:29:05.482 --> 01:29:08.024
But there are those
people out there,

01:29:08.026 --> 01:29:10.068
they will be watching.

01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:13.114
They'll be there if
ever you miss a payment.

01:29:13.116 --> 01:29:15.909
Now, don't frown.

01:29:15.911 --> 01:29:18.660
Because you know what I'd
call this if I were you?

01:29:18.662 --> 01:29:21.330
I'd call it inspiration.

01:29:21.332 --> 01:29:25.335
You're going to have an amazing
career, Priscilla Anders.

01:29:25.337 --> 01:29:26.961
You're going to be
one of those actresses

01:29:26.963 --> 01:29:30.384
who's an actress until
the day she dies.

01:29:31.469 --> 01:29:34.594
"She's so inspired,"
they'll say.

01:29:34.596 --> 01:29:40.059
They'll ask: "Priscilla, how
do you stay so very inspired

01:29:40.061 --> 01:29:43.313
"with inspiration that
never flags nor falters?"

01:29:43.315 --> 01:29:46.733
They'll ask: "How
does she do it?

01:29:46.735 --> 01:29:47.733
"How

01:29:47.735 --> 01:29:48.526
"does

01:29:48.528 --> 01:29:49.528
"she

01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:50.613
"do

01:29:50.615 --> 01:29:51.407
"it?"

01:29:53.743 --> 01:29:55.203
Is that your drink?

01:30:00.793 --> 01:30:03.084
That doesn't have any alcohol.

01:30:03.086 --> 01:30:04.879
What's wrong with you?

01:30:09.468 --> 01:30:10.344
Even trade.

01:30:22.815 --> 01:30:25.442
The
Universe delivers Success

01:30:25.444 --> 01:30:27.238
to those who trust it.

01:30:28.573 --> 01:30:31.906
Be sure your ears are pricked.

01:30:31.908 --> 01:30:33.241
Listen.

01:30:33.243 --> 01:30:34.742
Listen.

01:30:34.744 --> 01:30:37.872
Listening always for that knock.

01:30:40.588 --> 01:30:45.588
