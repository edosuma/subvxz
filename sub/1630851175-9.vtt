(horse neighing)

12:12.407 --> 12:14.011
(laughs)

12:16.148 --> 12:18.352
(grunts)

12:19.488 --> 12:21.025
(distant shouting)

12:21.058 --> 12:24.364
No, no, no, no!
Wait a minute!

12:24.398 --> 12:26.468
No, no, no!
Stop this! Please!

12:26.503 --> 12:28.874
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

12:28.907 --> 12:32.314
No. No, no, no, no! That's...

12:32.347 --> 12:34.051
Stop that!

12:34.084 --> 12:36.890
(indistinct shouting)

12:36.923 --> 12:39.829
Don't! Laura!

12:41.165 --> 12:44.004
Don't touch
the fucking Corn Pops!

12:46.442 --> 12:49.214
WOMAN:
Get it! Get it! Get it!

12:49.247 --> 12:50.985
My name is Athena.

12:51.018 --> 12:53.055
WOMAN 2:
Get out of our way!

12:55.894 --> 12:57.832
MAN:
Red or green? Your list
just says "peppers."

12:57.865 --> 12:59.502
‐They got yellow and orange.
‐(loud thudding)

12:59.535 --> 13:01.071
Hi. It's Bennett. How are you?

13:01.105 --> 13:02.908
It's 3:30 your time...

13:02.942 --> 13:04.478
(whoops)

13:04.512 --> 13:06.950
‐MAN 2: Hey.
‐BENNETT: Uh, you went before?

13:06.983 --> 13:09.021
‐Um...
‐(overlapping chatter)

13:09.054 --> 13:11.793
(chatter in slow motion)

13:11.826 --> 13:13.530
I used to caddy.
Summer job.

13:13.563 --> 13:15.133
(distorted voice)

13:15.166 --> 13:17.137
‐I actually had...
‐(electrical squeal)

13:17.170 --> 13:19.107
...a pretty good...

13:19.141 --> 13:20.209
swing!

13:20.243 --> 13:23.449
Great pick. Ten out of ten.

13:23.482 --> 13:25.386
Girls fucking nailed it!

13:25.420 --> 13:28.059
You got some water?

13:28.092 --> 13:30.063
(panting)

13:30.096 --> 13:32.501
I'm thirsty, Nora. That's how
people get heatstroke.

13:32.535 --> 13:36.108
We could've traded that.
All of this had value.

13:36.141 --> 13:38.880
You got the girls all riled up.
Now we have nothing!

13:38.914 --> 13:41.853
A week ago, we were starving.
Now look at us.

13:41.886 --> 13:44.525
I walk around here,
I see a lot of happy girls.

13:44.559 --> 13:47.163
Fuck this stuff.
No one else is worried.

13:47.197 --> 13:49.234
Of course not.
I'm surrounded by children!

13:52.508 --> 13:55.514
MACK:
Your tent's ready.

13:55.547 --> 13:58.352
Wow! Already?

13:58.386 --> 14:00.256
Superstar.

14:01.593 --> 14:05.433
(laughs)
Good job, Mack!

14:07.538 --> 14:09.976
Take me to my lair. (laughs)

14:12.313 --> 14:13.482
Come here.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.994
I like that jump. Nice.

14:24.204 --> 14:26.108
PEGGY: The Secret Service
is doing a training exercise.

14:26.141 --> 14:28.112
Her detail is off site
until tomorrow.

14:28.145 --> 14:29.882
This is our window.

14:29.916 --> 14:31.251
I've reassigned the agents
closest to her.

14:31.285 --> 14:33.155
We're rotating in
some new recruits.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.594
They don't know her.
They'll follow their CO's lead.

14:35.627 --> 14:37.498
REGINA:
Second thoughts, General?

14:37.531 --> 14:39.602
Now's the time.

14:39.635 --> 14:41.639
No, ma'am.

14:42.641 --> 14:45.647
I know I'm not
a traditional choice.

14:45.681 --> 14:50.022
You seem like someone who values
tradition and continuity.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.895
Two of my pilots are dead.

14:52.928 --> 14:55.934
Murdered on the orders
of a sitting president.

14:55.968 --> 14:58.607
She's lost the right to lead.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.982
Mm. What about you?
Second thoughts?

15:07.725 --> 15:09.695
Madam Secretary.

15:09.729 --> 15:12.501
Oh, Madam President.

15:12.535 --> 15:15.206
At least, it will be
in about 30 minutes.

15:18.112 --> 15:20.717
‐(door opens, closes)
‐REGINA: What do you need?

15:20.751 --> 15:22.955
A Valium?

15:22.988 --> 15:25.193
These women don't trust me.

15:25.226 --> 15:27.998
You have to reassure them.

15:28.032 --> 15:30.002
You picked me.

15:30.036 --> 15:31.205
They can, too.

15:34.077 --> 15:36.148
Jesus, Kim.

15:36.181 --> 15:38.520
Get your shit together.

15:40.591 --> 15:41.960
I need you.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.129
(door opens)

16:00.163 --> 16:02.167
(door closes)

16:26.481 --> 16:29.087
BETH:
She was still there.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.291
Alone.

16:31.325 --> 16:34.499
Doctors were long gone.
No food, no water.

16:34.532 --> 16:37.505
You know what Jennifer said
when I told her?

16:37.538 --> 16:40.109
"I wish I could've made a call."

16:40.142 --> 16:41.546
A call.

16:41.579 --> 16:43.449
She's not a bad person.

16:43.482 --> 16:46.421
These are just the rules
she's learned to live by.

16:46.455 --> 16:48.593
This system has
always been broken,

16:48.627 --> 16:51.431
but they will hold onto it
as long as they can.

16:51.465 --> 16:53.202
It is all they know.

16:53.235 --> 16:55.072
So we have
to tear that place down.

16:55.106 --> 16:57.310
Let the grass grow.

16:59.281 --> 17:04.692
You've known Jennifer Brown a
lot longer than you've known us.

17:04.725 --> 17:07.665
Yeah. And if you hadn't met me,

17:07.698 --> 17:11.539
you'd still be watching
at that fucking gate.

17:12.575 --> 17:14.477
KAI:
It's ready.

17:24.164 --> 17:27.270
(rapid ticking)

17:40.564 --> 17:44.404
I would kill for anything fresh.

17:44.437 --> 17:47.377
Those sad tomatoes, gray ones?

17:47.410 --> 17:49.481
(Jennifer chuckles)

17:50.817 --> 17:53.823
It's not fresh, but...

17:55.426 --> 17:58.332
I had Abby grab them
from the kitchen for you.

17:58.365 --> 18:00.469
‐I know you like 'em.
‐(laughs)

18:02.473 --> 18:04.545
Ma'am, the...

18:04.578 --> 18:07.584
They are just oranges.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.256
What?

18:10.289 --> 18:11.626
Um...

18:11.659 --> 18:13.830
What is it?
What's wrong?

18:13.863 --> 18:16.502
I m‐made a mistake.

18:16.536 --> 18:18.573
Uh...

18:18.607 --> 18:20.611
I was on the pill.

18:21.613 --> 18:23.449
I couldn't have missed more
than a day, two at most,

18:23.482 --> 18:25.754
and then so many women
miscarried, so I thought...

18:25.787 --> 18:27.323
You're pregnant?

18:27.357 --> 18:29.194
(voice breaking):
I'm so sorry.

18:29.227 --> 18:30.664
‐No.
‐I was selfish and reckless.

18:30.697 --> 18:32.868
‐I didn't mean it like that. No.
‐It was an enormous error

18:32.901 --> 18:36.141
‐in judgment...
‐No sorrys. No sorrys.

18:38.178 --> 18:39.715
How are you feeling?

18:39.749 --> 18:43.556
(laughs, sniffles)

18:43.590 --> 18:45.794
Well, I always wanted
to have kids...

18:45.827 --> 18:48.399
someday.

18:48.432 --> 18:50.604
But it's not like...

18:53.543 --> 18:55.547
I wasn't in love.

18:55.580 --> 18:59.154
But this could be
my only chance, and

18:59.187 --> 19:00.590
what kind of a world would...?

19:00.624 --> 19:02.728
Nobody knows
what they're doing, okay?

19:02.761 --> 19:05.834
I was terrified
when I was pregnant with Hero,

19:05.867 --> 19:09.407
afraid I'd fuck it up,
and, I mean,

19:09.441 --> 19:10.911
even at our worst,

19:10.944 --> 19:13.148
she was the best decision
I've ever made.

19:14.618 --> 19:16.589
‐(knocking)
‐Ma'am, I...

19:16.622 --> 19:18.292
‐Just a minute.
‐(door opens)

19:18.325 --> 19:20.296
I said just a moment!

19:20.329 --> 19:22.233
Ma'am, they need you
in the war room.

19:22.266 --> 19:23.703
Where's Abby?

19:23.737 --> 19:25.707
And who are you?

19:25.741 --> 19:27.745
KIMBERLY:
You were in the woods.

19:27.778 --> 19:30.817
He was ten feet away.
Is that him?

19:30.851 --> 19:33.923
Yorick Brown, no question.

19:33.957 --> 19:35.527
Hmm.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.198
‐She's been coached.
‐If we were making this up,

19:38.232 --> 19:39.902
it'd be a hell
of a lot more believable.

19:39.935 --> 19:42.775
Jennifer heard the captain's
story and had her reassigned.

19:42.808 --> 19:45.580
It's a staggering abuse
of power.

19:45.614 --> 19:47.651
(door opens)

20:05.286 --> 20:07.356
What's all this?

20:07.390 --> 20:10.731
LISA: They're saying
your son is alive.

20:10.764 --> 20:12.735
Burgin found him in New York.

20:18.312 --> 20:20.349
Tell them to stand down.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.923
KIMBERLY:
You're unbelievable.

20:23.957 --> 20:27.598
My mother was fragile, grieving.

20:27.631 --> 20:28.833
Kim, I know
you're suffering, but...

20:28.867 --> 20:30.369
You killed my mother,

20:30.403 --> 20:32.574
made her feel crazy.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.678
Might as well have pushed her
off the roof yourself.

20:34.712 --> 20:36.983
She's been lying to all of you.

20:37.016 --> 20:38.753
She's still lying to you.

20:38.787 --> 20:42.594
This sisterhood you think
you're building‐‐ it's bullshit.

20:42.628 --> 20:44.932
Is it true?

20:44.965 --> 20:48.940
Lisa, this is a woman
who has concerns about fluoride.

20:48.973 --> 20:50.777
She's not a serious person.

20:50.811 --> 20:52.548
Is that supposed
to hurt my feelings?

20:52.581 --> 20:54.752
She's been keeping you all
in the dark.

20:54.785 --> 20:58.560
All of you.
Everyone except for you,

20:58.593 --> 20:59.895
Christine.

21:01.766 --> 21:04.270
‐What?
‐I am saying this as someone

21:04.304 --> 21:06.642
who cares about you.
You need to come clean.

21:06.676 --> 21:07.845
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:07.878 --> 21:09.047
There are two eyewitnesses.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.884
She used you
to cover her tracks.

21:10.917 --> 21:13.690
The order to have the captain
reassigned came through you.

21:17.764 --> 21:19.735
‐Enough.
‐Let‐let her finish.

21:19.768 --> 21:23.510
KIMBERLY:
Listen to me. Jennifer Brown
won't suffer that much,

21:23.543 --> 21:26.782
but you‐‐ you're nobody.

21:26.816 --> 21:29.053
No one is going to protect you.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.690
Those people out there
at the gate?

21:30.724 --> 21:33.362
When they find out
that you knew about this?

21:33.395 --> 21:35.534
They're going to rip you
limb from limb.

21:35.567 --> 21:37.504
‐I don't...
‐I'm just looking out for you.

21:37.538 --> 21:39.775
‐Somebody has to.
‐Leave her out of this.

21:39.809 --> 21:41.846
She didn't know.

21:43.048 --> 21:45.486
‐No, ma'am...
‐It's okay.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.540
‐I thought he was dead.
‐WOMAN: Oh, God.

21:55.574 --> 21:59.013
‐Oh, my God, Jennifer. Like...
‐He was found in New York

21:59.047 --> 22:03.355
in the evacuation.
I have no idea how he survived.

22:03.388 --> 22:05.894
‐You can't be serious?
‐He was in this building?

22:05.927 --> 22:08.365
There is a geneticist
at Harvard.

22:08.398 --> 22:10.570
Agent Burgin is
bringing Yorick to her

22:10.604 --> 22:13.743
‐so we can learn how, why he...
‐REGINA: Harvard?

22:13.776 --> 22:16.047
They were
in Central Pennsylvania.

22:16.081 --> 22:18.051
Where were they going?

22:18.085 --> 22:20.055
That's classified.

22:20.089 --> 22:23.696
Oh, classified?
Or you don't fucking know?

22:23.730 --> 22:27.436
I did what I thought
was best, for all of us.

22:27.470 --> 22:29.007
‐If anyone found out that you...
‐AISHA: That's not a good way

22:29.040 --> 22:30.810
for a president
to start a sentence.

22:30.844 --> 22:32.614
Presidents make tough decisions.

22:32.648 --> 22:35.119
The best thing to do
was keep the circle closed.

22:35.152 --> 22:38.058
It's not much of a circle
if it's just you.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.795
KIMBERLY:
You took our only chance

22:39.828 --> 22:41.566
at bringing the world back,

22:41.599 --> 22:42.601
and you hid him away.

22:42.634 --> 22:44.638
‐I had no choice.
‐He could have been killed,

22:44.672 --> 22:46.709
‐taken by foreign powers...
‐We're already a target!

22:46.742 --> 22:49.113
‐The selfishness!
‐I did what I did

22:49.147 --> 22:51.418
to protect you, all of you.

22:51.451 --> 22:53.088
KIMBERLY:
The future of the human race

22:53.121 --> 22:55.059
depends on his survival,

22:55.092 --> 22:57.931
and you sent him out there
with one person?

22:57.965 --> 23:00.135
You weren't thinking
about any of us.

23:00.169 --> 23:02.073
You wanted him
all to yourself.

23:02.106 --> 23:05.079
‐He's my son.
‐My sons are dead!

23:05.112 --> 23:08.185
Two American helicopter pilots
were murdered on your orders.

23:08.218 --> 23:09.989
‐That's not true.
‐You wanted no one to know.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.926
You said it yourself:
"Keep the circle closed."

23:11.959 --> 23:15.132
I would never. That was
a horrifying accident.

23:15.165 --> 23:17.436
Either Burgin is taking orders
from you, or she's gone rogue.

23:17.470 --> 23:20.142
Either way, you've lost control.

23:20.175 --> 23:22.547
REGINA:
You'll be placed
in protective custody,

23:22.581 --> 23:24.050
and we will figure out
a transition.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.587
‐RACHEL: Isn't that premature?
‐(indistinct chatter)

23:25.620 --> 23:27.423
This is not a discussion.

23:28.660 --> 23:31.031
She has to go.

23:33.468 --> 23:35.607
MIRANDA:
She's right, Jennifer.

23:35.640 --> 23:39.548
They're already screaming
"conspiracy."

23:39.581 --> 23:40.951
Can you imagine, with this?

23:42.788 --> 23:45.159
PRIYA:
We get out ahead of it,

23:45.192 --> 23:47.631
or we all seem guilty.

23:58.519 --> 24:00.757
(rapid ticking)

24:05.634 --> 24:07.671
Shh! Do you hear that?

24:10.910 --> 24:13.850
(rapid ticking)

24:16.956 --> 24:19.495
‐Run!
‐(dings)

24:22.133 --> 24:24.905
Secretary Oliver will serve out
the rest of Jennifer's term.

24:24.938 --> 24:29.013
No! We'll choose
an acting president, one of us.

24:29.047 --> 24:30.684
She'll serve until
we can hold an election.

24:30.717 --> 24:33.890
There was an election.
Ted Campbell won, he picked me.

24:33.923 --> 24:35.927
‐Campbell doesn't get a say.
‐The voters do.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.764
(loud knocking)

24:37.798 --> 24:39.501
(murmuring)

24:39.535 --> 24:40.704
(door opens)

24:40.737 --> 24:42.641
(quietly):
There's been an explosion.

24:42.674 --> 24:44.077
What's happening?

24:44.110 --> 24:46.114
I need you all to come with me.

24:46.147 --> 24:47.617
There's been
an explosion underground.

24:47.651 --> 24:48.986
‐What? Where?
‐What exactly

24:49.020 --> 24:50.990
are we talking about?
An accident? Attack?

24:51.024 --> 24:52.093
‐We have to get somewhere safe.
‐Come on. Come on.

24:52.126 --> 24:53.261
‐This way. Let's go.
‐The emergency command center,

24:53.295 --> 24:55.633
C‐ring.
It's secure, blast‐proof.

24:55.667 --> 24:56.936
We'll figure out what's
going on and go from there.

24:56.969 --> 24:59.040
So you can lock us in?
Force our hand?

24:59.073 --> 25:01.612
PEGGY:
I'll be first one in,
and the last one out.

25:01.645 --> 25:04.217
We can't stay here.
Let's go please. Fast. Let's go!

25:04.250 --> 25:06.822
Move, move, move!

25:10.830 --> 25:13.168
(coughing)

25:16.876 --> 25:19.581
‐(coughing)
‐(indistinct, quiet chatter)

25:26.595 --> 25:28.131
‐Come on!
‐JOY: Fighting at the gate!

25:28.165 --> 25:31.071
People heard the bomb. They're
pulling down a piece of fence.

25:31.104 --> 25:32.808
‐It's really happening.
‐SOLDIER: We need support.

25:32.841 --> 25:33.810
They're sending
companies to secure

25:33.843 --> 25:35.145
the perimeter, sweep the roof.

25:35.179 --> 25:37.149
‐They're scrambling.
‐JOY: Second bomb is

25:37.183 --> 25:38.151
by the generators, ready to go.

25:38.185 --> 25:39.320
‐Patrols?
‐JOY: Just the one.

25:39.353 --> 25:41.157
You were right‐‐
they're spread thin.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.061
Start sending people
through here. Get as many

25:43.095 --> 25:45.232
in here as possible.
We need cover.

25:45.265 --> 25:47.269
‐VIPs headed to C‐ring.
‐(people coughing)

25:47.303 --> 25:48.773
Come on. Move, move!

25:51.144 --> 25:53.081
Eyes up.

25:53.115 --> 25:55.052
You're the only one of us
that's been inside.

25:55.085 --> 25:57.123
You good?

25:57.156 --> 25:59.127
Good. Come on.

26:08.913 --> 26:09.815
PEGGY:
Protesters breached the gate.

26:09.848 --> 26:11.284
‐Where are they now?
‐Did you send them?

26:11.317 --> 26:13.288
Of course not.
This wasn't us.

26:13.321 --> 26:14.992
LISA:
Okay. Crowd control.
What is the plan?

26:15.025 --> 26:17.163
PEGGY:
Water cannons, tear gas.

26:17.196 --> 26:19.601
Live ammunition
only if we have to.

26:19.635 --> 26:21.070
What if they're already inside?
We need to evacuate.

26:21.104 --> 26:22.908
MIRANDA:
We'll handle this, Jennifer.

26:22.941 --> 26:25.179
What kind of breach
are we talking about?

26:25.212 --> 26:26.816
How many people? 50?

26:26.849 --> 26:28.753
‐500?
‐REGINA: What if we don't
clear the building?

26:28.786 --> 26:30.757
‐I mean, at least not yet.
‐These people are angry.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.994
‐They hate us!
‐REGINA: They hate
Jennifer Brown.

26:33.028 --> 26:35.299
I mean, give me a chance
to talk to them.

26:35.332 --> 26:37.203
Regina! Peggy,
clear the building.

26:37.236 --> 26:39.207
Oh, all due respect, hon,
you don't even have a title.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.309
Hey, I'm trying
to convince these people

26:40.342 --> 26:42.146
‐you're a steady hand.
‐(explosion)

26:42.179 --> 26:43.616
(screaming)

26:43.649 --> 26:45.653
PEGGY:
Stay calm!

26:45.687 --> 26:46.789
Follow me.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.993
(indistinct chatter)

27:14.210 --> 27:16.314
‐Stop! Drop your weapons!
‐(screaming)

27:16.347 --> 27:19.220
‐Guns... down!
‐(gasping, whimpering)

27:19.253 --> 27:21.926
Guns down.

27:21.959 --> 27:24.197
Put the guns down!

27:30.743 --> 27:33.114
‐Stand down.
‐(soft whimpering)

27:33.148 --> 27:34.985
Stand down.

27:43.903 --> 27:45.974
Put your hands out
in front of you!

27:46.007 --> 27:47.811
Hands out!

27:47.844 --> 27:49.347
Go.

27:51.886 --> 27:53.956
(woman whimpering)

27:53.990 --> 27:56.227
(zip ties squeaking)

27:59.166 --> 28:00.937
Don't.

28:04.176 --> 28:07.016
DENISE:
Everyone in a uniform,
follow me.

28:07.049 --> 28:09.287
‐No, no, no,
you‐you can't. You can't!
‐Let's go. Move.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.391
‐PEGGY: We'll be okay.
‐Move!

28:11.424 --> 28:13.395
‐Move! Move.
‐Move!
‐Yeah. Go.

28:13.428 --> 28:16.134
‐(indistinct shout)
‐Let's go! Move!

28:16.167 --> 28:17.871
‐Hurry up!
‐Go.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.273
‐Move! Come on!
‐You're okay. You're okay.

28:19.307 --> 28:21.311
Move, move, move!

28:21.344 --> 28:23.381
‐Move! Move.
‐Move!

28:26.922 --> 28:29.928
‐(laughter)
‐HALEY: Once I saw Roxanne,
I forgot to be scared.

28:29.962 --> 28:32.199
Well, that's fun for you,
'cause I was fucking nervous.

28:32.233 --> 28:34.437
‐(laughter)
‐Hero wasn't.

28:34.470 --> 28:36.441
(Hero laughs)

28:36.474 --> 28:38.946
‐No, I was.
‐Hmm?

28:38.980 --> 28:41.217
I saw you: fearless.

28:41.251 --> 28:43.188
Makes sense.

28:44.958 --> 28:47.898
Your boyfriend. Hmm?

28:47.931 --> 28:50.002
You killed him, right?

28:50.035 --> 28:52.807
‐KELSEY: Yeah.
‐Yeah.

28:52.841 --> 28:54.811
He made you do it.

28:54.845 --> 28:57.349
Goaded you into it.
It was his fault, not yours.

28:57.383 --> 29:00.455
‐(scoffs) Yeah.
‐Yeah.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.426
Come on, let's go.

29:04.965 --> 29:08.471
‐Thank you.
‐(grunts)

29:08.506 --> 29:11.210
(indistinct, distant chatter)

29:11.244 --> 29:12.346
(laughter)

29:12.379 --> 29:14.350
I can't believe you did this.

29:14.383 --> 29:16.522
I can't stop thinking about it.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.026
‐Really?
‐Yeah. Stop it.

29:19.060 --> 29:21.932
‐(laughs)
‐Yeah, that sucks.
I saw what you did.

29:37.129 --> 29:41.437
I used to get so angry...
over nothing.

29:43.041 --> 29:45.813
Robbie... (laughs)

29:47.584 --> 29:49.855
Robbie would call
to check the grocery list.

29:49.888 --> 29:53.228
Uh, "Peppers‐‐ red or green?"
I don't fucking care.

29:53.261 --> 29:55.500
Make a choice,
like I did, when I wrote

29:55.533 --> 29:57.202
"peppers" in the first place!

30:01.912 --> 30:04.250
I did exactly
what I was supposed to do.

30:04.283 --> 30:06.421
I had the husband, the kids,

30:06.454 --> 30:08.959
the house, the job.

30:10.897 --> 30:12.934
Wasn't enough.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.180
I wanted to be better.

30:19.213 --> 30:21.451
Different.

30:21.484 --> 30:24.825
But I am who I am.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.801
I'm angry.

30:35.178 --> 30:37.149
It's what kept me alive.

30:37.182 --> 30:40.055
I would've died without it.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.992
Mack and I never
would've made it.

30:52.112 --> 30:54.584
Next time,

30:54.618 --> 30:57.924
don't tell Roxanne your secrets.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.395
She's not worthy of them.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.217
AISHA:
If we pull the sprinklers,

31:11.250 --> 31:13.321
‐then we can...
‐No, we rerouted them weeks ago.

31:13.354 --> 31:15.325
Couldn't spare the water.

31:15.358 --> 31:19.467
This must've taken months.
Surveillance, planning.

31:19.501 --> 31:21.304
‐MIRANDA: Someone on the inside?
‐LISA: Maybe.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.976
‐Is‐is that...?
‐Yeah. Shh, shh.

31:24.009 --> 31:26.615
How did they even get in here?

31:26.648 --> 31:28.953
Regina got General Reed
on her side.

31:28.986 --> 31:31.090
I mean, the fucking U. S. Army?

31:31.124 --> 31:32.393
They made us vulnerable.

31:32.426 --> 31:34.363
You can't tell them
about Yorick.

31:34.397 --> 31:36.602
What if Regina...?

31:36.635 --> 31:39.206
It's her word against ours.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.210
You should have told us.

31:41.244 --> 31:43.616
‐Would you have?
‐MALIKA: Hey,

31:43.649 --> 31:46.053
‐destroy records, comms.
‐KAI: This is fucking huge.

31:46.087 --> 31:48.659
Destroy records, comms. Go, now!

31:48.692 --> 31:51.097
Army wants proof of life, or
they'll start using live rounds.

31:51.130 --> 31:53.101
‐She's right there.
Put her on.
‐They're asking for

31:53.134 --> 31:55.272
Regina Oliver.
They say she's the president.

31:55.305 --> 31:57.242
‐What? Call them back.
‐I know, it's crazy.

31:57.276 --> 32:00.650
Find out what the fuck is going
on. Don't agree to anything.

32:00.683 --> 32:02.987
BETH:
Regina Oliver?

32:03.021 --> 32:04.356
Where the fuck are the soldiers?

32:04.390 --> 32:05.493
KIMBERLY: They can't just
come in here shooting.

32:05.526 --> 32:07.096
We'll lose the whole government.

32:07.129 --> 32:09.601
Oh, God.

32:09.634 --> 32:11.505
(indistinct chatter)

32:11.538 --> 32:13.576
Talk.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.251
This is Kimberly Campbell?

32:18.284 --> 32:20.355
SOLDIER:
Ma'am, is the president
with you? Is she safe?

32:26.167 --> 32:28.404
We're in the war room. They have
guns. We're in the war room.

32:28.438 --> 32:31.277
(screaming, gasping, whimpering)

32:31.310 --> 32:34.416
‐(gasping)
‐Jennifer Brown
or Regina Oliver.

32:34.450 --> 32:37.022
Who is it?
Who is the president?!

32:37.055 --> 32:38.324
Answer her. Who's in charge?

32:38.358 --> 32:40.162
Me, me. Me.

32:40.195 --> 32:42.667
Food, medicine, weapon reserves.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.105
We want locations, access.

32:45.138 --> 32:47.442
Okay, we can talk,
after you let them go.

32:47.476 --> 32:49.446
You don't need all of us.
I'm enough.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.718
Stockpiles‐‐ where are they?

32:51.752 --> 32:53.656
‐(loud thudding on door)
‐What was that?

32:53.689 --> 32:56.394
There are a thousand military
personnel in this building,

32:56.427 --> 32:58.298
being very careful right now,

32:58.331 --> 32:59.668
but they're gonna
get in this room.

32:59.701 --> 33:01.404
One way or another.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.007
I can help you.

33:03.041 --> 33:04.711
Any offer she makes you
is worthless.

33:04.744 --> 33:07.550
Jennifer Brown doesn't
speak for anyone.

33:07.584 --> 33:09.588
Not anymore.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.692
I'm the president.

33:11.725 --> 33:14.063
‐Regina, sit down!
‐I'll negotiate.

33:14.096 --> 33:16.334
‐I am your best and only bet.
‐PRIYA: What?

33:16.367 --> 33:19.273
LISA:
Where are the stockpiles?
Where are the weapons silos?

33:19.306 --> 33:21.310
Can you tell her
any fucking thing?

33:21.344 --> 33:23.682
Let the adults do their jobs!

33:23.716 --> 33:26.053
You always were
a liberal fucking snake.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.322
‐Go to hell!
‐(loud, overlapping chatter)

33:27.356 --> 33:29.193
‐(gunshot)
‐Quiet!
‐(soft shrieking)

33:29.226 --> 33:30.730
Quiet for one fucking second!

33:30.763 --> 33:32.466
(soft whimpering)

33:36.240 --> 33:37.744
We have to move.

33:37.777 --> 33:39.346
She told them where we are.

33:39.380 --> 33:40.650
They could be down here
any second.

33:40.683 --> 33:42.352
Okay, we can't move 20 people.

33:42.386 --> 33:43.756
We'd need a goddamn school bus.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.325
Small groups, then.

33:45.358 --> 33:46.728
We can hide in B‐ring.
We can't stay here.

33:46.762 --> 33:48.999
(gasps)

33:51.370 --> 33:53.709
Okay. Get everybody
and move. Go.

33:53.742 --> 33:57.182
‐You. You three, get up.
‐You, up. Move!

33:57.216 --> 33:58.484
Well, I can talk about this.

33:58.519 --> 33:59.788
‐Shut up. Move!
‐Get over here!

33:59.821 --> 34:01.357
‐Okay, we're going. We're going.
‐Let's go.

34:01.390 --> 34:02.760
‐Stay calm.
‐Come on. Come on.

34:02.794 --> 34:05.499
‐Where are you taking them?
‐Come on. Go. Move it.

34:05.533 --> 34:07.637
WOMAN (over bullhorn):
Disperse immediately.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.643
Clear the building,
or you will be shot on sight.

34:10.676 --> 34:12.747
Leave the building immediately.

34:23.669 --> 34:25.806
‐WOMAN: Let us in!
‐Where are you taking us?

34:25.840 --> 34:28.244
Let's‐let's talk.
I can help you.

34:28.278 --> 34:31.417
I‐I am on your side. What,
you'd rather deal with her?

34:31.450 --> 34:34.524
The shit she's done‐‐ you
wouldn't believe the half of it.

34:34.557 --> 34:36.795
‐KIMBERLY: Regina!
‐She met with Ted Campbell

34:36.828 --> 34:39.433
the night before the men died.
Maybe she knew what was coming.

34:39.466 --> 34:41.437
Maybe they all did.

34:41.470 --> 34:43.408
‐The Washington elite.
‐MALIKA: Shut up!

34:43.441 --> 34:45.846
‐What are you doing?
‐These people are all guilty.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.850
I'm the one
you should be dealing with.

34:47.884 --> 34:51.525
Stop! Shut up! Enough bullshit!

34:51.558 --> 34:53.261
Jennifer's son is alive!

34:53.294 --> 34:55.633
She killed two soldiers
to keep it quiet.

34:55.666 --> 34:57.670
(screaming)

34:57.704 --> 35:00.108
Oh, my...

35:02.714 --> 35:04.751
(panting)

35:07.189 --> 35:08.692
BETH:
What are...

35:08.726 --> 35:10.161
WOMAN:
God!

35:10.195 --> 35:11.498
(woman whimpering)

35:12.500 --> 35:15.138
(retching, gasping)

35:17.309 --> 35:20.281
(loud, wheezy panting)

35:22.386 --> 35:24.490
BETH:
What did you...

35:24.524 --> 35:26.260
Bring the body outside.

35:26.294 --> 35:29.266
Tell them she's next
if they don't back off!

35:30.636 --> 35:33.308
They'll be here any minute.
What are you waiting for? Go!

35:33.341 --> 35:35.312
‐Malika...
‐Okay, we need to buy time.

35:35.345 --> 35:37.449
You just... I mean, you...

35:37.482 --> 35:38.819
What did you think would happen?

35:38.852 --> 35:40.188
We walk in here,
no one gets hurt?

35:40.221 --> 35:41.457
This is the fucking Pentagon!

35:41.490 --> 35:43.227
‐You said no one would get...
‐There is no

35:43.261 --> 35:45.198
government without these people!

35:45.231 --> 35:46.568
It is that simple.

35:46.601 --> 35:48.204
You want to start over?

35:48.237 --> 35:50.609
You want real change?

35:50.643 --> 35:52.412
This is it.

35:54.283 --> 35:57.189
She's next. Tell them!

35:57.222 --> 35:58.859
(Christine panting)

36:08.344 --> 36:09.647
SONIA:
Yorick?

36:09.681 --> 36:11.651
Sorry. What?

36:11.685 --> 36:13.488
SONIA:
Your hands are disgusting.

36:13.522 --> 36:16.762
Yeah, it's the apocalypse.

36:16.795 --> 36:20.268
Oh, no. What? What is this?

36:20.301 --> 36:22.807
You're in the hands...

36:22.840 --> 36:25.245
of a licensed cosmetologist.

36:25.278 --> 36:27.784
Ah, well, that is reassuring.

36:27.817 --> 36:29.521
(chuckles)

36:29.554 --> 36:31.357
They kept trying to put me
on license plates,

36:31.390 --> 36:34.396
but I'd fuck up so they'd
send me back to the salon.

36:34.430 --> 36:37.904
We had this one type of lotion.
It was called "Freshscent."

36:37.937 --> 36:40.241
‐It smelled like
fucking floor wax.
‐Uh‐huh.

36:40.275 --> 36:42.780
This...

36:42.814 --> 36:44.784
is coconut.

36:44.818 --> 36:47.422
‐(laughs)
‐It's... it's...

36:47.456 --> 36:49.259
(laughing):
It smells like sunscreen.

36:49.293 --> 36:52.967
(laughs)
Well, I have, uh,
lavender upstairs, or...

36:53.000 --> 36:57.375
‐orange blossom.
‐Um...

36:57.409 --> 36:58.779
Yeah.

37:00.315 --> 37:02.720
So this all belonged
to someone, right?

37:02.754 --> 37:04.490
Like, somebody lived here?

37:05.860 --> 37:07.864
(sighs)

37:08.932 --> 37:10.669
Um, hey, I'm sure that you guys
did what you had to do...

37:10.703 --> 37:12.673
You're sure? How?

37:15.713 --> 37:18.852
Uh, you can't... you can't
just ask people shit like that.

37:18.886 --> 37:21.691
(Sonia sighs)

37:21.725 --> 37:24.430
All right, um,

37:24.463 --> 37:27.737
the guards were men... mostly.

37:27.770 --> 37:30.308
We were in the yard
when it happened.

37:30.341 --> 37:32.412
At first, the women thought
we did it,

37:32.446 --> 37:34.316
but then, they were outnumbered,

37:34.349 --> 37:37.757
scared, so they locked us in.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.727
Left us.

37:39.761 --> 37:41.698
It was days.

37:41.731 --> 37:43.401
Jesus.

37:43.434 --> 37:44.938
So, once we broke out,
they were waiting

37:44.971 --> 37:46.875
for us with guns.

37:46.908 --> 37:50.281
They were so scared,
they forgot that we were people.

37:52.385 --> 37:54.591
Us or them.

37:59.901 --> 38:01.905
I'm sorry.

38:01.938 --> 38:03.842
‐Maybe it won't last.
‐I‐I mean,

38:03.876 --> 38:06.915
‐crazier things
have happened, right?
‐Mm.

38:06.948 --> 38:08.919
I mean, half the world died.

38:08.952 --> 38:10.723
That was pretty weird.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.259
(both laugh softly)

38:16.066 --> 38:18.872
Maybe you're right.
Who knows?

38:18.906 --> 38:21.277
Maybe we'll get lucky.

38:28.357 --> 38:30.763
ALLISON:
You're tall.

38:30.796 --> 38:34.336
That one‐‐ "Carla Summer."

38:38.411 --> 38:40.448
(Agent 355 groans)

38:41.417 --> 38:43.487
Is that from the crash?

38:43.522 --> 38:45.759
No.

38:49.501 --> 38:53.909
Some of my, uh, research
is... controversial.

38:53.942 --> 38:57.015
And sometimes, I'm the only
willing participant.

38:57.048 --> 38:59.888
You did that to yourself?

38:59.921 --> 39:01.357
Uh‐huh.

39:05.064 --> 39:07.637
(laughs)
What's wrong with your clothes?

39:07.670 --> 39:10.408
Oh, they smell like road sweat.

39:10.441 --> 39:13.381
‐That shit doesn't wash out.
‐Hmm.

39:16.453 --> 39:18.792
I'm going back
to check on Dominique.

39:19.961 --> 39:21.932
Seriously?

39:21.965 --> 39:23.936
Tall? Grumpy?

39:24.971 --> 39:27.042
Not as grumpy as you.

39:27.075 --> 39:28.411
She sounds great.

39:28.444 --> 39:29.681
‐Mm. She hates us.
‐Mm.

39:29.714 --> 39:31.685
Thought
I'd put in some face time,

39:31.718 --> 39:34.089
assess the threat level.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.091
(soft chuckle)

39:35.124 --> 39:37.897
Well, you need backup?

39:39.901 --> 39:41.938
You'd scare her off.

39:44.877 --> 39:48.084
Also, there's an outside chance
I'll get laid.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.727
No, no, no, no, don't do that.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.697
I fuck who I want, okay?

39:54.731 --> 39:58.004
‐Well, I didn't say...
‐No, it was right there.

39:58.037 --> 40:02.847
You think you're a good liar,
but you're not.

40:02.880 --> 40:05.986
It wouldn't kill you
to be less judgmental.

40:07.022 --> 40:09.527
‐She was a getaway driver.
‐(laughs airily)

40:11.531 --> 40:13.735
It's not like she killed anyone.

40:25.224 --> 40:27.429
What's up with you?

40:30.903 --> 40:32.439
(Agent 355 laughs airily)

40:34.209 --> 40:35.913
That one.

40:35.946 --> 40:38.150
Mm.

40:38.184 --> 40:39.520
‐You like?
‐Mm.

40:39.554 --> 40:41.758
‐Great.
‐Huh? Ah.

40:41.791 --> 40:44.129
FRAN:
Pull yourself together.

40:46.701 --> 40:48.538
They are watching us.

40:48.572 --> 40:51.010
(sobbing)
Shit.

40:52.078 --> 40:54.049
(crying)

40:55.251 --> 40:57.623
(whimpering)

40:59.259 --> 41:01.196
(Agent 355 panting)

41:01.230 --> 41:03.602
You...

41:03.635 --> 41:06.040
did everything
you were supposed to do.

41:06.073 --> 41:08.645
(laughing):
You...

41:08.679 --> 41:10.516
were brilliant!

41:10.549 --> 41:13.889
Most never make it past
screening, let alone training.

41:13.922 --> 41:16.828
The ones that do
are exceptional.

41:16.861 --> 41:19.734
None of them comes close to you.

41:21.738 --> 41:23.775
You are better than this!

41:26.848 --> 41:28.785
(exhales, inhales)

41:33.862 --> 41:36.200
They tell you,

41:36.233 --> 41:40.909
"Work hard, follow the rules,

41:40.943 --> 41:42.646
you can make something
of yourself."

41:44.116 --> 41:46.988
That's not how it works.

41:47.022 --> 41:49.961
You never had a real chance.

41:49.994 --> 41:52.600
It is important

41:52.633 --> 41:55.539
to see the world as it is.

41:55.572 --> 41:59.112
This is your leg up in a world

41:59.146 --> 42:02.252
that isn't built for you.

We're gonna track down

46:02.800 --> 46:04.804
Wipe 'em out. There's hundreds.

This is proof.

Uh, we need a place

Small ball, Nora.
You think small.

46:12.953 --> 46:16.259
None of this is real.
I mean, what the fuck?

46:16.293 --> 46:17.395
Know what your problem is, Nora?

46:17.428 --> 46:20.535
Vision. Got no vision.

46:20.569 --> 46:23.541
This isn't a game for me.
Men ruined my life.

46:23.575 --> 46:25.545
Every last one
of them deserves to die.

world can't change.

You're sad and you're scared,

is a place to hide.

Goddamn it!

46:54.035 --> 46:57.509
I told you, I saw a man
in a market near Boston.

46:57.543 --> 46:59.547
I know what I fucking saw.

46:59.580 --> 47:01.316
His bodyguard shot my sister
in the leg, okay?

47:01.350 --> 47:04.022
She can't walk. Hey, other
people have seen him, too,

47:04.055 --> 47:06.426
not just me! He's nearby.

47:06.460 --> 47:09.099
A town with electricity.

47:09.132 --> 47:13.173
Electricity? How?

47:13.207 --> 47:14.844
Been there?

47:14.877 --> 47:17.415
I've heard stories.
It's not far.

47:17.448 --> 47:19.486
I'm right on his heels.

47:22.091 --> 47:24.129
(wind howling)

47:30.942 --> 47:34.015
(laughter,
indistinct chatter)

47:36.486 --> 47:39.025
You're right.

47:39.059 --> 47:40.996
We should do it.

47:41.029 --> 47:43.267
The men. This one first.

47:43.300 --> 47:44.904
Enough with the apologies, Nora.

47:44.937 --> 47:46.173
No, you're right.

47:46.206 --> 47:48.177
About me.

47:49.212 --> 47:50.615
I am scared.

47:50.649 --> 47:52.886
It's holding me back.

47:59.967 --> 48:01.938
Why him?

48:01.971 --> 48:03.575
He's nearby.

48:03.608 --> 48:06.379
Town with food, electricity,
everything we need.

48:06.413 --> 48:09.486
At least that's the story.
If it's true...

48:09.520 --> 48:11.624
He wears a gas mask,

48:11.657 --> 48:13.628
travels with a bodyguard.

48:13.661 --> 48:15.532
People remember him.

48:21.076 --> 48:23.046
He can't hide.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.217
Not from us.

48:32.398 --> 48:34.469
