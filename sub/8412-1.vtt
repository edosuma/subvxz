WEBVTT

04:00.991 --> 04:03.075
Hey!

04:06.747 --> 04:11.000
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Come along!

04:11.210 --> 04:13.085
Come on, let them go.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.338
Come on.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.220
Hey, go on.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.437
Hey, come along.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.440
Come on, Toby. That's it.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.039
Whoa.

04:50.249 --> 04:53.167
Don't look too bad, do it?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.587
Father, I've decided to go.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.714
I was afraid of that.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.842
- And Alice?
- She's determined to come.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.762
No place for her. Ha!

05:37.879 --> 05:39.755
Thank you, Angus.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.678
Here we are.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.934
- Damn the boy.
- He lost the race.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.532
Don't fret over her. She's strong
enough to withstand a year in the tropics.

06:06.742 --> 06:09.577
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

06:12.122 --> 06:16.083
Forgive me if I don't come
and see you off.

06:18.253 --> 06:21.547
I'd make a fool of myself down there.

06:22.341 --> 06:26.385
Well, I've written
a few letters for you.

06:26.595 --> 06:30.348
Might... Might be helpful on your way.

06:30.557 --> 06:34.310
There's one to Uncle Bill here.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.323
See here, Father...

06:47.532 --> 06:50.409
...we'll be all right, I promise.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.787
Give me your hand.

06:54.081 --> 06:59.752
Of course you will.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.933
Hello, Jane.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.103
I found something for you in London.

07:17.312 --> 07:20.231
- A little scarab ring.
- Thank you.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.404
- Darling, we'll be late.
- Yes.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.031
Does that mean we'll marry, Uncle Jack?

07:29.241 --> 07:31.033
No, it doesn't. I'm already married.

07:31.243 --> 07:34.995
But we won't just give you to some
Tom, Dick or Harry from Baltimore.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.457
We shall find someone suitable,
preferably an Englishman.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.461
There you are, nanny.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.298
Thank you. Goodbye.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.141
Take care of him.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.560
- Safe journey.
- Thank you.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.187
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.814
Goodbye.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.693
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, my lord.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.441
Jack?

09:28.443 --> 09:35.032
Jack?

09:37.369 --> 09:39.370
Jack!

09:43.833 --> 09:56.095
Where's Jack?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.931
He was alive last night.
Where is he?

09:59.140 --> 10:03.477
It's not my fault.

10:03.687 --> 10:07.189
Where is Lord Clayton?

10:07.399 --> 10:09.149
It's not my fault.

10:09.818 --> 10:13.821
They'll blame me,
but it's not my fault.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.326
It's not my fault.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.623
Jack.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.209
Jack!

10:28.670 --> 10:31.297
- Oh, Jack.
- It's all right.

10:32.007 --> 10:35.467
Shh. All right, all right.
It's all right, darling.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.220
I was so frightened.
I thought you drowned.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.598
It's all right.

10:42.767 --> 10:46.228
I was trying to help him. It's too late.

10:47.981 --> 10:52.151
- Poor boy.
- Come on. Come on.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.518
December the 17th, 1885.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.104
It is almost 10 months
since the shipwreck...

11:29.314 --> 11:32.316
...and Captain Billings left us
to find help.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.444
As each week passes,
I have to face up to the fact...

11:35.654 --> 11:38.947
...that the poor man must have
perished in the attempt.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.247
The apes have returned
in greater numbers this time.

11:47.666 --> 11:52.127
They eat everything in the vicinity,
so food will be hard to find.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.339
But at least they leave us alone.

12:17.946 --> 12:21.699
The difficult birth of our son,
followed by a bout of malaria...

12:21.908 --> 12:24.910
...has weakened my darling Alice terribly.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.206
While the baby howls at the world
and every day grows stronger...

12:29.999 --> 12:32.710
...she shows little sign of recovery.

12:33.211 --> 12:38.382
The fever has robbed her of her milk
and clouded her perception.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.219
She still believes that we are
safely home in Scotland.

12:42.637 --> 12:48.726
In a way, I'm grateful, as this delusion
spares her the reality of our predicament.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.147
There, there.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.237
Alice?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.079
Alice.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.915
Oh, no.

13:23.178 --> 13:30.184
Alice.

32:57.059 --> 33:01.479
We have been traveling these
dank rivers of West Africa for months...

33:01.688 --> 33:05.816
...amassing an inventory of fauna
for the British Museum.

33:06.026 --> 33:10.071
I am the only Belgian among the English,
pressed on them by my superiors...

33:10.280 --> 33:11.739
...to guide them and watch them.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.453
Got him.

33:19.039 --> 33:21.457
- What is it?
- Don't know.

33:22.376 --> 33:24.377
But it might have been something.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.797
Yes, major...

33:28.256 --> 33:30.675
...but now it is a dead something.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.843
Of course it is.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.778
Heavens.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.670
What are they saying, D'Arnot?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.174
Dinner est servi.

34:13.092 --> 34:18.848
No. Arrived. "Dinner has arrived"
is a slightly better translation.

34:19.181 --> 34:22.059
I don't think that's
frightfully funny, D'Arnot.

34:23.103 --> 34:25.438
My companions consider themselves...

34:25.647 --> 34:28.107
...to be the foremost
among God's creatures...

34:28.315 --> 34:32.902
...and treat Africa and all things African
with an unwavering contempt.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.487
If I wasn't under orders...

34:34.697 --> 34:38.159
...I'd have abandoned them at week one
and returned to Brussels.

34:38.368 --> 34:41.704
You drop that box again
and I'll shoot you.

35:31.505 --> 35:34.548
Come on! Apes! Belcher!

35:35.509 --> 35:39.303
- Come on!
- I thought I said there was to be no...

35:39.805 --> 35:43.057
Well, at least try not
to damage the skins!

35:43.266 --> 35:45.226
Major!

35:45.435 --> 35:47.103
Damn them.

35:56.530 --> 35:59.031
Major Downing!

36:16.716 --> 36:20.427
There, Major Jack.
They're going into the trees!

36:21.596 --> 36:24.098
Come on. Come on. They're beauties.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.933
Downing!

36:46.079 --> 36:47.538
Be quick or we'll lose it.

36:47.747 --> 36:48.998
Downing!

36:49.207 --> 36:52.209
Fire one more shot, you butcher,
and I'll shoot you.

36:54.421 --> 36:58.757
Steady, old chap.
It's all in a day's sport.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.181
Sport and blood, Sir Evelyn.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.935
Stuff of life.

37:23.033 --> 37:25.117
Good God.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.767
"John...

37:51.561 --> 37:53.395
...Clayton."

37:54.814 --> 37:58.525
John Clayton.
It's the Earl of Greystoke's son.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.616
Good God.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.539
So this is what became of him.

38:22.008 --> 38:26.804
- Those blasted drums, Belcher.
- Yes, Major Jack.

38:28.181 --> 38:32.393
- Have you got a finger in the bullet hole?
- Yes, major.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.481
Major Jack.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.869
Pygmies!

39:57.228 --> 39:59.730
Back. Back to the boat!

40:16.706 --> 40:19.750
Sir Evelyn!

40:20.418 --> 40:23.379
Where are you?

42:18.953 --> 42:21.330
Aide-moi, papa.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.295
Papa.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.602
Qui Ãªtes-vous?

43:27.063 --> 43:29.273
Who are...

43:30.650 --> 43:32.985
Who are you?

43:34.737 --> 43:37.573
Sir, help me.

43:38.241 --> 43:42.077
Say something.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.813
Mon Dieu!

44:31.836 --> 44:34.087
Pourquoi...

49:15.077 --> 49:16.703
Back!

54:39.568 --> 54:41.694
Pas possible.

55:40.296 --> 55:42.672
- Incroyable.
- Croy.

55:46.510 --> 55:47.552
Eh?

55:51.015 --> 55:53.057
- Oui!
- Oui!

56:12.578 --> 56:17.665
Razor. Razor.

56:19.126 --> 56:20.543
Razor.

56:23.255 --> 56:26.049
Razor! Razor!

56:33.349 --> 56:34.932
Razor.

56:42.816 --> 56:44.567
Raz...

56:48.238 --> 56:49.906
Razor.

56:52.910 --> 56:54.494
Ra...

56:58.082 --> 56:59.707
Raz...

57:01.251 --> 57:02.877
Razo...

57:05.422 --> 57:07.090
Raz...

57:10.469 --> 57:12.553
Razor.

57:14.139 --> 57:17.308
- Razor.
- Razor.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.227
Razor.

57:21.271 --> 57:22.772
Yes.

58:09.528 --> 58:13.156
- Razor, razor.
- No.

58:15.492 --> 58:18.286
- No. No, no razor.
- Ra...

58:18.495 --> 58:22.165
Mirror. Mirror.

58:25.335 --> 58:29.213
Mm. Mm. Mi. Mi.

58:30.883 --> 58:33.885
- Mirror, mirror.
- Mirror. Mirror.

58:34.094 --> 58:36.637
Mirror. Mirror.

58:38.807 --> 58:41.184
Yes. Mirror.

58:46.857 --> 58:49.567
- Mirror.
- Mirror.

58:50.986 --> 58:55.573
John is a mimic of uncanny ability.

58:55.782 --> 58:57.074
Yes.

58:57.910 --> 59:01.621
Words became like magic tricks to him.

59:01.830 --> 59:08.127
And in six months, he has managed
to grasp the rudiments of the language.

59:08.337 --> 59:11.672
But now I have to convince him
of who he is.

59:12.257 --> 59:15.218
Indeed, what he is!

59:15.427 --> 59:18.721
Mirror. Razor, razor. Mirror.

59:18.931 --> 59:21.057
No. No, no, no.

59:22.851 --> 59:25.394
Man. Man.

59:25.604 --> 59:27.230
Dieu!

59:27.940 --> 59:36.739
Animal. Animal.

59:40.786 --> 59:44.830
- Animal! Animal!
- No, no, no. Animal. Animal. Animal.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.875
- Animal. Animal.
- Animal.

59:48.085 --> 59:50.920
Animal. Animal. Animal.

59:51.129 --> 59:53.548
Animal!

59:54.800 --> 59:56.592
Phillippe.

59:57.970 --> 01:00:00.721
Phillippe D'Arnot.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.561
John.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.938
Clayton.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:21.534
Your home.

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:26.038
Greystoke.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:30.293
Mother. Father.

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:33.879
Father. Mother.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:38.467
Family. Yes, family. Not:

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:44.473
That is your mother.
That is your father, I tell you.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:50.104
Family, John. Mother, father.
Mother, father.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.440
Family!

01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:04.035
Listen to me, John.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:08.122
How many other white apes
have you seen?

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:11.375
You're like me, not them.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:18.007
You have another family, far away.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.803
One you have never seen. Like me.

01:01:23.555 --> 01:01:27.141
Soon I must go to my family.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:29.518
Why?

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:32.688
Dead.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.316
Who is dead?

01:01:36.485 --> 01:01:37.985
Dead.

01:01:38.654 --> 01:01:41.197
Dead like mine. Yours dead.

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.034
Why do you say that?

01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:51.916
If not dead, why you here?

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.377
Because I'm lost.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.923
And I'm looking for her.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.555
And my mother looks for me.

01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:13.396
His mind was able to grasp
the concept of past and present.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:17.233
But he desperately resisted the notion
that his mother...

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:19.985
...might have been anything other
than an ape.

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:22.655
No. No, no.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:25.574
No!

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.921
As for the future...

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:42.717
...it was something that
simply did not exist for him.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.928
And I could never
make him understand...

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:50.975
...that I had another life waiting for me
in another world...

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:53.686
...and another time.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:18.085
John. Mother. Father.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.672
Father. Mother.

01:03:21.882 --> 01:03:25.676
Family, John. How many other
white apes have you seen?

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:31.056
You are like me, not them.
Like me, like me. Not them.

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:35.144
- Father. Father.
- No.

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:40.983
Mother, mother.
Family. Yes, family.

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:46.030
That is your mother.
That is your father, I tell you.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:51.076
Family, John. Mother. Father.
Mother. Father.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:55.790
Family, family.
Father, mother. Mother, father.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:58.667
Family. Family. Family.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.115
Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:48.777
Animal. Animal.

01:06:14.763 --> 01:06:17.681
Six taps this time, huh?

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:19.683
But nine the next.

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:25.814
- So don't do it again, eh?
- No, sir.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.837
Boy, please.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:52.549
May I have some water, please?

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.347
Thank you.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:03.519
Put something on, old boy.

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.522
One of the rules.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:11.360
Got to keep a sense of decorum.
Otherwise we'll all end up like savages.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:13.487
Well...

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:19.159
Thank you, sir.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.704
John.

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:48.772
I'm Buller, the proprietor.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:55.571
Capitaine Phillippe D'Arnot.

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.072
Belgian.

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:08.751
John.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:14.089
My friend is also Belgian,
but he has no English.

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.968
Presumably...

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:22.389
...you want a room?
- Yes, please, sir.

01:08:23.183 --> 01:08:24.725
You fellows here for long?

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:28.228
Well...

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:39.990
Thank you, sir.

01:08:56.508 --> 01:09:00.844
This is not the world, John,
just the edge of it.

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:04.807
- Convicts?
- I don't think so.

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:08.352
- I would bet on it.
- Animals, more like.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.522
Very nasty monkeys, old boy.

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:21.198
You see, John...

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:26.495
...we haven't changed places. This...

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.667
Look.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.765
Fire, John. Fire.

01:09:46.975 --> 01:09:48.058
Oh! Oh!

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:56.608
Come and sit down, capitaine.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:01.864
That's a nine, you miss a go.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.709
Ah, capitaine.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:16.044
Captain Billings you have met, yes?

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:18.964
He's been here longer than any of us.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:23.260
Now the rest of the gentlemen.
We have Jeffson Brown.

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.679
Olivestone.

01:10:27.015 --> 01:10:28.765
Stimson.

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:30.976
Chalky White.

01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:34.021
And that's Mrs. White on his shoulder.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:37.649
I hear you've lost all your belongings.

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:39.359
Yes.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:41.570
Where did that happen?

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:43.488
In the north.

01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:45.616
Come now, Mr. D'Arnot.

01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:48.202
Where are you really from?

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.997
I was a member
of a zoological expedition...

01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:55.167
...funded by the British Museum.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:57.878
Several months ago we were attacked.

01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:01.590
I urgently need to return to Europe...

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:05.802
...but unfortunately I have no funds.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:11.433
However, I can leave you
a promissory note.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:17.731
Well, the last frog we had through here
couldn't pay his bills either.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:22.945
We turned him over to French authorities,
who were jolly pleased to have him back.

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:25.614
Turned out to be a convict.

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.832
I can assure you, sir...

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.752
...that I am no criminal.

01:11:40.088 --> 01:11:42.297
Then what are you?

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.592
I'm an explorer.

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:48.303
What a liar.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:56.311
I think that deserves
a thrashing, don't you?

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.147
Six.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.695
John! John!

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:23.672
Fire. Fire. Fire!

01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:02.878
I sense that we have a long
and difficult journey ahead of us.

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:08.050
Perhaps weeks of waiting for a ship
that will give us passage to England.

01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:11.428
I will try to teach John
some rudimentary manners...

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:14.473
...and a greater understanding
of the language.

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:20.062
Like a father, I am resolved
to impart to him all that I can.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:24.441
But never, not even for a moment,
do I doubt that to take him back...

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.943
...is a perilous undertaking.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.781
For John...

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.241
...but also for his family.

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:37.204
Apes, did you say?

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.706
Apes?

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:43.585
I can't believe it.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:50.425
The coffee, Sir Evelyn, the coffee.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:54.596
It's an extraordinary example
of man's superiority over beast.

01:13:54.806 --> 01:14:00.102
Not only did he survive, he made himself
their master. Their lord, as it were.

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:02.437
Is he...? Is he sound?

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:05.357
Is he...? Is he normal?

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:08.443
Well, I'm told he's a remarkable...

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.948
...young man.

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:16.952
But apes.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.626
Welcome home, my lord.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.838
- This fellow D'Arnot...
- D'Arnot.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:31.299
D'Arnot. Deserves recognition.

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:33.844
Do you suppose
we could get him a medal...

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.221
...from the Royal Geographical Society?

01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:40.517
Do you think he'd appreciate that?
All right, all right. I can manage.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.728
I don't wish to belittle
D'Arnot's contribution...

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.440
...but he was merely a part
of an expedition.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:49.192
A British expedition.

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:53.488
Laurels for this extraordinary achievement
belong to the expedition itself...

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:55.198
...not the individual.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:15:00.829
In any case, although the circumstances
indicate that he is your grandson...

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.789
...we can't prove it.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:07.794
Of course, we might be able to do so
if we were able to make tests.

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.671
He's here.

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:15.302
If he's a Greystoke,
I'll know him at a glance.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:54.216
Johnny?

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:56.885
Is that you?

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:00.055
Come out and show yourself.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:24.955
Oh, my boy.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:31.419
My dear, dear boy.

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:45.267
Sir, I thank you with all my heart.

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.795
Come.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:19.884
Welcome, welcome.

01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:24.014
Hasn't changed a jot, has it?

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.976
Well, come on up.

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.270
We'll take you to your room.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:38.403
- I wonder if you'll find it cold up there.
- D'Arnot.

01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:41.114
Sir Evelyn. Excuse me.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.325
We must talk.

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:49.122
Ah. Do you recognize her?

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.666
How could he recognize me, uncle?

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:53.543
We've never met.

01:17:53.753 --> 01:17:55.670
Welcome home, Lord Clayton.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.507
Ah. Of course, of course.
I keep thinking he's my son.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:02.177
This is Jane, from America.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:06.014
My ward. I'm looking after her.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.979
Your father gave me this.

01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:16.232
Elle est jolie.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:18.860
She's pretty.

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:20.695
Yes, she is.

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:22.697
This is Monsieur D'Arnot.

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:25.992
Monsieur D'Arnot, it's a great day for us.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:29.037
Sir Evelyn told us all you've done
for Lord Clayton.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:31.831
No more than he has done for me.

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:37.379
You must be tired after your journey.

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:39.839
- Well...
- Well, come on, Johnny.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:42.884
We'll show you to your room.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.346
Look out for these stairs.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:48.556
They're slippery.

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:55.897
When I was a child, I'd slide down here
on a tray from the nursery.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:05.865
Come on, Johnny.

01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:10.620
Come on this way.

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:13.998
This was your father's room.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.085
That's your father.

01:19:18.129 --> 01:19:19.879
Fine soldier.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:22.090
That's your mother.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.302
Pretty girl.

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:46.781
Can...? Can he read English?

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:48.658
Oh, yes, sir, a little.

01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:50.827
"John Clayton.

01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:54.080
Junior house, Eton.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.541
For the long jump.

01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:59.210
1870."

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.713
The long jump.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:05.049
The mighty leap.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:06.801
Damn silly, really.

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:13.266
I can't say what it means to me...

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.685
...to have you with me.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:19.564
Well...

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:23.651
Till dinner, then.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.737
Yes.

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:28.031
Thank you, sir.

01:20:53.808 --> 01:20:56.684
- Good evening, Lord Esker.
- Evening, Dean.

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:58.353
Hello.

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:04.776
- You look absolutely gorgeous.
- Thank you, Charles.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:09.364
- She's rather smart, isn't she?
- She's beautiful.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.324
Austin. The eight cylinder.

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:15.370
- Do you know Johnny's here?
- Oh.

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:24.546
John. John.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:34.013
Oh, quite right, quite right.
I hate spoons.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:41.312
Bravo.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:43.523
Well done, your lordship.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:46.276
Oh, welcome home, Johnny.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:51.364
Can't help saying it over and over.
Welcome home, Johnny.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:53.825
- Welcome home.
- To Johnny.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.163
We are already at a disadvantage...

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:02.584
...because it's several months
since he left the wild.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:06.421
My colleagues and I wish to examine him
at the earliest opportunity.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.131
Science demands it.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.802
I think you will find, Sir Evelyn,
that Lord Clayton has a mind of his own.

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:15.263
- Of course.
- Then you should ask him.

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:18.266
I shouldn't let the scientists
poke you about.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:21.769
Best plan would be to get him to school.
Eton for a year or two.

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:24.606
I think he's been away long enough.
Don't you?

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:27.650
Yes. I have.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:31.195
Did you know, sir,
that they have these little men, Pygmies?

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.281
Pigs, did you say?

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:44.334
It's high.
Been left to hang a couple of weeks.

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:47.837
It's a bit of an acquired taste, really.
But do try some.

01:22:48.047 --> 01:22:49.714
Close to rotten, really.

01:22:49.924 --> 01:22:52.884
You don't have to eat it
if you don't want to.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.057
Ãa sent...
Ãa sent pas trÃ¨s bon.

01:22:59.934 --> 01:23:02.936
- English.
- No, thank you.

01:23:03.354 --> 01:23:07.315
- Won't be long before you talk like us.
- I hope not.

01:23:07.524 --> 01:23:11.653
I think English is so much prettier when
spoken with a French accent, don't you?

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:13.696
Oh, nonsense.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:18.868
"Won't be long
before you're talking like the rest of us."

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:25.458
"It's a bit of an acquired taste, really.
But do try some."

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:29.337
- That's quite remarkable.
- It could be you, Esker.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:32.340
That was marvelous, John.
That was perfect.

01:23:32.967 --> 01:23:38.304
John is an excellent mimic. Any animal
that he has heard, parfaitement.

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:41.849
How wonderful.
What animals can you do?

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.186
Please, can I hear one?

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:57.865
This is a game that
we used to play onboard the ship.

01:23:58.325 --> 01:24:00.493
He used to enchant the crew.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:05.456
The best thing is if you close your eyes
and imagine that you are en Afrique.

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:07.709
Yes. In Africa.

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:19.303
It's beautiful.

01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:21.723
Do another one.

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:23.933
Close your eyes.

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:43.911
John!

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:47.040
Very realistic.

01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:54.630
I hope you'll come see us...

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.259
...at the earliest opportunity,
Monsieur D'Arnot.

01:24:58.469 --> 01:25:01.763
Of course I will, sir.
Thank you very much.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:08.019
Jane, Jane. Goodbye.

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:13.107
- Look after him, yes?
- I will, Phillippe.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:18.946
I will be back, John, I promise.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:21.949
And by then you will have forgotten
all your French.

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:23.701
No.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.460
Au revoir.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:47.475
Razor.

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:54.107
Mirror.

01:25:59.113 --> 01:26:00.738
Au revoir.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:15.211
Good rule to follow, John:

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.172
Never shed a tear in public.

01:26:18.382 --> 01:26:20.675
Charles, sometimes you're so cruel.

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:22.552
Am I right?

01:26:30.227 --> 01:26:31.811
He's a good runner, isn't he?

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:35.439
Phillippe! Phillippe!

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.283
Kidneys.

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:54.412
Hope you won't be leaving us now,
my dear.

01:28:54.621 --> 01:29:00.209
That fat aunt of yours in Baltimore
is missing you, I understand.

01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:02.295
- Kedgeree.
- No, uncle.

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:04.463
I'd rather stay here for the winter.

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:06.507
Try to teach Johnny some more.

01:29:07.134 --> 01:29:09.302
Good girl.

01:29:10.053 --> 01:29:12.555
What do you think of that, Johnny?

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.849
- I think it's very good.
- A-ha.

01:29:15.976 --> 01:29:17.893
Tomatoes.

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:27.111
Oh, kippers too, yes.

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:37.997
Porridge with everything.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:40.124
I'll have some myself.

01:29:45.464 --> 01:29:49.925
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:57.767
One, two, three.

01:29:57.976 --> 01:29:59.727
Oh, John.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:04.732
- Charles.
- Charles.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.360
Good afternoon.

01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:10.738
- Dancing class?
- Yes. He's a wonderful dancer.

01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:13.240
Good.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.535
Amavero.

01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:18.412
Johnny.

01:30:20.207 --> 01:30:21.207
- Amavero.
- Amavero.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:26.504
- Amaveris.
- Amaveris.

01:30:27.047 --> 01:30:28.297
- Amaverit.
- Verit.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:32.176
Amavero. "I shall have loved."

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:35.221
Amaveris.

01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:37.848
"Thou wilt have loved."

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:39.892
Amaverit.

01:30:40.102 --> 01:30:42.686
"He will have loved."

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:55.908
Did you catch it?

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:01.163
Let it go.

01:31:25.772 --> 01:31:28.023
Just look there. Look.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:43.664
Johnny?

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:51.172
Johnny.

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:06.020
What's that?

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:11.233
What?

01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:17.239
Infernal machine!

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:21.535
Charles.

01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:27.208
- I didn't expect to see you today.
- Jane.

01:32:27.417 --> 01:32:29.877
- Good hunting?
- Wonderful.

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:37.426
I came because I have something
rather important to discuss with you.

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:39.261
Oh?

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:42.598
I noticed, as did my uncle,
who remarked on it...

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:47.895
...that Clayton's become attached to you,
in a somewhat puppy-ish sort of way.

01:32:48.104 --> 01:32:52.525
I think that's understandable.
He's alone, a little lost.

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:55.277
Mm. Of course.

01:32:55.695 --> 01:32:58.906
But I could not help notice that
you appear to be fond of him.

01:32:59.115 --> 01:33:00.616
I am, Charles.

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:02.451
I am fond of him.

01:33:02.702 --> 01:33:04.119
But no more than that?

01:33:04.329 --> 01:33:06.372
- No more than fond?
- No.

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:08.624
Why would you ask?

01:33:09.626 --> 01:33:12.628
I hope he's not become
too dependent on you.

01:33:13.046 --> 01:33:15.756
Especially in view of
what I'm about to say.

01:33:15.966 --> 01:33:17.508
Yes?

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:21.262
We've spent enough time together
to know that we're well-suited.

01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:23.347
I've become very attached to you.

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:27.768
I want your permission to ask
Lord Greystoke for your hand.

01:33:29.396 --> 01:33:30.854
Jane...

01:33:31.565 --> 01:33:32.773
...will you marry me?

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:41.282
Thank you, Dean.
I can manage that.

01:33:41.783 --> 01:33:43.659
As you wish, ma'am.

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.132
This is most unexpected, Charles.

01:33:58.508 --> 01:34:00.426
But my answer is no.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:02.595
Absolutely no.

01:34:03.513 --> 01:34:05.139
No?

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:10.519
Three months ago, before Clayton
returned, I doubt you'd have hesitated.

01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:12.730
- That is not true.
- I think it is.

01:34:12.939 --> 01:34:14.690
It has nothing to do with John.

01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:19.153
I'm not in love with you, Charles.
That is all.

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.622
I'm sorry, Charles.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:34:59.360
Ow!

01:35:36.856 --> 01:35:39.400
You've got a lot to learn, jungle man.

01:36:08.555 --> 01:36:10.431
Hey, hey.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.099
Come on, Willy.

01:36:14.394 --> 01:36:16.603
You're doing fine.

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:22.943
Hello, hello, my corky.

01:36:23.153 --> 01:36:25.738
Hello, hello, below.

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:30.159
When I've got one fish,
I'd like another, you know.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:34.371
I like fishing, Grandpa.

01:36:34.581 --> 01:36:36.206
I like fishing.

01:36:36.416 --> 01:36:39.668
Oh, he's an old bugger down there.

01:36:39.878 --> 01:36:41.962
I'll never get him up.

01:37:01.775 --> 01:37:03.901
Whoa. Whoa.

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:08.655
Come on, now, and have a look
at the wall.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:19.958
Watch those horses, Willy.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:24.004
He's a bit soft in the head.

01:37:32.597 --> 01:37:35.349
It goes all around the estate.

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.102
Keep them out.

01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:42.397
And keep us in.

01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:46.860
This is yours, Johnny. This estate.

01:37:47.445 --> 01:37:51.615
I've seen other fellows sell off
bits of theirs.

01:37:51.825 --> 01:37:54.159
A little here, a little there.

01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:57.287
That's the rot, Johnny.

01:37:57.497 --> 01:38:02.292
Selling little bits,
chipping away at the edges.

01:38:02.794 --> 01:38:06.046
In the end, they have nothing.

01:38:07.048 --> 01:38:11.218
Never sell. Never, ever sell.

01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:14.513
Do anything to keep it whole.

01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:16.348
You understand me?

01:38:16.558 --> 01:38:19.434
Yourself whole.

01:38:20.854 --> 01:38:25.274
Land is the lifeblood of this family.

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:41.665
Yes, sir.

01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:45.252
Sir.

01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:48.255
Just step this way, please.

01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:53.260
Good evening. Merry Christmas.

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:56.096
Merry Christmas.

01:38:57.307 --> 01:38:58.640
- Hello.
- How do you do?

01:38:58.850 --> 01:39:00.809
Very well, thank you.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:09.568
Dean, I think everyone's here now.
Don't you think so?

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:11.695
Let us hope, sir.

01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:17.910
How do you do?
How do you do? Thank you.

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:22.414
I'm starving.

01:39:25.251 --> 01:39:27.169
- Have you ever had a mince pie?
- No.

01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:28.629
Wonderful.

01:39:28.838 --> 01:39:30.797
You look beautiful tonight.

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:38.513
Whereas, as you all know...

01:39:38.723 --> 01:39:43.602
...this is my favorite gathering
of the year.

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:46.313
Christmas Eve.

01:39:46.522 --> 01:39:50.651
Very often on these occasions
I've very little to say.

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:54.529
But this year is a very special year.

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:59.493
This year my son has returned
from Africa...

01:39:59.702 --> 01:40:03.622
...after many, many years.

01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:07.668
Some people might say
that an old man...

01:40:07.877 --> 01:40:11.171
...shouldn't expect any further blessing.

01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:13.465
And I daresay they might be quite right.

01:40:13.716 --> 01:40:16.009
But I hope for still more.

01:40:16.219 --> 01:40:20.806
One day, I hope to announce
his betrothal.

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:26.019
And following that, his heir.

01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:34.528
Thank you, that's good.

01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:43.161
Well...

01:40:44.372 --> 01:40:46.164
To all of you.

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:32.085
There's my boy. Jolly good.

01:43:01.217 --> 01:43:04.636
Nursery days, nursery days.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.990
Back in the nursery.
A lovely slide.

01:43:27.577 --> 01:43:28.994
Here we go.

01:43:29.203 --> 01:43:31.496
Bumpity, bumpity, bump, bump, bump.

01:43:52.977 --> 01:43:54.853
Somebody must have been taken ill.

01:44:15.458 --> 01:44:19.211
Johnny.

01:44:22.173 --> 01:44:24.049
Let me stay still.

01:44:26.302 --> 01:44:27.802
Now...

01:44:28.638 --> 01:44:31.264
...all I can taste is blood.

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:36.519
You know, I didn't like it
when you went off.

01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:39.814
I'm so glad you came back.

01:44:42.652 --> 01:44:46.029
I think I...
I think I might be going...

01:44:46.239 --> 01:44:49.032
...off myself somewhere.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:58.583
One of these days.

01:46:49.779 --> 01:46:51.905
Jane!

01:47:20.768 --> 01:47:45.625
Jane!

01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:51.631
Jane. Jane.

01:47:57.596 --> 01:48:00.557
Please, Johnny, don't be sad.

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.688
I love you, Johnny.

01:48:07.398 --> 01:48:09.149
I love you.

01:48:59.158 --> 01:49:00.617
Phillippe.

01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:02.994
Jane.

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:12.587
I have missed you, both of you,
so very much.

01:49:16.258 --> 01:49:18.885
- How are you?
- As you see.

01:49:20.554 --> 01:49:22.263
How is he?

01:49:23.807 --> 01:49:26.100
Judge for yourself, Phillippe.

01:49:29.855 --> 01:49:32.398
He'll be so pleased to see you.

01:49:40.241 --> 01:49:41.658
Phillippe.

01:49:42.368 --> 01:49:44.244
We've missed you too.

01:49:53.212 --> 01:49:54.546
John?

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:17.193
Comment vas-tu? Eh?

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.619
John?

01:50:29.957 --> 01:50:31.457
I am alone, Phillippe.

01:50:32.835 --> 01:50:35.128
You brought me here
to look for my family.

01:50:35.337 --> 01:50:37.463
I found an old man.

01:50:37.673 --> 01:50:39.007
Now he's dead.

01:50:39.842 --> 01:50:41.801
This isn't my home.

01:50:43.512 --> 01:50:47.140
- This isn't my home.
- It could be, John.

01:50:49.143 --> 01:50:51.811
You are a human being, a man.

01:50:52.187 --> 01:50:54.814
You must come to terms
with that fact.

01:50:55.357 --> 01:50:57.025
That reality.

01:50:57.234 --> 01:50:59.819
You will never find a home,
be at home...

01:51:00.029 --> 01:51:03.072
...here or in the jungle,
until you do.

01:51:03.282 --> 01:51:07.952
You must overcome
what has happened to you.

01:51:08.329 --> 01:51:11.164
You must transcend
the loss, the pain...

01:51:11.874 --> 01:51:14.667
...and create something new.

01:51:18.547 --> 01:51:20.089
John.

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.843
Don't give in so soon.

01:51:34.897 --> 01:51:38.232
Otherwise, all that
you have achieved...

01:51:38.734 --> 01:51:41.486
...all our work, will be in vain.

01:51:42.571 --> 01:51:46.032
- Of course I will stay and help you...
- As my keeper.

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:50.495
- You don't need a keeper, John.
- No, I don't.

01:52:14.937 --> 01:52:16.396
Never sell.

01:52:16.939 --> 01:52:19.524
Never, ever sell.

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:23.611
Do anything, but keep it whole.

01:52:24.238 --> 01:52:26.030
Understand me?

01:52:26.949 --> 01:52:29.784
Yourself whole.

01:52:39.795 --> 01:52:42.839
Please, Johnny, don't be sad.

01:52:45.676 --> 01:52:48.302
I love you, Johnny.

01:52:49.138 --> 01:52:51.264
I love you.

01:53:40.272 --> 01:53:42.690
Leave us now, Iris, please.

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:46.110
Johnny.

01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:49.632
Oh, Johnny.

01:56:04.249 --> 01:56:05.958
Thank you so much for coming.

01:56:06.168 --> 01:56:10.379
May I take this opportunity
to congratulate you on your engagement.

01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:12.715
- May you both be very happy.
- Thank you.

01:56:12.925 --> 01:56:14.467
Monsieur D'Arnot.

01:56:16.511 --> 01:56:18.971
The erection of a new wing...

01:56:19.181 --> 01:56:21.474
...to Waterhouse's
magnificent building...

01:56:21.683 --> 01:56:25.811
...allows us to house a wider
selection of specimens...

01:56:26.146 --> 01:56:27.688
...many of which were collected...

01:56:27.898 --> 01:56:31.984
...during my recent, ill-fated expedition
to West Africa.

01:56:32.402 --> 01:56:37.073
An enterprise wholly
in the spirit of Charles Darwin...

01:56:37.282 --> 01:56:42.495
...helping us to understand
the origin of our species.

01:56:42.955 --> 01:56:47.500
To complete these works in a style
worthy of this great museum...

01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:52.463
...has been a costly undertaking and one
we could never have contemplated...

01:56:52.673 --> 01:56:57.677
...without the generous patronage
of the late Lord Greystoke.

01:56:57.970 --> 01:57:01.639
It is with great pleasure
that I call upon his grandson...

01:57:01.848 --> 01:57:07.061
...the present earl, to declare
the Greystoke Gallery open.

01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:09.355
Would you care to cut the tape?

01:57:19.449 --> 01:57:22.159
We'll go past to the left
of these central cases.

01:57:25.205 --> 01:57:29.250
You may recognize one of
the specimens from Africa.

01:57:31.253 --> 01:57:35.089
The great hawks.
I was just explaining...

01:57:36.216 --> 01:57:38.426
...the ornithological cage here.

01:57:38.635 --> 01:57:41.137
It's a little macabre.

01:57:41.346 --> 01:57:44.724
It's principally bones and beaks.

01:57:44.933 --> 01:57:47.518
With the magnifying glass,
you can actually see...

01:57:47.728 --> 01:57:50.062
...the projection on the end
of the bird's beak...

01:57:50.272 --> 01:57:52.148
...with which he breaks out of the egg.

01:57:52.357 --> 01:57:55.735
The odd thing is the various...

01:58:45.368 --> 01:58:47.328
Our piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance.

01:58:47.537 --> 01:58:50.748
This is actually the largest
single collection of...

01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:54.460
Miss Porter, this is one of
the largest single collections...

01:58:54.669 --> 01:58:57.088
...of hummingbirds in Europe.

02:01:51.471 --> 02:01:54.265
Look at the one with
the blue breast on the branch...

02:01:54.474 --> 02:01:55.933
- Excuse me.
- Mm?

02:01:56.142 --> 02:01:58.978
Sir Evelyn, it's Lord Greystoke.

02:01:59.521 --> 02:02:00.771
Excuse me.

02:02:00.981 --> 02:02:03.983
Jackson. Harrison.
Excuse me. Gangway!

02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:29.967
- Harrison.
- Yes, sir.

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:32.845
The barracks. Troops.

02:03:38.703 --> 02:03:40.371
John, don't do this, please.

02:03:59.933 --> 02:04:01.433
Guardsman.

02:04:17.492 --> 02:04:19.410
- Get back, everybody.
- Get back.

02:04:19.828 --> 02:04:21.453
Back, please.

02:04:42.809 --> 02:04:45.811
No. No.

02:04:47.021 --> 02:04:48.313
No.

02:04:48.523 --> 02:04:51.233
No, no. No, no.

02:04:51.693 --> 02:04:53.152
No.

02:05:13.673 --> 02:05:14.882
C'Ã©tait mon pÃ¨re!

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:25.309
He was my father!

02:05:40.366 --> 02:05:42.409
However well
he may have mastered...

02:05:42.619 --> 02:05:47.706
...the intricacies and complexities
of this absurd society...

02:05:48.666 --> 02:05:51.502
...he is what the jungle
has made him.

02:05:51.711 --> 02:05:55.297
That we saw yesterday. Irrefutably.

02:05:55.507 --> 02:05:57.424
I take a different view.

02:05:57.634 --> 02:06:00.052
He cannot blame society...

02:06:00.261 --> 02:06:03.514
...for the action of an impulsive
and undisciplined keeper.

02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:07.559
There are two reasons he should stay.
Firstly, for the sake of science.

02:06:07.769 --> 02:06:09.311
Science?

02:06:09.938 --> 02:06:12.147
Whose science?

02:06:12.482 --> 02:06:15.901
Your science? The imperial science?

02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:20.072
And second, because to go
would be a failure.

02:06:20.448 --> 02:06:22.741
You are so utterly predictable.

02:06:23.243 --> 02:06:26.495
What in his terms is
a magnificent achievement...

02:06:26.704 --> 02:06:29.081
...you see as your failure,
so you call it his.

02:06:29.499 --> 02:06:31.542
How typical.

02:06:32.961 --> 02:06:34.795
How tragic.

02:06:36.714 --> 02:06:38.757
How very English.

02:06:39.467 --> 02:06:42.970
He is the earl of Greystoke,
Monsieur D'Arnot.

02:06:43.179 --> 02:06:48.559
The earl has great estates,
great wealth, great power.

02:06:48.768 --> 02:06:53.313
Oh, of course, I understand that to you
such considerations may seem absurd...

02:06:53.523 --> 02:06:57.776
...but it is essential for all of us
that he take his place in society...

02:06:58.152 --> 02:07:00.821
...as his family has done
for generations.

02:07:01.322 --> 02:07:04.908
He must be greater than
the accident of his childhood.

02:07:05.118 --> 02:07:09.246
And, what is more important,
he must be seen to be so.

02:07:11.291 --> 02:07:13.000
My God.

02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:19.548
Yes, of course he could stay here.

02:07:21.092 --> 02:07:25.429
But through people like you he would
become an object of derision...

02:07:25.638 --> 02:07:28.974
...speculation, experimentation.

02:07:29.183 --> 02:07:32.936
I promise you, Sir Evelyn Blount,
that I will do all in my power...

02:07:33.146 --> 02:07:35.647
...to protect him from this abuse.

02:07:36.065 --> 02:07:37.941
This insult.

02:07:51.789 --> 02:07:53.790
Father!

02:07:54.334 --> 02:07:55.667
Mother!

02:07:56.252 --> 02:08:00.005
Family, family, family!

02:08:00.214 --> 02:08:02.174
Mother, father!

02:08:02.383 --> 02:08:04.468
Family!

02:08:09.057 --> 02:08:10.474
Father!

02:08:10.683 --> 02:08:12.392
Mother!

02:08:14.312 --> 02:08:18.106
Family!

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.693
Animal!

02:08:29.243 --> 02:08:32.371
Mother, father.

02:08:35.249 --> 02:08:37.542
He must be allowed
to decide for himself.

02:08:37.752 --> 02:08:40.504
I want him to stay,
but I also want him to be happy.

02:08:40.713 --> 02:08:42.381
As happy as he can be.

02:08:42.590 --> 02:08:45.592
And we want for him only
what he wants for himself.

02:08:45.802 --> 02:08:46.802
To be whole, to be...

02:09:15.248 --> 02:09:16.540
I am going home.

02:09:16.749 --> 02:09:19.751
Lord Greystoke, I realize...

02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:32.264
That what happened
in London yesterday...

02:09:32.473 --> 02:09:35.267
...must have been
deeply distressing to you.

02:09:35.476 --> 02:09:38.311
But I would advise you,
in your present state...

02:09:38.521 --> 02:09:42.816
...not to make any decision
that could affect your...

02:09:43.651 --> 02:09:44.985
...future.

02:09:49.073 --> 02:09:50.866
I am going home.

02:09:52.368 --> 02:09:55.662
- Lord Greystoke.
- I should go...

02:09:55.872 --> 02:09:57.748
...because I know now
who I am not.

02:09:58.249 --> 02:10:00.792
You are the earl of Greystoke!

02:10:19.103 --> 02:10:22.022
Half of me is the earl of Greystoke.

02:10:30.323 --> 02:10:32.657
The other half is wild.
