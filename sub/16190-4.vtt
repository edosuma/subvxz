00:16.059 --> 00:17.125
What...

00:17.194 --> 00:18.426
Hello.

00:18.495 --> 00:21.029
Can... Can I have those?

00:21.098 --> 00:23.765
Uh... oh.

00:25.695 --> 00:27.068
Of course.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.173
Yeah.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.408
Wow.

00:33.477 --> 00:36.177
Your car is messy.

00:36.246 --> 00:38.313
You got kids. I can tell that.

00:38.381 --> 00:40.215
Yeah, I sure do.

00:40.283 --> 00:41.797
Why are you sleeping in your car?

00:41.798 --> 00:43.012
Oh.

00:43.081 --> 00:46.149
Uh, I'm tired all the time.

00:46.218 --> 00:47.951
I call it Momstein Bar.

00:48.019 --> 00:50.373
I try to power nap when I can.

00:50.491 --> 00:52.889
Yeah, you got to take them
here and there, right, Mama?

00:52.958 --> 00:54.312
Yeah.

00:54.492 --> 00:55.826
Oh, I have to go to Staples, remember?

00:55.827 --> 00:57.926
You promised. I have to get
five things off my list.

00:58.073 --> 01:00.033
Wait, Mom. Mom, you're
passing the Goodwill place.

01:00.075 --> 01:01.808
- Mom, pay attention!
- Stop!

01:01.877 --> 01:04.744
Here. Take the jacket.

01:04.813 --> 01:05.812
Ohh.

01:05.881 --> 01:07.567
And what size shoe do you wear?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.280
Thank you. I wear a 8.

01:09.349 --> 01:11.182
Because I...

01:11.250 --> 01:13.184
I don't know whose this is,

01:13.252 --> 01:15.286
but these are, like, a 9 or a 10, maybe.

01:15.355 --> 01:19.824
Oh, man, you are such a nice lady.

01:19.892 --> 01:21.158
You're pretty.

01:21.227 --> 01:23.294
Thank you. You're pretty.

01:23.363 --> 01:26.330
Oh, no. No. I used to be,

01:26.399 --> 01:29.100
but you got to take care of yourself...

01:29.168 --> 01:31.102
You know, get your car washed,

01:31.170 --> 01:32.470
get your hair done.

01:32.538 --> 01:35.940
How do you think you're
going to get a nice man

01:36.009 --> 01:37.174
to make love to you?

01:37.243 --> 01:41.145
Oh. No. None of that for
me. I got rid of him.

01:41.214 --> 01:43.047
I'm not talking about a husband.

01:43.116 --> 01:45.149
I'm talking about a man.

01:45.218 --> 01:48.786
Don't you want a man to be nice to you?

01:48.855 --> 01:49.987
Oh.

01:50.056 --> 01:51.455
Yeah. Well...

01:51.524 --> 01:54.225
I told Paisley we could
to a vintage photo shoot,

01:54.293 --> 01:55.459
and I need wardrobe.

01:55.684 --> 01:58.805
♪ Shut up, Maxie, shut up, Maxie ♪

01:58.806 --> 02:00.064
Shut your face!

02:00.133 --> 02:02.500
Sam, your daughter is a monster.

02:02.568 --> 02:05.102
You can't just be a mama all the time.

02:05.171 --> 02:07.405
You got to sometimes be a lady,

02:07.473 --> 02:10.007
with the man putting
his full weight on you,

02:10.076 --> 02:11.809
making you feel good.

02:11.878 --> 02:13.310
Yeah.

02:13.379 --> 02:14.645
I appreciate that, Diane,

02:14.714 --> 02:17.248
but there is zero time
in the mom's schedule

02:17.316 --> 02:18.482
for being a lady.

02:18.551 --> 02:21.285
Oh, yeah, okay. I hear you with that.

02:21.354 --> 02:23.254
I raised four of my own.

02:23.322 --> 02:24.655
So you know.

02:24.724 --> 02:29.360
Oh, yeah. I mean, you give
them every second you got.

02:29.429 --> 02:31.328
You take them to school.

02:31.397 --> 02:33.130
You take them to their friend's house,

02:33.199 --> 02:34.265
music lessons...

02:34.333 --> 02:36.033
- Dance class.
- Yeah, sports.

02:36.102 --> 02:37.935
All those activities.

02:38.004 --> 02:39.170
Endless.

02:39.238 --> 02:40.337
I got my oldest.

02:40.406 --> 02:42.373
He's a lawyer back in Minnesota.

02:42.442 --> 02:44.208
- Wow.
- Yeah.

02:44.277 --> 02:45.676
One of them's married in Oregon.

02:45.745 --> 02:47.978
Two of them are working back east.

02:48.047 --> 02:49.080
They got good lives.

02:49.148 --> 02:51.282
And you gave that to them.

02:51.350 --> 02:53.317
Just like you.

02:53.386 --> 02:55.352
And now look at me.

02:55.421 --> 02:58.389
They leave you with nothing.

02:58.458 --> 03:02.159
You got to make time for you, Mama.

03:02.228 --> 03:03.461
They take everything,

03:03.529 --> 03:05.429
and then you're like me,

03:05.498 --> 03:08.065
hoping you find some nice lady

03:08.134 --> 03:09.834
to give you a jacket.

03:13.439 --> 03:14.972
Get out.

03:15.041 --> 03:15.873
What?

03:15.942 --> 03:17.208
What are you doing, Samantha?

03:17.276 --> 03:19.610
- Get out.
- No way, Mom.

03:19.679 --> 03:22.113
Mom, you can't just leave us here.

03:22.181 --> 03:24.215
There's a bus stop right there.

03:24.283 --> 03:26.350
Get on the bus. Take it home.

03:26.419 --> 03:27.685
Mom, don't be a drama queen.

03:27.754 --> 03:30.254
That bus doesn't even go to our house.

03:30.323 --> 03:31.422
No, it doesn't.

03:31.491 --> 03:33.424
You're going to take the bus to Ventura,

03:33.493 --> 03:35.559
get out, walk up the hill.

03:35.628 --> 03:38.496
Bye! Bye! Get out! I mean it!

03:38.564 --> 03:40.564
Mom, we're sorry.
We don't need anything.

03:40.633 --> 03:43.100
We'll help you with the groceries
when we get home.

03:43.169 --> 03:44.135
Please.

04:15.334 --> 04:16.801
Shit, I don't know.

04:17.503 --> 04:18.601
Damn it.

04:18.671 --> 04:21.505
What did the Network
say about Eliza again?

04:21.574 --> 04:24.308
I don't know. She
doesn't pop. Something like that.

04:24.377 --> 04:27.044
Uhh. I'm sick of all these ladies.

04:28.414 --> 04:30.214
Jen, what did they say about Eliza?

04:30.283 --> 04:32.449
Um, the note was she's a bummer.

04:32.518 --> 04:33.717
She is a bummer.

04:33.786 --> 04:35.920
I hate that we circle back
to talking about her.

04:35.988 --> 04:39.223
The network already approved
Manning Truesome. Let's just cast her.

04:39.292 --> 04:41.225
I'll kill myself first.

04:41.294 --> 04:42.526
- George.
- Yeah.

04:42.595 --> 04:44.495
Is there anyone we haven't thought of?

04:44.564 --> 04:47.231
All right, look. I have someone.

04:47.300 --> 04:47.950
Who?

04:48.102 --> 04:49.627
She was in a pilot I directed

04:49.669 --> 04:51.569
about ten years ago. She was hilarious.

04:51.637 --> 04:54.205
Network fired her
because she had no tits.

04:54.273 --> 04:55.406
That's not good.

04:55.474 --> 04:57.474
Who?

04:57.543 --> 05:00.211
- Sam Fox.
- I used to jerk off to her.

05:02.114 --> 05:03.347
No way.

05:03.416 --> 05:06.383
No way. She's, like, 60 now.

05:06.452 --> 05:08.552
Possible side effects include nausea,

05:08.621 --> 05:11.522
stiffness of joints,
thoughts of suicide,

05:11.591 --> 05:15.759
diarrhea, and, in rare cases,
seizures or death.

05:15.828 --> 05:19.296
Yeah, Sam, can you sound a little more

05:19.365 --> 05:20.764
cheerful during the disclaimer?

05:20.833 --> 05:23.434
Possible side effects include nausea,

05:23.502 --> 05:25.903
stiffness of joints,
thoughts of suicide,

05:25.972 --> 05:31.308
diarrhea, and, in rare cases,
seizures or death.

05:31.377 --> 05:33.043
I'm sorry.

05:34.881 --> 05:39.350
I'm sorry. I'm trying to sound
cheerful about diarrhea.

05:39.418 --> 05:42.219
I'm sorry. Ahem. Diarrhea, sir.

05:42.288 --> 05:43.754
Oh, diarrhea, everyone.

05:43.823 --> 05:47.725
Is it thoughts of suicide and diarrhea,

05:47.793 --> 05:50.461
or is it thoughts of suicide

05:50.529 --> 05:53.530
and also thoughts of diarrhea?

05:53.599 --> 05:56.200
There's...

05:56.269 --> 05:58.302
I know, buddy. I'm sorry.

05:58.371 --> 06:00.504
What does this drug do anyway?

06:00.573 --> 06:01.739
It's a boner maker.

06:01.807 --> 06:06.243
Oh. Well, anything for a boner.

06:06.312 --> 06:07.278
Yeah, okay.

06:07.346 --> 06:08.812
I mean, although,

06:08.881 --> 06:10.748
if a guy has a nice hard dick

06:10.816 --> 06:12.783
and he has diarrhea
squirting out the back,

06:12.852 --> 06:16.120
it sort of ruins it,
you know what I mean?

06:16.188 --> 06:17.187
Just sort of.

06:35.775 --> 06:38.976
Okay, let's go. Is it you?

06:46.185 --> 06:47.952
Shit.

06:53.292 --> 06:54.458
Oh.

06:54.527 --> 06:56.126
Come on.

06:59.532 --> 07:01.231
Bingo.

07:05.604 --> 07:07.304
Seriously?

07:07.373 --> 07:08.405
Ohh.

07:21.020 --> 07:23.620
Ohh! No, no, no, no, no,

07:23.689 --> 07:25.556
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

07:26.726 --> 07:28.359
Mama, what's happening?

07:28.427 --> 07:29.460
Honey, I'm sorry.

07:29.528 --> 07:30.627
Mom, what did you do?

07:30.696 --> 07:32.563
It's just the smoke detectors.

07:32.631 --> 07:33.909
- Oh, my God.
- Mama, I'm scared!

07:33.933 --> 07:36.400
- It's okay.
- Mom, call Dad right now!

07:36.469 --> 07:37.801
- No!
- What's going on?

07:37.870 --> 07:39.737
Who are all those people in there?

07:39.805 --> 07:41.705
Who cares? Are we going
to die right now?

07:41.774 --> 07:44.341
You idiot! It's just a
frigging smoke detector!

07:44.410 --> 07:45.476
Shut up!

07:45.544 --> 07:47.678
Everybody, stop!

07:47.747 --> 07:49.680
I am so, so, so sorry.

07:49.749 --> 07:51.749
My God, this is so embarrassing.

07:51.817 --> 07:54.018
Shut up, Max! Mommy's doing her best!

07:54.086 --> 07:57.654
Mom, call Dad. The firemen
are going to want to talk to Dad.

07:57.723 --> 07:59.757
I can talk to the firemen!

07:59.825 --> 08:01.892
I don't need your fucking father!

08:01.961 --> 08:06.463
I can talk to a fireman by myself!

08:08.875 --> 08:10.806
I mean, I can send you out
for any audition that you want,

08:10.806 --> 08:13.161
but you have to be careful
about burning yourself out.

08:13.229 --> 08:14.629
I think personally that it's better

08:14.698 --> 08:17.465
to go out for just a few
things every month.

08:17.534 --> 08:19.267
You know, just seem more selective.

08:19.335 --> 08:21.502
The interesting thing about you

08:21.571 --> 08:24.172
is that you can play
a good range age-wise.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.441
Oh, definitely. I can play up to 25

08:26.509 --> 08:28.976
- and really down to 16.
- Mm-hmm.

08:29.045 --> 08:30.244
Phone call.

08:30.313 --> 08:32.080
- I'm meeting.
- It's Jen Abrams.

08:34.317 --> 08:35.650
Jen, hi.

08:35.719 --> 08:38.086
Hey, Tressa, do you still
represent Sam Fox?

08:38.154 --> 08:40.288
Uh... yeah.

08:40.356 --> 08:41.655
So you don't. Did she fire you?

08:41.725 --> 08:45.126
Well, no, Jen, she didn't.
I do represent her.

08:45.195 --> 08:46.260
Can I help you?

08:46.329 --> 08:49.130
I'm checking her avails for a pilot.

08:49.199 --> 08:50.364
<i>Oh, for when?</i>

08:50.433 --> 08:53.267
It shoots in March. It's the lead.

08:53.336 --> 08:56.003
The lead? Whose pilot is it?

08:56.072 --> 08:57.238
Danny and Zack.

08:57.307 --> 09:00.208
Okay. Well, I will give her a call.

09:00.276 --> 09:01.375
Um, is this...

09:01.444 --> 09:02.443
Danny and Zack love her.

09:02.512 --> 09:04.078
Haven't checked the network yet.

09:04.147 --> 09:06.114
Ah. Got it. Thanks, Jen.

09:06.182 --> 09:07.081
Yeah.

09:08.284 --> 09:10.084
See, I like that one.

09:10.153 --> 09:11.452
Yeah, but...

09:11.521 --> 09:13.054
It... It's subtle.

09:13.123 --> 09:14.222
Like, you don't notice,

09:14.290 --> 09:15.423
but you can totally tell.

09:15.492 --> 09:17.091
- It's shiny.
- It's really good.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.327
I want my face and neck

09:19.395 --> 09:21.395
to stop being old-looking, that's all.

09:21.464 --> 09:23.397
Yeah. That's scary. That's just scary.

09:23.466 --> 09:25.333
She looks like an alien.

09:25.401 --> 09:27.135
Hang on. It's my manager.

09:27.203 --> 09:28.169
Hi, honey.

09:28.238 --> 09:29.437
Hi, Tressa.

09:29.506 --> 09:33.441
Hey, so, uh, some people
are checking your avails

09:33.510 --> 09:35.343
for March for a pilot.

09:35.411 --> 09:36.444
Okay.

09:36.513 --> 09:38.479
Should I say you're around?

09:38.548 --> 09:41.282
Yeah, I'm around. I mean,
you know I'm around.

09:41.351 --> 09:43.351
- Sure.
- Wait. What's the pilot?

09:43.419 --> 09:44.585
- What's the part?
- You know,

09:44.654 --> 09:46.654
just the usual friend
of the lead kind of thing.

09:46.723 --> 09:48.756
Anyway, I will let them
know that you're around.

09:48.825 --> 09:51.392
- Yeah. Bye, doll.
- Bye, honey.

09:51.461 --> 09:53.694
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

09:53.763 --> 09:55.429
So nice to meet you. I'm John.

09:55.498 --> 09:57.231
Hi. I'm Sam.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.633
This is Sunny, my friend.

09:58.701 --> 10:01.402
Uh, did you get a chance
to look at the photos?

10:01.471 --> 10:03.604
Ahem. Yeah, we did.

10:03.673 --> 10:07.408
Um, I'm not saying that yours do at all,

10:07.477 --> 10:09.610
but I notice that sometimes

10:09.679 --> 10:12.280
people tend to look a little shiny

10:12.348 --> 10:14.382
and a bit like a potato, kind of.

10:14.450 --> 10:16.217
A wet potato.

10:16.286 --> 10:17.451
Right. Well, not here

10:17.520 --> 10:19.443
because our technique is undetectable.

10:19.584 --> 10:23.257
You will not leave looking
like a shiny potato face.

10:23.326 --> 10:25.493
Wow. Okay. Well, we're here.

10:25.562 --> 10:28.396
I mean, this is for me. She's perfect.

10:28.464 --> 10:31.365
Ha ha ha. No, seriously,
what do you... what do you...

10:31.434 --> 10:33.334
How young are we now?

10:33.403 --> 10:35.503
Um, I'm 38.

10:35.572 --> 10:37.138
- You look great.
- Thank you.

10:37.207 --> 10:38.272
You both look great.

10:38.341 --> 10:40.030
I wouldn't really do anything on you.

10:40.031 --> 10:41.275
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

10:42.412 --> 10:43.578
Wow.

10:43.646 --> 10:47.281
Okay. Why don't you
climb up onto this chair?

10:47.350 --> 10:49.250
Okay. Ahem.

10:52.155 --> 10:53.020
Okay.

10:54.357 --> 10:55.356
Awesome.

10:55.425 --> 10:56.657
Okay, let's have a look.

10:56.726 --> 10:58.693
- Okay, so, ahem...
- Uh-huh.

10:58.761 --> 11:02.697
You see how kind of the left
side of my face, it's melting?

11:02.765 --> 11:04.532
- Hmm.
- Like, my right eye,

11:04.601 --> 11:05.733
it's really heavy,

11:05.802 --> 11:07.635
like I've been in a prize fight.

11:07.704 --> 11:09.570
- Hmm.
- And then my neck.

11:09.639 --> 11:12.473
Jesus. I mean, what's happening to me?

11:12.542 --> 11:14.508
- Mm-hmm.
- Show him the picture.

11:14.577 --> 11:17.111
- Oh, yeah. Um...
- The picture of me.

11:18.781 --> 11:20.448
See, that's like, um...

11:20.516 --> 11:21.549
- Ah.
- Seven, eight,

11:21.618 --> 11:22.617
- maybe...
- 14.

11:22.685 --> 11:23.662
- ...years.
- Yeah, right.

11:23.686 --> 11:26.554
See, here you look fresh.

11:26.623 --> 11:29.590
And now you look tired, just tired.

11:29.659 --> 11:31.559
- Oh.
- That's all. No big deal.

11:31.628 --> 11:33.394
- We can remedy that.
- Okay.

11:33.463 --> 11:35.329
Okay? Here, why don't you hold this?

11:35.398 --> 11:36.397
- Okay.
- Okay. Now, see,

11:36.466 --> 11:37.732
if we do a partial face lift,

11:37.800 --> 11:39.634
it would raise all of this up.

11:39.702 --> 11:41.435
- Okay.
- If we did the neck lift,

11:41.504 --> 11:43.304
it would be very understated

11:43.373 --> 11:44.538
- Okay, watch.
- Okay.

11:44.607 --> 11:46.374
Watch this. See this?

11:46.442 --> 11:48.542
- Pretty.
- Oh.

11:48.611 --> 11:50.278
- Pretty.
- Mm.

11:50.346 --> 11:52.647
Huh? Pretty.

11:52.715 --> 11:54.045
- Pretty.
- He's right.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.594
- It's kind of amazing.
- Huh?

11:55.618 --> 11:56.550
- Uh-huh.
- Pretty.

11:56.619 --> 11:57.585
Pretty.

11:57.654 --> 11:58.653
What about, uh,

11:58.721 --> 12:00.321
what about my neck thing?

12:00.390 --> 12:01.589
Okay. Watch. Ready?

12:01.658 --> 12:03.391
- Mm-hmm. 
- Mm-hmm.

12:03.459 --> 12:04.458
Fresh.

12:04.527 --> 12:05.626
Whoa.

12:05.695 --> 12:07.328
- Fresh.
- Fresh.

12:07.397 --> 12:09.530
Huh? Fresh.

12:09.599 --> 12:11.599
Huh? So fresh.

12:11.668 --> 12:13.734
You see that? Fresh.

12:13.803 --> 12:15.803
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

12:15.872 --> 12:18.272
You look like you went to, like,

12:18.341 --> 12:19.373
the Bahamas or something.

12:19.442 --> 12:20.574
Yeah. Wow.

12:20.643 --> 12:23.844
Uh, how long is the down time?

12:23.913 --> 12:25.613
Well, your face will be all bruises

12:25.682 --> 12:27.615
- for about three weeks.
- Oh, shit.

12:27.684 --> 12:30.351
Oh, but I anticipate
a very youthful result.

12:31.688 --> 12:33.821
W-What would you tell the girls?

12:33.890 --> 12:35.890
Well, I'll just
tell them I got attacked.

12:35.959 --> 12:37.792
That way, they won't be mad at me.

12:37.860 --> 12:41.128
At least they'll be nice
to be for a day, maybe.

12:41.931 --> 12:44.432
So I have an opening on the 18th.

12:44.500 --> 12:49.270
Wow. Well, how much are we talking here?

12:49.339 --> 12:50.604
Okay.

12:50.673 --> 12:54.442
For the neck lift, it would be 45,000.

12:54.510 --> 12:55.743
And for the partial face lift,

12:55.812 --> 12:57.812
it would run 50,000.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.780
Oh, you know what? I'm just going...

12:59.849 --> 13:02.650
Can I take the price list with me today?

13:02.719 --> 13:05.553
Because I'm going to think about it.

13:05.621 --> 13:09.223
I don't think I can go
completely Garbo right now.

13:09.292 --> 13:10.091
Of course.

13:10.159 --> 13:11.759
Sit, sit, sit. Everyone sit.

13:11.828 --> 13:17.331
Terrific. So we are very excited

13:17.400 --> 13:18.399
about your show.

13:18.468 --> 13:19.633
So are we.

13:20.737 --> 13:24.338
Good. So what's up?

13:24.407 --> 13:25.706
What can I help you with now?

13:25.775 --> 13:28.576
So, uh, we know who
we want for the lead.

13:28.644 --> 13:33.414
Wow. Great. Have we seen her?

13:33.483 --> 13:34.515
All, right, so, Charles,

13:34.584 --> 13:35.794
I know you want to see choices.

13:35.818 --> 13:37.685
I mean, we've all been
through this before.

13:37.754 --> 13:40.488
And I'd like to think we
have some credibility here

13:40.556 --> 13:42.690
with our other shows doing so well.

13:42.759 --> 13:44.992
We absolutely love your shows.
I hope you know that.

13:45.061 --> 13:48.362
So who... who is it?
Who are we talking about?

13:48.431 --> 13:49.597
Jen: Sam Fox.

13:49.665 --> 13:51.499
Sam Fox is funny,

13:51.567 --> 13:52.867
and that's our bottom line.

13:52.935 --> 13:54.802
You've got cute all over the network,

13:54.871 --> 13:56.504
and there's cute in the show,

13:56.572 --> 13:58.506
but Sam Fox is, like, real people.

13:58.574 --> 14:01.709
She will score with every demographic.

14:01.778 --> 14:04.712
When we cast young, we
leave everyone else out.

14:04.781 --> 14:06.747
Sam Fox has sex appeal,

14:06.816 --> 14:09.517
but the big move here is that
she's hysterically funny

14:09.585 --> 14:11.318
and everyone likes her.

14:11.387 --> 14:13.054
She's an everywoman.

14:13.689 --> 14:15.322
Works for me.

14:15.391 --> 14:16.490
Jen, great job.

14:16.559 --> 14:17.691
She's not on the show yet.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.926
What are you mad about?

14:18.995 --> 14:20.873
Because I just burned
about 30% of my credibility

14:20.897 --> 14:22.596
with Charles Kemp.

14:22.665 --> 14:24.043
What, you didn't believe
what you said in there?

14:24.067 --> 14:26.634
- Because you seemed to.
- That's my job.

14:26.702 --> 14:27.968
You're a gender traitor.

14:28.037 --> 14:30.571
You're putting down your own people.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.739
My people?

14:31.808 --> 14:34.375
You know, start a test
deal with Sam Fox.

14:34.444 --> 14:37.078
Call the reps now, please.

14:38.648 --> 14:41.649
Uh, Charles said that?

14:41.717 --> 14:44.218
That's what he said. So
we need to start a test deal.

14:44.287 --> 14:45.319
Wow.

14:45.388 --> 14:47.788
Yeah, well, send a deal
memo to my office,

14:47.857 --> 14:49.723
and we'll get started.

14:49.792 --> 14:51.725
Okay, Tressa. Thanks.

14:51.794 --> 14:52.960
Bye, Jen.

14:53.029 --> 14:55.729
Should I get Sam on the phone?

14:55.798 --> 14:59.600
No. And don't tell anyone about this.

14:59.669 --> 15:01.368
You got that?

15:01.437 --> 15:03.170
Okay.

15:07.012 --> 15:08.144
We create...

15:08.213 --> 15:09.379
- Just let me...
- Stop.

15:09.448 --> 15:11.214
- I just...
- Mom, shush. Pay attention.

15:11.283 --> 15:12.540
I want to get your face in.

15:12.543 --> 15:13.650
Fine! Jesus!

15:13.719 --> 15:15.151
We're not misandrists,

15:15.220 --> 15:18.221
but the patriarchy must be stopped.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.389
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

15:19.458 --> 15:21.424
- Now, Martin Luther King...
- Yeah!

15:21.493 --> 15:23.126
...he had one kind of a dream.

15:23.195 --> 15:24.360
And if he was alive...

15:24.429 --> 15:26.062
Martin Luther King beat his wife.

15:26.131 --> 15:27.263
What?

15:27.332 --> 15:28.465
Well, some people say

15:28.533 --> 15:30.066
that the FBI spread that story

15:30.135 --> 15:31.108
to discredit him,

15:31.109 --> 15:32.547
but other people say
he cheated on his wife,

15:32.571 --> 15:35.238
- and also...
- Wait. Who told you this?

15:35.307 --> 15:36.940
Cary, Mom.

15:38.143 --> 15:39.109
My teacher?

15:39.177 --> 15:40.143
- Yes.
- Remember?

15:40.212 --> 15:41.177
Yes.

15:41.246 --> 15:43.213
Mahatma Gandhi beat his wife, too.

15:43.281 --> 15:45.648
Aah. I didn't know
Gandhi was even married.

15:45.717 --> 15:48.251
Why would Cary be
telling you these things?

15:48.320 --> 15:50.386
Like, is he trying to make
you hate these people?

15:50.455 --> 15:53.189
No. He's just telling us
the whole truth about them,

15:53.258 --> 15:55.125
or at least as it's known.

15:55.193 --> 15:57.227
He's telling us what's been said.

15:57.295 --> 16:00.330
I mean, yeah, maybe
the FBI lied about King,

16:00.398 --> 16:04.000
but to say that he's this
perfect human statue

16:04.069 --> 16:06.002
is... is a lie.

16:06.071 --> 16:07.370
Hmm.

16:07.439 --> 16:09.272
It... It's important, Mom.

16:09.341 --> 16:10.540
Plus, they're still my heroes

16:10.609 --> 16:12.642
for the good that they did do.

16:12.711 --> 16:15.378
But their personal lives
were just kind of sketched out.

16:15.447 --> 16:18.281
Anyway, woman is
the nigger of the world.

16:18.350 --> 16:19.482
Frankie, don't say that.

16:19.551 --> 16:21.317
John Lennon said that.

16:21.386 --> 16:22.685
I know, but don't you say it.

16:22.754 --> 16:24.554
Do you know what he's
saying with that song?

16:24.623 --> 16:26.389
Also, it's a direct quote from

16:26.458 --> 16:28.024
Both: Zora Neale Hurston.

16:28.093 --> 16:29.325
Mom, I know.

16:29.394 --> 16:30.493
He wasn't being derogatory.

16:30.562 --> 16:34.063
It was being, like, metaphorical.

16:34.132 --> 16:35.865
Cary told us that.

16:35.934 --> 16:37.033
Hmm.

16:37.102 --> 16:38.968
Also, Gandhi was pen pals with Hitler.

16:39.037 --> 16:40.303
Oh, my God.

16:40.372 --> 16:42.438
This kid looks like
Sam could be his mom.

16:42.507 --> 16:44.207
Why if we give her a black son?

16:44.276 --> 16:45.275
Like she adopted?

16:45.343 --> 16:46.442
Or shtupped a black guy?

16:46.511 --> 16:48.511
Shtupped. Yes. Please.

16:50.515 --> 16:52.482
We're ready for him.

16:52.551 --> 16:54.250
I have Charles for you.

16:54.319 --> 16:55.351
Hi, Charles.

16:55.420 --> 16:57.420
- Hi, Charles.
- Hey, Charles.

16:57.489 --> 16:59.255
Guys, I have great news.

16:59.324 --> 17:01.424
- Yeah?
- Great. Let's hear it.

17:01.493 --> 17:03.093
Rachel McAdams got
a hold of your script.

17:03.161 --> 17:04.227
She wants the lead.

17:04.296 --> 17:05.261
She's amazing.

17:05.329 --> 17:06.329
She's funny, talented.

17:06.397 --> 17:07.430
We love her.

17:07.499 --> 17:09.065
So we just locked her down,

17:09.134 --> 17:10.567
and based on that,

17:10.635 --> 17:12.101
we're ready to move on to series.

17:14.940 --> 17:17.240
Uh, Charles, that... that's great.

17:17.309 --> 17:18.575
Amazing. We love her.

17:18.643 --> 17:20.376
Congratulations, guys.

17:20.444 --> 17:21.944
I'm excited.

17:22.012 --> 17:23.179
So are we.

17:23.248 --> 17:24.414
Good. We'll talk soon.

17:24.482 --> 17:25.682
Ow. Yeah, right.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.585
Uh, all right, great. So let's, uh...

17:28.653 --> 17:30.987
let's look at this stuff
and figure it out.

17:40.918 --> 17:44.378
We're gathered here
today because we know

17:44.379 --> 17:46.376
- that there is an atrocity...
- You know, I read

17:46.445 --> 17:49.947
that Mother Teresa
used to take private jets

17:50.015 --> 17:51.815
and go to fancy dinners.

17:51.884 --> 17:54.017
Mom, that's not the same thing.

17:54.086 --> 17:55.319
She was a Catholic nun.

17:55.387 --> 17:57.688
There's nothing complex
about Mother Teresa.

17:57.756 --> 17:58.622
She sucked.

17:58.691 --> 18:00.824
I know, but Gandhi was so little.

18:00.893 --> 18:02.659
How could he beat up anybody?

18:04.136 --> 18:06.475
All right, guys, let's start the mob.

18:06.499 --> 18:09.533
Just look to the lady in
the pink T-shirt for the moves.

18:09.602 --> 18:12.202
Frankie, take the rest of these
T-shirts. Hand them out.

18:12.271 --> 18:14.004
Yes, I can do it, yes.

18:15.140 --> 18:16.940
She loves your class.

18:17.009 --> 18:19.776
Well, Frankie is a rock star.

18:19.845 --> 18:21.211
Yeah. Uh, listen,

18:21.280 --> 18:24.014
I got to ask a favor of you, buddy.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.884
Frankie's knowledge of
the world is accelerating

18:26.952 --> 18:29.019
because of your class, good and bad,

18:29.088 --> 18:32.089
and that's great, but
it's going really fast.

18:32.157 --> 18:34.925
And I can't keep up.

18:34.994 --> 18:37.261
I work. I rarely
get a download from her,

18:37.329 --> 18:40.731
and when I do, she's on
a newer and bigger planet,

18:40.799 --> 18:41.798
like today.

18:41.867 --> 18:43.267
Come with us to Stockton.

18:43.335 --> 18:46.203
- What? - Yeah, we're going on
a class trip to Stockton.

18:46.272 --> 18:48.939
You would learn so much with Frankie,

18:49.008 --> 18:50.252
so then you'll be totally up to speed.

18:50.276 --> 18:52.109
- Our song is next.
- When is it?

18:52.177 --> 18:53.255
It's the first week of March.

18:53.279 --> 18:55.245
She should totally come with us.

18:55.314 --> 18:57.180
Oh, Stockton? Mom's always got to work.

18:57.249 --> 18:58.348
She won't make it, Cary.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.784
Well, that's good, Frankie.

19:00.853 --> 19:01.785
Your mom's an earner.

19:01.854 --> 19:02.853
I know.

19:04.156 --> 19:06.123
Shall we mob it up, Madame?

19:06.191 --> 19:07.858
Yes.

19:13.832 --> 19:15.065
Hi, Sam.

19:15.134 --> 19:20.270
Tressa, hi. Listen, is that
pilot still happening,

19:20.339 --> 19:22.039
that pilot in March?

19:22.107 --> 19:24.141
No, it went away.

19:24.209 --> 19:26.043
Oh, good!

19:26.111 --> 19:28.178
Thanks, honey! Love you!

19:28.247 --> 19:30.847
Love you. Have fun.

19:37.089 --> 19:38.255
I'm going to do it.

19:38.324 --> 19:40.958
Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
