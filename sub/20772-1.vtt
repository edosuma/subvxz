WEBVTT

00:01.171 --> 00:02.851
Previously on "Casual"...

00:02.960 --> 00:04.960
Well, it, uh,
looks like you're being asked

00:04.985 --> 00:06.833
to sell a stake in Snooger

00:06.834 --> 00:09.294
to JME Capital.

00:09.295 --> 00:11.004
Jordan Anderson. Thanks for coming in.

00:11.005 --> 00:14.049
So you, took home the boss' wife.

00:14.050 --> 00:16.050
You can hang around,
watch me fire your employees.

00:16.052 --> 00:18.178
Or you can sign.
They all get to keep their jobs,

00:18.179 --> 00:20.013
and Snooger becomes a line item

00:20.014 --> 00:23.308
on a spreadsheet I glance at
every other quarter.

00:23.309 --> 00:26.687
You didn't, uh, borrow
me and Mae-Yi's road bikes

00:26.688 --> 00:28.272
last Saturday, did you?

00:28.273 --> 00:30.399
I just found out
that my friend has cancer

00:30.400 --> 00:33.318
and it's a little hard for me
to think about bikes right now.

00:33.319 --> 00:34.861
Come on, it's tattoo roulette.

00:34.862 --> 00:36.321
The surprise is half the fun.

00:36.322 --> 00:37.781
Emojis?

00:37.782 --> 00:39.324
They're our emojis.

00:39.325 --> 00:41.285
They're from our first text.

00:41.286 --> 00:44.204
So what, you're not into me anymore?

00:44.205 --> 00:45.497
You know that feeling

00:45.498 --> 00:47.666
when you get someone and they get you?

00:47.667 --> 00:49.126
Yeah.

00:49.127 --> 00:50.544
It's gone.

00:53.548 --> 00:54.923
I made a mistake.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.425
I want you back.

00:56.426 --> 00:58.218
Jesus, Drew.

00:58.219 --> 00:59.511
I'm dying.

00:59.512 --> 01:00.637
Where's Mom?

01:00.638 --> 01:02.055
Your mother has chosen to

01:02.056 --> 01:03.807
recuse herself from the situation.

01:03.808 --> 01:06.518
She finds this whole thing
a bit unpalatable.

01:06.519 --> 01:07.686
So we're supposed to take care of you?

01:07.687 --> 01:09.104
Unpalatable?

01:09.105 --> 01:10.772
I'll be euthanizing myself this evening.

01:10.773 --> 01:12.316
This is really what you want?

01:12.317 --> 01:13.567
It is.

01:15.695 --> 01:16.987
Guys?

01:20.783 --> 01:23.410
You're not really going back
to Drew, are you?

01:23.411 --> 01:25.245
No, I don't think I am.

01:25.246 --> 01:28.315
But it's time for me
to leave this house.

01:31.669 --> 01:34.212
It'd been, I don't know,
three weeks, a month.

01:34.213 --> 01:35.881
And I thought she was doing great.

01:35.882 --> 01:37.257
But then the phone rings...

01:37.258 --> 01:40.510
Two days. That's how long it took.

01:40.511 --> 01:42.596
Two days before the texting started.

01:42.597 --> 01:44.598
I wanted to believe
she could leave the nest,

01:44.599 --> 01:46.600
that she could fly, but...

01:46.601 --> 01:48.185
"Hi. How are you? What's going on?

01:48.186 --> 01:49.644
It's... oh... it rain."

01:49.645 --> 01:51.021
I get it. This is all new for her.

01:51.022 --> 01:52.522
A new house, a new world.

01:52.523 --> 01:53.815
It's like that scene
at the end of "Room."

01:53.816 --> 01:55.776
The smiley face, the winky face,

01:55.777 --> 01:57.486
the laugh-cry, cry-cry, the...

01:57.487 --> 01:59.613
And that neighborhood
is not safe at all.

01:59.614 --> 02:02.282
He's an emotional wheel of fortune.

02:02.283 --> 02:05.285
You know, it's just spinning
and spinning and spinning...

02:05.286 --> 02:08.330
She's crying out for help.
"Save me, save me, save me."

02:08.330 --> 02:09.663
Did I tell you that he's

02:09.664 --> 02:11.375
renting out bedrooms like a brothel?

02:11.376 --> 02:12.376
Well, does he

02:12.377 --> 02:13.835
make money from just the rooms

02:13.836 --> 02:15.837
or does he take a piece of the action?

02:15.838 --> 02:16.838
Brothel-wise?

02:16.839 --> 02:18.215
That's not funny because

02:18.216 --> 02:20.676
he... he could end up
with a serial killer.

02:20.677 --> 02:22.219
And serial killers really like

02:22.220 --> 02:25.972
the whole real apartment experience.

02:25.973 --> 02:28.308
You think I'm overreacting?

02:28.309 --> 02:29.434
Yes.

02:31.688 --> 02:33.397
Where is this fucking German?

02:33.398 --> 02:35.315
Thought their whole thing
was efficiency.

02:35.316 --> 02:36.525
German?

02:38.486 --> 02:39.487
Bye, Leon.

02:41.406 --> 02:44.324
Hans!

02:44.325 --> 02:46.410
Hans.

02:46.411 --> 02:48.620
Hans?

02:48.621 --> 02:49.663
Yes.

02:49.664 --> 02:51.249
How do I look?

02:53.876 --> 02:55.044
For what?

02:59.340 --> 03:01.050
Good night.

03:02.719 --> 03:04.094
Hot tub,

03:04.095 --> 03:05.679
record player, bar,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.515
laundry, kitchen that way.

03:08.516 --> 03:10.183
My room.

03:10.184 --> 03:12.395
Dad's charred remains.

03:14.522 --> 03:16.606
And your choice of bedroom.

03:16.607 --> 03:18.525
Left was my sister's.

03:18.526 --> 03:20.527
Right was my niece's.

03:20.528 --> 03:21.903
You really can't go wrong,
but I'm guessing

03:21.904 --> 03:24.197
less weird shit went down in that one.

03:25.533 --> 03:26.575
This will work.

03:26.576 --> 03:28.493
Great. All right, I gotta run,

03:28.494 --> 03:30.287
but text me if you need anything.

03:30.288 --> 03:32.372
Restaurant recs, bars.

03:32.373 --> 03:34.374
It's important you not
see this as an Airbnb

03:34.375 --> 03:36.918
but as your home away from home.

03:36.919 --> 03:38.503
I will try.

03:38.504 --> 03:40.505
Wunderbar.

03:40.506 --> 03:42.717
Don't forget to sign the guest book.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:01.694 --> 04:05.322
Yeah, I've been
working on some new stuff.

04:05.323 --> 04:06.781
And I'm reading.

04:06.782 --> 04:07.991
Playing the guitar.

04:07.992 --> 04:11.661
Just kind of catching up, you know?

04:11.662 --> 04:13.788
Wow.

04:13.789 --> 04:14.956
What?

04:14.957 --> 04:17.875
Nothin... I don't know, just...

04:17.877 --> 04:19.252
you sound good.

04:19.253 --> 04:21.422
Yeah, I think I am.

04:26.761 --> 04:28.512
How's Dad?

04:28.513 --> 04:29.971
Oh, you know,

04:29.972 --> 04:31.264
same old.

04:31.265 --> 04:33.892
- Is he haunting you yet?
- No.

04:33.893 --> 04:35.435
I'm sure they had to
bring in a bigger boat

04:35.436 --> 04:37.020
to get him across the Styx, so

04:37.021 --> 04:38.815
I doubt he's even settled in.

04:41.275 --> 04:44.194
We should think about
what to do with his ashes.

04:44.195 --> 04:46.530
I read that you can
plant them in a tree.

04:46.531 --> 04:48.865
He'd probably start some arboreal plague

04:48.866 --> 04:50.909
and turn the world
into a "Mad Max" desert.

04:50.910 --> 04:53.620
Yeah, probably.

04:53.621 --> 04:56.331
Maybe we could shoot him into space?

04:57.625 --> 04:59.835
Or... I've got it,

04:59.836 --> 05:01.086
make him into fireworks.

05:01.087 --> 05:02.462
Or a pencil set.

05:11.264 --> 05:12.514
I don't know, maybe we should just

05:12.515 --> 05:16.142
bury him in my backyard.

05:16.143 --> 05:19.063
Yeah. That's probably best.

05:29.740 --> 05:31.032
Did you valet?

05:31.033 --> 05:32.617
I'm around the corner.

05:32.618 --> 05:34.828
Oh, okay.

05:34.829 --> 05:36.997
- This was fun.
- Want to get another drink?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.085
You don't have to, I just

05:42.086 --> 05:43.336
like drinking.

05:43.337 --> 05:44.588
No, totally, um...

05:44.589 --> 05:45.714
It's just getting kind of late.

05:45.715 --> 05:47.465
I've got a long day tomorrow.

05:47.466 --> 05:49.509
Oh, yeah. Me too.

05:49.510 --> 05:52.178
You know, clients.

05:52.179 --> 05:54.639
You know.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.308
- It was good to catch up.
- Yeah.

05:56.309 --> 05:57.475
Let's do it again sometime soon.

05:57.476 --> 05:59.228
Yeah, of course.

06:07.486 --> 06:09.572
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

06:34.138 --> 06:36.139
Hello?

06:36.140 --> 06:37.223
Good night, Hans.

07:02.249 --> 07:03.333
Val, good morning.

07:03.334 --> 07:04.376
Hey, Tina.

07:04.377 --> 07:05.794
Oh, wow, isn't it perfect out?

07:05.819 --> 07:07.270
It's the kind of day
where you want to lie out

07:07.294 --> 07:08.922
and drink mimosas until dark.

07:08.923 --> 07:11.424
Yeah. That does sound very decadent.

07:11.425 --> 07:13.635
I... I just wanted to check back in

07:13.636 --> 07:14.761
about my sink.

07:14.762 --> 07:17.263
Oh... ugh. The sink.

07:17.264 --> 07:19.432
You are so right, and that is my bad.

07:19.433 --> 07:22.894
My handyman has been on
this soul searching expedition,

07:22.895 --> 07:24.521
and I didn't want to interrupt him

07:24.522 --> 07:27.315
unless it was absolutely necessary.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.984
But I see now that it is necessary.

07:29.985 --> 07:31.820
So you know what?
I'm gonna shoot him a text.

07:31.821 --> 07:33.446
How's that sound?

07:33.447 --> 07:34.698
That's great.

07:34.699 --> 07:36.366
- Thank you.
- No worries.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.493
And in the meantime,
enjoy this perfect morning.

07:39.787 --> 07:40.829
Yeah.

08:20.035 --> 08:22.704
Hans. Perfect timing.

08:22.705 --> 08:24.623
Pull up a chair.

08:27.501 --> 08:29.002
So how was your night?

08:29.003 --> 08:31.713
Seeing the sights?
Getting a feel for the city?

08:31.714 --> 08:34.006
Yeah. It's very nice.

08:34.008 --> 08:35.383
Great.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.427
And you're here for business? Pleasure?

08:37.428 --> 08:39.386
Not that those two things
are mutually exclusive

08:39.388 --> 08:41.597
and, really, it's sad
if they are, but...

08:41.599 --> 08:43.558
you know what I mean.

08:43.558 --> 08:45.685
I have a couple of meetings.

08:45.686 --> 08:46.686
- Then I...
- Hey.

08:46.687 --> 08:47.896
Question for you.

08:47.897 --> 08:49.314
Do you think

08:49.315 --> 08:51.608
our obsession with borders
and national identity

08:51.609 --> 08:54.903
is holding us back from creating
a global egalitarian society

08:54.904 --> 08:55.945
or

08:55.946 --> 08:58.031
are we, as animals in a

08:58.032 --> 08:59.866
world of scarce resources,

08:59.867 --> 09:04.205
simply destined for a life
of tribal infighting?

09:05.623 --> 09:06.582
That is

09:06.583 --> 09:08.249
a very complicated question.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.001
Oh, hm. Right?

09:10.002 --> 09:12.378
It's funny the things you think
about when you've got free time.

09:12.379 --> 09:14.047
Also I've been getting into soccer.

09:14.048 --> 09:16.132
Do you like Bayern Munich?

09:16.133 --> 09:17.258
Uh, yes.

09:17.259 --> 09:19.719
Mm. We should watch a game.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.804
Match?

09:20.805 --> 09:23.932
Thank you for the breakfast.

09:23.933 --> 09:27.227
Oh. Anytime.

09:27.228 --> 09:28.895
Let me know about that game.

09:35.069 --> 09:36.569
Your call has been forwarded

09:36.570 --> 09:38.404
to an automated voicemail service.

09:38.405 --> 09:40.240
- Leon.
- Is not available.

09:40.241 --> 09:42.575
At the tone, please record your message.

09:42.576 --> 09:44.077
Leon.

09:44.078 --> 09:45.411
It's me.

09:45.412 --> 09:47.580
I know your voicemail's
transcribing this.

09:47.581 --> 09:49.707
Does that happen in real time?

09:49.708 --> 09:52.585
Are you reading this right now?

09:52.586 --> 09:53.837
Is it accurate?

09:53.838 --> 09:56.506
So many questions. Call me. I miss you.

09:58.843 --> 10:00.426
Yes?

10:00.427 --> 10:01.427
I'm here.

10:01.428 --> 10:02.762
I can see that.

10:02.763 --> 10:04.889
You're also 48 minutes early, so...

10:04.890 --> 10:06.766
Yeah, figured you could
knock me out early

10:06.767 --> 10:09.561
and have the afternoon to yourself.

10:09.562 --> 10:11.271
Thoughtful, isn't it?

10:11.272 --> 10:13.648
Do you think that
you're my only patient?

10:13.649 --> 10:15.108
Of course not.

10:15.109 --> 10:16.192
Who you got in there?

10:16.193 --> 10:17.944
It's none of your business.

10:17.945 --> 10:19.404
Do they have problems?

10:19.405 --> 10:20.738
They do, don't they?

10:20.739 --> 10:22.031
Not worse than yours.

10:22.032 --> 10:24.117
Fair enough.

10:24.118 --> 10:25.952
How about a latte?

10:28.998 --> 10:30.623
Sit here.

10:30.624 --> 10:33.042
Don't move. Don't press any buttons.

10:33.043 --> 10:35.003
Literally or metaphorically?

10:40.092 --> 10:42.636
Leon, did all that transcribe too?

10:54.648 --> 10:56.691
Laura, if you ever
want to talk about anything,

10:56.692 --> 10:57.651
I'm here.

10:57.652 --> 11:01.488
It may not always seem like it, but I am.

11:08.871 --> 11:12.832
I want it off my body.

11:12.833 --> 11:15.835
Every time I see it, I think of him.

11:15.836 --> 11:19.589
What would that cost?

11:19.590 --> 11:21.257
4,000?

11:21.258 --> 11:25.136
Well, 4,500.

11:25.137 --> 11:28.932
What does your mother say?

11:28.933 --> 11:31.518
I don't think she really cares.

11:33.979 --> 11:35.563
Tell you what,

11:35.564 --> 11:37.023
you pay for half

11:37.024 --> 11:38.816
and I will pay for half.

11:38.817 --> 11:40.443
You get a summer job.

11:40.444 --> 11:41.653
Might be good for you.

11:41.654 --> 11:44.364
You might actually learn something.

11:44.365 --> 11:45.448
Really?

11:45.449 --> 11:47.617
Really.

11:48.619 --> 11:49.702
What?

11:49.703 --> 11:51.037
That was just

11:51.038 --> 11:53.998
an awfully normal
father-daughter moment.

11:53.999 --> 11:56.209
Well, I do have my days.

11:56.210 --> 11:57.835
Speaking of which,
do you want me to come

11:57.836 --> 11:59.754
to your grandfather's memorial?

11:59.755 --> 12:01.172
Memorial?

12:08.555 --> 12:10.848
Sure I can't get you something to drink?

12:12.393 --> 12:14.519
It's all right. I, uh,

12:14.979 --> 12:17.231
I think I've almost got it.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.819
Have you been talking to Alex?

12:22.820 --> 12:24.195
Not as much as he'd like.

12:24.196 --> 12:26.155
But he seems good to you, right?

12:26.156 --> 12:27.991
Like healthy?

12:29.118 --> 12:31.035
I mean, he's going to therapy.

12:31.036 --> 12:33.079
That's positive.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.873
Although Jennifer
wouldn't be my first choice.

12:35.874 --> 12:37.750
Um...

12:37.751 --> 12:39.127
I... I don't know.

12:39.128 --> 12:40.712
I mean, I guess I just thought he'd have

12:40.713 --> 12:44.007
more trouble with the
transition, you know, just...

12:44.008 --> 12:48.220
maybe reverting back
to his bullshit phases and...

12:50.931 --> 12:55.268
You have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

12:55.269 --> 12:56.352
No.

13:01.859 --> 13:04.444
Have you talked to Grandma?

13:10.117 --> 13:11.951
How do you not check your mail?

13:11.952 --> 13:14.120
- It's a lifestyle choice.
- No, it isn't.

13:14.121 --> 13:15.496
Jesus.

13:15.497 --> 13:17.332
It's giving me hives
just thinking about it.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.875
- What else is in here?
- I don't want to know.

13:18.876 --> 13:20.836
- That's why I don't open it.
- Oh.

13:26.008 --> 13:27.967
"Please join me in celebrating the life

13:27.968 --> 13:31.846
of Charles Cole, May 16th 5:30."

13:31.847 --> 13:33.890
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

13:33.891 --> 13:35.308
What?

13:35.309 --> 13:38.436
"Please bring your father."

13:38.437 --> 13:40.313
Oh, fuck that!

13:40.314 --> 13:41.647
She disappears without a word,

13:41.648 --> 13:43.566
and now she wants to play
grieving widow?

13:43.567 --> 13:45.860
She's not getting his ashes.

13:45.861 --> 13:47.278
We murdered him.

13:47.279 --> 13:48.905
We did the dirty work.

13:48.906 --> 13:51.741
She can't take that from us.

13:51.742 --> 13:53.701
Oh, Hans, Val.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.454
Val, Hans.

13:56.997 --> 13:59.208
Fucking unbelievable.

14:12.888 --> 14:16.265
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:16.266 --> 14:19.435
Tina's having a party.

14:19.436 --> 14:21.145
Where do you think I'm going?

14:24.274 --> 14:26.025
Hey, so, um, I talked to Dad.

14:26.026 --> 14:26.985
Mm-hmm?

14:26.986 --> 14:28.528
And he said he'd pay for

14:28.529 --> 14:30.196
half of my tattoo removal

14:30.197 --> 14:34.117
if you paid for the other half.

14:34.118 --> 14:36.410
Really?

14:36.411 --> 14:37.703
Yeah.

14:37.704 --> 14:39.080
So that's how he's parenting now?

14:39.081 --> 14:42.542
Just throwing money at a problem?

14:42.543 --> 14:46.212
Maybe he just
wanted to do something nice.

14:58.058 --> 14:59.350
Good night, Laura.

14:59.351 --> 15:01.270
Night, Mom.

15:21.665 --> 15:22.624
What?

15:22.625 --> 15:24.167
Oh, come on.

15:24.168 --> 15:25.293
This isn't even close

15:25.294 --> 15:27.712
to the worst thing I've done.

15:27.713 --> 15:29.047
True.

15:34.261 --> 15:37.263
It happened at night, 11:00,

15:37.264 --> 15:39.432
11:15.

15:39.433 --> 15:43.895
And it takes a while
for people to get there.

15:43.896 --> 15:46.272
So we waited,

15:46.273 --> 15:49.275
the three of us.

15:49.276 --> 15:51.736
And...

15:51.737 --> 15:55.281
nobody really said anything,

15:55.282 --> 15:58.951
because, I mean, what do you say?

15:58.952 --> 16:01.037
And then some people showed up.

16:01.038 --> 16:04.624
Paramedics, police.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.209
And they took some statements.

16:06.210 --> 16:08.461
They looked around the house for a bit.

16:08.462 --> 16:11.005
And...

16:11.006 --> 16:13.633
then they picked him up and took him.

16:13.634 --> 16:17.678
And then that was that.

16:17.679 --> 16:20.765
He was gone.

16:20.766 --> 16:25.311
Doesn't sound that different
from what he usually did.

16:25.312 --> 16:27.480
Coming and going.

16:27.481 --> 16:30.650
Okay.

16:30.651 --> 16:33.152
But the other times
I knew he'd come back.

16:33.153 --> 16:35.905
You said you hated that.

16:35.906 --> 16:37.782
When he'd just show up.

16:37.783 --> 16:40.576
I did.

16:40.577 --> 16:43.204
But then he came to me
in his final moments.

16:43.205 --> 16:46.165
He came to me when Mom ran away,

16:46.166 --> 16:47.541
and now she wants him back,

16:47.542 --> 16:50.211
but she doesn't deserve him.

16:50.212 --> 16:52.630
You mean she wants his ashes.

16:52.631 --> 16:54.257
Sure. Exactly.

16:54.258 --> 16:57.885
That's not the same as wanting him.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.971
It's more like

16:59.972 --> 17:02.014
the memory of him.

17:02.015 --> 17:06.018
Are you saying she doesn't deserve that?

17:06.019 --> 17:10.064
Is there a reason
why you're holding on to them?

17:10.065 --> 17:12.525
Why you haven't spread them?

17:12.526 --> 17:16.194
I kept them because
nobody else wanted them.

17:16.195 --> 17:18.156
Now someone does.

17:46.101 --> 17:47.226
Hello.

17:47.227 --> 17:48.853
How are you?

17:48.854 --> 17:51.063
I'm not going to your father's memorial

17:51.064 --> 17:53.941
so you don't have to worry
about bumping into me.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.026
Drew.

17:55.027 --> 17:57.653
Did you need something?

17:57.654 --> 17:59.280
Um...

17:59.281 --> 18:01.073
The... the plumber that we used to use

18:01.074 --> 18:03.242
with the little portable boom box.

18:03.243 --> 18:05.411
Do you have his number?

18:05.412 --> 18:07.830
I'll text it to you.

18:07.831 --> 18:09.915
Thank you.

18:09.916 --> 18:12.793
Glad to be of service.

18:14.004 --> 18:15.588
And, by the way, um,

18:15.589 --> 18:19.133
about the tattoo thing.

18:19.134 --> 18:21.427
I'll split it with you, I... I just...

18:21.428 --> 18:22.720
think that's something
that you should have

18:22.721 --> 18:26.432
talked to me about first.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.017
I didn't say we'd split it.

18:28.018 --> 18:29.560
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:29.561 --> 18:31.270
I told her if she got a job,
I'd pay for half.

18:31.271 --> 18:32.438
Uh-huh, yeah.

18:32.439 --> 18:34.023
Well, now she should get a job

18:34.024 --> 18:35.566
to pay for the whole thing,
don't you agree?

18:35.567 --> 18:37.818
- Yeah... yes, I agree.
- Okay.

18:37.819 --> 18:39.320
- I'm saying I agree.
- Great.

18:39.321 --> 18:40.780
- Okay.
- Take care.

18:40.781 --> 18:42.157
You too.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.037
What's up?

18:48.038 --> 18:50.790
Why would you lie to me
about the tattoo?

18:50.791 --> 18:53.709
Because I'm a teenager?

18:53.710 --> 18:55.252
Also, I figured you'd be busy

18:55.253 --> 18:56.629
dealing with your own stuff.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.172
Well,

18:58.173 --> 18:59.465
if you want it removed,

18:59.466 --> 19:01.467
you can earn the money yourself.

19:01.468 --> 19:02.635
All of it.

19:04.805 --> 19:06.013
Fine.

19:09.476 --> 19:12.103
Dad.

19:12.104 --> 19:14.146
I don't know if you can hear me,

19:14.147 --> 19:15.981
but in the off chance

19:15.982 --> 19:18.025
you're floating on a cloud
with a harp and not

19:18.026 --> 19:21.112
toiling away in some sulfuric hellscape,

19:21.113 --> 19:24.365
I, um...

19:24.366 --> 19:26.033
Hans?

19:26.034 --> 19:27.993
No. Do not get up.

19:27.994 --> 19:29.662
Where are you going?

19:29.663 --> 19:31.997
I no longer wish to stay here.

19:31.998 --> 19:33.249
What? Wait.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.333
No.

19:34.334 --> 19:35.501
Come on. I'm sorry.

19:35.502 --> 19:37.378
Stay. I'll make you a waffle.

19:37.379 --> 19:38.296
Huh?

19:38.297 --> 19:40.047
We'll talk it out.

19:41.008 --> 19:42.258
The tribes.

19:42.259 --> 19:44.343
The tribes and the infighting.

19:44.344 --> 19:46.095
That is my answer.

19:46.096 --> 19:47.680
What?

19:47.681 --> 19:49.265
Auf Wiedersehen.

20:00.152 --> 20:01.652
Oh, hey. Sorry.

20:01.653 --> 20:03.904
Hans left early. Can you believe it?

20:03.905 --> 20:05.531
He's gonna kill my host rating.

20:05.532 --> 20:07.575
I may need you to write
some fake reviews.

20:07.576 --> 20:10.286
Alex, what the fuck?

20:10.287 --> 20:13.414
Oh. Right, um. I talked to Jennifer.

20:13.415 --> 20:17.376
And she said it's not like we're
actually giving Dad to Mom.

20:17.377 --> 20:18.753
It's more like we're just

20:18.754 --> 20:21.172
transferring his memory
to someone who needs it.

20:21.173 --> 20:23.549
You didn't think I'd want a say in that?

20:23.550 --> 20:25.009
Do you?

20:25.010 --> 20:25.927
Yes.

20:25.928 --> 20:27.511
We talked about it.

20:27.512 --> 20:30.014
What... at dinner?

20:30.015 --> 20:31.223
With the pencil set?

20:31.224 --> 20:32.808
I... I thought we were doing a bit.

20:32.809 --> 20:35.853
God. Even when I'm gone,
you manage to punish me.

20:35.854 --> 20:38.397
Darlings.

20:38.398 --> 20:40.941
You don't know how much
this means to me.

20:40.942 --> 20:44.904
Your presence is
a kind and thoughtful gesture.

20:44.905 --> 20:48.699
And... and this must be...

20:48.700 --> 20:51.118
Oh, Charles.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.538
How wonderful to hold you
in my arms again.

20:54.539 --> 20:57.416
Laura, will you come and
help me find a place for him?

20:57.417 --> 20:59.877
You can fill me in
on everything I've missed.

20:59.878 --> 21:01.670
Mm. Where to begin?

21:40.544 --> 21:42.294
N... no.

21:42.295 --> 21:43.672
No-no-no.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.722
Hey. Tina.

21:53.723 --> 21:55.683
Yes, hi, it's Valerie.

21:57.602 --> 21:59.144
Y-yes. O-okay.

21:59.145 --> 22:02.314
Um, I don't care where your handyman is.

22:02.315 --> 22:05.568
Hire a plumber and have him
fix my fucking sink

22:05.569 --> 22:06.986
before I get home, okay?

22:06.987 --> 22:09.154
That is your job.
That is what you signed up for.

22:09.155 --> 22:10.739
And you don't get to
just check out because

22:10.740 --> 22:14.660
you don't feel like
doing the work, okay?

22:14.661 --> 22:16.121
Thank you.

22:24.671 --> 22:25.880
Oh, God.

22:42.022 --> 22:43.690
Thank you.

22:48.778 --> 22:50.751
Your mom's pretty mad at me, huh?

22:51.948 --> 22:54.040
Indeed.

22:54.868 --> 22:57.157
Is she not doing well?

22:58.788 --> 23:00.247
She's the same,

23:00.248 --> 23:01.248
but worse.

23:03.376 --> 23:05.066
How 'bout you?

23:05.795 --> 23:07.421
You know, people always ask me that,

23:07.422 --> 23:11.717
and I don't think they
really want to hear the answer.

23:11.718 --> 23:15.220
That's mostly true.

23:15.221 --> 23:17.431
I need a job.

23:17.432 --> 23:19.308
Me too.

23:19.309 --> 23:23.187
Well, maybe we could work together.

23:23.188 --> 23:24.897
If I see a listing
for a high school student

23:24.898 --> 23:26.565
and a failed entrepreneur,
I'll let you know.

23:26.566 --> 23:29.026
Well, technically,
I'm not even in high school.

23:29.027 --> 23:30.027
Even better.

23:36.534 --> 23:38.744
Go on.

23:53.426 --> 23:57.429
You know, this is hard for me too.

23:57.430 --> 24:00.015
It's new and it's different

24:00.016 --> 24:02.017
and I'm trying to be okay with it,

24:02.018 --> 24:05.771
but sometimes I just want to call you

24:05.772 --> 24:09.608
and tell you everything and then
I remember that I shouldn't.

24:09.609 --> 24:11.402
Just because we don't live together

24:11.403 --> 24:13.530
doesn't mean we can't talk.

24:15.615 --> 24:18.451
I'm sorry about the ashes.

24:22.330 --> 24:26.083
His last words to me were,

24:26.084 --> 24:29.921
"Sorry we weren't closer,
but maybe it's for the best."

24:32.090 --> 24:34.133
What is that?
I mean, that's not closure.

24:34.134 --> 24:38.762
That's... that's something
you say to a stranger.

24:38.763 --> 24:40.389
His last words to me were,

24:40.390 --> 24:44.143
"You have your sister,

24:44.144 --> 24:46.813
and that's a real love."

24:52.152 --> 24:53.986
Well.

24:53.987 --> 24:55.654
Wish I'd been around when he said that.

24:55.655 --> 24:57.449
That would have been a better memory.

25:02.287 --> 25:03.662
Come gather round.

25:03.663 --> 25:05.749
I'd like to say a few words.

25:10.211 --> 25:12.088
Save my seat.

25:18.595 --> 25:23.098
Are you drinking?

25:23.099 --> 25:25.225
Yes?

25:25.226 --> 25:27.812
Can I have some?

25:30.482 --> 25:32.691
Thank you all for coming.

25:32.692 --> 25:34.860
I know Charles would be overjoyed

25:34.861 --> 25:39.156
to see such a collection
of friends and family.

25:39.157 --> 25:42.076
While we weren't always together,

25:42.077 --> 25:46.038
we were in the times that counted most.

25:46.039 --> 25:48.707
The trips around the world.

25:48.708 --> 25:52.504
The long nights spent
in each other's arms.

25:54.380 --> 25:57.424
Charles was a special man.

25:57.425 --> 26:01.095
He was a man of particular taste
and temperament.

26:01.096 --> 26:03.597
While he had his detractors,

26:03.598 --> 26:05.724
he was always true to himself.

26:05.725 --> 26:06.934
Where are your shoes?

26:06.935 --> 26:08.936
A quality I will forever cherish.

26:08.937 --> 26:11.105
Check your bag.

26:11.106 --> 26:15.400
But perhaps the thing
I'll remember most about Charles

26:15.401 --> 26:17.569
is his selflessness,

26:17.570 --> 26:21.073
his sense of charity.

26:21.074 --> 26:24.076
You didn't.

26:24.077 --> 26:26.745
We'll keep the memories for ourselves.

26:26.746 --> 26:29.414
For him to take me in,

26:29.415 --> 26:33.001
a single pregnant woman,

26:33.002 --> 26:37.464
and raise my daughter as his own,

26:37.465 --> 26:40.050
that speaks to his depth

26:40.051 --> 26:44.054
and preponderance of character.

26:44.055 --> 26:48.476
And for that, our family
will be eternally grateful.

26:58.486 --> 26:59.788
S...

26:59.863 --> 27:02.156
I'm s... I'm sorry.
