This transmitter is all
we could scrounge up.

00:18.580 --> 00:19.670
What do you think?

00:19.670 --> 00:21.540
Well, I can boost
the power,

00:21.540 --> 00:24.040
but not enough to overcome
the Empire's jamming signal.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.670
They're blocking all
non-Imperial transmissions.

00:26.670 --> 00:28.830
We have to find a way
to make contact with Hera.

00:28.830 --> 00:31.080
If she made it past
the blockade.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.120
She made it.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.460
And she'll convince rebel
command to launch an attack.

00:35.460 --> 00:36.920
We need to be ready to help.

Look, I want to fight,

00:39.830 --> 00:42.040
but the Empire's got
thousands of troops.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.670
We are hiding in a cave
with no ships, no supplies,

00:45.670 --> 00:47.330
and a couple of blasters.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.830
We've done a lot more
with a lot less.

I can't make contact
outside the planet,

00:56.790 --> 00:59.960
but I'm picking up something
transmitting nearby.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.830
How close?

01:00.830 --> 01:03.000
Close enough to take a look.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.880

There. It's an ore crawler.

EZRA: I think I saw
some of those burning through
the grasslands up north.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.250
RYDER: Yeah. They strip rake
the surface for raw materials

01:28.250 --> 01:30.790
to feed the Imperial factory.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.790
And they've burned
all the way down here?

01:32.790 --> 01:34.790
That's halfway
across the planet.

01:34.790 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, but that ship
might be just what we need.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.790
SABINE: You might be more
right than you know, Zeb.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.580
That crawler is equipped
with a long-range
communications array.

01:45.580 --> 01:47.000
One that can reach Hera?

02:11.920 --> 02:13.830

02:13.830 --> 02:16.960
In single ship-to-ship

02:16.960 --> 02:21.000
Our analysts have yet to find
a weakness in its design.

If we can't find
a way to fight this thing,

02:23.500 --> 02:26.500
it's imperative we prevent it
from being mass-produced.

Your evidence
is persuasive, Captain,

to discuss further action.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.620
Stay out of my chair!

14:10.620 --> 14:14.330
By the moons of Gozgo,
I hope this works.

14:14.330 --> 14:16.420
MAN: (OVER COMLINK)
Repeat transmit security code,

14:16.420 --> 14:17.830
or we will open fire.

14:17.830 --> 14:19.380
Uh, this is the captain.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.750
Uh, 93-94.
How may I help you?

14:22.750 --> 14:25.710
The Mining Guild reported
a security alert
for this vessel.

14:25.710 --> 14:28.540
Hey, you sure
Vizago won't turn us in
to save himself?

14:28.540 --> 14:29.580
Too late now.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.750
We're having
a maintenance issue

14:31.750 --> 14:34.790
and lost our security code,

14:34.790 --> 14:36.620
uh, but everything
is under control.

14:36.620 --> 14:39.210
SEEVOR: (POUNDING ON DOOR)
Kick the bums out!

14:39.210 --> 14:41.380
Scoundrels, all of them!

14:42.790 --> 14:44.620
Repeat that, Captain.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.620
I was yelling
at my slaves!

14:47.620 --> 14:49.750
They were being insolent!

14:49.750 --> 14:50.830
Prepare to be boarded.

14:50.830 --> 14:53.750
No, no, no, no, no,
that is not necessary.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.000
I am trying to run
an operation here.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.120
What are you looking at?
Get working.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.620
Eh, you can't get
good help these days.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.460
Squad two,
sweep the lower decks.

15:11.460 --> 15:12.880
The rest of you, with me.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.170
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

15:14.170 --> 15:17.120
I told you everything
was under control.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.000
I'll have to report
this intrusion

15:19.000 --> 15:20.790
to the Mining Guild.

15:20.790 --> 15:22.580
Step aside, Captain.

15:23.830 --> 15:27.380
All right, let me show you
our output data logs.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.330
They aren't nearly as boring
as you would think.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.750
(KEYS CLACKING)

15:33.830 --> 15:36.670
All we need is that lizard
to start flapping
his mouth again.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.000
There is nothing in there!

15:46.000 --> 15:47.460
Get back.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.620
Oh, but, please,
see for yourself.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.670
Gone.

16:03.670 --> 16:04.750
I mean, see?

16:04.750 --> 16:06.210
Nothing there.

16:06.210 --> 16:07.710
If you'd like
a full inspection,

16:07.710 --> 16:08.790
I can give you one.

16:08.790 --> 16:10.880
It shouldn't take longer
than a couple of hours.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.000
You may have that kind
of time, but we do not.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.120
Now get this crawler
operational.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.790
Of course.
I was just going to do that.

16:19.790 --> 16:22.380
Squad, move out.

16:22.380 --> 16:25.210
Don't worry.
We'll be crawling in no time.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.120
(ENGINES WHIRRING)

16:36.250 --> 16:37.750
Nice work, Vizago.

16:37.750 --> 16:38.920
You haven't lost
your game.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.000
Like Mother said,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.170
"Once a scoundrel,
always a scoundrel."

16:42.170 --> 16:43.460
But we have a problem.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.710
Where's Captain 93-94?

16:46.420 --> 16:47.830
He got loose.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.790
Guys, I think
I've got it.

16:50.790 --> 16:52.620
Transmitting to Hera now.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.580
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

16:54.580 --> 16:55.920
That doesn't sound good.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.790
Transmitter's lost power?

16:57.790 --> 17:00.880
SEEVOR: (OVER COMLINK)
I told you not to mess
with me.

17:00.880 --> 17:04.750
You may have duped
those Imperial suckers,

17:04.750 --> 17:08.170
but you won't fool
the Mining Guild.

17:08.170 --> 17:10.330
That sneaky
little lizard.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.880
How'd he get a comlink?

17:11.880 --> 17:13.620
He's on
the crawler's intercom,

17:13.620 --> 17:15.920
and he's sabotaged power
to the long-range transmitter.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.880
Patch me through
to the Empire,

17:17.880 --> 17:20.750
or I will destroy
this crawler,

17:20.750 --> 17:22.960
you pirate scum!

17:22.960 --> 17:24.500
We're not pirates.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.580
Haven't you figured
that out by now?

17:31.540 --> 17:34.420
We've got to find him before
he sabotages this whole thing.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.380
He's in
the ventilation shafts.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.790
He could be anywhere
in there.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.750
His target will be
the main reactor core
in the refinery.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.290
(SIGHS) Come on.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.750
(GRUNTING)

17:56.460 --> 17:57.620
We can't get in.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.580
He's locked
the refinery doors.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.040
Ah, I can't cut
through either.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.620
They're magnetically sealed.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.330
Well, then we need
someone capable

18:04.330 --> 18:06.670
of navigating
those ventilation shafts.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.000
Oh, no, no, no.
I am not going in there.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.830
It's a ventilation shaft.
It's what you do.

18:13.830 --> 18:17.790
If Vizago can fool Empire,
Jedi can climb into shaft.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.500
(AIR HISSING)
(COUGHS)

18:23.500 --> 18:25.250
I don't do this anymore.

KANAN: Ezra, hurry!

18:32.750 --> 18:34.830
We can't let him
destroy the reactor.

18:34.830 --> 18:38.170
SABINE: Ezra?
Ezra, are you there?
What do you see?

18:38.170 --> 18:40.120
ZEB: Kid's probably
taking a nap.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.540
(DOOR POUNDING)

18:47.540 --> 18:50.500
I'm here. Oh, he shut down
the reactors, all right.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.380
SABINE: Okay,
to turn them back on,

18:52.380 --> 18:54.460
find the primary
power console.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.790
It should be across
from the furnace.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.460
Found it.

This is my crawler, rebel.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.000
I work for the Guild,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.420
just as he who spawned me

after me.

Watch out.

We made a believer
out of you yet, Ryder?

You're getting there, Kanan.

Well, I beamed our signal
to rebel command.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.120
Now we just have to wait
for a reply.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.290
Guess this crawler
belongs to us.

20:28.290 --> 20:30.670
Maybe we are pirates
after all.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.960
At least these plains
have been spared. For now.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.170
That is not all
you spared.

20:39.170 --> 20:42.080
I know you did not come here
to rescue Vizago,

20:42.080 --> 20:44.080
but I am grateful
all the same.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.080
And we're grateful
to you, Vizago,
for not turning us in.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.380
You're all free now.

20:49.380 --> 20:52.880
But we could use your help
to fight the Empire on Lothal.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.170
(STAMMERING) Yes, we...

20:54.170 --> 20:55.670

with the big purple beast.

20:55.670 --> 20:56.670
We will fight!

20:57.880 --> 20:59.710
As for this vessel,

20:59.710 --> 21:02.080
it is obviously in need
of a new captain.

I think I know
just the pirate
for the job.

from you guys.

authorized the attack.

We're launching our assault
on the next rotation.

you'll coordinate
the ground assault.
