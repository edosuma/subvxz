00:25.000 --> 00:29.200
<i>Being a married man's mistress</i>
<i>is like being in the midst of flames.</i>

00:31.160 --> 00:35.080
<i>Do you know what it means</i>
<i>to be loved by the King of England?</i>

00:36.280 --> 00:37.920
<i>Why should I trust you?</i>

00:38.800 --> 00:41.000
<i>You would make a great Queen,</i>

00:41.080 --> 00:44.320
<i>but he already has one,</i>
<i>and the people love Katherine.</i>

00:46.240 --> 00:48.440
<i>Whatever this is, it's over.</i>

00:51.360 --> 00:54.160
<i>You're making</i>
<i>a big mistake. </i>

00:54.960 --> 00:58.720
<i>You've just thrown away your future,</i>
<i>your family's future!</i>

00:58.800 --> 01:00.120
<i>-I love you, Anne!</i>

01:04.160 --> 01:05.000
Come in.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.840
Married? Really?

01:40.920 --> 01:43.680
-Mm-hmm!
-Yeah, in your dreams!

01:43.760 --> 01:48.360
Well, there's whispers in court
that Henry is angling for an annulment.

01:48.440 --> 01:53.080
The pope will never go for that.
Surely that's a bit of a problem.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.160
It's obvious Katherine's
too old to conceive,

01:55.240 --> 01:56.720
and the King still needs a son.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.640
Did he <i>actually </i>say
he was going to marry you, Anne?

02:01.320 --> 02:02.160
'Course.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.080
More or less.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.160
Some of Henry's letters to Anne
were very sexually explicit.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.440
It's clear that he was
absolutely obsessed with the idea

02:14.520 --> 02:15.600
of having sex with her.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.160
He writes to her.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.920
He wants "of an evening
to kiss her duckies,"

02:23.000 --> 02:25.280
which is the Tudor slang for breasts.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.400
During the course of those letters,
something shifts,

02:29.480 --> 02:30.960
and there is a moment

02:31.040 --> 02:35.240
when Henry seems to be
more firmly committed to Anne.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.680
There were plenty of things
he couldn't say out loud,

02:40.760 --> 02:42.320
like, "Will you marry me?"

02:42.400 --> 02:44.560
But that's what he wanted.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.920
And inviting me back to court,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.640
promising to acknowledge <i>me</i>
as the one he loved,

02:52.720 --> 02:54.240
only confirmed that.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.840
Anne is back at court,

02:57.920 --> 03:00.120
but this time, things are different,

03:00.200 --> 03:05.640
because Henry has promised to try
and make her his wife and queen.

03:05.720 --> 03:10.680
The idea that the King of England
might set aside his first wife

03:10.760 --> 03:12.600
and marry someone else

03:12.680 --> 03:14.120
was deeply shocking.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.680
Henry is still married
to Katherine of Aragon.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.320
You're back.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.680
Again.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.720
It's exquisite, isn't it?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.520
A gift from Henry. It was his mother's.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.240
Oh.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.280
That's… so sweet.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.800
By now, Katherine is used
to her husband's infidelities,

04:01.880 --> 04:06.040
so Katherine probably thinks
that this is just another one of those,

04:06.120 --> 04:09.840
he'll lose interest in Anne
as quickly as he has all of the others.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.520
Oh, I can't believe we're back!

04:13.760 --> 04:16.120
And this time with some actual leverage.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.520
Katherine thinks I'm a joke.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.760
What did you expect? A high five?

04:31.840 --> 04:34.840
-You're trying to steal her husband.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.600
But he doesn't love her.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.040
Does it matter?

04:40.600 --> 04:44.080
It's weird to think
she was married to Henry's brother first.

04:44.160 --> 04:48.840
I remember that. Yeah, he dies,
and then she turns up on Henry's arm.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.840
Well, they didn't exactly have a choice
about that.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.640
I could be just as good a queen
as Katherine, you know?

04:59.160 --> 05:00.600
In <i>that </i>dress, you could.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.680
What are you worrying about?

05:11.280 --> 05:12.320
Beautiful.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.840
Virtuous.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.440
Driven.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.920
Greatest queen ever.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.640
You'll need to take the rest later.
Henry wanted you to have my old rooms.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.240
Never been that keen on this place anyway.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.880
We'll be out of here by midday.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.680
Oh, I didn't realize.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.440
I wouldn't renovate too much,

05:37.520 --> 05:40.760
seeing as your stay here
will most likely be temporary.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.800
Anne and Wolsey are old rivals.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.080
They have history.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.120
Wolsey sees Anne
as a passing fancy for the King,

05:54.200 --> 05:57.520
not as the real threat
that she actually is.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.840
Bon voyage!

06:05.200 --> 06:06.760
Absolutely stunning.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.280
Yes. Yes, it is.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.240
I was talking about you.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.480
I'll go check on the rest of your stuff.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.800
Your Majesty.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.840
-I brought you a whip.
-Oh?

06:25.920 --> 06:26.880
For riding.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.120
I'm taking you out.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.800
Well, I've nothing to wear.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.080
I've already picked something out for you.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.520
You do ride, don't you?

06:41.080 --> 06:44.480
I'm not sure you've the stamina
to keep up with me, Your Majesty.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.960
You stay here with the horses.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.080
My rules, remember?

07:31.040 --> 07:33.720
It's been a long time
since I've had such good company riding.

07:35.240 --> 07:40.280
Where are you with, um,<i> le</i> annulment?

07:41.320 --> 07:42.400
I'm working on it.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.080
I promise you.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.360
I haven't gone near her in years.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.240
She's more interested in the Bible
than carnal pleasure.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.160
Surely not a Bible written in English.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.320
Of course not. The Bible should be read
in Latin, as it's always been.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.120
-I hear you want them burned.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.840
Books or the heretics?

08:01.920 --> 08:02.760
Both.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.720
Well, they know the consequences
for getting caught.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.200
Does the punishment fit the crime?

08:28.080 --> 08:28.920
Henry!

08:31.120 --> 08:32.840
-What happened?

08:37.240 --> 08:38.080
Gotcha!

08:39.040 --> 08:40.760
-Ooh!
-Anne, I'm…

08:41.680 --> 08:44.080
Anne, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.360
-Get off me!
-I'm sorry.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.200
Please, forgive me.

08:47.880 --> 08:48.720
Gotcha!

09:25.920 --> 09:29.080
I want the baby I'll carry
to be the next King of England.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.120
That's everything that I've longed for.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.520
By the time Henry VIII was King,

09:42.600 --> 09:45.440
the Tudors were still quite a new dynasty,

09:45.520 --> 09:47.560
and a fragile one as well,

09:47.640 --> 09:49.600
so he was very painfully aware

09:49.680 --> 09:53.840
that he had to produce a son
to strengthen the throne.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.320
Anne cannot get pregnant
before they're married,

09:56.400 --> 09:58.600
because that means
any heir is illegitimate.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.200
They have to do this properly.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.760
He needs a legitimate heir
for the Tudor throne.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.840
Well, if you want me,
you'll have to marry me first.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.640
I will.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.720
I want it all.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.640
I want you

10:16.120 --> 10:17.040
to be mine.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.560
From that very first date together,

10:40.120 --> 10:41.120
I loved him.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.480
But there were things…

10:46.680 --> 10:47.880
that he didn't know,

10:49.160 --> 10:50.920
things that I couldn't show him.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.520
I knew that Henry was prone
to burning heretics at the stake,

10:55.040 --> 10:59.600
and in a way, I was a bit of a heretic…

11:00.200 --> 11:02.720
…what with
my controversial reading materials.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.680
I was playing a dangerous game.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.280
Another gift from Henry, by any chance?

11:26.360 --> 11:28.120
-Certainly is.

11:29.120 --> 11:34.040
Well, I'm guessing that
your first proper date went well, hmm?

11:34.560 --> 11:37.880
Because your new boyfriend's just made me

11:38.800 --> 11:43.840
Esquire of the Body
and Master of the Buckhounds.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.040
That is an absolutely ridiculous title,

11:47.120 --> 11:50.080
but if you tell me you're important,
then, woof, I'm impressed.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.120
Well, when you're not looking
into lover boy's eyes,

11:53.200 --> 11:55.920
I thought that you might like
to look at this.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.880
<i>The Obedience of a Christian Man</i>
by William Tyndale.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.960
It says that the King
should answer to no one,

12:08.720 --> 12:10.120
not even the pope.

12:11.960 --> 12:15.240
I thought it might be the answer
to your little Katherine problem.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.840
Controversial.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.200
Seriously heretical.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.240
Don't get caught with this, Anne.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.960
Anne and her brother George
have clearly embraced

12:27.040 --> 12:29.800
some of these radical religious ideas

12:29.880 --> 12:33.440
that are starting to spread
across England,

12:33.520 --> 12:35.400
and this is dangerous for them.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.200
It's against the official religion,

12:38.280 --> 12:40.680
and the punishment for that is death.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.600
What are you two up to?

12:42.680 --> 12:43.840
Uh…

12:44.520 --> 12:47.680
I was just telling Anne
about my promotion.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.400
I thought we could celebrate your new job.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.320
That sounds lovely,

12:55.400 --> 12:59.360
but those hounds,
they won't look after themselves.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.440
Anne has in her possession

13:12.520 --> 13:15.680
one of the most controversial books
on the face of the earth,

13:15.760 --> 13:19.280
William Tyndale's
<i>Obedience of a Christian Man.</i>

13:19.360 --> 13:20.360
This is dynamite.

13:20.440 --> 13:25.280
This book sets out
that the King should be above the pope.

13:25.360 --> 13:30.000
It challenges the very foundations
of the Roman Catholic faith.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.160
William Tyndale is on the run
from the King of England

13:33.240 --> 13:36.120
for translating the Bible into English.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.680
This is considered illegal
in Henry's England.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.840
This is heresy, and this is something
that can lead you to the stake.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.040
Are you still reading that?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.840
Oh God, what time is it?
I'm going to be late!

13:52.920 --> 13:54.240
Book down, bling on!

13:54.320 --> 13:55.760
Lock it away for me, would you?

13:55.840 --> 13:56.800
Yep.

13:57.320 --> 14:00.320
Certainly don't want this little piece
of dynamite lying around.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.480
If King Henry found it,
everything could go up in flames.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.400
Enjoy the ménage à trois!

14:25.640 --> 14:29.120
So now Henry is living
with both the women under the same roof.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.200
They're constantly
coming across each other.

14:32.280 --> 14:36.040
That is grating on Anne like anything.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.160
Incredibly, this game of cards
actually happened.

15:04.240 --> 15:08.720
Katherine and Anne and Henry
sat down to play cards.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.880
Now the atmosphere must have been toxic.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.880
Katherine shooting looks of pure hatred
at Anne,

15:16.960 --> 15:19.560
Henry probably enjoying the whole thing,

15:19.640 --> 15:23.760
and as for Anne herself,
well, she certainly enjoyed a challenge.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.680
I'm tired of games.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.800
Good night.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.640
Underestimating Anne

16:00.720 --> 16:04.000
will come to be
Katherine's greatest mistake.

16:08.200 --> 16:13.080
I wish Katherine had accepted it was over
when everyone else knew that it was.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.800
It wasn't just
that she hadn't given Henry a male heir.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.040
It's that they didn't love each other.
What did she expect him to do?

16:20.120 --> 16:23.920
One thing that wasn't in any doubt
was that Henry loved me

16:24.000 --> 16:26.240
more than he'd ever loved Katherine.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.600
And we <i>were </i>going to be together.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.520
Anne.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.280
I've told you so many times,
I will not be your mistress.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.280
-You're not.
-That's not what she thinks!

16:40.360 --> 16:43.160
Look, Wolsey's still working out
the finer details,

16:43.240 --> 16:46.280
but the crux of it is
we need to convince the pope

16:46.360 --> 16:49.320
that my marriage to Katherine
wasn't valid in the first place.

16:51.480 --> 16:54.640
And how exactly do you plan on doing that?

16:54.720 --> 16:56.800
Well, the Church
only agreed to the marriage

16:56.880 --> 16:59.400
because Katherine said
she didn't sleep with my brother.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.040
-Do you think she lied?
-She could have.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.320
God's punished me as a consequence.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.000
Leviticus 20 verse 21.

17:08.080 --> 17:11.080
"If a man marries his brother's wife,
they would be without a son."

17:11.160 --> 17:12.080
Exactly.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.280
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

17:17.040 --> 17:18.480
We need to prove it.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.400
We convinced Wolsey
to swing a divorce hearing,

17:22.480 --> 17:27.920
but Katherine had absolutely no intention
of giving up without a fight.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.480
The marriage is tried

17:30.560 --> 17:34.360
at a court at Blackfriars in July 1529,

17:34.440 --> 17:36.840
and presiding over it are Wolsey

17:36.920 --> 17:40.400
and the pope's man,
Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio.

17:40.480 --> 17:44.200
Securing a divorce for the King
is no easy matter.

17:44.280 --> 17:48.360
It needs the authority,
the approval, of the pope.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.280
Henry stands up.

17:51.360 --> 17:56.160
He says he has been troubled
by the scruples of his conscience,

17:56.240 --> 18:01.320
that his mind and heart
can't deal with living this lie,

18:01.400 --> 18:03.640
being married to his brother's widow.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.760
Stop pacing. You're making me queasy!

18:06.840 --> 18:08.280
I can't help it!

18:08.360 --> 18:10.360
So much hangs on this!

18:14.200 --> 18:15.720
Out!

18:16.680 --> 18:19.080
Katherine had a meltdown.
Threw herself at my feet.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.040
What?

18:20.120 --> 18:22.560
She swore she was a virgin
when we were first married.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.680
Said God should be the judge in her case.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.520
The pope's man refused to pass judgment.
Wolsey said it's a pointless exercise.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.920
No one's going to buy it.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.640
He says it's all over.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.280
Like hell it is.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.640
The failure of the trial

18:50.720 --> 18:55.080
means that everything
that Henry and Anne have been hoping for

18:55.160 --> 18:57.320
has just crashed into the dust.

18:57.400 --> 19:01.640
They've been waiting
for more than two years

19:01.720 --> 19:04.120
to be together formally,

19:04.200 --> 19:06.920
and Katherine has scuppered it all.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.440
Henry was used to Wolsey
doing whatever he asked him.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.800
He'd served him faithfully
for about 20 years,

19:15.880 --> 19:18.040
but now Wolsey is failing.

19:18.120 --> 19:23.320
He hasn't managed to get the King
the divorce that he so desperately needs.

19:23.400 --> 19:27.080
Katherine can't get away with this!
There must be another way!

19:29.680 --> 19:30.880
We've tried everything.

19:31.720 --> 19:35.360
Well, what about the pope?
I thought you had some sway with him.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.520
The pope will never go against Katherine.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.480
She has friends in high places.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.760
We must accept
the things we cannot change.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.160
I'm not giving up.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.600
Just because you think
rules don't apply to you

19:50.520 --> 19:52.800
doesn't mean you won't fall foul of them.

19:54.480 --> 19:58.160
So a man of the Church
with a mistress and two kids

19:59.120 --> 20:00.720
wants to talk about rules?

20:04.400 --> 20:09.000
Living here as the King's bit on the side
is already above your station.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.440
I wouldn't aim any higher if I were you.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.880
Yours, I believe?

20:23.640 --> 20:24.760
Where did you get that?

20:26.320 --> 20:28.880
I'd hate for it
to find its way to the King.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.840
The fact
that Anne has this book in her keeping

20:36.920 --> 20:39.280
spells mortal danger.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.760
If she's found with it,

20:40.840 --> 20:43.960
she could be arrested
and burnt at the stake as a heretic.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.480
She has to get to the King
before anyone else does,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.280
because only the King can save her now.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.240
-Where did you get this?
-It's… It's mine.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.160
Henry, you have to read this.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.560
It could change our lives. It…

21:02.080 --> 21:03.720
It could change everything.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.120
It says a king is born
not just to be king,

21:09.200 --> 21:12.480
but to be head of a new world order
subject only to God,

21:12.560 --> 21:15.080
and the pope cannot tell him what to do.

21:15.160 --> 21:18.200
This is a way
to throw off the pope's tyranny

21:18.280 --> 21:20.360
and restore your God-given right to rule.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.640
You would answer to no one but God.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.120
Not even me.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.520
You don't need permission from anyone.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.400
I see Anne has confessed all.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.040
We need to talk, Wolsey.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.400
Anne has marked passages

22:03.480 --> 22:08.240
that talk about the King's authority
in his own realm being above the pope's.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.440
They speak to her.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.440
The pope is the head of the Church.

22:11.520 --> 22:16.000
He is in charge
of everyone in Christendom,

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
but across Europe,

22:18.160 --> 22:22.960
people have converted
to this new way of thinking about belief.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.720
There is a divide happening.

22:24.800 --> 22:29.680
That what has been one Church
is being painfully cleaved into two.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.680
When Anne placed that book
in Henry's hand,

22:32.760 --> 22:35.840
she handed him
all of the justification he needed

22:35.920 --> 22:40.720
to break with Rome
and to set up his own church in England.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.040
This really sent shockwaves
across the world.

22:44.120 --> 22:47.600
This is one of the most important moments,
not just in Henry's reign,

22:47.680 --> 22:50.480
but in the entire history of England,

22:50.560 --> 22:52.880
and it's all because of Anne!

22:52.960 --> 22:56.560
And this really marks
the end of Wolsey's career.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.400
He's failed to deliver an annulment.

22:59.480 --> 23:04.360
He's sent away in disgrace from court
and then is arrested,

23:04.440 --> 23:07.640
but he dies
on his way to the Tower of London.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.680
Didn't realize you were joining us.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.640
I heard that Henry's finally sent
Katherine to live at Windsor.

23:29.640 --> 23:32.440
Thomas Cromwell,
Henry's new right-hand man.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.960
A much nicer version of Wolsey.
Gentle eyes, strong principles.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.240
Thomas Cromwell
is a commoner.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.040
He's the son of a blacksmith,

23:40.120 --> 23:44.440
but he's also one of
the most brilliant minds of the Tudor age.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.440
He's a very skilled lawyer,

23:46.520 --> 23:48.720
and he's a religious reformer,

23:48.800 --> 23:51.720
so he has an awful lot
in common with Anne.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.400
Well, I guess Henry
can do whatever he wants

23:57.480 --> 24:00.720
now he's made himself
Supreme Head of the Church!

24:00.800 --> 24:03.280
Do I sense a coronation coming on?

24:04.040 --> 24:05.480
Hold your horses, Georgie boy.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.120
What is it?

24:16.200 --> 24:19.120
I didn't realize
Katherine was such a skilled artist.

24:22.160 --> 24:26.680
How do we know it's from Katherine?
Could be anyone. Maybe it's an omen.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.160
Don't be dramatic.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.480
Look, forget it.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.880
When a woman as glorious as Anne
is on her way to the top,

24:34.480 --> 24:35.640
haters are gonna hate.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.240
It's nothing more than a silly joke.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.120
Anne is already
making enemies left, right, and center.

24:45.200 --> 24:48.440
People love Katherine, the true Queen,

24:48.520 --> 24:54.920
and now Anne is steering the King
down this radical religious course.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.360
There are threats to her life.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.680
It was just a note.

24:59.360 --> 25:03.480
The court of public opinion
had very mixed views about what went on.

25:03.560 --> 25:06.680
Some were Team Katherine,
others were Team Anne.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.360
It was a nest of vipers.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.800
Henry's "doing" romance.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.160
It's not another dead animal, is it?

25:44.640 --> 25:45.600
Do you like it?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.920
It's perfect for our wedding night.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.320
Go on.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.600
Give me a preview.

27:19.520 --> 27:23.000
Anne. You know how I feel about you.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.080
I know,

27:24.680 --> 27:28.360
but, Henry,
we can't have this conversation again.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.600
We can be pretty sure that Anne and Henry

27:30.680 --> 27:33.880
didn't have full-on penetrative sex
in these years,

27:33.960 --> 27:36.800
because there was
just no reliable contraception,

27:36.880 --> 27:41.080
but I'm pretty sure
that… they're doing everything but.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.560
-We will be married.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.120
It's only a matter of time.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.160
I just need to tidy up a few loose ends,
that's all.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.760
We still need to get
our European friends on side.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.000
Why don't we take a trip to France?

28:04.680 --> 28:06.160
That's a great idea.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.920
Henry has really isolated himself
from Catholic Europe,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.640
and if he's going to make Anne his Queen,

28:17.720 --> 28:21.440
he really needs the support
of at least one European king.

28:21.520 --> 28:25.280
They think, given that Francis,
the King of France, knows Anne,

28:25.360 --> 28:28.120
maybe he'll put
his kind of stamp of authority

28:28.200 --> 28:29.200
on the marriage.

28:29.280 --> 28:32.760
For Anne, there's so much
riding on this trip to France.

28:32.840 --> 28:36.400
This is going to be
her first public outing with Henry.

28:36.480 --> 28:40.440
They are an item, and this is the point
where it becomes public.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.080
What if I can't pick Francis out?

29:05.160 --> 29:08.360
Come now.
No mask is big enough to hide that nose.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.200
You're so competitive.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.120
We're here to make the King of France
our new best friend

29:14.200 --> 29:17.200
on the strict understanding
that I'm the better man.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.400
I would never assume otherwise.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.440
You go work your magic.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.440
Henry's brought along his bit on the side!

30:21.320 --> 30:22.840
Anne Boleyn!

30:23.760 --> 30:25.160
<i>Quelle surprise!</i>

30:27.880 --> 30:30.200
I hope your sister is well?

30:32.000 --> 30:36.440
Your Majesty, King Henry and I have
a matter we'd like to discuss.

30:36.520 --> 30:37.360
Mm-hmm.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.920
And it shan't involve wrestling this time.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.800
Find me, uh… later.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.080
We'll, uh… talk.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.760
The buffet's calling! I'm starving!

31:00.400 --> 31:02.880
Anne is very excited to go back to France.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.920
France has been such a part
of her formation.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.040
Anne wants to see her friend Marguerite,

31:09.120 --> 31:11.800
who she writes to so affectionately.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.120
Are you looking for someone?

31:22.720 --> 31:25.840
Marguerite? King Francis's sister.
We're old friends.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.240
Didn't you know she's not coming?

31:28.840 --> 31:31.600
That's right. She's… …sick.

31:32.120 --> 31:33.280
Perhaps

31:34.400 --> 31:35.840
she's allergic to whores.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.960
Never let them see you cry.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.720
Is this is supposed to be a pep talk?

32:06.600 --> 32:08.320
I'm the son of a blacksmith.

32:09.160 --> 32:12.560
There's not a single person in this room
who thinks I belong here.

32:13.360 --> 32:16.600
Look, Anne, when they beat you down…

32:17.880 --> 32:19.440
You remember who you are.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.040
Hey, come on.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.640
Thanks to your charm and my wit,

32:48.240 --> 32:49.880
we now have Francis's blessing.

32:52.760 --> 32:56.280
Those brats wouldn't have dared
speak to you like that if I'd been there.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.920
It's fine.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.520
I can stand up for myself.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.160
It's okay.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.120
I've got you.

33:16.480 --> 33:17.720
When my father died,

33:19.240 --> 33:22.680
his advisors didn't think
I had it in me to rule England.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.920
But I've always believed
I was chosen by God to be King

33:27.000 --> 33:30.440
and that it is my duty
to live up to that if I can.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.680
But you believe in me.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.720
I believe in you.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.120
We can do this, Anne.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.240
Are you sure?

35:36.680 --> 35:39.040
You are one of a kind,
Anne Boleyn.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.400
What's wrong?

35:50.920 --> 35:53.520
Do you think
I could have got pregnant last night?

35:56.880 --> 35:58.400
There's a lovely thought.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.160
Henry, I'm serious!

36:01.240 --> 36:02.880
I am being serious.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.800
Screw Rome.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.000
France is on our side.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.240
No more waiting.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.080
Let's get married now.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.000
I want you, Anne.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.200
I want you every day by my side

36:24.040 --> 36:25.120
as my wife.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.440
I love you.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.520
I love you too.

36:48.160 --> 36:53.520
Henry and Anne marry privately
in 1532 at Dover.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.240
It's not only private, but secret.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.720
Anne was a relatively unknown woman,

37:03.800 --> 37:08.160
but she was plucked from obscurity
to marry the King of England,

37:08.240 --> 37:10.840
who fell head over heels in love with her.

37:10.920 --> 37:15.120
This is what she has fought for
for seven long years,

37:15.200 --> 37:18.600
and she's determined to enjoy her moment.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.440
Henry does it for Anne,

37:28.520 --> 37:30.000
because he loves her,

37:30.080 --> 37:34.800
but also because he desperately wants
a male heir.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.800
Henry and Anne believe
that their marriage is legitimate,

37:41.880 --> 37:43.720
but he's married to Katherine of Aragon.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.320
He's married to two queens,
and that makes him a bigamist.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.560
Everything all right?

37:58.120 --> 38:00.640
Just not hungry this morning.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.720
I feel a bit nauseous actually.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.720
Could you pass me
one of those apples, please?

38:08.080 --> 38:08.920
Thank you.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.360
You've hardly touched your food all week.
Are you sure you're okay?

38:13.440 --> 38:15.200
You want me to call a doctor?

38:15.280 --> 38:18.280
No need for that. I've never felt better.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.600
You're pregnant?

38:25.480 --> 38:26.800
At last!

38:26.880 --> 38:28.400
A son! A son!

38:28.480 --> 38:30.760
My astrologist said it would be a boy.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.080
I've waited so long, Anne!

38:40.240 --> 38:44.040
In 1532, Thomas Cranmer
is appointed Archbishop of Canterbury.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.320
He opens a very brief investigation

38:46.400 --> 38:48.760
into Henry's marriage
to Katherine of Aragon,

38:48.840 --> 38:50.040
declares it null and void,

38:50.120 --> 38:53.520
and declares Anne's marriage to Henry
is legitimate.

38:54.600 --> 38:59.200
Anne is about to experience
the most extraordinary moment of her life.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.200
Her coronation.

39:00.280 --> 39:05.960
Everyone in London
is required to put up pageants and banners

39:06.040 --> 39:10.800
and to glorify Anne,
essentially to worship her.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.160
It's a four-day-long celebration,

39:13.240 --> 39:17.280
and at its heart,
the center of attention, is Anne.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.880
When the crown touches her head,

39:19.960 --> 39:21.800
she has done it. She is Queen.

39:23.880 --> 39:26.800
I'm desperate to pee again.
Is that normal?

39:26.880 --> 39:30.280
Pressure's on your bladder,
and if this little boy has daddy's calves,

39:30.360 --> 39:34.040
you must really be holding it in!
Smile through the pain.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.400
There she is!

39:37.240 --> 39:39.000
You're looking regal, sis!

39:39.080 --> 39:40.640
That was amazing!

39:40.720 --> 39:44.160
I can't believe
my sister-in-law is the Queen of England!

39:44.240 --> 39:47.760
Who would have thought?
A Boleyn on the English throne!

39:47.840 --> 39:49.520
Aw.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.760
Mmm.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.840
Okay. Somebody take Daddy Boleyn away

39:53.920 --> 39:57.480
before he gets proud dad tears
all over my coronation dress.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.240
My Queen!

40:04.680 --> 40:07.200
And the future King of England.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.880
This is the stuff
of which fairy tales are made.

40:14.960 --> 40:20.040
All Anne has to do now
is give birth to a healthy boy,

40:20.120 --> 40:23.320
and her fairy tale
will have a happy ending.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.280
Dahh!

40:37.360 --> 40:40.480
You're okay! You've got this, okay?

40:40.560 --> 40:43.720
Now, come on, breathe with me.

40:43.800 --> 40:44.960
Okay.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.880
I can't… I can't do it.
I'm too tired! I can't!

40:49.960 --> 40:52.400
Anne, look at me. Yeah?

40:52.480 --> 40:53.600
The next King of England

40:53.680 --> 40:57.880
is making his entrance
into this world right now, okay?

40:57.960 --> 41:00.720
Everything you've ever dreamed of,
it's finally happening.

41:01.240 --> 41:05.360
But I need you to focus.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.360
For Anne, it now all hangs in the balance.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.480
She knew that a daughter was not enough.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.920
In this day and age, it seems incredible

41:26.000 --> 41:32.080
that Anne's entire fate
rests upon producing a boy, not a girl.

41:32.160 --> 41:36.680
The only way
that Anne could be absolutely secure…

41:37.720 --> 41:42.720
…is to deliver the boy
that Henry needed to be his next King.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.840
Is there something wrong with him?
