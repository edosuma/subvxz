WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:06.267
So, how are things in school?Awful.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.008
I've got this big report
that's due tomorrow.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.487
They only gave you a day?

00:09.531 --> 00:11.446
Well, they gave me two weeks.
I gave me a day.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.883
What's the assignment?

00:13.926 --> 00:15.972
Interview someone from my real
life I find interesting.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.757
Oh, yeah. I had to do that
when I was your age.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.064
You don't happen to have it
lying around, do you?

00:21.108 --> 00:24.676
I don't think a report
on Miley Cyrus

00:24.720 --> 00:26.330
is what your teacher's
looking for.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.636
You knew Miley Cyrus?

00:27.679 --> 00:29.986
Nope. That's why I got a "D."

00:30.030 --> 00:32.336
Well, you're in luck,
Hazelnut.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.816
I got lots of stories.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.557
Who says Hazel's gonna
pick you?

00:35.600 --> 00:36.775
Why not me?

00:36.819 --> 00:38.038
I'm a successful
business owner.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.387
Ah, yes, yes.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.128
Your grandfather would be
a perfect choice.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.390
Very interesting man.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.739
Not that it matters,

00:43.782 --> 00:46.307
but I am also
an accomplished businessman.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.483
Did you know I sold
more green onions

00:48.526 --> 00:50.572
than any other six-year-old
in Kabul?

00:50.615 --> 00:53.227
We all know. Every time we eat
something with onions in it,

00:53.270 --> 00:55.011
you tell us that story.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.969
It's a good story.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.668
Here's an idea.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.626
Why don't you write
about your war hero dad?

01:01.670 --> 01:04.368
Giving you a bad grade
would be unpatriotic.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.022
Another great choice.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.980
Your father is very brave.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.070
I should know.
He fought alongside me.

01:10.113 --> 01:13.377
Uncle Al, would you like me
to do the report on you?

01:13.421 --> 01:15.858
Oh, Hazel Jaan, there are
so many good choices

01:15.901 --> 01:17.120
around this table.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.165
Well, I guess I could do it...

01:18.208 --> 01:19.427
I humbly accept.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.473
If a little girl wants
to get an "A" on a paper,

01:22.517 --> 01:23.779
who am I to stop her?

01:25.998 --> 01:27.696
♪

01:27.739 --> 01:29.785
♪ Oh!

01:38.489 --> 01:42.363
My name is Awalmir Karimi,
son of Siddiq Karimi,

01:42.406 --> 01:44.495
grandson of Usman Karimi.

01:44.539 --> 01:47.672
A native of Kandahar currently
living just outside

01:47.716 --> 01:49.239
of Columbus, Ohio,

01:49.283 --> 01:51.154
in the second house
from the right,

01:51.198 --> 01:54.853
beside the pink house
with the messy lawn.

01:54.897 --> 01:58.640
And the story of how I got
from Afghanistan to America

01:58.683 --> 02:00.990
is filled with twists, turns,

02:01.033 --> 02:04.515
and-- dare I say-- miracles.

02:04.559 --> 02:08.780
Great. If I talk slow,
that might be all I need.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.392
Our story begins
on a warm summer day,

02:11.435 --> 02:13.742
when the mulberries
had just turned red.

02:13.785 --> 02:16.484
Write down that
he's afraid of owls.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.616
I'm not afraid of owls,

02:18.660 --> 02:21.228
I just know that they are
harbingers of death.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.186
They used to hoot in his ear
while he was sleeping.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.622
Stop trying to get
into my report.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.496
Uh, what advice would you
give yourself at age 11?

02:28.539 --> 02:30.802
Easy. Don't waste time
with the neighbor's daughter.

02:30.846 --> 02:34.284
She is not into you.
She's into your brother.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.243
What do you consider
your greatest accomplishment?

02:36.286 --> 02:38.854
Surviving.What do you mean?

02:38.897 --> 02:41.422
I lived through three wars
with barely a scratch.

02:41.465 --> 02:44.294
Ooh, this guy's got
a sixth sense for danger.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.253
One time we were talking
to this local farmer.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.472
Seemed like the nicest guy.
He was joking around with us.

02:48.516 --> 02:52.172
Then Al noticed an antenna
poking out of his pocket.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.912
He was hiding a walkie-talkie.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.566
Al warned us. We all got
the hell out of there

02:55.610 --> 02:57.133
before he could
call in an attack.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.221
Whoa.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.049
RILEY [sighs]:I know.

03:00.092 --> 03:03.095
It was amazing.
Nothing got past him.

03:04.575 --> 03:05.533
Hazel.

03:05.576 --> 03:08.536
I don't hear typing.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.366
The president was so impressed,
he almost named

03:12.409 --> 03:13.715
an American base after me.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.238
What? That is not true.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.761
You don't need to exaggerate.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.720
It is called the art
of storytelling, Riley.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.591
The details are not
as important

03:20.635 --> 03:22.941
as the feeling we are trying to
inspire in these young dreamers.

03:22.985 --> 03:26.380
Sure. Sure.
Mm-hmm.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.990
Where do you think
you'll be in five years?

03:28.033 --> 03:30.906
Probably still sitting here,
telling his story.

03:32.124 --> 03:35.084
So, would you say you're
afraid of all owls?

03:38.392 --> 03:41.046
And Al is smart.
He speaks five languages:

03:41.090 --> 03:44.398
English, Dari, Urdu,
Pashto and French.

03:44.441 --> 03:47.139
He is brave. He spent six years
serving with the Marines

03:47.183 --> 03:50.447
and saved many American lives,
including my dad's.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.014
And he is modest.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.363
They really wanted to
name a base after him,

03:53.407 --> 03:54.495
but he thought
it'd be too much work

03:54.538 --> 03:56.932
to change it on all the maps.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.281
The end.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.456
Wonderful.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.241
Are there any questions
for Hazel?

04:01.284 --> 04:03.939
What's his favorite thing
about America?

04:03.982 --> 04:06.420
Me.

04:06.463 --> 04:09.510
Also Costco and game shows.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.036
If he's so brave, why didn't
he stay in Afghanistan?

04:14.079 --> 04:15.820
Because the Taliban
was trying to kill him

04:15.864 --> 04:16.908
for helping us.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.955
Okay. Thank you, Hazel.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.913
Your uncle sounds
like a real hero.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.654
He is. And I know it's
really important to him

04:23.698 --> 04:25.090
that I get a good grade.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.921
Is Al short for al-Qaeda?

04:34.317 --> 04:35.492
You're kidding.

04:35.536 --> 04:38.321
Aw, man, okay.
I'll be right there.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.975
Is everything okay?

04:40.018 --> 04:41.542
We got to meet Vanessa
at school.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.283
Hazel punched a kid.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.763
What? Why would she do that?

04:45.807 --> 04:48.113
I don't know.
She was a biter in preschool.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.463
But who wasn't?

04:51.943 --> 04:54.206
The rules are
very clearly stated

04:54.250 --> 04:55.512
in the student handbook.

04:55.556 --> 04:58.646
What's going on?She's suspended.

04:58.689 --> 05:01.344
She punched a kid,
and now she's suspended.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.868
We have a zero-tolerance policy
for violence.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.348
Danny has a black eye.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.437
What were you thinking?

05:07.481 --> 05:08.699
It's his fault.
He was being a jerk.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.527
He called Uncle Al
a terrorist.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.747
Oh, Hazel Jaan,
I have been called

05:12.790 --> 05:14.357
much worse than that.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.054
One of the things about
speaking five languages

05:16.098 --> 05:17.926
is I've been called terrible
things in five languages.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.537
That doesn't make it okay
for some twerp

05:20.581 --> 05:22.060
to say it to my daughter.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.019
Is this Danny kid suspended,
too?

05:24.062 --> 05:26.108
We are handling that
separately.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.850
Great. Will you be
suspending him separately?

05:28.893 --> 05:31.200
We are not here
to discuss Danny.

05:31.243 --> 05:32.984
Hazel, I'll see you
in one week.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.725
I hope you learned
a lesson.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.640
Oh, we'll make sure
she does.

05:36.684 --> 05:37.989
Come on, we're going
to go apologize

05:38.033 --> 05:39.295
to that boy right now.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.905
She can apologize
when he does.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.908
Or maybe they do it
at the same time.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.562
I'm not in charge of Danny,

05:45.606 --> 05:47.869
but I'm in charge of Hazel,
and she needs to be punished.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.610
She is being punished.
She's suspended.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.176
Wait, what does it mean
that she is suspended?

05:51.220 --> 05:52.482
She's not allowed
to go to school.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.702
That is a punishment here?
Interesting.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.704
Thank you, Mrs. Ro.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.401
And you are grounded.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.969
No screens, no friends, no fun.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.274
Says who?

06:02.318 --> 06:03.580
Her mother.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.669
I'm her dad.
Don't I get a say?

06:05.713 --> 06:08.542
[quietly]:
Okay... what are you doing?

06:08.585 --> 06:09.978
Maybe I don't want
to ground her

06:10.021 --> 06:11.196
for something I would
have done, too.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.328
Okay, then,
what do you want to do?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.895
I'll talk to her.
That's it?

06:13.938 --> 06:15.418
That's not good enough.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.551
Well, it's my night.
Come on, Hazel, let's go.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.291
I'm gonna punish
you with pizza.

06:20.597 --> 06:21.990
Are you kidding me?

06:22.033 --> 06:24.296
I will speak to him.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.211
I'm so sorry about this.It's a shame.

06:26.255 --> 06:30.215
Because until that incident,
it was a wonderful report.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.695
They almost named a base
after you?

06:31.739 --> 06:33.871
Oh, good, that made it in.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.578
How's it coming?

06:44.621 --> 06:47.885
It's coming.
It's, uh, definitely coming.

06:47.929 --> 06:51.236
Dad, you're so good
at so many things.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.369
It's okay if you don't know
how to fix a dishwasher.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.631
I didn't know how
to fix a roof

06:54.675 --> 06:56.111
until I got up there
and did it.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.460
You fell off the roof.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.984
Learned a lot.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.248
Hey, what are you doing
home so early?

07:03.292 --> 07:04.598
I got suspended.

07:04.641 --> 07:07.339
Relax, I'm handling it.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.472
I disagree he's handling it,
but don't worry,

07:09.516 --> 07:12.301
I'm handling it.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.870
Riley,

07:15.913 --> 07:17.480
I think we need to have
a talk about your parenting.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.873
No, we don't.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.352
I agree, Dad.
You're killing it.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.616
I'm gonna go ride my bike.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.923
Have fun.
Make good choices.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.623
When it comes to Hazel,

07:29.666 --> 07:31.973
you and Vanessa must
speak with one voice.

07:32.016 --> 07:35.063
Yeah, one voice sounds great.
I choose mine.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.934
You are disrespecting
her mother.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.936
Vanessa's wrong.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.503
Hazel had your back.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.983
She stood up for what
she thought was right,

07:42.026 --> 07:44.072
which happens to be
what I think is right.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.726
That's all good dad stuff.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.119
But you are confusing her.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.991
She cannot be punished
at her mother's house

07:50.034 --> 07:51.558
and pampered here.

07:51.601 --> 07:54.125
And what makes you
such an expert on children?

07:54.169 --> 07:56.867
I share a room with one... you.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.391
You are the child.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.138
That guy's way too young
to be a staff sergeant.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.836
And look, his
insignia's upside down.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.533
Drives me crazy.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.057
He's been shooting for an hour,
he hasn't reloaded once.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.146
Why do you guys even watch
this movie?

08:15.190 --> 08:17.540
Oh, it's a classic.It's the best.
It's great.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.718
Hey.
Guys.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.677
Wow. Movies, brownies.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.548
Really bringing the pain,
aren't you, Riley?

08:25.592 --> 08:28.290
Hazel knows violence
is wrong. Right?

08:28.333 --> 08:30.858
That is not how you use
a bayonet.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.948
Okay. Well, playtime's over.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.732
We're going to Danny's
to apologize.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.473
I think I want to
stay here tonight.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.258
Oh, no, you're not.
Riley, tell her.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.043
It's okay with me
if she wants to stay here.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.958
Thanks, Dad.You're welcome, sweetheart.

08:44.001 --> 08:47.048
Oh, my God, grow up
and be a parent.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.789
I'm a better
parent than you.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.094
Uh-oh.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.356
[TV shuts off]

08:51.400 --> 08:53.707
Okay, okay,
let's put the pin

08:53.750 --> 08:55.230
back into the grenade
and talk it out.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.710
Hazel, go to the garage.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.712
Uh, she really shouldn't
be out there alone...

08:58.755 --> 09:01.105
Please, Mr. Art, you stay.
This is a family problem,

09:01.149 --> 09:03.151
and the family must
solve it together.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.022
Lizzie, we need you, too.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.676
Hazel, why are you still here?

09:06.720 --> 09:09.157
And no brownies.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.811
All the way.

09:10.854 --> 09:13.291
All the way,
and shut the door.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.685
[door shuts]What's going on?

09:15.729 --> 09:17.382
Lizzie, please sit.
Join us.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.167
This family is in crisis.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.125
[sputters]
What else is new?

09:21.169 --> 09:23.693
I would like to make
a suggestion.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.303
Back home, when there was
a problem,

09:25.347 --> 09:27.262
we'd hold a meeting
known as a jirga.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.917
What's that? It is where allmembers of the family gather

09:29.960 --> 09:31.135
to express opinions

09:31.179 --> 09:32.789
and offer solutions.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.835
Oh, an intervention.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.577
Okay, cool. I've been
on both sides of those.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.367
Respected members
of the jirga,

09:45.410 --> 09:47.412
we are here to help Hazel.

09:47.456 --> 09:51.286
God is watching us and
expects nothing but honesty.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.635
That's a lot of pressure.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.332
AL:I think

09:54.376 --> 09:56.291
we all agree that Hazel
cannot have one set of rules

09:56.334 --> 09:58.467
at her mother's house
and another set of rules

09:58.510 --> 09:59.816
at her father's.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.644
You mean norules
at her father's

10:01.688 --> 10:02.906
and rules at mine?

10:02.950 --> 10:04.342
I have rules.AL: The point is,

10:04.386 --> 10:06.649
we agree it's a problem, yes?

10:06.693 --> 10:08.782
Yes.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.480
Now, who wants
to share their wisdom

10:11.523 --> 10:13.438
with this poor couple?

10:19.662 --> 10:23.231
We all know the Browns game
starts soon, right?

10:26.408 --> 10:28.149
All right, I'll start.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.672
Thank you.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.893
Thank you for including me
in this important, uh...

10:32.936 --> 10:34.895
I forgot the word already.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.375
Jirga.Jirga.

10:37.419 --> 10:40.596
Anyway, I think that these
are two terrific parents

10:40.640 --> 10:42.598
who love their daughter
differently

10:42.642 --> 10:44.905
but in the same way.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.038
Why does Freddy get a say?

10:48.082 --> 10:50.084
I'm not sure
he's saying anything.

10:51.085 --> 10:54.915
All right, you guys have
got to get it together,

10:54.958 --> 10:57.221
'cause this is a mess,
and she's only 12.

10:57.265 --> 11:00.224
It's going to get worse.
That's basic biology.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.139
Thank you, Lizzie.
That is a very good point.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.446
And this one knows what
she's talking about.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.841
She was a beast
from, like, 13 to 30.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.277
I am 27.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.019
Well,
30 can't get here quick enough.

11:12.062 --> 11:15.457
Is this 'cause I want to call
someone to fix the dishwasher?

11:15.500 --> 11:18.765
A repairman is a thief
with a wrench instead of a gun.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.593
Okay, show of hands,

11:21.637 --> 11:24.771
who thinks Dad has no idea
how to fix the dishwasher?

11:25.902 --> 11:28.644
You're gonna eat
those words.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.820
Yeah, well, I'm gonna eat 'em
off a paper plate!

11:30.864 --> 11:32.387
AL:
Okay,

11:32.430 --> 11:34.128
I understand
this is everyone's first jirga,

11:34.171 --> 11:36.043
and it is easy to be tempted

11:36.086 --> 11:38.045
to talk
about very unrelated things,

11:38.088 --> 11:40.047
but we are here to talk
about Hazel.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.005
Why is everyone acting
like I don't punish her?

11:42.049 --> 11:43.877
I punish her all the time.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.140
Do you hear that?
This is pointless.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.445
Trust the process.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.752
There comes a time
in every jirga

11:49.796 --> 11:51.754
where someone says,
"This is pointless."

11:51.798 --> 11:53.930
Yes, it is earlier
than I thought,

11:53.974 --> 11:55.976
but that means it is working.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.021
It doesn't matter
what anyone else thinks

11:58.065 --> 11:59.414
'cause Riley
holds all the cards.

11:59.457 --> 12:00.763
No, I don't.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.373
She worships you.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.767
She wants to be a Marine
because of you.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.595
She craves your approval,

12:06.638 --> 12:09.337
and when we disagree,
you're gonna win.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.252
So, it's my fault
she looks up to me?

12:11.295 --> 12:13.254
No, it's not your fault.
It's just the truth,

12:13.297 --> 12:15.430
and it's not fair.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.786
Silence is also a natural part
of this process.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.223
It does not reflect poorly
on the jirga.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.705
Great word.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.667
[door opens]

12:36.668 --> 12:40.585
They still fighting?Yep.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.023
What are you doing in here?

12:43.066 --> 12:45.112
Fixing the dishwasher.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.811
Do you think
I did the wrong thing,

12:48.855 --> 12:50.291
punching that kid?

12:51.292 --> 12:52.859
Okay, I'll tell you,

12:52.902 --> 12:54.556
but you have to promise
to keep it to yourself.

12:54.599 --> 12:55.949
Promise.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.823
I punched a lot of kids
for dumber reasons than that.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.390
Like what?

13:02.433 --> 13:04.348
In... a long time ago,

13:04.392 --> 13:07.656
a friend of mine got
the first Led Zeppelin album.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.179
I heard it was great.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.442
So I begged him
to let me borrow it,

13:11.486 --> 13:14.750
and I played it all night,
scratched it up good.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.013
So I punched him.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.060
That makes no sense.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.409
Yeah. I didn't say,
"You want to hear

13:21.452 --> 13:23.541
something smart I once did,"
did I?

13:23.585 --> 13:25.065
I'll tell you this much.

13:25.108 --> 13:27.458
I never would've sassed my mom
the way you did.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.069
That would not have flown.

13:30.113 --> 13:33.073
Maybe I should go in there?Nah.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.770
They're having a conversation
they need to have.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.033
It's a little about you.
It's a lot about them.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.775
I wish I could
do something.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.690
Well, some things,
you can't fix.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.780
People. Dishwashers.
All sorts of things.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.914
Now scram.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.698
I don't like people watching me
while I work.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.845
What?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.239
I'm sorry I punched you
in the face, okay?

14:09.283 --> 14:11.067
Who told you to say that?

14:11.111 --> 14:12.286
Everyone.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.114
But I do mean it.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.116
Thanks.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.813
You're welcome.

14:20.424 --> 14:24.167
Hey, just so you know,
it was a crummy thing you said.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.690
Truth hurts.

14:25.734 --> 14:26.996
What's that?

14:27.040 --> 14:29.129
You know
the last thing America needs?

14:29.172 --> 14:30.565
No.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.785
Tell me.

14:39.182 --> 14:42.011
I think the problem
with this particular jirga

14:42.055 --> 14:45.841
is that our elder is
in the kitchen drinking.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.539
Would it help
if we all held hands?

14:48.583 --> 14:51.194
Stop asking that.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.373
Hey. Did you get a call
from Danny's mom?

14:56.417 --> 14:57.635
No.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.073
You're about to.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.510
You were supposed to be
in the garage.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.729
I punched Danny again.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.341
Hazel, what the hell? See, thisis because of you.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.908
I-I went over and apologized,

15:08.951 --> 15:10.822
and he was even more
of a jerk, and...

15:10.866 --> 15:12.302
Well, you're all caught up.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.698
I know I'm grounded forever
and you guys are gonna fight,

15:16.741 --> 15:19.396
so I'll just be in the garage
not watching TV.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.747
So, now do you think
this is a problem?

15:22.791 --> 15:24.097
Yeah.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.751
I don't want to be that guy,

15:26.795 --> 15:28.797
but I feel
like we should've held hands.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.453
All right, talk.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.890
I tried. I really,
really tried.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.239
What happened?

15:36.283 --> 15:37.937
Well, you guys
were fighting so much,

15:37.980 --> 15:39.460
I thought if I did
what you wanted, it would stop.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.201
Then Danny said
a bunch of stuff,

15:41.244 --> 15:42.854
and, I don't know,
everything went blank,

15:42.898 --> 15:45.118
and the next thing I knew,
he was on the ground.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.554
Blank? Really?

15:46.597 --> 15:47.772
Can I?

15:47.816 --> 15:49.905
[sighs]
Sure.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.128
Did you think
you were gonna punch him,

15:55.171 --> 15:56.956
or did you just do it?

15:56.999 --> 15:59.349
I just did it. I wasn't
thinking about anything.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.223
I get it.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.573
Sometimes when I get mad,

16:05.616 --> 16:09.620
it feels like a switch flips
and I'm not in charge anymore.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.797
What do you do
when that happens?

16:12.841 --> 16:15.539
Stupid stuff
I always wish I hadn't done.

16:17.846 --> 16:21.023
I was lucky when your mom and I
were together.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.591
She'd talk me down.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.813
Remember when you kicked me
so I wouldn't punch that guy?

16:28.857 --> 16:30.990
Which time?

16:34.036 --> 16:36.952
She can help you
like she helped me.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.003
And we're still a family.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.137
We got to have one set of rules.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.965
So, if I stay here,
I'm grounded?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.185
Way grounded.
Way worse than your mom's.

16:52.228 --> 16:55.623
The same as at Mom's.The same as at Mom's.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.453
And the next time
you start feeling

16:59.496 --> 17:01.020
like you're gonna lose it,

17:01.063 --> 17:02.978
you call one of us.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.068
Okay.Okay.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.462
So, does that mean
I get an iPhone?

17:09.463 --> 17:12.118
I mean... No.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.431
All right, that should do it.
[dishwasher beeps]

17:21.475 --> 17:23.868
And...

17:26.567 --> 17:28.569
It's quieter than I remember.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.486
Do you give up?Nope.

17:32.529 --> 17:35.184
I've never called a repairman,
and I never will.

17:35.228 --> 17:39.623
However, I will be out
for the rest of the day.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.408
Got errands to do,
people to see.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.410
Definitely enough
to keep me busy

17:43.453 --> 17:47.196
between the hours
of 11:00 and 4:00.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.763
Okay.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.679
I will know
not to expect you home

17:51.722 --> 17:53.942
during that five-hour window.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.291
Yep. See you at 4:00

17:55.335 --> 17:57.119
or whenever you call
and say you miss me.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.165
And your credit card if
I need it for any reason?

17:59.208 --> 18:03.386
On the counter
if you need it for any reason.
