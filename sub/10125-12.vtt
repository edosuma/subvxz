00:09.867 --> 00:13.400
[WOMAN]
<i>OH, TREVOR, </i>
<i>TAKE ME WITH YOU. </i>

00:13.400 --> 00:15.700
TAKE HER, TREVOR!
TAKE HER!

00:15.700 --> 00:17.000
NO! NO, HE CAN'T!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.500
<i>NO! NO, I CAN'T! </i>

00:18.500 --> 00:20.400
<i>THE WORLD </i>
<i>OF THE SUBMARINE </i>

00:20.400 --> 00:23.300
<i>IS FAR TOO DANGEROUS </i>
<i>FOR A WOMAN. </i>

00:23.300 --> 00:24.467
<i>I DON'T CARE. </i>

00:24.467 --> 00:28.567
<i>I DON'T HAVE TO BE ALIVE </i>
<i>TO LOVE YOU. </i>

00:28.567 --> 00:30.967
OH, THAT-THAT'S
BEAUTIFUL.

00:30.967 --> 00:35.367
SEE, CORY? WASN'T
THAT A GOOD MOVIE?

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
CORY!

00:38.200 --> 00:39.767
YOU'RE DROOLING.

00:40.834 --> 00:43.667
NO. NO, I--I WAS CRYING.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.100
THROUGH MY MOUTH.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.967
IF YOU'RE BORED, GO WATCH
THE GAME WITH YOUR FATHER.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.767
HON, ANYONE CAN WATCH
A SUPER BOWL, RIGHT?

00:50.767 --> 00:54.400
IT TAKES A SPECIAL MAN
TO WATCH A CLASSIC
LIKE THIS.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.100
IS THAT WHAT
YOU ARE, COR,
A SPECIAL MAN?

00:58.100 --> 00:59.400
HUH?

00:59.400 --> 01:00.867
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:00.867 --> 01:03.100
I'M SAVING A LIFE!

01:04.400 --> 01:07.100
YOU AND TOPANGA HAVE SPENT
THE LAST THREE FRIDAY NIGHTS

01:07.100 --> 01:09.233
AT HOME, TEARING UP
AT CHICK FLICKS!

01:09.233 --> 01:11.000
LAST FRIDAY NIGHT,
IF YOU RECALL,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.867
TOPANGA AND I SPENT
A LOVELY EVENING
AT HOME

01:13.867 --> 01:15.300
WATCHING NO TV
WHATSOEVER.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.100
YOU MADE JAM!

01:17.100 --> 01:20.767
IT WAS PRESERVES, ERIC.
IT WAS PRESERVES.

01:20.767 --> 01:22.467
THERE WAS A NIFTY
LITTLE RECIPE

01:22.467 --> 01:24.000
IN THIS <i>COUPLES </i>MAGAZINE.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.967
I SAID I WAS MARRIED
TO GET A SUBSCRIPTION
DISCOUNT.

01:27.967 --> 01:30.900
ARE YOU BLIND
IN THE EYES, MAN?

01:30.900 --> 01:34.600
YOU AND TOPANGA ARE TURNING
INTO AN OLD, BORING COUPLE.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.800
TOPANGA AND I
HAVE BEEN GOING OUT
FOR FIVE MONTHS.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.233
IN OUR CIRCLE,
WE'RE CONSIDERED
YOUNG AND HIP.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.100
[TOPANGA]
HON! HOW ARE
THE MUFFINS DOING?

01:43.100 --> 01:45.467
I'LL STICK A FORK
IN 'EM, HON!

01:45.467 --> 01:49.834
GO NEAR THAT OVEN,
AND I'LL STICK A FORK
IN YOU.

01:49.834 --> 01:50.900
YOU WOULDN'T.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.734
I'D BE DOING YOU
A FAVOR.

01:52.734 --> 01:55.500
STOP BEING
SUCH A WISENHEIMER.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.000
WHO SAID THAT?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.400
YOU DID, POPS.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.200
SHAWN! QUICK! TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR WEEKEND.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.834
A LOT OF DATES?

02:08.834 --> 02:10.800
WHO COUNTS?

02:10.800 --> 02:11.867
SIX.

02:11.867 --> 02:14.500
TELL ME ABOUT THEM,
EVERY SINGLE ONE,

02:14.500 --> 02:16.900
LIKE YOUR LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT.

02:16.900 --> 02:20.400
CORY, I'M NO ROCKET
SCIENTOLOGIST,
BUT, UH...

02:20.400 --> 02:22.300
I'M SENSING THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.033
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SOMETHING'S WRONG?

02:24.033 --> 02:27.400
DOES MY LIFE HAVE TO BE
IN A HORRIBLE, BORING RUT

02:27.400 --> 02:29.467
TO ASK HOW
YOUR WEEKEND WAS?

02:29.467 --> 02:31.367
THROW A BONE
TO YOUR BUDDY.

02:31.367 --> 02:35.200
NO! YOU DOUBLED
WITH YOUR FOLKS AGAIN.

02:36.233 --> 02:37.767
ONLY ON FRIDAY
AND SATURDAY.

02:37.767 --> 02:42.900
BUT SUNDAY IT WAS
JUST ME AND TOPANGA
AT THE MALL.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.500
YEP.
SHE BOUGHT ME SLACKS.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.834
OH, CORY, I THINK
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

02:51.834 --> 02:52.900
I THINK SO, TOO.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.767
BUT YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE IN LUCK

02:55.767 --> 02:56.834
'CAUSE, COME ON,

02:56.834 --> 03:00.200
WHAT AM I THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST EXPERT ON?

03:01.233 --> 03:03.567
REALLY NOT ANYTHING.

03:03.567 --> 03:06.000
O.K., BUT I DO KNOW
A LOT ABOUT LOVE,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.767
AND IT SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOU AND TOPANGA

03:08.767 --> 03:10.100
ARE IN A SLUMP.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.867
NO, WE'RE TERRIFIC,
SHAWN.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.467
IT'S JUST--IT'S ME.

03:13.467 --> 03:14.734
I'VE LOST MY EDGE.

03:14.734 --> 03:17.100
I'M NOT THE SAME OLD
DANGEROUS CORY.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.500
YEAH, THERE'S BEEN TALK.
REALLY?

03:19.500 --> 03:20.500
NO!

03:20.500 --> 03:21.834
LOOK, HERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.367
I GOT A SPECIAL
INVITE TONIGHT

03:24.367 --> 03:26.934
TO A DANCE
AT HAMILTON HIGH.

03:26.934 --> 03:28.834
WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH ME?

03:28.834 --> 03:31.300
WEAR YOUR NEW SLACKS.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.200
A PARTY
AT ANOTHER SCHOOL?

03:33.200 --> 03:36.400
THIS COULD BE
JUST WHAT I NEED.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.800
WAIT. I HAVE PLANS
WITH TOPANGA TONIGHT.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.200
TELL HER YOU NEED
A NIGHT OUT
WITH THE BOYS.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.967
THERE SHE IS.
TALK TO HER.

03:43.967 --> 03:46.734
O.K., BUT THIS IS NOT
GOING TO BE EASY.

03:46.734 --> 03:49.400
THE KEY IS TO BE
DIRECT AND VAGUE,

03:49.400 --> 03:52.100
YET OBVIOUS AND SUBTLE.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.800
MOST IMPORTANT,
I MUST STICK TO MY GUNS

03:53.800 --> 03:56.233
NO MATTER WHAT
SHE THROWS AT ME.

03:56.233 --> 03:57.600
HI, CORY.

03:58.734 --> 04:00.567
I CAN'T GO.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.133
CORY, ABOUT TONIGHT,
CAN WE RESCHEDULE?

04:03.133 --> 04:05.600
SOME OF THE GIRLS
ARE GETTING TOGETHER--

04:05.600 --> 04:07.233
OH, DON'T SPEAK.
DON'T SPEAK.

04:07.233 --> 04:08.834
IF YOU NEED
TO GET TOGETHER

04:08.834 --> 04:12.667
WITH THE GIRLS OF YOUR GENDER,
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

04:12.667 --> 04:15.667
CORY, HAVE YOU BEEN
READING <i>COUPLES </i>MAGAZINE?

04:15.667 --> 04:18.500
I TOOK THE QUIZ
IN THE BACK.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.500
95.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.100
OOH!

04:23.900 --> 04:24.934
95?

04:24.934 --> 04:28.867
IS THAT YOUR SCORE
OR YOUR AGE?

04:29.934 --> 04:30.934
YO, MATTHEWS,
WAIT UP.

04:30.934 --> 04:33.300
YOUR PAPER
ON <i>OF MICE AND MEN, </i>

04:33.300 --> 04:36.667
I GOT SOME SERIOUS
QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.033
LIKE, UH, WHERE IS IT?

04:39.033 --> 04:42.033
WELL, UM, I CAN'T FIND
THE BOOK ANYWHERE!

04:42.033 --> 04:45.233
I'VE BEEN TO EVERY
PET STORE IN THE CITY!

04:45.233 --> 04:49.233
I DID FIND THIS PAMPHLET
ON LAND TURTLES.

04:49.233 --> 04:51.133
I'LL DO YOU A FAVOR.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.400
I'LL LEND YOU
MY COPY.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.100
HEY,
HERE'S YOUR PAMPHLET.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.300
MATTHEWS, HOW'S
THE JOURNALISM PROJECT
GOING?

04:58.300 --> 04:59.767
IN WHAT?

04:59.767 --> 05:00.834
JOURNALISM.

05:00.834 --> 05:04.200
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ANALYZE
THE EVENING NEWS?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.500
THAT'S RIGHT. I DID.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.400
WALK WITH ME.
LET'S TALK.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.767
YOU WANT A PAPER,
TOO, DON'T YOU?

05:11.767 --> 05:12.867
AH, MR. MATTHEWS.

05:12.867 --> 05:15.600
VERY INTERESTING ESSAY
ON JOAN OF ARC.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.600
AH, FINALLY,
A LITTLE APPRECIATION.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.967
NOW, DID THAT HURT?

05:18.967 --> 05:21.500
BUT I DOUBT
IF ARC MEANT

05:21.500 --> 05:24.800
THAT JOAN WAS
FROM ARKANSAS.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.567
IT'S A THEORY.

05:26.567 --> 05:27.667
IT'S AN "F."

05:27.667 --> 05:30.834
WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS
JUST CUT ME SOME SLACK?

05:30.834 --> 05:32.600
MATTHEWS, I'LL CUT
YOU SOME SLACK.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.500
DON'T BOTHER SHOWING UP
TO CHEMISTRY ANYMORE.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.400
JUST BLOW UP
SOMETHING AT HOME
AND BRING IT IN.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.867
THANK YOU,
DR. SORRELL.

05:38.867 --> 05:40.767
YOU ARE A MAN
AMONG MEN.

05:40.767 --> 05:43.500
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE SERA-MIX.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
YOU MEAN CERAMICS?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.967
YEAH, THE ASHTRAY CLASS.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.900
YOU KNOW WHAT SCARES ME?

05:51.900 --> 05:57.000
HE'LL END UP
MAKING MORE MONEY
THAN ANY OF US.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.600
MOM, HOLD MY CALLS.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.600
TONIGHT I'M GOING
TO BE STUDYING.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.967
GREAT. LET ME
GET MY CAMERA.

06:05.967 --> 06:07.200
HEY, I'M SERIOUS.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.500
I GOT PENCILS,
I GOT A NOTEBOOK,
I GOT REFRESHMENT--

06:10.500 --> 06:12.967
EVERYTHING I NEED
TO BE A STUDYING FOOL.

06:12.967 --> 06:15.600
WHERE ARE YOUR BOOKS?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.934
ERIC, DID YOU LEAVE
THEM IN YOUR LOCKER?

06:18.934 --> 06:21.200
EITHER THERE
OR ON THE BUS.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.367
ERIC, YOU DON'T
TAKE THE BUS!

06:23.367 --> 06:26.100
WELL, THEN THEY'RE
SAFELY IN MY LOCKER.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.133
WHAT WOULD I DO
WITHOUT YOU, MOM?

06:29.133 --> 06:32.000
YOU'D STUDY
THE KITCHEN TABLE.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.200
HELP ME PICK OUT
SOMETHING FOR THE PARTY.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.300
SURE.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.000
O.K. WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THIS SHIRT?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
IT'S FINE.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.867
BUT DO YOU LIKE IT
BETTER THAN...THIS?

06:46.934 --> 06:49.400
EVERYTHING
YOU GOT HERE IS FINE.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.767
THEY'RE ALL VERY YOU.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.300
THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
SHAWN.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.200
EVERYTHING I OWN IS ME!

06:54.200 --> 06:56.300
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME
IS ME!

06:56.300 --> 07:00.066
AND ME, RIGHT NOW,
JUST AIN'T CUTTIN'
THE DIJON.

07:00.066 --> 07:01.700
CORY, MAYBE IT'S NOT YOU.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.400
IS EVERYTHING COOL
BETWEEN YOU AND TOPANGA?

07:04.400 --> 07:05.400
OH, YEAH.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.500
I LOVE HER.
SHE'S THE BEST.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.300
I-IT'S NOT TOPANGA.
IT'S ME.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.400
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY PROBLEM IS?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.967
SHOOT. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MY PROBLEM IS.

07:18.100 --> 07:21.100
CORY, LET'S JUST GO
TO THIS PARTY, O.K.?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.100
COME ON.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.000
BUT DRESSED LIKE THIS?
NO WAY.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.467
WEAR SOMETHING OF MINE.
A JACKET? A HAT?

07:26.467 --> 07:29.200
A JACKET. I'M VERY
PRONE TO HAT HEAD.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.834
SOMETIMES I GET IT
WITHOUT EVEN WEARING
A HAT.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.300
I'VE BEEN AT THIS GAME
LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.900
YOU CAN'T JUST SHOW UP
AND CHANGE THE RULES.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.567
GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN,
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

07:43.567 --> 07:44.967
A FRIENDLY
FACULTY MEETING.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.734
YOU CANNOT CHECK
AND RAISE, MAN.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.500
HE'S RIGHT.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.033
MATTHEWS, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

07:51.033 --> 07:53.033
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
AT FACULTY MEETINGS?

07:53.033 --> 07:54.867
JUST ON MONDAYS.
THIS IS OUR WEEKLY GAME.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.500
WE DON'T PLAY FOR MONEY.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.033
WE TALK, WE RELAX,
AND TRY TO FORGET

07:59.033 --> 08:00.734
THERE'S SUCH A THING
AS STUDENTS.

08:00.734 --> 08:04.400
YOU DON'T PLAY FOR MONEY?
EVEN YOU, DR. SORRELL?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.500
NO NEED TO.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.467
WITH FINALS
AROUND THE CORNER,

08:07.467 --> 08:11.467
I'M SURE TO HAVE
FRESH CASH ROLLING IN.

08:11.467 --> 08:13.600
CAN I JOIN YOU?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.700
NO.
NO.
NO.
NO.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.600
WHAT ARE WE, AFRAID OF
A LITTLE COMPETITION?

08:16.600 --> 08:17.600
TERRIFIED.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.600
NOW GO.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.800
I'LL MAKE A DEAL
WITH YOU GUYS.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.133
I'LL PLAY UNTIL I LOSE,

08:22.133 --> 08:23.900
THEN I'LL GO HOME
AND STUDY.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.100
AS TEACHERS, HOW DO YOU
ARGUE WITH THAT?

08:26.100 --> 08:29.667
HE NEEDS THE GRADES.
DEAL HIM IN.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.100
I GOT THREE KINGS!

08:31.100 --> 08:33.133
I HAD A FULL HOUSE!

08:33.133 --> 08:36.567
HI. I NEED TO SEE
YOUR HAMILTON HIGH
I.D. CARD?

08:36.567 --> 08:38.133
UH, WE GO
TO JOHN ADAMS.

08:38.133 --> 08:40.500
BUT IT SHOULD BE
ON THAT GUEST LIST.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.567
THE NAME?

08:41.567 --> 08:43.300
IT'S UNDER
SHAWN HUNTER.

08:43.300 --> 08:45.100
OH, WOW.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.133
SHAWN HUNTER?

08:46.133 --> 08:47.200
THAT'S RIGHT.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.400
WE HEARD YOU WERE COMING.
GO RIGHT ON IN.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.567
YOUR GUEST, TOO.

08:51.567 --> 08:54.500
I'M HILARY.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.467
YOU KNOW, I WON'T BE STUCK
AT THE DOOR ALL NIGHT.

08:58.467 --> 09:00.500
SAVE ME A DANCE...SHAWN?

09:00.500 --> 09:02.100
YOU BET HE WILL.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.200
RIGHT, SHAWN?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.667
WAIT. NO--

09:05.667 --> 09:07.700
SHAWN, THAT GIRL
THINKS I'M YOU.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.700
SO?

09:08.700 --> 09:10.567
WE GOT TO SET HER
STRAIGHT,

09:10.567 --> 09:12.133
OR WORD WILL SPREAD
THAT I'M SHAWN HUNTER.

09:12.133 --> 09:13.133
AGAIN, SO?

09:13.133 --> 09:16.834
WELL, IF PEOPLE
THINK I'M YOU...

09:21.200 --> 09:22.200
WOW.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.734
LET'S GO...SHAWN.

09:33.967 --> 09:37.233
O.K. AS FAR AS ANYBODY
AT THIS PARTY KNOWS,

09:37.233 --> 09:38.400
YOU ARE SHAWN HUNTER.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.600
ONE GIRL AT THE DOOR
THOUGHT I WAS YOU.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.000
THAT WAS IT.
JUST ONE GIRL.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.967
HI, SHAWN!

09:47.000 --> 09:48.033
UH, HI.

09:48.033 --> 09:50.300
SOMEBODY'S TALKING
TO YOU.

09:50.300 --> 09:54.200
OH...H-HI,
PRETTY GIRL.

09:54.200 --> 09:57.600
ONLY SHAWN HUNTER CAN
PULL OFF A LINE LIKE THAT.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.934
SO HOW DID IT
FEEL, SHAWN?

09:59.934 --> 10:02.667
ON ONE HAND,
I'M A LITTLE FLUSHED,

10:02.667 --> 10:04.400
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

10:04.400 --> 10:06.567
I NOTICE A LITTLE KICK
IN MY STEP.

10:06.567 --> 10:09.033
THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY EXCITING
ABOUT BEING YOU.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.867
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
MY MONDAY MORNING SMILE.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.200
BUT TONIGHT
IT'S ALL YOURS.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.600
TOMORROW YOU CAN
GO BACK TO BEING

10:14.600 --> 10:17.400
YOUR EVERYDAY,
LACKLUSTER, BORING--

10:17.400 --> 10:18.500

10:18.500 --> 10:21.467
GOOD. NOW, WHY DON'T
YOU GO CHECK OUT

10:21.467 --> 10:24.100
THOSE LITTLE LADIES
OVER THERE?

10:25.133 --> 10:28.500
OR, AS I MIGHT SAY,
BABES.

10:28.500 --> 10:33.467
THEY ARE
ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE
ALL THAT IS SHAWN.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.133
HEY!

10:39.133 --> 10:41.767
WHO ARE YOU DOING?

10:41.767 --> 10:42.767
YOU!

10:42.767 --> 10:45.900
NO, THAT WASN'T ME!
THAT WAS FONZIE!

10:45.900 --> 10:49.033
HUH. THIS IS TRICKIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.033
CORY, YOU'RE
TRYING TOO HARD.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.100
JUST RELAX
AND BE MYSELF.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.667
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

10:54.667 --> 10:56.734
DON'T DO ANYTHING.

10:56.734 --> 11:00.467
YOU MEAN THE KEY
TO BEING SHAWN HUNTER
IS DOING NOTHING?

11:00.467 --> 11:02.700
JUST BY SITTING
ON THIS TABLE

11:02.700 --> 11:03.867
WITH MY ARMS FOLDED,

11:03.867 --> 11:06.300
GIRLS ARE GOING
TO ASK ME TO DANCE?

11:06.300 --> 11:08.767
SHAWN, LET'S DANCE.

11:10.033 --> 11:12.600

11:28.200 --> 11:30.367
MATTHEWS,
I KNOW YOU'RE CHEATING.

11:30.367 --> 11:32.867

FIGURE OUT HOW.

11:32.867 --> 11:36.000
MR. WILLIAMS,
YOUR WORDS HAVE SOILED ME.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.133
WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS
JUST BELIEVE THAT
MAYBE ERIC MATTHEWS

11:39.133 --> 11:40.300
IS GOOD AT SOMETHING?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.867

MATTHEWS.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.300

11:46.000 --> 11:47.300
WELL, WE'LL TALK.

OUR SONG.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.734
SO HOW ARE YOU
DOING, SHAWN?

12:19.734 --> 12:22.200
THE REVIEWS ARE IN.
WE ARE A HIT!

12:22.200 --> 12:25.000
I KNOW! I SAW!
THREE GIRLS AT ONCE?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.500
IT'S NOT
JUST THE GIRLS.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.033
IT'S THE WAY
I'M FEELING TONIGHT.

12:28.033 --> 12:30.800
NOT KNOWING WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN--
IT'S SO EXCITING!

12:30.800 --> 12:33.133
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
BE YOU, BUDDY.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.500
YOU'RE BEING YOU.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.300
BUT EVERYONE THINKS
I'M SHAWN HUNTER.

12:37.300 --> 12:41.700
SURE, BUT YOU'RE
NOT DOING ANYTHING
CORY MATTHEWS WOULDN'T.

A PRETTY GOOD TIME.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.600
AND IT'S ABOUT
TO GET BETTER.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.867
WORD IS THERE'S A VERY
HOT FRENCH GIRL HERE

12:50.867 --> 12:53.033
WHO COMES FROM SOMEPLACE
IN EUROPE.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.033
POSSIBLY FRANCE?

12:54.033 --> 12:55.033
YEAH! FRANCE!

12:55.033 --> 12:57.400
THE GATEWAY TO ST. LOUIS.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.066
SO WHO IS SHE?
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

13:00.066 --> 13:02.000
HAVEN'T TALKED
TO HER YET.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.600
BUT, SHAWN,
THAT'S UNLIKE YOU.

13:03.600 --> 13:09.000
I AM NOT SHAWN TONIGHT.
YOU ARE, SO GO FIND HER.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.233
NAH. I GOT TOPANGA.

13:11.233 --> 13:14.600
I FEEL WEIRD ENOUGH
AT THIS PARTY
WITHOUT HER.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.700
ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO
IS TALK.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.567
WELL, WHAT DO WE
TALK ABOUT?

13:18.567 --> 13:21.100
CHEESE. THEY LOVE IT.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.033
THEN CHEESE IT IS.

13:28.233 --> 13:30.500
JACK HIGH. I WIN.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.467
THIS COULD BE
THE LEAST AMOUNT
OF FUN

13:32.467 --> 13:34.000
I'VE EVER HAD
IN MY LIFE.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.200
MATTHEWS, I'M NOT
SAYING YOU'RE CHEATING.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.367
I'M THINKING IT
REALLY HARD,

13:38.367 --> 13:40.033
BUT I'M NOT SAYING IT.

13:40.033 --> 13:42.233
JUST FOR MY OWN
PEACE OF MIND--

13:42.233 --> 13:43.700
STOP WITH
THE PLEASANTRIES!

13:43.700 --> 13:45.667
AS PRINCIPAL

13:45.667 --> 13:48.400
I DEMAND TO KNOW
HOW YOU'RE DOING THIS.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.500
YOU'RE NOT
THE PRINCIPAL!

13:51.567 --> 13:54.000
YOU JUST KEEP
THINKING THAT, GEORGE.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.600
HEY, NOW I'M NOT
DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.934
OH. PICK THOSE UP,
MATTHEWS.

13:58.934 --> 14:01.900
SURE. THERE'S ONLY
238 PRETZEL STICKS.

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.033

4,572 GRAINS OF SALT.

14:07.033 --> 14:08.300

BUT THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!

14:20.667 --> 14:23.600
THE FUN DOESN'T
HAVE TO STOP, ERIC.

I'M TAKING
MY FAVORITE STUDENTS

MR. SORRELL.

14:35.300 --> 14:36.367
IT'S DR. SORRELL.

14:36.367 --> 14:39.967

WITH BEING YOU?

16:21.367 --> 16:22.367

I CAME HERE BECAUSE
I NEEDED A CHANGE.

TO BREAK UP.

ABOUT YOU NOW.
