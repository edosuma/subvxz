(pop music in Arabic
playing on headphones)

01:36.160 --> 01:38.549
*

02:06.920 --> 02:09.457
*

02:47.960 --> 02:49.268
Aisha, no!

02:49.970 --> 02:51.426
She's down, she's down!

02:51.470 --> 02:52.960
HADDAD:
Aisha.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.763
SEAL:
Got movement!
Aisha.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.802
Aisha! Aisha.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.977
Move. Move!

03:23.770 --> 03:26.967
Aisha, Aisha.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.707
JASON:
Phone.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.288
Movement!

03:52.300 --> 03:55.952
Get up! Get up!

03:56.000 --> 03:58.628
Clear.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.888
Let's go.
D-Rock,

04:00.940 --> 04:02.760
stay here with them.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.511
Trent, how's she looking?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.551
She's in trouble.

04:24.590 --> 04:26.922
Boss.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.627
Okay. Hey.

04:31.670 --> 04:34.332
HADDAD:
Aisha, Aisha.

04:34.370 --> 04:36.406
Target secured.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.058
Hey. Hey, shut
your mouth.

04:56.090 --> 04:57.318
Please, I'm a doctor.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.429
Let me help
my daughter, please.

04:58.460 --> 04:59.620
He speaks English.

04:59.660 --> 05:01.093
Yeah, that's exactly
what I just thought.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.563
Please, let me help
her, I'm begging you.
Listen to me,

05:02.600 --> 05:03.794
she's in good hands,
all right?

05:03.830 --> 05:04.865
We're gonna take
good care of her.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.492
Get him in the other room.
Aisha.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.831
Keep him quiet, take
him in there, will you?

05:09.870 --> 05:12.407
Come on.
Let's go.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.839
Why are you doing this?

05:13.880 --> 05:15.632
Why are you doing...?
Please!

05:15.680 --> 05:16.806
Please, Aisha!

05:16.850 --> 05:18.977
In the other room.
A-Aisha!

05:22.450 --> 05:24.714
Brock! Brock,
get upstairs.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.479
Keep her quiet, will you?
Copy that.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.488
Here you go.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.851
Hey, come on. Let's go.

05:29.890 --> 05:30.720
Kid, what are you
doing? Come on.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.648
Stop second-guessing
yourself, all right?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.622
You made the right call.
All right? Guy had an AK.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.359
Shot was downrange.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.958
Can't take it back.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.560
But what you can do right now is
get your head back in the game.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.828
You hear me?
Yeah.

05:42.870 --> 05:43.837
Yeah
Yeah.

05:43.870 --> 05:44.859
Yeah.
Good. Get over there.

05:44.910 --> 05:47.731
Help patch her
up. Let's go.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.907
Hey, help me get her
to the kitchen table.

05:51.950 --> 05:53.918
All right? You get the
high, I'll get low.

05:53.950 --> 05:56.748
I'll say when.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.452
One, two, three.

06:17.470 --> 06:19.438
All right, ready?
Yeah.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.936
ALPHA TEAM LEADER :
Bravo 1, this is Alpha 2.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.642
We're on the roof, setting up
overwatch. How copy?

06:23.680 --> 06:24.999
Good copy, Alpha 2.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.608
Alpha 2 out.

06:26.650 --> 06:30.086
Hey, boss, I got the mom
and the kid upstairs.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.509
Kid's about
eight or nine.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.982
Look, let's ﬁnd this phone
and get the hell out of Dodge.

06:34.020 --> 06:34.782
Start on the first floor.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.186
Clear the front room.
Roger that.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.857
How is she?
It's not good,
it's bad.

06:38.890 --> 06:41.450
Took a hit-- very top
of the clavicle, right?

06:41.500 --> 06:42.797
Well, her mom's
upstairs. Let me go see

06:42.830 --> 06:43.899
what she has to say, okay?

07:00.780 --> 07:02.611
What have you done
with my wife and son?

07:02.650 --> 07:05.118
They're fine.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.549
Come on.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.887
Get up.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.456
I want to see them.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.458
I'm sorry, but that
can't happen right now.

07:11.490 --> 07:12.957
Then tell _me what
you're domg here.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.921
We're looking
for a phone

07:13.960 --> 07:15.951
and you're gonna
give it to us.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.558
What kind of phone? What
are you talking about?

07:17.600 --> 07:18.794
We'll know when we find it.

07:18.830 --> 07:20.934
Maybe it's this one, Ray.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.831
Yeah.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.470
It's not it.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.215
I have done
nothing wrong.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.616
Please let me take my daughter
to the hospital.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.013
You help me find
the right phone,

07:41.060 --> 07:42.652
and we will.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.911
*

08:22.100 --> 08:25.661
Yahtzee.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.035
Got one. It was in the
small room off the kitchen.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.206
Looks like it might belong
to the girl.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.242
Check it.

08:41.180 --> 08:43.216
SONNY :
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.708
Got the cell phone,
five SIM cards, and reading now.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.057
Sounds like you got
the golden ticket.

08:48.090 --> 08:50.729
I've always kind of wanted
to meet Willy Wonka.

08:50.760 --> 08:54.890
He would be
the Gene Wilder Wonka.

08:54.930 --> 08:59.162
Johnny Depp's interpretation
of the character

08:59.200 --> 09:01.236
was just a little weird
for my taste.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.979
I'm sorry, boss.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.841
There is no golden ticket
on my end.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.199
Keep looking.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.047
Ray.
It's not it.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.911
Where's the other phone?

09:15.950 --> 09:18.009
Please. My daughter
needs a hospital.
Stop. Please. Stop.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.586
There is another phone
in this house.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.110
The sooner we get the phone,
the sooner we'll leave.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.185
Where is the phone?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.118
There are three phones, you
have them. That's all we have.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.991
I don't understand what
you're domg In my house.

09:27.030 --> 09:29.225
Ray.
You know we're gonna
find it sooner or later.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.296
You gonna make us tear
this place apart first?

09:31.330 --> 09:33.366
If you find this phone you're
looking for, you'll leave?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.834
RAY:
The phone and whoever it belongs
to, he'll have to come with us.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.360
But your wife can take your
daughter to the hospital.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.139
Yeah. Maybe it's you.
You got the phone, huh?

09:39.170 --> 09:40.933
You're caught.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.675
So now the question
becomes what?

09:42.710 --> 09:44.940
Are you gonna bring your
whole family down with you?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.911
Do either of you have children?

09:48.950 --> 09:51.680
If it were your daughter
bleeding in there, maybe dying,

09:51.720 --> 09:53.756
is there anything you wouldn't
do to get her help?

09:53.790 --> 09:55.087
If I could give you
what you want, I would.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.849
Does your son have a phone?

09:56.890 --> 09:58.380
He's only eight.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.853
There's only four of you
that live in the house.
Yes.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.925
What do you say, boss?
Do it the hard way,

10:02.970 --> 10:05.188
tear this place apart?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.039
Tear it apart.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.935
Copy that.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.703
You speak good English.
You think the only
reason someone

10:16.750 --> 10:18.638
would learn your language
is if they intend you harm?

10:18.680 --> 10:20.978
The guy we're looking for, he's
supposed to speak good English.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.147
The man with the phone.
Yeah, the man with the phone.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.146
I went to medical school.
Where?

10:25.190 --> 10:28.079
In Texas.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.951
Watch him.

10:34.930 --> 10:36.249
JASON :
TOC, it's Bravo 1.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.892
Go for TOC.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.137
Target secure.
Four detained...

10:40.170 --> 10:41.398
including one child.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.203
One noncombatant injured.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.901
We're rendering aid.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.168
What happened?

10:46.210 --> 10:47.370
Shot a teenager on the way in.

10:47.410 --> 10:49.298
Dad drew down upon us.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.308
She picked the wrong time
to step in front of him.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.841
ERIC:
Understood, Bravo 1.
How is she?

10:53.880 --> 10:56.371
She lost a lot_ of blood.
Trying to stabilize her now.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.217
All right. Keep us posted.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.184
What about the phone?

11:00.220 --> 11:02.825
We got three,
multiple SIM cards.

11:02.860 --> 11:05.021
None of them
are the ones we need.

11:07.060 --> 11:10.689
Are you sure
we're at the right target house?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.399
Your IR lasso is coming
from the same house

11:15.440 --> 11:16.998
we pinged the phone to.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.736
So the phone
is pinging you right now?

11:19.780 --> 11:20.929
No, and actually, we lost

11:20.980 --> 11:22.208
the fix on that
about an hour ago

11:22.240 --> 11:24.879
dunnginﬁL

11:24.910 --> 11:26.468
So the pinging
killed the battery?

11:26.510 --> 11:29.217
Or somebody popped out
the SIM card. Bottom line,

11:29.250 --> 11:32.344
signal intel has the phone
in the house as of an hour ago.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.415
Drone surveillance says no
one's left the target building

11:34.460 --> 11:36.018
since we lost contact.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.186
So the phone
is in there somewhere.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.793
RAY:
I heard.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.092
Wouldn't be the first time

11:41.130 --> 11:42.768
intel sent us
to the wrong address.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.324
Remember Libya?

11:47.300 --> 11:49.495
TOC, we got one
military-age male on target.

11:49.540 --> 11:52.361
Recommend we cut bait,
bring him with us,

11:52.410 --> 11:54.298
get the girl to the hospital.
How copy?

11:54.340 --> 11:56.308
Good copy, Bravo 1.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.047
Wait one.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.446
Bravo 1, this is General Cook.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.289
Son, you understand

12:03.320 --> 12:05.845
whoever has that phone
runs an online recruitment site

12:05.890 --> 12:08.313
linked to at least eight
domestic terror suspects?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.180
Yes, sir. Read the briefing.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.822
And did your brief include
the names and photographs

12:11.860 --> 12:13.896
of all 36 Americans killed

12:13.930 --> 12:15.329
at that resort in Malaysia?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.896
Yes, it did, sir.

12:16.930 --> 12:19.023
And the fact that the bomber
spent over 19 hours

12:19.070 --> 12:20.367
at the website in question?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.539
Think you'll agree
that justifies

12:22.570 --> 12:25.130
spending a few more minutes
on target.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.832
Copy that, sir.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.144
Sir, keep in mind

12:31.180 --> 12:32.340
that we're already
several minutes

12:32.380 --> 12:35.076
past our optimal time on target.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.473
In 35 minutes,

12:36.520 --> 12:39.341
that city is gonna wake
up for morning prayer.

12:39.390 --> 12:40.982
Exfil after that is...

12:41.020 --> 12:42.214
it's damn near impossible.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.228
It's risking a riot.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.057
I understand that, Eric.

12:46.090 --> 12:48.923
Why I'm hoping
your boys will move fast.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.239
We need her systolic way up.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.498
I know.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.361
Command says we stay
until we find that phone.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.809
She may not have that long.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.400
She lost a lot of blood.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.579
It's too low.
I can't read anything.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.408
Command believes the lives
we might save finding that phone

13:07.450 --> 13:10.214
outweighs this life.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.569
You are the man in charge
of this circus, yes?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.239
Bravo 3's downstairs. Take his
place, tell hIm to come up.
Roger that.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.272
I heard the sound of
my husband's voice

13:34.310 --> 13:35.436
through the floor,
so I know he's alive.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.846
Tell me about my daughter.
Your daughter's been injured.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.108
We're giving her
medical attention

13:39.150 --> 13:41.573
right now.
She's injured?

13:41.620 --> 13:44.145
You mean, one of you broke
into our house and shot her.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.249
An unarmed girl.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.212
Yes.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.287
Your daughter needs blood.

13:52.330 --> 13:53.524
My daughter needs a hospital!

13:53.560 --> 13:55.619
You can take her to one as soon
as we're gone, understand?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.321
Then get out of my house!

13:57.370 --> 13:58.519
I will take her now!

13:58.570 --> 14:00.891
Ma'am, arguing is
a waste of time.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.567
Now, we have a field
blood type test to make sure

14:02.600 --> 14:04.158
you and your daughter
are compatible.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.563
My advice?

14:05.610 --> 14:08.135
Let us run that test.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.273
If you're a match,
we'll take you downstairs,

14:10.310 --> 14:11.538
draw your blood,
and ask you some questions.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.070
You mean while you figure out

14:13.120 --> 14:14.940
that you're in the wrong place?

14:14.980 --> 14:16.641
That you kicked in the door
of an innocent family?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.409
Your daughter does not have
time for this right now.

14:18.450 --> 14:22.113
Please.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.128
My husband is a doctor.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.582
Yes, and as we
tried to tell him,

14:25.630 --> 14:27.552
there's nobody in the world
better equipped

14:27.600 --> 14:30.023
for treating gunshot wounds
than these men.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.492
Best thing you and
your husband can do

14:31.530 --> 14:32.929
for your daughter right now

14:32.970 --> 14:34.335
is to answer our questions.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.258
Sooner we have answers,

14:36.300 --> 14:38.507
sooner we're gone.
Look at this. Hey.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.974
Hey. Hey.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.898
Light?

14:45.280 --> 14:48.943
Here, okay.
All right.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.618
Let's make ourselves scarce,
little buddy, and...

14:50.650 --> 14:53.255
let the grown-ups
talk here, okay?

14:53.290 --> 14:55.258
Come on.

14:55.290 --> 14:57.178
Look at this right here.
It's a glowstick.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.186
Yeah, they're cool, huh?

14:59.230 --> 15:01.949
You wave it in front
of your face like this.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.218
Look at me. Ooh! It's cool.

15:14.710 --> 15:17.178
They're in the
bathroom, right.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.671
Come on.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.031
Yeah, I'm surprised he's not
a little more concerned

15:42.070 --> 15:43.162
about that girl dying.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.202
Not even from a PR standpoint?

15:46.240 --> 15:48.231
If you want
to get into a general's head,

15:48.280 --> 15:51.044
I find it helpful to think
of everything as a number.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.674
People, food,
bullets, countries...

15:53.720 --> 15:55.540
You figure they're
all like that?

15:55.580 --> 15:58.117
I mean, officers?

15:58.150 --> 16:01.313
I can only judge
by those I've met.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.321
What, Sonny told you?

16:05.360 --> 16:07.453
Oh, that you're...

16:07.500 --> 16:10.469
applying to officer training?

16:10.500 --> 16:13.628
Yeah. Come on, OTC?
I think that's great.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.592
Thank you. But I
will remind you

16:15.640 --> 16:17.164
that this is the Navy,

16:17.210 --> 16:19.030
and it's called
Officer Candidate School,

16:19.070 --> 16:20.674
so keep your voice down.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.439
Congratulations.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.675
Save it for when I get in.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.746
Why are you even
keeping it a secret?
Come on.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.645
I mean, you see how these
guys feel about the officers.

16:28.680 --> 16:29.749
Cake-eaters.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.384
Yeah.
They seem to like

16:31.420 --> 16:33.308
Blackburn, though.
Yeah, well...

16:33.360 --> 16:36.011
somehow I just feel
like I'm betraying them.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.278
As long as you don't
end up like him.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.456
Figure General Cook cares

16:39.490 --> 16:41.629
if that girl lives or dies?

16:41.660 --> 16:43.298
Damage is done, PR-wise.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.389
We sent a team into Yemen,

16:45.430 --> 16:47.193
the one war zone in the region

16:47.240 --> 16:48.298
we're not actively fighting in.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.308
We kicked down a family's door

16:50.340 --> 16:51.807
and shot their little girl.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.172
So it's less important
to save the girl's life

16:54.210 --> 16:56.235
than it is to prove
that we were in the right place.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.601
Yeah, it is a lot easier

16:58.650 --> 17:00.242
if you think about her
as a number.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.418
that's never gonna be you,
though.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.155
How's she doing?

17:09.190 --> 17:10.555
Stable for now.

17:10.590 --> 17:12.080
Could have really used
a surgeon,

17:12.130 --> 17:13.392
but her lung
hasn't collapsed yet.

17:13.430 --> 17:14.419
Good. Well, that's something.
Yeah.

17:14.460 --> 17:15.791
Ray's got the mom
in the bathroom. She's ready

17:15.830 --> 17:17.263
to give the blood
for the transfusion.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.426
It's kind of rislq.
Yeah.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.290
But it's her only option.
Okay. That's it.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.161
You good with him?
Yeah, I'm good.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.632
You sure?
Yeah.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.137
Let's go. Wash up best you can.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.309
Okay? You're gonna
draw the blood

17:28.340 --> 17:29.773
while Ray interrogates her.
Got it?

17:40.790 --> 17:43.827
I don't know
about another cell phone.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.158
How many people
live in this house?

17:46.190 --> 17:48.624
I told you,
there are four of us.

17:48.660 --> 17:51.197
Anybody leave here right
before we showed up?

17:51.230 --> 17:54.131
No.

17:54.170 --> 17:57.333
How long have you lived
in this house?

17:57.370 --> 17:59.338
Two years.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.509
When we moved from Zinjibar.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.677
Why did you move?

18:02.710 --> 18:05.372
The fighting.

18:05.410 --> 18:07.412
The Saudis bombed us.

18:07.450 --> 18:10.442
My children deserve a future.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.379
My daughter...

18:13.420 --> 18:16.856
is going to be a doctor,
like her father.

18:16.890 --> 18:20.223
What is your husband's name?

18:20.260 --> 18:22.194
Haddad Sayid Bashar.

18:22.230 --> 18:25.461
Does he have
a second mobile phone?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.491
I told you, no.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.235
Does he have a computer?

18:29.270 --> 18:31.704
I already told you, at his work.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.537
Where does he work?

18:33.580 --> 18:36.401
Al Salam Hospital.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.704
Please...

18:38.750 --> 18:41.446
let us take our daughter there.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.482
Soon, ma'am.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.748
Soon. Now, you're certain

18:44.790 --> 18:46.382
he doesn't have a
second cell phone?

18:46.420 --> 18:48.217
I don't know! Ask him.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.251
He will tell you.

18:52.330 --> 18:54.719
How we coming with that draw?

18:54.760 --> 18:56.455
Yeah, we're all good.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.661
HADDAD:
I don't know

18:58.700 --> 19:00.634
about any websites that
recruits terrorists.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.558
I have nothing to do with AQ.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.204
They're not true Muslims.
Okay.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.639
But you are?
Yes.

19:05.670 --> 19:07.638
I told you, I don't have
anything against America.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.170
I studied in America.

19:09.210 --> 19:10.438
This here.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.948
What was this doing
in your bedroom, hmm?

19:12.980 --> 19:14.845
Why did we find that there?

19:16.480 --> 19:19.210
I'm not a jihadist.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.683
You got to do better
than that, Doc.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.553
Someone I knew many years
back gave me that.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.854
He knew the guy who
wrote it, Khalid Hazazi.

19:25.890 --> 19:27.619
I didn't even know
I still had that.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.197
Why'd he give it to you?

19:30.230 --> 19:32.391
A hospital I was working at

19:32.430 --> 19:33.863
was blown up by an air strike.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.959
By the Saudis, using
an American drone.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.661
My friend was very angry.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.962
He wanted to do something.
Must have made you angry.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.739
Not enough
to become a terrorist.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.577
Enough to sympathize with them?

19:43.610 --> 19:45.544
No. I went to hear Hazazi
speak at his mosque.

19:45.580 --> 19:46.376
It was hateful.

19:46.410 --> 19:48.446
_ I do not believe
In Violent solutions

19:48.480 --> 19:49.913
to violent problems.

19:49.950 --> 19:52.544
The name of your friend
who gave you that magazine.

19:52.590 --> 19:53.852
That's what I need. The name.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.517
Why? So you can
knock his door down

19:55.560 --> 19:57.949
and shoot his daughter, too?
That your answer?

20:02.400 --> 20:03.822
His name is Akram Qasim.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.362
He was a friend, but I
do not share his beliefs.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.731
_I have not seen
mm In many years.

20:08.770 --> 20:10.260
Take it to the wife

20:10.310 --> 20:12.938
and see if the stories match.

20:17.310 --> 20:19.642
What's your medical specialty?

20:39.770 --> 20:43.433
What's the bear's name?

20:43.470 --> 20:45.609
Zak.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.608
Zak. He looks like a Zak.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.699
Well, Mr. Zak the bear,

20:49.740 --> 20:52.607
would you happen to know

20:52.650 --> 20:55.346
where a cell phone like this
might be hiding

20:55.380 --> 20:56.642
in the house?

20:56.680 --> 20:58.580
He's just a toy.

20:58.620 --> 20:59.985
Yeah, good point.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.986
You'd tell me, though, right?

21:07.530 --> 21:09.828
If you happened to know
where a cell phone was?

21:09.860 --> 21:13.694
Is my sister going to die?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.436
No, no.

21:16.470 --> 21:19.701
She's, uh...
she gonna be just fine.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.969
Uh, football. Yeah.

21:25.010 --> 21:28.810
Gunter... Schonbach
from Germany?

21:28.850 --> 21:30.647
Yeah, he's a hell of a player.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.009
Yeah.

21:32.050 --> 21:33.017
Here.

21:33.050 --> 21:35.450
Goal!

21:36.860 --> 21:38.589
Yes, I play.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.427
The best in my school.

21:40.460 --> 21:41.825
No kidding?

21:41.860 --> 21:43.589
Yeah, I was, too, man.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.564
Back in the day, they, uh...

21:45.600 --> 21:47.693
they used to call me Magic Feet.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.731
Yeah.

21:49.770 --> 21:51.863
Spike the bag and make
sure it's primed.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.435
I got it.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.643
It isn't primed, you could
give her a blood clot.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.649
That's great. So we didn't
kill her with a bullet,

22:00.680 --> 22:02.477
I can kill her
with a blood clot.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.511
Nice.

22:05.890 --> 22:07.710
Okay, good.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.729
Open the roller clamp,
squeeze the bag.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.031
All right.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.774
How long till she gets
that rush of oxygen

22:28.810 --> 22:29.834
you were talking about?

22:29.880 --> 22:31.973
Any time.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.720
Welcome back.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.533
You're safe now.

22:58.570 --> 23:01.698
Just rest.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.742
You're okay.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.687
We have confirmation
of a Haddad Bashar

23:16.720 --> 23:18.722
that matches the description
that you sent.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.422
Yemeni national,
53 years old.

23:21.460 --> 23:24.759
Currently a senior physician
at Al Salam Hospital in Sanaa.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.461
Wife corroborates.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.660
On the other hand,
you found the material

23:29.700 --> 23:31.759
by Khalid Hazazi in the house.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.074
He says a friend gave it to him.
So, you have

23:34.110 --> 23:36.670
one military-aged
male on target,

23:36.710 --> 23:39.201
devoutly religious,
speaks fluent English,

23:39.250 --> 23:40.911
owns an automatic weapon.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.440
Guy lives in a war zone.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.584
Of course he's gonna have an AK
in the house.

23:44.620 --> 23:45.814
The point is,

23:45.850 --> 23:47.556
he could fit
the profile of somebody

23:47.590 --> 23:50.218
who's recruiting citizens of
Western countries to his cause.

23:50.260 --> 23:51.955
Maybe he's our Mr. Big,
maybe he isn't,

23:51.990 --> 23:53.526
but we can still bring him in.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.551
Just let the station chief
in Bahrain sort that out.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.999
If they determine he's innocent,

23:57.030 --> 23:58.964
he'll be back home
in a few days.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.536
All I'm saying is,
if we're gonna

24:00.570 --> 24:01.969
call this a dry hole,
we'd better do it

24:02.000 --> 24:05.709
so we can get this girl to the
hospital and save her life.

24:05.740 --> 24:08.504
ALPHA TEAM LEADER:
All call signs, be advised
we've got activity

24:08.540 --> 24:10.132
street side,
truck approaching.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.171
What do you got, Davis?

24:13.980 --> 24:16.210
DAVIS:
ISR shows unknown vehicle

24:16.250 --> 24:17.740
pulling in
to park outside the target.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.881
The wife?
Said she never heard

24:24.930 --> 24:27.023
of Khalid Hazazi. Didn't even
know the pamphlet was there.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.119
Transfusion take?
Yeah, it's all good.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.821
The husband?
Alpha 1's got him.

24:32.630 --> 24:34.234
Keep all detainees
away from the windows.

24:34.270 --> 24:35.737
Alpha and Bravo teams,

24:35.770 --> 24:37.931
one person inbound
approaching the front door.

24:37.970 --> 24:39.528
Overwatch, you got him?

24:39.570 --> 24:41.128
ALPHA TEAM LEADER:
Affirmative. Just say the word.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.807
We got a shot from here.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.273
No, I don't want
to wake the neighborhood.

24:44.310 --> 24:46.141
We'll take him
when he's inside the door.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.148
Alpha Team standing by.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.546
_This turns out to be _
the maI|man, we're gonna owe hIm

24:50.590 --> 24:52.478
an apology.

25:17.310 --> 25:18.572
EngHsh?
EngHsh!

25:18.610 --> 25:20.578
Ray, ask him if
he speaks English.

25:31.590 --> 25:33.057
Says he's coming home
for morning prayer.

25:33.090 --> 25:35.024
What do you mean,
he's coming home?
That's what he said.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.620
Phone.
Run it. Go. Run it.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.763
Flip him. Flip him.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.291
The mom, the dad both said
there are only four people

25:42.340 --> 25:44.729
who are living here, huh?
Ask him who lives in the house.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.576
Says he's the wife's cousin.

25:49.610 --> 25:51.669
Why is he holding a gun?
Ask him that.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.154
Says he was
robbed last week.
Last week.

26:01.190 --> 26:03.158
It's not a match.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.327
It's not a match.
What's on it?

26:04.360 --> 26:05.622
Not a lot, man.
A few phone numbers.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.696
All calls made since yesterday.
No texts.

26:07.730 --> 26:08.890
RAY:
Maybe he doesn't
have a lot of friends.

26:08.930 --> 26:12.127
Well, maybe he's got another
phone and doesn't use that one.

26:17.370 --> 26:19.930
Says it was taken last week
when he was robbed.

26:19.970 --> 26:22.370
He just bought this one.
JASON:
Pull him up.

26:22.410 --> 26:24.674
Hey, come on. Smile.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.201
Thank you.

26:30.820 --> 26:35.189
TOC, Bravo. I'm sending you
a picture of our new arrival.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.688
DAVIS:_ _
Yeah, they're comIng In now.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.721
Also gonna send you

26:40.760 --> 26:42.625
a picture of the serial number

26:42.660 --> 26:43.695
of the Glock we got off him.

26:43.730 --> 26:46.369
He had a handgun?
Yeah, tried to pull it on us.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.765
Kind of hurt
my feelings.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.994
Copy that.
I'm gonna run all this

26:49.040 --> 26:51.201
and call you back
as soon as we get a hit.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.708
Copy. 1 out.

26:55.110 --> 26:56.634
What about him?

26:56.680 --> 26:59.103
I don't know. Guy's not
exactly Doc Holliday,

26:59.150 --> 27:01.072
way he fumbled that gun.
We lose that girl,

27:01.120 --> 27:02.917
it's gonna
affect Clay.

27:02.950 --> 27:05.043
Clay did two deployments
in Afghanistan with Team 3.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.978
All right?
Can't be the first time

27:07.020 --> 27:08.749
he hurt someone
he didn't intend to.

27:08.790 --> 27:10.189
He's never shot a girl before.

27:10.220 --> 27:11.721
Maybe, but it was
the right call.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.227
The dad had an AK.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.852
Yeah, I know. I told him.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.788
Okay.

27:18.230 --> 27:20.323
What's up, boss?
What are you thinking?

27:22.900 --> 27:25.835
Girl in there reminds
me of my daughter Emma.

27:30.410 --> 27:32.446
Feel a whole lot better
about the situation if I knew

27:32.480 --> 27:34.345
we were certain
we were In the rIght place.

27:34.380 --> 27:36.211
Taking another shot
at the dad. Watch him.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.309
I'll get Alpha 1 out here.

27:42.020 --> 27:43.988
Is there a reason
we seem so much more concerned

27:44.030 --> 27:45.884
about this man's handgun
than the father's rifle?

27:45.930 --> 27:47.727
This neck of the woods,
you're hard-pressed

27:47.760 --> 27:49.455
to find a house
that doesn't have an AK.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.297
Handguns, though,
usually means bad guys.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.764
So you believe
the new arrival's our man?

27:53.800 --> 27:55.165
Believe it's a possibility.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.430
Need to get this sorted
real quick.

27:57.470 --> 27:59.438
15 minutes till drop-dead time.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.439
Yes, sir.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.142
I'm sure our guys
are keeping track.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.740
JASON:
You told me only four
people were living here.

28:07.780 --> 28:09.839
That is right. Naseem only
sleeps here weekdays.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.882
He doesn't live here.
He's from the desert.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.457
He must come
to the city to work.
What does he do?

28:14.490 --> 28:16.754
He's a truck driver.

28:16.790 --> 28:19.827
He have any desire
to hurt Americans?

28:22.030 --> 28:25.261
Young men everywhere
are angry.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.860
But I don't think
he would act on his anger.

28:27.900 --> 28:31.734
_ RAY: _ _
Naseem actIve on soaal medIa,
as far as you know?

28:31.770 --> 28:34.477
I doubt it. I don't think
he reads very well.

28:34.510 --> 28:36.774
If you're lying, you're
protecting the man

28:36.810 --> 28:38.243
who brought violence
into this home.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.408
You are the one who brought
violence into this home.

28:43.150 --> 28:45.983
MANDY:
Naseem Al-Gharsi, 25.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.250
Arrested at a violent protest
outside the US. Embassy

28:48.290 --> 28:50.986
in late 2014--
that's just before it closed.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.453
Nothing since,
but Yemeni police don't tend

28:53.490 --> 28:56.857
to punish guys caught protesting
the US. or the Saudis.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.925
Family failed
to mention that detail.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.767
Oh, it was three years ago.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.258
Still, he does seem to fit our
profile-- age and background.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.937
Guy doesn't speak any English.

29:05.970 --> 29:07.870
Could he be playing dumb?

29:07.910 --> 29:10.902
Well, if he is,
he's pretty damn good at it.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.941
Any information on the gun?

29:12.980 --> 29:14.516
The serial number says
it belonged

29:14.550 --> 29:18.042
to an Iraqi police captain,
reported stolen in '09.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.785
Captain probably sold it
on the black market.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.014
Most likely.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.119
Probably had 20 owners
since then.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.357
So, basically,
we're back to where we started.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.826
Basically, yeah.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.896
Ma'am, what can you tell us
about Cousin Naseem?

29:31.930 --> 29:34.239
Nothing.
Not until I see my daughter.

29:34.270 --> 29:38.502
Ma'am...
Yes, I know. "We don't
have time." Make time!

29:38.540 --> 29:40.428
She's still very weak.

29:40.470 --> 29:44.076
You told_me
she was conSCIous now.

29:44.110 --> 29:45.975
Barely. You got to wait

29:46.010 --> 29:49.013
until she's gotten
all the blood you gave her.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.952
Fine.

29:55.990 --> 29:57.981
We'll wait.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.924
All right, you've seen her.

30:41.900 --> 30:44.937
Need to ask you some questions
about Cousin Naseem.

30:44.970 --> 30:46.608
Cousin Naseem.
Yeah.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.905
Yes. I suppose he's now
your terrorist mastermind.

30:49.940 --> 30:52.545
What about my husband?

30:52.580 --> 30:55.447
You are so desperate

30:55.480 --> 30:57.311
not to admit
you're In the wrong place

30:57.350 --> 31:00.387
that you will stay until
you get the answer you want,

31:00.420 --> 31:03.184
even if it means
my daughter dies.
Look,

31:03.220 --> 31:04.585
we're doing everything
we can, okay,

31:04.630 --> 31:06.882
to save your daughter right now.

31:06.930 --> 31:08.454
And if we're in
the wrong place,

31:08.500 --> 31:10.354
I'd be the first
one to say that.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.369
But right now I need to ask you
some questions about Naseem.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.039
What do you want to know?

31:16.070 --> 31:19.005
He's my brother's eldest son.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.179
He left school
when he was 11 years old

31:21.210 --> 31:23.178
to work
in his father's metal shop,

31:23.210 --> 31:24.472
and now he drives trucks.

31:24.510 --> 31:25.943
Okay, trucks for what?

31:25.980 --> 31:27.675
What do you want
to hear-- that he

31:27.710 --> 31:29.519
transports guns
and bombs?

31:29.550 --> 31:31.211
You've met
Naseem.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.444
Does he seem
lIke someone

31:32.490 --> 31:34.185
you would trust
with your weapons?

31:34.220 --> 31:37.417
No. No. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.691
Any luck?
Nah.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.937
Thought I'd take
a shot at the boy.

31:53.740 --> 31:56.004
How you doing, little buddy?

32:00.050 --> 32:03.645
You understand
your SIster's hurt, rIght?

32:03.680 --> 32:07.639
Huh

32:07.690 --> 32:11.057
Notgood.

32:13.060 --> 32:16.996
Listen, we want to take her

32:17.030 --> 32:20.193
to your daddy's hospital, okay?

32:20.230 --> 32:23.393
But my boss--
he ain't gonna let us leave here

32:23.440 --> 32:27.467
until we find what we came for.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.970
We need to help her right now
before she gets any worse.

32:40.490 --> 32:43.050
I can tell_
she's a good SIster.

32:44.460 --> 32:47.486
She really needs
your help right now.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.259
Hey.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.602
Hmm?

33:13.650 --> 33:15.652
*

33:51.230 --> 33:53.551
Holy crap.

33:55.630 --> 33:57.495
Pulled it from the drain.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.760
Kid found it.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.630
Jackpot.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.500
Who does this
phone belong to?

34:10.540 --> 34:13.179
Me. My phone.

34:17.350 --> 34:18.442
REEMA:
Junaid!

34:19.890 --> 34:22.609
Oh, no. Let him go.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.829
JUNAID:
Aisha.

34:24.860 --> 34:27.488
Ais'ha.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.391
The boy gave us this phone,
says it's his.

34:34.440 --> 34:38.308
No. It is mine.

34:39.910 --> 34:42.504
It is my phone.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.744
JASON:
TOC, it's Bravo 1.
Wife says the phone's hers.

34:53.790 --> 34:55.212
I have my doubts.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.683
Let's see, 76192.
It's a serial number.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.721
That's all I got.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.354
I'm on it. See
what I can get.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.890
Hey, did you open that up yet?

35:02.930 --> 35:05.592
Negative. Phone's locked.

35:05.630 --> 35:08.531
Gonna try and use the
fingerprint ID to open it.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.162
Okay. Be careful, 'cause it
looks like

35:10.200 --> 35:12.361
it's a Gate Stream 125.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.537
I looked it up. You've got three
chances at touch recognition

35:14.580 --> 35:15.831
before it locks you out.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.201
Good to know.

35:18.250 --> 35:21.845
Honestly, at this point,
why does it matter?

35:21.880 --> 35:23.370
The phone's in their house.

35:23.420 --> 35:24.887
That's good enough for me.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.911
Let's round 'em up,
get out of there.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.156
Excuse me, sir?

35:28.190 --> 35:30.181
The phone's in the house,

35:30.220 --> 35:32.154
we take the occupants
of the house.

35:32.190 --> 35:33.555
Pardon me, sir,
but when is the last time

35:33.590 --> 35:35.296
you pulled someone
off of a target?

35:35.330 --> 35:36.797
This isn't a drug bust
where we can throw 15 perps

35:36.830 --> 35:38.468
in the back of
a paddy wagon.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.890
We're prepared for
one HVT, one phone.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.704
You telling me you don't have
helos for four more people?

35:44.740 --> 35:47.504
Some crack operation
you people are running.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.599
With all due respect, sir.

35:49.640 --> 35:50.868
Excuse me,

35:50.910 --> 35:54.175
Petty Officer Davis.

35:54.220 --> 35:57.519
Our infil helos were
two MH6 little birds.

35:57.550 --> 35:59.484
Which was the most that
I could get approved

35:59.520 --> 36:02.580
for the lowest signature in this
non-permissive environment.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.828
Each little bird brought
over six on the benches.

36:05.860 --> 36:07.179
Between the extended
fuel bladders

36:07.230 --> 36:08.458
and this high
heat environment,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.297
we only have
200 pounds left

36:10.330 --> 36:11.763
to spare for exfil.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.358
So yes, sir,

36:13.400 --> 36:15.539
while I might be
able to guarantee

36:15.570 --> 36:18.209
that we could squeeze one
extra person on board a helo

36:18.240 --> 36:20.708
and maybe even lift off,
I cannot guarantee

36:20.740 --> 36:22.628
that anyone will
make it very far.

36:24.610 --> 36:27.545
What he said... sir.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.787
Go try Naseem.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.261
JASON:
So you're saying it's your
phone, but it's not your phone.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.359
REEMA:
He gives me the phone
to hold during the week.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.891
I'm supposed to copy the new
contacts and then erase them.

36:49.940 --> 36:51.339
What is the dude's name?

36:51.370 --> 36:52.405
I can't tell you.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.635
He'll kill my whole family.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.830
How'd you get involved
in this activity?

36:56.880 --> 36:58.700
It was Khalid Hazazi.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.399
The man who wrote
the pamphlet you found.

37:00.450 --> 37:03.317
That belongs to me,
by the way.

37:03.350 --> 37:04.442
I went to hear him
speak last year.

37:04.490 --> 37:05.548
What he said made sense.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.909
We cannot stay silent

37:06.950 --> 37:09.453
while you and the Saudis
try to exterminate us.

37:09.490 --> 37:12.027
JASON:
Your husband aware of
what you've been doing?

37:12.060 --> 37:16.326
He might suspect something,
but I do this alone.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.261
Look, I have told you
everything you need to know.

37:19.300 --> 37:22.337
Take me or whatever
It Is you need to do,

37:22.370 --> 37:24.907
and let Haddad take Aisha
to the hospital.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.339
BROCK:
Hey, boss.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.531
Yeah.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.774
Hey.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.675
So I tried Naseem's print.
It didn't unlock it.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.041
Thanks.
Get the husband.
Okay.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.411
That leaves her.

37:34.450 --> 37:35.917
Yeah, I know. We try
her and it locks,

37:35.950 --> 37:37.417
and we're wrong,
that whole thing locks.

37:37.450 --> 37:38.940
But it could still be her.
It could be any of them.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.514
Either way, we have to go. Call
to prayer's in four minutes.

37:40.550 --> 37:41.756
I'm aware of that.

37:41.790 --> 37:43.018
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.425
What's the update on the phone?

37:44.460 --> 37:46.519
Yeah, Mandy's on it.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.721
It's zero hour, boys.

37:48.760 --> 37:49.852
JASON:
Copy that, TOC.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.492
I'm not convinced it's the wife.

37:51.530 --> 37:54.590
I'm sorry. This woman is telling
you it's her phone.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.767
Am I missing something?
General.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.803
She wants to save
her daughter's life.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.637
Okay, here's what we got.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.079
The phone was purchased five
months ago in Hamburg, Germany.

38:03.110 --> 38:05.840
We're still working
to ID the buyer.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.472
Oh, and you asked me
about Khalid Hazazi,

38:07.510 --> 38:09.011
the guy who wrote the article
you found.

38:09.050 --> 38:10.642
Turns out he was a real baddie.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.819
Was?

38:12.850 --> 38:13.942
Yeah, he was on all
kinds of lists.

38:13.990 --> 38:15.082
Ran out of luck
three years ago.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.485
Predator strike in Libya.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.023
Three years ago.
Are you sure?

38:19.060 --> 38:20.459
I could send you
the death photos,

38:20.490 --> 38:22.094
but I don't think
you'd thank me.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.928
You think the wife's covering
for the husband?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.858
She's covering for someone.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.806
Come on, let's go.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.068
Come on.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.604
Reema.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.732
She's fine.

38:37.780 --> 38:39.475
Yeah, except she just admitted
to being a terrorist.

38:39.510 --> 38:41.375
I thought maybe you'd like
to say good-bye.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.069
That's impossible.
Reema, what are you doing?

38:43.120 --> 38:45.418
'Ana asif, baby.
You didn't know.

38:45.450 --> 38:48.385
No. He didn't know
'cause it's not true.

38:48.420 --> 38:51.548
You said that you heard
Khalid Hazazi speak

38:51.590 --> 38:53.558
one year ago; he's been
dead for three years.

38:53.590 --> 38:55.091
Who are you protecting?

38:55.130 --> 38:56.688
REEMA:
No one.
It is my phone.

38:56.730 --> 38:57.958
HADDAD:
No, Reema, stop.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.467
REEMA: It is my phone!
JASON: It's your phone?

38:59.500 --> 39:01.092
SONNY:
J, come here, hey.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.792
Look, I found these
earlier in the boy's room.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.603
They're playing cards
from Hamburg, Germany.

39:05.640 --> 39:06.959
I just thought
we should chat with him.

39:07.010 --> 39:07.999
Let's do it.

39:11.010 --> 39:11.942
SONNY:
Hey. Hey, buddy.

39:11.980 --> 39:14.972
Hey, my boss, uh, he really
likes those cards,

39:15.020 --> 39:18.114
so wh-wh-_who could
we get It from?

39:18.150 --> 39:20.084
I love this player. Where
can I get this card?

39:20.120 --> 39:21.485
Who gave it to you?

39:22.960 --> 39:24.848
Asef.

39:24.890 --> 39:27.984
Asef. Hey.
Who's Asef?

39:28.030 --> 39:28.997
My sister,

39:29.030 --> 39:30.019

39:30.060 --> 39:31.459
Your sister's
friend is Asef?

39:34.440 --> 39:36.396
It's their daughter's friend.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.930
Is she up?

39:37.970 --> 39:39.858
I can wake her up.
Wake her up.

39:39.910 --> 39:41.537
Aisha.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.070
Aisha! Can you hear me?

39:43.110 --> 39:44.805
Aisha, can you hear me?

39:44.850 --> 39:45.976
Leave her alone!
ERIC :

39:47.950 --> 39:50.145
You've got to proceed now.
Roger that.

39:50.180 --> 39:53.047
Aisha, do you know Asef?
Do you know Asef?

39:53.090 --> 39:55.411
REEMA:
Asef is the one
who gave me the phone!

39:55.460 --> 39:56.882
We work together.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.456
Asef is the one
you are looking for.

39:58.490 --> 40:01.493
Stop it! Stop.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.498
We know he's a friend
of your daughter's.

40:03.530 --> 40:04.895
They are not friends.
He must be using...

40:04.930 --> 40:06.067
Stop it!

40:06.100 --> 40:09.137

40:09.170 --> 40:10.432
HADDAD:
What is he saying, "Asef"?
There is no Asef.

40:10.470 --> 40:11.505
REEMA:
There is.

40:11.540 --> 40:14.065
Asef is from the mosque.

40:14.110 --> 40:15.998
I thought they
were just friends.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.600
He must be forcing her
to help him.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.642
She is just a little girl.

40:33.530 --> 40:36.522
I'm a soldier of God.

41:19.640 --> 41:20.937
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

41:20.970 --> 41:23.029

41:23.080 --> 41:25.105
Copy that, TOC.
We're moving to exfil.

41:25.150 --> 41:29.018
We have one phone, one detainee
under medical treatment.

41:29.050 --> 41:30.608
Copy that, Bravo 1.

41:30.650 --> 41:32.538
See you soon.

41:42.730 --> 41:44.220
What'd she have to say?

41:44.260 --> 41:45.261
Not a lot.

41:45.300 --> 41:46.824
Mostly Qaeda stuff, you know.

41:46.870 --> 41:48.997
Restoration of the Caliphate,
whole nine yards.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.133
Dude, she's a,
she's a true believer.

41:51.170 --> 41:52.603
She get that from
her boyfriend?

41:52.640 --> 41:56.599
Uh, Asef. Teacher,
not boyfriend, her words.

41:56.640 --> 42:00.041
He, uh, gave her the phone,
the instructions, everything.

42:00.080 --> 42:02.071
Out of love?

42:02.120 --> 42:04.611
Yeah, but she says
it's not all about him.

42:04.650 --> 42:05.947
What's it about?

42:05.990 --> 42:07.116
Her best friend got killed

42:07.150 --> 42:08.549
in Zinjibar two years ago

42:08.590 --> 42:09.716
when the Saudis
bombed her house

42:09.760 --> 42:11.751
with our help.

42:11.790 --> 42:13.223
Says, uh, says she owes it
to her friend's memory

42:13.260 --> 42:14.625
to strike back.

42:14.660 --> 42:17.220
We can't control
those deCISIOnS.

42:17.260 --> 42:20.559
We can only control
ours on the ground.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.329
All right.

42:22.370 --> 42:23.667
Okay, let's move.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.737
Let's go, boys.

42:26.770 --> 42:28.909
