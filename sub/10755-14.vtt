This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL, 780.

00:13.643 --> 00:18.055
Frasier, that was security.  
Some woman insisted on seeing you, 
she just blew right past them.

00:18.230 --> 00:21.929
Oh, don't panic, Roz — probably just 
one of my more ardent fans.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.904
Niles, we've got to talk!  It's urgent.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.696
Frasier, I'm with a patient!

00:36.869 --> 00:39.441
- Is, uh, this about a woman? 
- Yes.

00:39.621 --> 00:42.325
Take all the time you need.

00:44.499 --> 00:46.990
- Well?
- She's back...

00:47.168 --> 00:49.872
the scourge of my existence.

00:51.004 --> 00:54.170
Strange, I usually get some sign 
when Lilith is in town —

00:54.340 --> 00:58.716
dogs forming into packs, 
blood weeping down the wall.

00:59.886 --> 01:02.922
I'm talking about... 

01:03.097 --> 01:05.053
Diane Chambers.

01:05.223 --> 01:07.714
Lucille, send Mr. Carr home.

01:11.061 --> 01:13.433
She just showed up at the station today.

01:13.605 --> 01:17.222
Apparently some play she wrote 
is being produced here in town.

01:17.399 --> 01:20.399
I admit, I just sort of panicked 
when I saw her,

01:20.568 --> 01:22.774
but I think I covered it masterfully.

01:22.945 --> 01:25.945
All right, all right, all right.  
Well, uh, why do you think you reacted 
that way?

01:26.114 --> 01:30.360
Oh, spare me the psychiatrist bit, Niles.  
That includes putting down the pad!

01:33.244 --> 01:35.283
In the drawer, Niles!

01:37.122 --> 01:41.748
Fine. My first question to you is this: 
Are you still in love with her?

01:41.917 --> 01:44.871
No! Not in the least! 
It's a ridiculous suggestion.

01:45.045 --> 01:49.504
Seeing as how I have nowhere 
to write the phrase, "classic denial," 
I'll move on.

01:53.593 --> 01:57.091
So, about this woman 
for whom you have so little feeling 

01:57.262 --> 02:01.129
that you raced across town and burst 
into one of my sessions — is there 
any lingering resentment?

02:01.307 --> 02:03.346
Over what?!

02:06.769 --> 02:08.808
Well, she did leave at the altar.

02:08.979 --> 02:11.896
When you told her how that made you feel, 
was there anything you left unsaid?

02:14.650 --> 02:17.900
Any phrase or feeling 
you wished you had expressed to her?

02:20.905 --> 02:23.775
I'm making the assumption here 
that you did tell her how you felt.

02:25.283 --> 02:27.110
I sort of did.

02:28.327 --> 02:32.027
"Sort of" is another one of those phrases 
that just wants to go in my pad.

02:36.542 --> 02:38.664
I expressed my distaste for the way 
I'd been treated, yes.

02:38.835 --> 02:42.334
Frasier, she rejected you 
in the most debilitating way 
a man can be rejected.

02:42.505 --> 02:44.995
You've got to more than 
"sort of" tell her how that felt.

02:45.173 --> 02:50.511
Well, I can't just tell Diane 
how awful she made me feel now! 
It's a distant memory for her.  
I'd feel weak!

02:50.677 --> 02:52.800
You have no reason to feel weak.

02:52.971 --> 02:56.588
You've moved on in your life too.
You have a new career, new wealth, new success.

02:56.765 --> 02:59.849
You simply need closure in this one area.

03:00.935 --> 03:04.101
- You know, what you just said made a lot of sense.
- You're going to get closure.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.346
No, that business about my success!

03:06.523 --> 03:09.642
I tuned you out after that.

03:09.817 --> 03:16.019
I'm going to invite Diane over for dinner tonight, 
and I'm really gonna flaunt my success, 
really rub her nose in it!  

03:16.196 --> 03:20.063
That'll prove I'm not just some cast-aside 
that never got over her.  

03:21.159 --> 03:24.278
Niles, I know it's not psychologically sound.

03:24.453 --> 03:26.528
But we're still human.

03:26.704 --> 03:29.621
We have to do 
what feels good sometimes, don't we?

03:31.166 --> 03:33.573
I'd just like to be on the record 
as saying I'm against it.

03:33.751 --> 03:37.166
- Fine.
- You know the path that leads 
to peace with Diane and you're rejecting it.

03:37.337 --> 03:39.460
- Yes.
- I'm washing my hands of the entire matter.

03:39.631 --> 03:43.758
- Wouldn't miss it for the world though, would you?
- I'll be there at seven with a cheeky Bordeaux.

03:51.348 --> 03:54.681
No, no, no.  
Daphne, I was very specific about this.
The mayor's plaque goes on the piano...

03:54.850 --> 03:59.595
The Otis Klandenning "Man of the Year Award" 
goes right over here...

04:00.688 --> 04:05.432
And my jewel — my SeaBea — goes right here 
where she can't miss it!

04:06.109 --> 04:07.686
Hmm, that seems a bit subtle.

04:07.860 --> 04:12.236
- Why don't I just use this to serve the olives?
- Give me that!

04:15.533 --> 04:20.692
I wish someone would just tell me who this woman is, 
and why we're trying to impress the pants off her.

04:20.870 --> 04:24.949
She's a one-time Boston barmaid 
who had a nervous breakdown 
and ended up in a sanitorium, 

04:25.123 --> 04:27.661
where I met her, 
fell for her,..

04:27.834 --> 04:30.324
and then was so mercilessly rejected by her

04:31.128 --> 04:34.959
that to this day 
there is a sucking chest wound...

04:37.091 --> 04:39.628
...where once there dwelled a 
         heart!

04:47.140 --> 04:51.800
You remember my brother Niles, 
my father Martin, 
and this is his health-care worker, Daphne Moon.

04:53.561 --> 04:58.021
- What a tasteful abode.
- Well, it's modest in its way.

04:58.190 --> 05:02.056
No, that's what I like about it.
After the rambling beach house 
I've been living in,

05:02.234 --> 05:04.903
I'm ready for something smart and efficient.

05:08.447 --> 05:13.523
White wine, Diane?  
I'm pouring an '85 Montrachet 
La Guiche I purchased at auction.

05:13.701 --> 05:16.867
Oh, I always keep a bottle of that 
open myself.

05:19.748 --> 05:21.787
Hang this up!

05:23.584 --> 05:26.667
Well, Martin, it's been too long. 
How have you been?

05:26.836 --> 05:29.077
Well, my wife died, 
I got shot in the hip,

05:29.255 --> 05:33.999
and I had to move in with Frasier 
'cause I kept falling down in the shower.

05:36.051 --> 05:38.090
Well, you look wonderful!

05:39.179 --> 05:40.637
Yes, you do!

05:41.806 --> 05:44.213
That's the bad one.

05:48.311 --> 05:51.145
Niles, do you remember the last time 
I was in town and we dined together? 

05:51.313 --> 05:56.270
You had just started dating this woman — 
she was the queerest little creature. 

05:58.860 --> 06:03.188
She ate everyone's sorbet, and
then she had to lie down 
in the ladies' lounge

06:03.364 --> 06:06.862
while the coat-check girl 
massaged her abdomen!

06:12.162 --> 06:14.201
Oh, I hope I haven't put my foot in it.

06:14.372 --> 06:17.407
You and she didn't get married 
and live happily ever after, did you?

06:17.583 --> 06:19.824
No, can't say as we did.

06:22.753 --> 06:24.959
- Care for an olive?
- Oh, thank you.

06:25.130 --> 06:30.419
These are a Pyreenean taste treat!
They're handpicked and bottled 
by Andalusian monks!

06:30.592 --> 06:32.750
You can spit the pits in here.

06:42.393 --> 06:46.603
So, there I was, on the balcony 
of my Malibu beachhouse,

06:46.771 --> 06:48.810
when a pod of whales passed by.

06:48.981 --> 06:52.017
I knew I had to commune 
with these gentle giants,

06:52.192 --> 06:58.276
...so like a flash, I was on the beach, 
scrambling to my kayak.

06:59.489 --> 07:03.533
But cruel fortune interceded, 
when, not twenty yards offshore,

07:03.700 --> 07:08.077
I suddenly discovered myself 
entangled in an enormous bed of-of, um—

07:08.246 --> 07:10.036
- Sea kelp?
- Exactly right, sea kelp!

07:11.623 --> 07:14.956
Oh, that's funny — I thought he said 
"seek help."

07:21.672 --> 07:24.589
So, you haven't told us 
how you've come to be in Seattle.

07:24.758 --> 07:28.885
Oh, a small theater group has decided 
to produce a play I've written.

07:29.053 --> 07:34.675
- Which one?
- Oh, my most recent work.  
It's a sort of feminist odyssey, 
experimental in places,

07:34.849 --> 07:38.596
in tone akin to Saroyan, 
with a soupçon of Gide,

07:38.768 --> 07:41.769
and a hearty nod 
to Clifford Odets!

07:42.605 --> 07:44.763
I meant which theater?

07:46.149 --> 07:49.149
- Oh!  The Roundabout.
- That seems appropriate.

07:53.655 --> 07:57.568
You know, why don't you people 
just keep talking amongst yourselves? 
I will go and fetch the profiteroles.

07:57.741 --> 08:01.690
They were prepared 
by the hottest new pastry chef in... 
oh, what's the use?

08:04.913 --> 08:07.582
I'll help.
He always overpowders.

08:08.332 --> 08:14.203
Yeah, I'm sure Old Man Kennedy 
felt this kind of pride 
when his boys would go out 
and play touch football.

08:14.378 --> 08:18.458
Now, Frasier, you know her better than I.  
Is that what she looks like 
when she's writhing in envy?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.671
Oh, shut up.

08:22.843 --> 08:29.046
All right, I admit you were right.  
Before she leaves here tonight, 
I am going to tell her 
how much pain she made me feel.

08:30.265 --> 08:34.179
The savage truth this time — 
there will be no sugarcoating it!

08:34.352 --> 08:36.807
And yes, I am aware of the irony!

08:38.897 --> 08:42.099
Oh, it must be wonderful 
to see your words come to life like that.

08:42.274 --> 08:45.109
Oh yes.  It's a dream come true.

08:48.112 --> 08:50.603
- Diane, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.  Why?

08:50.781 --> 08:54.908
- Well, your cheek was kind of twitching.
- It was?

08:55.993 --> 08:59.906
- Oh well, it was probably fatigue.  
Where were we?
- Oh, I was asking about your play.

09:00.079 --> 09:02.949
- Oh, right!
- There it goes again, the twitch!

09:05.000 --> 09:10.040
That was either a very large twitch 
or a very small seizure.

09:11.254 --> 09:16.164
You know, I'm not sure how much 
I really want to talk 
about my play right now.

09:21.179 --> 09:23.218
Bad luck and all that!

09:24.389 --> 09:27.639
Yes, and we all know what a struggle it is

09:27.809 --> 09:30.513
to get Diane to talk about herself.

09:30.686 --> 09:32.761
Oh Frasier, you always could kid!

09:34.355 --> 09:36.394
How I miss that!

09:46.823 --> 09:50.072
Look, Diane, please, 
I-I really didn't mean anything by it. 
I'm sorry—

09:50.242 --> 09:54.737
It's not that!
It's my whole life, it's ruined!

09:54.912 --> 09:58.909
- Niles, could you please get her some water?
- Of course, of course.

09:59.082 --> 10:02.248
Oh, everything I told you tonight is a lie.

10:04.628 --> 10:06.834
I'm sorry for this.

10:07.922 --> 10:12.583
- Oh, I must look just awful.
- Your cheek stopped jumping.

10:17.137 --> 10:20.588
All right, now.  Tell me what happened.  
Was it about your play?

10:21.599 --> 10:23.638
There it goes again!

10:25.685 --> 10:27.724
Look, would you people please 
just give us some privacy?!

10:36.277 --> 10:38.684
All right now.  From the beginning.

10:38.862 --> 10:44.199
Well, it all started a few months ago 
when I lost my job.

10:44.366 --> 10:48.742
I'd been writing for 
"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman."

10:48.911 --> 10:52.659
I was on the set one day, 
and I was trying to show Jane Seymour

10:52.831 --> 10:56.779
the proper way to cauterize 
a wound with a branding iron,

10:56.959 --> 10:59.710
and I accidentally 
set her hair on fire.

11:03.672 --> 11:07.669
Well, from there 
it was a steady slide downhill.

11:07.842 --> 11:10.130
A two-year relationship ended.

11:10.302 --> 11:13.670
I lost the beach house,
friends stopped calling —

11:13.846 --> 11:17.795
the one bright spot 
was my play in Seattle.

11:18.892 --> 11:23.517
Well, I flew up here yesterday 
only to find that the backer 
was pulling out.

11:25.272 --> 11:29.979
I was so distraught 
I found myself wandering around the city 
in complete despair.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.977
It's then that like a ray of hope 
from heaven,

11:35.154 --> 11:38.487
I saw your smiling face 
on the side of a bus.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.619
And that's why I'm here today.

11:45.787 --> 11:49.570
You helped me the only other time 
I was this low.

11:49.748 --> 11:52.832
Frasier, I'm asking 
for your help again.

11:55.294 --> 11:57.417
Of course I'll help you, Diane.

11:59.756 --> 12:05.129
- Well, that was a bit scary.
- I'll say — watching someone 
go completely crackers like that.

12:07.261 --> 12:10.131
- What's the matter with you now?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

12:10.305 --> 12:12.428
Just suddenly missing my Maris.

12:17.811 --> 12:20.895
INTERPLAY

12:22.231 --> 12:25.979
My God, Niles, 
it's such a glorious day!
I walked all the way here.

12:26.151 --> 12:28.819
Thirty-two blocks, 
and Bruno Maglies be damned!

12:30.612 --> 12:36.234
Oh yes, I see the look, 
I know exactly what it means too. 
How could I very well say "no" to Diane? 
She came to me in crisis.

12:36.408 --> 12:39.658
Oh, excuse me, 
a double cappuccino, please, 
light cinnamon, 
thank you very much.

12:41.787 --> 12:44.953
Oh, you know, the change in Diane 
has really been quite gratifying.

12:45.123 --> 12:51.125
Dropped her off at the theater today, 
and there was a smile on her face 
that I haven't seen in...

12:51.711 --> 12:53.751
well, far too many years.

12:53.921 --> 12:57.005
Oh, I know what you're thinking. 
Where did she get the money to do the play?

12:57.174 --> 12:59.213
Well, she found a backer!

13:00.051 --> 13:02.090
It's tax deductible!

13:05.430 --> 13:09.593
Thank you.  
Oh, why don't you go ahead and say 
what you're thinking, Niles?  
That I'm falling for her again.

13:09.767 --> 13:14.344
"Well, you did bounce in here 
as though you were on top of the world, 
and babbling about her smile" 
— I just don't want to  hear it, Niles!

13:14.520 --> 13:18.564
I'm simply helping her 
to get back on her feet 
and out of my life as quickly as possible.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.973
No, I don't know 
how long it's going to take.

13:22.151 --> 13:24.439
Look, I said I don't know!

13:24.611 --> 13:29.189
Oh, really, Niles!  
Curse you, you are the most 
infuriating busybody!  
I'm not sitting with you.

13:37.538 --> 13:39.197
FOREPLAY

13:39.372 --> 13:41.530
It really is a lovely city.

13:42.625 --> 13:47.451
"Night — making all things dimly beautiful..."

13:47.628 --> 13:51.127
"...One veil over us both."
Cyrano?

13:52.215 --> 13:55.418
Yes.  Eleven years later, 
we're still on the same page.

13:55.593 --> 13:59.424
Frasier, these past few weeks, 
you've given so much of yourself to me.

13:59.596 --> 14:03.545
I want to give the one gift 
I have to bestow.

14:03.724 --> 14:08.052
I want you to be the first person 
to see my play.  
Will you come to dress rehearsal tonight?

14:08.227 --> 14:10.896
- Diane, I'd be honored.
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful!

14:11.563 --> 14:14.848
- Give me a second.
- Are you sure you're ready for this?

14:15.024 --> 14:19.566
Oh yes, it's time. 
Tonight, I bare myself to you.

14:23.155 --> 14:28.694
- Big step, Diane.
- Oh well, I have to say 
I'm a little nervous about it.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.816
But, barring any lighting 
or prop problems, 
the whole thing will be over 
in a couple of hours.

14:32.996 --> 14:35.830
Hello! 
People still in the house here!

14:39.584 --> 14:41.909
Meet me at the theater at seven...

14:42.086 --> 14:45.584
I don't know 
what I've done to deserve you.

14:55.054 --> 14:58.837
Listen, it's none of my business, 
but you're not falling 
for her again, are you?

14:59.808 --> 15:02.724
- What if I were?
- That woman dumped you at the altar.

15:02.893 --> 15:05.384
Oh, that was the old Diane.

15:05.562 --> 15:08.977
She no longer sees herself 
as the center of the universe.

15:09.148 --> 15:12.812
And I'm not the old Frasier 
anymore either.  People can change, Dad.

15:12.984 --> 15:17.977
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
Take me for instance.  
The old Martin would have said, 
"you're out of your mind.  

15:19.072 --> 15:23.733
I'd rather see you go gay 
and shack up with the punk who shot me 
than go off with her.

15:26.036 --> 15:29.700
I'd rather see you sewed up 
inside the body of a dead horse."

15:29.872 --> 15:33.999
But the new Martin just says, 
"Vivee a l'amour."

15:36.001 --> 15:40.212
The new Frasier 
resists the temptation 
to correct your French.

15:45.550 --> 15:48.716
Well, the stage is set, 
my players are prepared.

15:48.886 --> 15:54.721
So, without further ado, 
I give you "Rhapsody and Requiem,"

15:55.808 --> 15:58.927
a play by Diane Chambers.

16:08.442 --> 16:13.020
Boy, it sure is great 
having Mary Anne back. 
Just wasn't the same when she was gone.

16:13.196 --> 16:17.145
Yeah, well, you know, uh, 
recent studies at John Hopkins 
University revealed...

16:17.324 --> 16:23.325
that the expression "absence makes 
the heart grow fonder," is in actuality 
rooted in scientific bedrock.

16:23.495 --> 16:25.867
Yeah, so's your head.

16:26.039 --> 16:29.822
- Ease up there, Darla.
- Evenin', everybody.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.870
Hey there, Ned.
What would you say to a beer?

16:33.044 --> 16:36.626
What's a nice beer like you 
doing in a face like this?

16:41.759 --> 16:44.712
- Salutations, all.
- Hey there, Doc.  What can I get you?

16:44.886 --> 16:51.421
Ooh, a prickly choice, Stan. 
It reminds me of the one 
the 18th-century wit John Wilkes faced 
when asked by the Earl of Sandwich...

16:51.600 --> 16:54.849
whether he expected to die 
on the gallows or of the pox.

16:55.019 --> 16:59.312
"That depends, sir," he said, 
"on whether I choose to embrace 
your principles or your mistress."

17:02.400 --> 17:03.728
Evening, people.

17:11.198 --> 17:14.281
I pour beer down people's throats.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.194
I drink it.

17:20.329 --> 17:24.872
Our lives are empty.  
So what draws our feet here 
night after night?

17:30.504 --> 17:31.914
Well, I'm off.

17:33.381 --> 17:36.915
- See you anon, mi amore.
- You bet, honey.

17:38.552 --> 17:40.627
Hold it, stop!

17:42.304 --> 17:45.922
What kind of a kiss was that? 
You two are supposed to be in love!

17:46.099 --> 17:50.309
- Well, I didn't know how big you wanted it.
- Remember that kiss you gave me 
this morning?

17:50.477 --> 17:52.516
Like this one?

17:58.483 --> 18:01.152
That's the one.  OK, from the kiss!

18:02.236 --> 18:03.860
You bet, honey.

18:10.200 --> 18:15.324
Forgive me, Franklin. 
I suppose that was a tad inconsiderate.

18:15.496 --> 18:18.615
Quite all right.  A loving spirit 
like yours can't be bridled.

18:18.790 --> 18:24.744
- But I did leave you at the altar.
- No, you know I hold no ill-will 
toward you for that.

18:26.838 --> 18:32.709
Could we just stop for a second?
This whole getting-left-at-the-altar 
thing, I just don't know what 
I'm supposed to be feeling.

18:32.884 --> 18:36.501
I may be able to illuminate that for you!

18:40.223 --> 18:43.306
What you are feeling is that this woman 
has reached into your chest,

18:43.475 --> 18:49.180
plucked out your heart, 
and thrown it to her hell-hounds 
for a chew toy!

18:51.231 --> 18:55.098
And it's not the last time either!
Because that's what this woman is!  
She is the Devil!

18:55.276 --> 19:00.067
There's no use running away from her, 
because no matter how far you go, 
no matter how many years you let pass,

19:00.238 --> 19:04.448
you will never be completely 
out of reach of those bony fingers!

19:05.951 --> 19:11.536
So drink hearty, Franklin, and laugh! 
Because you have made a pact 
with Beelzebub!

19:11.705 --> 19:14.160
And her name is Mary Anne!

19:19.586 --> 19:22.871
AFTERPLAY

19:31.678 --> 19:34.382
- I thought we should talk.
- Well, yes, I think we should.

19:34.555 --> 19:38.089
- I tried to reach you at your home.
- I was driving around.

19:38.266 --> 19:43.722
I'm sorry if I in any way 
misled you about my feelings 
these last few weeks.

19:43.896 --> 19:47.513
You didn't. 
I think I misled myself.

19:47.690 --> 19:54.521
Well, at the very least 
I obviously owe you an apology 
for the first time that things 
went awry between us.

19:54.695 --> 19:58.277
- Oh, it's all right.
- No, it was a time in my life when...

19:58.448 --> 20:00.487
No, Diane, it isn't necessary.

20:00.658 --> 20:04.986
The things I said... 
well, they just needed saying. 

20:06.204 --> 20:08.777
Besides, I don't really feel 
all that harshly.

20:08.956 --> 20:13.083
...and in retrospect, 
I'm reasonably sure that yu are not 
the Devil...

20:15.628 --> 20:20.087
although he does have the power 
to assume pleasing shapes.

20:22.425 --> 20:26.172
Well, you should know 
I've decided to go back 
to Los Angeles.

20:26.344 --> 20:31.764
Watching the play tonight 
through fresh eyes, I... 
well, I just don't think it's ready.

20:32.849 --> 20:35.683
I'm sure things'll work out fine.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.974
Well, I think I've said 
what I came to say.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.275
Frasier, um, before you go, 
there's one last thing 
you could help me with,

20:46.443 --> 20:49.194
not that you haven't helped me 
a lot already.

20:49.361 --> 20:54.236
It's the last scene, where 
Franklin and Mary Anne say goodbye.

20:54.407 --> 20:56.980
It's never felt quite right to me.

20:57.159 --> 21:01.985
I'd like her to stand... 
oh, right about here

21:02.163 --> 21:07.238
...and tell him how much 
he's meant to her...

21:07.417 --> 21:11.283
and how she'll never forget him.

21:11.461 --> 21:17.130
How do you suppose... "Franklin" 
would respond to that?

21:22.219 --> 21:24.258
Well, I suppose he'd ...

21:25.347 --> 21:27.469
...tell her that he feels the same way.

21:28.724 --> 21:32.507
That she's touched him in a way 
she can never imagine...

21:32.686 --> 21:34.725
...and he's glad she was in his life.

21:37.439 --> 21:40.605
All that would be left 
would be the "goodbye."
How do you see that?

21:41.901 --> 21:46.941
Well, I suppose he could say, 
uh, "until we meet again," 

21:47.822 --> 21:50.063
probably certain that they never would.

21:51.575 --> 21:56.568
But mightn't there be a part of him 
that hopes they would?

21:56.745 --> 22:00.659
Oh, I suppose so, yes. 
All right, then, don't have him 
sum things up.

22:00.832 --> 22:05.789
Just let them say their goodbyes, 
and if their paths happen 
to cross again, so be it...

22:11.173 --> 22:15.632
- Goodbye, Mary Anne.
- Goodbye, Franklin.

22:15.801 --> 22:19.928
Oh yes, that's a perfect moment! 
Uncluttered by any extra words 
or phrases...

22:20.096 --> 22:22.135
Oh shoot, I've blown it!

22:24.141 --> 22:26.975
All right, let's try it again.

22:33.690 --> 22:35.349
Goodbye, Diane.

22:37.651 --> 22:39.690
Goodbye, Frasier.

22:54.122 --> 22:56.529
Force of habit.

22:59.459 --> 23:01.914
I've been doing it all week.
