WEBVTT

00:00.304 --> 00:01.958
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:02.002 --> 00:03.568
- Oh, lay-days!
- Ladies!

00:03.612 --> 00:06.049
Don't eat corn, gluten-free,
or high carb.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.051
Eats dairy-free, keto.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.574
Come on, Dave, take a seat.

00:09.618 --> 00:12.316
Any sane person should be
a little scared of Danielle.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.014
Oh, yes!

00:18.192 --> 00:20.107
I burned
the out of my finger.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.196
- It's pretty bad.
- Oh!

00:22.239 --> 00:24.067
All these different
preference lists would be

00:24.111 --> 00:26.417
hard enough with two hands, and
now I only have one good one.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.071
I'm in ----ing pain.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.594
Can we get some plates?

00:29.638 --> 00:31.292
Oh, my God.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.600
Need some help in the interior?

00:35.644 --> 00:38.081
I got this girl in quarantine,
we have an extra bed.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.388
I'm willing to give her
a shot for this charter.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.259
I'm adding someone.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.696
She is a deck stew, but she's
coming out to help interior.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.655
I have never worked interior.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.613
Everything will be new,
but you know...

00:48.657 --> 00:50.267
- Okay.
- Think on my feet kinda thing.

00:50.311 --> 00:51.747
Yeah.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.096
The staffing agency
thought maybe this could be

00:53.140 --> 00:54.489
an opportunity to help you out.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.362
Things need to be done properly,

00:58.406 --> 01:02.627
and now that we do have an
extra hand, there is no excuse.

01:02.671 --> 01:05.108
So, I don't wanna
have ranks anymore.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.370
Okay.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.068
Mat, this is your roomie.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.330
- Delaney.
- Nice to meet you.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.158
Management just called.

01:11.201 --> 01:14.509
We cannot allow cabin-sharing
between a male and a female.

01:14.552 --> 01:17.294
The liabilities are too high,
and the risk is too much.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.122
And Delaney stays,
the three girls are gonna

01:19.166 --> 01:20.558
have to go into
the three-bedroom cabin;

01:20.602 --> 01:22.125
I'll move in with Malia.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.084
David would go back
into Mat's cabin,

01:24.127 --> 01:27.087
and then Lloyd and
Mzi move into my cabin.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.392
For me, it seems
like it's causing

01:28.436 --> 01:30.090
more problems than it's worth.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.309
I'm here with a positive
attitude and hard work.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.137
Look, you can stay
till the end of the charter,

01:34.181 --> 01:36.052
- and we'll talk then.
- Okay.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.793
That looks nasty over there.

01:37.836 --> 01:40.143
Yeah, that's coming
straight for us.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.406
The minute you see the anchor,
we're gonna let it go again.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.105
Oh!
Holy sh--!

01:45.148 --> 01:46.758
Red on deck, red on deck.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.412
Ah!

02:08.563 --> 02:10.695
It's storming like nothing.

02:10.739 --> 02:13.350
Holy sh--.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.526
----ing crazy looking out there.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.137
Look at these waves.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.748
I'm scared, I want
outta this place.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.750
Deck crew, deck crew, Lexi.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.796
Holy sh--!

02:27.190 --> 02:28.800
Getting a little nervous.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.237
Lloyd, Lloyd, Lexi.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.415
It's wild.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.459
Ah!

02:38.245 --> 02:39.768
Holy sh--!

02:39.811 --> 02:41.857
This is gonna pass, I promise.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.641
Lloyd, Lloyd, Lexi.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.600
<i>Lexi, we are anchoring.</i>

02:45.643 --> 02:46.688
Come on.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.692
Red on deck, red on deck!

02:55.436 --> 02:56.785
Ah!

02:57.786 --> 02:59.570
You could drop the anchor.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.572
- Lloyd, are you okay?
- Yeah.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.487
Woo!

03:03.531 --> 03:04.706
Oh, sh--.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.578
Yeah.

03:07.622 --> 03:08.753
<i>Ready to drop.</i>

03:11.974 --> 03:13.671
Okay, deck crew's
moving the boat.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.282
I put those there--

03:17.806 --> 03:19.895
<i>...has bit.
A long stay, 11:00.</i>

03:19.938 --> 03:22.637
Okay, great, let's get Jake in.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.465
Yeah, I was asking if they had,

03:24.508 --> 03:26.684
like, a space where I could
have stashed them really quick.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.513
Well, you could bring
them to laundry.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.255
Holy sh--.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.257
While we're wet, we might
as well check the decks.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.519
Yeah.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.436
Oh.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.482
You have every right to
be stressed the out,

03:41.525 --> 03:43.310
- like, I, like...
- Like, that's all it is.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.528
- It's just all the other sh--.
- Yeah.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.443
Ow!

03:46.487 --> 03:49.229
I know it's hectic for you,
but it'd probably be easier

03:49.272 --> 03:51.579
for us to sail through
the next two charters.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.320
No, her work ethics great.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.669
It's not that,
it's like she's...

03:54.712 --> 03:56.497
The moving and stuff.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.673
Yeah, and then I'm worried
that if we do all of this

03:58.716 --> 04:00.718
and then she's, like, not...
because, you know,

04:00.762 --> 04:02.024
she does wanna be a deckhand,
so I get it.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.547
Like, she's in
a sh-- situation.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.809
Yeah.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.290
Moving six people around
for one person

04:07.334 --> 04:08.813
doesn't make sense to me,

04:08.857 --> 04:11.425
but denying help when
I've been asking for it

04:11.468 --> 04:12.948
also doesn't make sense.

04:12.991 --> 04:15.211
It makes me look like
a ----ing hypocrite.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.648
Like, I feel responsible
because it's my department

04:17.692 --> 04:20.390
that keeps
causing all this ----ing sh--

04:20.434 --> 04:21.870
for the rest of the crew.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.567
- Is she on break now?
- Yeah.

04:23.611 --> 04:27.354
Whatever I choose,
I'm gonna let somebody down.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.573
It's a lose-lose, basically.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.967
Like, somebody's gonna get hurt
and it's gonna be because of me.

04:32.010 --> 04:35.449
it, I might
as well just go work.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.929
<i>Captain Sandy, Katie.
What is your location?</i>

04:37.973 --> 04:39.322
On the bridge.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.716
- Okay, so...
- Thank you.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.370
What do you wanna do?
You wanna ride jet skis?

04:43.413 --> 04:44.675
We can't do that,
it's too windy.

04:44.719 --> 04:45.981
Oh, yeah, it's probably
way too windy.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.330
It's choppy.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.811
The sun's coming out a little.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.379
- Probably gonna cry.
- Why?

04:52.422 --> 04:55.686
So, I spoke to her, and, like,
I look like a total bitch,

04:55.730 --> 04:57.384
you know, but I was just
being honest with her.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.516
I was like, look, I brought
you on for good will,

04:59.560 --> 05:00.909
and even though, yeah,
it does help,

05:00.952 --> 05:03.346
I just worry that
it's gonna cause

05:03.390 --> 05:05.392
more sh-- than
it's worth, basically.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.351
Okay, so that's probably a
little bit too much soap, oops.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.831
And she's like,
"Well, that's not fair."

05:09.874 --> 05:11.093
And I'm like,
"It totally isn't fair."

05:11.136 --> 05:12.964
Like, that's such
a sh--ty thing.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.706
Hurting people, and
especially if it's, like,

05:15.750 --> 05:18.666
something I've done
to somebody, is, like,

05:18.709 --> 05:19.884
the biggest trigger for me.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.583
I think because
when I feel pain,

05:22.626 --> 05:25.368
I feel it so deeply
that it, like...

05:25.412 --> 05:27.544
it's like, how am
I gonna get past this?

05:27.588 --> 05:28.893
Like, it just hurts.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.721
My whole body aches that,

05:30.765 --> 05:33.898
like, I ----ing struggle
with that, like, so much.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.552
She wants to stay, right?

05:35.596 --> 05:36.640
Yes, she does,
and that's why I feel bad.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.555
Right.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.340
Like, I look like a total bitch
because I'm just, like, look...

05:40.383 --> 05:41.384
- You're not. Look...
- But it's just, like...

05:41.428 --> 05:42.385
You're just being honest, Katie.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.995
Yeah.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.736
Like, you know what,
if you're fine in the interior

05:45.780 --> 05:47.608
and you don't need the help,
you can let her go.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.610
I promise, she will be fine.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.612
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.004
Okay, go get some rest.

05:53.048 --> 05:55.485
- No, I have to serve lunch.
- Oh.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.358
Ow, ow, ow.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.489
How was your break?

06:02.579 --> 06:03.928
- What?
- I know.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.366
If I do a good job,
she really has no leg

06:06.409 --> 06:07.454
to stand on to, like,
get rid of me.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.107
Yeah.

06:09.151 --> 06:11.501
You know, my mom was adopted,
so a big part of her life

06:11.545 --> 06:13.938
has always been
helping foster kids.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.897
So, she taught
me acceptance

06:15.940 --> 06:17.638
and, like, the more,
the merrier.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.553
So, when I joined the boat
I was under the mentality

06:19.596 --> 06:21.642
that other people felt like
that, and people would be,

06:21.685 --> 06:24.601
like, yeah, like, a new friend,
have her join, this is epic.

06:24.645 --> 06:27.822
That's not exactly what
happened, but I wanna be here.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.998
If I need to prove to Katie
that I'm an asset to the team,

06:30.041 --> 06:31.695
then I'll do it.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.784
I'm just gonna do a good job.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.396
Yes, girl, let's slay together.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.530
Hey, what are you
doing on your phone?

06:42.837 --> 06:43.838
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:45.535 --> 06:46.884
Quite a body.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.106
Quite.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.673
Wow, that's... yeah.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.544
Delaney has quite the Instagram.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.111
Look how good I look in this,

06:56.154 --> 07:00.071
and by the way, look how
good I look in this.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.117
No, I wasn't...

07:02.160 --> 07:05.555
No!
Shh, don't do that!

07:08.776 --> 07:10.125
No, man, stop it!

07:14.521 --> 07:15.696
- I don't get it.
- This is hot.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.132
You're hot.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.742
Courtney, I'll swap out
with you for a second.

07:18.786 --> 07:19.917
- Want me to go up?
- Yeah...

07:21.789 --> 07:24.661
Who doesn't wanna eat
Mexican for lunch?

07:24.705 --> 07:26.054
Yeah, it's taco day.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.491
Every meal, I've been
picking a cuisine

07:28.535 --> 07:30.450
and then work backwards
from there.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.800
Give them something unhealthy,
give them something healthy,

07:32.843 --> 07:34.889
give them something
gluten-free, something fried,

07:34.932 --> 07:36.151
something grilled.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.587
I've had a perfect
season so far,

07:37.631 --> 07:39.502
and I just wanna
keep it that way.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.895
Can we get
three shots of tequila?

07:40.938 --> 07:42.636
Three shots of tequila,
of course.

07:43.637 --> 07:44.638
Hey.

07:45.639 --> 07:46.727
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

07:46.770 --> 07:47.902
There's a ripping current, so...

07:47.945 --> 07:49.686
No, I know.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.035
So I know today's not
the biggest water sports day,

07:51.079 --> 07:52.515
but we can come up
with other fun things.

07:52.559 --> 07:53.951
We've got beer pong, flip cup.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.564
- Yes!
- Yeah.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.217
Oh, yes!

07:59.261 --> 08:01.089
We should set the fire alarm
off and have the guys run up

08:01.132 --> 08:02.917
and be, like, "Is there a fire?"

08:02.960 --> 08:04.919
Yes, oh, my God, yes.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.529
You guys wanna get lunch?

08:06.573 --> 08:09.706
Lunch is ready.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.316
Today's going solid.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.015
I didn't even put out
a fire with my hand.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.800
We have gluten-free
crumbed chicken legs.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.022
Mexican style prawns.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.023
Do the shrimp have butter?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.024
No butter in the shrimp.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.939
Thank you.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.202
All right, it obviously sucks
that they can't do water sports.

08:27.245 --> 08:28.638
Yeah.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.554
We have to make today
fun for them.

08:31.598 --> 08:34.165
How do you feel about dressing
up in a fireman's outfit?

08:36.167 --> 08:37.908
Do a little dance,
bring them down,

08:37.952 --> 08:39.214
play beer pong with them.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.258
Leave you to it?

08:40.302 --> 08:41.259
You ready?

08:41.303 --> 08:42.609
Yeah.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.700
Yeah, I love guacamole.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.092
Did you do any of
that ironing yet?

08:48.136 --> 08:50.225
- These ones are done.
- All right.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.238
This was the best meal
of the whole trip.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.326
You say that every time.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.327
This was the best.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.328
I was trying to diet.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.590
None of that here.

09:07.634 --> 09:08.722
<i>Are we gonna do the fire alarm?</i>

09:08.765 --> 09:11.768
Oh!

09:13.988 --> 09:16.120
Muster stations!

09:16.164 --> 09:17.165
That's the alarm!

09:17.208 --> 09:18.558
That's literally the alarm!

09:32.397 --> 09:34.095
Come on, David!

09:34.138 --> 09:35.705
I'm not Magic Mike.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.707
I think that's well
established, yeah.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.056
Woo!

09:39.100 --> 09:40.928
Woo-hoo!

09:42.451 --> 09:43.626
Damn!

09:43.670 --> 09:44.975
I wish I had champagne.

09:48.109 --> 09:51.025
She loves it.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.680
Woo!

09:54.898 --> 09:56.160
Okay, let me in there.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.727
Look at this!

10:02.079 --> 10:03.385
You guys are the best.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.865
That was the best surprise.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.083
- Loved it!
- Oh, my God.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.435
- Yes!
- We're ready.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.654
Great!

10:11.698 --> 10:13.134
What are you all gonna drink?

10:13.177 --> 10:15.005
- We'll drink water.
- I'm not gonna be sober.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.964
Oh, David, you're trying to
get us blackout for dinner.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.095
Well, I'm gonna go to bed soon,
so it's fine for me.

10:19.836 --> 10:22.404
- Oh, what'd you get?
- Don't worry about it.

10:22.447 --> 10:23.884
Hello, ladies.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.320
Do we wanna do 8:00
again for dinner?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.672
Yeah, so I'm gonna let the chef
know 8:00 for dinner.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.760
Thank you so much.

10:30.804 --> 10:31.935
- You ready to play?
- Yeah!

10:31.979 --> 10:35.199
- Ah!
- Woo!

10:37.114 --> 10:38.899
That...

10:38.942 --> 10:42.685
My forearm is way nicer
than yours... look at that.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.776
You can't even concentrate.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.082
Oh, my God.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.084
Throw it!

10:53.000 --> 10:56.351
I'm the number one physical
education teacher in America.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.701
Would you like to enroll
in one of my classes?

10:58.745 --> 10:59.833
Yes.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.315
When the weather's sh--,

11:04.359 --> 11:05.926
we all have to turn
into entertainers.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.015
What the is she doing?

11:08.058 --> 11:11.192
But I'm not actually pimping
out my deck crew, so...

11:11.235 --> 11:14.151
Woo, 69, 69, I swallow.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.112
You can go take a cold shower.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.418
Let me see what's going on.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.333
It's been six years
with no ring.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.813
I don't swallow.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.249
We gotta work on you.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.990
David, would you propose
to me on charter?

11:27.034 --> 11:28.296
No, but he's not,
because you don't swallow.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.298
- Oh!
- We could work around things.

11:30.341 --> 11:33.214
Wow, now say
goodbye to your fireman.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.913
Coming up...

11:36.957 --> 11:38.001
Sorry.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.960
I've got this girl in my cabin,

11:40.003 --> 11:43.006
and I'm stuck in this musty
chief officer's cabin.

11:43.050 --> 11:46.227
I blame Lexi for us
bringing on a fourth stew

11:46.270 --> 11:48.185
who's now taking my
----ing cabin.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.796
This is ridiculous.

11:52.624 --> 11:56.411
It's been six years with
no ring, so I don't swallow.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.935
David, would you put a ring
on it after this charter?

11:58.979 --> 12:02.069
He's not gonna let you,
because you don't swallow.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.418
Oh, wow.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.074
No, I just gotta get these
guys in their epaulettes.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.555
- No.
- It's been a pleasure.

12:10.599 --> 12:11.600
See you later.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.210
Get in the hot tub.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.169
Yikes.
Okay.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.344
How's your hand?

12:16.387 --> 12:17.998
Disgusting, wanna look at it?

12:18.041 --> 12:20.478
Kinda and kinda not, but kinda.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.958
Oh.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.395
Yo, yo, I want my cabin back
tomorrow.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.658
You're gonna sleep in
Marten's cabin for the charter.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.486
- Share with Marten.
- Yeah.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.010
It's messing up our tip.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.273
I... shut the up.

12:32.316 --> 12:33.361
I'm ready.
We're doing this.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.928
- Yes.
- Well done, guys.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.451
Bit rocky at times,
but we got through it.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.063
It's been a wild one.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.499
These girls are loose.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.936
I think they had a good time.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.112
No, absolutely do not
tell them that.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.678
They love tacos.

12:46.722 --> 12:47.941
Thanks, babe.

12:47.984 --> 12:48.942
- Not a problem.
- I love you.

12:48.985 --> 12:49.986
Thank you.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.295
- How you doing, bro?
- Suffering.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.166
You'll be okay.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.559
- Lexi?
- Yeah.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.561
- What time's dinner?
- It's at 8:00.

12:59.604 --> 13:00.997
Ooh!

13:01.041 --> 13:02.520
- Court.
- Yes?

13:02.564 --> 13:04.000
Look at you, doing all
this service and bartending.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.002
Oh, stop it... thanks.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.526
I'm proud of myself,
how far I've come this season.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.659
Like, five charters ago
I literally hadn't really been

13:10.702 --> 13:12.313
out of, like, laundry
and housekeeping,

13:12.356 --> 13:14.663
and now I feel like I can,
like, handle anything.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.186
I need water.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.068
Five years?

13:31.375 --> 13:33.334
It's very similar to on
"Gossip Girl,"

13:33.377 --> 13:35.336
but people have
a perception, like, oh,

13:35.379 --> 13:39.079
these are wealthy families, and
this is their pretty daughter.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.950
There's a lot more
that goes into it,

13:40.994 --> 13:43.997
like seven years of etiquette
training, and general manners,

13:44.040 --> 13:45.476
like count swear words
on a first date.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.348
I count under the table,
and if a guy gets

13:47.391 --> 13:49.219
past nine swear words, he
does not get a second date.

13:51.569 --> 13:52.744
<i>Delaney or Lexi.</i>

13:52.788 --> 13:54.224
<i>Hey, go ahead for Delaney.</i>

13:54.268 --> 13:55.573
<i>The double cabin is free.</i>

13:55.617 --> 13:57.227
<i>Copy, on our way.</i>

13:57.271 --> 14:00.535
Whenever you guys are ready,
we can sit at the table.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.058
You wanna drink
wine with dinner?

14:02.102 --> 14:03.146
Yes, please.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.408
I'll take a Moscow mule.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.975
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.412
I'd love a chilled water
in a martini glass,

14:08.456 --> 14:10.588
with some sugar on the rim.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.329
I can do that.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.332
So, this big one, I'm gonna
do two bolts or one?

14:15.376 --> 14:16.594
No, do it...

14:16.638 --> 14:18.118
Oh this is
filled with water!

14:18.161 --> 14:19.728
Whew.

14:19.771 --> 14:23.079
Martini glass with sugar on
the rim and water inside.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.733
What the [bleep]?

14:27.127 --> 14:29.129
Beds, it's literally not
rocket science.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.653
Some people do
a stewardessing course,

14:31.696 --> 14:33.698
and I find that to be,
like, really idiotic.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.440
- Classic pesto.
- Cheers.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.747
Yep.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.402
So, you have a classic pizza
and a pesto pizza.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.620
May I have ranch, please?

14:42.664 --> 14:45.493
- Yes.
- I can't eat it without.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.147
Are these not gluten-free
or gluten-free?

14:47.190 --> 14:48.409
Not gluten-free.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.063
It's an Italian
hodgepodge night.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.629
I'm doing different
kinds of pizzas,

14:51.673 --> 14:53.501
pastas with everything
under the sun,

14:53.544 --> 14:56.983
all because these
preferences are insane.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.636
Deconstructed bolognaise.

14:58.680 --> 14:59.681
Thank you.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.335
Pizza with ranch.

15:01.378 --> 15:02.727
Are you waiting on gluten-free?

15:02.771 --> 15:04.686
She's not doing family-style.

15:04.729 --> 15:07.602
The lunch, I didn't like
family-style.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.386
For dinner, like,
if you could just fix me,

15:09.430 --> 15:11.040
- like, a dish for dinner...
- That's fine.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.782
I will pass on the message.

15:13.825 --> 15:14.783
- Thank you, yeah.
- We've been eating, sorry.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.480
Mm, I'm good.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.743
So, we have grilled chicken
and chicken Milanese,

15:18.787 --> 15:20.354
which is all gluten-free.

15:20.397 --> 15:24.053
May I have red sauce
without meat?

15:24.097 --> 15:25.620
- Just tomato?
- Yeah, of course.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.056
There's just tomato sauce.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.362
I told you, I only
like white sauce.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.190
Oh.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.669
They want sauce that you can
do without meat for the pasta.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.323
I can do a marinara real quick.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.542
Just tuck it like this.

15:37.545 --> 15:38.676
Cook made this up for you.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.330
Holy crap, thank you so much.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.506
Krystal, did you get your entrée
you ordered way earlier?

15:42.550 --> 15:45.074
No, I just...

15:45.118 --> 15:47.381
I'll take some off
the family-style.

15:47.424 --> 15:48.730
- I'm joking.
- I don't like...

15:48.773 --> 15:51.341
- I'm joking.
- Eating family-style.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.342
Thanks.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.735
Are they happy?

15:53.778 --> 15:55.302
I don't know,
bro, they're so fussy.

15:55.345 --> 15:58.174
The fish is fantastic.
This is five stars.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.610
Katie, Katie, Lexi.
We're done.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.090
Copy.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.309
She didn't wanna do
family-style.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.527
- Ashley?
- She wanted her own entrée.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.094
Do you wanna go
check on them, Court?

16:05.138 --> 16:06.574
Yeah.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.097
I'm actually just shocked
about it, though.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.316
She ate some.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.187
Does anybody need another drink?

16:11.231 --> 16:12.884
You're all good?

16:12.928 --> 16:14.538
Cool.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.236
Not bad.

16:27.508 --> 16:28.465
Yeah, sure.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.814
Aw, this is so nice.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.862
Lex, just be careful
with the beds.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.559
Make sure they're really tight.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.431
I've just gone and, like,
tightened them all.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.347
And one of the bathrooms
didn't have a bathmat.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.653
Oh, that was
what's her name, Deloni.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.699
- Yeah.
- I'll let her know.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.571
And yeah, just you
can go to bed.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.184
<i>Hey, go ahead for Delaney.</i>

16:51.227 --> 16:53.360
<i>Meet me in lower guest, I
just wanna show you one thing.</i>

16:53.403 --> 16:55.449
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.233
You know, I just hate days
like this,

16:57.277 --> 16:59.105
because it just feels like
they drag on for deck crew.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.629
It's so long, versus
a full day of water sports,

17:01.672 --> 17:03.196
- it's just gone like that.
- Yeah.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.763
That has makeup on it.
We will hide it for now.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.243
Okay, change it tomorrow?

17:07.287 --> 17:08.331
- Yeah, we'll change it tomorrow.
- Okay.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.463
Noted.

17:09.506 --> 17:10.855
That's it.
Dream team.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.770
All right, I'm outta here.

17:12.814 --> 17:13.858
Yeah, sleep well.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.208
Okay, good night.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.731
How are you?

17:16.774 --> 17:19.560
Honestly, yo, yo...

17:22.867 --> 17:24.347
It makes no sense,
her being here.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.349
David, I want a shot from you.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.177
- Okay.
- And you only, yeah.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.439
She got my room.

17:29.483 --> 17:30.745
I work 18 hours a day;
she gets breaks.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.312
Like, what is she doing here?

17:32.355 --> 17:34.140
We've actually got another
girl on because

17:34.183 --> 17:36.185
Lexi couldn't do
her ----ing job,

17:36.229 --> 17:38.492
and now they're both doing
the same job together.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.624
They are basically
DeLexi right now.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.670
Like, that is what's happening.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.280
They're just merging into one.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.239
We can't do two more trips
with this girl.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.545
It's bothering me.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.633
Hey...

17:49.677 --> 17:51.505
The best tequila shot I've had.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.724
All right, David,
I'll see you in the morning.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.378
- Long day.
- Night.

17:55.422 --> 17:56.727
Night. Sleep well.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.430
Sleep tight.

18:06.998 --> 18:10.306
- Hey.
- Hey, sorry.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.394
Just gotta grab something.
Thank you.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.744
I've got this girl in my cabin,

18:13.788 --> 18:16.530
and I'm stuck in this
musty chief officer's cabin.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.445
See you in the morning.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.708
I blame Lexi for not
pulling her weight,

18:20.751 --> 18:22.536
for us bringing on a fourth stew

18:22.579 --> 18:24.712
who's now taken
my ----ing cabin.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.061
This is ridiculous.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.758
It's bullsh--.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.849
Coming up...

18:31.893 --> 18:33.242
You've just gotta be
a cold bitch.

18:33.286 --> 18:34.635
I'll teach you the way.

18:34.678 --> 18:35.636
I can't just buck her off.

18:35.679 --> 18:36.724
Why?

18:37.725 --> 18:38.769
----ing A.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.825
- Good morning.
- Morning.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.528
I think I might put
that next to my bed.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.183
Hey, go ahead for Delaney.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.707
Hey, Deloni, can you come
to main deck pantry?

19:03.751 --> 19:05.405
Yep, I'll be right there.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.146
Do you know what's really funny?

19:07.189 --> 19:08.582
On the radio
between those two...

19:08.625 --> 19:09.626
Yeah?

19:09.670 --> 19:11.019
She keeps calling her "Deloni,"

19:11.062 --> 19:13.195
but she keeps responding,
"Go for Delaney."

19:13.239 --> 19:14.631
- Yeah.
- All day.

19:14.675 --> 19:15.676
Okay.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.025
Deloni, Deloni, Lexi.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.505
Go ahead for Delaney.

19:18.548 --> 19:21.551
It's really hard to say.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.640
Katie wants
that whole tablecloth

19:23.684 --> 19:25.381
that's on the ironing board,
she wants that ironed

19:25.425 --> 19:27.644
for the beach barbeque,
so maybe you should turn laundry

19:27.688 --> 19:28.776
and get that ironed right away.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.038
Sure.

19:35.522 --> 19:36.914
Where is everybody?

19:36.958 --> 19:38.046
Sleeping.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.830
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.529
This is beautiful weather.
We gotta take advantage of that.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.661
How's my anxiety girl?

19:44.705 --> 19:46.402
Anxiety.

19:50.493 --> 19:51.538
Why?

19:51.581 --> 19:52.756
She's actually doing all right,

19:52.800 --> 19:54.976
and I'm sick of
thinking about it.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.065
I don't think
he realizes

19:57.108 --> 19:59.023
how hard this
actually is for me.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.896
Like, I'm not a bitchy person,
I'm not a bitchy chief stew.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.072
Like, I know he means well,

20:04.115 --> 20:07.031
or I mean, I don't know,
maybe he doesn't.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.861
But, like, right now,
he just needs to stop.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.693
Good morning.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.086
Yeah, sure.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.783
- I would just love an Americano.
- Sure.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.524
Dave, Dave, you're free
to open the transom.

20:21.568 --> 20:22.873
Copy.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.267
All right, let's try
this bad boy.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.747
Morning.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.792
Would you like an
English breakfast tea?

20:28.836 --> 20:30.272
Yes, please.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.578
Should we slide a
second fender through here now,

20:31.621 --> 20:32.796
so it's out and up?

20:32.840 --> 20:34.276
Okay.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.539
He's gonna do an eggs
Benedict for a special.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.498
Yeah, I'll do what he was
gonna make, that sounds good.

20:38.541 --> 20:39.934
Yeah? Sure.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.158
Can I get a piece of bacon?

20:47.202 --> 20:49.030
- Yes, you can.
- Yas!

20:51.728 --> 20:52.773
Hell, yeah.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.644
So, I've lengthened this,

20:54.688 --> 20:56.037
because there's obviously
the gap, we've lifted it.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.038
So, it's just there to
fill the gap.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.300
I like your idea.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.910
The slide's been
a little bit weak.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.999
Oh, my gosh.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.479
There's been a hole.

21:03.523 --> 21:04.915
But once we've raised
it up that much,

21:04.959 --> 21:06.613
it really changes
the angle of the slide.

21:06.656 --> 21:07.701
I started as a deck engineer.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.616
Hell, yeah, that looks fun.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.531
So when I'm looking at something
I'll break it up and think,

21:11.574 --> 21:12.967
can I make it any better.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.708
Should be a
lot more fun this time.

21:14.751 --> 21:15.926
Yeah, boi.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.798
<i>David, David, Malia.</i>

21:17.841 --> 21:18.973
<i>Let's get the jet-skis off
the slide right away.</i>

21:19.016 --> 21:20.061
Copy.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.628
Stage one out.

21:23.238 --> 21:24.848
Beach picnic.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.676
What the can
I do for these ladies?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.287
"No onions or mushrooms, ever."

21:28.330 --> 21:30.201
She eats like a child,
doesn't she?

21:30.245 --> 21:31.768
Yeah.

21:35.772 --> 21:36.947
Okay.

21:39.602 --> 21:40.560
Yeah, hectic.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.213
Is that all right for this?

21:42.257 --> 21:43.780
No, it's... you're folding
everything in thirds.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.826
I got these, you can
iron some of that out.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.001
- Okay.
- I'll fold.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.132
Here you go.

21:48.176 --> 21:49.308
Bon appétit.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.874
Start loading?

21:50.918 --> 21:52.093
Yes, and then you and
I are gonna check out

21:52.136 --> 21:53.224
this beach picnic.

21:54.878 --> 21:57.228
Hi, could we, like,
put a whole bunch of dish...

21:57.272 --> 21:58.882
like, dish soap on
those and, like...

21:58.926 --> 22:00.797
like, make it
a slip-and-slide, or...

22:00.841 --> 22:02.582
On the... yeah...

22:02.625 --> 22:04.061
I didn't know that's what
you were talking about.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.585
You can do it, it's just
not gonna be very fun.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.241
Yeah, let's do that.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.721
You're in charge, Lloyd,
while I'm off the boat, okay?

22:11.765 --> 22:13.201
Okay, sweet.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.946
So, 2:00, 2:30-ish,
shall we say?

22:18.989 --> 22:20.687
- That'd be great.
- That, and slides and stuff?

22:20.730 --> 22:21.688
Yeah, yeah, of course.

22:21.731 --> 22:22.689
Yeah.

22:22.732 --> 22:25.039
Like, we need to go fast.

22:25.082 --> 22:28.042
Beach picnics are just difficult
to pull off in the Med.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.826
You get these, like,
rocky sands.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.872
You know, on this boat
we've got one tender

22:31.915 --> 22:33.221
to shuttle everything
in and out.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.919
Logistically, they can
just be a nightmare.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.878
But at this point in the season,

22:37.921 --> 22:40.359
like, deck crew
is a full-on machine.

22:42.448 --> 22:46.277
Sweet.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.760
Do you mind if get,
like, a bloody Mary?

22:50.804 --> 22:52.675
Yeah, I'll bring it to you,
I'll find you.

22:52.719 --> 22:54.285
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

22:56.331 --> 22:57.245
This is the life.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.943
Spicy bloody Marys... ooh.

22:59.987 --> 23:02.293
I'll do a big salad with
bacon, avocado,

23:02.337 --> 23:04.078
tomatoes, everything
deconstructed.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.862
All right.

23:05.906 --> 23:07.734
And then should I do, like,
a gluten-free pesto pasta?

23:07.777 --> 23:09.388
Oh, my God.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.390
I feel like my mind
is so preoccupied

23:11.433 --> 23:13.653
with this Delaney situation.

23:13.696 --> 23:16.612
Like, I just wanna do my job,
because it's just consuming me.

23:16.656 --> 23:17.657
You wanna get the slide now?

23:17.700 --> 23:19.310
Oh, yeah.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.399
You just need to grab onto this
handle and pull yourself up.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.792
- Do it.
- Woo!

23:22.836 --> 23:25.665
- Ah!
- Ah, don't put that on me!

23:25.708 --> 23:26.970
Oh, my God.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.668
Oh, my God!

23:29.495 --> 23:31.366
Two guests in the water.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.759
The slide looks great, Malia.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.413
Yeah, it was Lloyd's idea.

23:34.456 --> 23:38.112
- Oh!
- Ah!

23:38.155 --> 23:40.027
You wanna jump?

23:40.070 --> 23:41.898
Okay.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.639
Oh, you wanna wear it while
you're doing that? Oh, boss.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.818
I'd start plating,
because it's nearly 2:30.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.909
It kind of sounds weird.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.085
It's not going fast.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.347
it is sinking.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.045
That WaveRunner...

23:58.088 --> 23:59.307
look at that WaveRunner,
how it's out of the water.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.831
Lean to your right,
to your right.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.920
Oh sh--.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.052
Oh, my God.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.357
- Ah!
- Oh, God!

24:06.401 --> 24:07.794
Coming up...

24:07.837 --> 24:09.099
It's the last supper.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.971
He really has done
such a good job so far.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.189
It's about a four of a 10.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.930
- Dayum.
- A four out of 10?

24:13.974 --> 24:16.237
I just have high standards
when it comes to food.

24:19.849 --> 24:22.809
Oh sh--.
It is sinking.

24:22.852 --> 24:23.940
Lean onto your right.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.772
Just come straight,
just come straight.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.339
That WaveRunner...

24:31.382 --> 24:32.949
look at that WaveRunner
how it's out of the water.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.125
I'm not getting back
on with her.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.170
I didn't mean to!

24:37.998 --> 24:40.479
All right, let me
put you on this one.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.915
I'll take a look at it.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.266
Lloyd, Lloyd, Malia.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.615
Can you come
to the stern, please?

24:46.659 --> 24:48.878
Copy that.

24:48.922 --> 24:51.141
Oh, seeing the jet-ski,
how low it's sitting,

24:51.185 --> 24:54.493
I'm like sh--, did someone
forget to put the plugs in?

24:54.536 --> 24:57.496
But, like, surely not,
because that's, like...

24:57.539 --> 25:00.107
All right, the jet-ski
is not looking right.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.457
- Yeah.
- Not cool.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.458
Get all your stuff ready.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.981
Yeah, it's ready.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.593
Lexi, Lexi, Katie,
ready to rock and roll.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.116
Copy.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.552
Love you guys,
thank you so much.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.119
- Okay.
- I've lost weight.

25:12.162 --> 25:13.163
These shorts, like,
won't stay up now.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.252
Don't lose your booty, Dave!

25:15.296 --> 25:17.167
Oh, no, no,
that's gonna stay, always.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.212
Were the bungs in?

25:18.255 --> 25:19.561
Checked them.

25:19.605 --> 25:20.997
She might have just
sucked up a plastic bag.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.346
I'm gonna lounge on the back.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.044
Okay, all good.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.524
Thank you.

25:29.266 --> 25:32.356
I just asked Dave, but
that's looking like he didn't.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.357
That's...

25:33.401 --> 25:34.576
Okay.

25:36.404 --> 25:37.579
I'll just jump
under there and check?

25:37.623 --> 25:38.624
Yeah.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.365
Malia, so...

25:43.629 --> 25:45.152
I don't...

25:45.195 --> 25:46.849
I don't know if that's
the problem.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.372
- So, apparently...
- It's filling up with water.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.337
Yeah.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.557
I'm not stupid.
She's covering.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.559
I love that they
have each other's back,

26:00.602 --> 26:03.126
but in no way does
Malia get to dictate

26:03.170 --> 26:05.607
what is told to me and
what isn't told to me.

26:05.651 --> 26:06.695
I need the trust.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.436
Yeah, I'll talk to them.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.401
That wasn't smart.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.577
Why are these different colors?

26:18.620 --> 26:20.187
Okay.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.188
If you're a chief stew,
I feel like you should

26:21.231 --> 26:23.059
be on your A game.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.974
But I think she's distracted
with the whole Deloni situation,

26:25.018 --> 26:28.151
and so she's missing all these
basic, common sense things.

26:35.550 --> 26:38.161
- They weren't tight?
- No.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.510
- Is there a plastic bag?
- No.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.078
Mistakes happen, but it sucks.

26:42.122 --> 26:45.473
It's in front of charter
clients and Captain Sandy.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.346
David, so this jet-ski
is filling up with water.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.044
Yeah.

26:51.087 --> 26:54.003
I don't think the
bungs were put in properly.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.265
I checked them.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.703
You checked them before
you put them in?

26:57.746 --> 26:59.661
No, after.

26:59.705 --> 27:03.534
I've never actually had a
near jet-ski sink from bungs,

27:03.578 --> 27:05.536
but now it definitely
won't happen again.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.016
- Always check that.
- Yeah.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.017
Cool.

27:08.061 --> 27:09.715
Oh, the flies are landing.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.760
I know, I shouldn't have taken
the thing off, I was premature.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.675
Are you guys heading
to the beach shortly?

27:13.719 --> 27:15.285
- We're ready when you are.
- Yeah, I think we're ready.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.591
- Let's roll.
- Have a great time, guys.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.593
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.377
Beach picnic!

27:20.421 --> 27:21.770
Hey!

27:21.814 --> 27:23.293
Okay, round of tequila.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.555
Welcome!

27:24.599 --> 27:26.688
- I will escort you over.
- Perfect.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.430
It's the sinking monster.

27:29.473 --> 27:30.605
So pretty, guys.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.738
Mzi, start packing
away the slide.

27:36.785 --> 27:39.701
The weather is really
just participating.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.485
There's a lot of water in there.

27:41.529 --> 27:43.096
Come up.

27:43.139 --> 27:44.793
I'll take a tequila shot
whenever you go back.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.229
Got you.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.840
- I'll do a vodka soda.
- Okay.

27:47.883 --> 27:50.016
This is like my job to a T.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.018
Like, you fake a smile
and pretend

27:52.061 --> 27:55.282
like everything's really
good when it's not... it's not.

27:55.325 --> 27:56.631
Cheers, girls.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.720
Okay, can you reach the bungs?

28:06.597 --> 28:07.773
Is it still coming out?

28:07.816 --> 28:10.036
Yeah, there's a sh---ton.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.779
It's still coming.

28:13.822 --> 28:16.477
That is... wow, that had
a lot of water in it.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.394
Like some pasta salad?

28:20.437 --> 28:22.222
- It's pesto pasta.
- No.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.484
I double-dare you to eat a carb.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.094
A hundred bucks.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.318
Are you allergic?

28:32.493 --> 28:33.799
Okay.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.461
- Yeah?
- Oh, sorry.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.378
Hey.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.166
- There you are, mate.
- Lovely. Thank you.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.082
Copy.

28:56.865 --> 28:57.866
That's a big cloud.

28:57.910 --> 28:58.867
Yeah, it is.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.434
Did you guys bring blankets?

29:00.477 --> 29:01.478
- No.
- This is a whole thing.

29:01.522 --> 29:02.697
- We're cold.
- Okay.

29:02.741 --> 29:03.872
- Is it time to go?
- We can leave.

29:03.916 --> 29:04.873
All right.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.788
Courtney, Courtney, Katie,

29:06.832 --> 29:08.224
the guests are gonna be
on their way back soon.

29:08.268 --> 29:09.617
Yeah, copy that, it's all good.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.532
They have to unpack all this,
I feel horrible.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.142
No, you don't.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.405
- Here's your decorations.
- Dresses!

29:15.449 --> 29:17.756
Holy crap, it got really
cold really fast.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.193
It did.

29:20.236 --> 29:21.803
- Well, that was quick.
- Yeah.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.587
I'm like, you guys
requested this, you know?

29:23.631 --> 29:25.807
Hey, girl, uniform for tonight.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.504
Would you just be able to,
like, steam them?

29:27.548 --> 29:29.202
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.551
How was lunch?

29:30.594 --> 29:32.466
This weighs 50 pounds more,
we ate so much.

29:32.509 --> 29:33.772
That's what I like to hear.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.643
Yes, thank you.

29:35.686 --> 29:36.818
Whend do you guys thinking that
you're gonna ready for tonight?

29:36.862 --> 29:38.341
Come out early?

29:39.734 --> 29:42.693
- Oh, the jet-ski?
- It was the bungs.

29:42.737 --> 29:45.218
He thought they were in,
but it wasn't.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.480
All right, thanks.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.223
The only way water gets
in something

29:50.266 --> 29:53.182
is if there's a hole, and a
bag doesn't create a hole.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.663
You know, even though Malia
doesn't see this as a lie,

29:55.706 --> 29:57.273
she's just
covering for her team,

29:57.317 --> 29:59.623
it's not doing her any justice,

29:59.667 --> 30:03.149
because it's planting a little
seed of doubt in my mind.

30:04.324 --> 30:05.804
All right, Mzi,
get up here, thank you.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.806
Make sure you rinse off first.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.634
- Hello.
- Hi.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.332
I don't suppose you've got
number four, have you?

30:12.375 --> 30:13.724
- Look how much...
- Yeah.

30:13.768 --> 30:14.813
-...is on there?
- I see the oil on there.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.466
Slim fit, so...

30:20.427 --> 30:21.515
Right on.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.865
Mother, I missed you

30:23.909 --> 30:26.476
So, the decorations
are down there,

30:26.520 --> 30:27.869
the dresses and
whatever also came.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.740
- Yeah.
- I gave it to Delaney to steam.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.699
You know when I think
of a white party,

30:31.742 --> 30:33.657
it's definitely one of
the, like, more glamorous,

30:33.701 --> 30:36.965
so, like, glitzy,
fun things you can do.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.837
Is this a joke?

30:39.881 --> 30:42.579
It's so not..

30:42.623 --> 30:44.625
For some reason, our
provisioner decided

30:44.668 --> 30:47.236
that we were gonna
go down the Amish theme.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.195
- It's huge.
- Can you find the waist tie?

30:49.238 --> 30:50.413
What is that for?

30:50.457 --> 30:51.762
It's a white party tonight,

30:51.806 --> 30:54.896
and I asked for dresses,
and this is what I got.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.028
I'm just gonna cut this.

30:56.071 --> 30:59.379
- Shall I cut this?
- Oh, my God.

30:59.422 --> 31:02.469
This white dress is
definitely not a vibe.

31:02.512 --> 31:03.992
Really, but should I cut it?

31:04.036 --> 31:05.602
Yeah, right here.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.300
- Katie's cut hers.
- These are yours, dude.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.475
Oh, fantastic.

31:08.518 --> 31:09.737
Tell me how short you want it.

31:09.780 --> 31:10.912
I'd rather it be long.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.480
Just try to keep
as still as possible.

31:17.614 --> 31:20.879
Oh, my God, I think I cut
yours too short, holy

31:20.922 --> 31:22.750
Why did I trust you?

31:24.534 --> 31:26.362
Does my hair look super greasy?

31:26.406 --> 31:28.016
No, you look really pretty.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.800
That's not what I asked.

31:31.498 --> 31:32.455
Yo, Katie, what do
you think, 8:30?

31:32.499 --> 31:33.761
Eight-thirty.

31:33.804 --> 31:34.849
I'm gonna do Asian,
like, sushi.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.459
Asian...

31:36.503 --> 31:37.765
There's only so many different
foods you can do

31:37.808 --> 31:39.898
when you have this many
preference sheets.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.509
Luckily, this is not
a two-week charter,

31:42.552 --> 31:44.424
or else I'd be running
out of themes.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.599
Double job?

31:45.642 --> 31:47.818
Yeah, go two,
make it special.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.777
I feel like we need more
stuff going on out here.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.693
Should I just come out serving
like this, and not say anything?

31:55.043 --> 31:57.480
Oh, damn, daddy!

31:57.524 --> 31:59.874
- Is my all-white working?
- It's working, babes.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.571
Are we...
are we getting ready to...

32:01.615 --> 32:03.269
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

32:07.664 --> 32:08.665
Do you want me to keep doing
laundry, or is there

32:08.709 --> 32:09.971
anything I can help you with?

32:10.015 --> 32:11.799
Is Lexi cleaning up crew mess?

32:11.842 --> 32:13.670
I didn't see that,
but I can go do that.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.368
All right, yeah.

32:15.411 --> 32:16.804
I'd love to get coffee.

32:16.847 --> 32:18.023
Come on, we're gonna be late.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.981
If I was early,
they'd be worried.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.421
My ----ing finger, dude.

32:25.465 --> 32:28.076
What's your vibe on
people changing cabins?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.860
I'm very neutral ground.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.427
She wants to stay,
this is the problem.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.125
Lexi wants her
to stay, because...

32:33.168 --> 32:34.778
What, because they're
best mates now?

32:34.822 --> 32:36.998
No, because she's lazy.

32:37.042 --> 32:39.000
You guys better be on point
when I need your help.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.046
Right, we're ready to roll.

32:41.089 --> 32:43.787
Put the rice on the outside,
since this is a white party.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.572
Mat, every time,
you're phenomenal.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.400
Oh.

32:47.443 --> 32:48.531
That looks all right.

32:49.750 --> 32:50.751
Hello!

32:50.794 --> 32:51.970
So pretty out here.

32:52.013 --> 32:53.449
- Is it raining?
- Clouds.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.016
Oh, wow,
that happened quickly.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.498
Oh, my gosh,
you look so beautiful.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.587
<i>Deck crew, deck crew, just a
head's up... it's raining.</i>

33:00.630 --> 33:02.023
- Copy, thank you.
- That's really good.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.503
All right, it's raining,
and we have all white.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.941
- We've gotta go put covers on.
- I'd better go.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.464
Oh, my God.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.858
Oh, yikes.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.164
Oh sh--.

33:12.207 --> 33:13.469
- Wow, it's really raining.
- Yeah.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.036
It's the last supper.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.082
He really has done such
a good job so far, though.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.735
The food's been really good.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.523
- It's...
- Oh, dayum.

33:23.566 --> 33:24.872
For you, a four out of 10?

33:24.915 --> 33:26.178
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.918
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.492
Wow, it's really raining.

33:36.536 --> 33:37.798
It's the last supper.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.626
He really has done
such a good job so far.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.758
It's about a four of a 10
on a Yelp review.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.064
- Dayum.
- A four out of 10?

33:43.108 --> 33:45.284
Yeah.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.155
I requested an entrée.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.549
Like, the food's been
really good for me.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.290
We're so many different food...

33:51.333 --> 33:53.553
Chicken fingers, Michelin star.

33:53.596 --> 33:54.989
He can't cook a hundred things.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.512
Yeah, no, I understand.

33:59.298 --> 34:01.126
Lloyd, you're soaked.
Do you have another shirt?

34:01.169 --> 34:02.127
No, I'll be all right.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.215
- All right.
- Cheers.

34:03.258 --> 34:06.000
<i>Lexi and Delaney?</i>

34:06.044 --> 34:07.001
<i>Go ahead.</i>

34:07.045 --> 34:08.698
All cabins are free.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.700
- Copy.
- Copy.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.572
Yeah, all right, let's
plate the sashimi first.

34:12.615 --> 34:14.139
You're gonna do bao buns.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.749
They're gonna be like
little sandwiches, all right?

34:15.792 --> 34:17.577
So, just, like, a piece in each.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.578
Yeah.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.754
And then a piece of lettuce.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.321
All right,
so Thai-style chicken satay.

34:22.364 --> 34:23.800
Oh yeah.

34:23.844 --> 34:25.150
Should I put ponzu
on this, or...

34:25.193 --> 34:26.890
I wouldn't, for that
----ing lady,

34:26.934 --> 34:27.891
because it'll probably
have soy in it, right?

34:27.935 --> 34:29.197
Oh.

34:30.633 --> 34:34.942
- So, we have tuna sashimi.
- Yum!

34:34.985 --> 34:38.815
Thai satay chicken, and we have
a Vietnamese vermicelli salad.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.121
Yum!

34:40.165 --> 34:41.818
That looks delicious.
That's my meal.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.733
What size towel are we
putting on that little thing

34:43.777 --> 34:45.039
next to the toilet?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.737
- The hand towel.
- Okay.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.090
Delaney's a very fast learner,
smart,

34:52.133 --> 34:54.135
gets the point,
knows what to do.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.877
If I say do something,
she's like, "Okay, I'll do it,"

34:56.920 --> 34:58.270
and I love that about her.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.794
Oh, they ----ed
this room up today.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.883
So, you could imagine
when we didn't have you.

35:02.926 --> 35:04.580
It took long.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.845
Those look nice, eh?

35:08.889 --> 35:10.760
Yo, do you want to attempt
to do some of these, Lloyd?

35:10.804 --> 35:11.805
Yeah.

35:11.848 --> 35:12.806
That's mayonnaise, right?

35:12.849 --> 35:14.068
I can ask for you.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.330
I'll just ask him.

35:15.374 --> 35:18.725
Oh, that is soaked.

35:18.768 --> 35:19.943
Is there mayo on the bao buns?

35:19.987 --> 35:21.336
Yeah.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.729
Just do one without.

35:22.772 --> 35:24.644
So, this is without mayonnaise.

35:24.687 --> 35:26.254
Okay.

35:26.298 --> 35:29.866
Sashimi, tuna and cucumber,
and tuna, cucumber, and avo.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.217
We have cucumber,
avo, and salmon.

35:32.260 --> 35:35.959
We've got salmon and cucumber
rolls, and sashimi.

35:36.003 --> 35:36.960
Do you want some more
tuna, Krystal?

35:37.004 --> 35:38.788
No.

35:38.832 --> 35:40.660
As soon as cucumber touches
something, it's destroyed.

35:40.703 --> 35:41.791
- Wow.
- Really?

35:41.835 --> 35:43.184
I'm 11.5 out of 10.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.751
- Yeah!
- You rocked it with me.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.318
You did, like,
you're soaking wet.

35:46.361 --> 35:47.319
Yeah, bra!

35:47.362 --> 35:49.190
I literally had...

35:49.234 --> 35:51.671
it was pouring with rain,
so I'm just absolutely drenched.

35:51.714 --> 35:52.889
I thought...

35:52.933 --> 35:54.978
I thought he was
profusely sweating

35:55.022 --> 35:58.286
from the pressure of
the cucumber rolls.

35:58.330 --> 36:00.114
His nipples were showing.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.290
Thank you so much for coming
right here and doing that.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.771
I would have been stressed,
like, getting stuff out on time.

36:04.814 --> 36:06.381
- Yo, are they happy?
- Yeah, they're real happy.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.469
Seriously?

36:07.513 --> 36:08.862
You've really outdone yourself.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.739
Everyone just be
helping all the people.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.792
The plates in the cupboard
are filthy.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.881
Who's responsible
for putting that crusty plate

36:27.924 --> 36:29.187
back in the cupboard?

36:29.230 --> 36:30.275
- I don't know.
- Well, fire them.

36:30.318 --> 36:31.972
Ugh.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.106
I'm just being lazy.

36:40.763 --> 36:41.938
Whew.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.157
I need a tea.

36:53.472 --> 36:55.125
Yeah, but, like, you know,
she's gonna wanna stay.

36:55.169 --> 36:57.215
She made that very clear.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.044
All right.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.003
I'm just putting
up my hands like this.

37:03.046 --> 37:04.309
Like, whatever.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.006
It's just all these
little factors

37:06.049 --> 37:08.356
that are now just, like,
piling up on me.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.271
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.446
Is the vibe okay?

37:11.490 --> 37:13.753
It seems a bit...

37:13.796 --> 37:15.798
I day-worked on a 70-meter.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.278
How are we going down here?

37:17.322 --> 37:18.758
Good.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.021
Trying to get some
of these towels out.

37:21.064 --> 37:23.023
We have all this to steam treat.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.766
Mm-hmm.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.204
Oh, yeah, apart from that.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.207
I'm going to my room.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.078
Good night.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.430
Should put alcohol in it.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.569
Sleep tight.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.790
- Good night.
- Night, guys.

37:50.833 --> 37:51.921
That's gonna go in the dryer,
that's gonna go in the dryers,

37:51.965 --> 37:53.314
and I have two washers open.

37:53.358 --> 37:54.359
So, I'm gonna start
steam-treating these

37:54.402 --> 37:55.447
so I can get these in.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.449
Mm-hmm.

37:57.492 --> 37:59.886
Katie, I know you don't
wanna hear what I'm gonna say,

37:59.929 --> 38:01.148
so I shouldn't
even say it, right?

38:01.191 --> 38:02.410
What are you gonna say?

38:02.454 --> 38:03.585
I don't want that girl
to be here.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.108
I know that.

38:05.152 --> 38:07.023
If one person can
cook for 20 people,

38:07.067 --> 38:08.547
three girls can do the interior.

38:13.029 --> 38:15.075
Six people changing their
cabins with two trips left,

38:15.118 --> 38:17.033
to share money with
someone who doesn't, like...

38:17.077 --> 38:18.992
it makes no sense.

38:19.035 --> 38:21.908
I love Katie, she's my favorite
person I've ever worked with,

38:21.951 --> 38:24.127
but Katie's weakness
as a chief stew

38:24.171 --> 38:25.912
is being too
nice and considerate

38:25.955 --> 38:27.522
of other people's feelings.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.350
It's not possible
to make everyone happy,

38:29.394 --> 38:32.353
and she just needs to be the
boss and make some decisions.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.137
I want my ----ing room back.

38:34.181 --> 38:36.139
- Should I quit a third time?
- Should I say I'll quit?

38:36.183 --> 38:37.837
Coco, let's walk together.

38:37.880 --> 38:41.319
It's already caused
so much sh-- with the crew.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.842
----ing hell.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.932
Coming up...

38:45.975 --> 38:47.499
Delaney, Katie wants
you to see her.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.109
Take a seat.

38:49.152 --> 38:52.068
I want my cabin back tomorrow.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.377
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.118
I'm just seeing
if you needed anything.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.299
Sure.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.219
Okay, do you want me to get one?

39:12.262 --> 39:13.568
- Okay.
- The whole thing?

39:13.612 --> 39:15.178
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.362
- Good evening.
- Hi.

39:26.233 --> 39:27.277
You're not gonna stay
for the show?

39:27.321 --> 39:28.583
What's the show?

39:28.627 --> 39:30.106
Ooh!

39:30.150 --> 39:34.502
I heard it was getting'
hot in here.

39:44.556 --> 39:46.253
Oh!

39:47.254 --> 39:48.690
Well done!

39:48.734 --> 39:50.431
Giving the people
what they want, hey?

39:54.174 --> 39:55.480
What's your slogan?

40:11.844 --> 40:15.369
Helping all the people
with all the things.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.153
I'll vote for you.

40:17.197 --> 40:20.069
I don't even know what
mayor is, and I'm not...

40:20.113 --> 40:21.462
I can't vote,
because I'm not American.

40:21.506 --> 40:22.724
But if I was American...

40:25.727 --> 40:27.468
Everybody can go to bed now.

40:30.863 --> 40:32.386
Okay, good night.

40:56.279 --> 40:58.630
One, two, three.

41:00.806 --> 41:03.069
Come in.

41:03.112 --> 41:04.766
I come with gifts.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.202
Oh, thank you.

41:08.422 --> 41:09.379
Okay.

41:09.423 --> 41:11.207
We're gonna be roomies?

41:11.251 --> 41:12.644
You wanna be roomies?

41:12.687 --> 41:14.341
I mean, I don't have
a problem moving in.

41:14.384 --> 41:16.299
It's three girls in one cabin,
two weeks.

41:16.343 --> 41:17.387
It's not that bad.

41:17.431 --> 41:18.824
So, cabin arrangements.

41:18.867 --> 41:21.522
- We have to move six people.
- Yeah.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.350
People aren't happy about it.

41:23.393 --> 41:26.527
People are really voicing
that to me, and I'm just...

41:26.571 --> 41:28.224
Well, it's up to you.

41:28.268 --> 41:30.226
I just don't know.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.577
If you're fine in the interior
and you don't need the help,

41:32.620 --> 41:34.579
just say "Thank you for helping
us out with this charter."

41:34.622 --> 41:37.146
I just feel bad, like, asking...

41:37.190 --> 41:38.583
just being like, cool,
thank you, see ya later,

41:38.626 --> 41:39.888
- you know, and...
- Well, don't feel bad.

41:39.932 --> 41:41.455
- This was a fill-in.
- Mm-hmm.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.761
This wasn't
a permanent position.

41:42.804 --> 41:44.458
Yeah.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.243
I need to allow Katie
to learn from her decisions.

41:47.287 --> 41:48.549
You're not always gonna
be popular,

41:48.593 --> 41:50.508
but you always have
to make the decision

41:50.551 --> 41:52.248
what's right for the boat.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.902
Woman up, make a decision,
and go have a conversation.

41:53.946 --> 41:55.730
Yeah.

41:55.774 --> 41:58.516
And be ready for the backlash,
because there will be some.

41:58.559 --> 41:59.821
Yeah.

42:03.782 --> 42:05.784
What was the room
situation originally?

42:05.827 --> 42:08.264
I was with Malia and
Katie was with Courtney.

42:08.308 --> 42:09.439
What was... what...

42:09.483 --> 42:11.572
We got into, like,
a tiny argument.

42:11.616 --> 42:14.619
You're a ----ing bosun,
stand the down!

42:14.662 --> 42:16.621
I mean, we get along well now,
everyone gets along.

42:16.664 --> 42:18.231
Yeah.

42:21.321 --> 42:24.498
At his point, I'm not listening
to any other crewmember,

42:24.542 --> 42:26.195
I'm not taking
aboard anything else.

42:26.239 --> 42:28.371
I know what everyone thinks,
I'm not ----ing stupid.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.286
They've said it to me
this whole trip.

42:30.330 --> 42:33.942
But at the same time, I really,
really, really don't want him

42:33.986 --> 42:35.683
to lose his sh--
and quit again.

42:35.727 --> 42:38.294
Ultimately, it's my decision,
it falls on my lap,

42:38.338 --> 42:41.471
and look, if this blows up
in my face, then that's on me.

42:45.911 --> 42:47.652
Go ahead.

42:47.695 --> 42:50.393
Can you tell Delaney to see me
in the main salon quickly?

42:50.437 --> 42:51.656
All right, I'll tell her.

42:51.699 --> 42:53.658
Delaney, Katie wants
you to see her.

42:53.701 --> 42:55.529
Did she say why?

42:55.573 --> 42:56.661
It's probably some sort
of meeting about moving cabins

42:56.704 --> 42:57.705
or something, I don't know.

42:57.749 --> 42:59.228
I'll take over and iron it.

43:03.276 --> 43:04.625
- Hey.
- Take a seat.

43:04.669 --> 43:06.279
Okay.

43:06.322 --> 43:07.889
I want my cabin back tomorrow.

43:07.933 --> 43:09.456
Um...

43:13.852 --> 43:15.418
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:15.462 --> 43:17.290
Tomorrow you guys
have a day off.

43:17.333 --> 43:19.640
Ah!

43:19.684 --> 43:21.860
- Whoa!
- Woo!

43:21.903 --> 43:23.339
Epic.

43:23.383 --> 43:24.689
Oh, my God!

43:24.732 --> 43:26.604
I feel like I've needed
this for so long.

43:26.647 --> 43:29.737
It ----ing cleans my soul, if
I still have one at this point.

43:29.781 --> 43:31.391
Coco needs dance.

43:31.434 --> 43:33.872
Come on, Z!

43:33.915 --> 43:35.264
Whoa!

43:35.308 --> 43:37.005
Yeah, Courtney!

43:37.049 --> 43:38.616
Aw, Mzi, you are so sweet.

43:38.659 --> 43:41.619
Ooh!

43:41.662 --> 43:43.316
No one ever puts
him in his place.

43:43.359 --> 43:44.926
He's a low hanging chef.

43:44.970 --> 43:46.711
He's wack, and nobody,
like, checks you.

43:46.754 --> 43:48.756
I've never disliked
someone more in my life.

43:48.800 --> 43:51.280
The feeling's mutual.

43:51.324 --> 43:53.369
You're a bad human.

43:53.413 --> 43:56.242
If this wasn't on camera,
I would have smacked your ass.

43:56.285 --> 43:57.417
There you go, you've got
a real-ass bitch.

43:57.460 --> 43:58.940
You are a hateful girl.

44:03.423 --> 44:04.946
Oh, my God.
