WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:06.440
Surprise!

00:06.540 --> 00:07.675
What is that?

00:07.775 --> 00:09.777
It's freedom.
Now that we're buying

00:09.877 --> 00:11.112
Kenny Rogers' half
of the restaurant,

00:11.212 --> 00:12.580
we can do
whatever the heck we want.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.049
Also, we're switching back to
one-ply in the bathrooms.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.450
Mm, I don't know...

00:16.550 --> 00:18.819
We'll keep a roll of two-ply
in the register for me and you.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.921
No,
not the toilet paper.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.391
I don't know about buying back
Kenny's share of the restaurant.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.059
What do you mean?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.260
I thought
we talked about this.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.895
I thought you went down
to the notary

00:27.995 --> 00:29.230
and got the papers signed.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.665
I was going to, and then I hit
that long light on 5th

00:31.765 --> 00:32.866
and I started debating,

00:32.966 --> 00:34.368
do we want to spend that kind of
money right now?

00:34.468 --> 00:36.770
Maybe we should find another
partner to buy Kenny's half.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.705
Share the risk.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.207
Share the profits,
you mean.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.975
Kenny's giving us his half
for pennies on the dollar.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.812
It's a great deal.
Hmm. You're right.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.780
Mm-hmm.
I'll add that
to the pro column.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.219
Pro --
I own the whole restaurant.

00:51.319 --> 00:55.256
Con --
I own the whole restaurant.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.691
You just wrote the same thing
down twice.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.761
Tricky, isn't it, how the same
thing can be good or bad?

01:00.861 --> 01:02.096
This hasn't been
very helpful.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.165
Louis,
you always do this.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.699
You question
and over-analyze

01:05.799 --> 01:07.968
and then you miss out
on a great opportunity

01:08.068 --> 01:09.303
because you can't
make up your mind.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.139
Well, I like to measure twice,
cut once.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.206
Nothing's wrong with that.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.509
No. Dumb.
Me, I'm a woman of action.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.011
You have to act first
and then apologize later.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.180
Like I have learned to do.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.514
You never apologize.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.650
I would
if I had ever been wrong.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.685
Listen, Louis,
I know for a fact

01:24.785 --> 01:26.454
that we should buy back
the restaurant.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.788
How can you be so sure?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.623
Madame Xing foretold it.

01:29.723 --> 01:30.924
Your psychic?

01:31.024 --> 01:32.726
She's never
steered me wrong.

01:32.826 --> 01:36.797
Hey, a lobster tank!
Fun!

01:36.897 --> 01:39.467
Lobsters all piled
on top of each other.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.603
It's sad, actually.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.639
I'm gonna go lie down.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.511
* Fresh off the boat

01:50.611 --> 01:52.146
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:52.246 --> 01:54.515
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:54.615 --> 01:55.816
* Fresh off the boat

01:55.916 --> 01:58.085
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:58.186 --> 01:59.620
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:59.720 --> 02:02.290
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:02.390 --> 02:04.725
We've got to agree
on something.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.627
What about Tommy Boy?

02:12.766 --> 02:14.335
Please.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.836
Multiplicity.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.672
Eddie, whatever you do,

02:18.772 --> 02:20.174
don't turn it to
Regis and Kathie Lee...

02:20.274 --> 02:21.309
Don't worry.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.976
...which I gave up
for 40 days of Lent

02:23.076 --> 02:24.278
to replicate the sacrifice

02:24.378 --> 02:26.680
of Jesus' 40-day trip
into the desert.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.616
Here we go.
Bible Boy is back.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.518
My least favorite
time of the year.

02:30.618 --> 02:34.688
I forgive you, brothers.
Love the sinners, hate the sin.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.557
Louis, I just talked
to Madame Xing

02:36.657 --> 02:39.026
and she told me another reason
why we should buy back

02:39.126 --> 02:40.928
Kenny Rogers' half
of the restaurant --

02:41.028 --> 02:45.466
I faced the exact same dilemma
in a past life.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.269
Could we not bring reincarnation
into this, please?

02:48.369 --> 02:52.240
Xing says I was a cartographer
in the Northwest Passage

02:52.340 --> 02:54.442
after
the Louisiana Purchase.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.211
I could have bought some pelts
from a local tribe,

02:57.311 --> 03:00.548
but I hesitated
and I froze to death.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.516
Don't make the same mistake
I did.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.652
Yeah, but what does any of this
have to do with the restaurant?

03:04.752 --> 03:06.119
Oh, I think
it's pretty clear.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.055
The restaurant
is our pelts.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.358
You need to stop hesitating
and buy it back

03:10.458 --> 03:12.326
so we don't get iced out
of a great deal.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.535
We are not making any big
decisions in our current life

03:21.635 --> 03:24.538
based on something Xing said
you did in a past life.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.074
I can't wait
till I'm reincarnated.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.376
I know who
I'm coming back as.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.843
The RZA.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.245
* Yeah

03:32.680 --> 03:35.749
Damn, Dave, these are the best
ants-on-a-log I ever had.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.850
Thanks, Eddie RZA.

03:36.950 --> 03:37.985
Come on, Brian.
What's up, man?

03:38.085 --> 03:39.720
You're acting like Antarctica
over here.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.655
Get your ass in the pool.
It's heated.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.391
Chlorine
makes my skin itch.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.593
Hey, yo, Ho-Ho!

03:46.394 --> 03:49.763
Drain the pool
and fill it up with meatballs.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.031
The saucy ones.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.633
Hell, yeah, Eddie RZA.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.067
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.904
That's not
how reincarnation works.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.773
I studied all the religions
before enrolling into Jesus U.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.642
Here comes the seminar.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.910
Every time we die,

04:03.010 --> 04:04.678
our consciousness is reborn
into another form.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.214
Each life is an opportunity
to improve ourselves.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.350
If you do, your spirit
transcends higher

04:09.450 --> 04:11.218
until you reach
spiritual liberation.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.455
And I have improved
through all my lives.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.625
That's how I became the perfect
being you see before you.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.126
That's bold.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.260
I know.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.396
In my next life,
I plan on achieving

04:22.496 --> 04:25.466
my ultimate
spiritual form --

04:25.566 --> 04:27.635
morning mist.

04:27.735 --> 04:31.238
That's why I know we should
buy back the restaurant.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.940
I learned it
three lives ago

04:33.040 --> 04:35.208
when I should have
bought those beaver skins.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.077
All right, listen,
I agree with you.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.712
We should buy back
the restaurant.

04:38.812 --> 04:39.980
Yes!

04:40.080 --> 04:41.449
It takes you a while, Louis,
but you finally get there.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.917
Not because of
any vision Madame Xing had.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.286
Because I called Silvia
at Union Savings

04:46.387 --> 04:47.955
and had her
run the numbers.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.089
They're too good to pass up.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.724
It doesn't make sense
not to buy it.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.126
So, Silvia is
your Madame Xing.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.995
No, Silvia is
a professional

04:55.095 --> 04:56.964
working in
an accredited industry.

04:57.064 --> 05:00.901
She uses math. She has a CPA.
She graduated from FSU.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.603
Okay, Louis.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.938
Okay.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.477
Okay, I need you to sign,
initial these,

05:09.577 --> 05:12.513
roll your thumb through
some ink, and we'll be done.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.649
Very unhygienic.
That's why I brought my own ink.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.120
We don't know if some pedophile
co-signed for a van.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.023
Lorenzo, what do you
think I should do?

05:24.592 --> 05:25.726
Yes, what's your opinion
on this?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.260
Should I buy the other half of
the restaurant?

05:27.361 --> 05:28.662
Well, who owns it now?

05:28.762 --> 05:31.131
Louis,
we decided this already.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.934
Pee or get off
the toilet.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.969
I sit 'cause I don't like
having my back to the door

05:36.069 --> 05:37.104
when I'm exposed.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.171
I won't tell.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.707
I'm just saying,
this is a big decision.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.141
Maybe we should
sleep on it.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.877
We just woke up from sleep!
It's morning!

05:43.977 --> 05:45.379
I'm sorry,
but I'm holding off.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.347
-Ohh!
-No thumbs today, Lorenzo.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.553
What happened to
all the lobsters?

05:52.653 --> 05:55.322
AMY: Matthew? Aren't you
supposed to be at work?

05:55.423 --> 05:56.390
It's my day off!

05:56.490 --> 05:57.725
I thought
that was Thursday.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.059
-I'm sick!
-Watch it!

05:59.159 --> 06:01.128
As soon as Inspector Gadget
gets out of here,

06:01.228 --> 06:02.863
I'm gonna drive you guys
all to the Gulf.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.798
Except you.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.767
You, I'm gonna keep.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.806
Evan, cover your eyes and ears.
We're gonna watch Baywatch.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.576
Sorry, you can't. I'm taping
Regis and Kathie Lee.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.546
I plan to catch up on all the
episodes I miss once Lent ends.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.013
Doesn't seem like
much of a sacrifice

06:20.113 --> 06:21.749
if you're gonna
watch the episodes eventually.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.784
The shows will be irrelevant
by then.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.419
That's the sacrifice.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.520
So now we have to suffer

06:26.620 --> 06:28.221
so you can feel like
you're superior to us?

06:28.321 --> 06:30.190
Not superior,
just better.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.061
Ugh! I cannot take
40 days of this.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.596
Lent Evan is the worst.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.264
We need to
take him down a peg.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.867
I don't know. I think I'm done
with all that stuff.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.101
I'm maturing.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.136
You farted into a Ziploc bag
this morning

06:43.236 --> 06:45.305
and put it in the freezer
to see if it would freeze.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.874
Oh, yeah, that's right.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.209
Yeah, cool,
let's mess with Evan.

06:49.309 --> 06:54.648
**

06:54.748 --> 06:55.783
Hey.

06:55.883 --> 06:59.352
Louis, I understand
you've had some trouble

06:59.453 --> 07:02.389
making a decision
and I've been pushing you.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.294
I know you're impulsive

07:07.394 --> 07:09.062
and I appreciate you
coming to apologize --

07:09.162 --> 07:11.899
Oh, no. Hey.
No one is apologizing.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.602
What? How do --
You aren't?

07:14.702 --> 07:18.238
No! I found someone else
to push you instead.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.441
I flew in Madame Xing
from D.C.!

07:21.542 --> 07:24.244
She was 10 minutes late
picking me up at the airport.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.579
But I had a vision
she would be.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.315
So, I had a quick cigar
outside the terminal.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.383
She'll give you a reading
and tell you

07:30.484 --> 07:33.186
how many lives you've spent
trapped by indecision

07:33.286 --> 07:35.689
so you can finally
overcome your weakness.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.665
You paid to fly your psychic in
to give me a reading?

07:44.765 --> 07:47.134
Of course not.
I used our credit card points.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.769
I was gonna use those
to take the family

07:48.869 --> 07:50.604
to either Alaska
or Hawaii.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.272
You've been debating that trip
for years.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.507
If you had made a decision,

07:53.607 --> 07:56.510
then I wouldn't have the free
miles to fly her out here.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.145
Unbelievable!

07:58.245 --> 07:59.813
Louis, I'm just
doing this to help you

07:59.913 --> 08:02.516
see that buying back
the restaurant is a good idea.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.052
Jessica,
can I have some ice water?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.587
I have
the cigar breath.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.089
Of course, Madame Xing.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.961
Don't open it.
One of Eddie's experiments.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.864
This is ridiculous.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.499
I'm not gonna put our future
in the hands of your psychic.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.101
She has a gift, Louis.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.270
Her guidance about my book deal
was dead on,

08:23.370 --> 08:24.905
she was right about Honey
having a boy...

08:25.005 --> 08:26.306
That's a 50/50 guess.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.475
...and she said that your
restaurant would be successful

08:28.576 --> 08:29.710
when we first moved here.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.012
Well, how do I know, like her,
you're not making that up?

08:32.112 --> 08:34.715
She also predicted that
you would be hesitant.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.216
That's why I bought her
an open-ended ticket.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.152
Yeah, she's not leaving until
you let her give you a reading.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.355
My first time
to Florida.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.392
Gonna do SeaWorld, Disney,
swamp boat ride,

08:45.492 --> 08:47.561
maybe take a class
at the community college.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.129
Hmm.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.230
The longer you resist,

08:50.330 --> 08:52.365
the more fun she'll see
in her future.

08:54.802 --> 08:55.936
What are you doing?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.138
We're throwing out our underwear
so we won't be tempted.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.472
Tempted

08:59.573 --> 09:01.942
After you left, we turned on
Regis and Kathie Lee.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.376
Usually,
we'd never watch that crap.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.512
But they did
a really powerful segment

09:05.613 --> 09:06.714
on the true meaning of Lent,

09:06.814 --> 09:08.215
and it convinced us
to give it a try.

09:08.315 --> 09:11.752
Regis and Kathie Lee are
giving up underwear for 40 days.

09:11.852 --> 09:12.886
So we're gonna try, too.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.155
Why on Earth would Regis
give up underwear?!

09:15.255 --> 09:16.256
Kathie Lee maybe.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.158
So they could be
more like Jesus.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.426
Because he didn't
wear underwear.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.394
Excuse me!
Jesus wore underwear.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.163
Not according to them,
he didn't.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.732
They said it was too hot
in the desert.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.934
Plus, even if
he did own a pair,

09:27.034 --> 09:29.069
you know he'd lend them
to the less fortunate.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.971
You guys are just
messing with me.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.040
Oh, yeah? How many times
does it mention underwear

09:33.140 --> 09:34.574
in the Bible
you're always reading?

09:35.809 --> 09:38.345
And you call yourself
a student of religion.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.081
If you don't believe us,
watch the tape.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.917
Aha! You're trying to
make me break Lent.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.319
I should've known.
You never even watched the show.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.622
Yes, we did.
Oh, yeah,
then who was the guest?

09:48.722 --> 09:49.890
Reba McEntire.
Reba McEntire.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.291
Ugh, that sounds right.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.260
Come on, let's go find
a super-cool homeless kid

09:53.360 --> 09:55.062
who needs underwear.

09:59.066 --> 10:03.136
I'm trying to look back,
but there's a spirit in the way.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.638
You lost a family member?

10:04.738 --> 10:07.140
Yes, I've lost a relative.
Everyone has.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.276
I haven't.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.478
Louis, I told you
she has a gift.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.046
Stop fighting it.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.415
Something else
is coming into focus.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.484
I see a past life.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.587
-Hmm.
-One where you are a turtle.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.255
-Yes, that sounds right.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.392
He makes decisions
like a turtle -- Slow.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.927
Okay, I don't see
how anything you're seeing

10:27.027 --> 10:28.061
is supposed to help me.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.563
Madame Xing
can't help what she sees.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.965
She's on a higher level.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.769
Yes. Now give me
those nice hands.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.809
Ow!

10:41.909 --> 10:43.110
I think I broke my tooth!

10:43.210 --> 10:47.014
In dreams, a broken tooth
symbolizes a hidden frustration.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.149
Not hidden, lady!

10:49.249 --> 10:51.752
I'm going to Marvin,
see if he can fix this.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.987
Decisive action.
That's progress.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.692
Oh, yeah,
you cracked your enamel.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.493
You've been
grinding your teeth.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.628
I'm a little stressed.

11:01.729 --> 11:02.863
Ah. Same.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.765
I'm meeting Honey
for lunch.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.166
We've been
having a major battle

11:06.266 --> 11:08.201
about whether to
circumcise the baby.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.803
She doesn't want to?

11:09.903 --> 11:12.005
No, she says there's a lot of
sensation in that part.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.041
Nerve endings.
How does she know?

11:14.141 --> 11:18.211
Anyway, just lie back
and enjoy the gas, Lou.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.613
I fought in the Navy.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.550
I can't let it come out
that I didn't circumcise my boy.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.853
I go to reunions.
It's gonna come up.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.321
You know, there was a guy
in our unit that, uh,

11:28.421 --> 11:30.824
well, he was,
you know, natural.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.494
MADAME XING:
I see a past life.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.965
One where you are a turtle.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.901
LOUIS: Pro -- we get to
the other side of the road.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.170
Con -- we die.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.472
Maybe we should go for it.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.841
It's been two hours,
and not one car.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.243
Although,
it just increases the odds

11:50.343 --> 11:51.779
that one is about to come.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.146
It's too dangerous.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.481
Although...

11:54.581 --> 11:56.683
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:56.784 --> 11:57.717
Where are you going?

11:57.818 --> 11:59.219
What --
What are you doing?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.353
Carl, don't just --

12:02.856 --> 12:05.692
Aaaaaaaah!

12:05.793 --> 12:07.727
And what's it gonna be like
when my son and I

12:07.828 --> 12:10.063
go to the sauna
for the first time?

12:12.265 --> 12:16.636
* Fat guy in a little coat *

12:16.736 --> 12:18.271
What is this movie?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.307
I can't follow any of this.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.742
There might be some-- Ugh.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.177
There might be something

12:24.277 --> 12:25.478
to this reincarnation stuff
after all!

12:25.578 --> 12:27.180
Madame Xing said
you'd come around.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.281
As always,
it takes you a while,

12:28.381 --> 12:29.749
but eventually you see
that I am right.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.019
No, actually, you were wrong.
I had a vision.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.586
I was a turtle,
and this other tur--

12:33.686 --> 12:35.823
-Yeah, I was a turtle --

12:35.923 --> 12:37.124
I've never had a vision!

12:37.224 --> 12:39.960
You don't even believe.
I'm almost morning mist!

12:40.060 --> 12:42.095
I should be having a vision.
Not you.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.530
How did you have a vision?

12:45.799 --> 12:47.367
EMERY: How's it going?

12:47.467 --> 12:48.936
You finding any underwear
mentions in the Bible?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.938
Got another
tape of Regis.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.140
Day 2 of them
not wearing underwear for Lent.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.741
Regis still found a way
to work in

12:54.842 --> 12:56.476
that he graduated
from Notre Dame.

12:56.576 --> 13:02.549
**

13:02.649 --> 13:03.951
Why is it so important

13:04.051 --> 13:05.819
for a son to look like
his father down there?

13:05.919 --> 13:08.255
When will anyone see you
side by side?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.489
In the sauna.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.224
Just snip the kid already.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.660
If he's anything like his
mother, he'll be a lazy cleaner.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.829
Now gas me.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.966
I want a vision
like the one Louis had.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.667
So, ergh, ergh, ergh.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.937
Uh, I just can't give gas to
people for the fun of it.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.339
I swore an ethical
code of responsibility.

13:26.439 --> 13:30.310
Well, then, have Honey crank
the dial and you turn around.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.379
Babe, you game?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.347
Sure, works for me.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.754
I don't feel anything.
Turn it higher.

13:41.855 --> 13:42.890
It's all the way up.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.091
What is going on?

13:44.191 --> 13:45.258
I don't get it.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.494
That amount of nitrous
could knock out a rhino.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.931
Are you giving me
the cheap stuff?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.333
I thought we were friends.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.136
Sub-par gas...

13:57.837 --> 14:00.440
-I could eat.

14:01.708 --> 14:06.379
Delayed reaction.
Sub-par gas, indeed.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.751
JESSICA:
It worked. A vision.

14:11.851 --> 14:16.056
I've achieved the ultimate
level of being -- morning mist.

14:16.156 --> 14:20.160
Ooh, does baby like
the new humidifier?

14:20.260 --> 14:21.929
Marvin?
Get out of my mist!

14:22.029 --> 14:24.631
Why are you
talking like that?

14:24.731 --> 14:28.635
Who's my little
pookie

14:28.735 --> 14:29.903
No!
Oh.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.871
I've come back as...

14:31.972 --> 14:36.076
Honey and Marvin's
white baby?!

14:38.045 --> 14:40.280
Help. I am Jessica Huang.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.083
I am supposed to be
reincarnated as morning mist,

14:43.183 --> 14:45.685
not in this
white-baby cage!

14:46.686 --> 14:48.388
Oh! A party.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.923
Okay, listen up.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.092
Before anyone
gets too attached to me,

14:52.192 --> 14:54.094
I am not supposed to be here.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.363
I was reborn
in the wrong body.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.066
Okay, time for
your circumcision.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.368
What

15:01.468 --> 15:03.370
No way.
I am out of here.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.076
Ahh, I can't do anything!

15:09.176 --> 15:11.178
But I'm a woman of action!

15:12.745 --> 15:13.813
Let's talk about this.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.217
Don't just act,
weigh the pros and cons.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.854
No!

15:23.390 --> 15:24.424
So I was right!

15:24.524 --> 15:26.126
Your vision showed you
that debating things

15:26.226 --> 15:27.394
is better than
acting first.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.262
No, it showed me
the exact opposite.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.364
How can you say that?
You got circumcised!

15:31.464 --> 15:33.400
You wanted people to
not rush in and mull.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.402
You didn't
let me finish.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.439
You know what?
That wasn't that bad.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.975
I feel faster. Streamlined.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.278
Madame Xing, thank God!

15:45.378 --> 15:47.047
Release me
from this vision!

15:47.147 --> 15:48.681
What a little cutie!

15:50.717 --> 15:53.286
Why are you
holding my husband's nice hand?

15:53.386 --> 15:55.755
I still can't believe how
quickly you guys got married.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.657
What?

15:57.757 --> 15:59.926
I just threw up.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.529
You let a piece of prime meat
hit the market,

16:02.629 --> 16:05.165
it's gonna get snatched.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.367
Xing, you viper!

16:07.467 --> 16:09.902
As soon as I can walk,
I'm coming for you.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.440
Boys, use napkins.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.475
ALL: Yes, Mommy Xing.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.844
Well, I don't hate
the discipline.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.449
I can't believe
your mom isn't here.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.018
She's the one who convinced me
to snip little Dan.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.320
Dan?!
I know.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.457
I wish she and Madame Xing
had never gone to the beach.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.891
Such a freak accident.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.861
They were debating whether to
play volleyball or go kayaking

16:34.961 --> 16:38.431
when that rogue wave surprised
Mom and swept her out to sea.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.867
I married Madame Xing?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.302
I was right.

16:42.402 --> 16:45.172
If I had acted quickly
instead of debating,

16:45.272 --> 16:48.375
I would have lived instead of
being eaten by the ocean.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.676
Okay, this is ridiculous.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.411
We're debating
nitrous-gas dreams.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.712
What about reality?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.314
Okay,
let's talk reality.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.548
You and I made a decision

16:55.648 --> 16:57.784
to buy back Kenny Rogers' half
of the restaurant

16:57.884 --> 16:59.519
and now you get
all wishy

16:59.619 --> 17:00.987
Well, maybe without
Kenny Rogers

17:01.088 --> 17:02.822
and Michael Bolton's names
on the sign,

17:02.922 --> 17:03.990
people would
stop coming in.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.558
Or maybe they wouldn't.
I don't know.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.427
I just wanted more time
to think it through.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.596
Why do you have to
talk everything to death?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.331
At least I don't act
without thinking.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.032
You bought a lobster tank
on a whim!

17:13.133 --> 17:15.202
That thing is beautiful!
It's empty!

17:15.302 --> 17:17.737
I don't know where Matthew
or the lobsters went!

17:20.207 --> 17:22.875
How can we both be right?
We're saying opposite things.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.247
That's why
I couldn't follow it.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.458
That makes
a lot of sense.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.093
We do
work well together.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.129
You can't argue
with success.

18:17.797 --> 18:18.965
Insightful.

18:19.065 --> 18:19.999
Maybe in your next life,

18:20.099 --> 18:22.001
you will come back
as morning mist.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.776
So what do you want to do
about the restaurant?

18:29.876 --> 18:32.078
Well, I looked at my list,

18:32.179 --> 18:34.981
and after carefully weighing
the pros and cons,

18:35.081 --> 18:36.483
I think we should buy back

18:36.583 --> 18:37.950
Kenny Rogers' half
of the restaurant.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.452
Are you sure
that's what you want?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.453
I'm sure.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.555
I'm glad.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.425
Because I already signed
the papers with Lorenzo.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.627
What?
I acted before thinking,

18:47.727 --> 18:49.128
but that's what
you love about me!

18:49.229 --> 18:50.297
When did you do this?

18:50.397 --> 18:51.631
Early on.
Very early.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.400
I stopped Lorenzo
in the parking lot

18:53.500 --> 18:55.168
as he was leaving
Cattleman's.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.404
Signed the papers
on the hood of his car.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.271
I Yang-ed it.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.039
Then why fly in
Madame Xing?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.574
Because you
were so against it,

19:01.674 --> 19:03.075
I thought she could
convince you.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.178
I didn't know that
Morning Mist over here

19:05.278 --> 19:06.579
was sitting on
the Yin-Yang key.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.014
Why did you tell me now?

19:08.114 --> 19:10.183
Because now
you agree with me.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.989
Dear Jesus, is it true they said
on Regis and Kathie Lee

19:17.089 --> 19:18.325
that you didn't wear underwear?

19:18.425 --> 19:21.428
If I watch, I break Lent,
but I need to know.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.796
Please, just give me a sign.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.932
I feel bad.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.600
My heart.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.703
There was no segment
about Jesus' underwear.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.572
We made it all up.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.174
You work in mysterious ways,
you all-knowing shepherd.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.309
We're sorry.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.044
It's just that you get
so unbearable during Lent.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.046
That's why we tried to
get you to break.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.014
But you got
to forgive us, right?

19:42.114 --> 19:43.216
Your religion says so.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.017
God forgives
unconditionally.

19:45.852 --> 19:46.886
But I don't.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.556
I tell Mommy
unless you make it up to me.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.991
Good morning!
I am Regis Philbin.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.227
And I'm
Kathie Lee Gifford.

19:54.327 --> 19:57.063
I don't want to be Kathie Lee.
Can't we both be Regis?

19:57.163 --> 19:58.064
Don't be ridiculous.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.666
America can't handle
two Regises.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.401
Now, do it
like I wrote it.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.004
We got a great show for you
this morning.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.439
Reba McEntire's here.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.907
Caught her sound check.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.877
You're in for a treat, America,
so don't go anywhere.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.280
Oh, what are we watching?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.014
Eddie and Emery are acting out
a fake episode

20:15.114 --> 20:16.215
of Regis and Kathie Lee
I wrote.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.417
Great.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.451
Where's Dad?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.219
Oh, he's Yin-ing out.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.422
He's making
a pro and con list

20:22.522 --> 20:23.990
about whether he's going to
speak to me again.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.125
It'll take him a while, but
he'll come around eventually.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.427
EDDIE:
Did you see this?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.262
Some disturbing news
out of Buffalo.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.564
A truck jack-knifed
off the interstate,

20:31.664 --> 20:34.267
killing 50 cattle
and a hitchhiker.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.402
I hitchhiked once.

20:35.502 --> 20:36.869
Kathie Lee!

20:36.969 --> 20:38.271
This is good.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.539
I know.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.641
EMERY :
Reg, it was the '60s!

20:45.812 --> 20:47.814
Your face
is red as a lobster.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.083
I should throw you in the tank
at the restaurant.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.184
God knows there's room.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.154
I was at Disney all day!
I met Goofy.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
Did you try
and kill Mrs. Goofy

20:57.357 --> 20:59.292
so you could have him
all for yourself?

20:59.392 --> 21:01.294
What are you
talking about?

21:01.394 --> 21:02.261
I had a vision.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.463
You let me die,

21:03.563 --> 21:06.132
and then
you stole my husband.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.133
You're fired, Xing.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.469
But I'm your psychic.
You need me!

21:09.569 --> 21:10.970
I'll find a new psychic.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.271
One who's local

21:12.372 --> 21:14.574
and on anti-depressants
to squelch her sex drive.

21:14.674 --> 21:18.645
I see you rethinking this
after a good night's sleep.

21:18.745 --> 21:23.650
Mm, I see you walking
back to D.C.

21:29.356 --> 21:32.492
