02:08.960 --> 02:12.669
l now call this meeting
of NO MA'AM to order.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.235
ln honour of brother Griff's
one-year anniversary...

02:15.440 --> 02:17.396
...as a member of NO MA'AM...

02:17.600 --> 02:20.717
...we must now think of a practical joke
to play on him.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.599
l don't remember anybody
pulling a practical joke on me.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.635
Remember on the expressway
when your brakes failed...

02:26.840 --> 02:28.512
...and you almost died?

02:29.720 --> 02:31.438
That was us.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.396
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.397
Brother Dan, it was your job...

02:40.600 --> 02:42.955
...to keep brother Griff
away from tonight's meeting.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.078
l don't remember anybody keeping me
away from any meeting.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.795
Remember when Dan accidentally
shot you in the back...

02:51.560 --> 02:54.074
...and you were hospitalized
for seven weeks?

02:54.320 --> 02:55.719
That was us.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.796
Good one, guys.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.553
So what did you do to Griff?

03:03.760 --> 03:06.558
-Oh, l just had him arrested.
-What's the charge?

03:07.280 --> 03:10.158
lndecent exposure, murder,
cannibalism.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.078
Great work, brother Dan.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.676
And that'll give us a lot of time
to think of a great joke to play on him.

03:18.920 --> 03:23.391
Now, l think it's only fitting
that the joke come from me...

03:23.600 --> 03:25.795
...since l am
the king of practical jokes.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.632
No, l'm the king.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.719
Wearing a quilted robe
and sitting on a throne all day...

03:31.920 --> 03:33.876
...doesn't make you a king.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.559
l say we have 1 0 pizzas sent
to brother Griff's apartment.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.075
How does he do it?

03:42.000 --> 03:46.551
l say that we hire a cross-dresser
to pick up Griff...

03:46.760 --> 03:50.639
...and seduce him
while we get it on tape.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.434
That doesn't compare to pizzas.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.955
All those who are in favour
of my practical joke?

03:58.520 --> 04:01.717
-All those in favour of mine?
-Yeah!

04:02.720 --> 04:06.030
Well, Al, l guess it's obvious
where we go from here.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.955
Yes, it is. You know what? Get the hell
out of my house! Meeting is adjourned.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.353
-Sore loser.
-Anyway....

04:12.600 --> 04:15.751
Oh, well. l guess l better
go spring Griff from jail.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.190
Well, it's doughnut night
at the nudie bar.

04:18.399 --> 04:22.029
Every hooter is either glazed
or jelly-filled.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.916
Griff can wait.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.830
l was robbed.
My pizza joke was better.

04:30.080 --> 04:34.119
Yeah, yeah. You're right, Al.
You the man. Let's shake on it.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.115
l gotcha!

04:40.560 --> 04:43.632
You got me, buddy. You're right.
You're the king of practical jokes.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.831
-Nuts?
-Oh, thanks.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.437
Gotcha!

04:49.640 --> 04:51.756
Okay. Okay, Al.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.757
l challenge you to a duel.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.514
May the best joker win.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.951
Let's rock.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.078
This news bulletin just in.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.159
The Chicago Cannibal has been
arraigned for over 1 00 murders.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.271
The cannibal, shown in this picture...

05:15.720 --> 05:18.518
...says he's innocent,
claiming there is no evidence.

05:18.720 --> 05:23.714
The D A responded by saying,
''evidence, schmevidence. ''

05:24.360 --> 05:28.273
Hey, Bud. Guess who's been arrested
for eating people?

05:28.720 --> 05:30.836
Who, Tommy Lasorda?

05:32.560 --> 05:35.597
Listen, Kelly, can you please explain
to me the outgoing message...

05:35.800 --> 05:37.995
...on our new answering machine?

05:38.200 --> 05:41.636
Hi, you've reached Kelly.
Please leave a message at the tone.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.628
If you're a girl calling for Bud,
hi, Mom!

05:47.840 --> 05:50.400
That's not very funny
to me anymore--

05:54.880 --> 05:57.030
You should see what l just did.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.994
l just had 1 0 pizzas sent
to Jefferson's house.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.510
l am the king of practical jokes.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.870
Oh, my God. lt's Webster!

06:26.080 --> 06:27.911
-Webster! Webster!
-Oh, my God!

06:29.760 --> 06:31.955
l don't think so.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.596
Al Bundy, l was sent here
from Publishers Sweepstakes...

06:35.800 --> 06:38.951
...and you've just won $1 0 million!

06:39.600 --> 06:43.878
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

06:46.360 --> 06:48.920
And your mother's not here
to share our joy.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.192
-Could life be any better?
-No!

06:53.840 --> 06:55.068
Oh, what's going on?

06:55.280 --> 06:58.716
Urkel here just gave me
1 0 million bucks.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.359
Congratulations. What are you
gonna do with all the money?

07:03.600 --> 07:06.353
l'm gonna quit my job,
burn down this house...

07:06.560 --> 07:09.120
...and live out my days
on Hooter lsland.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.430
Well, on an occasion like this,
there's only one thing to say:

07:14.680 --> 07:16.910
Gotcha!

07:25.960 --> 07:29.191
All right, cannibal,
we know you ate those people.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.549
Now confess!

07:30.800 --> 07:33.473
l haven't eaten anyone!

07:37.200 --> 07:39.760
l don't even like ribs.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.318
Call my ex-wife.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.551
We did.
She said she once caught you...

07:46.760 --> 07:49.877
...pouring chocolate syrup
on her best friend.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.990
That wasn't cannibalism,
that was adultery.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.314
Look. Let me call my friend Al.
He'll prove l'm innocent.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.190
And will you please stop erasing
the messages before l hear them...

08:09.400 --> 08:12.312
...you human futon.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.394
Bud, you didn't get any messages.
Believe me.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.239
With my eagle ears,
l listen very carefully...

08:20.440 --> 08:24.228
...to each and every message
before l erase them.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.239
Al, it's Griff. You gotta help me.
I'm in--

08:33.000 --> 08:35.594
Besides, Bud,
your girlfriends can't call you here.

08:35.799 --> 08:40.510
You have to call them,
and it costs $3.95 a minute.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.475
Kids, kids.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.357
l just pulled the ultimate practical joke
on Jefferson.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.512
What? You sent him 20 pizzas?

08:57.360 --> 09:00.033
No, that'd be stupid. He's full.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.750
No, l put superglue
on his toilet seat.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.477
Oh, what kind of moron
would fall for that old gag?

09:16.040 --> 09:18.395
Mark my words, Al,
as soon as l can sit down...

09:18.600 --> 09:22.513
...and think of something,
you will pay!

09:26.560 --> 09:30.758
Damn it, Kelly, today l know
l had a message because....

09:31.400 --> 09:34.073
Because l called myself.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.553
Well, then you already have
a date for tonight.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.796
Home, sweet hell.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.669
Kids are fighting, dog's a-biting...

09:56.600 --> 09:59.672
...and a good-looking babe
in the kitchen cooking me dinner.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.557
A woman cooking me dinner? Kids?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.956
Oh, she said
she's an old friend of Mom's.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.720
What the hell did you let her in for?

10:14.480 --> 10:16.232
Al, l'm June Morgan.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.877
l ran into Peggy in Barcelona, and she
told me you were all alone in Chicago.

10:21.080 --> 10:26.518
So l thought l would come by
and fix you a gourmet dinner.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.399
Oh, Weenie Tots.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.878
You know, Al, looking around...

10:33.080 --> 10:35.833
...l can see several things
that could use a woman's touch.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.349
lf you know what l mean?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.714
With vittles as classy as these,
you can stick around...

10:43.920 --> 10:46.070
...and touch anything you want.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.910
Okay, l will.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.753
Daddy!

10:54.960 --> 10:57.030
You can't let that woman
spend the night here.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.800
-What about Mom?
-What about her?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.868
Body's not even cold yet.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.032
You've obviously never slept
with your mother.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.709
Oh, come on, kids. Don't you get it?
June's not a friend of your mom's.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.832
She's all part
of Jefferson's practical joke.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.271
You know, like Rerun
and that phony check.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.393
So you'll call Mr. D'Arcy
and tell him you're on to his joke?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.989
No. l'm gonna beat him
at his own game.

11:25.480 --> 11:29.917
Oh, you're gonna pretend to like
Mrs. D'Arcy and take all her money?

11:31.160 --> 11:35.950
No, l'm gonna let June seduce me.
But first, we're gonna eat like royalty.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.118
-Yeah.
-Weenie Tots. Come on, come on!

11:54.440 --> 11:57.000
l didn't eat nobody.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.958
In national news, with the capture
of the notorious Chicago Cannibal--

12:11.440 --> 12:17.151
-Daddy, guess who's in prison?
-Unless it's Pauly Shore, l do not care.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.874
Bud, get up here.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.869
All right, now, this is the plan.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.197
When June comes down here,
she's going to try to seduce me.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.829
You two will be outside videotaping.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.390
What about--?
What about the walls, Dad?

12:34.600 --> 12:38.115
Because we can't shoot
through the walls.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.032
Bud, you will be videotaping.

12:45.240 --> 12:50.314
Now, Jefferson thinks
that l will only go so far with June.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.397
At which point,
he will declare victory...

12:52.600 --> 12:56.070
...and tell everyone that l'm not man
enough to cheat on my wife. lnstead...

12:56.280 --> 12:59.477
...l will go on the attack,
making June back up.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.830
At which point,
l will declare victory...

13:02.040 --> 13:06.113
...and proudly tell everyone that l am
man enough to cheat on my wife.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.674
Now, let's go get set up.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.199
Come on.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.517
At least when l get married,
l get to change my name.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.196
Yeah, this time you should try
to change it to one you can spell.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.595
Al, it's me, Peggy.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.711
Honey, I just ran into June Morgan...

13:31.920 --> 13:34.309
...an old rival of mine
from Wank er County.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.437
She's held a grudge
against me for years...

13:36.640 --> 13:39.950
...just because I stole her fiance
on her wedding day.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.709
I've seen 1 5 Murder, She Wrotes
that started lik e this.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.589
And get this.

13:46.800 --> 13:51.669
She swears she's gonna get even
by stealing you away from me.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.151
Alsy?

14:03.640 --> 14:06.598
Can you believe it?
l forgot to pack a dress.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.200
Well, we all make mistakes.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.997
l forgot to ice down this six-pack
of champagne tallboys.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.596
For you, my sweet.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.319
What's going on?

14:31.560 --> 14:34.518
Well, Dad just poured
a can of champagne into his hand.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.030
Oh, l've made men do that.

14:39.240 --> 14:45.315
-Your arms, they're so strong.
-Well, l sell women's shoes.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.195
Yeah, l can tell.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.552
All right. l think we've had about
enough foreplay.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.758
What's happening now?

14:57.960 --> 15:01.555
She's got Dad's entire face
in her mouth.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.312
Take me, Al.
Take me in the worst way!

15:16.560 --> 15:19.597
That's the only way l know how.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.075
-June.
-What?

15:26.280 --> 15:28.191
June, we-- We can't do this.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.992
Why not?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.356
Yeah, why not?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.471
I can't let Jefferson win.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.558
But he's hired someone so good,
I have to think of something...

15:37.760 --> 15:42.709
...so horrible, so vile, so disgusting
she'll run screaming from the house.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.717
I know.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.039
June, June.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.071
Marry me.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.629
You can't do it, can you?

16:00.080 --> 16:02.719
No. You're already married to Peggy.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.628
Was married.

16:04.840 --> 16:09.277
Yeah, she got
a quickie Spanish divorce.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.830
That's why she's in Spain.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.638
So what is your answer?

16:16.200 --> 16:19.715
Yes! Yes, l'll marry you!

16:21.920 --> 16:24.832
Today's trial of the Chicago Cannibal
made history.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.958
In only eight minutes...

16:30.160 --> 16:34.312
...he was tried, convicted,
and sentenced to die tonight.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.228
Well, this is great.

16:42.440 --> 16:45.159
Everybody's here but my best man.
Where's Griff?

16:45.400 --> 16:47.038
Griff? Griff?

16:47.240 --> 16:49.276
Wasn't there something
l was supposed to do?

16:50.240 --> 16:53.755
Hell with it.
lt's not a matter of life and death.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.994
Hey, preacher man, you made it.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.670
Are we lucky or what?

17:06.880 --> 17:11.351
lsaac from The Love Boat
is also an ordained minister.

17:12.400 --> 17:17.917
And look, Free Willy
is also the dork of honour.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.636
Let's get this freak show
on the road.

17:24.319 --> 17:27.153
-Hey, Jefferson.
-Hey, Al.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.595
How come you're not dressed
for a wedding?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.114
What wedding?

17:31.320 --> 17:34.312
Didn't your friend June
tell you all about it?

17:34.520 --> 17:37.080
lf that's her real name.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.318
l don't know any June.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.236
Of course you don't.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.998
Hey, lke. lke, who's getting married?

17:50.920 --> 17:54.708
Oh, you are good. You are real good.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.277
We are gathered here today...

18:30.480 --> 18:33.552
...to join this couple...

18:33.760 --> 18:35.273
...in holy matrimony.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.710
Yadda yadda yadda, June,
blah blah blah, Al...

18:37.920 --> 18:40.195
...blah blah blah, sight of God.

18:40.840 --> 18:44.753
Oh, this is so beautiful.

18:45.760 --> 18:49.150
l want my first wedding
to be just like it.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.909
June, do you take Al to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.273
Here it comes.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.119
She'll never say ''I do. ''

19:00.320 --> 19:02.117
l do.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.077
She do.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.395
Al, do you take June to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

19:17.360 --> 19:19.590
What do you want me to say,
Jefferson?

19:19.840 --> 19:23.833
You want me to say you're king?
l won't say it. l'm not gonna say it.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.473
Admit that this is your little joke!

19:28.520 --> 19:30.317
lt's not.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.318
This is my joke.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.159
Hi, Al.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.279
-Mom!
-Mom!

19:54.760 --> 19:56.432
l do.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.475
-Who is this woman?
-She's nobody.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.434
Just my wife.
Hurry up with the ring, boy!

20:06.360 --> 20:10.399
-What is going on here?
-Well, Peg, it all started with 1 0 pizzas.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.073
Shut up, Al.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.551
June Morgan, how dare you?

20:15.800 --> 20:18.314
Well, you stole my fiance
at the Wanker wedding hole.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.199
Get over it. We were 1 2.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.949
All right, here's the last
of the duty-free doodie.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.029
Al, l'm gonna go hitch a winch...

20:37.240 --> 20:42.030
...up to Mama's girdle
and twang her on out of here.

20:43.360 --> 20:47.194
What the hell's going on here?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.677
lt's Jefferson's fault.
He told me l won $1 0 million.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.589
Yeah, well, you superglued
a toilet seat to my ass.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.750
What's a toilet seat?

20:58.600 --> 21:01.433
Didn't you get the message
l left you on the answering machine?

21:01.640 --> 21:04.074
What's an answering machine?

21:04.320 --> 21:07.471
No, no. Nobody seems to get the
messages off that answering machine.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.752
-Oh, so this is all my fault, then?
-Oh, no, honey.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.195
Once again,
this is your father's fault.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.637
You know what you're gonna have to do
to make this up to me, don't you?

21:16.880 --> 21:19.394
Oh, no, Peg!

21:20.320 --> 21:22.709
Not upstairs!

21:23.280 --> 21:27.159
Oh, no, honey.
We're gonna do it standing up.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.108
Right here in front of everyone.

21:40.480 --> 21:46.350
For the 37th time, Bundy, do you take
this woman to be your wife?

21:48.040 --> 21:52.397
For the thirty-seventh,
-eighth and -ninth times:

21:52.640 --> 21:55.837
No, no, no.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.073
Come on, Al. lt's not like
we're really getting married.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.671
We're just renewing our vows.
Besides, Dad's got you covered.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.232
Just like old times, eh, Ephraim?

22:14.600 --> 22:18.195
Only this time, the gun is loaded.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.155
And so am l.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.108
-Well, Bundy?
-l'm not saying it.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.392
The drunken hillbilly's gonna
have to kill me before l say it again.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.911
-Say what?
-'' l do.''

22:35.160 --> 22:37.913
-Gotcha!
-No, Peg, that doesn't count!

22:38.120 --> 22:40.350
Oh, Al.
