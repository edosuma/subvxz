WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:07.373
(pans clanging)

00:07.375 --> 00:08.574
MAN:
Wakey, wakey!

00:08.576 --> 00:10.075
Rise and shine.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.443
MAN 1: Who wants
to fight, huh?

00:11.445 --> 00:12.778
Come on, get up.
Pathetic.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.079
You're all pathetic!

00:14.081 --> 00:15.647
Who wants to fight?
How about you?

00:15.649 --> 00:17.383
Come on! Hey, you!

00:17.385 --> 00:19.084
MAN:
Hey, leave us alone!

00:19.086 --> 00:20.652
Get up here, come on!

00:20.654 --> 00:22.221
Pathetic!

00:22.223 --> 00:24.006
Pathetic, pathetic!

00:24.007 --> 00:25.790
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey,
where's the fire, old-timer?

00:25.793 --> 00:28.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man, stick around.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.661
Have ourselves a good
old-fashioned bum fight.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.730
I'm talking to you!

00:31.732 --> 00:32.798
Come on!

00:32.800 --> 00:34.099
Fight me!

00:35.503 --> 00:36.802
Huh? I said, fi...

00:38.672 --> 00:41.140
(man sobbing)

00:43.144 --> 00:44.176
(screaming)

00:44.178 --> 00:46.478
(grunting)

00:56.223 --> 00:58.323
(grunting)

01:00.628 --> 01:03.262
(breathlessly):
Okay, okay.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.397
(groaning)

01:08.836 --> 01:11.703
(Taser crackling,
man grunting)

01:39.166 --> 01:42.835
SAM:
Yeah. Oh, that's good, baby.

01:42.837 --> 01:45.338
That's really good.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.840
Now, you remember the difference
between obtuse and acute angles?

01:47.842 --> 01:49.708
GIRL: Uh, not really.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.610
Okay, think about it, we
went over this last night.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.813
Now, when something's small
it's cute.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.349
So, an angle that's smaller
than 90 degrees...

01:57.351 --> 01:59.284
GIRL: It's acute.
SAM: There you go.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.353
You're gonna ace this math quiz.
GIRL: Yay!

02:01.355 --> 02:03.655
All right, Daddy's got to go,
I lo...
GIRL: Love you, Daddy.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.656
Huh?

02:04.658 --> 02:06.158
I love you.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.526
SAM: I love you, too.
GIRL: Bye, Daddy.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.394
All right, beautiful. Bye-bye.
GIRL: Bye.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.797
Wow, that's, uh...

02:11.799 --> 02:14.333
father-of-the-year
material right there.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.901
CALLEN: You know,
if you're not careful,

02:15.903 --> 02:17.903
she's gonna end up a mathlete
just like her old man.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.405
Junior Math Olympian.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.906
How many times do
I have to tell you that?

02:20.908 --> 02:21.874
Till it stops
being funny.

02:21.876 --> 02:22.875
Which is never.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.810
SAM: Okay, laugh
all you want,

02:24.812 --> 02:27.412
but that's not what makes me
father of the year, this is.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.285
You've put a GPS tracker
on your daughter.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.554
We gave her a cell phone.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.722
Huh.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.190
Isn't she kind of young?

02:38.192 --> 02:40.292
The world's kind
of dangerous.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.393
A cell phone lets me know
where she is at all times,

02:42.396 --> 02:44.696
and she can contact me
in case of emergency.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.431
You know, it's about peace
of mind, simple as that.

02:46.433 --> 02:50.736
All right, you know, as long as
you're not smothering her.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.904
(cell phone buzzes)

02:51.906 --> 02:53.472
I don't smother.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.375
Hey, baby, you okay?
Something wrong?

02:56.377 --> 02:58.210
Hey, Daddy, can we have
spaghetti for dinner tonight?

02:58.212 --> 03:00.746
You want spaghetti
for dinner tonight.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.781
I want spaghetti
for dinner tonight.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.650
GIRL: Yeah, with meatballs.
SAM: With meatballs.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.285
I'm coming over,
I'm bringing Monty.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.253
GIRL: Can you do it?
Sam: Okay, Daddy can do that.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.656
SAM: Daddy will get you some
spaghetti and meatballs.
GIRL: Are you sure?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.357
Daddy can do anything,
Daddy's a superhero.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.825
Thank you, Daddy, I love you!

03:13.827 --> 03:15.661
SAM:
Okay, all right.

03:15.663 --> 03:16.662
I love you, too.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.663
Okay, bye-bye.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.298
Bye!

03:19.300 --> 03:22.467
Well, peace of mind--
spaghetti crisis averted.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.635
You know, she's just
starting, uh...

03:23.637 --> 03:24.937
She just got it,
she's new to it.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.239
In a couple of days,
you know, she'll...

03:27.241 --> 03:28.540
(cell phone buzzes)
Hmm.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.475
Sure she's not smothering
you, Super Daddy?

03:32.446 --> 03:33.445
Baby, I have...

03:33.447 --> 03:34.846
Daddy, listen--
Knock, knock.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.215
Okay, who's there?

03:36.217 --> 03:37.282
Doughnut.

03:37.284 --> 03:38.383
Doughnut who?

03:38.385 --> 03:39.818
Doughnut ask, it's a secret.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.320
Great, look...

03:41.322 --> 03:42.821
You like it?

03:42.823 --> 03:44.690
You have to go to class, and
Daddy has to go back to work.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.792
GIRL: I love you.
SAM: I love you, too.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.694
All right, sweetheart.
All right, bye-bye.
GIRL: Bye, Daddy.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.062
Bye.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.429
Doughnut who?
What's the punch line?

03:51.432 --> 03:52.965
(whistling)

03:52.967 --> 03:53.966
Granger danger.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.235
All hands on deck.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.502
DEEKS: Come on,
what's the punch line?

03:57.504 --> 03:58.870
Sam-dog, what's
the punch line?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.505
Don't do this,
don't leave me hanging here.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.573
What's the punch line?

04:01.575 --> 04:04.009
Doughnut ask, it's a secret.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.345
Oh.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.579
(laughs)

04:07.581 --> 04:08.914
Oh, that is...

04:08.916 --> 04:10.649
that's actually pretty funny.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.351
That's a cute joke!

04:12.353 --> 04:14.786
ERIC: Early this morning,
LAPD was alerted to the body

04:14.788 --> 04:16.822
of a homeless John Doe
in a North Hollywood alley.

04:16.824 --> 04:20.592
No I.D., no police record,
and no fingerprints on file.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.395
Well, that rules out
a Marine or Navy vet.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.529
Not exactly, Agent Hanna.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.782
The man's fingerprints
are on file,

04:26.783 --> 04:29.034
(cell phone buzzes)
just not in any
law enforcement database.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.271
When LAPD scanned
John Doe's fingerprints,

04:32.273 --> 04:34.773
it triggered
a classified DoD alert.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.343
GRANGER:
His name's Harrison Goodsell.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.880
Marine, member of the CIA
Special Activities Division.

04:41.882 --> 04:45.317
Over the past two decades, he's
worked dozens of classified ops.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.718
Afghanistan, Russia.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.887
Even Iran and North Korea.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.389
The people who worked
with Goodsell

04:50.391 --> 04:52.341
called him The Grey Man.

04:52.342 --> 04:54.292
Wait, what's...
what's "The Grey Man"?

04:54.295 --> 04:55.761
It's a term used in special ops.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.863
A Grey Man is someone
who has the skills

04:57.865 --> 04:59.998
to blend into any environment
and remain unnoticed.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.434
Unknowable.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.869
Best way to avoid confrontation
in hostile territory.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.672
But not 100 percent effective.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.707
M.E. reports that Goodsell
was tortured

05:08.709 --> 05:10.509
before his killers
finished him off.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.044
Cut his throat.

05:12.046 --> 05:15.380
You're worried someone got to
the secrets in Goodsell's head.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.882
Years later, that kind
of intel could put

05:16.884 --> 05:19.084
American lives at risk.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.787
We should talk to some of his
friends in Special Activities.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.555
I'll handle the
CIA, Agent Callen.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.558
Your team should focus on
the murder investigation.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.393
Sam and I'll check out
the crime scene.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.395
Kensi, Deeks-- get his photo
around to all the shelters,

05:30.397 --> 05:32.731
see if anybody knew him.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.066
Report all
findings to me.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.535
KENSI:
Sir?

05:36.537 --> 05:39.071
Do we know why Goodsell ended
up living on the street?

05:39.073 --> 05:42.574
Well, CIA reports he had
a breakdown last year.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.743
Diagnosed PTSD,

05:44.745 --> 05:47.012
multiple traumatic
brain injuries.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.847
You know how the story goes.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.486
Yeah, yeah.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.688
Let's get moving.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.903
All right,
thanks, Eric.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.438
Keep looking.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.439
Down here.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.475
Thanks.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.577
Goodsell has
no family.

06:18.579 --> 06:22.614
Parents are deceased,
no kids, never married.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.449
Typical Grey Man.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.151
They don't punch out
at the end of the day.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.120
It's not conducive
to starting a family.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.855
You did.
(chuckles)

06:29.857 --> 06:31.490
I'm not a Grey Man.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.824
You, on the other hand...

06:32.826 --> 06:35.026
Have a girlfriend,
have a home.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.628
I'm doing just fine,
thank you.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.863
You're welcome.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.498
Five years ago--
different story.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.566
I put a lot of
work into you, G.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.468
Oh, so what, am I like Charlene,

06:43.470 --> 06:46.138
your, uh, car you used
to restore in your spare time?

06:46.140 --> 06:49.708
I'm saying it's about having
a support system, a safety net.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.510
Grey Man works without them.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.879
When he falls,
he hits the ground hard.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.581
Ends up here.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.955
May I?

07:03.957 --> 07:05.724
Sure.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.125
Lot of stuff here.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.461
Not sure if any
of it's gonna be helpful.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.230
SAM:
Yeah.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.998
No cameras on either end
of the alley.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.500
Or the adjoining streets.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.469
Perfect place for a body dump.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.141
They got a fingerprint

07:23.143 --> 07:26.144
and a downtown area code
for Civic Sushi.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.548
I'll send a copy
of the print to Eric,

07:29.550 --> 07:31.082
see if it matches our Grey Man.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.522
KENSI:<i> Civic Sushi has</i>
<i> four-and-a-half stars on Yelp,</i>

07:37.524 --> 07:39.157
all you can eat
till noon.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.893
You realize that you just
had breakfast in the car, right?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.495
That wasn't breakfast,
that was, uh...

07:43.497 --> 07:44.596
Second breakfast?
Elevenses?

07:44.598 --> 07:46.331
What, bath meal?

07:46.332 --> 07:48.065
Hey, when you've gone days
without eating like I have,

07:48.068 --> 07:49.534
you learn to
appreciate food.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.001
I'm just saying it's kind of
hard to appreciate something

07:51.004 --> 07:52.704
when you devour it.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.707
Literally, I blinked,
and the burrito was gone.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.108
Welcome to Civic Sushi.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.643
Please, have a seat anywhere.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.095
We're actually not eating.

08:00.096 --> 08:01.546
We're just here to ask
some questions to the manager.

08:01.548 --> 08:02.747
I'm the manager.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.182
Hideo.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.901
Great.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.619
In that case, do you
recognize this man?

08:07.621 --> 08:08.820
Yes, he is a customer.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.988
A regular.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.256
He ate here?

08:11.258 --> 08:12.624
That's very charitable of you.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.093
No charity,
he paid like everyone.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.828
Tipped well, too.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.497
I'm sorry,
the homeless man tipped you?

08:18.499 --> 08:19.564
Homeless?

08:19.566 --> 08:22.734
No, he wore a nice suit, tie.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.736
Talked on his phone,
he was a businessman.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.905
Why don't you look
at the picture one more time.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.174
Ah, come, I'll show you.

08:33.747 --> 08:37.115
He's in this photo I
took of DJ Salmon Run.

08:37.117 --> 08:40.652
KZPZ-- best
hip-hop in town.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.053
That's him.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.088
That's Goodsell.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.956
The hell was this guy up to?

08:58.705 --> 09:01.740
ERIC: Using the downtown sushi
place as a starting point,

09:01.742 --> 09:04.743
we scanned traffic cams
within a five block radius.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.845
And in the 72 hours
leading up to his death,

09:06.847 --> 09:08.713
we spotted Goodsell
four times.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.916
All within the vicinity
of Grand Park.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.568
ERIC:
Here he is yesterday,

09:12.569 --> 09:14.219
crossing the street toward
Civic Sushi for a late lunch.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.588
And here he is,
one day earlier,

09:16.590 --> 09:19.691
appearing in two different
areas of Grand Park.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.860
Hmm.
Back to being
homeless.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.162
And finally, only six hours
before that...

09:25.132 --> 09:26.865
One block away
from the park.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.301
Again,
in a business suit.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.102
Okay, not to be insensitive,
but Granger did say

09:31.104 --> 09:33.605
that Goodsell suffered multiple
traumatic brain injuries.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.775
I know guys with TBI
who can't tie their shoelaces.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.977
Goodsell looks quick,
purposeful.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.779
He's working an op.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.414
Question is-- for whom?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.048
This area he's covering is full
of government agencies.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.884
You got the DEA, the USCIS.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.954
There's even a
federal courthouse.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.989
He could be working
for a foreign agency.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.993
The sushi manager doesn't know
anything about him?

09:54.995 --> 09:57.896
No, and the shelters we talked
to don't recognize him, either.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.799
But maybe their clients will.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.734
I mean, homeless people don't
like to talk to law enforcement,

10:02.736 --> 10:04.002
but they do talk to each other.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.905
As do the suits
grabbing coffee at the park.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.507
So, maybe
that's our plan.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.108
You go doll up with your
casual business wear,

10:10.110 --> 10:12.043
and I'll get Artie
out of the freezer.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.278
We'll make a
day of it.
Oh.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.813
I'm sorry,
who's Artie?

10:14.815 --> 10:17.349
He named his smelly
undercover jacket.

10:17.351 --> 10:19.017
DEEKS: I did.
It's a funny story, actually.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.269
'Cause when
Actually,

10:20.270 --> 10:21.520
we were...
it's not,
it's really gross.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.771
So, let's go,
get out of here.

10:22.772 --> 10:24.022
I wore that thing,
it gave me a rash.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.390
That's part of
its authenticity, man.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.959
Where's your dedication
to the art form?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.294
You thinking what
I'm thinking?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.262
I'm trying not
to think about your rash.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.665
CALLEN: If Goodsell didn't
have a breakdown,

10:33.667 --> 10:35.200
then either Granger got
bad information...

10:35.202 --> 10:36.735
Or he lied to us.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.105
Where's Granger?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.806
He went out.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.074
Didn't say where.

10:52.019 --> 10:56.221
Mr. Hanna, your daughter
called me twice this morning.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.424
I told her not to use
your number unless
it was an emergency.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.059
Oh, but it was.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.827
She said, um,

11:02.829 --> 11:03.962
Forget the spaghetti.

11:03.964 --> 11:07.098
She'd rather have lasagna
for dinner.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.034
Ouch. I mean,

11:09.036 --> 11:11.002
twice the prep, not to mention
the cook time, of course.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.303
All right, good.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.973
Well, the quicker we solve
this case, the better.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.274
Oh, yes.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.743
The elusive Grey Man.

11:18.745 --> 11:21.680
Unfortunately, Owen has, um,

11:21.682 --> 11:25.150
revoked my access on this case.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.951
Why would he do that?
I think

11:26.953 --> 11:28.319
you'll have to ask him.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.722
I overheard him
say something

11:30.724 --> 11:33.958
about going out to have froyo

11:33.960 --> 11:37.829
with his good friend,
Claude Rains.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.498
"Claude Rains"?

11:39.499 --> 11:41.166
Isn't that the actor
from<i> Casablanca? </i>
Yes.

11:41.168 --> 11:44.135
And<i> Notorious </i>
and<i> The Invisible Man</i>

11:44.137 --> 11:47.072
and<i> Mr. Smith Goes</i>
<i> to Washington.</i>

11:47.074 --> 11:48.807
Quite a career
Mr. Rains had.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.075
Hetty?

11:50.077 --> 11:52.310
Pretty sure he's dead.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.846
True.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.449
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

11:57.451 --> 12:00.785
you can't have froyo with him.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.212
¶ ¶

12:36.189 --> 12:38.123
Oh...

12:38.125 --> 12:40.125
Just keep moving, Barnes.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.326
Just pretend
we're still old friends.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.161
We were never
friends, Granger.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.131
You're right. My mistake.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.433
So, this is

12:48.435 --> 12:50.769
about our Grey Man,
isn't it? (grunts)

12:50.771 --> 12:53.138
I want to hear the truth,
Barnes, straight

12:53.140 --> 12:55.240
from your lying mouth.
The truth?

12:55.242 --> 12:58.143
Since when is the CIA in
the truth-telling business?

12:58.145 --> 13:00.044
Fine.

13:00.046 --> 13:03.214
Then we'll just pick up where
we left off in Afghanistan.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.516
No weapons.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.218
No tricks.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.891
Just you and me.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.531
(grunts)

13:21.067 --> 13:22.400
CALLEN:
Ouch!

13:22.402 --> 13:25.537
Believe it or not,
you landed on Robert Ripley.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.240
(grunting)
Get up.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.144
All right, hand him over.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.380
Yeah, how about we make a trade?

13:35.382 --> 13:37.348
That's not how this works.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.017
Today it is.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.518
Him for some answers.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.520
I guess

13:42.522 --> 13:44.422
we're both in the truth-telling
business now, huh, Granger?

13:44.424 --> 13:45.456
Shut up.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.525
Put your hands
behind your back.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.465
Hey.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.268
Hi, sir...

13:57.270 --> 13:59.204
with the bubble wrap?

13:59.206 --> 14:00.972
Sir, I see you're very busy.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.408
I'm just wondering if
you'd seen my buddy?

14:03.410 --> 14:05.343
That's him on the left.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.578
We served together
in Afghanistan.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.314
And he said he was gonna be
living down here.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.548
No?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.218
Okay. You...

14:13.220 --> 14:14.252
Kensilina?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.286
I'm striking out here.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.387
No one remembers Goodsell.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.889
Or they're too, uh...

14:17.891 --> 14:21.559
disturbed or too high
to remember anything.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.895
KENSI:
Hey, he left his wallet on the
table and I tried the address,

14:23.897 --> 14:25.864
but he doesn't live there
anymore-- do you know him?
Nah. No.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.332
No? Okay, thank you.
I can't...

14:27.334 --> 14:28.933
Sorry.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.636
Have any luck
down there, Kens?

14:31.638 --> 14:34.038
That would be a negative.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.974
And I'm on my third
cup of coffee.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.909
I'm not sure how much
my bladder can it take anymore.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.410
I could kill
for a cup of coffee right now.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.079
You want to switch me?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.214
And put on that jacket?
No, thank you.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.216
I wouldn't let Artie touch me.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.551
Well, I'll have you know

14:46.553 --> 14:48.953
that you're not really
Artie's type anyway.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.595
I used to be.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.364
What?

14:59.366 --> 15:01.266
What do you mean?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.202
You know, I lived on the street

15:04.204 --> 15:06.504
down here after my dad died?

15:08.308 --> 15:09.941
Um, no.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.476
No, I didn't, uh...

15:11.478 --> 15:13.011
No, I didn't know that.

15:13.013 --> 15:16.281
You're lying to me.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.349
I know Hetty told you.
Hetty?

15:18.351 --> 15:19.984
No, come on.
Hetty didn't tell me anything.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.352
Actually, she specifically said

15:21.354 --> 15:23.955
that she didn't
tell me anything.

15:23.957 --> 15:27.191
You can fool
everyone else, Deeks.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.260
Can't fool me.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.000
So, you want to talk about it?

15:38.638 --> 15:40.138
Not really.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.110
Like it was even me anymore.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.947
Just a...

15:48.949 --> 15:51.683
just a different person.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.552
Well, I wish
I would've known her.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.191
No, you don't.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.061
Excuse me...

16:03.063 --> 16:04.295
sir, I'm looking for somebody...

16:04.297 --> 16:06.397
Uh, it's not gonna...

16:09.669 --> 16:11.703
His name's Paul Barnes, CIA.

16:11.705 --> 16:15.073
He handled Goodsell's
covert ops.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.041
You think he had him killed?

16:17.043 --> 16:18.276
Why?

16:18.278 --> 16:21.512
He led the manhunt
for Jack Simon in Afghanistan.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.014
The White Ghost mission.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.082
Since then,

16:24.084 --> 16:25.583
I've been keeping tabs
on Barnes.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.252
So, when I learned he flew
into town last night,

16:28.254 --> 16:30.121
I started looking
for reasons why.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.324
Friend at the DoD
tipped me off to Goodsell.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.526
And like Simon,
Goodsell's a special operative

16:35.528 --> 16:37.228
who'd gone off the grid.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.197
But he didn't have a breakdown.
No.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.498
That was just the cover story.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.600
Goodsell went AWOL
last November.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.335
The CIA lost him.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.437
That's why you kept Hetty
on the sidelines.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.272
Because of the way she
handled Afghanistan.

16:48.274 --> 16:51.542
I was trying to protect her from
another inter-agency quagmire.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.579
But as usual, she couldn't
resist stirring the pot.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.714
You're too close to this.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.750
Meaning what, Agent Hanna?

16:58.752 --> 17:00.685
Meaning we'll handle
the interrogation.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.625
All right.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.028
Five minutes.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.640
There are a handful
of Grey Men out there.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.576
But none of them were
like Goodsell.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.346
You know, I worked with the guy
for over a decade,

17:28.348 --> 17:30.181
and I couldn't tell you
the first thing about him.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.284
No personal connection.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.553
Makes it easier
to have him killed.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.555
(laughs)
Nicely done.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.724
I like how you turned
that around on me.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.659
The only problem is
I didn't do it.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.528
Although I will admit
that the world is

17:43.530 --> 17:45.563
a safer place with him dead.
CALLEN:
All right.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.631
So, if you're not
here for the hit,

17:46.633 --> 17:47.799
why are you here?

17:47.801 --> 17:49.734
Hmm?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.803
Is this a vacation?

17:51.805 --> 17:53.638
(laughs)
Ha-hardly.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.673
I hate Los Angeles.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.242
I hate the people.
I hate the sun.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.710
You know, I got sunburned
so badly in Afghanistan

17:59.712 --> 18:01.813
that I had to be hospitalized.

18:01.815 --> 18:03.147
SAM: Okay, this is
a waste of time.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.315
Let's bring Granger in.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.817
Okay, relax, relax, relax.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.819
Relax.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.354
Let's everybody take
a deep breath.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.523
(exhales)

18:14.627 --> 18:17.829
The reason that I am here
is because yesterday

18:17.831 --> 18:21.399
Goodsell contacted me
through one of his old handles.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.871
You don't believe me,
check my phone.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.144
You try and wipe this...

18:33.146 --> 18:34.913
I know, I know.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.681
You'll let Granger
come in here and kill me.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.683
Believe me, Agent Callen.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.752
I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.702
"Need to meet tomorrow,

18:57.704 --> 18:58.870
"Los Angeles.

18:58.872 --> 19:01.305
You help me, I'm back in."

19:01.307 --> 19:03.875
Goodsell may have been
valuable dead.

19:03.877 --> 19:07.311
But he was much more
valuable alive.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.515
I came here to bring him in.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.754
He also sent you photos.
Who are they?

19:16.756 --> 19:19.257
Uh, the women, I don't know.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.626
Although I wish I did.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.328
The men,
they're from the Peña Cartel.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.897
SAM:
Did Goodsell

19:25.899 --> 19:27.498
operate inside of Mexico?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.666
Mm-mm.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.234
Interact with the cartels?

19:30.236 --> 19:32.370
Never. Never.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.840
But I don't think our Grey Man
died for old secrets.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.776
I think they killed him
for something new.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.255
DEEKS:
Wow, you're, like,

19:51.257 --> 19:52.924
assaulting that burger.

19:52.926 --> 19:53.791
KENSI:
You have no idea.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.760
It's so good.
Yeah, wow.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.495
Go easy.
Mmm.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.932
It looks pretty delicious.
Why?

20:00.934 --> 20:02.700
You hungry?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.669
Yeah, I'm starving.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.704
French...

20:06.706 --> 20:07.772
Oh, you're offering...?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.540
You want me to have...?
Thank you.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.775
French fry.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.710
It's still warm.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.513
Getting free french fries
over here.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.551
Hey, so, I'm looking
for my, uh,

20:20.553 --> 20:22.453
my buddy.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.956
We were in the war together.
This is him. You haven't...?

20:24.958 --> 20:26.857
You haven't seen this guy?
My buddy, have you seen...?

20:26.859 --> 20:28.459
You're not listening to me.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.860
MAN:
Good day, miss.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.696
Oh, that's why you're not...

20:31.698 --> 20:32.730
Good day.
You want me to stand?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.349
Yeah, I'll stand.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.967
What do we, what do we do now?
Hats off.
Good day, miss.

20:35.969 --> 20:38.903
Fine weather we're having.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.305
My, don't you look lovely.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.341
You look lovely.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.942
We think you look lovely.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.711
MAN:
We do.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.878
DEEKS:
Wow, dinner and a show.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.714
Well done, old-timer.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.616
You got the world
figured out here, don't you?

20:51.618 --> 20:54.252
Another french fry.
Don't mind if I do.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.290
Deeks, check out the woman
in the red skirt.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.461
DEEKS:
Uh, it's hard not to.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.630
KENSI:
Calm down.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.632
I got pictures from ops
of two women

21:07.634 --> 21:08.933
who might be linked
to the Peña Cartel.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.601
She's one of them.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.937
Wow, yeah. She's a hot tamale.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.705
KENSI:
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

21:14.707 --> 21:15.773
See those guys she's joining?

21:15.775 --> 21:16.941
I was checking them out earlier.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.442
They got badges
and concealed weapons.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.977
They're DEA.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.648
Looks like Goodsell wasn't
the only spy working the area.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.616
KENSI:
Want to know
why the Grey Man died?

21:25.618 --> 21:28.719
I say we start with her.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.533
ERIC:
We put Goodsell's photos
through facial rec.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.735
We I.D.'d the first woman
as Bonnie Flores.

21:44.737 --> 21:48.572
She has prior run-ins
with LAPD for prostitution.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.574
She's currently
at the Grand Park food court.

21:50.576 --> 21:52.376
Kensi and Deeks
are keeping an eye on her.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.844
What about the second woman?

21:53.846 --> 21:54.945
It's, uh, not a clear shot.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.315
So nothing on facial rec so far.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.383
Any connection to
the Peña Cartel?
ERIC:
No.

21:59.385 --> 22:00.918
And since
Mexico arrested

22:00.920 --> 22:02.787
Domingo Peña
seven months ago,

22:02.789 --> 22:05.356
the cartel's been
relatively quiet.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.991
Now, Peña's nickname is El Ojo,

22:06.993 --> 22:08.526
or The Eye.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.994
One, because, well,

22:09.996 --> 22:11.796
he wears an eye patch.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.664
Which, for the record,
he didn't even need.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.533
Just thought it
made him look tough.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.601
NELL:
And two, because
he has eyes

22:17.603 --> 22:19.503
everywhere in
the Mexican government,

22:19.505 --> 22:21.639
aiding in his drug empire.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.407
The DEA and the U.S. Attorney's
Office have been working

22:23.409 --> 22:26.677
to extradite Peña from Mexico
ever since his arrest.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.012
Kensi said the woman

22:28.014 --> 22:30.348
was talking to DEA agents
and lawyers.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.615
Cartel could be
trying to target

22:31.617 --> 22:32.883
someone involved
in the Peña case,

22:32.885 --> 22:34.719
hoping to sabotage
the extradition.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.520
Classic honey trap.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.490
Espionage
through seduction.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.925
If we warn the DEA,
they may overreact,

22:40.927 --> 22:42.460
tip off the cartel.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.694
Same thing will happen
if we try to arrest

22:43.696 --> 22:45.129
this woman in
broad daylight.
Yeah.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.764
We need to bring her in

22:46.766 --> 22:47.898
without disturbing the waters.

22:47.900 --> 22:48.966
Hetty.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.534
HETTY:
Gentlemen.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.370
I may have an idea.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.504
Oh, back in the game.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.523
Owen and I

22:55.524 --> 22:57.541
have, uh, reached
an understanding.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.577
This is one cat

22:59.579 --> 23:01.479
you don't put in a bag.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.814
Meet me in wardrobe.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.516
Okay.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.790
(camera shutter clicks)

23:12.792 --> 23:14.759
Eric, I'm sending you
another photo now.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.128
DEEKS:
All right, Kensilina,

23:17.130 --> 23:18.129
I'm ready.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.163
Ready for what?

23:19.165 --> 23:20.164
My homeless act.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.532
How am I doing? Hit me.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.567
A "B."

23:23.569 --> 23:25.703
A "B"...
All right, I'll take that.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.670
Minus.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.072
B-minus?
Aw, come on!

23:28.074 --> 23:29.073
KENSI:
Come on?

23:29.075 --> 23:30.674
Artie's doing all the work.

23:30.676 --> 23:31.776
You're just, uh...

23:31.778 --> 23:33.844
riding his coattails.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.646
Wow. Riding his coa...
You should be ashamed

23:35.648 --> 23:37.081
for that play on words.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.783
Now there is something
you don't see every day.

23:38.785 --> 23:39.850
What?

23:40.820 --> 23:42.086
Look...

23:42.088 --> 23:44.155
it's under Mexican
jurisdiction.

23:44.157 --> 23:45.189
it's as simple
as that.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.440
There's nothing
simple about it.

23:46.441 --> 23:47.690
He will never make it
to trial in Mexico.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.660
SAM:
You don't know that.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.212
You want
to bet?

23:51.213 --> 23:52.763
Peña will be out on
bail within one week.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.665
SAM:
Look, all I'm saying

23:54.667 --> 23:56.567
is it'll mean something
to the people there.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.702
It's not gonna mean anything

23:57.703 --> 23:58.836
if the guy doesn't
make it to trial!

23:58.838 --> 24:00.738
I'm sorry.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.939
My friend's a little stressed.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.441
My apologies.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.542
CALLEN:
I'm not stressed.
Yeah.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.709
I'm fine.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.745
I'm sorry.
Stressed.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.747
Sounds like you two
could use a break.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.982
Oh, you have no idea.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.887
Ooh, taking the bait.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.722
DEEKS:
Wow, that skirt is working.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.524
You should probably
borrow that from her.

24:20.526 --> 24:21.792
(Southern accent):
You'd look real nice.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.194
Finer than a new set
of snow tires.

24:23.196 --> 24:24.195
Stop talking.

24:24.197 --> 24:25.796
DEEKS (Southern):
All right.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.264
Bonnie.
Hi.

24:27.265 --> 24:28.731
I'm an admin assistant
in the IRS office.

24:28.734 --> 24:29.733
How you doing?
Ouch.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.769
I thought we had it tough.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.737
What do you do?

24:33.739 --> 24:35.840
DEA.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.744
Keep that between us.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.146
(giggles)

24:43.783 --> 24:45.683
So are you working on

24:45.685 --> 24:46.884
something secret?

24:46.886 --> 24:48.719
KENSI:
You know what that is?

24:48.721 --> 24:50.721
That's A-plus undercover work.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.790
I'll give 'em that.
That was smooth.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.692
Don't be jealous of
those coats, Artie,

24:54.694 --> 24:57.027
just because they're new
and probably don't smell

24:57.029 --> 24:58.529
like a dead buffalo.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.530
You've got character, all right?

24:59.532 --> 25:00.831
You're pretty. I like you.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.131
You are talking
to your clothing.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.667
You know what?
I stand corrected.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.135
You do belong down here.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.705
SAM:
You know what, you're right.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.540
I do need a break.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.775
Or a drink.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.711
You free?

25:14.680 --> 25:17.014
I might have some free time.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.716
Who's buying?

25:18.718 --> 25:21.185
Uncle Sam, naturally.
(giggles)

25:25.858 --> 25:29.527
I haven't done
anything wrong.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.629
I kept my clothes on
and no money changed hands.

25:31.631 --> 25:34.598
We're not concerned with
your escort work, Bonnie.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.800
It's your tradecraft
that interests us.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.202
My what?

25:38.204 --> 25:40.004
The past few months,

25:40.006 --> 25:41.572
you've targeted DEA agents,

25:41.574 --> 25:44.041
State Department officials,
even a judge's clerk.

25:44.277 --> 25:45.876
You want to tell us why?

25:47.213 --> 25:49.013
Men in high-stress jobs,

25:49.015 --> 25:50.314
little free time...

25:50.316 --> 25:52.082
they make the best clients.

25:52.084 --> 25:55.152
I work where the need
is greatest.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.922
And there's a lot of need there.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.992
In here, too.

26:01.994 --> 26:05.095
You two look like you haven't
had any in awhile.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.866
I think you're confusing horny
with hungry.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.668
We skipped lunch today.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.002
Tried to eat,

26:12.004 --> 26:13.804
couldn't keep anything down.
Yeah.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.873
Not after looking at these.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.275
This is what's left of the women

26:18.277 --> 26:20.244
that work with
the Peña Cartel.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.349
Not much, is there?

26:26.986 --> 26:28.319
SAM:
Look.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.754
You can be tough, Bonnie.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.123
But tough only
gets you so far.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.228
It was a normal job.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.798
I got a call about a man.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.232
A regular.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.702
But when I got there,
it wasn't him.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.771
There were
four of them.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.307
And they made it very clear

26:50.309 --> 26:52.643
that I couldn't say no.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.679
What were your instructions?

26:55.681 --> 26:57.114
They told me
who to target.

26:57.116 --> 27:01.018
Make conversation,
steal documents.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.753
Tablets, cell phones...
anything to do

27:02.755 --> 27:04.221
with the Peña Cartel.
Did they say

27:04.223 --> 27:06.156
what they were going to use
the information for?

27:10.396 --> 27:12.363
SAM:
Bonnie...

27:15.635 --> 27:17.401
Do you know her?

27:17.403 --> 27:20.004
Only by her first name.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.071
What is it?

27:21.073 --> 27:22.239
Monica.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.375
She used to work the park,
like me,

27:24.377 --> 27:26.744
but later she just focused
on one guy.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.812
ERIC:
<i> Kevin Turner.</i>

27:28.814 --> 27:31.415
He's the federal
prosecutor

27:31.417 --> 27:33.250
leading the case
against Domingo Peña.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.652
If the cartel
gets to him,

27:34.654 --> 27:36.286
we can kiss
extradition good-bye.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.421
Now, his office says

27:37.423 --> 27:38.822
he left the courthouse
after lunch,

27:38.824 --> 27:40.758
claiming he had
a family emergency.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.893
Only problem is:
Turner doesn't have any family.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.262
No children, his mom
died last year

27:45.264 --> 27:47.064
and his dad was never
in the picture.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.766
His car is currently parked
outside his home in Hollywood.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.040
(sighs)
Hey, uh...

27:56.042 --> 27:57.374
Kevin, it's Hank from next door.

27:57.376 --> 28:00.711
I got some of your bills
accidentally.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.182
Hey, Kev!

28:05.184 --> 28:06.984
These, uh, these bills
look important.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.086
Like overdue
bills, like,

28:09.088 --> 28:10.954
"they're gonna shut off
your water" kind of bills.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.358
Ooh. Ouch.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.260
Uh, you okay?

28:16.262 --> 28:17.928
Uh, fine.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.196
You have some of my mail?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.998
Yeah.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.867
This got put into my mailbox
by mistake.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.838
Thanks. Um...

28:27.840 --> 28:28.872
it's just the two?

28:28.874 --> 28:30.841
Just the two.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.443
KENSI (over earwig):
Callen and Sam,

28:32.445 --> 28:34.178
I got a guy in the dining room.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.946
Got it.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.218
CALLEN:
I got the second, Sam.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.720
On my mark.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.021
DEEKS:
So, listen,
Jeanie was thinking about

28:44.023 --> 28:45.022
having a potluck...

28:45.024 --> 28:46.757
CALLEN:
Now.

28:46.759 --> 28:47.991
Federal agents!

28:51.363 --> 28:54.765
(grunts)

29:00.172 --> 29:01.171
Clear!

29:01.173 --> 29:02.172
DEEKS:
Go ahead, take a seat.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.475
You all right?

29:04.477 --> 29:06.443
Yeah, I'm okay.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.179
I'm good.

29:09.181 --> 29:10.481
How did you know?

29:10.483 --> 29:13.317
If the cartel wants to stop
Peña's extradition,

29:13.319 --> 29:15.185
they gotta stop you first.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.521
But it's already happening.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.124
What are you talking about?

29:20.126 --> 29:22.493
We finalized the extradition
days ago.

29:22.495 --> 29:24.528
Peña's on his way to L.A.
as we speak.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.432
We've been looking
at this the wrong way.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.768
They're gonna try to free Peña.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.148
TURNER:
Before I became a prosecutor,

29:44.150 --> 29:47.217
I worked as a lawyer
for the DEA.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.852
I would go on raids with them,

29:48.854 --> 29:50.854
make sure they followed
the rule of law.

29:50.856 --> 29:52.990
Saw a lot of action.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.159
Never thought I'd get
caught up in it like this.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.960
What did they want?

29:56.962 --> 29:58.796
Peña's transport route.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.330
The DEA is
taking him straight

30:00.332 --> 30:01.832
from the airport
to the courthouse

30:01.834 --> 30:03.000
for initial arraignment.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.468
Arraignments have
to be conducted

30:04.470 --> 30:06.470
within 48 hours
of arrests, yeah.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.338
And we didn't
want any delays.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.041
It was all kept hush-hush
to prevent leaks.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.576
Too late for that.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.344
So what did you tell them?
Nothing.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.013
I don't know
the transport route.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.015
I don't even know which airport
he's flying into.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.317
You know her?

30:21.287 --> 30:23.320
Monica Lee.

30:25.558 --> 30:26.890
SAM:
You know where
she lives?

30:26.892 --> 30:27.891
CALLEN:
Eric, try Monica Lee.

30:27.893 --> 30:29.059
No, I...

30:29.061 --> 30:30.861
We only went
on a couple of dates.

30:30.863 --> 30:34.264
It was just... harmless fun.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.466
Least I thought it was.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.235
Eric's got an address
for Monica Lee.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.103
Kensi and Deeks
are on their way.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.271
(door opens)

30:42.975 --> 30:44.107
MAN:
Damn it, Turner.

30:44.109 --> 30:45.442
Peña lands in 15 minutes,

30:45.444 --> 30:46.844
and you almost blow
the whole thing

30:46.846 --> 30:48.312
'cause you can't keep it
in your pants.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.880
GRANGER:
This is DEA Agent

30:49.882 --> 30:51.481
Mario Sanchez.

30:51.483 --> 30:54.218
Thank you for all you've done.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.220
We gotta get moving.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.354
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.589
Where you going?

30:58.591 --> 31:00.357
I've got to see
this through.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.892
I'm not gonna
let them stop me

31:01.894 --> 31:03.193
through intimidation.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.561
You're still in danger.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.096
SANCHEZ:
I can assure you
he'll be safe.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.564
We changed
the transport route

31:07.566 --> 31:09.099
and increased security
around the courthouse.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.535
Nothing's gonna happen
on my watch.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.270
Well, that's funny.
Because this

31:13.272 --> 31:15.239
looks a lot like
you cozying up

31:15.241 --> 31:17.107
to a cartel prostitute.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.978
Well, she didn't get
any intel from me.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.080
Now if you don't mind,
this is a DEA matter.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.365
What's your rush?

31:24.366 --> 31:25.649
48 hours isn't up.
GRANGER:
Tell you what.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.451
You take Turner
to the courthouse.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.453
Sanchez and I are gonna
have a little talk,

31:29.455 --> 31:30.654
if that's all right with you.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.660
NELL:
Yeah, Kens?

31:36.662 --> 31:38.929
Nell, we're at
Monica Lee's place

31:38.931 --> 31:40.964
and so are the police.
She's missing.

31:40.966 --> 31:43.166
Neighbor called it in when
she noticed the door was open.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.167
There are signs of a struggle.

31:44.169 --> 31:45.269
Okay.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.037
I'll scan traffic cams.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.605
Can we narrow down
the time frame at all?

31:48.607 --> 31:50.107
Around 11:00
last night.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.308
All right, so
the good news is

31:51.310 --> 31:53.243
that, uh, LAPD's gonna
let us on the scene.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.213
The bad news is that Monica's
got a seven-year-old daughter.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.081
She's missing, too.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.917
Geez. Nell...

31:59.919 --> 32:00.951
Yeah, I heard, Kens.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.920
I'm searching as fast as I can.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.288
(phone chimes)

32:04.290 --> 32:06.156
Check out this text
my daughter just sent me.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.157
"Hanna FTW."

32:07.159 --> 32:09.126
"Hanna for
the win."

32:09.127 --> 32:11.094
And that is a, uh,
protractor emoji.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.162
That means she aced
her math test.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.297
I know what it says,

32:13.299 --> 32:14.631
but why doesn't
she just say that?

32:14.633 --> 32:15.632
She is, it's just
a different language.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.100
It's not
a different language.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.468
It's laziness.
Speak for
yourself.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.038
I'll take Tween
over Tagalog any day.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.306
Eric,
you find Monica?

32:22.308 --> 32:23.741
Uh, still missing,

32:23.742 --> 32:25.175
but I might have
something on Turner.

32:25.176 --> 32:26.609
Now, it could be nothing,
but I kept digging into

32:26.612 --> 32:29.313
his background,
and I realized he's got

32:29.315 --> 32:31.248
a lot in common with Goodsell's
Grey Man pattern.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.449
I mean, both guys

32:32.451 --> 32:34.584
ate at the same
sushi place.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.287
So I did a little more digging.

32:37.289 --> 32:41.959
Turner's mother was living
in Oceanside 33 years ago,

32:41.961 --> 32:43.260
at the same time that Goodsell

32:43.262 --> 32:45.262
was stationed right nearby
at Pendleton.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.364
Now, she died last year.

32:47.366 --> 32:50.334
But when I pulled her will
from the public record,

32:50.336 --> 32:52.235
guess who was named in it.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.637
Goodsell.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.238
She left him
an envelope.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.708
And I don't know what was
in it, but my guess is...

32:57.710 --> 32:59.309
Tell him about their son,

32:59.311 --> 33:00.711
Kevin Turner.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.179
ERIC: A week after
Turner's mother died,

33:02.181 --> 33:04.681
Goodsell went AWOL from the CIA.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.616
HETTY:
He was watching over his son

33:06.618 --> 33:08.585
the entire time.

33:08.587 --> 33:13.023
So, Goodsell's training enabled
him to pick up on the espionage.

33:13.025 --> 33:16.760
But once he saw his son with one
of the women from the cartel,

33:16.762 --> 33:18.261
he got involved.

33:18.263 --> 33:20.664
Broke his cover,
paid with his life.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.666
Turner probably saw
his father every day.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.268
He just didn't know it.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.170
NELL:
Guys?

33:27.172 --> 33:29.272
I have something
you have to see.

33:29.274 --> 33:32.275
Kensi and Deeks just found this
at Monica Lee's house.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.778
Turner said he'd never been
to Monica's place.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.214
That looks like more than
"harmless fun" to me.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.716
Why would a federal prosecutor
lie to us?

33:39.718 --> 33:44.287
The cartel uses Monica
to seduce Turner.

33:44.289 --> 33:47.391
Once she has him hooked,
they take her away.

33:47.393 --> 33:50.327
Then they used her to get
him to finish the job.

33:50.329 --> 33:53.096
But there's no way that Turner
could free Peña all on his own.

33:53.098 --> 33:54.564
But that's not the plan.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.767
I just finished talking
to Agent Sanchez.

33:56.769 --> 33:59.403
He's clean, but the DEA
made a deal with Peña.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.304
In exchange for what?

34:01.306 --> 34:03.373
Peña's gonna give
them the names

34:03.374 --> 34:05.441
of every Mexican official
complicit in the drug trade.

34:05.444 --> 34:08.111
It's the best shot they've ever
had at ending this war.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.649
SAM: So, the cartel
doesn't want their boss freed.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.185
They want him dead.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.320
And Turner's the assassin.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.136
Where are we?

34:33.138 --> 34:34.771
Callen and Sam are
almost at the courthouse.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.106
Agent Sanchez is
already there.

34:36.108 --> 34:37.541
Does he have Turner?

34:37.543 --> 34:40.077
Can't find him, but
Peña's under heavy guard.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.378
NELL:
Guys?

34:41.380 --> 34:43.580
I think I found Monica.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.116
Okay, I spotted this van
near Monica's place last night

34:46.118 --> 34:48.085
around the time
of her abduction.

34:48.087 --> 34:51.088
Now, it's the same van
in Goodsell's photos.

34:51.090 --> 34:55.125
And Kaleidoscope just picked
it up an hour ago parked here.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.593
It's a shut-down restaurant
in North Hollywood.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.161
Peña cartel's had a foothold
there for years.

34:58.163 --> 34:59.162
NELL:
Exactly.

34:59.164 --> 35:01.231
Kensi and Deeks
are in the area.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.100
I'll send them now.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.139
Torres, I need eyes on Turner.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.707
Torres?!

35:12.144 --> 35:14.311
The agent assigned to Turner
has been found unconscious.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.813
His weapon's gone.
Turner know how to use it?

35:16.815 --> 35:18.849
I've been on raids
with him, he's trained.
(alarm sounds)

35:18.851 --> 35:20.150
(alarm sounds)

35:20.152 --> 35:21.451
Fire alarm.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.886
It's not a drill.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.555
Agents are reporting smoke
on the second floor.

35:25.557 --> 35:26.890
That's Turner.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.725
What's the protocol
in case of fire?

35:28.726 --> 35:30.559
They're gonna take Peña out the
same way they brought him in--

35:30.562 --> 35:31.628
through the underground
parking garage.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.630
This way.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.638
(tires squeal)

35:42.741 --> 35:44.207
CALLEN:
Federal agents!

35:44.209 --> 35:45.175
SAM: Federal agents.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.543
It's Peña.

35:46.545 --> 35:47.811
It's about damn time.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.279
Where the hell
were you?

35:50.249 --> 35:51.314
Back up!

35:51.316 --> 35:53.183
Put 'em down!

35:54.786 --> 35:56.286
Lower your weapons.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.488
It's not gonna happen, Turner.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.290
I have to do this!

36:00.292 --> 36:01.892
If Peña's not dead in
the next five minutes,

36:01.894 --> 36:03.560
they'll kill
Monica and Amy.

36:03.562 --> 36:04.561
PEÑA:
Gustavo...

36:04.563 --> 36:06.730
that traitor.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.465
He put a hit
on his own compadre.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.567
Kevin...
Don't give him the satisfaction!

36:10.569 --> 36:12.335
We know where they're holding
Monica and Amy,

36:12.337 --> 36:14.171
agents are on
their way now.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.405
There's not
enough time.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.806
Yes, there is.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.442
We saved you,
we can save them.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.378
Put the gun down.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.681
KENSI:
See anything?

36:24.683 --> 36:26.349
I got at least
two guys.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.385
They both have
assault rifles.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.420
I don't see Monica
or her daughter.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.322
But there is
a walk-in cooler.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.623
That's where I'd
keep the hostages.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.259
So, we're outgunned,
we got no backup.

36:36.261 --> 36:37.961
And if Turner
doesn't hear Monica

36:37.962 --> 36:39.662
in the next four minutes,
that means that Peña's dead.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.331
What's the plan here?

36:41.333 --> 36:43.600
Why do I always have
to come up with a plan?

36:43.602 --> 36:44.801
What's your plan?

36:44.803 --> 36:46.803
My plan is to live
long and prosper.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.872
You know what I mean?
To make little baby Deeks,

36:48.874 --> 36:51.241
little ninja assassins
with fantastic hair.

36:51.243 --> 36:52.242
Not likely in this job.

36:52.244 --> 36:53.310
(chuckles)

36:56.848 --> 36:59.950
Deeks, the only reason I didn't
tell you about being homeless...

36:59.952 --> 37:02.285
Really? Is this the best time
to have this conversation?

37:02.287 --> 37:04.554
It was the worst period
of my life.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.427
Made a lot of mistakes.

37:10.429 --> 37:13.296
And I only ever want you
to see the best part of me.

37:13.298 --> 37:14.598
Okay?

37:14.600 --> 37:15.999
Okay.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.603
Just to narrow it down
for me, though,

37:19.605 --> 37:21.471
the best part of you,
is that your ankles?

37:21.473 --> 37:22.706
'Cause you've got
pretty sexy ankles.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.641
I mean, your feet,
they're all right.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.243
Your toes are a little weird,
but the rest...

37:26.245 --> 37:27.911
This is exactly
why I never talk to you.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.283
What?

37:33.285 --> 37:35.318
I think I got a plan.

37:38.957 --> 37:39.990
No one's gonna care

37:39.992 --> 37:41.658
if a cartel boss dies.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.260
CALLEN:
You're right, Kevin.

37:43.262 --> 37:44.494
You're right.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.463
But you know whose death
I care about right now?

37:46.465 --> 37:48.765
Harrison Goodsell.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.267
SAM:
Kevin?

37:50.269 --> 37:53.003
Goodsell is how we got
onto the case.

37:53.005 --> 37:55.272
He saw the cartel abduct Monica.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.874
He tried to warn you,
but they killed him.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.342
What are you talk...?

37:59.344 --> 38:00.677
I've never even
seen this guy.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.046
I know, but he's seen you.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.051
It was your father, Kevin.

38:08.053 --> 38:11.321
He died trying
to protect you.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.759
Whoever he was,

38:15.761 --> 38:17.761
he should have tried harder.

38:17.763 --> 38:18.862
Time's up, I'm sorry.
Shoot him!

38:18.864 --> 38:20.497
TURNER: I have to!
Shoot him!

38:20.499 --> 38:22.565
Kevin, stop it!

38:22.567 --> 38:24.701
I'm not gonna let you do this.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.636
I'm not gonna let you
throw your life away.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.340
So, you know what I'm gonna do?

38:33.912 --> 38:35.578
I'll do it.

38:41.787 --> 38:45.488
You just killed Monica and Amy.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.794
(whistling casually)

38:50.796 --> 38:52.796
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

38:52.798 --> 38:55.365
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.367
Unless, of course,
fried cartel is on the menu.

38:57.369 --> 38:58.368
I'm just kidding.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.447
"Fried cartel."

38:59.448 --> 39:00.525
You look really confused
and idiotic,

39:00.526 --> 39:01.603
so let me walk you
through this.

39:01.606 --> 39:03.156
Last few minutes,

39:03.157 --> 39:04.707
this whole room has
been filling up with gas.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.509
(sniffs) Go ahead,
take a whiff, you smell that?

39:06.511 --> 39:07.510
(sniffing)

39:07.512 --> 39:08.611
Huh? You know
what that is?

39:08.613 --> 39:10.013
(sniffs)
That's<i> gasolina.</i>

39:10.015 --> 39:11.081
So, uh...

39:12.718 --> 39:15.985
...so, firing your weapons is
not the chef's recommendation.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.854
What I would suggest,
in contrast to that,

39:17.856 --> 39:19.622
is you put the weapons down.

39:19.624 --> 39:22.025
Let's turn
ourselves in,

39:22.027 --> 39:23.526
go talk about our feelings,
maybe grab a beer,

39:23.528 --> 39:25.028
figure out why our dads
didn't love us enough.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.062
All these things
can be discussed.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.098
If you put those down,
nice and easy.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.132
See?

39:29.134 --> 39:30.500
That was good, right?

39:30.502 --> 39:32.369
Yeah, now we're talking.

39:32.371 --> 39:35.805
We'll just go home, everybody's
gonna be fine with the...

39:35.807 --> 39:36.873
Okay, really?

39:36.875 --> 39:37.907
With the meat cleaver?

39:37.909 --> 39:39.509
Two on one,
you get a...

39:39.511 --> 39:40.944
cleaver.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.846
And now we're gonna fight
with a... plan B!

39:42.848 --> 39:43.747
(yelps)

39:43.749 --> 39:44.881
Plan B!

39:44.883 --> 39:45.915
KENSI:
Deeks!
Plan B!

39:48.420 --> 39:50.453
(explosion)

39:57.896 --> 39:59.629
(grunts)
You okay?

39:59.631 --> 40:00.864
Yeah.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.399
Deeks!

40:02.401 --> 40:03.433
(man yells)

40:05.070 --> 40:06.803
Cooler.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.450
Hey, guys.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.051
How you doing?

40:22.053 --> 40:23.586
No, we're federal agents.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.021
You're safe now.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.556
Let's get you guys
out of here, come on.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.027
CALLEN:
Yeah.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.028
KENSI:
We got Monica.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.563
Kensi, put her on.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.198
Sure.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.133
Monica.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.134
MONICA:
Kevin.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.469
You're okay.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.570
And Amy?

40:40.572 --> 40:42.138
Thank God.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.139
I know, babe.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.607
I-I know everything.

40:44.609 --> 40:45.775
It's gonna be okay.

40:45.777 --> 40:46.943
MONICA:
I love you.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.878
I love...
(phone beeps)

40:48.880 --> 40:51.748
You're, uh, getting
another call.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.017
Hello?

40:54.019 --> 40:55.018
GIRL:
Hey, Uncle Callen.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.586
How's it going?

40:56.588 --> 40:57.787
Hello?

40:57.788 --> 40:58.987
Why is your daughter
calling my phone?

40:58.990 --> 41:00.657
You seem to understand
her so well,

41:00.659 --> 41:03.092
I figured Uncle Callen should
be one of her contacts.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.029
You know, in
case of emergency.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.032
You gonna ignore my daughter?

41:09.034 --> 41:10.600
What if she's in trouble?

41:13.572 --> 41:16.606
Banana Hanna,
everything all right?

41:17.576 --> 41:19.542
Oh, yeah?

41:20.745 --> 41:22.579
I hear you aced your
geometry quiz today.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.514
That's a good job.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.251
Is your dad gonna be home
in time to make lasagna?

41:31.022 --> 41:32.956
Don't you worry about your dad.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.891
He will always be there for you.

41:43.735 --> 41:47.604
The paperwork can wait,
Mr. Callen.

41:47.606 --> 41:48.605
Go home.

41:48.607 --> 41:50.840
Take Joelle
out to dinner.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.008
Uh, she's busy.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.843
She's got her parents in town.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.845
Huh.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.847
I see.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.682
You met them, yet?

42:18.703 --> 42:22.906
Why didn't Goodsell
ever reveal himself?

42:25.176 --> 42:27.577
Not to his own son.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.780
Why didn't
he say anything?

42:35.554 --> 42:40.590
Perhaps he was simply
respecting the mother's wishes.

42:42.060 --> 42:45.662
Or perhaps
he wanted to,

42:45.664 --> 42:49.699
but just didn't know how.

42:54.573 --> 42:58.641
That's the thing
about The Grey Man.

43:02.614 --> 43:04.614
He never reveals
his secrets.
