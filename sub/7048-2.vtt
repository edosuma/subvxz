WEBVTT

00:09.433 --> 00:10.465
Come on, Mary.

00:20.403 --> 00:21.813
Man.

00:21.946 --> 00:24.235
He ain't been dead long enough
to be stinking like that.

00:24.365 --> 00:26.025
You think he shit himself?

00:27.159 --> 00:28.570
Maybe you should check.

00:28.703 --> 00:30.161
Maybe I will.

00:31.622 --> 00:34.706
Oh, boy. Yeah, get the lime.
Go and get the lime.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.411
- No, you get it. I'll spring the door.
- Hey!

00:36.711 --> 00:39.415
- Go get the lime.
- I got the crowbar, monkey-nuts. You get it.

00:39.714 --> 00:41.753
What, are you worried that
the lime's too heavy?

00:56.564 --> 00:57.643
Let's go!

01:08.701 --> 01:10.907
How deep you reckon that is?

01:12.955 --> 01:15.991
Why don't you jump in and find out?

01:17.710 --> 01:20.794
How come we gotta use the lime?
No way that stink can travel that far.

01:20.921 --> 01:23.080
'Cause Mama says so.

01:31.098 --> 01:33.257
That's good.

01:58.417 --> 02:01.916
Step out of the hole to find
Raylan Givens waiting for me.

02:02.046 --> 02:05.629
For a second I thought I was 19 again.

02:05.758 --> 02:10.883
Yeah, I was just thinking.
Last time I was down a dog-hole mine

02:11.013 --> 02:15.342
was Myrtle Creek,
you and me running for our lives.

02:16.227 --> 02:21.138
I'll tell you, I'm not afraid of heights,
snakes or red-headed women, but

02:21.273 --> 02:22.981
I am afraid of that.

02:23.108 --> 02:26.857
Yeah, well, not a lot of legal
employment opportunity in Harlan County.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.864
At least not for a man with my skill set.

02:30.991 --> 02:36.864
Besides, wasn't it you that said
I like to get money and blow shit up?

02:37.998 --> 02:39.825
Buy you a drink?

02:40.918 --> 02:45.580
When a Deputy United States Marshal
offers to buy you a drink in a dry county,

02:45.714 --> 02:48.965
a cautious man might turn him down.

02:49.093 --> 02:50.884
Well, you could always
claim entrapment.

02:51.011 --> 02:52.091
- But I take your point.
- Hot apple pie.

02:52.221 --> 02:56.135
What if I said, "Let's drive to a puddle,
and I'll buy you a drink"?

02:56.267 --> 02:58.758
Well, I'd say,
"Cumberland's the closest."

03:00.563 --> 03:02.223
Okay, so...

03:02.356 --> 03:03.519
Bartender...

03:03.649 --> 03:05.558
- Just so we're clear...
- ...let's do that again.

03:05.693 --> 03:07.317
Genie don't go back in the bottle twice.

03:07.611 --> 03:09.818
Anything happens to the niece,
Gio goes scorched-earth...

03:09.947 --> 03:11.489
Is that all you wanted?

03:11.615 --> 03:14.402
Make sure I wasn't gonna
throw any gasoline on the Cuban fire?

03:14.910 --> 03:17.152
Life don't hand out
too many second chances, Boyd.

03:17.288 --> 03:18.830
I just hope you take
advantage of yours.

03:18.956 --> 03:21.873
Gio and his niece
got nothing to fear from me, my friend,

03:22.001 --> 03:24.670
because my outlaw
ways are behind me.

03:24.795 --> 03:26.704
Just you saying that
scares the shit out of me.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.831
- God's honest truth.
- Hold on a second.

03:28.966 --> 03:32.050
The more you say it,
the less I believe it.

03:32.177 --> 03:37.634
Believe it or not, Raylan, all I want
is to do my job and to be left alone.

03:37.766 --> 03:39.391
I hope that's not too much to ask.

03:39.518 --> 03:42.887
Okay. Hold on.
I'm sorry, Art. What is it?

03:43.022 --> 03:46.806
Cumberland, having a conversation
with Boyd Crowder.

03:46.942 --> 03:48.982
Art says hi.

03:50.154 --> 03:51.565
Oh, for...

03:52.656 --> 03:55.693
No, no, no, no. I'll take care of it.
Maybe I can use it.

03:55.826 --> 03:58.364
Yeah. Yeah, tell him...

03:58.495 --> 04:02.363
Tell him I said I appreciate the call,
and I'll get back to him.

04:02.499 --> 04:04.622
Believe me. I'm thinking about it.

04:04.752 --> 04:06.828
- Who's Art?
- My boss.

04:06.962 --> 04:09.453
You mean the man who
hit my hands with a Bible?

04:09.590 --> 04:11.713
You remember.

04:11.842 --> 04:15.341
I'm surprised he hasn't transferred
you, all the trouble you've drawn.

04:15.471 --> 04:17.178
Oh, you think I draw it?

04:17.305 --> 04:18.421
Oh, you think you don't?

04:21.726 --> 04:26.603
I gotta go. We're gonna continue
this conversation another time.

04:26.732 --> 04:29.567
There's nothing to continue,
'cause you'll never believe me.

04:32.571 --> 04:34.196
Bartender?

04:34.323 --> 04:37.443
Let's do that one more time.

05:00.641 --> 05:04.176
Deputy Marshal Givens,
as I live and breathe!

05:04.311 --> 05:05.342
Aunt Helen.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.851
Do you wanna come in
and have a slice of jam cake?

05:07.982 --> 05:09.642
That's tempting, but...

05:09.775 --> 05:11.269
But this isn't a social call.

05:11.402 --> 05:14.568
The monitoring company's saying
Arlo's violated his tether range.

05:15.114 --> 05:17.355
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Arlo!

05:19.243 --> 05:21.485
- Arlo!
- What?

05:21.787 --> 05:23.495
- You're violating!
- I'm what?

05:23.706 --> 05:24.820
You're kidding.

05:24.957 --> 05:29.001
You think I got a camper in the yard
'cause I like the look?

05:29.670 --> 05:30.749
What did you say?

05:31.964 --> 05:36.590
She said, "You're violating."
You're outside your tether range.

05:36.927 --> 05:38.801
I think the skin is infected.

05:39.430 --> 05:42.217
That qualifies for "cruel and unusual."

05:42.349 --> 05:46.133
Yeah, well, if you wanna get it off,
return the 20 grand we gave you.

05:46.270 --> 05:47.812
You gave it to me to give to Bo.

05:47.938 --> 05:49.847
How do I know
what happened to it after that?

05:49.982 --> 05:52.555
- Not my job.
- Not your money. What do you care?

05:53.068 --> 05:56.733
- Get in the house.
- He does, and I'll shoot his other arm.

05:57.323 --> 05:58.354
You told her?

05:58.490 --> 06:01.064
I could always give him a pass for what
he did to Frances and me,

06:01.201 --> 06:03.241
since we both had the
bad sense to choose him,

06:03.370 --> 06:04.864
but betraying his only son?

06:04.997 --> 06:07.239
I don't have to listen to this shit.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.542
- Is my money in there?
- No.

06:09.668 --> 06:11.210
Then that's the wrong way.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.874
You go in there, you're violating.
I'm gonna haul you off to jail.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.714
That's just chicken shit,
and you know it.

06:15.841 --> 06:17.632
- It's 10 feet!
- Tell it to the judge.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.381
Fine. Take me in.
Better than staying here.

06:20.512 --> 06:22.304
All right. Let's go.

06:24.308 --> 06:27.095
- Get in the house.
- Are you gonna be civil with me?

06:27.227 --> 06:29.683
Get in the goddamn house!

06:36.028 --> 06:40.072
You kicked the man out of the house?
He's under house arrest.

06:42.826 --> 06:45.364
Find out where he stashed my money.
Give me a call.

06:45.496 --> 06:48.662
I find out where he stashed the money,
I'm headed for Mexico.

06:48.791 --> 06:51.460
- Thank you!
- And leave Mags Bennett alone!

06:54.379 --> 06:57.167
- I'm sorry?
- I know you went by her store.

06:57.299 --> 07:00.004
- If I did?
- You're perfectly aware of that history.

07:00.135 --> 07:03.220
What the hell you need
to gyrate that for?

07:03.347 --> 07:06.016
What I went down there for
concerns the here and now,

07:06.350 --> 07:07.512
nothing to do with the past.

07:07.643 --> 07:10.050
That'd be a neat trick,
escaping the past.

07:10.187 --> 07:13.022
Mags Bennett is an old lady

07:13.148 --> 07:16.600
helping people with their glaucoma
and stomach upset.

07:16.735 --> 07:19.772
Just growing pot.
That's her only business.

07:19.905 --> 07:22.111
Or is she someone who's gonna
try and step up,

07:22.241 --> 07:24.696
take over where Hunter
and Crowder left off?

07:24.827 --> 07:26.700
Don't think it's gonna be you, old man.
No offence.

07:26.995 --> 07:28.406
Leave her alone.

07:28.539 --> 07:30.412
Listen to your aunt.

07:30.541 --> 07:31.786
Get back in the house!

07:31.917 --> 07:34.490
- I hope you get cancer!
- Already had it!

07:34.628 --> 07:37.166
- I hope you get it again!
- Made it move out of the house!

07:52.062 --> 07:53.521
Morning, honey.

07:53.647 --> 07:54.726
Morning.

07:54.857 --> 07:58.901
- You need anything else, Mum?
- No.

07:59.319 --> 08:02.071
No, no. Now, you go on home now.

08:09.371 --> 08:11.198
How was Doyle's last night?

08:11.331 --> 08:12.874
He has a lovely home.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.203
- His boys are mighty rambunctious.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:16.336 --> 08:19.836
And Sarah-Jean can't cook.
You have your breakfast yet?

08:19.965 --> 08:21.080
Yes, ma'am.

08:21.216 --> 08:22.545
That's good.

08:22.676 --> 08:25.511
Don't wanna be one of them girls
starves herself to death

08:25.637 --> 08:30.845
'cause she thinks a man wants to
cuddle up next to some gristle.

08:30.976 --> 08:32.304
Thirsty?

08:34.605 --> 08:37.356
I got some cider.

08:43.447 --> 08:48.405
I'd say you're a good two years away
from being ready for my apple pie.

08:54.708 --> 08:58.492
I want to apologise for not

08:58.629 --> 09:01.298
protecting you from that pervert
the way I promised.

09:03.133 --> 09:06.716
That boy's just lucky
the Marshals got to him before I did.

09:07.804 --> 09:11.470
He... He really put you in the trunk?

09:13.227 --> 09:14.341
Yeah.

09:15.437 --> 09:19.221
Good Lord,
you must have been terrified.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.732
All alone in the dark.

09:26.448 --> 09:28.524
Could you hear anything?

09:31.036 --> 09:34.405
Mostly just the tyres on the road
and the other cars passing.

09:36.250 --> 09:40.662
And before he put you in the trunk,
he say anything to you then?

09:42.297 --> 09:45.382
Just some of the things
he was gonna do to me.

09:46.468 --> 09:49.220
Yeah, they'll take care of him in prison.

09:49.346 --> 09:54.471
Even the lowliest criminals
don't look kindly on child molesters.

09:54.601 --> 09:57.057
I bet you're wondering why you had to
stay at Doyle's last night

09:57.187 --> 09:59.180
and where your daddy is.

10:00.274 --> 10:01.305
Yeah.

10:01.441 --> 10:08.405
Well, it was on account of the shooting
my boys gave him,

10:08.573 --> 10:09.902
and trapping his foot.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.533
When I heard about that,
I was devastated.

10:14.663 --> 10:19.159
So, I decided to make
it up to your father,

10:19.293 --> 10:22.958
and I sent him down
south for a few weeks,

10:23.088 --> 10:26.837
handle some business for us.

10:26.967 --> 10:30.300
Pays a lot more than
tending that little patch.

10:33.140 --> 10:35.975
Of course, with the feds
sniffing around, we had to

10:36.101 --> 10:39.055
spirit him away under cover of night.

10:39.187 --> 10:42.188
So he couldn't even
wait for you to come home.

10:50.324 --> 10:52.197
You want a little more?

10:52.326 --> 10:53.820
Okay.

11:02.961 --> 11:04.420
I never had a girl.

11:06.757 --> 11:09.876
Just those damn boys.

11:13.722 --> 11:16.177
I'm looking forward to
our time together, Loretta.

12:07.234 --> 12:08.479
What are you doing?

12:08.610 --> 12:13.237
Brown suit, black suit, one, two, three,
four shirts, two pairs of jeans.

12:16.243 --> 12:18.070
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

12:18.203 --> 12:22.664
Just by looking at your closet, one
would think you were a simple man.

12:28.505 --> 12:30.296
Okay. I'm gonna go get some coffee.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.626
- You want some?
- Perfect.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.801
- Perfect what, Winona?
- You.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.139
You're running away.

12:42.269 --> 12:44.261
I just offered to go get some coffee.
How's that running away?

12:44.396 --> 12:46.139
- I just made a simple observation.
- No, you didn't.

12:46.481 --> 12:48.474
You tried to start a fight.

12:48.608 --> 12:50.067
Okay. Raylan?

12:52.070 --> 12:53.648
Are you staying in Kentucky?

12:53.780 --> 12:56.865
They offered me my job back in Miami,
and I'm here. What does that tell you?

12:57.200 --> 12:58.529
Well, you're also still at a place that

12:58.660 --> 13:00.736
puts a piece of paper over the toilet.
So what does that tell me?

13:01.246 --> 13:02.325
That it's sanitised for your protection.

13:02.456 --> 13:04.116
I know how much you make, Raylan.
Come on.

13:04.249 --> 13:06.325
- I'm sorry?
- You can at least rent an apartment.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.417
- Maybe I should buy a house.
- That's...

13:08.545 --> 13:11.499
No, I know the name
of a very good realtor.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.917
You're an asshole.

13:15.594 --> 13:16.839
I'm sorry.

13:19.681 --> 13:22.884
Okay. I'm sorry.

13:23.018 --> 13:27.062
You wanna converse, we'll converse.
You wanna fight, we'll fight.

13:27.189 --> 13:29.146
It's not easy, by any stretch.

13:40.660 --> 13:44.444
Sometimes I look at you,
and I never wanna see you again.

13:48.919 --> 13:50.329
Other times?

13:51.713 --> 13:54.382
There are no other times. Just that.

13:55.884 --> 13:57.508
Raylan,

13:59.971 --> 14:02.593
other times I wanna
run away with you to Costa Rica.

14:02.724 --> 14:04.135
Costa Rica?

14:12.901 --> 14:14.728
I can't be late.

14:15.987 --> 14:17.019
Fine.

14:17.531 --> 14:19.903
But I'm gonna need that shirt.

14:22.786 --> 14:25.193
I hate smelling you on me all day.

14:25.330 --> 14:28.082
Should've taken another shower.

14:30.502 --> 14:33.752
You were the one who
went for the victory lap.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.715
- Well, hello, Raylan! Winona!
- Gary.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.668
You know, I always forget
your office is in this building.

14:38.802 --> 14:41.044
You two run into each other
on the elevator a lot? I guess you must.

14:41.179 --> 14:42.673
No. Not as much as you might think.

14:42.806 --> 14:44.466
My schedule's not very regular.

14:44.599 --> 14:45.595
Hold on just a minute.

14:46.226 --> 14:49.891
Listen, Raylan. I was thinking, you know,
maybe we should get together for a drink.

14:50.313 --> 14:51.594
Why? Why would we do that?

14:51.731 --> 14:53.226
Well, we have something in common.

14:53.358 --> 14:56.976
We both been kicked to the kerb
by this one over here, you know?

14:57.112 --> 15:00.232
Feels like it'd only be right for us to
get together, tell some tales.

15:00.365 --> 15:04.030
You know, how OCD she is,
how loud she snores.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.952
Gary, what are you doing here?

15:06.079 --> 15:07.194
Good to see you both.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.623
Good seeing you, Raylan.

15:10.750 --> 15:14.285
I just wanna let you know I'm planning
to show the house again tonight.

15:14.588 --> 15:16.960
Well, that's fine, but you could have
told me that over the phone.

15:17.090 --> 15:20.376
You know, I misplaced my cell phone.
Can you believe that?

15:20.510 --> 15:22.716
- Anyway, I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

15:22.846 --> 15:24.637
Boy, you smell nice.

15:25.974 --> 15:28.844
Raylan, this isn't a punishment detail.

15:28.977 --> 15:31.764
Jamie Berglund needs a transport.
You need an assignment.

15:31.896 --> 15:34.138
- You don't think you can handle it?
- You wanna do it by yourself?

15:34.274 --> 15:36.812
Hey, maybe get another award.

15:36.943 --> 15:39.980
Raylan's not going by himself.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.144
And, by the way,

15:41.281 --> 15:43.902
you might wanna bring some plastic
and some towels for the backseat

15:44.034 --> 15:46.785
in case everything goes south.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.701
Just the two of you?

15:51.833 --> 15:53.956
I had an instructor at Glynco say that

15:54.085 --> 15:56.208
two Marshals should be enough to
transport King Kong.

15:56.463 --> 15:58.455
- Well, I was just saying, 'cause you got...
- I know.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.049
We know what you were saying.

16:00.175 --> 16:02.214
I need you to initial here and...

16:02.344 --> 16:04.383
Well, I guess you've done this before.

16:04.512 --> 16:07.050
Once or twice.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.514
Ms. Berglund.
I'm Deputy Marshal Gutterson.

16:11.645 --> 16:14.100
- This is Deputy Marshal Givens.
- Hello.

16:14.230 --> 16:18.857
- They told you no leg irons, right?
- We read the new guidelines.

16:18.985 --> 16:21.441
We going to the doctor or a rodeo?

16:26.201 --> 16:28.822
Goodness gracious.

16:28.953 --> 16:30.068
You all right?

16:30.205 --> 16:32.281
I'm not contracting. Don't worry.

16:32.415 --> 16:35.582
I've got a haemorrhoid the size
of a golf ball. How are you?

16:35.710 --> 16:39.293
Well, long as you don't give birth
during the ride, we're fine.

16:39.714 --> 16:42.003
Look at you boys, all nervous.

16:42.967 --> 16:45.375
- You gonna ask?
- Ask what?

16:45.512 --> 16:47.303
How I got pregnant.

16:48.640 --> 16:52.056
I don't remember much from health
class, but I do remember that,

16:52.185 --> 16:56.514
and what
untreated venereal disease looks like.

16:56.648 --> 16:59.400
When I was at Marysville,
I had conjugal with my husband.

17:00.276 --> 17:01.771
Is he taking custody of the baby?

17:01.903 --> 17:04.441
Who, A.J.?
A.J. can't take care of himself.

17:04.571 --> 17:06.280
Well, it's gotta be
better than foster care.

17:06.407 --> 17:09.444
Hey, hey, don't knock foster care.
Look where it got me.

17:20.714 --> 17:22.256
Hey, Alisha. How are you, girl?

17:22.382 --> 17:24.374
- Good morning, Ms. Berglund.
- Good morning.

17:24.509 --> 17:25.540
I'm assuming you know the drill.

17:25.676 --> 17:26.708
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.884
We handle all the ultrasounds
for FMC inmates.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.765
- You get a lot of pregnant women inside?
- Not too many.

17:32.892 --> 17:34.173
If you'd bring Ms. Berglund to
exam room one,

17:34.310 --> 17:36.433
there should be a gown in there
for her to put on.

17:36.563 --> 17:37.642
Window in exam room one?

17:37.772 --> 17:39.931
- No, sir.
- All right.

17:40.442 --> 17:41.521
You're afraid of...

17:41.651 --> 17:43.774
Do you know the gentleman
who's in your waiting room?

17:43.903 --> 17:48.150
His wife has a dating scan
scheduled for 11:30.

17:48.283 --> 17:49.658
And where is she?

17:49.784 --> 17:51.243
Running late.

17:51.369 --> 17:52.947
You fellas cops?

17:54.205 --> 17:57.788
I couldn't help but notice the young lady
you came in with was all chained up.

17:57.917 --> 18:00.206
Figured if she was your wife,
she wouldn't take too kindly to that.

18:00.545 --> 18:02.004
- Did you find out?
- What's that?

18:02.130 --> 18:03.293
Boy or girl?

18:03.965 --> 18:05.839
- It's a boy.
- This your first?

18:05.967 --> 18:07.212
How could you tell?

18:07.343 --> 18:10.048
You seem a bit jumpy,
if you don't mind me saying.

18:10.180 --> 18:13.097
Don't mind you saying at all.
But honestly, I'm not scared.

18:13.224 --> 18:15.264
Fifteen years old,
I let a coal train run over me.

18:15.769 --> 18:18.556
I was gonna dodge it, but then
I decided to lay down between the rails.

18:18.688 --> 18:21.559
Sixty miles an hour, 80 cars, all about
an inch from the tip of my nose.

18:22.025 --> 18:24.314
During that whole time
I not once blinked my eyes.

18:24.611 --> 18:26.484
See, once you face down a coal train,

18:26.613 --> 18:28.570
facing a loaded gun just
doesn't have the same effect.

18:28.698 --> 18:29.896
Deputy!

18:30.742 --> 18:32.117
Don't try it, partner.

18:32.368 --> 18:34.741
I'll gut-shoot you both
before you clear that holster.

18:40.543 --> 18:41.872
Nice touch making the appointment.

18:42.003 --> 18:45.123
Thank you kindly, there, Marshal.
Guess this ain't my first rodeo.

18:45.548 --> 18:48.419
Sweetheart, why don't you stand
up here next to the Marshals?

18:48.551 --> 18:50.508
And, gentlemen,
why don't you take out your side arms?

18:50.637 --> 18:52.629
You put yours on the ground,
yours right there on the counter.

18:53.056 --> 18:54.633
And then cuff yourselves.

18:57.602 --> 18:59.927
Anybody makes a move,
you shoot her first.

19:03.983 --> 19:05.442
What's the hold-up there, fellas?

19:05.902 --> 19:07.693
Well, I've never had to cuff myself.

19:09.739 --> 19:11.945
Fine.

19:12.575 --> 19:16.193
I'll do it. You do the cowboy's,
and I'll take care of you.

19:23.753 --> 19:26.327
I'm sorry about this, boys.
I hope you understand.

19:28.299 --> 19:29.710
You sure this is the
way you wanna go out?

19:30.552 --> 19:32.877
I'm sure my baby shouldn't have to
ride my rap.

19:42.021 --> 19:43.053
Gotten anything, gentlemen?

19:43.481 --> 19:45.806
A.J. Logan.
That's the husband and baby daddy.

19:45.942 --> 19:48.018
Not either of the guys
that was at the clinic.

19:48.153 --> 19:51.106
Well, we'll bring him in anyway.
What about this guy?

19:52.115 --> 19:54.273
- We have a winner.
- That's the one who pulled.

19:54.409 --> 19:58.537
Jess Timmons. We got him off that print
that we pulled off the cuff. Good job.

19:58.663 --> 20:00.406
Actually, that was Raylan's play.

20:00.540 --> 20:04.205
Jess Timmons is a Louisville hard case.
Two falls.

20:04.335 --> 20:07.040
Last bit was a two-year
stint at Northpoint.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.413
Manslaughter. Paroled June of '07.

20:09.674 --> 20:11.002
Well, who leaked her
appointment time?

20:11.801 --> 20:13.841
The ultrasound techs generally
don't know the schedule,

20:13.970 --> 20:15.298
- but we're going after the...
- Wait a minute.

20:15.763 --> 20:17.341
What about a leak at the prison?

20:17.932 --> 20:20.423
Yeah, warden thinks he runs
a tight enough ship that

20:20.560 --> 20:21.722
he keeps everything in-house.

20:22.228 --> 20:23.604
Well, sure, if the schedule got out,

20:23.730 --> 20:25.936
prisoner could have confederates
set up an ambush.

20:27.692 --> 20:30.527
We're pushing back, believe me.

20:30.653 --> 20:33.738
So what happened?
You didn't suspect a thing?

20:33.865 --> 20:35.774
Too distracted by that big, old belly?

20:35.992 --> 20:38.317
Art, she played the shit out of us.

20:40.830 --> 20:44.994
<i>Oh, boy!
Now, that's a spark to the right!</i>

20:45.126 --> 20:46.953
I thought I told you to
stay away from that window.

20:47.086 --> 20:49.126
Yeah, and I thought you said
he'd be here by now.

20:49.255 --> 20:52.090
Well, he's coming, all right?
He's just waiting till the coast is clear.

20:52.216 --> 20:53.960
Those Marshals are out
beating the bushes right now.

20:54.093 --> 20:56.466
He wouldn't want to lead them to us.

20:57.555 --> 21:00.129
- We make the news yet?
- No, not yet.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.268
What's that?

21:09.317 --> 21:10.941
It's clonidine.

21:12.487 --> 21:17.729
It helps your body tolerate the
anaesthesia. Plus, it should relax you.

21:20.370 --> 21:23.205
- How long were you an EMT for?
- Seven years.

21:23.331 --> 21:24.446
School for that?

21:25.959 --> 21:29.873
There's a training programme, but
it's not like med school or anything.

21:30.004 --> 21:31.796
Give me a hand here.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.594
You get a lot of pregnancy calls?

21:39.722 --> 21:41.715
All the time.

21:42.725 --> 21:47.055
Third most popular,
behind drunks and psych patients.

21:47.897 --> 21:50.933
You ever have one where
they couldn't make it to the hospital,

21:51.067 --> 21:52.858
had to deliver in the ambulance?

21:52.986 --> 21:54.610
Few times.

21:59.701 --> 22:05.039
Did they make it? Survive, I mean?
Mothers and babies?

22:06.207 --> 22:08.615
Listen, you don't got
nothing to worry about.

22:09.794 --> 22:14.123
In a little while, I'll start the propofol.
Hour after that, your baby's out.

22:14.257 --> 22:16.000
Yeah, and an hour after that,

22:16.134 --> 22:18.969
your baby's daddy is gonna be
taking that little girl to her new life.

22:19.095 --> 22:21.218
Oh, not that fast he don't.

22:21.347 --> 22:25.641
In prison, you get to hold her for maybe
a couple of hours, and then she's gone.

22:25.935 --> 22:27.679
That's gotta be rough.

22:28.396 --> 22:31.183
He can have her when
I am good and ready.

22:31.316 --> 22:34.815
Hey, hey, hey. There's no hurry.
You take all the time you like.

22:36.362 --> 22:38.355
Geez, I gotta pee again. Excuse me.

23:01.346 --> 23:04.596
A.J., it's real simple. You tell us where
your friend Jess Timmons is,

23:04.724 --> 23:05.803
and where your wife, Jamie, is,

23:05.933 --> 23:08.175
and life gets way better for you
than if you don't.

23:08.311 --> 23:10.185
Who the hell is Jess Timmons?

23:10.313 --> 23:11.937
It seems I didn't make
it simple enough.

23:12.065 --> 23:14.472
It's understandable.
You want to break out your wife

23:14.609 --> 23:16.067
'cause they won't let
you have the baby.

23:16.235 --> 23:20.447
- Baby?
- What? You just gonna deny everything?

23:20.573 --> 23:23.278
No, hold on. Serious...
Seriously, Jamie's pregnant?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.901
Come on, A.J. Do not waste...

23:26.037 --> 23:29.073
No, no, no, no. Come on. I haven't
seen her since she left Marysville.

23:29.207 --> 23:33.454
I mean, come on, you should know.
There's no conjugals in the federal system.

23:33.711 --> 23:34.992
She's 37 weeks.

23:35.129 --> 23:37.537
That puts the time of conception
around the time of your last conjugal.

23:37.673 --> 23:40.591
No, we didn't do
anything on my last visit.

23:40.718 --> 23:43.636
No, she said she was going federal
and couldn't have conjugals.

23:43.763 --> 23:45.554
There'd be no point in
us staying together.

23:47.558 --> 23:49.681
You didn't do it one last time,
just to say goodbye?

23:50.103 --> 23:53.139
No, I wanted to, but she said
that would just make things sadder.

23:55.316 --> 23:57.439
Could be a regular visitor
that knocked her up.

23:57.568 --> 23:59.857
Wouldn't be the first time that
a couple went at it

23:59.987 --> 24:01.779
in a corner of the
regular visitors' room.

24:01.906 --> 24:04.148
That's bullshit, Art, and you know it.

24:05.952 --> 24:07.861
- Hell, it could be A.J. himself for all we know.
- Chief.

24:07.995 --> 24:09.324
Oh, my gosh.

24:12.834 --> 24:14.873
We don't know that it's a guard.

24:16.629 --> 24:19.547
If it is a guard,
and I say that to keep you happy,

24:19.674 --> 24:21.797
maybe he hired Jess Timmons
to make the grab because

24:21.926 --> 24:23.206
he knew Timmons from inside.

24:23.344 --> 24:26.713
We make a list of all the guards
from here and Marysville,

24:26.848 --> 24:28.591
and we find out
which ones were at Northpoint

24:28.724 --> 24:30.183
when Timmons was doing his bit.

24:30.601 --> 24:32.012
He's coming. Don't worry.

24:32.145 --> 24:34.221
- I ain't worried.
- Well, you were before.

24:34.355 --> 24:39.515
Yeah, well, that was before I
was wasted. This stuff works.

24:39.652 --> 24:42.357
You know, I never did
anything in the inside.

24:42.488 --> 24:47.945
You could get it, but I just
figured, you know, the baby.

24:48.077 --> 24:50.153
You ever been to California?

24:50.288 --> 24:51.402
Why you ask that?

24:51.539 --> 24:56.960
I was just thinking about where I'd go
once baby's off to her new life.

24:57.086 --> 25:00.087
I never been to California.

25:00.214 --> 25:04.923
Yeah, well, it's nice, long as you
stay out there near the ocean.

25:05.052 --> 25:06.132
You get a little further inland,

25:06.262 --> 25:09.014
then you gotta worry about
all the desert and the wetbacks.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.512
You know what? I don't care where I go,

25:11.642 --> 25:14.050
so long as I know
baby's gonna have a good life.

25:14.187 --> 25:17.887
We're all set.
If you wanna step into my office here,

25:18.024 --> 25:20.479
we'll get the IV started
and have you snoring in no time.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.316
I'm gonna go pee one more time.

25:27.200 --> 25:32.111
Oh, my God! My legs feel like rubber.

25:32.246 --> 25:34.488
You know, if I wasn't about
to go through childbirth,

25:34.624 --> 25:36.663
I'd really be enjoying this buzz.

25:57.230 --> 25:58.392
You're gonna kill her, aren't you?

25:59.565 --> 26:01.107
Why you ask me that?

26:40.940 --> 26:42.185
Looks like you could use
a hand there, honey.

26:42.316 --> 26:44.854
- Oh, my... No, let me go!
- Come here! Come here!

26:44.986 --> 26:46.444
Son of a...

26:47.947 --> 26:50.236
Change of plans.
Now that she's tied down, we cut it out.

26:50.449 --> 26:52.940
Oh, my God, no! Please!

26:53.744 --> 26:55.239
I haven't started the propofol yet.

26:55.371 --> 26:57.079
Yeah? Well, she gave that up
when she went out the window.

26:57.206 --> 26:59.827
- Oh, my God, please!
- I can't do it without the anaesthesia.

26:59.959 --> 27:01.667
If you don't, I will.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.288
I mean, you can, Jesse,

27:03.421 --> 27:05.413
- but she'll probably die of shock.
- So?

27:05.548 --> 27:07.955
If she dies before the baby's out,
like as not the baby goes with her.

27:08.092 --> 27:09.467
What about all those
stories you hear, huh?

27:09.593 --> 27:11.088
About how some
batshit-crazy diesel dyke

27:11.220 --> 27:12.880
cuts out her best friend's baby
and raises it as her own?

27:13.055 --> 27:15.593
The news shows never show the
stories where the babies die.

27:15.725 --> 27:18.394
Now, believe me. I've been on 20 runs
like that when I was driving the bus.

27:18.519 --> 27:19.682
I gotta do the propofol.

27:21.022 --> 27:23.014
- How long's that take?
- I got it.

27:25.318 --> 27:27.524
Shut up. Shut up.

27:28.821 --> 27:34.112
Mr. Cosgrove?
You remember us from this morning?

27:34.243 --> 27:37.577
Of course.
Yeah, no, we all heard what happened.

27:37.705 --> 27:40.990
But, I mean, what did happen?

27:41.125 --> 27:43.698
Oh, couple hard cases
got tipped off about the appointment.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.295
They were just set up for us.

27:45.421 --> 27:46.666
You know where that tip came from?

27:46.797 --> 27:48.292
- We're running it down.
- How you doing?

27:48.424 --> 27:50.333
- Yeah, honey...
- I'm good. How are you?

27:50.468 --> 27:52.294
These are the two Marshals.
Remember that thing on the news

27:52.428 --> 27:54.171
- I was telling you about?
- Yeah. Hi. Hi.

27:54.347 --> 27:58.012
Glenn, maybe Mrs. Cosgrove
wants to go back in the house?

27:58.142 --> 28:00.016
Why would I go inside?

28:00.144 --> 28:02.600
- Yeah, why does she need to go inside?
- Why would I need to go inside?

28:02.772 --> 28:04.266
Are you sure you want
her here for this?

28:04.732 --> 28:06.938
Here for what? Glenn, what's going on?

28:07.109 --> 28:09.435
- I have no idea. Let's...
- Mr. Cosgrove.

28:09.570 --> 28:10.768
Take your hands off me, man.

28:10.905 --> 28:13.111
We know about Jess Timmons.
We know he was at Northpoint

28:13.240 --> 28:14.521
- when you were there.
- Who?

28:14.658 --> 28:16.485
How long do you think it'll be
before we find him?

28:16.619 --> 28:19.288
You think he's gonna stand up for you,
just go down with the ship?

28:19.455 --> 28:21.531
I see you believe that I know
what you're talking about, but I...

28:21.707 --> 28:24.625
What about Jamie? You really didn't
think she was gonna tell anybody?

28:24.752 --> 28:27.457
- Tell anybody what?
- You wanna answer that, or should I?

28:27.588 --> 28:29.960
I can't answer that, because I have
no idea what you're talking about.

28:30.091 --> 28:32.130
Okay. Mrs. Cosgrove,

28:32.259 --> 28:35.545
the inmate who escaped today
was eight months pregnant.

28:35.679 --> 28:37.174
- Your husband is the father.
- Are you crazy?

28:37.556 --> 28:39.099
- What?
- Then he hired a convict

28:39.225 --> 28:41.016
that he knew from Northpoint
to help her escape.

28:41.435 --> 28:45.303
Come on. You think my husband
knocked up some inmate,

28:45.439 --> 28:47.895
and helped her escape? And then what?

28:48.025 --> 28:52.070
He's gonna leave me, his job,
everything here, everything,

28:52.238 --> 28:53.400
and then he's gonna, what,
run away with her?

28:53.531 --> 28:57.149
No, we don't think he's gonna run off.
We think he's gonna have her killed.

28:57.660 --> 29:00.115
That's the only way he can be certain
that it doesn't come back to him.

29:00.246 --> 29:01.989
You assholes are gonna
hang out to dry for this.

29:02.123 --> 29:03.783
- I'm gonna get my union rep.
- That can't be true.

29:03.916 --> 29:06.205
- You tell them that's not true.
- Well, of course it's not true!

29:06.335 --> 29:10.380
Glenn, we have over 20 calls between
you and Jess Timmons last week alone.

29:15.678 --> 29:18.632
- Oh, my God.
- Honey. Honey, I need you...

29:18.764 --> 29:19.879
- Oh, my...
- This... This isn't...

29:20.015 --> 29:21.973
You think I can't tell when you're lying?

29:22.101 --> 29:23.560
I am not lying!

29:23.686 --> 29:25.263
Glenn, you can still
do yourself a favour here.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.851
If there's a chance Jamie's still alive,
you can help us get to her.

29:27.982 --> 29:29.773
'Cause otherwise, it's contract murder.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.774
Spend the next few years of your life
looking at a wall,

29:31.902 --> 29:32.982
and then get strapped to a gurney

29:33.112 --> 29:36.896
and have potassium chloride
injected in your arm.

29:37.032 --> 29:39.108
Glenn,

29:39.243 --> 29:41.152
if this is true,

29:41.287 --> 29:42.947
you tell them how to find that girl.

29:43.080 --> 29:46.579
- Gayle, please.
- Tell them right now!

29:46.709 --> 29:48.618
Tell them!

29:51.297 --> 29:52.874
Thing is, I had 10 grand,

29:53.007 --> 29:55.794
and Jess said it wasn't enough for
the risk he was taking.

29:55.926 --> 29:57.041
He had a solution, though.

29:57.178 --> 29:59.799
He'd heard there's people that'd pay
50 grand for a healthy white baby.

29:59.930 --> 30:03.382
Glenn, we got it.
You knocked up an inmate,

30:03.517 --> 30:07.100
you hired someone to murder her
and sell your child.

30:07.229 --> 30:11.441
Now shut the hell up,
or Tim's gonna hit you in the face.

30:48.979 --> 30:53.309
Will you give me those alcohol swabs
and the Betadine packets?

31:17.132 --> 31:18.840
You should have told me
the plan was to kill her.

31:18.968 --> 31:21.459
I figured if I told you, you probably
wouldn't have come along.

31:21.595 --> 31:22.840
I wouldn't have.

31:22.972 --> 31:24.845
See? There you go.

31:26.559 --> 31:29.228
It's just, taking the
baby is one thing, but...

31:29.353 --> 31:31.891
Look at it this way. If you weren't here,

31:32.231 --> 31:35.682
she'd still be dying, and I'd still
be cutting that baby out myself,

31:35.818 --> 31:38.273
probably killing it in the process.

31:38.404 --> 31:40.895
See, that's just like
throwing money in the trash.

31:41.031 --> 31:44.281
See, this way, you get that baby
out in one piece, you get paid.

31:44.827 --> 31:47.781
Don't seem near as wasteful now,
does it?

31:47.913 --> 31:51.578
It's like when the Plains Indians
used to kill all those buffalo.

31:52.501 --> 31:55.917
They made sure they used
every single part of that thing.

31:56.046 --> 31:59.213
It was a sign of respect
for the life they were taking.

32:01.051 --> 32:04.670
Will you grab me that
gauze from over there?

32:06.098 --> 32:08.803
I wanna be ready in case I hit a gusher.

32:08.934 --> 32:10.097
Thataboy.

32:17.484 --> 32:19.144
I ain't seeing the gauze over here.

32:19.278 --> 32:22.065
Look to your left, on the counter.

32:22.948 --> 32:25.190
Telling you, if it's over here,
I don't see... Hey!

33:07.493 --> 33:10.244
US Marshals! Drop your weapon!

33:16.043 --> 33:17.418
It's all clear.

33:31.517 --> 33:33.593
Behind the table, drop your weapon.

33:33.977 --> 33:35.887
- Hey, there, fellas.
- Show me your hands.

33:36.021 --> 33:38.691
Wasn't really expecting to
see you boys again.

33:38.816 --> 33:41.603
- Show me your hands.
- Yeah? Or what? Huh?

33:41.735 --> 33:43.692
I got a gun on her belly,
finger on the trigger.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.647
You shoot me, you're gonna be
spending the rest of the night

33:45.781 --> 33:48.189
cleaning up baby guts
all over that fireplace there.

33:48.325 --> 33:49.356
- Jess?
- Yeah?

33:49.493 --> 33:54.488
Jess, you ever hear of a spot
snipers call the apricot?

33:54.623 --> 33:57.707
It's where the brain
stem meets the spine.

33:57.835 --> 33:59.792
Hit a fella there,

33:59.920 --> 34:03.371
he ain't gonna pull no trigger.
It's just lights out.

34:03.507 --> 34:04.966
And what?
You telling me you're that good?

34:05.467 --> 34:06.961
Me?

34:08.053 --> 34:10.509
Really? This is how this is gonna go...

34:12.391 --> 34:14.679
Show me your hands.
Come on. I got you.

34:15.643 --> 34:18.313
Come on. It's okay. It's okay.

34:54.808 --> 34:57.050
How did that happen?

34:57.186 --> 35:01.978
Honestly, Ava, I don't have any idea.

35:03.984 --> 35:07.318
Go take a seat. Go on.

35:30.219 --> 35:35.426
Okay, take this. Go on.
Clean yourself up.

35:35.557 --> 35:37.217
We'll pretend like this never happened.

35:38.852 --> 35:41.141
It happens again, though,
and I will put you back in

35:41.271 --> 35:43.643
whatever gutter
you just pulled yourself out of.

35:44.525 --> 35:46.102
Yeah.

35:53.826 --> 35:55.818
- Deputy Givens.
- Mrs. Cosgrove.

35:56.036 --> 35:57.661
I was hoping I'd find you.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.785
- Yeah, I can't discuss your husband's case.
- I know.

36:03.377 --> 36:08.252
Glenn's not evil.
Or I guess maybe he is.

36:08.382 --> 36:11.548
You're married to someone for 11
years, you think you know them,

36:11.677 --> 36:13.669
what they're capable of.

36:13.804 --> 36:17.552
We tried for years to start a family.

36:17.683 --> 36:19.971
It turns out that I'm not able.

36:21.061 --> 36:23.054
- So...
- Yeah. Let me...

36:23.188 --> 36:24.682
Let me see if I can find someone
for you to talk to.

36:24.815 --> 36:27.520
No, no, no. I'm just...

36:30.612 --> 36:33.447
- What's the girl's name?
- Again, I can't.

36:33.574 --> 36:36.361
Do you know what
she's planning to do with the baby?

36:36.493 --> 36:39.198
I don't think she has much say in it.

36:39.329 --> 36:41.369
Do you think maybe...

36:41.498 --> 36:44.950
I mean,
I don't know how this works, but

36:45.085 --> 36:48.501
I was kind of hoping that maybe...

36:50.215 --> 36:55.422
I don't know how that
works, either, but

36:55.929 --> 36:58.385
maybe I could find out for you.

37:06.106 --> 37:09.226
Gary.

37:09.359 --> 37:13.060
That's not a real safe way
to approach an armed man.

37:13.196 --> 37:15.106
I guess you're right!

37:17.409 --> 37:20.196
- Something I can do for you?
- No, no, no.

37:20.621 --> 37:23.705
No, I mean, you've already done more
for me than I could ever hope to repay,

37:24.333 --> 37:28.793
which is why I felt like
I needed to tell you face-to-face.

37:28.921 --> 37:30.249
I'm gonna get her back.

37:31.882 --> 37:36.343
Now, I know you think I'm no competition
'cause I can't outshoot you or outfight you

37:36.470 --> 37:38.842
or probably outscrew you.

37:38.972 --> 37:42.341
But if there is one thing I do
know, Raylan, it's selling.

37:42.893 --> 37:45.300
I can get a guy to buy a house
worse than the one he's in,

37:45.437 --> 37:48.308
cost him twice as much,
and have him swear it was his idea.

37:50.359 --> 37:52.647
Yeah, you thought a lot
about this moment, huh?

37:52.778 --> 37:54.984
You said everything you meant to say?

37:55.530 --> 37:57.737
Yeah, pretty much.

37:58.909 --> 38:01.364
She left you for me once, Raylan.

38:26.603 --> 38:28.477
Who were you talking to?

38:29.106 --> 38:30.814
It was nobody.

38:35.862 --> 38:37.654
- What?
- Nothing.

38:38.782 --> 38:40.324
How was your day?

38:40.534 --> 38:41.992
You know. Long.

38:42.703 --> 38:43.817
You wanna tell me about it?

38:44.538 --> 38:46.744
You remember...

38:46.873 --> 38:50.077
You remember I always
liked the name Jess for a boy?

38:50.210 --> 38:52.701
- Yeah, I'm over that.
- I told you.

38:52.838 --> 38:56.123
Easy. I was never a big fan of your list.

38:56.258 --> 38:57.752
What's wrong with my list?

38:57.884 --> 38:59.213
- Cody?
- Yeah.

38:59.344 --> 39:01.467
Well, that's the moment I knew
our marriage was doomed.

39:36.548 --> 39:39.419
You're really not gonna
tell me about your day, are you?

39:40.135 --> 39:42.009
You don't wanna know.

39:42.220 --> 39:44.925
Reason I asked is
'cause I do wanna know.

39:45.766 --> 39:47.675
Okay.

39:47.809 --> 39:51.724
I saw a man threaten to shoot a
pregnant woman through the belly

39:51.855 --> 39:57.276
just before a bullet went through his brain.
So I guess you could say it wasn't good.

39:59.529 --> 40:03.823
I can handle that, Raylan.
I can't handle silence.

40:11.041 --> 40:12.369
All right.

40:14.086 --> 40:17.537
So, who were you talking to outside?

40:19.549 --> 40:21.209
That was your husband.
