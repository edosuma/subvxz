00:01.102 --> 00:02.935
<i> - Until you guys are ready</i>
<i> to grow up</i>

00:02.937 --> 00:04.703
<i> And worry about someone</i>
<i> other than yourselves,</i>

00:04.705 --> 00:05.670
You're both grounded.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.239
<i> - You really need</i>
<i> to think about this.</i>

00:07.241 --> 00:08.073
- I can't be like you.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.575
I can't keep giving up
pieces of who I am

00:09.710 --> 00:10.943
Just because this
is how it's done.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.444
<i> - You slept with someone.</i>

00:12.579 --> 00:15.047
- I know, I know it was wrong,
and I'm wrong.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.348
I'm so sorry, tris.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.849
<i> - I am responsible</i>
<i> for the safety</i>

00:17.918 --> 00:20.252
<i> Of everyone on those planes</i>
<i> and if you are using...</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:22.320
<i> - No, I would never put</i>
<i> my patients at risk.</i>

00:22.390 --> 00:23.789
<i> Or my coworkers.</i>

00:23.791 --> 00:25.256
<i> - You asked me to write you</i>
<i> a prescription</i>

00:25.292 --> 00:26.859
<i> Knowing you were</i>
<i> going to abuse it.</i>

00:26.994 --> 00:29.127
I love you, hayley,
but you used me.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.798
(soft eerie music)

00:37.405 --> 00:38.537
(sighs)

00:41.242 --> 00:43.075
(exhales deeply)

00:46.680 --> 00:48.680
(ominous tone)

00:48.749 --> 00:50.749
(breathing heavily)

00:54.121 --> 00:56.088
- Ms. Roberts, this panel
was put together

00:56.223 --> 00:57.923
To uncover the details

00:58.058 --> 00:59.924
Surrounding a medevac
call you attended

00:59.960 --> 01:01.093
Yesterday evening.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.095
In situations like this,

01:03.097 --> 01:06.364
It's protocol to debrief
everyone involved

01:06.366 --> 01:08.133
When there's been a fatality.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.602
(tense music)

01:14.642 --> 01:17.175
(opening theme)

01:25.352 --> 01:27.586
- Well, uh, the first thing
you should know

01:27.655 --> 01:28.853
Is that we came on at midnight.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.256
As in the night before the call.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.126
You see, hayley and I,
basically, did a 24-hour shift--

01:34.128 --> 01:36.261
- Which isn't standard,
I should add.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.197
But we're always understaffed
in the north.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.998
- Right, right, of course.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.733
- Why don't you start
at the beginning?

01:41.802 --> 01:43.535
- Sure, great.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.803
The beginning.
(chuckles)

01:45.840 --> 01:48.073
You see, we were um...

01:48.208 --> 01:49.774
We were all really shocked.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.445
- That is like the third
load of things

01:53.580 --> 01:56.681
He's lugged out of there.
- Yeah, plus two boxes earlier.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.155
<i> I mean, nobody knew</i>
<i> what happened</i>

02:03.157 --> 02:05.223
<i> To tristan and nowak</i>
<i> when they went to toronto,</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:08.026
But clearly, something happened,
I mean...

02:08.062 --> 02:10.496
Whatever it was must have been
big because they were a great...

02:13.000 --> 02:15.167
Couple, um... Anyway, uh,

02:15.302 --> 02:17.869
I then went to the hangar
to see wheezer...

02:17.872 --> 02:19.905
Chief pilot heaseman.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.308
Because before this,
bodie and I were ground--

02:23.344 --> 02:24.977
- No, no, no.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.212
- You know what? I'm going
to let bodie tell this part.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.914
<i> It was a perfect summer night.</i>

02:28.916 --> 02:30.248
<i> Gosh, I love the north,</i>
<i> you know?</i>

02:30.384 --> 02:33.318
<i> Sun rises before 5 a.M.</i>
<i> Sun sets after 10 p.M.</i>

02:33.453 --> 02:36.922
- You don't need to paint such
a detailed picture, mr. Chopra.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.122
- Got you. Um...

02:38.159 --> 02:40.058
<i> Nowak had been flying</i>

02:40.060 --> 02:41.927
<i> For a couple of hours</i>
<i> before I joined him.</i>

02:41.996 --> 02:44.796
<i> He seemed quiet, but, hey,</i>
<i> that's okay.</i>

02:44.865 --> 02:46.265
<i> There was a lot going on</i>
<i> in the cabin.</i>

02:46.400 --> 02:47.666
- The bump on your collarbone

02:47.668 --> 02:49.000
Probably means it's broken.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.535
You'll need x-rays
and the doctor will probably

02:50.604 --> 02:52.337
Give you a brace for six weeks.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.172
I know, sucks for summer.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.275
- It's not like I was gonna see
summer this year anyway.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.876
- After his appointment at tch,

02:57.945 --> 02:59.544
Otis is headed straight
to thompson youth

02:59.580 --> 03:01.213
Correctional facility.
- Juvie.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.082
- Oh, maybe not the best
vacation plan.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.485
- He's been in trouble a few
times the last couple of years,

03:06.620 --> 03:08.220
But then he decided to steal
a vehicle,

03:08.222 --> 03:10.222
Go joyriding,
and destroy private property.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.157
- I didn't destroy it.
I took it apart.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.760
- And then he fell and broke his
arm running away from security

03:14.895 --> 03:16.327
At the windy lake
tractor dealership.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.130
- Wait, you stole a tractor,
kid?

03:18.132 --> 03:20.165
- No. I didn't drive it
off the lot.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.867
I could've, but I didn't.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.836
- I mean, that just kind of
sounds like a teenage prank, no?

03:24.838 --> 03:27.239
- You know what those combine
harvesters are worth?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.773
More than my house.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.375
- That is impressive,

03:30.510 --> 03:32.043
But what did you think
was gonna happen?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.445
- You know things aren't always
as clear-cut as they seem.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.449
People do the wrong thing
for all kinds of reasons.

03:39.153 --> 03:41.919
- Yeah, uh, listen, um...

03:41.956 --> 03:45.057
Nowak, I know that
we're not particularly...

03:46.227 --> 03:49.194
...Close, but if there's
anything you ever

03:49.329 --> 03:51.997
Want to talk about,
I'm here, you know?

03:51.999 --> 03:56.534
Maybe you want to talk about
yourself or... Tristan.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.504
Maybe.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.406
Okay.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.675
- Saw a lot of kids like that
at cadets.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.479
Parents enrolled them hoping
it would straighten them out.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.715
Worked for me.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.116
<i> (chopper): We then</i>
<i> dropped off otis</i>

04:12.152 --> 04:13.819
<i> And his social worker</i>
<i> in thompson.</i>

04:13.821 --> 04:15.687
<i> Hayley took them</i>
<i> to the hospital.</i>

04:15.822 --> 04:17.422
<i> A couple of hours later,</i>
<i> we got a call</i>

04:17.424 --> 04:20.158
<i>About a possible cardiac patiet</i>
<i> at prospect river.</i>

04:20.194 --> 04:22.828
<i> Nowak went with hayley,</i>
<i> but it's sop for a pilot</i>

04:22.830 --> 04:24.963
<i> To stay back with the aircraft</i>
<i> for safety reasons.</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:26.298
<i> We use that time</i>
<i> to do paperwork,</i>

04:26.433 --> 04:27.832
<i> Get ahead of aircraft prep</i>

04:27.868 --> 04:29.967
<i> As there is always</i>
<i> something to do.</i>

04:30.004 --> 04:32.037
(chopper chuckles)

04:33.474 --> 04:35.206
(clattering)

04:37.177 --> 04:38.343
Damn it.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.578
(clattering)

04:39.713 --> 04:41.446
Better not be a snake.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.782
(tense music)

04:53.927 --> 04:55.127
(screams)

04:55.262 --> 04:56.427
- Don't shoot!

04:57.864 --> 04:58.997
- What the hell, kid?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.999
- I thought you were flying back
to windy lake.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.302
I needed a ride home
from thompson.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.737
- But you were supposed
to be in juvie.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.406
- I was supposed to do
a lot of things.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.207
Get an x-ray, see the doctor.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.742
- So what?
You just came back

05:10.877 --> 05:14.212
To the airport to just...
Hitch a ride?

05:16.216 --> 05:20.819
Dude, it is illegal
to stow away in an airplane.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.354
- Why?
- Because it's dangerous!

05:23.390 --> 05:25.824
You could've gotten hurt,
you could've gotten us hurt too.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.360
- You're not going to leave me
out here, are you?

05:29.663 --> 05:32.096
- No, we're going to take you
back to thompson.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.698
But when hayley gets back
with the sat phone,

05:33.701 --> 05:35.233
We're calling
your social worker.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.434
Move!

05:39.506 --> 05:40.772
You know, kid,

05:40.774 --> 05:42.507
You're already
in a lot of trouble.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.376
This is not helping your cause.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.480
Do me a favour, stay in here.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.216
(ominous tone)

05:59.593 --> 06:00.992
- How much oil
does this thing take?

06:00.994 --> 06:04.262
- What the fuzz?
Kid, I told you to stay inside.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.398
- The engine looks
like it's backwards.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.399
And that exhaust
is at the front.

06:08.435 --> 06:09.668
Is that a reverse-flow turbine?

06:09.803 --> 06:12.871
- I mean, it's also called
a free-turbine.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.207
Yeah, I mean,
it's more fuel-efficient.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.808
Canadian design.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.075
Two-- how do you know this?

06:18.679 --> 06:19.878
- I like machines.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.613
- Careful with your arm.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.282
(gasps)
- cool.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.683
- Yeah.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.984
- Can I top up the oil?

06:28.422 --> 06:30.088
- Yeah, here you go.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.323
Uh, easy does it.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.527
Oh, okay, that's...
That's great. Thank you.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.896
And that's the cap.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.566
We can screw that back on. Ex--

06:41.701 --> 06:42.701
(sighs)

06:43.837 --> 06:45.904
- We can't fly without
the cap on, can we?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.605
- Nope.
- Because the oil

06:47.674 --> 06:49.474
Will leak under pressure.
- Yup.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.376
- So we're stuck here?
And it's all my fault.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.044
Now, I can get
in trouble for this too.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.713
- Whoa, whoa, careful, kid.
- I mess everything up.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.314
And I'm not even trying
to make trouble.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.682
(sighs)

06:57.684 --> 06:59.117
I didn't steal a combine,

06:59.119 --> 07:00.518
And I wasn't joyriding.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.186
I just wanted to understand
how it worked.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.655
I was gonna put it
back together.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.390
I was gonna leave it
just like I found it.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.058
But then those stupid
security guards showed up

07:07.060 --> 07:08.660
And they thought I was trying
to break it,

07:08.729 --> 07:10.661
And I couldn't explain.
No one ever understands me

07:10.697 --> 07:12.363
When I try to explain.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.865
- Kid, I...

07:22.542 --> 07:25.410
- I'm not hiding,
I just needed a minute.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.882
- You know, the great thing
about machines

07:30.918 --> 07:32.817
Is that with the right tool,

07:32.820 --> 07:34.286
You can fix almost anything.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.454
- How'd you get it out?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.157
- Took the cowling off.
Went for a treasure hunt.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.493
You want to help me
put this cap back on?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.127
See what the guts
of the engine look like?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.596
(chuckles)

07:44.731 --> 07:47.098
- Want a juice box?
- Where did you get all those?

07:47.234 --> 07:49.301
- Grabbed them
from the hospital.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.236
- Is this fruit punch?
- They're my favourite.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.505
- Dude, mine too.
(laughing)

07:53.574 --> 07:55.040
Here, c'mon, let's go.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.509
Alright, don't blink.

07:57.644 --> 08:01.513
Here it comes.
Four, three, two...

08:02.583 --> 08:03.715
- Oh, wow.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.650
Awesome!
- Here, check this out.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.184
You see the little dipper?

08:07.221 --> 08:12.356
The north star is at the end
of its handle.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.659
And then from there, you can see

08:14.695 --> 08:16.928
The four pillar stars
of the pegasus constellation.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.063
Just over to the left.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.465
It's my personal favourite.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.335
- How come?

08:23.337 --> 08:25.403
- It was the first planet found

08:25.405 --> 08:28.073
Orbiting a star
outside our solar system.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.875
Now, that star,
technically, is a sun.

08:30.944 --> 08:34.078
- Because a sun's only a sun
when planets revolve around it.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.279
- Yeah.

08:35.315 --> 08:38.216
But also, it kind of
gives me hope.

08:39.253 --> 08:40.818
Like, maybe we, uh...

08:41.955 --> 08:44.556
Really aren't as alone
as we feel sometimes.

08:46.894 --> 08:50.027
Maybe you just haven't found
the other planets

08:50.063 --> 08:52.230
That are like you out there yet.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.001
- Are you going to call the cops
when we get to thompson?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.469
- Where are your parents, otis?

08:57.604 --> 08:59.537
What do they think
about all this?

09:00.807 --> 09:03.040
- They died a couple
of years ago.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.776
Car accident.
- I'm sorry.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.111
- My older sister
takes care of me.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.914
She doesn't want me
to be taken away, but...

09:09.983 --> 09:11.582
I know I'm not like other kids.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.352
I'm hard to deal with.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.857
- I got into trouble
for joyriding too.

09:19.926 --> 09:23.394
But I actually was joyriding

09:23.463 --> 09:24.862
Because...

09:24.898 --> 09:26.731
(sighs)
I don't know, I think I just

09:26.866 --> 09:28.533
Did it because I was bored.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.602
(emotional music)

09:30.737 --> 09:32.137
I think I just needed a...

09:32.139 --> 09:34.339
(vehicle approaching)

09:34.341 --> 09:35.473
...Challenge.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.811
(hayley sighs)
- false alarm.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.414
The patient just had
indigestion.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.551
- We do have a patient
for thompson.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.219
Uh...

09:48.288 --> 09:50.755
Do you think we can pencil
a relief pilot, cap?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.691
- Think we can make
an exception.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.261
- Left, bank left.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.166
Right, bank right.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.835
Forward is down

10:04.871 --> 10:07.304
And back is up.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.740
(chuckling)

10:10.644 --> 10:12.777
Gentle movements,
nothing sudden.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.920
- No way! No effing way!

10:22.055 --> 10:24.121
- This is all you, kid,
this is all you.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.625
You got this. You got this.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.526
(chuckles)

10:28.528 --> 10:29.994
Gentle, gentle. Yeah.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.263
Hey, is there a cadet squadron
in thompson?

10:32.399 --> 10:33.465
- Not yet.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.802
- Gentle. There we go.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.071
- Mr. Chopra, why are you
telling us all this?

10:40.107 --> 10:44.141
- I thought you told me to start
from the beginning.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.944
- The beginning of the call
with the fatality.

10:47.014 --> 10:50.215
- Right. You see, nowak
was dutied out

10:50.217 --> 10:52.083
After prospect river,
so bodie came on.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.886
That's who I was with.
For the rest of my shift.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.288
- Right, we have some
questions about that.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.024
- We heard you're
leaving skymed.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.961
(clears throat)
- that hasn't been decided yet.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.438
For me, it all started
the day before.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.707
He's 30 minutes late,
where is he?

11:15.842 --> 11:18.910
- Kinglsey said he'll co-sign
the loan for the plane,

11:18.912 --> 11:20.511
He'll be here!
- If we don't get that loan,

11:20.580 --> 11:21.913
We can't make a move
on the plane,

11:21.915 --> 11:23.447
And the seller needs
an answer tonight.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.317
Is this crazy?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.186
Me starting a cargo business.
This is crazy, right?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.987
I'm a pilot.
A grounded pilot.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.490
- Hey... Spiral mcgee.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.192
The loan manager
will see the potential

11:35.228 --> 11:37.862
In the growth planning model
in the business plan.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.731
- I could not have
done this without you.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.400
- I know. It was fun.

11:42.535 --> 11:46.070
I'm learning a lot in my
accounting apprenticeship.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.006
- I'm sorry you had to drop out
of phlebotomy for accounting,

11:48.141 --> 11:50.208
And uh...

11:50.343 --> 11:51.943
I'm sorry I couldn't help you
get out of thompson.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.015
- You know, it's funny.
I used to think I wanted

11:57.150 --> 12:00.417
To get away as far away from
this place as possible.

12:00.454 --> 12:01.952
But now I think
what I really wanted

12:01.988 --> 12:03.755
Was just something
that excited me.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.390
(phone ringing)

12:05.525 --> 12:07.358
Is it kinglsey?
- It's crystal.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.559
(phone beeps)

12:08.628 --> 12:09.860
Hello?

12:13.967 --> 12:16.835
- The housekeeper at his hotel
found him this morning.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.370
Went into renal failure
and collapsed.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.306
I called as soon as I saw
his name on the chart.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.341
- I knew that he was sick,
but...

12:23.343 --> 12:25.310
He just came into my life.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.045
I thought that we had more time.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.948
- Have you considered donating?

12:31.684 --> 12:33.284
(sighs)

12:34.521 --> 12:36.588
<i>(dr. Paul): We're sorry to hear</i>
<i> about your father.</i>

12:36.723 --> 12:38.389
<i> And because of the shortages,</i>

12:38.425 --> 12:40.224
<i> You were back to work</i>
<i> soon after?</i>

12:41.061 --> 12:42.460
- Northern health in thunder bay

12:42.529 --> 12:43.861
Is looking for
a new medevac carrier.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.630
They're struggling to find
a company in ontario

12:45.765 --> 12:47.799
That can handle the volume
that they need.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.401
So I'm getting pressure
from our ops manager

12:50.537 --> 12:52.537
To make sure that we keep
all our planes in the air

12:52.539 --> 12:53.938
To prove to them
that we can

12:54.073 --> 12:55.206
So that we can land
this contract.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.141
Which means I need
all my pilots flying.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.077
Even the chuckleheads
who made idiot mistakes

12:59.079 --> 13:01.078
That I'm still mad about.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.747
So...

13:02.749 --> 13:04.282
You see my conundrum.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.451
- We shouldn't have put you
in this position, sir.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.286
- Captain bodie's right, sir.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.688
We know better
and we'll do better.

13:10.757 --> 13:14.492
- No. More. Dumb. Shit.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.628
You're on 9-2-2 with nowak.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.430
And he's in a mood,
so don't be late.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.265
Call just came in
from windy lake.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.372
- Thank you. Seriously.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.010
(emotional music)

13:36.183 --> 13:38.115
- You okay?
Heard about kingsley.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.250
I'm sorry.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.785
- I used to think
that I needed to be

13:40.920 --> 13:42.987
A pilot because it's who I am.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.924
Now I can't lose flying
because...

13:46.960 --> 13:49.193
It's the only thing
I know how to do.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.664
- You know that some people
are born with only one kidney?

13:53.700 --> 13:55.199
I didn't know it either.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.736
But I flew with this guy,
been healthy all of his life.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.939
One day, he fell test-driving
these broken rollerblades.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.676
Took him to the hospital,
gave him an x-ray,

14:04.811 --> 14:06.477
We found out
he was one of those people.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.945
Would have gone his whole life
never knowing.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.280
Except for those rollerblades.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.948
- And what happened to him?
Lose his licence?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.284
- No, he flies for westjet.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.353
Still owes me 50 bucks
for those rollerblades.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.825
- We understand you joined
ms. Roberts on shift

14:20.894 --> 14:22.894
On skymed 911
later that evening.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.329
<i> How did she seem</i>
<i> when you arrived?</i>

14:24.464 --> 14:26.697
<i>We heard that she'd been workig</i>
<i> for almost 24 hours.</i>

14:27.400 --> 14:28.700
<i> (bodie): Um...</i>

14:29.936 --> 14:31.168
Uh, she seemed just as fit
for duty as any of us.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.737
- And how did you
ascertain that?

14:32.739 --> 14:33.872
Did you speak to ms. Roberts

14:34.007 --> 14:35.606
Before you received
the call to the scene?

14:35.642 --> 14:37.508
- I was going to, but...

14:37.577 --> 14:39.076
- Psst! Bodie!

14:40.313 --> 14:41.512
Come here, quick.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.847
- I'm confused.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.648
This was the day
of the fatality?

14:45.752 --> 14:47.218
And you saw ms. Highway
at the airport too.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.988
We don't have any record
of her working yesterday.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.856
- There aren't enough nurses
in the north

14:51.991 --> 14:54.259
So I wasn't working
yesterday, no.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.795
But between skymed and school,
I'm always working.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.129
(jeremy imitating sirens)

14:59.165 --> 15:00.631
- And you're really
rocking and rolling,

15:00.667 --> 15:02.233
You got the sirens going on.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.668
Someone's in the backseat
having a heart attack,

15:03.803 --> 15:05.270
You're like "slow down!"
and you're like,

15:05.405 --> 15:06.838
"wait, I'm gonna
get you somewhere safe!

15:06.840 --> 15:08.238
Hold on!"
you hit a jump. Vroom!

15:08.275 --> 15:09.707
Get some air. Whoa!

15:09.842 --> 15:12.476
- Yeah... But you'll never get
as much air as a pilot.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.211
Uh, remember, kids,
an ambulance might go

15:14.281 --> 15:18.582
140 kilometres an hour,
but an airplane will go 430.

15:18.652 --> 15:19.484
Just saying.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.352
- Right, but, but our heroes

15:21.421 --> 15:23.354
Put safety first.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.491
And paramedics,
like mr. Jeremy, save lives.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.963
- Does anyone know how fast
the blood in your veins moves?

15:32.999 --> 15:35.432
It travels
three feet per second.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.501
That means the blood
that's in your heart right now

15:37.537 --> 15:39.303
Can go all the way
to churchill in two days.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.039
- My blood's going somewhere?

15:43.276 --> 15:46.110
- I don't like blood.
Seeing it makes my tummy hurt.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.446
(wheezer whispers): Me too.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.114
- Okay.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.649
Who wants to listen
to their heart?

15:51.718 --> 15:53.684
Volunteers get a sucker.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.186
- Ooh, bribery, nice.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.921
(children chattering)

15:56.990 --> 15:58.256
- You take these ones here.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.890
(phone ringing)
- I'll be right back.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.725
(crystal): There you go.
- Hey.

16:01.761 --> 16:02.961
- Hello?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.096
(ominous music)

16:05.165 --> 16:06.764
I'll go get my flight bag.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.399
- You made a house call?

16:09.402 --> 16:10.801
Was that with skymed?

16:10.837 --> 16:11.735
There's no record of you

16:11.771 --> 16:12.804
Taking a house call yesterday.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.339
- The patient has requested
I respect

16:14.474 --> 16:16.140
Their legal right
to confidentiality.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.176
(knocking)

16:23.082 --> 16:24.581
- Thanks for coming.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.889
An er doctor should know
better than to have

16:31.891 --> 16:32.957
A glass table in the house.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.360
Tripped and fell
into the stupid thing.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.564
- Well, looks like the worst of
the lacerations are on your arm.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.035
Surprised you called.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.369
After the other day,

16:45.372 --> 16:47.805
I wasn't sure I'd be
your first choice.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.707
- These aren't that deep.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.275
The glue should
keep them closed.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.112
- Going somewhere?
- Pass me the ultrasound.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.985
- What do you need it for?

17:01.120 --> 17:02.920
Are you hurt somewhere else?

17:05.825 --> 17:08.192
Doctor noah, you called me
on my day off

17:08.261 --> 17:10.394
And you asked me
to sneak a portable ultrasound

17:10.397 --> 17:12.196
From the hospital.
What is going on?

17:12.232 --> 17:14.899
- I've had ulcers in the past.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.667
Under a bit of pressure,

17:16.736 --> 17:19.203
So when I started having
some epigastric pain

17:19.338 --> 17:21.038
The last couple
of days...

17:21.074 --> 17:22.807
- But you can't even see
an ulcer on an ultrasound.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.508
Not unless it's perforated.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.944
Is that why you fell?

17:26.980 --> 17:29.680
- It was a sharp pain.
It took me off-guard.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.482
And it hasn't perforated.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.485
- A perforated ulcer
is not just a sharp pain.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.153
It is excruciating.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.555
Dr. Noah, if you were
in that much pain,

17:38.591 --> 17:40.691
You need to go to an er
and you need an endoscope.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.028
- You want me to go to my place
of work and be examined by who?

17:44.163 --> 17:46.297
My colleagues?
Worse, my students?

17:46.299 --> 17:48.032
- I'm your student.
- You're different.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.701
- An untreated ulcer
is dangerous.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.771
If it perforates and we don't
get you to an or in time,

17:54.808 --> 17:56.374
Then--
- you think I don't know that?

17:56.376 --> 17:59.043
You know how hard I've worked
to be taken seriously

17:59.178 --> 18:01.712
By my colleagues
and my students?

18:01.781 --> 18:03.547
I'll be damned
if I throw that all away

18:03.616 --> 18:05.649
So that they can take turns

18:05.718 --> 18:08.453
Practicing doing
an abdominal exam on me

18:08.588 --> 18:10.087
In a paper gown.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.927
- What if I can get you
to the hospital

18:16.062 --> 18:17.195
Without anyone knowing?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.099
- Where's the party at?
(chuckles)

18:22.234 --> 18:23.534
- Keep it down.
- What?

18:23.536 --> 18:24.801
What's the emergency?

18:24.838 --> 18:26.204
Couldn't get a hold
of hayley or something?

18:26.339 --> 18:27.671
- Hayley doesn't have
an ambulance

18:27.707 --> 18:29.373
And we aren't talking right now.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.943
I need to sneak dr. Noah
to a hospital,

18:32.078 --> 18:34.478
She's sick and she doesn't
want anyone to see her.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.880
- Wait, hold on, hold on.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.682
You called me because
your boss is being stubborn?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.617
Like, I know you don't take me
seriously, crys, but...

18:39.752 --> 18:41.219
I'm graduating soon. Okay?
They could kick me out

18:41.354 --> 18:42.486
For this kind of shit.
C'mon, like...

18:42.555 --> 18:44.354
- Do you know how many times
I put my ass

18:44.390 --> 18:45.756
On the line for you?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.225
How many times I could've been
fired or worse...

18:48.294 --> 18:49.894
(sighs)

18:49.963 --> 18:51.228
- Lead the way, yeah.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.163
- Yeah.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.430
We'll take the ambulance

18:53.500 --> 18:54.665
To the morgue entrance

18:54.701 --> 18:56.300
And no one will see us
go in that way.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.969
- I'm sure you know
proper placement, dr. Yana,

18:58.104 --> 18:59.403
If you wouldn't mind.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.005
- Uh... She doesn't need that.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.573
We just need a ride
to the hospital.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.241
- She goes in my ambulance,
she follows my rules.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.710
Okay? I just thought
you might be more comfortable

19:05.712 --> 19:06.844
If you did it.
(sighs)

19:06.979 --> 19:08.913
Yeah? Thanks.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.514
So you've had epigastric pain
for a few days,

19:10.517 --> 19:12.316
Any shortness of breath
or anything?

19:12.451 --> 19:14.852
- Just from the pain.
From the ulcer.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.522
Can't believe I'm even
considering this.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.257
Even if you can get me
to the hospital

19:20.293 --> 19:22.059
Without anyone knowing,

19:22.061 --> 19:23.628
Who's going to do the endoscope?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.229
- Well, you taught me how
to do a t.E.E.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.931
And that's basically
an endoscope, right?

19:27.066 --> 19:29.032
You just go farther
into the stomach?

19:30.570 --> 19:32.203
- Record it so I can
look at it later.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.337
(machine beeping)
- ooh, ooh,

19:33.472 --> 19:34.939
Whoa, are you two serious?

19:34.941 --> 19:36.807
You don't have an ulcer,
she's having a heart attack.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.776
(dr. Yana and crystal): What?!
- Look, you didn't check?

19:38.778 --> 19:41.278
47-year-old woman,
high-stress job, abdominal pain.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.280
I mean, women are more likely
to present with deferred pain.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.215
And statistically,
black women are more likely

19:45.251 --> 19:46.550
To have a heart attack.
I mean, c'mon,

19:46.619 --> 19:47.818
You guys know this, right?

19:47.887 --> 19:50.721
- Uh... Get the nitroglycerin.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.226
Let's get you over to the couch.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.394
(spraying)

19:56.529 --> 19:58.429
(groans)
how did I miss this?

19:58.498 --> 20:00.364
- Rookie mistake.
You let the patient tell you

20:00.499 --> 20:02.966
What's wrong with them instead
of checking for yourself.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.702
Okay, now we wait to see
if the pain goes away

20:05.738 --> 20:07.838
Or if we gotta
take her to the er

20:10.443 --> 20:11.709
I'll get the stretcher.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.245
- So...

20:15.281 --> 20:17.448
What's the deal
with mr. Hunkamedic?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.251
- He's graduating as a pcp soon,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.119
But don't worry, I trust him.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.388
(chuckles)
- I've seen you at the hospital,

20:24.424 --> 20:25.923
There's always tension.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.459
Is your future or ex mistake?

20:29.963 --> 20:31.729
- Ex.
- Mmm...

20:31.798 --> 20:34.197
- Uh, I screwed it up.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.099
- That's medicine for you.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.169
You heal the masses,
ruin your marriage.

20:40.806 --> 20:43.940
- Your... Wife wasn't home
when you fell.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.945
The suitcases.
Did something happen?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.413
(door opens)

20:49.415 --> 20:51.515
- Alright, we can hit you
twice more with nitro,

20:51.584 --> 20:54.384
But after that...

20:54.420 --> 20:56.821
- Yana, we need to get you
to the cath lab

20:56.823 --> 20:58.622
In winnipeg for an angiogram.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.892
- I need a referral from an er
and I'm not going to tch.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.727
- You'd rather have a stemi
than be embarrassed?

21:03.796 --> 21:05.363
Listen, I've seen people
in the er with way more

21:05.498 --> 21:07.498
Embarrassing stories
than a heart attack, I mean...

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
- Dr. Sung had a cardiologist
friend in winnipeg.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.969
He's helped me out once before,
I still have his number.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.771
If he'd accept you
at the cath lab...

21:13.840 --> 21:15.773
- If... You can get me
to winnipeg

21:15.842 --> 21:17.441
Without anyone knowing.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.177
(mysterious music)

21:20.179 --> 21:22.145
- Psst. Bodie.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.914
Come here, quick.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.983
We have to take a cardiac
patient to winnipeg.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.885
(indistinct whispering)

21:29.121 --> 21:31.055
- Isn't that...
- Yeah, we have to keep

21:31.057 --> 21:32.923
This fast and quiet, okay?

21:33.059 --> 21:35.525
I'll explain everything
when we're in the air.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.397
- Hey, do you guys got this?
I gotta go shadow hayley.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.464
Or, actually, I'll stay,
I'll stay.

21:40.599 --> 21:43.000
- No, we've got it.
Go, and thank you.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.835
For everything.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.403
- Okay.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.338
What's up, man?

21:48.374 --> 21:49.740
(beeping)

21:50.543 --> 21:53.010
- Crap, I got a call. Sorry.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.915
Hey, you two got time
for a quick trip to winnipeg?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.487
- Dr. Sung's friend
is expecting us

22:03.523 --> 22:05.822
And he'll get you right in
for an angiogram.

22:05.858 --> 22:06.891
- Okay.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.794
How's your grandmother?

22:12.365 --> 22:14.164
- Good.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.032
Chemo's rough, but...

22:16.069 --> 22:18.702
She's happy to be
with her community.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.571
Practicing her medicine too.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.441
- You were right about
not wanting to be like me.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.777
- That's not what I meant.

22:26.779 --> 22:30.147
- No, I did give up too much.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.817
My wife left me last night.

22:37.290 --> 22:40.724
That's why the suitcases
were out.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.659
She's probably already
in winnipeg

22:42.695 --> 22:44.995
Waiting for her connecting
flight to jamaica.

22:46.265 --> 22:48.265
She said she couldn't stand
around another second

22:48.401 --> 22:50.801
Watching me die a slow death
on the job.

22:53.072 --> 22:56.807
Jahnaya and I, we moved here
when I got into med school.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.742
And I...

22:58.745 --> 23:00.678
Learned pretty fast

23:00.813 --> 23:03.280
The people here just don't
trust a doctor

23:03.316 --> 23:04.815
With an accent.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.752
Can't advance

23:08.788 --> 23:12.155
Unless you speak like them,
act like them.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.957
Dress like them.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.962
So that's what I did.
I dropped my accent,

23:18.998 --> 23:21.098
I changed the way I dressed.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.500
Changed how I spoke.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.503
(scoffs)

23:25.505 --> 23:28.839
It's pretty hard to hold on
to yourself when...

23:32.011 --> 23:35.045
When you change so much
on the outside.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.580
And eventually,

23:37.850 --> 23:39.883
The inside changes too.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.455
Don't be like me, crystal.

23:50.696 --> 23:52.896
(tense music)

23:55.001 --> 23:57.968
- You see? Somebody else had
to talk some sense into you.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.603
- Jahnaya?

23:59.672 --> 24:02.806
- I called her.
Her number was in your cell.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.141
Just really seemed like
you two needed to talk.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.811
- I am so sorry, jahnaya.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.814
I let this job take over
real parts of me.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.483
The best parts.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.752
I let it ruin my mind and body

24:14.754 --> 24:17.288
Until there was nothing
left of me.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.623
And there was nothing left
to give you.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.226
I know this
is 20 years too late,

24:22.361 --> 24:24.361
But I'm just glad
that I got to say this.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.929
- You're not gone.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.465
Okay, you just got lost.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.702
If you're lost,
you can be found.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.637
I love you, you silly woman.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.039
- I love you too, jahnaya.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.313
(sniffling)

24:42.315 --> 24:45.916
- Ms. Highway,
you keep saying, "the patient."

24:45.918 --> 24:47.051
Who was this patient?

24:47.186 --> 24:49.853
We have no record
of any patient.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.022
- None of this is relevant.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.524
And it's redundant
that we're even

24:53.593 --> 24:55.058
Interviewing ms. Highway.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.994
She didn't attend
the fatality call.

24:57.129 --> 25:00.530
- But she was with jeremy wood,
who left to shadow ms. Roberts.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.065
He was at the scene of the call.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.602
Now jeremy isn't
a licenced paramedic yet.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.203
But you called him
to assist you.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.071
We have some questions about
his skill level,

25:08.107 --> 25:09.740
About whether
he has the training

25:09.809 --> 25:11.675
To attend a scene
like this with ms. Roberts.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.011
- No, jeremy
is a good paramedic.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.679
I would trust him with my life.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.948
- We understand that you have
a history with mr. Wood

25:17.950 --> 25:20.284
That might make you feel
the need to protect him.

25:20.286 --> 25:23.620
But no one would blame mr. Wood
if he wasn't up for this.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.956
Even a highly experienced
first responder--

25:25.992 --> 25:28.158
- Jeremey knows what he's doing.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.161
And you know that.

25:32.631 --> 25:33.830
- Dr. Noah?

25:34.833 --> 25:37.434
- Mr. Wood is a very
good paramedic.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.572
Ms. Highway
isn't protecting him.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.710
She's protecting me.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.113
I was the patient. I was flown
to cardiology in winnipeg

25:50.149 --> 25:51.982
And I received a stent.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.885
Luckily, we got to the hospital
quickly enough.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.853
And...

25:56.923 --> 25:59.723
That's all I needed.
If you'll excuse me.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.458
(chair scraping)

26:05.331 --> 26:07.865
(tense music)

26:09.335 --> 26:12.202
- The fatality was not
jeremy's fault.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.805
- It's my fault.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.310
I'm the reason
the patient is dead.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.687
(leah): I reviewed
the deposition

26:29.822 --> 26:32.155
And we'll file on Monday
when I'm back from the cottage.

26:32.191 --> 26:35.092
My assistant will follow up.
Thanks, marsha.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.094
<i> - Thanks, have a good weekend.</i>

26:37.096 --> 26:38.962
(call beeps off)

26:38.998 --> 26:41.165
Dad and nate are building
a fire tonight.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.036
C'mon, sadie.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.705
We stayed for your soccer game

26:47.840 --> 26:49.639
And now it's family
weekend time.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.441
- I don't want
family weekend time.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.977
I don't want to be with you.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.511
I want to be with my friends.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.047
I'm missing the first
sleepover of the season.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.449
Whole team's going
except for me.

26:59.485 --> 27:01.518
- This weekend has been
planned for months.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.821
And you'll have, like,
four more sleepovers

27:03.956 --> 27:05.522
With your team this summer.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.461
I know what'll cheer you up.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.197
(radio plays music)
we're on a private road,

27:13.332 --> 27:14.698
Want to take center stage?

27:14.734 --> 27:17.100
♪ I just came to say hello ♪

27:20.406 --> 27:21.471
♪ hello ♪

27:21.507 --> 27:22.539
Woo!

27:23.776 --> 27:24.841
♪ hello ♪

27:27.847 --> 27:29.546
♪ hello, oh, oh, oh ♪♪

27:29.548 --> 27:31.481
Sweetie, you gotta get down.
I can't really see.

27:31.517 --> 27:32.916
Honey!
(tires screeching)

27:32.985 --> 27:34.084
(crashing)

27:34.153 --> 27:35.486
- Damn it.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.554
- Hey, thought we agreed
you were going to take leave.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.490
(hayley sighs)
- I am.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.291
And I, uh, thought we agreed

27:41.360 --> 27:44.161
That you were going to let
me talk to crystal so...

27:44.230 --> 27:45.862
Guess we're both disappointed.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.700
- Are you okay?

27:49.702 --> 27:52.602
- What do you mean okay?
I gave you all my pills so...

27:53.305 --> 27:55.172
- No, um...
(scoffs)

27:56.242 --> 27:58.175
What's your plan?
Did you pick a program?

27:58.878 --> 28:01.378
- No, I don't need one

28:01.513 --> 28:03.247
Because I stopped
taking the pills--

28:03.249 --> 28:04.381
- Hayley, hayley, hayley.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.850
Just because you're not
taking anything,

28:06.886 --> 28:08.919
Doesn't mean you're okay.
You can't just white-knuckle it

28:09.054 --> 28:11.255
Through withdrawal
and think that it's over.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.056
Hey, it's not going to be over
until you deal with

28:13.092 --> 28:14.390
Some of the stuff
that's underneath that.

28:14.427 --> 28:15.859
- Whoa,

28:15.895 --> 28:18.996
Wow, when did you
become a therapist?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.331
That's amazing, I had no idea.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.935
- All I'm saying...

28:24.937 --> 28:27.003
Is you cannot do this
without support. No one can.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.905
- You have no right,

28:28.907 --> 28:31.441
You've no right to rat me out
to my best friend.

28:31.444 --> 28:33.677
You have no right to tell me
what to do. You're not my boss.

28:33.746 --> 28:36.080
Better yet, you're not...
You're not even my boyfriend!

28:37.116 --> 28:38.548
- Hey, hayley,
I know we said 4:00.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.751
Look at that, 3:57.
(sighs)

28:43.556 --> 28:45.555
I can give you guys three more
minutes. I'll come back.

28:45.624 --> 28:46.957
- No, actually,
it's perfect timing.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.192
I just got a page,
wheels up in 15.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.560
Let's go.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.932
(tense music)

28:57.236 --> 29:00.504
- Leah brooks, 45. Her car's
onboard safety called it in.

29:00.639 --> 29:01.772
Ambulance van's on its way.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.507
Transport the patient
back to the plane.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.175
- There's so much blood.
- Yeah, moose bleed.

29:10.316 --> 29:13.283
- Please... Please...
- Hr's high, start an iv.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.319
- Okay.
- Sweetie? Where's my daughter?

29:15.454 --> 29:16.920
- Was she in the car with you?

29:16.922 --> 29:19.523
- The roof,
she's in the sunroof.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.258
- She must have been thrown.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.726
We got another patient
somewhere, a little girl.

29:22.795 --> 29:23.694
Her name's sadie.

29:23.829 --> 29:25.028
Sadie!
- Sadie!

29:25.164 --> 29:26.730
- Sadie!

29:26.865 --> 29:28.999
- I'm going to lean you back,
alright?

29:29.001 --> 29:30.467
Nice and slow.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.135
(men yelling): Sadie!
Make some noise!

29:32.138 --> 29:33.169
- Sadie!

29:33.873 --> 29:35.272
Can you hear us?!

29:35.274 --> 29:37.541
- Please, you have
to find my baby.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.509
- They're looking, okay?
They'll find her.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.080
You hit your head, but can you
tell me where it hurts?

29:44.116 --> 29:46.216
There's a lot of blood,
I can't tell which is yours.

29:46.351 --> 29:48.952
- Sadie!
- Sadie!

29:48.988 --> 29:50.420
Where are you?

29:50.489 --> 29:52.489
- Hey, grab the backboard.
- Coming.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.624
- This is all my fault,
I put her in danger.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.960
- Sadie!
- Sadie!

29:57.029 --> 29:58.494
- Sadie!

29:58.531 --> 29:59.896
(sobbing)

30:01.367 --> 30:02.833
Baby!

30:02.835 --> 30:03.800
- Sadie!

30:03.869 --> 30:06.503
- Okay, here, help me, uh...

30:06.505 --> 30:07.770
- Help me get her out.
- Okay.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.374
(hayley grunts)
alright,

30:10.509 --> 30:11.908
Watch her neck, alright?

30:11.944 --> 30:13.176
Ready?

30:13.179 --> 30:15.979
One, two...

30:17.650 --> 30:18.615
- Over here!

30:18.684 --> 30:19.816
- Hey. Sadie, sadie, sadie.

30:19.951 --> 30:21.351
She's over here, I found her.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.655
- She okay?
I have to go to her.

30:24.790 --> 30:27.423
- No, stay here.
I'll go check on her, okay?

30:29.261 --> 30:30.760
- She's a little hot.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.497
Just... Stay awake,
stay awake, stay awake.

30:35.734 --> 30:36.867
What is that?

30:37.937 --> 30:39.402
- It hurts!

30:39.438 --> 30:40.904
- What do you got?
- Vitals are good.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.538
(leah): Sadie!

30:42.575 --> 30:44.674
- Hang on, leah.
- Is she okay?

30:44.710 --> 30:46.743
(sadie): It really hurts.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.047
- What is it, what's wrong?
- She's okay!

30:50.049 --> 30:51.215
She's got a broken femur.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.749
- Okay.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.885
(sobbing)

30:55.020 --> 30:56.052
Okay.

30:56.555 --> 30:57.520
(screaming)

30:57.590 --> 31:00.857
(crying)

31:00.893 --> 31:02.359
- Hang on, sadie.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.228
No pedal pulse.
She needs a traction splint.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.830
Can you handle that?
- It's a two-person job.

31:06.832 --> 31:08.231
- I start the fentanyl.
Then you and bird

31:08.234 --> 31:09.833
Can deal with the splint.
Keep an eye on mom

31:09.902 --> 31:11.167
While I get this going.
Hey, bodie!

31:11.203 --> 31:13.836
Call dispatch! We have
two critical patients.

31:13.873 --> 31:16.306
We need another medevac!
(sadie crying)

31:16.342 --> 31:18.075
I know it hurts, sweetie.
But this will help, okay?

31:18.210 --> 31:19.476
Once we get your leg
in a splint,

31:19.545 --> 31:21.377
It'll feel a lot better,
alright?

31:22.248 --> 31:23.513
(machine beeping)

31:23.582 --> 31:26.383
- Hayley! Bp's dropping.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.185
Fast. Hey, stay with me,
stay with me.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.586
Just stay awake, eh? Just...

31:29.588 --> 31:31.020
(tense music)

31:31.824 --> 31:33.122
- Switch to sadie.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.660
- Hey, hold on.

31:36.795 --> 31:37.860
Hold on, kid.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.463
- Her abdomen's rigid.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.131
She's got internal injuries,
maybe a ruptured diaphragm.

31:42.167 --> 31:43.967
What's the eta
on the other medevac?

31:43.969 --> 31:45.635
- There isn't one available.
- What?

31:45.638 --> 31:47.904
Wheezer and reese are on a call
with stef in ontario.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.106
Lex and nowak are taking
a cardiac patient to winnipeg,

31:50.108 --> 31:52.275
They're both an hour away.
Everyone else dutied out.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.944
- I can't take two critical
patients in a plane.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.879
Uh, the transport van!

31:56.916 --> 31:58.881
Can jeremy take sadie on that
to the nearest hospital?

31:58.918 --> 32:01.018
- Yeah, 90 minutes, plus 45

32:01.153 --> 32:03.120
If we take the other patient
to the airport first.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.721
- Sadie's more stable,
she can go in the van.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.089
- Start the splint.
- On it.

32:06.091 --> 32:09.025
- No. No, you...
Put my daughter in the plane.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.161
- I know you're worried about
your daughter, I get that,

32:11.230 --> 32:13.296
But you need a bigger hospital
like thompson, okay?

32:13.332 --> 32:15.098
- No.
- You need to go by plane!

32:15.167 --> 32:18.434
- No. I almost lost
her once tonight.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.637
Because of a stupid risk
that I took.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.906
You put her in the plane.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.842
- Look, the ambulance van,
it's just a transport vehicle.

32:25.844 --> 32:28.111
There's no major
medical supplies.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.380
The plane's faster.
- I am a lawyer, okay?

32:30.449 --> 32:33.983
I know that it is a patient's
right to refuse care.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.786
I am alert, I have capacity.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.724
Put my kid in the plane.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.760
(sadie crying)

32:43.796 --> 32:45.462
(sadie screaming)

32:46.665 --> 32:48.498
- Almost done, sadie, hold on.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.833
(sadie screaming, crying)

32:51.870 --> 32:54.904
- Please, please.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.141
I don't care if this
is my dying wish.

33:00.078 --> 33:01.344
I want this.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.718
Please, please, please...

33:11.690 --> 33:13.423
(tense music)

33:13.459 --> 33:15.558
- Do you think there may be
some personal factors

33:15.627 --> 33:18.095
That might have influenced
your decisions?

33:24.903 --> 33:26.169
- No.

33:32.911 --> 33:34.310
<i> (hayley): We have to split up.</i>

33:34.346 --> 33:35.779
Leah needs to go straight
to brandon hospital.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.781
Bodie and I will take sadie
to the plane on an atv.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.916
- If we're gonna take
the mom to brandon,
you should go with her.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.585
- You can't give narcotics.
Sadie's on fentanyl,

33:41.720 --> 33:43.719
You won't be able to manage her
during transport. I have to go

33:43.756 --> 33:46.056
With her on the plane.
Look, you can push fluids
and give oxygen.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.657
That's all I'd be able
to do for her anyway

33:47.726 --> 33:49.559
Until she gets to a hospital.
Here.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.595
I'm giving you
all my saline, okay?

33:55.200 --> 33:58.068
Just keep pushing fluid,
put a pressure bag on it.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.602
You got this.

33:59.671 --> 34:00.871
Okay?

34:05.176 --> 34:06.410
(ominous tone)

34:19.391 --> 34:21.091
- We were fighting.

34:21.093 --> 34:22.626
Right before it happened.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.427
I told her I didn't
want to be with her.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.997
- Hey, your mom reminds me
of my mom.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.100
She's a tough cookie.
- Did you two fight?

34:30.169 --> 34:31.301
- Sometimes.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.638
I, um, didn't always do
what she wanted me to do.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.575
And I...
Didn't always make her feel

34:38.644 --> 34:40.943
Like I wanted to be with her.

34:44.116 --> 34:47.851
- Did your mom forgive you?

34:49.254 --> 34:51.321
(tense music)

34:51.456 --> 34:53.657
(machine beeping rapidly)

34:56.361 --> 34:57.527
- Your bp's dropping.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.062
- I feel funny.

34:59.131 --> 35:02.031
I feel...
- Sadie, sadie!

35:03.869 --> 35:05.068
- What is this?
What's wrong?

35:05.070 --> 35:06.503
- Her femur must've
nicked an artery.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.037
She's got an internal bleed.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.140
I don't have the saline...

35:10.275 --> 35:11.941
I gave it all to jeremy. Ugh!

35:11.977 --> 35:13.543
- Is there anything
you can replace it with?

35:13.579 --> 35:15.678
- No! Radio the ambulance
in thompson,

35:15.747 --> 35:17.747
Tell them to have fluids
standing by.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.082
- Got it.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.885
- C'mon, sadie, stay with me.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.087
Stay with me, sadie.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.756
Nine-year-old girl,
distal femur fracture,

35:26.758 --> 35:28.758
Developed internal bleeding
in flight, bp 80 on 50.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.093
Get her to the or stat.

35:30.228 --> 35:31.494
(phone ringing)

35:31.563 --> 35:32.963
(phone beeps)

35:33.098 --> 35:36.032
Officer bird, um, you can tell
leah that sadie's okay.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.634
She developed
a femoral bleed mid-flight,

35:37.636 --> 35:39.635
But I got her to the or.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.437
How's leah, how's mom?

35:45.377 --> 35:47.577
(melancholic music)

36:03.162 --> 36:05.729
Leah would still be alive

36:05.864 --> 36:08.665
If I'd taken her
on the plane with me.

36:10.135 --> 36:12.536
She wouldn't have died
from a ruptured diaphragm.

36:13.639 --> 36:16.139
- Leah brooks died
from a brain aneurysm.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.877
- No, her... Her injuries
were to her abdomen.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.480
- From the accident, yes.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.015
But jeremy wood followed
your instructions perfectly.

36:27.152 --> 36:29.285
Leah arrived at
the brandon hospital alive.

36:29.421 --> 36:30.954
And she likely could have
survived the injuries

36:31.023 --> 36:32.956
To her abdomen.

36:33.025 --> 36:36.492
But she had an undiagnosed
brain aneurysm.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.761
The trauma from the crash
caused a slow leak.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.496
No one caught it
until anesthetist

36:40.532 --> 36:42.098
Was prepping her
for surgery in brandon

36:42.100 --> 36:44.267
And saw one of her
pupils was blown.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.769
She died minutes later.

36:45.771 --> 36:49.105
- I did a... I did
neurological assessment.

36:49.107 --> 36:50.907
- The assessment
would have been normal then

36:50.909 --> 36:52.508
Because it was a slow leak.

36:52.578 --> 36:55.044
And the symptoms
of a leaking brain aneurysm,

36:55.113 --> 36:57.180
Sob, loc, headache,

36:57.315 --> 36:59.983
Are the same as the symptoms
from her ruptured diaphragm.

37:00.052 --> 37:02.786
There's no way you could've
caught it, ms. Roberts.

37:08.694 --> 37:11.527
You do understand
the point of my inquiry

37:11.529 --> 37:13.863
Is not to assign fault
in leah brooks' death.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.534
It was an awful
and unfortunate coincidence

37:17.669 --> 37:20.436
That leah had an undiagnosed
brain aneurysm.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.342
- Um...

37:27.346 --> 37:29.345
So what was the point
of all of this?

37:29.481 --> 37:31.748
- The coroner investigates
any death

37:31.750 --> 37:33.683
Within 24 hours
of admission to hospital

37:33.752 --> 37:36.419
To ascertain if a death
could have been prevented.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.223
I think this one could've been

37:40.292 --> 37:42.892
If the thompson region
wasn't struggling

37:42.928 --> 37:45.028
With a critical
lack of resources.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.898
You were at tch the night
it was so understaffed

37:48.934 --> 37:50.833
Flight medics had
to keep the er open.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.838
I led this inquiry
because I am campaigning

37:54.840 --> 37:57.406
To recruit more staff
and increase

37:57.442 --> 37:59.208
The number of medevacs
available.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.913
No team should have to decide
between medevac'ing

38:03.949 --> 38:05.515
A critically ill woman

38:05.517 --> 38:07.049
Or her critically ill daughter.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.020
Not because of
lack of resources.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.024
(soft emotional music)

38:19.331 --> 38:21.597
(medical machines beeping)

38:26.471 --> 38:28.637
(indistinct pa announcement)

38:33.545 --> 38:34.544
(sadie): Mom?

38:35.347 --> 38:36.679
Mom?

38:37.983 --> 38:39.181
Momma?

38:43.221 --> 38:45.621
- Sadie, it's hayley.

38:45.691 --> 38:48.157
From the plane,
I was your nurse, remember?

38:48.193 --> 38:50.159
- Momma?

38:50.195 --> 38:51.694
Momma?

38:53.932 --> 38:56.198
(soft emotional music)

38:58.903 --> 39:00.103
- Yeah.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.109
Yeah, I'm here.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.379
It's okay, sadie.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.116
- I'm sorry, mom.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.751
I thought that I didn't
want to be with you.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.856
- I don't blame you.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.993
I just wanted you to be okay.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.663
It's all I ever wanted.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.199
(exhales)

39:41.079 --> 39:43.012
And you don't have to ap--

39:46.017 --> 39:47.950
You don't have to apologize.

39:51.256 --> 39:52.889
There isn't anything...

39:55.093 --> 39:57.093
...I would never
forgive you for.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.030
(♪♪)

40:18.150 --> 40:20.416
(muffled sobbing)

40:35.300 --> 40:37.299
(indistinct chatter)

40:39.037 --> 40:40.069
- Hey.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.140
I'm sorry.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.143
I-I wanted to respect
your privacy, but I just...

40:47.278 --> 40:49.412
- A doctor who treats herself

40:49.481 --> 40:51.947
Has a fool for a patient.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.148
And I was a fool.

40:53.185 --> 40:55.284
I thought I was helping you,
crystal.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.120
Teaching you to play
the game by their rules.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.689
But you were right.

41:00.725 --> 41:04.827
You have to be there
on your own terms.

41:04.830 --> 41:08.698
And I should be one
of the people

41:08.700 --> 41:10.700
Helping you to change the rules.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.802
So thank you.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.806
Thank you for teaching me
something.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.042
- You ready to go?

41:21.913 --> 41:23.713
Taking yana home to kingston.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.414
To heal with family and friends.

41:29.221 --> 41:30.720
- To heal a lot more.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.424
(hopeful music)

41:40.332 --> 41:43.399
(inaudible conversation)

41:51.409 --> 41:54.510
(medical machines beeping)

42:20.205 --> 42:21.571
(knocking)

42:21.640 --> 42:22.838
- Come in.

42:27.779 --> 42:30.313
- Hey. Um...
(crying)

42:36.388 --> 42:40.356
I think you were right.

42:45.397 --> 42:47.997
I don't think
I can do this alone.

42:52.337 --> 42:55.070
And I think I need help.

43:02.380 --> 43:05.147
(sobbing)

43:15.026 --> 43:17.760
(tense music)

43:17.895 --> 43:20.897
Subtitling: Difuze
