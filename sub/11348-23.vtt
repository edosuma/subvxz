(announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.476 --> 00:10.244
sexually based offenses

00:10.278 --> 00:12.246
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.515
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.548 --> 00:16.384
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.417 --> 00:18.186
are members of an elite squad

00:18.219 --> 00:19.653
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.257
These are their stories.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.194
So the outlets are covered.
Corner padding.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.496
Miss Benson
toddler-proofed every inch.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.531
And he's been eating
a lot lately.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.533
How about outdoor activity?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.535
(Benson)
He has scheduled
exercise time at daycare,

00:34.568 --> 00:37.438
and, of course, the babysitter
takes him out every day.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.374
And Miss Benson spends weekends
and mornings with Noah.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.276
(Benson)
And at night,
of course, we read.

00:42.310 --> 00:46.114
Noah didn't have a lot of
verbal interaction as an infant,

00:46.147 --> 00:47.548
so I want to make sure
he doesn't get too far behind

00:47.581 --> 00:50.151
in his language development.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.253
Do you sing to him?
That's also important.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.588
- Of course.
- Good.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.225
You need a toddler bed before
he climbs out of that crib.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.460
Of course.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.429
Okay. So...

01:01.462 --> 01:04.165
You've passed
all your home studies.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.167
I'm going to recommend
you be approved

01:06.200 --> 01:09.069
- as an adoptive parent.
- Thank you.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.506
Thank you.
Okay.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.377
Thank you, Miss Jackson.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.379
Good luck, Miss Benson.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.381
[sighs]

01:23.751 --> 01:26.654
That's great, Olivia.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.222
So what's next?

01:28.256 --> 01:31.259
I'll confirm with the agency

01:31.292 --> 01:32.726
that Noah's free for adoption,

01:32.760 --> 01:36.664
then we initiate proceedings
and go before Judge Linden.

01:36.697 --> 01:40.368
Paperwork seems in order.
Noah's history.

01:40.401 --> 01:43.337
"Birth mother--deceased.
Birth father--unknown.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.273
- No other known--"
- Yeah, about that.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.542
There's something
that I should tell you.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.612
So we stumbled across
Noah's birth father

01:51.645 --> 01:53.647
during an investigation.

01:53.681 --> 01:57.551
There was a mother searching for
her missing daughter.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.554
(woman)
Please, Nina,

02:00.588 --> 02:02.323
where is Ariel?

02:02.356 --> 02:03.524
Look,
this is how it is.

02:03.557 --> 02:07.595
The morning after he beat her,
Timmer drove her to hell.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.762
He killed her?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.498
He took her to Johnny D.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.366
Johnny D keeps
his new girls chained up

02:12.400 --> 02:14.602
for a whole week,
lets all these pimps come in,

02:14.635 --> 02:17.238
do whatever they want to them.
That's how he breaks them.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.208
- Did you know about this?
- No. No, I swear.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.176
Timmer asked for you
by name.

02:22.210 --> 02:26.214
If you're lying to me,
you're dead.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.182
Hey, Timmer, this is Johnny D.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.251
Okay, now we know that
you sold Ariel to him.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.485
Come on.
Now, who told you that?

02:31.519 --> 02:34.488
I'm going to ask you again.
Where is he keeping the girl?

02:34.522 --> 02:35.589
You think I'm crazy?

02:35.623 --> 02:37.191
Nobody's gonna
talk about Johnny D.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.327
Look, he don't think twice
about killing a pimp,

02:39.360 --> 02:40.561
a whore, or a cop.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.197
Hey, drop the glass.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.266
All right, drop it now.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.602
Johnny Drake, aka Johnny D,
has run out of delaying tactics.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.572
We are proceeding to trial
on 17 counts of rape,

02:51.605 --> 02:53.341
assault, trafficking,
and kidnapping.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.342
Nice work taking this
from the Feds.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.476
You'll need us to testify?

02:55.509 --> 02:56.677
I'm assuming
that won't be problem.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.612
- Not at all.
- Lots of witnesses.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.982
- It's gonna be a long trial.
- I want him put away for life.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.618
All right, what can we do?

03:04.652 --> 03:07.555
Means you got to re-vet
every witness--no surprises.

03:09.557 --> 03:13.361
Counselor, walk you out?

03:14.462 --> 03:15.429
Something you need
to tell me?

03:15.463 --> 03:18.832
Just so you know,
I've decided to name Johnny D

03:18.866 --> 03:21.602
as Noah's birth father
on the adoption papers.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.237
No. We've talked about this.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.273
You are under no obligation
to do that.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.807
It's not material to what
he's being charged with.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.742
This isn't about the trial.

03:28.776 --> 03:33.414
The adoption paperwork lists
Noah's birth father as unknown.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.616
So what's the problem?

03:35.649 --> 03:39.520
[whispers] Lying doesn't
work out well for me.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.491
Okay.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.594
Johnny D, family court--
separate universes.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.028
He'll never find out.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.730
Maybe not,

03:49.763 --> 03:52.466
but someday Noah might.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.602
Or the courts.

03:54.635 --> 03:59.307
I don't want my life with Noah
to be built on a lie.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.343
Don't do this.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.645
Johnny D is a psychopath.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.481
Do not open this door.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.826
[cell door opens]

04:18.859 --> 04:20.861
Stay seated.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.399
[cell door opens]

04:28.469 --> 04:32.606
- What?
- Nice to see you, too, Johnny.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.344
Remember this girl--
Ellie Porter?

04:37.845 --> 04:40.381
Crack whore who got
set on fire. Wait...

04:40.414 --> 04:42.683
Are they trying to pin her
on me now?

04:42.716 --> 04:45.285
Relax. Someone else
took that rap.

04:47.688 --> 04:51.659
So, why am I
supposed to give a crap?

04:51.692 --> 04:55.829
Because she may be
your get-out-of-jail-free card.

05:49.016 --> 05:49.983
I think I get why the Feds
kicked this case to Barba.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.351
'Cause nobody wants to do

05:51.385 --> 05:52.185
any more work than
they have to.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.455
- Our bust, our case.
- That's true...

05:54.488 --> 05:56.657
but geopolitically, Johnny D
is a Canadian national.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.459
And they won't extradite
a U.S. citizen back here

05:58.492 --> 06:00.027
- for a capital crime.
- Exactly.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.630
(Carisi)
So, rather than risk
in an international brouhaha,

06:02.663 --> 06:04.932
they give the case
to Barba.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.767
We should've shot him
when we had the chance.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.003
Probably. 'Cause even if Barba
gets a conviction on all counts,

06:10.037 --> 06:13.974
he's looking at 25 to life.
He could be paroled in 15.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.677
Okay, Barba, keep me posted.

06:16.710 --> 06:21.048
- Liv. Hey, you got a minute?
- Yeah, of course. Come in.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.016
What's up?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.685
Fin mentioned
you're up for lieutenant

06:24.718 --> 06:26.520
and that you might need
a new sergeant.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.656
Right now, that's just talk.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.493
Well, deadline's Friday.
Same with the sergeant's exam.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.194
I just registered.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.664
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.999
I'd like to try
moving up the ranks.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.769
After watching Munch,
and you,

06:41.802 --> 06:44.071
it's a track
I can see myself on.

06:44.104 --> 06:48.075
Of course. Just so you know,
I had to approach Fin first,

06:48.108 --> 06:49.777
- 'cause he has seniority.
- I get that.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.045
But he told me
he's not interested in

06:52.079 --> 06:55.483
the administrative part
of the job and, well, I am.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.688
Okay. Good.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.055
Good.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.791
Start studying.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.794
I already have.
[chuckles]

07:07.828 --> 07:10.163
[door opens]

07:12.099 --> 07:14.167
Mr. Braun, walk me
through this.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.836
Your Honor,
we are moving for

07:15.869 --> 07:17.771
an immediate dismissal
of all charges.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.740
The lead investigator,
Sergeant Olivia Benson,

07:19.773 --> 07:21.775
was informed some time ago
by the M.E.'s office

07:21.809 --> 07:23.744
that my client,
unbeknownst to him,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.013
is the biological father
of the foster child

07:26.046 --> 07:28.248
- she's attempting to adopt.
- Your Honor, it's immaterial.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.018
Yeah, unless Sergeant Benson's
pursuit of my client

07:31.051 --> 07:33.721
is motivated by her desire
to deny his parental rights.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.123
(Barba)
Sergeant Benson
was not aware of the DNA

07:36.156 --> 07:38.058
until after Mr. Drake
was processed.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.260
His DNA was not in the system
prior to this arrest.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.262
- Mr. Braun.
- Both SVU and the DA's office

07:42.295 --> 07:44.064
have offered numerous deals

07:44.097 --> 07:46.199
in exchange for testimony
against my client,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.268
and they even wrested the case
away from the FBI.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.638
If it smells like a vendetta
and looks like a vendetta...

07:50.671 --> 07:52.039
Mr. Drake was arrested
by Sergeant Benson

07:52.072 --> 07:53.707
in the presence
of other officers

07:53.741 --> 07:54.875
while attempting
to flee a dungeon

07:54.908 --> 07:58.078
where he was keeping 4 girls
imprisoned as sex slaves.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.213
He's a dangerous
career criminal.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.149
And yet his DNA
is not in the system?

08:02.182 --> 08:05.786
Career criminal, or the victim
of a single-minded blood feud?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.821
This allegation of a vendetta
is completely fabricated.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.823
This motion itself
is an overreach.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.760
All right, Mr. Barba. Save the
Ivy League oratory for trial,

08:12.793 --> 08:14.127
if we get there.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.196
Before I rule on
defense's motion,

08:16.229 --> 08:18.599
I'll need to speak to the M.E.'s
office and Sergeant Benson.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.500
We're adjourned.
[taps gavel]

08:22.870 --> 08:25.539
- Olivia.
- Hey.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.742
Thank you for meeting me here.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.644
Your squad
know about the situation?

08:30.678 --> 08:34.181
They do now.
Listen, just to be clear,

08:34.214 --> 08:38.919
I did not know that Johnny D
was Noah's biological parent

08:38.952 --> 08:41.689
- until after the arrest.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.756
All right.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.325
The M.E. confirms, we don't
have a problem with it.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.294
I mean, you probably should have
kept it to yourself.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.330
This scumbag will use
any leverage he has.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.800
But either way,
as far as IAB is concerned,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.602
you have absolutely
no liability.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.604
Thank you.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.806
- Is that tea?
- It is.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.908
Man up, will you?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.877
- Fine.
- That was easy.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.946
Can I get two glasses of...

09:05.979 --> 09:08.882
Of the Nero d'Avola.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.851
Listen, while you're here,

09:10.884 --> 09:13.286
I wanted to run something
past you.

09:13.320 --> 09:17.825
Uh, Nick Amaro applied for
the sergeant's exam.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.359
- Did he?
- Yeah.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.328
You told me to think about
my number two,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.764
and I think he'll do very well
on the test.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.298
Thank you.

09:25.332 --> 09:29.837
It doesn't matter if he gets
a perfect score on the test.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.672
He's damaged goods.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.907
He's a solid cop.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.809
And lately,
he's turned things around.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.344
He shot an unarmed
14-year-old kid,

09:37.377 --> 09:39.880
chased after three others
with a baseball bat,

09:39.913 --> 09:41.682
- beat an innocent suspect--
- Stop.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.651
In all of those cases,
he was exonerated.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.853
Technically, yes,
but realistically,

09:45.886 --> 09:49.690
the way One PP sees it,
Amaro could cure cancer.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.625
They're still not
gonna promote him.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.861
Listen, I know
you like the guy,

09:53.894 --> 09:55.863
but this is never
going to happen.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.297
Got it.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.737
(woman)
Right this way,
Mr. Braun.

10:03.771 --> 10:08.275
Hmm. Nice digs.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.977
My tax dollars at work.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.413
Taxes? Don't most of
your clients pay you cash?

10:13.446 --> 10:16.349
Ha. That's funny.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.018
What can I do for you?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.787
Well, while my motion
is pending,

10:19.820 --> 10:21.889
I thought it'd be
a good time to be proactive.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.857
- Mm-hmm. Go on.
- Here's what I can offer.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.426
Johnny Drake had no knowledge
of this child's existence,

10:26.459 --> 10:29.229
and he has been deprived
of his parental rights,

10:29.262 --> 10:30.898
and he wants to do
everything he can

10:30.931 --> 10:33.901
to assert those rights
and to be a good father

10:33.934 --> 10:35.903
to Noah Porter.

10:35.936 --> 10:39.873
Does he? Little hard to do
when you're serving 25 to life.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.975
Here's where that
proactivity part comes in.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.312
- Absolutely not.
- Will you just let me finish?

10:45.345 --> 10:48.749
Johnny D will relinquish
all parental rights

10:48.782 --> 10:49.850
and waive visitation.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.852
Noah won't ever have to know
he existed.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.921
- He doesn't get to do this.
- As I was trying to say...

10:53.954 --> 10:55.422
they've offered a plea of

10:55.455 --> 10:56.957
three to five years
for prostitution,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.792
which, I agree,
is not enough.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.894
- Not enough?
- But I think I can sell them...

11:00.928 --> 11:02.996
on one count of trafficking,
pleaded down.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.465
Braun indicated
they might accept ten years.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.835
Yes, because he knows
that if this goes to trial

11:07.868 --> 11:09.837
that Johnny D will spend
the rest of his life in prison.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.839
He sex-trafficked
underaged girls.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.907
He raped them,
he brutalized them.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.408
He does not get to
plea this down

11:15.442 --> 11:17.811
because I want to make my life
less complicated.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.813
Okay. There's something else
you should know.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.849
Regardless of whether
he is convicted or not,

11:21.882 --> 11:23.851
he can still appeal
for his parental rights.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.853
He could request, and has
a good shot at getting,

11:25.886 --> 11:27.721
court-ordered visitation.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.489
You could be taking your son
to visit Johnny D

11:39.800 --> 11:40.533
You applied for
the sergeant's exam?

11:41.434 --> 11:42.402
Seriously?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.171
Yeah. Why?

11:44.204 --> 11:47.074
I don't know.
What'd Liv say?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.977
She thought it was a good idea.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.079
Well, all right.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.881
You should think about
taking it.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.248
You'd be on
the fast track here.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.316
Don't want to be
a detective forever.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.417
Yeah, I do.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.387
I'm good as I am.
My life is perfect.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.022
Must be nice.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.291
Hey, anybody
heard from Sarge? She's late.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.093
She's dealing with a lot
right now.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.830
Oh, good, you're all here.
So I just met with Barba.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.900
The judge threw out
Johnny D's motion,

12:12.933 --> 12:16.036
so it looks like we'll be
going to trial in a few days.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.304
You're not going to
testify, are you?

12:17.337 --> 12:19.139
I have to.
I was first one on scene.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.908
Yeah, if Barba doesn't call you,
the defense definitely will.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.275
They're going to try
and cast shade on you.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.077
Still say
we should've shot him.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.879
Okay, Fin.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.915
So, Barba needs to schedule
prep time with all of you.

12:27.948 --> 12:31.418
He also wants to assign each
of us to one of the witnesses.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.855
- As bodyguards?
- No. More as confidants...

12:34.888 --> 12:36.389
so they know that
we're looking out for them.

12:36.423 --> 12:40.327
Also so we can let Barba know
if anyone gets shaky.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.163
- So we bond with them.
- What about Selena and Timmer?

12:43.196 --> 12:45.132
Their deal says
they have to testify.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.901
They're both up at Sing Sing.
Make sure they feel secure.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.170
Hey, Johnny D's
not getting away, Liv.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.340
Yeah. Nick, you got a sec?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.242
Sure.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.313
So...

13:00.347 --> 13:03.050
I was talking to Tucker.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.953
Tucker. What does he think
I did now?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.487
It's not him.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.957
It's the department.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.092
What does that mean?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.494
It means that he thinks

13:14.527 --> 13:17.497
that there's no point in you
taking the sergeant's exam.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.833
He thinks they'll just
round-robin you out.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.172
I get it.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.007
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.375
What was it Munch said,

13:28.408 --> 13:30.343
"Don't fall in love
with the job, kid.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.046
She'll never love you back."

13:34.147 --> 13:35.448
[door thuds]

13:40.220 --> 13:42.122
(Jessie)
Been good for me here.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.490
Cleaned up.
Just working my program.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.525
- One day at a time, right?
- You got it.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.095
Well, if you have any questions
about the trial or whatever,

13:48.128 --> 13:49.529
we're here for you.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.265
Yes, I believe you.
I believe my social worker.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.401
I know I have to testify.
It's the right thing.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.403
(Carisi)
Okay.
That's good to hear.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.906
Whatever you guys want,
I do.

13:58.939 --> 14:02.275
How about we go over what
you'll be saying on the stand?

14:02.309 --> 14:05.378
Thank you, Ariel,
thank you, Martha,

14:05.412 --> 14:07.247
for coming back to New York.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.282
Ariel, you look good.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.918
She's doing great.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.153
So, Johnny D's
going to trial.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.223
We just wanted
to prepare you to testify.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.959
That's why we're here.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.929
Screw you. I want to see
my son again.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.431
After you testify, right?
That's the deal.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.334
After I testify, I'll be dead.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.403
We are going to protect you.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.405
I don't believe you.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.043
So what, I just tell
the truth, the whole truth,

14:36.076 --> 14:37.377
nothing but the truth,
so help me?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.112
You got it.

14:39.146 --> 14:44.184
Look, don't worry about it.
Johnny D's going down.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.353
I'ma take care of that
for you, baby.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.421
- Hey.
- It's okay, Fin.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.358
Mr. Barba's gonna walk you
through your testimony--

14:51.391 --> 14:54.027
what you saw,
what you knew.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.996
No embellishments.

14:56.029 --> 14:59.032
I got this, and, um...

14:59.066 --> 15:01.134
you know I didn't mean
no offense by that, right?

15:01.168 --> 15:02.535
None taken.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.508
That guy's working us.
He's working you.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.243
I don't trust him.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.411
You don't have to
trust him, Fin.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.546
The only way he lives
to see summer

15:13.580 --> 15:16.116
is if Johnny D gets sent away.
He knows that.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.417
If you say so.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.320
Amaro just finished with Selena.
He's on his way out.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.555
Is he okay?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.525
He was all business about
taking that sergeant's exam,

15:25.558 --> 15:27.394
and after he talked to you,

15:27.427 --> 15:29.496
I saw him throw his prep book
in the garbage.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.365
NYPD doesn't want to
promote him.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.367
Wow. That's tough.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.403
(Amaro)
Hey, there you are.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.006
I trust Selena
about as far as I can throw her.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.440
Yeah, the same
goes for Timmer.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.075
(Fin)
We don't
have to trust them.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.645
They're both survivors,
and this is their last chance.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.381
(Amaro)
I hope you're right.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.155
Let's get out of here.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.397
During the investigation,
we became aware

16:04.431 --> 16:09.336
that Ariel was sold
to the defendant--Johnny Drake.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.071
(Barba)
And where was he
keeping Ariel?

16:11.104 --> 16:13.573
(Benson)
In Queens, in
an abandoned hospital basement.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.343
Ariel and three other
underaged girls

16:16.376 --> 16:19.279
were found locked up,
they were drugged,

16:19.312 --> 16:20.547
beaten, and raped.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.315
This is a process

16:22.349 --> 16:26.286
used by sex traffickers
called "breaking in."

16:26.319 --> 16:30.323
The girls suffer physical
and emotional torture,

16:30.357 --> 16:32.425
which basically destroys

16:32.459 --> 16:35.562
any impulse they have
to fight back or escape.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.531
And when you and the other
detectives arrived at the scene,

16:38.565 --> 16:40.300
what happened?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.402
We were able to rescue
three of the girls.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.438
They all had injuries
that were consistent with

16:45.472 --> 16:46.639
being brutally beaten.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.342
They had bruising,
broken ribs, lacerations.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.312
We later found out that
the girls were gang-raped

16:52.345 --> 16:57.117
and tortured by Johnny D
and several of his pimps.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.618
Your Honor, exhibit "A"--

16:58.651 --> 17:01.454
The medical report
on the victims.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.690
The M.E. and the girls
will testify

17:03.723 --> 17:06.226
to what they suffered
in Mr. Drake's custody.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.361
Tell us
what happened next.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.163
Well, we heard the sound
of breaking glass,

17:10.197 --> 17:11.698
and when
we ran down the hallway,

17:11.731 --> 17:14.634
we found Johnny D
attempting to escape

17:14.667 --> 17:17.237
with Ariel Thornhill
as his hostage.

17:17.270 --> 17:21.341
He was holding a shard of glass
to her neck.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.643
Eventually he surrendered,

17:23.676 --> 17:25.512
at which time, we placed him
under arrest

17:25.545 --> 17:27.280
and read him his rights.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.481
Do you see the man
you apprehended

17:28.515 --> 17:30.750
- in this courtroom today?
- Yes, I do.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.619
He's right there.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.223
Thank you, Sergeant Benson.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.627
Afternoon, Sergeant Benson.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.230
Thank you
for sparing the time.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.465
You're not just a sergeant
at SVU.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.699
You're also foster mother
to a toddler, correct?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.468
Your Honor,
we have been over this.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.238
- Sergeant Benson only--
- Gentlemen, approach.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.245
Now that it's just
the three of us, Mr. Barba.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.746
Sergeant Benson
only became aware

17:59.779 --> 18:01.381
that Mr. Drake was her son's
birth father

18:01.414 --> 18:03.250
after he was in police custody.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.218
But not after the investigation
was completed.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.387
The M.E.'s office's
statement

18:07.420 --> 18:09.689
confirms that Sergeant Benson
was informed

18:09.722 --> 18:11.458
one day after the arrest,

18:11.491 --> 18:13.293
which was before my client
was even charged.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.661
- Completely irrelevant.
- Not to my client.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.663
The jury is entitled
to hear about

18:16.696 --> 18:18.431
Sergeant's Benson's
conflict of interest

18:18.465 --> 18:20.567
and possibly the DA's.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.701
When did you became aware of

18:21.734 --> 18:22.869
the child's parentage,
Counselor?

18:22.902 --> 18:26.173
Your Honor, that may fall under
attorney-client privilege.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.574
While you're both
working on this case

18:27.607 --> 18:29.476
for the city of New York,
I doubt that.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.612
But how about I spare you
the embarrassment

18:32.645 --> 18:34.481
and possible ethical jeopardy
of answering,

18:34.514 --> 18:36.649
and you agree to drop
the objection

18:36.683 --> 18:40.620
on this line of questioning.
Are we good?

18:44.324 --> 18:45.758
Sergeant Benson,

18:45.792 --> 18:48.328
you're in the process
of adopting your foster son,

18:48.361 --> 18:49.429
- correct?
- Yes, that is correct.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.231
And who did you disclose

18:51.264 --> 18:54.667
was the child's
birth father to the agency?

18:54.701 --> 18:55.802
Johnny Drake.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.504
The defendant,

18:57.537 --> 18:59.706
the same man that
you spent so much time

18:59.739 --> 19:03.343
singularly focused on
investigating and apprehending?

19:03.376 --> 19:06.646
And that had nothing to do
with the paternity issue.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.381
Well, you're trying to
adopt this child.

19:08.415 --> 19:12.319
Is it fair to say that
the father's right to custody

19:12.352 --> 19:14.687
- could interfere with that?
- Of course it's possible.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.589
- But it had nothing--
- Is it also fair to say

19:16.623 --> 19:17.690
that it's in your
best interest

19:17.724 --> 19:18.791
for my client
to be found guilty?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.328
My only interest
is in making sure

19:21.361 --> 19:25.365
that a sadistic,
violent sex trafficker

19:25.398 --> 19:27.400
be brought to justice.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.636
Frankly, your anger
seems personal to me.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.440
- Your Honor.
- Withdrawn. Nothing further.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.377
Sergeant Benson,
you may step down.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.779
Thank you, Your Honor.
The prosecution would now--

19:39.812 --> 19:41.548
Actually, we'll recess
for the day.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.750
Prosecution's case
will continue

19:43.783 --> 19:46.419
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Court is adjourned.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.691
How's my son,
Sergeant Benson?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.426
That's enough, Drake.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.895
I seen pictures.
I can't wait to meet him.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.664
That's never gonna happen.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.470
[reporters shouting]

20:03.503 --> 20:04.804
Liv, let's get you
out of here.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.440
- He got to me in there.
- It's not on you, Liv.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.476
The jury's not gonna believe
any of that crap.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.910
- Who's gonna testify next?
- It was gonna be the M.E...

20:10.943 --> 20:12.579
but I'm gonna move up
Timmer and Selena.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.381
I'll call and have them
transported.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.383
It's still early--you want to
take a ride up to Sing Sing?

20:16.416 --> 20:17.884
- Give 'em one last pep talk?
- Great idea. Go now.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.487
Liv, stairs.
[reporters shouting]

20:20.520 --> 20:21.921
I testify tomorrow?

20:21.954 --> 20:24.391
And after that,
you'll see your son.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.926
- If I live.
- We'll protect you.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.661
Trust us.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.664
You know how you survive
in here?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.466
You trust nobody.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.804
Yo, I'd like to change clothes,
you know, before court.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.506
- Get up out these greens.
- Tomorrow.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.773
You're a cooperating witness,

20:40.807 --> 20:42.509
so we'll give you
a little bit of latitude.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.910
You're gonna stay in a motel
tonight,

20:43.943 --> 20:45.378
get a good night's rest.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.514
Want you to look good
for that jury.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.416
Yeah. You know I won't
let you down, right, my brother?

20:49.449 --> 20:52.519
Look, I've been doing a lot of
thinking when I was inside, huh?

20:52.552 --> 20:54.787
I've spent all my life
running, drugging, and pimping.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.490
- I want to change that.
- Yeah, well, now's the time.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.326
(Timmer)
Yeah, man, I been
doing some reading, too.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.429
You know, the autobiography
of Malcolm X, Soul on Ice?

21:02.462 --> 21:05.432
I become aware
of what Eldridge Cleaver

21:05.465 --> 21:08.435
would call touching to
my higher uneducation.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.437
We got Selena Cruz.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.473
- Put her in.
- It's your last chance, Selena.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.997
How long you been
out of the van?

21:38.030 --> 21:39.732
What, you gonna write me up?

21:39.766 --> 21:41.468
You couldn't wait
20 minutes?

21:41.501 --> 21:43.903
[thudding]

21:45.638 --> 21:47.474
Drop it. Drop it!

21:47.507 --> 21:49.876
He attacked me.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.586
How the hell did this happen?
Two prisoners, two officers.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.355
One of 'em pulled over
for a cup of coffee,

22:02.389 --> 22:03.456
the other one
took a smoke break.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.458
They figure since Selena
and Timmer were testifying,

22:05.492 --> 22:07.427
- they were on our team.
- Or not.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.861
Start
a complete investigation

22:08.895 --> 22:11.431
into the background
of both officers.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.401
Deceased is male,
black, 30 years old.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.768
In good physical shape.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.070
Dr. Rudnick,
what've we got?

22:18.104 --> 22:21.841
Cause of death is severed
carotid and jugular artery.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.410
He bled out
in less than a minute.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.911
And the manner is homicide?

22:24.944 --> 22:25.912
Goes without saying,
Detective.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.515
The woman who did this
is claiming self-defense.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.817
- Anything that backs that up?
- In my opinion,

22:30.850 --> 22:33.119
given his size, she used
the element of surprise,

22:33.152 --> 22:35.522
sliced his throat
from ear to Adam's apple

22:35.555 --> 22:37.390
before he knew
he was under attack.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.725
Any defensive wounds?

22:38.758 --> 22:40.727
Some cuts on her hands
and arms.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.830
Absent video proof, it's
impossible to know the sequence.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.565
All right. Thank you.

22:45.598 --> 22:49.436
Counselor,
how's the trial going?

22:49.469 --> 22:51.103
Better before this happened.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.172
This Johnny D--he's a monster.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.576
The torture, the injuries
his victims suffered.

22:56.609 --> 23:00.146
Did the jury understand
the significance of my report?

23:00.179 --> 23:02.148
That every one
of those girls

23:02.181 --> 23:06.419
had left ribs
eight, nine, and ten broken?

23:06.453 --> 23:07.420
It's a strange coincidence

23:07.454 --> 23:10.557
unless one man has
a pattern to his beatings.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.459
We'll be calling you
to testify to that.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.461
It's horrible to think a man
could do that to a woman.

23:14.494 --> 23:17.597
And even worse that
he might get away with it.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.500
Thank you for your faith
in me, Doctor.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.005
Timmer pull out the blade.
He comes at me.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.007
He tells me
I'm never gonna testify.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.141
That he kill me first.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.144
So you grabbed it
and slit his throat?

23:32.178 --> 23:34.080
- That's right.
- Selena,

23:34.113 --> 23:36.182
you're half his size.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.851
How did you grab that blade?
Did you have help?

23:38.885 --> 23:41.153
He threatened
to kill my son.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.990
I found the strength
to fight back.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.459
Well, you're still
gonna have to testify.

23:46.493 --> 23:49.496
No. I don't care
what happen to me,

23:49.529 --> 23:51.531
but my son?

23:51.564 --> 23:53.900
You don't know Johnny
like I do.

23:53.933 --> 23:58.204
My Selena.
She can get fired up.

23:58.237 --> 24:01.874
Your Selena?
You had her kill Timmer?

24:01.908 --> 24:03.142
Why would I do that?

24:03.175 --> 24:04.511
He was going to testify
against you,

24:04.544 --> 24:06.178
so you had her
do your dirty work.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.180
My client's been in Rikers
since his arrest.

24:08.214 --> 24:10.917
No visitors.
Check the log.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.519
I had no reason
to kill Timmer.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.487
He was never going to
testify against me.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.188
That's not what he said.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.190
You bought that
Eldridge Cleaver line?

24:18.224 --> 24:21.193
I bet he called you
"my brother" too.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.496
We're done.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.532
- I should say so.
- Oh, before you go...

24:25.565 --> 24:29.536
my client has something
for your sergeant.

24:29.569 --> 24:32.872
A present...for my son.

24:37.910 --> 24:41.981
[laughs] Yeah, we'll make sure
she gets it.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.221
Leave it to The Ledger.

24:49.255 --> 24:52.959
Turns out, the female CO was
dating one of Johnny D's pimps.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.927
- She slipped Selena the blade.
- Great.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.063
We've already doubled security
on all four girls--

24:57.096 --> 24:59.198
Jessie, Nina, Pilar,
and Ariel.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.300
Doesn't matter.
He's already in their heads.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.202
So we keep going.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.137
The longer we wait,
the more spooked the girls get.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.608
Make sure they're ready
to take the stand tomorrow.

25:11.611 --> 25:15.114
Timmer bled out? Good.
He used to boot-stomp us.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.249
Okay. Well, we just wanted
to make sure

25:17.283 --> 25:19.686
that what happened
doesn't affect your testimony.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.888
- It don't.
- Okay, good.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.223
'Cause, Pilar, Johnny D's
gonna be in the courtroom.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.258
Just want to make sure
you're prepared for that.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.327
I'm not afraid. I'll look him
right in the eye.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.329
Thank you for coming in,
Miss Morenas.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.332
- You ready to take the stand?
- It's just for practice.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.167
Counselor wants to
go over it again.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.703
Okay, Detective Carisi.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.173
(Barba)
So let's get started.

25:41.207 --> 25:45.211
Miss Morenas, do you know
Johnny Drake?

25:45.244 --> 25:48.280
I was sold to him
by another pimp.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.684
Johnny D said he needed
to test me.

25:51.718 --> 25:55.121
He punched me and broke my ribs,
and then he raped me.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.155
And how old were you?

25:56.188 --> 25:58.290
I met Johnny D
when I was 15.

25:58.324 --> 26:02.261
And what happened at that time?

26:02.294 --> 26:04.063
Well...

26:07.199 --> 26:10.302
Do you need a minute,
Miss Morenas?

26:10.336 --> 26:12.639
No. I'm fine.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.240
Can you tell us what happened

26:14.273 --> 26:19.278
when you first met
the defendant--Johnny Drake?

26:19.311 --> 26:20.747
He offered me money.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.314
To have sex with him?

26:22.348 --> 26:25.184
No. To clean his apartment.

26:34.060 --> 26:37.063
I remind you
that you are under oath.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.998
Let me ask again,
Miss Morenas.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.633
When you first met
the defendant,

26:40.667 --> 26:44.003
was he a sex trafficker
who beat and raped you?

26:45.705 --> 26:47.674
No, he wasn't.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.375
You testified
to a grand jury

26:49.408 --> 26:51.711
that Mr. Drake
beat you and raped you.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.980
I remind you again
you are under oath.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.215
I only said that
so I wouldn't be deported.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.717
I'm illegal. I was afraid.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.185
Are you afraid of
Mr. Drake now?

26:59.218 --> 27:01.087
Is that why
you're changing your story?

27:01.120 --> 27:05.157
No. Johnny D never hurt
or raped me.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.094
He loves me,
and I love him.

27:08.127 --> 27:11.798
- Your Honor, I need to confer.
- I'll grant a one-hour recess.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.100
You can shout all you want.
I told the truth.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.002
- Barba...
- Get her out of here.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.307
- Counselor.
- What?

27:21.340 --> 27:24.110
That deal I shopped--
it's off the table,

27:24.143 --> 27:27.213
what with your star witness
being dead and all.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.717
You mean murdered by a hit
that your client ordered.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.284
We both know that's impossible.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.453
And now you've got a witness
reversing on the stand.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.388
It seems to me
that reasonable doubt

27:36.422 --> 27:38.257
is suddenly very reasonable.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.827
Whatever you're selling, Braun,
we're not interested.

27:40.860 --> 27:44.163
Well, you might be interested
in this.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.335
[door closes]

27:52.404 --> 27:54.874
"Johnny D is requesting
an emergency appeal

27:54.907 --> 27:57.810
"to reinstate
his parental rights

27:57.844 --> 28:00.179
"and stop the adoption
of his son--

28:13.459 --> 28:14.326
Tucker said this was
going to be a bad week.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.464
I'm calling in favors
to make sure

28:18.497 --> 28:20.166
the right judge rules
in this appeal.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.434
Trevor Langan,
Noah's attorney, he's on it.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.371
He says that the best move
would be to get a conviction.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.939
Good idea, but these girls

28:26.973 --> 28:29.809
are just so scared
for their lives or scarred.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.210
I'm worried
they're gonna fold, too.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.412
You know, they may not
listen to us,

28:33.445 --> 28:39.151
but there is somebody that knows
exactly what they went through.

28:41.988 --> 28:46.525
You know, I'm sorry to put
more pressure on you, Ariel.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.461
Don't be.
You saved my life.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.097
Yeah, one more thing.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.735
I wanted to give you this.

29:02.041 --> 29:05.044
"Fearlessness."

29:05.077 --> 29:07.046
It works.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.415
Thank you.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.252
So you've all
heard about Timmer,

29:13.285 --> 29:15.154
about Selena.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.423
And Pilar. Did Johnny D
threaten her?

29:17.456 --> 29:19.525
We don't know.
She's not talking.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.494
But what we do know

29:22.528 --> 29:26.032
is that we need each one of you
to tell your story.

29:26.065 --> 29:29.435
Let the jury hear about
the pain,

29:29.468 --> 29:34.206
about the brutality
that you've suffered.

29:34.240 --> 29:39.145
Let the jury see...Johnny D

29:39.178 --> 29:41.180
as the monster that he is,

29:41.213 --> 29:43.883
and they will
send him to prison

29:43.916 --> 29:47.519
for the rest of his life.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.023
Ariel.

29:53.492 --> 29:59.231
Johnny D treated me,
treated all of us,

29:59.265 --> 30:01.934
like we were nothing.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.904
Like we were worthless.

30:04.937 --> 30:08.107
Just a body to own,

30:08.140 --> 30:11.277
to beat, to rape...

30:13.112 --> 30:15.247
To kill

30:15.281 --> 30:17.516
so he could make money.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.553
I lived in fear.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.891
I cried every day

30:24.924 --> 30:28.895
until I couldn't cry anymore.

30:28.928 --> 30:34.300
Then I just...became numb.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.503
Like all of you.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.508
But we're free now.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.577
And Johnny D
doesn't control us.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.847
He doesn't own us.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.987
We don't have to be
afraid anymore.

31:00.359 --> 31:04.931
And testifying is the only way
to prove that.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.901
So promise yourselves,

31:08.935 --> 31:12.371
promise each other

31:12.404 --> 31:15.241
that you will get on
that stand tomorrow

31:15.274 --> 31:18.877
and you'll tell the truth.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.280
I promise.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.552
I promise.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.021
So do I.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.323
Me, too.

31:39.431 --> 31:43.102
I'd been forced to have sex
with 15 men in 12 hours.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.104
I was raw, bleeding.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.139
Johnny D forced me
to take drugs

31:47.173 --> 31:49.341
and then work another
12-hour shift.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.377
He chained me to the bed,

31:51.410 --> 31:54.246
and then brought in
his sickest friends.

31:54.280 --> 31:58.384
He let them do whatever they
wanted to me until I passed out.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.320
He said if I didn't bring him
other girls, my friends,

32:01.353 --> 32:04.290
he would rape
my little sister.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.993
She was 11.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.295
He was kicking her
in the head,

32:09.328 --> 32:12.298
and her eyes glazed over.

32:12.331 --> 32:15.734
He rolled her up in a rug
and took her out.

32:15.767 --> 32:20.306
I heard a gunshot, and...
I never saw her again.

32:20.339 --> 32:24.310
My pimp, Timmer, found out
that I was trying to escape,

32:24.343 --> 32:26.645
so he sold me to Johnny D.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.647
Sold you?

32:28.680 --> 32:31.250
Yeah. He said that after
a few weeks with Johnny,

32:31.283 --> 32:34.320
I'd crawl back to him.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.956
What happened when he first
brought you to Mr. Drake?

32:41.027 --> 32:44.396
I was stripped,
chained, raped,

32:44.430 --> 32:47.766
and sodomized repeatedly
by Johnny and four other pimps.

32:47.799 --> 32:53.405
A few days after, Johnny D
said we're going to a party.

32:53.439 --> 32:56.742
He forced me to do cocaine
and uppers

32:56.775 --> 32:59.745
so I could perform.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.014
We drove to the house.

33:02.048 --> 33:04.183
Cops were there.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.085
Johnny D accused me
of setting him up,

33:06.118 --> 33:09.355
so he slammed my head
against the window.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.790
He laughed.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.994
Told me the cops
were there looking for me.

33:17.796 --> 33:21.367
That my mother
was looking for me, too.

33:24.436 --> 33:27.406
What else did he say?

33:31.377 --> 33:34.146
That I'd never
see my mother again.

33:46.092 --> 33:49.128
Liv, those girls
did great today.

33:49.161 --> 33:52.064
Barba, too.
Timed his direct to Ariel

33:52.098 --> 33:54.733
so the judge had to adjourn
before Braun could cross.

33:54.766 --> 33:58.370
The jury replaying
what those girls said...

33:58.404 --> 34:00.206
not sleeping tonight.

34:00.239 --> 34:03.209
Between what he's done to them,
what he's doing to you...

34:03.242 --> 34:07.546
He's not going to do
anything to me.

34:07.579 --> 34:12.284
Liv, I was wrong
to add to your stress

34:12.318 --> 34:13.785
with this sergeant thing.

34:13.819 --> 34:14.786
No, it--

34:14.820 --> 34:18.524
Look, I put you in
a bad position, and I'm sorry.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.292
I know how hard that must've
been for you to hear.

34:20.326 --> 34:21.460
I'm sorry.

34:23.795 --> 34:27.166
But we'll get through this.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.800
Yes, we will.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.303
- See you in court tomorrow.
- Yeah.

34:31.337 --> 34:34.106
Liv, you see the look
on Johnny D's face

34:34.140 --> 34:36.275
when those girls testified?

34:36.308 --> 34:38.110
He knows he's done.

34:42.381 --> 34:46.352
Those were disturbing stories
you told, Miss Thornhill.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.321
And you've been a sex worker
for how many years now?

34:49.355 --> 34:51.157
- Objection.
- Sustained.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.824
I'll rephrase.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.394
How old were you
when you left home?

34:55.427 --> 34:58.497
I didn't leave.
I was kidnapped.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.399
But not by my client.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.901
- No.
- In fact...

35:02.934 --> 35:04.803
you'd only been working
together for a short time

35:04.836 --> 35:07.273
before he was arrested.
Isn't that so?

35:07.306 --> 35:09.875
I wasn't working.
I was held prisoner.

35:09.908 --> 35:13.312
Okay, and you'd been
held prisoner by others

35:13.345 --> 35:15.347
for three years prior.

35:15.381 --> 35:17.916
Have you ever been asked to
testify against anyone else?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.351
No.

35:19.385 --> 35:22.154
I see.
And Sergeant Benson--

35:22.188 --> 35:24.423
has she personally
prevailed upon you?

35:24.456 --> 35:25.857
I'm sorry, that means
pressured you,

35:25.891 --> 35:28.894
to testify
against Mr. Drake?

35:28.927 --> 35:31.230
[mouthing words]

35:31.263 --> 35:34.366
She asked, but I wanted to.

35:34.400 --> 35:39.371
He's a horrible man.
He raped me repeatedly.

35:39.405 --> 35:40.272
Liar!

35:40.306 --> 35:41.807
You're a lying bitch.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.908
Order. Order.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.410
How you can let her
lie like that?

35:44.443 --> 35:46.412
[gavel bangs]
- Order.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.947
One more outburst,
I will clear this gallery.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.816
You don't tell me to shut up.
You shut up.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.585
That's it. Officers,
every one of them out now.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.521
- Come on, let's go.
- What? Yo, leave her alone.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.289
- Get back.
- He's not doing nothing.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.257
You, out.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.426
[overlapping chatter]
- Calm down, calm down.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.931
- He has a gun.
- Stay back.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.667
- Drop the gun. Let her go.
- Everybody back off!

36:08.700 --> 36:10.269
[screaming]

36:10.302 --> 36:12.338
[gasps]

36:12.371 --> 36:15.607
- Nick. Nick, don't.
- Drop it.

36:22.714 --> 36:23.615
- How is he?
- We got to move. We got to go.

36:24.816 --> 36:27.586
- I'll ride in the ambulance.
- I'll meet you at Bellevue.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.957
- How's the judge?
- She's okay.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.692
She got hit in the shoulder.

36:33.725 --> 36:37.929
Ariel, you all right,
honey?

36:37.963 --> 36:39.698
Yeah, I think.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.909
She's gone. Point blank
through the temple.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.711
Johnny D?

36:52.744 --> 36:55.981
He's dead. Two in the chest.
Amaro got him.

36:56.014 --> 36:59.385
- Is he gonna make it?
- En route to Bellevue.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.990
Rollins, how's Nick?

37:05.023 --> 37:07.693
He's in surgery.
A bullet hit his liver,

37:07.726 --> 37:09.595
so they had to do
an emergency laparotomy.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.430
Now they're working on
his knee.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.999
The liver can heal itself,
but a bullet to the knee--

37:14.032 --> 37:15.867
Yeah, I know that, Carisi.

37:15.901 --> 37:19.471
Sorry. I'll get us
some coffee, okay?

37:19.505 --> 37:20.906
- Yeah.
- Amaro's okay?

37:20.939 --> 37:23.942
- Considering.
- Johnny D?

37:23.975 --> 37:27.012
He's dead.
The court officer, too.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.381
A judge and another CO
got hit.

37:29.415 --> 37:32.518
What was he thinking? Grabbing
a gun, shooting a judge?

37:32.551 --> 37:35.387
No way he was getting
out of that building alive.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.789
That's exactly
what he was thinking.

37:41.059 --> 37:44.430
Hey, Lucy, thank you
for staying.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.898
Oh, of course. How's Nick?

37:46.932 --> 37:50.836
Out of surgery, you know.
His mother's with him.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.639
[whispers]
It could've been worse.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.774
Hi, my love.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.008
You're still awake.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.977
He didn't want to sleep
without his mommy.

37:59.010 --> 38:03.449
Oh, mommy's home.
Mommy's home.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.016
Mommy's home.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.888
(Linden)
Father's recently deceased?

38:09.921 --> 38:12.424
Yes, and the agency
was unable to locate

38:12.458 --> 38:13.992
any living blood relatives.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.495
Okay. Sergeant Benson,

38:16.528 --> 38:20.499
are you willing to raise
this child as your lawful child?

38:20.532 --> 38:21.733
Yes.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.569
(Linden)
This child
will inherit from you.

38:23.602 --> 38:24.870
He will be treated
no differently

38:24.903 --> 38:27.005
than a biological child.
Do you agree?

38:27.038 --> 38:28.940
Yes.

38:30.041 --> 38:33.879
I know it's been a long year,
a hard process.

38:33.912 --> 38:38.450
But everything
seems to be in order.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.986
Congratulations, Olivia.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.991
And to you,
Noah Porter Benson.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.796
I'm signing off
on the adoption.

38:50.829 --> 38:51.963
Thank you, Judge.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.832
Thank you.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.902
All the best to you
and your family.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.604
Thank you.

39:00.639 --> 39:01.840
We did it.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.810
Noah Porter Benson.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.881
Congratulations, Liv.
You look happy.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.983
- I am.
- Amaro coming?

39:12.017 --> 39:13.619
Yeah. He's on his way.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.120
He's doing better,
right?

39:15.153 --> 39:18.089
Yeah. He's, you know,
only two weeks into PT,

39:18.123 --> 39:21.026
so it's gonna be
a long road.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.562
- Hey.
- There he is.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.531
Hey, you guys started
without us.

39:25.564 --> 39:28.033
Nick, Amanda,
thank you for coming.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.801
- For you.
- Wouldn't miss it.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.870
Thank you.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.972
So I'll be hobbling around
for three months.

39:34.005 --> 39:34.940
There may be a cane.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.908
Yeah. You're gonna be on
desk duty for a while.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.510
We'll work it out.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.045
About that.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.047
I haven't told
anyone else yet,

39:42.080 --> 39:44.049
but I've been talking
to my delegate.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.717
And with this knee injury,

39:45.751 --> 39:47.018
they're gonna try
and force me out.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.820
Hold on. We're gonna
fight that, Nick.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.989
You're young,
you're in good health.

39:51.022 --> 39:56.094
Liv...I'm not going anywhere
in the department, anyway.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.997
Look, I could retire now,
put in for 3/4 pay,

39:59.030 --> 40:01.633
tax free, and start over again
in California.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.001
Nick...

40:05.837 --> 40:07.539
Are you sure?

40:07.573 --> 40:10.642
Zara's in LA.
Gil's in San Diego.

40:10.676 --> 40:12.778
I am sure.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.148
I don't know what to say.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.721
I know I wasn't what
your old partner was for you.

40:22.754 --> 40:27.025
No, you weren't.

40:27.058 --> 40:30.596
I grew more in
my last 4 years with you

40:30.629 --> 40:32.931
than I did in the 12 years
that I was with him.

40:32.964 --> 40:36.735
You know, that relationship,
whatever it was,

40:36.768 --> 40:41.673
didn't allow for
anything else.

40:41.707 --> 40:46.044
But with you,
with your support...

40:48.079 --> 40:50.148
I have a family.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.585
Yes, you do.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.957
[whispers] You helped me grow.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.127
I appreciate you
saying that.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.064
Wow, so...

41:06.097 --> 41:09.067
whatever happens,
Nick Amaro,

41:09.100 --> 41:12.671
friends for life.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.906
Friends for life.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.991
- To family.
- To family.

41:33.024 --> 41:35.160
[glasses clink]

41:36.962 --> 41:38.096
Cheers.
