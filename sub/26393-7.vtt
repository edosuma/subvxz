WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:04.917
All right, fellas,
come on now.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.223
Let's go down
to the barbershop.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.008
Babe, we'll see you later.Okay, baby.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.880
Come here and give me
some of that sugar, girl.Uh-uh.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.490
No!
What you doing?

00:12.534 --> 00:14.057
Not with all that gray stubble.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.973
I'm too young and hot
to be messing with some old man.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.628
[chuckles] I might be
gray in the face,
Mm-hmm.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.325
but I'm young below
the waist, girl.
Uh-uh.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.240
Uh-uh, uh-uh,
get it, get it.Come on. Come on now.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.807
Oh!
Ah!

00:29.072 --> 00:32.032
Can't believe I
still live here.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.556
Yeah, I can't believe
there's only two of us.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.517
CALVIN: Oh, damn.
There's Dave.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.476
Shh. Let's sneak to the truck.
Nobody say anything--

00:41.519 --> 00:43.521
Hi, Dave!

00:43.565 --> 00:45.741
Hey, guys.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.873
If I knew you were
gonna be like this,

00:47.917 --> 00:49.875
it wouldn'tbe two of you.

00:49.919 --> 00:52.139
Hey, what's up, Dave?
Where are you headed?

00:52.182 --> 00:53.966
Oh, man, all over the place.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.752
Gemma gave me a big
honey-do list to take care of.

00:56.795 --> 01:00.060
Grocery shopping, dry cleaners,
The Container Store.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.411
That last one's just for me.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.197
How about you guys?
Where are you off to?

01:07.241 --> 01:08.764
We are headed
to the barbershop.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.071
Ooh, can I come? I've been
meaning to get my ears lowered.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.683
You've been meaning to what?

01:14.726 --> 01:16.815
Dave, I work with a
lot of white people,

01:16.859 --> 01:19.079
and even I don't know
what that means.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.820
"Getting your ears lowered"
means getting a haircut,

01:21.864 --> 01:24.649
'cause afterwards your shorter
hair looks higher in relation

01:24.693 --> 01:28.740
to your ears, so your ears
look lower by comparison.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.094
Uh, no, you can't come.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.052
Okay, why-why not?

01:36.096 --> 01:40.100
Dave, it's a black barbershop.
It's not Supercuts.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.579
Okay.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.407
Hey, look, don't
take it personally, Dave.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.235
It's just, our barbershop

01:45.279 --> 01:47.498
is not the friendliest place
when you're new.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.457
Yeah, it's barely friendly
when you're not new.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.676
[laughs] It's so...
it's so true.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.200
One time when he was six,

01:53.243 --> 01:55.158
he ate a bad
bean pie in there,

01:55.202 --> 01:57.943
and ever since then, they've
been calling him Farty Marty.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.945
[laughter]

01:59.989 --> 02:02.165
Look, I'm just saying, Dave,
if-if you walked in there,

02:02.209 --> 02:04.254
they would roast you
pretty hard.
Yeah.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.691
Well, it's cool. I can take it.
You know, back in Michigan,

02:06.735 --> 02:09.390
me and the 'Zoo Crew used to
bag on each other all the time.

02:09.433 --> 02:13.307
Again, work with white people.
No clue.

02:13.350 --> 02:17.180
Yeah, uh, what's the 'Zoo Crew?

02:17.224 --> 02:19.269
'Zoo Crew!

02:19.313 --> 02:22.142
That's what me and my boys used
to call ourselves, you know.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.144
Oh, we did everything together.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.102
We even had our own anthem.

02:27.669 --> 02:30.062
♪ Four best friends
from Kalamazoo ♪

02:30.106 --> 02:33.414
♪ Logan, Brad and Dave
and Logan Number Two. ♪

02:35.242 --> 02:38.854
Wait. So-so,
your four-man 'Zoo Crew

02:38.897 --> 02:41.552
had not one but two Logans?

02:41.596 --> 02:43.424
Yeah, man,
those are my bro-gans.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.299
No, you can't go.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.345
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:51.388 --> 02:52.563
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.788
Hey, hey, now, what's going on?

02:59.831 --> 03:01.398
What's happening?Que, chair open?

03:01.442 --> 03:03.444
It is now. Get up, Trey.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.533
But I'm next.

03:05.576 --> 03:09.101
Well, look at it this
way: you still are.

03:09.145 --> 03:11.234
[laughs]

03:11.278 --> 03:13.367
Hey, Harold,
turn that TV on, man.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.238
They're replaying the Rams game
from Thursday night.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.500
MALCOLM:
Oh, wait.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.502
Come on, Pop.
Black people are not supposed

03:18.546 --> 03:20.243
to be supporting football
right now.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.158
I'm not supposed to be
having milk, either,

03:22.202 --> 03:23.681
but it ain't stop me

03:23.725 --> 03:26.423
from eating two bowls
of Cap'n Crunch today.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.469
So you're really not
watching football, Malcolm?

03:28.512 --> 03:30.558
Not until Kaepernick
is back on the field.

03:30.601 --> 03:33.430
Well, you better
start liking soccer,

03:33.474 --> 03:35.867
'cause the only football
you're gonna see is,

03:35.911 --> 03:40.176
"Goal! Barcelona!"

03:40.220 --> 03:41.786
[laughter]
Really?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.442
Hey, what's up, everybody?

03:45.486 --> 03:47.270
[others greeting]What's up, Jeremiah?

03:47.314 --> 03:50.491
Look, I got socks, belts
and Spanx for sale.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.493
Keeping it tight
ain't just for the ladies.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.669
Am I right, fellas?

03:54.712 --> 03:58.063
Jeremiah, no self-respecting man
in here wants to buy any Spanx.

03:58.107 --> 04:01.284
Speak for yourself. That
Cap'n Crunch is sitting on me.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.375
Hey, Calvin!

04:07.464 --> 04:10.075
Oh, man, can you
believe this?

04:10.119 --> 04:11.599
No.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.035
Tell me the truth, man.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.429
Do you have a LoJack on me
or something?

04:15.472 --> 04:17.735
No, I was just picking up
my dry cleaning next door.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.433
Hey, everyone, I'm Dave.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.348
Oh.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.306
So this the neighbor
we've been hearing about?

04:23.350 --> 04:25.569
Calvin, you told them about me?

04:27.310 --> 04:28.746
Only good
things, I hope.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.270
Well, keep hope alive.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.837
[laughter]Well, since I'm here,

04:32.881 --> 04:34.448
why don't I hang out
for a while, get a haircut?

04:34.491 --> 04:36.798
Sorry, man. We only
use clippers here.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.539
We ain't got no mousse.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.018
[laughter]

04:40.062 --> 04:41.498
Actually, I don't
use mousse.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.195
This is natural volume.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.459
Okay.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.808
Hey, who does he remind you of?

04:46.851 --> 04:48.549
Well, you know,
a lot of people say Tom Cruise.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.507
Nah, nah, that ain't it.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.248
I got it. Rachel Maddow.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.425
[laughter]

04:55.469 --> 04:57.862
I told you, man, it was gonna
get rough around here.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.908
You should have just went
to The Container Store.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.649
Somebody say
containers?

05:06.001 --> 05:08.525
Wow. So, all these socks
for just four dollars?

05:08.569 --> 05:10.005
That's right.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.441
That's cheap.
Where'd you get 'em?

05:11.485 --> 05:15.097
OTHERS:
Whoa. Whoa.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.142
Oh. Are they... are they stolen?

05:17.186 --> 05:18.405
Dave![others groaning, murmuring]

05:19.623 --> 05:21.233
Uh-uh, I don't like this.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.713
Calvin, your neighbor's a cop.

05:22.757 --> 05:25.237
Relax, Jeremiah.
He's not a cop.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.326
How you know?

05:26.369 --> 05:28.719
Dave, are you a cop?
No.

05:28.763 --> 05:32.767
See? I don't know what he is,
but he's not a cop.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.900
And if he were, by law,
he would have to tell you, so...

05:35.944 --> 05:37.598
Oh, actually, that's not true.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.600
What? Oh, of course it is.

05:39.643 --> 05:42.907
Most people think it is because
they see it on TV all the time,

05:42.951 --> 05:45.257
but truth is, totally false.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.259
No, it's not.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.609
Well, how do you know?

05:48.652 --> 05:50.698
'Cause I see it on TV
all the time!

05:50.741 --> 05:53.614
[chuckles] Actually,
uh, Dave is right.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.616
Pop, I just
looked it up.

05:55.659 --> 05:56.617
Mm-hmm.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.575
Look at your boy Dave.

05:58.619 --> 06:02.362
He knows what he's talking
about morethan Calvin.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.711
[others murmuring]

06:03.754 --> 06:06.061
Look, so what, he knew that.

06:06.104 --> 06:09.412
Uh, even a blind squirrel
sometimes finds a nut.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.848
[chuckles]

06:10.892 --> 06:13.634
How would a blind
squirrel find a nut?

06:13.677 --> 06:14.939
Probably their sense of smell.

06:16.332 --> 06:18.290
It's highly-developed
in squirrels.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.380
Why are y'all even
listening to this guy?

06:20.423 --> 06:22.120
He just walked in here.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.948
Yeah, but he seems smart.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.863
Yo, Dave, I got a question.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.562
Is global warming racist?
Calvin says it is.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.433
Oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, hold on.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.262
I said the concept
of global warming is racist.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.872
I mean, think about it.

06:34.916 --> 06:38.049
Africa been hot all this time,
and nobody cared.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.704
But soon as it get hot
in Boston,

06:40.748 --> 06:43.925
ha, all of a sudden,
we got global warming.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.537
You know why?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.191
It's because they're worried
about Tom Brady.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.062
[others groaning, murmuring]

06:51.106 --> 06:52.673
I'm telling you,
they're worried about him.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.719
Well, you know, I-I did
hear on NPR the other day

06:55.763 --> 06:57.678
that seven of the ten countries
most affected

06:57.721 --> 07:00.158
by climate change
are in sub-Saharan Africa.

07:00.202 --> 07:04.249
And wealthier nations do cause
most of the world's pollution.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.643
So it isracist!

07:06.687 --> 07:08.732
I just said that.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.866
Yeah, but when Dave says it,
it sounds true, though.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.824
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.827
Maybe that's because
I look like Rachel Maddow.

07:16.871 --> 07:19.177
[laughter]

07:19.221 --> 07:21.441
I can't believe y'all.

07:21.484 --> 07:25.445
He heard it on NPR? So what?
I heard it on Steve Harvey.

07:27.359 --> 07:30.754
Yo, Dave, is Steve Harvey
a reliable source?

07:31.886 --> 07:33.322
All I know is
he's killing it

07:33.365 --> 07:35.498
on the Family Feud!
Yeah.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.631
Yeah. Just like
Dave is killing it

07:37.674 --> 07:39.197
in the barbershop,
right, Dad?

07:39.241 --> 07:41.461
No. Am I right?

07:41.504 --> 07:43.071
[laughs] Survey says!

07:43.114 --> 07:44.594
[imitates buzzer]

07:44.638 --> 07:46.901
[laughs]

07:48.946 --> 07:50.470
Who's the first
white guy

07:50.513 --> 07:52.123
to hold his own in
Que's barbershop?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.647
Me?

07:53.690 --> 07:55.649
[excited chatter]

07:55.692 --> 07:58.042
Good answer.
Good answer.

07:58.086 --> 08:01.263
Hey, Dave, can I ask you
for some advice?Yeah, sure.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.395
Well, first off,
my girl Keisha's trippin'.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.310
Well, why is she trippin'?Because we be beefin'.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.530
Why do you think you're beefin'?'Cause she be trippin'!

08:07.574 --> 08:09.706
CALVIN:
Listen, Trey,

08:09.750 --> 08:11.534
I told you, what you need
to do with Keisha...

08:11.578 --> 08:13.797
Shh. I want to hear
what he has to say.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.799
Did you just shush me?!

08:15.843 --> 08:18.585
Shh. Calvin,
let the man talk.

08:18.628 --> 08:21.370
Well, hold on.
Did youjust shush me?!

08:23.024 --> 08:26.549
Well, since she seems to be
the one that's trippin',

08:26.593 --> 08:28.595
I'd sit her down
and let her know

08:28.638 --> 08:30.684
how it makes you feel
when she trips,

08:30.727 --> 08:32.860
and subsequently beefs.

08:34.209 --> 08:37.473
That's it. That is it!

08:37.517 --> 08:39.736
I'm not gonna sit here
and let y'all shush me

08:39.780 --> 08:42.391
while y'all sit around
and listen to that guy.

08:42.434 --> 08:43.958
But, Daddy, you...Shh!

08:45.089 --> 08:46.830
But, Calvin, what...?
Shh!

08:47.309 --> 08:49.050
Shh! Shh!

08:49.093 --> 08:51.269
Shh...!

08:52.532 --> 08:54.534
Shh!

09:03.020 --> 09:05.588
Hey.
There you are.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.417
Oh.
I just got your text
about being at the barbershop.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.766
Have you been there
this whole time?

09:09.810 --> 09:11.507
Gemma, you should
have seen it.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.465
It was amazing.
At one point,

09:13.509 --> 09:16.033
the owner brought out drinks
and cigars for everyone.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.600
People started gambling.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.777
It was like being below deck
on the Titanic.

09:20.821 --> 09:24.259
That's great, but why does
your hair look exactly the same?

09:24.302 --> 09:28.350
I was having so much fun,
I forgot to get it cut.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.613
Oh. Well,
I'm happy for you.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.615
I know you've been
missing your friends.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.312
Ugh. Tell me about it.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.618
All I've had for
a social life

09:35.662 --> 09:37.881
since we moved here
has been you and Grover.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.625
Which I love.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.497
[laughs]
It's okay. I get it.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.282
Men need other men
to hang out with

09:47.325 --> 09:50.938
so you can get out
all your stupid testosterone.

09:50.981 --> 09:54.071
Just felt good
to hang out with guys again.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.725
Can I ask you a question?

09:55.769 --> 09:58.075
Do I look like Rachel Maddow
to you?

10:03.167 --> 10:05.648
[laughs]:
You do now.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.739
Hey, Tea Cup. Morning, baby.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.133
Don't "morning, baby" me,
Calvin.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.048
I had a dream last night

10:14.091 --> 10:16.354
that a wolverine was
attacking my shoulder,

10:16.398 --> 10:18.487
and when I woke up,
it was your beard.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.098
Really?
Mm-hmm.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.100
Man, I was thinking
about keeping it, babe.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.668
You know, I... I look
like a young Barry White.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.368
[imitating White]:
Oh, yeah, baby.

10:30.412 --> 10:33.545
Ah, no, baby.
[groans]

10:33.589 --> 10:36.418
You need to go back to that
shop today and get a shave.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.941
I don't want people
thinking I'm married

10:37.985 --> 10:39.682
to Frederick Douglass.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.076
[laughs]

10:42.119 --> 10:44.078
I'm not going back down
in there, Tina.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.340
They shushed me.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.124
Like I was
some kind of kid.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.649
Well, you know, Pop, the rea...Shh, Malcolm. I'm talking.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.609
I've been going
to that shop for 30 years.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.872
I mean, Dave comes
in there for one hour,

10:55.916 --> 10:58.483
now everybody's started
listening to him instead of me.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.094
It was disrespectful.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.704
I'll show you
something disrespectful.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.227
What's that?

11:03.271 --> 11:05.316
[woman laughing, siren wailing]What is that?

11:05.360 --> 11:08.363
Keisha burning
all of Trey's clothes.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.582
She's live-streaming it
right now.

11:10.626 --> 11:13.498
Ooh, when she
starts trippin',

11:13.542 --> 11:17.067
she sure means
it, doesn't she?

11:17.111 --> 11:19.461
Oh, damn,
she couldn't wait to exhale.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.419
Mm-mm.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.987
Well, that's what Trey gets
for listening to Dave.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.554
Like.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.036
Well, what's he doing
listening to Dave?

11:29.079 --> 11:31.038
He doesn't know
him like you do.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.475
Right.
You are
Calvin Butler.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.695
Nobody knows this community
better than you do.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.522
That's what I keep saying.

11:37.566 --> 11:40.438
Well, that's why you
need to go to that shop

11:40.482 --> 11:42.876
and remind people
who you are.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.442
You damn right.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.575
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do, too.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.185
And then you go get a shave.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.756
Come on, boys, come and watch
your daddy go to work down here.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.891
All right, y'all be good.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.850
Ooh, I sure do miss
burning clothes.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.333
Well, if you ask me,
the fairest compromise is

12:05.376 --> 12:07.770
you cut the grass one week,
and then you have your roommate

12:07.814 --> 12:09.903
cut it the next.That's a good idea, Dave.

12:09.946 --> 12:13.167
I'm gonna go home and tell my
mama that's how it's gonna be.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.953
Hey, hey, people.OTHERS: Hey!

12:16.997 --> 12:19.260
Oh! Calvin, you're back.
How you doing, man?

12:19.303 --> 12:21.653
I'm doing better than
Trey, that's for sure.

12:21.697 --> 12:22.829
What happened to Trey?

12:22.872 --> 12:25.135
Oh. Show him the
video, Marty.

12:25.179 --> 12:28.182
Oh, is that Keisha
burning all his stuff?

12:28.225 --> 12:30.184
[siren wailing on video]

12:30.227 --> 12:31.228
Yes.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.621
And that's what happens

12:32.664 --> 12:34.971
around here when you
don't listen to me.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.843
You get roasted.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.801
That's crazy that
Keisha would do that.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.586
No, it's not.
'Cause Keisha's crazy.

12:41.630 --> 12:46.069
But, see, y'all must've forgot
who knows you

12:46.113 --> 12:48.463
and always tries
to steer you right.

12:48.506 --> 12:49.594
I mean, like you, Jeremiah.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.596
I mean,
you up in here

12:51.640 --> 12:55.992
selling belts and socks like
some common barbershop hustler.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.212
Who the one told you
that the real money

12:58.255 --> 13:00.736
was in men's
compression undergarments?

13:02.216 --> 13:03.695
Calvin,
that's not fair.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.523
I'm gonna tell you
what's not fair.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.134
You making your mama
cut the grass

13:07.177 --> 13:09.310
when she got asthma
and a push mower.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.746
OTHERS: Oh!
Ooh!

13:10.790 --> 13:12.487
Que, you hear that?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.532
Dave, see, you
don't hear nothing.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.491
You're just out here
giving out advice,

13:16.534 --> 13:18.493
when you don't know
the whole story.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.538
See this right here?
This is myshop.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.279
Actually, Pop,
this is Que's shop.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.760
Boy, do you want
to get shushed again?

13:26.762 --> 13:28.808
Okay, you know what, uh, Calvin?

13:28.851 --> 13:31.071
I really don't
think that...You know what, Dave?

13:31.114 --> 13:34.335
I think you need to stop giving
out advice and start listening.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.771
I mean, that's
your problem.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.860
You're in here,
you're sitting in my chair,

13:37.904 --> 13:39.601
and you're overstepping.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.429
Come on, Pop.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.170
Now, get up and get out.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.521
Okay.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.436
I hear you. I'll go.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.307
Uh, Que, thanks for the cut.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.918
Jeremiah, I'll see you later.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.964
I'll call Trey
and tell him that I'm sorry.

13:55.008 --> 13:58.794
You can't. His phone got
thrown in the fire. Ha!

14:01.623 --> 14:02.537
Hi, guys.

14:02.580 --> 14:03.668
Oh, hey, Gemma.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.236
Hey, Calvin, you
shaved your beard.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.283
Uh, yeah.
Tina likes it better this way.

14:09.326 --> 14:12.852
Oh, I know. She is not
shy about her opinions.

14:12.895 --> 14:16.507
She told me I looked like
I was going to a hoedown.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.814
So, is Dave
still down at the shop?

14:18.858 --> 14:22.731
No. N-No, he left
a while ago.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.080
That's weird.
He hasn't come home.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.908
Did he say where he was going?

14:25.952 --> 14:29.651
He did not, no.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.740
He must be doing all the things

14:31.783 --> 14:34.525
on his honey-do list
he forgot to do yesterday.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.788
Or he's crying in the corner
at The Container Store.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.663
Well, I just want
to thank you guys.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.534
For what?Since we moved here,

14:43.578 --> 14:46.146
Dave's been having a really
hard time missing his friends.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.756
I just really
appreciate you

14:47.799 --> 14:50.280
being so willing to welcome him
down at the barbershop.

14:50.324 --> 14:53.196
We are so lucky to have you guys
as our neighbors.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.069
See ya.

14:56.112 --> 14:59.376
Why the hell
they have to move here?

15:04.381 --> 15:05.992
[chuckles]:
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

15:06.035 --> 15:10.779
Look at that
smooth baby skin, yes!

15:10.822 --> 15:13.825
Let me sit right here

15:13.869 --> 15:16.045
and kiss that
baby face! Mwa!Mmm.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.221
Mwa! Mwa! [laughs]

15:19.657 --> 15:20.963
What's the matter, baby?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.834
Eh, I'm just thinking.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.358
You ain't missing
that hedgehog

15:24.401 --> 15:26.316
that was on your
face, are you?

15:27.839 --> 15:29.798
No, babe,
it's nothing like that.

15:29.841 --> 15:33.845
I just... I think I went
too hard on Dave today

15:33.889 --> 15:35.978
down at the barbershop.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.850
Oh, you know, you
did warn him that...

15:38.894 --> 15:41.375
joking around can be
pretty rough down there.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.986
Yeah, I know,
but this was different.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.988
You know what, baby, I
would not worry about it.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.512
Dave is, like, the
happiest guy I ever met.

15:48.556 --> 15:51.037
You know, the other day,
I saw him high-five himself.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.386
[chuckles]

15:52.429 --> 15:53.648
Who does that?

15:53.691 --> 15:56.259
Yeah, one day, I saw him miss.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.305
[laughs]

16:00.742 --> 16:02.787
You're right, you're right.

16:02.831 --> 16:06.269
You know what? He's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.837
It's cool.
He'll be fine, but
in the meantime,

16:08.880 --> 16:11.753
let me get that...
that sugar.

Hey, Calvin.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.311
[sighs] So, you're missing
your friends back home, huh?

16:48.355 --> 16:50.183
Yeah. What gave it away?
Was it the song?

16:50.226 --> 16:52.011
[sighs]

16:52.054 --> 16:53.969
Look, man,
I know I came down on you

16:54.013 --> 16:55.927
kind of hard
at the barbershop today, man.

16:55.971 --> 16:58.321
I'm surprised
at how much it's affected me.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.323
You know,
I'm usually pretty tough.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.152
Look, but I told you what
it was like down there, man.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.850
We-we laugh,
we snap on each other,

17:05.894 --> 17:09.506
we buy wholesale items
of questionable origin.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.639
Yeah, but...

17:11.682 --> 17:14.555
it feels like what you
did to me was different.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.557
Look, I tried
to tell you, man,

17:16.600 --> 17:18.776
you don't belong
in the barbershop.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.300
Man, you just...

17:20.343 --> 17:21.953
you're a little
too sensitive for it.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.651
No, that's not true.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.306
I have no problem with
jokes about my awesome hair

17:26.349 --> 17:29.309
or how I look like
numerous celebrities,

17:29.352 --> 17:31.267
both male and female.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.967
But what you did
wasn't cool.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.882
But think about my position.

17:37.926 --> 17:40.755
I mean, I've been going
to that barbershop for 30 years.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.758
I know all those people in
there-- I know their history

17:43.801 --> 17:45.847
and their circumstance--
and then you come in

17:45.890 --> 17:49.981
with your NPR
and obscure animal facts...

17:50.025 --> 17:53.811
and everybody starts listening
to you instead of me.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.162
I mean, how you think
that makes me feel?

17:56.205 --> 17:58.729
Like they forgot about you?Exactly.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.775
Yeah, I know
how that feels.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.385
Check that out.

18:02.429 --> 18:05.997
Why-why are you showing me
a picture of a dude's butt?

18:06.041 --> 18:08.652
Look at the tattoo.

18:08.696 --> 18:12.003
Everyone in the 'Zoo Crew got
these last week without me.

18:12.047 --> 18:15.268
I've only been gone two months,
and it already feels like

18:15.311 --> 18:17.879
it doesn't matter
that I'm not there.

18:17.922 --> 18:21.404
So you feel leftbehind...

18:21.448 --> 18:24.842
by a bunch of dudes that
got tattoos ontheir behind?

18:29.020 --> 18:30.848
It's just been really
tough making friends

18:30.892 --> 18:32.285
since I moved
here, Calvin.

18:32.328 --> 18:33.938

You know, back at home, I mean,
I used to be the coolest.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.732
I mean, you know, you're...

18:44.775 --> 18:47.648
you're cool, you know?

18:47.691 --> 18:49.911
I mean, Dave, come on, man.

18:49.954 --> 18:53.871
You walked into Que's barbershop
and you held your own.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.004
It was pretty cool
that I did that.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.181
Won $200 playing dice.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.749
[chuckles] You might want
to check those twenties

19:01.792 --> 19:04.273
and make sure Obama's face
is not on them.

19:04.317 --> 19:07.363

19:07.407 --> 19:10.497
Hey, look, I'm sorry I messed
things up for you down at Que's.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.281
I promise I
won't come back.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.979
Oh, man, no, it's cool.
I mean, you're welcome in there

19:15.023 --> 19:17.852
anytime you want to...
get your ears lowered.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.942
Well, good,

19:20.985 --> 19:23.510
'cause I don't anybody else
who's gonna take my Obama bucks.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.599

19:25.642 --> 19:27.992
All right, man, I'll see you
down there next Saturday?

19:28.036 --> 19:30.865
Next Saturday?
That's in a week.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.736
Yo, how often
you get your hair cut?
