00:19.910 --> 00:22.840
The government has issued a statement concerning the recent influenza... 

00:22.840 --> 00:26.030
...strains found in Beijing. 

00:26.030 --> 00:29.140
Though this country has not had any infections to date... 

00:29.140 --> 00:34.160
...health authorities are paying special attention to tourists in China. 

00:34.600 --> 00:40.550
This Type A virus is similar to the 2009 swine influenza... 

00:40.550 --> 00:45.950
...and is transferable from person to person. 

00:46.550 --> 00:51.170
Although it is not as fatal as the 2009 swine influenza... 

00:51.170 --> 00:59.530
This virus can still kill unless there is an antibody. 

00:59.530 --> 01:02.330
Although there are no infections yet... 

01:02.330 --> 01:08.430
Please do not hesitate to get treated at your local hospital. 

01:27.500 --> 01:30.650
Infection 

01:32.590 --> 01:35.900
The first person to be infected in this country has been murdered. 

01:35.900 --> 01:39.210
This infection was already all over Beijing. 

01:41.670 --> 01:43.850
They said there's no one here who's been infected. 

01:43.850 --> 01:46.850
The press is just playing with our minds. 

01:46.850 --> 01:48.630
Looking at the corpse... 

01:48.630 --> 01:51.590
There's a good possibility that the criminal was infected by a virus. 

01:51.590 --> 01:57.200
As soon as the virus spreads,
the responsibility will fall on us. 

01:58.740 --> 02:02.630
So, are we taking on this case to stop the virus? 

02:03.260 --> 02:05.330
Or to reduce someone else's responsibility? 

02:06.670 --> 02:07.800
Both. 

02:08.580 --> 02:11.350
Catch the criminal and stop the virus too. 

02:12.790 --> 02:15.250
The criminal is the virus itself. 

02:15.250 --> 02:17.530
Murder and variants... 

02:18.470 --> 02:19.350
Interesting. 

02:20.400 --> 02:22.380
Director Yeo. 

02:23.730 --> 02:26.120
But, there is one problem. 

02:34.510 --> 02:36.710
Just one problem, my ass. 

02:36.710 --> 02:39.000
There's no separate sterile room? 

02:39.000 --> 02:40.810
How clean is this! 

02:41.600 --> 02:46.040
This is the first rule in the CDC manual for acute infectious diseases. 

02:47.190 --> 02:50.650
But the really did clear everything out.
Everything! 

02:51.420 --> 02:52.630
But still... 

02:52.630 --> 02:54.040
They cleared all of the bacteria. 

02:54.040 --> 02:56.460
Leaving us with zero evidence! 

02:57.200 --> 02:59.440
How do they expect us to solve this? 

03:00.940 --> 03:03.180
But don't you think they're overreacting? 

03:03.180 --> 03:05.420
The virus doesn't spread by air. 

03:06.970 --> 03:08.760
I'm an important person! 

03:11.080 --> 03:12.520
What do we have left to work with? 

03:12.520 --> 03:16.230
The victim's name is Hwang Sung Min.
Age: 44 

03:16.230 --> 03:18.480
His family lives in America. 

03:18.480 --> 03:21.970
He's a securities analyst from the Research Center. 

03:21.970 --> 03:24.910
There's a mark here! 

03:25.620 --> 03:27.400
Okay! Check it over! 

03:27.400 --> 03:28.200
Yes! 

03:31.110 --> 03:33.760
What's an analyst? What do they do? 

03:34.730 --> 03:36.210
What's an analyst? 

03:36.840 --> 03:40.170
Isn't it a job that judges value? 

03:40.170 --> 03:44.310
His decision is worth millions and billions! 

03:51.730 --> 03:54.750
The first attack happened in the bedroom. 

03:55.410 --> 03:58.710
The stab around the lower abdomen wasn't fatal. 

03:58.710 --> 04:00.850
The direct cause of death is here. 

04:01.500 --> 04:03.750
Excessive bleeding due to a rupture in the skull. 

04:03.750 --> 04:06.790
The blunt weapon was rectangular. 

04:06.790 --> 04:08.790
Sharp edges. 

04:08.790 --> 04:12.390
The criminal stabbed him several times in a row. 

04:14.270 --> 04:15.380
Perhaps a grudge? 

04:16.390 --> 04:18.000
He could've been scared. 

04:18.720 --> 04:20.019
That he would remain alive. 

04:20.990 --> 04:22.750
Time of death? 

04:22.750 --> 04:25.520
He was suffering from a high temperature due to the infection. 

04:25.520 --> 04:27.440
I can't give an accurate estimate but... 

04:27.440 --> 04:30.780
Around Saturday night between 8 PM to 12 AM? 

04:33.910 --> 04:38.570
After the first attack, he moved him. 

04:40.140 --> 04:41.620
Blood alcohol concentration? 

04:41.620 --> 04:43.900
I'm waiting for the blood samples. 

04:44.450 --> 04:47.020
Send the drug test with it and let me know when it's done. 

04:47.930 --> 04:49.160
Anything else? 

04:49.750 --> 04:51.100
Strangely enough... 

04:51.100 --> 04:54.560
There are long lasting wounds around the neck and wrist. 

04:54.560 --> 04:58.850
They seem to be continuously repeated wounds. 

04:59.370 --> 05:01.590
They form, then they're gone. 

05:09.510 --> 05:10.910
So much... 

05:10.910 --> 05:14.130
They brought in everything. 

05:14.130 --> 05:16.480
Yes, here's the list. 

05:18.590 --> 05:21.450
The video footage of the crime scene is in here. 

05:22.350 --> 05:25.320
Everything should be here so don't worry. 

05:30.130 --> 05:32.660
I heard you took all the evidence. 

05:32.660 --> 05:34.900
Samples would've been enough. 

05:34.900 --> 05:36.410
Don't you think you went a little overboard? 

05:36.410 --> 05:40.900
Epidemiology studies can prevent the spread of infection. 

05:40.900 --> 05:43.910
You're making our investigation more difficult. 

05:43.910 --> 05:48.850
Shouldn't it be your duty to protect 10 citizens instead of finding one criminal? 

05:48.850 --> 05:50.850
Isn't that what a policeman should do? 

05:50.850 --> 05:54.850
That one criminal can spread the virus to 10 different people. 

05:57.320 --> 05:59.400
Did you come to explain the virus? 

06:00.190 --> 06:02.630
It's an unusual strain of the influenza virus. 

06:02.630 --> 06:04.540
The main characteristic is its speed. 

06:04.540 --> 06:06.610
It dominates the host at a rapid speed. 

06:06.610 --> 06:09.690
The incubation period is around 24 to 48 hours. 

06:09.690 --> 06:12.650
Afterwards, if the patient does not get treated within 48 hours of infection... 

06:12.650 --> 06:15.740
The mortality rate moves up to 60%. 

06:15.740 --> 06:19.250
However, if the patient does receive treatment... 

06:21.750 --> 06:25.330
Recovery can be quick. 

06:27.190 --> 06:30.230
There will soon be signs of people getting infected by the criminal. 

06:31.160 --> 06:35.340
It sounds like you're just waiting for the infection to spread. 

06:36.580 --> 06:38.460
With new infections, the criminal will appear among them as well. 

06:38.460 --> 06:41.240
The sensitivity of the host could transform the form of the virus. 

06:41.240 --> 06:44.230
Plus, the virus's instinct for survival is beyond our imagination. 

06:45.190 --> 06:47.520
But the criminal's viability is just as strong. 

06:48.750 --> 06:50.190
Could it be this easy? 

06:52.310 --> 06:53.680
Well, I guess.... 

06:53.680 --> 06:55.770
Your plan makes sense too. 

06:55.770 --> 06:58.330
Find the criminal among the infections. 

06:59.810 --> 07:01.090
Let's work together. 

07:01.560 --> 07:03.500
You hurry and catch the criminal. 

07:03.500 --> 07:05.310
And we'll hurry and stop the infection. 

07:07.260 --> 07:08.070
Ah. 

07:08.760 --> 07:11.310
This office is big enough, right? 

08:16.460 --> 08:17.990
S Bar? 

08:39.730 --> 08:42.770
There are a lot of commonalities between an epidemiological investigation and a  criminal investigation. 

08:44.810 --> 08:47.080
They both reveal secrets.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.330
A job that exposes other people's secrets. 

08:50.330 --> 08:52.000
Doesn't that make you bitter sometimes? 

08:53.310 --> 08:54.210
Is that so? 

08:55.390 --> 08:57.260
It's always been interesting to me. 

08:58.530 --> 09:01.120
You never know what you'll find next. 

09:14.780 --> 09:18.150
Spread 

09:20.830 --> 09:22.530
Min Ho. 

09:22.530 --> 09:24.960
The log of all the elevator users... 

09:25.630 --> 09:27.970
Everything's already been confirmed. 

09:27.970 --> 09:30.390
Really? I understand. 

09:39.710 --> 09:42.920
He purposefully invaded a place without any cameras. 

09:45.160 --> 09:47.860
That means he came to kill. 

09:59.360 --> 10:00.360
Senior. 

10:02.120 --> 10:04.540
Check to see if there were any police reports in this building. 

10:05.000 --> 10:05.920
What? 

10:05.920 --> 10:06.790
Hurry. 

10:06.790 --> 10:07.510
Yes. 

10:37.290 --> 10:38.080
Senior. 

10:38.080 --> 10:40.210
There were a lot of reports around here. 

10:40.210 --> 10:41.280
Burglars? 

10:42.200 --> 10:43.280
How did you know? 

10:43.760 --> 10:46.010
He smelled the smell of money. 

10:46.010 --> 10:47.200
Let's look. 

10:48.090 --> 10:50.190
Once the goal was set,
it took a whole month. 

10:50.190 --> 10:51.800
To observe and determine the target. 

10:54.110 --> 10:57.080
On the big day, he started from the top and worked his way down. 

10:57.080 --> 10:59.080
Quickly, like a delivery man. 

11:01.230 --> 11:02.220
Dresser. 

11:07.160 --> 11:08.210
Bedside table. 

11:11.430 --> 11:12.290
Even the drawers. 

11:12.890 --> 11:14.450
He used the shortest distances. 

11:15.490 --> 11:17.350
It's a very economical move. 

11:25.820 --> 11:27.420
These shoes too. 

11:27.420 --> 11:28.730
Only real burglars wear these shoes. 

11:28.730 --> 11:30.070
The ones that don't make noise. 

11:31.790 --> 11:34.010
An unexpected visitor showed up here. 

11:34.010 --> 11:35.630
One the burglar didn't expect. 

11:35.630 --> 11:39.570
So... did he kill out of shock? 

11:40.290 --> 11:41.370
That's strange. 

11:43.070 --> 11:45.400
Burglars never do the killing. 

11:46.440 --> 11:49.470
Maybe he had a reason? Enough to kill? 

11:54.760 --> 11:55.980
You're going to ask him when you catch him. 

11:57.900 --> 11:59.430
Impressive. 

12:13.920 --> 12:14.930
Sweeper! 

12:20.520 --> 12:24.130
You're still good with your hands. 

12:24.130 --> 12:26.670
I noticed it that time you robbed an entire apartment complex. 

12:27.850 --> 12:29.760
That was so long ago. 

12:29.760 --> 12:31.480
Did anyone come to sell stolen goods? 

12:33.120 --> 12:35.090
What's the matter with you again? 

12:35.090 --> 12:38.400
I didn't come here to arrest you. 

12:38.400 --> 12:39.980
Nobody came. 

12:46.760 --> 12:47.560
Okay. 

12:49.510 --> 12:51.800
You know the guy who gives out certificates, right? 

12:56.630 --> 12:57.720
Doctor. 

13:01.140 --> 13:04.450
He made the hole by ripping off the latch... 

13:04.450 --> 13:06.850
Just took an endoscopy... 

13:06.850 --> 13:09.620
Made the ribbon out of string... 

13:11.460 --> 13:12.850
He covered up the paint too. 

13:12.850 --> 13:16.890
This probably means he's been in jail a lot. 

13:16.890 --> 13:19.140
He practically lives in jail. 

13:22.320 --> 13:24.860
Let's filter out the extreme ones. 

13:24.860 --> 13:26.130
How many people are left? 

13:29.090 --> 13:29.830
Hey! 

13:33.470 --> 13:34.890
He could die. 

13:35.570 --> 13:37.780
I'm trying to make sure he gets sent to the hospital this time. 

13:38.220 --> 13:41.160
Hurry. Hurry. 

13:43.070 --> 13:46.840
If we take out the ones in jail right now... 

13:46.840 --> 13:49.110
I'm going to take this. 

13:53.460 --> 13:55.790
Detective Baek! Detective Baek! 

14:04.470 --> 14:05.840
Dinner? 

14:08.470 --> 14:09.700
It's weird. 

14:11.050 --> 14:12.920
On the day of that dinner... 

14:12.920 --> 14:14.770
There were no card transactions. 

14:15.410 --> 14:17.660
He was home all day. 

14:29.260 --> 14:30.820
Yes, Min Ho. 

14:30.820 --> 14:31.830
Yeh Ri. 

14:31.830 --> 14:35.640
I think there was a burglary on the night Hwang Sung Min was murdered. 

14:35.640 --> 14:37.750
Can you check if anything is missing? 

14:42.710 --> 14:44.630
Phone, PDA. 

14:44.630 --> 14:48.400
And looking at this card details, I think his camera and jewelry is missing too. 

14:49.090 --> 14:51.640
That's it for now. 

14:51.640 --> 14:53.840
Okay. Let me know if you find anything else. 

14:54.510 --> 14:55.210
Bye~ 

14:56.320 --> 14:57.210
Okay. 

15:04.890 --> 15:05.950
What else is missing? 

15:08.500 --> 15:09.530
What else... is missing? 

15:19.620 --> 15:20.640
Bed cover! 

15:40.020 --> 15:43.100
There's no filter. 

15:46.240 --> 15:47.880
He erased his tracks. 

15:49.430 --> 15:50.910
Cleanly... 

15:56.380 --> 15:58.450
There's a new infected person. 

16:06.590 --> 16:11.170
8 infected people were found at Shin Jung Dong apartment complex and the surrounding area. 

16:11.170 --> 16:15.230
There were no relations between the subjects. 

16:15.900 --> 16:19.280
Seeing how the infected people are from different residences... 

16:19.280 --> 16:22.480
It's likely that the suspect has spread the virus himself. 

16:30.320 --> 16:31.400
Yes? 

16:31.400 --> 16:32.470
Director Yeo! 

16:33.280 --> 16:35.850
The burglar was at the crime scene. 

16:35.850 --> 16:37.660
I'm looking through a list right now. 

16:38.250 --> 16:40.160
Even with filtering,
there's still 15 people. 

16:41.170 --> 16:44.250
Is there anyone from Shin Jung Don? 

16:44.250 --> 16:45.900
Shin Jun Don... Shin Jun Don... 

16:47.240 --> 16:48.910
I don't see any... 

16:48.910 --> 16:51.010
I'll send you the list. 

16:51.010 --> 16:53.760
Run some background checks. 

16:54.590 --> 16:55.350
Okay. 

17:02.350 --> 17:03.350
Director. 

17:03.350 --> 17:06.810
Here's the list of burglars from Detective Baek. 

17:07.880 --> 17:08.650
Thanks. 

17:23.420 --> 17:25.210
The suspect is a delivery man. 

17:27.770 --> 17:28.900
Why? 

17:28.900 --> 17:30.600
Housewives... children... 

17:31.330 --> 17:33.290
The only types of people home during the day. 

17:33.990 --> 17:35.510
Security guards too. 

17:36.980 --> 17:39.340
Looking at the break in case... 

17:39.340 --> 17:40.760
There was a delivery package. 

17:42.230 --> 17:43.190
Jang Suk Bum. 

17:46.510 --> 17:47.690
Let's get ready. 

17:54.380 --> 17:55.510
Senior. 

17:55.510 --> 17:59.540
The delivery company said that Jang Suk Bum didn't show up today. 

18:20.080 --> 18:21.060
He's not here? 

18:28.260 --> 18:29.560
Save me... 

18:36.220 --> 18:37.990
Bring in the ambulance! 

20:35.770 --> 20:37.330
Hospital food must be good. 

20:37.330 --> 20:38.670
You're better already! 

20:39.500 --> 20:40.380
Who are you? 

20:41.180 --> 20:42.010
Me? 

20:43.000 --> 20:45.410
Your savior. Police. 

20:47.630 --> 20:50.400
I didn't kill that man! 

20:50.400 --> 20:52.340
It wasn't me! 

20:52.340 --> 20:53.710
I know that. 

20:53.710 --> 20:55.260
You guys don't kill people. 

20:55.260 --> 20:56.430
That's a cardinal rule. 

20:56.430 --> 20:57.880
That's what I'm saying! 

20:57.880 --> 21:00.900
I've been doing this for how long! 

21:00.900 --> 21:03.030
I watched him for a month. 

21:03.030 --> 21:06.400
I can tell if the house is occupied or vacant just by looking at the meter. 

21:06.400 --> 21:07.380
But... 

21:08.560 --> 21:10.470
You guys make mistakes too. 

21:11.250 --> 21:13.680
When you see someone you weren't expecting... 

21:14.580 --> 21:16.060
You say "Oh!" 

21:16.060 --> 21:17.120
Those things happen. Right? 

21:18.920 --> 21:21.500
I'm telling you that the owner wasn't home that day! 

21:21.500 --> 21:23.780
Every Saturday, I only clear out houses that are empty! 

21:23.780 --> 21:26.070
You know we only rob with impact! 

21:27.980 --> 21:28.760
So... 

21:29.460 --> 21:30.690
What time did you go in? 

21:32.320 --> 21:36.080
After the neighbor left for work... 

21:36.750 --> 21:40.820
Around 11:10... I went in. 

21:41.380 --> 21:43.120
Something felt weird. 

21:43.120 --> 21:45.120
I turned on the lamp immediately. 

21:45.120 --> 21:47.990
A man in his underwear was on the floor dead. 

21:47.990 --> 21:50.740
But I saw his face and saw that it was the owner. 

21:50.740 --> 21:52.290
How did you know it was the owner? 

21:53.860 --> 21:58.400
I watched him for a month! I told you! 

21:59.170 --> 22:00.400
And then what? 

22:00.400 --> 22:02.400
What do you mean? 

22:02.400 --> 22:05.520
I saw a dead body and got so scared I ran out. 

22:06.340 --> 22:08.580
While you were watching him for a month... 

22:08.580 --> 22:10.550
Was there anything weird about the owner? 

22:16.010 --> 22:16.880
Ah. 

22:17.900 --> 22:19.620
A woman would occasionally be there. 

22:20.320 --> 22:21.620
Only on Fridays. 

22:22.420 --> 22:23.130
Woman? 

22:24.930 --> 22:27.640
If a woman comes in and out that fast... 

22:27.640 --> 22:29.030
You know what they're doing. 

22:32.950 --> 22:34.540
Do you remember her face? 

22:35.070 --> 22:37.520
Of course! Hyung! 

22:38.020 --> 22:41.380
My nickname is Living Scanner. 

22:45.140 --> 22:50.550
If you're lying to me right now, you're dead. 

22:51.290 --> 22:52.260
Hyung. 

22:52.940 --> 22:58.150
A pro like you would know if I was lying or not. 

22:59.480 --> 23:00.560
And! 

23:00.560 --> 23:04.560
I don't respect just anybody. 

23:06.610 --> 23:10.740
Fine. Get better, you punk. 

23:11.900 --> 23:12.740
Yes. 

23:22.180 --> 23:22.810
Yeah? 

23:22.810 --> 23:25.950
There were large amounts of Yohimbine found in his body. 

23:25.950 --> 23:29.190
With this amount, it would've been hard for him to keep balance. 

23:29.750 --> 23:33.100
Yohimbine? Aphrodisiac? 

23:33.700 --> 23:35.700
It looks like he was planning a private party. 

23:36.870 --> 23:39.010
Private party... 

23:44.120 --> 23:48.260
The night Hwang Sung Min died,
he had a visitor. 

23:49.300 --> 23:51.100
He prepared an aphrodisiac. 

23:51.100 --> 23:53.530
Looking at the sexual orientations of the victims... 

23:54.500 --> 23:58.600
It's likely that females attended these private parties. 

24:00.840 --> 24:04.710
Here's video footage from the elevator he took for the past few months. 

24:04.710 --> 24:05.870
Even though her face is covered... 

24:05.870 --> 24:07.630
It's the same person. 

24:07.630 --> 24:10.220
Like Jang Suk Bum said,
this was taken on a Friday night. 

24:10.220 --> 24:12.430
Have you confirmed Jang Suk Bum's statement? 

24:12.430 --> 24:13.390
Yes. 

24:13.390 --> 24:17.140
We confirmed his statements and his alibi after the case as well. 

24:17.140 --> 24:19.520
Looking at Hwang Sung Min's dinner schedule... 

24:19.520 --> 24:22.710
It looks like it was a code name for a secret meeting between the two of them. 

24:23.450 --> 24:25.210
But why is it on a Saturday this time? 

24:25.910 --> 24:27.840
His dinners are usually scheduled on Fridays. 

24:29.510 --> 24:31.920
The day before the accident... 

24:31.920 --> 24:34.470
The dinner was scheduled for a Friday like usual. 

24:35.860 --> 24:37.130
Who knows... 

24:37.130 --> 24:39.130
Maybe something happened between them. 

24:40.550 --> 24:42.370
That's why the murder happened. 

24:43.000 --> 24:46.440
The private dinner turned into their last dinner. 

24:47.870 --> 24:51.130
It started off good, then we don't know what happened... 

24:51.660 --> 24:54.010
She seems like a woman who is hiding a lot. 

24:54.010 --> 24:56.160
I don't think she's just hiding her face. 

24:56.160 --> 24:59.990
I couldn't find Hwang Sung Min's call history anywhere in his house. 

25:00.740 --> 25:03.290
There's a reason why her identity can't be revealed. 

25:04.310 --> 25:06.000
How do we find this woman? 

25:06.560 --> 25:09.920
I know one place. 

25:11.370 --> 25:12.450
S Bar. 

25:13.140 --> 25:15.150
It's a place where you meet sex partners. 

25:15.840 --> 25:17.570
We might not need to find her. 

25:20.320 --> 25:21.750
It's been 48 hours now. 

25:23.810 --> 25:26.250
She'll show herself soon. 

25:27.310 --> 25:28.970
Her hiding period is coming to an end. 

25:32.720 --> 25:36.090
Incubation 

25:42.060 --> 25:44.920
The infection has been stopped on Jang Suk Bum's side. 

25:45.480 --> 25:46.490
Thank goodness. 

25:47.430 --> 25:49.730
But, if a new suspect emerges... 

25:49.730 --> 25:52.140
There should be a new infection route. 

25:52.140 --> 25:53.990
Why is this one so silent? 

25:53.990 --> 25:55.890
It might be crouched. 

25:55.890 --> 25:57.380
Until it can't hold itself anymore. 

25:59.370 --> 26:03.370
Have you found the items that the burglar stole? 

26:07.000 --> 26:07.750
No. 

26:24.540 --> 26:26.720
How did he bring this in?

26:27.830 --> 26:29.290
Impressive. 

26:31.230 --> 26:33.720
There's no phone or PDA. 

27:15.120 --> 27:18.310
Hwang Sung Min was kicked out a year ago. 

27:19.690 --> 27:25.060
A year ago, there was an incident where one of our female clients almost died. 

27:25.060 --> 27:28.090
He chocked her and almost broke her neck. 

27:28.090 --> 27:32.460
This side of the world is as dangerous as it is exciting. 

27:34.470 --> 27:39.370
But, Hwang Sung Min's sadistic tendencies were beyond anything else. 

27:40.460 --> 27:44.500
I need a list of all the women he's been involved with. 

27:45.300 --> 27:47.050
Okay. I'll give that over. 

27:48.090 --> 27:49.650
You're giving it away much easier than I thought. 

27:50.840 --> 27:53.070
I'm not a secretive person. 

27:53.070 --> 27:57.830
This is just a place for people with the same sexual habits to gather for pleasure. 

27:57.830 --> 27:59.900
That's all. 

28:02.000 --> 28:05.610
Would you know this woman's face? 

28:08.090 --> 28:09.960
This is my first time seeing her face. 

28:10.610 --> 28:12.380
She's not a member here. 

28:16.800 --> 28:18.250
You're a pharmacist. 

28:18.250 --> 28:21.210
Yes. Is there a problem? 

28:24.560 --> 28:27.550
Have you ever met Hwang Sung Min? 

28:28.000 --> 28:30.230
I haven't seen him since he got kicked out. 

28:31.070 --> 28:33.660
But we did really hit it off back then. 

28:35.100 --> 28:37.330
Looks like you've gotten used to playing the slave. 

28:37.330 --> 28:39.670
I hear Hwang Sung Min is aggressive. 

28:40.400 --> 28:41.920
You're not familiar with this but... 

28:41.920 --> 28:46.020
The slave is the one with total control. 

28:46.820 --> 28:49.850
The moment the slave says stop,
everything stops. 

28:52.490 --> 28:54.530
You're risking your life. 

28:54.530 --> 28:56.220
That's the thrill. 

29:00.560 --> 29:03.010
I believe she's Hwang Sung Min's new partner. 

29:06.320 --> 29:08.020
Do you know this woman? 

29:08.020 --> 29:10.460
His tastes have changed. 

29:10.460 --> 29:12.150
I've never seen her. 

29:16.300 --> 29:17.850
Thank you for your cooperation. 

29:19.430 --> 29:23.800
Over here, we're all strong and in control of ourselves. 

29:23.800 --> 29:24.960
Like you, Detective. 

29:28.980 --> 29:30.360
You do know something. 

29:36.280 --> 29:37.840
Is she really coming here? 

29:38.270 --> 29:40.960
Even if she's living in the dumps,
it's better than living in hell. 

29:40.960 --> 29:43.040
If she's alive, she'll be here. 

29:43.040 --> 29:45.360
Where else would she go? 

29:58.940 --> 30:01.430
I heard Director Yeo visits Song Kyung Tae often. 

30:03.870 --> 30:04.660
Yes. 

30:05.790 --> 30:07.880
It seems like he visits often. 

30:07.880 --> 30:10.330
But I have no idea why. 

30:10.330 --> 30:11.790
Any other secrets? 

30:12.880 --> 30:13.790
What? 

30:14.870 --> 30:15.800
Nothing. 

30:17.310 --> 30:18.550
Nothing. 

30:19.550 --> 30:20.640
Hyung! 

30:20.640 --> 30:23.730
You haven't found her yet? 

30:23.730 --> 30:26.090
Would you be able to find her if you were me? 

30:26.900 --> 30:28.690
She looks completely normal... 

30:28.690 --> 30:30.300
But she's quite mean. 

30:30.300 --> 30:32.670
She totally smashed his head with a golf club. 

30:33.720 --> 30:35.840
Wow, what a mean woman. 

30:35.840 --> 30:36.780
Good luck! 

30:36.780 --> 30:37.840
Hey! 

30:38.800 --> 30:39.510
Yes? 

30:40.230 --> 30:41.130
Golf club? 

30:42.240 --> 30:42.990
Yes. 

30:45.200 --> 30:46.590
How'd you know that? 

30:52.250 --> 30:53.170
Here. 

30:53.910 --> 30:56.600
There was a golf club next to the body. 

30:56.600 --> 30:58.730
Putter! Covered with blood. 

31:01.450 --> 31:02.440
Are you sure? 

31:03.270 --> 31:04.440
Hyung. 

31:04.440 --> 31:06.350
I'm the Kim Bo Sung of my field. 

31:06.350 --> 31:08.620
Loyal! 

31:10.140 --> 31:13.160
I never betray anyone that trusts in me. 

31:14.120 --> 31:17.540
My instincts have been right for 20 years. 

31:17.540 --> 31:18.970
I'm never wrong! 

31:19.620 --> 31:20.810
You didn't see the knife? 

31:22.400 --> 31:24.210
I didn't see that. 

31:24.770 --> 31:26.750
Okay. Fine. 

31:28.140 --> 31:31.340
Find what's different from what you saw. 

31:32.310 --> 31:33.340
Yes, Hyung. 

31:44.350 --> 31:45.840
Bed cover. 

31:45.840 --> 31:48.780
There were bed sheets here.
Blue plaid sheets. 

31:51.120 --> 31:54.290
You said you left right at 11:10, right? 

31:54.290 --> 31:55.130
Yes. 

31:58.270 --> 31:59.330
Okay. 

32:00.370 --> 32:01.120
Hey. 

32:03.350 --> 32:05.280
Hyung, I'll be going. 

32:05.280 --> 32:06.050
Loyal! 

32:08.590 --> 32:09.520
So... 

32:10.360 --> 32:15.450
After Jang Suk Bum left and before the CDC came... 

32:16.600 --> 32:18.820
The criminal came back to clean the crime scene? 

32:21.170 --> 32:24.360
Why would he do something so complicated and dangerous? 

32:25.150 --> 32:27.200
He could've cleaned up right after he killed him. 

32:27.200 --> 32:28.550
That's true. 

32:57.490 --> 33:00.090
Detective Baek. Over here... 

33:00.770 --> 33:01.800
It's her. 

33:20.510 --> 33:22.300
You finally showed up. 

33:25.000 --> 33:25.990
Lee Ji Soo. 

33:29.260 --> 33:32.850
People look innocent but you never know. 

33:32.850 --> 33:36.100
What they're thinking... always in a daze. 

33:44.780 --> 33:47.380
Her husband gave her a hard time. 

33:47.380 --> 33:51.290
They used to be rich but her husband lost all of their money. 

33:51.920 --> 33:56.270
I think he's working as a taxi driver now. 

33:56.270 --> 33:57.670
That poor woman. 

33:59.480 --> 34:03.680
How was their relationship? 

34:04.500 --> 34:08.699
I heard that they grew up in the same town and fell in love. 

34:08.699 --> 34:10.980
Her husband was very good to her. 

34:10.980 --> 34:15.100
When she ended work late,
he would always wait for her. 

34:19.159 --> 34:22.880
Lee Ji Soo and Hwang Sung Min had a senior-junior relationship in college. 

34:23.560 --> 34:26.380
Their relationship started a year ago. 

34:27.010 --> 34:30.889
She suffered economically because of her husband's failing business. 

34:30.889 --> 34:33.780
It was around the time that the private dinner was first scheduled. 

34:36.739 --> 34:38.989
She cheated on her husband for a year. 

34:41.710 --> 34:43.170
What an impressive woman. 

34:45.710 --> 34:47.139
But... 

34:47.139 --> 34:50.400
We still haven't found a reason for why she would murder Hwang Sung Min. 

35:01.180 --> 35:02.290
We're finished. 

35:09.750 --> 35:11.820
Min Ho. Go in. 

35:12.590 --> 35:15.760
Lee Ji Soo is the prime suspect of the murder incident. 

35:16.570 --> 35:18.560
We ask for your cooperation with this investigation. 

35:22.770 --> 35:25.790
Last Saturday, between 8-12... 

35:25.790 --> 35:28.440
Where was your wife? 

35:28.440 --> 35:29.180
I'm not sure. 

35:29.180 --> 35:30.950
Since I was working... 

35:31.530 --> 35:32.950
She was probably at home. 

35:35.660 --> 35:38.390
Has there been anything suspicious about her lately? 

35:38.970 --> 35:41.040
Perhaps was she hiding something? 

35:41.040 --> 35:43.140
Or going out for no reason? 

35:43.140 --> 35:44.640
Anything weird? 

35:45.420 --> 35:47.380
No, nothing like that. 

35:48.580 --> 35:51.550
Kim Joo Chul's test results are positive. 

35:52.510 --> 35:55.640
We need to head to the hospital first. 

35:58.160 --> 35:59.590
Hold tight for now. 

36:00.370 --> 36:01.120
Hey! 

36:01.880 --> 36:03.050
Escort him. 

36:12.750 --> 36:14.390
Did you find it?
The golf club? 

36:14.990 --> 36:17.870
There wasn't any murder weapons or anything... 

36:17.870 --> 36:20.320
That woman really is something. 

36:20.900 --> 36:23.190
You really don't know with women. 

36:28.490 --> 36:30.780
Her husband must be more shocked than we are. 

36:49.580 --> 36:50.630
Min Ho. 

36:52.120 --> 36:54.850
Let's do some digging on Kim Joo Chul. 

36:54.850 --> 36:55.990
Why him? 

37:01.980 --> 37:05.920
June 1st, "Na", "Da" is when he works. 

37:05.920 --> 37:07.770
"Ga" means he can't work. 

37:10.910 --> 37:16.000
Kim Joo Chul is lying to us. 

37:20.670 --> 37:22.410
This is totally the opposite! 

37:23.010 --> 37:25.100
According to Kim Joo Chul's taxi GPS... 

37:25.100 --> 37:30.310
He was at Hwang Sung Min's house that night between 9:00-10:10 PM. 

37:30.310 --> 37:34.440
So he knew about the affair? 

37:34.440 --> 37:37.390
Furthermore, the next day from 2:20-3:15 AM... 

37:37.390 --> 37:41.970
In about 40 minutes,
he was at the crime scene again. 

37:41.970 --> 37:45.120
Like Jang Suk Bum said, he went back. 

37:46.440 --> 37:48.480
From motive to the context... 

37:48.480 --> 37:50.060
We have all the answers. 

37:51.540 --> 37:54.080
Affair, passion, murder. 

37:56.690 --> 37:58.120
This is a soap opera. 

37:59.250 --> 38:01.620
I have my doubts on Lee Ji Soo. 

38:02.350 --> 38:03.450
If she was an honorable person... 

38:03.450 --> 38:06.660
She would've gone to the hospital as soon as she saw signs of infection. 

38:07.280 --> 38:09.700
But, she didn't and she kept it in. 

38:09.700 --> 38:11.460
She must be hiding something. 

38:12.610 --> 38:14.860
According to the signs of infection... 

38:14.860 --> 38:17.710
It wasn't Kim Joo Chul to Lee Ji Soo. 

38:18.520 --> 38:21.120
But Lee Ji Soo to Kim Joo Chul. 

38:23.490 --> 38:26.700
We don't know the ending to this soap opera. 

38:27.600 --> 38:29.290
We need to call them both in. 

38:29.290 --> 38:31.530
This case is starting to flow in a strange direction. 

38:33.210 --> 38:36.640
Change 

38:42.030 --> 38:45.260
Your alibi for Saturday night was a lie. 

38:47.390 --> 38:53.340
From 9:00-10:10 PM, you were near Hwang Sung Min's apartment complex. 

38:53.340 --> 38:54.900
There were no records of business that night. 

38:57.940 --> 38:59.330
Why did you go there? 

39:01.600 --> 39:03.600
Were you following your wife? 

39:04.540 --> 39:05.920
On her way to meet Hwang Sung Min. 

39:09.890 --> 39:11.900
You stayed for more than an hour. 

39:12.870 --> 39:13.890
What were you doing? 

39:16.780 --> 39:19.190
It's true that I was around the area. 

39:19.190 --> 39:22.280
I couldn't believe that my wife was having an affair. 

39:22.280 --> 39:26.570
So, I wanted to see it for myself. 

39:26.570 --> 39:28.640
I didn't know what to do. 

39:29.370 --> 39:30.320
That's why... 

39:30.320 --> 39:31.780
You just went home? 

39:32.960 --> 39:34.500
That's hard to believe. 

39:38.620 --> 39:42.820
Are you married by any chance? 

39:43.670 --> 39:44.570
No. 

39:45.460 --> 39:52.400
The moment I saw that my wife was with a better man, I was no longer her husband. 

39:53.840 --> 39:55.400
There was nothing I could do for her. 

39:56.760 --> 40:00.730
That feeling of turning away and pretending like you don't know. 

40:02.350 --> 40:03.720
You wouldn't understand. 

40:05.170 --> 40:06.720
If you were feeling that way... 

40:07.550 --> 40:10.780
Why did you go back? At dawn? 

40:18.460 --> 40:20.250
You murdered Hwang Sung Min, didn't you? 

40:21.340 --> 40:22.740
With a golf putter. 

40:24.080 --> 40:26.290
No. I didn't kill him. 

40:27.720 --> 40:28.930
Honestly. 

40:42.940 --> 40:45.430
Your condition got better. 

40:46.570 --> 40:48.510
How did you end up infected? 

40:49.870 --> 40:51.940
The virus is spreading like crazy. 

40:51.940 --> 40:53.640
Do I really need a reason? 

40:55.670 --> 40:59.060
Who you got infected from and who you spread it to... 

40:59.790 --> 41:03.540
Sometimes your hidden secrets are revealed whether you like it or not. 

41:06.480 --> 41:08.160
You know Hwang Sung Min, right? 

41:10.510 --> 41:12.430
What's your relationship with him? 

41:13.620 --> 41:16.810
We're just colleagues. 

41:18.350 --> 41:21.330
You go to his house often. 

41:23.510 --> 41:24.750
Every Friday night. 

41:30.490 --> 41:34.580
What were you doing last Saturday night around 9:00? 

41:36.690 --> 41:40.670
I didn't feel well so I went home after work. 

41:42.940 --> 41:45.680
Is there anyone that can confirm your alibi? 

41:46.200 --> 41:49.160
For example, your husband? 

41:51.290 --> 41:53.530
I think he was home. 

41:55.600 --> 41:59.060
But I went to the other room so... 

41:59.930 --> 42:01.200
How strange. 

42:02.930 --> 42:07.150
Your husband was near Hwang Sung Min's apartment during those hours. 

42:09.060 --> 42:09.940
What? 

42:11.140 --> 42:15.410
Your husband was chasing you but you're saying you weren't there. 

42:18.100 --> 42:19.620
Who's telling the truth? 

42:21.200 --> 42:24.160
You went to Hwang Sung Min's house that night, didn't you? 

42:26.000 --> 42:29.480
But this time not for dinner, for murder! 

42:31.640 --> 42:35.070
No. I didn't kill him. 

42:42.880 --> 42:44.340
Is it just me? 

42:45.340 --> 42:47.600
They both say they didn't kill him but... 

42:48.310 --> 42:50.370
They both look like they did. 

42:53.080 --> 42:55.770
Are they accomplices? 

42:57.220 --> 42:58.730
Or not? 

42:59.260 --> 43:03.870
Working with your cheating wife and killing that man just doesn't make sense. 

43:03.870 --> 43:06.100
Kim Joo Chul is definitely lying. 

43:06.710 --> 43:12.230
But, there's no physical evidence that he committed the crime. 

43:13.130 --> 43:14.790
Same goes for Lee Ji Soo. 

43:14.790 --> 43:16.460
Her motive is unclear. 

43:17.010 --> 43:20.470
Killing Hwang Sung Min at the end of their affair... 

43:20.470 --> 43:22.870
Who is it then? 

43:27.000 --> 43:28.820
You should come here for a minute. 

43:33.190 --> 43:35.450
Kim Joo Chul is the host of the antibodies?! 

43:35.450 --> 43:38.290
His recent test results were positive. 

43:38.630 --> 43:43.500
They both came out as positive. 

43:43.500 --> 43:46.700
The second PCR test takes a little more time. 

43:46.700 --> 43:50.990
We need to give vaccines to those patients who tested positive first. 

43:51.790 --> 43:55.460
Kim Joo Chul carries the antibodies. 

43:56.130 --> 43:57.670
And one more thing. 

43:57.670 --> 44:01.010
Lee Ji Soo has not had contact with any infectious agents. 

44:01.010 --> 44:03.980
And she has not spread the infection to anyone else. 

44:03.980 --> 44:05.860
If Kim Joo Chul had the antibodies... 

44:05.860 --> 44:08.720
It would've been impossible for him to spread it to her in the first place. 

44:10.040 --> 44:13.840
The only way to infect her is through Hwang Sung Min. 

44:14.490 --> 44:20.070
Then, Lee Ji Soo saying that she didn't go to Hwang Sung Min's house is a lie. 

44:21.200 --> 44:23.540
One side is getting more and more suspicious. 

44:25.180 --> 44:27.210
Looking at your phone tracker... 

44:27.210 --> 44:29.290
You've been home ever since Saturday. 

44:30.070 --> 44:32.000
According to the results of the epidemiological study... 

44:32.570 --> 44:34.710
There's only 2 people who could've infected you. 

44:36.100 --> 44:38.230
Your husband, Kim Joo Chul and Hwang Sung Min. 

44:43.450 --> 44:47.240
Your husband has the antibodies. 

44:48.630 --> 44:53.720
The night Hwang Sung Min died,
you became infected by him. 

45:00.980 --> 45:02.720
You murdered Hwang Sung Min, didn't you? 

45:10.830 --> 45:12.550
I did wrong. 

45:16.080 --> 45:17.780
I killed him. 

45:23.870 --> 45:25.940
In the bedroom... 

45:25.940 --> 45:27.990
With a knife I already had prepared... 

45:28.740 --> 45:31.010
I stabbed him in the stomach. 

45:31.800 --> 45:32.890
And then... 

45:33.950 --> 45:39.770
I killed him with a golf club in the living room. 

45:40.760 --> 45:43.020
Where and how many times did you hit him? 

45:45.730 --> 45:47.010
Head... 

45:50.870 --> 45:52.140
7 times. 

45:56.310 --> 45:57.850
What was the motive? 

45:58.640 --> 45:59.760
Why did you kill him? 

46:03.260 --> 46:04.800
I already confessed. 

46:05.940 --> 46:07.950
Do I really have to give you a reason? 

46:23.630 --> 46:26.090
Just a few moments ago Lee Ji Soo confessed to the crime. 

46:26.090 --> 46:27.030
Wait. 

46:29.710 --> 46:31.260
I have something to say. 

46:39.100 --> 46:40.280
Director Yeo. 

46:43.030 --> 46:48.530
Kim Joo Chul is saying that he killed Hwang Sung Min. 

46:50.390 --> 46:51.460
What?! 

47:00.500 --> 47:02.350
Why did you kill Hwang Sung Min? 

47:03.590 --> 47:05.870
Do I really have to say why? 

47:06.960 --> 47:09.140
He was cheating with my wife. 

47:10.630 --> 47:12.680
I wanted to kill him more. 

47:12.680 --> 47:14.610
Then... 

47:16.110 --> 47:17.530
Why not your wife? 

47:17.530 --> 47:22.620
You murdered him and lived with your cheating wife for 2 days acting like nothing happened. 

47:24.900 --> 47:27.030
How did you kill him? 

47:27.740 --> 47:30.000
At first, I stabbed him. 

47:30.000 --> 47:34.070
Then, I used a golf club. 

47:34.070 --> 47:36.230
Tell me exactly where you stabbed him. 

47:36.230 --> 47:38.040
And how many times you hit him. 

47:41.620 --> 47:43.270
I was too worked up at the time. 

47:44.210 --> 47:45.850
I don't remember. 

47:48.430 --> 47:49.600
After you committed the crime... 

47:49.600 --> 47:51.350
Why did you go back to the site? 

47:52.170 --> 47:54.140
I was out of my mind on my way home. 

47:54.990 --> 47:56.370
I got scared. 

47:57.070 --> 48:01.790
That's why I went back to clean up. 

48:02.920 --> 48:07.460
I threw the weapon away in the Han River. 

48:12.160 --> 48:13.400
Nam Yeh Ri. 

48:15.180 --> 48:18.300
You said Lee Ji Soo had many jobs, right? 

48:19.510 --> 48:20.300
Yes. 

48:23.690 --> 48:27.660
A woman like that cheats... 

48:30.120 --> 48:31.650
It's kind of strange. 

48:35.090 --> 48:36.830
The NFS results are out. 

48:36.830 --> 48:40.650
The fingerprints on the golf putter are Kim Joo Chul's. 

48:41.740 --> 48:45.350
One side is infection,
the other is murder. 

48:46.820 --> 48:48.770
We're back to the beginning of this investigation. 

48:48.770 --> 48:51.600
This is really strange. 

48:51.600 --> 48:56.020
They're both confessing to the murder. 

48:56.960 --> 48:59.260
It's hard to tell who the real criminal is. 

49:00.060 --> 49:01.260
Why? 

49:01.260 --> 49:03.260
One plus one equals zero. 

49:05.120 --> 49:07.450
Both of them being suspected... 

49:07.450 --> 49:10.360
Is the same as nobody being suspected. 

49:10.360 --> 49:15.820
Maybe because of guilt,
the wife is protecting her husband? 

49:15.820 --> 49:18.450
The husband is protecting the wife? 

49:18.450 --> 49:22.620
Who would protect a cheating wife? 

49:23.880 --> 49:27.270
I saw some finance records. 

49:27.270 --> 49:30.430
About a year ago,
$150 million was withdrawn. 

49:30.430 --> 49:35.500
On the same day, Kim Joo Chul was cleared from his debt of the same amount. 

49:35.500 --> 49:39.630
If it wasn't for this money,
Kim Joo Chul would've been in prison for fraud. 

49:41.380 --> 49:43.490
Were there any bank records at the scene? 

49:44.420 --> 49:45.330
No. 

49:46.340 --> 49:52.120
Because of the money,
the couple played some serious Go Stop? 

49:52.120 --> 49:54.310
They killed together. 

49:54.310 --> 49:55.830
Split the doubt. 

49:56.760 --> 50:01.040
This isn't a soap opera, it's a scam. 

50:01.040 --> 50:05.370
There's definitely a mask to that innocent looking face. 

50:05.960 --> 50:09.780
How do we confirm the criminal? 

50:11.320 --> 50:13.420
Getting a real confession will be hard. 

50:13.420 --> 50:15.560
All the evidence is gone. 

50:15.560 --> 50:16.540
No. 

50:17.490 --> 50:20.560
Before the CDC came,
there were some items left. 

50:23.790 --> 50:25.410
The stuff Jang Suk Bum stole! 

50:26.230 --> 50:27.260
The bed sheets! 

50:27.630 --> 50:29.460
And the murder weapon! 

50:30.150 --> 50:31.770
There's another one. 

50:31.770 --> 50:35.360
Hwang Sung Min's phone and PDA. 

50:35.360 --> 50:37.160
Uncontaminated evidence... 

50:38.900 --> 50:40.340
We should find those first. 

50:52.510 --> 50:54.770
You said you wanted to be friends. 

50:55.770 --> 50:56.470
Yes. 

50:56.950 --> 50:59.870
Is there anything else you stole? 

51:04.190 --> 51:05.120
PDA. 

51:07.300 --> 51:10.570
I needed to keep something for my months worth of work! 

51:10.570 --> 51:14.150
I gave it over to the woman at the CDC. 

51:14.150 --> 51:17.450
The PDA had germs all over it but they still took it. 

51:17.450 --> 51:18.820
CDC? 

51:18.820 --> 51:19.710
Yes. 

51:20.260 --> 51:21.410
What about the phone? 

51:21.410 --> 51:24.170
Who cares about the phone? It's so cheap. 

51:27.450 --> 51:28.430
Hyung. 

51:29.390 --> 51:31.800
If I get caught, I'll be in jail for a long time. 

51:31.800 --> 51:33.620
Take care of me, okay? 

51:34.380 --> 51:35.620
Okay. 

51:35.620 --> 51:40.180
I'll put in a good word depending on how you do. 

51:46.010 --> 51:50.260
I took this out before I handed it in. 

51:50.940 --> 51:51.930
What do you think? 

52:02.160 --> 52:04.030
Don't ever study. 

52:04.400 --> 52:06.260
Just live in your thoughts. 

52:06.260 --> 52:07.810
Yes, sir! 

52:11.750 --> 52:12.800
Thank you! 

52:17.770 --> 52:18.680
Director. 

52:18.680 --> 52:20.680
Looking through Lee Ji Soo's email... 

52:20.680 --> 52:23.060
There were some emails sent from Hwang Sung Min's phone. 

52:23.580 --> 52:25.730
The email history is confirmed but... 

52:25.730 --> 52:28.120
The server got deleted so I couldn't recover anything. 

52:29.340 --> 52:32.010
What in the world did they want to hide so bad? 

52:38.200 --> 52:39.290
Yes? 

52:39.290 --> 52:40.260
Director Yeo! 

52:40.890 --> 52:42.960
I just found something interesting. 

52:43.500 --> 52:45.870
That CDC woman, Yoon Seo Hyun? 

52:46.900 --> 52:48.510
She's quite a character. 

54:32.570 --> 54:33.810
Good work. 

54:40.670 --> 54:42.480
Advanced Information from the Analysts. 

54:46.170 --> 54:48.770
It's a ranking of the stock value of major companies. 

54:48.770 --> 54:50.040
Multi billion dollars worth. 

54:51.930 --> 54:54.240
What was the cost to get this? 

54:55.680 --> 55:01.510
I should've looked into this back when the burglar had stolen goods. 

55:04.060 --> 55:08.090
The phone that the burglar saw in Hwang Sung Min's house has disappeared. 

55:08.090 --> 55:10.980
If Kim Joo Chul didn't take it,
it would be you. 

55:16.020 --> 55:17.820
I think it was you. 

55:19.780 --> 55:21.300
The evidence is you. 

55:23.790 --> 55:25.070
Where is the phone? 

55:49.220 --> 55:50.370
Well... 

55:51.270 --> 55:56.370
The phone has been recovered to its original state. 

55:59.320 --> 56:01.190
But I think you should see something. 

56:40.230 --> 56:42.240
I can't breathe. 

56:47.570 --> 56:49.660
Enough... Please... Stop. 

56:58.860 --> 57:00.420
She didn't have an affair. 

57:01.070 --> 57:03.010
She really was a slave. 

57:03.980 --> 57:06.100
Who could be used at any time. 

57:06.100 --> 57:11.690
From the time that money was withdrawn from Hwang Sung Min's account... 

57:13.080 --> 57:14.690
That's when it started. 

57:16.680 --> 57:19.530
It matches with the dinner appointment he had on his schedule. 

57:20.600 --> 57:26.310
She really became a slave trying to save her husband. 

57:27.060 --> 57:28.290
The day before the crime... 

57:29.880 --> 57:31.860
She was supposed to come for the Friday dinner appointment. 

57:33.420 --> 57:37.440
Hwang Sung Min emailed her the video he had on his phone. 

57:40.190 --> 57:41.430
This one too. 

57:45.230 --> 57:48.470
On the night of the dinner, he threatened her when she didn't respond. 

57:49.430 --> 57:51.200
That he would tell her husband. 

57:53.100 --> 57:56.420
That became Lee Ji Soo's motive. 

57:57.330 --> 57:59.600
That could've been Kim Joo Chul's motive too. 

58:00.660 --> 58:03.380
If he knew about all of this... 

58:22.980 --> 58:27.450
We knew that you suffered to save your husband. 

58:28.380 --> 58:32.280
And that it was hard for you to leave Hwang Sung Min. 

58:37.630 --> 58:39.250
Why didn't you say anything? 

58:40.850 --> 58:42.040
If you had... 

58:42.790 --> 58:44.810
This would've passed as an extenuating circumstance. 

58:46.210 --> 58:48.010
The penalty would've been less severe too. 

58:58.020 --> 58:59.150
No. 

59:01.290 --> 59:02.890
It was that way at first. 

59:05.680 --> 59:09.180
But I started to like it more and more. 

59:10.850 --> 59:12.220
You know. 

59:12.980 --> 59:14.640
That I enjoyed the dinners. 

59:39.960 --> 59:41.300
Your wife... 

59:42.870 --> 59:44.960
...didn't cheat on you. 

59:53.220 --> 59:56.470
A year ago, when you almost went to jail... 

59:56.470 --> 59:58.340
Hwang Sung Min helped you out. 

59:58.340 --> 59:59.630
Did you know? 

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.240
What? Hwang Sung Min? 

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.180
In turn, your wife was sacrificed. 

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.400
Sacrificed? 

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:25.430
Kim Joo Chul doesn't know about the video. 

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.360
He's doubting his wife's affair too. 

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.180
If he's not sure about the affair... 

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.000
It doesn't make sense for him to murder someone over it. 

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:38.240
If that's the case... 

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.760
He might be trying to cover up his wife's crime. 

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.820
Is he trying to carelessly cover up the murder? 

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.130
Why? 

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:50.640
He knew about the situation. 

01:00:51.400 --> 01:01:00.760
The only thing he could give her was his heart. 

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:02.480
And. 

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.800
He wanted to save Lee Ji Soo no matter what. 

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:16.760
Now I know why Lee Ji Soo murdered him and denied it. 

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.810
Why? 

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:21.800
Because her husband might find out. 

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:29.810
He might fall apart from the pain she's caused him. 

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:35.500
She's hiding it so he won't find out. 

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.990
She's covering it with a lie. 

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.990
So let's say Kim Joo Chul is protecting his wife... 

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:51.890
He'll probably admit he committed the murder. 

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:00.580
The husband is trying to protect his wife. 

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.640
The wife is trying to protect her husband. 

01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:59.410
Please don't tell my husband like you promised. 

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.850
We're done now, right? 

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:10.130
What do you mean? 

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.660
This is just the beginning. 

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:23.120
Your confession... 

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:27.060
We still haven't told Lee Ji Soo. 

01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:33.230
The moment she finds out... 

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:38.140
She'll know that you know what she's done. 

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:42.730
The secret she was holding in being revealed... 

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:43.980
She'll know. 

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.580
She'll probably fall apart. 

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.950
From her pride. 

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:56.540
The pain you would feel... 

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.560
She was more worried about that. 

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.250
How to go about protecting your wife... 

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.940
Is your choice. 

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:56.100
I'll never forgive you. 

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.150
Was it fun? 

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:03.160
Deceiving me... 

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.550
Looking down on me... 

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.900
Going with another man. 

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:16.720
I never once doubted you. 

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.840
I'll never forget the humiliation you caused me. 

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:46.830
It's a husband's duty to protect his wife. 

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:59.060
But I've never once done that. 

01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:14.360
I didn't know how to protect her... 

01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:19.020
For the first time... 

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.000
I want to protect my wife. 

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.990
Joo Chul. 

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.390
I have something to say. 

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:54.060
It was so hard back then. 

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:59.370
I thought if I could just save you... 

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:12.850
It wouldn't matter if I fell apart. 

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:17.480
But it was hard. 

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:30.180
I was going to leave Hwang Sung Min. 

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.980
But that didn't work either. 

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:51.460
Sometimes I resented you. 

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:03.160
Because of my wrong choices... 

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:08.220
I lost you. 

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:16.080
And I was scared I would lose myself too. 

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:25.189
I wanted to tell you. 

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:29.670
But I didn't have the courage. 

01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:39.670
I'm truly sorry. 

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:43.399
I apologize. 

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:49.760
That I kept this a secret from you. 

01:08:55.850 --> 01:09:00.330
Hwang Sung Min must be like a deadly infection to you. 

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:06.330
He made you a host and kept you infected. 

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:15.620
You were afraid of spreading it to your husband. 

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:21.660
But... 

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:25.859
There's something you don't know. 

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.510
Your husband has the antibodies. 

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.420
Antibodies that could kill the virus. 

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.920
Are you going to keep this a secret again and save yourself? 

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:51.479
or are you going to use this as an opportunity to stop the virus together? 

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:59.060
The choice is yours. 

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:20.340
Bring my husband in. 

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:10.020
Will they be able to beat the virus together? 

01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:14.530
It won't be easy. 

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:20.350
The virus has a lot of variants. 

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.410
But it's still worth a try. 

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.420
Nam Yeh Ri. 

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:44.580
Director Yeo... 

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:50.070
Shouldn't we make a way for him to find out the truth? 

01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:57.750
That's cruel. 

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.230
Director Yeo... 

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.110
If he finds out the truth about Song Kyung Tae... 

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.090
Could he handle it? 

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:20.280
We should also tell Director Yeo... 

01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:25.680
...that there are antibodies out there. 

01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:53.040

A bar owner and a doctor. 

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.780
Where were these two headed this morning? 

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:04.410
My sister didn't deserve to die. 

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:06.520
If only I had a little more strength. 

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.280
Park Soon Young had a younger brother. 

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.760
Park Joon Young. 

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.660
Kim Min Sun was outside but he got in and locked it from the inside. 

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:17.190
How is that possible? 

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.260
Park Joon Young? 

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.530
Park Joon Young!
