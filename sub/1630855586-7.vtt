00:06.006 --> 00:07.549
<i>There's one particular phase</i>

00:07.549 --> 00:11.720
<i>between baby being and full grown being
that is widely viewed as the most awkward</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:14.473
<i>and difficult
of a being's emotional journey.</i>

00:14.473 --> 00:16.183
<i>To make it even more challenging,</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:18.977
<i>this is when the adolescent limbshake occurs.</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:23.232
<i>The adolescent limbshake combines
the highest levels of social drama.</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:26.235
Will you shake limbs with me?

00:26.235 --> 00:27.236
No.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.112
Oh, my self-worth.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.782
<i>And the lowest levels
of certainty about one's self.</i>

00:31.782 --> 00:34.034
I'm not even sure how my body works!

00:34.034 --> 00:37.371
<i>And then just for good measure,
the scrutiny of one's entire peer group.</i>

00:37.371 --> 00:40.499
<i>Every being I know
is staring at me right now.</i>

00:40.499 --> 00:42.584
<i>Ah, to be a teen.</i>

00:48.507 --> 00:51.260
<i>Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning</i>

00:51.260 --> 00:53.053
<i>Orbiting a star</i>

00:53.804 --> 00:56.473
<i>We find ways to give life meaning</i>

00:56.473 --> 00:58.016
<i>Some might seem bizarre</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:01.270
<i>All we know is that we exist</i>

01:01.270 --> 01:04.272
<i>And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on</i>

01:04.272 --> 01:06.608
<i>Joy and sadness, courage and fear</i>

01:06.608 --> 01:09.278
<i>Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger</i>

01:09.278 --> 01:11.613
<i>And it's only getting stranger
From here</i>

01:25.377 --> 01:27.504
You're putting yourself in danger.

01:27.504 --> 01:31.800
Yeah, because you won't show me
who you really are.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.639
My ice-cold blood pump makes me
consume other beings.

01:37.639 --> 01:41.560
I hide this to protect you
and to love you.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.440
Time to perish.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.109
Why are you doing this?

01:49.109 --> 01:53.071
Because you want to sink
your mouthstones into me.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.668
Dampvires!

02:06.668 --> 02:09.838
Oh, my Lorb! Incredible.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.424
Like, who would have ever
anticipated that twist?

02:13.050 --> 02:15.135
My best guess. Most viewers.

02:15.135 --> 02:19.097
According to GiveMyBlood2dampies,
that beam of light is a Dampvire ship.

02:19.097 --> 02:22.184
I kinda miss when it was
about more conventional blood-sucking.

02:22.184 --> 02:27.231
It's just so much better now.
Wow, what did we even do before <i>Dampvires</i>?

02:27.231 --> 02:29.525
I don't know, talk?

02:30.234 --> 02:35.572
<i>Do you ever think, "Hey, what if my body
smelt nothing like a body?"</i>

02:39.868 --> 02:42.204
Oh, my Lorb. They're--

02:42.204 --> 02:45.707
So annoying. I can't stand
when a being knows they're attractive.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.042
That's kind of their job.

02:47.042 --> 02:50.420
Their show <i>Hot Beings Do Hot Things</i>
is like all ego.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.258
<i>Hot Beings</i> is the same as <i>Dampvires</i>
just without the extra mouthstones.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.388
Ride's here. Let's plan something
for the limbshake coming up.

02:59.388 --> 03:03.642
Yes, ring me tonight.
I need answers about the show!

03:03.642 --> 03:06.395
We'll find out next episode.

03:06.395 --> 03:10.190
That's a whole week away!

03:11.358 --> 03:12.359
Okay, bye.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.114
What do you mean there's an infestation
of furry cheese pests?

03:17.823 --> 03:19.241
Do you understand what this'll do to me?

03:19.241 --> 03:23.495
My peers will ostracize me.
I have to throw the best limbshake!

03:24.663 --> 03:27.541
Is this the Adolescent Limbshake
Student Planning Committee?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.960
This is a committee of one.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.545
That's sad.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.840
No, it isn't. Everyone knows
how hard it is to put on a good limbshake.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.177
So no one signs up because they don't
wanna be responsible for it.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.888
Great. This delinquent student
will be joining you

03:40.888 --> 03:45.309
for adolescent limbshake planning
to make up for their not-so-funny prank.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.811
You can't use the planning committee
as punishment.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.647
Based on what you said,
it sounds like punishment enough for me.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.527
Yeah, I filled the courtyard with foam.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.237
It was actually awesome.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.488
I don't want your help.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.575
It's all good. Help isn't really my thing.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.870
<i>Good luck with that situation.</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:12.002
All, meet your new class being.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.462
Tell us a little about yourself.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.841
Greets, just moved here
from New Placefield.

04:17.841 --> 04:22.221
Got my mouthstones fixed.
And I love being wherever the fun is.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.014
Where my fun beings at?

04:24.014 --> 04:27.643
Okay, why don't you find a seat over--

04:29.853 --> 04:30.687
Sure.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.065
- Greets.
- Greets.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.149
Greets.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.736
So, we will now work in teams to make
several dangerous ingredients

04:37.736 --> 04:39.863
and hopefully learn something. Begin.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.282
I like your hat.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.160
Gratitude. Are you a fan?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.289
- I love it.
- The acting is--

04:49.289 --> 04:53.126
Incredible. And, oh, my Lorb.
Have you seen the new perfume ad that--

04:53.126 --> 04:55.045
Yes, they look so hot!

04:55.045 --> 04:56.129
The hottest!

04:56.630 --> 05:01.468
Shows like <i>Dampvires</i> are pure art.
<i>Hot Beings</i> has nothing going for it.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.011
Nothing but hotness.

05:04.096 --> 05:09.935
Look, no being said <i>Hot Beings</i> is art.
It's just, you know, actually fun.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.021
Bad-show liker.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.314
Bad-insult sayer.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.567
I don't know you well enough
to insult you properly yet.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.655
I can't wait to go shopping with you
for the limbshake.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.491
We're gonna look amazing
while doing our best friend limbshake!

05:24.491 --> 05:27.870
Maybe it would be nice if we brought
the new student with us.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.955
Since it's hard to make friends
in a new school.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.499
Yeah, hard when you're mean like them.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.294
We were just expressing an opinion
about a show we like.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.296
What? I don't like that show.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.256
I like that show.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.967
Ever since you've gotten
obsessed with <i>Dampvires</i>

05:41.967 --> 05:44.094
you stopped listening to me.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.763
So you're mad at me
for not liking <i>Hot Beings</i>.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.641
Oh, my Lorb. You're proving my point.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.393
You read me fan fictions

05:51.393 --> 05:53.729
and tell me what shows I should
and shouldn't be watching.

05:53.729 --> 05:58.066
Then eat all my sauce pockets.
This is barely a friendship anymore.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.863
So, we aren't going shopping later?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.748
Stupid cute infestation!

06:14.333 --> 06:16.251
I'm sure they were just looking
for a new home.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.337
The stakes for the tiny creatures
are much higher

06:18.337 --> 06:20.589
than for us needing a new limbshake venue.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.926
This is supposed to be
a night to remember! That's the theme!

06:23.926 --> 06:26.803
Why does this matter so much to you?

06:26.803 --> 06:30.599
I'm here for punishment.
You're choosing avoidable pain.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.726
I like seeing beings have fun.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.978
And I wanted the limbshake
to be unforgettable.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.898
But now it seems there won't be
a limbshake to forget.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.734
Yeah, they're all forgettable.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.989
Now I have to start over
and find a new venue.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.824
This is hard to watch.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.370
Look, I'll help you so I can get out
of this depressing detention sooner.

06:52.955 --> 06:56.124
Okay, delinquent.
Let's go look at some venues.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.921
- This could be fun.
- This is not a limbshake venue.

07:01.505 --> 07:05.133
It could be.
An outdoor limbshake under the moons.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.012
I'm glad you like it.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.347
That wasn't me.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.354
This could be fun. What a view.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.148
This can only hold eight beings.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.401
That's a lot of limbs.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.987
This could be fun. Industrial.

07:25.487 --> 07:31.159
It is industrial.
But I think we could maybe make it work.

07:32.870 --> 07:33.871
No!

07:43.380 --> 07:47.342
Sorry about my friend earlier.
They get fired up about <i>Dampvires</i>.

07:47.342 --> 07:51.930
I get it. I'm wearing a <i>Hot Beings</i> hat,
so clearly, I understand fandom.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.766
Sometimes I even sing
the theme song to myself.

07:54.766 --> 07:59.855
<i>Hot beings do hot things
With rippling abs</i>

08:02.649 --> 08:06.320
You're really fun.
Would you be my first new friend?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.280
Sorry, I can be awkward
when meeting new beings.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.990
You weren't awkward.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.909
I was impressed with your confidence

08:11.909 --> 08:13.911
when having that heated exchange
with my bestie.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.747
So about this limbshake. Are you gonna go?

08:17.289 --> 08:19.583
'Cause I'm going shopping tonight
for my accessory.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.294
Totally. I need something for my limbs.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.591
One jitter liquid, please.

08:27.591 --> 08:31.637
Sure, would you like to jitter
for one, two, or five hours?

08:32.804 --> 08:34.097
Two, please.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.226
This is impossible.
We're never gonna find a limbshake venue.

08:37.226 --> 08:42.022
We will find a venue,
just not necessarily a good one.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.566
Hey, there. Sounds like a frustrating day.

08:44.566 --> 08:48.737
Can I lift your spirits with jitter liquid
or half off yesterday's sweet treats?

08:48.737 --> 08:51.114
They may not be fresh,
but neither is a lot of stuff.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.659
No amount of stale sweet treats

08:53.659 --> 08:55.869
is going to make
a limbshake venue available.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.705
In search of a limbshake venue?
Why not consider Careful Now?

08:59.289 --> 09:02.292
This isn't our ideal choice for a venue.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.461
It's nobody's ideal choice for a venue.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.839
- I don't--
- Sounds great. We'll take it.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.427
What about these bracelets?

09:12.427 --> 09:14.513
They make a funny noise
when you shake your limbs.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.434
And they each have a glomrock charm

09:19.434 --> 09:21.311
so when they're near each other--

09:21.937 --> 09:24.147
They stick together. So cool.

09:29.987 --> 09:34.908
What a hideous new best friend limbshake.
Those moves are so derivative.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.660
We're just having fun.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.829
At least I'm able to have a conversation
with them

09:38.829 --> 09:40.289
that doesn't involve <i>Dampvires</i>.

09:41.540 --> 09:46.128
Forget <i>Dampvires</i> and Hot Beings,
this is some serious drama.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.380
Have fun with your new friend.

09:49.131 --> 09:49.965
I will!

09:53.719 --> 09:55.137
This is the adult beings only section.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.431
So you wouldn't have access
to this part of the restaurant.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.308
We'll see about that.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.020
No seriously.
I could get in a lot of trouble.

10:03.020 --> 10:07.816
Hello, younger beings. Are we now part
of an after learnstitution program?

10:07.816 --> 10:09.443
I'm showing these adolescent beings around.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.153
They wanna book Careful Now
for their limbshake.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.279
Want is a strong word.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.447
We're desperate.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.199
Have you run this by the owner?

10:15.866 --> 10:16.700
Not yet.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.161
Okay, well, have you consulted
the engineer

10:19.161 --> 10:21.580
about how many adolescent beings
we could support here?

10:21.580 --> 10:23.248
Also not yet.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.416
Hey, engineer!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.794
How many adolescent beings
could Careful Now support for a limbshake?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.548
I'd say about 100 should be fine

10:31.548 --> 10:33.509
if they don't all shake their limbs
at the same time.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.678
Just kidding.

10:36.678 --> 10:40.933
There's only a slim chance of this place
falling into the void during a limbshake.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.309
So, nothing to worry about.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.020
That actually may be
an exciting draw for our peers.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.899
The risk of perishing awakens
an unparalleled primal joy in us

10:48.899 --> 10:51.818
which manifests
the most magnificent limbshakes.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.695
Well, that's horrifying.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.281
I did not think they were capable
of such description.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.243
How do you feel about building the theme
around mortality?

10:59.243 --> 11:00.577
A night to remember

11:00.577 --> 11:04.623
because you almost perished
due to an unstable cliffside location!

11:04.623 --> 11:07.584
It's angsty. Let's do it.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.629
This is going to be a weird event.
But a booking's a booking.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.634
- Hey, there. Something on your mind?
- Nothing really.

11:15.634 --> 11:19.012
Come on, blended jitter for your thoughts?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.974
I'm just a bit bummed out
about the limbshake, that's all.

11:22.808 --> 11:26.645
I always imagined I'd go with my bestie
and do our best friend limbshake.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.981
But that doesn't mean
I'm not stoked to go with you.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.400
I get it. Nothing can replace
your favorite friend.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.319
Would it cheer you up
if we invent a new friend limbshake?

11:34.319 --> 11:36.697
Couldn't hurt to try.
Where should we start?

11:36.697 --> 11:40.951
Well, rumor has it,
this limbshake's theme is perishing.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.536
And where I come from

11:42.536 --> 11:45.581
there's this odd shake
that is reminiscent of perishing.

11:45.581 --> 11:46.999
It goes something like--

11:50.794 --> 11:52.171
Two, three, four.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.427
No!

12:03.432 --> 12:05.392
More brains coming through.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.852
Why fake brains?

12:06.852 --> 12:10.230
I thought the theme was Night To Remember
Because You Almost Perished.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.316
Because beings wouldn't remember
without brains.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.318
And they certainly couldn't survive
without them either.

12:14.318 --> 12:17.738
It's not what I expected when I heard
a limbshake would be taking place here.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.782
But, what would I know?
No one ever wanted to limbshake with me.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.910
You've never limbshaked?

12:23.493 --> 12:25.871
- Factual.
- That's sad.

12:25.871 --> 12:26.955
Really sad.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.498
I'm sorry?

12:28.498 --> 12:31.126
No. I mean for them.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.461
I meant for you.

12:33.045 --> 12:36.131
Like beings didn't get the joy of having
you there. You know, shaking limbs.

12:37.799 --> 12:41.220
Weird energy here.
I'm going over there now.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.183
Falafel off a cliff,
butternut squashed being soup,

12:46.183 --> 12:49.269
crumble to the floor cake.
These are all pretty great.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.981
Thanks. I enjoy creating clever menu items
for a themed party.

12:53.524 --> 12:56.860
- I like the decorations you made.
- Thanks.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.535
How did you discover
you like to organize limbshakes?

13:04.535 --> 13:07.454
When I was growing up, my lifegivers
loved to host limbshake parties

13:07.454 --> 13:08.539
for their friends.

13:08.539 --> 13:12.000
I was just a small being
but that elation was invigorating.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.628
I wanted to follow
in my lifegivers' footsteps

13:14.628 --> 13:18.799
and provide that same kinda joy
and hopefully make some friends of my own.

13:18.799 --> 13:22.219
Though it must be difficult to admit
you have no friends,

13:22.219 --> 13:24.179
I believe that is a deception.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.305
A deception?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.766
Well, yeah. Aren't we friends?

13:28.767 --> 13:30.894
I guess so.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.398
Skull bone sandwich?

13:35.899 --> 13:37.818
<i>Check out these</i> Hot Beings <i>treats.</i>

13:37.818 --> 13:39.611
<i>This effect makes you a hot being.</i>

13:39.611 --> 13:41.572
- Hot Beings.
- Hot--

13:41.572 --> 13:43.907
<i>Today I'm trying
the</i> Hot Beings <i>face care routine.</i>

13:45.576 --> 13:48.871
Fine. Let's see just how fun
this show really is.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.665
Hot Beings.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.713
For a being that loves talking
and listening so much,

13:57.713 --> 13:59.882
there's certainly not a lot
of that happening here.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.221
But they do have
such well-defined cheekbones.

14:06.221 --> 14:09.683
<i>You look hot in that liquid.</i>

14:11.310 --> 14:13.228
I cannot argue with this logic.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.650
- One more time. You almost got it.
- Okay.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.402
Thanks for being patient with me.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.905
Let's give it one more go.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.165
And--

14:34.416 --> 14:35.542
I did it!

14:35.542 --> 14:36.668
That was great!

14:36.668 --> 14:40.923
I love that. Yeah. It's gonna be so fun.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.967
That seems like a fun group.
See you later!

14:44.843 --> 14:46.470
No worries. See you!

14:49.389 --> 14:51.225
I think that's the last piece.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.518
Thank you for helping today.

14:52.518 --> 14:56.188
Of course.
It's not like I had any choice though.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.232
You did not. No deception.

14:58.232 --> 15:00.275
I did not think
I'd be able to pull this off.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.528
Especially when you were forced
to join me.

15:02.528 --> 15:06.615
I didn't either. We managed to set up
a limbshake everybody is going to love.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.367
We don't know that. Don't jinx us.

15:08.367 --> 15:11.787
Impressing teens is a difficult feat.
They're a fickle bunch.

15:11.787 --> 15:15.082
Well, whether they like it or not,
I'm proud of what we did here.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.627
We had fun and it wasn't
such a bad punishment after all.

15:18.627 --> 15:22.297
I thought I was in for a bad punishment
when we agreed to allow this.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.675
But I'm impressed. You both pulled it off.

15:24.675 --> 15:27.052
It was fun. But we won't know
if we pulled it off

15:27.052 --> 15:29.471
until we know our peers
are enjoying themselves.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.014
Let's boot it up.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.684
Then we can relax and throw back
some blood drink

15:33.684 --> 15:35.602
while we wait for the beings to show up.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.979
Blood drink? Wow.

15:36.979 --> 15:40.065
We really didn't take the time
to give that a clever name, did we?

15:40.065 --> 15:41.859
No. We really didn't.

15:51.702 --> 15:55.956
Limbshake is tonight?
Heard it's at Careful Now. Odd choice.

15:56.623 --> 16:00.502
Yeah. Seems like they changed the theme
to something about almost perishing

16:00.502 --> 16:02.337
to make it sound more exciting.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.800
- I don't know. It could be kinda fun.
- Hopefully.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.807
Oh, no. I spilled my notebook.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.602
I guess this interaction will extend
for more time as I pick it up.

16:16.602 --> 16:20.522
I would offer to help you
gather your things but in doing so

16:20.522 --> 16:25.444
I would cut this awkward interaction
in half, which I don't want to do.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.406
The interaction has come to a natural end.

16:29.948 --> 16:34.786
Prolonging it again would be abnormal.
So, goodbye.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.538
Yeah. Goodbye.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.508
Does it look like anybody is having fun?

16:48.467 --> 16:50.219
Yeah. I think so.

16:50.219 --> 16:51.428
That is deception.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.513
What a dump.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.264
This place smells wet.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.059
They're miserable.

16:57.059 --> 17:00.854
This limbshake is a bust
and I'm not going to make any friends.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.314
What about me?

17:02.314 --> 17:05.608
What about you? This is all your fault.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.612
You chose this place
just to get out of detention sooner.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.198
Did you sabotage me on purpose?

17:13.534 --> 17:18.372
You're right. I fulfilled my punishment,
so now my detention is over. See you.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.389
This limbshake is so boring.

17:35.389 --> 17:38.433
Yeah. Too bad there's not a lot
of limbshaking going on.

17:38.433 --> 17:43.063
That might be more fun.
Maybe if we start it, others would join?

17:43.063 --> 17:45.691
All right, you wild wacky beings!

17:45.691 --> 17:49.486
For this one, grab your best buddy
and do that thing only you and them know

17:49.486 --> 17:53.532
because you made it up.
One, two, three, go!

17:57.411 --> 17:59.162
Boo! This song is for babies.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.250
Wanna debut our new friend limbshake?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.835
Yeah. I don't know.

18:04.835 --> 18:08.130
That doesn't sound as fun
as whatever those beings are doing.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.634
- And I go where the fun is. See ya!
- Okay.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.520
I think you're too young for mild poison.

18:24.521 --> 18:28.066
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I promise I'm not a dampvire.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.110
What are you doing in there?

18:30.110 --> 18:32.821
Sometimes I like to be present
in a different location

18:32.821 --> 18:34.364
to give me perspective.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.491
You seem down, friend.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.161
Maybe you would like
to spend some time in the locker?

18:39.161 --> 18:42.998
Someone I thought was my friend accused me
of sabotaging the limbshake

18:42.998 --> 18:46.502
and blames me for its failure.
I didn't sign up for this.

18:46.502 --> 18:50.464
It became fun to be around them.
And I genuinely wanted to help.

18:50.464 --> 18:54.218
When I was younger, I, too,
experienced a similar situation.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.302
What happened?

18:55.302 --> 18:56.428
They perished.

18:56.428 --> 18:59.139
Oh, Lorb. That was a short story.

18:59.139 --> 19:02.643
But that's why you shouldn't waste
your limited time with your friend,

19:02.643 --> 19:03.977
feeling upset.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.521
You understand what I'm getting at?

19:05.521 --> 19:08.482
I do. It's morbid, but I do.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.734
It certainly puts things into perspective.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.654
So I definitely don't need
to get into that locker.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.155
Your loss.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.283
I gotta save this limbshake.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.994
I can help you with that.
What do you have in mind?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.562
- I'm sorry I wasn't listening to you.
- I'm sorry I'm such a jerk.

19:46.562 --> 19:48.313
I'm sorry. I was so mean.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.066
I should have paid more attention to you
and our conversations.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.443
And I'm sorry for eating
all your sauce pockets.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.320
I accept your apology.

19:55.320 --> 19:59.074
And I want you to know my behavior did not
reflect how I actually felt about you.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.869
I wasn't trying to replace you
or ignore you.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.495
I'm sorry for being mean too.

20:03.495 --> 20:06.081
I just wanted you
to understand how I felt.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.083
I totally understand.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.085
I've been dying to talk to you
about <i>Hot Beings</i>.

20:10.836 --> 20:11.879
I watched the whole season,

20:11.879 --> 20:14.006
and I'm super hot for <i>Hot Beings</i>.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.592
I missed you.

20:17.593 --> 20:20.679
- I missed you too.
- Wanna go shake some limbs?

20:20.679 --> 20:22.931
Do hot beings do hot things?

20:36.486 --> 20:38.030
Give me the mic.

20:38.030 --> 20:40.574
Remember what happened
the last time I gave you a mic?

20:40.574 --> 20:43.619
Yes, I used it to replicate
the majestic sounds

20:43.619 --> 20:46.663
of the tusk creature's flatulence,
but this is different.

20:46.663 --> 20:50.584
I'm going to save this limbshake
about perishing from perishing.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.378
Fine. I'm flailing here.

20:53.378 --> 20:57.216
Thank you. When I give you the signal,
play this song.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.136
We're all gonna perish!

21:01.678 --> 21:02.721
What did you say?

21:04.389 --> 21:06.975
Sorry, not now, but eventually.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.977
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

21:10.646 --> 21:13.607
You've got this. Remember the locker.

21:15.192 --> 21:17.152
Think about what we're all doing here.

21:17.152 --> 21:21.031
We all came to this limbshake
to shake our limbs with our friends,

21:21.031 --> 21:24.910
to burn off some of the daily stresses
of being a teen.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.995
That banner says "night to remember,"

21:26.995 --> 21:29.831
but I think we're probably going
to forget this night

21:29.831 --> 21:32.584
if we're lucky enough
to live to be old beings.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.461
So why not enjoy it?

21:34.461 --> 21:38.590
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
all of us are going to perish one day,

21:38.590 --> 21:40.843
and it's time to live!

21:45.806 --> 21:47.266
This being gets it.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.934
Deejay, hit it.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.937
Everybody, limbshake!

21:55.774 --> 21:59.069
The foam is making me wanna shake.

22:03.532 --> 22:04.783
Best friend limbshake?

22:04.783 --> 22:06.076
Best friend limbshake.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.293
You did it! You saved the limbshake!

22:14.918 --> 22:16.712
We saved the limbshake.

22:16.712 --> 22:21.550
No amount of tiny, furry creatures
or horrible venues or lethargic teens

22:21.550 --> 22:23.510
could overcome our teamwork.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.220
I'm sorry I said what I did.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.015
The limbshake has been very frustrating,

22:28.015 --> 22:30.726
but you really nailed
the theme in that speech.

22:30.726 --> 22:35.189
I know, and I didn't always
make it easier on you.

22:35.189 --> 22:38.609
Working with you on this limbshake
made my life more interesting.

22:38.609 --> 22:41.695
It made me happy. I never expected that.

22:42.988 --> 22:44.615
Would you like to limbshake with me?

22:44.615 --> 22:47.075
Do all beings perish?

22:57.920 --> 22:59.296
Let's limbshake.

23:02.299 --> 23:04.676
- Seriously?
- I'd be honored

23:04.676 --> 23:06.720
if you'd join me for a limbshake.

23:06.720 --> 23:10.349
I fear there are over 100 beings
already limbshaking.

23:10.349 --> 23:11.808
It could be dangerous.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.311
I counted. There are 98.
