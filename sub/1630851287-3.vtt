(yawns) Good morning.

00:37.279 --> 00:39.038
What? Oof. Sorry, everyone.

00:39.189 --> 00:41.189
I know I usually give you
a little more to work with

00:41.283 --> 00:42.524
at breakfast enthusiasm-wise,

00:42.618 --> 00:44.376
but the darkest days
of the Alaskan winter

00:44.528 --> 00:48.196
make old Judy Tootie less fresh
and more moody than usual.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.108
Yes, 24 hours of near
total darkness have a way

00:51.201 --> 00:53.719
of wreaking havoc
on a person's mental state.

00:53.946 --> 00:55.203
But hey, that's the price we pay

00:55.297 --> 00:57.222
to live a life of hard work
in a hostile environment.

00:57.415 --> 00:59.299
Do you guys remember the sun?

00:59.451 --> 01:01.118
It was like a big,
dumb lamp in the sky

01:01.136 --> 01:02.135
you didn't have to turn on.

01:02.288 --> 01:03.545
Lady Daylight will return.

01:03.639 --> 01:06.381
At peak summer, it's only dark
for 45 minutes a day.

01:06.475 --> 01:08.141
Makes going to the drive-in
almost impossible.

01:08.294 --> 01:09.884
Well, at least during
the light days

01:09.978 --> 01:11.144
we don't have to worry about...

01:11.297 --> 01:13.054
(dramatically):
lumber zombies.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.573
-(Wolf cackles)
-Wolf, mmm.

01:14.724 --> 01:17.301
Do we have to hear
the lumber zombie story again?

01:17.394 --> 01:18.819
Yeah, it's scary,
and also probably

01:18.913 --> 01:20.137
just a dumb local legend.

01:20.230 --> 01:22.397
Uh, agree to disagree,
Jude-etee.

local-true real thing

-Not now, Ham!
I'm telling a story.

<i> Logging Company,</i>

01:33.836 --> 01:36.336
<i> tired of having to shut down</i>
<i> business during the dark days,</i>

01:36.488 --> 01:38.597
<i> devised an evil plan</i>
<i> to create a mindless workforce</i>

01:38.824 --> 01:41.249
<i> that could 'jack in total</i>
<i> darkness and never get tired.</i>

01:41.343 --> 01:44.161
-Did you just shorten
lumberjack to 'jack?
-Yeah.

01:44.254 --> 01:46.555
<i>They needed guys who could 'jack</i>
<i> from dusk till dawn.</i>

01:46.607 --> 01:49.090
<i> So they started doing</i>
<i> horrible experiments.</i>

01:49.184 --> 01:51.668
<i>But they made one fatal mistake.</i>

01:51.687 --> 01:54.446
<i> They accidentally created</i>
<i> lumber zombies.</i>

01:54.673 --> 01:57.174
<i> And they were like, "You just</i>
<i> slapped the salmon, log boss,</i>

01:57.267 --> 01:58.692
<i> 'cause I'm a zombie!"</i>

01:58.786 --> 01:59.843
<i> (growling)</i>

01:59.862 --> 02:01.027
<i> "No, get off of me!"</i>

02:01.180 --> 02:02.604
<i> "No, you get off!"</i>
<i> "Quit it!"</i>

02:02.623 --> 02:04.289
"Argh, I'm gonna eat
your damn butt cheeks!"

02:04.516 --> 02:06.107
(sighs)
Well, y-you get it.

02:06.201 --> 02:07.960
And some say that lumber zombies
survive to this day,

02:08.187 --> 02:10.445
waiting for the darkest time
of the year,

02:10.464 --> 02:12.372
to emerge once again
and create more zombies.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.024
One minute you're minding
your own business,

02:14.117 --> 02:15.450
sucking on a snowball;

02:15.544 --> 02:17.377
next minute, you're jackin'
for all of eternity.

02:17.529 --> 02:18.528
Where's the proof?

02:18.547 --> 02:19.880
Well, all kinds of weird
stuff happens

02:20.032 --> 02:21.214
during the dark days--

02:21.367 --> 02:23.533
people going missing,
strange accidents,

02:23.552 --> 02:25.978
delivery orders get mixed up
and you get pad Thai

02:26.129 --> 02:27.146
for someone named "Jeft."

02:27.297 --> 02:28.796
It's got to be lumber zombies.

02:28.891 --> 02:31.375
No. The strange stuff always has
a rational explanation.

02:31.393 --> 02:33.318
People are sleepy,
so they make mistakes.

02:33.545 --> 02:36.137
The constant darkness
causes them to feel detached

02:36.157 --> 02:37.397
and lose their grip on reality,

02:37.549 --> 02:38.991
but there's
a very simple solution:

02:39.142 --> 02:40.550
just don't do that.

02:40.569 --> 02:42.161
Maybe we should stop
talking about this.

02:42.312 --> 02:44.905
Sorry, Moon, I know the
lumber zombie story scares you.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.073
Not anymore.
That was when I was a kid.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.650
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:48.744 --> 02:51.077
I have to go get my lucky
puffy penguin pencil topper

02:51.230 --> 02:52.896
because I have a test today.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.915
I know Moon says
he's not scared,

02:55.067 --> 02:56.400
but keep an eye on him.

02:56.418 --> 02:58.068
You know what, Dad?
If it's all right with you,

02:58.086 --> 02:59.419
I'm gonna keep both eyes on him.

02:59.571 --> 03:01.180
In fact, you should all
keep an eye on each other,

03:01.407 --> 03:04.683
since today I undertake
a 24-hour rest

03:04.834 --> 03:05.759
on the shortest day.

03:05.911 --> 03:07.352
Ah, yes, the Beef Sleep.

03:07.504 --> 03:10.414
A time where I allow
the body and mind to recuperate

03:10.507 --> 03:12.357
from working so hard
the rest of the year.

03:12.509 --> 03:14.509
I get it, it's like
when I drink a 5-hour Energy.

03:14.603 --> 03:17.437

very, very fun five hours,

15:18.309 --> 15:20.752
themselves zombies
and we need to get out of here.

15:20.979 --> 15:22.979
Oh, okay, great.
Thanks for including me.

15:22.997 --> 15:25.072
-(banging on door)
-BOY: Let me in!

15:25.166 --> 15:28.092
Crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap!

15:28.987 --> 15:30.836
Oh, no.

15:30.989 --> 15:32.430
Oh, hell no!

15:32.581 --> 15:33.990
-Shrimp!
-Shrimp!

15:34.083 --> 15:35.433
Shrimp!

15:35.660 --> 15:37.918
Let me guess, you guys are
hallucinating-- I'm a shrimp?

15:37.938 --> 15:39.162
You nailed it, Ronda.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.754
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Classic stage three.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.331
No. No, this is really bad!

15:42.350 --> 15:44.108
Everyone is shrimp,
the world is shrimp,

15:44.335 --> 15:45.926
shrimp are
all I have ever known!

15:45.946 --> 15:47.278
And all you will ever know.

15:47.505 --> 15:49.280
All of consciousness is
just a pink shrimp waterfall

15:49.432 --> 15:52.024
(distorted):
stretching to shrimp-finity.

15:52.177 --> 15:54.677
-Oh, God, now I'm...
-A shrimp. Me too, babe.

15:54.696 --> 15:56.028
How am I pink? I'm Black!

15:56.181 --> 15:57.346
(Wolf sobbing)

15:57.440 --> 15:59.031
So can I get you guys refills
on your sodas?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.125
Actually, I'd love
a big glass of milk, Ronda.

16:02.629 --> 16:07.090
Well, this is exactly what I've
lusted after my whole life.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.677
Keep it coming, my friend.

16:13.531 --> 16:16.032
It's gonna be okay.
Just cover your ears.

16:16.050 --> 16:18.034
Moon, focus on me.
Eyes right here, okay?

16:18.052 --> 16:19.869
Maybe we should
sing him his song?

16:19.962 --> 16:21.795
No. I-I don't need you to...

I got locked out!

16:44.579 --> 16:46.320
Don't listen to her--
she's a zombie.

16:46.414 --> 16:48.247
She's trying to get in here
to eat our brains.

16:48.399 --> 16:50.174
I don't want to be a zombie!
I haven't even had

16:50.326 --> 16:52.585
a retrospective of my artwork
in Stuttgart yet!

16:52.737 --> 16:55.254
Moon, no! Don't do it!

16:55.348 --> 16:56.180
Look, Judy,

16:56.332 --> 16:58.074
I'm the only one
who's vent-sized

16:58.092 --> 16:59.017
and I'm gonna go get us help.

16:59.244 --> 17:00.243
But you're too little.

17:00.261 --> 17:01.761
And you're very, very scared.

17:01.913 --> 17:03.337
No, Judy, I'm not scared.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.930
I mean I'm not<i> that</i> scared.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.432
I'm reasonably scared,

17:06.584 --> 17:08.175
considering what's
been going on today.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.194
But I'm also brave,
and for some reason,

17:10.421 --> 17:12.772
you and Ham can't accept that.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.257
Stay alive.

17:14.350 --> 17:15.366
I'll be back for you.

17:15.518 --> 17:17.535
Oh, sorry,
I put my earbuds back in.

17:17.686 --> 17:19.120
Uh, where is he going?

17:23.268 --> 17:26.210
-(groaning)
-Oh...

17:26.362 --> 17:28.954
Moon doesn't fear the darkness.

17:29.107 --> 17:31.049
The darkness fears the Moon.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.700
It's good 'cause it works
on two levels.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.945
(toilets flushing)

17:36.038 --> 17:38.056
So did you complete stage four?

17:38.207 --> 17:40.040
Is stage four double-dragoning
out of both ends?

17:40.134 --> 17:42.285
It sure is. Are you guys ready
for stage five?

17:42.378 --> 17:44.228
-What's stage five?
-Eating your last ten shrimp,

17:44.380 --> 17:45.897
and then getting your T-shirt.

17:46.048 --> 17:47.548
Take me home, Captain Ronda.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.715
Take me home.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.901
I see you!

17:50.052 --> 17:51.294
You're all dead, you hear me?!

17:51.312 --> 17:52.812
Dead! I'm gonna
rip your heads off!

17:52.964 --> 17:54.297
Choppity chop,
your bones are gone!

17:54.390 --> 17:56.132
Crispin, I know this is sudden,

17:56.225 --> 17:57.316
but I don't want to die single.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.968
Do you want to get married
right now?

17:59.061 --> 18:00.411
-I do.
-Great! I can marry you guys.

18:00.638 --> 18:03.063
I got my certificate online
as part of my art project

18:03.083 --> 18:05.249
-where I married two clams
from the marina.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.263
-No, no, no, no, no!
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:19.415 --> 18:22.934
Now that the power is back on
and everyone's calmed down,

18:23.085 --> 18:24.102
can we all acknowledge that

18:24.329 --> 18:26.011
there was no zombie apocalypse
here today?

18:26.164 --> 18:28.606
So the lurching guy was
just Janitor Jenkins?

18:28.757 --> 18:31.500
Yes, he was in a snow machine
accident over the weekend

18:31.594 --> 18:34.003
and has a cast on his foot;
and he had dental surgery,

18:34.096 --> 18:35.947
so he can't talk.
Hell of a week.

18:36.098 --> 18:37.840
So why was he chasing us?

18:37.933 --> 18:39.117
I sent him to round up any kids

18:39.344 --> 18:40.526
who didn't hear
the instructions.

18:40.678 --> 18:42.361
When the power went out,
we made an announcement

18:42.513 --> 18:44.180
for all the kids to go
to the front of the school

18:44.198 --> 18:45.514
to get picked up
by their parents.

18:45.608 --> 18:47.199
What about wanting us
to be guinea pigs?

18:47.293 --> 18:49.127
You and Ham are
two of our brightest bulbs.

18:49.278 --> 18:50.777
I wanted to talk to you
about starting

18:50.797 --> 18:52.296
a peer tutoring program.

18:52.523 --> 18:55.040
What about Mrs. Feldspar?
She was dead on the floor.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.360
Sometimes Mrs. Feldspar has

18:57.453 --> 19:00.120
a few too many coffee-tinis
in the morning.

19:00.214 --> 19:01.973
She's from
a different generation.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.790
But the kids
in the nurse's office.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.368
They were all pale and creepy.

19:05.386 --> 19:07.370
We had some kids with
the stomach flu this morning,

19:07.463 --> 19:09.872
and their parents were at work
and couldn't pick them up yet,

19:09.965 --> 19:11.298
including
John's younger brother.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.210
Oh! So that's why the nurse
said he'd been exposed.

19:14.303 --> 19:16.712
And I guess it wasn't blood
on Debbie's face.

19:16.805 --> 19:17.971
It was makeup.

19:18.065 --> 19:19.306
I was practicing
my look for Junior Worlds.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.550
My routine demands
a smoky eye and a bold lip.

19:21.644 --> 19:22.643
I won't apologize.

19:22.737 --> 19:24.720
But I also saw a teacher

19:24.813 --> 19:25.979
carrying a body this morning,

19:25.999 --> 19:27.648
across the lawn
from the old gym.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.225
Are you talking about him?

19:29.243 --> 19:32.003
-(all scream)
-(laughs) It's a CPR dummy.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.746
I borrowed it
because we're shooting

19:33.840 --> 19:35.231
a music video for my band.

19:35.249 --> 19:37.175
Well, I didn't want
to mention it,

19:37.326 --> 19:39.326
but I did think I saw
a zombie Mr. Golovkin

19:39.345 --> 19:41.846
attacking Ms. Anderson
from the vent.

19:42.073 --> 19:43.422
Oh, those two.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.832
I don't know why they're keeping
their relationship a secret.

19:45.927 --> 19:47.243
We're all very happy for them.

19:47.261 --> 19:49.336
Well, some flowers grow best
in the shade.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.746
Well, even though
I was very startled

19:50.839 --> 19:53.416
when Moon dropped from
the ceiling vent onto my desk,

19:53.509 --> 19:55.434
I'm glad we got this
straightened out.

19:55.586 --> 19:56.527
(all scream)

19:56.720 --> 19:57.770
Oh, hey, guys.

19:57.922 --> 20:00.423
Heads up,
I just bit the janitor.

20:00.516 --> 20:02.942

♪ ♪

20:09.934 --> 20:12.210
(snoring)

20:15.197 --> 20:16.939
Hey, Moon, we just wanted to say

20:16.958 --> 20:18.123
you were really brave today.

20:18.276 --> 20:19.550
And we're sorry
we couldn't accept it.

20:19.777 --> 20:22.035
Yeah, you were like the least
scared out of all of us.

20:22.129 --> 20:23.612
We should've realized it sooner.

20:23.631 --> 20:26.782
But in fairness to me,
I never realize things sooner.

20:26.875 --> 20:29.227
You're getting older and maybe
that's harder for us than you.

20:29.454 --> 20:31.303
Ever since Mom
brought you home and said,

20:31.397 --> 20:33.213
"Here,
you guys handle this one,"

20:33.233 --> 20:35.382
we've been changing your diapers
and reading you stories

20:35.401 --> 20:38.069
and singing you songs,
but maybe you don't

20:38.220 --> 20:39.386
need that stuff from us anymore.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.630
So no more stories,
no more songs.

20:41.724 --> 20:44.149
We'll just look you in the eye,
give you a firm handshake

20:44.302 --> 20:46.560
and wish you a pleasant evening.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.822
You know, my eyes are kind of
tired from the dark days.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.065
Maybe you could read me
a bedtime story?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.584
-Oh, hell yeah.
-We'd love to!

20:53.811 --> 20:54.977
I mean, if you want that.

20:54.996 --> 20:56.312
As long as it's
