Taxes for Harod

01:44.593 --> 01:46.762
Taxes!

You, bend your ear.

01:51.183 --> 01:52.183
Double.

01:57.023 --> 01:58.774
Taxes.

01:59.566 --> 02:01.234
- We need money to

No one can ever recover

02:07.681 --> 02:09.535
from such high interests.

02:09.576 --> 02:11.621
Stop your sniveling,

02:11.622 --> 02:13.664
pay your taxes.

02:13.706 --> 02:15.165
It's easy for you.

02:15.207 --> 02:16.959
- You just keep raising
- your prices.

02:17.001 --> 02:18.064
Your family has

02:18.065 --> 02:19.127
not suffered.

02:19.336 --> 02:20.880
- This does not bode
- well, Joseph.

02:20.921 --> 02:22.444
No, I fear that it will get

02:22.445 --> 02:23.966
worse as the crowd rages.

02:24.008 --> 02:25.093
King Herod is

02:25.094 --> 02:26.176
building a port

02:26.218 --> 02:27.699
that will make Israel

02:27.700 --> 02:29.179
the centre of trade.

02:29.221 --> 02:30.848
- We will all benefit
- one day.

02:30.890 --> 02:32.078
Build, build, build, that

02:32.079 --> 02:33.266
is all that madman does.

02:33.308 --> 02:34.560
At our expense.

02:34.601 --> 02:35.853
- Come, Aaron
- let us go.

02:35.895 --> 02:37.229
- Aaron please let
- us go home.

02:37.270 --> 02:39.189
- I am not a servant
- to Herod.

02:39.231 --> 02:40.291
- I will not be
- silenced...

02:40.315 --> 02:42.275
- How dare you speak
- ill of the King!

02:42.317 --> 02:43.402
Who speaks ill

02:43.403 --> 02:44.486
of the King?

02:44.528 --> 02:46.321
This man, my lord.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.038
Let this man be made

02:54.039 --> 02:55.205
an example of.

02:55.247 --> 02:57.875
Cut off his hand!

02:57.917 --> 02:59.459
- No I beseech
- you, no, no!

02:59.501 --> 03:00.545
Such anarchy will

03:00.546 --> 03:01.587
not be tolerated.

03:01.628 --> 03:03.277
No please, please, please,

03:03.278 --> 03:04.924
I beseech you, please!

03:05.424 --> 03:06.216
Do it!

03:06.258 --> 03:07.384
No, Aaron, Aaron!

03:07.426 --> 03:09.762
Stop!

03:10.262 --> 03:12.098
- Perhaps there
- is another way.

03:12.139 --> 03:13.307
Who dare defies

03:13.308 --> 03:14.474
me now?

03:14.516 --> 03:16.102
Forgive me.

03:16.143 --> 03:17.416
My name is Rabbi Elijah and I

03:17.417 --> 03:18.687
am but a humble servant of God.

03:18.729 --> 03:20.564
I mean no disrespect.

03:21.273 --> 03:22.378
Yes, this man was

03:22.379 --> 03:23.483
out of line,

03:23.525 --> 03:25.235
- but he seems an
- honest citizen,

03:25.277 --> 03:26.758
With a wife and

03:26.759 --> 03:28.238
children.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.199
How will he pay your

03:30.200 --> 03:32.118
taxes with one hand?

03:32.159 --> 03:33.348
You're offering me your

03:33.349 --> 03:34.536
hand instead?

03:34.578 --> 03:37.706
An equal restitution.

03:37.748 --> 03:39.479
Allow him to work off his

03:39.480 --> 03:41.209
debt, not once but two-fold.

03:41.919 --> 03:43.087
That way you will collect

03:43.088 --> 03:44.254
more than you came for,

03:44.296 --> 03:47.133
and this man, this husband and

03:47.134 --> 03:49.969
father, will remain whole.

03:53.388 --> 03:54.661
No, an example must

03:54.662 --> 03:55.933
be made.

03:55.975 --> 03:57.059
Cut off his hand.

03:57.101 --> 03:58.477
No, no, no!

03:58.518 --> 04:02.189
<i>(gasp)</i>

04:02.272 --> 04:05.151
No, no, no!

04:05.192 --> 04:06.674

04:06.675 --> 04:08.154
<i>to you all.</i>

04:08.195 --> 04:09.863

04:09.905 --> 04:11.157
<i>We'll be back.</i>

04:13.160 --> 04:14.493
Aaron, don't die!

04:16.327 --> 04:17.286
Re-bekah.

04:17.329 --> 04:18.810
You must protect

04:18.810 --> 04:20.290
my wife and sons.

04:20.332 --> 04:21.374
Do not exert yourself.

04:21.416 --> 04:23.127
- Don't die, don't
- die, don't die.

04:23.169 --> 04:26.546

Yes.

05:54.051 --> 05:55.570
- God's messenger

Will bring a great

05:57.014 --> 05:58.430
light into this world.

05:58.805 --> 06:00.390
I feel blessed, but I don't

06:00.391 --> 06:01.975
understand why he chose me.

06:02.017 --> 06:04.207
You will make a

06:04.208 --> 06:06.396

Good morning

Joseph, Mary.

06:08.732 --> 06:10.776
Greetings Elijah.

06:10.817 --> 06:12.485
- I see you have
- a new project.

06:12.527 --> 06:15.114
I am well motivated.

06:15.155 --> 06:16.782
Do you have any news

06:16.783 --> 06:18.408
from yesterday?

06:18.450 --> 06:20.035
Such a sad business.

06:20.077 --> 06:21.245
How is she, the

06:21.246 --> 06:22.412
poor widow?

06:22.454 --> 06:24.081
Rebekah.

06:24.123 --> 06:25.124
Not very well.

06:25.165 --> 06:26.333
It's a tragic loss.

06:26.374 --> 06:28.127
Tragic but inevitable.

06:28.168 --> 06:29.441
You were right, Joseph, the

06:29.442 --> 06:30.712
people have had enough.

06:30.754 --> 06:32.422
- Herod has
- gone too far.

06:32.464 --> 06:33.945
His vision comes

06:33.946 --> 06:35.425
at a cost.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.989
Wrongly or rightly, Herod

06:36.990 --> 06:38.511
believes he is uniting Israel.

06:38.553 --> 06:39.864
- If anything will
- unify Israel,

06:39.888 --> 06:40.889
It is the hatred of

06:40.890 --> 06:41.890
this common enemy.

06:46.937 --> 06:48.084
Do you not

06:48.085 --> 06:49.231
agree, Joseph?

06:49.273 --> 06:50.296
I do not agree with

06:50.297 --> 06:51.317
Herod's methods.

06:51.358 --> 06:52.401
But hate only

06:52.402 --> 06:53.443
fuels civil unrest.

06:53.485 --> 06:55.445
- Even if it is against
- a common enemy.

06:55.487 --> 06:56.488
What do you suggest?

06:56.529 --> 06:58.115
I don't know.

06:58.157 --> 07:01.368
Perhaps compassion, love?

07:01.409 --> 07:02.828
- Is that what
- you believe?

07:02.869 --> 07:04.496
Love an enemy?

07:04.537 --> 07:06.248
My friends, the words 'love'

07:06.249 --> 07:07.958
and 'enemy' are not compatible.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.459
Love an enemy.

07:09.501 --> 07:10.732
I fear the heat has finally

07:10.733 --> 07:11.962
gotten to you Joseph!

07:12.004 --> 07:13.735
Will you join us for

07:13.736 --> 07:15.465
supper, Elijah?

07:15.507 --> 07:18.927
Sadly not this time.

07:18.969 --> 07:20.721
I'm on my way to Nazareth

07:20.722 --> 07:22.472
to bring provisions to Rebekah.

07:22.514 --> 07:23.703
Then let us offer you

07:23.704 --> 07:24.891
these provisions.

07:24.933 --> 07:26.476
- Do not trouble
- yourself.

07:26.518 --> 07:27.999
Take care of you and your

07:28.000 --> 07:29.479
own growing family.

07:29.521 --> 07:31.106
- Rebekah needs it
- more than us.

07:31.148 --> 07:32.295
And everyone needs

07:32.296 --> 07:33.441
a helping hand.

Your finest

10:53.141 --> 10:54.601
We must go.

10:54.642 --> 10:55.748
We have to register in the

My neighbor, old Caleb,

opposed Herod.

He hated that our taxes

were being collected

27:07.490 --> 27:08.804
to build a golden eagle in

27:10.159 --> 27:11.702
Such blasphemy.

- Rumor has it he
- is rather ill.

27:20.002 --> 27:21.192
Ill or not, his greed

27:21.193 --> 27:22.380

We must do right

Sometimes I doubt

29:00.229 --> 29:01.646
myself as a mother.

There is no mother

29:02.919 --> 29:04.148

29:04.189 --> 29:05.671
And God knew it when

29:05.672 --> 29:07.151
He chose you.

29:07.192 --> 29:09.695
He chose us, Joseph.

29:11.989 --> 29:14.679
This boy is our Son and we will

29:14.680 --> 29:17.369
raise Him to grow strong,

to be filled

29:19.143 --> 29:20.872
with wisdom,

29:20.914 --> 29:22.458

We offer these two doves

Jacob, and this is Anna,

29:59.870 --> 30:02.060
daughter to Phanuel, a

30:02.061 --> 30:04.249
prophet in her own right.

30:05.751 --> 30:07.128
I am surprised that you

30:08.546 --> 30:09.838
<i>Anna: Yes, of course!</i>

30:09.880 --> 30:12.696
As our sovereign Lord had

30:12.697 --> 30:15.511

He has been sent from God as

31:04.540 --> 31:07.521
an example for all of humanity.

Herod was appointed by the

- He's not

His mother was a daughter

- his father from

And you, Rabbi who did

Come forward.

Yes?

34:26.136 --> 34:27.972

- glimpse of them.

34:28.013 --> 34:29.179
So you saw them?

34:29.222 --> 34:30.556
Yes, from a distance.

34:30.599 --> 34:32.100
- They took pause
- at an inn.

Did you happen upon

34:37.710 --> 34:39.274
a young boy?

34:39.315 --> 34:40.900
Yes, there were several.

34:40.943 --> 34:41.985
Did the Magi take

34:41.987 --> 34:43.027
any special interest

34:43.069 --> 34:45.030
- in any of
- these boys?

34:46.239 --> 34:47.533
May I ask why you are interested

34:47.534 --> 34:48.826
in these children?

34:48.867 --> 34:50.159
No you may not ask.

34:50.201 --> 34:52.036
Answer the question!

34:52.078 --> 34:53.914
Did the Magi speak

34:53.915 --> 34:55.748
to any of them?

34:55.791 --> 34:57.751
- I could not say
- for certain.

34:57.793 --> 34:58.961
I had an extra cup

34:58.962 --> 35:00.128
of wine with dinner

35:00.170 --> 35:01.234
and the rest of the

35:01.235 --> 35:02.297

(laughing)

35:03.048 --> 35:04.967
Silence!

35:05.801 --> 35:07.302

The Son of God has been

35:08.742 --> 35:10.138
born in Bethlehem.

35:10.180 --> 35:11.911

35:13.684 --> 35:15.540
Sire, if we were certain that

35:15.541 --> 35:17.395
such an event had come to pass,

35:17.437 --> 35:19.648
we would say.

35:19.690 --> 35:21.900
You, did you see such a

35:21.901 --> 35:24.110
child of God at this inn?

35:25.403 --> 35:29.366
I really couldn't say.

35:30.408 --> 35:31.660
- But I do remember
- something.

35:31.702 --> 35:32.911
Yes?

35:32.953 --> 35:34.347
- The Magi journeyed
- south before sunrise.

South?

<i>Yes.</i>

No, they journeyed south.

[♪♪]

44:13.348 --> 44:15.372
The Scriptures have no room

44:15.373 --> 44:17.394
for misinterpretation.

44:17.435 --> 44:18.395
Death is death.

44:18.436 --> 44:19.896
This is final.

44:19.937 --> 44:21.565
- You are being
- too literal.

44:21.606 --> 44:22.607
There is room for

44:22.608 --> 44:23.608
interpretation.

44:23.691 --> 44:25.318
There is an afterlife!

44:25.360 --> 44:27.384
Where God punishes the wicked,

44:27.385 --> 44:29.406
and rewards the righteous.

44:29.447 --> 44:30.574
Nowhere does it say

44:30.575 --> 44:31.699
so in the Torah,

44:31.741 --> 44:33.951
You are wrong!

44:34.202 --> 44:36.704
Tell me something.

44:36.746 --> 44:39.061
If a widower remarries

44:39.062 --> 44:41.376
seven times,

44:41.418 --> 44:43.504
which wife would greet you

44:43.505 --> 44:45.589
in your afterlife?

44:45.630 --> 44:46.673
The widower's

44:46.674 --> 44:47.715
favorite, of course.

44:47.757 --> 44:50.385
I disagree.

44:51.177 --> 44:54.889
God will decide.

44:54.931 --> 44:56.391
Why cannot all the

44:56.392 --> 44:57.850
wives be there?

45:01.979 --> 45:03.961
You speak so freely and

45:03.962 --> 45:05.942
confidently for one so young.

45:05.983 --> 45:07.485
Tell us your thoughts

45:07.486 --> 45:08.986
on this matter.

45:14.784 --> 45:16.056
Since God loves

45:16.057 --> 45:17.328
all His Children,

45:17.370 --> 45:18.497
I would think all seven of

45:18.498 --> 45:19.623
the widower's wives

45:19.664 --> 45:21.332
- would be accepted
- into his Kingdom.

45:21.374 --> 45:26.754
(murmuring)

45:26.796 --> 45:28.756
- By that logic, are you
- saying that even

45:28.798 --> 45:30.758
- The widower's enemies
- should be accepted

45:30.800 --> 45:31.885
Into the Kingdom

45:31.886 --> 45:32.969
of God?

45:33.010 --> 45:34.575
Shall we not love our enemies

45:34.576 --> 45:36.139
as we love our neighbors?

45:36.180 --> 45:41.769
(murmuring)

45:41.811 --> 45:43.647
Tell us your name.

45:44.689 --> 45:46.650
Jesus.

45:46.691 --> 45:48.401
Jesus of Nazareth.

45:49.819 --> 45:51.088
<i>- Joseph: A thousand
- pardons, Rabbis.</i>

45:55.116 --> 45:56.284
Where have you been?

45:56.326 --> 45:58.095
- Your father and I have
- been anxiously searching

45:58.119 --> 45:59.787
For you.

45:59.829 --> 46:01.310
Why were you

46:01.311 --> 46:02.790
searching for me?

46:02.832 --> 46:05.314
Did you not know I had to

46:05.315 --> 46:07.795
be at my Father's house?

46:07.837 --> 46:09.005
- This is not
- our house.

46:09.046 --> 46:10.715
Passover has finished.

46:10.756 --> 46:12.091
We must journey home.

46:12.133 --> 46:13.384
Of course, Father.

46:13.426 --> 46:14.720
Apologies for the

46:14.721 --> 46:16.012
interruption.

46:21.851 --> 46:23.520
- Jesus, we were
- so worried.

46:23.561 --> 46:24.646
Sorry, father.

46:24.688 --> 46:26.523
<i>Elijah: Joseph?</i>

46:26.856 --> 46:27.691
<i>Mary?</i>

46:27.732 --> 46:29.275
Elijah?

46:32.529 --> 46:33.821
- It has been
- so long.

46:33.863 --> 46:35.031
Where have you been?

46:35.072 --> 46:36.199
Where have I been?

46:36.240 --> 46:37.450
Where have you been?

46:37.492 --> 46:39.161
When you disappeared I

46:39.162 --> 46:40.828
was so worried.

46:40.870 --> 46:42.622
- We were in Egypt
- for a while,

46:42.664 --> 46:44.249
But we've been back in

46:44.250 --> 46:45.833
Nazareth for years.

46:45.875 --> 46:46.834
Are you well?

46:46.876 --> 46:49.003
Your farm stands empty.

46:49.045 --> 46:50.943
Mine is rather a long story and

46:50.944 --> 46:52.840
one to be told another day.

46:52.882 --> 46:53.946
Do you have plans

46:53.947 --> 46:55.009
to Nazareth soon?

46:55.051 --> 46:56.344
- Yes, with my
- wife Rebekah.

46:56.386 --> 46:57.136
You remember her?

46:57.178 --> 46:58.262
Of course.

46:58.304 --> 46:59.847
- It will be nice
- to see her again.

46:59.889 --> 47:01.849
- She'll be happy to
- see you as well.

47:01.891 --> 47:02.892
We've been staying in

47:02.893 --> 47:03.893
Jerusalem with her uncle.

47:03.934 --> 47:05.353
- But with his recent
- passing,

47:05.395 --> 47:06.438
We are making plans to

47:06.439 --> 47:07.480
return to Nazareth.

47:07.522 --> 47:08.690
We are sorry to hear

47:08.691 --> 47:09.857
of your loss

47:09.899 --> 47:11.297
but it will be good to have

47:11.298 --> 47:12.694
you back home again.

47:12.736 --> 47:14.300
Tell us, have you been

47:14.301 --> 47:15.863
blessed with children?

47:15.905 --> 47:17.741
Sadly not as yet.

47:17.782 --> 47:18.866
Your son has grown!

47:18.908 --> 47:20.868
- I can hardly believe this
- is the same Jesus

47:20.910 --> 47:22.495
- I held once in
- my arms.

47:22.537 --> 47:23.788
- How old is
- he now?

47:23.829 --> 47:24.789
12 years.

47:24.830 --> 47:25.891
- Time has passed
- so quickly,

47:25.915 --> 47:27.709
- We can scarcely
- believe it ourselves.

47:27.751 --> 47:29.102
- Well he certainly
- delighted the temple

47:29.126 --> 47:30.316
With his original

47:30.317 --> 47:31.504
way of thinking

47:31.546 --> 47:32.610
<i>Does he have plans</i>

47:32.611 --> 47:33.673
<i>to become a Rabbi?</i>

47:34.801 --> 47:35.883
will.

Well, we look forward to

47:37.219 --> 47:38.511
seeing you back home.

47:38.553 --> 47:40.471

48:02.952 --> 48:04.371
Sorry, I keep thinking

48:04.372 --> 48:05.789
about something

48:05.830 --> 48:06.831
Herod said to me

48:06.832 --> 48:07.832
a long time ago.

48:09.751 --> 48:10.981
Do not speak of

48:10.982 --> 48:12.211
that madman to me.

48:12.253 --> 48:13.672
Nothing he said or

48:13.673 --> 48:15.089
did ever made sense.

48:15.131 --> 48:16.924
You're right.

48:16.966 --> 48:18.444

- back to Nazareth

48:18.468 --> 48:20.199

This is our

49:03.910 --> 49:05.306

49:18.486 --> 49:20.217
What with her

49:20.218 --> 49:21.947
uncle's passing.

49:23.032 --> 49:25.159
The truth is her grief

49:25.160 --> 49:27.286
runs much deeper.

49:27.328 --> 49:28.475
Twelve years ago,

49:28.476 --> 49:29.622
her father

49:29.664 --> 49:31.333
and two boys were slaughtered

49:31.334 --> 49:33.000
by Herod's men.

49:33.042 --> 49:34.982
It's become our life's mission

49:34.983 --> 49:36.921
to find the soldier responsible

49:36.962 --> 49:39.256
and avenge their deaths.

49:39.298 --> 49:40.738
Seeing your son is

49:40.739 --> 49:42.176
just a reminder

49:42.218 --> 49:43.928
of how old her boys

49:43.929 --> 49:45.638
would have been.

49:51.435 --> 49:53.063
But I am glad, as I am

49:53.064 --> 49:54.689
sure my wife is as well

49:54.731 --> 49:56.400

49:56.401 --> 49:58.067
survived the slaughter.

50:06.744 --> 50:08.244

50:08.285 --> 50:09.370
Herod's arms were

50:09.371 --> 50:10.454
long that day.

Your son warms my heart

Come, these

are for you.

Where was the

There were several,

50:45.782 --> 50:47.429
In Betharamptha and more

50:49.118 --> 50:51.600
The Publican was killed by

50:51.601 --> 50:54.081

I cannot lose favour

50:55.605 --> 50:57.084

- pay their taxes

And stop challenging

50:59.984 --> 51:01.046
the Romans.

Collect the money and debts

51:17.981 --> 51:19.189
that are owed to me.

51:19.231 --> 51:20.816

Alright son, now go grab some

51:33.498 --> 51:34.998
of the twigs over there.

51:35.039 --> 51:39.064
We need to stuff them underneath

51:39.065 --> 51:43.088
the larger pieces of wood.

There we go.

52:00.023 --> 52:01.692
It does not

52:01.693 --> 52:03.359
seem fair.

52:03.400 --> 52:05.486
I know I should not covet

52:05.487 --> 52:07.571
from my neighbor,

52:09.116 --> 52:10.616
envy for what they have.

53:48.798 --> 53:49.966
No.

53:50.716 --> 53:52.156
But my Heavenly Father

53:52.157 --> 53:53.594
forgives us of our sins.

53:53.970 --> 53:55.638
No he does not.

53:55.679 --> 53:56.680
It is clearly written

53:56.681 --> 53:57.681
in the scriptures

53:57.723 --> 53:59.496
that God shows no

53:59.497 --> 54:01.268
mercy to the guilty.

54:01.310 --> 54:02.374
But He sends rain and

54:02.375 --> 54:03.437
feeds both the righteous

54:03.479 --> 54:05.272
- and the unrighteous,
- does He not?

54:05.314 --> 54:06.482
That is different.

54:06.523 --> 54:07.984
Who is teaching you such

54:07.985 --> 54:09.443
blasphemous thoughts?

54:09.485 --> 54:12.446
My Father, of course.

54:12.488 --> 54:13.885
I will have a word

54:13.886 --> 54:15.282
with Joseph.

54:15.324 --> 54:16.742
You are mistaken.

54:16.784 --> 54:18.285
- I did not mean
- Joseph.

54:18.327 --> 54:20.287
- I meant my

What did you say?

54:21.580 --> 54:25.292
My Heavenly Father.

54:25.334 --> 54:27.294
Be careful, Jesus.

54:27.336 --> 54:29.296
- Talk like this will
- get you into trouble.

54:29.338 --> 54:31.653
You speak of our Lord as

54:31.654 --> 54:33.968
if He were your very own.

54:38.973 --> 54:40.433
It seems we are at the

54:40.434 --> 54:41.892
crossroads, Rabbi.

Are you coming

54:43.625 --> 54:45.312

Not this time.

54:50.776 --> 54:52.695

Come.

It's okay.

I cannot.

56:54.984 --> 56:56.652
- What are you

56:56.693 --> 56:58.258
My Son is just doing

Offering a hand of kindness

57:01.596 --> 57:03.326

Have I offended

you, woman?

- Why do you stare
- at me so?

57:21.010 --> 57:22.845
Have care.

57:22.886 --> 57:25.160
This is our new

Come, let us

You're trembling.

57:39.611 --> 57:41.197
- Who was that
- man to you?

57:41.238 --> 57:42.594
That man is the reason that I

57:42.595 --> 57:43.949
don't have any children.

57:43.991 --> 57:45.575
- And that I likely
- never will.

57:45.617 --> 57:47.057
That man killed

57:47.058 --> 57:48.495
my boys.

57:48.537 --> 57:49.788
I must go.

57:55.627 --> 57:56.962

- The man who sleighed my boys,
- the new Publican.

58:26.033 --> 58:27.719
- Eligah, he's here, he's
- here in Nazareth

58:27.743 --> 58:28.744
Go, go, kill him.

He's here?

How do you know this

Tiberius is the one?

I would not forget

58:33.834 --> 58:34.917
that face.

Or those eyes.

58:35.751 --> 58:36.960
Or that voice.

58:37.002 --> 58:38.421
He bears the scar

58:38.422 --> 58:39.838
that I left upon him.

58:41.048 --> 58:42.466
- Did you not

Rabbi, may I ask

59:02.550 --> 59:04.447
you something?

Certainly, how

59:07.451 --> 59:10.411
can I help you?

59:10.453 --> 59:13.018
I need the advice of

59:13.019 --> 59:15.582
a more learned Rabbi.

59:15.624 --> 59:17.605
If the Messiah were born

59:17.606 --> 59:19.586
today, how would we know?

59:19.628 --> 59:20.650
How would He

59:20.651 --> 59:21.671
present Himself?

59:21.713 --> 59:23.590
Micah's prophecy?

59:25.259 --> 59:26.593
That's interesting.

59:26.635 --> 59:28.157
I believe you would know in your

59:28.158 --> 59:29.679
heart if you laid eyes upon Him.

59:29.721 --> 59:30.868
What if your heart

59:30.869 --> 59:32.015
is telling you one thing

59:32.057 --> 59:33.683
- but your head is
- telling you another?

59:33.725 --> 59:35.519
- Why are you so
- interested?

59:35.560 --> 59:36.624
Has something

59:36.625 --> 59:37.687
come to pass?

59:39.106 --> 59:40.754
If for example a child were

59:40.755 --> 59:42.401
born with a wisdom

59:42.443 --> 59:43.819
and clarity beyond His years,

59:43.820 --> 59:45.195
in Bethlehem under

59:45.237 --> 59:46.718
the brightest of stars,

59:46.719 --> 59:48.198
would that be enough?

59:48.240 --> 59:49.930
Possibly, it meets the

59:49.931 --> 59:51.618
prophecy's criteria.

59:51.660 --> 59:53.037
But the bigger question

59:53.038 --> 59:54.413
is how do you feel

59:54.455 --> 59:55.498
when you are

59:55.499 --> 59:56.540
with him?

59:56.581 --> 59:57.728
If it were true I

59:57.729 --> 59:58.875
would say

59:58.917 --> 01:00:00.419
that my eyes have seen it

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.920
and my heart has felt it.

01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:06.634
When I am with Him I feel the

01:00:06.635 --> 01:00:08.677
pure grace of God all around me.

01:00:11.972 --> 01:00:13.057

most pleasant visit?

the Magi, and I lied to him.

01:02:10.966 --> 01:02:13.698

01:05:16.485 --> 01:05:18.195
Perhaps it is best to turn

01:05:18.196 --> 01:05:19.904
the other cheek, Elijah.

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:23.179
Elijah, you don't

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.367
have to do this.

01:05:24.409 --> 01:05:25.432
This does not

01:05:25.433 --> 01:05:26.453
concern you.

01:05:26.495 --> 01:05:28.560
Killing Tiberius will not

01:05:28.561 --> 01:05:30.624
bring back the boys.

01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:33.189
Rebekah told Mary that

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:34.544
Tiberius killed her children.

01:05:34.586 --> 01:05:35.671
Then you understand

01:05:35.672 --> 01:05:36.755
what I must do,

01:05:36.797 --> 01:05:37.903
what any man

01:05:37.904 --> 01:05:39.007
must do.

01:05:39.048 --> 01:05:40.843
You are my friend.

01:05:40.884 --> 01:05:42.032
I am deeply concerned

01:05:42.033 --> 01:05:43.178
for your salvation.

01:05:43.219 --> 01:05:44.742
I am correcting a wrong

01:05:44.743 --> 01:05:46.264
according to scripture.

01:05:46.306 --> 01:05:47.641
Or do you not subscribe

01:05:47.642 --> 01:05:48.975
to them anymore?

01:05:49.017 --> 01:05:50.644
Your inner peace can only

01:05:50.645 --> 01:05:52.270
come from forgiveness.

01:05:52.312 --> 01:05:53.772
Forgiveness?!

01:05:53.814 --> 01:05:55.583
- Should welcome this
- murderer into my house

01:05:55.607 --> 01:05:56.983
With open arms?

01:05:57.025 --> 01:05:59.361
Of course not.

01:05:59.402 --> 01:06:00.987
- But I have
- to say this.

01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:02.051
You do not have

01:06:02.052 --> 01:06:03.072
slay your enemy.

01:06:03.114 --> 01:06:04.157
Pity Tiberius instead.

01:06:04.199 --> 01:06:05.284
And let the hand

01:06:05.285 --> 01:06:06.368
of God tend to him.

01:06:06.409 --> 01:06:08.182
And who took pity

01:06:08.183 --> 01:06:09.954
on Rebekah's boys?

Is there something I

01:07:06.992 --> 01:07:08.054
can help you with?

01:07:08.096 --> 01:07:10.098
I have come to

01:07:10.099 --> 01:07:12.100
collect your taxes.

01:07:12.141 --> 01:07:13.519
My King does not

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.895
tolerate tardiness.

01:07:15.896 --> 01:07:16.981

You better have

01:07:19.588 --> 01:07:21.067
it ready for me.

01:07:31.578 --> 01:07:33.872
Aaron, it has been far too

01:07:33.873 --> 01:07:36.165
long since our last visit.

01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:38.231
I am well

enough, but...

01:07:39.962 --> 01:07:43.799
<i>It is Elijah.</i>

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.174
- I sense a
- change in him,

01:07:45.216 --> 01:07:46.718
And I know not what it

01:07:46.719 --> 01:07:48.219
is but it nags at me.

01:07:50.138 --> 01:07:51.536
Perhaps he is not strong

01:07:51.537 --> 01:07:52.933
enough to do this.

01:07:54.183 --> 01:07:56.645
But if he cannot or will not

01:07:56.646 --> 01:07:59.105
seek retribution for our boys,

01:07:59.147 --> 01:08:00.461
I promise you

01:08:00.462 --> 01:08:01.775
that I will.

Father, you're back!

01:08:54.202 --> 01:08:55.161
Hello Jesus.

01:08:55.203 --> 01:08:57.393
Joseph, the publican

01:08:57.394 --> 01:08:59.582
came by earlier.

01:08:59.624 --> 01:09:01.334
He'll be back later.

01:09:01.376 --> 01:09:03.169
- Are you and

01:09:03.211 --> 01:09:06.673
Yes, yes we're fine.

01:09:07.256 --> 01:09:08.966
- But you don't
- look well.

01:09:09.009 --> 01:09:10.218
- Joseph, you
- need to rest.

01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:12.178
- You've been working
- tirelessly.

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.846
I just have to finish fixing

01:09:13.848 --> 01:09:15.473
the door and then I will rest.

01:09:15.515 --> 01:09:16.515
I promise.

01:09:16.558 --> 01:09:18.142
- Please, father,

01:09:22.022 --> 01:09:23.689
Okay son.

01:09:31.656 --> 01:09:33.930
I'll take this respite but

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:36.202
I have much work to do.

01:09:36.243 --> 01:09:37.453
I promised Elijah that I would

01:09:37.455 --> 01:09:38.662
help mend his fence.

01:09:38.705 --> 01:09:40.040
The fence can wait.

01:09:40.082 --> 01:09:42.166
Elijah will understand.

01:09:42.959 --> 01:09:44.732
I hate that I am

01:09:44.733 --> 01:09:46.504
a burden to you.

01:09:47.964 --> 01:09:50.613
Stubborn perhaps,

01:09:50.613 --> 01:09:53.261
but never a burden.

01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:55.471
Now rest while I make

01:09:55.472 --> 01:09:57.640
you something to eat.

01:10:04.898 --> 01:10:05.398
Take heed!

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.524
What happened?

01:10:06.566 --> 01:10:07.919
- The new publican will
- not be trifled with.

01:10:07.943 --> 01:10:09.403
We should just pay him and

01:10:09.404 --> 01:10:10.862
then he will leave us alone.

01:10:10.904 --> 01:10:12.113
No, the more we pay,

01:10:12.114 --> 01:10:13.322
the more he will demand.

01:10:13.364 --> 01:10:14.323
I say we fight!

01:10:14.365 --> 01:10:16.242
- Where is he, where
- is the Publican?

01:10:16.284 --> 01:10:17.284
He went west.

01:10:17.577 --> 01:10:18.954
It will not end.

01:10:18.995 --> 01:10:20.039
How much more blood

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.081

Tell me, Rebekah, have you

01:13:02.848 --> 01:13:05.245
ever lived in Jerusalem?

01:13:05.287 --> 01:13:06.684
Because you look very much like

I'm sorry, I won't be able to

protect you any longer.

01:18:39.787 --> 01:18:41.998
You must leave your mother and

your Uncle Joseph of Arimathea.

01:18:58.933 --> 01:19:00.141
I return?

Your Father in Heaven

01:19:01.935 --> 01:19:03.686
will guide you.

01:19:03.727 --> 01:19:06.606

I want you to know

01:19:54.445 --> 01:19:57.260

01:19:57.261 --> 01:20:00.075
moment I layed my eyes upon you.

01:20:00.117 --> 01:20:02.119
And being your husband

01:20:02.161 --> 01:20:03.496

01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:14.298

Please, please don't

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.177
leave my alone.
