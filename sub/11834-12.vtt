00:01.000 --> 00:02.669
LINDSAY: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.703 --> 00:06.239
We find the defendant
William Hinks not guilty.

00:06.272 --> 00:08.408
Since you are treating him,
I would just like you

00:08.441 --> 00:11.044
to prevail upon him
not to stalk me anymore.

00:11.077 --> 00:13.046
I can't promise
I'll be effective,

00:13.079 --> 00:14.781
but I'll certainly try.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.583
Jean Reynolds
had a heart attack.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.351
What? I don't care
what the doctor said.

00:18.384 --> 00:21.087
A woman in her 30s doesn't
just suddenly turn up dead.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.423
-It was William Hinks.
-He scared her
into having a coronary?

00:23.456 --> 00:26.192
-At least order an autopsy.
-Lindsay, you were right.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.461
She was injected
with liquid nicotine.

00:28.494 --> 00:31.397
-It simulated all the
conditions of a heart attack.
-So she was murdered.

00:31.431 --> 00:33.734
I want to know where
you were two nights ago.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.336
I believe I was home alone
watching "Taxi."

00:36.369 --> 00:37.671
You think that's funny,
William?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.405
While the joke
could be lost on you,

00:39.439 --> 00:41.675
I'm sure Lindsay is about
to find herself in stitches.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.143
She's being threatened,

00:43.176 --> 00:45.278
and her life
could very well be in danger.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.113
$50,000 cash up-front.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.850
I'm not hiring you to --

00:49.883 --> 00:52.653
I just want you to scare him.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.390
I'll take care of it,
Bobby.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.367
Hinks?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.802
Yeah.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.738
Where's his head?

01:22.849 --> 01:24.651
You have any suspects?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.653
Not yet.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.883
I asked for my lawyer.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.686
This is Bernard Shanly.
He's a public defender.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.755
I don't want a public defender.
I asked for Bobby Donnell.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.890
Mr. Neel, I'm going to
advise you to just listen now--

02:03.924 --> 02:05.491
You listen. Beat it.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.627
Shut up, Alan,

02:06.660 --> 02:08.729
and just don't talk
for a second.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.738
You have a problem, Alan.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.741
The man you killed
was a bit of a security freak.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.375
He had cameras.

02:22.408 --> 02:25.211
One of them picked you up
entering his house.

02:25.245 --> 02:28.715
He also managed
to activate his phone machine,

02:28.749 --> 02:31.885
which partially recorded
an exchange between you two.

02:31.918 --> 02:34.755
ALAN: You picked
the wrong girl to terrorize.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.924
Bobby Donnell
is a friend of mine.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.593
We got kind of
an arrangement going.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.962
I kill people.
He gets me off.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.798
Over the years,
I'm in his debt pretty good,

02:44.831 --> 02:46.232
so when he calls in
a favor --

02:46.266 --> 02:48.301
WILLIAM:
I have a silent alarm.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.538
The police are on their way
as I speak.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.406
Then I'd better not
waste time.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.775
Before you touch me,
you should know --

02:54.808 --> 02:56.409
I have cooties.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.411
ALAN:
Well, you're a funny boy.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.680
WILLIAM: Please!

02:59.713 --> 03:02.683
(choking sounds)

03:05.519 --> 03:07.821
-(beep)
-WOMAN: You have
exceeded the time --

03:07.854 --> 03:08.889
(tape recorder clicks off)

03:08.922 --> 03:10.524
You see, Alan?

03:10.557 --> 03:12.526
I don't think Bobby Donnell

03:12.559 --> 03:15.629
is the lawyer
you want to be calling.

03:19.566 --> 03:21.868
â™ª (theme)

04:10.350 --> 04:12.452
-Did you feel that?
-Ooh, I felt it.

04:12.485 --> 04:13.554
-I didn't.
-You didn't feel that?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.488
Oh, come on.

04:15.522 --> 04:16.757
What about that?

04:16.790 --> 04:17.958
That I felt.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.492
Is that normal?

04:19.526 --> 04:20.761
ELLENOR: Hey, Jimmy,
how come you never ask

04:20.793 --> 04:22.295
to feel my stomach?

04:22.328 --> 04:24.030
Oh, don't start with me,
Ellenor.

04:24.064 --> 04:27.568
Bobby, Alan Neel.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.002
What about him?

04:29.035 --> 04:32.038
He's been arrested
for William Hinks' murder.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.977
Arrested when?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.979
Last night.
They got him in lockup.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.847
He's being arraigned
at 9:00.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.431
Privacy.

05:02.669 --> 05:05.105
-Bobby --
-Calm down.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.008
-Bobby, they know.
They got it on tape.
-Keep your voice down.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.410
-He had some
recorder thing going.
-Who?

05:10.443 --> 05:13.479
-Hinks. The guy
you had me whack.
-Hey, I didn't have you --

05:13.514 --> 05:16.983
-They got it on tape!
-Alan, calm down.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.753
They want me to turn state
against you.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.888
What?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.124
They got me on tape,
how, you know, you sent me --

05:24.157 --> 05:26.426
-Who wants you to turn state?
-The cops...

05:26.459 --> 05:27.928
and that midget D. A.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.696
Bobby, they got us both.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.898
What exactly
do they have on tape?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.835
Me telling Hinks
that you sent me.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.102
All right, first,

05:36.136 --> 05:38.639
I never sent you
to kill him.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.741
-Oh, come on.
-I said scare him.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.676
-Now come on, Bobby.
-I never said --

05:42.709 --> 05:44.044
Look, we're in deep here.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.779
If you're going to
turn against me --

05:45.812 --> 05:47.514
I'm not turning
against you, I'm just --

05:47.548 --> 05:49.516
Okay, okay.
We need each other.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.051
We're in trouble,
so, look,

05:51.084 --> 05:53.053
let's just get
on the same page here

05:53.086 --> 05:55.689
and admit that you had me
kill the guy.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.794
What?

06:03.530 --> 06:07.668
I did not
have you kill him.

06:10.003 --> 06:13.707
I'll be seeing you, Alan.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.647
Guard!

06:28.722 --> 06:30.891
Bobby Donnell...

06:30.924 --> 06:32.458
What's going on?

06:32.492 --> 06:34.628
I'm sorry.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.630
Mike.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.065
You're under arrest
for the murder of William Hinks.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.802
You have the right
to remain silent.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.170
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

06:44.204 --> 06:45.739
in a court of law.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.741
You have the right
to an attorney.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.743
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

06:49.776 --> 06:51.778
one will be provided for you.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.020
What?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.454
It just happened.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.455
He's being arraigned
this afternoon.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.157
-I'm on my way.
-I'm going, too.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.191
-No, Lindsay --
-He's my husband.
I'm certainly entitled to --

07:05.225 --> 07:06.593
you're seven months
pregnant.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.028
-So what? Ellenor.
-He's right, Lindsay.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.597
You don't want to stress
yourself into miscarrying.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.733
Stay here.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.002
I'll call you.
Jimmy, come on.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.610
Karen?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.746
Hey, Bec.
Can I talk to you?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.649
Well, sure.
Is everything okay?

07:28.682 --> 07:31.718
I think I'd like to hire you.
Are you free?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.486
Let's go in here.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.988
It's their fault,
Rebecca.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.489
Why shouldn't they
take responsibility?

07:36.523 --> 07:37.924
I'm a widow
because of them.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.660
Maybe they should,

07:39.693 --> 07:42.162
but to hold an employer liable
for an employee's suicide --

07:42.195 --> 07:45.265
They worked him so hard.
They verbally abused him.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.568
Law firms push associates
all the time.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.503
They all work long hours.

07:49.536 --> 07:50.937
This went beyond that.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.174
We both know Keith suffered
from depression.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.842
Which they were
responsible for.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.678
Well, did any doctor
say that?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.980
Look, Rebecca,
you're my friend.

08:00.013 --> 08:00.981
If you won't help me --

08:01.014 --> 08:02.749
Of course I'll help you.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.751
I'm just saying
that your husband suffered

08:04.785 --> 08:06.152
from a pre-existing
mental --

08:06.186 --> 08:08.121
That law firm
drove him to suicide,

08:08.154 --> 08:10.056
and I want to sue them.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.058
Was it foreseeable to you

08:12.092 --> 08:15.128
that Keith was going to
take his life?

08:15.161 --> 08:18.532
No.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.066
Then how do we really argue

08:20.100 --> 08:22.536
it should have been
foreseeable to them?

08:22.569 --> 08:23.537
Please...

08:23.570 --> 08:25.138
I just need to do this.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.308
They --

08:28.341 --> 08:31.077
I need your help.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.815
All right,
let me set up a meeting.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.116
I'd like to file
a complaint

08:36.149 --> 08:37.317
contemporaneously
with the meeting,

08:37.350 --> 08:38.318
let them know
we're serious about this.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.053
First let me meet --

08:40.086 --> 08:41.788
No. Just file
the complaint,

08:41.822 --> 08:44.691
then we'll meet with them
and go from there. Please?

08:44.725 --> 08:48.261
It can just be boilerplate,
but it'll send a message.

08:48.294 --> 08:52.098
Okay, but I have to
tell you, Karen,

08:52.132 --> 08:54.267
I'm only doing this
out of our friendship.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.169
As a lawyer,

08:56.202 --> 08:59.172
I don't see much merit
in this case.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.842
They killed him, Rebecca.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.579
They drove him
to take his life.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.253
I guess they're going
solicitation.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.189
I kind of went into shock
when he was reading me.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.924
Wait a second.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.360
Alan Neel
really did kill Hinks?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.362
Yes.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.765
And how did they
connect it to you?

09:24.798 --> 09:29.302
I met with Alan
the night before.

09:29.335 --> 09:32.272
I told him to scare Hinks.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.042
What do you mean,
you told him to scare him?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.377
-I just--
-Scare Hinks?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.312
Yes, Hinks.

09:39.345 --> 09:42.148
He killed his shrink,
he was threatening Lindsay.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.318
I told Alan to put
the fear of God in him.

09:45.351 --> 09:48.689
And now Alan is
evidently claiming

09:48.722 --> 09:52.192
that I asked him
to kill Hinks.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.927
He was wearing a wire.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.396
I think he's made
some kind of deal,

09:56.429 --> 10:00.233
and now they're after me.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.102
They're after me.

10:09.309 --> 10:14.214
Case 32899, Commonwealth vs
Robert Donnell.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.916
Breaking and entering

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
with intent
to commit felonious assault,

10:17.984 --> 10:21.922
conspiracy to commit murder
and felony murder,

10:21.955 --> 10:24.925
and murder in the first degree.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.693
Eugene Young
for the defendant.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.929
We enter a plea
of not guilty on all counts.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.230
I also ask that my client

10:30.263 --> 10:32.232
be released
on his own recognizance.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.834
Given the severity
of the charges,

10:33.867 --> 10:35.702
the Commonwealth opposes bail.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.270
He's not a flight risk,
nor is he a threat to society.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.705
Unless you get him mad.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.173
I don't find that funny.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.810
Obviously, Mr. Donnell has
strong roots in the community.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.712
He's a respected member
of the bar --

10:45.746 --> 10:47.981
I don't know to which bar
my colleague is referring.

10:48.014 --> 10:51.852
I'm setting bail at $100,000,
$10,000 bond.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.920
Let's conference later
for a trial date.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.723
Anything else?

10:56.757 --> 10:59.660
-Adjourned.
-(bangs gavel)

11:02.763 --> 11:05.799
We'll get the bail posted.
It'll take about an hour.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.068
Okay. Hey.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.270
-You okay?
-Yeah.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.938
We got to take him.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.840
-I'm going with him.
-I don't think
that would be --

11:13.874 --> 11:16.843
Don't think, then.
I'm going.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.278
You hear the counts?

11:18.311 --> 11:19.445
Yeah.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.948
They're not just going
solicitation.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.250
They're charging first degree.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.057
Okay. 4:00.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.726
I appreciate that.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.260
Thank you. See you then.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.064
There's a surprise.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.733
He's coming here.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.001
Who?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.435
The managing partner

11:42.468 --> 11:44.104
of the law firm
Karen wants me to sue.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.373
Rebecca, don't get me wrong.
I love the underdog, but --

11:47.407 --> 11:50.076
She's a friend.
She wants to do it.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.445
Maybe I can scare up
some nuisance change.

11:52.478 --> 11:53.947
Who knows?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.058
How'd it go?

12:08.461 --> 12:12.799
Obviously it all comes down
to the credibility of Mr. Neel.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.335
The reason
for this assemblage --

12:15.368 --> 12:18.338
I do not want this one
slipping away.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.174
Robert Donnell is an enemy
to this department.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.510
Three years ago,
he tipped off his drug clients

12:23.544 --> 12:25.245
to an upcoming police raid,

12:25.278 --> 12:27.881
which led to the shooting death
of two officers.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.450
He has routinely manipulated
the judicial process

12:30.483 --> 12:33.053
to prevent murderers
from being incarcerated,

12:33.086 --> 12:35.522
and he has embarrassed us all
while doing so.

12:35.556 --> 12:38.458
As far as this office
is concerned,

12:38.491 --> 12:40.193
this prosecution is payback.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.162
Now, you will all be assigned
specific roles --

12:42.195 --> 12:43.997
Excuse me.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.532
Yes?

12:45.566 --> 12:48.535
Nobody wants to beat
Bobby Donnell more than I do,

12:48.569 --> 12:51.104
but this thing
being politicized...

12:51.137 --> 12:52.806
I beg your pardon?

12:52.839 --> 12:57.410
It's one thing to charge him
on the facts of this case,

12:57.443 --> 12:58.945
but his previous history
with the department

12:58.979 --> 13:01.447
should have no bearing
on this prosecution,

13:01.481 --> 13:03.449
and I think
a departmental vendetta --

13:03.483 --> 13:04.585
That's not what this is.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.954
It sure sounds like it.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.489
Bobby Donnell's
previous history

13:09.523 --> 13:11.858
with this department
is only relevant

13:11.892 --> 13:14.861
to the extent that it will be
played up in the press.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.130
Given the added attention
to this case,

13:17.163 --> 13:19.399
I'm concerned from
a public relations standpoint,

13:19.432 --> 13:21.502
and therefore
I think it's important

13:21.535 --> 13:24.170
that we all do a good job.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.206
That's not what you said,
Martin.

13:26.239 --> 13:29.442
That's what I'm saying now,
Richard.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.879
May I continue?

13:38.084 --> 13:41.387
Why didn't you tell me?

13:41.421 --> 13:43.089
Please don't start.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.291
I'm not trying
to start, Bobby,

13:45.325 --> 13:48.161
but you bring
this Neel guy in,

13:48.194 --> 13:50.363
you tell him to scare Hinks,
Hinks ends up dead,

13:50.396 --> 13:52.398
and you say nothing to me?

13:52.432 --> 13:55.201
It had to have been
eating you.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.139
(door opens)

13:59.172 --> 14:01.374
EUGENE: Could I have
a second with him?

14:01.407 --> 14:04.410
Sure. Why should I know
what the hell is going on?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.446
I'm only married to him.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.326
They're giving Neel
manslaughter --

14:20.360 --> 14:21.995
20 years.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.665
In exchange
for his testimony against me?

14:24.698 --> 14:28.935
Yeah. I'm bringing a motion
to kick a couple of counts,

14:28.969 --> 14:30.537
the most serious
being felony murder.

14:30.571 --> 14:33.006
That's where
you're the most vulnerable.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.508
Felony murder?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.143
How can they charge that?

14:37.177 --> 14:39.012
Breaking and entering.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.548
Oh, please.
That can't stand.

14:41.582 --> 14:42.983
Well, if it does,
you're in trouble,

14:43.016 --> 14:44.450
and I don't need
to tell you that.

14:47.588 --> 14:51.424
I'm going to say this once
because I have to say it once,

14:51.457 --> 14:53.359
then I'll move on.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.563
Your sending a known criminal,
a murderer, no less,

14:56.597 --> 14:58.364
to visit Hinks

14:58.398 --> 15:01.301
was perhaps the dumbest thing
I've ever known you to do.

15:01.334 --> 15:05.038
You put yourself at risk,
you jeopardized this firm.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.174
Now, I know you were acting
as a worried husband,

15:08.208 --> 15:11.011
but, Bobby,
if stupidity were a crime,

15:11.044 --> 15:13.514
your ass
would be serving life.

15:17.317 --> 15:21.722
Now, let's turn
to your defense.

15:21.755 --> 15:25.592
Before we get to that,
Eugene...

15:25.626 --> 15:27.661
I'm about to have a baby.

15:27.694 --> 15:31.064
I'm going on trial for murder.

15:31.097 --> 15:35.468
I'm in no position...

15:35.502 --> 15:39.606
I should say condition,
to be running this firm.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.577
I won't be
till this thing is over.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.079
I'm appointing you
pro tem senior partner.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.748
We don't need
to talk about that.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.983
Yes, we do.

15:50.016 --> 15:54.387
This firm, more than ever,
needs strong leadership.

15:56.189 --> 16:00.226
And at the moment...

16:00.260 --> 16:01.461
I can't provide it.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.098
I'm not passing
on a title here,

16:05.131 --> 16:09.302
I'm just...
assigning responsibility.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.508
Okay.

16:17.611 --> 16:19.445
I worked
all the associates.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.381
We were doing
massive class actions.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.383
You worked Keith
in a way --

16:23.416 --> 16:26.119
Karen. Mr. Bannish,
I obviously know what it's like

16:26.152 --> 16:27.487
to work in a law firm.

16:27.521 --> 16:29.389
Can I stop you there,
Ms. Washington?

16:29.422 --> 16:30.657
With all due respect
to your practice,

16:30.691 --> 16:32.225
you have no experience

16:32.258 --> 16:33.660
with class-action
product liability work.

16:33.694 --> 16:36.229
Keith was on
a toxic waste case

16:36.262 --> 16:38.565
involving 3,200 plaintiffs.
This kind of --

16:38.599 --> 16:41.134
I understand that,
and I know associates

16:41.167 --> 16:43.504
are expected
to put in long hours,

16:43.537 --> 16:46.039
but you also know, sir,
the Eggshell Doctrine and --

16:46.072 --> 16:47.407
Meaning?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.676
Meaning you take your plaintiffs
as you find them,

16:49.710 --> 16:51.344
and the fact that Keith had

16:51.377 --> 16:53.246
an underlying
psychological condition

16:53.279 --> 16:54.314
is not a complete defense.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.783
Look...

16:56.817 --> 16:58.585
I loved Keith.

16:58.619 --> 17:00.320
Oh, please.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.623
Whether you want
to believe that, Karen, I did,

17:02.656 --> 17:04.790
and his death was shocking
to all of us,

17:04.825 --> 17:06.792
but we never, ever
verbally abused him.

17:06.827 --> 17:09.061
Did you call him
at 1:00 in the morning?

17:09.095 --> 17:10.631
Yes, but that's the job.

17:10.664 --> 17:12.432
He asked for time off

17:12.464 --> 17:14.800
the week before his death.
You wouldn't even --

17:14.835 --> 17:17.503
It was also a week
before the trial. I couldn't.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.506
All right, look,
Mr. Bannish,

17:19.540 --> 17:21.541
we're not blaming you
for Keith's death.

17:21.575 --> 17:23.577
I am.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.712
Karen.

17:25.746 --> 17:27.647
We're merely saying

17:27.681 --> 17:30.283
a lot of factors
came into play.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.653
The pressure of work,
the long hours --

17:32.686 --> 17:34.821
those were some
of the factors.

17:34.855 --> 17:38.491
We're suggesting
you take some responsibility.

17:42.863 --> 17:46.332
Richard.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.134
Listen, I thought
about what you said,

17:48.168 --> 17:50.370
and, well, I agree.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.738
It would be wrong
to politicize this.

17:51.772 --> 17:54.374
It's also probably overkill

17:54.407 --> 17:56.743
to assemble a big army
of district attorneys,

17:56.777 --> 17:58.845
so I'm scaling it down.

17:58.879 --> 18:01.848
You're no longer on the case.
We'll have you reassigned.

18:01.882 --> 18:04.551
Thanks for your work
thus far.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.286
I'm off the case

18:06.319 --> 18:08.555
because I don't like
what you're doing?

18:08.589 --> 18:12.526
Again, thank you
for your work to date.

18:21.167 --> 18:24.337
First priority -- We need to
kick the felony murder charge.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.773
If that count stands,
all they really need to prove

18:26.807 --> 18:29.309
is that Bobby sent Neel
to break into Hinks' house.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.779
It's no defense that he didn't
intend for Hinks to be killed.

18:32.813 --> 18:36.149
This count must be dismissed.
Ellenor.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.684
I'm already on it.

18:37.718 --> 18:39.686
Second, privilege.
This is huge.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.688
We have to go after
Neel's credibility.

18:41.722 --> 18:44.691
Unfortunately,
a lot of stuff we have on him

18:44.725 --> 18:46.693
we learned through
attorney/client privilege.

18:46.727 --> 18:49.796
Now we need to be able
to use it. Lindsay?

18:49.830 --> 18:51.431
Got it.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.434
Third, they gave Neel
manslaughter.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.637
I'm not sure you can tag
conspiracy charges

18:56.670 --> 18:57.904
with manslaughter.

18:57.938 --> 18:59.906
Bobby, why don't you
research that?

18:59.940 --> 19:02.208
There's no reason we can't
put you to work.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.177
Thanks.

19:04.210 --> 19:07.714
Fourth...

19:07.748 --> 19:09.315
this firm.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.921
We're in trouble.

19:14.955 --> 19:17.558
We may be a partnership,

19:17.591 --> 19:19.726
but the face of this place
is Bobby.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.394
Even if we beat this,

19:21.427 --> 19:23.396
our reputation
has taken a big hit.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.398
Clients may want to bail on us.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.833
Potential clients will be
less likely to come.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.835
I want to retain a publicist.

19:28.869 --> 19:31.471
That could be expensive,
but we need to do it.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.575
Also, we have two partners
about to have babies.

19:34.608 --> 19:38.411
We need to hire. As of now,
we have a hiring committee.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.980
Ellenor, Lindsay, you co-chair.

19:40.013 --> 19:43.517
Next -- Time sheets.
We do them now.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.720
We have to become
as systemized as we can

19:46.753 --> 19:48.889
because right now clients
will be looking for us

19:48.922 --> 19:51.592
to fall apart.
Disorganization --

19:51.625 --> 19:54.961
any disorganization
will fuel that perception.

19:54.995 --> 19:57.731
Rebecca, Walter Bannish
is here.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.467
Mr. Bannish.

20:01.502 --> 20:03.637
Hello.

20:03.670 --> 20:07.808
Look, I still contest
any liability on our part.

20:07.841 --> 20:10.243
But the negative publicity
of a lawsuit --

20:10.276 --> 20:11.945
I don't want it out there
that we're a sweatshop.

20:11.978 --> 20:15.616
So I'm willing to make
an offer to make this go away.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.718
One-time offer,
take it or leave it.

20:17.751 --> 20:19.620
Okay. What is it?

20:19.653 --> 20:21.655
$500,000.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.626
Payable now?

20:25.659 --> 20:27.928
Payable upon signing
the release, yes,

20:27.961 --> 20:30.997
and a complete
confidentiality agreement.

20:31.031 --> 20:33.934
Well, I will take it
to my client

20:33.967 --> 20:35.569
and let you know tomorrow.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.704
Thank you.

20:37.738 --> 20:38.705
No, thank you.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.340
Good night.

20:49.716 --> 20:50.851
Bec?

20:50.884 --> 20:54.320
You remember
my suicide case --

20:54.354 --> 20:56.857
Wrongful death, no merits?

20:56.890 --> 20:58.525
Yeah. It was your friend.

20:58.559 --> 21:04.430
Nuisance change
just came in -- $500,000.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.933
What?

21:08.869 --> 21:10.571
What are we missing?

21:16.643 --> 21:19.479
I'm not saying the case
against him is bogus.

21:19.513 --> 21:21.715
It isn't, but there's
a lynch mob mentality going on

21:21.748 --> 21:23.349
which is bogus.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.652
They don't really think
Bobby ordered a hit, do they?

21:25.686 --> 21:27.988
It doesn't matter.
They're out to get him,

21:28.021 --> 21:29.523
and they think he was
at least reckless,

21:29.556 --> 21:32.092
which is all
they may need to prove.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.894
-Helen.
-Lindsay.

21:33.927 --> 21:35.529
Make it go away.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.997
Lindsay, I'm not sure --

21:37.030 --> 21:38.431
He's not a murderer.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.367
I'm calling in a favor.
Make it go away.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.436
Lindsay, I can't.
This is upstairs.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.405
Then take the stairs,
Helen.

21:45.438 --> 21:48.341
Do whatever you have to do,
but make it go away.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.827
What?

22:06.860 --> 22:08.995
I'm just looking.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.078
I'm sorry.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.915
He --

22:28.949 --> 22:32.085
I got so afraid that
he really might hurt you,

22:32.118 --> 22:34.655
and the reason
I didn't tell you

22:34.688 --> 22:39.092
is because I knew this is
not the kind of stress

22:39.125 --> 22:40.927
you need right now.

22:40.961 --> 22:44.665
Bobby, I'm your wife.

22:44.698 --> 22:48.869
I know this.

22:56.009 --> 22:57.811
What happens tomorrow?

22:59.713 --> 23:03.049
We have a motion to dismiss
the felony murder count.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.185
If you lose...

23:05.218 --> 23:06.787
Lindsay, their whole case

23:06.820 --> 23:09.155
is the word
of a career criminal.

23:09.189 --> 23:11.792
They can't satisfy
their burden with that.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.393
They just can't.

23:17.631 --> 23:21.602
I've never seen you
look so scared.

23:21.635 --> 23:24.437
We'll beat this, Bobby.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.707
We'll put the whole firm
on it if we have to.

23:41.788 --> 23:44.858
That's fantastic.

23:44.891 --> 23:48.595
Yeah, I thought
you'd be pleased.

23:48.629 --> 23:52.699
Well, I guess he admits
he's responsible after all.

23:52.733 --> 23:54.200
I can't quite believe it,
but --

23:54.234 --> 23:55.836
Thank you so much, Rebecca.

23:55.869 --> 23:59.072
You have no idea how much
I could use this money, too.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.007
And I'll get it today

24:01.041 --> 24:03.043
when I sign
the confidentiality agreement?

24:05.612 --> 24:08.248
I never mentioned
any confidentiality agreement.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.517
How'd you know about that?

24:10.551 --> 24:11.885
Oh, well, I'm assuming.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.920
My husband
was a lawyer, bec.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.889
I know how
these things work.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.124
I'm assuming the settlement
will be sealed.

24:18.158 --> 24:20.126
Well, why don't you
fill me in

24:20.160 --> 24:22.095
on how things work, Karen,

24:22.128 --> 24:24.130
or how they're
working here?

24:24.164 --> 24:26.032
I'm sorry?

24:26.066 --> 24:28.635
Nobody hands over
$500,000 after one meeting.

24:28.669 --> 24:30.203
No discovery, even.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.038
He just says,
"Okay, here's a check."

24:32.072 --> 24:34.174
-What's going on?
-I might ask
the same question.

24:34.207 --> 24:35.642
Don't lie to me.

24:35.676 --> 24:37.811
We've been friends
a long time,

24:37.844 --> 24:39.813
and you tapped
into that friendship

24:39.846 --> 24:41.782
to get me
to represent you here.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.750
Be straight with me, Karen,

24:43.784 --> 24:46.620
or I'll start asking
my questions in other places.

24:56.597 --> 25:00.601
Walter Bannish
embezzled a lot of money

25:00.634 --> 25:02.102
from client trust funds,

25:02.135 --> 25:04.304
and Keith went along
with it.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.206
And his guilt,
I'm convinced,

25:06.239 --> 25:07.708
contributed
to his depression.

25:07.741 --> 25:10.110
I went to Mr. Bannish,
and I accused him

25:10.143 --> 25:12.746
of contributing
to my husband's suicide,

25:12.779 --> 25:14.715
and I wanted
to be compensated.

25:14.748 --> 25:16.883
So why didn't he just
pay you off then?

25:16.917 --> 25:18.885
He said, "It sounds like

25:18.919 --> 25:20.921
"you're accusing me
of wrongful death.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.989
"perhaps you should
sue the firm,

25:23.023 --> 25:24.958
and then we'll settle
the matter."

25:24.991 --> 25:26.059
He needed to be sued

25:26.092 --> 25:27.994
to get his firm
to pay the money,

25:28.028 --> 25:30.063
and that's why you insisted
I draw up a complaint

25:30.096 --> 25:34.701
and file it so he basically
could defraud his own partners.

25:36.637 --> 25:39.139
Karen, this is extortion.
I won't be part of it.

25:39.172 --> 25:40.874
Excuse me, Rebecca,

25:40.907 --> 25:41.875
but you're not a part
of anything

25:41.908 --> 25:43.877
but a legitimate lawsuit.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.179
I went to Mr. Bannish,
and he advised me

25:46.212 --> 25:48.782
I'd have to sue him
before he'd give me a nickel,

25:48.815 --> 25:50.951
and I did sue him,
and we've settled the matter.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.053
You have no evidence
of extortion.

25:53.086 --> 25:56.957
-Karen --
-Please notify Mr. Bannish
I accept his offer.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.263
By the way,

26:03.296 --> 26:05.899
no need to thank me
for the easiest contingency

26:05.932 --> 26:07.668
you've ever earned
in your life.

26:07.701 --> 26:11.371
Over $150,000
for one day's work.

26:11.404 --> 26:14.240
You're welcome.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.685
There is no legal basis

26:24.718 --> 26:26.687
for the charge
of felony murder.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.889
Breaking and entering a dwelling
to commit a felonious assault

26:28.922 --> 26:30.390
is a sufficient predicate
to felony murder.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.058
There's case law --

26:32.092 --> 26:33.760
To charge the person
who did

26:33.794 --> 26:35.328
the actual breaking
and entering.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.263
There is
absolutely no case law

26:37.297 --> 26:39.700
charging the alleged accessory
with felony murder.

26:39.733 --> 26:42.836
Any person can be charged
as an accessory to any felony.

26:42.869 --> 26:45.271
Yes, well, no one ever has
under these circumstances,

26:45.305 --> 26:48.041
and suddenly,
with Bobby Donnell --

26:48.074 --> 26:50.644
Even if Bobby Donnell did not
conspire to kill William Hinks,

26:50.677 --> 26:52.646
he gave Mr. Neel
William Hinks' address

26:52.679 --> 26:54.280
and dispatched him to his home.

26:54.314 --> 26:57.383
Mr. Neel broke into that home.

26:57.417 --> 27:00.053
A murder resulting
from a breaking and entering

27:00.086 --> 27:02.689
is the exact scenario
the legislature had in mind

27:02.723 --> 27:05.058
when passing
the felony murder rule.

27:05.091 --> 27:08.128
There is no evidence
that my client

27:08.161 --> 27:10.130
was a part of any
breaking and entering.

27:10.163 --> 27:12.232
We have a statement
from the actual killer.

27:12.265 --> 27:14.234
That would be considered
evidence.

27:14.267 --> 27:16.803
Your honor, they know
they can't prove this crime.

27:16.837 --> 27:18.304
They can't show intent,

27:18.338 --> 27:20.741
so the prosecution
is charging felony murder

27:20.774 --> 27:22.943
to circumvent
their burden of proof.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.945
Yes, well, unless
I'm missing something,

27:24.978 --> 27:26.947
that is one
of the very reasons

27:26.980 --> 27:28.849
we have
the felony murder rule,

27:28.882 --> 27:31.818
to lower
the prosecution's burden.

27:31.852 --> 27:33.086
If you look
at all the cases

27:33.119 --> 27:34.688
where this rule
has been applied --

27:34.721 --> 27:36.723
The function of the court
is not to look --

27:36.757 --> 27:39.225
There is no predicate felony
to support these charges.

27:39.259 --> 27:41.194
This amounts
to selective prosecution

27:41.227 --> 27:43.296
against a defense attorney
they don't like --

27:43.329 --> 27:46.299
There is absolutely no evidence
of selective prosecution

27:46.332 --> 27:47.934
in this case,

27:47.968 --> 27:51.371
and as for a predicate felony,
you've got several --

27:51.404 --> 27:53.339
Aiding and abetting
a felonious assault,

27:53.373 --> 27:55.408
breaking and entering --

27:55.441 --> 27:57.143
Bobby Donnell's wife
was being threatened.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.913
He sent Alan Neel
to scare Mr. Hinks,

27:59.946 --> 28:02.348
to warn him.

28:02.382 --> 28:05.418
Alan Neel committed
a supervening act of murder,

28:05.451 --> 28:09.956
and now the prosecution is
using the felony murder rule

28:09.990 --> 28:11.958
as a means to get
Bobby Donnell.

28:11.992 --> 28:13.226
That is what is going on.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.128
That's what's going on.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.163
Bobby Donnell
sent a known killer

28:17.197 --> 28:19.432
out to threaten a man.

28:19.465 --> 28:23.103
Is it really unforeseeable
that a murder happened?

28:30.176 --> 28:31.444
(door opens)

28:31.477 --> 28:33.046
Did he rule?

28:33.079 --> 28:34.447
Not yet.

28:40.954 --> 28:42.956
I'm sorry, Bobby.

28:42.989 --> 28:45.158
You did fine, Ellenor.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.427
I got my ass kicked.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.130
Let's just admit it.
I just got my ass kicked.

28:50.163 --> 28:55.001
He took it under advisement.
Anything could happen.

28:55.035 --> 28:59.305
Listen, I have
a little problem myself.

28:59.339 --> 29:02.976
My $500,000 settlement --

29:03.009 --> 29:05.111
I think it was
the result of extortion.

29:05.145 --> 29:07.047
How so?

29:07.080 --> 29:09.550
Well, seems my client's husband
and the partner of his law firm

29:09.583 --> 29:12.152
were involved in some sort
of embezzlement scheme.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.187
Karen, my client,
tried to extort Bannish.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.557
Well, he basically steered her
to sue his law firm

29:16.590 --> 29:18.859
so all the partners
would have to pay her.

29:18.892 --> 29:20.393
I was used as a pawn.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.529
You know this for sure?

29:22.563 --> 29:24.998
Well, I know the embezzlement
went on for sure.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.267
My client denies the lawsuit
is anything but legitimate,

29:27.300 --> 29:29.102
but it's just --
it's too suspicious.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.137
She demands to file a complaint.

29:31.171 --> 29:32.573
The defendant then makes
an offer

29:32.606 --> 29:34.908
with no discovery whatsoever.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.143
It's just way too suspicious.

29:37.177 --> 29:41.047
And what's your problem?

29:41.081 --> 29:42.983
What's my problem?

29:43.016 --> 29:45.519
You have to ask me
what's my problem?

29:45.552 --> 29:48.354
Unless you have proof
the lawsuit is bogus. Do you?

29:48.388 --> 29:49.956
No.

29:49.990 --> 29:51.357
Then accept the offer
and be done with it.

29:51.391 --> 29:53.426
Excuse me?

29:53.459 --> 29:55.295
If you do anything
the queer the settlement,

29:55.328 --> 29:56.563
your client could have
an action against us

29:56.597 --> 29:58.031
for the full amount.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.332
This is not
a money thing, Eugene.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.334
No, it's a legal thing,
Rebecca.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.969
As I understand it,

30:03.003 --> 30:05.238
you sued under the theory
of wrongful death.

30:05.271 --> 30:08.575
The defendant is settling
under that theory. Accept.

30:08.609 --> 30:10.443
But it's not that simple --

30:10.476 --> 30:12.846
We do not need to be sued
by a client

30:12.879 --> 30:14.848
at this time, Rebecca.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.986
Do you have specific knowledge
that the lawsuit is bogus?

30:20.020 --> 30:22.523
No.

30:22.556 --> 30:24.224
Is your client
instructing you to accept

30:24.257 --> 30:25.626
the terms of the settlement?

30:25.659 --> 30:27.460
Yes.

30:27.493 --> 30:31.297
Then that's exactly
what you do.

30:38.471 --> 30:40.306
Fine.

30:44.077 --> 30:45.512
Martin.

30:45.546 --> 30:46.547
Helen.

30:46.580 --> 30:48.014
What's with the summons?

30:48.048 --> 30:49.449
Oh, all the witnesses
are getting them,

30:49.482 --> 30:51.952
even those we can expect
to be cooperative.

30:51.985 --> 30:53.920
Why do you want me
to be a witness at all?

30:53.954 --> 30:55.956
Well, Helen,
Lindsay Dole is a friend.

30:55.989 --> 30:59.059
She asks you to pay a visit to
William Hinks to threaten him.

30:59.092 --> 31:01.461
That has no relevance
to Bobby Donnell's actions.

31:01.494 --> 31:03.964
Perhaps not, but you'll
allow me to be curious.

31:03.997 --> 31:06.399
I'm not going to be
a prosecutorial witness

31:06.432 --> 31:08.134
against Bobby Donnell.

31:08.168 --> 31:11.371
I wouldn't call on you to do
anything but tell the truth.

31:11.404 --> 31:13.940
Yes, well, experience,
I'm sure, tells you

31:13.974 --> 31:15.676
that even
the most neutral witness

31:15.709 --> 31:19.012
finds a way to get in
his or her bias.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.313
Meaning?

31:20.346 --> 31:22.983
The prosecution of
Bobby Donnell is outrageous.

31:23.016 --> 31:25.051
You don't want me
on the stand.

31:25.085 --> 31:27.353
Trust me.

31:27.387 --> 31:29.422
Thanks for the warning.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.958
When I do call you,

31:31.992 --> 31:34.895
I'll be sure to declare you
a hostile witness.

31:41.735 --> 31:44.337
The public defender
representing Alan Neel

31:44.370 --> 31:47.407
is Bernard Shanly.
Two years out of law school.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.242
The D. A. must love him.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.344
He's young, inexperienced.

31:51.377 --> 31:55.015
He's got a decent reputation
for a kid, but he's a kid.

31:55.048 --> 31:56.517
Where can I find this kid?

31:56.550 --> 31:58.084
P.D.'s office.

31:58.118 --> 32:00.420
He's usually at arraignments,
taking assignments.

32:00.453 --> 32:01.655
Could visit him there.

32:01.688 --> 32:05.926
That's what I think
I'll do.

32:07.661 --> 32:12.065
Oh, you two came together,
did you?

32:12.098 --> 32:13.634
We came up
on the same elevator.

32:13.667 --> 32:15.636
Mm-hmm.

32:15.669 --> 32:17.270
Well, if we execute
the documents,

32:17.303 --> 32:19.339
I'll give you a check.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.674
Your other partners
don't even --

32:20.707 --> 32:21.975
Rebecca.

32:22.008 --> 32:24.711
We can go
in the conference room.

32:47.233 --> 32:51.037
Excuse me.
Do you know which one
is Bernard Shanly?

32:55.742 --> 32:57.644
Uh, Mr. Shanly?

32:57.678 --> 32:59.513
Eugene Young.
How you doing?

32:59.546 --> 33:02.182
Fine. Good to meet you.

33:02.215 --> 33:05.385
Likewise. Could I steal
a second?

33:05.418 --> 33:08.288
All I really want to do
is talk to him.

33:08.321 --> 33:10.190
I just can't advise that.

33:10.223 --> 33:11.792
Could I ask why?

33:11.825 --> 33:13.727
Well, until he signs
his proffer,

33:13.760 --> 33:16.597
I don't want to do anything
to screw up the plea.

33:16.630 --> 33:19.332
Manslaughter -- 20 years.

33:19.365 --> 33:23.169
Can I ask, why'd you
advise him to go for that?

33:23.203 --> 33:26.272
Well, they have videotape
of his going in,

33:26.306 --> 33:28.141
audiotape of the attack.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.577
I understand,
but his going in proves nothing

33:30.611 --> 33:34.080
and the audiotape --
Well, I haven't heard it yet.

33:34.114 --> 33:37.083
I have. You can actually hear
the beginning of the attack.

33:37.117 --> 33:38.552
Even so,
can we be absolutely sure

33:38.585 --> 33:40.621
how the attack began?

33:40.654 --> 33:43.590
Is it possible
Mr. Hinks rushed him?

33:43.624 --> 33:45.225
Didn't sound like it.

33:45.258 --> 33:47.594
Didn't sound like it?
I asked is it possible?

33:47.628 --> 33:49.763
Are you cross-examining me?

33:49.796 --> 33:53.299
I don't mean to, but if
there is that possibility...

33:53.333 --> 33:54.701
Let's face it, Bernard.

33:54.735 --> 33:57.571
William Hinks
was a serial killer.

33:57.604 --> 33:59.673
The idea that he might have
tried to kill Alan Neel

33:59.706 --> 34:01.107
-is not beyond --
-That didn't happen.

34:01.141 --> 34:02.843
Were you there?

34:02.876 --> 34:04.377
Look, what's your point?

34:04.410 --> 34:06.412
My point is for you
to jump at manslaughter

34:06.446 --> 34:08.514
without so much as
considering all these options

34:08.549 --> 34:11.317
was bad lawyering, Bernard,
and if there's any way

34:11.351 --> 34:13.219
you can still wiggle out
of the plea bargain --

34:13.253 --> 34:15.088
It's a good deal
for my client.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.257
Bernard, you're young.
The last thing you need --

34:17.290 --> 34:19.626
Please, don't patronize me.

34:19.659 --> 34:21.327
I'm not trying
to patronize you --

34:21.360 --> 34:23.362
You are, and I don't
appreciate it.

34:23.396 --> 34:25.498
You made a mistake. If it's
possible to at all undo it --

34:25.532 --> 34:28.234
Why? To help Bobby Donnell?
He's not --

34:28.268 --> 34:29.636
To help yourself.

34:29.670 --> 34:32.237
It's one thing to be
thought of as inexperienced.

34:32.272 --> 34:33.739
It's quite another
to be considered

34:33.774 --> 34:35.341
a prosecutorial bag man.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.110
Goodbye.

34:37.143 --> 34:40.080
Why do you think
they asked for you, Bernard?

34:41.715 --> 34:44.685
The district attorney
singled you out.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.222
Why is that?

34:49.255 --> 34:51.858
Look...

34:51.891 --> 34:54.427
I'm not trying
to beat you up here,

34:54.460 --> 34:56.129
but you're
a defense attorney.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.731
You're one of us,
not them.

34:57.764 --> 35:00.667
I have to be
on my client's side.

35:00.701 --> 35:02.435
Let me at least
talk to him.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.571
I won't screw up
your proffer. I just want --

35:04.605 --> 35:07.473
No, I can't allow that.
I can't.

35:07.508 --> 35:09.510
Just tell me this, then.

35:09.543 --> 35:12.412
Is he going to say Bobby
directed him to kill Hinks,

35:12.445 --> 35:14.447
or will he just say

35:14.480 --> 35:16.817
he got the idea that
that's what Bobby wanted?

35:16.850 --> 35:19.452
There's nothing equivocal
about it.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.855
He will say Bobby Donnell
hired him

35:21.888 --> 35:24.658
to kill William Hinks.

35:27.528 --> 35:31.164
Eugene, we're in.

35:40.440 --> 35:41.742
WOMAN: Be seated.

35:48.615 --> 35:49.950
The first issue --

35:49.983 --> 35:52.252
Whether a defendant
may be charged

35:52.285 --> 35:54.187
with conspiracy
to commit murder

35:54.220 --> 35:55.956
when the one actually
committing the murder

35:55.989 --> 35:58.491
is convicted of manslaughter?

35:58.525 --> 36:00.426
The answer is yes.

36:00.460 --> 36:04.798
Prosecutors must be given
free reign to plea bargain.

36:04.831 --> 36:07.634
This falls
within their discretion.

36:07.668 --> 36:11.471
The defendant's motion
to dismiss the conspiracy count

36:11.505 --> 36:13.540
is therefore denied.

36:15.408 --> 36:18.211
Second issue --
Felony murder.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.980
As a matter of law,

36:20.013 --> 36:23.984
if Mr. Donnell directed
Mr. Neel to break into
the victim's house

36:24.017 --> 36:26.887
with the specific intent
of assaulting him,

36:26.920 --> 36:29.255
Mr. Donnell
becomes an accessory,

36:29.289 --> 36:32.392
and both he and Mr. Neel
are guilty of felony murder.

36:32.425 --> 36:37.631
Whether or not Mr. Donnell
actually did instruct Mr. Neel,

36:37.664 --> 36:40.534
that is a question of fact,
not law,

36:40.567 --> 36:43.537
and it is therefore
a jury question.

36:43.570 --> 36:45.672
Accordingly,
defendant's motion

36:45.706 --> 36:48.875
to dismiss
the felony murder count

36:48.909 --> 36:50.711
is also denied.

36:52.345 --> 36:53.747
We are adjourned.

36:59.586 --> 37:01.922
Okay, we go to work,

37:01.955 --> 37:04.324
we get ready to go
to trial.

37:04.357 --> 37:06.827
Mr. Young?

37:06.860 --> 37:09.863
Can we get together?

37:14.901 --> 37:17.370
-What's going on?
-Lindsay.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.640
-You have to stop it.
-You need to calm down.

37:19.673 --> 37:21.575
They're going after my husband.
Why are they doing this?

37:21.608 --> 37:23.777
You need to calm down.

37:23.810 --> 37:24.978
Look, I've let them know
I'm against it,

37:25.011 --> 37:26.513
but there's nothing else
I can do.

37:26.547 --> 37:27.914
It's out of my hands.

37:27.948 --> 37:29.883
I've never asked you
for a favor.

37:29.916 --> 37:33.286
Lindsay, if I could
stop it, I would. Trust me.

37:33.319 --> 37:36.022
I think this prosecution
is out of line,

37:36.056 --> 37:39.392
but on the facts,
there is a case.

37:43.329 --> 37:45.365
Why are they doing this?

38:14.027 --> 38:16.429
Okay, listen up.

38:16.462 --> 38:19.900
Nothing happened today
that wasn't expected.

38:19.933 --> 38:23.036
We figured it'd go this way.

38:23.069 --> 38:24.905
It did.

38:24.938 --> 38:28.008
Now we dig in.

38:28.041 --> 38:30.511
I dig in.

38:33.079 --> 38:34.815
I'm scared.

38:36.517 --> 38:38.685
I won't lie about it.

38:38.719 --> 38:41.054
But the firm...

38:43.524 --> 38:45.058
Eugene, I think, has
already demonstrated clearly

38:45.091 --> 38:46.760
that he can run this shop

38:46.793 --> 38:49.495
and we can be
just as strong as ever.

38:49.530 --> 38:51.865
We cannot,

38:51.898 --> 38:53.600
cannot,

38:53.634 --> 38:58.038
cannot let ourselves
become demoralized.

38:58.071 --> 39:03.777
We have to stay together
and support Eugene's leadership.

39:03.810 --> 39:05.912
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

39:08.682 --> 39:13.019
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to--

39:13.053 --> 39:15.856
I find Eugene's leadership
thus far

39:15.889 --> 39:17.524
to be a little frightening.

39:17.558 --> 39:20.627
Aside from being autocratic,

39:20.661 --> 39:22.963
his direction to me
to look the other way

39:22.996 --> 39:25.799
and rubber-stamp a settlement
I know was illegal --

39:25.832 --> 39:27.033
Rebecca --

39:27.067 --> 39:29.770
Bobby, I want to say this
to all of you,

39:29.803 --> 39:33.039
and I know the timing stinks
given the situation you're in,

39:33.073 --> 39:34.908
and I apologize,

39:34.941 --> 39:37.644
but Eugene basically
instructed me

39:37.678 --> 39:39.546
to go along with extortion,

39:39.580 --> 39:41.915
and the reason he did so
was fiscal.

39:41.948 --> 39:44.184
That contingency is something
we could use right now.

39:44.217 --> 39:46.052
It would be more expedient,

39:46.086 --> 39:49.055
let alone more profitable,
to turn a blind eye.

39:49.089 --> 39:51.191
Get off your high horse,
would you, Rebecca?

39:51.224 --> 39:52.593
ELLENOR: All right.

39:52.626 --> 39:54.060
No. We're up
to our necks here.

39:54.094 --> 39:55.796
We don't need
her preaching.

39:55.829 --> 39:57.764
I'll say what I have to say.

39:57.798 --> 40:01.067
You all sat quietly
and let Eugene be the leader

40:01.101 --> 40:03.670
because his decision-making
was dirty work,

40:03.704 --> 40:05.539
and you were glad
to let him do it.

40:05.572 --> 40:08.909
That settlement was extortion.

40:08.942 --> 40:11.945
Eugene's okay with it, fine,

40:11.978 --> 40:15.549
but if his face
is the new face of this firm,

40:15.582 --> 40:17.951
it's not the same firm I know.

40:20.821 --> 40:24.124
All right, come on,
let's not do this, not now.

40:25.526 --> 40:28.194
I'm a partner here, Jimmy.
You're not.

40:28.228 --> 40:32.098
All right! Now that's enough.

40:32.132 --> 40:34.500
We have to stay together now.

40:45.178 --> 40:46.713
Now what?

40:46.747 --> 40:49.482
Nothing.

40:49.516 --> 40:50.984
What'd Toomey want?

40:51.017 --> 40:53.654
Let's go to your office.
Lindsay?

41:09.803 --> 41:12.606
Okay, they've offered
a plea.

41:12.639 --> 41:14.708
Aiding and abetting
a felonious assault.

41:14.741 --> 41:17.811
2 1/2 years, one suspended.

41:17.844 --> 41:20.180
Disbarment.

41:20.213 --> 41:21.982
Right.

41:22.015 --> 41:25.151
What I would like to do...

41:25.185 --> 41:27.988
is chop that down
to one year.

41:28.021 --> 41:30.624
Eugene, cop to --

41:30.657 --> 41:33.627
Bobby, we may have a chance
in outright acquittal --

41:33.660 --> 41:35.662
All they have
is Neel's word.

41:35.696 --> 41:37.664
I understand,
and I can argue

41:37.698 --> 41:38.965
his motive to lie

41:38.999 --> 41:40.701
in exchange
for the plea bargain.

41:40.734 --> 41:43.203
The problem is that tape.
What he said to Hinks --

41:43.236 --> 41:45.271
that precedes
any motive to lie.

41:45.305 --> 41:47.908
Also, it's already playing
all over the press

41:47.941 --> 41:49.676
about those two cops
that got killed,

41:49.710 --> 41:51.678
how you got them killed.

41:51.712 --> 41:53.213
Even if I keep that
out of evidence,

41:53.246 --> 41:55.015
which I should be
able to do,

41:55.048 --> 41:58.060
the odds of the jury
not knowing about it...

42:01.354 --> 42:04.691
if you get convicted
of felony murder,

42:04.725 --> 42:06.226
you get life.

42:06.259 --> 42:08.929
Obviously, I'm hoping
that won't happen,

42:08.962 --> 42:10.997
but the risk...

42:15.836 --> 42:18.004
the risk.

42:18.038 --> 42:21.708
If I could get it down
to one year,

42:21.742 --> 42:24.210
the disbarment might not
have to be permanent.

42:24.244 --> 42:28.582
You really have
to think about it.

42:28.615 --> 42:33.019
I'll leave you two alone.

42:40.293 --> 42:42.996
I can't believe
this is happening.

42:43.029 --> 42:45.999
There's no way
I'm pleading guilty.

42:46.032 --> 42:48.101
Bobby, we're about
to have a baby.

42:51.738 --> 42:53.173
I'm not getting
life in prison.

42:53.206 --> 42:57.043
It could never,
ever happen.

42:57.077 --> 42:58.378
I can't even
think straight.

42:58.411 --> 42:59.746
It could never happen.

42:59.780 --> 43:01.214
What if you do?

43:03.416 --> 43:05.251
What if --
what about, um,

43:05.285 --> 43:07.253
what -- what about
self-defense

43:07.287 --> 43:09.289
or maybe defense
of others, maybe --

43:09.322 --> 43:11.925
The threat
has to be imminent.

43:20.366 --> 43:24.905
I don't understand how
this can be happening.

43:24.938 --> 43:29.643
I'm not pleading guilty.

43:29.676 --> 43:32.779
I'll go to trial.

43:32.813 --> 43:36.817
I am not pleading guilty.

44:01.775 --> 44:04.077
â™ª (theme)

44:20.193 --> 44:21.695
You stinker!
