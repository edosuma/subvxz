10:45.126 --> 10:47.795
THIS IS CASE NUMBER TX1138‐‐

10:47.878 --> 10:49.422
INVESTIGATION
INTO THE DISAPPEARANCE

10:49.505 --> 10:51.924
OF AGENT PAUL BRIGGS
EIGHT DAYS AGO.

10:51.966 --> 10:54.427
SPEAKING FIRST
WITH AGENT TUTURRO‐‐

10:54.468 --> 10:55.970
LET'S BEGIN.

10:56.053 --> 10:58.097
‐ FINALLY. YOU GONNA
EXPLAIN SOME SH‐‐?

10:58.139 --> 11:00.266
‐ WHY DO YOU BELIEVE
YOU WERE ASSIGNED TO GRACELAND?

11:00.349 --> 11:02.184
‐ I WAS BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE
TO INVESTIGATE BRIGGS.

11:02.268 --> 11:04.103
‐ TWO WEEKS AGO,
MIKE TOLD ME WHY HE WAS HERE.

11:04.186 --> 11:05.729
‐ AGENT WARREN
WAS ASSIGNED TO GRACELAND

11:05.771 --> 11:07.398
TO INVESTIGATE PAUL BRIGGS.

11:07.481 --> 11:09.442
‐ MIKEY‐‐HE'S A RAT?

11:09.525 --> 11:11.193
‐ WAIT. WHAT?
‐ GREAT.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.571
‐ JAKES‐‐
WHAT'S HIS INVOLVEMENT?

11:13.654 --> 11:14.864
‐ HE AND JAKES WERE CLOSE.

11:14.905 --> 11:16.323
‐ HE FELT BETRAYED, OF COURSE.

11:16.407 --> 11:18.367
DID I THINK IT WOULD SEND
HIM RUNNING? NO.

11:18.409 --> 11:19.869
‐ I FIGURED AGENT BRIGGS
WOULD TURN TO HIM.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.579
‐ JAKES AND BRIGGS
HAD SECRETS.

11:21.620 --> 11:23.080
‐ JAKES KNEW BRIGGS WAS DIRTY.

11:23.122 --> 11:24.206
‐ HE WENT TO JAKES?

11:24.248 --> 11:25.833
‐ HE ASKED ME DRIVE HIM
TO THE PORT.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.126
DIDN'T SAY WHY.
I DIDN'T ASK.

11:27.209 --> 11:29.462
‐ JAKES PROVIDED A BOAT
FOR BRIGGS TO ESCAPE.

11:29.545 --> 11:31.964
‐ YOU SH‐‐ING ME? CALL
THE GODDAMN COAST GUARD ALREADY.

11:32.047 --> 11:33.215
‐ WHY IS BRIGGS ON A BOAT?

11:33.299 --> 11:34.633
‐ SHOULD I BE ASKING
FOR AN ATTORNEY?

11:34.675 --> 11:36.343
‐ WHY WOULD BRIGGS RUN?

11:36.427 --> 11:38.137
‐ PAUL THOUGHT
THAT WE HAD A RECORDING

11:38.220 --> 11:40.347
THAT IMPLICATED HIM
IN THE MURDER OF JUAN BADILLO.

11:40.431 --> 11:41.974
‐ MURDER?
‐ YOU SERIOUS?

11:42.057 --> 11:43.309
[scoffs]

11:43.350 --> 11:44.602
‐ MY BRAIN ISN'T PROCESSING
ANY OF THIS.

11:44.643 --> 11:46.145
THIS IS STUPID.
‐ WE'RE TALKING

11:46.187 --> 11:48.689
ABOUT PAUL BRIGGS, RIGHT?
‐ I STOPPED LISTENING TO YOU.

11:48.772 --> 11:50.149
‐ HOW MUCH LONGER
WILL THIS TAKE?

11:50.232 --> 11:51.734
‐ I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT,
AGENT WARREN.

11:51.775 --> 11:53.110
I PUT THE REST
OF YOUR CASE LOAD ON HOLD,

11:53.194 --> 11:54.320
SO THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME.

11:54.403 --> 11:56.280
AND UNLESS WE FIND
PAUL BRIGGS,

11:56.363 --> 11:58.199
I'LL HAVE TO SHUT DOWN
GRACELAND.

12:14.924 --> 12:18.219
‐ I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
INCRIMINATING IN THERE.

12:18.302 --> 12:22.515
‐ NO. JUST SOME OLD‐ASS
CHINESE TAKEOUT FOR THEM.

12:22.598 --> 12:25.434
‐ OH, NO, MAN, I LIVE HERE.
‐ NAH. YOU HAVE TO WAIT

12:25.518 --> 12:27.228
UNTIL THEY FINISH SWEEPING.
‐ YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.396
‐ THEY'RE LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE
OF COLLUSION WITH BRIGGS.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.065
‐ THEY'RE GOING THROUGH
OUR ROOMS?

12:31.148 --> 12:32.608
‐ HEY, MIKEY!
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD, MAN.

12:32.650 --> 12:34.276
I'M SURE
THEY'LL LET YOU THROUGH.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.153
‐ NO, I'M NOT ON THEIR TEAM.
‐ YEAH, SAYS THE RAT.

12:36.195 --> 12:38.239
‐ BOTH OF YOU BACK OFF.
‐ WHAT DO YOU MEAN BACK OFF?

12:38.322 --> 12:40.199
YOU SIDING WITH HIM ON THIS?
‐ HE'S A SNITCH, CHARLIE.

12:40.282 --> 12:42.326
‐ YOU LEFT YOUR RIGHT TO LECTURE
BACK AT THE PORT, DALE.

12:42.409 --> 12:44.537
‐ YEAH, AND YOU GAVE UP YOURS
WHEN YOU STARTED

12:44.620 --> 12:45.663
BANGING THE RAT.
‐ COME ON.

12:45.746 --> 12:47.122
‐ WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
ALL RIGHT, MAN,

12:47.164 --> 12:48.791
TALK WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:48.832 --> 12:49.833
‐ BOY, FALL BACK.
‐ BOY.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.418
‐ STOP. STOP!
‐ FALL BACK!

12:51.502 --> 12:53.045
‐ HE'S RIGHT.
‐ WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE'S RIGHT?

12:53.128 --> 12:54.838
YOU KNOW, YOU AND HIM
RAN BRIGGS OFF.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.882
‐ YOU THINK BRIGGS IS INNOCENT?
‐ HELL, YES, I DO.

12:56.924 --> 12:59.552
LOOK, BRIGGS DON'T DEAL DRUGS,
AND HE DON'T KILL FBI AGENTS.

12:59.635 --> 13:01.345
‐ AND YOU DON'T RUN
WHEN YOU'RE INNOCENT.

13:01.387 --> 13:03.180
‐ WHAT ABOUT <i>THE FUGITIVE?</i>
‐ THAT'S A MOVIE, JOHNNY.

13:03.222 --> 13:05.099
‐ EVERYBODY STOP
POINTING FINGERS, OKAY?

13:05.182 --> 13:06.809
YOU WANT TO BE MAD AT SOMEBODY,

13:06.892 --> 13:08.561
BE AT THE PERSON
WHO'S NOT HERE.

13:08.602 --> 13:11.188
BECAUSE THE FIVE OF US‐‐
WE ARE STUCK IN THIS TOGETHER.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.856
‐ OKAY.
WE'RE DONE WITH THE ROOMS.

13:12.898 --> 13:13.732
‐ THANK YOU.
‐ THANK YOU!

13:13.816 --> 13:15.192
‐ DOESN'T MATTER.

13:15.234 --> 13:17.278
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE TOGETHER
MUCH LONGER ANYWAY.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.113
‐ WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
‐ THAT MEANS THEY'RE NOT GONNA

13:19.196 --> 13:20.656
KEEP LETTING US SURF
AND PAY UTILITIES AROUND HERE

13:20.698 --> 13:22.866
LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.
‐ YOU HEARD CLARKE.

13:22.950 --> 13:25.536
WITH BRIGGS IN THE WIND,
GRACELAND'S BURNT.

13:25.619 --> 13:27.871
‐ NOT LIKE THERE'S MUCH
TO SAVE HERE ANYWAY.

13:27.955 --> 13:30.457
‐ DALE JAKES...
‐ COME ON, JOHN BOY.

13:30.541 --> 13:33.127
NO ROUSING
HALFTIME SPEECH TODAY?

13:35.296 --> 13:36.755
JOKE.

13:36.797 --> 13:39.842
‐ GUYS, WE CAN STILL SAVE
THE HOUSE IF WE FIND BRIGGS.

13:39.925 --> 13:41.760
‐ YOU SERIOUS, MAN?
‐ YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.

13:41.802 --> 13:43.762
AND IF I'M RIGHT, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA SHUT DOWN GRACELAND.

13:43.846 --> 13:45.889
‐ YO, THERE'S NO WAY
WE'RE FINDING BRIGGS.

13:45.931 --> 13:47.599
‐ JOHNNY, YOU GIVING UP?

13:47.683 --> 13:50.686
[scoffs]

13:50.769 --> 13:52.980
‐ YO, CAN WE TALK?

13:53.063 --> 13:55.316
‐ WHAT DO YOU WANT, JOHNNY?

13:55.399 --> 13:57.568
‐ YO, MAN,
IF BRIGGS NEEDED HELP...

13:57.651 --> 13:59.903
WHY WOULD HE GO TO YOU?

13:59.945 --> 14:01.905
‐ DID YOU REALLY JUST
COME IN HERE TO ASK ME

14:01.947 --> 14:03.407
WHY BRIGGS CHOSE ME OVER YOU?

14:03.449 --> 14:04.908
‐ NO.
‐ REALLY?

14:04.992 --> 14:07.745
‐ YEAH, DUDE, YEAH!

14:09.413 --> 14:10.581
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

14:10.664 --> 14:12.291
‐ GROW UP, JOHNNY.

14:12.374 --> 14:15.169
THIS WIDE‐EYED,
POUTY‐FACED SH‐‐...

14:15.252 --> 14:17.212
MAYBE BRIGGS
WOULD HAVE TURNED TO YOU

14:17.296 --> 14:19.798
IF YOU ACTED LESS A CHILD
AND MORE A MAN.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.301
THEN YOU COULD BE THE ACCOMPLICE
TO MURDER AND NOT ME.

14:22.384 --> 14:23.635
‐ ALL RIGHT.
‐ I GOT MORE.

14:23.719 --> 14:25.471
‐ I WANT TO HEAR IT.
‐ BRIGGS AND I...

14:25.512 --> 14:27.681
WE GO WAY BACK, ALL RIGHT?
WAY BACK‐‐

14:27.765 --> 14:29.141
BEFORE YOU.

14:29.183 --> 14:31.143
AND SOMETIMES
PEOPLE ARE MESSED UP,

14:31.226 --> 14:32.728
AND THERE'S NOTHING
MORE TO IT,

14:32.811 --> 14:35.189
AND THEY HURT PEOPLE
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE TRYING NOT TO.

14:35.230 --> 14:36.482
‐ MM‐HMM.
‐ PERIOD.

14:36.565 --> 14:38.442
‐ I KNOW.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

14:38.484 --> 14:40.736
WHY THEY DON'T TRY HARDER.

14:50.287 --> 14:52.623
‐ WE CAN PROVE ALL OF IT.

14:52.664 --> 14:56.293
WE CAN PROVE
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

14:56.335 --> 14:58.170
‐ THE HOUSE BURNS DOWN.

14:58.212 --> 15:02.591
[echoing]
THE AGENTS INSIDE BURN WITH IT.

15:02.674 --> 15:04.426
‐ YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT
REAL FAST

15:04.510 --> 15:07.137
THERE ARE NO SECRETS
AT GRACELAND.

15:07.179 --> 15:09.181
‐ EXCEPT FOR BRIGGS.

15:09.223 --> 15:12.017
‐ YEAH.
EXCEPT FOR BRIGGS.

15:15.854 --> 15:18.899
‐ I WAS YOUNG, AMBITIOUS,
AND IN LOVE.

15:18.982 --> 15:20.484
‐ WHO WAS THE GIRL?

15:20.526 --> 15:22.778
‐ THAT, MY FRIEND, IS A STORY
FOR ANOTHER PLACE AND TIME.

15:22.820 --> 15:24.696
‐ ONE MINUTE LATER,
ANOTHER CALL WAS MADE

15:24.780 --> 15:27.991
FROM THE SAME PAY PHONE TO LISA,
ONE OF THE AGENTS IN THE HOUSE.

15:28.075 --> 15:31.745
[echoing] EVERYONE KNEW
THAT THEY WERE A COUPLE.

15:33.580 --> 15:35.666
‐ WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

15:35.749 --> 15:37.251
JAKES PUT HIM ON A BOAT.

15:37.334 --> 15:39.336
HE'S PROBABLY
ON ANOTHER CONTINENT BY NOW.

15:39.378 --> 15:41.171
‐ YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND BRIGGS
ON ANY MAP.

15:41.213 --> 15:43.173
I'M TRYING TO FIND HIM
UP HERE.

15:43.215 --> 15:45.884
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS
ANOTHER HOUSE BEFORE THIS?

15:45.968 --> 15:48.220
IT WAS CALLED THE ESTATE,
AND IT BURNED DOWN.

15:48.262 --> 15:50.305
‐ MM‐HMM.
IT'LL MESS YOU UP.

15:50.389 --> 15:52.099
‐ HE WAS IN LOVE.

15:52.182 --> 15:53.642
‐ WITH WHO?

15:53.725 --> 15:55.561
‐ WITH ONE OF HIS ROOMMATES.

15:57.563 --> 16:00.941
THIS WOMAN‐‐LISA.
SHE'S DEA.

16:01.024 --> 16:03.360
<i>WAS.</i>
SHE DIED IN THE FIRE.

16:06.029 --> 16:07.364
‐ GOD.

16:11.118 --> 16:13.203
‐ I KNOW WHERE BRIGGS IS.

16:13.287 --> 16:14.788
‐ WHERE?
‐ IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

16:14.872 --> 16:16.707
‐ WHERE IS HE?
‐ HE'S HERE.

16:16.748 --> 16:18.208
HE'S HERE.
HE NEVER LEFT.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.501
IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

16:19.585 --> 16:21.503
JANGLES.
JANGLES BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN.

16:21.587 --> 16:23.839
JANGLES KILLED LISA.
BRIGGS WOULD NEVER LET THAT GO.

16:23.922 --> 16:26.425
‐ MIKE, STOP.
STOP MOVING.

16:26.508 --> 16:28.802
STOP THINKING.
JUST STOP.

16:28.886 --> 16:32.890
YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
A GOOD AGENT WOULD DO.

16:32.931 --> 16:35.934
‐ WELL, JUAN'S DEAD.
THIS HOUSE IS BURNED.

16:35.976 --> 16:38.353
AND THAT'S ALL BECAUSE
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH, SO...

16:40.189 --> 16:42.524
‐ HE FOOLED ALL OF US, MIKE.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.128
[sighs]
BELIEVE ME, THERE IS A...

17:03.170 --> 17:06.548
A VERSION OF THAT
THAT I WANT, BUT...

17:06.632 --> 17:07.716
NOT LIKE THIS.

17:07.799 --> 17:09.426
‐ WHY'S THAT?

17:09.468 --> 17:11.929
‐ 'CAUSE THAT WASN'T
ABOUT ME.

17:13.972 --> 17:17.809
YOU'RE LOST, MIKE, AND...

17:17.851 --> 17:19.853
I'M NOT THE ANSWER.

17:41.708 --> 17:44.044
‐ <i>HOLA, MAMITA.</i>

17:44.127 --> 17:45.838
LISTEN,
I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.

17:45.921 --> 17:47.381
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR FEDERALES

17:47.464 --> 17:48.590
WORKING IN MY AREA?

17:48.674 --> 17:51.760
OH, YEAH?
WHAT IF I BUY YOU DINNER?

17:51.844 --> 17:53.178
[laughs]

17:53.220 --> 17:55.848
UH‐HUH.
SO HOW MANY IN MY AREA?

17:55.889 --> 17:58.642
<i>¿CINCO HOMBRES?</i>
MENDEZ IN LONG BEACH.

17:58.684 --> 18:00.394
OKAY.
WHO ELSE?

18:03.230 --> 18:04.648
YEAH, YOU'LL HEAR
FROM ME SOON.

18:04.690 --> 18:05.816
<i>TE AMO.</i>

18:51.153 --> 18:52.696
‐ KID'S GOT YOUR MOVES.

18:52.738 --> 18:55.032
[crowd cheering]

18:58.243 --> 18:59.703
‐ WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE?

18:59.745 --> 19:01.538
THAT'S MY FRICKIN' SON!
‐ I'M SORRY.

19:01.622 --> 19:03.040
NOBODY ELSE KNOWS
ABOUT DANIEL.

19:03.123 --> 19:04.583
I FIGURED THIS WOULD BE
A SAFE PLACE TO TALK TO YOU.

19:04.666 --> 19:06.668
‐ I'M SUSPENDED PENDING
INVESTIGATION, THANKS TO YOU.

19:06.752 --> 19:08.128
THEY'RE TALKING
POSSIBLE CRIMINAL CHARGES.

19:08.211 --> 19:09.755
‐ I AM SO SORRY, MAN.
‐ THE BUREAU THINKS

19:09.796 --> 19:11.423
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE OCEAN.

19:11.506 --> 19:12.925
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
‐ CHARLIE‐‐

19:13.008 --> 19:14.343
THAT FEDERALE YOU SAID
SHE'S HANGING OUT WITH?

19:14.426 --> 19:15.594
I THINK THAT COULD BE JANGLES.

19:15.677 --> 19:17.262
‐ JUST TELL HER.
‐ I CAN'T!

19:17.346 --> 19:18.931
SHE'D NEVER BELIEVE ME NOW.
CHANCES ARE,

19:18.972 --> 19:20.432
SHE'D TELL HIM AND END UP
GETTING HERSELF KILLED.

19:20.515 --> 19:22.559
‐ THAT'S BECAUSE SHE THINKS
YOU'RE FULL OF SH‐‐, PAUL.

19:22.601 --> 19:25.479
SHE THINKS YOU'RE ODIN ROSSI.

19:25.562 --> 19:27.856
‐ A LOT OF THINGS
WENT WRONG, D. J.

19:27.898 --> 19:29.608
‐ ARE YOU ODIN ROSSI?

19:29.691 --> 19:31.401
‐ LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE RUNNING
LOW ON CONFIDENCE, BROTHER,

19:31.485 --> 19:34.237
BUT COULD YOU PLEASE HANG WITH
ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER?

19:34.321 --> 19:35.906
‐ DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU DID TO EVERYBODY?

19:35.948 --> 19:37.407
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF I'M WRONG,

19:37.491 --> 19:39.618
I'M PROBABLY GONNA END UP
IN JAIL FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

19:39.701 --> 19:41.328
BUT IF THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT I COULD BE RIGHT,

19:41.411 --> 19:42.996
I CANNOT LEAVE CHARLIE
ALONE WITH THAT MONSTER.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.540
‐ IF YOU'RE BACK TO PLAY
THE HERO‐‐TOO LATE.

19:45.582 --> 19:47.125
NOBODY'S BUYING.

19:47.209 --> 19:50.212
‐ ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
HERE'S THE NUMBER TO A BURNER.

19:50.295 --> 19:51.463
KEEP WATCHING CHARLIE FOR ME.

19:51.546 --> 19:53.131
IF YOU HEAR SOMETHING,
PLEASE CALL ME.

19:53.173 --> 19:55.133
I GOT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

19:58.303 --> 20:01.390
‐ I'M GONNA GO WATCH MY SON
MAKE ME PROUD.

20:05.143 --> 20:07.479
‐ SO I LEAVE TOMORROW.

20:07.562 --> 20:10.774
WITH ODIN GONE AND EVERYTHING,
I CAN'T STAY HERE.

20:10.857 --> 20:13.986
‐ IT'S A SHAME.
I WAS JUST STARTING TO LIKE YOU.

20:14.069 --> 20:15.946
‐ JUST NOW?
‐ JUST THIS VERY SECOND.

20:16.029 --> 20:17.614
I THINK IT'S THE ACCENT.

20:17.656 --> 20:19.533
‐ [chuckles]
I SHOULD SPEAK MORE.

20:19.616 --> 20:21.201
[chuckling]

20:21.284 --> 20:24.162
‐ HEY, YOU EVER HAD
ONE OF YOUR OWN GO BAD?

20:25.872 --> 20:27.666
‐ NEVER IN MEXICO.
‐ RIGHT.

20:29.459 --> 20:32.379
‐ I REMEMBER THIS NAME, UH...
PAUL BRIGGS.

20:32.462 --> 20:36.383
HE'S A VERY RESPECTABLE AGENT.

20:36.466 --> 20:37.759
A LITTLE BIT
RECKLESS, THOUGH.

20:37.843 --> 20:39.678
‐ THAT'S OUR PAULIE.

20:39.761 --> 20:42.014

37:50.858 --> 37:52.360
‐ WOW.

37:52.443 --> 37:55.154
THAT'S AMAZING. HOW?

37:55.196 --> 37:58.074
‐ DISCOVERED THE ORIGIN
OF HIS INFAMOUS KEYS.

37:58.157 --> 37:59.492
THEY'RE TROPHIES.

37:59.575 --> 38:02.829
‐ YOU MEAN HE'D KILL SOMEONE
AND THEN TAKE A KEY

38:02.870 --> 38:04.163
AS A TROPHY?

38:04.247 --> 38:06.332
‐ THIS ONE IS
TO JUAN'S FRONT DOOR.

38:11.504 --> 38:13.172
THIS IS
TO THE ORIGINAL SAFE HOUSE.

38:13.256 --> 38:15.258
YOU GUYS CALLED IT
THE ESTATE.

38:17.593 --> 38:20.012
LISA'S ROOM KEY.

38:20.096 --> 38:21.472
‐ HE KILLED THEM?

38:21.514 --> 38:24.475
‐ IT'S LOOKING THAT WAY.

38:24.559 --> 38:25.893
AND NOW THIS.

38:25.977 --> 38:28.729
I KNOW YOU WERE INVESTIGATING
ODIN ROSSI.

38:28.813 --> 38:30.022
THIS IS ANTHONY BUSCA.

38:30.106 --> 38:31.941
DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM,

38:31.983 --> 38:33.693
BUT WE'VE HAD HITS
IN SOUTH AMERICA

38:33.776 --> 38:35.987
OF HIM USING A PHONE
WE'VE LINKED TO ODIN.

38:36.028 --> 38:36.946
‐ SOUTH AMERICA?

38:38.781 --> 38:41.242
WHERE'D YOU PICK UP THE CALLS?

38:41.325 --> 38:43.202
‐ CAN WE GET A MAP OF ECUADOR
IN HERE, PLEASE?

38:55.965 --> 38:58.717
‐ NEED A RIDE?
‐ YEAH.

39:05.057 --> 39:07.226
OH.
[sighs]

39:07.268 --> 39:09.478
HOW YOU DOING, CHUCK?

39:11.939 --> 39:15.776
‐ NOT GOOD.

39:15.859 --> 39:17.903
‐ YEAH.

39:17.945 --> 39:19.780
‐ I SCREWED UP BIG‐TIME.

39:19.863 --> 39:22.449
‐ CHARLIE, DON'T.
‐ NO, I...

39:22.491 --> 39:25.619
I PUT ALL MY TRUST IN HIM...

39:25.661 --> 39:27.788
AND NOT YOU.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.959
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT YOU.

39:34.044 --> 39:35.963
[crying]
PAUL...

39:36.046 --> 39:37.923
I'M GONNA TURN IN MY BADGE.

39:37.965 --> 39:39.550
‐ NO. NO!

39:39.591 --> 39:42.386
NO, LOOK,
I NEED YOU, CHARLIE.

39:42.428 --> 39:44.888
THE HOUSE NEEDS YOU.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

39:44.930 --> 39:47.099
‐ [inhales deeply]

39:47.141 --> 39:50.602
HOW CAN I TRUST MYSELF?

39:50.644 --> 39:53.647
I GOT THINGS SO WRONG.

39:54.982 --> 39:56.650
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

40:01.488 --> 40:04.033
SORRY.

40:04.116 --> 40:07.161
‐ I'M SORRY TOO.

40:07.202 --> 40:10.998
‐ [sniffles,
inhales deeply]

40:17.880 --> 40:19.590
[door closes]

40:19.631 --> 40:21.216
‐ [sighs]

40:21.300 --> 40:23.135
‐ I WOULDN'T SIGH JUST YET.
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR ROOM.

40:23.177 --> 40:24.428
‐ [chuckles]

40:24.470 --> 40:25.971
LET ME GUESS.
THEY SEIZED ALL MY STUFF.

40:26.013 --> 40:27.222
‐ EVERYTHING.

40:29.641 --> 40:32.186
‐ LOOK WHO IT IS.
‐ YEAH, MAN.

40:32.269 --> 40:33.479
‐ WHAT'S UP?

40:33.562 --> 40:35.689
‐ DID YOU HEAR?
‐ YEAH.

40:35.773 --> 40:36.982
AN INNOCENT MAN.
‐ MM‐HMM.

40:37.024 --> 40:39.234
‐ MIKE FILLED US IN.

40:39.318 --> 40:41.487
‐ SO, UH,
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

40:41.528 --> 40:43.197
‐ BONFIRE.
‐ YOU SHOULD JOIN THEM.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.698
IT'D BE NICE FOR US
TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

40:44.740 --> 40:45.866
‐ CHARLIE, WHY DON'T
YOU GO AHEAD?

40:45.949 --> 40:47.201
I'M GONNA STEAL BRIGGS
FOR A MINUTE.

40:47.284 --> 40:48.702
YOU CAN HELP ME
WITH THE COOLER.

40:48.786 --> 40:50.537
‐ YEAH.

40:50.621 --> 40:53.457
[bottles clinking]

40:55.376 --> 40:57.002
‐ IS IT DONE?

40:57.044 --> 41:00.005
‐ IT IS DONE.

41:00.089 --> 41:01.673
‐ AND THE RECORDER?
‐ WHO KNOWS?

41:01.715 --> 41:05.636
‐ SO WE'RE EVEN?
‐ OH, MORE THAN, BROTHER MAN.

41:05.677 --> 41:07.596
‐ GOOD.

41:09.640 --> 41:12.184
NOW FIX THIS PLACE.

41:19.566 --> 41:21.193
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

41:21.235 --> 41:22.694
‐ YO...

41:22.736 --> 41:24.905
LITTLE SIMBA RETURNING
TO PRIDE ROCK.

41:24.988 --> 41:26.740
YO, WHAT'S UP, BRO?
HOW YOU DOING?

41:26.782 --> 41:28.575
[grunts]
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, MAN.

41:28.617 --> 41:31.286
‐ GOOD TO BE BACK.

41:31.370 --> 41:33.247
YOU KNOW, GUYS, THERE'S NOT
A SET OF FACES IN THE WORLD

41:33.288 --> 41:37.251
THAT MAKE ME
AS HAPPY AS THESE.

41:37.334 --> 41:41.338
[clears throat]
FIVE YEARS AGO...

41:41.380 --> 41:43.715
I HAD POISON PUMPED
INTO MY VEINS.

41:43.757 --> 41:45.968
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT‐‐
YOU THINK YOU'RE STRONG,

41:46.051 --> 41:49.263
BUT THAT DRUG WILL TURN YOU
INTO ITS BITCH SO FAST.

41:49.346 --> 41:51.890
IT'LL TAKE YOUR SLEEP.
IT'LL TAKE YOUR JOY.

41:51.932 --> 41:55.185
IT'LL TAKE YOUR FRIENDS
AND YOUR LOVERS

41:55.227 --> 41:59.857
AND THE BEST OF WHAT YOU ARE.

41:59.982 --> 42:01.692
I FORGOT ABOUT HOME.

42:06.447 --> 42:08.824
I'M SORRY.

42:08.907 --> 42:10.451
TO HOME
AND THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER.

42:10.534 --> 42:11.952
‐ YEAH.
‐ CHEERS.

42:11.994 --> 42:14.329
‐ HOME.

42:14.413 --> 42:15.998
‐ HMM.

42:16.081 --> 42:18.667
YOU KNOW, BRIGGS,
I THINK AFTER YOU GOT HIT

42:18.750 --> 42:20.961
IN THE HEAD,
IT'S TURNED YOU A LITTLE SOFT.

42:21.044 --> 42:23.839
[laughter,
overlapping comments]

42:23.922 --> 42:25.757
‐ I COULD STAND TO LOSE
A FEW EDGES‐‐THAT'S TRUE.

42:25.841 --> 42:28.343
‐ HEY, HEY. I WANT TO MAKE
ONE MORE TOAST.

42:28.427 --> 42:30.929
OKAY, NO. SHH.
JOHNNY.

42:30.971 --> 42:33.557
TO MIKE...

42:33.599 --> 42:36.351
AND HIS RETURN TO HIS DREAM
ON THE EAST COAST.

42:36.435 --> 42:39.563
WE ARE GOING TO MISS YOU.

42:43.817 --> 42:45.277
‐ I LOVE YOU, MIKEY, MAN.
‐ LEVI.

42:45.319 --> 42:49.031
‐ YEAH.

42:49.114 --> 42:51.200
SOMEBODY BREAK OUT
THE BOUNCE HOUSE.

42:51.283 --> 42:52.784
[laughter]

42:58.081 --> 43:02.252
[airplane engine roaring]

43:06.798 --> 43:08.008
‐ SO HOW MANY BOOTS
ON THE GROUND?

43:08.091 --> 43:09.551
‐ TEN AGENTS TOTAL, SIR‐‐

43:09.635 --> 43:11.261
DELRAY'S TEAM AND A TECH‐OPS
GROUP FROM LANGLEY.

43:11.303 --> 43:13.305
‐ WHAT'S THE PLAN?
‐ OUR BEST OPTION IS TO BASE

43:13.347 --> 43:14.973
IN THE HILL
ABOVE JACO'S CITY CENTER

43:15.015 --> 43:16.391
WITH AN OP HOUSE IN TOWN.

43:16.475 --> 43:19.686
‐ DO WE HAVE THOSE LAYOUTS?
‐ YES, SIR.

43:19.770 --> 43:22.814
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE
IS THE MAIN ACCESS ROAD.

43:22.856 --> 43:24.233
‐ WHAT DOES TARGET NUMBER ONE
LOOK LIKE?

43:24.316 --> 43:25.609
‐ WHOO!
‐ A SKINNY CHURCHILL.

43:25.692 --> 43:27.402
‐ [laughs]

43:27.486 --> 43:29.696
‐ A SKINNY CHURCHILL‐‐
I CAN'T PICTURE THIS.

43:29.780 --> 43:32.950
‐ OH, COME ON, BOY. HEY.
‐ HE'S GOT A CIGAR.

43:33.033 --> 43:34.535
‐ FORGET IT, FORGET IT.

43:34.618 --> 43:36.328
ONCE WE'RE SET UP,
CAN THEY JAM US?

43:36.370 --> 43:38.539
‐ YOU CAN'T HAVE ELECTRONIC
COUNTERMEASURES WITHOUT A DISH.

43:38.622 --> 43:40.123
‐ THERE'S NOT A SINGLE DISH
IN TOWN.

43:40.207 --> 43:41.708
‐ GET OFF!

43:41.792 --> 43:44.086
‐ HE'S RIGHT.
THAT'S CONCERTINA WIRE.

43:44.169 --> 43:46.505
‐ I WANT IT CHECKED OUT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MIKE?

43:46.547 --> 43:47.881
‐ IT'S A GOOD PLAN,

43:47.965 --> 43:50.509
BUT I'D CONSIDER MOVING OUR BASE
ABOVE THIS SWITCHBACK.

43:50.551 --> 43:52.928
IT'S GOOD ACCESS TO BOTH ROADS,
IT'S BETTER COVER,

43:53.011 --> 43:56.014
AND FROM THERE,
YOU CAN SEE ALL APPROACHES.

43:56.056 --> 43:59.685
‐ SMART KID.
MOVE IT UP THE HILL.

44:01.228 --> 44:03.647
[keys clacking]

44:17.703 --> 44:21.248
[phone vibrates]

44:21.290 --> 44:23.709
‐ [clears throat]
AGENT BRIGGS.

44:23.750 --> 44:27.087
‐ MIKEY MIKE.
I MISS YOU, MAN.

44:27.129 --> 44:29.047
HOW'S THE WORLD OF POWER
AND MONUMENTS TREATING YOU, HUH?

44:29.089 --> 44:30.841
‐ IT'S GOOD.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

44:30.882 --> 44:33.927
‐ UH, YOU KNOW ME, MAN‐‐
JUST THINKING ABOUT GOOD TIMES.

44:36.722 --> 44:38.974
‐ YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR ME, RIGHT?

44:39.057 --> 44:41.893
‐ THIS PLACE BURNED
BECAUSE OF US.

44:41.935 --> 44:44.896
‐ MY MAN.
HOW'S THE HOUSE?

44:44.938 --> 44:46.857
‐ GOOD. GOOD.
EVERYBODY'S GOOD, YOU KNOW.

44:46.898 --> 44:49.109
IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE WE'RE
MISSING A MUSKETEER, THOUGH.

44:49.151 --> 44:51.194
‐ YOU LIT THE MATCH!

44:51.278 --> 44:52.696
‐ STAY BACK.

44:52.779 --> 44:56.116
‐ GUNS NOW?

44:56.158 --> 44:58.952
[gunshot]

44:58.994 --> 45:01.121
LISTEN, UM...

45:01.163 --> 45:04.166
I THOUGHT
ABOUT TAKING A VACATION.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.504
‐ YEAH.
[laughs]

45:11.465 --> 45:14.217
YOU SERIOUS?
‐ YEAH.

45:14.259 --> 45:17.318
[sighs] LISTEN, MIKE, I HAVEN'T
TOLD ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS,

45:17.318 --> 45:18.781
AND I WANT YOU TO STAY CALM.
