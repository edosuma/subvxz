WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:04.470
I WOULD SWEAR I SAW
SOMEBODY OUT THERE STANDING

00:04.505 --> 00:05.871
AGAINST ONE OF THE TREES.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.171
ADAM!

00:07.206 --> 00:08.774
- I SAW SOMETHING MOVE.
- I DID, TOO.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.209
DO YOU WATCH
FROM THE WOODS?

00:11.477 --> 00:12.843
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

00:12.878 --> 00:15.047
ACCIDENT. SHE DIED
WHEN SHE WAS 3.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.548
GOD.

00:16.583 --> 00:21.153
THERE WAS A HUGE SPINNING BLADE
AND SHE WALKED INTO THAT BLADE.

00:23.489 --> 00:25.022
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:25.057 --> 00:27.292
AND I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.827
WE'VE SPENT
A COMBINED 30 YEARS

00:29.862 --> 00:33.364
INVESTIGATING THE WORLD'S
MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS.

00:33.365 --> 00:35.299
AFTER THOUSANDS OF CASES,

00:35.334 --> 00:38.471
WE ARE READY FOR OUR
MOST IMPORTANT JOURNEY YET.

00:40.406 --> 00:44.543
RESCUING FAMILIES TERRORIZED
BY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

00:44.578 --> 00:47.379
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

00:47.414 --> 00:50.250
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH
BEHIND THE HAUNTING

00:50.285 --> 00:53.086
TO HELP FAMILIES
RECLAIM THEIR HOMES...

00:53.121 --> 00:54.621
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:54.656 --> 00:56.122
...AND THEIR LIVES.

00:59.725 --> 01:02.528
CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS

01:02.563 --> 01:05.682
BASICALLY, CATHERINE LIVES
WITH HER DAUGHTER

01:05.717 --> 01:08.801
ON THIS MASSIVE PROPERTY,
30-SOME-ODD ACRES,

01:08.836 --> 01:10.034
35 ACRES, I GUESS.

01:10.069 --> 01:13.039
11 YEARS AGO, SHE STARTED
HAVING CRAZY EXPERIENCES.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.574
SHE THINKS IT'S HER
FAMILY MEMBERS.

01:14.609 --> 01:15.540
OKAY.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.545
BUT THERE ARE
EXPLODING LIGHT FIXTURES.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.579
HER DAUGHTER WAS SCRATCHED.

01:21.614 --> 01:25.251
SHE HAS SEEN AN APPARITION
OR SOMETHING STANDING BY A TREE

01:25.286 --> 01:28.455
STARING AT HER WHILE
SHE'S SITTING IN HER HOME.

01:28.490 --> 01:31.408
SO IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
IT'S ENTIRELY HER FAMILY.

01:31.443 --> 01:34.327
I MEAN, SOME OF THAT ACTIVITY
SOUNDS DIFFERENT.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.927
ABSOLUTELY.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.531
THERE AREN'T ANY DEATHS
IN THE HOUSE

01:38.566 --> 01:40.734
BECAUSE THE HOUSE
WAS BUILT IN '82, '83.

01:40.769 --> 01:42.902
THEY BUILT IT,
SO THERE WAS NO HOUSE

01:42.937 --> 01:44.137
ON THIS PROPERTY
BEFORE THEN.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.104
LOOKING AT THE ADDRESS,

01:46.139 --> 01:49.258
THIS PLACE IS
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

01:49.293 --> 01:52.378
NOWHERE. IT IS
ON A LONG ROAD BY ITSELF.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.580
WE ARE NOT WOODSY PEOPLE.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.813
YEAH.

01:55.848 --> 01:57.250
WE NEED TO GET YOU
SOME CAMOUFLAGE CARGO SHORTS.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.350
WHAT IF WE WORE CAMOUFLAGE
IN THE WOODS?

01:59.385 --> 02:02.221
WE WOULD CATCH THE SPIRIT.
THEY WOULDN'T SEE US.

02:02.256 --> 02:05.057
THEY'D BE LIKE
"THAT'S JUST A TREE."

02:05.092 --> 02:07.460
NO?
CHECK, PLEASE.

02:11.263 --> 02:12.598
- HI, GUYS.
- HI!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.100
- HI!
- ADAM, HI!

02:14.135 --> 02:15.567
- MARY.
- MARY. AMY.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.102
COME ON IN.
I'LL SHOW YOU THE HOUSE.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.404
- AFTER YOU.
- THANK YOU.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.572
WELL, THIS IS NICE.

02:21.607 --> 02:24.742
THANK YOU.
BUILT IT OURSELVES.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.613
AND NOW, IS IT JUST YOU HERE
ALL THE TIME?

02:27.648 --> 02:30.415
NO, MY DAUGHTER
LIVES HERE WITH ME

02:30.450 --> 02:32.216
SINCE MY HUSBAND LEFT.

02:32.251 --> 02:33.419
SO IT's JUST
THE TWO OF US.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.618
ALL RIGHT.

02:34.653 --> 02:36.789
SO, WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW
A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR CASE.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.156
BUT WE'D LOVE TO HEAR
ABOUT THE ACTIVITY

02:38.157 --> 02:40.927
AND ABOUT THINGS,
SO TAKE US THROUGH THE HOUSE.

02:40.962 --> 02:43.328
TELL US EVERYTHING.
GIVE US THE HOT SPOTS.

02:44.697 --> 02:47.667
WE DID HAVE AN INCIDENT
THAT HAPPENED HERE.

02:47.702 --> 02:49.600
I CAME HOME FROM WORK ONE DAY.

02:49.635 --> 02:51.971
AND THERE WAS GLASS
AND WOOD SPLINTERS

02:52.006 --> 02:53.839
ALL OVER THE FLOOR HERE.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.607
MARY TOLD ME,

02:55.642 --> 02:57.677
THAT SHE HAD BEEN BACK
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

02:57.712 --> 03:02.465
SHE HEARD A LOUD CRASH,
CAME OUT HERE.

03:02.500 --> 03:07.219
AND THE LIGHT UP THERE...
HAD BROKEN.

03:07.254 --> 03:10.288
THIS ONE?

03:10.323 --> 03:12.623
THE LIGHT WAS THE SAME DESIGN

03:12.658 --> 03:14.660
AS THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE STAIRS.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.959
OKAY.

03:15.994 --> 03:17.696
THEY WERE, LIKE, A SET,
ONLY THIS WAS A SWING LIGHT.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.996
SO THIS WAS SOMETHING?

03:19.031 --> 03:21.165
THIS HAD -- THIS WAS SOMETHING?
- IT WAS, YEAH.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.835
THERE WAS A WOOD BASE
ON THE BOTTOM JUST LIKE THE TOP.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.571
AND YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE
WHERE IT'S RIPPED OFF.

03:28.574 --> 03:31.110
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.

03:31.145 --> 03:33.611
JUST THIS LAST SATURDAY,

03:33.646 --> 03:37.315
I HAD SOMETHING REALLY THAT
KIND OF REALLY FREAKED ME OUT.

03:37.316 --> 03:39.183
WHILE I'M LAYING THERE QUIETLY,

03:39.218 --> 03:43.722
I HEARD FOOTSTEPS START
TO COME INTO THE ROOM.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.657
AND I OPENED MY EYES,
AND IT WAS, LIKE,

03:45.692 --> 03:47.158
STANDING NEXT TO THE BED,

03:47.193 --> 03:50.362
JUST A SMALL FIGURE
WATCHING ME SLEEP.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.629
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

03:51.664 --> 03:55.601
I HEARD THIS LOUD
BREATHY SIGH IN MY EAR.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.903
WHOLE SIDE OF MY BODY
WENT ICE-COLD.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.504
THAT'S REALLY STRANGE.

03:59.539 --> 04:00.773
JUST CHILLS
FROM HEAD TO TOE.

04:06.212 --> 04:10.082
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
MY ONE DAUGHTER CAME TO VISIT.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.317
AND WE WERE
STANDING OVER HERE.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.416
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

04:12.451 --> 04:14.754
I WOULD HEAR VOICES
COME FROM DOWN THE HALL.

04:16.721 --> 04:19.224
- OKAY, SO IN THAT ROOM THERE?
- IT CAME FROM THAT DIRECTION.

04:19.225 --> 04:21.492
YES. AND MY DAUGHTER
LOOKED AT ME.

04:21.527 --> 04:24.563
HER EYES WERE AS BIG AS SAUCERS.
SHE SAID, "DID YOU HEAR THAT?"

04:24.598 --> 04:28.366
THERE WERE TIMES
WHERE I'D BE SITTING HERE

04:28.367 --> 04:31.235
AND LOOKING OUT
THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR

04:31.270 --> 04:34.640
WHERE I WOULD SWEAR I SAW
SOMEBODY OUT THERE STANDING

04:34.675 --> 04:36.776
AGAINST ONE OF THE TREES.

04:42.781 --> 04:46.218
THE TABLE MAKES A VERY DISTINCT
SOUND WHEN YOU MOVE IT.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.254
- RIGHT.
- I WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM.

04:48.289 --> 04:50.221
AND I HEARD THAT NOISE,
THAT CREAK,

04:50.256 --> 04:52.491
LIKE SOMEBODY LEANING UP
AGAINST THE TABLE.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.325
HERE, I WANT TO SEE.

04:54.326 --> 04:56.060
YEAH. OKAY.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.280
IT GIVES THIS CREAK
WHEN YOU MOVE IT.

04:58.315 --> 05:00.465
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
MOVE IT HARD.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.333
JUST LEAN AGAINST IT.

05:02.368 --> 05:05.836
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT COULD WE DO FOR YOU?

05:05.871 --> 05:07.106
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GONNA BE THE IDEAL...

05:07.141 --> 05:10.074
WELL, I THINK
A LOT OF IT WAS FAMILY.

05:10.109 --> 05:13.979
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO
FROM THE FAMILY IS HERE.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.831
WHICH OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS
HAVE PASSED

05:15.866 --> 05:18.259
THAT YOU THINK MIGHT
WANT TO STICK AROUND?

05:18.294 --> 05:20.653
WELL, THE -- THE FIRST
AND FOREMOST, MY SON.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.788
HIS NAME WAS ADAM.
HE DIED AN INFANT.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.558
WE TALKED ON THE PHONE,
AND I'M WONDERING,

05:26.559 --> 05:27.993
YOUR -- YOUR DAUGHTER
GOT SCRATCHED.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.227
- YES.
- RIGHT.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.197
AND YOU GET SCRATCHED, THAT'S
NOT NECESSARILY WELCOMING.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.935
RIGHT. AND THAT CONCERNED ME
BECAUSE I THOUGHT,

05:35.970 --> 05:39.638
"IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE HERE
THAT WE DON'T WANT?"

05:41.840 --> 05:44.275
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

05:44.276 --> 05:46.910
YES.

05:46.945 --> 05:48.780
WHEN WE WERE
STARING OUT AT THE WOODS,

05:48.815 --> 05:50.616
I SAW SOMETHING
MOVE IN THE WOODS.

05:50.651 --> 05:54.385
I DID, TOO.

05:54.386 --> 05:55.421
NEXT TO THE TREE
RIGHT WHERE SHE SAID.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.653
YES.
RIGHT WHERE SHE SAID.

05:56.688 --> 05:58.056
OKAY, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO OVERREACT.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.475
I DIDN'T WANT TO
FREAK HER OUT.

05:59.510 --> 06:00.825
IT WAS WEIRD
'CAUSE I DIDN'T --

06:00.860 --> 06:02.292
I WASN'T TRUSTING
MYSELF COMPLETELY.

06:02.327 --> 06:03.829
YOU STARED, YOU KEPT
LOOKING AT THAT SPOT FOREVER.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.498
I WAS STARING
FOR THE LONGEST TIME.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.765
AND YOU WOULD NOT MOVE.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.116
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

06:08.151 --> 06:09.467
IF MY EYES WERE
PLAYING TRICKS ON ME.

06:09.468 --> 06:11.904
BUT I WAS LIKE, "I KEEP
THINKIN' I'M SEEIN' SOMEBODY,

06:11.939 --> 06:13.606
LIKE A SHADOW, PEAK OUT
FROM BEHIND THAT TREE."

06:13.641 --> 06:16.040
RIGHT. EXACTLY.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAW.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.977
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S
ON THE PROPERTY BACK THERE.

06:19.012 --> 06:19.944
YES, 100%.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.712
SO I WANT TO TALK TO
THE DAUGHTER.

06:21.713 --> 06:23.215
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THE DAUGHTER'S THINKING.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.016
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THE DAUGHTER'S FEELING.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.252
I MEAN, WE NEED TO FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT THE SCRATCHES

06:27.287 --> 06:29.019
AND WHAT TYPE OF SPIRIT
WOULD DO THIS

06:29.054 --> 06:31.957
BEFORE WE START ANY TYPE
OF INVESTIGATION.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.790
SO TOMORROW,
WE HAVE TO HIT IT

06:33.825 --> 06:36.628
VERY, VERY HARD AND GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF WHO'S HERE.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.770
SO TELL ME ABOUT THE SCRATCHES
AND WHERE THEY WERE,

06:44.805 --> 06:46.171
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

06:46.172 --> 06:49.141
OKAY. THE WHOLE STORY OF IT
IS I FELL ASLEEP DOWNSTAIRS

06:49.176 --> 06:50.275
ON THE COUCH WATCHING TV.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.509
WHICH COUCH WAS IT?

06:51.544 --> 06:53.344
IT WAS THE COUCH DOWNSTAIRS.

06:53.345 --> 06:55.014
OKAY. SO YOU WERE
SLEEPING THE LIVING ROOM?

06:55.049 --> 06:57.248
YEAH. YEAH.

06:57.283 --> 07:00.351
AND THE NEXT MORNING
FROM, LIKE,

07:00.386 --> 07:02.888
HERE ON MY LEG TO HERE,
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER,

07:02.923 --> 07:04.489
- THERE WERE, LIKE...
- SO, LIKE, ABOUT A FOOT?

07:04.490 --> 07:05.923
YEAH. THERE WERE, LIKE,
THESE SCRATCHES.

07:05.958 --> 07:09.061
BUT THEY TENDED -- IT WASN'T
JUST LIKE ONE SCRATCH DOWN.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.395
THEY WERE KIND OF,
LIKE, CIRCULAR.

07:10.396 --> 07:11.964
COULD YOU DRAW THEM FOR ME?

07:11.999 --> 07:14.517
PROBABLY, YEAH.

07:14.552 --> 07:17.001
SAY THIS IS MY LEG.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.304
THEY WERE KIND OF
LIKE THIS.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.123
LIKE, IT WASN'T STRAIGHT.

07:21.158 --> 07:22.907
THEY WERE REALLY WEIRD.

07:22.908 --> 07:26.411
OKAY. DO YOU THINK THAT
IT'S FAMILY MEMBERS?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.946
MY MOM ALWAYS THINKS
IT'S FAMILY.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.082
BUT HOW SHOULD I PUT THAT?

07:30.117 --> 07:33.751
IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE

07:33.786 --> 07:39.491
I -- IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE
IT REALLY WASN'T FAMILY.

07:45.764 --> 07:48.534
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES

07:48.569 --> 07:51.204
WHERE IT COULD LITERALLY BE
ANYTHING HERE.

07:51.239 --> 07:53.840
IT'S ALL SUPER DIFFERENT TYPES
OF ACTIVITY.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.392
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

07:56.427 --> 07:58.910
WE NEED SOME VERY CLEAR,
DISTINCT ANSWERS

07:58.945 --> 08:01.780
TO GIVE TO CATHERINE.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.152
THE MORE I TALK TO
THE FAMILY, THE MORE I FEEL LIKE

08:07.187 --> 08:09.753
WE'RE DEALING
WITH A MUCH DARKER SPIRIT.

08:09.788 --> 08:12.474
WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED
FOR TONIGHT'S INVESTIGATION,

08:12.509 --> 08:15.160
SETTING UP CAMERAS INSIDE
AND OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.930
SO, ADAM IS SETTING UP
A TRAIL CAM OUT HERE

08:19.965 --> 08:23.935
JUST BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN
A SHADOW FIGURE IN THIS AREA.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.671
THE GAME CAMERAS
ARE I.R. CAMERAS

08:25.706 --> 08:27.104
THAT ARE MOTION-ACTIVATED.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.775
SO THEY'RE MEANT FOR, LIKE,
SPOTTING WILDLIFE.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.410
SO IF SOMETHING MOVES
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA,

08:32.446 --> 08:35.280
IT WILL RECORD FOR ONE MINUTE.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:50.762 --> 08:55.065
SO IF YOU'RE IN HERE,
MY NAME IS ADAM. THIS IS AMY.

08:55.066 --> 08:58.101
SO WHOEVER'S HERE WITH US,

08:58.136 --> 09:00.272
YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT SHY
WHEN CATHERINE IS HERE,

09:00.273 --> 09:02.441
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SHY AROUND US.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.443
WE DEFINITELY
WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

09:04.478 --> 09:07.630
WE DEFINITELY WANT TO
TALK TO YOU.

09:07.665 --> 09:10.782
SO, ARE YOU RELATED
TO CATHERINE?

09:15.353 --> 09:17.689
DID YOU SCRATCH MARY ONCE?

09:21.660 --> 09:24.896
IS THERE SOMEONE HERE
NAMED ADAM...

09:24.897 --> 09:27.115
BESIDES THIS ADAM?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.299
IS THERE ANOTHER ADAM?

09:29.334 --> 09:32.637
JUST GET OUR ATTENTION BY, LIKE,
KNOCKING OR WALKING AROUND.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.646
IS THERE ANYONE HERE
WITH THE LAST NAME...

09:43.014 --> 09:45.283
IS THAT THAT TABLE?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.086
WE NEED TO GO SEE IT.

10:03.068 --> 10:07.740
JUST GET OUR ATTENTION BY, LIKE,
KNOCKING OR WALKING AROUND.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.575
IS THERE ANYONE HERE
WITH THE LAST NAME...

10:12.244 --> 10:14.913
IS THAT THAT TABLE?

10:20.218 --> 10:22.820
SO WE THOUGHT WE HEARD
A NOISE IN HERE,

10:22.821 --> 10:24.923
WHICH IS WHY WE MOVED OVER.

10:26.392 --> 10:29.845
SO CAN YOU KNOCK
ON THIS TABLE OR --

10:29.880 --> 10:33.263
OR MAKE SOME
SORT OF SOUND FOR US.

10:33.298 --> 10:36.268
IF YOU'RE NOT RELATED
TO CATHERINE, THAT'S OKAY.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.839
SHE JUST WANTS TO KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.695
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TRY THIS ONE MORE TIME,

10:46.730 --> 10:48.280
AND THEN, WE'LL MOVE ON
TO THE OTHER ONE.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.935
QUIET.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.072
YOU WANT TO GO
INTO THAT OTHER ROOM?

11:13.107 --> 11:15.106
THE GUEST ROOM,
THE SPARE ROOM?

11:15.141 --> 11:16.072
YEP.

11:16.107 --> 11:17.642
YEAH. I THINK WE
SHOULD TRY IT.

11:29.822 --> 11:33.775
THIS IS AMY AND ADAM,
WE ARE IN CATHERINE'S HOUSE,

11:33.810 --> 11:37.728
AND WE ARE IN THE GUEST ROOM
WHERE SHE HEARD VOICES.

11:37.729 --> 11:40.499
HAVE YOU BROKEN THINGS
IN THE HOUSE BEFORE?

11:43.702 --> 11:47.273
WHOEVER'S IN HERE, DO YOU
LIKE CATHERINE AND MARY?

11:49.642 --> 11:52.610
DO YOU SOMETIMES
WATCH FROM THE WOODS

11:52.645 --> 11:56.615
AND LOOK INTO THE HOUSE
TO WATCH CATHERINE AND MARY?

11:58.750 --> 12:01.287
LET'S SEE.

12:18.937 --> 12:21.073
YES!

12:33.053 --> 12:34.518
MNH-MNH.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.455
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO NEXT?

12:36.490 --> 12:38.555
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S ODD.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.860
WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHY, LIKE,
IT WATCHES THEM FROM THE WOODS.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.894
I KNOW.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.564
I NEED TO GO RESEARCH
THE DEED, LAND,

12:46.565 --> 12:47.999
SEE WHAT ELSE WAS
ON THIS PROPERTY.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.434
SO I'M GONNA GO TO
THE LIBRARY.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.202
LET'S PACK UP.

12:51.237 --> 12:54.406
BUT FIRST, LET'S GO
INVESTIGATE THE WOODS.

12:55.874 --> 12:58.577
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AGAIN?

13:06.117 --> 13:11.290
ANYONE OUT HERE?

13:13.892 --> 13:19.799
IS THERE ANYONE HERE WHO WATCHES
THESE HOUSES FROM THE WOODS?

13:26.671 --> 13:28.605
OVER HERE.

13:28.640 --> 13:32.276
SOMETHING MADE A SOUND.

13:40.185 --> 13:43.488
PROBABLY NOT USED TO
PEOPLE BEING OUT HERE AT NIGHT.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.290
DO YOU WANT US
TO LEAVE?

13:51.797 --> 13:54.765
WHAT'S THAT?

13:56.835 --> 13:58.470
IS IT RAINING?

14:00.374 --> 14:02.139
NO.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.641
WHAT IS THAT?
IT SOUNDS LIKE RAIN.

14:03.642 --> 14:04.775
YEAH.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.145
THERE'S NOTHING FALLING,
THOUGH.

14:10.816 --> 14:13.168
THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH
GOING ON HERE.

14:13.203 --> 14:15.520
WE HAVE TO PROCESS
A LOT OF INFORMATION.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.691
LET'S HEAD IN.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.135
THE ACTIVITY IN
THE GUEST ROOM MAKES ME THINK

14:32.170 --> 14:36.373
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH A FAMILY
MEMBER, BUT SOMETHING ELSE.

14:36.374 --> 14:39.545
WHILE ADAM'S GOING TO RESEARCH
THE LAND'S HISTORY...

14:39.580 --> 14:41.581
I WANT TO DO SOME RESEARCH
ON A PROPERTY

14:41.616 --> 14:43.316
THAT IS NEARBY
IN LITTLE MEADOWS, PA.

14:43.351 --> 14:45.385
...I'M GOING TO TALK
TO CATHERINE

14:45.420 --> 14:47.384
TO HEAR MORE
ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.353
I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS

14:49.354 --> 14:52.190
ABOUT THINGS THAT CAN HELP US
WHEN WE'RE INVESTIGATING.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.510
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WERE,
LIKE, A FEW,

14:54.545 --> 14:56.795
JUST THE BIGGEST THING
OR THINGS HERE

14:56.830 --> 14:58.895
THAT WERE MAYBE NOT FAMILY,

14:58.930 --> 15:01.065
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE
DISCONCERTING?

15:01.066 --> 15:04.937
WELL, ONE TIME,
I WOKE UP DURING THE NIGHT.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.105
AND THERE WAS, LIKE,
A SHADOW PERSON

15:07.140 --> 15:09.172
JUST WATCHING ME SLEEP.

15:09.207 --> 15:12.176
AND THIS WASN'T THE SIZE
OF ANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.045
IT WAS MORE LIKE A CHILD.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.447
HAVE YOU HAD
ANY OTHER ACTIVITY

15:16.482 --> 15:20.618
THAT MIGHT POINT TO, LIKE,
A CHILD-TYPE SPIRIT?

15:20.619 --> 15:21.985
WE DID.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.356
THERE WAS A LITTLE TOY
BLACK &amp; DECKER BENCH

15:24.391 --> 15:27.359
HERE ON THE PORCH
THAT WAS MY GRANDSON'S.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.492
AND MARY HEARD IT
MAKING A SOUND.

15:29.527 --> 15:32.531
AND SHE CAME OUT TO LOOK, AND
THERE WAS A LITTLE SAW BLADE,

15:32.566 --> 15:34.766
AND SHE SAID
THAT WAS TURNING.

15:37.236 --> 15:41.872
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
SORT OF A CHILDLIKE-TYPE THING.

15:41.873 --> 15:44.209
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF WE
CAME BACK AND WE JUST --

15:44.244 --> 15:46.545
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
IT'S YOUR FAMILY?

15:46.580 --> 15:49.414
WELL, SOMEBODY
THAT DOESN'T KNOW ME,

15:49.449 --> 15:51.516
WHY WOULD THEY CHOOSE
MY HOME?

15:55.520 --> 15:58.855
CATHERINE'S VERY INTENT
ON THIS BEING HER FAMILY.

15:58.890 --> 16:03.028
BUT A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES
THAT SHE DESCRIBED IS CHILDLIKE.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.795
ADAM WAS ONLY 4 DAYS OLD
WHEN HE PASSED AWAY.

16:05.830 --> 16:09.300
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE
WOULD BE A CHILD SPIRIT THERE.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.203
I REALLY DON'T.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.292
IN MY RESEARCH,
I HAVE DISCOVERED

16:17.327 --> 16:20.471
THAT THE ASHCRAFT FAMILY
OWNED THIS LAND

16:20.506 --> 16:23.178
BEFORE CATHERINE AND HER FAMILY
BOUGHT IT.

16:23.213 --> 16:25.851
I'M GONNA DO A TON
OF RESEARCH TO FIND OUT,

16:25.886 --> 16:27.784
DID THEY DIE HERE?

16:27.819 --> 16:29.921
AND HOPEFULLY,
WE'LL GET SOME ANSWERS.

16:34.192 --> 16:39.798
SO FAR WHAT I'VE GOT,
FRED ASHCRAFT JR.,

16:39.833 --> 16:41.701
LITTLE MEADOWS, PA.

16:41.736 --> 16:43.569
HE HAD A DAUGHTER.

16:46.204 --> 16:48.638
GOD.

16:48.673 --> 16:54.145
SHE DIED WHEN SHE WAS 3,
JUNE 5, 1942.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.348
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DIED.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.553
ACCIDENT.

17:13.231 --> 17:17.336
SO FAR WHAT I'VE GOT,

17:17.371 --> 17:19.472
FRED ASHCRAFT JR.,

17:19.507 --> 17:22.025
LITTLE MEADOWS, PA.

17:22.060 --> 17:24.285
HE HAD A DAUGHTER.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.476
VIEW THIS THING.

17:26.511 --> 17:29.648
LUCINDA BARBARA ASHCRAFT.

17:33.485 --> 17:36.054
GOD. ACCIDENT.

17:38.790 --> 17:41.626
SHE WAS CUT IN HALF.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.427
THAT'S REALLY HORRIBLE.

17:44.462 --> 17:46.798
BARBARA, 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
WAS INSTANTLY KILLED

17:46.833 --> 17:50.903
FRIDAY AFTERNOON
IN HER FATHER'S SAWMILL.

17:50.938 --> 17:54.938
THE CHILD WALKED DIRECTLY
INTO A MOVING SAW.

17:54.973 --> 17:59.043
I DISCOVERED THAT A LITTLE GIRL
HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.410
DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

18:00.445 --> 18:02.112
WITH THE ACTIVITY
THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE?

18:02.113 --> 18:04.214
I'M NOT SURE YET.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.836
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE
THE SAWMILL WAS LOCATED

18:07.871 --> 18:11.388
IN ACCORDANCE TO THE WHERE
THE PROPERTY IS,

18:11.423 --> 18:18.363
'CAUSE IF SHE BUILT HER HOME
WHERE THE SAWMILL SAT...

18:18.398 --> 18:21.733
THAT'S CRAZY.

18:31.977 --> 18:34.179
I'M GONNA REACH OUT
TO A DESCENDANT OF THE ASHCRAFTS

18:34.214 --> 18:36.415
TO GET MORE INFORMATION
ON THIS TRAGEDY.

18:38.683 --> 18:41.419
I THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT
BECAUSE I WANTED TO JUST,

18:41.454 --> 18:44.923
YOU KNOW, TALK TO A FAMILY
MEMBER OF THE ASHCRAFTS.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.393
SO, CAN YOU, UM, TELL ME
A GENERAL HISTORY OF THE LAND?

18:48.428 --> 18:50.179
MY GRANDFATHER
OWNED THIS ENTIRE ROAD.

18:50.214 --> 18:51.930
SO HE OWNED THIS WHOLE
ENTIRE SPACE?

18:51.965 --> 18:52.962
YEAH. YEP.

18:52.997 --> 18:54.399
HE OWNED A SAWMILL, YEAH?

18:55.667 --> 18:58.334
UNFORTUNATELY, I DISCOVERED
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER,

18:58.369 --> 19:01.238
THE 3-YEAR-OLD, LUCINDA,
WHO WAS KILLED IN THE ACCIDENT.

19:01.239 --> 19:02.805
YES.

19:02.840 --> 19:07.512
DID HE, UM, - DID HE
EVER TALK ABOUT LUCINDA?

19:07.547 --> 19:09.246
THAT WAS NEVER MENTIONED
BY EITHER OF THEM.

19:09.247 --> 19:10.313
THAT WAS NEVER MENTIONED?

19:10.348 --> 19:11.848
BY EITHER OF
MY GRANDPARENTS. NO.

19:11.883 --> 19:13.585
- OKAY.
- I KNOW ABOUT IT THROUGH MY MOM.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.887
AND MY MOM, UM, LUCINDA
PASSED YEARS

19:15.922 --> 19:17.821
BEFORE MY MOM
WAS EVEN BORN.

19:17.856 --> 19:20.008
IT'S DEVASTATING.
IT'S DEVASTATING.

19:20.043 --> 19:22.160
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY THEY DIDN'T,

19:22.195 --> 19:24.194
YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT IT.

19:24.229 --> 19:27.298
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE CATHERINE
IS HAVING SOME ACTIVITY

19:27.333 --> 19:28.665
IN HER HOUSE
WHICH SHE CANNOT EXPLAIN.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.635
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL
THE POSSIBILITIES AND OPTIONS.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.522
AND TO KNOW WHERE
THAT SAWMILL WAS LOCATED

19:33.557 --> 19:36.374
IN ACCORDANCE TO WHERE
SHE BUILT HER PROPERTY

19:36.409 --> 19:38.808
MIGHT HELP US.

19:38.843 --> 19:42.347
THERE WAS ONE, I BELIEVE,
NOT FAR BACK BEHIND HERE,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.116
STRAIGHT DOWN THROUGH
THE HILL THAT WAY.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.551
LUCINDA DIED
NEAR THE PROPERTY

19:47.586 --> 19:51.155
AND I AM WORRIED HOW AMY IS
GOING TO TAKE THIS INFORMATION.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.175
SHE HAS A DAUGHTER THE SAME AGE

19:53.210 --> 19:55.125
AS THIS LITTLE GIRL
WHEN SHE DIED.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.228
WHEN YOU'RE A MOTHER,
IT HITS YOU AT YOUR GUT.

19:58.263 --> 20:01.832
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT,
THAT REALLY, REALLY AFFECTS HER.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.766
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS OUR JOB.

20:03.801 --> 20:06.972
AND WE NEED TO USE
THIS INFORMATION TO INVESTIGATE.

20:12.110 --> 20:13.476
I WENT TO THE LIBRARY.

20:13.511 --> 20:15.513
I DID SOME RESEARCH
ABOUT THE PROPERTY

20:15.548 --> 20:17.781
AND WHO LIVED HERE BEFORE.

20:17.816 --> 20:22.654
AND I FOUND OUT THAT
FRED ASHCRAFT OWNED THIS LAND.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.123
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.

20:28.627 --> 20:31.830
IT'S -- IT'S KIND OF, UM,
IT'S INTENSE INFORMATION

20:31.865 --> 20:33.964
OKAY.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.900
THAT IS A DEATH CERTIFICATE.

20:36.934 --> 20:41.340
FOR THEIR LITTLE DAUGHTER,
LUCINDA.

20:47.212 --> 20:50.415
THIS LITTLE GIRL'S LITERALLY
THE EXACT AGE OF MY DAUGHTER

20:50.450 --> 20:51.948
DOWN TO THE MONTH.
- RIGHT.

20:51.983 --> 20:54.851
LIKE, EXACTLY CHARLOTTE'S AGE.
IT'S SO SAD.

20:54.852 --> 20:56.387
HONESTLY, IT'S THE FIRST THING
I THOUGHT OF

20:56.422 --> 20:58.588
WHEN I FOUND
THE INFORMATION.

20:58.623 --> 21:00.825
WELL, YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED
TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.925
BUT...

21:02.960 --> 21:06.965
I MEAN, IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME.
IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME PERIOD.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.868
SO I INTERVIEWED
FRED'S GRANDDAUGHTER.

21:09.903 --> 21:12.736
I ASKED HER, UM,
WHERE WAS THIS SAWMILL.

21:12.737 --> 21:14.004
YEAH.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.576
SHE SAID THAT IT'S DOWN
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL.

21:17.611 --> 21:20.211
SO IT'S, LIKE,
REALLY CLOSE TO HERE.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.711
READING THIS AND KNOWING

21:21.746 --> 21:25.016
THE HISTORY OF WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE SAWMILL,

21:25.051 --> 21:26.315
IT'S REALLY STRANGE,
ACTUALLY.

21:26.350 --> 21:29.387
CATHERINE TOLD ME SOME ACTIVITY
THAT SHE HAD EXPERIENCED

21:29.422 --> 21:32.908
THAT SHE HADN'T MENTIONED
TO US IN THE TOUR.

21:32.943 --> 21:36.394
I GUESS, AT ONE POINT,
THERE'S A LITTLE TOY,

21:36.429 --> 21:38.127
TOOL BENCH OUTSIDE.

21:38.162 --> 21:42.333
AND THE SAW THAT'S ON IT,
IT HAS A LITTLE TABLE SAW.

21:43.334 --> 21:45.203
IT STARTED GOING ON
BY ITSELF.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.881
IT'S REALLY STRANGE ACTIVITY
TO HAVE HAPPENED.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.116
TO CULMINATE WITH THIS?

21:58.151 --> 22:00.419
YEAH.

22:11.730 --> 22:14.933
AFTER ADAM TOLD ME THAT,
IT JUST PUT THIS WHOLE NEW SIDE

22:14.968 --> 22:18.537
TO THE CASE THAT JUST BECAME
A LOT MORE INTENSE FOR ME,

22:18.572 --> 22:19.936
I FEEL LIKE.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.606
I JUST CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK OF MY DAUGHTER.

22:22.641 --> 22:26.678
AND JUST TO THINK OF SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

22:26.713 --> 22:27.811
BUT I THINK THAT, ULTIMATELY,

22:27.846 --> 22:30.015
IT COULD HELP ME TALK
TO THIS LITTLE GIRL

22:30.050 --> 22:32.184
JUST 'CAUSE I CAN RELATE
TO A CHILD THAT AGE.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.456
HOPEFULLY TONIGHT,
WE CAN FIND OUT

22:40.491 --> 22:42.761
IF WE'RE DEALING WITH
A FAMILY MEMBER OF CATHERINE'S

22:42.796 --> 22:45.764
LIKE HER SON, ADAM,
OR THE SPIRIT OF LUCINDA.

22:50.401 --> 22:55.674
WHOEVER IS IN HERE WITH US,
MY NAME IS AMY.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.840
AND THIS IS ADAM.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.710
AND WE ARE GUESTS
OF CATHERINE'S.

23:00.745 --> 23:04.916
AND SHE'S ASKED US TO COME IN
AND TRY TO TALK TO YOU.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.851
SO YOU'RE NOT
IN ANY TROUBLE.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.821
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET
SOME ANSWERS FOR HER.

23:11.790 --> 23:13.256
IF YOU'RE A LITTLE ONE,

23:13.291 --> 23:17.095
YOU MIGHT LIKE
OUR BEAR FRIEND HERE.

23:17.130 --> 23:20.763
WE'LL SET HIM OVER HERE.

23:20.798 --> 23:23.902
<i> HI, I'M BooBuddy.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?</i>

23:23.937 --> 23:26.604
WE HAVE A BEAR.
HIS NAME IS BooBuddy.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.538
WE BRING THAT ON CASES

23:28.573 --> 23:31.209
WHERE WE FEEL AS THOUGH
THERE MIGHT BE A CHILD SPIRIT.

23:31.244 --> 23:34.479
AND AS THEY INTERACT
WITH IT, IT REACTS.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.978
IT HAS A BUILT-IN EMF METER.

23:36.013 --> 23:41.351
IT HAS A TEMPERATURE SENSOR,
AND A VIBRATION SENSOR.

23:41.352 --> 23:45.791
<i> COUNT WITH ME.
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.</i>

23:48.659 --> 23:50.644
I'M GONNA START THIS.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.630
ARE YOU FILMING THAT?

23:57.668 --> 24:01.206
DO YOU EVER PLAY WITH THESE
BEARS THAT ARE IN HERE?

24:02.540 --> 24:04.140
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

24:04.175 --> 24:07.378
BUT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH OUR BEAR FRIEND HERE,

24:07.413 --> 24:09.714
FEEL FREE.

24:13.752 --> 24:16.186
YOU CAN GIVE IT
A BIG HUG.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.972
- YEAH, GO AHEAD.
- YOU CAN TAKE IT.

24:18.007 --> 24:19.724
YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT
ALL YOU WANT.

24:24.162 --> 24:26.698
ARE YOU RELATED
TO CATHERINE SOMEHOW?

24:31.770 --> 24:34.004
IS THERE SOMEONE HERE
NAMED LUCINDA?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.582
<i>THAT TICKLES!</i>

24:47.118 --> 24:48.785
DID IT JUST TOUCH IT,
THAT BEAR?

24:48.786 --> 24:51.022
SOMETHING JUST TOUCHED IT.

24:58.430 --> 25:01.264
<i>THAT TICKLES!</i>

25:01.299 --> 25:03.368
SOMETHING KEEPS TOUCHING IT.
KEEP RECORDING.

25:12.777 --> 25:15.863
DID THE BEAR JUST MOVE?

25:15.898 --> 25:18.792
I DON'T KNOW. DID IT?

25:18.827 --> 25:21.686
THAT BEAR JUST MOVED.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.966
<i>THAT TICKLES!</i>

25:39.270 --> 25:40.972
DID THAT BEAR JUST MOVE?

25:43.610 --> 25:46.108
WHAT?

25:46.143 --> 25:48.780
I DON'T KNOW. DID IT?

25:49.814 --> 25:51.950
I DIDN'T NOTICE IT MOVING.

25:53.484 --> 25:55.852
OR AM I JUST, LIKE,
SEEING THINGS?

25:55.853 --> 25:57.822
WELL, YOU HAVE THE CAMERA.

26:00.859 --> 26:03.226
SHOULD I LOOK BACK
ON THIS THING?

26:03.261 --> 26:04.912
YEAH. BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE SECOND YOU DO,

26:04.947 --> 26:06.564
IT'S GONNA SAY
IT'S GETTING TOUCHED.

26:06.599 --> 26:07.530
I KNOW.

26:07.565 --> 26:08.749
I MEAN,
WE COULD JUST REVIEW IT.

26:08.784 --> 26:09.934
YEAH,
LET'S REVIEW IT LATER.

26:25.383 --> 26:28.619
I DON'T KNOW.

26:28.654 --> 26:32.555
MNH-MNH.

26:32.556 --> 26:35.659
I MEAN, I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW,
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO GO ON.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.927
YEAH. WE HAVE
A FIGURE DOWNSTAIRS

26:37.962 --> 26:40.297
THAT MIGHT BE THE ONE
WATCHING FROM THE WOODS.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.965
SO THAT'S INTERESTING.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.433
WE CAN CHECK THE TRAIL CAMS.

26:43.468 --> 26:46.204
I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT TO SAY 100%

26:46.239 --> 26:47.603
THAT A LITTLE GIRL IS HERE.

26:47.638 --> 26:51.341
BUT SOMETHING WAS
MANIPULATING THE BEAR.

26:51.342 --> 26:53.477
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
CHECK OUT THAT FOOTAGE.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.447
YEAH. FOR SURE.

27:06.323 --> 27:09.360
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING
ON THE TRAIL CAMS?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.161
NOTHING. NOPE.

27:11.162 --> 27:12.931
IT WENT OFF ONCE
WHEN I WAS SETTING IT UP

27:12.966 --> 27:15.266
AND ONCE WHEN I WAS
TAKING IT DOWN.

27:17.568 --> 27:18.969
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING
REALLY QUICK.

27:19.004 --> 27:21.437
I WAS LOOKING AT THE BEAR
UPSTAIRS IN THE MASTER BEDROOM.

27:21.438 --> 27:23.575
AND REMEMBER I WAS LIKE,
"DID THAT BEAR JUST MOVE?"

27:23.610 --> 27:25.575
RIGHT.

27:25.610 --> 27:26.844
<i> DID THAT BEAR JUST MOVE?</i>

27:26.845 --> 27:29.748
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
DO IT AGAIN.

27:37.422 --> 27:39.089
<i> DID THAT BEAR JUST MOVE?</i>

27:39.124 --> 27:43.259
- DID NOT MOVE.
- IT CLEARLY DID NOT MOVE.

27:43.294 --> 27:45.563
I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO REVIEW
THE REST OF THIS EVIDENCE

27:45.598 --> 27:47.698
AND SEE IF I CAN CATCH
ANYTHING ELSE.

27:47.733 --> 27:49.633
I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE CLOSE

27:49.668 --> 27:52.235
TO THE SOLUTION
ON THIS ONE AT ALL.

27:52.270 --> 27:58.143
AND WE HAVE SO MANY OPTIONS
BETWEEN LUCINDA AND...

27:58.178 --> 27:59.742
FAMILY.
- ...FAMILY,

27:59.777 --> 28:03.380
WHATEVER'S OUT IN THE WOODS,
WHATEVER'S IN THAT ROOM,

28:03.415 --> 28:05.715
I MEAN, ALL OF THAT,

28:05.750 --> 28:08.219
WE STILL DON'T HAVE
A CLEAR ANSWER

28:08.254 --> 28:10.355
AS TO WHAT IS
DEFINITIVELY HERE

28:10.390 --> 28:12.456
OR IF IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.457
I'VE GOTTEN NO SENSE

28:14.458 --> 28:15.926
THAT HER FAMILY MEMBERS
ARE HERE RIGHT NOW.

28:15.961 --> 28:17.360
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:17.361 --> 28:19.097
WELL, LET'S INVESTIGATE WITH HER
TONIGHT FOR A LITTLE BIT.

28:19.132 --> 28:20.163
YEAH.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.266
GETTING HER IN THERE
MIGHT BE THE PUSH WE NEED

28:22.301 --> 28:24.434
TO GET THEM TO TALK TO US.

28:24.469 --> 28:27.355
I'M JUST HOPING TONIGHT
WHEN WE INVESTIGATE,

28:27.390 --> 28:30.241
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT TIES IT ALL UP.

28:37.615 --> 28:39.700
ADAM,
DON'T TOUCH THE FIRE.

28:39.735 --> 28:41.461
DON'T TOUCH THE FIRE.
NO.

28:41.496 --> 28:43.076
YOU ARE NOT
A CAMPER.

28:43.111 --> 28:44.621
THIS IS NOT
A BONFIRE.

28:44.656 --> 28:47.158
THIS IS A VERY PLEASANT,
SMALL FIRE.

28:48.592 --> 28:50.544
SO TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT

28:50.579 --> 28:52.496
WE WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU TO COME IN

28:52.497 --> 28:54.132
AND INVESTIGATE WITH US
FOR A WHILE.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.798
I WOULD LOVE
TO DO THAT.

28:55.833 --> 28:58.234
WE'RE THINKING
THAT YOUR FAMILY

28:58.269 --> 29:01.389
MIGHT RESPOND BETTER TO YOU
THAN THEY WOULD TO US.

29:01.424 --> 29:04.509
YOU TRUST US TO BE IN YOUR HOUSE
AND INVESTIGATE,

29:04.544 --> 29:05.942
WHICH WE REALLY APPRECIATE,

29:05.977 --> 29:08.212
BUT WE ALSO WANT
TO INTERACT WITH YOU

29:08.247 --> 29:09.612
ON THAT
KIND OF LEVEL

29:09.647 --> 29:14.350
AND SEE IF THE ACTIVITY
INCREASES OR DECREASES.

29:14.385 --> 29:17.488
YOU DO STRONGLY FEEL THAT
THERE IS FAMILY HERE, RIGHT?

29:17.523 --> 29:18.754
RIGHT, EXACTLY.

29:18.789 --> 29:20.991
FOR ME TONIGHT --
OUR BIGGEST GOAL FOR ME TONIGHT

29:21.026 --> 29:22.525
IS TO REALLY
CONTACT YOUR FAMILY.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.794
I'D LOVE TO GET THAT ON TAPE,
GET SOME EVPs,

29:25.829 --> 29:29.500
AND I THINK WE'RE NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT ALONE

29:29.535 --> 29:30.967
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FAMILY.

29:31.002 --> 29:34.405
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST EXCITED
TO BE IN THERE WITH YOU

29:34.440 --> 29:35.872
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

29:35.907 --> 29:38.359
MAYBE WE'LL GET
SOME MORE RESPONSES.

29:38.394 --> 29:40.811
SO SHALL WE
GO INSIDE, THEN?

29:40.846 --> 29:41.879
GET STARTED?

29:48.853 --> 29:51.855
THIS IS AMY,
ADAM, AND CATHERINE

29:51.890 --> 29:54.157
IN CATHERINE'S ROOM.

29:54.192 --> 29:58.694
SO IF ANYONE ELSE
IS IN HERE BESIDES US,

29:58.729 --> 30:02.000
YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN HERE
TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.

30:02.035 --> 30:05.670
AND WE BROUGHT CATHERINE
WITH US TONIGHT.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.310
ARE YOU RELATED
TO CATHERINE?

30:18.916 --> 30:21.019
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

30:23.654 --> 30:26.090
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

30:27.925 --> 30:30.261
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO YOU ARE?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.831
YOU MY FAMILY?

30:34.965 --> 30:39.203
IF IT IS YOU, ADAM,
I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE.

30:39.238 --> 30:43.340
I HEAR YOU EVERY NIGHT IN HERE.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.043
IS THIS A PICTURE OF HIM?

30:45.078 --> 30:47.445
YES. THAT'S HIM.

30:51.081 --> 30:54.718
HE LOOKS SO SWEET.

30:54.719 --> 30:57.121
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

31:01.258 --> 31:02.892
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.895
<i> ARE YOU RELATED
TO CATHERINE?</i>

31:04.930 --> 31:07.129
NO.

31:07.164 --> 31:08.864
<i> WHY ARE YOU HERE?</i>

31:12.171 --> 31:14.706
COME ON. WHAT IS THAT?!

31:32.256 --> 31:34.626
NO.

31:38.129 --> 31:40.863
COME ON. WHAT IS THAT?!

31:40.898 --> 31:43.668
IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE,
"ADAM."

31:45.303 --> 31:47.002
GO BACK.

31:47.037 --> 31:48.606
HE'S SAYING, "ADAM."

31:49.440 --> 31:50.891
ADAM. IT'S ADAM.

31:50.926 --> 31:52.308
THAT IS ADAM.

31:52.343 --> 31:55.313
I MEAN, THAT'S ON TOP
OF THE MICROPHONE.

31:58.015 --> 31:59.951
LET'S KEEP GOING.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.287
- THAT WAS AN ANSWER.
- YEAH.

32:04.288 --> 32:06.323
SOUNDS LIKE 33.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.042
ADAM WOULD BE 33.

32:08.077 --> 32:09.726
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

32:09.727 --> 32:12.764
WAIT. HE WAS BORN
33 YEARS AGO?

32:12.799 --> 32:13.798
YEAH.

32:16.700 --> 32:17.967
-33.
-33.

32:18.002 --> 32:20.921
I WASN'T SURE
IF THE FIRST EVP TONIGHT

32:20.956 --> 32:23.806
WAS REFERRING TO OUR ADAM
OR CATHERINE'S SON.

32:23.841 --> 32:27.410
BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE A SECOND
EVP POINTING TOWARDS HER SON,

32:27.411 --> 32:30.581
IT MAKES ME THINK WE ARE
COMMUNICATING WITH HIM.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.216
IT'S ANSWERING, "ADAM."
IT SAID, "33."

32:33.217 --> 32:36.287
I MEAN,
THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

32:36.322 --> 32:40.189
I'VE GOT GOOSE BUMPS.

32:40.224 --> 32:41.524
YOU KNOW, IT'S --
IT'S REALLY GREAT

32:41.559 --> 32:45.463
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO CAPTURE...
JUST SOMETHING.

32:45.498 --> 32:46.428
YEAH.

32:46.463 --> 32:47.547
AND YOU GOT
TO BE THERE FOR THAT.

32:47.582 --> 32:48.607
I DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED

32:48.642 --> 32:49.633
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
IN HERE WITH US.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.367
- IT MIGHT NOT HAVE.
- NO.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.954
GETTING THOSE EVPs WAS INTENSE.

32:53.989 --> 32:56.315
BUT THERE IS STILL
A LOT OF ACTIVITY HERE

32:56.350 --> 32:58.897
THAT I DON'T THINK
IS A LOVING FAMILY MEMBER.

32:58.932 --> 33:01.556
SO WE STILL HAVE A LOT
OF INVESTIGATING TO DO.

33:01.591 --> 33:04.181
WELL, I THINK WE NEED TO
GET TO THE OTHER PARTS.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.734
WE DEFINITELY
WANT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS

33:06.769 --> 33:08.845
AND FIND OUT WHO ELSE
IS IN THE HOUSE.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.887
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
CHECK OUT THAT ROOM.

33:10.922 --> 33:13.857
CAN I GO INTO THE BACK ROOM
WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO IN?

33:13.892 --> 33:15.691
WELL, YES.

33:15.726 --> 33:17.059
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN.

33:17.094 --> 33:18.896
THERE'S SOME INFORMATION
THAT WE WANT TO FIND OUT

33:18.931 --> 33:20.430
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO,
LIKE, TELL YOU,

33:20.465 --> 33:23.735
BECAUSE IF WE TELL YOU AND IT
TURNS OUT TO BE NOT CORRECT

33:23.770 --> 33:25.101
BASED ON OUR INVESTIGATION,

33:25.102 --> 33:26.820
DON'T WANT YOU TO EVER
THINK ABOUT IT.

33:26.855 --> 33:28.539
WHY DON'T WE DO FOR
LIKE 5 OR 10 MINUTES?

33:28.574 --> 33:30.708
- YEAH. OKAY.
- YEAH. LET'S.

33:36.714 --> 33:38.149
I'LL SIT OVER HERE.

33:39.317 --> 33:42.186
ALL RIGHT.
SO WE ARE IN THE SPARE ROOM.

33:42.221 --> 33:46.124
IT'S ADAM, MYSELF,
AND CATHERINE.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.694
ARE YOU A CHILD?

33:54.565 --> 33:56.968
DO I KNOW YOU?

34:01.572 --> 34:03.975
ARE YOU LOST?

34:06.711 --> 34:09.147
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT.

34:19.790 --> 34:21.659
WHAT WAS THAT?

34:23.293 --> 34:25.827
I AM?

34:25.862 --> 34:28.764
LOST? THAT'S SAD.

34:28.799 --> 34:30.266
"ARE YOU LOST?"
"I AM."

34:30.301 --> 34:31.400
THAT'S REALLY SAD.

34:31.435 --> 34:33.504
IT SOUNDED FEMALE TO ME.

34:39.043 --> 34:40.742
I FEEL LIKE WE MIGHT
BE PICKING UP

34:40.777 --> 34:43.947
ON THE SPIRIT OF LUCINDA,
BUT UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE,

34:43.982 --> 34:46.216
I DON'T WANT CATHERINE
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.614
SO WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME PRIVACY

34:47.650 --> 34:49.185
TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS
AND, HOPEFULLY,

34:49.186 --> 34:51.253
GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF THIS HAUNTING.

34:51.288 --> 34:54.858
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO START
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT STUFF

34:54.893 --> 34:56.792
THAT KNOW WE KNOW.
- YEAH.

34:56.827 --> 34:59.262
THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT
TO TELL YOU.

34:59.297 --> 35:01.799
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
GIVING US YOUR HOUSE AGAIN

35:01.834 --> 35:03.532
FOR ONE MORE NIGHT?
- OKAY.

35:03.567 --> 35:05.452
AND TOMORROW,
WE ARE GOING TO SHARE

35:05.487 --> 35:07.338
A BUNCH OF INFORMATION
WITH YOU.

35:15.412 --> 35:17.214
IT'S TALKING.
LET'S KEEP RECORDING.

35:19.550 --> 35:22.353
DO YOU KNOW
THE LAST NAME ASHCRAFT?

35:25.589 --> 35:27.892
ARE YOU A LITTLE GIRL?

35:31.328 --> 35:33.231
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

35:49.747 --> 35:52.383
YES.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.763
IT'S TWO SYLLABLES.

36:05.798 --> 36:07.165
LUCY.

36:26.383 --> 36:28.352
IT'S TWO SYLLABLES.

36:34.992 --> 36:37.261
LUCY.

36:43.033 --> 36:44.166
LUCY.

36:44.201 --> 36:46.186
IT TOTALLY SAID, "LUCY."

36:46.221 --> 36:48.171
LUCY AND I'M
A LITTLE GIRL.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.808
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT MATCHES TO THAT.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.377
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.779
I KNOW.

36:58.715 --> 37:02.953
IT'S SO MUCH.

37:02.988 --> 37:06.323
IT'S SO MUCH!

37:06.358 --> 37:08.290
I KNOW.

37:08.325 --> 37:10.294
IT'S JUST BLOWING MY MIND.

37:19.304 --> 37:20.235
HEY.

37:20.270 --> 37:22.471
WE GOT A LOT
OF INFORMATION.

37:22.506 --> 37:24.040
WE DEFINITELY KNOW
WHO'S IN THE HOUSE.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.176
WE SHOULD LET HER KNOW
WHO WE THINK IS HERE.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.778
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
WE HAVE ADAM.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.279
FOR SURE.

37:32.649 --> 37:33.916
IT'S SAYING, "ADAM."

37:33.951 --> 37:36.420
AND WE KNOW THAT A LOT
OF THE OTHER ACTIVITY

37:36.455 --> 37:38.122
IS THE LITTLE GIRL'S SPIRIT,
LUCINDA.

37:38.157 --> 37:39.321
YEAH.

37:39.356 --> 37:40.756
WE GOT HER NAME.

37:40.791 --> 37:43.961
AND SHE MATCHES THE CHILD
FIGURE SEEN BY THE BED.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.361
STANDING NEXT TO THE BED,

37:45.362 --> 37:48.081
JUST A SMALL FIGURE
WATCHING ME SLEEP.

37:48.116 --> 37:50.766
SHE DIED RIGHT OUTSIDE
THIS PROPERTY,

37:50.801 --> 37:54.203
WHICH IS WHY SHE WOULD
WATCH US FROM THE WOODS.

37:54.204 --> 37:56.656
DO YOU WATCH
FROM THE WOODS?

37:56.691 --> 37:59.074
THERE'S THE EERIE CONNECTION

37:59.109 --> 38:01.345
BETWEEN THE TOY SAW
MOVING ON ITS OWN

38:01.380 --> 38:03.346
AND HOW SHE DIED.

38:03.347 --> 38:05.716
AND THE SCRATCHES
AND THE OBJECTS BREAKING,

38:05.751 --> 38:07.415
LIKE THE LIGHT,
ISN'T NEGATIVE.

38:07.450 --> 38:10.620
I MEAN, IT'S JUST HER WAY
OF GETTING OUR ATTENTION.

38:10.655 --> 38:12.656
SO...
- I MEAN, THAT'S...

38:12.691 --> 38:13.889
LUCY'S THERE.

38:13.924 --> 38:16.026
YES. HER SON IS HERE.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.460
YEAH.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.961
I THINK THAT...
I THINK --

38:19.996 --> 38:22.299
I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S AS GOOD
OF NEWS AS WE COULD GIVE HER.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.667
RIGHT. AND THE --
AND THE HISTORY

38:23.702 --> 38:25.219
IS A LITTLE CLEARER NOW.

38:25.254 --> 38:26.702
YEAH. SHE HAS MORE HISTORY.

38:26.737 --> 38:28.570
NOW, SINCE SHE HAS
A LITTLE MORE BACKSTORY,

38:28.605 --> 38:31.224
MAYBE SHE CAN OPEN UP HER HOME
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

38:31.259 --> 38:33.844
MAYBE IT'LL MAKE THINGS
PEACEFUL AROUND HERE.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.513
I AGREE. ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO FIND HER.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.981
- OKAY.
- LET'S GO GET HER.

38:45.555 --> 38:47.790
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
JUST WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT.

38:47.791 --> 38:49.159
YES.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.493
UM, I MEAN,

38:50.528 --> 38:54.165
WE CAME INTO THIS KIND OF
THINKING IT'S YOUR FAMILY.

38:56.666 --> 38:59.118
BUT THERE WAS SOME
ACTIVITY THAT SOUNDED

38:59.153 --> 39:01.571
LIKE IT COULD BE SOMETHING
OR SOMEONE ELSE.

39:01.572 --> 39:04.441
I CAME ACROSS SOMETHING
THAT I FOUND VERY UNUSUAL.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.442
AND THE ASHCRAFTS
HAD A DAUGHTER.

39:06.443 --> 39:10.130
HER NAME WAS LUCINDA.
AND THEY OWNED A SAWMILL.

39:10.165 --> 39:13.817
THE MOTHER BROUGHT THE DAUGHTER
TO SEE THE FATHER

39:13.852 --> 39:15.618
AND GRANDFATHER AT WORK.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.687
SHE LET THE DAUGHTER
RUN UP TO THE MILL.

39:17.722 --> 39:19.522
AND SHE...

39:19.523 --> 39:20.824
SHE RAN INTO THE SAW.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.293
THAT POOR GIRL.

39:22.328 --> 39:23.692
AND THEY DID NOT KNOW.

39:23.727 --> 39:26.379
AND THAT COULD EXPLAIN
THE TOY YOU SAW MOVING.

39:26.414 --> 39:29.032
AND HOW OLD
WAS SHE AT THAT TIME?

39:29.067 --> 39:30.365
- 3 YEARS, 8 MONTHS.
- 3?

39:30.400 --> 39:33.003
SHE WAS EXACTLY THE AGE
THAT MY DAUGHTER IS NOW.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.270
- MY GOSH.
- YEAH.

39:34.305 --> 39:37.140
SO WE STARTED TO TRY
TO MAKE CONTACT

39:37.141 --> 39:38.507
WITH THE LITTLE GIRL.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.144
LISTEN.
"ARE YOU A LITTLE GIRL?"

39:41.179 --> 39:43.747
<i> ARE YOU A LITTLE GIRL?</i>

39:43.782 --> 39:44.713
<i> YES.</i>

39:44.748 --> 39:46.917
<i> -ARE YOU LUCY?</i>
- YES.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.051
- AWW.
- AWW.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.221
WE ASK, "WHAT IS YOUR NAME?"

39:51.256 --> 39:53.390
<i> WHAT IS YOUR NAME?</i>

39:53.425 --> 39:55.926
<i> LUCY.</i>

39:55.961 --> 39:58.393
WHAT'D YOU HEAR?

39:58.428 --> 40:00.897
- I HEARD, "LUCY."
- I HEAR, "LUCY, TOO.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.431
YEAH. I THINK SO.

40:02.466 --> 40:06.069
SO WE THINK LUCINDA IS
THE FIGURE THAT YOU'RE SEEING.

40:06.104 --> 40:09.139
AND IN MY EXPERIENCE,
ESPECIALLY CHILD SPIRITS,

40:09.174 --> 40:11.625
THEY ARE ATTRACTED
TO LOVING HOMES.

40:11.660 --> 40:14.554
AND I THINK THAT
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY

40:14.589 --> 40:17.413
SHE'S ATTRACTED TO THIS SPACE.

40:17.448 --> 40:19.716
AND TO TALK ABOUT
YOUR SCRATCHES FOR A SECOND,

40:19.717 --> 40:21.583
I MEAN, IT HAPPENED ONCE.

40:21.618 --> 40:24.085
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
LOOK TOO MUCH INTO IT.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.323
WHEN WE ENCOUNTER PEOPLE
THAT HAVE SCRATCHES AND STUFF,

40:26.358 --> 40:27.592
SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS
EVERY DAY,

40:27.627 --> 40:29.711
SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS
ONCE A WEEK.

40:29.746 --> 40:31.760
IF THIS HAPPENED ONCE
AT ONE TIME...

40:31.795 --> 40:34.765
SOMETIMES, ENTITIES ARE JUST
SO DESPERATE TO GET IN CONTACT,

40:34.800 --> 40:36.165
THEY WILL ACCIDENTALLY
SCRATCH YOU.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.968
AND KNOWING THAT, LIKE,
IT'S A LITTLE 3-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

40:38.969 --> 40:41.304
LIKE,
THAT'S NOT REALLY SCARY.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.656
THAT'S JUST SAD.

40:42.691 --> 40:43.938
- RIGHT.
- RIGHT.

40:43.973 --> 40:45.407
BUT IT WAS JUST SO CLEAR.

40:45.442 --> 40:48.812
AND IT JUST, EVEN NOW,
JUST BREAKS MY HEART.

40:48.847 --> 40:51.647
IT'S -- YEAH.

40:51.648 --> 40:53.750
YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT,
YOU INVESTIGATED WITH US.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.852
WE WERE HAVING TROUBLE --
WE WERE REALLY TRYING

40:55.853 --> 40:57.054
TO REACH OUT TO
THE FAMILY MEMBERS.

40:57.089 --> 40:59.121
- RIGHT.
- AND WE WERE NERVOUS

40:59.156 --> 41:00.490
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T
GETTING ANYTHING.

41:00.525 --> 41:01.790
SO THAT'S WHY
WE BROUGHT YOU IN.

41:01.825 --> 41:04.995
AND SO WE'LL PLAY
THE EVPs WE GOT LAST NIGHT.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.864
HERE, GO LISTEN.
I HEARD SOME OF 'EM.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.699
- SO I'LL LET YOU LISTEN TO IT.
- OKAY.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.800
UM...

41:11.835 --> 41:13.670
<i> WHY ARE YOU HERE?</i>

41:13.705 --> 41:14.870
<i> ADAM.</i>

41:14.905 --> 41:15.906
WAS IT SAYING ADAM?

41:15.941 --> 41:16.872
- ADAM.
- YEAH.

41:16.907 --> 41:18.507
- WE THINK IT'S ADAM.
- WOW.

41:18.542 --> 41:20.810
I THINK ADAM REALLY WANTED YOU
TO KNOW HE WAS HERE.

41:20.845 --> 41:26.349
- YEAH.
- YEAH. I THINK SO.

41:26.384 --> 41:28.118
I'M SORRY.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.818
- IT'S OKAY.
- IT'S FINE.

41:29.853 --> 41:32.222
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
HE WAS HERE.

41:32.257 --> 41:34.591
BUT JUST TO HEAR IT
AND...

41:34.626 --> 41:35.557
I KNOW.

41:38.262 --> 41:40.865
THAT'S WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO.

41:44.734 --> 41:46.001
WE ARE SO HAPPY

41:46.036 --> 41:47.670
AND THRILLED TO BE ABLE
TO DO THIS FOR YOU.

41:47.705 --> 41:49.838
- FOR SURE.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

41:49.873 --> 41:53.577
NOW THAT CATHERINE KNOWS
THAT LUCINDA IS IN HER HOME,

41:53.612 --> 41:57.515
SHE WOULD LIKE TO OPEN HER HOME
TO THIS LITTLE GIRL.

41:57.550 --> 42:01.418
LUCINDA, IF YOU'RE HERE,
IF THAT'S YOU IN THE ROOM,

42:01.453 --> 42:03.552
IN THE HOUSE,

42:03.587 --> 42:06.556
YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO COME OUT
INTO THE REST OF THE HOUSE

42:06.591 --> 42:08.459
AND JOIN US
IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY,

42:08.494 --> 42:10.192
MAKES YOU COMFORTABLE.

42:10.227 --> 42:15.132
AND IF YOU SEE MY SON OUT THERE,
FEEL FREE TO INTERACT WITH HIM.

42:15.167 --> 42:18.099
SO...

42:18.134 --> 42:21.404
I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE WERE
ABLE TO GIVE CATHERINE

42:21.439 --> 42:24.874
CONFIRMATION THAT HER SON
IS WITH HER.

42:24.909 --> 42:27.611
EVEN THOUGH THE CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING LUCINDA'S DEATH

42:27.646 --> 42:29.846
ARE HORRIBLE, THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL

42:29.881 --> 42:31.279
IS THE ONE CAUSING THE ACTIVITY

42:31.314 --> 42:34.051
WILL HOPEFULLY BRING COMFORT
TO CATHERINE AND MARY.
