[Episode 8]

00:32.280 --> 00:34.550
Ah, I'm leaving.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.920
Ooh, date?

00:38.320 --> 00:41.650
-Of course it is. Goodbye.
-Okay.

00:45.290 --> 00:47.660
Oh, darn it.

00:49.290 --> 00:51.760
It's the abdominal artery rupture patient we just told you over the phone.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.500
We don't have a doctor who can do the operation. Didn't I just tell you that?

00:54.500 --> 00:56.800
What are we gonna do about him?

00:56.800 --> 00:59.940
He's in the state of hypovolemic shock. Now we can hardly maintain his vital signs.

00:59.940 --> 01:01.570
He'll die if you don't do the operation now.

01:01.570 --> 01:03.310
We can't.

01:03.310 --> 01:05.310
Please leave.

01:05.310 --> 01:07.510
I've thought it for hundreds of times.

01:07.510 --> 01:10.980
If I had made another choice that day,

01:13.250 --> 01:15.650
would I still have lost that person?

01:17.590 --> 01:21.530
If I hadn't grabbed it,

01:23.300 --> 01:26.160
would I be a different doctor?

01:26.160 --> 01:28.130
Stop!

01:30.770 --> 01:32.240
Isn't this a hospital?

01:32.240 --> 01:33.640
Aren't we doctors?

01:33.640 --> 01:35.370
If doctors abandon patients, then who will…

01:35.370 --> 01:37.710
You fool, think you are a doctor now.

01:37.710 --> 01:41.150
Hey, why don't you do the surgery on him then?

01:41.150 --> 01:44.350
If I had let it go then,

01:44.350 --> 01:48.350
would I have a more comfortable life?

01:48.350 --> 01:52.190
Dad.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.570
Will I be the same?

02:00.570 --> 02:02.830
Will my whole life get changed

02:02.830 --> 02:05.370
because of this choice?

02:05.370 --> 02:07.470
But what to do?

02:07.470 --> 02:09.340
I can't let go.

02:09.340 --> 02:12.140
I just can't.

02:12.140 --> 02:14.650
Me, either.

02:16.850 --> 02:18.950
I just couldn't.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.260
I still remember that part till today.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.390
Please call Professor Min.

02:27.430 --> 02:28.990
I'll try to keep him alive before he comes.

02:28.990 --> 02:30.760
This way, please.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.760
Hurry up.

02:35.770 --> 02:38.570
Hey, Go Seung Tak, what are you doing?

02:38.570 --> 02:39.910
Well,

02:39.910 --> 02:43.070
should we drive a dying patient out?

02:43.070 --> 02:44.380
This can't happen in my hospital.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.510
This patient has a large abdominal aneurysm.

02:46.510 --> 02:49.210
Go Seung Tak, what can you do?

02:49.210 --> 02:51.220
What should I do?

02:55.190 --> 02:57.690
Severe bleeding.

02:57.690 --> 03:00.590
If it goes on like this, he'll die before Professor Min comes.

03:00.590 --> 03:03.560
But… I don't remember what happened next.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.430
I've totally forgotten as if I had blacked out.

03:06.430 --> 03:08.370
Start the operation now.

03:08.370 --> 03:10.240
Scissors.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.900
We're the same on this.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.670
I'm also a nut in the operating room.

03:14.670 --> 03:17.510
What's the matter? Isn't it Chief Ban's operation?

03:17.510 --> 03:20.310
It got his name on it.

03:20.310 --> 03:22.780
I think he'll come.

03:22.780 --> 03:25.850
Bro, I'm counting on you.

03:25.850 --> 03:27.120
Be prepared.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.450
Um… Yeah…

03:29.450 --> 03:32.520
Let's keep him alive for Chief Ban.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.590
I don't remember at all.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.230
Like I fell asleep from that moment.

03:37.230 --> 03:39.260
Hey, are you crazy?

03:39.260 --> 03:41.829
Stay away from the patient!

03:42.900 --> 03:45.500
50% patients with abdominal aortic rupture die.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.140
The rate increases 1% per hour.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.440
He may have had intestinal necrosis now.

03:50.440 --> 03:54.110
There's no time left to delay. Or he must die.

03:54.410 --> 03:56.110
Suction.

04:01.790 --> 04:03.520
Suction.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.630
Gim Jae Won, suction.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.630
OK, suction.

04:11.630 --> 04:12.630
This is Operating Room 8.

04:12.630 --> 04:14.370
Get any doctor here.

04:14.370 --> 04:15.130
Suction.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.100
We're short of hands here.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.269
They are all interns.

04:18.269 --> 04:20.570
Even Dr. Bak will do.

04:20.870 --> 04:22.270
Scissors.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.310
Retractor.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.780

04:31.780 --> 04:33.790
Get deeper.

04:35.990 --> 04:36.920
Suction.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.920
Vascular clamp.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.170
It's under control now.

04:47.170 --> 04:49.170
Blood pressure is rising.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.370
What are you doing now!

04:56.370 --> 04:59.409
Put on your gown and come to help.

05:12.490 --> 05:14.190
Hold tight.

05:14.190 --> 05:15.830
Wake up and focus!

05:15.830 --> 05:17.730
Don't you see the blood pressure is dropping?

05:17.730 --> 05:19.230
Wait.

05:19.230 --> 05:20.630
Be careful not to touch the vascular clamp.

05:20.630 --> 05:23.200
Oh, right. Careful.

05:36.150 --> 05:38.350
Be careful with the vascular clamp.

05:38.350 --> 05:39.920
Don't touch it.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.810
It seems to be under control.

06:07.810 --> 06:09.550
He survived.

06:09.550 --> 06:12.020
The patient survived.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.920
The patient survived.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.020
You lunatic!

06:22.690 --> 06:24.830
When I woke up suddenly

06:24.830 --> 06:26.630
and looked at myself,

06:26.630 --> 06:29.900
I really felt like a madman.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.550
Professor Min.

06:41.550 --> 06:43.580
What? What's going on?

06:43.580 --> 06:47.350
This intern saved the patient.

06:52.690 --> 06:58.430
But I was afraid back then.

06:58.430 --> 07:01.130
Weren't you?

07:06.600 --> 07:09.140
Wow, have I done it so well?

07:09.140 --> 07:12.480
Oh, why am I always so great?

07:12.940 --> 07:15.080
Lunatic!

07:15.080 --> 07:19.320
I just felt a special feeling.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.650
That's why I wanted to be a doctor.

07:22.650 --> 07:26.420
The patient survived, didn't him?

07:27.890 --> 07:30.090
When Seung Tak was 18,

07:30.090 --> 07:33.030
I thought it was just temporary.

07:33.030 --> 07:36.130
But it seems that he has always been like that.

07:36.130 --> 07:38.770
Or, has he suffered a relapse?

07:38.770 --> 07:42.970
What are you saying?

07:42.970 --> 07:46.950
You know what I'm saying.

07:50.780 --> 07:52.520
It's me.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.890
I can see you, Miss.

08:01.490 --> 08:04.830
I thought it was the aftereffects of the accident.

08:04.830 --> 08:07.800
Besides, since he came to the hospital,

08:07.800 --> 08:09.800
he has acted weird sometimes.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.270
I'm not the only one who has noticed.

08:26.380 --> 08:30.960
So I asked my friends who once studied in America about it.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.390
Unexpectedly,

08:32.390 --> 08:34.289
I heard something interesting.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.090
I thought when in America,

08:36.090 --> 08:38.659
he would skip classes and have fun outside all day.

08:38.659 --> 08:40.630
But it turned out that he frequented hospitals.

08:40.630 --> 08:43.299
And he visited only Neurosurgery and Psychiatry  departments.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.840
It seems that Seung Tak has taken a lot of efforts

08:47.840 --> 08:50.680
to get himself treated.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.640
So you are still not aware of it.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.250
That means his grandpa also doesn't know it.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.050
Han Seung Won.

09:00.890 --> 09:03.620
My poor little brother.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.260
He has struggled so hard

09:08.260 --> 09:10.860
to impress his grandpa.

09:11.430 --> 09:15.930
But the hospital is the place of life and death.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.770
And even more coincidentally,

09:21.970 --> 09:23.610
he is a doctor.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.610
[Lee Seon Ho]

10:02.080 --> 10:03.250
What's up?

10:03.250 --> 10:04.980
What operation did Go Seung Tak do?

10:04.980 --> 10:08.150
An ER patient with abdominal aneurysms.

10:08.150 --> 10:11.420
All professors were out. The patient was supposed to be transferred to another hospital.

10:11.420 --> 10:14.190
But Go Seung Tak stopped it

10:14.190 --> 10:16.130
and arranged an operation in Chief Ban's name.

10:16.130 --> 10:17.360
He ordered Gim Jae Won to arrange it.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.260
He also wrote the record yesterday.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.170
Shortly after Lee Ji Woo's surgery,

10:23.170 --> 10:24.500
the same thing happened again…

10:24.500 --> 10:26.340
And these surgeries are not ordinary ones.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.310
It's not just once or twice.

10:28.310 --> 10:30.340
There must be something wrong with him.

10:37.820 --> 10:38.920
Are you okay?

10:42.090 --> 10:44.160
I'm good.

10:46.390 --> 10:47.960
Where's Go Seung Tak?

10:47.960 --> 10:49.860
Where is he now?

10:52.460 --> 10:53.700
That is to say,

10:54.670 --> 10:58.600
I'm not the only one who has experienced this.

10:59.870 --> 11:02.640
The once victim became the victimizer.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.710
Are you passing it down from generation to generation?

11:06.710 --> 11:08.580
What's that expression?

11:08.580 --> 11:11.750
Right, will a person who can see ghosts

11:11.750 --> 11:13.950
be surprised and scared by my story?

11:14.890 --> 11:16.150
Aren't you curious

11:16.150 --> 11:19.520
how I became a genius doctor from an intern?

11:19.520 --> 11:20.730
So what if I knew?

11:20.730 --> 11:22.530
I won't follow suit.

11:22.530 --> 11:24.030
But I do want to know

11:24.030 --> 11:26.300
how you became an ill-tempered doctor

11:26.300 --> 11:28.030
from an intern.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.200
Do you know

11:32.200 --> 11:33.740
who that ghost was?

11:33.740 --> 11:34.840
I don't know.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.770
Because I couldn't see him.

11:36.770 --> 11:40.110
It must be an excellent doctor.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.310
Just like me.

11:42.050 --> 11:43.750
Good for you.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.880
Luckily it wasn't the Jade Emperor or a Buddha.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.450
I was indeed lucky.

11:47.450 --> 11:49.920
I would have been screwed if it had been a doctor like you

11:49.920 --> 11:51.360
who knows a lot but can't perform.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.390
Did it just happen to you that one night?

11:55.390 --> 11:56.990
Or…

11:56.990 --> 11:58.760
It also occurred several times when I was a resident.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.270
When there were no doctors to operate

12:01.270 --> 12:03.570
and the patients were going to be driven away.

12:04.270 --> 12:05.540
Just like what happened today.

12:05.670 --> 12:07.340
[EMC VIP ICU]

12:09.440 --> 12:11.880
Ji Woo is also one of them.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.510
Her parents failed to notice her symptoms

12:13.510 --> 12:15.350
so that it was too late to operate.

12:15.350 --> 12:18.620
They carried their unconscious daughter to the hospital in the middle of the night.

12:22.390 --> 12:24.260
Hello.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.420
Open your hands.

12:27.060 --> 12:28.930
This is a magic candy.

12:28.930 --> 12:31.800
Hold it tightly in your hand and it won't hurt.

12:33.300 --> 12:36.770
At that time, I promised her

12:37.640 --> 12:40.670
that if she came back in ten years

12:41.240 --> 12:45.180
I would operate on her with my own strength.

12:45.180 --> 12:49.250
I didn't expect that she heard it.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.680
A decent man must keep his promise.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.920
You were being irresponsible.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.650
I almost broke my promise

12:54.650 --> 12:55.550
because of you.

12:55.550 --> 12:57.590
It was not my fault

12:57.590 --> 13:00.260
you had that accident before the surgery.

13:00.260 --> 13:00.760
What?

13:00.760 --> 13:01.990
As you just said,

13:01.990 --> 13:04.230
as a person who can see ghosts,

13:04.230 --> 13:06.060
I'm not surprised or scared.

13:06.060 --> 13:06.930
So…?

13:06.930 --> 13:08.500
Now that you possessed my body,

13:08.500 --> 13:10.030
you should keep your promise.

13:10.030 --> 13:12.200
You borrowed my hands by force,

13:12.200 --> 13:14.270
so you must save her no matter what.

13:14.270 --> 13:16.940
Why are you trying to let go halfway?

13:16.940 --> 13:19.210
What should I do then?

13:19.210 --> 13:21.110
You... So you…

13:21.110 --> 13:23.920
You should be grateful that you didn't die that day.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.550
But didn't you tell me that you would die

13:28.220 --> 13:29.790
if you possessed me too frequently?

13:31.090 --> 13:33.490
Even though I'm not a lifesaving doctor,

13:34.430 --> 13:36.590
I can't kill people, right?

13:36.590 --> 13:40.360
So let's stay away from each other in the future.

13:41.370 --> 13:43.270
Keep a two-meter distance

13:43.270 --> 13:44.900
between man and ghost.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.010
Don't you remember

13:49.610 --> 13:52.010
that it was you who grabbed that patient

13:55.510 --> 13:58.550
and asked me to possess you to save him.

13:58.550 --> 14:03.020
It was you who saved him.

14:06.790 --> 14:08.490
Great.

14:09.530 --> 14:11.560
It was you who grabbed that patient.

14:12.460 --> 14:16.230
It was you who saved him.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.170
I was like you back then.

14:18.170 --> 14:21.210
I also wanted to escape at first

14:21.210 --> 14:24.310
because I got so scared and worried.

14:24.910 --> 14:26.210
But do you know

14:27.210 --> 14:29.650
why I didn't leave but stayed instead?

14:45.730 --> 14:48.530
As you said, because the patient survived.

14:48.530 --> 14:50.640
Though it wasn't my own strength,

14:51.440 --> 14:54.940
it was my hands that saved the patient.

14:54.940 --> 14:56.810
I did my part.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.480
In my operating room,

15:02.110 --> 15:04.180
you must felt the same

15:05.350 --> 15:07.220
when you held the scalpel.

15:09.350 --> 15:11.490
Luckily, I grabbed your hands.

15:12.220 --> 15:16.060
Also because of that, I'm still here and alive.

15:16.690 --> 15:20.030
You are right.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.000
I may never wake up if I keep doing this.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.170
But even if I had  known, I would have made the same choice.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.040
I'm a doctor after all.

15:31.910 --> 15:34.010
You bought me some time.

15:35.480 --> 15:39.150
But it is running out.

15:40.280 --> 15:43.390
I'd rather do something meaningful

15:45.020 --> 15:47.730
than do nothing and wait to die.

15:47.730 --> 15:50.030
That's why I need your help.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.270
If you don't want me to do it,

15:57.340 --> 15:58.840
then I won't possess you.

16:01.310 --> 16:03.040
After all, you are the Party A.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.090
Su Jeong, don't keep popping up.

16:22.090 --> 16:23.560
I heard the surgery went well.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.360
Why slap me

16:25.360 --> 16:26.060
when you ought to reward me

16:26.060 --> 16:27.830
for such good news?

16:27.830 --> 16:30.940
OK. Come on, I'll give you a reward.

16:30.940 --> 16:32.670
Really?

16:32.670 --> 16:34.470
What kind of reward?

16:34.470 --> 16:35.810
Something to eat?

16:35.810 --> 16:37.240
Expensive one?

16:41.010 --> 16:42.650
What are you doing?

16:42.650 --> 16:44.520
I'm giving you a reward.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.220
I'm giving you this to make you a strong thoracic surgeon.

16:47.950 --> 16:49.820
What are you waiting for? Di it with me.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.260
Oh! Why deep squat?

16:53.260 --> 16:56.260
Do thoracic surgeons operate with their legs?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.230
You've been so low lately.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.100
It's like you are having some after-effects from puberty.

17:01.870 --> 17:05.040
What's the matter with you?

17:05.040 --> 17:06.740
Nothing.

17:06.740 --> 17:09.310
Maybe just some confusion about self-identity cognition.

17:10.270 --> 17:13.910
If there's something wrong with you identity,

17:13.910 --> 17:16.010
that's a big deal.

17:16.010 --> 17:17.310
What's bothering you?

17:20.920 --> 17:23.950
What about you? Do you have to work in Thoracic Surgery Department?

17:23.950 --> 17:25.220
Do you have to convince your mom?

17:25.220 --> 17:26.760
That's right.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.560
I want to be a doctor like you.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.530
What?

17:33.930 --> 17:36.430
You just saved that patient's life.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.370
Do you know how many patients you've saved recently?

17:44.340 --> 17:46.640
Don't you want to save a patient's life with your own hands

17:47.410 --> 17:49.980
instead of someone else's hands one day?

17:51.950 --> 17:54.120
What do you mean?

17:56.550 --> 17:59.260
I want to be like that someday.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.560
So, I'm gonna work hard and dedicate my life in it.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.560
Oh, my legs.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.030
You don't have to dedicate your life, do you?

18:04.030 --> 18:06.530
Would you risk your life to save someone else's?

18:06.530 --> 18:08.130
You're just a doctor.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.230
You might even die working so hard.

18:11.540 --> 18:14.640
Do you have several lives?

18:14.640 --> 18:16.970
Why would you do that?

18:30.120 --> 18:32.860
You're too tired. Go home and have a rest.

18:43.170 --> 18:47.570
If you keep doing this, you will die.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.140
Thank you.

18:52.980 --> 18:55.080
Thank you so much.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.850
Is he in there?

19:02.650 --> 19:06.190
I'm sorry, Brother.

19:16.070 --> 19:17.900
Brother.

19:20.770 --> 19:22.210
He woke up.

19:26.180 --> 19:30.380
I knew you could do it.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.540
You've had a long day.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.080
You need to protect your son.

20:32.680 --> 20:35.680
After all, he is very important to you.

20:43.890 --> 20:46.760
Seung Tak had two surgeries.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.790
Two very difficult ones.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.630
Very difficult surgeries?

[EunSang University Medical Center]

21:10.710 --> 21:13.920
Is there something wrong with my husband?

21:13.920 --> 21:15.020
What?

21:15.020 --> 21:16.390
There's no problem.

21:16.390 --> 21:18.920
His operation went well.

21:18.920 --> 21:23.390
I never got a chance to thank the doctor.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.960
Which doctor did the operation on my husband?

21:30.370 --> 21:31.470
It's me.

21:31.470 --> 21:34.610
I'm Chief Ban Tae Sik, the chief surgeon for his operation.

21:34.610 --> 21:37.070
Yes, that's right.

21:37.070 --> 21:40.040
I don't know how to Thank you, Chief Ban.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.410
Thank you very much indeed.

21:42.410 --> 21:46.150
You're welcome. I just did what I was supposed to do.

21:46.150 --> 21:48.950
The operation was difficult.

21:48.950 --> 21:50.250
It's more difficult now.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.220
Why hasn't he come yet?

22:07.100 --> 22:08.210
You are late.

22:12.110 --> 22:13.410
What are you doing here?

22:13.410 --> 22:14.810
I came to greet you.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.710
Are you all right?

22:16.710 --> 22:19.250
You're not worried about me right now, are you?

22:19.250 --> 22:22.450
You were weak yesterday, but you had two surgeries.

22:22.450 --> 22:24.460
Why don't you do some deep squats?

22:28.890 --> 22:30.230
What are you doing?

22:30.790 --> 22:33.500
I'm trying to please you. Because I am the Party B.

22:35.330 --> 22:37.070
Let's get back to normal.

22:37.070 --> 22:39.600
But still, remember you are Party B.

22:40.370 --> 22:42.240
You brat! What time is it?

22:42.240 --> 22:44.310
You are so lax. Come with me.

Hello. Welcome back to the real world.

23:17.670 --> 23:19.110
You know who I am, don't you?

Who are you?

23:23.010 --> 23:24.720
Take a closer look.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.390
Look at my face. You're happy to see me again, aren't you?

23:30.050 --> 23:31.920
It's the first time I've seen you.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.090
He is lying.

23:33.090 --> 23:33.960
What?

23:33.960 --> 23:36.330
How can you refuse to admit now?

23:36.330 --> 23:39.700
A Cheong, maybe…

23:39.700 --> 23:42.770
Don't worry about the hospital fees.

23:42.770 --> 23:44.130
It has been paid.

23:44.130 --> 23:46.540
Who paid for it?

23:51.310 --> 23:53.110
Don't worry about hospital fees.

23:53.110 --> 23:56.080
Everything related to the accident was agreed to with the police.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.650
Just focus on your recovery.

24:00.620 --> 24:04.390
You are young after all. You will stand up again soon.

24:09.730 --> 24:11.330
Right.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.730
What did he say?

24:13.730 --> 24:15.500
He'll give you money if you keep your mouth shut?

You know that.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.960
Hi, Go Seung Tak, what's the matter so early in the morning?

24:43.630 --> 24:45.400
What's wrong?

24:45.400 --> 24:48.670
Nothing. I just have something to tell you.

24:48.670 --> 24:50.300
Don't cross the line again.

24:50.300 --> 24:53.470
What are you talking about?

24:53.470 --> 24:54.810
It's you who shouldn't cross the line.

24:54.810 --> 24:56.970
You've been giving me a hard time lately.

24:56.970 --> 24:59.710
Yeah, because people keep trying to stop me.

24:59.710 --> 25:01.450
That's why I've been trying so hard not to cross the line.

25:01.450 --> 25:03.350
I'm experiencing identity confusion.

25:03.350 --> 25:04.680
It's not puberty.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.150
So, don't involve yourself in it.

25:07.150 --> 25:09.790
It's not good for you.

25:09.790 --> 25:13.090
-I'm warning you…
-I just warned you.

25:13.090 --> 25:15.590
Just keep it in your mind.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.500
Oh, Go Seung Tak.

25:38.780 --> 25:39.920
Both of you were brought here

25:39.920 --> 25:41.750
after the accident

25:41.750 --> 25:44.090
and had surgery at the same time.

25:44.090 --> 25:45.890
But one of you...

25:45.890 --> 25:48.790
As you can see, he's in this state.

25:49.290 --> 25:51.860
Will he wake up?

25:51.860 --> 25:54.700
With God's help.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.840
You still need a rest.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.510
I shouldn't have asked you that.

26:03.510 --> 26:04.940
But is there anything

26:04.940 --> 26:07.780
you want to tell us about the accident?

26:07.780 --> 26:09.710
No…

26:09.710 --> 26:11.350
Nothing.

26:11.980 --> 26:14.380
Because I don't know why I had an accident.

26:14.380 --> 26:16.190
Oh.

26:26.030 --> 26:30.330
You're a disappointment.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.180
Brother, I'm going to buy something to drink.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.480
Just wait here for a moment.

26:52.520 --> 26:55.360
He didn't lie. He just doesn't remember.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.560
Have you ever met anyone who remembers their past lives?

26:57.560 --> 26:59.200
No?

26:59.200 --> 27:02.970
It's the same thing.

27:03.470 --> 27:06.370
Well, of course he can't remember.

27:06.370 --> 27:07.770
Could he have lived to remember that

27:07.770 --> 27:10.070
he was a ghost in a previous life

27:10.070 --> 27:11.940
and wandered around?

27:11.940 --> 27:14.340
He's not gonna make it.

27:14.340 --> 27:17.710
Is it also an act of God?

27:25.690 --> 27:28.690
The world goes on as it should

27:28.690 --> 27:32.930
when ghosts and the living have no memory.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.530
Do you have any memories you can't lose?

27:37.530 --> 27:38.700
What?

27:38.700 --> 27:41.000
No, it's not for that reason.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.270
Well, I probably don't have to worry about what you're doing.

27:44.270 --> 27:48.550
Either you won't wake up or you'll die.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.450
I'm gonna go.

28:06.830 --> 28:09.670
If he doesn't remember, just tell him.

28:09.670 --> 28:11.500
That's not difficult.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.550
You took the pills that day because you were feeling sick, right?

28:30.550 --> 28:32.690
And you were sleepy.

28:32.690 --> 28:33.820
What?

28:34.360 --> 28:36.530
You didn't mean for an accident.

28:36.530 --> 28:40.600
You were just trying to buy time with a simple crash.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.630
You woke up and found out what had happened.

28:43.630 --> 28:46.340

28:52.380 --> 28:55.480

I don't mean to, but I know you.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.120
Why don't you just live your life the way it is?

29:00.120 --> 29:03.950
Otherwise, you'll be miserable.

29:17.830 --> 29:20.900
You're not being obedient.

29:20.900 --> 29:23.670
Don't do it

29:23.670 --> 29:26.610
and don't drink when you're told not to.

29:26.610 --> 29:30.050
You're shortening your own life.

29:30.910 --> 29:34.320
I told you not to throw out the trash.

29:34.820 --> 29:36.420
Don't move.

29:38.420 --> 29:41.160
Take your hands off when I say something nice.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.760
I told you not to take it.

29:48.400 --> 29:52.500
Really. Ghosts are the same as human beings.

29:53.270 --> 29:56.710
But sometimes soju is better than medicine.

Come on.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.550
What a pity. We should drink beer.

She has suffered a lot since she went to America.

32:38.070 --> 32:42.270
She refused all my support and persevered alone.

32:43.470 --> 32:46.280
She said that

32:46.280 --> 32:48.210
when I went to see her.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.350
She said she left the most precious people in her life.

32:52.350 --> 32:53.820
She didn't deserve a good life

32:53.820 --> 32:56.090
when she came to America.

32:56.090 --> 33:00.160
She would punish herself for the rest of her life.

33:00.790 --> 33:05.160
I knew when you and Se Jin ran into each other in my ward.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.160
This is my daughter.

33:07.160 --> 33:11.840
He is that man.

33:11.840 --> 33:16.640
I'm really disappointed.

Drink it.

33:28.520 --> 33:32.120
You are so narrow-minded.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.860
Because of you, she didn't say what was on her mind.

33:34.860 --> 33:36.860
I guess she just left like that.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.130
Her mother died suddenly.

33:43.130 --> 33:46.570
Someone said she was an illegitimate child for no reason.

33:46.570 --> 33:48.470
And her half-brother

33:48.470 --> 33:53.040
treated her like a pest from the first moment he met her.

There's nothing I can do for you.

34:16.030 --> 34:18.030
and it is now.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.270
Sorry.

34:22.270 --> 34:25.480
Sorry, Yeong Min.

34:34.449 --> 34:36.949
Why didn't you

34:36.949 --> 34:41.290
try to pluck up the courage before she left...

Se Jin.

35:17.390 --> 35:20.300
The number you dialed is not being answered.

35:22.370 --> 35:29.340
Why didn't you wait a little longer?

35:41.920 --> 35:44.220
Are you crying?

35:44.220 --> 35:45.960
No, who's crying?

35:45.960 --> 35:47.360
You did cry.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.190
Your eyes look red.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.790
It's only that sand got into my eyes.

35:50.790 --> 35:52.700
What is wrong?

35:52.700 --> 35:54.060
Here is the good news. Good news.

35:54.060 --> 35:57.430
-The motorbike...
-Bad news!

What? What happened to the motorbike?

36:01.200 --> 36:04.470
I have both good news and bad news. What do you want to hear first?

36:04.470 --> 36:07.140
Tell me the bad news first.

36:07.140 --> 36:08.310
The President calls for an end.

36:08.310 --> 36:08.880
What?

36:08.880 --> 36:10.780
What?

36:10.780 --> 36:14.350
Then tell me the good news first.

36:14.350 --> 36:16.390
Time out.

36:22.230 --> 36:23.730
How could it be possible?

36:23.730 --> 36:26.460
Why? Why does the President call for an end?

36:26.460 --> 36:29.000
Because he is a father.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.300
Pour me one cup too.

36:32.300 --> 36:36.110
This is the drink of consolation.

36:36.110 --> 36:36.970
What?

36:36.970 --> 36:38.780
You have seen it, right?

36:38.780 --> 36:43.880
I am a failure as a father in my life.

36:47.620 --> 36:50.320
Why does this alcohol taste so bitter?

36:50.320 --> 36:54.060
Life is bitter, so is alcohol.

36:55.630 --> 36:58.760
He is my only son, so I spoiled him.

36:58.760 --> 37:03.930
However, I never really trusted him.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.900
I am an unsuccessful father.

37:05.900 --> 37:10.140
My son didn't grow up to be a good person as a matter of course.

37:12.140 --> 37:15.710
I know I am cheeky to ask this of you,

37:15.710 --> 37:22.720
but could you take pity on me?

37:22.720 --> 37:25.460
Let me bear the sins

37:27.220 --> 37:31.130
my son committed.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.900
So,

37:37.900 --> 37:39.140
he doesn’t want people to know

37:39.140 --> 37:42.070
the sins of his horrible son, right?

37:42.070 --> 37:42.970
Even if parents are stabbed by their children,

37:42.970 --> 37:45.210
they will help hide the murder weapon.

37:45.210 --> 37:47.240
That is true only when parents are stabbed.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.010
How about you, professor?

37:48.010 --> 37:49.610
What will you do to the person who stabbed you?

37:49.610 --> 37:54.180
Are you as sad and angry as I am?

37:55.520 --> 37:57.520
It was not easy for him to make such a decision.

37:57.520 --> 38:00.160
Because he knows his son better than anyone else,

38:00.160 --> 38:02.630
he wants to stop him from hurting more people

38:02.630 --> 38:05.160
and to protect his daughter.

38:05.160 --> 38:09.500
I'll take care of the rest in due time.

Is it medical malpractice?

You did it, right?

This is the President's last will.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.440
When something bad happens to him,

42:14.440 --> 42:18.080
I will only read his will in the presence of all his immediate family.

but I still don't quite understand.

43:12.070 --> 43:15.670
This is not simple malpractice, but a calculated crime.

43:15.670 --> 43:19.480
Do you have other reasons for doing this?

43:19.480 --> 43:23.980
One reason is that the dead soul can't leave this world peacefully.

43:23.980 --> 43:26.280
For example, he wants to protect someone

43:26.280 --> 43:29.220
or is indignant at what has been done to him.

43:29.220 --> 43:34.790
It's also possible that he can't forget the taste of something.

45:52.230 --> 45:54.630
they should admit their fault honestly and undertake the liability.
