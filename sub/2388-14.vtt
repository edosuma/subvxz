WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:04.046
You guys. You guys will not
believe what just happened.

00:04.046 --> 00:05.547
On my way here, a taxi

00:05.631 --> 00:07.424
jumped the curb
and it pinned this old lady,

00:07.508 --> 00:09.801
and I-I just went into this,
like, crazy adrenaline mode

00:09.885 --> 00:11.261
and I somehow lifted it off her.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.096
Oh, my God, Ted,
your wrist.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.431
Oh, yeah, I guess
it's a little swollen.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.974
- I must've strained it lifting.
- No,

00:16.058 --> 00:17.893
I believe our dear
friend Lily was referring

00:17.893 --> 00:19.186
to your other wrist.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.396
The one wearing the
male birth control.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.523
I was gonna go with

00:22.523 --> 00:23.607
"chastity bracelet."

00:23.607 --> 00:25.984
God, is it possible
to love you more?

00:26.068 --> 00:27.986
Really? Really?
I just saved someone's life,

00:28.070 --> 00:29.530
and you guys are focusing on this?

00:29.530 --> 00:31.031
Yeah, you know what, guys?
Leave him alone.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.157
All right,
he's a hero.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.117
Thank you.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.744
Do you think that your
super strength came from

00:35.744 --> 00:37.538
wearing Wonder Woman's
magic wrist cuff?

00:38.956 --> 00:41.542
Yeah, I'll have you know
that because of this cuff,

00:41.542 --> 00:42.835
I have a date.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.002
With some hand lotion
and the Internet?

00:44.086 --> 00:46.463
It is possible
to love you more!

00:46.547 --> 00:49.132
She exists.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.593
And she's right outside.

00:51.677 --> 00:54.137
- Great. Bring her in.
- You know what? It's so nice out.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.640
Why don't... why don't
we just all go for a walk.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.100
It's pouring rain, Ted.
I think it's pretty obvious

00:58.100 --> 00:59.643
she can't fit
through the door. Mm.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.770
She is a gorgeous,
athletic woman.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.772
"Athletic"?
Sideburns, no cans.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.274
She is hot.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.150
So why can't
she come in, Ted?

01:07.234 --> 01:09.820
She can come in.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.781
In six and a half months.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.241
Wait.
Are you saying she's...

01:14.241 --> 01:15.367
Twenty.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.493
And a half.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.661
Almost.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.513
Ah-ah! Hold up, guys.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.892
She had to bounce. Um,
a flash mob broke out in front

01:39.892 --> 01:42.477
of a line of Korean-Mexican
food trucks in Williamsburg.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.604
The only thing

01:43.604 --> 01:45.314
that would make her
more of a 20-year-old

01:45.314 --> 01:47.733
is an ironic form of transportation.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.026
Yeah.
- She's roller skating there.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.695
I don't know
which is more pathetic...

01:51.695 --> 01:53.655
that you're going out
with a 20-year-old

01:53.739 --> 01:56.533
or that you bought a leather
cuff to get a date with her.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.910
I didn't buy this

01:57.910 --> 01:59.161
to get a date.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.495
I just happened to be out

02:00.579 --> 02:02.414
catching up on
some Saturday afternoon

02:02.414 --> 02:03.749
leather cuff shopping, Oh.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.376
and she just happened to be
a leather cuff saleswoman.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.589
God, I am so glad I am
done chasing bimbos.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.925
Now that I'm engaged,
that whole part of my life

02:12.925 --> 02:14.843
just seems
sad and empty.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.094
I don't want this
to sound

02:16.178 --> 02:18.305
too harsh, Ted,
but you disgust me.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.642
Until a month ago, your
headboard had a lube dispenser.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.976
Uh, yeah.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.395
- We got rid of that, okay?
- Yeah.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.647
Anyway, speaking of engaged,

02:26.647 --> 02:28.899
check out what got back
from being resized.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.277
Oh, my God.
Look at the size of that rock.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.362
Barney, you don't

02:33.362 --> 02:35.656
start with the
I-got-caught-cheating diamond.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.658
You give yourself
room to grow.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.742
It's a family heirloom.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.868
Yeah, I got
a few dirty looks

02:39.952 --> 02:41.495
from Barney's half-sister
over Christmas,

02:41.495 --> 02:44.289
so I had to sit her down
and explain very respectfully...

02:44.373 --> 02:45.541
that she can suck it.

02:45.541 --> 02:46.834
Okay.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.585
- I got to bounce.
- Stop saying that.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.420
This DJ from Dubai is spinning

02:50.504 --> 02:52.256
at an abandoned loading dock
in Bushwick.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.715
I'm worried I don't
have enough layers.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.342
<i>So what if my friends</i>

02:55.342 --> 02:56.552
<i>thought it was doomed?</i>

02:56.552 --> 02:58.929
<i>I was still young, and I knew
that a night of partying</i>

02:58.929 --> 03:00.681
<i>with a girl
over a decade younger than me</i>

03:00.681 --> 03:01.890
<i>would be a total...</i>

03:01.974 --> 03:04.768
...disaster. She's like
an entirely different species.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.522
And I definitely didn't
have enough layers.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.525
<i>I didn't understand half
the words she was saying.</i>

03:11.525 --> 03:14.194
<i>To me, it all sounded
like hipster Mad Libs.</i>

03:14.278 --> 03:15.612
Didn't you check your phone?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.531
I just "means of contacting" you

03:17.531 --> 03:20.367
on "currently hot
social networking site."

03:20.367 --> 03:21.785
The show's been moved
to "New York neighborhood

03:21.869 --> 03:23.161
you've never heard of."

03:25.163 --> 03:28.125
Oh. Wow, my phone has a clock.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.503
<i>And they subsist on a diet of
pointlessly weird combinations.</i>

03:31.587 --> 03:32.588
Ooh.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.173
Hey, do you want to split
a kimchi cupcake

03:34.173 --> 03:35.507
with bacon frosting?

03:35.591 --> 03:36.925
They are the best here.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.594
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that'll go great with my

03:38.594 --> 03:40.470
cucumber jalapeÃ±o
egg cream.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.763
Chug it! Come on. Come on.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.974
- We got to get going.
- Right. Okay.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.896
<i>Then later, at a club
in Chinatown</i>

03:48.896 --> 03:51.064
<i>somehow located
beneath a manhole cover,</i>

03:51.148 --> 03:52.357
<i>it got weird.</i>

03:52.441 --> 03:53.483
God, I just love those

03:53.567 --> 03:56.612
tiny gray hairs
in your eyebrows.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.906
Old men are so sexy.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.658
All right, to be fair,

04:01.742 --> 04:04.620
some of those gray hairs
were dried egg cream.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.746
Turns out, when you

04:05.746 --> 04:08.040
projectile vomit on skates,
you roll right into the spray.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.125
Wait, how old does
she think you are?

04:10.209 --> 04:12.211
So, were you in Vietnam?

04:13.462 --> 04:14.588
Hold that groan.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.509
Charlie was everywhere.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.094
She's hot! She likes old guys!

04:21.178 --> 04:22.596
Don't judge me!

04:22.596 --> 04:25.265
Anyway, when we got out
on the dance floor, th...

04:25.349 --> 04:27.559
I swear, this is what all
the 20-year-olds looked like...

04:32.523 --> 04:35.400
I want to thank you for your
service to this nation, Private.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.527
Colonel.

04:36.527 --> 04:37.653
Aw.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.112
I got to end this.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.739
Yeah, seriously, Ted.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.242
Pretending to be someone else
just to get laid?

04:43.242 --> 04:45.118
That's... embarrassing.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.537
Your Highness!

04:46.537 --> 04:48.038
Let's go.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.333
Ew. Marshall,
take that off.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.585
What? I think it looks
kind of cool.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.711
Cool?

04:54.795 --> 04:57.422
You look like one of those jerks
who's in some lame band

04:57.506 --> 05:01.635
and rides a motorcycle without
a helmet and has a wallet chain

05:01.635 --> 05:03.846
and neck tattoos
and a drug problem.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.390
Not a...a big one, just, uh...

05:06.390 --> 05:09.434
enough that he deals a little
bit on the side, and...

05:09.518 --> 05:12.813
he can never...
ever be true to one woman.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.982
Finish that damn pickle
and do me!

05:19.278 --> 05:21.488
Okay, you guys know how
my mornings usually go.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.865
Why would we care how...

05:22.865 --> 05:24.032
Usually it's like this.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.202
After you.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.829
Aw, thank you.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.335
On the house, Robin!

05:36.628 --> 05:39.089
<i>Take this bagel on the house</i>

05:39.173 --> 05:41.175
<i>Have a paper on the house</i>

05:41.175 --> 05:42.926
<i>I'd give you a house
on the house</i>

05:43.010 --> 05:45.512
<i>If I could</i>

05:45.596 --> 05:47.556
<i>You're so beautiful</i>

05:47.556 --> 05:51.143
<i>Everything in life
should be free</i>

05:51.143 --> 05:56.190
<i>It's so wonderful to be me!</i>

05:56.190 --> 05:57.566
Mmm.

05:57.566 --> 05:58.692
<i>Wow.</i>

05:58.692 --> 06:02.571
Do little bluebirds help you
get dressed in the morning, too?

06:02.571 --> 06:04.323
<i>She's exaggerating</i>

06:04.323 --> 06:09.494
<i>To make a point!</i>

06:10.662 --> 06:12.497
But today was different.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.501
That'll be $3.75.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.586
But I didn't have
to pay yesterday.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.213
Okay. $7.50.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.133
- Oh, honey-sweetie-baby.
- It's the ring, Robin.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.343
The ring has power.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.969
When a woman puts on
an engagement ring,

06:26.053 --> 06:28.305
it's like when Bilbo Baggins
wears the One Ring

06:28.305 --> 06:29.431
in <i>The Hobbit.</i>

06:29.515 --> 06:31.183
Okay, can you say that again
but not in nerd?

06:31.183 --> 06:33.810
Sure. Uh, the ring
is like the cloak

06:33.894 --> 06:36.230
that Harry Potter wears
to sneak around Hogwarts.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.689
Yeah, I don't speak virgin either.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.275
The ring...
it makes you invisible.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.864
You're not precious.

06:55.374 --> 06:56.708
Oh, good, you're awake.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.294
Look, Ted,

06:59.378 --> 07:00.963
there's something
we have to talk about.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.382
Boundaries?
Invasion of privacy?

07:03.382 --> 07:05.592
Losing your key privileges?

07:05.676 --> 07:07.678
It's about the 20-year-old, Ted.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.847
You have to bang her.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.098
For me!

07:15.060 --> 07:17.563
Why do you want me to hook
up with this 20-year-old?

07:17.563 --> 07:18.939
I thought I disgusted you.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.816
Yeah, that was all an act.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.734
Look, look, look, I love Robin

07:22.818 --> 07:25.153
and she's the only girl
I want to be with.

07:25.237 --> 07:29.491
But my body is detoxing
after years of one-night stands.

07:29.575 --> 07:32.661
They don't make gum
or a patch for this, Ted.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.705
But, hey,
billion-dollar idea alert.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.207
Oh, yeah.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.209
That's okay. I'll just buy
a new dream journal.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.589
What-what-what
are you looking for?

07:43.589 --> 07:44.715
Your phone.

07:44.715 --> 07:45.841
There's got to
be some pictures

07:45.841 --> 07:47.009
of her in here.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.552
Damn it. No.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.012
Those are all worthless.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.347
I need some one-night-stand
material, Ted.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.683
Oh. Oh. Here's your mom.
Hello, Virginia.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.769
Um, my mother is not
one-night-stand material.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.147
Yeah, you're right. It wasn't
night and we weren't standing.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.732
Hey-oh!

08:01.732 --> 08:03.525
That didn't happen.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.152
You're right. It didn't.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.278
You just winked.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.654
No, I didn't.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.906
You just did it again!

08:08.906 --> 08:11.325
Look, bottom line: I need you

08:11.325 --> 08:13.493
to proxy bang this girl for me.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.953
Be my stand-in

08:15.037 --> 08:16.663
and put your gland in.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.624
Hey, wow,
that'd be good on a hat.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.083
Barney,

08:20.167 --> 08:23.253
she's just using me
for my gracefully aging body.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.964
You're picking now
to get some self-respect?

08:26.048 --> 08:29.760
You once banged a blind girl by
pretending to be Sean Connery.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.303
That was you.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.596
Yeah, that conquest

08:32.596 --> 08:34.431
was most enjoyable.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.433
I'm sorry.
T-To hook up with a girl,

08:36.517 --> 08:38.435
I have to connect with her
at least a little.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.437
Then find a connection.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.022
Just go simple.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.025
Nothing about weird poets
or buildings

08:45.025 --> 08:47.611
or any of those stupid articles
you've ever e-mailed me

08:47.611 --> 08:50.072
with the subject line
"Food for thought."

08:51.198 --> 08:52.699
Please, Ted.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.409
I need this.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.036
Fine. You win.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.788
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.332
But I'm not gonna enjoy...

09:00.332 --> 09:01.667
Oh, who am I kidding?

09:01.667 --> 09:03.001
It's gonna be awesome.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.629
Now, turn off the lights and go.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.590
Not all the way!

09:11.009 --> 09:12.928
Hello. Yeah, three...

09:12.928 --> 09:15.305
Okay, normally New York
is the friendliest,

09:15.389 --> 09:17.599
most affordable city
in the world.

09:17.683 --> 09:21.103
Now it's as rude and expensive
as San Francisco.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.938
Guys?

09:22.938 --> 09:24.857
Oh, hey, that's life
once you're engaged.

09:24.857 --> 09:28.110
Oh, tell her, baby.
Make it hurt.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.653
I'll be at the booth.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.864
My panties may
or may not be on

09:31.864 --> 09:33.657
when you get there.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.492
They won't be!

09:36.493 --> 09:38.495
Okay, what is going
on with you guys?

09:38.579 --> 09:39.913
It's the cuff.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.165
It turns out that picturing me
as a loser musician

09:42.249 --> 09:44.501
with a Vicodin addiction
and a beat-up van

09:44.585 --> 09:48.380
I use to steal copper wire
really turns Lily's crank.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.631
Who knew?

09:49.715 --> 09:51.341
Whoa, what... what happened
to your wrist?

09:51.425 --> 09:54.344
Oh. It's an allergic reaction.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.762
So take it off.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.890
Robin, once you have a child,

09:57.890 --> 09:59.725
anything that gets you
even remotely close

09:59.725 --> 10:03.687
to the possibility of sex is
worth a few pus-filled blisters.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.731
Better the sores
weep than I.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.984
Hey, hold on. That
slut just got here.

10:08.984 --> 10:11.236
How'd she get
beer already?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.197
Do you see a ring
on that finger?

10:13.197 --> 10:14.865
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.950
Are you saying that
this invisibility thing

10:17.034 --> 10:18.702
means I might not be able
to get beer?

10:18.702 --> 10:21.205
I was just getting used to the
idea of having to pay for coffee

10:21.205 --> 10:22.706
and bagels and rent.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.999
- Rent?
- But not being able

10:23.999 --> 10:26.793
to get a beer? Unacceptable.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.255
Excuse me.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.132
Hot girl coming through.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.559
Huh.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.687
Three beers, please.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.109
<i>Damn it, ring!</i>

10:52.528 --> 10:53.695
- Oh, yeah, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.073
Later you should totally
go out and buy a switchblade.

10:56.073 --> 10:57.449
Mm. Sure.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.202
While I'm out, maybe Daddy
picks up some diapers

11:00.202 --> 11:03.539
and a little mild salsa
because we're low.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.669
<i>Well, you're right...</i>

11:08.669 --> 11:10.128
<i>I'm invisible.</i>

11:16.844 --> 11:18.095
<i>That night, the only person</i>

11:18.095 --> 11:20.931
<i>in worse shape than Robin
was her fiancÃ©.</i>

11:20.931 --> 11:22.933
Ted, I'm desperate.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.726
Earlier today,
I saw that wrist cuff

11:24.810 --> 11:26.812
and I got a partial
for Marshall.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.522
Did you bang that girl yet?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.858
Don't get your hopes,
or anything else, up.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.484
I tried to connect with her,

11:32.568 --> 11:34.027
but everything
just comes back

11:34.111 --> 11:36.321
to her weird fetish
about how old I am.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.741
Well, j-just go simple...
does she like TV?

11:39.825 --> 11:41.076
No.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.744
But I'll watch <i>60 Minutes</i>
with you

11:42.828 --> 11:45.789
as loud and as long as you want.

11:45.873 --> 11:46.999
Sports?

11:46.999 --> 11:48.250
No.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.669
But I bet you look super hot
playing shuffleboard,

11:50.669 --> 11:54.214
just...slathered in Bengay.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.632
Well, does she like books?

11:55.716 --> 11:56.758
No.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.219
But I bet you do.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.429
Mm-hmm.

12:00.429 --> 12:02.681
I bet you have a big, thick

12:02.681 --> 12:04.933
pair of bifocals.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.145
She doesn't have daddy issues,
she has granddaddy issues.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.396
I'm ending it.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.900
Ted, I beg of you, don't quit
on a body that won't quit.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.068
Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet
on a bumper sticker.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.279
That's going in the journal.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.822
Wait, did you steal
my dream journal?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.992
No! Now, get back in there
before all your teeth fall out

12:21.992 --> 12:23.827
and you're naked in front
of Shaker Heights High School

12:23.911 --> 12:25.245
in a play
you never rehearsed for.

12:25.329 --> 12:26.914
Bastard!

12:26.914 --> 12:29.583
We don't connect
on a single thing. It's over.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.502
It's not...

12:31.502 --> 12:33.629
Look, Carly, I got
to tell you something.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.215
I just, I don't see
a future here.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.343
Oh, my God.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.470
Are you dying?

12:41.470 --> 12:43.555
Oh, that is so hot.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.935
Hey...

12:47.935 --> 12:49.853
is that R2-D2?

12:49.937 --> 12:51.897
Do you like <i>Star Wars?</i>

12:51.897 --> 12:54.024
I love <i>Star Wars.</i>

12:54.024 --> 12:55.108
Me, too!

12:58.529 --> 13:00.072
I mean, I've only
seen the new ones.

13:01.907 --> 13:02.950
Close enough.

13:06.912 --> 13:07.996
So?

13:09.498 --> 13:10.916
- Yeah.
- I knew it!

13:10.916 --> 13:12.000
I could feel it.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.586
It's almost like we were
hooking up with her together.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.088
You felt that, right?

13:16.088 --> 13:17.506
I couldn't have performed
if I did.

13:17.506 --> 13:18.966
Don't you see, Ted?

13:18.966 --> 13:21.927
We had a bro-nnection.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.137
All right, I got to know

13:24.221 --> 13:25.514
what she looks like...
show me a picture.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.391
Well, normally,
I'm above such things,

13:27.391 --> 13:30.269
but it's been a while,
and, uh, Teddy's braggin'.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.479
Okay, here she is.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.065
Okay. Scrolling up.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.400
Oh, yeah, those are

13:36.400 --> 13:38.735
- "plow me" heels. Nice.
- Uh-huh.

13:38.819 --> 13:42.155
The knee bruise is encouraging.

13:42.239 --> 13:45.117
Working our way up
to those 20-year-old ta-tas.

13:45.117 --> 13:48.078
Oh...gravity's cruel grasp

13:48.078 --> 13:50.581
hasn't found you yet,
my sweet perky miracles.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.251
Now, let's get a gander
at Dirty Girl's face.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.377
Mm-hmm.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.424
Her face says, "Ready to bone,"
am I right?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.595
I say again, am I right?

14:05.762 --> 14:08.056
That's my half-sister.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.810
Then you probably shouldn't
scroll to the next picture.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.858
No!

14:21.945 --> 14:23.405
That's my sister, Ted!

14:23.405 --> 14:25.240
Well, look, I didn't know!

14:25.324 --> 14:26.783
None of us even knew
you had a sister

14:26.867 --> 14:28.827
until two years ago,
including you!

14:28.911 --> 14:30.746
This is just
some crazy coincidence.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.040
There are four million women
in the city of New York,

14:33.040 --> 14:34.666
Ted, and you sleep
with my sister?

14:34.750 --> 14:37.544
- Why would the universe do that to me?
- I don't know.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.046
It's not like you've ever
treated women in such a way

14:39.046 --> 14:41.465
that would invite some sort
of karmic retribution.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.509
You banged my sister!

14:43.509 --> 14:46.345
My sweet, little, innocent...

14:46.345 --> 14:47.846
- Pierced.
- Really? Where?

14:47.930 --> 14:50.557
Don't answer that!
Now I know

14:50.641 --> 14:53.519
why I felt everything
you did to her last night.

14:53.519 --> 14:57.189
It wasn't a bro-nnection,
it was a sis-nnection!

14:57.189 --> 14:58.357
Oh, my God.

14:58.357 --> 15:01.026
Ted...did you...

15:04.613 --> 15:05.656
Big-time.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.157
Nice! High five!

15:07.241 --> 15:08.492
Wait! No! No!

15:08.492 --> 15:09.993
Retraction five!

15:12.496 --> 15:15.207
Hey, hey, you're the one
who begged for a proxy bang.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.917
And while we're
on the subject of family,

15:16.917 --> 15:19.378
I'm pretty sure you banged
my mom...mom beats sister.

15:19.378 --> 15:21.880
I never banged your mom.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.674
You just did
the winking thing again!

15:23.674 --> 15:25.509
No, I didn't.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.761
Fine. Hey, Barney,
let me ask you something.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.638
Were you, uh, feeling
a little sore this morning?

15:29.638 --> 15:30.848
Especially...

15:34.059 --> 15:35.811
Friendship over!

15:38.105 --> 15:39.731
Oh, yeah.

15:39.815 --> 15:44.403
Who's your guitar-player-biker-
who-couldn't-find-mild-salsa-

15:44.403 --> 15:48.031
but-said-screw-it-
and-went-medium bad boy?

15:49.575 --> 15:51.159
Marshall, your hand!

15:51.243 --> 15:53.370
<i>Okay, I'm pretty sure
it wasn't that bad,</i>

15:53.370 --> 15:56.039
<i>but this is how Uncle Marshall
likes to tell the story.</i>

15:56.123 --> 15:58.792
Oh, yeah, no,
that's the cuff.

15:58.876 --> 16:02.129
I'm woozy,
and I can't flex my fingers...

16:03.297 --> 16:04.923
...and the rotten fish smell
is getting stronger.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.634
But I'm learning to compensate
with my left.

16:07.718 --> 16:10.679
Is that why last night when
I asked you to honka honka me

16:10.679 --> 16:12.598
you only honka'd me?

16:12.598 --> 16:14.474
I didn't think you noticed.

16:14.558 --> 16:17.269
Snap's been jealous
of Crackle all day.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.021
Just take the cuff off.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.273
No, but, baby,
then all the sex will stop.

16:21.273 --> 16:25.694
Marshall, you don't need a cuff
for me to find you sexy.

16:25.694 --> 16:26.987
All you have to do

16:26.987 --> 16:29.323
is smile, and I'm ready
for you to hop on Pop.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.867
Thanks, baby.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.162
Are you too woozy to
do it one last time

16:35.162 --> 16:38.415
before we seek emergency
medical attention?

16:38.415 --> 16:40.292
Only one way to find out.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.460
Mm.

16:46.507 --> 16:49.510
I'm sorry, bro,
I totally overreacted.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.220
You think?
I can't believe

16:51.220 --> 16:53.430
you're allowed
to ship a dead possum.

16:53.514 --> 16:55.057
He died?

16:55.057 --> 16:58.310
That possum was supposed
to be an olive branch.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.438
Are you sure
he's not just playing dead?

17:01.522 --> 17:03.732
He smells like Marshall's hand.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.484
And wait, you-you forgive me?

17:05.484 --> 17:07.986
Absolutely.
Hey, I got a couple "cee-gars."

17:08.070 --> 17:09.404
Get over here!

17:09.488 --> 17:11.782
All right.
So, where are those "cee-gars"?

17:11.782 --> 17:13.033
Eh, we'll break 'em
out in a minute.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.035
Hey, Barn.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.664
Ted?

17:18.664 --> 17:20.165
Barney, what is
your sister doing here?

17:20.249 --> 17:22.125
Nothing, bro.
Or should I say,

17:22.209 --> 17:24.670
bro-in-law!

17:37.057 --> 17:38.308
Congratulations!

17:38.392 --> 17:40.978
You're marrying
my sister!

17:40.978 --> 17:44.147
And you spared no expense,
you big crazy!

17:47.317 --> 17:49.194
You know what?
I love Barney,

17:49.278 --> 17:50.779
but this ring thing sucks.

17:50.863 --> 17:53.365
Some gross guy just
brushed up against my rack

17:53.365 --> 17:54.908
and then apologized.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.743
And I think he really,
really meant it.

17:56.827 --> 18:00.873
Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice
to be groped by strangers,

18:00.873 --> 18:02.666
but nothing beats
the rush you get

18:02.666 --> 18:05.544
when that one special person
looks at you.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.379
It's true.

18:07.379 --> 18:11.341
Like here in this bar, there's
only one thing that I see,

18:11.425 --> 18:13.927
and I see her brighter
and more clearly

18:14.011 --> 18:16.138
than anything else
in this world.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.974
You know what that is?

18:18.974 --> 18:21.059
That's love.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.561
And possibly alcohol

18:22.561 --> 18:25.981
mixed with some
very powerful antibiotics.

18:27.566 --> 18:30.068
And that's how Barney sees you.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.321
And I know that's
how you see Barney.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.408
I'd like
to start the service

18:36.408 --> 18:39.661
with a passage
from Ted's dream journal.

18:39.745 --> 18:41.163
"Drowning.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.498
"Gasping for air.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.334
No escape."

18:45.334 --> 18:47.794
Wait, is that
about Vietnam?

18:47.878 --> 18:49.046
It's about Whole Foods.

18:49.046 --> 18:52.049
Barney, we are not
getting married.

18:52.049 --> 18:55.135
And those aisles
are too narrow!

18:55.219 --> 18:56.386
But you two

18:56.470 --> 18:58.138
have to get married...
otherwise, it's just

18:58.222 --> 19:01.600
a cheap, meaningless,
disgusting one-night stand.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.686
Wait, just to be clear,
you're saying you're opposed

19:04.770 --> 19:07.147
to cheap, meaningless,
disgusting one-night stands?

19:07.231 --> 19:08.440
Yes.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.609
Barney... don't you see?

19:10.609 --> 19:12.402
Your detox is done!

19:12.486 --> 19:14.696
You're over one-night stands!

19:14.780 --> 19:17.282
Oh, my God, you're right!

19:17.366 --> 19:18.492
- I'm free!
- Yeah.

19:18.492 --> 19:21.995
So if you think about it...
but not too much...

19:22.079 --> 19:24.665
it's actually good that
Carly and I hooked up.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.333
Yeah, it's really good.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.669
I mean, this guy goes at it
like he's still in his 50s.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.256
Hey, have a cigar,
you big crazy!

19:33.966 --> 19:35.175
Hey, don't try
to make this okay.

19:35.259 --> 19:36.760
You still slept with my sister.

19:36.844 --> 19:40.430
Promise me you will never,
ever do that again.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.349
I promise.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.600
You just winked.

19:43.684 --> 19:44.852
No, I didn't.

19:44.852 --> 19:47.479
- You did it again!
- No, I didn't!

19:47.563 --> 19:49.231
You swear, right?

19:49.231 --> 19:51.441
Yeah. Of course.

19:56.530 --> 19:57.573
<i>That night,</i>

19:57.573 --> 19:59.992
<i>even though
she still couldn't get a beer,</i>

19:59.992 --> 20:03.912
<i>Robin realized
the true power of the ring.</i>

20:03.996 --> 20:07.082
<i>So you got the moon
and I got midnight</i>

20:07.082 --> 20:10.335
<i>You are patient
and I'm always on time, oh...</i>

20:10.419 --> 20:11.461
Hey, Robin.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.172
Did you ever figure out
how you're gonna get

20:13.172 --> 20:14.882
a drink at the bar now
that you're engaged?

20:14.882 --> 20:17.843
Oh, sure. I know a way
that's gonna last forever.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.219
Scotch on the rocks?

20:19.303 --> 20:20.304
Coming right up.

20:26.727 --> 20:30.189
Now, before you say anything
about the hat...

20:30.189 --> 20:33.192
this new girl's ass
is phenomenal!

20:38.739 --> 20:40.282
Hey, Marshall,
you got to see this.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.409
The catalog must have
mixed up my order.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.703
You won't believe the jeans
they just sent me.

20:45.913 --> 20:47.873
Hilarious, right?

20:49.166 --> 20:50.709
Totally.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.002
You look like some

20:52.002 --> 20:54.171
suburban mom
who drives a minivan

20:54.171 --> 20:57.257
filled with stale Cheerios
and empty juice boxes...

20:57.341 --> 20:59.635
probably makes

20:59.635 --> 21:02.387
chili mac and
Frito pie for dinner...

21:02.471 --> 21:04.806
smells like that menthol
cigarette that she snuck while

21:04.890 --> 21:06.642
she was waiting
to pick her kids up

21:06.642 --> 21:09.144
from hockey practice.
Get over here!
