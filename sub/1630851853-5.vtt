00:03.570 --> 00:05.038
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL ONES
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.537
My house! My son!

01:27.821 --> 01:28.988
Sit down, man.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.506
Be careful,
it has no safety catch.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.486
Is everything alright?

02:34.287 --> 02:36.789
Everything's fine, honey.
Go to sleep.

04:07.013 --> 04:09.983
THE FRAGILITY OF BODIES

04:26.165 --> 04:27.934
Hello.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.435
Hi.

04:29.836 --> 04:33.406
I'm a journalist writing
a piece on local sports clubs.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.375
Anyone I can talk to about it?

04:35.441 --> 04:36.376
I'll go get him.

04:36.976 --> 04:37.977
Thanks.

05:08.775 --> 05:09.609
Hello.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.211
Hi, how are you?

05:12.578 --> 05:14.781
-I'm Julia Malajovich.
-Nice to meet you.

05:15.114 --> 05:16.182
I work for a local journal...

05:16.516 --> 05:17.950
and I'm writing an article
about local sports clubs.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.152
Which journal?

05:19.218 --> 05:21.621
It's a small publication,
"Sports at home".

05:21.954 --> 05:23.723
I'm sorry I didn't bring
any copies...

05:24.057 --> 05:26.459
Yes, I know it.
So what do you need?

05:26.526 --> 05:27.894
The basics.

05:28.261 --> 05:32.632
I'd like to know about the club,
how and when it was founded,

05:32.699 --> 05:34.000
how many leagues it has.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.602
Are you the club's president?

05:36.969 --> 05:38.871
No, I'm the coach.
But it's almost the same.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.074
I appreciate it,
but we're not interested.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.110
But it won't cost you a penny.
This is a non-profit thing.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.813
It's about letting parents know
where to take their kids...

05:47.213 --> 05:49.515
Yes, but we're not interested.
Thank you.

05:50.817 --> 05:51.684
Anything else?

05:52.151 --> 05:54.087
No. Thank you very much.

05:54.587 --> 05:56.189
Good luck.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.797
He's a man of few words,
isn't he?

06:05.164 --> 06:06.466
Yes, a little.

06:06.799 --> 06:07.934
Can I have some chips?

06:09.969 --> 06:12.271
-What's his name?
-Rivero.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.308
Just Rivero. Nothing else?

06:15.775 --> 06:18.111
Yes. I have no idea
what his first name is.

06:18.444 --> 06:19.512
Never mind.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.648
That's my luck. I think
I caught him on a bad day.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.284
He wouldn't listen to me.
But I'm sure that if I insist,

06:25.618 --> 06:26.686
I'll win him over.

06:27.019 --> 06:28.187
Here's what I'll do.

06:28.654 --> 06:29.922
I'll give you my number...

06:30.256 --> 06:32.225
so you can call me
in case he changes his mind.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.497
-I'm Julia.
-Julia.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.332
Thank you.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.534
Bye.

06:52.378 --> 06:53.679
Do you want me to do it?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.181
No.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.483
So finish telling me.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.552
There's not much more.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.487
From his house
to the office and back.

07:01.854 --> 07:02.955
Always the same thing.

07:04.557 --> 07:08.027
I don't like routine.
It's dangerous.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.363
It says something about someone.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.232
It says he's methodical,
for example.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.035
I don't like methodical men.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.337
Be on your guard.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.841
There's something else.
Rivero called.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.444
-What does he want?
-He wants to see you.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.846
-What for?
-I don't know. He didn't say.

07:27.713 --> 07:28.915
What should I tell him?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.316
Nothing.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.564
He won't do anything
unless I tell him to.

07:47.433 --> 07:48.901
Two laps?

07:49.335 --> 07:50.336
Three.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.040
If he wants to eat,
he has to earn it.

08:12.992 --> 08:13.926
Go.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.261
Victoria wants me to go with her
to Navarro.

09:22.628 --> 09:23.829
When?

09:23.896 --> 09:25.398
This weekend.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.533
I have to work.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.502
Yes, I know.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.637
That's why
I'd be bringing the kids along.

09:31.704 --> 09:33.439
We'll be back Sunday evening.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.207
Alright.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.643
It's Laucha.

09:42.815 --> 09:43.883
Hello?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.787
Hey. I left a lot of messages.
You wouldn't answer.

09:47.853 --> 09:49.755
I couldn't. What do you need?

09:50.156 --> 09:52.224
I want to talk to your friend,
Malvino.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.594
No, you can't talk to him,
I told you.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.362
I talked to Romerito.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.397
When does he go to therapy?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.333
I don't really remember.

10:00.700 --> 10:01.634
You do know, Lucio.

10:01.968 --> 10:04.136
You said you went
to pick him up once.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.339
No, I don't remember.
I think it's Thursday.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.207
Today's Thursday,
so he'll be there.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.409
Is it the same therapist
Carranza was seeing?

10:10.776 --> 10:14.547
Sure, we'll talk about it
when we meet.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.349
Okay.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.919
-Everything alright?
-Yes.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.054
Laucha needs me to cover for him
at work.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.990
Right now?

10:25.257 --> 10:27.526
So you won't take care
of the kids today?

10:28.160 --> 10:29.795
Can you do this for me?

10:32.031 --> 10:33.466
I'll get your lunch bag ready.

11:47.573 --> 11:48.674
What do you want?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.878
-Don't be so cagey.
-I'm not.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.884
What is it?

11:59.452 --> 12:01.387
A game, what do you think?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.126
You're not going
to the club anymore?

12:07.760 --> 12:09.061
That's none of your business.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.130
Relax, it's just a question.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.232
Then don't ask me
any more about the club.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.101
Fine!

12:20.506 --> 12:22.475
-So what happened?
-With what?

12:22.808 --> 12:24.343
At the club. What happened?

12:24.710 --> 12:26.312
Is it about the money
they're giving you?

12:26.645 --> 12:29.415
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to ask about it.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.649
Are you stupid?

12:31.016 --> 12:33.352
I just want to know.
I know something happened.

12:33.719 --> 12:36.455
You know shit. Get lost.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.959
-Then I'll go myself.
-Go where?

12:40.292 --> 12:42.261
-To the club.
-You're not going.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.232
Yes, I'll go and say I want
to make money like you do.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.701
You're not going anywhere,
get it?

12:49.034 --> 12:49.902
Let go!

12:50.269 --> 12:52.705
You blabbed once
and got me into trouble.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.608
Come on, let go of me.

12:57.209 --> 13:00.412
-Promise me you won't go.
-The hell I will.

13:00.746 --> 13:01.947
I do whatever I want.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.581
Malvino.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.049
Hello.

13:37.416 --> 13:38.951
I'm a journalist.
My name's Verónica Rosenthal.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.487
Can I ask you some questions
about what happened?

13:41.954 --> 13:44.990
I'm friends with Lucio Valrossa,
your workmate.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.226
I was with him when he heard
about the accident.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.727
Yes, I know who you are.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.764
-It's only a few minutes.
-I don't want to talk about it.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.332
Let alone to journalists.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.734
I think I have some information
about the kid that died.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.736
-But I don't want to hear...
-His name was Vicente.

13:58.103 --> 13:59.104
They called him Vincen.

13:59.471 --> 14:02.274
Go fuck yourself, bitch!

14:11.083 --> 14:12.818
It was crazy for you
to go to that club.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.987
-Just crazy.
-Maybe.

14:15.321 --> 14:18.390
But the good thing is now I know
those guys are involved.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.059
At least the coach is.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.293
How do you know?
You found nothing.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.263
I'm sure of it, Fede.
You should've been there.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.332
You should've seen how he acted.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.534
Rivero is hiding something.

14:28.901 --> 14:31.070
That guy
has a very dirty secret.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.740
You don't believe me.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.776
I don't care.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.279
If this isn't enough for you,
I will go back anyway.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.313
What for?

14:41.647 --> 14:44.850
I'll go back and ask
about Vincen straight up.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.318
I'll say his body
is at the morgue, unidentified,

14:46.652 --> 14:48.354
and see how he reacts.
That guy is involved.

14:48.687 --> 14:50.756
Are you aware of what
you're getting yourself into?

14:51.190 --> 14:53.225
Do you really want
to blow the lid off this?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.461
Don't go to the police.
Go to the courts.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.130
Go see a judge
and tell him everything.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.399
Don't you know any judges?
I know plenty.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.469
You're a lawyer.
I don't have any evidence.

15:03.869 --> 15:07.106
If I go to the courts,
nothing will happen.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.607
Worst of all,
they'll know I'm onto them,

15:08.974 --> 15:11.277
so everything I got so far
will be lost.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.082
Why don't you
tell it like it is?

15:17.416 --> 15:18.851
What do you mean?

15:19.218 --> 15:21.020
You're only interested
in your article. Aren't you?

15:23.088 --> 15:26.959
You're the second guy
to tell me that in a week.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.395
What is it?
Am I so inscrutable...

15:29.728 --> 15:31.964
that not even someone fucking me
knows who I am?

15:32.298 --> 15:33.332
No, but you can't take the law
into your own hands.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.900
I know I can't.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.268
But since those responsible
are doing nothing,

15:36.635 --> 15:37.937
I have no other way out.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.040
-I didn't mean you.
-Yeah, you did.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.276
Yes, you also meant me.
But that's fine.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.947
The only thing that matters is
that you stop risking yourself.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.982
Do you have anything else
on this Rivero guy?

15:50.316 --> 15:52.151
-Phone number, first name?
-No.

15:52.584 --> 15:53.752
Never mind.
I will start with that.

15:54.086 --> 15:56.388
Rivero, coach. We'll see.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.259
-I'm sorry.
-I know you are.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.261
But go to hell.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.442
DAD

16:40.532 --> 16:41.500
Hey, listen.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.170
I wanted to say I'm sorry
about the other day,

16:45.504 --> 16:47.172
what I said about drugs.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.274
Drugs are shit. You have
nothing to do with that.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.211
But I freaked out because...

16:52.678 --> 16:54.780
Because of Peque.
He's a hell of a player.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.582
I don't know
how I'll replace him.

16:56.982 --> 16:58.417
That's it.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.255
I'm not playing dumb, okay?

17:03.622 --> 17:04.823
You know I take the kids away...

17:05.190 --> 17:06.759
for night games
to make some money.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.528
And they play really rough
over there.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.197
So Peque saw that
and didn't want to come back.

17:12.664 --> 17:15.334
So I thought
since you have an eye for that,

17:15.701 --> 17:16.835
you might give me
a hand with it.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.204
What about Martín?
I brought him last time.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.073
I thought about him already.
But I need someone else.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.309
I don't know
where to find them anymore.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.178
I don't know
where to look for them.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.449
That's fine.
You're working for a paycheck.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.151
I'll pay double.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.420
Find me a kid that can make it,

17:34.753 --> 17:35.954
and I'll pay you double.

17:36.422 --> 17:37.489
What's this?

17:37.856 --> 17:39.324
The paper
that girl works for?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.261
Yes, her name's Malajovich
or something.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.463
I didn't read it.
You can have it.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.365
No.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.367
I'll pay triple.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.403
Get me a kid like El Peque
and I'll pay triple.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.006
That's some money.
Think about it.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.957
Tell her.
Tell her what you told me.

18:12.357 --> 18:13.859
I'm scared.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.428
Don't be scared.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.332
You can tell me
anything you want. Really.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.234
I want to help you.

18:25.471 --> 18:29.208
The other day,
right after you guys came over,

18:29.608 --> 18:31.310
I talked to my mom.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.480
And I told her about Vincen.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.983
At first,
she wouldn't believe me.

18:38.417 --> 18:42.688
And then, as days went by,
and my brother didn't come back,

18:43.055 --> 18:44.189
she got really scared.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.158
And she went to the police.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.029
So what happened?

18:51.463 --> 18:52.498
I don't know.

18:52.865 --> 18:56.135
But the next day, some men
came over to threaten us.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.204
They told my mom that if she
didn't want any more dead kids,

18:59.571 --> 19:01.940
that she should go back
to Santiago del Estero.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.409
They gave her a house
in Monte Quemado...

19:04.776 --> 19:07.012
and a check for 10 000 pesos.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.551
Tell her what they said
they would do...

19:12.918 --> 19:14.419
if you didn't leave.

19:16.355 --> 19:19.391
They told her
that they would rape me...

19:19.725 --> 19:21.326
and my little brother.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.363
And then
they would set us on fire.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.904
Those fucking bastards.

19:35.073 --> 19:38.710
Where is the check?
Do you know?

19:39.111 --> 19:42.748
I don't know.
I think she already cashed it.

19:44.249 --> 19:47.619
Do you know who signed it?
Any last name you remember?

19:48.453 --> 19:51.390
No.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.528
But I know where it was from.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.433
It said "Department of Housing
and Development".

20:12.744 --> 20:13.912
That was good.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.415
I don't know
why he's taking so long.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.417
Where does Peque live?

20:18.850 --> 20:21.186
In the room up front.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.869
Peque.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.708
Peque, I'm Rafael,
Martina's dad. Are you there?

20:43.041 --> 20:44.309
I'd like to talk to you.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.211
Did Rivero send you?

20:47.846 --> 20:49.081
No. Why?

20:50.949 --> 20:52.718
No reason.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.355
Listen, Peque,

20:56.722 --> 20:59.057
I talked to Martina.
She said you're not doing well.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.026
I want to know what's wrong.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.829
I'm a little sick
but I'll be alright soon.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.666
Look, I also talked to Rivero...

21:08.066 --> 21:09.668
and he told me
about what you all did.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.603
You don't have to be afraid.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.339
I'm not afraid. It's fine,
but I won't go there anymore.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.674
Okay,
but that's not why I'm here.

21:16.074 --> 21:17.676
I'd like us to talk,
you and me.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.711
I want you
to tell me what's wrong.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.581
I have a tummy ache. Now go.

21:23.815 --> 21:24.783
Has he done something to you?

21:25.117 --> 21:26.451
-Who?
-Rivero.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.522
Has he done anything to you?
Tell me.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.024
Leave me alone.

21:34.192 --> 21:36.028
Just go.

21:46.905 --> 21:48.407
How's everything coming along?

21:50.208 --> 21:51.677
Perfectly.

21:52.277 --> 21:54.279
We can't make any mistakes.

21:54.713 --> 21:57.916
Don't worry.
We have it all under control...

21:58.250 --> 21:59.918
so the blood
won't get on our hands.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.920
Yeah, that's fine,

22:01.987 --> 22:03.855
but then a kid dies...

22:04.189 --> 22:06.958
and you have to buy off
the cops, the kid's family...

22:07.025 --> 22:08.060
You know how it goes.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.329
Why don't you shut the fuck up
and enjoy the landscape?

22:18.870 --> 22:20.238
Good luck.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.595
Hello, Juan, long time no see.

22:43.962 --> 22:46.231
Not as long as I would like.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.968
They said
you wanted to talk to me.

22:50.335 --> 22:52.871
No, I was just wondering
if we should go on with this.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.209
What kind of question is that?

22:57.642 --> 23:00.212
With this whole thing
about the train operator...

23:00.278 --> 23:01.146
and now the kid...

23:01.480 --> 23:02.514
What happened?

23:02.914 --> 23:04.282
I don't know.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.685
He was a smart kid,

23:06.752 --> 23:08.086
but he got sloppy
and the train ran him over.

23:08.453 --> 23:10.856
It's only logical.
If we look for brave kids,

23:11.223 --> 23:14.326
that will happen
now and then, right?

23:14.659 --> 23:16.862
Sure, we need a brave kid,
one who can take it.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.497
Of course.

23:18.830 --> 23:22.334
Who would want to bet for a kid
that runs away from the train?

23:22.734 --> 23:24.603
Right, that's what I'm saying.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.706
But it was bad timing.

23:28.106 --> 23:30.475
It wasn't the right time.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.145
There's people breathing
down my neck...

23:33.211 --> 23:35.213
and I like to see them
face to face.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.449
And you know that.

23:37.783 --> 23:40.585
That's why you asked
that question.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.825
How are we for the next game?

23:47.159 --> 23:49.561
We're set. I got a kid
who's unstoppable.

23:49.628 --> 23:50.562
I'm missing one but...

23:50.929 --> 23:54.499
If you're missing one,
then we're not set.

23:56.802 --> 23:57.936
How about the one who won?

23:58.303 --> 24:00.439
No, won't come back.
He's scared.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.444
If he gets out of line,
you know what to do, right?

24:05.777 --> 24:07.646
Yes, it's all under control.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.549
We'll lay low for a while
after this,

24:10.882 --> 24:12.918
let the dust settle.

24:13.251 --> 24:14.820
Even if that girl
got the message,

24:15.153 --> 24:17.589
we need to be on our guard.
Understood?

24:18.256 --> 24:19.458
Which girl?

24:21.393 --> 24:23.728
God damn it, you're so useless!

24:24.062 --> 24:26.264
The girl at the station
who was asking questions.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.733
We had to teach her a lesson.
Didn't you hear?

24:28.800 --> 24:29.668
No.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.103
A journalist came by the club.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.472
She wanted to write an article
about local sports clubs.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.407
Some Julia Malajovich.

24:35.774 --> 24:38.944
I bought the paper to check
her name and it was there.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.649
That's her.

24:58.597 --> 25:01.266
You should know that even
if I requested the interview,

25:01.633 --> 25:03.068
it was her idea.

25:03.134 --> 25:04.302
No, not only mine.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.305
I represent a group
of young Christians...

25:07.372 --> 25:10.775
who give whatever help we can
to priests like Father Pedro,

25:11.109 --> 25:12.944
who's working
at these poor neighborhoods.

25:13.311 --> 25:16.982
We're working at Ciudad Oculta,
Villa 31, Villa 1-11-14,

25:17.315 --> 25:19.584
as well as Villa Palito
and Los Piletones.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.653
And what's your organization
called?

25:21.987 --> 25:24.523
We don't have a name,
we're not even an organization.

25:24.923 --> 25:26.458
We're only a few people,

25:26.791 --> 25:29.294
but we're very willing to help
and become a bigger group.

25:29.794 --> 25:32.264
These days
we need to try and help...

25:32.664 --> 25:34.299
those who are giving their time
to help others.

25:34.633 --> 25:35.500
That's for sure.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.502
So tell me, what do you need?

25:37.836 --> 25:39.371
We need lots of things.

25:39.738 --> 25:40.972
But first of all,
we need a soup kitchen.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.742
We have many kids with us
and only two facilities.

25:44.109 --> 25:45.110
It's not enough to hold them.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.012
So you need a place
where you can set it up?

25:47.412 --> 25:48.580
Yes, that's right.

25:48.947 --> 25:51.283
An old house, a warehouse,
something like that.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.852
And if necessary, we'll also
need the money to refurbish it.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.020
Of course.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.889
We thought that talking to you
might help us get somewhere.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.125
You got the right person.

26:00.458 --> 26:03.395
That's right.
I manage the funding.

26:03.828 --> 26:06.464
I decide who gets housing
and who doesn't.

26:06.798 --> 26:09.034
Not randomly, of course.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.037
What I mean is I don't need
anyone's approval to do it.

26:12.470 --> 26:14.005
If you come
with the right proposal,

26:14.372 --> 26:15.974
we ask no questions here.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.810
So you're the one
who signs the checks?

26:19.177 --> 26:21.313
That's exactly right.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.249
Are you interested in hunting?

26:24.649 --> 26:25.550
No.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.953
Those horns
just caught my eye.

26:28.286 --> 26:31.156
It's a red deer,
a beautiful animal.

26:31.523 --> 26:33.191
There's a plain in La Pampa...

26:33.558 --> 26:35.994
where red deer
and wild boar are hunted.

26:36.361 --> 26:37.529
I've never been to La Pampa.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.665
I've had some great seasons.

26:41.032 --> 26:43.735
I have lots of friends there,
hunting partners.

26:44.069 --> 26:46.571
We all share this passion.

26:47.005 --> 26:50.041
Forgive my enthusiasm.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.177
I hope this won't shock you.

26:52.510 --> 26:56.648
Hunting
is a very noble activity,

26:57.048 --> 26:59.117
it entails respect.

26:59.484 --> 27:02.988
As long as it's practiced
whenever it's authorized.

27:04.723 --> 27:07.759
So, in order to move forward,

27:07.826 --> 27:11.463
I need you to give me an idea
of the size the place will have,

27:11.796 --> 27:14.299
and all needed amenities.

27:14.699 --> 27:15.900
That's the guy, isn't it?

27:16.234 --> 27:17.469
You heard him.

27:17.836 --> 27:21.339
He has access to public funds,
he answers to no one.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.642
He basically does
whatever the hell he wants.

27:23.708 --> 27:24.943
So how do we go on with this?

27:25.276 --> 27:26.811
Look,

27:27.145 --> 27:30.382
you've helped so much
up to this point.

27:30.448 --> 27:31.783
But I would suggest...

27:32.150 --> 27:33.585
that you don't get
any more involved.

27:33.918 --> 27:36.187
I have to go back home.
I'll take a cab.

27:36.521 --> 27:37.355
Do you need a ride?

27:37.722 --> 27:40.325
No, I prefer to walk...

27:40.392 --> 27:42.427
and think about everything
that I did today.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.428
What did you do?

27:43.828 --> 27:45.530
I must have broken
at least two commandments.

27:45.597 --> 27:49.067
No. You helped many kids
avoid ending up like Vincen.

27:49.434 --> 27:50.802
Look at it that way.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.324
We need to talk.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.528
CLEAR RULES, BETTER SOCCER.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.530
ONE MATCH FOUND.
RIVERO, GUSTAVO ALFREDO

28:22.167 --> 28:24.536
SEARCH BY ID NUMBER

28:35.680 --> 28:37.882
-Did you talk to Verónica?
-Yes.

28:38.283 --> 28:39.384
And?

28:39.851 --> 28:41.352
Did you read the article?

28:41.419 --> 28:43.354
Yes, I did,
but I got nothing from that.

28:43.755 --> 28:45.123
She never leaves
things unfinished.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.493
The article said nothing about
the kids or trains or anything.

28:50.228 --> 28:53.298
I don't know what to tell you.
She's an adult and...

28:53.665 --> 28:56.367
Yes, I know Verónica,
she's my daughter.

28:56.434 --> 28:59.237
She's smart, she's stubborn,
she's good at what she does.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.739
That's an explosive combination.

29:01.106 --> 29:02.707
So if she's caught up
in some mess,

29:03.074 --> 29:04.809
you need to tell me, Federico.

29:05.543 --> 29:06.745
Yes, of course.

29:08.279 --> 29:09.314
Excuse me.

29:10.348 --> 29:11.783
Hello?

29:11.850 --> 29:13.785
Hey, Fede. Can you come over?

29:14.119 --> 29:15.253
Did something happen?

29:15.820 --> 29:18.389
I think I got a good tip-off.
I'll tell you when you get here.

29:18.723 --> 29:21.693
Okay. I'll come over later.

29:23.027 --> 29:24.429
Was that her?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.431
No, it was someone else.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.301
Remember what I told you.
I'm counting on you.

29:53.491 --> 29:54.359
Hey.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.394
-Where's Rivero?
-Why do you ask?

29:56.795 --> 29:59.130
I just wanted
to tell him something.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.733
No, he's not here.
But you can tell me.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.667
What's up?

30:03.034 --> 30:04.269
Nothing.
I'll come some other time.

30:04.335 --> 30:07.705
Wait, hold on.
So how's Peque doing?

30:08.039 --> 30:09.107
He's doing fine.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.301
Look, that's him.

30:37.068 --> 30:38.803
We're on the right track.

30:41.139 --> 30:42.841
Yes, I think we are.

30:42.907 --> 30:46.010
I think I found your Rivero.
Is that him?

30:47.312 --> 30:48.479
Yes, that's him.

30:50.915 --> 30:54.018
-Gustavo Alfredo Baltusis.
-Baltusis.

30:54.352 --> 30:57.255
Rivero was a nickname.
He's facing lawsuits...

30:57.622 --> 31:00.358
from the Lomas de Zamora
and Morón courts.

31:00.425 --> 31:02.026
They're all for street fighting.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.329
Before moving to Buenos Aires
he used to live in La Pampa.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.364
Yes, he's facing more lawsuits
over there.

31:06.731 --> 31:07.899
For human trafficking.

31:09.567 --> 31:12.770
This bastard
organizes the competitions.

31:13.171 --> 31:16.641
This bastard gets the kids.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.843
This other bastard...

31:18.910 --> 31:21.679
signs off the checks
to silence the families.

31:22.647 --> 31:23.748
So what do you think?

31:26.751 --> 31:29.587
I think you made it.
Good job. Very good.

31:29.954 --> 31:32.023
No, the hardest part
is yet to come.

31:32.357 --> 31:33.691
I need to prove this.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.995
You know your dad
has been asking questions...

31:37.061 --> 31:38.830
-Don't tell him anything.
-I won't but he'll insist.

31:39.163 --> 31:40.131
He's no fool.

31:40.498 --> 31:43.001
Then I'll talk to him later
to reassure him.

31:43.368 --> 31:44.736
There's something else.

31:45.303 --> 31:48.506
I talked to López Correa.
Remember?

31:48.873 --> 31:51.175
Yes, the district attorney
in Carranza's case.

31:51.542 --> 31:52.610
What did he say?

31:53.011 --> 31:54.746
He said Carranza's death case
is closed,

31:54.812 --> 31:56.948
and Valrossa got the gun back.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.084
It's his gun.
What's wrong with that?

32:00.418 --> 32:01.653
I don't know.

32:01.719 --> 32:02.954
You tell me.

32:04.522 --> 32:06.391
I almost fell for it.

32:06.891 --> 32:09.527
But something didn't add up.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.064
Luckily I figured it out.

32:15.833 --> 32:17.235
What will we do?

32:18.169 --> 32:20.038
I don't know.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.840
The girl's dad
is a very important lawyer.

32:23.908 --> 32:26.344
Since when are you afraid
of important lawyers?

32:26.411 --> 32:30.381
I'm not afraid
of important lawyers.

32:30.715 --> 32:32.517
I'm afraid of this guy.

32:33.251 --> 32:37.889
Well, it's not fear,
but respect.

32:39.557 --> 32:42.293
But it's true,
something must be done.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.978
Come on, I need to pee.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.699
Lucio?

33:42.153 --> 33:44.455
MARIANA

37:49.133 --> 37:52.069
HÉCTOR AMANTE,
RAILWAY WORKERS UNION LEADER

38:22.233 --> 38:24.068
-Are those for Martina?
-No.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.661
Hi, how are you?
I'm Rafael, Martina's dad.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.196
I'm looking for Peque.
Is he in?

38:52.530 --> 38:53.831
No, he's not here.

38:53.898 --> 38:55.533
Why don't you check the roof?
They're always up there.

38:55.900 --> 38:56.934
-That's where I'll find him?
-Yes.

38:57.301 --> 38:58.502
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

39:13.718 --> 39:14.785
Hey there.

39:15.219 --> 39:17.288
I brought some snacks and sodas.

39:17.822 --> 39:20.257
-What do you want?
-To talk to you.

39:20.624 --> 39:23.928
-Where's Dientes?
-What do you need him for?

39:24.428 --> 39:26.664
He came over by the club
yesterday to talk to Rivero.

39:26.997 --> 39:28.666
I'd like to know
what they talked about.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.169
Come on, Peque,

39:32.536 --> 39:33.904
you need to tell me
what's going on.

39:34.238 --> 39:36.774
-I can't.
-Why not? Because of Rivero?

39:37.108 --> 39:39.009
Did he threaten you?
Did he say anything to you?

39:43.247 --> 39:44.281
Listen to me.

39:44.749 --> 39:46.083
Please listen to me.

39:46.450 --> 39:49.186
I'm not like him.
Trust me, Peque.

39:49.253 --> 39:50.888
I only get some kids for him
for money.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.424
But I have nothing to do with
those games he takes you to.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.259
I know they're rough
but I don't know anything else.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.061
Which games?

39:57.695 --> 40:00.398
What do you mean? Those night
games they take them to.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.134
That's a lie.
Who told you that?

40:03.501 --> 40:05.369
What do you mean it's a lie?
Rivero told me that.

40:05.770 --> 40:09.407
It's not soccer games.
It's games of dare.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.008
What?

40:11.342 --> 40:14.545
Yes, Rivero takes me and some
other kid to the railway tracks.

40:14.879 --> 40:16.614
To see who can stay there
the longer.

40:17.014 --> 40:18.349
I don't understand.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.251
They have a competition
at the railway tracks...

40:20.618 --> 40:21.752
and whoever lasts longer
does what?

40:22.119 --> 40:25.322
Rivero takes me and another kid
to the tracks, right?

40:25.389 --> 40:28.492
The one who stays longer
before the train comes wins.

40:33.464 --> 40:36.100
He died because of me.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.640
Because I took too long to jump
and he just couldn't make it.

40:49.747 --> 40:51.916
Hello.
I'd like to file a report.

40:51.982 --> 40:53.350
They're killing kids
at the railway tracks.

40:53.717 --> 40:55.119
They make them compete
for money.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.053
Calm down...

40:56.387 --> 40:57.922
Listen to me, it's my fault, ok?

40:58.322 --> 41:00.024
It's my fault
because I brought them over!

41:00.458 --> 41:02.126
I talked them
into playing for that club...

41:02.460 --> 41:03.861
and they're dying because of me!
Do you understand?

41:04.261 --> 41:06.630
Officer, I'll take it from here.

41:07.031 --> 41:09.767
Calm down.
I'm the commissioner.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.503
-I'll take care of this.
-Thank you.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.405
-Follow me, please.
-Thank you very much.

41:43.067 --> 41:44.702
Lucio?

42:08.325 --> 42:10.728
Don't worry,
I'll take care of this for you.

42:11.095 --> 42:13.063
Amante, I'm Lucio Valrossa.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.232
We met at the last
delegates elections.

42:15.299 --> 42:16.166
What happened?

42:16.500 --> 42:19.169
I need to talk to you.
In private.

42:19.603 --> 42:21.472
Come into my office.
I'll be right back.

42:21.972 --> 42:24.975
Don't worry,
I'll take care of this for you.

42:32.783 --> 42:34.118
Did Chaca win?

42:34.818 --> 42:35.953
Rafa?

42:45.296 --> 42:47.665
Is something wrong, Rafa?
You're acting weird.

42:47.998 --> 42:49.233
Come on, take the money.

42:49.600 --> 42:50.834
What are you doing?

42:52.570 --> 42:55.372
-Rafa?
-Let go of me, fucking chink!

43:29.139 --> 43:30.140
What are you doing?

43:32.443 --> 43:34.211
You need to think
before you speak.

43:34.545 --> 43:38.349
This is what you get when you
can't keep your mouth shut.

44:11.749 --> 44:13.884
VÍCTOR R

44:33.303 --> 44:33.637
He told everything
to the police.
