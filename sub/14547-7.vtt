Somewhere between
the senior slump

00:02.794 --> 00:03.753
and the Freshman 15

00:03.795 --> 00:04.796
there exists a window

00:04.838 --> 00:06.214
a window to travel outside

00:06.256 --> 00:07.924
your comfort zone,
and to try new things.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.010
For me, that meant
a house party two towns over

00:10.051 --> 00:12.637
thrown by some college kid
home on break.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.931
For Lisa, that meant
going to the house party

00:14.973 --> 00:18.184
in a bedsheet designed
to look like a toga.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.687
I...told you.

00:20.729 --> 00:24.774
Okay. So I guess it's not
required at all college parties.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.402
Or maybe these killas
just don't know what time it is.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.071
I think we should go.
I mean, everyone here can vote.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.448
'Half of them
can legally drink.'

00:31.489 --> 00:33.408
What are they gonna
want to talk to us about?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.994
Come on, guys. We are traveling
outside our comfort zones.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.203
We're meeting new people.

00:37.245 --> 00:42.042
Oh, my God!
I love that toga!

00:42.083 --> 00:45.170
You are hilarious!
I love you.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.379
I love you, too.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.673
- Let me show you to my friends.
- Oh.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.553
Yeah, I'm-I'm, I'm not
officially allowed to vote

00:53.595 --> 00:55.764
but I'm pretty sure
I'm a libertarian.

Kaitlyn and Kimantha

01:23.875 --> 01:26.377
wanted to eat Greek at Natalie's
and there's no Wi-Fi there.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.921
Why do you need
Wi-Fi to eat--

01:27.962 --> 01:29.422
I don't like being places
where I don't know

01:29.464 --> 01:30.965

01:31.007 --> 01:32.258
I like to see my "Likes"

01:32.300 --> 01:34.135
and when I can't,
I don't like it.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.720
Uh, I can't help but notice

01:35.762 --> 01:38.515
you've become very preoccupied
with your "Likes."

01:39.766 --> 01:41.309
I like "Likes."

01:41.351 --> 01:42.852
But you can't hug a "Like"

01:42.894 --> 01:44.479
and a "Like" won't
put its arm around you

01:44.521 --> 01:45.772

'Cause a "Like"
doesn't have arms.

- No, it does not.

- Okay?

03:30.168 --> 03:32.879
But it wasn't okay,
and something told Lisa

03:32.921 --> 03:35.298
that if she didn't make a move
her relationship with Malik

03:35.340 --> 03:38.760
would end up like

I really didn't like.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.350
What? Why?

03:45.391 --> 03:46.559
Because I didn't want
to seem like a hater

03:46.601 --> 03:47.936
even though I hate her.

Last night,
after our conversation

04:04.369 --> 04:06.329
called "It's Just Yogurt."

I don't want yogurt.
I want a boyfriend.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.458
No, but this is
for a boyfriend.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.294
See, they casually set you up
with an eligible bachelor

04:13.336 --> 04:15.797
and y'all two grab a yogurt,
and if you don't like him

04:15.838 --> 04:17.840
well, hey, at least you got
a yogurt out of it.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.594
But we have yogurt.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.304
I think the yogurt part
is throwing you.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.349
Honestly, it's not about yogurt.
You'll see.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.186
Oh, hey, Lisa.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.230

sports teams doing?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.593
They're fine, thank you.

And why do you think
your marriage failed?

05:07.390 --> 05:08.766
Excuse...excuse me?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.268
You married young, for love.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.477

Uh, I-I suppose
that's surmisable.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.110
And yet, it was
a huge disaster. Why?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.487
Who said it was a huge disaster?
Did Tessa say that?

05:21.529 --> 05:24.657
No.
But surmisable, right?

05:33.374 --> 05:36.169
from someone
who's been there, you know?

05:36.210 --> 05:38.463
This is a big decision and I
don't want to take it lightly.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.089
I wanna do my research.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.175
Okay, what big decision
are we talking about here?

05:42.216 --> 05:45.094
I've decided to ask
Malik to marry me.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.722
Is that slang for going
to the prom or something?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.057
No.

05:49.098 --> 05:52.060
That's slang for
being life partners

05:52.101 --> 05:54.520
for as long as
we both shall live..

05:54.562 --> 05:57.815
...and beyond, for all eternity,
in perpetuity

05:57.857 --> 05:59.484
throughout this universe
and any others.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.445
Okay. Well, I guess I just don't
see what the big rush is.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.280
You know, all eternity
isn't going anywhere.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.741
Yes, but Malik is.
We both are.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.410
We're going to college
next year and..

06:09.452 --> 06:10.953
...you should see
the way some of these

06:10.995 --> 06:13.289
college girls act,
Mr. Altman.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.209
They are all over his fine ass.
No, mm-mm.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.336
I need to lock this
whole thing down now

06:18.378 --> 06:20.254
while Malik is still
at his low introductory rate

06:20.296 --> 06:22.465
before his whole
situation skyrockets.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.760
Okay, uh..

06:25.802 --> 06:27.595
...I'm just spit-balling here

06:27.637 --> 06:32.975
but, uh, what if you put
his...fine ass on layaway?

06:33.017 --> 06:35.103
That was a metaphor,
Mr. Altman.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.481
Right.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.608
You sure I can't
get you some lemonade?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.531
Look, I don't
wanna overpromise

06:46.572 --> 06:48.866
but I am literally
a miracle worker.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.993
Right now, the Vatican
is trying to have me sainted.

Oh, my.
Do you hear that, Dalia?

06:53.663 --> 06:57.291

for more people than
eHarmony, Okay-Whatever

07:05.633 --> 07:07.885
is exactly what
you're looking for in a man

07:07.927 --> 07:10.138
and I guarantee I will
find you true love

07:10.179 --> 07:11.472
but read your contracts

07:11.514 --> 07:12.932
because true love
is not guaranteed.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.101
- I don't want true love.
- Even better.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.895
I just want a really cute boy
to rub in Tessa Altman's face.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.481
I don't know who that bitch is,
but I hate her already.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.776
He should be anywhere between
6'2" and 6'2 and a half.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.028
Brunette but
blond as a child.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.656
Strong cheekbones, with a weak
chin that quivers when he cries

07:28.698 --> 07:30.199
but he never cries.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.702
Overly arched eyebrows
are a plus.

07:32.743 --> 07:36.038
His relaxed face should look
like he's tasting a gross lemon.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.458
He should be cut,
in both senses of the word.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.462
Slight curve to my left,
if possible.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.756
- Devout Buddhist.
- Okay. I love it.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.176
You have given me
so much to work with.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.385
You're welcome.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.511
That's great.
What about you, darling?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.054
What are you looking
for in a man?

07:52.096 --> 07:54.432
Oh, I don't know.
Whatever you think is best.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.268
Well, what's best is whatever
your heart desires.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.770
So what does it desire?
Tell me.

07:59.812 --> 08:03.232
Um...Dalia had a good answer.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.109
- She did.
- Thanks, mommy.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.947
Um...well, I don't know.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.949
Just somebody good that
you think would be good.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.036
Oh, come on.
Let your imagination run wild.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.956
Okay.
He should be super nice.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.084
- Mm-hmm.
- Or mean, maybe.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.296
Why don't I help?
Do you want a guy with kids?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.548
If he has them,
if not, he shouldn't go out

08:27.590 --> 08:28.090
and get any on my account.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.721
- Religious?
- If he believes, I will.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.474
- If he doesn't, I won't.
- Wait, what?

08:36.516 --> 08:39.185
My man...I'm open to believe
in what he believes.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.187
- But he doesn't exist.
- That's okay.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.980
I don't want to put
any pressure on him.

08:44.273 --> 08:47.360
Okay. Alright.
I've seen this before.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.820
You, my dear,
are a little too preoccupied

08:49.862 --> 08:51.572
with pleasing others.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.950
That being the case, I have
the perfect person for you.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.826
[gasps]
Oh, goody!

08:55.868 --> 08:58.246
- It's you.
- Me?

08:58.287 --> 09:01.165
I want to set you up
on a date with yourself.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.751
I think you need
to get to know you

09:03.793 --> 09:06.754
so you can decide
what you want.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.381
Oh. Okay.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.008
So, take yourself out
for a yogurt

09:11.050 --> 09:12.468
and if you don't hit it off--

09:12.510 --> 09:14.470
At least I get
a yogurt out of it.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.430
Exactly!

09:16.472 --> 09:17.890
And just so we're clear,
this does count

09:17.932 --> 09:19.559
as one of the five matches
you've paid for.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.353
Okay.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.896
There are different
standards of beauty, sure

09:23.938 --> 09:26.774
but if you ask me, it's
imperfection that's alluring.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.192
Total symmetry is bland.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.236
And while it may be
valued above all else

09:30.278 --> 09:33.906
in a town like Chatswin,
to me, that girl over there

09:33.948 --> 09:36.951
looks like she just
rolled off an assembly line.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.037
The processed hair,
the synthetic tan

09:40.079 --> 09:43.291
face full of injectables...
blank stare.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.792
I didn't even have to look.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.586
I knew Mark was
talking about Dalia

09:46.627 --> 09:48.713
because he and I were
two sides of the same coin.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.800
In fact, we were the same side
of the same coin.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.260
Do you collect coins?

09:54.302 --> 09:55.720
- No.
- Neither do I.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.346
Oh, my God.
You're amazing.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.849
[instrumental music]

09:59.890 --> 10:01.684
(Lisa)
Making out with Mark
was effortless.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.811
We both tilted our heads
at the same time

10:03.853 --> 10:05.813
didn't go crazy
with the tongue.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.440
Kind of made me wonder
why I ever bothered

10:07.481 --> 10:09.984
making out with someone
so different than me.

10:10.026 --> 10:13.738
Like Ryan Shay,
who went crazy with the tongue.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.864
There, I said it.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.453
So, h-how are things at work?

10:20.494 --> 10:22.455
Oh, you know,
living just enough for the city.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.790
- Sho' nuff.
- "Sho' nuff?"

10:24.832 --> 10:27.835
I hope everyone
likes fig bickies.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.503
Okay, guys,
I'm...I'm gonna..

10:29.545 --> 10:31.547
I'm gonna cut right
to the chase.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.008
- I'm worried about Lisa.
- Join the club.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.635
Meet the captain of it.
Toot, toot!

10:35.676 --> 10:38.137
I feel a little bad
about going behind her back.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.349
But as a parent,
I know I would want to be told.

10:41.390 --> 10:44.852
- What is it? Alcohol?
- Hashish?

10:44.894 --> 10:46.771
- Has she been dexing?
- Robot tripping?

10:46.812 --> 10:48.397
She on the stove-top?
Chicken feed?

10:48.439 --> 10:51.317
- Did someone turn her out?
- W-what? No!

10:51.359 --> 10:53.819
No. None of that.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.446
[clears throat]

10:55.488 --> 10:56.781
She wants to marry Malik.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.823
[laughing]

10:57.865 --> 10:59.241
Is that all?

10:59.283 --> 11:01.077
To hell with tea.
Where's the champagne?

11:01.118 --> 11:03.079
- No, she's serious about it.
- As she should be.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.747
Malik's a catch.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.666
Yeah, and let's face it,
a little out of her league

11:06.707 --> 11:08.042
so if she can lock that down..

11:08.084 --> 11:09.168
And that's a big "if.."

11:09.210 --> 11:10.544
She should do it, right away.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.713
Okay, aren't you worried at all

11:12.755 --> 11:14.757
'that it'll be a disaster?'

11:14.799 --> 11:16.300
They're kids,
what could they possibly know

11:16.342 --> 11:17.593
about making a marriage work?

11:17.635 --> 11:20.137
Nothing.
But what is there to know?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.556
Sheila and I got married
at a young age and look at us.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.974
Wouldn't change it
for the world.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.393
Couldn't live without
each other.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.311
Well, we could.
But we wouldn't want to.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.313
But my heart would stop beating
the moment yours did.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.649
Whereas, in my case,
you know, the cardio helps.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.111
I swim, so...mine might
beat a little longer.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.571
- Anyway, back to your daughter.
- Darling?

11:37.613 --> 11:39.407
In time, I may even
learn to love again.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.825
[sighs]

11:40.866 --> 11:42.118
You know, for the sake
of the children.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.703
The children would
surely be grown.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.414
Maybe a taller man.
I don't know.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.750
Fair haired for a change
of pace, works in finance

11:49.792 --> 11:51.711
has a little summer place
on the island.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.672
His name is Keith.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.550
Are you seeing someone?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.094
You keep them guessing.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.846
That is the gravy
in the marriage pot pie.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.389
Oh! Are we having pot pie?

12:03.431 --> 12:04.724
It's a very simple recipe

12:04.765 --> 12:07.143
and I will be sure
to share it with Lisa.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.272
[indistinct chatter]

12:16.610 --> 12:17.987
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.449
- Oh, leave that, please.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.533
I thought you were
eating alone.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.826
I am.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.080
[sighs]

12:30.499 --> 12:31.876
This is ridiculous.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.216
[instrumental music]

12:41.510 --> 12:42.887
Is it?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.435
Yes.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.728
People are gonna think
I'm a crazy person

12:50.770 --> 12:52.438
having a conversation
with myself.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.565
Why do you worry so much
about what other people think?

12:54.607 --> 12:55.983
Who says I do?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.569
The person who knows
you best...me.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.820
I'm not sure I
like your company.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.822
I'm not sure
I like your outfit.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.115
What's wrong with my outfit?

13:03.157 --> 13:04.492
Steven bought this for me
in Nice.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.868
It's your least favorite color

13:05.910 --> 13:07.912
yet you wear it
all the time, anyway.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.206
- It was a gift.
- What about those earrings?

13:10.247 --> 13:11.874
They're too heavy and they hurt.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.626
Is there any part of you

13:13.667 --> 13:17.713
that isn't some calculated
piece of man bait?

13:17.755 --> 13:19.215
How dare you?

13:19.256 --> 13:20.633
I did not spend hours

13:20.674 --> 13:22.384
waxing my wherewithals
and ne'er-do-wells

13:22.426 --> 13:24.136
to be insulted by
the likes of you!

13:24.178 --> 13:26.806
You can't handle the truth.
Is that it?

13:26.847 --> 13:28.182
I can't handle you!

13:29.892 --> 13:32.228
And don't even think
about following me home.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.562
'I know where you live!'

13:33.604 --> 13:35.481
That woman is a total nightmare.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.240
Well, that was the worst date
ever. I hate me.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.951
Sorry, mommy.
My match was perfect.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.995
He wants to take me to Turks
and Caicos for Vesakha.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.872
Well, that's very nice, Dalia.
I'm happy for you.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.291
I'm just a little mad
at myself at the moment.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.252
Sounds like you were
a total bitch.

13:56.293 --> 14:00.840
I was! I accused myself of being
wrapped up in pleasing men.

14:00.881 --> 14:04.301
I said my entire identity
was nothing but a shiny jewel

14:04.343 --> 14:05.886
meant to capture a man's eye!

14:07.513 --> 14:09.348
I'll show me.

14:09.390 --> 14:13.185
I don't need these
man trapping fineries.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.063
Mommy, don't.
Please, mommy, stop.

14:16.105 --> 14:20.359
I am gonna give myself...
ow...a make under.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.820
- Stop!
- Dalia, I have to do this.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.113
Mommy, you don't know
what you're doing.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.531
These high heels
are coming off.

14:25.573 --> 14:29.118
Mommy.. Oh, my God.
Mommy, no. No, mommy, don't.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.369
[screaming]

14:30.411 --> 14:31.662
- Oh, my God!
- Mom!

14:31.704 --> 14:33.372
Look away!
My feet are hideous!

14:33.414 --> 14:35.624
They're deformed from years
of high heel wearing!

14:35.666 --> 14:38.544
- Mommy, I'm gonna throw up!
- Dalia, don't look!

14:38.586 --> 14:39.837
- 'Mommy!'
- No, look away!

14:39.879 --> 14:42.047
- That's disgusting!
- Don't look!

14:42.089 --> 14:43.382
- Mommy!
- I said don't...oh, oh! Oh!

14:43.424 --> 14:44.884
[thud]

14:44.925 --> 14:48.888
- 'Dalia, help.'
- Carmen, mommy fell!

14:50.472 --> 14:52.182
It was great dating someone

14:52.224 --> 14:54.351
who could literally
anticipate your next move.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.397
Do you need to use
the bathroom?

14:59.690 --> 15:00.357
I do need to use
the bathroom.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.155
But it could also be
a little...not great.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.324
Want a bite?

15:08.365 --> 15:11.577
We ordered the exact same thing,
so, no.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.497
I was kind of hoping
that you'd get some fries

15:15.539 --> 15:17.583
so I could have some.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.084
I was hoping the
same thing about you.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.717
Well, I'm afraid it's not
great news, Ms. Royce.

15:26.759 --> 15:31.096
You have the most severe case
of Barbie foot I've ever seen.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.016
- Is it hereditary?
- No, it's cultural.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.185
Mama had me in heels
before I could walk.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.898
[babbling]

15:40.940 --> 15:43.192
It's just the family way,
doctor.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.570
Oh, I get it. My family
likes to complain about food.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.113
I mean, I'm not deformed
because of it

15:48.155 --> 15:50.616
but I am unpleasant
to dine with.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.992
Oh, doctor.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.662
Will I ever be able
to walk in flats?

15:54.703 --> 15:56.288
No, you won't.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.623
'I would have to break
and reset'

15:57.665 --> 15:59.667
almost every bone in your foot.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.794
It's a very costly
and painful procedure.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.420
Oh, no.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.173
- But it is outpatient.
- I'll take two.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.302
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure, Mr. Altman.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.929
After our last conversation

16:11.971 --> 16:14.974
I was worried
I wouldn't be welcome, so..

16:15.015 --> 16:16.350
- What's this?
- Grilled cheese.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.397
I'm vegan now.
I thought you knew.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.107
But you used to love
grilled cheese.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.608
Didn't you once tell me
you'd be happy eating nothing

16:24.650 --> 16:26.402
but grilled cheese
for the rest of your life?

16:26.443 --> 16:28.988
And now you don't,
you don't eat it anymore.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.740
That's weird.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.576
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.954
I'm...I'm happy
to make you something else

16:36.996 --> 16:38.747
seeing that your
tastes have changed.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.249
Well, thank you.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.959
I guess we should
just both be glad

16:42.001 --> 16:44.837
you never signed a contract
stating you would only eat

16:44.878 --> 16:48.424
grilled cheese
for the rest of your life..

16:48.465 --> 16:49.800
...in perpetuity.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.635
Okay, I know an ambush
when I see one.

16:51.677 --> 16:55.139
Lisa, wait.
Just hear me out, okay?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.515
Like you said,
I've been there.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.851
I want you to learn
from my mistakes.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.602
When I was not much
older than you

17:00.644 --> 17:01.770
I thought I knew what I wanted.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.105
I thought I knew it all.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.483
But what I didn't know was..

17:06.525 --> 17:09.987
...how much I didn't know.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.657
You can't possibly know
what the future holds..

17:13.699 --> 17:15.242
...not at your age.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.621
What do you want me to say?

17:19.663 --> 17:21.498
I...I want you to say

17:21.540 --> 17:24.376
that you'll think about it
before you do anything rash.

17:24.418 --> 17:28.130
Okay.
I'll think about it.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.549
But, Mr. Altman,
just so you know

17:30.591 --> 17:32.926
I do still like
grilled cheese.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.386
I just make it
with vegan cheese.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.680
Okay.
Well, I think we both know

17:36.722 --> 17:38.599
that's not real cheese.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.977
It's like a million
miles from real cheese.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.189
Sex symbol, doting mom

17:45.230 --> 17:47.066
businesswoman, Chatswinite.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.485
When we strip away our labels,
strip away the ways

17:49.526 --> 17:51.737
in which we define ourselves,
what's left?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.280
Who are we at the core?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.948
For Dallas, the answer was..

17:56.658 --> 17:58.368
...a mousey brunette
with a limp.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.537
Hello.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.082
Sorry.
We don't have any spare change.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.460
Dalia, honey, it's me.
It's mommy.

18:07.711 --> 18:08.921
Oh, my God,
mommy, no.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.550
You look like
a New Yorker cartoon.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.718
Huh.

18:21.266 --> 18:25.145
Mommy, no.
You look so bad.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.939
I miss my old mommy.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.400
But your old mommy was only
interested in pleasing men.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.112
Therefore, she was a monster,
not a mommy.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.655
This is the new me.

18:34.696 --> 18:38.575
And my sweater may itch,
my face may be patchy

18:38.617 --> 18:42.663
my hair may be brittle,
but at least I'm happy.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.457
- You don't look happy.
- I'm miserable.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.585
But I guess that's just the
price I pay for being myself.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.921
But you're not being yourself.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.173
Yourself goes to bed
with a full face of makeup

18:53.215 --> 18:56.051
then reapplies lip gloss
in the middle of the night.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.388
Yourself got a splenectomy
just to hit your goal weight.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.015
And, sure,
yourself cares about looks

19:02.057 --> 19:04.810
but yourself also cares
about other stuff.

19:04.852 --> 19:05.894
Like what?

19:05.936 --> 19:07.396
Turns out, Dalia knew Dallas

19:07.437 --> 19:08.730
better than she knew herself.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.399
Yourself started
your own business

19:10.440 --> 19:13.026
the same year yourself
became a single mom.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.028
Yourself never doubted
yourself before

19:15.070 --> 19:17.114
so why is yourself
doubting yourself now?

19:18.740 --> 19:21.076
Yourself has been
a huge inspiration to me

19:21.118 --> 19:23.370
and if you think I'm great

19:23.412 --> 19:25.080
then you should take
a look at yourself.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.625
Except not...not right now.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.878
You look like something
Carmen snaked out of our drain.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.926
Okay, three-letter-word for..

19:44.308 --> 19:46.685
Hey..
W-where are you going?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.563
You're about to
break up with me

19:49.605 --> 19:50.814
which means
I'm just minutes away

19:50.856 --> 19:52.316
from breaking up with you.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.861
- We're too similar.
- We have all the same thoughts.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.156
"Duck Dynasty" is scripted.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.158
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.868
You should go.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.374
They say
to never judge a person

20:09.416 --> 20:10.834
until you've walked
a mile in their shoes.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.211
[sighing]

20:12.252 --> 20:14.171
But I would add
that if you're wearing

20:14.213 --> 20:17.007
the same shoes as the person
you're standing next to

20:17.049 --> 20:20.135
maybe it's time to broaden
your horizons.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.303
I thought that's what
you liked about him.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.473
I did...at first.

20:24.514 --> 20:28.477
And then I missed being with
someone who challenged me

20:28.518 --> 20:31.063
and made me try
stupid things

20:31.104 --> 20:33.732
and always ordered
French fries.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.192
[chuckles]

20:35.234 --> 20:36.693
Like Ryan.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.362
Guess there's a reason
opposites attract.

20:38.403 --> 20:41.615
- Exactly, like you and Malik.
- Ebony and Ivory.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.450
Yeah.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.869
- You guys are a great couple.
- We are.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.624
[exhales]
Malik is "Sasha Fierce"
to my "Hova"

20:50.666 --> 20:54.503
and with that said..

20:54.544 --> 20:56.463
...I want you to be
my Kelly Rowland.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.634
You lost me.

21:00.676 --> 21:04.304
I...decided..

21:04.346 --> 21:06.932
...to ask Malik
to marry me.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.770
- Wow!
- Yeah.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.482
Why?

21:15.524 --> 21:18.735
Because I liked it,
so I'm gonna put a ring on it.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.864
What do you think?

21:22.906 --> 21:24.700
- Ah!
- Yeah!

21:24.741 --> 21:26.576
At that moment,
the only thing I

21:26.618 --> 21:30.038
really could think was
"Thanks a lot, Beyonce."
