WEBVTT

01:00.518 --> 01:02.918
So, what's new, Eddie?
Anything exciting?

01:03.754 --> 01:06.689
Yeah, we just got those new Nike
SasQuatch drivers into the store,

01:06.791 --> 01:08.156
so that's been kind of cool.

01:08.258 --> 01:11.921
Let me rephrase the question.
You been crushing any pussy?

01:12.729 --> 01:15.129
No, Dad,
I haven't been crushing any pussy.

01:15.232 --> 01:16.790
Seriously, who you booming?

01:16.900 --> 01:18.629
Dad, seriously,
I'm not "booming" anybody,

01:18.735 --> 01:20.669
I'm just kind of dating a little right now.

01:20.770 --> 01:22.795
I don't get you.
You refuse to get married,

01:22.906 --> 01:26.034
yet you don't really enjoy the fruits
of bachelor life.

01:26.142 --> 01:29.111
It's like you're living
in a purgatory over here.

01:29.211 --> 01:31.008
Dad, I don't refuse to get married.

01:31.113 --> 01:33.707
It's just I wanna do it
with the right person, okay?

01:33.816 --> 01:35.909
I'm sorry to ride you, pal.
I just want you to be happy.

01:36.018 --> 01:38.452
I hate you to be alone
on Valentine's Day.

01:38.586 --> 01:40.281
I won't be. I'm going to a wedding.

01:40.388 --> 01:41.650
Oh. Now you're talking.

01:41.756 --> 01:43.951
Weddings are a great place
to meet women.

01:44.058 --> 01:45.753
Who's getting married?

01:45.860 --> 01:46.918
Jodi.

01:48.263 --> 01:49.321
Jodi?

01:49.831 --> 01:51.389
What are you...

01:51.900 --> 01:52.867
What?

01:52.967 --> 01:54.662
- Are you serious?
- Dad. Come on.

01:54.801 --> 01:58.464
- Eddie, don't do this to yourself.
- We're still friends.

01:58.572 --> 02:00.972
I'm just saying, watching
your ex-fiancée walk down the aisle

02:01.074 --> 02:03.804
on Valentine's Day might sting a little.

02:04.378 --> 02:06.369
No. We're way past that.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.074
Really. I mean, if anything,
it's gonna be cathartic.

02:09.181 --> 02:10.376
Give me a little closure.

02:10.483 --> 02:14.180
I think it's flat-out wrong,
but maybe I'm just old-fashioned.

02:14.287 --> 02:16.721
Come on, skip the wedding.
You and me, we'll head to Vegas.

02:16.822 --> 02:19.655
Maybe we'll get lucky and tag-team
a couple of broads.

02:19.759 --> 02:21.727
Yeah, I have to say the idea
of a tag team

02:21.827 --> 02:24.660
with my 77-year-old father
is extremely tempting,

02:24.763 --> 02:27.163
but I already RSVP'd, so...
I appreciate the offer.

02:27.265 --> 02:28.232
Come on, come on.

02:35.607 --> 02:37.234
Hey, can I get a beer, please?

02:37.342 --> 02:40.709
- And I will get a Cosmopolitan.
- No problem.

02:40.811 --> 02:44.110
Cosmopolitan?
Isn't that sort of a female-type drink?

02:44.215 --> 02:46.706
Oh yeah. Yeah.
Tammy turned me on to them.

02:46.817 --> 02:49.479
And I pretty much drink
what she drinks, so...

02:49.587 --> 02:50.986
Oh. Really?

02:51.088 --> 02:53.852
Yeah. Happy wife, happy life.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.491
That's a good one.
"Happy wife, happy life." I like that.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.257
- Rhymes. Must be true.
- Yeah. Thank you.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.760
Wow. Look at Jodi.
She looks great, huh?

03:05.969 --> 03:07.061
Yeah, she looks really good.

03:07.170 --> 03:09.195
And she's got the kind of looks
that are gonna last, you know?

03:09.304 --> 03:10.566
Look at her mom.

03:10.672 --> 03:12.299
Oh, what a cougar.

03:14.443 --> 03:16.274
Some good genes there.

03:16.578 --> 03:18.011
Hey. Come on.

03:18.580 --> 03:21.947
Look, you had five years to pull
the trigger with Jodi, okay?

03:22.050 --> 03:24.712
And if I recall, you had plenty
of reasons for calling it off.

03:24.819 --> 03:27.253
Yeah. I know. I'm just trying
to remember what they were.

03:27.355 --> 03:29.755
God, there was a million of them.

03:30.424 --> 03:34.588
"She doesn't like my fantasy football
league. She never shares her food.

03:34.695 --> 03:36.458
"She doesn't try anything new."

03:36.564 --> 03:38.532
Man, what are you...
That's not my voice.

03:38.633 --> 03:41.124
That's you. That's exactly you.
That's spot-on you.

03:41.234 --> 03:42.792
I don't sound like an Italian mouse.

03:43.336 --> 03:44.303
Little bit.

03:44.404 --> 03:45.996
I do not-a talk-a like this.

03:46.106 --> 03:49.940
Oh, yeah? Okay, remember this one?
"She hates-a <i>Caddyshack-a."</i>

03:50.043 --> 03:52.443
Yeah, and you know why
she hates-a <i>Caddyshack?</i>

03:52.579 --> 03:54.843
'Cause she said that
the gopher looked too fake.

03:54.980 --> 03:56.242
Come on, that would bother you.

03:56.348 --> 03:57.713
Oh, totally. Totally.

03:57.816 --> 04:00.341
Throw away a chance at happiness
because the gopher looks fake.

04:00.452 --> 04:02.352
Come on, man.
You've never been married.

04:02.454 --> 04:03.512
You're 40 years old.

04:03.622 --> 04:06.523
Eddie, at some point you're just gonna
have to close your eyes and jump.

04:06.625 --> 04:09.150
I did it. I'm the happiest guy I know.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.524
- Hey, Eddie.
- Oh, hey.

04:11.629 --> 04:13.221
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you doing?

04:13.331 --> 04:14.992
Good, good. Are you sad?

04:15.099 --> 04:16.088
No.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.724
Oh, good. Good.

04:18.435 --> 04:20.767
Mac, come on, honey, we gotta go.
Everyone's already at our table.

04:20.872 --> 04:22.271
- Lead the way, gorgeous.
- Is that for me?

04:22.373 --> 04:25.137
- No, that's his.
- Oh. Well, it's mine now.

04:27.744 --> 04:29.177
What table you at, Eddie?

04:29.279 --> 04:32.840
I am at table 34.

04:32.949 --> 04:35.179
- Oh, too bad. We're at 11.
- We're at 11.

04:35.285 --> 04:36.752
- Okay. See you later.
- All right.

04:36.853 --> 04:38.013
- Save me a dance.
- Okay.

04:38.121 --> 04:39.145
- Don't forget.
- I won't.

04:39.255 --> 04:41.314
- Mac, come on.
- Bye. Gotta go.

04:52.034 --> 04:53.592
Cheers!

04:55.370 --> 04:56.928
And that was that!

05:08.316 --> 05:09.715
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

05:09.817 --> 05:12.445
Hey, are you running this whole thing?

05:12.686 --> 05:14.381
Oh, sure.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.353
Walk up to the first homo you see

05:16.457 --> 05:18.823
and assume he's
the wedding coordinator, right? Nice.

05:18.926 --> 05:21.394
- No, no. I didn't mean that.
- Nice stereotype, buddy, nice.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.793
Did I hear someone
say "wedding coordinator"?

05:23.897 --> 05:25.330
That would be <i>moi.</i>

05:25.431 --> 05:26.898
So, how can I help you?

05:26.899 --> 05:27.297
So, how can I help you?

05:33.639 --> 05:37.234
I think there's been a mistake, 'cause
I'm at table 34, but that's the kids' table.

05:37.343 --> 05:41.279
Oh, oh. That's not the kids' table.
That's the singles' table. Enjoy.

05:49.354 --> 05:51.413
Wife couldn't make it, huh?

05:51.990 --> 05:53.218
No wife.

05:53.859 --> 05:55.292
Oh. Divorced?

05:57.361 --> 05:58.350
No.

05:58.629 --> 05:59.994
Girlfriend?

06:01.365 --> 06:03.333
Kind of in-between right now.

06:03.434 --> 06:06.528
Sort of playing the field and
keeping my options open, you know?

06:06.637 --> 06:08.229
Hey, mister.

06:08.339 --> 06:10.034
- What?
- Are you gay?

06:11.040 --> 06:12.974
- No.
- Yes! You owe me 10 bucks.

06:13.076 --> 06:15.544
Hold on, hold on. Are you bi?

06:16.479 --> 06:18.174
No. No, I'm not bi.

06:18.281 --> 06:20.374
See? It's a tie. We both lose.

06:20.483 --> 06:22.917
Are you like a widow or something?

06:23.420 --> 06:25.888
Yeah. I'm a widow. That's... Yeah.

06:25.988 --> 06:28.422
- Sorry.
- He's full of it. He's gay.

06:28.891 --> 06:30.483
No. I'm not gay.

06:30.692 --> 06:33.490
- Let's play five-in-five, then.
- What is that?

06:33.595 --> 06:35.927
It's where I ask you five questions
in five seconds.

06:36.031 --> 06:38.124
If you're telling the truth,
then you shouldn't have to think.

06:38.233 --> 06:40.064
Yeah. I don't wanna play your game.
Sorry.

06:40.168 --> 06:41.760
- Quick. How'd your wife die?
- Murdered.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.063
- How?
- Ice pick.

06:43.171 --> 06:44.331
- They get the guy?
- Yeah.

06:44.439 --> 06:45.906
- What was his name?
- Ronald.

06:46.007 --> 06:47.497
Brad Pitt, Russell Crowe. Who's hotter?

06:47.608 --> 06:48.734
Brad Pitt.

06:48.943 --> 06:50.240
- What? I thought you...
- Yeah, we got you.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.938
No, I thought you meant
who's hotter career-wise.

06:53.047 --> 06:54.378
You're totally busted.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.915
- Gay.
- Gay.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.506
You're gay.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.108
<i>And I just want you all to know that</i>

07:00.954 --> 07:03.616
<i>Jodi is the only woman I've ever loved.</i>

07:04.291 --> 07:09.194
<i>And I wanna thank her for letting me</i>
<i>into her fairytale life.</i>

07:12.598 --> 07:17.399
<i>And that's not to say I didn't have to</i>
<i>kiss a few frogs before I met my prince.</i>

07:18.103 --> 07:20.867
Cantrow! Did you hear that?

07:20.973 --> 07:26.343
<i>But seriously, Michael has been</i>
<i>the answer to all my prayers.</i>

07:26.444 --> 07:31.313
<i>And quite frankly, he's the only guy</i>
<i>my father ever approved of.</i>

07:32.717 --> 07:35.379
<i>And that's because he's</i>
<i>the first guy she ever went out with</i>

07:35.487 --> 07:37.887
<i>who wasn't a total asshole.</i>

07:40.624 --> 07:43.593
<i>All right, all right, okay.</i>
<i>Look, thank you all for coming.</i>

07:43.694 --> 07:45.321
<i>We're gonna have some fun</i>
<i>today, right?</i>

08:37.410 --> 08:40.244
Stop him, he's got my purse!
Somebody stop him!

08:40.380 --> 08:42.746
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

08:42.849 --> 08:44.749
Fuck off, man!
This has nothing to do with you!

08:44.851 --> 08:46.341
Calm down, buddy, give me the purse.

08:46.452 --> 08:50.149
Back off, man! I swear to God,
I'll cut your fucking head off!

08:50.256 --> 08:52.121
- Give me the...
- I will snap you!

08:52.225 --> 08:57.561
No, man, that's mine. It's mine!
Hey, man, man, it's mine. It's mine!

08:57.663 --> 08:59.290
It's mine!

09:03.035 --> 09:04.332
Shit.

09:04.436 --> 09:05.698
Shit!

09:05.837 --> 09:07.862
Oh, God, are you okay?

09:07.973 --> 09:09.463
No, it stings. He Maced me.

09:09.575 --> 09:11.543
It's just my perfume.

09:11.642 --> 09:13.075
Shit, I can't believe this!

09:13.177 --> 09:16.305
I've got everything in there.
My credit card, my wallet.

09:16.414 --> 09:19.781
Everything is in that bag.
My license, my keys,

09:19.884 --> 09:22.045
my life.

09:22.587 --> 09:24.384
Yeah, that guy, he's like a freak.

09:24.488 --> 09:27.184
I mean, I just... I tried to stop him, but...

09:27.290 --> 09:28.655
Sorry. I almost had him.

09:28.758 --> 09:31.090
No, no, it's not your fault.

09:32.963 --> 09:36.524
I should have, like, punched him
or something. I'm sorry.

09:39.836 --> 09:44.034
Thank you.
It was really cool of you to get involved.

09:51.647 --> 09:54.844
- Here. Let me help you with this stuff.
- Oh, thank you.

09:58.519 --> 10:00.783
Oh. I'm sorry. I don't wanna...

10:00.888 --> 10:03.254
I don't know what the protocol there is.

10:03.358 --> 10:05.826
It's okay. I got it. No problem.

10:05.927 --> 10:08.225
Okay. Nice undergarment there.
So, there you go.

10:08.329 --> 10:09.523
So, you live around here?

10:09.631 --> 10:13.897
Yes, I do. Yeah, I do.
I actually live a couple blocks down.

10:14.001 --> 10:17.061
- Over by Bay City Sports?
- Bay City Sports? I...

10:17.170 --> 10:21.334
Yeah, a big sports... Sort of sporting
goods emporium, over on Van Ness.

10:21.441 --> 10:23.966
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I know that.
- I actually own the place, so...

10:24.077 --> 10:26.637
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

10:26.779 --> 10:29.680
- That's great. Oh, this is me.
- That's you? Okay.

10:30.683 --> 10:32.412
I don't have any money.
He took my wallet.

10:32.518 --> 10:33.780
Wait a minute. Here. I got it.

10:33.886 --> 10:35.945
Oh, no. I wasn't saying it to...
You've done enough. Really.

10:36.055 --> 10:38.751
No. Here. Please. Please.
I got a five-spot. Here you go.

10:38.858 --> 10:41.884
Go ahead. Take it. I got like hundreds
of dollars in the bank, so I'm good.

10:41.993 --> 10:45.360
- I can't take it, then.
- No, I'm kidding. I do fine.

10:45.463 --> 10:48.694
I mean, I'm not rich, I'm comfortable.
I'm good. Go ahead. Get on the thing.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.859
- Got it.
- All right.

10:52.003 --> 10:53.197
- Take it easy.
- Thank you.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.771
All right.

10:54.873 --> 10:57.398
Hey, what's your name?

10:57.508 --> 10:58.566
Lila!

10:58.676 --> 11:02.578
Lila, I'm Eddie! Eddie... Eddie Cantrow!

11:02.680 --> 11:03.738
Okay!

11:05.115 --> 11:06.207
Shit.

11:16.359 --> 11:18.224
Oh, yeah. This is your girl, Eddie.

11:18.327 --> 11:21.819
I've always said you can tell a lot
about a woman by her panties.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.455
When have you ever said that?

11:23.566 --> 11:26.535
I've said it like a mantra.
You just don't pay attention.

11:26.635 --> 11:27.602
So, did you get her digits?

11:27.703 --> 11:29.068
No, I didn't get her digits.

11:29.171 --> 11:31.264
The girl had just gotten mugged.
I wasn't gonna hit on her.

11:31.373 --> 11:36.333
Wait a second. She's hot, friendly,
it's Valentine's Day, she's all alone...

11:36.445 --> 11:39.972
She has David Bowie, your all-time
favorite musician, pasted on her undies.

11:40.082 --> 11:41.344
And you don't think to ask her out?

11:41.482 --> 11:43.347
It was... A lot was going on.

11:43.451 --> 11:46.716
I mean, I had just gotten sprayed
in the eye by a very sting-y perfume.

11:46.821 --> 11:47.981
I was disoriented. I was...

11:48.089 --> 11:51.388
And it never occurred to you
to chase the trolley down the street,

11:51.492 --> 11:54.518
waving her underwear
and calling out her name?

11:54.628 --> 11:57.563
No! I mean, look,
this girl was incredibly gorgeous.

11:57.664 --> 11:59.757
There's no way in hell she's single.

11:59.866 --> 12:02.733
I'm sure she's got, like, a dot-com
billionaire boyfriend.

12:02.836 --> 12:04.565
A billionaire
who makes her do the wash

12:04.671 --> 12:06.434
at a laundromat on Valentine's Day.

12:06.539 --> 12:10.168
Come on, Eddie! She was available.
You wimped out.

12:11.144 --> 12:12.839
Oh, that's my wife.

12:13.112 --> 12:14.204
Okay.

12:16.148 --> 12:17.479
Hey, honey.

12:17.683 --> 12:18.741
Yeah.

12:19.718 --> 12:22.209
Okay, sure, you got it. Right away.

12:22.321 --> 12:24.881
All right, guys. I'm on husband duty.

12:25.224 --> 12:27.158
Aunt Flo just arrived at our house.

12:27.258 --> 12:28.452
Who's Aunt Flo?

12:28.559 --> 12:31.050
Tammy just got her period,
so gotta pick her up some Maxibons.

12:31.162 --> 12:34.689
Is there anything that she asks you to
do that you don't jump to attention for?

12:34.799 --> 12:38.758
No. Why? I wanna make her happy.
That's why I grew out the bangs.

12:40.104 --> 12:42.072
Sorry you let that girl go, Eddie.
Sounded like a keeper.

12:42.172 --> 12:44.003
- Thank you, makes me feel better.
- You're welcome.

12:44.107 --> 12:45.165
He speaketh the truth.

12:45.275 --> 12:49.371
All you had to do was ask her out
for coffee or a goddamn piece of pie.

12:49.479 --> 12:52.243
Oh, pie. Yeah, pie really would've
clinched the deal, Dad.

12:52.349 --> 12:54.977
I'm just saying, when you
happen on ass-floss like these,

12:55.085 --> 12:56.416
you don't let them get away.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.114
I'm late for a root canal. Be good.

13:04.326 --> 13:07.159
All right, Ralphie, let's go.

13:07.263 --> 13:09.197
Shit. Eddie, what am I doing wrong?

13:09.298 --> 13:12.290
All right. First of all, don't ever swing
at the first pitch. You gotta be patient.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.994
- But the ball was right down the middle.
- It was a little high and inside.

13:15.103 --> 13:17.264
Hey, pussydick, can you break away
for nine holes?

13:17.372 --> 13:18.634
You know what?
I'm in the middle of something, Dad.

13:18.740 --> 13:20.731
Listen, everybody wants
to hit homers, right?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.776
But the fact is,
a walk's as good as a hit.

13:22.877 --> 13:23.678
- It is?
- Yeah.

13:23.978 --> 13:25.673
That's the worst piece of advice
I ever heard.

13:25.780 --> 13:27.611
- Swing at the next one, slugger.
- No, wait.

13:27.714 --> 13:29.079
You want me to swing or wait?

13:29.183 --> 13:31.515
Listen to me, I'm older than him. Swing!

13:31.618 --> 13:32.744
- Wait.
- Swing!

13:32.853 --> 13:35.378
No, Dad, now you're screwing him up.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.457
Oh, my God.

13:38.559 --> 13:40.254
- Dad, that's her.
- Who?

13:40.360 --> 13:42.920
That's the girl I was telling you
about, Lila. You gotta get out of here.

13:43.029 --> 13:46.863
- Go. Go, go, go.
- Relax. I'm not gonna blow your cover.

13:47.633 --> 13:50.363
But it's nice to put a face to the panties.

13:50.469 --> 13:51.527
Where did you get those?

13:51.671 --> 13:55.903
Will you calm down? They're not for me.
I was just gonna bring them by the club!

13:56.008 --> 13:58.203
What?
A guy can't brag about his own kid?

13:58.310 --> 14:01.802
- No, Dad. Dad.
- Give me. Give me.

14:01.913 --> 14:04.245
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:05.650 --> 14:08.676
I was in the neighborhood
looking for a fleece.

14:08.820 --> 14:09.980
What do you think?

14:10.088 --> 14:11.646
Excellent taste.

14:12.256 --> 14:13.723
That's my dad.

14:13.958 --> 14:15.858
Hi, Dad.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.625
Nice to meet you, Lila.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.189
How do you know my name?

14:21.298 --> 14:23.027
Okay, cat's out of the bag.

14:23.834 --> 14:25.665
My son found your panties
on the sidewalk,

14:25.769 --> 14:28.567
and we've been talking
about you all week.

14:28.671 --> 14:31.367
Eddie, give her back
her undies, will you?

14:33.309 --> 14:36.710
Here you go.
I was watching those for you,

14:36.813 --> 14:41.147
hoping you'd come in and claim them.
It worked out.

14:41.251 --> 14:43.082
- Okay.
- We're good now.

14:43.452 --> 14:45.511
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:45.921 --> 14:47.980
Okay. My work here is done.

14:49.191 --> 14:50.488
Let me go.

14:51.793 --> 14:52.782
He's so cute.

14:52.895 --> 14:54.886
Yeah, he is. He's a cutie.

14:56.398 --> 14:58.389
- So, what do you think?
- Well, what are you looking to do?

14:58.499 --> 15:02.401
You looking to just go hiking,
or bopping around town, or...

15:02.503 --> 15:04.300
Little bit of both, probably.

15:04.405 --> 15:06.930
Okay, well, they're both
quick-dry material, which is good,

15:07.041 --> 15:08.599
'cause it wicks away the sweat
from the surface,

15:08.709 --> 15:09.971
allows it to evaporate quickly.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.477
But if I was gonna go with one,
I'd probably go with the Patagonia,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.604
'cause it's 100% recycled material.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.911
Hey, you a pie fan?

15:20.787 --> 15:23.688
A fan of pie? Do you like pie? The...
Pie? Food? Pie.

15:23.790 --> 15:27.920
Oh, pie. Like apple pie, and...
Yeah, I love pie.

15:29.061 --> 15:30.551
Get out of town.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.423
So you're an environmental researcher.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.924
Why do you sound so surprised?

15:36.035 --> 15:39.835
No, it's just, I mean, you know,
you don't really look like

15:39.939 --> 15:42.567
the prototypical scientist type.

15:42.674 --> 15:45.768
Well, it's not really that scientific.
It's more, you know...

15:45.877 --> 15:48.812
- It's just researching.
- Right. I know. Just research.

15:48.913 --> 15:50.278
Well, it is.

15:51.349 --> 15:53.817
Well, I'm sure you make it sound
much simpler than it is, but...

15:53.918 --> 15:56.853
For us knuckleheads who, you know,
sell baseball gloves...

15:56.955 --> 15:59.116
No, you're not a knucklehead.

16:00.023 --> 16:01.217
Eddie...

16:02.793 --> 16:04.693
Can I be honest with you?

16:04.795 --> 16:06.126
Yeah, sure.

16:07.597 --> 16:11.795
I didn't really need that fleece
that I bought today.

16:12.469 --> 16:15.029
I came in the store today to see you.

16:15.638 --> 16:16.798
Really?

16:18.307 --> 16:19.865
- Yeah.
- Oh, cool.

16:21.477 --> 16:23.502
I mean, if you wanna return the fleece,
it's fine, seriously.

16:23.612 --> 16:25.842
Oh, no, Eddie, I don't.
I don't wanna return it.

16:25.948 --> 16:27.415
Okay, but just know
that that's okay, too.

16:27.516 --> 16:29.609
- No, I love it.
- I mean, aside from all of this other...

16:29.718 --> 16:33.415
Eddie, I think it's perfect for me.

17:42.319 --> 17:43.343
You're not mad?

17:43.453 --> 17:45.284
Of course I'm not mad.

17:45.388 --> 17:48.255
I don't want you to do anything
you're not comfortable with. Come on.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.486
I know it's silly. I mean,
it's not like I'm a virgin or anything.

17:51.594 --> 17:54.654
Lila, you don't owe me
any explanations, okay? Really.

17:54.764 --> 17:57.756
I know, but I just want you
to understand where I'm coming from.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.129
I just...

17:59.234 --> 18:02.499
I've seen how sleeping together
too soon can ruin a relationship,

18:02.604 --> 18:05.402
and I don't wanna risk what we have.

18:06.108 --> 18:08.906
'Cause what we have
is really, really nice.

18:09.478 --> 18:12.538
Last time I checked,
we're not in a race, right?

18:12.915 --> 18:13.973
Cool.

18:21.355 --> 18:23.186
- All right.
- All right.

18:23.691 --> 18:25.386
- Good night.
- Night.

18:25.793 --> 18:27.158
Sleep well.

18:27.495 --> 18:28.792
I will.

18:36.603 --> 18:39.436
<i>Eddie, phone call, Line 3. It's Lila.</i>

18:41.808 --> 18:43.776
Hey, baby, how you doing?

18:45.978 --> 18:47.411
What's wrong?

18:47.646 --> 18:50.672
How long do they want you
to live in Rotterdam?

18:50.850 --> 18:52.579
I don't know,
it depends on the restructuring.

18:52.685 --> 18:55.381
- I mean, at least two years.
- Two years?

18:55.488 --> 18:56.819
Maybe more.

19:01.059 --> 19:02.356
Two years?

19:04.629 --> 19:06.028
Why Germany?

19:06.731 --> 19:07.959
Holland.

19:09.634 --> 19:12.000
Can't you just tell them,
"I won't do it. I can't do it.

19:12.103 --> 19:14.503
"I wanna be a researcher, but I'm not,
you know, I'm not gonna..."

19:14.605 --> 19:17.267
Eddie, this is my career.
I can't say that.

19:17.374 --> 19:20.036
I understand that,
but can't you, like, just say, you know...

19:20.144 --> 19:21.805
Isn't there somebody else
who wants to go?

19:21.912 --> 19:24.676
No, it's either me or this other
researcher, and he's married.

19:24.781 --> 19:25.770
So what?

19:25.883 --> 19:28.943
So, they don't move married people.
It's policy.

19:33.523 --> 19:35.514
So what are the negatives?

19:36.192 --> 19:38.353
Well, for one thing,
I've only known her for six weeks.

19:38.461 --> 19:39.928
That's half a summer, Eddie.

19:40.029 --> 19:42.520
I proposed to your mother
after three dates.

19:42.632 --> 19:45.192
She gave me 18
of the best years of my life.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.928
You were engaged to Jodi for five years.
What good did that do you?

19:48.036 --> 19:49.731
All right, yeah,
but there's other stuff, too.

19:49.838 --> 19:51.032
Such as?

19:52.107 --> 19:53.734
She doesn't have
a great sense of humor.

19:53.842 --> 19:55.207
Are you out of your mind?

19:55.310 --> 19:57.278
Funny's a male gene, you idiot.

19:57.379 --> 20:00.041
Haven't you ever noticed,
whenever you see a really funny girl,

20:00.147 --> 20:01.375
she's a little mannish?

20:01.482 --> 20:06.078
Think about it. Lily Tomlin,
Evelyn DeGeneres, Rosie O'Donnell...

20:06.187 --> 20:08.212
Oh, I got a thing
for Ellen DeGeneres, though.

20:08.322 --> 20:10.051
I do. I have to admit it.

20:10.157 --> 20:13.320
I think she's great. I think she's hot.
Great ass.

20:13.826 --> 20:14.815
Check it out.

20:14.928 --> 20:17.192
All right, you know what?
Forget that stuff, okay? She's wonderful.

20:17.297 --> 20:19.765
She's an incredible girl.
There's no better. Okay?

20:19.866 --> 20:23.632
Still, just the idea of marriage.
It's just so permanent. You know?

20:23.736 --> 20:25.033
It's like...

20:25.138 --> 20:26.162
It's like at the end of the day,

20:26.272 --> 20:29.332
I'm choosing between Lila
and all the other women in the world.

20:29.441 --> 20:32.410
You've barely nailed
any of the other women in the world.

20:32.511 --> 20:35.537
You haven't crushed more than three
pussies since you broke off with Jodi.

20:35.647 --> 20:39.174
Dad, what is this obsession
with pussy-crushing counting?

20:39.284 --> 20:41.844
I really, I just...
I'm not comfortable with that term.

20:41.954 --> 20:44.047
Sorry. Snatch. Whatever.

20:45.523 --> 20:47.821
- Who do you think you are?
- Huh?

20:48.526 --> 20:51.086
Just who the hell
do you think you are, Eddie, huh?

20:51.195 --> 20:55.154
Sitting here, trying to come up
with reasons not to marry this girl?

20:55.266 --> 20:56.358
You should be thanking God

20:56.467 --> 20:59.732
that a woman this fantastic
would even consider you.

21:00.036 --> 21:01.901
Now, unless you wanna be
the 75-year-old dad

21:02.005 --> 21:02.994
at the Little League game,

21:03.106 --> 21:07.065
I suggest you get on with your life,
'cause that's what this is, Eddie. It's life!

21:07.177 --> 21:09.475
Life, Eddie. Goes like that.

21:17.386 --> 21:20.844
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.938
Congratulations, buddy.
You hit a home run.

21:43.478 --> 21:44.877
Can you believe it? I did it!

21:44.978 --> 21:48.880
I finally took the plunge.
And you know what? It feels great.

21:49.750 --> 21:50.944
I told you it would.

21:51.051 --> 21:53.815
Thank you. Thank you for talking
some sense into me, man.

21:53.920 --> 21:57.014
I mean, look at this! Look at this.
I'm married to this amazing girl.

21:57.124 --> 21:58.318
I got the next three weeks off.

21:58.425 --> 22:00.450
- We're road-tripping it down to Cabo.
- Cabo.

22:00.559 --> 22:01.548
That's it.

22:01.661 --> 22:04.095
- You're in the club.
- I'm in the club.

22:04.196 --> 22:07.757
Hey, when you get down to the hotel,
ask for Uncle Tito.

22:07.867 --> 22:10.097
And give him this as a thank you.

22:10.202 --> 22:12.329
Okay, look, remind me again,
who's Uncle Tito?

22:12.438 --> 22:13.530
He's a friend of mine.

22:13.639 --> 22:14.901
You know. I always take care of him.

22:15.006 --> 22:17.099
He gives me a big discount
when I go down there.

22:17.208 --> 22:18.505
He knows you're coming.

22:18.610 --> 22:20.202
That's awesome, man. Thank you.

22:20.312 --> 22:23.110
Honey! My mom finally arrived!

22:23.214 --> 22:24.977
Oh, great! Where is she?

22:25.850 --> 22:28.011
There's my tiger!

22:30.321 --> 22:32.687
Give me a hug.

22:34.692 --> 22:37.627
I am so sorry I missed the ceremony.

22:38.696 --> 22:41.631
Look at her, so beautiful.

22:41.732 --> 22:45.190
That's the same dress
I wore on my wedding day.

22:46.169 --> 22:47.431
Same designer?

22:47.537 --> 22:49.801
No, it's the very same dress.

23:08.323 --> 23:10.621
<i>Spread out now, Rosie doctor</i>

23:10.726 --> 23:13.593
<i>Come cut loose her mama's reins</i>

23:14.663 --> 23:17.291
<i>You know playin' blind man's bluff</i>

23:17.398 --> 23:19.992
<i>is a little baby's game</i>

23:20.968 --> 23:23.368
<i>You pick up Little Dynamite</i>

23:23.471 --> 23:26.531
<i>I'm gonna pick up Little Gun</i>

23:26.640 --> 23:29.370
<i>And together we're gonna go out tonight</i>

23:29.477 --> 23:32.344
<i>And make that highway run</i>

23:33.813 --> 23:35.337
You got a pretty good voice there.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.439
Why, thank you, soul mate.

23:37.550 --> 23:38.517
I'm glad you like it,

23:38.618 --> 23:42.247
'cause you're gonna be hearing
a lot of it for the next 40 or 50 years.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.683
Forty or fifty years.

23:45.491 --> 23:47.288
Hey, you know what I was thinking
when we get down there?

23:47.393 --> 23:49.520
We should go out sport fishing.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.858
I've always wanted to catch a marlin,
put it up in the store.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.263
- No, baby, I can't do that.
- Why not?

23:55.367 --> 23:58.928
Because I can't do boats.
I get really, really seasick.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.198
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.866
That's okay. There's a lot of other
fun stuff we can do down there.

24:03.975 --> 24:04.942
Yeah.

24:05.042 --> 24:07.033
I definitely wanna get out of the hotel
a couple of days.

24:07.145 --> 24:09.136
Maybe get a burro, you know?

24:09.247 --> 24:11.374
A Mexican burro? Donkey?

24:11.482 --> 24:14.110
Go up into the mountains?
You know, just have a little adventure.

24:14.218 --> 24:15.685
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:16.420 --> 24:20.823
I kind of thought it would be nice
to just relax on the beach, you know?

24:22.192 --> 24:24.592
I mean, remember, honey,
this is a Third World country.

24:24.694 --> 24:26.594
It can be really dangerous.

24:26.696 --> 24:30.063
Yeah. Well, I mean, you know.
It's Cabo.

24:30.166 --> 24:31.633
Yeah, exactly.

24:33.035 --> 24:35.026
<i>Come on, shake your body, baby</i>
<i>Do that conga</i>

24:35.137 --> 24:37.298
<i>I know you can't control yourself</i>
<i>any longer</i>

24:37.406 --> 24:39.271
<i>Come on, shake your body, baby</i>
<i>Do that conga</i>

24:39.375 --> 24:41.935
<i>I know you can't control yourself</i>
<i>any longer</i>

24:45.747 --> 24:48.011
<i>Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly</i>

24:48.116 --> 24:50.141
<i>The DJ's spinning</i>
<i>I said, my my</i>

24:50.251 --> 24:54.278
<i>Flash is fast, Flash is cool</i>
<i>François sez fas, Flashé no do</i>

24:54.389 --> 24:59.053
<i>And you don't stop</i>
<i>Sure shot, go out to the parking lot</i>

25:00.461 --> 25:06.058
<i>And I'm ready to take a chance again</i>

25:06.867 --> 25:12.772
<i>Ready to put my love</i>
<i>on the line with you</i>

25:13.540 --> 25:15.474
<i>I'll tell you what I want</i>
<i>What I really, really want</i>

25:15.575 --> 25:17.975
<i>So, tell me what you want</i>
<i>What you really, really want</i>

25:18.077 --> 25:20.170
<i>I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna</i>

25:20.279 --> 25:22.907

<i>And they shimmy</i>

25:31.623 --> 25:32.783
Hey, baby? Honey?

25:32.891 --> 25:35.951
Why don't we turn off the radio
for a little bit, and just sort of...

25:36.061 --> 25:38.552
Sort of vibe out on the wind

25:39.798 --> 25:41.493
and chill out a little?

25:42.434 --> 25:44.299
I've got a better idea.

25:45.103 --> 25:47.867
- Why don't we go find a room and fuck?
- Okay.

25:52.309 --> 25:54.072
- You like that, Eddie?
- Yeah.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.579
- Yeah, you like that, don't you?
- I do.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.239
Tell me how much you like it.

26:00.317 --> 26:03.150
- I like it.
- Then tell me how much you like it!

26:03.253 --> 26:04.811
I like it a lot!

26:05.355 --> 26:08.847
- Do you like that?
- Whoa, yeah. Yeah, I like that.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.482
How about that?

26:10.593 --> 26:14.757
Ow! No, no, no, no. Oh, no, no. No, no.
No, no, don't like that.

26:14.864 --> 26:18.061
Now I know what to do
when Eddie's a bad boy.

26:18.567 --> 26:21.900
Do you think maybe we can switch up
the position a little bit?

26:22.004 --> 26:23.938
'Cause I'm starting to get cramped here.

26:24.039 --> 26:25.597
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

26:25.707 --> 26:28.198
You wanna do the Inverted Corkscrew?

26:28.877 --> 26:30.538
Remind me, again, what's that?

26:30.646 --> 26:34.377
It's just like the Swedish Helicopter,
except you spin me.

26:34.882 --> 26:38.682
Okay. You know what?
I don't... I'm not a big helicopter guy.

26:38.786 --> 26:41.346
No, never mind.
Just Jackhammer me, Eddie.

26:41.455 --> 26:43.116
Okay, I... What's a...

26:43.224 --> 26:45.089
Jackhammer me, Eddie!
Jackhammer me!

26:45.192 --> 26:47.456
- What is a...
- Jackhammer me! Jackhammer me!

26:47.561 --> 26:50.394
Hey, hey, I got an idea. You know what?
Guess what. Guess what.

26:50.497 --> 26:53.625
Why don't we just, you know,
do, like, a little missionary position

26:53.733 --> 26:55.223
for a little bit?

26:55.335 --> 26:56.700
What's that?

26:57.671 --> 26:59.070
Missionary position. You know.

26:59.172 --> 27:02.107
It's like, you know,
when I'm on top of you,

27:02.207 --> 27:05.608
just a regular guy on top of a girl?
Yeah?

27:05.711 --> 27:07.110
- Okay.
- Yeah?

27:07.746 --> 27:10.476
Can you Pile Drive me
from that position?

27:15.154 --> 27:16.985
That was so beautiful.

27:33.337 --> 27:36.238
Could you not make those little circles?

27:37.007 --> 27:39.976
Just... My skin's kind of
sensitive right now.

27:42.312 --> 27:45.611
Well, what if I made little squares?

27:48.317 --> 27:50.148
I don't think any shapes...

27:50.252 --> 27:53.153
I don't wanna do any shapes
right now, okay?

27:56.359 --> 28:00.318
Is my Eddie Bear gonna be grouchy
for the next 40 to 50 years?

28:01.630 --> 28:04.121
I'm not being grouchy. Honey.

28:05.066 --> 28:06.658
Where you going?

28:07.168 --> 28:08.396
Pee-pee.

28:19.847 --> 28:22.247
That wasn't what you think it was!

28:24.218 --> 28:26.083
What? I didn't hear anything.

28:26.186 --> 28:27.414
Oh, good.

28:28.022 --> 28:30.320
'Cause I just queefed, big-time.

28:35.662 --> 28:36.720
Okay.

28:45.605 --> 28:48.301
Mr. Cantrow's awfully quiet
this morning.

28:49.608 --> 28:52.600
Nah, I'm always quiet
in the morning, sort of.

28:52.711 --> 28:57.444
I take a little while to get up to steam.

28:58.850 --> 29:02.286
Will you hold my hand while we eat?
I really like that.

29:04.321 --> 29:06.881
Hold your hand? Of course, of course.

29:19.569 --> 29:21.161
Baby. Baby, look.

29:22.305 --> 29:24.899
They're so cute. That's us in 10 years.

29:25.775 --> 29:29.267
Ten? I don't know about that.
I mean, it seems like a little...

29:29.379 --> 29:31.643
I hope it's more than 10 years.

29:32.848 --> 29:35.249
You're probably right.
I'm really bad at math.

29:35.250 --> 29:35.807
You're probably right.
I'm really bad at math.

29:37.152 --> 29:39.746
- Eddie, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

29:42.791 --> 29:44.224
Last night,

29:45.794 --> 29:49.958
you didn't think I was too hairy
down there, did you?

29:50.064 --> 29:53.261
I know a lot of women shave completely,
but I don't like that.

29:53.367 --> 29:55.267
You know, it makes me feel
like a little girl.

29:55.369 --> 29:56.996
But if you want, I could trim it.

29:57.105 --> 30:00.040
And that way you'd be able
to see my kitty ring better.

30:01.476 --> 30:05.879
I don't think so. I mean, I think...
No, that's a good... I could see it.

30:05.979 --> 30:08.743
- Was good visibility on it.
- Okay.

30:19.125 --> 30:20.114
You okay?

30:20.226 --> 30:22.160
- Oh, God.
- You all right?

30:22.628 --> 30:24.459
There's the apple juice out the nose.

30:24.563 --> 30:29.830
It's just this stupid deviated septum that
I have, and it just... Everything just...

30:29.935 --> 30:31.425
You've got a deviated septum?

30:31.537 --> 30:33.869
There was a kid at my camp
who had a deviated septum.

30:33.972 --> 30:36.566
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. He used to snore like a pig.

30:36.674 --> 30:37.698
- Well, I don't snore.
- Good.

30:37.809 --> 30:42.178
But I do have a lot of fluids coming
out of my nose, more than I'd like.

30:42.514 --> 30:44.607
We just have to keep you
away from liquids, huh?

30:44.716 --> 30:48.015
Baby, look at them. They are so cute.

30:52.222 --> 30:53.746
They are adorable.

30:54.424 --> 30:56.551
<i>Chicken in the bread pan</i>
<i>pickin' out dough</i>

30:57.494 --> 31:00.429
<i>"Granny, does your dog bite?"</i>
<i>"No, child, no"</i>

31:45.840 --> 31:49.867
This is amazing!
It's even better than the brochure.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.671
Baby, look at this!

31:53.346 --> 31:54.836
Not too shabby.

31:57.050 --> 31:58.074
Eddie?

31:58.184 --> 31:59.242
Yeah?

32:00.987 --> 32:02.921
I need to say something.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.923
I've never been married before,

32:08.026 --> 32:11.723
and I've been wanting everything
to be so perfect that

32:11.830 --> 32:14.424
I think I've been acting a little off.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.630
- Oh... No!
- Yes.

32:18.736 --> 32:19.725
Really, I have.

32:19.871 --> 32:23.272
I've been trying so hard to act like
I'm all comfortable with everything

32:23.374 --> 32:26.741
that I think I've gone too far
the other way.

32:28.212 --> 32:29.804
Well, maybe a little.

32:29.914 --> 32:32.178
I mean, but you know what?
I'm nervous, too.

32:32.283 --> 32:35.218
I mean, here we are.
We, you know... We're married.

32:35.318 --> 32:38.082
I've never been married before.
We're both new at this.

32:38.188 --> 32:39.382
I'm glad you said something.

32:39.489 --> 32:43.084
Good. Well, what do you say
we just reset?

32:43.193 --> 32:45.957
I like that. Yeah. Let's just... Reset.

32:46.329 --> 32:48.194
Press the TiVo button.

32:51.333 --> 32:52.561
- Look at this!
- Oh, my God!

32:52.668 --> 32:57.230
<i>El Mariachi!</i> I love it.
This is the real Mexico, baby!

33:01.844 --> 33:02.833
Here you go.

33:02.944 --> 33:07.677
<i>Por favor,</i> stay close this week with us.
It's our honeymoon.

33:08.149 --> 33:11.414
Oh, my God.
They have some major happy hour.

33:11.519 --> 33:14.386
Eddie Bear, you go check us in.
I'll get a snack.

33:14.489 --> 33:15.581
Okay.

33:15.690 --> 33:19.524
Do me a favor, play for her. Go.
Yes, serenade her.

33:23.363 --> 33:26.230
Hey look, it's that fruit from the wedding.

33:27.367 --> 33:29.232
Hey. What are you guys doing here?

33:29.336 --> 33:31.770
I don't know.
We're on vacation with our parents.

33:31.872 --> 33:33.237
You look disappointed to see us.

33:33.339 --> 33:35.637
What? Did you think
this was a gays-only resort?

33:35.741 --> 33:39.734
For your information,
the hot blond over there, she's with me.

33:39.845 --> 33:41.244
That's who I'm gonna
be sleeping with tonight, so...

33:41.347 --> 33:43.144
I'll give you this. It's impressive.

33:43.249 --> 33:45.274
- Yeah.
- How does he do it?

33:45.384 --> 33:48.319
Does he tuck his balls under
or does he tape them up real high?

33:48.420 --> 33:50.752
You know what? Why don't you take
your little Human Genome Project

33:50.855 --> 33:51.947
and hit the road?

33:52.057 --> 33:54.082
You homophobic hobbits.

33:54.192 --> 33:55.318
Punks.

33:57.662 --> 34:00.392
Do you think you could tell me
where I could find Uncle Tito?

34:00.498 --> 34:02.625
Yes. May I ask who is inquiring?

34:02.734 --> 34:05.464
Yeah, my name's Eddie Cantrow,
and I'm a friend of a friend of his.

34:05.569 --> 34:07.537
I'm supposed to give him something.

34:07.638 --> 34:09.663
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but he no longer works here.

34:09.773 --> 34:12.799
He's actually in jail
serving six to ten years.

34:13.409 --> 34:14.809
He was caught running cock fights,

34:14.911 --> 34:18.074
and I'm not speaking about
the kind with roosters.

34:19.181 --> 34:20.376
Really?

34:20.483 --> 34:22.542
Screw off! I'm joking, man!

34:23.219 --> 34:25.949
Come on! I am Uncle Tito!

34:26.054 --> 34:27.147
Pleasure to meet you.

34:27.255 --> 34:28.484
You're Uncle Tito! Okay.

34:28.591 --> 34:30.956
You should have seen
the look on your face.

34:31.060 --> 34:32.721
Did you bring the present from Mac?

34:32.829 --> 34:36.128
Yes, I did. Yes.
Here... Yeah, here you go.

34:36.231 --> 34:40.565
It's funny, I... Uncle Tito. I was thinking
of, like, an older, gray-haired...

34:40.668 --> 34:41.931
- Yes.
- I don't know why.

34:42.036 --> 34:44.835
- You like the hair?
- I like it. You got a whole...

34:51.911 --> 34:56.542
Pardon me.
I was wanting to know if we could...

34:59.553 --> 35:02.989
Here is the adult sex tape you ordered,
<i>Señor</i> Cantrow.

35:05.425 --> 35:07.188
I will bill it to your room.

35:07.293 --> 35:09.887
Would you like me
to bring up any more?

35:11.331 --> 35:12.798
No. Thank you.

35:13.299 --> 35:16.359
<i>Perfecto!</i>
You will have a fun night tonight.

35:19.238 --> 35:21.433
Baby, you've gotta try this Mind Eraser.

35:21.540 --> 35:24.031
The guy put in, like,
four shots of Patrón.

35:24.143 --> 35:26.668
You are even more sexier
than Mac described.

35:26.779 --> 35:28.041
Thank you.

35:28.147 --> 35:30.274
I was not talking to you,
I was talking to him.

35:30.382 --> 35:35.183
Screw off! I'm joking, man!
Come on. You are unbelievably hot.

35:35.286 --> 35:37.914
By the way, please put your jewelry
inside the safe.

35:38.022 --> 35:40.081
I cannot tell you how many
honeymooners come down here

35:40.191 --> 35:41.658
and they lose their rings on the beach.

35:41.759 --> 35:44.125
- It's very sad.
- Okay, thanks for the tip.

35:44.228 --> 35:48.130
Also, Mac's a pal, so I want you to know
I totally set you guys up.

35:48.232 --> 35:49.893
I got you the honeymoon suite.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.763
Hey, all right, thank you!

35:52.669 --> 35:54.227
This is amazing!

35:55.205 --> 35:57.036
How beautiful is this?

35:57.541 --> 35:59.702
Man. Look at that view.

36:02.379 --> 36:03.812
Eddie, think fast!

36:04.613 --> 36:06.410
Honey, come on! Babe!

36:06.849 --> 36:08.248
You could take out an eye
with that thing.

36:08.350 --> 36:10.818
Oh, hush, I didn't come close.

36:11.387 --> 36:13.048
Man, look at this place.

36:13.155 --> 36:15.453
Jeez. Wonder how much
the room costs.

36:15.558 --> 36:19.392
Oh, honey, stop worrying about money.
This is our honeymoon.

36:19.494 --> 36:22.895
We're gonna remember this
for the next 40 to 50 years.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.260
You're right.
I'm thinking like a single guy.

36:26.367 --> 36:28.801
I gotta remember
we're a two-income family now.

36:28.903 --> 36:31.303
Really? You have a second job?

36:31.406 --> 36:33.874
No, I mean my salary, your salary.

36:33.974 --> 36:36.465
- My salary?
- Yeah. Oh, what?

36:36.577 --> 36:38.841
You wanna keep our finances
separate now?

36:38.946 --> 36:41.141
Honey, I'm a volunteer.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.649
Oh, yeah?
Well, how much do volunteers make?

36:45.686 --> 36:47.449
A volunteer is a volunteer.

36:47.554 --> 36:51.422
I help raise money for my
environmental group. I told you this.

36:55.261 --> 36:58.788
So they force volunteers
to move to Rotterdam?

36:59.332 --> 37:00.959
Unmarried volunteers?

37:01.067 --> 37:02.898
They don't force them.

37:03.002 --> 37:06.597
But if you wanna get in good with
the company, you gotta play the game.

37:06.705 --> 37:10.334
You told me
you're an environmental researcher.

37:11.109 --> 37:12.440
Yeah, I am.

37:13.178 --> 37:16.579
Unless you don't count wading in
the freezing-cold San Francisco Bay

37:16.681 --> 37:19.946
for three months, measuring PCBs
and getting stung by jellyfish,

37:20.050 --> 37:22.518
which I won't even tell you what
they had to do to take the pain away.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.451
They had to pee on me.

37:25.022 --> 37:28.253
You get stung by a jellyfish, that makes
you an environmental researcher?

37:28.359 --> 37:31.556
You know what, Eddie? I love my job
and I don't have to defend it to you.

37:31.662 --> 37:34.364
Job? No, no, no. I don't think
you're allowed to call it a job.

37:34.364 --> 37:34.659
Job? No, no, no. I don't think
you're allowed to call it a job.

37:34.764 --> 37:36.664
Oh, really?
And what am I supposed to call it?

37:36.766 --> 37:37.960
A hobby?

37:38.067 --> 37:40.729
- A hobby?
- A hobby. You get paid for a job.

37:40.837 --> 37:42.532
- Says who?
- Says the dictionary.

37:42.639 --> 37:44.971
Well, who reads the dictionary?
Not everybody.

37:45.074 --> 37:47.975
Yeah, apparently not! A "job" is a word.
There is a definition for it!

37:48.077 --> 37:50.170
You married me for my money.

37:50.412 --> 37:53.040
What? No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't turn this around.

37:53.148 --> 37:56.811
What's next? You're gonna steal
my purse, like my last boyfriend did?

37:56.919 --> 37:58.784
Your last boyfriend stole your purse?

37:58.887 --> 38:00.616
Duh! You were there!

38:01.990 --> 38:05.824
That was your boyfriend?
That maniac mugger guy?

38:05.927 --> 38:07.087
That was my ex-boyfriend.

38:07.195 --> 38:09.493
The crazy guy on the bike
was your ex-boyfriend?

38:09.597 --> 38:11.656
- Yes.
- And you didn't tell me this. Why?

38:11.766 --> 38:14.064
Why would I?
You and I were complete strangers.

38:14.168 --> 38:16.864
So... And why was he
stealing your purse?

38:17.505 --> 38:20.133
Because he owed me money,
so I took his wallet.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.832
And I'm not about to leave it
in my apartment,

38:21.942 --> 38:23.307
because then he'd break in
and steal it back.

38:23.410 --> 38:26.504
So I kept it in my purse,
along with his keys and his cell phone.

38:26.613 --> 38:29.343
And let me tell you something else
about my little "hobby."

38:29.449 --> 38:32.282
One day, our kids are gonna
inhabitate this Earth.

38:32.385 --> 38:33.613
And I'm just trying to make sure

38:33.720 --> 38:35.551
that there's some aqua life
left for when they do!

38:35.654 --> 38:37.383
- That's not a word.
- What's not a word?

38:37.489 --> 38:38.956
"Inhabitate." Not a word.

38:39.058 --> 38:42.425
Oh, really? Why don't you look it up
in your little "dictionary,"

38:42.528 --> 38:45.895
and why don't you look up "shitfuck"
while you're at it?

38:45.998 --> 38:47.488
I will look it up with "shitfuck"!

38:47.600 --> 38:51.092
And guess what?
I won't find "inhabitate" or "shitfuck"!

38:52.537 --> 38:53.902
Fuck! Shit!

39:03.615 --> 39:04.673
Lila?

39:25.034 --> 39:26.126
Lila?

39:45.220 --> 39:46.209
This is stupid.

39:46.321 --> 39:47.879
Excuse me.

39:48.089 --> 39:49.556
A little help?

39:50.090 --> 39:51.887
Sorry, I dropped my camera.

39:58.265 --> 39:59.994
Doesn't look broken.

40:00.467 --> 40:03.027
No, don't throw it. I'll be right down.

40:03.137 --> 40:04.195
Okay.

40:06.039 --> 40:07.802
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

40:08.608 --> 40:10.633
I didn't mean to sneak up on you.
I was...

40:10.743 --> 40:12.506
Oh, yeah. No problem.

40:13.379 --> 40:16.371
Was that you this morning
at Reception?

40:16.983 --> 40:18.041
Yeah.

40:18.851 --> 40:20.648
That wasn't what it looked like.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.413
Just looked like
you were renting a videotape.

40:22.521 --> 40:25.888
No, no, I know, but I wasn't.
I mean, that wasn't... I wasn't.

40:25.991 --> 40:29.085
You don't have to explain to me.
All right? Boys will be boys.

40:29.194 --> 40:33.426
I got a cousin who drives a truck with
a bumper sticker that says "Born Hard."

40:33.532 --> 40:35.864
Right. Okay, but I'm not that guy.
I mean, I'm not...

40:35.966 --> 40:37.160
Miranda!

40:38.035 --> 40:41.732
We're getting ready to play Parcheesi!
Please come upstairs.

40:41.906 --> 40:43.771
I'm coming, I'm coming.

40:45.509 --> 40:47.739
- That's my cousin.
- That's your cousin?

40:47.845 --> 40:49.710
- We're down here for a family reunion.
- Oh, yeah?

40:49.814 --> 40:53.910
Yeah. My aunt and uncle renew
their wedding vows every year.

40:54.017 --> 40:57.248
It's a little hokey, but they're still in love
after 42 years, God bless them.

40:57.354 --> 40:59.117
- So we go along with it.
- That's nice.

40:59.222 --> 41:02.680
Yeah. What about you? What's got you
standing out here mumbling to yourself?

41:02.792 --> 41:05.056
Running low on your medication?

41:05.160 --> 41:06.627
Was I mumbling?

41:06.762 --> 41:08.286
- Yeah.
- Audibly?

41:08.397 --> 41:11.958
Miranda!
We are all ready to play Parcheesi.

41:12.601 --> 41:13.932
I'm coming!

41:15.571 --> 41:17.937
All right, okay.
Hope your camera's okay.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.530
Happy mumbling.

41:26.948 --> 41:27.937
Hey.

41:28.049 --> 41:30.017
I am so sorry.

41:30.118 --> 41:32.382
- No, no, no. Honey, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

41:32.487 --> 41:33.454
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

41:33.588 --> 41:38.924
Look, really. Look, first of all,
I love that you love the fishes, okay?

41:39.426 --> 41:43.328
And I think it's great that you wanna
clean up the ocean, okay?

41:43.597 --> 41:44.723
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:44.831 --> 41:47.061
Yeah, I'm just, you know...

41:47.167 --> 41:48.634
- Eddie.
- I got all worked up.

41:48.735 --> 41:50.600
- But you were right, Eddie.
- No, no.

41:50.703 --> 41:53.467
Yes. They should have been paying me
a long time ago.

41:53.572 --> 41:54.800
Whatever. Whatever.

41:54.907 --> 41:57.171
No, but really, I mean...

41:57.309 --> 42:00.767
How am I ever gonna get out of debt
if I keep letting them do this to me?

42:00.880 --> 42:03.678
- How are you gonna what?
- Get out of debt.

42:03.783 --> 42:06.183
You're in debt? What kind of debt?

42:06.851 --> 42:09.945
You know, the kind where you owe
a lot of money to people.

42:10.054 --> 42:11.681
How much money?

42:11.790 --> 42:15.783
Well, it's not so bad. I mean,
ever since I stopped doing the blow,

42:15.894 --> 42:18.920
it's down to about 26 K.

42:20.231 --> 42:22.290
You had a... You snorted...

42:22.833 --> 42:24.824
You had a cocaine problem?

42:25.202 --> 42:27.295
That's how I got
the deviated septum, remember?

42:27.404 --> 42:29.736
You said you had a deviated septum.
You didn't say that you had a...

42:29.840 --> 42:30.829
You know...

42:30.941 --> 42:32.272
Snorting the cocaine.

42:32.376 --> 42:34.173
Yeah, but that's how you get
a deviated septum.

42:34.278 --> 42:36.007
I didn't... Okay.

42:36.112 --> 42:40.412
That kid at camp, he didn't have
a blow problem, you know. He was...

42:40.516 --> 42:42.006
Well, how do you know?

42:42.118 --> 42:44.985
Because he was eight
and he was my bunkmate.

42:45.087 --> 42:47.112
I mean, you know,
I would have been aware...

42:47.223 --> 42:49.248
Tell me a little bit more
about this, though.

42:49.358 --> 42:53.317
You know, it's a chapter of my life
that I'm not particularly proud of.

42:53.428 --> 42:55.157
Right, right.

42:55.263 --> 42:56.890
But you know what?

42:57.299 --> 43:01.895
If I had to do it all over again,
I wouldn't change a darn thing.

43:02.003 --> 43:04.471
Because it made me who I am today.

43:04.573 --> 43:07.133
And do you know
who I am today, Eddie?

43:08.342 --> 43:10.071
No. Who are you?

43:10.711 --> 43:12.645
I'm Mrs. Edmund Cantrow.

43:13.814 --> 43:14.974
Edward.

43:15.282 --> 43:17.477
"Edward"? You didn't tell me that!

43:17.585 --> 43:19.485
I... Yeah, Edward.

43:19.587 --> 43:21.646
Well, Mr. Cantrow.

43:21.754 --> 43:25.713
Are there any other dark, dirty secrets
that I should know about?

43:30.029 --> 43:32.122
Cock me. Cock me.

43:33.333 --> 43:35.460
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

43:35.568 --> 43:37.433
- You bet.
- Yeah.

43:37.536 --> 43:39.003
Tell me how much you like it.

43:39.104 --> 43:40.662
I still like it a lot.

43:40.772 --> 43:42.797
Yeah. Hit me.

43:43.475 --> 43:44.464
What?

43:44.576 --> 43:45.736
Hit me!

43:46.111 --> 43:47.942
I don't wanna hit you.

43:48.213 --> 43:51.376
Come on, Eddie. I've been a bad girl.
Now hit me!

43:52.617 --> 43:55.085
You've been fine.
I don't wanna hit you, Lila, really.

43:55.186 --> 43:57.586
What's the matter, Eddie,
you a little girl?

43:57.688 --> 43:59.315
- You a little girl?
- No.

43:59.423 --> 44:02.324
- What, love? You got a little pussy?
- What? No!

44:02.426 --> 44:05.862
- A pussy! Do you have a pussy?
- No, I don't have a pussy!

44:05.963 --> 44:07.362
Well, what are you, a faggot, Eddie?

44:07.464 --> 44:09.125
- Are you a faggot?
- I'm not a faggot!

44:09.232 --> 44:11.757
Well, then, slap me! Slap me like this!

44:11.868 --> 44:14.302
That's right!

44:14.404 --> 44:17.601
What's the matter? I thought little girls
liked getting their nipples pinched.

44:17.707 --> 44:18.799
Don't you...

44:18.909 --> 44:22.106
Yeah! Oh, I love it! Like it rough!

44:22.211 --> 44:26.944
Yes! Yes, Eddie, yes! Cock me!

44:27.316 --> 44:30.183
Cock me! Cock me, Eddie!

44:30.286 --> 44:32.652
I think I am cocking you!

44:34.490 --> 44:37.789
Fuck me like a black guy, Eddie!
Come on!

44:42.530 --> 44:45.363
No! You're not doing it!

45:06.286 --> 45:08.686
Here, put some of this on my back.

45:11.490 --> 45:13.549
- This is mineral oil.
- Yeah.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.385
No, you need sunblock down here.

45:16.495 --> 45:19.464
No, you gotta use oil
if you wanna get savage.

45:21.033 --> 45:23.263
Babe, I'm telling you,
the sun's really strong down here.

45:23.368 --> 45:25.632
You need like a 30 or a 35. I got some.

45:25.737 --> 45:27.671
Are you becoming a control freak?

45:27.772 --> 45:31.970
I mean, first the thing about having
to tip the maid every day, and now this?

45:32.077 --> 45:35.843
Forget about it, Eddie. I'll just do it
myself if it's such a problem.

45:35.947 --> 45:38.482
I'm just saying
the sun's really different down here.

45:38.482 --> 45:38.971
I'm just saying
the sun's really different down here.

45:39.083 --> 45:41.074
The sun is the sun, Eddie.

46:15.117 --> 46:16.141
Honey!

46:16.251 --> 46:18.651
Oh, Grouchy Marx, calm down.

46:25.693 --> 46:27.627
Hey, look. He really is with that babe.

46:27.728 --> 46:29.457
Man, she is banging.

46:29.797 --> 46:34.029
That means he was telling the truth
about his wife getting ice-picked.

46:34.168 --> 46:35.760
That's messed up.

46:43.576 --> 46:45.373
Eddie, make them go away.

46:45.478 --> 46:47.275
Thank you, no.

46:47.380 --> 46:49.507
- Not now.
- Thank you. We're okay.

46:49.616 --> 46:52.881
- We don't want any. Thank you, though.
- Give them money. Give them money.

46:52.985 --> 46:56.477
Okay. Here you go. Here you go.
Thank you, but we're fine.

46:56.588 --> 46:59.819
We're just gonna take a little snoozelito.
We snooze, huh?

46:59.925 --> 47:01.916
No, no, no, no. No.

47:02.027 --> 47:05.258
You stop. Stop. No?

47:10.868 --> 47:12.699
It's not my fault.

47:12.804 --> 47:15.204
It's the stupid Mexican ozone!

47:15.306 --> 47:17.365
No. The Mexican ozone
isn't stupid, Lila.

47:17.475 --> 47:19.306
You just needed to wear
some sunscreen.

47:19.410 --> 47:21.708
I was trying to get a tan.

47:21.813 --> 47:24.111
No, you were trying to get "savage."

47:24.214 --> 47:26.079
Whose side are you on, Eddie?

47:26.183 --> 47:29.983
- What? What sides are there?
- Mine or the ozone's? Choose one!

47:30.754 --> 47:32.415
I'm on your side, all right?
Just calm down.

47:32.522 --> 47:35.616
Now look, I'm gonna put a little
of this aloe on your back, okay?

47:35.726 --> 47:37.250
Should make you feel better.

47:38.060 --> 47:39.652
You fucking cunt!

47:41.230 --> 47:42.197
Or not.

47:42.431 --> 47:43.420
<i>Hello?</i>

47:43.532 --> 47:45.932
Hey, Pop, it's me.
Listen, is this a good time?

47:46.035 --> 47:48.697
I'm in Vegas. Flew out for the weekend.

47:49.772 --> 47:52.468
Here, I want you to say hi to somebody.

47:53.942 --> 47:56.137
Hi, Eddie, this is Patty!

47:56.244 --> 47:59.907
Yeah, I met your father playing keno.
What a hot ticket.

48:00.215 --> 48:03.480
Hey, I heard you got married.
Congratulations.

48:03.585 --> 48:05.177
<i>Your father says she's amazing.</i>

48:05.286 --> 48:07.277
Not really. Can I talk to my dad?

48:07.488 --> 48:08.750
<i>All right.</i>

48:08.856 --> 48:10.255
<i>What's up? You okay, kid?</i>

48:10.357 --> 48:13.019
No, I'm not okay.
Dad, I got big, big problems here.

48:13.127 --> 48:15.823
I think Lila might be...
I think she might be a little off.

48:19.700 --> 48:22.225
Kitty ring? So, let me get this straight.

48:22.335 --> 48:25.736
You think your wife's a nutcase
because on your honeymoon,

48:25.838 --> 48:28.602
in a tropical paradise,
she's singing a lot,

48:28.708 --> 48:30.835
<i>wanting to have sex around the clock,</i>

48:30.943 --> 48:33.605
<i>and, accidentally,</i>
<i>she got a little too much sun?</i>

48:33.713 --> 48:36.011
Well, yeah, but it's a lot worse
than it sounds.

48:36.115 --> 48:38.345
Now listen to me,
and listen to me good!

48:38.450 --> 48:41.783
When your wife on her honeymoon
asks you to cock her,

48:41.887 --> 48:44.151
you cock her good, God damn it!

48:57.301 --> 49:00.293
- <i>Señor</i> Eddie, are you finished?
- Yeah. Thanks, Tito.

49:00.404 --> 49:02.463
Where is your lovely wife this evening?

49:02.573 --> 49:06.065
She got a little too much sun,
so she decided to crash out early.

49:06.177 --> 49:09.943
Are you sure it was the sun
that made her tired, and not you?

49:11.181 --> 49:12.239
You.

49:12.982 --> 49:14.643
- Tito!
- Yes, <i>señorita.</i>

49:14.751 --> 49:17.311
All right, I want another round,
but make it Flytails this time.

49:17.420 --> 49:18.387
No problem.

49:18.488 --> 49:19.546
Hey.

49:20.423 --> 49:22.186
Hey! What are you doing
down here at the bar?

49:22.292 --> 49:23.782
VCR break down?

49:24.493 --> 49:26.893
I was starting to chafe. So...

49:26.995 --> 49:28.826
Well, that's the way it goes.

49:28.931 --> 49:30.523
- You're Miranda, right?
- I am.

49:30.632 --> 49:31.929
I'm Eddie.

49:32.034 --> 49:35.561
- Nice to meet you, officially.
- Nice to meet you, too.

49:35.671 --> 49:37.104
What's a Flytail?

49:37.206 --> 49:40.073
I've got no idea,
but it's got tequila and a cool name,

49:40.174 --> 49:42.404
so I thought I'd give it a whirl.

49:42.510 --> 49:44.273
I like your thinking.

49:45.246 --> 49:47.305
You know who figured out
how to do it right?

49:47.415 --> 49:50.748
The people who live in the spots
where the rest of us vacation.

49:50.852 --> 49:53.548
Oh, yeah. You mean
like those perma-vacationers.

49:53.653 --> 49:54.984
- Yeah.
- Though, I don't know.

49:55.088 --> 49:56.612
You think they're really having
that good a time?

49:56.723 --> 49:57.747
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Really?

49:57.858 --> 49:59.655
- Oh, of course.
- Really? I don't know.

49:59.759 --> 50:02.489
I mean, I always feel like those people,
like, must be running from something.

50:02.596 --> 50:04.359
They're running from their boring lives.

50:04.464 --> 50:07.365
You know, most people get two or three
weeks of vacation to have fun.

50:07.467 --> 50:10.061
These people, man,
they party all year round.

50:10.169 --> 50:12.228
Yeah. Where are you from?

50:12.338 --> 50:14.636
- Oxford, Mississippi.
- Really?

50:15.507 --> 50:16.496
You don't have an accent.

50:16.609 --> 50:18.167
- Excuse me?
- Yeah?

50:18.711 --> 50:20.975
Are you here on your honeymoon?

50:21.480 --> 50:22.970
Actually, I am.

50:23.715 --> 50:25.774
Are you having a good time?

50:28.319 --> 50:33.222
We're having an incredible time.
We're having the time of our lives.

50:33.324 --> 50:36.054
What the hell are you doing down here?
Why don't you go to your room?

50:38.795 --> 50:40.160
She's...

50:40.264 --> 50:42.129
Here are your Flytails.

50:42.933 --> 50:43.900
Thank you!

50:44.001 --> 50:45.696
Sweetheart, will you help me
with the drinks?

50:45.802 --> 50:50.432
Yeah, sure, Dream Weaver.
No problem. Just gonna help her.

50:51.208 --> 50:52.641
Take it easy.

50:54.176 --> 50:56.940
Hey, next time you tell people
we're married,

50:57.046 --> 50:59.913
I'd appreciate
if you at least acted happy.

51:00.049 --> 51:02.381
Yeah, well, actually...

51:02.485 --> 51:04.680
Miranda! Where have you been?

51:04.787 --> 51:07.255
Relax, everybody, I got more booze.

51:08.090 --> 51:10.217
- This is my friend, Eddie.
- Hi.

51:10.325 --> 51:13.317
Hey, how'd you manage
to make a friend down here, Miranda?

51:13.428 --> 51:15.293
I put an ad in the paper.

51:15.397 --> 51:19.060
Eddie, this is my family, starting with
my aunt and uncle, Beryl and Boo.

51:19.167 --> 51:21.192
Beryl and Boo.
It's your anniversary, right?

51:21.303 --> 51:22.770
- That's right.
- Congratulations.

51:22.871 --> 51:23.838
Thank you.

51:23.938 --> 51:27.374
I think that's a beautiful name, Boo.
Is that short for something?

51:27.474 --> 51:28.668
I'm Boo.

51:29.310 --> 51:30.299
Sorry.

51:30.411 --> 51:32.971
- Yeah, it's short for Buford.
- Buford?

51:33.480 --> 51:36.142
Okay.
But why don't they call you "Byoo"?

51:38.952 --> 51:41.477
Byoo! Why didn't we ever think of that?

51:41.587 --> 51:44.954
It's been sitting there for 30 years
and we never even noticed it.

51:45.058 --> 51:48.926
And then you walk up, and boom!
You are a hair-trigger is what you are.

51:49.028 --> 51:50.893
That is too funny.

51:52.899 --> 51:54.924
These are my cousins, Buzz and Martin.

51:55.033 --> 51:56.625
- Hello, Mr. Funny, I'm Buzz.
- Pleasure to meet you.

51:56.735 --> 51:58.999
And their lovely wives,
Deborah and Gayla.

51:59.104 --> 52:02.596
I remember you, Eddie.
You're the film buff, right?

52:02.708 --> 52:06.701
And the lovely man in the back is
my Grandpa Anderson.

52:06.812 --> 52:08.973
Hi there.

52:09.080 --> 52:10.274
Well, nice to meet all of you guys.

52:10.381 --> 52:12.542
I'm gonna get running,
but have a great night.

52:12.650 --> 52:14.049
- Excuse me, <i>señor.</i>
- Yeah?

52:14.151 --> 52:17.211
You have a round of shots
from your new friends.

52:18.789 --> 52:20.017
Oh! Well!

52:20.458 --> 52:21.982
Thank you.

52:23.227 --> 52:25.525
Nope. Deborah and myself will not
be having any, thank you.

52:25.628 --> 52:29.928
Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass also.
I just... Yeah. I think I'm gonna...

52:30.033 --> 52:33.935
Yeah, I don't think you're gonna
get off that easy, sweetheart.

52:34.471 --> 52:35.438
Thank you!

52:35.538 --> 52:38.769
Well, might as well give them
their money's worth. Thank you.

52:38.874 --> 52:40.967
Hey, here's to Beryl and Byoo.

52:41.977 --> 52:43.535
He did it again!

52:45.047 --> 52:46.674
You are too much.

52:47.750 --> 52:52.119
All right, everybody. Are you ready?
Bottoms up!

52:54.522 --> 52:56.683
This is awful! That's, like, awful!

52:56.791 --> 52:58.452
It's like somebody
gets inside your chest

52:58.559 --> 53:00.789
and just like, a guy with, like, a bongo.

53:00.895 --> 53:03.523
And we gotta pay for it!
That's the punchline. Oh, man.

53:03.631 --> 53:05.724
So, Martin, you're
a high school baseball coach.

53:05.833 --> 53:07.767
- Yeah.
- That is so cool.

53:07.869 --> 53:10.030
Boo actually coached the team
before Martin did.

53:10.137 --> 53:12.628
Never missed a game in 28 years.

53:12.739 --> 53:15.867
Well, there were a few games
I wish I had missed.

53:17.244 --> 53:19.712
And Miranda coaches
the women's lacrosse team at Ole Miss.

53:19.813 --> 53:20.802
That's right.

53:20.914 --> 53:22.438
- I do.
- You're a lacrosse coach?

53:22.549 --> 53:25.279
- I am.
- That is... Wow. That's...

53:25.384 --> 53:27.818
- So you're a whole family of coaches.
- Yes, we are.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.582
You know, there was a big article about
them in the <i>Oxford Eagle.</i>

53:30.689 --> 53:32.748
You could still probably find that online.

53:32.858 --> 53:35.452
That's amazing.
And what about you, Buzz?

53:35.561 --> 53:36.619
I'm not a coach.

53:36.729 --> 53:39.664
I have a couple Subway sandwich shops
in the Oxford area.

53:39.764 --> 53:42.232
And we're about to open up
a third on Route 122.

53:42.333 --> 53:45.700
We find if you keep the tuna fresh,
they'll keep coming back.

53:45.804 --> 53:47.271
At Subway. Oh, I love Subway.

53:47.372 --> 53:49.203
We're also gonna open
a Ruby Tuesday's.

53:49.307 --> 53:50.535
We're gonna take it to the next level.

53:50.642 --> 53:51.734
But that's this, okay?

53:51.843 --> 53:54.812
That's right. Don't let it leave this circle.

53:54.912 --> 53:56.209
That's exciting. That's great.

53:56.313 --> 53:58.975
We wanna keep it all,
you know, class organizations,

53:59.083 --> 54:00.710
good food, served in a hurry.

54:00.818 --> 54:03.343
And with metal silverware this time.

54:03.454 --> 54:05.081
- That's cool.
- How about you, Eddie?

54:05.189 --> 54:06.520
You a sports fan?

54:06.623 --> 54:10.582
I am. Actually, I own a sporting goods
store up in San Francisco.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.787
Yeah. I love sports.

54:12.895 --> 54:15.864
In fact, I even lost my virginity
on a baseball diamond.

54:15.965 --> 54:18.399
- You're too much. Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

54:18.501 --> 54:21.527
Couple of the older kids
pushed me down, and...

54:23.406 --> 54:25.033
It was not pretty.

54:28.443 --> 54:30.172
Did you file charges?

54:30.946 --> 54:31.970
No.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.947
- He was making a joke, Gayla.
- Yeah, I was just...

54:35.050 --> 54:36.608
About anal rape?

54:43.090 --> 54:44.682
You are a pistol.

54:48.028 --> 54:49.552
My point is,

54:49.663 --> 54:50.891
why do we always assume

54:50.998 --> 54:54.024
that the aliens from the spaceships
are people?

54:55.168 --> 54:59.195
Why couldn't they be cows
from that planet?

54:59.372 --> 55:00.532
Right!

55:00.640 --> 55:02.335
Do you understand what I'm saying?

55:02.442 --> 55:04.501
So even if the cows are so evolved

55:04.611 --> 55:08.342
to the point where they're smart enough
to build flying saucers,

55:08.448 --> 55:11.440
the people on the planet
are probably so far past that

55:11.550 --> 55:13.347
that they still look down at the cows.

55:13.452 --> 55:14.441
Perhaps.

55:14.553 --> 55:17.920
They're saying, "Look at the dumb cows
and their stupid UFOs."

55:18.023 --> 55:20.753
Or "FO" to them,
because they know what it is.

55:20.859 --> 55:24.625
- Yes, exactly.
- Hey. So... Here, okay.

55:24.729 --> 55:28.130
Can I just say, about your family,
apropos of nothing?

55:28.900 --> 55:30.959
I love them. They're awesome.

55:31.068 --> 55:32.695
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

55:34.071 --> 55:35.698
With one exception.

55:35.840 --> 55:38.900
I get a weird vibe from... Marvin?

55:39.010 --> 55:40.307
- Martin.
- Martin.

55:40.410 --> 55:42.901
Yes, I feel like Martin is

55:43.013 --> 55:46.414
maybe just a little bit of a big,
wet, flapping douchebag?

55:46.516 --> 55:50.282
- Dude! That's my cousin!
- Just saying. JS.

55:50.387 --> 55:51.718
- He's cool.
- Come on.

55:51.821 --> 55:55.917
He's... Martin's just got a burr
up his butt lately, 'cause he's...

55:57.259 --> 56:01.923
'Cause there's this guy back home, Cal.
It's his best friend.

56:02.998 --> 56:06.092
And up until about a month ago,
we were serious, so...

56:06.202 --> 56:09.194
I guess it comes to a point where it's
gonna happen or it's not gonna happen.

56:09.305 --> 56:10.431
Right, right.

56:10.538 --> 56:13.939
And he or you did not want it
to happen, or...

56:14.042 --> 56:18.411
He's like one of those guys who likes
his routine a lot, you know, so...

56:18.513 --> 56:20.344
- So he didn't want...
- He didn't want to mess with that.

56:20.448 --> 56:25.476
What... So, you mean, like... Marriage?
Like he didn't want to marry you?

56:25.586 --> 56:27.053
- Can you believe that?
- No.

56:27.154 --> 56:28.451
No, right?

56:28.622 --> 56:32.285
What is his deal?
What the hell is wrong with Cal?

56:32.392 --> 56:36.192
So, anyway, I told him that I thought
we should take a breather.

56:36.296 --> 56:38.958
And now I'm realizing, with all the time
that we're spending apart,

56:39.066 --> 56:41.159
how different we really are.

56:42.134 --> 56:44.659
So, what about you, kind sir?

56:45.738 --> 56:48.206
Do you have a girlfriend back home?

56:49.709 --> 56:50.903
Miranda!

56:52.712 --> 56:54.509
- Where the hell have you been?
- I've been here...

56:54.614 --> 56:57.447
I've been stomping around
for 45 minutes looking for you.

56:57.549 --> 57:00.040
Everybody up there in the suite
is passed-out drunk.

57:00.151 --> 57:01.140
So?

57:01.253 --> 57:03.414
So, nobody's looking after Peepaw.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.489
I just caught him urinating
in the hallway.

57:05.590 --> 57:06.818
Oh, shit!

57:06.925 --> 57:08.017
You think that's funny, mister?

57:08.126 --> 57:09.787
How about I have you go up there
and clean it up?

57:09.894 --> 57:11.088
- Martin.
- Martin, relax.

57:11.195 --> 57:12.184
Sorry.

57:12.296 --> 57:14.628
We're gonna go deep-sea fishing
tomorrow. Do you wanna join us?

57:14.732 --> 57:17.724
Now, hold up, all right? We can't just be
inviting anybody to come along.

57:17.835 --> 57:20.463
Gotta talk to the captain.
There's weight capacity issues.

57:20.571 --> 57:23.369
Point is moot.
I can't go anyway, so we're cool.

57:23.474 --> 57:24.805
Good night.

57:25.341 --> 57:26.467
Good night.

57:26.576 --> 57:27.873
I'll see you. Okay.

57:27.977 --> 57:29.444
I smell something weird out here.

57:29.545 --> 57:33.037
Smells like somebody's
been hitting the devil's lettuce.

57:50.565 --> 57:52.294
Where have you been?

57:53.368 --> 57:54.892
Hi! Hey!

57:56.404 --> 57:59.373
Honey, I was downstairs.

57:59.473 --> 58:00.565
Downstairs.

58:00.675 --> 58:02.609
You left here seven hours ago, Eddie.

58:02.710 --> 58:04.177
You said you were just going
to have dinner.

58:04.278 --> 58:06.075
I did! I did. I was right down at the bar.

58:06.180 --> 58:09.581
I had the chimichangas
and the chalupa sampler on the side.

58:09.684 --> 58:11.515
Chimichangas don't take that long.

58:11.618 --> 58:14.678
No, no, they were quick. The chalupas
were a little slow coming out.

58:14.788 --> 58:17.120
But, honey, what happened was
I met this great older couple

58:17.223 --> 58:20.215
who found out it was our honeymoon,
and so they offered to buy me a shot

58:20.327 --> 58:22.955
and this other group a shot, and then
we all ended up having shots, and...

58:23.063 --> 58:24.189
What other group?

58:24.297 --> 58:28.358
This other group. Just these rednecks
who were down at the bar.

58:28.467 --> 58:31.561
But cool rednecks, you know,
like Jimmy Carter types.

58:31.670 --> 58:34.161
Eddie, that still doesn't explain
why you're coming in at 4:00 a.m.

58:34.273 --> 58:35.672
when the bar closed at 2:00.

58:35.774 --> 58:38.675
Honey, you said you wanted to sleep,
so I wanted to allow you to rest,

58:38.777 --> 58:42.975
so I ended up just sitting on the beach
watching the waves all night.

58:43.181 --> 58:45.308
You were on the beach all this time?

58:45.416 --> 58:46.474
Yeah.

58:46.884 --> 58:48.613
- Really?
- Yes. Honey.

58:49.921 --> 58:51.616
- Eddie Bear.
- Honey.

58:52.056 --> 58:54.286
I don't want you to be... Careful!

58:54.392 --> 58:55.450
Okay.

58:55.826 --> 58:59.091
I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean
to take it out on you. I just...

58:59.196 --> 59:01.187
I've been so miserable.

59:01.298 --> 59:02.390
You know, I have this sunburn.

59:02.499 --> 59:05.366
I have a pill stuck up my nose.
I can't sleep.

59:05.469 --> 59:07.733
Wait, what?
You got a pill stuck up your nose?

59:07.838 --> 59:10.864
Yeah. I tried to take a Tylenol
for the pain, you know,

59:10.973 --> 59:14.204
and these Mexican pills are so big
that I started choking,

59:14.310 --> 59:17.609
and then it got stuck
in my stupid deviated septum.

59:17.713 --> 59:19.476
Wow. Did you try to get it out?

59:19.582 --> 59:23.609
These crappy tweezers don't work.
It's just stuck.

59:23.719 --> 59:25.778
Honey. I'm gonna take care
of this, all right?

59:25.887 --> 59:28.287
- Okay.
- I'm gonna get rid of your little...

59:28.390 --> 59:31.723
Your little unwanted visitor up there.
Here, go this way.

59:31.826 --> 59:34.090
- Okay.
- Good. Now tilt back.

59:34.195 --> 59:36.186
Hey, this is like that game Operation.

59:36.297 --> 59:37.525
Oh, yeah.

59:41.502 --> 59:43.402
- You touched my nose!
- Yes, I did.

59:43.504 --> 59:46.632
- Okay, you gotta hold still, though.
- Okay, okay.

59:52.413 --> 59:54.574
Wow, that's big.

59:54.681 --> 59:59.050
My face feels so swollen.
I should take the cream off, I think.

59:59.152 --> 01:00:00.449
All right.

01:00:01.754 --> 01:00:03.745
That feels so much better.

01:00:04.257 --> 01:00:05.747
How do I look?

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.718
What, is it bad?

01:00:09.328 --> 01:00:11.694
No. It's not that...

01:00:14.199 --> 01:00:15.564
Oh, my God!

01:00:16.535 --> 01:00:18.867
- Honey.
- It's awful!

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:21.962
Honey! It's not that bad! Babe!

01:00:22.073 --> 01:00:23.631
Lila, come on!

01:00:23.742 --> 01:00:26.802
Lila, they have our credit card.
We're liable for the damages.

01:00:26.911 --> 01:00:30.074
Go away! This is all your fault!

01:00:30.181 --> 01:00:31.546
How is it my fault?

01:00:31.649 --> 01:00:35.016
You threw such a hissy fit
about your stupid sunblock

01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:37.485
that I wanted to prove you wrong!

01:00:37.922 --> 01:00:40.948
You won, okay? Are you happy now?

01:00:41.057 --> 01:00:43.821
- Lila, that's crazy talk.
- I'm ugly!

01:00:43.927 --> 01:00:45.986
Honey, it's just a sunburn!

01:01:03.011 --> 01:01:04.069
Lila?

01:01:07.516 --> 01:01:08.983
Lila, come on.

01:01:10.152 --> 01:01:13.212
This is ridiculous.
How long are you gonna stay in there?

01:01:13.321 --> 01:01:17.519
None of your business.
Now leave me alone, Edward.

01:01:19.026 --> 01:01:21.153
Babe, come on, I gotta pee.

01:01:21.262 --> 01:01:22.752
- So?
- Let me in.

01:01:23.364 --> 01:01:25.195
Go pee somewhere else.

01:01:25.399 --> 01:01:27.560
Why don't you go explore Mexico
or something?

01:01:27.667 --> 01:01:31.330
Honey, I don't want to explore Mexico
without you. Come on.

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:33.636
Well, I wanna be alone.

01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:36.070
Well, you gotta eat.

01:01:36.409 --> 01:01:38.400
Wanna have some breakfast?

01:01:38.512 --> 01:01:39.877
Slide the menu under the door.

01:01:43.747 --> 01:01:45.237
- Hey, you!
- Hey!

01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:46.941
Hey.

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:49.450
I thought you guys were going
on that fishing expedition.

01:01:49.553 --> 01:01:50.986
We slept in.

01:01:51.088 --> 01:01:54.353
Yeah, I'm out a $150 deposit,
thanks to you, Mr. Party Boy.

01:01:54.815 --> 01:01:56.908
Well, I guess that's how y'all do it
in California, huh?

01:01:57.016 --> 01:02:00.179
You just rock on with no consideration
for other people's plans, right?

01:02:00.286 --> 01:02:02.777
All right, Martin,
stop being such a tightwad.

01:02:02.888 --> 01:02:04.446
We all gonna chip in for the boat.

01:02:04.557 --> 01:02:07.583
I'm not gonna chip in
for no goddamn boat.

01:02:07.693 --> 01:02:10.184
- You gotta hear this one. You tell him.
- No, you. All right.

01:02:10.296 --> 01:02:12.730
Earlier today we were walking on
the beach, having our morning coffee,

01:02:12.831 --> 01:02:14.458
and we got to talking about last night.

01:02:14.566 --> 01:02:17.296
Anyhow, Buzz was just saying how
much fun it was getting to know you.

01:02:17.402 --> 01:02:19.267
- It's really been a pleasure.
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.

01:02:19.371 --> 01:02:20.565
By the way, for his birthday this year,

01:02:20.672 --> 01:02:23.903
we're gonna get Boo
a license plate that says "Byoo"!

01:02:24.008 --> 01:02:25.066
Can you imagine that?
Christmas morning,

01:02:25.176 --> 01:02:26.939
he's gonna open it up,
it's gonna say "Byoo"!

01:02:27.044 --> 01:02:28.409
- No numbers. "Byoo"!
- "Byoo"!

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:30.309
That's great. He'll love that.
He'll love that.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.405
But that's a big secret.
Mum's the word, okay?

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:33.983
Who am I gonna tell?

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.279
- Good to see you.
- Take it easy.

01:02:36.387 --> 01:02:38.719
Eddie, what do you have there?
It looks like you're eating for two.

01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:41.290
Oh, no, no. Yeah. No, no. I just...

01:02:41.392 --> 01:02:46.352
I just wanted to load up on some carbs
this morning, so...

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:49.898
And eggs, too. Eggs and carbs,
and, you know, full-on...

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.364
Hey, here's something to do.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:55.563
There's a double-decker bus running
tours out to a town called Miraflores.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.536
It's the basil capital of Mexico.

01:02:57.639 --> 01:02:58.731
Let me see that.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.398
- Did you say "bagel capital"?
- No.

01:03:00.509 --> 01:03:03.069
I've always wondered how they cultivate
and harvest basil. That'd be great.

01:03:03.178 --> 01:03:07.239
- Me, too. Education. No, it's a herb.
- It's a herb. Italian herb.

01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:08.338
She puts it on a lot of
the food she cooks.

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:09.439
Everything.

01:03:09.551 --> 01:03:11.678
- Oh, everything. I love it. Pesto.
- It's delicious.

01:03:11.786 --> 01:03:14.311
- Is it spicy?
- No, it's not spicy.

01:03:14.422 --> 01:03:15.946
You can order a whole box of it.

01:03:17.258 --> 01:03:19.749
Uncle Tito will take care
of everything. Okay.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.091
Hey. Listen, Tito, I need you
to do me a big, big favor.

01:03:23.197 --> 01:03:24.721
300 pesos.

01:03:24.832 --> 01:03:25.924
You don't even know what it is yet.

01:03:26.033 --> 01:03:28.297
It is something nasty,
or you would be doing it yourself.

01:03:28.401 --> 01:03:29.959
All right, fine.

01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:41.810
Honey? Is that you?

01:03:45.651 --> 01:03:49.417
Good. I'll open the door,
and you slide it in.

01:04:04.168 --> 01:04:05.999
Thank you.

01:04:07.672 --> 01:04:10.800
Thanks. Okay. A little bit of salsa.

01:04:10.908 --> 01:04:11.897
Are you okay?

01:04:40.236 --> 01:04:41.635
But he keeps nipping at me.

01:05:21.774 --> 01:05:22.866
Lime!

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:25.275
Oh, my God.

01:05:26.812 --> 01:05:27.779
Good.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.272
Hello?

01:05:32.717 --> 01:05:37.245
Hey, Mac! Listen, man,
I owe you, buddy. This place is like...

01:05:37.622 --> 01:05:40.113
This is like my favorite place ever!

01:05:40.258 --> 01:05:41.987
I told you you'd love it.

01:05:42.093 --> 01:05:44.653
<i>And the people, the people down here!</i>

01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:47.592
Oh, my God, I know. Aren't they great?

01:05:47.698 --> 01:05:49.598
I'm seriously thinking
I should sell the store

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.962
and open up a place down here.

01:05:51.068 --> 01:05:52.695
I mean, wouldn't that be incredible?

01:05:53.637 --> 01:05:54.865
So, how's Lila?

01:05:54.972 --> 01:05:57.668
- Oh, I'm sorry, your name's Joachim?
- Who?

01:05:57.774 --> 01:05:59.036
Your wife. Lila.

01:06:01.911 --> 01:06:05.210
She's not so good.
She got a little sunburned, so...

01:06:06.082 --> 01:06:08.312
I've been hanging out
with this other girl.

01:06:08.418 --> 01:06:09.476
Yeah.

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.513
Wait. What, are you serious?

01:06:13.388 --> 01:06:16.152
Divorce lawyer?
What the hell are you talking about?

01:06:16.525 --> 01:06:17.924
Do you get a buzz off it?

01:06:28.769 --> 01:06:30.999
I'm telling you, the second we
got married it's like a switch flipped.

01:06:31.105 --> 01:06:32.470
She's a nightmare, Mac.

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:35.269
Yeah, well, bitches be crazy, man.
You know that.

01:06:35.376 --> 01:06:36.843
Tammy's always flipping switches.

01:06:36.944 --> 01:06:37.968
What are you talking about?

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:40.138
You're always talking about
how happy you are with her.

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:43.273
Look, you wanna know the secret
to a happy marriage? Do what I do.

01:06:43.383 --> 01:06:46.546
Plaster on a fake smile,
plow through the next half-century,

01:06:46.653 --> 01:06:49.918
sit back, relax and wait
for the sweet embrace of death.

01:06:50.023 --> 01:06:52.218
- Hey. Wow!
- What about my hips?

01:06:52.792 --> 01:06:54.817
- And my butt?
- Great. I love it. Looks great.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:56.293
Where is it?

01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:01.256
- Come on back!
- Yes! I'm coming, Alfons!

01:07:01.367 --> 01:07:04.768
So, this other girl. It doesn't bother her
that you're a newlywed?

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:08.772
No. I mean, I haven't exactly made it
clear to her yet, but I'm going to.

01:07:08.874 --> 01:07:10.637
I just have to find
the right moment, you know?

01:07:10.743 --> 01:07:11.801
Eddie. Eddie!

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.036
Hold on a second.

01:07:13.144 --> 01:07:15.874
Eddie! Come on, there are sea lions
in the ocean!

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.743
Really? Okay, hang on!

01:07:17.849 --> 01:07:21.580
She found sea lions now, come on!
Isn't that amazing? I gotta go!

01:07:21.686 --> 01:07:25.554
Don't! Eddie, Eddie! Come home!
Come home! Come home, Eddie!

01:07:26.591 --> 01:07:27.649
Wow.

01:07:27.759 --> 01:07:31.718
<i>Ashes to ashes, funk to funky</i>

01:07:31.828 --> 01:07:35.628
<i>We know Major Tom's a junkie</i>

01:07:35.732 --> 01:07:38.792
<i>Strung out in heaven's high</i>

01:07:38.902 --> 01:07:43.066
<i>Hitting an all-time low</i>

01:07:44.306 --> 01:07:46.331
Wow, what a great day.

01:07:46.442 --> 01:07:48.603
I had so much fun.

01:07:49.845 --> 01:07:52.143
Here are your Mexican <i>sombreros.</i>

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:56.277
Look, the gang's back.

01:07:56.385 --> 01:07:57.875
Basil sniffers.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.144
Okay, let's hurry up.

01:07:59.254 --> 01:08:01.586
We're supposed to meet everybody
on the veranda in 15 minutes, right?

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.658
Right, right. Okay, good.

01:08:09.064 --> 01:08:10.292
Hey, Dad.

01:08:10.532 --> 01:08:12.591
There's the guy from San Francisco
whose wife was murdered.

01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:14.794
- Where?
- The guy right there.

01:08:15.402 --> 01:08:18.667
Yeah, some crazy guy
hacked her up with an ice pick.

01:08:19.872 --> 01:08:23.138
They caught the dude, though.
Some guy named Ronald.

01:08:24.178 --> 01:08:25.475
Hey, baby!

01:08:25.879 --> 01:08:29.178
Eddie Bear's home!
And boy, do I got a story for you.

01:08:29.282 --> 01:08:31.546
Well, I hope so,
seeing that you've been gone all day.

01:08:31.651 --> 01:08:34.745
Honey. Guess what happened?
I go downstairs to get your breakfast.

01:08:34.854 --> 01:08:36.822
Who do I run into out of the clear blue?

01:08:36.923 --> 01:08:38.652
- Who?
- Yvon Chouinard!

01:08:38.758 --> 01:08:39.747
Who?

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:42.327
Yvon Chouinard,
big cheese at Patagonia.

01:08:42.428 --> 01:08:43.689
- And?
- And?

01:08:43.795 --> 01:08:46.059
Come on, honey,
Patagonia's like my biggest supplier.

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:47.688
I carry their entire line. You know that.

01:08:47.799 --> 01:08:50.359
So, Yvon and his buddies
are going out golfing. Water?

01:08:50.469 --> 01:08:51.697
- No.
- They ask me if I want to go.

01:08:51.803 --> 01:08:54.465
So, what am I gonna do?
Say no? No. Right?

01:08:54.573 --> 01:08:55.870
But you didn't bring your clubs.

01:08:55.974 --> 01:08:57.770
I demoed a set! TaylorMade!

01:08:57.876 --> 01:09:01.107
Sweet, too!
Added like 30 extra yards to my drives!

01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:03.872
- Who were the buddies?
- Just a couple of guys.

01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:07.939
This guy Lenny from Akron, insurance
guy. Kind of a stiff, but good golfer.

01:09:08.051 --> 01:09:10.145
And the local Patagonia rep.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:11.981
What was his name?

01:09:14.124 --> 01:09:15.523
His name was Six-toe.

01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:17.593
- Six-toe?
- Yeah, Six-toe.

01:09:17.694 --> 01:09:20.629
Amputee.
Lost four toes scaling up Everest.

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.162
Did it without oxygen.
One of those guys.

01:09:22.265 --> 01:09:25.234
By the way, amazingly, he showed me.
Retained the outer toes,

01:09:25.335 --> 01:09:26.962
lost the middle stuff
but kept the balance points,

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:28.059
which are all you need.

01:09:28.171 --> 01:09:30.071
In fact, he says
it gives him a better swing

01:09:30.205 --> 01:09:31.399
because he swings
right through the ball,

01:09:31.506 --> 01:09:33.872
less resistance. Fascinating guy.

01:09:34.576 --> 01:09:37.636
Eddie, since when has golf
taken seven hours?

01:09:37.746 --> 01:09:40.305
Yeah, well, we got behind
a Korean couple, so...

01:09:40.415 --> 01:09:42.109
But I'll tell you, it actually worked
to my advantage,

01:09:42.216 --> 01:09:43.844
because we got to talk shop,

01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:45.612
and if things pan out
the way I think they might,

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.712
we could be talking about some
really sweet credit terms for the store.

01:09:48.823 --> 01:09:51.689
Why didn't you call me?
I've been worried sick about you.

01:09:51.792 --> 01:09:53.055
Honey, I did!

01:09:53.161 --> 01:09:56.324
You get a mile outside of this place, it's
like trying to get reception on the moon!

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:59.058
What are you doing?
Are you going somewhere?

01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:02.897
Lila, I just told you, I'm taking them
out to dinner in five minutes.

01:10:03.003 --> 01:10:04.834
When did you say that?

01:10:05.138 --> 01:10:08.403
Okay. First of all, these people...
Let me explain something to you.

01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:11.944
These people, okay, they're primed.
This opportunity... Do you understand?

01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:14.673
This is the head of an incredibly
important outerwear company.

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:16.008
International, okay?

01:10:16.115 --> 01:10:18.948
They have taken the bait, and now
I just gotta gaff 'em, get 'em in the boat

01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:21.542
and club 'em to death. Kill time, honey.

01:10:21.654 --> 01:10:23.178
Kill time. I can't let the air out.

01:10:23.289 --> 01:10:25.450
Then all the momentum I built up all day
just evaporates.

01:10:25.558 --> 01:10:26.752
By the way, shouldn't take too long,

01:10:26.859 --> 01:10:29.760
because they started dropping back
the shots about two hours ago.

01:10:29.861 --> 01:10:33.922
So... Very interested
in anything anybody has to say.

01:10:34.032 --> 01:10:35.659
So, you know, it's gonna be good.

01:10:35.767 --> 01:10:39.259
All right. Well, hang on a sec.
Let me put on some makeup.

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:40.837
You're coming?

01:10:41.005 --> 01:10:42.768
Of course I'm coming.

01:10:44.107 --> 01:10:45.870
Yes! Good! Sweet!

01:10:46.043 --> 01:10:50.605
I'll just call down and tell them
to make room for one more on the skiff.

01:10:52.783 --> 01:10:54.216
On the skiff?

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:58.949
We're going out on this little 12-foot
Zodiac, inflatable job, twilight cruise.

01:10:59.056 --> 01:11:01.024
No, Eddie, I can't go on a boat.

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:03.057
Oh, crap. That's right.

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:04.717
You sure?

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:07.796
Because really, honey, we're only going
a couple miles out past the breakwater.

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:11.424
Right to where the continental shelf
drops off? It's supposed to be amazing.

01:11:11.534 --> 01:11:15.561
The guy said it's where they filmed
that movie, <i>The Perfect Storm?</i>

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:21.333
Honey, I'm sorry, I feel really bad,
but there's no way I'd last out there.

01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:24.374
You know what? Screw it. Screw it!

01:11:24.479 --> 01:11:26.242
What am I doing?
I'm on my honeymoon!

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:27.542
Thank you for getting my head straight.

01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:31.779
- I'm gonna call and cancel. Right now.
- What about the credit terms?

01:11:32.686 --> 01:11:36.349
All right. You know what? Fine. You win.
We do it your way.

01:11:36.457 --> 01:11:40.359
I'll go, finish the deal quickly, come
back, take you out for a late dinner.

01:11:40.461 --> 01:11:42.486
That sound good? All right?

01:11:42.596 --> 01:11:43.585
- Okay.
- Good.

01:11:43.697 --> 01:11:46.723
Also, there's some important stuff
I wanna talk to you about.

01:11:46.833 --> 01:11:49.495
Oh, yeah? Like, good stuff or bad stuff?

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:52.936
Like, well, you know,
at first you might flinch,

01:11:53.039 --> 01:11:56.497
but then, I think, in the long run,
great stuff.

01:11:57.577 --> 01:11:59.875
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

01:12:00.679 --> 01:12:02.374
- Oh, honey?
- Yeah?

01:12:02.481 --> 01:12:04.381
I'm sorry I swatted you away
this morning.

01:12:04.483 --> 01:12:06.849
I didn't mean to hit you so hard.

01:12:07.352 --> 01:12:08.910
Swatted me away?

01:12:09.521 --> 01:12:11.853
You know, when you were
sitting outside the bathroom door

01:12:11.957 --> 01:12:16.087
after you dropped off the food,
and you put my hand on your schlong?

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:20.260
You just surprised me, you know?
And I wasn't feeling so well.

01:12:20.765 --> 01:12:23.393
But I promise
I'll make it up to you tonight.

01:12:23.501 --> 01:12:24.627
Super.

01:12:31.308 --> 01:12:33.401
- Hey there, Tito.
- Hey, <i>Señor</i> Eddie.

01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:34.534
How's it going, man?

01:12:34.644 --> 01:12:36.271
- I'm okay.
- Yeah? Sure?

01:12:36.379 --> 01:12:38.847
'Cause you look like you got
a little hitch in your giddyup.

01:12:38.949 --> 01:12:41.577
Oh, that. No, it is a long story.
I will not bore you with it.

01:12:41.685 --> 01:12:44.779
No, no, no. You bore me. Bore me.
Please. I got all the time in the world.

01:12:44.887 --> 01:12:46.411
I'd love to hear. What happened?

01:12:46.522 --> 01:12:49.218
Okay. After I dropped the food off
at your room this morning,

01:12:49.325 --> 01:12:52.419
I placed my penis in your wife's hand
and she smacked it away.

01:12:52.528 --> 01:12:54.792
She nailed me pretty good, too.

01:12:55.664 --> 01:12:57.256
Are you for real?

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:01.829
What are you doing? You don't just...
You crossed a serious line there.

01:13:01.936 --> 01:13:05.633
That's not acceptable.
You don't do that. Come on.

01:13:07.742 --> 01:13:11.269
Screw off! You're joking, right?
You had me.

01:13:11.379 --> 01:13:12.778
- No.
- That's good!

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.577
No, I'm not joking. That's outrageous!
That's not acceptable behavior.

01:13:16.683 --> 01:13:20.779
You don't just go and take your penis
and put it in my wife's hand.

01:13:21.755 --> 01:13:24.121
Well, when you put it that way...

01:13:24.257 --> 01:13:28.125
Wow, I'm sorry. I feel really bad, okay?

01:13:28.228 --> 01:13:29.923
What were you thinking?

01:13:30.029 --> 01:13:31.121
It's just that, well...

01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:34.722
You come down here and you try
to bribe me with your porno tapes,

01:13:34.834 --> 01:13:38.565
and then I see you running around
with other women on your honeymoon,

01:13:38.671 --> 01:13:43.005
and I just figured that,
"Anything goes with this guy, hey?"

01:13:48.013 --> 01:13:49.605
All right, fine.

01:13:49.781 --> 01:13:52.079
I am sorry
for the misunderstanding, <i>señor!</i>

01:14:02.259 --> 01:14:03.920
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:07.220
Wow. You look beautiful.

01:14:07.331 --> 01:14:08.491
Thanks.

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:13.767
- So, you gonna walk me over?
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, listen.

01:14:14.938 --> 01:14:16.997
I gotta tell you something.

01:14:17.473 --> 01:14:21.239
And it's something I should have said
before, but I didn't, and...

01:14:21.344 --> 01:14:23.209
I know about your wife.

01:14:24.113 --> 01:14:25.273
You do?

01:14:27.183 --> 01:14:28.207
How?

01:14:28.317 --> 01:14:32.413
Beryl and everybody overheard some
people talking about it on the bus.

01:14:32.521 --> 01:14:35.081
They were talking about it on the bus?

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:36.885
So it's true, then?

01:14:37.225 --> 01:14:42.185
Yeah, but it's really important
for you to know that it is over.

01:14:42.631 --> 01:14:44.326
And I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.
It's just...

01:14:44.433 --> 01:14:45.900
You know,
at first it didn't even occur to me

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.524
because, you know,
when I first met you...

01:14:47.635 --> 01:14:52.299
And then... I don't know, I didn't realize
I was gonna like you so much.

01:14:53.107 --> 01:14:56.406
And I didn't wanna freak you out, so...

01:14:56.844 --> 01:14:58.675
You wouldn't have freaked me out.

01:14:58.779 --> 01:15:01.179
Really? So you're not mad?

01:15:01.714 --> 01:15:02.703
No.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.611
I'm sad.

01:15:06.186 --> 01:15:08.347
That must have been horrible.

01:15:09.556 --> 01:15:13.617
It was. It is. I mean, it sucks.

01:15:14.994 --> 01:15:18.725
You're like the coolest person
on the planet.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:21.759
Really.

01:15:22.701 --> 01:15:26.034
No, I mean,
I wasn't expecting this reaction.

01:15:26.505 --> 01:15:29.065
- So your whole family knows?
- Yeah.

01:15:32.009 --> 01:15:34.307
I can't imagine they're taking it
as well as you are.

01:15:34.412 --> 01:15:36.107
Of course they are.

01:15:36.481 --> 01:15:38.972
- They just wanna support you.
- Even Martin?

01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:42.211
Boo instructed everybody
not to even bring it up.

01:15:44.655 --> 01:15:45.883
Dynamite!

01:15:50.527 --> 01:15:51.619
The burros.

01:15:51.728 --> 01:15:54.697
You go to the top of a mountain and
they leave you there with a pack of...

01:15:54.798 --> 01:15:56.390
No, all the way up
to the top of the mountain,

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.831
and you can camp out there overnight.

01:15:57.934 --> 01:15:59.526
- By starlight, you make a fire...
- We should do that.

01:15:59.636 --> 01:16:00.898
- Totally. Totally in.
- I'm serious.

01:16:01.003 --> 01:16:03.028
- Anytime.
- We could do it the day after tomorrow.

01:16:03.139 --> 01:16:06.267
That would be... Okay, I have some
things that I have to move around.

01:16:06.375 --> 01:16:09.037
It will be a bit of a headache,
but I can make it happen.

01:16:09.145 --> 01:16:10.134
Buzz.

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:13.442
Am I the only one who's still
a little bothered by this guy?

01:16:13.549 --> 01:16:14.811
I believe you are.

01:16:14.917 --> 01:16:17.442
All right.
Well, let me ask you this, okay?

01:16:17.552 --> 01:16:19.918
This dude's supposed to be
down here in mourning.

01:16:20.021 --> 01:16:21.852
What's he doing
canoodling with Miranda?

01:16:21.956 --> 01:16:23.583
- And the goat was dead?
- No, no.

01:16:23.691 --> 01:16:26.524
- Really?
- The goat got back up.

01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:30.928
Everybody mourns in their own way.
Why don't you cut him some slack?

01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:32.259
He likes her and she likes him.

01:16:32.366 --> 01:16:34.334
And I don't think
they're breaking any rules, all right?

01:16:34.434 --> 01:16:36.061
I don't trust him.

01:17:18.242 --> 01:17:19.300
Hey.

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:21.338
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:22.604
How you doing?

01:17:22.713 --> 01:17:25.511
Honey, I'm sorry
for ruining our honeymoon.

01:17:26.283 --> 01:17:27.944
I'm such a sucky wife.

01:17:28.052 --> 01:17:29.451
No, honey, you're not.

01:17:29.553 --> 01:17:33.819
You're great.
You're an amazing, beautiful person.

01:17:35.325 --> 01:17:37.919
However, I do think we should talk.

01:17:38.728 --> 01:17:41.492
Hold on. I have something for you.

01:17:46.335 --> 01:17:48.565
I love that. Thank you.

01:17:50.138 --> 01:17:53.266
So anyway, I've been thinking...

01:17:53.375 --> 01:17:55.104
Honey, turn it over.

01:18:05.686 --> 01:18:07.313
Did you make this?

01:18:08.089 --> 01:18:09.579
Before we left.

01:18:10.157 --> 01:18:11.249
You made this?

01:18:11.359 --> 01:18:14.260
- You sewed this yourself?
- Yeah.

01:18:14.695 --> 01:18:16.128
And the hearts?

01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:17.754
Your heart and my heart,

01:18:17.864 --> 01:18:19.058
together

01:18:20.133 --> 01:18:21.327
forever.

01:18:23.536 --> 01:18:26.562
So, honey, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

01:18:28.575 --> 01:18:33.171
I want to talk to you
about nothing right now.

01:18:33.279 --> 01:18:37.613
I want you to get some rest
and we'll talk in the morning, okay?

01:18:39.084 --> 01:18:40.574
Give me a kiss.

01:18:40.786 --> 01:18:41.844
Okay.

01:18:42.454 --> 01:18:44.319
Eddie Bear, I love you.

01:18:46.691 --> 01:18:49.524
I love, love, love, love, love...

01:18:50.361 --> 01:18:52.124
Love, love, love.

01:18:53.665 --> 01:18:55.098
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:18:57.468 --> 01:19:00.369
So, what's this important stuff
you wanted to talk to me about?

01:19:00.471 --> 01:19:01.802
Yeah, okay.

01:19:01.905 --> 01:19:03.270
Oh, my God!

01:19:03.373 --> 01:19:05.898
This guac is fucking awesome!

01:19:06.009 --> 01:19:08.170
Is it? That's good. Good.

01:19:08.278 --> 01:19:10.269
Your hand, Eddie.

01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:16.146
Look, I'm just gonna
lay this out there, all right?

01:19:16.253 --> 01:19:19.780
I have not been a good husband.
I've been bad.

01:19:21.691 --> 01:19:25.149
I am so glad to hear you say that, Eddie.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.491
I mean, I thought I was losing my mind.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.325
It's like the moment we got married,

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:33.198
a switch went off
and you became this loony bird.

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:34.495
Yes! Yes, you're right!

01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:38.003
I did turn into... I've been a loony bird,
and it's not you, it's me.

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.767
This conversation
is all about my deficiencies,

01:19:39.874 --> 01:19:43.833
because as a wife you've been spot-on.
You've been incredible.

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:46.436
You've been doing everything
a wife should do,

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:49.984
and any man would be happy
to have a wife like you,

01:19:50.084 --> 01:19:52.678
and kudos to you for putting up with me

01:19:52.786 --> 01:19:55.516
and all of my junk.

01:19:55.622 --> 01:19:56.919
Thank you.

01:19:57.391 --> 01:20:02.055
But the point is, honey, you shouldn't
have to put up with your husband.

01:20:02.895 --> 01:20:05.864
You deserve so much better.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:20:05.965 --> 01:20:08.490
Yeah, you're apologizing.
That's very sweet.

01:20:08.601 --> 01:20:10.762
No. No, I'm not... I'm not...

01:20:11.971 --> 01:20:14.906
Oh, God, that frigging stuff is hot.

01:20:15.007 --> 01:20:16.474
Honey, look...

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:19.305
In life, sometimes...

01:20:20.412 --> 01:20:21.845
Sometimes we make choices,

01:20:21.947 --> 01:20:26.407
and in retrospect, we realize
the choice wasn't the right choice.

01:20:27.219 --> 01:20:28.880
Not a bad choice, not a good choice,

01:20:28.987 --> 01:20:35.051
just not the correct choice
for the people who are involved.

01:20:35.826 --> 01:20:38.124
What are you getting at, Eddie?

01:20:38.429 --> 01:20:39.487
Lila,

01:20:40.731 --> 01:20:43.996
we're not gonna be happy together
in San Francisco.

01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:51.363
Rotterdam! That's where you gotta be.
It hit me!

01:20:51.474 --> 01:20:53.374
That's where your destiny is.

01:20:53.476 --> 01:20:55.171
Cleaning up the bogs,

01:20:55.278 --> 01:20:57.212
and getting the environment
right over there.

01:20:57.313 --> 01:20:58.371
That's what you should be doing,

01:20:58.515 --> 01:21:02.849
not hanging out in San Francisco
with me, some sporting-goods schmo...

01:21:02.951 --> 01:21:04.282
Oh, my God!

01:21:07.623 --> 01:21:10.387
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

01:21:10.793 --> 01:21:12.226
I'm saying...

01:21:12.995 --> 01:21:13.984
Lila?

01:21:14.096 --> 01:21:17.031
This is gonna be a good thing, Lila.

01:21:17.132 --> 01:21:19.532
Lila, it's better. It's for the...

01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:26.201
Lila, you got a little piece of tri-tip
coming out here.

01:21:30.912 --> 01:21:33.972
This is so for the best. Do you hear me?

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.707
Can I call my mom?

01:21:35.816 --> 01:21:39.252
Yes, of course!
You wanna call her, go ahead, call her.

01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:45.615
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mom, it's me.

01:21:46.493 --> 01:21:48.688
No, no, I'm okay. It's just...

01:21:49.595 --> 01:21:51.187
Something's happened.

01:21:51.297 --> 01:21:52.594
Something huge.

01:21:52.698 --> 01:21:55.496
Eddie's moving to Rotterdam with me.

01:21:56.335 --> 01:21:58.064
No, no, wait! No, Lila, no.

01:21:58.170 --> 01:22:01.003
He doesn't wanna be
a sporting-goods schmo anymore!

01:22:01.106 --> 01:22:03.006
Hold on, he wants to tell you himself.

01:22:03.107 --> 01:22:04.972
I didn't want... Hello?

01:22:05.076 --> 01:22:06.065
<i>Hey, Eddie! You having fun?</i>

01:22:06.177 --> 01:22:07.576
Yeah, yeah, we're having a ball.

01:22:07.679 --> 01:22:09.340
<i>And I hear you're moving to Germany?</i>

01:22:09.447 --> 01:22:10.573
No, no.

01:22:10.682 --> 01:22:13.048
See, Lila got a little bit
ahead of herself on that one,

01:22:13.151 --> 01:22:17.611
and I haven't actually gotten through
the entire plan with her, but she...

01:22:18.055 --> 01:22:20.046
You know what? I gotta go.

01:22:20.491 --> 01:22:21.719
I gotta say goodbye, okay?

01:22:21.825 --> 01:22:23.816
- Okay. Yes.
- <i>Love you! Bye!</i>

01:22:24.328 --> 01:22:26.922
- Hey!
- Isn't he the greatest?

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:28.395
What's that?

01:22:29.399 --> 01:22:33.062
I know. I know.

01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:35.364
- How you guys doing?
- Not too good, actually.

01:22:35.471 --> 01:22:37.098
Beryl and Boo are set
to renew their vows on the terrace

01:22:37.206 --> 01:22:38.571
and we can't find Miranda anywhere.

01:22:38.674 --> 01:22:39.732
Have you seen her?

01:22:39.842 --> 01:22:41.639
Hang on. Honey, who's Miranda?

01:22:41.744 --> 01:22:44.577
Miranda, honey, is their cousin.
Their cousin.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.649
You know what? Excuse me
for one second. Come here.

01:22:47.782 --> 01:22:52.276
Sorry, Mom. Yeah, no. I don't know.
Just some guys.

01:22:52.387 --> 01:22:55.823
Guys! Guys! What are you doing?
You're killing me here.

01:22:56.324 --> 01:22:57.848
What is this? What's going on?

01:22:57.959 --> 01:22:59.893
Look, Martin, I know you're upset
about this whole thing

01:22:59.995 --> 01:23:00.984
with Cal, Miranda and me.

01:23:01.096 --> 01:23:04.065
But there'll be a time and a place
we can talk about it, but not now.

01:23:04.164 --> 01:23:06.029
I'm about to tell her.

01:23:06.133 --> 01:23:07.498
Who is that?

01:23:08.035 --> 01:23:09.468
It's my wife!

01:23:11.105 --> 01:23:12.163
Wife?

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:15.976
Guys, what are you, like, snorting
peyote? Come on, it's me. It's Eddie.

01:23:16.076 --> 01:23:18.636
- But your wife was murdered.
- What?

01:23:19.412 --> 01:23:21.403
Those twins.

01:23:22.048 --> 01:23:26.144
They said that your wife was murdered
by a maniac with an ice pick.

01:23:27.053 --> 01:23:28.281
No, no, no, no, no.

01:23:28.388 --> 01:23:30.219
Look, you guys, all you have to know

01:23:30.323 --> 01:23:32.018
is that from the second
I fell in love with Miranda,

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:34.059
I have not once cheated on her
with my wife, okay?

01:23:34.159 --> 01:23:35.683
And I'm not saying that
to toot my own horn, it's just...

01:23:35.794 --> 01:23:37.557
- I really haven't...
- You sick little prick!

01:23:37.663 --> 01:23:38.994
- Martin! Martin!
- Come here.

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:42.032
- No, stop!
- Here, take this.

01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:45.969
Hey, what are you doing?

01:23:46.071 --> 01:23:47.333
Get off me!

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.374
You gotta get yourself
right with God, buddy!

01:23:51.742 --> 01:23:54.040
- He is not worth it!
- Get off me! Get off!

01:23:54.912 --> 01:23:56.573
What is going on?

01:23:57.481 --> 01:23:59.210
Eddie, who was that?

01:23:59.984 --> 01:24:01.611
I have absolutely no idea.

01:24:01.719 --> 01:24:04.153
How's your... How's your...

01:24:04.254 --> 01:24:05.619
What do you mean, you have no idea?

01:24:05.722 --> 01:24:07.781
They called you Eddie.
You knew their cousin!

01:24:07.891 --> 01:24:10.860
No, I know. I mean, I know who
they were, they're the Patagonia guys.

01:24:10.961 --> 01:24:14.362
I just didn't understand
why they were so...

01:24:14.464 --> 01:24:16.659
You know, they get so...
Acting like that.

01:24:16.766 --> 01:24:17.892
Eddie, are you okay?

01:24:18.001 --> 01:24:19.593
No! I'm not okay!

01:24:20.536 --> 01:24:23.130
Look, Lila, we're not okay. It's over!

01:24:24.773 --> 01:24:25.762
No!

01:24:26.275 --> 01:24:28.106
Could you please go away?

01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:30.678
- What?
- We're over!

01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:32.679
- What do you mean?
- Stop!

01:24:32.781 --> 01:24:35.614
- What's over?
- Hang on a sec.

01:24:35.717 --> 01:24:38.777
Here! Here you go. Fifty.
Fifty Americano. Please stop, okay?

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.889
Can you... No! No, stop!

01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:45.653
Will you shut up?
We're trying to have lunch here!

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.252
Would you stop? I'm paying
a lot of money to stay at this hotel!

01:24:49.363 --> 01:24:51.388
I'm on my honeymoon.
We just want to have a nice quiet lunch!

01:24:51.498 --> 01:24:52.760
Eddie, Eddie. It's okay.
They're not bothering me.

01:24:52.866 --> 01:24:53.924
No! It's not okay!

01:24:54.034 --> 01:24:57.026
We're newlyweds! We just wanna have
a quiet time together!

01:24:57.137 --> 01:25:00.470
How can we have any good memories
if you guys keep...

01:25:01.274 --> 01:25:04.175
Eddie, Eddie.
It's okay, I am having good...

01:25:06.112 --> 01:25:07.977
Eddie, please sit down!

01:25:12.718 --> 01:25:16.882
Wow, I was starting to wonder
where all that passion had gone.

01:25:17.657 --> 01:25:21.787
Lila, I'm sorry,
but you and I are finished.

01:25:23.061 --> 01:25:27.088
What are you talking about, Eddie?
What about our Rotterdam plans?

01:25:31.102 --> 01:25:33.070
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

01:25:33.071 --> 01:25:33.332
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:36.471
Eddie!
You're acting like a loony bird again!

01:25:38.409 --> 01:25:40.843
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:41.712 --> 01:25:44.306
Oh, my God!
What happened to your nose?

01:25:44.782 --> 01:25:47.114
- Martin stuck a pepper up it.
- What?

01:25:47.217 --> 01:25:49.185
Look, there's been
a massive misunderstanding.

01:25:49.285 --> 01:25:50.877
I don't mean to be rude, Eddie,
but can this wait?

01:25:50.987 --> 01:25:51.976
No!

01:25:52.088 --> 01:25:54.022
I'm gonna be late
for Beryl and Boo's ceremony.

01:25:54.123 --> 01:25:56.489
Look, my wife was never murdered.

01:25:56.859 --> 01:25:58.884
- What?
- Yeah, my wife, she never died.

01:25:58.995 --> 01:26:02.658
In fact, I never actually said that,
it was just those stupid twins, they...

01:26:02.765 --> 01:26:05.427
What are you saying?
You're not a widower?

01:26:05.534 --> 01:26:07.468
- No...
- No, he's married!

01:26:08.503 --> 01:26:10.232
Martin just told me.

01:26:10.605 --> 01:26:13.574
He's been staying here with his wife
all week!

01:26:14.843 --> 01:26:16.834
What is she talking about?

01:26:17.779 --> 01:26:21.374
It's true, I'm...
But it's over, Miranda. I mean, it's...

01:26:21.482 --> 01:26:22.471
Get away from me.

01:26:22.616 --> 01:26:24.106
Miranda, it's okay.
Will you listen to me, please?

01:26:24.218 --> 01:26:25.947
Get away from me. Leave me alone!

01:26:26.053 --> 01:26:27.543
Miranda!

01:26:29.623 --> 01:26:31.056
Hang on!

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.386
Eddie!

01:26:43.737 --> 01:26:44.795
Shit!

01:26:55.748 --> 01:26:58.342
- Eddie!
- I was trying to tell you before.

01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:01.078
- Leave me alone! Get away from me!
- Miranda!

01:27:01.186 --> 01:27:03.746
Eddie! What the hell is going on?

01:27:03.856 --> 01:27:06.882
Lila, I was trying to tell you before,
and I...

01:27:07.458 --> 01:27:10.120
Did I cut my back on the rocks?

01:27:11.295 --> 01:27:12.785
Oh, my God!

01:27:13.131 --> 01:27:14.598
Man-o'-war!

01:27:14.699 --> 01:27:17.395
Get it off! Get it off!

01:27:30.914 --> 01:27:32.006
Come on, do something.

01:27:32.115 --> 01:27:33.139
I'm not doing anything.
This is what he gets.

01:27:37.686 --> 01:27:41.053
- It's okay! I know what to do.
- What are you doing?

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.259
Get off of me! No! No!

01:27:48.264 --> 01:27:49.288
Oh, my gosh!

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:50.659
I know what I'm doing!

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.995
- No!
- Eddie!

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:57.000
- Burning! Burning!
- It's okay!

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.232
It's okay. It's okay.

01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:02.906
I know, honey. Isn't that nice?

01:28:04.678 --> 01:28:05.736
Sick!

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:11.211
Oh, no! It's okay, I'm his wife.

01:28:11.318 --> 01:28:14.344
- We're on our honeymoon!
- Honeymoon?

01:28:14.454 --> 01:28:17.116
Miranda, it's not what it seems.

01:28:18.792 --> 01:28:21.090
No. Wait, Miranda!

01:28:22.361 --> 01:28:23.919
Miranda!

01:28:33.206 --> 01:28:36.073
I think it was
a confluence of events, you know?

01:28:36.174 --> 01:28:40.270
With my dad busting my balls
about my dating life,

01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:42.945
then going to Jodi's wedding.

01:28:43.048 --> 01:28:47.280
Why did I even go to Jodi's wedding,
you know? Just to torture myself?

01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:51.916
Mac's all up in my grill about being
married. It's just...

01:28:52.957 --> 01:28:54.982
I don't know, I jumped,
you know, I jumped.

01:28:55.092 --> 01:28:58.994
I felt the heat and I jumped, and it was
like two days, three days early.

01:28:59.096 --> 01:29:00.825
And I'll tell you something.

01:29:00.931 --> 01:29:05.595
I should've just gone with my dad to
Vegas and double-teamed those girls.

01:29:05.702 --> 01:29:07.863
That would've been
the decent thing to do.

01:29:07.971 --> 01:29:09.336
<i>Señor</i> Eddie!

01:29:09.839 --> 01:29:16.108
Hey, there he is! <i>Señor</i> Tito!
My Tito-Bandito!

01:29:16.212 --> 01:29:18.077
Eddie, what are you doing?

01:29:18.181 --> 01:29:21.947
I'm just hanging with my brother,
my brother Manuel.

01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:24.018
Eddie, people are looking for you.

01:29:24.119 --> 01:29:27.054
Your father keeps calling, and then Mac
is trying to track you down.

01:29:27.155 --> 01:29:31.148
And what am I supposed to tell
the American girl, the... Miranda?

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:33.285
- What do I tell her?
- Miranda?

01:29:33.395 --> 01:29:34.623
- Miranda?
- Yes!

01:29:34.729 --> 01:29:37.960
- What?
- Her family flew home, but she didn't.

01:29:38.065 --> 01:29:41.034
And she has been everywhere
searching for you.

01:29:41.335 --> 01:29:42.529
She has?

01:29:44.472 --> 01:29:46.599
Screw off! I'm joking, man!

01:29:47.308 --> 01:29:49.708
That chick ran for the hills, huh?

01:29:51.578 --> 01:29:54.672
You should've seen your face!
You were so happy!

01:29:54.781 --> 01:29:56.976
For a moment, you were like...

01:29:58.251 --> 01:30:00.583
I can't believe I got you again!

01:30:04.124 --> 01:30:05.591
The funny man!

01:30:07.259 --> 01:30:09.693
That's cool man, that's cool.
Don't worry about me.

01:30:09.795 --> 01:30:12.093
Seriously, are you here for a reason?

01:30:12.197 --> 01:30:13.323
Huh? What's the deal?

01:30:13.432 --> 01:30:16.333
What, you want me to... You want
to tell me to, like, go back and get Lila?

01:30:16.435 --> 01:30:18.903
Or go back to the States?
It's not gonna happen!

01:30:19.004 --> 01:30:23.839
Look at you. Listen to you.
You are sounding <i>loco!</i>

01:30:23.942 --> 01:30:25.534
- Oh, I'm <i>loco?</i>
- Yes.

01:30:25.643 --> 01:30:26.837
No, you're <i>loco!</i>

01:30:26.945 --> 01:30:30.472
Lila burned my wallet, she burned
my clothes, she burned my passport.

01:30:30.581 --> 01:30:32.412
Okay? Even if I wanted
to go back, I couldn't!

01:30:32.517 --> 01:30:35.918
I can't get papers
for like a month or something.

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:40.754
But you know what? I don't need papers
to hang with this guy,

01:30:40.857 --> 01:30:42.290
'cause he doesn't want papers.

01:30:42.392 --> 01:30:44.883
He just wants friendship, don't you?

01:30:45.996 --> 01:30:47.327
And we're gonna stay here,

01:30:47.431 --> 01:30:49.365
we're gonna keep talking it out
and talking it out,

01:30:49.466 --> 01:30:51.866
until it feels right up in my head.
Right, Manny?

01:30:51.968 --> 01:30:54.528
Even if it takes forever. Am I right?

01:30:55.504 --> 01:30:57.802
Listen, you little <i>gringo</i> pussy,

01:30:57.907 --> 01:31:03.470
you've been ear-fucking me for
two straight weeks about all this shit!

01:31:03.579 --> 01:31:05.547
You wanna fix what you did?

01:31:05.647 --> 01:31:07.706
Stop talking about it, just do it!

01:31:07.816 --> 01:31:10.216
Get off your ass and do it!

01:31:14.155 --> 01:31:16.146
Manuel is right, <i>Señor</i> Eddie.

01:31:16.257 --> 01:31:20.250
You are going to have to go back and
fix this yourself, okay? Now, come on.

01:31:20.361 --> 01:31:21.521
- Get up!
- Can't.

01:31:21.628 --> 01:31:24.028
You can do it, come on! Listen.

01:31:24.131 --> 01:31:28.761
I have connections. You know, people
that can sneak you back into California.

01:31:30.204 --> 01:31:31.330
You're not joking?

01:31:31.438 --> 01:31:33.702
No, I promise. I'm not kidding this time.

01:31:33.807 --> 01:31:36.241
- Okay, good. Good, good.
- Yes!

01:31:36.342 --> 01:31:39.937
But I don't wanna go to California.
I wanna go to Mississippi.

01:31:49.756 --> 01:31:51.451
It's cool! It's cool, guys!

01:31:51.556 --> 01:31:54.150
I'm an American. I just lost my passport.

01:32:22.852 --> 01:32:24.080
America!

01:32:37.866 --> 01:32:39.026
Stop right there!

01:32:39.568 --> 01:32:40.626
I'm an American!

01:33:23.676 --> 01:33:26.076
- Come on, grab his hand!
- You can do it!

01:33:30.015 --> 01:33:31.915
Come on, buddy!

01:33:33.819 --> 01:33:35.582
Come on! Grab it!

01:34:01.411 --> 01:34:05.279
I'm going on the record here, Eddie.
I think this is a bad, bad idea.

01:34:10.753 --> 01:34:14.382
Look, Pop, I appreciate your coming
down here and helping me out.

01:34:14.490 --> 01:34:17.220
This is just something
that I have to do, okay?

01:34:17.326 --> 01:34:19.453
I still don't understand
what happened with you and Lila.

01:34:19.562 --> 01:34:21.530
She was such a sweet kid.

01:34:22.397 --> 01:34:25.366
Dad, I love Miranda, okay?

01:34:26.101 --> 01:34:27.966
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

01:34:28.069 --> 01:34:30.435
All right, Eddie. Just be careful, okay?

01:34:30.539 --> 01:34:34.066
Remember, this is the Bible Belt.
These people have guns.

01:34:34.743 --> 01:34:37.234
This is it, right here! Stop! Stop!

01:34:43.050 --> 01:34:46.076
Don't you think we should clean you up
or give you a shave or something?

01:34:46.187 --> 01:34:47.950
No. Look. I've been working on
this speech for over a month.

01:34:48.055 --> 01:34:49.886
I just want to go in and do it.

01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:51.480
Knock 'em dead!

01:35:07.039 --> 01:35:11.305
Seven pitches in a row over 90 miles
an hour? That boy hums that ball!

01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:15.737
Byoo! Look what the cat dragged in!

01:35:18.450 --> 01:35:21.476
I know, don't ask. Is Miranda around?

01:35:22.186 --> 01:35:25.178
- You must be out of your mind.
- Well, no, I'm not.

01:35:25.289 --> 01:35:29.282
Oh, my God! Why am I not surprised
that this moron's standing out here?

01:35:29.393 --> 01:35:30.860
It's all right.
Look, I don't want any trouble, Martin.

01:35:30.962 --> 01:35:33.260
Oh, you don't want any trouble?
You're about to get some trouble, boy!

01:35:33.364 --> 01:35:35.355
You better get off my stoop!
You piece of shit!

01:35:35.466 --> 01:35:37.696
That is a refreshingly honest response.

01:35:37.801 --> 01:35:41.100
And let me just drop some of that
back on you,

01:35:41.204 --> 01:35:45.072
and tell you I made
a huge mistake, okay? Guilty. Boom.

01:35:45.175 --> 01:35:47.575
I stepped in it, big-time.

01:35:47.677 --> 01:35:48.939
And I admit it, okay?

01:35:49.045 --> 01:35:51.138
I jumped into a marriage
way too quickly.

01:35:51.248 --> 01:35:53.307
I only knew my wife for a couple months
before we got married, okay?

01:35:53.415 --> 01:35:55.747
So that's the back story.

01:35:55.851 --> 01:36:00.049
And how long did you know Miranda
before you decided she was the one?

01:36:01.557 --> 01:36:03.149
Two days, and I hear that.

01:36:03.259 --> 01:36:04.988
Let me just say to you,
"That's my point."

01:36:05.094 --> 01:36:07.255
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake again, okay?

01:36:07.362 --> 01:36:10.024
You can rest assured,
I have got my act together.

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:11.792
And once my annulment is finalized,

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:14.231
I really believe that Miranda
and I should just go slow.

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:16.565
I mean, you know, date for a while.

01:36:16.671 --> 01:36:19.105
Move in together for like a year, at least.

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:23.075
See what it feels like,
then go from there, okay? No promises.

01:36:23.176 --> 01:36:25.440
- Really?
- I wanna do everything right this time.

01:36:25.545 --> 01:36:29.242
There ain't gonna be a "this time,"
Eddie. The popcorn has popped.

01:36:29.349 --> 01:36:32.341
Miranda and Cal got married
two weeks ago Saturday.

01:36:32.452 --> 01:36:33.510
What?

01:36:33.887 --> 01:36:36.287
What're you talking about?

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:38.858
She has finally come to her senses.

01:36:39.258 --> 01:36:40.225
I don't believe you.

01:36:40.326 --> 01:36:41.657
- Oh, you better believe it.
- Eddie...

01:36:41.761 --> 01:36:44.025
- I don't believe you.
- Eddie...

01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:45.427
It's true.

01:36:47.066 --> 01:36:48.658
They got married?

01:36:52.604 --> 01:36:55.198
Well, can I...
At least, can I talk to her in person...

01:36:55.307 --> 01:36:57.036
- No, you cannot, all right?
- Martin! Martin! Calm down!

01:36:57.142 --> 01:36:58.734
You will stay the hell away
from Miranda, okay?

01:36:58.843 --> 01:37:00.333
I'm gonna put my fist through your face!

01:37:00.445 --> 01:37:02.379
I'll put both of my fists
through your face!

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.415
I'm calm! I'm calm! I'm being calm.
You're holding me too tight!

01:37:05.517 --> 01:37:07.314
Stop it. Eddie...

01:37:07.418 --> 01:37:08.476
- Take it easy, boy.
- I'm fine.

01:37:08.585 --> 01:37:12.749
Now, look, we ask you to respect
Miranda and Cal's privacy.

01:37:13.791 --> 01:37:16.351
Give those kids a chance to be happy.

01:37:17.094 --> 01:37:20.621
If you care about Miranda,
that's what you'll do.

01:37:25.468 --> 01:37:26.867
Okay, Beryl.

01:37:29.806 --> 01:37:30.966
I will.

01:37:43.218 --> 01:37:44.742
Miranda!

01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:54.192
It's okay!

01:37:54.295 --> 01:37:56.263
It's me. It's just Eddie.

01:37:57.264 --> 01:37:58.731
Are you crazy?

01:37:59.867 --> 01:38:01.357
This is crazy!

01:38:02.436 --> 01:38:03.425
Hi!

01:38:03.537 --> 01:38:06.472
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:38:06.574 --> 01:38:09.236
Beryl told me you got married.
I just wanted to talk to you.

01:38:09.342 --> 01:38:11.742
This is my husband sleeping
right next to me. Do you see that?

01:38:11.845 --> 01:38:12.812
Yes, I do.

01:38:12.912 --> 01:38:14.743
This is not the time or the place
to do this!

01:38:14.848 --> 01:38:17.942
Please, please. Look, I'll keep it quiet.
I'll be cool. Just hear me out.

01:38:18.051 --> 01:38:21.111
No! I am not going to hear you out!
This is insane!

01:38:21.221 --> 01:38:24.019
I'm begging you! You don't know
what I've been through to get here.

01:38:24.123 --> 01:38:26.091
Please, just hear me out.

01:38:27.993 --> 01:38:29.858
You got one minute. Go.

01:38:30.162 --> 01:38:33.495
Okay, look. First of all, I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you I was married.

01:38:33.599 --> 01:38:37.228
See, I tried to tell you a couple of times,
but we kept on getting interrupted.

01:38:37.336 --> 01:38:39.827
And then there was this sort of
classic misunderstanding

01:38:39.937 --> 01:38:41.928
about my wife being murdered.

01:38:42.039 --> 01:38:43.199
Anyway, the point is...

01:38:43.307 --> 01:38:45.901
No! The point is,
whether you tried to tell me or not,

01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:48.604
you tried to pick me up
on your honeymoon!

01:38:48.713 --> 01:38:49.907
Do you know how creepy that is?

01:38:50.014 --> 01:38:53.643
Yes, I do. I do. It's repulsive,
and I owe you a massive apology.

01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:56.651
But, on the other hand,
I'm glad it happened.

01:39:10.699 --> 01:39:14.658
Look, it's not my fault the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

01:39:14.770 --> 01:39:18.365
And so, yeah, I screwed up, okay?
I got married a week too early.

01:39:18.474 --> 01:39:20.601
But you know what?
I wouldn't change any of it.

01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:22.142
I don't regret marrying Lila

01:39:22.244 --> 01:39:24.075
because if I hadn't,
then I wouldn't have gone to Cabo,

01:39:24.179 --> 01:39:28.115
and I wouldn't have met you, and
I wouldn't have fallen in love with you,

01:39:28.216 --> 01:39:30.707
and I will never apologize for that.

01:39:31.586 --> 01:39:32.814
Not ever.

01:39:34.956 --> 01:39:36.048
God damn it, Eddie.

01:39:36.157 --> 01:39:37.385
I know.

01:39:41.995 --> 01:39:43.223
Cal, it's fine.

01:39:43.363 --> 01:39:45.797
Martin! Martin, put the bat down.

01:39:45.899 --> 01:39:48.993
Just shush, all right?
This ain't about you, it's about him!

01:39:49.102 --> 01:39:50.160
What?

01:39:51.271 --> 01:39:52.602
Who the hell is that guy?

01:39:52.706 --> 01:39:55.732
This the psychopath who's trying
to steal your woman, man!

01:39:55.842 --> 01:39:58.436
I knew you wouldn't stay away from her,
you son of a bitch!

01:39:58.544 --> 01:40:01.570
I can't help it.
The heart wants what it wants.

01:40:01.981 --> 01:40:03.573
Eddie, you've gotta get out of here!

01:40:03.683 --> 01:40:05.878
Not until you give me an answer.

01:40:05.985 --> 01:40:07.885
No! There ain't gonna be no answer!

01:40:08.019 --> 01:40:11.420
Damn you, Martin!
Damn, that hurts! Shit!

01:40:11.523 --> 01:40:12.956
You... Martin, that hurts!

01:40:13.058 --> 01:40:16.687
You wanna throw down, tough guy?
I will mess your shit up! Come on.

01:40:16.795 --> 01:40:19.127
I don't want any trouble here.
Why don't you just back up, all right?

01:40:19.231 --> 01:40:21.062
Well, trouble's found you, pussydick!

01:40:21.166 --> 01:40:22.258
Dad! It's okay.

01:40:22.367 --> 01:40:26.827
Look, Miranda, just tell me,
do you feel the same way, or not?

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.640
We can figure everything else out.

01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:38.744
No, I don't, Eddie.

01:40:40.083 --> 01:40:43.416
We had a connection in Mexico,
and that's all it was.

01:40:45.522 --> 01:40:50.516
I love Cal, and everything that happened
in Cabo made me realize that.

01:40:52.328 --> 01:40:53.625
I'm sorry.

01:40:54.463 --> 01:40:56.021
That's the deal.

01:40:57.132 --> 01:41:00.533
Come on, kid, let's get out of here.
Come on, come on.

01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:04.900
Come on.
Bitches be crazy, you know that.

01:41:06.775 --> 01:41:08.003
Come on.

01:41:10.144 --> 01:41:12.112
Yeah, take care, Grandpa.

01:41:12.513 --> 01:41:14.174
Come on, let's go.

01:41:14.882 --> 01:41:15.940
Wow.

01:41:20.855 --> 01:41:22.083
Hey, Dad?

01:41:22.857 --> 01:41:24.222
Take a look.

01:41:24.357 --> 01:41:27.417
If she's watching,
it means I still have a shot.

01:41:30.263 --> 01:41:32.356
Your goose is cooked, Eddie.

01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:58.812
Come on, man. You can't leave me now.

01:41:58.923 --> 01:42:01.289
I finally straightened Tammy out.

01:42:01.659 --> 01:42:03.024
What does that mean?

01:42:03.127 --> 01:42:05.595
It means I stood up to her.
I told her that from now on,

01:42:05.697 --> 01:42:08.131
Thursday through Sunday,
it's gonna be bros before hos.

01:42:08.232 --> 01:42:10.462
I said, "I's needs my's alone time."

01:42:10.567 --> 01:42:13.866
Really? You said that? Just like that?
Putting your hand up, like...

01:42:13.971 --> 01:42:15.063
Like, half that, yeah.

01:42:15.172 --> 01:42:16.935
And she bought that?

01:42:21.178 --> 01:42:23.874
Honey, I'm conversing
with Edward right now.

01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:25.675
I'll speak to you later.

01:42:25.781 --> 01:42:26.975
Goodbye.

01:42:28.184 --> 01:42:31.017
- Wow. Impressive.
- Yeah, see?

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.350
That's how it's gonna be from now on.
Please don't go.

01:42:33.456 --> 01:42:34.650
Mac, we've been through this before.

01:42:34.757 --> 01:42:36.622
There's no reason for me
to be here, okay?

01:42:36.726 --> 01:42:40.992
Lila got the store in the divorce.
My dad's off in Vegas all the time.

01:42:41.096 --> 01:42:43.530
I haven't really met anybody
in the last six months.

01:42:43.632 --> 01:42:45.600
That's because you're still
hung up on that Miranda chick.

01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:48.760
No, I'm not! I'm over her. I moved on.

01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:50.633
In fact, I'm starting to think
there's a lot of good

01:42:50.739 --> 01:42:51.831
that came out of that experience.

01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:52.907
- Oh, really?
- Yeah!

01:42:53.008 --> 01:42:56.171
Like, you got to sit around
for six months in your panties,

01:42:56.276 --> 01:42:58.608
growing that funky beard.
That was awesome.

01:42:58.712 --> 01:43:00.407
Yeah, which is why I need to change.

01:43:00.514 --> 01:43:02.573
I can't just sit around
waiting for life to happen to me.

01:43:02.683 --> 01:43:04.014
I need to follow my instincts,

01:43:04.118 --> 01:43:07.349
and right now my instincts
are telling me that I...

01:43:08.489 --> 01:43:11.481
Mac, get your ass
in the fucking car right now!

01:43:11.591 --> 01:43:13.559
You got it, sweetie. Hi.

01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.355
Eddie! Think about what I said.

01:43:15.461 --> 01:43:17.053
Bros before hos!

01:43:17.664 --> 01:43:19.894
How you doing, Eddie? You sad?

01:43:20.867 --> 01:43:22.198
- No.
- Good.

01:43:22.835 --> 01:43:24.166
Good. Okay.

01:43:25.504 --> 01:43:27.131
Okay. Bye, Lester.

01:43:40.718 --> 01:43:46.156
Now, for another $150,
I can give you the Uncle Tito special.

01:43:46.257 --> 01:43:48.987
A guided tour to the island's best reef!

01:43:49.093 --> 01:43:51.994
- $150?
- That's a little steep, isn't it?

01:43:52.096 --> 01:43:54.326
Or you can find it yourself.
You guys are pretty big.

01:43:54.431 --> 01:43:57.264
I don't think you're gonna have
a problem fending off the sharks.

01:43:57.367 --> 01:44:00.530
Tito! Don't scare these people.
There's no sharks.

01:44:00.637 --> 01:44:03.071
There's sand sharks,
but they don't have any teeth.

01:44:03.173 --> 01:44:06.904
You see that attitude right there?
You have no business sense.

01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:08.443
Hey, Manuelito! Do me a favor.

01:44:08.545 --> 01:44:11.412
Help Tito give these folks
some snorkel gear, all right?

01:44:11.513 --> 01:44:13.003
Throw in the fins for free.

01:44:13.115 --> 01:44:15.982
- Oh, hey. Thanks, Eddie.
- Thanks again, Eddie.

01:44:19.521 --> 01:44:21.489
How much for a skimboard?

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.861
Hey! Hi!

01:44:31.666 --> 01:44:32.655
Hi.

01:44:34.135 --> 01:44:36.069
What are you doing here?

01:44:37.305 --> 01:44:40.604
Down here with the family.
It's that time of year again.

01:44:40.707 --> 01:44:44.837
Beryl and Boo are renewing their vows
on the beach this afternoon, so...

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:45.969
Wow!

01:44:46.213 --> 01:44:48.579
And, to be honest,
I had heard a rumor that

01:44:48.682 --> 01:44:50.775
you'd opened a business down here.

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:53.079
Oh, yeah? How'd you hear that?

01:44:54.087 --> 01:44:56.783
I got the e-vite for your grand opening.

01:44:57.256 --> 01:45:02.216
Oh, right.
Yeah, I had a group e-mail list that I...

01:45:03.996 --> 01:45:05.987
I can't believe you really moved here.

01:45:06.098 --> 01:45:07.292
Yeah, I did it.

01:45:07.399 --> 01:45:11.096
I became one of those
perma-vacationers,

01:45:11.202 --> 01:45:12.533
like we talked about.

01:45:12.637 --> 01:45:14.571
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah.

01:45:14.706 --> 01:45:16.037
Suits you.

01:45:18.476 --> 01:45:20.171
You look beautiful.

01:45:21.579 --> 01:45:22.739
Thanks.

01:45:23.815 --> 01:45:26.784
So, you down here with Cal
and the crew and...

01:45:29.253 --> 01:45:30.948
Cal and I split up.

01:45:32.322 --> 01:45:33.584
Split up.

01:45:34.892 --> 01:45:39.295
He's a great guy, but we probably
should've never gotten married.

01:45:41.097 --> 01:45:42.394
I'm sorry.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:47.863
I guess now I know what you
went through on your honeymoon.

01:45:48.971 --> 01:45:51.269
It's not easy being married when

01:45:52.775 --> 01:45:55.175
you're in love with someone else.

01:45:58.046 --> 01:46:01.345
He's in the car,
and I am dying for you to meet him!

01:46:02.717 --> 01:46:03.877
He's...

01:46:04.653 --> 01:46:06.587
Really? He's in the car?

01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:09.623
No! No.

01:46:14.295 --> 01:46:15.455
Funny.

01:46:16.063 --> 01:46:17.963
Got me. That was... That's good.

01:46:18.065 --> 01:46:19.054
- Very funny.
- Thank you.

01:46:19.166 --> 01:46:21.930
- So, you are single. You're single?
- I am.

01:46:24.138 --> 01:46:27.574
I'm actually staying at the hotel, if you

01:46:28.541 --> 01:46:30.873
wanna grab a drink or something.

01:46:32.912 --> 01:46:34.539
I would love that.

01:46:35.648 --> 01:46:38.310
How about tonight, 7:00?

01:46:39.185 --> 01:46:41.983
7:00, I could do that. Yeah.
I could do that.

01:46:42.087 --> 01:46:43.145
- Cool.
- Great.

01:46:43.255 --> 01:46:44.483
Miranda!

01:46:45.224 --> 01:46:47.658
Come on, we're gonna miss
the ceremony!

01:46:47.759 --> 01:46:50.023
- I'm coming!
- Hey, Martin!

01:46:50.128 --> 01:46:51.618
Hello, asshole!

01:46:52.297 --> 01:46:54.128
Great to see you, too!

01:46:57.301 --> 01:46:58.666
So, I'll see you tonight.

01:46:58.769 --> 01:47:00.828
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:07.436
Eddie?

01:47:08.746 --> 01:47:09.974
Who was that?

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.847
Oh, hey! Yeah, it's unbelievable.
That was Gretchen Construbias.

01:47:14.951 --> 01:47:15.940
Who?

01:47:16.052 --> 01:47:18.486
Gretchen Construbias,
the CEO of Da Huey?

01:47:18.588 --> 01:47:22.251
Da Huey Water Wear Sports.
They're, like, my biggest supplier. Yeah.

01:47:22.359 --> 01:47:23.792
Yeah, anyway, she's in town
for one night.

01:47:23.894 --> 01:47:27.261
She wants to get together and have
drinks at 7:00 to discuss credit terms.

01:47:27.363 --> 01:47:28.830
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

01:47:28.931 --> 01:47:31.195
Oh, but, honey, it's our first anniversary.

01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:34.736
I know, I know.
But, Consuela, I'll be back by 9:00, so...

01:47:34.837 --> 01:47:37.465
- Oh, okay. So we have a late dinner?
- Okay.

01:47:37.573 --> 01:47:39.438
Yes, perfect.
Late dinner, and that'll be good,

01:47:39.541 --> 01:47:42.271
because there's some stuff
that I think we should discuss.

01:47:42.377 --> 01:47:44.470
Oh. Good stuff or bad stuff?

01:47:44.946 --> 01:47:48.404
Well, I think at first you might flinch,

01:47:48.516 --> 01:47:50.882
but in the long run, great stuff.

01:47:54.289 --> 01:47:55.916
I love you, Eddie.

01:47:56.823 --> 01:47:58.984
Love, love, love, love, love.

01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:04.088
Fuck me.

01:50:56.257 --> 01:50:58.691
Cock me! Cock me!

01:51:01.663 --> 01:51:03.597
Yes, yes!

01:51:03.698 --> 01:51:05.461
Finally!

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:07.458
Yes, you're doing it!
