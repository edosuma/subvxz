WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:05.744
<i>- Lastly, on a personal note,</i>

00:05.788 --> 00:06.876
as many of you know,

00:06.919 --> 00:08.486
Kevin and I
have recently reconciled.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.662
- Noice.
Somebody's getting some.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.621
- It's true. I am.
Now, when we originally wed,

00:12.664 --> 00:14.623
we didn't know how long
gay marriage would be legal,

00:14.666 --> 00:16.755
so we had a somewhat
rushed ceremony.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.105
- Do you, Kevin--
- Yes.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.976
- And do you--
- Yes. Yes, we do.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.108
We're married.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.326
Kevin has always regretted it,

00:22.370 --> 00:24.720
so we're having
a vow renewal ceremony.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.635
This time, we're pulling out
all the stops.

00:26.678 --> 00:29.333
It's will be
a truly extravagant affair.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.118
- Oh, how extravagant
are we talking?

00:31.161 --> 00:33.076
Champagne pyramid?
- Destination wedding?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.164
- Celebrity officiant?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.731
- We got the salad forks.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.341
Can you believe it,
a second fork?

00:37.385 --> 00:39.909
Who do we think we are?

00:40.649 --> 00:42.825
Oh, no. You're shocked
at how garish it is.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.348
Now I don't even wanna tell you

00:44.392 --> 00:46.002
the other surprise
I have in store for Kevin.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.525
- Wait, let me guess.
You're getting bread plates?

00:47.569 --> 00:49.136
- Don't be absurd.
We're not crazy.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.964
No, the big surprise is...

00:52.008 --> 00:54.489
I'm retiring from the NYPD.

00:54.532 --> 00:55.620
- Wait.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.100
- What?

00:57.144 --> 00:59.276
- Why did you lead
with the salad forks?

01:02.279 --> 01:09.417
<i>♪</i>

01:19.383 --> 01:21.124
- You're leaving the NYPD?

01:21.168 --> 01:22.778
- My preoccupation with my job

01:22.821 --> 01:24.649
has been a point of contention
with Kevin for some time now.

01:24.693 --> 01:27.174
I wanna show him that
our relationship comes first.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.437
- But, sir, it's too soon
for you to retire.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.308
We didn't even get to do
one final cool case together.

01:31.352 --> 01:32.570
The last thing we worked

01:32.614 --> 01:34.181
was finding that kid's
missing mitten.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.878
- I thought that was rewarding
and poignant.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.140
- It was boring as crap!

01:37.184 --> 01:38.228
- What were you hoping for
otherwise?

01:38.272 --> 01:39.708
- I'm so glad you asked.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.623
We hunt down a serial killer,
stare death in the face,

01:41.666 --> 01:43.581
and then in the final battle,
you save my life

01:43.625 --> 01:46.018
and I say to you,
"How can I ever repay you?"

01:46.062 --> 01:48.456
And you say,
"You already have."

01:48.499 --> 01:49.761
Then you jump
on your motorcycle,

01:49.805 --> 01:51.241
drive off,
never to be seen again.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.764
- I don't have a motorcycle,
but Kevin and I

01:52.808 --> 01:56.159
did just purchase
recumbent bicycles.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.117
- you, Captain Holt.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.292
- Anyway, I already have

01:58.335 --> 02:00.294
a cool final case

02:00.337 --> 02:02.644
the police reform proposal
that Santiago and I

02:02.687 --> 02:04.646
have been toiling over
for these past six months.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.126
- Oh, my God,
I didn't even think about Amy.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.779
She's gonna be devastated.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.694
- Which is why I made sure she
wasn't here when I told you.

02:09.738 --> 02:12.697
I need Santiago laser-focused
on this proposal.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.569
We can tell her
after we turn the report in.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.353
Hopefully, you can keep
the news to yourselves for now.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.268
- Sir, she's my wife.
I can't lie to her.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.227
- What about that time
you spent $1,000

02:20.270 --> 02:21.750
on a Patrick Ewing Top Shot?

02:21.793 --> 02:23.795
- That wasn't a lie.
I just didn't tell her.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.842
But she's gonna be happy
about it, because that Top Shot

02:26.885 --> 02:29.453
is currently worth--oh, no.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.760
I will keep your secret
for $992.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.370
- Deal.
- Great, let's lie to my wife.

02:36.765 --> 02:37.896
- Ah, hello.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.507
Thank you for coming early
to help out.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.162
There's a lot to do since we
decided to go so over the top.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.467
I mean, look at the napkins.

02:43.511 --> 02:46.296
We're going
with a pretty whimsical fold...

02:46.340 --> 02:47.297
lengthwise.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.212
- That is...funny.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.475
- The intent was whimsy,
not humor.

02:51.519 --> 02:52.433
Now you have me
doubting everything.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.477
Where's--where's Raymond?

02:53.521 --> 02:54.696
- You know what?
I'll go find him.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.176
I got something
I wanna ask him anyway.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.484
There you are.
Why are you hiding?

03:00.528 --> 03:02.182
- Oh, I was just
looking at pornography.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.836
I felt an urgent need to watch
some men taking a bath.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.534
- What?

03:06.577 --> 03:08.797
- Okay, fine, you caught me.
I was checking my email.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.233
- And that's worse
than watching porn?

03:10.277 --> 03:11.582
- Much worse.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.628
Kevin can't know
I'm working on our special day.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.717
But I just received an email
from my contact

03:15.760 --> 03:18.241
at One Police Plaza
about our reform proposal.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.765
- Ah, yeah, speaking of that,
now that the report is done,

03:20.809 --> 03:22.332
can you please tell Amy
you're retiring?

03:22.376 --> 03:23.725
I don't like lying to her.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.292
- So then you told her
about the Top Shot?

03:25.335 --> 03:27.468
- I didn't need to because
I traded it for an investment

03:27.511 --> 03:29.209
in The Rock's
new cryptocurrency,

03:29.252 --> 03:30.340
which is currently worth--

03:30.384 --> 03:32.342
oh, no,
what happened to RockCoin?

03:32.386 --> 03:34.083
- We can't tell her.
Things aren't settled.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.259
The brass is having
a closed-door meeting today

03:36.303 --> 03:38.174
about our reform proposal,
but apparently,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.916
the union is gonna claim
that we fudged our numbers.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.309
- That's crazy.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.049
Amy would never fudge numbers.
She loves numbers.

03:44.093 --> 03:46.400
Sometimes I think
she loves them more than me.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.966
Stupid numbers,
think they're so great.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.707
I'd love to see numbers
give you a baby.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.014
- I'm gonna check those
CompStat numbers right now.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.885
I'm just gonna click
on this video link entitled

03:53.929 --> 03:56.801
"Handyman fixes squeaky door,
customer."

03:56.845 --> 03:58.281
- Oh, my God.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.543
- What? This isn't correct.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.284
Somebody changed these
since last night.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.851
- Wait.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.374
I bet O'Sullivan
hacked into the system.

04:04.418 --> 04:05.854
Do you know what this means?

04:05.897 --> 04:06.942
- They're trying to kill...
- Jake and Holt...

04:06.985 --> 04:08.073
- Police reform.
- Have a final case.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.292
Yep. Mm-hmm.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.685
Two equally important
sets of stakes.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.208
- He claims you messed
with the numbers?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.644
That son of a bitch.

04:13.688 --> 04:14.950
- I would never
fabricate numbers.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.343
I love numbers.

04:16.386 --> 04:17.735
- Numbers can't be a father
to your child, Amy.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.824
- So what are we gonna do?
- I have a plan.

04:19.868 --> 04:23.350
We can prove that O'Sullivan
changed the CompStat numbers

04:23.393 --> 04:25.656
if we find this.
- What is that, a bed?

04:25.700 --> 04:27.615
- No, that's a cheese grater.
- It's his computer.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.225
Obviously, I should have had
Terry do the drawings.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.575
Fortunately, I know how to find
his personal computer

04:31.619 --> 04:33.577
thanks to his YouTube rants
about the NHL.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.013
<i>- This is "Islanders Talk,"</i>

04:35.057 --> 04:37.755
<i>can hockey have female fans?</i>

04:37.799 --> 04:39.583
- Yeah, he's not a good person.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.324
Anyway, those videos
are taken in the "man cave"

04:41.368 --> 04:42.586
in O'Sullivan's basement,

04:42.630 --> 04:44.240
so that's gotta be
where his laptop is.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.460
Holt and I will be infiltrating
his house and retrieving it.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.417
- How are you gonna
get past him?

04:47.461 --> 04:48.766
- He won't be home.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.333
We're gonna lure him out
using his one weakness.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.422
- Rare Billy Joel
memorabilia sale?

04:52.466 --> 04:54.859
- Oh, that's nice, hear.
- Ah.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.296
- O'Sullivan will meet
with an ex-roadie

04:56.339 --> 04:57.949
named Geronimo Rodriguez,

04:57.993 --> 04:59.690
who will actually be
an undercover Terry Jeffords,

04:59.734 --> 05:02.040
our resident
Billy Joel superfan.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.520
- It was one time.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.696
You caught me lip-synching
to "Uptown Girl" one time.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.219
- Nope, he's your favorite
singer; everybody knows it.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.612
- And you're the only one

05:08.656 --> 05:10.266
O'Sullivan
hasn't interacted with.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.529
If he stumps you,
Santiago will be nearby,

05:12.573 --> 05:14.270
feeding you Billy Joel facts
into your ear.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.489
- You guys need
to keep him busy

05:15.532 --> 05:17.012
and then use a piece
of fake memorabilia

05:17.055 --> 05:18.840
to get a fingerprint we can use
to unlock his laptop.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.276
- What am I doing?
- You, Charles, and Scully

05:20.320 --> 05:21.669
will be here, distracting Kevin

05:21.712 --> 05:22.626
and making sure
he doesn't know Holt's working.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.672
- And who will be
on Cheddar duty?

05:24.715 --> 05:26.804
- I mean, can't we just
distract him with a bone?

05:26.848 --> 05:28.371
- Bone?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.851
Bone?
- Yeah.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.331
- Bone?

05:31.374 --> 05:32.941
Cheddar's not some street rat.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.725
This is never gonna work.
- Yes, it will.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.031
Just give me 90 minutes,
and I promise

05:36.074 --> 05:37.815
I will get you back
in time for your vows.

05:37.859 --> 05:41.166
- Fine, but if there are any
complications, I pull the plug.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.646
The ceremony is too important.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.996
Kevin cannot find out
what we're up to.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.433
- He won't, I promise.

05:46.476 --> 05:48.391
- Raymond?

05:48.435 --> 05:50.219
What are you all doing in here?

05:50.262 --> 05:51.481
- Peralta's watching porn.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.526
- What?
- What?

05:52.569 --> 05:54.092
- Peralta's watching a handyman

05:54.136 --> 05:57.052
repair a squeaky door
and then his customer.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.401
- Is that true, Jake?

05:58.445 --> 06:02.318
<i>♪</i>

06:02.362 --> 06:05.016
- Yes.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.541
- I wish I could say
I was surprised.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.020
<i>♪</i>

06:09.064 --> 06:10.152
- Told you
it was a great cover.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.766
- Okay, if we wanna get past
O'Sullivan's ma,

06:15.810 --> 06:16.985
we need undercover personas.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.856
I'm thinking you will be
Maxwell Maxwell,

06:18.900 --> 06:21.250
international playboy
and black ops specialist.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.078
He'd had affairs
on every continent,

06:23.121 --> 06:25.080
but his true mistress
is danger.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.255
- I thought you learned
your lesson

06:26.298 --> 06:27.648
about turning police work
into movies.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.606
- Yeah, I did, but this
is a movie about reform.

06:29.650 --> 06:30.999
I mean, isn't that a movie
you'd wanna see?

06:31.042 --> 06:32.087
- The only movie I wanna see

06:32.130 --> 06:33.393
is called
"The World of Mosses."

06:33.436 --> 06:35.656
It's a documentary
about the world of mosses.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.005
- It sounds bad.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.310
- Now, we will go in dressed

06:38.354 --> 06:40.008
as gas company employees
named Mitch and Henry.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.792
- Ugh.
At least tell me I'm Henry.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.142
Hello, ma'am.
We're from the gas company.

06:44.186 --> 06:47.058
My name is...

06:47.102 --> 06:48.495
Mitch.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.411
- Okay, this is how we'll get

06:51.454 --> 06:52.847
fast-drying dental resin.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.109
O'Sullivan touches this,

06:54.152 --> 06:55.676
leaves an imprint,
and we have a mold,

06:55.719 --> 06:58.026
Which we use to make
a fake finger that will fool

06:58.069 --> 07:00.463
99% of biometric scanners.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.160
Pretty sweet, right?
- I gotta say,

07:02.204 --> 07:05.990
I thought Holt retiring would
crush your mood, but it hasn't.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.252
- Wait.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.777
Holt's retiring?
- You knew that.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.300
He said he would tell you
when you handed in

07:11.343 --> 07:12.519
your reform proposal,

07:12.562 --> 07:15.173
and you handed it in,
and he told you.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.479
- No, he didn't.

07:16.523 --> 07:19.221
- Okay, well,
then I just told you.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.223
But you're still
taking it well.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.486
Amy?

07:23.530 --> 07:25.357
Amy!

07:25.401 --> 07:26.750
O'Sullivan just texted.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.710
He'll be here in three.
You gotta hide!

07:29.753 --> 07:31.625
Um...

07:31.668 --> 07:34.802

Kevin's on your six.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.984

- Yes, I do.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.551
He's, um...

07:44.594 --> 07:46.204
Come on, Scully.
Think of something.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.903
- Think of something.
What does that mean?

07:50.078 --> 07:51.296
- Cheddar did it.
- Cheddar, I know

07:51.340 --> 07:52.863
you wanted us to go
with the other vase.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.299
I have a different
aesthetic sense than you,

07:54.343 --> 07:55.736
and it's my day.

07:55.779 --> 07:58.086
Sorry you had to witness that.
I will get a broom.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.696
- Scully, tail him.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.350
Well, that should keep him busy
for a bit.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.612
- That was smart,
but I don't think

08:02.656 --> 08:04.266
we should mess with Cheddar
too much.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.397
- Why not? He's an animal.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.921
- Animals can be
very vengeful, Rosa.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.400
- Is this about Lieutenant--
- Of course it's about

08:08.444 --> 08:09.837
Lieutenant Peanut Butter.
- Yeah.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.926
- So here's the shutoff
to the main line.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.406
- Thank you very much, ma'am.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.973
Okay, to get into the basement,

08:16.017 --> 08:17.105
we're gonna have
to distract her,

08:17.148 --> 08:18.323
so here's what I'm thinking.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.238
Maxwell Maxwell
turns on the charm.

08:20.282 --> 08:23.981
Unbutton your jumper and say,
"The thing about gas lines is,

08:24.025 --> 08:25.766
"the pressure builds
and builds

08:25.809 --> 08:29.117
and it just needs
a little...release."

08:30.553 --> 08:31.685
You don't have to make
that sound,

08:31.728 --> 08:32.773
but if I were you,
I definitely would.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.252
- No one will be talking
about release

08:34.296 --> 08:36.080
or making the sound
of a rodent in labor.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.299
- It was a sensuous moan,
but fair enough.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.474
- We just have to get
the laptop

08:38.518 --> 08:39.736
so I can get back to Kevin.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.782
You will simply approach her
and say...

08:41.825 --> 08:43.827
- Ma'am, I need to check your
water heater in the basement

08:43.871 --> 08:46.569
to make sure there's no leaks
or blockages to the gas line.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.571
- You should maybe come back
later when my son is home.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.964
He's better at this stuff.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.226
- Oh, it's just a quick check.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.010
- The answer is no.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.143
- Sorry about him.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.579
He's a little abrasive.

08:56.623 --> 09:00.061
The name is Maxwell Maxwell.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.584
- Carol.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.238
- You see, the thing
about gas lines is,

09:03.281 --> 09:06.589
the pressure
just builds and builds.

09:06.633 --> 09:11.681
Sometimes...it just needs
a little release.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.338
- Well, we wouldn't want that.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.732
You can go down
to the basement now, Mitch.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.342
- Yeah, sounds good.
Have fun, you two.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.605
- Amy, look alive.
He's here.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.389
- You the guy selling
the memorabilia?

09:24.433 --> 09:26.087
- Oh, yeah.
- Where did you get this stuff?

09:26.130 --> 09:28.698
- I used to haul amps for him.
- Yeah? Which tours?

09:28.742 --> 09:30.395
- The, you know--

09:30.439 --> 09:32.572
- Oh, Terry,
I'm not ready to say goodbye.

09:32.615 --> 09:35.096
- I'm Not Ready
to Say Goodbye tour.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.533
- Never heard of that one.
- You haven't? That's weird.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.796
Maybe you just weren't
paying attention.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.277
- Sorry.
I'm on Billy Joel's wiki now.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.366
- I've done other tours too,
like...

09:44.409 --> 09:47.195
- Innocent Man and The Bridge.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.023
- Okay. What's in the box?

09:49.066 --> 09:54.550
- An early draft of the lyrics
to "We Didn't Start the Fire."

09:54.594 --> 09:58.380
- "Eisenhower, vaccine,
side salad, mixed greens."

09:58.423 --> 09:59.686
What is this?

09:59.729 --> 10:01.078
- Well, I guess, while he was
writing the song,

10:01.122 --> 10:04.038
he must have accidently
included his lunch order.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.866
Anyway, that's 10K.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.084
- Oh.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.695
What's the sticky stuff?
- Yes.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.653
- I grabbed that out of
the trash in his dressing room.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.655
It must be gum.
Look, I'm so sorry.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.004
Just let me have that back.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.658
- Ah-ah, not so fast.

10:15.702 --> 10:19.227
This has been
in William Martin Joel's mouth.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.359
His tongue touched this.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.926
- Wait. What's happening?

10:22.970 --> 10:25.146
- What's this, now?
- That is $10,000.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.495
And I'm keeping the gum.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.410
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.239
- A grown adult
with a man cave.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.457
This is so embarrassing.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.372
Oh, my God,

Okay, everything is all--

10:44.992 --> 10:46.950
- Your friend here
was very clumsy

10:46.994 --> 10:48.735
and he spilled on himself.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.607
- Well, we got everything
we needed, but I can wait

10:51.651 --> 10:53.740
if Maxwell needs
a little more time to dry off.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.917
- No, no, no, I'm all dry now.
We can leave.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.658
- Oh, wait, let me give you
my number.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.268
I only have the landline,

11:00.311 --> 11:02.531
so if my son, Frankie, answers,
hang up.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.185
He gets a little jealous.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.534
- Not to worry,
Mrs. O'Sullivan.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.276
Maxwell Maxwell is nothing
if not discreet.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.278
- Not discreet enough.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.627
- Okay, look,
I don't know

11:11.671 --> 11:13.150
what kind of freaky stuff
you guys are into,

11:13.194 --> 11:14.761

I think you're making
a big mistake here.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.551

He called me Mrs. O'Sullivan.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.248
That was my name
three marriages ago.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.989
I'm Carol Shaughnessy now.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.209
If he's calling me
Mrs. O'Sullivan,

11:28.252 --> 11:29.819
it's 'cause he knows
who my son is

11:29.863 --> 11:31.734
and you're up to something.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.562

Get down in the basement.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.348
- Well, I always like
going down.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.394
- I said move.
I'm calling my son.

11:39.437 --> 11:40.961
- Feel like she considered it.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.572
- We're locked in.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.921
If she gets in touch
with O'Sullivan, it's over.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.706
- Wait. She said she doesn't
have a cell phone.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.272
That means if we can
tie up her landline,

11:48.316 --> 11:49.665
she can't call anyone.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.539

with the phone?

11:54.583 --> 11:57.629

trapped down here.

Does that smile mean
you know a way out?

11:59.806 --> 12:01.155

He only barks like that when
he's worried about Raymond.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.382
- Oh, Cheddar's not worried
about Holt.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.036
I saw him eat a shrimp
off the platter earlier.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.472
I bet he just wants more.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.126
- Hmm, Cheddar doesn't usually
indulge in shrimp.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.824
He considers it bougie.
Speaking of indulging,

12:17.867 --> 12:20.696
the gray boutonniere
should've arrived by now, hmm.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.350
- Oh, Lord.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.613
- See?
Cheddar almost blew our cover.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.006
I told you
not to mess with him.

12:26.049 --> 12:28.269
- Charles, he smelled food
and he wanted to eat it.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.792
He's a dog,
not a super villain.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.881

staring you down right now.

12:31.925 --> 12:32.839

- From Captain Holt?
- From Billy Joel?

your entire identity

- I know, but Raymond Holt...
- I know, but Billy Joel...

messing up this mission.

take my ma's house.

with someone from the Nine-Nine
so they can get us out of here.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.707
Give me your phone.
- I left it back at the venue

13:58.750 --> 14:00.578
so Kevin couldn't track it
and know I was gone.

14:00.622 --> 14:01.884
Use yours.
- Mine's dead.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.755
I used up all the battery
mining for MetsCoin.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.367
It's the first cryptocurrency

14:12.286 --> 14:14.897
Just one problem.
I don't know her number.

your own wife's phone number?

14:17.291 --> 14:18.640
- It's saved in my phone.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.076
Stupid smartphones,
making me so dumb

14:20.120 --> 14:21.773
by giving me the world's
knowledge at my fingertips.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.819
- Well, I don't know
anyone's phone number either,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.603
except for Kevin's, and
obviously, we can't call him.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.431
- How do you not know
a single phone number?

14:27.475 --> 14:28.955
I've literally watched you
memorize the entire

14:28.998 --> 14:30.826
terms and conditions agreement
for a credit card.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.436
- True, but to make room
for important information

14:32.480 --> 14:34.438
like that,
I regularly purge my brain

14:34.482 --> 14:36.484
of useless facts
like phone numbers

14:36.527 --> 14:37.833
or the names
of people's children.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.315
- But you know
the name of my son, right?

14:42.403 --> 14:43.926
- The little guy
has his mother's eyes.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.101
- Yeah.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.146
- Rough night
with the little guy?

14:46.189 --> 14:49.062
Oh, hello there,
the little guy.

14:49.105 --> 14:52.326
- How did I never see that?
Am I a bad detective?

14:52.369 --> 14:53.675
- We don't have time
to go into that.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.068
- It would've been much faster
to just say,

14:55.111 --> 14:57.157
"No, you're great."
- Ah, what are we gonna do?

14:57.200 --> 14:58.288
- All right, look,
there's one number

14:58.332 --> 14:59.637
I still have memorized
that could help,

14:59.681 --> 15:00.595
my middle school friend
Mikey J.'s old landline.

15:00.638 --> 15:01.857

to believe

15:01.901 --> 15:03.554
that Mikey J.
still resides there?

15:03.598 --> 15:05.121
- Well, we were in a ska band
together in high school,

15:05.165 --> 15:07.732
so I'm thinking
the odds are good.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.170
- Okay, here's your resin.
Do your magic.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.476
- You're not gonna scold me
for almost ruining the mission?

15:12.520 --> 15:13.738
- No, Amy, I get it.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.132
But look, you don't need Holt
to succeed.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.830

person I know.

you could carry me again.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.750
It was very comforting.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.318
- Okay.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.277

I love you.

Cheddar.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.328

15:38.372 --> 15:39.503
Cheddar is up to something.

15:39.547 --> 15:43.420

Found Cheddar.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.049

Remember, you caught us
wearing your bras

16:04.093 --> 16:05.529

unclasping them?

The truth is... I enjoyed it.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.903
I had fun being
Maxwell Maxwell.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.601
- Yes.
I knew it was a good idea.

16:33.644 --> 16:34.819
- And I hate myself for it.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.256
- Damn it.
I interjected too soon.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.302
- It makes me scared that...
I'm not ready to retire,

16:39.346 --> 16:42.392
no matter how much I want to
for Kevin's sake.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.872
I mean, clearly,

16:43.915 --> 16:46.440
there's a part of me
that still wants to work cases.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.225
What if I'm making
the wrong choice?

16:49.269 --> 16:50.661
- It's completely
understandable

16:50.705 --> 16:51.836
that you would feel that way.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.055
You've devoted
your whole life to this.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.230
It's who you are.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.232
But you're also
Kevin's husband.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.713
- What would you do?
-

16:58.756 --> 17:00.889
I'm not sure.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.934
But I know
that when things are hard,

17:02.978 --> 17:05.198
I talk them through with Amy.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.330
And just being with her,
looking into her eyes,

17:07.374 --> 17:10.420
everything that seemed
so complicated

17:10.464 --> 17:12.118
becomes simple.

17:12.161 --> 17:16.122
And then... I just know.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.993

17:18.037 --> 17:19.864
- That's O'Sullivan.
He's coming home.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.953
- NYPD.
Step away from the door.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.652
- Wait, that voice.

17:24.695 --> 17:27.089
- Neighbors reported
seeing two men enter

17:27.133 --> 17:31.050
from an unmarked van,
then heard yelling.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.964
- There's been
a misunderstanding, Officer.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.879
- You are under arrest, punk.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.099
- You jags are so screwed.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.101
- I love your hat.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.668
- Kevin, I'm sorry.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.800
I will never forgive myself
for working today.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.890
I want you to know that this
will be my last assignment

17:45.934 --> 17:47.370
for the NYPD.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.676
I'm retiring.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.069
- Well, that seems like
an extreme reaction.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.071
- No, I want this--for us.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.637
- That's not for us.

17:53.681 --> 17:56.336
I never wanted you
to give up your career.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.902
Putting our relationship first

17:57.946 --> 17:59.426
doesn't mean you can't have
anything else in your life.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.255
It just means prioritizing me
over stupid little stuff.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.387
- Like returning lost mittens
to dumb kids.

18:04.431 --> 18:05.736
- No, that actually sounds
quite rewarding.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.086
- Really?

18:07.129 --> 18:09.088
- This reform program
is not a little thing.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.220
It could fundamentally
change the police.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.222
I just wish you had told me

18:13.266 --> 18:14.528
so I could've helped
from the start.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.920
- I'm so sorry.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.532
- Apology accepted.

18:18.575 --> 18:21.752
Now, let's get that laptop
to One Police Plaza.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.363
- No.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.104
There's something
I need to do first.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.018
- We are gathered here
to affirm the marriage

18:27.062 --> 18:29.195
of Raymond Holt
and Kevin Cozner.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.587
- We don't have to do this.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.546
Everyone who's not family
has already gone home,

18:32.589 --> 18:33.764
and we need to hurry.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.505
- No, this is important.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.812
Kevin Cozner...

18:37.855 --> 18:39.118
when we first got married,

18:39.161 --> 18:41.294
I thought of it primarily
as a legal contract,

18:41.337 --> 18:43.339
which is why I memorized
the entire federal tax code

18:43.383 --> 18:47.256
301.7701-18, definitions
pertaining to marriage.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.432
- And yet he can't remember
Mac's name.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.435
- But I finally learned
what marriage really is.

18:52.479 --> 18:55.090
It's not something
you can memorize

18:55.134 --> 18:57.179
or an equation
you can solve for.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.528
It's the feeling you get

18:58.572 --> 19:00.443
when you look
in your partner's eyes.

19:00.487 --> 19:03.577
And that feeling
is all that matters.

19:05.056 --> 19:11.150
Which is why I will now
purge tax code 301.7701-18

19:11.193 --> 19:13.978
from my memory
so that I will have room

19:14.022 --> 19:16.546
