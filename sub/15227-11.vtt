01:21.514 --> 01:22.947
Zena!
                        Hi!

01:23.015 --> 01:24.282
Look who's here!
          Oh, my God!

01:24.349 --> 01:25.383
Oh, my God!
Hey!

01:25.450 --> 01:27.152
It seems like
a million years!
                         I know.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.753
Long time,
           long time.
You look
fantastic!

01:28.821 --> 01:30.388
Oh, thanks.
                      So do you.
Oh, Zena!

01:30.456 --> 01:32.390
God, it's so great
          to see you both.
ALEX: Look at that!

01:32.458 --> 01:34.192
(Elaine laughs)
                  Wow!

01:34.260 --> 01:35.393
God.

01:35.461 --> 01:37.195
Hey, how's Louie doing, huh?

01:37.262 --> 01:38.396
Louie?
        Oh...

01:38.463 --> 01:40.298
Well, I'm sure he's
            happy at the moment.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.067
He's checking
                  the rat traps.

01:42.134 --> 01:43.301
Well, I'm glad
                      he's here.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.704
I have something I want
           to talk to him about.

01:45.771 --> 01:48.439
Oh, are... are you getting
back together, or...?

01:48.507 --> 01:49.807
No!

01:49.875 --> 01:52.109
No, no, no,
                     no, no, no.

01:52.177 --> 01:53.678
Uh,

01:53.745 --> 01:55.980
there's just this kind
        of formal affair

01:56.048 --> 01:57.748
I'd like to invite him to.

01:57.816 --> 01:58.750
Oh, yeah?
                           ALEX:
                          Hmm...

01:58.817 --> 01:59.884
Yeah.
      What's the occasion?

01:59.952 --> 02:02.120
I'm getting married.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.354
You're getting
           married?!

02:03.422 --> 02:04.555
Oh, my God!

02:04.623 --> 02:06.124
Congratulations!

02:06.192 --> 02:07.859
ALEX:
Hey!
             You're all invited.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.127
I always told you I'd invite
       you to my wedding, right?
That's right.

02:10.195 --> 02:11.529
That's right.
             All of us?
                           Yeah.

02:11.597 --> 02:13.398
Well, Zena, I mean, your
         wedding day is supposed

02:13.466 --> 02:15.267
to be the most wonderful
               day of your life.

02:15.334 --> 02:16.434
Why would you be
                 inviting Louie?

02:16.502 --> 02:18.569
You know, I believe

02:18.637 --> 02:20.939
that you don't stop
         loving people,

02:21.007 --> 02:23.374
even when you pass 'em by.

02:23.442 --> 02:25.176
Hey, you know,
          that's very beautiful.

02:25.244 --> 02:28.246
You just tell him what
        you told us... and duck.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.148
(laughs)

02:30.216 --> 02:31.382
Hey, would you
                look who's here!

02:31.450 --> 02:32.384
ALEX:
                            Hey!
                   ELAINE: Yeah.

02:32.451 --> 02:35.052
Well... I'll be!

02:35.120 --> 02:36.888
Alex Reiger,
    you old son of a gun.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.055
No, no, no.

02:38.123 --> 02:39.558
Jim, Jim, Jim...

02:39.625 --> 02:41.593
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.727
Yeah, yeah, it's great
           to see you, too, Jim.

02:43.795 --> 02:44.896
Great to see you.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.097
You remember Zena?

02:46.165 --> 02:47.431
JIM:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:47.499 --> 02:48.900
The boss's girlfriend.

02:48.968 --> 02:50.068
Zena's getting married!

02:50.135 --> 02:51.235
Oh, congratulations!
                   That's great.

02:51.303 --> 02:52.403
See that?

02:52.471 --> 02:54.038
Why... that boss.

02:54.106 --> 02:56.640
The monkey never said a word.

02:56.708 --> 02:58.643
Congratulations, Zena.

02:58.710 --> 03:01.212
You got yourself a catch.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.582
Uh, no, Jim, I'm
             not marrying Louie.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.117
Another man?

03:06.184 --> 03:08.519
Oh, perfidy!

03:08.587 --> 03:10.755
Thy name is woman!

03:10.823 --> 03:13.191
Jim, what are you
         talking about?
ALEX: Jim...

03:13.259 --> 03:15.860
Zena and Louie haven't been
together for a long time.

03:15.928 --> 03:17.328
She's free to do
                 what she wants.

03:17.396 --> 03:19.163
I think it's
                    great, Zena.
                        Yeah.

03:19.231 --> 03:19.831
TONY:
                Congratulations.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.132
Go back!

03:21.200 --> 03:23.034
Take the rest of the day off!

03:23.101 --> 03:24.769
What are you talking about,
             Iggy?

03:24.836 --> 03:26.171
I caught one back there.

03:26.238 --> 03:28.239
He didn't even finish
          the cheese.

03:35.347 --> 03:37.081
Hi, Louie.

03:41.687 --> 03:44.455
Um... uh...

03:44.523 --> 03:47.659
Uh, Zena Sherman, isn't it?

03:47.726 --> 03:49.660
You're looking good.

03:49.728 --> 03:51.763
Oh, thanks.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.564
I got a mirror
that tells me that.

03:53.632 --> 03:54.865
(laughs)

03:55.934 --> 03:56.968
You know, Louie, um...

03:57.035 --> 03:58.503
I have something
                    to tell you,

03:58.570 --> 04:00.872
but I don't think this
             is the right place.

04:00.939 --> 04:03.608
Can you meet me for a
        drink after you get off?

04:05.510 --> 04:07.045
Uh, I'll check.

04:08.347 --> 04:09.547
Uh, Jeff?
             Yeah.

04:09.614 --> 04:11.182
What's on my calendar?

04:11.249 --> 04:13.317
A roach.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.724
I'm free.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.159
Good, good.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.695
There's a nice bar in that
new French place up the street.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.862
Let's meet there, okay?

04:24.930 --> 04:26.230
Oh, <i>oui, oui.</i>

04:26.298 --> 04:27.465
(both laugh)

04:27.533 --> 04:28.967
I'll see you
                     in an hour.

04:29.034 --> 04:31.403
Okay. Well, it was nice
        seeing you all.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.403
So long, Zena.
                      Bye, Zena.

04:32.471 --> 04:33.404
Hey, good
to see you again.

04:33.471 --> 04:35.373
Right.
              Take it easy. Bye.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.043
Oh! Oh! Oh!

04:39.110 --> 04:41.612
It was bound to happen
        sooner or later.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.213
What was?

04:42.281 --> 04:43.982
Operation Crawlback.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.750
(laughs)

04:45.818 --> 04:49.053
And you guys thought she
was through with me, huh?

04:49.121 --> 04:51.089
(laughs)

04:51.156 --> 04:55.760
Well... if you'll excuse me,

04:55.827 --> 04:58.496
I got to go home
     and change my sheets.

04:58.564 --> 04:59.630
(laughs)

04:59.698 --> 05:03.267
I have to tell
    you, Louie...

05:03.335 --> 05:05.269
you're way off base on this one.

05:05.337 --> 05:07.438
Ah, relax, Reiger.

05:07.506 --> 05:10.175
I'm just shooting off my mouth.

05:10.242 --> 05:12.177
You want to know the truth?

05:13.746 --> 05:15.413
I missed her, too.

05:20.385 --> 05:23.821
LOUIE:
    <i>Zena, I took the liberty</i>
   <i>of ordering dinner for you.</i>

05:23.889 --> 05:25.856
So, what's on your mind, Zena?

05:25.924 --> 05:27.859
Well, you...

05:27.926 --> 05:29.393
Louie?

05:29.461 --> 05:30.928
(mutters)

05:30.996 --> 05:34.299
You know, we haven't seen each
    other in a really long time.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.301
(sighs) Yeah.

05:36.368 --> 05:39.604
So, uh, I was thinking maybe
    we should take a little time

05:39.672 --> 05:42.573
to kind of bring each
               other up to date.

05:42.641 --> 05:44.074
Up to date?

05:44.142 --> 05:45.476
Yeah, you know, like, uh...

05:45.544 --> 05:50.047
Haven't there been a lot
     of... changes in your life?

05:51.416 --> 05:52.817
Nope.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.919
Nothing's changed?

05:54.987 --> 05:56.421
You want to know

05:56.489 --> 05:59.156
if there's anybody else
that you have to worry about.

05:59.224 --> 06:01.459
Well, there have been others.

06:01.526 --> 06:04.128
There have been others,
and as good as they were,

06:04.196 --> 06:06.864
none of 'em earned
the Golden Louie.

06:06.932 --> 06:08.166
(laughs)
                      Oh, Louie.

06:08.233 --> 06:09.267
I...
You know why?

06:09.334 --> 06:12.169
Because once you've found
the exact person

06:12.237 --> 06:14.272
who's right for you
in your life...
                          Lou...

06:14.339 --> 06:16.774
Actually, I have, Louie.
        See, that's why I wanted
                 to talk to you.

06:16.842 --> 06:18.176
Shh-shh-shh.
                       Can I say
            something really...?

06:18.243 --> 06:20.445
Shh. Shh. No, no. Look.

06:20.512 --> 06:23.848
Let me make this very simple.

06:26.218 --> 06:28.886
The door is open, Zena.

06:30.588 --> 06:33.024
You've suffered enough.

06:33.091 --> 06:34.859
Come in out of the rain.

06:34.926 --> 06:36.394
Louie, I'm
                getting married.

06:36.461 --> 06:38.395
You know, I always thought

06:38.463 --> 06:40.164
that I would forgive you,

06:40.232 --> 06:41.865
but not this quick.
                       Louie...

06:41.933 --> 06:44.101
I'm getting married!
I mean, I thought that we...

06:45.904 --> 06:48.139
I met another man,

06:48.207 --> 06:49.974
and we fell in love,

06:50.042 --> 06:52.176
and we're gonna be
           married in two weeks.

06:52.244 --> 06:56.047
Oh, Louie,
                I am very happy.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.248
And I'm really hoping

06:58.316 --> 07:01.252
that you can
                be happy for me.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.254
Are you?

07:08.894 --> 07:10.828
Happy for you?

07:13.598 --> 07:16.000
Oh... (chortles) Yeah,
I'm happy for you.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.000
I'm happy.

07:17.068 --> 07:18.536
Yeah, I'm-I'm happy for you.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.537
(laughs)

07:19.604 --> 07:21.305
We're happy
for her, right?

07:21.373 --> 07:23.675
Yeah, yeah, that's good.
We're happy for you.

07:23.742 --> 07:25.343
We're happy. We're happy.
We're all happy.

07:25.411 --> 07:26.844
Whee! We're happy
for you.

07:26.912 --> 07:28.846
Give me that!

07:30.382 --> 07:32.283
Louie, I wanted
              to tell you myself

07:32.351 --> 07:35.320
so that you wouldn't find
    out on your own and be hurt.

07:38.290 --> 07:41.225
Louie, I know this
         must be a shock to you,

07:41.292 --> 07:43.327
but we've meant a
              lot to each other,

07:43.395 --> 07:46.497
and I don't want that to end
just 'cause I'm getting married.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.534
Louie, I want to be
               friends with you,

07:50.602 --> 07:54.972
and I'm asking you if you
       can find it in your heart

07:55.040 --> 07:57.175
to come to my wedding.

07:57.242 --> 07:59.510
I'd really, really
                  appreciate it.

07:59.578 --> 08:01.478
It would mean
                    a lot to me.

08:01.546 --> 08:03.480
Really, it would.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.384
(sighs)

08:06.451 --> 08:08.252
(belches)

08:20.665 --> 08:22.900
Who is he?

08:22.968 --> 08:26.370
Who's the guy?

08:26.438 --> 08:29.940
Who's the next victim?

08:30.008 --> 08:31.642
I think maybe this
            isn't the right time
                to be telling...

08:31.710 --> 08:33.510
No, no, no, no.
I want to know.
                     No, really.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.446
I want to know who it is, Zena.
         I don't think I want to
              talk about this...

08:35.513 --> 08:36.981
Not right now.
Who is it, Zena?
Tell me who it is.

08:37.048 --> 08:38.149
Okay. Okay.
             Sit down. Sit down.
Tell me! Tell me who it is!

08:38.217 --> 08:39.450
Tell me who it is.
                       Sit down.

08:39.518 --> 08:40.517
Okay, I'll tell you.
                  I'll tell you.
Tell me!

08:40.585 --> 08:42.352
His name is Tom Pelton.

08:42.419 --> 08:45.489
He's a child psychiatrist,
    and we met six months...

08:45.557 --> 08:47.492
That's enough.

08:47.559 --> 08:49.761
(sighs)

08:49.828 --> 08:51.462
I understand.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.135
I'm not gonna make this
       difficult for you.

09:03.141 --> 09:05.376
Would you at least

09:05.443 --> 09:07.378
have the decency

09:07.446 --> 09:10.114
to go to bed with me
       for one last time?

09:14.586 --> 09:18.455
I... I am going to forget
         you said that.

09:19.858 --> 09:21.859
Well, then I'll repeat it.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.596
Would you at least
have the decency...?

09:25.664 --> 09:27.698
Good night, Louie.

09:46.284 --> 09:48.686
She didn't even look back!

09:52.957 --> 09:56.927
You know, I'm not gonna pay
for a damn thing on this table.

09:56.995 --> 09:58.562
Ah, ah!

09:58.630 --> 10:00.798
I didn't say
I wasn't gonna eat it.

10:00.865 --> 10:02.699
I'm just not
gonna pay for it.

10:03.802 --> 10:05.202
I'll get the manager.

10:05.270 --> 10:08.138
Here. Bring me
    another bottle of wine.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.781
What the hell are
      you looking at, Mac?

10:16.849 --> 10:19.717
Huh?

10:19.785 --> 10:23.888
You never seen a man eat
        French food before, huh?

10:25.256 --> 10:26.423
Huh?

10:26.491 --> 10:29.660
Hey, don't look away from me!

10:29.728 --> 10:32.029
You're no better than I am, man.

10:32.096 --> 10:33.965
Huh?

10:34.033 --> 10:36.801
Just because you're sitting
there with a woman.

10:36.868 --> 10:38.602
Get up!

10:38.670 --> 10:39.937
Get up!

10:40.004 --> 10:41.105
Come on!

10:43.775 --> 10:45.242
Come over here!

10:45.310 --> 10:46.644
Come over here!

10:46.712 --> 10:48.646
(sobbing)

11:05.396 --> 11:07.331
How we doing, Jeff?

11:07.399 --> 11:09.333
You got eyes.

11:12.771 --> 11:15.873
I-I don't understand
  why you're acting like this.

11:15.941 --> 11:18.408
I wanted to go
                 to the wedding.

11:18.476 --> 11:19.844
I'm sorry, Jeff,

11:19.911 --> 11:22.346
but slow moments
   are the only chance we got

11:22.413 --> 11:24.715
to catch up on these little odds
            and ends

11:24.783 --> 11:27.552
that we have to do
      around this garage.

11:27.619 --> 11:29.520
We missed a spot.

11:30.956 --> 11:33.524
(Elaine laughing)
Hey, look busy.
Somebody's coming.

11:33.591 --> 11:34.992
(Tony mumbles)
Why are you saying that?

11:35.060 --> 11:36.594
(laughter)

11:36.662 --> 11:37.761
TONY:
What a great wedding!

11:37.829 --> 11:39.097
ALEX:
Lemme tell ya!

11:39.164 --> 11:40.398
ELAINE:
Oh, the best!
Yeah.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.567
The best! I can't believe
I caught the bouquet!

11:43.635 --> 11:44.935
You're lucky.

11:45.003 --> 11:47.071
I got this.

11:47.138 --> 11:48.438
(Elaine laughs)

11:48.506 --> 11:50.875
Good going, Jim.

11:50.942 --> 11:52.043
TONY:
That's great.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.210
That's looking good, Jeff.

11:53.278 --> 11:54.712
ELAINE:
She looked great.
         Looking good.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.180
What we have to do now

11:56.247 --> 11:59.716
before we do anything else
is put a coat of primer on it.

11:59.784 --> 12:00.985
Hey, you know,
              you guys are late.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.253
I got cabs to
                   get out here.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.454
Where you been?

12:03.521 --> 12:05.723
We were at a wedding, Louie.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.758
I really thought you'd show up.

12:07.826 --> 12:09.293
Was that Zena's wedding?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.328
Was that today?

12:10.395 --> 12:12.230
Oh, for crying out loud.

12:12.297 --> 12:13.898
Hey, what the heck?

12:13.966 --> 12:15.900
I can't be runnin' off
     to weddings every day

12:15.968 --> 12:17.735
havin' a good time.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.737
I mean, somebody's gotta
      do the hard, dirty,

12:19.805 --> 12:21.505
thankless little chores
          around here.

12:21.573 --> 12:23.274
Guess who?

12:24.943 --> 12:26.176
Hey, Banta.
                      Yeah, Lou.

12:26.244 --> 12:27.978
I want to talk
to you a minute.

12:28.046 --> 12:29.246
Come over here.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.248
I want to-- I want to ask you
a couple of questions

12:31.316 --> 12:32.283
about the wedding.

12:32.350 --> 12:33.818
Oh, I don't know,
                          Louie.

12:33.885 --> 12:35.886
I feel kind of funny talking
              to you about that.

12:35.954 --> 12:37.154
Why?

12:37.222 --> 12:38.822
Well, what good is
                 it gonna do you

12:38.890 --> 12:41.826
to hear what kind of great
               guy Zena married?

12:43.028 --> 12:44.628
How do you know
he's so great?

12:44.696 --> 12:45.930
We talked at the
                      reception.

12:45.997 --> 12:46.964
And we hit it off.

12:47.032 --> 12:48.465
He was telling me
                    great things

12:48.533 --> 12:50.301
about being a child
                   psychiatrist,

12:50.368 --> 12:53.237
and I was telling him great
            things about being a
               neighborhood guy.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.272
They're real excited about
             where they're going
             on their honeymoon.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.675
Where are they going?

12:57.742 --> 13:02.013
They're taking a cruise
          on the <i>Britannia Star.</i>

13:02.080 --> 13:04.681
They went right from
                  the reception.

13:08.086 --> 13:10.487
I took her on a boat once.

13:12.090 --> 13:15.026
I took her on a ride
around Manhattan.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.030
We made bets

13:19.097 --> 13:22.032
on who would see the most
disgusting things

13:22.100 --> 13:25.035
floating around
in the water.

13:25.103 --> 13:28.039
I let her win.

13:31.142 --> 13:33.076
And now

13:33.144 --> 13:37.081
she's gonna be out there
          on that deck

13:37.149 --> 13:41.085
looking for raw sewage
       with another guy.

13:43.921 --> 13:45.889
(Elaine laughing)

13:45.957 --> 13:47.324
(both laughing)

13:47.391 --> 13:48.993
Oh, are ya happy?

13:49.061 --> 13:50.661
Huh? Are you happy?

13:50.729 --> 13:51.896
Yeah?
JIM:
Yeah.

13:51.963 --> 13:53.897
Yeah, well, be happy
         at your work.

13:53.965 --> 13:55.933
Get up, get dressed
      and get outta here.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.535
What is wrong with you?

13:57.602 --> 13:58.869
Nothing's wrong with me.

13:58.937 --> 14:02.372
I just want to share your joy
      with New York City.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.374
Out, yeah!
         Out, get out!

14:04.442 --> 14:05.543
Go on. Go on.

14:05.610 --> 14:08.045
Here, you, too, Reiger.

14:08.112 --> 14:10.047
TONY: Want me
to help you out?
             Yeah.

14:14.953 --> 14:17.888
You should have been at
            that wedding, Louie.

14:17.956 --> 14:20.458
That was your last chance,
                  you know that?

14:20.525 --> 14:23.127
Your last chance to prove that
  you're a decent human being

14:23.194 --> 14:27.131
and leave Zena with a... with a
loving memory of Louie De Palma.

14:27.198 --> 14:28.799
And you blew it!

14:28.867 --> 14:31.802
You could have shown
                 a little class.

14:31.869 --> 14:33.404
It was important
                         to her.

14:33.472 --> 14:36.073
What the hell good
     would that have done?

14:36.141 --> 14:38.075
What would I have said?
 You could have said anything,

14:38.142 --> 14:39.309
you could have told her
           anything.

14:39.377 --> 14:40.644
You could have told her
           the truth.

14:40.712 --> 14:42.513
You could have said that
  happiness is hard to come by

14:42.581 --> 14:45.249
in this life, and she's given
   you more than your share.

14:45.316 --> 14:47.084
Hey, that's nice.

14:47.151 --> 14:48.653
Thank you.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.789
Nice?

14:51.857 --> 14:54.792
That was beautiful.

14:54.859 --> 14:57.628
"H-Happiness is..." How'd it go?

14:57.696 --> 14:59.230
What?

14:59.297 --> 15:00.931
I-I-I don't... I don't
            remember what I say.

15:00.999 --> 15:02.633
What-what'd you...
what'd you say?
                        Happi...
                 happiness is...

15:02.701 --> 15:06.103
"Happiness is hard to come by
         in this life,

15:06.171 --> 15:09.106
and you've given me more
        than my share."

15:09.173 --> 15:11.742
Yeah, that is nice. Yeah.

15:13.578 --> 15:16.513
That is beautiful...

15:16.581 --> 15:18.515
and classy.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.418
Well, there's
not much point right now.

15:21.486 --> 15:23.754
No, no, no,
         this is great.

15:23.822 --> 15:27.591
H-Happiness is hard to...

15:27.659 --> 15:28.792
To come by
             by...

15:28.860 --> 15:30.327
in this life.
         in this life.

15:30.395 --> 15:33.164
LOUIE AND JEFF:
    And you've given me more
         than my share.

15:33.231 --> 15:34.498
Wow!

15:34.566 --> 15:36.166
What a way to go out!

15:36.234 --> 15:39.503
What a man I'd be to say that.

15:42.874 --> 15:45.309
There's still time, Reiger!

15:45.376 --> 15:46.676
You're right.

15:46.744 --> 15:48.012
You're right.
   What're you talking about?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.480
I should've done the
                   classy thing.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.148
And that's exactly
              what I'm gonna do.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.050
Jeff, you take
                    over for me.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.052
What're you talking about,
      there's still time?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.954
What're you gonna do?
  They're on their honeymoon.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.957
Happiness is hard to come by
         in this life,

16:00.024 --> 16:02.860
and you've given me more
         than my share.

16:02.927 --> 16:04.861
Friendship is a gift of fate,

16:04.929 --> 16:08.665
and I thank the gods
        for sending you.

16:10.702 --> 16:13.036
People who just say "hi"
          in this life

16:13.104 --> 16:14.638
don't know what they're missing.

16:16.741 --> 16:18.675
(cheering, applause)

16:21.379 --> 16:23.313
Oh!
Oh, thought
we'd never get away.

16:23.381 --> 16:24.748
Me, too.
                  (laughs)

16:24.816 --> 16:28.085
But now, finally,
it's just you and me.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.922
So, uh, what do you want
               to do first, huh?

16:31.990 --> 16:34.925
Uh, well, um,

16:34.993 --> 16:37.628
there's, um,
bingo at 7:30.

16:37.696 --> 16:38.662
Uh-huh.

16:38.729 --> 16:40.998
And then, uh,
there's a movie,

16:41.066 --> 16:43.000
<i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>
 at 8:00.
                    (laughs)

16:44.068 --> 16:46.169
Yeah, or uh...

16:46.237 --> 16:48.171
How's that?
This is
a good idea, too.

16:48.239 --> 16:50.174
Mmm.

16:51.476 --> 16:53.910
Don't mind me.

16:53.978 --> 16:56.313
I know how it is
with young marrieds.

16:56.381 --> 16:58.349
What-what are you doing here?

16:58.417 --> 16:59.850
Well, I couldn't
               make the wedding,

16:59.918 --> 17:02.519
so I brought you some
          champers for the trip.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.088
Who are you?

17:04.156 --> 17:06.790
Tom, this is Louie
                       De Palma.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.791
(chuckles)

17:08.859 --> 17:11.561
It's kinda like meetin'
    a legend, isn't it, Tom?

17:13.330 --> 17:17.268
Ah, I understand how
difficult it must be

17:17.335 --> 17:21.271
competing with the ghost
of Louie De Palma.

17:21.339 --> 17:24.340
Louie did this,
Louie said that.

17:25.643 --> 17:27.578
You look great.

17:27.645 --> 17:29.379
But I'm a good loser.

17:29.447 --> 17:32.415
And, uh, I just want
to speak my peace

17:32.483 --> 17:34.418
and get outta here.

17:37.622 --> 17:39.223
Happiness is hard to come by

17:39.291 --> 17:40.457
in this life...
TOM:
You used

17:40.525 --> 17:41.792
to date this man?
                      Yeah.

17:41.859 --> 17:43.961
Yes, a long time ago.

17:47.131 --> 17:51.568
You mean that this is the first
   time my name ever came up?

17:53.171 --> 17:54.604
Oh, I get it.

17:54.672 --> 17:58.575
Oh, that's very
      decent of you, Zena.

17:58.643 --> 18:01.745
To spare old Tom here

18:01.812 --> 18:05.749
the pain of the inevitable
comparison.

18:05.816 --> 18:07.751
(sighs)

18:07.819 --> 18:09.753
You really dated this guy?

18:11.489 --> 18:12.923
Well, what'd you think,

18:12.991 --> 18:15.258
you beat out the governor
 and the president to get her?

18:15.326 --> 18:16.827
This is what you beat out.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.329
Right here, look, this is it.

18:18.396 --> 18:20.164
It was you or this.

18:20.231 --> 18:21.198
(blowing raspberry)

18:21.266 --> 18:22.966
Huh?

18:23.034 --> 18:24.367
We used to go steady.

18:24.435 --> 18:26.069
(blowing raspberry)
                          Oh!

18:26.137 --> 18:27.271
She said she loved me.

18:27.339 --> 18:28.705
(blowing raspberry)
                      That's it!

18:28.773 --> 18:30.040
That's... I'm calli''
               security, and I'm

18:30.107 --> 18:32.042
having him
                     thrown out.
         Oh, no, don't.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.210
It's not necessary.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.812
I know what he's doing.

18:34.879 --> 18:36.480
I understand this man.

18:36.548 --> 18:37.814
Oh, come on.

18:37.882 --> 18:40.651
How can you understand
             someone like Louie?

18:40.719 --> 18:42.486
Honey,
      I'm a psychiatrist.

18:42.554 --> 18:43.987
It's my job.

18:44.055 --> 18:46.790
I'm trained to understand
       deviant behavior.

18:46.858 --> 18:48.425
(grunting)

18:49.527 --> 18:52.295
Louie, can I talk to you
           a minute?

18:53.398 --> 18:55.332
Sit, please.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.208
Now, Louie...

19:04.275 --> 19:07.711
you are not the first man
    who has ever loved and lost.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.045
(grunts): Yeah.

19:09.113 --> 19:11.882
It's a common human
                     experience.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.216
Uh, as a matter
                        of fact,

19:13.284 --> 19:14.884
everything that you've
           done up to this point

19:14.952 --> 19:16.887
was really quite
                         normal.

19:19.190 --> 19:20.390
It was, huh?
                         Mm-hmm.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.893
A lot of men would do
          exactly the same thing

19:22.961 --> 19:24.695
in your position.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.198
You're wonderful.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.267
You mean,

19:30.335 --> 19:32.369
you've seen all this before?

19:32.437 --> 19:35.372
Oh... many times.

19:36.641 --> 19:39.242
You mean, this is nothing new
            to you?

19:39.310 --> 19:40.477
Oh, no, of course not.

19:40.545 --> 19:42.479
Not to me, Lou.

19:42.546 --> 19:44.848
It's not?

19:44.916 --> 19:45.982
How 'bout this?

19:46.050 --> 19:47.985
(growling)
                             Oh!

19:48.052 --> 19:50.019
Like that?
Like that?
               Louie... stop it!

19:50.087 --> 19:51.021
Huh?

19:51.089 --> 19:52.255
You're a psychiatrist.

19:52.323 --> 19:54.257
Why am I doing this, huh?

19:55.793 --> 19:56.960
Huh? Tell me, Doc.
Stop it!

19:57.028 --> 19:58.295
Why do you think
                you're doing it?

19:58.363 --> 20:00.764
I'm doing it
   because I hate your guts.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.333
And because it makes
         me feel good.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.334
Stop it! Just cut it out!
                      That's it!
                      That's it!

20:04.402 --> 20:06.470
Cut it out right now!
                        (groans)

20:06.538 --> 20:08.305
(sighs)

20:08.373 --> 20:10.640
(grunts)

20:10.708 --> 20:12.208
TOM:
                             Oh!

20:12.276 --> 20:13.877
Oh.
              Oh.

20:13.945 --> 20:15.879
Oh.
                         (sighs)

20:17.115 --> 20:19.082
Are you mad at me?

20:19.150 --> 20:20.784
(grunting):
             Louie!

20:22.887 --> 20:25.322
All right,
all right,

20:25.389 --> 20:29.125
I guess... I guess I've gone
too far this time.

20:31.496 --> 20:34.931
And to think, I ran
     all the way over here

20:34.999 --> 20:37.934
just to show a little class.

20:38.002 --> 20:40.938
And what do I do?

20:41.005 --> 20:43.940
I wind up strangling
          your husband

20:44.008 --> 20:46.109
and stealing his watch.

20:46.177 --> 20:47.111
ZENA:
                             Oh!

20:48.212 --> 20:49.913
I'm gonna go.

20:49.981 --> 20:52.916
I'm gonna
get outta your lives.

20:56.254 --> 20:58.188
Tom...

21:00.825 --> 21:03.760
Can I say one last
thing to this woman?

21:05.864 --> 21:07.798
Yeah, sure.

21:10.201 --> 21:12.035
You went with
                       him, huh?

21:19.243 --> 21:23.680
Happiness is hard to come by
in this life...

21:25.416 --> 21:28.351
...and you've given me
more than my share.

21:35.059 --> 21:36.994
That's lovely, Louie.

21:38.095 --> 21:40.798
(mumbling)

21:42.901 --> 21:46.336
I'm telling ya, I sure wish
     this hadn't happened,

21:46.404 --> 21:50.507
but I'm very glad I got
     to hear you say that.

21:50.575 --> 21:52.842
It's a beautiful thing to say.

21:52.910 --> 21:54.844
Thank you.

21:54.912 --> 21:56.847
Thanks.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.850
It's not my line.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.684
That was Reiger's line.

22:04.222 --> 22:05.989
Want to know
how I feel, huh?

22:06.057 --> 22:08.325
Do you want to know
exactly how I feel?

22:08.392 --> 22:11.327
This comes right
from the heart.

22:11.395 --> 22:15.165
The thing that...

22:15.232 --> 22:18.168
that really kills me,

22:18.236 --> 22:20.237
is that...

22:22.239 --> 22:24.708
I'm never gonna do
better than you.

22:26.577 --> 22:29.012
You were the best woman

22:29.080 --> 22:32.482
that I ever had...

22:32.550 --> 22:35.485
and I let you go.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.100
Zena?

22:50.168 --> 22:51.602
Yeah.

22:51.669 --> 22:55.572
Would you do me one last favor?

22:55.640 --> 22:56.506
What?

23:00.378 --> 23:03.847
When you see repulsive things
floating around in the water...

23:05.516 --> 23:07.884
I'll be thinking of you.

23:26.237 --> 23:29.840
(theme song playing)

23:51.996 --> 23:53.463
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:53.531 --> 23:54.797
(man grumbling)
