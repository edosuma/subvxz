WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.220
Don't y'all know the drill by now?

00:12.303 --> 00:13.930
[music playing over speakers]

00:14.973 --> 00:16.975
What if we ordered for him?

00:17.058 --> 00:18.518
-He'll be here.
-[bell dings]

00:18.601 --> 00:21.813
I'm gonna go get that food,
and when I come back,

00:21.896 --> 00:23.440
that seat better be occupied.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.942
[exhales]

00:26.526 --> 00:27.485
Anything?

00:28.403 --> 00:31.239
Can't pick up the tab if he doesn't show.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.619
-You told him here, right?
-He's coming.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.206
Just like your strip-club guy
was moving all that funny money.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.168
And stuff from the councilman's office
was all we'd need.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.085
We're trying.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.213
Sounds like you're trying to go to jail.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.512
-[car approaching]
-[horn toots]

00:56.598 --> 00:57.515
Come here.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.771
-Yo.
-Yo.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.483
-You hungry?
-Nah, I'm good.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.234
Watching your figure?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.653
Yeah. It's hard looking this beautiful.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.280
[both chuckle]

01:12.363 --> 01:14.741
Oh, you're meeting someone more important?

01:15.617 --> 01:16.868
[chuckles softly]

01:16.951 --> 01:19.162
-What's up, though?
-Get in.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.711
Excuse me. Are you Beth Boland?

01:27.712 --> 01:28.630
Yes, I am.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.884
I just voted for you. Good luck today.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.719
Thank you for your support.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.558
[Dave sighs]

01:41.059 --> 01:42.894
You guys, just don't leave yet.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.022
[cell phone buzzing]

01:46.105 --> 01:46.981
You know…

01:48.358 --> 01:50.735
I think I finally figured it out.

01:50.819 --> 01:51.861
What's that?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.155
Why she's got you by the jewels.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.116
-Oh, yeah?
-[chuckling] Yeah.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.118
It's always the spicy ones.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.912
-My kind of girl.
-Yeah, well… [clicks tongue]

02:01.496 --> 02:03.790
-Makes me nervous.
-Don't be.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.669
Well, because when it all goes south,
I need you to be clear-headed.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.587
No, she's just some bitch, bro.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.633
Well, she's more than that.

02:14.717 --> 02:15.718
Hmm?

02:16.719 --> 02:17.554
Come on.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.764
[chuckles] You know me.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.224
[Nick laughs]

02:22.100 --> 02:23.017
Do I?

02:28.106 --> 02:31.276
I'll do what I've got to do. All right?

02:33.903 --> 02:35.613
Let's see how far we can take her. Yeah?

02:35.697 --> 02:38.449
-Drag that bitch till she drops.
-[chuckling] That's right.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.329
Forget lunch. I think you need a boba.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.873
[starts engine]

02:46.207 --> 02:49.210
What, you too cool for boba now?
Put your seat belt on.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.006
Okay, okay. We're going.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.302
[cell phone buzzing]

02:57.385 --> 02:58.386
Yo, is that him?

02:59.971 --> 03:02.891
-Nope, nothing. Oh.
-What's it say?

03:08.396 --> 03:09.397
I won.

03:11.900 --> 03:12.901
[mutters] Oh, boy.

03:14.903 --> 03:15.987
She won.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.115
Seriously?

03:19.198 --> 03:20.491
[music playing over speakers]

03:21.534 --> 03:24.495
-Whiskey for the councilwoman.
-Where were you?

03:24.579 --> 03:25.830
Something came up.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.125
I look like an idiot.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.711
To getting tough on crime.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.797
How am I supposed to do that
if I've got nothing to give them?

03:36.174 --> 03:37.216
Change of plans.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.221
Why?

03:41.304 --> 03:42.513
Too much heat.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.642
Yeah, but the heat's in charge.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.645
Yeah, that don't mean
we have to do it their way.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.275
To keep your hands clean.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.988
-What is it?
-Your acceptance speech.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.326
Break a leg.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.166
[beeps]

04:12.752 --> 04:13.836
[Annie] Dinner!

04:19.842 --> 04:21.010
Huh?

04:21.094 --> 04:25.848
We have steak portobello
with a five cheese mushroom risotto.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.687
Huh?

04:31.312 --> 04:33.815
Is there a problem, sir?
[laughs nervously]

04:34.399 --> 04:36.567
There's ice in the middle.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.697
Oh. I'll just toss it back on the grill.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.199
I'm also cool with just PB on Ritz.

04:43.783 --> 04:50.623
Oh. Well, I just
didn't want you to go into food shock,

04:50.707 --> 04:53.084
since… you know.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.711
I'll survive.

04:55.295 --> 04:59.299
I don't know.
You guys were just, uh, pretty close.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.383
We still are.

05:02.051 --> 05:05.179
-What do you mean?
-He's been helping out at my practices.

05:05.972 --> 05:06.806
He has?

05:06.889 --> 05:08.141
Yeah. He and my coach found out

05:08.224 --> 05:10.476
they used to play
against each other in college.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.354
Does he ever… you know, like, just

05:14.689 --> 05:16.816
ask about me, or is it…

05:16.899 --> 05:17.775
Mom?

05:17.859 --> 05:19.360
-[microwave beeps]
-Hmm?

05:20.570 --> 05:21.738
You'll survive, too.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.622
[sighs]

05:32.665 --> 05:34.500
Mushrooms all exploded.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.509
[Dean] Congratulations.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.432
They didn't have any patriotic options.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.309
-Tastes the same.
-Hmm.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.813
So, do you want to run your speech?

05:55.897 --> 05:57.565
I'm still working on it.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.817
Well, if you change your mind,

05:59.901 --> 06:03.654
I will be in… the garage.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.116
What are you doing in the garage?

06:08.826 --> 06:09.786
Cleaning up.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.896
Hey, ladies.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.064
[chuckles nervously]

06:38.147 --> 06:40.358
We got a family meeting or…

06:41.901 --> 06:43.152
lovers' quarrel?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.195
[both chuckle]

06:44.278 --> 06:45.822
No, man, we just want to talk.

06:46.781 --> 06:50.201
-Shoot.
-I need you to leave my wife out of this.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.540
-Why?
-What do you mean, "Why?"

06:56.415 --> 06:58.709
-Well, isn't she the problem?
-[Dean] Not yours.

06:59.585 --> 07:03.172
Well, she's the reason
that you two are such… losers.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.759
No, no. You're not gonna do that
Harry Potter mind spell on us.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.182
Hey, look. Everyone benefits from it.
She's gonna help grow the company.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.351
Yeah, I don't,
I don't think you're hearing me.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.649
All right.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.529
Leave my wife out of this.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.157
-No, I got that part, yeah.
-Then don't be stupid.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.702
Or what?

07:34.912 --> 07:37.331
-You don't want me to make you understand.
-[Vance sighs]

07:38.791 --> 07:41.294
You think a guy my size
hasn't taken a few punches?

07:41.377 --> 07:43.504
Ain't nobody talking about punches.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.799
I've been stuffed into lockers, dumpsters…

07:46.883 --> 07:48.885
At camp, I was lit on fire.

07:48.968 --> 07:52.638
Yeah, you ever see a dog rag doll
a stuffed animal? You ever seen that?

07:52.722 --> 07:53.639
[laughs]

07:55.391 --> 07:56.434
You think that's funny?

07:56.517 --> 07:58.311
[mumbles] Uh, the thing…

08:03.232 --> 08:04.233
There you go.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.528
-Take it.
-What for?

08:08.905 --> 08:11.866
'Cause the only way
you're gonna shut me up is to kill me.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.463
[Beth] I am honored
to have this opportunity.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.967
Uh, thank you to my husband, Dean,
for his tireless support.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.471
And thank you
to all my supporters and my volunteers.

08:34.055 --> 08:37.767
I made a promise to this city
to reduce crime in our community,

08:37.850 --> 08:39.185
and I do plan to deliver.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.897
But I can't do it alone.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.901
I'm gonna need your help.
We're all gonna have to do our part.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.948
And together,
we can heal our city of this disease.

08:53.074 --> 08:56.285
Councilwoman, can you speak to
the corruption in your own backyard?

08:57.995 --> 09:00.498
Uh, I'm don't… I'm sorry,
I don't understand the question.

09:00.581 --> 09:03.668
Can you comment on
the allegations that Councilman Martín

09:03.751 --> 09:06.462
uses city projects
for kickbacks and money laundering?

09:06.546 --> 09:09.674
I have only known the councilman to be

09:09.757 --> 09:12.718
honest and loyal
to the people of Ashfield.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.681
<i>But if there is any impropriety here,</i>

09:16.764 --> 09:21.143
<i>I will exhaust every resource</i>
<i>to maintain the community's trust.</i>

09:21.227 --> 09:22.228
You can turn it off now.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.980
[phone ringing]

09:31.153 --> 09:31.988
Yeah?

09:32.071 --> 09:34.031
[assistant] <i>I've got</i> Detroit News
<i>on line one.</i>

09:34.949 --> 09:36.033
Tell them no comment.

09:36.117 --> 09:41.247
<i>Uh, what about</i> Oakland Press, Freep,
<i>Action News 7, WDTV </i>and <i>Fox 2?</i>

09:41.330 --> 09:42.832
<i>They're all on hold, too.</i>

09:44.417 --> 09:45.418
<i>Hello?</i>

09:48.671 --> 09:51.090
I'll let the councilman speak for himself.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.633
[reporter] Councilwoman, question.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.303
-Thank you. No more questions.
-[reporters clamoring]

09:58.097 --> 10:00.808
I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.603
That's why we're here.

10:05.313 --> 10:09.692
-Well, ask away. I'm an open book.
-Are you sure you don't want a lawyer?

10:10.901 --> 10:13.696
-I've got nothing to hide.
-[Dave] All right. [sighs]

10:13.779 --> 10:15.781
Explain to us how we got it wrong.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.660
Are you guys close to your families?

10:20.369 --> 10:23.789
-Only on holidays.
-I talk to my mom twice a day.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.626
Forget you. But you get it.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.254
You grow up with someone,
you've got your blinders on.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.798
You want to believe they can do no wrong.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.258
So, this is all on him?

10:36.093 --> 10:40.473
Look. Did I know that he was
running with the wrong crowd? Sure.

10:41.015 --> 10:45.227
Did I know he would use my position
to line his pockets? Absolutely not.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.565
But his name isn't on any of this.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.611
-Hey, you're welcome to take a look.
-We know yours isn't either.

10:54.945 --> 10:59.325
Then… aren't you
sitting in front of the wrong person?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.661
[inhales] Okay.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.121
Maybe you can help us, then.

11:05.247 --> 11:09.168
Why is all the money in question held up
in companies run by your grandmother?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.589
He, um…

11:16.175 --> 11:17.802
He must have set it up this way.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.346
Then you should really get <i>her</i> a lawyer.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.973
'Cause this is either on you or grandma.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.225
[Dave] Your choice.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.519
Good news is,
she won't serve that much time.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.604
-Why?
-[Phoebe] What is she, a hundred?

11:28.687 --> 11:31.190
She'll croak
long before the sentence is done.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.026
Um…

11:36.612 --> 11:38.072
Why can't it be him?

11:39.115 --> 11:41.242
'Cause he's got something you don't.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.328
What's that?

11:45.746 --> 11:47.289
[music playing in background]

11:47.373 --> 11:48.958
[Annie] Can you talk to my landlord?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.837
-About what?
-You know, lowering my rent.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.673
What do you think?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.634
What about a disabled parking permit?

11:58.717 --> 11:59.885
Are you disabled?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.096
She has one.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.975
-I was shot.
-Being a ding-dong doesn't count.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.979
What's the point of all your new power
if we can't get something out of it?

12:10.062 --> 12:13.232
How about not drawing any more attention
to ourselves before we get out of here?

12:15.609 --> 12:17.069
-Where we at?
-[Beth] Okay.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.905
-Now I've lost my place.
-Just ballpark it.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.490
Well…

12:22.241 --> 12:25.828
Between the club, the trips to Canada,

12:26.495 --> 12:28.414
and what's left from the purses…

12:31.000 --> 12:32.376
it looks, um…

12:35.004 --> 12:35.838
good.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.508
How good?

12:42.803 --> 12:43.679
Good enough.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.144
[Brian] Fine. Who's yours?

12:50.227 --> 12:52.480
-[Cory] Evel Knievel.
-[Brian] No way, dude.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.689
[Cory] Do the math.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.150
Anybody can hurl themselves
over a bunch of cars

12:56.233 --> 12:57.693
and break every bone in their body.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.945
-[whispers] But they didn't.
-'Cause it wasn't a sport.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.406
Until he invented it. Anyone can box.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.618
Where is he?

13:05.701 --> 13:08.621
[Cory] I don't know,
but I've never known him to be late.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.124
Know where Vance is?

13:14.168 --> 13:15.294
No, man.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.466
[Vance] Hey, guys.

13:24.094 --> 13:28.557
Sorry about that, but something big
just rolled in from corporate.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.725
[Brian] Sweet.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.186
We are getting in to hair care.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.354
-[Cory] Yes.
-Huh?

13:33.437 --> 13:35.898
Now, we need someone smart
to spearhead this.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.984
We'll get through it.

31:02.318 --> 31:05.697
-Our insurance hasn't kicked in.
-Oh, my God.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.157
-We'll get through it.
-Will you stop saying that?

31:08.241 --> 31:09.284
How?

31:11.911 --> 31:13.121
I've been knitting.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.632
[Annie] All right!
Hands where I can see them!

31:24.716 --> 31:25.800
[people screaming]

31:25.884 --> 31:29.387
Nobody move!
Just be cool and nobody gets hurt.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.265
Right, you, come on. Let's go! Open it up!

31:32.348 --> 31:34.642
-[Ruby] Open it up.
-[Beth] Put it in, nice and easy.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.644
-[Annie] You know what to do.
-Nice and easy.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.438
-[Annie] More. Quick!
-Open those up.

31:38.521 --> 31:39.772
-[Annie] All right.
-Look down.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.691
-[Annie] You next!
-[Beth] Open that drawer.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.318
-[Annie] Get it in there.
-Time?

31:43.401 --> 31:44.611
[Annie] Where's the manager?

31:44.694 --> 31:47.488
-[Ruby] Three minutes.
-Get the video feed. Look away.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.782
-Where's the manager at?
-[Ruby] It's this guy.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.409
All right, come on. Let's go.

31:51.492 --> 31:52.952
-[Ruby] Let's go!
-To the back!

31:53.036 --> 31:54.954
-[Ruby] What's going on?
-[Annie] Let's go!

31:55.038 --> 31:56.831
-[Ruby] Bro. Let's go!
-[Annie] Come on!

31:56.915 --> 31:58.333

32:02.629 --> 32:04.297
-[clamoring]
-[Annie] Beth! Do something!

32:04.380 --> 32:05.757
Beth, are you all right?

32:06.257 --> 32:09.010
Call an ambulance! Someone do something!

32:09.093 --> 32:13.056
Wake up! Somebody! No!

32:13.640 --> 32:18.102
Please help! Beth, stay with me. Please…

32:18.853 --> 32:22.357
Beth! Please.
Someone do something! Beth, please.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.692
Beth! Do something!

32:26.819 --> 32:28.321
[Ruby crying]

32:34.160 --> 32:35.662

Please! Do something!

32:38.790 --> 32:41.250
Beth! No!

32:50.969 --> 32:53.346
[Annie] Beth, please, come on, wake up!

32:53.429 --> 32:55.306
Can't run from who you are, Beth.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.851
-[Annie] No!
-How many times have I told you that?

32:58.935 --> 33:01.521
[Annie] Beth!
Beth, are you alive? Come back!

33:01.604 --> 33:05.817
How many? How many?

33:20.164 --> 33:21.749
How many fingers am I holding up?

33:23.584 --> 33:24.669
Two.

33:27.463 --> 33:31.217
-Where are the kids?
-Neighbors. They're okay. Hey.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.636
You're gonna be okay.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.306
[cop] Can you tell us who shot you?

33:44.147 --> 33:44.981
Go ahead.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.030
Ah…

33:52.613 --> 33:53.698
Beth.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.326
It, um…

34:00.413 --> 34:01.497
happened so fast.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.082
Tell him.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.419
Who did this, ma'am?

34:16.554 --> 34:17.847
I don't know.

34:36.616 --> 34:37.617
[Annie] What?

34:39.994 --> 34:41.370
Do you not like the flowers?

34:42.288 --> 34:43.623
They were on sale.

34:48.169 --> 34:49.879
I'm not going to Nevada.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.384
We can get you other flowers.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.765
Nothing will be different.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.311
Except you won't be a criminal.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.569
Exactly.

35:17.782 --> 35:22.078
But what about the part where you
don't have to live in fear for your life?

35:22.161 --> 35:24.622
'Cause that's pretty enticing.

35:24.705 --> 35:27.333
-He just grazed me.
-You got shot.

35:28.126 --> 35:32.964
-You are extremely lucky that he missed.
-What if it wasn't luck?

35:36.425 --> 35:38.845
You guys, he left his gun behind.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.185
[buzzer sounds]

35:46.269 --> 35:47.645
Must feel like a boss.

35:48.604 --> 35:52.525
Nah. Nah, man, it just feels right.

35:54.527 --> 35:57.530
-You know none of it's gonna stick.
-Not without me.

36:01.951 --> 36:03.953
[exhales] You know, crazy thing is…

36:05.037 --> 36:06.205
I don't blame you.

36:06.873 --> 36:10.835
Don't matter who you try to put this on.
You're gonna leave her be.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.089
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.342
And don't be
using my people for your dirty work.

36:18.426 --> 36:21.387
-[Nick] He's on my payroll.
-Not anymore.

36:21.929 --> 36:22.972
[Nick sniffs]

36:25.433 --> 36:27.351
[inhales deeply]

36:27.435 --> 36:29.896
No, there's nothing more
I can do to her, anyway.

36:29.979 --> 36:32.773
Yeah? Should have finished the job.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.568
I did.

36:36.485 --> 36:37.528
How so?

36:40.615 --> 36:44.535
I… I took your advice.
Hit her where it hurts.

36:45.786 --> 36:46.996
Remember?

36:53.002 --> 36:55.796
What if it's… that gun?

36:56.964 --> 37:02.803
Except why shoot me
with a gun with my prints on it?

37:07.850 --> 37:09.393
[Phoebe] <i>Her prints are all over it.</i>

37:14.440 --> 37:17.360
-Sibling rivalry?
-Way more than that.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.571
Not the only time it was used.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.367
Jesus.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.578
So, what do we do?

37:30.790 --> 37:32.291
It's not our case.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.179
[Ben] You bought an RV?

37:46.305 --> 37:47.139
Yeah.

37:48.015 --> 37:50.559
-Does Dad know?
-[Annie] Not yet.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.311
Benjamin was freaking out about school.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.189
[Ben] But then, I was like
why don't we go cross-country for summer,

37:55.273 --> 37:58.025
and I can be with Dad for school,
and fly back for Thanksgiving?

37:58.109 --> 38:00.403
[Kevin] Ooh. We should do
a college tour on the way.

38:00.486 --> 38:03.030
-[Ben] I want to see Oberlin.
-You're going to Maryland.

38:03.114 --> 38:03.990
Guys.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.621
Um…

38:11.205 --> 38:12.623
I may not be able to go.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.920
-What?
-Why?

38:21.132 --> 38:24.010
Uh, I'm actually
in a little bit of trouble.

38:27.513 --> 38:32.310
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Check this out.
Three bedrooms, two baths, central air…

38:32.393 --> 38:35.521
-'Cause we're gonna need that out there.
-Stanley.

38:44.739 --> 38:45.740
Let me guess.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.326
I can't leave her like this.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.245
This was your idea.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.623
Maybe we can go
once everything blows over.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.711
[breathes deeply]

39:04.175 --> 39:05.968
Or maybe you can just join us.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.180
What do you mean?

39:09.263 --> 39:10.222
When you decide.

39:12.308 --> 39:15.227
-Decide what?
-Which family you want to be with.

39:19.857 --> 39:23.527
-Don't do this.
-I already put the application in.

39:24.653 --> 39:29.200
-Why can't we just wait?
-The longer we wait, the worse it gets.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.637
We just can't do it anymore.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.598
I know.
