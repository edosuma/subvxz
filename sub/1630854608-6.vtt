Jesus.

34:16.764 --> 34:19.266
[Petr] The explosion is
all that was needed.

34:19.349 --> 34:21.685
What is done cannot be undone.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.565
And I am the arrogant one, hmm?

34:26.648 --> 34:28.776
This mantle you carry

34:28.859 --> 34:31.028
will die with you, Lebedev.

34:31.111 --> 34:32.863
I have only lit the match.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.532
Others... will stoke the flame.

34:36.700 --> 34:39.286
Russia has become
a small country

34:39.369 --> 34:40.996
ruled by small men.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.081
But the fire is growing.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.835
Even you cannot stop it.

34:46.919 --> 34:49.004
[laughs]

34:49.087 --> 34:51.048
Not even me, hmm?

34:52.758 --> 34:54.468
Don't you think I know

34:54.551 --> 34:56.220
about Crossbow?

35:09.650 --> 35:12.194
[men grunting]

35:22.871 --> 35:24.873
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:39.137 --> 35:40.556
Ma'am.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.062
[soldiers shouting]

35:56.238 --> 35:57.990
I'm Luka Gocharov.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.075
- I've been working with...
- I know who you are.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.413
He left me with no choice.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.665
His artery is severed.

36:06.748 --> 36:09.126
This will hold
till you get him to a hospital.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.591
I would like the room, please.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.933
I knew you'd come.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.276
Everything.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.236
All of it, my entire life.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.696
It was all a lie.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.157
Not everything.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.492
Don't you dare.

36:42.576 --> 36:45.579
Don't you dare say you loved me.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.831
You...

36:47.915 --> 36:50.542
You were unexpected.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.712
You...

36:53.795 --> 36:56.715
brought joy
where there was none.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.934
I was nothing more
than a puppet.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.566
My desk.

37:14.650 --> 37:16.652
For you.

37:34.711 --> 37:37.839
You don't understand now.

37:39.174 --> 37:42.010
But, one day, you will.

37:45.889 --> 37:48.141
No. I don't think so.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.106
You're done manipulating me.

37:57.317 --> 38:00.153

[indistinct radio chatter]

39:08.847 --> 39:11.475
We got a change of plans.

[exhales]

39:32.329 --> 39:34.331
[footsteps approaching]

39:43.590 --> 39:45.592
He didn't make it.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.068
Are they expecting a briefing?

40:03.151 --> 40:05.946
They know as much
as we do at this point, sir.

40:06.029 --> 40:07.405
He's read in.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.032
Not to this, sir.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.830
[overlapping conversations]

40:14.913 --> 40:16.331
[Ramos] As far as we know,
there's been

40:16.414 --> 40:17.874
no loss of life
outside the driver.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.334
But I don't need to tell you,

40:19.417 --> 40:20.669
it could have been a lot worse.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.420
[Miller] Yes, our teams
are assessing the extent

40:22.504 --> 40:24.089
- of the radiological...
- [Fleming] Damn it,
Tom, will you pipe down?

40:24.172 --> 40:25.966
I'm trying to figure out
how the hell

40:26.049 --> 40:27.425
we didn't know
what was going on over there.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.511
Actually, we did, sir.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.600
This is a paramilitary team

40:35.684 --> 40:37.394
entering
the U.S. Embassy in Prague.

40:37.477 --> 40:40.147
Not under the cover
of law enforcement,

40:40.230 --> 40:42.065
but rather
under the personal direction

40:42.149 --> 40:44.442
of CIA Director Miller

40:44.526 --> 40:46.987
to rendition one of our own.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.700
[Hutchins] Wait a minute,
what the hell is this?

40:51.783 --> 40:53.785
- I didn't authorize this.
- With all due respect, sir...

40:53.869 --> 40:55.912
- You knew about this?
- Officer Ryan...

40:55.996 --> 40:57.497
Is the only one who knows
what's going on out there.

40:57.581 --> 40:58.748
And instead of being supported,

40:58.832 --> 41:00.876
he's been pursued
by this office.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.711
My apologies,
Mr. Vice President.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.254
There was an issue
with my credentials.

41:04.337 --> 41:07.757
Are you saying today's events
could have been averted?

41:07.841 --> 41:09.676
No, sir. I'm saying
that if the agency had his back

41:09.759 --> 41:11.928
from the beginning, today's
events would have been averted.

41:12.012 --> 41:13.889
[sighs] Bring Ryan in.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.183
Make sure he has
everything he needs.

41:16.266 --> 41:17.809
You're running the show
from here on out.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.895
Yes, sir.

41:40.290 --> 41:42.209
For a second there,
I thought we lost you.

41:42.292 --> 41:44.211
I'm sorry to disappoint.

41:44.294 --> 41:46.379
- Good to see you, brother.
- Uh-huh.

41:46.463 --> 41:48.131
So what are the odds
this is a one-way trip?

41:48.215 --> 41:50.467
80... 90%?

41:50.550 --> 41:52.844
At least my last flight
won't be in coach.

42:01.770 --> 42:03.730
So are we clear to fly?

42:03.813 --> 42:06.775
The manifest has us listed
as a diplomatic entourage.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.153
Madam President.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.406
That was very brave,
what you did.

42:16.493 --> 42:18.119
Well, we got lucky.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.538
Let's hope our luck doesn't
run out in Moscow.

42:20.622 --> 42:23.250
Careful with that one.

42:23.333 --> 42:26.419
We can't be too certain
he isn't playing both sides.

42:27.963 --> 42:30.048
I assume everyone is
playing both sides,

42:30.131 --> 42:32.467
Officer Greer.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.552
[Mike] Madam President.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.186
Well done.

42:43.270 --> 42:45.522
"Well done"?

42:45.605 --> 42:47.816
If we hadn't stopped that truck,
tens of thousands

42:47.899 --> 42:49.651
of people are dead.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.569
But you did.

42:53.154 --> 42:55.240
I don't really understand you.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.575
You could have stopped
all of it in Matoksa.

42:57.659 --> 43:00.036
Not all of it.

43:00.120 --> 43:02.455
What does that mean?

43:02.539 --> 43:04.708
NATO moving nuclear material

43:04.791 --> 43:07.794
in violation
of international law.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.588
That was the final escalation.

43:11.631 --> 43:14.009
Are you talking
about a full-scale war?

43:14.092 --> 43:16.428
Now you know what
the Russians' response will be.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.223
And what's our response?

43:20.307 --> 43:22.225
'Cause I don't have anything.

43:22.309 --> 43:24.352
No plans, no leads, nothing.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.564
You have me.
