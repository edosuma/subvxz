JOHN: We/l, theoretical/y,
Connaver’s device

has been on Arkyn,

that radiation signature.

isn't visible to the eye,

14:06.138 --> 14:09.050

will translate it into
something you can see.

is actually here.

ifyou returned
her calls,

she wouldn't have
to keep calling.

if she stopped treating
our couch like a guest room,

I wouldn't have to
keep avoiding her.

told me your name.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.845
It's Clara.
What happened
to you, Clara?

23:53.808 --> 23:56.390
Connavers won me in trade
for a debt a few years ago.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.926

need to get onto Arkyn.

get the shield?

24:11.659 --> 24:12.694
They found it.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.530
On a crashed ship
they tracked leaving Arkyn.

24:16.873 --> 24:19.956
they needed a way
to keep it portable
and safe, so...

24:20.043 --> 24:23.285
They stuck it in me,
took my arm, and gave me Alice
so I could protect it.

24:23.379 --> 24:24.459
You should've
killed them with her.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.125

I can't.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.251

24:28.343 --> 24:30.880
I so much as
raise her at them,
I get 500 volts to my brain

24:30.970 --> 24:32.346
and take one hell of a nap.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.554

it cloaks the ship.

24:48.738 --> 24:49.727

Besides,
we had a deal.

over with.

No rush.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.580
Get some rest,
and we'll let you know
when we're ready.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.790
What do you mean,
"No rush"?

25:06.881 --> 25:09.247

killing your brother
right now.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.045
So, we're not gonna
talk at all about
your people flooding you

25:15.139 --> 25:17.801

That would be
my preference.

Brought you here
to make you a Level Six.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.145
Apparently, it didn't work.
I need to know why.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.188
But why me?

25:26.275 --> 25:28.607
Send you back to Yala
a Level Six loyal to me.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.362
To spy on her?
To protect her
if she listens to you.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.563
She doesn't listen
to me anymore.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.445
You know you have some
pretty serious daddy issues
with her.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.696
It's pretty creepy.
Stop talking.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.243
Because I'm right?

25:40.289 --> 25:43.531
So I don't shoot you,
repeatedly.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.166
And put my fist
through the wounds.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.626
Well, that was
oddly specific.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.130
Is she okay?
The gunshot's
not the problem.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.927
Sternum plate
took most of the hit.
It's the radiation.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.140
What radiation?

25:58.224 --> 25:59.930
She has a shield.
No. No, no.

26:00.017 --> 26:04.226
She is the shield.
It's like she absorbs the
radiation for everyone else

26:04.313 --> 26:05.928
every time she passes
in and out ofArkyn.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.185
There's old burns
all around the tech.

26:08.276 --> 26:10.062
Dutch, that thing's
gotta be killing her
byinches.

26:10.153 --> 26:12.018
I mean, really
shitty inches.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.440
Then get it
out of her.
I can't.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.817
Connaver assholes
have rigged it to blow
if it's tampered with.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.024
(SIGHS)

26:20.329 --> 26:22.160
Then what's our
alternative, John?

26:22.874 --> 26:24.785
You know, I'm trying
to be Positive Guy,

26:25.501 --> 26:27.708
Mr. Glass Half Full,
but I think I've run out
ofglass.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.828
He would never
have even met him
if it wasn't for me.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.753
Ifl need to drag D'av
back from hell, Iwill.

26:31.841 --> 26:34.378
The last time Khlyen
went after someone
you cared about,

26:34.469 --> 26:35.584
he murdered your husband.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.177
I don't want platitudes.

26:39.974 --> 26:41.680
ljust want
my brother back.

26:41.768 --> 26:42.974
CLARA: Who's Khlyen?

26:43.478 --> 26:44.513
Open.

26:48.691 --> 26:49.806
Sorry.

26:49.901 --> 26:52.233
Bionic ears.
Did I not mention?

26:52.361 --> 26:55.524
You should be resting.
So, answer my question
anleIgo.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.698
It's kind of
a dark story.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.195
Remember the part
where I was kidnapped

27:00.286 --> 27:01.947
by a gang of thieves
who cut off my arm

27:02.038 --> 27:04.154
and made me
their robo-slave-girl?

27:06.918 --> 27:08.328
Point taken.

27:09.921 --> 27:13.209
Khlyen trained me
to be an assassin.

27:14.008 --> 27:16.044
Starting from
when I was a child.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.423
I finally broke away
six years ago,
thanks to Johnny.

27:19.931 --> 27:21.137
CLARA: But he
found you again.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.135
Well, he's a bit
of a stalker.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.183
He's got my brother.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.555
That's the guy on Arkyn?

27:28.815 --> 27:29.804
Yeah.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.311
So, Khlyen is
your Connaver?

27:34.237 --> 27:35.727
I guess so, yeah.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.482
Okay. I'm in.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.658
Let's go mess
his shit up.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.157
Clara, Johnny said
the shield damages you.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.363
This isn't your fight.

27:46.457 --> 27:47.742
None of them
were my fight.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.950
But this time,
I get to choose.

27:51.170 --> 27:55.504
Look, I had family
once, too. Brothers.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.048
You know what they did
when the Connavers
came to take me?

27:58.177 --> 28:00.384
Nothing.
I wish they'd come
and rescued me,

28:00.471 --> 28:02.803
but you're the ones who did,
so we're doing this.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.005
And then we're even.

28:06.727 --> 28:09.764
Ifleverﬁnd
the Factory again,
you two can ride shotgun.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.973
Help me burn that shit
to the ground.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.391
I'll do that one
for free.

28:15.778 --> 28:16.733
Pree!

28:16.821 --> 28:17.901
I'm driving, nerd.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.647
Right... Okay.

28:21.826 --> 28:22.815
Uh...

28:23.619 --> 28:24.699
Be gentle.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.573
Uh... Tell Lucy
what you need.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.154
We don't need words.
Do we, girl?

28:28.249 --> 28:29.864
LUCY: Initiating nexus.

28:31.294 --> 28:32.454
Hello, Clara.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.376
All right.
Take us in.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.249
How long
until the shield...
Hold on.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.826
(SIGHS) Still with us?
Yeah.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.242
Lucy's grabbed
an outbound signal.

29:11.334 --> 29:12.414
I think that's where
we should head.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.287
Johnny, patches off.
No IDs.

29:15.838 --> 29:16.873
(CLARA COUGHING)

29:16.964 --> 29:17.999
Hey.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.001
You okay?
Yeah.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.545
(PANTING) Hey. Dummy.

29:22.637 --> 29:24.923
A big, beautiful ship
just landed on
their front lawn.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.256
Go get your brother
before they notice.

29:28.351 --> 29:29.682
I'll stay with her.
Go.

29:30.478 --> 29:32.218
DUTCH: Lucy,
take care of Clara.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.099
Fry anyone
who comes close.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.600
LUCY: Understood.

29:36.442 --> 29:37.602
Sweetie.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.854
Right back
with a cold compress.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.937
And a giant glass
of Hokk. Hmm?

29:43.199 --> 29:45.110
LUCY: Thank you
for the compliment, Clara.

29:45.201 --> 29:46.657
You are also attractive.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.905
(CHUCKLES)
For a human.

29:59.382 --> 30:01.293
D'AVIN: Strange time
for a manicure.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.215
KHLYEN: I'm connecting
with the base system.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.760
That's some multi-tasking
green shit you got there.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.178
You have no idea.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.057
There.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.895
All traces of you
are gone.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.148
Happy?

30:23.239 --> 30:25.150
Oh, this is definitely
my happy face.

30:29.912 --> 30:31.903
I saw that symbol.
In my dreams.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.114
That wasn't a dream.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.914
It's a very old memory.

30:36.002 --> 30:36.991
It's part of the process.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.075
Whose memory?

30:39.588 --> 30:40.577
(GROANS)

30:40.673 --> 30:41.662
(GROANS)

30:48.681 --> 30:50.717
Being a Six
has its advantages.

RED 17 VOICE:
Protocol H. Protocol H.

30:56.230 --> 30:57.970
We're out of time.
The Black Root is here.

30:58.065 --> 30:59.054
"Black Root"?

31:02.403 --> 31:04.064
Would you die for her?

31:08.284 --> 31:10.570
For Dutch and Johnny.

31:10.661 --> 31:11.821
If that's what it takes.

31:11.912 --> 31:12.992
Good.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.537
Do it another day.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.873
(GRUNTING)

31:19.295 --> 31:20.831
Yala is on her way to you.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.253
Find her and get her
away from Arkyn.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.546
I'll deal with
the Black Root.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.045
If she thinks you're here,
she won't leave
until she finds you.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.047
Then do what
I've always done.

31:30.181 --> 31:31.421
Lie to her.

31:51.994 --> 31:53.074
Fancy?

32:01.337 --> 32:02.417
Hey. You okay?

32:02.755 --> 32:04.245
Have you seen D'avin?
No.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.797
Is he here?
You got to get him out.

to meet you, sir.

Enough, I can't breathe.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.271
Sorry.

33:02.773 --> 33:04.809
What happened
to your leg?
Long story.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.185
Longer fall.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.434
Took you long enough.
(LAUGHS)

33:08.529 --> 33:09.644
Come on,
we had to hide Lucy,

33:09.738 --> 33:10.864
but she's just
over the next rise.

33:10.948 --> 33:13.314
You and Fancy stay with him.
I have to look for Khlyen.

33:13.409 --> 33:14.774
Wait.
He's gone.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.071
He's gone.

33:17.163 --> 33:18.949

nothing there but death.

wide open out here.

all over hell for you.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.606
Well, hell is where
you found me.
It's good to be home.

Hey, Fancy,
they get you
with that green shit?

before they had a chance.

Only way to know.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.354
Okay, but you're sure?

34:34.448 --> 34:35.688
Oh, for God's sake...

34:36.825 --> 34:39.487
(GROANS)
There. Done. You're welcome.
Now hurry up and bleed.

Whoo!

Still a bleeder,
not a healer.

Praise the trees
and pass the Hokk.

Look, we have to
get to Old Town,

35:03.686 --> 35:05.347
have Pawter check me
out for real.

35:08.691 --> 35:10.022
What'd I say?

35:13.112 --> 35:14.943
Is that a...
JOHN: Containment fence.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.942
All around Old Town.
Sealed in the riots
and the citizens.

35:18.033 --> 35:21.116
No communication,
no one in or out.

35:21.203 --> 35:24.036
No idea who made it
through the bombing alive.

35:25.291 --> 35:28.533
Shit, Pree.
I'm so sorry.

35:28.836 --> 35:30.701
Me too, sweetie.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.003
But no one's
giving up hope yet.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.505

some fight in her.

Good, 'cause now that
we're a whole team again,

35:39.013 --> 35:40.799
that's our next mission.

35:41.598 --> 35:46.217
Getting into Old Town.
Getting Pawter and Alvis out.

36:01.744 --> 36:04.486
I'm not stealing.
I'm borrowing.

36:05.205 --> 36:06.615
I'll send it all back.

36:07.791 --> 36:12.125
Okay, but that is my bag
and my favorite socket wrench.

you don't have to go.

36:18.469 --> 36:19.834
You could
stay here with us.
Don't.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.715
You've seen what I am,
John Jaqobis.

36:22.806 --> 36:25.092
I'm more than
26% modified.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.386
That's illegal
in the Quad.

36:27.478 --> 36:30.060
I'm not even a person here
under Company law.

36:30.147 --> 36:31.557
You still need help.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.980
Things I can't fix.
I know.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.810
I have a doctor friend,
a Qreshi.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.445
La-di-da.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.521

36:41.992 --> 36:44.574
Look, she's in Old Town.
That's where
we're headed next.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.157
And Pawter's good people.
I know that she would help.

36:48.457 --> 36:49.697
Help with what?

36:49.792 --> 36:52.033
Strip my mods,
make me a basic again?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.122
That's what you call us?

36:55.839 --> 36:57.500
"Basics"?
Little bit.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.177
Your mods
are hurting you.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.470
The Connavers
hurt me.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.218
My mods are me.

37:08.143 --> 37:11.761
I was changed
for other people once.
I'm not doing it again.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.396
DUTCH:So,$tMs
goodbyethen?

37:16.485 --> 37:17.770
You tell me.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.365
I heard you talking.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.816
I know you have
a warrant for the shield.

37:25.494 --> 37:27.906
You know I'd give it
to you, but...
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

37:32.793 --> 37:34.658
So, are you gonna
let me leave with it?

37:41.510 --> 37:42.716
Well...

37:44.096 --> 37:45.802
I'm a stickler
for wording.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.892
"Level III Warrant,

"in illegal possession
of the aforementioned shield."

38:00.362 --> 38:02.318
You're not a person
by Company's own rule.

38:03.657 --> 38:05.443
So our warrant
can't apply to you.

38:09.246 --> 38:11.111
You didn't hear this
from me, but...

38:11.957 --> 38:14.198
I think Alice has
a sudden crush on you.

38:15.711 --> 38:17.292
Then you tell her
it's mutual.

a friend at the bazaar

38:22.092 --> 38:23.832
who can help smuggle
you out of the Quad.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.007
I'll take you.

38:26.680 --> 38:27.795
Lucy?

38:28.599 --> 38:30.135
You take care
of your people.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.181
If they ever
need me and Alice,
you got my numbers?

38:32.269 --> 38:34.260
LUCY: Affirmative.
Signal locked.

38:39.193 --> 38:41.024
I'm glad you got
your brother back.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.397
Johnny Jaqobis.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.949
LUCY: / like that one, John.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.746
Can’t we keep her?

38:54.833 --> 38:56.414
That's not
how it works, Luce.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.952
That's not even
a little bit how it works.

39:10.933 --> 39:11.922
Thanks.

39:26.865 --> 39:30.198
D'AVIN: I lied to you
about Khlyen.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.367
He was still there
on the base.

39:33.830 --> 39:34.819
I know.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.959
Then why did you
leave with me?

39:41.588 --> 39:42.964
'Cause you all
needed me to.

39:44.216 --> 39:47.379
He took you away once.
He turned Fancy
into a Level Six.

39:47.970 --> 39:49.460
Who's next?

39:50.138 --> 39:51.298
Johnny?

39:51.807 --> 39:52.796
Me?

39:58.981 --> 40:00.937
I don't think
Khlyen's your enemy.

40:02.776 --> 40:04.732
I don't think
you get a say in that.

40:04.820 --> 40:07.983
Dutch, he sacrificed himself,
turned on his own people

40:08.073 --> 40:10.189
to make sure
we got away.

40:10.284 --> 40:11.865
Why would he do that?

40:13.996 --> 40:15.611
What if Khlyen
doesn't run the Rack,

40:16.164 --> 40:18.701
and there’s a whole
other level above him?

40:19.710 --> 40:22.918
Whatever their plan is,
it scares him.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.462
JOHN: What the hells
would scare Khlyen?

40:29.553 --> 40:30.542
D'AVIN: /don't know.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.348
MAN: Long-ass trip.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.271
Better hold him
the whole way.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.734
Take him to the lady.

40:50.782 --> 40:51.988
(GROANS)

41:01.209 --> 41:03.370
D'AVIN: What ifyou’ve been
wrong this whole time, Dutch?

41:05.380 --> 41:07.336
What if Khlyen
isn’t your real enemy,

41:07.424 --> 41:09.710
but he’s protecting you
from who really is?

41:12.429 --> 41:14.385
I'm not ready
to believe that.

41:14.473 --> 41:16.839
Whatever the Rack
are doing on Arkyn,

41:17.142 --> 41:19.975
whatever their plan
is for Level Six,

41:20.062 --> 41:21.518
Khlyen is still
a part of it.

41:22.481 --> 41:23.470
So are you.

41:27.569 --> 41:29.981
You've never been on Arkyn
before today, right?

41:30.072 --> 41:31.983
Of course not,
none of us have.

41:32.074 --> 41:33.063
VVhy?

41:35.243 --> 41:36.619
I saw something else.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.994
In that memory...

41:41.458 --> 41:42.664
It doesn't make any sense.

41:42.751 --> 41:44.036
D'avin, what did you see?

41:47.756 --> 41:49.337
(GRUNTING)

41:55.097 --> 41:56.712
(PANTING)

42:03.146 --> 42:04.602
I saw you.

42:09.778 --> 42:11.268
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

42:13.240 --> 42:15.231
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)
