-Nice talk... Work, what?
-[CREW LAUGHING]

21:27.633 --> 21:29.100
-Nice working with you?
-CREW: Yeah.

21:29.233 --> 21:30.233
Okay.

21:30.367 --> 21:32.934
-CREW: Hi it.
-I-I...

21:33.133 --> 21:34.500
CREW: Run back!

21:34.567 --> 21:36.200
-CREW: Ready.
-I-I...

21:36.266 --> 21:37.400
KATE: Um.

21:38.233 --> 21:39.834
CREW: Whoa! No!

21:40.700 --> 21:41.700
Cut!

21:43.166 --> 21:46.734
Easy for him to say,
he doesn't have to
cook with Kate-zilla.

21:48.467 --> 21:49.800
Yeah, right.

21:50.133 --> 21:52.500
Just wait 'til tomorrow,
when we actually have
to cook something...

21:53.567 --> 21:54.800
Oh, my God.

21:55.066 --> 21:57.667
Just wait 'til tomorrow,
when we actually have
to cook something...

21:58.700 --> 22:00.133
-CREW: Man!
-Go, Hilary!

22:00.200 --> 22:01.533
-Go me!
-CREW: End.
