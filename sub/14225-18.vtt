WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:08.156
(GRUNTING)

00:08.191 --> 00:10.884
OMG! This is really stuck.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.595
What kind of person puts a
bucket on their head on purpose?

00:13.630 --> 00:16.623
I have to wash my hair!

00:16.658 --> 00:18.058
Can you not just use the shower?

00:18.094 --> 00:19.551
Ew! No way.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.044
I pee in there!

00:21.079 --> 00:22.159
(GAGS)

00:24.616 --> 00:25.656
(GRUNTS)

00:26.535 --> 00:28.986
(CHUCKLES)

00:28.988 --> 00:31.271
Whoa, you want to ride
on my handle bars, just ask.

00:31.306 --> 00:32.822
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:32.857 --> 00:35.275
I am so sorry, Sasha.

00:35.310 --> 00:37.260
Jorge got his head stuck
in a bucket again,

00:37.295 --> 00:39.437
and I lost my balance...
And my will to live.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.447
(LAUGHS)

00:41.483 --> 00:42.963
(GROANS) You are funny.

00:43.627 --> 00:44.707
Uh, hey...

00:46.755 --> 00:48.563
Do you want to join me
on my bike ride?

00:48.599 --> 00:52.200
Before I commit, may I ask why there
is a steak tied to your bike?

00:52.235 --> 00:55.787
How else are you going to get the
mountain lions to chase you?

00:55.823 --> 00:58.073
Well, as tempting
as that sounds, (CHUCKLES)

00:58.108 --> 01:02.561
my hammies are quite tender
from today's chair aerobics.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.836
Maybe next time.
Catch you later!

01:07.175 --> 01:09.835
OMG,

01:09.870 --> 01:11.811
Sasha was totally
flirting with you!

01:11.847 --> 01:14.840
Wha... Oh, that is not possible.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.224
Sasha is the coolest
girl in camp.

01:16.260 --> 01:19.419
And I am not even the
coolest guy in Botany Club.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.779
That is Derek, obvi.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.617
Emma's right, she's into you.

01:25.653 --> 01:29.996
Of course, she also teases mountain lions,
so clearly her judgment is impaired.

01:32.693 --> 01:33.984
Well, even
if you guys are right,

01:34.019 --> 01:35.844
I have no idea
how to woo a maiden.

01:35.879 --> 01:39.189
Well, to start off, never
say "woo" or "maiden."

01:39.224 --> 01:42.316
Don't worry, I'll coach you through it.
I'll help too.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.843
Why would he ask you for help?

01:43.878 --> 01:45.604
You just got your head
stuck in a bucket.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.806
Yeah, but I looked
smokin' hot doing it.

01:50.953 --> 01:52.952
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

01:52.988 --> 01:56.048
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

01:56.083 --> 01:57.641
<i>¶ Let's gather by
the campfire light</i>

01:57.676 --> 01:59.501
<i>¶ And sing this song</i>

01:59.536 --> 02:00.902
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:05.115
<i>¶ Hanging out with someone new</i>

02:05.150 --> 02:07.967
<i>¶ Then falling out
of a camp canoe</i>

02:08.003 --> 02:09.845
<i>¶ What's that smell?
It's on your shoe</i>

02:09.880 --> 02:11.121
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:12.800 --> 02:15.224
<i>¶ Got a s'more in my hair</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:17.961
<i>¶ Mosquitos in our underwear</i>

02:17.996 --> 02:19.396
<i>¶ Shower's broke
but we don't care</i>

02:19.431 --> 02:21.340
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:21.375 --> 02:26.303
<i>¶ This is our home away from home
away from home away from home</i>

02:26.338 --> 02:30.690
<i>¶ But watch your back
A bear just ate my phone</i>

02:30.725 --> 02:33.193
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

02:33.228 --> 02:35.562
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

02:35.598 --> 02:37.022
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka ¶</i>

02:47.918 --> 02:51.603
Woodchucks, I am so glad I get to share
the gift of bird-watching with you!

02:51.638 --> 02:54.706
Next time you want to share
a gift with me, I like cash.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.417
Oh, my lucky stars,
a Tufted Titmouse!

03:00.271 --> 03:02.664
Ooh, a Purple Fairy Martin!

03:02.699 --> 03:03.739
And a Tinsel Flea Turnip!

03:06.270 --> 03:09.488
What? I thought we were
just saying weird words.

03:09.523 --> 03:13.475
The Purple Fairy Martin and Tufted
Titmouse are species of birds.

03:13.510 --> 03:17.954
In fact, there are over 400
diverse avian species in Maine.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.731
Eh, they all look
like pigeons to me.

03:21.585 --> 03:25.037
Let's get a closer look at
these magnificent creatures.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.112
If you look up,
don't open your mouth.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.851
TIFFANY: Hey, Zuri, look!

03:31.887 --> 03:34.187
A Tawny Eagle egg.

03:34.222 --> 03:37.181
It must've fallen
from its nest way up there.

03:37.217 --> 03:41.044
Aw, we have to save
this baby birdy.

03:41.079 --> 03:42.545
(GASPS) Let's take it
back to the cabin.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.622
Sweet! I've always wanted
a guard eagle.

03:44.657 --> 03:45.682
Really?

03:45.717 --> 03:48.927
Yes, it's the first step
in becoming a supervillain.

03:51.048 --> 03:52.514
It's good to have goals.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.968
But we can't tell
Lou about this.

03:57.003 --> 04:01.473
Remember when she made us get rid
of that adorable stray puppy?

04:01.508 --> 04:03.475
To be fair, it was a wolf.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.860
Yeah...

04:04.895 --> 04:06.236
I miss Bitey.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.893
Oh, okay, the target

04:13.929 --> 04:15.561
has been spotted.

04:15.597 --> 04:17.138
Don't say target.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.094
You want to take her out,
not "take her out!"

04:21.178 --> 04:22.619
Okay, what do I do?

04:22.654 --> 04:23.803
Walk up to her?

04:23.839 --> 04:25.055
Oh, got it.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.983
But do it in a cool way,
like you're in a Western.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.218
Girls love cowboys.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.526
Howdy, ma'am.

04:37.561 --> 04:39.785
You must be
the new school marm in town.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.061
(WHISPERING) What am I saying?

04:42.974 --> 04:46.609
I have no idea, but did you
just call me a "marm"?

04:48.897 --> 04:51.180
Abort! Punch her and run away.

04:51.215 --> 04:52.375
That's what girls do to me.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.428
Don't listen to bucket head.
Ask her about her day.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.898
And whatever she says,
act fascinated.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.059
Ah! How is your
day going, Sasha?

05:03.095 --> 05:04.769
Well, so far,
I've just had breakfast.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.546
Really? That is fascinating!

05:08.775 --> 05:11.092
Ah, not really,
it was just a donut.

05:11.127 --> 05:14.512
I can't believe
she took the last donut!

05:14.547 --> 05:17.782
I can't believe
you took the last donut!

05:17.817 --> 05:21.152
Well, if it makes you feel any
better, it was stale. (BOTH CHUCKLE)

05:21.188 --> 05:22.388
It doesn't.

05:26.084 --> 05:27.042
Don't let her go!

05:27.077 --> 05:28.409
Oh, wait!

05:28.445 --> 05:30.028
(EXCLAIMING)

05:36.686 --> 05:39.245
Whoa!

05:39.281 --> 05:41.322
That was some hardcore parkour!

05:41.357 --> 05:43.624
Great! He's in!

05:43.660 --> 05:45.484
I like to live life on the edge.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.064
In fact, I may just leave some
of these splinters in my tushy.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.398
(CHUCKLES)

05:50.433 --> 05:53.185
And he's out again.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.930
Uh, Sasha, would you
want to go on a date with me?

05:56.965 --> 05:59.916
Sure! Well, you cannot
blame a guy for trying...

05:59.951 --> 06:01.071
Wait, did you just say yes?

06:02.295 --> 06:03.328
(CHUCKLING) Yes.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.363
BOTH: Yes!

06:05.165 --> 06:06.839
They have sporks.

06:06.874 --> 06:09.067
And Ravi finally got a date!

06:15.308 --> 06:17.116
Who's a cute little eggy?

06:17.152 --> 06:19.160
You are. Yes, you are!

06:21.339 --> 06:23.073
Hey, Zuri.

06:23.108 --> 06:24.449
(DOOR CLOSES) I found this book

06:24.484 --> 06:25.764
about baby birds in the library.

06:25.794 --> 06:29.229
It's called <i>"What to Expect</i>
<i>When You're Eggs-pecting."</i>

06:29.264 --> 06:31.281
(CHUCKLES)

06:31.316 --> 06:33.796
We don't need a book,
we can just "wing" it.

06:35.938 --> 06:39.555
Oh, but "Eggs-pecting"
is so clever.

06:39.591 --> 06:43.826
Anyway, the book says that the baby bird
will need food as soon as it's hatched.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.871
So, we should stock up
on worms now.

06:45.906 --> 06:49.566
Right. I say we flip a coin to see who
does the chewing and regurgitating.

06:51.728 --> 06:54.287
Or we can use a blender.

06:54.322 --> 06:57.349
Sure. If you want
to be a lazy parent.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.834
Next you'll be leaving her
with a birdysitter,

06:58.869 --> 07:03.012
who will just stick her
in front of the TV all day.

07:03.048 --> 07:03.997
Little Shelly deserves better.

07:04.032 --> 07:07.942
Shelly? I thought we were
going to name her Egg-atha.

07:07.977 --> 07:09.811
Fine, if you want her
to be teased,

07:09.846 --> 07:13.423
spend all her birthdays alone,
and never get asked to prom.

07:15.744 --> 07:18.035
Then, she'll wind up
an old maid,

07:18.071 --> 07:21.431
with a bunch of cats, who will
eat her, because she's a bird!

07:23.109 --> 07:26.352
Or none of those things will
happen, because she is a bird.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.527
Hey, my little Chuck-lets.

07:33.562 --> 07:34.694
What's going on?

07:34.729 --> 07:35.729
BOTH: Nothing!

07:36.815 --> 07:39.315
Okay.

07:39.351 --> 07:40.767
So, Zuri, how do you like
the bird-watching?

07:40.802 --> 07:42.394
What was your favorite part?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.669
(GRUNTS) Spending time with you.
Now get lost!

07:45.382 --> 07:47.574
Bye. Visit anytime.

07:47.609 --> 07:49.725
I will, because
this is my cabin.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.486
And has been for eight years.

07:51.521 --> 07:53.454
Then it's time for a change.

07:53.490 --> 07:55.606
Yeah. Why don't you
check out Bunny cabin?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.762
They have a really great view
of the cesspool.

07:59.037 --> 08:01.253
Okay, something's going on here.

08:01.289 --> 08:03.214
You two are sweating
like hogs in a hot tub.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.930
We like to give them a spa
day before we... You know.

08:10.248 --> 08:12.290
Ooh, is that a
Red breasted Nuthatch?

08:12.326 --> 08:14.206
Ooh, that's my favorite
of all the nuthatches.

08:16.220 --> 08:17.854
Phew!

08:17.889 --> 08:20.023
That was close.

08:20.058 --> 08:21.341
(GASPS) Zuri! The egg!

08:21.376 --> 08:23.217
(CLATTERS)

08:23.253 --> 08:25.353
Thank goodness.
You almost broke it.

08:25.389 --> 08:26.454
I broke something.

08:31.936 --> 08:35.180
Hey, there's my lady killer!

08:35.215 --> 08:37.774
How did your whitewater
rafting date go?

08:37.809 --> 08:39.784
It was humiliating.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.929
When we went over the rapids, I
screamed like a toddler on Santa's lap.

08:42.964 --> 08:46.590
Maybe she thought they were
screams of excitement?

08:46.626 --> 08:49.261
Yes. And maybe she also
thought the wetness

08:49.296 --> 08:51.096
in my pants was from the river.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.283
Don't worry, champ.

08:55.318 --> 08:57.918
Pick yourself up,
change your underwear,

08:57.954 --> 09:00.413
and focus on the second date.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.135
Did you not hear the
wee-wee-in-the pants story?

09:04.269 --> 09:05.869
Hey, Ravi, do you have a second?

09:05.904 --> 09:08.146
Here it comes.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.823
I know, I have
a great personality,

09:09.858 --> 09:10.916
but you just want to be friends.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.026
(CHUCKLES) No.

09:13.061 --> 09:14.861
Wait, you do not
want to be friends?

09:15.805 --> 09:17.522
Of course.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.677
I came over to see if you
want to go on a second date?

09:19.927 --> 09:21.350
Second date?

09:21.386 --> 09:22.677
Second date!

09:25.557 --> 09:29.291
Well, yes, I cannot wait
to go out with you again!

09:29.327 --> 09:30.359
Oh, I am so happy.

09:30.395 --> 09:31.494
Nay, elated!

09:31.529 --> 09:33.254
I have...

09:33.289 --> 09:35.373
(CLEARS THROAT) I mean,
cool, whatevs.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.666
(CHUCKLES)

09:36.701 --> 09:41.863
Sweet! And whatever we do, it
has to be totally extreme!

09:41.898 --> 09:43.114
(BOTH LAUGHING)

09:43.149 --> 09:45.224
Come on, X me!

09:45.259 --> 09:46.659
Okay, extreme
starts with an "E,"

09:46.694 --> 09:49.520
but I suppose I will throw caution
and spelling to the wind!

09:49.556 --> 09:50.596
(EXCLAIMS)

09:57.673 --> 09:59.563
Hey, Sasha.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.116
Wow, Ravi!
You're not limping anymore.

10:02.151 --> 10:03.976
You are an extreme healer!
(GROANS)

10:04.012 --> 10:06.237
I love that!

10:06.273 --> 10:09.198
Oh, yes, I am a speedy clotter.
(CHUCKLES)

10:09.234 --> 10:11.443
So, what shall we do
for our hangout?

10:11.445 --> 10:12.861
Dude, when you're with me,
you don't "hang out."

10:12.896 --> 10:16.981
Hang, chill, relax, are
not words in my vocabulary!

10:17.016 --> 10:19.792
Then I think our next date
should be at an SAT prep course.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.119
(CHUCKLES)

10:21.154 --> 10:23.763
I'd rather do an obstacle course.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

10:23.798 --> 10:27.291
But right now,
we're going to joust.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.652
Super romantic, right?

10:29.687 --> 10:30.687
Is it?

10:32.682 --> 10:36.509
Aw, look at Ravi with Sasha.

10:36.544 --> 10:38.669
JORGE: Our little boy
is all grown up.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.985
And there's finally a girl talking to him
who's not a family member or a teacher.

10:43.284 --> 10:46.928
Isn't this so much fun? (GROANS)

10:46.963 --> 10:51.341
(CHUCKLES) If I say yes,
will you stop pummeling me?

10:51.376 --> 10:53.801
Come on, bro,
don't go easy on me!

10:53.836 --> 10:55.320
Hit me as hard as you can!

10:55.355 --> 10:58.898
Ha! Very well. Get ready
for me to bring the pain!

10:58.934 --> 11:00.574
(LAUGHING) (GRUNTING)

11:01.286 --> 11:02.286
Stop! That tickles.

11:05.172 --> 11:07.773
Aw, young love is adorable.

11:19.921 --> 11:21.680
<i>¶ When the wind blows... ¶</i>

11:21.715 --> 11:24.640
Hello, the wind probably
blew her out of the nest.

11:24.675 --> 11:27.034
Way to traumatize her.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.953
I'm sorry, Shelly.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.030
I'll just tell you a story.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.506
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall...

11:32.541 --> 11:33.641
Nope!

11:35.437 --> 11:40.272
And lived happily ever after,
without a great fall.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.241
It's Lou! Quick, hide Egg-atha!

11:42.276 --> 11:43.796
Shelly! Whatever!

11:45.989 --> 11:48.498
(SIGHS) I have been looking for
that Red breasted Nuthatch forever!

11:48.533 --> 11:50.933
(DOOR CLOSES) Are you
sure that's what you saw?

11:51.419 --> 11:52.977
Absolutely.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.846
I mean, two wings, a beak...

11:55.882 --> 11:57.082
What else could it have been?

11:58.709 --> 12:00.042
Every bird in existence.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.204
LOU: Uh, Zuri...

12:03.239 --> 12:04.239
What's going on

12:05.074 --> 12:06.090
there?

12:06.993 --> 12:08.534
Uh...

12:08.569 --> 12:11.062
I just went through puberty.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.680
On one side.

12:15.177 --> 12:16.857
Don't you hate
when that happens?

12:18.563 --> 12:20.296
Okay, fess up.
What are you guys hiding?

12:20.331 --> 12:23.357
(SIGHS) Okay, Lou,
this is Shelly.

12:24.269 --> 12:26.402
Shelly, say hi.

12:26.437 --> 12:27.445
Oh, she's shy.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.706
This is a Tawny Eagle egg.

12:30.742 --> 12:33.292
Did you learn nothing from
when I had to take Bitey away?

12:33.328 --> 12:36.788
Only that there's a lump of ice
where your heart should be!

12:36.823 --> 12:40.183
Hey, that wolf tried to take a
chunk out of my prized hams.

12:40.710 --> 12:43.202
Now get to explaining.

12:43.238 --> 12:45.371
We found the egg
when we were bird watching.

12:45.407 --> 12:47.873
So we're taking care of it
till it hatches.

12:47.909 --> 12:50.050
Girls, taking this egg
was a huge mistake.

12:50.086 --> 12:51.702
Eagles are a protected species.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.821
What were we supposed to do?

12:53.857 --> 12:56.297
Leave it in the forest,
like Gladys left Timmy?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.811
No, we need to turn it
over to a wildlife officer.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.021
Eagle eggs are high-maintenance,

13:02.057 --> 13:03.747
and require a lot of attention.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.233
So does Emma, but we keep her!

13:07.462 --> 13:08.542
I'm sorry, girls.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.626
We can't let Shelly be raised

13:14.661 --> 13:16.869
by a bunch of strangers.
(DOOR CLOSES)

13:16.904 --> 13:18.971
No one's gonna love her
as much as we do.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.756
Except...

13:20.791 --> 13:21.833
Possibly her bird mom?

13:24.362 --> 13:26.170
Maybe we should take
Shelly back to her nest.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.547
But she'd love New York.

13:28.582 --> 13:30.622
There's eight million people
to poop on.

13:32.537 --> 13:34.897
(SIGHS) Fine, I'll start
getting her ready.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.168
Uh... Why are you
putting her hat on her butt?

13:41.204 --> 13:43.546
This is her butt?

13:43.581 --> 13:45.621
Oh, man, I've been
kissing the wrong cheeks.

13:49.712 --> 13:52.847
Ow! Ow!

13:52.882 --> 13:55.107
I cannot believe
you did extreme fire jousting.

13:55.142 --> 13:57.202
Why not?

13:57.237 --> 13:59.720
It is so much more fun when there
is more at stake. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

13:59.756 --> 14:02.056
Yeah, like your fingerprints!

14:02.091 --> 14:05.718
On the bright side, I can now commit
a crime without being traced.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.437
Good, because there's
a couple kids in Bunny cabin

14:08.473 --> 14:09.964
I'd like to see "take a hike."

14:13.269 --> 14:15.086
Ravi, I'm happy
you're dating Sasha,

14:15.121 --> 14:18.931
but can't you at least ask her if she
wants to do something more chill?

14:18.966 --> 14:21.492
The only "chill" thing
Sasha has ever done

14:21.528 --> 14:23.448
is get frostbite while
dog sledding in Alaska.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.156
Don't listen to her, bro.

14:27.192 --> 14:29.284
Love hurts.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.366
Yeah, but it shouldn't
give you third degree burns.

14:31.838 --> 14:32.838
Chicks dig scars.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.183
My uncle told me that.

14:37.218 --> 14:39.258
He's a really
bad plastic surgeon.

14:43.674 --> 14:49.011
(PANTING) Wow, it feels like
we've been climbing forever,

14:49.046 --> 14:51.280
but at least the view is great.

14:51.315 --> 14:52.515
Not from where I'm standing.

14:58.348 --> 15:00.239
We made it!

15:00.275 --> 15:03.543
Oh, look, what a lovely nest.

15:03.578 --> 15:06.571
Yeah, but I'm not sure
about the neighborhood.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.432
I saw some sketchy squirrels
on the way up here.

15:09.467 --> 15:11.934
Zuri, Shelly will be fine.

15:11.969 --> 15:13.129

Did this tree grow
since we've been up here?

15:24.899 --> 15:26.465
I'm afraid to climb down!

15:26.500 --> 15:28.860
(CHOKING) Be careful!

15:28.895 --> 15:30.486
You're going to knock
Shelly out of her nest!

15:30.521 --> 15:33.464
At least she has a protective
shell to break her fall!

15:33.499 --> 15:36.625
I only have you!

15:36.661 --> 15:39.612
Look, I'm sure eventually
someone at camp

15:39.648 --> 15:41.247
will notice we're missing
and come rescue us.

15:41.282 --> 15:44.362
Or they'll just think, "Oh,
goodie, more pudding for us!"

15:45.712 --> 15:49.463

is going to be fine.

I heard you and Sasha were going
skydiving, but I didn't believe it.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.694
I mean, you won't even
do regular diving.

16:20.729 --> 16:24.557
I know, but with Sasha, I'm a new man.
Jorge, my step stool.

16:28.021 --> 16:32.740
Emma, being in a relationship
is about compromise.

16:32.775 --> 16:35.058
Maybe when it comes
to pizza toppings,

16:35.094 --> 16:37.870
but not when it comes
to living or dying.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.021
(SIGHS) Ravi, you need
to break up with this girl.

16:39.056 --> 16:40.889
No way!

16:40.924 --> 16:42.883
He can't risk losing Sasha.

16:42.918 --> 16:46.728

who wants to go out with him.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.781

16:56.816 --> 16:58.532
Sasha is my
first real girlfriend,

17:00.820 --> 17:01.519
You know how I know
you're wrong?

17:01.554 --> 17:03.971

started with "Jorge is right."

22:08.977 --> 22:10.897
You know, Ravi,
I'm really proud of you.

22:10.922 --> 22:14.657
(SIGHS) Why? Because I became the
world's first human Christmas ornament?

22:14.692 --> 22:17.635
No, because even though you
wanted Sasha as your girlfriend,

22:17.670 --> 22:21.310
you realized it wasn't worth
pretending to be someone you're not.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.231
Thank you, Emma.

22:23.267 --> 22:27.202
I still say, you got to do what
you got to do to get the ladies.

22:27.237 --> 22:30.797
I've pretended to be a spy, an
astronaut, and a proctologist.

22:33.494 --> 22:34.760
And that works?

22:36.730 --> 22:39.423
Nope. Not even once.

22:39.458 --> 22:47.458
By the way,
what's a proctologist?
