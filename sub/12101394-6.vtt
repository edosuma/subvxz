-How come, Mommy?

14:44.884 --> 14:48.221

14:48.305 --> 14:51.766

14:51.850 --> 14:55.478
When she was a baby...

14:55.562 --> 14:59.482
some strangers found her

14:59.566 --> 15:01.276
in a Dumpster.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.199
She had been there
the whole day.

15:08.283 --> 15:11.161
And...

15:11.244 --> 15:13.872
it even made the news.

15:13.955 --> 15:17.125
A little black baby girl

15:17.208 --> 15:19.461
found in the Dumpster
all alone.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.507
And even then,
no one claimed her.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.717
No one wanted her.

15:25.800 --> 15:30.221
They thought she was wrong.

15:30.305 --> 15:35.185
She went from home to home,

15:35.268 --> 15:36.728
family to family.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.317
Always alone.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.028
-What happened when she grew up?

15:46.071 --> 15:47.572
-Well...

15:50.367 --> 15:52.410
She was still alone.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.746

15:54.829 --> 15:56.373
someone to spend time with,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.583
someone to laugh...

15:58.667 --> 15:59.918
But...

16:02.295 --> 16:03.546
No one...

16:05.382 --> 16:07.759
No one really liked her.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.135
-How come, Mommy?

16:11.596 --> 16:15.183
-Um... they didn't think
she was very fun.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.601
Maybe she wasn't.

16:16.685 --> 16:21.064
Maybe during, um, dinner

16:21.147 --> 16:22.774
or a boring movie,

16:22.857 --> 16:25.527
she would drift off
and think of that Dumpster.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.820
And...

16:29.280 --> 16:31.199
You know, it's, uh...

16:31.282 --> 16:34.244
darkness smell...

16:34.327 --> 16:35.745
(liquid pours)

16:37.706 --> 16:40.375
It's meaning...

16:40.458 --> 16:44.671

she belonged in the world.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.761
(wind whistling)

16:56.266 --> 16:57.934
But then, uh...

17:08.987 --> 17:10.071
-But then?

17:13.825 --> 17:14.951
Your story.

17:19.831 --> 17:20.915
-Yeah.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.670
But then...

17:25.754 --> 17:27.297
this woman,

17:27.380 --> 17:29.257
she decided that she was...

17:32.802 --> 17:34.262
In a change of fate,

17:34.345 --> 17:35.638
she was never
gonna be alone again.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.557
She was gonna have a baby.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.727
-And did she?
Did she have the baby, Mommy?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.402
-Yes.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.949
And she had him, but he didn't
come out like she thought.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.038
-He didn't?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.167
What was wrong with him?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.502
(knocking on door)

18:20.058 --> 18:23.019
-Ma'am?
-What do you want?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.395
-OFFICER:
We got a call.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.147
Operator said
she heard you scream.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.357
Is everything okay here?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.535
-Ma'am.
-Yes, everything's fine.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.329
-Then why'd you call?

18:41.412 --> 18:42.997
Are you alone?

18:46.042 --> 18:47.418
-My son's here.

18:47.502 --> 18:50.547
-Did you call about your son?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.298
Why don't I have a word
with him?

18:59.097 --> 19:02.183
-No.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.561
You're not touching him.
He's fine.

19:04.644 --> 19:08.189
-Ma'am?

19:08.273 --> 19:11.192
-There's nothing wrong with him.

19:11.276 --> 19:13.236
We're fine.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.530
-Next time I'm called back here,
I'm gonna have to...

19:15.613 --> 19:17.323
(latch clicks)

19:17.407 --> 19:21.494
-So what was going on
with the kid, Mom?

19:21.578 --> 19:25.415
The... The one from your story?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.713
-Nothing, baby.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.508
He was perfect.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.803
