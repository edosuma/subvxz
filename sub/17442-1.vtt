00:42.876 --> 00:45.246
- Where is my advertisement?
- What advertisement?

00:45.313 --> 00:48.349
The one that should be in the

00:54.722 --> 00:57.024
- Where is the advertisement?
- Took it down.

00:57.091 --> 01:00.128
It didn't seem to interest the
public like some of the others.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.163
'Nobody's paid for the last
couple of weeks.'

01:02.230 --> 01:03.831
That's five bob owing.

How can I conduct my practice
without advertising, tell me.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.869

that's five bob's owing.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.039
There.

01:12.106 --> 01:15.042
- Okay, grandpa, back it goes.
- Thank you.

to go over the spadework

01:52.380 --> 01:54.182
I'm sorry, dear.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.817
I got in to an argument
with that tobacconist fellow

01:58.252 --> 02:00.921
Oh, bother,
I forgot to pay him.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.923
Oh, I took care of it.

- Tomorrow?
- Why not?

All I have to do is to check
the equipment once more.

Oh, no.
A mind confused by alcohol.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.506
It must be alert,
able to respond.

up here, in that room.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.600

- Have him pick something up.
- Yes.

is to stop concentrating

will get less.

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:39.528
[Knocking]

01:16:42.966 --> 01:16:44.467
[Knocking continues]

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:57.847
Mike, let us in.
We wanna talk to you.

01:16:57.914 --> 01:17:00.817
Michael, unlock
the door, please.

01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:07.023
What do you want anyway?

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.492
I thought we weren't
on speaking terms.

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:10.894
To hell with that.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.428
- It's about that girl.
- What girl?

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:14.563
The one you went
out with, the singer.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.365
What the hell
are you talking about.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:19.769
You were the last girl I went
out with, didn't do me good.

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:22.338
- Last night at the club.
- Who sang with the group.

01:17:22.405 --> 01:17:24.373
- Laura.
- That slag?

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.010
(Mike)
'You must me joking.
I wouldn't look at her.'

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:29.412
I'm very busy,
I got a lot to do.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.514
Would you two love
birds leave me alone.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.516
- Michele we must talk to you.
- Why?

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:37.586
Laura was killed last night.
And another girl too.

01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:42.391
He must work somewhere.
Try looking for a letter head

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:44.694
Something that will
give us an idea of where.

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:46.529
But that's not
gonna much use, today.

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:47.764
Everything's closed.

01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:49.365
Well, it's better than nothing.

01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:51.434
We're not gonna get
anywhere if we wait

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.803
Looking for blood stains
or something damn stupid.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:55.338
Well, that's true enough.

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:00.509
[Intense music]

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.287
You don't remember coming to the
club then, where were you?

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:13.322
- I don't know.
- You must have some idea.

01:18:13.389 --> 01:18:15.624
- You shut up here, then?
- Went for a walk

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.260
- Where to?
- To see a friend.

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:18.627
That's my business.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.596
- A girl?
- So what if I did?

01:18:20.663 --> 01:18:24.100
- A girl called Audrey Woods.
- Yeah, we used to out together.

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:27.503
Audrey Woods was
killed last night.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.405
And you killed
her, didn't you, Mike?

01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:31.007
No, I don't remember.

01:18:31.074 --> 01:18:33.142
- You don't remember much.
- Some things, yes.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.844
Like blackouts
when you kill people.

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:38.014
I don't know what you're talking
about. I don't kill anybody.

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:41.250
You were two girls, last
night, one you admit to seeing

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:46.289
Both murdered.
If you didn't do it, who did?

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:48.825
I don't know, I keep telling
you I can't remember.

01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:50.626
Do you remember
going swimming with me

01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:52.461
- Yes.
- Or being on a motor bike?

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.297
- Or fight me in the garage?
- Yes.

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:56.766
- Or killing two girls?
- No.

01:18:58.835 --> 01:19:00.503
Now, get out.
Leave me alone.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:03.472
- Come on, Mike, tell the truth.
- Get out of here!

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:05.508
Leave me alone, go get out!

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.110
They suspect, or they know.

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:10.546
Kill.

01:19:11.848 --> 01:19:14.383
Michael, what's the matter?

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:19.122
- Kill.
- No.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.990
[Gasps]

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:24.227
Put it down, Mike.
Nichole get help, quick.

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:34.103
Ah.

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:39.742
[Groaning]

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:58.227
[Siren blaring]

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:19.482

01:20:52.882 --> 01:20:54.550
You alright, son?

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:55.784
I'm fine.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:57.053
You're not hurt?

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.288
No, no.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.391
[Tires screeching]

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:29.152
Marcus, what are you doing?

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:38.327
[Siren blaring]

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:47.103

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:13.589
[Intense music]

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:15.791
Stop, Marcus, stop.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.432
Stop.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.769
[Tires screeching]

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.713
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

01:23:39.115 --> 01:23:41.350
I had to do it, Estelle.

01:23:43.186 --> 01:23:45.154
[Screaming]

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.662

[Nicole crying]

01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:42.245

- Yes, sir.
