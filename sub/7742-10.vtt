00:01.710 --> 00:03.336
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:03.420 --> 00:06.798
Please step away from the gurney transfers
and the heavy lifting.

00:06.882 --> 00:09.300
And for the love of all that's good and holy,
get an MRI.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.302
I almost don't want to see the damage.

00:11.387 --> 00:14.263
We want to launch a citywide campaign

00:14.348 --> 00:17.350
featuring you as the face of All Saints.

00:17.434 --> 00:21.479
Dr. Cooper, pay attention!
You need to pay attention!

00:22.398 --> 00:24.065
Dude, dude! What the hell?

00:26.402 --> 00:29.904
You know I'm fine.
You don't need to stay here.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.412
This machine is a piece of shit!

00:38.706 --> 00:40.456
I'm gonna begin interviewing
for a pharmacist.

00:40.541 --> 00:44.043
-I've already put in a call to Eddie Walzer.
-Awesome!

00:44.128 --> 00:46.587
Eddie kind of lost it
when the Pill-O-Matix came.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.716
-It's not that he wasn't good at his job...
-All right, I hear you.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.634
Grace, open the door!

00:52.344 --> 00:53.511
Honey.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.513
Oh, my God.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.164
Hi. Is Dr. O'Hara in yet?

02:03.832 --> 02:05.750
Great, can you get her for me?
Oh, wait. I got it.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.502
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.378
Here you go, sweetie.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.882
Good morning. How are you?

02:13.842 --> 02:16.511
Listen, can I steal you for a minute
when I get in?

02:16.595 --> 02:18.387
Okay. Great, thanks.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.785
-Who's seen this?
-Half of ortho.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.829
The main spine guy is in Barbados.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.539
Meanwhile, my follow-ups
keep getting pushed.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.791
Yeah, well, fuck that.
You need to see a specialist.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.462
I am the least of my problems.
Grace is pulling her hair out.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.218
Oh, God. I'm really sorry, Jackie.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.349
Eddie used to give me some oxy.

03:04.768 --> 03:08.229
Between cortisone shots,
when it would get really bad.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.404
I could do that, if you like.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.489
Give you a couple of oxy.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.827
Yeah. You know, I guess that would...

03:22.911 --> 03:24.954
Short of banging you over the head
to put you out of your misery,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.498
I don't see what else I can do.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.961
All right. Great. Just let me know.
I'll stop by and get a prescription.

03:35.465 --> 03:39.010
No, because what happens is it flares up
and I haven't, you know... Never mind.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.803
It's beating a dead horse.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.264
Who came up with that anyway?

03:43.348 --> 03:46.684
The same awful people that like to kill
two birds with one stone, I imagine.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.272
You know who I like?
People who let sleeping dogs lie.

03:57.613 --> 04:02.199
What qualifies you for the position
of emergency department pharmacist?

04:02.284 --> 04:04.619
What qualifies me? Seriously?

04:06.288 --> 04:08.331
I did this job for 10 years.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.708
You also came in here drunk,

04:10.792 --> 04:13.210
not to mention you had
to have your stomach pumped.

04:13.295 --> 04:17.173
One might think these incidents
would disqualify you to run a pharmacy.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.301
Oh, man.
Either you want me back or you don't.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.305
Cook me or sew me back up.
This in-between shit...

04:26.350 --> 04:28.392
I need some assurance that you're stable.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.314
Both things happened after I left.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.983
My work was impeccable for 10 years.

04:36.526 --> 04:40.821
Plus, I still have a lab coat,
so you save the... Right.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.074
Now you're going to tell me
you'll get back to me

04:43.158 --> 04:45.201
and I'll be checking my messages.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.246
Or I might just say,
"Welcome back to All Saints."

04:50.999 --> 04:53.125
Yeah? Really?

04:57.506 --> 04:59.799
-I'm gonna rock this shit.
-I wish you wouldn't.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.426
-No, it's just an expression.
-Still.

05:07.683 --> 05:08.891
Eddie!

05:08.976 --> 05:11.394
It's gonna be like old times, bro!
I'm telling you.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.437
Hey. Hey. This is the man!

05:13.522 --> 05:14.939
-No. Listen, Coop...
-This is the man right here!

05:15.023 --> 05:17.400
Coop, listen, listen. I gotta bounce.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.403
Yeah, yeah, yeah, later. Bounce. Bounce.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.198
Hey. Got a minute?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.283
Actually, I don't.

05:26.368 --> 05:30.204
Yeah, well, we got a whack job
coming in five, so I'll keep it brief.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.707
Emotionally disturbed person, Dr. Cooper.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.333
Here's what it is.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.461
I think I was part of
a very successful campaign.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.629
You were.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.423
So how come
they're taking the posters down?

05:40.507 --> 05:41.882
Stop that!

05:42.467 --> 05:46.303
I mean, why not keep a good thing going?
Right? Seems to me...

05:46.388 --> 05:48.472
All Saints rented the ad space for six weeks.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.142
Those six weeks are up, Dr. Cooper.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.602
-I...
-Please answer your pager.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.313
You heard that? It's on vibrate.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.274
Someone may be dying.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.985
The nurses will keep them alive
until I get there. It's their job.

06:01.069 --> 06:05.322
So, what needs to happen
in order to keep the campaign going?

06:05.407 --> 06:07.241
I mean, I'm... Sorry.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.745
I'm totally willing to
keep the campaign going.

06:10.829 --> 06:14.957
I'll, I don't know, pay out of pocket.
I could pay for the ad space

06:15.042 --> 06:18.085
-if it helps...
-That's a very generous offer, Dr. Cooper.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.796
I'm a very generous guy.

06:21.757 --> 06:25.551
So, seems like a win-win, right?
What do you think?

06:27.345 --> 06:30.598
-I can hear your pager vibrating, Dr. Cooper.
-I know. I know. Whatever.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.975
Just... Can you think about it?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.352
Gloria?

06:38.774 --> 06:42.026
Thirty-ish male, altered mental status.
Found disoriented and naked.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.196
-Whack job. Got it.
-EBP. Psych Eval.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.615
Dude started peeling his clothes off
at the grocery store.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.034
They had to call the police.
The police called us.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.745
No, stay here. Give me the keys. Thank you.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.497
Get his arms.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.126
Someone tell the cops to stop
dumping their disorderlies at All Saints.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.462
On my count. One, two, three.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.053
You're all right. You're okay.
We're right here.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.222
Let's keep him sedated.
Give him five and two.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.682
He's not agitated and he's not resisting.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.352
-BP's 110 over 70.
-I want to stay on top of it.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.605
Start the line. Hey, buddy. Buddy?

07:20.315 --> 07:22.566
-You know where you are?
-No.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.777
-No.
-You're at All Saints.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.320
Can you tell me your name?

07:27.322 --> 07:28.823
No? I'm Jackie.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.242
Don't worry, we're gonna take
very good care of you, okay?

07:31.326 --> 07:33.494
He smells like fresh laundry.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.916
Hey, Marco?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.961
-Can you tell me how you got here today?
-No.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.713
Do you know what year it is?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.007
-No, ma'am.
-It's 2010.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.135
Thank you.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.180
Can you ask around
and see if you can find some family?

07:53.265 --> 07:56.600
I thought I recognized you.
Marco Prince, linebacker!

07:56.685 --> 07:59.019
Right? Wow. This guy's famous.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.354
It's an honor to meet you.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.691
Brotherhood of the broken nose, right?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.401
Hey, kill the H and A. He's cool.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.238
Marco, we're gonna take good care of you.
You having a rough day?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.115
Yeah. Dude got picked in the first round.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.284
Linebackers never get picked
in the first round.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.578
Florida Gators, I know.
I'm gay, I'm not a girl.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.621
Sam's calling around.
Also, there's a lady in three.

08:17.706 --> 08:21.417
She's 49. She's having pain in her
swimsuit area. I'm thinking it's an appy.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.377
-Can I take it?
-It's all yours.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.172
Let's get this guy an MRI,
full blood and spinal tap,

08:26.256 --> 08:30.593
rule out infection, brain tumor, bleed...
Treat him like a king.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.761
As opposed to a whack job?

08:33.555 --> 08:36.724
Marco Prince, fantastic.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.521
Lower

08:42.606 --> 08:45.566
abdominal

08:46.234 --> 08:47.776
pain.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.070
-We've been through this already.
-Just being thorough.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.072
Are you sexually active?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.617
No. Pretty much just lie there.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.163
No, I meant...

09:02.542 --> 09:04.001
A joke. Got it.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.003
Hello, hello.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.131
Lower quadrant.
CBC came back, white count's high.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.800
We're in line for a beta
and waiting on a CAT scan.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.221
I'm telling you right now,
my appendix is dead and rotting,

09:15.305 --> 09:17.514
so how about a Valium drip
and a nice Merlot?

09:17.599 --> 09:19.099
Not saying no.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.436
I do think your appendix has ruptured.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.857
All right. Rule out pregnancy,
get her into CT and call the OR.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.944
Oh, my God! The two of you. Seriously?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.780
I'm forty-fucking-nine years old, okay?

09:39.621 --> 09:42.748
-May I help you?
-I'm looking for Marco Prince.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.458
Hi. Are you his wife?

09:44.668 --> 09:46.252
There's my guy.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.878
Hey, baby.

09:50.882 --> 09:51.966
I'm sorry.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.550
What are you sorry for?

09:53.635 --> 09:56.887
Would you like to eat something?
We have some meal trays right over here.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.973
-That would be nice.
-Okay.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.142
You know what happened?

10:02.227 --> 10:04.270
Someone called the police.
That's all I know.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.273
Janelle came looking for you,
but you were already gone.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.526
Where did I go?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.528
SuperValu.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.154
What did I do?

10:14.698 --> 10:15.990
Took off your clothes.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.535
-God...
-Baby, no. It's not a big deal.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.204
Good-looking guy like you,
you made their day.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.373
Look, you had to leave work again.

10:25.041 --> 10:29.461
You know what I say to that? Lucky me.
That's what I say.

10:29.838 --> 10:33.299
If either of you need anything,
please don't hesitate.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.344
Do you mind me asking

10:38.221 --> 10:41.432
if you're the same Marco Prince
who played ball?

10:41.516 --> 10:42.850
Yes, ma'am.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.769
Yes, you mind, or yes, you are?

10:45.854 --> 10:47.104
Yes, I am.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.065
You have officially made my day,
Mr. Prince.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.527
Blindside sack
on the Tennessee quarterback.

10:54.863 --> 10:55.988
You're my hero.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.124
You are so brave.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.209
I could never move to a foreign country.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.503
You underestimate yourself.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.840
No. I would miss American candy.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.760
What you'd miss are your people.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.553
I don't have people.

11:19.637 --> 11:23.182
Excuse me. I beg your pardon,
you have me, you have Jackie,

11:23.266 --> 11:24.808
you have Lenny.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.687
Having Lenny scares me.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.483
Not having Lenny scares me.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.361
Wow! Okay.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.824
So, who do you miss
from your foreign land?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.660
-The Queen.
-Together?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.996
-Yes.
-No.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.082
Yes.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.543
What if I can never pay you back?

11:59.761 --> 12:01.387
She's my friend.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.854
So, we ordered an MRI and a spinal tap.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.689
They are doing his blood work as we speak.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.525
Can we cancel it, please?

12:14.984 --> 12:18.153
-Sorry?
-You need to cancel the MRI.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.949
Our insurance is going to kick it back.
We can't afford it.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.785
It's not like anyone can fix it.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.121
He's not sick-sick.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.124
He's got early onset dementia.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.667
He was a linebacker.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.377
Yes, I heard. First round.

12:33.461 --> 12:37.047
And he's not 6'5" and he's not 300 lbs,
so he's fast

12:37.424 --> 12:39.299
and tough as shit.

12:40.677 --> 12:44.847
I could wallpaper my bathroom with MRIs.
We don't need another one.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.099
I know what his brain looks like.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.768
-All right?
-Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

12:56.651 --> 12:57.985
What are you doing for lunch?

12:58.069 --> 13:00.195
Want to get a little Quiznos,
hang out in the pharmacy,

13:00.280 --> 13:01.572
kick it old-school?

13:01.656 --> 13:03.907
Can't turn back the hands of time, Coop.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.244
So, let's do something different. Sushi.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.329
I made plans, bro. Sorry.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.833
Water off a duck's back.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.881
Hey, Zoey, you want to get a little lunch?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.508
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.678
I'm having lunch with Jackie.
Help a sister out.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.015
-Sorry, Lenny. Ladies only.
-That's cool.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.477
What about you?
You want to get a grinder?

13:32.187 --> 13:37.357
As wildly tempting as a grinder sounds,
I have far too much respect for Zoey

13:37.442 --> 13:39.526
to horn in on her territory.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.111
Loud and clear.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.490
I'll go to lunch with you.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.033
No, thanks.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.078
What about you, Thor? Grab a bite?

13:50.163 --> 13:53.040
No lunch for Thor today.
He needs to drop some of that weight.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.208
I can totally hear you.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.294
Still need to drop some of that weight.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.007
You need anything?

14:02.091 --> 14:04.801
No. Just... Thank you.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.806
It's embarrassing.
You break your arm, you're still you.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.893
You break your brain, you're not you
anymore, and it freaks me out.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.521
We used to have it nailed down.

14:15.605 --> 14:19.233
We had a guy who lived with us.
He took care of me,

14:20.193 --> 14:23.320
but we pretty much burned
through everything we had, so...

14:23.404 --> 14:24.738
Our neighbor looks in on him.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.407
I don't know where I go, man.

14:28.201 --> 14:32.329
'Cause I don't want to leave.
But I do and I don't know why.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.582
I have a beautiful wife,

14:35.667 --> 14:37.918
a beautiful life, it's slipping off my plate.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.879
Every day a little more.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.233
Hey.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.570
-Hard day?
-Same old.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.697
You?

15:06.781 --> 15:08.657
Just happy to be back.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.328
It's gonna be different now.
You know that, right?

15:14.289 --> 15:15.330
Why?

15:17.292 --> 15:18.458
Eddie.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.674
Remember that time
when I walked in on you guys...

15:25.758 --> 15:27.259
Oh, God. Zoey!

15:31.472 --> 15:33.265
-Good times.
-Yeah.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.310
Let's make this quick.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.520
So, thank you for having lunch with me.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.606
Go on.

15:41.816 --> 15:45.444
Lenny is so nice to me.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.447
Much, much, much nicer than I am to him.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.615
That's because he likes you.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.034
Yes. I am aware of that,

15:52.118 --> 15:53.827
which is why I've called this meeting.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.165
Clearly, we have sizzling chemistry.
Obviously.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.168
Actually, Zoey, it's not that obvious.

16:01.252 --> 16:04.004
But if it's obvious to you,
that's all that matters.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.547
He's into me.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.842
That's for sure.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.012
Get to your point.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.391
Should I hook up with him or not?

16:19.103 --> 16:21.271
You don't have a mother or a best friend

16:21.356 --> 16:23.106
or somebody you can be
having this conversation with?

16:23.191 --> 16:24.650
Yes, but they're all gossips.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.693
You know how to keep a secret.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.862
That is for sure.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.782
Private life is private life.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.159
We're not talking about me.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.372
My point exactly. So, what do I do?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.586
You have to see him every day.
It might become weird.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.214
It's already kind of weird.

16:47.298 --> 16:51.718
Then I would have to caution you
against fooling around with co-workers.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.137
And if you are still going to,

16:54.222 --> 16:57.015
then I would suggest
you slow down about it.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.851
But the heart wants what the heart wants!

17:00.311 --> 17:02.646
You know what I'm talking about.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.022
Actually, I don't.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.234
You and Eddie...

17:07.819 --> 17:08.902
Yes?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.279
...hooked up.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.324
Okay, Zoey, you know what? Yes.
You and Lenny in a back room

17:14.409 --> 17:17.828
on a cot somewhere
and someone like you can walk in on you.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.956
That's good stuff, very romantic,
and I wish you all the best.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.834
No, come back!

17:25.378 --> 17:27.838
Okay. Good talk. Thank you.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.342
This is the way it used to be.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.304
Hanging out in the back,
talking shit about nurses.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.472
Nice.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.225
Go easy on the nurse smack.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.854
How come you're not a doctor? Seriously.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.732
I could ask you the same thing.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.567
I am a doctor.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.861
No. I mean how come you're not a nurse?

17:53.448 --> 17:57.242
All the work, none of the pay, zero glory.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.786
I'd die.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.538
I'd be dead.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.706
Not true.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.583
-I have an awesome life.
-Yeah?

18:04.667 --> 18:07.210
But would I think it was awesome?

18:07.295 --> 18:10.297
I think you would. You should tag along
with me and my buddies after work.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.883
A little Coop reunion.
You can meet my lady,

18:12.967 --> 18:14.760
-see my world.
-Yeah.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.220
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.684
What should I wear?

18:25.229 --> 18:26.521
Is there anyone you want me to call?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.608
You could call my father
and he could yell at me

18:29.692 --> 18:31.318
for being an unwed mother.

18:32.695 --> 18:36.323
I had sex once in six years. Once.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.159
I'm 49. Did I mention that?

18:39.660 --> 18:40.869
You did.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.582
That's a very smart hat, by the way.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.919
I'm just going off what Diane Keaton did
in her last movie, you know.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.047
White bounces the light
and shaves off decades.

18:52.507 --> 18:56.343
Yes, well, nothing shaves off decades
like a stroller and a sippy cup.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.805
I never even thought about being a mother.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.183
Maybe one summer when I was 26,
I thought about how great it would be

19:03.267 --> 19:05.227
to have a bunch of kids.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.355
But, since then, never occurred to me.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.357
What about you?

19:12.235 --> 19:13.652
All my life.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.869
A divorce? You have lost your mind.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.204
Occupational hazard.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.790
The fact is, you don't make enough
to take care of him

19:26.874 --> 19:29.417
and you make too much
to qualify for Medicaid.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.046
This is who you wanted me to see?

19:33.130 --> 19:36.466
She's been fucking the system for 30 years.
I would listen to her.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.927
I didn't make the rules.
I don't even believe in them.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.387
I'm just passing on information.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.848
As a married couple,
your income is his income.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.642
And Medicaid will not help him
as long as he's tied to your assets.

19:45.726 --> 19:46.852
And you can quit your job,

19:46.936 --> 19:49.688
but then your whole family
is dependent on the state. It's your call.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.190
But he needs round-the-clock care.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.485
-I only make $52,000...
-The sooner you put this in motion,

19:55.570 --> 19:56.653
the better.

19:56.737 --> 20:00.448
His costs are gonna be catastrophic
as this thing plays out.

20:01.075 --> 20:05.078
Medicaid will cover it,
but not as long as you're in the picture.

20:05.162 --> 20:10.667
Today's visit alone, without the MRI,
would cost you $11,000.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.420
You're serious?

20:14.088 --> 20:15.213
Yeah, we are.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.008
You will lose your house.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.427
They'll garnish your income.

20:22.972 --> 20:26.683
To that end, All Saints would like to
take care of today

20:27.393 --> 20:30.020
and give him a clean bill of health,
so that you're only

20:30.104 --> 20:32.230
liable for future expenses.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.610
I promised to love him.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.780
You don't have to be married to love him.
It's just a piece of paper.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.949
Maybe to you.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.585
You wiped out her bill.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.546
My boy went to the University of Florida.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.256
Love the Gators.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.385
Yeah, we're getting too old for this shit.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.471
Speak for yourself.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.980
I don't care what they say,
you are not a grinchy little fucker.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.649
Who's "they"?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.943
That would be me.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.498
He used to get loaded,
and now he does this. Pretty cool, huh?

22:14.083 --> 22:15.458
Beyond cool.

22:16.752 --> 22:17.877
What?

22:20.131 --> 22:21.923
You wouldn't understand.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.091
Try me.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.469
Cool guys never like me.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.389
Never. I'm like the plague.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.351
They think I don't know it, but I do.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.369
It's all good. I'm a doctor.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.725
My name is Coop
Doo-dootily-doo

23:13.809 --> 23:16.269
I'm a doctor 'cause I got patients

23:16.353 --> 23:18.188
But I don't have patience

23:18.272 --> 23:20.732
For busted rhyme 'cause...

23:20.816 --> 23:24.360
Sometimes they're malignant
Sometimes they're benign

23:24.445 --> 23:26.446
I'm a... I hate nurses who whine

23:31.077 --> 23:33.703
I feel the flow and I see the light

23:33.788 --> 23:36.706
Don't trip, man
You're gonna have to breathe right

23:36.791 --> 23:39.709
Fuck! I told you, I'm a total knob.

23:39.794 --> 23:42.545
-I don't have a cool bone in my body.
-You look cool.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.006
-That's half the battle. Yeah.
-No, I don't... Yeah? You think so?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.466
Definitely.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.305
He'll be with these guys all night.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.227
You wanna bounce?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.145
Is that bad?

23:59.647 --> 24:02.107
-I can walk you home, if you want.
-Yeah?

24:02.191 --> 24:03.358
Yeah.

24:11.242 --> 24:12.700
Unacceptable.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.629
What are you people doing?

24:24.713 --> 24:27.298
People come to me with their guts
hanging out and I stuff them back in.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.759
I don't go sliding their appointments
around so I can lie on a beach

24:29.844 --> 24:31.261
-with my colleagues.
-Now hold on a minute.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.555
Why isn't anybody helping my friend?

24:35.766 --> 24:38.226
I don't know what Grace talked about
in her last session.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.894
I do not want you to break her confidence,

24:39.979 --> 24:43.231
but I'm just looking
for some advice at this point.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.567
My daughter is pulling her hair out.

24:45.651 --> 24:50.113
I don't know if she's telling you this stuff,
but this is what she's doing.

24:50.197 --> 24:53.533
I will pay you for your time,
I just, I don't know...

24:54.034 --> 24:56.202
Yes, I understand. I just...

24:56.829 --> 24:58.955
I just thought you should know.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.875
Okay. All right. Thank you.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.963
Oh, my God, you're in scrubs.
I need your help.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.299
I just called 911.
My boyfriend's having a seizure.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.470
-Is he epileptic?
-Yeah,

25:14.555 --> 25:16.472
but I've never seen him
have a seizure before.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.809
Can you give him some room?
Can I have your jacket?

25:21.729 --> 25:24.647
We just have to wait it out. He'll be okay.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.989
Get outside and wait for EMS, please.
Can you step back?

25:33.073 --> 25:36.910
Listen, you are not helping him.
He needs calm. Go. I got it.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.543
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.962
Roxicodone...

25:48.422 --> 25:49.797
Holy shit!

25:51.091 --> 25:53.551
Are you a dealer?
You a fucking doctor? What?

25:54.345 --> 25:56.095
Oh, God forgive me.

25:58.432 --> 25:59.807
It's okay. You'll be all right.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.900
You're okay.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.783
There's no Jackie Peyton in the system.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.286
My mistake.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.872
I don't know whose MRI you saw,
but it wasn't hers.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.958
Because if she had an MRI,
it would be here.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.209
Yes, I understand that.

26:26.293 --> 26:29.629
I can't do more than apologize
and say "my mistake."

26:33.008 --> 26:35.635
-Where are you taking him?
-All Saints.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.096
He should go to Bellevue.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.306
Can we take him to Bellevue?

26:40.391 --> 26:41.599
All Saints is closer.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.646
Bellevue is better. Trust me.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.440
We want to go to Bellevue.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.526
Do what she wants.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.819
Bellevue.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.241
My God, thank you so much.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.286
You don't have to thank me. It's what I do.
