19:28.233 --> 19:30.235
going to have to eat.

19:32.237 --> 19:35.740
You're not making this...
any easier, you know.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.241
Uh, Benson, please, sit down.

19:37.242 --> 19:38.743
Come on, sit down, right here.

19:38.744 --> 19:39.744
I've got a surprise for you.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.245
What?

19:41.246 --> 19:43.248
A goodbye cake.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.251
Did you make it?

19:47.252 --> 19:48.753
Well, of course.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.756
Do I have to eat it?

19:52.758 --> 19:54.258
You're my best friend, Benson.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.261
Then why are you trying
to poison me?

19:57.763 --> 20:00.264
You're my best friend too,
Mrs. Tate.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.767
That doesn't have to stop, huh?

20:02.768 --> 20:05.270
No.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.781
Well?

20:18.784 --> 20:20.284
Different.

20:20.285 --> 20:23.788
I knew you'd like it.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.291
Um...

20:27.292 --> 20:28.793
you know...

20:28.794 --> 20:30.795
I didn't take that job
at the governor's mansion

20:30.796 --> 20:32.797
because I'm unhappy here.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.298
Oh, Benson, I know that.

20:34.299 --> 20:37.802
I mean, my goodness,
running the governor's mansion

20:37.803 --> 20:39.804
is a wonderful opportunity
for you,

20:39.805 --> 20:41.806
and they need you.

20:41.807 --> 20:42.807
I mean, this side of the family

20:42.808 --> 20:45.309
has a minor snafu
once in awhile,

20:45.310 --> 20:48.312
but <i>they</i> have problems.

20:48.313 --> 20:50.314
Well...

20:50.315 --> 20:51.816
I'm glad you understand.

20:51.817 --> 20:54.318
That always was
the screwy side of the family,

20:54.319 --> 20:55.319
the Gatlings.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.321
Very screwy.

20:57.322 --> 20:58.823
And very rich.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.825
You know, my great-great-
great-grandfather,

21:00.826 --> 21:03.828
he made a killing
in haberdashery.

21:03.829 --> 21:07.331
He... He invented those tall hats
that the Pilgrims wore.

21:07.332 --> 21:08.833
[SNIFFLES]

21:12.337 --> 21:13.838
Come...

21:13.839 --> 21:16.340
Don't do that, Mrs. Tate.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.342
No, I won't.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.344
Because if you do, I will.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.847
Oh, gosh, you mustn't.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.348
I'm not.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.350
[SNIFFLES]

21:26.351 --> 21:28.853
Well, me neither.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.358
Oh, Benson...

21:34.359 --> 21:36.361
[SOBBING]

21:43.869 --> 21:44.870
[SIGHS]

21:47.873 --> 21:50.374
[QUIETLY]
Bye-bye.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.877
Goodbye.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.895
It's really very good.
