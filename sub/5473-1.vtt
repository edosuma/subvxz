01:03.663 --> 01:04.891
You're dead, bitch!

01:14.607 --> 01:16.404
What the hell you lookin' at?

01:31.357 --> 01:33.257
Fuckin' hell.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.573
Looks like you are
shit outta luck, beautiful.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.672
Now I'm gonna give you
your C-section.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.574
You son of a bi...

01:59.252 --> 02:00.776
Eat your vegetables.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.447
She's in here!

02:02.489 --> 02:03.922
Come on!

02:05.158 --> 02:06.523
Where is she?

02:09.662 --> 02:10.753
There she is!

02:12.432 --> 02:13.990
- get out of here!
- Over there!

02:15.735 --> 02:17.100
Kill her on sight!

02:22.876 --> 02:24.241
Who the fuck is that?

02:24.277 --> 02:25.972
Where the hell is the girl?

02:26.012 --> 02:28.310
# I'm afraid, I'm afraid,
I'm afraid #

02:28.348 --> 02:30.282
# Of ghosts #

02:30.316 --> 02:31.613
# If you have #

02:31.651 --> 02:33.118
get him!

02:33.153 --> 02:34.620
# I don't mean to stare #

02:34.654 --> 02:36.144
# We don't have to breed #

02:36.189 --> 02:38.282
# We can plant a house
we can build a tree #

02:39.058 --> 02:41.288
# I don't even care,
"We could have all three" #

02:41.327 --> 02:43.386
- Jesus!
- # She said #

02:43.429 --> 02:44.521
# She said #

02:44.564 --> 02:48.159
# She said #
#She said #

02:48.201 --> 02:50.863
# She said, she said #

02:50.904 --> 02:51.893
# She said #

02:51.938 --> 02:53.462
- Oh, god! Fuck!
- # She said #

02:53.506 --> 02:55.406
# She said #

02:55.441 --> 03:00.572
# She said, she said #

03:06.986 --> 03:09.352
Come on, push. Push!

03:16.462 --> 03:17.656
My hand!

03:19.866 --> 03:21.993
- Do you know what I hate?
- No.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.562
I hate these 40-year-old jack-holes
wearing ponytails.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.167
- That ponytail doesn't make you look hip...
- Come on.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.109
...young, or cool.

03:32.245 --> 03:35.009
OK, it's comin'. Come on.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.106
give me one big push.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.276
# She said, she said #

03:38.318 --> 03:42.118
# She said, she said #

03:42.155 --> 03:43.349
# She said #

03:44.624 --> 03:46.922
# She said #

03:48.061 --> 03:49.426
What the fuck?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.900
I'm bleedin'. I'm bleedin' out.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.098
Quit squirming,
you're ruining my shot.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.870
What a piece of crap.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.610
We're outta here.

04:16.221 --> 04:18.349
Sorry about
the messy delivery, Mom.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.230
We need quiet.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.428
give Junior something to drink.

04:53.092 --> 04:56.061
Bravo, Mr. Hero. Bravo.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.687
Why you tryin' to kill this woman?

05:00.066 --> 05:01.533
Something funny?

05:01.567 --> 05:04.058
Oh, I was just remembering
a limerick.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.594
Well, "There once was a woman
who was quite begat...

05:06.639 --> 05:09.369
"She had three babies
named Nat, Pat and Tat...

05:09.409 --> 05:10.876
"She said it was fun
at the breeding...

05:10.910 --> 05:13.310
"But found it was hell
in the feeding...

05:13.346 --> 05:16.907
"When she saw there was
no tit for Tat."

05:16.949 --> 05:20.077
You have caused me
no end of trouble.

05:20.119 --> 05:22.485
But now I shall return the favor.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.285
Tit for tat, right?

05:25.758 --> 05:28.659
Now, see, that's the latest thing.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.492
The gun will only fire
when it recognizes...

05:30.530 --> 05:32.122
the thumbprint of the owner.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.532
It makes firearms safer
and it cuts down the crime too.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.696
get him!

05:47.847 --> 05:49.474
Who are you?

05:49.515 --> 05:51.881
Lady, what's your name?

06:49.809 --> 06:51.208
Nice knockers.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.377
# I said the joker
is a wanted man #

06:59.419 --> 07:02.445
# He makes his way
all across the land #

07:02.488 --> 07:03.750
# See him sifting
through the sand #

07:03.790 --> 07:05.155
god damn it!

07:05.191 --> 07:06.351
# So I'll tell you all the story #

07:06.392 --> 07:08.155
# About the joker
and the thief of the night #

07:14.434 --> 07:17.631
# He's always laughing
in the midst of power #

07:17.670 --> 07:20.537
# Always living in the final hour #

07:20.573 --> 07:23.736
# There is always
sweet in the sour #

07:23.776 --> 07:25.835
Fuck you, ya fuckin' fuckers.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.136
Tit for tat, Mr. Hero.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.797
Tit for tat.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.841
grab his legs.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.243
get him in there. Come on.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.247
I was goin' back for her, boss.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.409
No, I got it.

08:05.451 --> 08:08.181
Hey, I'm not the head honcho
who sits on his hands...

08:08.221 --> 08:09.779
warming them
with his own exhaust...

08:09.822 --> 08:11.221
while everybody else
does the work.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.054
Every second counts, right?

08:17.597 --> 08:20.361
Now, how the heck
did this happen, huh?

08:25.137 --> 08:27.037
Everything was goin' smooth
at the safe house...

08:27.673 --> 08:28.901
...when the woman draws a gun.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.933
I mean, who expects a pregnant
lady to pull a piece on ya, eh?

08:31.978 --> 08:34.275
And who was this man
who was with her?

08:34.313 --> 08:35.712
I don't know.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.682
After the woman escaped,
we tracked her here.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.207
This guy, he was hangin' around...

08:39.251 --> 08:40.480
at the bus stop.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.385
I mean, so we decided
that we'd deal with him later...

08:42.421 --> 08:43.820
but we go after the woman...

08:43.856 --> 08:45.915
he gets in on the action. You know?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.256
He took a gun,
he started shootin' at us,

08:48.294 --> 08:49.727
and that's...
that's when y...

08:49.762 --> 08:51.093
- Oh. OK.
...you arrived.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.098
Take it easy. Sit down.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.292
All right.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.561
Oh, you all right?

08:55.935 --> 08:57.197
OK.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.794
Are you tryin' to tell me...

08:59.839 --> 09:03.297
that some bum
came to her rescue?

09:03.342 --> 09:06.368
Well, well, well,
this is a fine mess, huh?

09:06.979 --> 09:08.776
I won't make
this mistake again.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.907
Well, I got a piece of lead
in my butt as a reminder.

09:11.951 --> 09:12.975
OK.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.681
I can appreciate that.

09:16.455 --> 09:17.945
My ass!

09:18.824 --> 09:21.418
And let that be a reminder
never to fail me again.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.119
Damn.

11:08.968 --> 11:10.959
Don't make me kill you
to get the baby.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.526
Back off.

12:58.344 --> 13:01.711
Sweetie, this deal is almost done.

13:01.747 --> 13:05.183
Look, I've already booked
my flight home.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.048
OK?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.678
OK.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.712
I love you too.

13:10.756 --> 13:12.587
Yeah. Bye-bye.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.358
You know why a gun
is better than a wife?

13:20.266 --> 13:21.255
Don't know.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.827
Well, you can put
a silencer on a gun.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.270
Sir, we spotted the target...

13:32.311 --> 13:34.279
at Third and Jefferson heading
toward the park.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.337
Turn us around.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.451
Come on! Dad!

13:42.488 --> 13:45.082
- Come on.
- All right.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.217
Who's Daddy's little girl?

14:05.978 --> 14:09.345
Don't worry, kid.
Someone good'll find you.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.023
Oh, my god, look at this.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.922
Someone left a baby.

14:32.071 --> 14:33.060
Oops.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.696
Fuck me sideways.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.495
Welcome back, Mr. Smith.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.024
Where's Quintana?

15:37.069 --> 15:40.095
Wait, Smith, Mistress Donna's
with a customer.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.163
Wait, you can't go up there.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.537
Oh, yeah, baby.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.337
- Smith?
- You like that, huh?

15:44.376 --> 15:46.401
Besides, I thought Mistress Mary
was more your type.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.242
You can't go up there.

15:49.748 --> 15:54.447
# I've got a bad boy
and that's all right with me #

15:57.957 --> 15:59.515
- # His dirty laundry #
- Come 'ere!

15:59.558 --> 16:02.391
# Is nothing that
I can't keep clean #

16:05.230 --> 16:08.165
# And when he needs an alibi... #

16:12.671 --> 16:14.468
# Money #

16:14.506 --> 16:16.770
# Money makes the world
go round #

16:16.809 --> 16:18.037
# Money #

16:18.077 --> 16:20.409
# Money make you
change your sound #

16:20.446 --> 16:25.110
# If the price is right,
if the price is right #

16:28.253 --> 16:31.245
Sorry, pal, the bar's closed.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.683
# If you want gold and silver #

16:33.726 --> 16:35.626
# Sooner or later... #

16:37.429 --> 16:39.659
# Don't need to know yourself
too well #

16:39.698 --> 16:41.393
Wait your turn, Smith.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.730
There's plenty to go around.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.737
Not for me, thanks.
I'm lactose intolerant.

16:45.771 --> 16:48.171
Just tell me
what you want, Smith.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.407
# If you want shelter #

16:55.447 --> 16:56.812
# If you want smoke
then you better #

16:56.849 --> 16:58.783
# Take off your sweater #

17:00.185 --> 17:01.174
Kinky.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.018
I want you to take care of this
baby for a while.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.318
Five grand.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.415
That should keep you off your
back for a couple of weeks.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.559
Are you clean?

17:11.597 --> 17:14.430
You know
I'm a good girl Scout.

17:14.465 --> 17:15.523
So you'll do it.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.661
<i>Vaffanculo.</i>
Screw yourself, Smith.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.172
For all I know,
you snatched the kid.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.106
I don't want to be an accessory
for kidnapping.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.871
I didn't steal the kid, trust me.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.070
Trust you?

17:27.112 --> 17:30.275
I don't even know your real name.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.907
Who are you really, Smith?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.876
I'm a British nanny...

17:34.920 --> 17:36.217
and I'm dangerous.

17:46.131 --> 17:50.124
Just keep the baby for one day
and you can keep the whole roll.

18:03.816 --> 18:04.942
Forget it, Dad.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.049
Fine.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.492
<i>Ciao.</i>

19:09.481 --> 19:11.039
Breast milk.

19:14.586 --> 19:15.712
Let's go.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.319
This lady's baby needs to be fed.

19:18.357 --> 19:21.155
Find me every wet nurse,
lactating hooker...

19:21.193 --> 19:23.627
and mammary on tap
in the city.

19:26.064 --> 19:28.931
I already told you, Smith,
you're not welcome...

19:28.967 --> 19:30.867
in the land of milk and honey.

19:34.039 --> 19:37.440
I need a little cream for
my coffee and some answers.

19:40.112 --> 19:43.081
I'm sorry.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.715
Scram, fellas.

19:46.752 --> 19:50.119
give me a moment alone
here with, uh...

19:50.155 --> 19:52.316
<i>Caffé La Mamma.</i>

19:52.357 --> 19:56.054
Relax. Relax.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.530
<i>Mia piccola troietta.</i>

20:05.304 --> 20:10.469
There was a man here
with a baby not too long ago.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.568
Yes. A real jerk.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.270
He wanted me
to take care of the kid.

20:17.749 --> 20:20.115
And what is this man's name?

20:20.919 --> 20:22.682
Smith.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.655
Mr. Smith.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.059
How the hell
do I know his real name?

20:32.097 --> 20:34.224
He saw me a couple of times...

20:34.266 --> 20:36.393
when I was pulling straight tricks.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.869
He always used
the same name... Smith.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.730
I don't believe you.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.907
I think you know
more about this man.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.285
He was a lousy tipper.

20:58.156 --> 21:01.148
It gets hotter the more times it's fired.

21:05.697 --> 21:08.461
If I had anything on him,
I'd tell you.

21:14.973 --> 21:19.672
And it gets a lot more
painful the closer I get.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.613
What's up, Doc?

21:26.652 --> 21:30.179
Oh, you're a "wascally wabbit."

21:33.125 --> 21:35.355
But you're not "wascally" enough.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.487
Yeah?

21:37.529 --> 21:39.463
That's a six-shooter.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.291
I just counted six shots.

21:43.735 --> 21:46.135
You've blown your load.

21:52.344 --> 21:53.834
Yeah, well, what about you?

21:53.879 --> 21:56.712
Your 9-millimeter is empty too.

21:56.748 --> 21:59.945
Yeah, you fired 8 on the rooftop,
one in the men's room...

21:59.985 --> 22:02.977
and your second cartridge
was expended at the playground.

22:03.021 --> 22:05.717
And you won't be getting it up
with that gun you took off my man.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.918
Oh, no. Well, you see,
like my weapon...

22:07.959 --> 22:11.053
it also has the thumbprint
safety device.

22:11.096 --> 22:12.893
Oh, really?

22:13.865 --> 22:15.127
Wanna bet?

22:34.720 --> 22:36.813
Nothin' like a good hand job.

22:46.765 --> 22:49.996
get your things. We're goin'.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.370
I don't understand a word
you're going on about...

22:59.411 --> 23:02.380
but I know exactly what you're saying
and I refuse to apologize.

23:02.414 --> 23:05.383
Damn you, Smith. I could have
been snuffed back there.

23:05.417 --> 23:08.079
Yeah, you should be thanking me
for saving your sweet back door.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.281
Why did you wait so goddamn long?

23:10.322 --> 23:12.347
You're a bad girl,
you deserve to be punished.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.359
Which car do you want?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.588
- What?
- I'm tired of walking.

23:18.663 --> 23:20.426
Look at this.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.367
You wanna know the difference...

23:26.405 --> 23:29.238
between this luxury car
and a porcupine?

23:29.274 --> 23:30.332
I give up.

23:31.777 --> 23:34.041
With the car,
the pricks are on the inside.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.371
Tell me about it.

23:54.399 --> 23:56.162
Hello, honey.

23:57.803 --> 23:59.270
Oh, good, good, I'm glad...

23:59.304 --> 24:01.534
I'm glad you liked the flowers.
good.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.342
Listen, sweetie...

24:04.376 --> 24:06.776
I've run into a small hitch.

24:08.747 --> 24:11.443
I think I'm gonna have to be
out here for a while longer.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.781
But don't worry.

24:13.819 --> 24:16.117
I will be back in time
for Timmy's birthday party...

24:16.154 --> 24:17.781
I swear to you.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.552
Hugs and kisses.

24:19.591 --> 24:21.252
Bye-bye.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.123
So, what was I supposed to do?

24:24.162 --> 24:26.255
These guys were stalking
this pregnant lady.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.458
I couldn't just stand there.

24:29.935 --> 24:32.563
Did you see that?
I fuckin' hate that.

24:32.604 --> 24:34.333
- What?
- This guy, changin' lanes...

24:34.372 --> 24:35.600
without signaling.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.574
I mean, how hard is it
to use your signal?

24:39.377 --> 24:41.811
So you started shooting at them?

24:41.847 --> 24:44.179
No, I don't carry a piece.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.150
I went to the woman. She had a gun.

24:46.184 --> 24:48.311
They started firing, I shot back.

24:48.353 --> 24:50.446
He's done it again.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.480
I move my finger one inch...

24:52.524 --> 24:53.991
to use my turn signal.

24:54.025 --> 24:55.515
Why are these assholes so lazy...

24:55.560 --> 24:58.495
they can't move their finger
one fucking measly inch...

24:58.530 --> 24:59.895
to drive more safely?

25:00.866 --> 25:02.959
- You wanna know why?
- Not particularly.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.366
Because these rich bastards
have to...

25:04.402 --> 25:05.994
be callous and inconsiderate
in the first place...

25:06.037 --> 25:07.732
to make all that money,
so when they get on the road...

25:07.772 --> 25:09.171
they can't help themselves.
They've gotta be...

25:09.207 --> 25:11.368
callous and inconsiderate
drivers too.

25:11.409 --> 25:12.467
It's in their nature.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.240
Why don't you take the baby
to the police?

25:14.279 --> 25:17.009
- I can't go to the police.
- Why not?

25:17.048 --> 25:18.572
I'm the Unabomber.

25:18.617 --> 25:20.551
They caught the Unabomber.

25:20.585 --> 25:21.677
That's what they think.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.754
Stupid...

25:24.789 --> 25:26.416
Right. That's it.

25:36.768 --> 25:39.032
You are the angriest man
in the world.

25:39.070 --> 25:42.403
If I remember right,
you used to like it like that.

25:45.777 --> 25:48.109
Well, how many freelancers
have you got?

25:49.414 --> 25:51.644
Yeah? How many local boys?

25:52.717 --> 25:54.412
I need men, you understand?

25:56.254 --> 25:57.846
I need a lot more men.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.028
# Look out, baby #

26:11.069 --> 26:12.627
# Listen to my song #

26:13.905 --> 26:15.304
I want four mags...

26:15.340 --> 26:18.241
a box of 9-millimeter
147 hollow-points...

26:19.711 --> 26:21.576
...and give me 50 FMJs.

26:28.153 --> 26:29.848
You're a little short.

26:29.888 --> 26:33.790
You lied. You said you had $5,000.

26:33.825 --> 26:36.157
How about we make up the
difference with food stamps?

26:36.194 --> 26:38.685
You wanna buy bullets
with food stamps?

26:38.730 --> 26:39.754
It's as good as cash.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.425
You're pathetic, Smith.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.991
We'll wait for you outside.

26:44.035 --> 26:46.970
Look, why don't I sign over this check
I got at the blood bank to you?

26:47.005 --> 26:49.064
It'll more than cover it.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.268
Throw in that check you got
from the sperm bank...

26:51.309 --> 26:52.833
and got yourself a deal.

26:52.877 --> 26:54.811
I don't get that check
till Wednesday.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.642
Listen, why don't you take
a half-a box of shells...

26:57.682 --> 26:58.876
and I'll give you the other half...

26:58.917 --> 27:00.817
when you bring me the rest
of the money on Wednesday.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.410
Deal.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.439
Damn it, Smith!

27:30.482 --> 27:31.847
What the hell are you doing?

27:31.883 --> 27:33.145
Making some money.

27:33.184 --> 27:34.708
- Making some money?
- Well, yeah.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.778
To buy something for the baby.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.516
Something for the baby?

27:42.894 --> 27:46.295
A bulletproof vest is a better
investment than a crib.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.960
Makes me think what you'd do
to get him in the right school.

27:53.438 --> 27:54.462
So this is it.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.067
It's not the Ritz but it's home.

27:59.377 --> 28:01.242
Same old Smith.

28:01.279 --> 28:02.507
Down and dirty.

28:02.547 --> 28:04.708
glad you like it.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.085
Say hello to Mickey.

28:23.168 --> 28:25.432
Maybe I should take the baby
to the police.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.062
No, you'd never make it.

28:27.105 --> 28:28.595
They'll be watching
all the precincts...

28:28.640 --> 28:30.938
probably got some of the boys in blue
on payola too.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.015
I've rounded up 50 guys.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.753
Well, I guess that's just
gonna have to do, huh?

28:57.969 --> 29:00.403
Stop the car. He was here.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.303
Come on, what makes
you think he was here?

29:02.340 --> 29:05.104
Trust me. I know what people do
and I know what people think.

29:05.143 --> 29:08.601
I always have.
Even as a kid, I had this gift.

29:08.646 --> 29:10.910
Yeah, you shoulda seen
the playground hurt I laid down...

29:10.949 --> 29:12.917
playin' rock, paper, scissors, buddy.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.112
Now stop the car.

29:16.221 --> 29:18.416
Who do you think
wants this baby dead?

29:18.456 --> 29:20.754
I've no idea who's tryin' to kill it.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.623
Don't call him an "it."

29:22.660 --> 29:24.321
It's an "it" to me.

29:28.333 --> 29:31.268
Tell me, Smith,
is there anything you like?

29:31.302 --> 29:33.429
Yeah, my privacy.

29:38.176 --> 29:40.838
Tell me something I don't know
<i>per una volta...</i>

29:40.879 --> 29:42.278
<i>brutto figlio di puttana bastardo.</i>

29:42.313 --> 29:44.838
I love it when you talk like that.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.615
Can I offer you anything?

29:49.254 --> 29:50.653
Carrot?

29:52.190 --> 29:54.124
It's good for your eyesight.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.464
Of all the squats in the city...

30:00.498 --> 30:02.432
how does he know
Smith's in this one?

30:02.467 --> 30:04.059
Another lucky guess?

30:04.102 --> 30:05.865
Nah, he doesn't guess.

30:05.904 --> 30:07.838
He sees things we don't.

30:07.872 --> 30:10.864
He was once an FBI profiler.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.776
Forensic behavior consultant.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.781
My god, how many times
do I have to tell you guys?

30:16.815 --> 30:18.282
Details...

30:19.818 --> 30:23.379
...make all the difference
in this business.

30:23.421 --> 30:24.945
Hey, but...

30:25.857 --> 30:27.950
Don't... you think
you should hang back, sir?

30:27.992 --> 30:30.927
The leader who stays in the rear,
takes it in the rear.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.598
Besides...

30:41.973 --> 30:44.703
violence is one of
the most fun things to watch.

30:45.743 --> 30:47.040
No, no, no, baby, no.

30:47.078 --> 30:48.739
We could call him Oliver.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.340
- Oliver?
- Yeah, like Oliver Twist.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.077
Because he's an orphan?

30:53.117 --> 30:54.243
'Cause I like the book.

30:54.285 --> 30:56.378
- You like the book.
- I didn't hate it.

30:56.421 --> 30:58.116
That's a first.

31:03.294 --> 31:05.990
Which birthday card do
you think I should go with here?

31:06.998 --> 31:08.556
Cute and cuddly?

31:09.133 --> 31:12.159
Or the one that says,
"You're becomin' a man now, son"?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.535
So, Mr. Hertz?

31:17.575 --> 31:18.974
How old is your son?

31:19.010 --> 31:20.568
He's 8.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.012
Then it had to be
large and powerful and...

31:23.915 --> 31:25.542
Can you believe it?

31:25.583 --> 31:26.675
There's nothing on the TV...

31:26.718 --> 31:28.379
- about any of this.
...without a trace.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.781
...roadside bomb wounded...

31:33.825 --> 31:35.019
We have it in our...

31:37.862 --> 31:40.126
Hey. Do you notice that?

31:40.164 --> 31:41.597
Notice what?

31:41.633 --> 31:43.396
Look.

31:43.434 --> 31:47.894
Lame-ass politician rants about
gun control, he cries.

31:49.173 --> 31:50.435
- So tonight...
- Switch to this channel...

31:50.475 --> 31:51.635
with this heavy metal music...

31:54.112 --> 31:55.204
...he shuts up.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.847
That's so weird.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.881
He must find it comforting.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.389
- Sir?
- Yeah?

32:05.423 --> 32:09.052
- Men are in place on the roof.
- That's good.

32:09.093 --> 32:12.551
Anybody know what a
Jimmy Cagney love scene is?

32:13.698 --> 32:15.791
It's where Cagney
lets the good guy live.

32:20.004 --> 32:23.735
And if that happens in this show...

32:23.775 --> 32:26.437
I'm gonna do a lot more
than ask for my money back.

32:26.477 --> 32:30.538
All right? Let's kill this mother. go.

32:33.818 --> 32:37.015
It doesn't surprise me that
Oliver's into death metal.

32:37.055 --> 32:38.750
Look at his surrogate parents.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.452
No, I'm telling ya, this means...

32:43.361 --> 32:44.760
go. Back way.

32:55.373 --> 32:56.601
# If you like to gamble #

32:56.641 --> 32:58.336
# I tell you I'm your man #

32:58.376 --> 33:02.142
# You win some, lose some,
it's still the same to me #

33:08.786 --> 33:10.481
# Playing for the high one #

33:10.521 --> 33:11.681
# Dancing with the devil #

33:11.723 --> 33:13.816
# going with the flow #

33:13.858 --> 33:15.792
# It's all a game to me #

33:22.066 --> 33:23.863
# Seven or eleven #

33:23.901 --> 33:25.801
# Snake eyes watching you #

33:29.007 --> 33:30.702
# Double up or quit #

33:30.742 --> 33:32.209
# Double stake or split #

33:32.243 --> 33:35.804
# The ace of spades,
the ace of spades #

33:42.186 --> 33:43.653
# You know I'm born to lose #

33:43.688 --> 33:45.087
# And gambling's for fools #

33:45.623 --> 33:47.614
# But that's the way I like it, baby #

33:47.658 --> 33:50.559
# I don't wanna live forever #

33:56.334 --> 33:58.495
# And don't forget the joker #

34:25.362 --> 34:26.920
# Pushing up the ante #

34:26.964 --> 34:28.931
# I know you've got to see me #

34:28.966 --> 34:30.364
# Read 'em and weep #

34:30.400 --> 34:32.630
# The dead man's hand again #

34:38.810 --> 34:40.641
# I see it in your eyes #

34:40.678 --> 34:43.043
# Take one look and die #

34:45.882 --> 34:47.714
# The only thing you see #

34:47.752 --> 34:49.150
# You know it's gonna be #

34:49.187 --> 34:50.710
# The ace of spades #

34:50.755 --> 34:52.813
# The ace of spades #

35:12.810 --> 35:15.244
My god, do we really suck...

35:15.279 --> 35:17.509
or is this guy really that good?

35:17.548 --> 35:19.140
Come on, boys!

35:19.183 --> 35:21.083
He ain't out of the briar patch yet!

35:40.138 --> 35:42.003
Shoot the dog, shoot the dog.

35:42.039 --> 35:43.301
No.

35:44.742 --> 35:46.767
- Why not?
- I like dogs.

36:08.266 --> 36:09.995
Wait a minute.

36:12.904 --> 36:15.805
Oh, that rat bastard.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.248
What is it?

36:32.924 --> 36:34.289
It's the baby's diaper.

36:39.297 --> 36:41.697
This idea blows, Smith.

36:41.732 --> 36:43.222
It's the only idea we got.

36:43.267 --> 36:45.758
You actually think
that Oliver's mother...

36:45.803 --> 36:47.896
lived near a heavy metal club...

36:47.939 --> 36:51.375
...and that he could hear the music
while he was still inside the womb?

36:51.409 --> 36:52.808
Yep. That's why he doesn't cry...

36:52.843 --> 36:54.708
when he's listenin' to some
headbanger's bash.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.042
Ridiculous.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.079
Well, he isn't cryin' now.

37:01.719 --> 37:05.382
So this is the only club near where
I encountered the baby's mother.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.891
I still say this is a wild hunch.

37:07.925 --> 37:10.257
Yeah? So how do you explain
all these boxes of diapers?

37:10.294 --> 37:12.159
Somebody's been stocking up.

37:12.196 --> 37:13.959
Let's find out who.

37:16.133 --> 37:19.296
# You sear my legs,
song birds cheer #

37:19.337 --> 37:21.237
# Eat my neck #

37:21.272 --> 37:23.240
# I can't,
I can't let it go grey #

37:23.274 --> 37:26.175
# I can't break, I can't break #

37:26.210 --> 37:31.170
# I can't break,
I can't break, I can't break #

37:31.215 --> 37:34.082
- You the owner of this place?
- Who's askin'?

37:34.118 --> 37:35.676
I am.

37:37.888 --> 37:40.322
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.124
Just as I suspected.

37:45.162 --> 37:47.562
He really is into jewelry.

37:51.135 --> 37:52.659
Who occupies the room upstairs?

37:52.703 --> 37:54.102
go to hell.

37:54.138 --> 37:55.628
Don't mess with me.

37:55.673 --> 37:57.504
You ain't got the <i>cojones.</i>

38:00.278 --> 38:01.802
Oh, god.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.212
So who were these guys?

38:05.249 --> 38:09.151
I rented the place to some suit
11 months ago.

38:09.186 --> 38:11.711
He paid the whole year in cash.

38:11.756 --> 38:13.223
I never saw him again.

38:13.257 --> 38:15.623
I just figured they were
usin' the back way.

38:21.899 --> 38:23.594
Beat it.

38:38.949 --> 38:40.348
<i>Oh, madonna.</i>

38:41.752 --> 38:42.844
<i>Che orrore!</i>

38:43.487 --> 38:45.352
This is pretty fucked up.

39:15.319 --> 39:17.480
Sir, it's your go-to guy.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.054
All the mothers have been killed.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.525
Only one escaped, temporarily.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.996
We found her body and confirmed
that she did deliver a child.

39:27.298 --> 39:28.925
The babies were supposed
to be delivered covertly.

39:28.966 --> 39:30.661
I guess setting up this
maternity factory...

39:30.701 --> 39:33.693
on top of a heavy metal club
wasn't particularly secret.

39:33.738 --> 39:36.536
What a fine lot of
babysitters we turned out to be.

39:36.574 --> 39:39.304
When Mr. go-To guy passes,
head to the left.

39:39.343 --> 39:40.935
Yes, sir, I already made the call.

39:40.978 --> 39:43.640
Backup should be
arriving any minute.

39:43.681 --> 39:45.444
We'll clean this mess up
and try to piece together...

39:45.483 --> 39:46.677
everything that happened.

39:47.852 --> 39:50.946
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate your confidence.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.614
gentlemen, let's find some answers.

39:58.763 --> 40:01.129
Watch where you step.

40:01.165 --> 40:04.362
- The ice cream is melting.
- What?

40:04.402 --> 40:06.802
I thought donor sperm
was your department.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.203
These freezers are full of samples.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.739
This is weird.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.574
There seems to be only one donor.

40:14.612 --> 40:16.136
One donor?

40:16.180 --> 40:18.546
Yeah. And a generous one at that.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.121
This is bone marrow blood.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.185
It must be for some kind of cure.

40:33.230 --> 40:34.663
How do you know that, Smith?

40:34.698 --> 40:36.598
You didn't hear about
my Nobel Prize?

40:44.375 --> 40:48.106
See, what it is, it's hard to find marrow
that matches that of the recipient.

40:48.145 --> 40:50.511
The odds are much better
if the donor marrow shares...

40:50.548 --> 40:53.108
the same DNA with
the person receiving it.

40:54.552 --> 40:57.419
You mean these people were
harvesting babies...

40:57.455 --> 40:59.787
for some guy's
bone marrow transplant?

40:59.824 --> 41:03.021
Exactly. And somebody
wanted to make sure he didn't get it.

41:03.527 --> 41:05.791
That's why they want Oliver dead.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.286
No, my baby, no.

41:34.859 --> 41:37.259
So I called that guy I know at NBC.

41:37.294 --> 41:38.886
That's good.

41:39.730 --> 41:41.129
And then I got to thinking.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.998
- You know what I hate?
- Here we go again.

41:44.034 --> 41:45.695
I hate those lame action movies...

41:45.736 --> 41:48.364
where the good guy calls
just one person who ends up betrayin' him.

41:49.039 --> 41:52.736
Yeah. That's right up there
with killing baby seals.

41:52.776 --> 41:56.644
I called ABC, CBS,
<i>The Post, The Times...</i>

41:56.680 --> 41:59.148
the local news channel, and the FBI.

42:00.918 --> 42:02.909
So, what do we do next?

42:02.953 --> 42:04.944
I figure we hang here
and watch the news.

42:04.989 --> 42:07.719
Once the story goes public,
maybe we'll be safe.

42:09.059 --> 42:12.153
Look. He finally went to sleep.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.823
Yeah, you just wait.

42:13.864 --> 42:17.459
The moment you close
your eyes for a nap, he'll start screaming.

42:17.501 --> 42:20.937
You can't take a little pleasure
in anything, can you?

42:20.971 --> 42:22.996
You just hate everything.

42:23.607 --> 42:24.665
I don't hate you.

42:25.509 --> 42:26.999
Is that why you picked me?

42:27.044 --> 42:28.204
You know why I picked you.

42:29.113 --> 42:31.547
You have no idea
what you've done to me.

42:31.582 --> 42:33.812
We're gonna get out of this, trust me.

42:33.851 --> 42:36.786
- You just don't get it.
- What?

42:38.422 --> 42:44.588
You bring me this child
so I can feed him, take care of him.

42:44.628 --> 42:47.791
A baby that could be dead
at any moment.

42:47.831 --> 42:50.095
And you never even think
to ask me...

42:50.134 --> 42:52.034
what happened to my own child.

42:57.107 --> 42:58.734
You're right.

43:01.178 --> 43:02.543
It's unforgivable.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.143
No. It's my fault.

43:08.919 --> 43:11.945
It's like what my <i>mamma</i>
always said...

43:11.989 --> 43:15.789
<i>" Le uova non devono ballare</i>
<i>con le pietre. "</i>

43:15.826 --> 43:18.886
If I say I'm sorry will
you tell me what that means?

43:20.030 --> 43:23.431
Eggs have no business
dancing with stones.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.656
You know, Smith...

43:49.693 --> 43:52.992
I figured out what you hate most...

43:53.030 --> 43:54.622
yourself.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.466
What happened to your baby?

43:59.503 --> 44:01.266
Forget about it.

44:01.305 --> 44:02.897
Tell me.

44:03.774 --> 44:06.334
My pimp hit me in the stomach.

44:07.578 --> 44:09.443
My baby...

44:09.480 --> 44:11.505
was delivered stillborn.

44:16.186 --> 44:17.813
- get off of me!
- Hey.

44:34.905 --> 44:36.463
You like this, do ya?

44:40.778 --> 44:43.747
It's called a gun.

44:43.781 --> 44:49.310
grip, slide, breech, barrel, trigger.

44:49.353 --> 44:52.220
Now, this is the business end.

44:52.256 --> 44:55.851
You should never point this
at anything you don't intend to kill.

44:57.227 --> 45:01.357
Now, this is important.
This is called your safety.

45:01.398 --> 45:05.334
You have to keep this on to make sure
the gun doesn't go off accidentally.

45:05.369 --> 45:10.329
But really, this is
your number one safety.

45:15.779 --> 45:17.644
Are you hungry?

45:55.419 --> 46:03.087
# I watched those youthful
paisley eyes #

46:03.127 --> 46:09.794
# They drink the screen
just like a child #

47:18.302 --> 47:20.702
Talk about shootin' your load.

47:27.177 --> 47:28.303
Look at this.

47:29.146 --> 47:31.307
This is a Hammerson Nite Tac.

47:31.348 --> 47:33.578
These aren't supposed to
hit the streets for 6 months.

47:35.819 --> 47:37.878
This is weird.

47:37.921 --> 47:39.855
All these guys have got 'em.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.386
Don't even tell me.

47:46.430 --> 47:48.990
Do you know how many of our men
he's body-bagged now?

47:49.032 --> 47:53.093
Why should I waste my beautiful mind
on something like that?

47:53.136 --> 47:54.967
Doesn't it piss you off a little?

47:55.005 --> 47:57.064
getting angry releases an enzyme...

47:57.107 --> 47:58.540
tryptophan hydroxylase...

47:58.575 --> 48:01.271
which can temporarily
reduce the I.Q.

48:01.311 --> 48:03.541
That's something I can't
afford to do right now.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.775
How do you know all that?

48:05.816 --> 48:07.909
My boy's hooked
on the Discovery Channel.

48:07.951 --> 48:10.442
Take me Westside.
I need to report in.

48:10.487 --> 48:12.978
I got a bead
on who our Mr. Hero is.

48:16.793 --> 48:18.021
No more arguments.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.086
I have to do this alone,
and the only way I can do it...

48:20.130 --> 48:22.257
is if I'm positive you two are OK.

48:24.301 --> 48:27.031
This is the only place
I know you'll be safe.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.062
- A tank?
- An M24 tank.

48:30.107 --> 48:32.473
You'll be safe from gunfire
and most explosives.

48:32.509 --> 48:35.307
- You're whacked.
- I am.

48:35.345 --> 48:36.972
I'm also serious.

48:37.014 --> 48:39.107
But nobody's allowed to get in it.

48:39.149 --> 48:42.414
Don't worry. When I create
a diversion, you climb inside.

48:43.720 --> 48:44.948
You should have
enough of that baby food...

48:44.988 --> 48:46.853
to last you a couple of days.

48:46.890 --> 48:49.381
The puréed carrots are the best.

48:50.527 --> 48:52.324
Well, you know
how to use this, right?

48:54.131 --> 48:56.292
Yes, but what if
you don't come back?

48:57.000 --> 48:58.695
That's not gonna happen.

48:58.735 --> 49:00.498
There is no way to be sure.

49:02.306 --> 49:03.830
Yes, there is.

49:18.755 --> 49:22.122
<i>Tu sei una stella, la mia stella.</i>

49:23.727 --> 49:26.787
- But, Mom, I wanna go home!
- Stop whining!

49:26.830 --> 49:29.321
If you don't behave,
I am going to spank you.

49:29.366 --> 49:31.926
- But, Mom, I wanna go home!
- Stop whining.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.231
Stop it!

49:33.270 --> 49:34.396
I hate it when parents...

49:34.438 --> 49:36.303
- hit their children.
- Let go of my arm!

49:36.340 --> 49:38.001
Not until you stop hittin' your kid.

49:38.041 --> 49:40.066
I will discipline
my child as I see fit.

49:40.110 --> 49:42.271
How would you like it
if I spanked you?

49:42.312 --> 49:43.301
What...?

49:44.181 --> 49:45.808
- See?
- Help!

49:45.849 --> 49:48.147
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

49:49.119 --> 49:50.313
Help!

49:50.354 --> 49:51.548
Help!

49:52.556 --> 49:54.922
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

49:57.861 --> 49:59.192
It's not funny.

50:14.511 --> 50:18.379
So, what you got on this
all-star ground pounder?

50:18.415 --> 50:21.111
Well, anybody this good
had to start out young.

50:21.151 --> 50:24.518
And it's usually because
their pop was good at it too.

50:24.554 --> 50:26.784
You know, like
MacArthur's dad was a general...

50:26.823 --> 50:28.848
and Mickey Mantle's father
played pro ball.

50:28.892 --> 50:30.382
My son is a video game whiz...

50:30.427 --> 50:32.861
and I wasn't too bad at
Pong myself.

50:33.764 --> 50:36.460
Just follow me,
if you will, Mr. Hammerson.

50:36.500 --> 50:40.493
In '67, the limeys
got hard-ass on gun control.

50:40.537 --> 50:44.234
So a lot of Brit gunsmiths
moved to the States.

50:44.274 --> 50:46.504
Now, I've got an inside man
at lmmigration...

50:46.543 --> 50:49.512
working on which of
these guys had sons...

50:49.546 --> 50:51.605
and if any of the boys
were crack shots.

50:51.648 --> 50:54.014
I think the pucker factor's
gettin' to you.

50:54.684 --> 50:56.208
You got diddly!

50:58.221 --> 51:01.987
Yes, Duchess, you a good girl. Sit.

51:02.025 --> 51:04.823
Yes. Now's your treat.
Now you get your treat.

51:04.861 --> 51:06.556
My man has been
running the name down...

51:06.596 --> 51:10.532
and he recalled one of these
gunsmith kids, actually.

51:11.935 --> 51:14.369
National sports pistol
champion at age 10...

51:14.404 --> 51:17.305
Olympic hopeful,
recruited by the army.

51:19.609 --> 51:20.598
- But after that, the kid is...
- Kisses, kisses, kisses.

51:20.644 --> 51:22.612
...never heard from again.

51:22.646 --> 51:25.513
Well, that sounds like Black Ops
got him, trained him.

51:25.549 --> 51:28.746
- This leads me to a theory.
- A theory?

51:28.785 --> 51:30.719
A theory is bull-noogies.

51:30.754 --> 51:34.451
All you got is a man with no name...

51:34.491 --> 51:37.289
ridin' into town on a pale horse...

51:37.327 --> 51:39.955
dispensin' his own brand o' justice.

52:11.328 --> 52:14.695
Hertz, you know why people
in this country love guns?

52:14.731 --> 52:16.858
And it's got nothin' to do
with all that...

52:16.900 --> 52:20.859
phallic mumbo jumbo,
like "cockin' your gun."

52:20.904 --> 52:23.134
No, Hertz, people love guns...

52:23.173 --> 52:27.200
because America
is a land of opportunity...

52:27.244 --> 52:29.872
where a poor man can become rich...

52:31.314 --> 52:34.340
...and a pussy can become
a tough guy...

52:34.384 --> 52:37.148
if he's got a gun in his hand.

52:39.689 --> 52:43.648
I'm hopin' you're not just
a pussy with a gun in your hand.

52:43.693 --> 52:46.856
Oh, no, sir, no. No, I'm not.

52:46.897 --> 52:49.627
I'm a tough guy with
a pussy in my hand.

52:54.738 --> 52:57.070
I want you to give this guy...

52:57.107 --> 53:00.076
and the kid a dirt nap.

53:00.110 --> 53:02.635
Yes, sir.

53:05.248 --> 53:06.840
Right away, sir.

53:09.252 --> 53:10.549
<i>Amore mio.</i>

53:12.222 --> 53:13.553
Don't worry.

53:13.590 --> 53:15.455
Daddy will be back soon.

53:33.910 --> 53:35.400
Hold it! Hold it!

53:39.216 --> 53:40.581
Well, well, well, Mr. Bunny.

53:40.617 --> 53:43.415
You just keep goin',
goin', goin', don't ya?

53:43.453 --> 53:46.513
- So do you.
- I promise to, uh...

53:46.556 --> 53:48.023
to spare your life
if you tell me where...

53:48.058 --> 53:49.491
the woman and child are.

53:49.526 --> 53:51.289
Forget it.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.537
Oh, boy.

54:04.574 --> 54:06.974
'Ey, who trained you?

54:07.010 --> 54:11.037
N.S.A. Black Ops? CIA?
The army?

54:11.081 --> 54:14.448
Well, whoever. It seems
you haven't lost your aim, champ.

54:14.784 --> 54:17.810
You think that's good, you should
see me spell my name in the snow.

54:21.324 --> 54:22.985
'Ey, you know, my boss here...

54:23.026 --> 54:26.553
thinks that you're the Lone Ranger
or something.

54:26.596 --> 54:30.088
Well, I believe I have a better idea
about who you are.

54:31.368 --> 54:34.735
I found out how your
wife and son were killed.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.069
My god, what a tragedy.

54:37.107 --> 54:39.507
Some guy walks into a burger joint...

54:39.542 --> 54:41.908
he starts shooting up the place.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.810
Oh, my god, what a shame...

54:43.847 --> 54:45.712
that your wife and son were there...

54:45.749 --> 54:49.241
having their... chicken nuggets.

54:55.425 --> 54:57.655
What's the matter,
ya don't like that story?

55:00.797 --> 55:02.924
Well, then why don't
ya tell me one, hm?

55:02.966 --> 55:05.332
Children's story, please.

55:05.368 --> 55:08.269
Oh, I know. Tell me my favorite, yeah.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.205
Tell me the one about the baby.

55:11.474 --> 55:13.339
Maybe later...

55:13.376 --> 55:14.843
when I put you to sleep.

55:19.249 --> 55:20.375
go, go!

56:30.553 --> 56:32.544
So, what do you think
of this second amendment now?

56:32.989 --> 56:34.081
Fuck you!

56:35.525 --> 56:38.119
OK, buddy, drop your weapon.

56:48.838 --> 56:50.601
Think we got him?

57:14.764 --> 57:18.165
god damn it, Smith!

57:18.301 --> 57:20.292
So I found out
who's tryin' to kill our baby.

57:20.336 --> 57:22.429
- Who?
- A man named Hammerson.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.735
Born with a silver spoon up his ass.

57:25.775 --> 57:27.743
Inherited the Hammer
Firearms Corporation...

57:27.777 --> 57:30.644
from his old man and
makes millions manufacturing weapons.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.773
Does this give you any new ideas...

57:32.816 --> 57:35.080
about who needs
Oliver's bone marrow?

57:35.118 --> 57:36.449
No.

57:37.220 --> 57:39.245
It's OK, little Oliver.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.621
Shit. It's him.

57:45.662 --> 57:48.460
Senator Rutledge.

57:48.498 --> 57:51.592
If he's elected president,
he'll put Hammerson out of business.

57:51.634 --> 57:53.693
It makes sense,
but how can you be sure?

57:53.736 --> 57:56.534
Mr. go-To guy called his men
a fine lot of babysitters.

57:56.573 --> 58:00.873
The secret service calls their agents
who guard VIPs babysitters.

58:00.910 --> 58:02.468
It's him, Senator Rutledge.

58:02.512 --> 58:04.070
He's the guy that needs this baby.

58:04.113 --> 58:07.048
So we contact this man
and then we're safe.

58:07.083 --> 58:08.846
- It's over.
- Are you crazy?

58:08.885 --> 58:10.182
This means that
we've got Hammerson...

58:10.220 --> 58:12.484
and the whole of the U.S.
government after us.

58:12.522 --> 58:14.149
I think you two have
gotta get out of town.

58:14.858 --> 58:16.655
Until I get the answers,
you'll never be safe.

58:16.693 --> 58:20.288
They'll be watchin' the trains,
the bus stations and the airports...

58:20.330 --> 58:22.798
So I think this is the safest
way to get out of town.

58:24.300 --> 58:26.325
I'm gonna check all of this out,
and if everything's OK...

58:26.369 --> 58:28.200
I'll get you
before you board the bus.

58:28.238 --> 58:31.639
But... What if you don't get
to us before we leave?

58:31.674 --> 58:33.471
Where should I get off?

58:34.577 --> 58:35.908
I think it's better if I don't know.

58:35.945 --> 58:37.378
- What?
- Trust me.

58:38.648 --> 58:40.377
I can't know.

58:47.090 --> 58:49.820
Smith, do you really think
this is gonna work?

58:49.859 --> 58:53.056
Just stick to the plan
and everything will be all right.

58:54.397 --> 58:56.058
Run!

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.909
So much for wearin' your seat belt.

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:52.004
What in the hell is that?

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:56.602
Oh, my god, that is twisted.

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.614
That sick son of a bitch.

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:02.508
Oh, that sick son of a bitch
suckered us again!

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.022
It's time to go, little boy.

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:16.796
Put me through to whoever's
protecting Senator Rutledge.

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.593
Just tell him there's a man
with a baby calling.

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.301
Hello, is this Smith?

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.936
That was a nice job coverin' up
your baby hatchery downtown.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:31.538
Not a word about it anywhere.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.947
Only you guys in Washington
have that kind of pull.

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:36.781
I'm telling you,
we're on the same side.

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:40.220
Now, listen, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:41.746
I wanna see the senator.

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:46.590
All right. He wants to see you too.

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:49.757
He's leaving for North Carolina.
The primary's in three days.

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:53.701
You can fly with him.
Runway 7, two hours.

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:58.105
I see anythin' I don't like,
I'm blowin' this big time.

01:03:11.654 --> 01:03:12.780
What were you doing in there?

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:18.523
- Cleaning my gun.
- Really?

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:21.955
You know, we were
never really trying to kill you.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:24.159
We only wanted to scare you
into surrendering.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.363
Well, that's one way to explain
why you can't shoot straight.

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:28.995
In the latest poll,
Senator Rutledge...

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:30.938
continues to be the
Democratic frontrunner...

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.168
heading into next week's
Super Tuesday primary.

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:35.643
He leads his rival by at least 10 points...

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:40.040
I owe you my life.

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:42.277
So this is where you get to do
all those hookers.

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:47.654
- I heard about you.
- You look worse than you do on TV.

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:51.786
Yes, it's amazing
what a little makeup can do.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.523
And a lot of morphine.

01:03:56.866 --> 01:04:00.393
So, you've pieced
the whole thing together.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:04.371
Very clever, Mr. Smith.
Very clever.

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:06.136
Simple.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.166
You're the Democratic
frontrunner for president...

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:10.475
and your sweeping
gun control proposals...

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.346
are pissing the wrong people off.

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:17.375
Yes, well, if they're pissed now,
wait until I'm elected president.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.853
We got so many goddamn...

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:20.048
gun lobbies out there...

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:22.887
that we're gonna have to set up
just as many commissions.

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:25.291
Then maybe we'll get our bill
passed in the first year.

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:27.888
Unfortunately, you're sick
and the gun Nazis found out.

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:31.730
They discovered your baby hatchery
and, boom, problem solved.

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:35.134
- They kill you by killin' the babies.
- Correct.

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:36.998
So, where's my savior?

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.133
Oh, my god! gun!

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:43.111
Easy, easy.

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:44.908
You know what I hate most?

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.346
- Liars.
- What the hell you doin'?

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:47.815
You made a deal with Hammerson.

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.010
- No, you're crazy.
- Am I?

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.416
- Y...
- When you got into bed with him...

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.284
you also let his dog up on the mattress.

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:53.788
Lookin' at those dog hairs
on your trousers...

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.791
I'd say old Duchess took a likin' to you.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.122
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:59.354
Save the line for when
you're in office, Rutledge.

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:00.726
If he ever makes it there.

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:02.390
Do you know what else I hate?

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:03.921
Hypocrites.

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.456
And you're the biggest one of all.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:07.560
Can you blame him
for sellin' out?

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.867
His operation to find the baby...

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.204
had been tits up from the get-go.

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.505
You see, Rutledge called us
and he offered us...

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:18.070
a proposition that we had
never dreamed was possible.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.143
In exchange for his life...

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:22.116
the senator promised
to protect our right...

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:23.880
To go deer hunting with an Uzi.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.548
Oh, come on, Smith. Come on.

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:28.147
guns don't kill people.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.657
But they sure help.

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:31.590
Back off!

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:32.992
Back off.

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.190
- Back off or I'll kill him!
- Oh, please.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:37.062
Pl... I had to do it.

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:39.659
I want to live.
I am meant to be president.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:42.637
Yeah? Well, you got what it takes.
You put yourself before the people.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:44.970
I can still do good in other areas.

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:46.406
How you gonna square it
with the public?

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:49.172
It is a constitutional right.

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.678
Back off! get back!

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.408
I've come around
to their way of thinking.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.678
Come around?
They had you at "hello."

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.817
Let me give you a piece of advice...

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:00.583
Never trust the people who stand
to profit, plain and simple.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:03.285
- They're the bad guys.
- Come on, Smith, don't be a fool.

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:05.886
go-to guy: the game is over.
You rolled the dice, you lost.

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.983
Let him go, Smith!
There's no escape!

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:39.995
Maybe not for me, but there
is for the woman and baby.

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:44.125
If I kill Rutledge, no one
will need to find them.

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.895
They'll be saved.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:49.928
Your assassination, Rutledge,
will create a public outrage...

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:52.839
and trigger immense support
for your proposals.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:56.333
The sympathy vote in the congress
will give your anti-gun bills...

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:59.542
passage by a landslide.

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:02.517
Your legacy... will live on.

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:03.984
Don't do it!

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.648
Then do it.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.487
Let me regain some honor
with my...

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:17.566
That son of a bitch.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.999
Son of a bitch!

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:25.369
god damn it!

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:32.004
# It's criminal #

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:34.812
# There ought to be a law #

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.816
# Criminal #

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:42.085
# There ought to be
a whole lot more #

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:44.058
# You get a nothin' for nothin' #

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:46.653
# Tell me, who can you trust? #

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:51.131
# We got what ya want #

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:54.796
# And you got the lust #

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.730
# If you want blood #

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:02.272
# You got it #

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:04.279
# If you want blood #

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:07.544
# You got it #

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:11.645
# Blood on the streets #

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:13.154
# Blood on the rocks #

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.986
# Blood in the gutter #

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.457
# Every last drop #

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.050
# You want blood #

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:21.956
# You got it #

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:27.493
# O positive #

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.812
# If you want blood #

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.075
# You got it #

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:35.194
Don't move, Mr. Hero.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.701
Can't talk right now, honey.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.403
I'm right in the middle of somethin'.

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:43.069
Bye-bye.

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:09.766
Don't you worry, Duchess.

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.966
This isn't gonna happen to you.

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:14.168
Not for a few years, anyway.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:17.572
Well, well,
well, well, well.

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:23.148
Somebody gets to be smart,
and somebody gets to be dumb.

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:27.349
Looks like you and I have
finally traded places, huh, sport?

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:30.548
Yes, indeed.

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:34.357
The circle of life.

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.523
The circle-a jerk of life.

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:39.625
Oh, you have
such a way with words.

01:10:39.668 --> 01:10:41.727
Now...

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:48.572
I want you to tell me...

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:51.409
where the woman
and the child are.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:54.041
Tell me, or I will be forced
to cause you...

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.880
considerable agony.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.250
Believe me...

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:01.882
nothing could be more painful than
listenin' to you jabberin' on and on.

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:09.157
Again, I ask...

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:10.859
where are the woman and child?

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:15.736
That's the last time
you'll be doin' that.

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:20.538
Just tell me what I wanna hear.

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.942
It's your choice
when the pain stops.

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.344
Why are you doin' this?

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.441
- It's over.
- It shortly will be, yeah.

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:32.820
No, I really should thank you.

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:36.985
I just got a bigger contract
because of you.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:40.325
I mean, I wasn't just on
Hammerson's payroll, you know.

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:43.058
What are you babbling
on about now?

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:46.033
Do you really think
the people that employ me...

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:48.502
were just gonna bend over
and take your little stunt...

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:49.799
killing the senator?

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:52.170
There's no way that you can
cover up this whole thing.

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:55.608
No? Haven't you heard
the news?

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.976
The senator's plane
crashed into the East River.

01:11:58.013 --> 01:12:00.743
They haven't been able to find
the body of Senator Rutledge.

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.876
So, you see, once I silence you
and the woman...

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.818
the cover-up will be complete.

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:07.151
So, once again, I ask you...

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:08.952
where are the woman and child?

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.925
You know how I'd break
your finger?

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.590
My boy told me this one.

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.823
You'd punch me in the nose.

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.353
I'd kick you in the ass.

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.398
Very amusing.

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:22.529
I give that one the ol' thumbs up!

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:26.707
What if you don't
get to us before we leave?

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.267
Oh, I know your whole story.

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:32.337
That man who went
on the shooting spree in the restaurant.

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:35.441
He visited the little gun shop
that you inherited from your dad.

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:36.712
I found out how your wife
and son were killed.

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:38.982
You sold him
the pair of shotguns...

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.010
Shotguns.

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:41.920
...that killed your own wife and boy.

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:45.089
I'm not telling you...
a goddamn thing.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.826
Where are you, Smith?

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.269
Well, well, well, well, well.

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:59.536
We're gonna need somethin'
a little more invasive.

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.257
That's it.

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:40.242
Aren't guns just fucking great,
Hammerson?

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:42.910
# Of excellent quality #

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:46.250
# I've dwelt there for years #

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:48.813
# Playing with my fears #

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:53.317
# It's tasteful, luxurious,
and full of sexuality #

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.731
# And though there are tears #

01:13:57.766 --> 01:14:00.496
# I control them with my gears #

01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:02.470
# Well, all in all #

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:04.768
# I must tell you #

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.775
# Well, I must tell you #

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:10.504
# I'm so #

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:12.343
# Proud of my private hell #

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.685
'Ey.

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:23.156
Who's a hotshot now, huh?

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:01.954
Oh, yes, sirree, Bob.

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.692
It certainly has been a pleasure.

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.597
But before we part ways...

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.465
tell me one thing.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.631
I am dead on...

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.799
about who you are, right?

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:14.308
Say that again?

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.208
I said, I am dead...

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.644
Stop.

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.806
That part of it you got right.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.006
It's the wife.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.286
Hi, honey.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.755
She's leaving me.

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.725
You know what I really hate?

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.614
What I really hate...

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:39.049
...is a pussy with a gun in his hand.

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:23.666
Investigators discovered
the body of Senator Rutledge today.

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:27.368
The FBI stated an anonymous
tip led them to the remains.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.001
Don't worry, little boy.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.973
Mama will be watching you
while she's working.

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:17.524
Oliver.

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.220
Hello.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.658
What took you so long?

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:48.946
All right, this is a robbery!

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:51.049
Empty the drawer, all of it.

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:52.458
Everyone else, freeze!

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.894
Do it or I'll fucking blow your head off!

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.557
He said freeze.

01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:58.691
That means don't even
pucker your butthole.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:01.032
That's right.
No puckering, nobody dies.

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:02.195
So don't fuckin' move.

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:04.228
We're kinda
in a rush here, man! Come on!

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:07.366
- You know what I hate?
- Shut up and sit on this, asshole.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.933
That's right! You heard him!

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.086
# Yeah #

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:57.114
# Kickstart my heart,
give it a start #

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:59.525
# Ooh, yeah #

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:02.394

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:04.864
# Ooh, yeah #

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.596
# Kickstart my heart,
hope it never stops #

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.230
# Ooh, yeah #

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:13.901
# Baby, yeah, yeah #

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:28.916
# Skydive naked
from an aeroplane #

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:31.357
# Or a lady with a body
from outer space #

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.588
# My heart, my heart #

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:36.495
# Kickstart my heart #

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:39.728
# Say I got trouble,
trouble in my eyes #

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:42.134
# I'm just looking
for another good time #

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.762
# My heart, my heart #

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:45.898
# Kickstart my heart #

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:50.772
# Yeah, are you ready, girls? #

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.905
# Yeah, are you ready now? #

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:55.746
# Ooh, yeah #

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:57.115
# Kickstart my heart #

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.483
# give it a start #

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.920
# Ooh, yeah #

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:03.550
# Baby #

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:06.425
# Ooh, yeah #

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:09.191
# Kickstart my heart,
hope it never stops #

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:13.497
# Ooh, yeah, baby #

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:27.781
# Ooh, yeah #

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:30.478
# Kickstart my heart,
hope it never stops #

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:33.214
# Ooh, yeah #

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:36.019
# Baby #

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:38.007
# Ooh,
