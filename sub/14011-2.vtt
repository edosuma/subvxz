We got it ¶

01:54.115 --> 01:55.714
¶ You hear a gun?
We shot it ¶

Let me through!

02:31.185 --> 02:34.686
(<i> overlapping screaming,</i>
<i> shouting</i> )

02:47.501 --> 02:50.769
Station 45, we have a shooting
in car number seven.

02:50.771 --> 02:55.174
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/Universal

04:20.761 --> 04:22.628
I heard there was two.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.863
One's still down there.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.699
They got two detectives
coming down right now.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.606
How are you doing,
fellas?

04:39.947 --> 04:42.681
Where are we
going, Joe?

04:42.683 --> 04:44.850
He's right over there.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.925
Looks like
we're in here.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.732
How's this one?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.334
He's okay.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.935
Guy doesn't look
so good to me.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.305
You're right,
He'd look better dead.

05:06.307 --> 05:09.875
One less jerk
with a screwdriver.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.943
You see the shooter?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.712
WOMAN:
I did.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.081
Could you describe him for me?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.382
Her.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.084
Her?

05:19.086 --> 05:21.086
What did she
look like?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.889
A ballerina.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.590
A ballerina.

05:25.592 --> 05:28.927
LOGAN:
Oh, yeah.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.996
Talk about your nutcracker, huh?

05:40.374 --> 05:42.774
You Jones?

05:42.776 --> 05:45.344
How are you feeling?

05:45.346 --> 05:47.112
I didn't do nothing.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.413
Of course you didn't,
Michael.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.715
You're a newborn babe.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.616
Well, then,
what do you want with me?

05:51.618 --> 05:52.951
Only your
speedy recovery

05:52.953 --> 05:55.654
so you might have a
happy and productive life.

05:55.656 --> 06:01.093
Actually...
we're on your side, Michael.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.061
Why did she shoot you?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.397
I don't know, man.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.399
The chick must be

06:07.401 --> 06:10.802
going crazy or
something.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.637
Well, what did
Darnell do, then?

06:12.639 --> 06:13.872
Nothing.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.140
Nothing?

06:15.142 --> 06:17.976
We heard he was coming on to her
pretty strong.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.078
Well, whoever told
you that is lying.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.782
My partner asked her
for some apple

06:23.784 --> 06:25.417
and she shot him.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.018
It's that simple.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.788
Asked? Or demanded?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.656
Asked.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.693
Besides, why did
she shoot me, huh?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.762
I didn't do a
damn thing to her.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.998
I was just sitting down
doing nothing, man.

06:41.969 --> 06:45.404
Listen, Michael,
now, listen real good.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.905
If the lady popped you two

06:46.907 --> 06:50.008
'cause you
were mau-mauing her

06:50.010 --> 06:52.677
and they put her on trial,
I'll testify for her,

06:52.679 --> 06:55.180
but if you're telling the truth,

06:55.181 --> 06:57.682
if you're telling the truth,
I'll haul her into that court

06:57.684 --> 07:00.419
and nail her
for attempted murder.

07:00.421 --> 07:03.755
I am telling the truth.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.492
And I got a real good
chance of proving it.

07:14.501 --> 07:15.534
Got a bleeder
here-- hemostat.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.935
MAN 2:
Here you go
Tie him off.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.437
Come on, come on,
get the lead out.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.738
MAN:
What's the hurry?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.206
This guy won't be running
a marathon.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.009
WOMAN:
Can you see all right?

07:24.011 --> 07:25.544
MAN:
Good.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.078
Yeah, let's wrap it up.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.015
(<i> knocking</i> )

07:33.020 --> 07:34.719
CRAGEN:
<i> You recover a slug?</i>

07:34.721 --> 07:37.722
Two: one in the subway,
one in Chenault's lower back.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.857
Well, that's a start.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.826
Any leads
on the gunman?

07:40.828 --> 07:41.960
Gunwoman.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.963
Gunperson.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.231
Lot of phone calls.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.966
Uh-huh. Who from?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.568
Bunch of psycho sisters

07:49.570 --> 07:52.070
each one claiming to
be the avenging angel.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.138
Oh, great, that is great.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.840
Who's calling her that?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.842
It's already
on the radio.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.543
Why do you think we're
getting all these volunteers?

07:58.545 --> 07:59.811
Maybe they can relate to her.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.112
Not to mention
they'd like to peddle

08:01.114 --> 08:02.781
their life story
to the highest bidder.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.249
I don't want the press
going into a feeding frenzy.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.486
You mean like,
"Babe to Punks: Drop Dead?"

08:07.488 --> 08:09.788
Maybe we
should deputize her.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.523
Just find her.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.294
WOMAN:
<i> I'm positive.</i>

08:15.295 --> 08:16.995
<i> He was grinding himself</i>
<i> right in that woman's face.</i>

08:16.997 --> 08:18.196
LOGAN:
<i> What about the other one?</i>

08:18.198 --> 08:20.131
He was just as bad,
but I kept my attention

08:20.133 --> 08:21.933
on the one
who was pushing on her.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.836
Are you willing to testify
in court to what you've told us?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.271
Of course.

08:26.273 --> 08:30.108
A lot of people develop short-
term memory loss these days.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.943
I'm not afraid
of punks like that.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.113
I've dealt with worse
when I taught fifth grade.

08:35.115 --> 08:39.217
Mrs. Hastings... the woman
who did the shooting,

08:39.219 --> 08:41.820
she's the one that
we're looking for.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.988
Well, you shouldn't be.

08:42.990 --> 08:47.058
When you find her,
I hope she gets a medal.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.296
"Midtown Dance Club."

08:51.298 --> 08:53.164
I think that's
what it was.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.900
Manhattan.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.201
You have good eyes.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.103
You've got to pay
attention. Chas?

08:58.105 --> 09:00.171
That's how come I
seen the ice pick.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.574
Ice pick? What ice pick?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.209
The one with the Yankees Cap.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.177
I'm a Mets fan;
I hate the Yankees,

09:06.179 --> 09:08.113
and he's waving an ice pick,
and I'm thinking,

09:08.115 --> 09:11.850
"What's this for? It's all
automatic ice cubes now."

09:11.852 --> 09:13.919
We heard it was a screwdriver.

09:13.921 --> 09:17.255
I seen what I seen.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.127
Look, you really think
we like these two dirt bags?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.112
So what's your problem?

09:24.113 --> 09:26.096
Shooting people you don't like
is a big problem.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.232
Unless you're
defending

09:27.234 --> 09:29.167
your own self.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.268
You saying it was self-defense?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.637
I seen what I seen.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.144
Why do I get
the feeling

09:39.146 --> 09:40.579
we're on the
wrong side here?

09:40.581 --> 09:42.280
Because you're thinking
like a civilian.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.582
Oh, yeah, right,

09:43.584 --> 09:45.150
I should have
known better, huh?

09:45.152 --> 09:48.920
Hey, don't worry, Max, next time
I'll be a good little German.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.855
You know, you've
got a wise mouth.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.908
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

09:52.909 --> 09:54.960
You want every fruitcake on
a BMT packing six on his hip?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.629
Of course I don't want that;
I just think that...
Don't think!

09:57.631 --> 10:00.165
The city ain't a free-fire zone.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.668
Give me a...

10:03.670 --> 10:09.341
Turn, turn, and port de bras.

10:09.343 --> 10:11.977
Okay, let's take five.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.379
Ms. Putterman?
Mm-hmm.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.648
I'm Detective Logan,
I called you before.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.284
Yes, I told you, it sounds
like Laura Di Biasi.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.385
You got her address?

10:20.387 --> 10:23.088
What do I look like,
a phone book?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.889
In Manhattan.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.192
Okay, everybody,
let's take it again.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.194
LOGAN:
Yes, I am aware, okay?!

10:29.196 --> 10:31.262
I'm aware it's unlisted.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.399
Now, I told you,
for the tenth time,
I'm a police officer.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.401
Let's get this straight.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.402
Detective Mike Logan,
Badge number nine...

10:38.405 --> 10:40.138
Warrant, huh?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.740
Warrant this,
lady, all right?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.042
I get a warrant,
it's going to take
me three hours.

10:44.044 --> 10:47.078
Now you listen to me!
You listen to me!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.947
Hold on.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.953
Hi. To whom
am I speaking, please?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.991
Hello, Miss Schweder.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.660
This is Sergeant Greevey.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.295
Could you connect me
with your central
office supervisor?

11:04.297 --> 11:08.033
Maybe we can straighten
some of this out.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.368
Thank<i> you</i> so much.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.937
GREEVEY:
<i> Chenault's got priors</i>
<i> up the ying-yang.</i>

11:12.939 --> 11:14.939
Nothing on Jones.
Nothing?

11:14.941 --> 11:16.174
Computer came up

11:16.176 --> 11:19.310
with 12 felons
named Michael Jones--

11:19.312 --> 11:23.381
Michael J., Michael Ray,
Michael T.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.016
I hate walk-ups.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.719
No positive make
on our own Michael,

11:27.721 --> 11:29.688
no middle initial Jones.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.389
Zippo.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.457
(<i> sighs</i> )

11:32.459 --> 11:34.959
Nobody home.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.328
Down the stairs.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.330
(<i> latch clicks</i> )

11:39.332 --> 11:42.801
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.338
(<i> clears throat</i> )

11:47.340 --> 11:49.007
Oh, excuse me.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.108
It's all right, ma'am.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.376
We're the police.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.478
Do you know where the lady
who lives there is?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.013
Miss Di Biasi?

11:55.015 --> 11:57.749
She works
at Murray Hill Hospital.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.284
MAN:
I'm the chief administrator
in this place,

11:59.286 --> 12:00.385
and I've told you twice...

12:00.387 --> 12:03.288
You don't discuss personnel.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.456
And I'm telling you,

12:04.458 --> 12:06.458
I'm not interested
in a discussion!

12:06.460 --> 12:10.028
I want to know
where she is.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.102
She's working in Radiology.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.171
Ms. Di Biasi?

12:20.173 --> 12:23.241
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

12:23.243 --> 12:27.312
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.181
Yeah. I imagine you would.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.752
I felt threatened.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.153
GREEVEY:
It's a threatening city.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.756
I felt I had to defend myself.

12:37.758 --> 12:38.890
Is that a crime?

12:38.892 --> 12:41.426
That's what we're trying
to determine.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.128
Why did you run?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.330
Because I was
freaked out.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.031
Okay, we can appreciate that.

12:47.033 --> 12:51.169
But... where did you get
the gun?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.104
Somebody gave it to me.
LOGAN:
Boyfriend?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.907
Somebody, I don't know,
it was years ago.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.976
Meaning it's probably
unlicensed.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.783
Okay, uh...

13:04.785 --> 13:06.050
what did you do with it?

13:06.052 --> 13:08.186
I guess I threw it.
Guess?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.788
I dropped it down there.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.855
In the subway?

13:10.857 --> 13:12.457
Yeah.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.159
STONE:
Listen, sure
you don't want

13:14.161 --> 13:16.027
to call your lawyer?

13:16.029 --> 13:18.446
<i> My</i> lawyer?

13:18.447 --> 13:20.864
Do I look like I could afford
to have a personal lawyer?

13:20.867 --> 13:22.467
Anyway, I don't need one.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.469
I haven't done anything wrong.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.538
I wouldn't count on that.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.014
Are you arresting me?

13:39.886 --> 13:43.555
Not at the present time,
but if we do arrest you,

13:43.557 --> 13:47.926
a lawyer will be provided
for you at no cost.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.001
Why are we
busting her chops?

13:57.003 --> 13:58.169
That the way
you see it?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.138
Hey, look, two kids
jump her on the subway,

14:00.140 --> 14:01.506
she defends herself, okay?

14:01.508 --> 14:04.042
We're not talking about
Squeaky Fromme here.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.211
We don't know that.
We don't?

14:06.213 --> 14:08.980
Look, she did the shooting;
that makes her the perp.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.049
That's all I know.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.518
What? you want to
<i> do</i> her or something?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.619
Hey, hey!

14:14.621 --> 14:16.020
It's all that
simple, huh?

14:16.022 --> 14:18.523
When it comes to the law,
it better be.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.024
Jones doesn't even
have a record.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.193
He says he was sitting down
when she shot him.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.997
Oh, yeah, he's such an
innocent-looking guy, Max.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.866
Ah, that's terrific.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.236
You're under arrest
for looking guilty.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.503
That's a cheap shot.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.872
The hell it is.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.473
That kind of thinking,
you can't do the job.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.142
When it comes to the law,
everybody's the same.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.245
That's when it works,
when everybody's the same.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.881
It's like football--

14:42.883 --> 14:45.083
You hold somebody,
you get caught, it's a penalty.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.284
Doesn't matter whether
you're Billy Sims

14:46.286 --> 14:48.653
or some rookie
for East Poduck State.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.994
GREEVEY:
<i> She admitted</i>
<i> that she did the shooting!</i>

14:55.996 --> 14:57.896
It's on videotape.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.532
She also says, "Yes, I wanted
to kill them to hurt them."

15:01.534 --> 15:02.850
Isn't that enough?

15:02.851 --> 15:04.167
You want to arrest her
on the Sullivan?

15:04.170 --> 15:06.104
The gun charge is pretty lame,
don't you think?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.907
It's still mandatory jail time.

15:08.909 --> 15:13.111
She fired into a crowded
subway car, for God's sakes.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.146
You want to go for attempted
murder, you're going to need

15:15.148 --> 15:17.615
a formal statement from
the other vic, uh, Mr. Shen-wah.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.052
That's Chenault.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.054
Darnell Chenault.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.255
Whatever.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.595
Chenault's been upgraded--
Room 322.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.532
Jones? Jones is in 324,
but you'd better hurry.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.869
Excuse me, ma'am.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.204
WOMAN (<i> over PA system</i> ):
Dr. Garcia, pick up
your messages in Receiving.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.539
Yeah.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.574
Dr. Garcia,
check your messages...

15:43.576 --> 15:45.310
Michael Jones?

15:45.312 --> 15:47.612
Used to be.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.614
DARNELL:
I don't want a shot, sweetheart.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.683
I want to get out
of this damn bed.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.252
NURSE:
Well, that's not going
to happen for a while, Darnell,

15:54.254 --> 15:55.586
so take it easy.

15:55.588 --> 15:56.955
DARNELL:
Take it easy?

15:56.957 --> 15:58.589
Hey, baby, give me
some decent drugs

15:58.591 --> 16:00.191
if you want me to take it easy.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.160
Nicely, Darnell,
nicely.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.562
What are you
so upset about?

16:04.564 --> 16:07.165
Man, they say
I'm going to be paralyzed, man.

16:07.167 --> 16:12.537
Dumb mothers give me
freaking aspirin with codeine.

16:12.539 --> 16:16.007
You the new specialist?

16:16.009 --> 16:17.709
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

16:17.711 --> 16:20.611
Yeah, Darnell,
just the facts, okay?

16:20.613 --> 16:22.680
The facts is--
why did the bitch shoot me?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.615
I didn't do nothing.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.551
STONE:
<i> Reckless endangerment?</i>

16:26.553 --> 16:28.653
That tells the jury
the girl was a little upset

16:28.655 --> 16:30.655
but so long as no innocent
bystanders were hit

16:30.657 --> 16:32.123
there's no problem.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.125
Well, there's something
to that, isn't there?

16:34.127 --> 16:36.361
I got a subway full
of eyewitnesses

16:36.363 --> 16:38.196
who claim they saw
one of the victims

16:38.198 --> 16:40.298
accost Miss Di Biasi,
threaten her.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.033
With his hand on his crotch?

16:42.035 --> 16:43.668
With a screwdriver!
Or with an ice pick

16:43.670 --> 16:44.769
or a pickax?

16:44.771 --> 16:46.304
It's funny what the eye
can witness.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.572
Attempted homicide.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.140
Look, I know we're
going to prosecute,

16:49.142 --> 16:51.142
but do we have
to hang her out to dry?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.777
Why? So every loop head
can blast away

16:52.779 --> 16:54.212
when someone asks her

16:54.213 --> 16:55.646
for the time?
Oh, yeah, right, I forgot.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.716
You guys in the DA's office
are a regular bunch of Karnaks.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.618
You ask me, the young gentlemen
were not asking

17:00.620 --> 17:02.420
for the time of day.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.225
Let us suppose,
just for the sake of argument,

17:07.227 --> 17:10.795
that Miss Di Biasi has had
a really horrendous day,

17:10.797 --> 17:14.032
and someone jokingly says,
"Stick 'em up."

17:14.034 --> 17:15.033
She kills him.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.135
It's not self-defense, right?

17:17.137 --> 17:19.437
So she's liable for negligent
homicide, only in this case...

17:19.439 --> 17:20.738
(<i> knocking</i> )

17:20.740 --> 17:23.374
In this case,
the guy didn't die.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.177
Okay, okay, so we go
for attempted murder then,

17:26.179 --> 17:28.713
if you're sure
you can make it stick.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.281
You'd better hope I can.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.717
She walks,
New York is Dodge City.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.751
May I make a suggestion?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.186
By all means.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.320
Skip the legal beagling,

17:36.322 --> 17:38.723
and go with plain vanilla
murder two.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.091
The coroner

17:40.093 --> 17:42.827
is determining the
C.O.D. on Mr. Jones

17:42.829 --> 17:45.063
even as we speak.

17:45.065 --> 17:48.332
Murder two?

17:48.334 --> 17:50.268
Bring her in.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.207
Wait a sec, huh?

18:06.119 --> 18:08.219
Ooh.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.255
(<i> phone rings</i> )

18:14.227 --> 18:16.160
Sergeant Greevey!

18:20.133 --> 18:22.133
Hold on.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.469
Look, relax, relax.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.774
Just tell me
what happened, honey.

18:38.251 --> 18:41.686
Well, why worry
about it then, huh?

18:41.688 --> 18:42.787
Yeah.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.256
Of course.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.226
We-We'll talk about it
later tonight, okay?

18:48.228 --> 18:52.296
I'll get home
as soon as I possibly can, okay?

18:52.298 --> 18:54.265
Yeah, me, too.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.138
What?

19:00.140 --> 19:03.808
It's nothing.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.410
Oh, I thought
it might have been something.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.848
Eileen got roughed up at school.

19:10.850 --> 19:11.883
Is she hurt?

19:11.885 --> 19:14.352
No, you know,
just some bruises.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.156
Is that all?

19:18.892 --> 19:21.726
Yeah. Yeah, that's all.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.432
Come on, let's wrap this up.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.434
Who did it?

19:30.436 --> 19:32.537
Three guys
from her basketball team.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.005
She ignored them,

19:34.006 --> 19:35.472
so they slammed her
up against the lockers.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.475
Bastards.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.544
I wonder if Chenault
and Jones were any good.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.846
At what?

19:41.848 --> 19:44.215
Basketball.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.854
(<i> hoarsely</i> ):
Don't touch me with that thing.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.857
GREEVEY:
Did you re-mirandize her?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.492
Yeah, on the way in.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.194
Where's my lawyer?

19:56.196 --> 19:58.229
Why isn't she here yet?

19:59.465 --> 20:02.400
Public defenders
have a heavy caseload.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.235
She told me she'd be here.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.204
Well, maybe she's
stuck in traffic.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.306
Have a seat.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.214
I really want a lawyer.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.217
I don't want to talk to you.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.819
You understand, Miss Di Biasi,

20:21.821 --> 20:25.923
that you are charged
with negligent homicide.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.526
And when you appear
before the judge,

20:28.528 --> 20:31.229
he'll determine
what the bail will be

20:31.231 --> 20:32.330
if the court decides

20:32.332 --> 20:33.497
that you're
eligible...

20:33.499 --> 20:35.333
Why is this woman
handcuffed?

20:35.335 --> 20:36.500
Sorry, there was
an accident on the FDR.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.836
You haven't said anything,
I trust?

20:38.838 --> 20:41.806
"Trust" and "lawyer" that's a
pair of words that don't match.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.841
How about "cop"
and "I.Q. over 90"?

20:43.843 --> 20:46.544
Shambala Green, I'm
Miss Di Biasi's P.D.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.845
So I gathered.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.247
And I ask again,

20:49.249 --> 20:51.649
why is she handcuffed?

20:51.651 --> 20:53.918
Because she's an accused killer.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.821
Look, Ms. Green, why don't you
save your attitude

20:56.823 --> 20:58.256
for the courtroom?

21:07.967 --> 21:09.834
Do you have a toothbrush?

21:09.836 --> 21:12.837
Because we have to take you
over to the women's side

21:12.839 --> 21:17.441
until you're arraigned.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.910
(<i> sobbing</i> )

21:27.687 --> 21:29.353
Here, Counselor.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.289
Do something useful.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.990
(<i> typing</i> )

21:38.531 --> 21:40.181
What nuance!

21:40.182 --> 21:41.832
I spelled it out for them
in black and white.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.868
Yep, and therein
lies the rub.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.003
What? The color angle?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.938
Forget it, Ed.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.174
And this isn't Selma.

21:50.175 --> 21:52.409
Neither was Howard Beach, and
you know what happened there.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.444
You read the<i> Times,</i> Paul.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.912
Blacks favor
tougher sentences

21:54.914 --> 21:56.414
for street crime
than whites do.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.983
Very good.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.551
We still got to worry
about the perception of racism.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.321
Did she think these
guys were a threat

22:03.323 --> 22:04.488
because they were
street toughs

22:04.490 --> 22:06.657
or because they were black?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.159
I can't answer that.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.660
All I know is that
self-defense requires

22:09.662 --> 22:12.663
that the response be in
direct proportion to the threat.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.965
The threat as she
reasonably perceives it.

22:14.967 --> 22:18.336
If she thinks
that she is about to be raped,

22:18.338 --> 22:20.671
can she kill her attacker?

22:20.673 --> 22:25.042
The law says yes, absolutely.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.911
And what if her perception
is wrong?

22:26.913 --> 22:28.446
If we let her go,
do you realize

22:28.448 --> 22:29.947
what we are unleashing
in this city?

22:29.949 --> 22:32.583
There's always
the weapons charge.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.386
You can't be serious.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.954
If we don't prosecute,

22:36.956 --> 22:38.122
we're creating
a city of vigilantes.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.457
A man is dead.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.425
I don't need a summation.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.427
Now, what do you want?

22:43.429 --> 22:44.929
Permission to file
a murder indictment?

22:44.931 --> 22:46.997
Want to ask
for deniability?

22:46.999 --> 22:48.466
I told you to file?

22:48.468 --> 22:50.368
Since when do I dictate to you?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.902
You don't have a problem?

22:51.904 --> 22:56.040
It's not my problem to have.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.259
ROBINETTE:
<i>No, ma'am, I'm not a policeman.</i>

22:58.260 --> 23:00.477
<i> I work for</i>
<i>the District Attorney's Office.</i>

23:00.480 --> 23:01.746
What do you
want to know?

23:01.748 --> 23:03.681
Is Miss Di Biasi
an RN?

23:03.683 --> 23:05.082
No, a technician.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.751
She used to be
a dancer.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.119
She told you that?

23:08.121 --> 23:10.571
We're friends,
she told me about it .

23:10.572 --> 23:13.022
She was performing with
a modern dance company.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.159
I don't know if she
made a living at it.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.627
But you do know
what happened?

23:16.629 --> 23:19.530
She was attacked
down in the subway

23:19.532 --> 23:22.066
by three,
youthful offenders.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.403
After she recovered,
she came to work here.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.638
And what was her reaction
to the attack?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.407
Same as anybody's.

23:29.409 --> 23:33.177
She was fearful,
resentful of all the little...

23:33.179 --> 23:36.013
Little what?

23:38.418 --> 23:40.584
Little black bastards?

23:42.955 --> 23:44.755
You see some black teenagers
on the train,

23:44.757 --> 23:46.724
are you automatically afraid
of them, Mrs. Maltese?

23:46.726 --> 23:50.661
Aren't you?

23:59.672 --> 24:03.474
Sometimes the
stereotype fits.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.143
Long as his story is true.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.678
Cops have shot kids
with screwdrivers before.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.813
Why not a 90-pound woman?

24:08.815 --> 24:10.181
How threatened
could she have been?

24:10.183 --> 24:11.682
She sat down right next to them.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.818
She's got a right
to sit where she wants.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.486
So do the other passengers,
but they moved away

24:15.488 --> 24:17.238
because it seemed prudent.

24:17.239 --> 24:18.989
Maybe she was tired
of getting moved around

24:18.991 --> 24:20.057
by the mugging class.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.091
The mugging class?

24:21.093 --> 24:23.694
What's that about?

24:23.696 --> 24:25.763
You're an assistant
district attorney.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.699
You work for the people.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.702
We follow
the letter of the law here.

24:31.704 --> 24:35.773
Go talk to Chenault.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.078
(<i> sports playing on TV</i> )

24:41.080 --> 24:45.249
My man tried...
scared her

24:45.251 --> 24:47.785
maybe with a screwdriver,

24:47.787 --> 24:50.588
but we was just
sitting there.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.223
Cut the crap, Darnell.

24:52.225 --> 24:54.592
You weren't sitting--
you were standing
up in her face.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.759
Everybody says so.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.529
I'm sitting here now, ain't I?

24:58.531 --> 25:01.265
I'm going to be sitting
for the rest of my life.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.133
So maybe you should
lighten up on the 'tude.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.503
Nobody likes a wiseass
in a wheelchair.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.205
Hey, whose side
are you on, anyway?

25:10.176 --> 25:12.776
Nobody's.

25:12.778 --> 25:14.612
I just want the truth.

25:14.614 --> 25:17.114
And I want a payback, man.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.283
Like I said, that's up to you.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.120
All right.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.223
All right,
we had the screwdrivers.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.826
We were going to rob some
lockers down at Grand Central,

25:28.828 --> 25:32.296
but we was never, ever
threatening to nobody,

25:32.298 --> 25:34.765
especially no white... chick.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.467
You unthreatening enough
so everybody

25:36.468 --> 25:38.168
was way down the other end
of the train?
Except her, man.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.804
She came in and sat down
right next to us.

25:40.806 --> 25:42.773
Now, why do you think
that was, huh?

25:45.645 --> 25:50.214
WOMAN:
<i> Even with a court order,</i>
<i> it'll take three working days.</i>

25:50.216 --> 25:51.782
I'm afraid
I can't wait.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.551
The wheels of justice
are turning.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.119
Don't you guys
have your own files?

25:55.121 --> 25:58.756
Hey, you're the paper of record.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.791
GREEN:
<i> And if this were</i>
<i> a Greek tragedy,</i>

26:00.793 --> 26:02.593
<i> I'd be guilty of hubris.</i>

26:02.595 --> 26:04.828
Public sentiment on my side,
witnesses on my side,

26:04.830 --> 26:06.330
precedent on self-defense

26:06.332 --> 26:08.832
going back to the days of
knights bashing each other

26:08.834 --> 26:10.801
over the head with them...

26:10.803 --> 26:12.269
those, um, now,
whatchamacallit,

26:12.271 --> 26:13.704
those fight
balls, those...
Maces?

26:13.706 --> 26:15.806
Maces. Thank you.

26:15.808 --> 26:16.941
See what I mean?

26:16.943 --> 26:18.642
Now, I am trying
not to gloat,

26:18.644 --> 26:21.345
but what have you
got on your side, Stone?

26:21.347 --> 26:24.815
Not very much, I agree.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.584
Only the New
York penal law.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.753
I don't think we have to discuss
the<i> Sullivan</i> statute.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.855
Concealed weapons
have been illegal for
the past 70 years.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.223
That code is also
pretty clear

26:33.225 --> 26:34.692
when it comes
to self-defense,

26:34.693 --> 26:36.160
and I'm afraid you
have not convinced me

26:36.162 --> 26:37.895
that your client acted in a way

26:37.897 --> 26:40.264
that was proportional
to an imminent attack.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.332
Oh, come on.

26:41.334 --> 26:42.967
The defendant must also
act in a way

26:42.969 --> 26:44.702
that is thwarting the attack,

26:44.704 --> 26:46.187
not inflicting grave injury
on the victim.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.671
Let's get it down
to single syllables, okay?

26:47.673 --> 26:49.607
The penal law
also clearly allows

26:49.609 --> 26:52.376
for the use of deadly force
to repel robbery, kidnapping,

26:52.378 --> 26:53.844
forcible sodomy,

26:53.846 --> 26:56.914
and/or forcible rape.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.282
I don't see anything
forcible about it;

26:58.284 --> 26:59.850
he was only asking.

26:59.852 --> 27:05.789
What kind of piggish attitude
is that, Counselor?

27:05.791 --> 27:08.859
Are you suggesting
that my client

27:08.861 --> 27:11.362
was asking for it?

27:11.364 --> 27:15.866
Miss Green, this is not
a personal attack,

27:15.868 --> 27:17.635
nor an attack upon the species.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.270
The fact is, there may have been
some degree of threat,

27:20.272 --> 27:23.007
but where that becomes
attempted rape is a fine line.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.743
Which all too many women of this
city have been pushed across

27:25.745 --> 27:27.244
while they've been wondering,

27:27.246 --> 27:28.846
"Is this really
happening to me?"

27:28.848 --> 27:30.681
The law is our
only defense

27:30.683 --> 27:33.417
against the rapists
<i> and</i> the shooters.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.853
People break it,
cops try to catch them,

27:35.855 --> 27:37.287
and I try to cook them--
it's my job.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.990
Sometimes I don't like it,
but it's all we got.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.826
Yeah.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.964
See you in court, Stone.

27:55.041 --> 27:59.410
Laura D-I-B,
as in boy, I-A.

27:59.412 --> 28:01.779
Uh...

28:01.781 --> 28:03.047
Letter to the editor?

28:03.049 --> 28:04.348
That's all you got?

28:04.350 --> 28:05.849
That's it.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.451
I owe you one.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.320
"The police seemed to
treat this vicious attack

28:10.322 --> 28:12.022
"as just one of
those things.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.858
"The authorities
don't want decent people

28:14.860 --> 28:17.394
"carrying weapons
to protect themselves.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.463
"We agree to give up
this right

28:19.465 --> 28:22.700
"on the assumption the police
will do the protecting for us.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.034
"Obviously, this is
no longer the case.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.336
Laura Di Biasi,
New York City."

28:26.338 --> 28:28.472
(<i> intercom buzzing</i> )

28:28.474 --> 28:30.274
The seeds of premeditation,
way to go.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.076
Yes?

28:32.077 --> 28:33.877
WOMAN:
Sergeant Greevey
and Detective Logan are here.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.012
Send them in.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.780
Get a search warrant
for her apartment.

28:36.782 --> 28:37.815
There may be other letters.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.818
Some people keep copies.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.386
Want to run through it?

28:42.388 --> 28:44.988
Sure.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.493
Now, Detective Greevey,
describe for the court

28:49.495 --> 28:52.496
if you will,
the accused's state of mind

28:52.498 --> 28:54.298
when you questioned her.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.399
She was upset.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.875
She said she intended
to blow their heads off,

29:04.877 --> 29:07.377
if necessary.

29:07.379 --> 29:10.881
Was that a question?

29:12.852 --> 29:16.286
Are we in the same room, Max?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.489
Look, we both know
what went down.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.958
She was scared half
out of her wits

29:20.960 --> 29:23.460
by those two perps.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.129
Victims, Max! Victims!

29:25.131 --> 29:26.830
What's going on?

29:26.832 --> 29:28.132
Meaning what?

29:28.134 --> 29:29.533
You were gung-ho
about this before.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.801
What's happened?

29:37.409 --> 29:40.010
Michael Jones,
the dead victim?

29:40.012 --> 29:42.012
the one the computer
boys said was so clean

29:42.014 --> 29:43.480
you could eat
off of him?

29:43.482 --> 29:44.782
Yeah?

29:44.784 --> 29:46.884
The coroner sent out
his fingerprints

29:46.886 --> 29:50.854
on a hunch, just to see what...
you know, for the hell of it.

29:50.856 --> 29:54.525
Turns out
his real name's Michael Mosket.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.894
Whoa, Mosquito Mosket?

29:56.896 --> 29:58.462
Yeah, ring a bell?

29:58.464 --> 30:00.330
Attempted murder,
negligent homicide.

30:00.332 --> 30:04.067
Two years at Spofford
when he was 14 for manslaughter.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.036
Real winner, this kid.

30:06.038 --> 30:09.039
This is really going to win us
points with the jury.
Yeah.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.508
They take one look
at him, they figure
the little bastard

30:11.510 --> 30:13.410
got just what he deserved.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.179
That's how you figure it, Max?

30:15.181 --> 30:17.181
Well, I remember Mosket;
that was all gang-related.

30:17.183 --> 30:18.816
There was no sex involved.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.818
Now, as far
as I read it,

30:20.820 --> 30:22.920
that girl was revenging
the earlier attack,

30:22.922 --> 30:25.522
and self-defense
does not allow for revenge!

30:25.524 --> 30:28.125
The law allowed Michael Mosket
to walk free.

30:28.127 --> 30:31.061
Until real justice
was served down in the subway?

30:31.063 --> 30:33.897
Do you have any other
personal views on this subject

30:33.899 --> 30:35.532
you'd like to air
before we walk into court

30:35.534 --> 30:39.169
and Ms. Shambala Green
hands us our asses on a platter?

30:39.171 --> 30:43.373
Nope, not a one.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.875
I don't believe this.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.844
The entire New York City
Police Department

30:46.846 --> 30:48.212
has lost its mind.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.547
Do you have anything to say?

30:50.549 --> 30:53.150
I go along
with what my partner says.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.885
Which is?

31:02.862 --> 31:05.629
The accused stated
that she intended

31:05.631 --> 31:11.602
to harm the victims, absolutely.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.945
STONE:
The defense will prove
that not only fear, but anger,

31:21.947 --> 31:24.081
stemming from
a previous incident

31:24.083 --> 31:26.283
lead Miss Di Biasi to an act

31:26.285 --> 31:28.886
not of self-defense,
but of vengeance.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.454
Armed with a deadly weapon,

31:30.456 --> 31:34.191
she waited
for the very next pretext.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.743
In essence, she went looking

31:35.744 --> 31:37.294
for Darnell Chenault
and Michael Jones,

31:37.296 --> 31:39.296
whose only offense
against the accused

31:39.298 --> 31:41.965
was that they appeared
to be threatening.

31:41.967 --> 31:44.968
If Miss Di Biasi
is so threatened by urban life,

31:44.970 --> 31:47.104
perhaps she could have avoided
the subway.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.906
Objection!
Objection, Your Honor.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.107
I trust
there'll be nothing further

31:50.109 --> 31:51.909
along that line, Counselor.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.311
GREEN:
Of course,
I'm more than willing

31:54.313 --> 31:56.113
to make a statement.

31:56.115 --> 32:00.017
The behavior of the prosecution
is totally inappropriate.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.969
I find it incredible

32:01.970 --> 32:03.920
that a city civil servant
of this city could suggest

32:03.923 --> 32:05.489
that a woman doesn't have
the right

32:05.491 --> 32:08.325
to ride the subway without fear.
REPORTER:
Mr. Stone...

32:08.327 --> 32:10.694
did you mean to say
that Laura Di Biasi

32:10.696 --> 32:13.096
has no right to live
in New York City?

32:13.098 --> 32:15.265
You're being a bit literal,
aren't you?

32:15.267 --> 32:16.784
I don't think so.

32:16.785 --> 32:18.302
I think your implication
was pretty clear.

32:18.304 --> 32:22.005
If a woman is afraid of rape,
she has no right to live here.

32:22.007 --> 32:24.975
Now, that's a curious position
to take for a prosecutor.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.332
Ballet books, poetry...

32:48.334 --> 32:53.036
a couple of how-to
books on achieving orgasm.

32:53.038 --> 32:57.007
Oh, great. Now, what?

32:57.009 --> 33:00.143
Did you find anything
incriminating?

33:00.145 --> 33:02.212
<i> Small arms manual,</i>
<i> Shoot to Kill,</i>

33:02.214 --> 33:04.047
<i> Hand-to-hand Combat. </i>
So?

33:04.049 --> 33:05.215
Unusual bedtime stories.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.250
That's my business!

33:07.252 --> 33:09.252
I assume you have a warrant?

33:09.254 --> 33:12.990
Save it.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.124
Excuse me.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.459
I'm sorry to bother you,
I really am.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.027
I know you're going
through a tough...

33:17.029 --> 33:19.262
(<i> laughs</i> )
Yeah, right, you know.

33:19.264 --> 33:22.132
I haven't slept
a full hour

33:22.134 --> 33:23.367
since this whole
thing started.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.335
Yeah.
Look, I should be going,

33:25.337 --> 33:28.338
and I'm sorry,
but I have to take these.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.340
It's not enough
you hang me,

33:30.342 --> 33:33.110
I have to buy you
the rope, too, huh?

33:36.348 --> 33:38.548
What have you got against me?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.217
I'm sorry?

33:40.219 --> 33:42.552
I don't understand
why you hate me.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.188
Look, I'm not free to dis...

33:46.525 --> 33:48.458
I don't. Of course, I don't.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.127
Then why are you...

33:50.128 --> 33:51.795
We really shouldn't be having
this conversation Miss Di Biasi.

33:51.797 --> 33:54.031
I wouldn't shoot you!

33:54.033 --> 33:56.099
Don't you understand?

33:57.236 --> 34:00.570
It all became unreal.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.039
It wasn't happening to me.

34:02.041 --> 34:05.108
All I could feel was fear.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.343
I was afraid of them.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.111
I was terrified!

34:08.113 --> 34:10.580
Not because
they were black,

34:10.582 --> 34:13.050
but because of who they were.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.318
I didn't mean to kill him.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.821
I couldn't
make it stop.

34:17.823 --> 34:20.490
They wouldn't... it wouldn't...

34:20.492 --> 34:22.259
Please, that's enough.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.361
What if you were on a train,

34:24.363 --> 34:27.464
and a bunch of rednecks
started hassling you?

34:28.567 --> 34:32.335
Wouldn't you be afraid?

34:34.273 --> 34:36.173
Wouldn't you?!

34:36.175 --> 34:37.374
Miss Di Biasi, please.

34:37.376 --> 34:42.079
I'm sorry, I can't comment.

34:44.450 --> 34:47.651
I can't stay.

34:49.588 --> 34:54.858
I came by to give you my
unconditional support, only...

34:54.860 --> 34:56.426
Number one, tone it down
a little.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.295
Number two,
try a little damage control.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.230
PR is not my job.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.431
You seen the papers?

35:01.433 --> 35:02.632
The DA, she was looking for it.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.234
They're having
a field day out there.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.569
I can't help that.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.354
Our whole strategy

35:07.355 --> 35:09.138
is sandbagging
the self-defense scenario.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.373
Even if she comes off

35:10.375 --> 35:12.275
as a revenge-seeker
with a hair-trigger?

35:12.277 --> 35:16.179
She pulled off five shots
in three seconds.
Excellent.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.581
But it would be
nice, real nice

35:17.583 --> 35:20.484
if we could have
a concrete piece
of evidence

35:20.486 --> 35:22.719
to support your revenge theory.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.122
D.A. Schiff, Paul.

35:27.392 --> 35:29.292
<i>Shoot to Kill?</i>

35:29.294 --> 35:31.328
Damage control.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.231
I found all this in her bedroom.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.534
Check the dates.

35:37.536 --> 35:40.570
The first one
was six months ago.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.141
She's improving.

35:52.184 --> 35:54.217
Wow.

35:54.219 --> 35:57.287
What were the extent
of those injuries?

35:57.289 --> 35:59.189
They were
fairly extensive.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.291
Could you describe them for me?

36:01.293 --> 36:03.226
They were tall, muscular.

36:03.228 --> 36:05.629
One had an afro with a goatee.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.497
No, no,
Miss Di Biasi,

36:07.499 --> 36:09.232
I'll rephrase.

36:09.234 --> 36:12.636
Could you please explain
and describe for the court

36:12.638 --> 36:14.504
the injuries?

36:14.506 --> 36:16.506
Oh.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.643
I had a shattered disc
in my back,

36:19.645 --> 36:21.645
some broken ribs,

36:21.647 --> 36:23.780
torn cartilage
in the right knee.

36:23.782 --> 36:27.184
And these injuries required
several operations didn't they?

36:27.186 --> 36:29.619
Yes, several.
Three?

36:29.621 --> 36:31.721
Five?

36:31.723 --> 36:33.523
Four, I think.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.392
Five.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.726
I don't know.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.296
They hurt me. Isn't that enough?

36:39.298 --> 36:41.598
Yes, of course.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.567
And no one blames you
for being resentful.

36:45.404 --> 36:48.305
These injuries finished you
as a dancer,

36:48.307 --> 36:51.541
didn't they?

36:51.543 --> 36:53.543
Yes.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.545
Does that seem fair to you?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.414
I object, Your Honor.
What's the relevancy?

36:57.416 --> 36:59.716
I'll allow it.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.687
No.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.555
No, it wasn't fair.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.424
I think it's
grossly unfair.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.392
I'm sure if I were
in your position,

37:09.394 --> 37:11.294
I'd carry
a nine-millimeter, too.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.296
Objection!
Withdrawn.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.365
Miss Di Biasi,

37:15.367 --> 37:19.402
in your dreams,
in your fantasies,

37:19.404 --> 37:21.438
did you ever wish

37:21.440 --> 37:24.541
you'd gotten back
at those youths?

37:24.543 --> 37:26.443
Objection! Objection!

37:26.445 --> 37:28.311
Your Honor,
this is unbelievable.

37:28.313 --> 37:30.430
She was defending herself

37:30.431 --> 37:32.548
against a man who's been
accused of multiple homicides.

37:32.551 --> 37:36.319
Mr. Mosket's priors have
no bearing on this case, Judge,

37:36.321 --> 37:38.421
nor of course, could she have
known about them.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.724
Overruled.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.726
Besides, he wasn't
the only threat, was he?

37:44.596 --> 37:47.330
Who else did you
find threatening

37:47.332 --> 37:49.499
Miss Di Biasi?

37:49.501 --> 37:51.668
Mr. Chenault?

37:57.442 --> 38:00.510
What exactly
did he say?

38:04.349 --> 38:06.783
He said...

38:06.785 --> 38:12.555
"How about a taste
for my friend?"

38:12.557 --> 38:16.726
Which<i> you</i> took
as an overture to rape?

38:16.728 --> 38:19.462
He was crowding me;
he was right up against me.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.464
Who, Mr. Chenault?
Mr. Mosket?

38:21.466 --> 38:22.832
Both of them?

38:22.834 --> 38:26.469
Yes. No. I don't know.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.471
At least one.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.539
And you tried to get away?

38:29.541 --> 38:30.774
Yes. Of course.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.375
The second time, too?

38:32.377 --> 38:34.010
Yes.

38:34.011 --> 38:35.644
That's why you shot him
the second time, to get away?

38:35.647 --> 38:36.913
Objection, Your Honor.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.448
Why did you shoot
Darnell Chenault

38:38.450 --> 38:39.649
a second time, Miss Di Biasi?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.451
I was petrified.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.386
I wanted to make sure.

38:43.388 --> 38:46.623
So you said,
"Here's your taste"?

39:07.813 --> 39:10.814
You said, "Here's your taste."

39:10.816 --> 39:12.816
Sounds rather cool.

39:12.818 --> 39:18.688
GREEN:
Objection, Your Honor.
STONE:
No further questions.

39:21.560 --> 39:26.629
Miss Di Biasi, you say
you didn't have time to think.

39:26.631 --> 39:29.899
Nor should anyone
be required to think

39:29.901 --> 39:32.936
when faced
with grave bodily harm.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.904
The human response

39:34.906 --> 39:37.574
is not to think,
but to react.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.709
Miss Green, get on with it.

39:39.711 --> 39:44.147
"Detached reflection
cannot be demanded

39:44.149 --> 39:48.585
in the presence
of an uplifted knife."

39:48.587 --> 39:51.421
Or screwdriver.

39:51.423 --> 39:52.589
Objection, Your Honor,
this has no bearing

39:52.591 --> 39:54.457
on why Miss Di Biasi
was waiting...

39:54.459 --> 39:55.759
This has all the bearing
in the world,

39:55.761 --> 39:57.927
a lot more bearing
than the Jesuitical casuistry

39:57.929 --> 39:59.763
offered by
the district attorney.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.633
May we approach the bench,
Your Honor?

40:03.635 --> 40:06.669
If you can be brief.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.908
Your Honor,
the speed of the events

40:11.910 --> 40:15.011
the time frame
of my client's reaction

40:15.013 --> 40:17.580
is crucial to my defense.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.015
I'd like permission

40:19.017 --> 40:21.484
to stage a demonstration
of the incident.

40:21.486 --> 40:22.719
If it please the court.

40:22.721 --> 40:23.920
Isn't this enough
of a circus, Your Honor?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.822
I'll decide that.

40:25.824 --> 40:30.427
All right,
but I warn you, Miss Green,

40:30.429 --> 40:32.896
I don't want to see
any undue theatrics.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.364
Thank you, Your Honor.

40:34.365 --> 40:35.831
JUDGE:
Ladies and gentlemen,
the court has agreed

40:35.834 --> 40:37.700
to allow the defense

40:37.702 --> 40:42.939
to stage a reenactment
of the occurrence in question.

40:46.011 --> 40:50.814
(<i> widespread murmuring</i> )

40:50.816 --> 40:52.916
Crimestoppers! Your Honor,
these people are on record

40:52.918 --> 40:54.584
as supporting the
vigilante tactics...

40:54.586 --> 40:55.652
If that's an objection,

40:55.654 --> 40:56.920
you're overruled.

40:56.922 --> 40:59.889
JUDGE:
Proceed, Miss Green.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.048
How about
a taste, baby?

41:25.050 --> 41:26.950
CHENAULT:
Oh, man.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.051
What the homeboys doing

41:28.053 --> 41:30.019
narcing for the
white folks?

41:30.021 --> 41:31.955
Order! Order!

41:31.957 --> 41:33.690
Huh! Come on, punks!

41:33.692 --> 41:35.625
Get over here! Come on!

41:35.627 --> 41:37.594
Bunch of queers!

41:37.596 --> 41:40.730
(<i> overlapping chatter</i> )

41:40.732 --> 41:42.832
JUDGE:
Order! Order!

41:42.834 --> 41:44.701
ROBINETTE:
If the Crimestoppers
didn't do it,

41:44.703 --> 41:45.835
Darnell sure as hell did.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.637
How much worse can it get?

41:47.639 --> 41:49.973
Not much-- I want you up there
for the rest of the day.

41:49.975 --> 41:51.841
What, an antidote
to brother Darnell?

41:51.843 --> 41:53.676
The name on
everyone's lips.

41:53.678 --> 41:54.978
I got a woman
down the hall

41:54.980 --> 41:58.515
who can't stop
talking about him.

41:58.517 --> 42:01.818
I'll sign a complaint,
point the finger,

42:01.820 --> 42:04.237
you name it.

42:04.238 --> 42:06.655
You recognized Mr. Chenault how,
from seeing him on the news?

42:06.658 --> 42:07.991
Mm-hmm, that's right.

42:07.993 --> 42:11.661
And, uh, the other one...
the one that died.

42:11.663 --> 42:12.896
Mosquito Mosket.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.731
Mm-hmm.

42:14.733 --> 42:17.634
Yeah. Too bad.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.636
I mean, he's...

42:19.638 --> 42:21.971
he's the one
that tried to rape me.

42:21.973 --> 42:23.773
That I'm sure of.

42:23.775 --> 42:25.575
And I'm pretty sure

42:25.577 --> 42:28.044
the guy in the wheelchair
held me down.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.079
How sure is pretty
sure, Miss Diamond?

42:30.081 --> 42:35.818
Like I said, I'm positive
of the one that died.

42:46.865 --> 42:48.097
Adam, I need to
twist Darnell.

42:48.099 --> 42:50.066
I need your permission.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.635
Yeah, what are you
talking about?

42:52.637 --> 42:54.771
Well, there's a woman
right now with Stevenson,

42:54.773 --> 42:56.072
swearing out a complaint
about Chenault.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.607
What's that got to do
with anything?

42:57.609 --> 42:59.092
Well, maybe nothing,
maybe everything,

42:59.093 --> 43:00.576
but if those two are rape-
happy, I want to know that

43:00.579 --> 43:02.645
before I go tearing
into Laura Di Biasi again.

43:02.647 --> 43:05.014
Can't anyone around here

43:05.016 --> 43:06.983
stay on the same side
of the street for ten seconds?

43:06.985 --> 43:08.051
Well?

43:08.053 --> 43:10.787
If we change our tune now,

43:10.789 --> 43:12.789
we're facing
a public relations disaster.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.790
I know that, you don't
have to tell me that.

43:14.793 --> 43:16.226
I know that.

43:16.227 --> 43:17.660
But if I don't listen
to my reasonable doubt...

43:17.662 --> 43:19.662
I thought Mosket was
a gang member, violent,

43:19.664 --> 43:20.830
but no history
of sexual crimes.

43:20.832 --> 43:22.348
But with what
I know now,

43:22.349 --> 43:23.865
the defendant's perceptions
may be accurate.

43:23.868 --> 43:25.668
I can't prosecute
on that level.

43:25.670 --> 43:27.670
All right, fine, but
we've got to consider...

43:27.672 --> 43:29.205
I won't do it.

43:29.207 --> 43:31.774
What the hell.
Go for it.

43:31.776 --> 43:34.177
I'll ask Leon
for a continuance.

43:34.179 --> 43:35.979
Damn, cuz, slow down!

43:35.981 --> 43:40.083
What do you want, man?
The truth.

43:40.085 --> 43:42.685
Look, I was
sitting down, man

43:42.687 --> 43:45.088
just like I'm
sitting down now.

43:45.090 --> 43:47.390
I didn't even
move a muscle.

43:47.392 --> 43:48.825
Damn, man,
Mosquito's the one

43:48.827 --> 43:53.162
who's into biting
on white chicks.

43:53.164 --> 43:58.768
JUDGE:
<i> This is rather unbelievable,</i>
<i> Mr. Stone.</i>

43:58.770 --> 44:01.137
The defense has an obligation
to defend its client

44:01.139 --> 44:04.107
vigorously, even if it does know
the client is guilty.

44:04.109 --> 44:05.975
The prosecutor's job
is much more restrictive.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.077
I have to drop the charges

44:08.079 --> 44:09.946
if I believe
the accused is innocent,

44:09.948 --> 44:13.249
and with the new information
on Mosket, I have no choice.

44:13.251 --> 44:14.884
There is reasonable doubt
on murder two.

44:14.886 --> 44:17.120
So what are
you looking for?

44:17.122 --> 44:19.222
That she pleads
on the gun charge

44:19.224 --> 44:21.224
and the reckless endangerment.

44:21.226 --> 44:23.793
Chenault was shot
sitting down

44:23.795 --> 44:25.895
according to an eyewitness.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.897
Miss Green?

44:27.899 --> 44:29.932
Forget it, Judge.

44:29.934 --> 44:32.068
Mr. Stone is hardly
in a position to negotiate.

44:32.070 --> 44:33.870
Why don't we just
go back in there,

44:33.872 --> 44:36.139
tell the jury
the truth about Mosket,

44:36.141 --> 44:38.841
and let them decide how
to deal with my client?

44:38.843 --> 44:42.912
You are a public defender.

44:42.914 --> 44:44.947
Try defending the public.

44:44.949 --> 44:47.016
If this goes to a jury,

44:47.018 --> 44:49.052
they won't convict
on a gun charge.

44:49.054 --> 44:51.020
She's innocent.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.256
Miss Laura Di Biasi
is not innocent

44:53.258 --> 44:56.793
of carrying and discharging
a lethal weapon

44:56.795 --> 44:59.028
in a closed and
crowded subway car.

44:59.030 --> 45:02.298
And if we acquit her
on this,

45:02.300 --> 45:03.900
we will be inviting
nine million people

45:03.902 --> 45:06.002
to arm themselves.

45:06.004 --> 45:07.737
This is not a question
of win or lose.

45:07.739 --> 45:09.706
It's a question of justice.

45:11.810 --> 45:14.243
We're both paid by the people.

45:14.245 --> 45:17.046
We're both part of the system.

45:17.048 --> 45:20.950
Let's let it work
the way it's supposed to.

45:22.921 --> 45:27.724
Are you flexible on sentencing
for the Sullivan violation?

45:27.726 --> 45:30.860
One year suspended,
three years probation

45:30.862 --> 45:33.229
2,000 hours of community service

45:33.231 --> 45:35.965
on the Sullivan.

45:35.967 --> 45:39.302
Five years suspended
on the reckless endangerment.

45:39.304 --> 45:42.238
Plus, she must submit
to a psyche profile test

45:42.240 --> 45:44.207
and whatever care mandated
by the hospital

45:44.209 --> 45:45.308
during probation.

45:45.310 --> 45:48.277
Deal?

45:53.218 --> 45:54.817
Naturally, my client
is gratified

45:54.819 --> 45:57.787
that justice has been served.

45:57.789 --> 45:59.789
We also look upon this

45:59.791 --> 46:02.325
not only as a personal
vindication but also a victory

46:02.327 --> 46:03.960
for every woman
and man that rides the subways

46:03.962 --> 46:06.529
or walks the streets
of New York.

46:06.531 --> 46:09.165
And I want to thank
the district attorneys

46:09.167 --> 46:12.135
for having the courage
of their convictions.

46:12.137 --> 46:13.936
It's not a perfect world,

46:13.938 --> 46:15.238
but at least
we can walk away

46:15.240 --> 46:17.039
from this one feeling we
did the right thing.

46:17.041 --> 46:19.942
Really? It feels to me
like all we did

46:19.944 --> 46:19.975
was make a wrong
seem like a right.
