00:54.388 --> 00:56.527
What's he doing in there?

00:56.690 --> 00:58.135
I thought he was right behind us?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.238
He's getting something
for the bar owner.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.271
He's getting
something for the bar owner?

01:09.536 --> 01:10.776
I think I see him.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.219
Whoa!

01:16.276 --> 01:17.914
Mission accomplished.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.384
- Here you go, sir.
- No no no.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.727
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.730
That's an expensive case of Scotch.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.631
- Merry Christmas, guys.
- Merry Christmas to you.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.863
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks, man, thanks.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.473
So what do you guys say?
Happy hour my place 6:00 a.m.?

01:36.630 --> 01:38.803
- Whool
- Let's go!

01:38.966 --> 01:40.274
Yeah. Thanks.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.141
Let's do this.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.145
I'm gonna throw this up front.

01:53.580 --> 01:54.923
I'm sorry your night got mined.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.062
Hopefully this makes
you feel a little better.

02:09.363 --> 02:12.173
She was cute!
Look at you.

02:12.332 --> 02:15.006
Jeremy Coleman-
one-man community outreach program.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.079
Don't say it!
Okay, I don't want to hear it.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.844
Let's just try and give this
one more than a couple weeks.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.613
Just because you've been domesticated
doesn't mean I want to be domesticated.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.949
I need you to get domesticated.
We need another couple to hang out with.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.558
Ooh, another exciting night
of Pictionary? No thank you, I'm good.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.024
Pictionary, Charades,
some fuckin' Boggle--

02:30.183 --> 02:32.686
Yourjabbering is delaying
my drinking. Let's get mobile.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.457
I'm right behind you.
Let's do this.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.692
We gotta stop by the store,
get provisions.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.928
Hey, what are you
doing for Christmas?

02:39.092 --> 02:41.003
What do I do every Christmas?
I'm picking up a shift.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.539
We're having dinner with Maria's family.
You're invited.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.199
- She insists.
- Thank you, really,

02:45.365 --> 02:46.639
but I like working the holidays.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.870
- Let's go.
- Of course.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.382
Weeest, y'all can
accept it or not

02:53.540 --> 02:55.520
Fools thinkin' Dub S
left wit 'Pac

02:55.676 --> 02:58.486
Weeest, still in tha 4s
and the 'lacs--

03:00.213 --> 03:01.886
Hey hey hey.
Grab me some--

03:02.049 --> 03:05.587
Stop! Before you ask for whatever shit
you're about to ask for,

03:05.786 --> 03:08.892
- remember, 15-year-old Scotch.
- That means it's good, Craig.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.696
I understand now, fellows.
Thank you.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.701
- Grab me a double bag of Funyuns.
- Fuck.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.271
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.909
If I'm not mistaken, we're about
to drink this upscale booze

03:18.065 --> 03:20.875
in plastic cups in your shitty apartment
at 7:00 in the morning,

03:21.034 --> 03:23.071
so ease up off the sommelier shit

03:23.236 --> 03:26.046
- and grab me some fucking Funyuns!
- You're disgusting.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.581
Hey, we'll be across
the street getting gas. All right?

03:29.743 --> 03:31.245
And some black licorice, Jeremy!

03:31.411 --> 03:34.085
I like my licorice
like I like my women.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.920
Don't discriminate, Jeremy!

03:36.917 --> 03:39.523
- Yo, Jeremy! What's up, man?
- Morning, fellas!

03:39.686 --> 03:42.098
You don't have to straighten up for me,
Calvin, that's all right.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.565
You know I'm playing in that
holiday tournament tomorrow night.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.864
- You better show up this time.
- I'll be there, hey, I'll be there.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.405
I promise.
Hey, Pringles 3-pointer-- hit me.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.741
- Whool
- Look at that kid.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.277
And that's why
the college scouts keep calling.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.108
It's looking like a full ride now.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.874
Hell, they might even take me.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.780
Yeah right, Dad.
Keep dreaming.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.943
So you've been out
rescuing cats from trees?

04:03.110 --> 04:05.454
Yeah, something like that.
Hey, when are you gonnajoin up?

04:05.612 --> 04:08.024
Yeah right,
maybe the Second Coming.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.218
How you doing, fellas?

04:15.322 --> 04:17.029
La-di-da.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.795
Help you with something?

04:25.465 --> 04:28.105
Keep your nose
on the floor, you fucker!

04:28.268 --> 04:29.906
Settle down.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.311
- Now!
Okay okay.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.252
Don't you do nothin'.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.985
Okay.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.597
Why don't you come out
from around the counter?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.099
Get on your knees right here!

04:57.164 --> 04:58.837
Get your nose on the fuckin' ground.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.342
Get on your knees!

05:00.500 --> 05:01.843
Kneel down.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.186
Now my man that came
in here last week,

05:12.612 --> 05:14.853
he told you I wanted your store.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.787
Now you told him that

05:17.951 --> 05:20.022
you weren't gonna give up the lease.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.189
I told him I was sorry

05:22.355 --> 05:24.266
but this is a good location for us.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.871
Yeah, I know it's a good location.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.341
- It's got freeways.
- Yeah.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.500
Easy to move packages in and out.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.112
I know it.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.475
This whole neighborhood

05:37.637 --> 05:39.344
belongs to the Eastside Crips.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.679
Eastside Crips.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.880
Look, I have to pay them
every month.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.651
I'm under their protection.

05:47.814 --> 05:50.021
So it's no disrespect to you,

05:50.183 --> 05:52.891
but that's the reason
you can't do business here.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.055
If you want me to,
I can call them for you.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.202
I mean you can talk
to 'em for yourself.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.961
Look, I'll get my phone.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.399
HQY1 Pllf your chin up!

06:00.560 --> 06:01.868
I was just gettin' my phone.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.565
I mean if you want to,
you can talk to 'em.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.201
I'd like that, yeah.
Yeah, get your phone.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.879
Don't fucking tempt me!
I want to!

06:13.073 --> 06:14.882
Here.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.546
Hey, what's up, cuz?

06:18.712 --> 06:21.090
My name is David Hagan.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.888
I don't care much what yours is.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.792
Listen, you gonna go up
against me, I'll kill you.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.764
I'll kill you and everyone close to you.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.929
- Jesus!
- Calvin!

06:34.094 --> 06:36.802
- No.
- Yeah yeah!

06:36.997 --> 06:39.273
- Oh Jesus, oh Jesus Christ.
- Shut the fuck up.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.537
- Tell him I shot your son.
What did you kill him for?

06:41.701 --> 06:44.079
Come on, Dennis.
Tell him I shot your son.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.773
- Come on, Dennis.
- Oh my God.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.215
Tell him to prove a point
lshot your son.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.821
It'll mean more if you do it.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.625
- Shit.
- Come on, baby, come on.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.729
- Come on, come on.
- Nah.

06:58.885 --> 07:02.230
- No, Dennis!
- Now we're talking.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.470
Hi, I'm back.

07:06.626 --> 07:08.128
Listen, if I want your territory,

07:08.295 --> 07:10.639
I'll take your territory.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.505
It's been nice talking to you.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.080
What about him?

07:17.237 --> 07:20.150
I don't know, genius.
Figure it out.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.060
Fuck.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.470
Oh God damn it!

08:18.698 --> 08:20.006
- Jeremy!
- Jeremy!

08:20.166 --> 08:21.201
Jeremy!

08:21.368 --> 08:22.870
- Oh shit.
- What is it, man?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.709
- Jeremy.
- Call 911.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.148
- Jeremy, are you all right?
- Call 911. They shot Calvin.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.049
- Who?
- They shot Dennis.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.689
Who who who?
Who shot Dennis?

08:40.720 --> 08:43.291
Mike? Mike?

08:43.456 --> 08:45.561
You're gonna want to see this.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.537
- What's the charge?
- Murder in the first.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.903
- Who caught the case?
- Paxson.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.840
I know-- there was
no evidence at the scene,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.843
but there was an eyewitness,
and he's solid--

08:56.002 --> 08:57.572
he was like three feet
away from Hagan.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.410
Please tell me
they didn't fuck this up.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.176
It's a slam dunk even for him.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.184
- It's done.
- Tell Paxson I'm taking over the case.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.880
- When are they making the arrest?
- He's already in the box.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.980
David Hagan, line up.
Let's go.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.832
Lieutenant.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.470
How are you doing, Mike?

09:58.631 --> 10:00.269
Great.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.007
Lieutenant.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.654
Jeremy, hey.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.490
I'm Detective Mike Celia,
District Attorney Sharon Westlake.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.757
Harold Gethers,
criminal attorney.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.694
When you see the man
you saw at the store,

10:26.860 --> 10:28.498
say his number
and he'll step forward

10:28.661 --> 10:29.662
and repeat one
of the phrases you heard.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.137
What he claims to have heard.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.450
It's number four.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.020
Number four, step forward
and repeat the phrase.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.491
Number four,
please step forward.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.460
Yeah.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.477
Jeremy Thomas Coleman.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.876
- Oh my God.
- Social security number:

11:10.036 --> 11:13.882
434-60-5119.
He lives at-

11:14.040 --> 11:17.544
Okay, for the record
I knew nothing about that.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.213
And what he just said does not
constitute an actual threat.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.382
- Your client just read--
- I believe my client

11:22.549 --> 11:24.153
has not been formally identified.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.495
That's him.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.730
We have a responsibility
to our witness

11:34.894 --> 11:36.771
- and I don't mean procedurally.
- Obviously.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.568
I mean emotionally, morally.

11:40.099 --> 11:42.773
- He ID-'d Hagan.
Jeremy needs to know

11:42.936 --> 11:45.883
who he's testifying against
and he needs to know your end of it.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.781
I'm telling you we're gonna have
to play good cop, bad cop here.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.683
All right, tell me about him.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.687
Local, born and bred; parents died
in a fire when he was eight;

11:53.846 --> 11:55.917
couple of group homes,
some juvie stuff;

11:56.082 --> 11:58.255
entered the fire academy,
only job he's ever had.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.193
- No other family?
- Hm-mmm.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.128
Good.
Makes it easier for us.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.598
See you in a minute.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.399
Hello, Jeremy,
thanks for waiting.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.576
Before Detective Cella
gets here,

12:14.734 --> 12:17.578
I'd like to give you some
background information, okay?

12:18.605 --> 12:20.084
Okay.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.084
Okay.
A few years ago,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.689
after David Hagan tumed
his Aryan following

12:25.812 --> 12:27.689
in San Quentin into a street crew,

12:27.814 --> 12:29.816
Detective Cella
and his partner decided

12:29.983 --> 12:32.293
to go after his organization.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.898
They made cases against
some of these guys.

12:36.222 --> 12:39.260
They wanted them to flip,
to testify for the state.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.998
That didn't work out.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.267
Hagan killed
Detective Celia's partner

12:45.431 --> 12:47.843
and his partner's wife.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.147
You gonna tell him
how the DA's office

12:53.306 --> 12:55.616
- gave up on the case?
- Stop.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.812
That had nothing to do
with this case.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.287
Yeah, and neither does
a half a dozen or so crimes

13:00.446 --> 13:02.016
on Hagan's rap sheet.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.957
- Tell him the truth!
- The truth is...

13:06.486 --> 13:09.558
we can't get Hagan
unless you testify.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.134
The truth is
Hagan is a sociopath.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.863
He is a stone-cold killer.
He doesn't give a fuck.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.269
I will put you
in witness protection.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.205
The feds will keep you safe.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.007
So my whole life just--

13:23.169 --> 13:25.308
just goes away?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.849
You get to keep your first name.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.786
You-- you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

13:32.945 --> 13:36.154
Fucking witness protection.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.875
All right.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.683
I'll do it.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.445
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.080
I'll do it.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.554
Your driver's license,
Mr. Coleman.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.991
Put your bag
on the side please.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.064
Step on through.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.126
Thank you.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.868
You're late.
Come on.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.537
Right through here.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.244
Hey, Mullen.
Mullen, they're here.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.477
Go ahead and patch it in.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.053
Come on in and sit down.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.828
- This is Mike Cella.
- Hey, Lieutenant.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.554
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.427
The judge moved the case up.
We go to trial in two weeks.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.568
Oh! Thank God!

17:06.358 --> 17:08.339
I gotta tell you, man,
I am so ready to go home.

17:08.493 --> 17:11.065
I'll be the first to buy
you a beer-- the first of many.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.006
And listen, thank you.
Really thank you, man.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.976
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- Okay.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.519
Congratulations, son.
That's it.

17:21.674 --> 17:22.709
Thank you so much.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.218
Thank you very much.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.721
- Mmm.
- Yes!

17:33.085 --> 17:34.120
Thank you.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.874
Taxi taxi!

17:56.676 --> 17:58.622
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

18:02.048 --> 18:03.618
We're US Marshals, not amateurs.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.229
I know you've been sneaking out
of the apartment we got you

18:06.385 --> 18:08.331
- and coming to this motel.
- I've been--

18:08.487 --> 18:09.898
I've been seeing someone.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.626
What, you couldn't wait
till you got back home

18:11.791 --> 18:13.498
to start hooking up
with random girls?

18:13.693 --> 18:15.866
It-- it's not like that, okay?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.405
Oh.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.702
Is she special?

18:20.733 --> 18:21.939
Yeah.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.707
Very.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.422
Now I'm curious.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.456
So tell me about her.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.487
I said tell me about her!

18:42.488 --> 18:44.195
She's kind of a smartass.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.928
So far I like her
- Yeah?

18:47.927 --> 18:50.066
She likes to run her mouth a lot.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.340
She's beautiful.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.817
She forgets that sometimes.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.509
Mm-hmm.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.313
And when this
whole thing is over,

19:04.477 --> 19:06.514
she's coming back
to Long Beach with me.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.182
She's thinking about it.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.663
It wouldn't be dating
in secret anymore.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.094
You'd finally get to meet
all my idiot friends.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.766
It'd be like a real couple.

19:17.923 --> 19:21.166
Maybe you feel a certain way
about this girl right now,

19:21.327 --> 19:23.568
then when you get back home--

19:23.763 --> 19:26.175
Nah. I know how
I feel about her.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.475
Yeah?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.710
Prove it.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.011
Hiya.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.846
Good evening.
Do you have a reservation?

20:09.008 --> 20:11.716
All I have are crossed fingers.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.357
Well, I'll see what I can do for you.

20:14.513 --> 20:17.585
Good golly, you got some
pretty looking nails there, girl.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.856
Thank you. Some people say
they match my eyes.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.158
That they do.

20:23.522 --> 20:26.264
Well, it looks like you're in luck.
We have vacancies.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.768
It will run you $89,

20:27.927 --> 20:29.634
- which includes tax.
- It includes tax?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.433
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.043
- Will it just be you by yourself?
- Actually me and my buddy.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.645
- Okay.
- One room, two beds.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.712
Non-smoking,
a couple of nights.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.922
All right, farther back today.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.750
All right.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.728
All right, go.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.601
Good good.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.140
Better. You're still doing
one thing wrong.

21:05.297 --> 21:08.210
It's what everyone does.
You're anticipating the recoil.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.280
Okay, you're expecting
the gun to kick up,

21:10.436 --> 21:12.211
so you're compensating
by pulling down.

21:12.338 --> 21:13.646
- Okay.
- By the time the gun kicks up,

21:13.806 --> 21:14.910
the bullet's long gone.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.782
Okay, so just forget about the recoil.
It doesn't matter

21:17.943 --> 21:20.355
every single time you pull the trigger.
Put your cans on.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.789
You'd be surprised by
how accurate you can get.

21:27.486 --> 21:31.093
Oh, look at you.
Very cute.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.895
Thank you.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.935
You're right though.
I do hesitate.

21:35.094 --> 21:38.541
It's like every time I get my target
between the crosshairs

21:38.697 --> 21:41.303
I wait a second and then
I start shaking, you know?

21:41.467 --> 21:43.504
You see, but you're not
hitting the target.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.910
The gun is. So you have
to trust the gun.

21:46.071 --> 21:48.551
- Okay.
- Breathe, line up your target

21:48.707 --> 21:50.653
and squeeze.
That's all you do.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.720
Look at that.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.356
Okay, you are now
officially even hotter.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.194
What?

22:04.356 --> 22:06.097
- Kiss me.
- No no no no.

22:06.258 --> 22:09.205
Wait a minute-- another free lesson
and you haven't taught me

22:09.361 --> 22:10.840
anything about firefighting.
Gimme my gun.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.304
Here you go

22:12.464 --> 22:15.001
Well, I don't have my equipment.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.942
And I need a fire, of course.

22:18.704 --> 22:19.876
Come on, tell me something.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.383
I wanna know-- what's your
favorite part about the job,

22:22.541 --> 22:24.418
besides scoring
hot chicks, of course?

22:24.577 --> 22:26.716
That's ridiculous.
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.722
Yeah right.

22:30.216 --> 22:32.389
You know, I just love being
part of that group.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.589
Going through all the things you go
through just to become a fireman.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.402
Those guys are my brothers.
I consider them family.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.403
So what's it really like?

22:43.562 --> 22:46.543
I don't know,
most calls are routine.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.009
Every once in a while
you get that--

22:49.168 --> 22:51.205
that call where
all hell's breaking loose

22:51.370 --> 22:54.840
and you got a structure
going up with people inside.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.510
To most people it looks like
a blazing monster, but I understand

22:57.676 --> 22:59.553
how it behaves,
how it progresses,

22:59.712 --> 23:02.693
the airflow, the ventilation,
materials, flashpoints,

23:02.848 --> 23:04.589
construction styles.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.593
I know how to get in,
I know how to get out.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.201
I know where I can go. I know
where I can't go. Things like that.

23:11.357 --> 23:14.031
But to the people inside,
all they see is fire and smoke.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.434
You know?
Just heat and blackness.

23:16.595 --> 23:19.439
And sometimes it happens where
that person who's trapped inside--

23:19.598 --> 23:22.204
they don't wanna go.
They panic, they freeze.

23:22.368 --> 23:24.712
Because where I need
to take them

23:24.870 --> 23:28.079
seems a hell of a lot worse
than the spot where they're still alive.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.120
- So what do you do?
- I get them to focus on me.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.420
I try to get their eyes.
I try to get their full attention,

23:36.582 --> 23:38.619
even through the mask
and the ventilator.

23:38.784 --> 23:41.287
I say the same thing
every time, no matter what,

23:41.453 --> 23:44.730
because it always works. Kind of like
what you taught me back there.

23:44.890 --> 23:47.268
What do you say?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.064
I say "Trust me.

23:49.228 --> 23:52.732
Do everything that I ask
and I promise you'll stay alive today."

23:56.468 --> 23:59.244
I miss it.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.654
So how long do I have
to be in Long Beach

24:06.812 --> 24:10.282
before I can start calling myself
a California girl?

24:30.769 --> 24:33.010
- Oh, here we go.
- Parking karma.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.708
Yeah.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.456
Jeremy, get down!

25:00.866 --> 25:02.573
Stay down, stay down.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.550
No-ooo!

25:10.709 --> 25:12.120
No!

25:13.846 --> 25:16.554
No! Please please!

25:17.883 --> 25:19.294
Two is down, one is up.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.192
It's okay, it's okay.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.764
You'll be okay. Hold on.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.992
I do not have a shot.

25:25.157 --> 25:28.570
Stay with me, stay with me.

25:32.664 --> 25:35.508
Move back.
We're gonna move back, come on.

25:43.842 --> 25:45.378
Come on, come on.

25:58.590 --> 26:01.036
- Darren.
- I'm hit, I'm hit.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.365
Stay down.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.523
Hey hey hey. It's okay.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.397
Oh shit.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.563
Hey hey he?

26:44.069 --> 26:46.572
Stay with me, come on.
Stay here.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.386
Somebody call 911!

27:03.655 --> 27:05.396
Take a deep breath.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.343
What?

27:20.506 --> 27:22.486
The bullet's in deep.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.247
I'm gonna give you more anesthetic.

27:40.792 --> 27:44.069
What's in the shot?

27:45.697 --> 27:48.371
I can't help you.
You need a trauma surgeon,

27:48.534 --> 27:50.673
a full OR with an anesthesiologist.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.749
We're too far from home.
I can't get you those things.

27:58.043 --> 28:01.889
- You emptied it, right?
- Of course I did.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.169
You wanna talk?

28:22.234 --> 28:24.180
No.

28:30.742 --> 28:32.847
You want the light?

28:35.113 --> 28:37.059
No.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.410
Hey, where is she?
Is she okay?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.104
The wounds are superficial.
She's fine.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.910
I need you to have a seat.
Have a seat and listen.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.945
Three days ago, a case manager

29:05.110 --> 29:07.886
at WITSEC headquarters
in DC was killed.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.957
It looked like a mugging.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.061
They took his watch,
took his wedding ring,

29:12.217 --> 29:13.958
wallet, cash.

29:14.119 --> 29:17.396
But as it turns out,
four hours before he died

29:17.556 --> 29:19.763
he accessed your file.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.235
So they paid him for your location

29:22.394 --> 29:25.432
and then they killed him to tie it up.

29:27.966 --> 29:30.469
Now, son,
this will never happen again.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.946
Access to your records
will be restricted

29:33.105 --> 29:34.846
to the executive office of WITSEC.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.749
All your communications
will be double blind.

29:37.909 --> 29:40.583
Full black box.
Go ahead.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.323
These were found
in the shooter's van.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.268
Oh my God.
You gotta be fucking kidding.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.846
Now I'm not judging anybody

30:04.002 --> 30:06.312
not tonight.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.042
I mean,
you're only human.

30:11.743 --> 30:14.451
But why do you think they went
after the both of you?

30:14.613 --> 30:17.617
Hell, you're the witness.
Why not go after you alone?

30:19.618 --> 30:21.689
Because you cared for her.

30:23.588 --> 30:26.694
So the safest thing for both of you
is to be nowhere near one another.

30:26.858 --> 30:29.134
No. No, you need
to let me be with her.

30:29.294 --> 30:30.796
I need to make sure
that she's safe.

30:30.962 --> 30:32.908
- No, she is safe.
- How do you know she's gonna be safe?

30:33.065 --> 30:35.375
She is safe. She's under guard
and wherever she's going--

30:35.534 --> 30:38.606
She's going with me, God damn it!
I need to see her!

30:38.770 --> 30:41.182
Marshal Durham is
on a plane and in the air.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.820
Hell, I don't even know
where it's heading.

30:43.975 --> 30:46.785
And that's for her safety
and for yours!

30:46.912 --> 30:49.483
- What do you mean? She's gone?
- She's gone.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.060
Your new identity is
already being arranged.

31:00.225 --> 31:03.172
When it's done, we'll take you
out of New Orleans.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.399
You've been erased.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.566
You don't exist.

31:07.733 --> 31:10.407
You're a ghost.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.845
But you'll be safe.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.748
When do I get to see her?

31:20.112 --> 31:22.183
Not till after the trial.

31:22.347 --> 31:24.418
You just sit tight.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.867
Hang onto yourself. The case
just bled out all over the street.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.270
There was a hit out on Jeremy,
a federal agent was shot.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.968
- Jeremy Coleman?
- Jeremy's off the grid.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.410
- What federal agent was shot?
- That's all the information I have.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.378
- Who are you talking to?
- The marshals in charge.

31:46.538 --> 31:47.573
All right. Get me on the phone
with them right now.

31:49.608 --> 31:52.384
Lieutenant Cella,
all due respect,

31:52.544 --> 31:56.253
this water's a fair bit deeper
than what you're used to.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.123
You're absolutely right.

32:00.218 --> 32:02.596
I'm just a small-town cop,

32:02.754 --> 32:05.598
so if you could help me
and pick out some small words

32:05.757 --> 32:08.636
and explain to me exactly
how you're gonna protect this guy.

32:08.794 --> 32:11.934
You know I can't provide
you with any details.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.976
Just tell me what kind
of protection you have.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.545
Well, the full weight and resources

32:17.702 --> 32:19.340
of the United States Marshals Service

32:19.538 --> 32:21.245
is being brought to bear.

32:21.406 --> 32:24.319
Yes, I can almost feel it right now.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.649
How about this?
Why don't you just give me the boy?

32:26.812 --> 32:29.418
All right?
He can sleep on my couch.

32:29.581 --> 32:32.994
I got cold beer in the fridge.
I have ESPN on the TV.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.153
I have a 9mm Beretta.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.790
I have a Ruger
Security Six .357 Magnum,

32:38.957 --> 32:41.665
a Remington 86 tactical shotgun.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.501
So you tell Hagan's men
if they wanna get this boy,

32:44.663 --> 32:46.506
they're gonna have
to go through me!

32:46.665 --> 32:49.441
Do you understand that,
you third-grade motherfuckers?

32:53.004 --> 32:56.008
Lieutenant, I realize how much
this case means to you.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.394
How's he doing?

33:07.586 --> 33:10.123
Well, he's better than I expected.

33:10.288 --> 33:11.995
He's a tough kid.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.206
I want you to tell him
something for me, please.

33:19.598 --> 33:22.078
I want you
to tell him that I said I'm sorry.

33:23.068 --> 33:25.048
Did you hear that?

33:25.203 --> 33:27.308
Tell him I said I'm sorry.

33:27.472 --> 33:30.419
You should tell him
you're sorry, too.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.389
I'm sorry to take up so much
of your time, Marshal.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.686
I know that the federal government
really doesn't--

34:01.640 --> 34:03.085
That's what we're doing.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.278
- The unit's open, it's all clear.
- All right.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.081
Why don't you go grab
what you need

34:07.245 --> 34:09.088
and then we'll get you
out of town.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.887
Hello.

34:47.052 --> 34:49.793
My man pulled
your girl's phone records.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.900
Now she dials this number
late at night,

34:54.059 --> 34:56.437
you talk for hours.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.470
See, now you and I,

35:00.632 --> 35:03.272
we never got to talk,
you know, just us.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.472
Yeah, that's a shame.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.909
I'm guessing

35:09.074 --> 35:11.315
you're with the police.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.891
You see,

35:17.048 --> 35:20.052
I can talk to you
in an honest way.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.495
See, in a way they can't.

35:23.655 --> 35:24.895
So let's just--

35:25.056 --> 35:27.662
let's just talk.
Just us, come on.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.601
All right.

35:32.163 --> 35:34.165
It's so simple.

35:34.332 --> 35:36.812
Don't testify

35:36.968 --> 35:39.278
and this will all be over with.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.815
No, it'll be over
once you're sentenced.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.748
You-- you've got--

35:43.908 --> 35:45.910
you've got that
all wrong, see, Jeremy.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.353
See, I go to prison

35:48.513 --> 35:51.494
and I keep running my crew.

35:51.650 --> 35:55.496
I'm gonna keep a contract out
on you and your girlfriend

35:55.654 --> 35:56.962
for as long as it takes.

35:57.122 --> 36:00.194
And this won't be over
until the both of you are dead.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.668
Now-- now that can
happen anywhere.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.636
Yeah.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.833
Let me see.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.205
How about

36:09.367 --> 36:11.369
Monticello, Indiana?

36:11.536 --> 36:13.174
At the lake house,

36:13.338 --> 36:16.148
where your girl's family
has reunions.

36:16.307 --> 36:19.550
I think the next one's in July.
I can't wait to go to that one.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.687
Hey, when are the two
of you getting married?

36:26.351 --> 36:28.490
I bet that's gonna be
a special day, huh?

36:28.653 --> 36:31.532
You gonna invite all your
family and friends...

36:31.690 --> 36:34.170
Craig, Adam,

36:34.325 --> 36:35.668
Trey!

36:35.827 --> 36:38.273
Carlos...

36:38.430 --> 36:40.501
and how about
a couple of my guys?

36:44.669 --> 36:47.206
Or maybe I'll just wait.

36:48.239 --> 36:49.877
You know,

36:50.041 --> 36:52.419
maybe I'll just wait for years

36:52.577 --> 36:55.581
until you and your girl,

36:55.747 --> 36:57.693
you got some kids of your own.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.762
Then my men..

37:02.620 --> 37:05.430
They'll come and kill them
while you watch.

37:07.092 --> 37:10.198
You see, what you don't
understand, Jeremy, is...

37:14.399 --> 37:16.845
prison time

37:17.001 --> 37:20.073
ain't nothing but time.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.411
Now you wanna live
the rest of your life

37:22.574 --> 37:24.952
knowing that one day--

37:25.110 --> 37:27.090
one day, son,

37:27.245 --> 37:29.486
I will find you?

37:29.647 --> 37:32.287
No, you're not gonna touch her.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.028
I'll kill you before I let that happen.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.330
Look,

37:43.495 --> 37:46.135
testify, don't testify,

37:46.297 --> 37:47.799
you're both dead anyway.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.502
That's just for talking back.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.443
No, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch, you're dead.

37:52.604 --> 37:53.947
You hear me?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.743
You are fucking dead.

37:55.907 --> 37:59.912
You tell me exactly how someone
like you's gonna kill me.

38:00.078 --> 38:02.786
Because I'm a ghost.
I don't exist.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.689
I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna kill you.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.455
I'm gonna disappear
and nobody will ever know.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.226
To hell with witness protection.

38:11.356 --> 38:13.131
You're gonna need
protection from me.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.328
I'm gonna need protection from you?

38:18.963 --> 38:20.499
Oh shit!

38:20.665 --> 38:23.669
I'm gonna need
protection from you.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.374
Shit.

38:29.674 --> 38:32.621
Fuck. Oh fuck. Fuck.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.960
Lost

38:43.288 --> 38:46.497
You've been
so lost to me

38:46.658 --> 38:49.002
And the cost

38:50.395 --> 38:54.639
It's killed me
to set you free

38:55.867 --> 38:57.369
But I...

38:57.535 --> 38:59.208
Why don't you go hurry him up?

38:59.370 --> 39:03.284
Just can't stand
to lose you now

39:03.408 --> 39:06.753
- No, I...
- Jeremy?

39:06.945 --> 39:09.221
Just can't stand

39:09.380 --> 39:13.055
To lose you now...

39:14.586 --> 39:16.361
How we doing?

39:18.223 --> 39:19.964
Jeremy?

39:21.659 --> 39:22.763
Ah

39:32.570 --> 39:34.743
Hey! He's running!

39:34.906 --> 39:36.408
Hey!

39:37.508 --> 39:39.681
- He's running!
- Stay off the radios!

39:39.844 --> 39:42.347
Find him,
but we've gotta keep this quiet

39:42.513 --> 39:43.753
for his own protection!

39:43.915 --> 39:45.758
Shit!

39:45.917 --> 39:48.727
I can't stand

39:48.887 --> 39:50.889
To lose you now

39:51.055 --> 39:54.366
I...

39:54.525 --> 39:58.371
Can't stand
to lose you now

39:58.529 --> 40:01.738
I...

40:01.900 --> 40:06.110
Can't stand
to lose you now

40:06.271 --> 40:09.582
No, I...

40:09.741 --> 40:14.121
Can't stand to lose

40:14.279 --> 40:18.421
You now...

40:32.230 --> 40:34.301
That's truly horrifying.

40:36.801 --> 40:38.109
Thank God Mr. Coleman

40:38.269 --> 40:40.806
survived these hideous
acts of random violence.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.651
How do you say that shit
with a straight face?

40:44.809 --> 40:45.810
Your Honor?

40:45.977 --> 40:48.150
The police are executing
search warrants right now

40:48.313 --> 40:50.691
on Hagan and all of his people.

40:50.848 --> 40:53.260
I'm confident those warrants
will prove fruitless.

40:53.418 --> 40:54.761
Come on,
physical proof or not,

40:54.919 --> 40:57.593
basic common sense says that
Hagan needs to be locked up.

40:57.755 --> 40:59.928
Your Honor, I'm asking you
to revoke that bail order.

41:01.326 --> 41:03.328
Your Honor,
may I speak plainly?

41:04.395 --> 41:05.840
If there was someone out there,

41:05.997 --> 41:07.977
operating independently of my client,

41:08.132 --> 41:10.669
attempting to bring harm
to Mr. Coleman,

41:10.835 --> 41:13.873
incarcerating my client
will do nothing to prevent that.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.348
In the absence
of actual evidence of any sort,

41:16.507 --> 41:18.987
all you'd be doing,
with due respect, Your Honor,

41:19.143 --> 41:21.783
is demonstrating extreme prejudice

41:21.946 --> 41:24.017
and providing me
with grounds for appeal

41:24.182 --> 41:26.321
of any future conviction,
not to mention

41:26.484 --> 41:29.488
grounds for a complete dismissal.
Now in regards to that,

41:29.654 --> 41:31.827
I welcome such an action.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.436
By all means, lock him up.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.884
Saw some robberies
and could be some missing bodies

41:50.041 --> 41:52.988
Another killing hat,
someone paying for this murder rap

41:53.144 --> 41:54.145
Fuck the Jimmy shit...

41:54.312 --> 41:57.225
Man, who's this Wonder-Bread-lookin'
motherfucker walkin' around?

42:00.385 --> 42:02.023
Hey, can I talk
to you guys for a second?

42:02.186 --> 42:04.132
You in the wrong
neighborhood, cuz.

42:04.288 --> 42:07.201
- I'm not looking for trouble.
- Nah, fuck that, man.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.463
You ought to get you a hat
that says "Undercover Cop."

42:09.594 --> 42:12.200
- I'm not a cop.
- You better not be, motherfucker,

42:12.363 --> 42:14.138
'cause you fucking suck at it.

42:14.298 --> 42:16.039
Keep on walking, cuz,

42:16.200 --> 42:18.202
you gonna scare off
my customers and shit.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.905
I am a customer.

42:20.938 --> 42:23.316
All right?
I want a gun.

42:23.474 --> 42:24.612
Gun store, homie.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.778
I want a gun that can't be traced.

42:26.944 --> 42:28.753
Look here, cuz.

42:28.913 --> 42:31.052
- We don't sell steel to white boys.
- I'm not looking for any--

42:31.215 --> 42:33.058
Jesus.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.958
God, oh!

42:35.153 --> 42:36.791
See what the fuck you did?

42:36.954 --> 42:39.730
Trying to tell your ass.
Now you done fuck with the muscle.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.930
Put your teeth on the curb, man.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.201
Hey, cuz, let me
"American History X" this boy.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.607
I always wanted to do that.

42:51.769 --> 42:54.511
- I'm not a cop!
- Shut the fuck up!

42:57.341 --> 42:59.878
L-- I need the gun
to kill David Hagan.

43:00.044 --> 43:02.115
I wanna kill David Hagan.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.256
Don't fuck with me, boy.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.419
Let's take a ride, cuz.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.588
Hey, Wonder Bread,
get your ass up.

43:12.957 --> 43:14.561
I got it.

43:14.725 --> 43:16.796
Get your ass in the car.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.669
No, fool, not the back seat.

43:22.834 --> 43:24.472
Get your ass in the trunk.

43:26.904 --> 43:28.747
I can ride in the back
fucking seat, man.

43:28.906 --> 43:30.977
Get your ass
in the motherfucking trunk!

43:32.143 --> 43:34.145
Put this on.

43:34.312 --> 43:37.156
You'll get there safe--
just in the dark.

43:52.096 --> 43:54.269
Lamar!

43:57.101 --> 43:59.103
Lamar!
We got company.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.624
Welcome to the Eastside.

44:08.779 --> 44:12.249
Yeah. Why you ain't up
in Bixby Knolls?

44:12.416 --> 44:15.022
- Problems at the country club?
- I ain't from Bixby Knolls.

44:15.186 --> 44:16.961
You sure as fuck
ain't from here either.

44:17.121 --> 44:19.533
So we got a white boy

44:19.690 --> 44:21.636
who wants to smoke Hagan.

44:21.792 --> 44:24.671
- Ain't this a bitch?
- It's a long story, but it's him or me.

44:24.829 --> 44:27.639
- And who are you?
- Nobody, cuz.

44:27.798 --> 44:29.971
That's right.
Nobody, literally nobody.

44:30.134 --> 44:31.841
But if I do pull this off,
Hagan'll be gone,

44:32.003 --> 44:33.539
and you guys can take the credit.

44:33.704 --> 44:36.150
I know that he's competition for you.

44:36.307 --> 44:38.548
I could be doing you guys a favor.

44:38.709 --> 44:40.450
Pffft.
Stone cold Bixby!

44:40.611 --> 44:44.684
Man, fuck this shit, man.
He wasting your fuckin' time, nigga.

44:44.849 --> 44:47.056
Let us take him
out the back, cuz. Trust me.

44:52.323 --> 44:54.997
Naw. He's a customer.

44:55.159 --> 44:56.399
C'mon.

45:13.744 --> 45:15.121
What a selection.

45:16.247 --> 45:18.193
Now what you trying to do, man,
you gonna need

45:18.349 --> 45:20.659
- some motherfuckin' weight. Trust me.
- The Glock 21.

45:20.785 --> 45:22.560
- The Glock 21?
- Yeah.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.030
You hear this white motherfucker?

45:25.189 --> 45:27.931
Glock 21, man, you could've got
this shit from Kmart, man!

45:28.092 --> 45:29.799
From aisle one
next to the Pampers!

45:29.961 --> 45:31.736
Look at this motherfucker,
take a look at that shit.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.705
We got AK-47s over here, dawg.

45:33.864 --> 45:36.242
- I don't know how to shoot the AK-47.
- Check this shit out, man.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.607
You tryin' to be the motherfucking
Grim Reaper and shit?

45:38.769 --> 45:41.773
- You gonna have to get grim.
- I learned how to shoot on this gun.

45:41.939 --> 45:43.680
- Fuck that.
- I learned how to fuck

45:43.808 --> 45:45.253
on this dumb bitch
at the rec center.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.411
Her grill all fucked up,
teeth sideways,

45:47.578 --> 45:49.785
throwing gang signs
and titties hanging 'em out.

45:49.947 --> 45:52.450
Man, I'm hard bangin' that shit, man,
but then I upgraded.

45:52.617 --> 45:54.688
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Hey, shut the fuck up!

45:54.819 --> 45:56.890
Enough of that shit, all right?

46:00.558 --> 46:02.560
Can I?

46:03.928 --> 46:05.430
Can this be traced?

46:05.596 --> 46:07.576
No, it can't be
motherfuckin' traced.

46:07.732 --> 46:09.643
The shit ain't even been fired.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.713
The serial number's been filed out.
That's virgin steel.

46:17.475 --> 46:20.922
Hey, look, now you wondering
if I think you can kill Hagan?

46:22.813 --> 46:25.191
I don't know
what the fuck you can do.

46:27.385 --> 46:29.592
But I think you could be trouble.

46:29.754 --> 46:31.734
You could occupy some of his time.

46:31.856 --> 46:36.202
Even if it's only 30 minutes when he
gain' somewhere to drop off your body.

46:38.763 --> 46:42.142
500 for the piece, man.
Bullets are on the house.

46:49.607 --> 46:51.348
Give it to him.

47:02.787 --> 47:04.425
I hope you got some gas money left

47:04.588 --> 47:07.194
in them motherfuckin' pockets
of yours, motherfucker.

47:50.935 --> 47:52.039
Jeremy?

47:52.203 --> 47:55.241
Yeah, I had a feeling
you'd answer this phone.

47:58.642 --> 48:00.644
I wasn't supposed to, but...

48:01.912 --> 48:03.516
I knew you'd call.

48:03.681 --> 48:05.957
How are you?

48:07.485 --> 48:10.056
I'm a little woozy,
a little tired, but...

48:11.355 --> 48:12.959
I'm fine.

48:13.124 --> 48:15.968
I'm just sad I missed
all your heroics.

48:16.127 --> 48:17.504
That's all right.

48:17.661 --> 48:20.403
It'll give me a chance
to exaggerate it later.

48:22.266 --> 48:24.109
Jeremy?

48:25.870 --> 48:28.146
You have to come back in.

48:28.305 --> 48:30.785
I know that things got bad,

48:30.941 --> 48:34.150
but you can't be
out there on your own.

48:34.311 --> 48:37.451
So wherever it is that you are,
please just go to a police station

48:37.615 --> 48:39.959
and tell them to call the marshals.

48:40.117 --> 48:42.620
Okay? You're not safe.

48:42.787 --> 48:44.460
But you are safe.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.296
That's the only thing
that matters to me.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.306
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that.

48:55.566 --> 48:58.274
Please don't do this to me.

48:59.537 --> 49:01.175
Jeremy?

49:03.607 --> 49:05.712
I love you.

49:08.712 --> 49:10.623
Get rid of this phone.

49:10.781 --> 49:13.318
I'm not gonna call you again.

49:13.484 --> 49:14.929
No, Jeremy»

49:52.022 --> 49:54.525
- What'd I fucking tell you?
- Oh shit.

49:54.692 --> 49:57.605
For fuck's sake!
Talk to him tomorrow.

49:57.761 --> 49:59.934
He's working at the Obispo.

50:00.064 --> 50:02.510
Right there.
Hands up!

50:02.666 --> 50:05.704
Jeremy fucking Coleman.

50:07.137 --> 50:08.775
You throw it away.

50:08.939 --> 50:10.543
Throw your fuckin' gun!

50:11.542 --> 50:14.045
Calm down.
Calm yourself down.

50:14.211 --> 50:15.713
- Around the corner.
- What?

50:15.880 --> 50:17.621
Get around the fucking corner!

50:20.818 --> 50:22.661
- It's Gethers.
- Hold on.

50:22.820 --> 50:25.096
All right. Later.

50:25.256 --> 50:26.701
What's up?

50:26.857 --> 50:29.201
He wants to talk about
your plea bargain.

50:30.194 --> 50:32.037
Oh, he does?

50:33.531 --> 50:36.068
Let's go run an errand.

50:36.233 --> 50:38.873
- Go to the fuckin' corner!
- This is a fuckin' big mistake.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.811
Shut the fuck up and get
against the wall.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.053
All right. Sit down.

50:48.212 --> 50:49.919
Back against the wall!

50:56.921 --> 50:58.696
Okay, now what?

50:58.856 --> 51:01.063
I'm gonna kill Hagan.

51:01.225 --> 51:03.296
- Is that so?
- That's right.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.906
What's "Obispo"?
Who's gonna be there?

51:08.299 --> 51:09.710
Throw me your phone.

51:14.572 --> 51:17.382
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a boxer.

51:17.541 --> 51:19.885
I worked and worked,

51:20.044 --> 51:22.046
but then I realized
it wasn't gonna happen,

51:22.212 --> 51:23.885
because I didn't have it in me.

51:25.683 --> 51:27.685
You tell me how to get to Hagan.

51:27.851 --> 51:30.593
Now you wanna be
some badass assassin,

51:30.754 --> 51:33.291
but you haven't got it in you.

51:37.962 --> 51:39.964
Dude, I will shoot you
in the fucking knee

51:40.130 --> 51:43.077
if you don't tell me how to get
to Hagan. Do you understand me?

51:51.241 --> 51:54.154
Henry Cooper had 4% body fat.

51:54.311 --> 51:57.190
Now do I look like
I've got 4% body fat?

51:57.348 --> 52:00.921
No. And you ain't gonna
pull that fucking trigger!

52:07.291 --> 52:09.134
Fuck!

52:13.163 --> 52:15.666
Wait wait! Fuck!

52:19.069 --> 52:21.071
Ah, so you're one of those, huh?

52:21.205 --> 52:22.650
Wait please.

52:24.908 --> 52:27.320
Whoo. Come on.
What you got there? What you got?

52:40.791 --> 52:41.963
Whoo-ee!

52:51.101 --> 52:53.138
Oh shit. Fuck.

52:53.303 --> 52:55.044
Fuck.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.493
The Aryan brother

53:08.652 --> 53:10.689
is without care.

53:12.823 --> 53:15.201
He walks where the weak

53:15.359 --> 53:18.499
and the heartless won't dare.

53:21.732 --> 53:25.236
For the Aryan brother, death holds

53:25.402 --> 53:28.281
no fear.

53:29.740 --> 53:32.516
Vengeance will be his...

53:34.144 --> 53:36.090
through his brothers

53:37.081 --> 53:38.992
still there.

54:25.129 --> 54:27.234
Oh shit, oh shit.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.277
Throw your weapons out!

54:41.311 --> 54:43.882
If you're hurt, I can help you,

54:44.047 --> 54:45.651
but you gotta throw out
your weapons!

55:29.526 --> 55:31.699
George, please tell me
that's not a dead guy.

55:31.862 --> 55:34.365
- It's a dead guy.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

55:34.531 --> 55:36.374
It's a terrible tragedy, huh?

55:36.533 --> 55:38.740
It's a fucked up weekend
is what it is.

55:38.936 --> 55:41.212
Fuck. Who is this?

55:41.371 --> 55:44.215
Looks like he gotjumped and his buddies
in the SUV down there,

55:44.374 --> 55:46.115
they came riding to the rescue,

55:46.276 --> 55:48.586
but I'm pretty sure it didn't work out.

55:48.745 --> 55:52.283
- What is that shit carved in his face?
- It's E.C., Eastside Crips.

55:52.416 --> 55:54.828
This is gang retaliation.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.224
Yeah. Yeah yeah,
what do you got for me?

56:02.559 --> 56:05.506
- Hey, Lieutenant?
- Hey, what's up?

56:05.662 --> 56:07.903
- I thought you should see this.
- What is it?

56:08.065 --> 56:10.671
Partial print.
It's not much, but I think

56:10.834 --> 56:12.245
- we can get a hit off of it.
- All right.

56:12.402 --> 56:15.246
Take this to the lab.
Get the results back to me.

56:15.405 --> 56:17.612
- Only me.
- Only you.

56:17.774 --> 56:18.912
Thanks, Paul.

56:23.914 --> 56:26.588
- Hello?
- Lieutenant Cella.

56:26.750 --> 56:29.526
- Who is this?
- I think it's time we met

56:29.686 --> 56:31.927
face to face.

57:53.937 --> 57:56.850
This just in, breaking news
out of Long Beach:

57:57.007 --> 58:00.682
a man nearly beaten to death. Let's go
now to our field reporter at the scene.

58:00.844 --> 58:04.291
The victim, Craig Tucker,
is listed in critical condition.

58:04.448 --> 58:07.019
Those injuries are described
as being very severe,

58:07.184 --> 58:10.631
and it is not immediately clear
whether or not he will recover.

58:10.787 --> 58:13.666
A police spokesman says
the search for suspects is ongoing.

58:13.824 --> 58:16.998
But they have no further comment.
Back to you.

58:17.160 --> 58:20.198
In other news,
citizens are outraged...

58:29.373 --> 58:32.980
- Wait for me.
- Come on, slowpoke.

58:33.143 --> 58:35.487
No no, I'm heading
to the hospital before my shift.

58:35.645 --> 58:38.057
Shh shh shh shh.

58:38.215 --> 58:39.660
- Uh...
- Shut it off.

58:39.816 --> 58:41.762
Yeah.
Look, I'll see you there.

58:41.918 --> 58:43.226
No questions,

58:43.387 --> 58:45.389
just listen to me.

58:45.555 --> 58:48.126
I need you to do exactly
what I tell you to do, okay?

58:48.291 --> 58:50.567
- Okay. Yeah.
- I need you to let everybody know

58:50.727 --> 58:54.072
that they gotta be very careful
right now. Nobody stays at their place.

58:54.231 --> 58:57.405
Call the police and say that threats
have been made against the firehouse.

58:57.567 --> 59:00.411
Get a police detail, not only
on the station, but on all your runs.

59:00.570 --> 59:01.708
You kidding me?
You know it's not that easy.

59:01.872 --> 59:05.012
Just do it! Okay?
Just fucking do it!

59:06.410 --> 59:08.321
And don't tell anybody
that you've seen me.

59:08.478 --> 59:10.583
Nobody-- not the guys,
not Maria, nobody.

59:12.416 --> 59:15.761
I can't see fucking Craig and he's
sitting in the fucking hospital!

59:20.390 --> 59:22.028
Is he gonna be okay?
Have they heard?

59:22.192 --> 59:25.503
I don't know, man.
It's not looking good.

59:26.797 --> 59:28.970
Jeremy, talk to me, dude.
What are you doing?

59:29.166 --> 59:31.237
Just no questions, please!

59:33.937 --> 59:35.939
So how's Maria?
Is she good?

59:38.442 --> 59:40.080
You met somebody.

59:44.114 --> 59:45.616
Yeah.

59:45.782 --> 59:48.922
I just hope to God you guys get
a chance to meet her someday.

59:50.053 --> 59:51.964
I need you to do me a favor.

59:52.122 --> 59:54.068
All my fire gear is
over at the fire house.

59:54.224 --> 59:57.671
Before your shift, I need you
to go drop my duffel bag off

59:57.828 --> 01:00:00.138
over in the park
behind those benches, okay?

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:03.211
And one more thing.

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.377
If you don't hear from me
in the next few days,

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.812
I need you to take this.
There's a letter next to the bed.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:11.316
Take it to the US Marshals' Service,
all right?

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:14.217
- They'll know how to get it to her.
- Who is she?

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:16.486
Just..

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.557
Just do it for me.

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.989
Yeah. All right.

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:28.000
Okay.

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:42.679
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up, Paul?

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.784
So I ran that print.

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:53.519
It came back with a hit.
It's in the system, this person,

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.822
the only problem is
it's coming back with no ID.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.363
- No name, no nothing?
- No.

01:00:57.521 --> 01:00:59.194
I figure it must
have been in there,

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:01.165
but for some reason

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.895
it got taken out?
You ever heard of that?

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.198
No.

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:10.734
Thank you.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:42.072
- This is dispatch.
- Mike Cella.

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:45.304
- Lieutenant?
- I need to put out an APB on a suspect.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:48.681
Go ahead with your description.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.951
Lieutenant?

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.091
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Sir?

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:01.422
No no, I don't have
the right information yet.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:17.238
This is Talia Durham.
Badge 4382.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.038
I need an override
on a blocked number

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:22.274
incoming to my old cell
last night around 12:00.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.946
Area code 562? That's--

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:31.592
that's Long Beach, California, right?

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.720
It's a cell. Great.

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.455
Thank-- thank you.

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:57.910
Hi, yes.
I need a cab to the airport.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:01.956
No, right now.
Thank you.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.420
That V8 is rumbling

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:37.892
I feel right at home

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:42.586
When I push the hammer down

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:45.858
I hear the engine moan

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:49.865
I'm up in seventh heaven

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.802
And I don't wanna come down

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:59.007
'Cause I'm alive when
I hear that Mustang sound

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:06.712
Yeah, I'm alive when I hear
that Mustang sound

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:14.723
This is a lifetime affair...

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.864
Welcome to the party, motherfucker!

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:25.073
God damn.
Jeremy Coleman!

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:28.368
Hagan's gonna love me.
I'm bringing you back alive!

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.944
Hell, he just might make me
employee of the motherfucking week!

01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:34.909
What?
You want that?

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:37.244
Do you want this gun, huh?
Is this what you want?

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.080
You ain't gettin' it, motherfucker.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:41.188
You in my house now,
you hear me?

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:43.517
You don't bring no gun
to my fuckin' party.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.887
Who do you think you are,
comin' in here?

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.585
Act like you own
this fuckin' place.

01:04:47.751 --> 01:04:50.061
I'm gonna stick this gun
right up your ass.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.097
God damn it!

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:54.735
Ah ahhh ahhh.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.564
My fuckin' leg!

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:07.138
Get up and crawl,
you son of a bitch.

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:10.773
Right here.
Sit right there.

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:21.559
You caught me at a bad time.
I'm about to kill some Crips.

01:05:21.718 --> 01:05:24.096
I put a trace
on the marshal's credit cards.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.791
Nothing since New Orleans.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.163
Today she bought
a last-minute plane ticket.

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.929
I'm already here in Long Beach.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:34.871
There's only one reason
she'd leave protection and come here.

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:36.306
He's here.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.574
God damn it.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:46.110
I need you to tell me
how to get to Hagan.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.721
Where does he go?

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.982
- When is he alone?
- Blood in, blood out.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:51.625
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.455
To get in with Hagan,
you gotta kill somebody--

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.790
blood in.
Once you're in,

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.297
the only way out's
if you're dead-- blood out.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.901
So fuck you!

01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:04.301
Mr. Hagan, your men were
killed by Jeremy Coleman.

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:08.498
Well, it looks
like I misjudged him.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:10.736
It's a good thing.
He's coming right to us.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.313
- I didn't wanna have to do this.
- Heh, didn't--

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.748
You have any idea
who you're fucking with, huh?

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:20.444
I read your rap sheet--
all the things you've done,

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.317
all the people
you've done them to.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.686
It's gonna make this part
a little bit easier.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:26.384
Let me the fuck up outta here!

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.860
I guess you didn't do your job.
I guess I will.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.863
I'm gonna hunt him down.

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.467
How will you hunt him down?

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:36.331
Stake out his house?
He doesn't live anywhere.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.336
Storm his office?

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:41.203
He doesn't work anywhere.
You have no point of access.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.139
I'm gonna take your fingers off.

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.074
You ain't got the balls.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:49.041
Love will make you do
some fucked up things.

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:51.151
Fuck!

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:58.691
Look, I just wanna
know one thing.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.953
Are you gonna earn your money?

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:04.095
Jeremy is a ghost, but so am I.

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:06.029
- Just tell me!
- Fuck you!

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:07.395
She's gonna die slow!

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:10.231
God, no!
God damn it!

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:14.003
I'll fucking tell you!

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:16.268
I'll find him.
Until then...

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:19.170
I'd watch your back.

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:23.977
- Fucking talk!
- Gathers.

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:26.053
Gethers keeps the list.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.917
You get to Gethers and that's how
you get to fuckin' Hagan.

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:32.287
Now out me the fuck lose, man!
I told you what you wanted to know.

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:35.429
- Blood out, motherfucker.
- No.

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:41.997
Mike Cella.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:43.604
This is Talia Durham.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.603
I just got your email.
Can you talk?

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:48.106
You bet. I'm just trying
to figure out a gang war.

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.608
It doesn't look like
either side started it.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:53.543
Do you have any evidence
that's leading you in another direction?

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.483
Marshal,

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:00.712
we should be careful what
we talk about on the phone.

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:03.084
- Have you told anyone?
- No.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:06.557
Jeremy told me what happened
to your partner. I'm sorry.

01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:10.288
Listen,

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:12.455
I want him dead and buried
as much as you do,

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.898
but I'm still a cop.
You understand that?

01:08:15.058 --> 01:08:16.969
I came to stop
what's happening.

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:19.935
- You can stop it, Marshal?
- As soon as I can find him, yeah.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.041
You have until 6:00.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:26.408
After that he goes out
on NCIC. as a suspect.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.981
Thanks, Lieutenant.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:33.145
Detective Cella.
I just got off with CSU.

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:35.185
They found more blood
in the alley from the other night,

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:37.154
might be from one
of our perps, but--

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.314
But you didn't get
a match from CODIS.

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:41.826
Yeah, that's right.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.055
Keep trying-

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.131
Call me if you get something.

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:13.848
Hey!

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:16.547
Mr. Coleman,
just stay right there, don't move.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:26.164
I'm just guessing,
but I think the fire department

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:28.360
is probably not
on its way, yeah?

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.162
I turned off the call signal.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:31.772
Ah, huh.

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:38.006
You know,
I don't know who's worse--

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:41.273
a man who kills a son
in front of his own father

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:46.084
or a man who gets paid to make sure
he gets to kill some more.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.119
Just for the record,

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.190
I never wanted to become
the man that you think I am.

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:54.488
I happen to believe in this
adversarial system of justice of ours.

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.460
I happen to believe in it
with my whole heart.

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:00.567
The prosecutor
and defendant go at it,

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:03.135
the best advocate wins.
It's an excellent system.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:05.772
It just leads to
a bizarre world sometimes,

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.805
where someone like me--

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:10.035
reputable and legitimate»

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:11.803
finds himself fighting on behalf

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:14.244
of the worst scum of the earth
like David Hagan.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.145
Why do you represent him?

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.753
Why do I represent him?

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:23.151
I drop a man like David Hagan,

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:26.122
and he kills me,
then he kills my whole family

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.491
and then he kills my dog
just for the heck of it!

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:34.260
I didn't come here to harm you.

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:38.165
I never wanted to kill anybody.

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.635
Even Hagan.

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.005
But I cannot let him take
the lives of the people

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:46.773
that I love.
Do you understand that?

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:07.294
What are you gonna do? Huh?

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.665
How are you gonna get to him? He's got
a whole army around him at all times.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.000
I got to you, didn't I?

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.336
Look, I've come this far,
I can finish this.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.480
Just tell me where he's gonna be.

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:26.548
I know where he goes some nights.

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:29.879
Tonight.

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:32.747
Mmm, I bet you're wishing
you hadn't come alone.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.946
That's not what I wish.

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:39.949
I'm gonna tell you
why I brought you here.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.594
It's 'cause I'm confused.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:47.633
You know, I'm wondering
why you didn't do anything

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:51.671
about those friends I lost.

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:55.140
That's one of the seven deadly sins:

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:57.278
sloth,

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.937
failure to utilize
your talents and gifts.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.741
The news says

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:04.851
it's looking like homicide.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.918
Yeah, it was homicide.

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.651
I just haven't gotten around to it.

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.587
I've been a little busy with the trial.

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:13.658
Oh.

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.591
Have you heard from your witness?

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:19.065
Yeah.

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:21.827
Looks like he's been a little busy too.

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.997
I'll tell you what:

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:28.165
we oughta skip the trial.
You'll save some time,

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:30.504
kill me.

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:34.407
Come on.
I won't blame you.

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:37.950
Every man's got his dark side.

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:40.553
Just shoot me.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.815
Come on.

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.718
What's the matter?
Your gun broke?

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.996
No.

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.895
It works just fine.

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:58.704
Justice. You see,

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:01.899
there ain't enough of that
going around for the white man.

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:05.003
Yes.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.341
Not enough of that going around
for murderers either.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:12.209
I'm gonna kill that boy.

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:16.747
I'm gonna

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.552
bleed him out like a sow.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.357
I lost a lot of good people.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:26.398
And that hurts me.
It does. It really does.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.761
And you know
what that's like 'cause,

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:33.668
as I recall, you--

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:36.571
you lost some good people, too,
some friends

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:38.370
I've been told.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.070
Yeah.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.577
Close friends.

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:49.550
You're not gonna kill anyone else.

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:21.448
Hey, cry baby.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:24.113
Come on, get up.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.056
Get up off your ass! Get up!
Get up off your ass, go!

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.793
As you can see, it has been
a bloody day in Long Beach.

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:39.132
A long simmering feud
between the Eastside Grips

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:42.299
and a rival white-power gang
has now exploded

01:16:42.465 --> 01:16:44.445
into all-out warfare.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.443
It began last night with the slaying

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.082
of three soldiers of Aryan crime boss

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.309
David Hagan,
and there have been multiple...

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:53.647
Adam, you've got
a Marshal Durham here to see you.

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:56.312
So really a horrific
bloody crime scene out here.

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:58.390
Now back to you in the studio.

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:02.924
Has anyone approached you
recently about Jeremy Coleman?

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:05.827
Look, it'd be weird if I had
heard from him, right?

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:08.662
It happens.
Witnesses get distraught,

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:11.566
they make mistakes.

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:14.265
I keep them safe from everyone,

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:16.467
including themselves.

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:21.678
You know Jeremy lost
his folks when he was young?

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.943
That was one of the things
he loved about this job.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:29.146
You know, it feels like a family.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:30.984
But I worry about him

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:34.890
because even though this
feels like a family, it's not really.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:37.496
Now you gotta have more
in your life.

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:43.463
Look, if he--
if he did find someone

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:45.606
that he really cared about...

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:49.502
I think he would
do anything for her.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.210
Things that might even
be hard to accept.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.317
Where is he, Adam?

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:03.289
Look, if I do hear from him,
do you have a card or something?

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:05.391
Yeah, I do and normally
I would give you one

01:18:05.548 --> 01:18:07.550
and tell you to call our field office,

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:12.056
but I'm not here officially.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.893
I'm trying to keep this off the books.

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:22.503
And I have until the end of the day

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.941
and then no one can help him.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.491
There.

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:51.066
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:56.267
Thanks so much for waiting.

01:18:56.432 --> 01:18:58.343
Do you know where
the Loam Motel is?

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.241
You bet.

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:17.627
Talia.

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:22.835
You wrote this in case you died.

01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:26.735
And when I read it,
I thought you already had.

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:29.774
So now I know exactly
how it feels!

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:33.141
- Look, I had to do this.
- Now you have to stop.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:36.579
Hagan will never stop,
do you hear me?

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:40.016
He's never gonna stop. He's gonna
keep coming for you and for me

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:42.280
and your family.
My best friend in the world

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.082
is in the hospital right now.

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.418
Hey, look at me.

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:50.156
I love you.

01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:56.160
And this is what it's gonna take for us
to be together, do you hear me?

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:57.998
Yes.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.663
I've had to do some awful things
the last couple of days,

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.831
but you're worth it.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.177
Do you understand me?

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.576
The police know that it's you!

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:15.019
Lieutenant Cella, he figured it out.

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:17.783
And if I don't get you out
of Long Beach by 6:00 p.m.,

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:19.983
he's gonna put your face
on the wire.

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:24.359
Look, I let you in.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.363
I can't go back to no one.

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:29.131
We can have a life together, but--

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.032
- I can finish this.
- No.

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:33.764
- Just let me finish this.
- This isn't you.

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:36.467
Please, tell me this isn't you.

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.710
Leave with me.

01:20:41.804 --> 01:20:43.715
Please.

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:55.929
What what what what?

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.734
Oh my God,
what did you do?

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:10.101
Stay here, okay? Just stay
right here, I'll be right back.

01:21:24.847 --> 01:21:27.293
No no no no! Jeremy!

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:28.962
Jeremy!

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:32.232
Think!

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:47.436
Cella.

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:49.048
It's quitting time.
You should go home.

01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:53.911
You really think so, Jeremy?

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:56.147
You think it's quitting time?

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:58.518
Look, just one more night.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.557
All right?
Let it play out.

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:05.963
Kid, you left a fingerprint.

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:15.700
Lieutenant, if I don't finish this,
she'll never be safe.

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:18.640
They found a fingerprint.

01:22:18.801 --> 01:22:21.008
Do you understand
what that means?

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:24.117
That means they're gonna find
more forensic evidence.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.184
They're gonna put you away.

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:28.582
You can't do this by yourself.

01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:30.485
Yes, I can.

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:32.887
I have no choice.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:34.824
Just let it happen?

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:37.361
You've reached the voice-mail
for Lieutenant Michael Cella,

01:22:37.553 --> 01:22:39.032
Gang and Narcotics Division.

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:41.031
Please leave a message
after the tone.

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:42.931
Hey, I'm coming to you.

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:45.093
I'll be at your office as soon
as I can find a cab--

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.803
You do what you have to do,
but tonight David Hagan

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:54.914
is going in the ground.

01:22:55.037 --> 01:22:56.846
Wait! Wait!

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:05.454
I'm over here.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.666
Where is he, huh?
Where is he?

01:24:39.141 --> 01:24:40.142
Yeah?

01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:43.051
David Hagan, current location

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:45.088
1124 Oxholm Street.

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:47.284
Hey, do me a favor
and leave your phone on.

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:48.894
- I wanna hear this.
- Jeremy?

01:24:49.051 --> 01:24:50.052
Jeremy!

01:24:51.887 --> 01:24:54.925
Listen, boy, you should not want
what you cannot have.

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.065
Oh shit!

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.432
Oh shit!

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.796
Jeremy!

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.060
I'm in here!

01:26:37.059 --> 01:26:38.060
I'm in here! Damn it!

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:40.501
Talia!

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.578
Talia!

01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:47.372
No!

01:27:58.974 --> 01:28:00.976
Jeremy!

01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:03.316
Talia!

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:12.328
We gotta get out of here.

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:14.698
Okay, come on!

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:17.302
Stay with me.
Okay, come on.

01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:26.479
Come on, stay low! Stay low!

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.520
Okay, come on. Let's go.

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:43.458
Stay with me.
Come on, let's go.

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.291
Let's go.
Let's keep moving.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:47.800
Jeremy!

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:52.705
Jeremy!

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:35.845
Come here, boy!

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.708
I'm over here!

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.919
Almost, boy.

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:24.591
Almost.

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:28.461
You were almost
strong enough to pull it off.

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:31.399
But your girlfriend Talia,
she's gonna die.

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.505
Die, boy!

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:38.434
You know what I think?

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.807
I think you just didn't
love her enough.

01:30:40.969 --> 01:30:42.642
No.

01:31:06.695 --> 01:31:08.333
Son of a bitch!

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:10.339
Die, boy!

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.466
He's gone. Come on.

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:37.034
- Let's go, let's go.
- Yeah.

01:32:07.389 --> 01:32:09.733
I need you to trust me.

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:16.068
Do everything that I ask
and I promise we'll survive this.

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:18.673
Do you trust me?

01:32:20.301 --> 01:32:21.336
Yeah.

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:57.347
Did they find anything
at all in that building?

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:59.951
The entire building was torched.

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:02.281
Nothing useful.

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:20.466
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
