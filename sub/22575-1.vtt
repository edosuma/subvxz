00:07.575 --> 00:11.143
<i> On December 12th</i>
<i>at precisely 1:13 p.m.,</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:12.511
<i>snow falls on Chicago.</i>

00:14.915 --> 00:18.117
<i>A single snowflake is birthed
from a cumulonimbus cloud</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:20.119
<i>10,000 feet above Lincoln Park.</i>

00:25.159 --> 00:27.559
<i>It doesn't reach the ground
for 45 minutes.</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:35.100
<i>At 1:58, the snowflake lands
on the cheek of Edith Struit.</i>

00:36.470 --> 00:38.237
<i>For their 50th anniversary,</i>

00:38.272 --> 00:39.671
<i>her husband, Irv,
brings to life</i>

00:39.707 --> 00:41.273
<i>Edith's most prized treasure.</i>

00:44.445 --> 00:46.345
<i>The music box
her mother gave them</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:47.946
<i>on the night of their wedding.</i>

00:51.986 --> 00:54.920
<i>Five miles away,
Martin Hamilton awaits a visit</i>

00:54.955 --> 00:56.855
<i>from his sister, Clara,</i>

00:56.891 --> 00:59.958
<i>with whom he's been estranged
for the past ten years.</i>

01:02.730 --> 01:05.164
<i>She gives him
a black Labrador Retriever.</i>

01:06.967 --> 01:09.735
<i>The same dog Martin lost
eight months prior.</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:13.772
<i>Returned to his master</i>

01:13.808 --> 01:17.142
<i>as if not a single day
had passed.</i>

01:17.178 --> 01:20.012
<i>Along the Gold Coast,
Louis and Christina Selter</i>

01:20.047 --> 01:22.047
<i>lead their 12-year-old son,
Matthew,</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:25.384
<i>on what he believes
is a moonlight stroll.</i>

01:25.419 --> 01:27.319
<i>Too sick to go to Space Camp,</i>

01:27.354 --> 01:30.155
<i>Matthew has spent the past week
holed up in his room</i>

01:30.191 --> 01:32.825
<i>reading
Air And Space Magazine.</i>

01:32.860 --> 01:34.893
<i>He's filled with joy
when he discovers</i>

01:34.929 --> 01:37.963
<i>a gleaming new telescope
aimed directly at the star</i>

01:37.998 --> 01:40.566
<i>that's been named after him.</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:43.502
<i>A small piece of the universe
that belongs to him,</i>

01:43.537 --> 01:47.339
<i>but is shared with everyone
in the universe.</i>

01:47.374 --> 01:50.542
<i>And in a
smart-and-tastefully-done house</i>

01:50.578 --> 01:53.078
<i>in the desirable West Chicago,</i>

01:53.114 --> 01:56.415
<i>Tom Jacobs
checks his phone and smiles,</i>

01:56.450 --> 01:59.918
<i>who is the architect
of these dreams come true.</i>

01:59.954 --> 02:02.754
<i>If he does his job well,
they'll never know.</i>

02:02.790 --> 02:06.325
<i>And for Tom,
that's all it is, a job,</i>

02:06.360 --> 02:08.693
<i>one he happens to be
very good at.</i>

02:08.729 --> 02:11.430
<i>I should know because I'm him.</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:14.066
<i>I'm always able to find
the perfect gift</i>

02:14.101 --> 02:15.734
<i>no matter the occasion,</i>

02:15.769 --> 02:18.737
<i>but Christmas is my specialty.</i>

02:18.772 --> 02:22.841
<i>That's how I earned
my nickname, Mr. Christmas.</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:38.056
Oh, I forgot how much
I love Chicago.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.636
You know, there's so much
character here,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.760
so much history.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.396
You know, there's a lot
of history at home, too, so...

02:44.431 --> 02:46.899
Okay,
what LA considers historic

02:46.934 --> 02:48.634
is an 80-year-old hotdog stand.

02:51.505 --> 02:55.374
Hey, uh, I'm really glad
you're here.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.075
I know it was a, a big ask,

02:57.111 --> 02:59.378
you missing holidays
with your family.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.812
Okay, I told you
a million times.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.481
- Don't worry about it.
- All right.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.261
- Seriously, I want to be here.
- All right, all right.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.329
Besides, I get to experience
snow during Christmas again.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.887
- That's true. That's true.
- Oh, pizza.

03:08.923 --> 03:10.489
We should do
a walking pizza tour.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.558
Come on, tonight,
after the movie?

03:12.593 --> 03:15.327
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I just,
I gotta, I gotta swing by home.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.062
- Before the movie, okay?
- Okay.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.998
'Cause I have that conference
call in... 25 minutes.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.233
- I gotta go.
- Oh, okay.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.801
- I gotta go. Bye.
- All right, bye.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.504
Okay, I'll pick you up
at 2:00!

to New Year's yet?

03:56.003 --> 03:58.103
Yeah, Christmas
is all wrapped up.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.038
Lovely to see you, Victoria.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.107
I knew I'd find you here.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.543
Why a man of your acumen
would choose to work

04:04.578 --> 04:08.847
in such a quaint place,
I will never understand.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.616
Yes, I'm sure that's true.

04:10.651 --> 04:14.152
Have a seat.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

04:14.188 --> 04:16.288
Oh, I just wanted
to let you know

04:16.322 --> 04:19.658
that the gift you got for mother
was a raving success.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.994
I haven't seen
her happy like that in ages.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.029
And getting her
out of the country

04:24.064 --> 04:25.564
for an entire season?

04:25.599 --> 04:26.910
I didn't realize
I would be getting a gift

04:26.934 --> 04:28.233
out of this deal, as well.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.068
I can't
thank you enough.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.204
I'm glad you're happy,
but a simple phone call

04:32.239 --> 04:33.905
would have been sufficient.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.807
And how would I have seen
that handsome face?

04:35.843 --> 04:38.510
Besides, social graces compel me

04:38.545 --> 04:40.379
to invite you over for dinner
in person.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.047
Dinner?

04:42.082 --> 04:44.082
I told you
I'm very appreciative.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.318
I wanna thank you.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.053
Your ample fee
was payment enough.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.256
Oh, nonsense. Let a lady
treat you to a proper meal.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.425
You'll come, won't you?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.938
You didn't make me
come all the way down here

04:54.962 --> 04:56.228
just to be shot down?

04:57.264 --> 04:58.497
How can I miss it?

04:58.532 --> 05:01.333
Wonderful. How's Saturday?

05:01.368 --> 05:03.702
We can eat at mother's,
and with her being gone,

05:03.737 --> 05:06.338
it'll just be the two of us
in that great, big house.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.773
And the staff.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.242
Oh, Tom. They don't count.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.912
Well, I'm off.
No rest for the divine.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.748
I will see you Saturday.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.685
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Thank you. I will.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.804
Paul? Hello?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.428
Are you in there?

05:29.463 --> 05:32.864
Paul? Hello? Hm.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.099
Paul.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.803
Hey, what's the deal?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.983
I've been upstairs ringing
the doorbell for ten minutes.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.709
- Sorry. Five minutes. Tops.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.711
Yeah, we'll get it done.
We'll get it done.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.549
End day.
Yeah, yeah.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.117
Sure. Sure, sure,
whatever you need.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.953
- Whatever you need.
- Oh.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.766
Yeah, well, he's not
the center of the universe

05:56.790 --> 05:58.857
and he needs to understand that.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.997
Jimbo. Obviously.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.477
No, no, no, I love you.
You're beautiful.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.334
You're beautiful.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.470
Yeah, end of day?

06:11.505 --> 06:13.171
I'm sorry,
this is nowhere near done.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.607
No, it's fine.
Handle your business.

06:14.641 --> 06:15.941
Yeah. You should...

06:15.976 --> 06:17.187
You should go to the movie
without me

06:17.211 --> 06:18.355
and I'll catch up with you
after.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.845
Okay, and we can do the,

06:19.880 --> 06:21.079
the, uh, pizza thing.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.314
No, you know what, it's...

06:22.349 --> 06:23.582
Hey, it's not even a problem.

06:23.617 --> 06:24.994
I should be at home packing,
anyway.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.329
Okay, yeah, no, no, no, Jim,
I'm right here.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.452
Yeah, yeah, Jim. Yeah, Jim.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.121
I'm right here with you.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.789
- Love you.
- Love you.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.259
Yeah.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.362
Look, we're making
lemonade. Okay?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.998
Yeah, yeah, if you need to move
that deadline up, we got it.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.470
Hundo percento.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.407
Yeah, obviously.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.478
Max, take a deep breath.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.625
We still have a couple of months
before Valentine's Day.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.016
That is plenty of time.
Trust me.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.618
I do this for a living.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.131
<i> I've been working</i>
<i>on the questions, Tom.</i>

07:01.155 --> 07:02.732
Great, all right,
well, you just worry about

07:02.756 --> 07:04.890
filling out a profile
and I'll handle the rest.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.358
<i>- I'm relying on you.</i>
- Okay.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.126
- Talk to you later. Bye.
<i>- Okay. Bye.</i>

07:15.335 --> 07:17.469
No way. Who is it?

07:17.504 --> 07:19.538
- Hey, it's Paul.
- Paul?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.508
- Tom Jacobs.
- Paul?

07:23.544 --> 07:24.544
Tau Sig.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.515
- Sure. Uh, Tau Sig.
- Nice. Can I come in?

07:32.753 --> 07:35.353
- So you wanna hire me?
- Yes.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.189
How did you find out about me?

07:37.224 --> 07:40.358
Tau Sig, man. You should really
think about advertising.

07:40.394 --> 07:42.394
I never would've found you
otherwise.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.397
You know the old saying,
"It's the thought that counts"?

07:45.432 --> 07:48.433
Well, now, the perfect gift
becomes a lot less perfect

07:48.469 --> 07:50.035
when the recipient finds out

07:50.070 --> 07:51.937
that the gift
actually came from the guy

07:51.972 --> 07:53.905
whose face is on a bus stop.

07:53.941 --> 07:58.109
So your clients get the perfect
gift and all the credit?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.412
- That's the idea.
- Good.

08:00.447 --> 08:04.916
Paul, I kinda have a rule about
not taking on people as clients

08:04.952 --> 08:06.718
who I have a relationship with.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.754
It-it can get personal.
It can get messy.

08:09.790 --> 08:13.091
Look, man,
I really need your help.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.227
Okay,
just look at her.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.297
Her name is Jenny.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.067
- Wow!
- I know, right?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.969
I'm crazy about her.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.637
And I-it's only been a year

08:25.672 --> 08:27.650
and-and she moved out to Chicago
a little after me.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.407
And, yeah,
we're not living together.

08:29.443 --> 08:30.976
And that's fine, I get it.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.477
Space, independent lives,
et cetera, et cetera,

08:33.514 --> 08:36.982
but things have been...

08:37.017 --> 08:40.284
Things have been
a little tense recently.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.821
And w-we're kind of in, uh...

08:42.856 --> 08:44.422
- Some sort of rut?
- Okay.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.324
And I'm looking
for that grand gesture,

08:46.360 --> 08:48.326
you know,
t-to get things back on track

08:48.362 --> 08:51.763
'cause I don't think
I'm gonna do better than this.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.766
I need a gift, man.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.735
I'm looking
for <i> the</i> Christmas gift.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.504
That is
less than three weeks away.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.974
That is not enough time, man.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.443
- Sorry.
- Please?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.814
- I'll think about it.
- Thank you.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.883
But I'm not making any promises.

09:12.986 --> 09:13.986
Heard.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.958
All right, well, before
I decide to take you on...

09:21.828 --> 09:24.429
you need to fill out
one of these.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.435
- What is it?
- This is Jenny in a nutshell.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.372
That's step one.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.776
And if I decide it's a good fit,
then we go on from there.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.156
<i> People</i>
<i>are remarkably simple.</i>

09:51.191 --> 09:55.193
<i>We like to think we're all
beautiful, unique snowflakes...</i>

09:55.228 --> 09:56.895
<i>but when you really
get down to it,</i>

09:56.930 --> 09:58.663
<i>we're all just
slight variations</i>

09:58.699 --> 10:00.365
<i>of the same clump of ice.</i>

10:04.538 --> 10:08.173
<i>Case in point. Question one.
Likes and dislikes?</i>

10:08.208 --> 10:11.643
<i>According to a national study,
52% of US population</i>

10:11.678 --> 10:13.545
<i>would say they like puppies.</i>

10:13.580 --> 10:14.946
Remarkable.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.822
<i>Okay, maybe some ice clumps</i>

10:23.857 --> 10:26.891
<i>have more points than others,</i>

10:26.927 --> 10:29.027
<i>but they're still just clumps.</i>

10:36.069 --> 10:38.336
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Mm-hmm.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.080
Hm...

10:49.116 --> 10:51.383
<i>Of course, not everyone
is good at sharing</i>

10:51.418 --> 10:52.917
<i>their intimate feelings.</i>

10:57.491 --> 11:00.592
<i>Or maybe their partners
just aren't good at listening.</i>

11:08.602 --> 11:10.735
You can't just
leave spaces blank.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.705
How am I supposed to know
her favorite childhood memory?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.607
Have you tried asking her?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.782
This is good.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.118
Thanks, babe.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.220
What's your favorite
childhood memory?

11:39.166 --> 11:42.901
<i> Some answers require</i>
<i>a little more legwork.</i>

11:42.936 --> 11:45.603
<i>I've found that if you really
wanna get to know someone,</i>

11:45.639 --> 11:47.439
<i>you should read
their favorite book.</i>

11:47.474 --> 11:48.540
<i>It says a lot.</i>

11:54.181 --> 11:57.449
<i>The questions don't always
have to be complicated,</i>

11:57.484 --> 12:00.351
<i>like number four. How do they
spend their downtime?</i>

12:00.387 --> 12:02.353
Ah. Hi.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.605
<i> The secret</i>
<i>to my business is...</i>

12:20.640 --> 12:22.774
<i>Well, there is no secret.</i>

12:22.809 --> 12:24.609
<i>It isn't a gift,
it's just a lot of research</i>

12:24.644 --> 12:26.144
<i>and understanding
that deep down,</i>

12:26.179 --> 12:28.646
<i>most of us want the same thing.</i>

12:42.696 --> 12:44.395
<i>Sometimes,
the simplest questions</i>

12:44.431 --> 12:46.631
<i>can lead
to the most profound answers...</i>

12:47.734 --> 12:50.368
<i>but not always.</i>

12:50.403 --> 12:54.172
<i>Of course, it does help to ask
the big questions</i>

12:54.207 --> 12:57.442
<i>to find out what inspires them,
what moves their world.</i>

12:59.079 --> 13:00.512
<i>This takes discretion.</i>

13:00.547 --> 13:02.046
<i>People aren't always honest,</i>

13:02.082 --> 13:03.548
<i>even with themselves,</i>

13:03.583 --> 13:07.018
<i>when faced
with questions like this.</i>

13:07.053 --> 13:10.421
<i>But if you really wanna know
what makes someone tick,</i>

13:10.457 --> 13:14.526
<i>you might only get the answer
by seeing it for yourself.</i>

13:14.561 --> 13:17.328
<i>Truth be told,
these questions might feel like</i>

13:17.364 --> 13:19.164
<i>they're impossible to answer,</i>

13:19.199 --> 13:22.367
<i>but with the right person,
they can be painfully obvious.</i>

13:36.049 --> 13:37.148
Hm.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.596
No, I am not giving up,
I'm saying it's impossible.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.798
- There is a difference.
<i>-  Come on, dude.</i>

13:53.834 --> 13:55.611
I thought you were supposed
to be good at this.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.102
I am good at this,
but the process takes time.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.737
And two weeks is not enough,

13:59.773 --> 14:02.407
<i>especially for someone
as interesting as Jenny.</i>

14:02.442 --> 14:04.943
Congratulations, by the way.
She's a winner.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.612
Much more difficult to figure
out than most of my clients.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.715
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm asking for help.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.261
<i> Come on, Tom,</i>
<i>you're not gonna let</i>

14:12.285 --> 14:14.319
one little speed bump
throw you off, right?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.120
But it can't be done,
I'd have to focus

14:16.156 --> 14:17.455
all of my attention on her

14:17.490 --> 14:18.768
to get the information
you're missing.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.291
That's a good idea.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.360
You'll figure it out
in no time.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.174
- Come over for dinner tomorrow.
- What?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.764
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- Why?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.766
So you can meet her.

14:28.802 --> 14:31.169
<i> Get the intel in person.</i>

14:38.812 --> 14:41.579
So, Tom, Paul tells me
you're a consultant.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.514
- He did?
- Y-yeah.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.984
Well, when I told Jenny
you were coming over for dinner,

14:46.019 --> 14:47.986
she asked what you do,
so I told her.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.754
Yeah, but Paul
didn't really elaborate.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.656
What sort of, uh, consulting
do you do?

14:51.691 --> 14:54.993
Uh, you know, um,

14:55.028 --> 14:58.796
finances and branding
and outreach.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.999
- The youzhe.
- Those all sound like buzzwords.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.668
- They do, don't they?
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.004
- What about event planning?
- Hm?

15:06.039 --> 15:08.006
Well, it seems you have
a wide array of contacts,

15:08.041 --> 15:11.209
given the breadth
of your expertise.

15:11.244 --> 15:15.213
Mm. Well...
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh, I-I...

15:15.248 --> 15:18.449
Yeah, I dabble in, uh,
event planning.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.451
- Really? That's perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.453
You're just the guy
I've been looking for.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.822
I'm gonna get some more wine.
You want some more wine?

15:24.858 --> 15:27.191
- You guys want some more wine?
- I would need...

15:27.227 --> 15:29.861
- Good.
- Yeah, I'd like some. Thank you.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.696
- What is she talking about?
- I don't know.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.464
I don't know anything
about event planning.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.033
Then why did you tell her
that you do?

15:35.068 --> 15:36.501
- Paul.
- So, Tom...

15:36.536 --> 15:38.369
I could really use your help

15:38.405 --> 15:39.871
if you're available.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.473
Oh, yeah, sure.
What exactly do you need?

15:42.509 --> 15:44.042
Well, I don't know
if Paul told you,

15:44.077 --> 15:46.844
but I actually run a non-profit.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.547
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The Family Shelter Network.

15:49.582 --> 15:53.551
Providing shelter and comfort
for families in need.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.720
Yeah!

15:55.755 --> 15:59.157
I-I saw that when I looked it up
on the Internet.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.659
Well, I still manage
the LA office remotely,

16:01.695 --> 16:05.196
but while I'm here, I figured
I'd explore the possibility

16:05.231 --> 16:07.265
of expanding a Chicago branch.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.334
So what better way
to spread the word

16:09.369 --> 16:11.002
than to throw
a big holiday benefit?

16:11.037 --> 16:13.604
- Uh-huh.
- And since I'm new to town...

16:13.640 --> 16:15.573
I could really use
some help planning.

16:15.608 --> 16:20.278
You know, finances,
branding, outreach?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.512
Those sorts of things.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.448
You want his help

16:23.483 --> 16:26.250
planning a charity benefit
for Christmas.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.920
Yes, that would be amazing.

16:28.955 --> 16:31.689
I know two weeks
is not that much time.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.225
Yeah, I-it's a little bit
short notice.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.861
But I think
that we could pull it off.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.564
- If you're interested.
- Uh...

16:39.599 --> 16:40.965
And as an added bonus,

16:41.001 --> 16:43.701
I would actually have
a friend in town,

16:43.737 --> 16:45.236
given the fact
that we'd have to spend

16:45.271 --> 16:46.604
pretty much every day together.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.579
- Um...
- I-I'm-I'm sorry.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.981
I didn't mean
to just dump all this on you.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.549
No, no, it's fine.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.218
I've known you, what,
20 minutes?

17:00.253 --> 17:02.164
And I'm already trying
to recruit you into my charity.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.788
- Don't worry about it.
- No, really.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.568
Forget I said anything.
Honestly, I, I can handle it.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.559
I just get a little carried away
sometimes.

17:10.663 --> 17:11.863
Oh.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.265
Say yes.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.237
You know what, I'd love to help.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.241
- Really?
- Sure. Sure.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.609
- How can I say no?
- Oh!

17:25.645 --> 17:27.678
Wow. Thank you.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.248
Yeah, Tom, thank you.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.583
- You're welcome, Paul.
- Hm.

17:32.619 --> 17:37.255
Well, given that we do not have
the luxury of time,

17:37.290 --> 17:38.856
when would you like to start?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.825
What's your day like tomorrow?

17:45.799 --> 17:47.732
Oh, this is gonna be great.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.744
I fail to see
how me getting another job

17:59.779 --> 18:02.647
with another Christmas deadline
is a positive.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.916
Dude, two birds, one stone.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.185
<i> You jab about the charity</i>
<i>and then suddenly</i>

18:07.220 --> 18:09.587
push the conversation
towards deepest desires.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.422
Plus, it's another paycheck,
so I'd say

18:11.458 --> 18:13.224
you're having
a pretty good holiday season.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.260
You and I have very differing
definitions of good.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.830
Well, here she is now.
I'll let you know how it goes.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.402
- Hey!
- Hey. Oh, wow!

18:24.437 --> 18:26.938
- We're, uh, hugging.
- Sorry I'm late.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.774
I walked by the Rookery Building
and I couldn't not go in.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.343
- Sure. Who could resist?
- I love this place.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.045
It's so quaint.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.047
Oh, what?

18:36.082 --> 18:38.950
Nothing. I had a client
who described it the same way.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.718
It's funny how different
a word can sound

18:40.753 --> 18:42.019
depending on who's saying it.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.455
- Right.
- Something to drink?

18:44.491 --> 18:46.858
What are the odds
they have an herbal tea?

18:46.893 --> 18:51.028
- Not a coffee drinker?
- No, I am. Well, was.

18:51.064 --> 18:53.364
Paul and I
usually avoid caffeine.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.766
The tea helps him unwind.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.035
Seems like
he needs to do that a lot.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.037
Yeah, you know,
he's tried everything.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.874
Massages, sleeping pills,
aroma therapy.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.709
Maybe he could try
a less stressful job.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.445
Yeah, try telling him that
and let me know how it goes.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.415
- Have you ever heard of ASMR?
- Mm-mm.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.252
It stands for Autonomous Sensory
Meridian Response.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.888
They're these weird, little
videos that help you relax.

19:16.923 --> 19:21.225
Like, people whispering,
water boiling, stuff like that.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.261
- Paul does this?
- Oh, can't sleep without it.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.631
Uh, what would you like?

19:27.700 --> 19:29.300
Hm.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.970
Wow! It has been a long time
since I've had caffeine.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.740
Well, Paul is not here,
so go crazy.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.176
All right.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.077
I guess I'll have
a black coffee.

19:40.113 --> 19:42.980
Whoa! Slow down there.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.950
Hey, Justin, could we have
one more black coffee, please?

19:45.985 --> 19:48.152
- Of course.
- Thanks, man.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.921
All right,
let's get down to business.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.356
The event's in two weeks,
so I think

19:51.391 --> 19:53.824
the most important part
is getting the venue.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.860
What are you thinking?

19:54.894 --> 19:55.993
I would like something

19:56.029 --> 19:57.139
with a lot of space, you know?

19:57.163 --> 19:59.197
I'm hoping for a good turnout.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.299
And I'd love something
with some history.

20:01.334 --> 20:05.036
So the pancake shack is out.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.449
Oh, and if we can get a staff
included, that would be amazing.

20:07.473 --> 20:08.851
That way we don't have to hire
extra help

20:08.875 --> 20:10.107
for serving and everything.

20:10.143 --> 20:12.009
- Staff.
- Oh, and a kitchen.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.511
For food preparation
and what not.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.557
- Thank you.
- Thanks, man.

20:14.581 --> 20:15.947
No problem.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.148
Hm.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.653
Mm. I forgot how good
coffee tastes.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.460
So, uh, the venue.

20:29.495 --> 20:30.528
To recap...

20:30.563 --> 20:32.863
Big space, lots of history,

20:32.899 --> 20:35.299
staff included, kitchen,

20:35.335 --> 20:37.835
and it needs to be available
in the next two weeks,

20:37.870 --> 20:40.004
during the busiest time
of the year.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.175
And affordable.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.744
- It's impossible.
- Actually...

20:46.779 --> 20:49.580
- I think I know a place.
- You're kidding?

20:49.616 --> 20:52.316
I'll make a call tonight
and see.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.751
Maybe we check it out tomorrow?

20:53.786 --> 20:55.987
That'd be amazing.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.655
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.767
How is everything there?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.242
<i> Oh, I've got it</i>
<i>locked down.</i>

21:11.271 --> 21:13.371
You should've put me in charge
a long time ago.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.839
<i>How about you?</i>

21:14.874 --> 21:16.607
Is Chicago
as magical as you remember?

21:16.643 --> 21:18.709
Yes, it is. It snowed today.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.078
<i>So I'm working
for a 8-year-old?</i>

21:21.114 --> 21:23.281
- Hey, did you get my e-mail?
<i>- I did.</i>

21:23.316 --> 21:25.016
Benefit's a good idea,
but you got

21:25.051 --> 21:26.350
enough bandwidth to manage it?

21:26.386 --> 21:27.585
Nope, but I think

21:27.620 --> 21:29.353
I found someone that can help.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.222
One of, uh,
Paul's fraternity brothers

21:31.257 --> 21:32.890
specializes
in this kind of thing.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.126
Ooh, a fraternity brother.
Is he cute?

21:35.161 --> 21:36.727
- Meg!
<i>- What?</i>

21:36.763 --> 21:38.396
I have a boyfriend, so do you.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.898
So? How's that relevant
to my question?

21:40.933 --> 21:43.934
- Yes, he's cute.
<i>- I knew it.</i>

21:43.970 --> 21:47.705
Doesn't matter because I'm only
using him for his expertise.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.242
- And his body.
- Okay, I'm hanging up now.

21:51.277 --> 21:52.755
<i>I'll talk to you soon.
Miss your face.</i>

21:52.779 --> 21:55.279
- All right, miss you more. Bye.
- Bye, babe.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.431
Wow! It's so...

22:13.466 --> 22:14.732
Quaint?

22:18.338 --> 22:21.739
Wow!
This place is amazing.

22:21.774 --> 22:25.443
Yeah.
It's almost like a museum.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.911
- Oh, I know.
- Beautiful.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.646
- Oh, here. I'll take that.
- Oh.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.082
Well,
Merry Christmas to me.

22:31.117 --> 22:34.118
Uh, hello, Victoria.
This is Jenny Stone.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.753
The friend
I told you about.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.755
It's a pleasure to meet you.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.457
This place is so beautiful.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.159
Yes, mother at least
has good taste.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.806
You know, Tom didn't give me
too many details,

22:43.830 --> 22:45.663
but I imagine
it should do the trick.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.665
Oh, it's perfect,
and thank you again

22:47.700 --> 22:49.300
for letting us
have the event here.

22:49.335 --> 22:52.937
Oh, any excuse to keep Thomas
under my thumb

22:52.972 --> 22:55.473
is worth the inconvenience.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.108
Why don't you tell Jenny here

22:57.143 --> 23:00.444
something about the history
of the house?

23:00.480 --> 23:03.781
Well, it was constructed
in 1870,

23:03.816 --> 23:06.717
but it's undergone
extensive renovation since then.

23:06.753 --> 23:10.388
And a year later,
it became local lore.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.990
1871? Wait.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.493
Are you telling me that
this place is somehow connected

23:15.528 --> 23:16.994
to the Great Chicago Fire?

23:17.029 --> 23:19.463
Some call it an urban legend.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.076
I assume you know
the origin of the fire.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.466
Yeah, Miss O'Leary's cow

23:22.502 --> 23:23.968
knocked over the lantern
in the barn.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.047
Well,
the barn is true enough,

23:25.071 --> 23:26.404
but the cow's absolute nonsense.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.406
The story goes,

23:28.441 --> 23:31.876
that the lady of the house,
Margaret,

23:31.911 --> 23:36.347
fell in love with
a poor cobbler's son, Nathaniel,

23:36.382 --> 23:39.517
but at her father's behest,
she was already engaged

23:39.552 --> 23:42.686
to the heir of
a prominent family, Alexander.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.255
Now, even though
Margaret was engaged,

23:44.290 --> 23:45.923
she was in love with Nathaniel

23:45.958 --> 23:47.703
and couldn't bear the thought
of being without him.

23:47.727 --> 23:51.195
So the two of them
would meet in secret

23:51.230 --> 23:53.030
at the O'Leary barn.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.598
In the weeks
leading up to the wedding,

23:54.634 --> 23:57.868
Alexander grew suspicious
of his future bride's

23:57.904 --> 23:59.703
nightly disappearances,

23:59.739 --> 24:01.605
and one night he followed her.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.873
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.186
He trailed her
to the barn and he

24:04.210 --> 24:05.910
found the two lovers embraced.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.012
Furious,
he pulled out his pistol

24:08.047 --> 24:09.547
and shot Nathaniel dead.

24:11.417 --> 24:14.185
Heartbroken, Margaret
flung a lantern at Alexander,

24:14.220 --> 24:15.286
starting a blaze.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.353
She locked the barn,

24:16.389 --> 24:17.688
sealing his fate,

24:17.723 --> 24:19.356
then raced home, threw a noose

24:19.392 --> 24:20.891
over the rafters of her barn

24:20.927 --> 24:23.360
and hanged herself.

24:25.331 --> 24:29.433
Wanting only to be reunited
with her lost love.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.569
If the tales are to be believed,

24:31.604 --> 24:34.438
the fires of her love and loss
were so strong,

24:34.474 --> 24:37.141
they engulfed the entire city
in flames,

24:37.176 --> 24:39.043
except for her home,

24:39.078 --> 24:41.645
which somehow
withstood the blaze.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.080
It's as they say,

24:43.115 --> 24:47.284
"Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned."

24:50.456 --> 24:54.291
Oh, that is the most romantic
story I've ever heard.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.660
Yes, no good romance is complete

24:56.696 --> 24:58.429
without murder
and mass destruction,

24:58.464 --> 25:00.664
but it makes
for a wonderful story

25:00.700 --> 25:02.900
for the beginning of a tour.
Shall we?

25:02.935 --> 25:04.969
Lead the way.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.171
Oh, uh...

25:07.206 --> 25:11.342
We have a fully-equipped kitchen
designed for entertaining

25:11.377 --> 25:15.179
and our chef
makes wonderful appetizers.

25:15.214 --> 25:19.250
Salmon puffs, chicken tarragon,
mushroom cappuccino.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.485
Wow, that all sounds amazing,

25:21.521 --> 25:24.622
but I was thinking
something a bit more basic.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.991
Yes. I imagined you would.

25:31.831 --> 25:32.997
Okay.

25:35.735 --> 25:36.834
Hm.

25:50.016 --> 25:53.217
And this is
played his violinre my fr

25:53.252 --> 25:55.152
through the years.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.688
And this is the ballroom.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.557
- It's perfect for a waltz.
- Oh.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.760
The Viennese Waltz
if you're feeling adventurous.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.106
- You wanna dance?
- Okay.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.330
Hm.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.973
Or whatever that is.

26:23.783 --> 26:27.184
That place
was incredible! And for free?

26:27.219 --> 26:28.719
How'd you manage
to pull that off?

26:28.754 --> 26:30.788
Oh, Victoria
is a very grateful client

26:30.823 --> 26:34.224
who may have
a bit of a crush on me.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.594
Yeah? I get it.

26:36.629 --> 26:37.962
I mean,
because you're so selfless

26:37.997 --> 26:40.965
and you get things done,
not because of...

26:41.000 --> 26:42.933
Wow, let's just
change the subject.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.603
I, um, I saw you writing
some stuff down back there.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.138
- Anything you wanna discuss?
- Oh? Uh, nah.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.609
Just minor details. I don't
wanna bore you with them.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.211
But we should talk about
some bigger-picture stuff.

26:54.246 --> 26:57.114
I'd love to wrap my head
around the charity

26:57.149 --> 27:00.451
so we can strategize
what the event might entail.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.097
Awesome. You wanna come inside
and talk about it?

27:02.121 --> 27:05.055
You can see
how my whole operation works.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.591
Now, these are
all the families we've helped.

27:07.627 --> 27:10.427
I like to keep them up to remind
me through the rough times

27:10.463 --> 27:12.596
that it's all worth it.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.731
Hm.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.968
Not a bad place to work.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.637
Yeah. Well, work and live.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.605
My apartment's
right upstairs.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.407
Ah, so you struggle

27:23.442 --> 27:25.843
with separating your personal
and professional life.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.611
- That's too bad.
- Oh.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.614
And your coworkers...
Ugh, they must drive you crazy.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.783
Oh, yeah. All, all one of 'em.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.352
Drive myself crazy.

27:35.388 --> 27:38.088
Now, I'm hoping the benefit's
gonna help with that.

27:38.124 --> 27:41.625
It must be tough leaving
your whole other life behind.

27:41.661 --> 27:45.029
Yeah, but you know,
it's only temporary.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.142
Well, I mean, there is a lot
of opportunity for growth

27:47.166 --> 27:49.099
here in Chicago,
but I'm just not sure

27:49.135 --> 27:51.468
how permanent my relocation is.

27:51.504 --> 27:54.271
Though it is really nice
being back.

27:54.306 --> 27:57.341
- Back?
- Oh, I'm from here.

27:57.376 --> 28:00.544
Yeah, my mom and I went to LA
when I was a kid.

28:00.579 --> 28:03.047
Yeah, and I missed it
every day since.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.382
- So you're a Chicago girl.
- Through and through.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.851
Yeah, you know,
being back here

28:07.887 --> 28:11.021
just feels right, you know?

28:11.057 --> 28:12.723
Like, I'm finally home.

28:12.758 --> 28:16.026
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm glad you're here.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.096
Maybe you'll find
some reason to stay.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.967
Yeah, you never know.
Maybe I will.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.974
So you have helped
all of these people?

28:31.010 --> 28:33.911
Yup, we've helped them, uh,
pay off homes,

28:33.946 --> 28:35.846
get jobs, buy groceries.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.816
I mean, really anything
we can do to help.

28:38.851 --> 28:41.452
Yeah. We've been lucky.

28:42.588 --> 28:43.721
Hm.

28:44.924 --> 28:45.989
What?

28:47.359 --> 28:50.394
Nothing, it's just that...

28:50.429 --> 28:53.130
you're doing
very important work.

28:55.534 --> 28:56.700
Thank you.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.852
You know what,
I should get out of your hair.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.576
You have put up with me
enough today.

29:05.611 --> 29:08.345
No. It's, it's been a great day.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.384
Hey,
you wanna come upstairs

29:14.420 --> 29:15.853
and have some hot chocolate?

29:15.888 --> 29:16.928
My way of saying thank you

29:16.956 --> 29:18.989
for everything that you've done.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.393
- Sure. Why not? Yeah.
- Okay.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.964
Mm. You know,
I just love Christmas.

29:26.999 --> 29:30.534
Families coming together,
hot cocoa.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.870
- The snow.
- Crackling fires.

29:34.673 --> 29:37.608
No other holiday
even compares in my book.

29:37.643 --> 29:38.742
I am with you there.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.577
It's just something

29:40.613 --> 29:42.212
so magical about it.

29:42.248 --> 29:45.949
Oh, and the music.
I just love Christmas music.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.585
Okay. All-time favorite
Christmas song. Go.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.488
Oh, that's easy. "Baby Won't You
Please Come Home?"

29:51.524 --> 29:53.001
Not really a Christmas song.
Go again.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.292
Oh, it was when my dad sang it,

29:55.327 --> 29:57.394
but he added "For Christmas"
to the end of it.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.796
Well, was your dad a musician?

29:58.831 --> 30:00.798
- Yeah, he was a blues musician.
- Really?

30:00.833 --> 30:02.733
Yeah, he wasn't famous,
but you know,

30:02.768 --> 30:05.435
he would play around here
in the Chicago blues clubs.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.574
I guess I'll always have
a soft spot for sad songs.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.277
Me, too. I grew up
on the Chicago blues.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.245
That's so cool that your dad
is a blues musician.

30:15.281 --> 30:18.982
Mm-hmm. Yeah, look.
I have a picture right here.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.018
Sorry.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.187
Here's him and his band.

30:23.222 --> 30:26.423
Robert Stone
And The Chicago Fire.

30:26.458 --> 30:27.958
That's my dad
in the middle.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.993
And that is Sam Baker.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.929
He was, like, my uncle,
growing up.

30:31.964 --> 30:35.699
Okay, hold on.
Who's that?

30:36.869 --> 30:39.069
- Is that you?
- Yes.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.106
Adorable.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.441
I'd love to listen to them.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.845
Oh, so would I.
You have no idea.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.479
Yeah, this was
pre-Internet days,

30:49.515 --> 30:51.949
so they only had
a few songs recorded.

30:51.984 --> 30:54.852
And I didn't buy their album
because I obviously didn't think

30:54.887 --> 30:56.420
I needed to.

30:58.524 --> 31:02.025
I haven't heard
my daddy's voice in...

31:02.061 --> 31:03.760
almost 20 years.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.198
Yeah, I was, I was eight

31:08.234 --> 31:10.567
when I started going
to the Chicago blues clubs

31:10.603 --> 31:12.402
and watching him play.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.005
And my mom hated it.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.840
My dad and my mom,
they loved each other,

31:16.876 --> 31:20.010
but they fought
like cats and dogs.

31:20.045 --> 31:24.147
One day, my mom just
couldn't take it anymore,

31:24.183 --> 31:25.482
so she packed up her stuff

31:25.517 --> 31:28.185
and on December 1st,

31:28.220 --> 31:30.420
we moved to LA.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.523
Started a new life.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.727
I get it now. "Baby Won't You
Please Come Home For Christmas?"

31:36.762 --> 31:40.998
It's about the love of his life
leaving him.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.366
You know,
he called her every day

31:42.401 --> 31:44.735
and sung that song to her.

31:44.770 --> 31:47.204
Drove my mom nuts, but I thought

31:47.239 --> 31:50.841
it was the most romantic thing.

31:50.876 --> 31:53.777
You know, we never came back
to Chicago,

31:53.812 --> 31:55.757
but a couple of years later,
my dad came and visited me

31:55.781 --> 31:56.781
on my birthday.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.053
And a week later,
he was killed in a car accident.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.590
I never got to say goodbye.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.527
I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.896
I have no idea
of why I just told you that.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.936
I'm glad you did.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.051
You know what,
I should get going.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.452
Yeah, of course.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.759
Uh, I guess...

32:42.795 --> 32:45.896
if you wanna meet up again,
just give me a call.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.164
Definitely.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.832
- Okay.
- We'll, we'll be in touch.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.167
Uh, uh, goodnight. Thank you.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.469
Goodnight.
Of course. My pleasure.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.004
- Have a nice night.
- You, too.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.305
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.507
Oh, what are you doing?

34:52.690 --> 34:53.889
Uh, coming!

34:55.159 --> 34:56.460
Coming!

34:58.530 --> 34:59.896
Coming!

35:04.770 --> 35:06.303
- What?
- Hi!

35:06.338 --> 35:07.904
I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?

35:07.940 --> 35:10.740
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.809
I'm sorry.
Paul gave me your address.

35:12.845 --> 35:15.085
- I tried calling you a bunch...
- No, no, no, it's okay.

35:15.114 --> 35:18.748
Just, just give me a second
to put a shirt on.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.283
Maybe some pants.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.619
Sorry about this.
Almost ready. Hold on.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.201
It's okay.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.459
All right.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.361
- Delivery!
- Hey.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.530
- Straight from Café Libertad.
- Thank you.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.465
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.601
You're awful chipper
this morning.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.103
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

35:40.139 --> 35:41.671
- In the morning?
- Ah.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.640
Are you a functioning adult?

35:47.146 --> 35:49.479
So I had a flurry of inspiration
last night

35:49.515 --> 35:51.314
and I couldn't wait
to share it with you.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.517
I came up with a theme.
Christmas.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.019
It's all about giving
and family and warmth.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.188
So why complicate things?

35:58.223 --> 36:00.490
Yeah, all the food
could be homemade favorites.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.859
Sugar cookies,
toffee and fudge.

36:02.895 --> 36:04.828
We can make gingerbread houses.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.863
- I think it's great.
- Right!

36:06.899 --> 36:08.543
So now that
we have a day and a theme,

36:08.567 --> 36:11.234
I'm gonna send out the invites
to the network.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.047
Now, we have less than a week
to make this happen,

36:13.071 --> 36:14.604
so we can't waste any time.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.741
- Do you have a pen?
- Hey!

36:17.776 --> 36:21.645
Uh...
Have I told you about the view?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.079
Tops in the city.

36:23.115 --> 36:24.314
The view from the back porch,

36:24.349 --> 36:26.082
it is really spectacular.

36:26.118 --> 36:28.418
Go ahead right up there,
over there on the porch.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.687
This time of morning
with the sun coming up...

36:30.722 --> 36:32.066
- Okay.
- You're really gonna love it.

36:32.090 --> 36:33.857
- Yeah.
- All right, there you go.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.392
Oh, wow!

36:35.427 --> 36:37.494
- You weren't kidding.
- Right?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.996
It's amazing out here.
Oh, my gosh!

36:40.032 --> 36:42.432
- Is that the Lincoln Park Zoo?
- Sure is.

36:42.467 --> 36:44.445
I used to go there
all the time when I was little.

36:44.469 --> 36:47.370
I wonder if it's changed much
in the last 20 years.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.105
- Tom?
- Hey-hey!

36:49.141 --> 36:51.007
What a zoo, right?

36:51.043 --> 36:54.377
You know, if you're into animals
and such.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.612
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.214
Yeah, I'm awesome. Why?

36:57.249 --> 36:59.716
I, I don't know,
you're just acting kinda...

36:59.751 --> 37:01.685
- Aloof? Cool?
- Like a freak.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.789
- Let's look at the plans, huh?
- Okay.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.857
Now, you did
this whole thing last night?

37:07.893 --> 37:09.726
Mm-hmm. And this morning.

37:09.761 --> 37:13.029
We have decoration ideas,
some gift suggestions,

37:13.065 --> 37:15.532
sample recipes,
gingerbread construction.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.767
Well, hold-hold on,
this is an article

37:17.803 --> 37:19.302
from <i> Architectural Digest.</i>

37:19.338 --> 37:21.049
Oh, yeah. I'm very thorough
with my research.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.540
I think
we both can agree on that.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.286
Well, this is gonna be
a whole lot of work

37:25.310 --> 37:27.911
and we don't have
a whole lot of time.

37:27.946 --> 37:28.946
Yep.

37:28.981 --> 37:29.991
I hope Victoria doesn't mind

37:30.015 --> 37:32.315
some free Christmas decorations.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.626
Um, all right, give me a ribbon.
Hit it.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.894
- All right.
- Hit it.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.396
Yeah!

37:46.431 --> 37:47.431
I'm lucky.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.589
Okay, let's do red.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.592
Or...

38:33.679 --> 38:34.679
Yeah.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.631
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Ah.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.700
- Hey!
- Paul?

38:58.904 --> 39:00.970
Hey!

39:01.006 --> 39:03.006
- Who is this?
- The boyfriend.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.575
- Wonderful.
- Hm.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.644
- The place looks great!
- Mm-hmm.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.923
What are you doing here?

39:08.947 --> 39:10.224
I thought
you were to work late...

39:10.248 --> 39:12.082
Yeah, I got out
earlier than expected.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.517
Figured I'd stop by, see how
things were coming along.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.686
- Well...
- Perfect timing. We're done.

39:16.722 --> 39:17.932
Yeah, well, you know me.

39:17.956 --> 39:18.988
Swoop in last minute,

39:19.024 --> 39:20.223
take all the glory.

39:21.927 --> 39:24.861
Hi, I'm Paul.
I don't think we've met before.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.330
Victoria Stolle. Delighted.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.499
We were just about
to sit down to dinner.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.067
Won't you join us?

39:31.103 --> 39:33.536
- Ah, I don't want to intrude.
- Oh, I insist.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.739
It'll be nice to have
another man around the house.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.907
I've been feeling
like a third wheel all day.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.715
Thanks.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.984
Wow, the food
is delicious. Mm...

39:48.820 --> 39:49.953
Remarkable.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.187
Only a year and you're moving

39:51.223 --> 39:53.223
across the country
to be together.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.926
Actually,
I'm not quite sure yet about...

39:56.962 --> 39:58.695
You must be very serious.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.076
Don't you
think so, Tom?

40:02.100 --> 40:03.100
Hm?

40:03.135 --> 40:04.200
Don't you think they make

40:04.236 --> 40:05.735
a lovely couple?

40:05.771 --> 40:07.404
Oh, yeah, yeah, she's great.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.806
Uh, they're great.
You guys are great.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.085
It's a shame
you don't have

40:11.109 --> 40:12.442
political aspirations.

40:12.477 --> 40:13.877
What a power couple.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.279
This is nice. Isn't this nice?

40:16.314 --> 40:17.514
Mm-hmm.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.050
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

40:21.086 --> 40:24.154
Victoria,
let me just say thank you

40:24.189 --> 40:26.456
for letting Jenny
host her charity thing here.

40:26.491 --> 40:30.226
- This place is incredible.
- Well, it's not mine yet.

40:30.262 --> 40:34.130
Jenny, this is the kind of house
I've been talking about.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.933
Really? I actually quite like
my apartment.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.435
No, your apartment
is great,

40:38.470 --> 40:40.181
but you can't raise five kids
in an apartment.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.606
I'm sorry, five kids?

40:43.642 --> 40:44.974
Oh, I agree.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.110
Yeah, five kids need a house.

40:47.145 --> 40:50.113
They need a house on land.
Family needs space.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.915
Uh, Jenny,
you have quite the catch here.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.784
I mean, a man with a plan
for your future together?

40:54.820 --> 40:57.587
- He's a keeper.
- Take a good look.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.456
This is what
we're working towards.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.325
Thanks again, Victoria.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.360
Tom, I'm sure we'll talk soon.

41:04.396 --> 41:05.695
I'll see you guys soon.

41:05.730 --> 41:06.963
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.672
Well...
Thank you for dinner.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.074
I should probably
be hitting the road, too.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.811
Do you wanna stay
for a nightcap?

41:21.847 --> 41:25.548
I told you, mother's out of town
and I could use the company.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.851
No, no, thank you. Rain check?

41:27.886 --> 41:30.954
Come on. Stay with me.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.156
You can stay the night
if you want.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.058
Pick whichever room
fits your mood.

41:35.093 --> 41:38.127
Mm-hmm. Goodnight, Victoria.

41:46.905 --> 41:49.939
That was awesome!

41:49.975 --> 41:52.909
I feel like I only saw
one wing of the house.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.544
And that was huge.

41:54.579 --> 41:57.247
Did you have fun? Babe?

41:59.518 --> 42:02.285
Jenny. What is it?

42:06.925 --> 42:09.492
Five kids? Really?

42:09.528 --> 42:11.828
Five kids?
Where'd that come from?

42:11.863 --> 42:13.663
I come
from a big family.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.999
I've always
kinda wanted five kids.

42:16.034 --> 42:20.236
That's totally fine, but talk
to me about it, personally,

42:20.272 --> 42:22.005
not in front of strangers.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.606
I didn't think
it was a big deal.

42:23.642 --> 42:26.075
It's not like
I want five kids tonight.

42:26.111 --> 42:28.344
I've never heard you
say this before.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.780
Look, I'm sorry.

42:30.815 --> 42:32.315
I didn't mean
to get carried away.

42:32.350 --> 42:34.551
I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

42:37.689 --> 42:39.188
Well, it's not all bad, right?

42:40.992 --> 42:43.293
Me thinking about our future?

42:43.328 --> 42:45.662
I just want you to know
that I am in this...

42:47.299 --> 42:48.631
a hundo percento.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.135
I've got big plans for us.

43:13.358 --> 43:14.902
You should have heard her
in the car.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.827
I mean, she-she's starting
to wriggle, man.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.329
L-like a worm.

43:20.398 --> 43:22.065
Really?

43:22.100 --> 43:25.234
Man, you, you gotta get
a grip on the situation.

43:25.270 --> 43:28.371
You, you can handle this
much better if you just

43:28.406 --> 43:33.476
stop doing... push-ups.

43:33.511 --> 43:35.845
<i>- Five kids?</i>
- I know, right?

43:35.880 --> 43:37.747
It's not the fact
that it's just five kids,

43:37.782 --> 43:40.383
it's the fact that he's talking
about kids at all.

43:40.418 --> 43:42.185
You know, and our future,
like...

43:42.220 --> 43:44.854
Is he gonna propose?
It's just crazy.

43:44.889 --> 43:47.156
I don't even know what to do
with this information.

43:47.192 --> 43:48.603
Well, at least,
he's talking about a future.

43:48.627 --> 43:50.193
I mean,
that's a good thing, right?

43:50.228 --> 43:51.427
Yeah, I guess so,

43:51.463 --> 43:53.329
but how's he
planning it without me?

43:53.365 --> 43:55.198
You know what I mean,
like, five kids?

43:55.233 --> 43:57.600
Man, I thought
women liked this stuff.

43:57.636 --> 44:01.004
Like, marriage and kids and...

44:02.707 --> 44:05.308
You know, a, a guy
who's thinking about the future.

44:06.878 --> 44:08.678
Some women do, sure.

44:08.713 --> 44:11.881
But are you sure
that Jenny's that kinda woman?

44:11.916 --> 44:15.418
I think I am,
but do I even want that?

44:15.453 --> 44:19.789
I mean, something just doesn't
really feel right, you know?

44:19.824 --> 44:22.925
Maybe you're just not ready
for that type of stuff with <i> him.</i>

44:22.961 --> 44:24.394
And what's that
supposed to mean?

44:24.429 --> 44:26.095
All I'm saying is
it's only been a year.

44:26.131 --> 44:27.708
Maybe you should
pump the brakes a minute.

44:27.732 --> 44:29.599
No, I don't need
to pump the brakes.

44:29.634 --> 44:31.868
I mean, I didn't hire you
to pump the brakes.

44:31.903 --> 44:33.936
What I need is the gift.

44:33.972 --> 44:35.816
<i>I'm just saying, maybe you need
to plan your future</i>

44:35.840 --> 44:38.307
<i>with somebody else.</i>

44:38.343 --> 44:41.210
<i>Somebody like Tom.</i>

44:41.246 --> 44:42.879
I... No, that's, that's crazy.

44:42.914 --> 44:44.747
- You're crazy.
- I'm just saying.

44:44.783 --> 44:47.583
<i> I've only known Tom</i>
<i>a whole week, okay?</i>

44:47.619 --> 44:50.219
And I've been with Paul,
who I'm still with, by the way,

44:50.255 --> 44:51.988
we've been together for a year,
you know,

44:52.023 --> 44:54.791
and you just, you don't just
throw that away over a crush.

44:54.826 --> 44:56.793
I moved to Chicago for him.

44:56.828 --> 45:00.897
Look, first of all,
you out in Chicago on business.

45:00.932 --> 45:03.566
<i>Second, you don't have a ring
on your finger.</i>

45:03.601 --> 45:06.302
- You free, honey.
- Your soul is not crushed.

45:06.337 --> 45:08.504
Yes, it is.

45:08.540 --> 45:12.075
- And my heart is dying.
- Stop being so dramatic.

45:12.110 --> 45:15.445
Worst-case scenario, you're both
just a little confused.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.780
I think you're right.
Yeah, I think you're right.

45:17.816 --> 45:20.249
I'm just over-thinking it all,
I think, you know?

45:20.285 --> 45:23.152
<i>I think you should just
take a minute, breathe it in,</i>

45:23.188 --> 45:25.988
<i>soak it all in, I'm sure
you'll be right as rain.</i>

45:26.024 --> 45:28.624
<i>And just, just take time,
you know?</i>

45:28.660 --> 45:30.660
Yeah, I guess you're right.

45:30.695 --> 45:32.195
Yeah, it's fine.

45:32.230 --> 45:34.964
Everything's fine, just...

45:34.999 --> 45:38.768
Do me a favor?
Help me smooth things over.

45:38.803 --> 45:41.471
You guys still have to plan
that event, right?

45:44.042 --> 45:45.486
- Mm-hmm.
- But is it wrong...

45:45.510 --> 45:47.543
that I look forward
to seeing him so much?

45:47.579 --> 45:49.378
- Of course not.
- Ugh!

45:49.414 --> 45:50.791
You know I want
what's best for you.

45:50.815 --> 45:52.148
- Right?
- Yeah.

45:52.183 --> 45:54.016
The question is,
what do you want?

45:54.052 --> 45:56.819
That's the thing, I don't know!
I don't know what I want.

45:56.855 --> 46:00.356
I don't know, I'm just
so confused right now,

46:00.391 --> 46:01.736
but I think maybe you're right,
you know.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.226
I need to just relax,

46:03.261 --> 46:05.361
and let the whole thing breathe

46:05.396 --> 46:07.063
and see what happens.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.731
Thanks, Meg.
You're the best.

46:08.767 --> 46:10.233
<i>- You're welcome, babe.</i>
- All right.

46:10.268 --> 46:12.135
- I'll talk to you soon.
<i>- All right, boss.</i>

46:12.170 --> 46:13.481
<i>- Talk to you soon.</i>
- Talk to you soon.

46:13.505 --> 46:15.071
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.673
You're welcome. That's what
big brothers do, huh?

46:17.709 --> 46:20.176
Mm-hmm.

46:20.211 --> 46:22.478
Tau Sig?

46:22.514 --> 46:24.981
That's the only T-shirt
you own, isn't it?

46:25.016 --> 46:27.416
I think it's good
to be prepared.

46:27.452 --> 46:28.718
Unh-unh.

46:28.753 --> 46:29.986
Won't be left here.

46:30.021 --> 46:31.265
- Come get it.
- But-but... Okay.

46:31.289 --> 46:32.722
There it is. Bam!

46:33.958 --> 46:35.224
All right.

46:35.260 --> 46:37.894
Now, call my girlfriend

46:37.929 --> 46:41.731
and do whatever it takes
to get what we need.

46:55.947 --> 46:58.381
Hey, I am so happy
you called me.

46:58.416 --> 47:02.018
Seriously, I was going crazy
holed up in my office.

47:02.053 --> 47:03.920
This is exactly what I needed.

47:03.955 --> 47:05.888
No, it's my pleasure.

47:05.924 --> 47:08.858
Actually, it turned out
to be a very nice day.

47:08.893 --> 47:11.561
Yeah. You know, I can't believe
this record store is still here.

47:11.596 --> 47:13.029
I used to come here
all the time.

47:13.064 --> 47:15.131
This is the best record store
in Chicago.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.766
Same family's owned it
for generations.

47:16.801 --> 47:19.802
If anyone can find
a Robert Stone album,

47:19.838 --> 47:21.037
it's these guys.

47:23.308 --> 47:26.642
You have tried to find it
before, haven't you?

47:26.678 --> 47:28.811
You know, I have,
but it was, like, a year ago,

47:28.847 --> 47:31.981
and I didn't have any luck,
so I figured it was a sign.

47:32.016 --> 47:35.117
Well, your luck
may be about to change.

47:35.153 --> 47:37.220
- Hey, Rosie. How are you?
- Hey.

47:37.255 --> 47:39.889
Uh, we could use some help
finding a blues album.

47:39.924 --> 47:41.457
Sure. What do you need?

47:41.492 --> 47:44.093
You know, if it's the blues,
Tom, we can find it.

47:44.128 --> 47:46.629
My friend here's father
used to play in a local band,

47:46.664 --> 47:48.297
and legend has it,
they cut an album.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.233
Oh, yeah? They got a name?

47:50.268 --> 47:52.079
Yeah, but I doubt
you would have heard of them.

47:52.103 --> 47:53.502
You never know until you try.

47:53.538 --> 47:54.971
Okay.

47:55.006 --> 47:58.341
Robert Stone
And The Chicago Fire?

47:58.376 --> 48:00.142
- Sorry, never heard of 'em.
- Told you.

48:00.178 --> 48:03.479
But you could find it, right?

48:03.514 --> 48:05.915
- Robert Stone And...
- The Chicago Fire.

48:05.950 --> 48:07.283
Chicago Fire.

48:07.318 --> 48:08.696
All right, let me see
what I can do.

48:08.720 --> 48:10.519
Thank you,
I really appreciate it, but...

48:10.555 --> 48:12.255
I don't think
you're gonna find anything.

48:12.290 --> 48:14.357
Well, I got a lot of friends
in this town.

48:14.392 --> 48:16.492
Don't give up on me quite yet.

48:16.527 --> 48:18.127
Well, I have faith in you,
Rosie.

48:18.162 --> 48:19.373
Give me call if you find
something, okay?

48:19.397 --> 48:20.463
- Okay, Tom.
- Thanks.

48:20.498 --> 48:22.531
- All right.
- Thank you.

48:32.410 --> 48:34.810
Oh, I just love
this place.

48:34.846 --> 48:37.313
You know, this was one
of my favorite spots growing up.

48:37.348 --> 48:38.948
So many memories.

48:38.983 --> 48:41.717
My father and I used to walk
this walk every Sunday

48:41.753 --> 48:42.897
on the way to the record store.

48:42.921 --> 48:45.021
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:46.691 --> 48:48.524
Oh, would you look at this?

48:48.559 --> 48:50.259
This is so pretty.

48:51.930 --> 48:53.707
You really haven't
been here in a while.

48:53.731 --> 48:56.065
They put this up, like,
seven, eight years ago.

48:56.100 --> 48:57.533
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.568
Hmm.

49:11.082 --> 49:12.915
- What?
- Nothing.

49:12.951 --> 49:16.485
Just... Paul has to work late.
Again.

49:16.521 --> 49:19.088
Boy, that guy must
really love his job.

49:19.123 --> 49:22.191
Yeah, sometimes
I feel jealous of it.

49:22.226 --> 49:24.827
You know, we were supposed to do
a walking pizza tour tonight.

49:24.862 --> 49:27.163
This is the third time
he's canceled this week.

49:29.467 --> 49:32.835
Well... I'm available.

49:34.238 --> 49:35.604
I was gonna walk you home
anyway.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.606
Might as well do it
with pizza, right?

50:19.917 --> 50:22.118
I still can't believe
you like Pizano's

50:22.153 --> 50:24.164
- ...more than Lou Malnati's.
- Oh, that's not what I said.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.022
What I said was that
I'm still savoring it.

50:26.057 --> 50:27.701
And, besides, you don't have
the leg to stand on here

50:27.725 --> 50:29.392
because your palate
has been corrupted

50:29.427 --> 50:32.461
by what passes
for pizza in LA.

50:32.497 --> 50:34.964
And I've still got Pequod's
on my mind.

50:34.999 --> 50:38.000
- Wait, do we have Pequod's?
- Ooh, we will next time.

50:38.036 --> 50:41.203
And that tour
will include Tavern Crust.

50:41.239 --> 50:43.406
Okay, you know, that's like
a dream come true for me.

50:43.441 --> 50:45.274
Do not mess with my heart.

50:46.878 --> 50:48.511
You really love it here,
don't you?

50:48.546 --> 50:51.514
Yeah, I really do.

50:51.549 --> 50:53.883
I wish I had
never moved.

50:53.918 --> 50:56.719
And today was like
being 12 again.

50:56.754 --> 50:59.055
We did all the things
that I love.

50:59.090 --> 51:01.090
The music, the food,

51:01.125 --> 51:04.693
the history... the people.

51:04.729 --> 51:07.563
- Hey, hey.
- I'm sorry.

51:07.598 --> 51:09.331
No, it's okay.

51:09.367 --> 51:10.677
It's just,
today was the kinda day

51:10.701 --> 51:12.468
that I used to have with my dad.

51:13.971 --> 51:16.939
For the first time in years,
I felt like...

51:16.974 --> 51:19.408
he was with me again.

51:19.444 --> 51:21.010
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm sure

51:21.045 --> 51:23.245
he'd be extremely proud
of the woman you've become.

51:23.281 --> 51:24.613
I don't know about that.

51:24.649 --> 51:26.916
No, I'm serious.

51:26.951 --> 51:29.618
You're the most amazing person
I've ever met.

51:29.654 --> 51:32.321
You give everything
and expect nothing in return.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.202
You're not afraid
to follow your heart

51:35.226 --> 51:37.560
no matter
where it takes you, and...

51:37.595 --> 51:39.428
most people don't have a shred

51:39.464 --> 51:42.098
of that kind of courage
and passion.

51:49.941 --> 51:53.576
We, we shouldn't be
doing this, I'm...

51:53.611 --> 51:56.078
I'm, I'm with Paul.

51:56.114 --> 51:57.413
I'm sorry.

53:28.873 --> 53:30.206
Open up!

53:33.511 --> 53:35.644
- Paul?
- Come on, it's me.

53:40.851 --> 53:44.253
Hey, man, you okay?
You seem... anxious.

53:44.288 --> 53:47.756
Yeah, you-you could say
I'm anxious.

53:47.792 --> 53:51.227
Okay, but first of all, Paul...
it's not what you think.

53:51.262 --> 53:53.762
Yeah. Yeah, of course
it's not what I think.

53:53.798 --> 53:55.831
I don't know what it is.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.533
Look, I can't wait any longer.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.168
Tom, I need the gift.

53:59.203 --> 54:02.171
Tell me you have something.

54:02.206 --> 54:04.006
So, this is about the gift?

54:04.041 --> 54:06.942
Yes.

54:06.978 --> 54:09.878
So, come on, tell me.
Do you know what it is yet?

54:09.914 --> 54:13.349
Uh... um, no.

54:13.384 --> 54:14.950
- Not yet.
- Oh, God, this is not good.

54:14.986 --> 54:17.019
This is not good.

54:17.054 --> 54:21.257
Jenny has been distant lately.

54:21.292 --> 54:23.425
I don't know.
I'm, I'm, I'm desperate.

54:23.461 --> 54:26.262
And may have done something
a little impulsive.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.567
- Paul, that's...
- Huge, I know.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.636
Cost a fortune.
I don't know.

54:33.671 --> 54:35.971
I just think
maybe this is what I need

54:36.007 --> 54:37.940
to really seal the deal.

54:37.975 --> 54:41.977
And if there's any doubt
about her saying yes,

54:42.013 --> 54:45.948
your gift will lay them to rest
once we've sprung it on her.

54:45.983 --> 54:47.449
Right?

54:49.520 --> 54:50.520
Tom?

54:52.657 --> 54:55.090
Tom, you okay there?

54:55.126 --> 54:57.559
Actually, no.

54:57.595 --> 54:59.115
I don't think that
this is a good idea.

55:03.100 --> 55:04.678
Hey, I'm sure
the gift is gonna be great.

55:04.702 --> 55:05.934
You're Mr. Christmas.

55:05.970 --> 55:07.469
No, I mean...

55:07.505 --> 55:10.139
I don't think
I should help you do this.

55:10.174 --> 55:12.775
- What?
- Doesn't this feel wrong to you?

55:12.810 --> 55:14.643
I don't wanna trick Jenny

55:14.679 --> 55:16.245
- ...into marrying you.
- What?

55:16.280 --> 55:18.180
That's exactly what we're
doing, we are pushing

55:18.215 --> 55:19.593
all the right buttons
to make her feel

55:19.617 --> 55:20.783
like you really know her,

55:20.818 --> 55:22.151
but you don't.

55:22.186 --> 55:23.786
Of course I know her.

55:23.821 --> 55:26.322
Oh, really?
What's her favorite song?

55:26.357 --> 55:28.090
Easy.
"Don't Stop Believing." Journey.

55:28.125 --> 55:29.958
No, that's nobody's
favorite song.

55:29.994 --> 55:31.994
That's your favorite song.

55:32.029 --> 55:35.130
God! I can't believe I did this!

55:35.166 --> 55:37.633
- Do I do this to all my clients?
- No! No, no, no.

55:37.668 --> 55:40.002
No, no, you help them.
Just like you're helping me.

55:40.037 --> 55:43.639
- This is your job.
- Not anymore. I quit.

55:43.674 --> 55:45.307
Where is this coming from?

55:45.343 --> 55:47.776
I don't know
her favorite song, big deal.

55:47.812 --> 55:49.712
She deserves better, Paul.

55:49.747 --> 55:51.413
Why do you care?

56:05.329 --> 56:07.963
I am sorry.

56:07.998 --> 56:10.132
I did not mean for this
to happen, but the more time

56:10.167 --> 56:11.812
I spent with her,
the more I got to know her,

56:11.836 --> 56:13.502
the more I have feelings
for her.

56:13.537 --> 56:16.138
Did, did something happen
between you?

56:20.077 --> 56:21.810
- You kissed?
- Yes!

56:21.846 --> 56:24.146
I don't even know
how it happened.

56:24.181 --> 56:25.692
You know, we were walking
through the city,

56:25.716 --> 56:27.983
and... it was reminding me
of when I was a kid,

56:28.018 --> 56:30.352
and I started talking
about my dad, and...

56:30.388 --> 56:32.588
And then it started snowing.

56:32.623 --> 56:33.756
<i>Perfect storm.</i>

56:33.791 --> 56:35.891
I know, and then...

56:35.926 --> 56:39.528
you know, he just, he said all
of these amazing things to me

56:39.563 --> 56:41.997
that nobody ever says,

56:42.032 --> 56:44.500
and then, I just, I gave in.

56:46.036 --> 56:48.170
So, how was it?

56:48.205 --> 56:51.440
Oh, it was perfect,
and awful

56:51.475 --> 56:55.010
and magical,
and horribly guilt-inducing,

56:55.045 --> 56:57.713
and really all of these whole
range of competing emotions

56:57.748 --> 57:00.916
<i>packed into
one single, wonderful</i>

57:00.951 --> 57:03.218
terrible moment.

57:03.254 --> 57:04.720
Ugh, I can't believe I did that.

57:04.755 --> 57:07.222
Wow, Jenny, that's some kiss.

57:07.258 --> 57:09.725
I know. I don't know what to do.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.060
Have you told Paul?

57:14.765 --> 57:16.732
No. I haven't.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.300
<i>Are you going to?</i>

57:18.335 --> 57:21.136
Of course, I have to tell him,
I just...

57:21.172 --> 57:22.771
I don't know what to say.

57:22.807 --> 57:25.541
He's called me, like, six times,

57:25.576 --> 57:27.876
and I keep ignoring it,
'cause I don't wanna lie to him.

57:27.912 --> 57:29.645
I just...

57:29.680 --> 57:31.980
I'm pretty much
the worst person ever.

57:32.016 --> 57:33.415
No, you're not.

57:33.451 --> 57:34.661
You're one of the best person
I know.

57:34.685 --> 57:36.652
You just
in a complicated situation.

57:36.687 --> 57:38.320
Yeah, you could say that again.

57:38.355 --> 57:40.422
When's the next time
you see Tom?

57:40.458 --> 57:43.292
The event's in three days,
so definitely by then.

57:43.327 --> 57:45.093
Okay, well, you've got
the next three days

57:45.129 --> 57:46.306
to figure out
the rest of your life.

57:48.599 --> 57:50.933
Thanks, Meg. You're the best.

57:50.968 --> 57:53.502
<i>Look, whatever you decide,
I know you'll make</i>

57:53.537 --> 57:55.504
the right decision.
I love you.

57:55.539 --> 57:58.574
I love you more.
I'll talk to you soon.

57:58.609 --> 58:00.242
<i> I'll talk to you later,</i>
<i>babe.</i>

58:00.277 --> 58:01.310
Bye.

58:12.490 --> 58:13.789
Oh...

58:23.968 --> 58:26.068
ng]

58:39.750 --> 58:43.685
I, uh... tried calling you.

58:43.721 --> 58:46.288
I know. I'm sorry. I...

58:46.323 --> 58:48.290
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.627
Yeah. We, we do.

58:51.662 --> 58:55.831
I don't know... what's happened

58:55.866 --> 58:58.233
the past couple of weeks.

58:58.269 --> 59:00.636
Past couple of months, really.

59:02.206 --> 59:06.241
We've been... off.

59:06.277 --> 59:09.077
- Paul...
- But...

59:09.113 --> 59:10.312
I want to fix it.

59:12.616 --> 59:15.784
Smooth things over
once and for all.

59:17.388 --> 59:18.687
Jenny...

59:21.792 --> 59:23.158
will you marry me?

59:36.240 --> 59:37.372
Um...

59:38.609 --> 59:39.808
Is this shock?

59:44.982 --> 59:46.415
Okay. What's happening?

59:48.252 --> 59:50.686
Paul...

59:54.291 --> 59:56.758
Paul, I can't marry you.

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:03.198
Yeah.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:08.203
I thought it was probably
a long shot,

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:11.673
but... can't blame a guy
for trying.

01:00:13.344 --> 01:00:15.911
Look, what happened between us

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:20.048
was nothing more
than two people realizing

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:22.517
they're just not right together.

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:29.124
I held on too tight
and I messed it up.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:31.960
We both held on too tight.

01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:34.096
And sooner or later,

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.198
we would've realized
the same thing.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:40.002
It's more than that.

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:41.236
Isn't it?

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.140
There's Tom.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:49.645
I saw him earlier,

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.079
and he told me what happened.

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:53.949
Oh, Paul, I am so sorry.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.651
Okay, this is all my fault.

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:57.886
Please don't blame him
for any of this.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.356
I'm sorry if I pushed you

01:01:01.392 --> 01:01:03.925
to move to Chicago.

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:05.961
Don't be.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.296
I really do love this place.

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:09.731
I know.

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:12.567
And I'm glad.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.945
Hey.

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:25.981
What's your favorite song?

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.884
"Baby Won't You
Please Come Home?"

01:01:28.919 --> 01:01:30.619
Yeah.

01:01:30.654 --> 01:01:31.920
I was way off.

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:36.491
Maybe I'll give it a listen.

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:14.174
Oh, can you put that
in the library for me?

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.565
Thank you.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.001
- Quite the circus today.
- Yeah, I'm sorry. It's a lot.

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:21.770
Oh, please.
I signed up for this.

01:02:21.805 --> 01:02:24.439
It's the price we pay for
being such incredible people.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:28.210
Where's Tom skulking about?

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.411
You know, I don't know.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:30.746
He was supposed to meet me here,

01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:33.181
but I haven't seen him.

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:36.384
What's wrong?

01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:39.888
Paul and I broke up.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.190
Oh. That's awful.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:44.025
Yeah.

01:02:44.061 --> 01:02:46.695
I'm sorry.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:49.030
Although, I have to say,
I'm not surprised.

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.734
- What?
- Oh, you know.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.804
The whole Tom thing.
He should've known better.

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:59.374
I'm honestly shocked the whole
thing didn't blow up sooner.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:01.543
Victoria, what are you
talking about?

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.981
You do know what he does
for a living, don't you?

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:08.583
Yeah, he coordinates events,
and...

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:24.866
Hey.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:29.738
Uh... I'm sorry.

01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:31.573
I know I should've called you,
but I thought

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.208
maybe you'd want some space.

01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:37.512
Is everything okay
with the venue?

01:03:37.548 --> 01:03:38.548
Mr. Christmas?

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:42.651
So Victoria was
telling the truth.

01:03:42.686 --> 01:03:44.820
- Jenny...
- Now, you need to tell me...

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:46.955
everything.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.257
- I was going to, I promise.
- When?

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:54.129
Let's not do this here,
and it's probably better

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.164
if I show you.

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:07.375
You've been researching me?

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:10.812
It's what I do.
I told Paul this was a bad...

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:13.548
Don't blame this on Paul.

01:04:13.584 --> 01:04:15.550
God, I'm such an idiot.

01:04:15.586 --> 01:04:17.953
This whole time
you've just been studying me?

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.487
No.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.990
I mean... yes.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.992
It started out that way, but...

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:25.861
So, all the questions
you've been asking me,

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.996
getting me to open up...

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.432
I thought it was 'cause you
were actually interested in me.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:34.669
- Was any of it even any real?
- Yes.

01:04:34.705 --> 01:04:36.872
So what you do,
you just...

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:39.374
lie to people?
Play with their feelings?

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:41.843
- I try to help people.
- How?

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:43.712
By finding out
what they care about,

01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:46.181
and then exploiting it?

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:47.883
What about when these people
figure out

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:50.518
that this heartfelt
personal gift

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.020
that meant everything to them

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.422
was given to them
by a stranger?

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:56.191
It's not exploitation.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.859
If you wanna
really connect with someone,

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.405
you have to know
what's important to them,

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:02.564
what makes their world turn.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:05.767
All I do for my clients is help
them realize what that is

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:07.135
for the people they care about.

01:05:08.739 --> 01:05:10.672
And then you make them
fall in love with you.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.143
It's okay, I'm over it now.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.514
You know what, don't even bother
coming to the event.

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:21.850
I have everything handled.

01:05:21.885 --> 01:05:23.952
Jenny, can we talk
about this, please?

01:05:23.987 --> 01:05:26.087
There's nothing left
to talk about.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:10.692
Oh, hey, Paul...

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.361
I'm not...

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:18.600
What happened?

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.935
You look awful.

01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:22.537
Thanks.

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.911
I... proposed to Jenny.

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.250
She said no.

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:38.586
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, it sucks.

01:07:38.622 --> 01:07:41.022
Basically, run a marathon,

01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:42.957
and try to not freak out
about it,

01:07:42.993 --> 01:07:45.226
which is kinda awesome, but...

01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:52.301
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:07:55.372 --> 01:07:57.705
Jenny found out...

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.040
what we were doing,

01:07:59.076 --> 01:08:02.877
and she hates me right now.

01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:04.512
Oh.

01:08:13.723 --> 01:08:15.190
Man...

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:19.993
We're kinda pathetic.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.663
Yep.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:25.466
<i>Let's just say there's
plenty fish in the sea.</i>

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:27.569
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.737
<i>Hug it. Yeah. Hug it out.</i>

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:32.073
<i>You'll be fine. Hug it out.</i>

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:33.508
<i>Come on, it's okay.</i>

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.009
<i>I'm here for you. It's okay.</i>

01:08:35.045 --> 01:08:36.211
Okay.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.380
Look, man, I was planning

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:40.747
on drowning my sorrows tonight,

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.383
and if you would like
to join me,

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:44.352
you'd be more than welcome.

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:47.455
You know, misery,
company, et cetera.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.926
Dude, you're the only person
in Chicago I know

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.395
that I haven't dated
or worked with,

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:58.032
so my options are limited.

01:08:58.068 --> 01:09:00.502
<i>- Yeah, you'll be fine.</i>
- Unh-unh.

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:02.703
<i>It's okay. I'm here for you.</i>

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.538
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.674
<i>I love you.</i>

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:08.343
I love you, too.

01:09:10.947 --> 01:09:14.149
It's not like you can say "No."
This is really nice of me.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:20.287
I guess it beats
being alone on Christmas.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:21.689
Tau Sig?

01:09:24.895 --> 01:09:26.327
Tau Sig.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.268
I really gotta keep
my heart rate up though, so...

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:22.951
You know, I really think
you just helped her realize

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:25.053
how wrong we were
for each other.

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:28.256
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:30.992
I'm pretty sure
she will never talk to me again.

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:34.128
It doesn't.

01:10:34.164 --> 01:10:36.130
It actually makes me feel
kinda terrible.

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:43.004
Look, I mean, I'm still
getting over the fact

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:45.473
that Jenny and I
aren't right for each other

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:47.909
but... well, it hurts.

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:52.280
It's the truth.

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:54.716
You and Jenny...

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:58.853
Like, why do we all have to be
miserable and alone?

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:01.189
Look, dude, if she winds up
with someone else...

01:11:04.227 --> 01:11:07.862
I just can't think of a single
person in the whole world

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:09.664
that would treat her better.

01:11:21.745 --> 01:11:24.045
- So, what's the plan?
- Plan?

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.313
To get her back.

01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:28.516
No, no, no, no, no, the plan...

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:30.985
is to just move on.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.820
- Yeah, it's stupid, dude.
- Hm...

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:35.723
We both know you're not gonna
get over her.

01:11:41.031 --> 01:11:42.897
Hey, when is that event?

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:47.468

Oh, fruit doll.
I love it.

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:01.008
You have to think of a name.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:02.744
I'll come back to check.

01:13:06.116 --> 01:13:07.615

01:13:22.332 --> 01:13:24.799
Well, I will admit,
you know how to throw an event.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:26.934
Usually, these things
are so stuffy.

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:30.104
Thank you. I'm really happy
with the way it turned out.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.206
Yes. Everyone seems very happy.

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:35.376
Well, not everyone.

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:39.447
I think we both know that
I had a kind of crush on Tom.

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:41.616
I mean, who wouldn't?
He's handsome.

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:43.518
And charming and thoughtful.

01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:45.520
- Don't forget deceitful.
- Who isn't?

01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:49.490
Look, I'm usually
not one to concede,

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:52.460
but I'm not a monster,

01:13:52.495 --> 01:13:54.162
and I'm not gonna
stand between two people

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:57.799
who are so clearly
crazy for each other.

01:13:57.834 --> 01:14:00.234
And I know you think that
what I said is a bad thing,

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:03.838
but... Tom does more good
with his talent

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:05.139
than you give him credit.

01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:07.875
Tom lied to me, Victoria.

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:09.911
I told him things
I don't tell anybody,

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:12.046
because I thought he cared.

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:13.714
Turns out he was just using it.

01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:16.851
But what if he does care?

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.857
I'm gonna go address the guests.
Excuse me.

01:14:33.603 --> 01:14:36.204
If I can get
everyone's attention, please.

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:38.506
I'm not normally good
at speaking in front of crowds,

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:40.074
so bear with me.

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:43.244
I just want to thank you all
for coming this evening

01:14:43.279 --> 01:14:46.914
to help raise awareness
for the Family Shelter Network.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:51.085
It is our goal to open
a branch out here in Chicago.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.522
It's because of charitable
donors like yourselves

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:57.592
that we are able
to help families in need.

01:14:57.627 --> 01:15:00.428
Families like we all have,

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:04.098
but these just need an extra
shoulder to lean on sometimes.

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:08.269
So, with your help,
the money and awareness we raise

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:10.938
can help shelter
and nurture families

01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:13.007
that need us the most.

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:17.178
Thank you.

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:17.104

Jen, you better take good care
of that record.

01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:05.987
It's signed by one
of the greatest blues musicians

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:07.722
I've ever met in my life.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:10.491
Oh, and, uh...

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:12.893
you might wanna take
good care of this, too.

01:17:12.929 --> 01:17:15.596
Your daddy gave it to me
20 years ago.

01:17:15.632 --> 01:17:19.233
He asked me to hold on to it
while he was away.

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:21.035
I think he'd like
you to have it.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:31.246
How did you...

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.424
Rosie and I made a whole bunch

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:33.948
of calls.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:36.450
It turns out Robert Stone
And The Chicago Fire

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:38.219
did make an album.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:41.088
And we found a seller,
and he had a copy.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.327
Jenny...

01:17:47.597 --> 01:17:50.231
I never meant to hurt you.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:52.033
I know you might think
that this is just some

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:53.734
kind of trick
to win you over,

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:56.270
it's not.

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:59.173
The past couple of weeks,
I have gotten to know you...

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:02.677
and I have fallen in love
with you.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:09.316
And maybe I'm crazy,
maybe it's all in my head,

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:12.420
but if you feel even a fraction
of what I'm feeling,

01:18:12.455 --> 01:18:14.789
then I'm not gonna give up.

01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:18.059
I'll play that song
in front of your office

01:18:18.094 --> 01:18:21.796
every day of every December
for the rest of my life

01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:24.065
begging for another chance.

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:27.401
So what do you say?

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:10.311
That is the best Christmas gift

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:12.713
I've ever gotten.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.715
You just wait till next year.

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:18.886
That is, of course,

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.021
if you've decided to stay.

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:22.990
You think I would
leave all this behind?

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:24.859
Not a chance.

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:41.375
You've discovered my vice.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.548
You over the party already?

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:50.151
Yeah, I've reached my limit.

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:53.754
People enjoying themselves
too much stresses me out.

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:56.524
- Hence, sugar.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:00.694
Of course, now I won't be able
to sleep tonight, so...

01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:09.336
Have you heard of... ASMR?

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:19.013
<i> On December 23rd,</i>
<i>at precisely 9:17 p.m.,</i>

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:21.515
<i>two snowflakes,
completely unique</i>

01:20:21.551 --> 01:20:23.884
<i>yet perfectly complementing
one another</i>

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.987
<i>fall in unison as they
head toward the Gold Coast.</i>

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:31.392
<i>Louis and Christina Selter
spot them</i>

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:33.427
<i>while stargazing with Matthew,</i>

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:35.930
<i>commenting on how snowflakes
are so much more</i>

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:37.731
<i>than just clumps of ice.</i>

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:42.870
<i>In Westtown,
Martin and Clara Hamilton</i>

01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:44.939
<i>make plans to celebrate
Christmas together</i>

01:20:44.974 --> 01:20:47.141
<i>for the first time
in ten years.</i>

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.943
<i>From that day forward,</i>

01:20:48.978 --> 01:20:51.212
<i>they never spend
a single day apart.</i>

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:56.617
<i>In Lincoln Park Theater,
Edith and Irv Struit</i>

01:20:56.652 --> 01:21:00.588
<i>reaffirm the vows they made
to each other 50 years ago,</i>

01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:02.790
<i>and make plans for their 75th.</i>

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:09.396
<i>In a mansion in the Gold Coast,
Paul Welch and Victoria Stolle</i>

01:21:09.432 --> 01:21:11.966
<i>share a moment of serenity.</i>

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:14.268
<i>And in that moment,
they realize</i>

01:21:14.303 --> 01:21:17.471
<i>even the simplest pleasures
can be the most profound...</i>

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:20.274
This is my favorite part.

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:23.110
<i> ...if you have someone</i>
<i>to share them with.</i>

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:33.287
<i>And as the pair of snowflakes
land on the window</i>

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:35.356
<i>of a house in West Chicago,</i>

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.725
<i>Tom Jacobs and Jenny Stone
smile.</i>

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:42.830
<i>While it might seem
impossible to answer,</i>

01:21:42.865 --> 01:21:44.765
<i>they both wonder
if they've found the person</i>

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.101
<i>they're meant to spend
the rest of their life with.</i>

01:21:48.704 --> 01:21:50.704
<i>But they don't wonder too much,</i>

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.606
<i>because with the right person,</i>

01:21:52.642 --> 01:21:54.441
<i>it's painfully obvious.</i>
