00:02.069 --> 00:04.136

memories in my head, i know it.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.206

no, i'm jace corso.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.658
[three]
i promise i will not rest

00:08.659 --> 00:10.109
Until i've done
everything i can to save you.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.861
[wendy]
i'm programed with various

00:11.862 --> 00:13.612
Recreational subroutines,
do you like fun?

00:13.614 --> 00:14.780
[three] ugh. Wait!

00:14.782 --> 00:16.281
This runs counter
to your programming.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.200
Fun remember?

00:18.201 --> 00:20.118
[reporter] the search continues
for emperor ishida's murderer

00:20.121 --> 00:23.422
Purported to be his own son,
crown prince ishida ryo.

00:23.424 --> 00:29.094
We just... Murdered
ten thousand innocent civilians.

00:40.174 --> 00:44.109

00:44.111 --> 00:50.616

00:56.157 --> 00:57.222
[six]
you draves?

00:57.224 --> 00:58.390
Maybe.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.725
I'm lookin' for someone.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.194
Yeah? Who?

01:02.196 --> 01:05.564
He's the leader of
the procyon insurrection.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.199
They call him the general.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.101
[draves chuckling]

01:09.103 --> 01:10.719
What's so funny?

01:10.720 --> 01:12.336
He's the most wanted man
in the galaxy.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.673
What makes you think
i know where he is?

01:14.675 --> 01:17.342
Well, he's been using
arrakis sadr as his base,

01:17.344 --> 01:20.712
And since this is the closest
station to that planet,

01:20.714 --> 01:24.216
It's a good bet his supply line
runs through here.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.219
And to keep below the radar,
he has to be doing business

01:27.221 --> 01:29.188
With the local criminal element.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.355
You're it, no offense.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.224
And i hope you're not offended

01:32.226 --> 01:33.525
If i tell you you're insane.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.594
Do you know how many
people he's killed?

01:35.596 --> 01:38.230
I've got an interesting
business proposition for him.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.533
You put me in touch with him
and i'll make it worth your whi;

01:41.535 --> 01:45.304
Ten thousand bars transferred
directly into your account.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.473
I can do better.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.208
Twelve thousand.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.275
You misunderstood me.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.112
I said i can do better.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.213
[six chuckles]
whoa.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.114
What's going on here?

01:55.116 --> 01:56.482

griffin jones.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.284
Wanted for
smuggling, piracy, murder.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.186
It's quite the rap sheet.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.155
And a hell of
a bounty to go with it.

02:07.595 --> 02:11.897

[draves grunts]

02:49.236 --> 02:52.604
What part of "we need him alive"
didn't you understand?

02:52.606 --> 02:55.440
[draves panting]
sorry, boss.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.378
[body disintegrates]

03:23.470 --> 03:24.603
[one screams in pain]

03:24.605 --> 03:25.337
Aaaah.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.939
What are you doing?

03:26.941 --> 03:29.341
[one groans in pain]

03:29.343 --> 03:31.910
I was surprising you
with a hug.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.679
Why?

03:33.680 --> 03:35.447
[one panting] i don't know,
i thought you'd enjoy it?

03:36.483 --> 03:38.850
Do i look like someone
who enjoys surprise hugs?

03:38.852 --> 03:41.987
In retrospect no,
not at all.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.789
Let's keep it professional, ok?

03:43.791 --> 03:45.657
[annoyed]
okay.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.529
How's she doing?

03:50.531 --> 03:53.532
The corrector nanites
in her body are damn impressive.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.867
I'd say she's about
85 percent healed.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.969
So, close enough.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.470
We gonna bring her online?

03:58.472 --> 03:59.771
Not yet.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.840
She'll be good to go
by day's end.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.509
But we're 20 minutes
out from the space station.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.611
We gonna shuttle in?

04:05.613 --> 04:07.279
No, we'll dock.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.748
Well how're we gonna
dock without the android?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.516
I'll take us in.

04:28.002 --> 04:29.701
Just giving
everyone a heads up.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.904
We're about to dock.

04:38.812 --> 04:42.414
If you're looking for
a seat belt, you're out of luck.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.583
Of course not.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.751
I was just--
adjusting my seat.

04:48.555 --> 04:52.791
[keyboard keys clacking]

04:52.793 --> 04:54.793
Here we go...

05:28.062 --> 05:34.066
[computer powers down docking r]

05:38.872 --> 05:40.806
And we're docked.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.678
Never doubted you.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.714
Uh-huh.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.783
[two]
okay, supply run.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.085
One, you're on
infirmary restock.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.619
You got your list?

05:54.621 --> 05:55.721
Got it.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.489
Four, seeds to keep
hydroponics going.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.890
Five, you've got gak...

05:58.892 --> 06:02.394
Connectors, adapters,
and 3-12 sprockets.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.763
That's what i said.

06:04.765 --> 06:05.764
Three, you've got juice.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.599
Make sure that um--

06:07.601 --> 06:08.834
Where the hell's three?

06:08.836 --> 06:09.935
[five]
in his room.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.004
He says he's not coming.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.973
I'll get him.

06:14.975 --> 06:15.941
Give him some time.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.877
He's had enough time.

06:25.919 --> 06:26.852
[knocking]

06:26.854 --> 06:28.620
Get lost.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.823
[door slides open]

06:31.825 --> 06:32.991
What's the point of knocking

06:32.993 --> 06:35.660
If you're just going
to come in anyway?

06:35.662 --> 06:36.895
It's polite.

06:36.897 --> 06:37.963
Are you coming?

06:37.965 --> 06:40.132
Nah, i got stuff to do.

06:40.134 --> 06:40.932
Such as?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.501
Cleaning my guns.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.636
Working out.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.037
Cleaning my guns.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.407
Alright well we haven't been
off this ship in a few days.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.975
Who knows when we'll
get another chance.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.043
Well, you have a good time.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.015
You need to move on.

06:57.017 --> 07:01.520
I'm thinking "moving on" is
what i've been doing all my lif.

07:01.522 --> 07:08.059
Maybe it's time i stopped,
and considered the consequences.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.762
Consequences imply
that you were responsible.

07:10.764 --> 07:16.034
She was relying on me...
And i failed her.

07:16.036 --> 07:20.071
She believed in you
with good reason.

07:20.073 --> 07:23.608
You did everything you could.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.210
[four sighs]

07:25.212 --> 07:28.213
We all owe you our lives.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.123
[two]
okay, same drill as last time.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.459
We're docked under
a false registration.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.929
Just remember don't draw any
unnecessary attention to yourse.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.998
And, yes, i speak from experien.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.200
Think he'll come?

07:48.202 --> 07:50.569
In the interest of us
getting some actual r&r,

07:50.571 --> 07:52.070
I hope not.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.104
Oh, come on.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.606
You're all thinking
the same thing,

07:54.608 --> 07:58.543
I'm just the only one
with the guts to say it.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.245
[three]
alright!

08:00.247 --> 08:02.013
There he is!

08:02.015 --> 08:03.982
Bring it on.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.117
Let's do this boys!

08:06.119 --> 08:07.886
Huh?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.597
Okay, what's up first?

08:18.599 --> 08:20.932
Shops, spa, food--

08:20.934 --> 08:21.933
[five]
food!

08:21.935 --> 08:23.719
[three]
spa!

08:23.720 --> 08:25.504
Seriously, kidding, food.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.106
Alright lets get some grub.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.174
[six]
eh, you guys go ahead.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.642
I'll catch up with you.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.243
Are you sure?

08:31.245 --> 08:32.461
Yeah.

08:32.462 --> 08:33.678
Alright, knock yourself out.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.633
[five]
what?

08:38.634 --> 08:40.150
Aren't you going to
get something to eat?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.920
No, i'd rather hang with you.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.657
No.

08:45.659 --> 08:49.528
What i mean is, i just need
some time to myself okay.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.796
But we'll hang out later.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.565
Okay...

09:28.068 --> 09:29.801
[one]
garlic?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.336
It's not garlic... Parsley?

09:31.338 --> 09:32.571
[two]
yes.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.872
[four]
onions, mushrooms--

09:33.874 --> 09:35.307
No, no, no mushrooms.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.175
It's nuts?

09:37.177 --> 09:38.076
What's that flavor?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.178
Nuts!

09:40.180 --> 09:42.113
Mealworms.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.719
[three] when you say mealworms,

09:47.720 --> 09:49.320
Is that one of those words
that sounds like something,

09:49.323 --> 09:51.156
But means something
completely different?

09:51.158 --> 09:53.291
Like "firearms"
or "anal-geesic"?

09:53.293 --> 09:55.360
It's pronounced "annal-jezik,"

09:55.362 --> 09:58.163
And mealworms are
worms-- well larvae.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.966
They're protein-rich and
a hell of a lot less expensive

10:00.968 --> 10:02.901
And easier to source than beef.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.005
Meh.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.108
[one] excuse me,
c-could i see menu please?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.177
So you're not gonna eat that?

10:14.615 --> 10:15.747
Cheers.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.785
[callie]
griffin jones.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.221
Wanted for
smuggling, piracy, murder.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.724
I had one of my boys
run a face recog

10:25.726 --> 10:27.959
When you started
asking around about me.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.995
Curious that way.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.063
Hands behind your back.

10:33.700 --> 10:38.003
[fighting noises]
oof, ugh, urg

10:40.674 --> 10:41.840
[rapid gunshots]
bang, bang, bang

10:41.842 --> 10:42.907
[gunshells clatter to ground]

10:44.645 --> 10:48.013
[draves panting]

10:50.717 --> 10:56.921
[alarm dinging]
ding, ding, ding

11:09.936 --> 11:11.870
[woman]
how do you feel?

11:11.872 --> 11:13.905
Fine.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.840
Why don't i remember
what happened?

11:15.842 --> 11:18.076
If your clone returned
to its transfer pod,

11:18.078 --> 11:19.911
All new memories
should've been sent back

11:19.913 --> 11:22.914
And uploaded into
your temporal lobe.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.149
Well, they weren't.

11:24.151 --> 11:27.052
It seems your trip
was terminated early.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.422
No bio-mass
recycling was recorded.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.857
Your clone died.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.092
Does it say how?

11:34.094 --> 11:37.328
Just that we lost vital
signs at 21:34 hours

11:37.330 --> 11:39.864
Which triggered
your early wake up.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.167
Could've been an accident...

11:42.169 --> 11:44.102
Or natural causes.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.937
What do you mean,
natural causes?

11:45.939 --> 11:48.973
Genetic conditions can be
transferred to the clone...

11:48.975 --> 11:50.975
No, it wasn't that.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.877
Put me back in.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.046
Our policy states
that transfer travellers

11:55.048 --> 11:56.881
Have to wait
30 minutes between travels.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.850
I don't have that kind of time.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.452
It's a precautionary measure

12:00.454 --> 12:02.120
To guard against
stress-induced complications.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.021
Come on.

12:03.023 --> 12:03.955
Sorry.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.023
Regulations.

12:05.025 --> 12:09.327
Just-- look, i get it.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.930
You're a cog
in a big machine.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.766
Keep your head down,
put in your time,

12:14.768 --> 12:18.069
Retire and hopefully you die
before the savings run out.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.439
It's a solid plan,
but i've gotta ask:

12:21.441 --> 12:23.274
Doesn't it ever get to you?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.376
I mean haven't you
ever wanted to just--

12:25.378 --> 12:28.113
Once-- stand up for yourself?

12:28.115 --> 12:31.116
Stick it to the big
faceless corporation?

12:31.118 --> 12:33.518
Break one of their stupid rules?

12:35.756 --> 12:39.324
By letting you transfer
30 minutes early?

12:39.326 --> 12:41.392
Uh, for example.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.031
It's your cerebral cortex.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.967
Thank you.

13:00.046 --> 13:05.517
[glasses clinking]

13:05.519 --> 13:07.986
Do you know when
i decided i liked you?

13:07.988 --> 13:09.320
When i didn't
shoot shoot you

13:09.322 --> 13:11.222
When you tried
to steal the ship?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.024
No.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.927
When you abandoned us
on that mining planet.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.996
Yeah?

13:17.997 --> 13:20.064
Yeah, at first, i thought
you'd screwed us over, right?

13:20.066 --> 13:23.168
And i thought,
"damn. I like this girl."

13:23.170 --> 13:26.037
But then, when you came
back and you saved our asses,

13:26.039 --> 13:28.540
I was like:
"damn. I really like this girl."

13:28.542 --> 13:30.041
[two giggles]

13:30.043 --> 13:33.178
Yeah, you guys, i mean.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.013
You guys are great man.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.148
I may not say it enough but--

13:37.150 --> 13:38.116
Or at all.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.551
Ever.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.085
But you guys--

13:41.087 --> 13:42.387
[one]
hey!

13:42.389 --> 13:43.922
[three]
hey you!

13:43.924 --> 13:45.924
What's wrong with you guys?

13:45.926 --> 13:47.592
You're leaving me
hanging, fiver.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.028
What do you mean?

13:50.030 --> 13:52.864
We'll you're all...
Getting along.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.966
It's weird.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.067
Are you drunk?

13:56.069 --> 13:57.101
Of course we're drunk.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.169
Have a seat.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.371
Here, have some-- eat.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.306
No.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.107
And drink something.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.412
What's the matter?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.947
It's six.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.515
He's gone off the station.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.482
What?

14:11.484 --> 14:12.750
[one]
what!

14:12.751 --> 14:14.017
[two] what do you mean,
he's not on the station?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.153
[four]
where'd he go?

14:15.154 --> 14:16.287
[three] bastard
stole our ship!

14:16.289 --> 14:17.372
[one]
hey, hey, hey!

14:17.373 --> 14:18.456
[five] no, the ship's still her.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.424
[three]
what?

14:19.426 --> 14:20.558
And so is he, kind of.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.493
Hang on a second.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.995
What are you drunk?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.997
Is he here, or is he not here?

14:25.999 --> 14:29.334
He's using transfer transit.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.069
What's transfer transit?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.438
It's state-of-the-art travel te.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.608
[five] you get into a "transfer"
and input a destination.

14:36.610 --> 14:40.245
The pod sequences your dna
and maps your brain.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.981
Then, that information
gets sent via subspace...

14:42.983 --> 14:48.286
Anywhere across the galaxy
where there's a receiver pod...

14:50.290 --> 14:52.223
[five] where they
create a clone of you,

14:52.225 --> 14:55.460
Complete with your
memories and personality.

14:55.462 --> 14:59.130
It's like flesh
and blood 3d-printing.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.414
[six laughs]
wow.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.150
[five] but the clone
has a short life span--

15:19.152 --> 15:21.102
A few days, maybe.

15:21.103 --> 15:23.053
It has to return to its
transfer pod before that time

15:23.056 --> 15:25.189
So all the new memories
and experiences

15:25.191 --> 15:28.126
Can be sent back to you
before you wake up.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.930
How the hell do
you know all this?

15:31.932 --> 15:33.097
I read the brochure.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.666
Hang on.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.367
Just go back.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.536
What the hell's
transfer transit?

15:38.538 --> 15:42.073
No, stop. Six would never
submit to a dna scan.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.708
Not after what
happened last time.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.011
It says all dna profiles
are kept strictly confidential.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.346
Yeah they would have to be,

15:48.348 --> 15:50.415
Otherwise they'd lose
a lot of business fast.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.550
Still, it's risky.

15:52.552 --> 15:56.187
He must've wanted to go
somewhere pretty badly.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.190
Wherever he's going,
whatever he's doing,

15:59.192 --> 16:01.960
It can't be good for us.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.090
[woman]
you're back.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.191
I am.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.592
What'll it be this time?

16:34.594 --> 16:37.161
Merchandise or more information?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.163
Information.

16:39.165 --> 16:42.066
I came in here earlier.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.167
Yeah...

16:43.169 --> 16:45.169
And i needed help
finding someone.

16:45.171 --> 16:49.374
And i gave you a name
and sent you on your way.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.175
That name again?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.643
What?

16:52.645 --> 16:55.446
What was the name
you gave me earlier?

16:55.448 --> 16:57.615
Draves.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.384
Wanna write it
down this time?

16:59.386 --> 17:02.286
Nah, i'm good, thanks.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.155
Sure.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.124
See you around.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.129
Not if i get it right this time.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.132
[walkie talkie clicks on]

17:14.134 --> 17:15.383
[draves]
yeah?

17:15.384 --> 17:16.633
[woman]
yeah, it's me.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.236
He's on his way down.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.303
[walkie talkie clicks off]

17:23.243 --> 17:25.743
Are you sure we should be
going through his stuff?

17:25.745 --> 17:28.112
Pretty sure. Yeah.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.181
It's not right,
it's an invasion of his privacy.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.183
[three] you didn't have
a problem invading my privacy

17:32.185 --> 17:33.451
When you stole my bullets.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.869
[five]
that was different.

17:34.870 --> 17:36.286
I thought you were dangerous.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.356
Look, i didn't want
to get him in trouble,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.258
I just thought it was weird

17:40.260 --> 17:42.126
That he was keeping
something from us.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.162
That maybe he needed our help.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.681
[three]
i knew it!

17:46.682 --> 17:49.199
He's been hoarding the green
not-as-crap-tastic protein bars!

17:49.202 --> 17:51.135
He said we were out!

17:52.539 --> 17:54.372
I got stuck
eating the blue ones.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.207
They taste fishy!

17:56.209 --> 17:58.376
[keyboard keys clacking]
[computer beeps]

17:58.378 --> 17:59.710
[four]
hmmm.

17:59.712 --> 18:00.578
What've you got?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.313
[keyboard keys clacking]

18:02.315 --> 18:03.314
[computer beeps]

18:03.316 --> 18:05.183
Great.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.250
[keyboard keys clacking]

18:06.252 --> 18:07.385
Try "six."

18:07.387 --> 18:08.619
[keyboard keys clacking]
[computer beeps]

18:08.621 --> 18:10.354
[four]
uh-uh.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.323
Try "lying hoarder"?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.791
We can waste all day guessing.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.528
We have to find a way
to bypass the password.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.300
No way.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.403
Look at it this way:
You'll be proving his innocence.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.777
[five sighs]

18:36.182 --> 18:37.615
[keyboard keys clacking]

18:37.617 --> 18:40.384
[computer processing]

18:40.386 --> 18:49.627
[keyboard keys clacking]

18:51.498 --> 18:56.234
He was researching a terrorist
attack on some space station.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.169
A lot of people were killed.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.640
[reporter]
breaking news.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.343
We have an update on
the bombing of station hyadum 12

19:05.345 --> 19:07.411
By the anti-corporate
terrorist group

19:07.413 --> 19:10.414
Calling itself
the procyon insurrection.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.817
Over ten thousand lives
were lost in the attack,

19:12.819 --> 19:16.787
And today investigators
released the following video.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.923
[reporter] security footage
uploaded to the g.A. Hub

19:18.925 --> 19:21.792
Before the station's
destruction clearly shows

19:21.794 --> 19:25.763
One of the suspects believed to
be responsible for the bombing.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.267
If you see this man,
do not attempt to apprehend him,

19:29.269 --> 19:32.603
But call your nearest g.A.
Detachment immediately.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.539
And you thought
i was dangerous?

19:44.884 --> 19:46.551
It was instinct.
I'm sorry.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.818
Well your instincts
are terrible.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.820
And nearly cost us
a huge pay day.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.422
I'll be careful this time.
I promise.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.524
Nice and simple, right?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.793
We tell him we're
taking him to the general--

19:55.795 --> 19:58.729
Then we capture him,
alive, torture him,

19:58.731 --> 20:01.532
And then we get him
to give up his real location.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.800
What if he gets suspicious?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.569
There's no reason
for him to be.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.571
His first clone took
its memories with it.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.407
As far as he knows,
we're meeting for the first tim.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.783
You draves?

20:18.785 --> 20:20.384
Maybe.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.722
So what can i do for you?

20:24.724 --> 20:29.227
[fighting noises]
oof, ugh, arg

20:29.229 --> 20:30.428
[gun shots]
bang, bang, bang

20:30.430 --> 20:32.830
[draves]
no, wait--!

20:32.999 --> 20:35.116
Whoa, whoa, take it easy.

20:35.117 --> 20:37.234
I had nothing to do with this,
i'm just the girlfriend.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.402
Like hell you are.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.404
You're way out of his league.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.940
Besides, your nails don't
quite match your outfit.

20:42.942 --> 20:46.344
They're nice and short,
ideal for handling a gun.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.379
Last time i was here
i missed something.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.847
Not sure what it was,

20:49.849 --> 20:55.453
But this time i'm not
gonna take any chances.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.522
And that means shooting
you before you can draw.

21:09.669 --> 21:13.938
Now, i need some
information and a shuttle.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.991
[five]
i don't believe it.

21:16.992 --> 21:18.375
He couldn't have
killed all those people.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.877
[four] why, because
he's nice to you?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.379
You think that means anything?

21:21.381 --> 21:23.047
[three] it does seem
a little hardcore.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.448
Even for one of us.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.416
It's a mistake.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.418
It has to be.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.754
[one]
what about calchek?

21:29.756 --> 21:32.556
He knows our histories,
maybe we should call him.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.493
No, it's too risky.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.861
[two] if we start asking for
information we should already k,

21:36.863 --> 21:39.530
He could get suspicious.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.699
And i-if he finds out
about our memory loss,

21:41.701 --> 21:44.935
He could consider us damaged
goods and end our arrangement.

21:44.937 --> 21:48.506
Or worse, make
a move against us.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.975
[one]
other ideas?

21:50.977 --> 21:54.412
[four] we follow six
and find out for ourselves.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.714
[sarcastic]
that's a damn good idea!

21:56.715 --> 21:59.015
We just go hang out by his pod,
wait for him to wake up,

21:59.018 --> 22:01.519
Make him cough up some answers.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.087
[four] i mean we use
the transfer technology,

22:03.089 --> 22:04.889
And see what he's up to.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.724
[three] there's no way
i'm getting sealed up

22:06.726 --> 22:08.759
In one of those things,
all gift-wrapped

22:08.761 --> 22:11.562
And helpless for the g.A,
no fricken way.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.830
I'll do it.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.098
He did it for me.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.833
With the android
out of commission,

22:15.835 --> 22:19.470
We need you here,
you're our resident tech expert.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.539
I'll go.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.607
You go with him.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.409
Hang on.

22:25.411 --> 22:28.646
He, uncharacteristically,
makes a good point.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.548
You're pretty damn
vulnerable lying trapped,

22:30.550 --> 22:31.682
In one of those things.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.750
[two]
six respects you.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.135
If there's any confrontation,

22:34.136 --> 22:35.519
You'll be able to
reason with him.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.588
You have to go.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.525
[woman] for the
duration of your travel,

22:41.527 --> 22:44.095
Your body will remain
here in cryo-sleep.

22:44.097 --> 22:47.365
When your clone returns for
bio-mass recycling at the end o,

22:47.367 --> 22:50.101
Its experiences and memories
will be uploaded,

22:50.103 --> 22:52.870
Transferred back,
and reintegrated with your own.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.572
Is it safe?

22:54.574 --> 22:55.573
Absolutely.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.974
It's the safest way to travel.

22:56.976 --> 23:00.578
With your true body here,
you're never in any real danger.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.913
Your clone could travel
into the center of a star,

23:02.915 --> 23:05.015
And you'd be perfectly fine.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.651
The possibility of
any critical complications

23:07.653 --> 23:09.086
Is extremely remote.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.522
What do you mean
by critical complications?

23:11.524 --> 23:13.424
It's barely worth mentioning.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.760
There have been
a handful of incidents--

23:15.762 --> 23:18.028
Strokes, heart attacks,
the occasional aneurysm,

23:18.030 --> 23:20.431
But a causal link back
to the technology

23:20.433 --> 23:21.799
Has never been established.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.467
Well, that doesn't sound so--

23:23.469 --> 23:24.902
Sold.

23:24.904 --> 23:29.707
Excellent, let's see when
we've got a slot available...

23:29.709 --> 23:30.975
How about next--

23:30.977 --> 23:33.110
How about right now.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.945
Right now?

23:34.947 --> 23:38.482
Okay, let's get you signed up.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.617
Are you a couple?

23:39.619 --> 23:40.718
[one]
uh, no--

23:40.720 --> 23:41.719
[four]
is there a discount?

23:41.721 --> 23:43.154
Ten percent.

23:43.156 --> 23:49.560
[four] well then yes,
we are a couple.

23:49.562 --> 23:53.831
Also, a good friend of ours
was in earlier today.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.533
Griffin jones.

23:55.535 --> 23:58.102
We'd like to meet up with him.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.571
Did he tell you
where he was going?

24:00.573 --> 24:01.939
Uh, no.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.108
He doesn't know
we're meeting up with him.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.476
It's a surprise.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.711
Yeah, it's his birthday.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.747
Uh-huh.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.650
Well i can't divulge information
about other customers.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.152
It's against company policy.

24:15.154 --> 24:19.957
Also, it's definitely
not his birthday.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.525
That's one of the things

24:21.527 --> 24:23.794
You have to provide
when you sign up.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.630
Let me ask you something.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.199
Haven't you ever been tempted

24:28.201 --> 24:30.868
To just break
the rules, and finally--

24:30.870 --> 24:33.771
Get back at my big
faceless corporate bosses

24:33.773 --> 24:37.908
For making me feel so
small and insignificant?

24:37.910 --> 24:39.610
Uh...

25:08.841 --> 25:10.875
Send red team to
pick up the shipment.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.644
Sir, i've detected
an incoming shuttle.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.579
Headed our way.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.017
First squad, with me.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.719
Update us if you hear anything.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.654
Yes, sir.

25:25.157 --> 25:28.692
Okay, i've entered your
destination coordinates

25:28.694 --> 25:30.661
And you're all set.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.596
Just lie back and relax.

25:36.602 --> 25:41.639
Hang on, what if there's
some kind of m-medical issue?

25:41.641 --> 25:45.109
The system automatically monitos
for signs of physical distress.

25:45.111 --> 25:48.612
At the first indication,
you'll be pulled right out.

25:48.614 --> 25:51.715
Okay. Good.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.817
Good.

25:53.819 --> 25:55.803
Wait!

25:55.804 --> 25:57.788
W-what if t-there's a fire?

25:57.790 --> 26:01.325
In all station-related
emergencies,

26:01.327 --> 26:05.863
My first priority is to awaken l
travellers and get them to safe.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.232
Ready.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.266
Hang on, what if--

26:09.268 --> 26:12.169
Wait, wait, hang on, hey, wait--

26:12.171 --> 26:17.007
Wait, hey, excuse me,
excuse me, hello?

26:29.355 --> 26:31.121
[gun cocking]

26:32.325 --> 26:35.859
[man]
that's far enough.

26:35.861 --> 26:38.162
You've got some
balls coming here.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.930
I'm unarmed.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.677
I'm here to see the general.

26:53.679 --> 26:56.380
Just so happens
he's waiting for you.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.259
You ready?

27:42.261 --> 27:43.394
[one]
yeah.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.329
Let's go find six.

27:47.933 --> 27:48.932
What the hell man?!

27:48.934 --> 27:50.701
Who are you?
Where is he?!

27:50.703 --> 27:56.073
What are you talking about--

27:56.075 --> 27:58.008
Oh, crap.

28:01.447 --> 28:02.413
[one sighs]

28:02.415 --> 28:04.782
Who are you?

28:04.784 --> 28:08.385
It's me, it's one.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.853
You're four.

28:09.855 --> 28:13.057
The rest of the crew
is back on the raza.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.392
We just used
the transfer tech to follow six

28:15.394 --> 28:19.430
To this space station to
find out what he's up to.

28:19.432 --> 28:21.732
Three is an asshole.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.936
It is you.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.705
Yeah.

28:31.444 --> 28:35.279
A glitch in the
transfer process?

28:35.281 --> 28:37.715
[four] can't be,
this body was constructed

28:37.717 --> 28:39.316
On your dna template, so--

28:39.318 --> 28:44.054
This is my real body.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.490
This is what i look like.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.759
Really look like.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.744
I'm sorry.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.412
[five gasps]

29:08.414 --> 29:10.948
You're awake!

29:10.950 --> 29:13.450
My systems is
93 percent restored,

29:13.452 --> 29:15.385
But my corrector nanites
are more efficient

29:15.387 --> 29:17.454
While i'm in sleep mode.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.390
Well, welcome back.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.860
Thank you.

29:22.862 --> 29:25.062
Why are you sorry?

29:25.064 --> 29:27.164
You got hurt because of me.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.366
I possess no pain receptors.

29:29.368 --> 29:33.303
I mean you were
damaged by that other android

29:33.305 --> 29:37.474
Because i suggested
that you apologize to her.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.343
I apologized
because you presented

29:39.345 --> 29:41.812
A reasoned argument to do so.

29:41.814 --> 29:44.448
I had no choice but to
respond accordingly.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.283
Of course you had a choice.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.484
In fact, no.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.154
I'm a logic-based entity,

29:50.156 --> 29:52.956
Therefore, i act and react
in a purely logical manner.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.225
No, no you don't.

29:55.227 --> 30:02.132
I've seen you angry,
sad, lonely, happy.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.434
You might not
have pain receptors,

30:04.436 --> 30:07.237
But your feelings can get hurt.

30:07.239 --> 30:10.874
I've seen it happen.

30:10.876 --> 30:16.146
You were jealous of wendy.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.515
I was not jealous.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.851
Think of the impression
that she made on you,

30:20.853 --> 30:24.254
When you saw her with us.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.391
Now that i think of it,
i did experience a sensation

30:27.393 --> 30:29.393
That could be misconstrued
as human resentment.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.861
No.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.997
That was jealousy.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.234
And you know what that means.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.870
My programming is flawed.

30:39.872 --> 30:45.409
No, you have feelings.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.911
Congratulations.

31:01.594 --> 31:03.861
Hopefully this
draves fellow shows up.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.200
Look, i'm sorry.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.270
I should've just
come clean sooner.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.504
True.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.941
I don't know why i was
posing as jace corso.

31:17.943 --> 31:19.576
I don't remember.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.612
So whatever hidden
agenda i might have had,

31:21.614 --> 31:24.948
It's gone now, right?

31:24.950 --> 31:26.984
I know you can't speak
for anyone else,

31:26.986 --> 31:30.354
So i just want to know
where i stand with you.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.955
We cool?

31:31.957 --> 31:37.194
At the moment, i think
i'm the least of your worries.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.630
You wanted to talk to me?

31:39.632 --> 31:41.465
We're looking for someone.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.299
Seems a lot of people
are doing that today.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.969
Big guy, came through
about an hour ago.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.372
Last we heard, he was
headed in your direction.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.140
Yeah, i know
where your friend is.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.441
He's no friend of ours.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.077
Then what's your
business with him?

31:54.079 --> 31:57.047
Payback.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.549
Well, why didn't
you just say so?

32:03.489 --> 32:05.255
Hey griff.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.691
Good to see you again.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.394
So, what brings you
back after all this time?

32:10.396 --> 32:11.962
Unfinished business.

32:11.964 --> 32:16.300
Huh. Thought you
were just tired of running.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.969
It must get really exhausting,

32:18.971 --> 32:20.704
Always having to look
over your shoulder...

32:20.706 --> 32:23.073
Never too sure who you can trus.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.208
I imagine it's hard
making new friends

32:25.210 --> 32:27.611
When you have a reputation
for killing the old ones.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.546
They weren't my friends.

32:29.548 --> 32:33.116
They were your brothers
in arms and they trusted you.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.452
And i trusted you
when i flew that shuttle

32:35.454 --> 32:38.188
Onto the station to
take that g.A. Cruiser.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.692
You manipulated me, made
me complicit in mass murder.

32:41.694 --> 32:43.160
You were a soldier.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.661
My soldier.

32:44.663 --> 32:47.597
And we were at war
and that station,

32:47.599 --> 32:49.633
That was a legitimate target.

32:49.635 --> 32:54.171
Over ten thousand lives
were lost, including children.

32:54.173 --> 32:58.475
Hundreds die every day under
corporate rule, and the galacti-

32:58.477 --> 33:02.579
Our protectors,
they stand by and let it happen.

33:02.581 --> 33:07.351
There's no such thing
as a bloodless revolution.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.588
You know you were
a good soldier, griff.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.390
Determined.

33:13.392 --> 33:14.624
Relentless.

33:14.626 --> 33:17.494
The very qualities
that now make you a threat.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.497
You'll be dead
before your friends arrive.

33:20.733 --> 33:22.532
Oh!

33:22.534 --> 33:25.736
Apparently they're on their way.

33:25.738 --> 33:29.606
And my men, they are more
than ready to welcome them.

33:35.414 --> 33:36.646
You keep checking the time.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.149
You waiting for something?

33:39.151 --> 33:41.084
Son-of-a-bitch.

33:41.086 --> 33:45.422
Well, griff, timing?
Not really your strong suit...

33:47.459 --> 33:54.464
[explosion]

33:54.466 --> 33:57.601
[shots fired]
bang, bang

33:59.138 --> 34:00.670
What the hell was that?

34:00.672 --> 34:03.040
I figured this was
a one-way trip,

34:03.042 --> 34:05.242
So i set my shuttle
to go critical.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.611
Though it did take a bit
longer than i thought.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.680
Timing not being
my strong suit, right?

34:15.621 --> 34:20.290
[groan]

34:20.292 --> 34:34.704
[both men grunting and gasping]

34:34.706 --> 34:40.777
[six panting]

34:52.724 --> 34:54.658
Are you kidding me.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.310
What have you done?

35:13.312 --> 35:14.544
He was a clone.

35:14.546 --> 35:17.314
I know.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.349
So am i.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.651
So shoot, don't shoot.

35:21.653 --> 35:25.222
It's not gonna make much
of a difference in the long run.

35:27.559 --> 35:34.698
[gun shots]

35:52.384 --> 35:53.483
How'd you find me?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.352
We asked around.

35:55.354 --> 35:58.688
Who's your friend?

35:58.690 --> 36:00.457
Long story.

36:04.329 --> 36:05.462
[two]
you lied to us.

36:05.464 --> 36:08.665
I didn't so much lie as...

36:08.667 --> 36:11.368
Slightly delay
telling the truth.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.937
Oh, really?

36:13.939 --> 36:17.707
And when exactly were you
planning to tell us that truth?

36:17.709 --> 36:20.810
Honestly?

36:20.812 --> 36:24.347
I don't know.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.850
I was looking for the
right opportunity but...

36:26.852 --> 36:28.919
When's a good time
to tell your friends

36:28.921 --> 36:30.720
You're not who
they thought you were?

36:30.722 --> 36:33.657
Hell, you're not who
you thought you were.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.431
All i know is
i assumed an identity

36:41.433 --> 36:42.732
To get onboard this ship.

36:42.734 --> 36:48.705
As to why, i have no idea.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.807
Right after that incident
with the real jace corso,

36:50.809 --> 36:53.376
You should have
told us everything.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.412
Hiding the truth
makes us vulnerable.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.980
If corso had come back at us,

36:56.982 --> 36:59.482
We never would
have seen him coming.

36:59.484 --> 37:01.985
I know.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.720
I didn't think it through.

37:03.722 --> 37:08.358
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell us?

37:08.360 --> 37:09.859
Now's the time.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.328
[two]
and you!

37:11.330 --> 37:13.296
You knew, and kept it a secret.

37:13.298 --> 37:14.598
That's just as bad.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.467
It's not as bad.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.536
It was strictly for
blackmail purposes.

37:19.538 --> 37:20.737
We don't keep secrets,

37:20.739 --> 37:23.440
And we don't
blackmail each other either.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.841
Fine.

37:26.945 --> 37:30.397
[two]
and you.

37:30.398 --> 37:33.850
What reason do you have
for putting us all at risk?

37:33.852 --> 37:36.486
It was something
i had to do alone.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.456
I didn't want any of you
talking me out of it.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.358
Or screwing it up.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.559
That's an apology?

37:42.561 --> 37:44.561
No.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.396
It's me being honest.

37:46.398 --> 37:49.733
That's what you want, isn't it?

37:49.735 --> 37:55.639
What i want is for us to
be able to trust each other.

37:55.641 --> 37:58.908
Moving forward,
no more lies, no more secrets.

37:58.910 --> 38:02.379
We have to have faith in each
other if we're going to survive.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.947
But despite everything
that we've been through,

38:03.949 --> 38:05.849
We just can't seem to do it.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.517
Whoever wiped our memories,

38:07.519 --> 38:11.454
Probably did it to make it
harder for us to work together.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.356
Guess what?

38:13.358 --> 38:14.924
It worked.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.549
[two]
it all looks good.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.084
Are you sure?

38:41.086 --> 38:44.020
No discernible abnormalities?

38:44.022 --> 38:46.456
None that i can see.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.624
Why?

38:47.625 --> 38:48.791
Are you worried
about something?

38:48.794 --> 38:50.760
You're implying
i experience anxiety.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.796
What are you suggesting?

38:52.798 --> 38:53.830
Nothing.

38:53.832 --> 38:54.764
Wow.

38:54.766 --> 38:55.865
Touchy.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.834
Suggestive of hypersensitivity.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.769
All the diagnostics show normal.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.538
You're fine.

39:01.540 --> 39:05.442
Which is more than i can say
for the rest of the crew.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.911
What's wrong with
the rest of the crew?

39:07.913 --> 39:11.848
The atmosphere
on this ship is bad.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.450
The atmosphere is optimal.

39:13.452 --> 39:19.089
It's 78.084% nitrogen,
20.9476% oxygen, 0.--

39:19.091 --> 39:21.057
Morale.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.360
I mean morale is bad.

39:23.362 --> 39:26.529
Yes, that is suboptimal.

39:26.531 --> 39:29.032
We have to find a way
to trust each other.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.067
I mean, if we
can't even do that,

39:31.069 --> 39:32.936
How can we possibly
hope to survive?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.871
How indeed.

39:37.376 --> 39:40.143
You look like you
want to say something.

39:40.145 --> 39:45.415
If you honestly feel this way,
why don't you tell them?

39:45.417 --> 39:46.916
Tell them what?

39:46.918 --> 39:48.518
The truth.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.456
About yourself.

40:15.147 --> 40:16.012
[five]
hey!

40:16.014 --> 40:17.781
Hey.

40:17.783 --> 40:18.982
How was your workout?

40:18.984 --> 40:20.049
It was good.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.651
Hey.

40:24.156 --> 40:26.956
We've got another 3 hours or so
before they finish repairs on tp

40:26.958 --> 40:31.494
And some of us were thinking of
heading into the station to cat.

40:31.496 --> 40:32.495
Do you wanna come?

40:32.497 --> 40:33.630
No thanks.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.800
But it's star wars 36.

40:36.802 --> 40:40.904
Remastered in full vr,
they say it's a classic.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.472
Naw, i'm good.

40:42.474 --> 40:44.874
Have fun though.

40:44.876 --> 40:48.011
But you said we
would hang out later...

40:48.013 --> 40:49.946
[door slides shut]

41:02.527 --> 41:03.860
This is the ishida directorate.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.795
How may i help you?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.497
You know who i am.

41:07.499 --> 41:12.135
I wish to speak with hiro.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.736
One moment.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.744
Ryo?

41:21.746 --> 41:23.513
Hello, brother.

41:30.255 --> 41:31.855
[beep]

42:14.599 --> 42:17.567
There was a dramatic development
today in the investigation

42:17.569 --> 42:19.969
Into the death of catherine mos,

42:19.971 --> 42:23.740
The wife of corelactic industri'
new ceo, derrick moss.

42:23.742 --> 42:26.309
The galactic authority
identified this man,

42:26.311 --> 42:29.245
Marcus boone,
as a suspect in the case.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.180
Boone is a career criminal

42:31.182 --> 42:34.117
Already wanted on
dozens of unrelated charges.

42:34.119 --> 42:37.854
He is considered armed
and extremely dangerous.
