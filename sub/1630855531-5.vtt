WEBVTT

00:17.480 --> 00:19.160
I'm requisitioning some demons.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.560
- Oh, yeah.
- I have full authorization from Beelzebub.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.040
I can launch
a demonic invasion upon London.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.760
Demons?

00:27.760 --> 00:31.720
I want only the worst, I want
the worst of the worst, I want killers.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.840
Mm-hmm.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.200
Right, so how many?

00:37.080 --> 00:40.360
10,000 demons.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.680
Sorry, I thought you said 10,000.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.240
- Are you actually going through with this?
- Indeed, I am.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.920
Can I watch?

01:20.040 --> 01:22.480
Oh, that's most appropriate.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.840
I'll need you to bring
that with you tonight.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.040
- Mm-hmm?
- Oh, it's very important.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.840
'Cause I'll need musicians at the Whickber
Street Traders and Shopkeepers Association

01:31.840 --> 01:33.680
monthly meeting this evening.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.520
I trust we'll see you there,
with your harpsichord.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.440
Erm... no, thank you.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.800
There will be sandwiches.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.080
I went to one meeting ten years ago,

01:43.080 --> 01:45.440
they were wittering on
about the Christmas lights

01:45.440 --> 01:48.280
and passed a resolution
condemning the improper use

01:48.280 --> 01:50.760
of apostrophes on signs in windows.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.320
There is literally nothing
that would get me there tonight.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.760
I see...

01:55.360 --> 01:56.240
Very well.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.880
You leave me with no alternative.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.120
I have... at the back of my bookshop...

02:04.160 --> 02:07.760
a 1965 <i>Doctor Who Annual</i>.

02:09.320 --> 02:12.800
There was no 1965 <i>Doctor Who Annual.</i>

02:13.240 --> 02:16.440
The first one was covered in 1966.
Publish--

02:16.560 --> 02:18.360
September 1965.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.360
The 1965 Annual was indeed never printed,

02:21.360 --> 02:23.120
due to problems at the BBC.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.760
Mine...

02:25.520 --> 02:28.360
is the only known proof copy.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.160
You'll let me look at it?

02:32.160 --> 02:36.120
If you are at the meeting this evening,
with perhaps a quartet of musicians?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.400
I'll let you have it.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.760
You just did what I think you did?

02:46.760 --> 02:47.960
I'm not prepared to talk about it.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.320
- You gave away a book.
- I had to.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.240
Maggie and Nina are depending on me.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.960
They just don't know it yet.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.760
A thousand...

02:59.360 --> 03:00.800
blood-thirsty demons.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.680
We are in Hell.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.600
I have authorization from Beelzebub.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.200
You can have authorization
from Satan himself love,

03:12.200 --> 03:14.000
if I don't have them
I can't send them over.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.000
I'll give you a malignant
and creeping sense of unease if you like.

03:17.480 --> 03:18.840
Why would I want a creep?

03:20.040 --> 03:21.040
Five hundred.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.560
There must be 500 foot soldiers.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.640
What they for?

03:25.880 --> 03:27.040
Attacking a bookshop.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.040
Don't tell anybody,
but we may be battling angels.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.720
I'll do you 100.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.920
- What's--
- It has just dropped to 70.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.000
I'll take them.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.240
Hello.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.280
What can I do you gentleman for?

03:58.280 --> 04:01.600
It's about the monthly
shopkeepers meeting, tonight.

04:01.600 --> 04:06.000
Under no circumstances
can I there be for tonight.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.520
It is my wedding anniversary

04:08.520 --> 04:11.480
and I am taking
my beloved spouse out to dinner.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.360
I have a first edition

04:18.360 --> 04:22.360
of S. W. Erdnase's
Expert at the Card Table.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.800
- You've got a first edition?
- It was Erdnase's own copy.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.240
He signed it with his real name.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.240
And annotated it.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.160
- How much?
- It's not for sale.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.360
However...

04:45.800 --> 04:48.360
if you come to the meeting tonight,

04:49.320 --> 04:50.640
I might be willing

04:51.640 --> 04:52.920
to lend it to you.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.440
I'll tell the spouse something came up

04:56.440 --> 04:58.080
Bring them along too.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.640
I can promise you,
it will be quite a night.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.240
Hello, Ms. Cheng.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.800
There is a meeting tonight...

05:14.920 --> 05:16.360
The Street Traders?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.240
Yes, Mr. Cheng and I will be there.
What time does it start?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.760
6:30.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.120
See you there! Have a good day!

05:32.520 --> 05:33.640
Greetings.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.720
Listen to me now.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.200
Oh, legions of hell.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.360
Our mission...

05:43.920 --> 05:44.920
Excuse me?

05:46.280 --> 05:47.520
What is it?

05:48.760 --> 05:49.760
Erm...

05:51.080 --> 05:52.240
A legion is like,

05:53.000 --> 05:54.480
about 6,000 demons.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.960
Yes, I know.

06:01.320 --> 06:05.120
Tonight, we launch an attack,

06:06.520 --> 06:10.040
unprecedented in its audacity,

06:10.040 --> 06:13.960
unique in its...

06:14.360 --> 06:15.480
Yes, what?

06:15.480 --> 06:17.720
Technically, we're only about...

06:18.160 --> 06:19.760
one seventy-fifth of a legion.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.520
I know,

06:21.520 --> 06:24.280
but what we lack in numbers,

06:24.280 --> 06:27.920
we make up for in ferocity.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.280
And...

06:31.240 --> 06:33.040
- Scariness?
- No.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.080
Lost it now.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.080
Ferocity and...

06:40.800 --> 06:42.280
danger!

06:43.240 --> 06:44.360
Ascertain,

06:44.800 --> 06:48.640
for we are demons
and they are but poultry humans.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.920
So we're not going up
against Angels, then?

06:52.200 --> 06:54.040
Because he said
we were going up against Angels.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.960
- Who said that?
- Fofo.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.240
- Is it true?
- We are going to Earth.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.240
To London.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.840
To storm a bookshop.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.000
Mr. Phale, I speak fluent English.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.960
I've been living here for 15 years.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.080
<i>Excellent.</i>

07:22.800 --> 07:24.480
Well... Erm...

07:44.640 --> 07:47.000
Mr. Phale, if it's about
the street traders meeting,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.360
I can be there, but only until seven,

07:49.360 --> 07:51.640
as we start to get really busy then.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.360
Yes, 6:30. See you there.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.440
So you can guarantee no Angels, then?

08:08.320 --> 08:11.600
Some of those Angels
are right dangerous bastards.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.800
We could be permanently discorporated.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.920
What I can guarantee you,

08:16.920 --> 08:18.640
sunshine,

08:18.640 --> 08:22.040
is, if you interrupt me one more time,

08:22.960 --> 08:25.120
you will regret it forever.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.240
Understood?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.040
You speak every language in the world,

08:34.040 --> 08:35.400
- we both do.
- Yes.

08:36.280 --> 08:40.120
- So what's with the French?
- Oh, I learned that, pfft... the hard way.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.520
I went to Monsieur Rossignol's
night classes in 1760.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.720
You don't have an aunt, she doesn't have
a gardener, he doesn't have a pen.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.360
But you understood me.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.160
Only because for 250 years
you've been wittering on about

08:58.160 --> 09:00.480
the plume of your imaginary taunt.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.400
Bravo. Just enjoying the show.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.080
Ah. Erm...

09:05.760 --> 09:08.640
Street Association meeting
tonight at 6:30 in my shop,

09:08.760 --> 09:11.960
perfectly ordinary invitation
with no hidden agenda of any kind.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.520
Are they going to talk about the Christmas
lights? Because I have things to say.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.720
- Yes.
- I'll be there.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.520
He's never hosted a meeting, ever.
Why the change of heart?

09:26.520 --> 09:27.880
He's unpredictable.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.960
He's discovered his civic obligations.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.640
You've been together long?

09:33.720 --> 09:35.520
- Who?
- You and your partner.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.760
Oh, no, no, it's not...
it's not like that.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.840
It certainly looks like that from here.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.440
Oh so you've just recently hooked up.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.960
- No, we...
- You got a husband?

09:43.960 --> 09:45.840
Or a boyfriend? Is the book selling
your bit on the side?

09:46.360 --> 09:48.200
He's not my bit on the side.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.640
I'm far too pure of heart
to be anybody's bit on the side.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.160
- He's just an angel, I know.
- If you say so.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.200
But then again, other people's love lives

09:57.200 --> 09:59.120
always seem so much more
straightforward than our own.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.120
We leave at nightfall.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Masks will be provided
for those who can't...

10:21.760 --> 10:23.160
blend in.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.520
We use the big transporter.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.520
- Erm...
- What? What is it?

10:34.480 --> 10:36.120
The big transporter is out of service.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.440
We'll have to use
the little transporter, one at a time.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.400
Or take the stairs.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.080
We take the stairs.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.680
Do you want a glass?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.880
I'm at work and I have a meeting.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.440
I need to prepare for--
why don't you wait inside?

12:49.560 --> 12:51.720
- You like waiting inside.
- I don't think so.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.680
You've got an amnesiac Archangel
hiding out in your bookshop.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.400
I spent last night worrying
if he's going to wake up.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.680
What if he remembers who he is,
what if he's faking it?

13:01.440 --> 13:04.640
He could smite me.
When Gabriel smites you, you've been...

13:06.960 --> 13:09.200
- Smited? Smut?
- Smitten.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.680
I believe. You're being silly.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.960
It's perfectly safe. He's not...

13:14.800 --> 13:18.200
you know who, any long---
well, I mean, he is, but...

13:19.840 --> 13:21.640
Have you thought of just talking to him?

13:25.120 --> 13:27.160
Actually, I will.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.480
Fuck!

14:14.640 --> 14:15.880
Let there be light.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.200
Hello, Gabriel.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.080
Neat.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.960
- But I'm--
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.200
You're Jim now.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.880
Got everything just the way you wanted?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.960
Oh, yes, Mr. Phale's been very good to me.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.640
Hasn't he just? Surprising, really,

14:40.560 --> 14:42.560
given that the last time you two met

14:44.000 --> 14:45.800
you tried to destroy him.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.960
- I-- I don't remember that.
- No, Jim? Oh.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.400
Well, Mr. Phale
doesn't remember it either.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.720
He wasn't there, you see.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.280
- He wasn't there?
- Long story, but...

15:03.280 --> 15:04.440
I was there.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.720
And I do remember,

15:08.200 --> 15:12.960
oh, very clearly,
the look on your face, Archangel Gabriel.

15:14.880 --> 15:20.560
When you told my only friend
to shut his stupid mouth and die.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.200
And I...

15:25.960 --> 15:27.120
did not...

15:27.120 --> 15:28.960
care for it.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.160
I don't think that was me,

15:32.360 --> 15:33.520
but I'm very sorry.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.520
I hope I'm not causing
too much trouble now.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.440
More bad news for you then, Jimmy boy.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.320
You're making him risk
his entire existence

15:44.320 --> 15:46.000
- for you.
- Oh, dear.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.160
I really am sorry.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.760
- Is there anything I can do?
- Oh, yeah.

15:51.720 --> 15:52.760
Now.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.920
Jump out of that window.

15:56.800 --> 15:57.800
All right.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.320
Stop!

16:12.880 --> 16:14.960
Ugh, get down.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.680
Well, if you're really not him,

16:20.120 --> 16:21.280
what are you?

16:21.920 --> 16:24.320
I don't know, I feel...

16:25.520 --> 16:26.520
like,

16:27.480 --> 16:28.560
an empty...

16:29.040 --> 16:30.440
- house.
- A house?

16:30.440 --> 16:33.520
Yes, a house someone lived
for a very long time,

16:33.840 --> 16:35.400
but now they're gone

16:35.880 --> 16:38.160
and the house can sort of tell
where the things used to be.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.160
Like when I remembered how it all began.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.720
When you first arrived,
you said you were here

16:44.720 --> 16:48.080
because they were planning
to do something terrible to you.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.600
So you remembered it then.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.240
Remember it now.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.360
It hurts to remember.
My head isn't built for that.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.000
I know, do it anyway.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.760
- It's not, I don't have my memory.
- Well, where is your memory, then?

17:08.440 --> 17:09.960
In a matchbox.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.240
No, I took it out, first.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.760
- You took your memory out of a matchbox?
- Yes, that's right.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.560
I took it out and I put it in the box
and I brought it here.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.080
- And it's...
- Yes?

17:25.200 --> 17:28.160
- Everywhere.
- Ah, what else do you remember?

17:31.760 --> 17:35.680
If it happens again I can make it seem
like it's an institutional problem.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.760
- What?
- I don't know, I'm just...

17:38.760 --> 17:41.960
I know, looking at
where the furniture isn't.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.200
Do you...

17:53.320 --> 17:55.080
want a hot chocolate?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.720
So what have you learnt about the miracle?

18:05.720 --> 18:09.080
I'm in the process of verifying it,
but, of course,

18:09.080 --> 18:12.400
you can only tell if people are in love
by waiting a few days,

18:12.400 --> 18:14.880
because humans are weird
and that's how it works.

18:14.880 --> 18:18.160
I knew that. Any leads on Gabriel?

18:18.160 --> 18:20.160
Oh, right. Well...

18:20.800 --> 18:22.320
he's definitely not in the shop.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.720
Does that count as a lead?
It is just Aziraphale.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.520
- The traitor?
- Yes.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.560
He seemed very...

18:31.000 --> 18:32.480
- Traitorous.
- Hmm...

18:32.480 --> 18:35.080
- And his grumpy friend, Mr. Crowley.
- The demon.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.560
Oh, I suppose that
explains the grumpiness.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.960
Oh, and, of course, his...

18:40.880 --> 18:41.880
assistant?

18:42.400 --> 18:46.000
- But I don't think I saw him.
- His assistant?

18:47.800 --> 18:50.080
- He doesn't have an assistant.
- No.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.080
Sorry, I don't know why I said that.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.960
Does he? Does he?

18:54.960 --> 18:57.920
Didn't we meet a someone, something...

18:58.520 --> 19:01.920
- about... books?
- No, no.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.080
Aziraphale himself, he likes books.

19:05.800 --> 19:06.800
Yes.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.320
Of course.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.680
Yes?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.480
I don't know if it helps, but...

19:12.480 --> 19:14.320
at one point Mr. Phale and Mr...

19:14.320 --> 19:16.720
I mean, the traitor and the demon,

19:17.320 --> 19:19.720
had a secret meeting
about what to do next.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.760
Ah.

19:21.640 --> 19:22.560
And?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.720
- What?
- What did they say?

19:26.720 --> 19:30.320
Oh, I didn't listen.
They said it was private.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
Thank you.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.560
- You're really nice.
- Don't thank me.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.400
And I'm not.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.280
Oh, nobody would believe you anyway.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.320
- What are you doing?
- Just making space for...

20:08.920 --> 20:10.560
everything that needs to happen.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.520
You're up to something, I can smell it.
What are you planning?

20:13.520 --> 20:14.680
Wait and see.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.640
Wait and see? Do you have
any idea how irritating that is?

20:17.640 --> 20:20.000
Yes, now, if you're going to
stand here and just carp,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.080
perhaps you could check in
on Nina or Maggie

20:22.080 --> 20:24.160
and make sure they are on their way.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.880
I don't know why you invited me,
Mr. Phale.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.560
Well, you are a Whickber Street trader,
Mrs. Sandwich.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.720
- And a pillar of the community.
- That's as may be.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.560
But it's the after work rush and the
several regulars gonna need seeing to.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.800
I'm sure you young ladies
know what to do by now.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.560
- Well, if you put it like that.
- I've never asked,

21:19.960 --> 21:22.560
what exactly is it that they do do?

21:23.960 --> 21:25.720
They stand on their own two feet.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.760
Like the government said.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.280
Ah.

21:35.800 --> 21:40.080
Just here to tell you the Street Traders
Association meeting is starting now.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.920
I never miss a meeting, I'll be there.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.080
Not a problem.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.440
Seats? Mr. Phale, where are the seats
I dropped off for the meeting?

21:55.440 --> 21:57.080
- No point.
- No point?

21:57.080 --> 21:59.680
We'd only have to move them away again
when the dancing begins, wouldn't we?

21:59.680 --> 22:01.040
Better to keep them for later.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.520
Dancing?

22:11.280 --> 22:13.400
"Give me coffee or give me death"

22:13.400 --> 22:14.880
Funny name for a coffee shop.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.480
Everything else was taken,
what do you want?

22:16.480 --> 22:19.040
- Just to remind you about the...
- The meeting? I'm not coming.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.720
- You have to.
- No, I don't. My...

22:22.880 --> 22:24.720
My partner, Lindsay, has texted

22:25.240 --> 22:27.040
and it's now my former partner.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.400
And I'm buggered if I'm gonna talk about
the stupid Christmas lights tonight,

22:30.400 --> 22:33.000
so I'm going home and gonna drink
myself senseless and have a good cry.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.800
- in an empty flat.
- Don't do that.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.600
- Why not?
- It may not be safe. Something's going on.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.280
Something's wrong.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.720
Well, lots of things are wrong right now,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.960
but right now it's coming in waves.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.320
- Like a hangover.
- I'm going home.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.840
You'd be safer in there. My friend
wouldn't let anything happen to you.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.800
Jeez, for once
in your life trust somebody.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.240
- You're weird.
- Arg, do it!

23:08.440 --> 23:09.520
I'm going mad.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.040
For my dear, it is Nina,
purveyor of coffee for all our needs.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.800
Charmed, I'm sure.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.320
Ah, <i>bonsoir</i>. It is,
how do you say, a fine night for dancing.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.520
Justine, what's going on?

23:19.520 --> 23:22.320
Why, our good mistress coffee seller.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.600
Tonight is a meeting
of the Whickber Street Traders

23:24.600 --> 23:26.360
and shopkeepers Association.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.560
We all are partaking
of the hospitality of Mr. Phale.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.520
Hello, would you like to try one of these
tiny little dinners? They are free.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.760
Ah, Nina!

23:39.760 --> 23:43.440
Oh, I'm so glad you are here.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.200
The dancing is about to begin.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.560
I know I'm really upset,
why don't I feel upset?

23:48.560 --> 23:50.800
Ah, no long faces tonight.

23:51.160 --> 23:54.760
I just want to see you
young people enjoying yourselves.

23:54.760 --> 23:55.840
Dancing?

23:55.840 --> 23:58.680
Well, it wouldn't be
a Shopkeepers Association meeting

23:58.680 --> 24:00.040
without dancing, would it?

24:00.040 --> 24:02.520
Look, I don't know what's going on but
your friend said I was in danger

24:02.520 --> 24:04.880
and now I'm in here
and you're all acting...

24:05.400 --> 24:08.120
- And I'm losing my fucking mind.
- Well, now you're here,

24:08.800 --> 24:12.240
that's the main thing.
You're definitely safe

24:12.840 --> 24:14.040
in here.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.720
Excellent eventide to you, mistress Nina,

24:16.720 --> 24:19.080
I trust we'll tread a measure together

24:19.080 --> 24:21.520
before tonight's
Shopkeepers Association meeting is over.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.640
I just wanted to talk
about the Christmas lights

24:45.680 --> 24:46.840
Who are you?

24:47.240 --> 24:48.560
Who sent you?

24:51.400 --> 24:52.760
You're demons.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.600
Junior bottom of the barrel demons,

24:54.600 --> 24:55.840
practically the damp.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.680
What are you doing here?
What are any of you doing here?

25:00.080 --> 25:02.800
You can't just manifest
and cause trouble, there are rules.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.040
- Give us the Angel.
- We want Gabriel.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.200
You are out of order!

25:26.000 --> 25:27.840
What exactly is your profession?

25:29.160 --> 25:30.560
I'm a seamstress.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.760
Indeed a worthy craft.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.600
No, I'm not a seamstress.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.040
I'm a seamstress.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.440
The devil take it.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.600
- A seamstress.
- What, in short?

25:45.200 --> 25:48.080
- You are a seamstress.
- No, I'm not a benighted seamstress.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.880
I'm a God forsaken...

25:50.520 --> 25:52.560
seamstress.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.960
Why can I not say
the word seamstress.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.240
Perhaps if you were to
describe the profession.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.360
Nah, the very thing, I thank you.

26:00.880 --> 26:03.840
Well, when a gentleman finds himself

26:03.840 --> 26:06.240
in want of
the tender attentions of a wife,

26:06.760 --> 26:09.240
he may take himself to my establishment

26:09.760 --> 26:13.880
and there have his pick
of a fine stable of ladies

26:14.200 --> 26:17.320
all able and willing to mend his shirt

26:18.040 --> 26:19.800
or darn his socks

26:19.800 --> 26:22.520
or even... sew on a button.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.960
But that's extra, and all the girls do it.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.320
Oh.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.920
A seamstress.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.760
- What are you doing?
- I told you.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.520
Jane Austen. We're having a Ball.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.760
I've gotta talk to you, it's important.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.440
I'm afraid I'm hosting a business meeting,

27:03.440 --> 27:05.320
I'll be with you
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.480
Have a vol-au-vent.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.040
- This is something new.
- This is something completely bonkers.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.520
Why is everyone talking like
they just came from <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>?

27:36.520 --> 27:38.920
Just getting into
the spirit of things, I suppose.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.280
Spirit of what things?

27:40.280 --> 27:42.640
This is meant to be the Shopkeepers
Association monthly meeting.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.640
Oh, yes.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.560
Well, when you put it like that.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.920
Are we dancing?

27:49.520 --> 27:50.640
Yes.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.760
Did you ever learn
the steps to this dance?

27:52.760 --> 27:54.800
It's just what we do, isn't it?

27:54.800 --> 27:57.040
No. No, it isn't.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.000
This is something mad.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.400
This is their fault.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.360
They are doing this.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.400
I am an assistant book seller,
these are not books.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.920
They are good old pieces of food
and I am not selling them,

28:42.280 --> 28:43.600
I'm giving them away.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.640
Then most certainly
we must indulge ourselves.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.240
Oh.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.240
Oh, great...

28:51.680 --> 28:53.440
We shall want another one presently.

28:53.920 --> 28:58.360
It is seldom indeed that our little
village has the fortune to welcome one so

28:58.800 --> 29:03.600
amiable, so gentile and,
if you'll allow me sir, so well made,

29:03.600 --> 29:05.720
in form and feature.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.080
This, it's neat,

29:09.440 --> 29:11.560
isn't it? I'm still working out
all the things it can do.

29:11.920 --> 29:15.200
I discovered a new one in bed last night.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.760
Would you like me to show you?

29:17.960 --> 29:20.800
I must confess you interests us strangely.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.440
Here, here, watch, watch, watch.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.960
Making a blend is one thing,
but a Ball with,

29:42.560 --> 29:45.040
look there's something wrong.
There is something really wrong.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.280
Well, perhaps you could tell me

29:47.040 --> 29:48.160
while we dance.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.560
We don't dance.

30:01.480 --> 30:03.800
<i>Doors opening. Earth.</i>

30:19.680 --> 30:20.720
How sweet.

30:21.760 --> 30:22.960
They're having a party.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.120
- What do we do?
- I'm not sure.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.560
Not having a very good day.
My partner, Lindsay,

30:30.120 --> 30:31.120
has gone.

30:31.800 --> 30:32.920
Was it my fault?

30:32.920 --> 30:34.800
What? No.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.800
Not really.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.120
That night was the last straw of...

30:40.120 --> 30:41.920
it's been coming for a long time.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.000
I don't think Lindsay
actually liked me very much.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.800
- And, well, I know I'm hard work.
- I...

30:53.040 --> 30:54.040
I mean...

30:54.800 --> 30:56.360
I'm not afraid of hard work.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.720
Hell has sent demons.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.600
They are milling around outside,
they want Gabriel.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.880
We're perfectly safe in here.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.480
Technically, this bookshop
still counts as an embassy.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.280
I think you need to stop this charade

31:10.280 --> 31:12.080
and we need to work out what to do.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.400
I am not giving them Jim.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.320
People will get hurt, angel.

31:17.920 --> 31:21.040
I think you're overestimating
how much trouble we're actually in.

31:28.640 --> 31:29.680
Well...

31:30.280 --> 31:31.400
Oh.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.000
Oh, dear.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.520
-"Surrender the Angle."
- Yeah, erm...

31:36.520 --> 31:39.000
Spelling not their strong point,
they meant to say...

31:39.000 --> 31:40.480
Surrender the Angel.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.080
Send out Gabriel.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.520
- Nobody gets too badly hurt.
- Out of the question.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.560
Might I remind you,

31:47.560 --> 31:51.280
that this bookshop is technically
an independent embassy.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.520
Being a former outpost of Heaven,

31:53.520 --> 31:56.440
- and as such--
- You're an outlaw Aziraphale.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.280
You have no protection.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.880
I have a legion of demons

32:01.240 --> 32:02.400
by my side.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.000
And I have no intention of harming you,

32:06.560 --> 32:08.640
only the humans here with you.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.080
You have 60 seconds
to hand over the Archangel Gabriel

32:13.080 --> 32:16.640
before we begin to kill people.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.280
Excuse me.

32:26.840 --> 32:27.880
Fifty seconds.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.840
What do you say?

32:30.360 --> 32:31.760
This is all because of me, isn't it?

32:32.400 --> 32:34.360
Those people want me,

32:34.840 --> 32:35.880
don't they?

32:40.080 --> 32:41.080
You came to me,

32:41.800 --> 32:43.200
I said I would protect you,

32:44.160 --> 32:45.240
and I will.

32:45.720 --> 32:46.920
You don't need to.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.600
I'm going out.

32:59.000 --> 32:59.960
I'm here.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.560
I'm who you want.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.440
I think.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.160
It's me.

33:07.080 --> 33:10.520
I don't know what you're doing,
but you're in my way.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.680
Send out the Angel now,
or everyone in the bookshop gets it.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.160
- I mean it!
- Hi.

33:18.640 --> 33:19.880
Listen.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.240
The Angel Gabriel is...

33:24.040 --> 33:26.080
apparently, me.

33:26.080 --> 33:29.760
But I'm also Jim, which is short
for James, but also Gabriel.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.640
Will you shut up?

33:34.880 --> 33:39.040
Get back in there right now, this minute.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.440
And you tell that ass Aziraphale

33:43.440 --> 33:46.800
and that arch traitor Crowley

33:46.800 --> 33:50.360
that unless they send out
the Angel Gabriel now,

33:50.360 --> 33:52.240
they are toast.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.320
T-O-S-T

33:56.800 --> 33:58.040
E.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.080
Toast. Now.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
What happened?

34:16.480 --> 34:20.800
They told me to come back
and tell you to send out the Angel.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.640
Of course they did.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.080
Ah. We needed a miracle
to make sure nobody know it's him.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.120
Now nobody knows it's him.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.280
- Nice one, ass.
- Excuse me, Mr. Phale.

34:31.640 --> 34:34.160
Who are these people? What's happening?

34:34.280 --> 34:36.200
Twenty seconds, Angel,

34:36.840 --> 34:39.400
before we start hurting them.

34:39.880 --> 34:43.120
You aren't allowed
to harm humans directly,

34:43.120 --> 34:45.080
- you know that Shacks.
- Maybe not.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.400
But I can harm them indirectly.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.400
We can definitely hurt them
whilst battling Angels.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.080
There'll be civilian casualties.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.600
Oh, oh, are you saying
this is officially sanctioned.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.960
that this attack is consistent
with the rules of engagement.

34:56.960 --> 35:01.040
Well, is it or isn't it? Were you given
official permission to launch this attack?

35:03.960 --> 35:05.560
I'm not stupid.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.840
I have the permission.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.520
Standard rules of engagement,
clause 1.1.2, subsection 3.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.360
Civilian non-competence
must be given sufficient time

35:13.360 --> 35:15.080
to evacuate the area of hostilities.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.440
Aziraphale can put in a formal complaint

35:17.440 --> 35:19.320
to the dark council of
the dukes of Hell, if you want.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.400
But you'll have to delay your attack
until they reply.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.440
That could take weeks, maybe. Erm...

35:24.440 --> 35:26.800
You lot could all be in big trouble.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.160
Get your...

35:34.640 --> 35:36.880
humans out of there, then.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.480
Sure.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.640
Right, I just made up a rule
that they're too stupid to check.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.480
I'm gonna get the humans out of here
and then I'm coming back.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.760
- I won't leave you on your own.
- I know, but I have a suggestion.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.880
I've got this. Right,
I'm gonna take you all out of here.

35:49.880 --> 35:54.120
If you do exactly what I tell you,
nobody is going to get hurt.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.800
I don't know what's actually going on
but I am going to deal with it.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.600
- Excuse me.
- Oh, that might get messy.

35:59.600 --> 36:00.760
Oh...

36:06.320 --> 36:07.120
Madam.

36:10.480 --> 36:12.920
I don't know why
you think it's appropriate to disrupt

36:12.920 --> 36:15.760
a meeting of the Whickber Street
Traders and Shopkeepers Association.

36:15.760 --> 36:16.880
Dance.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.760
Not a meeting.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.440
You were dancing.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.680
You had no right
to interfere with these people.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.200
Right.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.800
I'm calling the Emergency Services.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.120
Crowley, what's
the boundary line of this place?

36:34.120 --> 36:35.840
The door frame, you can't cross it.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.920
- You can't do that.
- We just did.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.640
Civilian casualty.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.960
Get the rest of them out now,

36:49.960 --> 36:51.640
or we'll take them one at a time.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.760
I still don't understand.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.840
- What's happening?
- Erm...

37:00.640 --> 37:02.600
It's a bit complicated, but...

37:03.040 --> 37:07.280
probably best if you forget all about it
and do whatever Mr. Crowley suggests.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.200
Are you trying to hypnotize me,
is that what's happening here?

37:10.320 --> 37:12.600
- You're doing something to us.
- I'm trying to save your lives.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.640
Right, everyone line up.
Two by two.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.760
I was Mrs. Sandwich out from the main.
Nina, Maggie, you take the rear.

37:17.760 --> 37:18.880
Maggie, come on.

37:18.880 --> 37:21.040
I'm not leaving him
to face them on his own.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.960
When I say walk,

37:23.800 --> 37:25.480
you know, walk.
Don't make eye contact with them,

37:25.480 --> 37:27.120
just follow me out.
Nina, are you coming?

37:30.440 --> 37:31.640
No.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.960
You're saying behind to die bravely?

37:33.640 --> 37:35.840
Good on you. Right, save lives.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.320
Have you got your hand in?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.480
- I've got more than that, love.
- Oh, I bet you do.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.560
Let's go.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.520
Happy anniversary, love.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.560
I brought him out.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.280
- Why?
- It stacks up by the front door.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.840
Keep it for now, not a good time.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.480
- They took him.
- Is he all right?

38:01.480 --> 38:05.440
Unlikely.
Let's all get safely outside and see.

38:16.040 --> 38:19.640
Right, I'm gonna formally declare
this meeting of the Whickber Street

38:20.000 --> 38:22.080
shopkeepers, thingy over.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.920
I think it'd be best if you headed back
to your shops as fast as possible

38:24.920 --> 38:28.440
and, well, forget
as much of this as you can.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.560
You're a good lad.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.640
I'm not actually, either.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.560
But thank you.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.880
- Why didn't you go?
- I wanna know what's happening.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.960
- You're in danger.
- None of this makes sense.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.320
You're in trouble
and we're not leaving you on your own.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.120
We aren't in danger.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.600
Crowley will be back in a moment,
he will have a plan.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.880
Why don't you stand up for yourself?
Make your own plans.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.440
I am, but rescuing me makes him so happy.

39:06.880 --> 39:09.160
Officer, I need to report a crime.

39:09.560 --> 39:13.480
- Oh, err, I think I'm... the wrong--
- You're a law enforcement officer?

39:13.480 --> 39:15.480
Yes, I mean, well, probably--

39:15.480 --> 39:17.360
As a law enforcement officer,
you are able to arrest someone

39:17.360 --> 39:19.960
- if a crime has been committed.
- Well, yes, but--

39:19.960 --> 39:22.320
- Good, then arrest me.
- What?

39:22.320 --> 39:24.840
Like I said,
put on the cuffs, I'll go quietly.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.520
This is very difficult,
but I'm not actually

39:29.520 --> 39:31.960
Inspector Constable,
a human law enforcement officer.

39:31.960 --> 39:35.000
You're an Angel, I know,
that's why I'm surrendering to you.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.520
I'm a demon,
with knowledge of a crime against Heaven,

39:37.520 --> 39:40.160
I demand that you arrest me,
we don't have much time.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.600
But, how would I...?

39:41.600 --> 39:44.040
You say "I arrest you, anything you say
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.280
- Blah, blah, blah?
- Good job, you're arresting me.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.640
- What?
- Yeah, you said "bla, bla, bla."

39:48.920 --> 39:51.040
It's all right, officer,
I'll come quietly.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.480
Come where?

39:53.280 --> 39:54.480
Heaven.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.120
Right.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.280
<i>Doors opening.</i>

40:10.800 --> 40:13.120
You aren't trying to trick me, are you?

40:13.120 --> 40:16.040
You're arresting me,
why would I be trying to trick you?

40:20.480 --> 40:21.680
Close the doors.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.680
<i>Doors closing.</i>

40:28.560 --> 40:30.800
<i>Going up.</i>
