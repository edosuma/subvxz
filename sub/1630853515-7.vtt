Herman says that Lily Flower
has to be wicked sexy.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.097
Otherwise, she'll be
overshadowed by Irma Vep.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.224
-And we don't want that.
-Oh, no, we don't.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.392
Mm-mm.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.229
Zoe:
What do you think?

02:26.312 --> 02:30.275
-Too much?
-Mm... I don't think so.

02:30.358 --> 02:33.570
I like her like this.
She's bad.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.197

-Yes.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.909

02:39.993 --> 02:42.745
So, oops, no. Yeah.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.664
Lovely. Show me

-(phone chimes)

Ooh.

-(phone dings)
-Ah.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.137
"Very happy.

"Makes the character

far more attractive."

03:02.849 --> 03:04.475
Herman has such
a different approach.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.270
-It's sort of fun.
-I miss René, though.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.730
This is his show.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.733
(sighs)
René's vanished.
What can we do?

03:11.816 --> 03:12.567
You know what?

03:12.650 --> 03:14.068
I bet he'll be back.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.070
René lives in
a different world.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.032
He has a vision,
he's overwhelmed by it.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.742
When he was younger,
he could handle it.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.744
Not anymore. Sad.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.537

03:30.835 --> 03:32.712
You bet.

I guess he's right.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.299
It's pretty dull
in the original.

03:36.382 --> 03:40.345
I know.
But I found an expert...

03:40.428 --> 03:43.348
-Ooh.
-...who taught me a few tricks.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.933
Do you have ropes?

03:45.016 --> 03:48.436
He says tape
makes it much easier.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.562
(chuckles)

03:49.646 --> 03:51.022
Grab that chair.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.774
-Zoe: This one?
-No, no, no.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.067
The one in the back.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.319
Okay, you are
Philippe Guérande.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.988
You are behind me,
but I don't notice you.

03:59.072 --> 04:03.993
But I will have to tie
your wrists first.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.161
Do it!

04:07.080 --> 04:10.959
Now you can, uh,
bind me to the chair.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.169
Around, yes.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.592
Zoe:
I'm gonna make

Oh.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.638
-(starts recording)
-Hello, Herman!

04:23.721 --> 04:25.181
Help!

04:25.264 --> 04:28.559
Au secours!
Au secours!

04:29.352 --> 04:30.770
Ah!

04:30.853 --> 04:32.814
Yo, check this out.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.068
-Help!
-Laurie: Oh, wow.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.487
I didn't expect Cynthia
to be into bondage.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.655
Yeah, well,
she's into anything

04:40.738 --> 04:42.323
that makes
her character stand out.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.783
-(video playing)
-Well, I mean,

04:43.866 --> 04:44.701
I don't blame her.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.370
-She looks amazing.
-Yeah.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.705
(chuckling)

04:48.788 --> 04:50.540
Are you sure you
don't want help?

04:50.623 --> 04:52.000
I can call a bellboy.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.378
Zoe:
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

04:55.461 --> 04:59.340
I've schlepped so
much worse in my time.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.801
-Cynthia: Good night.
-Zoe: Good night.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.225
Mira, what are
you doing here?

05:09.308 --> 05:12.311
I'm not sure I'm Mira.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.314
Sometimes, it's like
Irma Vep takes over.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.899
Who am I speaking to now?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.192
Both of us.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.527
Sit down,

05:19.610 --> 05:21.863
if that's something
ghosts do.

05:21.946 --> 05:25.742
Well, I'm not
exactly a ghost.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.287
How did you get in then?

05:29.370 --> 05:30.538
Powers.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.915
-Like?
-Like...

05:32.999 --> 05:35.251

05:35.334 --> 05:37.253
Impressive.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.755
Do you like Herman?

05:38.838 --> 05:40.882
Cynthia:
He's not my type
of director.

05:40.965 --> 05:44.761
-I like René.
-I miss him. It's his project.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.972
He lives and breathes it
in his own weird way.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.974
Cynthia:
Herman seems decent enough.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.393
I like the sexy twist
he's bringing to it.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.229
You mean the kink.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.482
-I guess.
-And the kink

05:57.565 --> 05:59.233
was there from the start.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.611
Herman's following
in René's footsteps,

06:01.694 --> 06:04.280
which is to his credit,
don't you think?

06:04.363 --> 06:06.699
-Want one?
-Hm.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.577
(yelps, chuckles)

06:09.660 --> 06:12.371
I felt a strange vibe
when you entered the room.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.415
You actresses are witches.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.292
-(chuckles)
-What about you?

06:16.375 --> 06:18.878
Me?
I'm not really
an actress.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.297
-I'm a singer.
-Not that different.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.801
-And you do seem
pretty confident on set.
-Mm.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.262
I write songs
about my feelings.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.640
Or about simple things
of everyday life.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.642
It's how I connect
to my audience.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.643
You feel that,

06:33.726 --> 06:36.395
that's... real life.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.815
-Yes.
-Whereas...

06:38.898 --> 06:42.568
making movies
is something else.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.445
Movies are fantasy,

06:44.529 --> 06:46.280
but you can't live
in a fantasy

06:46.364 --> 06:48.282
when the real world's
falling apart.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.119
No. The world is
constantly in flux,

06:51.202 --> 06:54.831
for... better or worse,
but we do need art.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.458
Are movies art?

06:57.542 --> 06:58.543
Sometimes.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.546
Cynthia:
I find them
mostly futile.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.839
Even "The Vampires"?

07:02.922 --> 07:06.008
(chuckles)
Who needs "The Vampires" 2022?

07:06.092 --> 07:09.637
-Seriously?
-Movies are a portal

07:09.720 --> 07:12.181
to some sort of spiritual world.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.933
René taught me that.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.977
I'm not sure I understand.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.688
Some sort of spiritual world

07:18.771 --> 07:21.315
we don't have access to anymore.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.984
Why is that?

07:23.067 --> 07:24.652
Mira:
We've lost our faith.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.655
Religion once connected us
to the world beyond.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.323
I'm a Buddhist.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.533
Have you always been?

07:30.616 --> 07:33.828
No, only the past
few years.

07:33.911 --> 07:37.331
But it's helped me
to detach from
the material world.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.334
That is what movies do.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.962
They detach us
from the material world.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.464
Most of 'em glorify
the material world.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.758
Mira:
Let me put it differently.

07:49.468 --> 07:52.597
They help us
question it.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.398
Laurie:
And you're leaving
just like that?

08:02.481 --> 08:06.360
-Without giving me a kiss?
-Oh, you know I was
gonna say goodbye.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.654
It's my good luck
piece right here.

08:11.782 --> 08:15.036
-Gotta teach these people

-Good luck, baby.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.168
A wishy-washy amateur.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.985

This is mainstream.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.613

I'm a Westerner.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.141
Actually, I'm Swedish.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.146
But I guess I've become
an American actress.

34:26.355 --> 34:28.191
Are you comfortable
with that?

34:28.274 --> 34:32.528
Swedish, American, whatever.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.030
Floating's fine by me.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.948
That's what
actors are about.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.910
But that's just me.
I was wondering if, um--

34:38.993 --> 34:40.119
If?

34:40.203 --> 34:41.871
Well...

34:41.954 --> 34:44.248
Irma Vep was
a Chinese character,

34:44.332 --> 34:47.794
and it's this whole
cultural appropriation
thing going on,

34:47.877 --> 34:50.713
and I'm not sure...
what to do with it.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.757
I'm not sure I'm on
the right side of it.

34:52.840 --> 34:53.925
I'm...

34:55.259 --> 34:57.053
not sure I'm doing
the right thing.

34:57.136 --> 35:02.475
Irma Vep is not exactly
a Chinese character.

35:02.558 --> 35:04.435
Well, you redefined it.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.521
I did what I could...

35:06.604 --> 35:09.524
without really knowing
where I was heading.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.901
-You want to know why?
-Sure.

35:11.984 --> 35:15.154
Because I've never
seen myself as a...

35:15.238 --> 35:17.490
Chinese actress.

35:17.573 --> 35:20.284
I grew up in the UK.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.663
My family is
from Shanghai.

35:23.746 --> 35:27.250
And I did most
of my movies
in Hong Kong.

35:27.333 --> 35:31.003
That gives layers
to my identity.

35:31.087 --> 35:33.589
It opens me to the world.

35:33.673 --> 35:37.343
And hopefully, it makes me
a better person.

35:37.426 --> 35:40.137
So, it's okay for me
to be Irma Vep.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.973
Yes, as long as you

35:42.056 --> 35:45.059
let yourself be
taken over by her.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.023
I need René.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.943
He needs to come back
and finish the series.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.071
Is that why you came?

35:57.154 --> 35:59.532

wanted me to do.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.247

36:06.330 --> 36:09.834
And you don't mind him
stealing your girlfriend?

36:09.917 --> 36:10.877
No.

36:11.878 --> 36:15.089
-I'm over it.
-I have my doubts.

36:15.172 --> 36:19.468
You stole Laurie's necklace,
so you think you're even.

36:19.552 --> 36:24.015
That was a stupid
thing to do. A whim.

36:24.098 --> 36:26.350
And in the end,
I got no pleasure from it.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.602
And no closure.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.730
Herman just doesn't get it.

36:30.813 --> 36:34.317

connection to Irma Vep.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.737
I feel it each time I'm her.

36:37.820 --> 36:42.241
He has to overcome his demons
and come and finish this show.
