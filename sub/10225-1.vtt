00:53.440 --> 00:56.910
It was my fault.
I was the one driving when it happened.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.469
After the accident, I started seeing things,
things that couldn't be real.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.919
But I'm not crazy.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.759
I know.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.269
Your father knows.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.356
Anyone who knows you knows that.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.038
<i>Look, Max, I've seen you every day
for the past two months.</i>

01:31.880 --> 01:36.271
<i>Maybe you're starting to let go
of your misplaced guilt.</i>

01:36.400 --> 01:40.154
<i>Maybe you're ready to stop blaming
yourself for what happened.</i>

01:41.680 --> 01:44.513
<i>But there's no one else to blame.</i>

01:51.240 --> 01:54.198
<i>It's gotten to the point
where I look in the mirror...</i>

01:55.440 --> 01:58.000
<i>and I'm not even sure
what's real anymore.</i>

05:53.920 --> 05:55.319
Fancy mirror.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.999
Later.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.596
You're a lady-killer, Schow.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.798
Lady-killer.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.872
What's goin' on?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.468
Hey! What-

07:16.280 --> 07:17.679
No!

08:24.360 --> 08:25.395
Yeah.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.669
Max.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.678
<i>- Who's this?
- Are you still sleeping? What time is it?</i>

08:29.800 --> 08:32.472
<i>- Dad? Is that you?
- Of course it's me.</i>

08:32.600 --> 08:34.397
<i>Yeah. Is everything all right?</i>

08:34.520 --> 08:37.717
Yeah. Did I wake you up?
You don't sound good.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.751
<i>- I'm fine. I'm just getting some sleep.
- Thank you.</i>

08:40.880 --> 08:42.198
Careful over there.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.118
<i>Just getting to the point where I can
sleep through the night again.</i>

08:45.240 --> 08:47.356
Good, good.
You gotta get your rest.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.596
- Keller.
- Yeah?

08:49.720 --> 08:52.598
- Five minutes.
- Okay, that's great.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.114
That is the Mayflower
signature right there.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.837
That glass has been through so much.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.916
You can see the care
that went into making it.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.918
Even the base came
from the original store.

09:06.040 --> 09:09.271
So that gives us the- its spirit.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.633
I think it's perfect.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.752
Look, Max, for the last two months
the police have been all over us...

09:14.880 --> 09:16.836
Iooking for that missing girl.

09:16.960 --> 09:20.157
Max, we may not be able
to open on time.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.032
<i>Really? I didn't know that, Dad.</i>

09:22.160 --> 09:24.879
And then last week
our night security guard goes crazy.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.309
He cuts himself up bad and he quits.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.915
<i>Max, I've got weeks of work to do
and two weeks out from opening.</i>

09:32.040 --> 09:33.996
<i>The last thing I need to be doing...</i>

09:34.120 --> 09:36.076
is looking for a new night watchman.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.954
<i>I'm just not sure I'm ready yet, Dad,
after all that's happened this year and-</i>

09:40.080 --> 09:42.719
Max. This is what you need.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.274
<i>And, honestly,
right now I need you, Max.</i>

09:45.400 --> 09:47.834
<i>I know it'll help you
take your mind off things.</i>

09:47.960 --> 09:49.598
<i>- Yeah.
- Look.</i>

09:49.720 --> 09:53.076
<i>- I think it's gonna be good.
- All right, Dad. I'll do it.</i>

09:54.040 --> 09:56.235
Thanks for the opportunity.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.989
<i>No, no, no, thank you, Max.
I tell you what.</i>

10:00.120 --> 10:03.556
Why don't you come in to work
a little early and find me...

10:03.680 --> 10:06.638
<i>so that we can say hello
before you clock in. Okay?</i>

10:06.760 --> 10:09.797
<i>- Yeah. Sure. I'll come find you.
- All right.</i>

10:09.920 --> 10:11.751
<i>- We'll see you in a little bit.
- Okay, Dad.</i>

10:11.880 --> 10:13.836
<i>- Bye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

10:36.840 --> 10:38.432
Shoot.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.519
I got it.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.036
Just trying to help.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.190
That may or may not be the case...

11:04.320 --> 11:08.438
but you should put that on your punch list,
then take care of that first thing tomorrow.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.515
Would you do that?

11:09.640 --> 11:13.872
Jenna, will you take care
of the accessories? That'll be great.

11:16.920 --> 11:20.310
Ladies and gentlemen, the thing
I am most proud of in the entire store.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.874
- This is my son Max.
- Hi.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.638
- How are ya, son?
- Good.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.318
Yeah? Get some rest?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.237
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.112
I wanna introduce you
to a few people.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.673
This is Keller Landreaux.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.519
He's gonna be our store manager
when we open in a few weeks.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.791
Keller told us that we could buy
property down here in New Orleans...

11:37.920 --> 11:39.717
for a song and a dime.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.957
That's exactly what we did.
Smart man.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.718
Glad to meet you, Max.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.513
My pleasure.
Thanks for having me.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.712
And this beautiful young lady
we have right here...

11:50.840 --> 11:53.115
this is Jenna McCarty.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.992
Jenna is the head buyer
for the store...

11:55.120 --> 11:58.078
and she has promised to bring us
a little bit of that Fifth Avenue flair...

11:58.200 --> 11:59.792
to Bourbon Street, yes?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.115
Sure.
Nice to meet you, Max.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.195
You too.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.949
You know, Max,
ladies love a man in uniform.

12:07.080 --> 12:12.473
Yeah, Dad, I'm sure the polyester pants
really help seal the deal.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.554
And last but not least
I'd like to introduce you to Ryan P-

12:17.680 --> 12:19.318
- What was your last name?
- Parker.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.637
I'm just kidding you. Ryan Parker,
our vice president in charge of operations.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.591
- Good to meet you, Max.
- Likewise.

12:24.720 --> 12:28.429
While you're out there on your rounds,
you see something that doesn't look right...

12:28.560 --> 12:31.632
you got a problem
with plumbing or electric, fire...

12:31.760 --> 12:35.355
you get a candy bar stuck
in the vending machine, you call Ryan.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.835
That's after you call me.

12:39.480 --> 12:43.029
Listen. I'm gonna let you go.
I know you got a job to do.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.470
And we need to continue on our rounds.
Good luck out there.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.158
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.077
Shall we?

14:10.800 --> 14:12.916
You all right?

14:13.040 --> 14:15.190
Sorry. First night.

14:27.720 --> 14:31.395
So, Max, you say you've been
having those visions again?

14:31.520 --> 14:32.748
Yeah.

14:33.880 --> 14:38.112
Were you taking drugs or had you been
drinking when you had this episode?

14:38.240 --> 14:42.199
No. It was last night at my new job.

14:42.320 --> 14:46.916
I saw a woman
in one of the mirrors at my work.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.870
You saw a woman?

14:50.000 --> 14:53.197
Yeah. She was looking back at me
from the other side.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.629
Her reflection looked like a corpse.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.916
She probably reminded you
of Kayla in some way.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.510
Your mind's way of
processing the mental shock.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.515
And the pills I prescribed?

15:09.200 --> 15:11.589
Yeah, I took one.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.836
- That's all?
- Yeah.

15:13.960 --> 15:14.915
Good.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.553
I wanted to take more,
but I decided not to.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.318
Very good.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.795
So should we put
the straitjacket on me now...

15:22.920 --> 15:25.150
or should we wait until my time's up?

15:25.280 --> 15:27.510
I'm not worried about you, Max.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.392
- No?
- Not at all.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.592
What you're telling me,
it's a good thing.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.709
Yeah?

15:34.440 --> 15:38.672
These representations of Kayla,
hallucinations or not...

15:38.800 --> 15:42.554
are a sign that you're starting
to get your life back in order...

15:42.680 --> 15:48.118
that maybe you're starting to let go of
your misplaced guilt about her death...

15:48.240 --> 15:51.949
that you're ready to stop blaming yourself
for what happened.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.559
What intrigues me...

15:54.680 --> 15:57.877
is that now that you've stopped wallowing
in the drugs and the alcohol...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.036
now that you're sober...

16:00.160 --> 16:03.948
your mind is ready to begin
processing the tragedy in earnest.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.551
You wanna come see me again
next week...

16:09.680 --> 16:12.433
get back to a regular
appointment type thing?

16:13.680 --> 16:15.511
Sure.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.189
Yeah.
I'll run the numbers tomorrow.

16:47.320 --> 16:49.788
<i>Okay. And then I placed the orders
for size 8 through 12.</i>

16:49.920 --> 16:52.115
<i>- No. No!
- Why? But-</i>

16:52.240 --> 16:56.153
It's like I told you earlier. I don't
want to order any of the larger sizes.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.633
<i>But I don't-
Why, Jenna?</i>

16:57.760 --> 16:58.715
Why?

16:58.840 --> 17:02.071
Because this Mayflower has to convey
the message that it's a boutique.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.667
And boutique
implies skin and bones.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.916
Yeah, I'm really sure.
Right, right. Okay.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.837
So, if we do the research...

17:09.960 --> 17:12.520
and it shows that the demographic
is full of heifers...

17:12.640 --> 17:14.392
then we'll order accordingly.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.955
But listen to me- Until then, four is
the new eight. Do you understand me?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.877
<i>- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you. Talk to you later.</i>

19:20.360 --> 19:23.238
Camera in the bathroom?

19:30.680 --> 19:32.796
Henry, you dirty dog.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.676
Just want to check in
on my new favorite employee.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.519
I'm good. Just happy to be here,
Mr. Landreaux.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.392
We're happy to have you, Max.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.718
Your dad entrusted me with the opening
of the new Mayflower as my top priority.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.954
You seem committed,
being here so late.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.516
Yeah. I can't let anything
interfere with our grand opening.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.074
Yeah. I should do my rounds.

20:00.840 --> 20:03.513
Hey, Max,
will you do me a favor?

20:03.640 --> 20:06.996
Call me Keller.
We're all family here at the Mayflower.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.351
Okay.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.749
Jenna?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.197
What are you-

22:33.120 --> 22:34.075
No!

22:59.640 --> 23:00.993
Fuck.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.191
Mornin', rookie.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.311
So, how did that last night go?

24:33.080 --> 24:35.275
Everything all right?

24:55.480 --> 24:57.038
<i>Dr. Beaumont's office.</i>

24:57.160 --> 25:00.675
This is Max Matheson. I need to see
Dr. Beaumont as soon as possible.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.552
<i>Okay, let me see what I have.</i>

25:10.320 --> 25:12.470
How do you think this happened?

25:12.600 --> 25:14.511
I don't know.

25:15.800 --> 25:19.270
Looks more like a-
just a terrible accident...

25:19.400 --> 25:21.391
but maybe someone killed her.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.112
Homicide by handmade guillotine?

25:25.240 --> 25:27.595
That would impress even yours truly.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.836
Yeah, me too, Pete.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.313
Me too.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.156
- Dr. Beaumont?
- Yes?

25:47.320 --> 25:51.393
Do you really believe all that, your
explanation for what's happening to me?

25:51.520 --> 25:55.229
Well, of course.
There's really no other explanation.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.158
And the fact that it's
all related to the mirrors...

25:58.280 --> 26:00.316
that that's how
I'm seeing these visions?

26:01.200 --> 26:02.553
<i>Méconnaissance.</i>

26:02.680 --> 26:04.033
What's that?

26:04.160 --> 26:08.915
It's a French term from Jacques Lacan's
mirror stage of psychoanalytic theory.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.395
The ego is a product
of false reflections.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.270
<i>Méconnaissance-</i>

26:13.440 --> 26:17.718
when the subject is alienated
from his or her self.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.513
In English?

26:21.640 --> 26:24.108
Nobody sees anything in a mirror...

26:24.240 --> 26:26.800
that isn't simply a part of them...

26:26.920 --> 26:29.514
not even things
they think they're seeing.

26:29.640 --> 26:33.315
Every culture has its own particular
myth set regarding mirrors.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.351
In Korea, for example...

26:35.480 --> 26:39.871
it's believed that a person's soul
can be trapped inside of a mirror...

26:40.000 --> 26:41.831
as it leaves the body.

26:41.960 --> 26:46.238
You've heard the old adage, a cracked
mirror brings seven years bad luck.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.113
And even here
in the South's recent past...

26:49.240 --> 26:52.789
it was not uncommon to cover
all of the mirrors in a house...

26:52.920 --> 26:55.639
where the wake of a deceased person
was being held.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.558
There's even a clinical diagnosis...

26:58.680 --> 27:02.593
for an intense fear of mirrors
called spectrophobia.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.676
Lots of psychic baggage
in them there mirrors.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.268
So I guess
I'm doing pretty well, then?

27:09.400 --> 27:10.753
In light of all you've been through...

27:10.880 --> 27:13.758
combined with all the superstitions
we hold regarding mirrors...

27:13.880 --> 27:17.350
I'd say you're doing
pretty good indeed.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.518
How are ya holdin' up?

28:14.520 --> 28:16.078
Fine.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.037
Your father didn't tell you.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.594
Tell me what?

28:21.720 --> 28:24.792
Jenna McCarty,
the woman you met the other day...

28:24.920 --> 28:27.150
she died last night.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.316
They found her in her apartment.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.272
How did she die?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.675
The police said she fell through glass.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.189
It ripped her head off.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.231
It was a horrible accident.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.671
Such a tragedy.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.031
Are you all right?

28:48.960 --> 28:53.192
Yeah. I'm... just surprised.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.118
You sure?

28:56.240 --> 28:57.593
Yeah.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.999
- Will you call me if you need anything?
- Yeah.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.790
Thanks.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.876
I still can't believe it.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.949
Hello?

29:45.280 --> 29:47.236
Are you here? It's me.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.639
Hello?

30:08.600 --> 30:10.477
Oh, God.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.353
I'm really starting to lose it again.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.355
<i>"P." "P." Parker.</i>

34:36.840 --> 34:38.114
Where's the number?

34:52.000 --> 34:52.955
God!

35:06.520 --> 35:08.272
Oh, God!

35:26.080 --> 35:27.911
<i>Hi. You've reached Ryan's
answering machine.</i>

35:28.040 --> 35:30.076
<i>I'm unable to get up
and get the phone right now...</i>

35:30.200 --> 35:32.760
<i>so leave me a message with your name
and your phone number...</i>

35:32.880 --> 35:35.189
<i>- Come on, goddamn it.
- and I will get back to you shortly.</i>

35:35.320 --> 35:36.719
<i>Take care.</i>

36:56.160 --> 36:58.549
You ever seen a 10-56 like that?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.318
I'm not sure.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.435
One thing I know-

37:02.560 --> 37:05.279
This is the second death of an employee
who worked at the Mayflower.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.472
The third, if you count the girl
who went missing two months ago.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.197
- Officer.
- Yes, sir.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.788
The witnesses.
Where'd you put 'em?

37:29.280 --> 37:30.508
Hey, Pic.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.991
Check out the badge.

37:41.040 --> 37:44.032
He's definitely a person of interest.

37:59.640 --> 38:00.755
Hello?

38:00.880 --> 38:02.791
Yeah, hi, Dad.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.876
What time is it?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.036
<i>I don't know. It's late.</i>

38:11.720 --> 38:13.278
What's going on, Max?

38:13.400 --> 38:16.790
I'm just- I'm calling
to let you know that I'm-

38:16.920 --> 38:19.718
I'm gonna be quitting my job.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.959
Are you all right?

38:22.080 --> 38:24.150
<i>No, not really.</i>

38:26.000 --> 38:28.230
I can't keep working there.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.791
It's too much.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.998
Too much?

38:34.120 --> 38:37.237
<i>Yeah.
I think I'm seeing things again.</i>

38:37.360 --> 38:39.191
I'm really sorry.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.117
<i>I don't care about the job.
Just-</i>

38:41.240 --> 38:44.596
<i>- I need to know that you're okay.
- Yeah.</i>

38:47.000 --> 38:48.399
I'm okay.

38:52.120 --> 38:57.353
Stop by tomorrow and drop off
your ID badge and all that, you know.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.436
Yeah, I will.
Thank you for understanding, Dad.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.199
<i>Max, I'm your father...</i>

39:04.320 --> 39:06.038
and I do support you.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.354
You know that.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.118
Yeah, I do.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.719
<i>Okay.</i>

39:10.840 --> 39:12.478
<i>Get some rest.</i>

39:12.600 --> 39:13.669
Okay.

40:40.360 --> 40:42.555
What's wrong with you?

41:29.080 --> 41:30.308
Dad!

41:37.840 --> 41:39.592
Dad!

41:41.400 --> 41:43.356
Max, what are you doing here?

41:44.080 --> 41:46.469
I know what I need to do.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.634
I came by-

41:51.040 --> 41:53.952
- I changed my mind.
- Good for you.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.230
I wanna stay at the Mayflower.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.920
Come here.
Give me one.

42:00.280 --> 42:02.077
Thank you.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.872
It's gonna be okay.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.312
Yeah, I know.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.990
We don't know why things happen
the way that they do...

42:10.120 --> 42:13.430
but they have a tendency
to work themselves out.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.755
Everything happens for a reason, Max.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.598
Yeah. Right.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.711
Are you hungry?

42:27.040 --> 42:28.758
Want a slice?

42:28.880 --> 42:30.791
I'm good.

42:37.880 --> 42:41.429
- Can you hold up a sec?
- Just need a minute.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.191
May I help you?

42:46.360 --> 42:48.476
Detective Huston, Homicide.

42:48.600 --> 42:51.114
Detective Piccirilli.
What he said.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.473
Homicide?

42:53.600 --> 42:55.556
We just come by to ask you
a few questions...

42:55.680 --> 42:57.636
about some fellow employees
at the Mayflower...

42:57.760 --> 43:00.991
see if you might know anything about 'em
that might be of interest to us.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.633
We went by your house.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.193
You weren't there.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.836
Okay. And?

43:07.960 --> 43:10.713
And why don't you tell us.

43:11.840 --> 43:12.989
Tell you what?

43:13.120 --> 43:16.556
You heard about one
Miss Jenna McCarty, correct?

43:18.320 --> 43:19.275
Yes.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.311
And you were also at the home...

43:22.040 --> 43:25.874
of Mr. Ryan Parker earlier tonight,
weren't you?

43:27.320 --> 43:29.436
Yeah. But-

43:29.560 --> 43:32.154
Then certainly you must have
gathered that he was dead, right?

43:32.280 --> 43:33.395
Right.

43:33.520 --> 43:36.193
Brutally murdered, as a matter of fact.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.038
Hence, homicide.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.831
Plural, actually, Pic.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.713
Homicides, with an S.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.398
You're right, man.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.715
There've been two homicides...

43:47.840 --> 43:50.149
involving employees
of the Mayflower this week.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.236
Since you were
at the scene of the crime tonight-

43:52.360 --> 43:53.759
And in charge of security-

43:53.880 --> 43:57.998
it stands to reason that you might have
an opinion or two about these matters.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.593
Am I a suspect?

44:09.520 --> 44:10.919
No.

44:11.040 --> 44:13.190
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

44:13.320 --> 44:14.548
Not officially.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.431
What, not officially?

44:17.560 --> 44:19.994
At this point the only thing
you're suspected of...

44:20.120 --> 44:22.270
is being a lousy security guard.

44:25.280 --> 44:30.593
So, why were you out front
of the deceased's home earlier tonight?

44:30.720 --> 44:34.030
Kind of a creepy coincidence,
don't you think?

44:35.720 --> 44:36.914
No.

44:37.840 --> 44:41.037
I don't think
it was a creepy coincidence.

44:41.160 --> 44:42.752
Not at all.

44:42.880 --> 44:46.475
And I might be a lousy security guard,
but it seems to me that the two of you are...

44:46.600 --> 44:50.673
not too much better
at the detective stuff.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.950
If you'd have done your homework,
you would've seen that...

44:53.080 --> 44:55.389
Mr. Parker is
the vice president of operations...

44:55.520 --> 44:58.592
here at this particular branch
of the Mayflower Department Store.

44:58.720 --> 45:02.269
And per protocol,
if anything goes wrong, it is my duty...

45:02.400 --> 45:05.119
to contact Mr. Parker immediately.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.071
Why not just call him?

45:07.200 --> 45:10.078
As soon as you stop badgering me
and you get back to your work...

45:10.200 --> 45:13.397
you'll be happy to see that the phone
records indicate that I did, in fact...

45:13.520 --> 45:15.795
try to call Mr. Parker.

45:15.920 --> 45:20.277
Probably, I might add, during the time at
which Mr. Parker was being, as you say...

45:20.400 --> 45:22.311
brutally murdered.

45:24.120 --> 45:27.829
Might be kind of hard for me
to have been the one killing him too.

45:27.960 --> 45:32.238
So you ran over
to the deceased's home...

45:32.360 --> 45:35.557
to let him know you were
having a problem with-

45:35.680 --> 45:37.636
With the mirrors.

45:43.600 --> 45:47.513
So unless there are any other questions,
I'd really like to get back to my work.

45:47.640 --> 45:50.074
- No more questions.
- For now.

45:50.200 --> 45:53.237
- We just wanted to stop by.
- Say hi.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.158
And let you know that
we got our eye out on you.

45:59.240 --> 46:02.357
I feel so much safer knowing that.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.550
Thank you very much, Detectives.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.117
I don't understand.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.039
Who are you?

46:36.160 --> 46:38.151
What do you want?

48:00.520 --> 48:02.397
She worked here.

49:48.840 --> 49:52.515
<i>- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Elizabeth Reigns?</i>

50:02.200 --> 50:03.633
Hi. Elizabeth.

50:04.440 --> 50:06.556
Hi. I'm Max.

50:06.680 --> 50:07.999
Hi.

50:11.640 --> 50:15.030
You wanna talk about my sister?
You said you might have some information.

50:15.160 --> 50:16.718
Yeah.

50:18.200 --> 50:22.557
I think maybe I've seen her recently.

50:23.560 --> 50:24.913
Where?

50:26.000 --> 50:28.150
At the Mayflower.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.396
Where at the Mayflower?

50:32.840 --> 50:34.717
In the mirrors.

50:36.880 --> 50:40.077
What- In the mirrors?
What do you mean, in the mirrors?

50:40.200 --> 50:42.316
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy...

50:42.440 --> 50:46.069
but I see her reflection
in the mirrors.

50:46.200 --> 50:50.796
And l-
Then I turn around and she's gone.

50:50.920 --> 50:53.070
She's not there anymore.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.076
I don't know
who put you up to this.

50:56.200 --> 50:59.670
My sister, my little sister Eleanor has
been missing for almost two months now.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.950
And you just turn this
into some kind of joke.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.150
No, it's not a joke.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.113
Listen to me.

51:09.240 --> 51:11.196
- Listen, I'm serious.
- Don't touch me!

51:12.880 --> 51:15.110
Just don't touch me.

51:15.240 --> 51:18.038
I know what I said, it sounds crazy.

51:19.880 --> 51:21.757
It's the truth.

51:23.640 --> 51:27.553
So this started happening the first night
that you were working there?

51:29.320 --> 51:30.833
How can that be?

51:30.960 --> 51:32.916
How is it that out of everyone
that works there...

51:33.040 --> 51:35.554
you're the only one
that can see my sister?

51:36.760 --> 51:40.719
A year ago,
I was driving with my fiancée.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.315
What?

52:03.160 --> 52:04.513
Nothin'.

52:07.400 --> 52:08.753
Okay.

52:13.400 --> 52:16.392
Can you reach into the backpack,
grab my phone for me?

52:16.520 --> 52:19.159
- Yeah.
- I need to call my dad.

52:19.280 --> 52:21.874
Okay, hang on. Drive safe.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.673
- Okay, Max?
- Yeah. I got it.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.552
- Please. Thank you.
- I can see.

52:26.680 --> 52:28.272
Perfectly?

52:28.400 --> 52:31.358
- Come on, I'm a great driver.
- Yeah.

52:31.480 --> 52:32.435
Okay.

52:34.200 --> 52:35.997
Where did you say it was?

52:36.880 --> 52:38.029
In the front there.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.635
Front. Front.

52:42.840 --> 52:45.638
- Are you sure?
- Honey, it's right there.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.396
Any luck?

52:58.720 --> 53:00.073
Oh, my God.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.117
Max Matheson,
is this what I think it is?

53:04.240 --> 53:07.198
- Well, what do you think it is?
- I don't know.

53:36.920 --> 53:38.911
A drunk driver.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.792
He hit you?

53:40.920 --> 53:42.876
I swerved to avoid him.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.958
I wrapped my car
around a telephone pole.

53:46.080 --> 53:48.435
Technically, it was my fault.

53:50.240 --> 53:52.071
And your fiancée, she-

53:52.920 --> 53:55.275
she died in the accident?

53:57.120 --> 53:58.997
We both did.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.793
Start an IV.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.118
Stay still, sir.

56:04.760 --> 56:06.751
They brought you back.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.829
Maybe I brought back
something with me...

56:11.960 --> 56:16.112
some ability to see
the other side or something.

56:20.320 --> 56:23.596
Afterward, I just got pretty
screwed up for a while-

56:23.720 --> 56:25.278
drugs, alcohol...

56:25.400 --> 56:27.356
whatever I could put into me.

56:28.680 --> 56:31.114
Like I was trying to get
closer to her or something.

56:32.200 --> 56:34.714
- Wasn't your fault.
- I was the one driving.

56:34.840 --> 56:38.116
You were trying to swerve to get out
of the way. You were trying to save her.

56:39.440 --> 56:42.000
Yeah, but I couldn't.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.110
I couldn't save her.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.754
You wanted to see her again.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.990
Yeah. More than you could ever know.

56:58.760 --> 57:00.876
How long's your sister been missing?

57:02.240 --> 57:04.674
About two months.

57:05.800 --> 57:07.836
And you still think she's-

57:09.760 --> 57:11.193
Dead?

57:16.120 --> 57:20.511
Of course, the cops say that young women
up and leave all the time to start new lives.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.271
But Eleanor and I...

57:25.400 --> 57:29.871
we weren't just sisters, we were
best friends, we were soul mates.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.911
And the night that she...

57:32.040 --> 57:34.474
disappeared...

57:34.600 --> 57:39.116
I woke up from a deep sleep,
screaming for no reason.

57:40.240 --> 57:44.028
My heart was beating so fast,
I thought it was gonna explode.

57:45.600 --> 57:47.556
I knew right then and there.

57:49.520 --> 57:52.956
What was your sister doing
the day she disappeared?

57:53.600 --> 57:55.830
Working at the Mayflower.

57:55.960 --> 58:00.988
There was some sort of party that night
and she was- she'd just been hired on.

58:01.120 --> 58:04.078
They were having
a groundbreaking celebration.

58:14.680 --> 58:17.592
I gotta get to work.

58:17.720 --> 58:21.315
Yeah, I gotta get some sleep.
I gotta work again tonight.

58:21.440 --> 58:24.079
Call me if anything else comes up.

58:25.120 --> 58:26.838
Absolutely.

58:26.960 --> 58:29.030
Thank you, Max.

58:31.240 --> 58:34.630
I haven't done anything.
Not yet, anyway.

58:34.760 --> 58:37.115
But you're trying.

58:37.240 --> 58:40.118
That's more than anyone else
has been willing to do around here.

59:22.200 --> 59:24.191
Eleanor.

59:26.920 --> 59:29.070
I'm trying my best.

59:29.200 --> 59:31.475
I'm trying my best. Really.

59:37.440 --> 59:41.035
Please. Stop doing this.

59:46.560 --> 59:48.710
Wait. What are you doing?

59:50.480 --> 59:53.916
Please, don't- don't do this.

59:54.040 --> 59:56.156
Please.

59:56.280 --> 59:57.633
No.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.276
Tell me what I need to do.
Please, tell me. Just-

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.550
What is it? What?

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.479
<i>Hello.</i>

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.556
What night did she disappear?

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.432
<i>It was a Wednesday night.</i>

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.630
What was the specific date?

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.988
How come?

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.430
<i>Well, it's a long shot,
but I thought maybe...</i>

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.677
<i>if something happened to Eleanor while
she was working here at the Mayflower...</i>

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.995
maybe the security cameras
caught something.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.153
It was Wednesday, September 22.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.190
The 22nd.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.311
It's not here.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.395
<i>What?</i>

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.999
It's missing.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.872
<i>- Missing?
- Yeah.</i>

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.230
Somebody erased it.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.432
<i>- Who?
- Well, give me a minute.</i>

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.549
Yeah, last viewed September 24.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.477
Two days after she disappeared.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.668
<i>Who was the last person
to view those files?</i>

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.756
Yeah, last viewed,
Henry David Schow.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.108
Who's that?

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.358
He's the security guard I replaced.
The guy cut himself up and then quit.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.431
<i>They say he's gone totally crazy.</i>

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.596
All after my sister went missing.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.754
Can you pick me up?

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.476
Henry Schow?

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.477
Henry, you in there?

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.191
- Henry, is that you?
- Stay away from me.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.959
Come on.
Henry, open the door.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.837
I said stay away.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.033
Henry, we're not here to hurt you.
We just wanna ask a couple questions.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.995
Don't shut- Henry!

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.393
Who are you?

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.433
I'm your replacement at the Mayflower.
I'm the new night security guard.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.674
You've seen her then?

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.913
Seen who?

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.359
Her.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.836
Eleanor.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.349
What do you know about Eleanor?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.956
Nothin'. I don't know nothin'.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.275
Henry, you don't have to lie to us.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.359
- I'm not lying!
- Yes, you are! What are you hiding?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.274
She wants to kill me.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.558
Why does my sister want to kill you?

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.238
Your sister?

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.996
Henry, did you kill my sister?

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.515
No. I don't know
what happened to her.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.149
But why do you think
she wants to kill you?

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.032
I don't know.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.912
What about the files?

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.709
What files?

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.796
The digitized security camera files.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.956
The one from the night
she went missing.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.957
The ones you erased, Henry.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.151
I was just following orders!

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.397
Henry, who told you
to erase those files?

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.988
Mr. Landreaux, Keller Landreaux...

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.429
asked me to get rid of 'em,
said it was important.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.313
- Keller.
- That's when your sister first showed up.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.317
That night.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.238
That's when she started
haunting all my mirrors.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.715
Henry, there's something
you're not telling us.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.990
I told you everything.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.236
Henry, now, my sister
went missing the next day.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.193
And somebody asked you to erase
those security files from the cameras...

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.880
and you didn't think that
was a little bit suspicious?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.594
No, I didn't.
I didn't think that. L-

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.909
I just didn't wanna know.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.828
Henry, you need to tell us everything
that happened that night. Everything.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.275
I just want her to leave me alone.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.517
She's not gonna stop this
until she gets what she wants.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.438
Until she gets the truth, Henry!

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.755
I don't know the truth.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.317
Keller threatened my job, so I just-
I went along with him.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.877
We were in the basement.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.468
He said we had to erase the files.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.913
I'm sorry!

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.917
The basement.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.197
We have to go back to the Mayflower.
We have to check the basement.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.789
Basement.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.272
I'm sorry!

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.436
What is it?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.437
There's rust on the ground.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.672
I think it came from that.
It's been moved.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.631
Give me a hand?

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.751
It's a crawl space.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:19.839
You okay in there?

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.198
- Max?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:40.635
Don't say a word
or you're both dead.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.397
I'm gonna be right back.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.354
Max, we need to talk.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.233
Just come out.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.917
- Max, he's got a gun!
- Shit!

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.154
Fuck!

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.872
Really need to loosen that one up.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.148
Look out, world.
Jenna McCarty's up to her old tricks.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.477
Now, now. The only way to keep
the new hires under your thumb...

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.194
is to make sure
you have dirt on them.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.108
And nothing commands more respect
than knowing that you...

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:12.234
have made a complete and total asshole
of yourself in front of the higher-ups.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.792
You're bad.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.596
- So where you from originally?
- So anyway-

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.598
- There's the guy right there.
- Here you go, miss.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.870
You know that girl right there?
She's in accounting?

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.435
I've seen her before, but I haven't
really met that many people yet, so-

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.959
And what about you?

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:35.119
I'm in operations, so,
pretty much the day-to-day stuff.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.196
I think she's got something for you.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.276
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. You're drinking water?

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.277
- Yes. I've been so thirsty.
- Driving.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.235
Elizabeth!

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.911
Help!

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.953
Look, I didn't wanna hurt your sister!
I don't wanna hurt you!

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.956
Why are you making me do this?
Why won't you listen to me!

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.752
Get off me!

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.951
What the fuck?

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.558
What the fuck?

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.391
Honey, are you okay?

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.317
- I just-
- What happened?

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.112
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, boss.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.878
She's, you know, been drinking.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.754
Oh, no. Looks like somebody
had a little too much to drink.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.997
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Keller's gonna take you home, sweetie.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.829
Yeah, that won't be a problem.
Here, come here, baby. Here.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.837
- Just get her arm.
- There we go.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.394
- You'll be fine.
- There we go.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.080
You'll be fine.
Just drink a lot of water.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.071
Have fun.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.989
Want a shot?

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.872
- Yes, please.
- Two.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.552
- I left my purse at work.
- Okay, we'll go back. No problem.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.238
My keys.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.718
Wait.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.111
- Where are we going?
- There you go.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.432
I'm gonna get you home
safe and sound.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.437
I have to go home?

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.117
And here we are.
Let's get your keys and get you home.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.919
I just feel so-

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.755
- No, no, no.
- Get off me!

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.594
Get off me!
Get off me!

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.789
Stop it!

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.076
We need to talk about this!
Eleanor, we need to talk about this!

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.076
Eleanor! Where are you going?
Come here!

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.236
I just wanna talk to you!

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.751
I just wanna talk to you!

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.514
What?

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.113
Help! Max!

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.433
Stop!

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.634
Don't move, bitch.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.591
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up!

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.118
I can't let this happen.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.156
Walk!

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.316
I just wanna talk to you!

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.110
I swear to Christ,
I'm not gonna hurt you!

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.868
I just wanna talk.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.833
I just think you're
a little confused, that's all.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.311
Get down there, Eleanor!

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.637
- Eleanor?
- I just want to talk.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.716
You're gonna ruin everything!

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.471
Get off of me!

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.716
This is your fault, Eleanor!

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.194
All you had to do was talk to me!

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.591
Fuck.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.715
I'm so stupid!

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.034
I'm so stupid!

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.999
Help! Get off me!

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.156
Get off me!

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.997
Get back, Elizabeth!

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.950
Drop it, Keller.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.438
It's over, Keller.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.351
Oh, my God!

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.597
It's over.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.749
We did it, Max.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.831
So let me get this straight.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.077
So even after you helped
Keller Landreaux...

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.112
cover up the crawl space hole
with a furnace...

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.596
and erase all the digital files
from the security cameras...

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.474
you didn't think something was,
I don't know...

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.352
fishy?

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.516
No, sir, I didn't.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.397
But you'd heard the girl went missing.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.276
Yes, sir, I did.

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:31.436
And you're willing to sign a confession
admitting everything you've told us?

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.595
Yeah.

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.278
Which you understand...

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.356
will be admitting to your role...

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.916
in the conspiracy to cover up
the murder of Eleanor Reigns.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.428
What say we get this man a pen.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.837
You took the words
right out of my mouth, Pic.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.030
Okay, what gives, Pete?

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.069
That was the easiest
interrogation ever.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.758
I don't know, Pic.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.316
First time I ever played
good cop, good cop though.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.397
Must be some catch.
