<i>My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.524 --> 00:05.325
<i>and I graduated from one
of Canada's top business schools</i>

00:05.327 --> 00:07.360
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.362 --> 00:09.362
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:09.364 --> 00:11.231
<i>to help struggling
small-business owners</i>

00:11.233 --> 00:13.000
<i>make it
in this competitive world.</i>

This is <i>Nathan for you.</i>

00:25.280 --> 00:28.247
<i>Nabil Khalil is the owner
of Bouquet Plaza Liquor</i>

00:28.249 --> 00:30.249
<i>in Santa Clarita,
California,</i>

00:30.251 --> 00:32.652
<i>and every day,
he deals with a problem</i>

00:32.654 --> 00:34.754
<i>that has vexed
liquor store owners for years.</i>

00:34.756 --> 00:36.689
We always have teenager

00:36.691 --> 00:38.290
trying to come
and buy alcohol.

00:38.292 --> 00:39.658
We always refuse the sale.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.126
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>

00:41.128 --> 00:44.162
<i>no business should ever have to
turn away a paying customer,</i>

00:44.164 --> 00:46.732
<i>so I paid Nabil a visit
to help him out.</i>

00:46.734 --> 00:48.400
Every time you turn away
a teenager

00:48.402 --> 00:51.136
who's trying to buy alcohol,
you're losing a sale.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.671
Yes, because that's
what the law is.

00:52.673 --> 00:56.475
Mm-hmm. So, from now on,
you allow them to purchase it,

00:56.477 --> 01:00.077
but they just can't take it home
until they're 21.

01:05.083 --> 01:07.318
<i>The main reason
teenagers want booze</i>

01:07.320 --> 01:09.354
<i>is to look cool
to their friends,</i>

01:09.356 --> 01:11.756
<i>so if Nabil let minors
purchase alcohol,</i>

01:11.758 --> 01:13.424
<i>but then held it
in a storage locker</i>

01:13.426 --> 01:16.728
<i>until their 21st birthday,
Bouquet Plaza Liquor would gain</i>

01:16.730 --> 01:19.564
<i>a ton of new underage customers,
who could then</i>

01:19.566 --> 01:22.333
<i>brag to their friends
that they own booze.</i>

01:22.335 --> 01:26.603
<i>The plan, increase business
by selling alcohol to minors.</i>

01:26.605 --> 01:29.406
Could be possible, but
when you get close to that age,

01:29.408 --> 01:31.475
definitely, you don't want
a voucher that says,

01:31.477 --> 01:33.377
"Oh, yes, I own
couple bottle of liquor,"

01:33.379 --> 01:35.679
But where they are?
So they want to have it.

01:35.681 --> 01:37.981
Well, no offense,
but, you know, I'm a bit closer

01:37.983 --> 01:40.183
to my teenage years
than you are,

01:40.185 --> 01:45.054
so I think I know
what youth these days want.

01:45.056 --> 01:47.390
If they get the happiness
of "Yes, I have it,"

01:47.392 --> 01:48.591
that would be great.

01:48.593 --> 01:50.926
<i>With Nabil on board,
I created some tags</i>

01:50.928 --> 01:53.328
<i>that would work like
a coat check system for alcohol.</i>

01:53.330 --> 01:56.031
<i>So minors could reclaim
their booze from storage</i>

01:56.033 --> 01:57.566
<i>once they turn 21.</i>

01:57.568 --> 02:00.569
<i>Next, I had to get
the word out to young people,</i>

02:00.571 --> 02:01.771
<i>so I arranged a meeting</i>

02:01.773 --> 02:03.672
<i>with the chair
of a local youth little league</i>

02:03.674 --> 02:06.275
<i>in the hopes of landing
a sponsorship deal.</i>

02:06.277 --> 02:09.210
You seriously are talking
about putting a banner

02:09.211 --> 02:10.878
that says,
"We sell liquor to minors"?

02:10.881 --> 02:13.415
These minors don't
actually get to take home

02:13.417 --> 02:15.316
the alcohol
till they're 21.

02:15.318 --> 02:18.920
Well, I do understand it,
but I'm not sure that I agree

02:18.922 --> 02:21.956
with tying that
up to our little league.

02:21.958 --> 02:23.591
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

02:23.593 --> 02:25.326
I don't know
if this helps in any way,

02:25.328 --> 02:28.930
but we'd also be willing
to offer a free bottle of gin

02:28.932 --> 02:31.265
to every kid in the league.

02:31.267 --> 02:33.700
No, I'm sorry.

02:33.702 --> 02:35.803
Thank you
for your time, then.

02:35.805 --> 02:36.904
Well, thank you
for your offer.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.040
- Yeah.
- I'm sure it'll work out.

02:39.042 --> 02:41.642
- Oh, no.
- What?

02:41.644 --> 02:44.445
- What is this for?
- This--

02:44.447 --> 02:45.712
- What is this for?

02:45.714 --> 02:47.248
Oh, no, no, no.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.682
No, no.
Thank you very much, though.

02:48.684 --> 02:49.984
- Are you--
- Let me show you out.

02:49.986 --> 02:52.085
- No, no, are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. We're done.

02:52.087 --> 02:53.754
<i>With sponsorship
off the table,</i>

02:53.756 --> 02:56.056
<i>I needed a different way
to reach the youth market,</i>

02:56.058 --> 02:58.859
<i>so I hired a teen actor
to pose as a student</i>

02:58.861 --> 03:01.394
<i>to get the word spreading
at a local high school.</i>

03:01.396 --> 03:03.196
So right off the bat,
you know, before you talk

03:03.198 --> 03:04.397
about the liquor store
or anything,

03:04.399 --> 03:06.299
you got to establish
a rapport

03:06.301 --> 03:08.836
so the teens you're talking to
think you're cool.

03:08.838 --> 03:10.736
- Okay.
- So maybe talk about

03:10.738 --> 03:12.939
how school sucks, you know,
or a bit

03:12.941 --> 03:14.740
about how the Internet's
awesome or something.

03:14.742 --> 03:16.443
and throw in
some swear words too.

03:16.445 --> 03:18.478
So try that.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.779
Hey, man, what's up?

03:19.781 --> 03:22.682
Hey, dude, that Internet
these days is so dope.

03:22.684 --> 03:23.883
Man, school sucks, dude.

03:23.885 --> 03:25.685
You can just go
on the stinking Internet.

03:25.687 --> 03:27.954
<i>With Connor trained,
I gave him a backwards hat</i>

03:27.956 --> 03:30.456
<i>and sunglasses
so he would look cooler.</i>

03:30.458 --> 03:31.857
<i>Then I sent him
onto school property</i>

03:31.859 --> 03:33.758
<i>to begin spreading the word.</i>

03:33.760 --> 03:36.195
So how about that internet,
man? What's up?

03:36.197 --> 03:39.331
Oh, the teacher sucks, but
the Internet rules, you know?

03:39.333 --> 03:41.133
So, anyways,
I got this cool tip.

03:41.135 --> 03:42.734
There's this liquor store
down the block.

03:42.736 --> 03:46.571
It's called
Bouquet Plaza liquor store,

03:46.573 --> 03:49.673
and it sells alcohol
to minors.

03:49.675 --> 03:53.077
Okay, I got to go
back to skipping class.

03:53.079 --> 03:55.279
<i>With Connor working
the school,</i>

03:55.281 --> 03:57.015
<i>I headed
back to Bouquet Plaza,</i>

03:57.017 --> 03:59.317
<i>ready to receive
our underage customers,</i>

03:59.319 --> 04:02.853
<i>and within minutes,
they began to arrive.</i>

04:02.855 --> 04:04.522
Did you read
the sign outside?

04:04.524 --> 04:05.856
- That's-- Did you--
- That's real?

04:05.858 --> 04:07.124
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. You can

04:07.126 --> 04:08.325
- Go grab some if you want.
- You want to go ahead

04:08.327 --> 04:09.359
and grab yourself
some alcohol or something?

04:10.662 --> 04:12.629
I mean, I guess so.

04:12.631 --> 04:14.697
- Look what you got, huh?
- Look at that.

04:14.699 --> 04:17.233
- 40 ounce.
- Oh, that's huge, buddy.

04:17.236 --> 04:18.567
- High life, awesome.
- You're gonna start heavy,

04:18.570 --> 04:19.569
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

04:21.339 --> 04:23.040
- So you own this now.
- Yeah, it's tight.

04:23.042 --> 04:25.608
Pretty sweet.
Ah, ah, not so close.

04:25.610 --> 04:28.177
You get a claim check,
so you're allowed to come back

04:28.179 --> 04:30.546
and claim it when you're 21.

04:30.548 --> 04:31.914
Yeah, but--

04:31.916 --> 04:34.450
I want it for right now.
I don't want it two years later.

04:34.452 --> 04:37.219
<i>With no refunds allowed,
the minors had no other option</i>

04:37.221 --> 04:40.756
<i>but to fill out the claim check,
allowing them to own alcohol</i>

04:40.758 --> 04:42.824
<i>without the consequences
of consuming it.</i>

04:42.826 --> 04:45.560
What you're doing is weak.
That sucks.

04:45.562 --> 04:46.994
It's cool and legal.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.563
Breaking the law
is never cool.

04:48.565 --> 04:51.032
Seems like a waste
of money to me.

04:51.034 --> 04:53.168
<i>My plan was working,
and Nabil was now able</i>

04:53.170 --> 04:55.836
<i>to sell to a whole new type
of customer.</i>

04:55.838 --> 04:58.239
Why did I even
just pay for this?

04:58.241 --> 04:59.874
Because you're allowed
to own the alcohol.

04:59.876 --> 05:01.809
Okay, well, I don't want
to own the alcohol.

05:01.811 --> 05:03.344
I want the alcohol.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.379
<i>Knowing that some teens
wouldn't be satisfied</i>

05:05.381 --> 05:08.115
<i>leaving empty-handed,
I had a corner of Nabil's store</i>

05:08.117 --> 05:10.384
<i>converted to look
like a cool basement</i>

05:10.386 --> 05:12.553
<i>so minors could take photos
with their alcohol,</i>

05:12.555 --> 05:14.054
<i>before it goes into storage,</i>

05:14.056 --> 05:17.257
<i>that would help them
brag to their friends.</i>

05:17.259 --> 05:20.127
<i>It felt great
to make young people happy</i>

05:20.129 --> 05:23.663
<i>while teaching them
about responsible drinking.</i>

05:23.665 --> 05:25.565
<i>So after closing up
for the night,</i>

05:25.567 --> 05:27.767
<i>it broke my heart
that I had to give Nabil</i>

05:27.769 --> 05:29.435
<i>some terrible news.</i>

05:29.437 --> 05:31.471
I looked into it,
and it turns out

05:31.473 --> 05:35.408
that what we were doing
was extremely illegal,

05:35.410 --> 05:38.277
and you know,
I got to look out for myself.

05:38.279 --> 05:39.646
I'm sorry.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.515
Good evening, sir.

05:42.517 --> 05:43.549
- Yes?
- Are you the owner

05:43.551 --> 05:45.051
- of this business?
- Yes, sir. Hi.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.220
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
place you under arrest.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.988
Why? What's going on, sir?
How am I--

05:48.990 --> 05:50.590
For doing good business!

05:55.363 --> 05:57.630
You're not in trouble at all,
I was joking.

05:57.632 --> 05:59.732
So really?
It does work out?

05:59.734 --> 06:00.933
Yeah, it's not illegal.

06:00.935 --> 06:02.335
- Okay.
- I mean, he's not a real cop,

06:02.337 --> 06:03.902
- he's a stripper, yeah.
- That's okay.

06:03.904 --> 06:05.870
But to bring
a stripper to a businessman,

06:05.872 --> 06:07.539
it's not a really
good idea, no.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.673
- Oh, you don't like it?

06:08.675 --> 06:09.907
Not at all. Like, okay--

06:09.909 --> 06:11.009
Well, it was a joke,
you know,

06:11.011 --> 06:12.644
like, you thought he was a cop.
You know?

06:12.646 --> 06:14.078
That's what I'm saying,
even if it's gonna be a joke,

06:14.080 --> 06:17.215
Nathan, to bring a businessman,
bring him, like, stripper--

06:17.217 --> 06:20.718
a guy stripper, it's not really
gonna be the cool thing to have.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.987
All right.

06:28.477 --> 06:30.639
<i>Javier Arteaga
is an exterminator</i>

06:30.641 --> 06:32.241
<i>and the manager
of Bugs "A" to "Z,"</i>

06:32.243 --> 06:33.641
<i>a pest-control company</i>

06:33.643 --> 06:35.944
<i>based out of Woodland Hills,
California,</i>

06:35.946 --> 06:37.978
<i>and he's desperate
to expand his business</i>

06:37.980 --> 06:41.048
<i>beyond the residential
homes he normally services.</i>

06:41.050 --> 06:45.019
It'd be great if, I mean,
we land any kind of hotel work.

06:45.021 --> 06:47.988
<i>Javier wanted a contract
with a major hotel,</i>

06:47.990 --> 06:50.391
<i>and I had the perfect method
to win him that deal.</i>

06:50.393 --> 06:53.561
Rather than making it
look like the hotel has

06:53.563 --> 06:56.364
an exterminator visiting,
why don't you instead

06:56.366 --> 06:59.500
make it look like the hotel
is winning an award?

07:01.403 --> 07:02.903
Right.

07:02.905 --> 07:06.239
<i>Every hotel's greatest fear is
having to hire an exterminator,</i>

07:06.241 --> 07:08.575
<i>because their arrival
is basically an announcement</i>

07:08.577 --> 07:10.644
<i>that the hotel has pests,</i>

07:10.646 --> 07:12.779
<i>so if Javier could disguise
his purpose</i>

07:12.781 --> 07:15.682
<i>to make it look like he's there
to give the hotel an award,</i>

07:15.684 --> 07:17.317
<i>he'd not only delight guests,</i>

07:17.319 --> 07:19.619
<i>but surely win a contract
with the hotel</i>

07:19.621 --> 07:22.556
<i>that wants to keep
their pest problem a secret.</i>

07:22.558 --> 07:26.025
Now, how--I mean,
do I show up with--

07:26.027 --> 07:30.730
I mean, I just--
I-I--as far as, I mean--

07:30.732 --> 07:32.798
If customers see you
coming in,

07:32.800 --> 07:34.333
they're actually
gonna be like,

07:34.335 --> 07:36.769
"Oh, this hotel
is really good,"

07:36.771 --> 07:38.337
you know, rather than seeing
an exterminator

07:38.339 --> 07:41.273
and being like,
"Oh, this hotel is not so good."

07:41.275 --> 07:43.776
You've done this before.

07:43.778 --> 07:45.411
You know,
you're a business major.

07:45.413 --> 07:49.248
I mean, what's the worst
that's gonna happen?

07:49.250 --> 07:50.883
<i>Javier was on board
with the concept.</i>

07:50.885 --> 07:53.318
<i>So, to sell this to a hotel,
I needed to show them</i>

07:53.320 --> 07:55.754
<i>exactly how the system
would work,</i>

07:55.756 --> 07:58.022
<i>so I had one of Javier's
service vans rewrapped</i>

07:58.024 --> 08:01.826
<i>to look like a delivery vehicle
for the Hotel Excellence Awards,</i>

08:01.828 --> 08:05.162
<i>a very prestigious organization
that I made up.</i>

08:05.164 --> 08:07.866
<i>Then Javier and I worked
to develop a discreet method</i>

08:07.868 --> 08:10.468
<i>for exterminating
every room in a hotel.</i>

08:10.470 --> 08:12.970
- Like, some sort of secret...
- A compartment

08:12.972 --> 08:14.938
- or or an opening.
- Compartment that opens up.

08:14.940 --> 08:17.040
<i>With the system now in place,
I got permission</i>

08:17.042 --> 08:20.577
<i>from the historic Mayfair Hotel
to shoot a demonstration video</i>

08:20.579 --> 08:24.448
<i>of our method that we could then
present to their management.</i>

08:24.450 --> 08:26.850
<i>It begins by arriving
in our covert vehicle,</i>

08:26.852 --> 08:29.319
<i>then removing what looks
like a large trophy</i>

08:29.321 --> 08:31.555
<i>that's being awarded
to the hotel.</i>

08:31.557 --> 08:33.457
<i>This serves a dual purpose
of both getting</i>

08:33.458 --> 08:36.159
<i>our equipment inside,
and impressing guests,</i>

08:36.160 --> 08:38.561
<i>as they see that they're
currently residing in the hotel</i>

08:38.563 --> 08:40.964
<i>with the least amount
of bedbugs.</i>

08:40.966 --> 08:43.499
- With the least bedbugs?
- Yeah.

08:43.501 --> 08:45.735
So it's a possibility
of some being there.

08:45.737 --> 08:46.903
We're just delivering
the award,

08:46.905 --> 08:48.438
- we don't know.
- Oh, okay.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.341
<i>Then, we make our way
into the private back offices</i>

08:51.343 --> 08:53.209
<i>where we can safely remove
all our gear</i>

08:53.211 --> 08:55.878
<i>without anyone seeing.</i>

08:55.880 --> 08:59.014
<i>Once that's done,
we convert our awards table</i>

08:59.016 --> 09:01.016
<i>into a custom-designed
maid cart,</i>

09:01.018 --> 09:05.555
<i>and I change my outfit
to look natural pushing it.</i>

09:05.557 --> 09:08.290
<i>The hollowed-out interior
then allows Javier to travel</i>

09:08.292 --> 09:10.593
<i>from room to room
without drawing any suspicion</i>

09:10.595 --> 09:11.761
<i>from hotel guests.</i>

09:12.996 --> 09:15.364
You okay in there?

09:15.366 --> 09:17.266
Yeah.

09:17.268 --> 09:18.900
<i>When we get
to an infested room,</i>

09:18.902 --> 09:21.636
<i>the cart blocks the doorway
and Javier is able</i>

09:21.638 --> 09:23.972
<i>to sneak out
without anyone seeing.</i>

09:23.974 --> 09:27.442
<i>A quick handoff of the vacuum
then gets our equipment inside,</i>

09:27.444 --> 09:28.810
<i>and Javier can get to work</i>

09:28.812 --> 09:31.145
<i>spraying down
the pest-ridden areas.</i>

09:31.147 --> 09:33.682
<i>Although we didn't
find any in this hotel,</i>

09:33.684 --> 09:35.984
<i>Javier told me he often
encounters mattresses</i>

09:35.986 --> 09:37.853
<i>that get so infested
with bedbugs</i>

09:37.855 --> 09:39.287
<i>they have to be thrown out.</i>

09:39.289 --> 09:41.388
<i>So I also wanted to show
the hotel manager</i>

09:41.390 --> 09:43.624
<i>that we had a method
to secretly dispose of one</i>

09:43.626 --> 09:46.794
<i>without guests thinking
anything fishy was going on,</i>

09:46.796 --> 09:49.864
<i>and since the Mayfair catered
to a lot of Asian clientele,</i>

09:49.866 --> 09:52.800
<i>the perfect cover
was obvious.</i>

09:54.000 --> 10:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here

10:14.222 --> 10:16.423
<i>In the guise
of an impromptu celebration,</i>

10:16.425 --> 10:18.091
<i>we were able to take
a mattress</i>

10:18.093 --> 10:20.760
<i>straight through the lobby,
and once outside,</i>

10:20.762 --> 10:23.963
<i>all it took was a quick
identity changeover</i>

10:23.965 --> 10:27.567
<i>to keep everything
looking normal to onlookers.</i>

10:27.569 --> 10:29.602
<i>Then, in the blink of an eye,
we're gone,</i>

10:29.604 --> 10:31.303
<i>without anyone ever knowing</i>

10:31.305 --> 10:34.240
<i>the hotel had a problem
with pests.</i>

10:34.242 --> 10:36.876
<i>So later that week,
I was hopeful our sales video</i>

10:36.878 --> 10:39.478
<i>would be enough to win over
the Mayfair manager,</i>

10:39.480 --> 10:41.547
<i>Mike Schoeffin.</i>

10:41.549 --> 10:44.550
Underneath that dragon
is our mattress

10:44.552 --> 10:47.653
that was covered with bedbugs,
infested with bedbugs.

10:47.655 --> 10:50.722
And you can see we've been
developing a new method

10:50.724 --> 10:55.227
of spraying the public areas
using a blind man's cane.

10:55.229 --> 10:57.496
So to guests,
it just looks like,

10:57.498 --> 11:00.831
"Oh, there's a blind man
stumbling around the lobby."

11:00.833 --> 11:03.601
- Right.
- So that's what we're about.

11:03.603 --> 11:05.603
<i>And once our sales video
was done,</i>

11:05.605 --> 11:06.904
<i>it was time to seal the deal.</i>

11:06.906 --> 11:09.340
Let's get your signature
on that contract.

11:09.342 --> 11:11.742
I'm not gonna make
a decision right this minute.

11:11.744 --> 11:14.812
Mike didn't seem to want to do
business with Bugs "A" to "Z,"

11:14.814 --> 11:18.349
so I excused Javier
to speak with Mike one-on-one.

11:18.351 --> 11:21.885
Hey, so it's clear
you don't want to give

11:21.887 --> 11:24.088
a deal to us today,
right?

11:24.090 --> 11:26.990
Not without comparing
all the numbers, no.

11:26.992 --> 11:29.926
You know, I have a TV show,
and on the show,

11:29.928 --> 11:31.562
we like to have happy endings,

11:31.564 --> 11:34.998
so would you be able to sign
this contract

11:35.000 --> 11:39.035
just for the cameras?

11:39.037 --> 11:40.870
Uh, if it's just
for the cameras,

11:40.872 --> 11:43.272
as long as it's not binding.

11:43.274 --> 11:46.509
Great, here you go,
just sign here and--

11:46.511 --> 11:49.612
just for the cameras.

11:49.614 --> 11:51.680
- There you go.
- All right,

11:51.682 --> 11:54.517
so we have a deal then.

11:54.519 --> 11:56.986
We have a deal
in the TV show--

11:56.988 --> 12:01.123
Oh, no, but in the contract,
it said that

12:01.125 --> 12:03.558
"I understand
that when Nathan asks,

12:03.560 --> 12:06.294
"'Will you sign this contract
for the camera?'

12:06.296 --> 12:08.963
"I understand that that's code
for 'Will you sign the contract

12:08.965 --> 12:10.999
"'in real life.'"
- Oh.

12:11.001 --> 12:13.101
- You can see.
- Mm-hmm.

12:13.103 --> 12:14.836
- That clause right there.
- Right.

12:14.838 --> 12:18.206
The contract was presented
to me under false pretenses.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.541
Trust me,
this is a good call,

12:19.543 --> 12:21.042
so you shouldn't feel bad
about this.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.111
- No, you tricked me, and it's--
- It's not a trick.

12:23.113 --> 12:24.278
- No, it is a trick.
- No, it's not a trick.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.312
And I don't appreciate it.

12:25.314 --> 12:27.281
Everything
was in the contract.

12:27.283 --> 12:28.783
I don't appreciate it.

12:28.785 --> 12:31.019
<i>I did it,
and I couldn't wait to share</i>

12:31.021 --> 12:32.419
<i>the good news with Javier.</i>

12:32.421 --> 12:35.857
Yeah. All right.
Happy, right?

12:35.859 --> 12:38.592
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

12:40.514 --> 12:44.350
<i>Rub-a-dub-dub,
splish, splash,</i>

12:44.352 --> 12:49.355
<i>suck, suck, and...</i>

12:49.357 --> 12:51.158
<i>These are just
some of the sounds you'd hear</i>

12:51.160 --> 12:53.560
<i>if you paid a visit
to Los Feliz car wash</i>

12:53.562 --> 12:55.829
<i>in Atwater Village,
California.</i>

12:55.831 --> 12:59.799
<i>But one sound you won't hear
that often is "Cha-ching."</i>

12:59.801 --> 13:02.034
<i>Amir Lankarani
is the owner here,</i>

13:02.036 --> 13:04.837
<i>and he admits that lately,
business has been tough.</i>

13:04.839 --> 13:08.474
Occasionally,
can be very much so struggle.

13:08.476 --> 13:10.810
But for a man
whose business is cleaning,

13:10.812 --> 13:13.112
<i>I was surprised
by how filthy his office was,</i>

13:13.114 --> 13:15.014
and it made me wonder
if this was part

13:15.016 --> 13:16.982
<i>of a sophisticated strategy.</i>

13:16.984 --> 13:19.919
Do you keep your office
this dirty to make a point

13:19.921 --> 13:23.756
to your customers that you
only care about cleaning cars?

13:23.758 --> 13:26.759
Yes, rather than trying
to clean my office,

13:26.761 --> 13:29.729
I put my emphasis
in cleaning their car.

13:29.731 --> 13:31.097
So this is all
intentional.

13:31.099 --> 13:32.664
Yes.

13:32.666 --> 13:34.867
I mean, I've seen clutter,
but you go all out.

13:34.869 --> 13:37.302
- Well, I do my best.
- Yeah, I mean,

13:37.304 --> 13:40.405
you have a full-size
toilet bowl under your desk.

13:40.407 --> 13:45.945
Well, the reason behind it is,
we bought it for our--

13:45.947 --> 13:47.446
What is it?
One of the bathrooms,

13:47.448 --> 13:50.314
haven't had the chance
to replace it yet.

13:50.316 --> 13:51.916
You don't use that toilet?

13:51.918 --> 13:52.951
Not here, no.

13:52.953 --> 13:54.018
- No?
- No.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.653
<i>Amir clearly had
a unique approach</i>

13:55.655 --> 13:57.888
<i>for marketing his car wash,
and that meant</i>

13:57.890 --> 14:00.625
<i>I had an idea
that he was gonna love.</i>

14:00.627 --> 14:03.026
<i>Los Feliz car wash
is uniquely situated</i>

14:03.028 --> 14:05.329
<i>in a neighborhood
with very few birds,</i>

14:05.331 --> 14:07.831
<i>so if Amir could somehow
attract more birds</i>

14:07.833 --> 14:10.934
<i>to specific trees that overhang
the streets nearby,</i>

14:10.936 --> 14:13.738
<i>demand for his services
would surely go up.</i>

14:13.740 --> 14:17.508
<i>The plan, more birds
equals more business.</i>

14:17.510 --> 14:19.143
Birds?

14:19.145 --> 14:21.178
I mean, there's nothing
wrong with putting a bird

14:21.180 --> 14:23.413
- in a tree.
- That's true.

14:23.415 --> 14:26.683
What they do after that
is their own choice.

14:26.685 --> 14:27.917
That's right.

14:27.919 --> 14:30.353
So, if they do that on a car,
it benefits you,

14:30.355 --> 14:32.389
- But--
- More dirty cars,

14:32.391 --> 14:36.926
more dollar signs coming inside
the register.

14:36.928 --> 14:38.227
You're right.

14:38.229 --> 14:40.697
<i>Amir was into the idea,
so the first step</i>

14:40.699 --> 14:43.266
<i>was finding the right tree
to host the birds.</i>

14:43.268 --> 14:45.134
<i>Directly across the street
from the car wash</i>

14:45.136 --> 14:47.603
<i>was the perfect branch
that hung over traffic.</i>

14:47.605 --> 14:49.838
<i>This is where
I needed them to be.</i>

14:49.840 --> 14:52.040
<i>Since I know birds
love bird seed,</i>

14:52.042 --> 14:53.375
<i>I sprinkled some
along the branch</i>

14:53.377 --> 14:56.011
<i>and all over the tree
in the hopes of attracting them,</i>

14:56.013 --> 14:59.815
<i>but surprisingly, after a day,
no birds had come.</i>

14:59.817 --> 15:01.717
<i>So I emptied out
a couple of tuna cans</i>

15:01.719 --> 15:03.786
<i>and packed them
with earth worms and soil</i>

15:03.788 --> 15:05.620
<i>then taped those
to the branches,</i>

15:05.622 --> 15:07.655
<i>thinking that this would be
a more appealing treat.</i>

15:07.657 --> 15:10.692
<i>I even put tiny scarecrows
in other trees in the area</i>

15:10.694 --> 15:12.860
<i>that I didn't want
the birds to go in,</i>

15:12.862 --> 15:15.162
<i>but again,
no birds showed up,</i>

15:15.164 --> 15:17.131
<i>and I wasn't about to spend
the rest of my life</i>

15:17.133 --> 15:18.733
<i>helping this car wash.</i>

15:18.735 --> 15:20.935
<i>So I arranged
for a bird wrangler to come</i>

15:20.937 --> 15:23.838
<i>and physically put pigeons
up on the branch,</i>

15:23.840 --> 15:25.472
<i>but frustratingly,
they weren't pooing enough</i>

15:25.474 --> 15:27.474
<i>to make the impact I needed,</i>

15:27.476 --> 15:28.675
<i>so I talked
to the bird wrangler</i>

15:28.677 --> 15:30.977
<i>to see if she had
any other ideas.</i>

15:30.979 --> 15:34.881
Chickens or peacocks, they--
they poop pretty good.

15:36.218 --> 15:37.484
Don't you think chickens
would maybe look

15:37.486 --> 15:39.553
a bit strange
in the tree though?

15:39.555 --> 15:42.021
- Maybe?
- No, chickens roost in trees.

15:42.023 --> 15:44.757
So it wouldn't really
stand out as being that weird?

15:44.759 --> 15:46.826
- No, uh-uhh.
- Okay.

15:46.828 --> 15:48.627
- I trust your instincts, then.
- Yeah.

15:48.629 --> 15:51.430
<i>Taking Carol's advice,
we added some chickens</i>

15:51.432 --> 15:54.066
<i>to the tree, which she said
had to go more regularly,</i>

15:54.068 --> 15:56.702
<i>and it helped,
but the dropping size</i>

15:56.704 --> 15:58.471
<i>just wasn't big enough
to persuade people</i>

15:58.473 --> 16:00.339
<i>into getting their cars
washed,</i>

16:00.341 --> 16:02.307
<i>so we arranged to have
a peacock added to the mix</i>

16:02.309 --> 16:06.644
<i>that can drop loads
50% larger than the chickens.</i>

16:06.646 --> 16:08.947
<i>And with that, I felt like
I had everything I needed</i>

16:08.949 --> 16:10.916
<i>to get things started.</i>

16:10.918 --> 16:12.484
<i>So I posted a sign
at the car wash</i>

16:12.486 --> 16:14.253
<i>advertising a new special.</i>

16:14.255 --> 16:17.256
<i>Now I wanted to show Amir
the birds in the tree.</i>

16:17.258 --> 16:20.225
Wow.

16:20.227 --> 16:21.760
- That's great.
- Yeah.

16:21.762 --> 16:24.528
I mean, it just looks--
Mother Nature, doesn't it?

16:24.530 --> 16:27.265
So people are driving under,
they're dropping all over cars,

16:27.267 --> 16:28.966
and then
where are they gonna go?

16:28.968 --> 16:30.734
Right there
across the street.

16:30.736 --> 16:34.671
- Yeah.
- Makes--you know, makes...

16:34.673 --> 16:37.041
common sense, doesn't it?

16:37.043 --> 16:39.410
<i>Now I needed to figure out
a way to get cars to stop</i>

16:39.412 --> 16:42.045
<i>so the birds would have enough
time to do their business.</i>

16:42.047 --> 16:45.181
Sir, sorry. Sorry, I dropped
my contact lens over here,

16:45.183 --> 16:46.149
so I'm just looking for it.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.386
Yeah, I don't-- I'm worried
you might drive over it.

16:50.575 --> 16:52.118
Could you help me?

16:56.063 --> 16:57.164
Yeah.

16:57.209 --> 17:00.110
Um, I don't know where.

17:03.198 --> 17:06.000
Oh.
There's a lot of birds today.

17:06.046 --> 17:07.945
Sorry, there's a car wash
down the street,

17:07.941 --> 17:10.074
they can do a really good job
of taking it off.

17:10.076 --> 17:11.214
If you want,
there's a coupon.

17:11.778 --> 17:13.377
<i>My plan was finally
paying off.</i>

17:13.380 --> 17:14.878
You got chickens
up in that tree.

17:14.881 --> 17:17.248
<i>The droppings were actually
encouraging drivers</i>

17:17.250 --> 17:19.415
<i>to pay a visit
to the car wash.</i>

17:19.417 --> 17:20.784
<i>As the day progressed...</i>

17:20.786 --> 17:23.720
Do you know how to get
to the Hollywood sign from here?

17:23.722 --> 17:26.056
<i>Nature was taking its course,
and even though</i>

17:26.058 --> 17:28.758
<i>I took a brutal splash
in the mouth...</i>

17:38.435 --> 17:40.803
<i>I'd do it again in an instant
if it meant bringing in</i>

17:40.805 --> 17:43.705
<i>one more customer
to that car wash.</i>

17:43.707 --> 17:45.107
<i>So at the end of the day,
I met up with Amir</i>

17:45.109 --> 17:47.676
<i>to see if he was happy
with my results.</i>

17:47.678 --> 17:49.545
So how do you feel
about everything today?

17:49.547 --> 17:53.115
Beautiful. Seems like the idea
is working a little bit,

17:53.117 --> 17:55.851
at least I saw a few cars
with the bird poo-poo.

17:55.853 --> 17:57.786
Poop, yeah.
Now, just so you know,

17:57.788 --> 18:00.655
I bought all of the pigeons
and the chickens for you,

18:00.657 --> 18:03.458
so you can go and put them up
yourself if you choose.

18:05.661 --> 18:07.128
Okay.

18:07.130 --> 18:08.964
Now, I know this might be

18:08.966 --> 18:11.466
a bit of an awkward subject
to broach,

18:11.468 --> 18:14.702
but I know you have an "employee
of the month" program here.

18:14.704 --> 18:16.537
- Yes, we do.
- You know,

18:16.539 --> 18:20.107
I obviously showed you today
that I did a good job,

18:20.109 --> 18:22.643
and so I was wondering

18:22.645 --> 18:27.515
if you would consider me
for that.

18:27.517 --> 18:29.984
For the employee
of the month?

18:29.986 --> 18:31.919
Yeah.

18:34.523 --> 18:35.590
Sure.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.024
Okay, thanks.

18:37.026 --> 18:38.893
You're quite welcome.

18:38.895 --> 18:41.795
Now, do you normally
do a ceremony or something?

18:41.797 --> 18:45.632
We normally just present them
with a $25 gift certificate.

18:45.634 --> 18:50.437
Okay, it maybe is a bit low
for what I did.

18:50.439 --> 18:54.774
Is it possible
to up it to $200?

18:54.776 --> 18:56.176
Sure.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.145
Great,
thank you so much, that's...

18:58.147 --> 18:59.646
- My pleasure.
- such an honor, I mean--

18:59.648 --> 19:02.342
Okay.
You're quite welcome.

19:02.577 --> 19:06.423
"Welcome to our

19:06.514 --> 19:08.581

19:33.873 --> 19:35.839

- Yes, you, Nathan.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.405
- Oh, my God, really?
- Yes.

19:38.464 --> 19:40.577
Oh, my God.
I'm so surprised.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.880
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.348
- Thank you very much.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.283
Uh...

19:47.953 --> 19:50.320
Oh, thank you.

19:50.322 --> 19:55.558
- "And there's
your $200 cash prize..."

19:55.560 --> 19:59.562
- Bonus.
- Your $200 cash bonus.

19:59.564 --> 20:02.098
Thank you so much.
Oh, my God.

20:04.736 --> 20:07.669
Oh, okay.

20:12.943 --> 20:14.576
Thank you.

20:14.578 --> 20:17.012
"Now, if you can all
form a line,

20:17.014 --> 20:20.049
"Then Nathan will walk
past you,

20:20.051 --> 20:23.485
"and you can pat him
on the back."

20:23.487 --> 20:25.754
Okay,
it's a bit embarrassing,

20:25.756 --> 20:28.456
- Right.
- Okay.

20:30.926 --> 20:34.929
Thank you. Thank you.

20:34.931 --> 20:37.698
Oh, wow.
