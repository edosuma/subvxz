24:47.453 --> 24:49.520
-Whoo!
-Love it.

25:05.605 --> 25:06.971
Walt?

25:08.174 --> 25:09.607
Hi, Dad.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.277
Does your mother know?

25:14.247 --> 25:16.480
I barely knew myself.

25:18.684 --> 25:19.950
So...

25:21.888 --> 25:23.454
This is the new place.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.156
Mmm.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.526
Homey.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.960
Hmm.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.163
Still playing.

25:33.165 --> 25:37.101
-Never good enough to play.
-Yeah, you are. You just...

25:37.103 --> 25:39.203
You never wanted
anybody to know.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.805
-How come?
-I thought you were
in country.

25:43.543 --> 25:44.775
I was.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.443
I am.

25:47.013 --> 25:51.949
-How'd you get leave
to come back?
-New policy.

25:53.553 --> 25:56.253
It's a little different
from my day.

25:57.490 --> 25:58.989
Lots of things are.

Spent four years in Soledad.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.284
First shot at you,
every racist DA in the county

26:27.286 --> 26:29.853
would buy me dinner
and throw in Rams tickets.

26:29.855 --> 26:33.724
I'll pray for your soul,
sue your ass into the dirt,

26:33.726 --> 26:36.760
and wait for the day
I can beat it bloody.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.269
I don't know why
you got to make it personal.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.137
You know? Leo.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.273
All right, so...
So you want me

26:49.275 --> 26:50.140
to identify the guy?

26:50.142 --> 26:53.344
-'Cause I told you
that I was at the studio...
-Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo.

26:53.346 --> 26:54.878
You know why you're here.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.281
On some level, you got to be
a little relieved, right?

26:57.283 --> 27:00.284
All right, all right.
You know what? I knew it.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.686
Here's the thing
about murder, Leo.

27:02.688 --> 27:06.624
You deny it, get arrested,
get charged, found guilty,

27:06.626 --> 27:09.460
make us spend all that time
and money, you fry.

27:09.462 --> 27:10.527
When you and I both know that

27:10.529 --> 27:14.098
you'll barely make it
past the charge part.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.499
Doctors gave you what?

27:15.501 --> 27:17.935
Six months? Six months?

27:17.937 --> 27:21.171
No DA wants to walk you
into a courtroom.

27:23.776 --> 27:24.642
I called my lawyer.

27:24.644 --> 27:27.711
-And he's gonna be here.
He's gonna be here anytime.
-Okay.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.747
He was my wife's lawyer
back in the day, yeah.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.148
Oh, wow. I know him?

27:31.150 --> 27:33.083
(LAUGHS) Robert Rollins.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.618
-Oh, he's a big gun, yeah.
-That's right.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.389
And he loved Joycie, so I'm
not saying anything. Nothing.

27:38.391 --> 27:39.823
Charmain? Can I talk to you
for a minute?

27:39.825 --> 27:40.758
I'm saying nothing, nothing.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.027
That's good, Leo.
You did a good thing.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.062
-A very, very good thing.
-Mmm-hmm.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.964
You just sit tight
right there,

27:46.966 --> 27:51.435
and, uh, I'm gonna walk
and talk to your neighbor
Mrs. Lee

27:51.437 --> 27:54.571
and get a sworn statement
from her that you were home.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.940
Then I'm gonna talk
to that young man over there,

27:56.942 --> 27:59.910
who says he heard your wife
scream shortly
before 8:00 a.m.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.945
-Oh.
-Yeah, he was right
outside your door

28:01.947 --> 28:03.614
passing out those leaflets.

28:03.616 --> 28:04.715
No, no, no.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.950
-You arrested him, all right?
-Bye-bye, alibi, Leo.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.118
He's not helping you.
He's not helping you.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.020
No, he's not the
most willing witness ever.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.388
I had to do
a little convincing.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.856
-(DOOR OPENS)
-Charmain.

28:12.858 --> 28:16.527
The lawyer for

28:16.529 --> 28:17.761
-Robert Rollins.
-Rollins, Rollins.

28:17.763 --> 28:22.099
Yeah, I want you to make sure
that he gets here right away.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.701
Thank you.

28:24.670 --> 28:25.869
Okay, Leo.

28:25.871 --> 28:31.508
What I finally got
is an actual case,
which I do not want.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.446
But I also don't want another
open homicide on my desk.

28:35.581 --> 28:38.348
I will give you
my word of honor that you

28:38.350 --> 28:40.584
will never see the inside
of a jail or a court.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.753
-Can I talk to you?
-No.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.288
-Outside.
-No.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.222
Outside, just a second.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.691
Leo, you know
how much you hate
the coloreds?

28:47.693 --> 28:51.295
-I need to talk to you.
-Well, not half as much
as they hate you.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.197
And they can burn you today.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.698
Hodiak, I need to talk to you.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.100
But you confess,
and you get to go home.

28:56.102 --> 28:59.369
No, I need to talk to you
right now, outside.

28:59.371 --> 29:00.738
Thank you.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.506

-Open...
-Charmain.

-Come on.

29:16.188 --> 29:16.687
Hey.

29:16.689 --> 29:18.188
-You know what's up, right?
-Huh?

29:18.190 --> 29:19.189
When the guy's lawyer
gets here,

29:19.191 --> 29:20.791
you tell him there's
some confusion,

29:20.793 --> 29:22.459
that his client is not
in observation,

29:22.461 --> 29:23.761
he's at the other side
of the building.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.829
-In booking, you say.
-Hey! (CLAPPING)

29:25.831 --> 29:27.331
Come on, let's go.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.866
-Okay.
-You know what? Yeah, I...

29:28.868 --> 29:30.400
-You got it?
-I'd be happy to, yes.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.703
My lawyer's gonna be
here in just a moment, second.

29:32.705 --> 29:34.738
As soon as he does,
you're gonna spend the rest

29:34.740 --> 29:38.041
of what's left of your life
in jail.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.110
You want that?

29:41.147 --> 29:42.446
I don't.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.449
Excuse me,
I'm looking for my client,

29:45.451 --> 29:46.250
Leo Nankins.

29:46.252 --> 29:49.353
Do I look like I work here?

29:54.593 --> 29:57.127
It's a birthday card.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.595
Open it.

Margot Fonteyn's coming
to town in a month.

right?

30:11.477 --> 30:12.409
(SOBBING) Yeah.

30:12.411 --> 30:16.680
Yeah, she knew this was
an important birthday.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.152
That's the thing
about wives, Leo.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.387
They're never
the worst thing they say

30:23.389 --> 30:27.024
or the best thing they do,
and neither are we.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.296
Okay, all right.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.301
Okay, come on, Leo.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.736
Now it's time
to write it all down.

30:40.105 --> 30:43.340
You owe it to her.

-Yes.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.414
Thank you.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.849
You're under arrest.

31:25.851 --> 31:27.150
Hands behind your back.

31:27.152 --> 31:28.218
What? What?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.286
-Ow.
-Yeah.

31:29.288 --> 31:30.354
Thing is, Leo,

31:30.356 --> 31:31.855
cops can lie,
but we can't make deals.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.958
-No, you promised.
-And wives can be
a lot of things,

31:34.960 --> 31:37.294
but we don't get to
beat them to death.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.061
Come on.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.763
-I'm gonna tell.
-Where is that thing?

31:39.765 --> 31:40.530
All right? I'm gonna tell.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.000
I'm gonna tell my lawyers
what you did.

31:43.002 --> 31:43.867
Yeah, you do that.

31:43.869 --> 31:44.835
You take it all the way
to the Supreme Court.

31:44.837 --> 31:49.539
Speaking of which,
you have the right
to remain silent.

31:51.844 --> 31:53.110

31:54.346 --> 31:57.247
-Oh. Indian giver.
-Yeah.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.283
(SIGHS)

31:59.618 --> 32:04.187
Anything you say can
be used against you in court.

32:04.189 --> 32:07.958
You have the right
to talk to a lawyer.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.095
Bunchy, your deep
understandable hatred

32:12.097 --> 32:16.800
of the Nankins
has helped put Mister
sadly where he belongs.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.402
So... Thank you?

32:18.404 --> 32:20.137
No. Thank you.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.840
You're either asking me
to join the Nation of Islam

32:23.842 --> 32:24.875
or telling me to dress better.

32:24.877 --> 32:27.344
One of the Nation's
objectives is for all Negroes

32:27.346 --> 32:29.413
to leave the
United slave States

32:29.415 --> 32:31.615
and repopulate
our native Africa.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.216
But when you imprison me
without reason...

32:33.218 --> 32:34.985
-Without reason?
-...to achieve your objective

32:34.987 --> 32:36.820
despite the suffering
you inflicted on me...

32:36.822 --> 32:38.355
You were interfering
with a police investigation.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.423
I see now that
my true path lies

32:39.425 --> 32:40.958
not in flight from
this country...

32:40.960 --> 32:43.126
Oh, Bunchy, I've known you
since you were 11 years old.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.728
My true path lies
in changing this country

32:44.730 --> 32:46.163
because I'm not a pacifist.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.864
No, you're a crook
in a new costume.

32:47.866 --> 32:50.033
You are a living lie.

32:50.703 --> 32:55.706
I am the truth who
will burn your world
to the ground.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.344
Does this mean
I really get to keep the tie?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.779
Watch your back, Hodiak.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.762
Jimmy C.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.065
Is it my turn in the box?

33:22.067 --> 33:24.334
Are you gonna, what,
sweat me for an apology?

33:24.336 --> 33:26.503
This is how it goes.
When I am closing a case,

33:26.505 --> 33:27.671
you never, ever do that again!

33:27.673 --> 33:29.339
Closing a case?
Is that what you call that?

33:29.341 --> 33:31.008
-The guy did it!
-The guy had rights!

33:31.010 --> 33:32.109
-Not today.
-Back up.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.877
-What?
-Back up.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.515
You think all you did
was lean on a perp?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.717
When you haul in
an innocent man...

33:40.719 --> 33:41.151
Bunchy?

33:41.153 --> 33:42.285
On some trumped-up
obstruction beef

33:42.287 --> 33:43.854
you know
he had nothing to do with...

33:43.856 --> 33:44.988
Child, he didn't know that.

33:44.990 --> 33:47.958
He's just a dumb spade
to you, right?

33:47.960 --> 33:50.127
-Oh...
-Yeah, doesn't know nothing
about nothing.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.496
-Grow up.
-Easiest target in the world.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.797
I was shaking him loose.

33:53.799 --> 33:54.364
You hold him overnight.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.366
You dump a crime spree on him
he had nothing to do with.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.435
Would you pull any of that
if he were white?

33:58.437 --> 34:00.971
Would I pound
the fear of God into some mope

34:00.973 --> 34:02.773
I needed to bend
if he was white?

34:02.775 --> 34:03.840
Yes.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.742
I did, for you.

34:05.744 --> 34:06.843
(CHUCKLES)

34:06.845 --> 34:09.312
If you think
those things are the same,

34:09.314 --> 34:12.382
maybe we can't do this,
you and me.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.683
And you helped me out,

34:13.685 --> 34:15.085
and I want to help you
find that girl,

34:15.087 --> 34:18.355
but I will not do the job
the way you do.

34:18.357 --> 34:21.024
You don't even know
what the job is.

34:24.129 --> 34:25.429
You know what?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.164
Give me a ride home.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.065
Excuse me?

34:28.067 --> 34:31.501
We get through this
or past it.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.137
You know, like,
literally half the time,

34:34.139 --> 34:37.307
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.517
Oh, hey, Howard.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.587
I'm good. You?

34:52.224 --> 34:53.457
Huh?

34:54.093 --> 34:55.392
Come on.

34:55.994 --> 34:57.360
She did?

34:57.663 --> 34:58.528
Seriously?

34:58.530 --> 35:01.431
Well, the ladies, huh?
What are you gonna do?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.471
Him I like.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.706
-KRISTIN: And the baby
does this...
-Hey.

35:09.708 --> 35:13.343
Hey, honey.
Have a nice chat with Howard?

35:13.512 --> 35:14.744
Always.

35:15.481 --> 35:16.746
Hi.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.049
You're home early.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.452
Mwah.

35:22.588 --> 35:23.987
Yeah, this is Hodiak.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.021
Uh, we work together.

35:25.023 --> 35:26.556
-Sam.
-Kristin.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.658
Nice to meet you.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.560
And then who is this?

35:30.729 --> 35:31.528
Bernadette.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.330
Bernadette? My favorite saint.

35:33.332 --> 35:36.800
Well, I'm not too sure
that's her career path.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.069
-Mmm-mmm.
-(LAUGHS)

35:39.938 --> 35:41.805
(BERNADETTE COOING)

35:44.009 --> 35:45.242
Yes.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.043
-Subtle.
-(DOOR CLOSES)

35:47.045 --> 35:48.845
Don't lead a subtle life.
Thought you ought to know.

35:48.847 --> 35:53.316
I don't unless we are going to
keep on looking for Emma.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.955
Then I guess you do.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.225
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

36:02.995 --> 36:04.928
CUTLER: <i> So, Sam,</i>
<i> this thing with Walt.</i>

36:04.930 --> 36:06.763
<i> I talked to my brother-in-law</i>
<i> at Pendleton.</i>

36:06.765 --> 36:09.366
The thing I don't get is
how he just got out.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.233
I mean,
my brother-in-law said,

36:10.235 --> 36:13.103
"The only way you ever
get sent stateside is

36:13.105 --> 36:13.970
"if one of your parents
is dying."

36:13.972 --> 36:17.607
And, I mean, it takes
letters and doctors and all...

(EXHALES)

36:26.351 --> 36:28.285
SAM: Opal.

36:28.687 --> 36:29.920
Officer.

36:36.762 --> 36:41.064
You sent the letter, didn't
you? To get him back.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.332
Said you were what?

36:42.334 --> 36:43.300
Sick? Dying?

36:43.302 --> 36:47.237
Which one of your barfly
friends did you get to
play the doctor?

36:47.940 --> 36:48.505
(GLASS SHATTERS)

36:48.507 --> 36:51.408
Our son is AWOL
from a combat zone.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.810
He's a deserter.
He could go to prison.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.045
You too.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.113
You're in a real
pickle there, Officer.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.648
You gonna turn me in?

36:58.650 --> 37:01.585
No. You're gonna do
what's right.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.553
You're gonna turn him in.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.988
I won't have to.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.556
They'll come for him.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.959
You have no idea
what you've done.

37:09.962 --> 37:11.194
Walt?

37:25.143 --> 37:27.911
So his secretary said

37:28.513 --> 37:31.514
Ken had gotten nine phone
calls from Manson.

37:31.516 --> 37:34.551
She said, as far as she knows,
Ken never returned.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.386
But he got the messages.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.520
SAM: Hmm.

37:37.522 --> 37:41.758
Well, here's the log,
just dates and times.

37:42.327 --> 37:45.662
I'm having so much trouble
understanding this,

37:45.664 --> 37:47.530
why Ken is...

37:47.633 --> 37:49.299
(LAUGHS)

37:49.768 --> 37:52.836
-This isn't...
-Sam Hodiak wears glasses.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.405
-I don't know
what you're talking about.
-No? Mmm.

37:55.407 --> 37:58.575
-Invisible.
-(CHUCKLES)

37:59.411 --> 38:00.710
Okay.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.046
What about Ken?

38:05.317 --> 38:11.054
I don't remember the last time
I understood him.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.024
<i> He's a sphinx.</i>

38:18.230 --> 38:23.667

<i> candidate he will vote for.</i>

38:32.678 --> 38:33.276
(CHUCKLES)

38:33.278 --> 38:37.981
But I've never had any idea
what he was thinking ever.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.550
Why did you marry him?

38:42.120 --> 38:43.486
Hot summer.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.424
You were long gone.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.898
My dad liked him.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.568
So, not strong reasons.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.372
I got pregnant.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.942
-That's a good reason.
-(LAUGHS)

39:05.944 --> 39:07.477
So what about you?

39:07.746 --> 39:10.814
Why did you marry, you know...

39:10.882 --> 39:12.115
-Opal?
-Yeah.

39:12.117 --> 39:12.982
-Opal.
-Why did you marry her?

39:12.984 --> 39:17.187
(LAUGHS) I can't remember.
I can't remember.

39:18.323 --> 39:22.225
I can't remember.

39:26.198 --> 39:29.399
Are you sure
I can't get you a drink?

39:32.137 --> 39:34.204
(SIGHS)

39:34.206 --> 39:35.905
Pretty sure.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.743
You don't drink anymore,
do you?

39:40.011 --> 39:45.315
Drinking, I don't tend
to make the best decisions.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.196

you get the other half.

and it's over for you.

Anything?

Shit, Ken...

We're not enemies.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.484
We never were.

I called and called and
called, wouldn't answer.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.097
It's all right.

Be free.

Do you remember
how free we were?
