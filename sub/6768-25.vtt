WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:06.756
{\an6}(grunts)
Okay, so I'm
a little nervous.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.925
{\an1}I don't see why.
Why?

00:09.008 --> 00:10.093
Kel, this guy's one of

00:10.176 --> 00:11.594
{\an3}the hottest journalists
in the country.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.431
{\an1}No, you are the hottest
journalist in the country.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.932
(chuckles):
I'm serious.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.392
Will you relax!

00:17.475 --> 00:20.270
Shoot! You know more about
this stadium than the guys

00:20.353 --> 00:21.771
who are building it.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.440
Proposing to build it.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.441
Right. Sorry.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.443
{\an3}You told me
a hundred times.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.236
I'm sorry-- Peter Raitt,
is coming out here

00:28.319 --> 00:29.237
specifically to talk to me.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.448
He's read my stories;
he thinks I'm an expert.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.616
{\an3}Well, you are-- and
after listening to you,

00:33.700 --> 00:35.910
{\an6}so am I.
I've been talking
about it that much?

00:35.994 --> 00:37.495
Only obsessively.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.456
Excuse me for taking
my job seriously.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.790
{\an3}And what's that supposed
to mean? I don't?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.500
{\an3}My job's not
as important as yours?

00:42.584 --> 00:43.501
Kel, not now, please.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.670
{\an1}I've got to go
look over my notes.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.422
{\an3}(sighs):
Don't let me stop you.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.471
Oh... (chuckles)

00:54.554 --> 00:57.140
Last night was one for
the record books. Mmm.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.933
{\an1}I don't want to hear
about it, Steve.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.393
Guess how many rounds.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.312
Four.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.313
{\an3}Four?
Four full rounds!

01:04.397 --> 01:07.150
{\an5}(chuckles):
In a 12-hour period,
I might add.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.485
You know, Steve,
she was supposed

01:08.568 --> 01:10.320
to stay for a night;
she's been here a week.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.362
I know.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.614
Can you blame her?

01:12.697 --> 01:14.073
Yeah.

01:15.074 --> 01:17.285
Morning, Brandon.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.703
{\an3}Steven.
Mm. Mm.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.996
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.165
You're not gonna eat that?

01:22.248 --> 01:23.500
{\an3}I'm not?

01:23.583 --> 01:26.377
No. I'm making you
a <i> real</i> breakfast.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.879
Ooh.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.881
Is she great or what?

01:29.964 --> 01:31.007
What.

01:31.090 --> 01:31.674
Jealous.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.384
{\an3}KELLY: Can I
get your keys?

01:33.468 --> 01:35.011
Your car's blocking mine.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.888
Oh, yeah, I'll move it.
I'll move it.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.348
I know how valuable
your time is.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.100
{\an1}You just have to do this
today, don't you?

01:41.184 --> 01:42.352
{\an1}Keys.
Fine, if you want

01:42.435 --> 01:43.520
to be pissed, be pissed.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.355
{\an1}I'm not having
this argument with you.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.315
God forbid-- you have
more important things to do.

01:47.398 --> 01:49.317
{\an1}Have a nice day.
Oh, you, too.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.486
{\an1}I hope your meeting
is glorious.

01:51.569 --> 01:54.364
How could it not be,
with support like that?

01:54.447 --> 01:56.366
You want support
that'll never let you down?

01:56.449 --> 01:57.492
Buy a jock.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.577
Copy that.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.996
(bell clanging,
seabirds chirping)

02:02.080 --> 02:03.540
{\an3}Have you seen
my black pumps?

02:03.623 --> 02:05.875
{\an1}Why don't you
try under here.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.544
(both laugh)

02:07.627 --> 02:09.169
Well, I would <i> love</i> to,

02:09.253 --> 02:11.756
{\an3}but I have a meeting
downtown in 20 minutes.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.636
Try this on.

02:17.637 --> 02:21.140
(giggling):
Ooh. Wow.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.563
Oh, my God, Noah.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.483
It's beautiful.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.026
Why don't you move in with me.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.529
What?

02:34.612 --> 02:36.573
I mean, it's crazy the way we go
back and forth all the time.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.409
{\an3}That's a really sweet offer,
seriously,

02:39.492 --> 02:41.452
but I can't do it.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.913
Okay, why?

02:45.957 --> 02:48.710
{\an3}Done it before,
the whole moving-in thing.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.712
Never works out.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.255
Yeah, with David, not with me.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.715
Yeah, but...

02:53.798 --> 02:56.551
{\an3}I kind of made
a promise to myself:

02:56.634 --> 03:00.179
Next time I move in
with someone, it'll be forever.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.433
Here you go.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.436
I didn't ask for it back.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.604
I just figured...

03:07.687 --> 03:09.606
Look, I understand if you don't
want to move in with me.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.358
{\an1}I don't agree with it,
but I understand.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.405
This bracelet, it's...

03:17.488 --> 03:19.407
it's so beautiful.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.409
It's so extravagant.

03:21.492 --> 03:22.785
Well, it's yours.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.621
I don't want
any arguments here, okay?

03:24.704 --> 03:26.956
(laughs)

03:28.875 --> 03:30.335
Thank you.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.419
I love it.

03:31.502 --> 03:32.795
I love you.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.252
Mm, glad you like it--
I'm writing it for you.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.920
Well, that's sweet.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.423
You know, it's funny,
I just got another royalty check

05:40.506 --> 05:42.550
from the song I did
for Jasper's Law,

05:42.633 --> 05:44.969
{\an3}I'm writing my
own music, and...

05:45.053 --> 05:46.971
{\an3}basically, I'm doing
whatever I want to do,

05:47.055 --> 05:48.347
and for the first time,

05:48.431 --> 05:50.391
in a long time, I...

05:50.475 --> 05:53.519
I-I feel like I'm headed in
the right direction, you know?

05:53.603 --> 05:55.104
David, I'm happy for you.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.105
I'm happy for us.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.108
Even though I'm the one
who's doing your taxes.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.069
Hey, hey, you offered--
don't forget.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.445
I know.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.447
Oh, listen, guess
who I met today?

06:04.530 --> 06:06.783
{\an1}Who?
Kyle Scott.

06:06.866 --> 06:07.950
Who's he?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.411
He's the one who won all
those film festivals last year.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.455
{\an1}He's, like, one of the hottest
new filmmakers right now.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.457
And he wants to meet you.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.793
Really? Why?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.669
{\an1}Because he's a big fan--
he loves your music,

06:18.753 --> 06:20.338
{\an1}and he wants
to work with you.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.131
{\an1}And I kind of
slipped him your tape,

06:22.215 --> 06:23.966
{\an1}and you have a meeting
with him today.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.468
Wait a second.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.303
{\an3}First you get me
a record deal,

06:27.387 --> 06:28.971
then you do my taxes,

06:29.055 --> 06:32.100
{\an3}and now you set me up
to score a movie?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.477
{\an3}You know, I really
might have to think of

06:34.560 --> 06:36.270
{\an3}some way of
saying thank you.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.147
Well, you already have.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.691
Hmm.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.868
Kelly, Kelly, talk to my mom,

06:50.952 --> 06:52.453
tell her I can stay.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.080
{\an1}Please tell her
I can stay.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.500
What's going on, Chris?

06:57.583 --> 06:58.501
My schedule's been changed.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.754
I can't drive Chris to work
at night anymore.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.964
I don't care.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.841
I have to have my own job.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.509
{\an1}If I don't,
I won't be able

07:06.592 --> 07:07.718
to get my own apartment.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.138
{\an1}And if I can't do that,
I'll be mad!

07:10.221 --> 07:11.264
{\an1}KELLY:
Okay, you can't come

07:11.347 --> 07:13.641
{\an3}to the night shift anymore--
what about the day shift?

07:13.724 --> 07:15.351
{\an3}Can you drive Chris
during the day?

07:15.434 --> 07:16.519
I really can't
discuss this right now.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.020
I'm late for work.
Come on, honey.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.814
{\an3}Let's go.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.315
{\an1}KELLY:
You know, I could call

07:21.399 --> 07:23.359
the director and see
if there is a day job.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.027
Chris,

07:25.111 --> 07:27.864
{\an3}do you want me to get fired,
and we both lose our jobs?

07:27.947 --> 07:30.533
I'm not leaving.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.577
Okay, why don't I just call
and see if the director's in?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.036
I know you're trying
to help, Ms. Taylor,

07:34.120 --> 07:35.371
but you aren't.

07:35.454 --> 07:36.873
{\an3}So, please, if
you don't mind...

07:36.956 --> 07:39.500
Okay.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.253
{\an3}Don't worry, everything's
gonna be okay.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.462
You promise?

07:43.546 --> 07:44.422
I promise.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.634
{\an1}Kelly will make it
all right.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.600
(knocking)

07:55.683 --> 07:57.059
KYLE:
Yes?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.519
{\an1}David!
Hey.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.937
Hey, what's happening, man?
How's it going man?

08:00.021 --> 08:01.731
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you, too.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.774
I've got to tell you, man,
I love that song of yours.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.026
Got some serious airplay.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.278
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, I got
my 15 minutes of fame.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.363
Believe me, I know
what that's like.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.406
So, man, they
must be throwing deals

08:10.489 --> 08:11.532
at you left and right, huh?

08:11.616 --> 08:14.327
{\an3}Yeah, well, there's
been a couple.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.411
But to be honest with you,

08:15.494 --> 08:17.455
{\an3}I'm really trying to make
my own thing, you know?

08:17.538 --> 08:18.706
You know what, I feel you--

08:18.789 --> 08:20.291
{\an1}I've been thinking
the exact same thing.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.585
{\an1}Except for this film thing--
I mean, that sounds cool.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.544
Film?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.421
Yeah, Valerie told me.

08:25.504 --> 08:26.797
It's a commercial, not a film.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.424
{\an3}A commercial?
Yeah.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.468
Dry &amp; Happy Deodorant--
a national spot.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.261
{\an3}We're talking about
some serious cash flow.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.389
Um... I'm sorry, I-I thought...

08:36.474 --> 08:39.309
Visuals are already shot.

08:39.393 --> 08:42.938
{\an3}Why don't you take a look,
see what you think.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.941
All right, thanks.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.317
Hey, David.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.902
Yeah?

08:47.985 --> 08:49.362
Everybody's got to eat.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.197
Yeah.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.160
VALERIE:
<i>Thanks.</i>

08:59.497 --> 09:00.414
{\an1}KELLY:
Ooh, you weren't kidding.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.791
{\an1}This is the most
beautiful bracelet

09:01.874 --> 09:02.959
I've ever seen.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.418
Ooh, ladies' lunch?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.921
I didn't get my invitation.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.673
Wow! Is that from Noah?

09:08.756 --> 09:11.175
No, I just ran out
and bought it myself.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.551
Can I see it?

09:12.635 --> 09:13.636
Wow, it's beautiful.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.263
Looks like an antique.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.140
I'd say they're worth,
mm, ten, twenty grand.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.601
Ten, twenty thousand?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.687
Well, give or take a little--
but we are talking about Noah.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.064
Well, I don't really care
what it costs.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.065
Well, the value of a diamond is

09:26.148 --> 09:27.817
the perfect indication
of a man's affection.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.361
That is absurd-- what if
your man can't afford diamonds?

09:30.444 --> 09:31.862
That's something only you
should worry about, Kelly.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.031
Ooh, I think
someone's a little jealous.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.450
No, unlike you,
I'm just curious.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.369
{\an4}KELLY:
Anyway, I think
that you should

09:38.452 --> 09:39.829
have it appraised,
get some insurance.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.330
I mean, this <i> is</i> L.A.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.832
I don't know,
that seems so shallow.

09:42.915 --> 09:43.833
{\an3}VALERIE:
I know a jeweler.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.376
I'll set it up for you.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.336
{\an1}VALERIE (groans):
Well, ladies...

09:47.420 --> 09:49.338
I got to go back to work.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.132
Her pimp must've paged her.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.470
{\an5}PETER:
<i>You're younger</i>
<i>than I thought, Brandon.</i>

09:56.554 --> 09:58.472
{\an1}Well, so are you,
to be honest.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.849
{\an1}With all the awards
you've won...

09:59.932 --> 10:02.518
{\an6}(chuckles):
You thought I was gonna be
some gray-haired old man.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.478
{\an1}Yeah, sort of.
(chuckles)

10:04.562 --> 10:07.023
{\an3}Well, I got
an early start.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.984
{\an3}I started working at <i> The</i>
<i>Times</i> when I was 1.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.861
{\an1}No kidding, you started
working at <i> The Times</i>

10:11.944 --> 10:14.864
{\an3}when you were 19, huh?
Mm-hmm.

10:14.947 --> 10:15.698
{\an3}Of course, you know
the drill,

10:15.781 --> 10:17.867
{\an3}I had to do
all the local stories,

10:17.950 --> 10:19.368
the human-interest pieces,
nothing important.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.536
I know what you're saying.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.873
I've been at the same
weekly paper for some time now.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.374
What keeps you there?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.501
(exhales)

10:28.627 --> 10:30.504
So, about the stadium.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.507
I'm all for bringing
professional football

10:33.591 --> 10:35.843
back to Los Angeles,
but I don't think the taxpayers

10:35.926 --> 10:37.428
should have to pay for it.

10:37.511 --> 10:38.262
That's pretty clear
from your articles.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.263
Which are first-rate,
by the way.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.225
As you can see, I did do
quite a bit of research.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.399
You mind if I borrow this?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.235
In exchange
for a shared byline, of course.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.904
You and me? Shared byline?

10:54.987 --> 10:56.405
<i>News Today?</i>

10:56.489 --> 10:57.239
What do you say?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.200
It depends.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.202
Whose name comes first?

11:01.285 --> 11:02.328
(chuckles)

11:02.411 --> 11:03.704
Mine.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.081
(chuckles)

11:05.164 --> 11:07.375
Okay, twist my arm,
you got a deal.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.627
{\an1}(chuckles)

11:11.629 --> 11:13.631
(knocking)

11:19.512 --> 11:20.638
{\an3}Hi, Kelly.
Hi.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.306
You want to see
my collection?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.433
{\an3}I've got all the Kings--
I even got

11:24.517 --> 11:25.935
{\an3}the Zamboni card.
Oh, wow,

11:26.018 --> 11:26.894
very impressive.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.064
Hi.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.066
I have great news.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.276
{\an1}Not only is there
a day job open,

11:34.360 --> 11:35.653
{\an1}but Chris can
start tomorrow.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.113
Uh, don't you think

11:37.196 --> 11:39.281
you should have talked
to me about this first?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.367
Well, that's what I'm doing.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.411
{\an3}Working the night shift
is one thing.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.288
Working the day shift,
with all the added pressures

11:46.372 --> 11:47.832
of being in a crowded clinic,

11:47.915 --> 11:49.333
it's an entirely
different matter.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.419
{\an3}I know, but...
No, no, you don't.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.504
Chris is the kindest,
sweetest person on the planet,

11:53.587 --> 11:55.506
{\an3}and he'd run
over hot coals for you.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.299
But he's slow.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.592
He needs extra help.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.344
{\an3}That's why he
had a job coach before.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.097
{\an3}Why would I want
to put him in a situation

12:03.180 --> 12:04.473
where he might get overwhelmed?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.267
I would never let
anything like that happen.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.685
No, not intentionally.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.443
(sighs)
Honey,

12:15.526 --> 12:16.819
Kelly has gotten you

12:16.902 --> 12:18.362
a day job at the clinic.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.655
What do you think about that?

12:19.738 --> 12:20.823
Really?

12:20.906 --> 12:22.283
Can I? Can I, please?

12:22.366 --> 12:23.492
I can do it.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.369
I can do that.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.163
{\an1}KELLY:
Don't worry.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.081
Everything will be great,
I promise.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.015
I redecorated a bit.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.016
You don't mind?

12:47.099 --> 12:48.517
No.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.102
{\an1}Huh.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.149
Wow.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.192
I can change it back.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.276
This stuff is all returnable.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.195
Nah.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.822
It's great. It's...

13:01.906 --> 13:03.866
Where'd my Shaq poster go?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.868
The basketball poster?

13:05.951 --> 13:07.495
{\an1}You want me
to put that back up?

13:07.578 --> 13:08.746
You didn't throw
it away, right?

13:08.829 --> 13:10.539
I mean, that was
a signed piece.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.042
It's in your closet, silly.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.252
{\an1}I would never throw
anything of yours away.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.714
Now make love
to me, Steven,

13:18.797 --> 13:22.343
{\an3}on our new
satin sheets.

13:22.426 --> 13:23.344
Satin?

13:23.427 --> 13:24.345
Uh-huh.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.888
(growls playfully)

13:25.971 --> 13:27.556
(chuckles)

13:28.682 --> 13:30.351
{\an1}I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.102
{\an3}Oh, come on, you know
you want to know.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.396
For insurance purposes only.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.856
Right. Why else?

13:35.940 --> 13:39.068
{\an3}So how much do you
think they're worth?

13:39.151 --> 13:42.488
Oh, roughly 20, maybe 25.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.697
Thousand, right?

13:43.781 --> 13:46.283
No, these are paste.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.785
Not even cubic zirconia.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.703
I'm, I'm really sorry

13:49.787 --> 13:51.372
to disappoint you.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.083
Either your boyfriend
was seriously misled or...

13:54.166 --> 13:56.585
Or he doesn't love you as
much as you think he did.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.836
Look, I know

13:57.920 --> 13:59.296
how Noah feels about me.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.048
It doesn't matter whether
this thing is real or not.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.550
{\an1}Thank you.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.551
I'll be right back.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.886
{\an3}You know, I almost
believe you.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.473
(knocking)

14:09.557 --> 14:12.101
Hey. Hey, how'd it go?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.561
(sighs)

14:13.644 --> 14:15.020
Uh, it wasn't a film.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.731
It was a commercial.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.941
A deodorant commercial.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.276
What do you think

14:20.359 --> 14:21.485
I am, Valerie, huh?
Some hack musician

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
that's willing to do
anything for a buck?

14:23.320 --> 14:25.197
David, I'm sorry.
I didn't know,

14:25.281 --> 14:26.407
{\an1}I swear.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.158
But what's wrong
with doing a commercial?

14:28.242 --> 14:29.410
I don't do armpit music.

14:29.493 --> 14:30.411
That's what's wrong.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.453
Do me a favor, okay?

14:31.537 --> 14:34.456
Don't do me any more favors.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.469
CHRIS:
<i>The white form goes</i>

14:47.553 --> 14:48.429
in the blue file.

14:48.512 --> 14:49.597
(phones ringing)
Mm-hmm.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.933
{\an1}The yellow form
goes in the red file.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.311
{\an1}And the carbon
goes in the trash.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.979
Very good.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.314
{\an3}Think you can
handle another job?

14:58.397 --> 15:00.107
Lay it on me.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.317
(chuckles):
Okay.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.652
{\an3}You see that file
cabinet over there?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.529
Top copy goes in
the top drawer,

15:05.613 --> 15:07.323
the bottom copy goes
in the bottom drawer.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.451
Top in the top
and bottom in the bottom.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.827
You're the best.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.954
Here you go.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.000
Your Zamboni card.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.001
This is your favorite.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.336
I want you to have it.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.379
Thank you.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.797
{\an3}I'll take good
care of it.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.507
Thank you.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.425
For everything.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.263
She stuck Shaq
in the closet?

15:31.347 --> 15:33.307
{\an5}Oh, yeah.
But that thing
is autographed.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.308
STEVE:
Tell me about it.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.476
And the sex-- ah!

15:35.559 --> 15:37.519
Right in the middle
of a good bounce,

15:37.603 --> 15:39.730
she stops to relight a candle
that blew out.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.398
I think
she's more in love with

15:41.482 --> 15:43.984
the idea of being in love
than with me.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.904
Steve, you suffer, I suffer.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.739
Thanks.
Why don't you say something?

15:48.822 --> 15:51.492
I-I'm going to.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.534
I'd start with
the "Steven" thing.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.369
She calls you Steven?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.245
I already spoke
to her about that.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.206
{\an6}JILL:
Steven?
Mm.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.166
Hi.
Hey.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.084
{\an3}Mmm.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.544
{\an5}I have a surprise
for you.
What's that?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.213
{\an3}I got us tickets
to the opera.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.422
<i>Madame Butterfl!</i>

16:05.506 --> 16:06.924
{\an3}You haven't seen it.
Me?

16:07.007 --> 16:07.925
STEVE:
Not yet.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.176
JILL:
You do like opera?

16:09.259 --> 16:10.636
Because I don't want
to force you.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.221
{\an1}(deep voice):
Oh, yes, I love opera.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.222
Good.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.598
Oh, Steven's a big fan.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.354
(both laugh)

16:22.189 --> 16:24.566
Hey.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.069
{\an3}Look, um, I know it
wasn't your fault, okay?

16:27.152 --> 16:28.070
And I'm sorry.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.406
David, if I would have known...

16:30.489 --> 16:31.407
Forget about it.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.741
I want to take
you to lunch.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.744
{\an3}I just got another royalty
check from Jasper's Law.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.454
Well, I-I hope
it's a really big one.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.580
Uh-oh.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.249
Uh, those wouldn't be my taxes?

16:40.332 --> 16:41.417
{\an1}Yeah.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.627
You know when you sold your half
of the After Dark to Noah?

16:43.711 --> 16:44.920
Well, you never paid taxes

16:45.003 --> 16:47.548
on the money
you loaned yourself as salary.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.549
So?

16:49.508 --> 16:50.426
But he assumed all debt

16:50.509 --> 16:51.427
when he bought me out.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.636
And when he did,

16:52.720 --> 16:54.054
the loans became
debt forgiveness income.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.932
Okay, how much?

16:57.015 --> 16:58.475
About $8,300.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.227
That's impossible.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.478
There's got to be...

17:01.562 --> 17:03.439
David, I've been over this
and over this.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.356
Well, Val, I can't
afford this much.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.942
Well, how much was
your royalty check for?

17:07.025 --> 17:10.445
$975.42.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.325
One step forward
and two steps back.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.289
{\an3}Brandon, it's nice of you
to include me, but...

17:20.372 --> 17:21.749
Oh, wait, here he is.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.625
{\an4}Hey, Peter,
how you doing?
Brandon.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.127
{\an4}This is, uh,
Kelly Taylor.
Hi.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.252
Kelly, good to meet you.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.378
Nice to meet you.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.256
{\an3}So you're never gonna guess
where I just came from.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.799
Where?
Tom Rosen's house.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.801
{\an1}I've been trying to get
a meeting with Tom for weeks.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.303
How'd you swing that?
Turns out, the guy's

17:34.386 --> 17:35.888
a fan of my work, I guess.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.514
No accounting for taste.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.308
{\an5}(laughs)
Uh, Tom's one of
the wealthiest

17:39.391 --> 17:41.268
developers in the country.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.728
He owns a hockey team,
basketball team.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.313
Right, the guy
who's building the stadium.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.190
Yeah. Did you pin him down on

17:46.273 --> 17:47.816
what his proposed enterprise
zone is gonna cost the city?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.318
I'm working on it.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.903
He's taking me up in
the Gulfstream this afternoon.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.488
{\an3}So how about you?
Did you get that info?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.031
Yeah.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.157
Comparisons from
the last five years,

17:55.240 --> 17:57.993
{\an1}every new stadium built
in a major metropolitan area.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.870
Numbers don't look pretty.

17:59.953 --> 18:00.913
{\an3}Excellent.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.289
Excellent!

18:02.372 --> 18:04.208
It's going to be
a hell of a story, Brandon.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.209
Could be the cover.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.002
Cover of <i> News Today.</i>

18:07.086 --> 18:08.462
But remember,

18:08.545 --> 18:10.047
my name comes first.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.509
So, I think I have
a good idea for a story.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.302
She's a gold mine.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.763
There's this guy
at work-- Chris.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.641
He's developmentally disabled,
but he works full-time.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.100
He does a great job.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.394
He's thinking of moving
into his own place--

18:24.478 --> 18:26.021
this supportive
living apartment

18:26.105 --> 18:27.898
with a team to help him
and everything.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.024
It's really amazing.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.859
Does sound like a good story.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.194
Little soft for my taste.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.570
But you're right.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.197
{\an3}I mean, it's,
it's interesting,

18:35.280 --> 18:36.365
it's heartfelt.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.825
For a human interest piece.

18:37.908 --> 18:38.992
KELLY:
What do you think?

18:39.076 --> 18:39.993
You want to meet him?

18:40.077 --> 18:40.994
I'm sure he'd love to.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.037
He's a hockey fan, like you.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.206
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.375
{\an1}I'll, uh, I-I'll see him
sometime next week.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.752
Okay.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.379
Um, Peter,
it was nice meeting you.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.422
I have to get back
to the clinic.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.050
{\an3}BRANDON:
Excuse me.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.427
Kel, why are you
leaving so soon?

18:57.511 --> 18:58.804
Don't patronize me, Brandon.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.430
So the guy's a little arrogant.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.765
He's won two Pulitzers.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.350
He didn't want to talk to me.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.393
That is not what was happening.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.229
No, you were just too busy
sucking up to notice.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.615
{\an5}(groans)
Okay, okay,
that's it.

19:23.662 --> 19:24.580
Was that okay?

19:24.663 --> 19:25.914
{\an3}Was I allowed
to do that?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.207
Oh, it was fine.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.542
{\an3}Oh, good.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.751
'Cause I was worried.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.752
No, don't worry.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.087
You're great with kids.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.548
Chris, did you file these?

19:34.631 --> 19:36.633
Because I found these
in the patients' folders.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.761
I asked you a question, Chris.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.972
I thought you said
I was doing good.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.015
No, you are.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.308
We just need to know if you...

19:44.391 --> 19:47.060
Made a mistake, right?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.270
Don't you make mistakes?

19:48.353 --> 19:49.313
Yes.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.314
Nobody's blaming you, Chris.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.691
The drawer was full.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.318
There wasn't any room.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.736
I didn't know what to do.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.446
Then you ask somebody.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.447
It was my fault.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.073
I didn't explain.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.366
My mom was right.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.910
This job's too complicated.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.119
Just fire me.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.370
{\an3}No, no, nobody is
gonna fire you.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.080
Leave me alone!
Chris.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.415
Just leave me alone!

20:08.498 --> 20:09.666
Chris.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.627
Chris, come back.
This wasn't your fault.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.466
It wasn't his fault,
it was mine.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.019
No, no,
don't-don't take it off yet.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.312
Why?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.147
Because...

20:32.230 --> 20:33.148
Go on, open it.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.566
They're a set.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.818
Oh, Noah.

20:46.244 --> 20:48.246
Let me help you with it.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.679
{\an1}I don't know much
about jewelry,

21:03.762 --> 21:06.515
{\an1}but they really look
beautiful on you.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.518
You shouldn't have.

21:09.601 --> 21:13.021
{\an3}I mean it, you really
shouldn't have.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.357
You don't like them?

21:15.440 --> 21:18.735
No, I love them.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.487
But you don't need
to buy me jewelry

21:20.570 --> 21:23.073
to show how you
feel about me.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.408
{\an1}But I think
it's a perfect reflection

21:24.491 --> 21:27.244
of how I do feel about you.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.745
You do?

21:28.829 --> 21:29.997
Yeah.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.665
{\an1}That's why
I gave them to you.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.502
You know?

21:35.585 --> 21:37.587
(both chuckle)

21:41.466 --> 21:43.343
(door opens)

21:43.427 --> 21:45.345
{\an6}The voices were
incredible.
Heavenly.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.222
{\an1}Hey. How was
<i>Madame Butterfly?</i>

21:47.305 --> 21:49.224
Ah, staggering.

21:49.307 --> 21:50.434
I never wanted
to see it end.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.019
Yeah, it was great.
You hated it.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.438
{\an1}Oh, what are you
talking about?

21:54.521 --> 21:55.856
{\an3}Okay, if you
liked it that much,

21:55.939 --> 21:57.399
I have the CD upstairs.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.276
Oh.

22:13.040 --> 22:13.999
Hey, where you been?

22:14.082 --> 22:15.625
I've been calling you.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.377
Out looking for Chris.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.212
Who's Chris?

22:19.296 --> 22:21.214
{\an3}The guy I told you
about at lunch.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.215
Oh.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.383
I gave him too much to do.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.552
{\an3}He had a meltdown,
he went running off.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.471
{\an3}Did you find him?
Yeah, finally.

22:27.554 --> 22:30.182
{\an3}At the restaurant where
his mom waitresses.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.059
{\an3}But I just looked at them
through the window.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.102
I didn't have the
guts to face her.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.481
Why?

22:37.564 --> 22:38.690
Because I blew it.

22:38.774 --> 22:43.403
I promised her that nothing
would go wrong, and it did.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.280
{\an1}You were just
trying to help.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.282
(typing)

22:47.365 --> 22:49.409
Yeah.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.413
I don't know.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.206
(sighs)

22:54.289 --> 22:56.291
{\an3}It's more than that,
it's everything.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.542
It's us.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.838
I just feel like...

23:01.922 --> 23:03.965
we're headed
in different directions.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.926
Different directions?

23:06.009 --> 23:07.344
I have eyes, Brandon.

23:07.427 --> 23:10.430
I can see how badly you want
a career like Peter's.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.474
And I don't want
to hold you back.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.683
{\an3}I feel like
I already did

23:13.767 --> 23:17.479
when I got shot, and you turned
down that job in San Diego.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.189
I know that that was
because of me.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.149
I have no regrets
about that decision.

23:22.567 --> 23:23.610
I love you, Kelly.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.821
I know that you love me,

23:25.904 --> 23:28.365
but I also know
that you love your work.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.658
Is there something wrong
with that?

23:29.741 --> 23:32.494
No, no.

23:32.577 --> 23:36.373
It's just painful knowing
that you're not happy here

23:36.456 --> 23:37.374
with what you're doing.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.334
I never said I was unhappy.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.211
You don't have to, Brandon.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.213
It's written all over your face.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.849
(seagulls calling)

23:53.932 --> 23:55.475
(knock at door)

23:55.559 --> 23:57.102
Yes, the line
will definitely be ready.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.062
Can you hang on a second?
Thanks.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.524
Hey! Where's Kelly?

24:02.607 --> 24:04.734
{\an1}Well, she's where she is
everyday: at work.

24:04.818 --> 24:05.986
I'm on the phone here.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.362
{\an3}Well, will you
give her this? I found it

24:07.445 --> 24:08.655
in my laundry.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.532
{\an3}She must have left it
over at Brandon's.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.410
You came all the way over here
just to return a sweater?

24:13.493 --> 24:14.369
Why else?

24:14.452 --> 24:16.830
Huh. You're pathetic.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.541
{\an3}Well, speaking
of pathetic, uh...

24:19.624 --> 24:20.750
What did Noah say
when you told him

24:20.834 --> 24:22.502
his rocks were
worthless, huh?

24:22.586 --> 24:24.379
{\an3}I didn't. Now,
I'm on the phone.

24:24.462 --> 24:26.339
Afraid of what he might say?

24:26.423 --> 24:29.384
Look, I'm sorry to disappoint
you, Val. Noah loves me.

24:29.467 --> 24:32.554
In fact, he asked me
to move in with him.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.015
Well, why buy the cow when you
can get the milk for free?

24:35.098 --> 24:36.558
(mock laughter)

24:36.641 --> 24:37.350
Hello? Hi.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.019
I am so sorry. Yeah.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.562
Can you just hang on
a few more moments?

24:40.645 --> 24:43.356
Yeah, the termite
inspector is here.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.401
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

24:46.484 --> 24:48.737
What's this?

24:48.820 --> 24:51.448
Ooh. More paste, huh?

24:52.449 --> 24:54.117
One, hands off.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.202
{\an3}Two, how do you
know they're fake?

24:55.285 --> 24:58.288
Well, why don't we get it
appraised and find out?

24:58.371 --> 25:01.041
Why don't you, I don't know,
get the hell out of here?

25:01.124 --> 25:02.209
Aren't you sensitive?

25:02.292 --> 25:03.543
{\an1}Look, I'm just trying
to help out.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.587
You don't want to fool yourself
into thinking

25:05.670 --> 25:08.215
that Noah cares about you
more than he really does.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.009
Right. Well, Val, thank you
so much for dropping by.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.512
Oh, don't forget your broom
on the way out.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.477
{\an3}See you later.
Mm-hmm.

25:20.560 --> 25:25.440
{\an1}Hi, I'm so... Hello?
(door closes)

25:25.523 --> 25:27.567
Hello?

25:29.152 --> 25:32.405
So I'm going with Rosen to watch
the Kings work out tomorrow.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.157
{\an1}See if I can get him
to open up a little bit more.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.409
You should come. Man said
we could get on the ice.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.787
{\an3}Skate with the Kings? I might
just take you up on that.

25:38.870 --> 25:43.291
Do. And you wouldn't be opposed
to me mentioning your name

25:43.375 --> 25:45.460
to some of my editor friends
back in New York, would you?

25:45.543 --> 25:48.129
{\an3}Opposed? No,
I don't think so.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.506
Good.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.632
See you later.
See you.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.301
That was Peter Raitt.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.136
{\an3}Yeah, gracing
our humble rag.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.513
{\an3}Mm-hmm.
What an honor.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.974
Is something wrong, Steven?

25:59.057 --> 26:01.977
{\an3}Yeah, something's wrong,
Brandon.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.520
I've got to break up
with Jill.

26:03.603 --> 26:06.273
She wants to take me
to the ballet.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.316
The ballet? Not good.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.027
{\an3}So, why don't you just
break up with her?

26:11.111 --> 26:12.612
Well it's not
as easy as that, Janet.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.322
There's feelings involved.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.032
She's crazy about me.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.159
Oh, I think you're missing
the big picture here, Steven.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.327
Oh?

26:19.411 --> 26:20.495
You see, you actually

26:20.578 --> 26:21.621
have the opportunity

26:21.705 --> 26:24.666
to break up with a woman
before she breaks up with you.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.209
This could change your life.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.460
You've never broken up
with someone?

26:27.544 --> 26:30.505
Of course I have. And if you
call me Steven one more time...

26:30.588 --> 26:31.840
Then name one, Stevie.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.759
Mm...

26:36.928 --> 26:39.639
I'm not going to submit
to this kind of pressure tactic.

26:40.598 --> 26:41.516
Well, I actually think

26:41.599 --> 26:42.684
it's very sweet.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.894
Sweet, maybe.
Pathetic, definitely.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.022
I've got to break up
with this woman.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.565
The only question is, how?

26:53.320 --> 26:54.279
I'm so sorry for what
happened, Mrs. Meyers.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.698
You have to know it was
my fault, not Chris's.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.533
No, it wasn't all your fault.

26:58.616 --> 26:59.784
I let you talk me into it.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.705
Is there any chance that he'll
be coming back to the clinic?

27:03.788 --> 27:06.416
Well, it's, uh...
really up to Chris.

27:06.499 --> 27:09.377
ANNOUNCER (in video game):
What a shot. Goal!

27:09.461 --> 27:12.088
(crowd cheering in game)

27:13.590 --> 27:15.717
How did he get
to be such a big hockey fan?

27:15.800 --> 27:16.718
{\an1}His brother
played hockey--

27:16.801 --> 27:19.346
used to take him
to the ice rink all the time--

27:19.429 --> 27:21.431
but he lives in Boston now.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.351
Chris misses him a lot.

27:24.434 --> 27:28.146
{\an1}Unfortunately, there are
no teams for guys like Chris.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.940
{\an1}You know, Miss Taylor,
my son has had

27:31.024 --> 27:32.400
his fair share
of disappointments,

27:32.484 --> 27:36.196
and I really don't want him
to have any more.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.656
I'm sorry.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.540
Listen, Jill.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.459
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

27:49.542 --> 27:52.379
And I care about you deeply.

27:52.462 --> 27:55.423
But I'm in a stage in my life

27:55.507 --> 27:59.219
where I just can't commit
to one woman.

27:59.302 --> 28:01.554
No. Don't go there.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.098
You need to keep it
focused on her.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.266
Okay.
Okay.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.601
Um...

28:08.812 --> 28:10.480
Look, I care about you
an awful lot,

28:10.563 --> 28:12.607
but we can't be together
any longer.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.402
I'm sorry we have to break up.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.405
But Steven, you can't.
I love you.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.115
I know.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.783
I know it-it's gonna be hard.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.910
Probably the hardest thing
you'll ever have to do,

28:23.993 --> 28:26.079
but I want you
to forget about me.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.622
{\an5}(laughing):
The hardest thing
you'll ever have to do?

28:27.705 --> 28:29.290
Mm... Too much?

28:29.374 --> 28:31.084
Yeah.
You want to keep it simple.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.794
Okay? Just straightforward.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.546
Hmm.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.424
Listen, Jill...

28:37.507 --> 28:39.342
{\an1}I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

28:39.426 --> 28:40.677
This sounds serious.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.138
{\an1}It is.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.472
And...

28:46.516 --> 28:47.475
Uh...

28:50.562 --> 28:52.480
I don't want to go
to the ballet tonight.

28:52.564 --> 28:56.651
Okay. Can I ask why?

28:56.734 --> 28:59.028
Because...

29:01.698 --> 29:04.993
I feel terrible about this.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.370
You forgot, didn't you?

29:07.454 --> 29:09.372
{\an3}It's okay.

29:09.456 --> 29:13.042
You are present enough.

29:16.629 --> 29:19.048
{\an3}Happy one-month
anniversary.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.427
One-month anniversary?

29:25.763 --> 29:27.515
You remembered?

29:27.599 --> 29:30.059
Open it.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.522
Do you like it?

29:34.606 --> 29:35.899
Do I like it?

29:40.278 --> 29:41.529
I love it.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.459
(knocking at door)

30:00.423 --> 30:01.549
Ugh. What now?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.718
{\an1}Well, I have
something else to return.

30:03.801 --> 30:05.386
I had it appraised for you.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.554
You stole my necklace?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.932
It's fake,
just like the bracelet.

30:09.015 --> 30:10.141
I should have you arrested.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.644
Don't displace your anger on me.
It's Noah who's taking you

30:12.727 --> 30:13.978
{\an1}for a fool.
Get out of here.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.605
{\an4}You're going
to thank me one day.
Out!

30:18.024 --> 30:20.068
(sighs)

30:23.196 --> 30:25.281
{\an1}Tomorrow is going to be
so great, Brandon.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.075
You should have heard
how excited Chris was

30:27.158 --> 30:28.076
when I called him.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.536
How about his mother?
Well, she's skeptical.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.955
{\an1}But she knows how much
it would mean to him

30:32.038 --> 30:33.748
{\an1}to get on the ice
with the Kings.

30:33.831 --> 30:35.250
You sure it's okay?

30:35.333 --> 30:37.418
Yeah. I checked with
Peter this afternoon.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.420
He said it was fine.
The more the merrier.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.422
{\an3}I just don't understand
where he is.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.716
{\an3}I mean, he said to meet
him here an hour ago.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.427
{\an3}He had something
important to tell me.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.929
Oh, here he is.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.098
{\an3}Hey, Peter.
What's going on?

30:50.181 --> 30:51.432
{\an4}Brandon. Kelly.
How are you?
Hi.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.268
Uh, sorry to keep you waiting,

30:53.351 --> 30:54.936
{\an1}but you're never going to
believe what just happened.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.729
A source close
to the President

30:56.813 --> 30:59.440
is going to resign, and he's
going to reveal his reasons

30:59.524 --> 31:01.067
to me, and only me.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.278
All right? I mean this
is way too juicy to pass up,

31:03.361 --> 31:07.532
so I got to catch a plane
for D.C. I'll call you.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.828
Peter?

31:11.911 --> 31:13.913
Taxi.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.665
(bellhop whistles)

31:15.748 --> 31:17.292
BRANDON:
Hey, Peter.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.543
What about our story?

31:18.626 --> 31:21.588
I'm going to have to put this
one on the back burner, Brandon.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.131
It was good working
with you, though.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.424
And, uh, sorry
about the skating thing.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.342
{\an1}But we already told Chris
that he could go.

31:26.426 --> 31:29.178
BRANDON: Yeah.
What can I say?

31:29.262 --> 31:30.471
I owe you one.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.600
{\an1}Peter, you can't
do this to the kid.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.476
You want me to give up the
biggest scoop of the year

31:35.560 --> 31:37.020
so your retarded friend
can go skating?

31:37.103 --> 31:39.314
I think that would be the
right thing to do, yeah.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.482
Well, I misjudged you, Brandon.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.818
I thought you were
a real journalist.

31:43.901 --> 31:45.945
I thought you knew
about priorities.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.161
Don't say it.

31:55.538 --> 31:57.540
I told you so.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.835
(keyboard playing
upbeat music)

32:09.093 --> 32:11.471
{\an3}Is that Beethoven
or Mozart?

32:11.554 --> 32:13.473
No, it's armpit music, actually.

32:13.556 --> 32:14.807
Oh.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.351
You are doing the
commercial, huh?

32:16.434 --> 32:17.894
Do I have a choice?

32:17.977 --> 32:20.813
Well, considering that
it's almost April 15th,

32:20.897 --> 32:23.191
{\an3}and the IRS can severely
screw up your life...

32:23.274 --> 32:24.692
No, not really.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.487
Well, then,
it's armpit music for me.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.406
I call this little ditty,
"Don't Cry, Just Keep Me Dry."

32:30.490 --> 32:31.366
(playing upbeat song)

32:31.449 --> 32:32.575
Very catchy.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.370
{\an1}Oh, there's more
where that came from.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.164
Look, David, there's no shame
in making a living.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.542
Everybody compromises.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.545
Val, I'm playing
"Ode To An Aerosol" here.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.172
If there was another way...

32:46.255 --> 32:48.299
Well, there isn't, is there?

32:51.636 --> 32:53.262
(sighs)

32:53.346 --> 32:55.598
(playing spirited tune)

33:00.311 --> 33:04.440
Noah, I've been trying really
hard to think of a tactful way

33:04.524 --> 33:06.693
to say what I'm about to say.

33:06.776 --> 33:10.488
{\an3}And I can't, so I'm just
going to come out and say it.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.782
I had the jewelry appraised.

33:12.865 --> 33:15.660
For insurance purposes only.

33:17.745 --> 33:19.580
{\an3}They're fake.
Did you know that?

33:19.664 --> 33:23.126
The diamonds aren't real, but
they're not fake, I assure you.

33:23.209 --> 33:24.460
So, you knew?

33:24.544 --> 33:25.586
Of course I knew.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.046
You think I got ripped off?

33:27.130 --> 33:29.549
But you...

33:29.632 --> 33:32.552
You said that the jewelry
was a perfect reflection

33:32.635 --> 33:34.470
of the way you feel about me.

33:35.555 --> 33:36.597
They're fake.

33:38.474 --> 33:39.934
I'm starting to think
it's more of a reflection

33:40.017 --> 33:41.102
of how you feel about me.

33:41.185 --> 33:44.939
Did you ask me to move in
with you out of convenience?

33:45.022 --> 33:47.775
Don't accuse me of undervaluing
this relationship.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.402
You're the one
that's sitting here trashing it.

33:49.485 --> 33:51.279
What are you talking about?

33:51.362 --> 33:52.780
I'm not the one that gave you
something worthless

33:52.864 --> 33:53.990
and then passed it off
as valuable.

33:54.073 --> 33:55.491
Tell you something.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.202
My grandmother
on my mom's side was dirt poor.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.287
That's the only jewelry
she ever owned.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.956
{\an1}It was the only thing
she gave to me.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.500
She didn't think
it was worthless.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.669
Neither do I.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.809
I can't believe I'm going
to disappoint him again.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.811
{\an1}Could he be
any more excited?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.103
Hi.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.813
Hi.
(chuckling)

34:26.898 --> 34:30.485
Chris woke up at 5:30, bounded
into my room, ready to skate.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.362
He made breakfast to go
for all of us.

34:33.446 --> 34:36.157
{\an3}Chris, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.868
We're not going to be able
to go skating with the Kings.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.536
No skating?

34:41.411 --> 34:42.455
I'm so sorry.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.166
But you promised me.

34:45.248 --> 34:47.126
You promised.

34:49.879 --> 34:53.632
Come on. Go back inside. We'll
find something fun to do, okay?

34:53.716 --> 34:55.467
I want to go skating.
I know, I know.

34:55.551 --> 34:56.594
Hey, guys!

34:56.677 --> 34:59.847
{\an5}BRANDON:
Guys! Who said anything
about not skating?

34:59.931 --> 35:03.518
I happen to know the owner of
one of the least used ice rinks

35:03.601 --> 35:05.144
in Los Angeles.
You do?

35:05.228 --> 35:06.521
{\an1}Yes, I do.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.689
{\an1}And he told me that he would
clear the ice for me

35:08.773 --> 35:10.691
{\an1}any time I wanted.
You know what?

35:10.775 --> 35:11.984
{\an1}I kind of feel like
going skating.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.402
So what do you say

35:13.486 --> 35:15.363
you and I go skate
on our own private rink, huh?

35:15.446 --> 35:19.325
Can we, Mom, please?

35:27.458 --> 35:30.878
Hey, Jill! Hey.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.380
What?

35:32.463 --> 35:33.214
{\an3}I've tried.

35:33.297 --> 35:36.843
{\an3}But I can't fool myself
any longer.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.386
What are you talking about?

35:38.469 --> 35:39.846
We don't like the same things.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.222
That's not true.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.933
I love what you did to my room.

35:44.016 --> 35:47.436
{\an1}Except the Shaq poster; it's
got to come out of the closet.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.729
And the opera?

35:48.813 --> 35:51.566
And the ballet?
Well... oh...

35:51.649 --> 35:53.901
{\an1}I'm infinitely more culturally
enriched because of you.

35:53.985 --> 35:57.613
{\an3}Please. You're
ambivalent at best.

35:57.697 --> 36:01.242
{\an1}I am not ambivalent.
I'm just not sure, that's all.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.035
Mm-hmm.

36:03.119 --> 36:05.538
{\an1}But you know what?
When you call me Steven...

36:05.621 --> 36:08.958
{\an3}See, don't make this any
harder than it already is.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.337
I will always treasure you.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.637
{\an1}Oh, Jill, you can't break up
with me over this.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.273
Do you believe this?

36:32.356 --> 36:35.401
Well, you didn't want
to be with her anyway.

36:36.694 --> 36:37.945
{\an1}That's not the point.
It's...

36:38.029 --> 36:39.697
Aw, gosh! I'm like...

36:39.780 --> 36:41.949
I'm like "Oh, and a lot."

36:42.033 --> 36:46.787
{\an3}Aw, this is... It's pathetic!
This is really pathetic!

36:46.871 --> 36:49.790
(sighing and groaning)

36:49.874 --> 36:51.459
{\an3}(mumbling)

36:51.542 --> 36:53.419
Y-You know what I think?

36:53.502 --> 36:55.630
No. What?
I think that

36:55.713 --> 36:57.465
under that thick hide of yours,

36:57.548 --> 36:59.634
{\an1}you are a very warm
and compassionate person.

36:59.717 --> 37:00.760
Is that what you think?

37:00.843 --> 37:02.803
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.306
You just need
to find the right woman.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.516
Someone who appreciates you
for who you are.

37:07.600 --> 37:12.605
Someone that you could
be friends with first.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.441
And-and then lovers.

37:17.735 --> 37:20.780
Yes, that's exactly what I need.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.495
Where am I ever going to
find a woman like that?

37:27.578 --> 37:29.330
I don't know.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.874
{\an1}Maybe you're just
not looking hard enough.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.300
(laughing goofily)

37:43.260 --> 37:47.974
I'm sorry about everything.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.433
{\an3}Here.

37:49.517 --> 37:50.685
I didn't ask for them back.

37:50.768 --> 37:53.688
And I can't take them,
not after what I did.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.315
{\an3}Here.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.654
I just want you to know

38:01.737 --> 38:05.032
{\an3}that I never wanted to know
how much they were worth.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.034
They just got appraised
on their own, huh?

38:07.118 --> 38:09.328
No.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.872
I told you,
I had the bracelet appraised

38:11.956 --> 38:14.583
for insurance purposes only.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.043
And the necklace... Valerie,

38:16.127 --> 38:17.753
she took that in
all by herself.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.046
Valerie?

38:19.130 --> 38:20.840
Yeah.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.508
She wanted to stir the pot.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.555
She succeeded.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.393
Why didn't you tell me

38:32.476 --> 38:36.564
that your grandmother gave them
to you when you gave them to me?

38:36.647 --> 38:39.066
I wanted to, but you didn't
want to move in with me,

38:39.150 --> 38:41.068
so I didn't want
to scare you off

38:41.152 --> 38:42.403
by telling you
how much they meant to me.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.364
My grandma gave them to me,
and she said,

38:45.448 --> 38:48.784
"Give these
to someone you truly love."

38:48.868 --> 38:50.244
That's what I did.

38:50.327 --> 38:53.414
And now I've ruined everything.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.007
(sniffles)

39:04.675 --> 39:06.052
Noah...

39:08.512 --> 39:10.681
I need you to believe me.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.810
I didn't care
that they were fake.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.691
I didn't care. I'm sorry.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.613
Hey.

39:29.533 --> 39:30.576
I believe you.

39:30.659 --> 39:32.495
You do?

39:38.375 --> 39:39.460
{\an3}Come here.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.587
(sniffling)

39:46.926 --> 39:51.138
They're more beautiful than
any real diamonds could ever be.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.224
{\an1}Thank you.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.688
{\an5}GREG:
The rink is all yours,
my friend.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.482
I'm even having it
iced down for you.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.317
The Zamboni!

40:05.736 --> 40:07.488
Don't ask me why, but
he loves that machine.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.448
You know, the Zamboni is
possibly the greatest invention

40:09.532 --> 40:10.783
of the 20th century.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.161
{\an1}I've always wanted
to ride on one myself.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.496
That could be arranged

40:15.579 --> 40:18.582
{\an3}for another six months
free advertising.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.336
{\an1}What do you say?
You want to go for a drive?

40:22.419 --> 40:24.380
Yeah.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.382
(upbeat electronic
keyboard music plays)

40:30.594 --> 40:32.054
{\an3}No, no, no.
It's too '70s.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.349
(up-tempo, piano-heavy song
plays)

40:35.432 --> 40:37.351
No, no. It's too pop.

40:37.434 --> 40:40.354
(bright, drum-heavy song plays)

40:40.437 --> 40:43.983
No, no. It's too street.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.402
Do you have anything, uh...
more atmospheric,

40:46.485 --> 40:47.987
{\an3}No, no.
romantic that type of thing?

40:48.070 --> 40:50.364
I...

40:50.447 --> 40:52.199
I didn't realize
this was going to be so hard.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.701
{\an1}What made you think
it was going to be easy?

40:53.784 --> 40:55.369
Okay, you know what?

40:55.452 --> 40:57.204
{\an3}There is one more thing
I've been working on.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.372
Let's hear it.

40:58.455 --> 40:59.582
(tape deck clicks on)

40:59.665 --> 41:02.877
(romantic ballad plays)

41:04.670 --> 41:06.839
Hey, that's not bad.

41:06.922 --> 41:09.675
Okay, now here's the problem.

41:09.758 --> 41:11.343
{\an3}You see...
(tape deck clicks off)

41:11.427 --> 41:13.262
{\an3}I didn't write this song
for the commercial.

41:13.345 --> 41:14.680
{\an3}This is something I wrote
for my girlfriend.

41:14.763 --> 41:17.391
It's kind of personal.
That's why it's good.

41:17.474 --> 41:20.436
{\an1}Listen all we have to do
is speed up the tempo,

41:20.519 --> 41:22.354
add in a little bass line,

41:22.438 --> 41:23.856
{\an1}and I think we might just
have something here.

41:23.939 --> 41:25.941
I don't know.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.026
What is there to know?

41:30.321 --> 41:31.906
{\an3}Nothing.
Nothing at all.

41:31.989 --> 41:32.948
I'm excited.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.201
{\an1}Me, too.
Cool.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.501
{\an3}(laughing)

41:52.968 --> 41:54.595
You know, uh...

41:54.678 --> 41:57.348
a lot of people haven't come
through for Chris, but you have.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.601
{\an1}And I can't tell you
what that means to him.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.312
And me. Thank you.

42:03.395 --> 42:05.356
{\an3}Don't thank me.
Look at my boyfriend.

42:05.439 --> 42:07.566
{\an5}I can't tell who's
having more fun.
(laughing)

42:15.366 --> 42:18.077
(playing fast-tempo version
of romantic ballad)

42:21.413 --> 42:22.289
What's that?

42:22.373 --> 42:24.959
What, you don't recognize it?

42:25.042 --> 42:27.086
No. Should I?

42:31.548 --> 42:32.466
Wait. That's my song.

42:32.549 --> 42:34.134
Not anymore.

42:34.218 --> 42:35.386
Kyle heard it
and wanted to use it,

42:35.469 --> 42:38.931
and now it's the theme to the
Dry &amp; Happy Deodorant Campaign.

42:39.014 --> 42:41.183
You're meaning to tell me
that the song you wrote me

42:41.267 --> 42:42.476
you're using to sell deodorant?

42:42.559 --> 42:44.019
Val, like you said,

42:44.103 --> 42:45.479
I didn't have a choice.
I needed the money.

42:45.562 --> 42:47.648
But don't you know how much
this song means to me?

42:47.731 --> 42:50.150
It means the same to me.

42:52.528 --> 42:53.654
{\an3}I'll write you
another one.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.322
And what? Sell it to...

42:55.406 --> 42:59.493
I don't know a hemorrhoid cream
company or something?

42:59.576 --> 43:00.953
Well, if it pays enough.

43:01.036 --> 43:02.830
{\an1}David.

43:02.913 --> 43:05.916
Promise me that you'll never
sell one of my songs again,

43:06.000 --> 43:07.459
{\an1}no matter how much
they offer you.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.503
What if it's a lot?

43:09.586 --> 43:12.673
David, promise.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.008
Okay, I promise.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.801
Okay.

43:15.884 --> 43:17.636
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

43:19.596 --> 43:21.140
Well, it's official.

43:21.223 --> 43:23.475
The Ice Dome has hired
a new manager

43:23.559 --> 43:25.644
in charge of skate retrieval
and dispensation.

43:25.728 --> 43:27.646
You mean, Chris is going
to be handing out skates

43:27.730 --> 43:29.148
behind the counter?
Mm-hmm.

43:29.231 --> 43:31.191
{\an1}And employees don't have
to pay for ice time.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.360
{\an3}Wow, you sound
a little jealous.

43:33.444 --> 43:35.571
{\an1}Yeah, free ice time,
Zamboni rides.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.364
{\an1}Working with kids.
Could be a lot worse.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.741
Now, maybe with this new job,

43:38.824 --> 43:39.992
he'll get to move
into his apartment

43:40.075 --> 43:41.201
sooner than he thought.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.578
Maybe.

43:46.623 --> 43:47.791
Thank you.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.376
No, I think
I should be thanking you.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.878
I was, uh...

43:50.961 --> 43:53.505
I was really down on
The Beat for a minute there.

43:53.589 --> 43:54.381
And you're better now?

43:54.465 --> 43:56.550
Spending a few days
with Peter Raitt

43:56.634 --> 43:58.385
kind of gave me
a new perspective

43:58.469 --> 43:59.553
on what's really important.

43:59.636 --> 44:02.056
Brandon,
I know you have big dreams.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.391
And I think that's great.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.226
I just want
to be a part of them.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.771
If you could just come up with
a couple of good story ideas...

44:08.854 --> 44:10.606
Ow!

44:10.689 --> 44:13.233
Now that one <i> is</i> going
to leave a mark.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.361
Ow.
