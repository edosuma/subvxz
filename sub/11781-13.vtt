00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.443
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.579
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.580
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.582
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.517
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:16.550 --> 00:19.587
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.322
You're the only one
that can help.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.324
You made all of
your brother's fake IDs.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.226
I want you to
get close to her.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.560
Find out
what she's up to.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.196
So what do you
wanna know about me?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.830
How long have you
been at Whitemarsh?

00:29.863 --> 00:31.599
Long enough to know
that you were in prison.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.234
Ben, we need to talk.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.569
I don't want
to slow things down.

00:35.603 --> 00:39.440
RITA: Then I think we need
to take a little break.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.841
I'm going to
take down Gray and Jane.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.477
And you are going to
help me do it.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.113
And why would I do that?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.215
Because I know
it was you, Jeremy.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.049
You were the mole.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.840
Today's the big day!

01:12.873 --> 01:14.642
It's not that big of a day.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.544
Are you kidding?
It's your birthday.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.413
It's only the most
important day of the year.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.648
If you say so.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.582
(CHUCKLES)

01:23.917 --> 01:25.486
Oh, there she is!

01:26.420 --> 01:27.655
Here I am.

01:27.688 --> 01:28.589
Is that for me?

01:28.622 --> 01:30.158
Who else
would it be for?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.260
Today is your day,

01:32.293 --> 01:34.628
and I wanted to be
the first person to
give you a birthday present.

01:34.662 --> 01:35.829
Oh, thank you.

01:35.863 --> 01:39.533
I was the first person
to wish her
"happy birthday."

01:39.567 --> 01:41.502
Just so
there's no confusion.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.604
Oh, and by the way,
I'm taking Jane out tonight
to celebrate.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.439
Slow your roll, fauxhawk.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.507
Pick another night.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.342
You pick another night,
balloon boy.

01:48.376 --> 01:51.245
Guys, guys.
Stop fighting over me.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.148
You can both
take me out tonight.

that big of a day.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.208

02:20.241 --> 02:21.675
They announced
the playoff schedules
today

02:21.709 --> 02:23.711
and Whitemarsh is
gonna get
a number one seed.

Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
It's for Zoe.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.195
Why'd you
get her a present?

02:41.229 --> 02:43.264
It's more like
an inside joke gift.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.233
You guys already
have inside jokes?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.734
Sorta.
It's no big deal.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.336
We're hanging out again
tonight though.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.637
Mmm-hmm.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.440
And what are you
doing tonight?

02:52.473 --> 02:54.208
I'm celebrating
with the team.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.643
You can tag along
if you want.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.711
It's gonna be kind of
a guy thing though.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.413
And you and Nick
used to date.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.216
I wouldn't want things
to get too awkward for me.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.418
Yeah, I wouldn't
want that.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.354
Yeah, we should probably
get going, huh?

03:11.292 --> 03:13.261
Wow. Janey.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.595
I almost forgot
what day it is.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.231
It's trash day.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.267
You mind grabbing it
on your way out?
Thanks.

I can't believe this.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.681
How's your arm
feeling today?

04:07.715 --> 04:08.749
Fine, I guess.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.451
On a scale of
one to ten.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.552
I have no idea.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.721
Approximately.
Give me a number.

Could we do this
at practice?

Does the name Steve Brooks
ring a bell?

That depends.?

Have you ever
heard of an organization

04:30.804 --> 04:32.806
known as
Major League Baseball?

04:34.808 --> 04:35.709
HaYeah.u?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.811
Good.
Steve's one of
the top scouts.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.514
He used to come here
back in the day
to watch me pitch.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.716
Anyhow, you remember
that one-hit shutout

04:42.750 --> 04:44.818
you threw against
Wrightsville last month?

04:44.852 --> 04:46.053
Yeah.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.322
Well, I sent Steve
the game film.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.357
Is that it?

04:49.823 --> 04:50.591
No.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.426
But he must've
liked what he saw,

04:52.460 --> 04:54.728
because he's here
to watch you pitch today.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.464
Are you Yeah. serious?

04:56.497 --> 04:58.599
This is huge for us.

A scout from the Majors
is here to watch me pitch?
Today?

05:05.373 --> 05:06.574
During lunch.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.742
So, how's that arm feeling?
One to ten.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.612
I need a number.
Right now.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.681
Nine and a half.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.550
So let me get this straight.
It's your best friend
Jane's birthday,

05:16.584 --> 05:17.618
and you know this.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.552
Obviously.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.754
But you don't want her
to know you know.

05:20.788 --> 05:21.889
Exactly.
That's the plan.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.791
Sounds like
a bad plan.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.493
You know, I agree.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.895
Phase one of the plan
is a little questionable.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.630
As long as we're
in agreement.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.632
Look, I've known Jane
my entire life.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.402
She's gonna love it
when we surprise her
tonight at The Rack.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.103
An end of day surprise?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.506
That's phase two
of your brilliant plan?

05:38.539 --> 05:40.574
Actually, it's her
brother Ben's plan.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.875
I can't
take credit for it.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.644
All right.
I get it.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.647
As long as phase three
involves some
pretty great presents.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.384
Actually,
I think there's only
two phases.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.785
But that reminds me.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.622
Can you hide this
in your locker?

05:54.655 --> 05:55.789
It's Jane's present, okay.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.491
She saw it this morning
and I told her
it was for you.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.692
Please don't
drag me into this.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.394
Ooh. There she is.
Take it.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.495

officially met.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.872
This is Zoe.

ThZOE: Hi.e.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.875
I feel like
we've pretty much met.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.678
Every story
that Billy tells me
involves you somehow.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.147
Oh, gosh.
That sounds annoying.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.815
I've heard a lot
about you, too.

06:21.849 --> 06:25.486
I hear you guys have
a funny inside joke.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.888
Yeah.?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.791
No, it's really not really
that funny at all.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.627
Well, I should probably
get to class.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.796
It was nice to
finally meet you, Zoe.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.197
You, too.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.966
You guys
have fun tonight.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.906
Oh, yeah. I might have
accidentally suggested

06:45.939 --> 06:47.841
that we were
hanging out tonight.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.811
Thanks for dragging me
into this.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.025
Come on in.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.598
I gotta ask.
Are you avoiding me?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.766
I thought you
wanted me to avoid you.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.602
No. That's not
what I said.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.971
I just wanted to
slow things down.

07:18.005 --> 07:22.943
I guess I'm not clear
on the definition of
"slow things down."

07:22.976 --> 07:24.678
It just means...

07:24.712 --> 07:26.480
That we're not
together anymore.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.016
Am I wrong?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.484
It's okay.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.753
I got it.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.624
I just kind of wish
we could go back to
the way things were before.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.660
You know, when I could
stop by and hang out
in your office

07:39.693 --> 07:41.261
and it wouldn't
be too weird.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.497
Let's be honest,
it was always
a little weird

07:43.531 --> 07:44.798
when you would
stop in to see me.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.067
But in a good way.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.803
Hey, so...

07:49.837 --> 07:52.740
I don't know if
this would be too weird,

07:52.773 --> 07:55.909
but we're having
a surprise birthday party
for Jane

07:55.943 --> 07:56.977
tonight at The Rack,

07:57.010 --> 08:00.648
and if you wanted
to swing by,
that would be...

08:00.681 --> 08:01.715
That would be cool.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.584
For Jane, you know.
She'd like that.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.553
Sure.
Sounds like fun.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.789
Great.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.059
Oh, yeah,
and if you happen to
run into Jane today,

08:12.092 --> 08:14.695
we're all pretending like
we forgot her birthday.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.067
That sounds like
an awful idea.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.870
No. It's just phase one
of the surprise.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.071
Phase what?

08:24.104 --> 08:26.073
It's not even
remotely funny.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.941
Well, I disagree.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.077
I'm not doing it
to be funny.
Jane needs this.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.745
She's been
working so hard.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.081
And every year
I do something big
for her birthday.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.083
And she kind of
expects it now.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.952
But I want this year to be
the biggest birthday yet.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.088
You know, so, a surprise.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.956
Obviously your intentions
are good here, Ben.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.693
But I just worry that
she has to go through
the whole day

08:45.726 --> 08:47.761
thinking that
everyone has...

08:48.128 --> 08:50.864
Ben, are you okay?

08:50.898 --> 08:51.932
What is it?

08:53.934 --> 08:56.103
It's a birthday card
for Jane.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.871
Who's it from?

08:59.139 --> 09:00.674
It's from our mom.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.349
Good afteIndia. Jeremy.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.984
Isn't it a beautiful day
outside?

09:11.018 --> 09:12.920
That's because you
Iwork too hard..

09:12.953 --> 09:14.187
You should take
more breaks.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.990
Why?
The sooner I finish this,
the sooner you'll go away.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.126
This collaboration is
the only reason you're here.

09:19.159 --> 09:23.030
But we both know
this collaboration is not
the only reason I'm here.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.868
So, what's Gray
been up to?

paying attention.

this morning,
now she's back.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.707
That's all I know.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.875
A meeting with whom?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.945
I have no idea.
Nor do I care.

09:37.978 --> 09:41.014
Oh. Well, then maybe we
should just go talk to Gray.
Get it over with.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.884
Your career has to
end someday, right?
Why not today.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.119
I'll let you tell her
the part
about you and Beau.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.888
Shh!

09:47.921 --> 09:50.991
I have no access
to Gray's calendar,
India.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.126
Sounds like
you have a task!

09:53.160 --> 09:54.995
HeThanks.go.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.165
And how would you suggest
I gain access
to her calendar?

09:58.198 --> 10:00.167
Well, first you'll need
the password
to her computer.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.136
Two options there.
You can either
get it from Gray,

10:03.170 --> 10:05.138
or the only other person
who Jane. it.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.040
I don't want to do this.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.642
That's why it's fun.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.077
Get to work.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.653
Hey, Coach.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.189
Any last minute advice?

10:23.824 --> 10:24.958
Advice? A pep talk?

10:25.759 --> 10:26.894
Anything.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.762
Sorry.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.897
You've been
through this before.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.231
What did your coach
say to you?

10:32.833 --> 10:36.436
He walked up to me.
He handed me the ball.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.073
And he said,
"Don't blow it, Quimby."

10:40.107 --> 10:42.109
(CHUCKLES)
Not exactly a pep talk.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.046
Maybe not.
But he knew how important
the moment was.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.948
Look, the scout's not here
to watch you do anything

10:47.981 --> 10:49.917
that you don't
do every day
in practice.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.054
Most people never get
an opportunity like this.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.690
So don't blow it, Fadden.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.289
Whoo!

11:32.059 --> 11:34.027
All right.
I think I've seen enough.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.063
Nice job, Nick.
You've got some heat.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.831
Thanks.

11:37.865 --> 11:38.899
(GRUNTS)

11:43.871 --> 11:46.273
Wow.
These look amazing.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.776
I'm busy, Jane.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.878
Okay.
Sorry to bother you.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.747
No, wait,
I'm sorry.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.816
I'm just a bit
overwhelmed is all.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.285
It's okay.
I understand.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.488
You are taking on
a lot of responsibility.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.123
And you're doing
a great job.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.825
In case nobody's
told you that lately.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.860
Thank you.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.128
Don't let it
go to your head.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.197
I'll try not to.
(CHUCKLES)

12:10.230 --> 12:14.067
It's time for me to
go assist the boss.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.204
It must be difficult
keeping track of all of
Gray's appointments.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.172
Oh, it's not that bad.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.108
I mean, her calendar
definitely keeps me busy,

12:21.141 --> 12:22.242
but it's part of the job.
Right?

12:22.275 --> 12:24.077
Yeah, yeah.
Would you like some help?

12:24.111 --> 12:25.312
With what?
Gray's schedule?

12:25.345 --> 12:27.080
Yeah. I'm happy to
lend a hand.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.549
Jeremy, you are overseeing
the most important collection

12:29.582 --> 12:32.152
that Donovan Decker
has had in years.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.154
I'm pretty sure your
energy and focus
should be on that.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.790
(LAUGHS)
I suppose you're right.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.358
But it was very nice
of you to offer.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.530
What is Birdie
doing down here?

12:43.563 --> 12:45.198
I haven't seen her
for weeks.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.100
Must mean
someone's getting hired.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.769
Or getting fired.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.574
STEVE: Hey, you were right.
Kid's got good stuff.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.077
Kinda reminds me of you
when you pitched
on this mound.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.345
That was
a long time ago.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.947
Not that long.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.214
You got anything left
in the tank?

13:01.248 --> 13:02.549
Not that I know of.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.984
Well, let's find out.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.953
I left all that behind.
Remember?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.021
I do.
And I remember why
you did it.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.857
There's no use
hanging on to the past.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.558
Sure Why?e is.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.260
Because it was your dream.
And you loved it.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.128
Come on.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.365
One pitch.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.034
One pitch.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.377
ComAll right.h.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.945
Fire iYeah. hole.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.155
Ben, where did that
come from?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.227
One pitch.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.997
Have I told you
how much I love
your new office, Gray?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.131
Yes, you have.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.267
Right. Forgot.
It's great.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.036
Thank you.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.871
Oh, and I wanted to
thank you for going
a full two weeks

13:57.905 --> 13:59.072
without a single
termination.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.140
It's a new record.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.175
Since you took over.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.945
Although it has
made my job a little
boring lately.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.646
I'll see what I can
do about that.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.883
Oh, don't go firing anyone
just to keep me busy.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.052
Unless you really want to.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.321
Kidding.
Or not. Up to you.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.189
Ha!

14:16.223 --> 14:17.190
So are we finished here?

14:17.224 --> 14:19.960
No, that was just
small talk.

14:19.993 --> 14:23.196
Which I promise to
avoid in the future.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.232
Anyway,
I was updating
our employee files,

14:25.265 --> 14:27.200
and I came across
a piece of information

14:27.234 --> 14:28.201
I think
you should see.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.441
This is Jane's file.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.209
Yes. I circled
a discrepancy.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.315
Are you sure
this is correct?

14:42.349 --> 14:44.151
As far as I know. Yes.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.254
That little liar.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.429
Can I help you, Jane?

14:56.463 --> 15:00.033
Uh, is that my...?

15:01.301 --> 15:03.070
Oh. Uh...

15:03.103 --> 15:05.405
Is everything okay?
I saw Birdie come in here

15:05.438 --> 15:07.207
and it looked
sort of serious.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.309
And it's probably
none of my business.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.944
Correct.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.679
Right.

15:12.712 --> 15:16.149
So you said
you had some things that
you needed me to do today.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.717
I changed my mind.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.953
You changed
your mind about...?

15:19.987 --> 15:21.188
I don't need you.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.490
But who's gonna
answer your phones?

15:23.523 --> 15:24.491
I'll do it myself.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.128
That'll be all.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.948
Move!

15:49.149 --> 15:50.150
Sorry.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.056
Hello, Jeremy.
Checking in.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.157
What've you
got for me?

15:57.190 --> 16:00.027
India, I really do have
a lot of actual work to do.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.195
Oh, you mean the work
that I was hired to
critique and approve?

16:02.229 --> 16:03.730
Let's see.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.132
Don't care.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.299
Really don't care.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.968
This one's okay.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.304
Still don't care.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.739
Thanks for
the morale boost.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.408
I'm assuming that
you didn't get the password
to Gray's computer.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.144
Try harder.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.146
Passwords are secret
for a reason, India.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.182
It's not as if I can just
request it in a casual
conversation with Jane.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.516
Oh! You're terrible
at this.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.551
I'll take that
as a compliment.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.553
The clock is
ticking, Jeremy.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.421
IYes.?

16:28.455 --> 16:31.024
Obviously it's ticking.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.559
Since when?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.761
Since the moment
I told you I needed
Gray's calendar.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.430
In my defense,
this is the first I'm hearing
about an actual deadline.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.565
Do you think
this is funny?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.368
No.

16:41.401 --> 16:44.371
Maybe I wasn't clear before.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.475
You, Jeremy,
need to do what I tell you,
when I tell you,

16:48.508 --> 16:51.578
or I will see to it that
your entire life is ruined.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.047
How's that
for an actual deadline?

17:00.153 --> 17:01.488
Mind if I join you?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.056
Go for it.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.226
So how are you today?

17:06.259 --> 17:07.460
You know
when you get the feeling

17:07.494 --> 17:10.263
that something bad is
about to happen to you?

17:10.297 --> 17:11.798
Is something bad
about to happen to me?

17:11.831 --> 17:13.500
No. Not you.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.335
Forget it.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.204
I know this
might sound paranoid.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.173
But something's up.
I think I'm about to
get fired.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.143
Why would you get fired?

17:23.176 --> 17:26.846
Because I haven't been
completely honest here.

17:26.879 --> 17:31.118
I feel like a fraud,
and I'm just waiting for
everybody to figure it out.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.187
Well, we all feel
like that sometimes.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.089
You have no idea.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.491
And to top it all off,
it is my birthday.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.593
That's a good thing.
Right?

17:40.627 --> 17:42.529
Not when everyone
forgot about it.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.864
Ouch. Really?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.100
Oh, no.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.369
Well, I got an idea.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.406
I got to run some errands.
And I was thinking that
you could come with me.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.641
I can't just leave.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.908
I already cleared it
with Gray.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.845
I really don't think
it's a good idea to be
running errands.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.647
Because my career
is imploding.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.415
Yeah.
Well, if that's true,

18:02.449 --> 18:05.652
then it's probably better
to be outside
of the blast radius.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.521
I said imploding,
not exploding.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.257
But you make
a decent point.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.392
So let me just go
get my phone.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.262
No, you don't need your phone.
You need to clear your head.
All right?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.696
Come on.
We'll be back before
you know it.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.268
(BELL RINGING)

18:21.301 --> 18:22.302
Hey, Ben.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.637
Hi.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.873
I heard Nick Fadden
really put on a show
for that scout today.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.308
He did.
I'm proud of him.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.679
So if you don't
mind me asking,

18:32.712 --> 18:35.648
how did Jane react to
getting a card from
your mom?

18:35.682 --> 18:37.684
I decided not to
give it to her.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.887
Ben, don't you think
you're taking this
birthday surprise too far?

18:40.920 --> 18:42.555
It's not about that.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.724
She, um...
She can't...

18:46.326 --> 18:48.661
She can't just send a card
after all these years.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.397
She doesn't get
to do that.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.731
It's too late.
She's just...

18:52.965 --> 18:54.201
She's too late.

18:57.204 --> 19:00.207
Do you really think that
you should get to decide
that for Jane?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.909
Actually, yes.
I do get to decide
that for her.

19:02.942 --> 19:06.713
It's my decision
because our mom
gave me that power

19:06.746 --> 19:10.350
when she abandoned us.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.186
And I'd appreciate it
if you'd support
that decision.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.460
Password, password,
password.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.495
If I were Gray's password,
where would I be?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.631
Not in here.
Not under here.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.366
No, not in here.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.302
Can I help you, Jeremy?

19:29.336 --> 19:32.739
Oh, hello, Gray.
I was just looking for you.
Actually.

19:32.772 --> 19:33.906
Under my desk?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.343
No. While I was
waiting for you,
I was just admiring it.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.645
It's quite elegant.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.614
Solid construction.
Sleek design.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.949
Who makes this?

19:42.982 --> 19:44.984
WNot me.s?

19:45.017 --> 19:45.952
I'm glad you're here.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.554
YoYes.e?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.658
What'veI'm sorry?or me?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.393
I'm talking about India.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.362
I gave you
a specific assignment.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.764
Get close to India.
Very close.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.433
Find out what
she's up to.
Remember?

20:00.467 --> 20:02.001
Yes. Yes.
Of course I remember.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.004
Well, have you
had success?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.673
Define success.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.809
Useful information.
Do you have any?

20:12.612 --> 20:13.680
(MOUTHING)

20:15.282 --> 20:16.516
Not yet.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.352
Oh. Then get to work.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.026
Admit it.
That's the best thing
you've ever eaten. Right?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.561
No. Not even close.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.263
You know the secret?
It's the stick.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.798
It apparently
gives the meat
its delicious flavor.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.065
I don't think so.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.602
I don't know.
I've actually never had
one of those things.

20:35.635 --> 20:36.769
What?

20:36.803 --> 20:38.805
It's meat on a stick.
It's disgusting.
Who eats that?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.807
I mean,
frankly I'm a little
disappointed in you.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.141
You're a little bit annoying.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.445
Oh, just trust me.
I can be so annoying
if you give me a chance.

20:45.812 --> 20:46.813
I might.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.281
So where are we
going next?

20:48.315 --> 20:49.582
Let's go ice skating
at Rockefeller Center.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.784
It's not exactly
ice skating weather.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.686
You're right.
It feels a little warm,
doesn't it?

20:53.720 --> 20:54.854
Okay.
Come here.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.293
Looks good.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.494
(LAUGHS)

21:01.528 --> 21:02.595
No. No.

21:04.864 --> 21:05.865
(LAUGHING)

21:06.833 --> 21:08.401
Hey!

21:08.435 --> 21:10.303
How's it going?

21:10.337 --> 21:12.472
Jane. Chris Benz.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.906
Jane.
Nice to meet you.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.644
Nice to meet you.
I know who you are.
You're the prince of color.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.046
Well, good to see you.
I got to run.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.614
Very nice to meet you.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.620
Does it look like me?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.656
Don't talk.
You're gonna ruin it.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.424
But yeah,
it looks exactly like you.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.104
Phase two.
The big surprise.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.474
You got it.
What do you think?

21:47.507 --> 21:50.510
I like it.
It's clean.
Simple.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.812
I'm not really sure it's clear
whose birthday it is though.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.514
(LAUGHS)
Too much?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.683
It's really uneven.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.919
Okay. In that case,
grab the other end.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.827
Just a little lower.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.829
Yeah. Right there.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.631
Much better.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.132
Thank you.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.701
Here's your decoy gift.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.905
Yeah. I'm sorry I
put you in that position
with Jane.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.573
It wasn't cool.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.909
I mean, you guys just met
and everything.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.110
It's all right.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.946
The decoy date part
was a little much.
But I'm over it.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.850
Good So,know.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.519
do you think
she's gonna like
all this?

22:33.620 --> 22:34.787
(SIGHS)

22:35.622 --> 22:36.823
I hope so.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.759
To be honest,
I really just wanna
get this over with.

22:39.792 --> 22:43.930
Things have been
different since I
got back to school.

22:43.963 --> 22:47.734
Jane and I were just
finally starting to
get back on track.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.168
You two are
pretty close, huh?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.703
Yeah.
About as close as
you can be.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.807
Were you two ever...
you know?

22:54.841 --> 22:58.445
No. No.
We're just best friends.

22:58.845 --> 22:59.846
Oh.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.850
Just wondering.

23:03.883 --> 23:07.654
Hey, do you think that
you can give me a ride home
tonight after the party?

23:07.687 --> 23:08.688
If not it's totally cool.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.690
No. It's cool.
I'd like that.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.459
Me, too.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.697
(LAUGHING)
This looks
nothing like me.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.499
Well then,
you shouldn't have
been talking.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.968
You think me talking
made my chin
three times too big?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.970
We're never gonna know,
are we?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.505
Thank you for this.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.774
You're welcome.

23:27.807 --> 23:31.978
So nobody remembered
your birthday, huh?

23:32.011 --> 23:35.181
It's okay.
I think everybody's
just really busy.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.849
There's a lot going on.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.652
My brother's going
through a breakup,

23:39.686 --> 23:41.988
and my best friend
just met a girl.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.791
Is this the same best friend
you rushed off to meet
the other night?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.626
Yes. That is the one.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.495
Sounds like he's
more than a friend.

23:48.528 --> 23:49.962
No.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.465
I mean,
he'll always be
more than a friend.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.200
But sometimes
the timing
just isn't right.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.502
Close your eyes.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.603
I'd rather not.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.437
Just do it.

23:59.706 --> 24:00.807
Hey, man.
Let me get this balloon.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.874
Yeah.

24:01.908 --> 24:02.909
Here you go.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.879
Okay. Open 'em.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.715
(LAUGHS)
What's this?

24:08.748 --> 24:10.850
It's a balloon on a string.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.853
It's the best I could do
on short notice.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.221
Thank you, Eli.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.789
Happy birthday, Jane.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.669
Where is everyone?

24:30.903 --> 24:32.672
I don't know.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.073
Maybe everyone
went home for the day.

24:35.675 --> 24:36.743
ALL: Surprise!

24:37.810 --> 24:40.079
I guess not everyone
forgot about your birthday.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.484
Thank you.

24:53.826 --> 24:54.861
Happy birthday.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.262
Thank you, guys.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.664
Oh, you should've
seen your face.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.965
Priceless.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.733
You seriously
had no idea?

25:00.767 --> 25:02.068
BNo idea..

25:02.101 --> 25:04.971
And if I'm being honest,
I thought I was being fired.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.839
Why would you be fired?

25:06.873 --> 25:08.908
I don't know.
I guess I was
being a little...

25:08.941 --> 25:10.076
Paranoid?

25:10.109 --> 25:12.812
Yes. I was being paranoid.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.681
Well, Eli was
a rock star today.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.649
Oh, he was?

25:16.683 --> 25:19.919
Carter texted him
like eight times to keep
you away from the office.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.654
It wasn't easy.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.824
We actually ended up getting
one of those little caricature
things just to kill time.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.559
Well, good work, Eli.

25:28.795 --> 25:32.699
So you were
just stalling
this whole time?

25:32.732 --> 25:35.868
Yeah. You know,
it's not easy to plan
a whole fake date on the fly.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.572
Well, you made it
look easy.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.073
Thanks.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.609
WOMAN: Happy birthday.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.610
Thank you.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.047
Dude, where is Jane?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.649
She's on her way.

25:49.682 --> 25:50.817
She said that?

25:50.850 --> 25:52.318
Not in those exact words.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.620
Okay.
You can't get
a hold of her.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.321
I can get
a hold of her easily.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.123
I just haven't yet.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.626
I texted her.
I'm waiting to hear back.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.760
How many texts?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.863
SWow!.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.866
Phase two of the plan
is officially unraveling.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.635
There's no need to panic.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.871
Who are all these people?

26:11.904 --> 26:14.741
I don't know.
Jane's friends?

26:14.774 --> 26:16.776
Harper invited
most of them.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.611
Who invited Harper?

26:19.912 --> 26:20.980
I did.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.682
I wanted to fill the room.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.617
Okay, everyone!

26:24.651 --> 26:27.386
Everyone,
when I say hide,

26:27.419 --> 26:28.788
everyone should hide.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.024
And then when Jane
comes in the door,
yell "surprise" really loud.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.626
NICK: Thanks, Harper.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.895
But I think we've all been
to a surprise party before.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.098
No, I saw a few nerds here.
I'm just trying to
keep them in the loop.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.166
Very thoughtful of you.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.635
Thanks.
I thought so, too.

26:42.669 --> 26:43.836
Okay.
Any questions?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.773
Yes, Caitlyn.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.175
Whose birthday party
is this?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.643
It's Jane's.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.780
Yes, Caitlyn, again.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.682
Who's Jane?

26:55.715 --> 26:58.617
It doesn't matter!
It's a party. Don't make
me regret inviting you.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.854
This is it!

27:01.888 --> 27:03.422
She's here!
Everyone hide.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.025
And don't forget to
yell out "surprise"
when she comes in.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.165
ALL: Surprise!

27:17.169 --> 27:18.938
It's not her!

27:18.971 --> 27:21.640
Everyone.
That is not Jane.
It's Lulu.

27:24.744 --> 27:27.146
Hey. What are you
doing here?

27:27.179 --> 27:28.948
Harper invited me.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.416
But you don't even
like Jane.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.219
True, but I had a feeling
you'd sneak away to her party.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.687
Looks like I was right.

27:34.721 --> 27:35.922
I didn't sneak
away to anything.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.023
You didn't tell me
you were coming.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.125
That's because I
found out about it
after school.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.693
Coach Quimby invited me.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.228
Why can't you just admit
you didn't want me here?

27:42.261 --> 27:43.863
I don't really care if...

27:44.463 --> 27:45.497
You know what?

27:45.531 --> 27:47.834
Maybe we should just leave
before Jane gets here.

27:47.867 --> 27:48.968
I don't wanna
ruin her party.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.072
No. You can leave
if you want.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.273
I think I'm gonna
stay for a while.

27:54.941 --> 27:55.975
Okay.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.849
What the hell
is going on here?

28:02.882 --> 28:04.483
Birthday party for Jane.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.719
Are you kidding me?

28:06.753 --> 28:09.488
Oh, no.
She's gonna think I got
all dressed up for her.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.257
What's the matter, India?

28:11.290 --> 28:14.727
Gray never threw you a party
when you were her assistant?

28:14.761 --> 28:15.928
(SCOFFS)
Didn't think so.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.035
Feeling like
an outsider yet?

28:23.069 --> 28:26.205
You should be.
You are an outsider now.

28:26.238 --> 28:29.008
Gray's nephew is
the new teacher's pet.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.476
So whether you
like it or not,

28:30.509 --> 28:32.779
you and I are
in this together, Jeremy.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.115
I need another drink.

28:39.318 --> 28:40.319
Oh!

28:51.063 --> 28:52.932
Hey, did I miss
the big surprise?

28:52.965 --> 28:54.934
No. Jane's not here yet.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.302
Yeah..

28:56.335 --> 28:58.838
Things are not going
as smoothly as I'd hoped.

28:58.871 --> 28:59.939
Shocker.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.810
I guess I deserve that.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.511
I wasn't sure you
were gonna show up.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.146
I told you I was coming.

29:07.179 --> 29:10.516
Yeah, but I was
kind of a jerk
to you earlier.

29:10.549 --> 29:11.851
I'm sorry.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.553
I think I kind of
have a short fuse when
it comes to my mom.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.554
It's okay.
I understand.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.124
It was really
none of my business
anyway.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.092
Well, I'm glad you're here.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.194
Me, too.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.963
I miss you.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.365
Everybody hide!
This time it's really her!

29:27.900 --> 29:29.068
Good timing.

29:30.970 --> 29:31.971
ALL: Surprise!

29:32.371 --> 29:33.372
Oh.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.044
Everyone.
Another false alarm!

29:38.077 --> 29:39.846
This is not Jane.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.080
I have no idea who
these women are,

29:41.113 --> 29:42.982
or what they are
doing here.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.818
Wait a minute.
Is that...

29:45.852 --> 29:46.886
Amanda Clark.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.855
Wow!

29:51.390 --> 29:52.825
Ben!

29:57.163 --> 29:58.230
Who's the babe?

29:58.264 --> 30:00.299
She was our prom queen.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.869
Every girl wanted to be her,
and every boy was in love
with her.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.037
Including Ben?

30:06.005 --> 30:07.073
Looks like it.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.981
So, Jeremy,
did you know
about this?

30:15.915 --> 30:16.849
What?

30:16.883 --> 30:18.250
About the surprise party.

30:18.284 --> 30:21.053
I found out
moments before
you came back.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.354
Happy birthday, Jane.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.090
Thanks.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.291
How was
your afternoon
with Gray's niece?

30:25.324 --> 30:28.194
(LAUGHS) Nephew.
And you can call him Eli.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.629
No, thanks.
He got the job because
he's Gray's nephew,

30:30.662 --> 30:32.231
so I'll call him
Gray's nephew.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.900
Maybe you should
give him a chance.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.402
I don't have to
give him a chance!

30:36.435 --> 30:38.304
Jeremy.
I think you've had
enough to drink.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.638
So do I.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.641
What does it matter, India?
You gonna
blackmail me some more?

30:42.674 --> 30:44.877
What is he
talking about?

30:44.911 --> 30:46.178
Nothing. He's drunk.
Jeremy, come on,
come with me.

30:46.212 --> 30:47.646
Where we going?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.181
Don't you want to
get the password?

30:50.950 --> 30:51.984
You need to
pull it together.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.419
I'm tired of
your threats.

30:53.452 --> 30:54.887
Oh, you think I'm bluffing?

30:54.921 --> 30:55.922
'Cause I will go
tell Gray the truth.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.156
Do it.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.025
What?

30:59.058 --> 31:01.928
Go get Gray.
Let's get this over with.
I'm ready to confess.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.096
Go get her, India.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.933
Go get Gray.

31:06.966 --> 31:10.002
Okay. Fine. Fine.
I'll go get her.

31:10.036 --> 31:13.305
But before I do,
there's something I
need to tell you.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.941
Over here.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.109
What is over here?

31:20.479 --> 31:22.014
Let me out of here.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.282
(BANIt's dark.OR)

31:23.315 --> 31:25.952
Not until you sober up
and snap out of it.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.221
(GIRL LAUGHING)

31:32.959 --> 31:35.928
So is that like
Billy's new girlfriend?

31:35.962 --> 31:38.497
I have no idea.
Who cares?

31:39.298 --> 31:41.067
I don't care.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.969
Then why bring it up?

31:43.002 --> 31:45.137
I was just wondering
who Billy's next victim is.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.340
Now you know.

31:48.374 --> 31:51.077
You know,
I'm still waiting on you to
ask me how today went.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.611
How what went?

31:52.644 --> 31:57.049
I told you that a major league
scout was coming to
watch me pitch today.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.485
Right...
Wait. What?

31:59.518 --> 32:01.320
Maybe if you stopped
looking over at Billy

32:01.353 --> 32:03.289
you'd be able to
follow along.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.991
What do you
want me to say?

32:05.024 --> 32:06.192
Nothing.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.460
This conversation's over.
And so are we.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.429
Fine by me.

32:19.305 --> 32:22.241
Hi. Just so you know,
whoever you are.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.111
This little thing
here with Billy,
it isn't gonna work out.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.312
Sorry to disappoint you.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.379
Lulu, stop.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.381
No matter what he
says to you,

32:29.415 --> 32:33.019
you should know
he's in love with
his best friend.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.420
And that's
never gonna change.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.157
Good luck.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.435
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

32:53.472 --> 32:57.543
Jane. It's me again.
Please call me back.
It's important.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.312
Hello, Ben.
Is everything okay?

33:00.346 --> 33:02.281
Yeah, yeah.
Nothing to worry about.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.783
So what's
going on here?

33:04.816 --> 33:08.520
Amanda was just telling me
about her career in Hollywood.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.522
I always knew you were
gonna make it big.

33:10.556 --> 33:15.294
Well, I just filmed
an episode of CSI.
Not to brag.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.363
That's huge.
I love that show.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.299
I actually saw that episode.
Didn't you play a corpse?

33:20.332 --> 33:25.437
Yes.
And not just any corpse.
An opening scene corpse.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.306
That's so cool.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.409
It's gotta be really hard
to stay still for that long.

33:30.442 --> 33:31.410
Yeah, it is.

33:31.443 --> 33:34.146
And they don't teach that
in acting school,

33:34.180 --> 33:36.582
so I had to really rely
on my natural instincts.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.484
You must be
really talented.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.353
Thank you, Ben.
You're so sweet.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.324
So what are you
doing here, Amanda?

33:45.357 --> 33:46.892
Well, I just moved
back to town,

33:46.925 --> 33:51.563
and I remembered that
this place literally has
the best wings on the planet.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.132
RITA: Literally?

33:53.165 --> 33:55.567
So you've tried every
single wing on the planet?

33:55.601 --> 33:57.203
They are delicious.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.537
They're so delicious.

33:58.570 --> 34:02.108
I love this place.
Everybody used to come
here in high school.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.343
Not everybody.
I didn't.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.346
Oh, no, no.
I meant everyone that went
to our high school.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.382
Yes.
Our high school.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.484
Wait. What?
You went to school
with us?

34:12.518 --> 34:14.453
Yes, Amanda.
We've been sitting here

34:14.486 --> 34:17.356
reminiscing
about high school
for almost an hour.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.460
Oh. Okay. I thought
you were just chiming in.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.195
I honestly thought
it was really weird.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.631
Wait. Who were you?

34:25.664 --> 34:29.135
I was and still am
Rita Shaw.

34:29.168 --> 34:32.638
Rita Shaw.
Rita Shaw.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.406
(MUTTERS)
No, please. No, please.
No, please.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.842
Oh, wait a minute.

34:36.875 --> 34:40.279
Head gear?
Oh. My. God.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.580
(LAUGHS)

34:41.613 --> 34:44.316
Shaw the Jaw!

34:44.350 --> 34:47.386
You know what?
I'm gonna go get Jane and
bring her back here.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.554
Jaw, how are you?

34:50.422 --> 34:52.158
Oh!
No, is see it now.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.428
Boom!
Paying attention?

34:58.464 --> 34:59.465
Is everything okay?

34:59.498 --> 35:01.267
Yeah.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.503
Look, I'm sorry about that
whole Lulu thing.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.405
I thought you said
you and Jane
were just friends.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.307
We arOh, yeah?iends.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.176
Your ex-girlfriend
seems to disagree.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.578
Yeah.
That's why there's an ex
in front of girlfriend.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.480
What's her deal anyway?

35:14.513 --> 35:16.515
Lulu?
She's just a rich girl.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.550
People like that,
they're not like us.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.686
I knew we came from
two different worlds.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.521
I won't make
that mistake again.

35:25.457 --> 35:30.229
Hey, guys.
I just wanted to apologize
about Lulu's meltdown earlier.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.563
I hope it didn't
ruin your night.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.267
I'll see you around.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.503
Wait. Hey, Fadden.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.271
Wanna play a game of pool
before you leave?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.474
Yeah. Rack 'em.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.479
Make a wish.

35:47.513 --> 35:48.480
Okay.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.584
GRAY: Before you blow out
your candles, Jane,

35:52.618 --> 35:54.253
can I ask you
a question?

35:54.286 --> 35:55.554
Of course.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.623
How many candles
should be on your cake?

35:58.524 --> 36:00.626
Oh. Um, 23?

36:02.261 --> 36:04.696
We know you're
lying about your age, Jane.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.700
You do?

36:08.734 --> 36:13.505
I saw your driver's license
with your real age
in your file.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.641
You're not 23.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.479
You're 25.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.581
And far too young to be
shaving off years.

36:23.649 --> 36:24.550
Caught me.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.721
Dude, I remember
you being better at this.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.623
You trying to
hustle me again?

36:31.657 --> 36:35.527
I wish.
I think I did something
to my arm today.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.330
Oh, yeah.
You had that scout come
watch you pitch, right?

36:38.364 --> 36:40.266
It was going great,

36:40.299 --> 36:42.634
and then there was
a pop in my shoulder.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.504
What kind of pop?

36:45.537 --> 36:47.306
The kind
your shoulder's not
supposed to make.

36:47.339 --> 36:49.308
I'm sure it's fine, man.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.511
Yeah.
I hope you're right.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.381
HapThank you.y.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.484
Hey.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.619
Still the worst day ever?

37:00.652 --> 37:04.556
Far from it.
And I guess I owe
a lot of that to you.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.592
I had fun
hanging out today.

37:06.625 --> 37:10.629
And I was wondering
if we could
do it again sometime.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.731
I mean, if you want.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.634
I'm still down to go
ice skating when it
gets a little colder.

37:15.667 --> 37:20.539
Just to be clear.
Are you asking me
on another fake date?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.308
You think I...

37:22.708 --> 37:24.543
Come here.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.678
You don't have to
explain anything.

37:26.712 --> 37:27.679
Yes, I do.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.484
Jane.

37:32.518 --> 37:37.356
I'll admit that today
started out as fake
or whatever.

37:37.389 --> 37:40.559
But you should know
that I volunteered.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.295
I wanted to go.

37:43.329 --> 37:46.332
And I had fun
hanging out.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.700
I didn't want it to end.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.602
And...

37:51.337 --> 37:53.038
I wanna do it again.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.440
Was that fake?

37:54.473 --> 37:55.474
No.

37:56.342 --> 37:57.609
That was very real.

38:03.682 --> 38:04.650
Think about it.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.091
(BANGING ON DOOR)

38:13.124 --> 38:14.726
JEREMY:
If you two are done,
can you let me out of here?

38:14.760 --> 38:15.761
Jeremy?

38:18.697 --> 38:21.367
What are you
doing in here.
Are you okay?

38:21.400 --> 38:24.102
No, Jane.
I'm not okay.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.637
Talk to me.
Tell me what's wrong.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.639
I don't know how to
tell you this.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.343
It was me all along.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.444
What are you
talking about?

38:32.478 --> 38:33.779
It wasn't India.
It was me.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.748
I gave our
secrets to Beau.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.721
Look, I'm so, so...

38:55.734 --> 38:58.470
Looks like this night
was a huge success.

38:58.504 --> 38:59.838
Yeah, thank you.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.374
Oh, I'm not
talking about for you.

39:02.408 --> 39:04.776
I finally realize
this night was never
about you.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.745
What are you
talking about, India?

39:06.778 --> 39:09.581
Tonight was all about Gray.
As usual.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.450
You see that guy
over there.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.685
He's a reporter
writing a puff piece
on Gray.

39:13.719 --> 39:16.755
And this party
she's throwing
her lowly assistant is

39:16.788 --> 39:18.657
gonna make her look like
the boss of the year.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.593
Mmm.
You know Gray.
All about the spin.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.962
Oh, and lying
about your age,

39:24.830 --> 39:25.931
a little pathetic.

39:34.806 --> 39:37.543
Can I tell you a secret?

39:37.576 --> 39:39.578
I don't know if we're
ready for secrets.

39:39.611 --> 39:43.682
I had the biggest crush
on Ben Quimby

39:43.715 --> 39:45.617
when we were in high school.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.419
Oh. That's good to know.

39:47.453 --> 39:48.787
What about you?

39:48.820 --> 39:49.955
What about me?

39:49.988 --> 39:51.557
Who did you have
a crush on?

39:51.590 --> 39:53.191
You know,
I can't remember.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.960
Don't you think
Ben is even cuter now

39:54.993 --> 39:56.828
than he was
when we were
in high school?

39:56.862 --> 39:58.664
I haven't
thought about it.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.532
Do you know if he
has a girlfriend?

40:00.566 --> 40:01.867
Actually, I...

40:05.236 --> 40:07.706
He doesn't have
a girlfriend.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.742
Huh. Lucky me. Hmm?

40:12.744 --> 40:15.447
* Just give 'em
your Sunday smile

40:15.981 --> 40:18.750
* And keep a move on

40:20.886 --> 40:24.690
* Even in the dead of night

40:24.723 --> 40:28.727
* Their words are
ringing in your mind

40:28.760 --> 40:32.731
* Just give 'em
your Sunday smile

40:32.764 --> 40:34.900
* And keep a move on

40:38.269 --> 40:42.741
* You better not look down
You better not look down
You'll see your shadow *

40:42.774 --> 40:44.643
You forgot my birthday.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.778
No, Jane.
I didn't forget.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.849
But I did make
a terrible mistake.

40:50.882 --> 40:54.486
I wanted to surprise you,
and it backfired.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.654
Hugely.

40:56.254 --> 40:57.789
I'm really sorry.

40:57.823 --> 40:58.757
I hate surprises.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.025
You love surprises.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.993
You love surprises.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.028
Oh.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.865
Not anymore.

41:08.567 --> 41:11.703
For what it's worth,
there is a party,

41:11.737 --> 41:15.507
albeit much sadder
and not nearly as nice,
at The Rack.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.242
Really?

41:17.275 --> 41:19.678
There are people there
who love you

41:19.711 --> 41:21.780
and some who
may or may not
be your friends

41:21.813 --> 41:24.249
who would love to wish you
a happy birthday.

41:24.282 --> 41:25.751
Before it's too late.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.087
I think I'm ready to go.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.592
Before we go,

41:35.093 --> 41:37.963
there's something
I should've given you
this morning.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.799
Aww, Ben.
You got me a card?

41:40.832 --> 41:41.933
It's not from me.

41:44.736 --> 41:45.871
It's from Mom.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.713
You're not gonna open it?

41:55.981 --> 41:57.983
Today has been
hard enough.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.890
Let's get
some All right.ngs.

42:10.696 --> 42:11.797
Is this it?

42:11.830 --> 42:13.865
Yeah.
Right here is good.

42:16.034 --> 42:19.104
Oh, look.
I'm sorry again
about Lulu.

42:19.137 --> 42:21.640
No. No, it's not okay.

42:21.673 --> 42:22.741
You didn't deserve that.

42:22.774 --> 42:26.712
People like us
shouldn't date
people like them.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.980
I learned my lesson
the hard way.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.148
I'll remember that.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.018
Anyway,
thanks for the ride.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.986
Wait, I'll walk you
to your door.

42:35.020 --> 42:37.656
It's okay.
My dad's inside
waiting for me.

42:37.689 --> 42:38.857
OBye.

42:43.995 --> 42:45.163
(ENGINE STARTS)

42:58.677 --> 43:02.180
* Something's gotta give

43:05.116 --> 43:06.952
* Oh

43:09.087 --> 43:11.957
* Something's gotta give

43:11.990 --> 43:14.826
* Something's gotta give

43:14.860 --> 43:17.996
* Something's gotta give

43:20.065 --> 43:22.200
* Something's gotta give

43:22.934 --> 43:23.935
Oh, man.

43:25.804 --> 43:27.939
I can't believe I
ruined your birthday.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.375
I feel terrible.

43:30.408 --> 43:31.977
It's okay, Ben.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.612
WOMAN:
Happy birthday, Jane.

43:37.082 --> 43:38.049
Mom?
