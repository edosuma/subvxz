00:22.190 --> 00:23.358
Hello?

00:27.320 --> 00:28.530
Nancy?

00:31.324 --> 00:32.617
Nancy!

00:34.244 --> 00:35.453
Hello?

00:45.630 --> 00:47.090
Oh, my God...

00:55.640 --> 00:57.141
Nancy!

01:00.979 --> 01:02.355
Hey, what's the matter?

01:03.773 --> 01:05.441
Nothing.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.596
You're so beautiful.

01:42.854 --> 01:44.355
Nancy!

03:25.248 --> 03:26.499
Steve?

03:29.377 --> 03:31.504
-Hey, Steve.
-Mmm.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.258
I'll...

03:36.676 --> 03:38.302
see you tomorrow, okay?

03:40.430 --> 03:41.431
Mmm-hmm.

04:15.798 --> 04:17.633
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

04:17.717 --> 04:18.885
Oh, I scared you?

04:18.968 --> 04:20.178
I know, I should have called.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.846
Where have you been?

04:21.929 --> 04:23.389
We agreed on 10:00.

04:23.473 --> 04:26.434
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

04:26.517 --> 04:27.518
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

04:27.602 --> 04:29.771
You didn't think to call and let me know?

04:29.854 --> 04:31.522
With everything that's been going on?

04:31.606 --> 04:34.358
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

04:34.442 --> 04:36.194
I'm sorry, Mom.
What more do you want?

04:36.277 --> 04:37.570
Hey, wait...

04:37.653 --> 04:38.821
Whose sweatshirt is that?

04:40.573 --> 04:41.574
Steve's.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.367
Steve's.

04:44.535 --> 04:45.703
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

04:45.787 --> 04:47.079
What?

04:47.163 --> 04:48.164
No!

04:48.247 --> 04:51.292
It was just cold,
so I borrowed his sweatshirt.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.627
It's not a big deal.

04:53.628 --> 04:54.879
Nancy?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.547
What?

04:58.049 --> 05:00.009
You can talk to me.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.970
You can talk to me.
Whatever happened.

05:03.054 --> 05:05.765
Nothing happened.

05:08.226 --> 05:09.769
Nancy.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.689
Nothing happened.

05:15.650 --> 05:17.151
Can I please go?

05:42.051 --> 05:44.011
Will? Will?

05:45.513 --> 05:47.765
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

05:47.848 --> 05:48.849
Will...

05:48.933 --> 05:50.184
Please...

05:50.268 --> 05:51.894
Will...

05:53.938 --> 05:54.981
It's me.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.568
It's me. Just talk to me.
Talk to me.

05:58.651 --> 06:00.653
Just say...

06:00.736 --> 06:02.905
-Mom?
-Jonathan!

06:02.989 --> 06:05.866
- Come here. Come here.
- Mom, what is this?

06:05.950 --> 06:08.494
Come here. Come here.

06:08.578 --> 06:10.913
-What's going on?
-It's Will. It's Will, he's...

06:10.997 --> 06:12.832
he's trying to talk to me.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.004
-He's trying to talk to you?
-Yes, through... through the lights.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.213
-Mom--
-I know.

06:19.297 --> 06:20.673
I know.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.883
Just... just watch.

06:22.967 --> 06:26.554
Will... your brother's here.

06:28.014 --> 06:30.433
Can you show him what you showed me, baby?

06:32.768 --> 06:34.312
Please...
Did you see that?

06:34.395 --> 06:36.355
It's the electricity, Mom.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.690
- It's acting up.
- No.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.358
It's the same thing that fried the phone.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.986
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.280
Something is going on here!

06:44.363 --> 06:46.991
-Yesterday, the wall--
-What? What about the wall?

06:47.074 --> 06:49.243
-I don't know. I don't know.
-Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

06:49.327 --> 06:51.704
I just know that Will is here.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.289
--No, Mom.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.042
- Maybe if I get more lamps--
- No, Mom.

06:56.125 --> 07:00.546
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

07:00.630 --> 07:02.798
He is just lost.

07:02.882 --> 07:06.969
People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

07:07.053 --> 07:08.638
Okay.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.932
-This isn't helping.
-Okay, okay.

07:11.015 --> 07:13.309
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.645
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

07:15.728 --> 07:17.480
Can you just try and get some sleep?

07:17.563 --> 07:20.232
- Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me?

07:20.316 --> 07:21.567
-I promise. I will.
-Yeah?

07:21.651 --> 07:23.611
-Yeah.
-I just need to sit here for a minute.

07:24.779 --> 07:26.572
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

07:26.656 --> 07:28.157
-Okay.
-Yeah?

07:38.542 --> 07:39.752
Will?

07:43.381 --> 07:45.841
We just tell our parents
we have AV Club after school.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.511
That'll give us at least a few hours
for Operation Mirkwood.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.139
You seriously think that
the weirdo knows where Will is?

07:52.223 --> 07:53.933
-Just trust me on this, okay?
-Okay.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.518
-Did you get the supplies?
-Yeah.

07:55.601 --> 07:58.229
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.481
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.025
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

08:03.109 --> 08:05.277
and the wrist rocket.

08:05.361 --> 08:07.363
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon
with a slingshot?

08:07.446 --> 08:09.907
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

08:09.991 --> 08:12.326
And second of all,
the Demogorgon's not real.

08:12.410 --> 08:13.411
It's made up.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.747
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

08:18.040 --> 08:20.501
- and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get?

08:24.422 --> 08:25.589
Well, alrighty.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.924
So, we've got...

08:27.008 --> 08:30.386
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

08:30.469 --> 08:33.014
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

08:33.097 --> 08:35.266
-banana, and trail mix.
-Seriously?

08:35.349 --> 08:37.852
We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.

08:37.935 --> 08:40.062
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

08:40.146 --> 08:42.773
- We have her.
- She shut one door!

08:42.857 --> 08:44.025
With her mind!

08:44.108 --> 08:46.777
Are you kidding me?
That's insane!

08:46.861 --> 08:49.739
Imagine all the other cool stuff
she could do.

08:49.822 --> 08:50.906
Like...

08:51.782 --> 08:55.453
I bet... that she could make this fly!

08:57.788 --> 08:59.165
Hey. Hey.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.833
Okay, concentrate.
Okay?

09:02.835 --> 09:04.211
Okay, one more time.

09:05.421 --> 09:07.548
- Okay.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.341
Use your powers, okay?

09:11.010 --> 09:12.428
- Idiot.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.180
- She's not a dog!
- Boys!

09:14.263 --> 09:16.015
Time for school!

09:18.184 --> 09:19.226
Just stay down here.

09:19.310 --> 09:21.562
Don't make any noise,
and don't leave.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.106
If you get hungry,
eat Dustin's snacks, okay?

09:24.190 --> 09:26.067
- Michael!
- Coming!

09:26.150 --> 09:27.526
You know those power lines?

09:27.610 --> 09:29.403
-Power lines?
-Yeah.

09:29.487 --> 09:30.529
The ones behind my house?

09:30.613 --> 09:31.822
Yes.

09:31.906 --> 09:33.449
Meet us there, after school.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.201
After school?

09:35.284 --> 09:36.619
Yeah, 3:15.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.830
Ah.

09:45.711 --> 09:48.506
When the numbers read three-one-five,
meet us there.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.800
"Three-one-five."

09:50.883 --> 09:52.843
Three-one-five.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.412
Hey!

10:20.496 --> 10:21.580
Hey!

10:22.540 --> 10:24.166
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah!

10:24.250 --> 10:25.709
Yeah, totally.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.795
I just...

10:29.421 --> 10:32.216
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.801
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.136
I know.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.054
I know.
Of course not.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.683
But what about, like, Tommy,
and Carol and them?

10:40.766 --> 10:41.851
You're being paranoid.

10:42.852 --> 10:45.312
-I'm sorry.
-No. No, it's cute.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.524
Hey...

10:48.607 --> 10:50.276
I had a good time.

10:52.153 --> 10:53.320
Yeah.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.115
Yeah.
Me, too.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.087
Mmm.
Hmm.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.564
Hey, Ally.
Where's Barb?

11:28.647 --> 11:30.482
Um, shouldn't you know?

11:30.566 --> 11:32.735
You haven't seen her anywhere...
at all?

11:38.449 --> 11:40.993
There she is.
Emerald City.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.203
I heard they make
space weapons in there.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.288
Space weapons?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.498
Yeah. You know, like,
Reagan's Star Wars.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.251
I guess we're gonna blow
the Ruskies to smithereens.

11:50.586 --> 11:51.587
Hey, can I help you?

11:52.630 --> 11:54.632
Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.508
Oh, we don't give tours.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.636
Okay...
A quick look around.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.347
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh...

12:01.430 --> 12:03.015
Rick Schaeffer
at the Department of Energy.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.184
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.102
We have reason to believe
he might have snuck in here.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.647
Like I said,
you have to speak to Mr. Schaeffer.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.943
-What's your name?
-Patrick.

12:14.026 --> 12:17.613
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor,
and I got reporters breathing down my neck

12:17.696 --> 12:19.281
and I got a very upset mother.

12:20.699 --> 12:24.870
Now, I know the kid's not in there,
but I gotta check off this box.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.166
Patrick, would you do me a favor?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.795
Would you speak to your boss
and see what you can swing for us?

12:34.046 --> 12:35.381
I'd really appreciate it.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.342
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

13:48.579 --> 13:51.498
...was occupying a large part of Lebanon.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.751
Today, Syria has become a home for--

13:56.295 --> 13:58.964
I have the power!

13:59.048 --> 14:00.674
...gift that will last forever.

- Just ring me up, Donald.

16:38.457 --> 16:41.502
And you think this missing boy
may have crawled through there?

16:41.585 --> 16:44.213
Well, that was the idea.

16:44.296 --> 16:46.715
Yeah, I just don't see
how that'd be possible.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.509
We've got over 100 cameras.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.220
Every square inch covered,
plus all my guys.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.388
No one breaks in here.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.098
Certainly not some kid.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.601
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?

17:03.315 --> 17:05.567
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you guys do in here?

17:05.651 --> 17:07.402
You're asking the wrong guy.

17:07.486 --> 17:11.532
-Staying one step ahead of the Russians?
-I expect. Something like that.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.034
-Who's in charge here?
-That'd be Dr. Brenner.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.994
And he builds the space lasers?

17:16.078 --> 17:17.913
-Space lasers?
-Ignore him.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.001
This is the night of the 6th and 7th
we're seeing here?

17:23.085 --> 17:24.419
That's correct.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.558
Is that it?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.561
Like I said, we would have seen him.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.024
The night of the 7th,
we had a search party out for Will.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.818
You remember anything about that night?

17:47.901 --> 17:50.153
Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.823
-'Cause of the storm.
-Yeah, a lot of rain that night.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.575
You see any rain on that tape?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.202
What are you thinking?

17:58.537 --> 17:59.830
I don't know.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.041
But they're lying.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.330
That's why science doesn't
make any damn sense to me.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.083
No, I swear. Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.

20:50.167 --> 20:53.378
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.

20:53.462 --> 20:55.297
Well, if it's not frostbite,
then what is it?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.215
Ugh, I don't care what it is,
it's disgusting!

20:57.299 --> 20:59.009
Get it off the table.
We're eating here.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.385
- Ew!

21:01.303 --> 21:03.096
Hey, Tommy.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.056
When you left, did you see Barb?

21:05.140 --> 21:07.559
-What?
-Barbara.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.102
She's not here today.

21:09.186 --> 21:12.314
I seriously have no idea
who you're talking about.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.566
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you...

21:14.649 --> 21:16.485
Did you see her leave last night or not?

21:17.360 --> 21:20.197
No, she was gone when we left.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.741
Probably couldn't stand
listening to all that moaning.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.661
Oh, Steve!

21:26.745 --> 21:30.165
-Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve!
-Oh, Steve...

21:30.248 --> 21:32.334
- Oh, Steve!

21:32.417 --> 21:34.002
- Okay, chill.

21:34.085 --> 21:38.006
Listen... I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just...

21:38.089 --> 21:40.592
she's probably just, like,
skipping or something.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.093
Yeah.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.762
Yeah, probably.

22:01.154 --> 22:04.074
- How about this one?
- Too big for the sling.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.411
So, do you think Eleven was born
with her powers, like the X-Men,

22:08.495 --> 22:11.790
or do you think she acquired them, like...
like Green Lantern?

22:11.873 --> 22:15.001
She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.504
Why does that matter?
The X-Men are weirdos.

22:17.587 --> 22:20.048
If you love her so much,
why don't you marry her?

22:20.131 --> 22:21.466
What are you talking about?

22:21.550 --> 22:23.051
-Mike, seriously?
-What?

22:23.134 --> 22:25.178
You look at her all, like...

22:25.262 --> 22:27.722
"Hi, El! El! El! El!

22:27.806 --> 22:29.182
I love you so much!

22:29.266 --> 22:31.101
- Would you marry me?"
- Shut up, Lucas.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.686
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.522
What are you losers
doing back here?

22:35.605 --> 22:37.148
Probably looking for their missing friend.

22:37.232 --> 22:40.151
That's not funny.
It's serious. He's in danger.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.405
I hate to break it to you, Toothless,
but he's not in danger.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.865
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.

22:45.949 --> 22:48.243
He said he was probably killed
by some other queer.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.413
Come on.
Just ignore them.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.295
Watch where you're going, Frogface.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.631
-You all right?
-Yeah.

23:07.262 --> 23:08.930
Hey.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.515
How about this one?

23:11.349 --> 23:14.102
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

23:14.185 --> 23:15.604
Yeah, this is it.

23:15.687 --> 23:17.606
Oh, yeah.

23:17.689 --> 23:20.066
- Yeah, this is the monster killer!

23:20.150 --> 23:21.192
Whoo!

23:47.427 --> 23:48.428
Hey.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.139
Oh, hey.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.265
-Hey!
-Hey, Karen.

24:34.349 --> 24:35.350
Hi...

24:37.936 --> 24:38.978
I brought you a casserole.

24:40.188 --> 24:42.190
Oh! Thank you, uh...

24:43.233 --> 24:45.819
Uh, you wanna... come in?

25:02.043 --> 25:05.171
Hey, Marissa.
How you doin'?

25:06.631 --> 25:08.633
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.051
What?

25:10.135 --> 25:12.137
You could have at least called, said,

25:12.220 --> 25:16.683
"Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.
Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."

25:18.143 --> 25:19.269
Yep.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.315
I'm sorry. Uh...

25:24.399 --> 25:26.776
Maybe we could go out again next week?

25:31.906 --> 25:34.409
Newspapers?
You guys got newspapers around here?

25:35.076 --> 25:37.912
We have the New York Times,
the Post, all the big ones.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.539
Organized by year and topic.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.333
You can find the corresponding microfiche
in the reading room.

25:42.417 --> 25:45.211
Okay, we're looking for anything
on the Hawkins National Laboratory.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.046
Well, shouldn't you be looking
for that missing kid?

25:47.130 --> 25:49.299
Yeah. We are.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.343
Uh, so, why don't you start
with the Times,

25:52.427 --> 25:53.845
and we'll check out the Post.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.397
The librarian?

26:49.275 --> 26:51.903
Will always loved
Christmas, you know.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.280
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

26:55.281 --> 26:56.950
I don't know, he...

26:57.033 --> 26:58.701
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.286
It's silly, I know.

27:00.370 --> 27:03.414
No.
No, it's not silly.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.500
How is Jonathan holding up?

27:05.583 --> 27:08.545
You know,
he's good at taking care of himself.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.588
He always has been, you know?

27:10.672 --> 27:11.923
I...

27:12.006 --> 27:15.176
I mean,
he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...

27:17.470 --> 27:18.805
Is something the matter?

27:18.888 --> 27:20.223
Uh, no.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.558
No, I just...

27:21.641 --> 27:23.852
We're having electrical problems.

27:23.935 --> 27:25.061
Joyce.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.564
I want you to know something.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.775
If you need anything, anything at all...

27:30.859 --> 27:32.402
Ted and I are here for you.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.529
Thank you.
Thanks.

27:34.612 --> 27:35.905
Okay.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.741
How... how's Mike
dealing with this?

27:38.825 --> 27:40.618
Is he, uh, okay?

27:40.702 --> 27:43.663
Mike?
Uh... I don't know.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.290
He skipped school yesterday.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.334
He's never done anything like that before.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.959
--Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

28:32.629 --> 28:34.130
Oh, where's Holly?

28:47.060 --> 28:48.436
Hey!

28:49.020 --> 28:50.188
She shouldn't be here.

28:50.271 --> 28:53.775
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's quite the explorer these days.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.111
-Wait, did you see something?
-Yeah.

28:57.195 --> 28:58.863
What did... what did you see?
Tell me.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.823
-What did you see? What--
-Joyce... Joyce!

29:00.907 --> 29:04.786
Listen... Karen,
thank you for the casserole,

29:04.869 --> 29:06.120
but I need you to leave.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.914
Okay?

29:09.165 --> 29:11.501
--Come on, come on, come on...

29:13.294 --> 29:15.546
- Hello?
- Hi.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.507
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.967
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

29:19.050 --> 29:20.093
Good.
I'm good.

29:20.176 --> 29:23.388
Um, I was just wondering, uh,
is Barb there?

29:23.471 --> 29:25.431
Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.

29:26.516 --> 29:28.893
But she did come home, right?
After the vigil?

29:28.977 --> 29:32.230
No, she said she was staying
with you last night.

29:32.313 --> 29:36.109
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.

29:36.192 --> 29:39.362
I meant, did she come home this morning?

29:39.445 --> 29:42.615
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

29:42.699 --> 29:44.909
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

29:45.952 --> 29:49.914
Do-- Do you know what?
I just remembered... she's at the library.

29:49.998 --> 29:53.626
Nancy, will you please have her call me
as soon as you find her?

29:53.710 --> 29:55.670
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.089
Sorry to bother you.

30:11.436 --> 30:13.146
Hey, man.

30:13.229 --> 30:14.272
What's going on?

30:14.355 --> 30:16.357
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.735
- We've heard great things.
- Yeah, sounds cool.

30:18.818 --> 30:22.530
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

30:22.613 --> 30:24.574
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:24.657 --> 30:25.867
- Oh, no? Oh...
- Hey.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.161
Please, give me my bag.
No, just...

30:28.244 --> 30:30.705
Man, he is totally trembling.
He must really have something to hide.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.040
Here we go.

30:32.123 --> 30:33.833
Ah...

30:33.916 --> 30:34.917
Here we go.

30:36.461 --> 30:37.712
- Oh, man.
- Let me see.

30:39.547 --> 30:40.548
Dude.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.551
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.261
- I was looking for my brother.
- No.

30:45.345 --> 30:48.097
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.

30:48.723 --> 30:51.434
-What's going on?
-Here's the starring lady.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.643
What?

30:52.727 --> 30:54.771
This creep was spying on us last night.

30:56.064 --> 30:58.107
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

31:02.153 --> 31:06.657
See, you can tell
that he knows it was wrong, but...

31:06.741 --> 31:08.785
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

31:09.827 --> 31:10.828
It's hardwired into 'em.

31:10.912 --> 31:13.790
You know, they just can't help themselves.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.752
--So...

31:18.920 --> 31:20.546
we'll just have to take away his toy.

31:21.089 --> 31:22.757
-Steve...
-No, please, not the camera.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.550
No, no, wait, wait...
Tommy, Tommy.

31:25.510 --> 31:27.553
--It's okay.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.640
Here you go, man.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.522
Come on, let's go.
The game's about to start.

31:39.148 --> 31:40.233
Boo.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.611
--Bye.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.169
Hey, Nance!

32:00.253 --> 32:01.504
Come on.

32:28.197 --> 32:29.365
Three-one-five.

32:30.283 --> 32:32.034
Three-one-five.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.327
Three-one-five.

33:40.394 --> 33:43.022
No! No!

33:43.105 --> 33:45.399
Papa! Papa!

33:45.483 --> 33:46.776
Papa!

33:46.859 --> 33:48.945
Papa!

33:49.028 --> 33:50.321
Papa!

33:53.991 --> 33:54.992
No!

34:46.419 --> 34:47.503
Incredible.

35:41.432 --> 35:42.725
El!

35:44.685 --> 35:46.228
You okay?

35:48.648 --> 35:50.608
Hop on.
We only have a few hours.

36:01.494 --> 36:04.080
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

36:04.163 --> 36:07.249
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

36:07.333 --> 36:08.709
- blow me."

36:08.793 --> 36:11.128
Bull, if you did that,
you'd be in detention right now.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.672
Saturday.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.548
I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

36:14.632 --> 36:15.758
Oh, he's so a virgin!

36:15.841 --> 36:18.761
Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.

36:20.680 --> 36:21.806
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

36:21.889 --> 36:24.433
I totally forgot.

36:24.517 --> 36:26.102
I told my mom I would, um...

36:26.185 --> 36:27.645
I would do something with her.

36:27.728 --> 36:29.605
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.148
I'm sorry.

36:32.525 --> 36:35.152
What the hell's wrong with her?

36:35.236 --> 36:38.197
Maybe she freaked out
when you went all psycho on the psycho.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.281
Oh, give me a break.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.659
What'd you expect,
dating Miss Perfect?

36:48.207 --> 36:49.667
Why did they hurt you?

36:50.835 --> 36:51.877
What?

36:54.338 --> 36:55.464
Oh, that.

36:55.548 --> 36:56.549
Uh...

36:56.632 --> 36:58.300
I just fell at recess.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.429
-Mike...
-Yeah?

37:01.512 --> 37:02.972
Friends tell the truth.

37:06.183 --> 37:09.019
I was tripped by this mouth breather,
Troy, okay?

37:09.103 --> 37:10.563
Mouth breather?

37:10.688 --> 37:12.565
Yeah, you know...

37:12.648 --> 37:13.774
a dumb person.

37:13.858 --> 37:15.025
A knucklehead.

37:15.109 --> 37:16.193
Knucklehead?

37:17.820 --> 37:20.906
I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.

37:20.990 --> 37:23.826
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

37:23.909 --> 37:26.036
-Mike...
-Yeah?

37:26.120 --> 37:27.621
I understand.

37:28.539 --> 37:29.957
Oh.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.792
Okay, cool.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.085
Cool.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.484
Barb?

37:58.652 --> 37:59.987
Barb!

38:18.380 --> 38:19.715
Barb?

38:30.351 --> 38:31.727
Barb?

38:49.203 --> 38:50.496
Barb?

38:52.498 --> 38:53.499
Oh!

40:05.821 --> 40:08.574
Will... are you here?

40:12.202 --> 40:14.038
Okay, good, good, good, good.

40:14.955 --> 40:15.998
Are you...

40:16.081 --> 40:20.127
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.671
Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

40:22.755 --> 40:23.797
Can you do...

40:26.091 --> 40:28.594
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

40:29.595 --> 40:31.805
Baby, I need to know...

40:32.973 --> 40:35.434
Are you alive?

40:43.233 --> 40:44.693
Are you safe?

40:55.579 --> 40:59.124
I need to know where to find you, honey.
Where... where are you?

40:59.208 --> 41:02.670
Can you...
can you tell me where you are?

41:02.753 --> 41:04.088
Can you...

41:05.005 --> 41:08.759
Please, baby.
I need to find you. Tell me what to do.

41:11.053 --> 41:12.721
Please just...

41:15.808 --> 41:17.142
Will...

41:43.877 --> 41:46.296
Hey! You're home early!
How was the game?

41:49.091 --> 41:51.719
Nancy?
What's the matter?

41:52.636 --> 41:53.887
It's Barb.

41:53.971 --> 41:55.180
I think...

41:56.598 --> 41:58.475
something happened.

41:58.559 --> 42:01.478
Something terrible.

42:03.605 --> 42:04.898
I don't know, Chief.

42:04.982 --> 42:06.233
What don't you know?

42:06.316 --> 42:09.486
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

42:09.570 --> 42:13.615
Her kid was taken
for LSD mind control experiments?

42:13.699 --> 42:14.783
She's been discredited.

42:14.867 --> 42:15.951
--Claim was thrown out--

42:16.035 --> 42:17.161
Okay, forget about her.

42:17.953 --> 42:19.496
Take a look at this.

42:19.580 --> 42:21.790
-Dr. Martin Brenner.
-Who?

42:21.874 --> 42:23.500
Brenner.

42:23.584 --> 42:25.502
He runs Hawkins Lab.

42:25.586 --> 42:26.628
Okay.

42:27.963 --> 42:30.215
You don't find that interesting?

42:30.299 --> 42:31.717
Not really.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.678
He was involved in some hippie crap
back in the day, so what?

42:34.762 --> 42:38.932
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

42:39.016 --> 42:41.143
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

42:41.226 --> 42:44.229
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

42:44.313 --> 42:46.523
Now, that piece of fabric
that the teacher found by the pipe.

42:46.607 --> 42:48.525
That sure looked
like a hospital gown to me, huh?

42:48.609 --> 42:51.028
-Am I wrong?
-I don't know, Chief.

42:51.111 --> 42:52.446
Come on, man.

42:52.529 --> 42:54.823
Work with me here.

42:54.907 --> 42:57.493
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

42:57.576 --> 42:58.827
I'm just...

43:03.248 --> 43:04.958
I'm saying maybe something happened.

43:06.043 --> 43:09.880
Maybe Will was in the wrong place
at the wrong time

43:09.963 --> 43:11.882
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

43:13.092 --> 43:15.636
-It's a reach.
-It's a start.

43:15.719 --> 43:18.263
Hey, Powell,
is the chief with you?

43:19.014 --> 43:20.557
Hopper here.
What do you got?

44:04.101 --> 44:05.185
Here.

44:05.269 --> 44:07.813
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

44:08.355 --> 44:09.439
Hiding.

44:09.523 --> 44:12.151
No, no, this is where he lives.

44:12.234 --> 44:14.236
He's missing from here.
Understand?

44:17.364 --> 44:19.783
- What are we doing here?
- She said he's hiding here.

44:19.867 --> 44:21.577
Um... no!

44:21.660 --> 44:24.329
I swear, if we walked
all the way out here for nothing--

44:24.413 --> 44:25.914
That's exactly what we did.

44:25.998 --> 44:29.042
I told you she didn't know
what the hell she was talking about!

44:30.043 --> 44:31.837
- Why did you bring us here?

44:31.920 --> 44:35.132
-Mike, don't waste your time with her.
-What do you want to do then?

44:35.215 --> 44:36.800
Call the cops,
like we should have done yesterday.

44:36.884 --> 44:38.468
- We are not calling the cops!
- Hey, guys?

44:38.552 --> 44:40.762
-What other choice do we have?
-Guys!

44:49.313 --> 44:50.689
Will...

45:08.916 --> 45:10.000
Okay.

45:10.083 --> 45:12.419
Okay, baby, talk to me.

45:12.502 --> 45:14.212
Talk to me.
Where are you?

45:15.589 --> 45:17.883
"R." Good, good, good, good.

45:17.966 --> 45:19.343
That's good.
Come on, come on.

45:19.927 --> 45:21.178
"I...

45:21.887 --> 45:23.388
G...

45:23.472 --> 45:25.140
H... T...

45:25.849 --> 45:27.100
H...

45:27.184 --> 45:28.185
E...

45:28.310 --> 45:30.312
R... E..."

45:30.395 --> 45:31.980
"Right here."

45:32.981 --> 45:34.107
"Right here"?

45:34.191 --> 45:36.860
I don't know what that means.

45:36.944 --> 45:39.237
I need you to tell me what to do.

45:39.321 --> 45:40.322
What should I do?

45:40.405 --> 45:43.659
How do I get to you? How do I find you?
What should I do?

46:50.976 --> 46:52.144
Oh, Jesus.

47:00.027 --> 47:02.404
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.

47:30.390 --> 47:33.351
It's not Will.
It can't be.

47:41.902 --> 47:44.488
It's Will.
It's really Will.

47:51.244 --> 47:52.412
Mike...

47:52.496 --> 47:54.664
- "Mike"? "Mike," what?

47:54.748 --> 47:56.875
You were supposed to help us
find him alive.

47:56.958 --> 47:58.376
You said he was alive!

47:58.460 --> 47:59.878
Why did you lie to us?

48:00.670 --> 48:02.172
What's wrong with you?

48:02.255 --> 48:04.007
What is wrong with you?

48:04.674 --> 48:06.301
- Mike...
- What?

48:09.679 --> 48:12.224
Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.

48:12.307 --> 48:13.350
Mike...

48:13.433 --> 48:16.103
Mike, where are you going?
Mike!

48:21.024 --> 48:22.275
Mike!

48:32.619 --> 48:34.287
--Mom?

48:35.997 --> 48:38.250
- Mom, what happened?

48:38.333 --> 48:39.584
It's okay.

48:40.752 --> 48:41.920
Hey.

48:47.259 --> 48:48.510
Michael?

48:50.262 --> 48:51.471
What's wrong?
