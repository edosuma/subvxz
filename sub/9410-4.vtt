You know how long I've been a rabbit?
The humiliation I've endured?

13:43.333 --> 13:47.167
I met Amazo when I was just a young
boy starting out in the world of magic.

13:47.167 --> 13:48.667
- He was my hero.
- Mine too!

13:49.167 --> 13:50.667
That severed head routine
with the guillotine--

13:50.667 --> 13:52.100
A terrific gag.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.233
- It should be. I invented it.
- Really? So what happened?

13:56.233 --> 13:58.567
I got to meet him backstage one time,
and he encouraged me.

13:59.067 --> 14:00.933
Before you know it,
I was on my way to being a star.

14:00.933 --> 14:03.133
Then one night I run into Amazo.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.233
I had this magic wand I wanted to
show him-- hundreds of years old.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.833
It was real magic,
not some tricked-up prop.

14:08.833 --> 14:10.833
Amazo went nuts.

14:10.833 --> 14:13.200
He stole the wand.
In fact, he stole my entire act.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.267
And if that wasn't enough,
he turned me into a "wabbit."

14:15.767 --> 14:19.400
- And now he uses me in his show.
- But what about my sister?

14:19.800 --> 14:23.133
Yeah, I can get her back.
But I need your help.

14:23.633 --> 14:26.133
I'm not too handy these days.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.800
- Well, what do I have to do?
- There's only one thing to do.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.467

with his props on stage.

Duh! How about black,

- Try the cupboard.
- You're awfully grouchy.

you'd bring my sister back first.
