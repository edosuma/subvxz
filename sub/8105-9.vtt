WEBVTT

00:00.209 --> 00:01.668
Blue Calamari is
still in the lead,

00:01.794 --> 00:04.379
but Ample Parking is making strides,
and is now in fourth, third,

00:04.505 --> 00:07.465
and holding second place,
while Blue Calamari
is at a steady speed.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.550
And down the stretch
they come!

00:09.677 --> 00:13.805
Ample Parking comes
from behind. And it's
Ample Parking by a nose.

00:15.432 --> 00:20.019
This is the last call for
the third race. You may
still wager if you hurry.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.813
Here's your information
on the race...

00:21.939 --> 00:23.815
Out of the way.
Cripple coming through.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.276
Sixth race at Golden Downs.

00:27.403 --> 00:32.156
I'll take the two and the four.
Hey, that's my birthday.

00:32.324 --> 00:35.660
February 4, 1963.
Do you think
that's a good bet?

00:36.161 --> 00:37.453
What's your birthday?

00:37.579 --> 00:41.082
Take your time. Don't worry.
There's only 30 seconds to post.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.293
Is there any way I can bet
on the six and the three also?

00:44.420 --> 00:47.296
You know, for the year?
All four horses.
Can I do that?

00:47.756 --> 00:52.051
He wants a $2 exacta box,
two, four, six, three.
Give him $24.

00:58.434 --> 00:59.892
Your turn.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.146
The ninth at Gulfstream Park.
$500 on the three horse,

01:03.272 --> 01:04.564
Seminole Uprising to win.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.524
Might as well burn your money.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.402
I'll burn my winnings.
Bigger flame.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.197
Same race, Termigator to win.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.826
Sorry, race just closed.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.202
Damn it.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.580
She was 14-to-1, too.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.291
Then fatass over there
just saved you money.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.667
No way Seminole Uprising's...

01:24.793 --> 01:26.878
I don't bet on the horses.
I bet on the jocks.

01:27.171 --> 01:30.173
My rider's bulimic,
purges after his weigh-ins.

01:30.632 --> 01:34.886
Leave a two-pound pile at the
starting gate, shaves valuable
time off that final eighth.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.138
Nice to have
inside information.

01:37.723 --> 01:38.806
...by a length.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.099
The Burning Bush
and on the level is Candy,

01:40.225 --> 01:42.435
right up on the inside
is Bowfinger...

01:48.942 --> 01:50.777
And Termigator
pulling up against the rail.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.904
Is anybody here a doctor?

01:58.452 --> 01:59.952
Trying to cop a feel?

02:00.078 --> 02:01.788
I took a CPR class at the Y.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.707
That would be useful if
she was having a heart attack
instead of a seizure.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.417
Seizure? Hold her tongue down?

02:06.543 --> 02:09.212
If you wanna get a finger bitten off.
Call an ambulance.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.922
Methodist's three blocks down.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.007
- I could drive her.
- Just make the call.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.309
- What the hell is that?
- How should I know?

02:23.811 --> 02:26.354
Tell the paramedics
to take her to
Princeton-Plainsboro.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.022
Her doctor's name is House.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.858
And it's Termigator,
winning by two lengths.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.062
Since when does House
hang out at OTB?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.313
The man's an addict.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.023
Right, addicted to pills,
not gambling.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.527
It's the same thing.
Drug abuse, drinking, gambling.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.154
They all fire up the same
pleasure centers in the brain.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.698
An addict is an addict
is an...

03:18.824 --> 03:20.491
Gambling doesn't take away
his pain.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.159
It does when I win.

03:22.286 --> 03:26.122
Hot OTB babe has grand mal

03:26.582 --> 03:28.708
and inexplicable bruising.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.334
What up with that?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.628
You were just standing there,
and she started to seize?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.172
Spend as much time
around the real people as I do,

03:35.299 --> 03:36.299
someone gets sick.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.593
Her platelets are 89,
she's anemic.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.762
And she has
a blood alcohol level of 0.13.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.681
Hot OTB babe?

03:44.016 --> 03:47.101
Obviously a working girl.
Probably an STD infection.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.811
No fever. No infection.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.605
Alcohol abuse explains it all.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.649
Causes seizures and affects
her blood's ability to clot,

03:53.775 --> 03:54.817
which causes bruising.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.736
Start her on heparin,
she'll be fine by morning.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.738
Except for the fact
that the bruises
are not petechial,

03:58.864 --> 04:00.197
which means it's not DIC.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.241
So the bruises were caused
by trauma.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.077
She probably got beat up
by her boyfriend. Or her pimp.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.581
What's that called
when you judge someone
before ever meeting them?

04:08.707 --> 04:10.583
She's a regular at OTB.

04:10.709 --> 04:14.629
Somehow, I don't see her
holding down a 9-to-5
and going to PTA meetings.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.173
I was there.
I have a 9-to-3 job.

04:17.299 --> 04:21.552
It could be SLE,
familial telangiectasias,
or even Cushing's.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.930
- Good. Start with those.
- Which one?

04:24.056 --> 04:26.557
Cushing's. It explains
the seizure and the bruising.

04:26.683 --> 04:27.683
Not the anemia.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.893
So she doesn't eat
a lot of meat.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.896
DIC brought on
by alcohol abuse
is far more likely.

04:32.022 --> 04:36.400
Do a full workup, H and P.
And lab her up, LP, MRI.

04:39.154 --> 04:43.157
Did you just ever so subtly
order me to get
her medical history?

04:44.034 --> 04:47.620
Cuddy put me in charge
last week, so, yeah.

04:51.249 --> 04:55.962
It was a pretend in charge,
a formality to get past
the suits in legal.

04:56.088 --> 04:59.256
Right, those licensing-board
folk love to play
dress up and pretend.

04:59.383 --> 05:02.051
Hey, no worries. I'll let you keep
your parking space.

05:02.177 --> 05:05.429
You can have it. You'll also need
my handicap placard.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.597
Bend over.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.099
You make
a pretty convincing argument.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.810
Chase killed that woman.
Now Foreman's in charge?

05:10.936 --> 05:12.645
Yeah, we have
a pecking order here.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.522
If Cameron kills somebody,
Chase takes over.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.065
There's a flow chart
in the lobby.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.734
For the next three weeks,
you answer directly
to Dr. Foreman.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.529
And I expect you here
for grand rounds at 9:00.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.823
By the way,
I like sugar in my coffee.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.494
If there's a screw up,
it's your screw up.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.623
You won't have Dr. House
to fall back on.

05:36.712 --> 05:40.548
"Do you wear a seat belt?"
Is that really relevant
to a seizure?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.716
Skip it.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.218
How about,
"Were you vaccinated for polio?"

05:44.344 --> 05:47.054
I think you gave me
the form intended for FDR.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.015
You really like
Teeny Tiny Mo in the fifth?

05:49.141 --> 05:51.100
I went 4-for-6 yesterday.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.103
You want winners?
Cure me first.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.690
"Are you generally satisfied
with your life?"

05:57.816 --> 05:59.734
It does not ask that.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.282
You know, I was gonna ask

06:06.408 --> 06:09.577
what a respectable doctor
was doing at an OTB parlor.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.872
Somehow that question
doesn't seem relevant anymore.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.374
- What's your excuse?
- It turns me on.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.127
Yeah? What else
turns you on? Drugs?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.755
Casual sex? Rough sex?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.424
Casual rough sex?

06:24.593 --> 06:27.178
- I'm a doctor. I need to know.
- No sex.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.638
Just moved here.
Haven't even found a job yet.

06:29.765 --> 06:30.931
Don't know anybody.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.600
Came here without a job.

06:33.769 --> 06:37.772
That means you didn't
move here, you moved away
from somewhere else.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.068
Does that hurt?
No.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.946
Are you on any
prescription meds?
Hormones? Prednisone?

06:46.073 --> 06:49.325
I already answered that one. I think it
was question number 20-something.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.077
Well, yeah. And I could
reach down and get it.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.037
But that would kind of spoil
the whole cool move.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.997
I'm not on any medications.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.708
- Are you a vegetarian?
- No. Why?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.836
Because you might have
something called
Cushing's syndrome,

07:00.962 --> 07:02.004
which basically means...

07:02.130 --> 07:05.716
My pituitary
is overproducing ACTH,

07:05.842 --> 07:10.638
which is causing my adrenal
glands to push too much
cortisol into my bloodstream.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.015
What a coincidence.
I'm a doctor, too.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.725
Yeah, I had it last year.

07:14.893 --> 07:19.063
They did brain surgery,
removed an adenoma
from my pituitary.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.910
What did you just say?

07:33.036 --> 07:36.622
"You were right, House.
Her pituitary tumor regrew.
It is Cushing's.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.415
Uncanny how you do that."

07:38.542 --> 07:40.376
Actually,
it was Cameron's idea.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.169
No, Cameron had three ideas.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.839
I chose one to encourage,
to nurture...

07:44.965 --> 07:46.757
Yeah, you're all about
the nurturing.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.634
Do you need a hug?

07:51.012 --> 07:53.013
I don't see any regrowth.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.807
You get her medical records
faxed over?

07:54.933 --> 07:57.685
Work smart, not hard.
That's my philosophy, boss.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.728
I'll take that as a no.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.899
Anica, I need you
to stay completely still.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.526
Sorry.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.614
Still don't see anything.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.701
Okay, so it's a microadenoma.
Too small to see.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.161
So small,
it's not even there.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.205
Right. It's just a coincidence
that I predicted
a rare condition

08:18.331 --> 08:19.665
that she happened to have
a year ago.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.000
Results from her LP
back yet?

08:21.126 --> 08:23.836
Didn't do an LP.
I knew what she had.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.756
Go do the LP.

08:33.930 --> 08:37.850
Okay, I need you
to roll over on your side,
kiss your kneecaps.

08:38.476 --> 08:39.727
Party time.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.563
I thought it only took
one doctor to do this.

08:42.689 --> 08:43.772
I'm observing.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.108
She's here to make sure
I don't paralyze you.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.319
You've done this before,
right?

08:48.445 --> 08:49.570
Successfully?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.447
He's kidding.
He's an excellent doctor.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.699
I'm going to numb
the area with some lidocaine,

08:53.825 --> 08:55.701
and then we're off
to the races.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.286
See what I did there?

08:57.412 --> 09:00.873
I used horse-racing jargon
to make the patient
feel more comfortable.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.542
Okay, here we go.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.254
Felt like bone.
Does that hurt?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.006
A little bit.
What are you doing?

09:10.342 --> 09:11.884
Try rounding your back
a bit more.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.677
You're perfect
just the way you are.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.388
Oops, that was all me.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.016
Might want to move down
one vertebra.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.602
This is actually much harder
than I remember.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.314
My chest feels
a little tight.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.815
Try taking a deep breath.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.609
Dr. House,
maybe I should take it
from here.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.860
Eighth time's the charm.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.571
You trying
to piss off Foreman?

09:32.739 --> 09:34.365
Just let...

09:34.532 --> 09:35.950
BP's 240 over 140.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.493
Turn that thing off,
will you?

09:37.619 --> 09:38.744
Take the needle out.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.621
- Take the needle out!
- Okay.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.294
It's a hypertensive crisis.
Start her on an
IV lopressor drip.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.172
Titrate to systolic
less than 140.
She'll be fine.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.758
Cameron. Meet me in my office.

09:53.218 --> 09:57.721
At the risk
of sounding redundant
and right, again,

09:57.889 --> 10:00.766
she has Cushing's. Cushing's.

10:00.892 --> 10:04.478
Right, the fact that
you mangled her LP
has nothing to do with it.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.605
Actually, it has
everything to do with it.

10:06.731 --> 10:10.484
Cushing's plus stress
equals hypertensive crisis.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.569
Smart move,
sending the rookie.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.948
Her initial symptoms
could have been caused
by alcohol-induced DIC.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.783
She had a hypertensive crisis

10:17.909 --> 10:19.827
because it's been at least
six hours since she had
her last drink.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.995
She's detoxing.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.956
The exact same moment
that I'm futilely trying
to give her an LP?

10:24.082 --> 10:27.918
Right. An invisible tumor
on her pituitary
is much more likely.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.837
What if the tumor
is somewhere else?

10:29.963 --> 10:33.424
There could be
an ACTH-secreting tumor
on her lung or pancreas.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.508
It's awfully rare.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.051
Not as rare
as an invisible tumor.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.679
Why didn't they put you
in charge instead of Foreman?

10:38.805 --> 10:41.765
Oh, yeah, you're the guy
that killed that woman.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.185
Get a pan-man scan
before she dies a cortisol OD.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.400
Fine. Do it.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.445
But when you
don't find anything,
put her on a Librium taper

10:54.571 --> 10:57.489
for the withdrawal
and get her a bed
in a rehab clinic.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.753
Lungs look clean.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.756
Her lymph nodes
are not enlarged.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.926
Cuddy tapped Foreman
to run the department.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.846
- I didn't even get asked.
- Neither did I.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.806
- You were suspended.
- I was kidding.

11:22.974 --> 11:26.894
It's the irony of women
in charge. They don't like
other women in charge.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.564
What? You think
it's something else?

11:31.316 --> 11:34.443
You sabotaged yourself.
You went on a date with House.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.446
You slept with me.
Putting you in charge
of this department

11:37.572 --> 11:40.240
is like a
sexual harassment suit
waiting to happen.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.867
Yeah, they're really worried

11:41.993 --> 11:44.203
that I'm gonna create
a hostile work environment.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.330
Maybe that's the problem.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.875
Being in charge
means having
to say no to House.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.419
Would you hire you for that?

11:55.340 --> 11:58.967
Anderson coming out strong.
What is he thinking?

11:59.094 --> 12:01.553
He watched
what Tom Mants just did.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.641
You ordered MRIs
for the entire maternity ward?

12:06.142 --> 12:07.976
I was in a crazy mood.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.062
Good thing I got
a new boss to back me up.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.272
Although, I think
one of those
is actually necessary.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.858
Better comb through
before you cancel them all.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.615
What do you expect me to do,
House? Quit? Cry?

12:21.783 --> 12:24.701
Actually, I expect you
to act like what you are.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.329
My employee. My subordinate.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.665
My bitch.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.750
Well,
since you asked nicely...

12:31.876 --> 12:32.918
My God.

12:33.044 --> 12:36.255
I can't believe I got
more than a year behind
on my discharge summaries.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.716
Got to get caught up.
Oh, no, wait.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.845
I'm not authorized to sign
these anymore. Only you are.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.681
Keep it coming.
I'm not gonna break.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.852
Scan showed a mass
on her pancreas.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.980
Looks malignant.
Probably inoperable.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.733
I'd give her two months.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.532
On the bright side,
it still means I was right.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.042
Where's Dr. House?

13:14.169 --> 13:16.378
Dr. Foreman's
overseeing your case.

13:16.796 --> 13:21.508
He thought it'd be best
if I spoke with you. We found
a mass in your pancreas.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.886
It looks like cancer.

13:24.846 --> 13:28.265
So something in my pancreas
caused me to have a seizure?

13:29.225 --> 13:32.978
Probably.
But the bigger point is...

13:35.773 --> 13:39.568
A one-year survival rate
for pancreatic cancer
is less than 20%.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.236
So what's the treatment?

13:42.405 --> 13:47.117
We need to
biopsy the mass to see
what we're dealing with,

13:47.243 --> 13:50.662
and then we can

13:51.623 --> 13:53.081
recommend options
from there.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.625
Sounds good.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.382
I need your consent
to do the biopsy.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.348
Thanks.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.099
Wish me luck.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.519
Good luck.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.607
It was weird.
She barely reacted at all.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.277
I've had people hug me
and people take a swing at me.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.738
This was more like
she didn't even hear me.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.907
Magnify three times.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.497
House assisting.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.707
That is funny.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.628
Too bad Foreman's gonna die.

14:49.764 --> 14:54.268
Good afternoon,
I'm Dr. House. I'm gonna
be looking at your...

14:56.938 --> 14:58.272
Perfect.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.316
Excuse me.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.782
Need Dr. Foreman
in exam room one
for a consult.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.660
So, when did this start?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.579
Couple weeks ago.

15:13.913 --> 15:18.458
I didn't want to get pregnant.
Jake's not into rubbers,
so I got on the jelly.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.836
You think I'm allergic
or something?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.463
You have an infection.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.548
I'm gonna need a sample.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.091
I brought the jar.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.468
No, I meant
a sample of your...

15:35.226 --> 15:38.312
Okay. We have
a neurological problem here.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.938
There's something wrong
with my brain?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.482
Oh, yeah.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.527
Cover yourself up.
Got what I need.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.448
What's up?

15:49.574 --> 15:50.407
Smell this.

15:52.368 --> 15:56.288
Smells like vaginosis,
but it's not really my call.

15:56.414 --> 16:00.167
Great. I'll be sure to put
a gold star by your name
on the board.

16:00.585 --> 16:04.171
Anica's biopsy
for pancreatic cancer
was negative.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.429
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some antibiotics

16:12.555 --> 16:14.514
and you probably
shouldn't have sex
for a while.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.474
How long?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.644
On an evolutionary basis,
I'd recommend forever.

16:20.021 --> 16:24.066
The mass in the pancreas
is benign. It's probably
just scar tissue.

16:24.192 --> 16:27.361
Good news. She's not
sick at all. Other than
being an alcoholic.

16:27.487 --> 16:32.240
The labs you sent yesterday
put her ACTH at 64
picograms per milliliter.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.493
She's got Cushing's.
Something set it off.

16:34.619 --> 16:38.372
It's gotta be in her brain.
Set her up for a
venous sampling.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.706
There is another possibility.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.916
Chase, hold on.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.503
How'd you get him trained
so fast? Electronic collar?

16:44.629 --> 16:45.837
Got treats in your pocket?

16:45.963 --> 16:48.715
She didn't even read
the consent form
for the pancreatic biopsy.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.883
Who reads those things?

16:50.009 --> 16:53.303
Maybe she didn't read it
because she knew that there
was nothing wrong with her.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.097
There is another explanation
for the Cushing's.

16:55.223 --> 16:59.434
Maybe she injected herself
with the ACTH. Her behavior
suggests Munchausen's.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.270
She's had
four hospitalizations
in the last four months.

17:02.397 --> 17:06.441
Well, being hospitalized
a lot certainly points to
nothing being wrong with you.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.444
She's had zero symptoms
since she got here.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.570
The scarring on her pancreas

17:10.697 --> 17:12.489
could be caused from
injecting herself
with the benzene

17:12.615 --> 17:13.907
and setting off the seizures.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.450
She's had
brain surgery.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.412
You can fake a stomachache.
You can't fake a brain tumor.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.539
You can fake an invisible one.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.377
We should check her apartment.
Look for medications,
syringes...

17:25.503 --> 17:27.546
- Venous sampling's easier.
- And more dangerous.

17:27.672 --> 17:31.591
- Not if you get caught breaking in.
- So don't get caught, House.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.554
Why do you think Cuddy
picked Foreman over me?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.806
Have I done something wrong
or is there...

17:37.932 --> 17:40.183
Will it make you shut up if I told you
she wanted someone black?

17:40.309 --> 17:42.561
How would you describe
my leadership skills?

17:42.687 --> 17:45.147
Nonexistent.
Otherwise excellent.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.941
There's more to being a leader
than being a jerk.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.152
The world will never know.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.908
No. No way. It just snowed.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.535
Yesterday.
The streets are clear.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.913
My car is right there.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.625
There's construction on Elm.
Bike will be faster.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.232
There's even books
in the bathroom.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.570
Well, either she's very smart
or she has a severe
fiber deficiency.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.704
She's got an appointment
with her ophthalmologist
on Tuesday

18:42.830 --> 18:45.457
and an appointment
with her gynecologist
on Thursday.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.543
Multiple appointments
with multiple doctors.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.253
Symptom of Munchausen's.

18:50.379 --> 18:53.673
Or, just thinking
outside the box here,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.551
she has a vagina
and trouble reading.

18:57.595 --> 19:00.889
There's three pairs
of reading glasses, each
with different prescriptions.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.767
Which would be explained
by a tumor pressing
on the optic nerve.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.519
Because you're looking
for her to have a tumor.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.521
And you're looking for...

19:07.730 --> 19:11.066
A person
with Munchausen's syndrome
drinks battery acid.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.693
But they don't go
to an ophthalmologist
to get their pupils dilated.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.113
An ophthalmologist
is a doctor.
Attention is attention.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.784
How many hospitals
have you contacted? Has one
doctor said she's crazy?

19:20.910 --> 19:23.620
- It's not Munchausen's.
- It's not your call.

19:26.791 --> 19:27.999
If you think
she's got Munchausen's,

19:28.125 --> 19:29.668
then obviously you got
something to show the man.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.587
A syringe in her apartment.
A bottle of ACTH.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.881
Munchausen's patients are good
at covering their tracks.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.509
Right. So, the fact
that we found nothing
proves there's something.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.387
Look at the pathology reports
from the surgery
she had in Chicago.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.306
They removed 30%
of her pituitary.
They found no tumor.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.308
It's possible
the surgeons just missed it.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.561
In that kind of surgery,
you're just cutting
and hoping...

19:47.687 --> 19:49.396
Of course, we're both right.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.982
Excellent solution,
everybody's happy.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.525
Come on, step up, Foreman.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.403
If you think I'm right,
order me to stick
a needle in her brain.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.697
If you think Cameron's right,
send the patient home.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.533
Either she'll be fine,
or she'll die.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.703
Do the venous sampling.
Get her consent.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.461
Nice move, boss.
Way to cover your ass.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.422
I just agreed with you.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.173
Not because
you think I'm right,

20:17.300 --> 20:20.510
you're just taking
the safe route. You're a wuss.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.889
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.561
Hey, Wilson,
guess what Foreman just did!

20:36.485 --> 20:38.111
Hi.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.116
This is a consent form
to stick a wire
into your brain.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.452
It's important for hospitals
to get these signed
for procedures

20:45.578 --> 20:47.954
that are
completely unnecessary.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.875
- Then why are you doing it?
- Because you're mentally ill.

20:52.877 --> 20:57.380
You injected yourself
with ACTH to induce Cushing's
to get attention from doctors.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.632
And so far, it's worked.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.134
I'd like to see
another doctor.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.096
- I'm not giving you what you want?
- I don't want a bitch.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.515
Just sign the forms, okay?
And I'll get out of here.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.685
Hopefully for you,
whatever you injected
yourself with won't wear off

21:10.811 --> 21:14.773
before you get the fun
of a caring and concerned
doctor cutting into your head.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.540
You chose me
to make House miserable,
didn't you?

21:32.667 --> 21:36.503
Apparently,
he's making you miserable.
That's impressive.

21:36.796 --> 21:37.879
Find someone else.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.005
No.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.132
For the first time
in six years,

21:41.258 --> 21:44.260
I'm getting copied
on all experimental tests
and procedures.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.472
Clinic hours have been
logged and completed.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.808
You've given me four months
of House's dictations

21:49.934 --> 21:51.977
so I can finally bill
insurance companies.

21:52.103 --> 21:55.230
I only did that stuff to prove
he couldn't make me miserable.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.856
Well, way to go.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.567
Now everybody's getting
what they need, even House.

21:59.694 --> 22:04.072
He gets to play mad scientist,
and this department
runs smoothly.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.992
So I'm stuck with this
for the next three weeks.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.244
Maybe longer.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.998
Would you be interested
if this wasn't just pretend?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.961
What did Mommy say?
I don't get any candy
in my stocking?

22:18.087 --> 22:19.629
Patient being prepped
for the venous sampling?

22:19.755 --> 22:23.216
Yeah, a mentally ill patient
is right on track
for a pointless procedure.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.260
Yeah, we get your objection.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.519
Foreman. Are you sure?

22:35.896 --> 22:38.314
That doesn't make any sense.
Check it again.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.151
We gotta delay
the venous sampling.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.236
Why? Her urine turning orange?

22:45.948 --> 22:47.615
How would you know that?

22:47.742 --> 22:49.367
Because
that's what rifampin does.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.202
She's not on antibiotics.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.914
But if a Munchausen's patient
thinks she's about
to get busted,

22:55.041 --> 22:57.542
she sees pills labeled
"Dangerous,
might cause seizures",

22:57.668 --> 22:59.085
she might grab a couple.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.547
And if that label
were accidentally
on a bottle of antibiotics,

23:02.673 --> 23:04.966
and if that bottle
were accidentally
left in her room...

23:05.092 --> 23:08.136
- You set her up?
- Might have. It's Munchausen's.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.347
All this, she did to herself.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.036
I don't know
what the hell
you're talking about.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.414
I had a seizure. I'm sick.
I need your help.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.166
Not from this department.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.126
The half-life
of rifampin is three hours.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.338
After that,
you'll get your psych referral
and your discharge papers.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.673
You know,
just because you stick
your fingers down your throat

23:45.800 --> 23:48.426
doesn't mean
the rest of us are screwed up.

23:48.594 --> 23:52.347
I guess
when cooperation fails,
you move on to hostility.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.557
I didn't do this to myself.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.739
100% commitment.
Sign of a good liar.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.075
Also the sign of a sociopath.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.160
What are you doing?

24:14.286 --> 24:15.954
Correcting your last note.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.790
We can't discharge her
if she's sick.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.042
Anybody ever tell you,
you write like a girl?

24:21.168 --> 24:24.420
What? You got some other explanation
for orange urine?

24:24.547 --> 24:26.965
- It's Munchausen's.
- Correct, but not complete.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.217
You just don't want to admit
that she skunked you.

24:29.343 --> 24:33.346
At the end of
The Boy Who Cried Wolf,
the wolf really does come.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.391
Then he eats the sheep,
and the boy, and his parents.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.476
- The wolf doesn't eat the parents.
- He does when I tell it.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.187
You're not telling
the story now. I am.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.107
Look, I checked her records.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.484
All her hospitalizations
were for different things.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.279
Brain tumor, fainting spells,
skin rashes, seizures.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.989
She's had every
blood test known to man

24:51.115 --> 24:52.198
and the results
are all over the map.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.076
There's only one constant,
low HCT.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.620
- The anemia's real.
- There's a million things

24:57.746 --> 24:58.997
she could have taken
to have done that.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.790
True, it could just be her MO.

25:00.916 --> 25:04.127
She self-induces
two illnesses. One always
changes, one never does.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.297
Or maybe she has Munchausen's
and aplastic anemia,

25:07.423 --> 25:09.257
which would mean,
without proper treatment,

25:09.383 --> 25:10.800
she'll continue
to get sicker, weaker,

25:10.926 --> 25:13.344
eventually she'll start
bleeding internally and die.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.388
- She's not getting sicker.
- She will.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.850
If her bone marrow was dying,
the entire blood panel
would be affected.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.643
- Her white count's normal.
- So far.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.146
- We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.
- No. No more tests.

25:23.272 --> 25:26.274
Look, you kick her to the curb
with a Munchausen's diagnosis

25:26.400 --> 25:28.943
you're guaranteeing
that no doctor will
ever listen to her again.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.696
We do more tests,
we'll only be feeding
her psychosis.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.282
The more attention
we give her,
the more she'll want.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.161
What if she doesn't know
we're testing her?

25:38.287 --> 25:40.705
House, you were wrong.
Live with it.

25:40.915 --> 25:43.374
There's probably some
blood left over
from previous tests.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.960
Blood tests alone
can't confirm aplastic anemia.

25:46.086 --> 25:49.214
Yes, I know.
That's why I want to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.174
But blood tests could show
a systemic disease.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.551
- A virus or a toxin could be the cause.
- Fine.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.762
You want to test
the extra blood?
Knock yourself out.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.388
But the patient is off-limits.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.808
And if the results
are positive, I get my biopsy?

26:03.187 --> 26:05.146
It's the safe way to go.

26:21.664 --> 26:26.084
I need all of these tests
and a PCR done on this sample.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.378
You're gonna need more blood.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.171
Patient's empty.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.965
Then I can't do it.

26:33.217 --> 26:34.342
You can try.

26:34.468 --> 26:38.972
I can try to look like
Salma Hayek, that's not
gonna make it happen.

26:43.102 --> 26:47.480
You may not have Salma's ass,
but she doesn't have
your eyes.

26:48.691 --> 26:50.233
Yeah, right.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.699
How soon you need it?

26:58.951 --> 27:01.286
Dr. Wilson, can I talk to you
about something in confidence?

27:01.412 --> 27:03.246
- Of course.
- It's about House.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.956
Oh, then no.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.458
Fine. I won't say anything.

27:10.421 --> 27:14.882
Do you think there's any way
House would take me seriously
as his boss?

27:16.260 --> 27:19.304
Where is this coming from?
Did Cuddy say something?

27:19.430 --> 27:21.472
We talked. She intimated.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.143
And you want my advice
on how to usurp him?

27:25.269 --> 27:28.980
It's very ancient Rome,
you'll need a toga,
of course, a sword.

27:29.106 --> 27:33.067
It's not a coup. I just
want to figure out some way
we can work together.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.195
I mean, I keep the team
running from an administrative
point of view,

27:36.322 --> 27:38.531
House doesn't have
to deal with the red tape.
It's a win-win.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.325
I'm sure
he'll see it that way.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.536
Do you have any advice
on how to approach him?

27:43.662 --> 27:46.164
- How to deal the guy?
- No.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.377
But you won't tell him
we talked?

27:52.338 --> 27:53.504
No.

27:55.257 --> 27:58.259
There is no way
this is going to happen.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.153
Epstein-Barr titers
are through the roof,

28:17.279 --> 28:20.156
the most common viral cause
of aplastic anemia.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.326
So what I'm saying is...

28:31.168 --> 28:33.878
- Fetal hemoglobin's also elevated.
- Just a wee bit.

28:34.004 --> 28:34.962
Could indicate...

28:35.089 --> 28:36.422
You see that in sickle cell.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.674
Not all sickle cell
patients are black.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.928
None of her other blood panels
showed any sign
of sickle cell, which means

28:42.054 --> 28:46.641
either something's changed
drastically since yesterday,
or this isn't her blood.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.226
Of course it is.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.062
Metaphorically.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.690
Look, I couldn't do the tests.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.693
I tried, but there wasn't
enough blood left over.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.321
If you'd just let me
do the biopsy.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.157
No way.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.700
I just got back
from a suspension.

29:04.827 --> 29:07.620
And if it wasn't for me,
you would've been fired.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.914
Why don't you just
get the sample yourself?

29:10.040 --> 29:11.582
Since when have you cared
what your boss said?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.960
I don't care
what anybody says,
I care what they do.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.171
Right now Blackpoleon
Blackaparte has got
the nurses on red alert.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.257
I can't get into
the patient's room.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.260
So, come on,
I'll draw the enemy fire,
you outflank them

29:22.386 --> 29:23.928
get in there,
get the bone marrow sample.

29:24.054 --> 29:24.971
Can't.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.683
Who you more afraid of?

29:32.104 --> 29:35.940
I'm not afraid of Foreman,
I agree with him.
All the tests back him up.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.276
All the tests
have not been done.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.363
You do realize that
Blackaparte's reign
is only temporary.

29:42.489 --> 29:46.492
I also realize that no matter
what I do, you're still gonna
treat me like crap.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.995
"Crap" is a relative term.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.755
I never even made it
to the room.

29:59.882 --> 30:02.967
Nurses called the attending
as soon as a trocar
was ordered.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.011
You used her real name?

30:05.304 --> 30:08.222
I just processed
your patient's
discharge papers.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.683
She's on her way out
right now.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.355
Wait up.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.733
It's all right,
she's gonna stay.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.818
- Wonderful.
- Oh, bite me.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.905
I don't need to hear
the riot act again.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.449
How'd you like
another medical test?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.201
- What?
- Sit.

30:29.286 --> 30:30.453
Why?

30:31.163 --> 30:34.332
So you don't crack your skull
when you pass out.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.334
Just do it.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.129
You know what colchicine is?

30:40.255 --> 30:41.297
No.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.466
Well, don't feel bad.
It's for gout.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.385
It's got nothing to do
with anything you've ever
pretended to have.

30:46.512 --> 30:49.096
- I'm not pretending to...
- Shut up.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.433
Colchicine decimates
your white blood cells.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.060
Leaves almost no trace.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.937
It's great for faking
your way into hospitals.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.189
- I didn't fake my way...
- Shut up.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.776
You've been
doing this for years.

31:02.027 --> 31:05.071
Don't worry,
it's probably not your fault.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.490
When you were a kid,
you had a close relative

31:07.616 --> 31:10.284
who had a chronic disease,
probably your sister.

31:11.828 --> 31:15.957
And you saw all the attention
she got while you were
left alone, ignored.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.793
And it really,
seriously screwed you up.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.921
- I do not have a relative...
- Shut up!

31:22.047 --> 31:24.507
I'm trying to give you
what you want.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.095
And save your life.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.057
You have aplastic anemia.

31:33.767 --> 31:36.269
What, are you trying
to scare me now?

31:37.145 --> 31:39.939
It means you're not
just sick in the head.

31:40.107 --> 31:42.066
Problem is,
the rest of you appears well.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.443
So I gotta make you seem
as sick as you're
supposed to be

31:44.570 --> 31:46.112
by injecting you with a drug

31:46.238 --> 31:48.864
that simulates the symptoms
that you actually have.

31:52.578 --> 31:56.706
All you need to know is,
you've hit the
Munchausen's jackpot.

31:57.165 --> 32:01.544
I'm gonna give you
a cocktail of insulin
for seizure and colchicine

32:01.837 --> 32:03.212
to kill your white count.

32:03.338 --> 32:07.008
This will absolutely confirm
my diagnosis
of aplastic anemia.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.885
There is one small catch.

32:10.220 --> 32:13.973
If you've actually done
something to yourself
to cause the anemia,

32:14.099 --> 32:15.474
then I'm wrong.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.144
And if I do what I plan to do,

32:18.812 --> 32:21.606
then the treatment
will kill you
instead of saving you.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.066
So I need to know.

32:24.276 --> 32:28.112
Have you been taking anything
besides the insulin, the ACTH,

32:28.322 --> 32:31.032
and the pills
Cameron left in your room?

32:36.997 --> 32:38.080
No.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.460
Good. Give me your arm.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.306
It was my mom.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.516
She had MS.

32:58.268 --> 33:01.020
She was in and out
of hospitals all the time.

33:01.396 --> 33:04.607
People were always trying
to do things for her.

33:05.901 --> 33:09.654
Bring her food,
or brush her hair,
or make her happy.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.823
People cared.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.663
She died when I was 16.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.710
Then there was no one.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.507
Boo-hoo.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.136
Where are you going?

33:36.056 --> 33:38.182
I obviously can't be around
when it happens.

33:38.308 --> 33:40.434
Well, what are you gonna do,
you're just gonna...

33:40.560 --> 33:42.561
Relax, you know the drill.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.690
People walk by here
all the time, you'll be fine.

34:11.383 --> 34:14.218
So, barely out the door
and she has another seizure.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.470
She must have
somehow grabbed insulin
on the way out.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.723
Once she's stable,
we need to get her out of here

34:18.849 --> 34:20.391
before she does more damage
to herself.

34:20.767 --> 34:21.892
We can't.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.311
Her white count's down.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.064
Sorry, I missed that.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.692
Hearing's been off since
the Ricky Martin concert,

34:29.818 --> 34:32.027
some cholo
kicked me in the head.

34:32.154 --> 34:35.072
White count, hematocrit,
and platelets are all off.

34:35.198 --> 34:37.950
Her bone marrow's
shutting down. She actually
has aplastic anemia.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.160
Say what?

34:39.286 --> 34:41.495
All her other labs
show nothing that would...

34:41.621 --> 34:45.624
Labs, shmabs.
A good diagnostician
reads between the labs.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.585
You were right.

34:47.711 --> 34:50.629
Hey, we're not here
to play the blame game.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.339
These things happen.

34:52.466 --> 34:55.593
Sometimes doctors
send people out
on the street to die

34:55.719 --> 34:57.553
after other doctors
have warned them

34:57.679 --> 34:59.805
that they're sending people
out on the street to die.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.266
There's no way you could know.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.810
I'll go give her the news.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.903
Who are you?

35:14.196 --> 35:17.281
I'm Dr. Foreman.
I'm in charge of your case.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.410
You have aplastic anemia,

35:21.787 --> 35:24.330
which means
your bone marrow
has shut down.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.082
Your body can't make
new blood anymore.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.335
Are you sure?

35:29.461 --> 35:32.880
I went back and checked
your old records.
It makes sense.

35:33.715 --> 35:37.384
The aplastic anemia's
apparently been
developing for months.

35:38.428 --> 35:41.013
I'm sorry, we should
have caught it earlier.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.306
So

35:42.599 --> 35:46.811
it's not just the latest
white count that's
leading you to feel this...

35:49.981 --> 35:51.732
I know this is scary.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.944
But a bone marrow transplant
could cure you.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.363
A marrow transplant
could kill me.

35:57.531 --> 36:00.616
The other option
is weekly blood transfusions,

36:00.992 --> 36:02.993
injections of GCSF.

36:03.912 --> 36:07.248
- It's a lifelong regimen.
- Yeah, I don't want that.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.791
You sure?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.087
I don't want to be cruel here,

36:13.213 --> 36:17.258
but you've jumped through
a lot of hoops to get
this sort of attention.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.219
I just want to be healthy.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.932
It's not so much fun
when you're actually sick.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.310
No.

36:32.357 --> 36:36.193
We'll check the registry.
See if there's a donor match.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.657
Thank you.

36:47.998 --> 36:51.417
We have to kill all the old
bone marrow before we give you
the new stuff.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.127
You'll have no immune system.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.337
We'll keep you
in a sterile room
for two weeks

36:55.463 --> 36:58.424
to make sure
everything's dead, then we'll
give you the donor marrow.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.719
It'll take
another couple weeks
until it takes hold.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.304
You won't feel a thing.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.682
If you get uncomfortable
for any reason
and need to talk, don't yell.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.310
Walls are
four inches thick, lead.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.771
Use the microphone.
Are you ready?

37:14.399 --> 37:15.274
Okay.

37:19.321 --> 37:20.946
Where's Dr. House?

38:11.915 --> 38:13.457
Turn it off!

38:14.793 --> 38:16.877
- Now what?
- How long has she been in there?

38:17.003 --> 38:18.337
Three minutes.
What's going on?

38:18.463 --> 38:20.673
She doesn't have
aplastic anemia.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.008
- She has an infection.
- No.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.095
Her white count
would be through the roof.
Hers is on the floor.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.972
Well, body does crazy things.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.933
"Body does crazy things."
That explains everything!

38:31.059 --> 38:32.142
She had no fever.

38:32.268 --> 38:35.479
'Cause her self-inflicted
Cushing's suppressed
her immune system.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.524
Stopped her
from having a fever,
hid the infection.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.070
Clostridium perfringens
could cause the bruises,

38:43.196 --> 38:44.196
the schistocytes, the anemia.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.824
Explains everything
except the white count.

38:47.117 --> 38:50.786
Augmentin is a lot safer than
destroying her immune system.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.246
Why don't we try that?

38:55.583 --> 38:58.711
You're taking the safe course?
What's going on?

39:00.171 --> 39:02.756
There's lots of explanations
for a low white count.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.217
Name one that fits her case.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.347
Colchicine.

39:14.894 --> 39:19.148
I figure that she'd
gotten her hands on it
and self-medicated.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.817
That's brilliant of her.

39:23.278 --> 39:26.947
Take the exact medication
that would confirm
your diagnosis.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.200
People do crazy things.

39:30.326 --> 39:33.287
You injected her
against her will
just so you could be right?

39:33.413 --> 39:35.622
- She consented.
- She's mentally ill!

39:35.749 --> 39:37.833
But she smells oh-so-sweet.

39:40.587 --> 39:43.338
She would've gotten sicker
when I said
she was gonna get sicker

39:43.465 --> 39:45.049
except Cameron
dosed her with antibiotics.

39:45.175 --> 39:47.134
- Just hold this.
- Is everything okay?

39:47.260 --> 39:48.719
Pull my finger.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.349
Grapey.

39:54.976 --> 39:57.144
You have a bacterium.
It's on all of us.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.939
But the bruises you gave
yourself with the Cushing's
made a lovely home.

40:01.357 --> 40:04.276
Bacteria moved in,
parked their cars on the lawn.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.903
There goes the neighborhood.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.530
By neighborhood, I mean,
your internal organs.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.992
So, should we put her
on the Augmentin, boss?

40:12.118 --> 40:14.203
Or do you think
she injected herself
with grapes?

40:16.873 --> 40:19.166
I love the smell of pus
in the morning.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.252
Smells like... victory.

40:27.550 --> 40:31.428
If you were serious
about the offer,
I'm serious about accepting.

40:32.639 --> 40:37.142
I'd like to run the
department. And you said it
yourself, things run smooth.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.395
Except for the part
where House went
behind your back

40:40.522 --> 40:43.774
and KO'd the patient
with insulin and colchicine.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.276
There was no reason
to suspect an infection.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.821
Even House didn't think
it was an infection.

40:49.239 --> 40:50.823
You would have done
the same thing I did.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.825
And I'd be just as wrong.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.453
What House did was insane.
But he saved her life.

40:56.579 --> 40:57.412
He got lucky.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.414
He got her to admit
she's got a problem.

40:59.541 --> 41:03.168
She's agreed to
outpatient treatment.
He gets lucky a lot.

41:08.216 --> 41:10.759
Did you ever really intend
to give me this job,

41:10.885 --> 41:13.470
or were you just trying
to stop me
from stepping down?

41:13.596 --> 41:16.223
Well, you've got
two more weeks in charge.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.434
Hopefully the next case
will go better.

41:25.942 --> 41:29.695
She should've died.
House is not a hero.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.532
A person who has the guts
to break a bad rule,

41:33.783 --> 41:35.492
they're a hero.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.203
House doesn't break rules,
he ignores them.

41:38.621 --> 41:42.166
He's not Rosa Parks,
he's an anarchist.

41:43.126 --> 41:46.378
All he stands for is the right
for everyone to grab
whatever they want

41:46.504 --> 41:48.172
whenever they want.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.465
You tell doctors that's okay,

41:51.009 --> 41:54.386
your mortality rate
is gonna go through the roof.

41:58.308 --> 42:01.476
Kind of digging
this whole
Foreman-in-charge thing.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.770
Give me those.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.691
Frees me up to watch my soaps,

42:08.193 --> 42:11.153
catch a movie
in the afternoon,
have lunch with you.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.280
Yeah, that's
a big change for you.

42:13.406 --> 42:16.450
Now Cuddy's
on Foreman's ass, not mine.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.251
You couldn't live with Foreman
as your boss.

42:26.419 --> 42:27.711
Why not?

42:28.463 --> 42:30.631
People can change, you know.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.311
Your white count is way down.

42:44.437 --> 42:46.730
We're going to need
to admit you,
just to run a few more tests.

42:46.856 --> 42:48.941
Whatever you think is best.

42:59.535 --> 43:02.287
Last race at Belmont.
Put it all on the five

43:02.413 --> 43:03.622
to win.
