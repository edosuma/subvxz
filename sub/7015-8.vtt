WEBVTT

00:03.534 --> 00:07.306
hey, thanks for coming down to meet my sister, man.
I had dinner with her and my dad last night,

00:07.383 --> 00:12.244
it was the first family dinner I had ever been to where
we didn't have to sneak out of the restaurant one at a time.

00:12.631 --> 00:15.390
Man, hyde, first a new dad,
now a new sister--

00:15.426 --> 00:18.126
it's like you hit
the orphan lottery.

00:18.608 --> 00:22.142
Look, your dad's got a whole jar
of peppermint patties.

00:22.994 --> 00:24.685
That's class, baby.

00:25.695 --> 00:29.241
That's nothing, you guys. I found
20 bucks just sitting on the desk,

00:29.276 --> 00:31.152
and I kind of
wanna steal it.

00:31.552 --> 00:34.910
Wow, I'm really starting to see
the underbelly of not having a job.

00:35.215 --> 00:38.653
Check it out, hyde--
your dad knows Skynyrd.

00:38.680 --> 00:43.910
I heard when you first meet them, if you just yell
"free bird" really loud, they'll start playing it.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.210
Ah, angie, meet your
new brother's friends--

00:48.250 --> 00:50.980
they're scruffy, but they
don't seem to be dangerous.

00:51.105 --> 00:52.831
Hey, guys,
check it out-

00:53.019 --> 00:54.745
family 'fro.

00:56.175 --> 00:57.537
I know what
you're thinking.

00:57.561 --> 01:01.870
What are the odds that steven would have
a previously unknown black half-sister?

01:01.917 --> 01:05.930
Well, I'll tell you--
2,437 to 1.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.750
I'm a math major.

01:08.255 --> 01:12.153
A math major? Awesome. I need
some help building a homemade rocket,

01:12.679 --> 01:17.728
and we also need a hamster that's
not afraid of heights or being blown up.

01:18.738 --> 01:22.621
- You must be kelso.
- Yeah, I am.

01:23.609 --> 01:28.842
Boy, am I glad you showed up. It's a lot of pressure
being the only good-looking one in the room.

01:28.903 --> 01:30.946
Michael, that
is so rude.

01:30.981 --> 01:32.787
You know there's two of us.

01:33.585 --> 01:35.769
And that makes
you Jackie.

01:35.793 --> 01:38.282
That's right. Hi.

01:38.746 --> 01:41.733
Okay, so let me bring you
up to speed on the group.

01:41.780 --> 01:46.148
Too skinny, too tall, too horny,
too foreign, too-riffic.

01:47.111 --> 01:50.613
Look at this-- my two kids
together and getting along.

01:50.742 --> 01:53.243
That's it, 20 bucks
for everybody.

01:55.016 --> 01:57.482
It's okay. I
already got mine.

01:58.656 --> 02:00.835
I took it off
your desk.

02:01.739 --> 02:03.970
I'm at a really weird
place in my life.

02:07.431 --> 02:10.881

02:42.740 --> 02:43.707
Hey, man.

02:43.754 --> 02:45.701
Hey, I brought
everyone cupcakes.

02:45.741 --> 02:47.447
- Cool!
- Cupcakes!

02:48.594 --> 02:53.513
Here's a special one for you-- vanilla on
the outside and chocolate on the inside.

02:57.926 --> 03:00.406
what are you doing? You knew
I was gonna take that one.

03:00.460 --> 03:02.393
Oh, well, too late.

03:03.153 --> 03:05.166
You're always doing that.

03:05.206 --> 03:07.753
That is the reason
why we broke up.

03:07.993 --> 03:11.503
We broke up because you
were always cheating on me.

03:12.703 --> 03:15.077
That and the cupcake thing.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.345
So this is where
you hang out, huh?

03:20.956 --> 03:23.680
Do the people who own this
place know we're down here?

03:23.974 --> 03:25.782
Yeah, they kind of adopted me.

03:25.876 --> 03:29.584
You don't know this about me,
but I've had, like, 13 dads.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.533
You know, I don't know
so much about you.

03:31.568 --> 03:34.516
I mean, like, what kind of stuff
did you do growing up?

03:34.551 --> 03:35.889
Did you play sports?

03:35.932 --> 03:38.868
Well, I used to play this
one game called stoop.

03:39.079 --> 03:41.134
What you do is
you sit on a stoop

03:41.157 --> 03:43.646
and you chuck things
at passersby.

03:45.149 --> 03:46.629
I was a pro.

03:47.448 --> 03:49.409
I was a passerby.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.681
Did you know that I am a shampoo
boy down at the beauty salon?

03:55.265 --> 03:56.416
Yes,

03:56.616 --> 04:00.913
ladies come from miles around
to be touched by these magic hands.

04:02.076 --> 04:05.187
Is that why they're
all dry and chapped?

04:05.869 --> 04:06.891
No.

04:10.049 --> 04:11.834
That's from
my day off.

04:14.265 --> 04:17.711
So, angie, are you excited about your
first day at work at dad's office tomorrow?

04:17.733 --> 04:21.423
Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.
I mean, it's my first job out of college.

04:21.456 --> 04:24.040
Oh, believe me, this is
the easiest job I've ever had.

04:24.076 --> 04:30.627
Wait. What about the time you got paid 2 bucks to eat everything
out of forman's fridge and then you threw it up all over the place?

04:32.259 --> 04:33.645
That was you.

04:35.007 --> 04:36.263
Oh, yeah.

04:37.848 --> 04:39.677
That was awesome.

04:42.906 --> 04:44.867
So it's cool if we
slack off at work.

04:44.914 --> 04:48.172
Look, any time I even think about
work, I remember one thing--

04:48.207 --> 04:49.815
I'm the
boss's son,

04:49.851 --> 04:53.279
then I head down to the nearest
bar to chug beer and play darts.

04:53.326 --> 04:57.894
Ah, beer and darts-- keeping the eye
patch industry alive since the 1800s.

05:03.842 --> 05:04.887
Kitty,

05:06.061 --> 05:09.079
you told me we were going
to the hardware store.

05:11.226 --> 05:15.499
And you told me I'd have a fur coat
by winter. People say a lot of things.

05:18.447 --> 05:21.548
But this is no
place for a man.

05:25.012 --> 05:29.321
But it's 25 ladies and me.
I think I like my chances.

05:30.973 --> 05:32.699
Kitty, I gotta
get out of here.

05:33.016 --> 05:37.666
One of these ladies is likely to come
over here and try to talk me into a toupee.

05:40.191 --> 05:41.729
Okay, Fez...

05:43.922 --> 05:45.683
give me
the gossip.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.501
Is that glitter
in your hair?

05:48.947 --> 05:51.272
Are you making
me a piÑata?

05:52.552 --> 05:57.745
No. I was working on a new outfit
for eric to wear at the roller disco.

06:00.328 --> 06:03.299
Roller disco? Eric is
into roller disco?

06:03.336 --> 06:04.557
Uh-oh.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.970
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to reschedule 'cause
I have to go spread this embarrassing news.

06:10.134 --> 06:13.328
You can't tell anyone.
I promised eric I'd keep it a secret.

06:13.361 --> 06:16.156
Besides, you used to
roller disco with jackie.

06:16.191 --> 06:18.692
Sure, when I
was a child,

06:18.891 --> 06:20.559
but I'm a man now.

06:20.897 --> 06:23.409
I moved on to
robot dancing.

06:29.314 --> 06:30.593
Hey, you wanted to see me?

06:30.629 --> 06:32.225
Have a seat, steven.

06:32.355 --> 06:36.910
It's  come to my attention you've been
sneaking off from work to go play darts.

06:38.390 --> 06:43.630
Well, in my defense, it's just something to do
to pass the time while I'm drinking beer.

06:45.602 --> 06:47.939
Yes, Angie
mentioned that, too.

06:47.974 --> 06:48.925
What?

06:49.533 --> 06:52.633
You ratted me out on my
midday dart-and-booze?

06:52.680 --> 06:56.130
What? No, I just thought
it was a funny story.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.807
Steven, I'm so sorry.
Daddy, please don't fire him.

06:58.842 --> 07:00.192
I'm not gonna fire him.

07:00.256 --> 07:02.093
You're not?
I mean...

07:02.129 --> 07:04.594
you're not--
excellent choice.

07:06.626 --> 07:07.786
S teven,

07:07.821 --> 07:10.862
you may be the boss' son, but you
still have to show up and do some work.

07:10.898 --> 07:15.066
Come on, man, even you said yourself it
was fine if I slack off every now and then.

07:15.098 --> 07:18.680
Look, I want you to succeed here,
Steven, so no more darts.

07:18.779 --> 07:19.766
Fine.

07:20.961 --> 07:24.167
Oh, but can I start
succeeding next week?

07:26.092 --> 07:29.826
See, there's a tournament tomorrow.
I'm already signed up and everything.

07:33.842 --> 07:36.319
There's my little
roller disco king.

07:36.354 --> 07:37.352
Mom !

07:38.421 --> 07:43.157
Look, at any given moment, there at least three kids in
this house who would use that information to destroy me.

07:43.650 --> 07:45.411
We have to keep
it our secret.

07:45.470 --> 07:46.350
Well,

07:46.843 --> 07:49.744
I was just
reading the bible,

07:51.329 --> 07:55.016
and it says that keeping
secrets is a sin.

07:55.157 --> 07:59.936
It goes lust, gluttony,
sloth, keeping secrets.

08:00.887 --> 08:03.118
Mom, we don't even
have a bible.

08:03.494 --> 08:07.322
Remember last christmas you spilled
peppermint schnapps all over it?

08:11.373 --> 08:14.167
Honey, just share
your secret.

08:14.226 --> 08:17.385
People are gonna find out
eventually because

08:17.678 --> 08:22.246
that is a surprisingly difficult
thing to keep secret.

08:23.161 --> 08:25.225
Okay, I don't know
if you know this about me,

08:25.274 --> 08:29.161
but I already take quite a bit of crap just
walking around being regular me, so,

08:29.196 --> 08:31.462
No, I'm not gonna
tell anybody.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.818
Do you want me
to tell them?

08:35.558 --> 08:37.201
- No.
- Yes?

08:40.788 --> 08:41.974
No.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.485
I'll think about
it, okay?

08:45.508 --> 08:48.350
Maybe there's a way I can
kind of feel everybody out.

08:48.643 --> 08:49.676
Good.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.938
and by the way,

08:54.068 --> 08:57.461
I did not spill peppermints
chnapps on the bible.

08:57.848 --> 09:01.265
It was sambuca.
I am not trailer trash.

09:06.819 --> 09:09.719
I know something
you don't know.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.344
Fez, you know a lot
of things I don't know,

09:13.570 --> 09:16.710
mostly because they're disgusting
and I don't wanna know them.

09:17.570 --> 09:18.580
True,

09:19.030 --> 09:20.690
but this is
about eric.

09:20.893 --> 09:24.190
What do you think he's doing every
wednesday night when he's not with you?

09:25.834 --> 09:28.699
He's taking an at-home
spanish course.

09:31.235 --> 09:34.466
He doesn't wanna be disturbed,
so he locks himself in his room.

09:34.771 --> 09:38.247
You know, I think he's self-conscious
because he can't roll his "R"s.

09:38.822 --> 09:40.346
Oh, believe me, donna,

09:40.393 --> 09:42.941
he is rolling his ass off.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.734
Okay, fez,
what's going on?

09:47.098 --> 09:49.010
Is there another woman?

09:49.045 --> 09:50.078
Yes...

09:51.100 --> 09:53.002
and it's eric.

09:58.513 --> 10:00.545
Angie totally set
me up, man.

10:00.580 --> 10:03.574
I should have seen this coming when
I found out she was a math major.

10:04.643 --> 10:06.791
Those girls are
always bitches.

10:08.189 --> 10:10.068
You know what
your problem is, hyde?

10:10.338 --> 10:12.463
I'm too good-looking.

10:14.776 --> 10:17.383
Who does angie think
she is, anyway?

10:17.418 --> 10:20.906
She can't just walk in here and pull your
strings like you're some kind of puppet.

10:20.942 --> 10:22.703
That's my job.

10:23.184 --> 10:26.390
Hey, guys, just to jump
off topic here for a sec,

10:26.425 --> 10:29.067
when you're dancing to say,like,

10:29.125 --> 10:30.815
Donna Summer,
whoever,

10:31.825 --> 10:34.091
do you ever wish that
you were on wheels?

10:35.442 --> 10:36.475
Forman,

10:36.930 --> 10:40.641
so many parts of what you just said
make me wanna kick your ass.

10:41.345 --> 10:42.332
Eric,

10:42.402 --> 10:44.093
you know what
your problem is?

10:44.187 --> 10:45.995
I'm too good-looking.

10:46.948 --> 10:53.030
Okay, it's wednesday night, so you guys know what
that means-- off to my room for a little espaÑol,

10:53.077 --> 10:56.893
or should I say off
to my room-o?

11:01.621 --> 11:03.394
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.719
All right, back
off, hyde.

11:05.755 --> 11:07.657
She's here for me.

11:13.096 --> 11:14.681
Hey, mama.

11:14.728 --> 11:17.734
Hey, so what the hell
was that all about today?

11:18.638 --> 11:19.890
Look,

11:19.936 --> 11:24.152
my dad said that if I did well in college,
some day the business would be mine,

11:24.175 --> 11:25.648
and I did my part,

11:25.683 --> 11:30.215
so there's no way I'm gonna share everything
with some frizzy-haired kid fresh out of juvie.

11:30.262 --> 11:35.042
Okay, I'm working at that company
because our dad wants me there,

11:35.078 --> 11:37.344
and don't insult me
with that juvie crap.

11:37.379 --> 11:40.902
I'm over 18. If I get pinched,
I'm doing big boy time.

11:41.819 --> 11:45.635
Running this company is my dream,
so if you don't quit tomorrow,

11:45.682 --> 11:47.173
it's gonna be war.

11:48.688 --> 11:50.602
He's your friend. Talk
some sense into him.

11:50.637 --> 11:54.347
If you wanted my help, you should
have brought more cupcakes.

12:05.431 --> 12:08.451
Fez, come on. Just tell
us what eric's up to.

12:08.486 --> 12:12.267
Donna, if I learned anything
from all my years as a virgin,

12:14.239 --> 12:17.789
it's that seeing it is much
better than talking about it.

12:46.890 --> 12:49.366
what the hell
was that?

12:51.726 --> 12:53.135
That, donna,

12:53.170 --> 12:55.119
that's what's left
of your boyfriend.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.637
So, steven, what are you
gonna do about angie?

13:02.689 --> 13:04.462
How are you
gonna fight back?

13:04.591 --> 13:05.941
I  don't know that I am.

13:05.976 --> 13:09.088
I mean, you're asking me
to fight for a job.

13:10.272 --> 13:12.010
That's a tough sell.

13:12.773 --> 13:15.203
But this is my
company at stake.

13:15.685 --> 13:18.914
Jackie, would you stop saying
that everything that's mine is yours?

13:19.231 --> 13:24.768
Okay, steven, last valentine's day I gave you
a card that said "be mine," and you said yes.

13:26.635 --> 13:28.420
And by saying yes,

13:28.455 --> 13:34.511
you agreed that everything you had, have or will
have from now until the end of time is mine as well.

13:35.627 --> 13:38.081
Read the fine
print, steven.

13:38.868 --> 13:43.255
This whole work thing is a mess. I
miss my glory days of being an orphan.

13:44.394 --> 13:47.247
A little piece of advice
about having a family--

13:47.282 --> 13:49.985
get used to being
screwed over.

13:50.619 --> 13:53.496
Well, that's a very
cynical view of family.

13:53.543 --> 13:54.400
Oh, yeah,

13:54.576 --> 13:57.394
and you and your sister
get along so well.

13:57.429 --> 14:00.887
Oh, I talked to a lawyer.
She's not getting a damn thing.

14:06.782 --> 14:09.130
Red, we have
something to tell you.

14:09.377 --> 14:10.963
It's pretty shocking.

14:11.162 --> 14:13.100
I'm not sure how
to break it to you.

14:13.170 --> 14:15.706
Okay, you'd better
let me handle this.

14:15.894 --> 14:16.974
All right,

14:17.749 --> 14:20.259
Everybody whose son

14:20.295 --> 14:24.557
is not a roller disco-er, take one
step forward. Not so fast, red.

14:32.092 --> 14:33.971
Someone's been working
on their spin, susie.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.014
Nice, very nice.

14:41.257 --> 14:42.619
It's magic time.

14:45.132 --> 14:49.511
Hey, everybody, let's give a great
bigroller palace welcome to the one,

14:49.558 --> 14:53.034
the only rainbow!

15:25.144 --> 15:27.458
nice shorts, rainbow.

15:35.715 --> 15:36.807
Hey,

15:36.854 --> 15:39.402
did you come up
to pack up your office?

15:39.449 --> 15:42.232
Listen, sis, about
the whole job thing,

15:42.478 --> 15:46.867
I thought about going head-to-head with you,
but I decided I just can't stoop to your level.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.323
Well, good.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.178
But she can.

15:54.356 --> 15:57.056
Right now she's telling
everybody we work with

15:57.091 --> 15:59.909
that you stripped your
way through college.

16:02.563 --> 16:05.396
Please, like anybody's
gonna believe her.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.899
My dad's rich.

16:06.935 --> 16:09.788
Oh, no, no, no. You didn't strip
because you needed the money.

16:09.823 --> 16:12.218
Word around the
water cooler is

16:13.029 --> 16:15.762
you stripped
because you liked it.

16:15.798 --> 16:18.733
Yeah, I know, I know.
What a whore.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.608
Stop laughing at me.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.717
I am not a stripper.
I am a math major.

16:27.008 --> 16:28.018
Jackie,

16:28.546 --> 16:32.019
if there was ever a game show
called "make that girl cry,"

16:33.146 --> 16:34.732
I'd go on with you.

16:35.894 --> 16:37.960
Oh, we'd so
win the car.

16:43.684 --> 16:46.603
all right, everybody
clear some space.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.603
It's rainbow!

16:53.194 --> 16:55.624
Now look, eric,
they love you,

16:55.660 --> 16:58.286
so it's a good
thing I told fez.

17:00.247 --> 17:02.889
I didn't tell you
I told fez.

17:03.511 --> 17:05.390
I didn't tell fez.

17:07.338 --> 17:09.123
Eric, how did
this happen?

17:09.157 --> 17:14.736
I mean, you don't just wake up one morning, throw on
some skates, and start doing cartwheels to sister sledge.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.247
It all started when I went down
to the sporting goods store.

17:18.292 --> 17:22.603
I saw this pair of roller skates,
and when I tried them on,

17:22.650 --> 17:26.359
well, it was like the first time
Joe Namath laid his hands on a bat.

17:29.552 --> 17:32.299
The next thing I can
remember is spinning,

17:32.346 --> 17:35.775
just spinning and
spinning and spinning.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.284
When I finally stopped,
I found myself at the park.

17:39.942 --> 17:42.161
That's where I met
up with these people.

17:43.253 --> 17:47.140
Wait, those skate freaks that hang
out down by the basketball court?

17:47.187 --> 17:51.392
Every time we wanna shoot hoops, we
gotta scare them off with bottle rockets.

17:51.556 --> 17:54.233
Kelso, they're not freaks.
They're just like you and me,

17:54.268 --> 17:56.276
but on wheels.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.039
Eric,

17:59.097 --> 18:01.047
let me tell you
a little story.

18:02.185 --> 18:06.941
When I was a boy, there was a kid
who wanted to be a ballet dancer,

18:06.988 --> 18:09.176
and all the other kids
made fun of him.

18:09.834 --> 18:14.319
But years later when he came back
to town, he had achieved his dream--

18:14.354 --> 18:16.034
he was a dancer

18:16.081 --> 18:18.511
with the New York City Ballet.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.410
And you know
what happened?

18:20.563 --> 18:24.132
You learned your little lesson
about judging people unfairly, huh?

18:24.811 --> 18:29.097
No, a bunch of guys got together
and beat the crap out of him.

18:33.639 --> 18:34.707
Hey, red,

18:35.212 --> 18:37.044
you know what
your problem is?

18:37.091 --> 18:39.392
I'm too good-looking.

18:45.300 --> 18:48.306
Okay, dad, I hear
what you're saying,

18:48.964 --> 18:51.817
but I honestly don't
know if I can give it up.

18:52.463 --> 18:54.412
Why don't you try
something else?

18:54.459 --> 18:57.335
I suggest robot dancing.

19:00.423 --> 19:02.971
feel the beat.
Disco robot.

19:05.495 --> 19:06.688
Daddy,

19:06.724 --> 19:08.955
I can't work with him.
He's telling lies about me.

19:08.978 --> 19:10.692
Actually, that's not true.

19:11.315 --> 19:13.170
She's telling them.

19:16.932 --> 19:19.304
Steven, why is that girl
always in the office?

19:19.339 --> 19:23.507
And why has she been passing out
dress code memos to my employees?

19:24.306 --> 19:25.809
Hum... Well,

19:25.844 --> 19:29.564
she's against the casualization
of the workplace.

19:30.163 --> 19:32.593
She doesn't belong here,
and neither does he.

19:32.628 --> 19:34.495
I can't believe
what I'm seeing--

19:34.530 --> 19:37.021
a brother and sister
fighting each other.

19:37.233 --> 19:39.029
Hey, we are a family.

19:39.863 --> 19:44.418
Look, if you want him to stay, that's fine.
But if he stays, I'm out of here.

19:44.900 --> 19:49.723
Well, that's too bad, because I'm opening up a new
record store and I wanted the two of you to run it,

19:49.770 --> 19:52.646
but  maybe I'll just let
Steven run it by himself.

19:52.681 --> 19:54.607
Hell yeah!

19:59.008 --> 20:00.969
Nice going, sis.

20:01.956 --> 20:04.797
No. You know I've always
wanted my own store.

20:04.821 --> 20:06.335
Well, if you two can't find
a way to work this out--

20:06.366 --> 20:09.701
We can. I know we can.
He's my brother.

20:09.736 --> 20:14.638
I tried to get him fired, he calls
me a stripper-- this is how we play.

20:15.786 --> 20:19.238
Well, I'm glad, because
if this kept going,

20:19.262 --> 20:23.401
I would have had to send the two of you
to your offices without any dinner.

20:24.199 --> 20:26.771
That's a bad joke.
I love it.

20:29.412 --> 20:30.580
So

20:30.603 --> 20:33.186
looks like you're gonna have
to put up with me after all.

20:33.222 --> 20:36.791
Hey, I said I'd work with you.
It doesn't mean I like you.

20:36.850 --> 20:40.431
You not liking me doesn't bother me
that much now that I won.

20:41.647 --> 20:43.127
And by "I won,"

20:43.162 --> 20:45.123
I mean you lost.

20:45.710 --> 20:47.530
Oh, and also...

21:04.229 --> 21:07.282
you know, here I'm
just an average kid,

21:07.505 --> 21:09.172
but down there...

21:10.065 --> 21:12.848
down there I was a star.

21:22.077 --> 21:23.006
what?

21:24.145 --> 21:26.223
Oh, did I make the kissy
face too early again?

21:26.270 --> 21:28.665
No, no, it's nothing.

21:32.174 --> 21:33.477
What?

21:36.882 --> 21:39.066
Why do you keep
laughing at me?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.168
I'm gonna go home

21:41.215 --> 21:45.425
and I'm gonna watch a really sad movie
and I'm gonna try to come back later.
