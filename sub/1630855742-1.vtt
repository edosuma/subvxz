01:53.739 --> 01:58.035
<i>Journalist,
author and a vital force for change,</i>

01:58.035 --> 02:01.580
<i>Alex Levy will forever
be remembered as an icon.</i>

02:02.122 --> 02:07.044
<i>From her many years on</i> The Morning Show
<i>to her Emmy-winning hit</i> Alex Unfiltered<i>,</i>

02:07.044 --> 02:10.797
<i>Alex brought us closer to the world
and to each other.</i>

02:11.298 --> 02:14.384
You've all meant a lot
to me over the years,

02:15.052 --> 02:19.223
<i>and I want to thank you for that
from the bottom of my heart.</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:27.731
I look too perky.
Don't you think I look too perky?

02:27.731 --> 02:30.108
Like, "Oh, my God. She's dead."

02:30.108 --> 02:32.319
- Yeah. I'll find some alts.
- You agree, right?

02:32.319 --> 02:35.197
- Yeah.
- You guys, this obituary shit is morbid...

02:35.197 --> 02:36.406
- I know.
- ...and it is unnecessary.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.117
You're going up in a suborbital rocket
for, like, 13 minutes.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.827
You're not gonna have time
to finish your peanuts.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.371
I would not put it past Cory

02:42.371 --> 02:44.915
to blow me up on live TV just
for the ratings. Son of a bitch.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.376
But then what would he do for Sweeps Week?

02:48.669 --> 02:52.172
Guys, honestly, how maiden is this voyage?

02:52.172 --> 02:55.133
I mean, they do test these rockets, right?

02:55.133 --> 02:56.093
No, they don't test them.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.387
They just kinda staple them together
and blow 'em up into space.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.596
Of course, they test them, okay?

02:59.596 --> 03:01.473
You're going up with the guy
who built the thing.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.141
You don't think he wants
to come back in one piece?

03:03.141 --> 03:04.768
I hope so. I don't know.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.144
Oh, my God. Okay.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.940
The guy has multiple NASA contracts.
It is going to be fine, Alex.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.692
That's what they said to the crew
of the <i>Challenger</i>.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.610
- Oh, boy, here we go. Really?
- And Apollo 1.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.362
- Okay.
- And 13.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.823
Thirteen came back.
I mean, they had Tom Hanks, but still.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.661
Cory, it's Alex.
Why are you avoiding me? Question mark.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.079
Fucker.

03:24.079 --> 03:24.997
- Alex.
- Yes?

03:24.997 --> 03:26.790
- We're ready for you.
- Oh, God. Good.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.750
- Esther. Let's do Esther.
- Let's do it.

03:28.750 --> 03:33.172
I am joined today
by acclaimed psychotherapist Esther Perel,

03:33.172 --> 03:37.885
best-selling author, speaker and host
of the podcast <i>Where Should We Begin?</i>

03:38.886 --> 03:41.471
- So happy to have you here.
- Thank you. Pleasure to be here.

03:42.472 --> 03:46.560
So, two years after the world shut down

03:46.560 --> 03:49.938
and we are all just barely getting back
on our feet.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.608
Esther, you speak to a lot of couples.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.152
What is everybody feeling right now?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.025
Are you sneaking out of your own bed?

04:36.318 --> 04:37.653
I must be off my game.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.530
Sorry, I'm late.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.365
So, no lunch?

04:42.324 --> 04:43.700
I gotta go to work.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.494
You got anything to eat?

04:46.620 --> 04:47.829
Advil?

04:47.829 --> 04:50.123
You were more fun last night.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.918
I gotta be there soon.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.922
Okay.

04:56.922 --> 05:00.008
We haven't just had a physical lockdown.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.511
We are in an emotional lockdown,

05:02.511 --> 05:07.891
and we have been surviving
and now we are wanting to be thriving.

05:07.891 --> 05:13.397
But for that, we need to fully experience
the difference between not being dead

05:13.397 --> 05:15.649
and being actually alive.

05:16.275 --> 05:19.194
"Not being dead."
And how do we-- How do we do that?

05:19.194 --> 05:22.489
How do we get back to feeling alive?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.575
I don't even know what that looks like.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.493
It's different for every person.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.579
So let me ask you, Alex,

05:28.579 --> 05:34.251
how would you complete the sentence
"I feel most alive when..."?

05:34.751 --> 05:35.919
What would you say?

05:38.088 --> 05:40.299
- When I'm working on something...
- Right.

05:40.299 --> 05:43.093
...that I feel very passionate about,
I feel very alive.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.888
- Right. And you feel immersed and engaged...
- Yes.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.681
...and curious and present

05:47.681 --> 05:49.433
- and able to take risks.
- Right.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.352
So, my question to you is,
why only at work?

05:52.936 --> 05:56.064
I mean, when is the last time
that you allowed yourself

05:56.064 --> 06:00.569
that kind of immersion and intensity
but with another human being?

06:09.578 --> 06:10.704
Okay.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.335
<i>Are you sure this is safe?</i>

06:16.335 --> 06:18.337
<i>What if someone sees your story
and knows it's me?</i>

06:18.337 --> 06:21.840
No, please understand,
we will completely conceal your identity.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.051
I promise you no one will recognize you.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.845
But people have to know
what's going on in Texas, Luna.

06:26.845 --> 06:30.849
It's just, I can't express
how important it is right now.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.477
I have to go next week.
It's the only time I can get off work.

06:33.477 --> 06:36.063
No problem.
I'll see you in a few days, okay?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.482
Okay.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.538
- Bradley.
- Cory.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.414
How are you?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.000
I'm good. Yeah. Busy.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.503
You got the speech ready for tomorrow?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.089
Well, shitty first draft, but yes.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.216
Well,
we will all be there to cheer you on.

07:04.216 --> 07:07.177
- Great. I'm on in an hour.
- Right.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.387
- Yeah.
- Kill the people.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.471
Okay.

07:12.808 --> 07:16.019
Did you see the revised copy
on the flood in Australia?

07:16.019 --> 07:18.522
Yeah. Did we get a confirmation
on the death toll?

07:18.522 --> 07:22.609
Government says 21 dead at least, but they
finally declared a national emergency.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.694
That's confirmed?

07:23.694 --> 07:25.404
- Yeah.
- Okay. Got it. Thank you.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.739
- Good evening, everyone.
- Hey, Bradley.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.658
- Let's have a great show.
- Good evening.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.785
- Sound check?
- Ten seconds, guys.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.954
Three, two, one.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.330
Can you hear me?

07:35.330 --> 07:36.540
Yes. I can hear you, Gayle.

07:36.540 --> 07:40.169
- Okay, clear. Four, three, two.
- Have a good show.

07:41.420 --> 07:45.007
Welcome to the <i>UBA Evening News</i>.
I'm Bradley Jackson.

07:45.841 --> 07:49.595
President Biden spoke
with Chinese President Xi Jinping today

07:49.595 --> 07:54.766
as the US navigates China's ties to Russia
amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.112
Too hot?

08:07.613 --> 08:11.074
- Nope. What doesn't kill you...
- Almost kills you.

08:12.910 --> 08:15.412
I was solo climbing on Annapurna
a few years back.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.123
Oxygen tank failed.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.752
Weather rolled in, should've buried me.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.463
Wait, don't tell me. You survived?

08:25.422 --> 08:28.008
Came across these other climbers,
they had a spare tank.

08:28.008 --> 08:32.011
They gave me their spare tank.
I put their kids through college.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.222
Well, fuck yes. That's a good story.

08:34.222 --> 08:39.436
That's people who need people,
and that could be us, Paul. You and me.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.523
You got to admit,
it would make a great press release.

08:42.523 --> 08:46.276
While everyone was doomscrolling
under the covers during COVID,

08:46.276 --> 08:50.280
two guys, they cross paths
at high tide in the Hamptons

08:50.280 --> 08:53.075
to forge the biggest media deal
in a decade.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.078
So now you're thirsty?

08:56.078 --> 08:58.330
Well, I literally am thirsty. Yeah.

08:58.330 --> 09:02.501
But, hey, my kimono is open.
So are my pores. Where are we on this?

09:02.501 --> 09:03.836
What do you mean? I'm ready to close.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.379
You're the one
that's holding this thing up.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.089
It's time to either dance or fuck off.

09:07.089 --> 09:09.508
Well, meet my price.
I'm ready to go to the prom.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.885
- I wanna wear my crown.
- Your number's inflated.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.304
Says the fucking rich guy.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.765
UBA's on the bubble. COVID saved your ass,

09:16.765 --> 09:20.018
and I am offering a 20% premium
on top of market value,

09:20.018 --> 09:21.395
and you're lucky to get that.

09:21.395 --> 09:26.567
You are lucky to get me 'cause I built
a goddamn pyramid during a pandemic.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.151
That's undeniable, and so am I.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.905
You started a streaming platform
at the beginning of a global lockdown.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.198
Care to speculate what might happen

09:33.198 --> 09:35.158
when the world decides it's time
to get back to business?

09:35.158 --> 09:38.453
Well, I'm starting with launching
the first female journalist into space.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.623
- Haven't you heard?
- I'm launching her. It's my rocket.

09:41.623 --> 09:42.958
She's my journalist.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.085
Come on. Think about it.

09:45.085 --> 09:49.381
You got America's sweetheart
on the maiden voyage of <i>Hyperion One</i>.

09:49.381 --> 09:52.467
She's gonna make space
as safe and appealing

09:52.467 --> 09:54.720
as a warm Cinnabon and a cup of Folgers.

09:55.846 --> 09:58.682
What is it-- What is this Alex Levy magic?

09:58.682 --> 10:00.017
Can you explain this to me?

10:00.017 --> 10:05.272
She's a survivor. That's it. And that's
what people want to see right now.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.774
I mean, she got the broken marriage,

10:07.774 --> 10:09.484
she got the predation
of the creepy coanchor,

10:09.484 --> 10:14.907
and then she suffers through a biblical
plague on live TV to become the one human

10:14.907 --> 10:20.412
that people can actually relate to in this
shit show of a so-called democracy.

10:20.412 --> 10:24.666
I did not discover Alex,
but I did bring her back from the dead.

10:25.667 --> 10:29.171
So, to your question,
Alex Levy is Lazarus,

10:29.171 --> 10:31.757
and that makes me Jesus.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.426
Except I'm in more houses
seven days a week.

10:34.426 --> 10:38.514
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesus,
but here's your problem.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.518
You're overleveraged.
No more loaves and fishes for you.

10:42.518 --> 10:46.605
You need a miracle, and, buddy, I'm it.

10:51.235 --> 10:55.197
And tomorrow morning, we will watch
Alex Levy as she continues training

10:55.197 --> 11:00.285
for next week's historic journey
on the maiden voyage of <i>Hyperion One</i>.

11:00.869 --> 11:04.915
Alex and Hyperion founder, Paul Marks,
will reach the edge of space

11:04.915 --> 11:09.086
on Wednesday, March 16th
live on <i>The Morning Show</i>.

11:09.586 --> 11:14.967
It's all a part of celebrating
Alex's two incredible decades here at UBA.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.644
I know.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.688
We've got to stop waking up this early.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.233
It's the absolute worst. It's awful.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.206
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey. Morning, Alex.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.627
<i>Yeah. Well, the race is the fun part.</i>

11:50.627 --> 11:53.255
- It's the training that sucks.
- Yeah.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.548
You're living at the gym.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.258
- Uh-huh.
- There's no social life, no vacay...

11:56.258 --> 11:58.135
- Right, yeah.
- ...no bacon.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.511
- Wait, did you say, "No bacon"?
- No.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.596
- Like what-- Like ever? No--
- No.

12:00.596 --> 12:03.432
I lost a race after a grand slam breakfast
at Denny's.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.600
Never again.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.977
Well, I don't know
if that's the bacon's fault.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.562
- Camera two, stay with Chris.
- Alex!

12:08.562 --> 12:10.063
Take camera two.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.648
The worst part about training

12:11.648 --> 12:13.692
- is that you're never in the mood.
- Oh, well.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.403
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah. You're too tired. Sore.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.571
- Dehydrated.
- Okay.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.489
- Okay. Very clear.
- Yeah, all right. Cringe. We g-- Got it.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.366
- We get it. Thank you.
- You know what I mean.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.493
- Okay. Well, that's a perfect segue...
- We're moving on. Moving on.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.621
- No, it's a horrible segue.
- ...but we're gonna roll with it.

12:25.621 --> 12:28.665
- Yes. Oh, my God.
- And speaking of rolling, the space chair.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.250
- There she is.
- Center up Alex.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.752
- Look at that.
- Take it, two.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.253
- Root canal flashbacks.
- Widen out. Wider.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.338
- My little baby.
- Wow.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.465
- Go, Jim.
- I've been training all week.

12:36.465 --> 12:37.799
I didn't know, but when you're in space,

12:37.799 --> 12:40.135
- you have to really use your core...
- Standby, camera three.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.845
...and just, kind of, like, tuck it--

12:43.096 --> 12:45.641
Miss Olympian, there we go.
Hello, gold medal.

12:45.641 --> 12:46.975
I like it.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.101
That's good. Just go with it.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.686
- Do you like it?
- I like it a lot.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.897
- Okay.
- Yeah. Houston, we're ready for liftoff.

12:51.897 --> 12:54.024
Listen, if you wanna trade places,

12:54.024 --> 12:58.111
I will gladly keep your anchor chair nice
and warm while you go orbit into space.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.363
Oh, no.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.032
- That one's starting to feel broken in.
- That's what I thought.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.159
- All right. Okay. While they do...
- Oh, God. I almost had her.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.786
- ...they-- musical chairs, Leigh...
- I almost had her.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.829
...can you tell us what the--
the weather's like for the launch?

13:07.829 --> 13:10.666
Yeah. Musical chairs is right, Yanko.
All right.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.085
- So, West Texas is gonna see clear skies
- Stay with her on one.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.254
and warm weather for the next few days.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.672
- So, Alex...
- Yes?

13:16.672 --> 13:18.549
...you'll have a great view
from that capsule.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.008
Yeah. Enjoy that.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.594
All right. Let's take a look here at...

13:22.594 --> 13:24.721
Can't possibly like each other that much.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.558
Don't be jealous.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.352
I'm not.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.855
I just wanna crush 'em.

13:32.855 --> 13:36.900
Hey, Lizzy. Mom. Remember me?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.527
I gave birth to you.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.030
Just checking in about Texas again.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.782
And I can still get you a ticket.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.243
I know you're very busy,
but if you wanna come...

13:47.327 --> 13:48.328
I love you.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.586
- There she is.
- Hey, stranger.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.171
- Hi.
- How's the new apartment?

13:57.171 --> 13:58.505
It's so good.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.007
Did you get that rug?

14:00.007 --> 14:01.425
Yes, I did, and you were right.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.677
- It looks fabulous.
- I can't wait to see it.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.304
- Yeah. Well, come over sometime.
- I know.

14:05.304 --> 14:07.097
I mean that you're the one
with the crazy schedule.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.099
Hello. Kettle.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.726
Okay. We're gonna make a plan.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.144
- Yep. Uh-huh.
- I have this machine.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.979
You push a button,
and a cappuccino comes out.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.355
No.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.648
- I have one of those.
- You do?

14:16.648 --> 14:18.317
Yes. I call it Chip.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.529
How is the training going? Is that crazy?

14:23.113 --> 14:24.823
Are you ready to defy gravity?

14:24.823 --> 14:27.534
My God. I've been trying
to defy gravity for 15 years.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.162
I'm nervous. Yeah, I'm nervous.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.330
You're gonna be great.

14:31.330 --> 14:34.875
Do you know I had to actually
cut together my own obit package?

14:34.875 --> 14:38.462
Literally, your whole life cut down
to 90 seconds to a Beach Boys cover.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.797
They won't pay
for an original Beach Boys song?

14:40.797 --> 14:43.509
No, there's budget cuts.

14:44.176 --> 14:46.178
Okay. Anyway, I'm coming over.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.679
- See you later.
- You better.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.724
- Hey. How you doin', Kyle?
- Alex!

14:50.724 --> 14:53.352
Look at that. The doctor is in. How nice.

14:53.352 --> 14:56.438
Hey. Rest and relaxation.
Check back in in two weeks.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.317
Hey, Cory, does your phone not work?

15:00.317 --> 15:01.985
Alex, I'm a little busy right now.

15:01.985 --> 15:05.781
Oh, come on. You know what? You said we
would finish our conversation last week,

15:05.781 --> 15:09.451
and here I am chasing you down.
Come on. Where's the love, Cory?

15:10.035 --> 15:11.286
Come on.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.288
I got you a ride on a spaceship.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.791
A chance to commune
with fragile planet Earth.

15:15.791 --> 15:19.586
David Attenborough would strangle
a snow leopard to have your seat.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.214
And good news, by the way,
I'm coming along with you.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.550
Paul just extended an invitation.

15:25.551 --> 15:28.595
Do I sense a little bromance
with Mr. Billionaire?

15:28.595 --> 15:31.473
Well, he likes me.
What can I tell you? Some people do.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.143
All right. I'm serious about this, Cory.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.771
I saved your precious UBA+ ass

15:37.771 --> 15:41.024
with my blood, my sweat and my tears
and everything else that came

15:41.024 --> 15:44.319
- out of my body when I had COVID.
- Alex, I'm profoundly grateful for all

15:44.319 --> 15:46.029
- of your bodily fluids, but--
- Okay.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.741
Well, let me then just speak Cory
for a second.

15:50.868 --> 15:54.413
How many ad dollars do you think
I have brought into this company

15:54.413 --> 15:56.164
in the 20 years that I've been here?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.459
Little tricky to estimate.

15:59.459 --> 16:03.964
Yeah. Well, I thought so. So that's why
I had Doug give it a whirl. It's about--

16:03.964 --> 16:05.299
about two billion.

16:06.550 --> 16:07.718
Doug.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.595
Well, agents do love a round number,
don't they?

16:09.595 --> 16:11.263
I need to be a real partner.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.683
I need to have a say
in the future of this place, okay?

16:14.683 --> 16:17.477
I've been out there
in the real world for the last two years,

16:17.477 --> 16:18.562
and I know what people want.

16:18.562 --> 16:21.148
Oh, come on. People don't know
what they want until we puree it,

16:21.148 --> 16:23.609
spoon it up and make airplane sounds.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.361
Okay. Well, here's what I want.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.071
Double my development slate,

16:28.739 --> 16:31.867
profit participation
and a seat on the board.

16:36.121 --> 16:39.458
- Alex.
- You know that it's time.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.418
I have earned this, Cory. Come on.

16:41.418 --> 16:47.674
Yeah.
What you are asking is unprecedented.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.594
I am unprecedented.

16:51.887 --> 16:55.390
I'm all over this network,
and I want to stay all over this network.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.351
But I will be very clear
with you right now.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.978
I'll go elsewhere, if things don't change.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.484
Alex, I hear you,

17:06.484 --> 17:10.196
and I'm going to make you very,
very happy.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.573
Don't fuck me on this, Cory.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.910
God, I'll kick your ass
out of that shuttle so fast,

17:14.910 --> 17:17.621
you'll be like Clooney in <i>Gravity</i>.
Just poof. Gone.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.248
See ya, Cory.

17:27.923 --> 17:28.924
Morning.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.676
Nice of you to join us.

17:31.343 --> 17:32.344
Space question.

17:32.845 --> 17:36.390
Massive star runs out of fuel,
can't support itself. What happens?

17:37.057 --> 17:38.141
Becomes a black hole.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.228
Hey. Nerd. Correct.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.273
Sorry I am late.
I was waylaid by our resident astronaut.

17:44.273 --> 17:49.278
So why am I getting angry calls
from all of our network division heads

17:49.278 --> 17:51.864
complaining about
your cost cutting measures?

17:51.864 --> 17:54.616
Have you ever had a happy call
from a network division head?

17:54.616 --> 17:59.454
You are cannibalizing the company
to feed UBA+ and drowning us in debt.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.373
No. It's really more of a misting,

18:01.373 --> 18:04.877
a gentle sprinkling to keep us cool
on a warm summer day.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.088
We can make it work
in the news division for now.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.257
But I want to sit down
and look at next quarter's projections

18:10.257 --> 18:12.217
because they're worse than we thought.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.011
And at some point
there's gonna be a mutiny.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.180
You know,
we can sit around counting beans or--

18:16.180 --> 18:18.891
But you know,
wouldn't it be more fun to plant them,

18:18.891 --> 18:22.436
grow a beanstalk
and turn UBA+ into a giant?

18:23.270 --> 18:24.271
The giant dies in the end.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.773
We hold the line.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.568
This is a rough patch.
We'll get through it,

18:29.568 --> 18:32.654
but we can't burn through
any more of our reserves.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.199
Stella, actually,
I wanna look over those numbers

18:35.199 --> 18:36.700
sometime this week.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.786
I need to manage
the expectations of the board.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.374
So, what did Alex want?

18:45.501 --> 18:47.169
Too much, as usual.

18:49.546 --> 18:53.091
I like to imagine Cybil on an ice floe
drifting away toward the horizon,

18:53.091 --> 18:54.635
getting smaller and smaller.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.012
She's right about one thing.
Our financials are shit.

18:57.513 --> 18:58.597
Do we need to talk about layoffs?

18:58.597 --> 19:00.265
Well,
don't fire up your LinkedIn just yet.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.434
- Where are you off to?
- Bradley.

19:04.061 --> 19:06.313
- And what does she want?
- Too much, as usual.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.277
With the jacket or without the jacket?

19:12.277 --> 19:13.570
Definitely jacket.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.072
- Come in.
- Hey.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.156
Hey.

19:17.074 --> 19:17.991
Nice dress.

19:18.617 --> 19:20.327
I don't know. Too much boob?

19:21.620 --> 19:23.163
No, not with the jacket.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.332
- Yeah. That's what I was thinking.
- Yeah.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.377
Could we just have just a minute?

19:28.377 --> 19:29.461
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thank you.

19:29.461 --> 19:30.671
Thanks.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.467
So, I'm guessing this is bad news.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.302
What is it?

19:38.345 --> 19:40.931
You're gonna have
to punt the abortion piece.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.349
- What?
- I'm sorry.

19:44.101 --> 19:47.229
Medical abortions skyrocketed
during the pandemic.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.022
The pills are the next front, Stella.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.400
We have to be leading this conversation.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.403
Yeah. We covered SB4 and SB8.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.989
And everybody knows
you're not neutral on this issue.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.074
Why? Because I have
a personal experience with it?

19:59.074 --> 20:01.535
That means I can't report on it?
That doesn't make any sense.

20:01.535 --> 20:04.037
Like-- Yanko is a gun owner.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.373
Does that mean he can't report
on school shootings?

20:06.373 --> 20:08.000
You know it's not the same thing.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.627
If you cross the line
and break local laws,

20:10.627 --> 20:14.882
you leave UBA open to a lawsuit,
to advertiser boycotts.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.717
We can't afford it. I'm sorry.

20:17.759 --> 20:18.635
I really am.

20:19.553 --> 20:20.554
Wow.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.391
You know, we were supposed
to change things, weren't we?

20:24.892 --> 20:26.518
You and me. That's why they brought us in.

20:27.436 --> 20:30.147
When I came in, they called me an upstart.
And then you started, and they said,

20:30.147 --> 20:32.566
"You're gonna love her.
She's such a disrupter."

20:32.566 --> 20:35.319
We were supposed to shake things up
at UBA, and now look at us.

20:35.319 --> 20:37.905
Three years later, we're just status quo.

20:38.697 --> 20:42.951
"Kill this story. Tweak that copy.
You can't say that on network television."

20:43.577 --> 20:47.998
Honestly, what the fuck, Stella?
It's like death by a thousand cuts.

20:47.998 --> 20:51.919
Bradley, because of who you are,
where you come from,

20:51.919 --> 20:54.296
you can speak to both sides
of the country.

20:54.296 --> 20:57.841
There isn't another news anchor in America
who can do that right now.

20:58.675 --> 21:02.930
And if this next election is contested,
we need our viewers to trust you.

21:04.056 --> 21:07.017
All of them.
That's what I'm trying to protect here.

21:10.646 --> 21:11.647
Got it.

21:43.679 --> 21:45.347
- You look amazing.
- Bradley.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.391
- All right. Thank you.
- Can I get one more?

21:47.391 --> 21:49.643
- One more before you go.
- Thank you, Yanko.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.312
You look amazing.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.564
This way, Bradley.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.358
Thank you, Yanko.

22:02.531 --> 22:03.991
Bradley, one more shot, please.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.868
Hey, can I get a big smile.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.126
You came.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.503
It's the woman of the hour.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.589
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

22:19.423 --> 22:21.133
I thought you hated these things.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.552
Well, I hate manufactured awards.

22:23.552 --> 22:26.513
But this one is actually
about the integrity of our job.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.473
And I thought it would be good

22:28.473 --> 22:31.810
to see each other,
since we run in the same circles.

22:33.604 --> 22:35.480
You know, it doesn't have to be weird.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.524
Between us, I mean.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.943
I'm not mad or anything.

22:40.652 --> 22:41.820
Why would you be?

22:42.487 --> 22:45.741
If you had stayed in Montana,
none of this would be happening tonight.

22:46.241 --> 22:50.078
I don't know. I feel partially
responsible for your meteoric success.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.873
Right.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.000
What?

22:55.709 --> 22:59.630
You didn't want me to stay.
You made that very clear.

23:00.631 --> 23:02.633
So that's the story you're going with?

23:02.633 --> 23:05.385
Story? No, excuse me, Laura.
This is not a--

23:05.385 --> 23:07.846
You pushed me away.
You didn't wanna be there with me.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.432
You wanted to be here with all of this.

23:11.308 --> 23:14.561
- If that's what you think that's what--
- Bradley, Laura. Can you two--

23:14.561 --> 23:15.646
Do you mind?

23:19.191 --> 23:21.777
Smile. People are watching.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.030
That's great. Thank you so much.

23:27.074 --> 23:29.701
Well, I always knew you were
bigger than morning television.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.287
You're on morning television.

23:32.287 --> 23:36.208
<i>YDA</i> has nothing to do with what happened
between us. You know that, right?

23:36.708 --> 23:39.503
Can you excuse me? I'm empty.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.559
I believe acceptance speeches

23:53.559 --> 23:56.562
are typically delivered
while standing upright.

23:57.855 --> 24:01.191
I'm not in the mood for this right now.

24:01.191 --> 24:05.070
Okay. This is just your boss wanting you
to have your moment.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.280
Is that what it is?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.740
Maybe just slow your roll
until after the--

24:08.740 --> 24:13.912
- I don't need you up my ass right now.
- Okay. No more bubbles.

24:13.912 --> 24:17.082
- Don't manage me. Do not.
- Bradley.

24:17.082 --> 24:19.710
I know Stella told you
about the Texas story.

24:20.294 --> 24:23.463
I spent months developing contacts
down there.

24:23.463 --> 24:26.800
News is Stella's department.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.218
But she told you.

24:28.218 --> 24:30.762
She tells me a lot of things.
That doesn't mean I interfere.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.639
Would you interfere if we were together?

24:35.392 --> 24:36.727
Is that what it would take?

24:48.447 --> 24:53.660
<i>Bradley Jackson is a straight
shooter, and in these divisive times,</i>

24:53.660 --> 24:56.788
<i>her commitment to the truth matters
more than ever.</i>

24:58.040 --> 25:02.961
On January 6th, 2021,
our democracy hung in the balance.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.006
We watched on television screens

25:06.006 --> 25:10.093
as violence broke out
at our most revered institution.

25:11.011 --> 25:16.892
But Bradley Jackson didn't watch.
Bradley was there... inside the Capitol.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.938
Separated from her crew in the chaos,

25:21.438 --> 25:23.565
armed with nothing more than
her cell phone,

25:24.566 --> 25:29.154
Bradley captured some of the most
indelible images we have of that day.

25:30.405 --> 25:34.701
And that's the thing about Bradley.
For her, it's always personal.

25:36.245 --> 25:40.582
And that passion for chasing a story
makes her one of the most trusted voices

25:40.582 --> 25:44.628
in television and the highest-rated
network evening news anchor.

25:46.046 --> 25:49.591
She is my inspiration.
She is my good friend.

25:50.884 --> 25:55.264
And it is my absolute honor
to present Bradley Jackson

25:56.265 --> 26:00.561
with the American Alliance
of Journalists First Amendment Award.

26:17.828 --> 26:18.829
Okay.

26:20.956 --> 26:21.957
Okay.

26:33.844 --> 26:35.345
Thank you, Alex.

26:37.472 --> 26:40.434
It's been a whirlwind three years.

26:43.478 --> 26:48.275
And, you know, one thing I've learned
as a journalist, and this is important,

26:50.027 --> 26:52.529
there will always...

26:54.323 --> 26:59.995
always be someone
who tries to silence you.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.005
Don't let them.

28:12.776 --> 28:13.944
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:14.570 --> 28:17.239
That was a very nice speech. Thank you.

28:19.491 --> 28:21.827
Yours was short.

28:24.705 --> 28:25.789
Yeah.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.710
There's this woman in Texas.

28:30.419 --> 28:35.215
And she crosses over the border
every single month into Mexico

28:35.215 --> 28:40.929
to get abortion pills for women who cannot
drive hours to the nearest clinic.

28:40.929 --> 28:44.099
She's doing work that really matters,

28:44.099 --> 28:46.435
and I can't report on it.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.605
You can't report on it,

28:49.605 --> 28:53.108
or you can't go down there
and drive her yourself?

28:54.860 --> 28:58.780
You're evening news now, honey.
You know, you're Dan Rather.

28:59.364 --> 29:00.782
You're Diane Sawyer.

29:02.075 --> 29:04.745
You've wanted this chair
since you landed at UBA.

29:04.745 --> 29:08.290
I don't know why you don't try
just sitting in it for a little while.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.793
I get it. I'm impatient, ungrateful.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.087
Well, yeah, you are.

29:14.087 --> 29:16.840
But you're also fucking great
at what you do.

29:20.427 --> 29:22.804
I just want my work to mean something.

29:25.307 --> 29:27.392
The Supreme Court ruling in June?

29:28.560 --> 29:30.521
2024 election?

29:30.521 --> 29:34.107
I mean, you are reporting on some
of the biggest stories out there.

29:34.107 --> 29:38.320
Huge. I mean, I don't know.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.532
Maybe you just let this one go.

29:43.492 --> 29:45.244
I mean, we can't just--

29:45.244 --> 29:46.870
We can't fight every battle.

29:47.704 --> 29:48.997
We just can't.

30:12.563 --> 30:14.314
Hey, Luna, it's Bradley.

30:17.025 --> 30:19.194
Listen, I don't think that...

30:20.153 --> 30:22.322
I'm gonna be able to make it to Texas.

30:22.322 --> 30:27.244
Just 'cause work has--
It's just gotten a little bit complicated.

30:28.787 --> 30:32.207
And I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.503
But I want you to know something.

30:40.215 --> 30:41.550
I really admire you.

30:43.594 --> 30:44.928
I admire what you do.

30:47.639 --> 30:50.642
<i>And when I was pregnant as a teenager,</i>

30:50.642 --> 30:53.854
<i>I knew that I could never tell my mother.</i>

30:53.854 --> 30:59.651
<i>And there was a woman like you,
and she saved my life.</i>

31:02.821 --> 31:06.658
<i>I just wanted other women to know
that there are people like you out there</i>

31:06.658 --> 31:08.744
<i>and that they don't have to feel alone.</i>

31:11.663 --> 31:13.582
<i>Again, I'm just-- I'm sorry.</i>

31:23.550 --> 31:26.011
- This is what Bradley was talking about.
- Yep.

31:26.011 --> 31:27.888
I don't-- How is this 2022?

31:27.888 --> 31:30.015
It's, like, <i>Twilight Zone</i> crazy.

31:32.976 --> 31:34.770
You should try to get some sleep.

31:35.312 --> 31:39.441
Out of 120 abortion clinics in Texas,
how many do you think are fake?

31:41.318 --> 31:42.861
I don't know, like, 30?

31:42.861 --> 31:45.405
According to this article, a hundred.

31:45.405 --> 31:48.825
A hundred clinics routinely lie
to pregnant women

31:48.825 --> 31:50.536
about how far along they are,

31:50.536 --> 31:53.872
so that they think they're too late
to terminate the pregnancy.

31:53.872 --> 31:55.791
I mean, they'll be three weeks along,

31:55.791 --> 31:57.793
and they'll tell them
that they're eight weeks,

31:57.793 --> 32:00.754
- because the cutoff is six weeks.
- Wow. It's sick.

32:00.754 --> 32:01.839
- Fucked up.
- That's--

32:01.839 --> 32:03.715
I mean, it's really horrifying, yeah.

32:03.715 --> 32:08.262
But where is this coming from right now?
You're-- Are you spinning?

32:08.262 --> 32:12.140
You read numbers like this, it's insane.
It just pisses me off.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.976
You go to your doctor,
you don't wanna be lied to.

32:13.976 --> 32:15.352
I agree. We all agree.

32:15.352 --> 32:17.479
Things in Texas suck, lots of things.

32:17.479 --> 32:21.650
But maybe we just, like, I don't know,
look forward to the barbecue.

32:22.651 --> 32:23.735
Yeah, it's delicious.

32:24.778 --> 32:27.865
Brisket roasted over the ashes
of women's autonomy.

32:28.448 --> 32:29.616
Okay.

32:52.389 --> 32:53.515
Wow.

32:53.515 --> 32:56.310
- Oh, my God. Could it be any hotter?
- Yeah.

32:56.894 --> 32:57.978
And it's only March.

32:57.978 --> 33:00.022
Yeah, well, welcome to the future, Mia.
Look at this thing.

33:00.689 --> 33:01.690
Oh, my God.

33:06.069 --> 33:07.112
There he is.

33:16.205 --> 33:17.206
He's tall.

33:18.123 --> 33:19.625
<i>Welcome to Hyperion.</i>

33:20.167 --> 33:23.754
Tomorrow's short flight
will be the beginning of a new era.

33:23.754 --> 33:28.800
These suborbital tests will help
develop the vital technology

33:28.800 --> 33:32.262
to carry humans far, far beyond the moon.

33:32.262 --> 33:34.890
There's that word again. "Test."

33:34.890 --> 33:38.477
And UBA is an essential part
of that project.

33:38.477 --> 33:41.813
By showing the world what we do live
on <i>The Morning Show</i>,

33:41.813 --> 33:43.690
we hope to generate the kind of excitement

33:43.690 --> 33:47.361
that will bring in new support
for the next space age.

33:47.361 --> 33:48.529
Thank you.

33:55.536 --> 33:58.372
We have Chris on standby,
in case you wanna shoot anything.

33:58.872 --> 33:59.706
Okay.

34:02.584 --> 34:05.420
Why the fuck did we agree to this?
The last thing I need right now

34:05.420 --> 34:07.256
is a TV crew up my ass.

34:07.256 --> 34:10.467
- Want me to send them home? No.
- Yes. Could you?

34:10.467 --> 34:13.219
These nice people are gonna
help us keep that big,

34:13.219 --> 34:16.639
fat NASA contract that you want so much.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.018
What do you think of her?

34:21.018 --> 34:23.647
I don't know.
She walks on water in Milwaukee.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.608
How do you think she is in zero gravity?

34:27.109 --> 34:28.652
- Alex.
- Yes.

34:28.652 --> 34:30.070
- Paul Marks.
- Hi.

34:30.070 --> 34:32.697
- How do you do? Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

34:32.697 --> 34:35.742
This is all very impressive.

34:35.742 --> 34:36.952
Thanks.

34:36.952 --> 34:39.538
Listen, we really haven't had
a chance to talk.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.748
- Can I show you around the facility?
- Yeah.

34:44.251 --> 34:45.710
- Give me a second. Okay.
- Yeah.

34:54.553 --> 34:58.557
My God.
Quite the tour, that I wasn't expecting.

34:59.266 --> 35:00.809
- Oh, my God.
- We're almost there.

35:00.809 --> 35:02.895
Great. Jesus!

35:05.772 --> 35:07.482
Oh, my God.

35:09.234 --> 35:11.737
- Don't you love it?
- Amazing.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.751
What is it with you rich boys
and your toys?

35:25.751 --> 35:27.169
Good God.

35:27.169 --> 35:29.463
Do you have a death wish or something?

35:29.463 --> 35:31.173
- You're fine.
- Oh, God.

35:31.173 --> 35:33.800
Why did any of that have to happen?

35:33.800 --> 35:35.761
You know, the rocket goes a lot faster.

35:35.761 --> 35:38.597
Yeah, but you won't be driving that, right?

35:38.597 --> 35:41.308
Didn't you get out of Bosnia
on a motorcycle or something?

35:41.308 --> 35:43.268
Yeah, like a hundred years ago.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.190
You read my book.

35:48.190 --> 35:49.358
I did.

35:49.358 --> 35:52.402
Everybody thought they knew you,
but you showed them something else.

35:52.903 --> 35:55.072
I could use a rebrand like that.

35:55.072 --> 35:57.157
Yeah, I'm sure you're very misunderstood.

35:57.157 --> 36:00.327
Yeah. All those other billionaires
really fucked it up for me.

36:00.327 --> 36:01.828
Those billionaires.

36:03.247 --> 36:08.168
Wow. This is all yours.

36:08.752 --> 36:13.674
Yes, it is. 200,000 unspoiled acres,
and I plan to keep it that way.

36:15.008 --> 36:16.969
Big on personal space, huh?

36:18.303 --> 36:19.388
Yes, I am.

36:24.685 --> 36:27.604
Well, it's really beautiful.

36:30.649 --> 36:31.817
I think so.

36:35.445 --> 36:36.697
So you read my book?

36:36.697 --> 36:38.532
Well, my assistant did.

36:39.533 --> 36:40.534
Okay.

36:42.327 --> 36:43.745
Of course I read your book.

36:44.913 --> 36:47.374
Maybe someday you'll tell me
what isn't in it.

36:52.671 --> 36:55.007
I have to ask you, what is going on here?

36:57.176 --> 37:00.345
- What? Aren't we just talking?
- No, I don't-- I mean, all of this.

37:01.638 --> 37:05.100
What are you getting out of
a 13-minute joyride on <i>The Morning Show</i>?

37:09.313 --> 37:12.941
I don't-- Well, I thought we maybe should
get to know each other a little bit

37:12.941 --> 37:14.985
before this deal goes through.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.364
What deal?

37:24.119 --> 37:25.454
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

37:25.454 --> 37:29.374
So you're selling UBA to Paul Marks?

37:30.459 --> 37:32.211
When were you gonna tell me about this?

37:32.211 --> 37:34.713
Or was I supposed to read about it
in the fucking trades?

37:34.713 --> 37:39.134
Just-- It's just a conversation,
Alex, and you're out of your lane.

37:39.134 --> 37:41.678
- I'm out of my lane? Fuck my lane.
- Yep.

37:42.346 --> 37:45.098
Oh, my gosh. This is all so clear now.

37:45.098 --> 37:47.392
Why you're pimping me out
on that rocket ship.

37:47.392 --> 37:49.186
So you could close a deal.

37:49.186 --> 37:52.064
This is why I have to be a partner, Cory.
I need to be brought in on this shit.

37:52.064 --> 37:53.732
- You want to be brought in?
- Yes.

37:53.732 --> 37:56.652
You want to be brought in. Okay. Fine.

37:57.653 --> 38:02.574
The world as we know it is over, Alex.
We are officially in the Thunderdome.

38:02.574 --> 38:04.868
In five years,
half of the streaming services,

38:04.868 --> 38:06.578
they'll be gone or bought out.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.914
In ten years, the Internet will be 3D.

38:08.914 --> 38:11.458
You will literally be
in people's living rooms.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.753
We need to build a time machine
to take us to the future,

38:15.254 --> 38:20.717
and that is gonna take real deep pockets.

38:21.718 --> 38:23.387
Someone with more money than God.

38:24.012 --> 38:26.515
And Bill Gates, he won't return my calls

38:26.515 --> 38:29.476
since I crushed him
in doubles at Sun Valley.

38:30.394 --> 38:33.272
So, Paul Marks,

38:34.481 --> 38:38.861
that's the hand that we have been dealt
in this game of three-card capitalism.

38:38.861 --> 38:41.280
And honestly,
I'm happy to be at the table.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.156
I wanna play. I wanna win.

38:43.156 --> 38:46.785
In fact, I wanna build something
that matters even when nothing else does.

38:46.785 --> 38:50.706
With that guy?
That's who you see for the future of UBA?

38:50.706 --> 38:53.750
Some need-for-speed hard-ass
from Silicon Valley?

38:53.750 --> 38:56.628
Well, we don't like his offer,
we walk away.

38:56.628 --> 38:58.130
Alex, I mean, come on.

38:58.130 --> 39:01.175
You could just trust
that I'm doing what's best for you.

39:01.175 --> 39:03.093
Right. I do. I forget that.

39:03.093 --> 39:05.637
I forget that you always have
my best interest at heart.

39:05.637 --> 39:08.473
You know, Paul and I,
we just had some conversations. That's it.

39:11.310 --> 39:12.352
Yeah.

39:16.857 --> 39:18.442
You haven't told Cybil yet.

39:22.571 --> 39:24.406
You haven't told anybody yet.

39:26.700 --> 39:30.746
I promise, if this happens,

39:32.497 --> 39:34.291
you will be taken care of.

40:06.949 --> 40:08.659
God, I'm so sick of men.

40:09.868 --> 40:10.869
Thank you?

40:10.869 --> 40:15.541
- No, not you. Men with power.
- Again, thank you very much.

40:15.541 --> 40:16.792
That's nice.

40:17.668 --> 40:21.463
Paul fucking Marks.
Paul fucking Marks? Jesus.

40:21.463 --> 40:24.091
I mean, look, he's not exactly known
for sharing his toys, you know?

40:24.091 --> 40:25.843
What the fuck was Cory thinking?

40:25.843 --> 40:28.846
That he would massively
upgrade his profile

40:28.846 --> 40:31.807
by getting into bed
with a fucking billionaire.

40:33.851 --> 40:36.395
He's using me as his honey trap.

40:36.395 --> 40:40.357
This fucker who couldn't wait to get rid
of me three years ago.

40:42.276 --> 40:44.027
Put in all this time, you know?

40:44.820 --> 40:49.533
Twenty years
and it just doesn't mean anything.

40:49.533 --> 40:51.869
- Doesn't mean a fucking thing.
- I know.

40:51.869 --> 40:57.040
We are only here to keep
the stockholders happy, and that is it.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.834
I'm so tired of being managed.

41:00.836 --> 41:03.589
You ask for things politely
like a grown-up,

41:03.589 --> 41:05.507
- and you just get nothing.
- Yep.

41:06.383 --> 41:10.095
Why do I have to set something on fire
to get someone to listen to me?

41:10.095 --> 41:11.889
'Cause Cory's a fucking pyromaniac,

41:11.889 --> 41:13.849
and that's
the only language he understands, and--

41:13.849 --> 41:17.394
I just didn't do all this
to become a corporate Stepford wife.

41:18.854 --> 41:19.855
God.

41:19.855 --> 41:21.857
Just fuck 'em.
You know what I mean? Fuck them.

41:21.857 --> 41:24.359
Fuck their rocket. Stupid f--

41:25.277 --> 41:27.988
- Fuck 'em.
- Seriously.

41:29.990 --> 41:31.033
Okay.

41:34.995 --> 41:36.038
Shit.

41:36.038 --> 41:37.706
What? Shit, what?

41:38.290 --> 41:39.583
It's Bradley.

41:41.084 --> 41:42.294
What? What is it?

41:42.961 --> 41:48.258
"Luna got arrested. Headed to Del Rio.
Can you spare a camera operator?"

41:49.134 --> 41:50.219
Shit.

41:54.056 --> 41:55.599
Wait, what?

42:03.857 --> 42:05.651
Earl, what is it?

42:05.651 --> 42:08.070
<i>Bradley Jackson is on her way to JFK.</i>

42:08.070 --> 42:11.114
<i>Told her team she won't be back
for tomorrow evening's broadcast.</i>

42:11.114 --> 42:12.574
<i>She's going to Texas.</i>

42:14.076 --> 42:15.369
Of course she is.

42:35.931 --> 42:37.182
Oh, God.

42:37.683 --> 42:40.769
Alex? It's Mia.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.903
Where is she?

42:49.903 --> 42:51.196
It's not personal.

42:51.196 --> 42:53.991
- She wants you to know that. Fuck me.
- Oh, my God.

43:16.305 --> 43:17.639
Alex is gone.

43:18.307 --> 43:19.766
How gone?

43:19.766 --> 43:21.977
The kind where I wake you up four hours

43:21.977 --> 43:24.521
before a rocket launch gone.

43:24.521 --> 43:26.064
- Can I blame you?
- What?

43:26.064 --> 43:28.609
No! She bailed on purpose.

43:29.568 --> 43:32.654
- Why?
- Does it matter? She's not here.

43:32.654 --> 43:33.906
- Okay.
- Okay?

43:33.906 --> 43:34.823
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:34.823 --> 43:38.911
So we need somebody
who can deliver the news in space.

43:38.911 --> 43:41.663
Yeah. I think it's gotta be Yanko.
He's a scientist. He would kill to go.

43:41.663 --> 43:44.416
No, no. It's Women's History Month.

43:45.250 --> 43:46.710
Our advertisers will freak.

43:48.086 --> 43:50.589
There really only is one option.

43:50.589 --> 43:52.174
It's an incredible opportunity.

43:52.174 --> 43:53.675
An Olympic champion in space.

43:53.675 --> 43:55.177
We're gonna turn it
into a regular segment.

43:55.177 --> 43:56.303
Educate our viewers on the science

43:56.303 --> 43:57.596
- of going into space.
- You said--

43:57.596 --> 43:59.389
You said you wanted
to get more girls into STEM.

43:59.389 --> 44:01.308
- For sure. Yeah.
- You said that.

44:01.308 --> 44:04.978
Paul Marks wants Alex.
So does everybody else. I haven't trained.

44:04.978 --> 44:08.148
- Oh, well. The training is bullshit.
- You don't need to train.

44:08.148 --> 44:10.234
You can do it. You're an Olympic champion.

44:10.234 --> 44:12.319
- I'm on three hours of sleep.
- So?

44:12.319 --> 44:14.363
You want me to get into a metal tube

44:14.363 --> 44:16.365
full of thousands of gallons
of rocket fuel

44:16.365 --> 44:18.242
on its first manned flight?

44:18.742 --> 44:20.452
- Well--
- Yeah.

44:20.452 --> 44:22.621
- Yes, but it's not--
- It's not that hard.

44:22.621 --> 44:24.623
I'm gonna pass on being your guinea pig.

44:24.623 --> 44:27.209
- Are you sure?
- See you at the launch.

44:30.879 --> 44:33.340
Huh. That went well.

44:33.340 --> 44:34.550
Now what?

44:39.596 --> 44:42.266
Hey, we have a problem.

44:43.308 --> 44:46.687
<i>Welcome to San Antonio
International Airport.</i>

44:55.904 --> 44:58.782
Cory. What are you doing here?

44:58.782 --> 45:01.243
- Well, we need to talk.
- No, I can't. I gotta go.

45:01.243 --> 45:03.036
- I got a source who's in trouble.
- Luna?

45:03.036 --> 45:04.746
- I know she's been arrested.
- What?

45:06.081 --> 45:07.708
Wait, are you trying to stop me?

45:07.708 --> 45:09.877
There's nothing
that you can do for her now.

45:09.877 --> 45:11.461
I've called Legal. They're on it, okay?

45:11.461 --> 45:13.088
Because y'all have been so supportive.

45:13.088 --> 45:16.175
Hey, I am not punishing you.

45:16.717 --> 45:20.804
I would never do that.
But I need you to do something for me.

45:22.097 --> 45:23.098
Okay.

45:23.098 --> 45:26.185
Hey. I was there for you, remember?

45:31.231 --> 45:33.317
I need you to return the favor.

45:44.828 --> 45:46.997
Yeah. Okay. What is it?

45:49.333 --> 45:51.877
Well, since you're in the neighborhood,

45:51.877 --> 45:53.504
wanna go to space?

45:54.505 --> 45:57.174
Oh, my God.
I can't believe he got you to do this.

45:57.674 --> 45:59.051
I really-- I can't believe it.

45:59.051 --> 46:00.886
How are you not coming?
This is your story.

46:00.886 --> 46:03.263
<i>You have been chasing this story, Bradley.</i>

46:03.263 --> 46:06.934
Well, it's your story now,
so shoot the shit out of it, okay?

46:07.518 --> 46:09.520
And tell Luna I'm sorry.

46:10.229 --> 46:13.232
And if it all goes south,
you can have my dressing room.

46:13.232 --> 46:15.108
Well, what about your apartment?

46:16.193 --> 46:17.694
You mean the one you haven't even seen?

46:19.029 --> 46:21.823
Oh, God. Please,
you know you don't have to do this, right?

46:23.784 --> 46:26.161
I know. It's-- But it's like you said.

46:26.161 --> 46:28.580
Maybe I don't have to fight every battle.

46:30.290 --> 46:33.377
Please just be safe. God, please be safe.

46:33.377 --> 46:34.837
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

46:43.929 --> 46:46.014
So, folks,
we have a last-minute change of plans.

46:46.014 --> 46:48.809
We've just learned that Alex
unfortunately suffered a minor injury

46:48.809 --> 46:50.477
while she was training
earlier this morning.

46:50.477 --> 46:52.396
So out of an abundance
of caution,

46:52.396 --> 46:55.691
our <i>Evening News</i> anchor Bradley Jackson,
she's gonna be going in her place.

46:55.691 --> 46:59.111
And Alex is fine.
She just felt it best to step aside.

46:59.111 --> 47:00.529
<i>That's right.
Despite the quick change of plans...</i>

47:00.529 --> 47:01.655
Go quickly to camera three.

47:01.655 --> 47:04.449
<i>...Bradley was actually able to complete
that training pretty quickly,</i>

47:04.449 --> 47:05.576
<i>so she's good to go.</i>

47:05.576 --> 47:08.287
And I'm thrilled to be here
with you in beautiful West Texas.

47:08.287 --> 47:10.581
- Look at this big, blue, Lone Star sky.
- Yeah.

47:10.581 --> 47:13.083
And I can only imagine how incredibly
excited Bradley must be.

47:13.083 --> 47:16.461
I know she is insanely excited.

47:26.471 --> 47:29.183
My body, my choice. My body, my choice.

47:29.183 --> 47:33.228
I'm here in Del Rio, Texas,
a small city on the US-Mexico border,

47:33.228 --> 47:36.690
where a 19-year-old woman
is being held in this building

47:36.690 --> 47:38.817
since she was arrested late yesterday.

47:39.318 --> 47:41.320
- She is part--
- Back it up. You need to clear the area.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.864
She is part of an underground network
of volunteers

47:43.864 --> 47:46.992
who have been bringing abortion pills
from Mexico into the US.

47:46.992 --> 47:50.078
Medication abortion is safe,
and it is effective,

47:50.078 --> 47:53.874
and here in the remote Rio Grande Valley
often the only option.

47:57.920 --> 48:02.508
Well, congratulations, Paul.
This is Bradley Jackson.

48:02.508 --> 48:06.053
You just got yourself a whole new set
of viewers south of the Mason-Dixon line.

48:06.053 --> 48:08.388
Well, thanks for the ride.
I'm gonna try not to throw up.

48:08.388 --> 48:10.265
Well, there's a bag underneath your seat.

48:10.265 --> 48:11.892
Just make sure you seal it.

48:21.985 --> 48:25.781
Cory Ellison, boy wonder.
Looks like you can't deliver after all.

49:00.399 --> 49:02.025
<i>SNA arm rotation enabled.</i>

49:02.025 --> 49:03.944
<i>Stage one tanks pressing for flight.</i>

49:03.944 --> 49:05.195
Take camera five.

49:06.655 --> 49:08.782
<i>GLS mainline has been initiated.</i>

49:08.782 --> 49:11.118
<i>All personnel,
we are going to resume the clock.</i>

49:12.703 --> 49:13.787
All right.

49:13.787 --> 49:18.542
The G's can be a little intense, but
it's only for the first couple of minutes.

49:18.542 --> 49:20.919
This is nothing.
I used to fly Spirit Airlines.

49:22.921 --> 49:24.715
<i>T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

49:26.466 --> 49:27.718
Standby to launch.

49:27.718 --> 49:29.428
- <i>Ten, nine...</i>
- Ten, nine...

49:29.428 --> 49:34.808
<i>...eight, seven, six, five, four, three...</i>

49:35.392 --> 49:36.935
- <i>two, one.</i>
- Two, one!

49:44.985 --> 49:47.404
Hyperion One <i>has cleared the tower.</i>

49:47.988 --> 49:50.782
- <i>You can feel the ground shaking.</i>
- Keep it.

49:59.249 --> 50:02.085
That is absolutely incredible.
The power of this thing--

50:02.085 --> 50:04.630
It takes a lot of juice
to punch a hole in that sky.

50:04.630 --> 50:06.089
We'll be seeing footage

50:06.089 --> 50:08.634
- <i>of Earth from the rocket itself.</i>
- Stay with it, five. Stay with it.

50:08.634 --> 50:13.430
Hyperion One <i>will reach a top speed
of 2,250 miles an hour.</i>

50:13.430 --> 50:14.890
<i>It's impressive, Chris.</i>

50:14.890 --> 50:18.435
<i>That's right.
And reach an apogee of about 350,000 feet,</i>

50:18.435 --> 50:20.521
<i>which is about 62 miles
above the Earth's surface.</i>

50:25.234 --> 50:28.195
So <i>Hyperion One</i> is now
closing in on the Kármán Line.

50:28.195 --> 50:30.989
That's the delineation
between Earth's atmosphere and space.

50:30.989 --> 50:33.450
- And everything looks A-okay.
- It does indeed.

51:06.775 --> 51:12.114
"The all-knowing mind, empty and radiant."

51:47.232 --> 51:48.692
Any regrets?

51:58.744 --> 52:01.747
Everybody ready? Time to fly.

53:02.766 --> 53:04.685
<i>Bradley, this is incredible.</i>

53:04.685 --> 53:06.353
<i>Can you tell us what you're seeing?</i>

53:06.353 --> 53:08.063
<i>How do things look from up there?</i>

53:08.063 --> 53:09.565
Hi.

53:10.440 --> 53:15.946
After two years of a pandemic
and now a war in Ukraine,

53:16.947 --> 53:20.742
it's incredible to look down
and see how connected we all are.

53:20.742 --> 53:21.827
That's so true. I--

53:24.162 --> 53:25.289
<i>Hello, sorry--</i>

53:25.289 --> 53:27.124
<i>I think we lost you, Bradley.
Are you there? Hello?</i>

53:27.708 --> 53:29.459
- What just happened?
- <i>Bradley, are you--</i>

53:29.459 --> 53:31.962
- <i>Can you hear me? Are you able to hear me?</i>
- I don't know.

53:33.881 --> 53:35.632
<i>Do you copy? Can you hear me?</i>

53:35.632 --> 53:36.717
<i>Bradley?</i>
