WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:03.099
I would like to propose a toast

00:03.175 --> 00:06.008
to QB One of the Dillon Panthers.
Cheers, pal.

00:06.078 --> 00:08.444
I got really drunk last night.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

00:08.514 --> 00:10.448
I think our band
could be really great.

00:10.516 --> 00:12.416
You really need to
get over this girl.

00:12.484 --> 00:13.473
Let's get to work.

00:13.552 --> 00:15.543
And let's start
with this here work list.

00:15.621 --> 00:17.350
I miss you guys like crazy,
you know that, right?

00:17.423 --> 00:18.685
We love you, too.

00:18.757 --> 00:19.814
Put the little man on.

00:19.891 --> 00:21.449
Am I really that boring
to talk to?

00:21.526 --> 00:23.858
No, I just don't want
my son to forget my voice.

00:23.928 --> 00:26.624
I'm so proud of you.
You're here with me and not with Mom.

00:26.697 --> 00:27.789
It's a great day then.
Let's go.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.125
So where the
hell's gate 4?

00:30.201 --> 00:32.259
Actually,
I'm pretty sure it's gate 2.

00:32.336 --> 00:36.204
Thank you very much for your unsolicited
wrong opinion, Mr. Tim Riggins.

00:36.274 --> 00:38.435
Dad, I think we should
talk about this camping thing.

00:38.509 --> 00:40.101
Honey, this is going
to be quality family time...

00:40.178 --> 00:41.702
I think they're just
going to want to hang out

00:41.813 --> 00:43.576
and see their friends while they're here.
...out in nature.

00:46.017 --> 00:47.450
There
they are.

00:47.552 --> 00:49.247
Hi, guys. Hi.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.049
Look at them.
They're big, they're big. They're big.

00:51.122 --> 00:52.248
Hi, Tabby.

00:52.323 --> 00:56.623
Little Bud. Little Bud.
Hey, Bud, how're you doing, Buddy?

00:56.694 --> 00:59.753
Good to see you. Look at you.
How big you are.

00:59.830 --> 01:01.297
You better call Mack Brown...
No.

01:01.364 --> 01:02.956
And tell him we got
a linebacker, right here.

01:03.033 --> 01:04.694
No, I'm into soccer now, Dad.

01:04.768 --> 01:07.794
Son, football is in
the Garrity DNA.

01:07.871 --> 01:08.895
You're going to be
a football player.

01:08.972 --> 01:12.271
Look at my little sweetheart.
Hey, baby. You look like a hippie.

01:13.443 --> 01:15.070
Give me a big, old hug.

01:15.145 --> 01:16.840
Dad, Dad, you're all sweaty.

01:16.913 --> 01:19.245
No, I'm not sweaty.
Jeez, no.

01:19.316 --> 01:20.647
All right, let's go.

01:21.818 --> 01:24.082
For just how long do you
think this is going to last?

01:24.154 --> 01:26.588
I don't know, honey.
Well, let's not make it last too long.

01:26.656 --> 01:29.056
Oh, no.
But it'll be fine. Come on.

01:32.729 --> 01:34.025
Guess what I have upstairs?

01:34.096 --> 01:35.996
I have a brand new bedroom.
You've got to see it.

01:36.065 --> 01:37.430
It just totally
changed my life.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.694
I'm going to go
around and see it real quick

01:38.767 --> 01:40.064
and then we should go.
He's going to drag me home.

01:40.136 --> 01:41.194
'Cause you're going to
want one.

01:41.270 --> 01:43.738
Sweetie, five minutes,
please. Okay, don't...

01:43.806 --> 01:44.864
I'm sorry, coach.
Hey.

01:44.940 --> 01:46.100
Hi, J.D.
How are you?

01:46.175 --> 01:47.199
Good.

01:47.276 --> 01:49.005
J.D. how are you?
Hey, coach, how are you?

01:49.078 --> 01:50.978
We've got a tee time Sunday
at 9:00 a.m.

01:51.046 --> 01:52.673
All right.

01:52.748 --> 01:54.272
Better bring your "A" game,
old man.

01:54.350 --> 01:56.648
He's hurting me,
coach.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.920
My "A" game? Excuse me.

01:59.155 --> 02:02.022
Coach is here, tell the truth.
Who won last time?

02:02.091 --> 02:03.422
You did.
That's correct.

02:03.492 --> 02:05.585
All right, well, I'm going to bed.
I'm tired.

02:05.661 --> 02:06.650
Goodnight, Dad.
Goodnight.

02:06.729 --> 02:07.787
Goodnight, coach.
Goodnight.

02:07.897 --> 02:09.762
Love you.
Love you, too.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.161
He's a good boy.
He is a very good boy.

02:14.602 --> 02:17.696
Due mostly to my wife,
but he's a very good boy.

02:20.942 --> 02:22.102
Listen, just real quick.

02:22.177 --> 02:24.509
Yesterday, at church, when
you were speaking about J.D.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.843
As his coach, that made me
a little uncomfortable.

02:26.948 --> 02:28.575
I didn't mean to
cross any lines, I'm sorry.

02:28.650 --> 02:29.878
No, no. I understand that.

02:29.951 --> 02:32.442
You know, he's a very special
boy and I just hate it

02:32.520 --> 02:34.750
when I see him screwing things
up like that. That's all.

02:34.822 --> 02:35.811
That's understood.

02:35.924 --> 02:40.520
Thank you for bringing it up. It's appreciated.
And it will not happen again.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.153
Well, it's not
a matter of that.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.130
It's just...
We're good.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.406
So what do you think?
You think you can help?

02:55.876 --> 02:58.367
Well, I mean,
it's a recruitment letter.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.072
From OU, that's nice, but...

03:00.147 --> 03:01.876
Yeah, I mean, we've
gotten a couple of these

03:01.949 --> 03:04.144
and, you know, I replied but I
haven't heard anything back.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.345
So, I mean...
Well.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.953
It's a pretty basic
recruitment letter. Yeah.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.388
Thank you.

03:11.858 --> 03:15.089
You know, they probably
send out a lot of them.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.596
You know, I got a few hundred when
I was in high school, still, so...

03:18.732 --> 03:21.394
Yeah. Seems not exactly
college material.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.834
I wouldn't keep my hopes
too high.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.134
Look, Street,
I know the kid's an idiot.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.401
You don't have to
tell me about it.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.272
But if there is anything I can
do to get him into college,

03:31.344 --> 03:33.403
I need to know what it is.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.075
Forget it.

03:36.148 --> 03:38.673
So stupid. I mean, what the hell
would I know about this, anyway?

03:38.751 --> 03:40.912
No, it's not.
It's not stupid.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.215
Really, it's just...

03:42.288 --> 03:45.257
He's just going to have to work harder than
the other five-star recruits out there,

03:45.324 --> 03:46.416
you know.
Look, man,

03:46.492 --> 03:49.052
you know way more
about this stuff than I do.

03:49.128 --> 03:51.358
Just tell me what I need to do.

03:53.165 --> 03:56.293
I'd say the first thing to do is, throw
together a highlight reel for him.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.494
Go through all of his games,

03:57.570 --> 03:59.333
and pick out some of his best
plays, throw them on the tape.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.737
Maybe get an interview of Coach,
or something like that, you know.

04:01.807 --> 04:03.671
You throw it all together.
You send it out to all the schools.

04:03.742 --> 04:04.902
You'll maybe raise a
little bit of interest.

04:04.976 --> 04:07.001
Oh, I like that.
It's good.

04:07.846 --> 04:09.814
Hey, we're making a movie.

04:09.881 --> 04:10.905
Movie?
Yeah.

04:10.982 --> 04:12.142
What are you talking about?

04:12.217 --> 04:14.412
Pretty ambitious. Don't worry about it.
I'll tell you about it later.

04:14.486 --> 04:16.784
What're you guys doing?
Yeah, seriously.

04:16.855 --> 04:18.550
What do you mean?
We're not doing anything.

04:18.623 --> 04:20.988
Because we're finished.
With everything?

04:21.059 --> 04:24.927
Uh... Yeah, man. The paint's dry.
The curtains are up,

04:24.996 --> 04:27.897
and extremely unique, and there ain't
nothing left to spackle but Billy's mouth.

04:27.966 --> 04:29.558
I think we're good.
Oh, that's funny.

04:31.002 --> 04:32.902
Look what two idiots and a
couple of cripples can do.

04:32.971 --> 04:34.097
It's a job well done, fellows.

04:34.172 --> 04:35.230
It's like the Special Olympics.

04:35.307 --> 04:37.366
All right, so what's next?
Do we call that Missy lady?

04:37.442 --> 04:38.534
That realtor lady?

04:38.610 --> 04:39.872
No.
No, we don't call her.

04:39.943 --> 04:43.174
All she's gonna want to do is stick a sign
on the ground and charge us six percent.

04:43.247 --> 04:44.305
So, no, we don't call her.

04:44.381 --> 04:46.508
Okay, so what do we do then?

04:46.850 --> 04:49.512
We sell the house.
Ourselves.

04:49.586 --> 04:50.985
What?

04:51.055 --> 04:52.522
I mean, how hard could
it be, you know.

04:52.589 --> 04:53.681
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.440 --> 05:46.169
Tami, it was an accident, okay?

05:46.242 --> 05:48.176
Jamarcus is a good kid.
He just got a little carried away.

05:48.244 --> 05:49.233
It's no big deal, all right?

05:49.312 --> 05:51.212
Come on. You tell that
to Bree Hudson's mother.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.373
Hey, we're talking about our
starting fullback, here, you know.

05:53.449 --> 05:54.437
I know who we're talking about.

05:54.516 --> 05:56.984
This is his third time
in my office this semester.

05:57.052 --> 05:59.247
Jamarcus Hall.

05:59.321 --> 06:01.551
Hello, sir.
Hi, Principal Taylor.

06:01.723 --> 06:03.486
First of all, I want to say
that it was an accident.

06:03.558 --> 06:06.618
Sit down. Come on, now.
Good lord.

06:09.131 --> 06:11.531
We've been down
this road before.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.931
Yes, ma'am.

06:13.402 --> 06:16.098
And what did we talk about last
time when we had this conversation?

06:16.171 --> 06:17.331
But you've got to let me play
Friday, you know.

06:17.406 --> 06:18.964
I have to.
That is a conversation

06:19.040 --> 06:22.441
that we are going to have to have with
your parents this afternoon after school.

06:22.511 --> 06:23.603
Mrs. Taylor, we can't
call my parents.

06:23.678 --> 06:24.702
That's what we talked about.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.772
Maybe we ought to bring Coach Taylor
in the loop on this thing, here.

06:28.016 --> 06:31.281
Coach McGill, why do we need to talk
to Coach Taylor about a conversation

06:31.353 --> 06:34.116
I'm going to be having with Jamarcus
and his parents this afternoon?

06:34.188 --> 06:36.816
Now, y'all both get on out of here,
'cause I need to call your parents.

06:36.891 --> 06:40.486
You need to think, sir.
I'll see you later on.

06:41.662 --> 06:44.290
Thank you for your help,
Coach McGill.

06:44.398 --> 06:45.763
Come on.
Well.

06:45.866 --> 06:47.128
Honestly.

06:49.637 --> 06:51.867
Hey, Landry.

06:52.506 --> 06:54.371
Hi.
What are you doing?

06:54.642 --> 06:58.510
Nothing, I'm just sitting here playing
guitar, and not thinking about Tyra.

06:58.579 --> 07:00.843
Oh. Tyra.

07:00.915 --> 07:03.315
Hey, y'all.
This is Tyra Collette reminding everyone

07:03.384 --> 07:05.978
that Dillon High's
annual blood drive is today.

07:06.153 --> 07:08.780
So come on down and donate
blood, sixth period,

07:08.855 --> 07:10.322
and get a free cookie.

07:10.390 --> 07:12.153
That's unbelievable.

07:13.259 --> 07:14.886
She's everywhere.

07:19.866 --> 07:23.996
I know a girl who
thinks of toast

07:25.171 --> 07:29.608
She'll make you breakfast
She'll make you toast

07:30.577 --> 07:35.776
She don't use butter
She don't use cheese

07:36.549 --> 07:42.784
She don't use jelly
or any of these

07:43.756 --> 07:44.745
Cheer up.

07:46.325 --> 07:52.889
She uses Vaseline

07:53.098 --> 07:58.468
She uses Vaseline

07:59.371 --> 08:01.805
I thought for sure
that would cheer you up.

08:01.874 --> 08:04.866
This whole emo thing
you've got going on...

08:04.943 --> 08:09.107
It's okay. But will you give me a
ride home tomorrow after practice?

08:09.681 --> 08:12.479
I will give you a ride after
practice tomorrow. Okay.

08:12.551 --> 08:15.918
Thank you.
Just cheer up, you know.

08:18.490 --> 08:21.755
Tomorrow's a brand new day.
Nothing to worry about.

08:22.694 --> 08:24.888
New things.
I'll see you soon.

08:27.164 --> 08:30.656
Tim Riggins. Number 33
for the Dillon Panthers.

08:30.735 --> 08:32.293
What are your interests?

08:32.370 --> 08:34.395
My interests?
I like football.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.597
Yeah.
And...

08:35.673 --> 08:38.369
I love, you know,
playing on Friday nights.

08:38.442 --> 08:40.876
And hopefully
I can play Saturday nights.

08:40.945 --> 08:41.969
That's college night.

08:42.046 --> 08:43.535
I'm not a big fan
of practice, though.

08:43.614 --> 08:44.945
You love Gwen Stefani, bananas.

08:45.016 --> 08:46.916
What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell was that, man?

08:46.984 --> 08:48.542
What are you doing, man?
I've seen you tapping your toes.

08:48.619 --> 08:50.780
What are you talking about?
Dude, we're trying to shoot a video, man.

08:50.855 --> 08:51.913
That was my best take yet.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.854
Oh, you think that's your
best take yet, man?

08:53.925 --> 08:55.119
Hey, guys.

08:55.192 --> 08:56.216
What?

08:57.061 --> 08:59.393
We've got to keep our eye on the ball, okay?
And that's this house.

08:59.463 --> 09:00.952
Can we focus?
I'm focused.

09:01.031 --> 09:02.430
Okay, I went out.
I got the set-up sheets.

09:02.499 --> 09:05.127
I think they look pretty good.
Does anybody else want to take a look at them?

09:05.201 --> 09:06.259
Yes.

09:06.403 --> 09:08.371
That's damn good, man.
Color and everything. Thank you.

09:08.438 --> 09:09.803
Whoa! Whoa!

09:09.873 --> 09:12.034
295? I thought
you said 265.

09:12.108 --> 09:13.166
What?

09:13.243 --> 09:14.232
Well,
I did some research.

09:14.311 --> 09:15.778
I looked at how much it costs
around the neighborhood

09:15.845 --> 09:16.869
and I'll tell you what.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.142
With all the upgrades we did on
this house, 295 is the least...

09:19.215 --> 09:21.080
No, Street. This is my
nest egg man.

09:21.151 --> 09:22.448
I worked really hard for this.

09:22.519 --> 09:24.248
It's his nest egg, man.
Look, QB, look,

09:24.321 --> 09:26.016
if we have to reduce price,
we're dead in the water.

09:26.089 --> 09:27.488
The longer we hold on
to this place,

09:27.557 --> 09:28.717
the longer we're paying for it.

09:28.792 --> 09:31.124
Now we're stepping up to the
plate and you want to just wimp out?

09:31.194 --> 09:32.286
Throw down your bat
and go home?

09:32.362 --> 09:34.523
Take the bare minimum?
No, that's not what we're here for.

09:34.598 --> 09:38.158
We did this to make money.
295. We set the price there.

09:38.233 --> 09:39.825
And we will get that price,
all right?

09:39.902 --> 09:41.426
All right.
Trust me.

09:41.503 --> 09:42.731
I'm in.

09:42.938 --> 09:44.166
All right.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.000
Thank you all for coming down.

09:46.075 --> 09:47.975
I know it's last minute
but I just felt like we needed

09:48.043 --> 09:51.672
to take this opportunity to sit down
and talk about what's been going on

09:51.747 --> 09:53.271
with Jamarcus.

09:53.349 --> 09:55.874
Boy can't sit still
to save his life.

09:56.151 --> 09:58.847
What is wrong with you?
I don't know, sir.

09:58.921 --> 10:01.048
Well, I just think
that we need to sit down

10:01.123 --> 10:04.183
and kind of make a plan so that we can
make sure that this kind of incident

10:04.259 --> 10:05.248
doesn't happen again.

10:05.327 --> 10:07.261
Principal Taylor,
I have got six kids.

10:07.329 --> 10:09.661
Now, I know how to handle Jamarcus.
He'll be punished.

10:09.732 --> 10:12.758
Okay, well, I'm afraid the next
time something like this happens

10:12.835 --> 10:15.530
the next step is
going to be suspension.

10:15.637 --> 10:17.764
And you know, that's going to
take away from the academics.

10:17.839 --> 10:20.364
Certainly going to miss some football
games, which I know you don't want...

10:20.441 --> 10:22.432
Games?
What are you talking about?

10:22.510 --> 10:25.206
You don't know
Jamarcus is a Panther?

10:29.050 --> 10:31.848
Hey, tomorrow I was
thinking maybe we could

10:32.654 --> 10:35.521
just rent some canoes or some
kayaks and just paddle on

10:35.590 --> 10:38.684
down to the falls.
How does that sound? Sound good?

10:38.760 --> 10:40.455
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:40.528 --> 10:42.155
Hello, back there.
What?

10:42.230 --> 10:44.528
Buddy? Would you
turn that off, please?

10:46.034 --> 10:48.525
Tabitha, could you please stop
texting for just a minute, honey,

10:48.603 --> 10:50.434
so we could talk or something.

10:50.538 --> 10:54.064
I mean, why don't we have a little
sing along like we used to?

10:54.141 --> 10:56.166
You want to have a
family sing along? Yeah.

10:56.243 --> 10:57.301
Count me out.

10:57.377 --> 10:59.106
Tabitha, you used to
love to sing, honey.

10:59.179 --> 11:01.010
Well, I used to not have pubic
hair either, but things changed.

11:01.081 --> 11:02.070
Whoa!
Tabby.

11:02.149 --> 11:04.083
Pubic hair is not a swear.
Yeah, but it's gross.

11:04.151 --> 11:06.517
It's TMI for the old dad, okay?

11:06.586 --> 11:07.610
Dad, I got to go pee.

11:07.688 --> 11:08.780
Kevin says we shouldn't be
ashamed of our...

11:08.855 --> 11:11.187
Tabby, shut up. No one wants
to hear about your pubic hair.

11:11.258 --> 11:12.418
Amen to that.

11:12.492 --> 11:13.823
Dad, seriously,
gas station, something.

11:13.894 --> 11:15.987
If you really want
me to, I'll censor myself.

11:16.063 --> 11:18.861
For a second there, I forgot that
I was back in fascist Texas.

11:20.634 --> 11:22.033
Oopsy daisy.

11:22.436 --> 11:24.529
Dad, can I have some money?

11:24.705 --> 11:26.673
Yeah. Imagine that.

11:28.041 --> 11:30.736
Come on. Here you go.
Yeah. You're welcome.

11:31.977 --> 11:33.672
Dad, are you okay?

11:34.980 --> 11:36.072
Yeah.

11:37.283 --> 11:39.649
It's just great
having them back.

11:39.885 --> 11:41.648
They'll come around.

11:43.923 --> 11:45.015
Yeah.

11:45.224 --> 11:47.192
You want anything from inside?

11:47.259 --> 11:49.022
Tums.
Tums?

11:49.795 --> 11:50.921
Okay.
Thanks, baby.

11:50.996 --> 11:52.361
You got it.

12:02.141 --> 12:03.540
Hey.
Hey.

12:03.609 --> 12:05.634
How're you doing?
I'm fine.

12:06.644 --> 12:09.670
Jamarcus Hall set Bree
Hudson's hair on fire today.

12:09.748 --> 12:10.874
Mac told me. I know.

12:10.949 --> 12:14.544
Well, the thing is, that when his
parents came in for the conference...

12:14.619 --> 12:15.779
Light her hair on fire.

12:15.854 --> 12:19.255
It was discovered that he never told
them that he's playing football.

12:19.324 --> 12:21.986
He forged their signature
on the permission slip

12:22.060 --> 12:24.654
and they are
pulling him off the team.

12:26.631 --> 12:28.189
Tami, what did you do?

12:28.266 --> 12:30.029
What do you mean, what did I do?
I mean, what did you do?

12:30.101 --> 12:31.864
What do you mean, "They are
pulling him off the team"?

12:32.437 --> 12:35.600
Well, hon, they did not know
he was playing football.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.106
He forged their signature
on the permission slip.

12:37.175 --> 12:40.872
Honey, before you discipline one of
my players I need to know about this.

12:40.945 --> 12:44.436
Honey, why in the world am I going
to let you know about the fact

12:44.515 --> 12:47.848
that I've got to deal with a disciplinary
situation with Jamarcus Hall?

12:47.918 --> 12:50.216
Because I'd like to be part
of that process. That's why.

12:50.287 --> 12:53.256
Why? Because if I don't have
my fullback on Friday night,

12:53.323 --> 12:54.312
I am screwed.

12:54.391 --> 12:57.451
Therefore, I'm telling you I should
have been part of that process.

12:57.528 --> 13:01.624
Well, honey, I'm telling you there's not
a thing you could've done about it.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.359
Whether you were
part of it or not.

13:03.433 --> 13:06.266
Well, that's just great.
That and a dime will get me a cup of coffee,

13:06.336 --> 13:07.997
won't it?
Hey, Mac!

13:09.273 --> 13:11.036
That's the green house
on the right.

13:11.108 --> 13:12.473
Yes, this is it.

13:17.281 --> 13:18.873
Do you want to come in,
or something?

13:18.949 --> 13:22.384
Oh, I just figured that we could hang
out here and talk for a little while.

13:22.451 --> 13:23.713
Oh, okay.

13:24.287 --> 13:28.018
We could talk about our band,
because it's really cool.

13:28.791 --> 13:31.385
I think our band is pretty cool.
Me too.

13:31.460 --> 13:35.191
I'm liking the way everything sounds.
I think you're doing great.

13:35.832 --> 13:38.426
Thank you. I know it's hard to
come into, you know, a new...

13:38.501 --> 13:42.995
A new band and try to fit in, but I think
you're doing, you know, a good job.

13:44.106 --> 13:48.270
Thank you. It's fun.
I think that's probably why.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.836
Yeah?

13:50.279 --> 13:51.644
Definitely.

14:09.397 --> 14:10.625
Well...

14:11.566 --> 14:13.329
Thank you for the ride.

14:13.401 --> 14:14.732
Okay.
Okay.

14:14.803 --> 14:17.397
All right.
We'll see you later.

14:25.046 --> 14:26.308
Set, hut!

14:29.517 --> 14:30.916
There it is.

14:33.889 --> 14:35.822
Go, Riggins, a spoke, a spoke.

14:35.890 --> 14:38.586
Hey, Riggins, just bring it a
little more towards me next time.

14:40.427 --> 14:41.553
Take it out. Let's go.

14:41.629 --> 14:43.597
There it is.
Right there.

14:44.732 --> 14:46.700
Tighten up, J.D.
Concentrate. Let's go!

14:46.767 --> 14:48.758
Listen, I got to get right
back to you on this, okay?

14:48.836 --> 14:50.064
Jason,
how're you doing?

14:50.137 --> 14:51.331
Hey, Coach.

14:51.405 --> 14:53.032
Mac get you out here
filming something for us?

14:53.107 --> 14:54.631
Oh, no, sir.
I'm out here for Riggins.

14:54.708 --> 14:57.404
I'm going to try to put a little highlight
reel together for him, for college.

14:57.478 --> 14:59.412
J. D! Get over here.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.469
J.D. throw the ball,
let's go.

15:00.547 --> 15:02.845
J.D. get over.
Coach, just one second, sir.

15:02.917 --> 15:05.385
Get over here.
J.D. come on.

15:05.519 --> 15:07.453
How many times
have we been over this?

15:07.521 --> 15:09.512
Hey, I'll catch you
in a few here.

15:09.590 --> 15:11.217
Okay.
J.D.

15:11.292 --> 15:13.088
It's a five-step drop.

15:13.159 --> 15:14.751
You got to release the ball
quicker, okay?

15:14.827 --> 15:16.920
Hit the first window, okay?
You know we worked on this.

15:16.996 --> 15:17.985
J.D. Let's go.

15:18.064 --> 15:19.429
Hey, just one sec.

15:19.999 --> 15:20.988
Coach, listen, I'm sorry.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.091
You know, I just saw
he was messing up.

15:22.168 --> 15:24.329
You gotta get your ass over to the stage.
You know, I got work to do.

15:24.404 --> 15:26.395
All right, I'm sorry, Coach.
We'll make sure that he is flawless

15:26.472 --> 15:27.871
on Friday night, okay?

15:28.541 --> 15:31.601
Great. I'm going to die if Danny
Erlicker sees me like this.

15:31.678 --> 15:33.976
Tabby, relax.
It's just a sprain.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.344
This is boring.
I hate camping.

15:36.416 --> 15:39.385
Oh, come on, Bud. Here.
Let me see that, baby.

15:39.452 --> 15:40.646
Let's throw the football
around a little bit.

15:40.720 --> 15:41.709
Come on.
How stupid.

15:41.788 --> 15:43.085
No, football's not stupid.

15:43.156 --> 15:45.522
I don't want to hear you talk like that, Bud.
It's not stupid.

15:45.591 --> 15:48.685
Kevin says it's the only sport
that's played here and nowhere else.

15:48.761 --> 15:50.125
I don't care
what Kevin says, okay?

15:50.195 --> 15:52.026
Let's just not talk
about Kevin, all right?

15:52.097 --> 15:55.430
We don't have to toss a
football if you don't want to.

15:57.469 --> 16:00.267
But we do have to eat
and I'm very hungry.

16:00.405 --> 16:01.838
You hungry, baby?
I'm hungry.

16:01.907 --> 16:03.101
You all hungry?

16:03.175 --> 16:05.439
I've got a very special
treat for us tonight.

16:05.510 --> 16:08.911
These are prime
Nebraska Angus Steaks.

16:09.014 --> 16:11.005
We're going to cook these babies
up and have us a great dinner.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.107
How does that sound?

16:12.184 --> 16:13.947
How many times do I have to
tell you that I am a vegan now?

16:14.019 --> 16:15.919
Tabby, knock it off.

16:15.988 --> 16:19.924
This is organic, grass-fed,
Nebraska Prime.

16:19.992 --> 16:21.857
That was slaughtered.
Yeah, it was slaughtered.

16:21.927 --> 16:23.861
And then,
what we're going to do is,

16:23.929 --> 16:25.658
we're going to say a
little prayer for the cow

16:25.731 --> 16:27.493
right before we eat it.
How does that sound.

16:27.565 --> 16:29.590
Kevin says meat is murder.

16:34.338 --> 16:37.364
Tabitha, I don't care about what
Kevin says, to tell you the truth.

16:37.441 --> 16:40.467
Kevin can tell you
all his left-wing propaganda.

16:40.544 --> 16:42.910
It's not propaganda.
It's a fact.

16:48.085 --> 16:49.712
It's a fact, huh?

16:51.555 --> 16:56.652
Listen to me, young lady,
Kevin is not your father.

16:56.727 --> 16:57.716
I'm your father.

16:57.828 --> 17:00.422
A real father wouldn't have
cheated on Mom.

17:02.133 --> 17:03.293
I wish you weren't my father.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.765
Tabby.

17:04.834 --> 17:05.892
Dad.

17:06.935 --> 17:08.836
How about the coyotes
have that right there!

17:08.905 --> 17:09.997
And you know what, young lady?

17:10.073 --> 17:12.040
I think I feel the same way
right now.

17:12.108 --> 17:14.269
I've been doing nothing
but trying to...

17:14.344 --> 17:16.608
All I've got is hate
since you'll got here.

17:16.713 --> 17:19.546
Hate from both of you.
And I'm tired of it.

17:20.683 --> 17:22.310
What's wrong with you guys?

17:22.385 --> 17:23.613
What?
What?

17:23.685 --> 17:27.816
You guys have been acting like little
brats ever since you got here.

17:32.062 --> 17:33.689
Here you guys go.

17:34.931 --> 17:38.560
And your appetizers are going
to be out very shortly. Okay?

17:39.202 --> 17:40.396
Hey.

17:40.869 --> 17:41.995
Hi.

17:42.237 --> 17:43.499
I just...

17:45.040 --> 17:48.203
I just wanted to come here and
say thanks and to let you know

17:48.277 --> 17:50.404
that you were absolutely
right about everything.

17:50.479 --> 17:53.573
I now see that we were never
supposed to be together.

17:53.649 --> 17:59.212
And I want to let you know that I've met
someone else and she is perfect for me.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.153
We're completely right
for each other.

18:01.223 --> 18:03.316
You have a girlfriend?
Yeah.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.560
Yeah.
Well, Landry, I'm...

18:08.230 --> 18:10.255
I'm really happy for you.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.430
I am, too.
And I'm happy for you.

18:14.002 --> 18:17.369
And maybe now we could
try and be friends.

18:17.439 --> 18:19.099
And if you...

18:19.173 --> 18:20.265
Yeah.

18:22.076 --> 18:23.441
I would love that.

18:23.511 --> 18:24.535
Okay.

18:25.113 --> 18:28.674
All right, well, I guess I'll
just see you around then.

18:53.474 --> 18:54.668
Dad, get in the car.

18:54.742 --> 18:55.901
Just leave me alone, Lyla.

18:55.976 --> 18:58.672
Dad, get in the car.
Let's talk about it.

18:58.879 --> 19:00.073
Please.

19:14.928 --> 19:16.919
That kind of sucked, huh?

19:18.832 --> 19:20.493
That was terrible.

19:20.967 --> 19:23.993
I acted terrible.
They deserved it.

19:29.576 --> 19:30.975
They hate me.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.476
They don't hate you.

19:32.545 --> 19:36.538
And all a man has is his children.
And they hate me.

19:36.615 --> 19:39.880
Dad, they don't hate you.
They're just being brats.

19:39.952 --> 19:43.251
They don't know what they're saying.
They don't mean it.

19:43.322 --> 19:44.721
Yes, they do.

19:46.392 --> 19:48.019
And I deserve it.

19:49.862 --> 19:51.386
I've lost them.

20:01.140 --> 20:02.903
You've still got me.

20:26.764 --> 20:28.231
Just let me do the talking.
I know what I'm doing here.

20:28.299 --> 20:29.823
Honey, I've talked
to these people.

20:29.901 --> 20:30.890
I have a relationship
with them.

20:30.969 --> 20:33.164
I understand. Would you please
just let me do the talking?

20:33.238 --> 20:34.227
Oh, yes, okay. Indeed.

20:34.305 --> 20:36.170
Malik, no running in the house.

20:36.241 --> 20:39.267
Look, it's not that we don't
appreciate your coming by,

20:39.344 --> 20:41.244
but you're going to
have to understand.

20:41.312 --> 20:43.280
We're just not football people.

20:43.348 --> 20:45.248
I'm an engineer
at the power plant.

20:45.316 --> 20:48.842
My company has moved us five
times in the last 10 years.

20:49.286 --> 20:52.187
My point being that we're
just passing through.

20:52.256 --> 20:55.350
I mean, I'm not one of your
Dillon football fanatics.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.393
Give me a chance to explain what
we do with these young men.

20:57.461 --> 20:58.450
I think you'll understand.

20:58.528 --> 20:59.586
Oh, you can explain
all you want.

20:59.663 --> 21:02.496
Football doesn't mean anything
to our family.

21:02.566 --> 21:05.831
I don't want Jamarcus wasting his
time and energy on something

21:05.902 --> 21:07.563
that's not going
to get him anywhere.

21:07.638 --> 21:09.435
He needs to be focused
on his future.

21:09.506 --> 21:11.064
Well, and Mr. Hall,
I hope you understand

21:11.141 --> 21:13.200
I couldn't agree with you more.

21:13.277 --> 21:15.302
But I'll tell you what, look,
I believe that football

21:15.379 --> 21:17.313
is about community spirit, sir.

21:17.381 --> 21:19.849
And I believe that it gives young men
a chance to be part of something...

21:19.916 --> 21:22.885
Hold it. All this time I thought
it was just a dumb game

21:22.953 --> 21:25.182
that this whole whacked-out
town is obsessed with.

21:25.254 --> 21:26.414
Well, no, sir.
I don't think so.

21:26.489 --> 21:29.049
I don't think I'd be devoting
my life to just some dumb game.

21:29.125 --> 21:32.151
Well, you know, if I can interrupt
here just for one second. Sorry.

21:32.228 --> 21:33.252
Go ahead.

21:33.329 --> 21:36.196
I really do understand that, I have to say.
It took me a long time

21:36.265 --> 21:38.130
to understand all this
fuss about football.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.998
He's very convincing about it,
but I didn't get it either.

21:41.070 --> 21:44.597
But what I do want to express
to you is, I have seen

21:44.674 --> 21:48.872
football do wonderful things for kids,
and that is because of my husband.

21:48.944 --> 21:53.643
He has a great ability to take a kid,
get him out on the football field,

21:54.016 --> 21:55.950
and inspire them
and empower them.

21:56.018 --> 21:58.282
And then that transfers over
into their lives.

21:58.354 --> 22:00.549
At school and in every way.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.852
And I think he could do that for Jamarcus.
I really do.

22:02.924 --> 22:04.915
But Mrs. Taylor,
Jamarcus lied to us.

22:04.993 --> 22:06.517
Now, he's been
lying to us all year.

22:06.594 --> 22:10.428
I understand, and I was real
concerned about that, believe me.

22:10.732 --> 22:14.395
Coach Taylor will make him regret
the day that he ever did that.

22:14.502 --> 22:18.268
Come to a game Friday night,
just one time.

22:18.406 --> 22:21.000
Just to see him out there
in his element, shining,

22:21.076 --> 22:24.807
and for him to know that you're
there supporting him in that.

22:25.413 --> 22:28.007
I feel like it might
make a difference.

22:28.550 --> 22:30.313
We'll think it over.

22:30.919 --> 22:32.853
I think that went well.

22:32.921 --> 22:35.890
Honey, you're opening
the door for me.

22:35.957 --> 22:39.084
Thank you. Oh, so sweet.
Thank you.

22:40.461 --> 22:42.588
Yes. It is.
I think it's cute.

22:42.663 --> 22:43.687
It's kind of cool.

22:43.764 --> 22:46.028
Funny, I don't really know who the guy is.
But that's okay.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.692
Hey, Devin.
Hello.

22:47.768 --> 22:48.826
How're you doing?
Good.

22:48.902 --> 22:51.871
You think maybe that you want to
hang out after band practice today?

22:51.939 --> 22:53.167
I'll talk to you later.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.229
All right.

22:54.575 --> 22:55.837
She didn't have to...

22:55.909 --> 23:00.369
I was thinking that maybe after band
practice we could go grab a bite

23:00.447 --> 23:03.905
to eat at the Knot Hole,
maybe have some cobbler.

23:03.984 --> 23:06.475
Maybe some barbeque.
Maybe... Landry?

23:07.121 --> 23:08.952
What?
I'm a lesbian.

23:10.691 --> 23:11.988
No, you're not.

23:12.059 --> 23:13.856
I'm serious. I'm gay.

23:15.129 --> 23:17.392
I like girls. Not boys.

23:18.698 --> 23:23.135
I feel like I need to tell you because
you have the wrong idea about us.

23:23.369 --> 23:28.432
That is some important information
that I'm really glad to know

23:28.508 --> 23:31.944
because I could have sworn the
other day that you kissed me back

23:32.011 --> 23:33.308
whenever I kissed you
and I thought...

23:33.379 --> 23:37.475
I didn't want to be rude, Landry,
and I thought I had to make sure.

23:38.317 --> 23:41.878
I would give it a try and I
know now that I really am.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.690
So, I really should thank you,
I guess, because...

23:45.758 --> 23:51.458
Okay, well, I'm going to have
to go and let this soak in

23:51.564 --> 23:56.967
or something because I don't know
how to react to this right now.

23:58.403 --> 24:01.338
This place would be great
for a young couple, you know.

24:01.406 --> 24:03.601
It's fully loaded.
Have you been upstairs, yet?

24:03.675 --> 24:04.699
No, not yet.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.573
So, you haven't seen
the master bedroom?

24:06.645 --> 24:07.771
No. What's in there?

24:07.879 --> 24:09.710
You got to check out
the master bath, man.

24:09.781 --> 24:13.512
I mean, that thing is huge.
Seriously, I mean you could fit two in that bath tub.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.450
With room for a third.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.110
You know what I mean?

24:17.189 --> 24:18.588
Maybe later.

24:19.224 --> 24:20.316
Hi, folks.
Hi.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.758
Good afternoon.
My name is Jason Street.

24:22.828 --> 24:24.955
Take a look at this. Take a look around.
If you have any questions,

24:25.030 --> 24:26.054
you can either come back
and find me,

24:26.131 --> 24:27.928
or Timothy, here, will be
happy to answer them for you.

24:27.999 --> 24:28.988
All right.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.296
Now, I get what you're saying but
there is a little bit of wiggle room

24:32.369 --> 24:33.358
on the price, all right?

24:33.437 --> 24:35.098
Folks, how're you doing?
Jason Street.

24:35.172 --> 24:36.161
What are we talking about,
over here?

24:36.240 --> 24:37.468
Oh, Jason,
I'm glad you came over.

24:37.541 --> 24:40.305
We're just talking about a little
bit of wiggle room on the price.

24:40.377 --> 24:43.107
That's a little bit premature.
I think 295 is pretty much the cheapest house...

24:43.180 --> 24:45.045
Well, what with
the way the market is,

24:45.115 --> 24:47.549
you know, always best to live
in reality, don't you think?

24:47.618 --> 24:49.609
We'll just take a look around.
Okay.

24:49.687 --> 24:51.917
You do that. Take your time.
I'll be right here.

24:51.989 --> 24:53.354
Yeah.
All right.

24:54.792 --> 24:57.693
What the hell is your problem?
QB, we've got to lower this price right now.

24:57.761 --> 25:00.059
House hasn't been on the
market for six hours yet.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.324
Please. We haven't even
had a nibble yet on it.

25:01.398 --> 25:02.888
I mean, seriously.
I'm talking to everybody in there

25:02.967 --> 25:05.401
and nobody's even interested.
Quit being a baby. Grow some balls, guys.

25:05.469 --> 25:08.369
Whoa. whoa. Ever since I lost my legs, I'm
a little more careful about my balls.

25:08.438 --> 25:10.929
Now let's take a vote on
reducing the price right here.

25:11.007 --> 25:11.996
I am right away.

25:12.075 --> 25:15.374
No. 295. That's it. 295.

25:15.612 --> 25:17.170
Can we be professional
at our own damn open house?

25:17.247 --> 25:19.613
What the hell, man?
We never agreed on 295.

25:19.682 --> 25:20.944
And who made you the boss,
anyway?

25:21.017 --> 25:23.110
I'm the boss because
nobody else wanted to step up.

25:23.186 --> 25:24.676
Listen here, Maverick. Okay.
So that's why I'm the boss.

25:24.754 --> 25:27.188
We cannot afford to be on hook
for this mortgage, all right?

25:27.257 --> 25:28.690
It ain't just about you
and your kid.

25:28.758 --> 25:29.782
Don't you dare
bring Noah into this.

25:29.859 --> 25:31.827
Oh, don't you bring
Noah into this.

25:31.895 --> 25:33.590
And every time there is
a decision to be made,

25:33.663 --> 25:35.654
you wave that baby around
like a gun.

25:35.732 --> 25:37.165
Oh, screw you, Herc.

25:37.233 --> 25:38.222
Guys.

25:38.301 --> 25:40.292
Screw you back, QB.
Screw you, Herc.

25:40.370 --> 25:41.837
Screw you back, QB.
Come on. You want to go?

25:41.905 --> 25:44.270
You want to bring
my family in this?

25:47.242 --> 25:50.006
A great time, actually,
to move this upstairs.

25:51.346 --> 25:53.337
Stop it.
All right, all right!

25:54.049 --> 25:55.141
Fine.

25:55.784 --> 25:57.547
Fine. Yeah, I need
the money for my family

25:57.619 --> 25:58.881
but everybody here
needs the money, all right?

25:58.954 --> 26:02.549
Billy's trying to get married.
Timmy's trying to go to school.

26:02.624 --> 26:05.115
Fine, I need the money
for my family.

26:05.193 --> 26:07.855
Erin's up in New England
right now with my kid.

26:07.930 --> 26:10.490
And her parents are putting him
in daycare which I can't afford.

26:10.566 --> 26:12.830
How am I supposed to
compete with that, Herc?

26:12.901 --> 26:16.337
I can't. We keep the price
where it is, man. Okay?

26:17.573 --> 26:20.440
We're lucky if we get $60,000 to
split between the four of us.

26:23.544 --> 26:25.569
I need that money, all right?

26:26.814 --> 26:30.341
Please, just trust me.

26:33.421 --> 26:34.820
All right, QB.

26:35.823 --> 26:37.154
Okay? Hey.

26:39.393 --> 26:40.621
All right.

26:41.429 --> 26:43.260
We'll do it your way.

26:46.367 --> 26:47.698
Thank you.

26:50.404 --> 26:51.928
Hey, Landry.

26:52.006 --> 26:56.170
I just wanted to make sure you know, in case
you need to do meetings for physics club,

26:56.243 --> 26:59.643
that the lab is not available
right now, because of the fire.

26:59.846 --> 27:02.110
We're not a
physics club anymore.

27:02.182 --> 27:03.206
Really?

27:03.283 --> 27:05.183
Yeah, you don't have to
worry about us.

27:05.285 --> 27:06.513
Good to know. All right.

27:06.620 --> 27:09.316
Mrs. Taylor,
could I ask you...

27:10.824 --> 27:13.315
Sure.
Can I talk to you for a second?

27:16.262 --> 27:19.663
I was just starting to feel
like I have some sort of

27:19.733 --> 27:25.501
repellent that repels
females away

27:25.805 --> 27:27.238
and sends them running.

27:27.307 --> 27:28.331
Mmm-hmm.

27:28.408 --> 27:32.208
I was in love with Tyra for a
long time and I chased her away

27:32.278 --> 27:34.007
and then there was
another girl.

27:34.080 --> 27:38.448
And I really chased her away.
That was a lot quicker.

27:39.485 --> 27:40.679
Here's the thing.

27:40.753 --> 27:44.883
And I know it's probably not very
easy to see this, here, in Dillon,

27:45.290 --> 27:48.487
but you are at the
beginning of your life.

27:49.294 --> 27:52.195
A lot of these football
heroes around here,

27:52.498 --> 27:55.262
they're not going to get
much further than this.

27:55.334 --> 27:57.666
But you are going to go
to some great college.

27:57.736 --> 28:00.796
You're going to have
a career that you love.

28:02.441 --> 28:06.241
And I'm telling you right now,
women are going to flock to you.

28:07.546 --> 28:09.173
I know
it's hard to believe,

28:09.248 --> 28:11.512
but that's the way
it's going to work.

28:12.184 --> 28:15.448
You're a good person and
this is just the beginning.

28:15.586 --> 28:18.953
I'm right 100% of the time.
You can ask my husband.

28:25.363 --> 28:26.762
Hi. How are you?

28:26.831 --> 28:28.264
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

28:28.599 --> 28:30.157
You look out for
number 12 out there, now.

28:30.835 --> 28:31.824
Hey!

28:33.805 --> 28:35.238
How are you?

28:45.349 --> 28:46.782
Wendell. Wendell Foley.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.318
Jason Street?

28:48.720 --> 28:49.846
What's up, baby?

28:49.921 --> 28:52.388
I thought you might be too big-time,
now that you've gone pro, to say hello

28:52.456 --> 28:53.445
to your old quarterback.

28:53.523 --> 28:56.583
Yeah, it's been a long time.
You know, when I heard, I wanted to come see you

28:56.660 --> 28:58.218
but we had Florida in
The Swamp that weekend.

28:58.295 --> 28:59.489
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.690
You know, watching the guys hand the
Gators their asses that weekend

29:01.765 --> 29:03.198
was probably the best thing
that happened to me, so...

29:03.266 --> 29:04.563
Oh, really? So what have you
been up to, man?

29:04.634 --> 29:06.431
Not much. You know,
I coached for a little bit.

29:06.503 --> 29:08.095
Coached the team,
we won a ring, you know,

29:08.171 --> 29:09.604
and I've been selling cars.

29:09.673 --> 29:11.800
I'm flipping a house
right now, you know.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.502
And, you know, I have a son.

29:13.577 --> 29:14.908
Excuse me, Jay Street.

29:14.978 --> 29:17.913
This is my man, right here.
My soon-to-be-agent. This is Grant Halbert.

29:18.014 --> 29:20.039
All you got to do is sign, baby.
We could drop the "soon to be.' '

29:20.117 --> 29:22.585
Jason was the QB of my
last two years at Dillon.

29:22.652 --> 29:25.018
To this day the best
quarterback I've ever seen.

29:25.088 --> 29:28.147
I mean he had a cannon and the best
sports mind of anybody I know.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.589
It's nice to meet you, sir.

29:29.658 --> 29:30.647
Right on, man.

29:30.726 --> 29:32.250
Played QB myself,
down the road at Westerby.

29:32.361 --> 29:34.420
Excuse me.
Oh, Westerby.

29:34.697 --> 29:36.892
A little Division II
ball after that. Yeah?

29:36.966 --> 29:38.194
You graduated and became
an agent here?

29:38.267 --> 29:41.031
I didn't have the honor to go pro,
so did the next best thing.

29:41.103 --> 29:42.593
Really?
Absolutely, man.

29:42.671 --> 29:46.266
Get to talk football all day.
Friends with some of the greatest players in the world.

29:46.342 --> 29:47.434
And the money's pretty great.

29:47.510 --> 29:49.273
Oh, so, Jay Street, I
got to go, man. Okay.

29:49.445 --> 29:50.935
It was good to see you.
You keep in touch, okay?

29:51.013 --> 29:53.243
All right.
Take it easy, all right?

29:53.616 --> 29:56.107
Price of glory, huh?
Hey, Jason, nice meeting you.

29:56.185 --> 29:58.847
If you're in the Big Apple,
ring me up.

30:02.224 --> 30:04.623
Okay, nice to meet you
Mr. Halbert.

30:09.063 --> 30:11.088
Blue 80, set, hut.

30:13.535 --> 30:15.127
J.D. McCoy
drops back.

30:15.737 --> 30:18.501
He's got a man open deep.
He lets it fly.

30:20.208 --> 30:21.300
It is too long.

30:21.376 --> 30:25.540
What are you doing, J.D.
Keep the elbow in, boy.

30:30.518 --> 30:31.507
I see him over there.

30:33.721 --> 30:37.555
It's a hand-off to Jamarcus Hall.
He finds an opening.

30:37.725 --> 30:38.749
Oh, nice...

30:39.460 --> 30:42.360
And the Panthers get a
much-needed first down.

30:42.429 --> 30:43.555
Set, hut!

30:45.399 --> 30:47.833
There he is.
There he is.

30:48.836 --> 30:51.464
And that's another
incompletion for J.D. McCoy.

30:51.538 --> 30:53.768
J.D. keep
the elbow down, boy.

30:54.174 --> 30:56.039
Just a little bit.
He only missed it by that much.

30:56.109 --> 30:58.168
I know. I know.
But he's got to keep that elbow down.

30:58.245 --> 30:59.712
We've been working on it
all week long.

30:59.780 --> 31:01.270
Oh, it's okay.

31:01.748 --> 31:03.181
Hey, the receiver
ran the wrong...

31:03.250 --> 31:06.185
Panther passing
attack finding it a tough go

31:06.253 --> 31:08.346
against this Fort Hood
secondary tonight.

31:08.455 --> 31:09.649
Set, hut!

31:14.595 --> 31:16.859
Oh, up the middle
for a nice gain.

31:16.930 --> 31:20.956
Jamarcus Hall has been the Ione
bright spot in this Panther offense.

31:42.188 --> 31:46.147
Where are you going? Get over here.
Get over here, right now.

31:47.193 --> 31:48.990
What the hell
are you doing out there?

31:49.061 --> 31:51.825
Where is your timing?
We worked on this all week.

31:51.898 --> 31:53.695
I'm sorry, sir.
You look at me when I'm talking to you.

31:53.766 --> 31:55.734
You get your head
in this game right now.

31:55.801 --> 31:57.165
Joe, I need my quarterback.

31:57.235 --> 31:58.463
Hey, I'm just...
I'm almost done.

31:58.536 --> 32:00.970
McGILL: J.D. let's go on in.
Let's go in the locker room. Let's go.

32:01.072 --> 32:02.733
What're you doing?

32:02.807 --> 32:05.799
What am I doing? I'm talking to my son.
Is that a problem?

32:05.877 --> 32:07.435
You yelling at him
is not going to help anyone.

32:07.512 --> 32:09.309
That is a family matter.
The way I talk to him...

32:09.381 --> 32:11.508
I'm not trying to get into
your family matters, Joe.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.141
But I'll ask you to give the
kid some breathing room

32:13.218 --> 32:15.152
so I can work with him.
How's that?

32:15.820 --> 32:17.845
Let's go, gentlemen.
Let's go.

32:18.490 --> 32:21.982
Listen, my old man used to love
to come and watch the games.

32:22.060 --> 32:23.527
He had great expectations
from me.

32:23.595 --> 32:27.326
Expectations that I did not live up
to and that was not easy on him.

32:27.399 --> 32:29.526
My dad, he just wants me
to do my best.

32:30.568 --> 32:31.762
He wants me to succeed.
That's all.

32:31.836 --> 32:34.235
Coach, time to get back
out there.

32:38.175 --> 32:39.437
Let's go.

32:42.212 --> 32:43.975
Listen up, gentlemen.

32:44.481 --> 32:46.108
We're going to go no huddle.

32:46.183 --> 32:48.344
We've been working on this
all damn year.

32:48.419 --> 32:50.444
Let's go out there
and play some smart football

32:50.521 --> 32:53.217
and let's not make any stupid mistakes.
What do you say?

32:53.290 --> 32:54.689
Let's go. Come on.

32:54.758 --> 32:55.952
Let's go to work.

32:56.026 --> 32:57.015
You're going to call the plays
out there.

32:57.094 --> 32:58.925
I don't want you looking
in the stands at your daddy,

32:58.996 --> 33:00.691
I don't want you to look
at the sidelines to me.

33:00.764 --> 33:01.753
You understand that?
Yes, sir.

33:01.832 --> 33:03.766
I will pull your ass
off the field if you do so.

33:03.968 --> 33:07.631
I've got all the confidence in
the world in you. Let's go.

33:12.408 --> 33:13.670
Let's go.

33:19.215 --> 33:20.944
McCoy fires
a laser to Lowe.

33:21.017 --> 33:22.848
First down, Panthers.

33:29.692 --> 33:31.455
Touchdown, Panthers.

33:33.296 --> 33:35.287
Fear not, ye faithful.

33:35.365 --> 33:37.799
This second half
has seen a resurrection

33:37.867 --> 33:40.631
of that golden arm
of J.D. McCoy.

33:43.006 --> 33:44.837
McCoy pitches to Riggins.

33:44.907 --> 33:46.898
Riggins rumbles up the middle.

33:48.043 --> 33:51.240
This Panther offense is
firing on all cylinders now.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.640
Go, J. D!

33:54.783 --> 33:56.410
It's not so bad.

34:11.099 --> 34:12.726
There we go, baby.

34:12.833 --> 34:17.533
A huge 50-yard TD
pass, and just like that,

34:17.606 --> 34:20.598
Dillon's prodigal son
has put the final nail

34:20.675 --> 34:22.505
in the Fort Hood coffin.

34:22.610 --> 34:24.101
Hello, playoffs.

34:25.012 --> 34:26.377
Well done.

34:31.485 --> 34:34.010
You did do your thing
out there. All right.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.955
Hey, man, I'm going to
catch y'all later.

34:50.670 --> 34:52.696
You looked good out there.

34:58.479 --> 34:59.468
Mom.

35:00.347 --> 35:02.974
And so we got to get on
home and get y'all to bed

35:03.049 --> 35:04.414
so that you can get
some good shut-eye,

35:04.484 --> 35:06.714
because you get the flight
early in the morning.

35:06.986 --> 35:08.681
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.

35:09.055 --> 35:11.353
Do you think maybe we could stop and
get some sundaes on the way home?

35:11.424 --> 35:13.551
I don't know about that.
That's dairy. I don't know...

35:15.628 --> 35:16.993
Oh, come on. Please.

35:17.063 --> 35:20.157
Okay, baby. Sundaes.
We'll have some sundaes.

35:20.233 --> 35:23.066
Okay? Hey, I'm going to
talk to Charlie. We'll go.

35:23.136 --> 35:24.865
Guys, thank you.

35:25.438 --> 35:27.167
I had a lot of fun.

35:28.942 --> 35:30.739
Bye. Great game!

35:30.944 --> 35:32.377
You did a great job.

35:32.445 --> 35:33.844
Where's Dad?

35:34.647 --> 35:37.810
Why isn't he here? He's always
riding home from the games with us.

35:37.884 --> 35:39.874
He's not mad at me, is he?

35:40.619 --> 35:43.213
Look. Look at me.
Will you look at me?

35:43.822 --> 35:45.949
He should be mad at himself.

35:46.225 --> 35:49.092
I've known him forever.
He just needs a little time on his own.

35:49.161 --> 35:50.651
He'll be fine.

35:52.698 --> 35:54.928
You want to go eat
some junk food?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.764
Where are we going? I don't know.
Where do you want to go?

35:58.036 --> 36:00.527
I want to get
some chili cheese fries.

36:00.606 --> 36:02.039
Okay.
Hey.

36:02.107 --> 36:03.131
Good night.
See you later.

36:03.208 --> 36:05.403
Thank you, sure.
Sounds great.

36:05.477 --> 36:07.411
All right. Yes, sir.
Goodbye.

36:07.479 --> 36:08.844
Hey, who's that?

36:08.914 --> 36:11.075
Mark Kline, First Properties.
Don't know Mark Kline.

36:11.150 --> 36:12.777
Who's Mark Kline?
Yeah, you do.

36:12.851 --> 36:14.819
He's the guy that just got us
out first offer on the house.

36:14.887 --> 36:16.081
You're kidding me.
Are you serious? No way.

36:16.155 --> 36:17.485
I'm dead serious.
No way.

36:22.460 --> 36:23.791
I think I'm okay.
Were you messing with it?

36:23.861 --> 36:25.226
No, I wasn't messing
with your guitar.

36:25.296 --> 36:27.764
I just put it down two minutes
ago and it already went out of tune.

36:27.832 --> 36:29.390
Hey, Devin.

36:29.467 --> 36:30.957
Hey.

36:32.203 --> 36:33.534
Hey.
How are you?

36:33.604 --> 36:34.798
Good.
Yeah?

36:34.872 --> 36:38.069
Hey, I'm going to go get water.
I'll be right back.

36:40.578 --> 36:42.375
Good game last night.

36:42.947 --> 36:44.574
That's funny.
Yeah.

36:45.516 --> 36:46.505
Um...

36:48.319 --> 36:51.550
I don't want things to be weird
between us because of this.

36:51.622 --> 36:55.853
Totally not going to be weird.
I'm sorry about everything.

36:56.660 --> 36:58.924
It was my fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.

36:58.995 --> 37:00.587
You're just being
honest with me.

37:00.664 --> 37:02.859
And trust me I appreciate that.

37:02.933 --> 37:06.300
But I just want to make sure
that you're okay with...

37:07.404 --> 37:09.429
With the secret, I guess.

37:10.473 --> 37:13.874
I'm absolutely fine with it.
I think that it's great.

37:13.944 --> 37:17.778
And I think that we should
play some music.

37:18.148 --> 37:20.548
But you don't have anything
to be worried about.

37:20.650 --> 37:21.844
Okay.
All right?

37:21.918 --> 37:24.682
Yeah, but I don't want to play that
song that we were playing earlier,

37:24.754 --> 37:27.723
because I'm going to slit my
wrists if we play that anymore.

37:51.113 --> 37:55.743
I know a girl who
she thinks of ghosts

37:56.252 --> 38:00.586
She'll make ya breakfast
She'll make ya toast

38:01.257 --> 38:05.751
She don't use butter
She don't use cheese

38:06.495 --> 38:10.294
She don't use jelly
or any of these

38:10.365 --> 38:15.234
She uses...
Vaseline

38:16.271 --> 38:20.002
Vaseline

38:24.779 --> 38:26.303
What?

38:26.381 --> 38:27.541
I mean, it burned...
Hey guys.

38:27.615 --> 38:29.446
Like fire but not like Tabasco sauce.
Hey, guys.

38:29.517 --> 38:30.575
Do you want to hold?

38:30.652 --> 38:31.744
Sorry, I'm late.
All right.

38:31.819 --> 38:34.287
Family getting along together.
Finally.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.016
We got a little something
that we want to show you guys.

38:36.090 --> 38:38.490
Can we watch it now?
Yeah, you hit the lights and just turn it on.

38:38.559 --> 38:39.548
Let's go.
Let's go, Billy. Shut up.

38:39.627 --> 38:40.855
Good?
Great.

38:40.928 --> 38:42.020
And you?
I'm great.

38:42.096 --> 38:43.688
What are we watching, sorry?

38:43.765 --> 38:47.029
"Tim Riggins goes to college.' '
On the field highlights."

38:47.100 --> 38:48.499
It's not all of them.
Here we go.

38:48.568 --> 38:50.160
All right, what...
Shh. Shh.

38:51.471 --> 38:53.132
Looks good.
Good job.

38:53.206 --> 38:56.403
All right. So you see, we
spotlight you every play.

38:59.613 --> 39:01.911
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Six guys to bring him down.

39:01.982 --> 39:04.280
Nice. JASON: Typical
Tim Riggins style.

39:06.053 --> 39:07.680
Here you go, gets a corner.
Speed, speed, speed.

39:07.754 --> 39:10.245
Gets a corner. Then power.
Then power.

39:10.324 --> 39:12.053
The guy looked like LaRon
Landry gettin' run over

39:12.125 --> 39:13.353
by Brandon Jacobs.
I remember this one.

39:13.427 --> 39:15.156
Oh dude, I remember this one.
This is my favorite one.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.253
Talk about delivering hits,
watch this one.

39:18.899 --> 39:20.161
Look how quick he gets up.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.258
We got about two more years of
footage to go through, so...

39:22.335 --> 39:23.962
What single
characteristic do you think

39:24.036 --> 39:25.469
defines Tim Riggins
as a football player?

39:25.538 --> 39:26.766
Coach.

39:29.442 --> 39:30.773
Toughness.

39:32.211 --> 39:37.342
I've never seen a kid with more
fortitude than Tim Riggins.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.645
No fear.

39:41.020 --> 39:44.854
What's your favorite memory
of your brother playing football?

39:49.495 --> 39:52.259
Watch him get that
ring back in '06.

39:52.398 --> 39:56.357
After all we've been through
together, to see him win state,

39:56.435 --> 40:00.393
that was probably the
happiest day of my life.

40:00.472 --> 40:02.667
I'm just really proud of him.

40:05.410 --> 40:07.708
Nice. LYLA: Jason,
that was really nice.

40:07.779 --> 40:09.576
All right.
Wow, yeah.

40:09.781 --> 40:12.443
Tim, I think you might
actually go to college.

40:13.585 --> 40:16.053
Streeter, I want to thank you
for everything.

40:16.121 --> 40:18.749
For the house.
For everything, man.

40:19.391 --> 40:20.551
Thank you, Six.

40:20.625 --> 40:21.956
Welcome.

40:22.527 --> 40:23.516
Cheers.
Yeah, cheers.

40:23.595 --> 40:25.085
Cheers.

40:25.296 --> 40:27.389
Cheers.
To Tim going to school.

40:35.573 --> 40:36.971
Hey, you.
Hey.

40:38.075 --> 40:40.168
What're you doing out here?

40:41.145 --> 40:43.045
Nothing. Just thinking.

40:44.515 --> 40:46.642
Looking at the Dillon sky.

40:53.123 --> 40:54.351
Lyla?

40:54.425 --> 40:55.949
Yeah.

40:56.860 --> 40:59.488
You think I can make it
somewhere else?

41:00.297 --> 41:05.735
You think I could, I don't know,
be a good sports agent or...

41:07.271 --> 41:08.704
Something?

41:11.675 --> 41:12.767
What?

41:13.777 --> 41:15.505
What? Are you okay?

41:19.248 --> 41:20.715
You're leaving?

41:20.817 --> 41:22.682
No, I didn't say that.

41:23.853 --> 41:25.514
You didn't have to.

41:32.462 --> 41:35.158
I think you'd make
a great sports agent.

41:36.966 --> 41:38.524
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

41:39.202 --> 41:42.729
Yeah, yeah, you know.
You know sports. You know athletes.

41:43.372 --> 41:44.862
You're smart.

41:45.274 --> 41:47.435
You're a great negotiator.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.074
I think you'd be
a great sports agent.

41:55.083 --> 41:56.482
I really do.

42:02.691 --> 42:03.749
Thank you.

42:04.593 --> 42:06.060
You're going?

42:07.529 --> 42:09.224
I think I have to.

42:09.698 --> 42:11.529
I think once the money clears
I'm going to go to New York

42:11.600 --> 42:13.329
and get a new job.

42:13.735 --> 42:15.396
That's a big deal.

42:15.971 --> 42:17.598
Start a new life.

42:21.176 --> 42:23.007
I think that's great.
