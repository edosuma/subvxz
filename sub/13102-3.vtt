00:04.042 --> 00:05.042
[indistinct clamoring]

00:05.125 --> 00:07.250
Please, please, everyone.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.417
Listen to me.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.792
[indistinct chatter]

00:11.875 --> 00:13.083
[gavel pounding]

00:13.167 --> 00:15.167
Everyone, please.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.792
You have to understand.

00:16.875 --> 00:20.333
The Alliance is moving
as quickly as it can.

00:20.417 --> 00:23.917
You promised us technological
advances when we joined you.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.250
They're coming.

00:25.333 --> 00:26.625
As soon as all your governments

00:26.708 --> 00:28.208
sign The Declaration
Of Principles.

00:28.292 --> 00:30.625
You have agreed to abide
by everything else.

00:30.708 --> 00:32.583
'Why can't you sign
the declaration?'

00:32.667 --> 00:35.542
You cannot legislate
morality, Delenn.

00:35.625 --> 00:37.708
(G'Kar)
'No, but we can
encourage others'

00:37.792 --> 00:40.292
to act with charity
toward one another.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.958
The Alliance is about
more than hardware.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.958
I would remind
the Drazi ambassador

00:45.042 --> 00:46.458
that the Centauri Republic

00:46.542 --> 00:48.500
has already signed
the declaration.

00:48.583 --> 00:50.292
And if the Centauri can sign it

00:50.375 --> 00:51.458
anybody can sign it.

00:51.542 --> 00:52.958
That's right..
Wait a minute.

00:53.042 --> 00:55.125
The Drazi have always respected

00:55.208 --> 00:57.208
the rights of our
neighboring worlds.

00:57.292 --> 00:59.167
We have never enslaved a race

00:59.250 --> 01:01.542
'or exploited another race.'

01:01.625 --> 01:02.833
'We do not need others'

01:02.917 --> 01:04.958
'to teach us morality.'

01:05.042 --> 01:06.917
'The Drazi refuse to sign'

01:07.000 --> 01:09.542
'because we do not
to sign.'

01:09.625 --> 01:11.167
'Who stands with us?'

01:11.250 --> 01:12.708
[indistinct chatter]

01:12.792 --> 01:14.125
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.708
Everyone, please listen.

01:36.417 --> 01:37.417
That was quite
a little circus you had

01:37.500 --> 01:40.500
goin' there, Mr. President.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.000
Londo thinks we should drop

01:42.083 --> 01:43.792
the Declaration Of Principles.

01:43.875 --> 01:45.875
Yeah, well, you gotta consider
the source, right?

01:45.958 --> 01:48.750
Mmm, G'Kar's taking it as
a personal rejection.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.208
- Since he wrote the damn thing.
- Oh, writers.

01:51.292 --> 01:53.708
They are a sensitive bunch.

01:53.792 --> 01:55.083
And Delenn?

01:55.167 --> 01:56.667
Ready to strangle someone

01:56.750 --> 01:58.458
which is saying a lot for her.

01:59.917 --> 02:01.208
So where do you stand?

02:01.292 --> 02:03.333
[sighs]

02:03.417 --> 02:05.833
I hate to say it,
but I'm with Londo.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.792
This isn't the time
to start legislating

02:07.875 --> 02:09.708
morality or ethics, fairness..

02:09.792 --> 02:12.375
Hell, we've been working on that
one for over 6,000 years.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.792
You're not gonna settle it now.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.500
If we don't make it clear
what we stand for

02:15.583 --> 02:17.542
right from the start, then we
don't stand for anything.

02:19.042 --> 02:21.750
I didn't go through all this
just to make a social club

02:21.833 --> 02:23.333
or some high-tech store.

02:23.417 --> 02:25.250
- This is about something.
- I'm not arguin'.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.667
I'm just sayin'
this isn't the right time.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.208
Right now, we should be
concentrating

02:29.292 --> 02:31.208
on more concrete issues.

02:31.292 --> 02:33.208
Now, call me a warmonger
if you like

02:33.292 --> 02:34.875
or slightly to the right
of Attila The Hun

02:34.958 --> 02:37.708
but as your duly appointed
director of covert activities

02:37.792 --> 02:39.750
I'd like to see a little less
of the touchy-feely

02:39.833 --> 02:42.167
and a little more of the iron
fist than the velvet glove.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.958
These people respect strength,
nothing else.

02:45.042 --> 02:46.792
That's exactly the problem.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.750
We have to get them
to think in other terms.

02:49.833 --> 02:50.917
In time.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.500
But for now,
you have to get their attention

02:52.583 --> 02:54.833
and prove to them that
we're a power to contend with.

02:54.917 --> 02:57.458
And then you can send them
the roses and the chocolates.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.042
'Look, John..'

02:59.125 --> 03:01.625
...I'm not trying to tell
you how to run your empire.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.542
Hell, I can hardly
even organize my socks.

03:04.625 --> 03:07.083
But this alliance of yours
is at a very critical stage.

03:07.167 --> 03:08.583
It's still an infant..

03:08.667 --> 03:11.250
And it's gonna stand or fall
depending on what you do

03:11.333 --> 03:12.750
over the next six months.

03:12.833 --> 03:14.917
Now, sooner or later, you're
gonna have to use force

03:15.000 --> 03:16.917
to make this thing work.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.750
If I were you,
I'd be spending my time

03:18.833 --> 03:21.000
contemplating that nasty reality

03:21.083 --> 03:23.000
and let morality
take care of itself.

03:24.458 --> 03:26.917
You came all the way out
here just to depress me?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.417
No. I can do that anytime.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.583
I had a couple of ideas
I wanted to run by you.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.625
But you've got enough
to think about.

03:33.708 --> 03:34.792
It can wait.

03:34.875 --> 03:37.125
Will it depress me?

03:37.208 --> 03:39.208
Probably.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.375
[explosions]

04:03.667 --> 04:05.458
[infant crying]

04:11.875 --> 04:13.875
Merkat?

04:17.583 --> 04:19.500
Merkat..

04:19.583 --> 04:20.792
He is here.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.833
They have come.

04:22.917 --> 04:24.750
He is a ranger.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.667
'He will help us, Merkat.'

04:27.833 --> 04:29.500
'He will take word
of our situation'

04:29.583 --> 04:31.708
'to the Alliance at Babylon 5'

04:31.792 --> 04:33.500
and they will come.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.042
They will fight for us

04:35.125 --> 04:37.875
and they will save us.

04:37.958 --> 04:39.625
They must save us.

04:39.708 --> 04:42.167
We have no other hope.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.833
(Kosh)
And so it begins..

04:46.917 --> 04:49.208
- There is a hole in your mind.
- What do you want?

04:49.292 --> 04:51.833
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.750
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.583
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.792
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld..

04:57.875 --> 04:59.375
I see a great hand.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.542
Reaching out of the stars.

05:00.625 --> 05:01.958
Who are you?

05:02.042 --> 05:04.375
President Clark signed
a decree today..

05:04.458 --> 05:07.250
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

05:07.333 --> 05:08.625
Unless your people get off
their encounter suited butts

05:08.708 --> 05:09.667
and do something..

05:09.750 --> 05:10.958
You're the one who was.

05:11.042 --> 05:13.958
If you go to Z'Ha'dum,
you will die.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.458
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

05:15.542 --> 05:17.333
Do you have anything
worth living for?

05:17.417 --> 05:19.208
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

05:19.292 --> 05:20.792
(Sheridan)
Like giants
in the playground..

05:20.875 --> 05:22.542
Now, get the hell
out of our galaxy!

05:22.625 --> 05:25.083
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

05:25.875 --> 05:28.667
[theme music]

06:01.125 --> 06:03.167
[music continues]

06:16.500 --> 06:18.000
(Delenn)
'And the Abbai delegation
says they will be willing'

06:18.083 --> 06:19.333
'to join the Alliance'

06:19.417 --> 06:20.875
'if they can be guaranteed
food shipments'

06:20.958 --> 06:22.458
'during their winter months.'

06:22.542 --> 06:23.958
Apparently, they have
had trouble

06:24.042 --> 06:25.667
with the weather,
leading to crop shortages.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.958
Why not just sell them
weather-control technology?

06:29.042 --> 06:30.833
We do not sell. We give.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.458
And that doesn't address
their immediate concern.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.458
What about the Pak'ma'ra?

06:35.542 --> 06:38.458
They have an outpost just
a couple of jumps from there.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.542
An agricultural colony.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.375
It produces far more food
than they need.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.083
Maybe they can help.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.208
G'Kar..

06:46.375 --> 06:48.167
- Ahem.
- G'Kar?

06:48.250 --> 06:50.042
Hmm? Oh, sorry. I..

06:50.125 --> 06:53.750
I was modifying clause 12 in
the Declaration Of Principles.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.583
I was thinking that
if I could make it

06:55.667 --> 06:57.667
more linguistically suitable
to the Drazi

06:57.750 --> 06:59.333
they might be open
to signing it.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.000
Great maker, I need a drink.

07:01.083 --> 07:04.250
Well, they don't like
to say "we commit" to anything.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.458
They prefer "the universe

07:06.542 --> 07:08.167
through us agrees to."

07:08.250 --> 07:09.500
Make that two drinks.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.167
Somehow, G'Kar, I don't think

07:11.250 --> 07:13.250
a rewrite will solve
the problem.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.167
We may be able to get
the Pak'ma'ra on board to help.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.833
But they are going to
need something in exchange.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.000
Oh. Offer them my body.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.417
Another ten minutes of this

07:21.500 --> 07:22.833
I'll be dead anyway.

07:22.917 --> 07:24.042
I second the motion.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.167
- 'G'Kar--'
- Just a moment.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.000
My muse is speaking to me.

07:30.083 --> 07:34.125
Alright, while we're waiting for
G'Kar's muse to finish up

07:34.208 --> 07:35.750
'I believe Mr. Garibaldi'

07:35.833 --> 07:38.000
'has some business he'd like
to put before us.'

07:38.083 --> 07:39.500
'Michael?'

07:39.583 --> 07:41.708
Couple of weeks back, after they
saved your life, Mr. President

07:41.792 --> 07:44.000
you gave a small colony
of telepaths permission

07:44.083 --> 07:45.667
to take up residence
here on the station.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.208
At the time, they said
they were willing

07:47.292 --> 07:48.417
to work to earn their keep.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.667
I may have a solution.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.375
Go on.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.083
I've been collating the latest
reports from the rangers

07:54.167 --> 07:56.500
and while they're all very
thorough and very considering

07:56.583 --> 07:58.333
they could be better,
more complete.

07:58.417 --> 08:02.042
How? They use every available
means of gathering information.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.250
Not every means.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.708
I think I know
where this is going.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.958
I want permission to use
some of these telepaths

08:09.042 --> 08:11.333
to gather covert intelligence
on our behalf.

08:11.417 --> 08:13.625
Now, there are rules against
that sort of thing, Michael.

08:13.708 --> 08:15.625
Yeah, that's right, that's
right. Psi-Corps rules.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.625
But who in this room supports
the Psi-Corps anyway?

08:17.708 --> 08:20.708
And besides, the rules
apply only to human telepaths.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.750
Minbari telepaths
can do whatever they want.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.292
The Centauri have been
using military

08:24.375 --> 08:25.667
Teeps for over 300 years.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.042
Every race, except
ours and the Narns

08:28.125 --> 08:29.917
use telepaths in some
kind of military

08:30.000 --> 08:31.250
or intelligence capability.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.750
And the only reason
the Narns don't do it

08:32.833 --> 08:34.417
is because they don't have any
natural-born Teeps.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.333
- No offense.
- None taken.

08:36.417 --> 08:38.292
Now, look, I know
you have reservations.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.875
I'm not big
on telepaths myself.

08:40.958 --> 08:42.458
I'm not big on guns either.

08:42.542 --> 08:44.250
But if everyone else has them,
I want to make sure

08:44.333 --> 08:46.542
I can get my hands
on the biggest one I can.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.083
So why do we wanna
handicap ourselves

08:48.167 --> 08:49.625
when everyone else is doing it?

08:49.708 --> 08:50.917
These people are on the run.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.583
We provided them
with food, clothing

08:52.667 --> 08:54.792
a-a-a place for meeting
more of their own kind.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.917
Michael, we know
there is a crisis coming

08:57.000 --> 08:59.292
between normals and telepaths.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.917
I let them aboard figuring
that we could keep them

09:02.000 --> 09:03.792
in our back pocket
until they were needed.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.417
And all I'm saying is,
let's move 'em to

09:05.500 --> 09:07.375
the front pocket instead
of the back pocket.

09:07.458 --> 09:09.792
Let's put 'em to use now instead
of waiting till the last moment.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.792
If they want to work, I say,
great, here's a chance.

09:12.875 --> 09:15.375
'Alright, look, this may be
a moot point anyway.'

09:15.458 --> 09:16.458
They may say no.

09:16.542 --> 09:17.458
All I want is permission

09:17.542 --> 09:18.667
to have the conversation.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.292
They say no,
end of discussion.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.292
They say yes, we can vote on it.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.667
'Call it a fact-finding
mission.'

09:24.750 --> 09:26.375
Nothing wrong
with facts, is there?

09:26.458 --> 09:28.500
Never met a fact yet
I didn't like.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.958
Alright, alright..

09:31.042 --> 09:33.792
I suppose there's no harm in
just having a conversation.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.042
Go on. But don't commit us
to anything.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.958
Done. I'll be in touch.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.875
You've misspelled this.

09:41.958 --> 09:43.458
There's no "Y" in liberties.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.500
Oh, go away.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.958
Repress someone else.

09:46.042 --> 09:48.042
As you wish.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.375
I..

10:10.000 --> 10:11.542
Afternoon.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.708
I'm looking for a guy
named Byron.

10:13.792 --> 10:15.708
I hear he's kind of
in charge around here.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.708
Okay. Let's try this
again, shall we?

10:21.792 --> 10:24.125
Now, I'm here on behalf
of President Sheridan.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.333
You know, the guy who
lets you live here

10:26.417 --> 10:28.708
and eat here and..

10:31.667 --> 10:34.167
...whatever here.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.500
Anyway..

10:35.583 --> 10:36.833
If you're not gonna cooperate

10:36.917 --> 10:38.208
then I'm gonna have to tell him
that you're just

10:38.292 --> 10:39.708
being downright unfriendly.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.708
Afternoon. My name's
Michael Garibaldi--

10:53.792 --> 10:55.042
Yes, it is.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.833
And the answer is "no".

10:57.917 --> 11:00.500
Wait a second. You didn't
hear what I had to say.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.667
Yes, I did.
I heard your proposition.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.708
I heard what you thought I would
probably say in response

11:06.792 --> 11:09.667
and I heard the counter
arguments you planned to use.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.958
I know you're having some
discomfort with those shoes

11:12.042 --> 11:15.417
and that lunch is not sitting
well with you just now.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.750
Not big on privacy, are you?

11:17.833 --> 11:19.458
- I did nothing.
- Wait a--

11:19.542 --> 11:21.125
Do you know
what a telepath has to do

11:21.208 --> 11:24.333
in order to avoid
picking up stray thoughts?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.917
We have to kick down
our natural abilities.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.500
Run rhymes and little songs
through our heads.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.417
Round and round.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.125
All that to keep from picking up

11:33.208 --> 11:35.125
what you're broadcasting
loud enough to be heard

11:35.208 --> 11:36.750
halfway down the hall.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.125
You're one of those people

11:38.208 --> 11:40.917
who rehearses everything,
Mr. Garibaldi.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.292
You never enter a situation
until you've gone

11:43.375 --> 11:45.917
over it and over it
a hundred times.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.583
Worked out what you will say.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.083
What the other person will say.

11:49.167 --> 11:52.917
How you'll respond.
It's...quite remarkable.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.167
And extremely depressing.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.625
That little personality quirk

11:59.708 --> 12:02.875
must have cost you more
than a few relationships.

12:02.958 --> 12:05.875
Mundanes want us to fill our
heads with noise and babble

12:05.958 --> 12:07.292
so we won't hear
what you're shouting

12:07.375 --> 12:09.500
at the top of your minds.

12:09.583 --> 12:12.292
I didn't need
to scan you, Mr. Garibaldi.

12:12.375 --> 12:14.792
And even if I did,
since you were here to ask us

12:14.875 --> 12:16.958
to do the same to others
on your behalf..

12:17.042 --> 12:19.125
...you do not exactly
have the moral high ground

12:19.208 --> 12:20.750
to complain, now, do you?

12:20.833 --> 12:23.375
You said you wanted to
work to earn your keep.

12:23.458 --> 12:24.667
We did.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.625
We do.

12:26.708 --> 12:28.250
We will work.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.250
We will fix, sell, rent..

12:32.333 --> 12:34.375
...our services.

12:34.458 --> 12:37.708
We will do whatever
we must to survive.

12:37.792 --> 12:40.458
But we will no longer
take orders from Mundanes.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.792
Or belong to organizations
which take us in

12:42.875 --> 12:44.667
only when it is convenient.

12:44.750 --> 12:48.500
When they need us
and when they can use us.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.458
That includes Psi-Corps

12:50.542 --> 12:52.000
and that includes you.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.792
Good day, Mr. Garibaldi.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.292
[whirring]

13:09.375 --> 13:10.417
(male #1)
White Star 90.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.333
Requesting emergency docking.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.042
Medical assistance needed.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.042
(woman over PA)
'Trauma team to Medlab one.'

13:17.125 --> 13:18.417
- How is he?
- 'Not good.'

13:18.500 --> 13:20.250
'Multiple fractures,
lost a lot of blood.'

13:20.333 --> 13:21.708
'I think he's in shock.'

13:21.792 --> 13:23.542
Let's go, people!
Let's move! Let's move now!

13:23.625 --> 13:24.875
'Come on! Bring it in!'

13:24.958 --> 13:27.667
- 'Bring it in.'
- 'Go bring me isolab..'

13:27.750 --> 13:29.875
Listen, you've got to help 'em.

13:29.958 --> 13:31.792
- They're all gonna die.
- I understand.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.125
You got to help them.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.625
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

13:35.708 --> 13:37.708
That's it.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.208
Can you do anything
for him, Steven?

13:48.292 --> 13:49.625
Anything at all?

13:49.708 --> 13:51.042
I've done everything
I can, Delenn.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.542
The ship was shot to hell.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.208
Computer systems down,
long range comm-systems dead.

13:56.292 --> 13:58.000
Life support non-existent.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.750
It's a miracle
he got here in one piece.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.458
He's in a deep coma

14:02.542 --> 14:05.125
and the damage
is just too severe.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.167
At most, I'd say
he has a few hours.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.333
Were you able to find out

14:09.417 --> 14:10.750
why he was coming here?

14:10.833 --> 14:13.083
No. He passed out before
he could say anything.

14:13.167 --> 14:14.250
One thing's for sure, though.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.667
Somebody wanted to stop him

14:15.750 --> 14:17.292
from getting here alive.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.708
If we do not find out

14:18.792 --> 14:20.583
then his death
will be meaningless.

14:20.667 --> 14:24.167
And whoever did this will be
allowed to escape justice.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.042
We need a telepath. Quickly.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.000
It won't be
admissible in court.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.292
There are
higher courts, Stephen.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.292
Surely, we will find
justice in one of them.

14:41.958 --> 14:44.000
[intense music]

15:03.000 --> 15:05.125
(Verchan)
They must save us.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.375
We have no other hope.

15:07.458 --> 15:10.000
Our world has many resources

15:10.083 --> 15:13.542
other races might
find valuable.

15:13.625 --> 15:15.500
We kept this to ourselves

15:15.583 --> 15:17.500
because we do not
have the capacity

15:17.583 --> 15:19.167
to defend ourselves from those

15:19.250 --> 15:22.125
who would take them from us.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.625
Ten years ago

15:23.708 --> 15:26.500
the raiders fell upon us.

15:26.583 --> 15:27.875
They came in great ships

15:27.958 --> 15:29.667
and destroyed our cities.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.583
Our fields.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.667
They imprisoned
and killed our leaders.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.500
They come twice each year

15:37.583 --> 15:38.833
and take what they want

15:38.917 --> 15:40.333
leaving us with barely

15:40.417 --> 15:42.542
'enough to survive.'

15:42.625 --> 15:44.042
'We cannot beat them.'

15:44.125 --> 15:47.125
'But we have chosen to fight.'

15:47.208 --> 15:49.417
'This time, we have said "no"!'

15:50.625 --> 15:52.625
'We have hidden away everything'

15:52.708 --> 15:54.542
'they would take from us.'

15:54.625 --> 15:57.750
'And their anger
has been terrible.'

15:57.833 --> 16:00.042
[explosion]

16:00.125 --> 16:04.708
We wish to join
your new alliance.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.542
What others
have taken by force

16:06.625 --> 16:08.917
we wish to give freely

16:09.000 --> 16:11.292
to your cause.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.208
In 12 days

16:13.292 --> 16:15.708
they will come by force.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.542
If you come by then to help

16:17.625 --> 16:18.875
then we will live.

16:18.958 --> 16:21.042
If you do not come..

16:22.542 --> 16:24.250
...we will die.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.292
(male #1)
'I'm dying, aren't I?'

16:31.667 --> 16:33.083
Aren't I?

16:38.458 --> 16:40.042
I'm sorry.

16:44.583 --> 16:46.625
The Enfili are a good people.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.292
Decent people.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.167
Don't let them die
because I failed.

16:59.042 --> 17:00.167
Let my life..

17:01.667 --> 17:02.875
...and my death

17:02.958 --> 17:04.792
have a meaning.

17:37.083 --> 17:40.125
[ethereal music]

17:57.708 --> 17:59.417
Heart rate, respiration, zero.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.542
Brain activity, zero.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.083
He's dead.

18:07.583 --> 18:09.625
Did you get it?

18:13.917 --> 18:17.000
(Delenn)
'Lyta says
they're called Enfili.'

18:17.083 --> 18:19.458
'Their world is located
on the edge of Drazi space.'

18:19.542 --> 18:21.958
'But the Drazi have never
claimed it as a protectorate.'

18:22.042 --> 18:24.083
Never shown much interest
in the outer territories.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.583
So they are on their own

18:27.667 --> 18:30.500
unless we help them out.

18:30.583 --> 18:32.583
Which means getting
into a firefight.

18:35.042 --> 18:37.167
[scoffs]
Garibaldi was right.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.292
I know. I hate it
when he's right.

18:39.375 --> 18:40.542
Yeah.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.167
Well, have you spoken to Londo
or G'Kar about this?

18:43.250 --> 18:44.667
Yes.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.042
They wish this could
have come at a better time

18:47.125 --> 18:49.375
'as if there is ever
a good time for this.'

18:49.458 --> 18:52.167
But agree that
we must intervene.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.917
The Enfili have asked for
membership in the Alliance.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.583
They have asked for our help.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.208
And now, according to G'Kar's

18:58.292 --> 18:59.917
Declaration Of Principles

19:00.000 --> 19:01.750
we are obligated
to provide both.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.292
Oh, I can just hear Londo now.

19:05.375 --> 19:06.958
[imitating Londo]
I imagine you are finding your

19:07.042 --> 19:12.042
principles most
inconvenient now. Yes?

19:12.125 --> 19:14.042
He went on for
a bit longer.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.375
But that was the sense of it.

19:16.458 --> 19:19.708
Yeah. Well, he's right.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.875
Yes, this is going
to be inconvenient.

19:21.958 --> 19:25.083
Yes, I wanted
to avoid this for a while.

19:25.167 --> 19:27.333
But we knew we were gonna have
to get into it sooner or later.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.292
We may as well
get it over with now.

19:30.833 --> 19:33.000
I just wish I knew

19:33.083 --> 19:35.417
what we were getting into.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.458
Whoever's out there
bombing the Enfili

19:37.542 --> 19:39.708
they managed
to trash a White Star.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.500
That means..

19:42.583 --> 19:45.208
...superior firepower
in strength or in numbers.

19:45.292 --> 19:47.042
Or both.

19:47.125 --> 19:49.042
Yeah, thanks.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.417
So I have no idea
how many White Stars

19:51.500 --> 19:53.250
to send out there
to deal with this.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.667
Well..

19:57.750 --> 19:59.667
If you're going to make a point

19:59.750 --> 20:01.792
why not make it
so that no one misses it?

20:03.375 --> 20:04.833
Send all of them.

20:04.917 --> 20:07.083
Or at least as many
as we can afford.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.417
Dukhat once told me

20:09.500 --> 20:13.042
"If you can create sufficient
fear in your enemies

20:13.125 --> 20:15.000
"you may not
have to fight them.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.000
"Always remember that terror

20:17.083 --> 20:19.292
is also a form
of communication."

20:19.375 --> 20:21.417
Oh, he taught you well.

20:22.375 --> 20:23.500
Sheridan to C&amp;C.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.458
(male #2)
'C&amp;C. Go.'

20:25.542 --> 20:27.417
Contact the White Star fleet.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.292
Send as many as possible
to rendezvous

20:30.375 --> 20:32.000
at a staging area in sector

20:32.083 --> 20:35.000
'500 by nine by 13.'

20:35.083 --> 20:37.125
(male #2)
'Confirmed.
What's the mission?'

20:37.208 --> 20:38.667
The new Interstellar Alliance

20:38.750 --> 20:40.292
fresh out of its crib

20:40.375 --> 20:42.583
and before its even
learned how to walk

20:42.667 --> 20:44.417
is gonna go find
the neighborhood

20:44.500 --> 20:46.417
bully and pick a fight.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.167
Then you are familiar
with the Enfili.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.625
Only distantly.

20:57.708 --> 21:00.375
They are on the furthest edge
of our territory.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.708
We have little interest
in that area.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.000
Ah, I understand.

21:04.083 --> 21:06.750
Still, I thought you should
know our intentions.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.125
These people have been
victimized by raiders

21:09.208 --> 21:11.458
and they deserve every bit of
help that we can give them.

21:11.542 --> 21:14.042
Since this encroaches
on Drazi space

21:14.125 --> 21:16.625
I wanted you to know
that we were going in

21:16.708 --> 21:18.542
and ask for your help.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.375
Here's the background
information.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.167
Of course.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.875
I will speak
with my government.

21:24.958 --> 21:27.292
If we can help, we will do so.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.542
Thank you. Thank you.

21:28.625 --> 21:30.333
We'll wait for you at
the rendezvous point

21:30.417 --> 21:32.125
for as long as we can.

21:50.958 --> 21:53.042
[indistinct chatter]

22:10.167 --> 22:11.625
Hi.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.667
I've been lookin'
all over for you.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.292
I've got a job for you.

22:16.375 --> 22:17.917
Why, I'm fine, Mr. Garibaldi.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.250
Thank you so much for asking.

22:20.333 --> 22:22.292
Uh, sorry.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.083
How ya doin'?

22:24.167 --> 22:26.583
I have had a day.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.417
I heard. Delenn told me.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.000
That's why I'm here.
I thought that--

22:30.083 --> 22:33.417
Did she tell you I was inside
his mind when he died?

22:33.500 --> 22:35.000
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

22:35.083 --> 22:37.333
Do you have any idea
what that does to you?

22:38.083 --> 22:39.750
No, not really.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.917
And do you know why?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.417
Because you're not
supposed to know.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.625
No one is supposed to know

22:45.708 --> 22:47.583
except the person who is dying.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.625
When it happens..

22:52.292 --> 22:53.417
When it happens, you see it

22:53.500 --> 22:55.958
as a door opening.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.125
Because there's no other way
for the human mind

22:58.208 --> 23:00.958
to interpret what you're seeing.

23:01.042 --> 23:03.167
You feel the other person
slipping away

23:03.250 --> 23:05.667
and for a second,
it catches you.

23:07.292 --> 23:09.292
It pulls you in.

23:09.375 --> 23:11.875
And a part of your soul
goes with him.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.458
I don't believe in souls.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.500
Call it whatever you want.

23:16.583 --> 23:19.625
But inside, in here..

23:19.708 --> 23:21.542
There's a part of you
that goes cold.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.125
Empty.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.542
And after that..

23:28.667 --> 23:30.708
...you're never
quite whole again.

23:34.750 --> 23:36.875
I've only been through it twice.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.375
I've seen other telepaths
who've been through it

23:41.458 --> 23:43.583
four or five times.

23:43.667 --> 23:45.500
And you look into their eyes..

23:47.708 --> 23:49.958
...and there's
nothing there anymore.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.500
Rumor around Psi-Corps is that's
what happened to Mr. Bester.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.167
Did you know that?

24:02.250 --> 24:03.542
No.

24:03.625 --> 24:07.167
They say he was always
volunteering for deathbed scans.

24:07.250 --> 24:10.042
I guess he wanted to know
what was on the other side.

24:10.125 --> 24:12.417
They say he was there
inside someone's mind

24:12.500 --> 24:15.833
when they died, and..

24:15.917 --> 24:18.042
...he went too deep.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.125
'Saw more than anyone
should ever see.'

24:21.625 --> 24:23.542
And when the door closed..

24:23.625 --> 24:25.625
...the rest of him..

24:25.708 --> 24:27.875
...maybe the best of him..

24:27.958 --> 24:30.042
...never came back.

24:32.792 --> 24:33.875
So, yeah, I've had a day.

24:33.958 --> 24:36.042
I've had one hell of a day.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.208
And what kind of a job

24:40.292 --> 24:42.917
would you like me to do
for you, Mr. Garibaldi?

24:44.833 --> 24:47.667
I'm putting together
a covert intelligence unit.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.042
I'd like to include a small
group of telepaths.

24:50.125 --> 24:53.417
Since we have a bunch of them
living down in Brown sector..

24:53.500 --> 24:55.000
...I went to see them.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.417
Did they tell
you they were tired

24:56.500 --> 24:58.042
of being used by Mundanes?

24:58.125 --> 24:59.625
Yes.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.500
Did they tell
you to go to hell?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.667
In so many words.

25:04.667 --> 25:06.542
Well..

25:07.458 --> 25:09.542
Then I don't see a problem.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.250
Nice talking to you, Michael.

25:11.333 --> 25:13.042
Lyta, okay, look, I know
you've had a tough day

25:13.125 --> 25:14.417
and that you're upset,
but I need you to get

25:14.500 --> 25:15.792
past that for a second.

25:15.875 --> 25:17.375
Now, all the other races
use telepaths

25:17.458 --> 25:19.417
as information-gathering
resources.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.958
We need the same
if we're gonna compete.

25:21.042 --> 25:23.500
So you want me to talk to them,
one Teep to another?

25:23.583 --> 25:24.667
Well, they'll listen to you.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.167
You're one of their kind.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.708
I'm asking you to do this
as a personal favor.

25:27.792 --> 25:30.458
If not for me,
then Sheridan, Delenn.

25:30.542 --> 25:31.833
Lyta..

25:31.917 --> 25:33.625
They believe
in this new alliance.

25:33.708 --> 25:36.000
They think they can make
a difference, help people..

25:36.083 --> 25:40.042
Me, I don't know
what to believe anymore.

25:40.125 --> 25:41.417
But they're tryin', Lyta.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.958
They're tryin' so hard
and they're gonna need

25:43.042 --> 25:45.833
all the help they can get,
whether they know it or not.

25:45.917 --> 25:47.375
Now, I came back
because I figured

25:47.458 --> 25:49.375
they deserve a fighting chance
to make this work.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.375
And I'm gonna give it to them.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.000
You do this for me,
and, I swear

25:53.083 --> 25:55.542
I will never ask
you for anything ever again.

25:58.583 --> 26:00.417
Till the next time.

26:05.667 --> 26:07.667
Alright.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.083
[sighs]

27:13.417 --> 27:15.208
[beep]

27:29.250 --> 27:30.625
(Sheridan)
'Open.'

27:59.167 --> 28:01.583
John, what are
you doing out there?

28:01.667 --> 28:03.958
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

28:04.042 --> 28:07.750
I just kept running it
all through my head.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.042
If we're doing
the right thing.

28:09.125 --> 28:11.292
I mean, we hardly
know these Enfili.

28:11.375 --> 28:13.417
I understand.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.417
What is that?

28:15.500 --> 28:17.333
It looks like
the opening of G'Kar's

28:17.417 --> 28:19.417
Declaration Of Principles.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.583
I guess he finished revising it.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.250
Read it to me.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.208
Oh, I'm not nearly as good

28:25.292 --> 28:26.833
a speaker as G'Kar is.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.750
Read it.

28:32.542 --> 28:33.750
[clearing throat]

28:33.833 --> 28:36.750
"The universe speaks
in many languages

28:36.833 --> 28:39.375
"but only one voice.

28:39.458 --> 28:40.708
"The language is not Narn

28:40.792 --> 28:42.792
"or human or Centauri

28:42.875 --> 28:45.083
"or Gaim or Minbari.

28:45.167 --> 28:48.292
(both)
"It speaks in
the language of hope.

28:48.375 --> 28:51.000
(G'Kar)
It speaks
in the language of trust.

28:51.083 --> 28:53.292
It speaks in
the language of strength

28:53.375 --> 28:55.958
and the language
of compassion.

28:56.042 --> 28:59.167
It is the language
of the heart.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.333
And the language
of the soul.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.458
But always it is
the same voice.

29:06.542 --> 29:09.000
It is the voice
of our ancestors

29:09.083 --> 29:12.250
speaking through us.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.875
And the voice of our inheritors

29:13.958 --> 29:17.083
waiting to be born.

29:17.167 --> 29:21.125
It is the small,
still voice that says

29:21.208 --> 29:22.875
"We are one."

29:22.958 --> 29:25.125
No matter the blood,
no matter the skin

29:25.208 --> 29:28.833
no matter the world,
no matter the star.

29:28.917 --> 29:31.333
We are one.

29:31.417 --> 29:33.208
No matter the pain

29:33.292 --> 29:34.667
no matter the darkness

29:34.750 --> 29:38.667
no matter the loss,
no matter the fear.

29:38.750 --> 29:41.125
We are one.

29:41.208 --> 29:43.542
Here, gathered together

29:43.625 --> 29:45.250
in common cause

29:45.333 --> 29:47.083
we agree to recognize

29:47.167 --> 29:49.583
this singular truth

29:49.667 --> 29:53.250
and this singular rule.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.875
That we must be kind
to one another.

29:56.958 --> 30:00.458
"Because each voice enriches us
and ennobles us

30:00.542 --> 30:03.583
'"and each voice lost
diminishes us.'

30:03.667 --> 30:05.708
'"We are the voice
of the universe.'

30:05.792 --> 30:07.833
'"The soul of creation'

30:07.917 --> 30:10.042
"The fire
that will light the way

30:10.125 --> 30:12.875
"to a better future.

30:12.958 --> 30:15.500
We are one."

30:17.292 --> 30:18.958
(G'Kar)
one.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.625
You're keeping us out.

30:27.708 --> 30:30.083
You're keeping all of us out.

30:30.167 --> 30:31.375
Why?

30:31.458 --> 30:34.750
I don't let anyone in anymore.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.042
Pity.

30:37.125 --> 30:40.083
- Mr. Garibaldi--
- Yes, I know, he sent you.

30:40.167 --> 30:42.833
You're used to running other
people's errands, aren't you?

30:42.917 --> 30:44.875
I can see it in your eyes..

30:44.958 --> 30:47.292
...your bearing.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.458
Here. Sit.

30:50.625 --> 30:52.250
- No!
- What are you--

30:52.333 --> 30:55.417
It was not phrased
as a request, now was it?

30:55.500 --> 30:57.417
It was phrased as an order.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.833
Sit. Stand.

30:59.917 --> 31:01.792
Roll over. Bark.

31:01.875 --> 31:03.000
Always taking orders..

31:03.083 --> 31:05.417
Running errands
for other people.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.792
Good little telepath.

31:06.875 --> 31:09.583
Good little lap dog.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.833
Has it occurred to you
that you deserve better?

31:24.958 --> 31:26.542
'Sit.'

31:27.167 --> 31:29.208
Please?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.125
It felt better, didn't it?

31:42.208 --> 31:44.292
To be asked.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.458
To have someone do for you
for a change.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.042
That's why we're here.

31:49.125 --> 31:50.667
Because we're tired
of being ordered around

31:50.750 --> 31:54.792
by those who cannot hear
the song we hear.

31:54.875 --> 31:57.375
Tired of being used
as cannon fodder.

31:57.458 --> 31:58.542
As inquisitors.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.958
As executioners
and as bloodhounds.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.667
They forget
we're human beings, too.

32:04.750 --> 32:07.417
No, not human beings. Better.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.667
That's why
they're afraid of us.

32:09.750 --> 32:12.167
It's all ego, you know.

32:12.250 --> 32:15.292
"What a piece of work is man.

32:15.375 --> 32:17.417
"How noble in reason.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.333
"How infinite in faculties.

32:19.417 --> 32:20.833
"In form and moving

32:20.917 --> 32:23.417
"how express and admirable.

32:23.500 --> 32:26.333
"In action, how like an angel.

32:26.417 --> 32:28.333
"In apprehension

32:28.417 --> 32:30.708
"how like a God.

32:30.792 --> 32:33.333
'"The beauty of the world.'

32:33.417 --> 32:35.542
'"The paragon of animals.'

32:37.417 --> 32:39.708
The paragon of animals."

32:41.750 --> 32:44.500
Six thousand years of brutality

32:44.583 --> 32:47.375
murder, and slavery.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.542
An animal does not
do this to its own kind

32:49.625 --> 32:51.542
but they do it to each other.

32:51.625 --> 32:53.375
'And they would do it to us'

32:53.458 --> 32:55.375
'unless we stop them.'

32:55.458 --> 32:57.875
Unless we find a way..

32:57.958 --> 32:59.667
...to help each other.

33:00.917 --> 33:03.667
Unless we care for one another.

33:09.792 --> 33:11.375
Tell me that it matters to you

33:11.458 --> 33:13.042
that I help your friend.

33:15.292 --> 33:17.083
[scoffs]

33:17.167 --> 33:19.500
It matters to me.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.875
Then for your sake,
I will do it.

33:23.458 --> 33:24.875
Tell your friend

33:24.958 --> 33:26.417
we will find him two among us

33:26.500 --> 33:28.833
who are trained beyond reproach.

33:28.917 --> 33:31.500
They will find for him
all the things that are hidden.

33:31.583 --> 33:34.000
All the things that are dark.

33:34.083 --> 33:36.625
And all the things
that are secret.

33:40.417 --> 33:42.458
Thank you.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.875
One more thing.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.500
A first installment
on my promise.

33:51.667 --> 33:53.375
I passed
the Drazi ambassador shortly

33:53.458 --> 33:56.083
after he finished
talking to Sheridan.

33:56.167 --> 33:59.708
He was broadcasting
his thoughts quite loudly.

33:59.792 --> 34:01.250
Tell your friend
that the White Stars

34:01.333 --> 34:02.667
they have sent
to help the Enfili

34:02.750 --> 34:04.417
are going in to a trap.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.625
In a little while,
they will all die.

34:06.708 --> 34:09.708
And all those they sought
to protect will also be dead.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.958
The Drazi were behind
the whole thing from the start.

34:15.042 --> 34:17.833
They gave the raiders guns,
ships, support, equipment

34:17.917 --> 34:19.667
and let them go after
all the independent worlds

34:19.750 --> 34:21.417
at the edge of Drazi space.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.750
In return,
the Drazi shared equally

34:23.833 --> 34:25.292
'in whatever they took.'

34:25.375 --> 34:27.083
It's a beautiful little scheme.

34:27.167 --> 34:29.125
The Drazi keep all the worlds
at their borders

34:29.208 --> 34:30.542
beaten down and submissive.

34:30.625 --> 34:31.875
Their economy
gets a periodic boost

34:31.958 --> 34:33.750
from the raiders'
attacks on the outworlds.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.583
And they get to stay
above it all.

34:35.667 --> 34:37.292
"Oh, no, no, the Drazi.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.417
We do not exploit
other worlds."

34:39.500 --> 34:41.458
Give me a break,
lying sacks of..

34:41.542 --> 34:43.333
What about the White Stars?

34:43.417 --> 34:46.333
Byron's information
is sketchy on this part.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.000
But he believes
the Drazi are gonna lead

34:48.083 --> 34:49.625
the White Stars
into an ambush

34:49.708 --> 34:52.458
guaranteeing
no further interference.

34:52.542 --> 34:54.708
Before that happens, though

34:54.792 --> 34:56.167
they're gonna hit
the Enfili homeworld

34:56.250 --> 34:57.625
'and wipe out
everything in sight'

34:57.708 --> 35:00.000
as retribution
for trying to bring us in.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.375
And kill everybody
who might know

35:01.458 --> 35:02.750
or find out
they were involved.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.500
Exactly.

35:04.583 --> 35:05.750
Michael, contact the fleet.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.583
Tell them not to wait
for the Drazi.

35:07.667 --> 35:09.708
They are to leave
the rendezvous point at once

35:09.792 --> 35:11.667
and head straight
for the Enfili homeworld.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.417
And take up
defensive positions.

35:13.500 --> 35:14.875
Maximum burn,
they have to get there

35:14.958 --> 35:16.458
before the Drazi arrive.

35:25.542 --> 35:28.250
You saved a lot
of lives today, Lyta.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.333
Thank you.

35:33.042 --> 35:35.292
You're welcome.

35:35.375 --> 35:37.583
[instrumental music]

35:57.208 --> 35:58.417
Merkat.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.042
Merkat, come.

36:01.125 --> 36:02.792
Come, see.

36:05.208 --> 36:08.208
I thought it was a new star
in the skies.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.250
Perhaps a good omen.

36:10.333 --> 36:12.250
But they are not stars.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.833
(Verchan)
'Look!'

36:13.917 --> 36:16.333
[instrumental music]

36:24.667 --> 36:26.792
Sorry to bring you out
in the middle of the night

36:26.875 --> 36:28.792
but we thought
you should see this.

36:28.875 --> 36:30.208
Ambassador, good.

36:30.292 --> 36:33.042
You should most definitely
take a look at this.

36:33.125 --> 36:35.417
Here, come on over here.

36:42.833 --> 36:45.000
This is the Enfili homeworld.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.917
They've recently
been the subject of attacks

36:47.000 --> 36:50.875
by raiders that have
decimated their homeworld.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.542
'Now they have asked
for membership'

36:53.625 --> 36:55.542
in the Alliance
and for protection.

36:55.625 --> 36:59.125
We asked the Drazi Government
to support our action

36:59.208 --> 37:01.792
since the Enfili are
on the edge of Drazi space.

37:01.875 --> 37:04.792
- Isn't that right, ambassador?
- Yes, yes.

37:04.875 --> 37:07.458
B-but what are those
shapes around Enfili?

37:07.542 --> 37:09.833
Those are White Stars,
ambassador.

37:09.917 --> 37:13.167
- How many?
- All of them.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.417
They've taken out
the few raiders that were

37:15.500 --> 37:17.417
harassing the population
and taken up

37:17.500 --> 37:19.750
defensive positions
around their planet.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.958
But they were supposed to wait
at the rendezvous point.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.708
You see, we had information
that there may be

37:26.792 --> 37:30.042
a larger fleet coming
to attack the Enfili homeworld.

37:30.125 --> 37:32.083
[dramatic music]

37:33.458 --> 37:35.000
The raiders
your ships defeated

37:35.083 --> 37:38.167
do you know if they had a chance
to send out a distress signal?

37:38.250 --> 37:39.292
'Oh, no.'

37:39.375 --> 37:41.208
They were shot
right out of the sky

37:41.292 --> 37:43.208
with great efficiency.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.417
[instrumental music]

37:49.625 --> 37:52.208
We have offered
your worlds advice

37:52.292 --> 37:55.250
and technology,
offered to help you

37:55.333 --> 37:59.125
'coordinate food supplies
and resources.'

37:59.208 --> 38:01.875
Now we put another
of our promises into effect.

38:03.583 --> 38:06.333
Your enemy is our enemy.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.458
Isn't that right, ambassador?

38:08.542 --> 38:09.917
Uh, I..

38:10.000 --> 38:11.250
(Delenn)
'That's why
we wanted you to be here'

38:11.333 --> 38:13.375
in particular, ambassador.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.583
To see our fleet in action.

38:15.667 --> 38:16.917
(Sheridan)
'Unless you can think
of a reason'

38:17.000 --> 38:18.125
'why we shouldn't.'

38:18.208 --> 38:19.125
I..

38:19.208 --> 38:21.542
[chuckles nervously]

38:21.625 --> 38:23.583
Is there something wrong,
ambassador?

38:25.958 --> 38:27.875
I, uh..

38:27.958 --> 38:30.042
I need to call my government.

38:30.125 --> 38:31.708
We're in the middle
of a council meeting.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.375
I'm sure it can wait
until later.

38:33.458 --> 38:37.083
Yes, the battle should
be starting very soon now.

38:37.167 --> 38:39.042
No, uh, I, I need
to talk to them.

38:39.125 --> 38:40.667
I need to talk
to them right now.

38:40.750 --> 38:41.875
Why?

38:41.958 --> 38:43.375
Could it be because
those are your ships

38:43.458 --> 38:45.458
coming to attack the Enfili?

38:45.542 --> 38:47.667
Your ships have been
working with the raiders

38:47.750 --> 38:50.708
to exploit and terrorize
those people for ten years?

38:50.792 --> 38:51.958
I, I can't--

38:52.042 --> 38:54.542
Answer the question,
ambassador.

38:54.625 --> 38:57.458
Yes, yes, it's true!

38:57.542 --> 38:59.417
Please, you have
to let me save them.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.167
We have hundreds of our people
onboard those ships.

39:02.250 --> 39:04.458
And the Enfili have been
dying by the thousands

39:04.542 --> 39:07.083
because of you.

39:07.167 --> 39:08.792
Y-you can't fire on our ships.

39:08.875 --> 39:10.208
We're your allies!

39:10.292 --> 39:12.500
We fought alongside you
during the Shadow War.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.750
- We're on the same side.
- Are we?

39:16.417 --> 39:19.167
Ask them.
Let them decide.

39:21.667 --> 39:23.583
Uh, please.

39:23.667 --> 39:25.583
L-let me stop our fleet.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.042
Tell them to turn around.

39:27.125 --> 39:28.458
We will leave
the Enfili unharmed.

39:28.542 --> 39:29.917
I-I-I swear to you.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.625
We will never
bother them again.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.083
Please..

39:37.375 --> 39:39.958
Alright, there's an open
Stellar-Comm link

39:40.042 --> 39:41.958
in the other room.

39:42.042 --> 39:43.833
Go on.

39:48.208 --> 39:49.833
Now, some of you have asked

39:49.917 --> 39:51.917
why you should have to sign

39:52.000 --> 39:53.625
a Declaration Of Principles

39:53.708 --> 39:55.667
before being allowed
full membership

39:55.750 --> 39:57.333
in The Alliance.

39:57.417 --> 39:59.583
Well, what you've just seen
fully illustrates the point

39:59.667 --> 40:02.042
far more eloquently
than I ever could.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.750
G'Kar?

40:09.250 --> 40:12.292
[instrumental music]

40:21.333 --> 40:23.333
Here.

40:37.583 --> 40:40.667
[instrumental music]

41:01.708 --> 41:03.792
[instrumental music]

41:13.000 --> 41:16.250
I thought you were going to file
those away someplace safe.

41:16.333 --> 41:17.958
In a little while.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.417
I was just trying to..

41:19.500 --> 41:22.125
...savor the moment a little.

41:22.208 --> 41:24.625
We don't do that nearly enough,
I think, sometimes.

41:24.708 --> 41:26.042
If you're celebrating..

41:26.125 --> 41:27.375
[sighs]

41:27.458 --> 41:30.250
...why aren't you smiling more?

41:30.333 --> 41:32.875
I was just thinking.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.792
Both our problems were
solved by telepaths.

41:35.875 --> 41:38.208
First, by getting
the important information

41:38.292 --> 41:40.583
from the ranger, and then
from the Drazi ambassador.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.875
Mr. Garibaldi was right.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.417
- Again, I-I'm not--
- Ah, Mr. President.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.500
Oh, good, good, good.
I was looking for these.

41:49.542 --> 41:50.958
What are you doing?

41:51.042 --> 41:53.583
Well, we need to get everyone
to sign them again.

41:53.667 --> 41:55.083
- What?
- Well, I--

41:55.167 --> 41:56.917
Do you understand
what we went through

41:57.000 --> 41:58.208
to get them signed
even once?

41:58.292 --> 42:00.333
I revised it again.
It's better.

42:00.417 --> 42:02.167
- G'Kar!
- But look.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.417
- It's better.
- I'll be in touch.

42:15.708 --> 42:17.750
Some days, it's like
living in a madhouse.

42:19.458 --> 42:21.083
Where was I?

42:21.167 --> 42:23.333
[sighs]
You were going to call

42:23.417 --> 42:24.792
Mr. Garibaldi and tell him

42:24.875 --> 42:26.833
that you approve of his idea

42:26.917 --> 42:28.500
of working with telepaths.

42:28.583 --> 42:31.458
[sighs]
Right.

42:31.542 --> 42:33.500
Under the circumstances,
I don't see

42:33.583 --> 42:35.750
how I can say no.

42:35.833 --> 42:37.750
We've got to watch this, Delenn.

42:37.833 --> 42:40.292
We've got to watch this
very closely.

42:40.375 --> 42:43.458
Because we are standing on
the proverbial slippery slope.

42:43.542 --> 42:45.667
And if we're not careful,
there's a big fall out there

42:45.750 --> 42:47.708
that's just waiting to happen.

43:01.542 --> 43:02.917
Excuse us.

43:07.958 --> 43:09.833
What you were
saying earlier

43:09.917 --> 43:12.167
about telepaths..

43:12.250 --> 43:14.000
I've decided.

43:14.083 --> 43:16.958
I'd like to hear a little more
about your ideas.

43:17.042 --> 43:19.167
Of course.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.958
This way.

43:22.042 --> 43:24.042
Please?

43:37.167 --> 43:39.708
[theme music]

43:56.833 --> 43:59.125
[music continues]
