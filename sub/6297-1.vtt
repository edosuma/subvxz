<i>Previously on</i>
<i>The Borgias...</i>

00:03.321 --> 00:06.758
Habemus papam!

00:06.826 --> 00:09.324
You are aware, Holy Father,
of the plots against you?

00:09.392 --> 00:12.091
Oh, what would Rome
be without a good plot?

00:12.192 --> 00:13.489
Simony!

00:13.556 --> 00:14.923
I have evidence that
will bring this house

00:14.991 --> 00:16.722
crashing down
around your ears.

00:16.823 --> 00:17.788
Evidence?

00:17.856 --> 00:19.256
Of lechery!

00:19.324 --> 00:22.663
All of Rome knows you're
the mother to my children.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.900
The pope must be
seen to be chaste.

00:24.968 --> 00:26.738
God has chosen us

00:26.806 --> 00:29.641
to sweep the Vatican
clean of corruption.

00:29.709 --> 00:32.343
What Rome needs now is-

00:32.411 --> 00:33.976
You.

00:34.043 --> 00:36.444
Don't you want them to hear
that you have a new whore?

00:36.513 --> 00:39.415
Whom can one trust,
in this Rome of ours?

00:39.483 --> 00:41.650
I believe trust needs
to be earned, my lord.

00:41.717 --> 00:43.217
Somebody!

00:43.319 --> 00:44.585
Perhaps it has been.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.922
The vultures are
circling our family.

00:47.023 --> 00:48.558
Our Rome.

00:50.728 --> 00:53.197
It seems Cardinal
Della Rovere has fled.

00:53.265 --> 00:54.498
Your Royal Highness.

00:54.599 --> 00:55.899
What do you want?

00:55.967 --> 00:58.567
I want Naples to join
in alliance with me

00:58.669 --> 00:59.936
to rid the papacy-

01:00.037 --> 01:01.204
Of the stench of Borgia.

01:01.272 --> 01:03.072
Give me control
of the papal armies

01:03.139 --> 01:04.239
and I will
protect us all.

01:04.307 --> 01:06.841
We will have one
son in the cloth-

01:06.942 --> 01:08.609
-and one in armour.

01:08.677 --> 01:09.943
You think it fits me,
Brother?

01:10.044 --> 01:11.544
And Lucrezia must marry!

01:11.612 --> 01:12.912
Bind our enemies to us!

01:12.980 --> 01:14.313
Make friends of them.

01:14.381 --> 01:16.648
And if my husband
proves ungallant?

01:18.117 --> 01:20.285
I shall cut his heart
out with a dinner knife.

01:21.654 --> 01:23.021
Lucrezia!

01:23.089 --> 01:25.224
Have you any friends
you can confide in?

01:25.325 --> 01:26.926
There is a groom.
Paolo.

01:27.027 --> 01:28.094
My lady.

01:28.161 --> 01:29.462
Young lovers are
always doomed.

01:31.032 --> 01:32.032
Lucrezia!

01:32.133 --> 01:33.200
I am with child.

01:33.268 --> 01:35.369
Thank God, not my husband's.

01:35.437 --> 01:38.171
Your Royal Highness,
King Charles of France.

01:38.239 --> 01:40.641
I want to restore the
Universal Church.

01:40.708 --> 01:42.142
To her former dignity.

01:42.210 --> 01:44.177
You will have
your war!

01:44.245 --> 01:48.047
But it will be fought
the French way.

01:48.115 --> 01:50.115
Holy Father,
we should abandon Rome.

01:50.217 --> 01:53.485
We will not tolerate
this heresy!

01:53.552 --> 01:55.219
The barbarians
are approaching!

01:55.287 --> 01:56.520
We shall outwit them.

01:56.588 --> 01:58.222
I know little of
the art of war.

01:58.289 --> 02:00.057
Thank God someone
in this family does.

02:00.125 --> 02:02.828
You are either with us-

02:02.895 --> 02:04.129
Or against us.

02:04.230 --> 02:06.298
Fire!

02:08.634 --> 02:10.669
We could be said to
have an understanding.

02:10.770 --> 02:12.238
We could indeed.

02:12.339 --> 02:15.475
The crown of Naples.

02:15.542 --> 02:18.377
King Charles will not
remain in Naples for long.

02:18.445 --> 02:19.945
Plague.

02:20.013 --> 02:21.814
Did the Borgia
Pope know of this?

02:21.881 --> 02:24.216
We should thank God
for all the blessings

02:24.283 --> 02:29.420
he has visited
upon this, our family.

Amen.

Corpus Domini nostri Iesu
Christi custodiat animam meam

05:33.642 --> 05:35.042

05:35.109 --> 05:36.376

Corpus Domini

05:57.001 --> 05:58.768
custodiat animam tuam

05:58.836 --> 06:00.336

Corpus Domini nostri

06:04.507 --> 06:06.775

06:06.876 --> 06:08.610
Amen.

06:10.946 --> 06:12.513
Is it the heat, Father?

06:12.614 --> 06:14.515
No, no, no.

06:15.784 --> 06:18.586
Corpus Domini
nostri esu Christi

06:18.653 --> 06:21.222
custodiat animam tuam
in vitam aeternam.

06:21.323 --> 06:22.957
Amen.

06:26.162 --> 06:29.532
It's-something I-ate!

06:43.348 --> 06:45.783
You may leave us,
sisters.

06:45.884 --> 06:46.984
But Cardinal-

06:47.085 --> 06:48.419
There is no need
for last rites

06:48.486 --> 06:52.423
but your prayers
would be welcome.

06:52.524 --> 06:53.690
Hush Cardinal.

06:53.791 --> 06:55.859
I will attend you.

06:59.631 --> 07:02.434
And you sisters,
let us hear your prayers.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.583
Don't worry,

07:16.651 --> 07:20.253
if you're not dead by now,
you will live.

07:20.321 --> 07:23.423
Your tongue will be
swollen for days.

07:23.490 --> 07:25.825
No talking, I'm afraid.

07:25.892 --> 07:30.262
All of your prayers
must be silent ones.

07:30.330 --> 07:34.165
Altar boys and cantarella.

07:34.233 --> 07:37.101
Neither can be trusted.

07:37.169 --> 07:40.070
But you must know
by now, Cardinal,

07:40.138 --> 07:42.406
there is no hiding place.

07:42.474 --> 07:48.278
Even here, in the depths of
the Umbrian olive groves...

07:48.379 --> 07:50.347
we will find you.

07:54.452 --> 07:56.787
The French army is
ensnared in Naples.

07:56.855 --> 07:59.990
The French king is ill,
with the Neapolitan disease.

08:00.058 --> 08:05.095
God is in His Heaven and
the pope on his seat in Rome.

08:05.163 --> 08:11.469
And my plea to you,
Cardinal, is still the same.

08:11.570 --> 08:14.272
Work with us...

08:14.373 --> 08:17.108
not against us.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.384
The cardinal will live then?

08:30.022 --> 08:32.190
So it seems, yes.

08:32.256 --> 08:34.091
But I did my duty,
did I not?

08:34.159 --> 08:35.926
I shall still
receive payment?

08:36.027 --> 08:37.561
Of course.

09:18.368 --> 09:20.102
Go with God,
sister.

09:21.504 --> 09:23.205
To Rome now.

09:23.273 --> 09:25.842
Our work here, Your Eminence,
is finished, yes?

09:25.943 --> 09:27.577
For the moment.

09:34.152 --> 09:45.128
[♪]

09:45.196 --> 09:48.131
Will we meet again,
Holy Father?

09:48.232 --> 09:50.800
Perhaps.

09:50.868 --> 09:54.336
Am I to be your
mistress then?

09:54.437 --> 09:57.306
Alas, no.

09:57.374 --> 10:00.042
That position is taken.

10:01.745 --> 10:03.546
Will I receive your
blessing at least,

10:03.614 --> 10:05.248
for this night
we spent together?

10:05.316 --> 10:08.652
You have already received
my blessing many times.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.624
And is that bliss
to be repeated?

10:12.691 --> 10:15.460
Giulia Farnese comes
back from Umbria today.

10:15.528 --> 10:20.365
She would not
countenance this.

10:20.433 --> 10:22.501
She is
strict then?

10:22.602 --> 10:25.070
Yes.
And jealous.

10:25.171 --> 10:27.338
Why?

10:27.406 --> 10:30.207
Why?
She is a woman.

10:30.275 --> 10:31.942
And, forgive me,
Holy Father-

10:32.010 --> 10:33.777
she is here.

10:42.786 --> 10:45.955
Uh, you must leave us!

10:46.023 --> 10:47.624
Don't let her in!

10:47.725 --> 10:49.158
No, no!

10:51.796 --> 10:53.897
You have to leave us!
Go!

10:53.965 --> 10:57.333
But I was promised-

10:57.434 --> 10:59.336
Oh, oh, oh, oooh.

10:59.437 --> 11:00.870
Um.

11:08.879 --> 11:10.613
Now please go!

11:15.720 --> 11:17.520
Make her vanish if
you would be so kind?

11:22.027 --> 11:23.160
His Holiness is-?

11:23.261 --> 11:24.996
His Holiness bathes.

11:27.666 --> 11:29.067
We asked for hot water!

11:29.168 --> 11:31.002
We lie in cold!

11:35.041 --> 11:37.143
This is more to
Your Holiness's liking?

11:37.210 --> 11:38.911
Ahhh...

11:38.979 --> 11:41.347
Giulia Farnese.

11:41.448 --> 11:43.082
We have missed you.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.830
Isn't this bliss?

11:59.931 --> 12:02.900
A crying child?

12:15.583 --> 12:18.619
You must avail yourself
of a wet nurse, my love.

12:18.686 --> 12:20.921
Indeed, Father.
Why?

12:20.988 --> 12:23.990
Well, you are
hardly a commoner,

12:24.058 --> 12:26.726
And your figure should
reflect that grace.

12:26.827 --> 12:28.728
Aha.

12:28.796 --> 12:31.397
Because I am yet of
marriageable age, am I not?

12:31.465 --> 12:35.401
Nothing could have been further
from our thoughts Lucrezia.

12:35.468 --> 12:39.438
This child, Holy
Father, lacks a father.

12:39.506 --> 12:43.242
Or one appropriate
to your station.

12:43.310 --> 12:46.379
And for the moment you have no
need of a marital alliance.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.115
But if the need arose, you
would marry me to the moon.

12:49.183 --> 12:50.417
What?

12:50.485 --> 12:53.020
Does the sun threaten
our papacy now?

12:53.121 --> 12:54.822
No, Father.

12:54.890 --> 12:58.026
Mars is in a unique
alignment with Saturn.

12:58.127 --> 12:59.928
The heavens beam down upon us.

12:59.995 --> 13:03.564
For the moment.

13:03.632 --> 13:04.932
But the day might come.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.834
Now let me hold him,
come along.

13:06.901 --> 13:10.170
Come.
That's right, that's right.

13:10.238 --> 13:12.939
So. A wet nurse.
We insist.

13:13.006 --> 13:15.474
Come on.
That's the way.

13:21.013 --> 13:23.982
The French ambassador
awaits Your Holiness.

13:24.049 --> 13:26.284
Oh God.
Isn't he dead yet?

13:26.352 --> 13:28.086
He's not even sick.

13:28.153 --> 13:29.587
Let's go see the
French Ambassador.

13:29.688 --> 13:31.122
See what he's got to say.

13:45.370 --> 13:46.504
Ambassador.

13:46.605 --> 13:48.239
Your Holiness.

13:58.118 --> 14:00.687
Up with you.
There we go.

14:00.788 --> 14:04.223
Ah, fine.

14:04.324 --> 14:06.358
There we go.

14:06.426 --> 14:09.127
Ah.
It's nice, isn't it?

14:13.499 --> 14:17.601
So how can we be
of assistance?

14:22.007 --> 14:24.408
The whereabouts of-
Sh, sh, sh!

14:24.476 --> 14:26.978
Pianissimo!

14:27.046 --> 14:30.115
Alfonso of Naples
is still at large.

14:30.183 --> 14:33.118
We have reason to believe that
he infected his own city

14:33.186 --> 14:35.587
with the pestilence
that plagues it.

14:35.655 --> 14:37.790
Oh, how can that concern us?

14:37.857 --> 14:42.761
We would have the ambassador
gently remind the king

14:42.829 --> 14:44.963
that Naples has the habit
of rejecting those

14:45.031 --> 14:47.332
who would conquer it.

14:47.433 --> 14:50.535
The Moor, the
Turk, the Norman.

14:50.602 --> 14:53.270
Sh, sh, sh.

14:53.338 --> 14:55.772
Why should the French
be any different?

14:55.840 --> 14:57.907
But Your Holiness invested
King Charles with the-

14:57.975 --> 15:00.644
Sh!
Pianissimo!

15:00.711 --> 15:03.614
All right, darling.
It's all right.

15:03.681 --> 15:05.949
We granted the King his wish.

15:06.017 --> 15:07.451
Naples.

15:07.552 --> 15:08.986
He has Naples.

15:09.087 --> 15:10.721
He regrets that fact.

15:10.789 --> 15:13.056
That is his tragedy
and not ours.

15:13.124 --> 15:15.126
It's not ours, is it?

15:15.193 --> 15:18.062
And now you've
woken the child.

15:18.130 --> 15:19.697
Shame on you,
ambassador.

15:19.765 --> 15:21.165
Sh.
It's all right.

15:21.233 --> 15:22.667
It's just the
nasty ambassador.

15:22.734 --> 15:24.235
Let's go and
find your mama.

15:24.303 --> 15:25.870
She'll give you something
to eat and it'll be better.

16:09.382 --> 16:14.419
So, Cardinal Della Rovere
is still alive?

16:14.487 --> 16:16.054
I would hardly
call it living.

16:16.121 --> 16:17.555
You need lessons in
killing, Brother?

16:17.656 --> 16:19.290
From you?
Enough!

16:23.963 --> 16:26.131
And King Charles of France,
what of him?

16:26.199 --> 16:29.268
He has been struck with
the Neapolitan disease.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.104
As we had hoped.

16:31.205 --> 16:32.940
So...

16:33.007 --> 16:38.545
Now is the time of reckoning
for those who betrayed us.

16:38.613 --> 16:40.647
The Vitelli, the
Orsini, the Sforza.

16:40.748 --> 16:46.087
All the great families of the
Romagna and papal states.

16:46.154 --> 16:52.059
Our task is of vengeance.

16:52.127 --> 16:56.297
We believe that the cardinals
will now, from henceforth,

16:56.398 --> 16:58.566
do our will.

16:58.634 --> 17:01.135
But now it is time to
make sure their families

17:01.203 --> 17:03.271
feel the wind
of our displeasure.

17:03.338 --> 17:06.040
Vengeance is mine,
saith the Lord.

17:06.141 --> 17:07.675
Ah.

17:07.742 --> 17:11.779
Vengeance will be ours.

17:13.883 --> 17:17.385
We shall subdue the arrogance
of those papal states,

17:17.453 --> 17:21.690
one by one by one.

17:22.858 --> 17:26.929
We will force them back
into the arms of Rome.

17:26.996 --> 17:30.666
But above all,
the Sforzas.

17:30.767 --> 17:35.871
Their betrayal of our
papacy shall be avenged.

17:35.939 --> 17:37.773
By who?
This headless cock?

17:38.942 --> 17:41.677
Will you stop this discord!

17:44.581 --> 17:46.682
We are family!

17:46.783 --> 17:49.251
We are one!

17:49.318 --> 17:52.420
And we will only
triumph as one!

17:57.859 --> 18:00.794
For we have a second task.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.765
It is called renewal.

18:03.832 --> 18:09.504
We would restore Rome
to its former glory.

18:09.606 --> 18:12.041
Under the Borgias
it will shine

18:12.142 --> 18:15.845
as it did
beneath the Caesars.

18:15.913 --> 18:19.515
But if we are to
achieve this greatness-

18:19.617 --> 18:22.986
your birthright-

18:23.087 --> 18:25.488
it will be together.

18:25.556 --> 18:27.123
As one.

18:27.191 --> 18:29.793
As family.

18:31.929 --> 18:35.131
Now let me hear you
speak that word.

18:37.401 --> 18:39.502
Give me your hand, Cesare.

18:40.971 --> 18:42.872
Family.

18:42.973 --> 18:44.908
Family.

18:45.009 --> 18:47.311
Family.

18:47.379 --> 18:49.948
Family.

19:08.669 --> 19:12.071
I have had new duelling
blades designed, Brother.

19:12.139 --> 19:17.077
Thin, and as sharp as
will be our vengeance.

19:19.413 --> 19:20.880
Show me.

19:26.121 --> 19:28.423
Hear how they sing.

19:32.628 --> 19:35.630
A blade looks incongruous
in a cleric's hand.

19:35.698 --> 19:36.831
Why?

19:36.899 --> 19:38.066
A cleric prays.

19:38.134 --> 19:39.901
He doesn't fight.

19:43.105 --> 19:44.639
Well this cleric does both.

19:44.707 --> 19:46.807
Prove it.

19:48.877 --> 19:50.645
You must attack
me then, Brother.

19:50.713 --> 19:52.447
Because I would
never attack you.

19:52.515 --> 19:54.081
Never?

19:59.087 --> 20:01.923
Our father has forbidden
discord between us.

20:02.024 --> 20:03.391
Even in jest?

20:03.492 --> 20:04.826
In jest?

20:04.894 --> 20:06.161
Attack that which can
hardly defend itself?

20:09.533 --> 20:11.934
That's an insult,
I believe.

20:33.589 --> 20:35.557
Come on, Cesare!

20:55.710 --> 20:58.078
Can you not keep your
horse still, my love?

20:58.146 --> 21:00.481
Could you ask my
horse the same?

21:03.953 --> 21:05.487
The troops are cheering,
Brother. Why?

21:05.588 --> 21:07.055
They cheer their leader.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.577
Do I detect anger in
those blows, Brother?

21:27.678 --> 21:30.379
No anger.
No envy either.

21:31.314 --> 21:33.482
I have been long steeled in
all the cardinal virtues.

21:36.585 --> 21:39.154
You must need them,
wearing a clerical collar-

21:49.066 --> 21:51.968
And I know the one sin my
father would never forgive-

21:52.036 --> 21:53.771
is fratricide.

21:53.872 --> 21:55.072
A big word, Brother-

21:58.711 --> 22:01.078
It is a big word,
Your Eminence.

22:01.179 --> 22:03.680
But pray.

22:03.748 --> 22:05.849
What does it mean, my Lord?

22:05.917 --> 22:07.784
Something to do with killing.

22:07.885 --> 22:10.053
Ah. Killing.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.788
We will have none of that.

22:11.889 --> 22:13.790
Not today.

22:13.857 --> 22:19.262
You are brothers,
after all, are you not?

22:19.363 --> 22:22.132
Your Eminence.

22:36.683 --> 22:38.184
You have found your prize.

22:38.251 --> 22:39.919
Sh sh sh...

22:43.056 --> 22:44.757
But it may have led
you to a greater one.

22:44.825 --> 22:46.392
Look.

23:27.267 --> 23:30.236
Those Romans knew
not monogamy.

23:31.706 --> 23:33.440
No.

23:33.508 --> 23:34.608
Mm.

23:34.676 --> 23:37.412
That came with Our
Lord Jesus Christ.

23:38.981 --> 23:40.948
One would hope.

23:50.193 --> 23:53.695
We must preserve these.

23:53.763 --> 23:56.331
For posterity.

23:56.399 --> 23:59.067
Not for pleasure?

23:59.135 --> 24:03.038
No.

24:03.105 --> 24:05.473
You alone are our pleasure.

24:08.310 --> 24:10.143
Indeed.

24:19.820 --> 24:21.054
Can I hold him?

24:21.122 --> 24:22.756
And wake him?

24:22.824 --> 24:24.791
That would be cruelty indeed.

24:28.731 --> 24:31.767
I must hold you then.

24:36.506 --> 24:38.507
Tell me again, my love.

24:38.575 --> 24:41.344
Who was his father?

24:41.445 --> 24:45.782
A groom.
Paolo.

24:45.849 --> 24:49.985
But I called him Narcissus,
so divine was his face.

24:50.087 --> 24:52.488
Should I envy him then?

24:52.556 --> 24:55.457
You have read your romances,
dear brother.

24:55.524 --> 24:58.626
You must know that such
love is impossible.

24:58.727 --> 25:02.829
Impossible loves.

25:02.897 --> 25:07.134
I am very much afraid they
can become an addiction.

25:08.770 --> 25:13.040
There is one your heart
must find room for, Cesare.

25:13.108 --> 25:16.410
One you must love before
you can love anyone.

25:16.478 --> 25:19.514
And that one would be?

25:21.851 --> 25:23.885
Yourself.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.310
Will I live long enough

25:47.378 --> 25:53.549
to see the one who caused
this pestilence punished?

25:53.616 --> 25:55.417
The humours of this city

25:55.485 --> 25:58.920
have been rife with
disease for centuries.

25:58.988 --> 26:04.927
Its pestilences
come and go...

26:04.995 --> 26:07.797
So I should not blame
that inbred prince?

26:07.865 --> 26:11.501
It is His Highness's privilege
to blame whom he chooses.

26:11.569 --> 26:17.908
And I choose to
blame Prince Alfonso.

26:17.976 --> 26:20.977
You knew his father,
King Ferrante?

26:21.045 --> 26:23.747
I was his physician,
Your Highness.

26:23.815 --> 26:26.316
You have heard, then,
of his torture chambers,

26:26.384 --> 26:30.687
his house of pain
below us here?

26:30.754 --> 26:35.157
I had the sad duty of working
within it, Your Highness.

26:35.225 --> 26:37.559
You were subjected
to its horrors?

26:37.627 --> 26:39.294
No, Your Highness.

26:39.395 --> 26:44.299
I had to keep alive those
unfortunates who were.

26:44.367 --> 26:47.837
And King Ferrante's
supper table.

26:47.938 --> 26:51.675
You had a hand in that?

26:51.743 --> 26:57.915
It was my duty to prepare the
corpses for the taxidermist.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.583
When they died.

26:59.651 --> 27:04.287
When my best efforts had
failed them, Your Highness.

27:04.355 --> 27:07.824
Do not fail us, Doctor.

27:07.892 --> 27:11.127
Or that house of
pain may await you.

27:12.663 --> 27:14.697
That Borgia pope!

27:14.731 --> 27:18.433
He set a trap for us in
league with Prince Alphonso.

27:18.468 --> 27:22.437
Naples, I hate it now forever.

27:22.471 --> 27:25.673
Now even the king is ill
with this pestilence!

27:28.644 --> 27:33.547
So we must have all the
frescoes removed, intact.

27:33.582 --> 27:37.484
Ah, careful!

27:37.518 --> 27:40.388
We will install them in a
chamber in the Vatican

27:40.422 --> 27:42.857
dedicated to...

27:42.891 --> 27:44.658
-pleasure?

27:44.693 --> 27:45.960
Remarkable.

27:45.994 --> 27:51.765
-dedicated to history
and the renewal-

27:51.866 --> 27:53.400
<i>Loosen these, carefully.</i>

27:53.468 --> 27:54.868
-the Eternal City.

27:57.338 --> 27:59.139
<i>Turn it over a little.</i>

28:27.137 --> 28:28.771
What is that?

28:30.540 --> 28:31.973
Apis.

28:32.041 --> 28:34.876
Sacred bull of
the goddess Isis.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.082
Could be the Borgia Bull.

28:43.285 --> 28:44.953
Some say that Isis
is the predecessor

28:45.021 --> 28:48.090
of our own Blessed
Virgin Mary.

28:48.191 --> 28:50.626
We are all to
worship Isis now?

28:50.727 --> 28:53.629
No.

28:53.697 --> 29:00.003
But we could find a way to
worship more like the ancient.

29:00.104 --> 29:02.439
With joy.

29:02.506 --> 29:07.744
I mean, instead of
constant prayer.

29:07.811 --> 29:11.480
Why not thank God for
Rome's deliverance

29:11.548 --> 29:14.549
from the French
with celebration?

29:14.650 --> 29:16.984
For the common people?

29:19.454 --> 29:22.556
You would give them
bread and circuses again?

29:22.657 --> 29:24.057
No, no.

29:24.125 --> 29:27.894
We would give them what is
lacking in their lives.

29:34.335 --> 29:36.270
Joy.

29:43.479 --> 29:45.247
Is His Holiness
lacking something?

29:46.816 --> 29:48.484
What?

29:48.552 --> 29:52.889
Does my presence no
longer fill him with joy?

29:52.957 --> 29:54.257
Oh, no, no, no.

29:54.325 --> 29:56.293
Don't say that.

31:11.735 --> 31:13.870
Do you normally
work at night?

31:13.971 --> 31:15.672
Your Holiness!

31:18.643 --> 31:20.944
Come here where
I can see you.

31:24.982 --> 31:27.784
I must practise my art in
secret, Your Holiness.

31:27.885 --> 31:30.220
I am as yet a mere artisan.

31:30.288 --> 31:34.791
Any moment I can snatch
to perfect my line, I do.

31:38.829 --> 31:40.663
You are apprenticed?

31:40.731 --> 31:43.032
To the master of Bramante,
Your Holiness.

31:43.100 --> 31:44.834
But I am as yet the
least of his pupils.

31:44.902 --> 31:46.336
Ah.

31:50.341 --> 31:51.874
Come here.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.511
I won't bite.

32:01.184 --> 32:03.151
You're very young.

32:03.252 --> 32:06.254
But youth fades.

32:06.355 --> 32:07.755
Beauty doesn't.

32:18.732 --> 32:20.566
Turn your face
to the light.

32:28.476 --> 32:31.212
What is that smile?

32:31.280 --> 32:33.215
Your Holiness.

32:37.387 --> 32:38.421
Please.

32:40.825 --> 32:44.227
You are more
Eve than Adam.

32:58.343 --> 33:01.913
Forgive me...

33:01.981 --> 33:06.718
Why would one
hide such beauty?

33:06.785 --> 33:11.189
As an apprentice,
I must be male.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.359
Or appear to be...

33:16.029 --> 33:19.699
What is your name,
fair apprentice?

33:19.766 --> 33:21.968
The master knows me
as Vittorio.

33:22.036 --> 33:25.104
And God knows you as?

33:25.205 --> 33:28.540
Vittoria.

33:28.608 --> 33:35.012
Well, Vittoria.

33:35.080 --> 33:38.348
We have to keep you a secret.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.820
We may have a
commission for you.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.962
On the 25th of June

33:52.030 --> 33:56.467
the ancient Romans
celebrated the Ludii Taurii.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.870
The Games of the Bull.

33:58.937 --> 34:01.272
Now, that is also,
by coincidence,

34:01.340 --> 34:04.842
the feast day of St. Bernard
of Vermicelli.

34:04.909 --> 34:09.245
We propose to hold a
celebration on that day

34:09.313 --> 34:11.481
for the entire
populace of Rome.

34:11.547 --> 34:15.117
The church, the nobility,
but above all,

34:15.185 --> 34:16.752
for the common people.

34:16.819 --> 34:18.620
Can a pagan feast day,
Holy Father,

34:18.688 --> 34:20.889
be reconciled with
a Christian one?

34:22.458 --> 34:24.626
If you knew anything of
your history, Cardinal,

34:24.694 --> 34:27.029
you would know that
Easter, for example,

34:27.097 --> 34:31.001
was celebrated long before
our Saviour's death.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.672
No, the ancients knew what
we seem to have forgotten.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.542
That Rome is its people.

34:37.610 --> 34:40.112
Which is why we propose
a celebration

34:40.179 --> 34:42.647
for the people of Rome.

34:42.714 --> 34:46.250
It shall include a horse race,
a public feast,

34:46.318 --> 34:50.187
a masked ball on
classical Roman themes.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.388
And-

34:52.822 --> 34:57.359
We have commissioned
a monument, in wood,

34:57.427 --> 35:02.398
to light up the celebrations.

35:02.499 --> 35:04.400
The Borgia Bull!

35:07.471 --> 35:08.972
And these celebrations,

35:09.040 --> 35:12.443
this Bull, Your Holiness,

35:12.511 --> 35:15.480
<i>does anyone have any</i>
<i>idea of the cost?</i>

35:15.547 --> 35:21.387
Can one put a price on joy,
Cardinal Sforza?

35:21.454 --> 35:23.856
No, Holy Father.
It is priceless.

35:23.923 --> 35:30.695
So, whatever the cost,
we shall have a bargain.

35:33.266 --> 35:35.934
Let Rome be full of joy!

35:45.844 --> 35:47.979
Interesting.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.614
Thank you, Madam.

35:51.417 --> 35:55.653
But your animal lacks
physical concreteness.

36:00.459 --> 36:03.862
That creature is more
cow than bull, surely.

36:03.930 --> 36:06.499
Pardon me?

36:06.600 --> 36:10.036
You have, how should I put it?

36:11.772 --> 36:14.508
Desexed the creature.

36:14.576 --> 36:17.244
It is a bull, surely, Madam.

36:17.312 --> 36:24.151
It looks like a bull,
it stands like a bull.

36:24.218 --> 36:27.721
But it lacks something
of the male vigour.

36:30.391 --> 36:32.958
Like you, perhaps.

36:37.129 --> 36:38.963
Your name, Maestro?

36:39.064 --> 36:40.798
Vittorio.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.701
I am as yet no maestro.

36:42.802 --> 36:44.702
No?

36:44.770 --> 36:47.605
Then a mistress, perhaps?

36:47.673 --> 36:50.175
My lady.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.277
Giulia Farnese.

36:54.947 --> 37:01.152
And you, Vittorio, have so
cleverly disguised your hair.

37:06.392 --> 37:11.629
Why the deceit, fair lady?

37:11.730 --> 37:14.732
A woman cannot be apprenticed.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.702
I know.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.605
To any trade other
than wet nurse.

37:30.950 --> 37:34.286
And you would
sit on Parnassus,

37:34.387 --> 37:36.355
with your master,
Bramante.

37:40.994 --> 37:43.996
I beg you, my lady.

37:44.097 --> 37:48.000
Yes.

37:48.102 --> 37:49.735
You may yet beg.

37:52.272 --> 37:53.839
And I am your lady.

38:00.045 --> 38:04.116
At least the pope is not
tempted with the sin of sodomy.

38:12.327 --> 38:14.128
His Holiness-

38:14.229 --> 38:15.663
-claimed to know nothing.

38:15.730 --> 38:18.966
Is he a fox, or a
holy fool, that pope?

38:19.034 --> 38:21.135
He is definitely
no fool, my liege.

38:21.203 --> 38:24.037
But if he thinks he's
fooled me, Ambassador,

38:24.105 --> 38:26.340
he'll find he's wrong.

38:26.408 --> 38:29.176
This room was King
Ferrante's joke,

38:29.243 --> 38:31.811
a parody of the last supper.

38:31.879 --> 38:34.314
Do you find it amusing?

38:34.415 --> 38:36.549
I find it repellent, my liege.

38:36.617 --> 38:39.485
But the Judas seat is empty.

38:39.553 --> 38:41.954
It awaits its occupant.

38:42.022 --> 38:45.859
That Judas who betrayed
his own people,

38:45.927 --> 38:50.031
infected his own city.

38:50.099 --> 38:54.135
Prince Alfonso of Naples.

38:54.203 --> 38:56.304
There has been a
sighting, my liege,

38:56.405 --> 38:58.306
on the slopes of Vesuvius.

38:58.374 --> 39:02.444
Hunt him down, wherever he is.

39:02.512 --> 39:05.313
Bring him here.

39:05.381 --> 39:08.684
Unharmed.

39:08.751 --> 39:11.220
I would see him in this chair.

39:13.923 --> 39:16.558
<i>Come on, higher!</i>

39:22.098 --> 39:23.932
All right, ready, move!

39:24.000 --> 39:25.133
No, where it is!

39:25.234 --> 39:26.568
Bring it down!

39:26.669 --> 39:28.136
To that side!

39:28.204 --> 39:31.040
Come on.

39:31.107 --> 39:32.675
Higher!

39:32.776 --> 39:34.243
Come on!

39:36.280 --> 39:37.614
Give me some more rope.

39:37.715 --> 39:40.951
His Holiness has ordered
that Rome be full of joy.

39:41.018 --> 39:43.520
And how much
does joy cost?

39:43.587 --> 39:45.522
Two hundred and fifty
thousand ducats so far.

39:45.589 --> 39:47.523
<i>Wrap it in muslin now!</i>
<i>Tightly!</i>

39:47.625 --> 39:49.792
And counting.

39:53.096 --> 39:54.597
Ha! Come on!

39:54.698 --> 39:55.931
Come on, Brother!

39:55.999 --> 39:58.800
Ha! Ya! Ya!

40:02.705 --> 40:06.240
Come on!
Ya! Ya!

40:07.877 --> 40:10.077
Given up already, Cesare?

40:12.781 --> 40:16.350
A wager,
for the race tomorrow.

40:16.451 --> 40:18.720
My brother or me.

40:22.024 --> 40:25.894
You...

40:25.962 --> 40:28.798
...if he doesn't cheat.

40:40.612 --> 40:41.978
Do you hear that
roar, Brother?

40:42.079 --> 40:43.513
I think it's for me.

40:43.581 --> 40:45.181
Who else?

40:45.282 --> 40:47.317
<i>Ready!</i>

41:08.438 --> 41:10.106
You think you can
beat me, Brother?

41:10.207 --> 41:11.441
Always!

41:13.544 --> 41:16.013
Ya! Ya!

41:26.558 --> 41:27.825
Give them the scent.

41:27.893 --> 41:29.193
Take the scent!

41:29.261 --> 41:30.795
Come on!

41:30.862 --> 41:32.430
Give them the scent of
who was once their ruler-

41:32.497 --> 41:33.631
what was his name?

41:33.732 --> 41:34.832
Prince Alfonso!

41:34.933 --> 41:35.932
Allez avec moi.

41:36.034 --> 41:37.101
Maintenant!

41:37.168 --> 41:38.802
And they know him well.

42:21.946 --> 42:24.214
Borgia!

42:25.984 --> 42:28.386
Caltrops.

42:33.559 --> 42:35.393
<i>After him!</i>

42:41.868 --> 42:43.568
<i>Get him!</i>
<i>Up there!</i>

42:50.208 --> 42:51.943
<i>Coward!</i>
<i>We'll get you!</i>

42:56.715 --> 42:58.682
<i>Go get him!</i>

42:58.783 --> 43:00.684
<i>Come down, you coward!</i>

43:00.752 --> 43:03.053
I claim the right
of feudal privilege!

43:03.154 --> 43:05.356
I shall bow to no
common soldier!

43:05.423 --> 43:07.224
<i>You will bow to a king then!</i>

43:20.272 --> 43:21.772
Let me guess, my love.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.240
An owl?

43:23.341 --> 43:25.476
Yes, Your Holiness.

43:25.544 --> 43:27.945
And an owl signifies?

43:28.013 --> 43:29.613
Oh, I am the owl of Minerva.

43:29.714 --> 43:30.648
Oh.

43:30.715 --> 43:34.384
Goddess of magic and wisdom.

43:34.452 --> 43:47.398
[♪]

43:47.465 --> 43:48.933
Who is my dear
sister tonight?

43:51.002 --> 43:52.503
I am Echo.

43:52.604 --> 43:54.405
I may not be Narcissus.

43:54.473 --> 43:56.141
But may I dance with Echo?

43:58.111 --> 44:01.247
My Narcissus could not dance.

44:01.315 --> 44:02.682
He could not read nor write.

44:04.317 --> 44:06.485
Could he make you smile?

44:08.655 --> 44:10.256
Can you?

44:10.357 --> 44:12.524
I can try.

44:17.330 --> 44:20.165
Ah!

44:23.402 --> 44:25.070
Hush now.

44:26.372 --> 44:28.807
Unhand me!

44:28.908 --> 44:30.509
Hurts!

44:41.120 --> 44:42.353
I must protest,
Your Highness,

44:42.421 --> 44:45.624
at my treatment
by your captors.

44:45.692 --> 44:49.595
The laws of chivalry
demand I not be bound.

44:50.596 --> 44:54.900
Even a prince cannot
eat in handcuffs.

44:55.001 --> 44:56.869
<i>Soldat.</i>

45:08.280 --> 45:11.649
I, sadly,
cannot partake.

45:14.553 --> 45:16.154
His Highness feels poorly?

45:16.221 --> 45:17.455
Yes.

45:17.523 --> 45:19.657
A strange pestilence
has laid me low.

45:19.725 --> 45:22.527
Has laid the whole
of Naples low indeed.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.830
Ah.

45:26.265 --> 45:29.468
What a pity.

45:29.569 --> 45:31.637
His Highness will recover?

45:33.039 --> 45:35.841
We have been so assured.

45:35.943 --> 45:38.211
Oh goody!

45:40.414 --> 45:41.781
I cannot wait to
show His Highness

45:41.849 --> 45:43.483
the delights
of our fair city.

45:43.584 --> 45:45.018
What remains of it.

45:54.129 --> 45:55.630
Father.

46:08.577 --> 46:11.011
You are Apollo, my son?

46:11.079 --> 46:12.947
No, Father, I am Mars.

46:13.048 --> 46:14.181
Oh.

46:14.249 --> 46:16.284
But no warfare
tonight we trust.

46:16.385 --> 46:17.385
No.

46:17.486 --> 46:19.554
Tonight is for celebrations.

46:19.621 --> 46:21.922
Who are you tonight, Father?

46:21.990 --> 46:23.958
We are Janus.

46:24.026 --> 46:26.660
The guardian of
the keys of Rome.

46:26.728 --> 46:28.929
Of the gateway to paradise.

46:29.031 --> 46:30.965
So there's no
pope here tonight?

46:31.033 --> 46:33.201
The pope has have
two faces, my son.

46:33.268 --> 46:36.638
One looks to the future
and the other to the past.

46:36.706 --> 46:39.140
We are the
gatekeeper to both.

46:56.027 --> 46:58.496
Pah.

46:58.597 --> 47:01.031
People are born
and people die.

47:01.099 --> 47:03.066
They breed like rabbits
here, Your Highness.

47:03.134 --> 47:06.302
Naples will recover and
her splendour always does.

47:06.370 --> 47:09.205
Perhaps the Prince will give
me a tour of its delights.

47:09.273 --> 47:12.442
It would be my utmost
honour, Your Royal Highness.

47:12.510 --> 47:14.477
And perhaps he would
begin with a tour

47:14.545 --> 47:17.047
of his father's dungeons.

47:19.817 --> 47:23.620
My father's dungeons?

47:23.687 --> 47:25.522
We have seen
his banquet room,

47:25.589 --> 47:27.591
where King Ferrante
liked to dine

47:27.659 --> 47:31.429
with those
who displeased him.

47:31.497 --> 47:36.368
But the ingenuity
of his torture chambers...

47:36.436 --> 47:40.305
for that we felt
a tour was necessary.

47:40.373 --> 47:41.807
A tour?

48:06.233 --> 48:07.700
Juno?

48:07.768 --> 48:10.970
Well spotted,
Giulia Farnese.

48:11.037 --> 48:13.906
And you are?

48:13.973 --> 48:16.007
You may call me Minerva.

48:16.075 --> 48:18.543
Ah.
And to think.

48:18.611 --> 48:20.879
You were Venus once.

48:20.947 --> 48:24.049
And I soon may be
a vestal virgin.

48:26.886 --> 48:30.489
You fear for the constancy
of your lover's affections?

48:30.556 --> 48:35.727
And, if I may be so bold,
I would ask for your advice.

48:35.795 --> 48:37.730
When his eye wanders?

48:37.798 --> 48:39.465
As it did from me to you?

48:39.533 --> 48:41.000
You must hate me.

48:41.068 --> 48:42.502
No.

48:42.570 --> 48:46.339
And if you would take my
advice, don't do as I did.

48:46.406 --> 48:47.606
Rage, remonstrate.

48:47.674 --> 48:49.175
Play the wounded wife.

48:49.276 --> 48:50.976
No?

48:51.044 --> 48:54.780
So what is the
Goddess Juno's advice?

48:54.848 --> 48:58.084
He is Janus tonight,
is he not?

48:58.185 --> 49:00.820
He looks both ways.

49:00.921 --> 49:02.988
Allow him his fancy.

49:03.056 --> 49:05.458
Let him look both ways.

49:05.526 --> 49:09.094
But be sure one of those
gazes falls on you.

49:23.811 --> 49:29.182
And this ingenious
construct, my Prince.

49:29.283 --> 49:30.917
Has it a name?

49:31.018 --> 49:32.285
It is called...

49:32.353 --> 49:37.022
a Judas Cradle.

49:37.090 --> 49:39.125
What an elegant name.

49:55.409 --> 49:59.111
Do not let me think you have
dressed as Hermaphodite?

49:59.212 --> 50:00.646
No, my Lady.

50:00.714 --> 50:05.084
I am Vulcan, god of molten
metal, of the artisans.

50:05.152 --> 50:06.385
Ah.

50:06.486 --> 50:08.955
A humble station.

50:09.056 --> 50:11.091
You would do well
to maintain it.

50:17.332 --> 50:19.266
And His Holiness is?

50:19.334 --> 50:24.505
You would find out
who His Holiness is?

50:30.846 --> 50:32.947
Follow me then.

50:38.120 --> 50:40.388
And this?

50:46.095 --> 50:53.602
It-is called the
Pear of Anguish.

50:53.703 --> 50:55.971
And its use?

50:56.072 --> 51:00.042
It can be inserted,

51:00.110 --> 51:06.116
into the mouth, or into the...

51:06.183 --> 51:10.387
rect...
rect...

51:10.454 --> 51:12.889
Aha, he means the
rectum, does he not?

51:12.957 --> 51:13.957
The rear.

51:14.058 --> 51:15.291
The back passage.

51:15.359 --> 51:17.060
I believe he does,
Your Highness.

51:17.127 --> 51:30.605
[♪]

51:30.607 --> 51:39.046
[♪]

51:39.048 --> 51:46.520
[♪]

51:46.588 --> 51:49.890
You are now Aphrodite.

51:49.958 --> 51:52.125
Lover of Hermes.

52:00.169 --> 52:02.870
Mother of Hermaphrodite.

52:21.389 --> 52:23.890
It almost harmonizes.

52:23.958 --> 52:25.993
Sing, sing.
