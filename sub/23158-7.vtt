WEBVTT

00:03.709 --> 00:05.336
You're gonna
owe me for this.

00:05.411 --> 00:06.435
Sorry.

00:08.147 --> 00:09.512
Somebody stole her life

00:09.582 --> 00:11.812
and nobody has the right
to take that away from her.

00:12.885 --> 00:13.874
I didn't kill her.

00:13.953 --> 00:14.885
Convince me.

00:14.954 --> 00:17.286
You want us to set up
a drug buy. Thomas.

00:17.356 --> 00:18.983
It's the only way
I'm gonna find him.

00:19.058 --> 00:19.990
Freeze!

00:20.059 --> 00:21.048
Hi, guys.

00:22.095 --> 00:23.756
Who are you talking to?
Hey, Hey!

00:23.830 --> 00:24.922
Get him
out of here.

02:12.572 --> 02:13.561
Hi.

02:13.639 --> 02:15.004
Can I borrow
your towel?

02:15.374 --> 02:16.341
Yeah, sure.

02:16.409 --> 02:17.569
Thank you.

02:43.603 --> 02:44.797
Hi, Magnum.

02:44.870 --> 02:46.132
Hi, Kacy.

02:46.806 --> 02:48.501
See you
at the surf meet.

02:48.574 --> 02:49.734
You got it.

02:51.077 --> 02:52.874
Hmm. Thank you.

03:50.770 --> 03:51.668
May I?

03:51.737 --> 03:52.795
Sure.

03:55.808 --> 03:56.797
Kacy.

04:00.413 --> 04:02.278
So, how have you been?

04:03.382 --> 04:04.974
I'm fine, how are you?

04:05.785 --> 04:06.717
Same.

04:08.287 --> 04:09.686
Can I get you
another drink?

04:09.755 --> 04:10.653
Sure.

04:10.723 --> 04:11.712
White wine?

04:11.791 --> 04:12.780
Okay.

04:31.110 --> 04:32.941
Look how those waves
are setting up.

04:34.747 --> 04:36.510
Yeah, they're settin' up real nice.

04:38.951 --> 04:40.748
I'd rather
look at you.

05:08.881 --> 05:12.248
<i>Hawaii is one of those places</i>
<i>that keeps topping itself.</i>

05:12.318 --> 05:15.446
<i>Just when you think you'll never</i>
<i>see another sunset as beautiful,</i>

05:15.521 --> 05:18.957
<i>there comes a sunrise that even</i>
<i>Gauguin could only imagine.</i>

05:19.392 --> 05:22.327
<i>It kind of makes unemployment</i>
<i>easier to take.</i>

05:23.162 --> 05:24.561
Magnum.

05:26.465 --> 05:27.454
Oh, Magnum.

05:29.969 --> 05:31.300
Hi, Higgins.

05:31.937 --> 05:33.029
Guys.

05:33.105 --> 05:34.094
I, uh,

05:34.740 --> 05:36.139
I have a proposition
for you, Magnum.

05:36.208 --> 05:37.334
I'm sure that...

05:37.410 --> 05:38.604
Now wait a minute,

05:38.677 --> 05:40.736
just wait a second, Higgins.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.511
I mean this is really getting
depressing, this constant deal-making.

05:44.583 --> 05:48.075
"I'll give you this if you give
me that." It's so unnecessary.

05:48.854 --> 05:51.152
I mean, here we are,
living in paradise.

05:51.223 --> 05:53.054
I'm talkin' paradise,
Higgins.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.786
We have everything
we could ever

05:54.860 --> 05:57.385
possibly want out
of life right here.

05:57.463 --> 05:58.657
So, why?

05:59.231 --> 06:02.564
Why can't we just
do things for one another

06:02.635 --> 06:04.500
simply because we want to?

06:04.570 --> 06:06.731
Simply because we're friends?

06:06.806 --> 06:08.330
Simply because

06:08.407 --> 06:10.534
we feel like
helping one another?

06:14.246 --> 06:15.474
Magnum, I

06:16.015 --> 06:18.279
want you to know,
I'm quite touched.

06:19.518 --> 06:21.452
I never thought you
were capable of those

06:21.520 --> 06:22.646
admirable sentiments.

06:22.721 --> 06:23.779
I really mean that.

06:24.490 --> 06:25.582
Thank you.

06:26.892 --> 06:29.952
I came down here
this morning to,

06:30.329 --> 06:32.524
just as you
so aptly describe it,

06:32.598 --> 06:33.929
make a deal.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.491
You see, the Audi's
a bit under the weather,

06:36.569 --> 06:38.594
and I need to pick up
some paperwork from the club.

06:39.038 --> 06:41.529
I was going to ask you
to fetch it for me.

06:41.907 --> 06:44.603
In return, I was going to give
you use of the tennis courts

06:44.677 --> 06:46.076
for one week.

06:46.378 --> 06:49.541
But now,
I'm just asking you

06:50.316 --> 06:51.510
as a friend.

06:53.018 --> 06:54.178
Two weeks.

07:00.559 --> 07:02.322
<i>So far, not a bad morning.</i>

07:02.394 --> 07:04.157
<i>I figured</i>
<i>after breakfast at Rick's</i>

07:04.230 --> 07:05.788
<i>and picking up</i>
<i>Higgins' papers,</i>

07:05.865 --> 07:08.163
<i>I'd go get</i>
<i>my tennis racquet re-strung.</i>

07:08.601 --> 07:09.499
Hi, Rick.

07:09.568 --> 07:10.535
Hi, Thomas.

07:10.603 --> 07:12.662
I thought you were going
to have my breakfast ready.

07:12.738 --> 07:14.171
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:15.741 --> 07:17.140
What's the matter?

07:18.210 --> 07:21.077
Did you see all those
cops on the way down here?

07:23.716 --> 07:24.842
Who is it?

07:26.485 --> 07:27.611
Kacy.

07:58.951 --> 08:01.886
<i>The death of a friend is</i>
<i>never an easy thing to take.</i>

08:01.954 --> 08:04.752
<i>Not in a rice paddy or</i>
<i>on a pretty beach in Oahu.</i>

08:05.591 --> 08:07.286
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>when they are young,</i>

08:07.726 --> 08:09.125
<i>it never makes sense.</i>

08:13.065 --> 08:15.829
<i>Kacy was quite a surfer</i>
<i>in the early '70s,</i>

08:15.901 --> 08:16.925
<i>a champ.</i>

08:17.002 --> 08:19.698
<i>The biggest thing in her life,</i>
<i>outside of never wanting to grow up</i>

08:19.772 --> 08:22.935
<i>and having a good time,</i>
<i>was gonna be her comeback.</i>

08:35.688 --> 08:36.655
Excuse me.

08:36.722 --> 08:37.711
Yeah?

08:37.823 --> 08:40.690
My name is Thomas Magnum.
I'm a private investigator.

08:40.759 --> 08:42.249
Private investigator?

08:42.995 --> 08:44.929
Terrific. Who hired you?

08:45.364 --> 08:47.457
Nobody,
I was a friend of hers.

08:47.533 --> 08:49.831
Seems like
she had a lot of friends.

08:52.705 --> 08:53.967
Can I help you, sir?

08:54.039 --> 08:55.802
Yeah, just tell me
what happened.

08:55.874 --> 08:58.866
Oh, what happened is that your
friend met some guy at the Surfrider,

08:58.944 --> 09:01.606
picked him up, took a stroll
on the beach, and got wasted.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.704
Lousy way to go,

09:02.781 --> 09:05.181
but it goes with the lifestyle,
you know what I'm sayin'?

09:05.718 --> 09:06.878
Who found her?

09:06.952 --> 09:08.613
A couple of joggers.

09:10.189 --> 09:11.486
How was she killed?

09:11.724 --> 09:13.589
You're gonna have to
ask the coroner that.

09:13.659 --> 09:15.183
Now if you're though
questioning us,

09:15.260 --> 09:16.852
we'd like to get
ourselves some chow.

09:16.929 --> 09:19.659
You see, we've been on
a 12-hour graveyard shift.

09:19.732 --> 09:22.200
And this isn't the most appetizing
way to start a breakfast.

09:22.668 --> 09:23.965
Ask the coroner.

09:25.871 --> 09:26.803
Let's go.

09:27.373 --> 09:30.672
Break it up here. Come on, everybody,
it's all over. Break it up.

09:33.045 --> 09:33.977
Hey.

09:35.514 --> 09:37.141
It has been a long shift.

09:38.617 --> 09:39.675
Yeah.

09:49.762 --> 09:51.662
<i>One of the clichés</i>
<i>of my profession</i>

09:51.730 --> 09:53.698
<i>is that to get information</i>
<i>from a bartender,</i>

09:53.766 --> 09:56.826
<i>you have to slip him some</i>
<i>bills of various denominations.</i>

09:56.902 --> 10:00.531
<i>Bills that you can't afford,</i>
<i>with pictures of unfamiliar Presidents.</i>

10:00.973 --> 10:04.033
<i>And usually for information</i>
<i>that isn't worth it.</i>

10:04.109 --> 10:05.599
<i>However,</i>
<i>this was a special case.</i>

10:05.678 --> 10:07.703
<i>I wasn't in the mood</i>
<i>for games.</i>

10:10.349 --> 10:11.373
Who did she
leave with?

10:11.450 --> 10:13.247
I already told the cops
everything I know.

10:13.318 --> 10:14.342
Give me a break.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.478
Tell me!

10:15.554 --> 10:17.351
Kacy left with a
different guy every night.

10:17.423 --> 10:18.447
What's the difference?

10:18.524 --> 10:20.287
The difference is
she's dead.

10:22.928 --> 10:24.589
Well, you know
how it is.

10:24.697 --> 10:26.528
Kacy liked to have
a good time.

10:26.598 --> 10:28.725
Liked to get high,
fool around.

10:29.435 --> 10:30.868
Get to the point, friend.

10:30.936 --> 10:32.335
Yeah, okay.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.537
She had a couple of
drinks with this guy,

10:36.608 --> 10:38.439
name's Gary something.

10:38.510 --> 10:41.343
Got a beard,
deals a little grass,

10:41.413 --> 10:43.438
a little snow,
nothing too heavy.

10:43.515 --> 10:44.948
Where does he live?

10:46.318 --> 10:47.910
Got an old shack
at the beach,

10:47.986 --> 10:50.454
at Haleiwa,
hasn't got an address.

10:51.990 --> 10:53.287
You'll never find him.

10:53.358 --> 10:55.383
Told the cops
the same thing.

10:55.461 --> 10:56.758
Something like this happens,

10:56.829 --> 10:59.229
even if he's not involved,
he's gone.

10:59.298 --> 11:00.526
You know...

11:03.836 --> 11:04.928
Thank you.

11:18.650 --> 11:21.517
<i>Another cliché about getting</i>
<i>information from bartenders</i>

11:21.587 --> 11:24.021
<i>is that no matter</i>
<i>how sincere they sound,</i>

11:24.089 --> 11:25.886
<i>you know as soon</i>
<i>as you're out the door,</i>

11:25.958 --> 11:28.586
<i>they're on the phone warning</i>
<i>the guy you're trying to see</i>

11:28.660 --> 11:32.426
<i>and this guy didn't particularly</i>
<i>strike me as being any different.</i>

11:37.236 --> 11:38.464
Hi, guy.

11:48.013 --> 11:51.176
<i>Actually, Ralph turned out to</i>
<i>be surprisingly cooperative.</i>

11:51.250 --> 11:53.115
<i>Gave me real</i>
<i>explicit directions</i>

11:53.185 --> 11:54.812
<i>to Gary's last</i>
<i>known whereabouts,</i>

11:54.887 --> 11:58.288
<i>which I'm sure is a whole lot</i>
<i>more than he did for the cops.</i>

11:58.357 --> 12:01.451
<i>That's one of the advantages</i>
<i>of being independent.</i>

12:02.127 --> 12:06.063
<i>Of course, you never can tell when</i>
<i>somebody might be lying to you,</i>

12:06.131 --> 12:08.156
<i>even a friendly guy</i>
<i>like Ralph.</i>

12:53.278 --> 12:54.677
Freeze!

13:00.619 --> 13:02.416
Okay. Assume the position.

13:03.222 --> 13:04.484
Hi, guys.

13:05.524 --> 13:06.855
He's clean.

13:06.925 --> 13:08.654
What are you
doin' here, Magnum?

13:08.727 --> 13:09.887
Well, I just came...

13:09.962 --> 13:11.793
That's him. Hold it.

13:12.364 --> 13:13.422
Down.

13:52.104 --> 13:53.298
Hold it.

13:54.006 --> 13:55.030
Police.

13:55.107 --> 13:56.096
I said hold it.

13:56.174 --> 13:57.698
All right, no problem.

14:00.779 --> 14:02.269
What's the matter?

14:03.115 --> 14:05.811
Somebody mind tellin' me
what's going on here?

14:08.053 --> 14:09.611
You have the right
to remain silent.

14:09.688 --> 14:11.053
Anything you say
can and will be

14:11.123 --> 14:12.750
used in evidence
against you in court.

14:15.961 --> 14:18.452
Are you still going to enter
that surf-ski meet next week?

14:18.764 --> 14:20.959
Oh. Haven't given it
much thought.

14:21.033 --> 14:22.500
Think you should.

14:22.801 --> 14:23.961
I don't know.

14:24.269 --> 14:26.635
Do it, man.
It will do you some good.

14:27.272 --> 14:28.296
Do me
some good, too.

14:28.373 --> 14:29.863
I needs me
some good laughs.

14:32.678 --> 14:33.736
What, are you sick?

14:33.812 --> 14:35.837
See what he's trying to do?
Pay his own check?

14:35.914 --> 14:37.211
Hey, I'm glad
he's in the mood.

14:37.282 --> 14:38.681
I got a list
of bills here.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.274
Sorry,
put it on my tab.

14:40.352 --> 14:42.547
Uh, hold it a minute.

14:43.055 --> 14:45.990
I just heard from a buddy of mine
that they released Gary last night.

14:46.758 --> 14:47.986
Insufficient evidence.

14:48.060 --> 14:50.824
They didn't have enough to justify
an indictment on the murder rap.

14:51.296 --> 14:52.923
Gary got out on bail

14:52.998 --> 14:54.488
and the drug charges.

14:55.367 --> 14:57.699
Word on the street is,
Thomas, that he's the guy.

14:57.769 --> 14:59.794
You mean
they just let him go?

15:00.772 --> 15:02.000
Yeah.

15:10.331 --> 15:11.457
You got it, Magnum.

15:11.532 --> 15:12.624
Why?

15:12.700 --> 15:14.224
Well, I'm sorry,
but I didn't realize

15:14.302 --> 15:16.327
we needed your permission
to release the suspect.

15:16.404 --> 15:18.133
Come on.
Don't get cute with me, Sergeant.

15:18.205 --> 15:21.800
If you didn't have anything
on the guy, why did you
arrest him in the first place?

15:21.876 --> 15:23.673
For the newspapers?
"Case solved."

15:23.744 --> 15:25.609
Then 2 days later
you let him out the door.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.272
We have a narcotics rap
on him.

15:27.348 --> 15:28.474
Oh, that's great.

15:28.549 --> 15:30.983
That's just great,
if he ever shows.

15:31.052 --> 15:32.849
Tell me one thing,
will you?

15:33.187 --> 15:34.484
Do you think
he did it?

15:34.555 --> 15:35.613
No.

15:35.690 --> 15:37.521
Then where do you
go from here?

15:38.025 --> 15:39.458
We'll be following it up.

15:39.527 --> 15:40.721
Oh, yeah?

15:40.928 --> 15:43.453
Will you forgive me, Sergeant,
if this sounds a little cynical,

15:43.531 --> 15:45.055
but you're not going
to get anything

15:45.132 --> 15:47.259
sitting on your butt
waiting for it to come to you.

15:47.335 --> 15:50.498
Now, somehow I'd think that you'd
have the whole 7th Cavalry out here

15:50.571 --> 15:53.165
if Kacy was also a sophomore
at University of Hawaii.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.401
Good family in Kahala.
Nice girl.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.205
You trying to tell me
that I don't care?

15:57.278 --> 15:59.644
No, I'm just trying
to find out how much.

16:00.648 --> 16:02.309
You better remember
one thing, Magnum.

16:02.383 --> 16:04.908
I could've booked you yesterday
on an obstruction charge.

16:04.986 --> 16:07.284
It can still be arranged,
you got that?

16:11.058 --> 16:12.286
Magnum.

16:17.965 --> 16:20.195
Come on, you gotta understand
where he's comin' from.

16:20.267 --> 16:21.427
He's a good guy.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.367
He just doesn't like
private eyes

16:23.437 --> 16:24.802
doing what he thinks
is his job.

16:24.872 --> 16:27.363
All I want is
for him to do his job.

16:28.275 --> 16:29.435
We're trying.

16:29.510 --> 16:30.875
Well, I'm sorry.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.412
Look,

16:33.547 --> 16:36.414
the next time you wanna know something,
why don't you call me?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.712
It might make it easier
for everyone.

16:39.587 --> 16:41.054
You will fill me in?

16:41.889 --> 16:44.084
As long as
it's a two-way street.

16:44.625 --> 16:45.887
You got a deal.

16:45.960 --> 16:46.949
Okay.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.330
You want us to set up
a drug buy. Thomas.

16:54.402 --> 16:56.165
But it's the only way
I'm gonna find him.

16:56.237 --> 16:57.761
You mess around
with a guy like that,

16:57.838 --> 17:00.432
you're gonna walk out with a
2-inch neck. Yeah. If you walk out.

17:00.508 --> 17:01.736
Guys, it's not for me,
honest.

17:01.809 --> 17:04.277
Did you have something going with Kacy?
Yes,

17:05.179 --> 17:06.476
she was a friend.

17:10.951 --> 17:13.646
Okay, I'm in.
At least until the shooting starts.

17:13.721 --> 17:16.315
Friendship doesn't go that far,
not once-removed, anyway.

17:16.390 --> 17:17.378
Yeah, ditto.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.483
Thanks guys, I'll make it up to you,
I promise. Now...

17:19.560 --> 17:20.992
Whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa,
T.M.

17:21.061 --> 17:24.589
Don't make any promises, in the heat
of the moment, that you can't keep.

17:24.799 --> 17:25.959
T.C.

17:26.032 --> 17:27.465
Rick, phone.

17:27.535 --> 17:29.002
Hey, if that's my
answering service

17:29.070 --> 17:31.732
with a lesser paying job,
you can count me out.

17:33.007 --> 17:34.634
Yes. Uh-huh.

17:38.145 --> 17:39.134
Uh-huh.

17:40.648 --> 17:41.672
Uh-huh.

17:43.017 --> 17:44.609
Yeah, okay.

17:47.054 --> 17:48.078
That was Higgins.

17:48.155 --> 17:50.020
He says don't forget
to bring the paperwork

17:50.091 --> 17:51.752
that you promised.
He's still waiting.

17:51.826 --> 17:53.020
Paperwork?
Mmm-hmm.

17:53.094 --> 17:55.756
About 2 dozen cardboard boxes
that are sitting in my storeroom.

17:55.830 --> 17:58.060
It's the guest lists
for the past 32 years.

17:58.132 --> 18:01.329
Higgins wants to take them and run them
through Robin Masters' new computer

18:01.402 --> 18:04.064
to separate the stiffs from
the members in good standing.

18:04.138 --> 18:05.503
Look, I don't have time
for that.

18:05.573 --> 18:07.302
Besides, 4 boxes
won't fit in my Ferrari.

18:07.374 --> 18:08.568
They'll fit in my van.

18:08.642 --> 18:09.540
What?

18:10.010 --> 18:12.672
You know, no real drug dealer
would be caught dead in a van.

18:12.746 --> 18:15.738
He would want something
with class, something bad.

18:15.816 --> 18:17.306
Something like a...

18:17.718 --> 18:18.742
Ferrari.

18:19.787 --> 18:20.719
Right.

19:05.499 --> 19:06.796
Oh, uh,

19:06.867 --> 19:08.300
scotch, rocks.

19:08.369 --> 19:10.098
Uh, give me the same,
make it a double.

19:10.171 --> 19:11.331
Comin' up.

19:12.773 --> 19:14.900
Remember, let me
do the talkin'.

19:14.975 --> 19:16.636
You are the muscle.
I'm the brains.

19:18.179 --> 19:20.079
Don't stretch things
too far.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.610
$4.25, slick.

19:29.123 --> 19:30.215
Keep it.

19:30.524 --> 19:32.958
Hey, Jake,
I got a little problem.

19:33.027 --> 19:34.517
I think maybe
you can help me out.

19:34.595 --> 19:35.755
I doubt it.

19:35.930 --> 19:37.488
Well,
I hear you can.

19:38.132 --> 19:40.191
You see,
I'm looking to score.

19:40.267 --> 19:41.859
Someone told me
to ask for Gary.

19:43.938 --> 19:45.166
Don't know any Gary.

19:45.239 --> 19:47.833
Come on, Juan.
I'm talking about Gary.

19:49.176 --> 19:50.370
That Gary.

19:52.012 --> 19:54.640
Why don't you drink up and get
your face out of my bar, huh?

19:54.715 --> 19:57.809
Okay, okay,
but you just lost 5 points, Bruce.

19:58.485 --> 20:01.420
You see Gary,
you tell him Rick was lookin' for him.

20:01.488 --> 20:02.682
Rick who?

20:03.958 --> 20:06.586
The Rick that used to own
the Snow Palace.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.287
Let's hit it, Clarence.

20:10.331 --> 20:11.730
No, wait a sec.

20:13.234 --> 20:15.202
I didn't know you were
still in circulation.

20:15.269 --> 20:16.736
Do I look dead?

20:18.606 --> 20:20.164
Make the call, Paul.

20:24.111 --> 20:25.510
Clarence?

20:28.249 --> 20:29.307
Yeah.

20:30.651 --> 20:32.881
Yeah, little guy
with a big mouth. It's legit.

20:36.190 --> 20:38.351
You make this one deal
and you could split.

20:40.294 --> 20:42.125
Yeah, I know where it is,

20:42.896 --> 20:44.693
and don't forget my points.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.132
Yeah.

20:52.373 --> 20:53.738
You're on, swan.

22:00.140 --> 22:01.334
I don't like this.

22:01.408 --> 22:02.602
Me neither.

22:03.077 --> 22:04.009
Let's go.

22:05.045 --> 22:06.239
Wait... wait... wait... wait.

22:07.081 --> 22:08.173
I heard something.

22:08.248 --> 22:09.306
What?

22:09.683 --> 22:10.741
A click.

22:10.818 --> 22:12.581
You're absolutely right.

22:16.023 --> 22:17.251
Oh, my goodness.

22:18.092 --> 22:20.026
This is why
I don't like this.

22:20.094 --> 22:22.927
Now, get your hands up nice and high,
where I can see 'em.

22:24.631 --> 22:26.155
What's that?
What?

22:26.533 --> 22:27.693
I heard somethin'.

22:27.801 --> 22:28.790
What?

22:28.869 --> 22:30.302
Another click.

22:30.371 --> 22:32.066
You're right again.

22:32.339 --> 22:33.897
Stand very still, please.

22:45.519 --> 22:47.646
Would you give him
your gun, please?

22:51.091 --> 22:52.251
Thanks, guys.

22:52.793 --> 22:55.261
Can you wait outside?
I don't want any witnesses.

22:55.329 --> 22:56.523
I got you.

23:05.172 --> 23:07.265
What you gonna do?
Rip me off?

23:08.075 --> 23:10.441
No, gonna talk.

23:12.413 --> 23:14.472
About that girl you were
with the other night.

23:14.548 --> 23:17.108
Hey, man,
the cops already cleared me on that.

23:18.352 --> 23:19.819
Who the hell are you,
a boyfriend?

23:19.887 --> 23:21.013
Just a friend.

23:21.088 --> 23:22.487
So was I,
I didn't kill her.

23:22.556 --> 23:23.750
Convince me.

23:24.224 --> 23:27.455
Look, man, l... I was with her
on the beach that night.

23:27.828 --> 23:30.558
But I split and that's
the last I see of her.

23:30.631 --> 23:31.529
And Kacy?

23:31.632 --> 23:33.065
Asleep, totally zonked.

23:33.133 --> 23:34.464
On the beach?
Yeah.

23:34.535 --> 23:36.799
And you left her there?
Oh, come on, man!

23:38.872 --> 23:40.203
Where did you go
from the beach?

23:40.274 --> 23:42.242
I went back to the club.
I had business.

23:42.743 --> 23:45.974
Yeah, and I'll bet you've got about
16 witnesses that can place you there.

23:46.046 --> 23:47.070
I do.

23:51.618 --> 23:53.245
Tell you what, Gary,

23:55.189 --> 23:57.248
I'm gonna make
a deal with you.

23:58.158 --> 24:01.127
You see, even if you didn't kill her,
I hate dealers.

24:02.062 --> 24:04.860
Now, you come up with something
that maybe can help me,

24:04.932 --> 24:07.560
then just maybe
I'll let you walk out of here.

24:08.035 --> 24:09.764
Man, it's really dark
out there at night.

24:09.837 --> 24:12.237
There was nobody there,
maybe a bum.

24:13.307 --> 24:14.433
All right. Look,

24:14.508 --> 24:16.476
if I give you a name,
maybe that will help

24:16.543 --> 24:17.874
and then we'll be square,
right?

24:17.945 --> 24:19.640
Give me the name.
Nick.

24:19.713 --> 24:21.510
He's a juicehead,
lives down on the beach,

24:21.582 --> 24:24.278
somewhere near
that... that banana grove.

24:24.351 --> 24:26.376
I seen him later that night
after I split the club.

24:26.453 --> 24:27.681
He was feeling no pain.

24:28.655 --> 24:29.917
Did you tell that
to the cops?

24:29.990 --> 24:31.958
They didn't ask me, man.

24:32.426 --> 24:34.360
Look, wait, look,
let me tell you something.

24:34.428 --> 24:36.658
I think that that guy Nick
is your guy.

24:37.097 --> 24:38.121
You know, he...

24:38.198 --> 24:41.292
he's a real loser, man, he... he...
he paddles with one oar.

24:42.669 --> 24:45.137
Yeah, sure.

24:48.242 --> 24:50.210
Don't go
on any vacations.

25:17.838 --> 25:20.739
<i>There are some things</i>
<i>you never forget.</i>

25:21.074 --> 25:23.008
<i>I know you're thinking</i>
<i>I've gotta be crazy,</i>

25:23.076 --> 25:25.510
<i>but walking</i>
<i>through this place was...</i>

25:25.579 --> 25:27.672
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it brought back feelings.</i>

25:28.148 --> 25:30.639
<i>And there was only one place</i>
<i>I ever felt like this.</i>

26:25.288 --> 26:26.414
Nick?

26:29.826 --> 26:31.657
Nick, put the gun down.

26:33.663 --> 26:35.858
Come on, Nick,
take a good look at me.

26:40.636 --> 26:41.694
I'm sorry.

26:47.243 --> 26:48.232
I know you.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.936
I- I've seen you before,
right?

26:55.551 --> 26:57.018
In my company...

26:57.086 --> 26:59.077
You're in my company,
right?

26:59.589 --> 27:02.319
No. No, I'm Thomas Magnum.

27:06.863 --> 27:08.728
But I-I've seen you before.

27:12.135 --> 27:13.762
Hey, you want some?

27:14.337 --> 27:15.736
No, thanks.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.035
How long have you
been living here?

27:20.176 --> 27:21.302
I, uh,

27:21.644 --> 27:25.045
I came over here in 1967, sir,
I've been here ever since.

27:26.315 --> 27:27.976
Nick, this is Hawaii.

27:30.353 --> 27:31.342
Yeah.

27:32.755 --> 27:34.620
Yeah, Hawaii, l... I know.

27:38.494 --> 27:41.292
I just, uh,
forget sometimes.

27:42.799 --> 27:44.733
That ever happen to you?

27:46.335 --> 27:47.302
Yeah.

27:50.973 --> 27:51.997
Nick.

27:52.708 --> 27:54.141
Why don't you
come back with me?

27:54.210 --> 27:55.507
I know some guys
who can help.

27:55.578 --> 27:57.170
They know what
you're going through.

27:57.246 --> 27:58.804
No, no.
I- I've been there.

27:59.215 --> 28:01.342
Man, I have been
in your hospitals,

28:01.751 --> 28:03.150
so you forget it.

28:04.687 --> 28:07.178
Don't you even think about taking
me back, do you understand?

28:07.256 --> 28:08.223
Okay,

28:09.258 --> 28:11.089
I'm not going to pressure.

28:11.260 --> 28:12.784
That's good.

28:15.731 --> 28:17.255
You know, l... I like...

28:18.167 --> 28:19.429
I like living alone here,

28:19.502 --> 28:21.936
so maybe, I was thinking,
you can just stop.

28:22.038 --> 28:23.232
Just go away.

28:25.641 --> 28:27.609
L... I will in a minute, Nick.

28:28.377 --> 28:30.845
There... there was
a friend of mine

28:31.747 --> 28:34.773
who was killed on the beach
near here the other night.

28:36.752 --> 28:38.276
Maybe you saw it.

28:41.457 --> 28:43.652
Well, I see
a lot of killing.

28:46.662 --> 28:49.222
Especially when l...
when I close my eyes.

28:51.667 --> 28:54.659
And sometimes,
when I open them

28:56.472 --> 28:57.939
it's still there.

29:00.877 --> 29:02.310
Was it there
the other night?

29:02.378 --> 29:03.936
Did you see anything
the other night?

29:04.013 --> 29:06.277
Yeah, maybe.

29:08.718 --> 29:10.982
Maybe... maybe
I've seen her killed,

29:11.053 --> 29:12.850
maybe I just...

29:19.595 --> 29:23.361
Any-anyhow the guy was NVA,
wasn't VC, I know that.

29:27.270 --> 29:28.328
Oh, Nick.

29:30.740 --> 29:31.729
What?

29:36.112 --> 29:37.238
I know.

29:39.348 --> 29:40.872
I know I'm nuts.

29:42.952 --> 29:44.647
Funny, isn't it?

29:47.089 --> 29:48.716
L... I really know it.

29:50.860 --> 29:52.452
But it doesn't help.

29:54.730 --> 29:55.890
Nick, come with me.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.999
No, I can't.

30:02.605 --> 30:04.402
Out there I'm just, uh...

30:07.910 --> 30:10.401
I'm gonna kill somebody, man.
L... l... I...

30:11.514 --> 30:14.108
I'm gonna waste them,
just like I did before.

30:17.620 --> 30:18.985
But here I...

30:20.957 --> 30:22.857
I ain't gonna hurt
nobody here.

30:26.729 --> 30:28.458
Unless, of course, uh,

30:30.900 --> 30:32.800
they try to take me back.

31:00.463 --> 31:01.725
Kelly?

31:03.099 --> 31:04.327
Magnum?

31:12.241 --> 31:13.765
Where's Sergeant Jordan?

31:13.843 --> 31:15.310
He's inside.

31:15.378 --> 31:17.608
Does he always start
his shift with a drink?

31:17.680 --> 31:20.274
I think he's questioning
the bartender.

31:20.349 --> 31:21.475
Without you?

31:22.718 --> 31:25.050
You know, he thinks
I'm a bit green.

31:25.521 --> 31:26.453
Sure.

31:27.423 --> 31:29.448
You guys come up
with anything yet?

31:30.159 --> 31:32.059
Yeah, we know
she was asphyxiated.

31:32.128 --> 31:34.323
And she had sex
shortly before she died.

31:34.397 --> 31:36.365
That's about it.
How about you?

31:36.565 --> 31:40.001
I'm checking out a local,
a guy by the name of Nick. Beach bum.

31:40.636 --> 31:41.830
Yeah?
What's his last name?

31:41.904 --> 31:42.928
Wait a while on him.

31:43.005 --> 31:45.030
I'm pretty sure he had nothing
to do with any of this.

31:45.107 --> 31:46.199
Let me do
more checking.

31:46.275 --> 31:49.176
Hey, wait a minute. This is supposed
to be a 2-way street, remember.

31:49.245 --> 31:51.611
Now, I could get into a lot of
trouble just talking to you.

31:51.681 --> 31:53.239
Come on,
just give me 24 hours.

31:53.315 --> 31:54.475
Magnum.

31:55.685 --> 31:56.982
Thomas Magnum.

31:57.720 --> 32:00.314
Didn't anybody ever tell you the
big money is in divorce cases?

32:00.389 --> 32:01.321
Let's go.

32:36.559 --> 32:38.618
<i>Kelly was pretty nice</i>
<i>about not pressing</i>

32:38.694 --> 32:41.026
<i>the thing with Nick</i>
<i>in front of the Sarge.</i>

32:41.097 --> 32:44.965
<i>Even so, in 24 hours I was going to</i>
<i>have to make some kind of decision.</i>

32:45.534 --> 32:46.967
<i>I just wondered, though,</i>

32:47.503 --> 32:48.868
<i>if I had the right,</i>

32:49.238 --> 32:51.035
<i>the right to mess</i>
<i>with Nick's life.</i>

32:52.775 --> 32:56.438
<i>I figured the best thing to do was to</i>
<i>try taking another tack with the case.</i>

32:56.679 --> 32:58.306
<i>Nuts and bolts</i>
<i>kind of footwork.</i>

32:58.380 --> 33:00.348
<i>Hanging out at the beach,</i>
<i>whatever.</i>

33:00.416 --> 33:02.247
<i>Maybe I'd get lucky</i>
<i>and spot something.</i>

33:03.385 --> 33:05.717
<i>Turns out I got lucky</i>
<i>sitting right where I was.</i>

33:05.788 --> 33:07.050
It's for you.

33:07.123 --> 33:08.055
Thanks.

33:08.724 --> 33:09.884
Magnum.

33:13.929 --> 33:14.918
<i>I don't like it.</i>

33:15.431 --> 33:17.524
Somebody calls you
out of the clear blue,

33:17.600 --> 33:21.229
tells you to meet Gary on a
clearing on the back side of Maui,

33:21.303 --> 33:23.294
they're gonna give you
the scam on Kacy?

33:23.739 --> 33:24.763
I don't like it.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.967
Well, I'm not particularly
fond of it, either.

33:27.042 --> 33:29.067
Well, good. Then I'll turn
around and we can go home.

33:29.145 --> 33:30.476
There ain't
no sense in us...

33:30.546 --> 33:32.605
Come on, T.C.,
this is our last shot.

33:32.681 --> 33:36.048
I don't want to see Kacy go into the
"Unsolved" file at HPD without knowing

33:36.118 --> 33:37.847
I did everything I could,
okay?

33:44.160 --> 33:45.149
You see it?

33:45.227 --> 33:46.159
No.

33:46.228 --> 33:47.126
Good.

33:50.699 --> 33:52.690
Don't you know
what goes on down there?

33:52.768 --> 33:55.202
Yeah.
A whole lot of drug business.

33:55.271 --> 33:58.900
Yeah, but they don't like outsiders
pokin' their noses into their homegrown.

33:58.974 --> 34:00.908
They like
to keep things quiet.

34:00.976 --> 34:04.742
You don't see them put up signs
down there saying "Drug Depot...

34:04.814 --> 34:07.476
Last chance to get high
before the mainland."

34:08.016 --> 34:09.313
There it is.

34:14.422 --> 34:16.583
Could you put it down here?

34:16.992 --> 34:18.458
Uh-huh.

34:19.195 --> 34:21.493
Boy, I can see trouble coming.

34:21.563 --> 34:22.757
What?

34:30.438 --> 34:31.804
T.C.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.472
Yeah, I know.
Keep the meter running.

35:14.683 --> 35:16.116
You better hold on.

35:21.423 --> 35:22.947
You're gonna owe me for this.

35:23.025 --> 35:24.014
I'm sorry.

35:24.093 --> 35:26.220
Well, that just
changes everything.

35:26.295 --> 35:27.592
Come on, T.C.

35:27.663 --> 35:30.461
"Come on, T.C."
Don't T.C. Me.

35:30.532 --> 35:32.295
Aw, forget it.
Just forget it.

35:34.837 --> 35:36.566
Oh, you've gotta
forget it, Thomas.

35:36.639 --> 35:37.833
You just gotta forget it.

35:39.041 --> 35:40.941
Well, you have done
everything you can do.

35:41.010 --> 35:42.875
Yeah. Including almost
getting us killed.

35:42.945 --> 35:45.971
Well, it's obvious that Kacy was mixed
up some pretty heavy-duty people.

35:46.048 --> 35:47.811
So you guys walked
right into a delivery.

35:47.883 --> 35:49.282
Well, I've known her
a long time.

35:49.351 --> 35:51.114
I guess I just don't
want to believe it.

35:51.186 --> 35:52.210
Oh, come on.

35:52.288 --> 35:54.552
You gonna tell me,
paddling around a surfboard together

35:54.623 --> 35:57.353
a couple of mornings a week
constitutes a meaningful relationship?

35:57.426 --> 36:00.224
No. But picking up 3 bullet
holes in my Plexiglas does.

36:00.296 --> 36:02.491
T.C., I really will
pay for that. Honest.

36:02.564 --> 36:04.191
No, you won't.
Yes, I will.

36:04.266 --> 36:05.358
With what?

36:05.434 --> 36:07.299
The bucks your client's
paying you, Thomas?

36:07.369 --> 36:08.700
You don't have a client.

36:08.771 --> 36:11.535
Damn it, Rick,
that doesn't matter. Kacy's dead.

36:11.607 --> 36:12.904
Somebody stole her life.

36:12.975 --> 36:15.739
Now, maybe I don't know much about her,
what she did to stay alive,

36:15.811 --> 36:18.837
but I do know she enjoyed it,
she enjoyed life.

36:18.914 --> 36:21.280
And nobody has the right
to take that away from her.

36:21.350 --> 36:22.681
All right,
agreed, man.

36:22.751 --> 36:25.413
But you tell me,
what's left to do?

36:47.643 --> 36:49.235
<i>I suppose T.C. Was right.</i>

36:49.311 --> 36:50.801
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what was left to do</i>

36:50.879 --> 36:53.848
<i>except let the boys in blue know</i>
<i>about that clearing on Maui.</i>

36:55.617 --> 36:56.675
Sergeant Jordan.

36:58.654 --> 37:01.418
Well, well, well.
Private investigator.

37:01.490 --> 37:02.616
I was gonna call you.

37:02.691 --> 37:04.386
We got the guy that
murdered your friend.

37:04.460 --> 37:05.757
He just walked in
and confessed.

37:05.828 --> 37:08.422
We have it, signed, sealed,
and delivered.

37:08.497 --> 37:09.395
Who?

37:10.432 --> 37:11.660
Nick Frangakis.

37:24.545 --> 37:25.944
<i>I know, I know,</i>

37:26.014 --> 37:28.346
<i>this time I really</i>
<i>should have felt relieved.</i>

37:28.916 --> 37:30.406
<i>Everything was</i>
<i>cleanly wrapped up.</i>

37:30.485 --> 37:31.918
<i>Nice neat confession.</i>

37:32.286 --> 37:34.618
<i>Nick would live out the rest</i>
<i>of his days in a hospital.</i>

37:34.722 --> 37:36.155
<i>Alone with his demons.</i>

37:37.492 --> 37:38.857
<i>Only thing was,</i>

37:39.093 --> 37:41.391
<i>somehow I felt</i>
<i>he wasn't alone with them.</i>

37:42.397 --> 37:43.728
<i>They were mine, too.</i>

37:43.865 --> 37:46.231
How long is he
gonna be out there?

37:46.300 --> 37:48.461
Till he gets it out of his system,
I guess.

37:50.605 --> 37:51.799
Or he drowns
from exhaustion.

37:51.873 --> 37:53.636
He's been out there
an hour and a half.

37:57.045 --> 37:58.239
Here he comes.

38:17.632 --> 38:19.429
Guys, I've gotta
talk to him.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.933
I gotta see him.

38:21.469 --> 38:23.403
Guess he didn't get it
out of his system.

38:24.872 --> 38:26.066
He should.

38:26.140 --> 38:29.200
Cops found the guy who killed her.
It's time to move on.

38:29.277 --> 38:31.507
I don't think
Nick was the killer.

38:32.146 --> 38:33.340
He confessed.

38:34.615 --> 38:36.981
Come on. You know
what he went through.

38:37.051 --> 38:39.679
Some of us can deal
with it better than others.

38:39.754 --> 38:42.382
Now, we can close our eyes
and forget.

38:42.457 --> 38:44.322
He closes his
and remembers.

38:46.260 --> 38:47.852
He didn't kill Kacy.

38:49.897 --> 38:51.558
He just wishes he did.

39:02.410 --> 39:04.571
What are you
doing here, Magnum?

39:04.645 --> 39:05.771
Wanna join the force?

39:05.847 --> 39:09.510
No, not exactly.
I want to see Nick.

39:10.051 --> 39:11.075
You do, huh?

39:11.519 --> 39:12.611
You his lawyer?

39:12.687 --> 39:15.588
Oh, come on, Jordan. In one hour I
can be back down here with a lawyer

39:15.656 --> 39:17.385
and you'll have to
let me see him anyway.

39:17.458 --> 39:20.154
Fine, you can talk to the Captain
'cause I'll be off duty by then.

39:20.228 --> 39:22.628
You're off duty a lot lately,
aren't you?

39:22.697 --> 39:23.857
Surfrider?

39:25.133 --> 39:26.623
Don't push me.

39:27.101 --> 39:30.070
Look, you know as well as
I do he didn't kill her.

39:31.139 --> 39:33.334
All I know is that we have
ourselves a confession.

39:33.407 --> 39:34.840
I want to see him.

39:36.310 --> 39:37.971
Get yourself
out of this stationhouse

39:38.045 --> 39:40.013
before you have yourself
an accident.

39:41.983 --> 39:43.883
Okay, but I'll be back.

39:44.452 --> 39:45.885
I wanna tell you
in the meantime,

39:45.953 --> 39:47.545
I'm holding you
personally responsible

39:47.622 --> 39:49.681
for his health and welfare,
you understand that?

39:49.757 --> 39:51.452
Who are you talking to?
Hey, Hey.

39:51.526 --> 39:52.788
Get him out of here.

39:53.394 --> 39:54.622
Get out of here!

39:59.600 --> 40:00.658
Kelly!
Don't ask.

40:00.735 --> 40:02.293
I gotta see him.
It would be my badge.

40:02.370 --> 40:03.428
You'll lose more than that

40:03.504 --> 40:05.699
if I come back here and find
out he's had an accident

40:05.773 --> 40:07.138
like hanging himself
in his cell.

40:07.208 --> 40:08.675
You think I'm
causing a stink now?

40:08.743 --> 40:10.176
All right.
Damn it, Kelly.

40:10.244 --> 40:11.336
All right.

40:12.046 --> 40:13.775
5 minutes, that's it.

40:15.116 --> 40:16.606
After that, you had
just better stay

40:16.684 --> 40:18.174
the hell
away from here.

40:18.319 --> 40:19.377
Come on.

40:30.731 --> 40:31.925
Hey.

40:33.801 --> 40:36.031
What are you, uh,
what are you in for?

40:36.704 --> 40:38.399
To see
how you are doin'.

40:44.879 --> 40:46.574
Can you give me
a couple of minutes?

41:07.134 --> 41:09.102
They say
you killed her, Nick.

41:11.439 --> 41:13.464
Well, I guess
that must be true.

41:15.977 --> 41:17.137
Is it?

41:19.213 --> 41:20.805
I signed a confession.

41:22.984 --> 41:24.611
Have you seen
a lawyer?

41:24.752 --> 41:27.243
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I've seen two.

41:28.556 --> 41:30.387
I don't think
you killed her, Nick.

41:32.493 --> 41:35.257
Well, it really don't matter
what you think.

41:35.529 --> 41:37.622
You know,
it's not going to make up for anything.

41:38.399 --> 41:40.799
It isn't going to change what
happened in Nam. Not a thing.

41:40.868 --> 41:42.426
Well, may-maybe
it's gonna help.

41:42.503 --> 41:43.435
Nick.

41:45.740 --> 41:48.106
No, may-maybe
it's gonna help just

41:48.175 --> 41:49.574
take it away.

41:49.877 --> 41:50.935
Take what away?

41:51.779 --> 41:52.677
Pain.

41:53.748 --> 41:56.239
Confessing to a murder
that you didn't commit

41:56.317 --> 41:58.842
isn't gonna change
what you did there,

41:58.919 --> 42:00.887
or what you think
you did there.

42:00.955 --> 42:03.287
Yeah, but look,
it don't matter no more.

42:04.992 --> 42:08.792
Don't you understand, l... I can't...
I can't go on living out there by myself

42:08.863 --> 42:10.922
in that grove.
I mean, I just...

42:12.033 --> 42:14.160
l- I-I-I'm starting
to see things,

42:14.735 --> 42:17.397
things that... that... that
don't make no sense to me.

42:18.639 --> 42:19.731
It's crazy.

42:21.208 --> 42:23.574
The pains...

42:24.745 --> 42:26.007
The... I... I just wanna...

42:26.080 --> 42:28.241
I gotta get away.
I gotta get away.

42:29.750 --> 42:31.843
I'm gonna get you
out of here,

42:31.919 --> 42:33.181
into a hospital.

42:35.556 --> 42:37.080
I've been there.

42:37.458 --> 42:38.686
So have I.

42:40.094 --> 42:41.186
You?

42:44.198 --> 42:47.861
I... l... I don't know. I mean, what...
what am I supposed to do? I just...

42:52.239 --> 42:53.228
Look.

42:53.941 --> 42:55.533
I- I've seen her.

42:56.711 --> 42:59.009
I- I've seen her
on the beach.

43:01.716 --> 43:03.115
She... she was, uh,

43:05.286 --> 43:07.447
she was with this dude,
you know,

43:09.523 --> 43:11.957
and it was, uh, it was love.

43:14.729 --> 43:16.321
And then he split.

43:17.298 --> 43:19.095
And this other guy came

43:20.868 --> 43:22.233
and killed her

43:23.637 --> 43:25.867
and I see him kill her.

43:28.743 --> 43:29.937
That's all.

43:30.578 --> 43:32.011
L... I don't have...

43:36.817 --> 43:38.284
Look, the... the guy...

43:38.886 --> 43:41.320
The guy was NVA.
NVA regular.

43:41.422 --> 43:42.946
Time's up.

43:45.159 --> 43:48.560
See, I could tell because...
because he was wearing a uniform.

44:14.422 --> 44:16.652
You know, if Sergeant Jordan
sees me here with you...

44:16.724 --> 44:19.090
I appreciate your coming.
Why don't we go out on the beach?

44:19.160 --> 44:20.957
It's a lot more
quiet down there.

44:21.028 --> 44:21.960
Okay.

44:28.702 --> 44:29.964
I've got to tell you,
Magnum.

44:30.037 --> 44:32.631
This has to be
the last time I talk to you.

44:32.706 --> 44:34.071
I really think
Nick did it.

44:34.141 --> 44:35.301
Yeah, yeah,
I know,

44:35.376 --> 44:37.936
just bear with me a minute,
because if I'm right...

44:40.014 --> 44:42.539
If I'm right,
I think I'm gonna need your help.

44:43.884 --> 44:44.873
See,

44:45.352 --> 44:48.082
I've been thinking about
the night Kacy was killed.

44:49.457 --> 44:51.186
It's a lot like tonight.

44:51.258 --> 44:52.520
Warm breeze,

44:52.793 --> 44:54.283
music playing.

44:55.896 --> 44:57.454
And after Gary left,

44:59.467 --> 45:01.435
I bet she went
for a swim.

45:02.603 --> 45:03.592
See?

45:05.639 --> 45:08.073
See the way the waves
are settin' up?

45:10.177 --> 45:12.407
That's just the way
she liked them.

45:14.615 --> 45:16.310
I heard she was a champ.

45:17.084 --> 45:17.982
Yeah,

45:18.886 --> 45:19.944
anyway,

45:22.423 --> 45:23.947
she gets
out of the water,

45:24.024 --> 45:25.252
feeling real good,

45:25.326 --> 45:27.260
feeling really good,
on top of the worid.

45:27.328 --> 45:29.888
About that time,
this guy comes up to her,

45:29.964 --> 45:31.761
and maybe
she knows him.

45:32.700 --> 45:33.632
And he...

45:34.835 --> 45:36.097
He knows her.

45:36.170 --> 45:38.832
Sees that maybe
she's a little loaded.

45:39.540 --> 45:41.030
Figures,
"Hey, maybe I can score

45:41.108 --> 45:43.076
a little action.
Who's gonna know?"

45:44.545 --> 45:45.842
I mean, after all,

45:47.882 --> 45:50.715
his partner's in the bar
having a beer with Ralph.

45:53.787 --> 45:55.755
What are you
trying to pull here?

45:55.823 --> 45:57.688
The truth out of you,
Kelly.

45:57.758 --> 46:00.693
Nick isn't that crazy.
He saw a uniform on the beach that night

46:00.761 --> 46:01.989
but it wasn't NVA.

46:02.830 --> 46:04.161
It was yours.

46:04.732 --> 46:06.700
You're just as nuts
as he is.

46:06.767 --> 46:08.132
The telephone call,

46:08.202 --> 46:10.670
sending me into that dope deal,
I checked.

46:10.738 --> 46:12.171
You and Jordan
were working drugs

46:12.239 --> 46:14.173
in that area
until a month ago.

46:15.809 --> 46:17.140
So, you see, Kelly,

46:18.045 --> 46:19.672
it had to be
one of you.

46:20.114 --> 46:21.672
And he was
in the Surfrider.

46:21.749 --> 46:23.410
I checked that, too.

46:25.452 --> 46:26.510
Prove it.

46:34.628 --> 46:36.391
Just hold it
right there.

46:42.803 --> 46:44.327
It was an accident,
Magnum.

46:45.372 --> 46:47.397
She just wouldn't
stop screaming.

46:48.776 --> 46:50.471
She just had to
keep screaming.

46:51.812 --> 46:54.474
You think I'm gonna ruin my
life over a tramp like that?

46:54.548 --> 46:55.674
No.

46:59.253 --> 47:01.744
We're gonna take
a little walk.

47:04.258 --> 47:05.885
Come on, move it.

47:06.126 --> 47:07.525
Move it!

47:10.698 --> 47:11.824
Kelly!

47:13.033 --> 47:14.159
Drop it.

47:15.736 --> 47:17.033
Drop it.

47:32.019 --> 47:33.418
See you around,
Magnum.

47:41.328 --> 47:42.886
You know the words,
don't you?

47:44.031 --> 47:45.862
You've said 'em enough.

47:46.767 --> 47:48.462
Now you're gonna
hear 'em.

47:49.136 --> 47:51.263
You have the right
to remain silent.

47:51.338 --> 47:53.135
Anything you say
can and will be used

47:53.207 --> 47:54.674
against you
in a court of law.

47:54.742 --> 47:56.676
You have the right
to speak with an attorney,

47:56.744 --> 47:58.439
and to have
an attorney present...

48:06.186 --> 48:08.916
<i>The surfing competition was</i>
<i>as exciting as ever.</i>

48:08.989 --> 48:10.217
<i>With one exception:</i>

48:10.858 --> 48:12.086
<i>Kacy wasn't there.</i>

48:12.493 --> 48:15.223
<i>I went to it as a way</i>
<i>of saying goodbye.</i>

48:15.596 --> 48:18.463
<i>Then I realized I really</i>
<i>didn't need to do that.</i>

48:18.932 --> 48:22.595
<i>Kacy's life was the water,</i>
<i>something that would always be with us</i>

48:22.970 --> 48:24.870
<i>and I knew that</i>
<i>she would, too.</i>
