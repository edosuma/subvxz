WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:04.738
(whimpers, crying)

00:04.772 --> 00:05.839
(screams)

00:05.873 --> 00:08.008
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.147
(motors revving)

00:13.181 --> 00:16.784
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.221
- Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:20.254 --> 00:22.056
- Not many butcher shops

00:22.090 --> 00:24.692
with a classic literature
section.

00:24.725 --> 00:28.229
- This about my son?
- It's about you, Ignacio.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.030
I have so many questions.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.432
- I fucked up.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.933
I was supposed to kill
both of them.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.702
The job came in
through Packer.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.204
- It came from Mexico.

00:36.237 --> 00:39.073
- Yeah, he's anal
about keeping records.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.509
He might have more details.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.010
I'll get whatever I can
from Packer.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.114
After that, we're clean.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.849
- Morning.
Marlon will help you.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.584
- Marlon?
- Hi.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.386
This is everything?
- Yes.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.054
- Great.
- I believe it is.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.055
- Okay.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.392
- Mercs got Adelita.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.461
Gotta meet Alvarez and Galindo
at the warehouse.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.131
Angel, set up
in the Ariza tunnel.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.465
We need someone on comms.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.733
- What?
Oh, fuck no.

01:05.766 --> 01:06.967
I gotta be on this.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.068
- Until we table
what happened in Berdoo,

01:08.102 --> 01:09.603
you take a step back.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.472
- Man, fuck you.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.642
It's my kid!

01:14.675 --> 01:17.645
Adelita--it's my fucking kid!

01:17.678 --> 01:19.613
- You pick your crew.
Go get Adelita.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.082
- It's the fucking M.C.

01:23.684 --> 01:24.718
- Hold on!

01:26.620 --> 01:28.922
- Oh, Jesus. Thank God.

01:28.956 --> 01:32.393
- You have to go.
I need you to keep it going.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.994
We'll be fine.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.729
- Please don't.
- You have to let me go.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.565
- We gotta go now!
Go!

02:12.733 --> 02:14.368
- Shut the fuck up!

02:14.402 --> 02:16.437
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.878
What?
They're very loud.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.014
- Yeah, I guess so.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.690
- You don't gotta
stay here, man.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.626
I'm not gonna
fucking off myself.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.228
- Actually, I'm just here
to protect the birds.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.833
- Yeah, well,
the birds appreciate it.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.504
- Breakfast?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.722
- Got the call from San Diego.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.426
Adelita's been delivered
safe and sound.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.927
She's now resting comfortably

03:13.961 --> 03:16.163
at the 32nd Street
Naval Station.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.398
- Medical workup?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.733
- Both mother
and child are fine.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.736
- Oh, that's something,
isn't it?

03:22.770 --> 03:26.907
And, uh, what magic...

03:26.940 --> 03:30.177
have our friends in
la Policía Estatal conjured up?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.346
- Nothing.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.581
They couldn't get anything
off the car.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.015
It was burned to the bone.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.584
- Course it was.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.722
- Someone
intercepted that car,

03:41.755 --> 03:43.957
figured out Adelita was behind
door number three.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.397
- Policía said that when
they got to the scene,

03:49.430 --> 03:52.733
Adelita was just...
standing there.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.570
The other car was too far
to pursue.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.072
Must have been someone
who was spooked by the sirens.

04:00.908 --> 04:04.645
A local crew,
a random carjack?

04:04.678 --> 04:07.548
- Are 1989 Crown Vic wagons
topping

04:07.581 --> 04:10.384
the most stolen vehicle chart
these days?

04:10.418 --> 04:13.554
Big demand in the white trash
mothers market, maybe.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.955
- Then who goes
to all that trouble

04:14.988 --> 04:17.157
and leaves the prize behind?

04:17.190 --> 04:20.260
The rebels would have
taken on the cops.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.430
Even your suspicion
about Galindo,

04:22.463 --> 04:25.966
if the cartel wanted her,
they would have her.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.673
- It's all a bit upside down,
isn't it?

04:32.706 --> 04:35.175
Oh, well.

04:35.208 --> 04:39.680
You know what they say
about drastic confusion.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.982
- No, I don't.
What do they say?

04:47.455 --> 04:49.923
- You should have your plebes
pack all this up,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.859
head to San Diego.

04:51.892 --> 04:55.496
I believe Admiral Davidson
has accommodations for us.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.637
Ahoy, matey.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.623
- * Oh, Lord

05:22.656 --> 05:26.360
* Have mercy on me

05:33.066 --> 05:38.472
* Oh, Lord, have mercy on me

05:44.177 --> 05:47.147
* If I done anybody wrong

06:02.095 --> 06:03.664
- Did you sleep at all?

06:06.534 --> 06:07.901
Not really.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.677
- What happens now?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.880
- I suppose...nothing.

06:21.715 --> 06:25.453
We just keep doing
what we've been doing

06:25.486 --> 06:27.320
and hope it doesn't
come unglued.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.964
- I'm sure that's why
Adelita did what she did,

06:36.997 --> 06:40.067
knowing you would
keep moving things forward

06:40.100 --> 06:41.301
without her.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.140
- Excuse me.
Just heard from Marcus.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.042
His Escalade died.
I'm gonna go pick him up.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.611
Luis is inside.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.112
Mondo and Batan
are at the gate.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.847
- Okay. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.958
I should get dressed.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.326
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:39.359 --> 07:41.094
Fuck out here.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.399
- It's the trucks
that passed us.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.368
- Stay with them.
Get help.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.143
- Who the fuck are you guys?

08:45.058 --> 08:47.995
- * Mother of exiles

08:48.028 --> 08:50.230
* The torch of hope

08:50.263 --> 08:53.000
* In the toss of the tempest

08:53.033 --> 08:55.703
* Threw us Madison's rope

08:55.736 --> 08:58.205
* But the brazen giant

08:58.238 --> 09:01.108
* With limbs astride

09:01.141 --> 09:04.244
* Blocks the golden door

09:04.277 --> 09:08.015
* To the U.S. of Lies

09:08.048 --> 09:12.085
* Damn your huddled masses

09:12.119 --> 09:15.022
* Scrub our floors

09:15.055 --> 09:17.257
* Cut our grasses

09:17.290 --> 09:20.260
* I am a wolf

09:20.293 --> 09:22.562
* A wild cur

09:22.596 --> 09:24.698
* Cut from the pack

09:26.634 --> 09:28.802
* With blood on my fur

09:28.836 --> 09:31.639
* Every howl

09:31.672 --> 09:34.441
* Marks the debt

09:34.474 --> 09:37.945
* 'Cause a beaten dog

09:39.346 --> 09:42.916
* Never forgets

09:42.950 --> 09:45.619
* Every howl

09:45.653 --> 09:48.421
* Marks the debt

09:48.455 --> 09:53.260
* 'Cause a beaten dog

09:53.293 --> 09:56.063
* Never forgets

09:58.832 --> 10:01.769
* Never forgets

10:35.135 --> 10:36.837
- What up, Angel?
- 'Sup?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.872
Hey, bro.
- You good?

10:38.906 --> 10:40.974
- Mm-hmm.
Where's Coco and Gilly?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.443
- Gilly's with the Chinese.
Coco's with his kid.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.345
- Bailing Letty out?

10:45.378 --> 10:46.847
- Something to do
with her school.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.115
Should be back soon.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.283
- Come on, brother.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.319
Let's get you all cleaned up.
You smell like shit.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.554
- All right.

10:54.587 --> 10:58.859
- So big brother...
how is he?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.360
- He's fucked up.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.263
But not broken.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.200
Something shifted.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.972
- Keep him close.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.373
- Absolutely.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.323
- We got a tail.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.061
Black Escalade.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.897
- Alpha, we got glue.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.403
- Let's do it.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.175
- Oh, fuck.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.264
- Hi.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.233
Come on in.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.406
- The kids at school?

12:19.439 --> 12:23.043
- Yeah, city bus.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.145
Please, sit.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.082
- What's going on?

12:30.750 --> 12:34.387
- Uh...after the deadline,

12:34.421 --> 12:37.757
I began to look through
the Agra Park bids

12:37.791 --> 12:40.460
on my own, just curiosity.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.296
- And?

12:43.330 --> 12:46.666
- Looks like ChinAgra
has the best offer.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.136
They had the largest investment
into the town.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.104
Even their tax credits
were lower.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.774
- How is that possible?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.009
- I don't know.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.145
They were the last offer in.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.913
They came in
right under the wire.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.749
- There is no fucking way
ChinAgra came in

13:02.782 --> 13:05.152
with a lower tax credit.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.687
Someone must have given them
info on the bids.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.290
That's why they waited.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.093
- I don't know.
Maybe.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.161
- Maybe?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.333
Who was it?

13:20.367 --> 13:23.170
- I don't--
- Yes, you do.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.040
- Emily--
- Who has access to the bids?

13:27.074 --> 13:28.375
City council, Peña?

13:28.408 --> 13:29.609
- No one.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.978
Those bids are locked
in my office

13:31.011 --> 13:32.579
until the deadline.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.349
- Your office?

13:36.383 --> 13:38.018
Fuck, so your assistant...

13:38.051 --> 13:40.553
Marlon,
he'd have access.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.289
- I don't know.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.457
Marlon wouldn't--
he wouldn't do that.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.226
- Why not?
You did.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.862
- Fuck you.
- Yes, you have.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.764
- I should never...

13:54.401 --> 13:56.669
I should have never taken
your filthy money.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.338
- But you did.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.043
And now you owe me.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.080
So you're gonna tell me
what I need to know.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.682
- Jesus.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.018
Who are you?

14:13.020 --> 14:16.556
- I guess I'm just a chip
off my mother's block.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.994
Marlon, he's the only one
who had access to all the bids.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.596
And if I can prove
that he helped ChinAgra,

14:23.630 --> 14:25.565
that bid is disqualified, yes?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.002
- I guess.
- Just--

14:29.036 --> 14:31.138
- Yes.
- How much time do I have?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.943
- Tomorrow night,

14:35.976 --> 14:37.510
the board will start
reviewing the bids

14:37.544 --> 14:38.611
before the town council
meeting.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.014
- Shit.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.917
- Marlon...

14:43.951 --> 14:45.285
what are you
gonna do to him?

14:46.819 --> 14:49.056
- Talk to him.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.860
Here's some more filth.

15:50.150 --> 15:54.487
243.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.927
Two--two,

16:00.960 --> 16:04.131
four, three.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.984
- He asked me to be discreet,

16:25.018 --> 16:28.355
so I wrote it backwards
and in cursive.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.366
- Good work, Chucky.
- I accept that.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.908
- Hey.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.311
- Dude.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.247
Relax, I'm just
pulling my bedroll.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.719
The fuck is this?

16:59.752 --> 17:01.388
- Something happy.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.373
- I was in Berdoo yesterday.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.042
Told Packer I had
some bounty hunter up my ass,

17:23.076 --> 17:24.511
questioning an old job.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.713
Had him pull anything I booked
through his charter,

17:26.746 --> 17:28.281
make copies.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.849
- He keeps files on that shit?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.684
- Yeah, coded.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.687
- Have to, a lot of pieces
of the pie to be cut.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.290
Keeps us honest.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.264
- This one has the info
for your folks.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.905
- Five entries.

17:52.939 --> 17:57.244
- What's this number mean,
WU3459?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.412
- Western Union.

17:59.446 --> 18:02.949
- The last four digits
ID the branch.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.884
Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.952
- Sonora?

18:08.988 --> 18:11.224
Galindo?

18:11.258 --> 18:13.726
- Back then, could have been
Lobo Sonora too.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.062
There were more players.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.399
- Well, five payments,
somebody's obviously trying

18:19.432 --> 18:21.434
to avoid having
a big number flagged.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.735
- Most likely.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.672
- This period of time,

18:25.705 --> 18:28.341
Galindo Sr. was already
under the DOJ's thumb.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.478
If he wanted to get
anything done

18:31.511 --> 18:33.413
behind their backs,
he'd have to hide it.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.584
Bury it in household accounts.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.018
- Hey.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.953
Circle jerk's over.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.163
El Padrino's in trouble.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.464
- What happened?

18:51.498 --> 18:52.865
- We'll fill you in.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.706
- Too early for guns.

18:59.739 --> 19:03.510
- He just picked up the rest of
my parole shit from Stockton.

19:03.543 --> 19:07.046
- You know me, always a helper.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.349
- I got two men on the DL.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.550
We could use a hand.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.052
- Alvarez?

19:13.085 --> 19:15.388
Jax would want me to help.
I'm in.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.023
- Can't tell you much,

19:17.056 --> 19:19.592
other than where
to point the gun.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.829
- I'm okay with that.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.600
You good with that?
- Yes, sir.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.534
- Who attacked the station
wagon in the desert?

20:02.802 --> 20:05.037
- Who knew Adelita
was in there?

20:06.906 --> 20:08.808
- Who knew Adelita
was in there?

20:12.745 --> 20:16.883
Take off your mask...
you fucking pussy.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.961
- You hear anything else?
- Nothing.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.797
Nestor's still MIA.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.233
We ran a check
on Clearwater Towing.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.636
It's a bullshit name.
- Think it's a rival

20:36.669 --> 20:38.438
or another cartel trying
to make a play or--

20:38.471 --> 20:40.473
- No, no, there's been no push

20:40.507 --> 20:43.410
from any other family
or region.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.778
I think it's the devil we know.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.380
- Potter?
- And Hobart.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.316
- The attack on his mercs.
- Yes.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.384
- But he got Adelita.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.753
- And that confused him more.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.323
Look, Potter hates not knowing
more than he does losing.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.825
- Could be Hobart on his own,
wanting revenge.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.493
We killed four of his crew.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.501
- Luis.
- Perdón, Señor Galindo.

21:08.535 --> 21:11.571
- Emily,
what are you doing here?

21:11.604 --> 21:12.972
- We need to talk.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.975
- Here.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.649
This is not a place
where we talk.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.116
- I am sorry,
but I need you to--

21:24.150 --> 21:26.085
- I don't care what you need.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.587
I'm in the middle of something.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.955
- Yeah, so am I.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.089
- Go home.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.627
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit, Nestor.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.762
- What happened, Nestor?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.030
- Get her the fuck out of here!

21:38.064 --> 21:39.966
- You need to go now,
Mrs. Galindo.

21:54.381 --> 21:57.850
- We know it wasn't you.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.353
- We just want names.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.655
- Who attacked
the station wagon?

22:07.059 --> 22:09.128
- He's close.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.497
- Fucking go.

22:12.399 --> 22:16.135
- No!

22:16.168 --> 22:18.705
- I didn't wanna use the cell,
Mikey.

22:18.738 --> 22:22.141
Thought if this was Potter,
everything might be tapped.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.910
- I know.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.813
- The signs on the truck,
Clearwater Towing...

22:26.846 --> 22:30.182
- They're bullshit.
- They were also magnetic.

22:30.216 --> 22:32.652
One of them slid up
when it slammed into me.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.021
Caught the end
of a phone number underneath,

22:35.054 --> 22:36.756
243.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.591
- We can trace that.
- Yeah.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.092
That'd be part
of the Valley.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.694
Be 760 or 442.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.196
- Put Riz on it.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.766
- I'm gonna go find Potter.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.367
- I'll have Creeper
get him to the doc.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.737
- All good.
- Thank you.

22:50.770 --> 22:51.704
Meet back here.
- Yeah.

22:52.939 --> 22:55.642
- Hey.
- Hey, easy, will ya?

23:05.452 --> 23:09.456
It's a minefield, bro.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.723
Beautiful one.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.191
Still blow you
the fuck up.

23:21.968 --> 23:26.272
- Ooh.

23:26.305 --> 23:29.275
- You know, the little fingers
hurt the most.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.644
Heh, nine more to go.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.147
Come on.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.483
- Wait, wait!
Stop!

23:36.516 --> 23:38.951
- What?
- Stop, man.

23:38.985 --> 23:42.589
I'll tell you who it was.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.123
We used...
- Who?

23:44.156 --> 23:46.192
- Brothers.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.395
I'll give you a couple
of numbers.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.297
You text them.

23:51.330 --> 23:52.799
They'll call you back.

23:55.468 --> 23:56.936
I can get them out here.

23:58.337 --> 23:59.706
I can get them out here.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.346
- Why the fuck
would we kidnap Alvarez?

24:07.379 --> 24:08.848
- Look, I know
Potter is upside down

24:08.881 --> 24:10.182
about the attack
in the desert.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.151
He's been testing my loyalty
the whole time.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.319
Who else would have
the stones to kidnap

24:13.352 --> 24:14.987
my head of security?

24:15.021 --> 24:16.656
- Okay, listen,
Potter left this morning.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.424
So if there was anything
going on--

24:18.457 --> 24:20.760
- What?
What, you'd know about it?

24:20.793 --> 24:23.362
Come on, agent,
you're smarter than that.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.765
The shit your boss does
is above everyone's pay grade,

24:25.798 --> 24:27.199
including his.
- Okay.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.970
I'll let him know
you stopped by.

24:31.003 --> 24:34.306
- Right...like the pretty
little assistant you are.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.374
- Fuck you.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.577
- Yes, you have.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.531
- We got 16 possible numbers
in the 442 area code.

24:58.565 --> 25:01.000
- Got 12 in the 760,
most of them farms,

25:01.033 --> 25:02.468
some industrial shit.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.737
- I got a strange fucking text.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.639
"For the Molino twins.
Call burner.

25:06.673 --> 25:07.907
Need you to meet me."

25:07.940 --> 25:11.410
- "Very important job.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.212
From MA."

25:13.245 --> 25:17.149
- You got the same message?
- I did, 20 minutes ago.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.318
- MA has gotta be
Marcus Alvarez,

25:19.351 --> 25:21.721
but who the fuck
are the Molino twins?

25:23.856 --> 25:24.857
- Windmill.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.661
What, you made me read
fucking "Don Quixote."

25:28.695 --> 25:30.897
Molino means windmill
in Spanish.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.665
- Twin windmills...

25:32.699 --> 25:33.900
turbines.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.002
- Fucking farmland.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.570
- See what farms
are running with wind.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.005
Check it against the numbers.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.239
- Sí.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.314
- Andale.
- I won't be long.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.383
- Gracias, eh?

26:05.898 --> 26:07.466
- You all right?

26:07.499 --> 26:09.802
- Yes.
Thank you for doing this.

26:18.845 --> 26:22.581
- Bring any photos to share?

26:22.615 --> 26:23.950
- No.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.554
I didn't say anything
to anyone, Felipe.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.792
Miguel, Dita--
no one knows we talked.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.894
I'm sorry.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.064
- I appreciate that.

26:38.097 --> 26:41.768
At some point, I hope
that you hear the truth, Emily.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.470
If not from me, then...

26:46.706 --> 26:49.108
I'll wrap you something
to take home.

26:50.509 --> 26:52.544
- Thank you for meeting me.
- Sure.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.622
- Oh, no, I'm okay.
It's...

27:03.656 --> 27:06.458
- You're already shivering.

27:06.492 --> 27:08.961
There you go.
How's that?

27:08.995 --> 27:10.062
- Good.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.032
Thank you.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.501
- You okay?

27:15.534 --> 27:17.203
That was rough today.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.906
- It was my fault.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.276
Miguel was right.
It was a mistake to go to him.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.846
- Seemed pretty urgent.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.881
- That's why I wanted
to see you.

27:31.718 --> 27:35.221
I know I have no right
to ask you this.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.994
- Ask me what?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.798
- I need your help, EZ.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.667
I need a favor.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.669
- Okay.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.906
- This Agra Park project

27:53.940 --> 27:56.308
that Miguel and I
are working on,

27:56.342 --> 27:59.211
there's a bidding process
that we should have won.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.147
But our Chinese competitor,

28:01.180 --> 28:03.983
they bribed a clerk
in city planning.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.419
They got inside information,
so they edged us out.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.524
I need...

28:15.962 --> 28:18.330
Fuck, I'm so sorry.
I'm--I--I--

28:18.364 --> 28:20.032
- Just ask me, Em.

28:24.570 --> 28:27.073
- I need this to work, EZ.

28:29.408 --> 28:32.278
I need something to work.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.546
This project's all I have
right now,

28:34.580 --> 28:37.784
and this asshole
just undermined everything.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.919
- This what you were
gonna tell Galindo?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.890
- Yes.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.724
That's why it's a mistake
to go to him.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.894
I can't tell Miguel.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.561
- Why?
What's he gonna say?

28:49.595 --> 28:50.963
- It's not what he's gonna say.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.598
It's what he'll do.

28:52.631 --> 28:56.302
I just need to keep
the other world out of this.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.905
- And what world am I in?

29:03.142 --> 29:04.710
- Hopefully mine.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.482
- How'd you find out
about the bribe?

29:10.516 --> 29:14.620
- A friend in city planning.

29:14.653 --> 29:15.754
She got suspicious.
She--

29:20.927 --> 29:23.762
I just need somebody
to talk to him.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.932
You know, tell him
he has been found out,

29:25.965 --> 29:27.333
that we'll call the police

29:27.366 --> 29:29.268
and we'll check his phone,
his email records.

29:29.301 --> 29:32.471
We just give him a chance
to tell the truth.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.341
No charges, he walks away.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.410
- And if he doesn't?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.312
- Well, he's go to.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.950
He--well, he's just a clerk.

29:43.983 --> 29:47.619
He's not--he's not gonna
risk going to jail.

29:49.655 --> 29:50.957
That's you.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.029
- My other world.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.167
Yeah.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.935
- Yo, you done
strolling down memory lane?

30:02.969 --> 30:04.336
You told me
30 fucking minutes.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.771
- I'm finishing up.
Why?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.039
- We know
where they took Alvarez.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.774
Pick you up
at the water tower in ten.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.377
- We all good here?

30:19.886 --> 30:21.387
- I'll try.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.426
- It has to be done
by tomorrow night.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.893
- We sent the texts.
Haven't heard shit.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.463
- They sent in
the big guns, huh?

31:06.265 --> 31:09.268
Did Potter order this, or...

31:09.301 --> 31:13.072
is it just you, Hobart?

31:22.448 --> 31:26.085
- I'm just a solider doing
whatever he's got to do

31:26.118 --> 31:27.886
to stop the enemy.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.890
- Good thing
you don't ride anymore, jefe.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.232
Oh, fuck.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.368
- The brothers have
ten more minutes to respond.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.636
If not...

31:44.670 --> 31:46.372
I spike the other hand...

31:52.011 --> 31:54.080
And then I chop 'em
the fuck off.

32:19.471 --> 32:20.973
- You shouldn't be here, Mikey.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.908
- I'll be all right.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.676
I've got you to dive
in front of the bullet.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.248
- Always would, always will.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.289
- Can't see shit.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.191
- Gonna have to get closer.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.226
- Got this.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.139
The three of us
moving together

32:53.172 --> 32:54.473
kind of defeats
the whole stealth thing.

32:56.408 --> 32:59.378
I'm not suicidal,
you fucking morons.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.513
Just let me do something right.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.849
Shit.

34:32.438 --> 34:35.040
- Time's up, consejero.

34:37.343 --> 34:38.744
I think you and I both know

34:38.777 --> 34:41.012
that those names and numbers
were bullshit.

34:42.681 --> 34:46.017
Gotta say, you're one
fucking tough vato, man.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.888
- And now that you've seen
our faces,

34:49.921 --> 34:51.623
think you know
what happens next.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.302
Take point.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.441
- Oh!

35:13.345 --> 35:15.080
- Damn you, fuckers.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.120
Ah! Fuck!

35:27.393 --> 35:30.329
- Jesus Christ.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.764
- Ah, what the fuck?

35:36.702 --> 35:39.137
- Okay.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.995
- No, no.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.133
- Padrino.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.862
- Those numbers
weren't bullshit.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.599
- You should've learned
some fucking Spanish.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.217
- Let it go.
- Hey.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.620
- I'll run it by Bishop,
see what he says.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.291
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.711
- Heading out?

37:25.744 --> 37:27.446
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah.

37:29.781 --> 37:33.419
- This cleans shit up
between us.

37:33.452 --> 37:36.154
- This is cleaned up
when we find out who did it.

37:38.657 --> 37:39.858
- Yeah.

37:48.133 --> 37:49.768
- We'll find out.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.036
- I know.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.441
Gonna go check on Pop.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.108
- I'll come with.
- Why?

37:57.142 --> 37:59.110
Think I'm suicidal?

37:59.144 --> 38:01.613
- Fucking...

38:01.647 --> 38:02.948
fucking love you, bro.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.316
- Love you, Angel.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.367
- Relax, primo.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.735
I'm the one that's getting
stitched up, man.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.807
- Don't fucking scare us
like that again.

38:33.345 --> 38:36.047
- Nestor, come over here, man.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.385
- You feeling better?
- Yeah.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.690
What you did today...

38:44.723 --> 38:46.792
gives loyalty
a whole new meaning.

38:46.825 --> 38:51.296
I'm proud of you,
and I thank you, my brother.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.565
- I'm just glad you're okay,
Marcus.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.671
- Now give me some more
fucking morphine.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.006
Let me get some sleep, huh?

39:04.209 --> 39:09.347
- * If I could be like
misty roses *

39:12.551 --> 39:14.586
* I'd love you much

39:14.620 --> 39:17.423
- Sorry.
Do you need the room?

39:17.456 --> 39:19.324
I...I just didn't wanna wake
your mother.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.593
- No, uh, please...

39:23.361 --> 39:24.396
Please sit.

39:38.410 --> 39:41.379
- Before you say anything...

39:41.413 --> 39:43.048
today was my fault.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.555
Like, since this whole thing
began with Potter and Adelita,

39:49.588 --> 39:50.989
I...

39:54.325 --> 39:57.429
I enjoyed getting closer
to you, Miguel.

39:57.463 --> 40:01.900
More...inside,

40:01.933 --> 40:04.603
as your mother would call it.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.938
I felt needed.
I--

40:06.972 --> 40:09.240
- You are.
You are needed.

40:09.274 --> 40:12.811
- Yeah, okay, but...

40:12.844 --> 40:16.582
like, the boundaries now
between the worlds,

40:16.615 --> 40:18.283
just harder to see.

40:18.316 --> 40:19.818
- I know. I know. I know.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.188
Um...

40:26.124 --> 40:27.926
I'm so sorry, mi amor.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.695
- It's okay.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.703
- What did you need today?

40:40.438 --> 40:44.142
- Oh, it was silly.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.812
I ended up making one call.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.213
It was handled.

40:49.715 --> 40:52.217
- Hmm.
- Nothing to worry about.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.254
I'm gonna check on Dita.

41:17.643 --> 41:22.113
- Mm.
Mm-hmm.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.719
Get out.

42:03.955 --> 42:07.425
Have the NSA, ICE,
and our friends at CISEN

42:07.458 --> 42:10.862
pull everything they have
on those two names.

43:00.946 --> 43:02.480
- Who is it?

43:02.513 --> 43:05.951
- Ezekiel Reyes.
Can I talk to you?

43:10.188 --> 43:11.456
- EZ Reyes?

43:11.489 --> 43:13.591
Shit.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.593
All-Valley pitcher?

43:15.627 --> 43:17.295
Marlon Buksar.

43:17.328 --> 43:20.131
I was a few years behind you,
played freshman ball.

43:22.768 --> 43:25.070
- Oh, right.
Right.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.806
- Uh...oh.

43:27.839 --> 43:31.576
Uh...heard about this shit.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.345
You took a pretty hard
left turn, huh?

43:35.847 --> 43:37.515
- Yeah, I guess so.

43:37.548 --> 43:38.750
You mind if I come in?

43:38.784 --> 43:40.686
- Uh, yeah, sure.

43:44.289 --> 43:46.758
My mom's in Punta Gorda
with her friends,

43:46.792 --> 43:48.426
ceramic class.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.328
That's where she makes
all this tacky shit.

43:51.697 --> 43:53.598
- You live with your mom?

43:53.631 --> 43:55.967
- I'm in between places,
really.

43:56.001 --> 43:59.938
Uh, actually,
gonna put down a deposit

43:59.971 --> 44:02.273
on a condo next week.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.275
New units off the canal.

44:04.309 --> 44:07.112
- Wow.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.646
Things are going well
for you, Marlon.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.215
- Yeah.

44:12.851 --> 44:14.652
What do you need from me, EZ?

44:16.221 --> 44:19.324
- I just wanted to talk to you

44:19.357 --> 44:21.526
about the Agricultural Park
project.

44:23.762 --> 44:25.130
- Why?

44:25.163 --> 44:27.132
What, uh--

44:27.165 --> 44:29.000
what the fuck does that
have to do with you?

44:29.034 --> 44:30.501
- Come on, man.

44:30.535 --> 44:32.738
New car, new condo.

44:32.771 --> 44:34.840
That didn't happen
on a clerk's paycheck.

44:36.541 --> 44:39.878
- Okay, um, I think
you need to go, man.

44:41.346 --> 44:43.581
- We know the Chinese
got to you,

44:43.614 --> 44:45.383
probably made you an offer
you couldn't refuse.

44:45.416 --> 44:47.318
Maybe they even
threatened you.

44:49.287 --> 44:52.724
Cops are gonna pull your email
and phone records, Marlon.

44:52.758 --> 44:54.692
Only one way you don't
go to jail.

44:55.861 --> 44:57.695
Tell your boss the truth.

44:57.729 --> 44:59.530
You throw out the bid,
it all stays internal.

44:59.564 --> 45:00.531
No one has to know.

45:02.567 --> 45:05.703
- "We" know?

45:05.737 --> 45:07.839
You said "we."

45:07.873 --> 45:09.908
Fuck.

45:13.078 --> 45:16.114
The next best bid...

45:16.147 --> 45:17.615
Galindo.

45:17.648 --> 45:20.185
Emily Thomas.

45:20.218 --> 45:22.453
Oh, Jesus Christ.

45:22.487 --> 45:25.256
You're doing this whole
tough-guy biker shit

45:25.290 --> 45:27.292
for your old piece of ass?

45:27.325 --> 45:29.194
Dude, she is
a cartel whore now.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.262
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck, man?

45:31.296 --> 45:33.298
- The only person I'm doing
this for is you, Marlon.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.066
It's your ass on the line.

45:37.102 --> 45:39.971
Now, get me your phone
and your laptop.

45:40.005 --> 45:41.773
- No.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.243
No, fuck you.

45:45.276 --> 45:47.212
You can't make me do that.

45:47.245 --> 45:49.414
Why don't you get out
of my house?

45:49.447 --> 45:52.083
- Trust me,
this isn't gonna go your way.

45:52.117 --> 45:54.552
Even a guy living
in his mom's basement

45:54.585 --> 45:55.954
is smart enough to know that.

45:55.987 --> 46:00.125
Give me the tech.

46:00.158 --> 46:01.793
Just wanna look at it.

46:11.169 --> 46:12.904
- Okay.

46:20.812 --> 46:22.113
- Shit!

47:38.189 --> 47:40.458
-We have to talk, Angel.
-There's nothing to talk about.

47:43.428 --> 47:45.563
-(gunshot)
-What we did was personal.

47:45.596 --> 47:46.764
We broke the rules.

47:46.797 --> 47:49.534
-(rock music) * Yeah *
-(gunfire)

47:49.567 --> 47:50.801

-(crashing)
-I just want to say thanks
to the suits back there

48:29.274 --> 48:31.609
for allowing us to be here.

48:31.642 --> 48:33.644
He thinks that's
a two-way mirror.

All you have to do
is say the first thing
that comes into your head.

48:45.823 --> 48:47.258
-Yep.

49:01.339 --> 49:02.974
I'm Brittany's dad.

49:03.008 --> 49:05.476
I work
in the security industry.

49:05.510 --> 49:07.445
Have you ever
killed anybody?

49:07.478 --> 49:09.314
Uh, once.

49:11.016 --> 49:12.783
I'm just kiddin', mate.
I'm just kiddin'.
