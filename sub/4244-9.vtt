00:13.885 --> 00:16.620

- No.

TASNEEM: <i>She has</i>

00:19.524 --> 00:20.691

00:27.966 --> 00:30.033
What Haqqani wants for Saul.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.334
This is Haqqani's entire

00:32.402 --> 00:33.670
You give up these five,

00:33.672 --> 00:35.337
he basically controls

00:35.405 --> 00:36.739
Carrie, it's me.

00:36.807 --> 00:38.041
I'm here.

00:38.108 --> 00:39.742
I will not be a pawn

CARRIE: We're seeing some

00:47.416 --> 00:48.717
There are too many of 'em.

00:48.785 --> 00:49.718
What are you doing?

00:49.786 --> 00:51.486
Too many.

00:51.554 --> 00:54.056
No! I'm here. I'm here.

00:54.123 --> 00:55.190
And I am telling you

00:55.257 --> 00:57.192
it is not hopeless.

00:57.259 --> 00:59.160
There is a way.

00:59.228 --> 01:01.730
So at the alleyway,
you're gonna take a right.

Nothing good can happen

01:20.848 --> 01:22.782
in this fucked-up world
that we've made for ourselves.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.283
I need you to do

04:06.430 --> 04:08.698
Great. I'll tell
the White House.

04:08.766 --> 04:10.133
And you'll warn them
about Haqqani?

04:10.201 --> 04:11.468
You mean him getting five

04:11.536 --> 04:13.637
of his top commanders back
isn't enough bad news?

04:13.704 --> 04:15.305
I'm just saying,
give them a heads-up.

04:15.373 --> 04:16.839
About what?

04:16.906 --> 04:19.074
A theory? That's all
you've got, isn't it?

04:19.142 --> 04:20.276
Haqqani faked his death

04:20.343 --> 04:22.211
long before Saul got
on a plane to Pakistan.

04:22.279 --> 04:24.813
Getting his men back was not
part of the original plan.

04:24.881 --> 04:26.014
It's a bonus.

04:26.082 --> 04:27.383
It's a nightmare,
as is this plan

04:27.450 --> 04:28.984
you want me
to warn everyone about,

04:29.052 --> 04:31.086
even though you don't have
a clue what it is.

04:31.154 --> 04:32.921
- I'm working a source.
- Right.

04:32.989 --> 04:34.990
Your new best
friend in the ISI.

04:35.058 --> 04:38.259
Aasar Khan saved my life.

04:38.327 --> 04:41.196
Then he risked his own
to give up Dennis Boyd.

04:41.263 --> 04:42.830
But that's all he gave you.

04:42.898 --> 04:45.032
What about who's running
Boyd inside the ISI,

04:45.100 --> 04:46.901
or what they're
cooking up together?

04:46.968 --> 04:50.104
Khan was willing to identify
the breach inside <i>our</i> embassy,

04:50.172 --> 04:51.739
not betray his own people.

04:51.807 --> 04:53.373
Or he's playing you.

04:55.476 --> 04:57.578
Well, we'll know
when we talk to Boyd.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.446
(door opens)

05:08.189 --> 05:10.022
- John.
- Thanks for this.

05:10.090 --> 05:13.092
I know you got things
to do and places to be.

05:15.729 --> 05:17.396
So, uh, what's up?

05:17.464 --> 05:19.565
I need your vice on something.

05:19.633 --> 05:21.634
It's a little delicate.

05:21.702 --> 05:23.636
Grab a pew.

05:32.712 --> 05:34.346
First, can we keep this
between us?

05:34.413 --> 05:35.347
Sure.

05:35.414 --> 05:36.981
It's about Sandy Bachman.

05:37.049 --> 05:38.916
What about him?

05:38.984 --> 05:40.885
Well, he was developing
quite a rep for himself

05:40.953 --> 05:42.920
before he was killed.

05:42.988 --> 05:44.821
Generating
some spectacular intel

05:44.889 --> 05:47.591
on Taliban positions
in the tribal areas.

05:47.659 --> 05:49.260
Until he blew up
that wedding anyway.

05:49.327 --> 05:50.694
True.

05:50.762 --> 05:54.265
Plus, his methodology
wasn't exactly kosher.

05:54.332 --> 05:58.502
Turns out he was trading secrets
in exchange for the information.

05:58.570 --> 06:00.036
Jesus.

06:00.104 --> 06:02.672
We were wondering if you might
know something about that.

06:02.740 --> 06:04.039
Me?

06:04.107 --> 06:07.076
He was your friend, Dennis.
He didn't have many.

06:07.144 --> 06:09.279
Did you ever see him meeting
somebody you didn't recognize,

06:09.346 --> 06:12.181
or carrying something out of
the embassy he shouldn't have?

06:12.249 --> 06:15.785
I don't think so.
Not that I can recall anyway.

06:15.852 --> 06:17.786
This is the problem...

06:17.853 --> 06:21.890
The documents that he was
passing to the other side--

06:21.957 --> 06:24.326
they came
from your wife's computer.

06:24.394 --> 06:26.328
Martha's?

06:26.396 --> 06:29.964
I'm afraid so.

06:30.032 --> 06:32.066
You think she gave them to him?

06:32.134 --> 06:35.469
No.

06:35.537 --> 06:37.070
You think I did?

06:37.138 --> 06:38.572
- Did you?
- (scoffs)

06:38.640 --> 06:39.840
You're kidding, right?

06:39.908 --> 06:40.974
I don't know, Dennis.

06:41.042 --> 06:43.143
Like I said,
Sandy was your friend.

06:43.211 --> 06:45.746
Maybe he convinced you
it was for the war effort.

06:45.814 --> 06:47.915
- It wasn't me, John.
- You sure?

06:47.982 --> 06:49.983
'Cause if it was,
now's the time to come clean.

06:53.153 --> 06:55.087
It wasn't me, I swear.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.693
Okay.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.027
Well, look, uh...

07:01.094 --> 07:03.062
if you remember anything,
let me know.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.230
I will.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.232
I'll, uh, rack my brain.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.267
- And thanks.
- Sure.

07:18.545 --> 07:21.146
You hear that?

07:21.214 --> 07:22.481
Thought we had
him for a second.

07:22.549 --> 07:25.217
We may still.
He's making a call.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.187
- (dialing slowly)
CARRIE: - Come on.

07:31.056 --> 07:32.790
Do it.

07:32.858 --> 07:34.124
(harsh beep) _

07:34.192 --> 07:36.126
- (scoffs)
- Damn it.

07:38.930 --> 07:41.165
Now what?

07:41.233 --> 07:42.899
Thing is, our evidence is weak.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.868
If he's smart enough
to know that,

07:44.935 --> 07:46.370
he'll just keep stonewalling us.

07:46.437 --> 07:47.637
So...

07:47.705 --> 07:49.038
one step at a time.

07:49.106 --> 07:51.074
Yeah.

07:51.141 --> 07:53.009
Let him sweat
for a couple of hours, then...

07:53.077 --> 07:54.210
then grab him again,

07:54.278 --> 07:56.813
take it to the next level.

08:00.817 --> 08:02.852

(engine starts, revs)

09:45.248 --> 09:47.183
Let's go.

09:57.761 --> 09:59.695
Hi.

09:59.762 --> 10:02.531
Tell me we're doing
the right thing.

10:04.968 --> 10:07.002
Right thing's
getting Saul back.

10:17.913 --> 10:20.080
DENNIS: I already told you
I don't know anything.

10:20.148 --> 10:22.082
REDMOND:
Won't be five minutes.

10:24.152 --> 10:26.153
Thanks, John.

10:30.626 --> 10:33.026
Dennis, hi.

10:33.093 --> 10:35.395
Hi.

10:35.462 --> 10:38.364
I'd like you
to look at something.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.905
Do you recognize any of these?

10:44.972 --> 10:46.907
I don't think so.

10:46.974 --> 10:48.174
Should I?

10:48.242 --> 10:50.342
They're the documents
John mentioned to you earlier.

10:50.410 --> 10:52.244
The documents
from your wife's laptop.

10:52.311 --> 10:54.013
The ones you stole for Sandy.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.247
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

10:55.314 --> 10:57.115
- I didn't steal anything.
- You were the only on

10:57.183 --> 10:59.518
at the residence at the time
the documents were downloaded.

10:59.586 --> 11:02.087
We synced up the compute
with your keycard logs.

11:02.155 --> 11:04.456
You want to register
your protest now, Dennis?

11:04.524 --> 11:07.391
Demand a lawyer, wave
the Constitution in my face,

11:07.459 --> 11:09.393
threaten me with the wrath
of your almighty wife?

11:09.461 --> 11:12.229
Or do we just assume all
that crap, and get on with it?

11:12.297 --> 11:14.131
I'm an American citizen,
technically on American soil.

11:14.199 --> 11:16.668
You are a traitor,
and I am the fucking CIA.

11:16.735 --> 11:17.969
(chuckles)

11:22.140 --> 11:23.740
You're not going anywhere

11:23.808 --> 11:26.476
until you tell me who
Sandy's contact was at the ISI.

11:26.544 --> 11:28.411
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.746
Yes, you do.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.248
Because whoever it is,
is now running you.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.884
And whoever it is

11:33.952 --> 11:37.253
had you break into my apartment
and switch out my meds.

11:42.292 --> 11:44.860
Do you know what these are?

11:44.928 --> 11:46.996
Phenethylamine.

11:47.064 --> 11:48.998
Otherwise known as 25i.

11:49.066 --> 11:50.866
Twice as potent as LSD.

11:50.934 --> 11:52.902
I had nothing to do with that.

11:52.970 --> 11:54.536
I ended up wandering around
Islamabad

11:54.605 --> 11:55.938
in the middle of the night

11:56.006 --> 11:57.906
with no idea where I was,
or what I was doing.

11:57.974 --> 12:00.341
I'm-I'm gonna ask
for that lawyer now.

12:00.409 --> 12:01.876
You poisoned me.
I could have died out there.

12:01.944 --> 12:03.377
You think I'm gonna let you talk
to a lawyer?

12:03.445 --> 12:05.480
Sit the fuck down!

12:08.517 --> 12:10.919
(wry chuckle)

12:10.987 --> 12:12.754
(scoffs)

12:12.822 --> 12:14.089
All right.

12:14.156 --> 12:15.089
Have it your way.

12:15.156 --> 12:16.123
What are you doing?

12:16.190 --> 12:17.290
I'm saying good night.

12:17.358 --> 12:18.291
You can't just leave me here.

12:18.359 --> 12:19.292
Oh, don't worry.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.494
I'll be back.

12:25.934 --> 12:27.868
(muffled panting)

12:54.027 --> 12:56.028
(muffled panting)

13:00.399 --> 13:02.333
(men speaking Urdu)

13:19.617 --> 13:21.986
Welcome back to Islamabad.

13:22.054 --> 13:25.955
I hope your journey
was not uncomfortable.

13:32.763 --> 13:35.031
Now...

13:35.099 --> 13:36.365
by the grace of God,

13:36.433 --> 13:38.802
we will strike the heaviest blow
at the crusaders

13:38.869 --> 13:40.569
who occupy our country.

13:41.705 --> 13:43.672
How long have they flown

13:43.740 --> 13:47.876
over our homes, bombed
our weddings and funerals,

13:47.944 --> 13:49.912
murdered our women

13:49.979 --> 13:51.714
and children?

13:51.781 --> 13:54.983
We will drive them
from our skies.

13:55.051 --> 13:58.385
We will show their
crimes to the world.

13:58.453 --> 14:00.254
This man,

14:00.322 --> 14:03.925
Saul Berenson, chief of the CIA,

14:03.992 --> 14:06.894
he, by the grace of God,

14:06.962 --> 14:08.730
will bring us back
our brothers.

14:08.797 --> 14:10.765
They will march
with us to Kabul

14:10.833 --> 14:13.500
and raise the flag of God
over our country again.

14:13.568 --> 14:15.635
(cheering, shouting)

14:18.906 --> 14:20.841
(speaking Urdu)

14:34.420 --> 14:36.355
(low, indistinct conversation)

15:05.483 --> 15:07.417
(Carrie inhales deeply)

15:16.161 --> 15:18.095
(phone ringing)

15:24.101 --> 15:25.701
Hello.

15:25.769 --> 15:26.969
MIRA:
Carrie.

15:27.037 --> 15:28.204
It's Mira.

15:28.272 --> 15:32.008
Mira. Hi.

15:32.075 --> 15:33.943
I've spoken to Ambassador Boyd.

15:34.011 --> 15:36.112
She said that it's all happening
tomorrow morning.

15:36.180 --> 15:37.180
Yeah.

15:37.247 --> 15:38.547
The White House
has given its blessing.

15:38.615 --> 15:41.116
The other... parties in
the exchange are already here.

15:41.184 --> 15:42.951
By noon tomorrow,

15:43.019 --> 15:44.953
Saul will be back
in the embassy.

15:45.021 --> 15:47.189
You say that the White House
has given its blessing,

15:47.256 --> 15:48.656
but has the CIA?

15:48.724 --> 15:51.392
Wh-What do you mean?

15:51.460 --> 15:53.995
I know that giving up
these people for Saul is a loss.

15:54.063 --> 15:56.063
It's a bad loss. I know
you'll want to turn it around.

15:56.131 --> 15:58.065
Mira...

15:58.133 --> 15:59.867
I know what the CIA's like...

15:59.935 --> 16:01.335
people are expendable,
even its own people.

16:01.402 --> 16:02.336
Mira,

16:02.403 --> 16:03.503
listen to me,

16:03.571 --> 16:05.840
do not worry.

16:05.907 --> 16:08.309
Lockhart is not running
the exchange tomorrow. I am.

16:10.745 --> 16:13.046
I'm talking about you.

16:13.113 --> 16:15.648
Carrie, you're so good.

16:15.716 --> 16:17.583
You've become so good,

16:17.651 --> 16:19.953
so... professional.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.588
I know it makes Saul proud,
but...

16:22.656 --> 16:26.592
be-before the CIA,
I'm asking you to remember...

16:26.660 --> 16:28.928
just normal life.

16:28.929 --> 16:31.034
And that I love him.

16:31.097 --> 16:33.698
Saul, my husband.

16:33.766 --> 16:35.700
Yes.

16:37.370 --> 16:41.073
And I believe you do, too.

16:43.576 --> 16:45.510
(inhales)

16:45.578 --> 16:47.078
Yes.

16:47.145 --> 16:50.681
And I am begging you,
don't let him die.

16:50.749 --> 16:54.085
Just don't let him die. Just...

17:02.928 --> 17:04.861
(whimpering softly)

17:23.679 --> 17:26.281
(speaking gently in Urdu)

17:26.348 --> 17:28.284
(whimpering)

17:30.353 --> 17:33.022
(speaking gently in Urdu)

17:37.794 --> 17:39.727
(speaking gently in Urdu)

17:43.966 --> 17:45.900
Shh...

17:48.037 --> 17:50.538
Shh...

17:51.640 --> 17:53.574
Shh...

18:10.724 --> 18:12.658
(clamoring on video)

18:12.725 --> 18:14.693
- What's this?
CARRIE: - Know who that is?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.263
That's your friend,
Sandy Bachman.

18:17.331 --> 18:19.598
- My God. - Better look quick.
Soon he hasn't got a face.

18:25.072 --> 18:28.540
You think we behave badly?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.842
This is how the
other side behaves.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.944
These are the people
that you're in bed with.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.846
These are the people
that you're spying for.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.214
- No.
- Yes.

18:36.282 --> 18:40.485
Killing a CIA station chief,
that's a big deal, Dennis.

18:40.552 --> 18:41.987
It's a very big deal.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.990
Nobody, not even the ISI,
would do such a thing lightly.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.391
It means they are protecting
another agenda.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.894
It means, almost certainly,
American lives are at stake,

18:50.962 --> 18:53.563
either here or in Afghanistan
or back at home.

18:53.631 --> 18:54.965
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

18:55.033 --> 18:56.566
- I'm not stupid.
- Then start

18:56.634 --> 18:58.168
fucking talking!

18:58.236 --> 19:00.070
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

19:00.138 --> 19:03.306
You passed state
secrets to Sandy,

19:03.374 --> 19:04.874
you broke into my apartment,

19:04.941 --> 19:07.477
you dosed me
with a powerful hallucinogen--

19:07.544 --> 19:08.878
what else have
you been asked to do?

19:08.945 --> 19:11.014
Nothing.

19:13.783 --> 19:15.485
(sighs)

19:15.552 --> 19:19.122
You say that you understand,
but I don't think that you do.

19:19.189 --> 19:22.090
This is a matter of
national security, Dennis.

19:22.158 --> 19:25.293
You have no idea how much
discretion that gives me.

19:25.361 --> 19:28.196
- Wh-What do you mean?
- I can call in

19:28.264 --> 19:30.032
a professional interrogator.
I can have you rendered

19:30.099 --> 19:31.633
- to a black site.
- No, you can't.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.268
We don't do that anymore.
That policy

19:33.336 --> 19:34.936
- was repudiated.
- Publicly it was.

19:35.004 --> 19:36.438
- You're bluffing.
- I am authorized

19:36.506 --> 19:38.939
to kill US citizens on the
battlefield, you motherfucker.

19:39.007 --> 19:40.007
Don't think I can't do

19:40.075 --> 19:41.442
whatever is required.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.044
Don't think that I won't.

19:43.912 --> 19:46.647
Go to hell.

19:47.749 --> 19:49.683
You know what, Dennis...

19:49.751 --> 19:51.519
(scoffs)

19:51.586 --> 19:54.454
...you just fucked yourself.

19:54.522 --> 19:56.022
Wait, wait, wh-what
are you doing?

19:56.090 --> 19:57.623
What are you doing?

19:57.691 --> 19:59.959
MARTHA: This is my goddamn embassy.
Open the door!

20:00.027 --> 20:02.495
GARY: Ma-Ma'am, sorry.
Ma'am. Ma'am.

20:02.563 --> 20:04.330
- Why is he in here?
CARRIE: - I'm questioning him.

20:04.398 --> 20:05.898
- You're what?
- I believe he's involved--

20:05.966 --> 20:07.367
You have no fucking right

20:07.435 --> 20:10.136
to question anyone-- anyone!--
in my embassy

20:10.204 --> 20:11.903
without my say-so.

20:11.971 --> 20:13.905
Dennis, come with me.

20:14.974 --> 20:17.842
You are finished here.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.511
Do you understand?

20:19.579 --> 20:22.314
You are finished everywhere.

20:38.663 --> 20:40.864
She accused me of
spying for the ISI.

20:40.932 --> 20:42.266
What?!

20:42.334 --> 20:46.103
Apparently I'm in league with
the people that killed Sandy.

20:46.170 --> 20:48.037
- <i>You</i> are?
- I am.

20:48.106 --> 20:50.340
Did she produce any
evidence to support this?

20:50.408 --> 20:53.343
Just threats and accusations.

20:53.411 --> 20:54.744
You sure? Nothing specific?

20:54.812 --> 20:55.745
Nothing.

20:55.813 --> 20:57.214
Why do you ask?

20:57.281 --> 21:00.783
Because it's unlikely they would
have invented something

21:00.851 --> 21:02.151
out of thin air.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.853
You must've had contact
with someone they suspect.

21:04.921 --> 21:06.722
Any idea who that could be?

21:06.789 --> 21:08.090
No. Not offhand.

21:08.158 --> 21:10.025
What about at the university?

21:10.093 --> 21:12.294
One of your new students?
A fellow professor?

21:12.362 --> 21:13.962
- Honestly, nobody.
- Come on, Dennis,

21:14.030 --> 21:16.031
there must be somebody--
think.

21:18.135 --> 21:20.101
You can tell me.

21:23.071 --> 21:25.540
Even if you're having
an affair, you can tell me.

21:25.608 --> 21:28.009
- I'm not having an affair! Jesus!
- Okay. Okay.

21:28.076 --> 21:30.011
I'm just trying to help.

21:31.547 --> 21:34.048
Listen, I got to deal
with this Saul business.

21:34.116 --> 21:35.650
Go. Go.
I'll be fine.

21:35.717 --> 21:37.484
Stay here.
Don't talk to anyone.

21:37.552 --> 21:39.553
And if Mathison
tries anything again...

21:39.621 --> 21:40.854
I'll call you.

21:40.921 --> 21:42.889
Do that.

22:12.151 --> 22:14.085
He denies everything.

22:14.153 --> 22:15.654
Fuck.

22:15.721 --> 22:17.055
What did he say?

22:17.122 --> 22:19.057
Nada. Zip.

22:19.124 --> 22:21.293
It's like he knew
I was playing him.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.062
Got to admit, part of me was
impressed he didn't fall for it.

22:24.129 --> 22:26.731
It's a hell of a time for
him to discover a backbone.

22:26.799 --> 22:27.898
Isn't it?

22:27.965 --> 22:29.900
I'll keep trying.

22:32.370 --> 22:34.871
Excuse me. Briefing for the
exchange starts in 40 minutes.

22:34.939 --> 22:36.473
Vehicles on standby.
We got to go.

22:36.541 --> 22:38.409
Bring Saul home.

22:44.881 --> 22:46.549
Nothing out of Dennis?

22:46.617 --> 22:48.084
Well, let's just concentrate
on getting Saul back...

22:48.151 --> 22:49.686
- I want you to stay here.
- No.

22:49.753 --> 22:51.087
- Quinn...
- No, I need to be at the exchange.

22:51.154 --> 22:52.422
I'll have Special Forces,

22:52.489 --> 22:54.190
two security details,
I'll be fine.

22:54.258 --> 22:56.259
I called in a Global Hawk
from Bagram.

22:56.327 --> 22:58.261
It'll be at 45,000 feet
in overwatch,

22:58.329 --> 23:00.363
but I need you in the ops room
monitoring it.

23:00.431 --> 23:02.364
- What am I looking for?
- (sighs)

23:02.432 --> 23:03.932
Anything the ISI
or Haqqani might try.

23:03.999 --> 23:06.034
Maybe getting their guys
back and keeping Saul.

23:06.102 --> 23:07.202
Maybe even killing Saul.

23:07.270 --> 23:09.271
- You think that's likely?
- Don't know.

23:09.339 --> 23:11.607
But I know there's
something else going on.

23:11.674 --> 23:13.609
I'll keep my eyes open.

23:23.785 --> 23:26.454
(boy speaking Urdu)

23:26.521 --> 23:29.410
Tea.
Very good.

23:34.363 --> 23:36.296
(grunts)

23:49.310 --> 23:51.244
(sighs)

24:16.702 --> 24:18.303
Sir...

24:18.370 --> 24:19.604
Mr. Boyd,
you need to stop.

24:19.672 --> 24:21.939
(car alarm chirps)

24:22.007 --> 24:24.809
I'm sorry.
You can't leave the house.

24:24.876 --> 24:25.976
What do you mean, I can't?

24:26.044 --> 24:28.011
For your own safety, sir.

24:28.078 --> 24:30.447
I've got to get to my office.
I've got to pick up some papers.

24:30.515 --> 24:31.815
I'll be 20 minutes.

24:31.882 --> 24:33.216
- I can't let you do that.
- (sighs)

24:33.284 --> 24:34.551
Well, then come with me, man.

24:34.619 --> 24:36.486
I need these papers,
I've got work to do,

24:36.554 --> 24:38.822
I-I just can't sit around
this house all day...

24:44.928 --> 24:46.495
MARTHA:
Thank you, Sergeant.

24:46.563 --> 24:48.331
What is this?

24:48.398 --> 24:50.733
- I can't even go to my office?
- Why do you need to go there?

24:50.801 --> 24:53.001
Why do you think?
I have essays to mark.

24:53.069 --> 24:54.136
I don't believe you.

24:58.208 --> 24:59.742
What's in the bag?

24:59.810 --> 25:01.543
Nothing. Papers.

25:01.610 --> 25:02.877
Show me.

25:02.945 --> 25:04.245
Don't be ridiculous.

25:04.313 --> 25:05.380
- Sergeant...
- Ma'am?

25:05.448 --> 25:07.081
Give me Mr. Boyd's bag.

25:07.149 --> 25:09.016
Are you kidding me?
Come on, just...

25:09.084 --> 25:10.885
Come...

25:14.923 --> 25:18.091
(scoffs) Clothes,
passport, money...

25:18.159 --> 25:19.860
Really.

25:19.927 --> 25:21.194
Tell me what
you're involved in,

25:21.262 --> 25:22.763
or I will have you locked up.

25:22.831 --> 25:25.466
I'm involved in nothing,
I've done nothing.

25:25.533 --> 25:27.501
Dennis...

25:27.569 --> 25:29.603
please stop lying.

25:29.671 --> 25:31.605
I'm not lying.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.208
Take Mr. Boyd
to the guardroom.

25:36.276 --> 25:37.777
Hold him there.

25:37.845 --> 25:41.046
No phone calls, no visitors,
no communication with anyone.

25:41.114 --> 25:42.882
- Martha, Martha, don't do this.
- Let's go, sir.

25:42.949 --> 25:44.340
Don't do this, Martha!

25:51.891 --> 25:53.825
(indistinct conversations)

26:00.966 --> 26:02.734
Ms. Mathison.

26:02.802 --> 26:04.302
Good morning, General.

26:04.370 --> 26:07.238
My deputy, John Redmond.
Captain Franzen,

26:07.306 --> 26:09.239
who's in charge
of the prisoner escort.

26:09.307 --> 26:11.375
Director Lockhart
isn't with you?

26:11.443 --> 26:13.010
Why should he be?

26:13.077 --> 26:15.312
Is he not interested in the
safe return of Mr. Berenson?

26:15.380 --> 26:17.848
Mr. Berenson was taken
from an area controlled

26:17.916 --> 26:19.283
by the ISI, just like this.

26:19.350 --> 26:20.918
Is that why you brought
your private army?

26:20.985 --> 26:22.520
Shall we get on with it?

26:22.587 --> 26:25.955
Excuse me.
This is where we are.

26:26.023 --> 26:28.257
And here--
this area of tarmac--

26:28.325 --> 26:29.959
is where the exchange
will happen.

26:30.027 --> 26:32.595
And as you requested,
it has clear lines of sight

26:32.663 --> 26:35.298
and is not overlooked
by any building.

26:35.365 --> 26:37.600
- Where will your side be?
- This hangar will be

26:37.668 --> 26:41.037
our staging point; we will be
in clear view outside of it.

26:41.104 --> 26:42.704
The CIA position is here.

26:42.772 --> 26:45.273
How will Mr. Berenson be
delivered to the exchange?

26:45.341 --> 26:46.608
When we see the Taliban

26:46.676 --> 26:48.677
prisoners and have
confirmed their identities,

26:48.745 --> 26:50.646
we will contact
Haqqani's representatives.

26:50.713 --> 26:51.947
They will then
deliver Mr. Berenson

26:52.014 --> 26:53.449
to the point of exchange.

26:53.516 --> 26:55.050
What assurance do we
have that Haqqani won't

26:55.117 --> 26:58.554
attempt to overrun the site
once the prisoners arrive?

26:58.621 --> 26:59.687
The Pakistani army

26:59.755 --> 27:02.122
controls this site,
not Mr. Haqqani.

27:02.190 --> 27:04.859
- It's Lockhart.
- Mm-hmm.

27:04.927 --> 27:08.128
Sir?

27:08.196 --> 27:10.397
REDMOND: What about
the exchange itself?

27:10.466 --> 27:12.900
TASNEEM: Haqqani's men
will leave Mr. Berenson here

27:12.968 --> 27:15.770
in plain sight, then withdraw.
You will release

27:15.838 --> 27:17.838
the prisoners, who will walk to
the same point, unaccompanied.

27:17.905 --> 27:19.473
What is it?

27:19.540 --> 27:20.841
This doesn't feel right.

27:20.908 --> 27:22.342
Once they are parallel
with Mr. Berenson...

27:22.409 --> 27:24.478
- What do you mean?
- ...each party will go to their own side.

27:24.545 --> 27:25.979
We're really exposed out here.

27:26.046 --> 27:28.949
I heard the location met all the
specifications your side gave.

27:29.016 --> 27:30.283
You <i>heard?</i>

27:30.351 --> 27:33.786
You mean you didn't know?

27:33.854 --> 27:35.988
I was shut out of the planning.

27:36.055 --> 27:39.992
- Is that unusual?
- You could say so.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.027
- Aasar, is there something going on?
BUNNY: - And may I remind you--

27:42.095 --> 27:43.929
- your ambassador agreed on your behalf...
- Some kind of double-cross?

27:43.997 --> 27:46.431
...no drone or UAV will
overfly the exchange.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.601
For God's sake, tell me.

27:48.603 --> 27:50.335
BUNNY: If we see one
or hear one,

27:50.403 --> 27:52.436
or hear <i>of</i> one,
Mr. Berenson will

27:52.505 --> 27:54.706
- not be returned.
REDMOND: - And neither

27:54.773 --> 27:56.374
will the prisoners.

27:56.441 --> 27:57.842
But assuming a
successful handover,

27:57.910 --> 27:59.477
may I remind you
of your agreement

27:59.545 --> 28:02.313
- that the prisoners, once exchanged...
- Mm-hmm.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.882
...will remain within
Pakistani military custody.

28:03.949 --> 28:06.885
This was the preeminent
condition of the White House

28:06.952 --> 28:08.819
- and Director Lockhart and agreed to.
- Yeah.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.787
- Okay, will do.
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.223
Of course. We do not want to see
these people on the street

28:13.290 --> 28:14.958
any more than you do.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.894
Is there anything else,
Mr. Redmond?

28:16.961 --> 28:18.896
If there is, we all have
radios, the frequencies

28:18.963 --> 28:20.497
are set and secure.

28:20.565 --> 28:21.732
Let's get on with it.

28:21.799 --> 28:24.501
I agree.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.504
(Saul grunting, panting)

28:35.378 --> 28:37.312
- (speaks Urdu)
- (grunts)

28:55.698 --> 28:57.799
No.

28:57.867 --> 29:00.601
Fucking no.

29:00.669 --> 29:02.135
Why don't you put it on?

29:02.203 --> 29:03.671
Why don't you,
you fucking coward?

29:03.739 --> 29:07.174
He is happy to wear it,
Mr. Berenson, because...

29:07.242 --> 29:10.811
one year ago, when you were
director of the CIA,

29:10.879 --> 29:13.814
a drone killed
his father and brother.

29:16.350 --> 29:17.784
He is happy to wear it.

29:30.765 --> 29:32.698
(low, indistinct communication)

29:36.870 --> 29:38.136
MAN:
Peter...

29:38.204 --> 29:40.138
prisoners are on approach.

29:40.206 --> 29:41.573
Show's about to begin.

29:41.641 --> 29:44.209
Here we go.

29:44.277 --> 29:46.211
(low, indistinct
radio communication)

30:08.332 --> 30:09.833
(indistinct radio
communication)

30:13.404 --> 30:15.138
Bring them out.

30:18.476 --> 30:20.410
Quinn, do you see anything?

30:23.314 --> 30:24.680
No, you're all clear.

30:37.661 --> 30:38.828
Your prisoners are here.

30:46.869 --> 30:48.269
We see them.

30:49.394 --> 30:51.047
Now we want to see Saul.

30:52.174 --> 30:53.842
(indistinct radio communication)

30:53.909 --> 30:55.677
(speaks Urdu)

30:59.681 --> 31:02.148
(indistinct radio
communication)

31:34.814 --> 31:36.347
Quinn?

31:36.415 --> 31:38.383
Perimeter's still clear.

31:40.820 --> 31:42.508
What are they waiting for?

32:00.939 --> 32:02.840
(grunts, speaks Urdu)

32:07.745 --> 32:09.946
- (man shouts)
- (grunting)

32:17.220 --> 32:19.556
- (panting)
- (speaks Urdu)

32:32.569 --> 32:33.501
You see Saul Berenson.

32:33.570 --> 32:34.603
Let the prisoners go.

32:36.706 --> 32:38.574
CARRIE: Not until
those men pull back.

32:38.641 --> 32:39.807
They get in the van
and drive away

32:39.875 --> 32:40.942
or the prisoners
stay right here.

32:49.051 --> 32:51.518
(panting)

33:02.863 --> 33:04.030
REDMOND:
Who the fuck is that?

33:04.098 --> 33:06.165
They left a kid behind.

33:06.233 --> 33:08.635
What's the boy doing there?

33:08.703 --> 33:09.970
I don't know.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.807
He has to leave too.

33:23.016 --> 33:24.650
- Bomb vest.
- Jesus.

33:24.718 --> 33:26.251
- Watch the prisoners.
FRANZEN: - Get 'em on

33:26.319 --> 33:28.487
- the ground!
- (speaking Urdu)

33:28.554 --> 33:30.755
What the fuck is this--
a suicide vest?

33:30.823 --> 33:34.458
We didn't know. Obviously,
Haqqani doesn't trust you.

33:34.526 --> 33:36.060
You tell Haqqani anything
happens to Saul,

33:36.128 --> 33:37.795
we execute the prisoners,
right here,

33:37.863 --> 33:40.131
right now--
tell him.

33:42.701 --> 33:44.335
(indistinct radio
communication)

33:44.402 --> 33:45.670
Who's got the detonator?

33:45.738 --> 33:47.771
Quinn-- kid with the
bomb vest next to Saul.

33:47.839 --> 33:49.973
Find the detonator.

33:50.041 --> 33:53.076
Could be anywhere.
Everyone has a damn cell phone.

33:57.715 --> 33:59.182
The boy is insurance.

33:59.250 --> 34:01.818
As soon as the prisoners are
free he will leave with them.

34:01.886 --> 34:04.587
What guarantees do we have?

34:04.955 --> 34:06.922
Haqqani will not
kill his own men,

34:06.990 --> 34:08.090
that is your guarantee.

34:08.158 --> 34:10.125
But you need to do this now.
Now!

34:20.971 --> 34:22.536
Okay.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.174
Walk the prisoners.

34:26.241 --> 34:28.009
(soldier speaking Urdu)

34:30.478 --> 34:32.847
(breathing anxiously)

34:33.614 --> 34:35.016
(soldier speaks Urdu)

34:37.319 --> 34:41.754
(low, indistinct radio
communication)

35:06.146 --> 35:08.947
- Saul, don't.
- What's he doing?

35:09.016 --> 35:10.749
- Stop the prisoners.
- Stop the prisoners!

35:10.817 --> 35:12.151
Halt.

35:12.219 --> 35:14.386
What the hell
is Berenson doing?

35:14.453 --> 35:15.887
Come on.
(speaking Urdu)

35:15.954 --> 35:18.056
Maybe he doesn't trust the boy.

35:19.458 --> 35:21.592
The boy's not the problem,
Berenson is.

35:23.062 --> 35:24.195
Berenson!

35:25.898 --> 35:27.765
You stand up!

35:27.833 --> 35:29.600
You stand up!
I will do it!

35:29.668 --> 35:31.035
Go on, then!

35:31.102 --> 35:34.038
Do it!
Fucking do it!

35:34.105 --> 35:35.906
I'll send my men,
they'll get him to his feet.

35:35.973 --> 35:39.209
No-- you send soldiers,
Haqqani will blow the bomb.

35:39.277 --> 35:40.844
I'll do it!

35:40.912 --> 35:43.880
You stand up, Berenson!

35:43.948 --> 35:46.050
I will do it!
I will blow us all away!

35:46.117 --> 35:47.950
SAUL:
Blow 'em to fucking hell!

35:48.018 --> 35:49.452
Blow 'em to goddamn
fucking hell!

35:49.520 --> 35:51.087
- Berenson!
- Please, God!

35:51.155 --> 35:53.022
Please, God, blow 'em to hell.

35:53.090 --> 35:55.058
I'll go.

35:55.125 --> 35:57.260
Blow 'em to fucking hell.

35:57.327 --> 35:58.894
Okay. Just you.

35:58.962 --> 36:00.430
- You stand up, Berenson!
- (boy speaking quietly)

36:00.497 --> 36:02.065
(muttering)

36:02.132 --> 36:04.132
I will do it!

36:04.200 --> 36:06.034
I will blow us all away!

36:06.102 --> 36:08.036
You stand up now!

36:09.638 --> 36:11.606
What is she doing?

36:11.674 --> 36:14.543
She's trying
to keep this thing alive.

36:27.255 --> 36:30.091
Saul? Saul, it's me.

36:31.726 --> 36:32.659
(Carrie turns off radio)

36:32.727 --> 36:34.995
Saul, you gotta move.

36:35.063 --> 36:36.997
Hey...

36:37.065 --> 36:39.932
you need to move.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.702
- I want you to come with me.
- No.

36:42.769 --> 36:45.004
- Saul...
- What?

36:45.072 --> 36:47.006
I promised Mira I was
bringing you home.

36:47.074 --> 36:48.908
You think I want to go home?

36:48.976 --> 36:51.911
You said this wouldn't happen,
you promised me no exchange.

36:51.979 --> 36:55.714
- I couldn't let you die.
- It wasn't up to you, it wasn't your call.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.516
You think I can live with this?

36:57.584 --> 36:59.218
I can't even look at it.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.453
Saul, listen to me...

37:01.521 --> 37:03.455
No, you listen.

37:04.524 --> 37:06.258
Do not give them
those prisoners.

37:06.326 --> 37:08.260
Do not give them one prisoner.

37:08.328 --> 37:09.861
Just go.

37:09.929 --> 37:11.196
- Go.
- I'm not leaving without you.

37:11.264 --> 37:14.298
Then we both die here.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.568
Both?

37:17.636 --> 37:19.737
What about the boy?

37:19.804 --> 37:21.539
What about him?

37:21.607 --> 37:24.408
He said his prayers, he thinks
he's going to fuckin' Heaven.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.812
He's a child.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.015
They put the vest
on him, not us.

37:32.082 --> 37:34.251
So that makes it okay?

37:37.988 --> 37:40.223
Do you know who you sound like?

37:40.291 --> 37:42.225
Them.

37:43.894 --> 37:46.728
14 years of war, and
this is what it's come to?

37:46.796 --> 37:49.165
Asking a child to blow
you to kingdom come?

37:49.232 --> 37:51.167
And for what?

37:52.902 --> 37:54.836
(voice breaking):
For fucking what?!

38:04.146 --> 38:06.281
This is not who we are.

38:07.849 --> 38:10.185
This is not who you are.

38:16.458 --> 38:19.394
Please. Please.

38:21.095 --> 38:22.862
(crying):
Please, Saul.

38:24.699 --> 38:26.966
Just get up, get up.

38:27.034 --> 38:28.968
Goddamn it.

38:29.036 --> 38:32.306
(crying):
Goddamn it, get up. Get up.

38:32.373 --> 38:34.408
Please.

38:34.475 --> 38:36.510
(sighs)

38:41.114 --> 38:43.048
No more dying.

38:46.587 --> 38:48.521
(wind whistling)

38:55.595 --> 38:57.662
I want to go home.

39:00.499 --> 39:02.434
Come on.

39:02.501 --> 39:04.436
(groans soft)

39:08.274 --> 39:10.342
(sighs)

39:10.409 --> 39:11.908
John?

39:11.976 --> 39:14.511
With you.

39:14.579 --> 39:17.514
We're ready.

39:17.582 --> 39:19.550
Send the prisoners.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.518
(man shouts in Urdu)

39:24.422 --> 39:26.624
(panting)

39:26.691 --> 39:28.625
(low, indistinct radio
communication)

39:39.069 --> 39:40.903
(crying quietly)

39:45.775 --> 39:47.709
(panting)

39:50.580 --> 39:53.005
(low, indistinct
radio communication)

40:15.437 --> 40:17.371
(indistinct radio communication)

40:28.081 --> 40:30.016
(indistinct radio communication)

40:56.141 --> 40:58.075
(man speaking Urdu)

41:02.180 --> 41:04.114
(speaking Urdu)

41:28.505 --> 41:30.439
I'll be outside, ma'am.

41:30.507 --> 41:32.441
Thank you.

41:33.777 --> 41:34.810
(door closes, lock buzzes)

41:34.878 --> 41:35.811
(Martha sighs)

41:42.018 --> 41:45.086
The prisoner exchange worked.

41:45.153 --> 41:47.088
A few hairy moments,

41:47.155 --> 41:52.093
but Saul Berenson is now
on his way back to the embassy.

41:52.160 --> 41:54.095
- (sighs)
- That's good.

42:01.136 --> 42:03.069
How did we end up here?

42:11.078 --> 42:13.013
Martha, listen to me.

42:13.080 --> 42:19.285
Yes?

42:19.352 --> 42:22.588
You know this is all
the fault of the CIA.

42:22.656 --> 42:25.625
Ever since that wedding was
bombed, it's been the CIA.

42:25.692 --> 42:27.894
- Don't...
- They are responsible.

42:27.961 --> 42:29.962
They have no
evidence against me.

42:30.030 --> 42:31.564
They're making all
this stuff up.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.566
Stop.

43:10.801 --> 43:12.969
(phone ringing)

43:15.238 --> 43:17.006
Yeah?

43:17.074 --> 43:19.008
Okay. Hang on.

43:19.076 --> 43:20.944
It's Mira.

43:28.985 --> 43:30.919
(sighs)

43:41.965 --> 43:44.131
(sighs)

43:44.199 --> 43:46.133
It's me.

43:46.201 --> 43:49.103
(explosion thunders)

44:02.783 --> 44:06.052
MAN: What's up?
We got something going on.

44:06.120 --> 44:07.988
- (indistinct radio communication)
- What was that?

44:08.055 --> 44:09.322
Sounded like RPGs.

44:09.390 --> 44:11.992
LOCKHART:
Get Quinn

44:12.059 --> 44:13.793
and contact Carrie Mathison.

44:13.861 --> 44:16.329
Sir, over here.

44:16.397 --> 44:17.330
Embassy security cameras.

44:17.398 --> 44:18.497
- Where is that?
- I-9.

44:18.565 --> 44:20.866
On the route Mr. Berenson's
convoy's taking.

44:20.934 --> 44:22.868
Sir, there's no
answer from Carrie.

44:22.936 --> 44:25.538
Comms are down.
Convoy must have been hit.

44:25.605 --> 44:27.540
What the fuck?!

44:27.607 --> 44:29.675
What the fucking fuck?!

44:32.979 --> 44:34.913
How far is that?

44:34.980 --> 44:36.915
About four blocks.

44:36.982 --> 44:38.917
Deploy the Marines.

44:38.984 --> 44:41.920
Get 'em out of the embassy and
to the blast site right away.

44:50.529 --> 44:52.462
Go!

44:53.631 --> 44:55.566
(engines revving)

45:04.208 --> 45:05.141
Sergeant!

45:05.209 --> 45:06.209
(banging on door)

45:06.277 --> 45:07.945
What's happening?

45:08.012 --> 45:09.712
Mr. Berenson's
convoy's been hit.

45:09.780 --> 45:10.947
Oh, my God.

45:11.014 --> 45:12.582
The Marines have
left the embassy.

45:12.649 --> 45:14.249
- Mr. Lockhart's orders.
MARTHA: - Where is Lockhart?

45:14.317 --> 45:17.352
- CIA ops room, ma'am.
- Martha, what's going on?

45:17.420 --> 45:18.721
- Some kind of ambush.
- Where?

45:18.789 --> 45:20.923
- Out on the streets. I have to go.
- Wait.

45:20.991 --> 45:23.158
- Where have the Marines gone?
- To give assistance.

45:23.226 --> 45:24.259
All of them?

45:26.161 --> 45:27.095
Why not?

45:28.664 --> 45:30.999
Dennis, why not?

45:31.067 --> 45:33.702
That's what she wanted to know.

45:33.769 --> 45:35.336
Who?

45:35.404 --> 45:37.338
Tasneem.

45:37.406 --> 45:39.340
Tasneem is your contact?

45:39.408 --> 45:41.610
What did she want
to know? Tell me.

45:41.677 --> 45:43.944
How Carrie Mathison got
in and out of the embassy.

45:44.012 --> 45:46.013
What did you tell her?

45:46.081 --> 45:48.048
About the tunnel
under the embassy.
