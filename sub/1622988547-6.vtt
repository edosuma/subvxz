WEBVTT

00:04.546 --> 00:06.715
("My Guess Is as Good as Yours"
by Earthy Babes playing)

00:09.634 --> 00:13.054
This is awful.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.932
Weston's article about
me being a dictator

00:16.015 --> 00:18.768
has been picked up by a bunch
of outlets; it's everywhere.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.395
Okay, I don't think
it's<i> everywhere.</i>

00:20.478 --> 00:24.107
Yeah. My name is trending number
four in the U.S. right now.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.110
Well, in the clickbait Olympics,
you don't even make the podium.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.696
And the worst part is,
now my inbox

00:29.779 --> 00:31.614
is full of interview requests
from other places.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.533
I woke up to 27 voice mails.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.201
What you should do is
hold a press conference.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.079
No, no, I've had enough
press in my life for one month.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.165
I don't know why you keep
looking at that stuff.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.666
It doesn't matter

00:41.750 --> 00:42.834
what a bunch of online
trolls are saying.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.044
The people of Greylock,
they love you.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.089
Her Excellency!
Supreme Leader.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.632
Guiding Sunbeam.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.594
Guiding Sun Ray, Max.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.888
Kim Jong-il was called
the Guiding Sun Ray.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.516
But he has a point.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.268
Max?
No, Weston.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.979
Nothing he said
in his article was wrong.

01:03.062 --> 01:04.397
I haven't had any oversight

01:04.481 --> 01:06.441
since I became
Greylock's leader.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.526
I always meant for there
to be checks and balances.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.528
This was always, like,
was always gonna be

01:10.612 --> 01:12.489
a democracy, I just
haven't had time

01:12.572 --> 01:14.783
to democratize.

♪ My guess... ♪

01:17.160 --> 01:17.577

What?

01:33.092 --> 01:34.886
Knock it off.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.638
People are gonna think you're
trying to swipe her firstborn.

01:36.721 --> 01:37.847
I can't help it.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.808
Every time I see a baby,
I just think about...

01:39.891 --> 01:41.059
Your preggers paramour?

01:41.142 --> 01:43.478
I wasn't gonna
say it like that.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.146
Oh, what about virile vixen?
Boo eating for two?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.690
I'm gonna dump this
coffee on your head.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.692
AJ, you don't even know
if Alexis is pregnant.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.694
Come on, the positive test
that you found

01:51.778 --> 01:52.904
could totally be Bella's.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.031
Bella's been at prep school
for three weeks.

01:55.114 --> 01:56.324
And the test was bought
with Alexis's credit card.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.034
I saw the receipt.
Okay.

01:58.117 --> 01:59.369
So maybe the pregnancy's
an accident.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.539
Or maybe she's trying to eat
her cake and have it, too.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.624
She keeps this from me,
she can enjoy our little soirees

02:04.707 --> 02:06.167
for another month or two

02:06.251 --> 02:07.710
before she trades in
her heels for high chairs.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.129
Ooh, maybe you would know

02:10.213 --> 02:12.257
if you, I don't
know, uh, asked her.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.175
Well, I'm afraid to.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.010
If I ask her and she says
what I think she'll say...

02:16.094 --> 02:18.429
You know how my temper is.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.723
Okay, so talk to Alexis
at the station.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.600
Look, if you do it at work,
you'll have cover

02:22.684 --> 02:24.561
and you won't lose it.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.561
She's been gone.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.729
Probably morning sickness.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.189
Okay, AJ, just talk to her.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.110
SARAH:
<i>We need to talk.</i>

02:32.193 --> 02:33.903
<i>As I'm sure you all know</i>

02:33.987 --> 02:36.739
by now, the media has determined

02:36.823 --> 02:41.661
my leadership of Greylock
to be a little... absolute.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.038
And while I wish I could
tell Weston Woods

02:44.122 --> 02:45.915
to go suck a tailpipe,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.001
the truth is, he's right.

02:48.084 --> 02:52.297
We have an opportunity
to build something great here,

02:52.380 --> 02:55.508
something that represents
all of us.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.719
And in order to do that,
we need more voices

02:57.802 --> 02:59.596
in the room than just mine.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.098
So, over the course
of the next week

03:02.181 --> 03:04.809
we will be holding elections
for a new congress.

03:04.893 --> 03:05.852
The rules for these elections
are derived from

03:05.935 --> 03:07.145
the Greylock town charter.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.606
There will be two rounds
of voting.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.274
The primary is open.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.110
Every adult resident of Greylock
is eligible to vote

03:14.193 --> 03:16.029
and to run for office.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.739
The six highest vote getters
will enter a runoff

03:17.822 --> 03:19.616
for four seats.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.367
These roles are part-time

03:21.451 --> 03:23.161
and on a volunteer basis.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.121
You can keep your day job.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.165
All I ask is your time

03:27.248 --> 03:29.959
and your mind to help me write

03:30.043 --> 03:32.045
a new constitution for Greylock.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.006
This is a democracy,
not a dictatorship,

03:35.089 --> 03:37.717
and together
we're going to prove it.

Finally decided to let
the people of Greylock

03:51.898 --> 03:53.733
have a say, huh?

03:53.816 --> 03:54.859
I'm sorry if you don't like
the way I've handled things.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.527
All I can do is try my best.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.237
Six months ago you were
a high school teacher.

What qualifies you

04:00.531 --> 04:01.824
without any supervision?

04:01.908 --> 04:04.327
Supervision?

04:04.410 --> 04:07.789
I need checks and balances,
not a babysitter.

You just can't get
enough of us, can you?

04:13.628 --> 04:16.839

I figured you'd be off

04:16.923 --> 04:18.508
to fry bigger fish.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.176
Well, my editor wants me
to stay to write a follow-up.

04:20.259 --> 04:22.762
My first article about you
got a lot of traction.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.555
Yeah, I noticed.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.555
Yeah, sorry about that.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.100
Yeah, don't be. It was,
um... it was fair.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.601
Harsh but fair.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.019
Still hoping I suck a tailpipe?

04:30.103 --> 04:30.979
Sorry about that.
Don't be.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.773
It was fair.
Harsh but... but fair.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.901
You know, you could
have folks email you

04:36.985 --> 04:38.569
their candidate paperwork.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.530
Yeah, our town charter requires
citizens to register in person.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.658
Your town charter also says
it's against the law

04:43.741 --> 04:45.576
for a common animal
to have carnal knowledge

04:45.660 --> 04:47.286
of a pet from a noble household.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.997
Yeah. And these elections are
the last time it will have

04:49.080 --> 04:50.915
any authority in Greylock.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.458
After the vote, the new
legislators and I will

04:52.542 --> 04:55.545
write a constitution
that will form the backbone

04:55.628 --> 04:56.462
of this country.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.923
Seems pretty undictatorial
to me.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.633
Unless, of course,
you're running the election.

05:00.717 --> 05:01.467
No. Keeping my hands
off of this one.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.220
Officer Vince is all over it.

05:04.303 --> 05:05.847
Well, I'm no expert
on election science,

05:05.930 --> 05:07.974
but, uh, it all seems
on the up and up to me.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.184
Good. Not that I'm trying
to impress you or anything.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.060
No, of course not.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.187
No.
Okay.

Maya Jiménez. That's J-I...

05:16.649 --> 05:18.443
What do you think
you're doing?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.529
Becoming a public servant?

05:21.612 --> 05:24.574
You're a child.
You can't run for office.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.576
Well, if I count as an adult
when you're trying to deport me,

05:26.659 --> 05:28.995
then I sure as hell
count as an adult now.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.580
What would somebody your age
know about governing?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.248
Well, I know we shouldn't
be trying

05:32.331 --> 05:34.417
to deport our own citizens
over a prank gone wrong.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.960
You broke the law.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.670
Hey, it was a dumb law
made by dumb adults.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.088
If that's "mature" leadership,
maybe it's time

05:39.172 --> 05:40.757
we get a little immature.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.924
Excuse me?

05:40.840 --> 05:41.924
Save it for the campaign,
ladies.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.801
Ms. Jiménez is correct.

05:43.885 --> 05:48.431
According to the town charter,
she qualifies as an adult

05:48.514 --> 05:50.266
and is old enough
to run for office.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.059
(chuckles)

05:51.142 --> 05:52.852
Hey, good luck.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.395
Thank you.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.899
See you.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.902
You know, I ran into William
earlier today,

06:00.985 --> 06:03.071
and he told me he wasn't
entering the election because

06:03.154 --> 06:05.448
he wanted to spend
more time with his family.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.824
(scoffs)

06:06.908 --> 06:08.159
More like more time
with his new baby.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.995
You know, at least now I know.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.706
And I took your advice
and called Alexis.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.126
So now this explains why
I didn't get a call back.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.045
Easy there,<i> American Psycho.</i>

06:19.128 --> 06:19.796
Your girlfriend did you wrong,
not my muffin.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.714
I'm sorry.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.132
I don't even want
to talk about it anymore.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.094
(sighs):
Okay.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.762
Great. Let's talk
about something else.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.681
Are you gonna still run
for the new congress thing?

06:30.765 --> 06:34.477
Oh, yeah. I turned in
my paperwork this afternoon.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.437
Oh! And what is your platform?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.606
I'm assuming that it involves
asking Childish Gambino

06:38.689 --> 06:40.149
to write
the new national anthem.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.236
Uh, right after Kara Walker
redesigns the flag.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.236
(laughs)

06:43.319 --> 06:44.487
I mean, Greylock is stuck
between a superpower

06:44.570 --> 06:47.657
and its closest allies.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.657
Mm-hmm.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.575
At some point, we're
gonna have to start thinking
about national security.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.660
And diplomacy.
I figure we need

06:50.743 --> 06:53.162
someone who knows
how to handle both

06:53.246 --> 06:54.747
without being a D-bag.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.498
What about you?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.291
Me?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.291
You gonna run?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.168
You're always talking
about something

06:59.252 --> 07:01.295
"somebody" should do
to make Greylock better.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.047
Why can't that
somebody be you?

07:03.131 --> 07:05.800
Well, because I'm not...

07:06.592 --> 07:07.927
I can't...

07:06.592 --> 07:07.927
You are.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.470
And you can.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.516
Come on, you should run.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.519
Having you on that council is
exactly what this country needs.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.440
Whoa, you know
you're burning those,

07:21.524 --> 07:24.318
right?

07:21.524 --> 07:24.318
Yeah, just how Doris likes them.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.070
Her cat's been puking like
a freshman on prom night.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.322
I'm, uh,
just trying to cheer her up.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.907
What about you?
I heard

07:29.991 --> 07:32.201
that near-deportation thing
was pretty rough.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.995
Sorry I wasn't here to help.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.288
What were you gonna do?
It's not like anyone

07:35.371 --> 07:37.331
could stop Chairman Cooper
once she got going.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.958
She wasn't really trying
to screw you over, right?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.543
Yeah, well, she did anyway.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.628
Which is why I'm
running for a spot

07:42.712 --> 07:44.213
on the new congress.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.215
That's allowed?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.009
I'm on the prelim ballot.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.552
Hey, actually, which reminds me,
I have a favor to ask.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.263
What, you want me
to suppress a few votes,

07:52.346 --> 07:54.015
pass out some election flyers
with the wrong date on them?

07:54.098 --> 07:56.893
(laughs)
No. I want you to be
my campaign manager.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.394
Okay, you know
how to organize

07:58.477 --> 08:00.104
and you know how to fight.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.104
Yeah,

08:00.188 --> 08:02.398
I know how to fight
against the system, Maya, not...

08:02.481 --> 08:04.150
not for it.

08:02.481 --> 08:04.150
Okay, but why
throw rocks

08:04.233 --> 08:05.693
at an ivory tower
when you can burn it down

08:05.776 --> 08:07.528
from the inside, okay?

08:07.612 --> 08:08.905
If I get a seat, I can actually
change stuff around here.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.574
I'm gonna need
some compensation.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.574
How about

08:11.657 --> 08:13.492
my everlasting friendship

08:13.576 --> 08:17.747
How about you cover my shift
on Monday?

08:17.830 --> 08:20.458
Bella and I have a video date.

08:20.541 --> 08:20.917
Okay.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.251
Deal.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.587
Go!

08:22.335 --> 08:24.587
(barking)

08:24.670 --> 08:26.214
Get it, get it, get it.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.173
Come back!

08:27.256 --> 08:29.008
That's a good girl!

08:29.091 --> 08:31.219
You're bouncy
today. (laughs)

08:31.302 --> 08:33.596
You know, I think
it's the elections--
The more I think about it,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.723
the more I think I might
actually kick ass at it.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.017
Oh, there's nothing
"might" about it.
(laughs)

08:38.100 --> 08:39.977
It's just that, I don't know,
people who grow up

08:40.061 --> 08:42.980
from the part of town
where I grew up
don't do things like this.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.233
That's why it's always
the Putnams and the Fernsbys

08:45.316 --> 08:48.069
and the Coopers who end up
running everything.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.069
Out. Yeah.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.779
No offense.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.779
No, none taken.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.405
My family is

08:51.489 --> 08:54.325
singularly unable to stay away
from a political tangle.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.868
(laughs)

08:54.408 --> 08:55.868
You know,

08:55.952 --> 08:57.245
if you make it through
this first round,

08:57.328 --> 08:58.496
you're gonna have to debate
the other candidates.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.249
I know. I've been doing
my research,

09:01.332 --> 09:02.792
channeling
my inner Socrates,

09:02.875 --> 09:04.752
and if that doesn't work,

09:04.835 --> 09:07.171
I'm just gonna throw some
<i>Real Housewives</i> at them. Ready?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.422
This is you.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.799
This is me.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.799
Yeah,

09:09.882 --> 09:12.635
that's gonna play
really well in Greylock.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.011
(both laugh)

09:14.095 --> 09:15.972
How does Adam feel
about you running?

09:16.055 --> 09:19.433
He's okay with it.
(clears throat)

09:16.055 --> 09:19.433
That enthusiastic, huh?

09:19.517 --> 09:20.977
He just wants
to protect me.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.895
He really thinks our
little local election

09:22.979 --> 09:23.813
is gonna get that dirty?

09:23.896 --> 09:26.190
Um, our leader
just got smeared

09:26.274 --> 09:28.234
all over the American media.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.820
And, oh, by the way, I've been
doing some digging on Weston,

09:30.903 --> 09:32.905
and it looks like
taking down big shots

09:32.989 --> 09:34.323
is kind of his thing.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.075
Yeah, I know, I read
all his stuff, too.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.743
I think it's less
"taking down big shots"

09:37.827 --> 09:39.161
and more "speaking
truth to power,"

09:39.245 --> 09:41.789
which, honestly, I like.

09:41.872 --> 09:45.334
Even if you're the "power"?

09:41.872 --> 09:45.334
Yeah, I guess I'm still
getting used to that part.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.920
Just... mm,
be careful with him.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.755
He's already called
me a dictator

09:49.839 --> 09:51.549
to an audience
of millions.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.010
What more could he do?

09:51.632 --> 09:54.010
I don't know.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.511
But I know that handsome men

09:55.594 --> 09:59.015
always find new ways
to ambush you.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.727
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

10:07.606 --> 10:10.026
"Vote for Danny Cooper"?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.111
Sorry.
Sorry.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.779
You realize other people
stay here, right?

10:13.863 --> 10:15.615
Four months ago,
you tried to bulldoze Greylock.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.408
Now you're gonna try
and represent it?

10:17.491 --> 10:18.826
My bosses were always
gonna put someone

10:18.909 --> 10:19.452
from Lydon into congress,
so I raised my hand.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.329
Oh, lucky me.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.830
How are you even
eligible to run?

10:22.913 --> 10:24.582
You live in a hotel.
You're not a resident.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.251

all 350 of us.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.587
Sorry, sis, but 16%
of your voting population

10:29.670 --> 10:31.255
cashes checks
with Lydon Industries.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.381
A<i> Fortune</i> 500

10:32.465 --> 10:34.383
is not what democracy
looks like.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.718
A group of voters uniting
in service of a common cause

10:35.801 --> 10:37.636
is exactly what democracy
looks like.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.097
You just don't like the voters.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.849
But, hey, if you're
really that unhappy about it,

10:41.932 --> 10:44.310
you could always go back
to dictatorship.
Oh.

10:44.393 --> 10:45.603
What did that article
call you again?

10:45.686 --> 10:46.979
Don't...

10:47.063 --> 10:48.064

15:23.047 --> 15:24.340
Besides, I can't handle this

15:24.423 --> 15:26.342

for one person.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.926
When's the last time
you-you took a break?

15:28.010 --> 15:30.012
Yeah, I have no idea.
Maybe, like, um,

15:30.095 --> 15:30.763
that concert we went to
the day before

15:30.846 --> 15:32.848
my brother arrived.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.232
we had to hitchhike home from
that pet store in Albany.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.526
Yeah, but you also met
Beth Ditto.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.527
Yeah, I trust you.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.363
Good.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.991
Meet me here after the debate.
I got a surprise for you.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.242
What kind of surprise?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.036
The kind that's a surprise.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.247
VINCE:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

15:57.331 --> 15:59.375
<i>the results</i>
<i>of the preliminary round are i.</i>

15:59.458 --> 16:02.628
The six candidates for
the final runoff election are:

16:02.711 --> 16:04.505
Amy Johnson...

16:02.711 --> 16:04.505
(cheering, applause)

16:04.588 --> 16:06.548
...Daniel Cooper,

16:06.632 --> 16:08.384
Olive Platt, Corinne Dearborn...

16:08.467 --> 16:09.593
WOMAN:
All right, Corinne!

16:09.677 --> 16:11.053
...Elizabeth Fernsby...

16:11.136 --> 16:12.304
MAN:
All right, Liz!

16:12.388 --> 16:13.639
...and Maya Jiménez.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.391
(crowd cheering)

16:15.474 --> 16:18.519
We look forward to seeing
you all at the debate tonight.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.479
Hey, congrats, AJ.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.479
Oh, thank you.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.442
ALEXIS:
Hey.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.319
I just heard that you made it
to the runoff.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.196
Congratulations.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.406
Oh, so now you want
to talk to me?

16:30.489 --> 16:32.700
I'm really sorry
that I haven't called, okay?

16:32.783 --> 16:36.203
Uh, William has been
very present lately.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.455
Of course. I'm sure
he's excited about the baby.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.291
I'm sorry, what?

16:38.539 --> 16:41.291
Don't stand here and lie to me.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.419
I found the pregnancy
test, Alexis.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.003
You, you snooped in my...

16:45.087 --> 16:46.422
I was cleaning up,

16:46.505 --> 16:47.131
and I found it.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.841
And like a good girlf...

16:48.924 --> 16:51.593
whatever I am to you,

16:51.677 --> 16:53.262
I waited for you
to tell me about it.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.805
Spoiler alert: you didn't.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.265
So, yeah,
I'm a little pissed off.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.766
AJ.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.766
Look, I get
you're married.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.601
That was a part of the deal
when we started. But a baby

16:59.685 --> 17:01.812
is different.

17:01.895 --> 17:02.771
And then you fill
my head with BS

17:02.855 --> 17:04.481
about you being crazy about me.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.650
Meanwhile, you're starting
an 18-year re-up

17:06.734 --> 17:08.152
with your husband.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.653
Behind my back.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.653
You don't...

17:09.737 --> 17:12.114
WILLIAM:
Oh. Officer Johnson.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.533
We just heard.
Congrats on the runoff.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.870
Congrats to you, too.
A new baby is so exciting.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.371
What?

17:25.836 --> 17:30.048
Alexis, you're pregnant?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.925
Oh...

17:42.186 --> 17:45.022
Why is there a disco ball
in my walk-in?

17:45.105 --> 17:47.191
I'm doing something for Sarah.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.191
Ah.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.486
And is this, uh,
sudden burst of boldness

17:50.569 --> 17:53.614
related to the charming reporter
that's been sneaking around?

17:53.697 --> 17:56.325
He's not that charming.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.325
Uh, he is that charming.

17:56.408 --> 18:00.412
Maybe, maybe me seeing
him make cow eyes at her

18:00.496 --> 18:01.872
sped up the process
a little bit,

18:01.955 --> 18:03.874
but it was bound to happen.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.879
What?

18:08.962 --> 18:10.047
N-Nothing.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.256
That's not a "nothing" look.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.634
Is this the first date

18:13.717 --> 18:15.594
that you've gone on since...?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.180
I-I'm sorry for even
bringing it up.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.099
It's okay. Patience is gone,
and I'm here

18:21.183 --> 18:24.186
with an absolutely perfect woman
who I'm pretty sure is into me.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.897
So, yeah. It's time to move on.

18:26.980 --> 18:27.940
Of course.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.067
I'm good.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.401
(laughs):
I'm good.

18:34.071 --> 18:37.449
WESTON:
<i>Uh, good evening.</i>

18:37.533 --> 18:40.786
Welcome to Greylock's inaugural
legislative primary debate.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.162
To those of you here tonight
and those of you

18:42.246 --> 18:43.539
listening from home,
I'm Weston Woods

18:43.622 --> 18:46.083
of<i> The Yorkshire,</i>
and as an impartial observer,

18:46.166 --> 18:47.626
I'm honored to have been asked

18:47.709 --> 18:49.211
to moderate
this evening's event.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.255
Each candidate will give
their opening statement,

18:51.338 --> 18:54.508
then we'll move
to a roundtable discussion.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.844
This is your chance to get
to know your candidates.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.720
I look forward
to an enlightening evening.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.722
(applause)

19:00.806 --> 19:04.143
The most important issue facing
Greylock today is identity.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.563
Who are we?
But more importantly,

19:07.646 --> 19:09.273
who do we want to be?

19:09.356 --> 19:11.900
We are a nation of tradition.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.319
But we are also
a home for innovation.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.029
A place for second chances.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.991
A land of wild
and untamed beauty.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.492
A community of strength.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.244
A harbor from the storm.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.244
(applause)

19:22.327 --> 19:24.288
AJ:
<i>We founded this country</i>

19:24.371 --> 19:26.123
to get rid of Lydon.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.792
Why would we put one of their
lackeys in our government?

19:28.876 --> 19:31.086
I'm a son of Greylock.
This place shaped me.

19:31.169 --> 19:33.505
I'm just looking for an
opportunity to return the favor.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.424
Government works best
as a team of rivals.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.260
We can't have a congress
of Sarah's flunkies

19:38.343 --> 19:40.512
rubber-stamping her every whim.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.930
Sarah's roommate,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.265
Sarah's brother,
Sarah's best friend,

19:43.348 --> 19:44.558
Sarah's devotee.

19:44.641 --> 19:45.809
Former devotee.

19:45.893 --> 19:46.935
LIZ:
How are we
supposed to have

19:47.019 --> 19:48.896
independent oversight
if Sarah owns

19:48.979 --> 19:49.855
half the candidates?

19:48.979 --> 19:49.855
(applause)

19:49.938 --> 19:51.106
AJ:
No one owns me.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.524
And just because
I live with Sarah

19:52.608 --> 19:54.276
doesn't mean I can't tell her

19:54.359 --> 19:55.277
where to stick it and
when it needs to be stuck.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.528
MAYA:
New ideas

19:56.612 --> 19:58.280
are exactly
what this country needs.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.824
And to get new ideas,
we need new faces.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.744
My family has been in
Greylock since its founding.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.370
We declared
independence

20:05.454 --> 20:06.830
so we could stay who we were.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.373
CORINNE:
I love

20:08.457 --> 20:09.708
Greylock's unique history,

20:09.791 --> 20:11.460
but a country
isn't a hot dog stand.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.503
You can't rely on the
same formula forever.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.673
The world is changing.
We have to change with it.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.217
(applause)

20:19.301 --> 20:20.969
You know, I could see why you
would say that, Ms. Dearborn.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.221
Because if anyone
would benefit

20:23.305 --> 20:25.140
from forgetting the past,
it's you.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.517
Uh, what do you mean by that?

20:27.601 --> 20:28.894
You know, most
people wrote you off

20:28.977 --> 20:31.480
when you became another
teen pregnancy statistic,

20:31.563 --> 20:34.733
but you certainly
have made the most

20:34.816 --> 20:36.193
of your youthful mistakes.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.697
Sorr-- My-my youth--
my youthful mistakes?

20:40.781 --> 20:42.658
What-- Uh, what do you,
what do you mean by that?

20:42.741 --> 20:45.494
Are you calling
my son a mistake?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.249
Hey, bitch in the ugly blouse,

20:50.332 --> 20:51.750
did you just call
my son a mistake?

20:50.332 --> 20:51.750
(people gasping)

20:51.833 --> 20:52.960
Because I swear to God,
if you even...

20:53.043 --> 20:54.670
This election

20:54.753 --> 20:57.339
is just the first step
in a long journey

20:57.422 --> 20:59.591
toward Greylock's future.
I suggest

20:59.675 --> 21:01.843
we worry less about
what we've done,

21:01.927 --> 21:02.678
focus more on

21:02.761 --> 21:04.888
what we can do.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.607
I.D.
SARAH:
Grover, what...?

21:15.691 --> 21:17.192
Excuse me, Miss, uh-uh,

21:17.275 --> 21:19.820
you can't come in here
without an I.D.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.866
It's me, I promise.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.119
(laughs)

21:29.454 --> 21:31.873
Enjoy your night.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.873
Thank you.

21:43.301 --> 21:45.137
Hi.

21:45.220 --> 21:49.224
You look like a...
whiskey ginger type.

21:49.307 --> 21:51.685
How did you know?

21:51.768 --> 21:52.436
Lucky guess.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.648
Grover, this is amazing.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.569
Why did you do all of this?

22:00.652 --> 22:02.404
'Cause you deserve
a night out.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.115
And I figured since I couldn't
get you to a club

22:05.198 --> 22:08.744
before the elections,
I'd bring the club to you.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.917
Thank you.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.085
Cheers.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.920

I think you have said
more than enough today.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.601
Why the hell do you think
you have the right

to talk to my husband?!

23:14.684 --> 23:16.770

23:16.853 --> 23:18.605
I know I messed up.

23:18.688 --> 23:19.731
You want to know why I didn't
tell you about the baby?

23:19.815 --> 23:20.899
Huh? Because there is no baby.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.193
You lost it?

23:23.276 --> 23:25.195
I had an abortion.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.489
I missed my period
and I took a test

23:27.572 --> 23:28.740
and I had no idea
where my marriage was going

23:28.824 --> 23:31.701
and I had no idea
what you and I were doing

23:31.785 --> 23:35.413
and I was, I-I was in no place
to be a mother.

23:35.497 --> 23:39.000
So I told William
that I was gonna go see

23:39.084 --> 23:41.962
an old college friend
and I went to the city and...

23:44.047 --> 23:45.966
And I wanted to tell you.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.052
I wanted to
call you.

23:49.136 --> 23:53.765
I just needed a few more days
to get my head on straight.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.395
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.272
Yeah, of course you didn't know.

24:00.355 --> 24:03.066
You didn't know
because you didn't ask me.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.526
Instead of asking me,
you just went off half-cocked

24:04.609 --> 24:06.945
with your own delusions
and then you spewed

24:07.028 --> 24:08.613
those delusions at my husband.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.364
I was angry.

24:09.447 --> 24:11.032
No. Stay away from me.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.537
And I was confused
and I was hurt.

24:15.620 --> 24:19.916
Yeah, well, you know,
so am I, AJ, so am I.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.836
And I'm also married

24:22.919 --> 24:25.797
to a good and compassionate man
who doesn't deserve any of this.

24:25.881 --> 24:29.968
So... I am going to go
to New York with that man

24:30.051 --> 24:32.679
and I'm gonna see if there's
anything left of our marriage

24:32.762 --> 24:34.222
that we can save.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.226
What did you tell him
about the pregnancy?

24:38.310 --> 24:42.981
That is none of your business.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.359
Does he know about us?

24:47.235 --> 24:48.987
No.

24:52.741 --> 24:56.995
There is a world
where this ended

24:57.078 --> 24:58.455
so differently.

♪ Can't even sing for words ♪

25:39.871 --> 25:42.499

I'm far too shameful. ♪

25:45.377 --> 25:47.337
(music stops)

25:52.092 --> 25:54.469
(kissing)

26:08.191 --> 26:09.818
Grover?

26:12.320 --> 26:12.487
Uh, sorry.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.366
Uh, I sh-- I sh-- I...

26:16.449 --> 26:17.575
I sh-- I shouldn't have.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.290
Sometimes you look at me
like you need me to breathe,

26:23.373 --> 26:25.667
and then, other times,

26:25.750 --> 26:27.919
you can't stand to be
in the same room with me.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.883
I knew you weren't ready,
I just really wanted you to be.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.177
I'm sorry.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.177
No, no, no, no.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.262
I-I want you, Sarah.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.807
I do. But, um...

26:40.890 --> 26:43.184
I-- Oh, God.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.563
I can't.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.733
I just can't.

26:52.152 --> 26:55.822
It's okay.

26:55.905 --> 26:57.782
I get it.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.786
When you are ready...

27:04.122 --> 27:05.623
...you're gonna make
someone else incredibly happy.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.128
"Someone else."

27:17.344 --> 27:21.014
(sniffles)

27:21.097 --> 27:22.932
(crying softly)

27:30.440 --> 27:32.692
So...

27:32.776 --> 27:34.903
he just couldn't get over
that Patience hurdle, huh?

27:34.986 --> 27:36.112
I don't know why
I thought he would.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.990
It's hard,

27:39.074 --> 27:41.743
feeling something for somebody
so long,

27:41.826 --> 27:44.579
and coming to terms
with the fact

27:44.662 --> 27:46.790
that they can't reciprocate.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.253
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

27:52.337 --> 27:56.007
'Cause clearly that little
speech wasn't just for me.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.929
(sighs)

28:01.012 --> 28:01.721
For the past few months,
I've been sleeping

28:01.805 --> 28:03.765
with Alexis Whitmore.

28:04.599 --> 28:07.894
But as of last night...

28:07.977 --> 28:10.271
I basically dynamited
Alexis's marriage

28:10.355 --> 28:12.774
and our affair.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.488
So, yeah.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.615
I'm batting
a thousand over here.

28:42.303 --> 28:44.055
(exhales)
That's better.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.644
Looking like a snack
in those pants, Charlie.

28:49.727 --> 28:53.189
(chuckling):
Yeah... yeah.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.691
Oh.

28:58.319 --> 28:59.487
Hey, shorty.

29:00.738 --> 29:01.906
Got to admit,

29:01.990 --> 29:03.116
you did way better
last night

29:03.199 --> 29:03.867
than I thought
you would.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.870
What does he want?

29:09.122 --> 29:10.832
It's funny you should ask.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.334
You still have to get
through the final election.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.337
And you need me.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.882
But I need all that.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.762
"ATV access in Hargis Preserve"?

29:24.846 --> 29:28.016
"Homecoming as a
national holiday"?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.684
Mm-hmm.

29:29.767 --> 29:32.353
"Pack the courts
with youthful hotties"?

29:29.767 --> 29:32.353
Uh-huh.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.147
That-That's BS, dude.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.148
That's politics.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.194
Pass.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.614
Look, I go, my votes go with me.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.866
I lose, we all lose.

29:45.533 --> 29:48.077
Yeah, maybe.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.872
Maybe not.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.541
You know how to find me

29:53.625 --> 29:54.751
when you change
your mind.

30:00.507 --> 30:03.343
It's Grover, right?

30:03.426 --> 30:05.178
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

30:06.554 --> 30:07.889
I'm not involved
in the election.

30:07.972 --> 30:11.518
Oh, it's not about the election.
About Sarah.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.770
I don't know.
She's smart, she's kind.

30:15.855 --> 30:16.356
Is she single?

30:16.439 --> 30:18.650
Excuse me?

30:18.733 --> 30:21.319
Does she have
a romantic partner?

30:21.402 --> 30:23.530
What's that got
to do with anything?

30:23.613 --> 30:25.782
Well, Sarah's currently the
youngest head of state on Earth.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.534
And you want to turn her
into a sex object.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.328
No, I want to humanize her.

30:30.411 --> 30:31.746
Show a generation
of young people

30:31.829 --> 30:33.915
that she's just like they are,
with the same hopes and dreams

30:33.998 --> 30:38.253
and, yeah, maybe
the same romantic problems.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.462
Hopefully inspire

30:39.546 --> 30:42.006
a few to follow
in her footsteps, you know?

30:42.090 --> 30:45.134
Yeah. She's single.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.391
(exhales) Hi, Danny.
What are you doing here?

30:51.474 --> 30:53.726
Uh, just talking to the judge
about an easement

30:53.810 --> 30:54.602
on one of our mines. You?

30:53.810 --> 30:54.602
Nice. Um...

30:54.686 --> 30:56.771
I'm... Nothing.

30:56.854 --> 30:58.439
I just...

30:56.854 --> 30:58.439
Wait a minute, you're...

30:58.523 --> 31:00.233
What?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.233
You're not...

31:00.316 --> 31:01.818
What? Giving up?

31:01.901 --> 31:03.111
Packing it in?

31:03.194 --> 31:05.113
Waving the white flag with, uh,

31:05.196 --> 31:06.614
furious abandon? Yes.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.908
Why?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.908
Last night was a disaster.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.785
Liz set a trap,
and I walked into it.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.704
And I made myself at home.

31:12.787 --> 31:13.913
Just another
white trash train wreck.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.833
Okay, there's no
coming back from that.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.626
Liz Fernsby...

31:18.710 --> 31:20.461
is an ass.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.005
She was born an ass,
she lives as an ass,

31:22.088 --> 31:22.922
and she will die
an ass.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.133
Everyone in Greylock knows it.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.634
Just like they know you.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.428
You are not
a train wreck.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.805
You're smart, you're capable,
and you care.

31:30.888 --> 31:33.099
As long as those things
are true,

31:33.182 --> 31:34.350
you'll always have a chance.

31:34.434 --> 31:37.645
When people look at me,
they don't see a leader.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.148
I do. I'm people.

31:40.231 --> 31:40.857
Danny, you don't have to--
It's okay.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.233
All this policy stuff is

31:42.317 --> 31:44.527
over my head anyways.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.527
Why do you always do that?

31:44.611 --> 31:45.820
What?

31:45.903 --> 31:48.615
Pretend to be dumber
than you are.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.122
I know my sister casts
a long shadow.

31:56.205 --> 31:59.292
But that doesn't mean that
you can't cast one of your own.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.213
Tell me how you feel
about Greylock's school system.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.798
Danny, I don't want to...

32:04.297 --> 32:05.798
Tell me.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.842
Okay, well,
now that we're finally

32:07.925 --> 32:09.427
free from America's Jurassic-era

32:09.510 --> 32:11.179
curriculum, we can take a look

32:11.262 --> 32:13.473
at how to holistically
serve all of our students.

32:13.556 --> 32:15.391
Not just the five who test well.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.852
I mean, independence is probably

32:17.935 --> 32:20.021
the best thing
that could have happened

32:20.104 --> 32:20.813
for our children's
futures.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.024
Trust me.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.024
I do.

32:23.107 --> 32:26.069
Now go get the rest
of Greylock to do the same.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.657
Turned and burned,
just how you like 'em, Doris.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.784
There you go.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.784
Mmm.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.452
Hey, what'd the vet say
about Eartha Kitty?

32:34.535 --> 32:36.621
She'll be fine, the little diva.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.081
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

32:38.164 --> 32:38.790
Hey, let me know
if you need anything else.

32:38.873 --> 32:41.376
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.378
(sniffs)
Oh.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.379
What now?

32:44.462 --> 32:46.047
Hunter.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.132
He started a write-in campaign
for himself.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.259
Dude. He'll never win.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.886
Yeah, I think he knows that.

32:51.969 --> 32:53.096
He's trying to make you

32:53.179 --> 32:54.972
regret pissing him off.

32:55.056 --> 32:55.890
Okay, the only thing I regret
is not kicking him in the balls.

32:55.973 --> 32:58.267
(sighs)
But we can spin this.

32:58.351 --> 33:01.270
You know, he pissed off
the whole volleyball team

33:01.354 --> 33:03.189
last year when he called
Emma Donnelly a cow.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.525
Yeah, I'm just, I'm done
chasing the popular kids.

33:05.608 --> 33:06.567
If I'm gonna lose
the election,

33:06.651 --> 33:08.653
I'm at least gonna
keep my pride.

33:08.736 --> 33:10.279
You'll always
have me and Doris.

33:10.363 --> 33:11.906
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

33:11.989 --> 33:13.783
I do always have you and Doris.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.410
And the cross country team,
and with Doris,

33:15.493 --> 33:17.203
you probably got
the senior center vote.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.455
That's my constituency.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.083
The people that everyone else
in Greylock overlooks.

33:22.166 --> 33:24.168
Yeah.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.254
And that dude Charlie,
right, with the plaid pants?

33:26.337 --> 33:27.964
Yeah.
I mean, he loves you.

33:28.047 --> 33:28.715
And he's a bigwig
at the bowling league?

33:28.798 --> 33:31.426
Yeah, and Greg the Goth,

33:31.509 --> 33:32.802
he's really tight with
all of the band kids.

33:32.885 --> 33:35.012
Dude, screw Hunter.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.556
We're gonna build
a country-wide coalition

33:36.639 --> 33:37.432
out of Greylock's misfit toys.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.268
Okay.

33:40.351 --> 33:41.310
Hey.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.979
("Sleep in the Heat"
by PUP playing)

33:49.235 --> 33:52.989
♪ You started falling apart... ♪

33:53.072 --> 33:55.074
Hey. Hey.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.909
That's for undecided voters.

33:56.993 --> 33:57.785
WESTON: I thought you were
going after the youth vote.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.705
I am. And the elderly vote.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.540
And the birders

34:02.623 --> 34:04.208
and the bowling league

34:04.292 --> 34:05.752
who's ever felt left out.

34:05.835 --> 34:08.629
Everybody counts.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.757
Before we get to the results,
I just want to say

34:10.840 --> 34:12.800
how proud I am of everyone.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.303
Our citizens and all

34:15.386 --> 34:16.804
of our candidates, the level
of engagement has been

34:16.888 --> 34:20.475
beyond my wildest dreams and...

34:20.558 --> 34:23.144
I know whoever wins,
they're gonna,

34:23.227 --> 34:25.062
they're gonna pour
their hearts and souls into

34:25.146 --> 34:27.774
helping Greylock grow.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.774
(cheering, applause)

34:30.026 --> 34:30.985
Thank you, Sarah.
All right, here we go.

34:31.068 --> 34:33.654
In order of voting
percentage,

34:33.738 --> 34:35.823
Greylock's
new legislators are...

34:35.907 --> 34:37.450
Amy Johnson...

34:37.533 --> 34:38.576
(cheering, applause)

34:38.659 --> 34:40.787
Daniel Cooper...

34:40.870 --> 34:42.663
and Maya Jiménez.

34:42.747 --> 34:45.708
What?

34:42.747 --> 34:45.708
Yes!

34:45.792 --> 34:49.253
And beating out the fifth place
finisher by just two votes...

34:51.088 --> 34:54.217
...Elizabeth Fernsby!

34:51.088 --> 34:54.217
(screams)

34:54.300 --> 34:57.637
Congratulations to Greylock's
first legislators.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.431
(cheering, clamoring)

35:06.395 --> 35:08.022
The reign of Queen Sarah
hath come to an end.

35:08.105 --> 35:10.191
You'll finally have
some real oversight.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.777
Hey, sorry it didn't work out,
but "A" for effort.

35:12.860 --> 35:13.861
Oh, hey, Liz?
Um, "K" for kiss my...

35:12.860 --> 35:13.861
Hey!

35:13.945 --> 35:16.572
(vocalizing)
Sorry.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.699
She's just-- What a...
douche canoe.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.284
Yeah, okay, yeah,
I know, but she's,

35:20.368 --> 35:21.869
she's my douche canoe now.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.831
So paddle upstream.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.831
Okay.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.582
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.710
So... how's it feel to be
a government official?

35:29.794 --> 35:31.170
I don't think
it hit me until now

35:31.254 --> 35:33.381
how many people
are actually counting on me.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.841
I just hope
I don't disappoint them.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.841
TYLER: You won't.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.384
You're gonna kill it.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.052
Hey, I just wanted to come say
congratulations.

35:38.135 --> 35:40.847
You two make a really good team.

35:40.930 --> 35:41.556
I was really proud
to vote for you, Maya.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.100
Thanks.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.814
Excuse us, Sarah. This is
kind of a family moment.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.899
Oh, of course, I'm sorry.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.317
AJ:
Alexis?

35:53.401 --> 35:55.027
What are you doing here?

35:55.111 --> 35:57.405
William wanted one of us here
to see the winners.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.199
After everything that happened,
I couldn't exactly say no.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.199
Wait, listen.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.659
I'm sure you don't want
to hear this from me,

36:01.742 --> 36:03.161
but I need to say it anyway.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.871
The truth is...

36:04.954 --> 36:06.664
I was falling for you.

36:06.747 --> 36:09.041
And when I thought you weren't
on the same page as me,

36:09.125 --> 36:10.459
I just got scared.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.964
It's not an excuse
for what I did.

36:15.047 --> 36:16.090
But...

36:16.173 --> 36:19.093
I need you to know
that I'm sorry.

36:19.176 --> 36:21.721
Now I know.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.806

Just one. Uh...

How do you feel

36:44.827 --> 36:47.038
It's a drink.

That's all right,

Yeah, Adam took
Josh home to bed, so...

38:14.458 --> 38:16.585
But not before I got
to hear him ask

38:16.669 --> 38:19.463
if, uh, this result
"makes Mommy a loser."

You were right with what
you said the other day.

38:26.762 --> 38:27.847
I would have
regretted quitting.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.558
So thank you for making me
stand up for myself.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.393
I just gave you a little push
is all.
