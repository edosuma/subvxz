00:47.799 --> 00:49.164
No time for niceties.

00:53.505 --> 00:55.132
Way to be stealthy, Luther.

00:55.307 --> 00:58.037
The moment I shut down the grid,
it sent a silent alarm.

00:58.209 --> 01:00.302
They're already on their way here.

01:08.687 --> 01:10.314
Dibs.

01:18.930 --> 01:21.160
The quantum trigger.

01:21.599 --> 01:23.624
Now we have a chance.

01:30.642 --> 01:32.166
Run.

01:51.496 --> 01:54.431
That's not going
to slow them down for long.

02:00.105 --> 02:02.539
That's not gonna slow them down at all.

02:11.449 --> 02:12.677
What are you waiting for?

02:14.252 --> 02:15.742
Hurry.

02:18.022 --> 02:19.853
It's time to get serious, Lex.

02:20.024 --> 02:22.424
No. We can make it together.
We can do this.

02:23.294 --> 02:26.195
Get your shiny bald head out of here.
It's hurting my eyes.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.442
What can I say?

02:56.261 --> 02:57.489
Okay, okay.

02:58.763 --> 03:01.561
I'm down to my Last Joke, anyway.

03:02.467 --> 03:04.958
But this one will kill you.

03:13.111 --> 03:15.773
It won't be in vain, old friend.

03:15.947 --> 03:17.915
ULTRAMAN:
Luthor.

03:26.591 --> 03:29.754
You think you can hide
from my ultra-vision?

03:29.928 --> 03:31.919
You're gonna pay
for what you've done, mate.

03:32.096 --> 03:35.031
- That's a promise.
- I've gotta a promise of my own.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.294
I'm going to finish the Job
the Jester started.

03:41.573 --> 03:42.631
But not Just yet.

06:40.518 --> 06:43.783
The work would go a lot faster
if l were up there with you, guys.

06:43.955 --> 06:46.355
Patience. I'm almost ready for you.

06:46.791 --> 06:48.554
How much is all this costing, Bruce?

06:49.193 --> 06:51.320
I don't like to think about it.

06:51.496 --> 06:53.794
All right, Flash. Beginning test run.

06:54.932 --> 06:56.991
l don't know, Batman.
This is pretty radical.

06:57.168 --> 06:58.692
You're absolutely sure it works?

06:59.103 --> 07:00.798
Pretty sure.

07:00.972 --> 07:03.167
Pretty sure? That isn't--

07:04.742 --> 07:06.004
--good enough.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.479
TeIeporter's on-line.

07:11.983 --> 07:13.177
Are you crazy?

07:13.618 --> 07:14.710
Is he crazy?

07:14.886 --> 07:17.286
How could he use that thing on me
if he wasn't sure?

07:17.455 --> 07:19.685
- He was Joking.
- Yeah, how can you tell?

07:20.058 --> 07:22.925
You really think he would risk your life
if he wasn't sure?

07:23.327 --> 07:25.318
Well, maybe.

07:25.496 --> 07:27.657
I mean, I don't think he likes me
very much.

07:27.832 --> 07:30.858
I don't think he likes anyone very much.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.044
Good morning.

07:50.221 --> 07:54.590
Would you be kind enough to tell me where
I could find the nearest police station?

08:03.935 --> 08:06.028
Excuse me, it's very important that I--

08:06.204 --> 08:07.899
Yeah, yeah. Cool your Jets.

08:08.072 --> 08:10.700
This is a police station.
Everything's important he--

08:10.875 --> 08:12.672
Luthor.

08:14.412 --> 08:15.970
No need to make a scene.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.581
I want you to contact
the Justice League for me.

08:18.750 --> 08:19.808
Or else?

08:20.752 --> 08:21.878
Oh, I don't know.

08:22.053 --> 08:23.918
I'll destroy the world?

08:24.088 --> 08:25.817
Is that sufficient?

08:31.095 --> 08:32.357
Superman. Go ahead.

08:32.530 --> 08:33.690
BATMAN:
We've got a problem.

08:33.865 --> 08:34.991
One of yours.

08:40.371 --> 08:42.168
It's okay. We'll take it from here.

08:48.279 --> 08:50.338
Oh, and they call me The Flash.

08:50.515 --> 08:53.177
- What do you think you're doing?
- I've come to talk.

08:53.351 --> 08:55.911
As you can see, I'm not armed.

08:58.756 --> 09:01.816
You're going to find what I have to say
very difficult to believe.

09:01.993 --> 09:03.654
You're from a parallel Earth.

09:03.828 --> 09:05.489
How could you possibly know that?

09:05.663 --> 09:09.224
Your internal organs are reversed,
your heart is on the wrong side.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.662
It could be a trick.

09:11.068 --> 09:12.262
Could be.

09:15.673 --> 09:18.437
But our Luthor's still in his cell
on Stryker's Island.

09:18.609 --> 09:21.806
And now that we've clarified the matter
of my evil twin...

09:21.979 --> 09:24.641
...I've got quite a story to tell you.

09:25.449 --> 09:26.473
Pants.

09:27.752 --> 09:28.776
Oh.

09:33.624 --> 09:38.254
My world is similar to yours in many ways
but very different in others.

09:38.429 --> 09:39.919
Oh, wait, wait, don't tell me.

09:40.097 --> 09:42.725
On your world,
you're the leader of the Justice League.

09:43.201 --> 09:45.499
As a matter of fact, I was.

09:46.037 --> 09:47.061
Past tense.

09:47.505 --> 09:50.440
I'm not Just the Leader
of my world's Justice League.

09:50.608 --> 09:53.543
I'm its only surviving member.

09:53.711 --> 09:57.841
We were systematically destroyed
by a group of super powered beings...

09:58.015 --> 09:59.846
...known as the Crime Syndicate.

10:00.384 --> 10:04.013
They've run rampant for years,
doing whatever they pleased.

10:04.488 --> 10:06.012
They rule through fear...

10:06.390 --> 10:10.690
...occasionally turning their powers
against the populace, Just to remind us.

10:10.862 --> 10:13.592
In the hope of maintaining
some minimal order...

10:13.764 --> 10:16.324
...the authorities simply pretend
they aren't there.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.594
But increasingly,
they refuse to be ignored.

10:20.238 --> 10:23.332
The Syndicate
has completely intimidated civil authority.

10:23.507 --> 10:24.974
The police won't arrest them...

10:25.142 --> 10:28.077
...and prosecutors
wouldn't press charges if they did.

10:28.613 --> 10:32.515
The only thing keeping them from
completely overthrowing the government...

10:32.683 --> 10:34.674
...is the threat of a nuclear response.

10:34.852 --> 10:38.379
You people are my world's last hope.

10:41.259 --> 10:43.523
We have to discuss this.

10:45.696 --> 10:47.926
Please wait out here.

11:04.882 --> 11:07.749
- I don't trust him.
- There's a surprise.

11:07.919 --> 11:11.320
Maybe he's on the up and up.
You said yourself, he's not our Luthor.

11:11.489 --> 11:13.753
Still, never met a Luthor I liked.

11:14.191 --> 11:16.625
I've read his mind, he's telling the truth.

11:16.794 --> 11:18.625
Regardless, we have a responsibility...

11:18.796 --> 11:21.458
...to the millions of people
being oppressed on his world.

11:21.632 --> 11:24.430
For all my power, when it comes down to it,
I'm a beat cop.

11:24.602 --> 11:27.662
There are rules. Another dimension
may be out of our Jurisdiction.

11:28.139 --> 11:31.836
I can't believe we're having this discussion.
Of course we're going to help.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.943
She's right. That's what we do.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.750
- Not this time.
- Why not?

11:41.252 --> 11:43.277
We've got too much on our plate
right here.

11:43.454 --> 11:46.184
We haven't even finished constructing
our new headquarters.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.985
Our first responsibility
is to protect the Earth.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.321
That's right. Our Earth.

11:51.495 --> 11:54.020
We don't have enough manpower
to even do that properly.

11:54.565 --> 11:57.295
Fair enough.
But we're talking about millions of people.

11:57.468 --> 12:01.063
We can't Just turn our backs.
We have to go.

12:10.281 --> 12:12.476
All right, Luthor, we'll help.

12:12.950 --> 12:13.974
But we need a plan.

12:14.452 --> 12:16.716
I have one, of course.

12:44.548 --> 12:46.243
What's so fascinating?

12:46.417 --> 12:49.147
Luthor has solved
the decoherence problem.

12:49.320 --> 12:53.256
Darling, unless there's money involved,
you're still boring me.

12:53.591 --> 12:55.286
Parallel Earth's.

12:55.459 --> 12:57.825
Luthor is not only proven they exist...

12:57.995 --> 13:00.987
...he's figured out
how to travel between them.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.024
Any sign of the quantum trigger?

13:03.567 --> 13:07.230
We've searched the entire complex.
If it was here, it's not now.

13:07.805 --> 13:08.829
Right.

13:09.006 --> 13:12.237
Download all these records
into my personal computer.

13:12.576 --> 13:17.275
The rest of you, strip this place
of anything useful, then destroy it.

13:28.893 --> 13:32.761
This could be disorienting,
but there are no other side effects that--

13:32.930 --> 13:34.022
What the hell?

13:34.198 --> 13:35.392
We're compromised.

13:35.566 --> 13:36.590
What tipped you off?

13:37.068 --> 13:39.536
I don't have time for this.
I need that data.

13:39.703 --> 13:41.034
Take them down.

13:48.145 --> 13:49.442
That will be enough of that.

15:14.965 --> 15:18.196
- That's what I call tuning somebody up.
WOMAN: Excuse me.

15:19.603 --> 15:22.037
Can I talk to you for a minute?

15:37.621 --> 15:39.111
Hera.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.438
I've played this game before.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.242
You don't wanna fight me.

16:06.417 --> 16:07.577
You wanna help me.

16:08.185 --> 16:11.313
I don't wanna fight you, I want....

16:11.488 --> 16:13.683
Hey, this is like the Jedi mind trick.

16:14.124 --> 16:16.752
This is not like the Jedi mind trick.

16:17.194 --> 16:20.357
This is not like the Jedi mind trick.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.594
Sorry.

16:54.164 --> 16:56.098
J'onn J'onzz:
Stop that.

17:00.404 --> 17:01.803
We've got to retreat.

17:01.972 --> 17:03.439
Why? We're winning.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.336
Superwoman's called in the cavalry...

17:05.509 --> 17:08.000
...and if it's who I think it is,
we're not prepared.

17:08.178 --> 17:10.112
Don't make us guess.
What are we in for?

17:10.281 --> 17:13.182
At least three Made Men,
almost as tough as Superwoman.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.175
- Made Men?
- Later.

17:15.352 --> 17:16.842
I don't have time to explain.

17:17.021 --> 17:18.784
Follow me.

17:26.864 --> 17:28.695
FLASH:
Oh, crap.

17:33.270 --> 17:35.204
GREEN LANTERN:
I've got you.

17:49.753 --> 17:51.380
Heads up.

18:14.978 --> 18:16.912
More trouble.

18:38.202 --> 18:40.329
Get off my plane.

20:19.703 --> 20:22.035
Is that one of us in Owlman's plane?

20:22.206 --> 20:24.174
Two of us. Wonder Woman swiped it.

20:24.341 --> 20:27.105
Then there may be a way out of this.
Swing around for me.

20:48.365 --> 20:50.731
Stay on top of him. The plane is mine.

20:58.141 --> 20:59.904
Where is it? What are you looking for?

21:00.077 --> 21:03.069
Chameleon circuit.
Owlman used to drive me crazy--

21:04.581 --> 21:06.742
Found it. What's it do?

21:22.866 --> 21:25.664
Lantern, we're cloaked right above you.

21:26.169 --> 21:28.967
Hold fire, our ride's here.

21:35.479 --> 21:37.106
- Hang on.
- Whoa!

21:38.515 --> 21:39.539
Ooh!

21:42.185 --> 21:44.915
Strafe the skies.

22:03.707 --> 22:04.935
Well, that's fried.

22:05.108 --> 22:07.542
It doesn't matter, we're still cloaked.

22:07.711 --> 22:10.111
WONDER WOMAN: And we've lost them.
At least for the moment.

22:10.547 --> 22:13.710
So, genius, where to now?

22:15.252 --> 22:17.243
JOHNNY QUICK:
Yeah, handed them a right thumping...

22:17.421 --> 22:20.254
- ...I heard, let the blinking side down a bit.
ULTRAMAN: Come to order.

22:21.258 --> 22:22.418
First business.

22:22.593 --> 22:25.687
We've gotta decide
who we're calling up to replace J'arkus.

22:25.862 --> 22:26.988
God rest his soul.

22:27.464 --> 22:29.955
There's no managerial talent
in that organization.

22:30.133 --> 22:32.761
We should dissolve them
and spilt up his territory.

22:32.936 --> 22:36.269
Right, seems to me you've already helped
yourself to the Martian's crew.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.305
You had the whole bunch this morning.

22:38.709 --> 22:42.236
Made Men need to be associated
with one of the family heads...

22:42.412 --> 22:43.777
...if you want some of them.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.177
We can horse-trade
for manpower any time.

22:46.350 --> 22:48.614
- What about the turf?
SUPERWOMAN: I'm with Owlman.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.912
We'll divide his action
between the five of us.

22:51.088 --> 22:52.646
Who died and made you boss?

22:53.123 --> 22:54.818
You wanna arm wrestle for it?

22:54.992 --> 22:56.254
Knock it off.

22:56.426 --> 22:58.053
We'll work out details later.

22:58.228 --> 23:01.095
For now, Owlman can keep
J'edd J'arkus' guys.

23:01.264 --> 23:04.495
From what I hear, sounds like
you could have used a few dozen more.

23:05.102 --> 23:08.230
Luthor's new Justice League
is not be underestimated.

23:08.405 --> 23:10.771
Neither are we. They'll fold.

23:10.941 --> 23:12.135
Or we'll fold them.

23:12.309 --> 23:14.675
Just like everybody else
who gets in our way.

23:14.845 --> 23:17.245
Which brings us to the topic at hand.

23:17.414 --> 23:21.578
Last meeting, five of six family heads
approved of Project Damocles.

23:21.752 --> 23:26.712
Per our vote, I have begun construction
on this, the quantum eigenstate device.

23:26.890 --> 23:32.487
Once completed, the QED will give us
life-and-death power over the entire planet.

23:32.963 --> 23:36.228
We spent 37 billion on government bribes
last year.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.891
No more of that.
We'll be the government.

23:39.069 --> 23:42.732
I still don't see why they would give up
the little bit of power they got left.

23:42.906 --> 23:46.398
Because if they don't, we'll do this.

23:46.576 --> 23:48.874
The device's Heisenberg
uncertainty override...

23:49.046 --> 23:53.073
...allows us to tap into a limitless pool
of destructive energy.

23:57.888 --> 24:00.880
Which leaves the governments
of the world with two choices:

24:01.058 --> 24:04.255
Bow down to us or die.

24:05.762 --> 24:06.990
ROSE:
The thing to remember...

24:07.164 --> 24:09.758
...is we don't have to be afraid
of the Crime Syndicate.

24:09.933 --> 24:12.094
REPORTER: If that's true,
why do you have bodyguards?

24:12.269 --> 24:16.035
Come on, my father's the president.
I had guards before I started speaking out.

24:16.206 --> 24:19.175
Isn't it irresponsible of you
to be out here making speeches...

24:19.342 --> 24:21.776
...in direct contradiction
of your father's policies?

24:21.945 --> 24:26.609
I love my father, but we disagree about this,
and I have the right to free speech.

24:26.783 --> 24:29.547
If we leave the Syndicate be,
they'll Let us live our lives.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.950
- We don't have the power to fight them.
- No.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.885
Might doesn't make right.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.116
It may seem that way,
but in the long run...

24:36.293 --> 24:37.851
...it's the other way around.

24:38.028 --> 24:41.555
We are always stronger
when we're doing the right thing.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.635
LEX:
Lights.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.079
I love what you've done with the place.

24:57.681 --> 25:01.344
LEX: It's not mine.
It used to belong to a friend.

25:08.592 --> 25:09.820
I'm sorry, Harley.

25:09.993 --> 25:12.894
The Jester's never coming back.

25:17.567 --> 25:20.695
We should consider ourselves lucky
there's any place left to hide.

25:20.871 --> 25:24.671
We're not here to hide, Luthor.
We're here to clean up your planet's mess.

25:25.075 --> 25:27.373
Then by all means, let's get started.

25:27.544 --> 25:28.772
And call me Lex.

25:29.780 --> 25:33.113
These are the big guns,
the heads of the six.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.114
I should say, five families.

25:35.285 --> 25:40.655
Ultraman is the boss of bosses,
but they all front formidable organizations.

25:40.824 --> 25:42.951
Where do all those
super powered guys fit in?

25:43.126 --> 25:44.457
LEX:
Each of the family heads...

25:44.628 --> 25:46.653
...have thousands
of criminals working under them.

25:46.830 --> 25:50.288
They reward their most trusted lieutenants
by giving them superpowers.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.230
They're called Made Men.

25:52.402 --> 25:53.699
Cute. How many?

25:53.870 --> 25:56.065
LEX:
No more than seven or eight at a time.

25:56.239 --> 25:57.706
Perhaps 50, total.

25:57.874 --> 26:00.968
We'll conduct a series of attacks,
coordinated by me.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.738
The six of us
will hit specific Syndicate operations...

26:03.914 --> 26:04.972
...one after the other.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.981
- That's a waste of time.
- I beg your pardon?

26:08.151 --> 26:11.552
We're going to hit multiple targets
at the same time. Teams of two.

26:12.055 --> 26:13.522
We'd be hopelessly outnumbered.

26:13.690 --> 26:16.955
- When my Justice League fought them--
- All due respect, Lex.

26:17.127 --> 26:18.651
We aren't your Justice League.

26:19.129 --> 26:20.960
- What's the call?
- You and J'onn.

26:21.131 --> 26:23.156
Diana and GL. He's with me.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.527
That's insane.

26:24.701 --> 26:27.329
- Don't worry, Lex. He's got your slack.
- Flash.

26:28.104 --> 26:29.833
Well, you do.

26:41.084 --> 26:42.847
You're supposed to call first.

26:43.019 --> 26:46.921
What's the point of having your keys
if I can't drop in unexpectedly?

26:47.090 --> 26:48.921
Still Looking for the quantum trigger?

26:49.292 --> 26:53.422
Yes, but in the meantime, I've been working
on something equally interesting.

26:53.864 --> 26:56.662
We can use it to travel
to any of the alternate Earth's.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.733
It's based on Luthor's design.

26:58.902 --> 27:00.494
I've made some improvements.

27:03.473 --> 27:05.600
Do you realize
what we could do with this?

27:05.775 --> 27:08.767
The philosophical implications
are tremendous, of course.

27:08.945 --> 27:10.037
Philosophy.

27:10.213 --> 27:13.944
There's an infinite number of Earth's
out there to conquer. You and me.

27:14.117 --> 27:17.348
We wouldn't have to share our cut
with the Syndicate.

27:18.188 --> 27:20.452
That's certainly one way to go.

28:01.598 --> 28:02.997
Whoa!

29:03.360 --> 29:06.989
- Right, then. Abandon ship if you can.
- Oh! Oh!

30:17.267 --> 30:18.859
- I got her.
- No.

30:19.302 --> 30:21.202
She's mine.

30:58.441 --> 31:01.774
Ultraman, I know you can hear me.

31:01.945 --> 31:05.938
Bring your arrogant ass out here
or we'll come in and get you.

31:09.586 --> 31:13.454
Not Looking for the hired help, Olsen.
I want your boss.

31:13.623 --> 31:14.647
He ain't here.

31:14.824 --> 31:17.349
If you want an appointment,
you can call his secretary.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.358
Clear our airspace.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.229
Make me.

31:21.397 --> 31:23.763
I can do that.

31:24.634 --> 31:27.831
You take care of Ultraman's pal.
I got the big guy.

31:31.674 --> 31:34.575
I'd rather not have to hurt you, Jimmy.

31:46.089 --> 31:48.557
You sure you want to do this?
I can take him.

31:48.725 --> 31:52.058
If it's going to mean anything
after you're gone, it has to be me.

31:56.366 --> 31:57.924
Get your hands off my boy.

31:58.535 --> 32:00.298
You've got problems of your own.

32:05.408 --> 32:06.739
Getting cocky, Lex?

32:14.517 --> 32:18.180
You think you can come
to my place of business and call me out?

32:24.661 --> 32:26.060
Ooh!

32:29.832 --> 32:33.359
Did you forget who I am?
How I got to be the boss of bosses?

32:33.536 --> 32:36.369
I'm here
because I'm the baddest of the bad.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.939
Anybody whoever stood in my way
is dead.

32:39.108 --> 32:41.076
Everybody.

32:43.379 --> 32:46.576
I brought you a present.

32:52.722 --> 32:54.587
[WEAKLY]
Blue kryptonite.

32:54.757 --> 32:56.622
The only thing that can hurt you.

32:57.126 --> 32:58.218
But I--

32:58.394 --> 33:00.191
Destroyed the last piece on Earth?

33:00.363 --> 33:03.355
True. But I've been visiting other Earth's.

33:19.682 --> 33:21.775
You are so gonna regret this.

33:21.951 --> 33:25.284
Got a message for you, big man.
Things are changing.

33:25.455 --> 33:26.683
When you do wrong...

33:26.856 --> 33:29.620
...there are more and more of us
who aren't afraid to set it right.

33:53.783 --> 33:55.410
United States Secret Service.

33:55.585 --> 33:58.076
The president would like a word with you.

33:58.254 --> 33:59.983
WILSON:
This is unacceptable, Lex.

34:00.156 --> 34:03.683
- What do you think you're doing?
LEX: That should be obvious, Mr. President.

34:03.860 --> 34:05.589
We're taking it to the bad guys, sir.

34:05.762 --> 34:07.730
Well, you should be very proud.

34:07.897 --> 34:11.355
Have you given the slightest thought
to the consequences of your actions?

34:11.534 --> 34:13.092
Don't talk to me like a child.

34:13.268 --> 34:16.067
I was fighting this battle long before
your administration...

34:16.239 --> 34:18.297
...decided to roll over for the Syndicate.

34:18.474 --> 34:19.998
We didn't roll over.

34:20.176 --> 34:23.509
We've worked to achieve
a delicate balance with the Crime Syndicate.

34:23.679 --> 34:27.013
It's the only way the American people
can live in relative safety.

34:27.183 --> 34:30.243
Forgive me, Mr. President,
but that's a load of crap.

34:33.690 --> 34:37.217
Be that as it may,
I've already ordered the release of Ultraman.

34:37.393 --> 34:38.587
You did what?

34:38.761 --> 34:40.319
You wanna watch your tone?

34:40.496 --> 34:41.985
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

34:42.165 --> 34:44.895
I Just don't understand
how you could Let them go free.

34:45.068 --> 34:47.592
You clearly don't understand
much of anything.

34:47.770 --> 34:50.967
Do you think anybody would testify
against the Crime Syndicate?

34:51.139 --> 34:54.906
Do you think if anybody were willing,
we could keep them alive until trial?

34:55.777 --> 34:57.405
- We can.
- Oh?

34:57.580 --> 34:59.673
Are you going to protect
their families too?

34:59.849 --> 35:02.340
Are you going to stay here
and watch over us forever?

35:02.518 --> 35:03.542
Obviously not.

35:03.720 --> 35:07.156
But we can stop them right now.
Put an end to their hold over you.

35:07.957 --> 35:09.447
Kill them?

35:09.625 --> 35:11.149
No. We don't do that.

35:12.995 --> 35:14.622
WILSON:
Then I've got a better idea.

35:14.797 --> 35:17.994
Why don't you go home
and end all crime on your own planet?

35:18.167 --> 35:20.761
Why don't you grow a backbone.

35:21.270 --> 35:22.294
Not now, Rose.

35:22.472 --> 35:24.963
Then when, Dad? We've got a chance.

35:25.141 --> 35:26.165
That's a fantasy.

35:26.342 --> 35:30.301
We can't fight these guys
without risking the lives of millions.

35:31.314 --> 35:32.576
ROSE:
My God, Dad.

35:32.749 --> 35:35.684
You were a war hero.
When did you turn into a coward?

35:35.852 --> 35:37.114
J'ONN J'ONZZ:
He is not a coward.

35:37.286 --> 35:38.685
Men who have seen battle...

35:38.855 --> 35:41.119
...are often among those
who hold life most dear.

35:41.290 --> 35:44.054
- How did you know what I was thinking?
- It was an accident.

35:44.227 --> 35:45.785
I didn't mean to read your mind.

35:45.962 --> 35:47.930
There's a saying on my world:

35:48.097 --> 35:52.796
"The only thing necessary for the triumph
of evil is for good men to do nothing."

35:53.202 --> 35:55.295
It's easy for someone like you
to be brave.

35:55.471 --> 35:57.063
But most of us aren't bulletproof.

35:57.240 --> 36:01.142
Sir, I stand up to guys more powerful
than I am all the time.

36:01.310 --> 36:02.743
You can do the same.

36:03.346 --> 36:04.745
That simple, huh?

36:05.415 --> 36:08.680
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but we're not about to give up this fight.

36:08.851 --> 36:11.581
Not when we finally have a chance
to win it.

36:36.512 --> 36:38.844
- Aren't you supposed to be helping?
- I am helping.

36:39.015 --> 36:40.539
I'm improving the ambiance.

36:40.716 --> 36:42.616
In a way, that's what I'm planning to do.

36:42.952 --> 36:46.854
After all, what good is a bomb
if you don't detonate it?

36:49.859 --> 36:53.295
You never had any intention of using
the QED for blackmail.

36:53.463 --> 36:56.227
You're going to use it to kill everybody.

36:57.099 --> 36:58.726
What if I am?

36:59.669 --> 37:01.899
Just tell me. Why?

37:02.071 --> 37:03.834
Why not?

37:04.006 --> 37:05.030
I'm serious.

37:05.208 --> 37:08.234
I'm a murdering psychopath.
It's part of my charm.

37:08.411 --> 37:09.878
I do find it attractive.

37:10.046 --> 37:12.446
But you never make a move
without a reason.

37:12.615 --> 37:14.480
Why would you want to destroy
the world?

37:14.650 --> 37:18.711
Because it's the only action one could take
that would have any purpose.

37:19.422 --> 37:20.719
You Lost me there.

37:23.392 --> 37:26.555
Every decision we make is meaningless...

37:26.963 --> 37:31.457
...because somewhere, on a parallel Earth,
we have already made the opposite choice.

37:31.634 --> 37:33.124
We're nothing.

37:33.302 --> 37:34.894
Less than nothing.

37:35.304 --> 37:36.566
How can you say that?

37:36.739 --> 37:38.969
We're rich. We're conquerors.

37:39.442 --> 37:41.672
And here we're poor. We're slaves.

37:41.844 --> 37:44.904
And here, our parents never met,
so we were never born.

37:45.314 --> 37:47.782
Here, the world ended in nuclear war.

37:47.950 --> 37:51.113
Here, no fish was ever brave enough
to crawl up on land...

37:51.287 --> 37:52.754
...and humans never evolved.

37:52.922 --> 37:55.288
And so on, ad infinitum.

37:55.458 --> 37:58.655
So even if you destroy the world,
there are a billion others, right?

37:58.828 --> 38:00.762
What difference would it make?

38:00.930 --> 38:04.889
Somewhere in the multi verse,
there is a world I call Earth Prime.

38:05.067 --> 38:08.161
Every Earth is a variation of this one,
the original.

38:08.337 --> 38:12.273
And once I destroy it,
all reality will follow.

38:18.180 --> 38:21.581
I take it back.
You're much crazier than I am.

38:22.552 --> 38:24.179
Don't get in my way.

38:24.353 --> 38:26.844
To the contrary.

38:30.359 --> 38:31.917
I'm in.

38:39.802 --> 38:41.269
I thought I might find you here.

38:41.437 --> 38:43.962
- I'm not talking to you.
- Then listen.

38:44.407 --> 38:49.106
You're going to have to stop speaking out
against the Syndicate. At Least in public.

38:49.278 --> 38:53.009
You know, when I was a little girl,
you were my hero.

38:53.182 --> 38:55.412
What's happened to you?

38:56.752 --> 38:58.982
Maybe we both grew up.

39:13.235 --> 39:14.566
ULTRAMAN:
Kids, huh?

39:14.737 --> 39:19.299
They drive us crazy, but we'd still
do anything to protect them. Am I right?

39:21.944 --> 39:23.309
What do you want?

39:23.879 --> 39:25.972
Saw your daughter on the news
the other night.

39:26.148 --> 39:28.343
- She's got a mouth on her.
- It's a free country.

39:28.517 --> 39:30.144
We both know better than that.

39:31.087 --> 39:34.386
You get your little girl under control,
or I'll do it for you.

39:34.757 --> 39:37.157
Remember what happened
to the First Lady.

39:37.326 --> 39:40.022
If you come near my daughter,
I will nuke you.

39:40.196 --> 39:41.322
You hear me?

39:43.733 --> 39:45.394
ULTRAMAN:
Yeah, the nukes.

39:45.568 --> 39:48.162
- Great equalizer, huh?
- Uhn!

39:48.704 --> 39:51.400
Well, Let me tell you something,
Mr. President.

39:51.574 --> 39:54.975
My boys are working up a bomb
of our own.

39:55.845 --> 39:57.210
Nice place.

39:57.380 --> 39:59.245
I think I'm gonna like it here.

40:07.390 --> 40:09.950
I'm getting bored again.
Did you find Earth Prime?

40:10.126 --> 40:12.856
Still Looking. But I found something else.

40:13.329 --> 40:16.025
Luthor took the quantum trigger
to a parallel Earth.

40:16.465 --> 40:17.523
Would you be a dear...

40:17.700 --> 40:20.794
...pop over to the universe next door
and pick it up for me?

40:39.055 --> 40:41.580
COMPUTER VOICE:
Perimeter breach. Potential intruder alert.

40:41.757 --> 40:44.692
Perimeter breach. Potential intruder alert.

40:49.765 --> 40:53.030
It's here. Spread out and find it.

41:12.555 --> 41:15.285
You're on my property. Stand down.

41:15.791 --> 41:17.190
You're in over your head.

41:17.359 --> 41:19.793
Back off before I come over there
and hurt you.

41:23.833 --> 41:25.323
Insect.

42:01.237 --> 42:03.728
Stay down. You're outnumbered.

42:04.573 --> 42:06.541
Count again.

42:14.683 --> 42:17.709
You guys are in trouble.

42:18.788 --> 42:20.847
Take them.

42:29.298 --> 42:31.698
Careful, Aquaman.
They're stronger than you are.

42:33.836 --> 42:36.327
That remains to be seen.

43:22.251 --> 43:24.811
Okay, this is gonna be tougher
than I thought.

43:35.798 --> 43:37.197
Wanna hear a secret?

45:02.151 --> 45:05.780
You've got possibilities, little man.

45:08.691 --> 45:11.216
But, sadly,
I don't have time to play with you.

45:14.363 --> 45:16.058
Let's go.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.880
- Take this to Owlman.
- Yes, mistress.

45:34.049 --> 45:35.209
What about him?

45:37.453 --> 45:40.889
Oh, I'm sure I'll think of something.

45:41.423 --> 45:44.824
ROSE: We're all here for the same reason.
We're tired.

45:44.994 --> 45:46.723
Tired of living in fear.

45:46.895 --> 45:50.661
Tired of our elected officials
bending over for vicious criminals.

45:52.568 --> 45:54.536
It doesn't have to be that way.

45:54.703 --> 45:58.366
Joining me today are elected officials
who aren't afraid to act.

45:58.540 --> 46:01.270
Judges, prosecutors, police officers...

46:01.443 --> 46:03.911
...and brave people
like each and every one of you.

46:05.614 --> 46:08.014
Together we can win. Together we--

46:10.452 --> 46:11.476
Excuse me.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.761
No. Stay away from me.

46:49.324 --> 46:50.951
How Long have you been watching me?

46:51.126 --> 46:54.721
My apologies for the deception.
I doubt this will be the Last attempt.

46:54.897 --> 46:58.230
With your permission,
I'll continue to keep close watch on you...

46:58.400 --> 47:00.561
...until the immediate crisis has passed.

47:01.170 --> 47:03.297
That would be Just fine.

47:13.715 --> 47:17.913
Nice moves.
You remind me of my boyfriend.

47:21.423 --> 47:24.153
Whatever will I do with you?

47:25.661 --> 47:28.494
I could use this to send you away.

47:28.997 --> 47:30.123
Perhaps to here...

47:30.299 --> 47:35.100
...an Earth where humanity has mutated
into hideous creatures of the night.

47:35.637 --> 47:37.935
No. You might like that.

47:38.107 --> 47:39.768
Oh. Here's a good one.

47:40.275 --> 47:44.302
A cold, uninhabited Earth,
where you'll slowly starve to death...

47:45.047 --> 47:47.038
...if you don't freeze first.

47:47.683 --> 47:49.651
Or it might be fun to keep you as a pet.

47:52.521 --> 47:55.046
Here. Let me do that.

47:57.826 --> 48:00.158
- Your call.
- Sorry.

48:00.329 --> 48:01.626
You're not my type.

48:04.933 --> 48:07.493
That's going to cost you a rib.

48:09.705 --> 48:11.366
Aah! Ow!

48:14.943 --> 48:17.468
I like my lovers to make a little noise.

48:17.646 --> 48:18.738
What else can I break?

48:24.453 --> 48:28.719
You think you can hide from me
with a smoke bomb?

48:34.129 --> 48:35.357
BATMAN:
It's not smoke.

48:39.034 --> 48:41.559
It's anaesthetic gas.

48:55.384 --> 48:58.148
Batman to Justice League.

49:05.226 --> 49:06.591
Aah.

49:10.264 --> 49:11.788
You sure that will hold her?

49:13.167 --> 49:16.694
- What did you hide on my satellite?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

49:19.941 --> 49:22.136
What was so valuable
that the Crime Syndicate...

49:22.310 --> 49:24.005
...would cross dimensions to get it?

49:24.178 --> 49:26.806
- Did you keep it from her?
- Her henchman escaped with it.

49:26.981 --> 49:28.539
Whatever it was.

49:28.716 --> 49:32.049
It's the quantum trigger,
the detonator for a bomb they're building.

49:32.220 --> 49:34.780
Without it, we could fight them,
but now--

49:34.956 --> 49:36.446
Why didn't you Just destroy it?

49:36.624 --> 49:39.218
It's pure energy. It can't be destroyed.

49:40.027 --> 49:41.221
Okay. They've got it.

49:41.396 --> 49:42.863
What's the worst-case scenario?

49:43.030 --> 49:47.467
LEX: They could use it to set off an explosion
that would wipe out the entire Earth.

49:51.506 --> 49:54.236
You think too small.

49:58.946 --> 50:00.072
Where's Superwoman?

50:00.248 --> 50:02.648
Probably Just blowing us off.
Like I should have.

50:02.817 --> 50:05.411
We're not waiting anymore.
Let's get started.

50:05.586 --> 50:07.781
People aren't as intimidated
as they used to be.

50:07.955 --> 50:10.651
I should go down for a Jog
and terrorize the straights.

50:10.825 --> 50:13.692
Even regular law enforcement's
starting to show some backbone.

50:13.861 --> 50:15.328
Archer got himself arrested.

50:15.496 --> 50:18.397
Public opinion wouldn't be an issue
if the bomb were ready.

50:18.566 --> 50:21.228
The QED is nearly complete.

50:21.402 --> 50:23.267
I have agents out
gathering some equipment.

50:25.306 --> 50:27.365
Sorry, sorry to come in
without permission...

50:27.542 --> 50:30.568
...but Superwoman said
to bring this right to you.

50:38.786 --> 50:41.949
You don't have to wear that disguise.
No one can see in here.

50:42.123 --> 50:44.182
I thought it would make you
more comfortable.

50:44.358 --> 50:47.020
Just the opposite.
I'd like to get to know the real you.

50:51.399 --> 50:52.832
That's better.

50:53.034 --> 50:55.867
- Are you really from Mars?
- Yes.

50:56.037 --> 50:58.164
And can all Martians read minds?

50:58.840 --> 51:00.967
Could. I am the Last survivor.

51:03.811 --> 51:05.802
I apologize for reading your mind before.

51:05.980 --> 51:09.143
It is considered extremely impolite to do so
without permission.

51:09.317 --> 51:13.481
I didn't mind.
It seemed, I don't know, natural.

51:14.288 --> 51:15.346
We are attuned.

51:17.658 --> 51:22.186
Our minds are in sync to a degree
that was rare even among my own people.

51:22.363 --> 51:25.855
I never imagined I'd meet a human
so complimentary to myself.

51:26.501 --> 51:29.470
I feel it, attuned.

51:29.637 --> 51:31.229
What are you doing?

51:31.973 --> 51:33.600
Trying to kiss you.

51:33.774 --> 51:36.971
On Earth, it's a way of sharing affection.

51:38.613 --> 51:40.581
This is how we do it on Mars.

51:48.789 --> 51:50.313
Know me.

52:37.572 --> 52:40.268
That was.... Wow.

52:40.441 --> 52:43.706
Now we know each other.

52:46.147 --> 52:48.547
All the battles the Justice League
have won.

52:48.716 --> 52:50.684
You think you can beat
the Crime Syndicate?

52:50.851 --> 52:53.411
If we could find them, I have little doubt.

52:53.588 --> 52:57.615
I could find out where their base is.
My father's known for years.

53:25.586 --> 53:26.985
You wanna give us a hand here?

53:27.154 --> 53:29.782
Final calculations. Very delicate.

53:43.804 --> 53:45.135
FLASH:
Are we there yet?

53:45.306 --> 53:48.139
That wasn't funny the first 15 times
you said it, either.

53:48.309 --> 53:50.243
Enjoy yourselves while you can.

53:50.411 --> 53:54.347
- My friends are going to tear you apart.
- Told you we should have Left her.

53:54.515 --> 53:57.643
We couldn't take the chance she'd escape
and warn them we're coming.

53:57.818 --> 54:02.152
When I get loose,
I'm killing you right after Batman. Uhn!

54:02.323 --> 54:05.053
Doesn't mean we have to listen to her,
though.

54:10.898 --> 54:12.923
How are we supposed to get in again?

54:13.100 --> 54:15.898
Multi-frequency band,
encryption analyser-replicator pack.

54:16.070 --> 54:18.004
Some of us don't speak Star Trek.

54:18.172 --> 54:20.902
Think of it
as a fancy garage-door opener.

54:27.481 --> 54:29.711
Come on, then.
Pitch in, you miserable git.

54:31.318 --> 54:34.014
JOHNNY QUICK:
Having a kip, are we? I'm talking to you.

54:34.555 --> 54:36.546
The hangar doors Just opened.

54:44.832 --> 54:48.131
Is it Just me,
or does this seem a little too easy?

55:11.859 --> 55:13.884
We were Just about to come
Looking for you.

55:14.061 --> 55:17.394
The QED is armed now.
You'll want to surrender.

55:17.565 --> 55:19.499
ULTRAMAN:
You heard him. We've got the bomb.

55:19.667 --> 55:22.295
Everybody does what we say, or else.

55:22.470 --> 55:23.494
You're bluffing.

55:23.671 --> 55:26.731
As Long as the bomb's here,
all you can blow up is your own house.

55:26.907 --> 55:29.933
Maybe you should surrender.
We've taken down dozens of you.

55:30.111 --> 55:32.272
And now the odds are 6-to-3.

55:32.446 --> 55:35.006
SUPERWOMAN: Count again.
- Uhn! Uhn!

55:35.182 --> 55:36.649
Look who I found in the hangar.

57:29.997 --> 57:31.089
Submit.

57:48.649 --> 57:50.241
Bugger.

59:31.685 --> 59:32.709
No.

59:40.928 --> 59:44.329
- What Just happened?
- He's taken the QED to Earth Prime.

59:44.498 --> 59:47.331
If he detonates it, he'll destroy all reality.

59:47.735 --> 59:50.431
- I'm not liking the sound of that.
- Don't listen to him.

59:50.604 --> 59:52.834
Owlman's Just taking the bomb
to a hiding place.

59:53.007 --> 59:55.874
Don't try and con me.
What are you two doing?

59:57.277 --> 59:58.608
LEX:
There's no way to follow him.

59:58.779 --> 01:00:00.872
- It's over.
- Not yet.

01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:03.715
How many coordinates
does this thing keep in memory?

01:00:03.884 --> 01:00:05.283
The Last dozen or so, but--

01:00:05.452 --> 01:00:07.113
That's more than enough.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:22.234
Owlman's way ahead of us.
We're locked out.

01:00:22.403 --> 01:00:23.870
Unless....

01:00:24.038 --> 01:00:26.563
Someone vibrating at the right speed
could piggyback...

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.709
...on Owlman's carrier wave
and open a portal.

01:00:29.877 --> 01:00:31.742
But he'd have to be fast.

01:00:31.912 --> 01:00:34.779
- I'm your man.
- No, you're not. You're too slow.

01:00:34.948 --> 01:00:36.711
- What?
- I know your limitations.

01:00:36.884 --> 01:00:40.320
You can't possibly reach the speed
necessary to pull this off.

01:00:40.487 --> 01:00:42.148
- But I can.
- Listen.

01:00:42.322 --> 01:00:43.346
- I--
- No, you listen.

01:00:43.524 --> 01:00:46.220
He's talking about my world.
I'm not letting that happen.

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:49.362
- It could be dangerous--
- The bloody universe is at stake.

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:50.963
Of course it's dangerous.

01:00:51.131 --> 01:00:55.363
All right, when you reach the proper speed,
I'll give you a mark.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.314
LEX: You have to hold that speed precisely.
Got it?

01:01:15.989 --> 01:01:17.923
Faster.

01:01:18.392 --> 01:01:20.121
Faster.

01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:53.252
Hold that speed.

01:02:05.739 --> 01:02:07.331
I'm next.

01:02:07.508 --> 01:02:11.535
You don't have a transit device.
You'd be torn apart by the event horizon.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.494
OWLMAN:
Welcome to Earth Prime.

01:02:36.103 --> 01:02:38.867
Before there was thought,
there was this place.

01:02:39.039 --> 01:02:41.337
One Earth, with a single history.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.409
But with the coming of man
came the illusion of free will...

01:02:45.312 --> 01:02:48.110
...and with that illusion came chaos.

01:02:48.282 --> 01:02:51.945
With every choice we make,
we literally create a world.

01:02:52.753 --> 01:02:57.087
History branches in two, creating one Earth
where we made the choice...

01:02:57.257 --> 01:02:59.122
...and a second where we didn't.

01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:01.924
That's the secret of the universe,
you know.

01:03:02.095 --> 01:03:05.064
Billions of people
making billions of choices...

01:03:05.499 --> 01:03:07.524
...creating infinite Earth's.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:10.329
Some so similar to each other
you can spend a lifetime...

01:03:10.504 --> 01:03:13.564
...searching for any distinction,
others so radically different...

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.298
...they defy comprehension.

01:03:15.475 --> 01:03:17.705
And all of the branches originate here.

01:03:18.111 --> 01:03:23.879
Every version of reality balances
precariously on this singular Earth.

01:03:24.651 --> 01:03:27.119
It seems so different
from the Earth's we know.

01:03:27.287 --> 01:03:32.350
I can't imagine what series of decisions
led to this world hurtling out of its orbit.

01:03:32.526 --> 01:03:33.686
But I know this:

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.954
The source of the cataclysm
was the same as it always is.

01:03:37.698 --> 01:03:38.960
Man.

01:03:39.132 --> 01:03:40.622
You can't be sure of that.

01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:42.234
- Anything--
- You know better.

01:03:42.703 --> 01:03:44.102
Man is a cancer.

01:03:44.271 --> 01:03:46.466
And I've chosen to cut out the disease.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.164
You're talking about killing--

01:03:48.342 --> 01:03:51.277
Everyone who ever lived.
Who ever will live.

01:03:53.113 --> 01:03:56.742
I choose to make
the only possible real choice.

01:04:00.988 --> 01:04:02.182
You're insane.

01:04:02.356 --> 01:04:03.618
Does it really matter?

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:07.851
There are alternate versions of me
that you would find quite charming.

01:04:28.882 --> 01:04:31.544
OWLMAN: From what I gather,
we're very much alike.

01:04:31.718 --> 01:04:33.845
Everything about you tells the tale.

01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:37.548
Your attitude, your costume,
your tactics...

01:04:37.991 --> 01:04:43.156
...they all scream of outrage,
despair, vengeance.

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:47.699
What terrible wrong was done
to set you on this path?

01:04:50.003 --> 01:04:51.800
It doesn't really matter.

01:04:52.406 --> 01:04:54.067
Nothing matters.

01:04:54.574 --> 01:04:57.907
What are you planning to do,
talk me to death?

01:04:58.445 --> 01:04:59.742
Actually....

01:05:04.584 --> 01:05:06.518
I thought I'd beat you to death.

01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:37.950
You should have sent your flying man.

01:05:38.952 --> 01:05:41.045
With his strength,
he might have had a chance.

01:05:41.221 --> 01:05:44.281
But you don't trust anyone else
to do what needs to be done.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.157
Hah. I feel the same way.

01:05:48.328 --> 01:05:53.027
If we're really alike,
you know this is wrong.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.234
You must have been a good man, once.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:58.463
No. Not good.

01:05:58.638 --> 01:06:02.938
Never good. After all, I'm only human.

01:06:21.995 --> 01:06:24.759
- Uhn!
- No more debate.

01:06:25.165 --> 01:06:28.498
I'm going to kill you now,
then everyone else.

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:35.268
There is a difference
between you and me.

01:06:42.516 --> 01:06:44.780
We both looked into the abyss...

01:06:46.987 --> 01:06:49.649
...but when it Looked back at us...

01:06:50.056 --> 01:06:52.149
...you blinked.

01:07:19.186 --> 01:07:20.949
It doesn't matter.

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:52.475
Are you all right?

01:07:53.286 --> 01:07:55.652
Johnny, I'm back. Stop vibrating.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:57.517
Stop.

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:03.523
Oh, God.

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:19.276
Did we save the world, then?

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.711
We did.

01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:27.380
And all that rubbish about me
being faster than Flash?

01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:30.354
You knew this was gonna happen.

01:08:35.495 --> 01:08:37.587
Good one, mate.

01:08:50.243 --> 01:08:53.542
That's real sad, ain't it?
Now, get your asses off my moon.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:54.975
What's wrong with you?

01:08:55.148 --> 01:08:57.048
We almost Lost everything.

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.377
That was then.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.453
Now you're a bunch of wanna be cops
trying to take me in.

01:09:01.621 --> 01:09:03.282
Going to take you in.

01:09:03.456 --> 01:09:09.053
Two things: You ain't got the authority
and you ain't nearly tough enough.

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:13.028
We're more than tough enough.

01:09:13.198 --> 01:09:14.426
Brought the cavalry?

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.796
I brought the Marines.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:36.915
The president was displeased
by the attempt on his daughter's life.

01:09:37.323 --> 01:09:39.417
There are nuclear weapons in the shuttle.

01:09:39.826 --> 01:09:41.453
I brought enough for everybody.

01:10:02.582 --> 01:10:05.813
WILSON: There's no way to thank you.
You've given us back our world.

01:10:05.986 --> 01:10:09.683
I've already ordered the national guard
to support local Law-enforcement teams.

01:10:10.156 --> 01:10:13.216
We're rounding up the bad guys
everywhere.

01:10:16.363 --> 01:10:17.660
I don't want you to go.

01:10:17.831 --> 01:10:21.597
I don't want to go either,
but I don't belong here.

01:10:21.768 --> 01:10:25.465
You could.
You could belong here with me.

01:10:26.106 --> 01:10:29.803
Excuse me, J'onn,
but would you stop acting like an idiot?

01:10:30.243 --> 01:10:33.144
- What?
- This is what we fight for.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:36.441
If you love her, stay.

01:10:42.555 --> 01:10:44.420
I've already Lost one home.

01:10:44.591 --> 01:10:48.220
I made a promise to protect my new one.

01:10:49.062 --> 01:10:52.156
Then this is how we say goodbye.

01:10:59.406 --> 01:11:01.897
Maybe there's another one like her
back on our Earth.

01:11:02.075 --> 01:11:05.010
With my luck, she'll be evil.

01:11:24.964 --> 01:11:27.296
Ah. It's good to be back home.

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.528
- Ow!
- Mind your head.

01:11:29.703 --> 01:11:31.762
FLASH:
I can't believe you kept that thing.

01:11:31.938 --> 01:11:34.031
Spoils of war. I like it.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:36.607
What do you need a plane for, anyway?
You can fly.

01:11:36.776 --> 01:11:38.437
You drive a car.

01:11:38.611 --> 01:11:40.306
That is so not the point.

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:44.714
I owe you an apology about this mission.
You were right.

01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:46.317
We were both right.

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.153
Still, more help around here
wouldn't be a bad idea.

01:11:50.523 --> 01:11:51.956
I'm glad you agree.

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:54.491
I've been thinking
about a membership drive.
