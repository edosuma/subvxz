ONE WEEK AGO.

16:57.200 --> 17:01.570
IT IMBUED HIM WITH THE POWER
TO PHASE TIME,

17:01.640 --> 17:05.010
ENABLING HIM TO LEAP
MOMENTS AHEAD OF THE REST OF US.

17:05.070 --> 17:06.210
THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN

17:06.280 --> 17:09.010
WHY HE STOLE
THE TROLBOT 9000.

17:09.080 --> 17:12.450
ARTHUR'S QUITE
A GENIUS HIMSELF.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.520
HE SPENT YEARS
DESIGNING A WEAPON

17:14.580 --> 17:17.620
EXACTLY LIKE
THE TROLBOT 9000.

17:17.690 --> 17:22.090
WHEN HE LEARNED THE MILITARY
DEVELOPED A BIGGER, MEANER BOT,

17:22.160 --> 17:24.130
HE--HE TOOK IT HARD.

17:24.190 --> 17:28.600
HE SET OUT TO ACQUIRE
WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE HIS.

17:28.660 --> 17:32.170
AND THAT'S WHY
I WAS CALLING!

17:32.240 --> 17:34.240
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT!

17:34.300 --> 17:36.310
NEXT TIME,
I'LL TAKE A MESSAGE.

17:36.370 --> 17:38.840
I'M A SUPER HERO,
NOT A SECRETARY.

17:38.910 --> 17:41.080
IN ORDER TO DEFEAT
MY GRANDSON,

17:41.140 --> 17:43.950
WE HAVE TO SET A TIME TRAP.

17:44.010 --> 17:46.150
YOU CAN SHOW US
WHAT HE'S GONNA DO?

17:46.220 --> 17:48.780
OF COURSE. OBSERVE.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.350
TIME OUT, LOONATICS.

17:50.420 --> 17:53.020
Chroniker: NOW WATCH
AS HE FREEZES TIME

17:53.090 --> 17:55.820
AND GETS PAST
YOU AND THE SECURITY,

17:55.890 --> 17:58.230
ALLOWING HIM TO ENTER
THE TROLBOT UNDETECTED.

17:58.290 --> 18:01.360
ONCE INSIDE...
HE'S UNSTOPPABLE.

18:01.430 --> 18:04.530
LET'S TAKE A TOUR
OF THE CITY!

18:07.470 --> 18:11.240
Duck: WAIT.
THIS LOOKS FAMILIAR.

18:11.310 --> 18:16.210
Ace: RIGHT. WE CHASE THE BOT,
AND HE BEATS US.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.980
HEY, CAN THIS
CONTRAPTION

18:18.050 --> 18:19.620
SEND THINGS
BACK THROUGH TIME?

18:19.680 --> 18:21.380
YES, OF COURSE.

18:21.450 --> 18:23.620
HMM. LET'S GET
A HEAD START.

18:23.690 --> 18:26.160
Tech: DR. CHRONIKER,
REWIND THE CLOCK.

18:26.220 --> 18:30.790
Ace: SO WE CAN UNDO
THE DEJA VU.

18:51.910 --> 18:54.920
[YAWNS] BREAKFAST?

18:54.980 --> 19:01.060
APPARENTLY, YOU HAD ME SEND
THIS TO YOU FROM LATER TODAY.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.130
I HAD YOU SEND ME
WHAT FROM WHEN?

19:03.190 --> 19:06.330
OH. AND ALSO THESE PLANS FOR
DR. CHRONIKER'S TIME DISPLACER.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.460
I HAD YOU SEND US
WHAT FROM WHO?

19:08.530 --> 19:12.070
OH, PLEASE. NOTES SENT
FROM LATER TODAY?

19:12.130 --> 19:13.570
RIDICULOUS!

19:13.640 --> 19:14.900
ZODAVIA'LL STRAIGHTEN
THIS OUT WHEN SHE CALLS

19:14.970 --> 19:16.510
IN THE NEXT FEW SECONDS--

19:16.570 --> 19:19.070
[GASPS]

19:19.140 --> 19:21.410
HUH?

19:21.480 --> 19:24.510
LOONATICS, YOUR ASSISTANCE
IS URGENTLY NEEDED

19:24.580 --> 19:26.180
AT THE ACMETROPOLIS
MILITARY WEAPONS LAB.

19:26.250 --> 19:29.120
SOMEONE'S BROKEN IN
AND IS TRYING TO STEAL--

19:29.180 --> 19:32.320
THE TROLBOT 9000.
HOW DO I KNOW THIS AGAIN?

19:32.390 --> 19:34.320
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL
REMEMBERING SHADOWS

19:34.390 --> 19:36.960
OF THE FUTURE--
MENTAL FLASH-FORWARDS.

19:37.030 --> 19:40.630
WE'RE MOVING IN TIME THROUGH
A DAY THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.470
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT TODAY.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.600
YOU THINKIN'
WHAT I'M THINKIN'?

19:45.670 --> 19:47.870
I WAS ALREADY
THINKING IT YESTERDAY.

19:47.940 --> 19:51.140
LISTEN UP. SOME OF THIS
MIGHT NOT MAKE ANY SENSE...

19:51.210 --> 19:52.510
LIKE IT EVER DOES.

19:52.580 --> 19:55.510
BUT HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

19:57.180 --> 20:01.580
THIS'LL BE A PIECE OF CAKE.
NO SECURITY ALARMS.

20:03.990 --> 20:05.750
NOBODY HOME?

20:05.820 --> 20:06.890
WEIRD.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.420
NOT THAT I MIND.

20:08.490 --> 20:10.890
HA HA HA HA HA!

20:18.300 --> 20:22.100
DON'T WORRY. I'LL SOON
NEUTRALIZE YOUR POWERS.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.170
YOU CAN'T DO THIS
TO ME!

20:24.240 --> 20:26.170
I CAN...AND I WILL.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.040
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

20:28.110 --> 20:30.780
[SIRENS APPROACH]

20:30.850 --> 20:33.250
NO!

20:33.320 --> 20:35.950
Duck: BON VOYAGE.
SEE YA LAST WEEK.

20:36.020 --> 20:38.150
[Time Skip yelling]

20:38.220 --> 20:40.560
NOOOO!

20:42.330 --> 20:45.490
AND I THOUGHT THIS DAY
WOULD NEVER END.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.700
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.
