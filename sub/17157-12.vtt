WEBVTT

00:08.567 --> 00:12.067
- Wow,
our first real sound check.

00:12.067 --> 00:13.400
This is huge.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.100
- Not as huge as when we rock it
tomorrow

00:15.100 --> 00:16.167
at Battle of the Bands.

00:16.167 --> 00:17.733
all: Yeah!

00:17.733 --> 00:20.833
- That's cool too,
but I really love sound checks.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.333
- Think we'll win?

00:22.333 --> 00:24.367
- After we killed it
at the auditions,

00:24.367 --> 00:27.000
we're walking in here
as the band to beat.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.033
all: Yeah!

00:29.033 --> 00:30.300
- Well, well, well.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.133
If it isn't Preschool of Rock.

00:34.767 --> 00:37.033
- Hello, Justin.
How's Night Lizard?

00:37.033 --> 00:41.300
- Or should we say
Night...Gizzard?

00:41.300 --> 00:43.467
- Do you even know
what a gizzard is?

00:43.467 --> 00:44.400
- No. You?

00:44.400 --> 00:45.767
- I asked you first.

00:45.767 --> 00:47.267
I win...

00:47.267 --> 00:49.500
just like we're gonna win
Battle of the Bands,

00:49.500 --> 00:51.500
because we're a real band

00:51.500 --> 00:54.467
and you're a bunch of babies.

00:54.467 --> 00:55.633
- Babies?

00:55.633 --> 00:58.467
Well, say hello
to Goo-goo and Ga-ga.

00:58.467 --> 01:02.500
- Bring it. I've picked
boogers bigger than you.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.100
- Okay, those guys
are the worst,

01:06.100 --> 01:07.433
but everyone else in this club

01:07.433 --> 01:09.567
is gonna give us the respect
we deserve.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.367
- Yeah.
- Hey, Dewey.

01:11.367 --> 01:14.267
Your baby band
want my keys to play with?

01:14.267 --> 01:17.633
Does the wittle guy
wanna wook at the keys?

01:17.633 --> 01:19.433
- No one cares
about your keys.

01:19.433 --> 01:21.133
- I hope you remember our bet,
Dewey.

01:21.967 --> 01:23.233
- Oh, I remembered.

01:23.233 --> 01:24.767
What did I bet?

01:24.767 --> 01:27.433
- You bet your van that we'd win
Battle of the Bands.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.700
- That's fine. I'm a rocker.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.633
All I need in this life
is my guitar.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.200
- You also bet your guitar.
- I'm so stupid.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.467
- Hey, uh,
isn't it time for your nap?

01:37.467 --> 01:40.133
Here's a beddy-bye story
for you.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.633
You're gonna lose.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.567
The end.

01:43.567 --> 01:45.133
- You're the one
who's going to lose,

01:45.133 --> 01:47.433
because we've got a killer song.

01:47.433 --> 01:49.067
- And we're gonna rock it,

01:49.067 --> 01:51.600
because we practice
all the time.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.067
- Every day, yo.

01:53.067 --> 01:56.200
- In Room 21A
at William B. Travis Prep,

01:56.200 --> 01:57.600
which is our classroom,

01:57.600 --> 01:59.433
but we've turned it
into rehearsal space

01:59.433 --> 02:01.800
with an elaborate system for
hiding our instruments.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.833
Boom.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.767
- We're in a sound check
right now.

02:05.767 --> 02:08.833
You'll see.
We're not little kids.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.700
Someone give me a boost.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.200
- I'm your man.

02:21.867 --> 02:23.800
- Whoa. Where we going?

02:23.800 --> 02:26.733
[crashing]

02:29.967 --> 02:32.767
- Someone call my pediatrician.

02:32.767 --> 02:35.067
I mean grown-up doctor.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.733
[upbeat rock music]

02:36.733 --> 02:39.167
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

02:39.167 --> 02:41.400
* It all adds up
to one thing *

02:41.400 --> 02:43.067
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.633
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

02:45.633 --> 02:48.267
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

02:48.267 --> 02:50.900
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

02:50.900 --> 02:52.533
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

02:52.533 --> 02:54.067
*

02:54.067 --> 02:56.333
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

02:56.333 --> 02:59.067
* There's an answer
right in front of you *

02:59.067 --> 03:01.800
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

03:01.800 --> 03:03.500
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

03:03.500 --> 03:05.767
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

03:11.300 --> 03:12.800
- All right, there's the band

03:12.800 --> 03:15.067
that's gonna take home
the trophy tonight.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.067
kids: Yeah.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.300
- Tomika, you pumped?

03:17.300 --> 03:18.633
- [in croaky voice] Yeah.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.133
- Whoa, your throat
sounds terrible.

03:21.133 --> 03:22.433
Does it hurt?

03:22.433 --> 03:24.300
- I feel like a swallowed
a flip-flop.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.067
I may be coming down
with something.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.933
- This is serious.
We need your voice tonight.

03:28.933 --> 03:32.433
Good thing I always carry
my rock-and-roll first aid kit.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.867
Stage dive bandages,

03:35.867 --> 03:39.333
emergency drumstick
eye-poke patch, breath mint.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.200
Not a breath mint.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.367
Here we go.

03:42.367 --> 03:44.067
Take a slug of this.

03:46.233 --> 03:48.900
- Ugh, what is this?

03:48.900 --> 03:50.633
Liquid worm guts?

03:50.633 --> 03:52.667
- Tomika, don't be disgusting.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.600
It's fish tank algae.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.800
Beyoncé swears by it.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.167
- It says,
"Not for human consumption."

04:02.167 --> 04:04.133
- Beyoncé's not a human.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.067
She's a god.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.667
I'll make you a deal.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.100
Just take a swig,

04:09.100 --> 04:12.367
and you can have this lollipop
to wash it down.

04:12.367 --> 04:15.333
- Or I'll just take
the lollipop.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.067
Good day, sir.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.433
- Did you guys see this?

04:19.433 --> 04:21.567
We're not even on the Battle
of the Bands website.

04:21.567 --> 04:25.800
Night Lizard, Black Box,
The Flying Armageda Brothers.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.500
- There we are, "And others."

04:27.500 --> 04:29.467
That's us.

04:29.467 --> 04:31.700
- And every other band
has a cool bio page.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.067
All we have is a picture
of Mr. Finn eating a hot dog.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.267
- Ah, am I standing
next to a Porta-Potty?

04:36.267 --> 04:39.167
- Yeah.
- That's a good pic.

04:39.167 --> 04:41.867
- Mr. Finn, we're not getting
the respect we deserve.

04:41.867 --> 04:43.967
They're treating us like
a bunch of little kids.

04:43.967 --> 04:46.800
- It doesn't matter what
other people think of us now.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.500
When we're on that stage
tonight,

04:48.500 --> 04:50.600
everyone will take us seriously.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.500
All right, we have
science lab this afternoon,

04:53.500 --> 04:55.400
so let's get in
one last rehearsal.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.400
- Yeah.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.800
[music playing]

04:57.800 --> 05:00.067
- Cool lick.
Is that "Shut Up and Dance?"

05:00.067 --> 05:02.267
- Yeah, but I recorded
myself playing it

05:02.267 --> 05:03.467
and sped up the tempo.

05:03.467 --> 05:05.100
- Nice.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.967
[music playing]

05:08.967 --> 05:10.100
- Hello?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.967
- Hey, Zack.
It's me, Lawrence.

05:11.967 --> 05:15.933
I'm just calling to tell you
how awesome your ring tone is.

05:15.933 --> 05:16.767
- Thanks, man.

05:16.767 --> 05:18.700
- So how's life?

05:18.700 --> 05:21.067
- Okay, I got to go.

05:21.067 --> 05:24.200
- All right, guys, let's really
concentrate on our song.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.600
It's our secret weapon.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.367
Night Lizard won't know
what hit 'em.

05:27.367 --> 05:28.433
- Yeah.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.300
- One, two, three, four!

05:30.300 --> 05:33.300
[lively rock music]

05:35.067 --> 05:37.800

05:37.800 --> 05:40.600
* Blink and then
it's all gone, so long *

05:40.600 --> 05:45.100
* Let me hear you say,
"Whoa, the time is now" *

05:45.100 --> 05:48.567
- Enjoy it while it lasts,
Uncool of Rock.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.133
Ha ha!

05:50.133 --> 05:51.767
- * Don't want to find out
it's too late *

05:51.767 --> 05:53.133
* Let me hear you say...

05:55.133 --> 05:56.800
- Can we leave yet?

05:56.800 --> 05:58.933
I mean, school's over, and the
other kids have gone ahead.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.833
We can't be late
for Battle of the Bands.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.667
- We have to follow my plan
to sneak out.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.267
If people see us
with our instruments,

06:04.267 --> 06:06.067
they'll know
we're a secret band.

06:06.067 --> 06:08.367
Lawrence, hall monitor status.

06:08.367 --> 06:11.600
- Clark's finishing his
ceremonial folding of the vest.

06:14.267 --> 06:19.067
We get it, Clark.
You take your job seriously.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.667
He's off duty. We're clear.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.967
- Great. It's go time, people.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.467
[gasps]

06:27.467 --> 06:28.833
The track team
is heading this way.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.500
Why are they coming inside?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.500
- It says they're
repaving the track,

06:33.500 --> 06:34.967
so practice is inside.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.633
- Freddy, you were
supposed to make sure

06:38.633 --> 06:40.333
there were no activities
in the halls.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.900
- I thought I did,

06:41.900 --> 06:43.567
but I must have gotten
distracted by life problems.

06:43.567 --> 06:45.467
- I'm sorry if you're going
through a rough time.

06:45.467 --> 06:48.233
- No, it's a game on my phone
called Life Problems.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.800
I have to get the money
to send my twins to college,

06:50.800 --> 06:52.133
or my ex-wife is gonna sue me.

06:52.133 --> 06:56.067
- I'm on my way.
- Principal Mullins!

07:01.667 --> 07:03.200
- Oh, Principal Mullins!

07:03.200 --> 07:04.900
Did you get your hair...
something?

07:04.900 --> 07:06.833
- Okay, I don't have time
for chitchat.

07:06.833 --> 07:08.700
The sprinklers outside
are all going haywire.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.167
So if you don't mind,

07:10.167 --> 07:12.067
I'll be out back
bailing out the soccer field.

07:12.067 --> 07:14.700
You want to know why?
Because I'm an educator.

- Hold on!
- [gasps]

07:27.667 --> 07:29.800
- Go, team!

07:29.800 --> 07:30.967
- They're too unpredictable.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.067
We'll never get out of here.

07:32.067 --> 07:33.567
- I got us into this mess.

07:33.567 --> 07:35.567
I'll get us out of it.

Okay, Lions.

art room has to do push-ups.

07:42.467 --> 07:43.733
Let's go.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.233
- We have to move. Go, go, go.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.067
- I've got them doing
wind sprints in the library.

07:53.067 --> 07:56.133
Also, no idea how I ended up
at the top of the stairs.

08:00.233 --> 08:01.933
- I can't believe you guys
made me pull you

08:01.933 --> 08:03.767
out of the sprinklers!

08:03.767 --> 08:04.900
- Sorry, Mr. Finn.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.267
It's one of my life rules.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.300
If there's a sprinkler,
I run through it.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.300
- Tomika,
you should rest your voice.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.267
We have to keep you
from getting sick.

08:13.267 --> 08:14.367

08:15.900 --> 08:19.733
- "Er."
"Sicker."

08:19.733 --> 08:22.567
- Guys, the important thing
is, we're all together,

08:22.567 --> 08:24.700
and we're on our way
to Battle of the Bands!

08:24.700 --> 08:26.333
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

08:26.333 --> 08:27.367
[music playing]

08:27.367 --> 08:29.267

08:34.367 --> 08:36.967
Lawrence?
- Zack. I'm still in here.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.967
Is it safe to come out yet?

08:38.967 --> 08:40.833
- Turn the van around!

08:47.100 --> 08:47.900
[tires screech]

08:47.900 --> 08:49.100
- Here I come!

08:49.100 --> 08:50.933
Ooh, sprinklers.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.067
- We did it!

08:58.067 --> 08:59.500
We made it
to Battle of the Bands!

08:59.500 --> 09:00.600
And you know why?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.767
Because we're rockers.

09:02.767 --> 09:04.367
When we put our minds
to something,

09:04.367 --> 09:06.333
nothing gets in our way.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.833
Uh, dude,
you're kind of in our way.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.400
- We have a dress code.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.467
No wet clothes allowed.

09:12.467 --> 09:14.967
- Sir, I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.400
Our clothes aren't wet.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.467
- [retching]

09:27.067 --> 09:28.700
- That was disgusting.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.400
But I think I made my point.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.633
- What are we going to do?

09:32.633 --> 09:34.300
Battle of the Bands
is about to start,

09:34.300 --> 09:36.400
and we don't have time
to go home and get dry clothes.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.367
- There's a store
across the street.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.067
- Ow! My thumb.

09:41.067 --> 09:46.267
- Aw, the poor wittle baby
hurt his wittle thumb.

09:46.267 --> 09:48.433
- We are not babies.

09:54.467 --> 09:58.600
[laughter]

09:58.600 --> 10:02.433
- To be fair, we do
kind of look like babies.

10:02.433 --> 10:05.200
- Of all the stores,
it had to be Pajamarama.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.567
- Good thing
I had that gift card.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.900
- Could we look
any more pathetic?

10:09.900 --> 10:13.767
- Our first band up
is last year's winner,

10:13.767 --> 10:15.467
Night Lizard!

10:15.467 --> 10:18.667
[rock music playing
and crowd cheering]

10:18.667 --> 10:20.900
- Guys, I know things look bad,

10:20.900 --> 10:22.200
but we can't give up.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.800
I'm telling you,
it doesn't matter

10:23.800 --> 10:25.967
what these people think
of us now.

10:25.967 --> 10:28.133
The second they see us
on that stage,

10:28.133 --> 10:30.400
they'll know we've got something
they don't:

10:30.400 --> 10:31.767
a killer song!

10:31.767 --> 10:32.967
- Yeah.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.267
- * Whoa, our time is now

10:35.267 --> 10:37.100
- Why does this song sound
so familiar?

10:37.100 --> 10:39.633
- * 'Cause
you know tomorrow won't wait *

10:39.633 --> 10:41.867
* And I don't want to find out *

10:41.867 --> 10:43.867
- Because it's our song.

10:43.867 --> 10:46.400
They're stealing our song!

10:46.400 --> 10:47.700
- Nooo--

10:47.700 --> 10:49.700
- Don't worry. I got you.

10:49.700 --> 10:54.833
Ooooooooooooo!

10:57.800 --> 11:01.533
- * Our time is now

11:01.533 --> 11:03.633
[cheers and applause]

11:03.633 --> 11:06.133
- I can't believe
Night Lizard stole our song.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.367
- We lost Battle of the Bands

11:07.367 --> 11:09.367
before we even got a chance
to play.

11:09.367 --> 11:11.533
- The judges haven't given
their scores yet.

11:11.533 --> 11:13.433
We might still have hope.

11:13.433 --> 11:16.633
- Wow!
A nine, and nine, and a ten.

11:16.633 --> 11:20.667
That is going to be
almost impossible to beat.

11:20.667 --> 11:24.400
- I was probably wrong to put
so much weight on the scores.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.933
- What are we going to do?
Tomika's voice is gone.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.067
We don't have a singer.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.667
- We don't have a song either.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.067
- Yeah, if we sing our song now,

11:31.067 --> 11:32.700
it'll seem like we stole it
from Night Lizard.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.933
- I never should have bragged
about our song to them.

11:34.933 --> 11:37.733
- We all bragged,
like dumb little kids.

11:37.733 --> 11:39.267
- Everybody was right about us.

11:39.267 --> 11:41.133
We get distracted
by video games.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.600
- We run through sprinklers.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.067
- And then we have to wear
stupid ducky pajamas.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.833
Although I am coming around
on these.

11:46.833 --> 11:48.800
I just discovered the hood.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.267
[hood quacking]

11:53.433 --> 11:54.867
- [sighs]
Tomika's right.

11:54.867 --> 11:57.233
We should just give up
and go home.

11:57.233 --> 12:00.933
- How did you--
- I speak Tomika.

12:00.933 --> 12:04.133
- This is just not fair.

12:04.133 --> 12:07.333
You kids work harder
than all these other bands.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.133
Those guys don't have homework.

12:09.133 --> 12:10.533
- They don't have
to sneak out of school.

12:10.533 --> 12:12.100
- And they don't have
to work so hard

12:12.100 --> 12:13.567
to keep their band a secret.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.967
- Exactly.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.967
If only we could prove
to everybody that we rock

12:16.967 --> 12:18.800
and we deserve to be taken
serious--

12:18.800 --> 12:19.967
[hood quacking]

12:19.967 --> 12:22.667
- Sorry. But you're right.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.067
I say this isn't over.

12:24.067 --> 12:26.233
We can still blow the roof
off this joint!

12:26.233 --> 12:27.767
All we need is a plan.

12:27.767 --> 12:28.867
I've got one.

12:28.867 --> 12:31.100
Summer, think of a plan.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.433
- Me?
- Yeah.

12:32.433 --> 12:34.267
You're our manager for a reason.

12:34.267 --> 12:37.700
If there's a solution out there,
you'll find it.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.967
[music plays]

12:38.967 --> 12:40.267
- Sorry.
I'll put this on vibrate.

12:40.267 --> 12:41.800
I know it's getting annoying.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.833
- No, it's not getting annoying.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.133
That's our plan.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.067
- You're welcome, people.

12:50.967 --> 12:52.600
- Oh, Principal Mullins.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.800
A word, if I may.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.700
There's trouble afoot.

12:56.700 --> 12:57.733
- What is it this time?

12:57.733 --> 12:59.267
- Mr. Finn's class.

12:59.267 --> 13:02.833
They've taken off in his van
on an unauthorized trip.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.167
- Where would he take them?

13:04.167 --> 13:06.233
- Battle of the Bands.
It's today.

13:06.233 --> 13:07.800
- [sighs heavily]

13:07.800 --> 13:10.200
Well, I suppose I'll have
to skip my Funkercize spin class

13:10.200 --> 13:11.733
and look into this.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.733
- Right behind you, Chief.
I'll get my vest.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.933
- What are we doing on the roof
of the club?

13:17.933 --> 13:20.667
- This is where we're going
to rehearse our new song.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.833
- What new song?

13:21.833 --> 13:24.933
[music playing]

13:24.933 --> 13:27.200
- That song,
"Shut Up and Dance."

13:27.200 --> 13:29.067
We'll use Zack's guitar lick
as a start

13:29.067 --> 13:30.667
to make our own
killer version of it.

13:30.667 --> 13:34.067
But first we've got
to get our singer back.

13:34.067 --> 13:36.067
- Algae time.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.133
Let me shake it up first.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.533
All the sludge is at the bottom.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.667
- I know it's yucky, Tomiks,

13:48.667 --> 13:50.067
but we need you to do it.

13:50.067 --> 13:51.233
I'll drink some with you.

13:51.233 --> 13:53.500
Algae me, Mr. Finn.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.367
[sighs] Okay.

13:56.367 --> 13:59.767
One...two...

13:59.767 --> 14:01.367
three.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.167
- No fair.
You didn't drink yours!

14:07.167 --> 14:09.267
- It was disgusting!

14:09.267 --> 14:11.767
- My voice.

14:11.767 --> 14:15.133
Hey, I can complain again.

14:15.133 --> 14:17.133
- Which means you can sing.

14:17.133 --> 14:19.467
- I'm gonna stick
with complaining.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.533
- Lawrence, help me
put the clothes up to dry.

14:21.533 --> 14:22.833
- Sure.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.500
- Now all we have to do
is learn the song.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.900
- It took us months
to learn the last one.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.333
- We are better musicians now.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.233
We know each other's rhythms.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.800
We're a well-oiled machine.

14:34.233 --> 14:35.700
- This part of the machine

14:35.700 --> 14:39.567
just let someone's pants
fall off the building.

14:39.567 --> 14:40.833
- Oh, well.

14:40.833 --> 14:43.767
Freddy, give us a beat.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.300
[drum beating]
No, no.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.833
That's Walk the Moon's beat.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.700
I want the School of Rock beat.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.100
Zack, start your riff.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.067
[guitar music]

14:53.067 --> 14:55.567
Freddy, give us a beat
off of Zack.

14:55.567 --> 14:58.067
*

14:58.067 --> 15:01.733
Love it.
Tomika, lay down a bass.

15:01.733 --> 15:05.133
*

15:05.133 --> 15:07.967
Lawrence, put some frosting
on it.

15:07.967 --> 15:09.767
*

15:09.767 --> 15:11.200
Summer, bring it.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.200
*

15:15.200 --> 15:17.367
One, two, three, four!

15:17.367 --> 15:19.567
- * Is our destiny

15:19.567 --> 15:24.067
* He said, "Ooh, ooh,
shut up and dance with me *

15:24.067 --> 15:26.400
- This is even better
than the song we had before!

15:26.400 --> 15:27.933
- We might be able to win!

15:27.933 --> 15:31.767
- * Ooh, ooh,
shut up and dance with me *

15:31.767 --> 15:36.267
*

15:36.267 --> 15:39.400
[all cheer]

15:41.067 --> 15:42.833
- Lizards.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.267
- You can't steal this song.

15:44.267 --> 15:45.700
You already had your turn.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.533
- Actually,
we came to apologize.

15:48.533 --> 15:50.667
We feel bad about what we did.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.633
- Well, an apology is nice,
but, word to the wise,

15:53.633 --> 15:57.233
a greeting card along with it
really classes it up.

15:57.233 --> 15:58.767
- We thought about it,

15:58.767 --> 16:02.200
and we realized
you're not just a bunch of kids.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.700
- Aw, thanks, man.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.467
- You're a bunch of kids...

16:05.467 --> 16:06.767
locked on a roof!

16:09.900 --> 16:11.133
[song ends]

16:11.133 --> 16:15.667
[cheers and applause]

16:15.667 --> 16:18.233
- Let's hear it for Black Box!

16:18.233 --> 16:21.067
[cheers and applause]

16:21.067 --> 16:24.967
Next up, our very last band,

16:24.967 --> 16:26.833
School of Rock!

16:26.833 --> 16:28.267
[cheers and applause]

16:28.267 --> 16:30.567
- They're calling our name.
We're gonna miss it!

16:33.200 --> 16:35.700
- I don't think we're trying
to open the door anymore.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.333
- Is that what we were doing?

16:38.733 --> 16:42.067
- Man. Of all the days
not to bring my parachute.

16:42.067 --> 16:46.967
- School of Rock,
get up here or be disqualified.

16:46.967 --> 16:48.633
- It's over.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.367
We're not going to get to play.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.967
- No one's ever going
to take us seriously now.

16:54.967 --> 16:56.867
- We came so close.

16:56.867 --> 16:59.333
We even learned the song
in 20 minutes.

17:00.833 --> 17:02.333
Wait a second.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.400
We just learned a song
in 20 minutes.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.967
No one's more serious than us.

17:09.967 --> 17:13.400
- But you said we need to get
on stage to prove ourselves.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.800
- I was wrong.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.933
We don't have to prove
anything to anyone.

17:17.933 --> 17:19.733
All we need is each other.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.167
We're at Battle of the Bands!

17:22.167 --> 17:23.733
Or on top of it, anyway.

17:23.733 --> 17:28.133
So why don't we play right here,
for ourselves?

17:28.133 --> 17:29.633
- Mr. Finn is right.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.400
- Yeah, let's rock.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.800
all: Yeah!

17:32.800 --> 17:34.367
- [sighs]

17:34.367 --> 17:36.533
Well, I guess
they're not showing.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.067
And you should give the trophy
to the band

17:38.067 --> 17:42.300
with the highest score,
which appears to be...

17:42.300 --> 17:43.867
Night Lizard.

17:43.867 --> 17:47.933
Hey, that's my band.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.200
- One, two, three!

17:49.200 --> 17:50.200
- * Shut up

17:50.200 --> 17:51.867
*

17:51.867 --> 17:54.067
* Oh, don't you dare
look back *

17:54.067 --> 17:55.800
* Just keep your eyes on me

17:55.800 --> 17:57.467
* I said,
"You're holding back" *

17:57.467 --> 18:00.567
* He said, "Shut up
and dance with me" *

18:00.567 --> 18:03.067
* This moment is our destiny

18:03.067 --> 18:08.133
* He said, "Ooh, ooh,
shut up and dance with me" *

18:08.133 --> 18:10.667
*

18:10.667 --> 18:13.633
- * We were victims
of the night *

18:13.633 --> 18:17.467
* The chemical physical
kryptonite *

18:17.467 --> 18:20.900
* Helpless to the bass
and the fading light *

18:20.900 --> 18:23.700
* Oh, we were bound
to get together *

18:23.700 --> 18:25.467
* Bound to get together

18:25.467 --> 18:28.600
- And so the winner
of this year's

18:28.600 --> 18:31.933
Austin Battle of the Bands
is--

18:31.933 --> 18:33.667
[muffled music]

18:33.667 --> 18:35.433
What's that sound?

18:35.433 --> 18:37.500
- It's the sound
of my heartbeat.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.067
I'm just so excited right now.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.067
- It sounds like it's coming
from the roof.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.400
Let's go check it out.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.500
- Yeah, you guys check it out.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.067
I'll hold the trophy.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.767
Vince? Vince?

18:52.067 --> 18:53.600
- * He took my arm

18:53.600 --> 18:55.600
* I don't know how it happened *

18:55.600 --> 18:58.200
* We took the floor,
and he said *

18:58.200 --> 19:00.267
* "Oh, don't you dare
look back *

19:00.267 --> 19:01.700
* Just keep your eyes on me"

19:01.700 --> 19:03.433
* I said,
"You're holding back" *

19:03.433 --> 19:06.467
* He said, "Shut up
and dance with me" *

19:06.467 --> 19:08.933
* This moment is our destiny

19:08.933 --> 19:13.767
* He said, "Ooh, ooh,
shut up and dance with me" *

19:13.767 --> 19:15.133
*

19:15.133 --> 19:19.067
* A backless dress
and some beat-up sneaks *

19:19.067 --> 19:22.600
* A discotheque Juliet
teenage dream *

19:22.600 --> 19:24.267
- This better be good, Clark.

19:24.267 --> 19:26.500
I'm paying
my cat-sitter overtime.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.567
- Oh, this is a clean bust.

19:28.567 --> 19:32.533
Behold Mr. Finn
and his class of rule breakers.

19:35.267 --> 19:37.967
I can't wait to see
the furious look on your face.

19:40.867 --> 19:43.100
Yeah, that look.

19:44.733 --> 19:52.533
*

19:52.533 --> 19:55.967
- * Deep in his eyes,
I think I see the future *

19:55.967 --> 20:00.067
* I realize
this is my last chance *

20:00.067 --> 20:01.333
* He took my arm

20:01.333 --> 20:03.400
* I don't know how it happened *

20:03.400 --> 20:06.800
* We took the floor,
and he said *

20:06.800 --> 20:13.467
*

20:13.467 --> 20:15.300
* "Oh, don't you dare
look back *

20:15.300 --> 20:16.967
* Just keep your eyes on me"

20:16.967 --> 20:18.467
* I said,
"You're holding back" *

20:18.467 --> 20:19.800
* He said...

20:19.800 --> 20:21.667
- * "Shut up
and dance with me" *

20:21.667 --> 20:24.467
- * This moment is our destiny

20:24.467 --> 20:26.733
* He said, "Ooh, ooh"

20:26.733 --> 20:28.367
- * "Shut up and dance"

20:28.367 --> 20:29.733
- * Don't you dare look back *

20:29.733 --> 20:31.700
* Just keep your eyes on me

20:31.700 --> 20:33.533
* I said,
"You're holding back" *

20:33.533 --> 20:36.367
* He said, "Shut up
and dance with me" *

20:36.367 --> 20:38.933
* This moment is our destiny

20:38.933 --> 20:43.900
* He said, "Ooh, ooh,
shut up and dance with me" *

20:43.900 --> 20:47.267
*

20:47.267 --> 20:48.667
- * Ooh, ooh

20:48.667 --> 20:51.133
- * Shut up and dance
with me *

20:51.133 --> 20:54.433
*

20:54.433 --> 20:58.433
* Ooh, ooh,
shut up and dance with me *

20:58.433 --> 21:02.300
*

21:11.300 --> 21:13.467
Judges.

21:13.467 --> 21:17.133
[cheers and applause]

21:17.133 --> 21:22.400
So the winner of this year's
Battle of the Bands

21:22.400 --> 21:24.200
is School of Rock!

21:24.200 --> 21:27.133
[cheers and applause]

21:30.233 --> 21:32.767
- No!

21:35.633 --> 21:39.067
- Does somebody need his wubbie?

21:39.067 --> 21:41.267
- I know you're making fun
of me.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.867
But yes.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.233
- Dude, you were right
about these kids,

21:47.233 --> 21:48.867
and you've inspired me.

21:48.867 --> 21:52.200
I'm going to start a band
with a bunch of toddlers.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.267
- Rock on, man.

21:54.267 --> 21:55.900
- And since you won the bet,

21:55.900 --> 21:57.700
you can have the old name
Dewey Finn Experience back.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.367
- Thanks, but I don't need it.

22:00.367 --> 22:01.967
I'm in School of Rock.

22:01.967 --> 22:03.267
kids: Yeah!

22:03.267 --> 22:06.200
[cheers and applause]
