CONVINCE ITSELF

00:48.010 --> 00:50.240
OF ALMOST ANYTHING

02:31.280 --> 02:33.714
- ARE THOSE SILVER BULLETS?

02:33.750 --> 02:35.479
- LOOK, I WENT TO THE COPS,
AND I TOLD THEM

02:35.520 --> 02:36.544
TO PUT ME IN A CELL.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.818
AND THE DETECTIVE
I SPOKE TO SAID,

02:37.850 --> 02:40.455
"JAIL IS FOR CRIMINALS,
NOT DELUSIONAL WHACKADOOS."

02:40.490 --> 02:41.559
- HE SAID "WHACKADOOS"?

02:41.590 --> 02:43.023
- UH-HUH.
AND THEN HE PINCHED HIMSELF

02:43.060 --> 02:44.459

YOU NEED TO BE

02:59.340 --> 03:02.468
LOCKED UP AND OBSERVED?

03:02.510 --> 03:04.603
- I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
I'M A LYCAN.

03:04.650 --> 03:07.141
- LICHEN? LIKE SEAWEED?

03:07.180 --> 03:08.943

"DEE'S NUTS."
I DON'T GET IT.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.505
- I THINK I DID THAT
LAST NIGHT.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.633
- YOU THINK YOU KILLED
A LITTLE LAMB?

03:35.680 --> 03:38.774
- YES. TONIGHT COULD BE
MUCH WORSE.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.619
I WAS GONNA ASK MY SISTER
TO WATCH ME,

03:40.650 --> 03:43.380
BUT I LOVE HER AND CLEARLY FEAR
FOR HER SAFETY.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.944

ANY SECOND.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.855
- RUMBLE'S ON.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.466

04:01.500 --> 04:02.728
- IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.159

06:55.280 --> 06:56.941
IT'S LIKE WATCHING SOMEONE

07:28.680 --> 07:30.170
AND JUMPED THROUGH
OUR DOUBLE-PANED WINDOW.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.677
- IT'S NOT EVEN
SORT OF DOUBLE-PANED.

07:31.710 --> 07:34.975

HE BROKE THROUGH HIS CHAINS?

07:35.020 --> 07:36.169
- FIGURATIVELY, YES.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.313
LITERALLY, IT WAS
DUCT TAPE AND KITE STRING.

07:38.350 --> 07:39.487
- YES.
- LET ME GUESS.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.317
HE CHEWED HIS WAY OUT
WITH HIS BIG, BAD TEETH,

07:41.360 --> 07:42.588
ALL THE BETTER
TO EAT YOU WITH.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.257
- WE WERE SLEEPING,
SO WE CAN'T CONFIRM

07:44.290 --> 07:45.757
HOW POINTY HIS EARS WERE,
LASSIE.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.451
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT HIS EARS.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.728
- THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

- YEAH. EVEN THOUGH
I WOULDN'T LOCK HIM UP

08:00.680 --> 08:01.977
BECAUSE HE WAS FROM
THE PLANET WOLFEN,

08:02.010 --> 08:04.103
HE STILL TOLD ME TO COME DOWN
AND HAVE MY PALM READ

08:11.150 --> 08:13.015
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAG ALONG?

08:13.060 --> 08:15.312
- I WOULD RATHER ADOPT
A CHILD.

09:43.580 --> 09:46.378
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT
HE MIGHT BE A LYCAN.

09:46.410 --> 09:47.547
- NOT THE DRUPE FRUIT.

09:47.580 --> 09:50.515
RATHER, THE HAIRY BIPED
THAT HUNTS AND MAULS.

09:50.550 --> 09:53.656
- YES, I WAS AFRAID
THAT COULD BE THE CASE.

09:53.690 --> 09:54.987
EVER SINCE HE WAS BITTEN,

09:55.020 --> 09:57.079
HE'S BEEN ACTING PECULIAR
AND BLACKING OUT.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.519
ALL SIGNS POINT DIRECTLY
TO THE MARK OF THE BEAST.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.289
- UH, DID YOU JUST SAY
"BITTEN"?

10:01.330 --> 10:03.491
- YES. WE WERE ON
A MYSTICAL MARCH

10:03.530 --> 10:06.090
IN THE DICK SMITH WILDERNESS
IN SANTA YNEZ A FEW WEEKS AGO.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.961
WE GOT LOST,
AND HE WENT OFF-TRAIL

10:08.000 --> 10:10.309
TO MAKE WATER IN THE DARKNESS--
THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENED.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.501
- SURE HOPE HE FINISHED
HIS BUSINESS.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.371
- HE SAID HE SAW TEETH,
FUR, AND A SNOUT.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.469
NOT NECESSARILY
IN THAT ORDER.

10:16.510 --> 10:19.604
HE'S BEEN SO ELUSIVE
THIS PAST WEEK.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.413
HE WON'T LET ME OR ANY OTHER
OF THE SHAMANS

10:21.450 --> 10:22.747
IN OUR HEALING RHOMBUS
HELP HIM

10:22.790 --> 10:24.382
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO PUT US IN DANGER.

10:24.420 --> 10:29.551
WOW, IT'S REALLY STARTING
TO SINK IN.

10:29.590 --> 10:32.957
MY BIG BRO.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.390
- WILLOW, ANY IDEA WHERE
HE MIGHT BE NOW?

10:36.430 --> 10:38.022
- WE'RE FEARLESS,
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP,

10:38.070 --> 10:39.025
AND ONE OF US IS SINGLE.

10:39.070 --> 10:42.631
- AND CLEARLY GOTH-CURIOUS.

10:42.670 --> 10:43.830
TRUST US, YOU DON'T WANT
THE COPS TO FIND HIM

10:43.870 --> 10:45.167
BEFORE WE DO.

10:45.210 --> 10:48.702
- WELL, I SUSPECT HE'S HIDING
AND SCARED TO DEATH,

10:48.740 --> 10:50.708
WHAT WITH THE THIRD
AND FINAL FULL MOON.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.116
WHICH ISN'T EXACTLY FULL,
JUST ESPECIALLY GIBBOUS.

10:53.150 --> 10:55.744
HIS NEED TO FEED TONIGHT
WILL BE MORE INTENSE

10:55.780 --> 10:58.180
THAN ANYTHING
YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

10:58.220 --> 11:01.018
- I SEE. WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE,
AND WHY?

11:01.060 --> 11:02.118
- FRIENDS, AND A COUPLE
OF THE OTHERS

11:02.160 --> 11:03.559
FROM STEWART'S THERAPY GROUP.

11:03.590 --> 11:04.579
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.359
STEW'S BIRTHDAY LAST YEAR.

11:06.390 --> 11:08.051
- IS THAT SHANGRI-LALA'S?

11:08.100 --> 11:09.920
- STEW KNOWS SOMEONE
WHO WORKS THERE.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.323
WE GOT HALF OFF
THE PARTY PACKAGE,

11:11.370 --> 11:12.837
AND WE GOT TO BRING
OUR OWN VAMPIRE GEISHA.

11:12.870 --> 11:15.031
- NOW, THAT'S A PARTY.

11:15.070 --> 11:16.162
THANK YOU, WILLOW.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.428
PLEASE CALL US
IF STEWART SHOWS UP.

11:17.470 --> 11:20.030
OUR NUMBER'S ON THE BACK,
IN PENCIL.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.968
BUT FEEL FREE TO USE
MY WORK CELL ON THE FRONT.

11:22.010 --> 11:25.502
- PLEASE FIND MY BROTHER
BEFORE HE EATS AN INNOCENT.

11:25.550 --> 11:27.017
- "BITTEN," SHAWN?

11:27.050 --> 11:29.245
IF SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH,
THE MAN WAS BITTEN BY A BEAST.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.713
THIS MAY BE ABOVE
OUR PAY GRADE.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.355
- GUS, DON'T BE THE THIRD
THOMPSON TWIN WITH THE DREADS.

11:33.390 --> 11:34.789
THIS IS EXACTLY
AT OUR PAY GRADE.

11:34.820 --> 11:35.957
PLUS, WE'RE HIS ONLY HOPE.

11:35.990 --> 11:37.457
IMAGINE BEING HIM RIGHT NOW?

11:37.490 --> 11:38.787
OF COURSE, THEN YOU WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO GET JIGGY

11:38.830 --> 11:40.058
WITH HIS SISTER.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.795
- DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT HER
LIKE THAT, SHAWN.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.525
SHE'S CLEARLY
IN EMOTIONAL PERIL,

11:43.570 --> 11:44.696
AND HER HEART IS HEAW.

11:44.730 --> 11:45.799
AND ALL THAT WEIRD,
SEXY MAKEUP

11:45.830 --> 11:46.865
IS JUST A CRY FOR HELP

11:46.900 --> 11:49.334
FROM A STRONG MAN
WITH A SOLID JOB.

11:49.370 --> 11:52.168
- LOOK AT YOU CRUSHING
ON VAMPIRA.

11:52.210 --> 11:53.871
OH...
[cell phone rings]

11:53.910 --> 11:56.538
WHO IS THIS?

11:56.580 --> 11:58.548
HEL--

11:58.580 --> 11:59.945
- [quietly] SHAWN, I NEED YOU
TO COME TO LEADBETTER BEACH

11:59.980 --> 12:02.244
AND BRING ME A 36-HOUR
SURVIVAL BASKET.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.510
- LOOK, DAD, I'M A LITTLE
TIED UP RIGHT NOW.

12:04.550 --> 12:05.847
- SHAWN, THIS IS A PERSONAL
CHALLENGE THAT INVOLVES

12:05.890 --> 12:07.619
A FORMER NEMESIS
AND SOMETHING I DESERVE.

12:07.660 --> 12:08.615
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:08.660 --> 12:10.878
- NOT EVEN SORT OF.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.955
- BRING ME TWO HAM SANDWICHES
ON STONE GROUND WHEAT--

12:13.000 --> 12:16.254
MUSTARD, NO MAYO.
PLENTY OF ELECT ROLYTE LIQUIDS,

12:16.300 --> 12:17.665
AND A FLASHLIGHT.

12:17.700 --> 12:18.962
ASAP.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.194
- OKAY, FOLKS, HERE WE GO.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.038
KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THIS
BRAND NEW BEAUTIFUL TRUCK

12:23.070 --> 12:24.958
AND SEE HOW LONG
YOU CAN LAST.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.308
LAST MAN STANDING
DRIVES IT HOME.

12:27.340 --> 12:31.003
- NO MERCY, SPENCER.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.181
- OH, GOD.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.578
- HOT OFF THE WIRE, ANOTHER
POSSIBLE ANIMAL ATTACK.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.612
ABOUT SIX MILES FROM WHERE
THAT POOR LITTLE LAMB

13:08.650 --> 13:10.345
WAS RIPPED APART
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.858
- HUNTERS?
- MUST'VE BEEN LOUSY SHOTS.

13:12.890 --> 13:16.189
- SON OF A BITCH.
- WHAT IS IT?

13:16.220 --> 13:17.619
- MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

13:17.660 --> 13:19.150
SPENCER'S GONNA BE CALLING ME
ANY SECOND.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.499
LET'S GO.
- UM, RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

13:21.530 --> 13:24.658
I'M JUST GONNA STOP OFF
AT THE LADIES' ROOM FIRST.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.608
- UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS IS GETTING SERIOUS.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.848
- DUDE, HE COMPLETELY FORGOT
ABOUT HIS BAG.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.472
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
SHAWN?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.715
- PREPARING TO PLAY HOT CROSS
BUNS ON THE RECORDER.

13:43.750 --> 13:44.887
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M DOING?

13:44.920 --> 13:45.989
- YOU CAN'T JUST GO RIFLING

13:46.020 --> 13:47.180
THROUGH ANOTHER MAN'S STUFF,
SHAWN.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.380
[high-pitched squeak]

13:48.420 --> 13:49.648
- PRETTY SURE
THE PRIVACY BARRIER WAS BROKEN

13:49.690 --> 13:51.089
WHEN YOU DUCT -TAPED
HIS THIGHS TOGETHER.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.722
- IT HELPED RESTRICT
THE FLEXIBILITY

13:52.760 --> 13:53.727
IN HIS HIPS, SHAWN.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.954
- "ONE CAPSULE BEFORE BEDTIME."

13:55.000 --> 13:56.649
WHAT IS HALOPERIDOL
PRESCRIBED FOR?

13:56.700 --> 13:57.860
- SCHIZOPHRENIA.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.891
IT ALSO REDUCES AGGRESSION
TOWARDS OTHERS.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.362
AND USED IN COMBINATION
WITH CHLORPROMAZINE,

14:01.400 --> 14:02.628
CAN CONTROL HICCU PS.

14:02.670 --> 14:03.967
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
DR. KEN TUCKER?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.739
- PSYCHIATRIST.
HE'S NOT ON MY ROUTE.

14:05.770 --> 14:07.408
BUT HE IS DOING WELL
FOR HIMSELF.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.670
HE JUST MOVED HIS PRACTICE
INTO NEW DIGS ON ARTHUR AVENUE.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.144
- NO KIDDING.
I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

14:12.180 --> 14:14.239
WE'VE HAD A CASE WITH A DOCTOR
WHO WASN'T ON YOUR ROUTE.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.669
- ALL STREAKS ARE MADE
TO BE BROKEN, SHAWN.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.415
- WELL, IF THIS GUY THINKS
STEW NEEDS HELP

14:18.450 --> 14:19.815
CONTROLLING HIS AGGRESSION,

14:19.850 --> 14:21.818
WE SHOULD PROBABLY PAY HIM
A VISIT, DON'T YOU THINK?

14:25.360 --> 14:27.157
- WHOA, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.054
THIS GUY'S FEELING GOOD
ABOUT HIMSELF, HUH?

14:29.100 --> 14:31.022
- HIS OFFICE IS THIS WAY,
SHAWN.

14:31.070 --> 14:34.233
- OH, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.
RIGHT ON THE DOOR THERE.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.344
HELLO THERE, MYRTLE.

14:43.380 --> 14:46.406
MY NAME IS R.P. MCMURPHY.
THIS IS MY PARTNER CHESWICKE.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.315
WE BOTH HAVE SOME FAULTY WIRING
UP IN OUR NOGGINS,

14:48.350 --> 14:51.285
AND I'M AFRAID WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TALK TO THE DOC.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.709
- NO CAN DO, SAILOR.
PUSH ON!

14:53.760 --> 14:55.489
- [whispering]
SHE TOTALLY SHOT ME DOWN.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.919
- [whispering] I GOT IT.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.191
MYRTLE, WHEN IS DR. TUCKER'S
NEXT AVAILABLE SESSION?

15:00.230 --> 15:04.269
- APRIL 25, 2011.
NOW HIT THE BRICKS, WOODPECKER.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.792
- MYRTLE, IS THERE
A STANDBY OPTION

15:07.840 --> 15:09.569
FOR EXT RA-CRAZY PEOPLE
WHO VERY WELL

15:09.600 --> 15:10.931
MAY POSE A THREAT TO OTHERS?

15:10.970 --> 15:13.734
- YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS
TO MAKE LIKE MY THIRD HUSBAND

15:13.780 --> 15:15.338
AND DISAPPEAR.

15:17.410 --> 15:19.674
- [quietly] I DON'T THINK WE
CAN HANG WITH THIS OLD BIRD.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.440
- NO.
[intercom buzzes]

15:22.480 --> 15:24.846
- YES, DR. TUCKER?

15:24.890 --> 15:26.846
HEAVENS TO BETSY!
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

15:26.890 --> 15:28.517
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

15:28.560 --> 15:30.926
- POLEXIA, CALM DOWN.
- DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.518
- MYRTLE,
GIVE ME SOME HELP HERE.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.391
- OH, DEAR.

15:34.430 --> 15:35.522
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
SHAWN?

15:35.560 --> 15:36.788
GET FROM BEHIND THAT DESK.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.196
THAT WOMAN IS GONNA KILL YOU.
- PATIENT INFO.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.936
- GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
I'LL TAKE A FEW PICTURES.

15:40.970 --> 15:42.267
- USE YOUR OWN PHONE.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.767
- I LEFT IT IN THE CAR.
- TOO BAD FOR YOU.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.232
- JUST GIMME YOUR PHONE!
- SHE'S GONNA BREAK MY PHONE.

15:45.270 --> 15:47.135
- SHE'S GONNA BE BACK OUT HERE!
GIMME THE PHONE ONE TIME!

15:47.180 --> 15:48.909
- HURRY UP.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.475
- DUDE, ARE MY EYES SEEING
WHAT MY BRAIN IS

15:51.510 --> 15:53.011
TELLING MY EYES
THAT THEY'RE SEEING?

15:53.050 --> 15:55.177
- THAT'S ME AND RUIZ THE KOALA.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.415
I MAKE A YEARLY DONATION TO
THE "BEAR WITH ME" FOUNDATION

15:57.450 --> 15:58.542
TO HELP PROTECT THE LIVES

15:58.590 --> 16:00.649
OF THESE PRECIOUS
AND UNIQUE CREATURES.

16:00.690 --> 16:01.816
- YOU'RE CUDDLING
THE ANIMAL?

16:01.860 --> 16:02.952
- WE'RE NUZZLING.

16:02.990 --> 16:05.322
AND RUIZ MADE
THE FIRST MOVE, SHAWN.

16:08.100 --> 16:12.025
[camera clicking]

16:12.070 --> 16:13.833
HERE SHE COMES.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.832
- OH, THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

16:18.870 --> 16:20.770
- THOSE BOYS ARE DUMB AS RAIN.

16:20.810 --> 16:22.698
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

16:25.410 --> 16:28.208
- ACTUALLY, YOU WON'T.

16:28.250 --> 16:32.448
I HAVE TO GO.
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.288
- DON'T DO ANYTHING
YOU MIGHT REGRET, GIRLY.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.050
REMEMBER WHY YOU CAME TO US
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.121
- EXCUSE US.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.865
[clicks tongue]
MYRTLE...

16:50.910 --> 16:52.639
[clears throat]

16:52.670 --> 16:55.377
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US
TO SPEAK WITH THE DOCTOR

16:55.410 --> 16:57.605
IN A NON-THERAPY CAPACITY?

16:57.650 --> 17:01.677
YOU KNOW, LIKE GENTLEMEN.
- BEAT IT.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.280
- THAT WAS A DISASTER.
- I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

17:04.320 --> 17:07.448
SO IF I WAS TO NUZZLE WITH
A NON-DOMESTICATED ZOO DWELLER,

17:07.490 --> 17:08.855
I THINK I'D GO WITH A GIRAFFE.

17:08.890 --> 17:10.323
- GIRAFFES ARE CHRONIC
SPITTERS.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.429
- I'D CLIMB UP AND RISK IT.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.519
THEY'VE GOT THOSE GIANT
DOUGHNUT LIPS.

17:13.560 --> 17:17.724
- WOW, LIKE TWO CHRISTMAS HAMS
KISSING UNDER MISTLETOE.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.897
- DID THAT SMOKIN' HOT MESS
LOOK FAMILIAR TO YOU?

17:19.930 --> 17:22.262
- NO, I WOULD HAVE
REMEMBERED THAT.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.700
- WELL, WELL.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.571
- ALL RIGHT. FINE.

17:27.610 --> 17:29.703
I DESERVE THIS ONE.
LET'S HEAR IT.

17:29.740 --> 17:31.674
- FOR WHO? THE BOY?

17:31.710 --> 17:33.746
THAT'S ON GUS' iPOD.
IT'S BACK AT THE OFFICE.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.714
- WH--?
- DON'T SAY A WORD

17:35.750 --> 17:37.945
ABOUT DENISE WILLIAMS.
- WHO?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.117
- THERE WAS ANOTHER
ANIMAL ATTACK LAST NIGHT.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.912
AND THIS TIME IT WASN'T
A POOR LITTLE LAMB.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.279
- OH, NO.
- OH, YES.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.025
- SEEMS YOUR DELUSIONAL
LITTLE BUDDY'S UPGRADED

17:45.060 --> 17:47.449
TO HUNTERS.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.220
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S SUDDENLY
ON THE BLACK AND TAN EXPRESS.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.091
- NO, I DON'T THINK WE'RE
CHASING A WEREWOLF, SPENCER.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.994
JUST ANOTHER CUCKOO WHO'S SEEN
TOO MANY MOVIES.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.531
- UPDATE: WE DON'T HAVE
ANY ACTUAL PROOF THAT STEWART--

17:58.570 --> 17:59.969
- SPENCER, HE PRETTY MUCH
CONFESSED TO BOTH OF US,

18:00.010 --> 18:01.637
AND HE HAS NO ALIBI,
REMEMBER?

18:01.680 --> 18:03.648
- GOOD LUCK GETTING BY
DR. TUCKER'S PIT BULL

18:03.680 --> 18:05.272
OF A RECEPTIONIST.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.607
- MAYBE YOU JUST DIDN'T HAVE
THE RIGHT TOOLS.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.810
- I DON'T THINK THE MONOCLE

18:07.850 --> 18:09.249
IS GONNA HELP YOU
IN THIS SITUATION.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.579
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
ONE OF THESE. IDIOT.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.281
- HEY, JULES,

18:14.320 --> 18:16.413
ANYTHING BACK YET
ON THE FOLLICLE?

18:16.460 --> 18:18.553
- NO, BUT KEEP YOUR PHONES ON,
AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

18:18.590 --> 18:21.855
THIS IS OUR CASE NOW TOO.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.390
- MAYBE WE SHOULD LET THEM
TAKE IT FROM HERE.

18:23.430 --> 18:26.024
- GUS, IF WE TURN AWAY
EVERY WEREWOLF CASE

18:26.070 --> 18:28.163
THAT COMES THROUGH OUR DOORS,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA START TALKING.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.963
BESIDES, DO YOU REALLY THINK
STEW IS

18:30.000 --> 18:31.433
SPROUTING HAIR AND FANGS,

18:31.470 --> 18:33.176
UNABLE TO RESIST
SOME SORT OF BLOOD LUST

18:33.210 --> 18:34.734
WHEN THE MOON IS FULL?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.509
- IF HE ISN'T, THEN HE'S SOME
CRAZY DUDE WHO THINKS HE IS.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.201
BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE IF HE'S OUT THERE

18:38.250 --> 18:40.969
KILLING PEOPLE
AND PRECIOUS WOOLY ANIMALS?

18:41.020 --> 18:42.669
- NONE, I GUESS.

18:46.890 --> 18:49.450
- I HAVE TO GO.
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

18:49.490 --> 18:51.549
- HOLD ON.
- WHAT IS IT?

18:51.590 --> 18:54.798
- CHECK OUT THOSE PICTURES
I TOOK WITH YOUR PHONE.

18:54.830 --> 18:57.719
DUDE, I KNEW I'D SEEN
THAT CHICK BEFORE!

18:57.770 --> 19:00.159
SHE'S A BARTENDER
AT SHANGRI-LALA'S.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.829
TELL ME I'M RIGHT.
AM I RIGHT?

19:03.870 --> 19:07.533
- SHE SURE IS.
HER NAME IS POLEXIA.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.730
- WASN'T THAT ANNA PAQUIN'S
NAME IN ALMOST FAMOUS ?

19:09.780 --> 19:12.271
- ANNA PAQUIN WAS IN
ALMOST FAMOUS?

19:12.310 --> 19:15.279
- LET'S GET A DRINK.

19:17.820 --> 19:20.254
- I'M GONNA NEED TO SPEAK WITH
A DR. KEN TUCKER IMMEDIATELY.

19:20.290 --> 19:22.611
- WELL, IF IT AIN'T
LITTLE DOROTHY

19:22.660 --> 19:24.218
AND HER PAL SCARECROW.

19:24.260 --> 19:27.127
WHERE'S THE TIN MAN
AND THE COWARDLY LION?

19:27.160 --> 19:32.063
- WELL, HERE'S THE TIN MAN...

19:33.540 --> 19:35.360
AND HERE'S TOTO.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.729
- FOLLOW ME.

19:38.770 --> 19:41.079
- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS
VERY TROUBLING.

19:41.110 --> 19:42.930
- WELL, DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
THE SORT OF THING

19:42.980 --> 19:46.643
GIMBLEY'S CAPABLE OF,
IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION?

19:46.680 --> 19:48.216
- STEWART HAS A VERY ACTIVE
IMAGINATION.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.741
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.
- I HEARD WHAT YOU ASKED.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.089
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME SAY?
I TOOK AN OATH.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.111
MY JOB IS TO HELP PEOPLE
LIKE STEWART

19:56.160 --> 19:57.957
TO OVERCOME
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HURDLES

19:57.990 --> 20:00.720
THAT IMPAIR THEIR DESIRE
TO LEAD WHAT WE CONSIDER

20:00.760 --> 20:03.092
TO BE NORMAL, EVERYDAY LIVES.

20:03.130 --> 20:04.461
TAKE A LOOK AROUND,
DETECTIVE.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.798
MY SUCCESS RATE IN THIS AREA
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.899
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

20:07.940 --> 20:08.895
- WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

20:08.940 --> 20:10.635
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

20:10.670 --> 20:14.902
TWO MEN ARE DEAD, AND
TONIGHT'S ANOTHER FULL MOON.

20:14.940 --> 20:16.635
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.477
- MY OPINION IS THAT
YOU'RE DEALING WITH

20:18.510 --> 20:19.704
A VERY TROUBLED YOUNG MAN.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.617
- NO KIDDING.

20:22.650 --> 20:26.882
- A FEW WEEKS AGO, STEWART TOOK
A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.457
IT IS POSSIBLE
HE IS BLURRING THE LINES

20:29.490 --> 20:32.050
BETWEEN REALITY
AND A MUCH DARKER FANTASY.

20:32.090 --> 20:34.820
AT THE END OF OUR LAST SESSION,
HE EVEN BECAME EMOTIONAL

20:34.860 --> 20:37.499
AND, UH...GAVE ME A HUG.

20:37.530 --> 20:38.827
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

20:38.870 --> 20:40.735
- IN THE EVENT
HE NEVER SAW ME AGAIN.

20:40.770 --> 20:43.307
- YEAH, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE MIGHT BE?

20:43.340 --> 20:45.035
- I WISH I KNEW.

20:45.070 --> 20:48.972
SOMEONE NEEDS TO SAVE HIM
FROM HIMSELF.

20:52.580 --> 20:56.778
- HELLO, GENTLEMEN.
WHAT'LL IT BE?

20:56.820 --> 20:58.708
- WELL, HE WOULD LIKE
A ROY ROGERS.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.082
THAT MUCH WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN.
- WHAAAT?

21:02.890 --> 21:04.721
- YOU LOOK REALLY FAMILIAR
TO ME.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.456
- YEAH, I'VE JUST GOT
ONE OF THOSE FACES, I GUESS.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.456
- NOPE, I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.321
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE.

21:12.370 --> 21:15.168
WAIT A SECOND.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.135
ARE YOU A PATIENT
OF DR. KEN TUCKER?

21:18.170 --> 21:19.660
- NO.

21:19.710 --> 21:21.177
- I KNEW IT!
I TOTALLY KNEW IT.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.768
WE WERE JUST THERE
EARLIER TODAY.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.573
TRYING TO GET MY BUDDY HARRY
MONROE HERE AN APPOINTMENT.

21:24.610 --> 21:26.043
HE'S ABSOLUTELY STIR CRAZY.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.139
- YEAH, AND SKIP HERE
HAS ROMANTIC DREAMS

21:28.180 --> 21:29.977
ABOUT FIREMEN WHO LOOK LIKE
DOLPH LUNDGREN.

21:30.020 --> 21:33.114
- WHAT?
YOU CHEEKY SCREWBALL.

21:33.150 --> 21:34.981
WHAT'D I TELL YOU,
HE'S WACKO.

21:35.020 --> 21:36.749
- NO, YOU SAID IT WAS LATE,
AND YOU WERE IN A FIREHOUSE,

21:36.790 --> 21:37.984
AND YOU SLID DOWN
THIS LARGE POLE--

21:38.030 --> 21:38.985
- WHAT ARE YOU--WHY?
- YOU STARTED IT.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.429
- OKAY, FINE.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.792
HAVE YOU ENJOYED YOUR
EXPERIENCE WITH DR. TUCKER?

21:42.830 --> 21:44.695
HE COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
BY A FELLOW NAMED

21:44.730 --> 21:46.459
STEWART GIMBLEY.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.298
- STEWART GIMBLEY. YEAH,
I KNOW THAT LITTLE WEIRDO.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.432
I DIALED HIM UP
WITH A GREAT DEAL

21:50.470 --> 21:52.904
ON OUR BIRTHDAY PACKAGE
LAST YEAR.

21:52.940 --> 21:54.168
GOD, WHAT A FREAK.

21:54.210 --> 21:55.768
YOU KNOW, HE TOLD ME ONCE

21:55.810 --> 21:58.176
THAT HIS FATHER IS SOME SORT
OF DEMON RABBI.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.519
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.017
BUT AS FAR AS THE DOC GOES,

22:02.050 --> 22:03.449
I MEAN, IF WE REALLY WANTED
AN APPOINTMENT--

22:03.490 --> 22:05.014
- LOOK, I'M PROBABLY NOT
THE BEST PERSON TO ASK

22:05.050 --> 22:06.278
ABOUT DR. TUCKER.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.810
- AND WHY IS THAT?

22:07.860 --> 22:10.579
- 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE SEEING HIM ANYMORE.

22:10.630 --> 22:14.555
I'M NOT SURE ANYONE WILL,
ACTUALLY. CAPICHE?

22:14.600 --> 22:18.058
- NO, I...NOT REALLY. NO.
- NO.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.124
- UH, COULD YOU ELABORATE?

22:19.170 --> 22:22.469
- I SHOULDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ELSE.

22:22.500 --> 22:25.298
LOOK, THERE ARE PLENTY
OF SHRINKS IN THIS TOWN.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.376
TRUST ME.

22:27.410 --> 22:29.970
DID YOU DECIDE
ON SOMETHING TO DRINK OR WHAT?

22:30.010 --> 22:32.046
- UH, YES. YES, I HAVE.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.240
I'D LIKE A SLOE GIN FIZZ,
PLEASE.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.874
HOLD THE GIN, EXTRA FIZZ.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.014
- AND I'LL HAVE
SOME MORE CHERRIES.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.654
[suspenseful music]

22:46.690 --> 22:52.697
*

23:09.450 --> 23:11.714
-AAH!

23:11.750 --> 23:14.253
- HELP ME. PLEASE.

23:14.290 --> 23:16.952
HELP ME.

23:24.130 --> 23:27.998
- OKAY, THIS IS REALLY, REALLY--
[balloon pops]

23:28.040 --> 23:30.065
REALLY NOT GOOD.
- OF COURSE IT'S NOT.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.169
I WOKE UP NEXT TO A PAIR
OF DEAD HUNTERS

23:31.210 --> 23:32.734
WHO WERE TORN TO SHREDS.

23:32.770 --> 23:34.977
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T FOCUS UNTIL
WE HANDLE THIS WARDROBE ISSUE.

23:35.010 --> 23:37.774
[loud pop]

23:37.810 --> 23:39.141
- AGREED.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.272
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

23:40.310 --> 23:42.312
YOU CAN USE MY HALLOWEEN
COSTUME FROM LAST YEAR,

23:42.350 --> 23:43.715
WHICH JUST SO HAPPENS
TO BE IN STORAGE HERE.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.115
- REALLY?

23:45.150 --> 23:46.378
- IN THE BACK ROOM
THERE'S A BANKER'S BOX

23:46.420 --> 23:47.455
WITH A HAND-DRAWN
JACK-O-LANTERN ON IT.

23:47.490 --> 23:50.379
COSTUME'S INSIDE.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.596
SHAWN, WE NEED TO CALL LASSITER
AND JULIET

23:57.630 --> 23:59.723
AND MAKE A CITIZEN'S ARREST
NOW, WHILE HE'S DOCILE.

23:59.770 --> 24:01.658
- SINCE WHEN DO WE MAKE
CITIZEN'S ARRESTS?

24:01.700 --> 24:03.338
- SINCE A GUY SHOWED UP
IN OUR CLOSET NAKED,

24:03.370 --> 24:04.962
COVERING HIS JUNK
WITH A BUNCH OF BALLOONS,

24:05.010 --> 24:08.138
SAYING HE WOKE UP SMACK
NEXT TO THE VICTIMS.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.239
- SOMETHING FEELS OFF.
- WHAT FEELS OFF?

24:10.280 --> 24:14.944
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.174
- THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLY FAST.

24:16.220 --> 24:18.347
- WHOA, YOU EVEN PUT ON
THE GLASSES.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.688
- WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO BE?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.381
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

24:22.420 --> 24:24.183
YOU DIDN'T WATCH TELEVISION
AS A KID?

24:24.230 --> 24:25.754
- NOT AFTER POLTERGEIST.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.451
- YOU ARE NONE OTHER THAN
DWAYNE CLEOPHUS WAYNE

24:27.500 --> 24:28.649
OF A DIFFERENT WORLD.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.464
A LADIES' MAN WITH A PLAN.
WHAT?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.320
- NO.

24:33.370 --> 24:34.359
- STEW, YOU KNOW
YOU'VE PUT US

24:34.400 --> 24:35.765
IN A TOUGH SPOT
COMING BACK HERE.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.837
- I KNOW.
I'LL TURN MYSELF IN.

24:38.870 --> 24:40.576
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
I COULD HAVE DONE.

24:40.610 --> 24:42.999
I WARNED EVERYONE.
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.008
I'VE NEVER HURT ANYBODY
MY WHOLE LIFE.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.939
- STEW, LOOK AT YOURSELF, MAN.
I MEAN, YOU'RE YOU.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.709
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE DOING THESE THINGS.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.310
- I KNOW, BUT THERE ISN'T
A SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE

24:52.350 --> 24:53.658
TO SUGGEST THAT I'M NOT.

24:53.690 --> 24:55.317
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US?

24:55.360 --> 24:57.351
I MEAN, NOTHING CAN HURT
YOUR CAUSE AT THIS POINT.

24:57.390 --> 25:00.621
- OKAY. WELL,
WILLOW DISAGREES,

25:00.660 --> 25:04.027
BUT I HAVE LONG SINCE SUSPECT ED
THAT OUR FATHER, RABBI GIMBLEY,

25:04.070 --> 25:05.264
IS ACTUALLY A DYBBUK,

25:05.300 --> 25:07.222
AND THAT WE MIGHT BE THE SPAWN
OF DEMON SEED.

25:07.270 --> 25:10.603
KEEPING IN MIND, OF COURSE,
THAT NOT ALL DEMONS ARE BAD.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.939
TAKE HELLBOY, FOR INSTANCE.
HE'S...NICE.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.504
- POLEXIA WASN'T KIDDING.

25:15.540 --> 25:18.873
- POLEXIA? WHAT--YOU...
TALKED WITH THE BLACK WIDOW?

25:18.910 --> 25:20.468
- YOU CALL HER
"THE BLACK WIDOW"?

25:20.510 --> 25:21.545
- NOT JUST ME.

25:21.580 --> 25:23.810
ALL OF US IN THE GROUP.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.249
SHE WAS ONCE MARRIED
TO THIS GUY

25:25.290 --> 25:26.712
WHO COULDN'T GROW HAIR...
WHAT'S THAT CALLED?

25:26.750 --> 25:28.149
- BALD.
- ALOPECIA.

25:28.190 --> 25:29.919
- THAT'S THE FEAR OF BEANS.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.428
- SO ONE DAY, POLEXIA
TIES HIM UP TO THE BED

25:32.460 --> 25:34.496
AND GAGS HIM AND ALL THAT,
YOU KNOW,

25:34.530 --> 25:36.020
BECAUSE SHE WAS INTO
SOME VERY KINKY BUSINESS.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.288
- SURE.
- GO ON.

25:37.330 --> 25:39.093
- AND THIS POOR GUY
HAD A HEART ATTACK AND CROAKED.

25:39.130 --> 25:40.995
BUT ALSO, SHE USED TO
TOTALLY DOMINATE OUR SESSIONS,

25:41.040 --> 25:44.134
LIKE HER PROBLEMS ARE
MORE IMPORTANT THAN OURS.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.365
BUT WE PUT UP WITH IT,
FOR THE MOST PART,

25:46.410 --> 25:48.173
BECAUSE SHE HAS
VOLUPTUOUS BUTTOCKS.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.576
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "USED TO
DOMINATE" YOUR SESSIONS?

25:50.610 --> 25:52.248
- WELL, SHE ONCE THREATENED
DR. TUCKER

25:52.280 --> 25:54.441
DURING A NEO-JUNGIAN
SHARING EXERCISE,

25:54.480 --> 25:57.017
AND EVER SINCE THEN, SHE ONLY
DOES ONE-ON-ONES WITH HIM.

25:57.050 --> 26:00.850
- REALLY? STEW. ..

26:00.890 --> 26:04.018
WE'RE TAKING YOU
TO YOUR SISTER AT OCCULTOPUSS.

26:04.060 --> 26:06.187
- WE ARE?
SHAWN, THE MAN IS WANTED

26:06.230 --> 26:08.494
FOR A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND
FIRST-DEGREE LAMB SLAUGHTER.

26:08.530 --> 26:10.225
- I KNOW THIS, GUS.
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THIS?

26:10.260 --> 26:12.694
LOOK, I'M TAKING A HUGE
LEAP OF FAITH HERE, OKAY?

26:12.730 --> 26:14.334
YOU ARE TO STAY PUT
AT OCCULTOPUS

26:14.370 --> 26:16.031
UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM US--
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:16.070 --> 26:18.834
- NO, I CAN'T PUT WILLOW IN
HARM'S WAY--IT'S UNBROTHERLY.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.475
- LISTEN, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA TURN INTO

26:21.510 --> 26:23.535
A GIANT DOG HEAD TONIGHT,
OKAY?

26:23.580 --> 26:25.275
I'M GETTING SERIOUS VIBES
THAT YOU ARE PART

26:25.310 --> 26:27.198
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S
NEFARIOUS PLAN.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.717
- WHY?
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE VULNERABLE.

26:28.750 --> 26:31.116
AND YOU LOOK LIKE THAT. AND
YOU BELIEVE IN WEIRD THINGS.

26:31.150 --> 26:32.447
HAVE WILLOW LOCK YOU
IN THE BATHROOM,

26:32.490 --> 26:33.616
JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.752
WE'RE GONNA GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

26:34.790 --> 26:36.883
IT ALL ENDS NICE.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.252
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?
- I DO.

26:39.290 --> 26:40.621
I MEAN, YOU'RE STILL
A WEIRD LITTLE DUDE,

26:40.660 --> 26:42.127
AND YOU'LL PROBABLY BE SINGLE
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.993
BUT I THINK WE CAN KEEP YOU
OUT OF JAIL. DEAL?

26:45.030 --> 26:47.328
- DEAL.

26:47.370 --> 26:49.531
- MY MAN.

26:53.210 --> 26:56.077
- BE CAREFUL.
- DON'T WORRY, I GOT IT.

26:57.780 --> 27:00.499
- ALL RIGHT, YOU DROP
THAT COOLER IN YOUR BACKSEAT

27:00.550 --> 27:02.313
OFF AT THE BEACH TO MY DAD,

27:02.350 --> 27:04.511
THEN WE LAY LOW UNTIL
DR. TUCKER'S OFFICE CLOSES.

27:04.550 --> 27:06.484
- THEN WHAT?
- WE FINESSE OUR WAY IN.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.057
WE FIND SOME EVIDENCE THAT
STEW'S NOT A HAIRY MONSTER,

27:09.090 --> 27:10.955
AND THAT IT'S ACTUALLY POLEXIA
THAT'S BEHIND

27:10.990 --> 27:12.958
ALL THIS NEFARIOUSNESS.

27:12.990 --> 27:15.788
AHH...
[cell phone rings]

27:15.830 --> 27:18.298
HELLO.
- SHAWN, IT'S WOLF HAIR.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.093
AUTHENTIC WOLF HAIR.

27:20.130 --> 27:22.098
AND WE SPOKE
TO DR. KEN TUCKER.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.869
HE SAID STEWART IS
A VERY TROUBLED YOUNG MAN.

27:23.910 --> 27:27.607
- NO PROBLEM.
- UM, UH...OKAY.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.938
- I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THIS, SHAWN.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.972
WHO WAS THAT?
- IT WAS A WRONG NUMBER.

27:39.950 --> 27:43.613
- TWO HOURS TILL SUNDOWN.
ONLY TEN OF YOU LEFT.

27:43.660 --> 27:44.820
WHO'S GONNA WIN THIS BABY?

27:44.860 --> 27:46.782
- DAD.

27:46.830 --> 27:48.923
- SHAWN, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

27:48.960 --> 27:50.860
- LOOK, GUS AND I ARE WORKING
ON A CASE,

27:50.900 --> 27:52.959
THE LIKES OF WHICH
OUR FIRM HAS NEVER SEEN.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.467
- THAT'S EVERY WEEK.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.468
WHAT'S TRULY EXTRAORDINARY IS
THIS TEST OF ENDURANCE.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.263
BOTH MIND AND BODY HAVE
TO BE VERY STRONG.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.663
VERY STRONG.

27:59.710 --> 28:01.234
- HERE YOU GO, DAD.
IT'S EVERYTHING YOU ASKED FOR.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.804
PLUS A COUPLE EXTRAS...

28:02.840 --> 28:06.105
- AWW, DADDY GOT A
CARE PACKAGE.

28:06.150 --> 28:08.118
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BREATH,
ZIELINSKI.

28:08.150 --> 28:09.242
- MUST BE YOUR BOY.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.282
KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR CHAKRAS,
EVERYBODY.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.118
- HE'S A 5'10"
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE,

28:14.160 --> 28:15.889
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR THAT

28:15.920 --> 28:17.888
MEAN-SPIRITED DAUGHTER
OF YOURS.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.352
- WHAT DOES MY HEIGHT
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

28:19.390 --> 28:21.529
- SHE'S AN UNCOMPROMISING CHEF.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.528
- SHE MAKES SANDWICHES
AT SUB-ZERO,

28:23.560 --> 28:25.699
AND SHE REFUSES TO HEAR ME
WHEN I SAY "NO MAYO."

28:25.730 --> 28:27.493
- [chuckles] THAT'S MY GIRL.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.498
- DAD, AM I SENSING
A BITTER HISTORY BETWEEN YOU

28:29.540 --> 28:32.134
AND SAM ELLIOTT'S
YOUNGER BROTHER HARLAND?

28:32.170 --> 28:34.274
- HE'S MY OLD NEMESIS
FROM THE FORCE, SHAWN.

28:34.310 --> 28:35.868
BUTCH ZIELINSKI.
I TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT HIM.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.468
HE USED TO STEP ON MY TOES,
STEAL MY THUNDER.

28:37.510 --> 28:38.875
- YOU COULD TAKE HIM,
MR. SPENCER.

28:38.910 --> 28:40.138
- THANK YOU, GUSTER.
- AGREED.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.477
NOW, THE GUY WE'RE WORKING FOR

28:41.520 --> 28:42.544
THINKS HE'S A WEREWOLF.

28:42.580 --> 28:44.184
- WHIP SOME GARLIC
AT HIM, SHAWN.

28:44.220 --> 28:46.518
- THAT'S FOR VAMPIRES.
- THAT'S ALL I GOT.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.415
LOOK, I SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD
ANY DISTRACT IONS.

28:48.460 --> 28:52.089
TODAY IS ALL ABOUT
ME, ME, ME...

28:52.130 --> 28:54.098
AND THAT HEMI V-8, WHICH,
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW,

28:54.130 --> 28:57.497
CHURNS OUT AN ASTONISHING
390 HORSEPOWER, GUSTER.

28:57.530 --> 29:00.465
CAN'T YOU SMELL IT?
- I DRIVE AN ECHO.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.264
- ALL RIGHT...
[clears throat]

29:03.300 --> 29:04.858
HERE'S A FEW FREEBIES.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.060
CASEY KASEM HERE
WITH THE MANICURE,

29:07.110 --> 29:08.236
CLEARLY NOT A TRUCK GUY.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.577
YOU KNOW HE'S
EARLY-EXIT FODDER.

29:09.610 --> 29:11.475
WOMAN BY THE SIDE MIRROR
IS A GERMAPHOBE.

29:11.510 --> 29:13.398
SNEEZE IN HER GENERAL
DIRECTION, SHE'S OUT OF HERE.

29:13.450 --> 29:14.815
AND THE YOUNG BUCK
STARING ACROSS THE BED

29:14.850 --> 29:16.579
AT MOUNDS MCCLINTOCK THERE

29:16.620 --> 29:18.281
WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN
TO TAKE HIS HANDS

29:18.320 --> 29:20.788
OFF THE HARD BODY,
AND PUT IT ON THE SOFT ONE.

29:20.820 --> 29:24.824
- I'LL BE DAMNED.
I DIDN'T CLOCK THE GERMAPHOBE.

29:24.860 --> 29:26.919
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
HIGH FIVE.

29:26.960 --> 29:30.726
JUST KIDDING.
FOCUS.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.398
GO GET 'EM, POP.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.691
WAIT FOR IT.

29:37.740 --> 29:39.560
WAIT FOR IT.
- SHAWN...

29:39.610 --> 29:41.271
YOU TOOK A PICTURE
OF THE MAN'S SCHEDULE.

29:41.310 --> 29:42.971
THERE'S NOTHING IMPRESSIVE
ABOUT KNOWING ROUGHLY

29:43.010 --> 29:44.079
WHEN HE'S EXITING
THE BUILDING.

29:44.110 --> 29:46.601
- * WAIT FOR IT

29:46.650 --> 29:49.847
BOOM.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.584
[clears throat]

29:59.690 --> 30:00.827
LET'S DO THIS.

30:00.860 --> 30:03.397
- DO WHAT?
WE STILL DON'T HAVE A PLAN YET.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.161
- WOULD YOU STOP BEING
A BABY?

30:08.200 --> 30:09.929
WE JUST HAVE TO STASH OURSELVES
SOMEPLACE INCONSPICUOUS

30:09.970 --> 30:11.403
UNTIL MYRTLE LEAVES.

30:12.740 --> 30:15.231
- DUDE, WE'RE MEN.
HOW'S THAT NOT OBVIOUS?

30:15.280 --> 30:16.633
- MYRTLE IS A WOMAN, SHAWN.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.807
IF SHE HAS TO USE THE BATHROOM,
SHE'S COMING IN HERE.

30:18.850 --> 30:22.115
[door opens]

30:32.090 --> 30:34.320
- THINK YOU'RE READY
FOR THIS NIGHT TRAIN,

30:34.360 --> 30:36.351
JOHNNY MURDOCK?

30:36.400 --> 30:39.995
[zips purse]
THINK AGAIN.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.602
- [whispering] DUDE, YOU WISH
YOU WERE JOHNNY MURDOCK.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.938
- SHUT UP, SHAWN!

30:46.970 --> 30:49.109
- NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
THE SWISS!

30:49.140 --> 30:51.040
- I WAS UNDERESTIMATING YOU,
SHAWN.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.741
NOW, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR,
EXACTLY?

30:52.780 --> 30:54.645
- POLEXIA'S FILE.

30:54.680 --> 30:58.446
AND ANY SNACKS
YOU CAN FIND.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.718
-AAH!

30:59.750 --> 31:01.684
- LET'S JUST PRETEND
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.688
- FOR THE RECORD,
I'M ONLY DOING THIS

31:03.720 --> 31:05.859
BECAUSE STEWART MIGHT
BE INNOCENT.

31:05.890 --> 31:07.027
MIGHT.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.288
- WELL, THAT AND YOU WANT
TO HAVE

31:08.330 --> 31:10.855
A HALF-BLACK FAIRUZA BALK BABY
WITH HIS SISTER.

31:10.900 --> 31:14.336
QUESTION IS,
WHATEVER WILL YOU NAME IT?

31:14.370 --> 31:16.861
- WELL, IF IT'S A GIRL,
LAVENDER, OF COURSE.

31:16.900 --> 31:20.301
IF IT'S A BOY,
DEANDRE PRIDE GUSTER.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.331
DUDE.
- WHAT?

31:22.380 --> 31:25.304
- POLEXIA'S FILE IS GONE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "GONE"?

31:25.350 --> 31:26.999
- MEANING THERE'S A TAB HERE
THAT SAYS "POLEXIA LI,"

31:27.050 --> 31:28.312
BUT THE FILE IS GONE.

31:28.350 --> 31:30.944
- THAT'S A MAJOR BUMMER.
GIMME THE SWISS.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.709
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
STEW'S FILE.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.456
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

31:35.490 --> 31:38.789
HERE IT IS.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.549
LET'S SEE, UH...

31:41.600 --> 31:43.898
"I FEAR THAT STEWART'S
CONDITION IS WORSENING.

31:43.930 --> 31:45.568
"HE'S COMPLETELY RAVAGED
BY DELUSIONS

31:45.600 --> 31:50.537
AND UNCONTROLLABLE
HOMICIDAL IMPULSES."

31:55.480 --> 31:57.675
- GUS, I DON'T THINK
SHE WAS WEARING UNDERWEAR.

31:57.710 --> 31:59.701
- "HE MAY POSE A GRAVE DANGER
TO HIMSELF AND OTHERS.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.344
"I'M AFRAID THERE'S ONLY
ONE RECOURSE.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.642
"HE MUST BE COMMITTED
TO A FULL-TIME

32:03.680 --> 32:05.386
PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY."

32:05.420 --> 32:08.150
SHAWN, ARE YOU HEARING THIS?

32:08.190 --> 32:10.055
DR. TUCKER WROTE THIS
AT STEWART'S LAST SESSION.

32:10.090 --> 32:11.648
WE HAVE TO GO.
WILLOW'S IN GRAVE DANGER.

32:11.690 --> 32:13.578
- WAIT.
- WHAT?

32:13.630 --> 32:17.259
- DO THESE LOOK RIGHT TO YOU?

32:17.300 --> 32:18.767
- WELL, THE LABEL SAYS
HALOPERIDOL, BUT--

32:18.800 --> 32:20.028
- I KNEW IT!

32:20.070 --> 32:22.459
ONLY FOR THE LAST 11 SECONDS,
BUT STILL...

32:22.500 --> 32:24.263
WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE BOTTLE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:24.310 --> 32:27.609
HORSE TRANQUILIZERS, MAYBE.
- HORSE TRANQUILIZERS?

32:27.640 --> 32:28.777
WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT TAXIDERMY?

32:30.440 --> 32:32.146
I'M A PART OF THE LARGEST
CAMPAIGN ON THE INTERNET

32:32.180 --> 32:33.374
TO ABOLISH THE PRACTICE
COMPLETELY.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.672
- COULD THAT OWL HAVE COST
FIVE GRAND?

32:34.720 --> 32:35.971
- NO WAY.
- WHAT ABOUT THE BEAVER?

32:36.020 --> 32:37.442
- NO BEAVER IS WORTH
THAT MUCH, SHAWN.

32:37.480 --> 32:38.788
IT WOULD TAKE A MUCH
LARGER GAME.

32:38.820 --> 32:41.050
A MOOSE HEAD,
OR POSSIBLY A COUGAR.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.581
OR--OR A GRAY WOLF.

32:43.620 --> 32:47.078
OH, NO...IT'S NEITHER STEWART
NOR POLEXIA.

32:47.130 --> 32:50.793
- EXACTLY. WE GOTTA GET BACK
TO OCCULTOPUSS.

32:55.800 --> 32:56.835
- WILLOW!

32:56.870 --> 32:59.134
- BLACK MAGIC.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

32:59.170 --> 33:01.229
- PLEASE TELL US STEW IS
STILL HERE.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.339
- OKAY, I KNOW THAT YOU SAID
TO WAIT FOR YOU GUYS

33:03.380 --> 33:04.642
TO GET BACK,

33:04.680 --> 33:06.602
BUT DR. KEN TUCKER CAME BY,
AND HE WAS VERY GRIM.

33:06.650 --> 33:09.744
HE SAID THAT STEWART MIGHT TRY
TO HARM HIMSELF, AND/OR ME,

33:09.780 --> 33:11.611
AND THE HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNEW HOW TO HELP HIM.

33:11.650 --> 33:13.015
- WAIT, YOU LET DR. KEN TUCKER
TAKE YOUR BROTHER?

33:13.050 --> 33:14.017
- YES.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.254
- NO.
- I'M SORRY.

33:15.290 --> 33:17.155
DR. TUCKER HAS BEEN
LOOKING AFTER STEW

33:17.190 --> 33:19.021
FOR OVER A YEAR.
I JUST MET YOU GUYS TODAY!

33:19.060 --> 33:20.482
- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, SHAWN?

33:22.260 --> 33:24.694
- IT MEANS SOMEBODY'S
ABOUT TO DIE.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.991
[coyote howls]

33:34.980 --> 33:36.333
- [quietly]
PERSONAL ADDRESS...

33:36.380 --> 33:38.075
- I KNOW, SHAWN.
I SAID I'VE GOT IT.

33:38.110 --> 33:39.441
- WELL, FIND IT.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.619
- SOMEBODY WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

33:41.650 --> 33:43.971
- [quietly]
119 LINCOLNWOOD PLACE.

33:44.020 --> 33:47.285
- 119 LINCOLNWOOD PLACE.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.753
- SWEET. JULIET,
WRITE THAT DOWN.

33:48.790 --> 33:51.725
- THIS WOMAN, POLEXIA LI,
IS TONIGHT'S UNLUCKY VICTIM.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.022
- I KNOW POLEXIA.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.789
- WASN'T THAT ANNA PAQUIN'S
NAME IN ALMOST FAMOUS ?

33:54.830 --> 33:56.388
- ANNA PAQUIN WAS IN
ALMOST FAMOUS?

33:56.430 --> 33:58.625
- 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE SEEING HIM ANYMORE.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.889
I'M NOT SURE ANYONE WILL,
ACTUALLY. CAPICHE?

34:01.940 --> 34:04.408
- YES! AND SHE WAS HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH DR. KEN TUCKER.

34:04.440 --> 34:07.364
NOT ANNA PAQUIN, POLEXIA.
SHE WAS HIS PATIENT.

34:07.410 --> 34:09.298
HE TRIED TO END IT,
AND SHE WENT BALLISTIC.

34:09.340 --> 34:11.444
SO SHE'S GONNA SPILL THE BEANS
AND COST HIM HIS MARRIAGE.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.573
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I SUSPECT,

34:13.610 --> 34:15.612
HIS THRIVING PRACTICE,
AND HE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

34:15.650 --> 34:19.086
WORST OF ALL, HE'S
METHODICALLY SET UP STEWART

34:19.120 --> 34:20.417
TO TAKE THE FALL.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.657
- HOW?
- IT'LL SOUND RIDICULOUS.

34:22.690 --> 34:23.850
IT MAKES MORE SENSE
TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT,

34:23.890 --> 34:25.426
AND THEN LET ME DO MY THING--
TRUST ME.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.257
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?

34:27.290 --> 34:28.450
- YOU WROTE DOWN
WHERE SHE LIVES.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.058
SHE TENDS BAR AT SHANGRI-LALA'S
ON STATE STREET.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.362
IT'S A 15-BLOCK RADIUS.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.095
SHE COULD BE AT EITHER PLACE
OR ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN

34:33.130 --> 34:36.293
BECAUSE...THE BUSES
STOPPED RUNNING AN HOUR AGO,

34:36.340 --> 34:37.898
SO I'M GETTING
A VERY SERIOUS VIBE

34:37.940 --> 34:39.009
THAT SHE WALKS HOME FROM WORK.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.065
- FINE, YOU TWO HIT
SHANGRI-LALA'S,

34:41.110 --> 34:42.077
AND WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE REST. LET'S GO.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.077
- I'M COMING TOO.
- NO.

34:43.110 --> 34:44.099
- I'M RIDING SHOTGUN!

35:01.260 --> 35:02.955
[tires screech]

35:13.840 --> 35:16.570
- [sneezes]

35:16.610 --> 35:18.942
- OH, WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

35:18.980 --> 35:21.778
IT IS DOWN TO BUTCH AND HENRY,
MANO A MANO.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.158
- EXCUSE ME.
WHERE'S POLEXIA?

35:32.190 --> 35:33.953
- SHE FELT SICK,
SO I LET HER GO.

35:36.730 --> 35:40.063
- POLEXIA!

35:40.100 --> 35:43.035
[cell phone ringing]
SPENCER.

35:43.070 --> 35:45.129
STRIKE TWO, THEN.
SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT HERE.

35:45.170 --> 35:46.535
LET'S ROLL.
YES, I HAVE THE RIGHT ADDRESS.

35:46.570 --> 35:47.969
IT'S THE ONE YOU DIVINED!

35:50.980 --> 35:53.403
[rustling]

35:53.450 --> 35:57.477
- HELLO?
HELLO, IS SOMEONE THERE?

36:01.590 --> 36:04.582
[bushes rustling]

36:20.910 --> 36:22.730
[cocks gun]

36:30.420 --> 36:32.388
- HELLO?

36:36.590 --> 36:39.423
- HEY, I HAVE MACE!

36:43.230 --> 36:46.358
- POLEXIA.
- [gasp5]

36:46.400 --> 36:48.368
OH, YOU JUST ABOUT GAVE ME
A HEART ATTACK,

36:48.400 --> 36:49.867
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

36:49.900 --> 36:51.231
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:51.270 --> 36:54.205
- I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING SO INSENSITIVE.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.879
- YEAH, IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.344
- NO, IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
WE CAN WORK IT OUT.

36:59.380 --> 37:02.247
I LOVE MY WIFE,
BUT I REALLY DO ENJOY

37:02.280 --> 37:03.269
HAVING SEX WITH YOU.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.981
- [laughs]

37:05.020 --> 37:07.318
THAT'S THE BEST YOU'VE GOT?

37:07.350 --> 37:08.988
PRETTY SOON,
EVERYONE WILL KNOW

37:09.020 --> 37:10.783
JUST HOW PATHETIC
YOU REALLY ARE.

37:10.820 --> 37:13.948
- I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.958
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO END
THIS WAY.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.888
- AAH!
- FREEZE!

37:17.930 --> 37:19.727
SBPD.
HANDS IN THE AIR!

37:19.770 --> 37:21.328
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SHE'S VERY SICK.

37:21.370 --> 37:23.668
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.338
AND WOMAN TO WOMAN,

37:25.370 --> 37:28.407
IT'S TIME TO IXNAY
THIS SHORTCUT.

37:29.610 --> 37:32.408
- WAY TO BE, PARTNER! PUT
YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.145
- CHECK UP THERE.

37:34.180 --> 37:36.148
GREAT WORK
FROM THE WHOLE TEAM!

37:36.180 --> 37:38.489
HE'S BOUND TO HAVE STEW
STASHED UP THERE SOMEWHERE.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.589
- WHAT IS THIS?

37:39.620 --> 37:40.746
I HAVEN'T SEEN STEWART
IN OVER A WEEK.

37:40.790 --> 37:42.280
- [shouting]
I'VE GOT STEW!

37:42.320 --> 37:44.720
- THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLY FAST.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.523
- WHAT THE HELL KIND
OF SICK CHARADE

37:46.560 --> 37:48.949
WERE YOU PLANNING
OUT HERE, TUCKER?

37:55.070 --> 37:56.230
- SHAWN...

37:57.670 --> 37:59.206
- YOU SEE...

37:59.240 --> 38:01.333
HE COULDN'T JUST KILL POLEXIA
IN COLD BLOOD.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.234
SHE WAS BOUND TO HAVE
TOLD SOMEONE ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.204
HE NEEDED A PATSY,
AND IN WALKS STEW.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.718
OVER THE EDGE AND CONVINCED
HE'D BEEN BITTEN BY A WEREWOLF.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.844
EVIL BLACK LIGHT BULB
GOES OFF.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.450
FIRST, DR. KEN TUCKER
GAVE STEW THE WRONG DRUGS

38:14.490 --> 38:16.310
TO ENSURE THAT HE'D BE PASSED
OUT AT THE WITCHING HOUR.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.181
THE NEXT NIGHT,
HE WALTZED INTO OUR OFFICE,

38:19.230 --> 38:20.857
WHERE WE SLEPT UNDER
WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS

38:20.890 --> 38:22.994
THE BLANKET OF PROTECTION
A DOUBLE-BOLT LOCK PROVIDES.

38:23.030 --> 38:24.019
- YOU NEVER LOCK THE DOOR.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.994
- HE SMASHED OUR WINDOW,
STOLE STEW,

38:26.030 --> 38:28.362
AND KILLED TWO GRIZZLED HUNTERS
WITH AN INJECTION

38:28.400 --> 38:31.096
OF SOMETHING I PRESUME
IS UNTRACEABLE.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.404
THEN HE ACTUALLY PROCEEDED
TO WOLF THEM UP,

38:33.440 --> 38:35.499
USING THE TASTELESSLY
MUMMIFIED CLAWS

38:35.540 --> 38:38.077
OF THE BEASTLY PELT THAT
I NOW WEAR ON MY HEAD

38:38.110 --> 38:40.670
AS A TRIBUTE TO ITS POWER
AND GRACE.

38:40.710 --> 38:43.645
- IT'S AN AWFUL ACT --
TAXIDERMY!

38:43.680 --> 38:45.944
AND, OF COURSE,
THE MURDER THING TOO.

38:47.650 --> 38:50.255
- AND FINALLY, HE BRANDED STEW
WITH A PENTAGRAM,

38:50.290 --> 38:53.589
AND LEFT HIM UNCONSCIOUS
AT THE SCENE.

38:53.630 --> 38:56.997
ALL LEADING TO TONIGHT,
WHEN HE WOULD KILL POLEXIA

38:57.030 --> 38:59.498
AND LET POOR STEWART CONFESS
TO EVERYTHING.

38:59.530 --> 39:01.168
- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I ONLY WENT INTO THE WOODS

39:01.200 --> 39:02.633
TO KILL A DEER.

39:02.670 --> 39:04.706
THE HUNTERS WERE A MERE CRIME
OF OPPORTUNITY.

39:04.740 --> 39:06.002
A HAPPY ACCIDENT.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.679
- OH. THAT'S WORTH
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

39:09.710 --> 39:12.975
- YOU'RE THE SICKEST
OF US ALL.

39:13.010 --> 39:16.514
- WELL, SPENCER, I GUESS
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO YOU.

39:16.550 --> 39:17.972
OF COURSE, NO ONE ELSE
WOULD HAVE EITHER, SO...

39:18.020 --> 39:19.544
- DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE GONNA
PAY FOR OUR WINDOW?

39:19.590 --> 39:23.048
- [chuckles] YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT'S RICH.

39:23.090 --> 39:24.387
- UHH...

39:26.930 --> 39:29.899
- GUS GAVE THEM TO ME.
JUST IN CASE.

39:29.930 --> 39:32.228
- OF COURSE HE DID.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.465
- GOOD THINKING.

39:34.500 --> 39:37.469
- YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO SAFE.

39:40.110 --> 39:42.374
- STEW.

39:42.410 --> 39:44.901
STEW.

39:47.210 --> 39:50.179
- WHERE AM I?

39:50.220 --> 39:52.108
I FEEL LIKE A BABY.

39:52.150 --> 39:55.017
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE WEARING
A DIAPER.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.482
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY,
BIG BRO.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.612
THANKS TO THESE GUYS.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.628
HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY
REPAY YOU?

39:59.660 --> 40:01.389
- MAYBE YOU AND BLACK MAGIC
HERE COULD GET TOGETHER

40:01.430 --> 40:04.319
AND DO SOME CAULDRON STIRRING
SOMETIME.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.920
- I'D LOVE TO.
- SOUNDS GOOD.

40:06.970 --> 40:09.939
- I THINK WE SHOULD ALL
GO OUT AND CELEBRATE.

40:09.970 --> 40:13.406
AS SOON AS I AM NOT
NAKED ANYMORE.

40:13.440 --> 40:15.032
all: AGREED.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.646
- YOU'RE RUTH LESS,
HENRY.

40:25.690 --> 40:29.387
YOU ARE STRONG OF MIND,
BUT MEAN OF HEART.

40:29.420 --> 40:31.308
- WE REAP WHAT WE SOW,
ZIELINSKI.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.123
TIME TO PAY THE PIPER.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.720
- MY PLIGHT IS NOBLE, HENRY.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.866
THIS VEHICLE'S NOT FOR ME,
BUT FOR THE PARENTLESS CHILDREN

40:38.900 --> 40:41.994
OF ST. THOMAS OF THE APOSTLES
ORPHANAGE OF GOLETA.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.496
- OH, COME ON.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.428
- DUDE.
- OH...

40:51.480 --> 40:53.175
- WHERE DID--
- LOOK.

40:53.210 --> 40:56.179
IT'S LIKE PIPPI LONGSTOCKING'S
LITTLE SISTER,

40:56.220 --> 40:58.040
PATCH ES LONGSTOCKING.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.446
- YOU DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE
THE ORPHAN TYPE, BUTCH.

41:00.490 --> 41:02.856
- AS AN INFANT,
AFTER I WAS ABANDONED

41:02.890 --> 41:05.757
AND LEFT LAKESIDE, ONLY TO BE
FOUND BY BIG-FLY FISHERMEN,

41:05.790 --> 41:08.850
IT WAS THE FINE SISTERS
OF ST. THOMAS OF THE APOSTLES

41:08.900 --> 41:12.028
THAT RAISED THE MAN
YOU SEE BEFORE YOU TODAY.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.992
AND WHEN THAT OLD STATION WAGON
CAUGHT FIRE

41:14.030 --> 41:15.895
AND THE KIDS DIDN'T HAVE
NEW WHEELS

41:15.940 --> 41:17.589
TO TAKE 'EM
ON THEIR FIELD TRIPS,

41:17.640 --> 41:22.134
I SAID, "BUTCH...
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOTTA DO."

41:22.180 --> 41:23.579
SO HERE I AM.

41:23.610 --> 41:25.601
IT'S BIGGER THAN US, HENRY.

41:25.650 --> 41:26.947
AND DON'T WORRY, I'M GONNA
HAVE THIS THING FITTED

41:26.980 --> 41:30.848
WITH A CUSTOM CAMPER SO THE
KIDS CAN'T FALL OFF THE BACK

41:30.880 --> 41:33.383
ONTO THE FREEWAY
AT HIGH SPEEDS.

41:47.370 --> 41:48.928
YEAH! YEAH!

41:48.970 --> 41:51.530
[cheering]

41:51.570 --> 41:54.437
YEAH! YEAH!

41:54.470 --> 41:55.437
- DAD, ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

41:55.480 --> 41:56.833
YOU JUST GAVE UP
YOUR DREAM MACHINE

41:56.880 --> 41:58.370
TO A GUY YOU SAID YOU PUNCHED
ONCE IN A BOWLING ALLEY.

41:58.410 --> 41:59.638
- HE BROUGHT A NUN, SHAWN!

41:59.680 --> 42:01.545
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA
GIVE ONE UP FOR THE TEAM.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.468
- YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, SHAWN,
THOSE WERE SOME CUTE KIDS.

42:03.520 --> 42:06.045
- NO DOUBT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD,

42:06.090 --> 42:08.012
THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY
NICE THING YOU JUST DID.

42:08.050 --> 42:09.312
YOU OUGHT TO BE PROUD
OF YOURSELF.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.510
- I'M TIRED.
I WANT WAFFLES.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.050
- I COULD EAT SOME WAFFLES.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.058
- I'M BUYING.
- WHICH MEANS I'M BUYING.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.749
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.
