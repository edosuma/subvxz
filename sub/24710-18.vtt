03:43.556 --> 03:46.726
the gun may have been placed

buying the suicide angle

07:32.660 --> 07:34.203
(INHALES) Uh. The other night
when he was leaving,

07:34.370 --> 07:36.956
he stopped me on the stairs,
and he called me the name Rocky Marciano,

-Marciano was.
-...of the fifties.

A... and as the conversation went on,
I realized his calling me that

07:44.213 --> 07:47.216
was an indirect reference
to my having punched Malcolm Cullinan.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.221

07:53.264 --> 07:54.765
He said I had nothing to fear from him,

07:55.016 --> 07:57.059
but not to think that meant
I didn't have anything to fear.

who Mike's talking about.

but he's talking about Cullinan.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.027

Not when you were providing drugs
to that girlfriend you were banging.

She was a junkie informant.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.782
We were in love.

I believe that girl took her own life
in remorse over you, didn't she, Mike?

13:49.662 --> 13:52.748
And you were dismissed
off the job, disgraced.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.334
I resigned, and I wanna know
how you're privy to this.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.962

the two of you were steadies?

What kind of name is Trent?

It's been in my family a while.

31:43.443 --> 31:47.155

and I deeply resent being yanked in here
coming out of a film.

31:52.827 --> 31:57.290
Then you shouldn't have written the movie
you went to on a post-it note,

31:57.498 --> 32:01.252
so that when we collared
your asshole buddy in your apartment,

32:01.461 --> 32:04.005
we'd know where to grab you up. Huh?

32:04.505 --> 32:07.342
I think what I'll do is ask for a lawyer.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.093
No. I'll demand a lawyer.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.429
ANDY: Yeah. Let's get you a lawyer, Trent.

32:11.804 --> 32:15.600
So, instead of you givin' us, like,
three sentences of simple explanation

32:15.683 --> 32:18.019
that could get you out havin' cappuccino,

32:18.227 --> 32:21.064
you can be charged accessory
to attempted murder.

there's no toilet paper for after.

32:28.571 --> 32:31.950
I don't know what Mal Cullinan
was doing in my apartment. I wasn't there.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.744
What'd he do, put a gun to your head
and force you out into the street?

32:36.329 --> 32:38.039
Mal Cullinan...

32:39.165 --> 32:41.084
told me in a general way...

32:42.543 --> 32:44.504
-No. Let me rephrase that.
-Please.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.756
He didn't tell me anything...

32:47.924 --> 32:49.467
about tonight specifically.

32:50.218 --> 32:53.513
We had a general understanding
that he would sometimes

32:53.596 --> 32:55.306
use my apartment...

32:56.516 --> 32:58.434
and I gave him an extra key.

that I might be just a little bit nervous?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.746
(SCOFFS) Is he gonna cry?

33:19.247 --> 33:22.041
Trent, just give us a couple
straightforward answers.

No one wants to make you nervous
or upset or anything else.

-Well, he makes me nervous.

-That's nothing to be ashamed of.

trying to intimidate me for 30 seconds...

I don't got a second job,
nor even a first one just now.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.405
How'd that happen?

40:51.073 --> 40:52.074
I don't know.

40:52.658 --> 40:53.659
You tell me.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.287
What are you talking about, anyway?

41:07.715 --> 41:10.384
(CHUCKLES)
I guess I got somewhat of a crush on you,

41:11.260 --> 41:14.763
and I quit my job,
hoping you'd hire me. (CHUCKLES)

41:15.890 --> 41:18.017
Well, I'm flattered,
but it's a little slow

41:18.100 --> 41:19.810
with my shingle just up.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.773
You were always very truthful, Mike.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.359
You know, a lot of times, you...

41:28.235 --> 41:31.155
haven't got even a vague idea
what you're doin'.

41:31.530 --> 41:34.408
-Hmm.
-This is the first thing I've attempted.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.453
I was sittin' here...

41:38.496 --> 41:40.039
hoping a case begins.

41:52.259 --> 41:55.471
Maybe I'll be your lucky charm,
'cause I believe in you.

41:57.264 --> 41:58.516
You got shortcomings,

41:59.350 --> 42:02.603
but I've always known
you're trying to be a good person.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.774
(INHALES) I hope to be
an encouragement to you

42:07.024 --> 42:08.526
just sittin' at my desk.

42:10.402 --> 42:13.364
I guess everyone needs someone
to believe in them

42:13.447 --> 42:14.865
at the beginning of things.

42:19.995 --> 42:21.121
I'll believe in you...

42:22.289 --> 42:24.083
even when you don't believe in yourself.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.962
You definitely add to the furnishings.

42:36.053 --> 42:40.724
MIKE: <i>Use her to encourage the detective.</i>
<i>Uh. She can help him out, give him advice.</i>

42:41.058 --> 42:42.184
<i>You know, keep him going.</i>

42:43.310 --> 42:44.937
<i>She'll always cheer him up.</i>

42:46.564 --> 42:48.274
<i>Everyone likes a beautiful broad.</i>

42:50.651 --> 42:52.403
<i>Maybe I can do this.</i>

43:17.428 --> 43:20.389
