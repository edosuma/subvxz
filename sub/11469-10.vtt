38:34.930 --> 38:36.731
Hey, Harry.
Can I have your car?

38:36.899 --> 38:38.900
You know,
just till you get back.

38:41.335 --> 38:42.904
So, what are you
gonna do now, Harry?

38:42.970 --> 38:45.139
Go see my daughter.

38:45.239 --> 38:47.941
Put this place
in my rear view.

39:04.924 --> 39:07.358
[ Engine turns over ]

39:07.458 --> 39:09.227
[ Siren wailing ]

40:32.501 --> 40:34.369
[ Cellphone rings ]

40:36.937 --> 40:39.207
Miss me already?

40:52.818 --> 40:54.220
Inside.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.426
He's clear.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.301
Delacroix
called it in himself.

41:11.401 --> 41:13.570
He was waiting for us
when he showed up.

41:13.670 --> 41:15.139
Reporter called him,

41:15.239 --> 41:17.041
told him Stokes is gonna
skate on Arthur's murder,

41:17.074 --> 41:19.143
told him
about this place.

41:19.242 --> 41:20.709
So, delacroix was waiting here
for him this morning.

41:20.809 --> 41:23.346
Popped him
when he came downstairs.

41:27.250 --> 41:29.384
Harry, don't.
I'm cool.

41:35.090 --> 41:38.059
You think this absolves you
of anything?

41:38.159 --> 41:41.928
I did
what you couldn't do.

41:42.063 --> 41:43.597
Billets: Bosch.

41:43.697 --> 41:45.299
Bosch!

41:45.399 --> 41:47.933
Get out of here, Harry, now.

41:48.068 --> 41:49.269
You were suspended.
The last thing I need

41:49.369 --> 41:50.703
is you getting caught up
in this clusterfuck.

41:50.803 --> 41:52.405
I'm going.

41:52.505 --> 41:53.773
Good.
Walk him.

41:53.873 --> 41:56.608
Harry, leave this one alone.

41:56.708 --> 41:58.243
There's nothing
we could've done about it.

41:58.343 --> 42:00.645
Exactly delacroix's point.
We did nothing.

42:00.745 --> 42:03.315
The rain will come along,
wash all this shit away.

42:03.415 --> 42:07.085
Right. All in to the big
gutter and out to sea.

42:07.118 --> 42:09.087
Go easy, brother.

42:22.264 --> 42:25.301
* rain, rain, rain

42:25.401 --> 42:29.238
* wicked rain
falling from the sky *

42:32.107 --> 42:35.110
* down, down, down

42:35.176 --> 42:38.746
* pouring down upon the night

42:40.580 --> 42:43.650
* well, there's just one chance
in a million *

42:43.750 --> 42:49.222
* that someday
we'll make it out alive *

42:51.324 --> 42:54.193
* rain, rain, rain

42:54.293 --> 42:57.929
* the evil rain
falling all the time *

42:58.029 --> 43:00.898
[ thunder rumbling ]

43:00.998 --> 43:03.468
* sun, sun, sun

43:03.568 --> 43:07.404
* sun don't ever want to shine

43:09.540 --> 43:12.243
* well, there'll be no light
in the morning *

43:12.343 --> 43:16.812
* till some peace
at last we find *

43:19.649 --> 43:24.453
* like travelers in the
darkness, can't see our way *

43:24.553 --> 43:29.158
* tryin' hard to make it
through another day *

43:29.258 --> 43:32.194
* fa, fa, father

43:32.294 --> 43:37.165
* why do you let your sons
go astray? *

43:39.200 --> 43:41.902
* bro, bro, brother

43:42.002 --> 43:45.538
* why must we go on this way?

43:48.208 --> 43:51.043
* there's a storm up
in the distance *

43:51.178 --> 43:55.447
* and it looks like
it's here to stay *

44:30.978 --> 44:33.881
* rain, rain, rain

44:38.219 --> 44:41.522
* rain, rain, rain, rain, rain
