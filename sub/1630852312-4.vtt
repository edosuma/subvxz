- Good golly.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.021
- She take insurance?
- She sure does.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.458
- So you're telling me
I can chop it up

07:38.501 --> 07:41.504
with this woman right here,
compliments of A-etna?

07:41.548 --> 07:43.550
Maybe therapy
ain't so bad after all.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.073
- All right, calm down, y'all.
Noah,

07:45.116 --> 07:46.814
you shouldn't be attracted
to your therapist.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.206
Don't you think that
that can maybe get in the way

07:48.250 --> 07:49.381
of you being real with her?

07:49.425 --> 07:51.122
- Oh, I got real.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.602
- So how are you feeling today?

07:52.646 --> 07:55.823
- 100% perfect.
No issues whatsoever.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.302
That was real.

07:57.346 --> 08:00.001
Look, I did feel perfect
just by her presence.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.916
- My point is
therapy can't help you

08:01.959 --> 08:04.179
with your choking issue
if you don't take it seriously.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.529
You need a therapist
where you can focus on yourself

08:06.573 --> 08:10.533
and not their looks,
like with my therapist.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.709
- Bro, he looks just like you.
- He does?

08:12.753 --> 08:15.059
Huh.
I don't see it.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.931
All I see
is a normal, pleasant man

08:16.974 --> 08:19.281
who I have zero
romantic tension with.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.762
- So therapy is just you
talking to yourself

08:21.805 --> 08:24.242
in the mirror?
Got it.

08:25.461 --> 08:27.419
- Ooh.
That was some good sex.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.073
- [chuckles]
- What was that move

08:29.117 --> 08:30.597
at the end?
It was crazy.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.294
- I call that
the [bleep] windmill.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.731
I just took my [bleep]
slightly past your [bleep]

08:34.775 --> 08:38.822
and then I [bleep]
while you [sustained bleep].

08:38.866 --> 08:40.868
You know...

08:40.911 --> 08:42.260
like a windmill.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.306
- That makes perfect sense
now that you explain it.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.090
Very nice.
- Yeah.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.439
- Oh, no.
Dang.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.398
Where's my phone?
- Hold up, I'll call it.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.008
- Okay.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.533
- ♪ Bow chicka wow-wow

08:53.576 --> 08:54.795
- Oh.
- ♪ Bow chicka--

08:54.838 --> 08:56.884
- "Sex Henry"?

08:56.927 --> 08:58.581
That's all I am to you?
- Yes.

08:58.625 --> 09:02.454
Oh, you want me to change it
to "Great Sex Henry."

09:02.498 --> 09:04.282
- Nah, I just thought
that we were something more.

09:04.326 --> 09:08.112
I mean, we did just hang out
on back-to-back nights.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.592
- Oh, no, the Code.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.073
- I tried to tell you.
So what happened?

09:12.116 --> 09:14.031
Are things done with you
and Sex Henry?

09:14.075 --> 09:15.598
- No, it's worse.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.339
We're exclusive now.

09:17.382 --> 09:20.124
- So Sex Henry is just Henry?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.126
- I think this is great.
- Noah thinks it's great.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.302
This is a disaster.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.174
Also,
Henry wants to go get dinner.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.523
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.004
TACS Code 12-Q--
never share a meal.

09:30.047 --> 09:33.573
That's one of the most
critical codes along with 12-Y.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.792
Never let them
meet your friends.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.881
- What then? I need to get him
back to casual status.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.143
You must have a code
for that.

09:39.187 --> 09:40.623
- Oh, now you want the Code?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.233
Everybody clowns on the Code
until they need it.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.191
But now--
- Just shut up!

09:43.234 --> 09:44.932
Just shut up and help me!

09:44.975 --> 09:47.151
- I'm sorry.
No man or woman has ever

09:47.195 --> 09:48.326
made it back to casual.

09:48.370 --> 09:49.980
- I can go back.
I will go back.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.416
- Back into his arms.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.070
- Ow!
- Hey, Fay!

09:53.114 --> 09:55.638
- Hey, Sherm.
- Nerve, nerve, nerve.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.597
Nerve is the word
for what you have.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.120
- It's happening.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.035
It's all unfolding
like we said it would.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.211
- Not so fast.
Tell me what happened.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.299
- Okay,
Tiff and I went out last night.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.474
Things were going well

10:05.517 --> 10:07.215
until we went back
to her place.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.434
[Tiff giggling]

10:09.478 --> 10:10.740
[thud]
[both scream]

10:10.784 --> 10:12.786
- I don't understand.
You had sex so good

10:12.829 --> 10:15.179
that you broke the bed?
How is that a problem?

10:15.223 --> 10:16.790
- The dope sex
wasn't the problem.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.531
But afterwards,
this woman had the gall

10:19.575 --> 10:22.186
to send me a Venmo request
for half the bedframe.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.188
Can you believe that?
- Wow.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.668
Are you really that cheap?
- I'm not cheap.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.844
I'm principled.
- Kristen and I break the bed

10:27.888 --> 10:29.411
at least twice a year.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.718
We take that as a sign of
how strong our relationship is.

10:31.761 --> 10:32.806
You should split the cost.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.547
- I agree.
If Henry asked me to pay,

10:35.591 --> 10:37.549
I would pay.
- 'Cause that's your man now.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.769
- Okay, quiet.
- All of y'all are children.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.641
And I'm a grown up, and I know

10:41.684 --> 10:43.512
I'm not the only person
that's had sex in that bed.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.296
Would you blame
one drop of rain

10:45.340 --> 10:47.429
on turning the whole
Statue of Liberty green?

10:47.472 --> 10:49.387
No!
- Fay, we tried to warn you.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.694
No matter
how genuine your efforts are,

10:51.738 --> 10:53.565
that man is impossible.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.959
- That's funny, because all
I see are two strong-headed,

10:56.003 --> 10:58.701
like-minded people
proving their compatibility.

10:58.745 --> 10:59.920
- You've gone mad.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.617
- Every genius has
to be a little crazy.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.401
That's how Bill Gates
invented texting.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.576
- So that's it?
We're just rewriting history

11:04.620 --> 11:06.100
on the whole Bill Gates thing--
cool.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.362
- Sherm,
you agree that everything was

11:07.405 --> 11:08.711
going great until this moment,
yes?

11:08.755 --> 11:10.974
- Yes.
We broke the bed with our sex.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.150
It was both scary
and delightful.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.848
- So then just
fix the bedframe.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.024
She gets her bed back,
you can still see each other,

11:17.067 --> 11:17.981
and you don't have
to pay any money.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.766
- No money.

11:19.809 --> 11:20.680
That's what I like to hear.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.594
- You cheap.
- Principled.

11:22.638 --> 11:25.510
- Oh, speaking of romantic
entanglements, Wyatt, question.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.861
What would it mean if
my beautiful therapist and I

11:27.904 --> 11:30.602
were ever to be
in the same social environment?

11:30.646 --> 11:33.257
- This again? Why even let
your mind go there?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.085
- Because my beautiful
therapist just walked

11:35.129 --> 11:37.697
into the bar, and now we're
in the same social environment.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.874
[smooth R&B beat]

11:40.917 --> 11:42.745
all: Damn!

11:42.789 --> 11:44.138
- Right?

11:46.053 --> 11:46.270
.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.185
- Whoo!
I cannot believe

11:48.229 --> 11:50.797
my therapist came to the bar.
That was nuts.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.102
- I think you're
making this a bigger deal

11:52.146 --> 11:53.538
than what it actually is.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.931
- Are you serious?
Did you even see what happened?

11:54.975 --> 11:57.673
- Noah, hi!
- Hey there!

11:57.717 --> 11:59.109
- So?
- Aren't they supposed to

11:59.153 --> 12:00.981
ignore you
when they see you in public?

12:01.024 --> 12:02.504
Isn't there some
law of silence?

12:02.547 --> 12:03.505
- What are you talking about?

12:03.548 --> 12:05.333
There is no law of silence.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.682
- Nah, I think Noah's right.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.944
Remember that scene
from "The Sopranos"

12:07.988 --> 12:09.685
when Tony sees Dr. Melfi
at that restaurant?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.208
- Yep.
She totally ignores him.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.644
- Yeah, but not by law.

12:12.688 --> 12:13.645
What if Dr. Ten-Out-of-Ten
Medicine Woman

12:13.689 --> 12:14.777
is actually into you?

12:14.821 --> 12:16.039
- I mean,
she was asking me a lot

12:16.083 --> 12:17.388
of personal questions
in the last session.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.477
- That's what therapists do.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.784
[mellow beat]

12:21.828 --> 12:25.309
[phone rings]

12:25.353 --> 12:26.876
- Nicky, what's good?
- Oh, I'm just calling

12:26.920 --> 12:29.357
to tell you that you need
to write an amendment

12:29.400 --> 12:31.620
to the Timeless Advice
for Casual Sex Code.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.013
- Oh, no.
What are you doing?

12:33.056 --> 12:35.189
- Doubling down.
The only way to get Henry back

12:35.232 --> 12:38.148
to cas is if I push
the commitment as far as I can

12:38.192 --> 12:40.411
to make him realize
how much better he had it.

12:40.455 --> 12:43.632
- Nicky, what you are talking
about is very high risk.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.503
If anything goes wrong,
you might end up

12:45.547 --> 12:47.418
in a fully
committed relationship.

12:47.462 --> 12:50.857
You might end up having
to introduce him to us.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.989
Us, Nicky, your friends.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.991
- That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.732
- Oh.
Hey, baby, what's all this?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.473
- Baby?
- Hi, honey.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.780
- Honey?
- I made dinner.

13:00.823 --> 13:01.911
- Dinner?
Oh, no, Nicky!

13:01.955 --> 13:04.522
Nicky, now--Nicky, no!

13:04.566 --> 13:06.742
[drill whirring]

13:06.786 --> 13:08.222
- All right.
See?

13:08.265 --> 13:10.659
Neither of us has to pay
for a new bedframe.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.139
It's good as new.
- Okay, cool.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.097
- Cool?
Can I get like a thank you?

13:14.141 --> 13:16.752
- I don't feel as though
I should have to say thank you

13:16.796 --> 13:18.928
when what I really wanted
was partial compensation

13:18.972 --> 13:21.844
for a new bedframe,
not shoddy handiwork.

13:21.888 --> 13:25.282
- Shoddy handiwork?
This bed is sturdy as hell.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.762
- We broke the bed together.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.068
That's a 50/50 act.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.244
Every pleasure has its price.
That's Socrates.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.768
- You think I don't know
Socrates when I hear him?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.163
Do not do to others what angers
you if done to you by others.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.078
Also Socrates.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.384
I would not make you pay
for a new bedframe,

13:40.428 --> 13:42.691
because I think you would
have a right to be upset.

13:42.734 --> 13:43.692
- Whatever.
You can pay for school,

13:43.735 --> 13:44.867
but you can't buy class.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.173
- That's a Jay-Z quote.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.827
Nothing you're saying
is going over my head.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.090
And for the record,
I didn't go to college.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.918
- Neither did I.

13:54.921 --> 13:58.881
- Oh, damn!
It's back on again.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.187
- Hey.
What's up, y'all?

14:00.230 --> 14:03.451
So things have escalated
with my hot therapist.

14:03.494 --> 14:04.800
She sent me a text.
- Ooh.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.802
- Damn.
What'd she say?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.282
- "Funny running
into you the other day.

14:08.325 --> 14:11.285
This made me think of you.
Smiley emoji."

14:12.634 --> 14:14.810
She's thinking of me.
- And she also sent you

14:14.854 --> 14:17.378
an article titled
"How to Open Up in Therapy."

14:17.421 --> 14:19.075
- Yeah,
but that smiley emoji though?

14:19.119 --> 14:20.642
- True.
- It's wild.

14:20.685 --> 14:21.773
- Yeah
- Noah, you want to go

14:21.817 --> 14:23.166
over by that window
really quick?

14:23.210 --> 14:24.298
I think I just saw
a really cool bird out there.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.735
- For real?
Yeah, I love birds.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.650
Where's the bird?
Did it fly away?

14:28.693 --> 14:30.913
Ugh,
the coolest ones always do.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.480
- There is no bird.
I'm confronting you.

14:32.523 --> 14:33.785
- What?

14:33.829 --> 14:35.439
Why would you lie about a bird?

14:35.483 --> 14:37.050
- I think all this stuff
about your hot therapist

14:37.093 --> 14:39.443
is you avoiding
your actual issue.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.489
- Are you kidding me?
How would you even know?

14:41.532 --> 14:43.186
- Did you talk to her
about your dating problems?

14:43.230 --> 14:44.709
- I'm not allowed to talk to
you about my therapy sessions.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.450
Patient-doctor confidentiality.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.235
- That's not how it works.
It's the other way around.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.106
- Who cares?
I'm in therapy.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.282
That's what you wanted.
Why are you being so uptight?

14:52.326 --> 14:53.849
- Because every time I try
to tell you something

14:53.893 --> 14:55.851
that you don't want to hear,
you immediately dismiss it.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.766
- That's not true.
- See, this is exactly

14:57.809 --> 14:59.333
how my therapist said
you might respond.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.030
- Oh, so you're talking
to your little evil twin

15:01.074 --> 15:02.118
and kee-keeing about me?
