00:06.000 --> 00:08.625
-<i>Previously on </i>The Recruit<i>:</i>
-Owen Hendricks.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.000
I need you back in Phoenix.

00:10.083 --> 00:12.041
-You're out, I'm done.
-<i>Not your decision.</i>

00:12.125 --> 00:16.125
Mr. Hendricks, I'm Kevin Mills,
chief of staff to the president.

00:17.541 --> 00:19.083
-Not Bob.
-Not here.

00:19.166 --> 00:21.500
Maxine Meladze said you were
one of her handlers.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.666
I've heard of her. She wasn't one of mine.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.500
-Someone is pretending to be you?
-Call me when you find something.

00:26.583 --> 00:29.458
Why is our former asset demanding
that you come back to Phoenix?

00:29.541 --> 00:31.666
Because I kept my promise
and got her out of prison?

00:31.750 --> 00:33.958
Go to Phoenix, bring her back. No drama.

00:34.041 --> 00:37.750
-Can I put a hotel room on your card?
-Sure.

00:37.833 --> 00:38.791
What's happening?

00:38.875 --> 00:40.708
You're right. Something's going on.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.166
Have you ever been in love?

00:42.250 --> 00:44.458
-Have you ever loved someone?
-Yes, my daughter.

00:44.541 --> 00:45.875
-Cut him off.
-The card?

00:45.958 --> 00:46.791
All of it.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.958
You walk two blocks north,
three blocks west.

00:49.041 --> 00:50.875
Talco will pick you up. You do the deal.

00:50.958 --> 00:54.958
I'm just here as a proxy to negotiate
the terms of the sale of Max's business.

00:55.041 --> 00:57.708
You're not making a deal with me.
You're making it with El Jefe.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.750
Man, I'm clearly in a train yard.
Is the hood really necessary?

01:24.833 --> 01:27.666
No. But it's fun to make you wear it.

01:29.541 --> 01:30.375
Come on.

02:10.958 --> 02:11.958
Over there.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.625
Let's get out of here.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.583
Not for you. Come on.

02:37.375 --> 02:38.208
Go on.

02:53.958 --> 02:56.708
I'm here to make the deal
on the safe houses.

02:56.791 --> 03:01.083
-You're Max's partner, right?
-Associate. We have a temporary alignment.

03:01.166 --> 03:04.083
$3 million.
Talco will pay you on the way out.

03:07.916 --> 03:09.791
Yeah, that's not gonna work for us.

03:09.875 --> 03:13.708
Okay, then tell him
to strangle you with his bare hands.

03:14.208 --> 03:17.208
Or just take your body back to Mexico
and hang it from a bridge. How's that?

03:20.250 --> 03:22.250
Uh, look, um...

03:24.333 --> 03:26.458
no offense,
but the price just went up to $7 million

03:26.541 --> 03:27.875
because you're being an asshole,

03:27.958 --> 03:30.666
and I had to wear a bag on my head
that smelled like Hot Cheetos.

03:30.750 --> 03:34.666
In fact, Talco out there is the one
that you should consider strangling

03:34.750 --> 03:38.083
for not communicating
how badly you need this deal.

03:43.916 --> 03:46.666
You see, I'm not just
selling Max's safe house business.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.375
If you stand up
and make a respectable deal,

03:50.125 --> 03:52.916
she will give you an inroad
to her operation in Eastern Europe.

03:53.958 --> 03:55.375
What operation?

03:56.416 --> 03:59.875
She's ex-Russian mafia, no?
Emphasis on the "ex."

04:01.416 --> 04:04.958
Ah. You don't think I do my homework
on who I'm doing businesses with?

04:07.000 --> 04:11.708
You're never ex-Russian mafia.
Just like you're never ex-Aquino Cartel.

04:14.458 --> 04:17.208
There's a powerplay coming
and Max is gonna end up on top.

04:19.416 --> 04:20.666
And if she doesn't?

04:22.041 --> 04:25.833
Well, then you're out
the equivalent of a rounding error

04:25.916 --> 04:27.875
on whatever it is
you cut your cocaine with.

04:28.583 --> 04:30.500
Look. Bottomline here,

04:31.000 --> 04:35.041
you have the opportunity
to get a foothold in a major new market

04:35.750 --> 04:38.125
if you make a healthy deal with Max.

04:39.791 --> 04:40.625
Okay.

04:41.875 --> 04:44.416
$7 million. What am I buying?

04:44.500 --> 04:47.625
A name of a banker
who's gonna feed you foreclosure houses

04:47.708 --> 04:52.125
and slow roll the paperwork so that
you can do whatever you want in them.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.291
Mm. What is the name?

04:55.875 --> 04:57.250
This is the risky part.

04:57.333 --> 05:01.458
Because I could just give you a name
and then you could kill me.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.291
Oh, right.

05:04.041 --> 05:07.250
See, you need to
stop thinking about time as linear.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.458
Do you understand that concept?

05:10.375 --> 05:13.958
What will happen
has already happened in the future, right?

05:14.583 --> 05:18.958
So in this moment,
you're either already dead, or you're not.

05:19.958 --> 05:23.083
So, what is the fucking name?

05:28.625 --> 05:32.208
Zuri Wench, Sun City Bank.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.541
And Eastern Europe?

05:35.458 --> 05:37.708
When Max is settled, she'll reach out.

05:38.291 --> 05:40.416
Deal. Go get your money.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.416
Hey, Mike! Thanks for the ride.
I'll watch that show.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.375
Wendy, tell her to put a ring on it, okay?

06:10.625 --> 06:13.208
-Ready?
-Do you have to be so friendly?

06:13.708 --> 06:15.500
What can I say? I'm a people person.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.666
What were you drawing on the plane?

06:18.500 --> 06:21.416
Just something I saw
while I was selling your business.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.500
Set off my espionage
Spidey-senses, actually. Here.

06:35.833 --> 06:39.083
Jesus.
I didn't think you'd be coming personally.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.833
My op, my asset.

06:40.916 --> 06:43.375
Yeah, Max Meladze, this is...

06:43.458 --> 06:44.958
Ellen Davis.

06:45.041 --> 06:45.875
Yeah.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.916
So you're my new case officer.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.708
I am.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.458
We'll get you cleaned you up,
take you to the safe house,

06:53.541 --> 06:55.625
then move you on to Langley
for your intake procedure.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.916
Where we pretend that Max is a new asset.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.458
-Got a problem with that?
-A little.

07:00.541 --> 07:03.166
You know, it's compounding duplicity.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.958
If the agency has a vested interest
in Max becoming an asset,

07:08.125 --> 07:09.791
why can't we just say that?

07:09.875 --> 07:15.250
Because the CIA is not one entity.
We don't all have the same agenda.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.833
Operations is in
the "get shit done" business.

07:17.916 --> 07:20.500
OGC is in the "do it legally" business.

07:20.583 --> 07:23.500
But the Office of Security,
they're in the "paranoia" business.

07:23.583 --> 07:24.791
They are true believers,

07:24.875 --> 07:27.833
who actively assume
we are all spies and traitors,

07:27.916 --> 07:30.125
and they are the ones
who are going to vet Max.

07:30.208 --> 07:34.125
They'll look for anything that could
compromise the integrity of the agency.

07:34.750 --> 07:38.208
-Integrity.
-I know, but it is a short-term problem.

07:38.291 --> 07:43.041
Once we get her back, vetted,
and in Belarus, they can't do a thing.

07:49.916 --> 07:50.750
It's locked.

07:51.666 --> 07:55.125
I need to debrief Ms. Meladze.
Meet us at Langley in two hours.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.041
Really?

08:33.833 --> 08:35.875
Graymailing the agency.

08:37.291 --> 08:39.625
Gotten reckless since you left Belarus.

08:39.708 --> 08:43.208
I had no choice.
You abandoned me in this shithole country.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.750
-It wasn't my call.
-But you went along with it.

08:45.833 --> 08:48.291
So, what now,
you want me to forgive and forget?

08:48.375 --> 08:51.541
Go back to Belarus,
risk my life again for the CIA?

08:52.083 --> 08:53.416
If that's even your real plan.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.041
Trust me, if I wanted you dead,
I wouldn't wait.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.916
Inserting you back in country?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Getting you close to Kuznetsov?
That's an intelligence coup for me,

09:03.083 --> 09:06.916
which makes keeping you alive
worth the risk.

09:07.625 --> 09:10.333
Unless you've already gone
and told the lawyer too much.

09:10.916 --> 09:11.750
No.

09:12.833 --> 09:15.625
Don't lie, Max.
I know you're sleeping with him.

09:15.708 --> 09:18.416
He's a useful tool, nothing more.

09:18.958 --> 09:22.500
I certainly wouldn't jeopardize my future
by giving him dirt on you.

09:24.166 --> 09:27.000
Then at the moment,
I need you and you need me.

09:27.083 --> 09:30.583
So we're in balance.
But let's be crystal clear...

09:31.583 --> 09:36.500
You don't pass your test today,
you become a liability, not an asset.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.708
There is no way
you get the fake Air Force One shot.

09:58.791 --> 10:01.500
I've tried six times.
Security's always on it.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.541
You're not in a book club
with the overnight guard.

10:04.625 --> 10:09.833
You have a book club?
You didn't invite me? I... I'm devastated.

10:09.916 --> 10:10.791
I still could.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.500
If you help me get a picture
in the cash room at the Main Treasury.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.583
-OFAC doesn't have access.
-We're on different teams.

10:17.666 --> 10:20.833
So what? Double agents are sexy.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.000
Hey, buddy.

10:23.708 --> 10:25.500
Hi. Owen. Prodigal roommate.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.541
Linus. I work with Terence at Treasury.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.625
He's being modest.
He's a big deal at OFAC.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.500
Good for you.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.541
Yeah.

10:37.958 --> 10:42.041
I'm gonna go see
if Laura got that NSA challenge coin.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.500
-He's cute.
-And you're a dead man walking.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.708
Clearly my pep talk didn't work.

10:49.791 --> 10:52.916
Using Hannah's credit card
for a hookup is cruel, even for you.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.875
-Come on. That's not what happened.
-Don't tell me, tell her.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.583
She does not wanna talk to you.

11:03.666 --> 11:05.916
Don't you have
some creepy senator to go worship?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.625
I heard your little one-act play
at the gala failed.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.750
Smoot confirmed you're still a nobody,

11:10.833 --> 11:13.916
so they're ready for a new hearing date
just as quickly as we schedule it.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.416
Don't you lose sleep
working for a psychopath?

11:16.500 --> 11:20.958
You think Nyland's any better?
Everyone in D.C. is out for themselves.

11:21.583 --> 11:23.875
-Including you.
-Thank you for your wise words.

11:23.958 --> 11:26.666
-Can we have a minute now?
-It's fine.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.875
-I'm sorry. I know you're pissed.
-What are you sorry about, Owen?

11:34.958 --> 11:36.833
Lying to me? The hotel bill?

11:36.916 --> 11:39.458
Or using my credit card
to sleep with some Russian woman?

11:39.541 --> 11:42.041
That did not happpen, it was for work.
I slept on the couch.

11:42.125 --> 11:44.583
You don't have to lie to me.
I am not your girlfriend anymore.

11:44.666 --> 11:46.375
Hannah, I'm not lying to you.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.583
She's a former asset
that I was forced to babysit.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.208
She's the bane of my existence.

11:55.291 --> 11:59.000
I thought I got rid of her,
and then I was dragged back to Phoenix.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.916
Well, she sounded sexy.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.583
-Is she sexy?
-No, she's crazy.

12:05.666 --> 12:07.916
-You have a thing for crazy.
-I do not.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.166
Don't make me go through the laundry list
of hot and crazy you mowed through.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.083
I... I was processing our breakup.

12:16.166 --> 12:20.125
You're the most serious relationship
I ever had. I was trying to get over you.

12:24.958 --> 12:26.708
I am really sorry.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.375
I never should've
asked for your credit card,

12:31.458 --> 12:33.875
never should've involved you in my work.

12:34.333 --> 12:37.333
I'm still figuring out this job,
figuring out my life,

12:37.958 --> 12:42.708
and I've made a lot of mistakes,
but, by far, the worst one is hurting you.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.166
What am I gonna do with you?

12:53.375 --> 12:56.250
I know better
than to keep trying to fix you.

12:57.166 --> 12:58.333
But here I am,

12:58.416 --> 13:04.041
invested in the guy that you could be,
if you just got your shit together.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.250
So get your shit together.

13:14.583 --> 13:17.750
No, I think... I think we're good.

13:17.833 --> 13:20.000
Okay. I'm gonna cut you off.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.708
Fine. But you have to help me
with the scavenger hunt.

13:23.791 --> 13:25.625
-Sure. Yeah. Please.

13:26.291 --> 13:30.083
Oh, there's, like, a CIA thingy here.
Donus Kronus? No...

13:30.708 --> 13:32.208
-Kryptos Donuts?
-Kryptos.

13:32.291 --> 13:33.625
What the fuck is that?

13:33.708 --> 13:37.291
It's a sculpture at Langley
of an unsolved encrypted message.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.208
The donut shop in the CIA lobby

13:39.291 --> 13:42.416
sells a donut that has the code
out of powdered sugar.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.625
You can only get it
if you work at the CIA.

13:45.250 --> 13:48.458
-I'll just grab a bag of them. You know?
-Mr. Hendricks.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.416
He just got here.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.500
Can you just give me a minute, please?

13:54.583 --> 13:56.875
-No can do.
-Yeah, can do.

13:56.958 --> 13:59.416
I'm talking to my friend.
I'll come when it's over.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.875
-The chief of staff can fucking wait.
-No, he can't.

14:01.958 --> 14:06.083
-Yeah, he can. What are you--? No.
-Owen. It's fine.

14:06.166 --> 14:09.541
It's not okay. I'm sorry, again.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.958
I'll bring you some donuts.

14:29.541 --> 14:32.291
I was very clear. If the president
needs to call you about this,

14:32.375 --> 14:34.291
you will find yourself primaried.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.166
Is that a piña colada?

14:39.250 --> 14:41.166
Yeah, you want some?

14:41.250 --> 14:43.375
No. What have you found?

14:43.458 --> 14:44.291
Yeah.

14:45.500 --> 14:50.833
Uh-- Actually, first...
How well do you know Senator Smoot?

14:51.750 --> 14:56.416
Well enough to know he is not the asshole
who gave your asset my CIA nickname.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.833
Okay. He sent me a subpoena,
mostly to get at my boss.

15:00.916 --> 15:03.083
But it's gonna jam me up,
so I'd like for it to go away.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.000
Permanently.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.958
And for him to leave the OGC alone
for a while.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.166
Leverage is nice, isn't it?

15:10.750 --> 15:11.708
Yeah.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.958
So can you make him stand down?

15:15.041 --> 15:17.166
Yeah. He'll squawk, but, yeah.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.208
Great.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.500
The case officer
that broke security protocol

15:21.583 --> 15:25.208
and told an asset your former nickname
is Xander Goi.

15:26.291 --> 15:29.625
Never heard of him. You trust the source?

15:30.125 --> 15:34.000
-The source is the former asset.
-Which means you don't trust her.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.916
Except this makes sense.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.333
I went to Vienna
to speak to Xander about the asset,

15:38.416 --> 15:39.625
and the next thing I know,

15:39.708 --> 15:42.125
someone tries to kill me
on the way to the airport.

15:43.166 --> 15:44.000
Interesting.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.791
Sounds like Goi has a lot more to hide
than my CIA nickname.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.083
Okay, I'll handle it.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.583
Sir, when you-- Forgive me.

15:56.666 --> 15:59.500
When you say "handle it,"
you mean you'll call and yell at him,

15:59.583 --> 16:02.458
or are you gonna poison needle
jam him on a pastry run?

16:05.708 --> 16:08.833
Things seem hectic over at the OGC lately.

16:09.791 --> 16:11.791
Could be good for me
to have a clear picture

16:11.875 --> 16:14.125
of potential problems
that might land on my desk.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.791
-Is that--? Are you asking me--?
-You've proven yourself useful.

16:19.875 --> 16:22.125
I'm asking if you'd like to continue.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.875
Well, I appreciate that, sir.

16:29.416 --> 16:34.208
But I have too much respect for Mr. Nyland
to do anything behind his back.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.708
Good. You passed.

16:42.791 --> 16:46.916
Nyland's a friend.
I'd never actually ask you to betray him.

16:47.666 --> 16:49.125
-We're done.

16:50.416 --> 16:52.291
You can drink your piña colada.

17:03.458 --> 17:06.375
The first step to becoming
an official asset is paperwork.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.041
Dozens of forms to fill out,
including a full history.

17:09.125 --> 17:12.291
Then you'll go through a psych eval,
and finally you'll get polygraphed.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.583
The riskiest part.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.500
Not for me. I lie for a living.

17:15.583 --> 17:19.625
There's literally a sensor on the chair
to measure your sphincter response.

17:19.708 --> 17:20.583
My what?

17:21.166 --> 17:23.000
Your butt pucker.

17:25.708 --> 17:28.416
If we're trying to slip Max in
as a brand new asset,

17:28.500 --> 17:32.041
don't we all have to be on the same page
about her recruitment backstory?

17:32.125 --> 17:35.625
Yes, we'll say her name came up
in intelligence gathering,

17:35.708 --> 17:38.500
we did a little digging
and discovered that she was in prison.

17:38.583 --> 17:41.791
-We got her out in exchange for--
-No, we didn't get her out.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.041
When her case was thrown out,

17:44.125 --> 17:47.541
it created an opportunity
for Operations to recruit her.

17:49.750 --> 17:54.000
What? Wha-- Who brings a kid to the CIA?

17:54.083 --> 17:57.625
Someone doesn't check his e-mails.
It's Family Day.

17:58.833 --> 18:03.166
The perfect day to vet Max because
they've scrubbed the office for civilians.

18:08.791 --> 18:11.583
-I thought it would be nicer.
-Ha. Yeah.

18:11.666 --> 18:15.000
When I showed up, I thought it'd be
<i>Mission: Impossible</i>, high-tech shit.

18:15.791 --> 18:19.500
All I got was a 20-year-old computer
and a shredder from the Cold War.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.375
-You got any friends up there?
-No.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.708
A lot's changed since you've been gone.

18:42.791 --> 18:45.916
Turns out being a Russian mobster
has a high degree of getting you killed.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.250
Top row is management, right?

18:48.333 --> 18:51.333
Council. Only a few remain from my time.

18:51.416 --> 18:55.166
There's Stas, Lev, Ivan.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.625
Stas was the one who approved
my execution.

18:57.708 --> 19:00.041
You'll have to kill him
along with a few lieutenants.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.041
Sorry, we're killing people now?

19:02.125 --> 19:05.958
She means neutralize,
and we've already started a list.

19:06.041 --> 19:09.208
Yuri. Oksana.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.708
Nichka.

19:12.208 --> 19:15.500
No, I think I can
win over Yuri and Nichka.

19:16.125 --> 19:19.666
Oksana definitely has to be killed,
or neutralized.

19:20.541 --> 19:22.666
-Do you know who the gatekeeper is yet?
-The who?

19:22.750 --> 19:26.250
It's the Council member who I need
to bribe to welcome me back on.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.041
We're working on it. Paperwork time.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.833
May I?

19:39.916 --> 19:41.458
Knock yourself out.

19:43.708 --> 19:44.791
Full name.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.541
Maxine Vasilyevna Meladze.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.500
Birthplace?

19:52.125 --> 19:53.875
Babruysk, Belarus.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.291
Parents?

19:56.875 --> 19:57.750
Deceased.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.541
-Siblings?
-Deceased.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.041
Marital status?

20:15.208 --> 20:16.375
Widowed.

20:18.833 --> 20:19.833
Children?

20:23.166 --> 20:24.166
None.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.458
All right. I'm gonna go talk to the shrink
and the polygrapher.

20:35.541 --> 20:39.166
Play up the fact I'm new and never
overseen an evaluation of an asset before.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.916
With luck, I'll be able to flag
any potential issues

20:42.000 --> 20:43.583
before Max even sits down.

20:44.291 --> 20:45.291
That's smart.

20:45.375 --> 20:46.958
Yeah, I know.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.291
God, I could be at a spa right now.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.875
I say we wait an hour, then we sneak out.

20:54.958 --> 20:55.958
Yeah.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.541
Are you guys hiding in here?

21:01.625 --> 21:02.750
A hundred percent.

21:04.375 --> 21:05.916
Can one of you two do me a huge favor?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
-What?
-No.

21:07.916 --> 21:09.458
Can I tag you in on my graymail case?

21:09.541 --> 21:12.083
She's being vetted and I feel
a more seasoned attorney is required.

21:12.166 --> 21:14.958
Forget it. The only reason
you'd try to pawn this off on us

21:15.041 --> 21:17.625
is if it was a shit show
you were trying to get away from.

21:17.708 --> 21:18.666
That's not true.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.208
Hard pass. Good luck.

21:21.291 --> 21:23.000
What if I ask Nyland?

21:24.750 --> 21:27.250
You're gonna tell the boss
you're incapable of doing your job?

21:27.333 --> 21:30.541
Confess all your fuck-ups and let him
use them against you? Go for it.

21:30.625 --> 21:32.333
You've been super helpful. Thank you.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.458
Hey, kids.
Lester's got candy in his office.

21:41.625 --> 21:42.458
Enjoy.

21:49.666 --> 21:52.041
Guys, who did this?

21:53.583 --> 21:54.416
What?

21:55.250 --> 21:57.000
Uh, should I come back, sir?

21:57.083 --> 22:01.083
No, no, no. Things will only
get worse once the sugar kicks in.

22:01.166 --> 22:02.416
Guys. Come on.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.208
Give Dad a minute, all right?

22:04.291 --> 22:06.000
Wanna go play in the waiting room?

22:07.416 --> 22:08.625
Yay.

22:12.083 --> 22:13.083
Get out of here.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.375
Thank you.

22:20.166 --> 22:23.958
The asset has been secured.
Gilbane is starting the vetting process.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.000
I assume you want me to provide oversight?

22:27.083 --> 22:30.416
Yes, the asset is still on our dance card
until she's fully vetted.

22:32.708 --> 22:35.916
You wouldn't happen to have any advice
for me to help me navigate the process?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.333
Well, unfortunately there's
not a lot you can do.

22:38.833 --> 22:41.583
We don't get any control
over the questions in the swirl.

22:41.666 --> 22:45.041
Clearly you have to hide her
agency history from the polygrapher.

22:45.125 --> 22:48.708
-What about her criminal history?
-No one cares.

22:48.791 --> 22:53.875
She was a spy, traitor to her country.
Agency expects her to be a scumbag.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.166
Anything else?

22:57.416 --> 22:59.291
No. Uh, yes.

22:59.375 --> 23:04.208
Actually, I had a meeting--
Two meetings with Kevin Mills, Not Bob.

23:04.875 --> 23:08.875
He wanted to discuss the asset situation
and why his nickname had come up.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.625
You didn't tell me that.

23:10.708 --> 23:13.708
I wanted you to have deniability
in case things went south.

23:14.541 --> 23:18.041
I assured him that
it was an isolated incident and then...

23:19.250 --> 23:23.416
he asked me if I wanted to spy for him
at the OGC, and I said no.

23:30.458 --> 23:31.291
I know.

23:33.708 --> 23:37.083
Kevin called me, said it was a test,

23:37.166 --> 23:38.625
and you passed.

23:41.916 --> 23:45.125
Did he say that to you because
he thought I wouldn't say anything,

23:45.208 --> 23:46.708
or because I would?

23:47.416 --> 23:50.583
Good question. Always assume the worst.

23:50.666 --> 23:53.708
Fewer surprises. Now, get back to work.

23:54.541 --> 23:57.791
Hey, guys. Who wants a donut?

24:05.041 --> 24:08.250
-Hey, I've been looking for you.
-Sorry, can't really talk now--

24:08.333 --> 24:11.791
-Good. I just need your pretty face.
-What is happening?

24:11.875 --> 24:13.791
Selfies for my mom. Look cute.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.583
-Jesus.
-She found out it's Family Day.

24:16.666 --> 24:20.083
I've gotten three messages about the fact
I haven't given her grandkids.

24:20.166 --> 24:21.250
Right.

24:21.833 --> 24:25.250
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing. I'm just a little overwhelmed.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.166
You don't wanna help me
get my graymailer vetted, do you?

24:28.250 --> 24:29.833
-Fuck no.
-I didn't think so.

24:29.916 --> 24:32.750
Can you point me in the right direction
for Dr. Hirsch, the psychologist?

24:33.375 --> 24:35.458
Not for me. He's vetting the asset.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.625
Fourth floor. But stay out of his office,
or everyone'll think you're nuts.

24:39.708 --> 24:40.916
Sure. Thank you.

24:45.708 --> 24:48.791
Hey, Dr. Hirsch? Hi, I'm Owen Hendricks.

24:48.875 --> 24:52.666
Oh, yes, and I owe you a psych eval
for a new asset.

24:52.750 --> 24:56.833
-I thought we weren't starting till 12:30.
-No, we're not. I just, um...

24:56.916 --> 25:00.041
I'm new, and I guess I'm a little nervous.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.416
Well, say no more.
Have a seat. Let's talk about it.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.541
Uh, I'm not here for me.

25:06.125 --> 25:10.333
I figured I'd introduce myself
before you sat down with the asset.

25:10.916 --> 25:15.375
-You know, see if I could help at all.
-Look, since you're new, I'll be honest,

25:15.458 --> 25:17.208
I always check yes, okay?

25:17.708 --> 25:20.625
Unless they pull down their pants
and take a dump on the floor, I pass them.

25:20.708 --> 25:23.250
Actually, there was a guy I passed
who pissed himself,

25:23.333 --> 25:26.416
but he was charming in all other respects.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.791
Oh, okay, great. That's...

25:31.458 --> 25:36.333
Um, hey, you don't happen to know
the polygrapher, Dustin something?

25:36.416 --> 25:39.166
Dustin Hatch. That kid's wound tight.

25:41.041 --> 25:45.416
-Um, meaning?
-Let's say, he's as tough as I am easy.

25:45.916 --> 25:49.541
If your asset makes a single screw up,
he'll bounce them.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.375
Right. You don't happen to see
a lot of employees suffering from anxiety?

26:00.458 --> 26:01.833
No, most of them enjoy it.

26:02.833 --> 26:04.416
-That's a joke.
-Right.

26:04.500 --> 26:08.125
Actually, it's not.
You kind of have to be crazy to work here.

26:08.625 --> 26:10.500
Are you having anxiety?

26:10.583 --> 26:12.666
No. No, no. I was just asking.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.000
I will see you out there.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.125
Hi.

26:31.458 --> 26:34.916
-You okay in there?
-Yeah. Yeah.

26:47.458 --> 26:49.000
Hey.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.666
Are you the polygrapher?

26:50.750 --> 26:52.250
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah?

26:52.333 --> 26:54.041
Dustin Hatch.

26:54.125 --> 26:56.875
Owen Hendricks, OGC.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.458
I just started a couple of weeks ago.

26:58.541 --> 27:00.791
This is the first asset I've vetted.

27:00.875 --> 27:04.375
Pretty standard stuff.
You've been swirled before, obviously.

27:04.458 --> 27:08.333
Same protocol, control questions,
and then the heavy stuff.

27:08.416 --> 27:10.416
As long as she tells the truth,
we'll be done in 30.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.583
Good to know.

27:25.833 --> 27:29.416
People are fascinated with the whole
lie detector thing, aren't they?

27:29.500 --> 27:30.583
I guess.

27:30.666 --> 27:32.583
You ever taken it over
to a friend's place,

27:32.666 --> 27:35.333
wait for your buddy to get loaded
and then strap him in?

27:37.250 --> 27:38.916
No. I haven't.

27:39.833 --> 27:42.791
You know, agency equipment
is carefully calibrated.

27:42.875 --> 27:46.666
So any deviance
would impugn the validity of the test.

27:46.750 --> 27:47.958
Right. No, of course.

27:48.041 --> 27:51.416
I just meant I wonder what would
happen to the results if you were drunk.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.250
I don't drink.

27:55.541 --> 27:58.208
Right on, right on.
Yeah. No, neither do I.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.208
-Hey, you got a sec?
-No.

28:09.291 --> 28:10.958
Great, I saw this yesterday.

28:11.041 --> 28:14.583
I thought that it looked important.
Was wondering if it means anything to you.

28:16.125 --> 28:18.875
Hey, buddy. Have you seen this?

28:20.583 --> 28:22.375
Jesus. Motherfucker.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.708
-I'll take that as a yes.
-Where did you see that?

28:24.791 --> 28:28.333
-You don't want to know.
-Where did you fucking see that?

28:28.416 --> 28:32.125
It was in a train car in Arizona
owned by the Aquino Cartel.

28:32.208 --> 28:35.916
There were a dozen crates
with this symbol. What are they?

28:36.000 --> 28:39.500
Uh, they are why I was Ambien sandwiched.

28:39.583 --> 28:42.166
That doesn't sound good,
but what are they?

28:43.083 --> 28:44.041
What are they?

28:46.166 --> 28:48.125
American anti-tank missiles.

28:48.208 --> 28:51.500
Basically, a terrorist's wet dream.

28:51.583 --> 28:56.083
My nightmare spec ops team
is smuggling them out of the country,

28:56.166 --> 28:58.875
so they can covertly track who buys them.

28:59.500 --> 29:03.833
They're dumb enough to think this
will turn into a terrorist turkey shoot,

29:03.916 --> 29:05.750
instead of a career-ending clusterfuck

29:05.833 --> 29:08.916
that will headline the <i>New York Times</i>
for a month.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.583
-I'll just leave you to it.
-Don't fucking move.

29:13.666 --> 29:14.583
Fuck.

29:15.541 --> 29:17.375
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Oh, hi, it's me.

29:17.458 --> 29:20.000
You made a deal
with a fucking drug cartel?

29:20.791 --> 29:23.458
<i>-I don't know what you're talking about.</i>
-Bullshit.

29:23.541 --> 29:25.416
I have an eyewitness.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.458
Hey. Hi, I work with Janus.

29:31.541 --> 29:34.416
I saw the rockets
on the cartel freight train.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.958
<i>What were you doing on a cartel train?</i>

29:37.041 --> 29:39.166
Not the point.

29:39.958 --> 29:42.166
Get the rockets back now.

29:42.250 --> 29:46.750
<i>Look, say we did make a deal</i>
<i>with a third party for distribution.</i>

29:46.833 --> 29:50.333
<i>We definitely would've disabled</i>
<i>the rockets before we handed them over.</i>

29:50.416 --> 29:53.833
Uh, yeah, if you're talking about
clipping the guidance wires,

29:53.916 --> 29:56.958
there is a YouTube video
on how to fix that.

30:01.375 --> 30:04.041
<i>-Let me get back to you.</i>
-Yeah, you do that.

30:04.916 --> 30:06.291
We are so fucked.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.875
We?

30:10.041 --> 30:13.125
Uh, if I have to testify

30:13.208 --> 30:15.833
about how I allowed
an unsanctioned covert op

30:15.916 --> 30:18.041
to put rockets in the hands of terrorists,

30:18.125 --> 30:22.125
you'll have to testify about
how you ended up on a cartel drug train.

30:22.208 --> 30:23.541
That would be bad.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.625
Yeah, asshole.

30:25.708 --> 30:27.375
If Congress finds out about this,

30:27.458 --> 30:30.000
it will be the biggest scandal
in a generation.

30:56.041 --> 30:57.583
Oh. Dustin.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.708
Hey. I wanna clear the air from earlier.

31:00.791 --> 31:02.333
I was just being friendly,

31:02.416 --> 31:04.583
trying to get a sense
of what the deal was.

31:04.666 --> 31:08.041
I wasn't trying to suck up or sway
the outcome of this thing in any way.

31:09.750 --> 31:13.041
You're saying you were trying to influence
the impartiality of the swirl?

31:13.125 --> 31:16.916
What? No. That's the exact opposite
of what I was trying to say.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.375
Okay, Amish, she's all yours.

31:25.583 --> 31:26.750
So?

31:26.833 --> 31:31.250
So she's incredibly intelligent
and profoundly ruthless.

31:31.333 --> 31:34.750
She'll make a phenomenal asset,
but you can't trust her,

31:34.833 --> 31:36.250
like, at all.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.458
I need to pee.

31:46.458 --> 31:49.500
Whoa, hey.
I thought you said you had to pee?

31:49.583 --> 31:52.916
I do but if holding it will help
with the polygraph, so will these.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.875
If he finds out you messed with
your heart rate, he'll fail you.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.333
If I don't pass the polygraph, I'm dead.

32:00.416 --> 32:02.458
Is that what Ellen told you
in your pre-brief?

32:02.541 --> 32:06.958
-Yes. So you need to make sure I pass.
-I don't have that kind of power.

32:07.041 --> 32:09.791
-I thought you wanted to help me.
-I do. I can't help with this.

32:09.875 --> 32:12.958
Do you still not understand me
after all we've been through?

32:13.041 --> 32:15.000
I will do what I must to survive,

32:15.083 --> 32:19.458
and that means exposing your duplicity
and criminality if I think it will help.

32:51.250 --> 32:55.208
Jeez, your baseline is super twitchy.

32:57.291 --> 32:58.250
Are you nervous?

32:59.625 --> 33:00.500
A little.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.333
Well, don't be.

33:03.875 --> 33:06.500
As long as you tell the truth,
this will be easy.

33:15.666 --> 33:17.625
Do you think she's gonna pass?

33:19.541 --> 33:21.208
What happens if she doesn't?

33:26.708 --> 33:32.416
Remind me, back in Yemen you said
you hadn't met Max before, right?

33:32.500 --> 33:33.458
Right.

33:36.958 --> 33:37.833
Why?

33:38.666 --> 33:41.750
It's just, ever since she's gotten here,

33:41.833 --> 33:44.416
you haven't asked me
one question about her.

33:45.250 --> 33:47.583
And yet, it feels like you know
exactly who she is.

33:47.666 --> 33:49.875
All right, Miss Meladze,

33:50.750 --> 33:52.875
First, I'll ask you a couple of questions.

33:52.958 --> 33:54.708
Please answer yes or no.

33:55.958 --> 33:58.166
Is your name Maxine Meladze?

33:58.250 --> 33:59.250
Yes.

33:59.833 --> 34:01.458
Were you born in the United States?

34:02.958 --> 34:03.833
No.

34:06.916 --> 34:10.625
Relax, Miss Meladze,
so we can get an accurate reading.

34:14.916 --> 34:16.875
Were you born in Belarus?

34:17.750 --> 34:18.625
Yes.

34:21.416 --> 34:24.875
Please lie to the next question
to establish your baseline.

34:26.166 --> 34:28.375
Is it the year 2015?

34:28.458 --> 34:29.666
Yes.

34:29.750 --> 34:31.541
Okay.

34:34.375 --> 34:35.291
Good.

34:37.750 --> 34:40.583
Now, how were you recruited?

35:07.541 --> 35:09.041
I work for the CIA.

35:10.541 --> 35:13.708
I know you killed your husband
and blamed his murder on a rival.

35:14.250 --> 35:16.375
Then used the tragedy to drop some bodies

35:16.458 --> 35:19.583
and take your late husband's place
in the Russian mafia.

35:20.333 --> 35:23.500
And I know if the Council
were to find out what you did...

35:23.583 --> 35:26.000
they'd cut you apart with a blowtorch.

35:30.666 --> 35:31.750
What do you want?

35:33.083 --> 35:35.000
For you to start working for me.

35:36.166 --> 35:37.833
Nothing dangerous. Just...

35:38.916 --> 35:41.291
tell me everything everybody tells you,

35:41.750 --> 35:45.083
especially your friends
in Russian military intelligence.

35:45.666 --> 35:47.000
And if I say no?

35:47.875 --> 35:48.750
You won't.

35:49.791 --> 35:50.875
You can't.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.041
I'll be in touch.

35:55.958 --> 36:00.166
A case officer approached me,
when I came out of prison.

36:01.791 --> 36:04.750
She made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.000
<i>That's a strong accusation.</i>

36:18.083 --> 36:20.458
Yes, sir.
But this operation is priority one,

36:20.541 --> 36:22.541
and I don't feel comfortable
taking Hendricks

36:22.625 --> 36:24.583
if there's even a hint
he's been compromised.

36:29.333 --> 36:30.500
What's going on?

36:30.583 --> 36:32.500
Gilbane wants to swirl Hendricks.

36:32.583 --> 36:35.708
She's worried he's been compromised
by our squeaky wheel.

36:36.708 --> 36:38.791
Since when do we trust Operations?

36:38.875 --> 36:42.833
You're just trying to torpedo Owen
because you don't a lawyer on your op.

36:42.916 --> 36:45.541
They shared a hotel room
together in Phoenix.

36:57.375 --> 36:58.958
You sent someone to spy on him?

36:59.041 --> 37:02.625
Given Meladze's value,
I felt I had no other choice.

37:07.208 --> 37:08.208
Go get Hendricks.

37:09.333 --> 37:13.875
You shouldn't be here when I tell him.
Go make sure the asset is squared away.

37:14.583 --> 37:18.916
Fine, but I am observing the swirl.
It's my operation.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.041
Understood.

37:20.125 --> 37:24.500
But Salazar will be observing with you.
He's my guy.

37:33.208 --> 37:34.750
Owen's not gonna be happy.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.083
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

37:37.166 --> 37:39.250
It's a single-issue polygraph.

37:40.125 --> 37:43.583
There's a concern the squeaky wheel
may have compromised your objectivity.

37:43.666 --> 37:45.666
A concern. Of whose?

37:45.750 --> 37:47.833
Gilbane's?
She's just trying to get rid of me.

37:47.916 --> 37:49.875
She's not even being subtle about it.

37:49.958 --> 37:52.791
You shared a hotel room with Meladze
in Phoenix.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.000
Yes, of course, I did.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.666
She ditched her first babysitters.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.583
So they asked me
to go down there and get her.

37:58.666 --> 38:01.666
How stupid would I have been
if I let her have her own room?

38:01.750 --> 38:04.041
Listen to me. Listen to me.

38:04.125 --> 38:07.041
Gilbane is the one who has been
compromised by the asset.

38:07.125 --> 38:08.583
You have proof of that?

38:10.166 --> 38:11.000
No.

38:12.625 --> 38:14.333
But there's clearly
a history between them,

38:14.416 --> 38:16.333
even if she insists that there isn't.

38:16.416 --> 38:17.541
Look, my hands are tied.

38:18.916 --> 38:21.541
She made a formal request.
I can't legally ignore it.

38:21.625 --> 38:24.125
But Salazar will oversee the swirl.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.958
She'll make sure
everything stays on track.

38:49.583 --> 38:51.291
Is your name Owen Hendricks?

38:53.583 --> 38:54.416
Yes.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.416
-Are you 24 years old?
-Yes.

38:57.333 --> 39:00.916
Please lie to the next question
to establish your baseline.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.208
Are you a citizen of the United States?

39:03.291 --> 39:04.333
No.

39:05.875 --> 39:09.541
Did you lie earlier
when you told me that you didn't drink?

39:11.083 --> 39:12.375
Yeah.

39:16.083 --> 39:18.500
You know these tests are dog shit, right?

39:19.625 --> 39:21.083
The National Academy of Sciences

39:21.166 --> 39:23.458
says they're no more accurate
than flipping a coin.

39:23.541 --> 39:25.000
That study was incredibly flawed.

39:25.083 --> 39:27.750
You're saying that 'cause
you'd be out of a job if people bought it.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.833
-No, that's not true--
-Come on.

39:29.916 --> 39:34.916
Any test that I can fool by clenching my
sphincter is flawed. I'll prove it to you.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.333
-I'm clenching, I'm not clenching...
-Mr. Hendricks.

39:37.416 --> 39:41.041
Mr. Hendricks could you stop that.
Would you stop doing that?

39:42.458 --> 39:44.708
Tampering with the test
is an automatic failure.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.708
Fine. I've ceased clenching.

39:47.791 --> 39:49.791
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

39:54.125 --> 39:58.250
Have you ever had contact with Maxine
Meladze prior to joining the OGC?

39:58.333 --> 39:59.166
No.

40:01.958 --> 40:04.583
Have you ever done
or said anything to Miss Meladze

40:04.666 --> 40:07.375
that would constitute a breach
of professional conduct?

40:07.458 --> 40:08.333
No.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.583
Have you ever seen Miss Meladze naked?

40:15.791 --> 40:16.875
Go fuck yourself.

40:16.958 --> 40:20.958
You are an employee of the CIA,
and that is an unacceptable response.

40:21.041 --> 40:24.291
Now, have you seen the asset naked?

40:27.416 --> 40:28.291
Yes.

40:32.166 --> 40:34.333
Have you ever had sexual contact
with the asset?

40:35.791 --> 40:38.083
-No.
-Have you ever wanted to have sexual--?

40:38.166 --> 40:40.875
-What kind of fucking question is that?
-You could just answer.

40:40.958 --> 40:44.458
Move on. The question was sexual contact,
asked and answered.

40:48.791 --> 40:52.416
Have you witnessed every step
of the asset's vetting process personally?

40:53.916 --> 40:55.166
Yes.

40:55.875 --> 41:00.041
And has Miss Meladze
lied in any of her responses?

41:01.291 --> 41:03.291
It's too broad of a question.
I can't answer that.

41:03.375 --> 41:07.958
Okay. To the best of your knowledge,
has she lied about anything?

41:13.625 --> 41:14.833
No.

41:21.458 --> 41:22.750
Are you compromised?

41:25.583 --> 41:27.416
Fuck yourself.

41:28.250 --> 41:31.500
Okay, you got what you needed.
This session is finished.

41:40.291 --> 41:41.875
Ah!

41:52.000 --> 41:53.833
-You okay?
-No. That was humiliating.

41:53.916 --> 41:57.791
I know, but you passed
and so did your asset.

41:57.875 --> 41:58.750
Wait.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.250
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.708
Oh, good. Fuck.

42:03.791 --> 42:05.833
-Listen, about Max--
-Stop.

42:05.916 --> 42:08.416
I truly do not care
that you saw her naked.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.791
I'd be shocked
if she didn't try and seduce you.

42:10.875 --> 42:13.083
-That's Asset 101.
-Yeah.

42:14.875 --> 42:17.125
And it's not why I'm breaking up with you.

42:18.208 --> 42:21.250
What? Wait, you're breaking up with me?

42:22.708 --> 42:26.166
You're a fun guy, Owen.
And the sex is top notch.

42:27.708 --> 42:31.666
But this thing that you do
where you stumble through serious stuff

42:31.750 --> 42:34.083
and hope that it works out well...

42:36.125 --> 42:37.833
it's too 20-something for me.

42:39.833 --> 42:41.583
I have my whole career mapped out.

42:41.666 --> 42:44.958
The last thing that I need
is to be dating some wildcard

42:45.041 --> 42:47.291
who doesn't even know what tomorrow holds.

42:53.750 --> 42:57.958
Be very careful with those two women.
You can't trust either of them.

43:01.666 --> 43:02.625
Yeah.

43:05.666 --> 43:08.083
Congratulations,
not only did you pass your polygraph,

43:08.166 --> 43:09.750
but you got your boss to call mine

43:09.833 --> 43:12.625
to insist that you stay
on my operation through reinsertion?

43:12.708 --> 43:14.500
No, I didn't.

43:15.125 --> 43:18.708
But if you ever try to sabotage me again,
it'll end badly for you.

43:18.791 --> 43:20.333
Consider me unafraid.

43:20.416 --> 43:21.541
Enough posturing.

43:21.625 --> 43:24.583
Let's focus on what's next:
buying my way back in.

43:25.458 --> 43:27.583
Do you know yet who I need to bribe?

43:27.666 --> 43:28.791
Lev Orlova.

43:28.875 --> 43:32.333
Oh, shit.
We definitely don't have enough money.

43:32.416 --> 43:34.333
He used to work with my husband.

43:34.416 --> 43:37.083
He thought he should be made
a lieutenant instead of me.

43:37.166 --> 43:39.250
He's gonna want at least 10 million
to make it hurt.

43:39.333 --> 43:42.541
That's three million more.
We really can't get it from the agency?

43:42.625 --> 43:45.125
Not without explaining
what we need it for.

43:45.208 --> 43:48.208
Which will level the Potemkin Village
we just built.

43:49.583 --> 43:51.958
Can you unsanction a Swiss bank account?

43:52.458 --> 43:56.583
I'm guessing you used to launder money
into Swiss banks under an assumed name?

43:56.666 --> 44:00.666
Five of them. But all the accounts
were locked six years ago

44:00.750 --> 44:03.083
when the U.S. hit Belarus and Russia
with sanctions.

44:03.166 --> 44:05.375
So we have to
get your accounts unsanctioned.

44:05.458 --> 44:07.666
Yes. You do.

44:08.625 --> 44:11.041
-Me?
-You insisted on staying involved.

44:11.125 --> 44:12.666
No, I didn't. I--

44:14.916 --> 44:17.291
Fine. How do I get the sanctions lifted?

44:18.208 --> 44:20.625
You're the lawyer, figure it out.

44:36.375 --> 44:39.458
Kryptos Donuts, as promised.

44:39.541 --> 44:41.250
-Score.
-Thank you.

44:41.333 --> 44:44.500
Late night cereal sesh? Right on.

44:50.375 --> 44:51.208
So?

44:52.041 --> 44:53.583
How's the hangover going?

44:53.666 --> 44:54.875
Tolerable.

44:55.708 --> 44:56.833
How was your day?

44:56.916 --> 45:00.750
It was so good.
Solved some problems, made a new one.

45:00.833 --> 45:04.541
Oh, Amelia dumped me,
said I was too 20-something for her.

45:05.208 --> 45:06.625
She meant 14.

45:06.708 --> 45:08.250
I was gonna say 12.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.166
Well, it's nice to know
I can count on your compassion.

45:18.833 --> 45:22.500
-Can I ask a Treasury Department question?
-Okay.

45:22.583 --> 45:25.375
One of my new problems
has to do with international sanctions.

45:25.458 --> 45:26.916
But I can't give you the specifics.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.833
-It'll make it hard for me to help you.
-Okay, um...

45:30.833 --> 45:33.875
Let's say Tony the Tiger works
for a foreign criminal organization

45:33.958 --> 45:37.458
which the U.S. has sanctioned.

45:37.541 --> 45:40.500
Are we talking tariffs, embargoes, NTBs,

45:40.583 --> 45:44.250
or has Snap, Crackle, and Pop
frozen Tony's individual assets?

45:44.333 --> 45:45.458
The last one.

45:45.541 --> 45:49.375
Okay, it's probably a unilateral sanction
on an SDN.

45:49.458 --> 45:51.333
Specially Designated National.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.291
Okay. Is there any way to get that lifted?

45:53.375 --> 45:55.208
You'd need an act of God, basically.

45:55.291 --> 45:58.250
My parents have repped several oligarchs
over the years.

45:58.333 --> 46:02.250
It's so gross, and they have never gotten
the U.S. government to budge on sanctions.

46:02.333 --> 46:04.125
Is there any way at all Tony the Tiger

46:04.208 --> 46:06.000
could get into one of those
sanctioned accounts

46:06.083 --> 46:08.291
without Snap, Crackle and Pop knowing?

46:08.375 --> 46:12.083
No. There's a giant list of sanctioned
accounts that goes to all the banks.

46:12.166 --> 46:13.541
It's updated daily and each account

46:13.625 --> 46:15.791
is literally locked
into the bank's computers.

46:15.875 --> 46:18.500
A red flag goes up
if anyone tries to access them.

46:18.583 --> 46:21.625
The only way to unlock an account
is to get it excluded by the bank.

46:21.708 --> 46:24.000
Okay, so who do I have
to talk to about that?

46:30.125 --> 46:31.125
Yo!

46:39.291 --> 46:41.875
As requested. Thanks for meeting me.

46:41.958 --> 46:43.208
No problem.

46:43.291 --> 46:46.375
You made it sound so clandestine,
how could I refuse?

46:46.458 --> 46:50.791
You know, in giving me these,
I win the scavenger hunt. I beat Terence.

46:51.750 --> 46:52.708
Yeah.

46:52.791 --> 46:56.625
Unfortunately, national security
trumps friendship at this moment.

46:57.208 --> 46:58.416
What's going on?

46:58.500 --> 47:01.625
I can't give you details
because this is so sensitive,

47:01.708 --> 47:04.250
but I need sanctions lifted
on a few Swiss bank accounts.

47:04.333 --> 47:07.458
They were swept up
in Russian sanctions six years ago.

47:07.541 --> 47:09.208
Yeah, no.

47:10.041 --> 47:11.875
Russia is way too radioactive.

47:11.958 --> 47:13.958
I know, but these are tangential.

47:14.041 --> 47:16.208
They're tied to
a mid-level criminal in Belarus.

47:16.291 --> 47:17.583
No one's gonna give a shit.

47:17.666 --> 47:22.000
The money in the accounts is crucial
to the success of a covert operation.

47:22.083 --> 47:25.458
One with profound
national security benefits.

47:26.666 --> 47:28.666
You'd be making a huge difference.

47:30.791 --> 47:33.666
-Why can't you go through proper channels?
-You know why.

47:33.750 --> 47:36.500
Nobody wants to put their name
on something that could fail.

47:36.583 --> 47:38.041
But it's not going to.

47:38.125 --> 47:39.375
That's what they all say.

47:39.458 --> 47:40.458
Yeah.

47:40.541 --> 47:42.666
Why should I stick my neck out for you?

47:44.458 --> 47:46.416
You mean
how can I make it worth your while?

47:47.583 --> 47:48.583
You tell me.

47:51.375 --> 47:52.333
I want a date.

47:53.750 --> 47:54.916
With your roommate.

47:58.208 --> 48:01.833
I mean, I can ask.
Pretty sure he'll say yes.

48:03.791 --> 48:08.416
Well, if he does, I will release
the sanctions on one account for one hour.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.791
That's the only way they go unnoticed.
Deal?

48:14.916 --> 48:16.208
Deal.

48:23.041 --> 48:26.166
I need to clarify something
before you're wheels up.

48:29.208 --> 48:32.208
The results of your swirl? You aced it.

48:32.916 --> 48:34.291
Except for here,

48:34.958 --> 48:38.375
when the polygrapher asked if the
squeaky wheel had lied about anything.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.708
Yes, sir, it was nothing relevant.

48:42.875 --> 48:45.833
The asset had a child that died,
a long time ago.

48:45.916 --> 48:48.375
She answered "none"
when asked if she had any children.

48:48.458 --> 48:51.833
Technically, it wasn't a lie. And I didn't
wanna give Dawn emotional leverage--

48:51.916 --> 48:53.375
Why the fuck not?

48:54.458 --> 48:57.166
This asset has a proverbial gun
to our heads.

48:57.250 --> 49:00.250
Threatening to expose secrets.
We need all the leverage we can get.

49:00.333 --> 49:02.291
Yes, sir. With respect, I wasn't finished.

49:02.375 --> 49:05.708
I will use every ounce of leverage
that we have to protect the agency.

49:05.791 --> 49:09.125
I just don't trust Dawn Gilbane
to do the same.

49:10.958 --> 49:11.916
I agree.

49:13.125 --> 49:14.666
Which is why I'm sending you.

49:15.958 --> 49:19.625
If Gilbane has been compromised,
you need to get me the proof.

49:44.291 --> 49:47.833
The next 48 hours are mission critical.

49:47.916 --> 49:52.208
We'll drop you in Italy, where you'll
continue on to Geneva by car.

49:52.291 --> 49:55.041
While you secure fresh money
from Meladze's accounts,

49:55.125 --> 49:57.541
my team and I will take your bag of cash,

49:57.625 --> 49:58.875
and we will head to Germany

49:58.958 --> 50:03.125
where we will begin mission planning
your reinsertion into Belarus.

50:06.125 --> 50:08.083
-What?
-There's no way that you allow us

50:08.166 --> 50:10.500
to run around Geneva
without operational oversight.

50:10.583 --> 50:13.500
Xander Goi landed in Geneva an hour ago.

50:13.583 --> 50:16.458
He is setting up shop at the consulate.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.541
<i>I'm sending you to Geneva</i>
<i>to backstop Hendricks.</i>

50:22.333 --> 50:24.666
Does he know this?

50:24.750 --> 50:28.333
No, and if things go smoothly,
he never will.

50:29.041 --> 50:32.875
And if things go sideways,
do we protect him or the asset?

50:32.958 --> 50:34.583
You protect the agency.

50:34.666 --> 50:35.916
If you can do that...

50:37.250 --> 50:39.625
and support Hendricks, fine,

50:39.708 --> 50:45.000
if not, can't swing a dead cat
in this town without hitting a new lawyer.

50:51.166 --> 50:53.916
You excited? You're going home.

50:56.083 --> 50:58.333
First, we need to survive the journey.
