01:18.200 --> 01:19.800
- Who shall I announce, Messer?
- Move!

01:19.880 --> 01:22.720
- Messer!
- Messer!

01:27.320 --> 01:28.480
Where is he?

01:32.200 --> 01:33.160
Don't get up.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.760
I couldn't stop them, I'm sorry.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.160
This is for you.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.520
A letter from the Pope. Read it.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.920
His Holiness' business
must account for what?

02:11.160 --> 02:14.520
Sixty... 80 percent of all your profits?

02:14.600 --> 02:18.480
Tithes and taxes
from every parish in Europe.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.320
How much income must that be a month?

02:23.680 --> 02:25.920
But he won't be banking
with you any longer.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.160
And I wouldn't be surprised
if others follow the Pope's lead.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.000
You'll find that most merchants,
don't like to do business with murderers.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.640
You think I don't know
who had Bredani killed?

02:38.840 --> 02:43.120
I employ men for their ability
with numbers. Not knives.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.040
And you'll find every one of them
has an alibi for that night.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.240
Now...

02:48.840 --> 02:51.200
shall we discuss the details
of the transfer?

02:53.560 --> 02:56.600
My accountant will need access
to all your records, of course.

02:56.680 --> 03:00.920
-Your accountant?
-Yes. My accountant.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.360
You see, Florence is going to change.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.520
No more fake republic,
manipulated by the Medici.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.640
No more hard-earned money wasted
on depraved artists and the common rabble.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.480
Not when I run this city.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.880
I need three days.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.680
To draw up the necessary documents.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.440
I suppose we are talking about moving

03:35.520 --> 03:37.360
the vast amount of money
from your bank to mine.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.920
I'll give you three days.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.160
Madonna Contessina.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.480
Please forgive the intrusion.
I'm sure your husband will explain.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.520
So this is art, is it?

04:00.600 --> 04:02.680
-And you paid good money for this?
-Yes.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.960
I was discussing it
with the Pope last night.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.120
See, I'm just a banker.

04:08.200 --> 04:12.280
Unlike, Messer Medici,
I don't claim to understand art,

04:12.360 --> 04:15.440
or know the mind
of a sodomite sculptor, like, um...

04:15.520 --> 04:19.280
-Donatello.
-Donatello. Yes.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.280
Is it true he intended this
to represent Florence?

04:23.360 --> 04:26.320
The boy David's victory over Goliath.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.000
It could symbolize the triumph
of our republic.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.960
I asked the Holy Father...

04:34.040 --> 04:37.680
where in the Bible it says
that Goliath was slain by a naked boy,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.560
who looks like a girl.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.960
The Pope was as nonplussed as I was.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.760
This is your Florence. Not mine.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.160
What's happened?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.840
Florence is being taken over
by Philistines.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.360
I must see the Pope at once.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.000
Forgive me, Your Holiness.
I needed to see you in person.

05:24.080 --> 05:28.480
-For confession, perhaps?
-Business.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.560
Ever since I gave you sanctuary in my home
you began to doubt me.

05:32.640 --> 05:36.240
Seen up close I am, small and weak,

05:36.320 --> 05:40.080
and my... wealth seems repellent.

05:42.080 --> 05:47.760
But my architect and engineer,
Filippo Brunelleschi, he...

05:47.840 --> 05:50.840
he is a giant of a man, a true genius,

05:50.920 --> 05:55.480
and he has this theory
he calls perspective.

05:55.560 --> 06:00.600
Something small may seem enormous,
depending from where you view it.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.200
And vice versa.

06:04.440 --> 06:08.680
I may not be a man you wish to view
across your dining table.

06:08.760 --> 06:13.320
But in the wider world,
you need my wealth and power.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.960
Your position is under threat.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.080
Duke Visconti and his allies in Rome
are plotting to install a new Pope.

06:24.160 --> 06:28.000
I know all about the Duke
and his plots and I have every faith...

06:29.400 --> 06:33.960
-That the Lord will provide a solution.
-And he has.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.480
He's provided me.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.000
I know Visconti.
I loaned him money in the past.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.720
He has to be defeated
and you returned to Rome.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.080
And how?

06:48.160 --> 06:52.320
-How do you propose to do that?
-Bishop Vitelleschi.

06:52.400 --> 06:56.960
Valiant Vitelleschi, the soldier-bishop,
he is brave and loyal

06:57.040 --> 07:01.440
and he is ready to fight for you,
his army is camped outside of Rome,

07:01.520 --> 07:05.240
but they need more men and weapons.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.240
I can fund that. Tomorrow.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.840
Pazzi would take weeks, by which time...

07:16.840 --> 07:17.960
it would be too late.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.200
You want me to retain you as my banker
so you can equip an army?

07:22.280 --> 07:27.480
-To keep the Church united behind you.
-The Papal banker must be devoted to God

07:27.560 --> 07:30.760
and the teachings of Christ!

07:30.840 --> 07:32.680
I may be an insignificant sinner,

07:32.760 --> 07:36.240
but my wealth can help
bigger and better men,

07:36.320 --> 07:39.640
men like Brunelleschi, men like... you.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.240
You're no smaller than your fellow men.

07:44.320 --> 07:50.240
But to God's all-seeing eye,
your sins may be monstrous.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.600
Are you sure there isn't anything
you wish to confess?

08:07.440 --> 08:11.480
Pazzi convinced you that I was behind
the murders of Albizzi and his son?

08:15.200 --> 08:18.240
Do you not see it it's in his interest
for you to believe that?

08:18.320 --> 08:23.240
Murder is a mortal sin, Cosimo.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.880
I showed them mercy.

08:26.960 --> 08:31.440
I let them go...
and they were killed by bandits.

08:31.520 --> 08:36.080
And a mortal sinner's soul burns
in everlasting fire

08:36.160 --> 08:40.080
unless he confesses and truly repents!

08:40.160 --> 08:42.240
If there is any truth in these rumors,

08:42.320 --> 08:45.000
one day,
you will have to confront that fact!

08:45.080 --> 08:47.360
You know that, don't you?

08:57.120 --> 09:00.040
God may be merciful.

09:00.120 --> 09:04.400
But it is absolutely inconceivable
that a murderer

09:04.480 --> 09:06.240
could ever be the Papal banker.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.800
Have you seen Maddalena
be sick like that before?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.720
Not Maddalena, no.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.240
Do you think it had something to do
with Marco Bello leaving?

09:25.960 --> 09:29.800
-May I speak freely, Madonna Contessina?
-Of course.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.920
I'm the oldest of 14 children,
and my poor mother...

09:33.000 --> 09:37.320
God rest her soul, lost a few too.
I know all the signs.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.280
You think she's with child?

09:41.360 --> 09:44.760
With Marco Bello's child, yes.
And you can take my word for that.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.520
-How can you be so sure?
-If I may speak freely--

09:50.600 --> 09:51.880
Yes, speak freely!

09:51.960 --> 09:54.560
Believe me, there are no secrets
in the servant's quarters.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.960
Messer Cosimo stopped visiting
the slave girl weeks ago.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
Yes, I'm aware of that.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.760
At the same time, she started
making cow eyes at Marco Bello.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.040
But now that he's gone,
she may try to protect herself

10:08.120 --> 10:11.200
by claiming her mongrel's a Medici,
but your husband is not the father.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.600
--Come in.

10:30.040 --> 10:34.080
-I've come to say goodbye.
-Why?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.720
I was wrong to accuse you
of Father's murder.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.400
That you could even think it
for a second, Cosimo.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.280
I don't think
that I can ever forgive you for that.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.680
The Pope is withdrawing his account
and giving it to Pazzi.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.040
- That's unfortunate.
- Unfortunate?

11:01.400 --> 11:05.320
This could mean the end for our bank.
I need you by my side, brother.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.480
Then perhaps you should have thought
about that before.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.600
Hear him out, Lorenzo.
Your brother has done you a great wrong

11:10.680 --> 11:14.360
but he needs your help. We all do.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.640
Leave us to talk, Contessina.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.240
I am truly sorry, brother.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.960
Will you forgive me?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.360
You accept that I did not kill our father.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.000
And yet you do nothing
to pursue the man who did.

11:56.080 --> 12:01.040
Marco had no motive to kill our father.
Unless someone paid him.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.800
Albizzi.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.920
-Pazzi.
-He paid someone to kill Bredani.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.320
He means to destroy this family,

12:12.400 --> 12:15.480
this republic,
our entire vision for Florence.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.320
Your entire vision for Florence, Cosimo.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.840
I will search for proof that Pazzi
was behind Bredani's murder.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.360
If you can prove that,
it would turn the Pope against Pazzi.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.080
And... save this family.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.400
He wouldn't have dirtied his hands
by doing the deed himself.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.840
He admitted as much this morning.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.960
He boasted all his men have alibis
for Bredani's death.

12:43.040 --> 12:47.120
-Then I'm looking for a professional.
-Thank you.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.320
-For doing this.
-I'm not doing this for you.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.240
When you were asked to marry Piero,
do you remember how you felt?

13:04.600 --> 13:05.640
Excited.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.280
Was that love?

13:09.280 --> 13:11.960
Or the prospect of joining
such a powerful family?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.320
Be honest.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.480
I may be his mother,
but I was also a bride once.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.760
It was both. I suppose.

13:25.840 --> 13:30.360
-And I count my blessings every day.
-My wedding was a transaction.

13:31.960 --> 13:38.760
But I grew to like him, admire
and even love my husband sometimes.

13:38.840 --> 13:42.840
His... his sheer power.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.680
He'd make any woman proud.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.160
And now I find myself wondering
about some of the things he may have done.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.280
What is it?

13:51.360 --> 13:52.720
His concubine is pregnant.

13:54.920 --> 13:55.960
She's pregnant?

14:04.240 --> 14:08.200
For some women falling pregnant,
it's all too easy.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.000
Emilia thinks that Marco Bello
is the father.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.320
And it's true Cosimo
hasn't lain with her for weeks.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.560
But the baby could change
the way he feels about her.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.200
He looked at me very differently
after I gave him a son.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.160
Sell her.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.240
Sell her in Genoa,
and no one need ever know.

14:28.320 --> 14:32.120
I am sorry. All this talk of children.
I've upset you.

14:34.920 --> 14:39.200
You know what must be done. You always do.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.280
You want me to start preparing
for the transfer?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.760
No, you're coming to Rome with me.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.240
With a bill of exchange
for 40,000 Florins.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.520
To bribe Visconti?

14:50.600 --> 14:52.840
To buy an army strong enough
to retake Rome from Visconti

14:52.920 --> 14:55.800
and get the Pope back where he belongs.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.880
This is no ordinary man.
This is St. Peter's successor.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.640
Popes come and go.
New alliances are made.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.440
Are you sure we're backing
the winner this time?

15:07.920 --> 15:11.320
Sometimes it's not about backing the man
most likely to win.

15:11.400 --> 15:15.480
It's about backing the right man,
making sure he does win.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.000
Do we have any guarantees
he'll change his mind

15:18.080 --> 15:20.800
if this new army succeeds
in retaking Rome?

15:20.880 --> 15:24.320
We'll do the right thing. Let him decide.

15:25.840 --> 15:30.040
If we lose the Papal account,
we could survive.

15:30.120 --> 15:35.480
We'd be small, but we could rebuild.
Live to fight another day.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.480
But spending so much on this army...

15:38.560 --> 15:40.720
I have left instruction with Piero.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.400
And he will speak tomorrow
at the Signoria,

15:42.480 --> 15:47.440
persuade them to raise a one-off tax
to reimburse us. I know it's a risk.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.760
But we are not only fighting
for the Medici legacy,

15:52.840 --> 15:56.120
we are fighting for the future
of the Christian faith.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.480
Father is leaving me in charge.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.760
But last time I spoke at the Signoria,
I made a complete fool of myself.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.360
You won the vote.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.040
Only because of yours
and my mother's bribes.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.920
And there will be no chance
of bribery tomorrow.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.680
The future of the bank could rest
on the power of my rhetoric.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.200
And I don't even know
if they'll allow me to speak.

16:22.280 --> 16:26.440
You'll speak.
And you will speak magnificently.

16:26.520 --> 16:30.120
This is a chance for you to prove yourself
and you have to seize it.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.320
Now more than ever.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.920
- I know.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.760
Maddalena might be carrying
Cosimo's child.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
What?

16:41.560 --> 16:43.320
Why are you telling me that now?

16:43.400 --> 16:46.000
If she has a son, and we remain childless,

16:46.080 --> 16:49.600
he may grow up
and be regarded as a potential heir.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.000
Do well tomorrow.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.720
Prove your father is right to give you
this extra responsibility.

16:56.800 --> 17:02.280
And you will establish yourself
as the indisputable heir apparent.

17:23.320 --> 17:27.880
You... get off.
You're not having any more! Push off!

17:27.960 --> 17:30.840
-What do you want?
-Wine.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.240
--And information.

17:33.320 --> 17:37.960
Wine's cheap. The other thing...

17:38.040 --> 17:40.400
- it depends.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.320
-Any strangers staying here last week?
-It's an inn.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.440
Ah, the man I'm looking for
killed someone.

17:56.520 --> 17:57.840
I don't judge my guests.

17:57.920 --> 18:01.640
I think you know the type
that I mean, Bruno.

18:01.720 --> 18:06.000
Big, ugly bastard from Milan.
Dangerous cutthroat.

18:06.080 --> 18:10.080
-It sounds like it might be him.
-My neck's worth a lot more than that.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.200
--How do I know that your information

18:13.280 --> 18:14.960
isn't as bad as your wine?

18:16.160 --> 18:19.040
Because, my friend,
you get what you pay for.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.440
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

18:34.160 --> 18:39.160
His name is Ferzetti.
And he left for Rome yesterday.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.800
-Rome? You sure?
-Yes, I'm certain.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.840
Any other information
that you can give me?

18:44.880 --> 18:47.800
-He wasn't very pretty to look at.
-You mentioned that.

18:47.880 --> 18:53.880
Beautiful horse, though. White stallion.
He ran up quite a big bill.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.600
And I thought he's not gonna be able
to pay this,

18:56.680 --> 18:59.760
and I had my eye on his horse.

18:59.840 --> 19:04.640
Then yesterday, he comes back
from the bank, money bag full,

19:04.720 --> 19:07.080
pays his debt, off he goes.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.960
Was there a crest on this bag?

19:11.200 --> 19:12.200
Let me think.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.600
Oh, come on. You're a banker.
Act like one.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.560
My income versus expenditure
doesn't add up.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.720
It was...

19:28.440 --> 19:29.760
It was the Pazzi.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.360
You're a Medici.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.120
The blood of your father
and your grandfather runs in your veins.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.840
And today
they will speak through you. Hmm?

19:50.760 --> 19:52.680
You can do this, Piero.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.320
Go on. Good luck.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.120
Can we get started, please, gentlemen?

20:10.200 --> 20:13.240
We've got a lot of business
to get through today.

20:19.800 --> 20:24.840
Piero de' Medici will speak
on behalf of the de' Medici bank.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.200
Thank you, Signor Guadagni.

20:26.280 --> 20:30.120
His father is too embarrassed
to show his face.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.000
He leaves what's left
of his business to a boy.

20:37.840 --> 20:38.880
Gentlemen...

20:41.000 --> 20:46.760
- I'm here to propose a new tax.

20:52.360 --> 20:57.800
A new one-off tax to pay for an army,

20:57.880 --> 21:01.160
to get His Holiness, the Pope,
back to Rome.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.800
Quiet!

21:12.280 --> 21:14.160
Have you not had enough of these games?

21:15.760 --> 21:19.240
This is another desperate attempt
by Cosimo de' Medici

21:19.320 --> 21:21.960
to curry favor with the Pope.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.240
When it's an open secret,

21:23.320 --> 21:26.600
that the Holy Father
has washed his hands of him.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.480
And he expects us to pay for it?

21:29.560 --> 21:33.240
Florence is better than Rome.
Let the Pope stay here.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.960
We're already taxed up to our necks.

21:36.040 --> 21:40.880
The families and merchants of this city
cannot afford another tax.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.360
Would you please let him finish
what he came here to say?

21:56.680 --> 21:58.880
It won't be paid
by the families and merchants.

21:58.960 --> 22:03.720
- No! He wants the poor to pay for it!

22:08.640 --> 22:13.160
If Cosimo de' Medici wanted this
to be taken seriously,

22:13.240 --> 22:15.680
he should have come here
to propose it himself.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.200
Rather than humiliate his son.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.000
This new tax...

22:36.080 --> 22:38.560
will not be paid by the families
or merchants or the poor.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.520
The new tax will be paid by the banks!

22:56.240 --> 22:58.680
Is this the force that will conquer Rome?

23:00.880 --> 23:03.360
You there! Where is Bishop Vitelleschi?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.280
- Bishop Vitelleschi?

23:24.360 --> 23:26.160
I'm sorry, there were no guards.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.160
Cosimo de' Medici, banker to the Pope.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.800
You took your time, didn't you?

23:38.200 --> 23:42.040
Signor Guadagni, my father
isn't here, because he's gone to Rome.

23:42.120 --> 23:46.600
To donate 40,000 Florins
to Bishop Vitelleschi.

23:46.680 --> 23:50.440
And that money will enable him
to recruit and equip an army,

23:52.120 --> 23:54.120
capable of taking back Rome.

23:59.520 --> 24:06.120
If... if this assembly votes against
the tax on our banks,

24:06.200 --> 24:09.520
then we Medici...

24:09.600 --> 24:12.840
will cover the entire cost ourselves.

24:17.080 --> 24:21.040
Bishop Vitelleschi's conquest of Rome
will take place,

24:21.120 --> 24:25.200
with or without the support
of the other banks in this city.

24:28.040 --> 24:31.560
But I have complete trust,

24:31.640 --> 24:33.920
that the men
of my much-maligned profession

24:34.000 --> 24:37.280
will follow the Medici lead and prove
they're not just profit-hungry usurers,

24:37.360 --> 24:39.520
but god-fearing men of faith.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.720
Men willing to make sacrifices

24:43.800 --> 24:46.240
for the Holy Father
and the future of Christianity.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.040
And you think this man
can defeat Visconti?

25:08.560 --> 25:12.680
-He is a well-trained and brutal soldier.
-So Rome will burn.

25:14.320 --> 25:18.200
-And many innocent people will die.
-I wish there was another way, Ugo.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.840
I wish with all my heart.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.240
Ready?

25:25.920 --> 25:28.720
We just need the signatures,
Your Excellency.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.120
With this money...

25:31.200 --> 25:34.440
I can annihilate the traitors
on the Papal Council once and for all.

25:34.520 --> 25:38.480
By the time I'm finished,
Rome will look redder than that.

25:39.520 --> 25:44.000
But I've lost many good men,

25:44.080 --> 25:47.000
made many personal sacrifices.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.920
Is there something else you want?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.560
To retain control
of the Papal army afterwards.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.600
If you're victorious,
no one could argue with that.

25:54.680 --> 26:00.320
And also I expect your bank
to secure all my future ventures.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.440
Both holy and secular.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.400
Do we understand each other?

26:16.640 --> 26:20.040
You will be afforded
every economic advantage

26:20.120 --> 26:22.240
the Medici bank has to offer.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.720
Good man.

27:05.440 --> 27:09.160
Stopped off to spend some
of Andrea Pazzi's blood money, did you?

27:09.240 --> 27:10.280
Go.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.160
You've got the wrong man.
I don't know any Andrea Pazzi.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.080
Why do you have this letter
with his seal on it?

27:20.600 --> 27:23.800
I'm a messenger.
I was given that to deliver.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.920
I didn't ask the man's name.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.440
-He hired you to kill Bredani, didn't he?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.040
- But why is he writing to Visconti?

27:34.120 --> 27:36.840
I never killed anyone in my life.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.360
And then again, maybe I have.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.680
Me too.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.000
Step back.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.680
Why did you follow me?

28:13.760 --> 28:15.800
To find out if you were loyal
to your brother.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.000
Why didn't you just let him kill me?

28:20.560 --> 28:21.560
Because you were.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.960
What will you do now?

28:29.360 --> 28:31.840
I'm not going back,
if that's what you mean.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.160
Not with these false accusations
of your father's murder.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.320
You have been a true friend to my brother.

28:45.400 --> 28:49.120
And to me too, it seems.
We were wrong to accuse you.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.880
You were loyal to the family. Thank you.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.320
I want you to tell me the truth.

29:17.880 --> 29:21.360
--I wouldn't lie to you, Madonna.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.720
Do you know who the father
of your child is?

29:26.680 --> 29:28.400
Maddalena, you can't hide it forever.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.000
Do you?

29:31.960 --> 29:35.000
- Yes.
- For certain?

29:37.040 --> 29:38.120
Yes.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.120
Emilia, leave us.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.960
If it's my husband's, you may think
that you can keep your position here.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.240
That your baby will never go hungry.

29:55.320 --> 29:59.440
If it's Marco Bello's,
you seem to have been abandoned.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.760
How could it be Marco Bello's?

30:14.760 --> 30:17.440
I know what goes on in my own household.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.360
And it's no secret
that you and he were close.

30:22.480 --> 30:26.720
If it were his, I would have told him.
And he would have taken me with him.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.480
But I could do no such thing.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.360
Because he always treated me
with respect.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.040
Thank you for your candor.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.480
But if you ever speak to me
like that again,

30:43.560 --> 30:46.480
you'll be on your way
to the slave market in Genoa.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.320
Now get back to work.

31:20.040 --> 31:24.160
Isn't it wonderful?
Piero has just prevailed in the Signoria.

31:24.240 --> 31:28.880
That is wonderful. And it's down
to your faith in him, Lucrezia.

31:28.960 --> 31:33.840
Me? No, it is you who got him this far.
And he'll need you now more than ever.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.520
- I doubt that.
- Of course he will.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.400
We both need you to persuade Cosimo

31:37.480 --> 31:39.640
to let him take his proper place
in the family.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.920
He's ready now.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.200
- That's him.
- It passed unanimously.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.600
Lucrezia.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.320
I was...

31:56.400 --> 31:57.680
magnificent.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.680
No one dared be seen voting
against the Pope.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.120
Even Pazzi himself had to vote in favor.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.640
I am so proud of you, Piero.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.480
And your father will be too.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.440
-You are?
-Yes.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.520
-Hmm? You are.
-Yes.

32:26.440 --> 32:30.120
The likes of Pazzi
will never defeat the Medici.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.120
We are invincible.

32:58.120 --> 33:00.400
-You found him.
-And more besides,

33:00.480 --> 33:04.960
enough to finish Andrea Pazzi for good.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.960
Rinaldo Albizzi once had my brother
locked up in this very cell.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.040
But he prevailed in the end.

33:34.120 --> 33:36.080
And Albizzi
was a far more worthy adversary

33:36.160 --> 33:37.800
than your paymaster will ever be.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.280
When Andrea Pazzi is in here with you,
tell him from me that it doesn't do

33:46.360 --> 33:50.000
-to underestimate the Medici.
-Tell him yourself.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.440
Have you ever killed anyone else for him?

33:53.520 --> 33:55.400
-Apart from Bredani?
-I'm just a messenger.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.600
Confess and your soul may be saved.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.040
Did you have anything to do
with the death of my father?

34:04.120 --> 34:05.800
No.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.920
Who ordered it?

34:12.200 --> 34:13.800
I don't know anything about it.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.080
Pazzi and Albizzi were in league together.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.960
It was one of them.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.320
I don't know.

34:31.240 --> 34:34.720
I swear to you, I don't know.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.120
It doesn't do to underestimate
Andrea Pazzi.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.280
A successful journey?

35:28.480 --> 35:30.840
What's done is done.

35:37.720 --> 35:42.480
A lot has happened while you were away.
Piero has won the vote in the Signoria.

35:43.520 --> 35:46.120
Lorenzo has tracked down Bredani's killer.
He's in the cell.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.720
So despite Pazzi's best efforts,
this family remains strong.

35:51.440 --> 35:55.680
-You always get what you want in the end.
-You're not wearing your necklace.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.240
I took it off. This morning.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.960
I was going to leave you, Cosimo.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.600
-Why?
-Do you really need to ask?

36:16.680 --> 36:19.200
After you lied to me
about your father's death,

36:19.280 --> 36:21.200
your affair with the slave girl,

36:21.280 --> 36:23.160
the deaths of Rinaldo
and Ormanno Albizzi...

36:23.240 --> 36:24.560
-Contessina.
-And now to discover...

36:26.520 --> 36:27.640
that your mistress...

36:30.960 --> 36:34.240
is going to bear your child.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.800
And yet you did not leave.

36:48.600 --> 36:49.600
Messer Medici.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.960
I'm so sorry. I bring terrible news.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.240
Your brother, Messer Lorenzo,

36:58.320 --> 37:01.960
I just found him lying dead
in the cells of the Signoria.

37:03.040 --> 37:04.360
He's been stabbed.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.880
And the killers have escaped.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.400
I'm so sorry.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.320
It will all be worth it, Lorenzo.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.160
It will be worth it.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.240
-What's happened?
-Bishop Vitelleschi has the funds

38:49.320 --> 38:50.640
to retake Rome for you.

38:52.040 --> 38:55.320
I understand there was more
than just your money involved.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.160
I made it happen. Many will die.

38:58.240 --> 39:01.720
Blood will run in the streets
and your position will be secure.

39:03.720 --> 39:08.360
I can only pray that it will be as swift
and painless as possible.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.320
But war is always painful, Cosimo.

39:15.840 --> 39:20.040
Even if sometimes it is justified
when waged for the right reasons.

39:27.120 --> 39:31.160
-You have something else to say, Cosimo?
-Everything I have ever done

39:31.240 --> 39:35.560
has been for Florence, for you,
for the greater glory of God.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.440
I know what lengths you've gone to
to get me back to Rome.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.760
How devout your motives are, I can't say.

39:45.840 --> 39:50.440
But you are mistaken if you think
it will make me reverse my decision

39:50.520 --> 39:54.120
to give Signor Pazzi the Papal account.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.120
My brother Lorenzo
was stabbed to death last night.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.840
I know Pazzi is responsible,
although I cannot prove it.

40:04.920 --> 40:08.080
But this letter proves...

40:09.760 --> 40:12.880
that he has been in league
with Duke Visconti all along.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.000
My brother died for this letter.

40:17.280 --> 40:21.560
Unfortunately, for his assassin,
he had already given it to my wife.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.240
And as you will see...

40:26.560 --> 40:29.760
Pazzi tells Visconti that you have
handed him the Papal account,

40:29.840 --> 40:34.280
and asks him to postpone replacing you
until the bank transfer is complete.

40:35.920 --> 40:40.200
He also brags of having
the olive oil merchant, Bredani, killed,

40:40.280 --> 40:42.680
so he could take his seat in the council.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.480
Now, as it is inconceivable

40:45.560 --> 40:49.160
that the Papal banker
should be a murderer,

40:49.240 --> 40:50.920
this letter proves you need a new banker.

40:53.400 --> 40:57.960
And I, of course,
will be glad to offer my services.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.360
Vitelleschi has prevailed in Rome.

41:18.440 --> 41:21.040
-We are victorious.
-That is a good result.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.440
A result obtained in blood.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.680
He slaughtered his way
to the heart of the curia council.

41:27.760 --> 41:31.800
-You had no choice but to support him.
-A man always has a choice.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.240
If he is willing to lose.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.520
That man has never been you.

41:38.640 --> 41:43.800
My father said it is sometimes necessary
to do bad in order to achieve good.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.200
Now, as Albizzi predicted,
I am more my father than he ever was.

41:49.280 --> 41:54.240
That is why God is punishing me.
By taking my brother.

41:54.320 --> 41:59.200
-Cursing me with this bastard child.
-Lorenzo died fighting for this family.

41:59.280 --> 42:04.240
And bringing new life
into the world is never a curse.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.200
I know what I said.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.040
But perhaps this child
is an opportunity for both of us.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.680
Speak plainly.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.080
You shall raise the child as your own.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.320
We both shall.

42:23.400 --> 42:27.400
Just as Lorenzo would have raised
Rosa's child if he'd had the chance.

42:27.480 --> 42:30.120
I don't understand.

42:30.200 --> 42:35.560
I do not excuse your sins, Cosimo.
It is not my place to do so.

42:35.640 --> 42:39.280
And I have sins of my own.
But as long as we can breathe,

42:39.360 --> 42:42.880
there is a chance
that we can atone for them.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.400
-I don't know if I can, Contessina.
-I will help you.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.840
-Mastro Ugo? May I speak with you?
-Yes.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.080
What is it, Maddalena?

43:38.760 --> 43:42.800
I know they think that Marco Bello
killed their father. But he couldn't have.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.560
The so-called evidence,

43:45.640 --> 43:50.560
the bill of sale for the poison
was found in his saddle bag.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.840
But he only acquired the bag
a fortnight ago.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.520
If you were a murderer,
would you be so foolish

43:56.600 --> 44:00.600
as to transfer the proof of your guilt
from an old bag to a new one?

44:02.720 --> 44:05.840
Someone put it there
to make him look guilty.

44:05.920 --> 44:08.400
Someone from this household.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.800
You mustn't breathe a word of this.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.880
-But--
-Listen to me.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.160
Marco Bello has left.

44:15.240 --> 44:19.120
And nothing, not even his exoneration,
will bring him back.

44:20.520 --> 44:23.360
But your place here is tenuous at best.

44:25.480 --> 44:30.280
Trust an old man who has served
this family for many years.

44:30.360 --> 44:33.880
This matter is best left alone.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.520
- Father was murdered.
- You know who did it?

44:55.600 --> 45:00.000
Power brings enemies.
Your father had many.

45:00.080 --> 45:02.080
The bill of sale of Master Tancredi.

45:02.160 --> 45:04.360
I need the name of the customer
who bought it.

45:04.440 --> 45:07.320
- I don't have it.
- Find it.

45:13.240 --> 45:15.920
Surely he would never admit
to such a crime.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.560
- No. Not freely.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.800
Alerting the killer
will only make him harder to catch.

45:30.880 --> 45:34.440
I will have justice.
Once I know who did it.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.240
There is nothing to argue about.

45:36.320 --> 45:40.680
You will no longer be a Medici
if you marry a girl who sells oranges.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.360
- I will marry her.
- You will not!

45:47.600 --> 45:53.400
The young girl,
Rosa and her child, they're dead.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.520
It's probably for the best.

46:05.160 --> 46:08.560
I judge the whole vineyard
by this one vine,

46:08.640 --> 46:12.400
and when it's ready,
I know it's time to harvest.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.240
This is good. Tomorrow, better.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.720
The day after that, perfect.

46:20.800 --> 46:24.440
I thought that I was taking her
to a place of sanctuary.

46:24.520 --> 46:28.080
But it was a place of punishment. Hell.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.360
This is God's will, Ugo.

46:31.920 --> 46:35.200
God's will. Not mine.

46:35.280 --> 46:39.040
You gave me the order!

46:39.120 --> 46:42.240
I carried it out!

46:44.800 --> 46:47.920
What will God's judgment be on us?

46:48.000 --> 46:53.640
A stallion may mount a donkey
and get a mule. I like mules.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.880
Ugo, I ride mules.

46:56.880 --> 47:00.880
But there will never be a mule
in the Medici family.

47:00.960 --> 47:02.480
Do you understand?

47:04.040 --> 47:05.120
Of course.

47:07.440 --> 47:09.400
Remember your place.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.160
Who's there?

48:18.800 --> 48:22.240
Excuse me.
Messer Cosimo, Madonna Contessina.

48:22.320 --> 48:24.160
The ceremony is about to begin.

48:24.240 --> 48:30.160
And Florence cannot have its procession
of the Magi without the Medici.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.480
Thank you, Ugo.

48:37.560 --> 48:39.040
Forgive me, Cosimo.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.640
I heard some of what you said
through the door.

48:43.240 --> 48:46.280
You have not become your father.

48:47.640 --> 48:49.440
You're a better man than he ever was.

49:46.440 --> 49:50.000
That mule isn't the only thing
carrying precious cargo.

49:52.240 --> 49:55.600
You're with child? Are you sure?

49:55.680 --> 49:57.920
It will be a boy. We're sure of it.

49:59.880 --> 50:02.680
And we'll call him Lorenzo.
