WEBVTT

00:14.275 --> 00:15.493
Shaxs has the gym in 20,

00:15.537 --> 00:17.060
but we should have time
for a quick round.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.193
Ooh, you guys gonna go 'anbo?
Can I get in on that?

00:19.236 --> 00:21.108
Sure! More the merrier.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.500
Three months of midnight
practice

00:22.544 --> 00:23.893
-is finally gonna pay off.

00:23.936 --> 00:26.374
Can't wait to see the
look on her face.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.076
Glad you're still into this.
I was worried

00:33.120 --> 00:34.904
maybe I came down
too hard on you last time.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.819
Hopefully we picked up
a few of your moves.

00:36.862 --> 00:40.127
Nothing like some friendly
Anbo-jyutsu to work up a sweat.

00:45.001 --> 00:47.090
Ha. We've been training on
the holodeck at night.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.092
You might want to take off
the kid gloves.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.528
Oh. Ah...

00:50.572 --> 00:53.009
-Are you okay? I didn't mean...
-I'm great.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.316
I can finally
get in a real workout.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.318
Uh...

01:02.192 --> 01:03.715
Oh, God.
No, no, no, no!

01:08.111 --> 01:10.200
Ah! Ah!

01:10.244 --> 01:13.725
Put the kid gloves on!
Put the kid gloves on!

01:13.769 --> 01:14.944
Shaxs! Help!

01:14.987 --> 01:16.859
Don't worry about me,
I'm early.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.121
You've still got ten minutes.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.024
Well, if raktajino makes you
all jumpy,

02:35.067 --> 02:37.113
then just switch to
human coffee.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.201
Eh, I tried,

02:38.245 --> 02:39.202
-but it's too weak...

02:39.246 --> 02:41.335
Shh! Did you hear something?

02:43.075 --> 02:44.381
Ah. Ah, ah, ah, ah...

02:44.425 --> 02:45.469
-Ah!

02:51.649 --> 02:55.653
<i>Captain's log,</i>

02:55.697 --> 02:57.916
<i>the</i> Cerritos <i>is en route
to Frylon IV</i>

02:57.960 --> 03:00.745
<i>to investigate the reported
sighting of a mugato,</i>

03:00.789 --> 03:03.705
<i>a dangerous creature not
indigenous to this planet.</i>

03:03.748 --> 03:06.621
"Poisonous, carnivorous,
strength of ten men."

03:06.664 --> 03:08.318
Huh, sounds like my ex.

03:08.362 --> 03:11.234
I can't believe we pulled
another animal control op,

03:11.278 --> 03:14.237
as if there weren't more
important jobs for us to do.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.414
The bio-electrical signatures
on Frylon has made it difficult

03:17.458 --> 03:18.894
to pinpoint life signs,

03:18.937 --> 03:21.331
but with boots on the ground,
we'll find her.

03:23.899 --> 03:27.250
Let's see, hmm, hmm, hmm...
What about...

03:27.294 --> 03:29.948
a ten percent gratuity
on a biannual basis?

03:29.992 --> 03:31.254
Hmm, worth considering...

03:31.298 --> 03:32.734
-What up?!
Ah!

03:32.777 --> 03:34.344
Wow, flinch much?
Hey, work later.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.694
Let's hit the phaser range.
I need moving targets.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.261
This isn't work,
we're playing Diplomath.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.524
And, we're at a crucial point
in the negotiation.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.092
-We're both about to lose!
-Why is that good?

03:43.135 --> 03:44.789
If both sides are equally
unsatisfied

03:44.833 --> 03:46.922
with the negotiation,
you can close the deal!

03:46.965 --> 03:48.445
Ready for final offers?

03:49.359 --> 03:52.797
-Eh, I don't like it.
-I guess I can live with that.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.278
-That's a compromise!
-Oh, boy.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.454
I'd say you guys should take up
a less-embarrassing hobby,

03:57.498 --> 03:58.847
but it might be too late.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.155
Honus!
Can we get two more?

04:03.199 --> 04:05.157
Yeah, maybe with some
pain reliever mixed in?

04:05.201 --> 04:08.117
Ah, yeah. Not surprised
you fellas need a drink

04:08.160 --> 04:10.815
after talkin' with that
powder keg friend of yours.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.208
Huh? You talking about Mariner?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.080
If'n that's her real name.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.605
Haven't you boys ever wondered
how she's able to

04:17.648 --> 04:21.696
kick so much ass and get away
with whatever she wants?

04:21.739 --> 04:24.394
Uh, 'cause her mom's the captain
and she practices kicking a lot?

04:24.438 --> 04:25.569
Usually on us.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.441
Workin' the bar, I hear a lot

04:27.484 --> 04:29.225
of inside information.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.402
Your friend is a specially
trained secret agent

04:32.446 --> 04:35.536
for Starfleet black ops.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.799
-Ha-ha-ha. Shut up, Honus!
-Yeah, right, okay, man.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.584
I'm telling you, they made her
into a killing machine.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.803
The perfect weapon.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.283
We spend all of our time
with Mariner.

04:43.326 --> 04:46.024
Pretty sure we'd know
if she was "the perfect weapon."

04:46.068 --> 04:47.374
Most of the time
she's napping.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.811
Of course she does.
Captain's daughter,

04:49.854 --> 04:51.726
friends with the
softest guys on the ship;

04:51.769 --> 04:53.075
it's the perfect cover.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.816
Haven't you ever noticed
that she seems to know

04:54.859 --> 04:56.208
every fightin' style?

04:56.252 --> 04:57.949
She is a master of
Anbo-jyutsu...

04:57.993 --> 05:00.343
Look, we may be soft,
but we're not gullible.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.085
Just watch out. When her back's
against the wall,

05:03.128 --> 05:05.130
that's when
the training kicks in.

05:05.174 --> 05:09.134
She's programmed to protect
herself at all costs.

05:10.745 --> 05:14.096
All costs.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.316
Okay, buddy, you heard wrong.

05:16.359 --> 05:19.406
I bet they didn't believe the
rumors on the <i>Atlantis</i> either,

05:19.449 --> 05:21.408
until it was too late,
and they were all...

05:21.451 --> 05:23.061
Honus, could you get
back to work?!

05:23.105 --> 05:25.107
Billups is still waiting
on his peach daiquiri.

05:25.150 --> 05:28.023
Ah, keep your pips on, Billups.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.633
-That guy's so full of it.
-Yeah, right?

05:29.677 --> 05:31.940
As if Starfleet would ever hide
a black ops agent

05:31.983 --> 05:33.376
-on one of their own ships.
-Yeah.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.291
I mean, Starfleet Intelligence
does it.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.293
And Tuvok did it when
he infiltrated the Maquis.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.164
And there were a ton during
the Dominion War.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.558
But on the <i>Cerritos?
Yeah, right.</i>

05:42.820 --> 05:45.257
Yeah, right...

05:48.173 --> 05:50.437
Oh! Looks like we have
a spike in the subcortical.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.742
Let's move, people!

05:51.786 --> 05:54.005
I need 30cc's of
desalinated paviatic fluid.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.877
-On it.
-Uh, technically,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.139
that's my patient.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.183
Clear the area!

05:58.227 --> 05:59.576
That's fine. I...

05:59.620 --> 06:02.318
Ensign Tendi, my office.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.581
I'm sorry, Doctor, I know you
said I need to be

06:04.625 --> 06:06.278
-more assertive, I just...
-Okay, okay, whatever.

06:06.322 --> 06:09.064
This is a list of crew who've
avoided their annual physicals.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.719
But why? The biometric scan
is non-invasive.

06:11.762 --> 06:14.330
Some freaks hate being
reduced to a set of readings.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.593
I need you to hunt them down
and scan their asses.

06:16.637 --> 06:17.942
You got what it takes?

06:17.986 --> 06:19.814
Yes! Thank you for this
opportunity.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.424
I won't let you down.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.557
So I was reading up
on the mugatos.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.950
Did you know they have
alternative pronunciations?

06:25.994 --> 06:28.300
Mogatu, mugutu, and gumato.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.911
Isn't that neat
and inconsistent?

06:29.954 --> 06:31.347
-Mm.
-Dude, I'm talking

06:31.391 --> 06:32.435
alien pronunciations here.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.436
That's, like,
your favorite thing.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.481
-What's up?
-Check this out.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.352
Mariner's record.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
Don't tell me you actually
believe that bartender.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.443
Mariner has served
on a lot of ships.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.227
Because she's always
getting demoted.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.620
Yeah. That's what <i>she</i> says.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.448
Look. When she served
on the <i>Atlantis,</i>

06:45.492 --> 06:47.363
half the crew
mysteriously vanished.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.017
I'm sure it was just
a reassignment.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.410
A hundred reassignments?
Plus,

06:50.453 --> 06:52.150
there's nothing
in the logs about it.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.457
Just one day, poof, all gone.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.981
That is weird. You don't think
she had anything to do with it?

06:57.025 --> 06:59.723
-Who to do with what?

06:59.767 --> 07:02.117
-Whoa! You guys see that?

07:02.160 --> 07:04.946
-What's got you so jumpy?

07:04.989 --> 07:06.643
Just excited to see a mugato.

07:06.687 --> 07:10.517
Oh, you would be. Just stay out
of my way down there. Or else.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.909
Aah! Or else what?

07:11.953 --> 07:13.955
I don't know, we'll get poisoned
by a mugato.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.044
You guys are so weird sometimes.

07:20.352 --> 07:23.834
Shaxs, our sensors indicate
a storm moving in.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.619
You've got less than 22 minutes

07:25.662 --> 07:26.968
<i>before we lose comms.</i>

07:27.011 --> 07:29.100
Copy that, Captain.
You all got the briefing.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.755
No weapons.
These mugutus are endangered,

07:31.799 --> 07:34.454
and their genitals
are sensitive to phaser fire.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.116
All right, fan out.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.554
This is where we detected
a gumato life sign.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.645
Ah, what have we here?

07:51.688 --> 07:54.212
-Mugato dung.
-Ew!

07:54.256 --> 07:56.737
-Fresh. Tangy.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.392
She doesn't seem dangerous.

08:00.436 --> 08:01.872
I think we're being
silly billies.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.222
Even if Mariner was black ops,
which she is not,

08:04.266 --> 08:05.528
that bartender said
she'd only flip out

08:05.572 --> 08:07.138
if her back was against
the wall.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.923
This is just one random
mugato, we're fine.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.758
Yo, it's pretty clear we're
going in the right direction.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.760
You don't have to...

08:19.803 --> 08:21.152
Mm-hmm.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.417
Oh.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.205
Ferengi.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.257
Clear them out, fools.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.346
I need to show off
the fresh merchandise.

08:41.390 --> 08:44.654
I'll take a dozen horns.
Are they horns or tusks?

08:44.698 --> 08:46.308
They're whatever
you want them to be,

08:46.351 --> 08:49.398
as long as your latinum's
gold-pressed.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.443
They're harvesting
these animals.

08:51.487 --> 08:52.967
Boimler to <i>Cerritos.</i>

08:53.010 --> 08:54.316
Look, they've got a signal
dampener.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.839
It's jamming this whole area.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.319
Looks like we're on our own.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.887
Just how I like it,
backs against the wall.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.410
I think we should
retreat and...

09:01.453 --> 09:03.238
-Let's move.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.068
Starfleet!

09:07.111 --> 09:09.636
Ferengi poachers,
you are violating

09:09.679 --> 09:12.464
the conservation laws
of Federation space.

09:12.508 --> 09:15.424
Oh, this is Federation space?

09:15.467 --> 09:17.034
I didn't know that.
Did you know that?

09:17.078 --> 09:20.516
Oh, thank the maker you're here.
I was being attacked by these...

09:20.560 --> 09:22.431
You were purchasing
illegal horns.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.346
Stand down and prepare
to be searched.

09:24.389 --> 09:28.176
Hey, no need for all this.
We're licensed businessmen.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.831
Oh, really?
You have a permit?

09:30.874 --> 09:33.529
Yes, a permit to whip you!

09:41.276 --> 09:43.365
Mugato stampede!
-Take cover!

09:52.896 --> 09:55.682
-What do we do?!
-I don't know! Where's Shaxs?!

09:55.725 --> 09:59.599
No! Aah...

09:59.642 --> 10:02.123
It's real.
She's going to kill us!

10:03.733 --> 10:05.779
But there's mugatos out there!

10:05.822 --> 10:07.476
Yeah, but she's in here!

10:16.137 --> 10:17.704
<i>Captain,
we have an unknown ship</i>

10:17.747 --> 10:18.879
<i>leaving the planet's orbit.</i>

10:18.922 --> 10:21.229
-One occupant.
-Hail them.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.579
<i>Leave me alone.
I don't have any horns.</i>

10:23.623 --> 10:26.669
What? I just want to know if
you encountered our away team.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.019
Not interested.
Don't hail me again.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.500
Wha-- Put a tractor beam
on that ship.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.937
I think we need to have
a little chat.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.116
Captain, his ship--
the hull's integrity's failing.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.641
What the--
Emergency transport, now!

10:43.033 --> 10:45.514
What in the name of...

10:45.557 --> 10:46.907
My ship!

10:46.950 --> 10:48.648
I said the tractor beam!

10:48.691 --> 10:51.520
It was, Captain!
At the lowest tractor factor.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.958
My whole life was on that ship.
What have you done?

10:57.569 --> 10:59.528
We need to get out of range of
their signal dampeners,

10:59.571 --> 11:01.965
put some distance between us and
Mariner, and contact the ship.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.401
Was she eating Shaxs?

11:03.445 --> 11:04.620
That's freakin' crazy, man,
that's just...

11:07.405 --> 11:09.625
-Go!

11:22.464 --> 11:25.293
Easy, mates.
You're safe with me.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.164
Great. Uh, who are you?

11:27.208 --> 11:28.644
I'm Patingi.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.778
The renowned biologist?

11:31.821 --> 11:35.433
I have five books on mugatos.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.261
For real? Can you
help us get out of here?

11:37.305 --> 11:38.828
Of course, mates.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.657
I've been studying these
beautiful mooga-toes for years.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.963
I'll walk you right to safety.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.705
-Oh, you're the best, Patingi!
-I know.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.925
Come on. Stay low. Follow me.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.016
-Man, Patingi rules.
-Right?

11:54.801 --> 11:57.368
H-Hi, Lieutenant!
Sorry to bother you,

11:57.412 --> 11:58.848
but it says here that you
haven't come in

11:58.892 --> 12:01.068
-for your annual physical?
-Uh, I'm pretty busy.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.591
I'll get to it when I get to it.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.245
Well, actually,
time is of the essence, and...

12:04.288 --> 12:07.248
I said I'm busy.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.556
Patingi, are we gonna be
in your next book?

12:11.600 --> 12:13.733
Hmm? Oh, no,
I don't write, mate.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.909
I've <i>read</i> five books
on moo-goes.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.476
-Wait. What?
-Yeah, I figured I knew enough

12:18.520 --> 12:20.174
to walk amongst them.

12:22.306 --> 12:25.048
-See? I'm like one of their own.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.138
Aah! Patingi!

12:28.182 --> 12:31.272
-♪

12:35.319 --> 12:37.626
I'm really committed to fitness.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.671
I spot Ransom, like,
all the time.

12:39.715 --> 12:40.803
We're really good pals.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.631
Lemme get another...

12:42.674 --> 12:44.938
Thank you for the DNA scan,
Lieutenant.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.070
Ooh, it says here you
should be drinking more milk

12:47.114 --> 12:49.159
-because your bones are so weak.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.553
Hey, don't listen to her,
I'm as strong as...

12:51.596 --> 12:53.860
-Oh, God, my hip!

12:53.903 --> 12:57.254
Stevens to T'Ana.
Emergency transport.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.567
If we ever get off
this planet,

13:05.610 --> 13:07.047
we'll have to
turn in Mariner, won't we?

13:07.090 --> 13:09.092
Yeah. Feels bad,
reporting anyone in Starfleet,

13:09.136 --> 13:10.615
much less a friend.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.139
Was she our friend?
Or were we just cover for...

13:12.182 --> 13:13.793
-Shh!

13:16.665 --> 13:19.537
Quick. In there.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.154
-Aah!

13:28.982 --> 13:30.200
What are they doing?

13:30.244 --> 13:32.899
Oh, God, they're mating.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.602
-Ah...

13:40.645 --> 13:43.213
-We're gonna drown.
-Come on, come on.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.522
Crap! Another one!

13:51.221 --> 13:53.180
Oh, this could get
violent if he tries

13:53.223 --> 13:54.659
to assert dominance.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.363
Is he asserting?

14:02.406 --> 14:05.322
No. I-I think he likes to watch.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.371
All right, who's next?

14:29.956 --> 14:32.132
Huh.

14:32.175 --> 14:35.135
Who are you?

14:35.178 --> 14:37.615
Okay, they wore themselves out.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.966
Ew, gross.
Even the watcher.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.316
Do you think the captain knows
Mariner's undercover?

14:42.359 --> 14:43.665
Probably her idea.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.101
Oh, man, so the
mom-and-daughter thing

14:45.145 --> 14:46.276
was all an act.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.364
We were so stupid

14:47.408 --> 14:48.583
-not to see it.
-Wait.

14:49.323 --> 14:52.456
Watch it. Mugato trap.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.590
-Hi!
-Aah! Run!

14:55.633 --> 14:56.939
What the hell are
you two doing?!

14:58.985 --> 15:00.508
Guys, quick!
The Ferengi are coming.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.857
You've gotta get me out
of here so...

15:01.901 --> 15:03.511
So you can eat us,
just like Shaxs?!

15:03.554 --> 15:05.469
-What?!
-We saw it, Mariner.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.514
Back there at the compound.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.690
Shaxs was stung by a mugato!

15:08.733 --> 15:10.126
Yeah, and you stabbed him
and licked his blood.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.954
They really messed you up good
in that lab.

15:11.998 --> 15:15.131
I had to suck the venom out!
What lab?

15:15.175 --> 15:16.524
We know what you really are.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.960
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
did you find out

15:18.004 --> 15:19.527
that I'm a black ops
secret agent?

15:19.570 --> 15:21.964
-You aren't even hiding it?!
-Section 31!

15:22.008 --> 15:23.574
I am not a spy, guys.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.054
Then how did you know?

15:25.098 --> 15:26.490
Because I started that rumor.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.275
Yeah, right,
more black ops lies.

15:28.318 --> 15:31.278
No, really, that was me.
Look, I like having a mystique.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.627
Even if we did believe you,

15:32.670 --> 15:33.976
how do you explain
the <i>Atlantis?</i>

15:34.020 --> 15:35.108
Half the crew
disappeared with no explanation.

15:35.151 --> 15:36.413
Did you eat them?

15:36.457 --> 15:37.675
The <i>Atlantis?</i>

15:37.719 --> 15:39.721
No, everyone
got Kerplickian lice.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.288
Of course Starfleet Command
didn't put it

15:41.331 --> 15:42.680
in the official records.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.465
Do you know
how embarrassing it is

15:44.508 --> 15:46.728
to lose a starship to lice?

15:46.771 --> 15:48.251
Why are you so good
at martial arts?

15:48.295 --> 15:49.992
Because it's a sport I can
practice on my own,

15:50.036 --> 15:52.081
because on every ship,
I never have friends who--

15:52.125 --> 15:54.823
Wait, you-you looked up
my records?

15:54.866 --> 15:58.044
You guys, you thought I was
an undercover killer?

15:58.087 --> 16:00.002
Ow! What the hell?!

16:00.046 --> 16:01.873
-Oh, I thought you just...
-Because before you did, and

16:01.917 --> 16:03.353
-it was like you were a ninja.
-...might catch the tricorder...

16:03.397 --> 16:05.703
Yeah, but-- That's all it took
is a lucky catch?

16:05.747 --> 16:07.140
You shouldn't have started
that rumor.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.750
I mean,
"Kill anything in her way"?

16:08.793 --> 16:10.099
Why would you want people
to think that?

16:10.143 --> 16:12.188
Because it keeps jerks
away from me.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.147
But I can't believe you guys
would ever believe that.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.713
You're my best friends.

16:15.757 --> 16:18.194
I-I think we believed because
that part made sense.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.370
That a badass like you wouldn't
really be friends

16:20.414 --> 16:21.719
with guys like us.

16:21.763 --> 16:24.244
-Aw, guys, I... Oh, crap.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.376
-It's too late. Hide.
-We're not leaving you!

16:26.420 --> 16:29.336
The Ferengi got everyone else.
It's up to you guys!

16:29.379 --> 16:30.728
But what do we do?

16:30.772 --> 16:32.339
You have to be the black ops
super spies.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.210
Kick their asses!

16:39.215 --> 16:42.088
Ah, what a catch. Take her!

16:56.972 --> 16:58.756
Any luck with those physicals?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.932
I'm almost done,
just one holdout left.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.847
Really?
I'm impressed, Ensign.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.762
This last one, it's weird.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.199
It's not even a name,

17:06.242 --> 17:08.070
-it's just a serial number.
-Ah.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.203
Well, probably just an error
in the system.

17:10.246 --> 17:13.380
It's almost as if someone erased
their information.

17:13.423 --> 17:15.425
Yeah, I mean, there's always one
that slips through the cracks.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.210
We've wasted enough time
on this. Come on.

17:17.253 --> 17:20.082
Ugh, I just really wanted
to finish this job for you.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.128
Enough! Go back to
your station, Ensign.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.915
That number.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.743
You're the last holdout?

17:30.962 --> 17:33.400
Congratulations. You got me.

17:33.443 --> 17:36.185
I-I just don't understand.
Why not just get your exam?

17:36.229 --> 17:39.101
You want me to see a doctor?
I am the doctor!

17:39.145 --> 17:40.798
When I picked you for this job,

17:40.842 --> 17:42.931
I was counting on you
to give up.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.672
Maybe the old Tendi
was a pushover,

17:44.715 --> 17:47.892
but a lot's changed
since slightly earlier today.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.940
All right, let's just
get this over with.

17:51.983 --> 17:55.552
-Get back here!

17:55.596 --> 17:58.903
Bad Dr. T'Ana. Bad!

18:10.219 --> 18:12.265
Mr. Hyde, while we can't
replace your ship,

18:12.308 --> 18:15.616
I can offer you one of our
shuttlecrafts.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.183
I think that's more than fair.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.358
Hmm...

18:18.401 --> 18:20.447
Uh, Captain, don't you think
Starfleet

18:20.490 --> 18:21.404
would frown on that?

18:21.448 --> 18:23.145
We're helping a traveler
in need.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.974
We'll just tell them we lost
the shuttle in a black hole.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.193
Wouldn't be the first.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.282
Oh, I had so many personal items

18:29.325 --> 18:30.805
aboard the <i>Ladyjane</i> too,

18:30.848 --> 18:32.285
that could never be replaced.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.025
We're talking rare antiques.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.767
-Like what?
-Oh, an old model sailing ship,

18:36.811 --> 18:41.250
a nautilus shell, bronze
pineapple, little Gorn doll.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.557
These hold special meaning
to me.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.516
Well, I guess we have
similar taste.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.748
I wish Mariner was
a super soldier.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.619
Or if only we had
special powers.

19:02.663 --> 19:06.319
Wait, we do. I mean,
maybe not here, but here.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.711
-Our skin!
-Our brains.

19:07.755 --> 19:08.886
-Brains, right.
-It's our brains.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.497
Brains are inside of our skins.

19:18.766 --> 19:22.204
I treat over 100
different species on this ship.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.206
I think I'd know if I'm healthy.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.295
Then just let me scan you!

19:26.339 --> 19:28.384
I don't need a second opinion.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.693
My arm!

19:32.736 --> 19:33.955
It's broken!

19:33.998 --> 19:35.870
Oh, nice, the old
"fake an injury" thing?

19:35.913 --> 19:38.220
Yeah, I'm not gonna fall for--
Oh, [bleep]!

19:38.264 --> 19:41.223
God, kid, I'm sorry.
This is all my...

19:42.529 --> 19:45.532
Got ya.

19:45.575 --> 19:48.796
Well played.
That was actually kinda quick.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.972
I don't know why I made
such a big thing of it.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.322
You know you guys can just
replicate stuff, right?

19:53.366 --> 19:55.411
Like the-the stuff you buy
with latinum,

19:55.455 --> 19:57.326
you could just replicate.
You guys are dumb.

19:57.370 --> 20:01.504
If we're so dumb, then how did
we capture you, human?

20:01.548 --> 20:03.202
You guys are what,
some creepy throwback

20:03.245 --> 20:05.508
<i>Last Outpost</i> style Ferengi?
You ever heard of Quark?

20:05.552 --> 20:07.118
Of course I've heard of Quark!

20:07.162 --> 20:09.730
-♪

20:09.773 --> 20:11.253
Starfleet!

20:11.297 --> 20:14.387
Hey, Ferengi! We've got
a little somethin' for ya!

20:14.430 --> 20:17.477
May we present...

20:17.520 --> 20:20.958
a cost/benefit analysis
for greater long-term profits.

20:21.002 --> 20:25.136
What if I told you
you could earn 150% more latinum

20:25.180 --> 20:27.878
with live mugatos
rather than dead ones?

20:27.922 --> 20:31.142
Stay your whip.
What do you propose?

20:31.186 --> 20:32.448
Well...

20:32.492 --> 20:34.407
By ending the sale
or slaughter of the mugato

20:34.450 --> 20:36.322
while putting an investment
in the conversion

20:36.365 --> 20:38.541
of this place into more
of a mugato preserve...

20:38.585 --> 20:41.327
Your long-term revenue streams
will come to include

20:41.370 --> 20:45.853
ticket prices, merchandise,
concessions-- the whole gumato!

20:48.638 --> 20:50.466
Oh, Mariner,
wh-what's happening?

20:50.510 --> 20:53.600
Those two beautiful, nerdy men
are negotiating us to safety

20:53.643 --> 20:56.472
using the power of math.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.736
It is a more
time-consuming effort

20:59.780 --> 21:01.172
than our current operation,

21:01.216 --> 21:04.001
but I can't argue
with the profit margin.

21:04.045 --> 21:06.700
Though I don't love
releasing captives.

21:06.743 --> 21:09.485
Well, technically we really
should be apprehending you

21:09.529 --> 21:11.487
for attacking members
of Starfleet, so...

21:11.531 --> 21:14.273
If we're both unhappy,
that means we've reached...

21:14.316 --> 21:16.927
A compromise!
-Compromise.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.150
Mugutu venom can have
latent effects,

21:22.193 --> 21:23.630
so I'll need to check
on you later.

21:23.673 --> 21:26.197
In your quarters.

21:26.241 --> 21:31.202
I just got my physical.
I could heal you all night.

21:34.249 --> 21:37.165
Okay, people! It's go time!

21:37.208 --> 21:40.734
No, I've got this! Gimme 20cc's
of space, all right?!

21:40.777 --> 21:42.170
Now that's confidence.

21:42.213 --> 21:44.085
You really showed me something
today, kid.

21:44.128 --> 21:46.261
-Thank you, Doctor.
-But this isn't your patient,

21:46.305 --> 21:47.436
so get the
out of our way.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.872
Yes, Doctor.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.875
Leaving the Frylon system now.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.225
Oh, you're gonna love this.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.097
We made contact with a group of

21:56.140 --> 21:58.491
-eco-friendly Ferengi. <i>
-Really?</i>

21:58.534 --> 22:01.537
Apparently they're looking
to nurture abandoned mugato.

22:01.581 --> 22:04.453
Setting up a whole preserve.
Very noble.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.542
<i>That's outstanding.
Oh, before you go,</i>

22:06.586 --> 22:08.892
<i>you haven't had any
recent ship accidents, have you?</i>

22:08.936 --> 22:12.374
-Uh, no, nothing here. <i>
-Okay, good.</i>

22:12.418 --> 22:15.072
<i>We've had some reports of a scam
being run in that sector.</i>

22:15.116 --> 22:17.597
<i>Junk ship will purposefully
self-destruct</i>

22:17.640 --> 22:18.989
<i>and try to pin it on Starfleet.</i>

22:19.033 --> 22:21.340
We'll be sure
to look out for that.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.560
<i>Did you redecorate?
Something looks different.</i>

22:28.434 --> 22:30.610
Way I see it, you can either
pay for your crimes

22:30.653 --> 22:32.612
in a Federation penal colony,

22:32.655 --> 22:36.224
or we can pretend you never
pulled this little stunt,

22:36.267 --> 22:38.705
and you can do some good
for a change.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.447
What do you mean, "good"?

22:44.275 --> 22:46.103
We need to get all this dung
out of here

22:46.147 --> 22:47.801
so we can set up a gift shop.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.585
We're going to be rich.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.848
-From now on,

22:51.892 --> 22:53.937
we work for the mugatos.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.505
This place has to be
a horned heaven!

22:58.333 --> 23:01.205
No, you only reveal
the graph at the end.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.164
Well, can you inflate
the numbers?

23:03.207 --> 23:04.818
Wait, are you being serious?

23:04.861 --> 23:06.123
I guess not.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.038
Sorry we thought you were
a secret super spy

23:08.082 --> 23:09.649
who was ready
to kill us, by the way.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.302
In retrospect, it probably
would have come up before.

23:11.346 --> 23:13.304
And I'm sorry I spread a rumor

23:13.348 --> 23:15.176
and made you feel like you
weren't my equals,

23:15.219 --> 23:17.134
because today
you were the badasses.

23:17.178 --> 23:18.614
I guess I kick ass one way,

23:18.658 --> 23:20.834
-and you guys do it another.
-Thanks, Mariner.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.705
So what is happening
in this game?

23:22.749 --> 23:23.837
Are we almost at a compromise?

23:23.880 --> 23:25.186
No, not even close.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.970
Do you even understand
how to play this at all?

23:27.014 --> 23:28.711
I-I guess I don't.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.234
I'm gonna go grab another round.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.498
How is she kicking
our asses so hard?

23:32.541 --> 23:34.630
I don't know, but we gotta
make sure she never finds out.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.981
-What can I get you, Mariner?
-Three of the same.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.983
Hey. You see those
two guys back there?

23:40.027 --> 23:41.985
Those are the Mugato Twins.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.248
Fought off a dozen mugatos
barehanded.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.076
Then they ground up
their mugato horns,

23:46.120 --> 23:48.514
snorted 'em,
and acquired strange powers.

23:48.557 --> 23:51.517
Whoa. Well,
your secret's safe with me.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.214
Honus! Are you kidding me?

23:53.257 --> 23:55.651
I needed those limes yesterday!

23:55.695 --> 23:58.045
For real, man, if you don't
want to work at the bar,

23:58.088 --> 24:00.090
don't work at the bar.

25:03.458 --> 25:03.719
Chirp.
