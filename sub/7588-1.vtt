03:09.081 --> 03:10.195
- New patient?
- Yes.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.000
I was referred by my lawyer
about veneers.

03:13.161 --> 03:14.914
You're a new patient. Fill this out...

03:15.082 --> 03:17.721
....so we know who to contact
in case we lose you in the chair.

03:19.804 --> 03:22.160
That was a joke, sweetie.
I was being funny.

03:25.325 --> 03:26.998
Hello.

03:27.166 --> 03:30.716
Mrs. Remar, I'm Dr. Johnson.

03:30.886 --> 03:32.366
Oh, it's Miss Remar.

03:32.527 --> 03:36.078
And I know who you are. I see another
doctor in the building regularly.

03:36.248 --> 03:38.205
I've been on the elevator
with you a few times.

03:38.369 --> 03:40.042
Oh, okay.

03:40.210 --> 03:43.169
You're married?
I never noticed the ring before.

03:43.331 --> 03:46.050
Oh, yes, I am. I'm married.

03:46.211 --> 03:48.773
All right, what are we doing
for you today?

03:49.692 --> 03:51.331
One veneer, is that right?

03:51.493 --> 03:53.883
They told me you don't
usually do just one.

03:54.055 --> 03:56.808
We do whatever's needed.
Allie.

03:57.855 --> 04:00.575
All right. Let's see.

04:01.137 --> 04:03.810
- Now, which one is it?
- I don't know.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.570
You tell me.

04:16.341 --> 04:19.015
So another cutie with a crush, huh?

04:19.821 --> 04:21.177
What is it with you?

04:25.103 --> 04:26.936
So you'll be back next week?

04:27.105 --> 04:30.017
You're gonna schedule Miss Remar
next week for the veneer. Right?

04:30.185 --> 04:32.381
Yeah. I'm gonna clear the
schedule the whole week...

04:32.546 --> 04:34.937
....so that you could be mentally
prepared for it. Okay?

04:35.547 --> 04:37.459
It was so nice to finally meet you.

04:37.628 --> 04:39.937
Oh, yeah. You too.

04:42.230 --> 04:43.982
Okay.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.742
I need the...

04:47.311 --> 04:49.542
Oh, it's my daughters.

04:49.712 --> 04:51.191
I'm gonna need that jacket.

04:54.514 --> 04:57.392
- Okay, you stay, and then I'll reach.
- Sorry.

04:57.554 --> 04:59.510
No, that's fine. I'm minutes away.

05:12.239 --> 05:13.797
Charlie...?

05:14.239 --> 05:16.708
Hey, Charlie! Charlie Fineman!

05:22.683 --> 05:24.320
Charlie!

05:30.685 --> 05:34.394
Charlie. Charlie Fineman.

06:02.535 --> 06:05.572
I'm so sick of your father.

06:05.735 --> 06:07.374
He's in that bed again.

06:07.536 --> 06:10.051
Just as mean and evil as he can be.

06:10.217 --> 06:12.685
Like a pig with a bullet in his head.

06:12.857 --> 06:15.054
You take your walk today, Mom?

06:17.379 --> 06:19.735
I'll take that as a no.

06:24.022 --> 06:25.613
Dad?

06:27.943 --> 06:31.015
I hate this city. I hate this damn city.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.572
I don't know why
you brought us here.

06:34.585 --> 06:37.305
I got the papaya juice you asked for.

06:39.386 --> 06:41.948
Hate this damn city.

06:42.668 --> 06:47.264
And the smell. All that garbage
all up and down the street.

06:47.428 --> 06:49.625
Daddy? I need money for the
dress for the dinner...

06:49.790 --> 06:51.348
....I'm going to with the Jacobsons.

06:51.510 --> 06:52.784
And you'll have to drive me...

06:52.950 --> 06:55.671
....because Mom's gonna be
at Cherie's chorus practise.

06:55.912 --> 06:57.231
Okay.

06:57.393 --> 06:59.189
We have to talk about
getting a cell phone.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.628
This morning, you said
we could talk about it tonight.

07:02.435 --> 07:04.789
I thought we talked about
the cell-phone issue.

07:04.954 --> 07:07.229
But I'm 13 and I still share
with my little sister.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.546
Oh, right. Because you only
need a cell phone...

07:09.716 --> 07:12.675
....if Mommy or Daddy's late...
- I ran into Charlie Fineman today.

07:14.036 --> 07:15.597
Really? How is he?

07:15.759 --> 07:20.274
I don't know. I was in the car
and he was on foot.

07:20.439 --> 07:23.353
He was coming out of a hardware
store. He was carrying paint.

07:23.521 --> 07:25.637
You think he's still practising?

07:27.600 --> 07:29.911
Who's Charlie Fineman, Daddy?

07:30.442 --> 07:33.081
He's an old college friend
of mine, baby.

07:33.243 --> 07:36.043
He was my college
roommate, actually.

07:36.525 --> 07:38.481
I haven't talked to him
in a long, long time.

07:38.805 --> 07:40.874
Is he the one from dental school...

07:41.045 --> 07:45.199
....whose family was on the plane?
Is that Charlie Fineman?

07:46.047 --> 07:47.560
Yeah.

07:47.727 --> 07:49.765
That's Charlie Fineman.

08:06.774 --> 08:10.734
You know, I decided to sign us up
for another photography class.

08:13.015 --> 08:15.895
You did?
You already signed us up?

08:16.057 --> 08:18.696
Yeah, but this time
for the advanced one.

08:18.857 --> 08:21.816
I thought we had fun last quarter,
didn't you?

08:22.900 --> 08:24.252
What, you don't want to?

08:24.419 --> 08:27.093
No, I do. Don't you?

08:27.260 --> 08:28.819
I loved it.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.574
- I had a really good time.
- Yeah.

08:30.742 --> 08:32.059
- Didn't you love it?
- I did.

08:32.222 --> 08:36.615
And now Advanced Photography?
I mean, wow. I'm... Yeah.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.183
Good.

08:39.743 --> 08:40.893
No sugar.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.341
Don't take that to school, okay?

08:43.506 --> 08:46.623
Whole Foods. Whole Foods snacks.

09:01.831 --> 09:03.902
- Hey, Angela.
- Dr. Johnson.

09:04.072 --> 09:06.870
What is it about us always leaving
the building at the same time?

09:07.032 --> 09:08.911
- It's quitting time.
- That's true.

09:09.074 --> 09:11.111
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

09:11.275 --> 09:13.994
Good. Let me ask you something.
Most married men have hobbies.

09:14.155 --> 09:15.747
Okay, Alan. Don't do this.
Come on.

09:15.916 --> 09:18.032
- Don't do what?
- We talked about this.

09:18.196 --> 09:21.587
It's not really fair for you
to wait for me out here on the street.

09:21.757 --> 09:24.671
If you wanna make an appointment,
we can make an appointment.

09:24.839 --> 09:26.636
Yeah, I know. But it's a little thing.

09:26.799 --> 09:28.995
Now, you remember the friend
I was asking you about?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.231
The friend who has no friends?
Other than you?

09:31.401 --> 09:33.516
Yeah, him. So he's
a married guy, right?

09:33.680 --> 09:35.912
And he's got a great wife
and the whole nine.

09:36.081 --> 09:40.873
But she will not let him...
I mean, it's like he can't just...

09:41.402 --> 09:42.962
I mean, guys have
guy hobbies, right?

09:43.125 --> 09:45.002
They play poker, they golf,
they do shit.

09:45.165 --> 09:47.474
Okay, you know what? Stop. Stop.

09:47.645 --> 09:49.682
I can't treat you from the lobby
to the car park.

09:49.847 --> 09:53.362
Treat me? I'm not...
I just asked you a question.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.037
- Well, whatever you wanna call it...
- No, you're right.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.279
- It's inappropriate.
- You're right. I get it.

09:58.449 --> 09:59.599
Let me ask you one thing.

09:59.770 --> 10:02.490
I want your opinion
as a woman, Angela.

10:02.651 --> 10:04.004
As a woman.

10:05.052 --> 10:08.044
Look, if I have
this recurring dream where...

10:08.212 --> 10:09.852
....I'm sitting on my couch...

10:10.014 --> 10:13.847
....and it turns into a big vat of rubber,
what is that?

10:15.014 --> 10:18.053
Why don't you let me
refer you to someone else?

10:21.975 --> 10:24.094
Okay. Well...

10:24.258 --> 10:26.772
....I hope it works out for you.

10:27.457 --> 10:30.258
You wait for me enough times
out on the street, though...

10:30.420 --> 10:33.059
....you might owe me
some dental work.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.612
Have a nice day.

10:52.306 --> 10:53.660
Bingo. There we go.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.865
- That was a tough one.
- Okay. Absolutely.

10:57.028 --> 11:00.338
Now it all will fall into place.

11:00.508 --> 11:03.307
Dad, can you take me
to Becky Fishman's?

11:03.469 --> 11:05.062
Sweetie, it's 9:30.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.062
She wants me to spend the night.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.983
Well, Daddy's had
a long day at work...

11:09.151 --> 11:11.462
....and he's finally finding some time
to enjoy himself.

11:11.633 --> 11:12.951
Just have her come over here.

11:13.112 --> 11:15.546
And we can study your
French together.

11:15.712 --> 11:17.785
Oh, you know what?
I'll take her. I'll go.

11:17.955 --> 11:20.628
Babe. We've come this far.
We've been working on this all week.

11:20.794 --> 11:24.107
I know. I'll go. I'll go, and then
I'll just come right back.

11:24.277 --> 11:26.996
Don't be mad if I have this
all done by the time you get back.

11:27.157 --> 11:28.351
Because I'm on a roll here.

11:28.517 --> 11:30.953
You're gonna miss out
on all the action.

11:31.119 --> 11:34.316
Just make sure you
save me some sky, okay?

11:34.479 --> 11:36.071
You know you owe
that child bigtime.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.709
You would've thought she got you
out of traffic school...

11:38.881 --> 11:40.519
....by the look on your face.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.921
Good night, babe.

11:46.203 --> 11:48.034
- Good night.
- Thanks.

11:51.165 --> 11:56.559
Hey, Charlie. Charlie.
Charlie Fineman, hey!

11:57.488 --> 11:59.603
Charlie, stop!

12:02.848 --> 12:05.318
- Hey, Charlie. Hey, man.
- Yeah?

12:05.490 --> 12:08.084
- It's Alan.
- Hey. How are you?

12:08.250 --> 12:11.483
I saw you coming out of a paint store
a couple weeks ago and...

12:11.652 --> 12:13.404
I was screaming for you,
honking the horn.

12:13.572 --> 12:15.881
I stopped the car, jumped out
in traffic. It was crazy.

12:16.052 --> 12:19.444
Then I tried to get in touch with you,
but nobody had any info on you.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.286
Oh, good, good. Very cool.

12:21.454 --> 12:24.254
- How you doing?
- So we know each other?

12:25.096 --> 12:26.973
Are you kidding me?

12:27.136 --> 12:29.775
It's Alan Johnson, Charlie.

12:30.656 --> 12:32.933
We went to dental school together.

12:33.098 --> 12:35.976
Burrows Hall. I was your college
roommate. You don't remember me?

12:36.138 --> 12:38.654
Yeah, very cool. Very cool.

12:38.820 --> 12:42.608
- Good. Good to see you, Burrows.
- It's Johnson.

12:43.542 --> 12:47.251
Charlie, you seriously
don't remember me?

12:48.102 --> 12:50.378
- We were college roommates?
- Yeah.

12:50.743 --> 12:53.417
Yeah, you slept naked most nights.

12:53.584 --> 12:56.896
And you were a sleepwalker.
It was the worst two years of my life.

12:57.906 --> 12:59.226
Hey, are you practising, man?

12:59.387 --> 13:01.901
I tried to get in touch
through the Dental Guild...

13:02.067 --> 13:04.424
I'm practising all the time,
up in the valley.

13:04.589 --> 13:06.864
Took down 12 of
the Colossus so far.

13:07.029 --> 13:10.466
The valley? What is that? Is that
a medical complex or something?

13:10.630 --> 13:13.270
It's more like another dimension.

13:13.750 --> 13:17.665
You take a journey
and discover yourself.

13:18.713 --> 13:21.784
- Hey, man, you wanna go get a drink?
- I can't drink. I can't drink.

13:21.952 --> 13:25.186
I can't drink. I can't drink.

13:25.355 --> 13:26.549
I gotta get going.

13:26.715 --> 13:29.513
Then a coffee or something.
Let's just go get a cup of coffee.

13:29.674 --> 13:34.626
Real quick. I would just love to
catch up with you, man.

13:38.999 --> 13:40.228
Hey, Charlie.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.994
This okay?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.357
You like trivia?

14:01.406 --> 14:03.044
Name the Great Lakes.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.728
The Great Lakes.
Can you name them?

14:10.769 --> 14:12.123
Okay, Michigan is one.

14:12.290 --> 14:15.168
Huron, Ontario, Michigan,
Erie and Superior.

14:15.329 --> 14:16.558
That was an easy one.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.244
That's fifth-grade shit.

14:24.333 --> 14:27.451
So, what have you
been up to lately, Charlie?

14:28.174 --> 14:32.488
I'm stuck between
Pale White and Moon White.

14:32.656 --> 14:35.409
I tried Butterscotch Yellow.

14:35.576 --> 14:37.454
I couldn't live with it.

14:37.617 --> 14:40.974
You painting something?
You're remodelling or?

14:42.538 --> 14:45.259
You were my college roommate.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.220
That was a long time ago.

14:55.303 --> 14:58.774
- A whole other life.
- Oh, yeah. No shit.

15:01.104 --> 15:03.698
It's good to see your face.

15:04.826 --> 15:06.418
Johnson.

15:07.387 --> 15:10.185
Yeah, it's good to
see you too, Charlie.

15:13.989 --> 15:16.105
Yeah. All right.

15:16.269 --> 15:18.705
You gotta take those shoes off.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.262
Thank you.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.663
Great record collection.

15:30.113 --> 15:31.627
Yeah.

15:31.794 --> 15:32.831
I'm happy with it.

15:32.996 --> 15:37.705
- A lot of vinyl.
- Yeah. Over 5500 so far.

15:37.876 --> 15:40.027
It's a work in progress.

15:43.198 --> 15:45.154
Kitchen remodel?

15:47.679 --> 15:48.669
What is this?

15:48.840 --> 15:51.070
"Shadows of the Colossus."

16:14.928 --> 16:17.203
Can I use your bathroom, Charlie?

16:18.329 --> 16:20.207
Oh, in the back.

16:47.058 --> 16:48.935
Nice music room.

17:17.267 --> 17:18.301
Good?

17:18.467 --> 17:19.617
Okay.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.858
There you go, Allie. Thank you.

17:30.551 --> 17:33.830
I'm sorry about the way I behaved
the last time I was here, doctor.

17:33.994 --> 17:36.905
But when I see you in the building,
you always seem very busy.

17:37.073 --> 17:38.713
Preoccupied.

17:38.875 --> 17:42.788
Even when you're with the
other doctors, you seem so solitary.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.906
So alone.

17:45.356 --> 17:48.554
I don't know why, but that seems
very familiar to me.

17:49.438 --> 17:51.109
Yeah.

17:51.277 --> 17:52.553
Well.

17:52.719 --> 17:55.109
I hope you're...

17:56.359 --> 17:59.592
I just thought that if you
wanted me to...

17:59.762 --> 18:01.433
....I would.

18:02.242 --> 18:04.312
With my mouth.

18:04.642 --> 18:06.156
I would.

18:07.884 --> 18:09.681
You could lock that door...

18:09.844 --> 18:11.754
....tell the nurse not to come in.

18:13.206 --> 18:14.878
I'd do it.

18:15.606 --> 18:17.995
I'd enjoy making you happy.

18:36.812 --> 18:38.484
You have to leave.

18:38.652 --> 18:43.809
I have this odd sense of intimacy
towards you. I don't even know why.

18:43.974 --> 18:46.092
I told my shrink, and she
said I should act on it.

18:46.256 --> 18:48.088
Oh, she did?
You need to get a new shrink.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.053
Get several.
And get a new dentist too.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.093
You gotta get out of here,
Miss Remar.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.375
I'm serious. I need you to leave
right now. Please. Go.

18:55.539 --> 18:57.131
Okay.

18:57.298 --> 18:58.812
Come on.

19:00.941 --> 19:02.613
Okay.

19:02.780 --> 19:04.737
The fuck...?

19:05.620 --> 19:08.581
I need you not to reschedule
Miss Remar for anything.

19:08.743 --> 19:10.335
Okay.

19:10.863 --> 19:12.296
Ever again. Nothing.

19:12.463 --> 19:13.454
Okay.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.456
I don't want this woman as a patient.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.980
- Got it. I got it.
- Fine. Thank you.

19:20.106 --> 19:21.540
Excuse me!

19:21.707 --> 19:23.379
Not right now. Hey.
Melanie, call her.

19:23.708 --> 19:26.906
- Miss Remar?
- On the phone, I mean. Don't...

19:28.589 --> 19:31.866
Miss Remar, you need
to find another dentist.

19:32.429 --> 19:33.499
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

19:33.671 --> 19:35.423
Dr. Johnson don't want you
as a patient...

19:35.591 --> 19:37.344
....neither do any
other doctors here...

19:37.512 --> 19:39.947
....so go somewhere, bury your face
in the phone book...

19:40.113 --> 19:42.787
....and find another dentist, all right?

19:50.276 --> 19:52.267
- "Bury your face in the phone book"?
- Yes.

19:52.876 --> 19:55.756
You have to be bold to make
these kind of people go away.

19:55.918 --> 19:57.874
Thanks for holding.

20:14.324 --> 20:15.359
Can I help you?

20:15.524 --> 20:18.482
I'm just going up to see a friend
of mine, Charlie Fineman.

20:19.524 --> 20:22.279
Nobody by that name
lives here. Sorry.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.838
That's fine. I'll just wait
for the landlord.

20:29.008 --> 20:30.601
That's me.

20:31.129 --> 20:34.281
Landlady.
Adell Modell, landlady from hell.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.089
Oh, well, I'm Alan Johnson.
I'm a friend of Charlie's.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.684
- Sure.
- We went to dental school together...

20:40.091 --> 20:43.324
I was in his apartment the other night.
We were playing...

20:43.493 --> 20:45.244
...."Shadows of the Colossus"
or something.

20:45.412 --> 20:49.090
You were up there in his apartment
the other night? That's a load of crap.

20:49.855 --> 20:51.766
He hasn't had anybody
up there in four years.

20:51.935 --> 20:54.132
Just me, Sugarman the accountant,
the cleaning girl.

20:54.297 --> 20:55.969
He doesn't know
about the cleaning girl.

20:56.137 --> 20:59.254
- I'm not lying to you. I was up there.
- Yeah.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.774
He's remodelling his kitchen.
Now, how would I know that?

21:01.939 --> 21:04.658
He's been remodelling that kitchen
once every couple of months.

21:04.819 --> 21:06.856
That tells me nothing. Go away.

21:07.741 --> 21:09.936
Johnson. Johnson!

21:10.141 --> 21:12.211
- Yo.
- Hey.

21:12.621 --> 21:14.534
Alan!

21:14.703 --> 21:16.740
Alan Johnson.

21:16.904 --> 21:18.621
This is my college roommate.

21:18.783 --> 21:20.934
It's my college roommate.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.460
I used to sleep in the nude.

21:25.905 --> 21:26.976
Check this out.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.221
I got a...
You'll appreciate this.

21:31.387 --> 21:36.304
The Pretenders. It's one of the
great debut albums of all time.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.460
Yeah, that's you.
Terrible taste in music.

21:38.709 --> 21:41.509
No, no, not true. Not true.

21:42.752 --> 21:44.708
Smell these things.

21:45.112 --> 21:48.231
I love the way they smell.
Take a whiff.

21:49.393 --> 21:52.032
Brings back a feeling.
Smells like the late '70s, don't it?

21:52.193 --> 21:56.189
- The early '80s. Yeah.
- Charlie!

21:56.356 --> 21:57.584
Charlie!

21:58.196 --> 22:00.152
It's okay, Charlie.
I'll take care of them.

22:00.316 --> 22:02.274
- Who's that?
- Charlie, we just wanna talk.

22:02.438 --> 22:05.316
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- What?

22:05.478 --> 22:06.467
Why? Who is that?

22:06.638 --> 22:08.756
Johnson, hop on.
Hop on, Johnson.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.593
- Hop on?
- Get on. Get on. Johnson.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.637
- Who is that?
- Johnson, damn it, get on.

22:12.800 --> 22:15.556
- Just get on the back.
- Wait a minute!

22:17.802 --> 22:20.077
Charlie! Charlie! Bus, Charlie!

22:20.242 --> 22:22.439
Oh, shit! Charlie.

22:22.604 --> 22:25.721
I know, I know. All right.

23:00.815 --> 23:03.377
You're late. They're pissed.

23:03.777 --> 23:07.486
Name the one national
U.S. Monument that's movable.

23:07.658 --> 23:10.890
Suck my ass, retard.
You're late. Get in there.

23:11.059 --> 23:13.448
No. San Francisco cable cars.

23:13.619 --> 23:16.772
Good. I didn't know that one either.
That's a good one.

23:16.941 --> 23:19.136
That's a great one if you ever
wanna stump somebody.

23:41.469 --> 23:44.189
If you guys could not laugh
at anything I say, that'd really...

23:44.350 --> 23:47.739
I'm trying to get my self-esteem
to go to, like, seven percent.

23:50.472 --> 23:52.463
Could I get another Heineken?

23:52.632 --> 23:55.193
- You want another root beer?
- I got enough. Thanks.

23:55.353 --> 23:56.833
Thanks.

23:59.034 --> 24:01.104
Hey, it was fun watching you
up there tonight, man.

24:01.475 --> 24:03.354
It was good music.

24:03.516 --> 24:04.915
I don't know if I'd go that far.

24:05.076 --> 24:07.874
But you know what it reminded me of?
It reminded me of school.

24:08.037 --> 24:11.395
When you used to jam to that
Bruce Springsteen album.

24:11.558 --> 24:14.027
- What was the name of that album?
- Bruce Springsteen...

24:14.198 --> 24:17.112
Yeah. What was that? The River.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.033
- The River?
- The River. You remember that?

24:19.201 --> 24:22.433
I was always trying to get you to play
The O'Jays or Earth, Wind & Fire...

24:22.602 --> 24:25.321
....but you always wanted to
jam to The River.

24:25.482 --> 24:27.075
I don't remember jamming to it.

24:27.243 --> 24:29.759
Maybe if you smelled it,
it'd all come rushing back.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.076
- This was fun, man.
- Oh, yeah.

24:35.246 --> 24:36.680
I had a good day today.

24:36.847 --> 24:38.916
Riding around on that silly scooter.
It was...

24:39.127 --> 24:40.845
It was my first time doubles.

24:41.006 --> 24:42.920
- It was fun. It was fun.
- Yeah.

24:43.089 --> 24:45.239
I don't do anything like that.

24:50.651 --> 24:52.607
Lot of girls here, Charlie.

24:52.771 --> 24:55.161
That's gotta be half
of the appeal, right?

24:58.453 --> 25:00.011
Why'd you ask me that?

25:02.855 --> 25:03.970
I don't know.

25:04.135 --> 25:06.933
I don't know. I'm just making
small talk, you know?

25:09.137 --> 25:10.968
You're single now.
You can do whatever you...

25:11.137 --> 25:13.571
- What?
- After what happened...

25:13.737 --> 25:16.856
....with your family and everything...
- Whoa, hey, I don't have a family.

25:17.019 --> 25:21.810
No. No, I know. I was just trying to
make small talk, but that was stupid.

25:22.942 --> 25:24.135
Who sent you here?

25:24.941 --> 25:27.171
- Did they send you here?
- What are you talking about?

25:27.341 --> 25:29.652
- Are you a specialist?
- A sp...? No, I'm not...

25:29.823 --> 25:31.735
- What are you talking about?
- Don't lie to me!

25:31.904 --> 25:34.464
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me.

25:34.624 --> 25:36.537
- Charlie, calm down.
- Why are you here?

25:36.706 --> 25:38.298
Why? Why?

25:39.106 --> 25:41.495
- Answer my fucking question.
- Charlie, you're screaming.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.659
Why are you here right now
talking to me?

25:43.828 --> 25:45.944
- Relax. Okay?
- Why? Why?

25:46.108 --> 25:47.905
Shit!

25:49.029 --> 25:53.023
- The fuck is wrong with you?
- Why are you talking to me?

25:57.632 --> 26:00.385
Oh, now I'm boring you?
Mr. Heckler?

26:00.552 --> 26:03.193
I'm bored too. I'm sorry
if I'm boring you. I'm sorry.

26:05.394 --> 26:07.908
You tell them to leave me alone!

26:47.767 --> 26:49.326
Alan.

26:49.688 --> 26:52.408
When you get a minute,
we need to see you.

26:54.609 --> 26:58.160
Alan, this is bad. The woman sent us
a letter, threatened to file a lawsuit.

26:58.331 --> 27:01.687
She claims that you sexually assaulted
her in the office on several occasions.

27:01.851 --> 27:04.447
That is ridiculous, all right?
That's absurd.

27:04.613 --> 27:06.444
Well, we checked with Melanie.

27:06.613 --> 27:09.208
Donna Remar.
What do you know about her?

27:09.374 --> 27:11.935
This woman is insane. Okay?

27:12.095 --> 27:14.325
She came in,
I put a single veneer on her...

27:14.495 --> 27:16.852
....she tells me
she's got this obsession...

27:17.017 --> 27:18.006
Excuse me, Marie.

27:18.178 --> 27:21.454
She said she wants to
give me oral sex in the office.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.290
You know what,
you need to make this go away.

27:25.459 --> 27:27.689
We can't handle a hit like this
on our insurance.

27:27.859 --> 27:29.692
Even if we win,
we're gonna get killed.

27:29.861 --> 27:31.773
How do I do that?
How do I make this go away?

27:31.942 --> 27:36.221
I don't know how you make it go away.
You see her again, you discuss it...

27:36.383 --> 27:39.774
Damn. I mean, isn't this exactly
like what it was the last time?

27:39.944 --> 27:41.855
Woman falls for you,
you lead them along...

27:42.024 --> 27:45.541
- You know what, John?
- No. No.

27:47.226 --> 27:49.103
What, Johnson?

27:53.908 --> 27:55.785
I'll get into it.

28:06.832 --> 28:10.224
Dr. Johnson?
I need to speak with you.

28:11.594 --> 28:13.074
I'm Ginger Timpleman...

28:13.354 --> 28:16.347
....and I'm Charlie Fineman's
mother-in-law.

28:20.677 --> 28:23.954
- Did you know Charlie's family?
- No.

28:24.118 --> 28:26.871
His parents died
when he was in grade school.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.316
He lived with an aunt before college.
I met her a couple of times.

28:30.481 --> 28:33.120
She passed
just before the wedding.

28:34.161 --> 28:36.995
You know, my wife and I,
we tried to call him so many times.

28:37.163 --> 28:40.872
Hadn't seen him in years, and I read
about what happened in the paper...

28:41.043 --> 28:44.879
....and I was just... I was just
heartbroken for him, you know?

28:45.045 --> 28:46.239
For them.

28:46.405 --> 28:48.077
He just, you know, shut down.

28:48.245 --> 28:51.603
Quit work. He stopped
wanting to talk about her.

28:51.767 --> 28:53.883
Then he acted like
he didn't remember them.

28:54.367 --> 28:56.006
Then he pretended
he didn't remember us.

28:56.167 --> 28:57.157
Yeah.

28:57.329 --> 28:59.240
All my husband and I
wanna do is see him.

28:59.409 --> 29:03.163
And that crazy landlady and his
business manager, Sugarman...

29:03.331 --> 29:05.561
....both conspire to keep us away.

29:05.731 --> 29:08.644
- Sugarman?
- Yeah, I don't care for him.

29:09.532 --> 29:12.843
Who knows what that little shyster's
taking from Charlie.

29:13.013 --> 29:15.447
- What is there to take?
- Between the government payout...

29:15.613 --> 29:18.652
....the insurance policy, Charlie
has enough to take care of himself...

29:18.816 --> 29:20.612
....put it that way.

29:26.257 --> 29:30.696
My husband retired young.
He was a cop.

29:32.380 --> 29:35.338
You know, we were young.
Young to be grandparents.

29:36.340 --> 29:39.459
I was gonna do nothing but travel...

29:39.782 --> 29:42.296
....and spoil my granddaughters.

29:43.863 --> 29:47.823
Then those monsters flew over here
from across the world...

29:48.224 --> 29:51.024
....and rearranged my dance card.

29:52.227 --> 29:55.457
- Sorry.
- Of course you are.

29:56.666 --> 29:58.784
But he needs help.

29:58.948 --> 30:03.022
Not the kind that landlady and
some little accountant can give him.

30:03.189 --> 30:04.943
He needs a therapist.

30:05.111 --> 30:06.941
And he needs family.

30:07.110 --> 30:10.946
Guess what. Jonathan and I
are the only family Charlie's got.

30:16.832 --> 30:21.192
Hey. Hey. Somebody's at the door.
Somebody's at the door.

30:21.355 --> 30:23.073
Cherie. Cherie.

30:23.235 --> 30:25.910
- Get away from the door.
- What are you doing?

30:26.077 --> 30:29.274
You don't go to the door in the
middle of the night. You know that.

30:29.437 --> 30:31.430
I think it's Charlie Fineman.

30:31.599 --> 30:32.872
Is that Charlie?

30:33.439 --> 30:36.272
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- Okay.

30:36.679 --> 30:38.717
So let him in.

30:43.601 --> 30:45.036
Yeah?

30:45.203 --> 30:48.594
Were you in bed already?
What's going on? It's 10:30.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.481
I'm always in bed at 10:30.

30:50.643 --> 30:54.763
- That sucks. That's grim.
- You don't have any root beer on you...

30:54.925 --> 30:56.325
....do you?
- No, why?

30:56.486 --> 30:57.919
Alan.

31:00.287 --> 31:02.676
Charlie, this is my wife, Janeane.

31:02.847 --> 31:05.886
Hi, I believe we met
about 15 years ago in Central Park.

31:06.049 --> 31:09.281
- I don't expect you to remember it.
- I don't.

31:09.930 --> 31:11.524
Okay.

31:12.052 --> 31:14.407
This is our daughter Cherie.

31:14.892 --> 31:17.612
Nice to meet you, Dr. Fineman.

31:18.693 --> 31:20.571
Go to bed, sweetheart.

31:22.254 --> 31:23.528
What's going on, Charlie?

31:23.694 --> 31:26.256
You wanna go out, man?
Go have some fun? Let's hang out.

31:27.096 --> 31:29.404
- Right now?
- Yeah, wake up. Come on. Let's...

31:29.576 --> 31:32.490
- Can he go out? Is he allowed out?
- Charlie, don't do that.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.728
Don't ask my wife permission
for me to go out.

31:34.898 --> 31:37.128
I'm right here in front of you.
I'm not 7 years old.

31:37.298 --> 31:39.815
You're right. Can you go out?

31:47.382 --> 31:51.501
She's threatening to sue you?
What does she want?

31:51.663 --> 31:54.053
She wants to go down on me.

31:56.824 --> 32:00.342
- Well, you tell her you can't do that.
- No, I know.

32:00.507 --> 32:02.417
- You tell her you're married?
- She knows.

32:02.586 --> 32:04.578
It's not a deterrent for this one.

32:04.747 --> 32:07.387
I mean, she's got some kind of
a fixation or something.

32:07.548 --> 32:10.221
Oh, well, fix it for her.

32:10.629 --> 32:11.665
It's not funny, Charlie.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.743
- No, no, no.
- It's really not funny, I mean...

32:15.070 --> 32:16.902
- My partners are up my ass.
- Right.

32:17.071 --> 32:19.541
We already pay an obscene amount
in liability insurance.

32:19.713 --> 32:22.909
You should tell your partners they can
do to you what the girl wants to do.

32:23.072 --> 32:24.712
Fuck them.

32:25.355 --> 32:26.344
I don't know.

32:26.515 --> 32:29.552
It's a five-year lease,
50 grand a month...

32:29.715 --> 32:32.356
....my name on it.
My partners get pissed off...

32:32.517 --> 32:34.951
....and they leave me holding the bag,
that's it, I'm done.

32:35.117 --> 32:37.347
- Yeah.
- I put the whole thing together.

32:37.517 --> 32:40.272
They act like I'm the one
who works for them.

32:41.719 --> 32:43.710
But the girl, what are you
gonna do about that?

32:43.880 --> 32:46.794
That's weird, you know?
It's kind of heavy.

32:46.962 --> 32:50.351
Yeah, it is. I'm telling you,
this girl's seriously troubled.

32:50.521 --> 32:53.993
Oh, yeah. She got a lot of problems
if she wants to blow you.

32:54.164 --> 32:57.236
She's out of her mind.
I've seen that thing.

32:57.644 --> 32:59.238
- That's very funny.
- No, no, no.

32:59.406 --> 33:01.316
No, it is... Are you having fun?

33:01.485 --> 33:04.158
To tell you the truth,
I kind of am, Johnson.

33:04.325 --> 33:06.363
It's nice to see you
in the soup like this.

33:06.527 --> 33:08.597
It's funny. Just not used to it.

33:08.767 --> 33:11.965
- Here. Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

33:12.129 --> 33:14.040
Any chance of you
getting audited this week?

33:14.209 --> 33:16.201
Because that would make things
even better.

33:16.370 --> 33:17.962
Or maybe
we could go somewhere...

33:18.130 --> 33:20.965
....and you could burn your tongue
on some pizza. I'd like that too.

33:21.132 --> 33:22.804
I would love that.

33:31.054 --> 33:32.808
I need you to hold for one moment.

33:32.976 --> 33:35.252
You are not gonna believe
who this is on the phone.

33:35.416 --> 33:37.806
- Who?
- The nut.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.337
At this point in my life,
you're gonna have to be very specific.

33:41.498 --> 33:43.568
Donna Remar.

33:43.738 --> 33:47.733
She wants to come in for another
consultation for some more veneers.

33:47.900 --> 33:51.018
Can you believe that? Ma'am?

33:51.181 --> 33:53.743
- Ma'am?
- Schedule it.

33:54.502 --> 33:59.055
- Excuse me?
- Schedule it in my office alone.

33:59.224 --> 34:01.102
- Morning, Oscar.
- Hey, doc.

34:01.265 --> 34:02.936
Good to see you.

34:05.665 --> 34:07.736
- Hello, Dr. Johnson.
- Hello.

34:07.906 --> 34:09.737
- I've got a question.
- I'm sure you do.

34:09.907 --> 34:12.024
- No, it's not about me this time.
- How refreshing.

34:12.188 --> 34:16.784
It's about a friend. Really, though.
I mean, really, a real friend.

34:18.547 --> 34:22.829
He lost his whole family
in a plane crash.

34:22.991 --> 34:24.264
- Right.
- It's horrible.

34:24.431 --> 34:26.663
I mean, his wife,
his three daughters.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.312
This guy used to be a dentist.

34:28.473 --> 34:30.748
- How long ago?
- It's a few years ago...

34:30.913 --> 34:34.351
....and he's lost now.
You know? He's completely lost.

34:34.514 --> 34:37.348
I bumped into him. We used to be
college roommates for two years.

34:37.514 --> 34:40.235
- He didn't even remember me.
- Well, offhand, that sounds like...

34:40.397 --> 34:43.786
....post-traumatic stress disorder.
Maybe worse.

34:43.956 --> 34:47.668
I couldn't really know without seeing
him. It sounds like he needs help.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.637
- Is he getting help?
- I don't know.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.755
I mean, the whole thing is...

34:51.918 --> 34:54.594
It's really odd, you know?
It's crazy odd.

34:55.482 --> 34:56.914
How are you?

34:57.322 --> 34:59.597
I'm fine.
I got nothing to complain about.

34:59.763 --> 35:01.993
Does that mean you're fine?

35:02.163 --> 35:06.204
Very good. You are gonna
be sending me a bill one day.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.880
You might wanna check
your mailbox.

35:09.286 --> 35:12.643
- Okay.
- Dr. Johnson, I think it would be...

35:12.807 --> 35:14.560
....really good for you
to talk to someone.

35:15.608 --> 35:17.643
I just sense that it would be...

35:17.808 --> 35:20.243
....good for you to be
a little bit more communicative.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.765
I hope that didn't offend you.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.846
Okay. Well, I'll see you soon?

35:27.012 --> 35:28.002
Okay.

35:40.937 --> 35:43.497
- Charlie.
- In the back!

35:46.819 --> 35:50.970
- Hope the shoes are off.
- Shoes are off. Shoes are off.

35:53.620 --> 35:57.660
Hey, the kitchen's looking good, man.
You almost done?

36:02.183 --> 36:03.695
Is that The River?

36:03.862 --> 36:05.660
Yeah.

36:06.263 --> 36:09.063
You know, I gotta get you enrolled
in a music-appreciation class.

36:09.225 --> 36:12.103
Oh, right, yeah.
Tell that to Clarence Clemons.

36:12.265 --> 36:14.337
What's going on?
What's going on with the girl?

36:14.507 --> 36:17.146
The crazy girl, the one who wants
your penis. How's she doing?

36:17.307 --> 36:20.267
- Let's not talk about her.
- Yeah, you wanna...? Lose that tie.

36:20.429 --> 36:22.863
Lose the tie and the scarf.
The whole outfit.

36:23.029 --> 36:24.747
- For what?
- Come on, take it off.

36:24.909 --> 36:27.425
Psychedelic time. Psychedelic time.

36:27.591 --> 36:29.548
I smell a Fineman jam session
coming on.

36:29.712 --> 36:33.387
Yeah, Burrows Hall-style.
Burrows Hall.

36:33.552 --> 36:35.623
Jamming and jamming
and jamming.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.068
- Here.
- I don't play guitar, Charlie.

36:38.233 --> 36:39.827
Hey, Johnson,
you're barely a dentist.

36:39.995 --> 36:42.350
You pull people's teeth all day.
It don't matter.

36:42.516 --> 36:46.475
Come on. Come on. All right.
Get that in you. Get that in you.

36:46.636 --> 36:49.276
- Let me do this.
- You'll get to this. Come on.

36:49.437 --> 36:50.791
Let me hear some of that.

36:57.519 --> 36:58.794
I don't know how to play this.

37:15.766 --> 37:17.245
Charlie Fineman!

37:17.406 --> 37:21.526
- Alan Johnson. Alan Johnson!
- Charlie Fineman!

37:21.688 --> 37:23.360
Good night, Jersey!

37:23.529 --> 37:26.123
- Philadelphia. Philadelphia!
- Good night, Philly!

37:29.530 --> 37:33.079
Baby, I'm sorry. I messed up, but you
know I don't ever do anything like that.

37:33.250 --> 37:35.322
I just didn't wanna call you
and wake you up.

37:35.492 --> 37:37.847
I was stuck in Charlie world.
I couldn't...

37:39.453 --> 37:40.602
....leave.

37:41.334 --> 37:43.484
This is not okay.

37:43.654 --> 37:45.770
You staying out all night...

37:45.934 --> 37:47.164
....it's not acceptable.

37:49.937 --> 37:53.088
I'm just saying,
the guy's in a lot of pain.

37:55.699 --> 37:58.338
It's sad over there, baby. It's just...

37:59.138 --> 38:01.449
Just a sea of sadness.

38:04.861 --> 38:08.776
- Yeah.
- Hi. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson.

38:09.143 --> 38:11.896
- You don't have an appointment, sir?
- Oh, we're friends.

38:12.423 --> 38:14.381
- What...?
- We were college roommates.

38:14.545 --> 38:17.218
- And?
- I used to sleep in the nude.

38:22.787 --> 38:25.585
- Charlie?
- All right, come in.

38:25.747 --> 38:28.388
I hear "Colossus."

38:28.549 --> 38:29.538
Hey.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.820
Hey, hey, buddy.
Take the shoes off. I told you.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.386
I told you.

38:42.873 --> 38:44.784
Hey, didn't you just?

38:48.956 --> 38:51.516
All right. All right.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.310
Hey, let me try it.

38:57.478 --> 38:58.957
Hang on.

38:59.118 --> 39:01.395
- Let me try it.
- Just watch me do it first.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.676
Let me just try it.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.800
- Okay, how do you shoot it?
- Square is to stab him.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.874
That's the bird. You wanna
shoot him, get his attention.

39:10.042 --> 39:12.476
All right.
All right, get your arrow ready.

39:12.642 --> 39:16.000
And let me pluck him
right in the uterus.

39:18.124 --> 39:19.443
Aim what?

39:19.604 --> 39:21.197
Oh, fuck.

39:21.447 --> 39:23.676
I could show you how to do it,
give you some hints...

39:23.846 --> 39:25.598
....but I'll warn you,
it's very addictive.

39:25.766 --> 39:27.997
Well, I don't have
an addictive personality...

39:28.168 --> 39:30.728
....so just show me how to do it.

39:32.688 --> 39:34.328
Is something I said funny?

39:34.490 --> 39:35.923
All right.

39:36.090 --> 39:38.684
That'll call your horse.
The triangle is how you jump...

39:38.850 --> 39:40.330
Okay, okay, very good.

39:40.491 --> 39:42.563
- Stab his arm.
- I'm stabbing him in the arm.

39:42.733 --> 39:45.691
- No, you gotta stab in the right spot.
- I'm stabbing it right there.

39:45.853 --> 39:46.967
You gotta be on the light.

39:47.133 --> 39:48.363
- Shit.
- That's not gonna work.

39:48.535 --> 39:50.730
I gotta climb this big son of a bitch...

39:50.895 --> 39:52.886
Look, just put it down, all right?
Rest.

39:53.055 --> 39:55.332
Next time you come, you'll be better.
Let it soak in.

39:55.497 --> 39:58.967
No, no, no. Right now.
No next. Now.

39:59.137 --> 40:01.606
I thought you don't have
an addictive personality.

40:01.779 --> 40:03.974
That was the line of the night, man.

40:04.139 --> 40:05.128
You're an addict.

40:05.299 --> 40:09.772
- Say it, man. Say you're an addict.
- Yeah, okay. I'm an addict. All right.

40:13.901 --> 40:16.656
- Come on, now, stab his wing.
- Oh, God.

40:16.823 --> 40:20.020
- Oh, I'm on your ass, bird.
- Stab his wing. All right. Yeah.

40:21.103 --> 40:23.540
Colossus!

40:42.471 --> 40:44.508
That's the first three...

40:44.672 --> 40:46.981
Okay, now, wait.
You said they get bigger too?

40:47.152 --> 40:48.632
Well, no, it's different.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.829
It's like you're gonna use
a bow and arrow more.

40:50.993 --> 40:54.111
- Each one will have different powers.
- What are we doing?

40:54.915 --> 40:57.988
Wait a minute, Charlie,
you said get a burger, man. I can't...

40:58.156 --> 41:01.306
I can't do this.
I gotta work in the morning.

41:01.477 --> 41:03.628
Yeah, so you'll work,
you'll be tired. So what?

41:03.917 --> 41:07.627
This is like a marathon, man.
It'll go till 5 in the morning. I can't...

41:07.798 --> 41:11.076
You'll go to sleep tomorrow night
at 8:00 instead of 10:30.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.800
How's that?
Is that enough sleep, you faggot?

41:13.960 --> 41:15.793
Hey, don't call me faggot.

41:15.962 --> 41:17.873
- Are you a faggot?
- Quit saying faggot.

41:18.042 --> 41:20.158
Just don't say faggot.

41:20.322 --> 41:22.236
Don't just call people faggot.
That's rude.

41:22.405 --> 41:25.953
To a gay guy it is.
To you, it's just...

41:26.684 --> 41:31.237
....a funny word,
like pound cake or pickle.

41:33.646 --> 41:35.400
You're a fucked-up dude, man.

41:35.568 --> 41:37.240
I'm a fucked-up dude? Okay.

41:37.409 --> 41:39.364
You really need some Mel.

41:39.528 --> 41:41.201
You need some Mel.

41:41.369 --> 41:43.043
I'll take one adult and one faggot.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.530
Come on, you really need
to come in here.

41:49.052 --> 41:50.691
Johnson.

41:51.093 --> 41:52.650
- Johnson.
- Okay.

41:52.813 --> 41:54.724
Good decision.

41:59.775 --> 42:03.406
Hey! The sheriff is a nig...

42:03.817 --> 42:06.536
- What did he say?
- The sheriff is near.

42:06.817 --> 42:08.011
No.

42:09.219 --> 42:11.050
The sheriff is a nig...

42:16.741 --> 42:20.859
I ain't got no body

42:21.022 --> 42:23.697
And nobody cares for me

42:28.143 --> 42:29.704
He's out of his mind.

42:31.226 --> 42:34.423
- Richard Pryor, he did his own thing.
- They both did great, obviously...

42:34.586 --> 42:38.466
....but I can only imagine,
if they would have done another one?

42:39.188 --> 42:41.827
Janeane's called 15 times.

42:44.830 --> 42:45.978
- Hello?
- Hey, baby.

42:46.149 --> 42:49.348
Where have you been? I've been
calling you for the last three hours.

42:49.512 --> 42:53.630
I know. I'm sorry. I had the phone off.
I was in this Mel Brooks marathon.

42:53.792 --> 42:56.148
I've never laughed so hard.
I gotta bring you down here.

42:56.314 --> 43:00.068
- This thing is crazy.
- Alan, I need you to listen to me.

43:02.154 --> 43:04.226
Your father's died.

43:04.396 --> 43:06.273
- What?
- And I've been trying to reach you...

43:06.436 --> 43:08.586
- What did you just say?
- Your mother called here...

43:08.756 --> 43:10.316
....a couple hours after you left.

43:10.958 --> 43:12.869
He died in his sleep, in his bed...

43:13.038 --> 43:16.476
....and Mom's here with us now and
she's very upset and she needs you.

43:16.840 --> 43:19.877
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
He's dead?

43:22.602 --> 43:24.752
I'm sorry, baby.

43:26.842 --> 43:29.152
- Where are the girls?
- They're with Mom on the couch.

43:29.323 --> 43:30.963
They're fine.

43:32.044 --> 43:35.834
- I'll be home as soon as I can.
- Will you please hurry up?

43:36.006 --> 43:37.963
Yeah, I will.

43:47.928 --> 43:49.157
Everything cool?

43:54.931 --> 43:56.969
My dad just died.

43:58.173 --> 43:59.891
Died, like...

44:00.053 --> 44:02.647
....dead?
- Yeah.

44:04.495 --> 44:06.486
You wanna go get some breakfast?

44:08.255 --> 44:10.452
Charlie, my father just died.

44:12.737 --> 44:15.615
Yeah. There's a store
that's gonna open up soon.

44:15.777 --> 44:17.735
Sells kitchen counters.
I wanna take you there.

44:17.899 --> 44:20.208
- They got marble tops.
- Charlie, my father just died.

44:20.379 --> 44:23.133
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I wanna hang, though.

44:23.300 --> 44:26.338
Come on.
Let's not waste all this Mel.

44:26.501 --> 44:28.696
We just got a good dose of Mel.

44:31.463 --> 44:32.738
Are we hanging?

44:34.544 --> 44:36.101
No.

44:37.706 --> 44:39.583
We're not hanging.

44:50.630 --> 44:55.704
Oh, hey, let's get some Chinese.
Come on, don't be such a pussy.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.600
All right, does everybody
see what it is?

45:35.362 --> 45:39.153
Here it is. At the bottom.
See? Good look.

45:39.325 --> 45:42.044
Come on. What do you think?

46:01.091 --> 46:02.524
- Yeah.
- Johnson?

46:02.691 --> 46:04.446
- Yep.
- I'm Sugarman.

46:04.614 --> 46:07.650
Bryan Sugarman?
Did I catch you at a bad time?

46:07.813 --> 46:10.852
Well, I just came back from burying
my father, but other than that...

46:11.015 --> 46:13.688
Cool.
Let me just say up front, Alan...

46:13.855 --> 46:16.244
....I make it my business
to watch this guy's back.

46:16.415 --> 46:18.772
- That's what I do. I look out for him.
- Okay.

46:18.937 --> 46:21.087
Now, obviously,
I can't stop him from doing this...

46:21.257 --> 46:23.897
....without going down
a very dangerous legal road.

46:24.058 --> 46:26.254
But rest assured,
I'll do anything short of that...

46:26.419 --> 46:28.092
....to not give you a million dollars.

46:29.339 --> 46:31.219
I don't know
what you're talking about.

46:31.501 --> 46:33.572
He wants me to give you
a million dollars.

46:33.742 --> 46:34.776
He has that kind of money?

46:34.942 --> 46:37.742
That's none of your business.
That's my business. It's what I do.

46:37.904 --> 46:40.941
We've already established that.
I won't let him be manipulated.

46:41.104 --> 46:43.174
Sugarman, calm down, okay?

46:43.344 --> 46:45.985
I don't want his million dollars.

46:46.146 --> 46:49.900
Tell him I'm not mad at him and we're
still friends, okay? Just tell him that.

46:50.547 --> 46:51.776
- You're being straight?
- Yes.

46:51.948 --> 46:55.179
I don't need his million dollars, okay?
Just tell him that.

46:55.349 --> 46:56.940
Okay. I like that.

46:57.108 --> 46:59.305
Okay, good, then I've done my job.

47:00.511 --> 47:03.024
Yeah. Good job.

47:03.671 --> 47:05.583
Come on in and have some food.

47:06.752 --> 47:08.311
Go ahead.

47:10.392 --> 47:11.986
Daddy, your friend is here.

47:13.194 --> 47:16.107
The one who acts
like he's younger than JoJo.

47:16.275 --> 47:18.187
Charlie Fineman?

47:18.957 --> 47:20.947
Honey, don't be like that, okay?

47:21.117 --> 47:23.505
Don't judge people.
That's not polite.

47:30.079 --> 47:31.434
Hey.

47:31.601 --> 47:33.990
I'm sorry about your dad.

47:34.161 --> 47:35.435
Thanks.

47:35.601 --> 47:38.993
I behaved badly that night.
I know I did.

47:39.163 --> 47:40.801
All right? I'm sorry.

47:42.163 --> 47:45.840
And you wanted to give me
a million dollars to make up for it?

47:49.605 --> 47:53.520
I don't have any friends
other than you, Johnson.

47:57.288 --> 47:58.404
I got you something.

48:04.330 --> 48:06.891
- The River.
- Absolutely.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.484
- And Quadrophenia.
- Yeah.

48:08.651 --> 48:10.483
Another album you
used to torture me with.

48:10.652 --> 48:13.850
Quadrophenia changed
my life, Johnson.

48:14.013 --> 48:15.367
That's a nice gift.

48:15.974 --> 48:17.453
Too late to go for the million?

48:20.296 --> 48:22.172
- Hey, are you hungry?
- Yeah.

48:22.335 --> 48:24.054
- Wanna get some breakfast?
- Yeah.

48:24.216 --> 48:27.095
- Come on.
- All right.

48:28.738 --> 48:31.047
Just me and you here?

48:31.820 --> 48:34.095
Hey, everybody...

48:34.260 --> 48:36.979
....this is Charlie. Charlie...

48:37.140 --> 48:38.860
....this is everybody. Come on in.

48:41.022 --> 48:42.899
These guys are staying?

48:44.743 --> 48:48.498
Yeah, Charlie. Everybody's staying.

49:18.433 --> 49:21.871
Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson.
We're having lunch today.

49:22.035 --> 49:24.025
We're having Chinese.

49:24.715 --> 49:27.675
I can't tell you how happy
that makes me.

49:42.361 --> 49:45.399
The last time you were
in a dental office, anyway?

49:47.723 --> 49:49.840
Need to schedule you
for a cleaning?

49:50.004 --> 49:52.314
Come on.
Let's go get something to eat.

49:59.487 --> 50:01.159
You miss it?

50:01.447 --> 50:03.200
Miss what?

50:04.647 --> 50:06.765
- Nothing. Forget it.
- What? What? Come on.

50:06.929 --> 50:08.602
Charlie, nothing, all right? Forget it.

50:08.770 --> 50:11.967
No, what do you think I missed,
being a dentist?

50:12.130 --> 50:13.247
Do you?

50:13.412 --> 50:14.844
Why?

50:15.011 --> 50:17.650
- Why what?
- Why are you asking me?

50:17.811 --> 50:19.725
Are you trying to focus me?

50:19.893 --> 50:23.523
Is that it?
Did they send you here to focus me?

50:23.694 --> 50:27.530
Yeah, you got me.
That's it. I'm with the CIA...

50:27.696 --> 50:29.607
....and this is
Operation Focus Fineman.

50:29.776 --> 50:31.289
- Are you kidding me?
- Better not be.

50:31.456 --> 50:34.768
Charlie, if we're gonna be friends,
you have to be able to trust me.

50:34.938 --> 50:37.327
- Thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

50:37.498 --> 50:40.094
That's why I can't pretend
I don't know anything about you.

50:40.260 --> 50:42.728
Is that a threat, though,
to not be friends?

50:42.900 --> 50:46.452
No. I'm saying friends talk about
what's going on in their lives.

50:46.622 --> 50:48.340
You're an asshole.

50:48.502 --> 50:50.777
Charlie... Hey, Charlie!

50:50.942 --> 50:53.299
What the fuck is wrong with you?

50:53.464 --> 50:54.817
Get out of here, man!

50:54.984 --> 50:55.973
Charlie, get the f...

50:56.985 --> 50:59.706
Okay, okay. Get out of here.
Get out of here.

50:59.867 --> 51:02.540
Leave me alone! All right?

51:03.826 --> 51:05.101
Charlie, get out of here!

51:08.388 --> 51:11.061
Yeah. All right.

51:11.228 --> 51:13.347
Shut your mouth.

51:14.671 --> 51:17.231
What are you still doing in here?
I told you to leave.

51:17.711 --> 51:21.342
Because this isn't your office. I left!
This is public property.

51:21.512 --> 51:23.629
- This isn't close to public property.
- Yes, it is!

51:23.793 --> 51:26.628
- Get out of here, man!
- I'll call the police if you don't leave.

51:26.795 --> 51:28.945
- It's okay. Let me handle it.
- No, it's not! He's...

51:29.115 --> 51:30.867
Melanie, shut the damn window!

51:33.517 --> 51:35.314
Jesus.

51:35.957 --> 51:38.835
We can't keep
doing this shit, Charlie.

51:49.561 --> 51:54.432
Look, I don't know what I said to you
in there that got you so pissed off...

51:54.603 --> 51:56.719
....but I'm sorry, Charlie, all right?

51:56.883 --> 51:58.158
All right.

51:58.324 --> 52:01.284
- Jesus.
- I know.

52:04.565 --> 52:07.206
- Dr. Johnson.
- Miss Remar.

52:07.367 --> 52:10.439
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah. Everything's good.

52:10.647 --> 52:13.847
- I have an appointment scheduled.
- Just check in with Melanie.

52:14.490 --> 52:17.527
- Maybe I should come back.
- No, no, it's fine. Just check in.

52:17.690 --> 52:19.568
Check in with Melanie.

52:25.372 --> 52:26.932
The one who...?

52:32.694 --> 52:35.130
Doctor will see you in the office.

52:44.579 --> 52:47.777
That gorgeous girl
wants to blow you?

52:47.940 --> 52:50.500
- Charlie, come on.
- She wants to blow you?

52:50.660 --> 52:51.889
- Look, get out...
- Come here.

52:52.061 --> 52:54.132
Are you crazy? Get out of here.

52:54.302 --> 52:55.621
- She's gorgeous.
- Yeah, I know.

52:55.782 --> 52:58.854
Way you were talking about... Thought
she was a beast or something.

52:59.022 --> 53:01.936
- I gotta straighten this out.
- All right, but how hot is that girl?

53:02.104 --> 53:03.901
- She's fine. She's hot.
- She's the hottest.

53:04.064 --> 53:06.339
- Is she not the hottest?
- Charlie, will you get out...?

53:06.505 --> 53:09.339
Let me go in for you.
Let me get the blowjob.

53:09.506 --> 53:11.940
- Let me see that woman.
- Oh, you're playful now? Get out.

53:12.106 --> 53:13.143
Stop it! Get out of here!

53:13.308 --> 53:15.459
Did you smell that?
She even smells good!

53:15.629 --> 53:16.857
Jesus.

53:17.028 --> 53:20.387
- I wanna know what is going on.
- Nothing is going on.

53:20.551 --> 53:22.506
- Don't tell me nothing's going on.
- Calm down.

53:22.671 --> 53:25.549
- Let me explain it, okay?
- All right, explain it.

53:28.473 --> 53:31.146
She's like out of a 1940s movie.

53:31.313 --> 53:33.703
Did you see that girl?

53:34.275 --> 53:37.585
I mean, that was just perfection.

53:46.358 --> 53:47.553
You okay?

53:47.719 --> 53:49.550
"Okay"?

53:50.399 --> 53:52.230
No, I wouldn't use that word.

53:53.761 --> 53:55.035
Well, thank you for seeing me.

53:55.201 --> 53:58.318
Did I have a choice, Miss Remar?
I mean...

53:58.481 --> 54:01.237
You've really put me in a terrible
position here at my office.

54:01.644 --> 54:04.238
Can we just cut to it?
I don't wanna take a lot of your time.

54:04.404 --> 54:05.882
Yeah.

54:06.404 --> 54:08.475
This letter...

54:09.686 --> 54:10.720
....that you sent my...

54:10.885 --> 54:12.922
I can do this quick.

54:13.086 --> 54:14.965
Wait a... No, no.

54:15.128 --> 54:16.480
Please.

54:21.170 --> 54:24.765
Recently, I've come through
a rotten divorce.

54:25.090 --> 54:27.765
I was married for 10 years.

54:27.932 --> 54:30.526
My husband was having
an affair for five of them.

54:31.372 --> 54:34.092
They had another life
here in the city.

54:34.254 --> 54:36.131
He had two lives.

54:36.294 --> 54:39.127
I was walking down the street
one day and I saw them.

54:39.294 --> 54:43.005
And I followed them,
and it was truly like a dream.

54:44.216 --> 54:46.366
I spoke to a neighbour
and she talked about them...

54:46.536 --> 54:50.578
....as if they were the Joneses
living next door all these years.

54:50.739 --> 54:54.892
And in that moment,
I lost my equilibrium.

54:55.261 --> 54:57.296
And I fell,
right there on the sidewalk.

54:57.460 --> 55:00.419
And the thing is, Dr. Johnson,
I haven't yet gotten up.

55:00.742 --> 55:03.735
Now, my behaviour towards you
is inexcusable, I know that.

55:03.943 --> 55:07.174
I behaved in a way
I don't normally behave.

55:07.343 --> 55:11.497
What I've done by even threatening
a lawsuit is so repulsive to me.

55:11.665 --> 55:14.021
I even lied to you when I told you
that my therapist...

55:14.186 --> 55:15.779
....had told me to act on my thoughts.

55:16.227 --> 55:20.220
I wanted to come in and see you
and tell you that I am so sorry.

55:20.387 --> 55:23.301
And that I am very embarrassed.

55:25.509 --> 55:27.979
And that you won't be having
any more trouble from me.

55:30.631 --> 55:33.099
- I promise that to you.
- Okay.

55:33.271 --> 55:34.261
Okay.

55:34.713 --> 55:38.388
- Okay. Well, I'll go now.
- Yeah.

55:48.296 --> 55:49.411
I'll leave.

56:32.673 --> 56:34.425
Elizabeth, can I get a cup of coffee?

56:34.593 --> 56:36.232
Sure. Dr. Johnson,
do you want anything?

56:36.393 --> 56:38.542
No, he's fine.

56:39.871 --> 56:42.387
Me? Get him to talk?

56:42.554 --> 56:44.065
No way. That's not what I do.

56:44.232 --> 56:45.950
Well, he needs to talk to somebody.

56:46.112 --> 56:48.787
He's in trouble.
He needs to see somebody.

56:48.954 --> 56:52.546
He's got you. He's got a friend.
That's big. That's a major step.

56:52.711 --> 56:54.781
No, he needs more help
than I can give him.

56:55.112 --> 56:57.988
What, are you gonna save him now?
Is that what this is all about?

57:02.273 --> 57:03.750
I was his best friend.

57:03.910 --> 57:06.662
His golfing
and his fishing buddy, okay?

57:06.830 --> 57:09.186
- Our families vacationed together.
- Okay.

57:09.352 --> 57:11.910
On September 12th, 2001,
that was over.

57:12.071 --> 57:13.503
He wants nothing to do with me.

57:14.152 --> 57:15.983
Nothing to do with my wife.

57:16.153 --> 57:18.108
He likes you, Alan. You know why?

57:18.791 --> 57:20.464
- Why?
- It's very simple.

57:20.872 --> 57:25.023
Because you know nothing about
Doreen and Jenny and Julie and Gina.

57:25.191 --> 57:27.546
Or Spider, the family poodle.

57:28.350 --> 57:31.263
You know nothing about them,
so he figures you won't ask questions.

57:31.431 --> 57:33.820
He figures you'll just let him be.

57:34.789 --> 57:36.860
Now, how funny is this?

57:37.030 --> 57:39.384
That you're up here wanting me
to help out in another...

57:39.549 --> 57:42.017
....fruitless campaign
to get Charlie to see a shrink.

57:42.951 --> 57:47.501
The one guy he figures
would just let him be.

57:56.030 --> 57:57.461
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:57.629 --> 57:59.266
I think I'm gonna get him some help.

57:59.748 --> 58:01.228
Charlie.

58:01.390 --> 58:03.109
Did he ask you for help?

58:03.270 --> 58:04.542
Well, he needs help.

58:04.709 --> 58:07.746
He's gotta get back in the game.
He's gotta get his life back.

58:07.908 --> 58:10.866
The people around him right now,
they're just enabling him.

58:11.749 --> 58:14.865
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I mean, what do the experts say?

58:18.147 --> 58:21.504
I don't know. I'll find out.

58:21.667 --> 58:23.738
I know he needs help.

58:24.267 --> 58:28.704
You think you have time for all this?
I mean, with work and your mom and...

58:29.550 --> 58:34.223
I know you don't think so,
but I'm trying to help him.

58:34.387 --> 58:36.776
Trying to help my friend.

58:42.027 --> 58:43.587
Okay.

58:49.469 --> 58:52.663
- Want some breakfast?
- Yeah. Thank you.

58:55.106 --> 58:58.462
Just glad you wanted to do this
just out of nowhere.

58:58.626 --> 59:01.584
You know, I think it's about time
you get your head around what is...

59:01.746 --> 59:03.227
....and what isn't good music.

59:03.388 --> 59:05.662
Oh, right, right, right.

59:05.826 --> 59:08.387
Oh, Graham Nash.
Songs For Beginners.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.820
Just the album cover alone.

59:10.986 --> 59:13.418
Look at that face.
He knows he made a great record.

59:13.585 --> 59:15.143
Oh, okay, wait. Right here.

59:15.303 --> 59:17.454
Okay. We got O'Jays.

59:17.624 --> 59:19.422
We got... What else we got?

59:19.584 --> 59:21.859
The Soul Tr... Hey.
From the Funk Side.

59:22.023 --> 59:24.380
Now, what record collection's
complete without this?

59:24.544 --> 59:26.979
I'll put that on my list.

59:29.667 --> 59:30.813
Hey, Alan.

59:30.984 --> 59:32.304
- Oh, hey, Nigel.
- Hey.

59:32.466 --> 59:34.819
- How are you?
- Good. What are you doing here?

59:34.984 --> 59:37.863
Oh, I'm just sort of rummaging.

59:38.104 --> 59:40.094
I'm a vinyl hound. I love this stuff.

59:40.263 --> 59:43.258
Yeah. Hey, Charlie, this is
a good friend of mine, Nigel.

59:43.426 --> 59:44.982
Nigel, Charlie Fineman.

59:45.145 --> 59:46.974
Charlie Fineman, Nigel.

59:47.144 --> 59:49.418
Billy Joel, Cold Spring Harbor.

59:49.585 --> 59:52.462
They recorded this at too high
of a speed, so it was unreleasable.

59:52.624 --> 59:54.375
Eventually it came out, though.

59:54.543 --> 59:56.537
He grew up two towns away
from where I grew up.

59:56.705 --> 59:59.172
We used to go to the same
White Castle.

01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:02.577
Say, do you guys wanna
get some lunch after this?

01:00:03.064 --> 01:00:05.496
Yeah. What do you think, Charlie?

01:00:07.663 --> 01:00:09.574
I just wanna stay here.

01:00:09.744 --> 01:00:11.653
Well, afterwards.
I just thought, you know...

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:14.542
....let's go get some lunch
with Nigel.

01:00:16.183 --> 01:00:17.333
Can I talk to you?

01:00:20.623 --> 01:00:23.057
I don't wanna eat with that guy.
He's a dork.

01:00:23.224 --> 01:00:25.737
I mean, look at him,
he's a giant dork.

01:00:25.903 --> 01:00:28.462
Looks like a lump of shit
that someone left on the sidewalk.

01:00:28.623 --> 01:00:29.977
- Charlie, come on.
- Admit it.

01:00:30.144 --> 01:00:31.974
He's a dork.
Tell me he's not a dork.

01:00:32.142 --> 01:00:35.098
Charlie, I'm pretty sure
he can hear you.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.335
So, what do you do, Charlie?

01:00:42.581 --> 01:00:43.857
I'm a collector.

01:00:44.381 --> 01:00:46.576
Really? What do you collect?

01:00:47.261 --> 01:00:49.454
What do I collect?

01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:52.539
I don't know.
Johnson, you can answer for me.

01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:53.974
What do I collect?

01:00:57.022 --> 01:00:58.614
Charlie collects
things from his life.

01:00:58.782 --> 01:01:03.412
You know, things that he finds
germane to his lifestyle.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.052
And how would you describe
your lifestyle, Charlie?

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.299
I noticed in the record store, you were
holding up a Bob Seger album.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.176
Are you a Seger man, Nigel?

01:01:16.822 --> 01:01:17.808
Love Seger, yes.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.969
Yeah.

01:01:19.139 --> 01:01:21.608
Smokin' O.P. 's, Mongrel.

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:23.054
When'd you get into him?

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.449
Probably later.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.814
Silver Bullet or Seger System?

01:01:28.899 --> 01:01:31.094
Well, actually, I don't like
either of those albums.

01:01:31.419 --> 01:01:34.138
That's funny, because they're
not albums. Those are his bands.

01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:38.416
Seger's an artist. A genius.

01:01:38.578 --> 01:01:40.730
An American original.

01:01:40.899 --> 01:01:42.378
And what are you, Nigel?

01:01:42.537 --> 01:01:44.848
A therapist? Is that it?

01:01:45.018 --> 01:01:47.657
You sizing me up? You on the
case now? You gonna fix me?

01:01:47.818 --> 01:01:51.175
No, look, I was out for a nice
afternoon, I ran into my old friend...

01:01:51.339 --> 01:01:53.976
Oh, bullshit.
You stink like a shrink.

01:01:54.139 --> 01:01:55.571
You got shrink hands.

01:01:55.738 --> 01:01:58.093
- You ordered your salad like a shrink.
- Okay.

01:01:58.497 --> 01:02:01.648
- Let's stop. This was my mistake.
- No, this is good.

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:04.413
- How does a shrink order a salad?
- Don't, Nigel.

01:02:04.577 --> 01:02:06.932
- In your opinion. I'd like to know.
- Let's go outside.

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.610
I'm gonna beat your ass.
I will beat your ass, shrink-wrap.

01:02:09.937 --> 01:02:12.974
Seger fan. You'd get your ass kicked
at a fucking Seger concert.

01:02:13.137 --> 01:02:15.411
- Charlie.
- Get the fuck up! Get up!

01:02:15.576 --> 01:02:18.614
I made you in the record store
the minute I saw your dorky face.

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:19.892
Outside!

01:02:20.056 --> 01:02:21.809
Okay, Charlie, calm down.

01:02:31.178 --> 01:02:33.007
You liar.

01:03:07.853 --> 01:03:08.890
Hey.

01:03:10.014 --> 01:03:11.449
Hey.

01:03:15.815 --> 01:03:18.125
The girls still at gymnastics?

01:03:18.975 --> 01:03:20.373
Yep.

01:03:24.014 --> 01:03:25.846
I'm gonna go wash up.

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:27.726
I made dinner.

01:03:27.894 --> 01:03:30.203
Where were you, at Charlie's?

01:03:31.854 --> 01:03:34.413
You know what
the whole problem is?

01:03:34.574 --> 01:03:36.849
This whole Charlie problem?

01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:38.364
You're jealous of him.

01:03:39.253 --> 01:03:41.006
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:03:41.173 --> 01:03:43.607
I have a friend, I'm spending time
away from the house...

01:03:43.773 --> 01:03:46.605
....and it's got your feathers ruffled.
You are jealous of Charlie.

01:03:46.772 --> 01:03:48.602
I actually think
you're jealous of Charlie.

01:03:48.772 --> 01:03:51.810
He's caught up in this world of pain,
thick like quicksand...

01:03:51.972 --> 01:03:54.931
....and your only response
is to covet his freedom.

01:03:55.094 --> 01:03:56.207
That is sick, Janeane.

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:58.603
- Is it?
- What, I'm jealous of that?

01:03:58.774 --> 01:04:01.333
Just because the guy can, what,
do whatever he wants now...

01:04:01.491 --> 01:04:04.086
....and he's got the freedom to just...

01:04:04.253 --> 01:04:06.766
I mean, you think I'm jealous of that?
I covet that?

01:04:06.933 --> 01:04:09.286
You need to check yourself.
That is... That's sick.

01:04:09.452 --> 01:04:10.885
What happened to that woman?

01:04:11.093 --> 01:04:13.003
The one that wanted to
go down on you?

01:04:13.173 --> 01:04:16.243
I talked to Melanie at the office,
and she said you made it go away.

01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:19.210
- Wait a minute. You called Melanie?
- Yes, I did.

01:04:19.372 --> 01:04:21.203
So you're checking up
on me now, Janeane?

01:04:21.371 --> 01:04:24.762
Alan, I gotta talk to somebody,
because you're not talking to me.

01:04:24.932 --> 01:04:27.844
- She's right. I made it go away.
- I'd like to know how you did that.

01:04:28.011 --> 01:04:29.762
I invited the woman in,
I shut the door...

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:32.046
....I hopped on the desk
and I just let her do it.

01:04:32.372 --> 01:04:33.724
That's real mature, Alan.

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:35.608
Well, listen to what
you're saying to me.

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:38.729
What are you insinuating?
You don't know me better than that?

01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:41.722
I'm gonna go take a walk.

01:04:41.891 --> 01:04:43.084
Say hi to Charlie.

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:44.446
Don't do that. Don't.

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:46.408
Don't act like you know what I'm...

01:04:46.571 --> 01:04:48.051
Did I say I was going to Charlie's?

01:04:48.209 --> 01:04:51.486
Don't do that.
You're not in my head.

01:04:51.651 --> 01:04:53.129
Send him my love.

01:04:53.771 --> 01:04:55.726
See? You want...

01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:59.202
And if l... Then...

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:02.409
Okay.

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:04.082
Okay.

01:05:08.131 --> 01:05:11.247
Charlie Fineman to see Dr. Johnson.

01:05:19.888 --> 01:05:22.275
- Did you wanna talk, Charlie?
- I'll wait. It's private.

01:05:22.449 --> 01:05:25.646
Oh, well, you can speak freely.
I mean, this one's totally knocked out.

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.401
She's a thousand miles away.

01:05:27.568 --> 01:05:30.321
And Anna's from Guatemala.
She just got to this country recently.

01:05:30.488 --> 01:05:32.128
She doesn't even speak English.

01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:34.929
Anna, Charlie's a superhero
from outer space...

01:05:35.088 --> 01:05:38.319
....and he stuffs the front of his tights
with a sock.

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:42.286
You are very nice.

01:05:43.128 --> 01:05:45.164
See? Privacy.

01:05:50.767 --> 01:05:55.522
I was thinking about it,
and you were right.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:59.564
I do need to get some help.

01:05:59.727 --> 01:06:01.207
- I wanna get help.
- That's great.

01:06:01.367 --> 01:06:06.645
Yeah. I just... I gotta be
really careful, though, I don't...

01:06:07.408 --> 01:06:09.796
I just know I'm better off
not having certain thoughts.

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.240
You're doing the right thing...

01:06:11.406 --> 01:06:13.602
....because you need help
to process those thoughts.

01:06:13.766 --> 01:06:15.881
Well, I don't want it to be
that bozo Nigel.

01:06:16.046 --> 01:06:17.797
- No.
- He's a dork.

01:06:17.966 --> 01:06:20.116
He's the biggest dork
I've ever seen.

01:06:20.287 --> 01:06:21.685
- Yeah, I get it.
- All right.

01:06:21.848 --> 01:06:22.914
I get it.

01:06:31.245 --> 01:06:32.759
That was seriously fucked up, Alan.

01:06:32.926 --> 01:06:35.484
I didn't know he was
gonna say all that shit.

01:06:42.844 --> 01:06:44.277
Angela?

01:06:44.444 --> 01:06:46.276
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:06:48.124 --> 01:06:49.715
- How you doing?
- Good, thank you. You?

01:06:49.883 --> 01:06:52.036
- Good. Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

01:06:52.205 --> 01:06:55.402
Charlie, this is Angela. Angela, this is
Charlie. He's my college roommate.

01:06:55.564 --> 01:06:57.680
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

01:07:00.844 --> 01:07:04.518
Well, thanks for seeing us
on such short notice.

01:07:04.683 --> 01:07:07.403
Why don't you guys come in
and make yourselves comfortable?

01:07:07.563 --> 01:07:09.554
I was just gonna grab a coffee.
Anyone?

01:07:09.722 --> 01:07:10.714
No, I'm good.

01:07:10.883 --> 01:07:12.282
Charlie?

01:07:13.923 --> 01:07:16.436
Are you kidding me? She's a baby.

01:07:16.602 --> 01:07:18.082
Listen, you're right. She's young.

01:07:18.242 --> 01:07:21.521
But she's good. A lot of experience
with loss and grief counselling.

01:07:21.683 --> 01:07:24.118
She's got nice tits. That's not good.

01:07:24.282 --> 01:07:26.003
Since when?

01:07:27.203 --> 01:07:28.396
Good point.

01:07:28.562 --> 01:07:30.996
We'll do the meet-and-greet,
you'll see what you think...

01:07:31.162 --> 01:07:32.678
....if you like her,
we go from there.

01:07:32.845 --> 01:07:35.719
- Am I wrong about her tits?
- No, you're right. They're wonderful.

01:07:36.043 --> 01:07:38.555
So, what are you guys talking about?
What's so wonderful?

01:07:50.602 --> 01:07:51.953
Well, think about it, Charlie...

01:07:52.122 --> 01:07:56.354
....and call me or have Alan call me
and we'll schedule something.

01:07:56.521 --> 01:07:57.795
- Donna, hi.
- I'm early.

01:07:57.961 --> 01:08:00.271
- Yeah.
- Dr. Johnson. How are you?

01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:01.874
- I'm fine.
- I'm early.

01:08:02.041 --> 01:08:03.600
Okay.

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:08.235
Oh, Donna, this is Charlie.
You remember Donna, right?

01:08:08.402 --> 01:08:09.720
She's early.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.870
- Hi.
- We were just wrapping up.

01:08:12.038 --> 01:08:16.318
- Are you a patient of Angela's?
- I didn't agree to that yet.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.948
But you are.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:21.113
And it's because you're her...

01:08:21.361 --> 01:08:22.679
And you two are...

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.035
- Yes.
- We should get started.

01:08:24.202 --> 01:08:26.353
- And we have a session now, so...
- Let's get going.

01:08:26.522 --> 01:08:28.670
We should get started.
I'm sorry about the overlap.

01:08:28.841 --> 01:08:30.751
Charlie, nice to meet you.
Alan, thank you.

01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:34.229
Better bring out the big guns for this
one. She's crazy with a side of crazy.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:36.037
- Bye.
- Just saying. Protect yourself.

01:08:38.959 --> 01:08:40.676
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:08:40.839 --> 01:08:44.149
Just make sure they never
schedule me near that girl, all right?

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.307
I would...

01:08:45.478 --> 01:08:48.198
No, it's just, I never wanna
see her again. That's trouble.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:49.756
She's too good-Iooking, I just...

01:08:51.158 --> 01:08:55.711
Nobody has a right to look that good.
It's trouble for everybody.

01:08:55.959 --> 01:08:57.995
Okay, Charlie.

01:09:03.879 --> 01:09:07.712
So have you thought at all about
what you'd like to talk about today?

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.232
And how you wanna start this?

01:09:09.398 --> 01:09:10.912
Not really.

01:09:11.078 --> 01:09:14.069
I don't know. I'm good.

01:09:14.238 --> 01:09:15.229
You're good?

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:16.955
I'm okay.

01:09:17.118 --> 01:09:18.515
That's good.

01:09:19.599 --> 01:09:21.395
What makes you okay?

01:09:23.477 --> 01:09:25.229
I don't know.

01:09:26.438 --> 01:09:28.952
Can I just say something?
You're too young. You're a baby.

01:09:29.796 --> 01:09:31.595
I can't do this.

01:09:32.515 --> 01:09:35.077
What can I do
to help you, Charlie?

01:09:35.477 --> 01:09:38.310
How can someone
like me help you?

01:09:41.957 --> 01:09:44.551
I have these things...

01:09:45.354 --> 01:09:48.314
....that I don't like to think about.

01:09:51.836 --> 01:09:55.068
You're too young. You're too young.
I can't do this.

01:09:55.237 --> 01:09:57.705
I gotta put these back on.

01:09:57.877 --> 01:09:59.547
That's okay.

01:10:02.077 --> 01:10:04.431
So how are you, Charlie?
How was your week?

01:10:05.116 --> 01:10:06.515
It was good.

01:10:06.677 --> 01:10:10.350
Except I was angry.

01:10:11.156 --> 01:10:13.511
- I was pretty mad.
- Who were you mad at?

01:10:13.678 --> 01:10:15.552
I was mad at you.

01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:19.469
- I didn't really wanna come back here.
- Why didn't you wanna come back?

01:10:19.634 --> 01:10:23.308
Well, you know why. Every week,
you try to make me do it again.

01:10:25.274 --> 01:10:27.153
What do I try
to make you do, Charlie?

01:10:27.315 --> 01:10:30.066
Talk about things
I don't wanna talk about.

01:10:30.234 --> 01:10:33.544
Well, for the last few weeks, you've
been saying you were getting ready...

01:10:33.715 --> 01:10:36.990
....to talk about some of those...
- No, goddamn it, that was you!

01:10:37.155 --> 01:10:39.269
I didn't say that, you did!

01:10:39.434 --> 01:10:42.632
I don't wanna talk about those things.
I don't remember.

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:44.702
I'm sorry.

01:10:45.553 --> 01:10:49.343
I'm glad you came in,
even though you were mad at me.

01:10:49.514 --> 01:10:52.028
Yeah. I am too.

01:10:53.154 --> 01:10:54.825
Can I say something, Charlie?

01:10:56.555 --> 01:10:59.147
- Yeah.
- It might make you mad again.

01:10:59.311 --> 01:11:00.793
No.

01:11:01.392 --> 01:11:02.793
Go.

01:11:03.672 --> 01:11:06.982
There is no point
in you coming here every week...

01:11:07.154 --> 01:11:09.383
....if we eventually
don't discuss your life...

01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:12.581
....and discuss your family.

01:11:14.553 --> 01:11:16.270
Is this session over yet?

01:11:17.233 --> 01:11:18.985
No, it just started.

01:11:19.153 --> 01:11:20.712
Can it be?

01:11:24.072 --> 01:11:26.027
If you want it to be, yes.

01:11:28.352 --> 01:11:32.584
Charlie, before you go, I'd just...
I'd like to say something.

01:11:33.471 --> 01:11:37.351
Look, the fact is you had a family...

01:11:37.712 --> 01:11:39.382
....and you suffered a great loss...

01:11:39.791 --> 01:11:44.741
....and until you can discuss that
and we can really talk about that...

01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:48.985
....this is all just an exercise.

01:11:49.231 --> 01:11:50.789
I can be patient, Charlie...

01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:55.867
....but you need
to tell someone your story.

01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:01.543
It doesn't have to be me,
but someone.

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:26.657
Charlie, wait a second. You didn't tell
me that this guy's partner was black.

01:12:26.829 --> 01:12:29.297
I mean, that makes this
almost bearable.

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:34.981
Why do they gotta give him
the green V plunge...?

01:12:35.148 --> 01:12:38.266
I mean, that's... Why'd they do that?
That's kind of faggoty.

01:12:42.507 --> 01:12:44.385
I had three daughters.

01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:48.384
- I know.
- Gina was 5. She was...

01:12:49.389 --> 01:12:51.060
Jenny...

01:12:51.228 --> 01:12:53.059
....was 7.

01:12:53.708 --> 01:12:55.143
She...

01:12:57.469 --> 01:12:58.786
She liked boys already.

01:12:59.747 --> 01:13:04.298
Julie was 9. She was older.

01:13:04.467 --> 01:13:06.423
They all looked alike, Johnson.

01:13:07.587 --> 01:13:09.464
Like Doreen.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:12.342
Doreen was my wife.

01:13:12.747 --> 01:13:15.944
D.T. That was her nickname.

01:13:16.108 --> 01:13:18.177
Doreen Timpleman.

01:13:18.507 --> 01:13:22.863
She had a dog, Spider.
Spider. A poodle.

01:13:25.386 --> 01:13:29.299
They'd wake me up all the time,
Saturday mornings, you know...

01:13:29.467 --> 01:13:32.584
....singing Beatles songs
to me, in harmony.

01:13:32.747 --> 01:13:34.498
The four of them.

01:13:34.747 --> 01:13:36.101
So cute.

01:13:36.706 --> 01:13:38.776
So cute.

01:13:39.586 --> 01:13:43.625
Doreen never, never judged me.

01:13:43.827 --> 01:13:45.339
You know?

01:13:46.666 --> 01:13:49.896
Never nagged, like some wives do.

01:13:50.066 --> 01:13:53.899
She just wanted me to
take my shoes off...

01:13:54.065 --> 01:13:58.023
....so I didn't wreck the carpet.
That's it.

01:14:03.784 --> 01:14:06.935
Doreen and the girls
were very female.

01:14:08.424 --> 01:14:12.257
I was the oddball, you know?

01:14:13.424 --> 01:14:15.496
Mr. Man.

01:14:18.424 --> 01:14:21.222
They adored me, Johnson.

01:14:22.985 --> 01:14:26.977
I bet they did.
I know they did, Charlie.

01:14:27.143 --> 01:14:29.941
They had long brown hair...

01:14:31.263 --> 01:14:36.735
....except little Gina.
She kept her hair short, you know.

01:14:37.143 --> 01:14:39.611
To be different from everybody.

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:43.775
She...

01:14:44.544 --> 01:14:46.977
She had a birthmark too.

01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:49.338
Looked like a burn...

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:51.613
....but it wasn't.

01:14:55.222 --> 01:14:57.530
When she was little,
they said it was gonna go away...

01:14:57.703 --> 01:14:59.692
....but it never did.

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:05.253
Jenny. Jenny, this one...

01:15:05.421 --> 01:15:08.572
....she wanted to be a gymnast.

01:15:11.023 --> 01:15:13.057
She was such a klutz, though.

01:15:13.222 --> 01:15:16.816
I didn't have the heart
to mention it as a problem.

01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:27.895
They went to see...

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:31.770
....Doreen's sister, Ellen,
and her girls in Boston...

01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:34.817
....and they took Spider because...

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.860
....I had to work
and they didn't trust me to feed her.

01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:41.695
But that was a joke, right?
And then...

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.372
....we were all going to D.T.'s
little cousin's wedding...

01:15:45.539 --> 01:15:49.454
....in Los Angeles,
and I was gonna meet them out there.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:53.375
The kids wanted to go
to Disneyland...

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.613
....but they had... They were already
gonna miss a couple days of school...

01:15:57.781 --> 01:16:00.090
....so we had to say no.

01:16:00.541 --> 01:16:02.018
You know.

01:16:06.499 --> 01:16:09.889
So I'm going on out to meet them
in Los Angeles.

01:16:10.059 --> 01:16:13.175
And on my way to JFK,
I'm in the taxicab...

01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.900
....and I hear on the radio...

01:16:21.178 --> 01:16:26.776
I get there and some man tells me
the plane's from Boston.

01:16:28.537 --> 01:16:31.770
Some other guy
says there's two planes.

01:16:35.738 --> 01:16:39.936
Then I go inside the airport
and I'm watching...

01:16:40.099 --> 01:16:42.932
I'm watching on the television
and l...

01:16:43.419 --> 01:16:46.569
And I saw it.

01:16:47.977 --> 01:16:51.857
I saw it and I felt it at the same time.

01:16:59.656 --> 01:17:03.126
I thought about Gina's birthmark...

01:17:04.057 --> 01:17:05.570
....and l...

01:17:06.295 --> 01:17:08.604
I felt them burning.

01:17:23.976 --> 01:17:25.375
Can we go?

01:17:26.536 --> 01:17:28.890
I wanna go home now.

01:17:33.376 --> 01:17:35.285
I don't like this.

01:17:36.576 --> 01:17:38.453
I don't like doing it.

01:17:40.935 --> 01:17:42.766
Remembering.

01:17:43.135 --> 01:17:45.365
I don't like remembering.

01:18:15.933 --> 01:18:18.654
New York One has gotten
evidence of a credible terror threat...

01:18:18.813 --> 01:18:20.566
....and New York City
may be a target.

01:18:20.735 --> 01:18:23.247
As a result, the terror-alert status
has been raised.

01:18:23.414 --> 01:18:26.804
City officials are beefing up security
on our subways, buses and airports.

01:18:26.972 --> 01:18:29.007
Specifics about the threat
haven't been released.

01:18:29.172 --> 01:18:32.323
Cops won't confirm whether there's
a link to the al Qaeda terror group...

01:19:02.251 --> 01:19:04.242
For Americans and Iraqis alik e...

01:19:04.411 --> 01:19:06.288
....today's violent demonstrations...

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:11.002
....were just another long chapter
in the ongoing war on terror.

01:19:11.171 --> 01:19:13.686
In Baghdad, a cop...

01:20:54.046 --> 01:20:55.558
Charlie?

01:20:56.126 --> 01:20:59.516
Charlie, are you here?

01:21:01.966 --> 01:21:05.754
Lincoln next door called to say that
you were listening to the TV too loud.

01:21:06.686 --> 01:21:09.359
I said you didn't listen
to the TV, but...

01:21:11.204 --> 01:21:12.843
Are you okay?

01:21:13.684 --> 01:21:15.243
Charlie.

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:18.324
Charlie.

01:21:31.124 --> 01:21:32.717
What's wrong with you?

01:23:00.002 --> 01:23:02.434
- What are you doing, man?
- You fucking almost hit me.

01:23:02.601 --> 01:23:05.193
- What are you, drunk?
- Are you drunk? You almost hit me.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.111
Get out of the way
before I run you over.

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:09.156
You run me over? Come on.
Come run me over.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.709
Come and run me over!

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.633
Look out! Get out of the way!

01:23:13.041 --> 01:23:15.076
Okay, friend, drop the gun!

01:23:15.521 --> 01:23:19.399
N.Y.P. D! Drop the gun now!
N.Y.P. D!

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.471
Drop the gun!
Andrew, where are you, man?

01:23:21.639 --> 01:23:23.596
- This guy's crazy!
- It's good.

01:23:23.839 --> 01:23:25.990
- Andrew!
- Just do it. Come on, do it.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.991
- Andrew, where are you?
- Do it.

01:23:28.159 --> 01:23:30.467
- I'm gonna toast him, Andrew!
- Do it.

01:23:33.039 --> 01:23:35.188
- Get him the fuck down!
- Do not move a muscle.

01:23:35.359 --> 01:23:38.953
Don't ever point a gun at me again.
I should've fucking shot you.

01:23:39.118 --> 01:23:41.950
- Get up. Get up.
- Get up on your feet now!

01:23:42.119 --> 01:23:43.835
- Against the wall.
- Up against the wall.

01:23:43.998 --> 01:23:47.707
Get the fuck up, you bastard!
What the fuck you think this is?

01:23:48.677 --> 01:23:51.590
Stay the fuck up! Get the fuck up!

01:24:01.838 --> 01:24:05.591
Alan, say hi to Pete Savarino,
Charlie's attorney.

01:24:05.757 --> 01:24:07.078
This is Alan Johnson.

01:24:07.757 --> 01:24:09.714
All the criminal charges
are gonna be dropped.

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:11.912
- That's good.
- The city doesn't wanna make...

01:24:12.077 --> 01:24:13.350
....a big case out of this.

01:24:13.517 --> 01:24:17.032
A 9l11 widower gets beat up
by the cops. Doesn't look good.

01:24:17.197 --> 01:24:19.187
So we're gonna go a different way.

01:24:19.357 --> 01:24:22.429
They wanna do a three-day psych
evaluation at Roosevelt Hospital.

01:24:22.595 --> 01:24:24.746
That's standard procedure.

01:24:25.355 --> 01:24:27.427
Well, it's better than jail, I guess,
but Jesus...

01:24:30.516 --> 01:24:31.709
Here you go.

01:24:31.876 --> 01:24:33.991
Here, talk to him and
I'll get the paperwork done.

01:24:34.157 --> 01:24:35.669
Okay.

01:24:52.474 --> 01:24:54.033
You okay?

01:25:00.155 --> 01:25:02.190
What's gonna happen?

01:25:04.354 --> 01:25:07.267
Well, they wanna hold on to you...

01:25:08.034 --> 01:25:13.188
....for a few days and do
a psych evaluation, you know.

01:25:15.754 --> 01:25:17.823
Angela and I, we're gonna...

01:25:17.993 --> 01:25:21.146
- We're gonna follow you and...
- Okay.

01:25:21.314 --> 01:25:25.308
I'll get you settled in,
make sure everything's all right.

01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:33.983
I'm really sorry, Charlie.
I feel like this is my fault.

01:25:34.154 --> 01:25:36.384
You know, like I pushed you
too hard.

01:25:38.153 --> 01:25:40.064
I just wanted you to...

01:25:42.473 --> 01:25:44.862
....be better or something,
I don't know.

01:25:46.592 --> 01:25:48.151
I'm sorry.

01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:28.069
When you feel uncomfortable,
you let me know, all right?

01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:44.188
- Are you calm?
- I'm good.

01:26:46.348 --> 01:26:49.980
But something that you are not doing
has brought him here to this point.

01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:52.140
That's completely irrelevant.

01:26:52.309 --> 01:26:55.269
I will see to it that he has
proper out-post treatment...

01:26:55.429 --> 01:26:56.749
....and I will take care of him.

01:26:56.910 --> 01:27:00.218
Please don't tell me how to do my job.
I understand what is needed here.

01:27:00.391 --> 01:27:02.381
I'm not wanting him to...

01:27:13.427 --> 01:27:14.499
Sign out.

01:27:29.188 --> 01:27:31.575
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

01:27:50.069 --> 01:27:52.502
Listen, Charlie, there's gonna be a...

01:27:52.668 --> 01:27:55.262
A hearing Friday morning.

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:59.104
The DA's office
wants you back in here.

01:28:00.866 --> 01:28:03.017
They wanna have you committed.

01:28:06.665 --> 01:28:09.943
They wanna have the right
to hold on to you for up to a year.

01:28:10.106 --> 01:28:12.061
That's what they're saying.

01:28:13.425 --> 01:28:15.577
The hospital staff
is recommending it as well...

01:28:15.745 --> 01:28:19.658
....and the Timplemans,
they're onboard with it too.

01:28:21.667 --> 01:28:23.578
The Timplemans?

01:28:32.145 --> 01:28:34.785
Can we go get Chinese now?

01:29:08.184 --> 01:29:11.858
You know what it is? Janeane and I
are just up under each other too much.

01:29:12.024 --> 01:29:13.978
She's always asking me
to open up, you know...

01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:16.611
....talk to her, and then I do...

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:20.855
....and everything gets so personal,
and the whole thing just goes to shit.

01:29:21.021 --> 01:29:22.298
Yeah.

01:29:22.464 --> 01:29:25.579
Says she wants to hear what I have
to say. She doesn't wanna hear it.

01:29:28.263 --> 01:29:32.051
- Well, what do you have to say?
- That I need some air.

01:29:33.022 --> 01:29:34.419
You know?

01:29:34.663 --> 01:29:37.654
I mean, I love her.
I'm still in love with her.

01:29:38.342 --> 01:29:41.137
But, come on,
give me some air, man.

01:29:41.822 --> 01:29:45.814
I mean, it's like I'm not even
me anymore. You know?

01:29:47.579 --> 01:29:50.814
I'm not some damn
Siamese twin, I'm me.

01:29:50.981 --> 01:29:53.939
And that shouldn't piss her off.
It's just... It shouldn't.

01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:58.619
You wanna know what I remember
about you from college?

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:03.541
Nobody ever gave you any shit.

01:30:04.822 --> 01:30:07.209
You didn't take shit from anybody.

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.578
You know what else?

01:30:14.219 --> 01:30:17.895
I hate what I do.
You know, the money's good.

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:21.496
But I swear to God, I hate putting
phoney teeth on phoney people.

01:30:21.662 --> 01:30:25.447
But don't get me wrong. I'm a dentist,
and when people need it, that's great.

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.211
I feel for them.
But some assholes...

01:30:27.379 --> 01:30:29.416
....I just wanna slap them
in the head and say:

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:31.376
"Get your ass out on the street."
You know?

01:30:31.539 --> 01:30:34.895
"There's a lot worse things
to worry about than your teeth."

01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.056
So, what's going on with this...

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.455
....kitchen-remodelling thing?
What's up with that?

01:30:54.777 --> 01:30:57.338
What else could you do
besides veneers?

01:30:57.499 --> 01:31:00.933
No, no. Don't change the subject.
What's going on with that?

01:31:01.096 --> 01:31:04.933
Come on, tell me.
What's up with the kitchen thing?

01:31:07.736 --> 01:31:09.091
Tell me.

01:31:12.817 --> 01:31:16.333
The last time I spoke to Doreen...

01:31:20.578 --> 01:31:23.696
....she was at the airport in Boston.

01:31:25.737 --> 01:31:27.330
She wanted...

01:31:28.777 --> 01:31:31.975
Wanted to talk to me...

01:31:33.337 --> 01:31:34.769
....about the kitchen remodel...

01:31:34.936 --> 01:31:40.057
....that she and the girls
wanted to do.

01:31:40.216 --> 01:31:43.571
And I was busy,
running out the door...

01:31:48.855 --> 01:31:52.211
....and I fucking snapped at her.

01:31:56.697 --> 01:32:00.973
Oh, man, the last time
I fucking spoke to her.

01:32:05.695 --> 01:32:08.254
I hated kitchen talk.

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:16.611
I think you gotta let that go, Charlie.

01:32:19.895 --> 01:32:22.773
I'm sure you said a lot of nice shit
to her before then, man.

01:32:26.095 --> 01:32:28.527
It's one thing, man. Just let it go.

01:32:30.215 --> 01:32:32.774
- Yeah?
- Hell, yeah.

01:32:40.213 --> 01:32:42.443
Are you gonna be all right, Charlie?

01:32:44.454 --> 01:32:45.647
You're gonna make it, right?

01:32:50.456 --> 01:32:53.173
I'm more worried
about you, Johnson.

01:32:59.933 --> 01:33:02.365
I'm more worried about you.

01:33:13.213 --> 01:33:17.889
If you listen carefully, you'll be able
to hear assholes puckering, okay?

01:33:18.052 --> 01:33:19.724
Go, go, go.

01:33:24.852 --> 01:33:26.001
Hello.

01:33:26.172 --> 01:33:27.844
Listen up.

01:33:28.212 --> 01:33:31.760
If I ever happen to get into a situation
with a patient again...

01:33:31.932 --> 01:33:33.968
....I don't care what it does
to our liability...

01:33:34.132 --> 01:33:36.601
....you know what you're gonna do?
You're gonna back me up.

01:33:37.052 --> 01:33:38.451
I put this practise together...

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:41.332
....and I made you all
filthy stinking rich.

01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:42.924
Especially you, Stelter.

01:33:44.532 --> 01:33:47.761
Got a problem with what I'm saying,
take your ass back to Brooklyn...

01:33:47.931 --> 01:33:49.924
....and get whacked around
with insurance cases.

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:52.127
That's it. I'm sick of playing
with candy-asses.

01:33:52.291 --> 01:33:55.837
You know, Alan, I really think
this is inappropriate.

01:33:56.369 --> 01:33:57.963
I don't care what you think.

01:33:58.130 --> 01:34:01.361
This isn't a discussion.
It's a warning.

01:34:01.529 --> 01:34:03.565
There's gonna be some changes
made around here...

01:34:03.729 --> 01:34:05.323
....and you may not all make the cut.

01:34:12.489 --> 01:34:13.479
As you were.

01:34:16.168 --> 01:34:18.285
The new champ.

01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:21.279
No, no. You were in there with me.
It's what you said.

01:34:21.451 --> 01:34:24.726
See, that's the old college Johnson.
That's taking-no-shit Johnson.

01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:26.607
I gotta...

01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:31.399
Unfortunately, I think I was
thinking about another guy we know.

01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:33.798
Handleman, Andrew Handleman.

01:34:33.969 --> 01:34:36.037
- He didn't take shit from nobody.
- Oh, yeah.

01:34:36.207 --> 01:34:38.280
You used to take shit
from everybody, though.

01:34:38.448 --> 01:34:39.882
Remember that?

01:34:40.049 --> 01:34:43.244
But you were great in this one.
That was fun.

01:34:52.486 --> 01:34:55.285
What were the combined findings
of the hospital staff?

01:34:56.486 --> 01:34:59.720
The staff did find Charles Fineman
victim to severe symptoms...

01:35:00.007 --> 01:35:02.079
....of post-traumatic stress disorder...

01:35:02.247 --> 01:35:05.318
....as well as delusional tendencies
related to that...

01:35:05.488 --> 01:35:07.444
....and an incapability to function...

01:35:07.608 --> 01:35:09.836
....in anything resembling
a normal adult manner.

01:35:10.005 --> 01:35:14.205
And do you think remanding him
to the hospital for up to a year...

01:35:14.367 --> 01:35:15.720
....would benefit Dr. Fineman?

01:35:16.725 --> 01:35:17.922
Yes, I do.

01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:21.646
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Dr. Bale.

01:35:21.807 --> 01:35:23.238
You may step down.

01:35:23.405 --> 01:35:26.480
I disagree strongly with that finding.

01:35:27.086 --> 01:35:31.797
Your Honour, I think that Charlie
needs to find his own way.

01:35:31.966 --> 01:35:34.400
Not on our time,
but on Charlie's time.

01:35:34.684 --> 01:35:36.675
And I think that will happen.

01:35:36.844 --> 01:35:39.279
He'll find people
that will fill his life again.

01:35:39.446 --> 01:35:42.358
Not today, but soon. Slowly.

01:35:43.402 --> 01:35:44.805
Can I just ask a question...

01:35:44.965 --> 01:35:48.355
....about your life experience
in regard to this long-term illness?

01:35:49.604 --> 01:35:51.086
I'm curious. How old are you?

01:35:52.045 --> 01:35:53.763
What does that have to do
with anything?

01:35:53.925 --> 01:35:55.994
- Dr. Fineman...
- That question sucks, Your Honour.

01:35:56.164 --> 01:35:59.440
- It's actually a good question.
- No, no, no, it sucks. It sucks.

01:35:59.606 --> 01:36:01.801
You know,
we're gonna talk about age.

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:03.876
He's gotta go to
Little League practise soon.

01:36:04.726 --> 01:36:06.682
Dr. Fineman.

01:36:07.244 --> 01:36:10.760
Mr. Fallon, the question's specious.
It demeans the court.

01:36:11.445 --> 01:36:14.641
You don't need to address it,
Dr. Oakhurst.

01:36:14.803 --> 01:36:18.432
He wouldn't talk about them
from that day on, any of them.

01:36:19.564 --> 01:36:22.317
Then he cut us off.
He wouldn't take my calls.

01:36:22.484 --> 01:36:24.840
He wouldn't take our calls.

01:36:25.643 --> 01:36:29.159
You know, this has destroyed
my wife a second time...

01:36:29.481 --> 01:36:31.394
....what's happening here
with Charlie.

01:36:32.044 --> 01:36:33.717
She couldn't even
take the stand today.

01:36:34.284 --> 01:36:36.954
This has been awfully hard on her.

01:36:37.363 --> 01:36:41.151
Tell me about what happened
the last time Charlie was over.

01:36:41.323 --> 01:36:44.873
We wanted to show him some
pictures of the girls, some photos.

01:36:45.044 --> 01:36:49.321
It was very, very hard.
We wanted to give them to him.

01:36:49.482 --> 01:36:51.554
And what happened
when you showed him the photos?

01:36:51.922 --> 01:36:54.914
Charlie broke a beautiful lamp
of Ginger's.

01:36:55.082 --> 01:36:58.119
It was one of a set. We gave
the other to our daughter. It was...

01:36:58.284 --> 01:37:01.159
How long are we gonna
talk about this lamp? Goddamn it.

01:37:01.321 --> 01:37:03.630
It was a lamp. Let it go already.

01:37:03.799 --> 01:37:05.838
- It's more than a lamp, Charlie.
- Oh, come on.

01:37:06.001 --> 01:37:08.357
It was a hell of a lot
more than a lamp.

01:37:08.521 --> 01:37:11.798
- Just stop it already. Just stop it.
- Okay, okay. Enough.

01:37:12.761 --> 01:37:15.514
That's one. Both of you...

01:37:15.682 --> 01:37:17.271
....that's one.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.478
Mrs. Timpleman, sit down.

01:37:18.641 --> 01:37:21.314
He knows damn well
what that fricking lamp meant to me.

01:37:21.481 --> 01:37:23.390
Sit down.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.722
Go on.

01:37:31.882 --> 01:37:35.555
Do you carry any pictures
of your grandchildren, Jonathan?

01:37:35.721 --> 01:37:37.118
In my wallet, yes,
of course I do.

01:37:37.278 --> 01:37:39.033
Of course he does.
What is he, an animal?

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.715
Oh, ma'am, please stop.

01:37:49.279 --> 01:37:53.160
Are these photographs copies...

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.635
....of the same photographs
that you carry with you every day?

01:37:56.797 --> 01:37:58.119
Yes.

01:37:58.279 --> 01:38:00.269
And what was
this little angel's name?

01:38:02.281 --> 01:38:03.711
This is Gina.

01:38:03.878 --> 01:38:06.758
She was 5. She was a little doll.

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.714
And this is little Jenny.

01:38:11.238 --> 01:38:13.150
She was quite a little chess player.

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.831
She got that from me.

01:38:15.959 --> 01:38:19.156
Jenny wanted to join a tournament,
so I signed her up and we went.

01:38:21.278 --> 01:38:22.267
And that photograph...

01:38:22.439 --> 01:38:24.793
....that's you and her
at a chess tournament together?

01:38:24.958 --> 01:38:26.311
Yes.

01:38:29.278 --> 01:38:32.872
- And this?
- This is all of us at the Cape.

01:38:35.116 --> 01:38:36.436
And this photograph.

01:38:36.598 --> 01:38:39.395
- This is your daughter Doreen here?
- Yes.

01:38:44.477 --> 01:38:46.354
And this photograph...

01:38:47.479 --> 01:38:49.707
....this is all four of them?

01:38:49.878 --> 01:38:51.196
Yes.

01:38:51.356 --> 01:38:53.190
All four of them.

01:38:57.716 --> 01:38:59.832
Dr. Fineman.

01:39:01.198 --> 01:39:04.029
Dr. Fineman. That's two.

01:39:07.877 --> 01:39:09.786
I bet you miss them.

01:39:09.956 --> 01:39:13.950
I think about them all day.
Every day of my life.

01:39:14.516 --> 01:39:16.632
I don't understand
how anyone could not.

01:39:18.074 --> 01:39:19.144
Dr. Fineman.

01:39:19.515 --> 01:39:21.153
I have no further questions,
Your Honour.

01:39:27.755 --> 01:39:30.747
- Your Honour, you gonna allow this?
- That's three.

01:39:31.315 --> 01:39:32.352
Bailiff.

01:39:32.515 --> 01:39:34.586
Take him out to the hallway.

01:39:34.756 --> 01:39:36.314
Just let the guy...

01:39:36.475 --> 01:39:39.037
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Hey, come on.

01:39:39.194 --> 01:39:40.390
Hey, take it easy.

01:39:40.555 --> 01:39:42.545
Take it easy with him.

01:39:44.273 --> 01:39:45.948
I'm right here, Charlie.

01:39:46.115 --> 01:39:49.266
Charlie, I'm right here.
Charlie, I'm right here.

01:39:52.034 --> 01:39:53.945
Clear the court.

01:39:56.074 --> 01:39:58.908
I wanna see counsel for both sides
and the Timplemans...

01:39:59.075 --> 01:40:02.031
....in my chambers in 20 minutes.

01:40:07.154 --> 01:40:09.508
This is a mess.

01:40:10.394 --> 01:40:14.865
First off, you ever pull crap like that
in my court again...

01:40:15.034 --> 01:40:18.183
....I will have hardened inmates
using you as a dress-up doll.

01:40:18.352 --> 01:40:19.945
- Hear me?
- Your Honour, in my defence...

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:21.467
Quiet.

01:40:24.911 --> 01:40:26.825
You know something?

01:40:27.713 --> 01:40:30.351
The more I think about
this damn case...

01:40:31.231 --> 01:40:33.542
....the more I realise
that this is a family matter.

01:40:33.713 --> 01:40:37.261
This is not something that
the state should be deciding upon.

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:39.549
- Your Honour...
- Shut up.

01:40:44.831 --> 01:40:46.582
I'm serious.

01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:50.222
I want you to shut up, Mr. Fallon.

01:40:50.391 --> 01:40:53.509
This is not going well for you,
you hear me?

01:40:53.672 --> 01:40:55.229
Shut up.

01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:56.585
Yes.

01:40:56.753 --> 01:40:58.023
Shut up.

01:41:02.311 --> 01:41:04.699
Mr. And Mrs. Timpleman...

01:41:06.112 --> 01:41:09.627
....this is very serious stuff
we're talking about here.

01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:11.618
I mean, it's easy to see...

01:41:11.789 --> 01:41:14.749
....that this man is going through
something very profound.

01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:18.101
It's obvious.

01:41:19.351 --> 01:41:22.023
He may need some hospitalisation.

01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:23.703
He may.

01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:26.421
On the other hand...

01:41:26.590 --> 01:41:28.821
....he might just need
to find his own way.

01:41:31.388 --> 01:41:32.983
The fact is...

01:41:33.150 --> 01:41:34.902
....you're correct.

01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:37.625
You are the closest thing
he has to family.

01:41:38.389 --> 01:41:40.984
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:46.980
I want you to go home...

01:41:47.591 --> 01:41:50.740
....and think very hard this weekend.

01:41:51.588 --> 01:41:55.139
Because we're all gonna meet
back here on Monday morning...

01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:58.824
....and I'm going to let
the two of you decide.

01:41:59.548 --> 01:42:02.507
I want you to rack your brains.

01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:06.059
I want you to think about what
your little girl would have you do...

01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:08.105
....in this situation.

01:42:11.028 --> 01:42:13.258
And I'm gonna have you
look me straight in the eye...

01:42:13.428 --> 01:42:15.383
....on Monday morning...

01:42:16.348 --> 01:42:17.700
....and tell me whether or not...

01:42:17.867 --> 01:42:21.303
....she would want her man
put away in a place like that.

01:42:24.547 --> 01:42:28.097
You understand what it is
that I am telling you, Mrs. Timpleman?

01:42:29.668 --> 01:42:32.578
The power that I am putting
in your hands.

01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:35.457
Yes. Yes, sir.

01:42:35.948 --> 01:42:37.858
Your Honour, can I just say something?
Let me...

01:42:38.028 --> 01:42:39.299
What is his name?

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:43.023
Bryan Sugarman. Bryan Sugarman.

01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:46.224
Monday morning.

01:42:46.385 --> 01:42:48.025
Ten-thirty.

01:42:48.746 --> 01:42:51.055
Don't bring Sugarman.

01:42:54.145 --> 01:42:56.661
Is Dr. Johnson coming out?

01:42:56.825 --> 01:42:59.737
He's inside with the judge.

01:43:02.106 --> 01:43:03.300
Can I sit down?

01:43:04.865 --> 01:43:07.380
Charlie, can Donna sit down?

01:43:07.544 --> 01:43:10.742
She really wanted to come
to your hearing today to support you.

01:43:12.024 --> 01:43:14.062
- Here?
- Yeah.

01:43:14.905 --> 01:43:16.100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:43:16.625 --> 01:43:19.139
On your side. She can sit
on your side, though. All right?

01:43:29.306 --> 01:43:32.660
I don't know how they can't see
that he's just got a broken heart.

01:43:32.822 --> 01:43:35.976
It's so broken, his poor heart.

01:43:43.264 --> 01:43:44.252
It's okay.

01:44:07.823 --> 01:44:11.179
I don't need to talk about her
or look at pictures...

01:44:11.342 --> 01:44:14.699
....because the truth is,
a lot of times, I see her...

01:44:14.863 --> 01:44:16.773
....on the street.

01:44:17.742 --> 01:44:21.655
I walk down the street,
I see her in someone else's face...

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:24.814
....clearer than any of the pictures
you carry with you.

01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:27.899
I get that you're in pain.

01:44:28.062 --> 01:44:30.416
But you got each other.

01:44:31.181 --> 01:44:33.136
You got each other...

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:36.500
....and I'm the one who's gotta
see her and the girls all the time.

01:44:36.661 --> 01:44:39.049
Everywhere I go.

01:44:41.661 --> 01:44:43.698
I even see the dog.

01:44:44.662 --> 01:44:47.302
That's how fucked up I still am.

01:44:47.463 --> 01:44:50.897
I look at a German shepherd,
I see our goddamn poodle.

01:44:56.622 --> 01:44:58.133
All right.

01:45:03.181 --> 01:45:04.694
All right.

01:45:42.139 --> 01:45:43.254
What is this?

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:47.090
He's gone.
The movers finished up an hour ago.

01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:49.772
Didn't even leave a forwarding.

01:45:52.299 --> 01:45:54.332
He just left this.

01:45:55.097 --> 01:45:58.089
He said that this
was to be for you, Ginger.

01:46:05.698 --> 01:46:08.165
Listen, I know
you've both been through hell...

01:46:08.338 --> 01:46:11.373
....but shouldn't you
just leave him alone?

01:46:12.736 --> 01:46:14.374
We just wanna be part of his life.

01:46:14.536 --> 01:46:17.415
No, I know. I understand,
but it's not an option right now.

01:46:20.256 --> 01:46:22.007
Monday morning,
you need to go in there...

01:46:22.177 --> 01:46:24.372
....and just call off the dogs.

01:46:39.614 --> 01:46:41.127
Okay.

01:46:43.296 --> 01:46:44.933
You take care, Adell.

01:46:45.097 --> 01:46:47.972
Thank you for taking care of Charlie.

01:46:48.136 --> 01:46:49.615
Thanks.

01:46:54.414 --> 01:46:57.055
- When did he redo the kitchen?
- Oh, God, the kitchen.

01:46:57.216 --> 01:47:00.011
Sixteen thousand times
he did the kitchen.

01:47:00.895 --> 01:47:02.805
It's beautiful.

01:47:03.776 --> 01:47:06.970
The girls would love the colour.
They would love this look.

01:47:10.055 --> 01:47:12.205
It's a kitchen, sweetie.

01:47:12.775 --> 01:47:14.253
Come on.

01:47:34.972 --> 01:47:37.124
Can you sign off for me?

01:47:41.573 --> 01:47:42.562
- Hey.
- Thanks.

01:47:42.733 --> 01:47:45.884
This is the last of it. I got a pizza
coming. Could you just send it up?

01:47:46.611 --> 01:47:48.569
Yeah, yeah, we'll send it up.

01:48:02.172 --> 01:48:03.845
You're up.

01:48:04.852 --> 01:48:05.842
Wanna go?

01:48:06.012 --> 01:48:08.002
No, no, no. I gotta...

01:48:08.812 --> 01:48:10.848
....get back to your spot
and get my car.

01:48:11.012 --> 01:48:13.524
I'll come and hang out with you
tomorrow for lunch.

01:48:22.611 --> 01:48:25.569
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

01:48:29.772 --> 01:48:33.365
- Anyone order pizza?
- This is the place. Here, I'll take it.

01:48:33.529 --> 01:48:35.202
Come on in.

01:48:37.411 --> 01:48:38.730
Come on in.

01:48:40.128 --> 01:48:42.247
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah, I think it's okay.

01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:48.599
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:48:50.850 --> 01:48:52.442
Hey, Charlie...

01:48:53.648 --> 01:48:57.121
....you don't mind if Donna stays
and has some pizza, right?

01:48:59.689 --> 01:49:02.410
Oh, yeah, she can stay.

01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:07.443
- There's some plates in the kitchen.
- Thank you, Dr. Johnson.

01:49:07.848 --> 01:49:09.282
For everything.

01:49:13.009 --> 01:49:13.995
Okay.

01:49:22.728 --> 01:49:26.005
I'm gonna take off and I'll catch you
tomorrow, all right, buddy?

01:49:26.169 --> 01:49:27.725
All right, go ahead. You're up.

01:49:27.887 --> 01:49:30.800
- I'm up? I told you, I gotta go...
- You said you wanted to go again.

01:49:30.968 --> 01:49:33.435
I thought you said that.
Don't you wanna go?

01:49:33.607 --> 01:49:36.167
You said you wanted to
take another shot and stick around.

01:49:36.327 --> 01:49:37.761
Yep, that's what I said.

01:49:54.406 --> 01:49:56.159
"Shadows of the Colossus."

01:50:30.886 --> 01:50:33.639
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:50:33.804 --> 01:50:36.317
Where are you?
Did you pick the girls up yet?

01:50:36.484 --> 01:50:38.078
Going right now.

01:50:38.726 --> 01:50:39.918
What are you doing?

01:50:40.085 --> 01:50:41.995
What do you think I'm doing?
Cooking dinner.

01:50:45.885 --> 01:50:48.522
Janeane, I gotta tell you
something, babe.

01:50:50.604 --> 01:50:54.722
I don't know how I got to the place
where I'm not letting you in...

01:50:54.883 --> 01:50:57.193
....but you're right, I'm not.

01:50:57.365 --> 01:50:59.434
And that's wrong.
I gotta open up to you.

01:51:00.124 --> 01:51:02.078
Because I don't wanna be
that guy, baby.

01:51:02.243 --> 01:51:04.632
I don't wanna be that guy.

01:51:05.883 --> 01:51:09.352
I don't know if anything I said
even makes any sense, but...

01:51:19.043 --> 01:51:20.795
Alan, just come home. I love you.

01:51:20.961 --> 01:51:23.524
I know I probably don't
tell you that enough, but I do.

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:26.399
I love you.

01:51:26.883 --> 01:51:29.521
Can you just pick the girls up
and come home?

01:51:31.123 --> 01:51:33.114
I love you too.

01:51:33.284 --> 01:51:35.920
I'll be home in a minute, okay?

01:51:39.242 --> 01:51:40.881
You guys left this.

01:51:41.043 --> 01:51:43.762
Don't leave stuff laying around.
I mean it.

01:51:44.402 --> 01:51:48.077
Hey. No, no, no, Kemp.
Take this back upstairs. Kemp.

01:52:25.506 --> 01:52:37.690
THE END
