00:23.323 --> 00:26.190
Dwayne, don't yank my chain.

00:26.259 --> 00:28.955
Look, I told you.
I haven't seen him.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.580
He's your cousin.
He's your best friend.

00:30.615 --> 00:31.765
Yeah, and I don't know where he is.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.462
- Dwayne, do I look like an idiot to you?
- Yeah, you sorta do.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.095
Oh, that's a mistake.
You don't want to make him angry.

00:38.171 --> 00:40.867
Uh, I made him angry once.
You don't want to do that. - Dwayne...

00:57.223 --> 00:59.817
Hey! Cop. Kiss my ass!

01:03.396 --> 01:05.830
Don't move.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.395
- Can I be honest with you, sir?
- All units, clear the air.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.201
We're in pursuit of a hit-and-run.
He's eastbound on Union.

01:14.274 --> 01:17.004
This is my first car chase.
I been waitin' for this my whole life.

01:25.452 --> 01:29.218
Chase over.
What'd you think?

01:31.724 --> 01:34.524
MONK Season 2 Epi. 07
Mr. Monk and the Sleeping Suspect

02:30.383 --> 02:33.784
Okay, how about
an automatic card shuffler?

02:33.853 --> 02:35.878
Says "Fun for all ages."

02:35.955 --> 02:37.923
I know he enjoys having fun.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.152
He mentioned that once.

02:40.226 --> 02:43.286
Adrian, I can see that you're anxious
about this, but...

02:43.363 --> 02:46.696
the important thing to remember
is that Benjy loves you,

02:46.766 --> 02:50.634
so whatever you get for him,
Benjy will love.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.137
He didn't love the pajamas
I bought him last year.

02:53.206 --> 02:57.836
I saw it on his face.
The... The disappointment.

02:57.911 --> 03:02.245
L-I hate that look. L-I never
want to see that look again.

03:02.315 --> 03:07.082
Adrian, why don't you just
ask Sharona what he would like?

03:07.153 --> 03:12.580
She said to pick out the gift myself,
so it would really come from me.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.496
Okay. I'm sorry, but, uh...

03:17.564 --> 03:22.200
- our time is up.
- Okay, well...I'll see ya Thursday.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.533
No! No, uh, don't you remember?

03:25.605 --> 03:28.233
- I'll be in Costa Rica.
- Costa Rica?

03:28.308 --> 03:31.243
Yeah. For three weeks.
It's my vacation.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.245
I've never been to Costa Rica.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.941
Uh, no, Adrian. You're not coming.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.415
It's a vacation. But if-if you like,

03:38.484 --> 03:40.714
I can refer you to
another doctor. - Uh...

03:40.787 --> 03:43.620
- O-Or not! Or not.
- Why didn't you tell me?

03:43.690 --> 03:46.960
I did. I told you every week
for the past month,

03:46.995 --> 03:50.157
but I guess you just, um,
blocked it out.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.363
Is that possible? - Apparently.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.661
I guess I did. I blocked it out.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.228
No problem.
We'll talk about it on Thursday.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.954
Carrie, come on.
You can't believe a word my brother says.

04:26.032 --> 04:27.413
I was there.

04:27.448 --> 04:30.867
My father was not in his right mind
when he wrote that second will.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.599
If he wrote it at all.
Well, you know what?

04:33.673 --> 04:36.608
If the judge wants to rule against us,
I'll guess we'll just have to appeal.

04:37.644 --> 04:41.273
Hmm. Bay Bridge Books?
I don't remember ordering this.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.679
Yeah, well, you know what?
It's been two years.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.310
I'll probably die
before I see a dime.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.022
Listen, Carrie, I gotta go.
I gotta unpack.

04:49.057 --> 04:52.335
I've been here six weeks,
and my stuff is still in boxes. Bye.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.955
Sigmund Freud never took a vacation.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.967
Well, Sigmund Freud never met you.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.128
I need somebody to talk to.

05:04.203 --> 05:07.195
He'll be back soon.
Don't worry about it.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.434
I mean, everybody
needs some time off.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.977
Except, apparently me.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.863
Why don't you try a different
doctor for a few weeks?

05:13.898 --> 05:17.242
No. No, no, no. It takes me eight
months to break in a new therapist.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.376
Most of them don't make it.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.579
Two took an early retirement.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.885
Did you get a present for Benjy yet? - No.

05:24.957 --> 05:28.688
Well, you don't have that much time.
His birthday's tomorrow.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.025
- I don't know if I can make it.
- You better make it.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.122
You promised him.
He really wants you at his party.

05:33.199 --> 05:36.168
Why? - Because he's very young.

05:36.235 --> 05:38.703
His father better send him
something. That's all I can say.

05:38.771 --> 05:42.104
Lieutenant. - Sharona, Monk.

05:42.175 --> 05:46.407
- Is that a new tie?
- Yeah. It's a gift from my girlfriend.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.448
She has very good taste.
In ties, not in men.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.413
Ooh, do I detect a hint of jealousy?

05:51.448 --> 05:54.282
If you do, it's the only detecting
you've ever done.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.517
Adrian Monk,
old buddy, old pal, old chum.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.457
"Old buddy"? What have you done
with the real Captain Stottlemeyer?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.830
What do we have? - Mail bomb.

06:03.865 --> 06:07.061
An ounce and a half of plastique
with a magnesium charge.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.330
There were two triggers: A chemical
detonator wired to the wrapping,

06:10.403 --> 06:13.133
and a motion detector... so when
you opened it and moved it, boom!

06:13.206 --> 06:16.539
- Not hard to make.
- Crude and unpredictable, actually.

06:16.609 --> 06:19.840
- Who's the victim?
- Amanda Babbage, 35 years old.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.278
- She lived here alone.
- Nice house.

06:22.348 --> 06:25.249
- It was a lot nicer two hours ago.
- The feds are here?

06:25.318 --> 06:29.220
Yes, up the wazoo. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

06:29.288 --> 06:32.780
They're in charge, and
they're not shy about saying so.

06:32.859 --> 06:35.919
Monk. If you can make me
look good here,

06:35.995 --> 06:38.486
I would really appreciate it.

06:38.564 --> 06:42.056
I'd love to show these bastards up.
Wouldn't hurt our careers either.

06:56.382 --> 07:01.251
Excuse me!
Excuse me, excuse me!

07:01.320 --> 07:04.084
Can you please keep it down?

07:04.157 --> 07:06.148
We're trying to think.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.129
Go in the other room.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.074
Who the hell is that?
Marion the Librarian?

07:26.145 --> 07:28.340
It's Adrian Monk.
He's consulting with us.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.348
But he's not consulting with us.

07:30.416 --> 07:34.216
Agent Grooms, you said you'd keep
us local bumpkins in the loop.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.380
Give my man
a couple of minutes, okay?

07:40.726 --> 07:43.354
- What is it?
- A knot.

07:43.429 --> 07:46.557
I've never seen one tied
quite like that, have you?

07:46.632 --> 07:48.566
No, I can't say that I have.

07:49.869 --> 07:54.135
- "Street"?
- Yeah. That's part of the address.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.540
Well, but this is McCallister Avenue,
not Street.

07:57.610 --> 08:01.307
- Part of the return address.
- Return address is here.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.913
The bomb was addressed incorrectly.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.035
"Please forward."

08:32.111 --> 08:34.272
It's a change of address label.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.116
Did she just move in?

08:38.183 --> 08:41.620
That's right. She bought
the house two months ago. Thanks.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.874
Glad we could help.

08:44.909 --> 08:48.082
- We would have found it.
- Maybe.

08:48.476 --> 08:50.921
There's our boy.
Amanda's kid brother, Ricky.

08:50.956 --> 08:53.489
Estate's been in probate
since the old man died.

08:53.566 --> 08:57.525
Amanda and her two brothers have been
fighting over the estate ever since.

08:57.603 --> 09:00.367
Too much money, and too many lawyers.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.498
Do you want me to talk to him?

09:02.575 --> 09:05.135
No, thank you, Captain.
I think we can handle it.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.243
Okay. I'll just watch and take notes.
I'm so keen to learn.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.777
That's my sister's house.
What's your badge number, huh?

09:14.812 --> 09:16.247
That's my sister in there!

09:16.322 --> 09:18.790
I'm family, eh?
Do you understand?

09:18.858 --> 09:21.156
All right. I got it. I got it.
Richard Babbage?

09:21.227 --> 09:25.664
Are you in charge? Thank God,
because this storm trooper...

09:25.731 --> 09:27.699
wouldn't let me through.
I'm Agent Grooms.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.702
I'm with the A. T. F. Ricky,
I know this is a bad time for you.

09:30.770 --> 09:34.206
I need to ask you a few questions.
When was the last time you saw your sister?

09:34.273 --> 09:37.333
I don't know. There was a barbecue
here about two weeks ago.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.174
We had a fight.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.704
I said some things.
I can't believe this has hap...

09:43.783 --> 09:47.116
- Excuse me. Is this your surfboard?
- Yes.

09:47.186 --> 09:51.714
- Did you... put it up here? - Yes. I
didn't want it to tear up the back seat,

09:51.791 --> 09:55.352
so I tied it up there.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.556
- Who is he?
- Nobody. Captain?

09:58.631 --> 10:01.156
I need to ask Ricky a few questions.
Why don't you stay here with "Marion,"

10:01.233 --> 10:03.793
and uh... guard the car.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.730
Okeydokey.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.176
Who's "Marion"? - You are.

10:12.244 --> 10:15.372
- "Marion the Librarian."
- So it's like a put-down.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.906
Yup. It's a derogatory remark, Monk.
What do you see?

10:18.985 --> 10:22.148
Oh, he's not the guy. He definitely
knew his sister lived here.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.155
He was at a barbecue here
two weeks ago.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.919
But the package was mailed
to the old address. - Right.

10:26.993 --> 10:30.520
And he said he tied the surfboard
to the roof himself.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.655
Look at these knots.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.327
They're a mess. Crude, tangled.

10:36.402 --> 10:40.361
But the knot we saw inside,
on the bomb, was a work of art.

10:40.439 --> 10:42.873
- So the feds...
- Are barking up the wrong tree.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.240
You said there was
another brother? - Yeah. Brian.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.644
- But he's a dead end.
- Or practically dead.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.909
- What do you mean?
- The guy's in a coma.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.110
We saw it happen.
Four months ago,

10:53.185 --> 10:55.153
he got T-boned by a pickup truck.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.246
Cracked his skull.
It was really unnecessary.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.224
The guy just baited me and Randy
and-and stepped on the gas.

11:00.292 --> 11:02.522
- It was my first car chase.
- That didn't count.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.325
The guy didn't go half a block.
You didn't get the car in gear.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.866
- It counted.
- It wasn't a chase, Randy.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.867
We ran to the car.

11:09.935 --> 11:12.904
Anyway, uh...
Four months ago.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.600
So he wouldn't have known
that his sister had moved.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.736
- It counted.
- I'd like to meet him.

11:22.148 --> 11:26.084
They say that people in a coma
can hear everything.

11:26.152 --> 11:29.087
- Why were you chasing him?
- Because he was running.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.215
If he ever wakes up,
we'll be sure to ask him.

11:32.291 --> 11:36.091
- What are you doing?
- Uh, I'm just makin' sure.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.225
Oh. Pen.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.800
Wait. I think I feel it.
Oh, my God. It's leaking.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.137
What are you doing?
Get your hands out of there.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.507
Uh... I-I, uh... I dropped...

11:52.578 --> 11:55.741
I dropped something...I got it.

11:56.749 --> 12:00.412
I'm Mr. Babbage's private nurse.
Are you people family?

12:00.486 --> 12:04.183
Even for family, there's no excuse.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.157
San Francisco Homicide, ma'am.
We're here on official business.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.956
Was that about the sister?
I heard it on the radio.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.654
Nurse... Nurse Stempel,

12:12.689 --> 12:15.763
is there any way Mr. Babbage
could have left this room?

12:15.835 --> 12:19.271
Not unless he was carried out.
This is a stage nine coma.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.802
His cognitive response is near zero.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.165
Has he had a lot of visitors? - Just one.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.606
His brother Ricky came by
to serve him with a subpoena.

12:26.641 --> 12:28.373
Can you believe it?

12:28.447 --> 12:31.109
- Like The Addams Family.
- And, uh...

12:31.183 --> 12:34.016
Are those the patient's shoes?

12:34.086 --> 12:37.817
- You-You didn't untie them.
- They were yanked off in the E. R.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.051
Is there anything else?
I need to change the sheets.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.720
No, ma'am.
We'll be leaving.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.896
So, you'll all be leaving? - Yes.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.622
- Yes. Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.600
Private nurse, private room.

12:49.668 --> 12:52.296
This guy knows how to take a nap.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.533
- He's the guy.
- Who's the guy?

13:00.279 --> 13:04.375
Him? Monk, he's a vegetable.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.044
He's not even a vegetable.
He hopes one day to be a vegetable.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.384
Captain, listen. His sister
moved two months ago.

13:10.456 --> 13:15.359
He is the only man in the world with a
motive who wouldn't have known that.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.418
Also, look.

13:19.865 --> 13:22.026
Look at the knot.
It's elegant.

13:22.101 --> 13:25.002
In my life, I've only seen
one other knot like that.

13:25.070 --> 13:28.767
- Yeah, the bomb.
- He's the guy.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.367
Yeah, but Monk,
he's been asleep since May.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.776
I know. - The bomb was
mailed three days ago.

13:34.847 --> 13:38.339
- There's a postmark.
- I don't know how he did it.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.351
But he did it.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.083
I've heard about sibling rivalry, Ricky.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.997
But this is ridiculous.

13:50.032 --> 13:53.029
I mean, you spend more
time in court than me.

13:53.098 --> 13:56.431
My father changed his will
every three weeks.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.800
We're just tryin' to figure out
who gets what.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.101
It's family. It's complicated.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.543
- That's a nice cigar.
- Cohiba Robustos.

14:08.614 --> 14:11.811
You want one? I got
a friend down in Key West.

14:11.884 --> 14:15.320
- He sends me a box every month.
- No, thank you.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.480
You've never worked a day
in your life, have you, Ricky?

14:17.556 --> 14:22.158
I tried working once. I hated it.

14:24.956 --> 14:26.560
Look, I-I can't help if I'm lucky.

14:26.632 --> 14:30.363
I think your luck's run out, Rick.
Goin' down.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.643
I didn't do anything.

14:32.678 --> 14:34.764
Just couldn't settle for your
third of the pie, could you?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.536
- You had to have it all.
- Hey, I was ready to settle.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.602
You ask my lawyer. My brother Brian
was the one who wasn't happy.

14:40.679 --> 14:44.240
Oh, that's classy. Blaming
your brother who's in a coma.

14:44.316 --> 14:47.945
Hey, Ricky.

14:48.020 --> 14:51.615
I got a sister.
We fight all the time.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.988
There's times when I feel like
I'd like to kill her.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.152
Have you ever felt like that?

14:58.163 --> 15:01.724
I don't know.
I've never met your sister.

15:06.038 --> 15:09.940
Captain, why don't
you go grab some coffee?

15:11.343 --> 15:14.039
I want to talk to Ricky alone.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.281
I just got kicked out of
my own interrogation room.

15:22.354 --> 15:23.473
You want some coffee, sir?

15:23.508 --> 15:27.656
No, Randy. What I want is for
that ATF creep to eat crow.

15:29.161 --> 15:32.255
Well, we know who did it and we
know why. We just don't know how.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.129
Monk, again, he's in a coma.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.281
He's the guy.

15:36.316 --> 15:39.603
In 20 seconds, Agent Grooms is
gonna come walking through that door,

15:39.672 --> 15:43.472
and he's gonna ask me what I think. Give
me something else, for the love of God.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.635
Okay, wait. I have an idea.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.059
Maybe he had an accomplice.

15:47.094 --> 15:49.511
Yes. Somebody else mailed
the damn thing. Why not?

15:49.581 --> 15:51.811
I already had that idea. Tell him.

15:52.918 --> 15:55.512
There was no accomplice.
Why would Brian Babbage hire one?

15:55.587 --> 15:57.512
He didn't know
he was gonna be in a coma.

15:57.547 --> 15:59.353
It's not exactly something you can plan.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.758
All right. Anyway. Why would an
accomplice bother to go through with it?

16:02.828 --> 16:05.194
There was no reason to. The guy
who hired him was in a coma.

16:05.264 --> 16:08.722
All right, so, Brian built the bomb.

16:08.801 --> 16:13.670
And then, Brian mailed the bomb.
By himself. - That's right.

16:13.739 --> 16:17.903
- While he was in a coma. - You
gotta admit. It's a pretty good alibi.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.872
- It's rock-solid.
- Monk, I have known...

16:19.907 --> 16:22.470
15,000 criminals in my lifetime.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.711
Here's what they all have in common:
They're conscious!

16:25.784 --> 16:28.981
- Nonetheless.
- Is your shrink coming back soon?

16:29.054 --> 16:32.217
Captain.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.919
Sorry about in there, I, uh,
work better one on one - All right.

16:40.199 --> 16:43.600
- So, how's it look?
- He's bending, but not breaking.

16:43.669 --> 16:47.002
I'll get him. About to
write up my case report, uh,

16:47.072 --> 16:49.336
I'm gonna list him as my primary.
I'll need you to sign off on that.

16:50.776 --> 16:55.236
Right? Be easier to get an indictment
if we're all on the same page.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.309
I'm thinking...

17:05.590 --> 17:07.582
maybe it's the other brother.

17:09.060 --> 17:13.292
Well, there's only one other brother,
and... he's in a coma.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.799
That's the one.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.463
I think, uh, I think
we should look into him.

17:20.506 --> 17:24.339
He's a vegetable, Captain.

17:24.410 --> 17:28.436
I know. - Don't you think that
eliminates him as a suspect?

17:29.648 --> 17:32.412
I mean, I'm just... curious.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.645
How do you think he did it?

17:37.689 --> 17:40.988
We're still workin' on that - Yeah.

17:42.127 --> 17:46.086
Well, good luck with that, Captain.
Uh, keep me informed.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.565
Benjy, Benjy, Benjy.
Where's Adrian?

17:51.637 --> 17:54.071
Mm, I don't know.

17:54.139 --> 17:56.869
Whoa, whoa.
Watch it.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.002
Hey, you guys. Not in the kitchen.
You want to take that out of the room?

18:01.914 --> 18:04.906
Are they gone?

18:04.983 --> 18:08.441
- No! What are you doing?
- Playing a game.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.619
What game? - It's called...

18:10.654 --> 18:14.818
It's called, "Are they gone?"
Are they gone? - - No.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.417
Then the game's not over.

18:17.463 --> 18:20.830
- It's a jigsaw puzzle.
- Is he right?

18:21.834 --> 18:25.361
How many pieces? - 700?

18:25.437 --> 18:28.429
Didn't I tell you?

18:28.507 --> 18:32.637
- But Benjy, Mr. Monk isn't a toy.
- Sure he is.

18:32.711 --> 18:35.271
Okay, next.
I know what this one is!

18:35.347 --> 18:37.679
Because it's from me.

18:37.749 --> 18:41.879
It's a rock-polishing kit.

18:46.758 --> 18:50.285
To clean rocks!
Happy Birthday.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.725
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.236
I had one when I was 12.

18:58.303 --> 19:03.172
It was so much... you know... fun.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.870
Hey! Let's use it now.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.811
I saw some great rocks out back.
Let's go get 'em!

19:08.881 --> 19:11.975
Maybe later, Mr. Monk.

19:16.922 --> 19:19.584
- There's that look.
- Oh, it's okay.

19:29.067 --> 19:33.367
- Trevor, what are you doin' here?
- My calendar says August 14.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.669
Mom, who is it? - Your father.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.403
His name is Trevor.
Trevor Howe.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.473
He just shows up after six years,
out of the blue.

19:45.551 --> 19:49.282
At the kid's birthday party.
Can you believe it?

19:49.354 --> 19:51.914
Benjy loves him, of course.

19:51.990 --> 19:55.687
L-I really appreciate you
letting me talk like this.

19:55.761 --> 19:58.889
My regular doctor's...out of town.

19:58.964 --> 20:02.593
I'm glad you could
squeeze me in.

20:03.602 --> 20:06.036
Anyway, about this Trevor guy,

20:06.104 --> 20:08.868
Sharona's so happy to see him,
I can't figure it out.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.671
He treated her so badly.
He was never faithful.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.131
He drank, he gambled.

20:13.166 --> 20:16.771
I guess I never appreciated
how lonely Sharona's been.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.445
She wants to forgive him.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.853
She wants to believe in him.

20:26.091 --> 20:29.652
Am I jealous?
Is that it, do you think?

20:29.728 --> 20:33.630
Or maybe-maybe I'm afraid...

20:33.699 --> 20:35.826
he's gonna take her away.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.701
What do you think?

20:43.976 --> 20:48.345
Or... maybe I'm...
I'm just feeling bad about...

20:48.413 --> 20:51.280
Benjy's birthday.

20:52.284 --> 20:55.048
Ah, he hated my gift. I could tell.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.288
A rock-polisher.
What was I thinking?

21:00.292 --> 21:03.261
Why couldn't I just...
buy him a regular toy?

21:05.063 --> 21:07.554
I'm so tired...

21:07.633 --> 21:10.033
being different.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.195
I'm exhausted.

21:13.338 --> 21:16.205
I'm exhausted, I...

21:16.275 --> 21:18.869
I don't have to tell you
about being exhausted.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.338
You don't know how lucky you are.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.441
Sleeping.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.478
Sleeping through it all.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.660
Not a care in the world.

21:43.402 --> 21:46.269
Take my advice.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.263
Savor these moments.

21:51.276 --> 21:54.677
Wow, this is a nice house.
Brian did pretty well.

21:54.746 --> 21:56.737
So, how are things with Trevor?

21:56.815 --> 21:59.511
Great! He's really
turned his life around.

21:59.584 --> 22:02.109
- Think so?
- What, you don't trust him?

22:03.555 --> 22:06.456
- Mm. You don't trust anybody.
- That's true.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.493
Although,
I'm hardly ever wrong.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.687
I'm telling you.
He's a different man,

22:10.762 --> 22:13.390
He's not drinking.
He's got a job.

22:13.465 --> 22:17.458
I mean, people change.
Not you, but other people.

22:17.536 --> 22:20.266
Good. I'm glad.

22:20.339 --> 22:24.639
- Can't you be happy for me?
- I am. I'm glad. This is me, being glad.

22:25.911 --> 22:29.403
I was just telling Brian
how happy Benjy seems.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.616
Brian who?

22:32.684 --> 22:35.619
Brian. Babbage.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.678
The coma guy? - Yeah.

22:37.756 --> 22:40.452
He woke up? - Nah... No.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.896
- But you were talking to him.
- He's a good listener.

22:44.963 --> 22:49.559
Oh, hi. I'm Sharona Fleming,
and this is Adrian Monk.

22:49.634 --> 22:52.296
We're helping the police investigate...
He didn't wake up, did he?

22:52.371 --> 22:56.307
- No.
- Oh! Thank God!

22:56.375 --> 22:58.366
Come on in.

23:00.245 --> 23:04.272
- Do you mind if we look around?
- Go right ahead. I'm just the maid.

23:12.257 --> 23:15.158
What is all this weird stuff?

23:26.638 --> 23:29.106
He was looking for a lawyer.

23:30.208 --> 23:33.644
That's no surprise.
He was suing his whole family.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.240
No, no, no.
These are criminal lawyers.

23:38.316 --> 23:41.911
Look at the name he circled:
"Scott Butterworth."

23:41.987 --> 23:45.946
- I know that name.
- Suspended twice. He was a hack.

23:46.024 --> 23:49.460
Brian Babbage could afford
any attorney in town.

23:49.528 --> 23:54.329
Why would... Why would anyone
want to hire a bad lawyer?

23:54.399 --> 23:56.526
Is that blood?

24:01.406 --> 24:03.806
No. It's just ketchup.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.035
Ugh.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.343
Ugh!

24:16.121 --> 24:18.783
There's something
you don't see every day.

24:18.857 --> 24:22.520
Excuse me. We noticed
the ketchup bottles.

24:22.594 --> 24:25.620
- In the closet?
- Why would he do that?

24:25.697 --> 24:27.995
We were afraid to ask.

24:28.066 --> 24:30.557
Mr. Babbage hates questions.

24:30.635 --> 24:34.196
- What are you doing?
- I always open the mail, to pay the bills.

24:34.272 --> 24:36.137
- Oh, my God!
- Don't open that!

24:36.208 --> 24:39.735
Hey!

24:47.419 --> 24:50.149
Okay. They pieced together enough
of the package to get a postmark.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.588
It was mailed from Pacific Heights,
two days ago.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.818
Different post office,
same type of explosive.

24:54.893 --> 24:58.522
Well, don't use that bathroom!
It's a mess!

24:58.597 --> 25:01.862
- You don't have to shout!
- Why are you whispering?

25:02.868 --> 25:06.827
Residual auditory trauma from the blast.
It'll clear up in a few hours.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.838
Monk. Monk, can you hear me?

25:08.873 --> 25:10.534
Do you have any idea
who might have done it?

25:10.609 --> 25:12.247
Brian Babbage!

25:12.282 --> 25:14.697
No! The bomb was mailed
to Brian Babbage.

25:14.732 --> 25:16.342
Somebody just tried to kill him.

25:16.414 --> 25:20.475
He sent the bomb to himself
so nobody would suspect him!

25:20.552 --> 25:23.612
- Did you see the ketchup bottles?
- Yeah, I did.

25:23.688 --> 25:27.317
Pretty weird, huh?

25:27.392 --> 25:29.417
Captain. A. T. F., 3:00.

25:30.829 --> 25:33.992
Monk, gimme somethin' else. Anything.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.090
Any theory besides the coma guy.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.465
If you were to tell me that
Howdy Doody was behind this,

25:38.537 --> 25:41.665
- it would make more sense.
- Howdy Doody?

25:41.740 --> 25:45.912
Why would Howdy Doody
be sending people mail bombs?

25:45.947 --> 25:47.112
Wasn't he a puppet?

25:47.147 --> 25:51.139
He was just using that as an example.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.083
Or maybe he was just
using that as an example!

25:54.152 --> 25:56.416
Captain!

25:57.489 --> 25:59.714
D. A. won't hold Ricky Babbage.

25:59.749 --> 26:02.085
I was hoping this might change your mind.

26:05.096 --> 26:08.361
Oh, you can't be serious. You still
think Rip Van Winkle's behind this?

26:08.433 --> 26:12.961
We believe Brian Babbage
is involved, yes. We just don't know how.

26:13.038 --> 26:16.098
And by "we," you mean,
you and your consultant.

26:16.174 --> 26:19.735
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
Howdy Doody was a puppet.

26:19.811 --> 26:22.609
How was your career, Captain?

26:23.782 --> 26:25.773
Did you enjoy it?

26:28.720 --> 26:31.120
So, do you remember me at all?

26:31.189 --> 26:34.647
I remember going camping.

26:34.726 --> 26:38.093
That's right. Yeah.
You were four years old.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.723
We went to, uh, Wisconsin Dells.

26:40.799 --> 26:42.733
And you fell off the rock.
Do you remember that?

26:42.801 --> 26:45.770
You almost scared us half to death?
Huh? I bet you still got the scar.

26:45.837 --> 26:48.169
Do you? Where is it? There it is.

26:48.239 --> 26:51.140
Wow! Well, I'll tell ya.
Wear it with pride, kid.

26:51.209 --> 26:54.736
It was a hell of a fall.
Carried you two miles.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.782
Mom says she carried me.

26:57.849 --> 27:00.010
Yeah, well, we took turns.

27:00.085 --> 27:03.384
Hey, did you get the
camera I sent you? - Yeah.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.822
Um, Mom says you never
send any checks.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.328
Yeah, well... Well, Benjy,

27:10.395 --> 27:13.091
the important thing is,
I'm here now, right?

27:14.099 --> 27:15.511
Hey, did your Mom tell you, I got a job?

27:15.546 --> 27:17.651
Managing a restaur...
Do you like hamburgers? - Yeah.

27:17.686 --> 27:20.371
Oh, good. I'll get you all
the free hamburgers you want.

27:20.438 --> 27:22.463
Oh, which reminds me of somethin'.

27:23.541 --> 27:27.637
Someone has got
some back allowance coming...

27:29.881 --> 27:32.441
A hundred dollars?

27:33.551 --> 27:37.043
- Thanks.
- Hey, Benj, listen.

27:37.122 --> 27:41.081
I screwed up, but
it's not gonna happen again.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.857
Okay? - Okay, Dad.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.988
All right. I forgot.
Which one... Which one am I?

27:47.065 --> 27:49.659
Red. Yeah. - I'm the red one.

27:49.734 --> 27:52.828
Oh.! Oh. Oh.!

27:52.904 --> 27:56.738
- You got me.
- It's okay. You have three lives.

27:56.808 --> 27:59.470
Oh, is that right?
Well, keep playin', all right?

27:59.544 --> 28:01.671
Okay, I'm gonna
talk to your mom.

28:03.281 --> 28:06.978
You hear that?
I get three lives.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.078
You're gonna need 'em.
You already used up two.

28:12.424 --> 28:15.291
You want a beer? - Uh...

28:15.360 --> 28:17.658
What, you temptin' me?

28:21.733 --> 28:25.533
- A. A. My 60-day chip.
- Two months?

28:27.806 --> 28:29.797
It's a start.

28:31.276 --> 28:35.804
Sharona, if I had three lives, I'd spend
one of them apologizing to you.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.249
- And Benjy.
- And Benjy. And Benjy.

28:40.318 --> 28:42.946
Listen. Y-You know, Monday
I start the new restaurant gig.

28:43.021 --> 28:44.955
And I was thinkin',

28:45.023 --> 28:47.787
how nice it would be if I came home every
day... and found you and Benjy there.

28:47.859 --> 28:50.885
- and found you and Benjy there.
- In New Jersey?

28:50.962 --> 28:53.863
Well, it's the Garden State.

28:53.932 --> 28:57.060
Don't-Don't say no.
Don't say no.

28:57.135 --> 28:59.330
J-Just think about it.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.896
Well, I, uh...
What about my job?

29:02.974 --> 29:05.374
I just can't leave Adrian.

29:05.443 --> 29:07.968
He's an adult.

29:08.046 --> 29:12.540
Only somebody who didn't
know him would call him that.

29:12.617 --> 29:16.144
Trust me. I'm telling you.

29:16.221 --> 29:19.884
She says she's thinking about it,
but I can tell she's gonna go.

29:19.958 --> 29:23.553
Why should she be different?
Everybody leaves me.

29:23.628 --> 29:26.222
Trudy. Dr. Kroger.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.099
And now, Sharona.
It's like the national pastime.

29:31.169 --> 29:34.070
Comments?

29:34.139 --> 29:36.903
Any questions?

30:01.766 --> 30:03.859
Is this your watch?

30:05.503 --> 30:07.835
You're two minutes fast.

30:09.574 --> 30:12.873
Just relax. I'll fix it.

30:16.047 --> 30:18.038
What's that?

30:19.951 --> 30:22.078
Is that glue?

30:23.721 --> 30:27.282
What were you gluing?

30:27.358 --> 30:29.553
Ah.! Ugh.!

30:32.764 --> 30:34.789
Uh, excuse me!

30:36.134 --> 30:38.967
Hello?
Uh, sorry?

31:18.035 --> 31:19.876
Okay!
Okay, Brian.

31:19.944 --> 31:22.435
Come on, Brian.
Come on.

31:22.513 --> 31:24.777
Come on. Come back!
Come ba... Oh, God.

31:24.849 --> 31:27.511
Aah! Come on. You can...

31:27.585 --> 31:30.486
Brian? Come on!
Come on, you and me.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.285
You and me.
You and me, all the way.

31:33.358 --> 31:36.054
Come on, almost! Almost!
Almost!

31:36.127 --> 31:38.561
That's got it! That's got it.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.224
Yeah. Ahh.

31:51.476 --> 31:53.808
He's... He's good.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.176
I mean, he's great.
I mean...

31:57.181 --> 32:00.582
He's... He's fine.
Fine now.

32:02.654 --> 32:06.613
Adrian, I'm gonna
visit you all the time.

32:06.691 --> 32:09.592
- When are you going?
- Friday.

32:09.661 --> 32:12.824
Friday? This Friday?
Just like that.

32:12.897 --> 32:15.263
- You're just leaving me in the lurch.
- You're not in the lurch.

32:15.333 --> 32:18.200
I'm in the lurch!
This is the lurch!

32:18.269 --> 32:21.932
I can feel it! - My sister's
gonna look in on you.

32:23.408 --> 32:24.415
Hey, this is the best way.

32:24.450 --> 32:25.968
If I would have given you
three weeks' notice,

32:26.044 --> 32:28.808
you and I both know that
you would have gone crazy.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.871
You know it!

32:35.320 --> 32:37.948
Oh, God, Adrian!

32:41.159 --> 32:43.559
I'm sorry.

32:45.196 --> 32:47.221
Look, this isn't about me.
It's about Benjy.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.823
He needs his father.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.461
If this doesn't work out,
I'll come back.

32:51.496 --> 32:55.128
What if it does work out?
What if you're happy? - Isn't that good?

32:55.206 --> 32:59.336
I mean... I mean, didn't you...
ever think that... someday I might leave?

32:59.410 --> 33:03.574
No. No, I wa... I was afraid to.

33:04.716 --> 33:06.650
I'm sorry. - Mr. Monk.!

33:06.718 --> 33:12.247
Sharona! Sorry I'm late.
I stopped off to visit a lady friend.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.689
Then I stopped off to visit her sister.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.785
Look, my lawyer said that
you guys were very helpful.

33:17.862 --> 33:22.299
And it's greatly appreciated.
What happened at the hospital?

33:23.301 --> 33:25.735
Heard you pulled the plug
on my brother. - I'm sorry.

33:25.803 --> 33:28.601
That was an accident.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.506
Don't apologize. I just got off
the phone with his doctor.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.669
It turns out,
you did the bastard a favor.

33:33.745 --> 33:37.511
It, uh... jump-started his
neutrons or something?

33:37.582 --> 33:41.143
Anyway, he's breathin' on his own
for the first time in months.

33:41.219 --> 33:44.950
- All thanks to you.
- Well, good. Glad to have helped.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.151
Be it ever so humble,
make yourselves at home.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.218
Geez, look at all this mail.

33:53.231 --> 33:57.634
- Uh, don't open any packages.
- Yeah, thanks. I'm not an idiot.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.237
Bills... Mail.. Don't bother.

34:02.306 --> 34:04.831
Won't stick.
Peels off every four weeks.

34:07.912 --> 34:09.937
My God.

34:10.014 --> 34:13.074
Sharona. I've got it! - What?

34:13.150 --> 34:15.847
The mail bombs.
I know how he did it!

34:17.455 --> 34:20.288
What are you doing? - Relax.

34:20.358 --> 34:23.350
They're my cigars?
From my guy in Key West?

34:23.428 --> 34:25.362
Nobody knows I get these.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.728
- Does your brother know?
- Yeah. Brian knows I get these.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.893
It's a bomb! Don't open it!

34:35.606 --> 34:38.699
Oh, my God.
Do not... move.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.809
It's okay. It's okay.

34:43.880 --> 34:47.442
Just don't move.
It is now motion-sensitive.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.452
Don't move. It's okay.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.284
It's okay. It's okay.

34:52.356 --> 34:55.449
Stop saying "okay"
and do something!

34:55.525 --> 34:58.984
Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm talking
to the bomb squad.

34:59.063 --> 35:02.897
- And they're on their way. - There
are no wire cutters in this cabinet.

35:02.967 --> 35:05.128
They're right there in the tin bucket!

35:07.538 --> 35:10.974
Will you hurry up? I don't know
how long I could stand like this. - Shh!

35:14.545 --> 35:17.241
Okay, he wants to know
how many wires you see.

35:17.315 --> 35:21.251
- Four wires. Still want to quit?
- Four wires.

35:21.319 --> 35:23.480
You'll never have this much
fun in New Jersey.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.579
He says, cut the wire...

35:25.656 --> 35:28.853
leading from the detonator to the battery.

35:28.926 --> 35:31.986
There are two.
A blue and a red.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.031
- What is that?
- Light turned green.

35:34.098 --> 35:37.295
Light turned green. He says you
have 10 seconds. Cut one of the wires!

35:37.368 --> 35:39.632
Which one?
Either one. It doesn't matter!

35:39.704 --> 35:41.695
- Okay, blue. No, no, red.
- Oh, God!

35:41.772 --> 35:43.603
- No, red. No, blue.
- Oh, God!

35:43.674 --> 35:46.006
- Cut one! Cut the blue one!
- Five seconds!

35:46.077 --> 35:48.375
- Why blue?
- God! Well, cut the red one!

35:48.446 --> 35:49.970
- You said blue!
- Three seconds.

35:50.047 --> 35:52.641
- Adrian, cut one!
- I'll cut 'em both!

36:02.860 --> 36:05.420
You okay? - Yeah, it was just your
basic mail bomb. No big deal.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.760
So I heard you're leaving.
New Jersey.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.323
Are you gonna miss me? - Nope.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.961
Well, maybe a little.

36:13.037 --> 36:17.906
Do me a favor and call me sometime...
to remind me why I left. - I'll do that.

36:17.975 --> 36:21.395
- Can everyone see?
- Yeah, we can see it's just a mailbox.

36:21.430 --> 36:22.146
What the hell are we doing here?

36:22.181 --> 36:25.912
Well, first off I'd like to thank
United States postal worker...

36:25.983 --> 36:28.588
Tamil Swarma for
helping us out here today.

36:28.623 --> 36:33.254
We're glad to help our brothers... and
sister in the law enforcement community.

36:33.324 --> 36:35.561
We just wear a different shade
of blue, that's all.

36:35.596 --> 36:37.988
Yeah! Yeah.

36:40.932 --> 36:44.299
Brian Babbage wanted to kill
his brother and sister.

36:44.368 --> 36:47.337
He found a way to mail a bomb in May...

36:47.405 --> 36:49.669
but not have it be delivered until August.

36:49.740 --> 36:52.038
It was... quite brilliant, really.

36:52.109 --> 36:55.943
Yes, it was. Although by doing so,
he violated two federal laws,

36:56.013 --> 36:59.073
and a score of postal regulations.

37:00.251 --> 37:02.344
Go on.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.753
When I recently saw some
wallpaper peeling off a wall...

37:05.823 --> 37:10.089
it reminded me of the ketchup bottles
in Brian Babbage's closet.

37:10.161 --> 37:13.062
They were glued to the ceiling.
The glue was the key.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.595
There was no glue in the bomb.

37:14.630 --> 37:17.931
It wasn't part of the bomb. It was
part of the delivery mechanism.

37:18.002 --> 37:19.970
Exactly! - Ex...

37:20.037 --> 37:22.562
It was an experiment. A stress test.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.700
The ketchup bottles weighed
about the same as the mail bombs.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.645
He was trying to find out...

37:28.713 --> 37:31.773
how long they would stick
before they fell off.

37:31.849 --> 37:34.374
- I don't get it.
- Tamil.

37:35.486 --> 37:40.446
Four months ago, Brian Babbage
went around the city late at night.

37:40.524 --> 37:43.425
Cracked open the panel
on a couple of these mailboxes...

37:43.494 --> 37:44.444
These locks are pretty simple to pick

37:44.479 --> 37:47.055
I've talked to my supervisors,
but they don't listen.

37:47.131 --> 37:48.962
- Tamil. Tamil.
- Don't make waves, you know?

37:49.033 --> 37:51.558
Everybody just wants to
hit their 20 and get out.

37:51.636 --> 37:54.264
I can take it from here.

37:55.439 --> 37:58.931
Brian put the bombs in the mailboxes,

37:59.010 --> 38:01.535
but he didn't put them on the bottom
with the rest of the mail.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.580
He glued them to the top.

38:04.849 --> 38:08.080
You see, it's a blind spot.

38:09.086 --> 38:11.577
Nobody ever looks up there.
Why would they?

38:12.823 --> 38:15.291
Four months later,
the glue dries up,

38:15.359 --> 38:17.418
the bomb falls down,

38:17.495 --> 38:20.487
and the next day, the mailman
picks it up with the rest of the mail.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.623
It was like a time-released mail bomb.

38:22.700 --> 38:27.103
The U. S. Post Office unwittingly
became the messenger of evil.

38:27.171 --> 38:29.139
Who'd have thunk it? - Well put, Tamil.

38:29.206 --> 38:32.334
By the time they were delivered,
Brian had a perfect alibi.

38:32.410 --> 38:35.208
He put himself in a coma?
That's his alibi?

38:35.279 --> 38:38.874
That's the stupidest plan I ever heard of.
He came this close to killing himself.

38:38.949 --> 38:42.976
I was stumped too. But then
I realized, that wasn't his plan at all.

38:43.054 --> 38:46.649
- No one would plan to be in a coma.
- His idea was to get himself arrested...

38:46.724 --> 38:48.658
so he would be in jail
when the bombs were delivered.

38:48.726 --> 38:51.456
That's why he tried to lead us
on a car chase.

38:51.529 --> 38:54.054
He figured he'd be in jail
for seven or eight months.

38:54.131 --> 38:58.158
He even picked out a terrible lawyer,
to make sure that he wouldn't get off.

38:58.235 --> 39:02.069
- But he screwed up and he hit a truck.
- And a car. Then another car.

39:02.139 --> 39:04.937
Brian Babbage stumbled...
literally, by accident...

39:05.009 --> 39:07.842
into the best alibi in
the history of crime.

39:07.912 --> 39:12.110
- Look, where's your proof?
- Brian Babbage woke up this morning.

39:12.183 --> 39:15.118
I've arranged for all of us
to pay him a little visit.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.677
This is going to be great. - Not you.

39:18.823 --> 39:21.257
Mister Babbage? - Maria.

39:21.325 --> 39:24.123
Ohh! You're awake!
It's a miracle.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.595
I came as soon as I heard.

39:26.664 --> 39:28.707
Sorry about your sister and your brother.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.801
Thank you, Maria.

39:30.836 --> 39:33.497
The doctor just told me
about them. I can't...

39:33.571 --> 39:35.732
I can't believe it.

39:35.806 --> 39:38.934
I won't stay long.
I just wanted to welcome you back.

39:39.009 --> 39:41.876
And... I brought your mail.

39:41.946 --> 39:44.881
- What's-What's that?
- I'm sorry, I started to open...

39:44.949 --> 39:47.884
It's a bomb. It's a bomb!
Get down!

39:47.952 --> 39:50.011
Get down.

39:56.527 --> 40:00.725
I can't help but wonder what made
you think that was a bomb, Mr. Babbage.

40:03.334 --> 40:06.103
Brian Babbage? Good morning.

40:06.138 --> 40:09.231
You're under arrest for the murder
of your sister, Amanda.

40:09.306 --> 40:12.469
Sharona? Benjy!
The taxi's here.

40:16.947 --> 40:20.314
Ah. Come on, guys.
We're gonna miss the plane.

40:24.021 --> 40:26.489
Sharona, whatever it is, leave it.
The movers will get it tomorrow.

40:26.557 --> 40:30.254
- Wha... Where's Benjy?
- He's at my sister's.

40:30.327 --> 40:32.659
What? We gotta get goin'.

40:34.632 --> 40:36.566
- We're not goin'.
- What are you talkin' about?

40:38.302 --> 40:41.635
Found the plane tickets
last night. Detroit? - Sharona...

40:41.705 --> 40:44.333
- No. Sharona, listen.
- Christ, I shoulda known.

40:44.408 --> 40:46.740
I just thought we could stop...

40:46.811 --> 40:49.837
I just thought we could
stop on the way home...

40:49.914 --> 40:53.406
and see my Uncle Jack, that's all.
You don't want to see Uncle Jack.

40:53.484 --> 40:55.611
You want your Uncle Jack
to see me and Benjy.

40:55.686 --> 40:59.850
He cut you off after we split up, and now
you're trying to get back into his pocket.

40:59.924 --> 41:02.757
Look. The taxi's outside.
The meter's runnin'.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.818
Let's just... We'll talk on the way, okay?

41:09.767 --> 41:12.065
Sharona. Honey?

41:12.136 --> 41:15.435
The money is for bo...

41:15.506 --> 41:18.100
It's for all of us. I mean,
he's richer than God.

41:18.175 --> 41:20.109
Why not take advantage of that?

41:20.177 --> 41:23.112
That's all you're good at, Trevor.
Taking advantage.

41:25.049 --> 41:27.205
Why don't you call Benjy
and tell him that the

41:27.206 --> 41:29.315
only reason why you got
back into his life...

41:29.386 --> 41:31.616
is so that your rich uncle
doesn't cut you off.

41:35.626 --> 41:37.787
Didn't think so.

41:38.796 --> 41:42.664
- What about Benjy? He needs a father.
- Yeah, that's true. He does.

41:42.733 --> 41:45.497
So why don't you come back
when you're ready to be one?

41:45.569 --> 41:47.560
Hey...

42:10.828 --> 42:13.490
Uh, there it is.
The house on the left there?

42:23.073 --> 42:25.974
K-K-Keep going! J- Just go.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.841
Where to? - It doesn't matter.
Just go. Go. Go.

42:44.628 --> 42:47.119
Hey!

42:47.197 --> 42:49.427
Thought you might be here.
How ya doin'?

42:49.500 --> 42:53.834
I'm good. I'm great.
I'm living a dream.

42:59.910 --> 43:02.344
Where's Trevor?

43:02.413 --> 43:04.404
Went home.

43:07.685 --> 43:10.017
I'm sorry.

43:12.656 --> 43:14.817
I missed you.

43:15.826 --> 43:17.919
I missed you too.

43:20.130 --> 43:23.190
God, I really did.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.362
Maybe I should
see a shrink, too.

43:25.397 --> 43:28.994
Stick around.
Dr. Kroger will be here any minute.
