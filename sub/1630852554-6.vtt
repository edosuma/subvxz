GATES:
I'm Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.909
Welcome to "Finding Your Roots".

00:09.933 --> 00:11.342
In this episode,

00:11.366 --> 00:14.833
we'll meet actors
Terry Crews and Tony Danza,

00:15.533 --> 00:18.600
two men who battled
their way to success.

00:19.666 --> 00:21.209
DANZA: Where I lived in
East New York in Brooklyn,

00:21.233 --> 00:23.242
street fighting was
like the game we played.

00:23.266 --> 00:25.076
Like, you want to
play stickball today?

00:25.100 --> 00:26.376
No, let's fight.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.142
CREWS: You know there
was no such thing as therapy.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.476
GATES: No.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.976
CREWS: It was just, "Hey man,
you know, suck it up, move on.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.900
And we gotta
find a way to live."

00:34.533 --> 00:36.142
GATES: To uncover their roots,

00:36.166 --> 00:38.209
we've used every
tool available...

00:38.233 --> 00:40.676
Genealogists combed
through the paper trail

00:40.700 --> 00:42.542
their ancestors left behind,

00:42.566 --> 00:45.542
while DNA experts
utilized the latest advances in

00:45.566 --> 00:49.200
genetic analysis to reveal
secrets hundreds of years old.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.033
And we've compiled everything
into a book of life...

00:53.433 --> 00:54.410
CREWS: Wow!

00:54.434 --> 00:56.442
GATES: A record of
all of our discoveries...

00:56.466 --> 00:59.433
DANZA: This is all so,
you know, pins and needles.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.366
It's really it's spine-tingling.

01:02.900 --> 01:05.276
GATES: And a window
into the hidden past.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.976
CREWS: I'm jumping
with joy right now?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.476
DANZA: I marvel when
I think about it.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.666
I mean, I just marvel at the,
at the, somehow they persevered.

01:14.566 --> 01:17.542
CREWS: I had no idea.
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.

01:17.566 --> 01:20.133
This is, I had no idea.

01:21.566 --> 01:23.509
GATES: My two guests
have followed similar and

01:23.533 --> 01:26.776
equally unlikely, paths:

01:26.800 --> 01:30.409
each had troubled childhoods
then turned to sports,

01:30.433 --> 01:32.633
before finding fame
in Hollywood.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.976
Now they're going to
meet ancestors whose paths

01:37.000 --> 01:41.742
were even more improbable,
hearing stories of sacrifice,

01:41.766 --> 01:44.709
courage, and survival,

01:44.733 --> 01:48.400
all hidden in the
branches of their family trees.

02:05.366 --> 02:11.300
(theme music plays).

02:20.466 --> 02:26.000
♪ ♪

02:36.266 --> 02:39.933
GATES: Terry Crews has a story
that defies all expectations.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.466
He's a superstar actor,
pitch-man, and author...

02:45.300 --> 02:48.733
But he has absolutely no
training in any of these fields.

02:50.033 --> 02:53.242
He is entirely a
self-creation...

02:53.266 --> 02:56.933
And that self was formed in
the most unlikely of places...

02:58.966 --> 03:01.809
Terry was raised in
Flint, Michigan in a home

03:01.833 --> 03:04.300
that was marked by
intense conflict...

03:05.000 --> 03:07.666
Circumstances that would
have crushed most children.

03:08.433 --> 03:10.476
CREWS: My father was
addicted to alcohol.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.542
GATES: Uh-huh.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.009
CREWS: And my mother
was addicted to religion.

03:13.033 --> 03:14.342
GATES: Right.

03:14.366 --> 03:16.576
CREWS: Which made a very, very
caustic mix in our household.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.742
GATES: Yeah.
CREWS: I mean, there were I,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.542
I'll be honest
with you right here, I mean,

03:20.566 --> 03:22.809
I wet the
bed until I was 15 years old

03:22.833 --> 03:26.342
because I did not know what was
going to happen every night.

03:26.366 --> 03:27.542
GATES: Right.

03:27.566 --> 03:29.609
CREWS: I'd wake up to screaming,
fights, glass breaking.

03:29.633 --> 03:30.709
GATES: Oh.

03:30.733 --> 03:31.909
CREWS: And I said,

03:31.933 --> 03:33.342
"I gotta find a, a way out"

03:33.366 --> 03:35.133
and sports was gonna be my way.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.400
GATES: For Terry,
"sports" meant football,

03:39.833 --> 03:42.176
and that posed a
daunting challenge.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.709
Even the most talented
athletes stand very little

03:44.733 --> 03:47.733
chance of making it in the NFL.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.509
But Terry beat the odds.

03:51.533 --> 03:56.442
In 1991, he was drafted by
the Los Angeles Rams and went

03:56.466 --> 03:59.733
on to play for three different
teams over the next six years.

04:01.433 --> 04:04.133
Then he faced a new challenge...

04:05.133 --> 04:08.800
CREWS: When I was done
in 1997, we went broke.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.209
GATES: Right.
CREWS: Promptly went broke.

04:11.233 --> 04:14.942
And I, my attitude
of being this, this,

04:14.966 --> 04:17.476
"I am a man, I'm
a football player,"

04:17.500 --> 04:18.876
and the whole thing,
I wouldn't get a job.

04:18.900 --> 04:21.742
And finally, when things
got so rough we were digging

04:21.766 --> 04:24.409
in the couches for change,
I decided...

04:24.433 --> 04:28.300
Actually, my wife told me,
"Go get a job."

04:29.266 --> 04:31.309
And I ended up sweeping floors.

04:31.333 --> 04:32.442
And I started to sweep.

04:32.466 --> 04:33.642
I was like, "Let me
get these corners.

04:33.666 --> 04:35.076
Let me get this
a little better."

04:35.100 --> 04:36.909
And I would get $8 an hour.

04:36.933 --> 04:39.542
And I...
They gave me $64 cash.

04:39.566 --> 04:41.676
And I had to pay my
taxes right then and there.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.209
I had $48.

04:43.233 --> 04:46.642
I went home.
I gave my wife 20.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.342
I put 20 in the gas tank.

04:48.366 --> 04:51.276
And I had $8 in my hand
that I didn't have yesterday.

04:51.300 --> 04:54.200
I said, "I'll never
be broke again."

04:54.966 --> 04:57.176
GATES: Terry's
tireless work ethic,

04:57.200 --> 04:59.709
and his remarkably
positive attitude,

04:59.733 --> 05:02.276
would prove to be his salvation.

05:02.300 --> 05:05.242
Eventually, he landed a
job as a security guard on a

05:05.266 --> 05:08.133
film set where his
talents were noticed,

05:08.800 --> 05:11.109
launching a second
career that was even more

05:11.133 --> 05:13.676
improbable than his first...

05:13.700 --> 05:16.509
And now, looking back
over a life marked by

05:16.533 --> 05:18.842
titanic ups and downs,

05:18.866 --> 05:21.942
Terry not only relishes
his success but he's come to

05:21.966 --> 05:23.942
understand his parents,

05:23.966 --> 05:26.242
as well as his
troubled childhood,

05:26.266 --> 05:29.266
with what can only be
described as wisdom.

05:30.733 --> 05:31.942
CREWS: My mother was
doing the best she could with

05:31.966 --> 05:35.076
what she had,
with what she knew.

05:35.100 --> 05:39.509
Um, it-it's kind of
like a saying that we have

05:39.533 --> 05:41.142
in the entertainment industry.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.776
Like, there
really are no villains.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.076
GATES: Mm-hmm.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.342
CREWS: There are just people
trying to get what they want.

05:46.366 --> 05:47.442
You know?

05:47.466 --> 05:48.709
GATES: Yeah.

05:48.733 --> 05:50.776
CREWS: It's, it's, I-I mean,
that goes for my father too.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.876
GATES: Yeah.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.842
CREWS: He, he was doing
what he knew to do.

05:54.866 --> 05:56.042
GATES: Right.

05:56.066 --> 05:57.309
CREWS: And if...

05:57.333 --> 05:59.742
Usually, if you know better,
you do better.

05:59.766 --> 06:01.309
GATES: Because, in the end,
you have a choice.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.966
CREWS: That's it.
You have a choice.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.633
GATES: My second guest is
the beloved actor Tony Danza.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.933
A star of stage and screen
for more than four decades...

06:13.866 --> 06:18.066
Tony came to fame in
1978 in the hit sitcom "Taxi"

06:19.300 --> 06:22.133
playing a Brooklyn-born
boxer turned cab driver.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.466
A tough-talker
with a soft heart.

06:25.833 --> 06:29.133
The role fit Tony to a tee.

06:29.566 --> 06:31.809
Tony grew up in east New York,

06:31.833 --> 06:34.376
one of Brooklyn's
roughest neighborhoods and

06:34.400 --> 06:36.766
was fundamentally
shaped by the experience.

06:37.866 --> 06:39.176
DANZA: I was small.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.576
And unfortunately in
Brooklyn when you're small

06:41.600 --> 06:42.676
you've got to fight.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.642
You've got to fight a lot
and so I was in a lot

06:44.666 --> 06:45.643
of street fights.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.109
My father, I came home one day,

06:47.133 --> 06:49.042
I'll never forget it,
I came home one day crying.

06:49.066 --> 06:50.076
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.276
DANZA: He said to me,

06:51.300 --> 06:52.542
"I'm going to show you
how to throw a right hand"

06:52.566 --> 06:54.342
and he showed
me how to drop my shoulder and

06:54.366 --> 06:55.842
just throw a right hand.

06:55.866 --> 06:58.576
So the next day, I was
out getting bullied,

06:58.600 --> 07:01.009
somebody picked on me
and I threw a right hand.

07:01.033 --> 07:02.442
I hit the kid in the nose,

07:02.466 --> 07:04.609
and his nose bled and
everybody in the place was

07:04.633 --> 07:07.276
like holy mackerel,
look at that.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.876
GATES: We got Muhammed Ali.

07:09.900 --> 07:13.576
DANZA: Then, unfortunately,
it became something that I

07:13.600 --> 07:17.309
kind of liked.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.176
GATES: Much like Terry Crews,

07:19.200 --> 07:22.076
Tony came to see
his athletic ability as his

07:22.100 --> 07:23.866
ticket to a better life...

07:24.833 --> 07:27.509
Though he went to college
and studied to be a teacher,

07:27.533 --> 07:31.700
by the time he was early 20s,
he was boxing professionally,

07:32.533 --> 07:34.600
with decidedly mixed results.

07:36.133 --> 07:37.709
DANZA: I could punch.
GATES: Really?

07:37.733 --> 07:40.800
DANZA: I could really punch.
I wasn't much defense.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.809
I had some skills,
but I could bang.

07:44.833 --> 07:45.976
If I hit you.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.676
I used to miss guys
and knock them out.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.209
I mean it was crazy.
I mean it.

07:51.233 --> 07:54.942
I won, all the fights I won,
I won by knockout.

07:54.966 --> 07:57.042
All the fights I lost
I lost by knock out.

07:57.066 --> 07:59.476
The good news was if you
had a dinner date afterwards

07:59.500 --> 08:01.309
you were never late.

08:01.333 --> 08:03.609
GATES: So how did your
parents feel about you turning

08:03.633 --> 08:05.709
professional boxer?

08:05.733 --> 08:07.576
DANZA: They were sick.

08:07.600 --> 08:12.876
My mother was like I cannot
believe I work hard to get you

08:12.900 --> 08:16.142
to go to college and then
you're going to do this.

08:16.166 --> 08:19.709
But I, and I'll be
honest with you,

08:19.733 --> 08:22.709
now I look back at it
and what I put them through.

08:22.733 --> 08:25.076
You know, they both
saw me get knocked out.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.276
GATES: That's tough.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.766
DANZA: Just one of
the worst feelings.

08:29.733 --> 08:32.309
GATES: Happily, Tony,
and his parents,

08:32.333 --> 08:34.366
were all in for a surprise.

08:34.833 --> 08:39.400
In 1977, a talent scout
noticed Tony at a gym...

08:40.033 --> 08:42.709
Soon he was auditioning
for roles in films,

08:42.733 --> 08:45.966
trying to nurture an acting
career alongside his boxing.

08:46.900 --> 08:51.233
And on one magical night,
everything came together.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.409
DANZA: I went to an open call
for a gang picture in New York.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.909
I remember a lot of
feathers, I don't know why.

08:57.933 --> 09:02.033
But anyway, I brought
the poster from my,

09:02.366 --> 09:03.876
I was fighting at Prospect Hall,

09:03.900 --> 09:05.809
it was my first main event,
had my picture.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.376
It said "Tough Tony Danza,
Brooklyn's Knockout Artist."

09:08.400 --> 09:12.242
And when I finished reading,

09:12.266 --> 09:18.900
it was Larry Gordon,
Walter Hill, and uh, and uh,

09:19.266 --> 09:20.476
and Joel Silver.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.642
I mean the big
action movie guys,

09:22.666 --> 09:24.742
and it was at the end of
a long conference table.

09:24.766 --> 09:26.342
They were all
sitting over there,

09:26.366 --> 09:29.776
and I read and they said
thank you very much like

09:29.800 --> 09:31.276
they always do at
these auditions.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.442
Thank you very much.

09:32.466 --> 09:34.042
When they said thank you
very much, they said, hey,

09:34.066 --> 09:37.309
by the way, you really
want to see a warrior and

09:37.333 --> 09:40.376
I unfurled the poster and
I said come see me fight.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.309
GATES: That's a good move.
DANZA: They said,

09:42.333 --> 09:43.476
"Wait a minute,
you're a fighter?"

09:43.500 --> 09:45.342
I said, "Yeah."
So they came to see me fight.

09:45.366 --> 09:46.809
GATES: No.
DANZA: Yeah.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.509
This whole bunch of Hollywood
people came to this fight in

09:49.533 --> 09:51.409
Prospect Hall in Brooklyn.

09:51.433 --> 09:53.142
I was the main event.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.942
They sit through
five boring fights.

09:54.966 --> 09:56.376
It was a terrible card.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.376
I remember it was just
a horrible card.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.242
But I knocked the guy
out and into the front row

10:02.266 --> 10:05.209
in like 40 seconds or something.

10:05.233 --> 10:08.509
I'll never forget, I was
walking around the ring and

10:08.533 --> 10:11.142
I saw Larry Gordon,
we made eye contact.

10:11.166 --> 10:14.066
He went, "That's the greatest
audition I've ever seen."

10:18.300 --> 10:20.542
GATES: My two guests have
both reinvented themselves

10:20.566 --> 10:24.166
through a combination of hard
work and personal strength...

10:25.066 --> 10:27.776
It was time to
introduce them to ancestors

10:27.800 --> 10:29.633
who shared those traits.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.933
We started with Tony Danza...

10:37.200 --> 10:39.909
Tony knew that his
paternal grandparents,

10:39.933 --> 10:42.576
Anthony and Jennie Iadanza,

10:42.600 --> 10:44.942
had emigrated from
Italy to the United States

10:44.966 --> 10:46.800
in the early 20th century.

10:47.566 --> 10:51.076
In fact, Tony told me
that their story was central

10:51.100 --> 10:53.066
to his identity...

10:53.333 --> 10:56.933
But, as it turns out, he
didn't have the full story.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.976
In the 1930 census,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.109
we found Anthony
and Jennie in Brooklyn,

11:03.133 --> 11:05.033
raising seven children together.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.776
But when we jumped
back twenty-five years,

11:07.800 --> 11:10.376
to the 1905 census for New York,

11:10.400 --> 11:12.976
we found Anthony in
the same neighborhood,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.700
married to a woman
named "Josephine".

11:17.733 --> 11:19.342
GATES: Ever hear of her?

11:19.366 --> 11:21.809
Well, Tony, our research
indicates that your grandfather

11:21.833 --> 11:23.309
was married once before.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.976
DANZA: Is that right?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.942
GATES: Yes.

11:26.966 --> 11:29.276
Your grandfather was
married once before he

11:29.300 --> 11:31.809
married your grandmother Jennie,

11:31.833 --> 11:35.242
and we believe that his
first wife Josephine likely

11:35.266 --> 11:39.600
died sometime after that
census was taken in June 1905.

11:40.733 --> 11:41.942
What's it like to learn that?

11:41.966 --> 11:43.509
DANZA: Now, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:43.533 --> 11:44.876
So before Jennie arrives...

11:44.900 --> 11:46.776
GATES: Yeah.
He was married to another woman.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.276
He was married to a woman
named Josephine, who dies,

11:49.300 --> 11:51.876
and there's no recollection
in your family?

11:51.900 --> 11:55.533
DANZA: There's none.
Not a word.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.309
GATES: This census
would prove to be a

11:58.333 --> 12:01.009
gold mine for our research,

12:01.033 --> 12:03.242
not only revealing
Tony's grandfather's early

12:03.266 --> 12:06.976
marriage but also providing
us with insight into how he

12:07.000 --> 12:10.809
and his relatives carved
out lives for themselves

12:10.833 --> 12:12.800
as immigrants in America.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.676
On the entry for Anthony,

12:15.700 --> 12:17.942
we saw that he
worked as a "helper"...

12:17.966 --> 12:21.142
And on the entry for a
household just two doors away,

12:21.166 --> 12:23.766
we saw who he was helping...

12:24.266 --> 12:29.109
DANZA: "Iadanza, Matteo,
occupation saloon keeper."

12:29.133 --> 12:31.442
GATES: Matteo was your
grandfather Anthony's older...

12:31.466 --> 12:32.709
BOTH: Brother.

12:32.733 --> 12:35.009
GATES: And your grandfather
Anthony was a helper

12:35.033 --> 12:36.176
in the saloon.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.976
DANZA: In the saloon.
GATES: In the bar, there you go.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.509
And talk about
history repeating itself,

12:41.533 --> 12:42.909
you worked as a bartender.

12:42.933 --> 12:45.076
DANZA: That's true.
That's right.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.309
I'll tell you the truth,

12:46.333 --> 12:47.909
that's where I learned to
act when I was a bartender.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.242
Bartending is where
you learn how to act.

12:49.266 --> 12:52.309
GATES: Oh, I'm sure.
Well, please turn the page.

12:52.333 --> 12:55.333
DANZA: Oh, man.
They had a bar.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.009
GATES: Yeah, how about that?

12:58.033 --> 13:01.842
Tony, you're looking at
the Brooklyn Standard Union.

13:01.866 --> 13:03.376
DANZA: Oh my God, this is,
holy mackerel.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.766
GATES: This article was
published February 14, 1905.

13:07.266 --> 13:09.100
Would you please read
the transcribed section?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.542
DANZA: "Police Raid
on Broadway House,

13:11.566 --> 13:12.942
The Standard Union.

13:12.966 --> 13:16.342
The evidence pointed to the
presence in the house of women

13:16.366 --> 13:18.666
of questionable character.

13:18.966 --> 13:23.276
Detectives, made for
the place again at number 2048

13:23.300 --> 13:26.876
is a Raines Law Hotel
owned by Matteo Iadanza.

13:26.900 --> 13:32.176
There is a passageway in
it leading to number 2046,

13:32.200 --> 13:36.176
which the police say is
used as a disorderly house.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.242
Detectives knocked on
the door of number 2046 and

13:39.266 --> 13:40.809
Iadanza opened the door.

13:40.833 --> 13:43.076
The Detective ran
up from the rear and

13:43.100 --> 13:44.376
began a thorough search,

13:44.400 --> 13:47.909
which was rewarded by
finding a trap door alongside a

13:47.933 --> 13:52.709
blind partition in a small
middle room on the second floor.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.976
The Detective
opened the trap door,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.876
the officers lifted a young
woman out of the pit and

13:57.900 --> 14:01.876
bundled her into the patrol
wagon along with Iadanza.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.476
Bail on the charge of
keeping a disorderly house was

14:04.500 --> 14:07.542
fixed at $2,000."

14:07.566 --> 14:09.109
GATES: So you understand...

14:09.133 --> 14:12.776
DANZA: I love this.
A baffling blind trap was found.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.566
GATES: Isn't that amazing.
DANZA: That's unbelievable.

14:17.533 --> 14:19.742
GATES: Tony's great-uncle
Matteo was part of a

14:19.766 --> 14:22.566
fascinating moment in
American history...

14:23.300 --> 14:27.609
In 1896, New York state
passed a liquor law,

14:27.633 --> 14:30.009
a predecessor to prohibition,

14:30.033 --> 14:33.242
banning the sale of
alcohol on Sundays,

14:33.266 --> 14:36.600
except in hotels
with at least ten rooms.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.609
For saloon keepers like Matteo,

14:39.633 --> 14:41.376
this was a disaster.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.076
Since they made
such a large share of

14:43.100 --> 14:45.142
their income on Sundays,

14:45.166 --> 14:48.642
the only day of the week
that most workers had off.

14:48.666 --> 14:51.600
So they came up with an
ingenious solution:

14:51.933 --> 14:54.676
converting their
bars into fake hotels,

14:54.700 --> 14:58.209
with makeshift walls, and
continuing to sell alcohol

14:58.233 --> 15:00.376
just like before...

15:00.400 --> 15:05.000
Often, it seems, they got into
other illegal activity as well.

15:05.733 --> 15:06.876
DANZA: Wow.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.576
GATES: What's it like to
learn that your family was

15:08.600 --> 15:11.742
part of this particular chapter
in the history of America?

15:11.766 --> 15:12.842
DANZA: Well, you know,

15:12.866 --> 15:17.600
it's strange because
my father was really...

15:18.733 --> 15:24.809
He reminds me of
Robert De Niro in

15:24.833 --> 15:25.976
"A Bronx Tale".

15:26.000 --> 15:28.142
GATES: Right.
DANZA: He was that kind of guy.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.909
Stay away from that stuff
because it was all

15:30.933 --> 15:32.176
over the neighborhood, you know.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.476
You'd walk by the taxi stand
and you'd see those guys and

15:36.500 --> 15:38.009
you know what they're doing.

15:38.033 --> 15:42.342
So I'm surprised that
this is in there.

15:42.366 --> 15:45.133
I'm really and yet...

15:47.100 --> 15:48.642
GATES: And yet?

15:48.666 --> 15:53.809
DANZA: Well, I think in
Brooklyn in general there's

15:53.833 --> 15:55.733
always a bit of the
bandit in everybody.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.009
GATES: Matteo certainly
embodied a good bit

15:59.033 --> 16:00.942
of the "bandit."

16:00.966 --> 16:02.676
But setting aside his morals,

16:02.700 --> 16:04.809
he also played a
very significant role in

16:04.833 --> 16:07.800
bringing Tony's
family to America,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.409
as evidenced by the arrival
of a ship from Naples, Italy

16:11.433 --> 16:14.433
on July 15, 1906...

16:15.233 --> 16:18.466
Onboard was Tony's
grandmother Jennie...

16:21.433 --> 16:24.566
DANZA: "Zarro, Giovanna,
age: 18, single,

16:24.933 --> 16:27.176
occupation: dress maker.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.376
Last Permanent Residence:
Pietrelcina.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.276
By Whom Passage Paid: Uncle.

16:33.300 --> 16:37.009
Whether joining a relative:
Uncle Matteo Iadanza,

16:37.033 --> 16:40.266
2048 Broadway,
Brooklyn, New York."

16:41.266 --> 16:43.176
GATES: Isn't that cool?
DANZA: Wow.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.076
GATES: So Tony, this marks the
moment when your grandmother,

16:45.100 --> 16:49.809
Giovanna, Jennie, Zarro
stepped foot on American soil.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.042
And as you can see,

16:51.066 --> 16:54.809
her passage was paid by none
other than Matteo Iadanza,

16:54.833 --> 16:57.642
your grandfather
Anthony's brother,

16:57.666 --> 17:00.842
her future brother-in-
law, the saloonkeeper.

17:00.866 --> 17:02.842
What's it like to
see that record?

17:02.866 --> 17:04.142
DANZA: I guess he had the money.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.409
GATES: He had the cash, baby.

17:06.433 --> 17:08.376
DANZA: That's the
first thing, you know.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.842
GATES: And check this out.

17:10.866 --> 17:14.309
The reason that Jennie
referred to Matteo as her uncle

17:14.333 --> 17:16.409
was that actually
Matteo was married to

17:16.433 --> 17:18.876
Jennie's aunt Rufana.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.242
Did you know that?

17:21.266 --> 17:25.809
DANZA: No. This is all so,
you know, pins and needles.

17:25.833 --> 17:29.066
It's really, its spine-tingling.
It really is.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.676
GATES: Well, we don't know if
your grandfather Anthony was

17:31.700 --> 17:36.142
with his first wife Josephine
when Jennie arrived in America.

17:36.166 --> 17:40.042
All we know is that Jennie went
to live at 2048 Broadway where

17:40.066 --> 17:43.366
the saloon was located
with Matteo and Rufana.

17:44.033 --> 17:48.076
And then eight months
later on March 7, 1907,

17:48.100 --> 17:50.242
your grandparents got married.

17:50.266 --> 17:51.776
DANZA: They got married.
GATES: Yeah.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.342
DANZA: So Josephine,
by then is probably...

17:54.366 --> 17:55.376
GATES: She's gone.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.876
DANZA: Morte, yeah.
GATES: Yeah.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.576
What's it like to
learn this story?

17:58.600 --> 18:00.942
DANZA: Man, I'm telling you.
We were saloon owners.

18:00.966 --> 18:03.342
This is great.

18:03.366 --> 18:04.442
GATES: You were
tricking the law.

18:04.466 --> 18:05.642
I like that.

18:05.666 --> 18:07.333
DANZA: This is incredible.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.809
GATES: The passenger list for
the ship that brought Jennie to

18:10.833 --> 18:15.466
New York also gave us the name
of her hometown: Pietrelcina,

18:16.366 --> 18:19.676
a village in the Campania
region of southern Italy and

18:19.700 --> 18:24.009
the place where Tony's father's
family had lived for centuries

18:24.033 --> 18:26.533
likely as subsistence farmers.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.976
Indeed, we were able to map
Tony's roots in the region back

18:32.000 --> 18:37.742
to at least the year 1774,
giving name to five generations

18:37.766 --> 18:40.000
of his ancestors...

18:41.266 --> 18:43.042
DANZA: That's incredible.

18:43.066 --> 18:46.209
GATES: Now, Tony, you're
quite a restless guy.

18:46.233 --> 18:48.409
You're constantly
reinventing yourself.

18:48.433 --> 18:51.476
What's it like for you to know
that your ancestors stayed put

18:51.500 --> 18:55.642
in one place for so long?

18:55.666 --> 18:58.476
DANZA: I just, it
speaks to how people were

18:58.500 --> 19:03.176
at that time, I think, you know,
and it also speaks to a

19:03.200 --> 19:07.209
way of life
that probably was ongoing for

19:07.233 --> 19:09.809
many years and didn't
change that much.

19:09.833 --> 19:14.242
What also speaks to me
though is that if you do go

19:14.266 --> 19:19.676
back this far and there
is this roots and heritage

19:19.700 --> 19:22.976
in this place and
yet they were so determined

19:23.000 --> 19:23.977
to get to America.

19:24.001 --> 19:25.642
GATES: Absolutely, yeah.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.176
DANZA: That really strikes me.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.376
GATES: Probably
motivated by poverty.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.776
DANZA: Poverty.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.376
There's something beautiful
about seeing this.

19:33.400 --> 19:39.376
It's just, it does really give
you a different feeling about

19:39.400 --> 19:45.533
your place in the succession
that's been going on since 1774.

19:47.066 --> 19:48.276
GATES: Yeah.

19:48.300 --> 19:53.000
DANZA: You know, it gives you
this feeling of real...

19:54.866 --> 19:57.342
Wait a minute, we've
been here a long time.

19:57.366 --> 19:59.066
Longer than I thought.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.276
GATES: Much like Tony,
Terry Crews was about to meet

20:03.300 --> 20:07.900
ancestors who overcame a
formidable amount of adversity.

20:08.733 --> 20:11.609
The story began with his
maternal grandmother,

20:11.633 --> 20:14.842
a woman named Mary Ellen Walker.

20:14.866 --> 20:18.876
Mary was born in rural Georgia
but lived most of her life in

20:18.900 --> 20:21.976
Flint, Michigan where
she played a pivotal role

20:22.000 --> 20:23.866
in Terry's childhood.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.442
Growing up,

20:25.466 --> 20:28.842
he called her "mama'
and Mary's love, support,

20:28.866 --> 20:32.109
and larger-than-life
personality were among the

20:32.133 --> 20:35.500
brightest spots in
Terry's turbulent youth.

20:37.766 --> 20:40.109
CREWS: This was the thing.
My mother had me at 18.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.142
GATES: Right.

20:41.166 --> 20:42.209
CREWS: And she
had my brother at 16.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.276
GATES: Right.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.509
CREWS: So she was
almost a big sister.

20:44.533 --> 20:45.742
GATES: Yeah.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.809
CREWS: You know, and she didn't
like us to call her "Mom."

20:47.833 --> 20:48.942
GATES: Mm-hmm.

20:48.966 --> 20:50.209
CREWS: She got with us
and we called her "Trish."

20:50.233 --> 20:51.242
"Hey, Trish."

20:51.266 --> 20:53.476
So she was
almost like a big sister to us.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.700
But Mama, however, Mama was...

20:57.666 --> 20:59.676
she was everything.

20:59.700 --> 21:04.633
And one thing about Mama is
that she had made her money.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.309
GATES: Mm-hmm.

21:06.333 --> 21:09.309
CREWS: And she made her way
and she worked like crazy.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.742
She worked at AC Spark Plug.

21:10.766 --> 21:11.842
GATES: Mm-hmm.

21:11.866 --> 21:13.742
CREWS: And this was the
weird dynamic that was in

21:13.766 --> 21:16.009
our family is that my
mother was always like,

21:16.033 --> 21:17.709
"You know, your
grandmother got money."

21:17.733 --> 21:18.742
But she just said,

21:18.766 --> 21:19.976
"She could be giving us some.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.676
But she ain't doing it
because she knows that..."

21:21.700 --> 21:23.442
She'd go into this whole thing.

21:23.466 --> 21:25.142
And I kind of developed
this attitude like, hey,

21:25.166 --> 21:26.676
Mama need to give us
some money, you know.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.876
GATES: Right.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.809
CREWS: But when you look
at what she accomplished.

21:29.833 --> 21:30.976
GATES: Mm-hmm.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.442
CREWS: This, this
woman from Georgia

21:34.466 --> 21:37.542
came all the way up here,
made it happen for her family.

21:37.566 --> 21:38.776
GATES: Yeah.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.142
CREWS: Paid off a house...
GATES: And paid off a house.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.042
CREWS: And cars, went
through a couple husbands.

21:42.066 --> 21:44.000
GATES: Yeah.
CREWS: And survived.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.476
GATES: Mary was,
indeed, a survivor...

21:48.500 --> 21:51.776
Much like Terry, she'd
endured a very challenging

21:51.800 --> 21:56.666
childhood and found
stability in an unlikely place.

21:59.166 --> 22:02.909
Sometime in the late 1930s,
when she was still a teenager,

22:02.933 --> 22:05.142
Mary moved from
Georgia to Flint,

22:05.166 --> 22:06.942
not to live with her parents,

22:06.966 --> 22:09.709
but to live with her
maternal grandfather,

22:09.733 --> 22:11.766
a man named Edward Elbert,

22:12.500 --> 22:15.776
we found Mary in
the 1940 census.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.842
One of thirteen
people in Edward's

22:17.866 --> 22:20.109
multi-generational household,

22:20.133 --> 22:22.666
which included four
of his children,

22:23.233 --> 22:25.100
as well as a daughter-in-law...

22:27.066 --> 22:29.476
And he was also taking care
of five of his grandchildren.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.576
CREWS: Wow.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.276
GATES: Including
your grandmother.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.176
Which of course
raises a question.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.442
Where were Mary's parents?

22:35.466 --> 22:36.509
CREWS: Yeah.

22:36.533 --> 22:37.809
GATES: Well, we aren't sure.

22:37.833 --> 22:39.309
Mary's parents,
your great-grandparents,

22:39.333 --> 22:42.376
were named Robert Walker
and Leonora Elbert.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.409
CREWS: Mm-hmm.

22:43.433 --> 22:44.676
GATES: And we know
very little about them.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.309
We know that they
were both born in Georgia and

22:47.333 --> 22:50.042
they were both born
in the early 1900s.

22:50.066 --> 22:52.933
But we can't find either of
them in the 1940 census.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.942
It seems they sent their
children to live in Flint with

22:55.966 --> 22:59.900
their grandfather sometime
between 1935 and 1940.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.276
Did Mary ever talk about them?

23:02.300 --> 23:03.876
CREWS: No, she didn't.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.009
GATES: And think about this.

23:05.033 --> 23:06.509
In 1940 your
great-great-grandfather

23:06.533 --> 23:09.642
Edward was 69 years old
and he was taking care of

23:09.666 --> 23:11.776
this enormous household.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.700
CREWS: Wow.

23:15.266 --> 23:17.642
GATES: Terry wondered how
could Edward have possibly

23:17.666 --> 23:19.866
supported so many people.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.509
The 1940 census
indicated that he was a

23:23.533 --> 23:26.233
farmhand who owned his own home,

23:27.200 --> 23:28.476
but at that time,

23:28.500 --> 23:31.476
America was mired in
the great depression and

23:31.500 --> 23:34.633
farmhands were
making almost no money.

23:35.533 --> 23:38.809
Things didn't quite add up
until we discovered that Edward

23:38.833 --> 23:41.933
had some other
occupations as well...

23:43.300 --> 23:44.842
GATES: Could you
please turn the page?

23:44.866 --> 23:46.733
CREWS: Whoo.

23:47.033 --> 23:48.709
GATES: Terry, this is so cool.

23:48.733 --> 23:51.276
This is an ad in a newspaper
called "The Detroit Tribune".

23:51.300 --> 23:52.476
CREWS: Oh.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.576
GATES: Published on
August 16th, 1941.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.066
Would you please
read what it says?

23:56.300 --> 23:58.576
CREWS: What? Okay.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.542
"Edward Elbert.
Red Man's Emergency Wagon.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.709
Hauling all kinds.

24:04.733 --> 24:06.209
Sodding and cement work.

24:06.233 --> 24:07.976
Hunting dogs for sale."

24:08.000 --> 24:10.376
Oh my god.
He was a businessman.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.509
GATES: He was a businessman.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.842
CREWS: This is what I love.

24:12.866 --> 24:14.709
Oh my goodness and you know
I'm going to get a tee-shirt

24:14.733 --> 24:15.710
with this on it.

24:15.734 --> 24:16.976
I'm going to bring
this business back,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.176
I'm gonna tell you that.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.276
GATES: Your great-great
-grandfather was a

24:20.300 --> 24:22.342
super industrious hustler.

24:22.366 --> 24:24.942
Not only was he
working as a farmhand,

24:24.966 --> 24:28.409
he also did all kinds of
handiwork on the side.

24:28.433 --> 24:30.509
He's selling dogs,
he's selling cement,

24:30.533 --> 24:33.676
he's hauling trash,
he's doing lawn work,

24:33.700 --> 24:37.433
and he's taking out an ad for
his services in a newspaper.

24:37.833 --> 24:40.842
Did you have any idea that you
had this entrepreneurial vein

24:40.866 --> 24:43.476
in your ancestral line?

24:43.500 --> 24:45.042
CREWS: I had no idea.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.542
I'm sorry, I'm just
getting emotional.

24:46.566 --> 24:48.700
This is...

24:48.900 --> 24:50.076
I had no idea.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.209
GATES: Yeah.

24:51.233 --> 24:53.776
CREWS: Because all I do
is think of new ideas.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.009
GATES: Mmm-hmm, yeah.

24:55.033 --> 24:58.909
CREWS: The new things and
ways and new opportunities.

24:58.933 --> 25:00.342
And I'm looking at,

25:00.366 --> 25:02.942
here he was
doing the same thing.

25:02.966 --> 25:04.842
GATES: You didn't
invent it, you inherited it.

25:04.866 --> 25:06.433
CREWS: That's right.

25:07.633 --> 25:10.376
GATES: Edward's accomplishments
are all the more impressive

25:10.400 --> 25:12.900
given what we discovered next...

25:13.700 --> 25:17.809
In the 1870 census, we
found Edward's father.

25:17.833 --> 25:21.700
A man named Eddie or Ebb
Elbert and his parents,

25:22.466 --> 25:24.276
George and Fannie Newsome,

25:24.300 --> 25:26.876
living in Sandersville, Georgia.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.109
All were newly
freed from slavery.

25:30.133 --> 25:33.642
And as we set out to trace
them back through time,

25:33.666 --> 25:36.133
we encountered a
horrifying story.

25:37.833 --> 25:40.776
In December of 1858,

25:40.800 --> 25:44.409
Fannie and five of
her children were separated

25:44.433 --> 25:47.376
following the
death of their owner.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.376
GATES: Their family
against their will,

25:50.400 --> 25:53.909
out of their control,
was torn apart, ripped apart.

25:53.933 --> 25:57.576
CREWS: First of all, I have
five beautiful children.

25:57.600 --> 26:03.500
I cannot imagine any of
my babies being yanked and

26:04.000 --> 26:06.809
pulled out of my
arms into some...

26:06.833 --> 26:10.042
And taken away into
someone else's household.

26:10.066 --> 26:12.276
I'd, I, I would never
know where they went.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.376
GATES: Right.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.942
CREWS: And with no hope
of seeing them again.

26:14.966 --> 26:17.409
GATES: This is just in
one day, one action.

26:17.433 --> 26:20.142
CREWS: Can you imagine having
your family separated and

26:20.166 --> 26:21.742
the generations all...

26:21.766 --> 26:22.842
And you...

26:22.866 --> 26:24.742
One day you saw your mom,

26:24.766 --> 26:26.209
and the next day
she was gone forever.

26:26.233 --> 26:27.309
GATES: She's gone.

26:27.333 --> 26:28.776
CREWS: Oh, man.
I can't imagine.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.033
GATES: It's, it's
heart-wrenching.

26:33.266 --> 26:34.966
CREWS: Incredible.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.642
GATES: Fannie was
about 32 years old when her

26:38.666 --> 26:40.700
owner's estate was divided.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.476
At the time,

26:42.500 --> 26:46.076
her husband George was
enslaved on a nearby property,

26:46.100 --> 26:49.266
owned by a planter
named Hezekiah Newsome.

26:50.833 --> 26:55.176
So, Fannie was now in danger
of never seeing her husband,

26:55.200 --> 26:58.000
or some of her children again.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.176
But, miraculously,
that's not what happened.

27:02.200 --> 27:06.642
In 1861, Fannie and two of
her children were hired out

27:06.666 --> 27:09.776
to work on the
Newsome plantation.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.566
Reuniting the family,
at least in part.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.276
GATES: They didn't
get sold down the river.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.542
CREWS: Yes.

27:17.566 --> 27:19.609
GATES: They were on, they,
nearby, and they brought them

27:19.633 --> 27:20.610
back together by...

27:20.634 --> 27:21.842
CREWS: Wow.

27:21.866 --> 27:23.176
GATES: Hiring them
out for a nominal sum.

27:23.200 --> 27:27.009
$25, which is $656 in 2020.

27:27.033 --> 27:28.376
CREWS: Oh, oh.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.776
GATES: So, what do
you think this was like

27:29.800 --> 27:31.842
for your ancestors,
after this three-year period?

27:31.866 --> 27:33.376
CREWS: Oh.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.642
GATES: On the one hand,
it's a happy moment.

27:34.666 --> 27:35.809
CREWS: Listen, I am...

27:35.833 --> 27:37.542
First of all, I'm jumping
with joy right now, right?

27:37.566 --> 27:40.542
I mean, the reunion
had to be spectacular.

27:40.566 --> 27:41.909
GATES: Yeah, isn't that cool?

27:41.933 --> 27:43.542
CREWS: That is the
coolest thing ever.

27:43.566 --> 27:44.709
GATES: Back in the house again.

27:44.733 --> 27:46.942
CREWS: In the midst of
all this horror they get to

27:46.966 --> 27:48.076
be back together again.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.842
GATES: Yeah, they get
to be back together again.

27:49.866 --> 27:52.000
CREWS: Wow.

27:52.733 --> 27:55.842
GATES: This reunion
was only the beginning.

27:55.866 --> 27:57.309
Four years later,

27:57.333 --> 28:01.309
the end of the Civil War
would bring an end to slavery,

28:01.333 --> 28:04.576
and Terry's ancestors
would finally be free to

28:04.600 --> 28:06.833
live as they chose...

28:07.733 --> 28:10.609
Returning to the 1870 census,

28:10.633 --> 28:13.966
we looked with fresh eyes at
George and Fannie's household,

28:15.033 --> 28:17.242
seeing it now as
evidence of how a family

28:17.266 --> 28:21.833
torn apart by slavery had pulled
itself back together again...

28:23.566 --> 28:24.842
CREWS: Wow.

28:24.866 --> 28:26.709
GATES: What's it like to know
that your ancestors had such

28:26.733 --> 28:27.876
strong family bonds?

28:27.900 --> 28:30.242
CREWS: This is beautiful.
It's beautiful.

28:30.266 --> 28:32.676
GATES: They managed to
create a family sometime in

28:32.700 --> 28:37.242
the mid-1840s and keep that
family together and intact,

28:37.266 --> 28:40.642
so that five years after
the Civil War, when the,

28:40.666 --> 28:43.042
the enumerator from the
census came by, they were...

28:43.066 --> 28:44.076
CREWS: They were...

28:44.100 --> 28:46.042
GATES: All living
together 30 years later.

28:46.066 --> 28:48.833
CREWS: Man, this is a movie.
This is a movie.

28:49.133 --> 28:50.642
GATES: It's true.
CREWS: No, it is.

28:50.666 --> 28:51.676
GATES: And it's your story.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.476
CREWS: This is a movie!
Think about this.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.609
GATES: It's your story...

28:54.633 --> 28:56.476
CREWS: They were all
split up, different homes,

28:56.500 --> 29:01.866
but, and they found a
way to stick together.

29:04.466 --> 29:07.042
GATES: We'd already revealed
how Tony Danza's paternal

29:07.066 --> 29:11.109
ancestors made their
way from Italy to America,

29:11.133 --> 29:13.833
via a Brooklyn saloon...

29:14.500 --> 29:16.942
Now, turning to
his mother's roots,

29:16.966 --> 29:20.533
we uncovered a journey that
was even more surprising...

29:21.233 --> 29:25.909
The story begins with Tony's
grandfather, Antonino Camisa,

29:25.933 --> 29:29.376
a legendary figure
within his family.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.842
Tony believed that in 1917,

29:31.866 --> 29:35.376
his grandfather came
to New York from Sicily,

29:35.400 --> 29:37.642
hoping to earn money...

29:37.666 --> 29:41.866
The truth, however,
was far more complicated.

29:42.100 --> 29:45.009
Antonino actually
came here much earlier,

29:45.033 --> 29:46.876
along with his brother,

29:46.900 --> 29:50.566
on a ship that
arrived in Boston in 1909...

29:52.633 --> 29:56.066
DANZA: Now, wait a minute.
So this...

29:56.533 --> 29:58.109
GATES: That's your
grandfather Antonino.

29:58.133 --> 30:00.142
DANZA: And it's 1909.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.909
So, I'm off by a bunch of
years then because I thought

30:03.933 --> 30:05.676
he came in 1917.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.376
GATES: 1909, there it is.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.809
Tony, you're looking at the
moment that your grandfather,

30:11.833 --> 30:14.609
set foot in America for
the very first time.

30:14.633 --> 30:17.242
What's it like to see
that and to see the ship?

30:17.266 --> 30:18.409
DANZA: The ship is...

30:18.433 --> 30:21.376
I mean it must have been
just a luxurious journey.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.442
Oh, my God.

30:22.466 --> 30:24.109
GATES: And believe
me they were not in the

30:24.133 --> 30:25.409
first-class cabin, right.

30:25.433 --> 30:26.809
DANZA: Geeze.

30:26.833 --> 30:33.033
It's amazing and it also
pushes back the timeline for me.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.166
You know, that's incredible.

30:37.933 --> 30:41.242
GATES: Tony's "timeline"
was probably off because his

30:41.266 --> 30:44.576
grandfather's life
had been so difficult,

30:44.600 --> 30:47.966
so its details had
not been passed on.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.942
Records show that after
Antonino arrived in Boston,

30:51.966 --> 30:54.176
he made his way to
the industrial town of

30:54.200 --> 30:56.576
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania,

30:56.600 --> 31:00.609
where he found work as
what was known as a "tinner."

31:00.633 --> 31:03.200
It was a dreadful
way to earn a living.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.476
"tinners" spent
their days in hot,

31:06.500 --> 31:10.409
noisy mills passing
sheets of steel through vats

31:10.433 --> 31:13.009
of acid and molten metal.

31:13.033 --> 31:16.633
Breathing in chemical fumes
and earning abysmal pay.

31:18.800 --> 31:23.209
DANZA: Imagine making that trip
and hearing all these stories

31:23.233 --> 31:26.209
of paved with gold, the streets.

31:26.233 --> 31:28.776
GATES: Statue of Liberty,
5th Avenue, Madison Avenue.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.676
Then you go to Canonsburg.

31:30.700 --> 31:31.942
DANZA: And be a tinner.

31:31.966 --> 31:33.409
GATES: And you're a tinner.

31:33.433 --> 31:37.509
DANZA: Well, you know,
you feel like somebody

31:37.533 --> 31:39.009
sacrificed for you.

31:39.033 --> 31:40.476
GATES: Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.076
How do you think he
was able to endure?

31:42.100 --> 31:44.876
DANZA: I'm telling you,
I just want to...

31:44.900 --> 31:47.466
(crying).

31:53.633 --> 31:56.009
It's a lot to go through.

31:56.033 --> 31:58.033
GATES: It is.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.533
DANZA: You know
what's funny is...

32:04.300 --> 32:10.300
I never, uh, even considered,
uh, liken a, a long heritage.

32:11.566 --> 32:15.633
It never really entered my mind.

32:16.333 --> 32:18.776
So, this, uh...

32:18.800 --> 32:20.042
I don't know.

32:20.066 --> 32:23.966
There's an effect on you,
some kind of crazy,

32:24.733 --> 32:27.566
I don't know,
gratefulness or something.

32:28.533 --> 32:29.676
I don't know what to say.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.842
Sorry.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.800
GATES: No. The affect is...

32:35.600 --> 32:37.676
DANZA: I think everybody
should go through this.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.442
GATES: I think everybody should.

32:39.466 --> 32:41.176
You know, it's very powerful.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.142
It's a very powerful
experience and you know what,

32:44.166 --> 32:46.176
I have no idea why.

32:46.200 --> 32:51.300
DANZA: Yeah, I don't know why
tinner is striking me that way.

32:52.433 --> 32:53.876
GATES: Yeah well, he was
paying his dues, man.

32:53.900 --> 32:56.176
He was working six days
a week 10 hours a day.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.733
DANZA: Yeah.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.809
GATES: Despite his grueling job,

33:01.833 --> 33:05.000
Antonio tried to make a
life for himself in America.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.976
By 1914, he had married a
fellow Italian immigrant,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.642
Tony's grandmother
Anna Tummarello,

33:12.666 --> 33:14.776
and started a family.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.700
But a great deal of
tumult lay ahead.

33:18.033 --> 33:19.409
Within a few years,

33:19.433 --> 33:22.809
the couple lost two of
their children to disease and

33:22.833 --> 33:25.509
sometime around 1920,

33:25.533 --> 33:28.276
they decided to
return to Sicily...

33:28.300 --> 33:30.442
Where they were soon
reminded of why they'd left in

33:30.466 --> 33:33.233
the first place: poverty.

33:33.900 --> 33:38.109
At the time, Sicily was among
the poorest places in Europe

33:38.133 --> 33:41.366
and many struggled simply
to put food on the table.

33:42.166 --> 33:46.842
By 1929, Tony's grandparents
were back on a ship,

33:46.866 --> 33:50.976
bound for New York, now
with an even greater resolve,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.700
and many more children in tow...

33:54.533 --> 33:55.676
DANZA: This is my aunt Rose.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.909
DANZA: "Melchiorre Camisa" now,

33:59.933 --> 34:02.776
oh Mike, yeah, my uncle Mike.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.609
Anna Camisa and
Francesca Camisa, age 2.

34:06.633 --> 34:09.009
So my aunt Frances, my mother,

34:09.033 --> 34:10.809
my uncle Mike, my aunt Rose,

34:10.833 --> 34:13.766
my uncle Tony,
and my uncle John.

34:14.433 --> 34:17.676
GATES: They had five children
born in Italy and then John was

34:17.700 --> 34:19.409
born in Canonsburg.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.176
You ever seen that
document before?

34:21.200 --> 34:22.676
DANZA: No, no.

34:22.700 --> 34:23.776
GATES: Isn't that cool?

34:23.800 --> 34:24.876
DANZA: It's unbelievable.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.409
GATES: In November of 1929,

34:26.433 --> 34:28.376
your grandparents
returned to the United States

34:28.400 --> 34:30.042
with their six children,

34:30.066 --> 34:31.842
five of whom were born in Italy,

34:31.866 --> 34:34.276
including your mom, Anna.

34:34.300 --> 34:38.476
DANZA: And how about,
how about,

34:38.500 --> 34:41.642
so now you got these six kids...

34:41.666 --> 34:43.009
GATES: Yeah.

34:43.033 --> 34:44.442
DANZA: And you've already
been to America,

34:44.466 --> 34:45.942
wasn't an easy trip.

34:45.966 --> 34:48.809
It's not going to be
any easy trip to get back.

34:48.833 --> 34:52.676
I mean, it just takes an
enormous amount of gumption...

34:52.700 --> 34:54.642
GATES: Oh, absolutely.
DANZA: To get up and...

34:54.666 --> 34:58.409
Yeah, but I mean it's another
one of those sacrifice things.

34:58.433 --> 34:59.410
GATES: Oh, yeah.

34:59.434 --> 35:00.642
DANZA: Where you
do this for the kids.

35:00.666 --> 35:01.709
GATES: Right,
and for the future.

35:01.733 --> 35:04.200
DANZA: For the future.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.576
GATES: We soon discovered
that Tony's grandparents weren't

35:06.600 --> 35:08.409
the only members
of his family to make

35:08.433 --> 35:11.042
this kind of sacrifice.

35:11.066 --> 35:13.109
Moving back just one generation,

35:13.133 --> 35:16.209
we found the passenger list
for a ship that arrived in

35:16.233 --> 35:19.400
America from Naples
on October 20, 1902.

35:20.433 --> 35:24.176
Onboard were the parents
of Tony's grandmother,

35:24.200 --> 35:27.600
Antonino Tummarello
and Anna Caracci...

35:29.166 --> 35:30.942
GATES: Recognize those names?

35:30.966 --> 35:32.109
DANZA: Yeah.

35:32.133 --> 35:34.376
GATES: Those are your
great-grandparents arriving

35:34.400 --> 35:37.642
in the United States from
Italy for the very first time

35:37.666 --> 35:41.666
together in 1902
heading to New Orleans.

35:47.166 --> 35:50.266
(stammering)

35:51.866 --> 35:53.742
DANZA: And I never heard this.

35:53.766 --> 35:55.842
GATES: Your mother's
parents were not your first

35:55.866 --> 35:58.376
maternal ancestors to
try their luck in America.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.009
Your great-grandparents
came here first.

36:01.033 --> 36:03.642
What's it like to find this out?
It's stunning.

36:03.666 --> 36:05.642
DANZA: I had no idea.
I had no idea.

36:05.666 --> 36:08.709
I thought I've always
been so proud that I know

36:08.733 --> 36:13.342
that they got here and
he's in, it wasn't true.

36:13.366 --> 36:14.842
GATES: It wasn't true.

36:14.866 --> 36:17.966
DANZA: Nothing I know is true.
Oh, my God.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.309
GATES: Tony's great
-grandparents were actually

36:21.333 --> 36:24.509
part of a very
significant historical trend.

36:24.533 --> 36:27.242
Between 1884 and 1924,

36:27.266 --> 36:30.042
a huge wave of
Italian immigrants,

36:30.066 --> 36:33.076
roughly 300,000 people,

36:33.100 --> 36:35.866
moved to New Orleans
looking for work.

36:37.266 --> 36:38.976
Most were Sicilians,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.509
like Tony's ancestors
and as newspapers from

36:41.533 --> 36:43.309
the era make clear,

36:43.333 --> 36:46.366
the work they found
was often backbreaking...

36:48.900 --> 36:51.109
GATES: Tony, this was published
in the Times-Democrat,

36:51.133 --> 36:56.242
a New Orleans daily newspaper
on the 13 of July 1900.

36:56.266 --> 36:58.242
This was about two years
before the arrival of

36:58.266 --> 36:59.509
your great-grandparents.

36:59.533 --> 37:01.933
Would you please read
the transcribed section?

37:03.133 --> 37:08.109
DANZA: "Italian Labor Rapidly
Ousting the Sugar Belt Negroes.

37:08.133 --> 37:10.876
Italian immigrants have
driven out at least 75% of

37:10.900 --> 37:12.609
the Negro labor.

37:12.633 --> 37:15.742
They are preferred to the
Negroes for several reasons,

37:15.766 --> 37:18.609
chief of which are that
they will work very cheap

37:18.633 --> 37:20.542
and are steady.

37:20.566 --> 37:24.009
They will work right along
all day Saturday and Sunday.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.409
Their endurance
is phenomenal."

37:26.433 --> 37:29.442
That's just...

37:29.466 --> 37:32.042
GATES: In the late 19th century,
I mean, go figure, right.

37:32.066 --> 37:35.200
DANZA: But professor...

37:37.633 --> 37:40.666
I'm trying to
think how you could be cheaper.

37:41.133 --> 37:43.742
GATES: People out of
slavery for thirty-five years.

37:43.766 --> 37:44.876
DANZA: That's what
I'm trying to say.

37:44.900 --> 37:45.976
What the heck?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.276
GATES: I know.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.276
Can you imagine how hard
things must have been in

37:49.300 --> 37:51.676
Sicily to cross
the ocean to work on a

37:51.700 --> 37:53.909
Louisiana sugar plantation?

37:53.933 --> 37:58.609
DANZA: No, I do know
that my mother told me that

37:58.633 --> 38:00.242
they were starving.

38:00.266 --> 38:01.342
GATES: Oh, yeah.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.642
DANZA: It wasn't
even about livelihood.

38:03.666 --> 38:05.533
It was about eating.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.142
GATES: Perhaps unsurprisingly,

38:09.166 --> 38:12.800
Tony's great-grandparents
did not stay in New Orleans...

38:13.866 --> 38:16.809
Instead, they seem to have
followed an itinerant path over

38:16.833 --> 38:20.942
the next decade, before
ultimately settling back in

38:20.966 --> 38:23.000
their native Sicily.

38:23.433 --> 38:26.876
Migration patterns like this
were not uncommon at the time.

38:26.900 --> 38:30.109
Many Italians who crossed
the Atlantic later returned

38:30.133 --> 38:32.109
to their homelands.

38:32.133 --> 38:35.842
Historians have dubbed these
people "birds of passage" and

38:35.866 --> 38:39.100
Tony's great-grandparents
are prime examples...

38:39.666 --> 38:44.500
Causing Tony to reconsider,
yet again, his family's story.

38:46.133 --> 38:47.342
DANZA: Wow.

38:47.366 --> 38:49.376
GATES: Nobody ever talks
about this in our school books,

38:49.400 --> 38:52.709
but 70% of the Italians
in that period did that.

38:52.733 --> 38:54.076
They went back and forth.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.276
DANZA: They were
like migrant workers.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.442
GATES: They were
like migrant workers.

38:56.466 --> 38:58.276
DANZA: Only thing is they
had to go across an ocean.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.676
GATES: Yeah. Isn't that amazing?

39:00.700 --> 39:02.809
DANZA: What people
will do to survive.

39:02.833 --> 39:05.309
GATES: Do you feel a
connection to these people?

39:05.333 --> 39:07.009
DANZA: I'm grateful.

39:07.033 --> 39:09.542
I just feel this
tremendous gratefulness,

39:09.566 --> 39:13.509
but I'm also sort of in
awe of them as far as the way

39:13.533 --> 39:17.642
they not only persevered
and hardships and tinner and

39:17.666 --> 39:22.000
the things, but this travel.

39:23.433 --> 39:27.209
What were those journeys like?

39:27.233 --> 39:31.233
GATES: What do you think
they would have made of you?

39:33.700 --> 39:37.409
DANZA: You know, when I
went back to Sicily I was

39:37.433 --> 39:41.733
"the autore", "the cousin,"
"the cugino autore."

39:42.433 --> 39:46.276
And they were very,
very proud of me.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.876
They were very proud of me,

39:47.900 --> 39:51.109
and I'd like to think that
they would be proud of me.

39:51.133 --> 39:53.742
I know they'd be
proud of my kids,

39:53.766 --> 39:58.009
and I know they'd be
happy that I'm continuing

39:58.033 --> 40:00.376
their line, I think.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.609
GATES: Absolutely.

40:01.633 --> 40:06.442
DANZA: But I am nothing
compared to what these people

40:06.466 --> 40:09.800
have went through
and accomplished.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.942
GATES: We'd already traced
Terry Crews' maternal roots

40:15.966 --> 40:19.742
back six generations,
introducing him to ancestors

40:19.766 --> 40:22.366
who showed immense strength.

40:22.833 --> 40:26.166
Now we had a more
difficult task before us.

40:26.700 --> 40:30.209
Terry's father was abusive
and to explore his roots,

40:30.233 --> 40:33.542
we had to confront the fact
that even Terry's happiest

40:33.566 --> 40:36.366
memories of him are
tinged with sorrow.

40:38.900 --> 40:40.776
CREWS: My father
played the, the lottery.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.942
Both legal and illegal.

40:41.966 --> 40:42.976
GATES: Right.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.076
CREWS: You know he
played the numbers.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.342
GATES: The numbers.

40:45.366 --> 40:49.476
CREWS: So when he would hit was
one of the most joyous times

40:49.500 --> 40:51.542
I'll ever remember
in my household.

40:51.566 --> 40:53.676
My father would hit
and he would come home,

40:53.700 --> 40:55.576
he would wake us up,
it would be like 1:00 AM.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.042
We would always have pizza.

40:57.066 --> 41:00.342
Cause that was the only food
that was available at that time.

41:00.366 --> 41:02.442
You know, he'd bring
these pizzas, we'd smell,

41:02.466 --> 41:04.142
we'd be like, "Oh my God,
pizza hurry."

41:04.166 --> 41:05.776
You know, and we would flip out.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.676
And my mother, of course,
being very religious,

41:07.700 --> 41:11.766
gambling is not, gambling is
not allowed unless you win.

41:12.766 --> 41:15.576
My mother'd be like,
"Oh my goodness. We won."

41:15.600 --> 41:16.876
I was like, "Wait, but...

41:16.900 --> 41:19.209
Okay, I'm not even
gonna answer that."

41:19.233 --> 41:21.676
Uh, she'd come
home and he would,

41:21.700 --> 41:24.176
he would have his jacket
on and he would have all these

41:24.200 --> 41:26.909
clothes on and he would say,
"Search my pockets."

41:26.933 --> 41:28.076
GATES: Oh man.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.976
CREWS: And my mother
would go into this pocket and

41:30.000 --> 41:32.009
pull out a wad of money.

41:32.033 --> 41:33.809
And then another pocket,
another pocket.

41:33.833 --> 41:35.009
GATES: Oh.

41:35.033 --> 41:36.966
CREWS: And then...

41:43.900 --> 41:45.576
And then I would
watch them kiss.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.933
GATES: Mm-hmm.

41:48.166 --> 41:49.742
CREWS: And I remember saying,

41:49.766 --> 41:52.242
"This is just like on TV.
It's just like in the movies."

41:52.266 --> 41:53.709
GATES: Right, right.

41:53.733 --> 41:55.276
CREWS: It was, I was like,

41:55.300 --> 41:56.709
"That's my mother
and that's my father."

41:56.733 --> 41:58.942
GATES: Right.
CREWS: And they love each other.

41:58.966 --> 42:00.309
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

42:00.333 --> 42:01.576
CREWS: And we
would just sit there.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.276
We'd eat that pizza man, and...

42:03.300 --> 42:05.900
GATES: Yeah, yeah.

42:06.300 --> 42:09.609
CREWS: We would just, it
was just some of the best times

42:09.633 --> 42:11.376
I will ever remember, you know.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.509
And I was like,
"They love each other, look."

42:14.533 --> 42:16.176
GATES: Yeah, mm-hmm.
They really do love each other.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.276
CREWS: Look, they do.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.609
You know because it
was a lot of just...

42:19.633 --> 42:21.076
It was so much fighting
and so much stuff,

42:21.100 --> 42:22.109
but then those moments.

42:22.133 --> 42:24.142
I said, "This is it,
that's the ideal.

42:24.166 --> 42:27.842
That's what I want our
family to be all the time."

42:27.866 --> 42:29.176
GATES: And then you
go to sleep, it's like,

42:29.200 --> 42:30.476
"Okay, it's going
to be a new day."

42:30.500 --> 42:31.542
CREWS: That's right.

42:31.566 --> 42:32.776
GATES: "Cause everything's
gonna be better."

42:32.800 --> 42:34.209
CREWS: That's exactly it.

42:34.233 --> 42:36.266
GATES: And then, boom.
CREWS: It would go back.

42:37.133 --> 42:39.242
GATES: There's no
explaining away or excusing

42:39.266 --> 42:41.376
what Terry endured,

42:41.400 --> 42:43.876
but we soon encountered
what seemed, at least,

42:43.900 --> 42:46.442
to be one factor that
may have contributed to his

42:46.466 --> 42:48.433
father's behavior:

42:49.066 --> 42:52.100
Terry told me that his father
was estranged from his father,

42:52.700 --> 42:56.333
Terry's grandfather,
a man named Edward Crews...

42:57.366 --> 43:01.276
We found Edward in the archives
of Calhoun county Georgia,

43:01.300 --> 43:04.400
marrying Terry's
grandmother, Ermelle Smart,

43:05.400 --> 43:08.242
in November of 1943.

43:08.266 --> 43:12.809
Ermelle is still alive today
and Terry often visited her in

43:12.833 --> 43:15.133
Georgia when he was a child.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.209
But he does not recall ever
hearing her speak about Edward

43:18.233 --> 43:20.709
and as we began our research,

43:20.733 --> 43:24.200
the reason for that
silence became clear...

43:26.400 --> 43:28.933
CREWS: "State of Georgia
versus Edward Crews.

43:29.800 --> 43:32.376
Style of case, abandonment.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.600
State's witness, Ermelle Crews."

43:35.833 --> 43:38.509
GATES: In 1954, eleven years
after they were married,

43:38.533 --> 43:42.709
Ermelle sued Edward for the
abandonment of their children.

43:42.733 --> 43:43.942
CREWS: Mm-hmm.

43:43.966 --> 43:45.642
GATES: Your father would've
been about nine years old

43:45.666 --> 43:46.976
at the time.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.009
CREWS: Mm-hmm. Yeah,
my, my father never said

43:51.033 --> 43:52.342
anything about this.

43:52.366 --> 43:53.776
GATES: Mm-hmm.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.876
CREWS: My uncle Sonny,

43:55.900 --> 43:59.609
told me a little
bit about the fact that, uh,

43:59.633 --> 44:01.642
he was not around...

44:01.666 --> 44:05.366
He told me that he was
in and out of their lives.

44:05.733 --> 44:06.809
GATES: Yeah.

44:06.833 --> 44:09.142
CREWS: And he would
hardly ever showed up.

44:09.166 --> 44:11.900
Um, so that would make
the case for abandonment.

44:13.966 --> 44:15.942
GATES: In June of 1954,

44:15.966 --> 44:19.509
Terry's grandfather pleaded
guilty and was sentenced to

44:19.533 --> 44:22.876
one year at a public works camp.

44:22.900 --> 44:26.009
He was discharged after
serving about nine months,

44:26.033 --> 44:28.866
but his trouble with the
law was just beginning.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.909
Less than three years later,

44:30.933 --> 44:33.176
he was arrested again
for trying to break into

44:33.200 --> 44:36.042
a liquor store, but this time,

44:36.066 --> 44:38.100
he did not get off lightly.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.976
CREWS: "The State
versus Edward Crews.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.942
Plea of guilty to attempt
at burglary whereupon it is

44:45.966 --> 44:48.942
considered and adjudged by
the court that Edward Crews be

44:48.966 --> 44:52.809
placed and confined at
hard labor in a chain gang,

44:52.833 --> 44:56.842
upon some public works
for the term of 12 months.

44:56.866 --> 45:01.166
March 29th, 1957."

45:02.700 --> 45:04.409
CREWS: Hmm. Not good.

45:04.433 --> 45:05.742
GATES: And you've never
heard anything about this?

45:05.766 --> 45:06.809
CREWS: No.

45:06.833 --> 45:08.176
GATES: And you've
heard Sam Cooke's song

45:08.200 --> 45:10.109
"Working On A Chain Gang"
1,000 times, right?

45:10.133 --> 45:13.409
CREWS: Uh, I mean, uh, I
can go back in all the movies

45:13.433 --> 45:15.409
I've ever seen
about this kinda stuff.

45:15.433 --> 45:16.776
GATES: Yeah.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.776
CREWS: And all I can say is,
this, this stuff was real.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.309
Like a chain gang.

45:21.333 --> 45:23.642
GATES: Yeah, oh, and wearing
stripes and it was horrible.

45:23.666 --> 45:25.433
CREWS: Oh.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.809
GATES: "Chain gangs" are
part of a shameful chapter

45:28.833 --> 45:30.609
in American history.

45:30.633 --> 45:33.276
They were a form of labor that
evolved out of what was known

45:33.300 --> 45:37.909
as "convict leasing" a system
developed after slavery whereby

45:37.933 --> 45:41.842
white businessmen could
purchase prisoners to live and

45:41.866 --> 45:43.900
work under their control.

45:45.133 --> 45:48.376
When that system was
abolished in the early 1900s,

45:48.400 --> 45:52.576
chain gangs became commonplace
across the Jim Crow south and

45:52.600 --> 45:56.342
played a major role in
expanding the infrastructure of

45:56.366 --> 45:58.909
many southern states.

45:58.933 --> 46:02.442
In practice, this meant that
men like Terry's grandfather

46:02.466 --> 46:05.742
were essentially forced
to work without pay,

46:05.766 --> 46:08.276
under inhumane conditions,

46:08.300 --> 46:12.066
as a punishment for even
the most minor crimes.

46:14.766 --> 46:18.176
CREWS: Well, it's, it's
not rehabilitation.

46:18.200 --> 46:24.866
Um, I'm sure, uh, they
left a little bit more of

46:25.633 --> 46:27.409
their souls out there every day.

46:27.433 --> 46:28.642
GATES: Oh, yeah.

46:30.466 --> 46:32.109
GATES: Free labor.

46:32.133 --> 46:34.342

GATES: You got it.
CREWS: Wow.

hot it gets in Georgia?

46:41.000 --> 46:42.042
GATES: Yeah.

46:42.066 --> 46:46.009
CREWS: As a kid, the heat.
It was unbearable.

46:46.033 --> 46:48.776
There was times you
couldn't even move.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.476
GATES: How do you think
having a father in and out

46:50.500 --> 46:52.242
of jail growing up,
affected your father?

46:52.266 --> 46:54.409
It could not have not
affected your father.

46:54.433 --> 46:55.742
CREWS: Yeah.

46:55.766 --> 46:59.909
That, that right there had to
be devastating to a nine, 10,

46:59.933 --> 47:01.909
11-year-old boy.

47:01.933 --> 47:03.642
Had to be horrifying.

47:03.666 --> 47:06.042
GATES: Your uncle James
told us that the bus route

47:06.066 --> 47:08.409
that he and your father
took to get to school,

47:08.433 --> 47:13.176
passed by the prison where
their father was locked up.

47:13.200 --> 47:16.309
And that he and your dad would
visit their father on Sundays.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.476
CREWS: Oh.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.176

always promise to do better

47:20.200 --> 47:21.476
when he got out.

47:21.500 --> 47:25.309
But as your uncle stated,
he never kept his promise.

It's heartbreaking.
