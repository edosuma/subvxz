00:08.321 --> 00:10.844
This is Cat Grant,
reporting from Taipei,

00:10.969 --> 00:12.109
where the historic peace summit

00:12.177 --> 00:14.278
between South Rhelasia
and North Rhelasia

00:14.345 --> 00:16.725
has completely broken down.

00:16.891 --> 00:20.103
As a last resort, Prime Minister Tseng
of South Rhelasia

00:20.269 --> 00:22.686
and North Rhelasia's
General Singh Mann Li

00:22.754 --> 00:25.859
have agreed to bring in
an independent arbitrator.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.824
But who is it?

00:27.892 --> 00:30.494
Speculation has run from
the Secretary General of the United Nations

00:30.562 --> 00:32.195
to Superman.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.198
But the man of steel
seems unlikely,

00:34.265 --> 00:38.302
as I'm told the arbitrator
is due to arrive by car, not cape,

00:38.369 --> 00:39.903
at any moment.

00:43.374 --> 00:45.379
- Aqualad.
- Red Arrow.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.881
I need access to
the Justice League's database

00:48.047 --> 00:50.842
and the exact height of the League
of Shadows Assassin known as Cheshire.

00:51.008 --> 00:53.845
Checking.

00:56.988 --> 01:00.060
Cheshire is 1.67 meters.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.291
Um...

01:01.359 --> 01:02.688
She is 5'6".

01:02.854 --> 01:03.961
And exceptionally dangerous.

01:04.028 --> 01:05.729
Do you require back-up?

01:05.797 --> 01:08.568
Please, the last thing
I need is the Junior Justice League.

01:08.734 --> 01:11.101
Just our computer.

01:16.868 --> 01:17.994
Good luck, my friend.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.943
Aqualad out.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074

01:29.922 --> 01:32.122
The arbitrator has arrived.

01:56.614 --> 01:58.949
Did you get that?
Did you get the shot?

02:00.411 --> 02:02.581
Aah!

02:02.830 --> 02:05.292
- Yah! Yah!
- Uhh!

02:05.458 --> 02:07.090
Yah!

02:07.158 --> 02:09.359
Uhh!

02:16.267 --> 02:17.554
Uhh!

02:19.170 --> 02:22.072
Don't move.

02:25.269 --> 02:28.578
We have just witnessed
an assassination attempt live.

02:28.646 --> 02:30.547
Thankfully, no one seems
to have been hurt,

02:30.615 --> 02:33.570
including our
mystery arbitrator.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.120
Lex Luthor?

02:42.328 --> 02:48.335
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>

03:14.610 --> 03:16.610
We have confirmation.

03:16.677 --> 03:19.616
This one's
Green Arrow's pal, Speedy.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.615
It's Red Arrow now.

03:21.682 --> 03:23.286
He must be questioned.

03:23.452 --> 03:25.719
Lex Luthor vouches
for him, Captain.

03:25.787 --> 03:27.541
Release the sidekick.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.855
Ex-sidekick.

03:28.923 --> 03:31.461
And I don't need
any favors from you.

03:31.627 --> 03:33.927
Apologies.
I didn't realize you wished

03:33.995 --> 03:36.216
to join the young lady
behind bars.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.632
You may have everyone
here fooled, Luthor,

03:38.699 --> 03:40.762
but I know what you are.

03:40.928 --> 03:44.204
Oh, I don't pretend
to be an angel.

03:44.272 --> 03:49.142
It just so happens that this time
I'm on the side of the angels.

04:00.197 --> 04:03.123
The violence outside has not
helped the peace process.

04:03.191 --> 04:05.120
Hiring assassins, Li?

04:05.286 --> 04:07.093
Had you no one
among your own troops

04:07.161 --> 04:08.795
to do the North's dirty work?

04:08.863 --> 04:11.031
I need no assassins, tseng.

04:11.098 --> 04:13.545
Such is the method
of a Southern coward.

04:17.939 --> 04:19.973
Tensions are running high

04:20.041 --> 04:22.971
and troops are massing on the
border between the 2 countries.

04:23.137 --> 04:28.226
Right now, Lex Luthor seems to be
the best, or only, hope for peace.

04:28.392 --> 04:30.061
Why should either side
trust you?

04:30.227 --> 04:34.221
Because lexcorp is a company
founded on peaceful enterprise

04:34.288 --> 04:35.859
for all humanity.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.190
Cut the act, Luthor.

04:37.258 --> 04:39.493
I've got intel into
lexcorp's show companies

04:39.560 --> 04:41.528
to the sale of weapons
in both Rhelasias.

04:41.596 --> 04:43.697
You're profiting off this war.

04:43.764 --> 04:45.869
So what's your angle?

04:46.035 --> 04:48.235
War income is pocket change

04:48.302 --> 04:50.270
compared to the billions
to be made investing

04:50.338 --> 04:52.305
in a peaceful, united Rhelasia.

04:52.373 --> 04:54.107
And isn't it better
to have peace,

04:54.175 --> 04:58.131
even if that scoundrel
Lex Luthor profits from it?

04:58.297 --> 05:00.947
That scoundrel may not
survive to profit.

05:01.015 --> 05:02.415
Cheshire failed,

05:02.483 --> 05:04.017
but the league of shadows
won't stop

05:04.085 --> 05:06.056
until the contract
is fulfilled.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.988
Which does beg the question,

05:08.055 --> 05:09.789
who hired the League?

05:09.857 --> 05:12.520
And were you really the target?

05:12.686 --> 05:14.027
Or was your death
just a convenient way

05:14.095 --> 05:15.523
to sabotage the summit?

05:15.689 --> 05:17.859
Allow me to hire you
to find out.

05:18.025 --> 05:19.299
Your money has blood on it,

05:19.367 --> 05:21.237
and I'm not here
to make a buck.

05:21.403 --> 05:22.602
Ha ha ha.

05:22.670 --> 05:27.661
So you'll provide
your services, but for free?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.342
I could live with that, Hero.

05:29.410 --> 05:30.944
Now, excuse me,

05:31.012 --> 05:34.881
I have a hemisphere to save.

05:34.949 --> 05:36.349
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

05:36.417 --> 05:39.839
Shall we attempt some smiles
for the camera?

05:49.597 --> 05:50.934
Jealous much?

05:53.434 --> 05:54.834
All right, all right.

05:54.902 --> 05:56.439
Ready for school?

05:56.605 --> 05:58.438
I made our lunches.

05:58.506 --> 06:00.574
The first day
of a scholastic season

06:00.641 --> 06:02.943
carries great
cultural resonance.

06:03.010 --> 06:05.145
We want to wish you both well.

06:05.212 --> 06:07.280
Guess it's not
a Kryptonian thing.

06:07.348 --> 06:10.917
You may wish to change
before you depart.

06:10.985 --> 06:13.086
Ah, I spent hours
choosing this outfit.

06:13.154 --> 06:14.454
What do you think?

06:14.522 --> 06:17.924
Can M'gann M'orzz pass
as an Earth girl now?

06:17.992 --> 06:19.212
Well...

06:19.378 --> 06:22.228
Just kidding.
Meet Megan Morse.

06:22.296 --> 06:24.230
What's your new name?

06:24.298 --> 06:25.468
My what?

06:25.634 --> 06:28.234
I chose the name
John Jones for myself

06:28.302 --> 06:30.974
and suggested John Smith
for Red Tornado.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.305
You could be a John, too.

06:32.373 --> 06:33.573
Pass.

06:33.641 --> 06:36.312
Conner's always been
my favorite name.

06:38.145 --> 06:40.347
A last name will also
be required.

06:40.414 --> 06:42.944
Perhaps Kent.

06:43.110 --> 06:45.018
Oh, in memory
of Dr. Fate,

06:45.086 --> 06:47.198
the late Kent Nelson.

06:47.364 --> 06:49.951
Of course.

06:50.117 --> 06:51.625
Ok. Sure.

06:51.692 --> 06:54.260
I guess it would be
an honor or something.

06:54.328 --> 06:57.797
Well, Conner Kent,
time to change your shirt.

06:57.865 --> 07:00.934
You don't want to reveal
your identity.

07:04.805 --> 07:06.906
Will this work?

07:06.974 --> 07:09.943
Heh.
Works for me.

07:10.011 --> 07:12.679
Wait, shouldn't I be
Conner Nelson?

07:12.747 --> 07:16.616
They grow up so fast.

07:25.444 --> 07:28.228
Aren't you going to
ask me anything?

07:28.295 --> 07:29.929
I think you know
what I'm after.

07:29.997 --> 07:32.285
I do, actually.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.234
Do you?
Who hired you?

07:34.301 --> 07:36.436
Shadows.

07:36.504 --> 07:37.804
Who hired them?

07:37.872 --> 07:40.206
I don't ask.

07:40.274 --> 07:42.087
What's the end game?

07:42.253 --> 07:43.777
The peace summit
or Luther himself?

07:43.844 --> 07:48.510
2 birds, one stone.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.383
Hey, where are your
little sidekick friends?

07:50.451 --> 07:51.951
They're always fun
to play with.

07:52.019 --> 07:55.508
Especially archery girl.
I like her.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.092
She--they--aren't
in my League.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.961
And you think you're in mine?

08:02.029 --> 08:04.397
Where's Green Arrow
when you really need him?

08:04.465 --> 08:05.860
I don't.

08:06.026 --> 08:09.469
Sure about that?

08:09.537 --> 08:11.032
Oh, no.

08:15.776 --> 08:17.944
Ugh! It had to be you.

08:18.012 --> 08:20.346
Beggars can't be choosers,
little girl.

08:20.414 --> 08:22.710
Coming?

08:43.731 --> 08:44.816
Ahh.

08:49.744 --> 08:51.906
I admire persistence, but...

08:57.651 --> 08:58.872
Go, go!

09:10.731 --> 09:12.999
Are you even trying
to ditch this guy?

09:13.067 --> 09:15.001
I really hate to admit it,

09:15.069 --> 09:16.936
but he has a point.

09:22.676 --> 09:24.043
Uhh!

09:40.161 --> 09:43.396
Because I'm a professional,
I won't kill you.

09:43.464 --> 09:45.532
At least not while
we're on the job.

09:45.599 --> 09:48.001
You wouldn't have this job
if not for me.

09:48.068 --> 09:49.135
Grow up already.

09:49.203 --> 09:50.436
The evening's agenda

09:50.504 --> 09:53.006
was to create strife
between nations,

09:53.073 --> 09:56.276
not my assassins.

09:56.343 --> 09:57.844
Master.

09:57.912 --> 09:59.212
And client.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.315
So twice disappointed
in your failure.

10:02.383 --> 10:05.518
Luthor has been a thorn
in my side for too long.

10:05.586 --> 10:09.122
Peaceful countries rarely call
upon the League of Shadows.

10:09.190 --> 10:11.024
Ra's al Ghul?

10:11.091 --> 10:14.561
So I expect better outcome,

10:14.628 --> 10:17.951
less interference
from that boy.

10:19.034 --> 10:21.329
Perfect.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.874
I hear you go by Red Arrow now.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.461
Ha. More like Broken Arrow.

11:22.806 --> 11:25.059
Ah! Hey!

11:25.225 --> 11:27.395
What?

11:27.561 --> 11:28.756
Explain this.

11:28.824 --> 11:29.991
Why?

11:30.059 --> 11:31.316
What's your problem?

11:31.482 --> 11:34.862
Put my man Marvin down.

11:34.930 --> 11:39.240
I don't think
he likes my shirt.

11:42.838 --> 11:45.006
Your shirt's fine.

11:45.074 --> 11:47.909
Everyone's shirt is fine.

11:47.976 --> 11:51.279
Someone's fine.

11:51.346 --> 11:54.482
Hi. We're new.
I'm Megan Morse.

11:54.550 --> 11:55.817
This is Conner Kent.

11:55.884 --> 11:59.093
Double allitfration.
I like it.

12:02.758 --> 12:05.433
Ok, time to get
to homeroom, gang.

12:09.031 --> 12:11.666
Conner!

12:11.734 --> 12:14.469
I'm gonna...

12:14.536 --> 12:16.304
Hi, I'm Wendy.

12:16.371 --> 12:20.114
I was new last year, so I know
how hard it is to fit in.

12:20.280 --> 12:24.118
But you look like instant
bumble bee material to me.

12:24.284 --> 12:25.747
Cheerleaders.
The Bumble Bees.

12:25.814 --> 12:27.315
Tryouts are after school.

12:28.650 --> 12:31.652
Thanks.
I'll be there.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.712
Dude, facing down Mal Duncan?

12:34.878 --> 12:35.890
Fierce!

12:35.958 --> 12:37.959
Not too bright, but fierce.

12:48.303 --> 12:49.704
Uhh!

13:22.271 --> 13:23.671
It's me.

13:23.739 --> 13:29.010
I may possibly
be in over my head.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.883
The League of Shadows
wants you dead.

13:35.951 --> 13:37.351
Doesn't every League?

13:37.419 --> 13:39.787
It's not just Cheshire,
it's Sportsmaster

13:39.855 --> 13:41.455
and Ra's al Ghul himself.

13:41.523 --> 13:43.324
I can't say I'm surprised.

13:43.392 --> 13:46.200
Ra's is something of
a competitor of mine.

13:46.366 --> 13:47.495
Then maybe I should stand aside

13:47.563 --> 13:48.963
and watch you two
take each other out.

13:49.031 --> 13:52.667
Your stab at pragmatism
is, well, adorable,

13:52.734 --> 13:55.837
but the summit and the peace
are at stake. Remember?

13:55.904 --> 13:57.605
We'll increase security.

13:57.673 --> 14:00.441
Though, if the Shadows
think you're dead,

14:00.509 --> 14:02.300
maybe we can surprise them.

14:02.466 --> 14:05.346
I've got a better surprise.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.975
If Lex Luthor's unknown
strategy for peace fails,

14:11.141 --> 14:15.389
the 2 Rhelasias are looking at
all-out war before morning.

14:15.457 --> 14:18.226
Who can tell me more
about Rhelasia?

14:18.293 --> 14:19.360
Marvin?

14:19.428 --> 14:21.796
Well, Mr. Carr, it's...

14:21.864 --> 14:23.564
Better than Fakeasia.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.435
Anyone else?

14:27.502 --> 14:30.137
Modern Rhelasia
was created in 1855

14:30.205 --> 14:31.606
and ruled by
the Boquoon Dynasty

14:31.673 --> 14:33.407
until it was divided
by the Great Powers

14:33.475 --> 14:36.077
into North and South Rhelasia
after World War II.

14:36.144 --> 14:38.079
Very good.

14:38.146 --> 14:39.547
But why are they fighting?

14:39.615 --> 14:41.115
They're all humans.

14:41.183 --> 14:43.584
I mean, Rhelasians. Right?

14:43.652 --> 14:45.286
Right on both counts, actually.

14:45.354 --> 14:47.255
It's no different on Mars.

14:47.322 --> 14:50.992
The White Martian minority are
treated as second class citizens

14:51.059 --> 14:52.326
by the Green majority.

14:52.394 --> 14:53.527
Of course, I'm green,

14:53.595 --> 14:55.561
but that doesn't make it right.

14:59.935 --> 15:02.036
The unification is unthinkable!

15:02.104 --> 15:04.839
Our peoples no longer
have anything in common.

15:04.907 --> 15:07.642
Gentlemen,
this is mere rhetoric.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.377
Despite your differences,

15:09.444 --> 15:11.846
you still share an appreciation
for many things,

15:11.914 --> 15:16.374
such as the exquisite art
of the Rhelasian tea ceremony.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.628
That is far enough...

15:20.794 --> 15:22.089
Cheshire.

15:26.995 --> 15:28.719
- Yah!
- Aah!

15:34.069 --> 15:35.893
That is far enough...

15:36.143 --> 15:37.436
Cheshire.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.632
Uhh!

16:05.047 --> 16:06.716
It's over, Cheshire.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.050
You would think so.

16:20.249 --> 16:21.449
Take Sportsmaster.

16:21.517 --> 16:22.884
Cheshire's mine.

16:22.951 --> 16:26.319
So territorial,
and only our third date.

16:30.259 --> 16:32.660
Uhh!

16:34.463 --> 16:36.764
Ahh!
Ahh!

16:47.810 --> 16:50.144
You called one of
your little sidekick friends.

16:50.212 --> 16:52.980
But didn't you tell me
they weren't in your League?

16:53.048 --> 16:54.597
Uhh!

17:10.632 --> 17:12.990
Ok, Megan, you're up.

17:14.403 --> 17:17.372
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

17:17.439 --> 17:20.208
Hornets, hornets,
can't be beat.

17:20.275 --> 17:21.776
Bzz-ting.

17:21.844 --> 17:24.627
Ow!

17:31.286 --> 17:32.854
How'd I do?

17:32.921 --> 17:34.655
I thought you did great.

17:34.723 --> 17:37.125
And I'm really sorry
about this.

17:37.192 --> 17:38.559
Ahh!

17:38.627 --> 17:40.061
Grr.

17:40.129 --> 17:41.796
Conner, no!

17:41.864 --> 17:44.732
Uhh! Ahh!

17:44.800 --> 17:48.136
Sorry. It's a stupid
initiation ritual

17:48.203 --> 17:50.972
that I wish my teammates
would abandon.

17:51.039 --> 17:53.975
Wait. Initiation ritual?

17:54.042 --> 17:55.610
Hello, Megan.

17:55.677 --> 17:57.478
That means I made the team.

17:57.546 --> 17:59.247
Um, I did, right?

17:59.314 --> 18:01.664
You're a Bumble Bee, girl.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.050
Thank you! Thank you!

18:03.118 --> 18:04.318
Thank you!

18:04.386 --> 18:06.220
So, is that your boyfriend?

18:06.288 --> 18:09.824
'Cause he's hot,
but kind of a freak.

18:13.796 --> 18:15.496
You're carrying my books?

18:15.564 --> 18:18.514
What, you want them to get wet?

18:34.616 --> 18:35.817
Not bad, Lad.

18:35.884 --> 18:38.286
Better than your team did
at Santa Prisca

18:38.353 --> 18:40.021
- and Bialya.
- How did you--

18:40.088 --> 18:42.757
Let's just say I have
an inside source.

18:42.825 --> 18:44.957
Very inside.

18:48.931 --> 18:50.629
Aqualad, let's end this.

19:02.849 --> 19:04.935
Ahh!

19:17.960 --> 19:20.061
Aah!

19:20.128 --> 19:22.029
Mercy.

19:23.665 --> 19:25.956
Uhh!

19:31.340 --> 19:34.675
Gives new meaning
to the arms race, doesn't she?

19:36.078 --> 19:38.546
That technology
is most impressive.

19:38.614 --> 19:40.638
We owe you our lives, sir.

19:42.517 --> 19:44.725
They owe him their lives?

19:44.891 --> 19:47.812
Yes, quite a coup
for Lex Luthor.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.057
Under his leadership,
North and South Rhelasia

19:50.125 --> 19:51.398
are signing a treaty,

19:51.564 --> 19:54.795
which could eventually lead
to reunification.

19:57.737 --> 20:00.634
I can't believe we just
did a solid for Lex Luthor.

20:00.702 --> 20:02.703
Not for Luthor, for peace.

20:02.771 --> 20:05.473
Beyond that, if Ra's
and the League of Shadows

20:05.540 --> 20:07.074
wanted to sabotage the summit,

20:07.142 --> 20:10.501
the signing of the treaty
renders their contract moot.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.480
It is over.
Is it?

20:12.547 --> 20:14.839
I heard what Sportsmaster said.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.984
Do you really think
there's a mole on your team

20:17.052 --> 20:18.352
feeding him intel?

20:18.420 --> 20:20.755
I cannot rule out
the possibility.

20:20.822 --> 20:24.557
I will investigate quietly.
Not tell them?

20:24.723 --> 20:28.095
I don't not want the unit unraveling
over baseless suspicions.

20:28.163 --> 20:29.728
And if there is a mole,

20:29.894 --> 20:32.815
I have no wish to tip
him or her off.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.234
Good luck with that.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.837
One moment, my friend.

20:36.905 --> 20:39.540
Tonight you could have
called Green Arrow for help,

20:39.608 --> 20:41.031
or the Justice League.

20:41.197 --> 20:44.278
Instead, your first instinct
was to call the cave.

20:44.346 --> 20:45.880
You're right.

20:45.947 --> 20:50.207
The team deserves...
Has my respect.

20:50.373 --> 20:52.553
I'm still getting used to
this solo act stuff,

20:52.621 --> 20:53.878
but if you need me,

20:54.044 --> 20:55.671
I'll be there.

21:00.762 --> 21:02.596
That went well.

21:02.664 --> 21:07.266
Both Li and Tseng were quite
impressed with Mercy's equipment

21:07.432 --> 21:11.228
and are quite literally
buying into the peace.

21:11.394 --> 21:15.476
How plan to ensure the eventual
reunification of Rhelasia

21:15.544 --> 21:19.947
under Lexcorp's political
and economic guidance

21:20.015 --> 21:21.697
is a success.

21:21.863 --> 21:25.242
And thus, another
corner of the world

21:25.408 --> 21:28.122
sees the light.
