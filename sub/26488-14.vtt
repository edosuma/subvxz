of student-led protesters</i>

02:09.597 --> 02:12.276
have begun calling for
President Sandino to step down,

02:12.300 --> 02:14.946
and he's been responding
with brutal violence.

02:14.970 --> 02:17.415
Hundreds of civilians have
already been arrested or killed

02:17.439 --> 02:19.984
in clashes with the police and
pro-government paramilitaries.

02:20.008 --> 02:22.787
So Sandino continues

02:22.811 --> 02:24.956
his slide into authoritarianism

02:24.980 --> 02:27.591
and the populace is teetering
on the brink of open revolt.

02:27.615 --> 02:31.095
Is about that the gist
of the situation?

02:31.119 --> 02:34.665
Well, and if Nicaragua
devolves into civil war,

02:34.689 --> 02:37.168
we could end up with the next
Syria in our own backyard.

02:37.192 --> 02:39.303
Complete with refugee crisis.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.739
<font color="#ff0000">ELIZABETH:</font> We've reached
out to President Sandino,

02:41.763 --> 02:44.508
but he's refusing to engage.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.545
- Recommendations?
- <font color="#ff0000">ELIZABETH:</font> Travel ban, to start.

02:47.569 --> 02:49.480
That'll get his attention.

02:49.504 --> 02:51.115
Hundreds of thousands
of Americans travel there

02:51.139 --> 02:53.250
every year, a travel ban
would be a significant blow

02:53.274 --> 02:54.919
to Nicaragua's economy.

02:54.943 --> 02:57.088
American business interests
in Nicaragua as well.

02:57.112 --> 02:59.457
Well, I think a little short-term pain

02:59.481 --> 03:01.592
that may incentivize Sandino

03:01.616 --> 03:04.862
to stop killing his own people...

03:04.886 --> 03:07.198
<font color="#ff0000">DALTON:</font> Relations with
Nicaragua have been a shambles

03:07.222 --> 03:10.034
since Sandino's father
was president in the '80s.

03:10.058 --> 03:12.103
I doubt that Junior would respond well

03:12.127 --> 03:15.306
to unilateral U.S. pressure.

03:15.330 --> 03:16.841
I think it's worth finding out, sir.

03:16.865 --> 03:18.376
<font color="#ff0000">DALTON:</font> Based on our track record,

03:18.400 --> 03:21.034
I'm not too comfortable with it.

03:22.971 --> 03:25.349
Well, if I could put together
a coalition of countries

03:25.373 --> 03:26.684
willing to jointly condemn

03:26.708 --> 03:28.486
and take action against Nicaragua,

03:28.510 --> 03:29.977
will the White House reconsider?

03:35.016 --> 03:36.861
Bring me a coalition with a plan,

03:36.885 --> 03:39.163
we'll see.

03:39.187 --> 03:42.867
Adele, get me a report on U.S.
business interests in Nicaragua,

03:42.891 --> 03:44.368
and I want the latest whip count

03:44.392 --> 03:45.970
on the children's health care bill.

03:45.994 --> 03:47.838
You've got a call in
to the whip's office,

03:47.862 --> 03:50.831
and Barry from Comms
is waiting in yours.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.578
<font color="#ff0000">RUSSELL:</font> That meeting was
supposed to start an hour ago.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.014
Has he been in there this entire time?

03:57.038 --> 03:58.849
We've rescheduled so many times,

03:58.873 --> 04:01.252
he thinks you're trying to avoid him.

04:01.276 --> 04:03.320
All right, five minutes,

04:03.344 --> 04:05.322
then POTUS needs me
on an urgent matter.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.590
Understood.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.860
You. With me.

04:09.884 --> 04:12.196
- I'm not avoiding you, Barry.
- I'd dispute that,

04:12.220 --> 04:13.631
but I only have a couple minutes

04:13.655 --> 04:16.000
before Adele comes in here
saying POTUS needs you.

04:16.024 --> 04:17.802
Well, then by the time she does,
it'll probably be true,

04:17.826 --> 04:19.269
- so hurry up.
- Okay, then.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.204
I've just about got you set
up on Twitter and Instagram.

04:21.228 --> 04:24.008
Wonderful. I'm delegating social media

04:24.032 --> 04:26.577
- to my intern, Stevie.
- What?

04:26.601 --> 04:28.379
I mean, uh, great,

04:28.403 --> 04:31.348
- but... what?
- Ever since that video

04:31.372 --> 04:35.219
of me yelling at that homeless
protestor lady went viral,

04:35.243 --> 04:37.855
Comms has been nagging POTUS

04:37.879 --> 04:39.490
that I need to "rehab"
my online image.

04:39.514 --> 04:41.759
Sadly, he agreed.

04:41.783 --> 04:43.761
America doesn't want a bully
in the White House,

04:43.785 --> 04:45.062
so we're gonna introduce them

04:45.086 --> 04:46.931
to the real Russell Jackson,
someone who's likable,

04:46.955 --> 04:49.366
funny, human.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.158
You know, all the traits one looks for

04:51.159 --> 04:53.370
in the president's hatchet man.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.672
Anyhow, think you can handle it?

04:54.696 --> 04:56.841
Absolutely. Yes.
Um, wh-what's involved, exactly?

04:56.865 --> 04:59.210
I'm emailing you a PDF
of the White House guidelines,

04:59.234 --> 05:00.678
but it's really pretty simple.

05:00.702 --> 05:03.147
Feel free to share posts
from other official accounts.

05:03.171 --> 05:05.683
Anything policy-intensive,
run it past me, and beyond that,

05:05.707 --> 05:09.286
focus on making the COS feel...
relatable

05:09.310 --> 05:12.079
to the average American.
And here we go.

05:13.815 --> 05:15.759
Good God, where'd you
get that picture?

05:15.783 --> 05:18.162

05:26.961 --> 05:29.507

for this opportunity.

05:35.203 --> 05:36.514

05:36.538 --> 05:38.315
It's really not.

05:38.339 --> 05:41.085

05:41.109 --> 05:42.653
strode these halls.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.088

05:44.112 --> 05:45.422
'Course you will.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.381

Hey, Shane. How are you? What's up?

05:59.928 --> 06:01.495
Hey, big brother. Just checking in,

06:01.496 --> 06:03.107
see how my little girl's doing.

06:03.131 --> 06:04.608
Sarah got to the house this morning

06:04.632 --> 06:06.644
just in time for breakfast.
It's gonna be really great

06:06.668 --> 06:08.679
to spend some time with her
before she ships out.

06:08.703 --> 06:10.381
About that, do...

06:10.405 --> 06:14.485
deployments ever get...
postponed or, uh, cancelled?

06:14.509 --> 06:17.388
Sure. But I don't think
that'll be the case with Sarah.

06:17.412 --> 06:19.290
Medical units are always in demand.

06:19.314 --> 06:20.424
She's gonna be fine, Shane.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.326
Come on, man, she's going to Iraq.

06:22.350 --> 06:24.361
To a hospital in the Green Zone.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.330
Look, things are much quieter there

06:26.354 --> 06:28.065
than they were in the bad old days.

06:28.089 --> 06:30.034
Most of her patients will be evac'd in

06:30.058 --> 06:32.036
from Syria or other parts of Iraq.

06:32.060 --> 06:34.138
It's highly unlikely that she'll be

06:34.162 --> 06:35.306
near any real combat.

06:35.330 --> 06:36.774
She put me in charge of her will,

06:36.798 --> 06:37.942
in case she is.

06:37.966 --> 06:39.210
Oh, man.

06:39.234 --> 06:41.579
<font color="#ffff00">(SIGHS)</font> Well, that's got to be hard.

06:41.603 --> 06:43.681
She chose to specialize
in trauma medicine,

06:43.705 --> 06:46.083
and she knew where
she might be deployed,

06:46.107 --> 06:48.219
and she made that brave
and noble choice anyway.

06:48.243 --> 06:51.522
Some comfort that'll be if, um...

06:51.546 --> 06:53.691
Look...

06:53.715 --> 06:55.593
can't you call in a favor?

06:55.617 --> 06:58.262
Or... just walk down the hall

06:58.286 --> 07:00.331
and ask your buddy,
the commander in chief,

07:00.355 --> 07:01.632
to change her orders? Please?

07:01.656 --> 07:02.967
You know I can't do that.

07:02.991 --> 07:05.236
Right. Professor Ethics would
never engage in something

07:05.260 --> 07:06.804
so unseemly.

07:06.828 --> 07:09.139
Did Sarah tell you
that she was concerned?

07:09.163 --> 07:10.975
She didn't have to.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.977
My gut is telling me
that she's not up for it.

07:13.001 --> 07:13.978
Hey, how about we be

07:14.002 --> 07:15.346
battle buddies?

07:15.370 --> 07:16.647

07:16.671 --> 07:18.282
you call me, and we'll
get through it together.

07:18.306 --> 07:20.351
Or you pull a few strings,
we don't have

07:20.375 --> 07:22.553
to get through at all... more
important, neither does she.

- What's Uncle Matty talking about?
- Nothing.

07:56.144 --> 07:57.454
Three.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.056
She's gonna be up there
for a chess convention.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.524
They have those?

08:00.548 --> 08:03.127
And our boy is taking the
Acela up after work to meet her.

08:03.151 --> 08:06.163
Now, because I'm his friend
and I want him to be happy,

08:06.187 --> 08:07.598
I want to make sure that
he has a sound plan.

08:07.622 --> 08:09.006
We're about to brief M-Sec.

08:09.007 --> 08:10.467
Could we not talk about this right now?
That's so great

08:10.491 --> 08:11.902
that you two have
been staying in touch!

08:11.926 --> 08:13.404
Oh, they've been more
than staying in touch.

08:13.428 --> 08:14.872
They're texting all the time,
Skyping every night...

08:14.896 --> 08:16.040
Look, I appreciate the support,

08:16.064 --> 08:18.042
but I'm trying to manage
expectations, which...

08:18.066 --> 08:19.845
also means managing the
flow of information.

08:19.869 --> 08:21.333
Okay, first of all, ouch.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.729
Okay, look, if you must know,

08:22.730 --> 08:23.914
hopefully, I'll be able
to jet out of here early.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.173
The plan is to meet up tonight
for a drink, and if that

08:26.174 --> 08:27.951
goes well we'll go out for our
official first date tomorrow.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.586
- You're staying at the same hotel?
- No, I'm trying

08:29.610 --> 08:31.488
to keep the whole thing casual,
just let it breathe.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.323
You realize for someone
trying to keep things casual,

08:33.347 --> 08:34.924
you're being incredibly
uptight right now?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.559
Also hurtful.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.895
Well, maybe that's because I'm trying

08:37.919 --> 08:39.429
to maximize the potential for success

08:39.453 --> 08:41.832
as much as my stupidly
complicated life will allow,

08:41.856 --> 08:43.133
ideally without
the whole State Department

08:43.157 --> 08:45.602
breathing down my neck,
so can we just get back to work?

08:45.626 --> 08:46.937
- Please?
- Sure.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.339
Since apparently, we're
just... work friends

17:55.664 --> 17:57.075

18:01.570 --> 18:03.748

That's pretty cool.

don't put me on a pedestal,

18:08.310 --> 18:10.488

18:10.512 --> 18:12.924
Because based on the conditions
I just saw,

18:12.948 --> 18:15.326
that girl Bethany is right
about one thing.

18:15.350 --> 18:18.396
Some of her friends
will <i>definitely</i> die.

18:18.420 --> 18:21.265
And assuming she survives,

18:21.289 --> 18:23.468
she's gonna have to live with the fact

18:23.492 --> 18:26.304
that she and her beliefs failed
to save them.

18:26.328 --> 18:29.107
So what part of that is cool,

18:29.131 --> 18:31.132
exactly?

18:33.969 --> 18:37.849
Sorry. I'm...

18:37.873 --> 18:40.985
I didn't mean to snap like that. I...

18:41.009 --> 18:43.421
Getting organized to leave
is really hectic.

18:43.445 --> 18:45.590
And I guess

18:45.614 --> 18:47.425
it's just making me tense.

18:47.449 --> 18:49.994
<font color="#ffff00">(SIGHS)</font> So...

18:50.018 --> 18:51.996

18:57.392 --> 18:59.003
with the families of the missionaries?

18:59.027 --> 19:01.806
Better than my Skype call
with their new lawyer.

19:01.830 --> 19:05.243
She's publicly calling for the
U.S. to take stronger actions

19:05.267 --> 19:07.111
against the Nicaraguan government.

19:07.135 --> 19:09.847

finally agreed to take my call.

I'm sorry this turned out to
be such a late night, ma'am.

19:12.674 --> 19:14.986
I know you wanted to
spend time with your niece.

19:15.010 --> 19:16.421
No, I'm sorry for you.

19:16.445 --> 19:19.691
I-I heard you had to cancel
a hot date up in New York?

19:19.715 --> 19:21.092
It's no big deal.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.727
I warned Annelies this could happen.

19:22.751 --> 19:24.028
Comes with the job.

Well, you're being very stoic.

19:36.865 --> 19:39.477
I am sorry that this call had to be

19:39.501 --> 19:40.845
under such dire circumstances.

19:40.869 --> 19:42.180
If you mean

19:42.204 --> 19:44.949
the terrorist coup
that is threatening my country,

19:44.973 --> 19:46.551
then I am sure you'll understand

19:46.575 --> 19:48.886
I'm a little busy right now,
Secretary McCord.

19:48.910 --> 19:51.489
You keep calling them "terrorists,"

19:51.513 --> 19:54.792
but the social media videos
being posted

19:54.816 --> 19:59.163
from inside that church show...
a group of scared kids.

19:59.187 --> 20:01.666
If you send in a negotiator

20:01.690 --> 20:05.036
to guarantee safe passage
for the wounded and due process

20:05.060 --> 20:08.306
for anyone arrested, um, I'm confident

20:08.330 --> 20:11.175
this situation could be resolved
without further violence.

20:11.199 --> 20:13.578
Is that what the U.S. would do?

20:13.602 --> 20:16.347
Hmm? Negotiate with terrorists?

20:16.371 --> 20:19.050
President Sandino,
as I'm sure you're aware,

20:19.074 --> 20:21.052
there are 14 American missionaries

20:21.076 --> 20:23.054
also trapped in that church.

20:23.078 --> 20:25.123
We want them back.

20:25.147 --> 20:26.758
Or what?

20:26.782 --> 20:28.826
Like my father before me,

20:28.850 --> 20:31.929
I refuse to be bullied by the U.S.

20:31.953 --> 20:35.032
From what I understand, your
father is currently undergoing

20:35.056 --> 20:39.137
medical treatment in Florida.

20:39.161 --> 20:41.472
Isn't it time
we learn to work together?

20:41.496 --> 20:44.709
You lost that chance when
your CIA murdered my mother.

20:44.733 --> 20:48.312
We alone shall handle
our internal affairs

20:48.336 --> 20:51.015

Maybe if I understand better
what happened to them

21:01.550 --> 21:03.795
in Nicaragua's first civil war,

21:03.819 --> 21:05.797
I can find a way to
stave off a second.

21:05.821 --> 21:07.431
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay? Thank you.

21:07.455 --> 21:09.600
- Yeah.
- I just took a call from Ephraim Ware.

21:09.624 --> 21:11.469
Intelligence has clocked
a group of Chinese operatives

21:11.493 --> 21:13.371
that they believe might be a hit squad

21:13.395 --> 21:15.273
entering Nicaragua through Costa Rica.

21:15.297 --> 21:17.408
I guess maybe China's decided

21:17.432 --> 21:20.200
that Sandino is bad
for business after all.

21:25.482 --> 21:26.598
<font color="#ff0000">ELIZABETH:</font> <i>So,</i>

21:26.599 --> 21:28.777
what do you think
is going on with Sarah?

21:28.801 --> 21:32.621
You think maybe seeing
all those wounded people

21:32.622 --> 21:36.202
near to her own age...
maybe that's shaken her up?

21:36.226 --> 21:38.838
Could be. I didn't want to get into it

21:38.862 --> 21:40.072
in front of the kids.

21:40.096 --> 21:42.608
You know, maybe
Shane's right to worry.

21:42.632 --> 21:45.101
I feel like I should talk
to her, but honestly,

21:45.125 --> 21:46.533
I don't know what to say.

21:46.534 --> 21:50.438
I mean, when I deployed, it
was to potentially take lives,

21:50.439 --> 21:52.417
and Sarah's going in to save them.

21:52.441 --> 21:55.470
Maybe you just need to let her
know that you're there for her.

21:55.471 --> 21:57.620
Maybe I should take her to see Will.

21:57.621 --> 21:59.884
Ooh, I don't know about that.

Why?

22:01.159 --> 22:02.704
He's been in combat zones.

22:02.728 --> 22:04.739
Heck, he teaches trauma medicine.

22:04.763 --> 22:06.597
He's bound to have some good advice.

22:07.599 --> 22:09.444
I love my brother.

22:09.468 --> 22:12.046
But he's got a very particular

22:12.070 --> 22:13.414
take on things.

22:13.438 --> 22:17.085
And how it's going to land
on other people...

22:17.109 --> 22:19.954
isn't usually much
of a factor in his thinking.

Well, after you downplayed
my earlier concerns

22:39.298 --> 22:42.176
about Nicaragua,
I was surprised to hear

22:42.200 --> 22:44.545
that a group of Chinese
operatives were spotted

22:44.569 --> 22:46.614
in Costa Rica near the border today.

22:47.906 --> 22:49.183

behavior has proven to be

22:51.276 --> 22:54.389
unacceptably destabilizing.

22:54.413 --> 22:56.391
To the Nicaraguan people,

22:56.415 --> 22:58.860
or to Chinese investment
in the region?

I think you're saying, Ming,

could ignite a civil war.

23:13.065 --> 23:15.243
That is exactly what
China wishes to avoid.

23:15.267 --> 23:17.345
Well, then we can still work together

23:17.369 --> 23:19.781
to negotiate with Sandino.

23:19.805 --> 23:21.716
Sandino doesn't want
to negotiate, Elizabeth.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.251
And neither do I.

23:23.275 --> 23:25.286
If the U.S. cannot bring him to heel,

23:25.310 --> 23:27.455

that oddly comforting.

27:07.766 --> 27:09.199

27:13.705 --> 27:16.417

that you had to cancel on her?

Actually, she took the
train to D.C. this morning

27:18.376 --> 27:20.254
with some chess friends,
do some sightseeing.

27:20.278 --> 27:21.956
If we can get Sandino to back down,

27:21.980 --> 27:24.091
then I'm gonna meet up with them.

27:24.115 --> 27:26.194
Why don't you sound happier
about that?

27:26.218 --> 27:28.429
Because she's in my city
having a great time,

27:28.453 --> 27:29.830
just not with me. And look.

27:29.854 --> 27:31.232
Look at her Instagram.

27:31.256 --> 27:33.057
Wh-What's the deal with that guy?

27:34.192 --> 27:35.736
He's got his arm around her
in every picture.

28:42.060 --> 28:44.672
so puzzled by your title.

28:44.696 --> 28:46.707
Tell me,

28:46.731 --> 28:48.409
when the State Department returns

28:48.433 --> 28:51.012
your dismembered corpse to Washington,

28:51.036 --> 28:52.313
will they go through the pretense

28:52.337 --> 28:54.949
of holding a memorial,

28:54.973 --> 28:58.319
or will that fall
to your comrades at the CIA?

28:58.343 --> 28:59.920
President Sandino,

28:59.944 --> 29:02.523
I came here to tell you
that the attempt on your life

29:02.547 --> 29:04.859
wasn't sanctioned
by the U.S. government.

29:04.883 --> 29:07.962
It would be unwise to
insult my intelligence.

29:07.986 --> 29:11.165
You know we've been in contact
with some of the rebel cells,

29:11.189 --> 29:13.367
but that bombing
should never have happened.

29:13.391 --> 29:16.103
For whatever part
we might have played,

29:16.127 --> 29:20.775
both my government
and I personally am truly sorry.

29:20.799 --> 29:23.044
I will tell that to my son

29:23.068 --> 29:26.814
when he's crying at night
for his dead mother.

29:26.838 --> 29:27.915
I know there's nothing I can ever do

29:27.939 --> 29:29.016
to make this right for you.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.575
Or your son.

29:31.576 --> 29:33.721

to save Nicaragua

29:33.745 --> 29:35.890

- With the United States?
- I believe

29:42.253 --> 29:43.864
- my government will back yours.
- You train rebels over our border.

29:43.888 --> 29:45.866
- You mine our harbor.
- I believe

29:45.890 --> 29:49.403
I can convince
my government to back yours.

that I should chop you

31:19.317 --> 31:22.163
Despite constant undermining
by the U.S.,

31:22.187 --> 31:24.498
he managed to do some good
for his people.

31:24.522 --> 31:28.135

he gave up power.

for a lot of the folks

31:50.014 --> 31:52.215
True enough.

31:53.184 --> 31:54.562
But my God,

31:54.586 --> 31:57.097
did we make some awful
mistakes along the way.

31:57.121 --> 32:00.234

32:00.258 --> 32:03.003
Sandino Jr. might not have
turned out to be such a monster

32:03.027 --> 32:06.173
if his mother hadn't
been killed on my watch.

32:06.197 --> 32:09.543
I understand second-guessing the past,

32:09.567 --> 32:14.782
but we are on the verge
of a disaster in Nicaragua now.

32:14.806 --> 32:18.786
Sandino Jr. is showing
no sign of backing down.

32:18.810 --> 32:21.989
And when the country finally implodes,

32:22.013 --> 32:24.325
you can bet Russia and China
will be ready to swoop in

32:24.349 --> 32:26.727
and capitalize on the chaos.

32:26.751 --> 32:31.699

37:32.498 --> 37:34.943
Yeah, major news outlets

37:34.967 --> 37:36.678
are picking this up
all over the world.

37:36.702 --> 37:38.346
Sandino Jr. will never
be able to spin this

37:38.370 --> 37:39.581
as a terrorist incident now.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.382
He won't risk opening fire
on that church

37:41.406 --> 37:43.151
with a beloved national hero inside.

37:43.175 --> 37:45.753
- So, it's over?
- Well, um, we still

37:45.777 --> 37:48.690
have to closely monitor
the situation until

37:48.714 --> 37:50.124
all those missionaries are

37:50.148 --> 37:52.861
safely back on U.S. soil, but it is

37:52.885 --> 37:57.532
no longer an "all hands
on deck" situation.

37:59.424 --> 38:01.202
What?

38:01.226 --> 38:02.337
- Imminent crisis averted, man.
- Go.

38:02.361 --> 38:03.938
- Hope has been restored. Go!
- Get out of here.

38:03.962 --> 38:05.940
- I got Chloe.
- Oh, Chloe,

38:05.964 --> 38:07.475
how would you feel
about hanging out with me

38:07.499 --> 38:09.344
- for a while? Right?
- Ooh.

38:09.368 --> 38:11.479
- Are you serious?
- Now... Oh, yeah, I am.

38:13.405 --> 38:15.316
I mean, what are you waiting for?

38:15.340 --> 38:17.285
I appreciate it, ma'am.
Seriously. Guys,

38:17.309 --> 38:19.220
I-I really do.
But I think it's pretty clear

38:19.244 --> 38:21.689
that I don't have space to date.
And even if I did,

38:21.713 --> 38:23.858
what if... what if we
don't really have a spark

38:23.882 --> 38:25.894
between us and I'm just
romanticizing a night

38:25.918 --> 38:27.795
stuck in an airport, of all places?

38:27.819 --> 38:28.963
Do you have to work

38:28.987 --> 38:30.298
- at being this pitiful? Okay.
- What?

38:30.322 --> 38:31.833
<font color="#ffff00">(LAUGHS)</font> I mean...
This may be the first time

38:31.857 --> 38:34.035
I utter these words in this office.

38:34.059 --> 38:35.570
Stop thinking! Please.

38:35.594 --> 38:37.705
Just go! You'll never know

38:37.729 --> 38:39.440
until you try. And you'll
know when you see her.

38:39.464 --> 38:41.709
- Just... come on.
- Like, right now. She's leaving

38:41.733 --> 38:42.977
- in two hours, Jay.
- Go. Get out of here.

38:43.001 --> 38:44.145
Go, Jay! Go!

38:55.547 --> 38:56.991
You wanted to see me?

38:57.015 --> 38:58.783
Sit.

39:01.086 --> 39:04.566
I'm sure you're wondering why
I called you in on a Saturday.

39:04.590 --> 39:07.101
Nope. Just happy to be here.

39:07.125 --> 39:09.604
Where I'm hopefully still welcome.

39:09.628 --> 39:11.472
I noticed that when you posted
the photos of me

39:11.496 --> 39:13.641
handing out the pandas to those kids,

39:13.665 --> 39:17.779
you also tagged the jackals
who sent me the stupid things

39:17.803 --> 39:19.314
in the first place.

39:19.338 --> 39:21.249
It made me furious.

39:21.273 --> 39:23.318
Sorry.

39:23.342 --> 39:26.788
I just thought it would be a
good way to generate publicity

39:26.812 --> 39:28.556
for the children's health care bill.

39:28.580 --> 39:29.991
Well, as it turns out,

39:30.015 --> 39:31.859
you were right.

39:31.883 --> 39:35.063
Parents around the country
put so much pressure

39:35.087 --> 39:36.931
on Morejon and the others,
they were forced to throw

39:36.955 --> 39:38.933
their support behind the bill.

39:38.957 --> 39:41.903
Looks like it's gonna pass after all.

39:41.927 --> 39:43.304
Really?

39:43.328 --> 39:44.872
It worked.

39:44.896 --> 39:48.276
Worked so well

39:48.300 --> 39:50.612
they even renamed it.

39:50.636 --> 39:52.280
The Pediatric, Adolescent,

39:52.304 --> 39:55.106

40:01.246 --> 40:03.424
Wow.

40:03.448 --> 40:05.593
You still got a lot to learn, Stevie.

40:05.617 --> 40:07.629
But...

40:07.653 --> 40:09.397
you got good instincts,

40:09.421 --> 40:10.999
and that's something
that can't be taught.

40:11.023 --> 40:13.401
So, I called you in on a Saturday

40:13.425 --> 40:15.903
to thank you for a job well done

40:15.927 --> 40:20.174
and invite you to watch
the floor vote with me.

40:20.198 --> 40:23.778
I would be honored, sir.

with his dad

- bringing him in.
- Eh, it was

40:46.224 --> 40:47.402
your idea first.

China won't be as slow
to learn as the rest of us.

about pulling the wrong
strings this time, but...

41:08.380 --> 41:11.949
there's no guarantee they
won't consider it again.
