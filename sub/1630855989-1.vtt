00:12.400 --> 00:14.480
Almost 200 years ago,

00:14.480 --> 00:18.800
whilst walking these very paths in the English countryside

00:18.800 --> 00:22.080
and observing the banks and meadows near his home,

00:22.080 --> 00:24.000
Charles Darwin developed

00:24.000 --> 00:26.600
his ground-breaking ideas about evolution,

00:26.600 --> 00:29.480
casting a new light on the natural world

00:29.480 --> 00:32.360
and opening our eyes to its true wonder.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.440
Since then, we've explored almost every part of the planet

00:37.440 --> 00:41.520
and seen nature in its astounding variety.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.360
But there's still much to discover.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.800
In this new series of Planet Earth...

00:51.320 --> 00:55.080
..we travel to the most astonishing wild places...

00:57.280 --> 00:59.960
..see mysterious creatures...

01:04.920 --> 01:07.920
..witness spectacular wonders...

01:09.920 --> 01:13.000
..and reveal breathtaking animal dramas.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.840
The natural world continues to surprise us.

01:36.200 --> 01:41.520
But since Darwin's time, it has changed beyond recognition...

01:42.720 --> 01:45.280
..transformed by a powerful force.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.560
Us.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.600
We will see how animals are adapting in extraordinary ways

01:54.600 --> 01:58.040
to survive the new challenges they face.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.000
At this crucial time in our history,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.880
we must now look at the world through a new lens.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.920
This is Planet Earth III.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.720
Tasmania, Shipstern's Bluff...

02:58.280 --> 03:00.800
..where two worlds collide.

03:23.560 --> 03:28.200
These waves have crossed more than 1,000 miles of open ocean...

03:31.000 --> 03:33.040
..building in strength.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.960
It's here that they meet their explosive end.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.680
Coasts are dangerous and dynamic frontiers.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.160
To succeed here, life must adapt to constant change.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.480
South Africa's Robberg Peninsula.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.360
Thousands of Cape fur seals gather here to breed.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.280
This pup was born into a crowded world.

05:05.560 --> 05:10.760
But now, at nearly a year old, he can escape to the water.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.280
He just has to get there.

05:51.800 --> 05:56.360
There is no question as to where this pup belongs.

06:04.640 --> 06:08.560
In the water, he's fast and agile.

06:21.320 --> 06:23.560
And he needs to be.

06:27.240 --> 06:31.800
The rolling surf conceals life-threatening dangers.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.000
A great white shark.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.560
This young pup has had a very lucky escape.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.880
Here on Africa's southern coast,

07:48.880 --> 07:53.000
seals risk their lives every time they set out to eat.

07:59.760 --> 08:03.800
Powerful ocean currents attract huge shoals of fish.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.240
But in recent years,

08:15.240 --> 08:19.880
this stretch has attracted increased numbers of great whites too.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.520
The great whites are shrewd hunters and use whatever cover is available.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.680
This shark won't need to eat for another few days.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.800
But he's not alone.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.240
These usually solitary hunters

09:14.240 --> 09:17.640
are gathering in unprecedented numbers.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.000
A dozen at a time.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.200
The seals are nimble...

09:42.120 --> 09:44.280
..but great whites are patient...

09:50.840 --> 09:53.120
..and have explosive acceleration...

09:56.400 --> 10:00.360
..hitting top speed with just five swipes of their tails.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.920
Cornered...

10:13.920 --> 10:16.880
..the seals keep close to the jagged cliffs.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.280
They are trapped.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.400
But as the great whites move in for the kill...

11:14.360 --> 11:17.240
..the seals do something astonishing.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.640
Together...

11:23.920 --> 11:26.080
..they turn on their enemy.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.920
As more join, the mob grows...

11:43.800 --> 11:46.640
..in both number and confidence.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.200
The tables are turning.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.920
By sheer force of numbers...

12:30.880 --> 12:34.760
..these fur seals drive the world's most notorious predator...

12:37.160 --> 12:39.280
..back out to sea.

12:46.960 --> 12:51.200
Here, animals are adapting to new challenges

12:51.200 --> 12:53.440
in a rapidly changing world.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.440
In the Arctic...

13:04.520 --> 13:07.800
..monumental change is a regular event.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.560
Summer.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.960
Visitors are arriving en masse...

13:21.240 --> 13:25.360
..attracted by the biggest seasonal transformation

13:25.360 --> 13:27.240
on any coast on Earth.

13:37.960 --> 13:42.520
Over 300 billion tonnes of ice are melting...

13:47.440 --> 13:50.240
..releasing nutrient-rich water.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.960
Extraordinary newcomers appear from the depths.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.160
A sea angel.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.080
No bigger than your little finger.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.600
It's eaten little for months.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.800
Its empty stomach glows orange.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.960
And there are other hungry arrivals.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.800
A sea butterfly.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.280
A snail with wings.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.960
Both angel and butterfly are blind.

15:10.400 --> 15:16.080
But each monitors minute changes in the water as they search for a meal.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.040
This angel has a devilish side.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.360
Its mouth parts invert

15:40.360 --> 15:43.280
to form a deadly trap of tentacles...

15:54.400 --> 15:57.360
..from which there is little chance of escape.

16:36.200 --> 16:40.920
With a stomach full of prey, this angel has lost its glow...

16:43.040 --> 16:45.080
..but not its appetite.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.440
It feasts while it can.

16:59.080 --> 17:03.320
Both predator and prey will soon return to the depths...

17:05.080 --> 17:08.560
..before the ice transforms this coast once again.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.320
Namibia...

17:29.320 --> 17:33.480
..where desert lions roam across vast territories.

17:42.520 --> 17:47.040
These desert cats are on a never-ending search for food.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.200
And that has brought these young sisters...

17:57.600 --> 17:59.040
..here.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.960
Africa's infamous Skeleton Coast.

18:18.360 --> 18:23.000
Following years of persecution, Namibia's lions are now protected...

18:24.200 --> 18:26.920
..and their range is expanding again.

18:28.920 --> 18:33.280
These are the first to be seen on these shores for 40 years.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.280
By day, there is little for them here.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.840
But at night, it's a different story.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.520
Sea birds come here to roost

19:00.520 --> 19:02.720
in their thousands.

19:13.080 --> 19:17.400
These hungry sisters have never seen an opportunity like this.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.640
But no cats, certainly no desert cats,

19:25.640 --> 19:27.840
enjoy getting their paws wet.

19:41.560 --> 19:46.320
These roosting cormorants are sitting ducks

19:46.320 --> 19:48.800
for hunters with good night vision.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.760
In theory.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.840
Birds are not a big cat's usual prey,

20:13.840 --> 20:15.760
let alone sea birds.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.520
And these sisters need to get their eye in.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.920
Catching flying prey in the dark is not easy...

20:58.920 --> 21:01.640
..but these lions have acquired the knack.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.640
Coasts can not only provide food...

21:21.440 --> 21:23.960
..they can also be a sanctuary.

21:37.280 --> 21:41.320
This female southern right whale is nearing the end

21:41.320 --> 21:45.280
of a 5,000 mile journey across open ocean.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.560
She's kept a steady course...

22:02.560 --> 22:06.080
..to a special place she has known all her life.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.360
Peninsula Valdes, Argentina.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.680
In these calm, shallow waters...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.440
..her behaviour starts to change.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.320
She rolls and shifts her great body.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.680
Perhaps she's trying to get comfortable.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.080
Other females are close by.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.000
Some have been coming here for five decades...

23:35.600 --> 23:40.000
..seeking the shelter of this bay at a key time in their lives.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.440
This whale is here...

24:00.600 --> 24:02.360
..to give birth.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.600
A new life begins.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.560
The calf is totally dependent on its mother.

24:53.320 --> 24:57.640
She's producing as much as 200 litres of milk a day.

25:00.120 --> 25:04.800
The strength she loses, the calf gains.

25:10.880 --> 25:16.000
And it becomes more and more independent and playful.

25:25.840 --> 25:30.160
In this nursery bay, there are plenty of playmates.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.880
But a mother never lets her calf stray too far...

25:52.320 --> 25:55.880
..and will always offer a welcome embrace.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.280
The family keeps in constant contact with whispered calls.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.000
New research has revealed

26:18.000 --> 26:23.200
that in shallow coastal waters, their calls not only fade quickly,

26:23.200 --> 26:28.200
but are also concealed by the sound of waves breaking on the shore...

26:34.200 --> 26:38.000
..so they won't attract the attention of predators.

26:43.200 --> 26:47.240
Not so long ago, these whales faced a graver threat.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.200
They were hunted to near extinction.

26:56.480 --> 27:00.880
But 40 years ago, commercial whaling was banned.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.160
Today, their population is 12,000 strong...

27:09.520 --> 27:13.120
..and this bay now attracts one of the largest gatherings

27:13.120 --> 27:15.880
of these whales anywhere on Earth.

27:37.760 --> 27:42.000
There are over a million miles of coastline around the world.

27:43.840 --> 27:48.600
Together, they constitute the most varied habitat on the planet.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.280
Here on Canada's west coast,

27:55.280 --> 27:58.880
some of the most powerful of all ocean currents

27:58.880 --> 28:01.800
deliver a constant supply of nutrients

28:01.800 --> 28:04.480
to the shores of countless islands.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.680
And those that live here take full advantage.

28:29.200 --> 28:33.880
This is the aptly-named wandering garter snake.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.040
He may seem out of place...

28:55.000 --> 28:57.160
..but he's here to eat.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.240
The water here is more than ten degrees colder than the air.

29:20.120 --> 29:25.520
But that doesn't deter this intrepid hunter from taking the plunge.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.840
Under the water, there is an abundance of food...

29:36.880 --> 29:38.920
..if he can catch it.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.000
Snakes are cold-blooded,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.440
so he can't stay in these chilly waters for long.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.240
Back in the sunshine, he warms his head,

30:22.240 --> 30:24.920
perhaps sharpening his senses.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.040
And then, with a gulp of air...

30:31.640 --> 30:33.680
..he continues his hunt.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.240
It's thought that garter snakes

30:43.240 --> 30:47.280
can use their forked tongue underwater as they do in air,

30:47.280 --> 30:50.360
smelling in stereo...

30:50.360 --> 30:53.800
..detecting prey wherever it hides.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.000
He's got something.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.160
A small fish.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.400
Now, he has to land it.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.040
Success.

31:32.200 --> 31:36.800
For those animals able to cross the divide between land and sea,

31:36.800 --> 31:39.280
there are surprising rewards.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.680
Raja Ampat in Indonesia.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.640
Here, there's a greater variety of animals

31:55.640 --> 31:58.240
than on any other coast on Earth.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.080
The corals are protected by mangroves.

32:08.440 --> 32:14.240
Salt tolerant trees that prop themselves on curving aerial roots.

32:27.400 --> 32:32.240
These fish have learned how to catch prey from high in the trees.

32:38.560 --> 32:42.400
Archerfish use jets of water like arrows.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.680
This pinpoint accuracy...

32:49.880 --> 32:52.520
..requires some complex calculations.

32:54.880 --> 32:58.360
The hunter first estimates the range of its target...

33:01.520 --> 33:04.880
..then loads with a precise amount of water.

33:07.400 --> 33:11.400
Aiming, they allow for the refraction and distortion

33:11.400 --> 33:14.120
created by the water's moving surface.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.600
And then...

33:20.800 --> 33:22.320
..release...

33:24.800 --> 33:26.680
..an arrow of water.

33:29.160 --> 33:33.960
They can hit prey up to two metres above them.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.280
But they're not born with this skill.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.080
They have to learn it.

33:52.120 --> 33:55.160
And they do that by studying others.

34:00.440 --> 34:04.840
This youngster is watching a master at work.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.920
It's time for the apprentice to have a go.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.760
First, he must select a target.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.880
This seems rather ambitious.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.520
Missed.

34:47.040 --> 34:50.000
Others watch to learn from his mistakes.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.000
Or...

35:03.400 --> 35:05.560
..to steal his prize.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.640
Enough is enough.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.560
There is one way to beat the thieves.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.080
The archer himself...

35:57.720 --> 35:59.400
..becomes the arrow.

36:20.760 --> 36:25.000
Mangroves are unusually stable coastal environments,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.960
where an archerfish can focus on beating the competition.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.920
But on the exposed coast of Mexico's Yucatan,

36:52.920 --> 36:55.000
life is precarious.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.800
Concentrated by the tropical sunshine,

37:00.800 --> 37:05.920
the brine in these shallow lagoons cannot be tolerated by most animals.

37:10.400 --> 37:14.080
And yet, these Caribbean flamingos

37:14.080 --> 37:17.440
have flown hundreds of miles to gather here.

37:53.440 --> 37:57.760
These hypersaline waters keep many predators at bay...

38:01.040 --> 38:03.600
..so it's here they choose to nest.

38:06.880 --> 38:10.000
There are more than 10,000 pairs here.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.400
It's the largest breeding colony in North America.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.640
Nest mounds keep chicks clear of the brine

38:30.640 --> 38:33.280
while they are still at their most vulnerable.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.760
But this generation faces a problem.

39:21.120 --> 39:26.040
The storms that come each season are arriving earlier every year.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.640
And the colony lies directly in their path.

39:43.960 --> 39:47.520
Rising winds create a storm surge

39:47.520 --> 39:51.280
that overwhelms the most exposed nests.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.760
And then...

40:16.840 --> 40:18.360
..it rains.

40:26.480 --> 40:30.520
The adults do what they can, bailing out their nests.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.040
But they can only do so much.

40:56.840 --> 41:01.880
The storm passes, but leaves devastation in its wake.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.040
Most nests are submerged.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.240
The chicks are soaked and cold...

41:29.960 --> 41:31.640
..and will soon perish...

41:32.880 --> 41:35.240
..unless they can get out of the water.

41:49.360 --> 41:52.000
The adults are unable to help.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.080
A chick must save itself.

42:25.560 --> 42:30.160
Some years, no chicks survive in this colony.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.600
Our coasts are vulnerable places.

42:38.440 --> 42:43.920
Increasingly so, as rising global temperatures create bigger storms.

42:48.080 --> 42:51.280
The biggest are hurricanes.

42:55.200 --> 42:59.920
They form over warm tropical water, building in strength at sea.

43:03.880 --> 43:08.000
But their full force is unleashed on our coasts...

43:10.800 --> 43:15.880
..where 40% of the world's human population have made their homes.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.160
In this changing world...

43:32.800 --> 43:35.240
..coasts are on the front line.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.400
Raine Island.

43:54.640 --> 43:57.720
One of the planet's most important breeding sites

43:57.720 --> 44:00.960
for one particularly precious species.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.240
The green turtle.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.400
On a few special nights each year,

44:23.400 --> 44:27.640
as many as 20,000 females come ashore here.

44:30.440 --> 44:32.720
Their instinct to nest is strong...

44:35.160 --> 44:40.920
..and many haul themselves far inland in search of nesting space.

44:43.680 --> 44:49.200
In a single night, they may lay as many as two million eggs.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.400
Dawn.

45:06.480 --> 45:09.560
This exhausted female has nested,

45:09.560 --> 45:12.840
but now she faces a long return journey

45:12.840 --> 45:15.160
through the dunes to the sea.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.160
As the sun rises...

45:32.480 --> 45:35.760
..she's at risk of being baked alive.

45:43.640 --> 45:47.560
Every inch she travels is gruelling.

45:55.880 --> 46:00.000
And the ebbing tide has exposed a rocky reef.

46:04.920 --> 46:07.840
It has already claimed many lives.

46:12.800 --> 46:17.120
Other females overcome by heat and exhaustion.

46:27.080 --> 46:28.840
Her temperature is rising.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.840
She has to keep going.

46:56.840 --> 47:02.680
As many as 2,000 female turtles may die here each year.

47:24.560 --> 47:27.120
But the coast is always changing.

47:36.960 --> 47:39.840
And the turning tide

47:39.840 --> 47:41.760
may yet save her.

48:10.480 --> 48:15.440
Half of all the green turtles in the Pacific come here to nest,

48:15.440 --> 48:19.120
as they have done for at least 1,000 years.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.240
But for how much longer?

48:36.160 --> 48:41.160
If sea levels rise as predicted, within the next 30 years,

48:41.160 --> 48:45.520
Raine Island will disappear beneath the waves.

48:53.400 --> 48:57.240
Coasts are dynamic, dangerous frontiers...

48:59.440 --> 49:03.880
..and they are changing faster than ever before in human history.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.040
Life is remarkably resilient...

49:11.440 --> 49:13.960
..and adapts to new challenges.

49:16.720 --> 49:21.280
But there is a limit on how fast it can do so.

49:42.520 --> 49:44.280
As far as I know,

49:44.280 --> 49:49.280
I was one of the first people to film on Raine Island, back in 1957.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.200
YOUNGER DAVID: After a fortnight of travelling north,

49:54.200 --> 49:56.480
we at last sighted Raine Island.

49:57.760 --> 50:02.840
From the sea, it looked no more than a low sandbank covered in scrub.

50:02.840 --> 50:05.480
But as we rowed ashore,

50:05.480 --> 50:09.560
we were deafened by the cries of thousands of sea birds

50:09.560 --> 50:12.480
which hung above the island like a black cloud.

50:15.800 --> 50:20.680
I was 31 and it was here that I first met a green turtle.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.800
The turtles come up to lay at night,

50:24.800 --> 50:28.840
and after a night spent laying maybe over 100 eggs,

50:28.840 --> 50:33.000
she's very weary and very anxious to get back to the sea.

50:36.480 --> 50:38.440
Nearly 70 years later,

50:38.440 --> 50:41.720
the Planet Earth III team are welcomed by people

50:41.720 --> 50:45.960
whose connection to the island goes back very much further than mine.

50:45.960 --> 50:47.720
Welcome to Raine!

50:47.720 --> 50:49.800
The Wuthathi and Meriam people

50:49.800 --> 50:52.760
have been coming here for several thousand years.

50:54.480 --> 50:56.840
Raine Island's a beautiful and special place.

50:56.840 --> 50:59.360
Like, there's nowhere else on the planet

50:59.360 --> 51:01.840
where you come and see this much turtles.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.640
It's a wonder to see.

51:07.320 --> 51:10.600
Since I was there, it's been discovered that Raine Island

51:10.600 --> 51:14.760
attracts more nesting green turtles than anywhere else on the planet.

51:20.960 --> 51:22.600
There's so many, isn't there?

51:22.600 --> 51:25.480
As soon as you're up, you're like, "Oh, there are a lot."

51:25.480 --> 51:28.360
And the crew soon meet some other residents too.

51:29.600 --> 51:31.600
This is behind the behind the scenes!

51:36.520 --> 51:37.880
See you, mate!

51:41.400 --> 51:43.360
The team are here to record

51:43.360 --> 51:46.400
the mother turtles' perilous journeys back to the sea.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.240
Oh, God.

51:52.560 --> 51:55.160
Trapped turtles can often free themselves

51:55.160 --> 51:57.360
with the help of the rising tide.

51:58.600 --> 52:01.840
Nearly. Just a bit more to the right there. Yeah, there.

52:01.840 --> 52:05.920
But in this case, Keron makes the decision to intervene.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.920
Ready? One, two, three.

52:09.920 --> 52:12.520
Yeah, any time we're here we'll walk the beach.

52:12.520 --> 52:16.200
Any turtles that have no chance of making it back to the ocean,

52:16.200 --> 52:21.320
if we can save them, we save them, because every turtle is precious.

52:21.320 --> 52:23.440
At the time of my first visit,

52:23.440 --> 52:26.800
little was known to outsiders about Raine Island.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.960
But for the last few decades,

52:28.960 --> 52:33.000
scientists have been working with the Wuthathi and Meriam people

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
to understand more about this special place.

52:36.960 --> 52:40.280
Scientists have been coming to Raine Island since about the mid '70s

52:40.280 --> 52:42.840
and over that time they've been monitoring

52:42.840 --> 52:44.760
the nesting population here.

52:46.320 --> 52:48.360
This work involves long hours...

52:50.360 --> 52:52.240
98.7.

52:52.240 --> 52:54.720
..and a certain degree of patience.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.480
Oh!

52:58.480 --> 52:59.640
SHE LAUGHS

53:03.480 --> 53:07.040
We're going to be wearing half of Raine Island by the end of tonight!

53:09.720 --> 53:13.200
Helping the year's first hatchlings is a little easier.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.560
So we'll take these ones down to the water's edge

53:16.560 --> 53:18.840
and so hopefully we'll see these turtles back here,

53:18.840 --> 53:20.480
laying eggs in 30 years' time.

53:21.760 --> 53:24.360
With the help of this dedicated team,

53:24.360 --> 53:28.040
Raine Island's turtles might seem to have a good future.

53:32.920 --> 53:36.040
But research is revealing a hidden threat.

53:40.720 --> 53:43.480
The direct effects of climate change.

53:47.680 --> 53:51.280
Do you want to hold this against the flat part of the data-logger?

53:51.280 --> 53:53.360
A developing turtle's sex

53:53.360 --> 53:56.320
is determined by the temperature of its nest.

53:57.720 --> 54:01.280
Higher temperatures produce female hatchlings.

54:03.120 --> 54:07.680
The temperature of the sand on Raine Island is now at a record high.

54:08.960 --> 54:13.600
So 99% of the turtles that hatch here are female.

54:15.040 --> 54:18.400
More alarmingly, we now know this has been case

54:18.400 --> 54:20.880
for at least the last 20 years.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.640
You do the maths.

54:23.640 --> 54:28.000
All females, no males. What's going to happen?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.240
There's going to be a population crash

54:30.240 --> 54:31.880
and there'll be no more turtle.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.520
Work is under way to find solutions.

54:38.520 --> 54:40.600
But that's not their only problem.

54:42.200 --> 54:46.720
Not only are temperatures rising, sea levels are too.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.920
Increasingly, high tides on Raine

54:50.920 --> 54:54.040
are flooding many of the nests from below...

54:56.240 --> 54:59.880
..drowning the developing turtles before they hatch.

55:01.640 --> 55:03.080
It's really upsetting.

55:03.080 --> 55:06.120
You'll dig down to check to see success,

55:06.120 --> 55:08.400
and you get down to the nests

55:08.400 --> 55:10.680
and you're just pulling up dead eggs.

55:12.360 --> 55:16.960
To try to stop this happening, they have devised a heavy-duty solution.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.880
These machines have been shipped hundreds of miles

55:24.880 --> 55:28.400
from the Australian mainland to re-shape the beach.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.520
They have already shifted sand

55:33.520 --> 55:36.920
that would fill 16 Olympic-sized swimming pools

55:36.920 --> 55:39.960
and doubled the number of safe nesting sites.

55:42.440 --> 55:46.920
The hope is that this will ensure that over five million more eggs

55:46.920 --> 55:48.920
will hatch in the next decade.

55:52.200 --> 55:57.520
But from then on, the future of Raine Island looks very uncertain.

55:58.800 --> 56:02.040
At this stage, we think that we have to about 2050

56:02.040 --> 56:05.080
until we start seeing massive impacts of sea level rise.

56:06.040 --> 56:10.440
It's crazy to think that, you know, the work that we do here,

56:10.440 --> 56:12.600
someone might not be doing this in 30 years' time

56:12.600 --> 56:14.200
cos there's no island to do it on.

56:17.920 --> 56:23.280
What sort of world is it going to be for my children and their children?

56:23.280 --> 56:25.120
Is there going to be anything for...

56:26.480 --> 56:28.160
..for them? Or is it...

56:29.600 --> 56:31.040
..all in vain?

56:36.200 --> 56:39.920
We'll always be here fighting for Raine Island, for the turtles.

56:39.920 --> 56:43.760
But we can't do it alone and we need government and big business

56:43.760 --> 56:47.760
to wake up and see what they're doing to the planet and get real.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.200
This little fellow is newly hatched from an egg

56:57.200 --> 56:59.480
which had been laid a month or so earlier

56:59.480 --> 57:02.440
and he too is very anxious to get down to the sea.

57:06.640 --> 57:09.320
Having at last successfully reached the water,

57:09.320 --> 57:13.120
he's still got a great number of hazards to face before he grows up.

57:15.520 --> 57:17.360
Little did I know then

57:17.360 --> 57:20.400
what hazards that little turtle would have to face

57:20.400 --> 57:23.960
or the extraordinary lengths to which people would go

57:23.960 --> 57:26.280
to protect it and its island.

57:27.800 --> 57:33.000
In the 66 years since my visit, Raine Island has remained

57:33.000 --> 57:36.440
the most important green turtle nesting site on the planet.

57:37.400 --> 57:41.240
The question is, can it last another lifetime?

57:46.200 --> 57:47.680
Next time...

57:49.000 --> 57:51.880
..an extraordinary journey through the ocean.

57:54.080 --> 57:57.240
The last unexplored frontier on our planet...

58:01.280 --> 58:02.880
..where life has evolved...

58:04.200 --> 58:06.640
..in the most surprising ways.
