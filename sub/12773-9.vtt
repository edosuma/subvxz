<i>Previously on</i>
<i>Beauty & the Beast...</i>

00:01.640 --> 00:02.676
<i>Vincent, don't!</i>

00:03.682 --> 00:05.283
No.
(Vincent gasps)

00:05.384 --> 00:06.817
<i>DHS is everywhere</i>
<i>looking for you.</i>

00:06.918 --> 00:08.352
You killed
the deputy secretary.

00:08.453 --> 00:10.821
Grace Rose. I'm investigating
Deputy Secretary Hill.

00:10.922 --> 00:12.523
You worked for him, right?
No comment.

00:12.624 --> 00:14.692
You Kane?
Yeah.

00:14.793 --> 00:17.762
<i>Graydal Securities is the one</i>
<i>behind the beast bounty.</i>

00:17.863 --> 00:19.830
That's where I'm going next.
Graydal is not just your

00:19.931 --> 00:21.766
everyday security firm. They're
<i>like Blackwater on steroids.</i>

00:21.867 --> 00:24.769
(groaning)
I'm here to see his boss.

00:24.870 --> 00:26.804
Someone, somehow is always
after Vincent, but he's also

00:26.905 --> 00:29.840
running from Homeland Security,
and you're enabling him.

00:29.941 --> 00:32.009
Enabling?
Cat, you're breaking the law.

00:32.110 --> 00:34.312
This is too risky.
We have to figure this out

00:34.413 --> 00:37.481
fast, because I can't
keep living like this.

00:39.951 --> 00:41.385
(sirens blaring)

00:41.486 --> 00:45.489
(helicopter whirring)

00:47.059 --> 00:49.160
(whirring)

00:53.398 --> 00:55.900
(gasps)
Looking for someone?

00:56.001 --> 00:58.803
We have
to stop meeting like this.

00:58.904 --> 01:00.237
Yeah, I know.

01:00.339 --> 01:01.706
You sure it's
safe up here?

01:01.807 --> 01:04.742
No drones?
Safe enough for a kiss.

01:04.843 --> 01:06.744
(laughs)
Mmm.

01:07.946 --> 01:10.181
Hey.
Yeah.

01:10.282 --> 01:12.249
Mmm. Mmm.

01:16.355 --> 01:18.756
Better?
Better.

01:18.857 --> 01:21.192
Hmm.
I opened a bottle.

01:21.293 --> 01:23.361
Oh, well, either
it is really safe,

01:23.462 --> 01:25.596
or you've finally had
enough of saving my ass

01:25.697 --> 01:27.998
and secretly hoping you'll get me busted.
(laughs)

01:28.100 --> 01:30.768
You figured me out.

01:30.869 --> 01:32.103
Here.
Thanks.

01:32.204 --> 01:35.773
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:35.874 --> 01:38.075
Just in case,
I'm gonna...

01:38.176 --> 01:40.611
Uh-uh. No, I'm telling
you, I maneuvered all

01:40.712 --> 01:42.680
the spying eyes away
from here. That'll teach

01:42.781 --> 01:44.922
DHS, putting me
in charge of finding you.

01:44.923 --> 01:48.126
Yeah. Well, at least now
that we're both on the inside,

01:48.127 --> 01:51.630
we're one step closer
to getting our lives back.

01:51.730 --> 01:52.992
And soon.

01:53.517 --> 01:54.764
Soon?

01:54.766 --> 01:57.635
Very soon. Look,
Graydal has just put me

01:57.735 --> 01:59.095
on the hit squad
to find the beast.

01:59.136 --> 02:00.904
Good news, right?

02:01.005 --> 02:02.372
Um, how is this
good news, exactly?

02:02.473 --> 02:05.742
Okay, don't think hit.
Think, uh, more elite.

02:05.843 --> 02:07.343
All right, the point is,

02:07.444 --> 02:09.579
whoever hired Graydal--
they've upped the pressure.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.981
They want a beast, and they want
a beast right now.

02:12.082 --> 02:14.517
Yeah, not reassured.

02:14.618 --> 02:16.586
You are the beast that they're
looking for, so, technically,

02:16.687 --> 02:20.056
that would mean they'd have to
find you to find that beast.

02:20.157 --> 02:22.659
Not if I find out who's behind
the bounty first, right?

02:22.761 --> 02:24.309
At least I'll know
what I'm up against.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.026
And then what?

02:25.030 --> 02:27.731
I don't know. I'll figure out
what they're after me for.

02:27.831 --> 02:29.666
Then I'll probably
kick their butts,

02:29.768 --> 02:32.736
and then, I'll rip their hearts
out. The usual.

02:32.836 --> 02:34.537
The usual?
Come on. I'm joking.

02:34.638 --> 02:37.540
It's not funny.
I know.

02:37.641 --> 02:40.743
Vincent, it shouldn't be this
hard for us to be together

02:40.844 --> 02:42.512
after everything
we've been through.

02:42.613 --> 02:44.013
We've got to get past this.

02:44.114 --> 02:46.716
I know, and we will, okay?
We will. We are so close.

02:46.817 --> 02:49.452
I'm not just talking about this.
I'm talking about everything.

02:49.553 --> 02:52.455
Beast hunters, manhunts,
lying, hiding.

02:52.556 --> 02:55.225
We've got to put an end to
this. There's got to be a way.

02:55.326 --> 02:58.261
(phone beeps,
Vincent sighs)

03:00.464 --> 03:02.432
I got to go. I'm sorry.

03:02.533 --> 03:05.235
The team's assembling at
the Stonefish Tavern, all right?

03:05.336 --> 03:07.776
Okay, well, I'll try and keep
the drones away from there, too.

03:07.871 --> 03:09.939
Oh, hey. Mmm.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.575
Mmm.

03:12.676 --> 03:16.145
We will find a way, I promise.

03:16.247 --> 03:18.781
(whooshing)

03:18.882 --> 03:21.517
(sighs)

03:23.153 --> 03:25.488
(computer trilling)

03:28.827 --> 03:31.962
To happily ever after.

03:32.062 --> 03:34.163
(footsteps approaching)

03:34.265 --> 03:35.965
Agent Chandler?

03:37.068 --> 03:39.403
I have a few questions.

03:39.503 --> 03:42.772
Oh, crap.

03:42.873 --> 03:45.408
Nice office.

03:45.510 --> 03:48.644
Glad to see DHS still trusts you,
all things considered.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.027
Ms. Rose, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

03:50.028 --> 03:50.874
Why is that?

03:50.898 --> 03:53.397
Because I'm not in the mood
to answer your questions.

03:53.632 --> 03:54.239
Please.

03:54.263 --> 03:56.755
Look, Agent Chandler, I'm not
here with any cameras, okay?

03:56.854 --> 04:00.256
It's just me, and I only
want to talk, off the record.

04:00.357 --> 04:02.759
No comment.

04:02.860 --> 04:04.627
I know DHS is secretly
after your husband

04:04.728 --> 04:07.096
because he killed
Deputy Secretary Hill.

04:07.197 --> 04:09.499
Nobody, of course, will
talk on the record at DHS,

04:09.600 --> 04:11.601
but I've got my sources.
Plus, it doesn't take

04:11.702 --> 04:13.369
a reporter to notice
that both Hill

04:13.470 --> 04:14.637
and your husband
mysteriously disappeared.

04:14.738 --> 04:16.839
Smells like a
cover-up to me.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.142
Friendly reminder:
you're talking to DHS now.

04:19.243 --> 04:21.611
Actually, I'm hoping
I'm talking to a wife.

04:21.712 --> 04:24.113
Because I don't get the sense
after everything I've learned

04:24.214 --> 04:26.683
that you're the type to betray
your husband, hunt him down.

04:26.784 --> 04:28.685
On the contrary.
I'm guessing

04:28.786 --> 04:30.687
you'd do everything
you could to help him,

04:30.788 --> 04:32.855
which means
you must think he's innocent.

04:32.956 --> 04:35.224
Who are you kidding?
All you care about is a story.

04:35.326 --> 04:36.486
You don't care if it's right.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.328
You just care
that it's sensational.

04:38.429 --> 04:40.997
If that were the case, I would
have already aired what I know,

04:41.098 --> 04:43.366
what I suspect.

04:43.467 --> 04:47.503
That Vincent was part of some
secret super soldier program.

04:47.604 --> 04:49.339
That Hill went
outside of DHS,

04:49.440 --> 04:51.541
possibly hired
Graydal Securities

04:51.642 --> 04:55.078
to kill your husband, but
Vincent killed him, instead.

04:55.179 --> 04:58.648
How am I doing so far?

04:58.749 --> 05:01.384
Like I said, I have my sources,
but you should know

05:01.485 --> 05:06.155
I protect my sources,
I protect their anonymity.

05:06.256 --> 05:09.092
Which means, I protect you, too.

05:09.193 --> 05:11.394
Why are you telling me this now?
Why are you here?

05:11.495 --> 05:14.063
Because I am about to air what
I know, which is, whatever's

05:14.164 --> 05:17.567
going on, your husband is
at the center of it all.

05:17.668 --> 05:19.502
I got a tip about
a secret Graydal meeting,

05:19.603 --> 05:22.071
one that, if I'm right, will
connect an awful lot of dots.

05:25.843 --> 05:27.343
One way or the other,
Agent Chandler,

05:27.444 --> 05:30.413
I am going to tell
a story, and soon.

05:30.514 --> 05:32.081
And if your husband
really is innocent,

05:32.182 --> 05:34.250
I'd think
you'd want that told, too.

05:38.489 --> 05:40.189
(door closes)

05:40.290 --> 05:42.458
(touch tones sounding)

05:42.559 --> 05:45.595
I need to talk
to Captain Vargas now.

05:48.332 --> 05:50.466
(chatter and laughter)

05:52.169 --> 05:53.936
What?

05:54.037 --> 05:56.105
(both laughing)

05:56.206 --> 05:59.208
Hey. Hi.
Hi.

05:59.309 --> 06:01.711
Um, do you have a minute?

06:01.812 --> 06:04.046
Uh, no, actually, I don't.

06:04.148 --> 06:06.983
Oh. Sorry. Sorry.
Yeah.

06:07.084 --> 06:09.252
Is this, um...?
Alex Ellis. ADA Ellis.

06:10.854 --> 06:12.789
Right. Nice to meet you.
I'm Cat.

06:12.890 --> 06:14.891
Tess and I used to be partners.

06:14.992 --> 06:17.427
Yeah, before she dumped me for DHS.
(laughs)

06:17.528 --> 06:19.762
Nice to meet you, Cat.
Uh, care to join us?

06:19.863 --> 06:22.231
No, no. No, no.
She can't. She can't.

06:22.332 --> 06:25.168
No, thank you. Although, I would
like to borrow Tess for a moment

06:25.269 --> 06:26.569
if that's
okay with you?

06:26.670 --> 06:28.938
Of course. Yes.
Um, it's urgent.

06:29.039 --> 06:30.473
Thank you.
Uh-huh.

06:30.574 --> 06:33.142
I'll be right back.
It's fine.

06:34.445 --> 06:36.245
Really? Really?

06:36.346 --> 06:38.648
Grace Rose is about to expose Vincent.
Whoa, whoa.

06:38.749 --> 06:40.008
Expose him as a fugitive,
or as a beast?

06:40.032 --> 06:41.517
Maybe both.

06:41.518 --> 06:43.853
Somehow, she knew about
the super soldier project,

06:43.954 --> 06:46.589
and that Vincent may have killed
Hill, even Graydal.

06:46.690 --> 06:50.460
If she goes public with any
of those things, we are screwed!

06:50.561 --> 06:52.641
All right, does Vincent know?
No, that's the problem.

06:52.696 --> 06:54.931
He's in a meeting with Graydal
as we speak, a meeting that,

06:55.032 --> 06:57.967
if I'm right, Grace is gonna
turn into breaking news.

06:58.068 --> 07:00.169
So, I have to get Vincent
out of there,

07:00.270 --> 07:03.506
without Graydal, DHS
or Grace getting suspicious.

07:03.607 --> 07:07.176
Tess, I just... I didn't know
who else to go to.

07:11.048 --> 07:13.282
Um...
You like him?

07:13.383 --> 07:16.853
Alex?

07:16.954 --> 07:19.288
Yeah. I mean, we've only gone
on a couple of dates.

07:19.389 --> 07:22.191
Look, you know I love
JT, but I'm sorry,

07:22.292 --> 07:25.995
it's just not a life I want
to keep living, not anymore.

07:26.096 --> 07:29.365
I can't keep doing this, Cat.
I know. Me, neither.

07:32.970 --> 07:35.938
All right, what do
you need me to do?

07:38.642 --> 07:39.976
(laughter
and overlapping chatter)

07:40.077 --> 07:42.011
MAN:
Nice going.

07:42.112 --> 07:45.414
(whooping) Hey, man, how are you?
Good to see you.

07:45.516 --> 07:47.036
MAN 2: Yeah.
WOMAN: Okay, give him one.

07:47.084 --> 07:48.584
MAN 1: You don't have a
drink, man. You want a drink?

07:48.685 --> 07:50.353
MAN 2: Can you get me one?
Yeah, yeah, what do you want?

07:50.454 --> 07:54.357
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

07:56.326 --> 07:58.594
♪ Taking all my medicine

07:58.695 --> 08:00.830
♪ To chase the feelings...

08:00.931 --> 08:04.200
♪ Oh, yeah...

08:07.437 --> 08:09.071
You're late.

08:09.172 --> 08:11.507
♪ I'll never be the same.

08:11.608 --> 08:13.576
Nice to see you, too, Kane.

08:13.677 --> 08:15.912
We already started.

08:16.013 --> 08:17.980
I'll catch up.

08:20.017 --> 08:22.552
What's the tranq gun for?
You guys gonna try and catch Bigfoot?

08:22.653 --> 08:26.022
We don't know what
we're going after exactly.

08:26.123 --> 08:28.691
This all comes from the client,
who supposedly does know.

08:28.792 --> 08:32.361
Maybe we should've invited
the client, then we would know.

08:32.462 --> 08:34.096
What? I'd like to meet him.

08:34.197 --> 08:36.765
We know enough.
We'd know more if you'd shut up.

08:36.866 --> 08:38.611
Tell me, Kane,
how's the jaw doing?

08:38.613 --> 08:40.529
Huh? Still clicking
when you talk, I see?

08:40.553 --> 08:42.138
You want to go again?

08:42.139 --> 08:43.972
All right, knock it off.
We're on the clock.

08:44.073 --> 08:46.709
Client's upped the reward to ten
mil, but now he's only giving us

08:46.810 --> 08:49.045
48 hours to find this thing.
Otherwise,

08:49.146 --> 08:51.881
we lose this contract. Intel--
they sifted through everything

08:51.982 --> 08:54.216
that the bounty hunters knew
before they were killed,

08:54.318 --> 08:58.754
and they've narrowed down
the search area to... Midtown.

08:58.855 --> 09:01.924
That's a... that's a huge area
to cover.

09:03.927 --> 09:05.595
So what else do you know
about this thing?

09:05.696 --> 09:07.096
You mean, other
than the fact he's

09:07.197 --> 09:08.898
already taken out
some of our best men?

09:08.999 --> 09:11.601
According to the client,
he's probably a military

09:11.702 --> 09:14.737
experiment gone bad.
Mutated his DNA,

09:14.838 --> 09:17.573
turned him into a freak,
or something, and apparently,

09:17.674 --> 09:20.109
he's got heightened senses--
eyesight, hearing.

09:20.210 --> 09:22.078
Superhuman strength, speed.

09:22.179 --> 09:25.014
Faster than a speeding
bullet by the sounds, huh?

09:25.115 --> 09:28.351
What do you think
the nets are for?

09:28.452 --> 09:30.820
This is not a joke, Keller.

09:30.921 --> 09:34.590
This thing's for real,
and it's deadly.

09:34.691 --> 09:35.992
Not only do we have to find it.

09:36.093 --> 09:39.095
We have to capture it, alive.

09:39.196 --> 09:41.964
Why?
Above my pay grade.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.370
You seen this guy by any chance?

09:47.471 --> 09:49.171
Who wants to know?

09:49.272 --> 09:51.440
I'll take that as a yes.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.209
MAN:
Camera truck.

09:53.310 --> 09:55.150
Hey, get the feed set up.
We may be going live.

09:55.245 --> 09:57.380
NYPD! Up against the wall!

09:57.481 --> 10:00.116
You, let's go. Move it!

10:00.217 --> 10:02.151
Grab the gear,
get out of here, now!

10:02.252 --> 10:04.563
MAN: Put your hands above
your head. Come on!

10:04.564 --> 10:06.598
TESS:
NYPD! This is a raid!

10:06.699 --> 10:08.316
Everybody freeze
and get your hands up now.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.138
What the hell is this?!

10:09.162 --> 10:11.113
This bar is under suspicion
of trafficking drugs.

10:11.658 --> 10:13.525
Turn around, get your
hands on the bar.

10:13.627 --> 10:18.298
Everybody meet at Graydal,
0800 hours. Hurry!

10:18.399 --> 10:19.933
Keller, now!

10:22.903 --> 10:24.704
Wait a second. I know you.

10:24.805 --> 10:27.974
You're captain of the 125th,
Chandler's old partner.

10:28.075 --> 10:30.043
Hey, I said turn around, now.

10:30.144 --> 10:31.544
(grunts, gasps)

10:31.645 --> 10:34.681
MAN:
Move it!

10:34.782 --> 10:36.182
(panting)

10:36.283 --> 10:39.252
(tires squeaking)

10:39.353 --> 10:41.321
JT?
Need a ride?

10:41.422 --> 10:43.023
What the hell
are you doing here, man?

10:43.124 --> 10:45.992
Saving your ass again.
Now get in, let's go!

10:46.093 --> 10:49.763
Go!
(tires squealing, engine revving)

10:49.864 --> 10:51.431
Whoa! Whoa! Sorry.
(tires squealing, engine revs)

10:51.532 --> 10:53.933
(horn honking)
Sorry.

JT: <i>All I know is,</i>
<i>Cat called, said Grace Rose</i>

11:08.307 --> 11:10.841
was about to expose you,
and that I had to get you

11:10.943 --> 11:13.144
out of there as fast as possible
because she couldn't.

11:13.245 --> 11:15.379
Why?
Grace Rose.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.847
How the hell did she know

11:16.949 --> 11:18.983
Grace was there
in the first place?

11:19.084 --> 11:20.851
Because she all but told me.
She showed up at my office,

11:20.953 --> 11:23.854
said that she knew about
a secret Graydal meet,

11:23.956 --> 11:26.924
and that she was hoping to show
up and turn the cameras on you.

11:27.025 --> 11:28.826
Welcome home.
Hey.

11:28.927 --> 11:29.827
We got to go.

11:29.928 --> 11:32.230
Go? Go where?

11:32.331 --> 11:33.564
Uh, by the way, you'll need gas
for your trip.

11:33.665 --> 11:35.233
Oh, and I accidentally
hit a couple

11:35.334 --> 11:36.601
of garbage cans
getting out of there, so...

11:36.702 --> 11:38.002
Oh, as long as it still drives.

11:38.103 --> 11:39.837
You might want to
get something to eat.

11:39.938 --> 11:40.905
Why? Why? Where are we going?

11:41.006 --> 11:42.440
As far away from Grace's cameras

11:42.541 --> 11:43.781
as we can, as soon as possible.

11:43.842 --> 11:45.876
It's only a matter
of time before

11:45.978 --> 11:47.111
she shows up here looking
for one of us,

11:47.212 --> 11:48.613
and she will undoubtedly

11:48.714 --> 11:50.181
think that I had something
to do with the raid.

11:50.282 --> 11:51.749
JT, can you keep an eye

11:51.850 --> 11:53.951
on Grace, make sure that
she isn't following us,

11:54.052 --> 11:55.219
and find out
what she really knows?

11:55.320 --> 11:57.688
Can I use DHS surveillance?
Sure.

11:57.789 --> 11:59.857
Are you ready?

11:59.958 --> 12:01.626
No, I'm not ready, okay?
I can't just up and leave.

12:01.727 --> 12:03.561
Dawes is about
to reassemble and soon.

12:03.662 --> 12:05.363
Catherine, this is
my best chance

12:05.464 --> 12:07.365
of finally finding out
who is behind this all.

12:07.466 --> 12:09.600
This is also your best
chance of being exposed.

12:09.701 --> 12:12.069
Vincent, I can redirect DHS

12:12.170 --> 12:14.071
cameras and surveillance
to protect you,

12:14.172 --> 12:15.606
but I can't redirect the press.

12:15.707 --> 12:17.375
And if they find you,

12:17.476 --> 12:20.811
then it's all over, not just
our happily ever after.

12:20.912 --> 12:23.114
Vincent, we have got
to get out of town.

12:23.871 --> 12:26.606
We need to figure out
what to do because whatever

12:26.707 --> 12:28.541
we're doing now isn't working.
Then everything I've done

12:28.642 --> 12:30.743
to get Graydal to trust
me so far is gonna be lost.

12:30.844 --> 12:33.579
Come on, if I don't show up,
they're gonna be more suspicious

12:33.681 --> 12:36.149
of me than they were before.
Not as suspicious as they'd be

12:36.250 --> 12:39.085
if Grace exposes you to be
the beast they're looking for.

12:41.422 --> 12:42.422
Thank you.

12:42.523 --> 12:44.223
You're welcome.

12:44.325 --> 12:46.492
Protein bar?
Look, I don't get

12:46.593 --> 12:49.062
how running away from this is
gonna solve any of our problems.

12:49.163 --> 12:50.930
It doesn't, but it buys us time

12:51.031 --> 12:52.832
to figure out a way
out of this mess.

12:52.933 --> 12:55.001
JT, don't tell Tess
about what we're doing.

12:55.102 --> 12:56.469
The less she knows, the better,

12:56.570 --> 12:57.804
especially after what happened
at the tavern.

12:57.905 --> 12:59.906
Wait. Tess was behind the raid?
Who else?

13:00.007 --> 13:02.367
But I thought we were trying to
keep her out of all this, so

13:02.443 --> 13:05.979
she can have a normal life,
so she can date.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.648
We are, and we will.
We got to go.

13:08.749 --> 13:11.284
Oh. Whether we like or not,
apparently.

13:11.385 --> 13:14.620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:17.057 --> 13:20.293
Where's Keller?

13:20.394 --> 13:22.762
Hmm? Anybody hear from him?

13:22.863 --> 13:24.664
No. And I still
don't trust the guy.

13:24.765 --> 13:26.799
But you don't remember
what he did to piss you off.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.634
I'm telling you, Keller
drugged me, or something.

13:28.736 --> 13:32.605
Right, but you remember him
kicking the crap out of you.

13:32.706 --> 13:35.375
Sit down.

13:35.476 --> 13:37.276
Turns out last night's
police raid

13:37.378 --> 13:38.778
is the least of our problems.

13:38.879 --> 13:40.546
Apparently, some reporter
was there, too,

13:40.647 --> 13:41.823
and she knew about our meet.

13:41.824 --> 13:42.429
How?

13:42.453 --> 13:44.453
Because we've been
infiltrated, that's how.

13:44.551 --> 13:47.353
That's why we met off-site,
because we knew we had a leak.

13:47.454 --> 13:49.655
But now, we've been
ordered to stand down

13:49.757 --> 13:53.626
until we find out who it is,
and while you find out

13:53.727 --> 13:56.696
how much the reporter knows
about what we were doing.

14:00.134 --> 14:02.001
(police siren toots)

14:02.102 --> 14:03.636
Really? You're not mad.

14:03.737 --> 14:05.805
Even though I totally
bolted on you?

14:05.906 --> 14:09.642
Tonight? Yeah,
sure, Alex, I'd love to.

14:09.743 --> 14:11.744
Captain, we need to talk.

14:11.845 --> 14:14.380
Can I call you back?
Agent Chandler alerted you, didn't she?

14:14.481 --> 14:16.482
She told you I was coming.
Okay.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.418
First of all, I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

14:18.519 --> 14:20.159
And secondly, you are not
allowed in here.

14:20.254 --> 14:22.221
What are you gonna do--
throw me up against the wall?

14:22.322 --> 14:24.390
Use police force, or
should I say, abuse it?

14:24.491 --> 14:25.992
Okay, Ms. Rose, look, I'm sorry

14:26.093 --> 14:27.693
that you got caught up in the raid...
Oh, please.

14:27.795 --> 14:30.229
That wasn't a raid. That
was a sham, and you know it.

14:30.330 --> 14:32.031
I go to Chandler, she
goes to her best cop bud,

14:32.132 --> 14:34.000
and the next thing I know,
the police show up?

14:34.101 --> 14:36.069
You know what
that tells me?

14:36.170 --> 14:39.105
I must be close to blowing the
story about Keller wide open.

14:39.206 --> 14:40.740
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
just risked your career

14:40.841 --> 14:42.208
to cover for him and his wife.

14:42.309 --> 14:44.444
A secret DHS manhunt,

14:44.545 --> 14:47.780
super soldiers, Graydal
and now a police cover-up?

14:47.881 --> 14:51.384
This is an even better
story than I imagined.

14:51.485 --> 14:52.852
(door opening)

14:52.953 --> 14:55.088
(door closing)

14:55.189 --> 14:57.557

15:22.549 --> 15:24.884
(sighs)

15:24.985 --> 15:27.720
Yikes!

15:27.821 --> 15:30.089
Where did you say you
found this place again?

15:30.190 --> 15:32.725
Remember that romantic
getaway we were planning

15:32.826 --> 15:34.227
for our six-month anniversary?

15:34.328 --> 15:36.129
Uh-huh.
Tada!

15:38.866 --> 15:41.134
(beeping)

15:41.235 --> 15:42.568
There's no service up here?

15:42.669 --> 15:44.604
Good.
Good?

15:44.705 --> 15:46.806
Come on. I got to let
the team know that I'm okay.

15:46.907 --> 15:48.508
Team? You're
not going all

15:48.609 --> 15:49.929
Stockholm Syndrome
on me, are you?

15:50.010 --> 15:51.277
That's not what I meant.

15:51.378 --> 15:54.080
Hey, grab an end.

15:54.181 --> 15:56.449
It's so dusty in here.

15:56.550 --> 15:57.812
You think they have a vacuum?

15:57.836 --> 15:59.480
A vacuum?
Why, you want to move in?

15:59.481 --> 16:01.549
That's not the worst
idea we've ever had.

16:01.649 --> 16:02.382
You can't be serious.

16:02.483 --> 16:05.118
No, I'm not serious.

16:05.219 --> 16:08.546
What's going on with you? Can't
you just relax for a minute?

16:08.570 --> 16:09.489
I would love to,

16:09.490 --> 16:11.925
but it's a little hard when, you
know, all hell's breaking loose

16:12.026 --> 16:14.361
in the city for me.
Right. That's why we're here,

16:14.462 --> 16:16.964
to come up with a plan
before we go back.

16:17.065 --> 16:18.825
We've got a plan, okay?
Graydal's got a plan,

16:18.900 --> 16:21.134
and if I don't get back in time
to help them find a beast, then I am...

16:21.235 --> 16:23.070
Vincent, you are the beast.
Unless they figure out

16:23.171 --> 16:25.105
that you're here,
they aren't gonna find one.

16:25.206 --> 16:27.874
Yeah. But if the client doesn't
think it's gonna happen soon,

16:27.976 --> 16:30.877
I'm gonna lose my only chance
of identifying who is behind

16:30.979 --> 16:33.146
this, all right? You know
what that means? Yeah, yeah,

16:33.247 --> 16:34.382
we're back to square one! Great.

16:34.406 --> 16:36.506
Well, it's better
than Grace Rose exposing you,

16:36.517 --> 16:38.218
which is exactly what's gonna
happen if you go back now.

16:38.319 --> 16:40.087
So we stay here and do nothing?

16:40.188 --> 16:42.155
You know, hope everything
just goes away,

16:42.256 --> 16:43.957
hope magically
we get our lives back?

16:44.058 --> 16:46.393
We're never gonna get our lives
back, Vincent,

16:46.494 --> 16:47.494
don't you see that?

16:51.099 --> 16:52.833
Whatever we had,
whatever we thought

16:52.934 --> 16:54.334
we could get back, it's gone.

17:02.510 --> 17:04.511
Who are we even kidding?

17:04.612 --> 17:06.613
Even if all of
this goes perfectly--

17:06.714 --> 17:07.981
we find the beast buyer,
you get exonerated,

17:08.082 --> 17:10.250
Grace Rose
goes away--

17:10.351 --> 17:14.021
we can't get back what we had.

17:14.122 --> 17:15.789
You don't know that.

17:15.890 --> 17:17.790
Yeah.

17:17.892 --> 17:20.127
Yes, I do.

17:20.228 --> 17:21.962
And so do you.

17:22.063 --> 17:24.364
There's no
explaining this

17:24.464 --> 17:27.267
without being tainted,
without suspicion.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.603
Do you really think
that the hospital's

17:29.704 --> 17:31.138
gonna take you back
after all this?

17:31.239 --> 17:35.542
Even in the
best-case scenario.

17:35.643 --> 17:38.879
DHS isn't gonna keep me either,
not after everything I've done.

17:38.980 --> 17:43.216
Tess, Tess can't hire me back
even if she wanted to.

17:44.886 --> 17:48.121
Normal's lost, Vincent.

17:48.222 --> 17:51.391
No matter what
happens next,

17:51.492 --> 17:56.063
our lives are never gonna be
the same.

18:17.058 --> 18:18.826
(trilling)

18:30.805 --> 18:32.840
(groans)

18:32.941 --> 18:34.909
Not good.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.845
Not good.
Hey.

18:37.946 --> 18:40.180
So, what, I got to
change my caller I.D.

18:40.282 --> 18:41.549
so you answer your damn phone?

18:41.650 --> 18:43.150
Tess, hey.

18:43.251 --> 18:44.919
What are you doing here?

18:45.020 --> 18:47.354
I'm trying to save my job.
Wh-Why are you ducking me?

18:47.455 --> 18:49.423
What? I'm-I'm not ducking you.

18:49.524 --> 18:52.192
Really, JT? Flicking off
monitors? So-so, what, you're

18:52.294 --> 18:53.227
hiding crap from me now, too?

18:53.328 --> 18:54.328
No, I'm not.

18:56.164 --> 19:00.000
Well... yeah, actually,
I am. But it's

19:00.101 --> 19:02.202
only because we're trying
to protect you. That's all.

19:02.304 --> 19:03.337
Protect me?

19:03.438 --> 19:05.272
Yes. Cat and I agreed

19:05.373 --> 19:06.817
not to involve you
any more than we have to.

19:06.842 --> 19:08.316
Okay, well, it's
a little late for that,

19:08.317 --> 19:09.578
'cause Grace Rose has
already threatened

19:09.678 --> 19:11.912
to expose me along
with Vincent now.

19:12.013 --> 19:13.347
What?
(sighs) Never mind.

19:13.448 --> 19:14.768
Where's Cat?
I got to talk to her.

19:17.118 --> 19:18.852
You're not gonna tell me?
Hey, I can't.

19:18.954 --> 19:21.689
Again, the less you know, the
better. It's for your own good.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.557
Really? Really? For my own good?
You want to know

19:23.658 --> 19:25.726
what's for my own good? It's
not having to keep getting

19:25.827 --> 19:26.776
dragged back into all this
beast crap. That's what.

19:26.801 --> 19:27.861
I know. That's what...

19:27.862 --> 19:29.782
No, but nothing changes.
No matter how hard I try

19:29.831 --> 19:31.131
to have some semblance
of a life,

19:31.232 --> 19:32.633
it just keeps coming back
to bite me in the ass.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.034
Look, Tess...
No, you look.

19:34.135 --> 19:36.203
This time Cat has
to cover for me, okay?

19:36.304 --> 19:38.872
She has to say that DHS asked me
to raid that tavern,

19:38.974 --> 19:40.894
'cause I sure as hell
didn't have probable cause.

19:40.976 --> 19:42.896
And as soon as Grace
finds that out, I'm screwed.

19:42.978 --> 19:44.378
So where's Cat?

19:44.479 --> 19:46.747
I'm sorry.

19:49.084 --> 19:52.920
Oh, you're unbelievable.

19:53.021 --> 19:55.556
Is this you finding your path,
JT?

19:55.657 --> 19:58.325
How long can you keep
doing this, hacking into

19:58.426 --> 20:01.061
God knows what you're
hacking into now?

20:01.162 --> 20:04.465
This can't go on. I
can't keep doing this.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.310
(sighs)

20:16.411 --> 20:17.578
(grunts)

20:17.679 --> 20:19.179
(exhales)

20:21.750 --> 20:23.117
Hey.

20:24.919 --> 20:25.919
Hey.

20:26.621 --> 20:27.354
You want to be alone?

20:27.455 --> 20:30.658
(grunts)

20:30.759 --> 20:34.028
No. I've been alone
way too much lately.

20:35.363 --> 20:36.697
You know, I don't like it.

20:36.798 --> 20:38.132
Take a walk with me?

20:38.233 --> 20:39.466
Sure.

20:46.241 --> 20:49.543
You know,
maybe we <i>could</i> stay here.

20:49.644 --> 20:51.545
Come on. It's beautiful,

20:51.646 --> 20:54.048
it's clean, it's safe,

20:54.149 --> 20:56.684
apart from the odd bear,
but I can handle those.

20:56.785 --> 20:57.777
No, you can't be serious.

20:57.802 --> 20:59.802
No, I could.
I could handle a bear or two.

20:59.888 --> 21:01.455
You know, maybe not
a grizzly, but...

21:01.556 --> 21:05.192
No, I meant the staying here
part. You couldn't, right?

21:05.293 --> 21:08.829
I don't know. Could you?

21:08.930 --> 21:10.831
Not for very long.

21:10.932 --> 21:12.833
I'm a city girl.
I always have been.

21:12.934 --> 21:15.903
Well, there's plenty of other cities.
True.

21:16.004 --> 21:18.906
What about Heather,
JT, Tess?

21:19.007 --> 21:21.542
Postcards, Skype.

21:21.643 --> 21:24.978
(scoffs)
Come on, who are we kidding?

21:25.080 --> 21:27.981
There's no escaping
this, right?

21:28.083 --> 21:29.983
Graydal will find us
sooner or later

21:30.085 --> 21:33.153
or whoever else the
beast buyer's hiring next.

21:33.254 --> 21:36.090
Yeah, if DHS doesn't
find you first.

21:36.191 --> 21:38.258
I can't keep them off your tail
for much longer, Vincent.

21:38.359 --> 21:41.195
So either they're gonna catch
you or they're gonna bust me.

21:41.296 --> 21:43.030
It's pretty bleak either way.

21:43.131 --> 21:45.432
Those bears are looking
better and better.

21:45.533 --> 21:48.602
There's always Grace Rose.
(chuckles)

21:48.703 --> 21:52.439
No, look, under the umbrella
of not having

21:52.540 --> 21:55.275
any other good options
and running out of time,

21:55.376 --> 21:57.711
she might be our only hope.
Only hope? Come on.

21:57.812 --> 21:59.284
She's trying to expose
the hell out of me.

21:59.308 --> 22:01.308
No. No, she is

22:01.382 --> 22:04.885
trying to expose DHS's secret
manhunt. She wants to figure out

22:04.986 --> 22:07.621
what really happened to Hill,
which, if she can, Vincent,

22:07.722 --> 22:12.092
exonerates you and gives us
both back our freedom.

22:12.193 --> 22:14.394
She doesn't even know
about beasts.

22:14.496 --> 22:16.764
She knows about super soldiers,
she knows about Graydal,

22:16.865 --> 22:19.199
she knows about the
explosion at the Army base.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.602
She knows too many things.
It's just a matter of time

22:21.703 --> 22:23.203
before she connects
all of those dots.

22:23.304 --> 22:25.606
All the more reason for us
to get out ahead of this

22:25.707 --> 22:27.374
and tell her
the real story about Hill

22:27.475 --> 22:29.610
before DHS spins it
for her

22:29.711 --> 22:32.079
and turns you in-into a scapegoat.
You can't be serious.

22:32.180 --> 22:35.249
It's crazy.

22:35.350 --> 22:36.550
It's crazy.
Is this any crazier

22:36.651 --> 22:38.585
than what we've been doing?
(groans)

22:44.893 --> 22:47.294
(sighs)

22:53.067 --> 22:56.603
You really think we can convince
her to get our story out

22:56.704 --> 22:59.339
without having to
mention beasts?

22:59.440 --> 23:03.010
I think we can trust her.

23:03.111 --> 23:05.445
We're backed
into a corner.

23:05.547 --> 23:07.514
All we have left
is the truth.

23:07.615 --> 23:10.450
Unless, of course,
you want to keep running

23:10.552 --> 23:12.953
and wait till somebody
catches us.

23:14.522 --> 23:16.857
No.

23:27.035 --> 23:29.269
We're gonna go to 1 Police
Plaza. I've got an interview

23:29.370 --> 23:30.838
with the deputy commissioner.

23:30.939 --> 23:32.472
Then we're gonna go
to Chandler's apartment,

23:32.574 --> 23:34.208
have another little chat
before...

23:34.309 --> 23:36.543
(phone rings)
Hold on a sec. Hi,

23:36.644 --> 23:38.478
this is Grace.

23:38.580 --> 23:41.014
Hello?
This is Agent Chandler.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.883
Can we talk?

23:46.221 --> 23:49.489
I'll meet you back at the truck.
Where are you?

23:49.591 --> 23:51.959
First, I need to know if you
meant what you said before,

23:52.060 --> 23:53.060
that you protect your sources.

23:53.161 --> 23:54.661
If it warrants it, yes.

23:54.762 --> 23:56.296
Trust me, this warrants it.

23:56.397 --> 23:58.298
You're gonna have to come alone,

23:58.399 --> 24:00.901
and everything has
to be off the record

24:01.002 --> 24:03.136
until we really believe that
we can trust you. Otherwise,

24:03.238 --> 24:04.004
no deal.

24:04.105 --> 24:05.105
"We"?

24:05.173 --> 24:08.242
Yeah, "we."

24:08.343 --> 24:10.477
Where do I go?

24:10.578 --> 24:12.913
I'm not on my cell, so I can't
text you. You have something

24:13.014 --> 24:14.715
to write this down with?

24:16.084 --> 24:18.752
Okay. Go ahead.

24:23.091 --> 24:24.858
Yes, I know the area.

24:30.098 --> 24:31.598
Okay, I'll be there.

24:31.699 --> 24:33.567
It'll take me a couple hours
to get there.

24:50.977 --> 24:52.411
Oh, God.

24:52.512 --> 24:54.380
Vincent, Grace might be
our only chance.

24:54.481 --> 24:56.949
How do we keep getting ourselves
in this situation?

24:57.050 --> 25:00.319
No one ever said love was easy.
(chuckles)

25:00.420 --> 25:03.155
Agent Chandler?

25:08.695 --> 25:10.829
Thanks for coming.

25:10.931 --> 25:12.965
Sure.

25:13.066 --> 25:14.200
Now what?

25:15.669 --> 25:19.805
Grace Rose,
meet Vincent Keller.

25:25.445 --> 25:27.179
Nice to meet you.

25:27.280 --> 25:31.784
You're a popular
man, Dr. Keller.

25:31.885 --> 25:34.253
How do you know
I didn't bring the cavalry?

25:34.354 --> 25:35.788
Did she?

25:35.889 --> 25:39.024
(heart beating steadily)

25:39.125 --> 25:41.727
No. She's telling the truth.

25:43.930 --> 25:45.831
Now let's see
if she really cares about it.

25:49.269 --> 25:51.637
(indistinct chatter)

25:58.712 --> 26:01.013
Hey. Hi, sorry I'm late.

26:01.114 --> 26:03.382
No, no worries.
No worries. Um...

26:03.483 --> 26:04.650
Cheek kiss?

26:04.751 --> 26:06.385
Yes. Cheek kiss.
(chuckles)

26:06.486 --> 26:09.355
It's good to see you.
Yeah, same here.

26:09.456 --> 26:10.856
So, uh, everything okay?

26:10.957 --> 26:12.557
It sounded pretty important
on the phone.

26:12.626 --> 26:14.526
Yeah, no, everything, uh...
everything's fine.

26:14.628 --> 26:16.061
I just... I need some advice.

26:16.162 --> 26:17.963
Advice?

26:18.064 --> 26:20.532
So, say you had
somebody working for you,

26:20.634 --> 26:23.369
like another attorney,
and they were...

26:23.470 --> 26:26.138
taking the law
into their own hands.

26:26.239 --> 26:28.140
What would you do?
I don't understand.

26:28.241 --> 26:29.975
Uh, can you be more specific?

26:30.076 --> 26:32.845
There's this cop. Not
in my precinct but, you know,

26:32.946 --> 26:36.582
I know her. Good person,
comes from a cop family,

26:36.683 --> 26:38.294
always wanted to
do the right thing.

26:38.318 --> 26:39.485
Okay. But...

26:39.486 --> 26:44.156
But she's been, um... she's been
doing some borderline stuff.

26:44.257 --> 26:46.225
You know, "ends justify

26:46.326 --> 26:50.229
the means" kind of a thing,
covering for fellow cops.

26:50.330 --> 26:51.897
Cops who are doing good stuff

26:51.998 --> 26:54.166
and stopping
really, really bad guys...

26:54.267 --> 26:55.367
I'd arrest her.

26:55.468 --> 26:57.169
I'm sorry?

26:57.270 --> 26:59.571
I'd arrest her.
Take away her shield,

26:59.673 --> 27:00.839
throw her in jail, the works.

27:00.940 --> 27:03.075
Okay, look,

27:03.176 --> 27:06.078
you arrest, I prosecute,
and a judge and jury

27:06.179 --> 27:08.547
decides guilty or innocent.
That's the system--

27:08.648 --> 27:10.015
you know that.
And it's designed

27:10.116 --> 27:11.884
specifically so people
don't take the law

27:11.985 --> 27:13.218
into their own hands,

27:13.320 --> 27:16.088
especially those who carry
a badge and a gun.

27:16.189 --> 27:20.092
You know, I-I'm sorry, Tess,
but as far as I'm concerned,

27:20.193 --> 27:22.961
your friend doesn't deserve
to be a cop anymore.

27:27.734 --> 27:29.201
GRACE:
<i>I'm still a little confused</i>

27:29.302 --> 27:30.969
about the chronology.

27:31.071 --> 27:34.206
DHS comes to you to help stop
an international terrorist...

27:34.307 --> 27:36.575
Liam Cullen, yes,
and we did that.

27:36.676 --> 27:37.776
With, uh, your help.

27:37.877 --> 27:40.446
A doctor?
Yes, well, I used to be

27:40.547 --> 27:42.648
Special Forces.
Uh, Vincent, he...

27:42.749 --> 27:44.083
he offered to help
because Hill wanted

27:44.184 --> 27:45.751
to keep the operation quiet.

27:45.852 --> 27:47.219
That's why he set me up
off-site.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.088
He didn't want the rest of DHS

27:49.189 --> 27:51.309
to know about what he was doing.
Because he was afraid

27:51.358 --> 27:53.283
it would get out and alarm the public?

27:53.307 --> 27:53.992
- Yes.
- Exactly, yes.

27:53.993 --> 27:55.994
Then why did you kill
Secretary Hill?

27:56.096 --> 27:58.630
In self-defense.

27:58.732 --> 28:01.934
But why?
Why would Hill try to kill you?

28:04.237 --> 28:05.504
Uh, uh...

28:07.340 --> 28:08.390
Uh...

28:08.414 --> 28:10.414
He was, um...
he was getting nervous.

28:10.710 --> 28:12.945
He was afraid that the rest
of DHS would find out

28:13.046 --> 28:14.680
about what he was doing.
But why would he get in trouble

28:14.781 --> 28:16.682
for wanting to keep looking
for terrorists?

28:16.783 --> 28:18.450
That was his job.
He was doing it

28:18.551 --> 28:21.353
outside of DHS. He was
doing it outside of the law.

28:21.454 --> 28:23.422
Hill believed
that there was

28:23.523 --> 28:25.932
a major threat out
there somewhere,

28:25.933 --> 28:28.835
and, for whatever reason,
he didn't think

28:28.936 --> 28:30.737
that DHS would support him
in stopping it.

28:30.838 --> 28:33.540
Okay. You worked for him,

28:33.641 --> 28:35.275
you answered to him.
What was the reason?

28:35.376 --> 28:37.243
I can't tell you that.

28:38.546 --> 28:40.947
Then I can't help you.

28:41.048 --> 28:42.415
Even if Hill hired
Graydal hit men

28:42.516 --> 28:44.351
to take Vincent
out first?

28:44.452 --> 28:45.852
Do you have proof of that?

28:45.953 --> 28:47.287
No. No, not yet.

28:48.389 --> 28:49.723
(sighs)

28:49.824 --> 28:52.125
There's just
too many unanswered questions.

28:52.226 --> 28:54.894
Why did Hill keep
this from DHS?

28:54.996 --> 28:57.397
Why did he ask for
Vincent's help and then think

28:57.498 --> 28:59.599
killing him would cover
it up? And who exactly

28:59.700 --> 29:02.635
was Hill trying to stop
in the first place?

29:02.737 --> 29:05.638
Look, I believe you're sincere.
Otherwise I wouldn't be here.

29:05.740 --> 29:07.260
But I can't help you get
your story out

29:07.341 --> 29:08.942
without cold, hard facts
to back it up.

29:09.043 --> 29:13.046
That's not how I work.
I need to know the truth.

29:13.147 --> 29:14.147
Yeah.

29:15.383 --> 29:17.617
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

29:19.587 --> 29:20.854
VINCENT:
Uh...

29:22.390 --> 29:24.124
Okay, wait.

29:24.225 --> 29:26.292
Do we have a choice?

29:26.394 --> 29:29.996
Um, y-you...
you may want to...

29:30.097 --> 29:32.465
probably sit down
for this.

29:32.566 --> 29:34.167
Why?

29:34.268 --> 29:37.237
(roars)
(gasps, panting)

29:37.338 --> 29:39.572
Okay, Grace,
just-just breathe.

29:39.673 --> 29:40.974
Breathe. Here. Have some water.

29:41.075 --> 29:43.443
(panting)

29:43.544 --> 29:46.146
Just, by the way,
that was off the record.

29:46.247 --> 29:47.647
VINCENT:
So now

29:47.748 --> 29:49.282
will you please help us?

29:52.386 --> 29:54.954
Yeah.

29:58.526 --> 30:00.593
Wait, what's the matter?

30:00.694 --> 30:03.163
There's somebody out there.

30:03.264 --> 30:04.831
You must've been followed.

30:04.932 --> 30:07.000
No, I wasn't.
I-I made sure of it.

30:08.469 --> 30:09.702
Down! Get down, now!

30:15.543 --> 30:16.042
(shouts)

30:16.143 --> 30:17.811
(ringing)

30:17.912 --> 30:20.814
(muffled coughing)

30:20.915 --> 30:23.216
(muffled):
Vincent, are you okay?

30:23.317 --> 30:24.784
Are you okay?!

30:24.885 --> 30:27.954
(muffled):
Yeah! I-I think so.

30:28.055 --> 30:29.189
What was that?

30:29.290 --> 30:31.124
(coughing)
A flash grenade.

30:31.225 --> 30:32.492
DHS?

30:32.593 --> 30:34.627
No. (coughs)
Graydal.

30:34.728 --> 30:36.696
Grace.
(panting)

30:36.797 --> 30:39.332
All right, stay low, okay?
We're gonna find her.

30:39.433 --> 30:42.001
(both coughing)

30:42.103 --> 30:44.571
Grace!

30:44.672 --> 30:46.639
Grace!

30:46.740 --> 30:48.675
Grace. Grace.

30:48.776 --> 30:51.344
Hey. Stay with me, okay?
Hey, look at me, look at me.

30:51.445 --> 30:53.480
Look at me. Stay with me.
You're gonna be fine,

30:53.581 --> 30:55.148
all right?
You're gonna be fine.

30:55.249 --> 30:56.769
Her pulse is thready.
We got to get her

30:56.851 --> 30:58.017
to the hospital, fast.
KANE: Looks like

30:58.119 --> 31:00.053
we finally found
ourselves a beast!

31:01.155 --> 31:03.323
It's Kane.

31:03.424 --> 31:05.024
I should have known it was you,
Keller!

31:10.664 --> 31:11.364
Hey.

31:11.465 --> 31:12.565
Hey, stay with me.

31:12.666 --> 31:14.567
I'm really looking forward
to this.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.683
Grace, you're gonna be
all right. Stay with me.

31:20.784 --> 31:23.219
Go get a blanket or something.
Get something to cover her up.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.529
Just keep with me, all right?

31:25.553 --> 31:27.088
You stay with me. You're
gonna be absolutely fine.

31:27.090 --> 31:27.534
Here.

31:27.557 --> 31:29.921
She's going into shock.
I can't do much for her here.

31:30.193 --> 31:31.000
We got to get her to the
hospital, okay?

31:31.024 --> 31:32.928
Okay. But how
are you gonna get past Graydal?

31:32.929 --> 31:34.730
I don't think it's the whole
team. Otherwise they would've

31:34.831 --> 31:36.399
stormed the place by now.
(coughs)

31:36.500 --> 31:38.334
I'm pretty sure
it's just Kane on his own.

31:38.435 --> 31:39.869
Yeah, but he knows how
to capture a beast.

31:39.970 --> 31:42.338
Which is why
we're gonna give him one.

31:42.439 --> 31:43.472
What?

31:45.942 --> 31:47.843
Come on out, Keller!

31:47.944 --> 31:49.378
Catherine, it's her
only hope, okay?

31:49.479 --> 31:52.214
It may be ours, too.
Look, he wants me,

31:52.315 --> 31:54.088
I'm gonna bolt, I'm gonna
get him away from the cabin.

31:54.112 --> 31:56.018
What, just let him capture you?

31:56.019 --> 31:58.187
Hopefully not, but it's our only
chance. I mean, it's gonna

31:58.288 --> 31:59.855
give you time to get her
in the car and to the hospital.

31:59.956 --> 32:01.036
KANE:
You know what I've got

32:01.124 --> 32:03.893
and you know you can't escape.

32:03.994 --> 32:06.328
And I've got ten million
reasons to make sure you don't.

32:09.399 --> 32:11.867
Come on out, Keller,
and I'll let the ladies go.

32:11.968 --> 32:13.569
I promise.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.271
He's lying, he won't
leave any witnesses.

32:15.372 --> 32:17.940
Wait... Vincent,
that might be our only hope.

32:21.311 --> 32:23.245
Time's up, freak show.

32:29.152 --> 32:30.252
VINCENT:
Cat!

32:30.353 --> 32:32.655
No... No, come on,
breathe, Cat.

32:32.756 --> 32:35.758
Come on, breathe, Cat,
just breathe!

32:35.859 --> 32:37.860
No!

32:39.062 --> 32:40.062
(loud growl)

32:56.713 --> 32:57.980
(growls)

33:10.460 --> 33:12.027
(grunting)

33:18.135 --> 33:20.236
(growling)

33:29.246 --> 33:31.180
(groaning)

33:35.886 --> 33:37.853
(grunts)
Aah!

33:37.954 --> 33:39.955
Oh...

33:40.056 --> 33:41.457
So let me
get this straight--

33:41.558 --> 33:42.992
you worked your way
into Graydal,

33:43.093 --> 33:45.161
worked your way
onto the beast-hunting team...

33:45.262 --> 33:48.330
(grunts)
Aah! (groans)

33:48.431 --> 33:50.032
...even though you're the one
we were looking for

33:50.133 --> 33:53.469
all along?
Why?

33:53.570 --> 33:55.171
To find out who put up
the bounty money--

33:55.272 --> 33:57.306
is that it?
(grunting)

33:57.407 --> 33:59.341
(laughs)

33:59.442 --> 34:02.211
Well, I'm guessing
you're about to find out anyway.

34:12.522 --> 34:15.524
Soon as I can collect
the reward.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.096
Drop it! Drop it now.

34:23.033 --> 34:25.434
I thought you were dead.

34:25.534 --> 34:28.938
You were supposed to.
Put the rifle down, now.

34:30.273 --> 34:32.007
Or what--

34:32.108 --> 34:33.609
you just gonna shoot me?

34:33.710 --> 34:34.844
Arrest me?

34:34.945 --> 34:36.512
You think I won't

34:36.612 --> 34:38.746
tell everybody about him?

34:38.849 --> 34:40.683
I'm assuming you'd prefer
to keep it a secret.

34:40.784 --> 34:41.784
No.

34:45.155 --> 34:46.522
No one's gonna believe you.

34:46.623 --> 34:48.190
Somebody will.

34:48.291 --> 34:49.525
Graydal will,

34:49.626 --> 34:51.726
maybe even DHS.

34:53.530 --> 34:55.464
How else are you gonna
explain all this?

34:55.565 --> 34:57.233
Aah!

35:00.237 --> 35:02.238
It must be a hell of a burden

35:02.339 --> 35:04.173
trying to keep this
under wraps all the time.

35:05.475 --> 35:07.042
No,

35:07.143 --> 35:08.310
no!

35:08.411 --> 35:10.746
KANE:
How about you drop your gun.

35:25.695 --> 35:26.795
(grunts)

35:33.603 --> 35:35.404
Go, go, go.

35:35.505 --> 35:36.805
Don't worry about me.

35:36.907 --> 35:39.108
You just go,
go help Grace.

35:39.209 --> 35:41.844
No, Vincent, it's too late.

35:43.079 --> 35:44.380
She's gone.

35:56.249 --> 35:58.984
CORONER:
All right, on three-- go.

35:59.084 --> 36:01.686
OFFICER: Everybody clear out,
the coroner's coming through.

36:09.095 --> 36:10.736
No offense,
I had to check you out.

36:10.737 --> 36:12.904
I understand, I would've
done the same thing.

36:13.006 --> 36:14.106
Although your superior
did seem surprised

36:14.207 --> 36:15.447
to hear that you were out here.

36:15.475 --> 36:18.410
She asked that you
give her a call ASAP.

36:19.679 --> 36:21.780
OFFICER:
I got to back to the truck.

36:21.881 --> 36:24.416
Can we have
a couple more bags?

36:48.775 --> 36:50.275
Hey.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.510
Hey.

36:51.611 --> 36:53.145
Did you see the news?

36:53.246 --> 36:56.348
About Grace, yeah.
Wait, are Cat and Vincent...

36:56.449 --> 36:59.318
No, they're fine. That's why
I came by-- I didn't want you

36:59.419 --> 37:01.086
to think that anything
happened to them, too.

37:01.187 --> 37:03.355
But they were there, right? When
it happened?

37:03.456 --> 37:05.490
Yeah.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.759
It's not what you think.

37:07.860 --> 37:10.495
They weren't trying to duck her
again, they were actually trying

37:10.596 --> 37:11.596
to come clean with her.
They were actually

37:11.698 --> 37:13.498
trying to tell Grace the truth,

37:13.599 --> 37:16.468
get her help. She got
caught in the crossfire.

37:16.569 --> 37:17.936
JT, you talk about it like

37:18.037 --> 37:19.471
she just got a flesh wound
or something.

37:19.572 --> 37:20.839
She's dead.

37:20.940 --> 37:22.474
An innocent person is gone.

37:22.575 --> 37:23.942
Why? Just because she wanted

37:24.043 --> 37:25.544
to tell a story.

37:26.579 --> 37:29.348
(sighs)

37:29.449 --> 37:32.150
I cannot...
I cannot do this anymore.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.819
What's wrong?
What's going on?

37:33.920 --> 37:35.760
What are you doing?
I'm resigning, that's what.

37:35.822 --> 37:37.289
Whoa, whoa, wait. You're
not thinking straight.

37:37.390 --> 37:38.890
I'm actually thinking
perfectly straight.

37:38.991 --> 37:40.831
Are you gonna get out of my way?
No, I won't.

37:40.893 --> 37:43.562
With all due respect,
you're way overreacting here.

37:43.663 --> 37:46.465
You're not responsible for
what happened to Grace.

37:46.566 --> 37:47.899
No, but I'm responsible

37:48.000 --> 37:49.801
for knowing what really
did happen to her,

37:49.902 --> 37:51.570
for knowing what's
really going on,

37:51.671 --> 37:53.805
and all I did is cover it up,
and I act like it's normal, like

37:53.906 --> 37:57.175
it's okay, but it's not okay,
all right? Not anymore. Please.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.244
No. I can't let
you do this.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.380
You can't give up
being a captain.

38:01.481 --> 38:03.715
I'm not. I'm...

38:03.816 --> 38:06.718
I'm giving up
being a cop, all right?

38:06.819 --> 38:09.654
Cops do not pick and choose when
and where to uphold the law, JT.

38:09.756 --> 38:11.223
They don't cover things up,

38:11.324 --> 38:13.024
hoping they're doing
the right thing. That's not

38:13.126 --> 38:14.326
what this is,
and that's not what

38:14.427 --> 38:16.428
I ever wanted
to become, so, please.

38:16.529 --> 38:18.930
Okay, wait. How about this?
What if you...

38:19.031 --> 38:20.699
you-you stop covering up?

38:20.800 --> 38:24.436
What if you stop...
knowing what's going on?

38:24.537 --> 38:25.254
What are you talking about?

38:25.278 --> 38:27.274
I'm talking about
saving your career.

38:27.373 --> 38:31.376
I'm talking about...
saving your normal.

38:31.477 --> 38:34.079
Look, I can quote
chapter and verse

38:34.180 --> 38:36.681
about all the innocent people
you've saved over the years

38:36.783 --> 38:39.584
precisely because you covered up
for Cat and Vincent,

38:39.685 --> 38:42.287
which, as far as I'm concerned,
justifies everything.

38:42.388 --> 38:45.924
But whether or not you agree,
you can't change the past,

38:46.025 --> 38:47.926
but you can change the future.

38:48.027 --> 38:51.530
Don't cover for us anymore
if you don't want to,

38:51.631 --> 38:53.064
but don't quit.

38:53.166 --> 38:55.267
Don't throw away everything

38:55.368 --> 38:58.203
you've worked so hard
to achieve.

38:58.304 --> 39:00.272
That isn't right, either.

39:02.809 --> 39:06.578
So, what, you're just gonna keep
the beast stuff from me?

39:06.679 --> 39:08.447
If that's what you want.

39:08.548 --> 39:11.883
But what if our paths cross,
like on a case or something?

39:11.984 --> 39:13.464
What am I supposed to do--
arrest you?

39:13.519 --> 39:15.153
Ideally, no, but...

39:15.254 --> 39:16.788
(laughs)

39:16.889 --> 39:19.157
But...

39:19.258 --> 39:21.493
if that's the risk
we have to take

39:21.594 --> 39:23.528
to keep you from resigning,
then yeah.

39:25.064 --> 39:26.798
I guess so.

39:26.899 --> 39:29.167
Well, it sounds crazy...

39:29.268 --> 39:31.436
but I'll think about it.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.171
Thank you.

39:34.273 --> 39:35.941
Hey.

39:53.860 --> 39:57.128
(siren blaring)

40:05.571 --> 40:06.938
(sighs)

40:07.039 --> 40:10.008
I don't like it.

40:10.109 --> 40:12.010
I don't like it, either,
but what choice do we have?

40:12.111 --> 40:14.479
It's like you said-- we're
running out of time, right?

40:14.580 --> 40:16.948
From DHS, from Graydal,
from the press now.

40:17.049 --> 40:18.350
(sighs)

40:18.451 --> 40:19.851
We got to do something.

40:19.952 --> 40:21.620
We can't keep running.

40:21.721 --> 40:24.990
Vincent, it's risky.
I know. I know,

40:25.091 --> 40:27.659
but at least this way,
I'm gonna find out who's behind

40:27.760 --> 40:29.861
the bounty, you know? Hopefully,
eliminate one of our problems.

40:29.962 --> 40:32.397
But we don't even know what
he wants to do with a beast,

40:32.498 --> 40:34.399
and whatever it is,
it can't be good.

40:42.675 --> 40:46.311
There's no turning back,
remember?

40:46.412 --> 40:48.480
Whatever our future holds,
this is how we find out.

40:48.581 --> 40:50.415
This is where we start.

40:56.255 --> 40:58.957
I'm gonna be okay.
You'd better be.
