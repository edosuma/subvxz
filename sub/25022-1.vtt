<i>She told me once:</i>

00:12.006 --> 00:15.029
<i>"When we read a story,
we inhabit it;</i>

00:15.865 --> 00:20.349
<i>the covers of the books
are like a roof and four walls:</i>

00:21.218 --> 00:22.433
<i>a house."</i>

00:23.789 --> 00:26.257
<i>She, more than anything else
in the world,</i>

00:26.465 --> 00:29.106
<i>loved the moment
when you've finished a book</i>

00:29.246 --> 00:31.018
<i>and the story keeps playing</i>

00:31.157 --> 00:33.382
<i>like the most vivid dream
in your head.</i>

00:35.363 --> 00:37.517
<i>And after that,
she loved taking long walks</i>

00:37.656 --> 00:40.784
<i>to clear her mind
of all the emotions and feelins</i>

00:40.923 --> 00:42.975
<i>the book had started within her.</i>

01:19.259 --> 01:20.650
<i>That very morning,</i>

01:21.277 --> 01:25.066
<i>after hazy years
of reading, walking</i>

01:25.378 --> 01:27.985
<i>and mourning
the death of her husband,</i>

01:29.028 --> 01:30.383
<i>Florence Green woke up,</i>

01:30.522 --> 01:32.782
<i>knowing exactly
what she wanted to do.</i>

01:33.024 --> 01:34.553
<i>She was going to open a bookshop</i>

01:34.692 --> 01:37.021
<i>in the little village
where she had ended up living.</i>

01:37.820 --> 01:39.593
I am convinced
this new bookshop will be

01:39.732 --> 01:41.574
everything you say it is,
Mrs. Green.

01:41.817 --> 01:43.486
But, of course, for now
I can give you

01:43.626 --> 01:45.536
no definite commitment
on behalf of the bank.

01:45.884 --> 01:48.039
The decision
does not depend upon me.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.986
And I have your honest assurance

01:50.125 --> 01:51.725
that you've had ample experience
in the trade?

01:52.003 --> 01:53.497
I learned the trade
very thoroughly

01:53.634 --> 01:54.992
when I was a girl,

01:55.233 --> 01:57.389
and I don't believe it's changed
greatly since then.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.996
And more importantly, I know...

02:01.560 --> 02:02.707
I love reading.

02:03.055 --> 02:05.175
Well, it would do little harm

02:05.313 --> 02:06.807
to let you know
one or two things.

02:07.156 --> 02:09.727
Consider them words of advice,
if you prefer.

02:10.110 --> 02:11.154
This is the way I...

02:11.293 --> 02:12.473
<i>She had a great heart,</i>

02:12.856 --> 02:14.698
<i>and enormous patience.</i>

02:15.567 --> 02:18.244
<i>But not even these two virtues
were strong enough</i>

02:18.486 --> 02:22.170
<i>to bear the grandiloquent
and patronizing tones</i>

02:22.308 --> 02:24.222
<i>of Mr. Keble,
the Hardborough banker,</i>

02:24.985 --> 02:28.461
<i>whom everyone called
Mr. Potatohead behind his back.</i>

02:42.502 --> 02:46.118
<i>I should tell you
that there are those who beliee</i>

02:46.395 --> 02:48.898
there are other possible uses
for the Old House.

02:49.036 --> 02:52.060
Though of course there's always
the possibility of a resale...

02:52.340 --> 02:54.252
But I've no intention
of reselling, Mr. Keble.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.398
Not in the slightest.

02:56.163 --> 02:58.597
What else do people think
the Old House could be used for?

02:58.908 --> 03:00.298
Why have they
done nothing about it

03:00.439 --> 03:01.411
in the past seven years?

03:01.549 --> 03:03.009
There were birds nesting in it,

03:03.184 --> 03:05.826
half the tiles were off the roof
and it stank of rats.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.806
Wouldn't it be better
to fill the place with books

03:07.946 --> 03:09.022
for people to look at?

03:09.231 --> 03:10.830
I read before going to sleep,

03:11.247 --> 03:13.610
and usually drift off
to the Land of Nod

03:13.751 --> 03:14.793
by about the third page.

03:15.208 --> 03:16.286
So you see?

03:16.634 --> 03:18.859
Don't you realize
how useful books can be?

03:48.577 --> 03:52.782
<i>The weather in this part of
the world was totally unpredictable.</i>

03:53.442 --> 03:56.014
<i>Sometimes all four seasons
could be present</i>

03:56.154 --> 03:57.579
in a single morning.

04:04.773 --> 04:08.909
<i>That sunny day she left the bak
feeling angry, proud,</i>

04:09.048 --> 04:11.447
<i>impatient, and terribly alive.</i>

04:12.663 --> 04:14.818
<i>She was going
to pursue her dream</i>

04:14.956 --> 04:17.529
<i>and nobody,
not even Mr. Potatohead,</i>

04:17.668 --> 04:19.058
<i>was going to stop her.</i>

04:23.334 --> 04:25.836
Hello, Mrs. Green,
are you busy?

04:26.460 --> 04:29.520
Hello, Mr. Raven.
Not at the moment, why?

04:30.564 --> 04:32.997
Can I, uh,
throw the rope to you?

04:34.004 --> 04:35.013
Yes, of course!

04:36.298 --> 04:38.314
Watch out!
It's very slippery,

04:38.452 --> 04:42.032
that's how Ethan broke his leg
yesterday but I'm well aware...

04:42.241 --> 04:45.717
that you are a woman
who don't frighten easily.

04:45.856 --> 04:47.246
How do you know that?

04:48.671 --> 04:52.877
Rumor has it that you're about
to open a bookshop here.

04:55.657 --> 04:57.881
Why do you feel
it's something daring?

04:58.647 --> 05:02.088
The only person here
who reads is Mr. Brundish.

05:02.645 --> 05:03.896
And I don't think
he's gonna be

05:04.243 --> 05:05.875
leaving home
to be your customer.

05:06.119 --> 05:08.099
I think I saw him yesterday
on the hill.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.734
Well, caught a glimpse of him,
anyway.

05:09.874 --> 05:12.863
I imagine
you had a long conversation.

05:13.002 --> 05:15.330
Oh yes, never stopped talking!

05:16.026 --> 05:17.346
Farewell.

05:18.180 --> 05:20.648
Good luck, Mrs. Green!

05:21.413 --> 05:23.395
Do you not read, Mr. Raven?

05:25.340 --> 05:26.278
I don't.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.546
Books leave me exhausted.

05:31.144 --> 05:32.917
Real life is enough for me.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.671
<i>Mister Brundish lived alone</i>

05:49.808 --> 05:52.172
<i>in the oldest house
in Hardborough.</i>

05:52.936 --> 05:55.613
<i>He didn't particularly like
his own company,</i>

05:56.066 --> 05:58.117
<i>but after long years of battle</i>

05:58.463 --> 06:01.625
<i>he had reached
a lasting truce with himself.</i>

06:02.772 --> 06:05.276
<i>He adored books
with the same passion</i>

06:05.414 --> 06:08.334
<i>with which he detested
his fellow men.</i>

06:09.725 --> 06:11.498
<i>He often cherished the fantasy</i>

06:11.638 --> 06:13.444
<i>that the volumes he devoured
from morning to night</i>

06:13.581 --> 06:15.598
<i>hadn't been written by
human beings,</i>

06:16.155 --> 06:19.491
<i>but had appeared
through spontaneous generation.</i>

06:20.534 --> 06:22.828
<i>There was nothing
that bothered him more</i>

06:22.967 --> 06:24.773
<i>than the portraits of writers</i>

06:24.913 --> 06:27.381
often included
in certain editions.

07:15.728 --> 07:17.709
It's not red.

07:18.334 --> 07:21.568
It's a... very deep maroon,

07:21.707 --> 07:23.548
or a... rust.

07:24.209 --> 07:26.050
Anyway, how is the Old House?

07:26.225 --> 07:27.719
Hmm? How are you coping?

07:28.241 --> 07:30.882
Well, Sam Wilkins was in, and fixed
the bath, and tiled the roof

07:31.020 --> 07:34.288
and repaired the cistern
as best as he could, anyway.

07:35.505 --> 07:38.529
That place is...
like an old fossil.

07:38.946 --> 07:40.961
Even the straw is 500 years old.

07:41.101 --> 07:42.630
All right. Arms up!

07:44.645 --> 07:45.584
There.

07:46.869 --> 07:48.817
You are still
gonna move in there, aren't you?

07:48.990 --> 07:51.040
I spent my first night there
last night.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.160
What? So soon?

07:53.404 --> 07:54.933
I told everyone to watch out.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.063
But nobody actually thought you
were gonna move into the Old House,

07:58.201 --> 08:00.530
- what with the damp and all.
- Oh, yes, I know they didn't,

08:00.668 --> 08:01.850
but it was fine.

08:02.198 --> 08:04.214
A bit creepy in the night,
but that's...

08:04.667 --> 08:06.577
because I'm not used to it yet,
I suppose.

08:08.072 --> 08:11.688
I should think the wood in an old
house like that creaks everywhere.

08:16.969 --> 08:19.263
I'm afraid red
isn't really for me.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.052
And it doesn't look very good
on me from behind, but...

08:24.025 --> 08:25.450
Perhaps
if I stand against the wall

08:25.590 --> 08:26.945
most of the time I'm there...

08:28.475 --> 08:31.186
- Too red, don't you think?
- It's not...

08:31.985 --> 08:32.889
It's not red.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.573
It's a very deep maroon.

08:36.712 --> 08:37.371
Yes.

08:38.135 --> 08:40.119
You'll get used to it, in time.

08:41.332 --> 08:42.481
Need a bit of jewelry.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.601
- Make it stand out.
- Yes. Yes.

08:45.261 --> 08:47.381
- Are you sure?
- Well, of course I'm sure.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.328
It's not every day that
the General and Mrs. Gamart

08:49.468 --> 08:51.586
- invite you to a party, is it?
- No.

08:52.665 --> 08:55.515
Oh, stop agonizing!

08:55.758 --> 08:56.698
You look...

08:57.705 --> 08:58.886
lovely.

08:59.650 --> 09:01.771
Anyway, when you get there, you won't
have to worry about how you look.

09:01.911 --> 09:02.884
No one'll mind you.

09:03.161 --> 09:05.003
You'll probably know
all the guests, anyhow.

10:12.501 --> 10:14.030
I... I'm Florence Green.

10:14.795 --> 10:17.020
I'm the one
opening the little bookshop.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.844
That's it, of course!

10:20.983 --> 10:23.347
Got it right away!

10:24.215 --> 10:25.432
Ah! Of course!

10:25.605 --> 10:29.255
Violet was very interested
in that matter. Mm...

10:29.879 --> 10:33.704
She wanted one of
those conversations of hers...

10:35.198 --> 10:37.146
...with you about the bookshop.
Hmm.

10:45.069 --> 10:47.084
She's rather caught up
right now,

10:47.883 --> 10:50.700
but I believe she wishes
to talk to you later.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.443
So, uh...

10:58.034 --> 11:00.814
What sort of stuff are you going
to have in your shop?

11:01.057 --> 11:02.970
Well, um...

11:04.254 --> 11:05.888
- Basically books.
- Mmm.

11:06.479 --> 11:09.538
They don't publish many books
of poetry these days, do they?

11:09.677 --> 11:11.694
I... I don't see too many about.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.333
Well, I... I shall have
some poetry, of course,

11:14.474 --> 11:17.428
but it doesn't sell
quite so well as other things,

11:17.567 --> 11:19.060
like novels and essays.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.328
It... It'll take me some time
to find out

11:22.468 --> 11:23.961
what kind of stock
I'll be bringing in...

11:24.101 --> 11:25.248
Of course. Mmm.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.021
For the moment
I've mainly ordered classics,

11:27.159 --> 11:29.419
Thackeray, Dickens, Keats...
That sort of thing.

11:32.199 --> 11:34.006
"It is easy to be dead.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.031
Say only this...

11:37.759 --> 11:39.151
they are dead."

11:41.340 --> 11:42.940
Do you know who wrote that?

11:43.426 --> 11:44.191
No.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.416
I'm... I'm so sorry, I don't.

12:05.774 --> 12:07.477
I know who you are.

12:09.668 --> 12:11.198
You must be Mrs. Green.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.074
Yes.

12:13.351 --> 12:15.819
And I know who you are,
of course, Mr. North.

12:15.994 --> 12:17.975
Ah-ha!

12:18.218 --> 12:21.102
Though I... I've never had an
invitation to The Stead before,

12:21.242 --> 12:23.396
- I expect you come here often.
- Oh, yes.

12:23.641 --> 12:26.281
I do get invited
frequently.

12:28.053 --> 12:29.826
Oh, thank you.
You're very kind.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.182
Ooh, Not very.

12:31.599 --> 12:32.885
Here you go.

12:43.658 --> 12:45.397
You live on your own, don't you?

12:45.816 --> 12:47.934
You've just moved
into the Old House.

12:48.211 --> 12:49.222
All by yourself?

12:52.176 --> 12:53.183
War widow.

12:56.658 --> 12:57.667
I know.

12:59.093 --> 13:01.177
Have you never thought of
marrying again?

13:02.915 --> 13:03.820
No.

13:05.104 --> 13:05.973
No.

13:06.529 --> 13:09.066
The problem is
I was very happily married.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.075
How odd.

13:10.631 --> 13:11.953
I was always
under the impression

13:12.092 --> 13:14.176
that it is precisely
when a woman is widowed

13:14.593 --> 13:16.331
that she starts to get happy.

13:23.735 --> 13:27.732
Are you sure you've received the
proper advice to run a business?

13:33.050 --> 13:35.101
I've never met you
before now, Mr. North,

13:35.240 --> 13:37.880
but I assume,
because of your work,

13:38.020 --> 13:39.480
you would be someone
who would appreciate

13:39.618 --> 13:41.182
having a bookshop
in Hardborough.

13:43.964 --> 13:45.110
Uh...

13:45.388 --> 13:48.098
I am sure you know writers
at the BBC,

13:48.238 --> 13:50.150
and... and thinkers,
and so forth.

13:50.290 --> 13:53.730
And I trust they come down here
from time to time

13:53.870 --> 13:56.370
to...
see you, and get some fresh air.

13:56.579 --> 13:58.422
Ha!

13:58.595 --> 14:00.229
If they did come...

14:00.891 --> 14:02.454
I wouldn't quite know
what to do with them.

14:02.594 --> 14:06.034
I mean, writers will go anywhere
where there is free drink.

14:06.172 --> 14:09.023
I'm not so sure about thinkers.

14:11.907 --> 14:15.835
Anyway, I think that Kattie,
my so-called girlfriend,

14:15.974 --> 14:17.226
would look after them.

14:17.573 --> 14:19.554
Well, at any rate,
you must both come to my shop.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.049
I shall rely on you.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.517
On no account.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.503
Madam,
would you like some canapes?

14:30.816 --> 14:32.345
Why are you wearing red?

14:33.178 --> 14:35.542
Red's a color that
only looks good on housemaids

14:35.681 --> 14:36.933
out on their day off.

14:37.141 --> 14:40.200
It's not red, it's a...
It's a deep maroon.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.747
My dear lady.

14:54.554 --> 14:56.222
Florence, isn't it?

14:56.361 --> 14:57.508
Yes.

14:57.926 --> 14:59.560
I have been wanting to speak
to you since you arrived,

14:59.699 --> 15:01.368
but my guests seem to have
nothing better to do

15:01.505 --> 15:03.207
than steer me away from
my priorities.

15:03.417 --> 15:05.329
Thank you so much for coming!

15:05.572 --> 15:07.727
- Thanks... for inviting me.
- It's such a pleasure!

15:07.935 --> 15:09.569
It's such a lovely party,
really.

15:09.707 --> 15:11.481
Everyone is talking
about your new venture.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.600
You have such a great nose
for business!

15:13.774 --> 15:15.511
- Well, yes, but it's...
- Bruno!

15:15.651 --> 15:18.016
Have you been introduced
to my husband?

15:19.963 --> 15:22.534
Come and tell Mrs.

15:22.743 --> 15:23.749
- Miss...
- Green.

15:24.167 --> 15:26.322
...how delighted we are
to see her.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.685
And to think
we've all been praying

15:28.824 --> 15:30.805
for a good bookshop
in our little town,

15:30.945 --> 15:32.335
haven't we, Bruno?

15:32.543 --> 15:34.491
Of course, my dear.
There's no harm in praying.

15:34.907 --> 15:37.271
Things would probably go
much better

15:37.409 --> 15:39.008
if we all prayed more.

15:40.746 --> 15:44.152
Just one thing, Mrs. Green,
and a very small one at that.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.323
You haven't actually moved
into the Old House, have you?

15:48.464 --> 15:50.617
Yes, I've been there
over a week.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.518
But there's no water.

15:55.971 --> 15:58.159
Sam Wilkins connected the pipes
for me.

15:58.716 --> 16:01.773
Don't forget, Violet, you've been
in London a good deal lately,

16:01.914 --> 16:04.659
and you haven't been able
to control everything.

16:05.459 --> 16:07.093
Why shouldn't I have moved in?

16:07.230 --> 16:09.698
I believe I can spare you
many disappointments,

16:09.838 --> 16:11.541
and maybe even a bit of money.

16:12.061 --> 16:14.460
I... In fact, I hope to help you.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.082
There are other much more
appropriate locations

16:19.397 --> 16:22.107
in Hardborough,
especially for a bookshop.

16:22.838 --> 16:26.452
I'm afraid we are all so used
to seeing the Old House empty

16:26.870 --> 16:30.761
that we've procrastinated
year after year...

16:31.006 --> 16:32.674
You have practically
showed us all up

16:32.814 --> 16:34.585
by being in such a hurry,
Mrs. Green.

16:34.898 --> 16:39.555
But the fact is that many of us
are not at all convinced

16:39.694 --> 16:44.143
by the sudden transformation
of the Old House into a shop.

16:44.733 --> 16:47.863
Many of us believe
it should be a kind of...

16:49.113 --> 16:50.885
local arts center.

16:51.339 --> 16:54.431
Fine, Violet,
you could pray for that also.

16:55.404 --> 16:58.706
Chamber music in summer,
lectures in winter...

16:58.950 --> 17:03.433
There is simply no other old
house that has the right...

17:07.117 --> 17:08.334
ambience.

17:08.856 --> 17:12.297
I've been negotiating this sale
for over six months, so...

17:12.887 --> 17:15.946
You see, it's hard for me
to believe

17:16.084 --> 17:18.691
there's anyone left in Hardborough
who doesn't know about it.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.507
In fact, I'm sure they all know.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.843
And we have one great advantage,

17:24.983 --> 17:27.034
it would be a shame to just...

17:27.693 --> 17:28.979
throw it away,

17:29.292 --> 17:32.802
which is that now we have
exactly the right person

17:32.941 --> 17:36.175
to take charge of the matter... I
mean to take charge of the Center.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.642
You do understand, don't you?

17:38.781 --> 17:41.563
Why don't you think it over
for a bit?

17:43.821 --> 17:46.427
- Ah! Sonia!
- Mrs. Gamart...

17:46.567 --> 17:48.130
How wonderful you look!

17:49.103 --> 17:51.328
<i>Her feet
and head ached</i>

17:51.779 --> 17:55.046
<i>and she regretted having taken
the seamstress's advice</i>

17:55.185 --> 17:57.376
<i>as to the color of her dress.</i>

17:58.105 --> 17:59.288
<i>That was all.</i>

17:59.878 --> 18:02.415
<i>Not for one moment did she thik
about the consequences</i>

18:02.554 --> 18:06.065
<i>that her modest act of inhabiting
Old House would bring upon her.</i>

18:12.078 --> 18:14.233
You look radiant.

18:15.866 --> 18:17.396
Isn't that Lord Gosfield?

18:17.604 --> 18:21.290
My word! What a guest list
this evening, Violet.

18:21.915 --> 18:23.375
Thank you.

18:26.293 --> 18:27.927
- Lord Gosfield.
- How do you do?

18:28.275 --> 18:31.264
How difficult it has been to try
to reach you this evening!

18:31.402 --> 18:35.156
I hope Bruno has told you about
our new Hardborough Center...

18:35.296 --> 18:37.695
- Oh, yes.
- ...for music and the arts?

18:37.972 --> 18:39.605
We were just talking about it.

18:48.573 --> 18:49.964
Mrs. Green!

18:50.798 --> 18:52.258
- Hello.
- Mr. Deben.

18:52.396 --> 18:54.065
- Good morning.
- I'm glad I caught you.

18:54.204 --> 18:56.950
- How are you?
- Very well, thanks. Very well.

18:57.089 --> 19:00.182
Um, I wanted to ask you
about my shop.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.579
I want to speak to you
about my shop. Um...

19:03.067 --> 19:04.492
- It's up for auction.
- Yes.

19:04.631 --> 19:08.664
Not until April.
Could be later, still...

19:09.046 --> 19:12.034
Um... Well, the fact is, I...

19:12.728 --> 19:17.317
I'd much prefer to reach
a private agreement before that.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.140
As you've expressed a certain
interest in the property

19:21.660 --> 19:25.555
and since you are not going
to remain in the Old House...

19:26.771 --> 19:30.350
Well, I trust that you'll
appreciate that I'm too busy

19:30.491 --> 19:33.306
to pay attention
to any rumors I hear.

19:35.633 --> 19:39.979
Well, it stands to reason you'll be
making an offer on other premises.

19:42.446 --> 19:45.367
There's been a misunderstanding,
Mr. Deben, but...

19:45.678 --> 19:49.258
Yes, but it doesn't matter
in the slightest, and I, um...

19:49.572 --> 19:52.353
I... I should like to be able
to help you.

19:53.430 --> 19:55.690
Mrs. Gamart was, um...

19:55.897 --> 19:59.824
kind enough to tell me about
her idea for an arts center.

19:59.964 --> 20:02.570
From which, I am sure,
every one of us

20:02.708 --> 20:04.551
living here in Hardborough
would benefit.

20:04.690 --> 20:09.556
And I believe she is the one who
was searching about for premises,

20:10.043 --> 20:12.964
and what could be better than
your fish shop?

20:16.856 --> 20:19.046
Yeah... I see.

20:20.157 --> 20:22.243
Well...
You've been extremely kind.

20:22.869 --> 20:25.963
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome, Mr. Deben.

20:26.588 --> 20:28.951
- Well, good morning.
- Yeah. Thank you, Mrs. Green.

20:29.439 --> 20:32.809
<i>Florence had managed
to live life thus far</i>

20:32.947 --> 20:36.457
<i>by pretending that human beings
were not divided</i>

20:36.598 --> 20:40.768
<i>into exterminators
and exterminated,</i>

20:41.220 --> 20:44.278
<i>with the former at any moment
predominating.</i>

20:56.652 --> 20:58.043
Ah-ha!

20:58.216 --> 21:00.476
I... I didn't know if you'd
be down in London or...

21:00.615 --> 21:04.196
London? No, I'm here.
Well, I think I am.

21:07.078 --> 21:08.401
- May I?
- Yeah.

21:08.992 --> 21:11.249
Um... Nescafé?

21:11.494 --> 21:13.857
Oh, I... I've never tried it.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.221
I have heard of it, but I...

21:16.533 --> 21:19.070
I'm told it's not made
with boiling water.

21:19.348 --> 21:21.364
Yeah.

21:30.472 --> 21:32.070
This is all
much too small for you.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.260
Oh, I know, I know.

21:37.039 --> 21:40.446
You know? I'm glad
that you've, uh, dropped in.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.688
No one else compels me
to face the truth.

21:46.631 --> 21:49.760
Well, that's fortunate, because
I've come to ask you a question.

21:51.047 --> 21:53.028
When Mrs. Gamart was talking
at her party

21:53.168 --> 21:55.496
about the ideal person
to run an arts center,

21:55.635 --> 21:58.485
it was you, of course,
that she had in mind, wasn't it?

21:59.180 --> 22:00.466
It wasn't me.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.239
Sorry. Violet's party?

22:06.686 --> 22:08.738
Did she expect me just to move
out of my house

22:08.877 --> 22:12.144
and, probably, for that matter,
out of the town altogether

22:12.666 --> 22:16.350
assuming that you would come
to the Old House to...

22:17.322 --> 22:19.095
manage everything?

22:19.860 --> 22:21.425
If she'd been referring me,

22:21.598 --> 22:24.134
I doubt very much that she would
have used the word "manage".

22:29.904 --> 22:30.982
Ah...

22:32.199 --> 22:34.284
Do you fancy Nescafé or...

22:36.788 --> 22:37.692
not?

22:37.933 --> 22:39.777
No. No, neither, thank you.

22:40.019 --> 22:41.583
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

22:42.141 --> 22:44.606
- Do you mind if I...?
- Oh, no, please.

22:45.372 --> 22:47.875
I should probably get going.

22:48.013 --> 22:49.577
Are you? Really?

22:50.481 --> 22:52.775
Yes. Thank you anyway.

22:53.575 --> 22:55.730
Well, it's, um...
It's lovely to see you.

23:02.124 --> 23:04.557
<i>Well,
from what I've heard,</i>

23:04.697 --> 23:07.373
<i>and practically by chance,
you were starting to think twie</i>

23:07.548 --> 23:09.111
about the whole
bookshop operation.

23:09.424 --> 23:10.883
Well,
then you've heard wrong,

23:11.023 --> 23:12.204
Mr. Thornton.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.776
I am here to demand
that all unresolved matters

23:14.916 --> 23:16.861
be resolved
as quickly as possible,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.502
so that I might set up the
bookshop without further delay.

23:20.059 --> 23:22.319
- But I... I was told that you...
- What?

23:22.805 --> 23:24.057
That I'd be leaving
the Old House,

23:24.196 --> 23:25.932
which is, by the way,
my only home?

23:26.454 --> 23:29.513
There are many other vacant
properties in Hardborough

23:29.653 --> 23:33.338
and, as it happens, I have a list of
some of the more out of the way ones.

23:33.475 --> 23:35.386
I expect no further delays,
Mr. Thornton.

23:35.526 --> 23:37.299
Please have all pending papers
sent to me.

23:37.438 --> 23:39.802
And once again, I am
ever so grateful for your help.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.195
Is there something
I can help you with, boys?

24:47.370 --> 24:50.496
- We are Sea Scouts, ma'am.
- Yes, so I see.

24:50.775 --> 24:52.583
And just what is it
that you are doing here?

24:52.721 --> 24:54.668
Mr. Raven told us
to stop around.

24:54.843 --> 24:56.475
What would you like us to do?

24:59.186 --> 25:01.550
Well, I want all the bookshelves
put up in there.

25:01.690 --> 25:02.905
Do you think
you can manage that?

25:03.115 --> 25:05.304
How many hand drills can you get
us, ma'am?

25:06.832 --> 25:09.336
How long have you been waiting
here, in the pouring rain?

25:11.456 --> 25:12.950
If I can find the keys...

25:13.505 --> 25:15.315
Okay, hurry up!

25:33.561 --> 25:38.079
<i>When Mrs. Green opened the
first box of books she had ordered,</i>

25:38.947 --> 25:43.048
<i>all the problems and obstacles of
those past few days simply vanished.</i>

25:44.126 --> 25:48.853
<i>With each edition, the faces
and the words of Mrs. Gamart,</i>

25:49.340 --> 25:50.382
<i>the banker,</i>

25:50.870 --> 25:52.085
<i>her lawyer,</i>

25:52.607 --> 25:54.032
<i>and Milo North</i>

25:54.519 --> 25:56.431
<i>all faded away.</i>

25:58.273 --> 25:59.628
<i>And for a moment,</i>

25:59.977 --> 26:04.182
<i>she felt that her late husband,
whom she had loved so dearly,</i>

26:04.598 --> 26:06.753
<i>was with her once again.</i>

26:15.511 --> 26:19.127
<i>And this was her happiest momet
in the bookshop.</i>

26:56.075 --> 26:59.968
Very, uh, lonely job, yours.

27:00.418 --> 27:03.581
Oh. Sorry about the waders.

27:04.694 --> 27:06.744
I don't feel
in the least bit lonely.

27:11.853 --> 27:14.634
That shelf in there is a fifth
of an inch crooked.

27:15.502 --> 27:18.318
And that plastering
looks hideous.

27:19.744 --> 27:21.968
You can let them know
the next time you see them.

27:22.559 --> 27:25.303
No. No, it all looks wonderful,
Mr. Raven.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.565
I couldn't be happier with
the work the boys have done,

27:27.703 --> 27:28.919
honestly.

27:29.441 --> 27:32.046
Is that you, Wally?
Were your ears burning?

27:32.498 --> 27:34.063
What are you doing here, boy?

27:34.202 --> 27:35.557
I've a message for Mrs. Green.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.443
- From whom?
- From Mr. Brundish, Mr. Raven.

27:38.825 --> 27:39.903
What?

27:40.494 --> 27:43.031
He just came out of Holt House
and handed you a note?

27:43.170 --> 27:44.629
No, he leaned out of the window

27:44.768 --> 27:47.966
and told me to go and give this
to Mrs. Green.

27:49.149 --> 27:51.164
I don't see how
this can be for me.

27:51.685 --> 27:53.666
I've never spoken
to Mr. Brundish, ever.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.161
I can't believe
he even knows my name.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.143
And whenever I run into him
on the headland

27:57.281 --> 28:00.235
he always goes off like a shot,
as if he's just seen a ghost!

28:00.374 --> 28:02.043
I'm certain
he'll know who you are.

28:02.391 --> 28:04.267
He finds out about everything
that happens in town.

28:04.406 --> 28:05.621
I don't know how he does it.

28:06.039 --> 28:08.369
Don't you worry about
the envelope's black edges?

28:08.508 --> 28:10.246
He ordered those envelopes
back around 1919,

28:10.385 --> 28:13.130
when they were all returning
from the First War, and...

28:13.581 --> 28:15.772
Mrs. Brundish died...

28:16.466 --> 28:18.205
during their honeymoon.

28:18.378 --> 28:20.951
Oh, yes. How did she die?

28:21.888 --> 28:23.522
She was drowned...

28:24.669 --> 28:26.060
crossing the marshes.

28:27.069 --> 28:29.015
She had gone to pick
some blackberries

28:29.153 --> 28:31.169
to bake a pie for Mr. Brundish.

28:42.395 --> 28:43.473
"Dear Madam..."

28:43.681 --> 28:45.419
I would like to wish you well.

28:46.532 --> 28:48.339
Back in
my great grandfather's day,

28:48.477 --> 28:50.215
there was a bookseller
in the High Street,

28:50.355 --> 28:53.101
who, if my memory
serves me correctly,

28:53.308 --> 28:56.159
knocked out one of his customers
with a desk pad

28:56.299 --> 28:58.245
when he became annoying.

28:59.322 --> 29:01.128
There'd been some delay
in the arrival

29:01.267 --> 29:04.883
of the latest instalment
of a new novel, I believe...

29:06.029 --> 29:08.220
I believe it was
<i>Dombey and Son.</i>

29:09.504 --> 29:10.999
As of that day,

29:11.140 --> 29:12.913
no one has plucked up
courage enough to sell books

29:13.050 --> 29:15.588
in this forsaken coin
of the world.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.334
This is a great honor you do us.

29:19.376 --> 29:24.068
I should undoubtedly visit your
shop one day if I ever went out,

29:24.834 --> 29:28.657
but nowadays I rather make
a point of never doing that.

29:29.525 --> 29:31.576
In spite of everything,

29:31.785 --> 29:34.497
should you deem
some literary novelty worthy,

29:34.634 --> 29:37.206
please, don't hesitate
to send it to me.

29:38.215 --> 29:42.317
In the case of biographies,
it's better, I find,

29:42.455 --> 29:44.853
if they are about good people,

29:44.993 --> 29:48.330
whereas novels are much more interesting
if they are about nasty people.

29:49.024 --> 29:52.500
Please have the same boy who delivered
this letter bring them to me

29:52.640 --> 29:56.011
with a note, obviously,
indicating their price.

29:56.532 --> 29:57.680
Yours...

29:59.000 --> 30:00.354
respectfully..."

30:00.945 --> 30:02.301
"...Edmund Brundish".

30:04.211 --> 30:05.707
My first customer.

30:11.963 --> 30:14.224
Come round later and I'll give
you a package for Mr. Brundish.

30:14.363 --> 30:15.753
Thank you, Mrs. Green.

30:23.086 --> 30:24.511
You'll probably need
a bright young helper

30:24.651 --> 30:27.118
in the afternoons,
in case it gets busy.

30:28.856 --> 30:31.046
I was thinking of
one of the Gipping girls.

30:31.184 --> 30:33.408
Mrs. Gipping is more or less
up to date on the matter,

30:33.547 --> 30:36.883
and I thought about asking her which of
her daughters might suit you the best.

30:37.614 --> 30:41.577
I think her youngest, Christine,
is the cleverest,

30:41.717 --> 30:44.114
but she probably wouldn't
give her up to you

30:44.253 --> 30:45.714
for that precise reason.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.640
Good afternoon, Mr. Thornton.
Welcome.

31:15.778 --> 31:16.995
Thank you.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.669
<i>Fahrenheit 451.</i>

31:59.850 --> 32:02.040
What kind of book is this?

32:13.093 --> 32:15.281
You're Christine Gipping,
aren't you?

32:16.290 --> 32:18.965
I would have thought
your older sister would...

32:19.104 --> 32:20.807
My elder sister
spends all her time

32:20.947 --> 32:21.989
with Charlie Cutts.

32:22.128 --> 32:24.283
In fact, on my way over here,

32:24.422 --> 32:27.411
I saw their bikes hidden under fallen
leaves, over by the crossroads.

32:27.933 --> 32:30.227
You won't have any trouble
like that with me, though.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.591
Those things aren't happening
to me yet.

32:32.903 --> 32:34.642
And I find boys to be repulsive.

32:37.525 --> 32:38.499
Um...

32:38.847 --> 32:40.723
And what about
your other sister?

32:41.036 --> 32:43.609
She spends all her time at home,
minding Margaret and Peter.

32:43.922 --> 32:45.207
They're the little ones.

32:46.701 --> 32:50.107
You mustn't think I don't want
to consider you for the job.

32:50.246 --> 32:52.993
It's just that you don't really
look old enough...

32:53.860 --> 32:54.903
or strong enough.

32:55.703 --> 32:57.443
That's hard to say
after first glance.

32:57.858 --> 33:00.396
You look old,
but you don't look strong.

33:00.604 --> 33:03.420
It's all the same anyway.
We're all available.

33:04.149 --> 33:07.313
But my elder sister will be
absent from work half the time

33:07.452 --> 33:09.572
and the middle one
won't show up.

33:09.710 --> 33:11.205
Just a warning.

33:11.378 --> 33:13.603
And I should also let you know
I don't like reading.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.551
I like Geography and Maths.

33:22.188 --> 33:25.385
I'll come round this afternoon and
discuss things with your mother.

33:25.978 --> 33:28.860
And don't worry,
I won't force you to read.

33:28.863 --> 33:30.078
As you wish.

33:30.808 --> 33:33.728
All she'll is that I can work every day
after school, and all day Saturday.

33:33.867 --> 33:37.169
And you can't pay me less than twelve
shillings and six pence a week.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.886
Oh, and to tell me to shut up if
I speak too much.

33:41.026 --> 33:42.347
What about your homework?

33:42.521 --> 33:44.745
Oh,
I can do that when I get home,

33:44.990 --> 33:46.102
after tea.

33:49.507 --> 33:50.969
I like your cardigan.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.886
Did you knit that yourself?

33:54.026 --> 33:55.486
It looks like it would've been
very difficult.

33:55.625 --> 33:57.120
It was in the magazine
<i>Women's Issue,</i>

33:57.328 --> 33:59.657
but the instructions were
for short sleeves.

34:00.734 --> 34:03.166
You have no children,
Mrs. Green?

34:03.168 --> 34:04.072
No.

34:06.365 --> 34:08.380
- Should I have?
- I don't know.

34:08.900 --> 34:12.168
People always say life's passed
by women who have no children.

34:14.324 --> 34:15.993
There aren't enough cards
on display.

34:16.341 --> 34:17.904
Shall I put some more out?

34:18.355 --> 34:19.607
Hm.

34:22.944 --> 34:28.505
They really should be ordered into
romance and nature, or something.

34:32.676 --> 34:34.621
Um, is this what
you call romance?

34:34.864 --> 34:36.638
Oh, my God.

34:36.775 --> 34:37.889
What are these?

34:38.654 --> 34:40.322
I haven't even see them before.

34:40.460 --> 34:43.449
Those sales reps really don't
know what they're sending you!

34:43.591 --> 34:44.946
We've got to throw them away.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.065
I'm sure there's a few people
in this village

34:47.203 --> 34:49.533
who wouldn't mind getting these
posted through their letterbox!

34:49.672 --> 34:51.723
You're right.

34:52.070 --> 34:54.398
- What...?
- Stop looking at them!

34:54.539 --> 34:55.754
You'll be corrupted!

34:56.344 --> 34:59.056
- Where's the bin?
- Don't throw them in the bin!

35:01.350 --> 35:03.367
Come on,
have a cup of tea.

35:08.718 --> 35:10.908
Why's Christine so late?

35:11.359 --> 35:13.864
Because she's been working
for this lady.

35:14.142 --> 35:15.115
Why?

35:15.878 --> 35:17.477
Because she has a shop
full of books

35:17.617 --> 35:18.868
for people to read.

35:19.007 --> 35:20.224
Why?

35:21.648 --> 35:23.143
I don't know.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.701
Good afternoon, Mrs. Gipping.

35:33.257 --> 35:34.578
Come in, Mrs. Green.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.351
Let's have a talk.

35:36.871 --> 35:39.965
I'm not sure if Christine has already
spoken to you about the 12 shillings.

35:40.174 --> 35:42.432
Yes. Yes, yes, she did.

35:54.076 --> 35:55.258
"Dear Madam,

35:55.780 --> 35:57.829
Spare yourself the trouble
of sending more books of poetry

35:57.969 --> 36:00.054
or spuriously
complicated novels.

36:00.264 --> 36:02.731
Please,
at your earliest convenience,

36:02.870 --> 36:04.851
send more books by
Ray Bradbury.

36:05.511 --> 36:08.360
Yours respectfully,
Edmund Brundish."

36:22.195 --> 36:25.635
<i>Very soon, Mrs. Green's
business began to thrive.</i>

36:26.089 --> 36:29.458
<i>Her days were fully occupied
from morning to night.</i>

36:29.909 --> 36:33.802
<i>And for a short time she forgot about
everything concerning Mrs. Gamart</i>

36:33.942 --> 36:38.289
<i>and her plans to turn Old House
into an arts center.</i>

36:56.014 --> 36:57.681
- Good morning, Mrs. Green.
- Hello, Wally.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.150
Thank you for doing me
this favor.

37:00.810 --> 37:01.678
Here you are.

37:02.999 --> 37:05.398
Would you like to come on
an outing, Christine?

37:06.266 --> 37:08.874
I can't, we've got a new stock
arriving tomorrow.

37:09.602 --> 37:10.716
Okay, then.

37:10.925 --> 37:11.863
Goodbye.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.290
Wouldn't you like
to go on an outing?

37:24.097 --> 37:26.703
No. I like Wally, but...

37:27.641 --> 37:30.353
Yes, I know. You did tell me
you find boys repulsive.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.959
But, believe me...

37:34.836 --> 37:36.471
you'll get over it.

37:37.478 --> 37:38.973
Yeah, I suppose.

37:39.286 --> 37:41.928
It's just that I prefer
to be here,

37:42.589 --> 37:44.083
in the bookshop, with you.

37:44.604 --> 37:46.028
It's fun working here.

37:46.967 --> 37:48.741
Even if I don't like reading.

38:24.748 --> 38:27.146
Mrs. Green,
they're dirtying the cards.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.275
We must let them browse.

38:30.413 --> 38:32.464
It's part of the tradition
of a bookshop.

38:32.603 --> 38:35.593
Yes, but they leave everything in
such a mess, and don't buy anything!

38:36.183 --> 38:37.435
Miss?

38:47.896 --> 38:49.044
Florence.

38:49.739 --> 38:52.276
Mr. North. What a surprise.

38:53.561 --> 38:55.820
Hmm...

38:56.480 --> 38:58.844
It seems Violet isn't going
to get her own way.

38:59.714 --> 39:02.495
- Has she stopped by here yet?
- We haven't been open very long.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.343
She will.
She'll appear, eventually.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.499
She's far too much self-respect
not to.

39:07.950 --> 39:13.477
Ah! I'm sure she is simply dying
of curiosity.

39:13.930 --> 39:16.605
- She'll be quite welcome.
- Are you making any money, yet?

39:16.744 --> 39:17.995
Not yet.

39:18.133 --> 39:19.733
You really need something
like this.

39:21.438 --> 39:22.375
This is volume one.

39:23.035 --> 39:25.052
Is there a volume two?

39:26.198 --> 39:29.014
Yes, but I've, um,
lent it to someone,

39:29.153 --> 39:30.230
or left it somewhere.

39:30.613 --> 39:33.568
You should keep them together,
as a set.

39:40.483 --> 39:41.839
<i>Lolita.</i>

39:42.708 --> 39:44.027
Have you read it?
Is it any good?

39:44.167 --> 39:45.941
It'll make you rich, Florence.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.102
Yes but, is it any good? I only stock good
novels. They don't move fast, you know?

39:49.242 --> 39:51.223
According to Graham Greene,
it is a master piece.

39:51.883 --> 39:54.282
Although there are those
who think otherwise.

39:55.916 --> 39:58.209
Thank you
for suggesting it, I...

39:58.731 --> 40:01.859
sometimes feel the need of
good advice. You're very kind.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.718
You're always
making that mistake.

40:09.645 --> 40:11.069
Until next time.

40:25.284 --> 40:28.483
We have the blue one at home.
It has Westminster Abbey on it.

40:29.074 --> 40:31.091
But it goes all the way
round the tin.

40:33.488 --> 40:34.913
I'll put the heater on.

40:36.338 --> 40:38.735
Mum says those paraffin heaters
aren't very safe.

40:39.744 --> 40:44.088
They're not dangerous, as long as you
remember to clean them out properly

40:45.167 --> 40:48.329
and don't pour the liquid
in from both sides at once.

40:48.919 --> 40:52.222
You must never do that, ever,
do you hear me?

40:54.619 --> 40:57.643
I like this old tray. You could
leave it to me in your will.

40:57.818 --> 40:59.208
What?

40:59.869 --> 41:02.301
I don't think I really want to start
thinking about my will just yet.

41:04.386 --> 41:06.298
But when I do
I'll try to remember that.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.661
You will? Are you sure?

41:10.399 --> 41:11.754
Is the tray from Japan?

41:12.171 --> 41:13.528
No, it's...

41:14.015 --> 41:15.682
Chinese lacquer.

41:16.934 --> 41:19.367
My grandfather brought it back
from Nanking.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.355
He was a great traveler.

41:22.982 --> 41:26.631
I don't think they even make lacquer
like this in China anymore.

41:28.611 --> 41:29.759
Thank you.

41:43.072 --> 41:46.755
I was wondering if you'd like me to help
you with your school work or something?

41:47.936 --> 41:50.959
- We could read things together, maybe, or...
- There's nothing to read.

41:51.099 --> 41:54.053
They give you some pictures and say:
"Which one is the odd one out?"

41:54.193 --> 41:56.869
Or they give some numbers
like, um...

41:57.218 --> 42:02.708
...eight, five, eleven,
nine, twenty-two and sixteen,

42:02.917 --> 42:04.968
and you have to say
which one comes next.

42:08.340 --> 42:10.877
Can't begin to know
which one came next.

42:13.588 --> 42:16.229
- You're not cold, are you?
- No.

42:17.898 --> 42:19.358
That Milo is a ferret.

42:19.705 --> 42:22.381
He smiles just like a ferret.
I wish he'd just go to hell.

42:22.521 --> 42:24.258
Stop it, Christine!

42:24.953 --> 42:28.047
You're too nice.
He's a nasty piece of work.

42:28.184 --> 42:30.444
When I'm older I'm gonna try
and be like him.

42:30.584 --> 42:32.045
It's much more practical.

42:38.127 --> 42:40.282
I know you don't like reading,

42:40.420 --> 42:44.451
but there's a book I'm afraid
you must read.

42:45.147 --> 42:46.433
What's it about?

42:46.781 --> 42:47.998
It is about...

42:49.457 --> 42:52.169
good pirates and evil children.

42:52.654 --> 42:54.460
Promise me you'll just
at least just...

42:54.670 --> 42:56.200
open it one day.

42:56.444 --> 42:59.502
Well, if you let me have the
Chinese tray in your will,

42:59.640 --> 43:00.927
I can try.

43:02.629 --> 43:03.533
Deal!

44:04.080 --> 44:05.715
<i>"Dear Mr. Brundish.</i>

44:06.339 --> 44:09.849
<i>Enclosed you will find a copy of a
novel that has just been published:</i>

44:10.128 --> 44:10.893
<i>Lolita.</i>

44:11.414 --> 44:13.707
<i>I must confess
my bewilderment with it.</i>

44:14.472 --> 44:18.885
<i>I would like to know your sincere opinion
of it and ask for a bit of advice:</i>

44:20.069 --> 44:23.371
<i>do you think it is a suitable
book to be sold in my bookshop?</i>

44:24.274 --> 44:26.881
<i>Yours sincerely, Florence Green.</i>

44:27.472 --> 44:29.488
<i>P.S.
If you do not like the book,</i>

44:29.625 --> 44:31.192
there's no need to pay for it."

44:48.811 --> 44:49.995
Stop it!

44:51.697 --> 44:53.748
Stop it! I surrender!

45:33.371 --> 45:35.526
Hello, Mrs. Gipping.
Is everything alright?

45:40.740 --> 45:42.859
I thought you should know
as soon as possible.

45:43.797 --> 45:47.308
Mr. Brundish has asked me to deliver
him a fruit cake on Sunday.

45:48.628 --> 45:50.505
And he has also asked me
to ask you

45:50.819 --> 45:54.017
if you would like to stop by Holt
House for tea that same afternoon.

45:56.797 --> 45:57.944
This Sunday?

45:58.082 --> 45:59.299
Why, yes.

46:00.724 --> 46:01.593
Yes.

46:02.219 --> 46:03.923
Yes, all right, I...

46:04.270 --> 46:06.702
Yes, I'll send him a note. Thank
you for the message, Mrs. Gipping.

46:06.842 --> 46:09.136
I've never delivered a cake
to Mr. Brundish before.

46:11.569 --> 46:13.238
I hope this doesn't become
a habit.

46:19.979 --> 46:21.614
Mrs. Green! Is it true?

46:21.752 --> 46:24.010
Are you having tea at Holt House
this Sunday?

46:24.150 --> 46:26.305
- Yes, Mrs. Keble, it is true.
- Oh!

46:26.515 --> 46:28.947
Is there something I should know
before I go there?

46:29.084 --> 46:32.074
- Mrs. Green.
- Mrs. Deben, how's Mr. Deben?

46:32.388 --> 46:34.543
Still having trouble finding
a buyer for the fish shop,

46:34.682 --> 46:36.106
- I gather?
- Poor thing.

46:36.697 --> 46:40.000
I bet the General and Mrs. Gamart
are seething about the matter.

46:40.451 --> 46:42.710
They've never been invited to
Holt House, you know.

46:42.919 --> 46:44.761
Oh, no, yes, I've heard.

46:45.144 --> 46:47.439
So, Holt House for tea, eh?

46:47.680 --> 46:49.661
He so jealously
guards his privacy

46:50.080 --> 46:52.582
after the tragic death of
his beloved wife.

46:57.378 --> 47:01.827
Well, I sell him
some books, and, um...

47:02.278 --> 47:04.468
ask for advice
about the bookshop.

47:04.884 --> 47:06.554
- Did you, now?
- Oh, right.

47:08.049 --> 47:09.405
Well...

47:09.544 --> 47:12.116
Well, I should get back there,
I suppose.

47:12.323 --> 47:15.973
- Well, it's tipping down, innit?
- Cats and dogs!

47:16.286 --> 47:18.442
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

47:18.579 --> 47:20.074
"Advice about the bookshop"?

47:20.317 --> 47:22.159
What does she need advice for?

48:21.560 --> 48:23.576
Hello?

48:24.793 --> 48:26.288
Mr. Brundish?

48:52.701 --> 48:54.682
Come into the dining room.

50:03.363 --> 50:05.379
You asked me a question.

50:06.350 --> 50:07.742
Yes, I did.

50:08.471 --> 50:09.931
About a new novel.

50:10.975 --> 50:14.763
You were thoughtful enough
to ask me a serious question,

50:15.005 --> 50:17.544
thinking I would be impartial.

50:18.411 --> 50:22.478
You undoubtedly thought I was
quite alone in the world.

50:23.105 --> 50:25.642
Never! I did not
for one second...

50:25.781 --> 50:29.257
I imagine you've been told all
kinds of things about me.

50:29.395 --> 50:31.516
- All bad.
- No.

50:32.280 --> 50:33.357
Really!

50:33.776 --> 50:36.034
I am a widower, I'm sure
you've been told.

50:36.173 --> 50:38.642
I imagine you've also been told
that my wife died

50:38.779 --> 50:41.351
whilst gathering blackberries
to make me a pie,

50:41.491 --> 50:45.871
which is the latest version
going around town.

50:46.008 --> 50:47.366
Well, uh,

50:47.503 --> 50:50.736
none that have been
circulating are true.

50:53.170 --> 50:54.803
- She didn't drown?
- No.

50:56.436 --> 50:57.793
Um...

50:58.278 --> 51:00.989
In the sixth month
of our marriage,

51:01.128 --> 51:04.152
we both, having been
best of friends,

51:04.881 --> 51:06.410
decided that

51:06.551 --> 51:09.819
a friendly separation
would be for the best.

51:10.618 --> 51:11.729
She lives in London.

51:12.390 --> 51:14.545
I haven't seen her for 45 years,

51:14.684 --> 51:18.126
but according to my information,
she's still in very good health.

51:19.549 --> 51:21.357
Although apparently...

51:21.739 --> 51:25.110
she's put on quite
a lot of weight.

51:26.710 --> 51:28.656
She always loved sweets,

51:28.970 --> 51:34.495
although I can ever remember her
baking a cake in her life.

51:36.824 --> 51:39.640
I suppose for the people of
Hardborough it is more picturesque

51:39.777 --> 51:44.574
to imagine Holt House inhabited
by a mourning widower.

51:44.888 --> 51:49.161
As you already know, literature
has done a lot of damage.

51:50.205 --> 51:53.124
Those damned Bronte sisters,
for example,

51:53.438 --> 51:56.357
by whom you have not included
a single copy

51:56.495 --> 52:00.006
in those packages to me,
for which I am ever so grateful.

52:00.633 --> 52:03.205
I imagined you would have read
them already.

52:05.254 --> 52:09.425
One of the Gipping girls,
the third one,

52:09.948 --> 52:12.067
lends you a hand in your shop,
I believe.

52:12.206 --> 52:14.848
And that is all the assistance
you have at your disposal.

52:15.301 --> 52:18.533
I have a bookkeeper who comes in
from time to time, and...

52:18.742 --> 52:20.130
then there's my solicitor.

52:20.340 --> 52:23.225
Tom Thornton. You won't get
very far with that one.

52:24.580 --> 52:27.327
I can't say I'm very fond of
Mr. Thornton.

52:31.149 --> 52:32.539
You know, Mr. Brundish,

52:33.511 --> 52:39.213
there is a certain responsibility
about trying to run a bookshop.

52:41.438 --> 52:42.689
I imagine there is.

52:43.279 --> 52:46.059
Especially if not everyone
approves of it.

52:46.721 --> 52:49.432
There are certain people,

52:49.571 --> 52:52.838
who are rather put out
by your bookshop.

52:53.359 --> 52:57.321
Mrs. Green,
I refer to Violet Gamart,

52:57.947 --> 53:00.068
who had other plans
for the Old House,

53:00.206 --> 53:04.482
and who now, it seems, has taken
further offence to something.

53:05.628 --> 53:07.156
I'm sure that she...

53:07.921 --> 53:10.319
means well.

53:10.668 --> 53:14.040
Means well? Violet Gamart?

53:15.533 --> 53:16.680
That harpy?

53:18.315 --> 53:20.122
What she wants is an...

53:20.400 --> 53:22.242
arts center.

53:23.214 --> 53:27.594
Now I ask you, what the hell does this
damned village need with an arts center?

53:27.733 --> 53:30.027
And how could art have a center?

53:30.166 --> 53:32.321
But she's got it into her head
that it does,

53:32.460 --> 53:36.040
and that's the reason she wants to get
rid of you, and she won't stop...

53:36.527 --> 53:37.848
until she does.

53:40.661 --> 53:42.019
She can't do that.

53:43.061 --> 53:45.460
It's my bookshop. It's my home.

53:47.509 --> 53:50.672
People like Violet Gamart...

53:51.472 --> 53:54.045
have made me
what I am, Mrs. Green.

53:54.808 --> 53:57.693
Thanks to her connections
and acquaintances,

53:57.902 --> 54:02.421
Mrs. Gamart is a very powerful
woman, does that not concern you?

54:09.094 --> 54:10.345
No.

54:15.002 --> 54:17.783
May I get back to the reason
for my visit?

54:20.424 --> 54:24.838
I am thinking of making
a first order of <i>Lolita...</i>

54:25.534 --> 54:29.183
of 250 copies, which would be
a considerable risk.

54:30.297 --> 54:34.361
Of course I'm not consulting you in a
business sense, that would quite wrong.

54:34.535 --> 54:36.865
All I want to know
before I put in the order

54:37.004 --> 54:39.888
is whether you think
it is a good book,

54:40.757 --> 54:46.041
and whether you think it is right
that I should sell it in Hardborough.

54:48.266 --> 54:52.436
I do not attach as much
importance as you do, I dare say,

54:52.957 --> 54:55.355
to the notions of
right and wrong.

54:56.294 --> 54:59.421
I have read <i>Lolita,</i>
as you asked me to.

55:00.013 --> 55:01.611
It is a good book,

55:02.098 --> 55:04.704
and therefore I think you should try and
sell it to the people of Hardborough.

55:04.844 --> 55:07.485
They won't understand it,
but that's all for the best.

55:07.973 --> 55:10.094
Understanding
makes the mind lazy.

55:36.438 --> 55:37.411
Thank you.

55:47.839 --> 55:49.784
Thank you, Mr. Brundish.

55:53.191 --> 55:55.102
Well, I've given you my opinion.

55:56.771 --> 55:59.864
Let me tell you what it is
I admire

56:00.420 --> 56:01.984
about human beings.

56:02.889 --> 56:04.938
What I value most

56:05.738 --> 56:09.144
is the one virtue they share
with gods and animals,

56:09.527 --> 56:14.880
and which I will therefore no
longer refer to as a virtue.

56:15.019 --> 56:15.956
I mean...

56:17.972 --> 56:18.876
courage.

56:20.857 --> 56:22.701
And you, Mrs. Green...

56:24.333 --> 56:28.366
possess that quality
in abundance.

56:32.953 --> 56:34.240
I would like...

56:36.220 --> 56:37.784
I would like to help.

56:42.719 --> 56:44.216
You make me believe...

56:45.814 --> 56:48.004
once more, in things...

56:51.166 --> 56:54.433
things I thought forgotten.

57:19.005 --> 57:22.204
Thank you for the tea, Mr. Brundish.
Everything was delicious.

57:23.002 --> 57:24.602
Well, please...

57:25.401 --> 57:27.764
come again when you wish.

57:28.217 --> 57:29.851
And good luck with, um...

57:30.928 --> 57:31.935
<i>Lolita.</i>

57:33.430 --> 57:34.821
Yes, thank you.

57:35.342 --> 57:38.088
I mustn't let myself worry. "Where
there's life, there's hope."

57:38.227 --> 57:41.633
God! What a horrifying thought.

57:47.750 --> 57:49.246
Yes.

57:52.580 --> 57:53.868
Thank you...

57:54.909 --> 57:56.925
for your advice, Mr. Brundish.

57:57.272 --> 57:58.525
My pleasure.

58:01.167 --> 58:04.710
Do you think <i>Dandelion Wine</i>
will be coming soon?

58:05.580 --> 58:09.613
I must say I can't thank you enough
for introducing me to Ray Bradbury.

58:10.516 --> 58:12.602
I'll have Wally bring it round.

58:15.799 --> 58:18.858
Or maybe I will bring it...

58:20.873 --> 58:21.811
to you.

58:25.565 --> 58:26.713
Well...

58:27.720 --> 58:29.250
I would like that very much.

59:12.663 --> 59:15.130
We've never had
so many of the same one before.

59:17.457 --> 59:19.023
Such a long one!

59:20.169 --> 59:22.079
This book is already famous,
Christine.

59:22.219 --> 59:24.026
Everybody has heard of it.

59:24.477 --> 59:28.823
Though I don't suppose they ever expected
to be able to buy it here in Hardborough.

59:30.074 --> 59:33.550
What they won't expect is to find
two hundred and fifty copies.

59:39.076 --> 59:41.197
You've really lost your head
over this one.

59:43.143 --> 59:46.028
<i>"4th of September, 1959:</i>

59:46.271 --> 59:48.114

personally affronted

01:01:00.233 --> 01:01:02.109

I can't think of
anything worse than living in London!

You know how I feel
about people.

I mean, look at this,
look at this!

01:02:57.609 --> 01:02:59.972
- It's absolutely stunning!
- Well, I'm not staying here.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:01.813
What do you mean
you're not staying...

01:03:01.953 --> 01:03:02.927
Where are you going?

01:03:03.065 --> 01:03:04.524
Oh, for goodness sake!

Do you have to just
keep storming off like a...?

01:03:20.026 --> 01:03:22.216
I'm just sick
of people like Violet!

01:03:22.356 --> 01:03:24.267
- What?
- I can't take it anymore, Milo!

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:27.603
Wait. Just be careful,
otherwise you're gonna slip!

01:03:27.882 --> 01:03:28.994
Hold on. Wait!

01:03:29.201 --> 01:03:30.488
Oh!

01:03:30.905 --> 01:03:33.268
What on earth are you doing
sitting there, Florence?

01:03:34.138 --> 01:03:36.849
I... I don't know why
I go out for walks.

01:03:36.988 --> 01:03:39.385
Walks are for pensioners,
and I should get to work.

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:40.846
Is there room on that step
for me?

01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:43.315
- Oh, yes, of course.
- I'm Kattie, Mrs. Green.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.677
- Florence.
- Milo's told me so much about you.

01:03:45.817 --> 01:03:49.535
Kattie wouldn't believe that there
were any nice spots in Hardborough,

01:03:49.674 --> 01:03:53.046
so I brought her out here
to see for herself.

01:03:53.531 --> 01:03:56.417
And what is it that you do
at the BBC, Kattie?

01:03:56.556 --> 01:03:58.502
- I work for the RPD...
- Oh.

01:03:58.642 --> 01:04:00.553
Recorded Programs Department.

01:04:00.763 --> 01:04:03.368
Monitoring expenses...
Not exactly exciting.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.933
Well...

01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:07.469
We've just been for lunch
with Violet Gamart.

01:04:08.096 --> 01:04:10.772
We gave her a chance to not
disapprove of us.

01:04:11.258 --> 01:04:13.553
Mrs. Gamart was very kind.

01:04:14.628 --> 01:04:15.881
Well, not really.

01:04:16.195 --> 01:04:18.767
I don't like kind people.

01:04:19.357 --> 01:04:21.304
Yeah, except for Florence.

01:04:22.624 --> 01:04:24.050
Don't flatter me.

01:04:31.173 --> 01:04:34.580
I get the feeling that you work
less and less every day.

01:04:35.242 --> 01:04:36.700
Don't forget the BBC
is a Corporation,

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.481
and that your salary is paid for
with public funding.

01:04:39.621 --> 01:04:40.871
Kattie deals with that.

01:04:41.183 --> 01:04:43.373
She is in charge of
my expenses sheet.

01:04:46.468 --> 01:04:48.379
Well...

01:04:49.179 --> 01:04:50.847
Are you not cold, my darling?

01:04:51.125 --> 01:04:54.323
Perhaps it's time we ought to
tootle off back to our humble abode

01:04:54.844 --> 01:04:57.764
and leave Florence alone,
lost in her thoughts.

01:04:59.501 --> 01:05:01.552
I think I'll stay here
a little longer.

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:03.394
As long as
I'm not bothering you.

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.480
No, not at all.

01:05:24.282 --> 01:05:26.159
Milo told me you're a widow.

01:05:26.438 --> 01:05:28.349
Yes. Yes, I am.

01:05:28.974 --> 01:05:30.295
"A Widow".

01:05:31.374 --> 01:05:35.788
Such a strange, dark word,
don't you think?

01:05:37.491 --> 01:05:39.540
My husband died, um...

01:05:39.749 --> 01:05:41.175
sixteen years ago.

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:45.414
How did you meet?

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:49.552
We met at a bookshop, actually.
In London.

01:05:53.479 --> 01:05:55.842
We were in love
from the first moment,

01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:58.102
We had to organize the, um...

01:05:58.345 --> 01:06:02.724
Organize and classify the poetry
section together at Muller's.

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:11.066
He used to read aloud to me
every night.

01:06:12.178 --> 01:06:15.515
Pepys and George Eliot,
and Thackeray...

01:06:16.626 --> 01:06:19.754
"Never give a lady
a restive horse".

01:06:22.952 --> 01:06:24.656
We loved that one.

01:06:27.645 --> 01:06:29.313
We were very happy...

01:06:30.147 --> 01:06:33.310
Busy doing a million things
and... Nothing.

01:06:34.492 --> 01:06:35.880
And then the war came.

01:06:36.403 --> 01:06:39.775
But I still have his letters,
all his letters, and I...

01:06:40.226 --> 01:06:42.206
I can still...

01:06:43.389 --> 01:06:46.934
hear his voice in my head
when I read them.

01:06:50.861 --> 01:06:53.540
Milo didn't do you justice when
he described you to me.

01:06:53.781 --> 01:06:56.874
Oh, dear.
Spare me from Milo's appraisal,

01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:59.169
I don't think I want to know
what he thinks of me.

01:06:59.342 --> 01:07:01.845
I still don't know
what he thinks of me.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.156
Or if he feels something for me.

01:07:07.683 --> 01:07:10.256
Or, for that matter, if he feels
anything at all.

01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:15.054
I guess that's part of
his thing.

01:07:16.686 --> 01:07:18.703
Keeping you guessing
all the time.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.281
You know what they say:

01:07:23.116 --> 01:07:24.853
with that kind of man,
you'll never know whether

01:07:24.993 --> 01:07:27.218
he's hiding
a rich inner world, or...

01:07:28.956 --> 01:07:30.417
absolutely nothing.

01:07:36.323 --> 01:07:38.131
He will never read aloud to me.

01:07:50.678 --> 01:07:52.035
Aunt Vi!

01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:04.164
So your bill is already having
its third reading. Excellent!

01:08:04.303 --> 01:08:07.919
And I have you to thank for
all your inspiration, Aunt Vi.

01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:09.656
Whatever do you mean?

01:08:09.866 --> 01:08:12.090
The idea came to me
during your party last spring.

01:08:12.332 --> 01:08:15.008
Your wonderful campaign in
favor of an arts center

01:08:15.148 --> 01:08:17.336
could become a reality
with a bill like this.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.326
And other communities could
benefit as well from...

01:08:20.673 --> 01:08:22.968
philanthropists
such as yourself.

01:08:23.627 --> 01:08:26.618
Well, I've only done
what I felt was right.

01:08:29.084 --> 01:08:31.448
The Access to Places
of Public Value Bill

01:08:31.586 --> 01:08:35.582
will make sure that town councils can
acquire their historic properties

01:08:35.723 --> 01:08:37.808
by compulsory purchase
for public use.

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:40.069
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Oh,

01:08:40.345 --> 01:08:42.571
I'm sure your father is smiling
down on us from heaven

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:44.587
with great pride at this very
moment.

01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:47.575
I'm so glad we arranged
to meet today, of all days.

01:08:47.716 --> 01:08:50.218
Precisely when the bill
has been approved.

01:08:51.606 --> 01:08:53.448
Do you fancy fish for lunch?

01:08:53.624 --> 01:08:55.395
I know a wonderful place
around the corner.

01:08:55.603 --> 01:08:58.453
I'm afraid living in Hardborough puts
you off eating fish anywhere else.

01:08:58.594 --> 01:09:00.227
It's so fresh down there!

01:09:00.366 --> 01:09:01.688
It's so true.

01:09:01.965 --> 01:09:03.321
A spot of tea, then?

01:09:03.876 --> 01:09:05.094
Perfect.

01:09:05.406 --> 01:09:07.560
Then I shall continue
with what I was doing.

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:10.654
I have a sick friend
who needs my attention.

01:09:10.932 --> 01:09:13.818
You're such a wonderful
and generous woman, Aunt Vi.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.376
- -MRS.
- Carry on with your work.

01:09:23.515 --> 01:09:24.904
Heads down.

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:29.631
Eyes down.
Keep... On with your work.

01:09:34.323 --> 01:09:36.202
No need to get up, children.

01:09:37.104 --> 01:09:38.321
I'm the Inspector.

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:39.781
No, you're not.

01:09:40.997 --> 01:09:44.126
I'm sorry, I...
I don't believe I know you.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:45.411
Mrs. Traill.

01:09:45.724 --> 01:09:47.010
The name is Sheppard.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.930
If you would be so kind,
you may examine my certificate

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:52.049
from the Ministry
of Education Authority,

01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:55.178
which authorizes me,
under the Shops Act of 1950,

01:09:55.629 --> 01:09:59.035
to visit any school where
I have cause to believe

01:09:59.175 --> 01:10:00.566
that there are children studying

01:10:00.703 --> 01:10:03.032
who also engage in
some sort of work.

01:10:03.172 --> 01:10:04.424
Work?

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.648
I can assure you
they'd all love to have a job,

01:10:07.308 --> 01:10:10.088
but outside of family businesses
and newspaper deliveries,

01:10:10.227 --> 01:10:12.417
you tell me what else
awaits them out there.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.017
And by the way,

01:10:14.398 --> 01:10:17.318
I don't remember you ever
visiting here before.

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.759
Well, due to staff shortages, our
visits are not quite as frequent

01:10:20.897 --> 01:10:22.394
as we would like them to be.

01:10:23.089 --> 01:10:25.140
So who suggested
you come this time?

01:10:33.236 --> 01:10:37.894
There is only one who
has a steady job after school.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:41.997
Christine Gipping,
who works regularly.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:43.629
Where?

01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:48.113
At the Old House bookshop.

01:10:49.921 --> 01:10:51.484
Stand up, Christine.

01:10:54.891 --> 01:10:56.907
If you'll excuse me.

01:10:57.636 --> 01:10:58.819
This is the girl.

01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:00.800
Miss, would you mind
coming with me?

01:11:11.886 --> 01:11:13.173
Good day.

01:11:13.625 --> 01:11:14.633
Good day.

01:11:32.845 --> 01:11:35.522
I don't want you to think
I hold anything against you.

01:11:36.077 --> 01:11:37.258
The law is the law.

01:11:37.398 --> 01:11:39.136
That's the main thing
I came to say.

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.088
Experience is important.

01:11:46.713 --> 01:11:49.841
The dropouts all say they won't hire us
without experience, but where can we get it?

01:11:50.084 --> 01:11:52.831
But we always tell Christine
that if she needs references

01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:54.534
she only has to come to you.

01:11:55.298 --> 01:11:58.426
Yes, of course.
All she has to do is ask.

01:11:59.399 --> 01:12:02.527
Christine's a wonderful girl,
Mrs. Gipping, and I'm...

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:06.317
very, very, very fond of her.

01:12:08.298 --> 01:12:12.642
But now she'll have an opportunity
to concentrate on her studies.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.666
She doesn't want to give up
earning money.

01:12:15.944 --> 01:12:17.717
No, of course not, but...

01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:20.775
I suppose after what happened
at the school, it's...

01:12:20.915 --> 01:12:22.826
Well, we've been
looking round a bit.

01:12:23.104 --> 01:12:25.780
And we hope they'll be hiring her to
work on Saturdays at the new bookshop.

01:12:31.584 --> 01:12:32.941
New bookshop?

01:12:33.252 --> 01:12:36.139
Yes, they will open very soon,
you know, in Deben's.

01:12:37.424 --> 01:12:38.780
The fish shop.

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:52.056
I had no idea.

01:12:52.194 --> 01:12:54.907
You really must keep an eye on
the competition, Mrs. Green.

01:12:56.886 --> 01:12:59.007
You'll give Christine those
references, won't you?

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:03.734
<i>She had no way
of knowing this,</i>

01:13:04.359 --> 01:13:08.600
<i>but the new bookshop was not
an enterprise like her own,</i>

01:13:09.191 --> 01:13:10.859
<i>but an investment,</i>

01:13:11.104 --> 01:13:13.676
<i>by the simple-minded
Lord Gosfield,</i>

01:13:13.814 --> 01:13:18.263
<i>on the advice of the General
and Mrs. Gamart.</i>

01:13:30.358 --> 01:13:33.974
- Thank you for coming, Mrs. Green.
- No need to thank me, Mr. Keble.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:38.353
Do you realize how
very little working capital

01:13:38.527 --> 01:13:39.952
- you have at present?
- Yes.

01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:41.550
It's rather difficult
not to notice.

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:43.566
I'd dare say things have taken
quite a dip

01:13:43.704 --> 01:13:45.511
in your business of late,
haven't they?

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.571
But I thought
you might like to know

01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:51.144
there's a possible buyer
for your shop.

01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:55.315
Thank you very much.

01:14:01.918 --> 01:14:02.892
Mr. Keble...

01:14:03.552 --> 01:14:06.332
The shop is not for sale.

01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:08.626
Message received.

01:14:09.285 --> 01:14:10.432
Thank you for coming.

01:14:10.711 --> 01:14:13.563
It has been
an incalculable help.

01:14:30.002 --> 01:14:30.906
Well...

01:14:34.206 --> 01:14:35.805
I really shall miss you.

01:14:37.648 --> 01:14:39.350
I don't want to go, you know?

01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:42.097
I don't want to work
in that other bookshop.

01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:45.121
My mother, she simply doesn't
understand...

01:14:45.259 --> 01:14:48.526
No, please.
You mustn't worry about that.

01:14:49.082 --> 01:14:50.229
How can I not worry?

01:14:50.473 --> 01:14:52.870
You can't run this place
by yourself.

01:14:53.393 --> 01:14:55.444
And no one in this village
will help you.

01:14:57.736 --> 01:14:58.779
No, I...

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:02.466
I shall manage, absolutely.
I... I shall manage.

01:15:05.836 --> 01:15:07.573
I do hope you'll come by

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.493
from time to time,
in the evenings, and...

01:15:10.771 --> 01:15:12.232
I won't have the time.

01:15:14.976 --> 01:15:16.367
Yes. No.

01:15:17.618 --> 01:15:19.914
No, of course you'll be...
You'll be busy.

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:26.099
I... I've got something for you.

01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:33.990
Now you won't have to wait
until my funeral.

01:15:37.985 --> 01:15:39.551
You're so kind, Mrs. Green.

01:15:43.617 --> 01:15:45.077
You're so bloody kind!

01:16:14.759 --> 01:16:17.992
Good afternoon, Florence...
Mrs. Green.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.730
Mr. Brundish.

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:24.004
How are things coming along,
down there?

01:16:25.603 --> 01:16:27.098
Um...

01:16:30.539 --> 01:16:33.285
I... I think you know
as well as I do, don't you?

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:37.107
Indeed, I do know. Some of it.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:40.896
What do you intend to do?

01:16:41.452 --> 01:16:42.600
Do?

01:16:46.178 --> 01:16:48.299
Is there anything I can do?

01:16:49.516 --> 01:16:50.629
Yes.

01:16:59.004 --> 01:16:59.908
No.

01:17:02.202 --> 01:17:03.176
Carry on.

01:17:04.809 --> 01:17:06.721
That's what I was going to do.

01:17:09.815 --> 01:17:11.517
Florence...

01:17:12.664 --> 01:17:16.278
I would very much like to have met
you at another time in my life.

01:17:17.181 --> 01:17:19.372
In another life, altogether.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:25.141
But I'm going to do what...

01:17:25.836 --> 01:17:28.895
small thing is in my power
to help you.

01:17:34.144 --> 01:17:38.384
Mr. Brundish, it's...

01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:42.798
It's very warming to hear
and I...

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.761
so appreciate. I, um...

01:17:48.324 --> 01:17:49.436
You mustn't...

01:17:49.888 --> 01:17:51.696
- There's nothing you...
- I...

01:17:51.974 --> 01:17:55.727
I will have a word with her.
I will talk to that woman.

01:17:56.076 --> 01:17:58.161
She might just listen.
She might...

01:18:00.072 --> 01:18:02.854
put an end to this loathsome
harassment.

01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:07.754
You'd really do that?

01:18:09.109 --> 01:18:10.430
Really?

01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:13.627
Come out of your seclusion
for me?

01:18:14.463 --> 01:18:16.166
Indeed I will.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.420
I don't know that it shall be
of much use, but I'm willing.

01:18:23.638 --> 01:18:26.140
I could just put a bullet
through her, but...

01:18:33.265 --> 01:18:35.802
...I'm not sure that would be
to your liking.

01:18:40.843 --> 01:18:43.101
I don't know how to ever
thank you. That's...

01:18:44.421 --> 01:18:46.229
That's the most, um...

01:18:49.774 --> 01:18:51.895
noble gesture...

01:18:52.972 --> 01:18:55.127
anyone has ever made for me.

01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:15.034
You work too hard, Florence.

01:20:15.659 --> 01:20:18.231
I try to concentrate.
Please, put these down.

01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:20.907
They've only just come in
and I haven't checked them yet.

01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:26.504
Surely you have to succeed
if you give everything you have.

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:28.553
I can't see why.

01:20:29.145 --> 01:20:31.716
Everyone gives everything
they have, eventually.

01:20:32.482 --> 01:20:35.400
We all die.
Dying is hardly success.

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.869
You're too young
to bother about dying.

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:42.040
I believe Kattie might snuff it.

01:20:42.631 --> 01:20:45.169
She...
She wastes so much energy.

01:20:45.376 --> 01:20:46.802
How is Kattie?

01:20:48.747 --> 01:20:49.964
No idea.

01:20:51.842 --> 01:20:54.448
As a matter of fact,
she's left me.

01:20:55.802 --> 01:20:58.409
She's, uh... She's gone to live
with someone else.

01:20:58.689 --> 01:20:59.731
In Wantage.

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:02.199
She's...

01:21:03.138 --> 01:21:04.805
He works in the World Service.

01:21:09.672 --> 01:21:12.696
I'm opening my heart to you.

01:21:16.518 --> 01:21:18.326
We are having a special moment,
aren't we?

01:21:22.914 --> 01:21:25.869
I expect you've told everyone else
in Hardborough who'd listen to you.

01:21:26.007 --> 01:21:28.509
But it affects you particularly,

01:21:28.649 --> 01:21:31.500
because I'll have so much more
free time as of now.

01:21:31.813 --> 01:21:35.879
I'll be able to work here,
part time, as your assistant.

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:39.285
I guess you must miss
that little girl.

01:21:45.471 --> 01:21:47.452
Christine learned a great deal
while she was here,

01:21:47.591 --> 01:21:49.989
and she was extremely nice
with the customers.

01:21:50.129 --> 01:21:51.728
Not as nice as I can be.

01:21:54.403 --> 01:21:55.585
So, um...

01:21:56.489 --> 01:21:59.026
How much can you pay me?

01:22:06.117 --> 01:22:08.168
I gave Christine twelve
shillings and six pence a week,

01:22:08.306 --> 01:22:11.331
and I don't feel able to offer any
more than that at the moment.

01:22:11.643 --> 01:22:13.554
If you're interested in the job,
you may come by

01:22:13.693 --> 01:22:16.022
in the afternoons
for a few weeks and try it out.

01:22:16.163 --> 01:22:17.414
Trial period.

01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:19.881
But please only remember
I didn't offer you the job.

01:22:20.019 --> 01:22:22.486
- You asked yourself.
- Has anyone ever told you

01:22:22.626 --> 01:22:24.851
you have
a marvelous pair of ankles?

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:26.831
Oh, do shut up.

01:22:27.805 --> 01:22:29.160
Go home!

01:22:51.405 --> 01:22:55.472
"Shower down thy love,
O burning bright!

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:01.206
For one night or the other night
Will come the Gardener in white,

01:23:02.596 --> 01:23:06.038
and Gathered flowers are dead."

01:23:06.558 --> 01:23:08.122
Christine!

01:23:08.505 --> 01:23:10.070
You'd better watch out,
Mr. North.

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:18.968
What unpleasant expressions
they teach you in that school!

01:23:19.315 --> 01:23:21.261
I didn't come here
to see people of...

01:23:21.643 --> 01:23:22.965
your sort.

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.388
Why, um...?

01:23:29.985 --> 01:23:32.454
Why are you not helping
Mrs. Green anymore?

01:23:33.288 --> 01:23:34.574
She misses you.

01:23:35.963 --> 01:23:38.849
She's got you, hasn't she?
You're always in and out.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:45.694
They say they won't let her keep
the bookshop.

01:23:46.007 --> 01:23:48.302
"They say"? Who say? You say?

01:23:48.442 --> 01:23:49.902
You know very well who.

01:23:50.596 --> 01:23:52.298
They have other plans
for the Old House.

01:23:52.473 --> 01:23:55.358
Why do you even care,
you little shrimp?

01:23:56.296 --> 01:23:57.896
They say she can't keep it,

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.361
they'll go after her.

01:24:00.606 --> 01:24:01.927
They'll take her to court.

01:24:02.274 --> 01:24:04.151
She'll have to swear
to tell truth,

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.002
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

01:24:07.244 --> 01:24:11.138
Hm. Well, we must hope that
it doesn't come to that.

01:24:12.597 --> 01:24:15.517
I never had time to sit around
when I was her assistant.

01:24:16.107 --> 01:24:19.271
No wonder. You're a child.

01:24:20.208 --> 01:24:21.252
Or a woman.

01:24:22.259 --> 01:24:25.144
Neither of them have any idea
how to relax.

01:24:25.909 --> 01:24:27.299
You'd just better watch out.

01:24:27.439 --> 01:24:30.184
I've come to get this.
It belongs to my mum.

01:25:24.857 --> 01:25:26.214
Thank you.

01:25:34.135 --> 01:25:35.598
Give me a moment.

01:26:01.873 --> 01:26:05.002
What a pleasant surprise,
Mr. Brundish.

01:26:05.697 --> 01:26:07.922
Um, please, have a seat.

01:26:10.979 --> 01:26:12.093
Thank you.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.314
I have come to ask you
something.

01:26:18.452 --> 01:26:20.572
I don't know if this is
the proper way to do so,

01:26:20.711 --> 01:26:22.242
but I can't think of
a better one.

01:26:22.484 --> 01:26:24.674
If you're not in the mood
for questions,

01:26:24.813 --> 01:26:26.482
you should say so now.

01:26:27.802 --> 01:26:29.715
Would you like some tea?

01:26:30.965 --> 01:26:33.919
I... I don't want your tea.

01:26:34.613 --> 01:26:37.569
I want you to leave
Florence Green alone.

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.844
- Did she ask you to come see me?
- Certainly not.

01:26:42.991 --> 01:26:46.848
She's simply a woman who wants
to keep a bookshop.

01:26:47.961 --> 01:26:49.873
If Mrs. Green has reason
to complain,

01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:52.167
I suppose she should
turn to a solicitor.

01:26:52.515 --> 01:26:55.642
Though I believe she's rather given
to changing her legal advisors.

01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:58.908
The bookshop is draughty, impossible
to mortgage a second time,

01:26:59.048 --> 01:27:00.543
and, from what I've heard, damp.

01:27:00.681 --> 01:27:02.663
Leave her alone. The woman has
done nothing to you.

01:27:03.914 --> 01:27:05.304
Has it not occurred to you,

01:27:05.617 --> 01:27:08.258
as someone who must be
extremely concerned

01:27:08.572 --> 01:27:10.866
about the welfare
and the future of this place,

01:27:11.177 --> 01:27:14.724
that a building of such historical
interest could be put to a better use?

01:27:15.106 --> 01:27:18.164
Old age is not the same thing
as historical interest.

01:27:18.302 --> 01:27:21.189
Otherwise you and I would be far
more interesting than we are.

01:27:21.397 --> 01:27:24.908
I repeat, I want you to leave my
friend Florence Green alone.

01:27:25.046 --> 01:27:26.542
Alone!

01:27:32.518 --> 01:27:38.289
Well it appears your friend has failed
to take the law into consideration,

01:27:38.949 --> 01:27:42.077
something which I have observed
on several occasions.

01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:44.997
If that is the case, I can have
nothing to say in the matter.

01:27:45.276 --> 01:27:47.013
The law will have to take
its course.

01:27:47.152 --> 01:27:49.585
Are you referring to a law that
didn't exist a year ago,

01:27:49.724 --> 01:27:52.539
and that Parliament approved
behind our backs?

01:27:52.955 --> 01:27:55.458
I'm talking about an order for
compulsory purchase.

01:27:55.598 --> 01:27:57.648
Or an eviction,
which is the proper term.

01:27:57.788 --> 01:28:00.602
Did you put your precious nephew
up to drafting that bill?

01:28:00.847 --> 01:28:04.530
I won't deny my nephew's bill
may affect the bookshop,

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:08.528
as it is essential the premises must
have remained empty for five years.

01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:11.621
That would undoubtedly apply
to the Old House.

01:28:11.898 --> 01:28:17.076
But there are so many regulations
to be considered, Mr. Brundish.

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:21.283
Ordinary mortals like myself,
and of course like you,

01:28:21.769 --> 01:28:23.646
would hardly know
where to begin.

01:28:23.925 --> 01:28:26.427
I am in politics,
and subsequently,

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.755
am fairly familiar with
bureaucracy,

01:28:28.894 --> 01:28:30.632
but this goes way beyond me.

01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:35.360
We wouldn't even know how to find
the right person to write to.

01:28:35.568 --> 01:28:38.591
Madam, I know perfectly well
who to write to.

01:28:38.939 --> 01:28:41.685
Over the past years, if I hadn't
made it my business to know,

01:28:41.825 --> 01:28:44.258
I would have lost several
hundred acres of marshes,

01:28:44.397 --> 01:28:46.551
some farming land and two
pumping mills.

01:28:46.932 --> 01:28:50.514
This is why I am certain that,
if nothing has been done so far,

01:28:50.652 --> 01:28:53.710
we can still form a common front
against them.

01:28:55.102 --> 01:28:58.543
We can certainly think of ways
of making the move easier,

01:28:58.682 --> 01:29:00.038
if it is actually made.

01:29:00.557 --> 01:29:03.339
There are still plenty of other
places to let

01:29:03.478 --> 01:29:06.257
in larger towns than
Hardborough.

01:29:06.398 --> 01:29:07.927
That's not what I'm talking...

01:29:08.066 --> 01:29:10.847
You should be talking about
what I am talking about!

01:29:24.957 --> 01:29:26.904
I wish I could do
something more.

01:29:30.589 --> 01:29:33.127
I assume, then,
that you intend to do nothing.

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:44.839
But you mustn't speak to me
that way, Mr. Brundish.

01:29:48.454 --> 01:29:50.851
You don't realize
what you are saying.

01:29:51.756 --> 01:29:54.328
You seem to think
I'm an outrageous person.

01:29:54.952 --> 01:29:56.100
Is that it?

01:29:59.435 --> 01:30:01.661
I can't answer that question
"yes" or "no."

01:30:02.461 --> 01:30:06.006
I suspect that by "outrageous" you
mean "unexpectedly offensive."

01:30:06.145 --> 01:30:09.308
And the truth is that you have
been fairly offensive, but also...

01:30:11.741 --> 01:30:14.278
repulsive, Mrs. Gamart.

01:30:15.286 --> 01:30:18.553
That is, you have behaved
exactly as I expected.

01:34:02.492 --> 01:34:04.334
Good afternoon, General.

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:07.568
You wouldn't like a book,
would you?

01:34:10.173 --> 01:34:12.017
Not exactly. Um...

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.108
I just came to say...

01:34:17.577 --> 01:34:19.316
A good man has left us.

01:34:25.049 --> 01:34:26.579
I believe...

01:34:26.892 --> 01:34:29.881
you knew Edmund Brundish
quite well, did you not?

01:34:31.410 --> 01:34:32.696
I feel as though I did, but...

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:35.823
Well I never crossed words
with him at all.

01:34:36.867 --> 01:34:39.023
He was in the first mess,
of course.

01:34:40.447 --> 01:34:42.011
But not in the Suffolks.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.677
He signed up for the Air Force,
I believe.

01:34:50.073 --> 01:34:51.569
He wanted to fly.

01:34:52.751 --> 01:34:53.897
How odd.

01:34:57.825 --> 01:35:01.578
It was also odd that he came
to see us that very morning.

01:35:02.308 --> 01:35:06.132
He wanted to speak to your wife,
I imagine.

01:35:06.931 --> 01:35:08.148
Yes, you're quite right.

01:35:08.285 --> 01:35:10.442
Violet told me all about it.

01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:17.706
He made a great effort
to go see her...

01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:21.807
to congratulate her on her idea.

01:35:25.178 --> 01:35:29.036
I'm referring to
the arts center.

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:35.850
Hm. I'm sorry I...

01:35:36.196 --> 01:35:38.456
didn't get a chance to
speak to him.

01:35:41.445 --> 01:35:45.059
I must say, I would never
have imagined him

01:35:45.338 --> 01:35:48.015
being interested in art.

01:35:50.342 --> 01:35:51.734
But, well...

01:35:54.722 --> 01:35:57.017
A good man has left us. Hm.

01:36:01.986 --> 01:36:05.393
Anyone could suffer an attack
like that, if you, uh...

01:36:06.123 --> 01:36:08.696
If you think about it. Hm.

01:36:14.081 --> 01:36:17.001
You mustn't be late
for your lunch party, General.

01:36:20.269 --> 01:36:22.459
Leave my house
and don't ever come back.

01:36:25.169 --> 01:36:26.558
And please...

01:36:27.394 --> 01:36:30.730
don't you or your wife
ever again malign

01:36:31.148 --> 01:36:33.339
a man who had more dignity...

01:36:34.658 --> 01:36:36.501
sensitivity...

01:36:38.064 --> 01:36:39.177
and compassion,

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:42.131
than either of you will have
in your entire...

01:36:47.831 --> 01:36:49.674
Don't ever say his name again.

01:36:54.329 --> 01:36:55.790
And forget mine.

01:37:02.117 --> 01:37:03.229
But she...

01:37:04.861 --> 01:37:06.914
- Violet...
- Leave!

01:37:17.688 --> 01:37:20.328
So it seems that
I have been evicted

01:37:20.606 --> 01:37:22.622
by the city of Flintmarket.

01:37:22.831 --> 01:37:25.717
As we mentioned during
our last phone conversation,

01:37:25.994 --> 01:37:27.975
it seems there is
a new Parliament bill

01:37:28.114 --> 01:37:29.886
l which allows
Flintmarket Council

01:37:30.025 --> 01:37:32.945
to take over ownership
of the Old House.

01:37:33.224 --> 01:37:33.953
Yes.

01:37:34.544 --> 01:37:37.047
And I should like to know,
if I may,

01:37:37.358 --> 01:37:40.730
where the Council obtained
the funds necessary

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:42.191
to throw me out.

01:37:42.954 --> 01:37:45.771
They apparently
found a benefactor.

01:37:45.909 --> 01:37:48.969
What concerns me
is if the Old House is

01:37:49.106 --> 01:37:50.914
considered to be
habitable or not.

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:54.565
If it turns out that it is unfit
for human habitation,

01:37:54.738 --> 01:37:56.963
or indeed subsidence
is threatened...

01:37:57.345 --> 01:38:00.126
Well, then it will be impossible
to demand compensation.

01:38:00.647 --> 01:38:01.723
You won't see a penny.

01:38:02.349 --> 01:38:06.243
I'm inhabiting it,
and I'm still human.

01:38:08.745 --> 01:38:10.343
It's not even as damp
as all that.

01:38:10.482 --> 01:38:13.783
In the summer it's really quite
dry, and in midwinter it's...

01:38:13.924 --> 01:38:16.253
Here is an inspection
of the cellars,

01:38:16.531 --> 01:38:17.990
according to which,

01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:21.257
the property is standing
in half an inch of water.

01:38:23.899 --> 01:38:26.576
Sorry, wh...
What inspection? I...

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.546
I wasn't informed of any
inspection, I don't think.

01:38:31.683 --> 01:38:33.840
Apparently on several occasions

01:38:33.979 --> 01:38:35.785
when you were absent
from the property,

01:38:35.925 --> 01:38:37.975
an expert in masonry
and plastering,

01:38:38.115 --> 01:38:40.131
a Mr. John Gipping,

01:38:40.617 --> 01:38:45.135
was sent by the council to inspect the
condition of the walls and the cellars.

01:38:46.005 --> 01:38:49.028
John Gipping?
Christine's father?

01:38:49.792 --> 01:38:52.433
We assume he entered peaceably.

01:38:52.573 --> 01:38:54.938
I don't remember
letting him in myself.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:58.900
Oh, your assistant,
Mr. Milo North.

01:38:59.698 --> 01:39:01.854
Everyone will assume
he acted as your servant,

01:39:01.993 --> 01:39:04.044
and was following
your instructions.

01:39:05.816 --> 01:39:07.103
Have you any...

01:39:08.179 --> 01:39:09.256
comments?

01:39:23.230 --> 01:39:25.315
- No.
- What leaves us in a difficult position

01:39:25.454 --> 01:39:29.277
is the fact that Mr. North has
also signed a statement,

01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:30.771
according to which,

01:39:31.016 --> 01:39:32.822
the level of dampness
in the property

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.526
has affected his health,

01:39:35.186 --> 01:39:40.295
making him unable to accept
any type of ordinary employment.

01:40:16.999 --> 01:40:18.076
Why?

01:40:20.855 --> 01:40:22.281
There is no why.

01:40:23.881 --> 01:40:27.704
They asked me persistently,
so, you know...

01:40:27.947 --> 01:40:30.763
I just simply thought...
I'd best do it.

01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:34.933
Oh, if you're looking for
a new assistant,

01:40:35.489 --> 01:40:37.052
I understand
Christine is available.

01:40:37.192 --> 01:40:40.147
She, uh... She's no longer
working at the new bookshop.

01:40:40.668 --> 01:40:42.163
She...

01:40:43.031 --> 01:40:45.847
She tried to sell <i>Lolita</i>
to... to the vicar!

01:40:48.489 --> 01:40:49.531
Florence!

01:44:03.404 --> 01:44:05.491
Mrs. Green!
Mrs. Green!

01:44:05.733 --> 01:44:07.645
- Christine.
- Mrs. Green.

01:44:09.661 --> 01:44:11.017
Mrs. Green.

01:44:11.155 --> 01:44:12.338
Bye.

01:44:16.056 --> 01:44:17.099
Mrs. Green...

01:44:17.238 --> 01:44:18.141
<i>For years to come,</i>

01:44:18.801 --> 01:44:20.888
<i>I will remember
how she tried to smile</i>

01:44:21.027 --> 01:44:23.148
<i>looking at the book
I had in my hands.</i>

01:44:28.882 --> 01:44:30.829
<i>Then, she realized</i>

01:44:31.036 --> 01:44:32.705
<i>what I had done.</i>

01:44:57.034 --> 01:44:59.572
<i>She had fulfilled the dream</i>

01:45:00.164 --> 01:45:02.423
<i>and they'd snatched it
away from her.</i>

01:45:03.672 --> 01:45:06.071
<i>But what she possessed deep down</i>

01:45:06.210 --> 01:45:09.618
<i>was something no one
could ever take away from her:</i>

01:45:10.659 --> 01:45:11.947
<i>her courage.</i>

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.720
<i>And it was that courage
and her passion for books</i>

01:45:23.103 --> 01:45:24.979
<i>that she bequeathed to me,</i>

01:45:25.778 --> 01:45:28.734
<i>along with the Chinese lacquerd
tray.</i>

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:48.371
<i>How right she was when she said
that no one ever feels alone</i>

01:45:49.136 --> 01:45:50.596
<i>in a bookshop.</i>
