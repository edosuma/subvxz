[cell phone vibrates]

00:31.531 --> 00:32.574
[Clay] Hello?

00:32.657 --> 00:35.618
[distorted voice]  One ring.
You need to pick up on one ring.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.912
[Clay] Or what?
How do you have this number?

00:38.288 --> 00:41.207
[distorted voice]
You'll find out.   I'll see you in school.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.459
[dial tone beeps]

00:43.043 --> 00:45.545
[Clay]  So, yeah, it's Valentine's Day.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.631
They're calling the dance
"Love is Love," which, like...

00:49.174 --> 00:51.301
Here's the thing
about love in high school.

00:51.968 --> 00:55.305
Love does not thrive in an atmosphere
of complete paranoia.

00:55.388 --> 00:59.642
So anyone who thinks Valentine's Day
at a high school is a genuine show of love

00:59.726 --> 01:04.189
probably also thinks that airport security
actually has anything to do with security.

01:04.689 --> 01:07.776
What the fuck with all the cameras?
They're everywhere.   Look.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.820
It's probably just the vandalism, right?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.656
They didn't put any up
after the baseball field, that was worse.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.784
Dude, most high schools
have security cameras now.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.244
This is different. Something's up.
They know something.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.956
Dude, you have been spiraling for weeks.
You gotta stop.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.333
No, you've been ignoring shit

01:23.416 --> 01:26.711
in your little "I'm happy,
I'm healthy" bubble, but shit is wrong.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.922
-[cell vibrates]
-This is the third time this morning.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.507
-Gonna answer?
-It's just a robocall.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.593
-Why don't you block the num--
-They're calling from different numbers.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.970
Why is a robocall freaking you out?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.138
[tense music plays]

01:37.222 --> 01:38.515
I gotta get to class.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.311
What?

01:43.394 --> 01:45.980
[distorted voice]  We talked about
what happens if you don't pick up.

01:46.064 --> 01:49.526
-You know the rules.
-No, I don't know the fucking rules.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.779
All I know is you've called me 15 times
since last night, and I don't know why!

01:53.196 --> 01:54.239
Come on, you know.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.448
No, I don't.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.450
Well, you'll find out.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.576
Who are you?

01:59.077 --> 02:02.747
That you won't find out
unless you fail to answer when we call,

02:02.831 --> 02:04.874
and then, shit rains down.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.709
Why? What are you gonna do?

02:06.793 --> 02:11.005
No, Clay, the real question is,
what are you going to do?

02:12.173 --> 02:13.174
What do you mean?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.845
Answer when we call, and learn.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.264
[dial tone beeps]

02:33.862 --> 02:35.488
I know what you're gonna say.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.116
-Um... about?
-Valentine's Day.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.953
I hate dances,
stupid hearts of paper, whatever...

02:42.036 --> 02:44.539
-But here's the thing--
-Um, can you walk with me?

02:44.622 --> 02:45.915
-Yeah, I can.
-OK.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.086
I'm facing the reality
that I may graduate from high school

02:50.170 --> 02:51.963
without certain experiences

02:52.046 --> 02:54.215
that at one time,
I thought I didn't need to have,

02:54.299 --> 02:56.217
but now I'm thinking I might like to have.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.761
I mean,
I've had some interesting experiences,

02:59.262 --> 03:01.806
and some things
that would've been fine to miss,

03:01.890 --> 03:03.850
but there are certain things
I don't want to miss.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.896
You know, like normal things,
like... being asked to a dance

03:07.979 --> 03:12.609
and going to a dance
with someone who... asks me.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.693
I have to go.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.237
-Um, in there, right now, alone. Sorry.
-OK.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.990
Um... but good talk. I'll see you, OK?

03:23.661 --> 03:25.038
[eerie music plays]

03:35.423 --> 03:36.716
[exhales heavily]

03:42.805 --> 03:44.432
[cell phone vibrates]

03:49.145 --> 03:50.855
Come on, Winston. I know it's you.

03:51.439 --> 03:55.068
[distorted voice]  Winston?
Who the fuck is Winston?

03:55.860 --> 03:58.071
Don't you recognize
the fucking phone number?

03:59.822 --> 04:02.533
Yes, but... who is this?

04:03.284 --> 04:04.285
What do you want?

04:04.827 --> 04:06.704
I want you to do what I say,

04:07.830 --> 04:08.957
or I go public...

04:10.291 --> 04:11.876
with proof that Monty is innocent.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.088
-That's not possible.   You don't have it.
-You think so?

04:15.546 --> 04:17.215
Obviously, we have his phone.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.009
What's on a phone, Clay?

04:21.219 --> 04:24.013
Texts, emails, pictures.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.474
That's bullshit. [inhales deeply]

04:26.766 --> 04:29.269
There's no... He...
You're a fucking liar.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.396
Clay, that hurts my feelings.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.524
You shouldn't do that. Come on.
It's not a good idea.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.234

-[clattering]

04:36.317 --> 04:37.527
[lock clicks closed]

04:37.860 --> 04:38.861
[Clay] Hey!

04:42.156 --> 04:42.991
Hey!

04:44.450 --> 04:46.828
Hey, open the door!

04:47.412 --> 04:49.372
-Fuck you! Open the door!
-[door rattles]

04:50.123 --> 04:51.749

04:52.542 --> 04:53.418
Fuck.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.076
[gasps echoing] No!

05:27.744 --> 05:30.705
Please, let me out! Please!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.166
Please!

05:33.249 --> 05:34.375
It wasn't me!

05:34.917 --> 05:36.627
[panting]

05:37.712 --> 05:39.630
Clay, what's wrong?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.175
Hey.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.593
I, uh...

05:45.678 --> 05:46.804
I locked myself in.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.973
Well, the lock's busted right now,

05:49.057 --> 05:51.476
but, I mean,
I guess it gets stuck sometimes.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.396
-What are you even doing in here?
-I was, uh...

05:57.148 --> 05:58.566
I was looking for Winston.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.652
You were?

06:03.446 --> 06:06.532
Well, he's not here until fourth.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.203
I can tell him that you're looking for him
if you want.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.038
No.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.332
No, it's all good, man.

06:15.875 --> 06:16.709
Clay!

06:18.503 --> 06:20.588
Everything's OK, right?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.383
Yeah, man. Everything's good.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.387
[Clay]  No, I don't think total paranoia
is an overstatement at all.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.347
I'm just saying.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.433
I do think there is a thing where
the cameras make it safer around here.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.060
It's an invasion of privacy.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.603
[Jess] Yeah, OK,

06:35.686 --> 06:37.897
but maybe it'll stop bad shit
from happening.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.690
Well, anymore.

06:42.652 --> 06:46.114
And speaking of our safety,
I was actually thinking,

06:47.073 --> 06:49.409
what if we went to the dance
tomorrow night as a group?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.285
Yeah.

06:51.869 --> 06:53.329
[Jess] Strength in numbers.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.873
And it sends a good message, you know?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.083
We don't have to wait around

06:57.166 --> 06:59.627
for some guy
to ask us out on a date, right?

07:00.503 --> 07:01.421
Who's with me?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.631
[pop music plays quietly]

07:11.222 --> 07:12.974
Wait, you guys all have dates?

07:15.726 --> 07:17.645
I mean, no, that's good for you guys.

07:19.063 --> 07:19.897
Sick.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.943
I don't... have a date.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.028
Wanna go together?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.113
What about Clay?

07:27.738 --> 07:29.532
Not interested, apparently.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.284
That's messed up.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.078
This whole thing is messed up.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.831
I'm the fucking president of the school.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.959
I'm a female powerhouse,
and I can't even get a fucking date.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.545
[sighs] Boys suck!

07:42.628 --> 07:44.839
Yeah, but we already knew that.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.679
It's kinda messed up,
like, they install the cameras

07:51.762 --> 07:53.264
the day before Valentine's Day?

07:53.347 --> 07:54.474
What is that about?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.100
It's all performative, really.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.561
You can't tell the difference
between true love

07:58.644 --> 08:00.229
and a really good couple selfie.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.857
-Sure, you can. A selfie lasts forever.
-Ouch!

08:02.940 --> 08:05.026
But, Alex, love is love.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.987
Who knows what love even is?

08:08.779 --> 08:09.739
It's love.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.575
-It's on the poster.
-[scoffs]

08:12.658 --> 08:14.410
I mean, we just waste so much time

08:14.494 --> 08:17.413
going through these motions
of, like, romance,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.374
and Valentine's Day is a whole day
that we're never gonna get back.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.170
What would you rather waste your time
doing on Valentine's Day?

08:24.879 --> 08:28.966
Well, I think Tyler mentioned that there
is some slasher marathon at Crestmont.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.259
Maybe we could all go?

08:30.968 --> 08:33.638
I wish I could,
but I'm obligated to document

08:33.721 --> 08:36.349
dance-related lameness tomorrow night
for yearbook.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.809
I could hang tonight, though.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.854
I think that Tyler said
he had plans, right?

08:42.271 --> 08:43.147
Right.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.609
But, well, we could do something?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.529
You know, just, like, the two of us.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.323
I mean, unless you have plans too?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.158
Yeah.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.619
I mean, like, no. [chuckles]

08:57.328 --> 08:59.997
I mean, like, yeah, I would be...
I'm cool with that.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.290
OK, then.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.417
Cool.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.211
Cool.

09:06.587 --> 09:09.590
Dude, where have you been?
I've left you, like, six messages.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.260
Sorry, I have just been so busy.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.554
-Chloe called me.
-Why?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.889
Because she's worried about you.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.559
Apparently, you haven't been
returning her calls either,

09:19.642 --> 09:21.227
so should I be worried about you too?

09:21.310 --> 09:24.021
I didn't tell her shit,
if that's what you're worried about.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.859
-It isn't.
-I can't tell anybody anything, ever.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.696
-So, we good?
-[locker slams shut]

09:32.363 --> 09:34.031
-You can tell me.
-Oh...

09:34.532 --> 09:36.951
Justin, since when do you give a shit?

09:38.953 --> 09:43.916
Look, there's this workshop, uh,
this afternoon with the whole team. You...

09:45.167 --> 09:46.210
You should come by.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.338
What for? You're the captain now, bud.

09:49.422 --> 09:53.009
I'm just co-captain,
and it's just to help Charlie out.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.885
Also, you know Kerba made us.

09:54.969 --> 09:55.928
-OK.
-Zach.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.765
Zach, I wouldn't even be on this team

09:59.849 --> 10:03.144
if it weren't for you taking the time
to give a shit about me when I needed it.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.606
Fine.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.274
I'll be there.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.818
Nope, sorry, hard pass.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.236
What, even as friends?

10:12.320 --> 10:15.072
Who literally never speak
until you need something.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.783
You're really calling me out today.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.369
Look, you're the one
who stopped talking to me,

10:20.453 --> 10:23.039
and we had, like,
one week of Monet's after Thanksgiving,

10:23.122 --> 10:25.249
and then you just completely dropped me.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.168
I did not drop you. I just...

10:27.251 --> 10:29.712
I can't think about it too much,
or I freak out.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.381
Look, I get that.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.009
-Of all people?
-I know.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.347
I'm still not going to the dance with you.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.389
Even as friends?

10:44.518 --> 10:46.103
Do you already have a date?

10:46.479 --> 10:49.398
No, and thanks for seeming shocked
at the possibility.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.777
Why do you wanna go so bad, anyway?

10:52.860 --> 10:57.657
Because... I'm the student body president,
and I should be there.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.242
-So go alone.
-And I shouldn't have to go alone.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.703
You know, what good is it
to have our lives back

11:02.787 --> 11:05.706
if we can't, you know, live?

11:06.540 --> 11:07.375
[Alex] Yeah.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.251
I hear you.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.301
[Clay]  It's high school,
so somebody's always watching,

11:17.385 --> 11:18.761
waiting for you to fuck up.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.055
So, of course, you will.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.557
[ominous music plays]

11:23.641 --> 11:24.975
[cell phone vibrates]

11:43.327 --> 11:46.831
[distorted voice]  Wow,
you really are running scared, aren't you?

11:47.331 --> 11:49.792
At least I'm not a coward
hiding behind a phone.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.127
I'm not hiding.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.503
I'm right here.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.510
Well, there's an empty seat.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.804
Why don't you join me?

12:01.887 --> 12:04.181
Why? So you can come
and punch me in the face?

12:04.598 --> 12:07.476
No, I think you should be the one
to take the beatdown.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.439
So, I want you to pick a fight,
and you can't hit back.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.232
You have five minutes.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.485
Five...   Wait, seriously?
How am I suppo--

12:16.569 --> 12:18.028
-[dial tone beeps]
-Hello?

12:25.536 --> 12:27.538
[tense music plays]

12:38.632 --> 12:40.634
I know this doesn't make sense,
but hit me.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.053
-I need you to punch me hard.
-What? No.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.141
-Dude.
-Please? I need you to hit me.

12:47.224 --> 12:50.144
Seriously, I don't know what's going on,
but I'm not fucking hitting you.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.562
Is it because of your leg?

12:51.645 --> 12:53.939
Or did you promise your girlfriend Chloe
you wouldn't fight?

12:54.023 --> 12:55.691
Sorry, Bryce's girlfriend Chloe.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.403
Oh, come on. You were OK
with beating the shit out of Bryce.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.989
Now you're a pussy?
Is that what you are, huh?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.033
A pussy?

13:05.451 --> 13:06.410
Bitch.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.956
[Clay grunts]

13:11.791 --> 13:12.875
Again, pussy.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.504
[Clay groans]

13:16.587 --> 13:17.963
[Clay coughs wheezily]

13:18.047 --> 13:20.758
Well, Clay,
you've got to get your shit together.

13:20.841 --> 13:21.842
[Clay grumbles]

13:22.885 --> 13:23.928
You're one to talk.

13:24.386 --> 13:28.682
No, see, I'm fucking up my own life.
You're taking all of us down with you.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.518
Figure it out.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.102
I don't care how.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.482
[pained gasping]

13:41.028 --> 13:42.696
[cell phone vibrates]

13:48.911 --> 13:51.580
[distorted voice]  I'm impressed.
Keep it up.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.166
-[strained breathing]
-[dial tone beeps]

13:56.669 --> 14:00.464
Dude...
you flaked on me two weeks in a row.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.674
So what's going on?

14:02.591 --> 14:03.425
Nothing.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.970
I mean, just busy.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.556
Busy with what?

14:10.140 --> 14:12.518
School. And my job.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.396
You have a job?

14:16.021 --> 14:16.856
Yes.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.649
Uh, where?

14:19.191 --> 14:21.026
At the Ultimate Portrait Studio.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.197
I have a life. I can't just be there
whenever you need me.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.199
Yeah, OK, of course.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.911
Tyler Down, you're wanted in the office.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.998
-Is everything OK?
-Yeah.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.457
Tyler?

14:35.541 --> 14:38.127
Just Dr. Singh, as always.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.171
[Tyler] Thank you.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.090
[door opens]

14:44.758 --> 14:45.759
[door closes]

14:48.012 --> 14:48.846
Bathroom?

14:51.056 --> 14:52.933
[breathing heavily]

14:54.852 --> 14:57.855
Antonio Padilla, out of class.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.192
-I have a hall pass.
-For?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.862
-For the bathroom.
-Which you just blew past.

15:04.945 --> 15:05.779
Let me see.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.324
Come on, man.
I really don't have time for this shit.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.619
And here I got all the time in the world,
'cause, hey, that's my job.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.079
Ooh!

15:16.123 --> 15:17.625
What are you gonna do with that?

15:23.631 --> 15:24.465
Nothing.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.508
Put that fighting instinct to good use.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.554
Fight for me.

15:31.805 --> 15:32.765
Fight for you?

15:32.848 --> 15:35.059
-I don't understand.
-East County Pro-Am.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.477
It's a little independent league.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.397
Myself, some guys from the department,
firefighters, some talented kids.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.482
Hey, Ted?

15:42.149 --> 15:45.110
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, there's no problem, Deputy.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.737
-Antonio here...
-Tony.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.824
...was thinking about
maybe fighting pro-am.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.494
I'm betting he's got the goods.
I'll be in touch.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.120
I'll get you those details.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.669
Is there something you need, Tony?

16:02.920 --> 16:08.509
Uh... No, sir. I was, uh, just looking
for Tyler. He left his book in class.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.470
Oh, he's in with Principal Bolan now,
so...

16:12.221 --> 16:13.597
He's with Principal Bolan?

16:13.973 --> 16:17.685
Yeah, and I'm headed in there myself.
I could bring Tyler his book for you.

16:18.852 --> 16:19.728
Uh...

16:20.270 --> 16:22.690
No, that's OK.
I'm gonna see him later. Um...

16:23.482 --> 16:24.900
I'm gonna get back to class.

16:25.609 --> 16:26.443
[Bill] OK.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.823
[indistinct message over radio]

16:35.911 --> 16:39.832
[Clay]  But even under all that pressure,
we still try to be a human being.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.667
We try to believe in romance.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.044
So I'm an idiot.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.674
I don't disagree,
but could you please be more specific?

16:49.633 --> 16:51.885
You asked me to the dance earlier.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.431
I was all up in my head,
and I need to get out of my head

16:55.931 --> 16:58.684
and be a human being, so...

17:08.193 --> 17:09.194
[Ani chuckles]

17:10.487 --> 17:12.906
Well, you might be quite awkward
with your words,

17:12.990 --> 17:16.952
especially when it comes
to attempting absolute honesty,

17:17.036 --> 17:20.289
but... you do have a way
with your pictures.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.375
[romantic music plays]

17:26.962 --> 17:29.840
Doesn't look like I have
much of a choice though, do I?

17:29.923 --> 17:32.259
Well, that was kind of the idea.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.765
But like you said,
normal people go to dances,

17:38.599 --> 17:39.475
so...

17:41.060 --> 17:42.352
will you be normal with me?

17:47.608 --> 17:48.942
[cell phone vibrates]

18:03.582 --> 18:04.458
[Ani] Clay?

18:05.918 --> 18:06.835
Clay?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.634
[ringtone sounds]

18:15.594 --> 18:16.470
Clay, what's wrong?

18:21.475 --> 18:22.768
[ringtone gets louder]

18:23.727 --> 18:25.187
[tense music plays]

18:25.270 --> 18:26.563
[ringtone continues]

18:28.816 --> 18:30.192
[exhales in determination]

18:31.276 --> 18:32.945
Got you! I fucking got you!

18:33.821 --> 18:36.365
[woman]  Julie? Sweetheart, are you OK?

18:37.491 --> 18:38.325
Julie?

18:39.618 --> 18:40.661
Sorry. Uh...

18:41.328 --> 18:44.957
He just gets really upset when people
break the whole no-cellphones rule.

18:47.126 --> 18:47.960
Come with me!

18:48.043 --> 18:49.378
[Clay breathes heavily]

18:51.296 --> 18:52.840
[shocked murmuring]

18:54.800 --> 18:55.968
What the hell was that?

18:56.051 --> 18:57.302
And don't say nothing,

18:57.386 --> 18:59.638
because it's never nothing
and you know it.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.390
-Someone has Monty's phone.
-What?

19:01.890 --> 19:03.308
How is that even possible?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.060
They've been harassing me for two weeks,

19:05.144 --> 19:07.729
sending me FaceTimes as proof.
Last night, they started calling.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.648
-They?
-They, him, someone.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.943
-The voice is disguised.
-Then how do you know it's Monty's phone?

19:15.445 --> 19:18.198
[voicemail]  Hey, it's Monty.
Leave a message. I'll hit you back.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.409
Jesus, why didn't you tell me?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.369
Because I didn't know
if it was a real thing.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.912
What do you mean, "a real thing"?

19:23.996 --> 19:28.083
I mean, I didn't know
if it was anything... important.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.335
I just...   Until they started calling me.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.378
Last night?

19:32.629 --> 19:34.173
And they said they have proof.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.842
If I don't do what they say,
they'll make it public.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.218
What have they asked you to do?

19:38.302 --> 19:40.304
Nothing yet.
I'm trying to get ahead of it.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.932
Listen, there is no way they have proof.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.976
There is no proof for them to have.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.813
So just don't let them play you,
all right?

19:50.939 --> 19:52.107
We'll figure this out.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.778
Look, I don't have to tell you guys

19:56.862 --> 19:59.990
that you set an example
for how boys at this school behave.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.702
-I don't have to tell you--
-So don't tell us.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.329
-[guys laugh]
-Dude, come on.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.455
Show some respect.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.708
What? She said she couldn't tell us
anything we don't already know.

20:09.791 --> 20:13.337
Well, considering you don't know shit,
Luke, you might wanna rethink that.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.546
[jeering, laughter]

20:14.630 --> 20:15.672
Come on.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.257
[wolf-whistling]

20:17.341 --> 20:21.595
Guys! Everybody just shut the hell up,
and listen to the lady.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.515
What I  can  tell you is this.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.894
Courage on the field doesn't mean shit

20:29.353 --> 20:31.647
unless you have the courage
to stand up to each other

20:31.730 --> 20:33.398
when you're being fucking dicks.

20:34.274 --> 20:37.903
Or when you're bragging about that
hot chick you were banging last night.

20:38.362 --> 20:43.867
Or calling us "lady"
like you're a gentleman, but really,

20:43.951 --> 20:45.869
you're just trying to diminish us.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.250
Standing up to that kind of bullshit,

20:53.585 --> 20:55.254
that's what it means to be a man.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.513
Of course I'm taking her to the dance.
She fucking wants it.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.139
Luke, buddy. Come on.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.350
I mean, she consents to wanting it.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.023
You... That was...

21:17.734 --> 21:20.445
You're awesome, as usual.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.532
I mean, at this. I...

21:25.284 --> 21:27.035
I mean, you're good at this.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.330
How are you?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.251
Are you going to that stupid dance?

21:34.501 --> 21:38.171
No, I don't think
it'll be a good scene for me right now.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.217
Are you going?

21:43.635 --> 21:45.220
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely going.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.598
-Charlie!
-What?

21:48.682 --> 21:50.767
Me and Charlie are going to the dance.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.103
We... uh... what?

21:53.186 --> 21:55.230
Yeah, we talked about it, remember?

21:55.314 --> 21:56.815
No, but...

21:59.943 --> 22:01.153
OK, uh, yeah.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.447
-Great.
-Great.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.160
Shit, Justin, I didn't mean to...

22:08.785 --> 22:10.120
I can tell her I can't go.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.998
I'm just, like, really afraid of her.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.833
Dude, it's fine. [chuckles]

22:15.375 --> 22:16.335
You should go.

22:16.793 --> 22:19.588
Are you sure?
I was sort of hoping you'd tell me not to.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.133
Good luck, man.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.973
[Justin] I just thought...

22:31.058 --> 22:34.853
that if you reached out to him,
he might actually listen.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.647
I'll see what I can do.

22:38.231 --> 22:39.399
Hey, good looking out.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.946
It's been a hard season for everybody.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.240
How you been doing lately?

22:49.743 --> 22:51.286
Yeah, I'm, um, I'm all right.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.579
Yeah?

22:54.331 --> 22:55.832
You've been going to meetings?

22:58.710 --> 23:04.132
Yeah, I was going to this one
at this church, by the Jensens' house.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.384
Uh...

23:06.343 --> 23:08.136
It was full of old guys.

23:08.678 --> 23:12.432
They didn't really think a high school kid
had much to complain about, so...

23:12.516 --> 23:15.477
There's a church near my house
that does meetings, I think.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.396
East County Baptist.

23:17.854 --> 23:21.400
I always see guys hanging out
in the parking lot afterwards, you know?

23:21.483 --> 23:24.236
Seems like a younger crowd.
Might be worth checking out.

23:27.781 --> 23:31.410
[distorted voice]  School's over,
but our game's not. Don't tell Tony.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.744
[dial tone beeps]

23:33.161 --> 23:35.789
Clay, where the fuck have you been, man?

23:36.373 --> 23:39.251
Look, I'm sorry, man.
I got, er, held up. I, um...

23:39.334 --> 23:41.753
-Did you find Tyler?
-He's still not here.

23:41.837 --> 23:45.215
His mom said his shift started at 3:30.
It's now after five.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.926
So he lied to her?

23:48.009 --> 23:49.761
He's been lying to all of us, man.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.473
Standall knows something, I swear to God.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.725
Why would Tyler be talking to Bolan?

23:57.978 --> 23:58.979
Clay!

23:59.396 --> 24:00.230
Sorry.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.983
What is up with you?
We have a problem here.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.153
I think we might have a few problems.
Oh, shit.

24:07.070 --> 24:11.283
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
My mom said you guys called the house.

24:12.492 --> 24:15.328
Yeah, well, we called you first,
and you didn't answer.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.289
OK, well, my phone was off.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.750
Where've you been since after school?
Are you late for work?

24:21.251 --> 24:23.962
No, my shift's not even till 5:30.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.590
What do you care?
What's the big emergency?

24:28.633 --> 24:34.014
I just needed to ask you if you would
help me DJ the dance tomorrow night.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.891
Why would I help you DJ the dance?

24:36.516 --> 24:39.436
Dude, you helped me
set it all up on my computer. I don't--

24:39.519 --> 24:40.812
OK, well, I can't.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.190
-Sorry.
-Why not?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.233
I need to get to work now.

24:50.197 --> 24:54.117
Where I'll be for the next five hours,
just in case you guys are keeping track.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.083
[Tony sighs]

25:04.377 --> 25:05.795
[R&B music plays]

25:13.386 --> 25:14.346
[Winston] OK.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.473
If I had known you were so good
at this stupid game,

25:16.556 --> 25:18.308
I never would have agreed to it.

25:18.391 --> 25:21.019
Yeah, you know,
it's kinda like a lower-class sport.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.479
I think that's the problem.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.982
You wasted all your time
at Hillcrest learning, what, polo?

25:26.399 --> 25:27.400
And cricket!

25:28.109 --> 25:29.027
[grunts]

25:32.572 --> 25:33.573
[Winston sighs]

25:33.949 --> 25:37.160
After being there, I guess
Liberty must seem pretty boring, huh?

25:38.119 --> 25:39.496
The opposite, actually.

25:40.539 --> 25:45.835
I mean, I never saw anyone melt down
over a phone ringing at Hillcrest.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.216
[Alex] Yeah, that was, um...

25:51.299 --> 25:53.385
It was definitely not boring.
I'll give you that.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.595
You're pretty close to them, right?

25:56.263 --> 25:58.640
Clay, I mean, what was that about?

25:59.432 --> 26:00.433
Oh, that...

26:01.059 --> 26:02.477
It's just Clay being Clay.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.605
He can be pretty intense sometimes.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.609
[ball rolls down lane]

26:12.028 --> 26:13.154
[Winston] Ha! Come on.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.073
All right, guess I'm buying dinner.

26:16.950 --> 26:17.826
Yeah, OK.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.997
So, I was thinking, um...

26:22.581 --> 26:23.748
about the dance.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.543
You know, since you're gonna be there
already anyway,

26:26.626 --> 26:30.422
I thought maybe, I don't know,
like, I could keep you company?

26:32.257 --> 26:35.135
I don't know. We could make fun
of all the people dancing.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.012
Sure.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.180
Yeah, we could hang out.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.432
OK.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.392
I mean, just 'cause
the whole thing is bullshit

26:42.475 --> 26:44.603
doesn't mean
that we shouldn't still go, right?

26:44.686 --> 26:47.314
Like for social commentary purposes?

26:48.106 --> 26:50.567
Uh... I guess, as friends?

26:51.568 --> 26:52.485
Absolutely.

26:53.486 --> 26:54.404
Friends.

26:57.115 --> 26:57.991
Cool.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.160
Cool.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.330
Cool.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.211
[Alex gasps] I'm sorry.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.755
I'm not.

27:13.256 --> 27:15.175
I've been waiting for you
to do that all night.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.527
-[guard] All right, let's go.
-[scanner whirs]

[cell phone vibrates]

27:38.740 --> 27:40.116
You still getting those calls?

27:41.409 --> 27:43.828
Uh... No, this is just... This is Ani.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.664
Look, I, um, I gotta take this.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.666
I'll catch up with you later.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.835
[tense music plays]

27:52.587 --> 27:54.047
What? What do you want?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.716
[distorted voice]
You tell Justin Foley about me?

28:01.388 --> 28:02.764
No. How do you know Justin?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.308
You tell your girlfriend?

28:06.768 --> 28:08.228
[distorted laughter]

28:08.728 --> 28:09.646
You did.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.272
So what?

28:12.357 --> 28:14.067
She's your alibi, right?

28:14.609 --> 28:17.320
She says she was with you
the night Bryce was killed?

28:17.404 --> 28:18.238
Yes.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.617
But she wasn't, and we can prove it.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.455
Look, I can't fucking do this.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.791
OK? Just tell me what you have, or...

28:30.125 --> 28:32.127
There's no way you...

28:32.711 --> 28:33.962
I didn't kill Bryce.

28:34.462 --> 28:37.215
I didn't, OK?
So just tell me what you have, or...

28:37.882 --> 28:41.302
Or fucking do whatever you want.
All right? Just do whatever.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.263
You know what?

28:43.346 --> 28:44.472
Maybe you're right.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.891
Maybe you have been through enough.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.645
Look, if you want Monty's phone
and everything on it, you can have it.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.272
All right? It's yours.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.065
[suspenseful music plays]

28:57.777 --> 28:59.404
All you have to do is go get it.

29:03.366 --> 29:04.367
Where is it?

29:06.703 --> 29:08.246
It's in the place on campus

29:08.329 --> 29:10.665
where girls go talk shit
about guys like Monty

29:10.749 --> 29:12.041
just to get attention.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.003
[dial tone beeps]

29:22.927 --> 29:23.970
[sighs]

29:28.767 --> 29:30.852
[phone rings]

29:47.118 --> 29:48.244
[breathing heavily]

29:49.370 --> 29:51.581
[distorted voice]  Clay, Clay, Clay.

29:52.457 --> 29:56.252
You didn't really think I'd give you
Monty's phone after all of that, did you?

29:56.336 --> 29:57.712
What the fuck do you want?

29:58.129 --> 30:01.299
Don't tell anyone anything.
I'm your little secret.

30:02.133 --> 30:02.967
Why?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.303
Because we're not done yet.

30:05.386 --> 30:06.387
When are we done?

30:07.138 --> 30:08.389
At the dance tonight.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.893
Answer when we call,
and you'll get Monty's phone.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.481
Why the dance?
What happens at the fucking dance?

30:17.440 --> 30:21.027
Because everyone likes to dance, Clay.
See you there.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.487
-[dial tone beeps]
-You--

30:25.490 --> 30:26.616
Goddamnit!

30:28.952 --> 30:31.120
If you don't wanna go, why are you going?

30:34.207 --> 30:36.334
Because my girlfriend wants to go.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.504
[Ellman]
But you don't love your girlfriend.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.301
Still not sure I believe in love.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.304
Have you ever been in love?

30:49.305 --> 30:50.139
No.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.641
That's my point.

30:51.724 --> 30:53.142
What about Hannah?

30:56.604 --> 30:59.649
Yeah, for a long time,
I thought I was in love with her.

31:01.818 --> 31:03.820
OK, so what's the difference

31:03.903 --> 31:07.240
between thinking you're in love
and actually being in love?

31:09.158 --> 31:11.578
I didn't know who she was.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.292
I didn't know what love was.
I still don't.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.711
[Ellman] You don't know what love is,

31:19.794 --> 31:23.923
but you're confident you can say
that it's a lie.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.718
OK, maybe not a lie. Maybe a...

31:28.553 --> 31:30.555
[sighs] Like a fantasy?

31:32.015 --> 31:33.808
When you see people
for who they really are,

31:33.892 --> 31:36.603
the fantasy goes away,
and then so does the love.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.855
So love is just some ideal.

31:40.231 --> 31:44.068
Which means that
no one can ever truly love anyone else,

31:44.152 --> 31:46.279
and no one can ever truly love you.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.158
So do you think I'm just avoiding?

31:51.242 --> 31:54.245
And no fair saying,
"It doesn't matter what I think,"

31:54.329 --> 31:57.290
because I'm tired of that tactic,
and it does matter to me...

31:58.291 --> 31:59.292
what you think.

32:00.543 --> 32:01.544
I think...

32:02.754 --> 32:03.796
I wonder...

32:05.924 --> 32:08.134
if you do believe in love,

32:08.217 --> 32:11.888
but then you love so fiercely
that it hurts sometimes.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.975
And you're afraid of that hurt,

32:17.268 --> 32:18.478
as anyone would be.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.106
[gentle instrumental music plays]

32:25.234 --> 32:26.527
If you love someone,

32:28.488 --> 32:29.906
you're going to lose them.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.201
Sometime, somehow.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.371
Yes, quite possibly. [sighs]

32:38.873 --> 32:41.668
But we... love anyway.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.128
Don't we?

32:46.798 --> 32:47.632
OK.

32:49.175 --> 32:51.219
So what exactly do you believe in?

32:52.387 --> 32:56.683
[Clay]  I believe we're all alone,
and that no one can save us but ourselves.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.686

Look at you so dapper in your suit.

- What do you want, Mom?

33:03.314 --> 33:05.650
Well, I was cleaning out the basement,

33:06.609 --> 33:07.860
look what I found.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.947
Mr. Poopers! [chuckles]

33:11.531 --> 33:13.616
You used to take him everywhere
when you were little.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.494
He always cheered you up,
so I thought that...

33:17.328 --> 33:19.038
Mom, I'm not five anymore.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.124
You're never too old for a little comfort.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.460
Yeah, isn't that covered in, like,
old drool and snot?

33:24.544 --> 33:27.505
OK, I'll put him in
with the stuff for Goodwill.

33:28.923 --> 33:29.924
Wait, Mom, um...

33:30.425 --> 33:32.593
I'll keep him, whatever.

33:38.766 --> 33:44.063
So did you get a Valentine's Day card
for Ani at the mall yesterday,

33:44.147 --> 33:47.108
or do you kids
not get each other cards anymore?

33:47.191 --> 33:48.192
No, we don't.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.363
How did you know I was at the mall?

33:52.655 --> 33:55.366
Oh, I thought you mentioned it.
Or maybe Justin said something.

33:55.950 --> 33:59.245
Anyway... say hi to Ani for me,

33:59.787 --> 34:03.416
and, um... have fun tonight, OK?

34:06.294 --> 34:08.254
[Clay] We're gonna have fun,
it's your first dance.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.213
OK.

34:09.797 --> 34:10.965
My first dance.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.926
And those calls?

34:15.344 --> 34:17.930
Yeah, no. They stopped, so...

34:18.014 --> 34:19.515
So we can enjoy the dance?

34:19.974 --> 34:21.184
Yes, we can.

["Batgirl (Edit)"

No.

You're amusing. Permission denied.

Hey, I stood up for you at that workshop.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.270
That should get me one dance.

I don't need you to stand up for me.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.984
I know, of course you don't. I just...

35:13.236 --> 35:16.030
Look, I think the shit you do
is really good,

35:16.447 --> 35:18.282
and even when
you go batshit crazy on people,

35:18.366 --> 35:20.409
I get what you're doing, and it's right.

35:21.536 --> 35:24.330
I just happen to think
you look mad sexy when you do it.

35:24.872 --> 35:25.873

Yes, it's absolutely wrong.

Well, only to get back at Justin.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.466
Right?

35:36.217 --> 35:37.969
But you chose the wrong guy, you know.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.098
Charlie's, like, gay or bi or something.

35:42.181 --> 35:44.475
Well, of course you'd think that.

35:44.892 --> 35:48.479
Just because he's the only guy
on your team that's decent and kind

35:48.563 --> 35:50.773
and doesn't hate women,
you guys think he's gay?

35:51.399 --> 35:52.525
That's fucked up.

35:52.608 --> 35:53.776
No, it's not like that.

35:54.193 --> 35:55.111
Charlie's our guy.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.404
He's our quarterback.

35:58.447 --> 36:01.325
I mean, maybe assuming

36:01.409 --> 36:04.078
that calling someone gay
is automatically an insult...

36:05.329 --> 36:06.998
maybe that's the fucked-up thing.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.293
Maybe you're not as woke as you think.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.715
Well, if I need to get more woke,

36:16.966 --> 36:18.968
I'll make sure to come to you next time.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.220

You made it.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.133
You can assign the faders to hot keys,

it's been really busy, it's stressful.
