Thanks.

["Saturday Night" by Schoolly D plays]

01:06.640 --> 01:07.600
Daniel?

01:08.920 --> 01:10.040
We've got company.

01:10.760 --> 01:11.600
Shit!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.480
Hello.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.520
Are you the organizer?

01:19.600 --> 01:21.080
Yes. Well, we're a co-op, so…

01:21.160 --> 01:22.280
What is all this?

01:22.360 --> 01:24.760
-Aware what you're doing is illegal?
-Things are going smoothly.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.120
We're not hurting anybody.
Look at all these people. It's fine.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.480
We've got music, painting,

01:30.560 --> 01:34.440
and dancing. You see?
It's peaceful. It's no-violent.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.600
I gotta tell ya,
I'm not a fan of this music. Okay?

01:38.600 --> 01:41.400
Apparently, you're not bugging anyone.
Except the junkies.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.160
But watch out.
If someone makes a complaint,

01:44.240 --> 01:46.520
I'm shutting you down. Is that clear?

01:47.520 --> 01:50.280
-Yes. Have a good day.
-Wait. Do you have any merguez?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.320
-Any?
-Sausages. Sandwiches.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.240
We don't.

01:53.840 --> 01:54.840
Have a good day.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.440
I'm watching you.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.520
Know that drum solo
between the two halves of the song?

02:30.600 --> 02:32.960
The breakbeat?
That part lasts like five seconds.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.600
It's really short. So, that means
the guy just needs to make it loop

02:36.680 --> 02:39.200
by using two copies of the record
on separate turntables.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.280
It's an octopus who's mixing.
It's got glasses.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.160
-Why's the octopus have glasses on?
-Could you put it down, please?

02:45.240 --> 02:47.640
Then, what you could do,
and this is cool,

02:47.720 --> 02:49.160
you can use another tracks break

02:49.240 --> 02:51.280
to make it last longer
or make another rhythm.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.160
You could take a jazz break
and mix it with a funk one.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.560
You see? There are no rules.
You could do what you want.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.920
So, basically,
you start it, you let it go,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.640
you rewind it, let it go,
rewind it, let it go again.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.600
And that's how you make a new loop.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.120
-Do you get it?
-I got it.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.600
What Bambaataa did,

03:06.680 --> 03:08.640
basically,
he uses electro stuff to make loops,

03:08.720 --> 03:10.680
sucky German stuff like Kraftwork.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.880
-Kraftwerk.
-How much is this?

03:12.960 --> 03:16.200
-47 francs. Do you have enough?
-No.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.280
So now, we've a basic way
to create new rhythms.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.920
But what's crazy,
is that with that technique,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.960
these guys are starting
to create entirely new songs with it.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.680
They're basically stealing songs.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.400
Let's see! What you get?

03:30.920 --> 03:32.760
-[car horn toots]
-Whoa! Alright!

03:33.320 --> 03:35.040
Relax, man!

03:36.360 --> 03:38.200
Hey, you guys, what you get?

03:38.280 --> 03:39.840
Lemme see. Give it.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.400
Oh, wow! Ah, yeah!

03:43.240 --> 03:44.840
-Nice!
-And there's a party.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.040
Over at La Chapelle.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.080
-Hi.
-Hey.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.680
-Hi.
-[Béatrice] Hi. It's 2 francs.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.800
-What?
-It's 2 francs to get in.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.360
Since when do we pay to get in?

03:58.440 --> 04:01.760
Since it costs us money to pay
for the flyers and the sound set up…

04:01.840 --> 04:03.920
-But this says--
-Bando, hand over the 2 francs.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.680
Shit, guys! 2 francs, seriously?

04:08.240 --> 04:09.480
-Here.
-Thanks.

Hey, Colt?

04:27.360 --> 04:29.200
Who's that guy wrapping in French?

04:29.280 --> 04:33.200
That's DMB. He's some old rocker
and he's been hanging out with Dee Nasty.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.000
They say he was part of a gang.
Be careful not to piss him off.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.200
[Colt] Men, picture this.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.080
It's 3 a.m. and we're in the Metro,
the whole platform is empty.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.640
We've just worked out asses off
to get through the sewers,

04:46.720 --> 04:47.920
so we're graphing, you know?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.720
We're chilling, we're smoking,

04:49.800 --> 04:52.840
and then,
two fucking security guards from the RTP

04:52.920 --> 04:55.880
come over to us with this huge dog.
And this dog was enormous…

04:55.960 --> 04:56.960
It was enormous.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.680
Then, they get closer,
holding these huge flashlights,

04:59.760 --> 05:02.040
but shining them right on us
so we couldn't run away.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.880
And I look over to stupid Yazid,
who's still graphing calmly, oblivious.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.760
I go over to them, super calm.
I say, "Good evening, gentlemen."

05:08.840 --> 05:11.440
"Operation Junior, RATP,
what can I do for you?"

05:11.520 --> 05:13.840
"Mr. Blanchard did tell you?"

05:13.920 --> 05:16.440
-Hey, wait, who's Mr. Blanchard?
-"Mr. Blanchard?"

05:16.520 --> 05:18.560
"He's the artistic director of the RATP."

05:18.640 --> 05:21.840
"He created their logo.
A little culture, boys, please."

05:21.920 --> 05:25.040
I say, "We're hear to redecorate.
Clearly, no one's gotten the memo."

05:25.120 --> 05:27.840
"Because we can't work
under these conditions. Understand?"

05:27.920 --> 05:30.640
"This is very irritating."
I say it just like that.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.360
They're looking at each other
and don't know what to do.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.520
So I say, "Yesterday at Barbès,
the same thing."

05:35.600 --> 05:37.880
"There we were, minding our business,
trying to do our jobs,

05:37.960 --> 05:40.720
and I'm very sorry, nothing against you,
but it needs to be said."

05:40.800 --> 05:44.000
"Weren't able to finish our work
thanks to your giant security dog."

05:45.000 --> 05:47.560
I got mad, just like that,
and then, they apologized.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.200
And they shook my hand,

05:49.280 --> 05:52.120
"We're so sorry to have bothered you
and we love what you've done."

05:52.200 --> 05:55.520
-"It's beautiful."
-Oh, that's the bomb, home man.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.880
Didier would've loved that.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.000
-Would've lost his mind.
-That's true.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.880
Where is he, Bruno? Is he still in Italy?

06:00.960 --> 06:04.160
-Italy, then Spain, his new girlfriends…
-You haven't heard from him?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.400
-Why would I?
-Thought he was your friend?

06:06.480 --> 06:08.720
He's your friend too,
have you heard from him?

06:09.440 --> 06:12.440
He's been gone for six months
and he doesn't give a fuck.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.160
And I don't give a fuck about him either.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.840
He's losing it or what?

06:28.640 --> 06:30.040
Sir?

06:30.560 --> 06:32.840
Sir? This is the last stop.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.400
All we did for a whole year was shows,

08:46.480 --> 08:49.640
we danced on television shows,
I gave classes.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.440
And man, the hot chicks I banged,

08:51.520 --> 08:54.960
the girls were unreal! Holy shit!
Not even gonna describe them to you

08:55.040 --> 08:57.000
-'cause your jaws will drop.
-A year? Sure?

08:57.600 --> 09:00.520
-Wasn't it more like six months?
-Since when're you keeping tabs?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.040
Even by my count, still six months.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.960
Who cares how long?
I'm here now, aren't I?

09:05.000 --> 09:05.920

we'll show them how it's done.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.960
It's my treat. You coming or not?

09:30.040 --> 09:32.440
We're going tagging. Down at the docks.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.440

-What crew?
-With the taggers.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.920

Ah… alright. I'm in. We'll have some fun.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.400
Since you're here, I should ask,
it's a bit hard to get a hold of you,

09:52.480 --> 09:53.720
where's the ghetto blaster?

09:53.800 --> 09:57.080
Ah, shit! Is that what
the face you're giving me is about?

09:57.600 --> 10:01.000
It's fine. I'll give it back to you.
I'll pay you back for it. I'm flush now.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.200
Not talking about money.
Talking about respect, Didier, really.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.680
Don't care about the ghetto blaster.
You come and go,

10:07.760 --> 10:09.240
and then, oh, you're at the window.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.800
Is that what this is?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.760
Think you can treat us like your groupies?

10:15.760 --> 10:18.160
Good one, Bruno!
Shit, I almost fell for it.

they don't have baguettes in Italy.

Of course, they have them.

-Yeah?

12:57.800 --> 13:00.280
Tomorrow morning,
I've got Math homework due at eight.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.320
Still pass your finals,
no matter what you do.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.480
What're you guys talking about?
Who cares about finals?

13:04.560 --> 13:07.120
There's only one thing to do here,
just like this. And then…

13:08.800 --> 13:10.880
-I'm coming… Oh, Yazid!
-[Yazid laughing]

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
Come on, tag.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.120
We're screwed no matter what.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.240
In six months,
it's gonna be the army or factory.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.720
Swear, never joining the army.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.920
You're not enlisting?
Then tell me what your plan is.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.000
-I got a plan.
-What's that?

13:24.080 --> 13:25.000
I'll play crazy.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.680
Oh, yeah?

13:26.760 --> 13:29.080
I'm serious. I know a guy in Montjoie,

13:29.160 --> 13:31.280
you know, Jean-Claude?

13:31.360 --> 13:34.040
And he's got some banging pills,
really good stuff.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.520
Really works.
Let you go if you play dumb.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.520
Fucking police are here.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.200
-What do we do?
-Let me handle it.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.360
Let me handle it. Evening.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.320
What're you kids doing here?

13:45.400 --> 13:47.080
Paris City Hall Juniors.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.800
Operation "quads gone wild".

13:48.880 --> 13:50.560
-Here's my card.
-"Quads gone wild"?

13:50.640 --> 13:52.600
-What is that?
-What, you don't know?

13:52.680 --> 13:55.240
It's the most popular cultural project
in all of Paris.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.520
It's in the papers.
You haven't heard of it?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.120
-Have you heard of that?
-Never.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.320
-Mr. Blanchard didn't tell you?
-Who's that?

14:01.400 --> 14:04.360
He's the cultural advisor
to Mr. Chirac. He's…

14:06.080 --> 14:08.720
We're basically bringing new life
to old stones by adding color.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.360
So that in a year or two,
we'll cover all docks around the Seine.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.840
We'll verify that. On the wall.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.920
I'm very sorry, but we've been working
just day and night like animals…

14:17.000 --> 14:19.440
-Said I'd verify that. On the wall!
-Let's verify it.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.600
I said on the wall.
Back upl!

14:21.680 --> 14:24.560
-He's not gonna be happy.
-Got a bunch of graffiti guys vandalizing.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.400
We're gonna need backup and a vehicle.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.640
-Excuze me?
-Yes, sir?

14:27.720 --> 14:30.400
-Is that Mr. Blanchard on the line?
-Hey you, don't move!

14:30.480 --> 14:31.520
Are there any minors?

14:31.600 --> 14:33.760
-By profession?
-Any minors?

14:34.920 --> 14:36.320
-No more jokes.
-[boys] Sorry.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.480
Are there any minors?

14:37.560 --> 14:40.000
-Alright, let's see some ID. Now!
-Sure.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.960
Mind if I get my wallet out of my bag?

14:42.040 --> 14:42.920
Go ahead.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.880
Guys? Go for plan 2.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.080
-[Colt] Go, go, go!
-[laughter]

14:53.160 --> 14:55.600
-Come on, run!
-Come one, go!

14:55.680 --> 14:58.360
Run, run, run, run, run!

14:58.440 --> 14:59.600
Hurry, hurry!

15:31.200 --> 15:32.080
My money.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.920
What are you doing in my room?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.800
-Get out.
-Where's my money?

15:37.960 --> 15:40.240
Told you
I don't want dirty money in my house.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.240
-Now, get out before--
-That's my fucking money!

15:42.320 --> 15:44.000
I busted my ass making it!

15:44.080 --> 15:45.040
Oh, yeah?

15:46.240 --> 15:49.080
How'd you make it?

15:59.480 --> 16:02.360
Go to the kitchen.
There's a paper for you to sign.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.000
What is this?

16:15.760 --> 16:17.680
Shit, military service?

16:19.200 --> 16:22.520
I told you I'm not fucking going.
I'll make sure I'm discharged.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.720
And you can't make me!

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
-Hey.
-Hey, wassup, how you doing?

16:41.080 --> 16:42.000
Good. How are you?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.120
Didier!

16:58.600 --> 17:00.120
How was the holiday?

17:00.200 --> 17:01.760
I worked non stop.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.280
Just because it was Italy,
doesn't mean it was a vacation.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.000
You're so tense.

17:08.840 --> 17:11.040
Let's celebrate.
Let's celebrate your return.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.040
With what?

17:19.560 --> 17:20.720
What's next for you?

17:20.800 --> 17:22.840
I've gotta get out of my dad's house.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.640
-Can probably find you a place. Mmm.
-Oh, yeah?

17:26.280 --> 17:27.320
-Where?
-At 34.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.560
Building 7.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.280
Know a guy in social housing.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.840
No.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.560
No, I've really gotta get out of here.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.600
Suit yourself.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.120
What are they selling?

17:41.200 --> 17:42.120
Hash.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.240
-That too?
-No.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.320
And coke?

17:52.200 --> 17:53.040
Too pricey.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.840
It's for rich white people in fashion,
and music and banking.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.160
The herion's just for us.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.200
It's just for us, Didier.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.080
Kills too many people around here.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.120
So, what's your project now?

18:10.640 --> 18:11.640
My project?

18:13.280 --> 18:15.520
To conquer Paris, my friend.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.040
That's my project.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.680
Ah, Didier the conquerer.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.240
-[Colt] Oh, wow! [laughs]
-[whistle]

18:41.320 --> 18:42.880
What is this? It's like a castle.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.160
That's the car De Gaulle has.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.480
That's where you live?

18:59.120 --> 19:00.000
No.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.160
-What is all this?
-Whoa.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.480
-This room is unreal.
-No way.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.400
Your parents let you do this to the walls?

19:06.480 --> 19:08.080
Parents don't give a shit.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.720
-So, what you guys steal?
-I managed to grab this.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.360
Pretty good haul.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.120
-Who grabbed pink?
-Me.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.480
-That's fine, it's good.
-I've got some green and blue.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.200
Well played, boys. You want a soda?

19:22.280 --> 19:24.600
-Yeah.
-Move over, they're in here.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.200

19:26.280 --> 19:28.000
-No way.
-Of course, come on.

19:28.680 --> 19:29.600
"Of course."

19:29.680 --> 19:31.040
-Cheers, Yazid.
-Glass bottles.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.240
It's disgusting in the cans.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.760
-Here.
-There's something I don't get.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.080
Every time we've stolen spray paint,
you could've bought the isle.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.760
It's about principles.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.800

he lifts them.

Look. Don't you recognize him?

19:52.960 --> 19:54.800
Mom, stop. You're being such a pain.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.600
-Leave us alone, please.
-It's no way to speak to me.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.680
-Naughty boy!
-Yeah, you're right.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.120

you can't talk to your mom like that.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.200
-Tigrou.

-Because they've a girl in their crew.

-[woman] Hello?
-Hello. These're for Mr. Colonna.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.840
-I'll bring them up.
-I'm supposed to give them to him.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.440
-He's busy shooting, we can't bother him.
-Okay.

25:33.200 --> 25:37.000
And do you have anything for me?
So I have something to bring back?

25:37.760 --> 25:40.600
Hang on. I'll see if there's anything.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.840
Excuse me,
but may I have a puff of your joint there?

26:13.920 --> 26:15.400
Wow, that's amazing.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.480
Sound like you're asking for the time.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.080
Here, enjoy.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.680
Some good shit.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.840
Of course it's good. Have other stuff too.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.280
Oh, yeah? Like what?

26:34.360 --> 26:35.960
Coke… whatever you want.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.920
I can get it delivered to you here.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.920
-No worries.
-Oh, yeah?

26:41.280 --> 26:42.120
Look at them.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.240
They like showing off.
They're not like that where I'm from.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.760
Ah, no, no. They're goddesses, for real.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.720
But no one ever takes their pictures.

26:49.800 --> 26:50.800
Where are you from?

26:51.640 --> 26:52.760
Saint-Denis.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.080
Tell me, uh…

26:56.000 --> 26:59.040
One of the male models just stood me up.
Wanna do a test shoot?

26:59.920 --> 27:00.760
A what?

27:00.840 --> 27:02.200
A tryout for some photos.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.400
Would you like to?

27:03.480 --> 27:05.080
-Photos?
-Sylvain?

27:05.160 --> 27:07.080
-Yeah? Okay, thanks.
-Everything is ready.

27:08.680 --> 27:09.520
You coming?

27:36.440 --> 27:39.000
[record scratching]

27:42.320 --> 27:43.480
You got dope equipment.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.400
Is that the SL1200?

27:45.960 --> 27:47.200
You make music too?

27:47.280 --> 27:49.040
Not yes, but I'd love to, yeah.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.280
Why's that coin there?

27:51.360 --> 27:56.000
Oh, that? It adds weight to the arm.
So it doesn't skip when you're scratching.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.520
You using special cartridges?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.680
-Yeah, they're Shures. SC35, you know 'em?
-Yeah.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.280
Checked them out,
even secondhand they're a fortune.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.240
It took me three years to pay for mine.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.680
And bringing all my gear outside,
it gets dusty…

28:12.400 --> 28:13.280
Philippe?

28:13.880 --> 28:15.880
-How's it going?
-Great, how're you?

28:15.960 --> 28:18.000
Super, I'm great. Here, this is No-Bru.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.120
-Franck?
-Yo?

28:19.200 --> 28:20.680
-Te-Col too.
-Cool.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.520
-Demo. This guy's a real graffiti king.
-Nice to meet you.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.760
We're going to New York City
this summer. You want in?

28:25.840 --> 28:28.080
Me? How am I supposed to get to New York?

28:28.160 --> 28:29.000
You're crazy.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.400
Parents own an apartment there.
You can crash.

28:31.480 --> 28:34.400
-Yeah? I'll think about it, Bando. Thanks.
-Sure.

28:36.160 --> 28:40.160
-So, where's your spot?
-My spot? It's the one over there.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.160
Ah, nice. Check it out, Bando,
we've got some competition.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.680
We paint together,
there's no competition.

28:58.840 --> 28:59.880
[Bruno] Hey!

29:00.920 --> 29:02.280
Do you guys know Lady V?

29:03.480 --> 29:04.560
Yeah, we might, yeah.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.320
I'm Shen.
Tell her I'm looking for her, please.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.400
For what?

29:09.480 --> 29:10.880
No reason. Say I'm looking for her.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.040
Otherwise?

29:12.120 --> 29:14.400
Otherwise nothing, friend.
Let her know I'm looking, that's it.

29:16.080 --> 29:16.920
Okay.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.760
I'll let her know.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.760
Peace.

29:27.440 --> 29:30.000
Pow! Pow! Pow!

29:30.080 --> 29:32.600
-Mr. "Lopesh"! Good?
-Oh! How're you doing?

29:32.680 --> 29:33.720
All right. All right.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.520
What's with the scribbling?

29:35.600 --> 29:38.800
What's with the spandex?

29:38.880 --> 29:41.080
Hey, this is my girlfriend. Emma.

29:41.600 --> 29:42.440
Hello.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.120
-Nice to meet you.
-My Portuguese pal.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.160
Isn't she gorgeous?

29:48.240 --> 29:51.920
Crashing at hers for free right now.
Looks like she wants to boff me, right?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.440
She's crazy about me.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.400
Jesus!

29:58.520 --> 30:01.960
-Is it her fault we don't see you anymore?
-Not at all! Let me explain.

30:02.480 --> 30:05.040
I've gotten
into some crazy projects in Paris.

30:05.120 --> 30:08.200
I've been modeling,
and I know a bunch of fashion people.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.680
I feel like a star.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.040
A star who sells out?

30:15.120 --> 30:17.200
Yeah, maybe that's true.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.600
-I'm just doing the best I can. Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.800
Don't all have a nice mommy
and a comfy bed.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.160
Sometimes I need to go through
some shit. Mmm?

30:26.320 --> 30:27.320
Unlike some.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.320
So, what's up with you?

30:33.120 --> 30:35.200
Not much.
The summer I'm going to New York.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.240
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, we're gonna paint.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.440
New York!

30:40.280 --> 30:42.440
You gonna travel
in the baggage compartment?

30:49.360 --> 30:51.600
-This has some really good stuff.
-Come on.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.320
Fuck! We only made 100 francs.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.600
Honestly, 100 francs isn't that bad.
We'll get there.

31:20.680 --> 31:21.880
When will we get there?

31:21.960 --> 31:24.080
I mean, last week we had,
what, ten people?

31:24.160 --> 31:27.520
Suddenly today it's 50.
We'll be at a hundred soon.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.280
Come on, Daniel!
Are you high? This is crazy!

31:30.360 --> 31:33.560
We've still got to be able to live,
to eat, to pay the bills!

31:33.640 --> 31:36.800
I mean, we can't even cover the cost
of the generator with this.

31:36.880 --> 31:40.040
Hey! Could you please actually react
when I'm talking to you?

31:40.120 --> 31:43.560
It's mostly word of mouth,
it's natural that it's taking some time.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.720
I mean, if it's about easy money,
I might have a plan.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.480
So, what's the scheme now?

31:53.560 --> 31:55.040
I have this friend…

31:55.640 --> 31:57.600
Well, it's a little bit strange…

31:58.240 --> 32:00.840
She mentioned doing a film shoot,
you know?

32:01.880 --> 32:04.080
No, I don't know what you mean, tell me.

32:04.680 --> 32:08.080
Well, these shoots are a bit special.
You know what I mean…

32:08.600 --> 32:10.920
It's insanely good money. 800 francs.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.200
800 francs per scene.
You know? For 15 minutes.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.640
Apparently, all you need to do is show up.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.440
Is the girl fuckable?

32:18.520 --> 32:21.680
Don't know. In any case,
it's just acting. It's not important.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.920
And there'll be three guys watching us,

32:24.000 --> 32:28.800
so… as soon as it's finished,
I'll grab the money and run.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.040
Okay, you should do it.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.200
-But if you do, I'll do it.
-No, wait, that wasn't what I meant.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.240
But just think. 1,600 is better than 800.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.640
It's probably not the best plan
in the whole world,

32:45.720 --> 32:49.120
I was just saying stuff…
You're right, wasn't a good solution.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.280
Dan, no, I think it's a wonderful plan,
really. We're doing it.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.560
Let me help.

32:54.160 --> 32:55.160
Daniel!

32:55.760 --> 32:56.600
We're doing it.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.880
Hey, Webo! You want in?
We can all do it together.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.080
Nevermind, hey, man.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.000
Hang on, Béatrice, we're coming!

33:14.440 --> 33:16.920
[Bando] <i>You don't have to have respect</i>
<i>for public monuments.</i>

33:17.000 --> 33:19.040
<i>That's ridiculous in priori assumption.</i>

33:19.120 --> 33:21.280
Tags were supposed to go everywhere.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.560
On beautiful walls, on old walls…

33:24.320 --> 33:26.880
on new walls. Who gives a damn, right?

33:27.840 --> 33:30.840
Except maybe on cars,
'cause that's really annoying.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.680
But anything that's public,

33:34.560 --> 33:37.280
should be ours for the taking. Obviously.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.280
Pfff. They're just a bunch of clowns.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.160
Pfff. Alpha Force, clearly.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.280
Abdelkrim's alright.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.320
Poliskill, my God.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.480
Well, that one's not too bad.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.280
Hey, what're you doing, man?

33:57.400 --> 33:59.400
Isn't Lady V
the girl from the documentary?

33:59.480 --> 34:01.760
We're in this neighborhood for her, right?

34:08.240 --> 34:10.280
Oh, we should totally kill that one, man.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.800
Let's go.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.000
[woman groans in pleasure]

35:09.080 --> 35:12.400
You know, we don't have to do this.
W-w-we can leave.

35:15.840 --> 35:19.120
I mean, it's, it's just
that now the people know me better…

35:19.200 --> 35:20.040
Hmm-mm.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.240
…I could still be a bike courier.

35:22.320 --> 35:26.160
And I thought of a great idea.
You could maybe work in a movie theatre.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.480
Wouldn't that be cool?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.360
-Could work the cash register.
-Yeah?

35:34.440 --> 35:36.800
Alright, my little bunnies,
let's go. You're up.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.400
No, look, really. I've got a friend
and she, um, she works at the Brady.

35:40.480 --> 35:44.480
-She knows the boss, and she's--
-Daniel, we're here, so let's just do it!

35:44.560 --> 35:45.680
Come on.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.360
Well, you know what?

35:51.440 --> 35:52.320
I'm doing it.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.960
A public building, Bruno,
do you understand?

36:26.480 --> 36:28.160
Your stupid little graffiti habit!

36:28.240 --> 36:30.520
If they make us pay to have it removed,
what then?

36:30.600 --> 36:33.280
That could ruin us for the next ten years!

36:33.920 --> 36:37.160
Don't care about your new friend,
not my problem. What about us?

36:39.360 --> 36:41.720
When you decided to quit soccer,
I supported you.

36:42.240 --> 36:45.000
Did everything I could,
so you'd get along with your dad.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.320
I'm the one who told him to trust you.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.280
I don't know, are you losing your mind?

36:54.600 --> 36:57.400
I know that you're out all night,
I'm not an idiot, Bruno!

36:58.520 --> 37:00.600
What will you do if you don't graduate?

37:01.720 --> 37:02.960
Be someone's gopher?

37:06.120 --> 37:07.600
You're starting to forget us.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.320
[dramatic music]

37:46.480 --> 37:47.400
What's up?

37:52.560 --> 37:54.840
It's been a while
since i last saw you here.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.600
Do you wanna…

37:58.280 --> 37:59.280
go smoke a bit?

38:10.600 --> 38:13.000
-You dancing with Solo now? Mmm.
-Solo?

38:13.080 --> 38:13.960
No way!

38:14.040 --> 38:15.920
Now he's gone more into rap.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.040
With his buddy Mathias. Son of an actor.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.920
-Those guys really rapping?
-Oh, yeah. And doing it all in French.

38:23.000 --> 38:23.840
Oh, yeah?

38:23.920 --> 38:26.080
They're gonna destroy our hearing.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.000
Won't destroy anything, we won't listen.

38:32.360 --> 38:34.280
Do you wanna hear something funny?

38:34.360 --> 38:37.120
Know how I said I was in fashion
doing modeling and everything?

38:37.200 --> 38:38.200
Yeah.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.440
Well, that's the result of it.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.080
Oof!

38:43.160 --> 38:44.880
Oh, the bastards.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.960
Oh, they're bastards.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.880
They really showed you no mercy.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.480
My dad has that underwear.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.440
Says they're confortable.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.560
-[laughs] It's true.
-Yeah.

38:56.640 --> 38:57.560
So, anyway…

38:58.200 --> 39:00.120
how've you been?

39:00.200 --> 39:01.280
Oh, I'm amazing.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.200
I was busted by the cops…

39:04.840 --> 39:06.440
For a stupid little graffiti stunt.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.680
My dad won't speak to me anymore,

39:09.360 --> 39:10.760
my mom is on my ass.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.000
What about your future,
if you don't graduate?

39:14.080 --> 39:16.320
Gonna be someone's gofer?
Bruno, look at me.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.200
It's like the world's been divided up
into different parts.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.480
But without anyone noticing,
so it still feels like we have freedom.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.520
But they're divided so rich people
and poor people never mix.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.560
Because what do they have to worry about?

39:33.640 --> 39:38.280
Champagne flowing, girls everywhere,
they're making art just to kill time.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.200
They're living the dream.

39:40.840 --> 39:44.920
What do we have?
A crappy parking lot, an old dance mat?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.520
We're basically waiting
for rich people to notice us.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.800
Waiting patiently for these gentlemen

39:52.880 --> 39:55.240
to allow us into their worlds.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.800
To choose us
from the masses of poor people.

39:57.880 --> 40:02.520
"You, there! You beggar! Come with me."

40:02.600 --> 40:04.520
"No, not you. Too ugly."

40:08.040 --> 40:10.280
It's like we're waiting
for them to choose us.

40:11.840 --> 40:15.160
What about our folks? They're afraid
we're gonna struggle the way they did.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.160
The worst part is when they're the ones
getting you into trouble.

That hippie shit falls flat.
Peace and unity?

43:26.160 --> 43:28.960
Gotta leave that stuff behind.
Follow what they're doing in the US.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.720
-All about cash and revenge.
-We need to make a statement.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.200
We gotta be hardcore,

that can get into people's heads.
