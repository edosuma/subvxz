00:00.395 --> 00:02.311
Previously on "Famous In Love.."

00:02.312 --> 00:03.590
I have that screen test
tomorrow morning..

00:03.614 --> 00:06.326
But Rainer is having
a fundraiser tonight..

00:06.350 --> 00:10.230
We could schmooze a little
and find you your funding.

00:10.254 --> 00:12.232
Jordan Wilder, one of our sources said

00:12.256 --> 00:14.434
that you may have gone
by the name Jordan Michaels.

00:14.458 --> 00:16.236
I found the guy
that we've been looking for.

00:16.260 --> 00:18.204
- Our film, it's a...
- Anh-anh-anh..

00:18.228 --> 00:20.273
- Not so fast.
- Uh, no, no, I'm not drinking.

00:20.297 --> 00:21.474
It's called pounder's privilege.

00:21.498 --> 00:23.243
'You pound a shot,
you get the privilege'

00:23.267 --> 00:25.233
of me listening to your pitch.

00:26.537 --> 00:28.248
'What the hell is
Jordan Wilder doing here?'

00:28.272 --> 00:29.449
Donors love movie stars.

00:29.473 --> 00:31.418
And like it or not,
he's all over the tabloids.

00:31.442 --> 00:33.319
Yeah! For screwing my mom!

00:33.343 --> 00:35.288
So you thought you could just
casually rock up here, huh?

00:35.312 --> 00:37.445
- I'm leaving.
- No, I'm leaving!

00:39.283 --> 00:45.465
Paige? I'll take you home.

01:00.237 --> 01:02.549
- 'Cut!'
- 'Moving on..'

01:02.573 --> 01:05.351
Can we do it again?
I can do it better.

01:05.375 --> 01:08.388
That was great, but when we
reverse for your coverage

01:08.412 --> 01:10.457
I just need you to run
a little faster, okay?

01:10.481 --> 01:12.514
- Faster. Okay.
- Alright. Cool.

01:15.319 --> 01:18.465
Oh, hi, Blaine.
Uh, it's so nice to meet you.

01:18.489 --> 01:20.400
I, I wanted to introduce myself
to you...

01:20.424 --> 01:21.601
What number are you?

01:21.625 --> 01:24.237
I-I, I'm-I'm.. I'm sorry, what?

01:24.261 --> 01:26.372
What number on the call sheet are you?

01:26.396 --> 01:30.310
Oh, um, I'm 17, I think.

01:30.334 --> 01:32.434
So, you're dead girl number three.

01:34.538 --> 01:36.237
Yeah.

01:39.276 --> 01:41.387
I'm sorry, are you having
a full conversation

01:41.411 --> 01:42.489
with my boobs, right now?

01:42.513 --> 01:46.226
Yeah, and they speak volumes.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.494
And I don't really
need to know your name.

01:47.518 --> 01:49.517
But I bet it's a pretty one.

Mm..

02:01.851 --> 02:04.730
Paige, you okay?

02:05.989 --> 02:07.533
Mm..

02:08.925 --> 02:11.002
Paige, call your agent.

02:11.026 --> 02:13.806
People get sick all the time.
Just reschedule.

02:13.830 --> 02:15.863
'But it's Scorsese.'

02:16.900 --> 02:20.713
'Joanie just texted me,
he's there. He came.'

02:20.737 --> 02:22.036
Look at me.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.807
Mm..

02:28.678 --> 02:30.945
- Okay. When is it?
- Nine.

02:32.615 --> 02:34.560
That's in an hour.

02:34.584 --> 02:35.895
And it's our last day
shooting "Locked."

02:35.919 --> 02:37.596
What time is our call time again?

02:37.620 --> 02:39.765
Well, not till 4:00.
You'll be okay by then.

02:39.789 --> 02:41.923
Yeah, but not for the screen test.

02:42.959 --> 02:46.661
Oh, God, I really screwed up. Oh..

02:48.631 --> 02:52.945
Maybe not. It's a long shot,
but I have this hangover remedy.

02:52.969 --> 02:54.902
Do-do you have pickle juice?

03:01.578 --> 03:03.522
God, it was so gross.

03:03.546 --> 03:04.824
Hands all over Billy,
it was disgusting.

03:04.848 --> 03:06.659
He was lucky I didn't
beat the crap out of him.

03:06.683 --> 03:09.562
- What a douche.
- Yeah.

03:09.586 --> 03:10.796
Dude, I'm just so stressed out.

03:10.820 --> 03:11.998
I mean, we're gonna shoot today, but

03:12.022 --> 03:14.755
Shane had to bartend
and we have no money.

03:16.026 --> 03:18.926
It's a bust. My chance
to make my future's done.

03:20.897 --> 03:22.630
Drums.

03:23.733 --> 03:24.910
What?

03:24.934 --> 03:28.614
What's that movie? Um, "Whiplash."

03:28.638 --> 03:30.037
That was a short film first.

03:30.907 --> 03:31.984
And it won Oscars.

03:32.008 --> 03:34.787
And all it needed was finishing funds.

03:34.811 --> 03:36.889
Yeah, yeah, you know,
except for one scene.

03:36.913 --> 03:38.557
I think I even have
enough footage to cut

03:38.581 --> 03:39.841
Paige's version into a short.

03:41.785 --> 03:44.830
I-I can't make this
Sundance a sure deadline.

03:44.854 --> 03:48.034
Dude, I had this prof in film school..

03:48.058 --> 03:49.668
He's one of the programmers

03:49.692 --> 03:51.704
for the Tin Creek Film Festival.

03:51.728 --> 03:54.707
I'm still in contact with him.
You can hit him up.

03:54.731 --> 03:55.941
It's right outside of Park City.

03:55.965 --> 03:58.044
Happens at the exact same time, too.

03:58.068 --> 04:00.646
It's really cool,
it's got that early Sundance

04:00.670 --> 04:02.615
Tarantino, Kevin Smith vibe.

04:02.639 --> 04:03.983
Yeah, yeah, uh

04:04.007 --> 04:06.585
"Clerks" premiered there,
I'm pretty sure.

04:06.609 --> 04:08.521
- Tin Creek.
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.545 --> 04:10.723
Yeah, that might work, bro.
Adam, you're a genius.

04:10.747 --> 04:13.893
No, man. The mellow bud is the genius.

04:13.917 --> 04:17.797
Waking and baking, I see.

04:17.821 --> 04:19.798
- There she is.
- Hi, Cass.

04:19.822 --> 04:21.801
First day, how'd it go?

04:21.825 --> 04:25.704
First night,
actually, and I'm exhausted.

04:25.728 --> 04:27.873
And the lead Blaine
is just a total asshole

04:27.897 --> 04:29.842
who won't even learn my name.

04:29.866 --> 04:32.033
He's managed to memorize my boobs.

04:32.836 --> 04:33.946
But it's fine.

04:33.970 --> 04:37.550
Tonight, I die a painful
and dramatic death

04:37.574 --> 04:39.552
and then, I'm almost done.

04:39.576 --> 04:40.708
Sounds awesome.

04:41.945 --> 04:44.990
- You wanna hit?
- No, I don't.

04:45.014 --> 04:47.726
I'm gonna go to bed.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.728
Hey, Cass, I think I'm gonna
submit "Georgia" as a short

04:49.752 --> 04:51.597
for like, Tin Creek
and other festivals.

04:51.621 --> 04:54.633
Oh, that's awesome.
But with Billy or with Paige?

04:54.657 --> 04:55.768
I think Paige.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.670
Either makes no sense. She has a name.

04:57.694 --> 04:58.838
Yeah, I think so.

04:58.862 --> 05:00.639
Plus, she's gonna be so stoked.

05:00.663 --> 05:02.808
So you obviously haven't told her yet.

05:02.832 --> 05:05.878
Oh, no, she's at the, uh,
the, uh, screen test thing.

05:05.902 --> 05:08.647
That was at 9:00. It's almost 12:00.

05:08.671 --> 05:10.616
Which is weird
because she hasn't texted me

05:10.640 --> 05:11.884
to tell me how it went.

05:11.908 --> 05:13.752
What time did you guys leave
last night?

05:13.776 --> 05:16.822
Um... I left with Billy around 2:00

05:16.846 --> 05:18.724
but Paige left before we did.

05:18.748 --> 05:20.960
And she didn't text you
when she got home safely?

05:20.984 --> 05:23.762
No, actually, I haven't heard from her

05:23.786 --> 05:24.930
since she left the party.

05:24.954 --> 05:26.665
Which was when?

05:26.689 --> 05:29.902
- Um, I think, like, 11:00.
- Call her, Jake.

05:29.926 --> 05:31.092
I'm gonna call her.

05:35.632 --> 05:36.709
She's not answering.

05:36.733 --> 05:38.577
Let's go to her place.
I know her gate code.

05:38.601 --> 05:40.646
Okay, I'm driving, 'cause you're high.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.970
Babe, I will.. I'll see you later.

05:44.607 --> 05:46.585
- Peace out, Adam.
- I love you.

05:46.609 --> 05:50.923
'Breathe in, one, two. Exhale out.'

05:50.947 --> 05:54.059
That's it! I can't do this.

05:54.083 --> 05:57.696
There's nothing worse than
sitting still for this long.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.820
- Nina!
- No.

05:59.055 --> 06:00.755
- Nina!
- No.

06:07.797 --> 06:09.675
Nina, Nina.. Hey! No, look..

06:09.699 --> 06:10.976
- Wait up. Wait, wait...
- I..

06:11.000 --> 06:13.834
I'm sorry, Steve, I am. I-I just..

06:14.938 --> 06:16.749
I can't concentrate or..

06:16.773 --> 06:18.817
...or meditate
or whatever you call it.

06:18.841 --> 06:20.920
Oh, it took me years
to learn how to meditate.

06:20.944 --> 06:23.923
I don't expect you to get it
on the first try.

06:23.947 --> 06:26.525
- Don't worry.
- Okay, look..

06:26.549 --> 06:28.716
It's not even that, really.

06:29.719 --> 06:33.666
Today is the last shooting day
for "Locked."

06:33.690 --> 06:36.735
You know, a big and important
day for any producer.

06:36.759 --> 06:40.639
Except me, because Rainer's
banned me from the set.

06:40.663 --> 06:43.842
I can't even be there for
the wrap day of my own movie.

06:43.866 --> 06:45.633
That sucks!

06:45.969 --> 06:47.813
It does.

06:47.837 --> 06:50.849
Do you wanna go get
a smoothie and talk about it?

06:50.873 --> 06:54.041
- Uh, with vodka?
- However you take it.

06:58.681 --> 06:59.925
This is so decadent.

06:59.949 --> 07:03.896
Fluffy robes, room service,
I feel just like "Pretty Woman."

07:03.920 --> 07:06.732
But not the prostitute part.

07:06.756 --> 07:08.656
Absolutely not.

07:12.595 --> 07:13.872
Thank you.

07:13.896 --> 07:15.029
For what?

07:16.633 --> 07:17.932
You made me feel better.

07:18.768 --> 07:20.846
About myself, about everything.

07:23.573 --> 07:24.717
Hold that thought.

07:27.877 --> 07:28.988
- Hello.
- 'Jordan Wilder?'

07:29.012 --> 07:30.789
'It's Robin Lane from "The Post."'

07:30.813 --> 07:32.858
How did you get my number? What
do I.. Why are you calling me?

07:32.882 --> 07:34.960
'Are you any relation
to Brandy Michaels?'

07:34.984 --> 07:36.695
'The woman who served six years'

07:36.719 --> 07:38.886
'for murdering an Aiden McGee?'

07:41.557 --> 07:42.723
What is it?

07:43.893 --> 07:45.059
Nothing.

07:54.904 --> 07:56.737
She didn't even lock it.

08:02.545 --> 08:03.744
Paige?

08:05.682 --> 08:07.626
Hey, it's us. Are you here?

08:07.650 --> 08:08.983
'She's upstairs.'

08:09.852 --> 08:10.985
Hey.

08:11.988 --> 08:13.788
What the hell are you doing here?

08:19.244 --> 08:21.256
- Why are you here? Answer me!
- Calm down.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.092
Just answer the question.
What are you doing here?

08:24.116 --> 08:25.360
It's not what it looks like. Trust me.

08:25.384 --> 08:29.097
Wait.. Wha.. Did you two
leave the party together?

08:29.121 --> 08:31.232
She needed a ride home.
You were nowhere to be found.

08:31.256 --> 08:33.323
- And then what?
- 'Guys..'

08:35.460 --> 08:37.472
Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're okay.

08:37.496 --> 08:39.307
Yeah, we were worried sick.

08:39.331 --> 08:41.376
Not worried enough to realize
she'd passed out

08:41.400 --> 08:43.299
in my courtyard last night?

08:45.103 --> 08:46.381
Well, Paige, looks like
you have a ride to set now

08:46.405 --> 08:47.505
if you need it.

08:49.308 --> 08:50.607
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:54.179 --> 08:56.391
What was he doing here?
Why did he take you home?

08:56.415 --> 08:59.193
He drove me home because I got
so drunk last night

08:59.217 --> 09:01.996
that I was throwing up
the entire morning so much

09:02.020 --> 09:04.098
that I missed my screen test.

09:04.122 --> 09:05.355
I'm sorry.

09:07.292 --> 09:09.359
Oh, I hope it was worth it.

09:11.263 --> 09:13.074
What's that supposed to mean?

09:13.098 --> 09:14.442
Exactly what I just said.

09:14.466 --> 09:17.145
I hope Derek is-is giving you

09:17.169 --> 09:19.047
your finishing funds on your film.

09:19.071 --> 09:20.148
He's not.

09:20.172 --> 09:21.438
He's not?

09:24.042 --> 09:27.288
Great Zeus, all for nothing?

09:27.312 --> 09:31.125
You knew that I had the screen test.

09:31.149 --> 09:32.460
You knew that I didn't wanna be there.

09:32.484 --> 09:35.296
You knew that I...
said I was not drinking

09:35.320 --> 09:39.033
and then you let that D-bag
pressure me into doing shots

09:39.057 --> 09:41.202
and-and now for what?

09:41.226 --> 09:44.105
- Look, Paige, I'm really sorry.
- Are you?

09:44.129 --> 09:47.208
Because from my perspective, you
completely ignored me last night

09:47.232 --> 09:52.180
and then came barging over
here to accuse me of cheating?

09:52.204 --> 09:54.182
Okay, look, maybe I should leave.

09:54.206 --> 09:56.139
No, I should leave.

09:57.075 --> 09:58.274
Can I have the keys?

10:06.551 --> 10:08.363
Are you okay to drive to set?

10:08.387 --> 10:12.100
I don't know,
my stomach's a little iffy.

10:12.124 --> 10:15.436
I'm sure that this is all
just a simple misunderstanding.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.427
And you guys will work through this.

10:19.264 --> 10:22.076
I may have failed to mention
that Sloane didn't talk to me

10:22.100 --> 10:23.478
for nearly her first
two years at Yale.

10:23.502 --> 10:25.213
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

10:25.237 --> 10:28.149
Oh, she was so pissed I
wouldn't let her pursue acting.

10:28.173 --> 10:31.452
So, she stayed away from you,
but did you respect

10:31.476 --> 10:33.388
her boundaries
and stay away from her, too?

10:33.412 --> 10:36.090
No way. Not exactly. Not exactly.

10:36.114 --> 10:37.392
Respecting their boundaries
doesn't mean

10:37.416 --> 10:39.260
you cut them out of your life.

10:39.284 --> 10:41.262
No, I, I went.. I visited her.

10:41.286 --> 10:43.564
But I didn't try to
talk her out of acting.

10:43.588 --> 10:46.334
I let, I let her be her.

10:46.358 --> 10:48.525
Which is why I wanna ask you
this favor.

10:50.362 --> 10:55.109
My studio is locking the rights
to this manuscript

10:55.133 --> 10:57.478
and I think it's got the perfect
first role for Sloane.

10:57.502 --> 10:59.547
It's not the lead, it's the daughter.

10:59.571 --> 11:02.417
But it's got "Best Supporting"
written all over it.

11:02.441 --> 11:06.154
And her reward for keeping her
end of the bargain..

11:06.178 --> 11:08.489
...I wanna get your expert
female opinion.

11:08.513 --> 11:10.380
I would be honored.

11:15.253 --> 11:18.488
No. No, I don't need to fill out
a report, he just arrived.

11:19.357 --> 11:21.157
Okay, thank you.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.560
I called you.

11:24.529 --> 11:26.140
I texted you.

11:26.164 --> 11:29.143
I called every rehab center,
AA meeting, hospital

11:29.167 --> 11:30.567
I even called bars!

11:32.370 --> 11:35.505
Did you sleep with Paige?
I heard that you left with her.

11:39.211 --> 11:41.344
- Who told you that?
- Sloane.

11:45.383 --> 11:47.483
Paige is a friend. She needed me.

11:49.287 --> 11:50.486
Nothing happened.

11:53.158 --> 11:54.469
I'm upset.

11:54.493 --> 11:57.260
I'm upset at the way you acted
at the fundraiser.

11:58.263 --> 12:00.163
It made me look at us
in a whole new light.

12:01.066 --> 12:05.246
And... I'm not sure this is working.

12:05.270 --> 12:07.048
No..

12:07.072 --> 12:10.284
Look, no, I'm-I'm so passionate
about this charity

12:10.308 --> 12:12.286
I got, I got so ambitious

12:12.310 --> 12:15.389
I-I realized that wasn't healthy.

12:15.413 --> 12:18.125
I got so into, I was sucked
into tunnel vision.

12:18.149 --> 12:19.360
I'm sorry. I'm really...

12:19.384 --> 12:23.252
I-I can't talk about this right
now. I, I need to sleep.

12:28.426 --> 12:31.138
Maybe you should go back
to your place.

12:31.162 --> 12:32.362
I need some space.

12:47.512 --> 12:50.558
Alright, well, I guess I'll head out.

12:50.582 --> 12:55.096
Yeah, I'm headed out to my last
scene of "Locked," so..

12:55.120 --> 12:57.398
With a suitcase?

12:57.422 --> 13:00.134
Um, taking the red-eye out tonight.

13:00.158 --> 13:01.135
New York.

13:01.159 --> 13:03.037
"Good Morning America" tomorrow.

13:03.061 --> 13:04.405
Was supposed to talk about my movie

13:04.429 --> 13:06.274
chance at the Oscars..

13:06.298 --> 13:08.878
Of course, all they're gonna ask
about is the affair, probably.

13:09.334 --> 13:11.200
Not my movie.

13:13.071 --> 13:14.237
Jordan?

13:15.340 --> 13:16.572
I can't..

13:18.143 --> 13:19.375
I can't breathe.

13:20.245 --> 13:21.355
My chest..

13:21.379 --> 13:23.057
Jordan, are you alright?

13:23.081 --> 13:24.514
I..

13:31.737 --> 13:33.549
It's.. Suddenly I can't..

13:33.573 --> 13:35.739
I feel-I feel, I feel like
I can't really breathe.

13:37.343 --> 13:38.453
You're having an anxiety attack.

13:38.477 --> 13:39.688
A-are you sure?

13:39.712 --> 13:41.657
My-my heart is beating really
fast and my chest hurts.

13:41.681 --> 13:44.560
That's exactly what it is.
Just sit down. Don't talk.

13:44.584 --> 13:45.783
Breathe.

13:46.719 --> 13:48.497
This never happened before.

13:48.521 --> 13:49.665
Do you think it's because
of your fight

13:49.689 --> 13:51.600
last night with Rainer?

13:51.624 --> 13:53.402
That was..

13:53.426 --> 13:55.559
This GMA interview. All of it.

13:56.696 --> 14:00.309
What about the phone call
this morning?

14:00.333 --> 14:03.645
That was a reporter that
threatened to expose my past.

14:03.669 --> 14:06.315
The guy who was up here
asking you questions?

14:06.339 --> 14:08.584
No, no, someone else now.

14:08.608 --> 14:11.420
Now, every other reporter
is gonna be in my face.

14:11.444 --> 14:14.389
The paparazzi, the people,
it's all just too much!

14:14.413 --> 14:17.392
I can feel it.

14:17.416 --> 14:18.615
They're closin' in. I..

14:20.753 --> 14:23.732
You were right about what you
said to me last night.

14:23.756 --> 14:26.468
I had a really messed up childhood.

14:26.492 --> 14:28.737
Only a couple people
out here know that.

14:28.761 --> 14:30.672
Nina and Rainer.

14:30.696 --> 14:32.774
But it doesn't matter now.

14:32.798 --> 14:35.344
Pretty soon, everyone
is gonna know this about me

14:35.368 --> 14:37.346
if that reporter keeps at it.

14:37.370 --> 14:40.782
The thing about secrets is that
people can hold them over you.

14:40.806 --> 14:43.452
The only way for people
not to have that power over you

14:43.476 --> 14:45.387
is if you own your truth.

14:45.411 --> 14:46.555
Tell your side of the story.

14:46.579 --> 14:48.757
You don't know how this works?

14:48.781 --> 14:50.581
I can lose my career.

14:50.816 --> 14:52.516
Go to prison.

14:57.757 --> 15:00.669
Why did I do that?

15:00.693 --> 15:03.438
Why am I so stupid?
Why did I drink so much?

15:03.462 --> 15:05.440
You did it for Jake.

15:05.464 --> 15:08.677
Yeah. Look where all that got me.

15:08.701 --> 15:11.368
By the way,
why did you both come over?

15:12.571 --> 15:16.285
Partly because we were worried
that you'd been abducted

15:16.309 --> 15:20.377
and also because he had
a surprise for you.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.781
What?

15:25.584 --> 15:27.618
Cassy?

15:28.654 --> 15:31.555
- I shouldn't.
- But you're going to.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.772
Jake decided to submit
"Stealing Georgia" as a short

15:36.796 --> 15:38.740
instead of trying to finish it
as a feature

15:38.764 --> 15:41.343
because shorts can sometimes
attract a lot of attention

15:41.367 --> 15:43.312
and he wants to do it
with your footage.

15:43.336 --> 15:46.315
Oh, God, now I feel so stupid.

15:46.339 --> 15:49.573
We just had this big fight.
Why didn't he leave with that?

15:50.576 --> 15:51.753
Wait, what do we have left to shoot

15:51.777 --> 15:53.689
on the movie if we do that?

15:53.713 --> 15:56.458
I think just the suitcase scene.

15:56.482 --> 15:58.816
And I can totally do it
'cause today's my last day.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.664
I really hope..

16:02.688 --> 16:05.500
...this turns things around
for me and Jake

16:05.524 --> 16:08.303
'cause we were so happy
shooting "Stealing Georgia"

16:08.327 --> 16:12.563
and... I just wanna get back to happy.

16:13.332 --> 16:14.676
I hear ya.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.600
I hate it when you guys fight.

16:19.438 --> 16:22.439
Is there a time I could stop by
set tonight to see you?

16:22.775 --> 16:25.654
Mm.. Tonight?

16:25.678 --> 16:29.591
Probably not, because I get my
top ripped open

16:29.615 --> 16:34.329
and my throat slashed,
so it's maybe not a good night.

16:34.353 --> 16:38.767
Well, I really appreciate that
you're here, Cass.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.691
I know you're really tired.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.305
Is it okay if I crash here?

16:43.329 --> 16:44.573
I don't think I'm gonna make it home.

16:44.597 --> 16:46.396
Of course.

16:47.433 --> 16:48.565
Thanks.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.588
Well?

16:59.612 --> 17:01.390
This is amazing.

17:01.414 --> 17:02.557
Do you have a producer yet?

17:02.581 --> 17:03.658
The buddy who brought it to me

17:03.682 --> 17:05.694
already has a writer
and director on board.

17:05.718 --> 17:06.728
And Ryan Gosling..

17:06.752 --> 17:08.396
You know, but.. I-I, I'd..

17:08.421 --> 17:11.665
I wouldn't want this to get
in the way of, of us.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.635
Do you think that producer's
gonna stick?

17:13.659 --> 17:15.337
Yeah, I'm gonna package him
with my agency

17:15.361 --> 17:16.738
so it's pretty much a done deal.

17:16.762 --> 17:20.342
But more importantly, what did
you think of the role of Carrie?

17:20.366 --> 17:22.477
I mean, i-it's perfect
for Sloane, right?

17:22.501 --> 17:24.613
Well, I think all the roles are good.

17:24.637 --> 17:28.316
I mean, it's a moving, amazing story.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.651
And I was thinking

17:29.675 --> 17:32.521
the part of Charlie
is perfect for Rainer.

17:32.545 --> 17:34.456
Don't you think?

17:34.480 --> 17:36.691
Oh, he can do a lot more than
action movies.

17:36.715 --> 17:39.528
Wait till you see his
performance in "Locked."

17:39.552 --> 17:41.396
I-I don't think I'd be able
to get insurance.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.597
It will cost a fortune.

17:42.621 --> 17:44.699
Well, Robert Downey Jr. turned
it around. Look at him now.

17:44.723 --> 17:48.437
He's one of the biggest Box
Office draws the industry has.

17:48.461 --> 17:49.704
And they waited till he was sober.

17:49.728 --> 17:52.707
They didn't put him
in a movie for years.

17:52.731 --> 17:56.445
Oh, no. No, no, no. That's not
why I gave you the material.

17:56.469 --> 17:59.536
I, I really.. I just wanted
your expert opinion.

18:00.372 --> 18:03.452
And my expert opinion is..

18:03.476 --> 18:05.520
...in a few years you're gonna
be shopping for a new tuxedo

18:05.544 --> 18:07.489
because "Redemption Ridge"
is gonna win

18:07.513 --> 18:09.658
every Oscar it's up for.

18:09.682 --> 18:11.460
I just wish I could be a part of it.

18:11.484 --> 18:13.550
Alright, that's great.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.264
Okay. So, uh, I'm gonna go.

18:16.288 --> 18:17.666
I'm gonna get this to Sloane..

18:17.690 --> 18:19.434
...I'm gonna see what she thinks.

18:19.458 --> 18:20.535
You know, I just.. I..

18:20.559 --> 18:23.493
I didn't wanna do this
without your opinion.

18:26.365 --> 18:27.442
Dinner tonight?

18:27.466 --> 18:29.478
Uh, you're not gonna believe this

18:29.502 --> 18:32.547
but while you were out getting coffee

18:32.571 --> 18:34.583
Rainer texted me and asked me
for the wrap party.

18:34.607 --> 18:35.617
I mean, it's just, you know

18:35.641 --> 18:37.586
after the movie finishes shooting

18:37.610 --> 18:38.720
but I..

18:38.744 --> 18:40.655
- Can you believe it?
- Well, that's great.

18:40.679 --> 18:43.492
- You should definitely go.
- Uh, do you wanna come?

18:43.516 --> 18:45.594
No, you should go.

18:45.618 --> 18:48.430
Sounds like Rainer's finally
reaching out to you.

18:48.454 --> 18:49.698
Yeah.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.703
- August, no!
- 'No!'

19:02.635 --> 19:05.347
'Cutting! Resetting!'

19:05.371 --> 19:07.649
Okay, the director needs a
couple more takes of y'all

19:07.673 --> 19:09.618
flyin' through the wormhole.

19:12.678 --> 19:14.456
How you holdin' up, Paige?

19:14.480 --> 19:15.812
Not the best for a hangover.

19:16.749 --> 19:19.427
So, um..

19:19.451 --> 19:21.363
Did you guys hear
what happened between

19:21.387 --> 19:23.453
Katie make-up and Wendy hair?

19:24.523 --> 19:26.268
No, what are you talking about?

19:26.292 --> 19:29.337
Katie make-up was yelling
pretty loudly.

19:29.361 --> 19:31.695
I thought they were really close.

19:32.565 --> 19:34.576
It's the last day of shooting.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.545
- And?
- People get weird.

19:36.569 --> 19:37.829
I had a rough morning myself.

19:38.704 --> 19:40.604
It's like they're losing a family.

19:41.674 --> 19:43.351
'We spend all this
intense time together'

19:43.375 --> 19:44.653
only to have it abruptly end.

19:44.677 --> 19:46.388
I mean, you may work
with some of them again

19:46.412 --> 19:47.678
but it's never the same.

19:57.423 --> 20:00.557
Speaking of the end, you goin'
to the wrap party tonight?

20:01.660 --> 20:03.672
I, I really didn't know there was one.

20:03.696 --> 20:06.341
Tradition.
Everyone just parties on stage.

20:06.365 --> 20:08.543
Well, I'm definitely not drinking.

20:08.567 --> 20:09.611
Hey, me neither.

20:09.635 --> 20:11.513
'Look at us.'

20:11.537 --> 20:12.736
You should come.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.718
You going, Jordan? You should.

20:16.742 --> 20:20.555
It's been a lot of time
with this family.

20:20.579 --> 20:22.779
I didn't plan on it,
but I could stop by.

20:24.383 --> 20:25.549
Good.

20:33.626 --> 20:34.803
What are you doing here?

20:34.827 --> 20:37.539
We didn't get a chance
to finish our conversation.

20:37.563 --> 20:39.407
'I know that you're upset.'

20:39.431 --> 20:41.865
I just, I want a chance
to explain myself.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.603
I care about you.

20:47.506 --> 20:48.739
You know that.

20:50.376 --> 20:53.610
But I, I take my work with
Trending Ocean really seriously.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.824
It's my passion and I really wanted

20:55.848 --> 20:57.714
our fundraiser to be a success.

20:58.784 --> 21:02.364
But I put those goals over you.

21:02.388 --> 21:03.620
And I'm sorry.

21:05.791 --> 21:07.557
Really.

21:09.361 --> 21:10.560
Baby..

21:13.666 --> 21:15.510
I'm not trying to make more excuses

21:15.534 --> 21:17.801
but I'm used to doing
those fundraisers by myself.

21:19.638 --> 21:21.571
You know that about me from rehab.

21:22.474 --> 21:24.441
I don't share well with others.

21:25.577 --> 21:28.523
But I should've included
you more and I'm sorry.

21:28.547 --> 21:30.325
Well, clearly, it was all for nothing

21:30.349 --> 21:33.328
because people were too busy
drinking our free booze

21:33.352 --> 21:35.619
and partying so you can get money.

21:37.489 --> 21:39.668
We made money.

21:39.692 --> 21:40.802
Not on the silent auction stuff

21:40.826 --> 21:43.705
but we actually made a lot of money.

21:43.729 --> 21:47.409
- 1.8 million to be exact.
- Really?

21:47.433 --> 21:49.577
The trustafarians loved
what you had to say

21:49.601 --> 21:51.746
about surfing in a clean ocean
and the bank execs

21:51.770 --> 21:54.416
that I talked to, they decided
to make Trending Ocean

21:54.440 --> 21:56.685
the corporate write-off for the year.

21:56.709 --> 22:00.555
Babe, we make such a good team
and we can go national.

22:00.579 --> 22:02.457
We could open an office
in New York City.

22:02.481 --> 22:04.781
Maybe you could take some time
off after "Locked" wraps.

22:06.485 --> 22:10.554
You know, I actually think
that's a really great idea.

22:15.694 --> 22:17.405
Jake?

22:17.429 --> 22:19.574
'We need to give
this money back, Landon.'

22:19.598 --> 22:21.576
'If not there's a special place
in hell for us.'

22:21.600 --> 22:23.400
And that's where we're both headed.

22:27.506 --> 22:29.451
What is this? What's going on?

22:29.475 --> 22:32.409
I-I thought you were cutting
"Stealing Georgia" as a short.

22:33.345 --> 22:34.589
Wait, the suitcase scene?

22:34.613 --> 22:37.592
That's the last scene that we
have to shoot in the movie.

22:37.616 --> 22:38.748
You..

22:45.262 --> 22:48.474
Why didn't you talk to me
before making this deci...

22:48.475 --> 22:49.841
No, I tried calling you.

22:51.611 --> 22:54.523
The shot just works better with
Billy now since we rewrote it.

22:54.547 --> 22:57.393
And I have a deadline
I'm trying to meet.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.750
Today's my last day. Seriously?

23:01.388 --> 23:03.466
Can we just talk
in the kitchen, please? I..

23:03.490 --> 23:07.658
Uh, I'll go.
Um, I-I'll go outside. Sorry.

23:08.661 --> 23:10.673
The action stuff we shot
in the apartment

23:10.697 --> 23:12.757
worked better than the stuff
we shot in the Bixby.

23:14.367 --> 23:15.600
It just did.

23:16.469 --> 23:17.680
'And it's not just that.'

23:17.704 --> 23:20.316
Okay? We-we did a lot of rewrites.

23:20.340 --> 23:21.517
Rewrites that had to be done.

23:21.541 --> 23:24.353
Rewrites that made the script better.

23:24.377 --> 23:27.423
'And-and then I-I-I became
a better director.'

23:27.447 --> 23:30.760
Uh, this whole process
I've improved and so, yeah..

23:30.784 --> 23:33.484
I got to change everything
I got wrong the first time.

23:36.322 --> 23:37.855
Including casting me?

23:42.662 --> 23:45.563
No, don't. I.. I don't wanna cry.

23:50.670 --> 23:52.581
It's not about you.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.550
Then what is it about?

23:54.574 --> 23:56.619
Are you punishing me?

23:56.643 --> 23:58.587
Are you punishing me for last night?

23:58.611 --> 24:02.491
Is-is.. Nothing happened with Rainer!

24:02.515 --> 24:04.427
Cassy told me that you were
coming over to tell me

24:04.451 --> 24:07.430
that you were using
our film, our footage

24:07.454 --> 24:10.599
our baby, and-and now,
suddenly you aren't.

24:10.623 --> 24:13.269
No. Okay, no. It's not Rainer.

24:13.293 --> 24:14.603
I'm a better director now, that's it.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.439
No, that is such bullshit!

24:16.463 --> 24:17.695
And you know it!

24:19.332 --> 24:22.445
You're gonna stand in front
of me and be a coward

24:22.469 --> 24:24.702
and pretend that it is
about your film making.

24:25.605 --> 24:27.383
What have we come to?

24:27.407 --> 24:29.618
You know, or maybe I'm..

24:29.642 --> 24:31.554
Maybe I'm making an excuse too

24:31.578 --> 24:33.622
one that I can actually
stump me because

24:33.646 --> 24:36.414
what you're also not saying is..

24:40.420 --> 24:42.364
...you like her version
better than mine.

24:42.388 --> 24:45.468
No. No, Paige, that's not true.

24:45.492 --> 24:49.538
I have to go. I have to go to set.

24:49.562 --> 24:52.575
It's my last day,
which is ironic because

24:52.599 --> 24:55.411
you decided that I wasn't worth

24:55.435 --> 24:58.669
waiting one more day for.

25:00.740 --> 25:02.807
One more day!

25:47.353 --> 25:48.664
- Paige!
- Oh!

25:48.688 --> 25:51.789
My name's Jeremy. I'm a tour
guide here at Gold Brothers.

25:52.792 --> 25:55.504
Hi. I'm sorry, uh, you..

25:55.528 --> 25:58.340
Uh, literally just scared
everything out of me.

25:58.364 --> 26:01.310
I come by here five, six times a day.

26:01.334 --> 26:02.645
Sometimes I come in when you're
just shooting a scene

26:02.669 --> 26:04.480
and just watch.

26:04.504 --> 26:06.549
I'm a big fan of yours.

26:06.573 --> 26:10.486
I just wanna tell you how much
I've enjoyed working with you.

26:10.510 --> 26:13.556
I just love your acting style
and your approach to the craft.

26:13.580 --> 26:15.513
Thank you.

26:16.449 --> 26:17.682
Hey, new car?

26:18.518 --> 26:19.728
I miss your old junker.

26:19.752 --> 26:22.586
What did you call it? The Rabbit?

26:24.424 --> 26:28.526
Yeah, yeah, uh, Th-the Rabbit.
It's awesome, um..

26:30.363 --> 26:32.763
I-I actually still have it
in the garage.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.615
I'll miss seeing you.

26:39.639 --> 26:42.707
I hope you get another role here
at Gold Brothers real soon.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.377
I'll see you around.

26:47.380 --> 26:48.612
Bye.

27:12.405 --> 27:14.583
- It's your turn to die!
- What the hell, dude?

27:14.607 --> 27:16.807
'Cut! That's a cut!'

27:17.677 --> 27:18.777
'Go again.'

27:20.546 --> 27:21.624
What was wrong with that?

27:21.648 --> 27:23.726
Blaine..

27:23.750 --> 27:26.261
...you're not supposed to rip
the shirt completely off.

27:26.285 --> 27:27.529
'If you see the tattoo on her stomach'

27:27.553 --> 27:29.498
you'll know she's of the family.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.434
Okay, going again. Back to one.

27:32.458 --> 27:33.636
'Back to one on the bell.'

27:33.660 --> 27:35.392
'And action!'

27:37.597 --> 27:38.741
Help!

27:42.468 --> 27:44.568
Now it's your turn to die!

27:45.538 --> 27:49.318
'Cut! Cut! Let's do this again.'

27:49.342 --> 27:52.743
'Okay, guys, we need you to go again.'

27:54.347 --> 27:56.325
Help!

27:56.349 --> 27:57.648
Help!

27:59.419 --> 28:00.629
Now it's your time to die, bitch.

28:00.653 --> 28:02.398
Not tonight, it isn't.

28:04.624 --> 28:06.524
- 'Cut!'
- Oh!

28:08.628 --> 28:10.528
Career is so over.

28:17.903 --> 28:19.280
What the hell was that?

28:19.304 --> 28:22.283
You just decide to go off script
and practically kill me?

28:22.307 --> 28:24.285
Me, you're the one who went off
script and decided

28:24.309 --> 28:26.020
to choke me with your death grip.

28:26.044 --> 28:28.289
And last time, you actually
cut off my air supply!

28:28.313 --> 28:30.992
- Cassandra.
- I know, I screwed up.

28:31.016 --> 28:32.894
I'm sorry, I will get my things.

28:32.918 --> 28:35.296
Where did that come from?
That was amazing!

28:35.320 --> 28:39.267
Truly inspiring, what you did..
It.. That's so real just now.

28:39.291 --> 28:41.269
Her character is not supposed
to get away.

28:41.293 --> 28:43.304
- That's not scripted.
- Exactly. Exactly.

28:43.328 --> 28:45.139
It's not in the script,
but it should be.

28:45.163 --> 28:47.175
Cassandra, now I'm thinking,
y-you're not third girl to die.

28:47.199 --> 28:49.110
You're the fifth,
or the, or the sixth.

28:49.134 --> 28:50.311
I'm re-writing the script.

28:50.335 --> 28:52.947
Yeah, you know, we're gonna
give the audience a real

28:52.971 --> 28:55.250
good old fashioned
Ripley-type heroine.

28:55.274 --> 28:58.441
Congratulations, Cassandra.
You live to die another day.

29:02.214 --> 29:06.027
Well, looks like I moved up
on the call sheet.

29:06.051 --> 29:08.930
And by the way,
my name's Cassandra Perkins.

29:08.954 --> 29:10.932
You should probably remember it
'cause it looks like

29:10.956 --> 29:12.576
we'll be working together for a while.

29:22.167 --> 29:23.978
Wow.

29:24.002 --> 29:27.037
Can't believe... this is really it.

29:27.973 --> 29:29.984
It's actually over.

29:30.008 --> 29:31.975
Endings are sad but important.

29:32.377 --> 29:34.923
- Yeah.
- But just you watch.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.324
Next film, you'll immediately
fall in love

29:36.348 --> 29:37.959
with a whole new crew.

29:37.983 --> 29:39.894
Happens every movie.

29:39.918 --> 29:41.896
Because there's much
drama on this one.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.264
I mean, Jordan wasn't even
gonna show up

29:43.288 --> 29:45.366
until he heard that Tangey
was off recording.

29:45.390 --> 29:47.268
And Alexis..

29:47.292 --> 29:51.172
...is not here because of everyone.

29:51.196 --> 29:55.331
Just, not sure if all
of us like the beginning again.

29:57.035 --> 29:58.980
I'm gonna go to the bar.
You want a drink?

29:59.004 --> 30:02.083
No, thank you. I'm not doing
that for a very long time.

30:02.107 --> 30:04.919
Copy that, PT, I'll catch you later.

30:04.943 --> 30:06.054
Bye.

30:25.998 --> 30:28.042
See, if you take a few frames out here

30:28.066 --> 30:30.211
then it might sync up perfectly.

30:30.235 --> 30:33.369
Look, I need to say
something about all of this.

30:34.206 --> 30:36.217
Sure. Anything.

30:36.241 --> 30:38.953
If you need to go with Paige
as the lead, I totally get it.

30:38.977 --> 30:40.188
No. No, no, no, come on.

30:40.212 --> 30:43.024
We rewrote the script, it's a
completely different movie now.

30:43.048 --> 30:45.393
- But that isn't her fault.
- No, of course not.

30:45.417 --> 30:48.129
It's no one's fault,
look, this isn't about

30:48.153 --> 30:50.453
punishment or who I'm dating
or any of that.

30:52.224 --> 30:53.434
The fight you saw earlier
had absolutely nothing

30:53.458 --> 30:55.003
to do with you.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.204
So sit on it.

30:56.228 --> 30:58.172
I mean, what's the rush, Jake?

30:58.196 --> 30:59.496
It has to be this year.

31:00.932 --> 31:03.077
No, because Paige's cruise
is taking off

31:03.101 --> 31:05.947
and if I'm... still struggling making

31:05.971 --> 31:07.281
these crappy little movies

31:07.305 --> 31:09.172
she's not gonna wanna be with me.

31:10.175 --> 31:12.320
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

31:12.344 --> 31:15.411
But I'll be okay
with whatever you decide.

31:42.374 --> 31:45.074
Hey. Rainer.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.256
- Harper.
- Nina.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.290
Glad you could make it.

31:49.314 --> 31:51.181
Too bad Alan's out of town.

31:52.350 --> 31:55.296
Um, you mind if I join you?

31:55.320 --> 31:57.253
Go ahead and have a seat.

31:58.457 --> 32:00.902
I'm just gonna..

32:00.926 --> 32:02.392
...make a little speech first..

32:04.129 --> 32:06.140
...so make yourself comfortable.

32:17.275 --> 32:19.153
Hi, everyone.

32:19.177 --> 32:21.377
Uh, I just want to take
a moment to say a few words.

32:25.050 --> 32:26.482
You've all been so good to me.

32:28.086 --> 32:30.331
'As you all know I..'

32:30.355 --> 32:33.356
'...went through a lot during
the production of this movie.'

32:34.292 --> 32:36.104
But..

32:36.128 --> 32:40.174
...the one silver lining,
my one saving grace..

32:40.198 --> 32:42.098
...was that you were all there for me

32:43.001 --> 32:44.334
and supported me.

32:48.406 --> 32:51.119
And it wasn't just the obvious people.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.321
I felt the outpouring
of love and support

32:53.345 --> 32:55.223
from all the departments.

32:55.247 --> 32:59.293
Many of you whom I've known,
really, my whole life.

32:59.317 --> 33:02.118
And, if I haven't known
you my whole life..

33:03.054 --> 33:04.988
...it feels like I have.

33:07.392 --> 33:11.127
So, I-I just want
you all to know that..

33:12.130 --> 33:14.342
...I love each and every one of you..

33:14.366 --> 33:17.011
...from the bottom of my heart.

33:17.035 --> 33:18.368
'We love you, man.'

33:21.139 --> 33:24.274
Which is why it's so hard
for me to tell you all..

33:28.113 --> 33:29.313
...that I'm leaving Hollywood.

33:32.050 --> 33:33.416
'For good.'

33:36.054 --> 33:37.331
'Acting served its purpose'

33:37.355 --> 33:41.057
'and... I'm moving on.'

33:42.227 --> 33:44.305
So, this really is a wrap

33:44.329 --> 33:46.129
for Rainer Devon.

34:00.947 --> 34:02.498
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:02.499 --> 34:05.512
So, I guess I should
say goodbye to you now

34:05.536 --> 34:08.313
because it sounds
like you're leaving tomorrow.

34:08.338 --> 34:11.417
Nah, don't forget
we'll have ADR sessions.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.485
Maybe a re-shoot or two.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.443
You can't get rid of me that easily.

34:23.487 --> 34:25.331
Why do I feel like
you're not as into Rainer

34:25.355 --> 34:26.632
leaving as he is?

34:26.657 --> 34:29.702
Oh. You're mistaken, Nina.

34:29.726 --> 34:31.371
I want whatever's best for Rainer

34:31.395 --> 34:33.339
and if getting out of Hollywood
is what he needs

34:33.362 --> 34:34.674
then that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.732
Leaving is the
biggest mistake of his life.

34:38.601 --> 34:40.280
I know my son.

34:40.304 --> 34:42.681
And what he wants most
is critical acclaim.

34:42.706 --> 34:46.252
He's dreamt of getting
an Oscar his entire life.

34:46.275 --> 34:48.388
Well, no offense,
but he's not getting one

34:48.411 --> 34:50.389
for the types of movies
that you produce.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.312
Hey, Mr. Devon, how's it goin'?

35:12.336 --> 35:15.248
Octavio. Looking better, my friend.

35:15.272 --> 35:17.216
I know what you mean, man,
I've three teenagers

35:17.240 --> 35:18.318
about to go to college.

35:18.342 --> 35:19.722
This could be better for me too.

35:23.347 --> 35:24.646
Octavio.

35:28.352 --> 35:29.562
Keep it.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.563
What?

35:30.587 --> 35:31.631
This will put at least

35:31.655 --> 35:33.333
two of them through college.

35:33.357 --> 35:34.701
But you don't, you don't really

35:34.725 --> 35:36.436
mean for me to keep the car.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.404
Yes. It's yours.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.239
Registration's in the glove box,
I'll officially

35:40.263 --> 35:41.474
sign it over to you tomorrow.

35:41.498 --> 35:43.343
I can't believe that you..

35:47.371 --> 35:49.248
Thank you, Mr. Devon.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.417
You're welcome, Octavio.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.353
Thank you for always being
so good to me.

35:53.377 --> 35:54.377
Oh.

36:06.356 --> 36:08.668
Hey, what's going on?
Where's he taking the car?

36:08.692 --> 36:10.570
I gave it to Octavio.

36:10.594 --> 36:12.505
We don't a need a car in New York.

36:12.529 --> 36:14.407
We don't need it..

36:14.431 --> 36:15.697
How are we getting home?

36:16.667 --> 36:18.578
A nice looking dude named Ahmad

36:18.602 --> 36:21.414
is gonna be picking us
up at gate four.

36:21.438 --> 36:24.283
Okay, Rainer, you need a meeting.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.585
You are not okay right now.

36:25.609 --> 36:27.709
I just put two kids through college.

36:28.512 --> 36:29.689
I've never been better.

36:41.558 --> 36:44.303
'Your backdoor is open.'

36:44.327 --> 36:46.272
'Your backdoor is open.'

36:46.296 --> 36:47.306
'Your backdoor is open.'

36:47.330 --> 36:48.474
What's the..

36:48.498 --> 36:50.643
'Your backdoor is open.'

36:50.667 --> 36:53.279
'Your backdoor is open.'

36:53.303 --> 36:55.448
'Your backdoor is open.'

36:55.472 --> 36:57.550
'Your backdoor is open.'

36:57.574 --> 37:00.219
'Your backdoor is open.'

37:00.243 --> 37:02.388
'Your backdoor is open.'

37:02.412 --> 37:04.490
'Your backdoor is open.'

37:04.514 --> 37:06.592
'Your backdoor is open.'

37:06.616 --> 37:08.428
'Your backdoor is open.'

37:19.696 --> 37:21.574
Brian, it's Nina.

37:21.598 --> 37:24.477
I need you to track down
the number of an author.

37:24.501 --> 37:27.447
Marva Dunwoody.

37:27.471 --> 37:30.483
She wrote a manuscript
that Steve Silver is packaging.

37:30.507 --> 37:32.285
"Redemption Ridge."

37:32.309 --> 37:35.288
Yeah, just get it for me by tomorrow.

37:35.312 --> 37:38.224
Yes, I want you to start working
on it right now.

37:38.248 --> 37:39.447
Yes, now!

37:49.593 --> 37:51.571
You know, you don't
have to retire retire.

37:51.595 --> 37:53.428
You can just take a break.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.475
I'm thinking we should start

37:55.499 --> 37:57.376
a Trending Ocean on the East Coast.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.479
And we should relocate to make
sure it gets off the ground.

37:59.503 --> 38:01.214
Yeah, but we don't have to do that.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.583
We can just hire someone
to set up the East Coast branch.

38:03.607 --> 38:06.619
You know, I just-I don't
think... we need to rush this.

38:06.643 --> 38:08.654
No, I feel really confident

38:08.678 --> 38:10.623
that this is exactly
what we should do.

38:10.647 --> 38:13.292
I can go solo and set it up.

38:13.316 --> 38:14.527
I wouldn't wanna leave
those big decisions

38:14.551 --> 38:16.562
up to just anyone, you know?

38:16.586 --> 38:17.630
Hmm..

38:17.654 --> 38:19.298
I think Manhattan is the place to be.

39:24.521 --> 39:26.432
And, and, Jordan, I have to say

39:26.456 --> 39:28.634
I know there's a lot of Oscar
buzz surrounding you

39:28.658 --> 39:31.404
after your Golden Globe win.

39:31.428 --> 39:33.294
- Good stuff.
- Yeah.

39:33.697 --> 39:35.608
But, Jordan, that all changed

39:35.632 --> 39:37.243
after the news broke

39:37.267 --> 39:39.378
that you and Nina Devon had an affair

39:39.402 --> 39:41.380
possibly when you were a minor.

39:41.404 --> 39:44.250
Uh, I was-I was eighteen.

39:44.274 --> 39:45.585
Are you protecting Nina Devon?

39:45.609 --> 39:47.620
Because you were on the
"Backsplash" set

39:47.644 --> 39:49.255
when you were sixteen.

39:49.279 --> 39:50.456
I was eighteen

39:50.480 --> 39:52.391
but I like to talk about my film.

39:52.415 --> 39:56.495
Rainer Devon is a good friend
of yours, correct?

39:56.519 --> 39:59.265
And have you spoken to him
since the scandal broke?

39:59.289 --> 40:00.788
What does he think about all this?

40:03.627 --> 40:05.705
See, that's the thing about
secrets, they always come out.

40:05.729 --> 40:08.341
No matter what they come out.

40:08.365 --> 40:11.366
Uh.. And what do you,
what do you mean by that?

40:12.302 --> 40:14.602
My real name is Jordan Michaels.

40:15.572 --> 40:17.617
'I'm, I'm not an orphan.'

40:17.641 --> 40:20.253
'My mom, she served
six years in prison'

40:20.277 --> 40:22.388
'for killin' her boyfriend.'

40:22.412 --> 40:24.479
'But the thing is, she didn't do it.'

40:25.615 --> 40:26.615
'I did.'

40:27.717 --> 40:31.586
'This guy, he, he beat her,
he beat me..'

40:33.523 --> 40:35.423
...for years.

40:36.493 --> 40:38.371
And one day,
he was takin' it out on her

40:38.395 --> 40:39.527
and I..

40:40.497 --> 40:42.397
I fought back.

40:45.302 --> 40:46.667
I killed him.

40:47.604 --> 40:49.615
'Wow, um..'

40:49.639 --> 40:52.351
I think we're all in shock.

40:53.576 --> 40:56.677
Is-is there anything else
that you'd like to add, Jordan?

40:57.480 --> 40:58.624
No.

40:58.648 --> 41:02.328
Just that, Nina, she,
she knew all my mistakes.

41:02.352 --> 41:04.697
'All the things
I was tryin' to hide, and..'

41:04.721 --> 41:06.599
'...she believed in me anyway.'
