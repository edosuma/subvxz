You're done working on my son.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.747
- Carmen and I started a thing,
then we broke up.

00:08.791 --> 00:10.662
- Then he got her
on the rebound, right?

00:10.706 --> 00:11.794
- There's more to it.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.839

Donors are fleeing.

Doctors are getting poached

00:18.540 --> 00:20.411
- Why are you here, Mr. Shentu?

00:20.455 --> 00:22.022
- Reputational management.

00:28.811 --> 00:29.942
- You okay?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.509
- It's paperwork

00:31.553 --> 00:33.250
- Didn't know you were married.
- It's over.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.078
He's just dragging it out.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.427
- I need an MRI.

Me in a gym, crazy right?

01:30.916 --> 01:32.788
Buddy, been meaning
to give you a call.

01:32.831 --> 01:35.182
I heard the last surgery was
a big success.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.574
- Yeah.

Doctor says I should be able

an in-home nurse, Felicia.

- Yeah. I need to go see him.

- But you're not cleared
to drive yet though, are you?

02:17.311 --> 02:18.486
- No, no.
I'll just order a car.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.617

- I thought
all this was finalized.

No, I don't want to speak
to my husband directly.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.154
That's why I hired a lawyer.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.459
Listen, I'm at work.

about your divorce?

Andrew would keep the house

02:45.382 --> 02:46.557
in Grosse Point.

Now, suddenly,
he wants to sell it

02:48.037 --> 02:49.386
and give me half the proceeds.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.909

02:50.953 --> 02:52.781
- No, he's up to something.

02:52.824 --> 02:56.132
He's trying to lure me in.
It's a control thing.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.917
Sorry, this must be so boring.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.485
- No, it's fascinating.
I'm riveted.

03:01.529 --> 03:04.706
- Sure. What's in the bag?

03:04.749 --> 03:06.273
- My suit.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.754
Remember, we're going
to the gala tonight?

03:09.798 --> 03:11.060
- Yes, of course.

too much on your plate--

Let's firm all this up later,
okay?

03:21.723 --> 03:22.898

34 weeks pregnant.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.559
Vitals all stable.

03:31.602 --> 03:32.690
- Collapsed on the floor
and lost consciousness

03:32.734 --> 03:34.083

Husband called 911.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.346
He was right behind us.
- Thanks.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.130
- Hi, Lisa, I'm Dr. Hammer.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.523
How you feeling?
- Fine.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.046
I just got
a little lightheaded.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.526
It's not a big deal.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.224
- Let's take a quick look,
okay?

03:44.267 --> 03:45.355
Let's get the ultrasound.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.314
- Do we really need to do that?

03:47.357 --> 03:48.402
- We just want to make sure

03:48.445 --> 03:49.881
that everything looks okay
in there.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.709
I mean,
you're here already, right?

03:51.753 --> 03:53.407
- I just want to get out
as fast as possible.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.799
- I understand.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.714
- Hi, Lisa,
your husband's here.

03:56.758 --> 03:57.846
- Is she okay?

03:57.889 --> 03:59.282
- I told you already,
I'm fine, Jonah.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.545
This is a complete
waste of time.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.026
- Well,
the placenta appears normal,

04:04.069 --> 04:05.462
which is a good sign.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.116
But your baby's breech.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.597
You might be having it
sooner than you think.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.555
- See? I told you something
was going on.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.470
- Has she told you yet
that she's anemic?

04:13.514 --> 04:15.385
- No, but good to know.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.561
Okay, let's get
a CBC, PTT, a KB,

04:17.605 --> 04:19.302
and a fingerstick
for blood glucose.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.435
- I--I don't need all of that.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.654
- They're just lab tests
to make sure that you're okay.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.352
- Yeah, if you give me
the name of your OB,

04:25.395 --> 04:27.179
I can contact him
for you if you like.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.051
- I'm no longer seeing my OB.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.705
- Go ahead, tell them why.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.837
- Okay, don't do this, Jonah.
- Fine. I'll tell them.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.100
Because her OB had
the audacity to suggest

04:35.144 --> 04:37.277
that Lisa get vaccinated,
but she didn't want to.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.495
- Enough, okay?

04:38.539 --> 04:40.845
That's my decision
as a mother to make.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.325
No one else's.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.326
And I don't appreciate you
trying to recruit

04:43.370 --> 04:45.807
more soldiers to your cause.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.330
I feel isolated enough already.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.853
- This has been going on
for months.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.942
- Okay, stop!
What is she doing?

04:50.986 --> 04:52.422
- She's drawing some blood.
- No.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.598
I--I just wanna go back home
and get ready

04:54.642 --> 04:56.339
for the home birth
with my doula as planned.

04:56.383 --> 04:59.429
- Hey, Lisa, you know, anemia
can greatly increase the risk

04:59.473 --> 05:01.083
of adverse events
during delivery.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.258
- I know that already.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.999
We can manage.

05:04.042 --> 05:06.044
- Damn it, Lisa, stop messing
around with our baby's health.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.132
Listen to the doctors.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.484
- It's really best to be sure.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.357
- Fine.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.098
Run your test.
- Oh, good.

I want you out of here.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.364
- This is my baby too.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.844
- I said get out.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.935
Do I need to have you
call security?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.894
- Why don't you come with me?

05:29.938 --> 05:31.156
There's a waiting area

Dry cleaner closes at 6:00,

you're going to
the fundraising gala tonight?

that my attendance is--

05:59.794 --> 06:01.099
thank you--mandatory.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.449
- Well, it makes sense.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.799
The hospital wants
to parade around its stars.

06:04.842 --> 06:05.930
- I'm not complaining.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.149
It's actually
kind of refreshing

06:07.192 --> 06:09.151

Well, why don't you meet up
with me before hand?

06:11.109 --> 06:12.676
Let me buy you a drink.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.026

06:16.332 --> 06:18.203
Can't imagine
I'll find the time.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.167
Today's the day, Dorothy.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.429
How you feeling?

06:26.473 --> 06:30.346

my new liver.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.175
Chad and I couldn't get here
fast enough when you called.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.090
- Mom and I are pretty stoked.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.874
- Yeah, well, after all
the time you've been waiting,

06:36.918 --> 06:38.398
I believe it.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.966
Your labs are showing
that your blood sugar's at 240.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.882
- Mm, it's always a roller
coaster with my diabetes.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.580
- Yes,
but your white blood cell count

06:46.623 --> 06:49.452
is also elevated to 18,000.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.280
Numbers like this usually
indicate that your body

06:51.323 --> 06:52.803
is fighting
some sort of infection.

06:52.847 --> 06:55.153
Have you been feeling
worse than normal?

06:55.197 --> 06:58.026
- It's hard to know
what normal is anymore.

06:58.069 --> 07:01.072
I been feeling so crummy
this last year.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.857
- Dorothy,
you mind if I examine you?

07:02.900 --> 07:04.162
- Sure.
- Okay.

07:04.206 --> 07:07.035
You feeling cold?
- No more than usual.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.428
- Do you mind
if I remove the jacket?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.868
Ooh.

07:13.911 --> 07:16.087
- I was trying to warm my feet
by the radiator

07:16.131 --> 07:18.699
the other night,
and I guess I got too close.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.222
- Uh-huh.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.442
- Didn't even feel it
for some reason.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.053
- That's the neuropathy
from the diabetes.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.358
- Let's have a look.

07:26.402 --> 07:29.449
- Yeah, burned yourself
pretty bad there.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.103
It's definitely infected.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.368
- Okay, we are gonna need
IV antibiotics for that.

07:36.412 --> 07:38.849
So excuse us while we go
flag down a nurse.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.330
- Yeah, let's leave this open
for air.

07:41.373 --> 07:42.505
Keep it off, okay?

07:42.549 --> 07:43.854
- Okay.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.078
- What do you think?

07:50.121 --> 07:51.383
- We can't give her steroids

07:51.427 --> 07:52.733
or put her
on immunosuppressants

07:52.776 --> 07:54.865
with an infection like that.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.606
- There's no way, right?

07:56.650 --> 07:58.086
- Feel terrible for her.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.175
- So what do you wanna do now--

08:01.132 --> 08:02.786
- Is this gonna be a problem?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.701
- Unfortunately,
your mother's infection

08:04.745 --> 08:07.095
presents potential
complications for her surgery.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.792
So we're gonna have to postpone
it for a later date.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.925
- What about the liver?

08:10.968 --> 08:12.709
- It'll go
to another recipient.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.322
<i>♪</i>

08:22.589 --> 08:23.720
That's not fair.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.113
- I understand
your disappointment.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.331
But trying to transplant
a liver

08:26.375 --> 08:27.594
when your mother has
an infection

08:27.637 --> 08:29.117
is just too dangerous.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.858
- My mom's been waiting
for this liver

08:30.901 --> 08:32.686
for almost a year now.

08:32.729 --> 08:33.948
We'll take the risk.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.602
- Unfortunately,
I'm obligated to ensure

08:35.645 --> 08:37.168
that the organ is transplanted

08:37.212 --> 08:39.823
under the most optimal
conditions possible.

08:39.867 --> 08:42.434
- That's your concern?

08:42.478 --> 08:44.306
The liver, not my mom?

08:44.349 --> 08:45.873
- Of course I'm concerned
for your mother.

08:45.916 --> 08:46.917
But as you well know,

08:46.961 --> 08:48.136
these livers are
in short supply.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.617
- Stop.
Here's how this is gonna go.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.096
You're gonna go back in there

08:52.140 --> 08:53.445
and you're gonna prep
my mom for surgery--

40:48.184 --> 40:49.795

40:50.796 --> 40:55.191
Buddy, I am so sorry to have
to tell you this, but, um,

40:55.235 --> 40:57.063
your dad just passed away.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.981

to see him die.
