* [eerie music]

00:05.606 --> 00:11.145
**

00:11.179 --> 00:12.046
[slurp]

00:12.080 --> 00:13.414
The last time I was here,

00:13.447 --> 00:16.617
I woke them and ended up
with a mane full of bats!

00:16.650 --> 00:19.820
[sigh] Thanks for being
my basket holder, Spike.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.756
Basket holder? I thought
I was your bodyguard.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.793
What? Oh yes, yes.
That of course, too.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.164
Oh for once I wish
unicorn magic wasn't so...

00:30.198 --> 00:31.399
luminescent.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.437
Spike, you'll wake the
bats! Turn that off!

00:36.470 --> 00:39.473
I can't! Oooh!

00:39.507 --> 00:40.508
[gasp]

00:40.541 --> 00:41.509
[squeaks]

00:44.112 --> 00:47.415
* My little pony,
my little pony *

00:47.448 --> 00:49.350
* Aaaahhh

00:49.383 --> 00:51.419
* My little Pony

00:51.452 --> 00:53.821
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

00:53.854 --> 00:55.689
* My Little Pony

00:55.723 --> 00:58.292
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

00:58.326 --> 01:00.361
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:00.394 --> 01:02.530
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:02.563 --> 01:04.665
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:04.698 --> 01:06.667
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:06.700 --> 01:08.802
* To have my little pony

01:08.836 --> 01:13.574
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:13.607 --> 01:15.309
**

01:21.149 --> 01:22.883
Twilight: I'm so glad
you two could come.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.153
Of course. We so
rarely get a chance

01:25.186 --> 01:26.787
to relax and just visit.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.357
There's usually some crisis
we have to deal with.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.193
Somepony always needs
our help. But today--

01:32.226 --> 01:36.564
HELP! Twilight! There's
something wrong with Spike!

01:39.333 --> 01:40.868
Twilight: What's wrong?

01:40.901 --> 01:43.604
I don't know! [grunt]
All of the sudden

01:43.637 --> 01:46.640
my scales just started
glowing and burning.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.909
Little is known
about dragon culture,

01:48.942 --> 01:51.745
but this is a phenomenon
we've seen before.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.482
It is the Call of
The Dragon Lord.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.717
Dragons glow whenever
the Dragon Lord

01:56.750 --> 01:59.187
has need of them
in the Dragonlands.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.890
Great! [groan] How
do I make it stop?

02:02.923 --> 02:06.260
The only way to end the
summons is to answer it.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.895
You must journey
to the Dragonlands

02:07.928 --> 02:09.797
and see what is
expected of you.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.634
But the Dragonlands
are full of... dragons!

02:13.667 --> 02:15.336
And they're
ghastly creatures!

02:17.271 --> 02:19.307
Oh-oh not you of
course, Spikey Wikey.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.941
But remember that
rotten Garble?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.810
[gulp] How could
I forget?

02:22.843 --> 02:25.579
He would have burnt us to a
crisp if you weren't there.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.348
If I have to go to
the Dragonlands,

02:27.381 --> 02:28.849
would you two come with me?

02:28.882 --> 02:32.186
Oooh! Oh my goodness! I'd
love to! We are sadly lacking

02:32.220 --> 02:34.655
any information on dragon
culture and customs.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.924
I could research them, maybe
even write an article!

02:36.957 --> 02:39.193
This could be my chance to
make a great contribution

02:39.227 --> 02:40.428
to the knowledge of Equestria!

02:42.696 --> 02:45.399
And be there for
Spike, of course.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.867
Be very careful.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.936
The Dragonlands are
particularly dangerous

02:48.969 --> 02:52.473
for ponies. It would
be wise to be discreet.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.509
Oh, I'm sure I still have
the dragon costume we used

02:55.543 --> 02:58.246
the last time we snuck into
the Dragonlands! [giggle]

02:58.279 --> 02:59.647
I think we might
want something

02:59.680 --> 03:01.282
a little more
practical this time.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.618
[chattering teeth]

03:04.652 --> 03:06.287
Rarity: Well, it may
be practical,

03:06.320 --> 03:08.956
but this disguise isn't
flattering in the slightest!

03:08.989 --> 03:10.924
Twilight: It's not supposed
to be flattering;

03:10.958 --> 03:12.526
it's supposed to blend in!

03:12.560 --> 03:13.694
SHHHH!

03:13.727 --> 03:15.463
[snarl]

03:19.600 --> 03:23.737
Hey, look. It's our old
friend, Sparkle Warkle.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.473
It's Spike.

03:25.506 --> 03:29.310
Are you sure your pony friends
didn't give you a pony name?

03:29.343 --> 03:32.313
It's nice to see
you too, Garble!

03:32.346 --> 03:34.882
I didn't say it was nice
to see you. It's not.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.285
I don't like you.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.653
Was I not clear about that?

03:39.687 --> 03:41.622
[sneeze]

03:41.655 --> 03:43.657
Hey! That's my rock.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.927
Oh really? Then why
aren't you sitting on it?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.297
[mean laughter]

03:49.330 --> 03:51.899
* [dramatic music]

03:51.932 --> 03:57.438
**

03:57.471 --> 04:01.342
Dragons of Equestria! Hear me!

04:01.375 --> 04:03.444
I have been Dragon
Lord for longer

04:03.477 --> 04:05.746
than many of you
can remember.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.816
And my reign has
been extraordinary.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.652
AGREE WITH ME!

04:12.720 --> 04:15.389
[All agreeing at once]

04:15.423 --> 04:17.024
Torch! Torch! Torch!

04:18.459 --> 04:19.960
Who is that?

04:19.993 --> 04:22.029
It's Dragon Lord Torch, dummy.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.931
No, next to him.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.334
That's his daughter,
Princess Ember.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.469
I wouldn't even look
at her if I were you.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.970
Unless you want
Torch to eat you.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.672
[gulp]

04:31.705 --> 04:34.908
This is fascinating! Dragons
are notoriously reckless,

04:34.942 --> 04:37.511
but they do whatever
the Dragon Lord says.

04:37.545 --> 04:41.449
Unfortunately,
according to dragon law,

04:41.482 --> 04:45.586
it is time for me to
step down. Sad, I know.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.590
BE SAD!

04:49.623 --> 04:52.493
[all groaning]

04:52.526 --> 04:54.595
This is why I have
summoned you.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.865
To compete for the throne
in the Gauntlet of Fire!

04:57.898 --> 05:00.734
[excited shouts]

05:00.768 --> 05:01.902
[teeth chattering]

05:01.935 --> 05:04.738
Whomever has the
strength and fortitude

05:04.772 --> 05:07.641
to retrieve this
Bloodstone Scepter

05:07.675 --> 05:09.943
from the heart of
the Flamecano

05:09.977 --> 05:14.047
will be crowned Lord
of the Dragons!

05:19.152 --> 05:20.988
[explosion]

05:21.789 --> 05:23.424
[whoosh]

05:25.393 --> 05:28.128
When the scepter disappeared,
the dragons stopped glowing!

05:28.161 --> 05:30.498
We are learning so much!

05:30.531 --> 05:34.402
Ah ah ah ....

05:34.435 --> 05:35.703
choo!

05:35.736 --> 05:37.571
Uh, Excuse me.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.974
Ugh. You even
sneeze like a pony.

05:41.008 --> 05:45.813
The Gauntlet is dangerous,
for I designed it myself.

05:45.846 --> 05:50.818
Only dragons with my ferocity,
strength and determination

05:50.851 --> 05:52.886
will be able to finish.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.790
We will gather at the cliff
when the sun is at its peak!

05:56.824 --> 05:58.659
[cheers]

05:58.692 --> 06:00.861
I don't want to be Dragon
Lord or dragon toast

06:00.894 --> 06:02.863
and I stopped glowing so
let's sneak out of here!

06:05.633 --> 06:09.036
Where do you think you're
going, little dragon?

06:12.039 --> 06:16.477
Oh, uh, hi Your Lordship.
I was just going home.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.112
You don't get to leave
unless I say you can.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.551
Dad, look at him!
He's just a runt.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.987
Besides, he doesn't even
want to compete. Let him go.

06:27.020 --> 06:33.193
He is rather tiny. I could
squish him with my pinky claw.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.729
[weak laugh]

06:35.763 --> 06:37.898
That wasn't a joke;
it was a fact.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.201
When I want you to laugh
I will say "BE AMUSED"!

06:41.234 --> 06:43.036
Of course, Your Lordship.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.173
I guess I don't understand
dragon customs.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.075
Another reason why
I shouldn't compete.

06:49.977 --> 06:53.180
Very well, little
dragon. I release you.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.448
Thank you!

06:54.482 --> 06:55.583
And thank you.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.189
Where do you think you're going?

07:02.222 --> 07:03.857
To prepare for the gauntlet.

07:03.891 --> 07:07.628
No, you're not. You're not
much bigger than that runt

07:07.661 --> 07:09.196
I just sent home.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.465
But I'm smarter than most
of these boulderheads

07:11.499 --> 07:13.066
and you know it.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.069
Being smart won't help
you win this gauntlet.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.773
It was designed for a
big strong dragon to win

07:19.807 --> 07:23.043
because it takes a big
strong dragon to lead.

07:23.076 --> 07:26.146
Besides, I SAID NO!

07:26.179 --> 07:29.583
I hate when he does that!

07:29.617 --> 07:32.486
[chattering]

07:32.520 --> 07:34.087
When I become Dragon Lord,

07:34.121 --> 07:36.890
I will make burps an
official greeting.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.926
Ha, you? Please.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.529
When I win, I will
pillage Equestria

07:41.562 --> 07:42.963
for all their pillows!

07:42.996 --> 07:44.898
Why should these
ponies be comfortable

07:44.932 --> 07:46.967
while we sleep on rocks?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.603
That's nothing.
When I'm in charge,

07:49.637 --> 07:53.073
the first thing I'll do is get
revenge on those puny ponies!

07:53.106 --> 07:55.976
They'll regret they
ever crossed Garble!

07:56.009 --> 07:58.245
We'll take whatever
we want from Equestria

07:58.278 --> 08:00.881
and burn the rest.

08:00.914 --> 08:04.284
Rarity: Oh my gosh. I can't
believe I'm saying this,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.887
but I hope that
burping dragon wins.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.121
Spike: None of them can win!

08:08.155 --> 08:11.191
Equestria is in big trouble
if any of them are in charge!

08:11.224 --> 08:12.760
Twilight: But what
can we do?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.863
There's only one thing to
do and only I can do it.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.832
I have to win the
Gauntlet of Fire!

08:18.866 --> 08:19.900
[whimper]

08:24.872 --> 08:27.307
What do you mean you
have to win the Gauntlet?

08:27.340 --> 08:30.243
It's the only way to protect
Equestria from the dragons!

08:30.277 --> 08:32.312
You heard them. They have
horrible plans for ponies

08:32.345 --> 08:35.983
if they win! So somehow,
I have to do it.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.651
There has to be another way!

08:37.685 --> 08:38.986
It's too dangerous.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.022
Besides, if you win,
you'd have to stay here!

08:42.055 --> 08:45.258
I know. But there's no other
way to keep my friends safe.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.962
Well, if you're
staying to compete,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.664
then we're staying
to cheer you on.

08:53.233 --> 09:00.240
**

09:00.941 --> 09:03.744
I thought I released
you, Tiny One.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.947
I decided to compete. I
am a dragon, after all.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.583
Are you sure? You
can't even fly!

09:09.617 --> 09:12.886
[mocking laughter]

09:12.920 --> 09:15.255
All dragons are
welcome to compete,

09:15.288 --> 09:17.791
for they do so at
their own peril.

09:17.825 --> 09:21.361
Flying to Flamecano Island is
the first of many challenges

09:21.394 --> 09:26.033
you will face in your quest to
find the Bloodstone Scepter!

09:26.066 --> 09:28.268
[roar]

09:30.738 --> 09:33.674
Good luck. Just kidding,
I hope you lose.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.142
Aaaaah!

09:35.175 --> 09:36.043
[splash]

09:38.979 --> 09:42.249
Thanks, Garble, I was
planning on swimming anyway!

09:43.817 --> 09:45.252
You can do it, Spike!

09:49.056 --> 09:55.028
[screeches]

10:01.702 --> 10:02.369
[splash]

10:04.237 --> 10:05.605
He's gonna drown!

10:06.406 --> 10:07.307
SPIKE!

10:17.084 --> 10:18.986
Hey, are you OK?

10:19.019 --> 10:20.754
[coughing]

10:20.788 --> 10:23.757
[gasping]

10:23.791 --> 10:25.292
Princess Ember!

10:25.325 --> 10:27.194
What do you think you're doing?

10:27.227 --> 10:29.229
Rarity: Only saving your
ungrateful scales!

10:30.463 --> 10:32.232
Did that seaweed just talk?

10:35.202 --> 10:38.005
Ponies? What are
they doing here?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.339
They're my friends!

10:39.372 --> 10:43.043
Friends? Dragons
don't do friends.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.178
Well, this dragon does!

10:45.212 --> 10:48.916
Whatever. I don't care as long
as none of you get in my way.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.684
I have a gauntlet to win.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.952
But I thought your dad said...

10:51.985 --> 10:53.921
I don't care what my dad said!

10:53.954 --> 10:56.189
I'll show him and
everydragon who thinks

10:56.223 --> 10:58.158
I'm just a little "Princess"

10:58.191 --> 11:00.160
there are better things
than being big and strong!

11:02.362 --> 11:03.296
Aaah!

11:04.898 --> 11:05.766
[thud]

11:11.004 --> 11:12.272
Don't leave me here, Spike!

11:14.775 --> 11:16.309
[grunt]

11:16.343 --> 11:18.946
Ha ha! I knew you'd do it.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.448
Your pony friends made you soft.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.449
[splat]

11:22.482 --> 11:24.117
Uh-huh. You're welcome.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.887
For what? I didn't
say thank you.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.221
[sniff]

11:28.255 --> 11:30.991
Wow, you even smell like ponies.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.325
[sniffing]

11:32.359 --> 11:34.094
Or is it coming from over there?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.435
[deep voice] Uh, that's just me.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.773
I uh, robbed some ponies
on my way over here.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.440
I like your style.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.443
Have I met you before?
You kinda look like--

11:50.477 --> 11:55.715
My uh, old neighbor,
uh, Sandy Rockbeach!

11:57.184 --> 11:59.953
Stupid slingtails
knocked me down.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.456
But I've wasted enough time
making small talk. Get it?

12:03.490 --> 12:06.159
Because you're too small
to win this. I'm funny.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.462
Why did you cover for me?

12:09.496 --> 12:11.531
You could have had
one less competitor.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.034
I could ask you the same thing.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.903
You could have told
Garble about my friends.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.775
Yikes. That looks rough.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.811
But that's what
makes it a challenge.

12:23.844 --> 12:27.280
Are you kidding? Those
boulders are huge!

12:27.314 --> 12:29.316
Hey, what if we
work together?

12:30.951 --> 12:33.220
You fly me up there and
I'll help you look out

12:33.253 --> 12:35.055
for boulders like a
second set of eyes!

12:35.088 --> 12:35.989
Rarity: PSSST!

12:39.126 --> 12:40.093
Spike!

12:42.095 --> 12:44.865
Are you sure it's a good
idea to team up with Ember?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.466
You don't know her too well.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.836
I do know she could have
told Garble about you,

12:48.869 --> 12:51.004
but she didn't. I
think we can trust her.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.940
Her behavior does seem
contradictory to everything

12:52.973 --> 12:54.307
I've noted about
dragons so far.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.543
Hey! You. Little fella.

12:56.576 --> 13:00.580
I've thought about it and your
plan makes sense. Let's do it.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.816
Really? Great! It's a deal.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.855
Just so you know, this doesn't
mean we're gonna pick flowers

13:07.888 --> 13:11.258
or exchange necklaces or
whatever pony friends do.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.093
Good luck. We'll
meet you at the top.

13:14.227 --> 13:21.234
**

13:25.405 --> 13:27.140
Pull up, there's
one on your tail!

13:27.174 --> 13:30.978
**

13:31.011 --> 13:31.879
Go left!

13:38.919 --> 13:40.153
So, what do we do now?

13:40.187 --> 13:41.321
I think we go through there.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.191
[whoosh]

13:49.997 --> 13:52.299
Rarity: Ah! Oh,
that looks scary!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.601
I mean, you can do it!

13:54.634 --> 13:57.971
Listen, Spike, I wouldn't have
made it this far without you.

13:58.005 --> 14:01.875
So I guess, if you want to, we
could keep working together.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.543
I mean, just until we
get through that tunnel.

14:03.576 --> 14:04.544
OK.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.080
We'll be right behind you.

14:07.114 --> 14:11.952
**

14:11.985 --> 14:14.054
[slam slam slam]

14:24.064 --> 14:25.632
[grunt]

14:32.039 --> 14:33.073
[groan]

14:38.946 --> 14:39.612
[gasp]

14:46.253 --> 14:47.120
Agh!

14:48.221 --> 14:49.589
[groan]

14:49.622 --> 14:50.590
[thud]

14:55.562 --> 14:59.199
Rarity: Oh, you made it!
Oh, we were so worried.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.901
About us? Pssh. That
tunnel was cake.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.973
Wait, how did you
two get through?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.307
[rumbling]

15:07.340 --> 15:09.709
[screams]

15:09.742 --> 15:10.944
Rarity!

15:10.978 --> 15:17.117
**

15:17.150 --> 15:19.119
Oh thanks, Spike!

15:19.152 --> 15:20.653
It was nothing.

15:20.687 --> 15:24.257
Nothing? You just risked
everything to save her.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.394
And they're putting themselves
in danger just to support you.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.129
That's just what friends do.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.464
Don't you have anyone
who looks out for you?

15:31.498 --> 15:34.734
Not really. Unless
I count you...

15:34.767 --> 15:37.737
...which I don't because we
were only helping each other

15:37.770 --> 15:40.507
get through the tunnel and now
we're through the tunnel so,

15:40.540 --> 15:41.708
that's it.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.576
Wait. What do you mean?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.613
Well, there's only one
winner, one scepter

15:46.646 --> 15:48.348
and one Dragon Lord.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.985
So I guess it's every
dragon for themselves.

15:52.019 --> 15:55.255
Oh. So we aren't
really friends?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.257
Maybe if we were in ponyland

15:57.290 --> 16:00.060
but like I said, dragons
don't do friendship.

16:00.093 --> 16:04.131
**

16:11.038 --> 16:13.206
I can't believe
Ember ditched me.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.543
Oh you're better off. She was
only looking out for herself.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.711
She's just like all
the other dragons.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.647
She's not, though. I know it.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.383
She saved me, even when
she didn't have to.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.386
I don't care what she says.
That makes us friends.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.689
Twilight: Is it just me or
have we seen this crevice

16:29.722 --> 16:31.324
three times already?

16:31.358 --> 16:34.461
It's kind of hard to tell.
They all look the same.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.163
Except for this one! Look!

16:40.333 --> 16:42.435
We made it!

16:42.469 --> 16:45.272
I can't believe I'm the only
dragon to make it this far.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.440
You're not!

16:47.474 --> 16:51.478
And I'm not losing to a puny
pony-loving dragon like you!

16:53.680 --> 16:55.515
[gasp] We have to
do something!

16:55.548 --> 16:56.416
Look!

16:57.784 --> 17:02.389
[shouts]

17:02.422 --> 17:06.059
Ember! I thought it was
every dragon for themselves.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.427
Why did you save me?

17:07.460 --> 17:12.199
That's what friends do.
And I am. I mean we are.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.234
I never should have
left you back there.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.070
Ugh, please don't make me
talk about my feelings.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.205
What the--?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.446
Spike! Get the scepter!

17:26.479 --> 17:27.847
**

17:27.880 --> 17:35.088
[shouts]

17:39.292 --> 17:46.299
**

17:48.501 --> 17:50.237
Aaaaagh!

17:52.539 --> 17:55.808
I'm sick and tired of you
two helping each other!

17:55.842 --> 17:58.511
Dragons don't do helping!

17:58.545 --> 18:00.480
These dragons do!

18:18.598 --> 18:20.467
Whoa!

18:20.500 --> 18:23.903
[whoosh]

18:23.936 --> 18:27.140
[zap]

18:31.778 --> 18:34.614
Spike: Leave her alone!

18:34.647 --> 18:38.385
What? You? You have the scepter?

18:38.418 --> 18:40.287
But that means that you're...

18:40.320 --> 18:43.556
The Dragon Lord.
Dragon Lord Spike.

18:45.492 --> 18:49.562
Aw. Dragon Lord Spike.

18:49.596 --> 18:53.666
That's right. Uh,now go start
your long journey home.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.169
And give every dragon
you see on the way a hug.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.570
Don't tell them why.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.607
Aw, but that'll be
super embarrassing!

19:00.640 --> 19:02.475
I command you to do it!

19:02.509 --> 19:06.679
Ugh. I can't believe this.

19:06.713 --> 19:10.183
"Dragon Lord Spike". Hmm.
Has a nice ring to it.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.819
Dragon Lord Ember
sounds a lot better.

19:12.852 --> 19:16.356
What? No. You're
the Dragon Lord now.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.225
The Dragon Lord is whoever
brings the scepter back

19:18.258 --> 19:19.526
to your father.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.894
Besides, you'll
make a great leader.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.364
I was just doing this
to protect the ponies,

19:24.397 --> 19:27.234
but I know you'll protect them
just as well as I would have.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.735
Are you sure about this?

19:28.768 --> 19:32.339
Absolutely. My home is in
Equestria with my friends.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.908
Well, you'll have at least
one friend here, too.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.377
What are you doing?

19:37.410 --> 19:39.479
It's called a hug.

19:39.512 --> 19:43.182
Oh. I don't know if
I like it, but OK.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.286
Aw.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.798
Ember? You?

19:58.831 --> 20:02.269
I know you didn't think
I could do it, but I did.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.872
I expressly told you NOT TO
DO IT! Because you're not--

20:05.905 --> 20:09.576
--I'm not big and strong!
I know! But you know what?

20:09.609 --> 20:12.845
I won anyway. So, maybe it
takes more than just being

20:12.879 --> 20:15.315
big and strong to be
a good Dragon Lord.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.287
I was wrong, Ember.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.924
You might not be big, but
you are strong. And smart.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.994
And perhaps that counts
for more than I thought.

20:28.027 --> 20:32.265
And you will make
an excellent leader.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.667
Thanks, Dad.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.303
AGREE WITH HIM!

20:37.937 --> 20:40.840
Just kidding. That's
not gonna be my thing.

20:40.873 --> 20:44.411
[laughter]

20:44.444 --> 20:46.746
Dragons, hear me!

20:46.779 --> 20:51.551
I present to you our new
Dragon Lord... Ember!

20:51.584 --> 20:54.387
[cheers]

20:54.421 --> 20:58.525
* [trumpet fanfare]

20:58.558 --> 21:00.460
What is the meaning of this?

21:00.493 --> 21:02.495
I can't tell you!

21:02.529 --> 21:04.964
[laugh]

21:04.997 --> 21:07.834
You did well, Spike. With
Ember as Dragon Lord,

21:07.867 --> 21:09.802
the ponies will be safe
and you've gained us

21:09.836 --> 21:11.371
a powerful ally.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.805
And a new friend.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.041
Plus, Ember said I could
write to her any time

21:15.074 --> 21:17.009
I had questions
about dragon culture!

21:17.043 --> 21:18.578
With this much information,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.813
I'll be able to write a
whole book on dragons!!

21:20.847 --> 21:23.850
And I gained tons of
ideas for a new line

21:23.883 --> 21:28.555
of camouflage clothing! I
think I'll call it camo-mod.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.590
[laughter]
