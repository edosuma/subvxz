WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:04.738
( crowd clamoring
over rock music intro )

00:07.308 --> 00:09.543
( whistle blowing )

00:09.610 --> 00:12.913
* Saturday night
I was downtown *

00:12.980 --> 00:16.384
* Workin' for the FBI *

00:16.450 --> 00:19.487
* Sittin' in a nest
of bad men *

00:19.553 --> 00:23.291
* Whiskey bottles
piling high... *

00:23.357 --> 00:24.558
( shouting, gunfire )

00:24.625 --> 00:27.828
* Bootleggin' boozer
on the west side *

00:27.895 --> 00:31.565
* Full of people
who are doin' wrong *

00:31.632 --> 00:34.402
* Just about
to call up the D.A. man *

00:34.468 --> 00:38.872
* When I heard this woman
singin' a song *

00:38.939 --> 00:41.275
( crackling hiss )

00:41.342 --> 00:44.578
* A pair of .45's made me
open my eyes *

00:44.645 --> 00:48.549
* My temperature started
to rise *

00:48.616 --> 00:52.320
* She was a long cool woman
in a black dress *

00:52.386 --> 00:55.856
* Just a five-nine
beautiful tall *

00:55.923 --> 00:58.959
* With just one look
I was a bad mess *

00:59.026 --> 01:04.598
* 'Cause that long cool woman
had it all... *

01:09.403 --> 01:12.306
I'm pretty sure there's an ATM
around here somewhere.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.842
I don't want to
wander around downtown

01:14.908 --> 01:16.144
at this time
of night.

01:16.210 --> 01:20.114
Don't worry. If we don't find
one here, we'll go back.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.382
Ah, here's one.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.717
You never listen to me.

01:25.153 --> 01:28.389
( explosion, woman screams )

01:31.192 --> 01:34.262
( sirens blaring,
indistinct radio transmission )

01:37.131 --> 01:39.733
Hey, guys.
It's an Army recruiting office.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.769
We had the victim
standing here at the ATM.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.971
His wife's in shock,
but she's stable.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.439
He died on the scene.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.907
DAVID: Bomb looks to
be homemade.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.710
We'll need the chem
work-up to know more.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.545
MEGAN: It's an interesting
choice of targets.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.014
High profile,
and low risk of casualties.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.816
Antiwar protest?

01:55.883 --> 01:57.251
Maybe just somebody

01:57.318 --> 01:59.487
with an axe to grind
against the Army.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.122
Well, someone's definitely gonna
take responsibility for this.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.791
MEGAN:
You were right.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.427
This came in last night,
just before the bomb went off.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.128
You having any luck
tracing this?

02:08.196 --> 02:09.863
It's been routed
through so many servers,

02:09.930 --> 02:11.432
I can't promise anything.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.434
MEGAN:
"This act is in retaliation

02:13.501 --> 02:15.035
"for an illegal war begun
at the behest

02:15.102 --> 02:16.970
-of U.S. imperialists..."
-Wait. It's signed

02:17.037 --> 02:18.272
the Weather
Underground?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.773
The protest group
from the '70s?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.675
Maybe somebody's
having a flashback.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.676
Weather Underground

02:22.743 --> 02:25.279
were radicals
disguised as patriots.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.814
They're willing to use

02:26.880 --> 02:29.850
any means necessary to
accomplish their ends.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.286
Today, we call them terrorists.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.588
Uh, Agent Thomas Lawson.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.156
Retired.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.925
Back in my day, uh,

02:37.991 --> 02:41.329
all we had was a couple of
IBM Selectrics

02:41.395 --> 02:42.830
and a telephone.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.132
I'm sorry. Can we help you
with something?

02:45.199 --> 02:46.600
Chief of Criminal Division

02:46.667 --> 02:48.336
-called me this morning.
-MEGAN: Why is that?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.604
You had a bombing
at a recruitment center.

02:50.671 --> 02:54.041
We had an identical
bombing at an ROTC office

02:54.107 --> 02:55.876
35 years ago to the day.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.779
And you think
it's the same people?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.748
Same person.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.116
DON:
Matthew Stirling?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.752
He was a member
of a local

03:04.818 --> 03:07.588
radical group
from '69 to '71.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.590
He was responsible
for three bombings,

03:09.657 --> 03:12.660
including the one at the ROTC
which killed two people.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.328
Where is he now?

03:14.395 --> 03:16.096
Never apprehended.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.165
His current whereabouts
were unknown

03:18.232 --> 03:20.368
until this morning.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.071
We all use math every day,

03:24.137 --> 03:25.906
to predict weather,

03:25.973 --> 03:27.908
to tell time,

03:27.975 --> 03:30.478
to handle money.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.215
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.618
It's logic... rationality.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.620
It's using your mind

03:39.687 --> 03:42.956
to solve the biggest mysteries
that we know.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.503
The e-mail is almost identical

03:55.569 --> 03:58.506
to a letter received
by the FBI in '71,

03:58.572 --> 04:00.408
except instead of "Vietnam,"

04:00.474 --> 04:01.975
the new letter
reads "Iraq."

04:02.042 --> 04:02.943
DAVID:
Bomb materials,

04:03.010 --> 04:04.912
composition and placement
are all similar.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.247
I know you guys didn't use
math consultants back then, but

04:07.315 --> 04:08.416
meet my brother Charlie.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.217
He's going to do
a statistical assessment

04:10.284 --> 04:11.352
of crimes from back then.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.186
Compare it to this one here.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.123
Given the length of time between
these bombings, this is going

04:16.189 --> 04:17.257
to be a great
challenge.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.058
LAWSON:
Maybe.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.060
If you were looking
for a different perpetrator.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.430
We haven't ruled out the
possibility of a copycat yet.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.664
LAWSON:
You're wasting time.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.399
-Time you haven't got.
-DON: We're gonna look

04:25.466 --> 04:26.567
into Stirling as well as

04:26.634 --> 04:28.502
some current groups with
similar profiles, so...

04:28.569 --> 04:30.438
LAWSON: The day after Stirling
was questioned

04:30.504 --> 04:34.141
about the ROTC bombing,
he went underground.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.243
He abandoned a
wife and baby.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.746
The bomb he set killed

04:38.812 --> 04:40.381
two people.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.917
Thomas O'Keefe, 17.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.855
Albert Whitetower, 16.

04:47.921 --> 04:51.291
I was the one that had to knock
on their parents' door

04:51.359 --> 04:53.627
to tell them their
kid was dead.

04:53.694 --> 04:57.765
Next time, it'll be you.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.601
Somebody blew up a car.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.102
That's an antiwar act?

05:02.169 --> 05:03.571
A military vehicle,

05:03.637 --> 05:05.939
parked outside
of an Army recruiting office

05:06.006 --> 05:06.774
where somebody
was killed.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.008
MAN:
Hello, Antiwar Coalition.

05:08.075 --> 05:08.842
May I help you?

05:08.909 --> 05:10.578
You might want
to round up some

05:10.644 --> 05:11.879
of the local
high school parents.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.181
I understand a lot of them
aren't too happy

05:14.247 --> 05:16.584
with the Army's on-campus
recruitment tactics.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.151
Your organization called
for resistance

05:18.218 --> 05:19.319
against the United States.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.854
The war
on Iraq is illegal,

05:20.921 --> 05:24.291
and any resistance is
protected by international law.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.225
Vandalism and violence aren't.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.861
We're gonna need to take
a look at all the e-mails

05:27.928 --> 05:29.329
coming and going
into your office.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.198
Then you're gonna need
a warrant.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.966
Maybe.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.868
Look, try to pull any of that
Patriot Act stuff,

05:34.935 --> 05:36.203
and you'll get plenty
of press.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.605
I don't doubt it.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.839
You're wasting your time.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.874
We didn't have anything to do
with it.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.544
Really? Cross your heart
and hope to die?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.514
Hey!

05:46.580 --> 05:48.181
So, what do you think of this?

05:48.248 --> 05:49.950
Wow.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.351
You got it done fast.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.421
Yeah. I found it
in the original designs.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.889
The people who owned the place
before us-- they tore them out.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.758
Can't imagine why
they did that.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.027
Well, people did a lot
of stupid things in the '70s.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.930
I take it you're not just
talking about home remodeling.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.098
Here are the files
from the ROTC bombing.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.634
Oh, great.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.503
So you think this guy Stirling
was involved with these recent

06:09.570 --> 06:11.371
bombings, huh,
after all these years?

06:11.439 --> 06:12.506
ALAN:
Stirling?

06:12.573 --> 06:14.374
You're talking
about Matt Stirling?

06:14.442 --> 06:16.510
Yeah. Why?

06:16.577 --> 06:19.379
Well, I knew him.
We worked together.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.381
You did? At City Hall?

06:21.449 --> 06:23.417
No. Californians for Peace.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.386
We organized
volunteers.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.821
Matty worked
with the local colleges.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.724
You were an antiwar protester?

06:30.791 --> 06:33.393
I participated in peaceful
demonstrations, so did Matt.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.830
Dad, Matt Stirling is the one
who blew up the ROTC Center.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.098
He killed two innocent kids.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.634
Matt Stirling's guilt was
never proven in a court of law.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.169
Yeah, because he took off.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.537
Look, I knew Matt Stirling.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.938
He had a wife, he had a child.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.807
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about evidence.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.876
-What evidence?
-Those files right there,

06:48.942 --> 06:50.077
to begin with!

06:50.143 --> 06:53.213
Oh, come on. You guys probably
had twice that much on the man

06:53.280 --> 06:55.583
you mistakenly accused
of the Madrid train bombings.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.817
We're trying
to stop someone

06:56.884 --> 06:58.552
from killing innocent people
here.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.521
So were we.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.731
Hey.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.200
Hey.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.536
I didn't know Dad was
so... active back then.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.471
Yeah, well, I kind of
forgot about it

07:17.538 --> 07:20.107
until I was joining the bureau.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.609
Came out in my background check.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.443
Was he ever arrested?

07:23.511 --> 07:24.377
Oh, yeah. Twice.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.312
Twice?

07:25.378 --> 07:27.347
Sit-ins.
I was, like, three.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.483
Mom and Dad both took me
to a march.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.318
LAPD hauls Dad off in cuffs.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.654
Dad has an FBI file.

07:33.721 --> 07:34.822
-Uh-huh.
-What's in it?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.256
Well, that's the thing.
It's funny.

07:36.323 --> 07:40.528
You know, I mean, I never wanted
to read it that closely.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.964
By the time I was born,
the war was over.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.466
Yeah. Well, lucky you.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.604
All right, Don.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.340
What about
this bomb investigation?

07:53.406 --> 07:57.578
Well, I mean,
Stirling's our prime suspect,

07:57.645 --> 08:00.147
but 35 years--
that's a long time.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.216
You know, you've got a lot
of data here from the old case,

08:03.283 --> 08:05.886
and I might be able
to run an application of math

08:05.953 --> 08:07.487
called social network analysis,
which analyzes

08:07.555 --> 08:08.421
the structure of groups.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.158
Might tell us how Stirling fit
in to Californians For Peace,

08:11.224 --> 08:12.325
and who he worked with.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.827
Could it tell if
he was involved

08:13.894 --> 08:15.162
in something like the
Weather Underground?

08:15.228 --> 08:17.297
-Oh, quite possibly.
-And if it was a copycat?

08:17.364 --> 08:20.668
The analysis might very well
identify likely suspects.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.172
Coming up empty with e-mails
and phone records.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.874
There's nothing to indicate

08:26.940 --> 08:28.742
that any of the local
antiwar groups

08:28.809 --> 08:29.943
are planning anything
like this.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.045
LAPD's anti-terrorist
surveillance indicates

08:32.112 --> 08:33.581
these groups are organizing
demonstrations

08:33.647 --> 08:35.916
to mark the start of the war
in the spring.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.851
So we're back
to looking at a copycat.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.452
Well, either that,
or Lawson's right,

08:39.519 --> 08:40.588
and Stirling's resurfaced.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.455
It's possible.
Serial bombers often claim

08:42.522 --> 08:45.926
political motivations,
but it's a sociopathic drive.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.561
It's the same
as serial killers.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.663
They can go underground
for years, and then return

08:49.730 --> 08:52.132
to violence if circumstances
bring up old obsessions.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.234
Circumstances like a new war,
new climate of protest?

08:54.301 --> 08:58.672
You got it, but if it is him,
more than likely, he's gonna

08:58.739 --> 09:00.140
contact somebody
from his past.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.247
Yeah, Matt and I were
very good friends back then.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.982
But that was back then.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.450
You worked together
in the peace movement.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.285
And I admired Matt,
I really did.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.121
But the things we did--

09:14.187 --> 09:15.589
I don't believe
in them anymore.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.890
Are you saying
you were involved

09:16.957 --> 09:19.092
-in violence?
-No, no, none of us were.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.894
No, just those protests,

09:20.961 --> 09:22.429
when the troops needed
our support,

09:22.495 --> 09:24.965
coming back from
that hellhole.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.300
That's something
I wish I'd never been a part of.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.003
Dad. Hey, Wilkie's at the
Culver City site, he says

09:30.070 --> 09:31.571
the concrete
hasn't shown up yet.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.572
Agent Sinclair,

09:32.640 --> 09:33.741
that's my son Adam.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.742
Is everything all right?

09:34.808 --> 09:35.876
Yeah, everything's fine.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.612
They just have some questions
about a guy that I knew

09:38.679 --> 09:39.880
a very long time ago.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.915
Well, do you want to talk
to the foreman or...?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.350
No, no. You can handle it.
I'll be right there.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.987
My son.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.456
Smart kid.
He's got a business degree.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.660
Me-- I studied sociology.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.863
Mr. Bennett, if you think
of anything

09:55.929 --> 09:58.832
or if you hear from anyone,
give us a call.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.304
DON:
Hey, Tom.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.773
Hi.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.174
Some of my
old files.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.742
I'm going through
and annotating them.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.143
Look, I got to tell you,

10:10.210 --> 10:11.745
we really appreciate
all you're doing.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.880
Somewhere in me,

10:12.946 --> 10:15.215
I still think of this
as my case.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.950
Yeah. I understand.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.152
I mean, they get
under your skin, huh?

10:19.219 --> 10:23.023
Then maybe you'll understand
if I speak to you frankly

10:23.090 --> 10:24.357
about something.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.826
Yeah, sure.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.199
Are you sure
you're the right guy

10:32.265 --> 10:34.367
to be heading up
this investigation?

10:34.434 --> 10:37.070
You read my father's file.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.306
I thought
your name sounded familiar.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.841
Checked up on him.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.509
Your father was
a leader, Eppes.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.811
He organized radical

10:43.877 --> 10:46.446
activities,
and he knew Matt Stirling.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.916
I just want to be sure

10:48.982 --> 10:51.384
that we're all
in the same team here.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.523
We just got the prelim
on the bomb.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.291
Looks like
a non-industrial grade

10:58.358 --> 10:59.426
nitroglycerin.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.427
It's probably homemade.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.530
Back to basics-- sulfuric
and nitric acid, glycerin,

11:03.596 --> 11:06.066
sodium carbonate.
Sawdust was the stabilizer.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.667
Were there any
signature elements?

11:07.735 --> 11:09.202
Yeah, there was one.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.072
The sodium carbonate was sodium
carbonate decahydrate.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.074
In other words, baking soda.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.844
Stirling's bomb...
to the letter.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.547
WOMAN:
Why are you asking me

11:20.613 --> 11:22.615
about Matt Stirling?

11:22.682 --> 11:23.717
Because you were
closely affiliated

11:23.784 --> 11:25.085
during the antiwar
movement,

11:25.152 --> 11:28.688
and we had a bombing
at a recruitment center

11:28.756 --> 11:29.890
on the anniversary
of the bombing

11:29.957 --> 11:31.925
at the ROTC center in '71.

11:32.793 --> 11:33.727
Right.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.628
I remember.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.697
The FBI blamed
that one on Matty.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.699
You think he's come back

11:39.767 --> 11:41.101
after 35 years
to do it again?

11:41.168 --> 11:43.370
We haven't come
to any conclusions yet.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.637
Sounds like
you have.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.839
But you don't really know

11:45.906 --> 11:48.108
anything about
the ROTC bombing, do you?

11:48.175 --> 11:51.511
I know that two young men
were killed in the explosion.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.047
And 18-year-old boys were used
as cannon fodder

11:54.114 --> 11:56.583
in a war we had
no business fighting.

11:56.649 --> 11:57.550
Do you have any information

11:57.617 --> 11:59.319
on Mathew Stirling's
current whereabouts?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.922
None.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.457
Would you tell me if you did?

12:04.524 --> 12:08.461
That's the same question
they asked me in 1971.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.130
And what was your answer?

12:10.197 --> 12:12.032
Over 2,000 troops are dead
in Iraq.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.233
That's not an answer.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.267
The point is,

12:14.334 --> 12:17.938
the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.242
WOMAN: Nearly 35
years later,

12:22.309 --> 12:25.145
you're still chasing
the wrong man.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.679
Mom, please,
maybe they have

12:26.746 --> 12:27.747
something they
can tell us.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.749
Trust me,
they don't.

12:29.817 --> 12:30.750
You don't know that.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.285
Do either of you
know where he is?

12:32.352 --> 12:33.320
MOTHER: We haven't
seen him

12:33.386 --> 12:34.788
since the day
he disappeared.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.825
You people hounded him,
and threatened him

12:37.891 --> 12:39.827
with jail.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.294
Forced a loving
husband and father

12:41.361 --> 12:43.430
to leave his family,
or face prison

12:43.496 --> 12:45.698
for a crime
he didn't commit.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.968
If he was innocent, why didn't
he stay and defend himself?

12:48.035 --> 12:49.636
You were going to railroad him.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.171
The government wanted

12:51.238 --> 12:53.173
to discredit
the peace effort,

12:53.240 --> 12:56.243
what better way than indict
a local leader for murder.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.778
The "effort," as you called it,
was riddled with terrorists,

12:58.846 --> 13:00.480
people who hated
this country.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.781
DON:
Look, there was a bombing

13:01.849 --> 13:03.550
at an Army recruiting office
recently.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.784
You know anything about that?

13:04.852 --> 13:07.054
Of course not.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.089
Have you had any contact
with your husband

13:09.156 --> 13:10.858
-since his disappearance?
-No.

13:12.659 --> 13:13.994
You realize he's probably
married again.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.562
-( disgusted sigh )
-New wife, kids,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.064
Probably has got
some nice house

13:17.130 --> 13:18.265
in the suburbs
somewhere--

13:18.331 --> 13:18.866
Tom.

13:18.932 --> 13:19.900
Tom, Tom, Tom.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.368
My mother filed a
missing persons report.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.970
Nobody ever did
anything about it.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.838
-Okay. -What if something
happened to him?

13:24.905 --> 13:27.875
What if he was hurt?
What if he needed help?

13:27.941 --> 13:30.878
I want you... to leave.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.545
-All right!. -Now. Both of you.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.114
Get out of my house.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.223
Agent Lawson?

13:43.290 --> 13:44.024
Hi.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.225
I'm here looking
for my brother,

13:45.292 --> 13:46.826
they said he might
be with you.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.328
Nah, he just left.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.864
We're taking a little break
from each other.

13:50.931 --> 13:51.965
A little disagreement

13:52.032 --> 13:55.202
over methods employed
in this investigation.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.905
-I can relate to that.
-Yeah.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.540
My day, witness
refused to cooperate,

14:00.607 --> 14:01.608
we didn't coddle them.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.676
My brother coddled someone.

14:03.743 --> 14:04.711
You sure we're talking about

14:04.777 --> 14:06.846
Don Eppes here, right?

14:06.914 --> 14:09.416
You know, you have
a lot of data here.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.985
I investigated
Californians for Peace

14:12.052 --> 14:15.989
and violent protest groups
for five years.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.157
A lot of data.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.725
That's actually
what I'm trying to verify

14:18.791 --> 14:19.993
through social network analysis.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.795
See... you know
when you're getting old.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.297
I never heard of that.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.798
Humans form
social networks--

14:25.865 --> 14:29.069
from bridge clubs and
church groups, to universities

14:29.136 --> 14:31.638
and federal agencies.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.641
Mathematically, we can analyze
these organizational structures

14:34.707 --> 14:37.010
to reveal who
the true leaders are.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.746
Now, these various
antiwar groups in 1971

14:39.812 --> 14:41.581
were also
social networks.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.084
Now, using bipartite
network analysis,

14:44.151 --> 14:46.619
I can identify
who the true connectors are.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.156
See, in my day, we, uh...

14:49.222 --> 14:52.993
we didn't work much
with college professors.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.163
We didn't think
we could trust 'em.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.365
I have National Security
clearance.

14:59.832 --> 15:00.968
Well...

15:01.034 --> 15:02.535
here's to you.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.108
So what happened to your
social network analysis?

15:08.175 --> 15:09.309
CHARLIE:
I'm still working on it.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.479
But this e-mail the FBI received
promises more violence,

15:12.545 --> 15:14.781
and Don would like me
to analyze past attacks

15:14.847 --> 15:16.316
to see what can be expected.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.451
So, we're working on
recurrence plots.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.053
I mean, hundreds
of these events happened,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.321
many happened here at CalSci.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.690
Oh, the school had
defense contracts back then.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.892
I mean, there were
antiwar demonstrations

15:25.959 --> 15:27.794
-right here on campus.
-Bad news is,

15:27.860 --> 15:30.197
three of those 12 events
rank high

15:30.263 --> 15:32.132
-as possible repeats.
-Really?

15:32.199 --> 15:33.200
Two were vandalisms

15:33.266 --> 15:35.602
that destroyed research
for defense work,

15:35.668 --> 15:37.870
and the third was a fire
that damaged a sculpture

15:37.937 --> 15:39.472
right out in front
of this building.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.809
And they all happened
around this time in 1971.

15:42.875 --> 15:43.810
LARRY:
1971.

15:43.876 --> 15:47.080
You know, all these things
were in the headlines:

15:47.147 --> 15:48.615
Pentagon Papers,
My Lai Massacre,

15:48.681 --> 15:50.083
Charles Manson murders.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.619
Do you have any idea
how little press

15:52.685 --> 15:54.854
the Apollo 15mission
was getting?

15:54.921 --> 15:57.757
I need more current data.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.259
LARRY:
You do have a problem.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.062
You have one
single recent event

16:02.129 --> 16:04.431
with which to base
your comparisons.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.933
Which means that you need
more bombings.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.068
That's right.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.037
The constant quandary
of crime analyses:

16:10.103 --> 16:12.772
to get more data,
you need more crimes.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.174
( clamoring )

16:21.314 --> 16:23.516
CHARLIE: Oh, my God,
they hit it again.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.453
This same globe that
was burned in 1971.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.621
Well, now you
have more data.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.665
DON: So the fire at CalSci
does in fact match a fire

16:38.731 --> 16:39.799
that FBI linked to Stirling.

16:39.866 --> 16:40.800
Linked it to him,

16:40.867 --> 16:42.369
because he was
the one that set it.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.936
We have an e-mail
claiming responsibility

16:44.003 --> 16:46.806
identical to a note
nailed to a tree back in 1971.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.342
Reads, "There can be no peace
for the masters of war."

16:49.409 --> 16:51.478
LAWSON: That's a reference
to a Bob Dylan song.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.247
Stirling used
politics as an excuse.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.749
Now with the antiwar
movement revived,

16:56.816 --> 16:57.817
he's back in his element.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.086
Based on
the evidence,

16:59.152 --> 17:01.221
we're not letting go
of the possibility

17:01.288 --> 17:02.689
that it was
a copycat.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.257
The sculpture burned due to
a creosote-based substance

17:04.324 --> 17:05.225
that somebody put on it.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.227
There's only about a dozen
places in the area

17:07.294 --> 17:08.561
where you can buy it.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.530
All right, so why don't you
get a list of recent buyers,

17:10.597 --> 17:11.631
run that against anyone
who bought chemicals

17:11.698 --> 17:12.632
used in the recruitment
office bombing.

17:12.699 --> 17:16.236
LAWSON:Wait a minute,
we've got a match.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.870
The language in the letters.

17:17.937 --> 17:18.971
The construction of the bomb.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.773
The sculpture.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.110
We need to quit chasing around
and drag in

17:23.176 --> 17:24.977
Stirling's wife,
his daughter.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.313
anybody he's
associated with.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.381
These people all have careers;
they got mortgages.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.949
Believe me,
they'll talk to us.

17:30.016 --> 17:30.950
Well, I disagree.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.520
And I think our best shot
is following the leads

17:33.586 --> 17:34.321
from today, Tom,

17:34.387 --> 17:36.323
not from
35 years ago.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.391
All right,
guys, let's just

17:38.458 --> 17:39.726
continue with what we're doing.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.432
This is exactly
what I was worried about.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.634
Pardon me?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.769
Divided loyalties.

17:52.839 --> 17:53.773
"Subject is active
in groups

17:53.840 --> 17:55.708
"associated with the overthrow
of the U.S. government,

17:55.775 --> 17:59.011
violent political unrest
and social agitation."

17:59.078 --> 18:00.079
Uh-huh.
And your point?

18:00.147 --> 18:01.681
Your commitment
to this investigation.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.016
Your father knew Stirling,
he worked with him...

18:04.083 --> 18:06.619
All right, look, let's just
clear this up right now.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.288
Are you actually
suggesting that my father

18:08.355 --> 18:09.922
had something to do
with these bombings?

18:09.989 --> 18:10.790
Of course not.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.559
But your father knew the people
that Stirling knew.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.827
Your father's
a source of information.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.096
A source which you are choosing
not to use.

18:21.934 --> 18:22.869
( knocks )

18:22.935 --> 18:25.004
Hi. Hi, can I help you?

18:25.071 --> 18:26.606
I'm Laura Stirling.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.975
My father was
Matthew Stirling.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.611
Your brother's working on
a case involving him.

18:31.678 --> 18:35.315
Okay. I cannot discuss
my brother's work.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.049
I did an internet search
on your brother

18:37.116 --> 18:38.218
and I found out
that sometimes

18:38.285 --> 18:40.220
he works with you.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.422
If you have questions,
if you have concerns,

18:42.489 --> 18:44.157
you need to take them
directly to the FBI.

18:44.224 --> 18:48.060
I know, but... my mother's
still angry with the FBI.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.762
She'd never cooperate
with them,

18:49.829 --> 18:51.898
and she wouldn't want me
cooperating with them, either.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.601
If I went to their offices,
she'd never forgive me.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.404
I'm sorry,
then why are you here?

18:59.071 --> 19:00.440
Um...

19:01.441 --> 19:04.076
This hairbrush...

19:04.143 --> 19:06.246
was my father's.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.551
The FBI might be able
to match his DNA.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.390
You understand...

19:17.457 --> 19:20.960
that if they match this
to a crime scene,

19:21.027 --> 19:22.495
it might prove that your father

19:22.562 --> 19:24.497
was involved
in these bombings.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.566
It's a chance
I'm willing to take.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.470
I barely got to know my father.

19:30.537 --> 19:36.243
But if he's proved innocent,
then maybe, finally,

19:36.309 --> 19:37.877
he can come home.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.185
-Hey.
-Charlie's not here.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.855
Actually, I came
to see you.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.392
Dad...

19:52.459 --> 19:54.961
how well did you know
Matt Stirling?

19:56.596 --> 19:57.730
Is this an official visit?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.198
Come on.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.400
How'd you meet him?

20:00.467 --> 20:02.435
At a local church.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.871
I was organizing voters.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.474
You know, we had people
from all walks of life there.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.409
We had students
and teachers...

20:09.476 --> 20:10.677
Dad, Matt Stirling.

20:10.743 --> 20:15.282
Matt Stirling was a lawyer
devoted to non-violent protests.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.083
And he was a
good speaker, too.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.151
That's what got him in trouble
with the FBI.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.453
You see, he could speak
their language.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.821
He could use it against them.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.155
That's it, huh?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.424
Am I a suspect, too?

20:24.491 --> 20:26.359
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.461
It's just that Stirling
got help

20:28.528 --> 20:30.497
from someone, we think, and...

20:31.398 --> 20:33.900
Oh, I see.

20:33.966 --> 20:38.405
And I knew the people he knew...

20:38.471 --> 20:40.707
Credit your mother--
she loved to organize things.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.610
-You know, keep records.
-What's this?

20:43.676 --> 20:46.012
Oh, that's called
a phone tree.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.114
Before e-mail, that's how
we organized things.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.451
Each person was assigned
a list of people to call.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.185
Schedules, committee rosters...

20:53.252 --> 20:54.721
Oh, Dad, this is
definitely going to help.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.823
You know, Donnie, I'd
hate to see anyone

20:56.889 --> 20:58.825
found guilty
by association.

20:58.891 --> 20:59.692
Well, you can trust me.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.060
It's not you
I'm worried about.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.562
Dad, I know a lot of the guys

21:02.629 --> 21:04.196
who were in the Bureau
in the '70s.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.197
These are good people.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.198
I mean, they truly believe

21:06.265 --> 21:07.233
what they were doing
was right, so...

21:07.300 --> 21:09.336
Yeah? So did we.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.037
You read my file,
haven't you?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.072
I mean, all that crap
they have in there about me?

21:13.139 --> 21:14.774
Yeah, I read some of it.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.809
Donnie, they said
that my work

21:16.876 --> 21:18.745
registering voters
in South Central

21:18.811 --> 21:21.080
was part of a conspiracy
to instigate racial tensions.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.349
Now, how can you
defend that?

21:22.415 --> 21:23.616
I don't have to.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.752
I don't see stuff like that
going on today, Dad--

21:25.818 --> 21:27.887
and I see a lot--
things have changed.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.689
-I think you believe that.
-I do believe it.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.425
I'm not sure that I do.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.367
These are Alan Eppes'
records of the group--

21:40.433 --> 21:42.168
names, committees...

21:42.234 --> 21:43.336
Wow.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.071
And these ones are
those sales records

21:45.137 --> 21:47.607
of local chemical companies
from '69 to '71--

21:47.674 --> 21:48.875
everything we could
dig up, anyway.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.810
A lot of them
don't exist anymore.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.279
And I bet a lot of them didn't
use their real names.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.382
That's why we been looking at
the street addresses.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.449
Nothing there.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.485
And they might be stolen.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.919
Maybe the bomber didn't
buy the raw materials.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.888
He had access to them,
through a job or something.

22:01.954 --> 22:05.257
But what kind of companies would
have these materials on hand?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.926
Lots of them
would have one or two,

22:06.993 --> 22:08.695
but the only ones that
actually have all three

22:08.761 --> 22:10.262
of the chemicals are companies

22:10.329 --> 22:11.998
that specifically make
explosives.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.666
DAVID:
The bigger issue is,

22:13.733 --> 22:15.402
most industrial uses
of nitric acid

22:15.468 --> 22:17.069
only require a solution
that's between

22:17.136 --> 22:18.805
52 and 68 percent concentrated.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.673
For nitroglycerin,
you need over 86 percent.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.109
Yeah, but if none of
these people had access

22:23.175 --> 22:24.310
to the chemicals...

22:24.377 --> 22:27.013
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
There's always grain alcohol.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.047
What...?

22:28.114 --> 22:30.249
When we were in college,
my buddies and I would want

22:30.316 --> 22:32.685
to make a grain alcohol punch,
and couldn't get our hands

22:32.752 --> 22:34.487
on some, we talked
to a pre-med student

22:34.554 --> 22:37.356
and see if we could have him
swipe some pure lab alcohol.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.925
DAVID:
Pre-med student.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.768
Here, take a look at...

22:48.835 --> 22:53.573
Look who was pre-med
at UCLA in '71--

22:53.640 --> 22:55.374
Dr. Sarah Kemple.

22:55.442 --> 22:56.709
She knew advanced chemistry.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.711
And she'd have access
to a university lab.

22:58.778 --> 22:59.879
She has
everything.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.648
She has motive,
she has knowledge,

23:01.714 --> 23:03.015
and she has the materials.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.618
Why didn't the Bureau put this
evidence together back then?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.720
Because they were so
focused on Stirling,

23:07.787 --> 23:10.389
they didn't bother
looking at anybody else.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.661
Dr. Kemple?

23:15.828 --> 23:17.930
You need
to come with us.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.967
It's all right.
I'm ready.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.705
I've been waiting 35 years
for you.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.908
Turn around for us.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.413
Let's go.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.420
I was pre-med.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.990
I made the
nitroglycerin myself.

23:44.056 --> 23:47.059
Took what I needed
from the university labs.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.796
The police and the FBI--

23:49.862 --> 23:52.131
they never even questioned me.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.966
And after Matty disappeared,

23:54.033 --> 23:57.604
it was just so easy
to let it end there.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.971
Well, it didn't.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.740
The families of the kids
you killed

24:00.807 --> 24:01.974
couldn't let it end there.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.477
MEGAN: Where were
you the night

24:04.544 --> 24:06.479
of the bombing
at the recruitment center?

24:06.546 --> 24:08.481
At a medical conference
in San Francisco.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.551
I would never have set
another bomb.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.752
Not after what happened.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.654
Do you know
where Matthew Stirling is?

24:14.721 --> 24:16.155
I told you, I have no idea.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.757
He helped you plan
the ROTC bombing?

24:17.824 --> 24:20.760
No, Matty didn't know anything
about it.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.394
Then where did the idea
come from?

24:22.461 --> 24:23.663
There was this one guy

24:23.730 --> 24:25.131
in the group.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.833
We called him Cisco.

24:26.899 --> 24:30.436
I read some stuff
he wrote.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.071
He was charming, passionate.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.973
Cisco was his first
or his last name?

24:34.040 --> 24:34.907
I don't know.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.475
I didn't really know him.

24:36.543 --> 24:37.844
He was Matty's friend.

24:44.917 --> 24:48.054
( voice breaking ):
I'm so very sorry.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.860
-She was covering for Stirling.
-She was pretty specific

24:53.926 --> 24:56.428
about the making of the bomb,
how it was planted...

24:56.495 --> 24:57.564
She was out of town.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.532
She couldn't have done
the second bombing.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.667
How do you explain that?

25:00.733 --> 25:01.668
A copycat. Tom...

25:01.734 --> 25:03.335
Look, I'm telling you,
Stirling put her up

25:03.402 --> 25:06.573
to it in '71, and he's the guy
behind the new ones.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.675
Let me ask you this--
did you ever even look

25:08.741 --> 25:09.709
at anybody else besides him?

25:09.776 --> 25:11.043
Have you ever had a hunch?

25:11.110 --> 25:14.413
Have you ever known deep
in your gut who the bad guy was?

25:14.480 --> 25:15.948
What about Cisco?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.917
You ever hear
of that name?

25:17.984 --> 25:19.151
I had a report.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.286
Yeah, and what happened?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.088
Drifter, outside agitator.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.823
Operated locally
for a few months,

25:23.890 --> 25:26.258
and we never heard anything
more about him.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.426
A nobody.

25:27.493 --> 25:28.861
Well, not to Sarah Kemple.

25:28.928 --> 25:32.264
She claims she got the whole
idea for the bombing from him.

25:32.331 --> 25:35.602
You know, Tom, I've had a few
wrong hunches in my time.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.907
AMITA: This analysis says
which members of this group

25:40.973 --> 25:44.210
got along, and which didn't,
and who linked up with people

25:44.276 --> 25:45.377
in other antiwar groups.

25:45.444 --> 25:47.980
Boy, you know,
people don't like to think

25:48.047 --> 25:50.683
that their lives can be
tracked so accurately, but, uh,

25:50.750 --> 25:51.851
human action
isn't very different

25:51.918 --> 25:53.185
than any other data, is it?

25:53.252 --> 25:57.189
Network analysis
quantifies relationships.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.858
It reveals substructures
in networks,

25:58.925 --> 26:03.863
like cliques, romances,

26:03.930 --> 26:05.998
even secret alliances.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.868
However, there's something
odd here.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.870
What?

26:10.937 --> 26:12.204
Matt Stirling was a connector

26:12.271 --> 26:14.741
between Californians for Peace
and another group,

26:14.807 --> 26:17.276
but that group
wasn't the Weather Underground.

26:17.343 --> 26:21.981
My SNA graph indicates
that that group was the FBI.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.515
How can that be?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.551
The FBI's investigation
into the group.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.053
I mean, there are dates here.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.421
Key steps into
the investigation

26:29.488 --> 26:31.691
which coincide with
the activities of this subset.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.493
Only, look,
they predate the events.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.028
But that means the the FBI

26:36.095 --> 26:37.764
wasn't just investigating
this group.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.833
It was somehow inside it.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.072
DON:
We now know unequivocally

26:46.138 --> 26:48.641
that your husband
wasn't responsible

26:48.708 --> 26:50.643
for the ROTC bombing.

26:50.710 --> 26:54.113
It was a woman...
named Sarah Kemple.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.347
Sarah?!

26:55.414 --> 26:57.516
Yeah.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.652
I told you people

26:59.719 --> 27:01.087
Matty wasn't capable
of hurting anyone.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.657
Well, can you tell me if you've
ever heard of a man named Cisco?

27:04.724 --> 27:06.158
Are you actually
asking for my help?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.360
Yes, Mrs. Stirling,
I'm asking for your help, okay?

27:08.427 --> 27:09.295
A man died on Sunday.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.397
I got two letters
promising more of the same.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.866
These are innocent people
we're talking about here.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.267
Cisco-- I never met him.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.568
But you heard of him?

27:16.635 --> 27:19.005
Matty was afraid of him.

27:19.071 --> 27:22.041
Afraid of how far he might go.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.811
But I told the FBI all of this.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.145
But they wouldn't listen.

27:26.212 --> 27:29.481
All right, well,
I'm listening now.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.217
All I know is,

27:31.283 --> 27:33.753
the night
that Matty disappeared,

27:33.820 --> 27:35.087
he was scared.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.188
Of what?

27:36.255 --> 27:37.356
I don't know.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.791
But because of it...

27:38.858 --> 27:40.426
( sighs )

27:40.492 --> 27:41.794
I've always thought that

27:41.861 --> 27:43.262
something must have happened
to him.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.732
Only the FBI decided
that he was a fugitive.

27:45.798 --> 27:46.866
All right.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.300
And that was that.

27:51.938 --> 27:54.540
Again, I'm sorry,

27:54.606 --> 27:56.743
and I appreciate
you talking to me.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.946
Thanks.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.314
( sighs )

28:02.381 --> 28:05.317
CHARLIE: Now, this seems
very strange to me,

28:05.384 --> 28:08.888
although the analysis
is fairly definitive.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.522
We've analyzed
patterns of meetings,

28:10.589 --> 28:13.793
groupings, actions, and
we're seeing correlations

28:13.860 --> 28:16.729
with the FBI's investigation
into this group.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.297
What type of correlations?

28:18.364 --> 28:20.299
It seems decisions that
were made by the Bureau

28:20.366 --> 28:23.069
predate related activities
by the protest group.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.971
So, I mean,
it's almost as if

28:25.037 --> 28:27.006
Californians for Peace
and the Bureau

28:27.073 --> 28:28.474
were overlapping
organizations.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.143
I mean, that's not
possible, is it?

28:31.210 --> 28:36.615
Suddenly a lot about this
case seems more possible.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.150
Who was Cisco?

28:38.217 --> 28:41.053
I told you,
he was a drifter.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.554
I think he was
an undercover agent

28:42.621 --> 28:44.623
-who you put inside.
-Those records are sealed.

28:44.690 --> 28:47.359
In order to get at them, you'd
need a special court order,

28:47.426 --> 28:49.128
and I think
I still got enough juice

28:49.195 --> 28:50.529
to keep you from doing that.

28:50.596 --> 28:51.463
Why didn't you say something?

28:51.530 --> 28:54.033
I told you, Sarah Kemple said
Cisco was the one

28:54.100 --> 28:55.768
that convinced her
to plant the bomb.

28:55.835 --> 28:56.936
Nonsense.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.038
All right, fine; let's go
talk to her-- come on.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.439
I don't need
to talk to her.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.909
What is your problem?
I mean, I can't figure you out.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.676
Why are you such an ass?

29:04.743 --> 29:07.379
I don't need to talk
to Sarah Kemple,

29:07.446 --> 29:11.717
because she never ever spoke
to Cisco.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.719
So, you knew about him
all along.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.989
So, who else did he talk to?

29:17.056 --> 29:19.191
Cisco's contact was Stirling.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.093
What, that's the only person
he spoke to?

29:21.160 --> 29:23.762
-How are you so sure about that?
-I'm certain of it.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.464
Well, I want
to talk to him.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.366
You just did.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.968
I was Cisco.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.878
LAWSON:
I was operating under orders.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.913
We believed that Stirling
and his group

29:40.980 --> 29:42.949
-were capable of violence.
-DON: Based on what?

29:43.015 --> 29:44.283
See, that's the thing
I'm not clear about.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.818
It was the consensus
at the time.

29:45.885 --> 29:46.953
Maybe you had to be there.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.088
That's not good enough, Tom.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.891
You said your undercover work
was mostly with Stirling, right?

29:51.958 --> 29:54.626
I met him at a protest march,
got to know him.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.162
We talked about the role

29:56.228 --> 29:57.529
of violence in
the movement.

29:57.596 --> 29:58.664
Who brought it up?

29:58.730 --> 30:00.499
I did. I was instructed to.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.935
DAVID: Did you give anyone
in Stirling's group

30:03.002 --> 30:04.770
instructions on bomb-making?

30:04.837 --> 30:06.305
We talked about
what kind of chemicals

30:06.372 --> 30:08.207
were readily available;
we talked about

30:08.274 --> 30:09.909
the chemical processes
one could use.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.643
DAVID:
Did you provide

30:11.710 --> 30:13.279
any materials?

30:13.345 --> 30:14.213
No.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.447
Was there even
the slightest concern

30:15.514 --> 30:17.249
that innocent people
could get hurt?

30:17.316 --> 30:20.987
We followed Stirling
day and night for months.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.354
This guy was a lawyer.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.456
In order to nail him,
we had to catch him

30:24.523 --> 30:26.792
in the act,
which I would have done,

30:26.859 --> 30:28.327
except the press got involved.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.997
Somebody blew the whistle, there
was an article in the Times,

30:31.063 --> 30:33.032
and then I was ordered
off undercover.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.334
Two months later,
the ROTC was bombed.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.103
Which is
when Stirling disappeared.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.804
Fled from prosecution.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.206
You still think
he's the bomber.

30:40.272 --> 30:43.742
Maybe he put Kemple
up to it, but

30:43.809 --> 30:45.111
he's involved.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.245
You realize, without you,

30:46.312 --> 30:48.480
there might not even have been
an ROTC bombing?

30:48.547 --> 30:52.351
A person doesn't become violent
because you talk to him, Eppes.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.686
You're either
a terrorist

30:54.753 --> 30:57.156
or you're not.

30:59.691 --> 31:03.295
Something's been bothering me
about Sarah Kemple's bomb.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.696
What's that?

31:04.763 --> 31:06.365
These are her records
from UCLA.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.467
The quantity of chemicals
that was stolen from there

31:08.534 --> 31:11.103
was enough to make about three
times the amount of explosives

31:11.170 --> 31:14.573
that were used in the bombing
at the ROTC center in '71.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.975
You're right.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.910
So what happened
to the rest of it?

31:30.322 --> 31:34.893
( people shouting )

31:34.961 --> 31:37.129
DAVID: We got lucky--
no major injuries.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.664
Well, it's the first
bit of luck

31:38.730 --> 31:40.132
we've had on this thing.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.901
Prelim on the bomb indicates
it's the same composition

31:42.969 --> 31:44.770
as the one used on the
recruitment office.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.438
You know we got
another e-mail.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.475
Yeah. Similar wording,
more attacks to come.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.276
Blah, blah, blah.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.410
Here's the kicker.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.980
Just came in from the
Bomb Data Center in D.C.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.547
Confirms our
initial thoughts.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.117
These explosives have the
same chemical signature

31:58.184 --> 32:00.019
as the '71 ROTC bomb.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.487
So you tell me
how two people,

32:01.553 --> 32:03.956
35 years apart,
use the same process.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.024
Not likely.

32:05.091 --> 32:07.526
Don, they use the
same exact process.

32:07.593 --> 32:08.894
Same amounts, both used

32:08.961 --> 32:10.429
a commercially available
sodium carbonate--

32:10.496 --> 32:11.430
baking soda.

32:11.497 --> 32:12.965
Yeah, we know
it ain't Sarah Kemple.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.833
Someone else
has his formula.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.102
Definitely, definitely.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.871
You said you figured out the
formula for the bomb yourself.

32:19.938 --> 32:20.906
That's right.

32:20.973 --> 32:21.907
I did.

32:21.974 --> 32:22.841
That's not
gonna fly, Sarah.

32:22.908 --> 32:26.045
Someone else is using the same
process to make new bombs.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.646
That's impossible.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.381
You're a doctor.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.350
You know that lab reports
don't lie.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.452
Someone else
had to be aware

32:33.519 --> 32:35.721
of the chemical mix
that you used.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.925
The book.

32:39.992 --> 32:42.094
What book?

32:42.161 --> 32:44.230
It was a copy
of Essays on Revolution.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.665
The formula was written
on the flyleaf.

32:46.732 --> 32:47.466
I assumed it
was Matty's.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.734
But later, when I
asked him about it,

32:48.800 --> 32:51.603
he didn't seem to know
what I was talking about.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.939
Where's the book now?

32:54.006 --> 32:55.941
( sighs )

32:56.008 --> 32:57.143
I don't know.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.478
I haven't seen it
for 35 years.

32:59.545 --> 33:02.381
And where are the rest
of the explosives?

33:02.448 --> 33:04.883
I know you had more than
you used at the ROTC bombing.

33:04.950 --> 33:09.155
I hid them in a shed behind a
weekend place my parents owned.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.823
A few weeks later, I
went back to get them.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.892
But they were gone.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.194
They were gone.

33:15.261 --> 33:16.995
And who else knew
they were there?

33:18.897 --> 33:19.931
Matty was the only one.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.734
HESTER: I've shown you every
book in the house.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.704
I have never owned a copy
of "Essays on Revolution."

33:25.771 --> 33:27.906
Okay, how about
your husband?

33:27.973 --> 33:28.974
I don't know.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.242
We cleaned out
his office.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.610
I gave most of
his stuff away.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.112
What's so important
about this book?

33:33.179 --> 33:34.846
Well, we believe
that it contained

33:34.913 --> 33:37.616
the chemical signatures
for the explosives used in,

33:37.683 --> 33:40.652
not only the '71 bombing,
but the one the other night.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.255
-The chemical signatures?
-Exactly.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.491
Mrs. Stirling, has your husband
ever mentioned anything

33:45.557 --> 33:47.593
about explosives
he may have come across?

33:47.659 --> 33:50.462
No, but if Matty had, he
certainly wouldn't have

33:50.529 --> 33:53.532
brought them in the house and
exposed his family to danger.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.734
And the night he disappeared,
you told the FBI he said

33:55.801 --> 33:59.037
he was leaving to prevent a,
quote, "terrible mistake."

33:59.105 --> 34:01.107
That's what he said.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.808
Excuse me.

34:02.874 --> 34:03.742
COLBY:
Swept the house.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.712
There's no sign of any book;
no explosives.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.747
Sarah Kemple said Stirling
was the only one

34:08.814 --> 34:10.048
who knew about the explosives.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.350
30 years-- could
be anywhere.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.552
He said he was trying
to prevent a mistake.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.421
Which, at the time,
the FBI assumed

34:15.487 --> 34:16.455
meant him being arrested.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.724
So what if he was trying
to stop Sarah Kemple

34:18.790 --> 34:20.259
from making another bomb?

34:20.326 --> 34:22.661
You think he was going
after the explosives?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.763
Sarah said, by the time
she got back here,

34:24.830 --> 34:25.797
the explosives were gone.

34:25.864 --> 34:29.468
Yeah, but how's he gonna
move nitro without...

34:29.535 --> 34:33.071
Wait... so if he's out to stop
Kemple and he never leaves L.A.,

34:33.139 --> 34:34.273
we should be looking
at routes

34:34.340 --> 34:35.974
he would have taken
out of here, right?

34:36.041 --> 34:38.377
I just found a bunch
of my old maps,

34:38.444 --> 34:42.948
which should show us what
roads were not around in 1971.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.783
Terrific.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.352
AMITA:
I ran a preliminary analysis

34:46.418 --> 34:47.753
to find the most likely route

34:47.819 --> 34:50.021
between Stirling's home
and his destination.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.056
You rock.

34:51.123 --> 34:53.325
Okay, so we take
this information,

34:53.392 --> 34:54.626
we run it against that map,

34:54.693 --> 34:56.862
which shows areas
of dense vegetation...

34:56.928 --> 34:59.531
The result should be
a short list of places

34:59.598 --> 35:02.501
to find a man hidden
in plain sight.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.804
COLBY:
Yeah, there's a wreck down here.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.239
It's an old Volkswagen.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.740
Can you tell
what color it is?

35:08.807 --> 35:10.376
Yeah, it's yellow.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.278
A lot of damage, though.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.545
That's Stirling's car.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.080
I'm gonna come down
and take a look.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.549
COLBY:
Okay.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.035
Oh, yeah.

35:37.102 --> 35:39.705
We got a human skull!

35:42.574 --> 35:44.142
DAVID:
Looks like the damage came from

35:44.210 --> 35:45.611
the explosion inside the car.

35:45.677 --> 35:48.079
I'd say he was driving
away from the cabin, right?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.781
DAVID: That nitro was
pretty unstable.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.883
So he's got a trunk
loaded with this stuff,

35:51.950 --> 35:53.752
and then he hits a pothole.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.722
That means all the explosive
material from '71 is gone.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.157
And with Stirling dead,
that effectively eliminates him

35:59.225 --> 36:01.427
as a suspect
in the current bombings.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.662
MEGAN: Yeah, but our current
bomber is using the same recipe

36:03.729 --> 36:06.798
and the same wording in all the
letters claiming responsibility.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.967
We got a copycat
who got ahold of that book.

36:09.034 --> 36:12.070
COLBY: The Revolution book's not
at Hester Sterling's house,

36:12.137 --> 36:14.706
and it's not at Dr. Kemple's
home or her office.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.275
All right, well, what about
Stirling's daughter?

36:16.342 --> 36:17.643
-She's got a place, right?
-Yeah.

36:17.709 --> 36:18.610
So check that out.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.412
Bank records on that protest
group finally came through.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.581
That American Peace Movement?

36:22.648 --> 36:24.816
Guess who donated $1,000
last year?

36:24.883 --> 36:25.884
Jack Bennett?

36:25.951 --> 36:27.919
GOP poster boy.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.528
Give money? Me?

36:36.595 --> 36:38.964
To a bunch of radical nutcases
like that?

36:39.030 --> 36:40.432
-No way.
-You used to be

36:40.499 --> 36:42.334
a radical nutcase yourself.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.335
I learned my lesson.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.636
I believe in this country.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.705
I'm not looking
to tear it down.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.740
That's your company's name,
isn't it?

36:48.807 --> 36:51.042
Yeah, but that's
got to be a forgery.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.043
Look, you can check

36:52.110 --> 36:53.044
my handwriting, right?

36:53.111 --> 36:54.380
You have experts
who can do that?

36:54.446 --> 36:56.047
Yeah, we got armies of them.

36:56.114 --> 36:57.349
'Cause I'm telling you,

36:57.416 --> 36:58.450
I would not
give money

36:58.517 --> 37:00.752
to an organization like that.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.089
What about his company?

37:04.155 --> 37:05.591
If they use explosives,

37:05.657 --> 37:07.593
we might be able
to tie the bombings to him.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.928
Bennett hires a contractor
for demolition work.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.797
And those would be
commercially made explosives.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.199
Yeah, and our bomber's
making his own.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.868
Basic chemicals, we might
be able to tie them to him.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.604
CHARLIE: Yeah, they'll need
more than ingredients.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.339
They'll need a knowledge
of chemistry.

37:20.406 --> 37:21.373
DAVID:
No luck.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.642
Bennett flunked
high school chemistry.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.877
There's three invoices
in this file.

37:25.944 --> 37:29.114
Bennett's company from
a chemical wholesaler.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.683
One of them's for sulfuric acid,
one's for nitric acid,

37:31.750 --> 37:33.218
and the third one
is for glycerin.

37:33.285 --> 37:34.620
Let me see
those checks again.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.991
Think he's right
about the forgery

37:40.058 --> 37:41.393
of his signature
on these checks.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.329
This handwriting
doesn't match.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.063
All right, so what
are we missing here?

37:45.130 --> 37:46.965
What are we missing?

37:47.032 --> 37:49.835
We're missing a dimension.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.103
Hey, check this out.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.772
Okay, figure this

37:53.839 --> 37:56.842
is our antiwar group,
just this, in 1971.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.243
Now, we can analyze

37:58.310 --> 38:00.546
the various connections
and patterns

38:00.612 --> 38:03.982
for just this social group,

38:04.049 --> 38:06.985
for just that year,
but see,

38:07.052 --> 38:10.322
time creates new connections,

38:10.389 --> 38:14.793
the offspring
of the old network.

38:14.860 --> 38:18.129
So we're looking
at the wrong generation?

38:18.196 --> 38:19.531
Are you out of your minds?

38:19.598 --> 38:20.932
-I'm a Republican!
-Hold on a second.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.434
Just relax-- we're
not here for you...

38:22.501 --> 38:23.835
MEGAN:
We're here for your son.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.204
My son? All right,
this has gone far enough.

38:26.271 --> 38:28.407
He's the one who forged
your name to buy chemicals

38:28.474 --> 38:29.741
so he could make nitro...

38:29.808 --> 38:31.209
No, I know my son!
This is absurd!

38:31.276 --> 38:32.310
You can search my home.

38:32.378 --> 38:33.845
You will not find anything!

38:33.912 --> 38:36.682
-Actually, they will!
-Hey!

38:36.748 --> 38:38.384
DAVID:
He's got blasting gelatin,

38:38.450 --> 38:39.418
made with nitroglycerin.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.619
That's right.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.153
And it's lot more powerful
than dynamite.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.889
Shoot me and find out.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.557
Clear the area-- everyone
with a hard hat, step back!

38:45.624 --> 38:47.559
Get outta here!
Back off!

38:47.626 --> 38:48.560
Adam, for God's
sake, please.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.695
ADAM:
What happened to you?

38:49.761 --> 38:51.497
You used to believe
in something.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.498
Now innocent kids
are dying,

38:52.564 --> 38:54.065
and all you can do
is keep voting

38:54.132 --> 38:57.102
the same guys back to office
who send them off to war.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.169
This is not an answer.

38:58.236 --> 38:59.170
It worked once.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.006
BENNETT:
The war went on for years!

39:01.072 --> 39:03.041
Not this war, Dad,
not while I can still do...

39:22.060 --> 39:24.463
Guess you do know

39:24.530 --> 39:25.964
a little
about explosives, huh?

39:26.031 --> 39:27.298
Yeah, that's right.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.801
like blasting gel is a lot
more powerful than dynamite,

39:29.868 --> 39:31.937
but it's a lot more stable, too.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.544
MEGAN:
Where did you get this?

39:40.946 --> 39:43.014
( sighs )

39:43.081 --> 39:46.418
It was in a box of things
that belonged to my dad...

39:46.485 --> 39:48.854
back when he was an activist.

39:48.920 --> 39:53.291
Actually, it doesn't belong
to your father.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.126
It belonged
to someone else.

39:59.965 --> 40:03.034
I don't know, Tom.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.704
I'm having a hard time
getting my head around the fact

40:05.771 --> 40:07.506
that you guys started
a chain reaction

40:07.573 --> 40:09.107
that lasted through two wars.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.241
Had no choice.

40:10.308 --> 40:11.510
We had to be proactive.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.178
Three people are dead.

40:13.244 --> 40:17.549
And how many more are alive
because of what we do?

40:18.584 --> 40:22.053
The formula for the bombs
are in here.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.089
Is it your handwriting
in the margins?

40:28.794 --> 40:32.197
We had to stop these people
from killing Americans.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.600
When that happens, no
one cares how you do it.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.002
Terrorists,
bottom line.

40:37.068 --> 40:40.672
Our job is to protect,
by any means.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.140
I don't know about that, Tom.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.976
At a certain point, there's
a cost-- there's got to be.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.479
You know,
that's the kind of thing

40:47.546 --> 40:49.114
that gives us a bad name
around the world,

40:49.180 --> 40:52.017
and it comes back to haunt us...
just like it did.

40:53.752 --> 40:57.455
Just like it did.

40:57.523 --> 40:59.024
It seems
that your father died

40:59.090 --> 41:03.662
while attempting
to do a very good thing.

41:03.729 --> 41:06.197
I'm not sure if knowing that
helps at all.

41:06.264 --> 41:09.034
No, it does
help, a lot.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.970
I guess I probably knew
my father was dead,

41:12.037 --> 41:14.439
but what I really couldn't face

41:14.506 --> 41:16.575
would have been
if he was guilty.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.344
You know, my father
was a peace activist,

41:19.410 --> 41:21.780
and he knew your father.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.650
He says that your father
was a man committed

41:24.716 --> 41:26.117
to helping people.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.986
And he never believed

41:28.053 --> 41:30.321
the charges against your father
were true.

41:30.388 --> 41:32.924
Mm. That's good to hear.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.995
Finally, after all these years,

41:37.062 --> 41:39.130
we're going to have
a memorial service.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.332
Maybe your father
would like to come

41:41.399 --> 41:45.036
and you, too, if you want.

41:45.103 --> 41:48.607
I think my father and I
would like that very much.

41:48.674 --> 41:51.543
( softly ):
Good.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.381
Dad?

41:56.447 --> 41:59.050
Hi.

41:59.117 --> 42:01.987
Charlie did a good job
on this, huh?

42:02.053 --> 42:04.355
Yeah, I like it.

42:04.422 --> 42:07.893
Look, you know, I'm aware

42:07.959 --> 42:10.361
that the Bureau has
some bad history.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.463
Is that an apology?

42:12.530 --> 42:15.601
I'm just saying, it was
a different time, you know?

42:15.667 --> 42:16.902
And I know that.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.504
Donnie, I'm the same guy
I was then.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.740
I still believe
in the same things.

42:21.807 --> 42:23.274
Yeah, well, good.

42:25.510 --> 42:27.145
( sighs )

42:27.212 --> 42:29.948
You know, when you told me
you were going to join the FBI,

42:30.015 --> 42:32.250
you know what the first thought
I had was?

42:32.317 --> 42:34.119
"Where did I go wrong?"

42:34.185 --> 42:35.987
Honestly, yes.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.956
Because I thought
you wanted

42:38.023 --> 42:39.758
to do something as
different from Charlie

42:39.825 --> 42:41.159
and the rest of
us as possible.

42:41.226 --> 42:45.030
No, I knew it was something
I was going to be good at.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.197
And you are.

42:46.264 --> 42:48.166
-Yeah.
-No, I mean it.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.801
You are, Donnie.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.703
Maybe it's because
your mother and I

42:51.770 --> 42:54.572
brought you guys up
to do the kind of work

42:54.640 --> 42:56.041
that really matters
in this world.

42:58.009 --> 43:02.013
DON: And, you know, look,
I didn't have to read

43:02.080 --> 43:03.381
the file, okay?

43:03.448 --> 43:04.950
'Cause I knew that, ultimately,

43:05.016 --> 43:08.754
I would respect anything that
you or Mom were involved with.

43:13.358 --> 43:14.960
Commie.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.427
G-Man.

43:16.494 --> 43:17.963
( laughs )

43:18.029 --> 43:19.597
All right, big shot,
where are you

43:19.665 --> 43:20.365
gonna take me to dinner?

43:20.431 --> 43:22.100
All right, well,
there's a new Italian place

43:22.167 --> 43:23.702
that supposed to have great
steak pizzaiola.

43:23.769 --> 43:24.836
Red meat, let's eat.

43:24.903 --> 43:26.638
ALAN:
Hey, at least it's good to know,

43:26.705 --> 43:28.306
when it comes to food you're
still both your father's sons.
