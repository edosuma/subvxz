00:00.400 --> 00:02.540
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.540 --> 00:04.550
Hello. I'm Sheldon Cooper,
and this is

00:04.550 --> 00:07.630
"Why Sheldon Cooper Should
Go to College."

00:07.630 --> 00:09.460
Which is why I'm proposing
that I live at home

00:09.460 --> 00:12.170
but enroll full-time
to continue my studies

00:12.170 --> 00:14.760
with Dr. Sturgis
at East Texas Tech.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.510
Hi, Mary.

00:16.510 --> 00:19.890
I know this must be
a hard decision for you,

00:19.890 --> 00:22.180
but if you let him come here,

00:22.180 --> 00:25.940
I promise we'll take
good care of him.

00:26.730 --> 00:29.820
Sheldon Cooper:
ready for college,

00:29.820 --> 00:31.360
ready to change the world.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.490
GEORGE SR.:
Cut.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.030
If that doesn't convince her,

00:34.030 --> 00:36.070
I don't know
what her problem is.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.660
♪ ♪

00:41.620 --> 00:43.460
I'm excited to finally use
college-ruled paper

00:43.460 --> 00:45.330
and not feel like
I'm living a lie.

00:45.330 --> 00:47.130
What's college-ruled paper?

00:47.130 --> 00:49.380
The lines are
18% closer together.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.380
College sounds hard.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.220
You won't have to worry
about that, honey.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.720
Okay.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.220
Missy, don't forget that
you have to pick out a present

00:57.220 --> 00:58.890
for that birthday next week.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.810
Mom, it's "Melissa" now.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.470
Middle school.

01:02.470 --> 01:04.730
Who's Melissa?
Me.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.890
Then who's Missy?

01:05.890 --> 01:07.440
"Missy" is short for "Melissa."

01:07.440 --> 01:09.900
Like how "Billy" is short
for "William."

01:09.900 --> 01:11.820
I don't understand.

01:11.820 --> 01:14.280
You know how your
real name is William?

01:14.280 --> 01:15.780
I'm Billy.

01:15.780 --> 01:18.700
No, we call you Billy,
but your real name is William.

01:18.700 --> 01:21.200
But my underpants
say "Billy" in them.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.750
Mom, is my name William?

01:24.750 --> 01:26.250
Yeah.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.830
Then whose underpants
am I wearing?

01:30.750 --> 01:33.960
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:33.960 --> 01:37.090
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:37.090 --> 01:39.430
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:39.430 --> 01:42.100
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:42.100 --> 01:45.810
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

01:51.310 --> 01:52.320
JEFF:
Thanks again.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.240
Robin is gonna be
thrilled with this.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.000
Oh, don't thank me. Thank Mary.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.660
She's the one who said
I had to do it.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.540
Just out of curiosity,
did she also mention

02:00.540 --> 02:02.460
helping me build the crib
at some point?

02:02.460 --> 02:04.090
No.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.750
Well, act surprised
when she does.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.050
(engine sputtering outside)
GEORGE JR.: Dang it.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.800
What do you think you're doing?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.680
Trying to get the bike started.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.970
Why?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.600
So I can ride it.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.560
Like hell you are!

02:20.560 --> 02:22.480
Sorry.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.110
You don't use it.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.690
'Cause your mother won't let me.

02:25.690 --> 02:27.190
And if I can't, you can't.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.450
If I get it running,
can I at least sell it?

02:29.450 --> 02:30.700
No.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.320
But it's just sitting here.
What's the point?

02:32.320 --> 02:34.120
Point is I said no.

02:34.120 --> 02:38.330
I can't believe someone so lame
even owned a bike like this.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.500
Why are kids
such a pain in the ass?

02:46.840 --> 02:49.170
I'm sure yours will be great.

02:52.180 --> 02:54.640
I feel like this cover
really says who I am now.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.640
That looks like
all your notebooks.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.730
Missy got ponies.
Melissa gets horses.

03:00.730 --> 03:02.020
(answering machine beeps)

03:02.020 --> 03:03.850
STURGIS:
Hello, Coopers.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.770
Dr. Sturgis here.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.320
This is a message for Mary.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.780
I have some news
I need to share with you

03:09.780 --> 03:12.200
before Sheldon starts college.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.360
Please call me back.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.950
(answering machine beeps)

03:14.950 --> 03:17.660
I wonder why he'd want
to talk to you and not me.

03:17.660 --> 03:19.080
(answering machine beeps)

03:19.080 --> 03:20.540
STURGIS:
Dr. Sturgis again.

03:20.540 --> 03:22.500
If Sheldon happened to hear
that last message

03:22.500 --> 03:25.040
and is wondering why I'd want
to speak to his mother first

03:25.040 --> 03:27.130
and not him...

03:28.210 --> 03:29.670
Excellent question!

03:29.670 --> 03:33.340
It's that kind of curiosity
that makes him

03:33.340 --> 03:35.340
a true man of science.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.430
(answering machine
clicks, beeps)

03:37.430 --> 03:40.180
I'm a true man of science.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.480
(line ringing)

03:45.480 --> 03:47.730
STURGIS: Hello.
Hello, Dr. Sturgis.

03:47.730 --> 03:49.190
This is Mary Cooper.

03:49.190 --> 03:51.990
Hi. Thanks for calling me back.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.950
So, what's going on?

03:53.950 --> 03:55.360
Everything okay?

03:55.360 --> 03:58.780
Yes, everything is
quite good, actually.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.700
Well, for me, that is.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.250
Um...

04:02.250 --> 04:05.830
did you know there's
a supercollider being built

04:05.830 --> 04:07.380
in Waxahachie, Texas?

04:07.380 --> 04:09.210
No.

04:09.210 --> 04:12.050
Do you know
what a supercollider is?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.340
Not really.

04:14.340 --> 04:15.680
Would you like a crash course?

04:15.680 --> 04:17.140
Which is humorous

04:17.140 --> 04:21.520
because it involves particles
crashing into each other.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.230
I'd like you to tell me what
this has to do with Sheldon.

04:24.230 --> 04:28.360
Well, that part's less funny.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.320
I've taken a job there.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.730
Hold on.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.950
You're not gonna be around
when Sheldon starts college?

04:35.950 --> 04:38.450
That's a great question.

04:38.450 --> 04:39.410
No.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.990
John, I agreed to let him go

04:41.990 --> 04:45.250
because you were gonna be there
to look after him.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.080
I know.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.250
And I feel terrible
about it, but...

04:49.250 --> 04:51.250
please understand,

04:51.250 --> 04:55.720
this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

04:55.720 --> 04:56.630
I couldn't turn it down.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.550
Orientation starts next week.

04:58.550 --> 04:59.680
I'm aware.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.640
(sighs) Well, I hope
that you're ready

05:02.640 --> 05:04.810
to hear him freak out
when you tell him.

05:04.810 --> 05:07.100
I was kind of hoping
he'd just be excited

05:07.100 --> 05:09.270
I get to work on
the supercollider.

05:09.270 --> 05:11.360
Right, because being happy
for other people

05:11.360 --> 05:12.730
is where he shines.

05:12.730 --> 05:13.690
A supercollider?

05:13.690 --> 05:15.610
Well, you can't say no to that.

05:15.610 --> 05:16.780
I give up.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.700
Ooh, can you get me
a bumper sticker?

05:18.700 --> 05:22.910
Did you know Dr. Sturgis
was taking a new job?

05:22.910 --> 05:24.580
What job?

05:24.580 --> 05:28.420
He went to work on some
supercollider in Waxahachie.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.130
What do you mean "went"?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.460
He's already there.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.460
When did you hear this?
He just called.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.090
I was counting on him
to be there for Sheldon.

05:37.090 --> 05:40.180
Well, you'd think he would've
mentioned it to me.

05:40.180 --> 05:41.550
Sheldon says it's okay with him,

05:41.550 --> 05:43.310
but I would certainly
feel a lot better

05:43.310 --> 05:45.560
if there were adults there
that I trusted.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.190
Nothing on the
answering machine.

05:48.190 --> 05:49.600
He's just a little boy,
and he's gonna be

05:49.600 --> 05:51.560
on that big campus
all by himself.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.440
I mean, I know
we're not dating anymore,

05:53.440 --> 05:54.940
but I thought
we were still friends.

05:54.940 --> 05:56.570
Excuse me.

05:56.570 --> 05:59.150
I think you're focusing on the
wrong part of the story here.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.530
He's little, you're worried.
Please continue.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.330
That sums it up.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.160
Okay.

06:14.550 --> 06:15.550
Missy.

06:15.550 --> 06:17.590
(groans)

06:17.590 --> 06:18.510
What?

06:18.510 --> 06:20.180
Help me with my clothes.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.930
Burn them and get new ones.

06:21.930 --> 06:23.850
Please, it's
freshman orientation.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.680
I want to make
a good impression.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.600
Fine.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.850
Which bow tie says
mature enough to be in college

06:30.850 --> 06:33.480
but whimsical enough
to discuss which came first,

06:33.480 --> 06:35.480
the Higgs field or the photon?

06:36.610 --> 06:38.610
They both say
weird kid who eats alone.

06:38.610 --> 06:40.530
Come on.
I know you're concerned about

06:40.530 --> 06:42.280
what you'll wear
to middle school.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.620
(sighs) Show me again.

06:45.790 --> 06:48.250
The blue one. Plaid's too busy.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.910
Thanks.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.130
Or don't be the kid
in a bow tie.

06:52.130 --> 06:54.880
This is not the day to go crazy.

06:57.380 --> 07:00.300
My son, the college freshman.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.090
I can't believe it.

07:02.090 --> 07:03.470
How can you not believe it?

07:03.470 --> 07:05.300
You had to sign
my vaccination form.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.640
Right.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.220
So, what do you
want to do first?

07:08.220 --> 07:10.270
I was thinking we could
start at the bookstore,

07:10.270 --> 07:11.730
try and beat the lines.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.310
I agree about the lines,
but what do you mean "we"?

07:14.310 --> 07:16.650
I mean you and me.

07:16.650 --> 07:18.440
This is my first day.
I can't be seen

07:18.440 --> 07:20.400
walking around campus
with my mommy.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.910
Well, it's only orientation.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.320
Yes, and I'm quite capable
of handling everything

07:25.320 --> 07:27.240
that I need to get done today
on my own.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.790
I'm sure you are.

07:28.790 --> 07:31.830
I just figured,
with Dr. Sturgis not around,

07:31.830 --> 07:33.710
it might be nice if I could be.

07:33.710 --> 07:36.210
No one else's mother
is going to be.

07:36.210 --> 07:37.550
You don't know that.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.550
Well, I know mine isn't.

07:39.550 --> 07:41.880
(sighs) You might want
to watch the attitude

07:41.880 --> 07:44.050
to the person who's
driving you there.

07:44.050 --> 07:45.600
Not all the way there.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.600
Drop me off a block away
so no one sees us together.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.560
Sorry, I am not leaving you
alone your first day.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.730
Yes, you are.

07:51.730 --> 07:54.230
For someone going into college,

07:54.230 --> 07:56.230
you are acting very childish.

07:56.230 --> 07:57.610
Maybe it just appears that way

07:57.610 --> 07:59.360
because you see me
with my mommy.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.360
Oh...

08:02.700 --> 08:05.200
Boy, I remember putting one of
these together for Georgie.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.450
It is great having
y'all next door.

08:07.450 --> 08:10.240
Did you not hear me yelling
at Georgie last night?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.460
It's okay. I'm sure
you'll hear our little one

08:12.460 --> 08:13.620
crying soon enough.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.000
Missy was a crier.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.840
Sheldon just learned
to talk and said,

08:17.840 --> 08:19.920
"Father, I have soiled myself."

08:19.920 --> 08:22.760
Well, he's a miracle
in his own way.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.640
Oh, you just put a positive spin
on everything, don't you?

08:25.640 --> 08:28.180
Kind of goes with
the pastor territory.

08:28.180 --> 08:29.890
Okay.

08:29.890 --> 08:31.180
What if I said

08:31.180 --> 08:32.980
Mary and I have not had

08:32.980 --> 08:35.810
a real vacation
since we had kids?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.730
I like to believe
starting a family

08:38.730 --> 08:41.360
will be the most rewarding
adventure of all.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.650
You're good. (chuckles)

08:44.650 --> 08:47.620
You could not be more wrong,
but you're good.
