16:04.920 --> 16:06.704
to my aunt before she passed.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.577
Anyway, Jess.
Uh, can we, uh... can we talk?

16:09.620 --> 16:11.013
Uh, we're a little bit busy.
We're opening mail right now.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.232
Well, it's only gonna take
a minute, Nick.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.755
Sure. We'll be opening mail

16:13.798 --> 16:15.539
-before you know it.
-But don't open that one.

16:15.583 --> 16:16.976
It might have a bomb in it.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.542
So...

16:18.586 --> 16:19.543
Okay.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.763
-Okay. Thanks.
-Come on in.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.025
How'd you even know
we still lived here?

16:23.069 --> 16:25.419
-I just knew.
-Ooh. Russy.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.685
This used to be Nick's room,
but now it's his home office.

16:30.728 --> 16:34.036
Listen, about earlier today,
when I lied about me and Nick...

16:34.080 --> 16:36.691
I don't think I can spend
another second of my day

16:36.734 --> 16:39.041
and possibly my life
talking about you and Nick.

16:39.085 --> 16:42.305
Oh. Most people
find us adorable, but okay.

16:42.349 --> 16:43.350
Come to work for me.

16:43.393 --> 16:44.394
I was being serious earlier.

16:44.438 --> 16:45.569
I've spent a year

16:45.613 --> 16:46.875
looking for the right person,

16:46.918 --> 16:48.529
and I think you'd be perfect.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.400
I know you're planning a trip,
so hear me out.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.402
-I'd...
-Wait.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.884
-I don't know what
you do, still. [chuckles] -Yes.

16:55.927 --> 16:59.061
I was going to cover that
in the "hear me out" portion.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.107
I think at our kid's party,
we go cash bar.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.718
-Cash bar would solve
a lot of problems. -Yeah.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.025
Coach, listen, I'm still waiting
for your vote for those pictures

17:06.068 --> 17:07.287
that I sent you, so...

17:07.330 --> 17:09.158
Winston,
just pick yourfavorite.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.551
Baby, they're all my favorite.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.943
Why can't you see

17:11.987 --> 17:13.119
that you being pregnant
has made you

17:13.162 --> 17:14.381
more beautiful than ever?

17:14.424 --> 17:16.557
You know what? Fine.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.080
I'll pick one, okay?

17:25.261 --> 17:27.176
Oh, my God, I ambeautiful.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.919
Mother Earth. Creator.
Giver of life.

17:30.962 --> 17:31.963
Give that life.

17:32.007 --> 17:32.964
I'm a walking miracle

17:33.008 --> 17:34.227
with magic inside.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.576
Well, I mean,
it happens to a lot of people,

17:35.619 --> 17:36.968
so it's not really a miracle,
but I get it.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.666
Look at that body.
And there's a human

17:38.709 --> 17:40.102
inside of it?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.974
-Yeah. -Why have you been
so casual about that?

17:43.018 --> 17:44.193
This is crazy, babe.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.108
W-What are you doing
just sitting there?

17:46.152 --> 17:47.892
Get a chair.
Help me get off my feet.

17:47.936 --> 17:50.721
I've got the beginning
of our family in here.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.507
-[sighs]
-Baby, can I get you anything?

17:53.550 --> 17:55.726
-Anything at all?
-Yes!

17:55.770 --> 17:56.988
Like what?

17:57.032 --> 17:58.686
-Everything.
-Coming right up.

17:58.729 --> 17:59.904
JESS:
Bye, Russell.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.950
NICK:
Hey.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.952
-Did he like my home office?
-Yes. He said it reminded him

18:03.995 --> 18:05.780
of his home office.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.956
Well, that's because I copied
his home office exactly.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.132
-Uh, now onto the mail.
-Oh, wait.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.134
He offered me a job.
He's starting

18:12.178 --> 18:14.180
an education-based nonprofit
and wants me to run it.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.398
But I wouldn't be able to go

18:15.442 --> 18:16.834
-with you to South America.
-Who cares?

18:16.878 --> 18:18.488
You should take that job.
It's a big opportunity.

18:18.532 --> 18:19.968
Do you want to open the mail?
Let's just see what's inside.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.143
-Just open it.
-Okay.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.797
I'm wondering
if you'll get excited.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.147
-Oh, come on. -Sorry, we have
to do the cake at your house.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.670
Someone stole all our knives.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.846
-Hi, Uncle Nick.
-And a nightstand.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.718
Uh, I'm sorry,
you guys can't be here.

18:30.761 --> 18:32.154
We're opening mail right now.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.287
Nick's really into mail
all of a sudden.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.463
You never know
what Europe's gonna do to a guy.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.987
Yeah, so...
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.336
You guys will never believe

18:40.380 --> 18:42.338
what's happening right now.

18:42.382 --> 18:43.687
Okay, fine, I'll tell you.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.820
Aly is taking a nap.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.518
I was watching her,
and then I left, and...

18:48.562 --> 18:50.172
[laughs]

18:50.216 --> 18:51.913
That's one big-ass cake.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.784
I guess we're gonna open mail
in front of everybody.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.353
NICK:
Great. Uh...

18:57.397 --> 18:58.789
Jess, you want to go ahead?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.182
Yeah.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.184
I just want to say
we really missed you guys.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.360
And Nick,
I don't need to be married

19:04.404 --> 19:06.188
to know who we are.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.016
-Really?
-Really. I love you,

19:08.059 --> 19:09.496
and I love our life together,

19:09.539 --> 19:10.975
and I don't want anything
to change.

19:11.019 --> 19:13.848
And the moment
that someone suggested

19:13.891 --> 19:16.024
that we weren't where
we should be, I went crazy.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.852
Because we're great.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.506
And why risk messing that up?

19:19.549 --> 19:21.203
We don't need to get married,

19:21.247 --> 19:23.553
and that's okay with us.
Right, Nick?

19:25.555 --> 19:27.340
Yeah, right. [chuckles]

19:29.298 --> 19:31.039
So, let's see what Turkey wants.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.519
Ah, enough of that.
Give me that.

19:32.562 --> 19:33.868
Who cares what Turkey wants?

19:33.911 --> 19:36.349
Cake beats mail.
We got a hungry birthday girl

19:36.392 --> 19:37.915
right here,
I don't want to bore her

19:37.959 --> 19:40.179
-with foreign mail.
-I like mail.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.832
Oh, you don't know what you
like. You're three years old.

19:43.399 --> 19:44.879
[chuckles] Excuse me.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.882
I got to go wash my hands.
I've been in Europe.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.101
SCHMIDT:
Is he suggesting

19:50.145 --> 19:53.540
that he hasn't washed his hands
since Europe?

19:53.583 --> 19:54.758
Bob, I can't do it tonight.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.760
[groans]

19:56.804 --> 19:58.719
I'm sorry, but this thing

19:58.762 --> 20:00.634
has been ten years
in the making,

20:00.677 --> 20:02.766
and everything about
the proposal has to be perfect.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.768
-And I'll know when the time
is right. -You know what?

20:04.812 --> 20:06.770
I'm rescinding my blessing.

20:06.814 --> 20:09.208
You want to marry my daughter?
You got to resubmit

20:09.251 --> 20:11.079
for a new blessing.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.081
And it better be as good
as the first time you asked.

20:13.124 --> 20:15.562
[sighs] Okay.

20:15.605 --> 20:19.174
Bob, I am in love
with your daughter,

20:19.218 --> 20:22.395
and I will be
for the rest of my life.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.093
I want to ask her
to marry me,

20:25.136 --> 20:27.443
but only with your blessing.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.663
All right, all right.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.230
Yeah, y-you got it.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.275
But this time
there's a time limit on it.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.624
One month. You hear me?

20:34.668 --> 20:37.497
-One month!
-One month.
