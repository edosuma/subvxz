I've been lookin' for you.

01:34.761 --> 01:35.678
You got a package.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.805
- Oh, it's here.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.847
Sweet.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.349
- What'd you get?

01:39.432 --> 01:40.975
- Well, when I was talkin'
to my grandfather

01:41.059 --> 01:43.561
on the phone last week,
I dropped a gentle suggestion

01:43.645 --> 01:46.022
that I might want
the new G-O mp3 player,

01:46.105 --> 01:47.106
and now,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.692
a package
from Grandpa Joe.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.654
You know, this new G-O
has got an 80-gig hard drive,

01:52.737 --> 01:54.989
dual ear bud ports,
so you can listen with a friend,

01:55.073 --> 01:56.157
and...

01:56.241 --> 01:58.493
I don't understand
what this is.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.665
- An old radio?

02:03.748 --> 02:05.291
- Oh, Grandpa.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.336
- There's a note.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.551
- "Chase,
when I was in high school,

02:14.634 --> 02:17.345
"this is the radio
I listened to every night.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.221
"It was good enough for me,

02:18.304 --> 02:21.140
so it's good enough for you.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.684

02:40.660 --> 02:42.871
- Your money,
your taco coupon.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.247
- Your prehistoric radio.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.000
Hey.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.419
This coupon
expires tonight.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.543
- I'm not being rude.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.300
- Okay, fair enough.

03:42.221 --> 03:43.848
Hey, speaking of boyfriends,

03:43.932 --> 03:45.850
I heard Ethan Medavoy
asked you out again.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.311
- Yeah, but I said no.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.188
- Why? He's adorable.

03:50.271 --> 03:51.648
- He kisses like a sheepdog.
Ech.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.566
- Ew.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.151
- Yeah.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.445
So, how's <i> your</i> boy?

03:57.528 --> 03:58.905
- Oh, Mark's good.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.907
He finally got rid
of that fungus under his arm.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.158
- No.
I mean...

04:02.241 --> 04:04.160
is he a good kisser?

04:04.243 --> 04:06.996
- Oh, um...

04:07.080 --> 04:09.165
he's an excellent kisser.

04:09.248 --> 04:09.749
Mmm.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.501
- Keep talkin'.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.835
Make with the details.

04:12.919 --> 04:13.836
- Well, um,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.171
you know, his, um,

04:15.254 --> 04:18.132
his lips are just really soft,

04:18.216 --> 04:21.135
like...like two gummy worms

04:21.219 --> 04:25.223

04:25.306 --> 04:26.599

I should dye my hair?

04:28.267 --> 04:29.435

04:29.519 --> 04:30.895
- Why are you

- Well,

04:31.854 --> 04:34.190

04:34.274 --> 04:36.609
okay, we've never kissed.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.694
- What?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.195
- Mark and I have never kissed.

04:39.278 --> 04:40.446
- What?
- Stop saying "what?"

04:40.530 --> 04:43.074
- You've been dating
for almost two years!

04:43.157 --> 04:44.951
- Please don't tell anyone.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.327
- What's up, roomies?

04:46.411 --> 04:47.870
- Quinn and Mark
have never kissed.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.913
- Thanks.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.039
- What?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.833
You guys have been
dating for two years.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.251
How could you not--
- It's not me, it's Mark!

04:53.334 --> 04:54.460
And I don't wanna talk about it.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.504
- What's that?

04:56.587 --> 04:58.506
- A radio.
I bought it from Chase.

04:58.589 --> 04:59.966
- How old is that thing?

05:00.049 --> 05:00.883
- I'm not sure.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.510
- Here.
I'll check online.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.265
Oh, what kind of radio is it?

05:07.348 --> 05:08.391
- Just says...

05:08.474 --> 05:09.976
Fada model 115.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.855
- Fada model 115.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.565
- He's never even tried
to kiss you?

05:15.648 --> 05:17.400
- We're talking
about radios now!

05:21.112 --> 05:22.613
Oh, here it is.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.325
"Fada radio, model 115,

05:26.409 --> 05:27.994
also called 'The Bullet.'

05:28.077 --> 05:29.954
Manufactured in 1941."

05:30.038 --> 05:32.457
- Wow.
- Cool.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.752
- Um, "made of an antique
plastic called Catalin,

05:35.835 --> 05:37.837

- Oh, my god.
- Seriously?

05:45.428 --> 05:46.971
- Look! That's what it says!

05:47.055 --> 05:48.056
- Whoa.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.223
- How much
did you give Chase for it?

05:49.307 --> 05:51.601
- Five bucks and a free taco.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.020
- I hope it was a $10,000 taco.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.275
- So what are you gonna do
with the cash?

05:59.358 --> 05:59.817
- I'm not gonna sell this.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.278
- Ooh, smart.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.571
Hang onto it, and in five years,

06:03.654 --> 06:05.448
it'll probably be worth 50,000.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.075
- No, I'm giving this
back to Chase.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.702
- Why?
- She has to.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.496
Chase is her friend.
- But he sold it to you.

06:11.579 --> 06:12.830
A deal's a deal.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.499
- But Chase didn't know
what it was worth.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.875
- Exactly. Which is why
I'm gonna go tell him.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.627
- No.
Zoey!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.462
- Good.

06:20.505 --> 06:20.922
Not one kiss?

06:21.005 --> 06:22.799
- Stop it!

06:31.265 --> 06:33.935
- Quinn.
- Hi, cuteness.

06:34.018 --> 06:34.977
What you doin'?

06:35.061 --> 06:36.020
- Just some laundry.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.230
Is this stuff
effective on stains?

06:37.313 --> 06:39.440
- Uh, what kind of stains?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.234
- Uh, forget it.
What's up?

06:41.317 --> 06:42.777
- Well, I just finished dinner,

06:42.860 --> 06:45.279
and I thought I'd bring my baby
a little dessert.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.197
- Ah.

06:46.280 --> 06:46.989
So what'd you bring me?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.158
- Lactose-free ice cream,

06:49.242 --> 06:52.328
your favorite flavor.

06:52.411 --> 06:53.329
- Vanilla.

You always know what I want.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.290
- Mm-hmm.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.543
And do you know what I want?

07:02.630 --> 07:04.173
- What's wrong with your lip?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.424
- Nothing.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.135
I thought
maybe you'd want to kiss me.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.302
- No.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.762
- But why not?

this is the right moment.

- Look, I really
gotta do this laundry.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.396
Thanks for the stuff.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.522

08:36.724 --> 08:38.433

- Yeah.

08:38.517 --> 08:39.936
He asked his grandfather
for one,

08:40.019 --> 08:41.270
and he just sent him
a nasty old radio.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.773
- Uh, not so nasty.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.149
That radio turned out to be

18:33.654 --> 18:35.739
I say we need a do-over.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.241
- Hey, guys,
I told you.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.867
Chase--

18:38.951 --> 18:40.536
- His grandfather
gave it to him.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.870
He really deserves it.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.580

[everyone arguing]

19:00.430 --> 19:01.515
- Mark.

19:02.349 --> 19:05.018
Thanks for being the mediator.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.311
- Sure.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.438
What else would I have to do
at 3:00 in the morning?

19:08.522 --> 19:10.732
- Well, I just wanted to say

19:10.816 --> 19:13.026
I think you made
the right decision, and I--

19:22.578 --> 19:22.995
You kissed me.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.997
- I know.

19:25.080 --> 19:25.247
I was there.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.417
- But...but why now?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.585
Why was this the right moment?

19:29.668 --> 19:30.711
- Well,

19:30.794 --> 19:33.380
were you expecting it?

19:33.463 --> 19:35.007
- Not at all.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.925
- That's why.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.429
So...

19:40.512 --> 19:41.889
[sniffs]

19:41.972 --> 19:44.057
I'm a pretty good kisser,

Listen, when I found out
this radio

20:56.004 --> 20:57.339
was worth so much money,

I was absolutely gonna give it

I was a bad friend.

Hey, I got an idea.

but that was not my idea.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.463
I was thinking,

21:38.547 --> 21:42.300

radio is worth 10,000 bucks,

21:42.384 --> 21:43.510
let's split it.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.053
