WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:03.417
-NARRATOR: Tonight...
-Let's get some gold, baby!

00:03.542 --> 00:05.333
-Yes!
-...on <i>Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:05.458 --> 00:08.583
The American Gold Rush actually
started in North Carolina.

00:08.708 --> 00:11.917
-Wow.
-Oh, my gosh.

00:12.042 --> 00:15.083
Tim and Ross Fisher found
a massive gold dredge

00:15.208 --> 00:17.125
-on their property.
-What's your estimate?

00:17.208 --> 00:19.542
There's two billion dollars'
worth of gold.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.458
-It's like Christmas, guys.
-Let's open some presents.

00:22.708 --> 00:24.167
-TIM: See anything, Ross?
-MATTY: You think that's gold?

00:24.292 --> 00:25.833
-Yeah, it's gold.
-No way!

00:25.958 --> 00:27.708
-I can't believe it.
-Ahh!

00:27.875 --> 00:28.750
(laughing)

00:28.875 --> 00:30.333
-(whoops)
-Yes!

00:32.417 --> 00:34.083
All the while
we were growing up,

00:34.208 --> 00:37.458
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:38.708 --> 00:39.542
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:39.667 --> 00:41.000
cursed treasure.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.083
Civil War gold.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.958
-(laughter)
-Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:46.042 --> 00:48.167
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:48.250 --> 00:51.167
-Whoa.
-...waiting to be explored.

00:51.250 --> 00:54.042
RICK:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.250
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.500
-MARTY: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

00:58.625 --> 01:01.125
-...and share our insights.
-"Ill-gotten gains."

01:01.208 --> 01:02.500
-RICK: And who knows...
-GARY: I got it.

01:02.583 --> 01:04.333
...maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:04.417 --> 01:06.000
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.833
Wow. That is gold.

01:07.917 --> 01:09.708
-RICK: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:09.875 --> 01:11.500
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:19.208 --> 01:20.583
MATTY: You know,
the reason I called you

01:20.708 --> 01:23.125
in the war room today
is because I wonder how you guys

01:23.250 --> 01:24.958
-are gonna react to this word.
-All right.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.500
Gold.

01:26.625 --> 01:29.125
Oh, baby.
(chuckles)

01:29.208 --> 01:31.750
Who reacts any different
to that word?

01:31.875 --> 01:33.292
Say the word "treasure,"

01:33.417 --> 01:35.042
what's the first word
that comes to your mind?

01:35.208 --> 01:36.000
-Gold.
-Gold.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.167
There you go.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.083
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

01:39.208 --> 01:41.833
Because I've always thought
of the '49er,

01:41.958 --> 01:45.167
San Francisco, the Gold Rush,
you know, an old prospector

01:45.333 --> 01:47.000
with a pickaxe
and a pan, right?

01:47.083 --> 01:49.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, I've come to learn

01:49.083 --> 01:51.042
recently that
that's not even close

01:51.167 --> 01:52.667
to the whole story in America,

01:52.792 --> 01:54.833
and that the Gold Rush

01:54.958 --> 01:58.167
actually started
in North Carolina.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.250
In fact, not only did it start
in North Carolina,

02:00.375 --> 02:04.167
every bit of gold that went to
the U.S. Treasury domestically

02:04.333 --> 02:09.833
from 1804 to 1828
was found in North Carolina.

02:09.917 --> 02:11.625
-Wow.
-I didn't know that.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.167
NARRATOR: The first
great era of gold mining

02:15.250 --> 02:17.333
in the United States began

02:17.458 --> 02:20.125
under the most unlikely
of circumstances--

02:20.208 --> 02:22.833
when a young boy
made a chance discovery

02:22.958 --> 02:26.500
near Charlotte,
North Carolina, in 1799.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.708
BALDWIN:
A 12-year-old boy
named Conrad Reed

02:28.875 --> 02:32.292
went fishing one afternoon
on his family farm,

02:32.375 --> 02:36.958
and he stumbled across
a 17-pound nugget.

02:37.042 --> 02:38.542
At the time,
he didn't know what he had.

02:38.708 --> 02:42.250
He brought it home, showed it
to his father, John Reed.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.167
And John obviously didn't know
what he had, either,

02:44.333 --> 02:47.500
because he used that nugget
for a doorstop.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.792
And for about five years,
that nugget stayed in his home,

02:51.917 --> 02:54.667
behind a door, until a jeweler

02:54.750 --> 02:58.833
saw what he had and
offered him some money for it.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.167
He ended up paying $3.50,

03:01.333 --> 03:05.375
which was valued
about $66 in today's money,

03:05.500 --> 03:10.542
for that 17-pound,
22-karat nugget.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.333
NARRATOR:
Although John Reed was not paid

03:13.458 --> 03:17.458
what the 17-pound golden
nugget was worth in 1799,

03:17.542 --> 03:21.250
which was approximately $5,000,

03:21.375 --> 03:23.917
he soon found
another one on his property

03:24.042 --> 03:27.208
weighing an astonishing
28 pounds.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.042
The discovery spread
in the local newspapers,

03:30.167 --> 03:32.167
leading to many farmers
in the area

03:32.292 --> 03:34.375
becoming part-time gold miners

03:34.542 --> 03:37.167
and searching the rivers
and streams on their land

03:37.292 --> 03:39.000
throughout the state.

03:39.125 --> 03:42.667
By 1804, so much gold
was being recovered

03:42.833 --> 03:45.333
that a wave of highly skilled
Cornish miners from England

03:45.458 --> 03:47.583
emigrated to the United States,

03:47.708 --> 03:50.333
sparking the nation's
first gold rush.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.125
BALDWIN: At the peak
of the gold mining

03:52.208 --> 03:54.708
in North Carolina,
there were 600 mines

03:54.833 --> 03:56.667
all the way through
seven or eight counties.

03:56.750 --> 03:59.667
In fact, there was
so much gold being produced

03:59.750 --> 04:03.083
that a branch of the government
built a mint in Charlotte

04:03.208 --> 04:04.875
just for those gold coins.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.083
Stories are fanciful

04:07.208 --> 04:09.500
of just reaching your hand
into a riverbed

04:09.625 --> 04:12.667
and pulling up
huge nuggets of gold.

04:12.792 --> 04:15.958
To a growing nation,
those types of stories

04:16.083 --> 04:17.833
are irresistible.

04:17.917 --> 04:19.458
Finding gold wasn't luck.

04:19.542 --> 04:22.750
It was a combination
of art and science.

04:22.875 --> 04:26.333
NARRATOR: Gold mining
in both North and South Carolina

04:26.417 --> 04:28.500
would produce millions
of dollars in gold

04:28.625 --> 04:30.833
over the next half century,

04:30.958 --> 04:34.333
until the California Gold Rush
began in 1848,

04:34.417 --> 04:36.708
which spurred
many skilled miners

04:36.833 --> 04:38.667
to pick up and head west

04:38.833 --> 04:41.833
in search of new
and greater fortunes.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
BALDWIN:
The North Carolina mines

04:44.083 --> 04:46.542
operated for around 100 years.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.667
And in my opinion,
there's still

04:48.750 --> 04:50.375
millions of dollars'
worth of gold

04:50.500 --> 04:51.792
just waiting to be discovered.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.375
There was a gold rush
before the Gold Rush

04:55.542 --> 04:58.167
in North Carolina,
someplace I've been many times,

04:58.250 --> 04:59.458
but never knew that history.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.542
And I stumbled across
this article

05:01.667 --> 05:04.000
about a family,
Tim and Ross Fisher.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.125
-Okay.
-And these guys...

05:05.250 --> 05:06.583
-Father-son?
-Father-son.

05:06.708 --> 05:10.500
They found a giant,
massive gold dredge

05:10.583 --> 05:13.500
on their property,
and they are uncovering it

05:13.667 --> 05:17.208
and basically trying to make it
almost like a living museum,

05:17.333 --> 05:19.167
but also, they're finding
gold on that property.

05:19.333 --> 05:22.083
-Mm-hmm.
-MATTY: So,
they are finding gold

05:22.208 --> 05:24.000
in the dredge itself.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.833
-Hm.
-Remnants of the gold.

05:25.917 --> 05:28.500
And they are more than eager
to talk to us,

05:28.625 --> 05:29.667
if you guys want to try
and find some gold.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.083
MARTY:
Well, it sounds interesting.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.500
-Sounds real interesting.
-Right?

05:32.625 --> 05:33.250
RICK: Different sort
of approach, isn't it?

05:33.375 --> 05:34.417
Well, let's talk to him.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.875
Yeah?
Let's hunt some gold!

05:36.042 --> 05:36.833
-Yeah.
-North Carolina style.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.417
North Carolina gold.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.250
Let's go to the South,
gentlemen.

05:40.375 --> 05:41.542
And there they are.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.250
(overlapping greetings)

05:43.375 --> 05:45.583
-What's up, guys?
-Hey, how's it going?

05:45.708 --> 05:48.042
Well, it's Matty Blake here,

05:48.208 --> 05:50.458
and I have Rick
and Marty Lagina with me.

05:50.542 --> 05:53.458
I know we spoke via email,
but could you fill us in

05:53.542 --> 05:55.875
on what exactly you found
on your property,

05:56.000 --> 05:57.208
and what's happening now?

05:57.375 --> 06:01.292
Sure, I would say
probably seven years ago

06:01.417 --> 06:03.042
we purchased some land.

06:03.167 --> 06:06.667
It was gold mine land
in Nash County, North Carolina.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.708
We paid a bit of money
for this land.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.417
We knew it was gold mine land,
but we got picked on--

06:11.542 --> 06:13.708
Yeah, part of that's a valley,
and it's just, you know...

06:13.875 --> 06:16.167
-Swampy land.
-It's not really the best place

06:16.250 --> 06:18.375
to buy land.
It's like, well, you know...

06:18.542 --> 06:19.833
-We're gonna do it anyways.
-We're gonna buy it anyway.

06:19.958 --> 06:22.125
So, we bought it,
and the funny thing is,

06:22.250 --> 06:24.625
two years later,
then we discovered

06:24.708 --> 06:26.875
this big dredge and all that,
and we had no idea.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.667
And the same people
that were talking junk,

06:28.750 --> 06:30.250
they wanted to come down
and get a tour.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.625
-Yeah.
-Yes.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.333
-That's the way it works.
-MATTY: Yeah.

06:34.458 --> 06:35.792
My name's Tim Fisher,

06:35.875 --> 06:37.833
and I'm from Nashville,
North Carolina.

06:37.958 --> 06:39.167
And Ross Fisher, my son.

06:39.292 --> 06:41.125
Me and my dad
are gold prospectors,

06:41.208 --> 06:42.708
treasure hunters.

06:42.875 --> 06:45.125
The Indiana Jones
of North Carolina, if you will.

06:45.250 --> 06:48.500
TIM:
We discovered a dredge in 2019.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.833
It was like
uncovering a painting.

06:50.958 --> 06:53.833
It was like...
It just was staggering.

06:53.917 --> 06:56.250
NARRATOR: The dredge,
which was constructed

06:56.375 --> 06:59.750
in the early 1900s,
is actually a ship

06:59.875 --> 07:02.250
that was designed
to float in shallow water

07:02.375 --> 07:05.167
while scooping soil
into compartments.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.875
These collected materials
were then sifted

07:08.000 --> 07:09.542
through an onboard sluice

07:09.667 --> 07:12.458
to separate fine gold
from the sediment.

07:12.583 --> 07:17.542
Abandoned around 1912,
over time the vessel sank

07:17.667 --> 07:19.750
into the mud,
where it was preserved

07:19.875 --> 07:23.125
until the Fishers
discovered it in 2019.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.417
TIM:
This dredge had been lost
for 100 years.

07:26.542 --> 07:27.625
But we do know
that there's still

07:27.708 --> 07:29.000
quite a lot of gold in it.

07:29.167 --> 07:31.708
We are finding gold in there.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.167
You know, it's small gold,
but it's a lot of it.

07:34.333 --> 07:35.833
It's just taking us more time.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.958
Our ultimate plan
for this whole crazy thing

07:39.042 --> 07:43.000
that we're doing, is we want
to dig this dredge up.

07:43.167 --> 07:45.167
We would like to turn it
into more like a museum.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.500
We're preserving a piece
of the past for people to see,

07:47.667 --> 07:49.792
so telling the story.

07:49.875 --> 07:52.542
-That's the true treasure to us.
-Yeah, true.

07:52.667 --> 07:55.500
Where are you guys right now,

07:55.625 --> 07:58.250
in terms of your efforts
to uncover this dredge?

07:58.375 --> 07:59.667
How much have you done?

07:59.750 --> 08:02.333
Well, we've got half
of the dredge uncovered.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.917
-On top.
-To where you can see

08:04.042 --> 08:05.667
the footprint real clear.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.042
-Okay.
-The timbers.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.333
So, we're just getting started.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.750
And the crazy thing
about all this

08:10.875 --> 08:15.333
is this dredge is buried
three feet underground.

08:15.458 --> 08:18.333
It's 94 feet long,
it's 32 feet wide.

08:18.458 --> 08:19.500
-Geez.
-That's big.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.375
-Wow.
-We've built this crane

08:22.542 --> 08:25.542
to get to the lower sections
of the dredge

08:25.708 --> 08:27.875
to get the material out
where we can find

08:28.000 --> 08:32.333
a lot of the bigger gold,
more gold, and possibly...

08:32.500 --> 08:34.083
-Artifacts, yeah.
-...artifacts.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.917
There's obviously--
and no pun intended--

08:37.042 --> 08:38.875
you know,
it's rich history here.

08:39.042 --> 08:41.875
So, you must have
thought about, you know,

08:42.042 --> 08:44.833
how much-- I'll call them
gold reserves--

08:44.958 --> 08:47.500
still are in the area.
What's your estimate?

08:47.583 --> 08:51.583
Just in the area, there's
two billion dollars' worth

08:51.708 --> 08:52.750
of gold sitting right now.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.333
-Still in there.
-Billion.

08:54.458 --> 08:55.833
Not million, billion.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.500
-(chuckling)
-He wants to be clear on that.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.875
And that's not including
probably what's in

09:00.000 --> 09:01.708
those tailing piles,
those dredge piles.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.875
There's acres of dredge piles
that's never been touched,

09:05.042 --> 09:06.917
ten feet deep,
that there's gotta be

09:07.042 --> 09:08.500
some good gold in there.

09:09.708 --> 09:11.833
NARRATOR: As the dredge
traversed the land,

09:11.958 --> 09:15.250
digging as deep
as 30 feet into the ground,

09:15.375 --> 09:18.000
finer materials
were sifted for gold.

09:18.083 --> 09:21.250
However, much of the sediment
and large rocks

09:21.375 --> 09:23.458
were immediately ejected
from the vessel,

09:23.583 --> 09:25.417
forming large piles.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.667
They wouldn't catch
all the big gold.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.292
Anything that was quarter-inch
or bigger than that

09:30.375 --> 09:32.042
got shot right out of the back.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.292
So, your big, chunky nuggets
got thrown right out the back.

09:34.417 --> 09:36.875
So, they lost
a lot of good gold.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.792
I think there's a lot
of good stuff back there.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.875
So, what's your--
what's your plan?

09:41.042 --> 09:42.667
Obviously, you want to recover
some of this gold

09:42.792 --> 09:44.000
that's overlooked.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.750
Are you interested in us
kinda helping out

09:45.875 --> 09:47.917
a little bit on this?
'Cause this sounds really cool.

09:48.042 --> 09:51.667
We-- we need some expertise,
some advice.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.958
We know you guys have been doing
digging for a long time,

09:55.042 --> 09:57.667
and you know, whatever you guys
can do to help us out,

09:57.750 --> 09:59.750
man, I tell you,
it would be a blessing.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.333
We-we really could
use your help.

10:01.417 --> 10:03.750
I'm intrigued enough
to suggest this.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.333
Matty, you'd be--
you're up for it, right?

10:05.458 --> 10:06.542
-Oh, of course.
-He's good with a shovel.

10:06.708 --> 10:08.625
-Yeah.
-But then, isn't there

10:08.708 --> 10:10.333
another component to this
when you search

10:10.417 --> 10:12.625
those old tailings piles,

10:12.750 --> 10:14.083
there's stuff that might
be left there.

10:14.208 --> 10:16.083
-That's right.
-We know it's there for a fact.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.625
-They need a metal detector.
-Definitely.

10:18.708 --> 10:21.625
Why don't we send Matty
and a metal-detecting expert

10:21.708 --> 10:23.333
along with him?

10:23.500 --> 10:25.417
He can do the first sort of
interaction with you guys,

10:25.542 --> 10:27.000
and then we can go from there.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.000
I mean, it sounds like
a real interesting thing.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.625
MATTY: I do know
the metal detectorist,

10:30.708 --> 10:32.875
and she's good.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.333
She knows her coins,
she knows her precious metals.

10:36.417 --> 10:38.417
Why don't we put her
on your team?

10:38.542 --> 10:39.792
-Okay.
-MARTY: If she's willing,
of course.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.458
I think she's more than willing,
yeah.

10:41.542 --> 10:43.458
All right, let's just
get after it, then.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.333
-What do you say?
-I'm ready, guys.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.750
I-I can't wait to see you guys.

10:47.875 --> 10:50.000
You'll have a Yankee
down in the South.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.542
-I'd love to look for
some gold with you.
-We will, come on!

10:52.708 --> 10:54.042
(laughter)

10:54.208 --> 10:56.000
All right, go dig up
a dredge, Matty.

10:57.375 --> 10:58.875
RICK:
Go dig up some gold.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.125
Well, we made it, Nikoline,
we're here.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.542
I know.
It's so beautiful down here.

11:11.708 --> 11:12.833
Two New Englanders
in the South.

11:12.958 --> 11:15.708
-Let's go.
-(chuckles) All right.

11:15.833 --> 11:18.167
NARRATOR: In Nash County,
North Carolina,

11:18.292 --> 11:21.042
Matty Blake
and metal detection expert

11:21.208 --> 11:23.833
Nikoline Bohr are heading
to the property

11:23.917 --> 11:25.833
of father and son
treasure hunters

11:26.000 --> 11:29.042
Tim and Ross Fisher
to help them search for gold

11:29.167 --> 11:33.250
believed to be contained on
a 19th-century mining dredge.

11:33.375 --> 11:36.958
Out of your list of ethics,
like, what's your golden rule?

11:37.042 --> 11:40.125
If you had to pick one, like,
when you're treasure hunting,

11:40.208 --> 11:41.792
-what's the number-one
golden rule, do you think?
-Uh...

11:41.875 --> 11:43.583
I think the most important,

11:43.708 --> 11:45.167
and probably
the least talked about

11:45.292 --> 11:48.375
is respecting the history
that you're hunting for.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.667
Yes. Your love of history

11:51.833 --> 11:54.167
-is really palpable.
-Mm-hmm.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.875
And I know that Rick and Marty
really appreciate that.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.667
-Yes.
-How are you feeling

11:58.792 --> 12:00.375
about finding gold
in the next couple days?

12:00.500 --> 12:02.333
Excited, thrilled.

12:03.708 --> 12:05.208
NARRATOR:
Originally from Denmark,

12:05.333 --> 12:08.125
Nikoline Bohr has spent
the last seven years

12:08.208 --> 12:11.125
living on Nantucket Island
in Massachusetts.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.708
While searching
colonial-era sites

12:13.833 --> 12:15.833
along the Eastern Seaboard,

12:15.958 --> 12:19.125
she has made numerous historic
and valuable discoveries.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.667
NIKOLINE: Most people think
of a treasure hunter

12:21.792 --> 12:25.250
as someone who is going
out there to get rich

12:25.375 --> 12:26.917
as fast as they can.

12:27.042 --> 12:29.292
For me, treasure hunting
is a little bit different.

12:29.375 --> 12:32.625
For me, treasure is anything
that begins

12:32.750 --> 12:35.667
or continues to tell the story

12:35.750 --> 12:37.750
of the land that it's on--

12:37.875 --> 12:41.125
that can further
our understanding of the past.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.458
Oh, looks like we're here.

12:44.542 --> 12:45.875
Yeah, right over here.

12:48.542 --> 12:52.042
You know, something I've learned
on all these adventures

12:52.208 --> 12:54.542
is that you have to put
the right team together

12:54.667 --> 12:56.125
to have success.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.250
And Nikoline is a great
addition to this team.

12:58.375 --> 13:01.000
She knows her coins,
she knows her precious metals.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.500
And today, we're hopefully
gonna strike gold,

13:03.583 --> 13:05.083
so I'm excited.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.792
Here we go.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.667
-MATTY: Tim.
-What's up, guys?

13:08.750 --> 13:10.250
-Good to meet you in person.
-Good to see you

13:10.375 --> 13:11.417
-not on the computer screen.
-Yeah, Tim Fisher, yeah.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.125
-Ross Fisher.
-Hello.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.708
-Hey, Ross, Matty Blake.
-Nice to meet you, yes, sir.

13:14.875 --> 13:15.625
-Good to meet you.
-Tim, good to meet you guys.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.250
Well, this is incredible.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.583
TIM: Yeah, you won't believe
what you're gonna see

13:18.708 --> 13:20.167
just through those woods, man.

13:20.292 --> 13:21.500
We're gonna look at
some virgin territory here?

13:21.625 --> 13:23.042
-Absolutely.
-Oh, yeah.

13:23.167 --> 13:24.667
It's never been seen by man
in 115, 117 years.

13:24.792 --> 13:26.125
So, we're gonna find
a lot of gold.

13:26.208 --> 13:27.542
If it's there,
we're gonna find it.

13:27.708 --> 13:28.667
-All right, let's get geared up.
-All right.

13:28.750 --> 13:29.542
-We'll see ya.
-Let's go.

13:31.167 --> 13:33.833
MATTY: I'm getting a sense
that both Tim and Ross

13:33.958 --> 13:36.125
are super proud
of what they've built.

13:37.542 --> 13:40.042
-MATTY: Here we go,
hold on tight.
-Awesome.

13:42.167 --> 13:45.417
And they almost can't wait
for us to get into the camp

13:45.542 --> 13:46.917
and see this dredge,

13:47.042 --> 13:48.958
and see exactly what
they've put together.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.750
If I was on vacation
around here,

13:50.875 --> 13:52.708
I would come-- I would pay money
just to do this part.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.708
-Oh, yeah!
-Right?

13:53.875 --> 13:54.917
Totally.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.500
Wow.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.208
MATTY:
Hold on tight.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.792
I think this is it.

14:06.792 --> 14:08.333
Oh, wow, look at that!

14:09.417 --> 14:12.292
-Holy moly!
-NIKOLINE: That is incredible.

14:12.417 --> 14:13.833
TIM: Come on down
and check it out, guys.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.458
Come on aboard, as it were. Heh.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.833
-There you go.
-Wow. Oh, my gosh!

14:21.875 --> 14:23.875
-NIKOLINE: Wow!
-MATTY: Look at that.

14:24.042 --> 14:26.542
TIM: Man, the difficulty
in excavating this dredge

14:26.667 --> 14:28.625
is quite enormous.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.542
Most people would think,
"Man, you're crazy."

14:30.667 --> 14:33.833
In our excavation, we want
to do things the right way.

14:33.958 --> 14:35.958
So, a lot of it
has to be hand-dug, you know.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.417
So, yeah, it's a lot
of time investment

14:39.542 --> 14:41.875
-in this project.
-Yeah, a lot.

14:42.042 --> 14:43.417
TIM: So, we had to do
the crazy thing

14:43.542 --> 14:45.125
of trying to dig this thing up,

14:45.208 --> 14:47.708
as you see how big
this job is gonna be.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.583
All this material
has to be taken out,

14:49.708 --> 14:51.667
and we're doing
most of it with, uh--

14:51.750 --> 14:53.500
you know, we're using
basically shovels.

14:53.625 --> 14:56.458
We've got an excavator,
we've got a couple of backhoes.

14:56.583 --> 14:57.625
And a home-built crane.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.167
TIM: Yeah,
we had to build a crane,

14:59.250 --> 15:01.250
and the reason for that is,

15:01.375 --> 15:03.125
we couldn't reach over
far enough

15:03.250 --> 15:06.292
to pull that material out
without causing a lot of damage.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.042
Is that a refurbishing,
or did you make it old-timey...

15:08.208 --> 15:10.042
No, all homemade, yeah,
our crew did it.

15:10.167 --> 15:12.208
-Scrap metal.
-Yeah, all from scratch.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.833
MATTY: All fabricated,
all with passion, I love it.

15:14.958 --> 15:16.792
You've got to, I mean,
they don't build stuff

15:16.875 --> 15:18.042
to do stuff like this,

15:18.208 --> 15:19.917
'cause who comes
and does this, you know?

15:20.042 --> 15:20.625
MATTY: Right, you gotta
invent it as you go, right?

15:20.708 --> 15:22.375
Absolutely.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.000
MATTY: I gotta tell you,
this crane that I'm looking at

15:24.125 --> 15:25.958
is one of my favorite things
I've ever seen

15:26.042 --> 15:28.167
in all the years
I've been doing this.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.167
This is straight out
of Dan Henskee

15:30.333 --> 15:32.583
working for
Dan Blankenship ingenuity.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.125
I'm-I'm really impressed.

15:34.208 --> 15:37.750
This whole team represents
what people can do

15:37.875 --> 15:40.125
when you have a common goal
and you're committed to it.

15:40.208 --> 15:42.000
So, I need to show you
our next...

15:42.167 --> 15:44.000
(chuckles) ...invention,

15:44.125 --> 15:45.500
or put-together piece that's--

15:45.625 --> 15:47.833
We call it Franken-sluice,
come check it out.

15:47.958 --> 15:49.583
-Did he say Franken-sluice?
-Franken-sluice.

15:49.708 --> 15:51.375
Oh, I'm so in.

15:51.500 --> 15:55.625
Check it out, guys, it's all
very much a Franken-sluice.

15:55.708 --> 15:59.667
As you can see, it's all made
from pieces here and there.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.625
A trash can that we cut in half.

16:01.708 --> 16:03.208
-No way!
-It works!

16:03.333 --> 16:04.958
-Huh!
-That's where
you put your trash.

16:05.042 --> 16:07.875
A light fixture cover,
a windshield wiper motor.

16:08.042 --> 16:10.167
But you know what, it works,
and it's pretty quiet.

16:10.292 --> 16:12.042
It's a stealthy little machine.
I'll show you.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.167
Look, we cranked the pumps up
just to give you an idea.

16:14.292 --> 16:15.833
-Let me get the pumps going.
-(water splashing)

16:15.958 --> 16:16.792
MATTY:
What is this, is this PVC?

16:16.875 --> 16:18.333
-Whoa!
-That's PVC.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.208
Yeah, PVC pipe.
And then, we're gonna spin it.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.167
-Huh!
-MATTY: You guys are awesome.

16:22.292 --> 16:24.208
-NIKOLINE: Brilliant.
-MATTY: Just awesome.

16:26.167 --> 16:27.958
NARRATOR: The dirt and rocks
that are shoveled

16:28.042 --> 16:30.458
into the Franken-sluice
are fed directly

16:30.542 --> 16:33.250
into a rotating trommel,
where they are sorted

16:33.375 --> 16:37.292
according to weight
under a steady stream of water.

16:37.417 --> 16:40.000
Larger rocks and soil
are discarded

16:40.125 --> 16:42.125
out of the end
of the contraption,

16:42.208 --> 16:44.667
while heavier materials,
such as gold,

16:44.833 --> 16:46.000
fall through the grates

16:46.167 --> 16:48.333
and are captured
in the sluice boxes.

16:48.417 --> 16:49.917
Oh! Franken-sluice!
It says it.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.708
(overlapping chatter)

16:51.875 --> 16:53.708
Who came up with the name?
I gotta ask.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.833
-ROSS: Oh, yeah.
-MATTY: Awesome.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.375
I would recommend
trademarking that.

16:57.542 --> 16:59.167
(laughing)

16:59.250 --> 17:02.208
This is an incredibly
ingenious thing they've built

17:02.333 --> 17:05.333
out of literally trashcans
and lighting fixtures.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.125
They don't have
a lot of resources,

17:08.208 --> 17:09.958
and yet they've built
these things

17:10.042 --> 17:12.333
to help them do this
massive undertaking.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.708
Well, uh, I want to see some
gold coming out of this thing.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.167
-Yeah.
-Let's do it.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.958
-All right.
-ROSS: So, the plan for the day

17:18.083 --> 17:20.208
is to start getting
to the lower parts of the ship

17:20.375 --> 17:22.042
we haven't been able
to get into before.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.875
-I'm excited.
-Yeah, me, too.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.417
Crank up old Franken-sluice,

17:25.542 --> 17:27.250
maybe we can find
some shiny in there.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.667
The team is here.
These guys here have been

17:30.833 --> 17:33.833
with me since the beginning,
supported me all through it.

17:33.917 --> 17:36.083
This is Fellowship
of the Dig South.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.542
TIM:
That's right.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.375
All right, Ross,
I guess you and Matty

17:39.500 --> 17:42.875
will be in the dredge getting
the good stuff, I hope,

17:43.042 --> 17:44.500
and seeing what you can find.

17:44.625 --> 17:47.833
Nikoline will be
working up top here

17:47.958 --> 17:49.917
trying to get the pay
into the buckets

17:50.042 --> 17:51.167
so that we can get it
to the wash plant

17:51.333 --> 17:52.792
and we can start
running some material.

17:52.917 --> 17:54.667
Awesome
Let's find some gold.

17:54.792 --> 17:56.042
-Let's.
-Let's do it.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.167
MATTY: So, the strategy now
is to use the crane

18:00.292 --> 18:02.833
to dig out
this targeted area they have

18:02.917 --> 18:04.208
that they've yet to search.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.875
Based on their research,
they feel like

18:06.000 --> 18:07.500
there could be gold
in this area.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.583
So, we're gonna just do
small piles

18:09.708 --> 18:12.208
into that crane barrel,
lift them out,

18:12.375 --> 18:14.375
and start the search that way.

18:14.542 --> 18:16.917
A very targeted,
systematic approach.

18:17.042 --> 18:18.167
Clear.

18:18.292 --> 18:20.458
Yeah, clear.
It's all yours.

18:23.042 --> 18:24.292
TIM:
There she goes.

18:24.417 --> 18:26.250
We need to run
the old Franken-sluice

18:26.375 --> 18:27.333
and see what's in there.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.333
Yeah, let's see what we got.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.708
MATTY: To get my hands on gold
would be really incredible,

18:32.875 --> 18:35.292
because I've been
talking about it

18:35.375 --> 18:37.000
for just about
a decade now, right?

18:37.167 --> 18:38.208
And dreaming about it
since I was a kid

18:38.333 --> 18:39.500
and I read <i>Treasure Island.</i>

18:39.625 --> 18:41.458
Let's fire
this green machine up.

18:41.542 --> 18:45.333
MATTY: So, to see a piece
of gold in the wild,

18:45.458 --> 18:48.458
in a real hunt...
I don't know how I'll react.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.167
Just, uh-- there's a shovel
up there, Frank.

18:51.292 --> 18:52.958
You may just want
to shovel it in kinda easy

18:53.083 --> 18:55.208
and let it run through.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.375
See anything, Ross?
Any metal or anything?

19:00.542 --> 19:03.292
ROSS: Nothing yet.
No big pieces of nugget.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.667
TIM:
See a lot of rock in there.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.167
NIKOLINE:
Yeah.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.500
You know, we're looking
for gold, of course,

19:08.625 --> 19:10.833
we're looking
for any glass objects

19:11.000 --> 19:12.708
that would have been in there.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.917
Um, metal, any type of metal.
And a lot of wood.

19:16.042 --> 19:17.333
He's seeing bits
and pieces of wood

19:17.458 --> 19:19.375
where the ship's just,
you know, decaying,

19:19.500 --> 19:21.000
and you'll see
wood in there, as well.

19:21.083 --> 19:22.375
Yeah.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.625
All right,
I'm gonna shut her off,

19:23.708 --> 19:25.292
and, uh, we'll clean up.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.417
ROSS:
We'll clean it up.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.000
Come on, baby.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.667
-NIKOLINE: Yeah, I know.
-TIM: Yes, siree.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.792
TIM: Yeah, just look and see
if you're seeing anything.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.625
'Cause the sunshine's
in a good spot right now.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.417
Man, I see a lot of
yellow rocks,

19:37.542 --> 19:39.292
-but not-- nothing shiny.
-Yeah, I know, it makes you

19:39.375 --> 19:40.333
-wonder if that's what it is.
-I know, it throws you.

19:40.458 --> 19:41.792
Ooh, how 'bout this?
What's that?

19:41.917 --> 19:43.333
-Where, where, where?
-What's that right there?

19:43.417 --> 19:45.292
-Oh, what's this?
-Show me.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.542
-What is this?
-Is that gold?

19:48.958 --> 19:50.167
NIKOLINE:
Whoa!

19:54.625 --> 19:55.792
MATTY:
What's that right there?

19:55.917 --> 19:57.417
-Oh! What's this?
-Show me.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.375
-What is this?
-You think that's gold?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.917
NIKOLINE:
That's pyrite.

20:01.042 --> 20:02.000
TIM: No, it ain't,
that ain't pyrite.

20:02.125 --> 20:03.167
-Is that gold?
-Yeah, it's gold.

20:03.292 --> 20:04.417
-No way!
-I can't believe it.

20:04.542 --> 20:05.417
Ah!

20:05.542 --> 20:07.917
-Can't believe it.
-(whoops)

20:08.042 --> 20:09.833
NARRATOR: In Nash County,
North Carolina,

20:09.958 --> 20:14.083
while searching an abandoned
19th-century gold mining dredge

20:14.208 --> 20:16.458
on property belonging
to treasure hunters

20:16.542 --> 20:19.833
Tim and Ross Fisher,
Matty Blake has just made

20:19.958 --> 20:21.667
an incredible discovery.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.417
MATTY: The sun hit it
literally just right,

20:23.542 --> 20:25.375
and it shone right in my eye.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.750
-Come on, baby.
-It's big, right?

20:26.875 --> 20:28.000
Come on, baby!

20:28.083 --> 20:29.250
MATTY:
I mean, I lost my mind.

20:29.375 --> 20:32.333
I've never reacted
so emotionally

20:32.458 --> 20:35.500
for something so small, I think,
since maybe my son was born.

20:35.583 --> 20:36.750
TIM: You got good eyesight,
brother.

20:36.875 --> 20:37.833
Come on, baby!

20:37.958 --> 20:39.500
It's an incredible excitement.

20:39.625 --> 20:42.125
I challenge you
to go pan for gold,

20:42.208 --> 20:43.667
and I don't care
if it's that big.

20:43.833 --> 20:45.500
When you find it,
you will freak out like I did.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.667
NIKOLINE:
That's awesome.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.667
That's what they call
foil gold.

20:49.833 --> 20:50.792
-Yeah.
-It's just another form
of a nugget.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.500
It looks like foil, yeah.

20:52.583 --> 20:53.417
-NIKOLINE: It's beautiful.
-ROSS: Exactly what it is.

20:53.542 --> 20:55.000
That's-- that's very rare.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.417
We've been here seven years

20:56.542 --> 20:58.250
and we've never found
foil gold like this.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.417
-Not flat gold, that's right.
-NIKOLINE: Crazy.

21:01.542 --> 21:03.167
-There's gold there,
I mean, no doubt.
-Yes.

21:03.292 --> 21:05.167
And there's probably
a good bit of gold there.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.333
Yeah, we're just scratching
the surface,

21:07.458 --> 21:09.375
so it looks like
good days are ahead.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.833
NIKOLINE:
Let's see if there's more.

21:10.958 --> 21:12.500
Keep looking, yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

21:12.625 --> 21:13.500
NIKOLINE: Yeah,
if there's one, there's many.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.000
MATTY:
Oh, boom, boom!

21:15.167 --> 21:16.667
-NIKOLINE: No way!
-MATTY: I'm telling you.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.500
TIM:
That's crazy, check that out.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.125
Care to add it
to the vial, my friend?

21:20.208 --> 21:21.625
Absolutely.

21:21.708 --> 21:25.125
Spotting gold is always
a warm, fuzzy,

21:25.208 --> 21:27.208
delicious feeling.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.208
-Here's some.
-(cheering)

21:30.333 --> 21:31.708
MATTY:
More gold!

21:31.875 --> 21:33.167
NIKOLINE: Since it was
just the first load

21:33.292 --> 21:35.833
out of the dredge,
it is inevitable

21:36.000 --> 21:37.458
that there'll be more gold.

21:37.583 --> 21:40.667
The question is only
how much more gold?

21:40.833 --> 21:43.125
Look at there,
right there in the pan.

21:43.208 --> 21:44.833
-NIKOLINE: Beautiful.
-TIM: Look at that.

21:44.958 --> 21:46.000
-MATTY: Oh, that looks nice!
-TIM: Doesn't that look good?

21:46.167 --> 21:47.917
NIKOLINE:
Yeah, it does.

21:48.042 --> 21:50.833
That moment right there makes
every single second worth it.

21:50.958 --> 21:53.500
That's why we're doing this.
It's fun, you know?

21:53.625 --> 21:55.708
-Now, let's find some more gold.
-TIM: Yeah, let's do it.

21:55.833 --> 21:58.583
So, you want to roll this
magic carpet up right here.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.958
We need to rinse this thing out
really well.

22:02.042 --> 22:04.167
It's kinda like washing clothes
in the old-timey days.

22:04.292 --> 22:06.667
-MATTY: Yeah.
-All right, next step,

22:06.750 --> 22:08.667
we need to pan out our material.

22:08.750 --> 22:11.333
Just put some in there
like that.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.042
Here's all there is to it,
you just roll it around.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.500
You just keep working it
like this,

22:17.625 --> 22:19.083
and you're getting
that material out.

22:19.208 --> 22:20.500
Now, that gold's gonna stay.

22:20.625 --> 22:21.833
If it's there,
it's gonna be in there.

22:21.958 --> 22:23.667
MATTY: 'Cause it's gonna
be at the bottom anyway.

22:23.833 --> 22:25.333
-It's gonna be at the bottom.
-MATTY: 'Cause it's heavy.

22:25.458 --> 22:25.958
All right, so you're getting
the material out.

22:27.458 --> 22:28.875
TIM:
Watch this.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.792
You can make gold walk
right up this gold pan.

22:30.875 --> 22:32.667
You can hold it up like this,
and if you tap it...

22:32.750 --> 22:34.208
-See it climbing? Look.
-MATTY: Wow, yeah!

22:34.333 --> 22:35.750
-TIM: There's gold right there.
-Boom.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.500
-TIM :Right there.
-NIKOLINE: Oh, I see.

22:37.625 --> 22:39.000
MATTY:
It's like a magic trick.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.292
TIM: It's magic, all right.
Y'all try it out.

22:41.417 --> 22:42.625
-NIKOLINE: I love that.
-We've got gold pans.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.333
-NIKOLINE: Okay, okay.
-Give it a shot.

22:45.708 --> 22:47.167
So, back in the day, they didn't
have plastic, obviously.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.500
They-- what'd they use?

22:48.667 --> 22:49.625
-They had metal pans.
-Metal with...

22:49.750 --> 22:51.458
No ripples in it,
it was all flat.

22:51.583 --> 22:52.792
MATTY:
And they would just
use their skill.

22:52.917 --> 22:54.208
ROSS:
That's right.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.833
MATTY: I had never panned
for gold before,

22:55.958 --> 22:57.833
and it was a little more
complicated than I thought.

22:57.917 --> 22:59.542
TIM: Shake it around
a little bit.

22:59.667 --> 23:00.458
-ROSS: Yeah, don't be scared.
-Don't be scared.

23:00.542 --> 23:01.958
It's gonna get messy.

23:02.083 --> 23:03.833
MATTY: You're using the fact
that the gold

23:03.917 --> 23:06.208
is going to be heavier than
everything else in the pan.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.042
So, the way you move it,
everything else

23:08.167 --> 23:09.708
slowly just silts away.

23:09.833 --> 23:11.458
Here's some.

23:11.583 --> 23:13.292
TIM: Man, that's a nice piece
of gold there.

23:13.375 --> 23:14.833
NIKOLINE: That's a good one,
right?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.042
And what you'll be left with
is that top layer of gold,

23:17.167 --> 23:18.667
and it's beautiful.

23:18.792 --> 23:20.500
TIM:
You see, there it is.

23:20.583 --> 23:22.292
Clean water,
and a clean gold.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.583
-NIKOLINE: Oh, nice!
-MATTY: Wow.

23:23.708 --> 23:25.417
And then,
what's the process now?

23:25.542 --> 23:27.875
You've got the day's yield.
What do you do next?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.667
We collect all the small pieces,
and we just put it all together.

23:30.792 --> 23:33.042
Once we get a decent
amount of gold,

23:33.167 --> 23:34.250
we'll do the smelting.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.375
-You smelt it yourself?
-Yes.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.500
-Wow. Wow.
-TIM: We'll do it ourselves.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.292
We've got a small operation.

23:39.375 --> 23:42.625
So, this, in this pan,
turns into about what?

23:42.708 --> 23:44.625
TIM: Probably bring
$400, $500.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.583
-Somewhere in that neighborhood.
-NIKOLINE: Wow.

23:46.708 --> 23:49.625
And although we worked hard,
we didn't dig that much earth.

23:49.708 --> 23:50.833
We didn't move that much earth,

23:51.000 --> 23:52.500
there's two guys
with two shovels, right?

23:52.583 --> 23:53.500
So, I mean, I assume
you're gonna continue

23:53.667 --> 23:55.958
-in that area.
-Yes.

23:56.042 --> 23:59.500
We're very excited and happy
with the amount of gold

23:59.667 --> 24:01.500
that we found today.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.375
I mean, it lets you know that
you're in the right spot.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.083
Maybe we could say
who's laughing now.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.333
Yeah. (laughing)

24:07.417 --> 24:08.667
What are we gonna do next,
tomorrow?

24:08.792 --> 24:11.042
TIM: Well, we need
to hit the dredge piles,

24:11.167 --> 24:13.417
the stuff that the gold--
they didn't think was in,

24:13.542 --> 24:15.375
like bigger rocks,
went right out the back.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.333
We know they've never
been touched.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.042
-Wow.
-So, what we'll do,

24:20.208 --> 24:22.833
is we'll spread the rocks back
and get some detecting done.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.333
See what you can find.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.375
Set her loose and go
from flakes to nuggets.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.083
I mean, I can't--
we could just-- I could go

24:28.208 --> 24:30.333
right now, and you guys could
just join me in the morning.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.000
-MATTY: All right.
-See you tomorrow.

24:32.083 --> 24:33.208
-She'll be out here all night.
-NIKOLINE: I'm ready.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.375
Thank you guys so much,

24:34.500 --> 24:35.750
and we'll see you
in the morning.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.500
Yeah, we're excited,
we'll show you more.

24:37.667 --> 24:39.292
-MATTY: Let's go.
-Shall we hike back to camp?

24:39.375 --> 24:41.000
-MATTY: Yes, sir.
-TIM: The long walk.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.958
MATTY:
Ooh, my weary bones.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.333
-Hello, Matty Blake.
-RICK: Hey, Matty.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.917
This must be
Nikoline with you.

24:56.042 --> 24:57.542
MATTY:
Hello, fellas.

24:57.667 --> 24:58.625
New face here, as you know.

24:58.708 --> 24:59.958
-Hi.
-Nikoline.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.292
Welcome to the team.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.833
How was your first day
on the hunt

25:02.958 --> 25:04.917
in North Carolina?

25:05.042 --> 25:06.500
I'm so happy to be here.

25:06.583 --> 25:08.625
It's such an honor
to be invited out.

25:08.750 --> 25:11.542
Getting out there,
getting dirty.

25:11.708 --> 25:13.750
By the way,
the dirt here is incredible.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.958
-It's full of gold.
-BOTH: Oh!

25:16.042 --> 25:18.708
-Hey, fellas, I found gold!
-Yeah!

25:18.833 --> 25:19.958
(laughter)

25:20.083 --> 25:22.292
-NIKOLINE: Lots of gold!
-Yes, we did it.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.000
I mean, we finally did it.

25:24.125 --> 25:26.500
And even though
it was just a little piece...

25:26.667 --> 25:29.375
It was a substantial
little piece.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.083
(laughter)

25:31.208 --> 25:33.833
You know, all kidding aside,
guys, it was a thrill.

25:33.917 --> 25:35.500
I can see why there
was a gold rush.

25:35.583 --> 25:36.667
-Mm-hmm.
-I can see why people

25:36.792 --> 25:38.458
get addicted to this.

25:38.542 --> 25:40.667
So, what's the plan
for tomorrow?

25:40.792 --> 25:42.417
Well, I think he wants
to take us

25:42.542 --> 25:44.667
to these dredge piles.

25:44.792 --> 25:46.833
And Tim is incredibly
optimistic.

25:46.958 --> 25:49.917
So, I think tomorrow's
gonna be even better.

25:50.042 --> 25:52.125
Matty Blake knows
what I'm gonna say next.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.250
I always say it to Gary,
Nikoline,

25:54.375 --> 25:55.917
so it's not just to you.

25:56.042 --> 25:58.667
Good job finding stuff.
Now, get back out there

25:58.792 --> 26:00.208
and find some other good stuff.

26:00.333 --> 26:01.917
-You got it.
-RICK: Just as important,

26:02.042 --> 26:04.917
please keep us up-to-date
with whatever you find.

26:05.042 --> 26:07.000
All right, guys,
we'll check in soon.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.542
-NIKOLINE: Bye, guys.
-Bye, thanks.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.542
-MARTY: Take care.
-RICK: Stay tuned.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.458
MATTY: That was
a great first day.

26:16.583 --> 26:19.208
Yes, that was amazing yesterday.

26:19.333 --> 26:20.958
-Finding that gold?
-Yes.

26:21.042 --> 26:23.375
NARRATOR: One day
after discovering gold

26:23.500 --> 26:25.458
on a 19th-century mining dredge

26:25.542 --> 26:27.708
in Nash County,
North Carolina...

26:27.833 --> 26:29.458
MATTY: Hopefully,
today we will find a nugget

26:29.583 --> 26:31.958
-of American history.
-Ooh, I like that.

26:32.042 --> 26:34.875
NARRATOR: ...Matty Blake
and Nikoline Bohr

26:35.000 --> 26:36.750
are heading back
to the property

26:36.875 --> 26:39.625
of treasure hunters
Tim and Ross Fisher

26:39.750 --> 26:42.167
to help them search
for more riches

26:42.333 --> 26:43.583
and historic artifacts.

26:43.708 --> 26:45.000
-What's up, guys?
-What's going on?

26:45.083 --> 26:46.458
Good to see you again.
Glad you're back.

26:46.542 --> 26:47.958
-Good morning.
-So glad to be back.

26:48.042 --> 26:49.333
TIM:
We'll find the big stuff today.

26:49.458 --> 26:50.667
We will be in the dredge piles.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.083
They've never been touched.

26:52.208 --> 26:53.958
-MATTY: That's exciting.
-That's really exciting.

26:54.042 --> 26:55.375
TIM:
Let's get some gold, baby!

26:55.500 --> 26:56.833
-Let's go!
-Yes!

26:58.375 --> 27:01.000
MATTY:
We're coming off a day
of finding gold,

27:01.167 --> 27:02.875
so the energy's
as high as it's been

27:03.042 --> 27:04.458
on anything I've ever been
a part of.

27:04.542 --> 27:05.833
You can just feel
the excitement.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.708
-Hold on tight.
-NIKOLINE: All right.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.750
MATTY:
There could be untold riches

27:10.875 --> 27:12.208
in those piles, no doubt.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.000
TIM:
All right, we're here.

27:16.167 --> 27:17.250
All right.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.083
Check it out, guys.

27:22.042 --> 27:24.083
You know I was telling you
about the tailing piles?

27:24.208 --> 27:26.583
You can look and tell
it's never been touched.

27:26.708 --> 27:28.208
MATTY:
Uh-uh.

27:28.375 --> 27:29.333
-NIKOLINE: It's incredible.
-TIM: If you rake back

27:29.500 --> 27:30.875
anywhere in here, you'll see.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.792
Look at all this rock.
See right there? Look.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.500
-Oh, yeah.
-MATTY: Incredible.

27:34.667 --> 27:35.833
-That all come off the dredge.
-Huh.

27:35.917 --> 27:38.417
-Coarse rocks.
-Nice.

27:38.542 --> 27:40.208
NARRATOR:
More than a century ago,

27:40.375 --> 27:42.542
as the dredge traversed the land

27:42.708 --> 27:45.583
processing soil in order
to filter out gold,

27:45.708 --> 27:48.167
large chunks
of sediment and rocks

27:48.292 --> 27:51.000
were immediately discarded
out of the vessel's back end,

27:51.083 --> 27:54.125
creating piles that were
generally overlooked

27:54.208 --> 27:56.417
when searching
for potential valuables.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.167
MATTY:
What's the plan today?

27:59.292 --> 28:01.500
Uh, I'll get on the backhoe,
we'll move some material back...

28:01.583 --> 28:03.667
-MATTY: Okay.
-...so we can open up
some ground, you know.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.708
-Okay.
-TIM: And like I say, you know,

28:05.833 --> 28:08.500
all these years, 100 years,
it's not been touched, guys.

28:08.625 --> 28:09.833
-Yay.
-This is just like--

28:09.958 --> 28:11.333
just like Christmas,
guys, come on.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.583
-Yes.
-Let's open some presents.

28:12.708 --> 28:13.792
-All right.
-Let's go to digging.

28:15.458 --> 28:17.833
(engine starts)

28:17.958 --> 28:19.708
TIM:
To excavate the dredge pile,

28:19.875 --> 28:21.625
we're gonna be using
a small, compact backhoe

28:21.750 --> 28:25.042
that we've got where we can get
in and out easily and maneuver.

28:25.167 --> 28:27.833
We know that
there's a good possibility

28:27.917 --> 28:29.250
that they're ten feet deep.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.667
So, it looks like, you know,
a lot of rock,

28:31.750 --> 28:33.000
and it's never been touched.

28:33.125 --> 28:35.042
A lot of material,
a lot of opportunity

28:35.167 --> 28:38.333
to find some gold,
some artifacts,

28:38.458 --> 28:40.083
-some pieces of history.
-Yep.

28:44.625 --> 28:45.833
MATTY: He's pretty nifty
with that thing.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.833
Oh, yeah,
he's real good with 'em.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.333
Can we jump in here, or...?

28:51.458 --> 28:53.833
-All you.
-Let's go.

28:53.917 --> 28:56.125
From Nantucket
to North Carolina, here you go.

28:56.208 --> 29:00.000
The plan is to have Nikoline
do a pattern search,

29:00.125 --> 29:02.208
a grid search
with the metal detector.

29:02.333 --> 29:04.167
And there still could be
huge chunks of gold in there,

29:04.250 --> 29:06.167
so hopefully,
if anyone can do it,

29:06.292 --> 29:07.875
it'll be Nikoline.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.833
The more we spread it out,
the easier it's gonna be, right?

29:10.958 --> 29:12.333
TIM: Yes, so we'll
thin it out a little bit...

29:12.500 --> 29:15.167
-Let's look over here.
-See what you can find.

29:15.292 --> 29:16.583
(detector beeping)

29:16.708 --> 29:18.542
NARRATOR:
To search the dredge piles,

29:18.667 --> 29:22.625
Nikoline is using
an XP DEUS metal detector

29:22.750 --> 29:24.583
featuring a specialized coil.

29:24.708 --> 29:27.500
The device will emit
specific tone signals

29:27.667 --> 29:29.958
for ferrous metals,
such as iron,

29:30.083 --> 29:32.625
and non-ferrous ones,
such as gold.

29:32.708 --> 29:33.958
NIKOLINE:
The Deus II,

29:34.083 --> 29:36.083
which is a multi-frequency
detector.

29:36.208 --> 29:39.000
It can just ping on
tiny little pieces of metal,

29:39.125 --> 29:41.208
and it is always on target.

29:41.333 --> 29:43.833
(beeping)

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Oh, do you hear this?

29:46.083 --> 29:48.000
(beeping)

29:48.167 --> 29:50.750
TIM:
Oh, yeah, I can hear it.

29:50.875 --> 29:52.500
Like you're on something.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.875
There you go.
That's solid.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.958
TIM:
All right.

29:57.042 --> 29:59.125
Well, it's definitely
not ferrous.

29:59.250 --> 30:01.375
You got a hit
over there, Nikoline?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.792
-(beeping)
-There it is.

30:03.917 --> 30:05.500
She's definitely onto something.

30:05.583 --> 30:06.708
Yeah.

30:06.833 --> 30:08.708
-(beeping)
-NIKOLINE: Ooh!

30:08.833 --> 30:10.625
-TIM: I sure hear it.
-Yeah.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.958
All right, it--
it sounds solid.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.792
I think-- can we try
panning this?

30:14.875 --> 30:16.708
-Just like...
-Sure.

30:16.875 --> 30:18.875
It's important for us
to save this dirt.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.750
If we're getting some readings
that seem to be promising,

30:21.875 --> 30:23.167
we usually take bags with us,

30:23.292 --> 30:24.833
and we'll just take
that material...

30:24.958 --> 30:26.250
-Right.
-...we'll put it in a bag.

30:26.375 --> 30:28.000
That way, we can pan it
and process it.

30:28.167 --> 30:30.458
-MATTY: Come on, gold.
-NIKOLINE: This is exciting.

30:32.333 --> 30:33.917
The suspense.

30:34.042 --> 30:36.458
What we're gonna do
is get a little water in here.

30:38.542 --> 30:40.333
See the black sand up there?

30:41.875 --> 30:43.333
It's definitely black sand
in there.

30:43.458 --> 30:47.000
NIKOLINE: The black sand
forms alongside the gold,

30:47.125 --> 30:49.875
and it is of a similar weight.

30:50.042 --> 30:51.792
So, when you're panning,

30:51.917 --> 30:55.042
and you begin to get rid
of all that excess dirt

30:55.167 --> 30:58.583
and clay that is in there,
you begin to see the black sand.

30:58.708 --> 31:01.458
So, once you begin to see
that black sand,

31:01.583 --> 31:04.958
you know you are going
to be seeing the gold next.

31:05.042 --> 31:06.458
Let's try this one more time

31:06.542 --> 31:08.208
and get a little bit
of the dirty stuff out.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.250
How 'bout that one right there?

31:15.375 --> 31:16.500
That one looks...

31:18.458 --> 31:20.875
TIM: I believe you're right.
Look right there, the very top.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.292
-See it right there?
-MATTY: Oh, my...

31:23.375 --> 31:24.542
NIKOLINE:
Wow!

31:24.667 --> 31:26.500
-(cheering)
-NIKOLINE: Yay!

31:31.542 --> 31:33.083
-TIM: Good eyesight, girl.
-NIKOLINE: We did it.

31:33.208 --> 31:34.167
Can you see it?
Look right up there at the top.

31:34.292 --> 31:35.750
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-See it?

31:35.875 --> 31:36.958
-ROSS: Yeah, that's gold.
-NIKOLINE: Is it?

31:37.042 --> 31:38.250
-ROSS: Yeah, that's gold.
-NIKOLINE: Yay!

31:38.375 --> 31:39.958
TIM: It's like micro gold,
you know,

31:40.042 --> 31:41.792
it'll be really,
really fine stuff in there.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.167
-That's right, girl!
-Good panning!

31:43.292 --> 31:45.000
-MATTY: Holy moly.
-Yeah.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.500
NARRATOR: In Nash County,
North Carolina,

31:47.667 --> 31:51.667
while searching spoils from
a 19th-century gold dredge,

31:51.792 --> 31:54.125
Matty Blake
and Nikoline Bohr

31:54.208 --> 31:56.167
have just made another
incredible discovery

31:56.292 --> 31:59.750
with local treasure hunters
Tim and Ross Fisher.

31:59.875 --> 32:02.667
This team, in a very short
amount of time,

32:02.792 --> 32:04.917
in two locations
with a very small search,

32:05.042 --> 32:06.958
found gold twice.

32:07.083 --> 32:10.083
So, what are their prospects?
Real good.

32:10.208 --> 32:13.958
So, that also proves that when
they were running the dredge

32:14.083 --> 32:16.375
and getting fine gold
off of there,

32:16.500 --> 32:18.042
-they didn't get it all.
-MATTY: They weren't getting
everything.

32:18.167 --> 32:19.667
-They didn't.
-So, not only the big nuggets,

32:19.833 --> 32:21.333
but any of the fine gold
that did happen

32:21.458 --> 32:22.833
to slip through their cracks,
which, of course,

32:22.958 --> 32:24.833
-some would have to.
-ROSS: Yeah.

32:24.958 --> 32:27.208
TIM:
We're after all the gold,

32:27.333 --> 32:28.833
and we know it's locked
in that clay, some of it.

32:28.958 --> 32:30.042
Gotta be.

32:30.167 --> 32:31.417
ROSS:
We dug a big hole,

32:31.542 --> 32:33.292
but the fact that
we found gold there,

32:33.375 --> 32:36.167
and we only panned
that amount of material?

32:36.250 --> 32:37.875
-MATTY: Right.
-There's gonna be so much more.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.208
I mean, look at
all this land you have.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.875
-Just gotta keep digging.
-That's right.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.250
'Cause like you've said before,

32:42.375 --> 32:43.792
like, the little pieces
add up, right?

32:43.875 --> 32:45.167
When you-- when you smelt them.

32:45.292 --> 32:46.708
That's right.
That little bit of gold

32:46.875 --> 32:49.542
adds up to, like,
a nice chunk of gold.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.208
Could we see that, is that
something we could watch?

32:51.333 --> 32:52.583
-Yeah, I think we should do it.
-Really?

32:52.708 --> 32:53.833
-Let's smelt some gold.
-Yeah.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.333
We've got some,
we've got some

32:55.458 --> 32:57.083
that you guys have caught,
let's measure that.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.333
-I would love to see that.
-I would love to see it.

32:58.458 --> 33:00.000
-Let's do that.
-Let's do it, guys.

33:00.167 --> 33:03.042
MATTY: So, another
successful day, more gold.

33:03.167 --> 33:06.083
So, right now, the plan is,
they're gonna take the gold

33:06.208 --> 33:09.583
that we found and show us
how they turn this fine gold

33:09.708 --> 33:11.500
into something solid.

33:12.708 --> 33:15.417
Check it out, this is some
of y'all's caught gold.

33:15.542 --> 33:16.542
This is so cool.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.000
-There's your gold.
-Wow.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.250
There it was, remember it?

33:19.375 --> 33:21.208
All right,
so what we're gonna do

33:21.333 --> 33:24.208
is put our wonderful gold
right in there.

33:25.292 --> 33:26.667
MATTY:
So, this is the crucible?

33:26.750 --> 33:27.833
-TIM: That's the crucible.
-Okay.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.125
-That's right.
-Geez.

33:29.250 --> 33:30.750
All right, set it in there.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.583
Sure we're not summoning
a spirit or something?

33:33.708 --> 33:35.458
-Look at that.
-Whoa!

33:35.583 --> 33:37.708
TIM: It's gotta get
2,000 degrees.

33:37.875 --> 33:39.208
MATTY: How'd you learn
how to do this?

33:39.333 --> 33:40.542
A lot of trial and error.

33:40.708 --> 33:41.875
-Really?
-Yes.

33:42.042 --> 33:43.458
You guys are awesome.
No, I'm ser--

33:43.542 --> 33:45.625
That's why I ask,
'cause everything you guys do

33:45.750 --> 33:49.542
is homemade, you're finding out
how to do it yourselves,

33:49.667 --> 33:51.542
you're making it yourselves.
I just love it.

33:52.833 --> 33:56.167
These guys are exactly
the type of treasure hunters

33:56.292 --> 33:57.958
we want to align with, you know?

33:58.042 --> 33:59.833
They won't stop.
If they have to build something

33:59.958 --> 34:02.167
out of garden hose,
they'll do it

34:02.292 --> 34:03.792
to make this happen.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.125
And I love that spirit, I do.
I love it.

34:06.208 --> 34:08.000
TIM:
See, it's changing in there.

34:08.083 --> 34:09.917
MATTY: Looks like
it's turning into the sun.

34:10.042 --> 34:11.542
Let's-- let's see
what we got here.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.292
All right, here we go.

34:14.417 --> 34:16.125
See how hot that is?
(laughing)

34:19.375 --> 34:20.708
MATTY: Whoa, look at
the crucible itself.

34:20.833 --> 34:23.125
-TIM: She is red-hot.
-NIKOLINE: Yeah, look out.

34:23.208 --> 34:25.042
-(all exclaiming)
-TIM: You missed it.

34:25.208 --> 34:27.167
-It's okay.
-That's all right.

34:27.250 --> 34:28.708
There's your gold right there.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.125
MATTY:
It's so discolored now.

34:32.250 --> 34:34.458
ROSS: Yes, so now we need
to tap it with a hammer.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.417
TIM:
You chisel off the impurities.

34:37.625 --> 34:38.583
Just like that.

34:41.417 --> 34:43.333
-MATTY: Oh, there it goes.
-TIM: There we go.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.250
-ROSS: (chuckles)
Isn't that something?
-TIM: Put your hand out.

34:45.375 --> 34:48.042
-(sighs) Gold!
-There you go.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.458
-TIM: That's cool, man.
-MATTY: It really is.

34:51.542 --> 34:55.583
I mean, all the work you do,
that is the reward.

34:55.708 --> 34:57.917
And it's awesome
to watch you guys do it.

34:58.042 --> 35:00.667
So, how did it feel
to find that gold,

35:00.792 --> 35:02.125
but then you see it melted?

35:02.208 --> 35:04.000
I think it's just a thrill.

35:04.125 --> 35:05.333
I really do,
I think it's awesome.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.042
Yeah, but we didn't melt
your gold.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.833
-What?
-We saved it.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.208
We couldn't melt
y'all's first gold.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.500
You need to-- let's see here.

35:12.667 --> 35:14.167
-Aw!
-No way. No way.

35:14.250 --> 35:15.750
We couldn't melt
your first pieces you find.

35:15.875 --> 35:17.292
-No way.
-Couldn't do it, guys.
Couldn't do it.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.917
There's the first piece
you found.

35:19.042 --> 35:20.333
-Listen, listen.
-That's so cute.

35:20.417 --> 35:21.708
And there was the piece
that you put in...

35:21.833 --> 35:22.958
-No! Aw!
-There you go, guys.

35:23.083 --> 35:24.917
We couldn't put that
in the fire.

35:25.042 --> 35:26.583
MATTY:
Okay, listen.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.458
-Thank you.
-First of all,
I'm not gonna cry.

35:28.542 --> 35:30.625
'Cause I get emotional
like Rick.

35:32.042 --> 35:33.875
But I am so touched by this.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.667
But I'm gonna--
I'm gonna beg you.

35:36.750 --> 35:40.292
I will take any memento
you want to give me.

35:40.417 --> 35:42.417
Matter of fact,
I want something, I do.

35:42.542 --> 35:43.833
I wanted to bring something
from here to show people

35:43.958 --> 35:45.167
and say I was here.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.625
But I truly want you
to use this.

35:49.417 --> 35:51.167
I want you to use this,
'cause I've been so impressed

35:51.250 --> 35:52.875
by what you guys have done.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.375
I want you to use this to help
fund what you're doing.

35:56.417 --> 35:58.042
You need it.
Your first piece of gold.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.500
You've got to be able
to walk around

35:59.625 --> 36:01.000
and say, "Look here,
look what I found.

36:01.083 --> 36:02.375
-I picked it out."
-That's our gift.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.917
-That's right.
-It means more to us

36:04.042 --> 36:05.458
-that you can keep that.
-We will find more.

36:05.583 --> 36:07.583
-We will find more of that.
-I'm serious, brother.

36:07.708 --> 36:10.042
This is really special.

36:10.167 --> 36:11.667
With the treasure,
I never presume

36:11.792 --> 36:15.083
that I'm gonna get
to keep any of it, ever.

36:15.208 --> 36:17.250
They could use that
and sell that gold,

36:17.375 --> 36:18.917
and use that money
back in their operation,

36:19.042 --> 36:20.375
but they would not have it.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.417
So, to be handed this
and to say,

36:22.542 --> 36:24.542
"Take it, it's yours,"
I mean, that's next-level.

36:24.667 --> 36:28.333
Thank you doesn't seem enough,
but thank you.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.125
-You are certainly welcome.
-Absolutely.

36:30.208 --> 36:31.833
We enjoyed y'all's company.

36:31.917 --> 36:34.208
-Yeah? Can we come back?
-ROSS: Absolutely, please do.

36:34.375 --> 36:35.667
You're welcome back.
Our journey's still going.

36:35.750 --> 36:37.333
You need to come back
to see us, you know.

36:37.458 --> 36:39.000
There's so much more to find.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.417
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.583
-We found the treasure.
-Yeah, we're finding gold,

36:43.708 --> 36:45.167
and it's a process
that keeps growing

36:45.250 --> 36:46.417
-and getting better.
-Yes.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.500
Every day,
there's new stuff being found.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.833
Every day, there's new ideas
of new tools

36:52.917 --> 36:54.292
and machinery being built.

36:54.375 --> 36:56.125
One day, it'll--
a dream can come true.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.333
-Persistence, my friend.
-That's right.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.375
Well, I'm sure you guys
have some work to do, right?

37:00.500 --> 37:02.792
Yeah, we've got to clean our
tools and things to put away.

37:02.917 --> 37:03.958
All right, let's help you.

37:04.042 --> 37:06.583
All right,
let's do it then.

37:06.708 --> 37:08.458
♪ ♪

37:18.750 --> 37:20.625
MATTY: I just could not
get here fast enough.

37:20.708 --> 37:23.042
When I saw that gold,
man, I'll tell you what.

37:23.167 --> 37:24.833
-I lost my mind.
-Really?

37:24.917 --> 37:25.833
I lost my mind.

37:25.917 --> 37:27.042
The lure of gold.

37:27.167 --> 37:28.625
All right, well,
give us details.

37:28.708 --> 37:31.125
We know you found some gold.
What does that mean?

37:31.208 --> 37:32.375
-Well...
-RICK: Oh!

37:32.542 --> 37:33.833
-Top pocket find.
-Top pocket find.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.875
I learned from Gary Drayton
where to keep it.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.333
There you go.

37:40.333 --> 37:43.292
MARTY: Very cool.
Shiny little bugger.

37:43.375 --> 37:45.292
MATTY: And man,
it's a thrill.

37:45.375 --> 37:46.833
-Pretty exciting.
-It's a thrill.

37:46.958 --> 37:48.208
MARTY:
That's not a bad find.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.167
It's a proof of concept,
is what that is.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.417
-Yeah, yeah.
-That's a proof of concept.

37:52.542 --> 37:54.375
So, what do they want to do?
What are they gonna do next?

37:54.500 --> 37:56.625
Well, I actually
have them standing by,

37:56.708 --> 37:59.167
and I think they have
a couple updates, too.

37:59.292 --> 38:00.625
-Okay.
-I know they want to talk to you

38:00.708 --> 38:02.333
for another reason, too,
but I'll--

38:02.500 --> 38:03.458
-I'll let them explain that.
-MARTY: All right.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.792
-Let's do it.
-Okay, right.

38:06.833 --> 38:09.292
-RICK: Hi, guys.
-MARTY: Hey, Tim. Hey, Ross.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.917
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hey, what's up, guys?

38:11.042 --> 38:13.000
Good to see you again.

38:13.167 --> 38:15.250
Well, guys, what an adventure.

38:15.375 --> 38:17.917
My heart is still in
North Carolina with you boys.

38:18.042 --> 38:19.625
What a time, I just--

38:19.708 --> 38:21.792
I could just say
thank you a million times.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.667
Unbelievable experience.

38:23.792 --> 38:25.792
We hated you left,
we wanted you to stay, man.

38:25.875 --> 38:27.667
We had lots to show you.

38:27.750 --> 38:30.167
Well, I also did
a little messenger service,

38:30.292 --> 38:32.292
and I brought
the package with me

38:32.375 --> 38:34.125
from North Carolina
that you asked me to bring.

38:34.208 --> 38:36.458
-Cool!
-Yeah.

38:36.542 --> 38:37.750
-You ready?
-Yes, hell yeah.

38:37.875 --> 38:38.833
Here you go.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.083
From our new friends

38:40.208 --> 38:41.917
-down South.
-Wow!

38:43.042 --> 38:44.542
MARTY:
Geez, didn't expect that.

38:50.208 --> 38:51.833
MATTY:
From our new friends

38:52.000 --> 38:52.875
-down South.
-Wow!

38:53.042 --> 38:53.958
One for each of you.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.542
MARTY:
Wow.

38:57.667 --> 39:00.125
I see a bunch
of gold in here.

39:00.208 --> 39:01.917
Jeez, didn't expect that.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.292
MATTY: And tell them
what it is, fellas.

39:05.417 --> 39:08.625
It is some gold
from our area, off the dredge.

39:09.542 --> 39:11.125
That's authentic, it is real,

39:11.208 --> 39:15.333
as well as a nail
or a spike that they used

39:15.458 --> 39:17.250
to put down the deck boards.

39:17.375 --> 39:18.458
-MARTY: Very cool.
-RICK: Yeah.

39:18.542 --> 39:20.208
And then, there's a cable
off it too?

39:20.333 --> 39:21.542
Is that what I'm looking at?

39:21.667 --> 39:23.333
TIM: Yes.
In a dredge pile,

39:23.500 --> 39:25.417
we saw this cable sticking up.

39:25.542 --> 39:28.042
And so, I thought,
how cool would that be

39:28.167 --> 39:29.583
to give you guys a taste?

39:29.708 --> 39:31.417
RICK:
This is really cool.

39:33.167 --> 39:34.583
You know what, not many people

39:34.708 --> 39:36.000
have one of these,
I'll tell you.

39:36.167 --> 39:38.167
You're right about that.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.417
-(laughter)
-Yeah, I bet I am, I bet I am.

39:40.542 --> 39:43.458
Have you been doing any work
since I left?

39:43.542 --> 39:45.500
Oh, yeah, yeah,
we've done pretty good.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.667
-Every day.
-We always get some--

39:47.792 --> 39:49.583
I don't know if you can
see it or not.

39:49.708 --> 39:51.417
-There's some gold right there.
-Oh, yeah, we can see it.

39:51.542 --> 39:53.000
Just a few little--
a picker and a nugget.

39:53.125 --> 39:56.042
We've got a vial with some gold.
I know it's hard to see,

39:56.208 --> 39:58.208
-but there's gold in there.
-Oh, no.

39:58.333 --> 39:59.792
We're also working
on a wash plant, you know.

39:59.917 --> 40:02.333
We were just getting that
together,

40:02.417 --> 40:04.083
and we will be able
to run more material...

40:04.208 --> 40:05.458
-Faster.
-...faster,

40:05.583 --> 40:08.333
but to also be able
to separate out

40:08.458 --> 40:11.167
any kind of artifacts,
so that we make sure

40:11.292 --> 40:13.500
-we don't miss any.
-Yes.

40:13.667 --> 40:15.583
You didn't retire
Franken-sluice, did you?

40:15.708 --> 40:17.333
(laughs)

40:17.458 --> 40:18.500
We still got old Franken-sluice
put together.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.208
That's all we've got right now,

40:20.333 --> 40:21.917
but we're working
towards bigger things.

40:22.042 --> 40:24.542
-MARTY: All righty.
-We're trying to find anything

40:24.708 --> 40:27.375
that pertain to artifacts
off the dredge.

40:27.542 --> 40:29.333
That's extremely
important to us.

40:29.458 --> 40:32.833
Is there a way that
that could detected...

40:32.917 --> 40:34.542
Other than just
our metal detectors?

40:34.708 --> 40:36.208
-Yeah, just our metal detectors.
-Oh, yeah.

40:36.375 --> 40:38.542
You'd want--
No, you'd want a magnetometer.

40:38.708 --> 40:40.292
And it could detect things
quite deep.

40:40.417 --> 40:41.750
-On a drone?
-Put it on a drone.

40:41.875 --> 40:43.542
-On a drone.
-Oh, wow, that would be cool.

40:43.667 --> 40:45.167
That would be awesome.

40:45.292 --> 40:47.917
You could actually fly the drone
down inside the compartment.

40:48.042 --> 40:49.375
MATTY:
Yes, you could.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.000
We could fix you up
with one, actually.

40:51.125 --> 40:52.375
We got that equipment.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.833
-Wow. Wow, man, that's crazy.
-(laughs)

40:54.958 --> 40:56.458
Awesome.

40:56.542 --> 40:58.625
All righty, it's been fun
interacting with you.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.875
We'd like to get down
and actually maybe drink a beer

41:01.042 --> 41:02.625
or something with you guys,
it'd be really nice.

41:02.750 --> 41:04.333
-Please, come back.
-That'd be awesome.

41:04.417 --> 41:06.292
-Please come back and see us.
-I'm thirsty.

41:06.417 --> 41:09.333
(laughter)

41:09.458 --> 41:11.458
Thank you, guys.
Thank you for everything,

41:11.542 --> 41:13.167
and we'll-we'll be in touch.

41:13.292 --> 41:15.708
-Y'all come back.
-You hear?

41:15.875 --> 41:17.208
-TIM: You hear?
-See ya, take care, guys.

41:17.333 --> 41:18.667
RICK:
Thanks, guys.

41:19.917 --> 41:21.208
-This is really cool.
-That's above and beyond.

41:21.333 --> 41:22.792
-Isn't that nice?
-Yeah.

41:22.917 --> 41:24.708
-They are gentlemen.
-MARTY: Yeah, they are.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.667
I hope the sight
of gold in your hands

41:27.750 --> 41:29.667
inspired you a little bit,
maybe.

41:29.792 --> 41:32.000
Yeah, I'd like to hold
a little bit more in my hands.

41:32.167 --> 41:33.667
-Yeah.
-When do we get to this?

41:33.792 --> 41:35.500
RICK: The inspiration
really comes from...

41:35.625 --> 41:39.708
Look, they took a--
just a dream, an idea,

41:39.833 --> 41:42.083
and look where they sit,
you know?

41:42.208 --> 41:44.208
Yeah, they're having fun, too,
that's great.

41:44.333 --> 41:47.417
It's not just the concept
of what they're trying to do.

41:47.542 --> 41:49.333
It's the fact that
they are both dedicated

41:49.500 --> 41:52.000
-to telling the story.
-Yeah.

41:52.083 --> 41:55.542
Well, let's go find
about 200,000 of these...

41:55.708 --> 41:56.750
-Yeah.
-...right out there.

41:56.875 --> 41:58.375
-All right, Matty Blake.
-Come on.

41:58.542 --> 42:01.250
-Or more.
-The bar is set pretty low.

42:01.375 --> 42:02.833
MATTY:
200 million. (laughs)
