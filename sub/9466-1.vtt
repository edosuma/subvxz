Today's the day.

00:21.553 --> 00:24.457
This is it.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.800
All right guys, I wanna
talk to you about something.

00:31.129 --> 00:32.497
This isn't easy for me,

00:32.531 --> 00:33.799
but I'm...
I'm turning 24 today,

00:33.831 --> 00:35.967
and I think
it's just time

00:36.001 --> 00:37.669
I told you
the truth.

00:39.537 --> 00:40.906
What I mean is...

00:40.939 --> 00:42.975
okay so the thing
is that...

00:59.491 --> 01:01.060
Hey Martha,
how are you?

01:01.092 --> 01:02.560
Adam, I hope
you like blueberries.

01:02.593 --> 01:03.762
Wow. Thanks.

01:03.796 --> 01:05.096
You didn't have to do
all this.

01:05.129 --> 01:06.998
Nonsense.
It was no trouble at all.

01:07.031 --> 01:08.000
It's just leftovers
from church group this week.

01:08.033 --> 01:09.869
Yeah?

01:09.902 --> 01:12.138
It's so nice to have a good
strong man like yourself

01:12.170 --> 01:13.938
-that enjoys my cooking.
-Thank you.

01:13.971 --> 01:15.774
And you're still free
next Saturday, right?

01:15.807 --> 01:17.008
Saturday?

01:17.042 --> 01:18.811
My niece is definitely
coming this time

01:18.843 --> 01:20.512
and I have told her
all about you.

01:20.545 --> 01:21.746
Yeah, about that,
I am actually...

01:21.780 --> 01:22.848
Saturday is not really
good for me.

01:22.881 --> 01:23.949
-You must.
-Okay, but...

01:23.982 --> 01:24.983
-you must.
-Well there's...

01:25.016 --> 01:26.652
-you have to.
-Can i...

01:26.685 --> 01:27.853
-you'll be thrilled to do it.
-You know that's...

01:27.885 --> 01:29.721
it's got to happen,
I tell you.

01:29.754 --> 01:31.756
Wait, did I catch you
at a bad time?

01:31.789 --> 01:33.124
No, it's just,
it's Chris.

01:33.158 --> 01:34.793
He's just,
he's picking me up.

01:34.827 --> 01:36.762
You boys
don't get in any trouble.

01:36.795 --> 01:38.631
Don't do anything
the good lord wouldn't do.

01:38.664 --> 01:40.065
Okay. Thanks.
Thanks for these.

01:40.098 --> 01:41.700
I have to see
Chris. I can't do it.

01:41.733 --> 01:43.102
I've gotta see him.
Hi, Chris.

01:43.134 --> 01:44.636
Hey, Martha.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.638
You have got to bang
your neighbor, man.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.441
It is the least
you can do.

01:48.474 --> 01:50.943
Nah, it's not like
I'm keeping her tupperware.

01:50.976 --> 01:52.178
Besides, she's trying
to set me up with her niece.

01:52.211 --> 01:54.513
Dude, then bang
the frickin' niece, man.

01:54.545 --> 01:55.781
What are you
waiting for?

01:57.248 --> 01:59.018
I don't think
I could do that, man.

01:59.051 --> 02:01.053
-The thing is...
-dude, I don't wanna hear your excuses.

02:01.086 --> 02:02.620
You're too damn
nitpicky.

02:02.653 --> 02:03.923
That's why
you're on a cold streak.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.591
I don't care
how busted this chick is,

02:05.623 --> 02:08.461
give her your dick
and keep the muffins coming.

02:08.493 --> 02:09.661
Yeah.

02:11.596 --> 02:12.998
It's gonna be
an awesome night.

03:47.725 --> 03:49.928
-Just take the shot.
-Another miss.

03:49.962 --> 03:51.297
-Fee-fi...
-You only get two shots dude.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.231
-Fo-fum.
-Yes!

03:53.265 --> 03:55.100
-What's up fuckfaces?
-Get in here, homos.

03:55.132 --> 03:56.668
We leave for the bar
in an hour,

03:56.701 --> 03:58.603
I want you blacked out
by then, all right?

03:58.636 --> 04:00.104
Especially you,
birthday boy.

04:00.137 --> 04:01.172
Yeah.

04:01.206 --> 04:02.941
What's the rush?

04:02.975 --> 04:04.876
That rush is that I
haven't had a Saturday off

04:04.910 --> 04:05.978
in over a month...

04:06.011 --> 04:07.079
Michelle,
or from work?

04:07.112 --> 04:08.814
From both, dude.

04:08.846 --> 04:12.016
And I am going to savor
every minute of it.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.017
By being
hung over all day?

04:13.051 --> 04:14.653
Yeah, of course.

04:14.685 --> 04:16.021
How'd you like that video
we sent you?

04:16.053 --> 04:18.624
Yeah. She was
a real screamer, man.

04:18.656 --> 04:20.726
And then that dude like dropped
a dq blizzard on her face.

04:20.759 --> 04:22.727
Yeah, I could never
finish those.

04:22.761 --> 04:24.162
It was almost as bad as the one
I dropped on ortu's mom's face

04:24.196 --> 04:25.196
last night.

04:26.398 --> 04:28.333
-Hey, watch the eye.
-Domination.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.770
Adam.
You wanna get gay?

04:32.371 --> 04:33.706
What?

04:33.739 --> 04:35.674
You want a shot?

04:35.706 --> 04:37.242
-I'll get gay.
-I'll get gay.

04:37.275 --> 04:39.078
Y... yeah, sure.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.279
Birth-gay.
Birth-gay shots.

04:41.312 --> 04:42.312
Birth-gay shots.

04:44.215 --> 04:45.817
Boys, there are
some good-looking girls

04:45.850 --> 04:46.918
here tonight.

04:46.951 --> 04:47.920
Best of luck
to all of you.

04:47.953 --> 04:48.921
Happy birthday, Adam.

04:48.953 --> 04:50.823
-Cheers.
-To Adam.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.757
-All right.
-So...

04:52.790 --> 04:54.660
Holy tits.

04:57.929 --> 05:00.833
You gotta be fucking
kidding me, dude.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.800
You guys are so lucky you
don't have girlfriends, man.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.035
Look at those bombs.

05:04.069 --> 05:05.203
You just bury
your face in them

05:05.237 --> 05:06.205
and be totally fine
with it.

05:06.237 --> 05:07.305
Yeah, I don't think

05:07.338 --> 05:09.040
she'd be totally fine
with it.

05:09.074 --> 05:10.208
You don't think
they're together, do you?

05:10.242 --> 05:12.378
I think so, man.

05:12.410 --> 05:14.679
I don't think
they're together.

05:16.148 --> 05:17.282
Okay, so... What I
was saying before is...

05:17.314 --> 05:19.218
is she looking?

05:19.251 --> 05:22.787
-No. Look I'm...
-what about now? What about now?

05:22.821 --> 05:24.223
Vascular as hell, bro.

05:24.256 --> 05:26.025
Never mind.

05:26.057 --> 05:27.291
Jeez, man.

05:27.324 --> 05:29.927
-What's going on with you?
-Nothing.

05:29.961 --> 05:31.230
You seem weird.

05:31.263 --> 05:32.343
No. It's...
it's just...

05:34.432 --> 05:37.702
What?

05:37.735 --> 05:39.303
The girl to your right
in the Fanny pack,

05:39.336 --> 05:42.006
she's totally
eye-fucking you.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.175
Yeah, right now.

05:49.114 --> 05:50.249
I'll be right back, boys.

05:54.052 --> 05:56.054
I got a cramp.

05:58.256 --> 06:01.227
Yeah, just a quick...
quick selfie.

06:05.963 --> 06:07.732
Is this Prada?

06:07.766 --> 06:10.102
Yeah.
Actually it is.

06:10.134 --> 06:12.271
It cost like $2,000.

06:12.304 --> 06:14.306
I've never touched anything
that expensive before.

06:14.338 --> 06:15.874
I'm sorry.

06:15.907 --> 06:19.211
My god, you guys.
We need to dance, now.

06:19.244 --> 06:21.412
We need to dance
right now.

06:21.446 --> 06:24.450
We absolutely
do need to dance.

06:24.482 --> 06:27.386
Hey, Adam. You need
to dance. Right now.

06:30.521 --> 06:32.423
I've got a dance partner
for you, right here.

06:32.456 --> 06:33.925
-You do?
-Hi.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.194
Hey, Adam. This is Adam,
my dancing friend.

06:36.227 --> 06:39.098
My god. You're hot.

06:39.131 --> 06:41.300
-You're drunk.
-No, I'm not.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.936
He's great in bed too.
Real giver.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.972
How do you know?

06:47.004 --> 06:49.440
What? You don't sleep
with your best friends?

06:49.473 --> 06:50.975
That's selfish.

06:51.009 --> 06:52.477
-Okay.
-Very selfish. I'm sorry.

06:52.511 --> 06:53.991
Why don't you guys
make out right now?

06:55.446 --> 06:58.516
Okay. We'd love to.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.184
Should we make out right now?

07:00.218 --> 07:01.738
We'll do it, if they
do it kinda thing.

07:02.853 --> 07:04.922
- Ye......
- I'm waiting.

07:04.956 --> 07:07.092
You see the thing is,
we've both been drinking.

07:07.124 --> 07:09.261
-Yeah, we've been drinking so...
-It'd be cheap.

07:09.294 --> 07:10.763
Cheap. Very cheap.

07:10.795 --> 07:12.230
Cheap, if we made out.

07:12.263 --> 07:13.932
I really have to pee.

07:18.403 --> 07:20.272
Fuck yeah.

07:20.304 --> 07:23.509
Hey. Did you just
take a picture of me?

07:26.545 --> 07:27.845
I...

07:27.879 --> 07:29.414
He was...
he was...

07:29.446 --> 07:32.150
Snapping that guy's unibrow.

07:32.184 --> 07:33.886
You think you're
fucking tmz or something,

07:33.919 --> 07:35.854
taking fucking
pictures of me?

07:35.886 --> 07:38.156
I can't tell if he's
surprised or mad.

07:38.189 --> 07:39.992
Hey. You got beef,
we can step outside.

07:40.025 --> 07:41.059
Fuck that,
it's cold outside.

07:41.091 --> 07:42.461
Yeah, man.
Not all of us

07:42.494 --> 07:44.997
wore our favorite
leather jacket to the bar.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.802
I said,
let's step outside.

07:56.908 --> 08:00.045
What's wrong
with you? Come on.

08:00.078 --> 08:01.313
Don't be a pussy.

08:03.114 --> 08:04.116
You can do this.

08:05.516 --> 08:06.552
Dude...

08:07.985 --> 08:09.320
Don't yell
at the little guy.

08:10.554 --> 08:11.824
Just take a breath.

08:12.624 --> 08:14.059
Relax your toes.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.028
It'll come.

08:21.066 --> 08:23.335
So you did take a picture
of my sister's chest.

08:23.367 --> 08:24.903
You let your sister
dress like that?

08:24.936 --> 08:27.072
That's your sister?
What's wrong with you?

08:27.105 --> 08:28.073
Whoa!

08:28.105 --> 08:29.440
Chris!

08:29.473 --> 08:30.975
Chris!

08:31.009 --> 08:32.177
Listen, I know
this isn't the right time,

08:32.210 --> 08:33.544
but...
I wanted to say that...

08:33.578 --> 08:35.145
fuck these chicks,
we gotta go.

08:35.179 --> 08:37.381
Unibrow guy got crazy.
Let's get out of here.

08:37.414 --> 08:38.482
Whoa.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.922
-Okay.
-I'm so sorry.

08:43.953 --> 08:44.922
-My god.
-It's okay. It's okay.

08:44.955 --> 08:46.357
You're fine.

08:46.391 --> 08:47.358
-I'm gonna call you, okay?
-Okay.

08:47.391 --> 08:48.359
-All right.
-See ya.

08:48.392 --> 08:49.427
I'm sorry.

08:49.460 --> 08:50.928
No, don't be sorry.

08:50.962 --> 08:54.199
I scared him away.
I mistreated his friend.

08:54.232 --> 08:55.534
I'm a terrible friend.

09:25.096 --> 09:26.131
Chris.

09:30.635 --> 09:32.504
Chris.

09:32.536 --> 09:35.139
I'm gay.

09:35.173 --> 09:36.942
Okay, man.

09:36.974 --> 09:38.409
No...

09:38.443 --> 09:39.477
I like guys.

09:46.718 --> 09:48.120
I'm gay.

09:50.387 --> 09:52.391
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

09:53.724 --> 09:54.992
You okay?

09:55.025 --> 09:56.160
You all right?

09:56.194 --> 09:59.197
Fuck man.
Yes, yeah. I'm fine.

09:59.229 --> 10:00.498
It's...
that's not you.

10:00.531 --> 10:02.400
It's the excessive
alcohol.

10:02.434 --> 10:03.569
What the hell's going on?

10:05.502 --> 10:08.139
I'm hurt, man.

10:08.173 --> 10:09.508
Adam's gay.

10:13.511 --> 10:15.012
I gotta take a shit.

10:15.045 --> 10:16.714
I... i should
just head out.

10:16.747 --> 10:18.717
-No, no, no, no.
-No, no. It's cool. I'm gonna go.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.019
-It's okay. Let you guys soak it in.
-No, Adam. No, dude.

10:21.051 --> 10:22.587
No... Adam.
Adam, it's fine, man.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.026
What the hell,
is he fucking with us?

10:29.059 --> 10:31.228
Adam can't be gay, the
dude eats steak every day.

10:31.261 --> 10:32.229
He was eating out
Dorothy cuda in the 8th grade.

10:32.262 --> 10:33.564
Dorothy fucking cuda.

10:33.598 --> 10:36.001
I once saw him rebuild
the entire engine

10:36.034 --> 10:37.369
on a '68 mustang.

10:37.401 --> 10:39.403
Was that before
or after he ass-banged you?

10:39.436 --> 10:41.339
Okay. Dude.
Too soon.

10:51.281 --> 10:52.483
I forgot
I didn't drive.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.356
So you're really...

10:57.389 --> 10:58.490
Gay?

11:01.059 --> 11:03.127
Yeah.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.664
-Cool. Cool.
-Cool.

11:05.697 --> 11:08.367
You've had sex
with women before.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.235
You dated Courtney
for a year.

11:10.267 --> 11:12.737
Cried when she broke up
with you.

11:12.771 --> 11:14.673
Yeah.
But that was like,

11:14.705 --> 11:17.074
that was like
two years ago.

11:17.107 --> 11:20.746
I mean, who have
I been with since?

11:20.779 --> 11:23.248
I mean, I just thought you
had really oddly high standards

11:23.280 --> 11:24.482
in women.

11:24.516 --> 11:27.519
I do. They just need
to be dudes.

11:31.055 --> 11:33.257
So...

11:33.290 --> 11:34.693
Why didn't you
tell me before?

11:34.726 --> 11:36.227
Well, I tried to tell
you guys last night.

11:36.261 --> 11:38.097
No man, I mean like,
way the fuck before.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.766
I don't know.

11:42.534 --> 11:45.170
-Your parents know?
-No. God no.

11:45.203 --> 11:48.506
It's hard enough
telling you guys.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.708
Believe me, I wanted
to tell you before.

11:50.742 --> 11:52.743
I wanted to tell you
for, like, ever.

11:52.776 --> 11:54.012
You know?

11:57.649 --> 12:00.519
I didn't want things
to be weird between us.

12:06.256 --> 12:08.760
Hey, nothing's
gonna change, man.

12:08.793 --> 12:10.595
I promise.

12:34.452 --> 12:36.154
What do we even talk
about now?

12:36.186 --> 12:38.122
I just can't believe
you didn't know.

12:38.155 --> 12:39.723
It was so obvious.

12:39.756 --> 12:41.726
-You knew?
-I mean, come on.

12:41.758 --> 12:43.194
He's a good looking guy
and he's never tried

12:43.227 --> 12:44.429
to fuck any
of my friends.

12:44.462 --> 12:46.231
So? That doesn't
mean anything.

12:46.264 --> 12:48.267
My friends are hot.

12:49.467 --> 12:51.203
You know, you should
invite him over

12:51.236 --> 12:53.137
for a threesome.
I'm sure he'd love that.

12:53.138 --> 12:53.771
Sure.

12:53.804 --> 12:55.372
That's
a great idea. Yeah.

12:55.405 --> 12:56.373
Let me call him up
right now.

12:56.406 --> 12:58.142
No, I'm serious.

12:58.175 --> 12:59.677
You know,
he wants you, right?

12:59.710 --> 13:01.645
Shut up.
No, he doesn't want me.

13:01.679 --> 13:02.747
Now, just get hard

13:02.780 --> 13:04.348
because I have
a date tonight.

13:04.381 --> 13:06.351
-Yeah, with who?
-Just some guy.

13:06.383 --> 13:07.651
Why?

13:07.684 --> 13:09.588
-Are you jealous?
-Not at all.

13:09.621 --> 13:11.189
-Should I be?
-Okay, well just take your pants off.

13:11.222 --> 13:12.624
And don't
touch my face,

13:12.656 --> 13:14.626
because I feel like
I'm starting to break out.

13:34.179 --> 13:35.881
Hey Paul.

13:35.914 --> 13:38.583
Dude, I guarantee you a hot-ass
milf drives this thing, man.

13:38.616 --> 13:40.184
For sure.

13:40.218 --> 13:41.285
Actually, you know what?
90,000 miles.

13:41.319 --> 13:42.453
I think
she used to drive it,

13:42.487 --> 13:43.622
now, the daughter
drives it.

13:46.391 --> 13:47.692
Yeah.
Give that a whiff man.

13:47.724 --> 13:50.194
I'm thinking 19.
Strawberry blonde.

13:50.227 --> 13:51.396
Volleyball player maybe.

13:51.429 --> 13:52.530
Take a rip.
Get deep.

13:52.564 --> 13:54.498
Tell me I'm wrong.

13:54.531 --> 13:56.600
Hey, come on. Get back
to work here. Let's go.

13:56.633 --> 13:59.170
Ronnie, we're checking
the fucking mirrors, man.

13:59.203 --> 14:01.338
Let's go,
out of the car.

14:01.372 --> 14:02.607
See, this one's broke.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.641
I'm glad
I checked this one.

14:03.675 --> 14:06.844
This one was
fucked up.

14:08.813 --> 14:10.515
Think he's gonna show?

14:10.548 --> 14:11.816
It's poker night.

14:11.848 --> 14:13.251
He'll be here.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.737
All right, boys.
Last card.

14:39.444 --> 14:40.911
Man, so, Chris,
you ever call

14:40.944 --> 14:41.912
that Fanny pack girl?

14:41.945 --> 14:43.747
No.

14:43.780 --> 14:46.218
What's the matter? Afraid your
fuck buddy's gonna get upset?

14:46.251 --> 14:47.319
Me and Jess
are not buddies.

14:47.352 --> 14:48.386
We don't even
like each other.

14:48.419 --> 14:49.654
So what's
the problem?

14:49.686 --> 14:51.722
I can't remember
that chick's name, dude.

14:51.756 --> 14:53.725
I drunkenly saved it
in my phone like an idiot.

14:53.757 --> 14:54.825
Let me see that.

14:54.858 --> 14:56.098
I'm really good
with this stuff.

14:59.030 --> 15:01.399
-Train.
-Train?

15:01.431 --> 15:05.269
You saved her name
in your phone as "train."

15:05.303 --> 15:06.771
I raise 20.

15:06.804 --> 15:08.473
Damn it, if you didn't
get that ten on the river,

15:08.506 --> 15:10.275
I could've sucked you dry.

15:11.976 --> 15:13.545
Yeah.

15:17.381 --> 15:18.550
Hey. Can I see
your phone?

15:24.054 --> 15:25.290
Sucked it dry.

15:25.323 --> 15:26.558
All right, boys.

15:26.591 --> 15:27.693
Daddy's all in.

15:28.760 --> 15:29.795
Let's see
what you got.

15:36.668 --> 15:37.803
Stop that.

15:39.036 --> 15:41.272
Cut it out, man.
Come on, stop.

15:41.305 --> 15:42.641
-Stop, just...
-what?

15:42.674 --> 15:43.808
But dude, cut it out!

15:43.841 --> 15:45.244
I got two eights.
Okay?

15:46.877 --> 15:48.912
I call.

15:48.945 --> 15:50.581
Aw, damn.

15:50.615 --> 15:51.850
Fuck this.

15:51.882 --> 15:53.785
That's probably Tracy...

15:53.818 --> 15:56.855
well, if it starts t-r-a,
it's you know,

15:56.887 --> 15:58.589
probably Tracy, right?

15:58.622 --> 15:59.891
Yeah.

15:59.924 --> 16:02.294
Yeah, I could see her
being a Tracy.

16:03.694 --> 16:05.696
Yeah.

16:10.535 --> 16:11.703
Okay, I'm gonna head out.

16:11.736 --> 16:14.639
I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

16:14.671 --> 16:15.873
Tomorrow?

16:15.906 --> 16:17.841
Yeah, you guys
are gonna come over

16:17.875 --> 16:19.878
for the hockey
playoffs, right?

16:19.910 --> 16:22.613
Yeah. Yeah,
see you then, man.

16:22.646 --> 16:23.681
Cool.

16:25.550 --> 16:29.353
Okay.

16:29.386 --> 16:30.789
He definitely wants
to fuck me.

16:30.822 --> 16:33.958
This is all your fault.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.428
My fault?

16:36.460 --> 16:39.363
Yeah, with
your Saint gay rom, and edm.

16:39.396 --> 16:41.366
You're the one
who turned Adam gay.

16:41.399 --> 16:43.768
Are you fucking serious?

16:43.800 --> 16:46.036
You're the one who goes to all
these Taylor swift concerts.

16:46.069 --> 16:48.640
First of all,
t-swift is a singing angel.

16:48.673 --> 16:51.409
Mister skinny jeans
and ladies' deodorant.

16:51.442 --> 16:53.578
I've got sensitive underarms.
It's not a secret.

16:53.611 --> 16:55.713
Yeah, that's right. You do
take bubble baths with the...

16:55.747 --> 16:57.082
dude, you're the one who
dragged us to see "les mis."

16:57.115 --> 16:59.017
Fuck you, man.
"Les mis" is a classic.

16:59.050 --> 17:00.551
-Why don't you tweet about it?
-You don't have time to tweet

17:00.584 --> 17:02.052
'cause you're too busy
sucking Adam dry.

17:02.085 --> 17:03.053
You were the one
eye-fucking him all night.

17:03.087 --> 17:04.588
Okay, he was eye-fucking me.

17:04.621 --> 17:06.089
That's not
what I saw, gaylord.

17:06.124 --> 17:07.826
You're full of it.
I'm not a gaylord.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.660
I own a fantasy football team
and I like "die hard."

17:09.694 --> 17:11.627
Hey guys.
Guys, stop. Stop.

17:11.662 --> 17:14.031
We shouldn't blame anybody.
He was obviously born gay.

17:14.065 --> 17:15.767
No, no.
It's fine guys.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.036
Okay? I'll take the fall
on this one.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.105
He... I'm too good looking.

17:20.137 --> 17:21.704
No, it's nobody's fault.

17:21.739 --> 17:23.540
Because there's
nothing wrong with him.

17:23.573 --> 17:24.775
He's the same guy, right?

17:30.848 --> 17:31.982
Right?

17:38.021 --> 17:39.590
Another play by Stafford.

17:39.624 --> 17:41.459
Perfect getting by him.

17:41.492 --> 17:43.661
Myers PASSES UP THE WING
TO McGinn,

17:43.694 --> 17:46.063
turns inside, gets slammed
into the board side wall.

17:46.097 --> 17:48.165
30 seconds left to go
on the power play down.

17:48.198 --> 17:51.034
Great start
so far by the sabres.

17:51.068 --> 17:53.570
Boyle to Casey.
Pushes it up the ice.

17:53.604 --> 17:56.074
LOOKS FOR McGinn,
TAKEN AWAY BY Smith.

17:56.107 --> 17:57.876
Goal, rangers!

17:57.908 --> 18:00.011
And the game
is all tied up.

18:01.111 --> 18:03.447
The rangers time
of backing it in

18:03.481 --> 18:05.384
and the game
is all tied up.

18:06.951 --> 18:08.587
Can someone just say
something, please?

18:13.124 --> 18:14.526
So...

18:14.559 --> 18:17.796
You really like
the cock?

18:17.828 --> 18:19.030
As much as you
like strippers.

18:20.697 --> 18:21.932
No one
can be that gay.

18:23.201 --> 18:24.169
-Sorry.
-No, it's fine.

18:24.202 --> 18:25.670
Just say it, please.

18:25.703 --> 18:27.472
I know you guys
don't mean anything by it.

18:27.504 --> 18:29.706
You guys have been saying
shit like that for years.

18:29.740 --> 18:30.809
You sure?

18:30.841 --> 18:32.209
Yeah.

18:32.242 --> 18:33.578
No one
can be that gay.

18:34.611 --> 18:36.580
Yeah.

18:36.614 --> 18:37.816
Gay.

18:37.848 --> 18:40.117
-Gay.
-Gay.

18:41.751 --> 18:42.854
It's empowering.

18:46.957 --> 18:48.893
Coming.

18:58.869 --> 19:00.003
My god.

19:00.037 --> 19:01.940
You guys watching
porn again?

19:01.973 --> 19:03.741
-Holy fuck.
-Yeah, I know.

19:03.773 --> 19:06.777
For a gay dude, he sure
can't take a goddamn picture.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.045
Dudemingle?

19:12.817 --> 19:15.654
"Hey cutie, can't wait
for tomorrow night"?

19:17.021 --> 19:18.155
Think they banged?

19:18.188 --> 19:19.590
I mean, I'd fuck this guy.

19:19.624 --> 19:20.791
Put it away,
Adam's coming...

19:20.825 --> 19:22.594
yeah, on bradstar's
lower back.

19:22.626 --> 19:23.927
Good one.

19:25.863 --> 19:27.632
-Icing.
-Aw, come on.

19:27.665 --> 19:29.701
You... you can't blow
the whistle that quick.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.002
So fucking gay...
No offense, Adam.

19:33.303 --> 19:35.739
No offense for what?

19:35.772 --> 19:38.076
Well you said something
about the gays.

19:38.108 --> 19:40.011
And then
you apologized to Adam.

19:42.213 --> 19:45.750
Yeah. Adam doesn't like when we
use profanity in his house, Martha.

19:45.782 --> 19:49.186
He cannot stand that shit.
Sorry, Adam.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.922
-No offense, Adam.
-Sorry, buddy.

19:50.954 --> 19:53.758
I... i had no idea
he was so pious.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.894
I'm gonna take him
to my church group sometime.

19:55.926 --> 19:57.661
What is this?

19:57.694 --> 19:59.196
I wouldn't try to...
the battery's dead.

19:59.230 --> 20:00.964
I think my niece has one.

20:00.998 --> 20:02.634
It's neat.

20:02.666 --> 20:03.667
I can...

20:05.970 --> 20:07.305
-yeah, I'll take that.
-Thanks Martha.

20:07.338 --> 20:08.839
It was really great.
Appreciate it.

20:10.273 --> 20:13.143
You all right?

20:13.176 --> 20:15.213
Yeah, I cleaned it for you.
It's all clean now.

20:15.245 --> 20:17.080
No, nothing. I just feel
a little faint, that's all.

20:17.114 --> 20:18.883
I think I'm gonna
go lay down.

20:18.915 --> 20:20.184
You know,
it's getting late.

20:20.216 --> 20:21.652
Decent people lay down
when it's late.

20:21.685 --> 20:23.620
Okay.

20:23.654 --> 20:25.656
Decent,
that's what I'm doing,

20:25.690 --> 20:28.993
'cause I'm decent.

20:29.026 --> 20:30.262
What?

20:36.067 --> 20:37.035
Menopause, man.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.735
It's a bitch.

20:38.769 --> 20:40.805
My mom slapped a kid
at Macy's once.

21:15.673 --> 21:16.808
Hey. Sorry.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.343
"Ghostbusters"
was on.

21:19.376 --> 21:21.678
Totally lost track
of time.

21:21.712 --> 21:22.747
Okay.

21:24.682 --> 21:25.884
All right.

21:27.251 --> 21:31.155
So, Brad...

21:31.187 --> 21:33.023
When did you take
that profile picture?

21:38.128 --> 21:40.063
I'm sorry.
That's not me.

21:41.398 --> 21:43.367
It's a little dishonest.
Blah.

21:43.401 --> 21:46.838
You know, but I felt like we
had this real connection online.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.640
And I didn't wanna run the risk
of not getting to know you better,

21:49.674 --> 21:51.276
'cause of something
as shallow as looks.

21:52.409 --> 21:53.877
Right?

21:53.911 --> 21:55.080
You're not shallow
are you?

21:57.114 --> 21:59.217
So, how's your friend
feeling?

21:59.250 --> 22:01.019
-Kim.
-Yeah.

22:01.051 --> 22:02.853
She said she's never
drinking again.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.054
-Never?
-Yeah.

22:04.088 --> 22:06.290
Wow. So...
Friday, then?

22:06.322 --> 22:07.758
Yeah, probably,
Thursday.

22:07.791 --> 22:09.660
Probably Thursday.
Okay.

22:09.694 --> 22:12.195
Actually on Thursday
it's karaoke night

22:12.229 --> 22:13.229
at the rail.

22:14.231 --> 22:15.199
You should come.

22:15.232 --> 22:16.667
-I should.
-Yeah.

22:16.701 --> 22:18.703
And bring your friend.
Adam, was it?

22:18.735 --> 22:19.870
Yeah, it was.

22:19.904 --> 22:22.106
Are you inviting me
on a date?

22:22.138 --> 22:24.308
Yeah, like a...
like a group...

22:24.340 --> 22:25.876
-A group gathering.
-It's fun.

22:25.909 --> 22:29.312
Yeah, it will be fun.
I would love to go.

22:29.346 --> 22:33.184
I don't think that Adam
and Kim are gonna work.

22:33.216 --> 22:34.351
Why? 'Cause she puked
everywhere?

22:34.385 --> 22:35.854
No.

22:37.053 --> 22:38.188
He's gay.

22:38.222 --> 22:39.723
-He's gay?
-Yeah.

22:39.757 --> 22:41.392
-Are you serious?
-He's gay.

22:41.425 --> 22:43.860
So, the two of you actually
have slept together then?

22:43.894 --> 22:45.029
No, that was a joke.

22:45.061 --> 22:46.697
I didn't even know
that he was gay,

22:46.731 --> 22:48.833
until he woke me up
and told me

22:48.866 --> 22:50.268
the next morning.

22:51.299 --> 22:52.299
Were you
in bed together?

22:54.003 --> 22:55.205
This is going great.

22:55.239 --> 22:56.340
-Yeah, it's...
-i love this place.

22:56.373 --> 22:58.309
It's cool.

22:58.341 --> 23:00.078
-I got this.
-No, we can split it.

23:00.110 --> 23:03.313
No, you can make
it up to me later.

23:03.347 --> 23:04.749
Now what do you say
we get out of here

23:04.781 --> 23:06.250
and head back
to my place?

23:06.282 --> 23:08.185
You're gonna
love my basement.

23:08.219 --> 23:12.023
I got it totally pimped out.
Xbox 360.

23:12.056 --> 23:14.992
Have you ever heard huey
Lewis and the news on vinyl?

23:15.024 --> 23:16.493
You wanna take me
to your basement?

23:16.527 --> 23:17.828
It'd be fun.

23:17.861 --> 23:19.162
Did you want
one of these?

23:19.195 --> 23:20.464
It's all right,
it's ropex.

23:20.498 --> 23:22.033
It's really great
for, you know...

23:24.401 --> 23:26.170
It's made me feel
so uncomfortable,

23:26.203 --> 23:28.740
like having a gay guy around
it's makes all us feel...

23:28.772 --> 23:31.375
my god.
What is wrong with you?

23:31.407 --> 23:32.097
What do you mean?

23:32.098 --> 23:33.477
Your friend just came
out of the closet.

23:33.511 --> 23:35.245
Do you have any idea
how hard that is?

23:35.279 --> 23:38.148
Yeah. It's been
very hard.

23:38.182 --> 23:39.349
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

23:39.383 --> 23:43.488
No. Not for you.
For him, you moron.

23:43.521 --> 23:44.789
My god.

23:44.821 --> 23:46.857
Your best friend
just told you

23:46.890 --> 23:48.525
how his life
is gonna change forever.

23:48.559 --> 23:49.961
And all you're
concerned about

23:49.993 --> 23:51.762
is how it made
poker night awkward.

23:52.963 --> 23:55.066
Well, and the hockey game.

23:55.098 --> 23:57.835
I'm kidding. Let's...
let's change the subject.

23:57.867 --> 23:59.104
These mojitos
are really good.

24:02.906 --> 24:04.141
I know what
you're thinking,

24:04.175 --> 24:06.210
a basement.
Real romantic, right?

24:07.478 --> 24:09.347
I'm telling you,
it's totally discreet.

24:09.379 --> 24:11.415
Not even my wife
is allowed down there.

24:11.447 --> 24:13.050
Shit, man, that's...
that's awesome.

24:13.082 --> 24:14.985
I would love to.
But I just...

24:15.019 --> 24:17.221
I have to go
water my plants.

24:17.253 --> 24:18.356
Water your plants?

24:18.388 --> 24:20.257
How does that one go?

24:20.290 --> 24:22.859
You tilt your head
to the side.

24:22.893 --> 24:23.861
-Okay.
-Yeah.

24:23.894 --> 24:24.996
Keep your eyes shut.

24:25.029 --> 24:26.765
And then...

24:28.232 --> 24:29.768
And then what?

24:31.601 --> 24:34.070
So how was your date
last night?

24:34.104 --> 24:36.107
Aw, dude.

24:36.139 --> 24:37.307
Long story short,

24:37.340 --> 24:39.242
Tracy thinks
I'm a giant asshole.

24:39.276 --> 24:42.113
Man. I thought girls
liked giant assholes.

24:42.146 --> 24:44.415
Not this one, man,
she is different.

24:51.521 --> 24:53.491
Adam, are you good?

24:53.523 --> 24:54.958
Are you happy?

24:54.992 --> 24:56.994
Yeah.
I guess so.

24:58.361 --> 25:00.864
I figured.

25:00.897 --> 25:02.867
You seem happy.

25:02.899 --> 25:04.835
I told you that nothing
was gonna change...

25:04.868 --> 25:06.470
you guys are trying.

25:06.502 --> 25:08.973
Appreciate it.

25:09.005 --> 25:11.125
You know, things could've
been a lot worse with Tracy.

25:11.608 --> 25:12.577
I doubt it.

25:12.609 --> 25:13.844
-Really?
-Yeah.

25:13.877 --> 25:16.047
Was she 45,
and married?

25:16.079 --> 25:17.348
Did she want to take you
to her basement

25:17.380 --> 25:19.015
and make you
her sex slave?

25:19.049 --> 25:20.218
What?

25:20.251 --> 25:21.219
Dude, what happened
to you?

25:21.251 --> 25:23.620
Nothing happened.

25:23.654 --> 25:25.022
At least you have
Jess, I mean...

25:26.357 --> 25:28.259
I just want someone.

25:28.291 --> 25:29.359
What are you talking
about, man?

25:29.393 --> 25:30.928
You're a good
looking guy,

25:30.961 --> 25:34.132
I'm sure you've broken
a million guys' hearts.

25:36.599 --> 25:38.301
Not really.

25:38.335 --> 25:39.403
I mean, Scott lombardi,

25:39.435 --> 25:42.039
but that was
six years ago.

25:42.071 --> 25:43.875
-Scott lombardi?
-Yeah.

25:43.907 --> 25:46.610
No. When you were
helping him fix his Camaro?

25:46.644 --> 25:49.413
Yeah...
Yeah... yeah.

25:49.445 --> 25:51.482
Wow.

25:53.550 --> 25:55.019
Yeah,
but that was high school.

25:56.287 --> 25:57.454
I mean, think about
how many girls

25:57.488 --> 25:58.990
you guys have been with
since then.

26:03.527 --> 26:05.630
Yeah.

26:06.996 --> 26:09.599
We need
to cheer him up, guys.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.168
He's not happy.

26:11.201 --> 26:13.570
I don't think
he's been happy for a while.

26:13.604 --> 26:15.573
Okay, well... I'm still
not gonna let him fuck me.

26:15.606 --> 26:17.508
Nick. Nobody wants
to fuck you.

26:17.540 --> 26:18.675
You're just...
now you're being a liar.

26:18.709 --> 26:22.013
Guys, can we take
this seriously?

26:22.046 --> 26:23.247
I mean,
do you have any idea

26:23.280 --> 26:26.283
what a depressed gay man
is capable of?

26:26.317 --> 26:28.051
Writing a shitty emo song.

26:28.085 --> 26:29.186
Winning a Tony.

26:29.219 --> 26:30.421
Yeah, true.

26:30.453 --> 26:32.056
But loneliness sucks.

26:32.088 --> 26:33.491
I mean, what if Nick
was lonely?

26:33.523 --> 26:36.359
If hypothetically, Nick
was a sad, lonely person...

26:36.393 --> 26:36.935
yeah.

26:36.936 --> 26:38.562
'Cause he pushes people
away with his anger.

26:38.595 --> 26:42.500
Fuck you, man. I'm... i plowed
three and half girls this last month.

26:42.532 --> 26:43.734
It's more than you
plowed in the last...

26:43.735 --> 26:44.135
Half?

26:44.167 --> 26:46.337
Okay, but Adam
is a real person...

26:46.369 --> 26:47.570
Fuck you guys,
I've got feelings.

26:47.604 --> 26:49.507
Well, then prove it.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.943
Instead of turning everything
into a fucking "your mom" joke.

26:54.078 --> 26:56.146
Okay. What do you want
us to do?

26:57.380 --> 26:58.515
Yeah, there's like...
there's like a...

26:58.549 --> 27:00.318
the grinding kind of noise.

27:00.350 --> 27:02.152
Yeah, it's...
it's the head gasket.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.486
It's definitely
the head gasket.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.388
Yeah. That's what
I thought it was.

27:05.422 --> 27:07.582
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fucking with
you. Just change your oil.

27:09.592 --> 27:13.163
Hey, can i...
Can I ask you a question?

27:13.196 --> 27:15.265
Yeah.
What's up?

27:20.636 --> 27:22.139
What's power bottom?

27:25.075 --> 27:27.211
Do you really
wanna know?

27:27.243 --> 27:29.547
-Yeah.
-No, no. Fuck it. I can't.

27:29.579 --> 27:31.448
You're just gonna make
a bunch of ass jokes.

27:37.021 --> 27:38.455
So, you read
any good books lately?

27:38.489 --> 27:39.490
Any literature?

27:42.526 --> 27:44.195
Yeah.

27:44.228 --> 27:46.597
I mean I read
an article about Kinsey.

27:46.629 --> 27:48.198
Pretty good.

27:48.232 --> 27:50.001
What's... what's Kinsey?
What's Kinsey?

27:50.033 --> 27:53.436
He's a sex scientist.
Never heard of him?

27:53.470 --> 27:54.637
No.

27:54.671 --> 27:56.007
You want me
to send it to you?

27:56.040 --> 27:58.675
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be...

27:58.709 --> 28:00.544
Yeah, I wanna... Yeah I'd
really love to read that.

28:00.577 --> 28:02.346
What don't you understand?

28:02.378 --> 28:04.514
-You just swipe right if they're hot.
-Okay.

28:04.548 --> 28:06.784
You swipe left
if they're busted.

28:06.817 --> 28:08.319
All right,
and then what?

28:08.351 --> 28:10.453
Then you send them
a message. Simple.

28:10.486 --> 28:12.322
And there's
always grindr too.

28:12.356 --> 28:14.125
Yeah, but that's only if you
want to try to have butt-sex

28:14.157 --> 28:15.292
like five minutes
from now.

28:16.527 --> 28:17.728
The fuck is grindr?

28:17.761 --> 28:19.129
How do you know
what grindr is?

28:19.163 --> 28:20.431
How do you know
what grindr is?

28:23.599 --> 28:26.069
Okay, I don't... i just don't
think that apps are gonna work.

28:26.103 --> 28:28.072
Well, you have to give it
a chance, man.

28:28.105 --> 28:29.339
Put yourself out there.

28:29.373 --> 28:31.107
Flirt with them,
but play hard to get.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.342
Let them know
that you're into them,

28:32.376 --> 28:33.610
but make sure
you don't text last.

28:33.644 --> 28:35.146
Yeah, no, that's easy
for you guys.

28:35.178 --> 28:37.280
I have to walk up to a guy,
and wonder like,

28:37.313 --> 28:39.082
am I gonna
get punched in the face?

28:39.116 --> 28:41.085
And you guys can just walk
up to any girl you want.

28:41.117 --> 28:43.319
Yeah, but then we have
to hang out with girls.

28:43.353 --> 28:45.322
Just once, I'd like to go out
to a nice dinner and a movie

28:45.355 --> 28:46.589
and not have to hold in
a fart the whole time.

28:46.623 --> 28:48.726
You fart around Michelle
all the time.

28:48.759 --> 28:51.628
Well it took two years of farting
in a tupperware to get to that point.

28:51.662 --> 28:53.197
So gross.

28:53.230 --> 28:54.565
Ortu's right, man.

28:54.598 --> 28:57.600
As a gay man, you have
the ultimate advantage.

28:57.634 --> 28:58.803
You're a fucking dude.

28:58.836 --> 29:00.503
It's easy
to get another guy

29:00.537 --> 29:02.506
'cause you know exactly
what dudes like to do.

29:02.539 --> 29:03.607
Yeah.

29:04.875 --> 29:06.109
Yeah. Right?

29:06.143 --> 29:07.211
Go with your instincts.

29:08.444 --> 29:09.746
What do guys do again?

30:22.185 --> 30:23.287
-It's a nice place.
-Yeah, yeah.

30:23.319 --> 30:24.754
It's good.

30:24.788 --> 30:26.824
So, your tinder profile
said that "scarface"

30:26.857 --> 30:28.224
is your favorite movie?

30:28.258 --> 30:29.927
Yeah. Yeah, it's one
of my favorites.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.929
Fucking right on, bro.

30:31.962 --> 30:33.564
I hate these queers
who think that being gay

30:33.597 --> 30:35.398
is an excuse
to have no balls.

30:35.432 --> 30:37.800
I'm gay, but I love
"scarface."

30:37.834 --> 30:39.436
-Yeah.
-No.

30:39.469 --> 30:40.638
I fucking
live it.

30:42.673 --> 30:43.941
This was
a terrible idea.

30:43.973 --> 30:45.242
I mean,
don't you feel it?

30:45.274 --> 30:47.578
Everyone is
staring at us.

30:47.610 --> 30:50.514
I don't see
anybody staring at us.

30:55.685 --> 30:57.254
Just take a picture,
why don't ya?

30:58.555 --> 30:59.623
It's like
she's never seen

30:59.655 --> 31:01.357
two guys share
a meal together.

31:01.390 --> 31:02.926
It's like,
sharing a meal.

31:06.530 --> 31:08.898
-Tony would've hated this place.
-I'm sorry, who?

31:08.932 --> 31:10.334
Tony, my ex-boyfriend.

31:11.401 --> 31:13.237
So dark,
and so mysterious.

31:13.270 --> 31:14.637
Yet, still real.

31:14.671 --> 31:16.240
I don't even know
why we broke up.

31:16.272 --> 31:17.440
Can't imagine why.

31:17.473 --> 31:20.277
"Say hello
to my little friend."

31:21.845 --> 31:23.380
You like that?
You think you're so tough?

31:23.413 --> 31:24.582
She's looking
at me over there.

31:24.615 --> 31:26.217
-Yeah.
-She doesn't like that one.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.352
I... no, no, no, no. Sorry.
Nothing against you.

31:28.385 --> 31:30.345
We're just doing "scarface."
First date over here.

31:31.254 --> 31:32.889
You want one
of my French fries, bro?

31:32.923 --> 31:35.226
It's just like a little
phase that I'm going through.

31:35.259 --> 31:37.228
I do a lot of girls too.

31:37.261 --> 31:38.695
-Yeah...
-So...

31:38.729 --> 31:40.297
you look
like you would.

31:40.329 --> 31:41.732
Thanks.

31:41.764 --> 31:44.534
He had the most
fantastic cock.

31:46.302 --> 31:47.304
Well he did.

31:48.704 --> 31:49.973
It was this big.

31:52.541 --> 31:53.711
I don't really know
what I'm gonna get.

31:53.743 --> 31:56.012
I'm probably just gonna
get a beer.

31:56.046 --> 31:57.881
Yeah, so many choices.
I think me too.

32:03.787 --> 32:07.691
So your profile says
you're into gardening.

32:07.723 --> 32:09.425
Yeah.

32:09.459 --> 32:12.029
Yeah, it's just something
I used to do with my mom.

32:12.061 --> 32:13.296
I should probably know
what these are,

32:13.329 --> 32:14.365
but I have no clue.

32:14.397 --> 32:16.899
I definitely don't.

32:16.933 --> 32:18.402
You know,
I always wanted to try that

32:18.434 --> 32:20.771
but everyone says
it's for old people.

32:20.803 --> 32:22.204
Yeah, I don't know
why everyone says that.

32:22.205 --> 32:22.905
Yeah, I don't get it.

32:22.938 --> 32:25.508
Yeah I mean, I'm 24, but I
don't have to wait until I retire

32:25.541 --> 32:27.877
to get fresh
vine ripened tomatoes.

32:27.911 --> 32:28.879
You know?

32:28.912 --> 32:33.851
I want them now.

32:33.884 --> 32:35.685
You wanna
get nachos?

32:35.719 --> 32:37.621
Yeah.
I'd love some.

33:23.867 --> 33:26.036
Two nacho platters
on a first date.

33:26.069 --> 33:27.037
What were you thinking?

33:27.069 --> 33:28.504
First nice guy I meet,

33:28.538 --> 33:30.341
and I almost make him
pass out.

33:30.374 --> 33:32.041
Fuck that arrogant
prick, man.

33:32.075 --> 33:33.711
He's not nice.

33:33.743 --> 33:36.413
If you can't enjoy the smell
of another man's farts,

33:36.445 --> 33:39.449
then you don't want
to know that man.

33:39.482 --> 33:40.684
It's not that big
of a deal.

33:40.716 --> 33:42.585
It's just my parents,
they...

33:42.618 --> 33:43.619
They smelled it too?

33:43.653 --> 33:45.055
Wait, they were there?

33:45.088 --> 33:47.790
No, my parents invited me
over to dinner tonight.

33:48.925 --> 33:49.893
Wow.

33:49.925 --> 33:51.427
Well, that's awesome man.

33:51.461 --> 33:53.431
What's Karen making?
Maybe I'll stop by.

33:54.764 --> 33:56.733
I'm gonna tell them.

33:56.767 --> 33:58.969
What?

33:59.001 --> 34:01.437
Well, good luck
with that.

34:01.471 --> 34:02.839
I'm sure they're
gonna understand.

34:04.441 --> 34:07.978
Maybe you guys
could come.

34:08.011 --> 34:10.147
-this was tonight?
-Yeah.

34:10.179 --> 34:12.783
No, tonight I'm doing a...

34:12.815 --> 34:14.385
Michelle and I
have groupon.

34:14.417 --> 34:16.786
I... i would...
Yeah, I would come over,

34:16.819 --> 34:17.821
but, you know,
I'd probably...

34:17.853 --> 34:19.556
just say
something stupid

34:19.589 --> 34:21.025
and make
it way worse.

34:22.091 --> 34:23.092
Yeah.

34:23.126 --> 34:27.097
What about you, Chris?

34:27.129 --> 34:28.630
My parents love you.
Maybe, you know,

34:28.664 --> 34:30.800
like, make it easier.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.445
-Of course, man.
-Okay.

34:43.713 --> 34:46.949
So Adam, how are things?

34:46.982 --> 34:49.018
Mom, I'm gay.

34:49.051 --> 34:50.887
I'm sorry man, can I
just be your dad again?

34:50.920 --> 34:52.822
No, I need to be ready
for anything.

34:52.856 --> 34:54.690
And don't be afraid
to be mean, I can handle it.

34:54.723 --> 34:55.824
That's why I have
these note cards.

34:55.859 --> 34:56.860
Meaner, okay.

34:56.891 --> 34:58.161
-Yeah.
-Got it.

35:06.903 --> 35:08.038
Mom, I'm gay.

35:08.071 --> 35:10.707
What? That's disgusting.

35:10.740 --> 35:11.942
How could
you do this to me

35:11.975 --> 35:14.077
after I brought you
into this world?

35:14.109 --> 35:15.077
Anderson Cooper.

35:15.111 --> 35:16.078
I'm a terrible mother.

35:16.111 --> 35:17.180
... Ricky Martin.

35:17.214 --> 35:19.049
I'm a terrible mother.

35:19.082 --> 35:21.218
Neil Patrick Harris.
Neil Patrick Harris.

35:21.251 --> 35:24.187
What? Are your notes just
a list of famous gay dudes?

35:24.220 --> 35:25.188
No, I have lesbians too.

35:25.222 --> 35:26.723
Okay. Forget the list, dude.

35:26.756 --> 35:28.524
Just be honest.

35:28.557 --> 35:30.493
What's the worst
that could happen?

35:30.526 --> 35:32.162
My mom has a heart attack
and my dad freaks out

35:32.194 --> 35:34.131
'cause I'm never gonna
give him grandkids.

35:34.164 --> 35:36.732
Jesus, man.
You're gay.

35:36.765 --> 35:38.034
Not sterile.

35:38.068 --> 35:39.770
And your dad collects
antique clocks,

35:39.803 --> 35:41.605
he'll understand.

35:41.638 --> 35:43.841
Yeah.

35:43.874 --> 35:46.142
Yeah.

35:46.176 --> 35:48.178
Sorry to keep
everybody waiting.

35:48.211 --> 35:49.613
For your cooking, Karen,

35:49.646 --> 35:51.615
I would wait all night
if I had to.

35:51.647 --> 35:52.364
Chris.

35:52.365 --> 35:54.517
I'll tell you, this
salad is incredible.

35:54.551 --> 35:56.271
How is everything?
You still dating Jessica?

35:57.220 --> 35:58.856
Yeah... sometimes.

35:58.888 --> 36:00.857
Okay.

36:00.890 --> 36:03.370
What about you, Adam? When am I
gonna see you with a nice girl?

36:04.294 --> 36:05.929
Gee mom, I don't know.

36:05.961 --> 36:07.663
Lindsay has a boyfriend.
Did she tell you?

36:07.664 --> 36:08.231
No.

36:08.265 --> 36:10.701
-Actually mom, we broke up last week.
-Good.

36:10.734 --> 36:11.702
He's been trying
to snapchat me

36:11.734 --> 36:12.702
nonstop since.

36:12.736 --> 36:14.538
I hate snapchat.

36:14.571 --> 36:15.606
If he gives you any
trouble, let me know, okay?

36:15.638 --> 36:16.606
Adam and I will
take care of it.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.640
Yeah.

36:19.175 --> 36:21.577
Chris, do you think Jessica
has someone for our Adam?

36:21.611 --> 36:24.281
You know what? You may be
on to something there, Karen.

36:24.314 --> 36:25.749
What about
Dorothy cuda?

36:25.781 --> 36:26.917
Didn't you two
have a thing?

36:26.950 --> 36:27.917
Yeah. We went
to junior prom,

36:27.950 --> 36:29.685
like six years ago.

36:29.718 --> 36:31.687
-You two were so cute together.
-You were.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.256
Did I tell you that I ran
into her mother

36:33.289 --> 36:35.024
-at the grocery store the other day?
-Nope.

36:35.057 --> 36:37.093
Yeah, and she told me
that Dorothy is back in town,

36:37.127 --> 36:38.862
and she's single,
you know.

36:38.894 --> 36:40.563
Great. So...

36:40.597 --> 36:42.665
So...
Make yourself available.

36:42.698 --> 36:44.867
It feels like forever since
you broke up with Courtney.

36:44.901 --> 36:46.103
It's time
to move on.

36:46.135 --> 36:48.571
Get yourself
back out there.

36:48.604 --> 36:49.572
Yep. You're right.

36:49.606 --> 36:52.142
And, actually, i...

36:52.175 --> 36:54.644
I have have been.

36:54.678 --> 36:56.946
It's true. He's actually been
going on a lot of dates lately.

36:56.979 --> 36:58.548
Meeting some
interesting people.

36:59.348 --> 37:00.984
Yep.

37:01.017 --> 37:02.319
Anything serious?

37:02.352 --> 37:05.222
No.

37:05.254 --> 37:07.089
I don't wanna sound like one
of those crazy old mothers

37:07.122 --> 37:10.560
that does nothing but
hound her son for grandkids.

37:10.593 --> 37:12.028
It would just be nice
to see you with someone.

37:12.062 --> 37:13.730
And what if I never
meet somebody?

37:13.763 --> 37:15.966
You will. You're gonna
meet a great girl.

37:15.999 --> 37:17.200
-Sooner than you think.
-No, I'm not.

37:17.232 --> 37:18.769
Because...

37:18.801 --> 37:20.004
I...

37:21.937 --> 37:23.106
I...

37:26.309 --> 37:28.812
Elton John.

37:28.845 --> 37:30.580
What's rocket man have
to do with anything?

37:39.321 --> 37:40.990
So you're going
on a double date?

37:41.024 --> 37:43.660
Yeah. I think Adam's
excited about it.

37:43.693 --> 37:45.928
Yes.

37:45.961 --> 37:47.129
Aw. Hey, why didn't you
ever set me up

37:47.162 --> 37:48.664
with any of Jess's
hot friends?

37:48.698 --> 37:50.634
You banged two and then
never called them again.

37:50.667 --> 37:52.970
Okay, they never called
me either so...

37:53.002 --> 37:54.771
What-what am
I supposed to do?

37:55.805 --> 37:57.640
One second, boys.

37:57.673 --> 37:58.673
I'll get it.

38:02.678 --> 38:04.046
Hey Martha.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.248
Hello, Chris.

38:05.281 --> 38:06.350
Just dropping
this off for Adam.

38:06.383 --> 38:07.884
Could you see
that he gets it

38:07.917 --> 38:09.477
before it's too late
in the eyes of god?

38:11.021 --> 38:12.890
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Thank you.

38:20.664 --> 38:22.198
Ortu, I hope you're hungry.

38:22.231 --> 38:24.133
Fuck. Free cake.

38:27.736 --> 38:30.139
What the hell
is camp leviticus?

38:30.173 --> 38:32.109
I think it's one of those
conversion camps for gay dudes.

38:32.142 --> 38:33.944
If you wanna make
a gay dude straight,

38:33.977 --> 38:35.846
you gotta show a little
more cleavage on that cake.

38:35.879 --> 38:37.681
Actually, according
to an article I was reading,

38:37.714 --> 38:39.982
the apa has no proof that a
change in sexual orientation

38:40.015 --> 38:43.153
is even possible.

38:43.185 --> 38:45.354
Hey man, sorry.
We kinda outed you to her.

38:45.388 --> 38:47.290
I don't care.
She thinks we're all gay.

38:47.323 --> 38:48.959
Wait a minute.
You have a date tonight,

38:48.992 --> 38:50.292
and you're wearing
those pants with those shoes?

38:50.325 --> 38:51.661
And that loose shirt?

38:51.694 --> 38:53.696
You can't even
see your abs.

38:57.232 --> 38:58.267
So I tell the curator,

38:58.301 --> 38:59.269
you see the name
on the wall?

38:59.301 --> 39:01.437
This is my gallery.

39:01.470 --> 39:04.907
IF I WANT TO SUBMIT A 15x8,
I'm GONNA SUBMIT A 15x8.

39:04.941 --> 39:05.975
And that shut
him up...

39:06.008 --> 39:06.976
so fast.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.778
I bet it did.

39:08.812 --> 39:11.314
What do you
paint exactly?

39:11.347 --> 39:13.984
Mostly abstract post-modern
deconstructionalism,

39:14.017 --> 39:16.787
peppered with neoclassical
ideologies.

39:16.819 --> 39:18.821
Wow, that's a lot.

39:18.854 --> 39:20.990
So Jess tells me
you're a mechanic.

39:21.024 --> 39:23.960
Yeah. Yeah,
I do mostly everything.

39:23.993 --> 39:26.263
Small repairs,
tune-ups.

39:26.296 --> 39:28.198
-Great mechanic.
-Thanks, man.

39:28.231 --> 39:30.367
God, how do you do it?

39:30.399 --> 39:32.368
You're going through life
everyday, never creating art.

39:32.401 --> 39:33.970
I couldn't imagine.

39:34.002 --> 39:36.173
Yeah. Yeah, I know
exactly what you mean.

39:36.205 --> 39:39.443
You know,
I actually sketch everyday.

39:39.475 --> 39:41.744
I just don't have
the talent that you have.

39:41.778 --> 39:44.747
We should check out my gallery
sometime. Maybe I can inspire you.

39:44.781 --> 39:46.183
After you have to go to
this gorditos place,

39:46.216 --> 39:48.218
and across the street
is this fabulous boutique.

39:48.251 --> 39:49.819
I'd take some of my other
girlfriends there,

39:49.852 --> 39:51.354
but they don't have
the body for the place.

39:51.386 --> 39:52.955
I said it.

39:52.988 --> 39:54.290
-Stop.
-I just said it.

39:54.323 --> 39:55.291
-You said it.
-There it goes.

39:55.325 --> 39:56.694
You just said it.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.062
I gotta take you
to taco bell sometime,

40:00.095 --> 40:02.098
they've got
this fabulous new gordita.

40:02.131 --> 40:03.365
Really? Wow.

40:03.399 --> 40:04.801
-Do I have the body for it?
-You do.

40:04.834 --> 40:06.069
-Thank you.
-You just said it.

40:06.102 --> 40:07.804
-I said it.
-You said it.

40:07.836 --> 40:09.171
Marc do you wanna come
outside and smoke with me?

40:09.205 --> 40:10.973
I wanna hear all about
this boutique.

40:11.006 --> 40:12.908
Usually I'd say no,
but two margs

40:12.941 --> 40:15.344
and I start smoking
like a little hot tamale.

40:22.017 --> 40:23.720
Wow.

40:24.821 --> 40:26.123
He seems...

40:26.156 --> 40:27.758
-Non-threatening...
-i hate him.

40:27.790 --> 40:29.225
Okay.

40:29.258 --> 40:32.862
Adam.
Nice to see you here.

40:32.896 --> 40:35.098
Is this the reason
you're not texting me back?

40:35.131 --> 40:36.333
No.

40:36.365 --> 40:37.501
No, it's not
what it looks like.

40:37.533 --> 40:39.102
No,
we're not dating.

40:39.135 --> 40:41.403
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

40:41.437 --> 40:43.106
Sometimes I fly off the
handle. Sorry about that.

40:43.138 --> 40:45.142
-We're engaged.
-What?

40:46.176 --> 40:47.377
Right, Chris?

40:47.410 --> 40:48.944
This is Brad.

40:48.977 --> 40:50.847
Brad, remember I was
telling you about him.

40:50.879 --> 40:54.184
-Honey duder, this is bradstar?
-Yeah.

40:54.216 --> 40:56.285
Bradstar,
it is a pleasure to meet you.

40:56.318 --> 40:58.387
No, I'm not gonna
shake your hand.

40:58.421 --> 40:59.388
I could've given
you everything,

40:59.421 --> 41:01.090
you know that right?

41:01.124 --> 41:03.193
You toss me aside
for nothing but a gigolo.

41:03.225 --> 41:05.060
-Whoa, whoa...
-A pretty face.

41:05.093 --> 41:07.396
He's not a gigolo.
He's awesome.

41:07.430 --> 41:08.565
He's my best friend.

41:08.597 --> 41:10.065
What's going on here?

41:10.098 --> 41:11.901
Who the hell
are you?

41:11.935 --> 41:13.537
Marc Peters,
Adam's date.

41:13.569 --> 41:15.305
Yeah.

41:15.338 --> 41:17.140
Okay, I see.

41:17.173 --> 41:18.975
So, apparently
I'm the only guy here

41:19.008 --> 41:20.877
who you're not fucking,
is that right?

41:22.477 --> 41:24.446
Why didn't you tell me you're
into group stuff, silly?

41:24.479 --> 41:25.948
-Well...
-Right?

41:25.981 --> 41:28.050
We could go down
to my basement, all of us.

41:28.084 --> 41:29.152
It'd be fun.

41:29.185 --> 41:30.953
-A group thing.
-Yeah.

41:30.986 --> 41:32.555
Think about it,
text me later, okay?

41:32.589 --> 41:33.824
Okay.

41:37.093 --> 41:38.261
Well, I should have
seen it before,

41:38.294 --> 41:40.129
it's so obvious,
with your perfect hair,

41:40.162 --> 41:42.998
and those,
"look at my crotch," jeans.

41:43.031 --> 41:44.867
And you should
see him dance

41:44.901 --> 41:46.336
when he gets
two margs in him.

41:46.368 --> 41:47.336
Right?

41:47.370 --> 41:49.205
They're not...

41:49.238 --> 41:51.941
Fine, call it bisexual. If
it helps you sleep at night.

41:51.975 --> 41:53.410
Okay. Okay,
this is enough.

41:53.443 --> 41:55.145
I don't know what's
going on, Chris.

41:55.178 --> 41:57.080
Tell Marc that you and Adam
haven't slept together.

41:57.113 --> 41:58.548
Yeah, tell him.

41:58.580 --> 42:01.251
Well... i guess we didn't do
a whole lot of sleeping.

42:01.283 --> 42:02.452
No, we definitely
did not.

42:02.484 --> 42:03.486
Well, maybe like
a little bit, like...

42:03.519 --> 42:04.988
-naps
-like in between.

42:05.021 --> 42:06.223
Yeah, but mostly it was
just going at it.

42:06.256 --> 42:08.491
Marc, you have
no idea how good it is.

42:08.524 --> 42:11.161
I mean, I hate even talking
about it over dinner.

42:11.193 --> 42:13.095
-But...
-Yeah, don't brag.

42:13.129 --> 42:15.498
I would die
if I couldn't create

42:15.531 --> 42:16.900
fabulous multiple orgasms
with you every night.

42:16.932 --> 42:18.968
That means
the world to me.

42:19.002 --> 42:21.638
Thanks for the invite, Jess. But
I can tell when I'm not wanted.

42:21.671 --> 42:23.373
What? Really?

42:23.406 --> 42:26.977
My boy e-Zach is djing
at the "unsh-unsh" bar tonight

42:27.010 --> 42:28.544
and I was gonna get going
anyway.

42:28.577 --> 42:30.097
-It was really nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.615
Kiss, kiss.
Ew,ew.

42:37.486 --> 42:39.255
Great headband.

42:41.457 --> 42:43.393
-Ew.
-Ew, ew, ew.

42:43.426 --> 42:45.562
-Kiss kiss.
-What kind of gay are you?

42:45.595 --> 42:47.297
You are hating
on your own kind.

42:47.330 --> 42:49.065
Yeah, I don't hate him
because he's gay.

42:49.097 --> 42:49.923
No, he hates him
'cause he sucks balls.

42:49.924 --> 42:50.199
Yeah.

42:50.232 --> 42:51.200
You are
such an asshole.

42:51.234 --> 42:53.103
I'm an asshole?

42:53.135 --> 42:55.104
You're an asshole for making
us hang out with this guy.

42:55.138 --> 42:57.406
What made you think Adam
would ever like that prick?

42:57.439 --> 42:59.475
Well, Adam's gay.
And he's gay.

42:59.508 --> 43:01.243
So what else
is there?

43:01.276 --> 43:03.280
Attraction,
mutual interests...

43:03.312 --> 43:05.115
not being a giant,
raging douchebag.

43:05.147 --> 43:06.216
That's
on your list too?

43:07.950 --> 43:10.519
Well, since you two
have so much in common,

43:10.553 --> 43:11.521
why don't you
fuck him tonight?

43:11.553 --> 43:12.923
Because we're over.

43:12.955 --> 43:15.524
Whoa, okay, Jess.
We're kidding.

43:15.557 --> 43:17.293
Fuck.
I'll be right back.

43:21.631 --> 43:23.399
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

43:23.432 --> 43:25.200
I'm sorry, okay?
We're kidding.

43:25.234 --> 43:26.202
We're just
joking around.

43:26.234 --> 43:28.037
Maybe you are.

43:28.071 --> 43:29.639
But Adam's not.

43:29.671 --> 43:31.974
You know, you probably
shouldn't joke around.

43:32.008 --> 43:33.710
You're only screwing
with his head.

43:33.743 --> 43:35.478
What are
you talking about?

43:35.510 --> 43:38.213
Chris, I told you
this would happen.

43:38.247 --> 43:39.382
Adam likes you.

43:39.414 --> 43:41.417
Adam does not like me.

43:41.450 --> 43:43.218
I know what
I'm talking about.

43:43.252 --> 43:44.721
I'm a girl,
I notice these things.

43:44.754 --> 43:46.056
Adam didn't
even give Marc a chance.

43:46.089 --> 43:47.457
He barely even looked
at him

43:47.490 --> 43:49.459
because he was too busy
staring at you all night.

43:49.492 --> 43:52.428
No, it's because looking at Marc
makes you want to murder someone.

43:52.461 --> 43:55.130
Okay. Okay, fine.
Don't believe me.

43:55.164 --> 43:56.665
But when you wake up
one morning,

43:56.698 --> 43:58.968
tied to your bed with
Adam's tongue in your ass,

43:59.002 --> 44:00.637
don't come crying
back to me.

44:08.510 --> 44:10.179
Hey, man.
There you are.

44:10.213 --> 44:11.981
You wanna get gay?

44:12.015 --> 44:13.283
What?

44:13.316 --> 44:15.118
I got some two shots.
You want one?

44:15.151 --> 44:16.685
Yeah.

44:16.718 --> 44:18.220
Yeah, sure.

44:18.254 --> 44:19.623
-Cheers, man.
-Cheers, dude.

44:25.495 --> 44:26.663
God, it does not
get any easier.

44:26.696 --> 44:28.131
No, but can we
have two more?

44:30.332 --> 44:31.367
Boo.

44:36.205 --> 44:37.173
You should do it.

44:37.205 --> 44:38.173
-No.
-Yep.

44:38.207 --> 44:39.743
-No.
-Yeah.

44:39.776 --> 44:41.077
-No.
-You should do it, you should call her.

44:41.109 --> 44:43.046
Abso-frickin'-lutely not.

44:43.078 --> 44:44.214
-No, seriously. You should call her.
-Never again, man.

44:44.247 --> 44:46.015
I don't care
how hot she is,

44:46.048 --> 44:48.150
or how good
of blow jays she gives...

44:48.184 --> 44:49.452
-No.
-She's a crazy bitch.

44:49.484 --> 44:50.553
I'm not talking
about Jess,

44:50.586 --> 44:52.055
I'm talking
about Tracy.

44:52.088 --> 44:55.091
No, man.
I already blew that one.

44:55.124 --> 44:57.493
If I call her now, I'm
just gonna look desperate.

44:57.526 --> 44:59.128
Besides man,
girls like her

44:59.162 --> 45:00.597
do not go
for guys like me.

45:00.629 --> 45:02.097
Girls like what?

45:02.131 --> 45:03.098
You talk about her
like she's perfect.

45:03.131 --> 45:04.166
You don't even know her.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.402
I know her.
I know her.

45:05.435 --> 45:06.603
I know that she's got
enough balls

45:06.635 --> 45:08.504
to wear a Fanny pack
to a bar.

45:08.537 --> 45:10.272
She's cool enough
to like mojitos,

45:10.305 --> 45:12.307
and "ghostbusters."

45:12.341 --> 45:14.344
She's funny, smart...

45:14.377 --> 45:15.512
Aww, man.

45:16.778 --> 45:18.614
Now you sound
like the gay one.

45:18.647 --> 45:20.416
Fuck you.

45:21.584 --> 45:24.588
Okay. Just fucking
call her, dude.

45:26.388 --> 45:28.657
Hey, Tracy.
It's...

45:28.691 --> 45:30.526
It's Chris.

45:30.560 --> 45:31.560
All right.

45:33.396 --> 45:35.397
Hey Tracy,
it's Chris...

45:39.435 --> 45:41.404
-Hey.
-Hey...

45:41.437 --> 45:43.772
I'm not here right now,
so just leave me a message,

45:43.805 --> 45:45.175
and I'll call you
right back.

45:47.276 --> 45:50.312
I'm just calling...
To make sure

45:50.345 --> 45:52.381
that you...
You didn't...

45:52.414 --> 45:55.150
No one,
no one bother...

45:55.184 --> 45:57.687
that everything
worked out just fine...

45:57.720 --> 45:59.522
that even...

45:59.555 --> 46:03.259
Just calling
to wish you a happy day.

46:03.292 --> 46:06.696
-Anyways...
-Cute voice-mail.

46:06.729 --> 46:08.631
It's Chris. Bye.

46:21.611 --> 46:23.146
Here you go, dude.

46:23.178 --> 46:25.180
Nothing cures a hangover
like a hit of doober.

46:25.214 --> 46:26.816
Thanks.

46:26.848 --> 46:28.288
What'd you guys do
last night anyway?

46:29.885 --> 46:31.588
Went on a double date
with Chris.

46:31.620 --> 46:34.156
-Gay.
-Really?

46:34.189 --> 46:35.624
Yeah, I mean, think
about what can you not do

46:35.658 --> 46:36.759
on a double date?

46:36.792 --> 46:37.832
You can't
get your fuck on.

46:37.859 --> 46:39.261
Am I right?

46:39.294 --> 46:41.130
Did you fuck her?

46:41.164 --> 46:42.232
You didn't fuck her.

46:42.265 --> 46:43.466
-Did you fuck her?
-No. No.

46:43.499 --> 46:44.501
-You dirty dog.
-Did not fuck her.

46:44.533 --> 46:46.669
See that's
what I'm saying.

46:46.702 --> 46:48.604
See, next time, bring her
to your house. All right?

46:48.638 --> 46:50.206
So it's just
the two of you.

46:50.238 --> 46:51.907
Rent a horror movie,
clean the bathroom,

46:51.941 --> 46:53.609
put some candles out, man.
They appreciate that stuff.

46:53.642 --> 46:55.511
-Put a tie on...
-Hello?

46:55.544 --> 46:57.180
You know what I mean? Also get
the lube going before she...

46:57.213 --> 46:58.314
hey, got any visine?

46:58.347 --> 46:59.582
Why? Ryan's not
coming back?

46:59.615 --> 47:01.283
Yeah. No, I just...
it's a customer.

47:01.316 --> 47:03.485
I don't wanna look
unprofessional.

47:03.519 --> 47:05.354
But then I'm telling you,
ten minutes...

47:05.388 --> 47:06.856
-you got any gum?
-Your shorts are gonna be off.

47:06.888 --> 47:08.357
Gum? How hot
is this girl, man?

47:08.390 --> 47:10.260
You know what,
never mind. Forget it.

47:10.292 --> 47:12.261
Hey...

47:12.294 --> 47:14.396
-How's it going?
-Good. Can I help you with something?

47:14.430 --> 47:16.533
Yeah, I think something's
wrong with my car.

47:16.566 --> 47:18.301
It's been overheating
a lot

47:18.334 --> 47:20.803
and sometimes it just
shuts off completely.

47:20.836 --> 47:23.372
Yeah. Sounds like
it could be your radiator.

47:23.406 --> 47:24.674
Let's just pop it open.

47:26.742 --> 47:27.843
-Pop this.
-I can get it.

47:27.877 --> 47:29.146
It's sometimes
a little tricky.

47:30.546 --> 47:31.814
Sorry.

47:31.847 --> 47:33.950
No. By all means.

47:33.982 --> 47:35.218
Okay.

47:37.419 --> 47:39.222
I'll get that.

47:39.254 --> 47:40.656
-Thanks.
-No problem.

47:42.258 --> 47:44.827
You know what,
it could be your DC inverter.

47:44.859 --> 47:45.928
Really?

47:45.961 --> 47:47.463
Yeah.

47:47.495 --> 47:50.232
What's a DC converter?

47:50.265 --> 47:52.702
It's an inverter.

47:52.734 --> 47:53.970
It's this.
It's what...

47:54.002 --> 47:55.838
Makes your car work.

47:55.870 --> 47:58.240
Yeah,
they have arrived.

47:58.274 --> 47:59.742
The official invites

47:59.774 --> 48:02.778
to papa ortu's fourth
of July barbeque bash.

48:02.812 --> 48:04.681
See you there,
and see you there.

48:04.714 --> 48:07.283
And you better rsvp
this time.

48:07.316 --> 48:08.584
Fuck that, you know I'm
going. Why do I need to rsvp?

48:08.618 --> 48:09.619
'Cause my dad's
sick and tired

48:09.651 --> 48:10.919
of running
out of ribs.

48:10.952 --> 48:14.389
If you don't rsvp,
you don't get any ribs.

48:14.423 --> 48:17.327
Whoa, slow down, tiger.
What's up with you?

48:17.359 --> 48:18.560
I think I met someone.

48:18.593 --> 48:19.828
Seriously?
Who?

48:19.861 --> 48:20.863
Well, I don't know
his name exactly,

48:20.896 --> 48:22.598
but we had a moment.

48:22.631 --> 48:24.666
A moment? Like where was
this, in a truck stop?

48:24.700 --> 48:26.535
No. How do you know so much
about gay things?

48:26.568 --> 48:28.437
No. He... i don't
even know if he's gay.

48:28.470 --> 48:29.571
Don't you have gaydar?

48:29.604 --> 48:31.373
Well, kind of.

48:31.406 --> 48:33.876
If you had gaydar, you'd know
that Nick loves the cock.

48:36.879 --> 48:39.015
So what did this gentleman's
pants look like?

48:39.048 --> 48:40.450
Could you see his ankles?

48:40.482 --> 48:41.450
Was he, like, wearing
a tank top?

48:41.484 --> 48:42.552
Were his nipples
pierced?

48:42.584 --> 48:44.287
Yeah, what about
his underwear,

48:44.319 --> 48:45.655
did it have a brightly
colored elastic band?

48:45.687 --> 48:47.323
Super jacked?

48:47.356 --> 48:49.825
He was a normal gay,
with like earth-tone colors.

48:49.859 --> 48:51.694
Full length pants.
No nipple piercings.

48:51.727 --> 48:53.363
I couldn't really see
his underwear,

48:53.396 --> 48:54.997
but it was probably

48:55.031 --> 48:56.966
and he had muscles,
but not, like, too muscley.

48:56.999 --> 48:58.935
He was probably,
he was like a normal dude.

49:01.771 --> 49:02.872
How did
he eat a banana?

49:02.905 --> 49:04.673
How would you
eat a banana?

49:04.707 --> 49:06.542
Like put the whole thing in
and pull out just the peel.

49:06.575 --> 49:07.810
Okay, then that's
exactly... i don't know.

49:07.843 --> 49:09.611
-He was just...
-guys, guys.

49:09.644 --> 49:11.647
Guys, it says... It says
that people in north Korea

49:11.680 --> 49:13.383
aren't even allowed
to eat bananas.

49:13.415 --> 49:15.415
They don't know what...
they don't know they exist.

49:17.586 --> 49:19.888
I did not know that. Wow.

49:19.921 --> 49:20.889
Okay, look. All I know
is that this guy,

49:20.923 --> 49:22.725
he was super friendly.

49:22.758 --> 49:25.761
And at some point we like had
eye contact for two seconds.

49:25.794 --> 49:27.329
Two seconds?
That's nothing.

49:27.363 --> 49:28.631
That's just like being
a polite gentleman.

49:28.664 --> 49:29.665
Like look...

49:29.698 --> 49:31.367
See. I'm not gay.

49:31.399 --> 49:32.801
-That's not two seconds.
-You wanna do two seconds?

49:32.834 --> 49:34.970
-Two seconds.
-Here we go.

49:35.004 --> 49:37.373
One Mississippi.

49:37.406 --> 49:38.508
Two Mississippi.

49:38.540 --> 49:39.776
I can't do it.

49:39.809 --> 49:42.577
-He's so gay.
-Wow. Weird tickle.

49:42.611 --> 49:44.047
See, i... so, he's gay?

49:44.080 --> 49:45.415
He's gay.

49:45.448 --> 49:46.683
I think
you're in luck.

49:46.716 --> 49:48.818
He's super gay, man.

49:48.850 --> 49:51.086
All right. Cool.
I met someone.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.888
Are you wearing
Cologne, dude?

49:52.921 --> 49:55.857
Yeah, it's to hide
the pot smell.

49:55.890 --> 49:57.626
Did you smoke pot today
without me?

49:57.660 --> 49:59.761
Are you... is this what
these bananas are for?

49:59.794 --> 50:01.074
Who do you think
drives this car?

50:03.466 --> 50:04.767
I don't know,
it's a hybrid, dude.

50:04.800 --> 50:05.935
It's got a "save the whales"
bumper sticker.

50:05.968 --> 50:07.803
Probably some
gay-ass hippy.

50:07.836 --> 50:09.772
-Really? You think so?
-Yeah.

50:35.030 --> 50:37.066
Adam. Triple-a
just called.

50:37.098 --> 50:39.102
Some girl locked her keys
in the car over in hillside.

50:39.135 --> 50:40.770
Black wrangler.
I need you to go now.

50:40.803 --> 50:42.638
Ron, I'll do it man.

50:42.671 --> 50:43.973
Did she sound 18
on the phone?

50:44.006 --> 50:45.375
Why so you can get
stoned for two hours

50:45.408 --> 50:47.110
and jerk off
in the Wendy's bathroom?

50:47.142 --> 50:48.377
Once. Hey,
that one time.

50:48.410 --> 50:49.544
Yeah, it's
all it takes.

50:49.577 --> 50:51.146
Here. Better get
over there, Adam.

50:51.180 --> 50:53.082
-I was...
-I need you right now. Let's go.

50:53.115 --> 50:55.718
... 'Kay.

51:02.557 --> 51:03.792
You're all set.
Thanks for coming in.

51:03.825 --> 51:06.094
Thanks again,
thank you.

51:06.127 --> 51:08.097
Hey. Hey.

51:08.129 --> 51:09.631
-Hi.
-Hi.

51:09.664 --> 51:11.099
Is there something wrong
with the car still?

51:11.133 --> 51:12.901
No.

51:12.935 --> 51:14.104
You just...

51:15.470 --> 51:17.839
You forgot
your chapstick.

51:21.544 --> 51:22.944
Did you take this
from my glove box?

51:24.113 --> 51:25.415
No.

51:27.182 --> 51:28.684
Okay. Yeah, I did.

51:28.716 --> 51:30.452
But I was just...
it was an accident.

51:30.486 --> 51:32.054
I didn't use it or anything.

51:32.086 --> 51:33.389
I just smelled it.

51:36.158 --> 51:37.394
Okay.

51:38.461 --> 51:39.596
Thanks.

51:40.662 --> 51:42.731
I'm gonna go here.

51:42.765 --> 51:43.900
Me too.

51:44.899 --> 51:45.968
See ya.

51:57.946 --> 51:59.816
I smelled it?

52:00.816 --> 52:03.051
You fucking idiot.

52:03.084 --> 52:05.454
I smelled it?

52:05.488 --> 52:06.689
Adam, what'd you smell, dude?

52:06.722 --> 52:08.723
Was it that girl?
Was she here?

52:08.756 --> 52:09.858
I bet her titties
were out today,

52:09.892 --> 52:11.060
it's so hot out.

52:11.093 --> 52:12.728
Did you see them?
Were they big?

52:12.760 --> 52:13.929
Pleasant? Normal?
Medium size?

52:13.963 --> 52:15.665
I don't know titties.

52:15.698 --> 52:16.900
I'm gay.

52:34.716 --> 52:36.885
-Hey.
-Hey, man.

52:36.919 --> 52:38.554
Wash your hands
and put on a clean shirt.

52:38.586 --> 52:39.955
What for?

52:39.988 --> 52:41.022
Shoot, they're early.

52:41.055 --> 52:42.724
Who's early?

52:42.758 --> 52:45.026
Adam, why don't you put on one
of your father's shirts?

52:45.060 --> 52:46.084
Chris, do you mind
answering the door, please?

52:46.085 --> 52:46.596
Whatever you say, Karen.

52:46.629 --> 52:48.598
Why do I have
to change?

52:48.631 --> 52:52.033
Your mom invited Dorothy cuda and
her mother over for dinner tonight.

52:52.066 --> 52:53.935
What? Why?
Why did you do that?

52:53.968 --> 52:56.004
Relax.
Don't be nervous.

52:56.037 --> 52:57.873
Dorothy likes you.
Her mother told me so.

52:57.906 --> 52:59.675
Yeah, well what if
I don't like Dorothy cuda?

52:59.707 --> 53:01.743
How could you not
like Dorothy cuda?

53:01.776 --> 53:03.078
Well, there's
a lot of reasons why

53:03.111 --> 53:04.579
I couldn't like Dorothy cuda.

53:04.613 --> 53:07.082
Welcome, welcome.
Father O'Malley. Martha.

53:07.115 --> 53:08.550
What are you
doing here?

53:08.584 --> 53:10.553
What are you doing
out of bed, Adam?

53:10.586 --> 53:12.021
What?

53:12.053 --> 53:14.856
Now, I'm not here
to impose.

53:14.890 --> 53:16.893
I know this
is a difficult time.

53:16.926 --> 53:19.529
So enjoy your last meal
with your family.

53:19.562 --> 53:21.531
I can give last rites
afterwards.

53:21.564 --> 53:24.133
Last rites? Why would
you give my son last rites?

53:25.633 --> 53:27.669
He's about to die.
Isn't he?

53:27.702 --> 53:29.604
-What?
-No.

53:29.638 --> 53:33.109
I'm... I'm sorry, father
but it's worse than death.

53:33.142 --> 53:35.877
It's a matter
of eternal damnation.

53:35.910 --> 53:37.780
Adam, what on earth
is she talking about?

53:42.651 --> 53:43.786
I'm gay, mom.

53:43.818 --> 53:45.287
That is not funny.

53:45.321 --> 53:47.990
Do not joke like that
in front of father O'Malley.

53:48.022 --> 53:50.825
I'm serious.
I'm gay. I'm gay.

53:50.859 --> 53:51.928
I like guys.

53:53.095 --> 53:54.930
But...
What about Dorothy cuda?

53:54.964 --> 53:56.599
-What about Dorothy...
-she's on her way.

53:56.631 --> 53:58.667
I don't understand why
you don't understand this.

53:58.700 --> 54:00.235
I'm gay. I'm gay.

54:00.269 --> 54:02.071
Like... like...

54:06.709 --> 54:08.111
So stop forcing
Dorothy cuda on me.

54:09.144 --> 54:11.247
Adam,

54:11.280 --> 54:13.649
I was eating that.

54:13.682 --> 54:15.602
Seriously? You're upset
about a frickin' sausage?

54:23.926 --> 54:25.361
Come on.
No, dude.

54:25.394 --> 54:27.629
The night is set.
We're going to Duffy's.

54:27.662 --> 54:28.863
What about Adam?

54:28.897 --> 54:31.300
We will be there
for him... at Duffy's.

54:31.332 --> 54:32.934
Come on guys.

54:32.968 --> 54:34.337
How many strip clubs
have we dragged Adam to?

54:34.370 --> 54:35.638
Okay,
that's irrelevant.

54:35.671 --> 54:36.839
How many dollars
has he shoved

54:36.872 --> 54:38.674
down skanky Russian
breasts for you?

54:38.707 --> 54:40.609
And how many times has he
fixed your piece of shit car?

54:40.642 --> 54:43.244
-My car is not a piece of shit.
-It's a piece of shit.

54:43.278 --> 54:44.879
When Adam came out,
I told him,

54:44.912 --> 54:48.316
I promised him that
nothing was gonna change.

54:48.350 --> 54:50.653
I think we've been pretty
fucking cool about that.

54:50.685 --> 54:53.990
We've done a descent job,
but it's not good enough.

54:54.022 --> 54:55.124
Things should change.

54:56.658 --> 54:58.760
He needs this, boys.

54:58.794 --> 55:00.129
He needs us.

55:16.912 --> 55:21.017
So where we going?

55:21.050 --> 55:22.730
You're serious...
you're not gonna tell me?

55:24.919 --> 55:27.789
Okay.

55:30.926 --> 55:35.865
All right.

55:35.897 --> 55:39.434
Are we really gonna...

55:39.468 --> 55:43.406
Seriously?

55:43.439 --> 55:46.008
Remember, don't make
eye contact with anyone.

55:46.040 --> 55:47.142
Never leave
each other's sight.

55:47.176 --> 55:48.177
No matter what.

55:50.078 --> 55:52.814
Wait for us.

56:22.377 --> 56:23.946
Can we get four buds?

56:23.979 --> 56:25.982
Actually, can you make
those vodka sodas?

56:27.883 --> 56:29.819
We're in a gay bar.

56:29.852 --> 56:32.088
Vodka sodas it is.

56:32.120 --> 56:33.789
There's actually
some girls here.

56:33.821 --> 56:34.990
We didn't come
all the way downtown

56:35.022 --> 56:36.492
for you to be
looking at girls.

56:36.524 --> 56:37.959
Yeah, man. You better
get at least eight dudes'

56:37.993 --> 56:39.161
phone numbers tonight,

56:39.193 --> 56:41.263
and they better
be fucking adorable.

56:47.102 --> 56:48.270
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

56:48.303 --> 56:51.207
First time
in a... okay. Nice.

56:51.240 --> 56:54.109
Act like you've
been there before, boys.

56:54.142 --> 56:55.410
Should we dance?

56:55.443 --> 56:56.911
No. I'm good.

56:56.944 --> 56:58.147
Aw man, how are you going
to meet anybody

56:58.180 --> 56:59.982
with your back
up against the bar?

57:00.015 --> 57:02.118
Let's go.

57:02.151 --> 57:04.986
I'll hold down. Make
sure no one roofies us.

57:06.354 --> 57:08.857
So much
for sticking together.

57:08.890 --> 57:10.492
Come on, baby. Bring
your "a" game.

57:16.464 --> 57:17.733
It's weird.

57:20.836 --> 57:22.004
-Like?
-Relax.

57:22.037 --> 57:24.006
Feel the groove, man.

57:24.039 --> 57:25.006
There we go.

57:25.039 --> 57:26.274
Yeah? Okay.

57:26.307 --> 57:27.909
-You look hot.
-All right, thanks.

57:27.943 --> 57:30.146
You look really,
really good.

57:30.178 --> 57:32.013
-Shake your dick, let's go.
-All right.

57:32.046 --> 57:33.048
Show him how
it's done, man.

57:33.080 --> 57:34.349
Show him how
it's done.

57:34.383 --> 57:36.919
Whoa.
There you go.

57:38.053 --> 57:40.056
Shot, please.

57:47.495 --> 57:48.865
Wait for me, guys.

58:06.247 --> 58:08.283
-Adam?
-Hi, what are you doing here?

58:08.316 --> 58:10.351
-Hi.
-Are you... wait one second.

58:10.385 --> 58:11.385
Chris.

58:14.488 --> 58:16.391
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

58:16.425 --> 58:19.327
I'm here with my brother
and his boyfriend.

58:19.361 --> 58:21.230
And they're really hitting
it off with your friend.

58:21.263 --> 58:23.265
They sure are.

58:23.298 --> 58:26.502
Look, the voice-mail
that I left you...

58:26.535 --> 58:28.571
-What?
-The voice-mail I left the other night.

58:28.604 --> 58:30.406
I'm sorry,
I don't know what...

58:30.439 --> 58:32.441
it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

58:32.473 --> 58:34.276
Let's just dance.

58:34.309 --> 58:36.912
Okay.

58:56.999 --> 58:59.501
So that's the last time I
order a hotdog in a gay bar.

59:01.336 --> 59:03.638
So how was your guys'
fist time in a gay bar?

59:03.671 --> 59:06.140
I was just dancing.
That is all.

59:06.173 --> 59:07.942
Honestly, I thought
it'd be a lot gayer.

59:07.975 --> 59:09.477
I'm kinda disappointed.

59:09.510 --> 59:11.312
It was good.

59:11.345 --> 59:12.614
It was really good.

59:12.647 --> 59:14.550
It was good.
So how'd you two meet?

59:14.582 --> 59:17.019
Actually we worked at
the same office for years.

59:17.051 --> 59:19.454
I was already out to
everyone there, Steve wasn't.

59:19.488 --> 59:22.156
So things developed
rather slowly.

59:22.189 --> 59:24.325
Eight months of asking
to borrow his hole-puncher,

59:24.359 --> 59:26.061
I thought he'd get the hint.

59:26.093 --> 59:27.262
So there's
just one thing

59:27.296 --> 59:29.298
that I still can't wrap
my head around...

59:29.330 --> 59:33.269
how does a gay man let his
sister walk out in public

59:33.301 --> 59:34.502
with a Fanny pack on?

59:34.535 --> 59:35.604
What?

59:37.571 --> 59:40.008
-A lot of testosterone.
-Nice.

59:41.310 --> 59:43.012
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Tracy.

59:43.044 --> 59:44.613
I can do better,
trust me.

59:44.646 --> 59:45.981
Wait, what did
you call me?

59:46.013 --> 59:48.149
-Tracy.
-Who's Tracy?

59:52.187 --> 59:54.957
Who isn't Tracy?

59:54.990 --> 59:58.093
Okay, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

59:58.126 --> 59:59.461
Trainy, Tracy, trainy.

59:59.493 --> 01:00:02.263
Just doesn't...
It's so funny.

01:00:02.296 --> 01:00:05.066
Trainy? You think
that my name is trainy?

01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:10.039
He's kidding.
He does... he does that.

01:00:10.071 --> 01:00:12.040
Like calls
people "trainy."

01:00:12.073 --> 01:00:13.541
-Hey trainy.
-He called me train for five years.

01:00:13.575 --> 01:00:15.077
He called me trainy
tranny when I came out.

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:17.445
-He's a train guy.
-Yeah.

01:00:17.479 --> 01:00:19.181
Wait,
so what is my name?

01:00:22.084 --> 01:00:24.086
Could we have
the check?

01:00:30.492 --> 01:00:31.526
I love this part.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.396
Yeah, me too.

01:00:34.428 --> 01:00:35.497
That guy's
as ugly as you.

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.533
Hey, shut up.

01:00:41.769 --> 01:00:44.439
Tricia.
Maybe it's tricia.

01:00:45.439 --> 01:00:46.508
Maybe.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.642
Should I text
her that?

01:00:47.676 --> 01:00:49.178
No, it's like 4ªm.

01:00:50.479 --> 01:00:52.314
Yeah.

01:00:52.347 --> 01:00:56.484
You're right.
Only bad things can happen.

01:01:01.055 --> 01:01:02.357
You get any dudes'
numbers tonight?

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.591
-No.
-What?

01:01:03.624 --> 01:01:05.226
I was too busy dancing
with you guys.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.396
My god.

01:01:07.428 --> 01:01:08.997
We were totally
cockblocking you.

01:01:09.031 --> 01:01:11.200
Yeah, it's okay.

01:01:11.232 --> 01:01:12.533
I had
a really fun time.

01:01:12.566 --> 01:01:14.502
Yeah, me too.

01:01:15.736 --> 01:01:18.006
Me too.

01:01:22.676 --> 01:01:24.479
The fuck, man?

01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:29.150
I thought you were...

01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:35.256
Man,
I'm sorry.

01:01:42.631 --> 01:01:44.466
-I should go.
-No man, don't go.

01:01:44.499 --> 01:01:46.602
I'm sorry, I was...

01:01:46.635 --> 01:01:48.636
I'm drunk.
I thought... you don't...

01:02:40.122 --> 01:02:42.424
Chris?
What's happening?

01:02:42.457 --> 01:02:44.126
Just give me a minute.

01:02:44.158 --> 01:02:45.426
What's wrong with it?

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:46.828
Nothing's wrong with it.
Just stop talking,

01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:48.396
-you're making it worse.
-I'm sorry.

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:51.232
I've just never been
with a man who...

01:02:51.265 --> 01:02:52.633
a man who what?

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:54.703
I'm a little drunk.
Just...

01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:55.871
Ahem...

01:02:55.903 --> 01:02:57.305
Maybe if we put it
in your mouth...

01:02:57.339 --> 01:02:59.241
No, it's not
your fucking birthday.

01:02:59.274 --> 01:03:02.211
-Just suck on it.
-Why don't you have Adam suck it?

01:03:02.243 --> 01:03:03.812
Jesus.

01:03:03.845 --> 01:03:06.214
Fuck you.

01:03:06.247 --> 01:03:07.448
Wha...

01:03:07.481 --> 01:03:10.184
I was just joking.

01:03:10.218 --> 01:03:12.120
-Why are you so mad?
-I'm not mad.

01:03:13.888 --> 01:03:14.890
Wait. He didn't,
did he?

01:03:14.923 --> 01:03:16.158
No, he didn't.

01:03:16.191 --> 01:03:17.392
Did Adam suck
your cock?

01:03:17.425 --> 01:03:19.193
No he didn't fucking
suck my dick.

01:03:19.227 --> 01:03:21.396
-Jesus Christ.
-And you liked it, didn't you?

01:03:21.428 --> 01:03:22.396
No, just stop talking
about it.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:23.632
How 'bout that?

01:03:23.664 --> 01:03:24.666
Fine.

01:03:33.707 --> 01:03:36.177
You have one new
voice message.

01:03:37.178 --> 01:03:38.914
First voice message.

01:03:38.946 --> 01:03:40.214
Hey Chris, it's me.

01:03:40.247 --> 01:03:41.883
I can't believe
that happened.

01:03:41.917 --> 01:03:43.919
I'm so fucking sorry,
I'm an idiot.

01:03:43.952 --> 01:03:45.587
I'm... i was drunk.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.688
And I just...

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.923
I don't know
what I thought

01:03:47.955 --> 01:03:50.126
but can you just
call me back, please?

01:04:00.568 --> 01:04:02.370
Message deleted.

01:04:26.528 --> 01:04:27.963
Hey man,
where the fuck are you?

01:04:27.995 --> 01:04:29.731
We're playing
flag football at four.

01:04:29.763 --> 01:04:32.533
Yeah,
I don't know, man.

01:04:32.566 --> 01:04:33.734
Is Chris
gonna be there?

01:04:33.767 --> 01:04:34.802
What? What's going
on with you two?

01:04:34.836 --> 01:04:35.803
He asked me
the same thing?

01:04:35.836 --> 01:04:37.605
Well, what'd you say?

01:04:37.638 --> 01:04:40.209
I said, "yeah. Our undefeated
season is on the line."

01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:45.580
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll totally...

01:04:45.613 --> 01:04:47.915
Yeah, man.

01:04:47.948 --> 01:04:49.417
Okay. See you then.

01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:24.479
-I'm really glad you called.
-Yeah.

01:06:24.511 --> 01:06:25.814
What are you doing
for the fourth of July?

01:06:25.847 --> 01:06:27.482
'Cause you should
come over.

01:06:27.515 --> 01:06:30.018
My wife makes the most
amazing potato salad.

01:06:30.051 --> 01:06:31.486
And I could totally sneak
some down to you

01:06:31.519 --> 01:06:33.488
after the fireworks.

01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:37.492
I don't know. I think
I'm gonna go to a party.

01:06:37.524 --> 01:06:39.360
Okay, really? 'Cause
you don't sound so sure.

01:06:40.495 --> 01:06:42.397
Yeah, it's just...

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:46.033
I usually go with Chris,
my ex-fiancï¾‰.

01:06:46.066 --> 01:06:48.436
But I don't know.

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:49.937
I don't think
he wants me there.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:52.039
Okay.
What, does he own you?

01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:53.908
-He owns you?
-No.

01:06:53.941 --> 01:06:55.510
Who cares
what he thinks.

01:06:55.542 --> 01:06:57.812
I do.

01:06:57.845 --> 01:06:58.914
So you've still got
it real bad

01:06:58.946 --> 01:07:00.749
for this guy,
don't you?

01:07:00.781 --> 01:07:02.850
He must really know
how to get you off good.

01:07:02.883 --> 01:07:05.386
No, man. Why? No. Not
everything's about sex.

01:07:05.419 --> 01:07:07.822
Okay, then what's
it about?

01:07:07.856 --> 01:07:10.658
I miss him.

01:07:11.926 --> 01:07:13.761
Does he know
how you feel?

01:07:13.794 --> 01:07:15.796
'Cause you gotta
communicate.

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:18.567
Communication is the key
to any healthy relationship.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.769
Really?
And how would you know?

01:07:20.801 --> 01:07:23.972
How would I know? I've been
happily married for 17 years.

01:07:24.004 --> 01:07:25.006
That's how I'd know.

01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:30.378
What do you say
we go in the bathroom

01:07:30.412 --> 01:07:31.613
and suck
each other off?

01:08:14.622 --> 01:08:15.822
It smells really good in here.

01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:19.426
What did you guys
have for dinner?

01:08:19.461 --> 01:08:20.627
Is that what you came over
at 10:00 at night

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:21.763
to talk about?

01:08:28.602 --> 01:08:30.971
I'm really sorry
if you're ashamed of me.

01:08:32.906 --> 01:08:34.042
Is that
what you think?

01:08:34.073 --> 01:08:36.510
We're ashamed of you?

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:38.011
I'm not ashamed of you.

01:08:38.046 --> 01:08:39.647
I'm pissed off.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.084
You kept a whole part
of your life from us.

01:08:44.017 --> 01:08:45.453
How long have you known?

01:08:45.486 --> 01:08:46.587
I don't know,
like...

01:08:48.589 --> 01:08:51.493
-Like ten years.
-Ten years?

01:08:51.524 --> 01:08:53.194
My god.
I should've known.

01:08:53.227 --> 01:08:54.962
A mother should
know these things.

01:08:54.995 --> 01:08:59.200
I didn't even know.
I just...

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:00.554
I just knew that
I felt different.

01:09:03.537 --> 01:09:05.138
And I didn't know
why boobs were so cool.

01:09:06.106 --> 01:09:07.841
You still
could've told me.

01:09:07.876 --> 01:09:09.144
I wanted to,
but I just...

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:11.979
You always mentioned
girlfriends.

01:09:12.011 --> 01:09:13.113
I thought
you were shy.

01:09:15.182 --> 01:09:17.819
I am.

01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:19.620
I'm gay.
And I'm shy.

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:20.656
Well, I don't care.

01:09:22.089 --> 01:09:23.189
I don't care
if you're the gayest,

01:09:23.223 --> 01:09:26.127
shyest kid
in all of America.

01:09:26.158 --> 01:09:28.595
You're my son.
And I love you.

01:09:37.238 --> 01:09:38.272
I love you too.

01:09:40.173 --> 01:09:42.743
Just don't ever do that
to one of my sausages again.

01:09:42.776 --> 01:09:44.912
Okay.

01:09:48.048 --> 01:09:50.118
Honey, is there anything
you want to add?

01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:55.891
I'll get the iced tea.

01:10:06.266 --> 01:10:08.636
I... heard the ortus are
getting the good fireworks

01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:10.204
this year.

01:10:10.238 --> 01:10:13.307
Shipped all the way
from China.

01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:16.745
Yeah. I don't think
I'm gonna go.

01:10:16.778 --> 01:10:18.980
Did you forget
to rsvp?

01:10:19.012 --> 01:10:21.917
'Cause you know you can't get
the good ribs unless you rsvp.

01:10:21.949 --> 01:10:23.718
Yeah,
that's what I hear.

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:30.324
I screwed up.

01:10:30.357 --> 01:10:33.028
I screwed up big time, dad.

01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:35.597
Just keep being yourself.

01:10:35.629 --> 01:10:36.829
And if you get hungry tomorrow,

01:10:38.165 --> 01:10:40.901
you can have some of my ribs.

01:10:40.935 --> 01:10:43.038
Okay?

01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:45.073
Yeah.

01:11:14.735 --> 01:11:16.637
Let's go, Chris.

01:11:16.671 --> 01:11:20.909
Our reservation
is in less than 30 minutes.

01:11:20.941 --> 01:11:23.645
Okay, 30 minutes is plenty of
time to get to cheesecake factory.

01:11:43.431 --> 01:11:44.633
Adam.

01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:47.267
Hey.

01:11:47.301 --> 01:11:49.971
Dorothy cuda.
Wow. You look great.

01:11:50.003 --> 01:11:51.071
-Thank you.
-How are you?

01:11:51.105 --> 01:11:52.073
-Really good.
-Good.

01:11:52.105 --> 01:11:54.642
Yeah. How are you?

01:11:54.676 --> 01:11:56.910
Good. I'm good.

01:11:56.944 --> 01:11:59.948
I'm gay now. In case my
mom didn't tell everybody.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.382
She did.
I... i heard.

01:12:01.415 --> 01:12:02.618
-I'm sure.
-Yeah.

01:12:03.717 --> 01:12:05.319
Is it true,

01:12:05.352 --> 01:12:07.154
you shoved a sausage
down your...

01:12:08.221 --> 01:12:09.423
Yep. Yep.

01:12:09.457 --> 01:12:12.660
-Yeah?
-I did that.

01:12:12.694 --> 01:12:14.294
Happens to everybody.
Right?

01:12:14.328 --> 01:12:15.864
Does it?

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:18.632
Do you wanna go
to the party?

01:12:22.704 --> 01:12:25.006
Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:25.038 --> 01:12:26.040
Let's do it.

01:12:35.016 --> 01:12:36.451
Okay, I'll see ya.

01:12:40.253 --> 01:12:42.189
Dude, did you really just do a
casual slow-mo walk up in here

01:12:42.222 --> 01:12:43.190
with Dorothy cuda?

01:12:43.223 --> 01:12:44.426
Are you straight now?

01:12:44.458 --> 01:12:46.860
No. Definitely,
definitely still gay.

01:12:46.894 --> 01:12:49.164
Thank god. So you're gonna put
in a good word for me, right?

01:12:49.196 --> 01:12:51.165
She's way out
of your league, Nick.

01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:52.434
What do you know,
you're with that idiot.

01:12:52.467 --> 01:12:56.037
Yeah. Happy fourth
of July, dipshits.

01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:57.105
Welcome to the ortus'.

01:12:57.137 --> 01:12:58.105
Baby, you like my outfit?

01:12:58.138 --> 01:12:59.373
You're so sexy.

01:12:59.406 --> 01:13:01.376
Just like a burly
Benjamin Franklin.

01:13:01.409 --> 01:13:03.912
Did you guys know Benjamin
Franklin died of syphilis?

01:13:03.945 --> 01:13:05.113
Fact. He did.

01:13:05.145 --> 01:13:06.847
Hey, well worth
the risk.

01:13:09.016 --> 01:13:11.086
So do you guys know
where Chris is?

01:13:11.119 --> 01:13:15.056
I texted earlier, but he's
being flaky as shit, so...

01:13:15.088 --> 01:13:17.357
Yeah. I haven't talked
to him for a while,

01:13:17.391 --> 01:13:18.793
but I'm sure
he's gonna show up.

01:13:18.825 --> 01:13:19.961
What's going on
with you two guys?

01:13:19.994 --> 01:13:21.763
Dude, it's
freakin' Jess. Okay?

01:13:21.796 --> 01:13:23.897
She's got him by the
balls. Power of the pussy.

01:13:23.931 --> 01:13:25.900
You have no idea
how dangerous it could be.

01:13:25.932 --> 01:13:27.334
Have you guys
fucking read MacBeth?

01:13:37.477 --> 01:13:39.247
Can you please
turn the radio down?

01:13:39.279 --> 01:13:40.279
I can't even think.

01:13:44.017 --> 01:13:46.754
Is that a prius
with two kayaks on it?

01:13:46.788 --> 01:13:48.790
Who the fuck cares?

01:13:57.899 --> 01:13:58.967
And a "save the whales"
bumper sticker.

01:13:58.999 --> 01:14:00.935
What are you doing?

01:14:00.967 --> 01:14:04.372
The cheesecake factory is on
the other side of the mall.

01:14:04.404 --> 01:14:07.307
Do me a favor,
hand me that hockey stick.

01:14:07.341 --> 01:14:10.912
I am not walking
all the way over there.

01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:25.293
Chris, I am sick
of your bullshit.

01:14:25.325 --> 01:14:27.294
Get back
in the car, limp-dick.

01:14:27.328 --> 01:14:28.997
We're going
to be late.

01:14:33.935 --> 01:14:36.370
Jessica, I think
we should break up.

01:14:36.404 --> 01:14:37.405
Forever.

01:14:42.176 --> 01:14:44.279
Sorry about this.

01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:46.013
Maybe not.

01:14:51.052 --> 01:14:52.086
All right.

01:14:59.526 --> 01:15:00.796
Hey, is she looking?

01:15:04.865 --> 01:15:06.600
No, man.

01:15:06.633 --> 01:15:09.102
Fuck you, man.

01:15:09.136 --> 01:15:10.136
Aw, fuck.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.077
Hey. I'm sorry
about the other day.

01:15:17.477 --> 01:15:18.677
-The sausage thing.
-It's okay.

01:15:19.946 --> 01:15:22.083
Cookie?

01:15:22.115 --> 01:15:24.151
-Go ahead, take two.
-Okay.

01:15:24.185 --> 01:15:25.620
Today we're all
on the same side.

01:15:25.653 --> 01:15:27.088
-Whose, god's?
-No.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.289
Don't be silly.
America's.

01:15:29.323 --> 01:15:31.626
Do you think your gay lovers
would want some cookies?

01:15:31.659 --> 01:15:33.494
What did you call us?

01:15:33.526 --> 01:15:34.561
Is that
chocolate chip?

01:15:34.595 --> 01:15:36.030
Oatmeal raisin.

01:15:36.062 --> 01:15:37.397
The vegetable
of cookies.

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.177
-Here you go, man.
-Thank you very much.

01:15:52.913 --> 01:15:54.214
Attention.
Attention everyone.

01:15:54.248 --> 01:15:55.516
I've got
an announcement.

01:15:55.548 --> 01:15:57.084
Are the ribs ready?

01:15:57.118 --> 01:15:59.053
No father O'Malley,
they're not ready yet.

01:15:59.086 --> 01:16:01.189
I promise you won't
miss out this year. Okay?

01:16:01.221 --> 01:16:03.223
If we could just get the
music turned down a little bit,

01:16:03.257 --> 01:16:04.392
I just want
to say something.

01:16:05.426 --> 01:16:07.428
Guys?

01:16:07.461 --> 01:16:09.062
You guys know
what that means, right?

01:16:09.096 --> 01:16:10.064
What's up, Chris?

01:16:10.096 --> 01:16:11.064
-Hey.
-Hey beautiful.

01:16:11.097 --> 01:16:12.199
How are you?

01:16:12.232 --> 01:16:13.968
What am I fucking
wood here?

01:16:15.136 --> 01:16:17.004
Hey, man.
You came.

01:16:17.038 --> 01:16:18.973
Yeah, well,
I rsvp'd, so...

01:16:19.006 --> 01:16:19.973
Where's Jess?

01:16:20.007 --> 01:16:21.910
We broke up.

01:16:21.943 --> 01:16:23.945
What does that mean? You're
not gonna fuck her anymore?

01:16:23.977 --> 01:16:26.480
I don't think I could
fuck her if I wanted to.

01:16:26.513 --> 01:16:28.593
That's awesome, man. You
can do way better than Jess.

01:16:29.684 --> 01:16:32.119
What's that supposed
to mean?

01:16:32.153 --> 01:16:33.186
You guys weren't right
for each other.

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.655
You didn't
even like her.

01:16:34.689 --> 01:16:36.290
How do you know how I feel?
You don't know shit.

01:16:36.324 --> 01:16:38.059
Don't talk to me like that.
You said you hated her.

01:16:38.092 --> 01:16:40.261
You told me you were straight
our whole fucking lives

01:16:40.293 --> 01:16:41.314
and then you tried
to make out with me.

01:16:41.315 --> 01:16:41.995
What? When did that happen?

01:16:42.029 --> 01:16:43.531
No, I thought you were
trying to kiss me...

01:16:43.564 --> 01:16:45.432
-man, fucking get over it.
-Get over it?

01:16:45.466 --> 01:16:47.334
I was sad and desperate, I
would've tried it with anybody.

01:16:47.368 --> 01:16:49.637
I'm not anybody, dude.
I'm your best fucking friend.

01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:51.538
-Hey. Hey. Hey.
-I'm so sorry

01:16:51.571 --> 01:16:53.240
-that my being gay inconvenienced you.
-Hey, guys...

01:16:53.274 --> 01:16:54.242
why didn't you tell me
you were gay

01:16:54.275 --> 01:16:55.376
20 fucking years ago?

01:16:55.409 --> 01:16:56.477
I was three.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:58.178
Jesus, come on.

01:16:58.212 --> 01:16:59.981
The ribs are ready.

01:17:00.013 --> 01:17:03.450
Dad, terrible timing, okay.
I'm sorry.

01:17:03.484 --> 01:17:07.588
Look, guys. Cheer the fuck
up. It's fourth of July.

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:11.725
We're here gathered today to
celebrate our country's independence.

01:17:11.758 --> 01:17:13.226
Red, white and blue.

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.064
Ribs, beer, friends,
family, whatever.

01:17:16.096 --> 01:17:18.398
But the most important
thing to me right now is that

01:17:18.431 --> 01:17:20.068
I don't wanna be
independent anymore.

01:17:21.769 --> 01:17:25.472
Michelle Valentino,
can we stop fucking around,

01:17:25.506 --> 01:17:27.575
and make me the luckiest
man that ever lived?

01:17:27.607 --> 01:17:28.709
Will you marry me?

01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:33.414
-Yes.
-Good answer.

01:17:35.682 --> 01:17:37.584
Do I know what I'm doing?
I don't know.

01:17:40.454 --> 01:17:41.990
You're gonna be
an ortu.

01:17:47.494 --> 01:17:48.695
Congratulations.

01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:50.731
Dad, please put
the ribs down.

01:17:53.367 --> 01:17:55.369
Holy shit.

01:17:55.403 --> 01:17:57.038
Did that just happen?

01:17:59.205 --> 01:18:01.775
Yeah.

01:18:01.809 --> 01:18:04.479
Jesus, man. How long have
we not been hanging out?

01:18:04.512 --> 01:18:06.314
I don't know, man.
A really fucking long time.

01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:10.618
Hey. Happy fourth of July.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.254
What are you
doing here?

01:18:14.288 --> 01:18:15.991
Adam invited me
actually.

01:18:18.324 --> 01:18:19.526
Surprise.

01:18:21.462 --> 01:18:23.462
Sorry, I don't think you
guys have been introduced.

01:18:24.731 --> 01:18:26.533
Chris. This is Rachel.

01:18:28.369 --> 01:18:31.506
Rachel. This is Chris.

01:18:31.538 --> 01:18:32.738
It's nice to meet you, Rachel.

01:18:34.675 --> 01:18:37.111
We're getting married!

01:18:38.579 --> 01:18:40.448
Are you gonna be okay?

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.184
That must have come
as quite a shock to you.

01:18:44.217 --> 01:18:45.619
You two looked
so happy together.

01:18:47.788 --> 01:18:50.725
Seriously.

01:18:50.757 --> 01:18:52.559
This is gonna
change everything.

01:18:52.592 --> 01:18:53.560
Hey guys.
What's going on?

01:18:53.593 --> 01:18:54.529
Did we miss anything?

01:18:54.561 --> 01:18:55.762
Don't worry, Karen.

01:18:55.796 --> 01:18:56.798
The party's
just getting started.

01:18:56.830 --> 01:19:00.068
May I have
this dance, mom?

01:19:00.101 --> 01:19:02.270
-What do you say, Rachel?
-What just 'cause you know my name now,

01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:03.503
you think I'm gonna
dance with you?

01:19:03.537 --> 01:19:04.704
Well, it is dance party.

01:19:04.738 --> 01:19:06.707
Okay, we'll see
what you got.

01:19:06.739 --> 01:19:08.542
Hey, Nick.
Do you wanna dance?

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:13.815
Yes.

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:15.887
So, Adam. When are we
gonna see you with a nice boy?

01:19:16.516 --> 01:19:18.718
I don't know, mom.

01:20:33.226 --> 01:20:35.863
I can't believe we burned
through $800 worth of fireworks

01:20:35.895 --> 01:20:37.164
in 12 minutes.

01:20:38.199 --> 01:20:39.467
It's money well spent.

01:20:39.499 --> 01:20:40.502
Yeah.

01:20:48.943 --> 01:20:50.878
Man, I'm really sorry

01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:51.811
about everything.

01:20:51.812 --> 01:20:53.614
No, you don't have to
be sorry, man. I'm sorry.

01:20:53.646 --> 01:20:55.272
No, you guys have been really
cool about this whole time.

01:20:55.273 --> 01:20:55.815
Adam.

01:20:55.848 --> 01:20:57.030
I was stupid and I
didn't even mean to.

01:20:57.031 --> 01:20:57.818
I shouldn't have acted like

01:20:57.851 --> 01:20:58.396
it was such a big deal.

01:20:58.397 --> 01:20:59.487
I was lonely, and if
I could take it back,

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.222
-I would. But I can't
-it wasn't a big deal.

01:21:01.254 --> 01:21:03.254
-It was my fault...
-so, can we just forget that...

01:21:08.895 --> 01:21:10.897
how did that feel?

01:21:10.931 --> 01:21:12.367
Honestly?

01:21:15.436 --> 01:21:16.871
Like kissing my brother.

01:21:19.573 --> 01:21:20.841
-You sure?
-Yeah.

01:21:20.873 --> 01:21:21.876
-Dude, it's okay.
-No, I'm...

01:21:21.909 --> 01:21:23.545
listen, I'm sure.

01:21:26.379 --> 01:21:28.615
Are we good?

01:21:28.649 --> 01:21:30.318
Yeah, man.
We're good.

01:21:30.351 --> 01:21:32.353
Good.

01:21:33.686 --> 01:21:35.046
Told you he wanted
to fuck me most.

01:21:39.827 --> 01:21:41.829
You never listen, Chris.

01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:11.525
I guess I never met
a real life gay dude before.

01:22:11.557 --> 01:22:13.493
I went to high school with a couple
of guys that used to make out,

01:22:13.526 --> 01:22:15.863
but that was
just for weed.

01:22:15.895 --> 01:22:16.997
And then one time
at a party,

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:19.466
they gave
each other handys.

01:22:19.499 --> 01:22:22.403
That was just for...

01:22:22.436 --> 01:22:23.904
Actually, those two guys
might have been gay.

01:22:23.936 --> 01:22:25.336
-Yeah, I think they were gay.
-Yeah.

01:22:29.409 --> 01:22:30.644
Hey, Ronnie.
I got it.

01:22:30.677 --> 01:22:35.882
-Eat your sandwich.
-See that?

01:22:35.915 --> 01:22:37.551
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:22:37.583 --> 01:22:39.986
Do you remember me?
I came in about a month ago.

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:42.723
Yeah. Definitely
remember you.

01:22:42.756 --> 01:22:43.891
Is everything
all right?

01:22:43.923 --> 01:22:46.026
Yeah. Everything's great.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.462
Actually until somebody
smacked this off my car.

01:22:48.494 --> 01:22:50.664
No way.
Seriously?

01:22:50.698 --> 01:22:51.798
Who would do that?

01:22:51.832 --> 01:22:53.668
I have no idea.

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.935
I mean, you don't
need it to drive, but...

01:22:55.968 --> 01:22:57.337
If you want,
I can put it back on.

01:22:57.370 --> 01:22:59.039
It just quiets the exhaust.

01:22:59.073 --> 01:23:00.740
It would take
a couple minutes.

01:23:00.774 --> 01:23:02.642
Yeah.
That'd be great.

01:23:02.676 --> 01:23:05.780
Yeah? Okay.

01:23:05.812 --> 01:23:06.980
I'm Adam,
by the way.

01:23:08.548 --> 01:23:09.984
Matt.

01:23:10.016 --> 01:23:12.485
Matt. Cool.

01:23:12.519 --> 01:23:13.519
Very cool.
