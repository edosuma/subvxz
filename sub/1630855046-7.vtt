02:33.570 --> 02:36.823
That was great, so--
Okay, so E to A would be nice,

02:36.823 --> 02:41.369
but if you go E to C-sharp minor
then you'll really feel the Holy Spirit.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.580
Yo, great set, Danny.
- Yo, you too, brother.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.456
- I'll see you at the potluck?
For sure.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.293
I asked a billion times.
Do you want me to beg for a diaper?

02:48.293 --> 02:51.462
Then we'll drive
three more miles to the Whole Foods.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.257
- They have them. You're making a scene.
- They do not.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.306
I heard they're fighting a lot.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.517
Dang, Keanu. Dodged hella bullets.

03:04.517 --> 03:08.479
Paul, that's not how we react to a brother
and sister going through a tough time.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.232
We pray for them. Right, guys?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.277
You're such a good leader.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.467
Oh, thanks, Betty.
I can finish the laundry.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.428
It's okay, Miss Amy. I can do it.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.597
No, no. Come on. You relax.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.141
Did I do something wrong?

03:46.309 --> 03:49.896
Oh, my God, no. I was just trying to help.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.689
Because I am doing something wrong.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.400
No, not at all. I--

03:54.943 --> 03:57.779
You know what,
please forget I said anything.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.155
I'm gonna go check on Junie.

04:06.996 --> 04:11.501
Hey, babe. I think we should stop having
Betty come out to the vacation home.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.003
Did she do something wrong?

04:14.003 --> 04:16.464
What? No, it--

04:16.464 --> 04:20.760
She just does so much for us.
And, you know, I feel guilty.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.804
Babe, that's her job.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.390
You've been wanting
a full-time nanny forever.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.518
Yeah, I know, but, you know,
now that we do, it--

04:29.394 --> 04:31.104
I feel like I don't help out enough.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.063
Amy.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.608
You bought this. You helped.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.611
You helped too. The Tamago?

04:38.611 --> 04:40.530
It did help close the deal.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.992
- I guess I did save the day, huh?
- Yeah, you did.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.577
Hey, are you consulting tomorrow?

04:47.161 --> 04:50.498
Uh, I have some meetings,
but I can reschedule them.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.416
What's up?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.961
Junie, do you wanna tell Mommy
what you told me?

04:55.586 --> 04:57.672
I wanna stay longer!

04:57.672 --> 04:59.799
Yeah, honey? You like the vacation home?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.926
Yep. Luca loves it!

05:01.926 --> 05:03.553
Okay, well, one more night

05:03.553 --> 05:06.264
and then we gotta go back
for Daddy's party tomorrow, okay?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.725
We love that Mommy
gets to work whenever she wants.

05:08.725 --> 05:12.895
- Right, Junie?
- Yep. Thank God the deal closed.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.732
Oh, my God, we probably
talked about that way too much.

05:15.732 --> 05:19.777
Junie, there's more important things
in life than deals and money, okay?

05:19.777 --> 05:22.322
- There's love, sweetheart.
Okay!

05:23.197 --> 05:25.867
God, we are so lucky.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.621
We sure are.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.087
Isn't this nice? Right?

05:38.087 --> 05:39.380
Mom, look over here.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.843
The kitchen. LG appliance.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.848
And I got you a rice cooker.
Listen to this.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.061
<i>That song is a bit weird.</i>

05:53.061 --> 05:54.145
Dad...

05:54.145 --> 05:56.314
...it's the best song
of the 21st century.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.941
<i>We already have a rice cooker.</i>

05:58.941 --> 06:00.818
Okay. Okay, no problem.

06:00.943 --> 06:06.199
Um, this outlet has a USB.
I did all the wiring.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.242
Because your house has to be perfect.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.827
<i>Looks good, Danny.</i>

06:09.827 --> 06:12.038
<i>How's Paul? Is he good?</i>

06:12.997 --> 06:14.248
Paul's fine.

06:14.248 --> 06:18.044
<i>Now that you have Esther,
you need to introduce Paul to some girls.</i>

06:18.044 --> 06:19.545
Mom. Mom...

06:19.545 --> 06:22.840
I did. I did, okay?
He's still not over Kayla.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.468
I warned him about her,
but he has to learn the hard way.

06:25.468 --> 06:31.015
Oh, Mom.
Look at this vase. It's nice, right? Wow.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.976
<i>That's weird too. We have to pack now.</i>

06:33.976 --> 06:36.020
<i>See you and Paul tomorrow.</i>

06:36.020 --> 06:38.481
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>
Okay. Bye.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.573
Paul. Did you order Mom and Dad
<i>Travel + Leisure?</i>

06:47.573 --> 06:50.284
<i>No, what the fuck is that?</i>
- It's a magazine.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.702
<i>That's a magazine?</i>

06:51.702 --> 06:53.871
Well, they're sending me
bills under my name.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.373
<i>Sucks for you, dude.</i>

06:55.373 --> 07:00.336
Yeah and they got like
<i>Field & Stream, Guitar World--</i>

07:00.336 --> 07:02.547
Yo, these all sound like
things you wanna read.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.465
<i>I don't wanna read about streams.</i>

07:04.465 --> 07:06.384
- What?
<i>- I've never even been to a stream.</i>

07:06.384 --> 07:09.387
You went fishing when you were
little and you loved it, remember?

07:09.387 --> 07:12.265
<i>- I don't remember that.</i>
- And I caught the biggest one.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.433
<i>Now I know you're making shit up.</i>

07:14.433 --> 07:17.353
I'm not paying for this.
You got to cancel it.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.901
George, don't stop, I'm close.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.659
- Is everything okay?
- What?

07:33.077 --> 07:34.620
Yo, why'd you stop?

07:34.620 --> 07:37.999
Oh, babe,
I feel a recession happening, so...

07:38.791 --> 07:40.793
Come on, don't stop.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.086
It's still in.

07:42.086 --> 07:45.131
I mean, a soggy paper straw
is still in a smoothie, but it's not--

07:45.131 --> 07:47.508
- Okay. That's not gonna help.
- Yeah.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.226
- George, what's wrong?
- Amy.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.354
I have to tell you something.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.149
- Okay.
- Last year...

08:03.691 --> 08:06.986
I had an emotional entanglement.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.615
An emotional entanglement?

08:11.365 --> 08:14.452
What, do you work for Goop now?
George, what are you trying to say?

08:14.452 --> 08:18.539
Well, actually, they have a lot
of great articles on this very topic.

08:19.207 --> 08:23.586
- Did you cheat on me?
- No, I would never. I swear.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.630
I just...

08:27.507 --> 08:29.967
got emotionally connected with someone.

08:30.885 --> 08:31.761
Who?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.264
Was it someone in your men's group?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.935
Oh, my God, was it with that guy, Zane?

08:38.935 --> 08:40.728
What? No.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.151
It was with Mia.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.698
Did you fuck her?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.700
No.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.621
- It wasn't physical.
- Okay, then what was it?

08:58.621 --> 09:01.499
We're probably connected
in the spiritual realm.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.710
Have you ever heard of a divine twin?

09:04.710 --> 09:08.589
No, George, I have never heard
of a divine fucking twin.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.759
This isn't Dungeons & Dragons,
you don't have to make up lore.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.052
It's not lore.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.221
We're all energy and...

09:16.389 --> 09:18.641
some people connect on a deeper level.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.894
Did you say "I love you"?

09:26.941 --> 09:27.817
I did.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.489
Wow.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.286
Nothing happened, okay?

09:38.286 --> 09:41.080
We stopped talking
once the store got acquired.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.043
You've been so much more open
with me since the deal closed and...

09:47.128 --> 09:48.379
I wanna do the same.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.091
I don't want to hide ever.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.598
I get it.

09:59.765 --> 10:00.600
Wait.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.059
Really?

10:04.061 --> 10:05.229
No, no.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.110
I mean, I'm still really upset.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.528
Of course. I--

10:13.904 --> 10:15.990
I'd be too, if I was in your shoes.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.037
Should we set up
another appointment with Dr. Lin?

10:22.580 --> 10:23.497
Mm.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.877
What if I meet with her solo?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.715
You know, I have a lot to process, so...

10:32.715 --> 10:34.216
Whatever you need, babe.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.471
Should I cancel the party?
- No. No.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.766
You worked so hard on those pieces.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.976
People should see them.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.146
They're really good.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.483
You're so much stronger than I am.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.781
I am not ready to get back out there.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.242
- Yo, that sad boy shit gotta stop.
Yeah.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.452
Immediately.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.537
Shit ran deep.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.707
Y'all will understand
when you find that connection.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.751
I connect all the time, fool.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.961
Yeah, this dude's like
a human ethernet cable.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.922
I'm like the fucking cloud, you know?

11:12.922 --> 11:16.509
- Get the fuck out of here!
- What did we say about slamming the ball?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.552
- It's not cool.
That's what you get, dude.

11:18.552 --> 11:21.597
Guys. Can you guys
please keep it down, all right?

11:21.597 --> 11:24.433
This is a live-work space.
Some of us are working here.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.769
What? You stressed about your parents?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.354
No, my parents are great.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.523
I showed them the house.
They're super proud.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.275
They should be.
We worked our asses off for eight months.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.152
Yeah, but we can't relax right now.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.655
Okay, we got to keep
expanding the business.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.408
Dude, it's the law of diminishing returns.
We can relax.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.493
Yeah. Danny, it's the law.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.954
It's the law.
- No, you don't understand, okay?

11:44.954 --> 11:47.790
This could all go away, all right?

11:47.790 --> 11:50.668
Construction is a crazy business,
like, you never know.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.586
Trust me,
I've been doing this a long time.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.008
Yo, it's Edwin.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.097
- I love the place.
- Thank you.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.642
Uh, so Paul moved out.

12:06.642 --> 12:10.521
Yeah, he's growing up.
Paul got a spot down the hall.

12:12.022 --> 12:12.898
How's the fam?

12:15.067 --> 12:18.904
You know, truthfully, it's been rough
since I had to resign from Praise Team.

12:19.738 --> 12:20.573
Right.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.992
Yeah, plus the new kid.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.078
They don't warn you
about the price tag on those things.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.621
Mm-hm. Hmm.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.791
So, what brings you in?

12:30.791 --> 12:33.210
Um, you got renovations
you're thinking about?

12:37.465 --> 12:38.549
Look...

12:40.342 --> 12:43.596
Whatever you guys are doing here,
you're doing it right.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.307
And I'd love to be a part of it.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.184
Oh, like a job.

12:48.809 --> 12:49.727
Um...

12:50.478 --> 12:52.521
Do you have construction experience?

12:53.564 --> 12:55.357
No. No, I mean...

12:57.026 --> 12:59.487
Whatever you guys are up to,

13:00.070 --> 13:01.906
I'm sure I can learn fast.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.867
I know I may seem all buttoned up,

13:04.867 --> 13:08.120
but I'm willing
to get my hands dirty, you know?

13:10.456 --> 13:11.874
Wait, you mean like--?

13:11.874 --> 13:15.085
Yeah, you mean like hands dirty
from all the construction?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.923
Sure, construction.

13:18.923 --> 13:19.840
Yeah.

13:20.716 --> 13:24.178
- Whatever you wanna call it.
- Yeah. Nah, I don't read the dictionary.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.388
I mean, construction's construction.

13:28.724 --> 13:29.725
Sorry.

13:31.185 --> 13:35.022
It's just your parents' new house,
Paul's new place, that...

13:36.106 --> 13:39.109
That can't just be
from construction, right?

13:40.611 --> 13:44.406
I heard your cousin was into some stuff
before he went to prison.

13:45.991 --> 13:50.621
Well, Isaac had a legitimate
import-export business,

13:50.621 --> 13:52.373
if that's what you're talking about.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.334
And we're storing some of his stuff...

13:56.043 --> 13:57.920
you know, until he gets back.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.714
And we pray every day
that his sentence gets shortened.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.053
So those are just rice cookers.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.722
Yeah, here, have one.

14:08.722 --> 14:09.890
- On me.
No.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.726
It's okay. We have one.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.104
You don't got one
that plays Kelly Clarkson.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.692
Everything's above board here, man.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.154
I built my parents that house
with a lot of hard work.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.157
So sorry to disappoint you.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.123
Understood.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.592
Wow, that's a lot to process.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.929
I mean, it's not like I was a saint
to be around during that time, so...

14:50.681 --> 14:52.808
I mean, it's not easy, but I get it.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.269
I really do.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.522
Your love for George is powerful.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.732
It is.

15:00.941 --> 15:05.362
You know, I still remember
that first year we were dating.

15:07.656 --> 15:11.702
It honestly felt like
I was high every single day.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.957
It is rare to find someone
who can make you feel that way.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.000
Right?

15:19.376 --> 15:20.586
I mean, so rare.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.049
It's worth holding onto, I think.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.178
George really felt like a missing piece.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.931
Everything I'm not, he is.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.059
And thank God, you know,
because for so long

15:35.643 --> 15:38.896
I was worried about
passing down all my negative traits.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.693
I really thought
I was doing the world a favor by, uh...

15:45.611 --> 15:46.946
by not reproducing.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.702
But then I met George.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.041
And I thought maybe...

16:00.334 --> 16:03.754
well, just maybe,
if we could take the best parts of him...

16:06.131 --> 16:08.133
and the salvageable parts of me...

16:10.678 --> 16:12.680
that we could make something nice.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.890
And we did.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.226
Junie's perfect.

16:18.268 --> 16:21.355
So how lucky am I to have George, right?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.401
Why on earth would I throw that away?

16:28.445 --> 16:32.157
Is it just his relationship with Mia
that gives you doubt?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.952
I think so. Yeah.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.370
Amy.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.499
You're not throwing anything away
by opening up in here.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.548
Hey, Dr. Lin, um...

16:52.177 --> 16:53.762
Do you, uh...?

16:56.056 --> 16:58.183
Do you really think it's possible...

17:00.269 --> 17:03.480
to love someone unconditionally?

17:05.941 --> 17:06.942
What do you mean?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.487
Well, uh...

17:13.032 --> 17:15.909
You know, there must be some point where--

17:16.452 --> 17:19.830
where we all, like,
fall outside the reach of love, right?

17:19.830 --> 17:23.542
Like, the mistake is so big and then--

17:23.542 --> 17:25.085
And then the love has to stop.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.216
Did you ever feel
like your parents did that?

17:34.428 --> 17:37.514
No. I know my parents loved me.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.516
They showed me that through sacrifice.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.102
But did their love ever feel conditional?

17:44.938 --> 17:49.193
Um, I was talking more
about me with this, whole...

17:50.027 --> 17:51.445
Mia situation.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.531
How difficult
it's been for me to look past it.

17:58.994 --> 17:59.828
Okay.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.541
<i>Where does the time go, dude?</i>

18:05.375 --> 18:06.543
Life, man.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.759
I read that time speeds up
as you get older,

18:13.759 --> 18:15.886
because when you're a year old,

18:15.886 --> 18:19.139
that year is a hundred percent
of your perception of time,

18:19.139 --> 18:20.891
but as you get older,

18:20.891 --> 18:24.686
that year is a smaller fraction
of the time you've experienced.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.355
- What?

18:27.147 --> 18:28.440
Oh, dude. This--

18:28.440 --> 18:31.443
Yo, man. That's why I miss talking to you.
I miss this shit.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.112
I'm sorry. I'm a nerd.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.322
No. That's why I wanted to meet up.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.158
I don't have anybody else
to talk about this stuff.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.494
Well, why not?

18:40.494 --> 18:42.496
I just, you know...

18:42.496 --> 18:44.456
It's hard being in charge of...

18:45.833 --> 18:47.292
uh, Praise Team.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.921
We accomplished so much,

18:50.921 --> 18:52.965
but it came with a lot of costs,

18:52.965 --> 18:55.342
and it's costs that no one sees
and only I pay.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.346
They say "heavy lies the crown."

19:00.722 --> 19:04.143
Yes, yo, the crown, exactly.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.187
That's-- Dude--
I thought I'd feel different, but--

19:08.313 --> 19:10.023
The crown feels the same.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.153
What does the same feel like?

19:16.655 --> 19:19.700
I've been hustling my whole life,
you know?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.578
Like even just for like the basics.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.915
And I always thought the hustle
was like the cause of this, like...

19:27.833 --> 19:28.834
feeling, but...

19:29.793 --> 19:31.962
Now I'm starting to wonder
if it's always there.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.552
Does that make sense? Like...

19:41.388 --> 19:43.056
- You know who you should talk to?
- Ah.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.642
Western therapy doesn't work
on Eastern minds.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.687
No, you should talk to my wife.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.190
What?

19:51.190 --> 19:54.902
She's been struggling with depression
for a long time.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.904
No, no, no. I'm not depressed.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.031
She would say the same thing,

19:59.031 --> 20:01.033
but since she sold her company,

20:01.033 --> 20:04.912
she's been doing so much better.
She's much more balanced now.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.039
When life throws us a curveball...

20:07.956 --> 20:10.042
she stays so emotionally strong.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.377
Way stronger than me, even.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.881
Dude, you're so strong, though.

20:15.881 --> 20:19.259
Hey, I'm having a friends and family thing

20:19.259 --> 20:21.136
for my new pieces tonight.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.305
You should come by and meet her.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.599
I would love to see your vases again.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.643
I still think about
the ones you showed me.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.645
Dude, that's when you know it's good art.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.397
Old pieces are embarrassing.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.565
They're garbage.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.484
Oh, word?

20:40.072 --> 20:43.033
So Haru told me,
"Keep looking at the dollar bill."

20:43.033 --> 20:44.326
So I did.

20:44.326 --> 20:47.496
I stared and stared and, suddenly,

20:47.496 --> 20:50.749
I started to notice all the intricacies.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.795
The ribbon in the eagle's mouth
looked more like a serpent.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.214
The all-seeing eye of God,

20:57.214 --> 20:59.633
I had never gazed into it.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.553
It felt quite familiar. I started to cry.

21:03.553 --> 21:06.890
And I will never forget,
Haru turns to me and he goes--

21:07.808 --> 21:08.850
He goes,

21:09.559 --> 21:11.853
"Right there on the dollar bill,

21:12.604 --> 21:16.984
money declares its intent
to cheapen great art."

21:18.443 --> 21:21.822
So here we are today to celebrate,
not money,

21:21.822 --> 21:25.450
but great art made by my brilliant son,

21:25.450 --> 21:26.743
George Nakai.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.372
And I must mention his muse,

21:30.372 --> 21:33.208
his rock, his patron,

21:33.208 --> 21:34.626
Amy Lau.

21:44.553 --> 21:48.265
Honestly, I think it all kind of started
with the Tamago chair.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.475
Oh, I thought that wasn't for sale.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.894
Oh, well, my beauty here,

21:52.894 --> 21:54.187
she worked her magic

21:54.187 --> 21:56.648
and George gave me a call,
and the rest is history.

21:56.648 --> 22:00.110
I just wanted her to be happy, and, um...

22:00.110 --> 22:01.862
we know how it sounds.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.239
Sister-in-law turned fiancée.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.199
My brother is pissed,

22:06.199 --> 22:09.244
but, you know, this was meant to be.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.455
<i>Jurassic Park.</i> "Life finds a way."

22:11.455 --> 22:12.497
Yes!

22:12.497 --> 22:14.499
- That's right.
- Wow, I love that!

22:14.499 --> 22:16.418
I just watched that, so... Right.

22:16.418 --> 22:20.505
What are the chances
that Naomi would marry my brother,

22:20.505 --> 22:22.507
who is objectively repugnant,

22:22.507 --> 22:26.011
and then move to the same neighborhood
as Amy and George,

22:26.011 --> 22:29.473
who happened to have the chair
that I've been coveting for years?

22:29.473 --> 22:30.807
- That's crazy.
- Right. Yeah.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.894
It's obvious the universe
was bringing us together,

22:33.894 --> 22:36.229
- isn't that right, my soul mate?
Zane.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.773
There you are.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.650
I want you to meet my wife, Amy.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.027
Oh.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.361
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.946
Come on. Bring it in.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.157
I feel like I already know you.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.202
Yeah, nice to meet you, Zane.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.829
Hmm. I'm so sorry.
Can I use your bathroom?

22:53.663 --> 22:55.415
I drank a lot of water today.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.084
- I was parched.
By the entrance.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.461
- You can't miss it.
- He might miss it.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.505
- I'll show him.
- That's so nice.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.465
- Thank you.
You're welcome.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.469
What are you doing here?

23:07.469 --> 23:09.262
Is that new hair?

23:09.262 --> 23:10.180
I like it.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.182
What do you want, Danny?

23:13.433 --> 23:14.559
I came to talk.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.104
About what? You being a stalker?

23:17.104 --> 23:19.397
Yo, take it down.

23:19.397 --> 23:20.649
It's the old you.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.652
George said new you
is all balanced and strong.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.988
I don't appreciate you talking
to my husband.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.949
Relax. He loves me.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.996
What do you need?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.671
I just want to know if...

23:43.630 --> 23:46.967
you're like, I don't know, happy and shit.

23:48.552 --> 23:49.636
What?

23:50.262 --> 23:53.181
All your hard work paid off, right?

23:53.181 --> 23:54.516
You're fulfilled?

23:55.392 --> 23:56.852
Why do you care?

23:58.103 --> 24:00.313
I just want to know
if I've got to get to where you are.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.696
Everything fades.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.074
Nothing lasts.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.078
We're just a snake eating its own tail.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.208
Word.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.255
Just leave, please.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.479
Oh, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.132
Kayla!

25:13.053 --> 25:14.262
What the fuck?

25:18.266 --> 25:20.435
Wack-ass party. Psycho.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.110
Hey!

25:32.155 --> 25:33.657
What the fuck was that?

25:33.657 --> 25:35.283
I thought I saw Paul's ex.

25:35.283 --> 25:38.161
Yeah, I knew you weren't here
just to talk.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.414
What is this? A warning shot?
You trying to blackmail me?

25:41.414 --> 25:43.333
I don't want anything from you.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.378
I don't want anything to do with you.
You are sick.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.629
You're a disease.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.966
You think you're better than me now.
Is that it?

25:51.841 --> 25:54.636
Is that why
you let your cousin go to jail?

25:54.636 --> 25:57.222
Yeah, I heard about an anonymous tip.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.640
I wonder who.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.101
I could end you, Daniel.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.938
And things are going so well for you
with your business.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.565
At least I didn't cheat
with a fucking child.

26:08.858 --> 26:13.071
You're the reason he's a child.
You know that, right?

26:13.071 --> 26:15.699
He's just looking for guidance
from somebody, anybody,

26:15.699 --> 26:16.908
'cause you can't do it.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.743
You know what?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.954
Stay the fuck away from my family.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.832
Honestly, you should
stay away from yours too.

26:24.624 --> 26:25.834
Can you move?

26:35.051 --> 26:36.761
<i>Thank you for supporting me tonight.</i>

26:37.846 --> 26:40.765
I'm sure that wasn't easy for you after,
you know.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.225
No, it was fine.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.311
Don't worry about it.

26:45.687 --> 26:46.688
It's just...

26:47.689 --> 26:48.982
I don't deserve you.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.234
All I do is let you down.

26:53.361 --> 26:54.988
Hey, George...

26:56.031 --> 26:57.782
We need to talk about something.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.410
Oh. Okay.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.203
I don't know how you're gonna feel,

27:02.203 --> 27:05.707
but it's something
that's been on my mind for a while.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.085
Just say it.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.089
I think we should move.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.387
Whoo.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.723
I thought you were gonna say divorce.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.184
No. Oh, God, no.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.312
No, honey. It--

27:28.104 --> 27:30.231
I just think we could use a fresh start.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.816
But you love this house.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.861
- You put so much time into it.
- Ah, it's just a house.

27:34.861 --> 27:38.114
It's like we told Junie,
there's more important things in life.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.368
Do you mean move to another city?
The vacation house?

27:41.368 --> 27:42.952
Sure. Anywhere.

27:42.952 --> 27:46.122
I just want to move
as far away from here as possible

27:46.122 --> 27:48.792
and put it all behind us, you know?

27:48.792 --> 27:50.001
Clean slate.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.588
And... you'd forgive me?

27:53.588 --> 27:55.465
One hundred percent.

27:57.425 --> 28:00.261
We never have
to talk about it again, I swear.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.437
I just want us
to love each other unconditionally.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.191
Yeah? Can we do that, George?

28:13.191 --> 28:14.567
Of course.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.780
I love you so much.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.033
I love you too.

28:35.713 --> 28:36.548
Yo.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.717
What's going on? You stink up your place?

28:40.802 --> 28:42.387
Just looking over the business.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.014
Word? How's it looking?

28:46.433 --> 28:47.976
Found some accounting errors.

28:48.768 --> 28:49.602
Really?

28:50.395 --> 28:52.272
Shit, man, I'm so bad at math.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.817
There's a lot of cash we pulled in
that don't match the invoices.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.695
Yeah. I mean, it's a mess.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.113
I'm sure it's all there.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.115
We've been working our asses off, right?

29:04.409 --> 29:06.745
Yo, you're not hiding anything
from me, right?

29:07.454 --> 29:08.288
What?

29:13.251 --> 29:14.836
Why would you say that?

29:14.836 --> 29:15.879
It's just...

29:15.879 --> 29:17.881
everything Edwin was saying.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.007
Edwin?

29:19.549 --> 29:22.385
Come on, that guy's a clown.
Are you kidding me?

29:22.927 --> 29:25.764
Yo, how many times I tell you
not to leave trash in my house?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.640
I was gonna throw that away.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.434
Yo, if we're gonna be real right now?

29:29.434 --> 29:32.812
- I know you hide shit from me.
- I don't hide nothing.

29:32.812 --> 29:35.982
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah? You wanna talk about Kayla?

29:37.692 --> 29:39.611
I know about Amy, dude.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.446
Are you looking through my phone?

29:41.446 --> 29:42.947
No, I don't do that.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.574
I just saw her tonight.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.035
You saw her in person?

29:47.035 --> 29:49.746
Yeah, remember that road rage shit
I was telling you about?

29:50.288 --> 29:51.998
- Yeah.
- That's Amy.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.168
She's the one tagging my truck,
threatening our family.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.086
Fucking with me all year, man.

29:57.712 --> 29:59.631
So I met up with her to end our beef.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.508
Wait, what?

30:02.133 --> 30:03.843
Wait, so what? She was--?

30:04.552 --> 30:06.429
She was using me to get to you?

30:09.557 --> 30:11.768
Yeah, she's fucked up like that.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.854
You know what she told me about you?

30:14.854 --> 30:17.232
She said you're like a helpless child.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.859
Those are her words.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.029
Yo, I'm sorry
you got roped up into this, man.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.657
I just wish you would've told me sooner.

30:27.408 --> 30:28.326
Fuck.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.664
That's why we gotta be honest
with each other. Okay?

30:33.373 --> 30:35.542
You tell me everything.
I tell you everything.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.293
Brothers.

30:40.755 --> 30:41.965
You all right, man?

30:42.799 --> 30:44.801
You weren't really into her, were you?

30:46.553 --> 30:48.471
No, man, I don't give a shit.

30:50.723 --> 30:51.641
All right.

31:34.976 --> 31:35.894
<i>Hello?</i>

31:35.894 --> 31:36.895
<i>Are you George?</i>

31:37.770 --> 31:38.605
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:39.772 --> 31:40.899
<i>I fucked your wife.</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:41.816
<i>Excuse me?</i>

31:41.816 --> 31:44.152
<i>I got all the receipts.
I got texts, photos...</i>

31:44.152 --> 31:45.737
<i>I fucked the shit out of her.</i>

31:46.696 --> 31:47.697
<i>Nice house.</i>

31:56.497 --> 31:59.292
Danny gained a little weight.
Must be really making money.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.835
I actually lost weight.

32:00.835 --> 32:04.047
This is my muscle, man.
What are you talking about?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.131
Where's Paul?

32:05.131 --> 32:07.091
He said he'd meet us later. Let's go.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.093
We'll eat
and then I'll show you the house.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.094
Okay?

32:10.094 --> 32:12.305
We are proud of you, Danny.
Thank you so much.

32:12.305 --> 32:15.308
We are proud of you, Danny.
Thank you so much.

32:16.100 --> 32:16.976
Thank you.
