00:08.560 --> 00:10.995
He won't find you.
Reddington.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.800
If that's what you're hoping for.
Or worried about.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.552
Tom's alive. You don't have Agnes.
I'm not worried about anything.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.071
I won't apologize for trying
to restore my family.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.516
Even if it means destroying mine.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.876
Reddington, he took you from me.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.316
And you hate him for it.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.756
For stealing your child.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.953
I know how that feels.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.471
You would have been with Agnes now
if you hadn't tried to escape.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.992
Yes.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.917
But then again, so would you.

00:46.880 --> 00:47.870
Tell me.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.070
I got the girl.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.317
<i>Find a way across the Straits...</i>

00:51.680 --> 00:53.831
...then contact my office
in the Keys.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.116
Do it quickly.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.716
Agnes has been away
from her mother too long.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.516
She's gonna kill us!

01:15.720 --> 01:16.915
Hey.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.392
The child.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.279
- Have you seen Agnes?
- No.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.751
- Please assist Mr. Kaplan.
- You all right?

02:18.080 --> 02:19.673
Where are they?

02:19.920 --> 02:21.798
In danger.

02:22.000 --> 02:22.990
How did you find us?

02:23.200 --> 02:24.520
I had Aram tracking that car.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.876
I spent the better part
of the day in the trunk.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.390
Who was the driver?

02:30.560 --> 02:32.199
Had to be one
of Kirk's hired hands.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.511
Six foot. Rough trade.
Dark skin.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.672
Likes western wear.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.240
Mato. I saw his face.

02:40.760 --> 02:41.750
Who's Mato?

02:41.920 --> 02:44.719
A finder. A tracker.
A killer when necessary.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.990
How do we find him?

02:46.160 --> 02:47.310
I don't know.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.517
You don't know, or you won't say?

02:50.960 --> 02:54.078
We had a mutual friend.
He gave Mato his start as a skip tracer.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.272
- It was years ago.
- Little Nikos?

02:56.880 --> 02:59.839
I can talk to him.
If he knows anything, he'll tell me.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.191
West Texas' favorite bail bondsman.

03:02.360 --> 03:05.512
An Amarillo institution
for 25 years to life.

03:05.680 --> 03:10.391
Dembe, call Edward. Ready the jet.
We're gonna pay a visit to Little Nikos.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.673
Excuse me. Sorry.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.158
It's Mr. Reddington.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.831
We have two targets:
Elizabeth Keen and Agnes Keen.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.311
Traveling separate paths
to an unknown location.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.911
<i>Constantin Rostov,
also know as Alexander Kirk...</i>

04:06.120 --> 04:08.271
...fled with Elizabeth
in a private seaplane...

04:08.440 --> 04:12.275
...that departed from Playa Larga
less than an hour ago, due west.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.671
<i>- What about Agnes?
- I have a lead on Agnes.</i>

04:14.840 --> 04:17.719
She was abducted
by one of Kirk's private contractors.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.031
A high-priced tracker
known only as Mato.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.999
He missed the
flight off the island.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.674
Then he's trapped in Cuba.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.675
He won't get past the PNR after
the international incident you just caused.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.591
Ordinarily I would agree with you, but
Mato isn't your garden-variety mercenary.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.112
<i>From what I'm told, he's an Indian,
part Sioux, part I don't know what.</i>

04:39.280 --> 04:40.270
<i>Son of a shaman.</i>

04:40.480 --> 04:43.279
<i>Mato could sneak up
on a deer in a glade...</i>

04:43.480 --> 04:45.995
...and smack it on the rump.
He'll find his way off.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.919
We'll notify the seaports in case.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.118
Good luck and let us know
what you turn up.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.195
Contact Customs and Border Patrol.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.319
They monitor the air
and waters around Cuba.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.910
I don't understand why we're
going to such extremes...

04:59.080 --> 05:01.879
Ressler is on a return flight.
Set aside your feelings...

05:02.080 --> 05:03.560
...and help this investigation.

05:08.720 --> 05:12.236
This is my fault. If anything
happens to Elizabeth or the baby...

05:12.400 --> 05:15.154
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.956
You tried to help us find a normal life.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.756
I'd take that risk again.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.360
- I don't regret trying to get away from you.
- Of course.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.600
Regret requires age or wisdom.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.315
We were trying to protect Agnes.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.159
I guess that didn't work out.

05:34.960 --> 05:39.398
When we get to Amarillo,
I think it would be best to do as I say.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.438
Both of you.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.276
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Plane down off the coast of Havana.

05:49.480 --> 05:53.315
Twenty-three degrees,
52 minutes north...

05:53.520 --> 05:55.830
...eighty-two degrees,
49 minutes south.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.078
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Can anyone hear me?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.873
- My sat phone.
- Gone.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.272
You need to untie me, Masha.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.995
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Is anyone there?

06:08.080 --> 06:09.514
What was that?

06:11.960 --> 06:15.431
You need to know that Agnes is safe.
She'll be cared for.

06:17.840 --> 06:18.830
You see anything?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.515
One of the pontoons is taking on water.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.830
We don't have long.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.514
Untie me. Masha, I'm your father.
You can't let me drown.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.750
Watch me.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.074
We've got every sonar operator
in Miami working on this.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.072
We launched a search
as soon you called.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.959
Any chance the plane is in range?

06:42.120 --> 06:44.112
A light aircraft flying low.
We'll find it.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.476
We monitor two million
square miles of ocean.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.030
Agent Ressler, welcome back.
This is Captain Daly.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.714
He's our Coast Guard liaison.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.395
I'm authorized to give you
access to our radar screens.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.472
If it's flying low,
won't it avoid detection?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.115
Most transmitters are on the
ground aimed at the sky.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.237
Ours float in the sky on balloons
looking down.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.592
They're designed to detect small aircraft
like the one you described.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.479
If you don't mind,
who's on the plane?

07:05.640 --> 07:07.472
- A fugitive.
- A friend.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.231
Sounds complicated.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.357
When we get inside,
let me talk to him.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.590
He and I have history.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.116
He and I don't.
I'll be more persuasive.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.953
Is that what this has come to?

07:25.120 --> 07:28.113
The chance for you to punish me
by hurting someone I care about?

07:28.320 --> 07:31.552
You are not my concern,
Agnes is.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.959
If someone you care about is hurt
in the process of finding her, so be it.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.751
Do you remember
what I looked like that night...

07:38.920 --> 07:41.355
...lying in the street,
my head torn open...

07:41.560 --> 07:43.631
...Annie's body in front of me?

07:45.040 --> 07:47.999
You know I don't know what you
looked like. I was away.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.319
Right. But he does. Little Nikos
sat by my bed in the hospital.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.879
When I healed, he gave me work,
a reason to push on.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.191
He's a decent man.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.512
I'm only here to serve you today
because of his kindness.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.915
You may speak to him first.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.075
Briefly.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.312
Afternoon. Can I help you?

08:13.880 --> 08:15.200
Little Nikos, please.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.320
Wish I could oblige, miss.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.318
Mr. Kaplan. An old friend.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.120
Mr. Kaplan,
I wish I could oblige...

08:22.320 --> 08:24.596
...but Nikos is taking a little nap.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.797
Perhaps it's time for a wake-up call.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.593
I'm afraid that's not possible.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.876
He's in surgery.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.840
Where?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.195
His stomach.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.234
And where might
we find his stomach?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.360
I told him he couldn't come in.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.511
Oh, my.
Me and my timing.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.154
What the hell is going on?

08:44.360 --> 08:45.350
Is this a LAP-BAND?

08:45.520 --> 08:48.752
I knew all those desserts would catch up
to Little Nikos one day.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.520
- I think I see some baklava in there.
- Put that down.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.319
Helen, get him out of here.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.636
Call building security.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.912
I need your capable team here
to wake up your patient.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.879
- What? Call security right now.
- Wake him up.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.238
I can't. We're in a procedure.
I'd put his life in danger...

09:04.400 --> 09:05.834
His life's already in danger.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.872
How about yours?

09:10.160 --> 09:13.073
There are no life vests.
No inflatable rafts.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.080
We're gonna flip.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.040
Our only chance is out there
holding onto the pontoons.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.199
You mean my only chance.
You're not going anywhere.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.033
We're not gonna survive
unless we trust each other.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.709
I'll never trust you.

09:41.080 --> 09:45.279
We're family. Not Reddington. Us.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.115
If you want to hold your child
in your arms again...

09:48.280 --> 09:50.556
...we need to trust each other.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.070
Coast Guard just picked up
a brief ELT signal...

10:05.240 --> 10:09.314
...from a light aircraft west of Havana,
somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.871
- You telling me their plane went down?
- It appears that way, sir.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.594
But we have a location for them.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.076
It's not that simple.
This ELT is an older model.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.674
Analog frequency.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.839
- No digital signal to carry coordinates.
- ELT's are unreliable.

10:22.040 --> 10:25.920
Especially if they're
submerged underwater.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.551
We've narrowed the search
to 220 square miles.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.439
SAR teams are gearing up now.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.990
I know this is not about me,
it's about Agent Keen.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.879
I don't have the strength
to lose her again.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.799
- None of us do.
- Stay on it.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.556
Say a prayer.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.595
Notify me the minute
you have an update.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.038
He's awake and
in excruciating pain.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.551
I gave him a self-administering
morphine drip to manage his discomfort.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.310
That won't be enough unless you get
what you want quickly and leave.

10:55.440 --> 11:00.151
Remember, we're getting
what we need, one way or another.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.719
Kate.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.317
What are you...? What's happening?

11:16.520 --> 11:18.751
We only have a minute.
Raymond Reddington's here.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.838
He wants Mato.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.277
Tell me how to find Mato.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.550
No.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.871
He'll kill you if you don't.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.158
He'll kill Mato if I do.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.120
I'm not gonna hurt you, Nikos.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.749
You're a good man. Loyal.

11:49.920 --> 11:53.311
Protective of those
who are protective of you.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.671
I admire that in a person.

11:55.880 --> 12:00.159
Unfortunately for you,
I'm surrounded by people who don't.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.273
Tom, I'd like to introduce
you to Little Nikos...

12:03.480 --> 12:07.076
...the man who's protecting the sociopath
who stole your baby.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.719
Good luck with that surgery, Nick.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.478
Don't let go.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.275
No matter what. Don't let go.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.718
They're looking.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.997
The FBI. The Coast Guard.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.719
They'll find us.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.200
They'll find you.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.031
Which is enough.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.635
No. No.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.400
I told you not to let go.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.153
I can help you.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.510
It's too much.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.996
You said we have
to trust each other.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.480
Do you trust me?

13:10.280 --> 13:12.511
- Yes.
- Then hold on.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.631
They will find us.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.351
They will find us.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.431
This is my little girl.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.757
That's Agnes.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.319
I'll put this right here.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.872
Because she's the reason I'm doing this.
Remember that.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.150
I'll just take this.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.754
That's enough. Yeah.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.156
Tell me how to find Mato.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.760
I can't do that.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.111
Well, you do have guts.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.274
What do you think this does?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.793
I'm sorry it had to be Nikos.

14:31.680 --> 14:35.959
If there's no sincerity behind
your words, don't waste them.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.080
What would you have me say, Kate?

14:40.240 --> 14:42.232
Say that you understand.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.558
I didn't just give you my friend
as an act of contrition.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.960
I'm not sorry for what I did.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.231
I betrayed you for the same reason
I just betrayed Nikos:

14:53.400 --> 14:55.676
to keep Elizabeth safe.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.435
Just like you asked me to
all those years ago...

14:58.600 --> 15:01.320
...when you first put her in my
arms as a baby girl.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.030
Only now she has
a baby girl of her own...

15:05.200 --> 15:09.513
...and your existence in their lives
puts them in constant danger.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.360
Say that you understand,
or don't say anything at all.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.278
Hey, stay awake.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.874
Stay with me.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.554
Talk to me.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.792
Tell me about your parents.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.150
What were their names?

15:46.120 --> 15:47.679
Help!

15:48.160 --> 15:49.958
Over here! Help!

16:06.360 --> 16:08.955
I got a phone number and a password.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.876
"Nakaidoklini"?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.350
It's a famous medicine man,
I don't know.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.399
You text that name to that
number using Nikos' cell phone...

16:20.560 --> 16:24.474
...and Mato will show up in person
at the bail office.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.872
That's how they do it.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.560
I'm so sorry, Nikos.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.633
Kate.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.875
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.196
He needs medical attention.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.559
First aid. Do you understand?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.631
Good. Good. Show me.
He needs it right now.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.512
Why did you save me?

17:14.760 --> 17:16.240
Why?

17:16.680 --> 17:18.512
Because you know where Agnes is.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.039
Is that the only reason?

17:23.160 --> 17:25.675
Keep pressure on that leg.
You've lost a lot of blood.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.950
I saved you because of Agnes.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.274
But...

17:35.960 --> 17:39.351
...also, maybe,
because you might be telling the truth

17:41.560 --> 17:43.233
<i>Me llamo Elizabeth Keen.</i>

17:43.440 --> 17:47.480
I'm with the FBI. That man was
in my custody when our plane crashed.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.910
No, no, no. SeÃ±or, terrorist.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.990
Yes.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.552
<i>Do you have a gun.
Pistola? Pistola?</i>

18:12.080 --> 18:13.719
<i>I don't... No comprendo.</i>

18:13.920 --> 18:15.479
No, slow down.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.919
I believe he said
the pistol is in the toolbox.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.234
Come in.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.790
Coast Guard intercepted
a distress call in the Gulf.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.192
Some Cuban fishing vessel.
Keen was on board.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.350
So she's alive.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.670
You can come in, Aram.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.914
Sorry. I just wanted to hear the update,
which is the greatest update ever.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.440
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.474
But we heard her voice.
The pilot was giving coordinates...

18:52.640 --> 18:54.154
...when the transmission cut out.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.953
Why? Could you get it back?

18:56.960 --> 18:59.873
All that matters is that the
search teams have a target now.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.555
- They're gonna find that boat.
- Agent Ressler...

19:02.720 --> 19:05.189
...the signal.
What aren't you telling me?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.040
Keen's voice.

19:07.240 --> 19:11.359
The last thing we heard was her asking
if there was a gun on board.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.797
Honor the sacred.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.553
Honor the Earth...

19:19.360 --> 19:21.875
...and everyone who shares it.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.797
Honor the elders.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.315
The four-legged, the two-legged.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.631
The winged ones.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.351
The plant and animal people.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.033
Walk in beauty and balance.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.356
Oh, how beautiful.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.719
I take photo for Facebook, yeah?

19:48.640 --> 19:49.915
You don't want your money?

19:51.520 --> 19:55.230
I need to know you're gonna safely
deliver that baby to Kirk.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.840
His jet is waiting at MIA.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.078
Put the girl in Kirk's hands only.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.197
- If this man dies...
- It'll be your fault.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.278
You got him involved.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.556
I need an ETA.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.480
<i>Intercept team should reach
your position in 20 minutes.</i>

20:36.680 --> 20:37.670
<i>How many passengers?</i>

20:37.880 --> 20:41.351
Three passengers, and make sure
there's a medical team standing by.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.954
Two passengers, over.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.870
I know you were lying about
believing in me, but I promise...

20:48.040 --> 20:52.114
...once we reach our destination, you'll
know everything I've told you is true.

20:52.280 --> 20:56.320
Of course you believe that.
You're a classic narcissist.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.796
You were, what, abused as a child?
Abandoned?

20:58.960 --> 21:00.440
Made to feel powerless?

21:00.600 --> 21:03.240
You must have suffered
some sick, traumatic, dark event...

21:03.400 --> 21:05.357
...to believe the
sick, traumatic, dark things...

21:05.520 --> 21:07.876
...you've done to me
and everyone I care about...

21:08.040 --> 21:11.078
...could ever result in me loving you.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.274
You're doing fine, Maisy.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.839
He should be here any minute.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.556
Sorry about Nikos.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.474
You did your job.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.552
I know, but...

21:46.760 --> 21:48.797
...I didn't mean to...

21:50.600 --> 21:51.920
He knew where my baby was.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.680
That's the only reason
I pushed so hard.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.036
Why are you telling me this?

21:59.400 --> 22:01.471
Because he's your friend.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.517
So, you want me
to make you feel better?

22:09.240 --> 22:13.473
Everyone wants me to make things
easier for them, cleaner.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.315
That's what I am after all,
the Cleaner.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.554
Just forget I brought it up.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.360
In my desire to make life easier
for your baby...

22:22.520 --> 22:23.715
...I betrayed Raymond...

22:23.880 --> 22:26.873
...and now he doesn't know
what to do with me.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.352
Well, he knows
what he has to do...

22:31.520 --> 22:35.230
...and he wants me to make
it easier for him.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.992
But I won't.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.360
I'm not here
to make him feel better.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.911
And I'm not here
to make you feel better, Tom.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.600
I need some air.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.390
Watch it!

23:40.400 --> 23:42.039
Where's my daughter?

23:43.200 --> 23:44.680
Where's my daughter?

23:44.880 --> 23:46.200
Where is she?

23:47.000 --> 23:47.990
Where's my daughter?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.951
- Where is she?
- Tom.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.914
Let's get out of the heat.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.550
Thank you.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.797
Of course, Raymond.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.476
We found your boat
a few miles offshore.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.478
It's being escorted
to a nearby marina.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.040
Was anyone on board?

24:16.320 --> 24:18.152
Where's the survivor?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.275
Excuse me.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.075
FBI. We need a minute.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.359
Sir, the woman, the one who
was with you, where is she?

24:33.560 --> 24:35.677
He took her away in a speedboat.
Who took her away?

24:39.800 --> 24:41.393
Where the hell are they?

24:44.320 --> 24:45.515
Put Romina on the phone.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.115
I want Agnes to see her mother.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.600
Where is she?

24:49.840 --> 24:51.797
We'll all be together soon.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.276
Hi, Agnes.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.199
Hi.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.591
Did you hear that?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.079
We're gonna be together soon.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.792
I love you.

25:14.520 --> 25:18.036
This will be quick,
as I have no time and less patience.

25:18.560 --> 25:23.316
Tell me where Alexander Kirk took
Elizabeth Keen and her daughter.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.599
The strong, silent type.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.998
You're not doing much
to break down stereotypes here.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.990
I'm not afraid of pain.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.239
Or dying, I'm sure.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.720
You know, some years back...

25:37.880 --> 25:43.080
...I was hiking Devil's Tower for a bracing
dip in the spiritual vortex...

25:43.240 --> 25:46.950
...when who did I run into but the tribal
leader of the Lakota Nation...

25:47.120 --> 25:49.840
...a man of vast responsibility.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.120
He invited me to witness the extreme
version of the Sun Dance ritual.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.156
Not just anyone
can attend the Sun Dance.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.757
True. And you can't get a table at
The Fat Duck without a reservation...

26:01.920 --> 26:06.790
...but I find, in either case, a generous
donation gets you in the teepee.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.000
I watched a tribal member,
much like yourself...

26:10.200 --> 26:12.590
...suspend himself
from a cottonwood tree...

26:12.800 --> 26:14.951
...with flesh-hooks through his chest.

26:15.120 --> 26:19.433
Three hours he dangled,
skin stretched like saltwater taffy...

26:19.640 --> 26:23.031
...while he left his body to communicate
with the Great Spirit.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.591
Like you, the man on that tree
didn't fear death.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.600
But do you know what terrified him?

26:29.800 --> 26:33.191
The thought of eternity on earth...

26:33.400 --> 26:35.119
...trapped in a dark box...

26:35.320 --> 26:39.872
...surrounded by rotting flesh, forever.

26:41.200 --> 26:46.275
I hear that's why some native people
leave spirit holes in their caskets...

26:46.440 --> 26:49.911
...to allow their souls to pass on...

26:50.120 --> 26:53.909
...to the next
great hunting ground in the sky.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.477
After I shoot you, sir...

26:57.720 --> 27:01.157
...you will be locked
in an airtight, concrete crypt...

27:01.320 --> 27:06.156
...unless you tell me what I need to know
before those figures stop dancing.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.034
Kirk said they're going
to the Summer Palace.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.476
That's all I know.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.399
Yes.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.200
I know the Summer Palace.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.513
What is this place?

27:49.720 --> 27:53.714
It's yours. It belongs to you
and Agnes, of course.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.910
It's a lovely location
to raise a little girl, don't you think?

27:58.080 --> 28:00.640
The armed goons don't do much
for the landscape.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.833
The coercion was necessary
and temporary.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.760
All I ever intended
to do was show you...

28:06.920 --> 28:09.515
...to prove to you, who you are,
who I am.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.239
Then you can choose for yourself.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.760
Like a Russian fairy tale.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.559
That's right.

28:17.280 --> 28:20.637
Excuse me, Elizabeth.
I have much more to show you...

28:20.840 --> 28:23.230
...but my physician
is waiting for me.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.269
Hello, Elizabeth. My name is Katja.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.838
You can think of me
as the Palace keeper.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.193
- Palace?
- The Summer Palace.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.869
It's what Mr. Kirk calls the cottage.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.078
Anything you need during your stay,
let me know.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.196
Director Cooper.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.714
<i>I know where Elizabeth is.</i>

28:44.920 --> 28:48.072
Where Kirk is taking Agnes:
Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.

28:48.240 --> 28:53.110
Kirk owns a cottage there where he'd go
to escape the summers of Novosibirsk.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.356
Are they hurt? Injured?

28:54.520 --> 28:56.159
<i>I don't know and I can't find out.</i>

28:56.360 --> 28:57.840
I'm deep in Amarillo, Texas.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.673
How quickly can
your people get there?

28:59.920 --> 29:01.957
Agents Ressler and Navabi
are flying back.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.520
I can redirect their plane.

29:03.760 --> 29:05.831
I'll send you a location.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.516
- I'll handle this quickly.
- You always do, Kate.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.914
Can I get you something else?

29:19.080 --> 29:20.673
Yes. My daughter.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.675
I understand, Elizabeth.

29:25.920 --> 29:29.470
I know what you've been through,
but little Agnes will be here soon.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.195
And when she's here,
you will need your strength.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.838
Tell me about Kirk.
How long have you known him?

29:36.480 --> 29:38.995
I have worked here for nine years.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.992
I took over from my mother.

29:41.160 --> 29:44.551
She worked my entire childhood
maintaining the Summer Palace.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.395
- So, you know him well.
- No, actually, I don't.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.279
He hasn't visited here in years.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.678
It's been too painful for him.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.719
Until now.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.712
This was my bedroom.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.437
Welcome home, Masha.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.871
I promised you the truth.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.312
But there was a fire.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.796
I shot my father, I remember.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.957
What's the memory of a small child?

31:44.160 --> 31:47.995
You didn't remember me,
or your mother or this room.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.231
Reddington lied to you, Masha.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.080
He told you your father was dead,
but thanks to you...

31:53.240 --> 31:56.836
...what you did on the water,
I'm very much alive.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.752
The stories Reddington's told you...

31:59.920 --> 32:03.311
...about who he is
and his connection to you...

32:03.520 --> 32:06.035
...he knew you wanted answers
and took advantage...

32:06.200 --> 32:07.793
...of that to re-enter your life.

32:07.960 --> 32:12.034
But the answers you've been
looking for are here.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.190
Reddington, he was
in love with your mother.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.916
And he's obsessed with you.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.792
But it can't be true.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.551
But you know it is.

32:27.240 --> 32:31.393
I'm sorry, I've said too much.
You must be feeling overwhelmed.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.560
I'll go and check on
your daughter's arrival.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.670
Do you know why I call this cottage
the Summer Palace?

32:42.560 --> 32:44.472
We came here for a vacation one July...

32:44.680 --> 32:48.037
...and my little princess loved it.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.750
It's been a palace ever since.

34:12.760 --> 34:16.117
There you are.
Did you bring some treasures?

34:16.679 --> 34:19.275
Oh, these are beautiful.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.716
This is a time machine.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.077
One day you will come back here...

34:29.120 --> 34:31.351
...open it, and remember me.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.239
Yes, Mommy.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.479
Spread out. Let's go.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.270
Return fire!

35:54.760 --> 35:55.876
No.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.317
- Hands in the air! In the air!
- Stand down!

36:04.480 --> 36:06.119
Stand down. She's one of ours.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.516
Secure the house. Find Kirk.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.792
Find that child.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.233
Start low. I got high.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.876
<i>He's gone.
And if Agnes is with him, she's gone too.</i>

36:43.960 --> 36:46.520
He's waiting for you inside.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.719
- Where are we?
- Home. You're home.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.757
Let's go.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.154
What is this place?

37:34.640 --> 37:36.677
We're gonna find her.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.717
Stay with the car.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.314
There are places back here...

38:51.480 --> 38:54.632
...that have never borne
a human footprint.

38:55.760 --> 39:01.040
Fifty-three thousand acres
of virgin wilderness...

39:01.840 --> 39:05.720
...all but one owned by
the Bureau of Land Management.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.552
One acre.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.552
A jewel.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.800
A single buildable acre...

39:15.360 --> 39:19.320
...like a flawless diamond
set in a sea of emerald.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.913
The real estate equivalent
of a unicorn.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.353
I acquired it some years ago...

39:29.520 --> 39:34.311
...from a family who had held it
in trust for over a century and a half.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.394
Beautiful.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.073
Yes.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.798
You understand, Kate, that I...

39:54.960 --> 39:57.191
Have no choice?

39:58.200 --> 40:00.192
Isn't that the speech, Raymond?

40:00.360 --> 40:01.476
That I know too much.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.351
Every single one
of your weaknesses...

40:06.520 --> 40:08.034
...all your faults...

40:09.000 --> 40:10.992
...all your secrets.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.630
I dedicated my life to you.

40:14.800 --> 40:18.237
You entrusted me
with everything you value.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.392
Your freedom. Your life.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.038
A child.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.989
I have never failed you.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.638
What you see as a betrayal of trust...

40:28.800 --> 40:31.440
...was actually a fulfillment
of your wishes.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.319
To protect your interests.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.756
No more, no less.

40:37.720 --> 40:42.078
You presumed to decide
what was best for me.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.273
Even if I resolve the anger...

40:46.440 --> 40:48.716
...the pain you caused...

40:48.920 --> 40:51.310
...I can't trust you.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.753
Ever.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.998
I'm standing before a stranger.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.153
And yet I know you believe what
you did was best for Elizabeth...

41:07.360 --> 41:09.158
...which is why I brought you here.

41:10.320 --> 41:14.394
You've told me you've always
wanted a pristine, unspoiled place...

41:14.560 --> 41:17.200
...to live out your days in peace.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.750
So the acre is yours.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.400
For all eternity.
