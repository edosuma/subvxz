02:26.500 --> 02:27.620
Where are they?

02:31.100 --> 02:34.140
They're probably just running late.
They'll be here.

02:37.381 --> 02:38.700
I see them!

02:40.780 --> 02:41.742
Daddy!

02:46.862 --> 02:48.502
How are you, sweetie?

02:48.701 --> 02:50.101
Good to see you.

02:52.142 --> 02:53.421
Hi.
Hi.

02:53.662 --> 02:55.222
Hi there.
How are you?

02:58.342 --> 03:00.222
He's cute. Great!
Thanks.

03:01.541 --> 03:02.340
We got to go.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.340
We should go.
I have my number.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.980
I won't be in Chicago for a few days.
I'm going to the Cape....

03:10.260 --> 03:13.060
Same B & B as last year?
I have the number.

03:14.221 --> 03:15.421
Say bye to your mom.

03:15.661 --> 03:16.981
Give me a kiss.
Bye, Mom.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.660
I love you.

03:21.621 --> 03:23.661
Call me. Anytime.

03:23.941 --> 03:25.581
- Bye.
- Love you.

03:25.941 --> 03:27.342
Bye.
Bye.

03:35.502 --> 03:36.782
Bye, Mom.

04:15.102 --> 04:17.062
Sorry to be so late, ladies.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.622
Financial consultant.
Recently divorced.

04:28.103 --> 04:30.623
Did you notice the way
he ate his pancakes?

04:31.023 --> 04:32.983
He took his time on every bite.

04:34.142 --> 04:35.183
Get a grip.

04:35.462 --> 04:39.343
You know what they say about
tall, lanky men, don't you?

04:39.622 --> 04:40.944
They have enormous feet.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.144
Morning.

04:43.463 --> 04:46.983
I happen to know he's going
to the theater today, a matinee.

04:47.462 --> 04:49.344
I think I'll take the harbor tour.

06:08.905 --> 06:10.226
"Dear Catherine:

06:10.506 --> 06:13.226
I'm sorry I haven't talked to you
in so long.

06:13.585 --> 06:15.626
I feel I've been lost...

06:15.866 --> 06:18.466
...no bearings, no compass.

06:18.706 --> 06:22.586
I kept crashing into things, a little
crazy, I guess.

06:23.865 --> 06:26.505
I've never been lost before.

06:26.826 --> 06:28.867
You were my true north.

06:30.146 --> 06:33.587
I could always steer for home
when you were my home.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.424
Forgive me for being so angry
when you left.

06:37.705 --> 06:40.265
I still think
some mistake's been made...

06:40.505 --> 06:43.145
...and I'm waiting for God
to take it back.

06:46.666 --> 06:48.545
But I'm doing better now.

06:48.785 --> 06:50.585
The work helps me.

06:51.666 --> 06:54.306
Most of all, you help me.

06:55.625 --> 06:58.507
You came into my dream last night
with that smile...

06:58.746 --> 07:01.026
...that always held me
like a lover...

07:01.266 --> 07:03.306
...rocked me like a child.

07:05.267 --> 07:07.227
All I remember from the dream...

07:07.506 --> 07:09.226
...is a feeling of peace.

07:15.066 --> 07:16.708
I woke up with that feeling...

07:16.947 --> 07:19.907
...and tried to keep it alive
as long as I could.

07:20.626 --> 07:24.387
I'm writing to tell you that
I'm on a journey toward that peace.

07:25.107 --> 07:28.548
And to tell you I'm sorry
about so many things.

07:30.387 --> 07:33.348
I'm sorry I didn't take
better care of you...

07:33.587 --> 07:37.627
...so you never spent a minute
being cold or scared or sick."

07:43.188 --> 07:45.629
"I'm sorry I didn't
try harder to find the words...

07:45.908 --> 07:47.546
...to tell you what I was feeling.

07:47.827 --> 07:49.947
I'm sorry I never fixed
the screen door.

07:50.227 --> 07:51.427
I fixed it now.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.467
I'm sorry I ever fought with you.

07:56.027 --> 07:58.306
I'm sorry I didn't apologize more.

07:58.547 --> 07:59.947
I was too proud.

08:00.187 --> 08:02.547
I'm sorry I didn't
bring you more compliments...

08:02.787 --> 08:05.908
...on everything you wore and
every way you fixed your hair.

08:06.226 --> 08:08.667
I'm sorry I didn't hold on to you
with so much strength...

08:08.907 --> 08:11.108
...that even God
couldn't pull you away."

08:11.347 --> 08:13.228
Signed, "All my love, G."

08:15.228 --> 08:16.708
That is so sad.

08:17.308 --> 08:19.108
It's not that. It's just...

08:19.869 --> 08:20.668
...so honest.

08:21.468 --> 08:24.348
This could be hundreds of years old.

08:24.589 --> 08:26.388
It's typed, Alva.

08:31.349 --> 08:32.308
Pretty good.

08:32.587 --> 08:34.227
Meaning you wish you'd written it.

08:34.509 --> 08:36.389
I'd have e-mailed her.

08:36.748 --> 08:38.549
Anyway, I know what you wish.

08:38.828 --> 08:41.109
You wish it had been addressed
"Dear Theresa."

08:42.188 --> 08:44.149
Come on now, Charlie...

08:44.430 --> 08:47.069
...any girl would want
to be loved like that.

08:47.349 --> 08:49.550
To be somebody's "true north"?

08:49.789 --> 08:51.191
Are you kidding?

08:53.110 --> 08:54.750
Lonely women, particularly?

08:55.030 --> 08:56.430
Is that how you see me?

08:56.670 --> 08:59.388
Did you talk to anybody on your trip?
Tell any jokes?

09:00.428 --> 09:01.469
I had a good time.

09:01.747 --> 09:02.788
Really?

09:03.028 --> 09:03.988
Came back a day early.

09:05.388 --> 09:07.109
I happen to like my job.

09:07.789 --> 09:10.349
You're in denial.
You should be writing.

09:11.029 --> 09:12.990
You better hope I stick to research.

09:13.269 --> 09:14.828
I don't think you could
do your column without me.

09:15.189 --> 09:19.550
Ever notice that most people here refer
to me as Mr. Toschi, out of respect?

09:19.828 --> 09:22.109
I knew you before
your teeth were capped.

09:23.030 --> 09:26.389
I knew you when your step was swift
and your heart was high.

09:26.669 --> 09:30.630
Al Giddons, "Lakefront Winter."
Harcourt-Brace, 1948.

09:31.669 --> 09:33.229
Thought I made that up.

09:55.831 --> 09:58.031
Hey, Jase! How are you?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.152
Hi, Lina.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.151
No, sorry.

10:02.390 --> 10:04.592
I just was expecting him to call.

10:05.712 --> 10:08.432
No, I'm not worried. I just miss him.

10:08.711 --> 10:10.189
I know.

10:12.230 --> 10:13.269
What?

10:14.829 --> 10:16.869
No, I just got it. Why?

10:20.270 --> 10:21.230
What?

10:27.230 --> 10:29.270
I can't believe he did this.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.070
I can't believe it!

10:31.390 --> 10:34.191
Why are you so annoyed?
It's wrong to print it.

10:34.470 --> 10:38.071
It's private.
It's somebody's intimate thoughts.

10:38.431 --> 10:39.991
It's not your letter!

10:40.271 --> 10:42.911
I know it's not my letter.
I found it.

10:43.191 --> 10:45.551
Is this personal?
Is that why you're pissed off?

10:46.031 --> 10:48.591
I'm not pissed off! I'm just...

10:49.511 --> 10:51.312
...a little pissed off.

11:12.553 --> 11:15.592
You had your chance
at the Christmas party.

11:16.552 --> 11:18.593
Morning, doll.
Theresa?

11:20.233 --> 11:21.191
Look at this.

11:22.230 --> 11:25.112
Letters to the paper about
the message in the bottle.

11:25.391 --> 11:26.192
What?

11:26.471 --> 11:28.752
And two more boxes.
Take those to research.

11:28.991 --> 11:31.352
I found him in the mailroom.
Nice ass.

11:31.632 --> 11:33.591
Charlie wants us to drop everything.

11:33.872 --> 11:35.512
And do what?
Answer all of them?

11:35.792 --> 11:38.073
Go through them and
count the pros and cons.

11:38.351 --> 11:39.672
Get rid of the nutso letters.

11:39.952 --> 11:43.472
Then we'll do excerpts. The paper
wants us to milk it. This is big.

11:43.712 --> 11:45.513
Bigger than
the low-fat muffin scandal.

11:45.752 --> 11:47.712
Bigger than
the mayor and the teacher.

11:47.953 --> 11:49.272
It's amazing.

11:50.113 --> 11:51.912
"Your column sucks the big one."

11:52.352 --> 11:53.473
Negative, I think.
Listen.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.073
"If only more men would have
the sensitivity...

11:56.314 --> 11:58.753
...to talk about how they feel,
instead of...

11:59.033 --> 12:00.994
...hiding behind
the Sports Channel..."

12:01.273 --> 12:03.394
"My niece sent it to me.

12:03.634 --> 12:05.674
It might be from the same person.

12:05.913 --> 12:07.873
So I'm enclosing it here."

12:09.993 --> 12:10.794
What?

12:12.313 --> 12:13.434
What?

12:14.515 --> 12:15.474
"Dear Catherine."

12:15.913 --> 12:18.273
No. Are you kidding? Really?

12:18.555 --> 12:20.515
Out loud. Read it out loud.

12:23.355 --> 12:26.875
"Dear Catherine:
There isn't an hour without you in it.

12:27.154 --> 12:29.035
I mend the boats, test them...

12:29.314 --> 12:32.433
...and all the while
the memories come in like the tide.

12:33.673 --> 12:35.633
I thought today
of when we were young...

12:35.913 --> 12:38.553
...and you left our world
for a bigger world.

12:38.834 --> 12:41.713
I was a lot more scared
than I would admit.

12:42.153 --> 12:43.633
I fought my fear...

12:43.913 --> 12:46.553
...by telling myself
you'd come back someday...

12:46.794 --> 12:50.553
...and trying to think of the first
thing I'd say when I saw you again.

12:50.835 --> 12:53.874
I must have tried out
100 possibilities.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.354
What did I finally say?

12:56.634 --> 12:57.754
Not much.

12:58.035 --> 13:01.154
My mouth wouldn't work,
except to kiss you.

13:02.195 --> 13:04.234
When you said, 'I'm here to stay'...

13:04.474 --> 13:06.115
...that said it all.

13:07.034 --> 13:08.594
Well, I'm doing it again.

13:10.994 --> 13:14.274
I keep imagining what I'd say to you
if somehow you came back."

13:15.755 --> 13:18.275
Bob. It's Theresa at the Tribune.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.515
I know, it's been a while.

13:20.755 --> 13:22.315
I've got something for you.

13:22.595 --> 13:23.715
It's two traces.

13:23.996 --> 13:26.714
A sheet of stationery
has an imprint on it.

13:26.995 --> 13:29.356
Also,
where do I go for a typewriter trace?

13:29.676 --> 13:31.236
The typewriter you're looking for...

13:31.475 --> 13:33.917
...is an Olympic Herzfogen 980.

13:34.196 --> 13:35.755
German. And old.

13:35.997 --> 13:38.636
Would it have been sold commercially...

13:38.876 --> 13:40.516
...in the last 30 years?

13:40.755 --> 13:42.316
Well, it's been re-keyed.

13:42.557 --> 13:45.755
People who like manuals
buy these reconditioned.

13:46.035 --> 13:49.235
This letter was probably typed
within the last 5 years.

13:49.475 --> 13:50.875
So he's out there.

13:51.155 --> 13:52.715
And he could be young.

13:53.274 --> 13:54.075
You'll like this.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.716
Remember the report I did?
Cork came back.

13:56.995 --> 13:59.954
It's been in the water
approximately two years.

14:00.195 --> 14:01.675
That's it? Two years?

14:01.915 --> 14:03.315
Thank you.

14:04.555 --> 14:05.516
Don't look at me.

14:05.796 --> 14:06.996
Aqua glass.

14:07.235 --> 14:08.196
89...

14:08.516 --> 14:10.315
...looks like an "A."

14:10.875 --> 14:12.355
I'm sending you Polaroids.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.437
That sounds great.

14:25.276 --> 14:27.717
You like the baby, then?
Theresa?

14:28.357 --> 14:29.677
Theresa!
You're always so busy.

14:29.957 --> 14:32.236
I never get a chance to talk to you.

14:32.757 --> 14:34.236
Hang up!
Hang on one second.

14:35.118 --> 14:38.957
Remember the message
on the restaurant wall in Virginia?

14:39.197 --> 14:41.317
The stationery, the logo,
and the typewriter are there.

14:41.597 --> 14:44.318
Hit line five.
She's waiting for you.

14:44.596 --> 14:47.038
I never get to talk to him.
Call him back.

14:47.438 --> 14:48.397
Can she fax it?

14:48.677 --> 14:51.278
Fax it? It's Virginia.
Ellie's House of Crabs.

14:51.518 --> 14:53.158
How do I know if
she has a fax machine?

14:53.438 --> 14:54.638
Have her fax it.

14:55.317 --> 14:56.437
Fine.

14:57.876 --> 15:00.516
Right. Tell me about Bunker Hill.

15:07.117 --> 15:09.157
"To all the ships at sea
and all the ports of call.

15:09.436 --> 15:12.797
To my family and to all
friends and strangers."

15:13.037 --> 15:14.917
No "Dear Catherine"?
Not this time.

15:15.157 --> 15:17.197
The stationery
and typewriter check out.

15:17.438 --> 15:21.117
We think maybe this is
the first one or the final one.

15:21.917 --> 15:24.197
"This is a message and a prayer.

15:24.438 --> 15:27.317
The message is that my travels
taught me a great truth.

15:27.558 --> 15:30.277
I already had what
everyone is searching for...

15:30.558 --> 15:32.198
...and few ever find:

15:32.438 --> 15:35.478
The one person in the world
who I was born to love forever.

15:35.758 --> 15:37.798
A person like me, of the Outer Banks...

15:38.078 --> 15:39.557
...and the blue Atlantic mystery."

15:39.799 --> 15:41.439
Outer Banks.
That's North Carolina.

15:41.798 --> 15:44.599
Right. But it's about a dozen towns.

15:44.838 --> 15:48.038
Only four support a boat-building
and restoring company.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.199
Then we got him.

15:49.438 --> 15:52.319
We've got stringers there,
and a sister paper in Wilmington.

15:52.599 --> 15:55.199
I bet we find this guy
before the week's out.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.319
Any bets, girls?

16:00.760 --> 16:01.640
What?

16:01.879 --> 16:02.679
I want to go.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.199
She wants to do it.

16:04.599 --> 16:06.157
You find this guy, then what?

16:06.438 --> 16:08.797
I don't know. I'm not sure.
But I want to go.

16:09.117 --> 16:11.478
Can't spare you. Need you here.

16:12.918 --> 16:17.118
You're the one that sent me to India
for the column on smokestacks.

16:17.397 --> 16:20.518
You sent her to Texas for 3 days,
talking to Marines.

16:20.758 --> 16:22.039
That was different.

16:22.278 --> 16:24.158
Why do you have to
do this personally?

16:24.439 --> 16:26.478
What do you mean?
I'm intrigued, so what?

16:26.720 --> 16:27.519
Intrigued?

16:27.799 --> 16:29.518
What if he's covered in tattoos...

16:29.799 --> 16:31.759
...and has four serious convictions?

16:32.319 --> 16:33.279
Tell her.

16:35.318 --> 16:36.718
I'm only afraid that...

16:36.960 --> 16:38.999
...your expectations are too high.

16:39.238 --> 16:41.359
I don't have any. This is research.

16:41.879 --> 16:45.320
You're thinking Heathcliff.
You're thinking Hamlet.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.800
This guy is probably Captain Ahab.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.400
Are you saying that I can't go?

16:53.600 --> 16:55.560
It's called a risk, Charlie, right?

16:55.799 --> 16:58.160
Something you've been
telling me for two years.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.881
"Take a risk."

17:00.120 --> 17:01.520
Remember when you asked
me to call...

17:01.760 --> 17:04.400
...all the stationery stores
in the Outer Banks area?

17:04.640 --> 17:07.599
I've got other names for you.
I got it.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.839
What? You got what?

17:10.080 --> 17:11.560
I called one in Morehead City.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.121
They remembered
the little sailboat logo.

17:14.361 --> 17:17.719
They said it was designed
by the customers.

17:19.479 --> 17:20.439
It's them.

17:20.959 --> 17:21.999
Don't tell Charlie.

17:22.279 --> 17:24.398
He'll try and make you
do this over the phone.

17:24.680 --> 17:25.878
You got him, Theresa.

17:26.519 --> 17:28.400
Now go knock on his door.

18:52.883 --> 18:53.682
Ma'am?

18:56.722 --> 18:58.123
Can I help you?

19:00.162 --> 19:03.603
Sorry, I just admire these
older homes.

19:03.882 --> 19:05.282
You're in real estate?

19:07.082 --> 19:07.883
No.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.802
Could I take
a photograph of the house...

19:13.043 --> 19:13.922
...for a publication?

19:14.164 --> 19:15.483
Jehovah's Witness?

19:15.844 --> 19:16.962
No.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.643
Photograph.
Well, I never thought of that.

19:20.763 --> 19:22.323
Can't say yes or no.

19:22.642 --> 19:23.764
And why's that?

19:24.044 --> 19:25.323
That's my son's place.

19:26.724 --> 19:28.284
I live back down...

19:28.564 --> 19:29.523
...thataway.

19:29.884 --> 19:31.924
So you're going to have to ask him.

19:32.164 --> 19:35.204
He'll be kicking around the harbor.
Garret Blake.

19:36.204 --> 19:37.683
Never wears a hat.

19:38.404 --> 19:40.362
Great. Thank you.

19:41.402 --> 19:42.602
Is it Playboy?

19:44.402 --> 19:45.962
I always admired your covers.

19:46.363 --> 19:48.083
Never bought the magazine, though.

19:51.843 --> 19:53.644
Well, there's always tomorrow.

20:20.204 --> 20:21.004
Hi.

20:21.924 --> 20:23.404
Oh, hi.

20:23.645 --> 20:24.525
Great day, isn't it?

20:24.765 --> 20:26.885
It's a beauty.
Wish I was out on the water.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.446
Yeah, I bet.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.445
Great boat.
Are you restoring it?

20:33.724 --> 20:35.284
Yeah, doing the best I can.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.325
Do you restore boats for a living?

20:39.605 --> 20:41.805
No, I'm just a weekend warrior.

20:42.125 --> 20:44.406
You got a boat that
needs some work done?

20:44.645 --> 20:45.445
Actually...

20:45.686 --> 20:49.365
I got a man here in town.
He's got a shop. Garret!

20:50.246 --> 20:51.805
He's working on the schooner there.

20:52.044 --> 20:54.764
The 40-footer.
Sweet lines on that boat.

20:55.043 --> 20:56.844
You can't beat the old woodies.

20:57.084 --> 20:57.885
Great, thank you.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.244
- You bet. You have a nice day.
- You too.

21:24.045 --> 21:25.006
Hi.

21:26.406 --> 21:29.686
I love the older, the wooden boats.

21:30.126 --> 21:33.486
It must be a 40-footer?
A schooner, right?

21:33.766 --> 21:35.246
It's an Alden Schooner.

21:36.206 --> 21:38.487
1922, out of Maine.

21:41.527 --> 21:42.326
Is she yours?

21:44.167 --> 21:45.127
Nope.

21:45.447 --> 21:47.567
Just putting her back in shape.

21:49.126 --> 21:49.928
Sweet lines.

21:54.247 --> 21:55.727
You want to step aboard?

21:56.807 --> 21:57.688
Yeah.

21:58.927 --> 22:01.366
There's some wet spots.

22:12.805 --> 22:13.766
She's a beauty.

22:15.846 --> 22:17.166
Was she in bad shape?

22:17.847 --> 22:18.887
Neglected.

22:19.407 --> 22:20.206
Unappreciated.

22:21.686 --> 22:22.646
I know how she feels.

22:24.326 --> 22:25.127
Doubt it.

22:28.047 --> 22:28.847
You a tourist?

22:29.328 --> 22:32.126
I'm just getting acquainted
with the place, the people.

22:34.127 --> 22:35.327
I'm Theresa...

22:35.568 --> 22:36.447
...Osborne.

22:38.287 --> 22:39.168
Garret Blake.

22:39.807 --> 22:41.688
You sound like up north.

22:42.088 --> 22:43.407
- Do I?
- Yup.

22:44.087 --> 22:44.967
Chicago.

22:45.248 --> 22:46.287
I'm in research.

22:48.008 --> 22:48.968
On what?

22:50.688 --> 22:53.287
Just about everything.
For a newspaper.

22:54.688 --> 22:58.128
Is there anywhere I can do
some sailing while I'm here?

22:58.688 --> 23:00.648
You could rent
a boat on the other side.

23:00.889 --> 23:03.489
Oh, no, I mean,
I'm not experienced...

23:03.728 --> 23:04.528
...at all.

23:05.569 --> 23:07.448
I'd like to be. I just....

23:08.128 --> 23:10.488
I'm from the Prairie State, so....

23:12.730 --> 23:14.687
I'm a dodo in the water.

23:18.528 --> 23:21.407
Sorry to have interrupted your work.
Thank you.

23:25.288 --> 23:27.408
I'm taking her out tomorrow morning.

23:27.688 --> 23:30.328
Test sail.
Round the point and back.

23:30.848 --> 23:32.049
Just about an hour.

23:33.488 --> 23:34.808
Do you want to come along?

23:37.928 --> 23:38.968
That'd be nice.

23:39.249 --> 23:40.568
About seven.

23:40.809 --> 23:41.769
Great!

23:43.169 --> 23:44.809
If you come earlier...

23:45.049 --> 23:46.530
...I'll be in that diner over there.

23:46.808 --> 23:48.129
Earlier than seven?

23:49.609 --> 23:51.729
Great. I'll see you here.

23:52.770 --> 23:53.890
Or at the...

23:54.129 --> 23:55.008
...at the diner.

24:26.289 --> 24:27.329
Hi, Chet.
How you doing?

24:27.569 --> 24:29.289
Alrighty.
Jesus, Chet!

24:29.529 --> 24:33.650
You always have the same
people in here every day.

24:36.369 --> 24:38.729
All the tourists go
to the Pancake Palace.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.330
Let them!

24:42.171 --> 24:44.890
And what do you got?
The same fishermen.

24:45.290 --> 24:46.489
A would-be carpenter.

24:46.810 --> 24:49.450
And a nearsighted mechanic.

24:49.690 --> 24:52.130
And a thief who wants
to be a shipwright.

24:53.370 --> 24:55.250
Now don't start any shit, Johnny.

24:55.530 --> 24:59.211
A thief is somebody who keeps
property belongs to somebody else.

24:59.410 --> 25:00.211
Am I right?

25:00.450 --> 25:03.891
You ain't right if the courts
say you ain't right, right?

25:05.130 --> 25:06.331
Loudmouth asshole.

25:06.891 --> 25:07.851
What'd you say?

25:09.611 --> 25:11.891
How'd you know I was talking
to you, Johnny?

25:12.571 --> 25:14.771
I'm calling Pete right now.

25:15.011 --> 25:18.452
You two bust up this place again
and charges will be pressed...

25:18.732 --> 25:20.932
...arrests will be made,
and I ain't bluffing!

25:21.332 --> 25:24.292
Man who's a thief
deserves to be in jail.

25:25.252 --> 25:28.292
I never took a damn thing from you
or anybody in this town.

25:28.572 --> 25:31.292
I say different.
You're a liar, Johnny.

25:31.571 --> 25:32.852
Don't ever call me a liar!

25:33.091 --> 25:34.973
Come on, grab hold of him!

25:41.690 --> 25:43.251
Will you guys get ahold of them?

25:43.530 --> 25:44.650
Will you separate them?

25:47.050 --> 25:48.851
Garret, come here.
Now get off him.

25:49.650 --> 25:50.452
Get over here!

25:54.371 --> 25:55.411
Now leave it alone.

25:55.692 --> 25:57.332
Just walk away for once.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.051
He ain't worth it, Garret.

26:01.692 --> 26:02.492
Go on.

26:02.731 --> 26:04.532
Didn't you see what he...?

26:06.412 --> 26:07.451
Come on, easy.

26:07.693 --> 26:09.012
Settle down, John.
Go ahead, Garret.

26:09.292 --> 26:11.252
He ain't worth it.
Let me go!

26:11.812 --> 26:12.853
It's all over.

26:38.374 --> 26:39.853
Thought you wouldn't come.

26:40.734 --> 26:42.934
I came to say I'm not coming.

26:45.334 --> 26:48.212
I didn't want to not show,
because I hate people like that.

26:49.092 --> 26:50.732
I'm sorry you saw that.

26:51.532 --> 26:52.572
Does that happen a lot here?

26:52.853 --> 26:55.133
I mean, instead of bowling or....

27:00.572 --> 27:02.053
Maybe I'll see you around.

27:02.292 --> 27:04.573
I'm still going to
run her out for a test.

27:07.012 --> 27:08.413
Just a short sail.

27:08.933 --> 27:11.653
I don't know, you know.
What if you got mad at me?

27:12.173 --> 27:13.574
It's a small boat.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.333
I don't like fighting, Theresa.

27:17.734 --> 27:18.694
Bowling, either.

27:21.454 --> 27:23.014
Before you go, would you...

27:23.253 --> 27:25.294
...untie that, toss it in?

27:26.575 --> 27:27.535
Appreciate it.

27:40.055 --> 27:41.176
Thanks.

27:54.455 --> 27:55.576
Hi.

28:08.135 --> 28:09.454
Where am I not in your way?

28:10.334 --> 28:11.735
I'll get around you.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.414
Should I just jump over?

28:26.575 --> 28:27.975
I'm sorry, I...

28:29.135 --> 28:31.094
...I used to be better with people.

28:33.135 --> 28:34.695
So you used to be charming?

28:36.616 --> 28:38.095
Sorry I missed that.

29:03.137 --> 29:04.936
Who is that man in the diner?

29:06.617 --> 29:07.937
It's an old thing.

29:08.617 --> 29:10.494
I don't want to pry.

29:10.896 --> 29:12.175
How old?

29:16.375 --> 29:19.016
So this is what you do?
Research?

29:20.815 --> 29:23.096
No, actually,
it's called conversation.

29:25.336 --> 29:27.776
I might be able to help you.
I have a degree.

29:30.296 --> 29:32.657
So you stole his girlfriend
in the eighth grade?

29:34.375 --> 29:35.416
No.

29:36.697 --> 29:38.016
I married his sister.

29:41.417 --> 29:42.537
So, your turn.

29:42.817 --> 29:43.617
Right?

29:44.257 --> 29:45.376
Okay.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.058
Still married?

29:47.738 --> 29:48.617
No.

29:49.778 --> 29:50.577
You?

29:50.857 --> 29:51.657
No.

29:53.178 --> 29:54.217
I have a son.

29:55.217 --> 29:56.338
A great son.

29:57.937 --> 29:58.737
Date much?

29:59.538 --> 30:00.498
No.

30:01.458 --> 30:02.258
You?

30:04.299 --> 30:05.858
You're getting the hang of this.

30:06.259 --> 30:07.578
Watch your head with the boom.

30:49.459 --> 30:51.419
Did you hear from your mama?

30:53.338 --> 30:54.658
Got a letter.

30:56.058 --> 30:57.458
Still doesn't like you.

30:59.820 --> 31:01.299
No fooling.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.979
Looks a little small for you.

31:11.419 --> 31:12.460
What?

31:12.979 --> 31:13.859
The jacket.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.259
What jac...

31:17.980 --> 31:19.260
- It's hers.
- Whose?

31:20.259 --> 31:21.819
Woman from today.

31:22.259 --> 31:23.899
She left it on board.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.660
Well, did you tell her?
Did you call her?

31:28.060 --> 31:29.019
No.

31:29.261 --> 31:32.617
I thought maybe you'd drop it off
for me in town at the hotel.

31:34.019 --> 31:36.139
I'm not going to do it.
Take her the jacket.

31:38.418 --> 31:40.059
You don't want to see her again?

31:41.938 --> 31:42.739
Maybe.

31:43.019 --> 31:44.139
So?

31:45.859 --> 31:48.299
So, Dad, it's not an easy thing.

31:51.179 --> 31:52.660
You be her.

31:53.219 --> 31:54.180
I'll be you.

31:55.340 --> 31:56.660
Here's your jacket.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.179
Jackets like that...

32:02.580 --> 32:05.020
...don't come along
every week, you know.

32:16.141 --> 32:17.261
One second.

32:24.621 --> 32:25.421
Hi.

32:25.661 --> 32:26.462
You forgot this.

32:26.701 --> 32:27.982
Thank you.

32:28.661 --> 32:30.701
I stayed in.
I didn't even notice.

32:31.421 --> 32:32.461
Thanks.

32:34.461 --> 32:35.781
You want to come in?

32:37.061 --> 32:38.262
Yeah.

32:43.421 --> 32:44.699
Nice place.

32:46.061 --> 32:48.261
It's Victorian, 1911.

32:48.701 --> 32:51.059
Made into an inn in 1944.

32:51.780 --> 32:52.580
But...

32:52.900 --> 32:54.700
...you probably knew all that stuff.

32:56.380 --> 32:58.021
I've never been in here.

32:58.699 --> 32:59.501
Oh, well.

33:00.221 --> 33:02.581
Why would you be in here?
You're from here.

33:02.861 --> 33:04.661
This is your hometown.

33:08.341 --> 33:10.301
I had a really good time today.

33:12.261 --> 33:13.061
The boat did well.

33:13.582 --> 33:15.782
We didn't have to bail or anything.

33:21.821 --> 33:23.862
Thanks for bringing the jacket.

33:24.142 --> 33:25.462
You're welcome.

33:27.062 --> 33:29.341
I just said thank you
about eight times...

33:29.583 --> 33:32.302
...because I have no idea
what to say.

33:32.903 --> 33:36.662
I wonder why you're here, because
you don't know what to say either.

33:36.903 --> 33:38.104
I'm wondering that too.

33:46.783 --> 33:47.982
You eat meat?

33:50.024 --> 33:51.143
Eat red meat?

33:51.823 --> 33:53.223
Sometimes.

33:53.863 --> 33:56.222
I make a perfect steak.

33:57.502 --> 33:59.383
It's the best thing I do.

34:03.141 --> 34:04.622
- You're bragging.
- I know.

34:05.822 --> 34:07.222
But it's true.

34:08.222 --> 34:11.101
Well, that's very interesting.
Thanks for telling me.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.702
I'd like to make you one...

34:16.101 --> 34:17.222
...tomorrow night.

34:17.503 --> 34:18.621
You would?

34:23.263 --> 34:27.143
You know, on the boat today...

34:27.422 --> 34:29.223
...I had a good time too.

34:36.063 --> 34:37.342
What time?

34:38.824 --> 34:40.304
Six.

34:41.464 --> 34:43.503
It's 18 Foster Lane.

34:43.864 --> 34:44.824
I know.

34:45.904 --> 34:46.784
You do?

34:48.264 --> 34:49.585
I know...

34:49.824 --> 34:51.784
...it's got to be on the water.
Right?

34:52.902 --> 34:55.344
Right. Everything's on the water.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.145
- Night.
- See you.

35:22.023 --> 35:23.824
Hi.
Hi.

35:24.785 --> 35:25.824
You found it.

35:29.505 --> 35:30.624
Come in.

35:31.184 --> 35:33.144
I didn't know you were so close.

35:33.505 --> 35:34.825
You walked!

35:36.225 --> 35:37.345
I hope you like red.

35:37.825 --> 35:39.865
I do. I already have one opened.

35:42.864 --> 35:44.065
You need some help?

35:44.305 --> 35:45.105
No.

35:45.385 --> 35:46.344
Just...

35:46.586 --> 35:48.226
...make yourself welcome.

35:49.106 --> 35:51.826
- Can I pour you a glass?
- Yeah, please.

35:57.026 --> 35:58.506
What a great house!

36:00.066 --> 36:01.466
The light in here...

36:14.987 --> 36:17.187
I love this boat painting.

36:17.825 --> 36:19.866
It's incredible.
You can hear it, almost.

36:20.105 --> 36:21.225
The wind.

36:22.385 --> 36:24.265
Is it a local artist?

36:25.065 --> 36:26.626
It's my wife, Catherine.

36:28.105 --> 36:30.146
She died two years ago.

36:34.065 --> 36:35.386
I'm sorry.

37:05.507 --> 37:06.548
Do you paint also?

37:09.427 --> 37:10.628
No.

37:15.507 --> 37:18.228
My dad died when I was in college.

37:18.508 --> 37:21.467
I remember my mom kept
one of his shirts...

37:21.747 --> 37:24.708
...on the back of a chair
in my parents' bedroom.

37:25.028 --> 37:27.389
And she probably
left it there for....

37:29.665 --> 37:31.786
Maybe it's still there,
I don't know.

38:07.388 --> 38:09.508
Hey, Garret....

38:09.748 --> 38:12.029
Look, I was nervous...

38:12.268 --> 38:14.908
...so I drank too much wine.

38:15.269 --> 38:19.029
But listen, there's something
that I should tell you.

38:19.269 --> 38:21.069
I was nervous too.

38:23.709 --> 38:24.669
I just....

38:28.429 --> 38:29.470
What?

38:35.190 --> 38:36.230
I didn't....

38:38.389 --> 38:40.029
I don't do this.

38:40.347 --> 38:41.388
Thank God.

38:41.628 --> 38:43.187
I don't do this either.

38:43.428 --> 38:44.708
I'm not good at this.

38:49.749 --> 38:52.628
For two people that don't do it,
we do it pretty well.

38:58.949 --> 39:01.469
Does it feel cold enough for a fire?

39:08.349 --> 39:10.709
I thought we were still in love.

39:12.030 --> 39:14.230
But maybe I didn't even
think about it...

39:14.510 --> 39:18.189
...because I had my son,
my work, my husband.

39:18.830 --> 39:21.190
I was on my way to becoming a writer.

39:21.550 --> 39:23.189
And David and I...

39:23.471 --> 39:26.590
...were even talking about
having a second child.

39:27.550 --> 39:29.190
Can you believe that?

39:31.030 --> 39:32.991
Then one day I was just
driving along...

39:35.471 --> 39:36.670
...and I saw them.

39:38.551 --> 39:40.351
David and this woman...

39:41.870 --> 39:43.510
...walking into the park.

39:46.751 --> 39:49.711
And it was just a glimpse.
It was a second.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.429
And I knew.

39:53.710 --> 39:57.469
I sat there in my car. I didn't
shut off the engine. I just sat...

39:57.710 --> 39:59.351
...for an hour and a half.

40:02.310 --> 40:04.270
You're faced with the impossible...

40:04.550 --> 40:06.270
...and it takes an hour and a half.

40:14.831 --> 40:16.951
It was going on almost a year.

40:24.950 --> 40:27.392
I can't believe I just
told you all that.

40:28.832 --> 40:32.032
I mean, this stuff
happens to everybody, right?

40:34.472 --> 40:36.753
But it happened to you, Theresa.

40:40.353 --> 40:41.752
And I'm sorry.

40:46.872 --> 40:49.753
That kind of stuff
happen in St. Claire?

40:50.793 --> 40:53.353
Everything happens in St. Claire...

40:54.833 --> 40:56.032
...eventually.

41:03.631 --> 41:06.510
Tell me about Catherine.

41:11.191 --> 41:12.231
Well...

41:14.552 --> 41:16.431
...we grew up together.

41:16.792 --> 41:18.592
She was kind of....

41:23.392 --> 41:26.752
People were drawn to her
by her smile...

41:27.192 --> 41:28.473
...her enthusiasm.

41:31.793 --> 41:34.593
She could brighten up
a whole room...

41:34.873 --> 41:36.273
...whole town.

41:40.233 --> 41:42.753
I called her Saint Catherine.

41:47.874 --> 41:49.194
How did she die?

41:53.593 --> 41:54.793
She was ill.

41:57.313 --> 41:58.594
She was fragile.

42:00.073 --> 42:01.034
I'm sorry.

42:05.235 --> 42:06.114
It's all right.

42:06.475 --> 42:07.274
It's okay.

42:09.155 --> 42:10.635
Have you lived here
your whole life?

42:10.874 --> 42:11.753
Not yet.

42:14.793 --> 42:15.913
This place...

42:17.072 --> 42:19.353
...used to be all dirt roads
and marsh grass.

42:19.592 --> 42:20.473
Really?

42:21.112 --> 42:22.433
My mom hated it here.

42:22.673 --> 42:25.553
She took me away to Virginia
when I was ten.

42:25.833 --> 42:27.794
But I came back when I was 16...

42:29.473 --> 42:30.874
...and never left.

42:31.514 --> 42:33.794
I missed it.
I missed the smell of it...

42:34.073 --> 42:35.713
...working on the water...

42:36.554 --> 42:37.874
...missed my dad.

42:40.394 --> 42:41.434
The quiet.

42:43.634 --> 42:44.914
The wind.

42:45.474 --> 42:47.515
The wind?
You call that wind?

42:47.954 --> 42:48.995
The wind...

42:49.515 --> 42:51.554
...in Chicago in the wintertime...

42:52.635 --> 42:55.594
...you walk with your back to it
or it cuts your face.

42:55.874 --> 42:56.836
Takes your breath away.

43:01.195 --> 43:03.155
We got the oldest oak tree...

43:03.435 --> 43:04.754
...in both Carolinas.

43:05.436 --> 43:07.715
You try and top that.

44:12.716 --> 44:14.598
I just want to be close.

44:48.197 --> 44:49.516
Watch the dust.

44:53.716 --> 44:55.356
She took a look at my plans...

44:55.597 --> 44:57.316
...and never said a word.

44:58.437 --> 45:01.077
A week later she had it on canvas.

45:01.677 --> 45:03.877
This was going to be the first.

45:06.318 --> 45:08.757
Designing and building
my own boats...

45:09.557 --> 45:10.957
...that was the plan.

45:12.678 --> 45:14.957
This was going to be
my signature boat...

45:15.198 --> 45:16.757
...the one we'd never sell.

45:18.998 --> 45:20.558
And when will you finish it?

45:24.758 --> 45:27.118
I haven't touched it in two years.

45:28.918 --> 45:30.038
Someday.

45:30.478 --> 45:31.439
Right.

45:32.719 --> 45:33.679
Someday.

45:35.479 --> 45:37.200
And you'll take me out
on that boat?

45:37.478 --> 45:40.599
Around the point, where the wind
will scare me to death?

45:45.240 --> 45:46.959
There'll be no wind tonight.

45:49.518 --> 45:50.798
And you know that?

45:53.077 --> 45:54.877
I'm the son of a fisherman.

45:55.279 --> 45:56.997
You watch the Weather Channel.

45:58.198 --> 46:00.157
Will you sail with me tonight?

46:05.038 --> 46:06.838
I go back in a few days.

46:07.799 --> 46:10.999
And I can't change that,
because my son's coming home.

46:11.598 --> 46:14.799
I don't know if this makes sense.
Maybe...

46:21.119 --> 46:22.159
Okay.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.159
Well, that's a mistake...

46:29.719 --> 46:31.759
...letting her taste your coffee.

46:32.161 --> 46:33.879
Well, she liked it last night.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.880
She was just being polite.

46:36.520 --> 46:38.801
Nobody likes it, take my word.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.321
Be good.

46:43.679 --> 46:44.641
Oh, Lord.

46:45.161 --> 46:46.041
Now what?

46:50.841 --> 46:51.881
Go easy.

47:00.159 --> 47:01.358
Hold it right there.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.479
You stay out of our way!

47:02.720 --> 47:04.039
You're not welcome here, Johnny.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.599
You better stay out of our way!
Both of you!

47:05.880 --> 47:07.519
Guess the courts
turned you down again?

47:07.840 --> 47:09.560
It's not your business.
It's settled.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.760
No, we just want the paintings.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.359
They were part of our life here, Marta.

47:13.640 --> 47:15.760
The only one who sees them is you.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.680
People should see them.

47:18.440 --> 47:19.560
Please, Garret.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.840
It's all you left us of her.

47:23.400 --> 47:26.120
That's the first time you
called me her killer, Hank...

47:26.361 --> 47:27.320
...at least to my face.

47:27.561 --> 47:28.840
Nobody killed her.

47:29.081 --> 47:31.880
He left her alone when
she was sick and weak.

47:32.161 --> 47:34.361
- She wanted to come home to us!
- This was her home!

47:34.640 --> 47:35.761
Now he's killing her mother.

47:36.002 --> 47:37.961
I hear her heart break
every goddamn day.

47:38.201 --> 47:39.681
I gave you everything of hers.

47:39.921 --> 47:41.881
The paintings!
You got yourself another woman.

47:42.161 --> 47:44.761
What the hell do you care?
You son of a bitch.

47:45.001 --> 47:46.401
Just stay out of this.

47:46.641 --> 47:47.762
Step aside!

47:51.641 --> 47:52.681
She painted them here.

47:53.202 --> 47:54.241
She hung them here.

47:55.042 --> 47:57.841
She was the last to touch them!
That's how it'll stay!

47:58.082 --> 47:59.802
All right! All right.

48:00.082 --> 48:02.122
This is what you want, isn't it?

48:02.642 --> 48:04.602
If I cut it up
you can all have a piece.

48:04.842 --> 48:06.042
You can all have a piece of her!

48:06.602 --> 48:07.882
Just set it down, Dad.

48:08.123 --> 48:09.840
Step aside!

48:12.722 --> 48:14.000
My God...

48:14.881 --> 48:17.001
...is this what she is to you?

48:19.042 --> 48:22.002
Something to fight over, pull apart?
Look at you.

48:22.442 --> 48:24.642
All three of you
have blood in your eyes.

48:25.042 --> 48:26.242
Is that for Catherine?

48:26.722 --> 48:30.762
Or is that so you can walk around and
beat your chest like a bunch of apes?

48:31.002 --> 48:32.402
Goddamn it, you're outside of this.

48:32.682 --> 48:34.161
Well, I loved her too.

48:34.482 --> 48:36.602
And I want something
to remember her by.

48:36.842 --> 48:38.402
Piece of this will do.

48:44.363 --> 48:45.483
She'd hate this!

48:45.883 --> 48:47.003
She'd hate it, Hank.

48:47.282 --> 48:48.604
Dodge is right.
She'd hate this...

48:48.882 --> 48:50.282
...worse than dying!

49:10.244 --> 49:11.364
Crazy people.

49:13.284 --> 49:15.404
They're only half the war.

49:17.364 --> 49:20.004
You saw them.
You heard what they said.

49:21.482 --> 49:24.082
But you carry your half around
pretty good too.

51:48.566 --> 51:50.366
Are you okay with this?

51:58.206 --> 51:59.486
Until you...

52:04.407 --> 52:08.247
...I didn't even think about
being close to anybody else.

52:09.167 --> 52:10.486
Sometimes...

52:17.367 --> 52:19.168
...I still feel her. She's...

52:19.967 --> 52:21.087
...here.

52:22.567 --> 52:24.928
And I don't want to
cheat you, Theresa.

53:23.849 --> 53:25.649
You're going to eat
that whole bag?

53:25.888 --> 53:27.689
Why do you have
two bags of marshmallows?

53:28.089 --> 53:29.209
Ammo.

54:07.968 --> 54:09.288
Wait.

54:12.089 --> 54:13.810
It's so great here.

54:33.450 --> 54:34.570
Hi.

54:37.850 --> 54:39.050
It was so nice outside.

54:39.290 --> 54:42.251
I decided to set the table out there.
Is that okay?

54:44.130 --> 54:46.331
You said to come in, right?

54:47.330 --> 54:48.371
I know.

54:49.611 --> 54:51.971
We can eat
in the kitchen if you want.

54:52.211 --> 54:56.411
And I got angel food cake,
so I hope your dad likes cake.

55:04.572 --> 55:06.372
I was going to put that back.

55:10.092 --> 55:13.211
Look, I just didn't know
where the boundaries were.

55:19.131 --> 55:21.570
I didn't know where
the boundaries were either.

55:22.530 --> 55:24.570
Let me get this
out of the way. I'm sorry.

55:24.851 --> 55:25.730
I really...

55:28.571 --> 55:29.370
Let me get it.

55:29.651 --> 55:31.132
Let me clean it up, okay?

55:33.331 --> 55:35.131
- I'll get a rag. I can do it.
- I'll get it.

55:35.371 --> 55:36.412
I said, I'll get it!

55:40.331 --> 55:42.291
Just give me a minute.

56:03.533 --> 56:04.812
So you're the jacket.

56:06.413 --> 56:07.454
Yeah, that's me.

56:07.693 --> 56:10.213
You were looking around here
a couple days ago.

56:10.453 --> 56:11.733
Find what you wanted?

56:13.093 --> 56:14.133
I don't know.

56:15.372 --> 56:16.854
I'm Theresa.

56:18.814 --> 56:19.934
Dodge.

56:20.853 --> 56:22.053
Like the pickup.

56:23.054 --> 56:25.774
He said you were pretty.
He should've said beautiful.

56:26.413 --> 56:28.134
Why didn't he inherit that charm?

56:29.212 --> 56:31.572
You had a fight.
That's a good sign.

56:32.372 --> 56:33.572
I made a mistake.

56:35.533 --> 56:38.052
I moved something
out of its place.

56:40.332 --> 56:42.293
Don't pay that any mind.

56:42.733 --> 56:43.932
He's still not right about it.

56:44.253 --> 56:47.053
It's like a truck hit him.
Swear to God.

56:50.732 --> 56:54.413
Clams, better here than anywhere.
Come on inside.

56:55.493 --> 56:57.133
It's pretty crowded in there.

56:59.533 --> 57:01.013
You want to take a walk?

57:06.773 --> 57:08.095
He won't tell you much.

57:08.334 --> 57:10.855
The man talks
about as much as a fish.

57:11.414 --> 57:12.453
Anyway...

57:12.694 --> 57:15.254
...wasn't good
right from the beginning.

57:16.015 --> 57:18.534
Her family thought
that she would be the one...

57:18.774 --> 57:21.894
...to bust out of here
and just shake the world.

57:22.175 --> 57:24.055
Garret was too much like them.

57:24.295 --> 57:27.255
They thought, anyway,
that he would be...

57:28.735 --> 57:31.535
...an anchor around her,
keep her life small.

57:33.215 --> 57:34.254
How did she die?

57:36.495 --> 57:39.535
Pregnancy just took
the stuffing right out of her.

57:41.414 --> 57:44.293
Keeled over at her parents' house
and they kept her there.

57:44.535 --> 57:48.135
So Garret went over
and kicked the door down.

57:48.414 --> 57:49.973
Carried her out.

57:50.334 --> 57:51.735
She was glad too.

57:53.295 --> 57:56.734
He took care of her
the best he could...

57:57.774 --> 58:00.055
...for about a month, I guess.
And then....

58:01.055 --> 58:02.535
Well, she just...

58:02.774 --> 58:04.055
...gave out.

58:11.295 --> 58:14.096
Now you know why Garret
don't talk much.

58:15.416 --> 58:17.535
Because his old man never shuts up.

58:17.776 --> 58:19.415
Can we eat now?

58:26.295 --> 58:28.176
You ought to
knock down some walls.

58:28.416 --> 58:30.137
It's getting too crowded in there.

58:30.697 --> 58:31.975
Can't afford it.

58:32.217 --> 58:33.777
Do the work ourselves.

58:34.016 --> 58:36.137
Just end up looking like a boat.

58:36.417 --> 58:37.616
Add a deck.

58:37.856 --> 58:38.977
A couple of rooms.

58:39.256 --> 58:42.138
Why? You thinking about moving in?

58:45.697 --> 58:48.497
Not in a million years.
You'd like that though, wouldn't you?

58:48.777 --> 58:49.817
Keep your eye on me.

58:50.097 --> 58:52.295
He's afraid I'm going to
go back to my old habit.

58:52.574 --> 58:53.855
Anybody want any cake?

58:54.095 --> 58:55.415
I used to drink like a fish.

58:55.655 --> 58:57.855
It ruined my health.
It's no deep, dark secret.

58:58.135 --> 59:00.855
Well, it's no citizen award
either.

59:01.136 --> 59:03.096
Two beers a day, that's my limit.

59:03.336 --> 59:04.976
Change the subject?

59:06.496 --> 59:07.536
Yes.

59:10.456 --> 59:13.096
The subject is change.
People change.

59:13.336 --> 59:16.136
Even you.
That is the subject.

59:16.936 --> 59:18.336
Good dinner.

59:22.017 --> 59:23.578
You were the best thing about it.

59:23.817 --> 59:27.936
If I was about 150 years younger,
you'd be in trouble, young lady.

59:30.017 --> 59:31.218
Where you going?

59:32.577 --> 59:34.777
Taking my dessert on the beach.

59:35.017 --> 59:36.137
Thanks.

59:42.657 --> 59:44.138
He likes me.

59:45.697 --> 59:46.577
Well, he's a...

59:46.939 --> 59:48.258
...good man.

59:50.618 --> 59:52.898
He said you were a pain in the ass.

59:57.098 --> 59:58.658
Kidding. That was me.

01:00:00.899 --> 01:00:02.298
Well, he's right.

01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:06.777
You are the best thing
about this dinner.

01:00:07.777 --> 01:00:09.817
And this day...

01:00:11.777 --> 01:00:13.898
...and this year.

01:00:18.377 --> 01:00:20.178
I wish it was simpler.

01:00:21.857 --> 01:00:23.498
I wish it was easier.

01:00:26.577 --> 01:00:28.058
And I'm sorry.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.257
Well, I'm not expecting flowers, but...

01:01:15.499 --> 01:01:17.059
...will we call each other?

01:01:17.818 --> 01:01:18.779
Well...

01:01:19.417 --> 01:01:21.138
...look, I was kind of...

01:01:21.419 --> 01:01:22.899
...hoping for flowers.

01:01:30.459 --> 01:01:32.100
I could live here.

01:01:35.179 --> 01:01:36.660
I didn't say that to scare you.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.020
I scared you, didn't I?

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.299
No.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.060
So will you come and visit me?

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.821
You mean inland?

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.901
I don't go inland.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.420
We have a lake.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.901
A big lake.

01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:58.660
Okay. I'll just go back to
my work and my son and...

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.460
...you'll just forget about me, right?

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.541
Every day.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.142
I've got your number, sailor.

01:02:12.741 --> 01:02:14.622
And you've got mine. So....

01:02:27.301 --> 01:02:28.261
Bye.

01:03:54.182 --> 01:03:56.142
And then what happened?
Later, later.

01:03:57.543 --> 01:03:59.503
The wanderer returns.
How are you?

01:04:00.104 --> 01:04:02.062
Yeah? So, solve your mystery?

01:04:02.863 --> 01:04:04.583
There was no mystery.

01:04:04.863 --> 01:04:06.743
He lost his wife, Catherine.

01:04:07.383 --> 01:04:08.702
She was an artist.

01:04:08.944 --> 01:04:11.222
And dead but not forgotten.

01:04:11.503 --> 01:04:14.383
Right. So that's it,
end of story?

01:04:14.664 --> 01:04:17.024
Basically, yeah.
There's no story.

01:04:17.543 --> 01:04:19.983
Kind of like...
Was it me that said that?

01:04:21.103 --> 01:04:22.063
So!

01:04:22.343 --> 01:04:24.384
Toodle-loo, on your way.
That's enough.

01:04:26.945 --> 01:04:27.903
Any regrets?

01:04:29.303 --> 01:04:30.105
Zip.

01:04:30.344 --> 01:04:31.824
No? Good.

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:37.664
So, what was she like?

01:04:41.065 --> 01:04:44.186
She's beautiful and wispy and...

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:46.266
...a great artist.

01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:48.183
And she's everywhere.

01:04:48.423 --> 01:04:49.823
She's in his house.

01:04:50.063 --> 01:04:52.183
She's in the shop.

01:04:52.863 --> 01:04:53.823
The whole town knew her.

01:04:54.104 --> 01:04:55.503
Is he still in love with her?

01:04:56.944 --> 01:04:58.064
She isn't gone.

01:05:38.465 --> 01:05:41.066
That's for you.
And that's very interesting.

01:05:59.145 --> 01:06:00.704
Research. This is Theresa.

01:06:01.264 --> 01:06:02.465
Hi.

01:06:02.945 --> 01:06:04.224
It's me.

01:06:05.824 --> 01:06:07.025
Garret.

01:06:07.665 --> 01:06:08.785
I know.

01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:12.426
Sorry, I've been...

01:06:13.265 --> 01:06:15.146
I'm finishing the boat.

01:06:16.425 --> 01:06:17.305
My boat.

01:06:18.666 --> 01:06:20.386
I just wanted to tell you.

01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:22.506
How are you?

01:06:24.706 --> 01:06:26.746
It's been a quiet few weeks.

01:06:30.226 --> 01:06:31.506
I didn't know...

01:06:31.746 --> 01:06:33.067
...what to say.

01:06:34.546 --> 01:06:36.026
I still don't.

01:06:36.906 --> 01:06:38.307
Need some help?

01:06:39.506 --> 01:06:41.866
I was counting on it.

01:06:44.107 --> 01:06:45.148
Question:

01:06:45.387 --> 01:06:48.587
Were we just a casual thing
or something else?

01:06:49.067 --> 01:06:51.187
Possibly a beginning?

01:06:51.427 --> 01:06:53.468
Just answers, no pressure.

01:06:57.667 --> 01:07:00.267
Just a playboy?
Nail those tourist women.

01:07:00.507 --> 01:07:01.708
I've only...

01:07:02.628 --> 01:07:05.268
...cared about two women in my whole
life.

01:07:05.748 --> 01:07:07.067
Catherine and...?

01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:09.107
Some city girl.

01:07:09.509 --> 01:07:10.787
Big mouth.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.226
Pushy.

01:07:14.067 --> 01:07:15.187
Thanks.

01:07:16.386 --> 01:07:18.667
You just called
to tell me about the boat?

01:07:18.906 --> 01:07:19.947
No.

01:07:20.627 --> 01:07:21.587
I miss you.

01:07:23.467 --> 01:07:25.266
I miss all of it.

01:07:29.826 --> 01:07:32.027
Why don't you come see me, Garret?

01:07:33.667 --> 01:07:36.387
It's just a visit.
It's not a promise.

01:07:38.028 --> 01:07:39.428
Is that enough?

01:07:40.547 --> 01:07:43.108
Listen, you think I'm betting on us,
but I'm not.

01:07:43.347 --> 01:07:45.388
I'm just as scared as you are.

01:07:46.389 --> 01:07:48.268
And I miss you too.

01:07:50.709 --> 01:07:52.428
Okay. When?

01:07:53.508 --> 01:07:55.949
When should I come?

01:07:57.348 --> 01:07:58.829
Yesterday.

01:07:59.948 --> 01:08:01.430
You're not coming by boat,
are you?

01:08:01.669 --> 01:08:02.548
No.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.109
Jet Ski? Windsurfer?

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:16.830
So behave yourself.

01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:18.630
You got your ticket?

01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:22.747
Of course I have my ticket.

01:08:23.386 --> 01:08:24.788
Got my name on all my clothes.

01:08:25.069 --> 01:08:27.348
And I got a quarter for a phone call.

01:08:27.787 --> 01:08:29.667
You got a gift for that kid of hers?

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:32.787
Get one at the airplane gift shop.

01:08:33.549 --> 01:08:36.429
Don't get into any fights
or anything.

01:08:37.109 --> 01:08:37.988
There it comes.

01:08:38.308 --> 01:08:40.108
Right on time,
just like your old man.

01:08:40.388 --> 01:08:41.669
Don't throw your back out.

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:43.629
Take your pills.

01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:48.828
By my count, there should be 2 beers
left in the fridge when I get back.

01:08:49.707 --> 01:08:52.229
That's a sorry occupation,
counting other people's beers.

01:08:52.469 --> 01:08:55.029
If you get Kenny or
any tourist kids to score you beer...

01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:56.390
...I'll hear about it.

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:58.670
I got two counties covered.

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:04.270
That lady sure got you gut-hooked.

01:09:06.191 --> 01:09:07.590
How'd you get to be so mean?

01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:09.750
See you in a week.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:14.029
The hell you say!

01:09:14.831 --> 01:09:17.270
Not with your
plane ticket on the seat here!

01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:28.711
Good dog.

01:09:53.111 --> 01:09:54.751
I think he's here, Mom.

01:09:56.431 --> 01:09:57.471
Okay.

01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:02.751
You're kind of nervous.

01:10:03.031 --> 01:10:04.071
Really?

01:10:04.311 --> 01:10:05.711
I look great though, right?

01:10:06.192 --> 01:10:07.150
Okay.

01:10:07.392 --> 01:10:09.032
Okay, is what I meant.

01:10:15.152 --> 01:10:16.712
You made it.

01:10:18.471 --> 01:10:19.352
Come in.

01:10:22.432 --> 01:10:24.953
Jason?
- Hello.

01:10:25.192 --> 01:10:26.913
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:28.431 --> 01:10:31.392
I think he's disappointed that
you don't have a captain's hat on.

01:10:31.952 --> 01:10:34.072
That's what he was expecting.
Right?

01:10:34.312 --> 01:10:35.632
Come on in.

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:46.831
I don't know if it suits
a boy your age, but...

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.872
It's great.

01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:49.871
Thanks.

01:10:50.671 --> 01:10:51.871
Sweet, Garret.

01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:59.753
He's into this mayhem thing.

01:10:59.992 --> 01:11:01.712
I think it's a male deal.

01:11:05.872 --> 01:11:07.513
Garret, thank you.

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:10.033
She hates chocolates.

01:11:10.352 --> 01:11:11.673
It's really weird.

01:11:11.912 --> 01:11:12.712
True?

01:11:15.953 --> 01:11:18.514
Yes, but it was very sweet of you.

01:11:18.953 --> 01:11:20.273
Jason?
Excuse me.

01:11:25.274 --> 01:11:27.234
Thank you.
That's what I really wanted.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:38.634
You got to be beat, no?

01:11:42.074 --> 01:11:43.194
I hope this is okay.

01:11:43.434 --> 01:11:45.154
This is fine.

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.474
I mean, this is perfect.

01:11:49.075 --> 01:11:53.034
Tomorrow night, Jason will be at
a friend's house. So....

01:11:53.835 --> 01:11:55.873
Meaning what?

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.312
Shut up.

01:11:59.832 --> 01:12:02.393
- I know this isn't very romantic.
- What?

01:12:02.633 --> 01:12:03.674
This is my life.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:05.674
No, this is...

01:12:05.913 --> 01:12:07.393
...nice.

01:12:07.673 --> 01:12:08.794
It's nice.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:11.072
I just want you to know me.

01:12:11.673 --> 01:12:14.394
Just the day-to-day, regular me.

01:12:16.594 --> 01:12:18.234
You think you know me?

01:12:38.715 --> 01:12:39.515
What?

01:12:40.194 --> 01:12:41.075
What?

01:12:43.395 --> 01:12:44.675
He's not coming.

01:12:47.956 --> 01:12:49.515
But I've come so far.

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:52.476
Theresa...

01:12:56.195 --> 01:12:58.236
I don't even know.

01:13:02.236 --> 01:13:03.797
I'm glad you're here.

01:13:05.317 --> 01:13:07.114
I'm glad I'm here too.

01:13:25.596 --> 01:13:27.075
We're almost there.

01:13:39.636 --> 01:13:41.036
Wait. Is that him?

01:13:41.596 --> 01:13:42.556
That's him.

01:13:45.357 --> 01:13:47.075
Oh, my God.
Don't say a word.

01:13:47.396 --> 01:13:48.517
Hey, buddy!

01:13:48.756 --> 01:13:49.716
What are you doing here?

01:13:51.797 --> 01:13:53.117
Train's pretty cool.

01:13:53.356 --> 01:13:54.677
- Can I use the computer?
- Yeah.

01:13:55.356 --> 01:13:56.237
Hi.

01:13:56.477 --> 01:13:57.436
Hi.

01:13:58.396 --> 01:13:59.878
Jason wanted to surprise you.

01:14:00.757 --> 01:14:02.077
- Hope it's okay.
- It's fine.

01:14:02.358 --> 01:14:05.317
It's only for a minute, then
we'll hop back on that train.

01:14:05.558 --> 01:14:06.958
He's scared of it, Mom.

01:14:08.758 --> 01:14:10.397
I'm not scared of it.

01:14:11.318 --> 01:14:12.198
Hello.

01:14:13.438 --> 01:14:15.238
Annie. Garret.

01:14:16.398 --> 01:14:17.358
Hi.

01:14:17.595 --> 01:14:20.037
This is where I work.

01:14:21.755 --> 01:14:23.316
Hi.
Hi.

01:14:25.556 --> 01:14:27.036
It was nice meeting you.

01:14:34.677 --> 01:14:37.876
Well, now I can
picture you on the job.

01:14:42.556 --> 01:14:44.437
So that's him. That's Ahab?

01:14:44.798 --> 01:14:46.598
That's him.
He's no Captain Ahab.

01:14:46.878 --> 01:14:48.437
Smile at him. Be friendly.

01:14:50.239 --> 01:14:51.878
Friendly people.
I know.

01:14:52.158 --> 01:14:54.037
He's smiling at her.
That's sweet.

01:14:54.278 --> 01:14:55.919
Oh, behave!

01:14:57.118 --> 01:15:00.558
You're so negative, Charlie.
Don't you want her to be happy?

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:04.397
She'll smell of haddock
for the rest of her life.

01:15:05.438 --> 01:15:07.238
I don't know what I was expecting.

01:15:07.478 --> 01:15:09.278
I mean, I didn't realize...

01:15:09.598 --> 01:15:10.718
...everybody's close.

01:15:11.879 --> 01:15:14.519
Theresa, this came as
a big surprise to me...

01:15:14.758 --> 01:15:18.280
...but apparently it is the poodle
that is the number one dog.

01:15:18.878 --> 01:15:20.919
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.719
- Hi, Lina.
- Hi, Jason.

01:15:24.359 --> 01:15:27.959
Jason is taking Garret
into town sailing now.

01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:29.118
Really? So soon?

01:15:29.398 --> 01:15:31.198
If he doesn't get lost first.

01:15:31.598 --> 01:15:33.318
I know there's a lake
around here somewhere.

01:15:33.558 --> 01:15:34.597
He senses that.

01:15:34.879 --> 01:15:37.677
Sensitive. If you
get into any trouble at all...

01:15:37.919 --> 01:15:40.717
...certainly give me...
the paper a call.

01:15:42.278 --> 01:15:44.317
You want to steer?
Sure.

01:15:44.558 --> 01:15:45.758
You're the captain.

01:15:46.278 --> 01:15:48.719
You got to keep us going straight.

01:15:49.159 --> 01:15:50.558
Straight ahead.

01:15:58.039 --> 01:15:59.839
Hi.
Hi.

01:16:00.759 --> 01:16:01.720
Here you go.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.320
How you doing?
Good.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.080
The gang.
Hi, Lenny.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.279
Bye, Mom.
Have fun.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.080
Say bye to your mom.
See you!

01:16:42.759 --> 01:16:44.759
I'm not used to having you here.

01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:50.199
It's okay, Garret.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.080
It's nice...

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.079
...being among your things.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.840
Well, is it what you expected?

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.720
It's comforting.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:28.161
You're making me self-conscious.

01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:31.641
What are you looking at?

01:17:32.441 --> 01:17:34.203
Theresa in her home.

01:17:38.642 --> 01:17:40.522
The regular everyday...

01:17:41.283 --> 01:17:42.602
...Theresa.

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:00.602
Wait.

01:18:02.201 --> 01:18:03.481
I really...

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:05.801
...wanted to make this right.

01:18:07.121 --> 01:18:10.801
I just wanted to straighten up
my room and light a candle and....

01:18:13.642 --> 01:18:15.562
And I need to take a shower.

01:18:23.041 --> 01:18:24.561
Garret, wait.

01:20:03.046 --> 01:20:05.965
One, two, three...

01:20:06.206 --> 01:20:08.965
...four, five, six.

01:20:11.125 --> 01:20:12.645
That was a goodie.
So scared.

01:20:12.886 --> 01:20:14.404
I'm so scared.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.163
That was big.

01:20:18.605 --> 01:20:21.843
I'm going to take a shower. Finally.

01:20:24.924 --> 01:20:26.365
Wait. Just...

01:22:10.327 --> 01:22:12.327
You're not going to believe what...

01:22:17.809 --> 01:22:19.889
Oh, God. Garret.

01:22:20.208 --> 01:22:22.008
Where did you get this?

01:22:25.889 --> 01:22:26.928
I found it.

01:22:27.168 --> 01:22:28.889
What do you mean, you found it?

01:22:29.128 --> 01:22:30.889
I found it on the shore.

01:22:32.288 --> 01:22:33.649
Garret, wait.

01:22:34.368 --> 01:22:36.247
It came to me.

01:22:36.688 --> 01:22:38.327
You have to trust me.

01:22:38.767 --> 01:22:39.607
Trust you?

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:44.087
I just had to meet the person
that wrote it. I had to meet you.

01:22:44.407 --> 01:22:46.687
- I was going to tell you before.
- How could you find me?

01:22:46.927 --> 01:22:51.287
Because I tracked all of the messages
and there were clues...

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.567
All of the messages?

01:22:55.728 --> 01:22:58.728
They've all been found and people
saw it in the column and they wrote.

01:22:58.969 --> 01:23:01.449
I swear to God, I was
going to tell you, Garret.

01:23:01.688 --> 01:23:02.609
Garret, wait.

01:23:02.848 --> 01:23:04.288
I got to get out of here.

01:23:09.329 --> 01:23:10.329
Garret, wait!

01:23:10.568 --> 01:23:12.249
Why did you do this?

01:23:13.129 --> 01:23:14.329
Why?!

01:23:16.329 --> 01:23:18.050
Were you curious?

01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:22.089
It's goddamn research!
I'm falling in love with you!

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.969
First in the letters
and then when I met you!

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:27.129
And I'm sorry! I was afraid!

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:30.050
I was afraid if I told you
that I would push you away!

01:23:30.289 --> 01:23:31.890
Just like I'm doing now.

01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:34.489
Wait!

01:23:34.731 --> 01:23:36.009
No matter what you think of me...

01:23:36.251 --> 01:23:37.929
...and no matter what happens now,
I want you to know...

01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:39.451
...how much I care for you.

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:41.971
And it shouldn't matter...

01:23:42.210 --> 01:23:44.611
...what brought us together, Garret.

01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:47.729
I sent those letters into the sea
to her. Not to you!

01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:49.609
Not to all your friends at work!

01:23:49.848 --> 01:23:50.809
I know.

01:23:51.048 --> 01:23:52.930
They all knew about me, didn't they?

01:23:53.648 --> 01:23:55.088
All about Catherine?

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:58.808
My life was changed
by those three letters.

01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:01.049
- I didn't want it printed in the paper.
- Two letters.

01:24:01.289 --> 01:24:04.090
- You've got to believe me.
- I sent two letters to Catherine.

01:24:06.329 --> 01:24:07.370
What?

01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:10.689
I have all of the letters.
I have all three.

01:24:13.289 --> 01:24:14.809
Where's the third letter?

01:24:16.329 --> 01:24:17.970
Is it in that drawer?

01:24:26.611 --> 01:24:27.890
Catherine?

01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:31.891
Catherine?

01:24:52.932 --> 01:24:54.932
To all the ships at sea...

01:24:55.212 --> 01:24:57.252
...and all the ports of call.

01:24:57.491 --> 01:24:58.810
To my family...

01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:01.251
...and to all friends and strangers.

01:25:01.891 --> 01:25:04.851
This is a message and a prayer.

01:25:05.531 --> 01:25:09.091
The message is that my travels
taught me a great truth.

01:25:10.811 --> 01:25:13.251
I already had what everyone
is searching for...

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:15.170
...and few ever find:

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:17.611
The one person in the world...

01:25:17.851 --> 01:25:20.331
...who I was born to love forever.

01:25:20.931 --> 01:25:24.572
A person like me, of the Outer Banks...

01:25:24.811 --> 01:25:26.972
...and the blue Atlantic mystery.

01:25:29.131 --> 01:25:31.692
A person rich in simple treasures...

01:25:31.932 --> 01:25:34.812
...self-made, self-taught.

01:25:36.492 --> 01:25:39.132
A harbor where I am forever home.

01:25:39.371 --> 01:25:42.092
And no wind or trouble...

01:25:42.532 --> 01:25:46.373
...or even a little death
can knock down this house.

01:25:48.893 --> 01:25:53.814
The prayer is that everyone in the
world can know this kind of love...

01:25:54.013 --> 01:25:56.093
...and be healed by it.

01:25:56.453 --> 01:26:01.093
If my prayer is heard, then there
will be an erasing of all guilt...

01:26:01.334 --> 01:26:03.294
...and all regret...

01:26:03.574 --> 01:26:06.174
...and an end to all anger.

01:26:07.053 --> 01:26:08.493
Please, God.

01:26:09.413 --> 01:26:10.652
Amen.

01:26:21.371 --> 01:26:23.492
I never knew what she wrote.

01:26:26.172 --> 01:26:27.493
She...

01:26:28.092 --> 01:26:30.172
...never came back from that day.

01:26:32.932 --> 01:26:35.814
I dried her.
I tried to keep her warm.

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:38.693
Took her to the hospital.

01:26:39.813 --> 01:26:41.254
She never....

01:26:45.574 --> 01:26:48.014
She died three days later.

01:26:50.534 --> 01:26:53.013
I keep thinking if she hadn't
gone out that day...

01:26:53.254 --> 01:26:54.774
Garret, she knew.

01:26:57.974 --> 01:26:59.494
She said it.

01:27:00.695 --> 01:27:04.454
"Not even a little death can
knock down this house." She knew.

01:27:10.214 --> 01:27:11.655
I want to...

01:27:11.975 --> 01:27:13.455
...keep this.

01:28:19.216 --> 01:28:21.137
Hi.
Hi.

01:28:21.657 --> 01:28:24.536
I'm sorry.
Would you rather be alone?

01:28:31.018 --> 01:28:32.536
Has he called?

01:28:33.616 --> 01:28:34.535
No.

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.455
I left him a message, though.

01:28:39.455 --> 01:28:41.215
I said I was sorry.

01:28:42.376 --> 01:28:44.296
And I asked him to call.

01:28:45.816 --> 01:28:47.616
Well, then, he will.

01:28:50.416 --> 01:28:52.176
Lina, do you remember...

01:28:53.056 --> 01:28:55.495
...what I was always complaining about?

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:58.697
All those times you let me cry
on your shoulder about David.

01:28:58.937 --> 01:29:00.136
Remember?

01:29:01.296 --> 01:29:03.776
Honesty. Trust.

01:29:08.257 --> 01:29:10.057
I was so scared.

01:29:11.656 --> 01:29:12.857
I don't....

01:29:13.897 --> 01:29:16.697
I was falling in love
with Garret and I....

01:29:18.257 --> 01:29:19.897
Half of my mind was saying,
"Tell him"...

01:29:20.137 --> 01:29:22.097
...and the other half was saying:

01:29:24.378 --> 01:29:27.137
"Just wait. He's not
going to understand.

01:29:27.499 --> 01:29:28.579
Wait till the right moment.

01:29:28.818 --> 01:29:31.418
Just wait till you have the
right words." You know?

01:29:32.538 --> 01:29:34.819
And I blew it. I just...

01:29:35.058 --> 01:29:37.658
...killed it by being what I hate:

01:29:37.899 --> 01:29:38.859
A liar.

01:29:39.098 --> 01:29:40.618
You're not a liar.

01:29:41.698 --> 01:29:43.539
But to him I am.

01:29:45.456 --> 01:29:48.457
And I don't think he's ever
going to be able to trust me now.

01:29:48.936 --> 01:29:51.418
Don't you understand we all
have our own little lies...

01:29:51.657 --> 01:29:54.257
...and our little unspoken truths?

01:29:54.497 --> 01:29:58.297
And you just have to have a little
faith that he'll understand that.

01:30:00.377 --> 01:30:01.818
I don't know.

01:30:03.818 --> 01:30:05.737
I don't know if he can.

01:30:08.257 --> 01:30:12.778
I saw his pain. He was holding her
letter and he was reading it.

01:30:13.058 --> 01:30:14.779
And there was just...

01:30:16.418 --> 01:30:18.698
...so much pain and....

01:30:19.658 --> 01:30:22.338
He has so much love for her,
you know?

01:30:25.218 --> 01:30:26.458
I don't know.

01:31:03.618 --> 01:31:04.858
Marta?

01:31:13.659 --> 01:31:15.018
Marta!

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:55.060
Yeah.

01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:59.100
You said if I was ever thinking about
writing a piece for the paper....

01:32:00.422 --> 01:32:01.341
No kidding.

01:32:04.421 --> 01:32:05.861
Is he in here?

01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:07.340
No.

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.539
Other stories.

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.220
Good stories.

01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:13.340
It's about time.

01:32:15.501 --> 01:32:17.740
People get hurt, they shut down.

01:32:18.421 --> 01:32:20.181
Till the pain goes away?

01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:22.701
I don't know.

01:32:23.381 --> 01:32:27.220
Maybe you just learn to take it in
like everything else.

01:32:28.541 --> 01:32:31.421
Kind of like a few pieces of cork
in a great glass of wine.

01:32:31.661 --> 01:32:33.340
You don't want to miss the wine.

01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:36.541
Is that in here?

01:32:36.782 --> 01:32:38.822
The cork in the wine thing?

01:32:39.781 --> 01:32:40.582
No.

01:32:40.822 --> 01:32:42.862
Good. I hate it.

01:32:49.142 --> 01:32:52.582
It may be that most of us
write our own life story...

01:32:52.822 --> 01:32:54.822
...making it up as we go along.

01:32:55.701 --> 01:32:59.703
But others seem to have lives
that are already shaped and planned...

01:33:00.302 --> 01:33:01.943
...inescapable...

01:33:02.303 --> 01:33:04.542
...perfect as a circle.

01:35:01.464 --> 01:35:02.745
Okay.

01:35:04.226 --> 01:35:05.504
Open it.

01:35:06.705 --> 01:35:08.065
Slowly.

01:35:13.185 --> 01:35:15.105
- This is exciting.
- It is.

01:35:20.985 --> 01:35:22.666
Front page of the section!
Great!

01:35:23.546 --> 01:35:24.426
Thanks, bud.

01:35:24.666 --> 01:35:25.826
Can I cut it out?

01:35:26.306 --> 01:35:27.225
Sure.

01:35:28.946 --> 01:35:30.866
Is this okay?
That is great.

01:35:31.106 --> 01:35:33.066
That's perfect. Thank you.

01:35:40.424 --> 01:35:41.465
Here's your mail, ma'am.

01:35:41.704 --> 01:35:42.504
Thank you.

01:35:42.745 --> 01:35:43.625
Sure.

01:36:14.786 --> 01:36:16.267
Nice.

01:36:16.866 --> 01:36:18.826
I love what you've done here.

01:36:19.786 --> 01:36:21.787
- Very minimalist.
- Very nice of you to stop by, sir.

01:36:22.027 --> 01:36:26.067
Yes, well, I come bearing a gift
for your new phone booth office.

01:36:26.306 --> 01:36:27.907
- Can I hang it?
- That is so sweet.

01:36:28.147 --> 01:36:29.587
I know.

01:36:36.387 --> 01:36:38.267
You'll never guess who it is.

01:36:43.147 --> 01:36:44.508
You seem happy.

01:36:44.748 --> 01:36:46.708
Is anything all right?

01:36:50.468 --> 01:36:51.866
Ahab.

01:36:53.427 --> 01:36:54.507
May I?

01:36:58.547 --> 01:37:01.547
If you decide to go do something
wild and ridiculous...

01:37:01.786 --> 01:37:03.507
...it'll only prove one thing.

01:37:03.746 --> 01:37:05.307
And what's that?

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:10.267
He's one lucky old son of the sea.

01:37:15.666 --> 01:37:17.907
That's a Charlie Toschi quote.

01:37:33.908 --> 01:37:37.428
You know, somebody's going to think
you're drying your skivvies up there.

01:37:41.508 --> 01:37:42.909
You look nice.

01:37:43.148 --> 01:37:45.069
Yeah, well, it hurts.

01:38:12.308 --> 01:38:14.268
She's beautiful, Garret.

01:38:15.428 --> 01:38:16.788
Thanks, Marta.

01:38:18.708 --> 01:38:20.189
Go get them!

01:38:25.749 --> 01:38:26.909
Nice job, Garret.

01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:56.110
To Catherine.

01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:57.471
To Catherine.

01:38:58.630 --> 01:38:59.671
Wish to God...

01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:05.471
Wish to God she was here today.

01:39:10.712 --> 01:39:12.151
Every day.

01:40:51.192 --> 01:40:53.313
My dad said you were there.

01:40:53.712 --> 01:40:55.153
Wish I'd have known.

01:40:56.473 --> 01:40:58.873
A surprise. Dumb idea.

01:40:59.113 --> 01:41:00.393
No, it's....

01:41:01.273 --> 01:41:02.872
It's great to see you.

01:41:05.273 --> 01:41:07.394
- Glad you came.
- Me too.

01:41:08.474 --> 01:41:11.074
I saw the boat. It's beautiful.

01:41:11.313 --> 01:41:12.634
It's great.

01:41:13.553 --> 01:41:15.154
I'm happy for you.

01:41:15.833 --> 01:41:17.634
You want to come inside?

01:41:23.354 --> 01:41:24.554
Theresa...

01:41:37.913 --> 01:41:39.312
I'm sorry.

01:41:40.792 --> 01:41:42.833
What I said must've hurt you.

01:41:44.753 --> 01:41:45.952
No.

01:41:47.673 --> 01:41:50.474
I just heard what
you couldn't tell me.

01:41:52.353 --> 01:41:54.473
Or maybe what I couldn't hear.

01:41:54.873 --> 01:41:56.953
And I understand now.

01:41:58.073 --> 01:42:00.514
I think it's so beautiful
the way you love her.

01:42:00.754 --> 01:42:02.754
No, you don't have to say anything.

01:42:03.314 --> 01:42:05.914
It's what made me want to find you.

01:42:11.195 --> 01:42:12.394
Then stay with me.

01:42:12.635 --> 01:42:13.795
Come inside.

01:42:14.074 --> 01:42:15.795
Just stay as long as you want.

01:42:16.034 --> 01:42:19.594
I thought about it. I thought about
a lot of things sitting out here.

01:42:20.595 --> 01:42:21.714
And I can't stay.

01:42:22.035 --> 01:42:23.076
Why?

01:42:23.315 --> 01:42:24.995
Because if you can,
you'll come to me...

01:42:25.235 --> 01:42:28.756
...when it's right.
And if it's not right, it's okay.

01:42:29.836 --> 01:42:31.435
Because I wouldn't...

01:42:32.036 --> 01:42:33.755
...regret one minute.

01:42:35.076 --> 01:42:36.035
Not one.

01:42:39.236 --> 01:42:40.436
Bye.

01:42:45.757 --> 01:42:46.676
Theresa....

01:42:50.114 --> 01:42:52.034
I don't want to lose you.

01:42:55.035 --> 01:42:56.355
Then don't.

01:43:13.396 --> 01:43:16.116
Why do you always sit
in the same place?

01:43:16.355 --> 01:43:17.836
What the hell you care where I sit?

01:43:18.076 --> 01:43:21.676
I'm curious. You started
sitting here 10, 11 years ago.

01:43:21.915 --> 01:43:22.915
For chrissake!

01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:24.957
You used to sit over there.

01:43:35.397 --> 01:43:37.236
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:43:41.037 --> 01:43:43.038
Get the boy a cup of coffee.

01:43:49.598 --> 01:43:51.118
You look like hell.

01:43:53.438 --> 01:43:54.718
I'm okay.

01:43:55.677 --> 01:43:57.318
Catch up to her?

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:03.036
You let her go.

01:44:04.356 --> 01:44:05.876
I don't want to talk about it.

01:44:06.116 --> 01:44:07.436
Listen, I was...
Go away.

01:44:14.557 --> 01:44:16.197
She made up her mind.

01:44:16.596 --> 01:44:18.597
- The hell you want?
- Persistence.

01:44:18.837 --> 01:44:21.557
Get crazy. Go nuts.
A fight, for chrissake.

01:44:21.837 --> 01:44:23.477
You spent one afternoon with her.

01:44:24.676 --> 01:44:26.756
You don't even know who she is.

01:44:28.958 --> 01:44:29.758
What's...?

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:31.437
Chicago.

01:44:31.917 --> 01:44:33.958
Three minutes. Get on the phone.

01:44:37.678 --> 01:44:39.558
It's your last chance.

01:44:49.557 --> 01:44:51.358
Of course she walked away.

01:44:51.678 --> 01:44:53.079
She ain't stupid.

01:44:54.959 --> 01:44:56.398
Think she wants to try
to come between you and...

01:44:56.638 --> 01:44:59.038
I don't have it figured out.
Who the hell does?

01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.239
Think it's easy for me to see
another woman in your house?

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.919
Well, it ain't easy.

01:45:04.479 --> 01:45:06.159
I'll tell you one thing...

01:45:06.439 --> 01:45:08.560
...I'd give a million bucks
to see you grab her...

01:45:08.799 --> 01:45:10.238
...and figure it out as you go along.

01:45:10.477 --> 01:45:11.278
Just drop it!

01:45:11.477 --> 01:45:12.758
- Drop it?
- Yeah. Drop it!

01:45:12.997 --> 01:45:14.118
Just...

01:45:17.318 --> 01:45:18.637
...forget about it.

01:45:19.478 --> 01:45:20.478
I can't!

01:45:25.159 --> 01:45:26.478
I can't forget about it.

01:45:27.799 --> 01:45:29.238
Why the hell not?

01:45:30.399 --> 01:45:32.318
Because you're my boy.

01:45:34.879 --> 01:45:36.758
- It's not your business.
- What?

01:45:36.998 --> 01:45:39.639
I said it's not your business!

01:45:40.519 --> 01:45:42.558
Turn around. Hey!

01:45:43.319 --> 01:45:44.799
Turn around.

01:45:46.158 --> 01:45:47.719
Make a fist.

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.359
Make it!

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.440
Now you hit me!

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:54.080
Hit me in the face,
you son of a bitch.

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.480
Not my business?

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.960
My son is not my business?

01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.719
What the hell else have I got...

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.879
...that's close to me?

01:46:07.841 --> 01:46:09.280
Who else ever...

01:46:10.401 --> 01:46:11.961
...stuck up for me?

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.001
Think I don't know your pain?
I do.

01:46:14.881 --> 01:46:18.280
Some of it I put there.
Think I can forget that?

01:46:20.601 --> 01:46:22.959
When she went to New York,
you could've gone with her...

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.679
...and here I was, sick,
drunk, flat on my ass...

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.519
...bringing you down.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.199
- Maybe it could've been different.
- Dad!

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.759
I didn't stay for you.

01:46:39.279 --> 01:46:40.599
This is who I am.

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:43.400
This place.
This is where I belong.

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:47.120
She came back because she found out
she belonged here too.

01:46:47.359 --> 01:46:49.520
She chose for herself.

01:46:51.921 --> 01:46:53.921
God, I loved her for that.

01:46:55.961 --> 01:46:57.601
So did I.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.761
Now you choose. Choose...

01:47:02.001 --> 01:47:05.442
...between yesterday and tomorrow.
Pick one.

01:47:06.521 --> 01:47:07.841
Stick with it.

01:47:08.442 --> 01:47:10.122
And I will shut up...

01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:12.482
...and leave you alone.

01:47:43.841 --> 01:47:46.722
"So you'll always know where you are...

01:47:47.081 --> 01:47:48.922
...and where home is.

01:47:51.002 --> 01:47:52.642
Love, Theresa."

01:48:49.163 --> 01:48:50.123
Hey!

01:48:51.523 --> 01:48:53.603
You heading for blue water?

01:48:54.562 --> 01:48:55.602
Yes, sir.

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:59.003
Well, you know what you're doing.

01:49:00.163 --> 01:49:02.323
Got it all figured out.

01:50:08.364 --> 01:50:09.244
Hey, bud.

01:50:10.125 --> 01:50:11.284
Time to get up.

01:50:13.924 --> 01:50:15.405
Another day.

01:54:02.011 --> 01:54:05.090
They call him the Mayor of 43rd.

01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:08.890
He's so sweet. He knows everyone.
Helps people.

01:54:09.450 --> 01:54:12.411
The point is, it's his
seventieth birthday.

01:54:13.331 --> 01:54:16.090
Theresa, there's a phone call
for you.

01:54:16.331 --> 01:54:17.491
Can you take a message?

01:54:17.770 --> 01:54:18.891
It's urgent.

01:54:21.172 --> 01:54:22.491
Excuse me.

01:54:22.732 --> 01:54:24.332
You better take it in my office.

01:54:24.571 --> 01:54:26.011
Is it Jase?

01:54:29.972 --> 01:54:30.932
Hello?

01:54:31.572 --> 01:54:32.852
Hey, girl.

01:54:33.891 --> 01:54:35.052
Dodge?

01:54:35.572 --> 01:54:37.172
I better...

01:54:38.132 --> 01:54:41.850
...get this said
while I can still talk.

01:54:42.891 --> 01:54:46.450
There was a boat, Theresa,
offshore in trouble.

01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:48.451
A family, there was three of them.

01:54:48.691 --> 01:54:50.251
Garret tried...

01:54:51.331 --> 01:54:53.931
Well, he tried to help, and...

01:54:55.531 --> 01:54:58.210
It's bad. He went down.

01:55:00.210 --> 01:55:01.491
What do you mean?

01:55:01.771 --> 01:55:03.092
He went in after them.

01:55:03.331 --> 01:55:06.931
He got two of them.
But he went down, Theresa.

01:55:08.092 --> 01:55:09.932
I am so sorry.

01:55:12.691 --> 01:55:14.572
That's all I got now.

01:55:16.372 --> 01:55:17.652
Bye.

01:55:18.892 --> 01:55:19.853
Okay.

01:55:22.813 --> 01:55:24.532
Oh, my God.

01:57:19.014 --> 01:57:20.054
Hey.

01:57:24.895 --> 01:57:26.455
Hard times.

01:57:26.814 --> 01:57:28.255
Come on in.

01:57:36.015 --> 01:57:37.695
I found it on the boat.

01:57:38.335 --> 01:57:39.936
It was in his slicker.

01:58:02.896 --> 01:58:04.376
Dear Catherine:

01:58:04.896 --> 01:58:06.616
My life began when I found you...

01:58:06.857 --> 01:58:09.776
...and I thought it had ended
when I failed to save you.

01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:14.295
I thought that hanging on to your
memory was keeping us both alive.

01:58:14.535 --> 01:58:15.855
But I was wrong.

01:58:16.256 --> 01:58:18.055
A woman named Theresa
showed me that...

01:58:18.295 --> 01:58:20.615
...if I was brave enough to
open my heart...

01:58:20.856 --> 01:58:23.936
...I could love again,
no matter how terrible my grief.

01:58:24.255 --> 01:58:27.215
She made me realize
I was only half-alive.

01:58:27.455 --> 01:58:29.576
It scared me and it hurt.

01:58:29.815 --> 01:58:34.336
I didn't know how much I needed her
till the night she flew away.

01:58:35.615 --> 01:58:39.536
When that airplane took off, I felt
something inside me tear away.

01:58:39.856 --> 01:58:40.976
And I knew.

01:58:41.216 --> 01:58:42.657
I should have stopped her.

01:58:42.896 --> 01:58:44.896
I should've followed her home.

01:58:45.376 --> 01:58:47.936
And now tomorrow, I'm going to sail
to the windy point...

01:58:48.217 --> 01:58:50.457
...and I'm going to say goodbye to you.

01:58:51.457 --> 01:58:53.337
Then I'm going to go to this woman...

01:58:53.578 --> 01:58:55.897
...and see if I can win her heart.

02:00:04.418 --> 02:00:06.338
If I can, I know you'll bless me.

02:00:06.579 --> 02:00:08.018
And bless us all.

02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:09.899
If I can't...

02:00:10.139 --> 02:00:12.779
...then I'm still blessed because
I've had the privilege of loving...

02:00:13.018 --> 02:00:14.658
...twice in my life.

02:00:15.098 --> 02:00:16.419
She gave me that.

02:00:16.658 --> 02:00:20.019
And if I tell you I love her
as much as I loved you...

02:00:20.299 --> 02:00:22.300
...then you'll know the whole story.

02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:26.380
Rest in peace, my love.

02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:27.619
Garret.

02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:58.299
If some lives form a perfect circle...

02:00:58.979 --> 02:01:03.900
...others take shape in ways we cannot
predict or always understand.

02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:07.699
Loss has been a part of my journey.

02:01:08.099 --> 02:01:11.299
But it has also shown me
what is precious.

02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:16.100
So has a love for which
I can only be grateful.
