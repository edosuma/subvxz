WEBVTT

00:08.480 --> 00:09.834
HOLDEN: Dr. Strickland pulled
your daughter

00:09.920 --> 00:11.991
out of the clinic an hour
before the battle started.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.355
I believe we'll
find your daughter.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.999
We'll leave the <i>Somnabulist</i>
once we dock

00:15.080 --> 00:16.673
and then we'll intermingle
with the locals.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.831
I'm gonna take the <i>Roci</i>
and mosey on down

00:18.920 --> 00:20.070
to the dark side of Ganymede.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.196
<i>I'm gonna tuck her</i>

00:21.280 --> 00:23.192
<i>behind one of those
71 cute little moons.</i>

00:23.280 --> 00:26.671
And we'll rendezvous at one of
these service air locks here.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.274
Are your plans
always this vague?

00:28.360 --> 00:29.794
This is about average.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.880
We mistook a training exercise
as an active engagement

00:32.960 --> 00:34.474
and opened fire
without orders.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.676
CHRISJEN: What was the reason?

00:36.160 --> 00:37.435
We thought we were
under attack.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.715
CHRISJEN: Under attack?

00:39.600 --> 00:41.557
So you were fired upon?

00:41.640 --> 00:43.711
He was trying to
kill the enemy.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.439
I didn't even know
what it was, nobody did.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.954
He wasn't wearing
a vac suit...

00:47.280 --> 00:49.636
She knows
we're working together.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.553
<i>Forced me to explore
other options.</i>

00:51.640 --> 00:52.630
SADAVIR:
<i>You need me.</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:55.030
You need my government's
resources and my protection.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.520
CHRISJEN: Eros
changes everything...

00:59.600 --> 01:02.911
Just like a soldier
on Ganymede without a suit.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.195
We're taking all of the
cargo and the ship.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.630
All clear!

01:13.320 --> 01:14.390
I'm sorry.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.790
Go! Get off
my ship!

01:16.880 --> 01:17.916
Go!

01:20.680 --> 01:22.672
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:41.280 --> 02:42.760
We shouldn't have
left her alone.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.234
She didn't want us there.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.159
We got her husband killed.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.197
Those cops were going
to kill them both.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.189
It was the right move.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.274
I'm going to keep
telling myself that.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.357
If we do what we came
here to do,

02:54.440 --> 02:56.079
I'll figure out a way
to live with it.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.440
How many people
have you killed?

03:10.600 --> 03:11.670
I'm not sure.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.076
You're not sure?

03:14.120 --> 03:15.998
Well, I'm not
a homicidal maniac.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.993
Holden and Naomi,
they're not like me.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.230
They're better.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.430
I'll watch your back,

03:22.520 --> 03:23.954
but they'll find
your little girl.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.557
NAOMI: It's a directory
of the dead and missing.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.635
Let's see if they're on it.

03:38.720 --> 03:39.870
She's not dead.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.996
And Strickland's not
dead or missing,

03:44.080 --> 03:45.150
which is good.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.440
They could both
still be here.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.674
Where was Strickland
when he took Mei?

03:50.240 --> 03:52.755
Ganymede Pediatric Care,
Clinic 7.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.317
Let's see if anyone who
worked there is still around.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.476
There's a few.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.595
- They're all in Ag Dome 9.
- This way.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.719
PRAX: This is where
I used to work.

04:59.880 --> 05:00.916
It was beautiful.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.399
I'll try using
my imagination.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.912
A single soldier kills
a dozen Marines

05:18.000 --> 05:20.390
on the surface of Ganymede
without a vac suit?

05:20.640 --> 05:21.869
(SCOFFS) Please.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.951
The MMC trains their people
to believe they're invincible,

05:25.040 --> 05:27.032
and that failure
is an unacceptable option.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.676
Well, Sergeant Draper failed.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.716
And then she snapped,

05:29.800 --> 05:30.836
because she couldn't
deal with it.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.876
So you think she's lying.

05:31.960 --> 05:32.996
I think she's crazy.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.675
Still,
I wouldn't mind getting her in a room alone.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.277
She seemed perfectly sane
to me.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.995
And after Eros,
my definition of crazy

05:41.080 --> 05:42.673
has contracted significantly.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.114
Well, she has
zero credibility.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.475
There's no point talking
to her again.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.791
The point is that something
was bothering her

05:47.880 --> 05:49.394
and she was ordered
to suppress it.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.118
Mars is using peace
as a distraction.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.473
CHRISJEN: "Peace as
a distraction."

05:54.800 --> 05:57.269
God, I wish I could disagree
with you right now.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.477
Our apologies
if we kept you waiting.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.950
SADAVIR: Not at all.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.274
How is Sergeant Draper?

06:03.400 --> 06:04.959
In her quarters,
resting.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.869
CHRISJEN: And in
no frame of mind

06:06.960 --> 06:08.952
to answer any more
questions, I assume?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.196
I'm afraid not.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.795
The traumatized mind
is a dark place.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.030
But rest assured,
we're here,

06:14.120 --> 06:15.554
and happy to help
any way we can.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.553
We have Earth's best doctors
at our disposal.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.314
Thank you,
but the medical team at our embassy

06:21.440 --> 06:22.430
is more than able.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.914
And if it's absolutely
necessary,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.798
we can arrange
for further testimony

06:25.880 --> 06:27.633
after the sergeant
has fully recovered.

06:27.960 --> 06:28.916
But right now,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.071
we need to finalize
the terms of our accord.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.799
Who was the officer
who spirited

06:34.880 --> 06:36.394
Sergeant Draper away?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.518
A friend of
Sergeant Draper's family

06:38.600 --> 06:40.159
here to offer moral support.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.716
He didn't seem like
the supportive type.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.871
Madam, your ships
are still heading

06:44.960 --> 06:46.394
towards ours at Ganymede.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.435
So unless your intention

06:48.520 --> 06:50.432
is to have us shooting
at each other again...

06:52.200 --> 06:53.873
Let's do what we came
here to do.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.000
You really fucked up
in there, Gunny.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.670
I know.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.793
- But I know I saw something.
- Ah, yes.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.118
A man standing on the surface
of Ganymede

07:06.880 --> 07:08.234
without a vac suit.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.832
Are you absolutely sure
about that?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.352
(SIGHS)
So you think I'm crazy.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.230
I think we asked too
much of you too soon.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.193
(SIGHS) Bobbie,

07:21.280 --> 07:24.000
truth and fact are
not the same thing.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.355
Now I know this may be
too much for you

07:25.440 --> 07:26.920
to grab a hold of right now.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.589
But you believe what
you saw is true

07:30.720 --> 07:32.598
because you need it
to be true.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.800
To explain how your team
was killed.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.395
So what happens now?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.792
Now you go home
back to Mars.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.596
You've earned it.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.836
And then what?

07:47.640 --> 07:49.757
Then we do what's best
for you and for the Corps.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.633
I'd like to see the ocean
before I leave.

07:57.840 --> 07:58.910
If that's possible?

07:59.920 --> 08:01.877
Sorry. You're under
restrictions now.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.156
You mean I'm a prisoner.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.230
No.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.432
I mean, you're a Martian.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.639
It takes weeks,
sometimes months,

08:08.720 --> 08:10.359
to acclimate
to these open spaces.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.352
You saw what happened
when we stepped off the ship.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.715
You're breathing
natural air.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.439
You're trying
to orient yourself

08:15.520 --> 08:17.034
with that damned horizon.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.556
Just rest.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.109
A transport is coming
to get you.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.919
You'll be shipping out
day after tomorrow.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.440
Open the shades.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.430
Close them.

09:29.880 --> 09:30.870
UN TECH:
<i>Our analysts confirmed</i>

09:30.960 --> 09:31.950
<i>that Sergeant Draper's</i>

09:32.040 --> 09:34.430
<i>power armor was subjected to
massive concussive</i>

09:34.520 --> 09:35.556
<i>and incendiary forces.</i>

09:35.640 --> 09:37.677
<i>And the suit's internal
data logs, as far as they go,</i>

09:37.760 --> 09:40.320
<i>are consistent with the MCRN's
account of the battle.</i>

09:41.240 --> 09:42.913
The Martians wouldn't have
given us the armor

09:43.000 --> 09:44.116
if it were otherwise.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.030
What about biologicals?

09:46.360 --> 09:47.680
UN TECH:
<i>Well, we did find traces</i>

09:47.760 --> 09:48.989
<i>of various plant material,</i>

09:49.080 --> 09:51.197
<i>but again that's consistent
with the accounts.</i>

09:51.280 --> 09:53.636
<i>She was found in the wreckage
of the ag dome.</i>

09:53.720 --> 09:55.279
I'm not talking
about soybeans.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.079
I mean exotic biologicals.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.919
Anything that shouldn't be
on Ganymede.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.760
UN TECH: <i>Sir, I'm not sure
what you're getting at.</i>

10:00.840 --> 10:02.797
<i>We did a pretty
thorough analysis...</i>

10:02.880 --> 10:04.678
I don't want
"pretty thorough."

10:05.480 --> 10:08.518
I want you to go over every
goddamn molecule on that armor

10:08.840 --> 10:10.399
and tell me if there's
anything you've missed.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.470
Do you understand me?

10:11.840 --> 10:13.433
UN TECH: <i>Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.</i>

10:35.120 --> 10:36.918
NAOMI: Do you have any idea
where Dr. Strickland

10:37.000 --> 10:38.320
might have been going?

10:38.720 --> 10:39.915
Lucky for me,
I wasn't anywhere

10:40.000 --> 10:41.719
near the clinic when
the mirrors came down.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.433
I have no idea where
Dr. Strickland is.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.870
Have you seen
any patients with

10:46.600 --> 10:50.310
any kind of bluish mottling or
unusual, heavy skin growths?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.874
The growths might have
been glowing.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.916
From what?

10:57.480 --> 10:59.631
Radiation exposure,
possibly.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.679
I haven't seen anything
like that.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.230
What is it?

11:03.520 --> 11:05.000
Something we heard about.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.640
It's probably just a story.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.156
Then do me a favor and
don't spread it around.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.239
People don't need anything
more to worry about.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.638
The battle took out three
of these domes

11:13.880 --> 11:15.473
but we managed to save two.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.191
We've got things moving in
the right direction now.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.760
We're going to rebuild
this place.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.591
This doesn't feel like Eros,
does it?

11:30.680 --> 11:32.433
Maybe it just hasn't
started yet.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.877
I haven't seen Strickland
around for a while.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.874
There's a lot of turnover
these days.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.155
Aid workers come in,
refugees go out.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.229
Location services
are real spotty.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.356
It's hard to keep track.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.790
Sorry.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.755
What do we do now?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.120
I'm not the guy
you should be asking.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.838
This yellowing indicates
a nitrogen imbalance.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.075
We have phage-resistance
bacteria

12:03.200 --> 12:05.157
in the hydroponic lines
to prevent that,

12:05.800 --> 12:07.280
which means that something
got in and killed

12:07.360 --> 12:08.589
the good bacteria.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.679
Which means the hydroponics
have been contaminated.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.190
Is that a hard fix?

12:13.280 --> 12:15.397
Under normal
circumstances, no.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.638
These are too far gone
to make it.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.000
Basia? God.
Is that you?

12:29.720 --> 12:30.915
- Prax?
- Yes, it's me.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.670
(GROANS)

12:33.520 --> 12:37.230
Coward! You goddamn coward...

12:38.560 --> 12:39.994
Our children are out there
somewhere

12:40.520 --> 12:42.159
scared and alone
and you just...

12:42.840 --> 12:44.035
And you just leave?

12:44.120 --> 12:45.156
You just... (GROANS)

12:45.400 --> 12:46.550
Are you done?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.235
It's got nothing to do
with you.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.680
He's helping me find Mei.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.670
I came back to look for her.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.720
Basia, have you seen Mei?

12:58.240 --> 13:00.436
He took Mei out of the clinic
before the mirrors fell.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.032
If Mei's still with him,
then maybe Katoa is, too.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.476
We...

13:06.680 --> 13:08.717
- We gotta go!
- Do you know where Strickland is?

13:08.920 --> 13:09.956
I don't know...

13:10.600 --> 13:11.750
Roma will know.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.640
(STAMMERS) We gotta...

13:13.720 --> 13:15.154
We gotta show this
whole thing to Roma.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.234
- We gotta go right now.
- Hold on, hold on. Who's Roma?

13:19.200 --> 13:20.316
He finds people.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.480
He's helping me. He's...

13:22.840 --> 13:23.990
He's helping all of us.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.435
You guys got things to trade.
Okay, that's good...

13:27.520 --> 13:29.432
Because Roma,
he doesn't take scrip.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.840
Only barter.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.071
(STAMMERS)
He likes chicken.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.799
Only...
Only canned chicken.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.030
That works the best.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.839
- Canned chicken.
- Wait. He works for food?

13:38.080 --> 13:39.070
BASIA: Yeah.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.156
You give him canned chicken,

13:40.240 --> 13:42.152
he gives you a video
from the security monitor.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.232
You give him more chicken,
he gives you more video.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.800
He said that he could
find Katoa,

13:46.720 --> 13:48.632
but I... I didn't have
enough chicken.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.274
Yeah, that sounds
like a scam.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.794
Does this Roma
provide results?

13:52.960 --> 13:55.270
Yeah! He's got a place
in the AWP Corridor.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.517
Level 2, Room 2K.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.636
Please,
I can take you there...

13:58.720 --> 14:00.951
No, no, no, stay, Basia.
Stay, rest.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.430
Rest.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.674
I'll talk to Roma
for the both of us.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.910
I promise.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.280
For Mei and Katoa.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.397
A friend
at the Martian Embassy

14:36.520 --> 14:37.715
managed to get me

14:37.800 --> 14:39.792
Sergeant Draper's
service record.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.315
Anything interesting?

14:45.480 --> 14:46.630
Not at all.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.670
She's an exemplary soldier
who does what she's told to.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.035
What's wrong with you?

14:52.160 --> 14:53.150
Hmm?

14:53.640 --> 14:54.756
Sit down.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.312
I think she did
see something on Ganymede.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.632
Something we're not supposed
to know about.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.800
And what is fueling
these thoughts?

15:12.440 --> 15:14.796
I believe that Ganymede was
a test of a new weapon

15:14.880 --> 15:17.270
that Jules-Pierre Mao
is developing for Mars.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.554
Based on technology
he unleashed on Eros.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.834
You've been
in contact with him.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.510
No.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.278
But I was aware
of his weapons research...

15:34.040 --> 15:35.360
Because I was working
with him.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.270
(CHUCKLES)

15:43.680 --> 15:45.114
You've known for a while.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.560
Ever since you had
Frank Degraaf killed.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.994
I know it makes
no difference,

15:50.080 --> 15:51.833
but I had no hand in that,
Chrisjen.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.195
But you covered it up.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.160
You protected Jules.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.515
You need to
understand that...

15:59.280 --> 16:01.920
It started out as
a conversation about peace.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.071
About the discovery
of this incredible

16:05.160 --> 16:07.675
protomolecule on Phoebe.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.430
This was a way to guarantee
the safety of Earth.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.749
At a terrible price.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.797
You're the one who taught me
that Earth must come first.

16:14.880 --> 16:15.870
And Eros?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.912
A hundred thousand souls.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.036
Did I teach you that?

16:19.120 --> 16:21.476
If I had known what was going
to happen on Eros,

16:21.560 --> 16:23.040
I would have stopped
the project

16:23.120 --> 16:25.237
and Jules-Pierre Mao along
with it and you know that!

16:25.320 --> 16:27.676
Eros nearly destroyed
this planet.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.155
You will have to answer
for your part in that.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.235
I know.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.270
And I will.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.115
But what we need
to do right now

16:39.200 --> 16:40.873
is keep the system
from burning down.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.314
This is everything
that I know about

16:44.440 --> 16:45.920
the protomolecule project.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.471
If Ganymede really
was a test, then this is...

with food left the station
after the battle

19:09.320 --> 19:12.597
to honor contracts instead
of feeding the people here.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.553
They've been eating
the plants to survive.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.639
These plants have
no nutritional value.

19:17.760 --> 19:18.955
They're air scrubbers

19:19.080 --> 19:20.753
that supplement
the station's system.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.877
Roma's place should
be somewhere around here.

the man to talk to.

You guarantee results?

20:53.800 --> 20:54.836
No.

much faith in your work.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.395

home about neither.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.474
Well, that part might
be true, yeah.

28:13.640 --> 28:14.630
(CHUCKLES)

28:17.840 --> 28:18.956
Go back the way you came

28:19.760 --> 28:21.479
until you see a drainage
tunnel on your right.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.190
Got it.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.836
What's your name?

28:26.040 --> 28:27.110
Bobbie.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.110
Nico.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.236
Here's what you do.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.394
Feet planted
in line with your shoulders.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.630
Back straight.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.633
Head down,
staring at your toes.

28:37.840 --> 28:38.956
Then...

28:40.040 --> 28:42.794
Raise your chin, slowly...

28:42.960 --> 28:43.950
Hmm-mmm.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.195
Millimeter at a time...

28:49.480 --> 28:51.551
Till your eyes are locked
on the horizon.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.470
Okay.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.236
In a couple of weeks,

28:56.320 --> 28:57.310
your brain will
forge the pathways.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.954
Your inner ear
will get the memo.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.997
Then you'll be no different
than an Earther.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.316
Thank you.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.236
Now you.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.680
(SOFTLY) Head down.
Okay.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.470
Millimeter...

29:55.400 --> 29:57.710
I would've stopped him
before it went too far.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.153
Every shitty thing we do makes
the next one that much easier,

30:04.280 --> 30:05.270
doesn't it?

30:17.240 --> 30:19.038
You said you weren't
a homicidal maniac.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.150
I didn't kill him.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.436
Not yet.

30:27.840 --> 30:28.910
He's a bully.

30:30.040 --> 30:30.996
And where I come from,

30:31.080 --> 30:33.390
bullies take desperate young
girls like your daughter

30:33.600 --> 30:35.193
and force them
into prostitution.

30:36.240 --> 30:37.913
And when they finally
get knocked up,

30:38.640 --> 30:40.757
they peddle them to johns
who get off on that.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.760
After they have the kid,

30:44.080 --> 30:45.514
they push them right back out
on the streets

30:45.600 --> 30:47.319
even before they
have a chance to heal.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.112
And those kids...
They use them, too.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.831
Some people deserve
to be punished.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.112
When I learned the clinic
had been destroyed...

31:10.280 --> 31:12.158
When I had to accept
that Mei was dead...

31:14.080 --> 31:15.480
There was a part of me that...

31:18.200 --> 31:19.839
I felt almost relieved.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.200
She was sick her whole life.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.600
I couldn't fix her.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.519
I'm better with plants.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.790
I couldn't help her the way
a father is supposed to.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.157
Are you asking me
to tell you that's okay?

31:38.720 --> 31:39.836
I know it's not.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.313

32:25.520 --> 32:26.636
What are you doing?

32:27.120 --> 32:28.600
PRAX: Something I actually
know how to do.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.551
Did you notice the <i>Epipremnum
patatas</i> on the green wall?

32:32.920 --> 32:34.354
I'm sure that I did not.

32:34.760 --> 32:35.796
Right here.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.555
Pitchfork-shaped leaves
on the vine.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.674
Same yellowing as before.

32:44.360 --> 32:45.589
If you say so.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.360
They're using distilled water
in the hydroponic supply

32:49.440 --> 32:51.033
instead of the proper mineral
solutions needed

32:51.120 --> 32:52.236
for long-term stability.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.920
AMOS: That sounds bad.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.110
They'll only be able
to get away with it

32:58.200 --> 32:59.429
for another week, maybe two.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.989
After that, the air,
the scrubbing plants,

33:02.080 --> 33:04.072
what's left of them,
will die off.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.235
When that happens,
they won't be able

33:06.320 --> 33:07.310
to stop the cascade.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.909
What's the cascade?

33:10.800 --> 33:12.029
In real nature,

33:12.320 --> 33:14.551
there's enough diversity
to cushion an ecosystem

33:14.920 --> 33:16.513
when something
catastrophic happens.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.796
Nothing that we build,
our ships, our stations,

33:19.880 --> 33:20.870
has that depth.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.073
Now in an
artificial ecosystem,

33:23.200 --> 33:25.271
when one thing goes wrong,
there's only a certain amount

33:25.360 --> 33:27.079
of pathways that
can compensate for it.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.839
Eventually those pathways
get overstressed,

33:29.920 --> 33:31.115
and then they fail.

33:31.600 --> 33:32.920
Which leaves fewer pathways,

33:34.280 --> 33:35.919
and then they'll get
overstressed

33:36.200 --> 33:37.429
and then they fail.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.194
So it's not the thing
that breaks you

33:39.280 --> 33:40.600
that you need
to watch out for.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.869
Exactly.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.315
And Ganymede is
a simple complex system.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.232
Because it's simple,
it's prone to cascades,

33:49.320 --> 33:50.674
and because it's complex,

33:50.960 --> 33:53.191
you can't predict what's going
to break down next

33:53.280 --> 33:54.350
or how.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.710
Yeah, but Ganymede
is the most important

33:55.800 --> 33:56.836
food station out here.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.513
They're not going
to let it just collapse.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.794
This station is dead already.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.549
They just don't know it yet.
