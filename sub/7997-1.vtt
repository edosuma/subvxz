00:51.818 --> 00:53.911
Well, I wake up in the mornin'

00:54.020 --> 00:56.784
Each and everyday

00:56.856 --> 01:01.623
And I sit down at the table
and I hear my daddy say

01:01.694 --> 01:04.162
Life is nothin'
It's a nothin'

01:04.230 --> 01:06.721
Life is nothin'
but a slap in the face

01:06.799 --> 01:09.165
Life is nothin'
It's a nothin'

01:09.235 --> 01:11.897
Life is nothin'
but a fat rat race

01:11.971 --> 01:16.408
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

01:16.476 --> 01:18.967
Oh, yeah, yeah

01:19.045 --> 01:21.980
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:22.048 --> 01:24.039
Every night I have a dream

01:24.150 --> 01:26.983
That you're takin' off your dress

01:27.053 --> 01:31.717
The only thing you're wearin'
is a button on your chest

01:31.791 --> 01:34.191
And the button
it says nothin'

01:34.260 --> 01:36.854
Life is nothin'
but a slap in the face

01:36.929 --> 01:39.227
Life is nothin'
It's a nothin'

01:39.298 --> 01:41.766
Life is nothin'
but a fat rat race

01:41.834 --> 01:46.567
What is life

01:46.639 --> 01:49.199
What is life

01:49.275 --> 01:51.709
A rat race, a rat race

01:51.777 --> 01:56.544
What is life

01:56.649 --> 01:59.243
What is life

01:59.352 --> 02:01.843
A rat race, a rat race

02:01.954 --> 02:04.616
A rat race, a rat-rat race

02:04.690 --> 02:08.955
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

02:09.027 --> 02:12.054
Oh, yeah, yeah

02:12.131 --> 02:15.259
It's a jungle out there
and I know I don't belong

02:17.036 --> 02:20.403
So all night long
I just sing my stupid song

02:22.275 --> 02:24.470
Get a body out
in the rat, in the race

02:24.544 --> 02:27.012
Get a body out
in the rat, in the race

02:27.079 --> 02:29.639
Get a body out in the rat

02:33.819 --> 02:37.255
To the sound of the storm comin'
strictly from the B-A-H-A M-E-N

02:49.669 --> 02:52.137
Life ain't nothin'
but a big rat race

02:54.640 --> 02:56.835
Life ain't nothin'
but a big rat race

02:56.909 --> 02:59.139
Life is nothin'
It's a nothin'

02:59.212 --> 03:01.772
Life is nothin'
but a slap in the face

03:01.847 --> 03:04.145
Life is nothin'
It's a nothin'

03:04.250 --> 03:06.718
Life is nothin'
but a fat rat race

03:17.863 --> 03:21.867
Hi. I'm checking out. 14322.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.763
- Mr. Schaffer?
- That's me.

03:27.039 --> 03:30.031
- I have your bill right here.
- Great. Thank you.

03:30.109 --> 03:34.637
- How was your luck last night?
- I don't-- I didn't gamble.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.650
I was here for a friend's bachelor
party. I guess he's the gambler.

03:41.187 --> 03:44.748
What's this $110?

03:44.857 --> 03:49.260
- Those are your in-room movies.
- I didn't watch any movies.

03:49.328 --> 03:53.230
Okay, let's see. Afro Whores.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.460
Afro Whores?

03:55.534 --> 03:58.833
You watched it--
let's see-- 11 times.

04:01.007 --> 04:05.774
Afro Whores, 2:30. Afro Whores,
4:00. Afro Whores, 5:30.

04:05.845 --> 04:09.281
It says in the morning you watched
The Grinch for ten minutes...

04:09.348 --> 04:11.316
and then switched back
over to Afro Whores.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.386
I swear I didn't watch it.
I was at a bachelor party.

04:14.453 --> 04:16.683
There were 35 people there.
You can ask any of them.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.589
- Take that off my record.
- This is not a record, sir.

04:19.659 --> 04:24.119
- It's a delete.
- How many times did you watch it?

04:24.196 --> 04:27.131
None! I didn't watch it.

04:27.199 --> 04:31.192
Are you sure? "Sizzling,
three-way, backdoor action...

04:31.270 --> 04:33.636
featuring
two sexy soul sisters--"

04:33.706 --> 04:36.504
I don't need to know what
it's about. I did not watch it.

04:38.077 --> 04:41.308
I didn't.

04:41.380 --> 04:45.908
Drove 500, and Chipper Jones
struck out in that key situation.

04:46.018 --> 04:49.954
He's 0 for 5,
lost three straight games.

04:50.022 --> 04:54.152
This month he has
a one-game winning streak.

04:56.896 --> 05:01.856
Miss? Miss, can I have
another one of these, please?

05:01.934 --> 05:05.870
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were a woman.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.168
I am a woman.

05:10.042 --> 05:12.374
You know, you look
kind of familiar.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.970
Yeah, you do.

05:16.048 --> 05:18.039
You know, I get that
all the time.

05:18.150 --> 05:20.550
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

05:20.619 --> 05:24.214
And now for our loser of the week.
This week it's a no-brainer.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.791
Referee Owen Templeton made
the biggest bonehead call...

05:26.892 --> 05:28.826
in the history of football.

05:28.894 --> 05:33.263
It happened last Sunday at Dallas
with the score tied at 10.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.562
They were headed towards overtime.
Everything was cool.

05:35.634 --> 05:37.727
They were about to toss the coin
to see who would kick off.

05:37.803 --> 05:41.364
- Dallas, call it in the air.
- Tails.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.034
- That's heads.
- That was tails.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.237
- No. It's--
- That was tails.

05:46.312 --> 05:49.645
No-- Wait! Hang on!
It's-- Now, what did I say?

05:49.715 --> 05:51.683
- Tails!
- It's tails.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.720
- It's heads.
- What are you doin'?

05:56.789 --> 05:59.587
You saw--

05:59.658 --> 06:02.422
Okay, little brother,
just be cool.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.429
Just be cool.

06:18.043 --> 06:21.410
Okay, this is it.
See that glass?

06:21.480 --> 06:25.041
Walk across the lobby, slip on
the glass, let gravity do the rest.

06:26.051 --> 06:27.985
I might "eak" my neck.

06:28.053 --> 06:32.080
True. You could break your neck.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

06:32.191 --> 06:35.126
Why don't "oo" do it?

06:35.194 --> 06:38.220
Because, Einstein, one of us
needs to be the victim...

06:38.297 --> 06:41.130
and one of us needs
to be the witness.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.567
I'm your own brother.
I don't know what you're sayin'.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.764
How's your tongue?
Let me see it.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.573
How's it look?

06:53.279 --> 06:57.409
It looks good.
It looks much better.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.850
Okay, here we go.

06:59.919 --> 07:04.288
We're on Candid Camera,
so make it look good.

07:15.534 --> 07:18.002
Excuse me. I'm a lawyer.
Gloria Allred.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.800
- What the hell happened here?
- She slipped on that glass.

07:20.873 --> 07:25.207
Those arrogant jerks. They're gonna
pay for this through the nose.

07:25.277 --> 07:27.973
How's your neck?
I've never seen such negligence.

07:28.047 --> 07:29.981
This is going to be huge.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.949
She's an angel.

07:32.051 --> 07:35.487
What a cute little face.
Would you look at those cheeks?

07:35.588 --> 07:38.352
- She's absolutely beautiful.
- She has your eyes.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.585
It's the only picture
I have of her.

07:40.659 --> 07:42.593
It's all worn out 'cause
I'm always looking at it.

07:42.661 --> 07:46.495
- You haven't seen her for 27 years?
- Not till today.

07:46.565 --> 07:49.625
-She just called you out of the blue?
-No, I found her.

07:49.702 --> 07:54.401
I hired a detective. I spent all
my money. Now we're going to meet.

07:54.473 --> 07:57.465
- You think she'll recognize me?
- Of course she will, won't she?

07:57.543 --> 07:59.477
- Yeah.
- She will.

08:20.466 --> 08:22.400
Vera Baker.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.403
My baby--

08:29.141 --> 08:32.337
Excuse me.
I have to take this.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.902
This is Merrill.

08:37.249 --> 08:39.308
No! That's unacceptable!

08:39.418 --> 08:43.217
If we don't ship by Tuesday, we won't
be in the stores by Mother's Day.

08:43.289 --> 08:46.224
That's unacceptable, so don't
give me any excuses, and do it!

08:46.292 --> 08:49.090
Do it!
Just shut up and get it done!

08:51.764 --> 08:55.200
Oh, honey,
you broke your phone.

08:55.267 --> 08:59.363
It's okay. I carry extras.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.971
- Why don't we sit down?
- Yes.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.385
You probably have
a thousand questions for me.

09:17.790 --> 09:21.419
I was young. I didn't tell
anybody I was pregnant.

09:21.493 --> 09:25.122
And I felt I could handle it
at the time.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.995
Hi. Do you think
you gals could...

09:28.067 --> 09:30.092
pull yourselves together
and bring us a drink?

09:30.169 --> 09:32.194
- Yeah.
- Sure.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.262
Sure. What would you like?

09:34.340 --> 09:36.604
Mimosa.

09:36.675 --> 09:40.611
They both want a mimosa.

09:40.679 --> 09:44.376
So, you sell cosmetics?

09:44.483 --> 09:48.112
Yeah. I have my own company.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.085
And we're going public.

09:51.156 --> 09:54.250
And you're not married?

09:54.326 --> 09:57.762
- Lucianne said you wouldn't.
- Who?

09:57.830 --> 10:01.061
She's my psychic. She's the one
who told me to come look for you.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.101
She said you needed me.

10:03.168 --> 10:06.831
- She did?
- She said you were lonely...

10:06.905 --> 10:11.501
and you were worried about money
and you had trouble sleeping.

10:14.413 --> 10:18.679
Who the hell isn't?

10:24.890 --> 10:26.858
See? I told you
we didn't need a bellman.

10:26.925 --> 10:30.622
Yeah, well, congratulations, Randy.
You avoided another tip.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.755
Those nickels and dimes
add up, my dear.

10:32.831 --> 10:34.890
- I call this bed!
- Hey, no fair.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.231
- You got to pick last night.
- Go to hell, Jason.

10:37.302 --> 10:39.236
- Make me.
- Hey, language, please.

10:39.304 --> 10:41.465
- Bev, his and her bathrobes.
- Yes.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.508
- Look at that view.
- Yeah.

10:43.575 --> 10:48.478
- Nice view.
- Okay, honey. Why don't you unpack?

10:48.547 --> 10:51.209
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna go look around.

10:51.316 --> 10:55.047
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not going to the casino?

10:55.154 --> 10:58.555
No, no, of course not.

10:58.624 --> 11:02.424
I just drove from the Grand Canyon.
Gotta stretch my legs.

11:02.494 --> 11:06.021
You swore to me on your mother's eyes
we are here to see David Copperfield.

11:06.098 --> 11:09.768
- No gambling.
- I'm just lookin' around.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.237
In fact, I'm gonna go
to the gift shop.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.365
I can jump farther than you.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.910
- I can jump farther.
- No way. Watch.

11:21.547 --> 11:25.142
That's gotta hurt.
Honey, kids need ya.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.582
- Hey, Nick. Nicky!
- Hey.

11:27.653 --> 11:29.951
- You're not leaving?
- I'm in court on Tuesday.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.458
- No, you're not.
- I work for people who are.

11:33.525 --> 11:36.323
You pussy. You can't leave.
It's still goin' on up there.

11:36.395 --> 11:38.761
Richie, I have to.
I've had two hours sleep.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.732
Steve Cunningham just got another
stripper. You got to see this one.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.734
- She's incredible.
- I got to get back.

11:43.802 --> 11:46.999
No, you don't, Nick.
I know you. You're scared.

11:47.072 --> 11:50.041
You're scared it's gonna
get out of control up there.

11:50.109 --> 11:52.509
Someday you'll be up for attorney
general and it'll haunt you.

11:52.578 --> 11:55.706
- I'm not having this conversation.
- You didn't even gamble.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.045
Not one quarter.
That's no way to live.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.176
In fact, that ain't even livin'.
It's hiding.

12:01.286 --> 12:03.914
- I'm not hiding from anything.
- Oh, no?

12:04.022 --> 12:06.490
Okay, then prove it.

12:06.592 --> 12:09.356
Do something, anything.
Break one rule.

12:09.428 --> 12:14.365
Here. Look. Nick, a paper.
Come on. Take it.

12:14.433 --> 12:18.096
Take it. Come on, Nick.
Take it.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.469
I have a plane to catch, okay?

12:24.543 --> 12:27.137
I'll see you in Chicago.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.409
Oh, look, I won! I won!

12:31.517 --> 12:33.542
Look at the money comin' down.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.815
Look. Look, look, look.
What's-- What's--

12:36.889 --> 12:40.985
"You're a winner.
See guest services."

12:42.661 --> 12:45.391
What? A dollar?

12:49.635 --> 12:51.569
Come on, baby. Come on!

13:08.187 --> 13:09.119
Come on.

13:10.556 --> 13:11.818
We won!

13:14.059 --> 13:19.258
- We won one.
- What is this? This isn't money.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.778
That's the prize?
A free buffet?

13:39.885 --> 13:41.944
Actually, it's not a buffet.

13:42.054 --> 13:45.649
It's a special reception at 10:00
in the penthouse conference room.

13:45.724 --> 13:48.318
"Where a spectacular...

13:48.393 --> 13:51.556
once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity awaits you."

13:51.630 --> 13:53.564
That's all I know.

13:53.632 --> 13:56.396
- What do you think?
- I think it's some kind of scam.

13:56.468 --> 13:59.028
Good! A scam! We'll do it.

13:59.104 --> 14:02.073
- I'll need to see some I.D.
- Okay.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.313
There. I gambled.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.297
Family vacation? These are
the moments you got to savor, right?

14:25.297 --> 14:27.822
Family vacation? These are
the moments you got to savor, right?

14:27.900 --> 14:30.528
- They'll never come around again.
- Exactly.

14:30.602 --> 14:33.196
Excuse me.
Do you know what's going on?

14:33.272 --> 14:35.206
Free grub.
That's what's going on.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.742
This room is fabulous.

14:37.809 --> 14:41.108
- Does anybody know why we're here?
- Beats me.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.148
Oh, my God.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.241
You should sue somebody.

14:46.351 --> 14:47.841
I did it myself.

14:47.953 --> 14:51.389
- What?
- He did it himself from a kit.

14:51.456 --> 14:56.723
I knew I recognized you.
You're the referee-- the bonehead.

14:56.795 --> 15:00.390
That's just the media
blowing it out of proportion.

15:00.465 --> 15:04.731
My hairdresser's husband
lost $800 because of you.

15:04.803 --> 15:07.328
- Everybody thinks we flip quarters.
- Can I have a picture with you?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.465
It's really
a commemorative coin. Look.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.475
- Smile.
- Please. You--

15:13.545 --> 15:18.039
Am I too late?
Look. I won a coin.

15:18.150 --> 15:23.383
A gold coin.
Isn't this wonderful?

15:23.455 --> 15:25.650
Look at this room.

15:25.724 --> 15:30.889
What a beautiful room.
Have you seen this room?

15:30.963 --> 15:33.955
Yes! We're in it.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.226
I am Enrico Pollini.

15:39.304 --> 15:43.604
Now, I know what you are thinking.
Enrico is a girl's name.

15:43.675 --> 15:46.439
- No, I wasn't.
- No pun intended.

15:46.511 --> 15:51.244
- What pun is that?
- Food. Look at all this food.

15:51.350 --> 15:57.186
What a beautiful party.
Little cockdoggies.

15:57.255 --> 15:58.916
They're called
cocktail wienies.

15:58.991 --> 16:03.860
Wienies. I'm so sorry.
My English is not so good.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.693
But I'm learning.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.233
That's it. Vera.
We're outta here.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.633
-I want to say good-bye. Bye, y'all.
-Excuse me.

16:11.703 --> 16:16.572
Thank you all for coming. I'm
Donald Sinclair. I own this hotel.

16:16.641 --> 16:18.802
We don't have much time.

16:18.877 --> 16:24.543
There's a meteor the size of North
Carolina heading straight for Earth.

16:24.649 --> 16:29.916
The impact is going to kill every
thing and everyone on this planet.

16:29.988 --> 16:34.823
I built a bunker in the basement
strong enough to withstand the blast.

16:34.893 --> 16:37.953
There's room for eight people. I have
chosen the seven of you, plus me.

16:38.030 --> 16:43.730
When this is over, we will repopulate
and re-civilize the planet.

16:52.744 --> 16:57.044
I couldn't resist! I'm sorry.

17:00.585 --> 17:03.213
A joke. He made a joke.

17:03.321 --> 17:07.690
Do sit down, please. Merrill, you
and your mother can sit over here.

17:07.759 --> 17:11.422
- How do you know she's my mother?
- Alas, there are no secrets anymore.

17:11.496 --> 17:15.762
Actually, that's not quite true.
There is one secret, one last secret.

17:15.834 --> 17:20.328
It involves all of you.

17:21.807 --> 17:25.265
- I'm getting goose pimples.
- Hey--

17:26.310 --> 17:28.108
Ah, Mr. Schaffer!

17:28.180 --> 17:31.877
Curiosity got the better
of you, eh? Come and sit down.

17:31.983 --> 17:35.885
- I'm fine. Thanks.
- You haven't missed anything.

17:35.954 --> 17:37.922
We were just
cutting to the chase.

17:37.989 --> 17:40.753
Cutting to the chase.

17:44.162 --> 17:46.255
Well, you'll laugh later.

17:46.331 --> 17:50.097
Now, as you know, the odds against
winning a jackpot downstairs...

17:50.168 --> 17:53.467
or hitting the state lottery
are astronomical-- millions to one.

17:53.538 --> 17:57.235
A serious person doesn't
even bother, but today...

17:57.309 --> 18:00.710
you have the chance
of playing a game...

18:00.779 --> 18:03.646
where the odds of winning
are one in six.

18:03.748 --> 18:06.581
One in six.

18:07.819 --> 18:09.218
It's one throw...

18:11.690 --> 18:13.715
of the dice.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.195
This is my attorney,
Mr. Grisham...

18:20.265 --> 18:23.632
who tragically was born
without a personality.

18:23.702 --> 18:28.105
Mr. Grisham insists anyone who wishes
to participate in our experiment...

18:28.173 --> 18:33.110
sign this waiver, absolving the casino
from responsibility or damages...

18:33.178 --> 18:36.978
personal liability,
blah, blah, blah.

18:37.082 --> 18:40.483
So, who do you like, Claude?

18:40.552 --> 18:43.521
The young woman in the black coat.
She looks desperate.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.056
Yes, but she has
her mother with her.

18:46.124 --> 18:49.821
- That could slow her down, hmm?
- Perhaps.

18:49.895 --> 18:53.331
Now, 563 miles from here...

18:53.398 --> 18:56.492
is a little town called
Silver City, New Mexico.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.832
- Gold rush.
- Quite right, Nick.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.270
Yes, they struck gold there
in 1860.

19:01.339 --> 19:04.075
It was the second largest
gold rush in American history.

19:04.209 --> 19:08.737
Very good, Nick. I think
Nick should be our captain.

19:11.650 --> 19:15.313
In downtown Silver City,
there's a train station.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.116
As you go in the front door,
there's some lockers on the right.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.623
Mr. Grisham,
do you have the keys?

19:21.693 --> 19:23.661
Six identical keys.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.861
They all open the same locker.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.799
That's locker 001.

19:29.868 --> 19:33.565
Inside the locker is a red duffel
bag. Inside the red duffel bag...

19:33.638 --> 19:35.936
is $2 million.

19:36.007 --> 19:40.808
In cash, fifties and hundreds,
makes a pile about so big.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.905
First one there keeps it all.

19:45.584 --> 19:50.283
I put transmitting devices in
your key rings to keep track of you.

19:50.388 --> 19:54.415
And that's it.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.458
Go.

19:58.163 --> 20:00.495
You just can't pick people
at random.

20:00.565 --> 20:02.931
I can do anything I like, Owen.
I'm eccentric.

20:04.569 --> 20:05.501
Go!

20:05.570 --> 20:08.300
Wait, wait.
So, it's like a race?

20:09.474 --> 20:11.704
A race. It's a race.

20:11.776 --> 20:13.869
I hope I win.

20:13.945 --> 20:16.243
What are the rules?

20:16.314 --> 20:20.045
There's only one rule.
Are you ready? Here it is.

20:20.819 --> 20:24.186
There are no rules.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.190
Go.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.460
Go!

20:29.561 --> 20:33.895
So now when you say, "Go,"
you mean just go?

20:33.965 --> 20:37.423
Begin, commence, start moving.

20:37.502 --> 20:41.438
Theoretically, you have been
racing for about 40 seconds.

20:41.506 --> 20:44.031
So far, Mr. Schaffer is winning...

20:44.109 --> 20:47.044
because he's nearest to the door.

20:54.953 --> 20:56.682
You're crazy!

20:56.788 --> 21:00.781
A race! A race!
You have to pace yourself.

21:00.892 --> 21:04.828
Carbohydrate is important.
Pasta is good.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.524
Breathing is important.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.458
Scusi. One--

21:13.338 --> 21:16.205
It's some sort of joke.
It has to be.

21:16.274 --> 21:19.607
What kind of jackass
just gives away $2 million?

21:19.678 --> 21:22.203
Maybe it's a publicity stunt.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.579
What kind of publicity?
He swore us all to secrecy.

21:25.650 --> 21:30.451
-Maybe it's a secret publicity stunt.
-A secret publicity stunt?

21:30.555 --> 21:31.988
Yes!

21:32.057 --> 21:34.082
I don't know what his angle is,
but there's always an angle.

21:34.192 --> 21:37.252
Donald Sinclair-- People like him
make millions of dollars...

21:37.329 --> 21:40.059
playing people
like us for chumps.

21:40.131 --> 21:42.326
- I'm nobody's chump.
- So you don't believe--

21:42.400 --> 21:46.234
11:30, nonstop to Chicago.
I'm gonna be on it.

21:46.971 --> 21:49.166
You know what? He's right.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.731
I'm not cuttin' short
my first family vacation...

21:51.810 --> 21:54.335
in three years to go on
some half-assed wild goose chase.

21:54.412 --> 21:58.109
Okay, so,
you're not goin' for it?

22:00.218 --> 22:01.879
I don't think so.

22:01.986 --> 22:04.580
- Not me, no.
- No. Great.

22:04.689 --> 22:07.123
- I guess that's that, huh?
- Right.

22:07.192 --> 22:09.888
It was nice meetin' y'all.
I'm gonna take the stairs.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.930
My room's just two floors down,
so nice meetin' ya.

22:12.997 --> 22:15.227
Hey, have a nice vacation.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.699
You know, it's probably stuck.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.813
I think I'm gonna
take the stairs too.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.350
Crap.

22:41.459 --> 22:43.825
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on, Vera!

22:48.566 --> 22:51.160
Watch out!

22:52.404 --> 22:54.565
Comin' through!

22:59.344 --> 23:01.039
Hold the door, please.

23:01.112 --> 23:03.876
Take your time. No rush.

23:03.948 --> 23:05.939
- Get up!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

23:06.017 --> 23:10.681
If we're all gonna go for it,
why don't we go for it together?

23:10.789 --> 23:13.781
You know, split the money 50-50.

23:13.892 --> 23:17.692
- Fifty-fifty?
- You know what I mean. Whatever.

23:17.762 --> 23:19.696
Yes, yes, that's a good plan.

23:19.764 --> 23:22.858
It's a race. It's a race.

23:22.934 --> 23:26.062
I'm winning. I'm winning.

23:29.307 --> 23:31.070
And they're off!

23:32.277 --> 23:37.340
No one-- No one is offering you
action like this.

23:37.415 --> 23:40.578
A horse race with animals
that can think and plan...

23:40.685 --> 23:45.520
and lie and cheat
and play dirty.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.855
It's the gambling experience
of a lifetime.

23:48.927 --> 23:53.227
It's my way of saying
I understand men like you.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.129
I know what you want.
I know what you need.

23:55.200 --> 24:00.103
This casino-- my casino--
is where you belong.

24:02.373 --> 24:04.807
- I got it!
- Excuse me!

24:04.876 --> 24:07.242
- To the airport.
- You got it.

24:07.312 --> 24:09.940
We're out the door.
I don't see you. Where are you?

24:09.981 --> 24:14.384
- I forgot to tip the maid.
- Forget the maid. There he is!

24:14.486 --> 24:16.886
- Come on! Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

24:17.956 --> 24:22.222
Bev, this is a real job!
I swear!

24:23.628 --> 24:24.959
What is it?

24:27.131 --> 24:29.156
The job? What's the job?

24:31.336 --> 24:33.736
Ink for fountain pens.

24:36.174 --> 24:39.143
- And they're in New Mexico?
- Silver City, New Mexico.

24:39.210 --> 24:42.941
I love New Mexico.
Honey, we'll go with you.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.744
- No!
- Why not?

24:46.651 --> 24:50.747
Because we've already paid for the
room. Now look who's wasting money.

24:51.856 --> 24:53.824
This was your idea to stop here.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.861
I don't care about David Copperfield.
We're on vacation. We'll go with you.

24:56.928 --> 25:00.420
- But you don't understand--
- We will go with you!

25:03.835 --> 25:04.859
- Fine.
- Yes!

25:04.936 --> 25:07.871
Fine. Fine. Here. Call the bellman.
Have him bring the van around.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.032
- You happy? You happy?
- Okay.

25:10.108 --> 25:14.568
Scusi. Scusi.
I'm in a race. Scusi.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.376
Scusi. It's a race.

25:31.596 --> 25:35.123
- What is he doing?
- I think he's sleeping.

25:35.199 --> 25:37.167
- Sleeping?
- He must be narcoleptic.

25:37.235 --> 25:39.169
It's a rare sleeping disorder.

25:39.237 --> 25:42.604
- But I bet on him!
- So did I. Two million dollars.

25:42.674 --> 25:45.199
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
All the bets are locked in.

25:45.276 --> 25:47.244
Sleeping! Sleeping!

25:55.753 --> 25:57.812
- Look out!
- Don't tell me how to drive!

25:57.922 --> 25:59.514
It's only yellow.
It's only yellow. Run it!

26:01.593 --> 26:05.256
- Where's my video game?
- Seat belts, everyone.

26:05.330 --> 26:09.733
- Honey, what is the rush?
- It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

26:09.801 --> 26:12.565
You're not just a travel agent,
Roger. You're an angel.

26:12.637 --> 26:15.231
There's one charter plane
available in Las Vegas.

26:15.306 --> 26:17.274
We just bagged it.

26:17.342 --> 26:19.276
- Back to pass.
- Get rid of it.

26:19.344 --> 26:22.836
- Looks to his left.
- Get rid of it. Throw the ball!

26:22.914 --> 26:25.405
That's why you're not
gonna get drafted!

26:25.483 --> 26:28.509
You'll be lucky to play
arena football in Barcelona!

26:28.620 --> 26:31.453
- You like football?
- Sure.

26:31.522 --> 26:35.515
Did you happen to catch
that Dallas game last week?

26:35.627 --> 26:40.690
It was an obscenity.
It was a crime against football.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.495
I lost 20 grand on that game!
And they would have won!

26:43.568 --> 26:47.026
Now I gotta work two shifts
because of that idiot!

26:47.105 --> 26:51.269
Stevie Wonder could have done
a better job calling that game.

26:53.478 --> 26:55.412
Where the hell's the airport?

26:57.382 --> 27:00.977
One flip of the coin and the franchise
goes straight down the crapper.

27:01.085 --> 27:03.178
- That'll be 10.50, buddy.
- Keep the change.

27:04.322 --> 27:07.849
Thanks a lot.
You have a nice flight. Yeah!

27:07.959 --> 27:10.086
You know who that was?

27:10.161 --> 27:14.188
That was the ref. The guy
from the game? The coin toss!

27:14.265 --> 27:17.200
Oh, my God!
You're right! That was him!

27:17.268 --> 27:19.537
I had him in the cab,
and I let him go!

27:19.671 --> 27:22.333
- Where are we going?
- We gotta go. Come on. Just go.

27:22.407 --> 27:25.638
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Chumps.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.163
Excuse me. Hi.

27:53.905 --> 27:57.341
- I'm not a creep or anything.
- I don't have any quarters.

27:59.677 --> 28:02.942
I never do this, but I'm
reading the same book you are.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.141
Look. See? Lindbergh.

28:05.216 --> 28:07.150
It's fantastic, isn't it?

28:07.218 --> 28:11.052
- What part are you on?
- He just had a sex change.

28:11.122 --> 28:13.215
Who did? Lindbergh?

28:13.291 --> 28:15.725
- Sex change?
- Yeah.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.126
That's funny.

28:21.232 --> 28:23.029
- I thought so.
- That's funny.

28:23.101 --> 28:25.035
I wouldn't be too proud
of yourself though.

28:25.103 --> 28:27.037
I'm the most gullible guy
in Chicago.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.133
Can I buy you a drink?

28:33.144 --> 28:34.702
I can't. I'm flying.

28:34.779 --> 28:39.842
- So, it'll relax you.
- I mean, I'm flying. I'm a pilot.

28:43.254 --> 28:46.087
Pilot? Are there
a lot of female pilots?

28:47.158 --> 28:48.750
There's at least one.

28:51.963 --> 28:55.364
When I walk away, I'm gonna think
of something great to say to that.

28:55.433 --> 28:58.027
Good. Mail it to me.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.505
Flight 115 to
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

29:05.576 --> 29:08.602
- Gate 17. You better hurry.
- Four tickets to Albuquerque.

29:08.679 --> 29:11.477
-Near the front of the plane. Please.
-All right.

29:11.549 --> 29:13.483
Come on!

29:14.385 --> 29:17.513
This is so exciting. I've never
been on a private plane before.

29:17.588 --> 29:19.613
This is bigger than my condo.

29:19.690 --> 29:22.386
- Gentlemen, what's our ETA?
- One hour and ten minutes.

29:23.161 --> 29:25.652
If you can do it in less than
an hour, I'll buy you both dinner.

29:25.730 --> 29:27.391
You're on--

29:27.498 --> 29:30.490
- Watch it. Move. Excuse me. Move.
- Move! Move! Move!

29:30.601 --> 29:32.535
- Who was next?
- I was!

29:32.603 --> 29:33.865
- I was!
- I was!

29:33.938 --> 29:36.668
- What? You were not next!
- Are you callin' me a liar?

29:36.741 --> 29:40.438
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.
We've been in line over 20 minutes.

29:40.511 --> 29:43.878
- Is that the correct time?
- Hey! Whoa!

29:43.948 --> 29:46.143
Yes, it is.

29:47.151 --> 29:49.415
- Who's next?
- They were, right there.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.251
Two tickets to Albuquerque.

29:52.323 --> 29:56.692
I'm sorry. We're completely booked.
There's nothing.

29:56.761 --> 29:59.525
There's a 4:30,
but you have to switch in Dallas.

30:04.268 --> 30:09.069
What do you mean that's it? I'm
not givin' up and neither are you.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.837
And neither am I!
I'll tell you something, brother.

30:12.910 --> 30:16.846
If we're not flyin' outta here,
no one is flyin' outta here.

31:16.774 --> 31:18.207
That can't be good.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.177
Duane!

31:40.298 --> 31:41.765
No!

31:50.207 --> 31:52.732
Blaine! Blaine!

31:55.780 --> 31:59.443
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

32:05.823 --> 32:07.450
Shit!

32:18.336 --> 32:21.703
I can't!

32:21.772 --> 32:25.902
What are you doin'?
I don't know where to go!

32:25.977 --> 32:27.911
- Move!
- Trying to kill me?

32:27.979 --> 32:32.245
Duane, stop the car!
Stop the car!

32:43.327 --> 32:47.354
Whoa, girl! Jesus!

33:00.778 --> 33:04.179
Freeze everything, every flight.
Get me Central Operations.

33:06.450 --> 33:08.384
Attention all passengers.

33:08.452 --> 33:10.920
Due to a technical problem
with our radar tracking system...

33:10.988 --> 33:13.456
all flights are postponed
until further notice.

33:13.524 --> 33:16.721
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.227
We gotta go.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.592
- Hurry up!
- The bags?

33:20.698 --> 33:22.632
Forget the bags! Let's go!

33:22.700 --> 33:24.998
Comin' through!

33:26.070 --> 33:29.301
- This is your license?
- Yes, it is.

33:30.374 --> 33:32.308
- Where was it issued?
- In Guam.

33:36.247 --> 33:38.875
Just head east,
and I'm in a hurry.

33:39.750 --> 33:44.153
Hello again. East it is.

33:45.689 --> 33:48.749
We have a midsized Caprice.

33:48.826 --> 33:51.420
- What color is it?
- We don't care about color.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.123
Just give us whatever car
is parked closest to the door.

33:54.231 --> 33:56.722
Ask about insurance.

33:56.834 --> 34:00.133
Would you be interested
in purchasing liability insurance?

34:00.204 --> 34:02.798
- How much is it?
- It doesn't matter. We'll take it.

34:02.873 --> 34:04.864
Just hurry.

34:08.112 --> 34:11.239
Hit enter. Now shift.

34:12.315 --> 34:14.681
Shift key. Right there. Yeah.

34:18.422 --> 34:19.855
Hey, watch it!

34:19.924 --> 34:23.121
Bus! White people!

34:26.030 --> 34:26.928
ldiot!

34:28.032 --> 34:30.125
Okay, I've got one.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.533
- What?
- A great comeback.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.864
I said, "Are there
a lot of female pilots?"

34:37.942 --> 34:39.933
And you said,
"There's at least one."

34:40.010 --> 34:43.467
I should have said,
"Two if you count Lindbergh."

34:44.547 --> 34:46.539
'Cause you said
he had a sex change.

34:47.217 --> 34:49.152
It's a work in progress.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.552
- I'm Nick Schaffer.
- Tracy Faucet.

34:51.621 --> 34:53.612
So I guess you can have
that drink now.

34:53.690 --> 34:57.149
I told you I'm flying. I'm leaving
for Roswell in five minutes.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.492
Didn't you hear?
Everybody's grounded.

34:59.597 --> 35:03.693
That's for fixed wing. I'm in a
chopper. We use a different system.

35:09.974 --> 35:12.408
Roswell, New Mexico?

35:13.944 --> 35:17.209
- You're flying to New Mexico?
- We've been flying down all week.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.250
They're repainting
the whole fleet.

35:23.254 --> 35:27.554
You can fly.
Nobody else can fly.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.719
But you can fly.

35:30.794 --> 35:33.786
- And you're flying to New Mexico.
- Yeah.

35:33.864 --> 35:36.958
- But nobody else can fly.
- Yeah.

35:37.034 --> 35:40.299
Do you need a ride?

35:43.774 --> 35:46.299
Come on!

35:51.715 --> 35:54.513
- Coconut.
- Coconut! Who had coconut?

35:54.585 --> 35:57.383
I did.

35:57.454 --> 35:59.183
Phil.

36:00.758 --> 36:02.851
That's the kind of car
that I'm gettin'.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.691
- Yeah? Don't count on it.
- Why not?

36:05.763 --> 36:08.755
Because the Volkswagen Beetle
was used by the Nazis.

36:08.832 --> 36:12.097
I would not be comfortable
driving around in one.

36:12.169 --> 36:16.606
- So, don't drive it. I will.
- Dad, I have to go.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.166
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I really do.

36:20.277 --> 36:24.543
- We just stopped!
- The bathroom was too gross.

36:24.615 --> 36:28.711
- Well, can't you hold it in?
- I can't! It's an emergency.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.720
Honey, there's a restaurant.

36:30.788 --> 36:33.757
That's three miles down and
then back. We lose ten minutes.

36:33.824 --> 36:36.054
So what? Your daughter
has to go to the bathroom.

36:36.126 --> 36:38.526
- Please stop, Dad.
- All right.

36:38.596 --> 36:41.224
Jason, look back there
for an empty jar.

36:41.298 --> 36:43.357
A jar? Girls don't pee in jars.

36:43.434 --> 36:45.368
All right, sorry.

36:45.436 --> 36:49.099
Jason, we're gonna
need a jar and a funnel.

36:49.173 --> 36:51.767
Dad, I don't have to pee.
It's number two!

36:51.875 --> 36:56.312
- Sorry, I can't stop.
- Dad, I'm prairie-dogging it.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.779
What does that mean?

36:57.848 --> 37:01.545
Like when a prairie dog sticks
his head in and out of the ground.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.715
I do not want
to picture that.

37:09.793 --> 37:12.421
Yes, sir, Silver City it is.

37:12.496 --> 37:15.795
- Buddy.
- It's about 700 miles.

37:15.866 --> 37:20.235
- You don't mind, do ya?
- Oh, no. No, no, I don't mind.

37:20.304 --> 37:23.705
A job's just
another job for me.

37:23.774 --> 37:26.766
About how much you think
that's gonna cost?

37:26.877 --> 37:31.576
I wouldn't worry about it.
Tell you what.

37:31.649 --> 37:35.847
You just pay me
whatever you think is fair...

37:35.919 --> 37:40.754
'cause I trust your judgment.

37:40.824 --> 37:43.816
I hate you. I hate you!

37:43.894 --> 37:48.160
Nobody look. I'm gonna turn on
the radio, so nobody can hear you.

37:48.232 --> 37:50.166
I'll never forgive you.
I hate you.

37:50.234 --> 37:52.828
Nobody can hear you, honey.
Push away.

38:01.478 --> 38:04.538
I'm gonna drop you off there. There's
a parking lot near the hospital.

38:04.648 --> 38:08.140
- Great. Great.
- So what's wrong with her?

38:08.252 --> 38:11.153
-Who?
-Your sister. You said it's serious.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.055
Yeah. Shark bite.

38:17.127 --> 38:19.891
- A shark bite?
- Yeah.

38:19.963 --> 38:22.591
They took her to Silver City?

38:22.666 --> 38:26.033
They have a really good
shark attack unit there.

38:34.011 --> 38:35.945
How fast was I going?

38:43.554 --> 38:47.513
- Where are we?
- It's a shortcut I know.

38:47.591 --> 38:51.584
-Maybe we should stick to the highway.
-There's a thought.

38:51.662 --> 38:55.894
You say stick to the highway.
I say we should take my shortcut.

38:55.966 --> 39:00.665
- Why don't we just flip a coin?
- It's not what you think.

39:00.738 --> 39:04.037
- Come on, you blind son of a bitch!
- Wait! Stop it!

39:04.108 --> 39:07.839
Give me that goddamn whistle!
I'm gonna shove it up your ass!

39:07.945 --> 39:10.106
Come back here!

39:13.350 --> 39:16.148
Shit.

39:18.355 --> 39:20.880
I'll kill him.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.333
- Squirrel?
- No, thank you.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.845
We're looking for the interstate.

39:42.913 --> 39:46.371
I get that a lot
'cause of the detour.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.551
Now they've lost their way.

39:50.621 --> 39:54.785
Now they can't go home.
You sure you don't want one?

39:54.858 --> 39:56.553
We're sure. Thank you.

39:56.627 --> 40:00.290
They make crackerjack pets.
I taught this one to shake hands.

40:00.364 --> 40:04.460
He's not for sale though. Who wants
to go home with the nice ladies?

40:04.535 --> 40:07.834
"Pick me. Pick me.
Don't be afraid. I don't bite.

40:07.905 --> 40:12.274
- What's your name, pretty lady?"
- Vera.

40:12.342 --> 40:14.742
Ma'am, really.
We're not interested.

40:14.845 --> 40:17.871
Well, I'm not talkin' to you, am I?
I'm talkin' to Vera.

40:17.981 --> 40:22.418
What about Bucky here? He loves
to climb trees and eat nuts.

40:22.486 --> 40:24.579
Ma'am, we do not
want a squirrel.

40:24.655 --> 40:26.782
Do you or do you not know
where the interstate is?

40:26.857 --> 40:30.258
Of course I do. I'm not retarded.
"Tell 'em about the shortcut."

40:30.327 --> 40:32.693
Thank you, Bucky.

40:32.763 --> 40:36.199
I almost forgot.
There's a dandy shortcut.

40:36.266 --> 40:38.962
It'll bring you right to exit 14.
It'll save you 30 miles.

40:40.003 --> 40:42.096
Now listen carefully.

40:42.172 --> 40:45.630
You want to go straight
down here exactly 1.8 miles.

40:45.742 --> 40:50.008
- 1.8.
- Make a left at Totem Pole Ranch.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.844
Go 5.4 miles and
you're gonna go up a big hill.

40:52.916 --> 40:56.511
You'll see a big yellow sign
with some graffiti on it.

40:56.587 --> 41:01.149
Take the dirt road on the right.
It'll take you to the interstate.

41:01.225 --> 41:02.487
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:02.559 --> 41:06.928
Wait a minute.
Take some nuts with you...

41:06.997 --> 41:09.659
just in case
you see a squirrel, okay?

41:11.134 --> 41:15.571
"Bye. Bye.
You could have bought me."

41:15.639 --> 41:18.369
You'll make it. You'll make it.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.677
Where am I?

41:30.220 --> 41:33.348
Wow! A Barbie Museum!
Can we stop?

41:33.423 --> 41:37.757
Sorry, Kimmy. We have a plan,
and we're gonna stick to the plan.

41:37.828 --> 41:40.262
Please, Daddy. Please, please,
please, please, please.

41:40.330 --> 41:42.730
- Hey, hey!
- It's not fair.

41:42.799 --> 41:45.427
We never get to stop
anywhere I want to.

41:45.502 --> 41:48.733
I'm sure Jason doesn't want
to go to the Barbie Museum.

41:48.805 --> 41:52.241
You kiddin'? I'll stop anywhere.
I'm wiggin' out back here.

41:52.342 --> 41:55.937
You need to pull over and stop
to give the kids a break.

41:56.046 --> 41:57.911
Yeah, okay,
maybe on the way back.

41:57.981 --> 41:59.972
- Stop the car.
- I can't do that.

42:00.083 --> 42:02.051
- We all need to stop the car.
- No can do.

42:02.152 --> 42:04.518
- You need to stop the car.
- No!

42:04.588 --> 42:06.055
Stop the car!

42:12.763 --> 42:15.288
Okay, fine, but 10 minutes.

42:15.365 --> 42:18.698
Wow! The Barbie Museum.

42:19.770 --> 42:21.101
Klaus Barbie...

42:21.171 --> 42:23.469
sometimes known as
the Butcher of Lyons.

42:23.540 --> 42:27.567
Let the Jew revisionists
talk about their death camps...

42:27.678 --> 42:30.613
and so-called crimes
against humanity.

42:30.681 --> 42:36.085
This museum is lovingly dedicated to
the Klaus Barbie that nobody knows.

42:36.186 --> 42:39.952
The husband, the devoted father,
the wine connoisseur...

42:40.023 --> 42:42.958
and three-time
ballroom dancing champion.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.831
Hey, hey, there's that guy,
the "udgy" one.

42:55.172 --> 42:58.539
Barbie joined
the SS in 1935...

42:58.609 --> 43:02.443
where he soon became one of
the Fuhrer's favorite young officers.

43:02.512 --> 43:04.912
Can we go?

43:04.982 --> 43:08.179
Here we see him standing
beside Hitler's touring car...

43:08.251 --> 43:12.381
the very same car on display
outside in our courtyard.

43:12.456 --> 43:13.718
You're leaving?

43:15.292 --> 43:17.351
What--

43:17.427 --> 43:22.160
No-- Yes. Well, we have a 4:30
book burning, and then we have a--

43:22.232 --> 43:24.257
- A christening.
- Yes, a christening...

43:24.334 --> 43:28.361
for one of our many white,
Christian, non-Jewish friends--

43:28.472 --> 43:34.138
-Family. Blood relatives.
-The Himmler Hessin Von Sturichberg--

43:34.211 --> 43:36.679
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, love your do.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.771
Thank you. It's beautiful.
We had a great time.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.778
Wow! A gift shop.

43:41.852 --> 43:45.151
Yes, I know, honey. Next time.
I promise. I really do.

43:45.222 --> 43:47.213
Just go. Just go.

43:47.290 --> 43:51.989
- Oh, my God! We've been cut!
- What do we do now?

43:53.063 --> 43:54.530
I say we take
the interstate.

43:54.598 --> 43:58.125
No, "ake" Highway "well."
That's a shortcut.

43:58.201 --> 44:01.898
You don't know what the shortcut
is. It could be a dirt road.

44:02.005 --> 44:05.907
You know what? There are
"oo" of us. Why don't we separate?

44:05.976 --> 44:08.945
- What?
- There's "oo" of us.

44:09.012 --> 44:12.413
"Amy" we should "ust" separate.

44:12.482 --> 44:16.179
You're right. You're a genius.
There's two of us.

44:16.253 --> 44:19.188
If we separate and you steal a car,
we can both go our own way...

44:19.256 --> 44:21.224
and double our chances
of gettin' there first.

44:21.291 --> 44:23.851
All right. You take the--

44:23.927 --> 44:26.225
We only got one "ee."

44:28.665 --> 44:32.795
Look, there it is.
Totem Pole Ranch, turn left.

44:32.869 --> 44:37.238
1.8 miles exactly.
All right, squirrel lady.

44:41.244 --> 44:45.943
I can't believe it, Dad. You stole
Adolf Hitler's Mercedes-Benz.

44:46.016 --> 44:50.282
Hitler had it comin'.
What goes around comes around.

44:50.353 --> 44:52.321
They're gonna be pissed.

44:52.389 --> 44:56.951
They're always pissed. They're
Nazis. It's like it's their job.

44:57.027 --> 45:02.329
When we get to Silver City, we'll
call 'em. We'll work somethin' out.

45:07.904 --> 45:09.337
North?

45:09.406 --> 45:11.840
A little detour.
It'll just take a minute.

45:11.908 --> 45:14.399
I just wanted to say hi
to my boyfriend.

45:22.652 --> 45:26.315
I can't believe it.
That-- That son of a bitch!

45:26.389 --> 45:28.414
That's Charlene's car.

45:28.492 --> 45:31.859
-Charlene?
-His ex-girlfriend, or so I thought.

45:31.928 --> 45:36.126
Come on now. I'm sure there's
a perfectly innocent explanation.

45:36.199 --> 45:39.225
She probably came by just
to pick up some clothes or--

45:39.302 --> 45:42.328
Nice and warm.

45:48.578 --> 45:50.068
What the--

45:50.180 --> 45:52.410
Get down!

45:54.351 --> 45:57.946
Did I come at
a bad time, asshole?

46:00.590 --> 46:03.957
I'll ram this helicopter
right down your throat!

46:09.099 --> 46:10.191
What are you doing?

46:10.267 --> 46:15.034
Don't worry. My father's a navy pilot.
I've been flying since I was 15.

46:15.138 --> 46:18.005
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about me.

46:18.074 --> 46:22.602
Shawn, you have a minute? I want
to talk about our relationship.

46:36.726 --> 46:38.489
Suck on that, creep!

46:41.198 --> 46:44.133
- That's--
- Not the truck!

46:44.201 --> 46:47.136
Oh, my God!

46:47.237 --> 46:49.398
Come on. Help me. Open it.

46:49.506 --> 46:51.167
I'm not comfortable--

46:51.274 --> 46:53.208
- Open it!
- Okay.

46:59.683 --> 47:01.116
She's gonna kill me.

47:01.184 --> 47:03.744
- We should get outta here.
- Not yet!

47:04.855 --> 47:08.347
You two-timing,
backstabbing snake!

47:08.425 --> 47:10.586
You worm! You turd!

47:13.496 --> 47:19.196
My God! What was I thinking?
I want my five months back!

47:20.637 --> 47:23.162
I'm getting the tattoo removed!

47:27.277 --> 47:29.245
Stop hitting me!

47:29.312 --> 47:32.713
Where are you goin', baby?
Wait for me!

47:51.935 --> 47:56.702
- I think we just killed him.
- You can't! He's like a cockroach.

48:02.846 --> 48:04.245
Fix the--

48:08.418 --> 48:10.477
Should we be this low?

48:15.692 --> 48:19.059
Come on. Come on.
Let's keep goin'. Come on.

48:22.565 --> 48:25.932
We just violated
about 115 federal laws.

48:26.002 --> 48:28.664
- "We"?
- I'm getting out of here. Coming?

48:30.640 --> 48:32.574
I know things look bad--

48:34.711 --> 48:36.645
Nice meeting you.

48:39.816 --> 48:41.841
Get out of the truck, Shawn.

48:43.286 --> 48:45.379
That's it, Tracy.
You and I are through.

48:48.959 --> 48:50.551
Wait!

48:58.068 --> 49:01.731
Wait. This is the first illegal thing
I've done in my adult life.

49:01.838 --> 49:03.772
How does it feel?

49:03.840 --> 49:07.173
I'm shaking, but that could be
from the helicopter crash.

49:07.243 --> 49:11.475
- Get out of my truck, Tracy!
- It's my truck! I paid for it!

49:11.548 --> 49:13.140
- Who is this?
- Nobody.

49:13.216 --> 49:15.741
- You are nobody.
- Nobody.

49:15.819 --> 49:19.812
You stay away from her, nobody,
unless you're tired of livin'.

49:19.889 --> 49:24.121
While you're here, do me a favor.
Charlene left a bra in the truck.

49:24.194 --> 49:27.595
Could you make sure
she gets it? Thanks, honey.

49:27.664 --> 49:28.722
Help!

50:17.013 --> 50:20.005
- So where's the driver?
- He's in the powder room.

50:20.083 --> 50:23.814
Hell's bells. We're never
gonna get to Santa Fe by 3:00.

50:23.887 --> 50:25.821
- This is ridiculous.
- Ridiculous.

50:25.889 --> 50:29.893
I really wish he'd hurry.
It just seems very unprofessional.

50:36.833 --> 50:39.461
Mister, you gotta help me.
My wife--

50:39.536 --> 50:40.969
She's out back.
She's having a baby.

50:41.037 --> 50:43.005
- She's having a what?
- A baby!

50:43.073 --> 50:45.007
- She's having a baby?
- And it's halfway out!

50:45.075 --> 50:47.441
I can see the head!

50:47.544 --> 50:50.513
- I need your jacket.
- Why?

50:51.881 --> 50:54.782
For her amniotic sac!

50:54.851 --> 50:57.479
- Her amniotic fluid is gushing out.
- Gushing?

50:57.554 --> 51:00.717
The jacket! The jacket!
Give me the jacket!

51:00.790 --> 51:03.725
- And your pants.
- My pants?

51:03.793 --> 51:07.126
Your pants! Yeah, for her,
you know, her "placentia"...

51:07.197 --> 51:10.189
you know,
and her labia and cervical--

51:10.266 --> 51:13.463
Mucus gushing-- It's gushing.

51:13.536 --> 51:17.063
It's just a hole and--

51:17.140 --> 51:19.506
Quick! The pants.
And the hat.

51:19.609 --> 51:21.304
Why? Why my hat?

51:23.446 --> 51:24.845
For her...

51:26.583 --> 51:27.845
vagina.

51:31.154 --> 51:33.247
Let's go, ladies.
All aboard. We're on our way.

51:33.323 --> 51:37.851
- What happened to Marty?
- His wife's having a baby.

51:37.961 --> 51:41.692
-A baby?
-I'm Owen, your new driver. Let's go.

51:42.599 --> 51:44.191
Quiet. Quiet, everybody.

51:44.267 --> 51:46.201
Simmer down. Hey!

51:46.936 --> 51:50.235
We're gonna be under way
in just a minute. This is Owen.

51:50.306 --> 51:53.139
He's our new driver.

51:53.209 --> 51:55.677
Everyone say hello.

51:55.745 --> 51:59.613
Hello, Owen!

51:59.682 --> 52:02.242
Our next stop is
the third annual...

52:02.318 --> 52:06.345
I Love Lucy convention
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

52:06.456 --> 52:10.187
- What do ya say?
- Ba-ba-loo!

52:24.440 --> 52:26.738
Ohh! Ohh !

52:43.693 --> 52:46.719
- Is he dead?
- Hey, mister, are you dead?

52:49.199 --> 52:52.259
It's a race.
It's a race. It's a race.

52:53.336 --> 52:56.737
Run, run,
like greased lightning.

52:57.540 --> 53:00.373
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

53:06.182 --> 53:08.446
Not good. Not good.

53:14.891 --> 53:17.451
Don't move! Stay there.
I saw the whole thing.

53:17.560 --> 53:18.822
I'll be right down.

53:18.895 --> 53:22.592
Shit! Gloria Allred.

53:22.665 --> 53:25.998
Hey, buddy?
Buddy, you okay? You okay?

53:26.069 --> 53:28.435
You're fine! You look great.

53:28.504 --> 53:30.495
- You want to report this?
- Taxi!

53:30.573 --> 53:32.541
You don't need a taxi.
Come on!

53:32.609 --> 53:34.600
Where you goin'?
Maybe I can drop you off.

53:34.677 --> 53:37.373
Silver City, New Mexico.
I am in a race.

53:37.447 --> 53:40.041
Silver City?
This is your lucky day!

53:40.116 --> 53:43.085
I'm going to El Paso.
It's right on the way.

53:43.152 --> 53:46.986
Come on. But, look, I got
to be there by 7:00 tonight.

53:47.090 --> 53:50.082
- So I'm going to be driving fast.
- Great.

53:50.193 --> 53:51.125
Yeah!

53:52.562 --> 53:56.362
You just want one copy, 'cause
you get an extra one for half price?

53:56.432 --> 53:58.764
Just one and hurry.

53:58.835 --> 54:00.769
This is the best idea
you ever had.

54:00.837 --> 54:03.362
We split up. We take two keys.
We double our chances of winning.

54:03.439 --> 54:04.599
It can't fail.

54:04.674 --> 54:08.132
- You remember where we're goin'?
- Silver City, New Mexico.

54:08.211 --> 54:10.839
Right. Train station, locker 001.

54:10.913 --> 54:12.904
"Ero, ero," one.

54:12.982 --> 54:15.542
Rule number one: discretion.
Don't talk to anybody.

54:15.618 --> 54:17.643
- I won't. I "romise."
- I'm serious.

54:17.720 --> 54:20.450
We're talking about
$2 million in cash.

54:20.556 --> 54:23.889
People would just kill us
to get their hands on that key.

54:23.960 --> 54:26.986
I love you.

54:27.997 --> 54:29.931
All right, little brother,
you steal a car.

54:29.999 --> 54:32.365
I'm gonna try to steal
that Corvette right there.

54:32.435 --> 54:34.369
I don't care what you get
as long as it's fast.

54:34.437 --> 54:37.668
I'll meet you in Silver City.
Don't forget your key.

54:39.475 --> 54:42.808
That "other-ucking" bastard!

54:42.879 --> 54:45.848
I'll kill 'im! I'm gonna--

54:49.419 --> 54:50.852
There he is!

54:52.088 --> 54:54.852
Go! Go!

54:55.958 --> 54:58.483
Okay, we're at 2.4 miles.

54:58.594 --> 55:00.061
There's the yellow sign
with the graffiti.

55:00.163 --> 55:01.858
- Turn right.
- I see it.

55:01.931 --> 55:03.330
- Do you see it?
- I see it.

55:03.399 --> 55:06.425
I just love this.
This is like a treasure hunt.

55:08.971 --> 55:11.439
- Slow down!
- I can't!

55:15.912 --> 55:17.971
Help!

55:47.343 --> 55:51.677
I guess my favorite episode, if l
had to pick one, would be episode 34.

55:51.748 --> 55:55.013
Ladies, Lucys, Lucys,
stay behind the line, please.

55:55.084 --> 55:58.315
Remember that one when Ricky
wouldn't take his hat off?

55:58.388 --> 56:01.755
I don't remember that one.
It sounds like a masterpiece.

56:01.858 --> 56:04.656
How about the one where
she got caught in the freezer?

56:04.727 --> 56:08.754
Ma'am? Lucy! You have
to put that out, please.

56:18.374 --> 56:20.342
Lucy, your hair!

56:20.410 --> 56:24.676
Thank you. I couldn't decide whether
to keep it up or try something new.

56:24.747 --> 56:27.238
It's on fire!

56:35.124 --> 56:37.718
- Stop the bus!
- We're not stoppin'!

56:37.827 --> 56:40.421
Just put it out!
Just put it out!

56:40.530 --> 56:43.124
Stop!

56:43.733 --> 56:44.927
The bathroom!

57:15.085 --> 57:19.681
Two million dollars. Two million
dollars. Two million dollars.

57:19.756 --> 57:24.318
Two million dollars. Two million
dollars. Two million dollars.

57:24.394 --> 57:27.090
The Donald Sinclair,
the billionaire?

57:27.163 --> 57:30.360
It sounds crazy, I know,
but I think it's on the level.

57:30.433 --> 57:33.334
Here's the thing. We have
to decide yes or no right now.

57:33.403 --> 57:38.067
If everybody else had to drive,
we have a three-hour head start.

57:38.141 --> 57:41.975
- So you're proposing?
- A corporation-- Faucet and Schaffer.

57:42.078 --> 57:46.014
If we win, we split everything
50-50. You can even hold the key.

57:47.350 --> 57:49.011
What do ya think?

57:50.220 --> 57:52.745
I don't know what to think.
I'm in shock.

57:52.822 --> 57:58.124
Three hours ago I was in the airport.
I had a job. I was reading a book.

57:58.194 --> 58:00.685
My grandfather used to say,
"Good things take time.

58:00.763 --> 58:03.357
Great things
happen all at once."

58:09.105 --> 58:13.735
- Jason, where'd you get that?
- I found it under the seat.

58:13.843 --> 58:18.007
- Give it to me. You can't play that.
- Why not?

58:18.114 --> 58:21.345
Because it's Hitler's harmonica.
You can't play Hitler's harmonica.

58:21.417 --> 58:25.820
- You're driving his car.
- I'm not touching it with my mouth.

58:25.889 --> 58:29.586
I'm not sucking on the dashboard.
I'm not gettin' his germs.

58:29.659 --> 58:31.684
Dad, look what I found.

58:31.761 --> 58:36.562
- Where'd you get those?
- The floor. Look, I'm Mrs. Hitler.

58:36.633 --> 58:38.658
All right, take those
off right now.

58:38.735 --> 58:41.670
Hey, look at this.
A lipstick. It's dark.

58:41.738 --> 58:43.729
That Eva Braun had style,
didn't she?

58:43.806 --> 58:46.536
- She was Hitler's girlfriend.
- Give us a kiss.

58:46.609 --> 58:49.578
Bev, it's not funny.
Give me that.

58:49.646 --> 58:51.705
- Honey!
- I got it all over my hand.

58:51.814 --> 58:52.781
Oh...

58:52.849 --> 58:54.180
Randy.

59:00.123 --> 59:02.387
- Chain, chain, chain
- R-E-S-P-E-C- T

59:02.458 --> 59:04.858
- Chain, chain, chain
- find out what it means to me

59:04.928 --> 59:07.522
Respect
Just a little bit

59:07.597 --> 59:09.861
- Just a little bit
- Chain, chain, chain--

59:09.933 --> 59:11.366
Just--

59:13.303 --> 59:16.431
Look at us go.
We are zooming.

59:16.539 --> 59:18.700
I told you.
We're haulin' ass.

59:18.808 --> 59:22.642
We're haulin' ass.
All righty.

59:26.115 --> 59:29.778
- Guess what I got back there.
- You just told me.

59:29.852 --> 59:32.150
Ass. We're haulin' ass.

59:32.222 --> 59:34.850
No, no, no.
That's just an expression.

59:38.728 --> 59:39.990
It's a heart.

59:41.297 --> 59:45.063
- A heart?
- A human heart.

59:46.069 --> 59:49.232
Some lucky bastard
in El Paso's waiting for it.

59:49.973 --> 59:54.774
Normally, they put it on a plane,
but the airport's all closed down.

59:59.115 --> 01:00:02.516
- You wanna see it?
- See what?

01:00:11.928 --> 01:00:13.896
Are we allowed?

01:00:13.963 --> 01:00:17.592
Just take a peek. One peek.
What could happen?

01:00:19.469 --> 01:00:22.404
It's a heart.
It needs fresh air.

01:00:22.472 --> 01:00:25.441
It's been locked up
in that cooler for seven hours.

01:01:01.377 --> 01:01:04.175
- Oopsy-daisy. I get it. I get it.
- Shit! Oh, please!

01:01:04.247 --> 01:01:06.738
- Don't step on it!
- I think I found it.

01:01:06.816 --> 01:01:08.750
No, that's a caramel apple.

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:23.596
This is wrong.
This is so wrong.

01:01:23.666 --> 01:01:26.635
God is gonna smote us.
We're gonna get smote.

01:01:26.736 --> 01:01:29.432
Come on. We're siphoning gas.
It's not a smoting offense.

01:01:29.539 --> 01:01:31.473
What?

01:01:38.014 --> 01:01:40.005
Shouldn't be
turning me on, should it?

01:01:44.487 --> 01:01:46.148
- Hey!
- Hi.

01:01:46.222 --> 01:01:50.056
- What are you doing?
- Seventeen cups of coffee.

01:01:54.697 --> 01:01:56.790
I guess--

01:01:56.866 --> 01:01:58.766
I guess that's it.

01:02:00.837 --> 01:02:04.170
I guess not.
How do you turn this thing off?

01:02:04.774 --> 01:02:06.366
Son of a bitch!

01:02:13.916 --> 01:02:18.012
- Man! Damn it!
- Keep going. Go! Go!

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:22.524
He's stopping.

01:02:22.592 --> 01:02:24.583
'Cause he knows,
don't mess with us.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.514
We gotta wait.
There's too much wind.

01:02:46.582 --> 01:02:51.178
- Guys, I need this balloon.
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:02:51.254 --> 01:02:53.188
Hey, man, what--

01:02:57.794 --> 01:02:59.887
- Hey, hey!
- I know what I'm doing!

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:07.769
I'm coming to get you!
Get back here!

01:03:12.442 --> 01:03:16.378
I'll get him. I'm gonna get you,
stupid hardware guy!

01:03:21.384 --> 01:03:27.050
- Go! Go!
- Stand up. Grab the rope.

01:03:27.123 --> 01:03:30.615
I'm gonna get you!
Stand up. Ready? Grab it.

01:03:32.728 --> 01:03:34.662
Missed it.

01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:38.962
- Duane! Duane, stop the car!
- Hang on, buddy.

01:03:39.035 --> 01:03:41.060
Duane, please stop.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.003
I got it! I got it!
Just hang on.

01:03:54.817 --> 01:03:59.117
- Stop it! Blaine!
- My God! You're gonna kill me!

01:04:00.223 --> 01:04:02.157
The cows!

01:04:05.995 --> 01:04:07.326
Move!

01:04:11.634 --> 01:04:13.067
Watch out!

01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:34.715
Shit.

01:04:47.103 --> 01:04:49.196
Oh, God!

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.881
Help!

01:05:05.454 --> 01:05:07.445
- Give me my key.
- What are you talking about?

01:05:07.523 --> 01:05:09.582
Give me back my key.
The key!

01:05:11.928 --> 01:05:14.021
Give me the key.

01:06:01.811 --> 01:06:05.645
Blaine! Blaine!
It's me.

01:06:16.826 --> 01:06:18.760
I got the key.

01:06:25.434 --> 01:06:27.026
How's it going, Captain?

01:06:27.136 --> 01:06:29.070
So far, so good.

01:06:29.138 --> 01:06:33.268
- How about a pit stop?
- Sorry. This is a one-way flight.

01:06:33.376 --> 01:06:35.310
There's a bathroom
in the back.

01:06:35.378 --> 01:06:38.404
The latch is broken.
Anybody could just come in.

01:06:38.481 --> 01:06:44.186
So what? You ain't got nothing
the other Lucys haven't seen already.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.252
Not necessarily.

01:06:45.521 --> 01:06:47.546
Please, would you
stop screaming?

01:06:48.391 --> 01:06:49.449
Damn!

01:06:53.396 --> 01:06:54.829
Help me!

01:06:54.897 --> 01:06:57.422
For God's sake, help me!

01:07:10.279 --> 01:07:12.474
Oh, shit.

01:07:18.154 --> 01:07:21.351
Owen!
Owen, what are you doing?

01:07:21.424 --> 01:07:23.358
It's a flat tire.
Please, stay on the bus.

01:07:23.459 --> 01:07:26.951
- Well, you're turning it the wrong way.
- I know what I'm doing.

01:07:27.063 --> 01:07:30.794
- Please, get on the bus. Wait!
- Maybe we should check the oil.

01:07:30.866 --> 01:07:34.802
I think you're supposed to change
the air in the tires every 12,000 miles.

01:07:34.904 --> 01:07:37.566
- I can fix it.
- Give me that!

01:07:39.208 --> 01:07:41.369
Wait! That's the spare!

01:07:50.453 --> 01:07:51.977
We'll still catch it.

01:08:18.013 --> 01:08:20.675
Turn it around.
Just turn it around.

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:24.310
Please be careful.
Wait, wait, wait. What is that?

01:08:26.555 --> 01:08:29.649
- It's a nickel.
- Would you please put it in the bag?

01:08:47.243 --> 01:08:51.542
Why don't you check over there?
Maybe it bounced.

01:08:53.983 --> 01:08:58.147
- I'm a dead man.
- Don't worry. We will find the heart.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:02.281
I have lost my heart
many times before.

01:09:06.028 --> 01:09:07.962
I make a joke...

01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:11.988
to help you forget
how screwed you are.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:16.935
I don't think it got this far.
Let's check down by the road.

01:09:17.006 --> 01:09:19.133
Oh, hello. A doggy.

01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:21.540
Hello. Hello. Hello there.

01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:23.874
Isn't he a good doggy?

01:09:23.946 --> 01:09:26.540
Come on. Come on.
Fetch. Fetch it.

01:09:28.317 --> 01:09:31.286
Look at him go.

01:09:33.122 --> 01:09:35.783
- Here, boy!
- Doggy!

01:09:35.858 --> 01:09:37.291
Good boy!

01:09:42.298 --> 01:09:43.890
- It really is a beautiful car.
- Yeah.

01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:46.160
- Look at this mahogany.
- Gorgeous.

01:09:46.234 --> 01:09:49.328
You just don't see
that anymore, you know?

01:09:49.404 --> 01:09:52.499
- I wonder what this is.
- Careful. That's a cigarette lighter.

01:09:52.575 --> 01:09:54.509
- No, I don't think they had those then.
- Yes, they did.

01:09:55.311 --> 01:09:57.404
Oh, honey!
Did you burn yourself?

01:09:57.479 --> 01:09:59.606
- Yeah. Oh, God!
- Oh, I told you.

01:10:03.085 --> 01:10:05.076
Sorry.

01:10:05.154 --> 01:10:07.645
My husband,
he burned his finger, ma'am.

01:10:07.723 --> 01:10:11.454
- He was pulling, then he was waving--
- Bev, Bev, not helping.

01:10:12.695 --> 01:10:14.629
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:17.266 --> 01:10:20.360
I really like
your dike. Bike.

01:10:22.605 --> 01:10:23.537
It's nice.

01:10:28.677 --> 01:10:31.646
Cut 'em off!
Get in front!

01:10:32.414 --> 01:10:35.042
- Hey! What are you, nuts?
- Get down!

01:10:35.117 --> 01:10:37.210
Kids, stay down!
This thing won't go any faster!

01:10:37.286 --> 01:10:39.686
Stop it! The headlights!
The headlight!

01:10:39.755 --> 01:10:44.385
- Oh, my God!
- Are you insane? This is Hitler's car!

01:11:02.578 --> 01:11:05.877
Honey, go ask them for help.
Tell them everything that happened.

01:11:05.948 --> 01:11:08.348
And ask them
to call the police.

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:10.351
And a tow truck.

01:11:54.663 --> 01:11:56.893
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:11:56.966 --> 01:11:59.400
- Are you Harold?
- Yes.

01:11:59.501 --> 01:12:01.969
I'm Vicky.

01:12:03.005 --> 01:12:05.030
Are you gonna
invite me in, Harry?

01:12:05.107 --> 01:12:07.200
Or would you rather
party out here in the hallway?

01:12:08.143 --> 01:12:09.303
Please. Come in.

01:12:13.482 --> 01:12:15.416
Not too shabby.

01:12:16.585 --> 01:12:19.281
- Where are you from, Harry?
- From here.

01:12:19.355 --> 01:12:22.950
- Las Vegas.
- A local boy makes good.

01:12:25.027 --> 01:12:28.827
So, Harry,
what can I do for you?

01:12:29.898 --> 01:12:32.093
Okay. Here's what I want.

01:12:33.335 --> 01:12:34.893
First we both get naked.

01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:39.407
- So far, so good.
- Only we're wearing sailor hats.

01:12:40.642 --> 01:12:41.666
And then...

01:12:42.745 --> 01:12:45.839
we get into a Jacuzzi...

01:12:45.914 --> 01:12:48.178
filled with Pepto-Bismol.

01:12:48.984 --> 01:12:49.916
And...

01:12:50.986 --> 01:12:53.420
I clip your toenails...

01:12:53.489 --> 01:12:55.684
and you shave my buttocks.

01:12:57.092 --> 01:12:59.060
Pardon me?

01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:03.030
Okay, naked,
Jacuzzi, Pepto-Bismol...

01:13:03.098 --> 01:13:06.033
toenails,
shave my buttocks.

01:13:06.101 --> 01:13:07.728
How much would that cost?

01:13:07.803 --> 01:13:11.295
Geez, honey,
you have quite an imagination.

01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:13.640
How much would it cost?

01:13:15.811 --> 01:13:18.302
Well, let's see.

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:21.838
A party like that--

01:13:21.917 --> 01:13:23.851
three thousand dollars.

01:13:23.919 --> 01:13:27.616
Okay, 3,000.
Who has 3,000?

01:13:27.689 --> 01:13:29.714
Carlton had 2,800.
He's the closest.

01:13:50.279 --> 01:13:53.271
I think it's okay.
What do you think?

01:13:53.348 --> 01:13:56.647
What about those little holes?

01:13:56.718 --> 01:13:59.551
Are they bite marks?

01:13:59.621 --> 01:14:03.592
That's-- That's how it was.
I'm-- I'm pretty sure.

01:14:03.725 --> 01:14:05.556
What am I doing?

01:14:05.661 --> 01:14:08.095
I can't go
to El Paso with this.

01:14:08.163 --> 01:14:11.223
Look at it.
It's gonna leak like a sieve.

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:14.268
The guy's gonna be alive
for like two minutes and then--

01:14:21.343 --> 01:14:24.676
- A drifter.
- A drifter?

01:14:25.614 --> 01:14:28.708
We-- We find a drifter...

01:14:28.784 --> 01:14:30.752
kill him,
cut out his heart.

01:14:30.819 --> 01:14:33.549
Nobody's gonna miss him, right?
I mean, he's a drifter.

01:14:33.622 --> 01:14:35.681
He's an invisible man.
It's a perfect plan.

01:14:35.757 --> 01:14:38.692
Mr. Zack, now you are
giving me the freak-out.

01:14:40.329 --> 01:14:42.797
Where--
Where do I find a drifter?

01:14:48.837 --> 01:14:50.099
Enrico.

01:14:51.507 --> 01:14:55.204
- Where did you say you were from?
- Me? I am from Napoli.

01:14:56.612 --> 01:14:59.877
And your family,
they're back there?

01:14:59.948 --> 01:15:03.714
No. No, my papa, he is dead.

01:15:03.785 --> 01:15:08.688
And my mama. All gone.

01:15:08.757 --> 01:15:11.419
Any family? Kids?

01:15:14.129 --> 01:15:18.122
I am completely alone.

01:15:18.233 --> 01:15:20.599
Why--

01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:23.467
Why do you--

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:29.041
Look, a drifter.
Let's kill him.

01:15:29.111 --> 01:15:31.045
Son of a--
Come back here!

01:15:53.602 --> 01:15:56.901
Whatever. Listen, sugar.
You're not going anywhere today.

01:15:56.972 --> 01:15:58.599
You got a crack
in your radiator.

01:15:58.674 --> 01:16:01.268
That's this big tank
in front of this big engine.

01:16:01.343 --> 01:16:04.369
- I know what a radiator is.
- Is there a place we can rent a car?

01:16:04.446 --> 01:16:06.744
- Albuquerque.
- Okay, look.

01:16:06.848 --> 01:16:08.816
We'll just have to patch it.
A quick fix.

01:16:08.884 --> 01:16:12.786
- Patch it? Patch it with what?
- Sand and tire sealant.

01:16:12.854 --> 01:16:16.551
You mix the two. It forms an
adhesive, lasting a couple of hours.

01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:18.559
We only have about
30 miles to go?

01:16:18.627 --> 01:16:21.562
Darlin',
we don't have any sand.

01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:24.963
Hello!
We're in the desert!

01:16:30.939 --> 01:16:33.032
We should've
bought a squirrel.

01:16:40.382 --> 01:16:44.546
Mother of mercy!
Where'd you come from? Car trouble?

01:16:44.653 --> 01:16:48.589
Here. Sit down.
You two look exhausted.

01:16:48.657 --> 01:16:51.592
How long y'all been out there?
Here. Have something to drink.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:54.185
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the press--

01:16:54.263 --> 01:16:58.427
- What's going on?
- Some rocket scientists from L.A....

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:01.025
they're trying to break
the land speed record.

01:17:03.972 --> 01:17:07.669
A unique combination of automotive
and aerodynamic innovation.

01:17:07.743 --> 01:17:10.007
The vehicle, which
we call Lightning ll...

01:17:10.078 --> 01:17:11.807
represents three years
of R & D...

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.281
which was conducted at the
California Institute of Technology.

01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:20.287
The design team was led by Professor
Ken Freedman and Dr. Richard Kramer.

01:17:20.389 --> 01:17:22.857
We believe
that, aerodynamically...

01:17:22.924 --> 01:17:25.620
this is the most perfect
vehicle ever designed.

01:17:25.694 --> 01:17:29.494
The entire vehicle weighs
less than 1,850 pounds.

01:17:29.564 --> 01:17:32.260
The body is a one-piece
Kevlar composite.

01:17:32.334 --> 01:17:34.461
The wheels are
solid billet aluminum...

01:17:34.536 --> 01:17:38.199
and she's powered by twin
JE-79 turbojet engines...

01:17:38.273 --> 01:17:40.935
the same engines that are
in the F-4 Phantom jet.

01:17:41.009 --> 01:17:42.943
Are there any questions?

01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:45.445
Mr. Calvert, what is
the current land speed record?

01:17:45.514 --> 01:17:47.539
That would be
742 miles per hour...

01:17:47.649 --> 01:17:50.140
but we hope to have
a new record today.

01:17:50.252 --> 01:17:53.688
- Anyone else?
- How do you start it?

01:17:53.789 --> 01:17:55.882
Good question.

01:17:55.957 --> 01:17:58.255
A green lever to the left of the
steering wheel in the cockpit...

01:17:58.327 --> 01:18:01.421
engages the primary thruster,
igniting the JE--

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:16.744
740, 745--

01:18:16.812 --> 01:18:18.837
- That's a record.
- They'll break the sound barrier.

01:18:22.384 --> 01:18:25.717
Well, that's it. I still don't
think she's gonna hold.

01:18:25.787 --> 01:18:28.915
- What do we owe you?
- Five hundred bucks.

01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:32.357
- What?
- For two quarts of sealant?

01:18:32.427 --> 01:18:35.453
No way.
That's 20 bucks tops.

01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:38.328
Okay, here's 40 dollars.
That's double what it's worth, okay?

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.334
Come on, Nick. Let's go.

01:18:41.903 --> 01:18:42.995
Hold it.

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.002
Another little tool
no mechanic should be without.

01:18:49.578 --> 01:18:53.708
Fine. Here's your $500.
But you know what, Billy Ray?

01:18:53.815 --> 01:18:55.749
What goes around,
comes around.

01:18:55.817 --> 01:18:57.751
This is so unchristian.

01:18:57.819 --> 01:18:59.582
Unchristian?

01:19:00.689 --> 01:19:04.125
Well, if the good Lord don't
like the way I conduct business...

01:19:04.192 --> 01:19:05.853
let him say something.

01:19:05.927 --> 01:19:08.122
Let him give me a sign.

01:19:08.196 --> 01:19:12.098
Oh, Lord, I'm here
and I'm listening!

01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:14.192
Hello!

01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:23.277
- Mach one!
- We did it! We did it!

01:19:29.484 --> 01:19:32.419
Hey, everybody okay?
You all right? Yeah?

01:19:32.487 --> 01:19:36.082
- Randy, you okay?
- There's no Ink Inc.

01:19:36.158 --> 01:19:39.150
- What?
- There's no job.

01:19:40.829 --> 01:19:43.093
It's a race. We're racing.

01:19:43.165 --> 01:19:45.326
Donald Sinclair put
$2 million in a locker.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.595
And I wanna get there first.

01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:52.606
I do not want
to work at Home Depot!

01:20:23.572 --> 01:20:25.836
Okay, people,
back on the bus.

01:20:25.907 --> 01:20:28.034
George, don't eat that.

01:20:28.109 --> 01:20:31.545
Get back on the bus!
Come on. Back on the bus.

01:20:31.613 --> 01:20:33.547
Simon, put that down.

01:20:33.648 --> 01:20:37.311
You too. Back on the bus.
Come on, everyone!

01:20:37.419 --> 01:20:40.786
We don't wanna miss dinner.
It's macaroni night!

01:20:44.326 --> 01:20:45.725
We came in
the rocket car.

01:20:45.794 --> 01:20:50.254
Oh, a rocket car. Let's hear
all about that on the bus.

01:20:50.332 --> 01:20:52.323
All right,
so we can still win...

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.392
but we have
to leave now, all right?

01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:58.064
- So, come on.
- Dad.

01:20:58.139 --> 01:21:00.334
It's been a living hell.

01:21:00.408 --> 01:21:04.174
Bev, it's-- it's $2 million.

01:21:04.246 --> 01:21:07.477
That's a lifetime supply
of hummus.

01:21:15.156 --> 01:21:18.091
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

01:21:18.159 --> 01:21:21.060
I've been selfish.
I understand.

01:21:21.129 --> 01:21:24.428
I'm sorry. Really.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:21:24.499 --> 01:21:28.663
I'm sorry.
I almost got us killed.

01:21:33.241 --> 01:21:35.232
God!

01:21:43.451 --> 01:21:47.012
- Hi, everybody. Miss me?
- Hey!

01:21:47.122 --> 01:21:50.717
To show there's no hard feelings,
chocolate shakes all around.

01:21:50.792 --> 01:21:53.761
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:21:53.828 --> 01:21:56.888
I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm an adult.

01:21:56.965 --> 01:21:59.490
So drink these up, and then
we'll return the Nazi-mobile.

01:21:59.568 --> 01:22:03.231
We'll get that van fixed, go back
to Vegas and see David Copperfield!

01:22:03.305 --> 01:22:07.298
Yea! Okay,
drink up, buddy!

01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:09.104
Is it good?

01:22:09.177 --> 01:22:11.111
Drink it up, honey.

01:22:14.683 --> 01:22:17.208
Oh, don't feel bad.

01:22:17.319 --> 01:22:19.810
- It's not your fault.
- We'll tell the company.

01:22:19.921 --> 01:22:22.321
We won't let them
fire you.

01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:24.858
- I'm no bus driver.
- Don't say that.

01:22:24.926 --> 01:22:28.123
No. I'm not.
I'm not a bus driver.

01:22:28.196 --> 01:22:30.994
Oh, you mustn't be
so hard on yourself.

01:22:31.066 --> 01:22:34.399
Hey, everybody, who's
the world's greatest bus driver?

01:22:41.576 --> 01:22:42.804
Listen. Listen. No, no!

01:22:42.877 --> 01:22:46.973
No! No! Shut up, you crazy
Lucy bitches! Shut up!

01:22:49.284 --> 01:22:52.048
I am not a bus driver!

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:56.216
I do not work for
the bus company! All right?

01:22:56.291 --> 01:23:00.887
I needed a ride to New Mexico,
so I stole this uniform!

01:23:00.962 --> 01:23:04.796
See this jacket?
This is not my jacket!

01:23:04.866 --> 01:23:06.834
Remember Marty,
the bus driver?

01:23:07.702 --> 01:23:11.069
This is his shirt!
I stole it!

01:23:11.139 --> 01:23:13.539
And these pants, you think
I'd wear these pants?

01:23:13.608 --> 01:23:16.042
These aren't my pants!

01:23:16.111 --> 01:23:18.807
These are Marty's pants.
I stole them.

01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:25.386
I am not a bus driver.

01:23:27.989 --> 01:23:30.890
You're not
a real bus driver?

01:23:30.959 --> 01:23:33.257
You lied to us!

01:23:33.328 --> 01:23:35.853
He ruined
our whole vacation!

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:49.774
Here they come.
They're all within 50 miles.

01:23:49.844 --> 01:23:52.506
It's the final lap.
Mr. Grisham.

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:55.708
Now, the airport's back on-line, so
I want you to take the Lear jet...

01:23:55.817 --> 01:23:59.048
scoot on down to Silver City
and report from the finish line.

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.918
Yes, sir.

01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:03.124
Yes!

01:24:25.613 --> 01:24:27.547
Let's go back to Vegas.

01:24:29.551 --> 01:24:32.543
Bev, Bev, wake--
Come on. Wake up. Wake up.

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:35.555
Bev, wake up. Wake up.
Third Reich's here. Come on.

01:24:35.623 --> 01:24:37.557
Get down. You wanna
have a nice life.

01:24:37.625 --> 01:24:41.083
Okay, okay. Think. Think.
SS in the parking lot.

01:24:41.162 --> 01:24:43.096
Not good. Not good. Think.

01:24:46.701 --> 01:24:47.725
Hi, honey.

01:24:48.837 --> 01:24:50.771
- They gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

01:24:50.839 --> 01:24:54.502
Friend, I don't
think there's room.

01:24:56.144 --> 01:24:58.078
This one's little.

01:24:59.814 --> 01:25:03.011
- There it is. There it is!
- Silver City. We're almost there.

01:25:03.084 --> 01:25:05.416
Yeah! Go!

01:26:33.508 --> 01:26:35.601
Where the fuck are we?

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:44.608
There were two guys
in there.

01:27:44.679 --> 01:27:46.613
- Where'd they go?
- Hey!

01:27:46.681 --> 01:27:48.273
Thanks for the truck, buddy!

01:28:51.646 --> 01:28:53.841
- Yeah.
- Silver City.

01:28:53.915 --> 01:28:56.008
Next stop, Silver City.

01:28:56.084 --> 01:28:59.576
Silver City?
It is the finish line.

01:28:59.654 --> 01:29:02.885
I made it. I made it!

01:29:04.892 --> 01:29:08.988
The key.
Where is the key?

01:29:12.633 --> 01:29:15.227
What have we-- Where is
the key, my little baby?

01:29:15.303 --> 01:29:18.238
- Excuse me.
- I think I am touching it.

01:29:18.306 --> 01:29:22.265
- Get away from him.
- I can feel it. It's very small.

01:29:22.343 --> 01:29:26.746
- I'm calling the conductor!
- I have it! I got it!

01:29:26.814 --> 01:29:30.079
Wait! Wait!
Come back! Don't leave me!

01:29:35.356 --> 01:29:37.950
Come on! Come on, baby!

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.321
Giddyap!

01:29:45.433 --> 01:29:49.301
Come on, baby.
Just one more mile.

01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:51.804
Just one mile.
Come on!

01:29:53.007 --> 01:29:54.941
Randy?

01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:58.171
Hey, honey,
how'd you sleep?

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.317
- Pass. Pass him.
- I can't. We're too big.

01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:13.417
There's Silver City.
We're here. Move!

01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:17.964
They stopped.

01:30:20.902 --> 01:30:22.563
They're moving. Look.

01:30:31.946 --> 01:30:33.880
Come on, Dad! Let's go!

01:30:36.851 --> 01:30:37.909
I can smell it.

01:30:37.985 --> 01:30:41.944
Daisy, Daisy

01:30:42.023 --> 01:30:45.481
Give meyouranswertrue

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:49.496
Daisy, Daisy

01:30:56.871 --> 01:30:59.897
Hey! Hey!
Stop the bus! Stop the bus!

01:30:59.974 --> 01:31:04.411
- We gotta get off!
- Ladies. You know the rules.

01:31:04.479 --> 01:31:06.640
We're not crazy, lady.

01:31:06.714 --> 01:31:08.614
We should've bought a squirrel.
We didn't buy a squirrel.

01:31:08.683 --> 01:31:11.311
- That's why we took the rocket car.
- We can still win.

01:31:11.385 --> 01:31:14.548
Open the door, or I'm gonna crush
you like a cockroach in the night.

01:31:14.622 --> 01:31:17.113
Open the door!
Tell him! Tell him!

01:31:17.191 --> 01:31:19.125
- Open the door.
- Thank you!

01:31:47.955 --> 01:31:49.252
It's Pollini.

01:31:49.357 --> 01:31:51.552
Enrico Pollini on a train.

01:31:51.659 --> 01:31:55.720
- He just rolled into the station.
- Well, what do you know?

01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:57.764
Rip Van Winkle
pulled it off.

01:31:57.865 --> 01:31:59.924
You gotta love a long shot.

01:32:24.458 --> 01:32:27.427
It's here. It's here.

01:32:27.528 --> 01:32:30.429
- It's here.
- Here he comes.

01:32:30.498 --> 01:32:32.864
- It's you.
- He's holding the key.

01:32:34.936 --> 01:32:37.200
And he's going
to the locker.

01:32:38.839 --> 01:32:42.400
Mr. Pollini, well done, sir.
And congratulations.

01:32:42.476 --> 01:32:45.673
On behalf of Mr. Donald Sinclair,
the Venetian Hotel and Casino--

01:32:51.786 --> 01:32:54.846
Mr. Grisham, is it over?

01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:03.663
- Get out of the way!
- Open it!

01:33:11.072 --> 01:33:13.006
He's sleeping.

01:33:33.127 --> 01:33:35.061
Did I win?

01:33:36.163 --> 01:33:38.222
Vicky.
You let go of this bag...

01:33:38.299 --> 01:33:41.826
or I swear to God, I'll report
you to the escort service.

01:33:41.902 --> 01:33:44.427
Mr. Grisham,
what's going on?

01:33:44.505 --> 01:33:48.339
The hooker-- The hooker--
The hookeris taking the money.

01:33:48.409 --> 01:33:52.106
- What hooker?
- Vicky. From the hotel.

01:33:52.179 --> 01:33:55.876
- Pepto-Bismol?
- I told you to wait in the car.

01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:58.544
- What the hell is she doing there?
- I brought her.

01:33:58.619 --> 01:34:02.214
I'm sorry, Mr. Sinclair.
She said she liked me.

01:34:02.323 --> 01:34:05.850
I'm beginning to think she was
only interested in the money!

01:34:10.564 --> 01:34:12.930
- Come with me.
- I'll drive.

01:34:27.181 --> 01:34:30.309
So long, suckers!

01:34:36.657 --> 01:34:39.626
- The bus! The bus.
- You wanna steal a bus?

01:34:39.727 --> 01:34:42.992
- Yes, I do.
- My God, what have I done?

01:34:44.799 --> 01:34:47.393
Help! Somebody help me!

01:34:49.804 --> 01:34:51.738
This thing's got
a mind of its own.

01:34:58.212 --> 01:35:00.680
- Finders keepers, pal.
- That's mine.

01:35:00.748 --> 01:35:03.012
I see it!
I see it! Relax!

01:35:15.963 --> 01:35:18.261
It means it's a scratch.
Nobody wins.

01:35:18.332 --> 01:35:22.098
I'll tell you what it means.
We're going into extra innings.

01:35:22.169 --> 01:35:25.195
Carla, call the airport. Tell them
to get my other Lear ready.

01:35:25.272 --> 01:35:28.298
Gordon, stay here and watch the
board. Tell us where they're going.

01:35:28.376 --> 01:35:32.335
Gentlemen, grab your drinks.
We're going to Silver City.

01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:44.724
- Is that it?
- That's it.

01:35:44.792 --> 01:35:46.987
Thank the pilot.
Tell him to level off.

01:35:48.462 --> 01:35:50.225
Who had Mr. Kimiche?

01:35:50.297 --> 01:35:52.600
- It was me.
- Well done!

01:35:52.733 --> 01:35:55.600
- Congratulations.
- Very good.

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:00.472
Keep going!

01:36:01.609 --> 01:36:03.600
Come on!

01:36:03.677 --> 01:36:06.202
There it is.
It's coming down right there.

01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:24.655
- Where is it?
- There it is.

01:36:24.732 --> 01:36:26.529
Go!

01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:33.028
- Get it! Get it!
- Grab that money!

01:36:33.107 --> 01:36:35.075
Get it down!

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.258
Now, that is
one hell of an entrance.

01:36:55.329 --> 01:36:57.160
It's Smash Mouth!

01:36:58.232 --> 01:37:00.996
What's going on over here?

01:37:01.068 --> 01:37:03.093
- What's this?
- Money.

01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:05.331
Jesus, how much is this?

01:37:05.406 --> 01:37:07.670
- Two million dollars.
- Two--

01:37:07.741 --> 01:37:11.768
Two million--
Two million dollars, everybody!

01:37:14.281 --> 01:37:16.408
Two million dollars!

01:37:16.517 --> 01:37:19.452
On the bus,
we talked about it...

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.388
and we decide
to share all the money.

01:37:24.391 --> 01:37:26.518
They're gonna share
all the money, everybody!

01:37:27.895 --> 01:37:29.385
Oh, man!

01:37:30.431 --> 01:37:32.058
Get these guys some jackets.

01:37:32.132 --> 01:37:34.566
Get these jack--
Get these jackets over here.

01:37:36.237 --> 01:37:39.434
So what's the story, man? Are you
guys some kind of organization?

01:37:39.507 --> 01:37:43.375
- What's going on?
- No, no. We just met this morning.

01:37:43.477 --> 01:37:46.446
They just met
this morning, everybody!

01:37:46.514 --> 01:37:48.004
Oh, my God!

01:37:48.115 --> 01:37:51.084
I almost didn't come along,
but then I met Tracy and--

01:37:51.185 --> 01:37:53.244
Well, great things
happen all at once.

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.778
Oh, this is beautiful, baby.
This is beautiful.

01:37:56.857 --> 01:37:59.155
Great things happen,
I don't know.

01:38:00.294 --> 01:38:02.228
Feed the earth, baby.
Feed the earth.

01:38:02.296 --> 01:38:06.289
We're gonna check the tote board
now and see where we're at. Okay?

01:38:06.367 --> 01:38:09.859
Come on, baby.
Let it roll. Come on, baby.

01:38:19.547 --> 01:38:20.912
You don't understand.

01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:30.919
Excuse me.
We work for Feed the Earth.

01:38:30.991 --> 01:38:32.822
These are some
of our children.

01:38:38.032 --> 01:38:41.866
I don't know who you people are
or where you came from...

01:38:41.936 --> 01:38:45.167
but God bless you.

01:38:47.374 --> 01:38:48.306
Tonight...

01:38:48.375 --> 01:38:50.935
you've given to these kids...

01:38:51.045 --> 01:38:56.142
and their brothers and sisters
all over the world more than money.

01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:59.014
You've given them back
their faith...

01:38:59.086 --> 01:39:02.487
their faith
in the goodness of people.

01:39:10.064 --> 01:39:15.263
She said, "You are just
like the 12 disciples."

01:39:16.937 --> 01:39:18.529
Aw!

01:39:21.942 --> 01:39:23.102
Aw!

01:39:24.578 --> 01:39:26.205
Thank you.

01:40:14.194 --> 01:40:16.128
Forget it.

01:40:16.196 --> 01:40:18.994
All these other disciples can do
whatever they want with their share.

01:40:19.066 --> 01:40:21.193
- But this money goes home with us.
- What?

01:40:21.268 --> 01:40:24.601
- Period. End of story.
- Put the money in the bag, carrot.

01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:32.101
You don't know me, man.

01:40:32.212 --> 01:40:34.146
Come here.

01:40:36.517 --> 01:40:38.451
It's you.

01:40:40.487 --> 01:40:42.648
I'm so proud of you.

01:40:42.723 --> 01:40:45.749
Giving away
all of your money?

01:40:57.304 --> 01:40:58.703
Come on.

01:41:07.448 --> 01:41:10.679
Mama is watching us
from heaven right now.

01:41:13.187 --> 01:41:15.212
What would she do?

01:41:19.059 --> 01:41:22.756
It's for starving
children, Duane.

01:41:24.965 --> 01:41:26.899
Do it for Mom.

01:41:51.925 --> 01:41:54.052
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:54.128 --> 01:41:56.528
I'd like to introduce
the real star of tonight's show.

01:41:56.597 --> 01:42:00.499
None of us would be here tonight
if it wasn't for this man.

01:42:00.567 --> 01:42:04.003
He is the man with the plan,
Mr. Donald Sinclair.

01:42:05.072 --> 01:42:06.004
What?

01:42:06.073 --> 01:42:08.837
One of the wealthiest
men in the world!

01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:13.504
- Mr. Donald Sinclair!
- You are the man.

01:42:13.614 --> 01:42:17.141
Get a camera on him. There you go.
Nice shot. There he is.

01:42:18.585 --> 01:42:21.816
These men, they didn't
have to be here tonight.

01:42:21.889 --> 01:42:24.323
No, they could be off
kicking back in the Riviera...

01:42:24.391 --> 01:42:27.883
or in Vegas blowing their money
on some meaningless idiotic bet.

01:42:29.763 --> 01:42:31.663
They couldn't do that...

01:42:31.732 --> 01:42:34.200
not when there were children
going to bed hungry every night.

01:42:34.268 --> 01:42:37.135
Isn't that right, fellas?

01:42:37.204 --> 01:42:39.138
Whatever.

01:42:39.206 --> 01:42:41.834
Mr. Donald Sinclair
and his partners...

01:42:41.909 --> 01:42:45.106
want you and the millions
of people watching at home...

01:42:45.212 --> 01:42:48.181
to know they plan to match
whatever you raise tonight...

01:42:48.248 --> 01:42:50.239
dollar for dollar!

01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:52.079
- Dollar for dollar!
- Dollar for dollar!

01:42:55.422 --> 01:42:57.083
A matching fund, everybody!

01:42:57.157 --> 01:42:59.591
Let's hit the phones
out there and crank it up...

01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:02.458
because we're gonna feed
the whole world tonight!

01:43:03.831 --> 01:43:06.231
Somebody once told me

01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.791
The world is gonna roll me

01:43:08.869 --> 01:43:12.669
I ain't the sharpest
toolin the shed

01:43:12.739 --> 01:43:15.173
And she was lookin'
kind of dumb

01:43:15.242 --> 01:43:17.233
With a finger and a thumb

01:43:17.344 --> 01:43:22.482
In the shape of an "L"
on her forehead

01:43:22.616 --> 01:43:24.982
Well, the years start comin'
and they don't stop comin'

01:43:25.052 --> 01:43:27.316
Fed to the rules and
I hit the ground runnin'

01:43:27.387 --> 01:43:29.355
Didn't make sense
not to live for fun

01:43:29.423 --> 01:43:31.891
Your brain gets smart
but your head gets dumb

01:43:31.959 --> 01:43:33.392
So much to do, so much to see

01:43:33.493 --> 01:43:36.155
So what's wrong with
takin' the backstreets

01:43:36.263 --> 01:43:38.094
You'll never know if you don't go

01:43:38.165 --> 01:43:40.326
You'll never shine if you don't glow

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:43.062
Hey, now, you're an all-star

01:43:43.136 --> 01:43:45.104
Get your game on, go play

01:43:45.172 --> 01:43:50.007
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

01:43:50.077 --> 01:43:53.012
All that glitters is gold

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:57.107
Only shooting stars
break the mold

01:43:58.652 --> 01:44:00.381
It's a cool place and
they say it gets colder

01:44:00.454 --> 01:44:02.854
You're bundled up now
Wait till you get older

01:44:02.923 --> 01:44:04.788
But the meteor men
beg to differ

01:44:04.892 --> 01:44:06.621
Judgin' by the hole
in the satellite picture

01:44:06.727 --> 01:44:08.888
The ice we skate
is gettin' pretty thin

01:44:08.996 --> 01:44:11.362
The water's gettin' warm
so you might as well swim

01:44:11.431 --> 01:44:13.729
My world's on fire
How about yours

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:16.701
That's the way I like it
and I'll never get bored

01:44:16.770 --> 01:44:20.729
Hey, now, you're an all-star
Get your game on, go play

01:44:20.807 --> 01:44:25.107
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

01:44:25.178 --> 01:44:28.409
All that glitters is gold

01:44:28.482 --> 01:44:34.250
Only shooting stars
break the mold

01:44:37.457 --> 01:44:39.823
Go to the moon

01:44:41.028 --> 01:44:44.088
Go to the moon

01:44:45.799 --> 01:44:48.461
Go to the moon

01:44:48.535 --> 01:44:52.096
Oh, yeah, go to the moon

01:44:52.172 --> 01:44:55.664
Hey, now, you're an all-star
Get your game on, go play

01:44:55.742 --> 01:45:00.236
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

01:45:00.314 --> 01:45:03.613
All that glitters is gold

01:45:03.684 --> 01:45:06.619
Only shooting stars

01:45:06.687 --> 01:45:11.317
Somebody once asked could
I spare some change for gas

01:45:11.391 --> 01:45:15.327
I need to get myself
away from this place

01:45:15.395 --> 01:45:16.953
I said yep, what a concept

01:45:17.064 --> 01:45:19.498
I could use
a little fuel myself

01:45:19.566 --> 01:45:24.265
And we all could use
a little change

01:45:24.338 --> 01:45:27.000
Well, the years start comin'
and they don't stop comin'

01:45:27.074 --> 01:45:28.439
Fed to the rules and
I hit the ground runnin'

01:45:28.508 --> 01:45:30.874
Didn't make sense
not to live for fun

01:45:30.944 --> 01:45:33.208
Your brain gets smart
but your head gets dumb

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.214
So much to do
So much to see

01:45:35.282 --> 01:45:37.443
So what's wrong with
takin' the backstreets

01:45:37.517 --> 01:45:38.950
You'll never know
if you don't go

01:45:39.019 --> 01:45:41.647
You'll never shine
if you don't glow

01:45:41.722 --> 01:45:45.453
Hey, now, you're an all-star
Get your game on, go play

01:45:45.559 --> 01:45:50.428
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

01:45:50.497 --> 01:45:53.432
All that glitters is gold

01:45:53.533 --> 01:45:58.664
Only shooting stars
break the mold

01:45:58.739 --> 01:46:02.300
All that glitters is gold

01:46:02.376 --> 01:46:09.305
Only shooting stars
