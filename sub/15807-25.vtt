00:03.871 --> 00:06.338
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.407 --> 00:08.473
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.542 --> 00:13.078
¶ That started from this tropic
port aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:13.147 --> 00:15.446
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.515 --> 00:17.716
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.785 --> 00:20.152
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.220 --> 00:22.187
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:22.256 --> 00:25.290
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:25.359 --> 00:27.325
[thunder rumbling]

00:27.394 --> 00:29.528
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.597 --> 00:31.730
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.798 --> 00:34.332
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.401 --> 00:36.568
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.637 --> 00:38.670
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.739 --> 00:40.772
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:40.841 --> 00:43.875
¶ Of this uncharted
      desert isle ¶

00:43.944 --> 00:46.177
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:46.246 --> 00:48.279
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:48.348 --> 00:50.582
¶ The millionaire ¶

00:50.651 --> 00:52.951
¶ And his wife ¶

00:53.020 --> 00:55.720
¶ The movie star ¶

00:55.789 --> 00:57.355
¶ And the rest ¶

00:57.424 --> 01:02.728
¶ Are here on Gilligan's Isle ¶

01:16.009 --> 01:17.975
[snoring]

01:18.044 --> 01:19.978
Dear, the opening of the opera

01:20.047 --> 01:23.182
the horse show,
two debutant balls.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.218
What the hell are you
           talking about?

01:27.287 --> 01:29.254
Oh, nothing, dear.
Go back to sleep.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.256
It's not your fault, anyway.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.292
Ah, ah, ah. Thank you.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.595
What's-what's
                   not my fault?

01:37.664 --> 01:40.398
Well, that we're sitting
out the entire social season

01:40.467 --> 01:42.600
on this silly little island.

01:42.669 --> 01:45.470
Well, you're actually right.
    It's-it's not my fault.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.472
I don't mind missing
the other things.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.476
But, Thurston,
the weddings. Oh!

01:52.779 --> 01:54.880
If there was just something
  I could do here

01:54.949 --> 01:58.283
like a charity ball
     or a benefit luncheon

01:58.352 --> 02:01.586
or-or making a perfect match.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.988
Chin up, Lovey.

02:03.057 --> 02:06.291
We won't be on this
  deary little island forever.

02:08.429 --> 02:13.698
Thurston, Thurston. Can't the
captain of a ship marry people?

02:13.767 --> 02:17.102
Yes, as a matter
      of fact he can. Why?

02:17.171 --> 02:18.904
Why didn't I think
              about that before?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.940
They're the most perfect match.
A little off beat of course.

02:22.008 --> 02:24.943
But then that's terribly chic
and it's the right season too.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.012
Lovey, what on earth
          are you talking about?

02:27.080 --> 02:30.649
Well, the wedding of course.
I have a thousand things to do.

02:30.718 --> 02:34.386
If I'm not asking too much,
     whose wedding?

02:44.831 --> 02:48.266
I don't understand, no one here,
but Gilligan and Mary Ann.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.904
Exactly.
               Romeo and Juliet.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.613
Nuptials between
Gilligan and Mary Ann.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.848
They're not even aware
of each other's existence.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.417
Of course they are, dear.
       Look at them out there.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.987
With some encouragement
    they could be madly in love.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.790
Gilligan, you should
have told me. You set that trap?

03:11.858 --> 03:14.592
- I might have broken a leg.
  - I'm sorry you fell in.

03:14.661 --> 03:17.228
- Here, let me rub it.
   - Oh, no, that's alright.

03:17.297 --> 03:20.031
- What were you trying to catch?
- An anteater.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.567
- An anteater? Whatever for?
  - For Ginger, the poor girl.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.070
You mean, she told you
to catch an anteater?

03:25.138 --> 03:26.471
No, the Skipper did.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.873
He said she had ants
in her belfry, whatever that is.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.643
So I tried to help
             her get rid of 'em.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.045
I'm sure the Skipper said
bats in her belfry.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.481
Bats?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.650
Where am I gonna
               find a bat eater?

03:39.819 --> 03:42.353
I don't even know
            what they look like.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.389
Gilligan and Mary Ann
haven't shown

03:44.457 --> 03:46.158
the slightest romantic
inclination towards each other.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.392
Of course not, dear.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.193
If they could manage
            on their own

03:49.262 --> 03:50.862
they wouldn't need me,
          would they?

03:50.931 --> 03:54.198
Lovey, I want you to stop
this ridiculous plan of action

03:54.267 --> 03:56.167
at once!

03:56.236 --> 03:59.103
Alright, darling,
               if you insist

03:59.172 --> 04:01.706
but it would be so easy.

04:01.774 --> 04:04.810
First we get them thinking
      about marriage in general.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.044
No!

04:06.112 --> 04:08.914
And then we get them
      thinking about each other.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.315
No.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.484
And get them thinking about

04:12.553 --> 04:15.587
the perfect marriage
            in the flesh.

04:15.655 --> 04:19.791
- That's us, dear.
  - No. I mean, yes, yes, us.

04:19.860 --> 04:24.562
It'd all be so easy. We'll let
  nature take its course.

04:24.631 --> 04:29.934
And then I'll work on Mary Ann
  and you work on Gilligan.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.437
No! I'll have no part of this

04:32.505 --> 04:35.173
cold blooded, nefarious,
female scheme.

04:35.242 --> 04:38.176
Yes, my boy, man doesn't
start living until

04:38.244 --> 04:40.378
after he is married.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.413
Mr. Howell, that must
           have cost a fortune.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.716
Everything I have costs
a fortune, Gilligan, my boy.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.084
Except this camera.
It costs more than a fortune.

04:47.153 --> 04:50.155
It's solid gold, it's custom
made, actually it's priceless.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.756
It's beautiful.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.893
It's true I like the finer
things in life and so could you.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.627
I never could
               be a millionaire.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.997
Ha ha, don't sell yourself
short, Gilligan.

04:59.065 --> 05:02.400
Do you think that I was always
healthy, handsome and wealthy?

05:02.468 --> 05:04.502
- Sure.
     - No, on the contrary.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.271
When I was a youth, I was pale,
sickly-looking inept

05:07.340 --> 05:08.840
rather like you, my boy.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.708
- You're kidding?
- Yes, I started to go downhill.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.478
And then I met Lovey
and that woman changed me.

05:13.546 --> 05:17.615
She took me and she hammered,
pounded, and molded me.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.884
- That must have hurt.
   - It's a figure of speech.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.953
Take the camera.
Take a picture of me

05:22.022 --> 05:24.255
next to this rather
rare plant for my album.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.857
Sure thing, Mr. Howell.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.927
Remember, behind every famous
man there stands a woman.

05:28.996 --> 05:33.632
Look at Napoleon and Josephine.
Look at Caesar and Cleopatra.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.233
Look where you are going,
   Gilligan!

05:36.302 --> 05:37.836
Oh, no.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.573
I think I got your picture.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.981
Have you ever seen
a grown man cry?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.650
Frightening sight.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.391
- They'll be awfully pretty.
  - Thank you, dear.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.793
Thurston loves
          these colorful ascots.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.062
You certainly like to please
him, don't you?

06:04.130 --> 06:06.263
It's all I live for.

06:06.332 --> 06:10.601
To be a good wife is to be
   a completely fulfilled woman.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.505
You'll find out yourself
        some day. I hope.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.540
I do too, I want
to get married.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.008
Of course,
                   you do, dear.

06:17.077 --> 06:22.480
Every girl at your age does,
    but time goes so fast.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.682
Yes, it does.
Doesn't it?

06:24.751 --> 06:26.985
We could be marooned
on this island for years.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.688
And years and years.

06:30.757 --> 06:35.059
Of course there are eligible
    bachelors right here.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.829
For me?
Well, who?

06:37.898 --> 06:40.031
I'm much too young
for the Skipper.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.967
The professor and I have
nothing in common.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.970
Gilligan, well..

06:47.507 --> 06:50.809
Gilligan?
      Gilligan, a husband?

06:53.446 --> 06:55.814
Flowers from Gilligan?
Are you sure?

06:55.882 --> 06:58.883
Of course, I was here
   when he put them on the bunk.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.853
- And he said they were for me?
- Uh-hm. Don't be so surprised.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.156
After all, you're a girl
        and he's..

07:04.224 --> 07:06.925
Well, whatever he is,
           he's kind of cute.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.493
Gee, I just..

07:08.562 --> 07:11.930
Imagine he's having a crush on
  you and we discovered it now.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.699
It reminds me of a movie
        I was in once.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.835
He loved her with
              a burning passion.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.170
And she loved him
            like a flaming fire.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.672
It was a good movie.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.974
Sounds more like a commercial
for a gas company.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.944
Hi, girls. I wanted to see if
 you got the flowers, Mary Ann.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.981
See, I told you. Why didn't
     you say something to him?

07:30.049 --> 07:32.616
- I didn't know what to say.
  - Just be sweet to him.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.286
I mean he's a shy
               frightened fawn.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.354
Just like in the movies.

07:37.423 --> 07:38.857
See you.

07:40.359 --> 07:42.894
Flowers from Gilligan.

07:42.962 --> 07:48.166
Gilligan, I-I just wanna say,
 don't be fooled by appearances.

07:48.234 --> 07:49.967
- Okay?
            - Okay.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.669
What I mean is

07:51.738 --> 07:54.638
sometimes a person
      can't show what they feel.

07:54.707 --> 07:57.475
- Do you know what I mean?
   - Nope.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.343
Gilligan, try to understand.

07:59.412 --> 08:02.280
Sometimes a certain girl feels
 the same way as certain fellow

08:02.349 --> 08:06.383
feels about her,
  but she just can't show it.

08:06.452 --> 08:07.752
Get it?

08:09.422 --> 08:10.988
Oh!

08:11.057 --> 08:12.456
Oh, oh.

08:12.525 --> 08:15.059
I just felt I should
      say something.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.661
Oh, I'm glad you didn't.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.263
I'm glad you like me
     as much as I like you.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.366
I'll tell you what, don't
  you worry about your belfry.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.169
I'll find you that bat eater.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.238
Belfry?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.475
Well, our little buddy here is
 becoming quite a social lad.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.278
Yes, how come he gets a special
 invitation to the Howells.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.346
Mrs. Howell wanna thank me
   for helping her.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.416
She picked flowers and had
   me give 'em to Mary Ann.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.217
Had you give them
to Mary Ann?

08:40.285 --> 08:43.020
She wanted to thank Mary Ann
  for helping with the sewing.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.090
- Was there a note?
     - I don't think. Why?

08:45.158 --> 08:48.359
Well, you left the flowers
for Mary Ann without a note.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.960
She'll think
you gave them to her.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.964
Why would she think that?
She didn't help me with sewing.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.734
Gilligan, your innocence is
  exceeded only by your naivety.

08:55.802 --> 08:59.604
You left yourself wide open for
a dilly of misunderstanding.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.539
Many men have been brought
      to their knees

09:01.607 --> 09:03.341
by lot less than
                flowers. Right?

09:03.410 --> 09:04.876
Oh, right, Professor.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.845
Did you notice the way Mary Ann
kept passing him the toast?

09:07.914 --> 09:11.082
And yesterday it was the coconut
milk. Highly indicative.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.117
I want to tell you
there's no telling

09:13.186 --> 09:14.919
what's playing around
that pretty little head.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.221
What you're trying to put
   me on won't work.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.958
Mary Ann doesn't have
  a crush on me. Ginger does.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.563
Oh, Gilligan,
   come and take this chair.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.631
It's the most
comfortable.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.200
Thank you for
      inviting me tonight.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.003
It's the least we could do
     for your help this morning.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.071
But I broke your priceless,
  solid gold camera.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.106
Yes, you did.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.274
[knock on door]

09:36.343 --> 09:39.177
Oh, there's someone
     at the door. Come in.

09:40.613 --> 09:44.048
Oh, Mary Ann.
What a surprise!

09:44.116 --> 09:46.884
- It is? You did ask me over.
 - Oh, yes, of course.

09:46.953 --> 09:49.087
Gilligan dropped in too.
    Isn't that nice?

09:49.155 --> 09:51.089
- Hi, Gilligan.
        - Hi, Mary Ann.

09:51.158 --> 09:55.426
Ah, now isn't this cozy?
        Sit right down here.

09:55.495 --> 09:58.496
Thurston, haven't we got some
champagne cooling in the stream.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.631
One of our
last bottles.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.734
Oh, marvelous!
         We must get it at once.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.171
Now you two children
            sit there and chat.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.305
We'll be right back.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.873
[blowing]

10:19.486 --> 10:21.653
Ah-huh.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.995
Something bothering you,
Mary Ann?

10:31.064 --> 10:33.832
Oh, no. No, Gilligan. I..

10:35.202 --> 10:38.136
Well, I do want to thank you
    for the flowers.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.705
Oh, I didn't give you those
flowers, Mrs. Howell did.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.340
Mrs. Howell?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.778
- Ginger said you left them.
  - I did, for Mrs. Howell.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.883
Oh, I guess I just..

10:52.985 --> 10:54.919
Oh, I thought maybe..

10:58.257 --> 11:00.357
Oh.

11:00.426 --> 11:04.195
Then you mean that
   you and, uh, Ginger was..

11:07.400 --> 11:09.134
The guys were right.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.569
I guess it was a little
         misunderstanding, huh?

11:11.638 --> 11:15.840
Yeah, I guess..
Tell you what, Mary Ann.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.042
I'd spend all morning
  picking flowers for someone

11:18.111 --> 11:20.778
I-I'd certainly pick
those flowers for someone

11:20.847 --> 11:23.314
as sweet and nice
as you are.

11:23.382 --> 11:26.918
Oh. That's an awfully
   sweet thing to say, Gilligan.

11:26.987 --> 11:31.089
Well, it's awfully sweet thing
of you to think that, hm.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.090
I'm not half
                as sweet as you.

11:33.159 --> 11:36.460
Well, I'm not..
You are twice as sweet as me.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.896
Heavens, what a conversation.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.399
Things are going
                swimmingly.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.301
They're getting sweet on each
other, I'll say that much.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.472
Thurston, let's show them
       what real happiness is.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.544
Well, here we are. Will you do
 the honors, sweetheart?

11:53.612 --> 11:55.112
Yes, delighted my pet.

11:55.181 --> 11:58.182
Gilligan, could we have a little
light on the subject, please?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.984
Here we are.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.620
I'm gonna tell
you children the secret.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.990
This is sort of a celebration.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.891
Twenty years ago tonight

12:07.960 --> 12:10.461
Mr. Howell proposed to me
and I accepted.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.331
Aw, how beautifully romantic.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.532
Thurston always had
      a knack for romance.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.835
He took me to the most
  enchanting little restaurant

12:17.903 --> 12:19.570
The <i> Tour d'Argent.</i>

12:19.639 --> 12:21.138
Do you remember, sweetheart?

12:21.207 --> 12:23.774
Well, how could I forget
 a prime bid of income property

12:23.843 --> 12:25.977
on West 47th Street.

12:26.045 --> 12:29.046
- It was on 52nd street, dear.
 - No, no, dear.

12:29.115 --> 12:33.217
West 47th Street
 and we had <i> pate de foie gras.</i>

12:33.286 --> 12:37.688
Uh, Thurston, dear, we were
  having pheasant under glass.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.091
His memory isn't quite
what it was.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.393
Yes, well, of course,
   what difference does it make?

12:42.462 --> 12:46.197
Anyhow, here's to 20 years
      of wedded bliss.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.069
Bad year.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.637
Here's to the most devoted

12:52.706 --> 12:54.638
considerate husband
in the world.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.141
Here, I'll drink to that.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.476
Here's to Lovey
     who looks as lovely tonight

12:59.545 --> 13:01.579
as she did 20 years ago.

13:01.647 --> 13:04.549
May I say, 20 years ago
     what a vision of loveliness

13:04.617 --> 13:07.051
she was sitting there
         in a flaming red dress.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.920
Flaming red dress? I never
  had a red dress in my life!

13:09.989 --> 13:11.422
You must have rented it

13:11.491 --> 13:14.025
because that's what
     you had on that night.

13:14.094 --> 13:17.061
Thurston, you must be
   remembering somebody else.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.363
No. I can see her
       in that red dress

13:19.432 --> 13:21.365
sitting there,
      clicking her nails.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.201
Clicking my nails?

13:24.270 --> 13:27.905
Yes, it's a nervous habit
  she has, clicking her nails.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.908
Oh, shall we make
               another toast?

13:29.976 --> 13:32.677
Yeah. Here is to 20 years
of harmony and bliss.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.778
If I click my nails,
it's only to drown

13:34.847 --> 13:36.347
out the noise
of his sniffing.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.983
- I beg your pardon?
     - I said, "sniffing."

13:40.052 --> 13:41.986
Twenty years of it!

13:42.055 --> 13:44.055
Well, I hadn't known
    it bothered you before.

13:44.123 --> 13:47.659
It doesn't, not nearly
so much as his throat clearing.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.460
We haven't spoke
                of that before.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.928
[clearing throat]

13:50.997 --> 13:52.964
Just as I never spoke
     of your snoring.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.465
My snoring?

13:54.533 --> 13:58.536
- How dare you say such a thing.
- It took nerve.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.870
Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell..

13:59.939 --> 14:01.772
Oh, what vulgarity!

14:01.841 --> 14:03.507
But what I can expect of man

14:03.576 --> 14:05.008
who doesn't know
     the difference between

14:05.077 --> 14:06.844
his oyster fork
       and a shrimp fork?

14:06.913 --> 14:08.646
That's gone far enough.

14:08.715 --> 14:09.913
I won't go any farther

14:09.982 --> 14:11.950
because I shall
never speak to you again.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.586
As long as we have witnesses,
 you mind putting it in writing.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.988
- Do something.
        - Um, yeah.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.491
Here's to a perfect marriage.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.672
I heard there's a popular saying
for who has had it.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.974
I want you gentlemen
     to clear space for me

14:37.043 --> 14:38.676
and I'll list my simple
    requirement.

14:38.744 --> 14:41.012
First of all, tea at seven.
  Gilligan, you're caddy.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.948
Skipper, I want you to rinse out
and wash that luggage.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.352
That beast of a man can go
   where he chooses.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.654
I'm not staying alone.
     Be a darling, help me.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.024
I left my hair dryer outside.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.195
Well, here we are,
      one big happy family

14:58.264 --> 15:00.631
having our happy midday meal.

15:00.699 --> 15:03.167
Yes, it certainly is
      a beautiful day, isn't it?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.902
It's a lovely day.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.704
Don't you think so,
             Mrs. Howell?

15:06.773 --> 15:08.573
Might I have
    the coconut milk please?

15:08.641 --> 15:10.575
[coughing]

15:12.111 --> 15:14.612
I don't think I could
    be heard over the noise

15:14.681 --> 15:16.747
at the far end of the table

15:16.816 --> 15:19.250
'Ginger, would you please pass
 the coconut milk?'

15:19.319 --> 15:20.518
Sure.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.954
Gilligan, would you ask
         the lady who sits there

15:23.022 --> 15:26.623
clicking like a parking meter
 if she's through with the salt?

15:26.692 --> 15:29.794
Your husband for 20 years would
like you to pass the salt.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.930
Tell that gentlemen
   with the nasal disturbance

15:32.998 --> 15:35.934
that I have not finished.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.302
Why don't you two
     stop this foolishness?

15:38.370 --> 15:40.771
Yes, your disagreement really
has no basis, you know.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.574
What's a few insults when you've
been married for 20 years?

15:43.643 --> 15:46.210
Besides whether they even were
insults is highly debatable.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.245
Are you kidding?
        He said that she snored.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.581
You can hardly call that
an insult, could you?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.049
Well, I would.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.385
Don't you think
that's a bit immature?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.720
No, I think it's an insult.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.890
Perhaps that proves
my point.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.258
Well, aren't we
                 the smart one?

16:01.327 --> 16:03.828
I needn't take
that tone of voice.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.996
Frankly, I don't blame
     her a bit.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.333
Excuse me, I'm gonna finish
my meal elsewhere.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.637
All this is because Mr. Howell
can't remember anything?

16:13.706 --> 16:16.073
I can remember everything.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.343
Be quiet, Gilligan.
You're just making things worse.

16:19.411 --> 16:22.146
Don't blame him, after all
   it was you who started it.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.315
- Says who?
          - Says me.

16:24.384 --> 16:28.119
- Well, say it to yourself.
  - I certainly will.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.490
Gilligan, come with me.

16:32.558 --> 16:33.824
I haven't finished.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.960
Gilligan, come with me.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.195
I'm finished.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.201
Gilligan, we've got
           a red light emergency

16:44.270 --> 16:47.271
and we've got to nip it
    right in the bud, right now.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.273
- Or nobody will be talking.
  - Exactly.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.774
How did it all start?

16:50.843 --> 16:53.344
Let's see, the Professor
said to Ginger, "I'd like to--"

16:53.413 --> 16:57.215
No, I mean with the Howells.
    How did it start?

16:57.283 --> 17:00.751
Mrs. Howell asked Mr. Howell
for the coconut milk and--

17:00.820 --> 17:02.620
I know this is hard for you

17:02.688 --> 17:04.955
but do you remember
       clear back to last night?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.790
- Can you do that?
       - I'll do my best.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.727
- Morale of the group is on you.
- Aye aye, sir.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.699
What were the Howells doing
  when they started their fight?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.768
They were showing Mary Ann
and me how happy they were.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.069
- No, no, no.
        - Yes, yes, yes.

17:20.138 --> 17:21.872
Because they were
celebrating the anniversary

17:21.941 --> 17:25.442
of Mr. Howell's proposal to
Mrs. Howell in the <i> Tour d'Argent</i>

17:25.511 --> 17:27.944
on 47th street.
I remember it all.

17:28.013 --> 17:32.016
Right, she was trying to make
   everything so romantic.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.851
That's our answer.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.853
Ginger, have you been to this
 place, the <i> Tour d'Argent?</i>

17:36.922 --> 17:40.458
I've been to the <i> Tour d'Argent.</i>
 It's very romantic.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.460
Well, then, we will recreate
    the place as best we can.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.729
We'll get the Howells there,
  in some sort of a pretext.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.731
We'll set them up
      with fond memories.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.334
- That should get them together.
- That's a wonderful idea.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.369
- I'll be the entertainer.
   - I'll be the chef.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.939
Can I be the bus boy
with a white jacket?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.640
You can be the waiter.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.109
Let's proceed with
   operation reconciliation.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.511
Come on.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.450
Well, this is more like it.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.153
One big happy family again.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.155
We'll have a little
run through.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.457
Ginger, would you be
Mrs. Howell?

18:13.525 --> 18:14.725
Yes.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.627
I'll be Mr. Howell.

18:17.563 --> 18:21.131
Ah-h.
Are you ready, Gilligan?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.100
After you, peer.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.369
- What?
- I heard that in a movie once.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.209
Watch this, Skipper.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.879
- Soup,<i> madame?</i>
    - Very good, thank you.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.881
Here we go.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.519
- There.
 - That's very good, Gilligan.

18:41.588 --> 18:45.155
But there's one thing.
          Relax and bow lower.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.258
- Oh.
       - Soup,<i> monsieur?</i>

18:53.766 --> 18:56.234
- See you tonight, girls.
   - Okay, see you.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.237
Gilligan, Gilligan.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.740
Remember tonight, we're trying
 to bring back

19:03.809 --> 19:05.676
romantic memories
for the Howells, right?

19:05.744 --> 19:06.777
Right, Skipper.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.346
And for our plan to work
we've got to make

19:09.415 --> 19:12.316
a perfect duplicate of that
perfect evening 20 years ago.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.984
- Right, Skipper.
       - Right.

19:14.053 --> 19:17.221
Now, please don't spill the soup
on the Howells tonight.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.056
You can depend
                 on me, Skipper.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.625
Thanks, buddy.
Come on.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.827
If you could just come
this way,<i> monsieur.</i>

19:23.896 --> 19:26.364
You might let me in on these
    play-acting shenanigans

19:26.432 --> 19:29.834
as long as
you're using my abode.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.635
Thank you.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.472
- Your menu,<i> monsieur.</i>
     - Menu?

19:34.541 --> 19:36.740
Oh, what on earth
               is going on here?

19:36.809 --> 19:39.843
A-ha, just as I suspected.
Collusion.

19:39.912 --> 19:43.181
A little surprise, Mrs. Howell.
Come here.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.921
We've prepared a very
         special dinner for you.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.223
In that case you might
     have selected a more

19:53.292 --> 19:55.626
congenial partner for me.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.897
At least she's
       sitting with him.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.365
Gilligan.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.601
Good evening and welcome
        to the <i> Tour d'Argent.</i>

20:04.670 --> 20:08.538
-<i> Tour d'Argent?</i>
 - Just as I thought. Collusion.

20:08.607 --> 20:11.041
And now ladies and gentlemen,
 from the <i> Tour d'Argent</i>

20:11.110 --> 20:13.444
in the heart of glamorous
   West 47th Street--

20:13.513 --> 20:15.313
West 52nd Street.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.615
We are happy to present
         the one and only

20:17.683 --> 20:20.483
the incomparable
          <i> mademoiselle,</i> Ginger.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.787
[slow instrumental music]

20:30.362 --> 20:32.763
[singing in French]

20:54.486 --> 20:56.921
- Lovely voice?
        - Yes.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.859
Hold my hand,
              Thurston, darling.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.767
[continues singing]

21:50.576 --> 21:52.076
[all clapping]

21:56.782 --> 21:59.816
Flowers. Would you like
a corsage for <i> madame, monsieur?</i>

21:59.885 --> 22:03.787
Yes, I would very much.
Here you are, my dear.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.623
- Keep the change.
       <i> - Merci.</i>

22:06.692 --> 22:08.626
So, there you are, my darling.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.662
Oh, Thurston, for me?

22:11.731 --> 22:14.531
Well, the little thing
has to make a living.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.534
Darling, you're always
          so generous.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.070
They're smiling.
When do I get my turn?

22:20.138 --> 22:21.538
Right away, Gilligan.

22:21.607 --> 22:25.575
Little alcohol on these
    turtle tit bits and <i> presto..</i>

22:25.644 --> 22:27.778
...flaming <i> hors d'oeuvres.</i>

22:27.847 --> 22:30.547
- Howells are gonna eat these?
 - Of course.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.716
No wonder they made good.
Nothing scares them.

22:32.784 --> 22:36.687
Gilligan, you put the fire out
  before you serve them.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.956
- Gilligan--
- Don't worry, I'll be careful.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.391
Thank you.

22:46.098 --> 22:49.467
Here you are.
    Nice flaming <i> hors d'oeuvres.</i>

22:51.737 --> 22:54.805
Gilligan, what are you doing?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.475
Oh, Gilligan.
       Allow me,<i> madame.</i>

23:04.249 --> 23:05.950
Show off.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.685
Yes.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.789
Now comes your moment
of truth, little buddy.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.725
Be of good cheer, Skipper.

23:14.794 --> 23:18.429
I will not spill
        the soup on the Howells.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.933
And now ladies and gentlemen
  for her second number

23:23.001 --> 23:25.936
Ginger will present a dance
  she created in her film

23:26.005 --> 23:28.438
"The Hula Girl
       and the Fullback."

23:28.507 --> 23:30.641
[Hawaiian music]

24:06.111 --> 24:07.377
No!

24:07.446 --> 24:08.913
[music stops]

24:11.684 --> 24:14.452
Why me, Professor,
              always me?

24:21.193 --> 24:25.029
I wish some other couple could
know the joys of wedded bliss.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.963
Oh, no, no. Not again.

24:27.032 --> 24:30.601
- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Howell.
   - Lovely day, isn't it?

24:30.669 --> 24:34.605
- Thank heavens.
 - I wasn't talking about them.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.741
Oh, good grief.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.745
Marvelous combination
and it's the right season too.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.448
- Oh, Ginger, Professor.
   - Lovey, Lovey, we can't.

24:45.517 --> 24:49.720
Ah, no, not again.
       Not again.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.823
Lovey, baby.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.167
¶ Now, this is the tale
    of the castaways ¶

25:04.236 --> 25:05.869
¶ They're here for
      a long, long time ¶

25:05.938 --> 25:08.371
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:08.440 --> 25:10.040
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:10.109 --> 25:12.342
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:12.411 --> 25:14.178
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:14.246 --> 25:16.646
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:16.715 --> 25:18.882
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:18.951 --> 25:21.184
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcars ¶

25:21.253 --> 25:22.886
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:22.955 --> 25:25.289
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:25.358 --> 25:27.024
¶ Its primitive as can be ¶

25:27.092 --> 25:29.793
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:29.861 --> 25:31.862
You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:31.931 --> 25:34.064
¶ From seven stranded
     castaways ¶

25:34.133 --> 25:36.200
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶

25:37.305 --> 25:43.238
