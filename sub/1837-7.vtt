(<i>snorts </i>)

00:11.767 --> 00:13.500
Check out
Horace, y'all.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.367
Looks like he
was just beamed down

00:15.367 --> 00:16.700
from Planet Dweeb.

00:16.700 --> 00:20.300
It's official, there's no
mirrors in outer space.

00:20.300 --> 00:22.300
Excuse me,
but I think it is wrong

00:22.300 --> 00:25.500
to judge a man based on
the color of his space suit.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.734
Hey, Rae.

00:28.734 --> 00:30.367
Hi, Devon.

00:30.367 --> 00:32.400
BOTH:
Hi, Devon.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.200
Come on, let's go.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.567
Hey, did you check out

00:38.567 --> 00:39.834
Horace's outfit?

00:39.834 --> 00:41.100
Isn't that just wrong?

00:41.100 --> 00:42.600
Tell me about it!

00:42.600 --> 00:45.300
He has his transporter belt
on backwards.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.667
His transporter...

00:49.567 --> 00:50.667
And, uh...

00:50.667 --> 00:52.700
you know this why?

00:52.700 --> 00:55.233
I mean, come on, he's wearing
a star commander uniform,

00:55.233 --> 00:56.567
from<i>Astro Force 5.</i>

00:56.567 --> 00:57.767
The TV show?

00:57.767 --> 00:59.233
Hey, Devon,

00:59.233 --> 01:01.867
you psyched about the AFF
convention this weekend?
You know it.

01:03.467 --> 01:05.367
Wait a second, wait.

01:05.367 --> 01:06.867
Devon, you're...

01:06.867 --> 01:08.800
you're one of these?

01:08.800 --> 01:10.133
Yeah.

01:10.133 --> 01:13.367
I'm a Forcie, I mean,
it's my favorite show.

01:13.367 --> 01:14.500
Are you into it?

01:14.500 --> 01:15.934
Into it?

01:15.934 --> 01:19.600
Boy, please, I am into it,
around it, and all up in it.

01:20.567 --> 01:22.400
Cool. What's your
favorite episode?

01:22.400 --> 01:24.200
Oh...

01:24.200 --> 01:25.767
Horace, okay.

01:25.767 --> 01:28.200
Um, it would have to be
the one where...

01:28.200 --> 01:30.300
they, they went
to some planet,

01:30.300 --> 01:31.600
right, right?

01:31.600 --> 01:33.000
And, uh...

01:33.000 --> 01:36.100
they had some problems.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.834
Right, Episode 65.

01:37.834 --> 01:40.867
BOTH:
"Planet of the Problems!"

01:40.867 --> 01:42.834
Yeah, yeah.
Impressive.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.600
Look, I got
an extra ticket

01:44.600 --> 01:46.767
to the convention,
if you want to go?

01:46.767 --> 01:49.233
Oh, I don't know
what to say, Devon.

01:49.233 --> 01:52.500
How about "Astro Blasto?"

01:52.500 --> 01:53.667

02:52.100 --> 02:54.100
for your
<i>Astro Force 5 </i>quiz?

02:54.100 --> 02:56.000
Bring it on,
my solar sister.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.100
What is the Clawezean word
for space destroyer?

02:59.100 --> 03:00.600
Girl, I know this one.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.600
Ready?
Yes.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.967
(<i>clicking twice </i>):
Edic!

03:02.967 --> 03:04.467
Close, but, uh, no,

03:04.467 --> 03:06.767
that's Langolian for ketchup,
as in please pass the Edic!

03:06.767 --> 03:07.834
(<i>clicks twice </i>)

03:07.834 --> 03:09.400
This is ridiculous,

03:09.400 --> 03:12.300
I don't even watch
the stupid show.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.934
Why did I lie to Devon?

03:13.934 --> 03:15.500
He's never lied to me.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.133
Y'all still checking out
this nerd site?

03:18.133 --> 03:20.867
Oh, now that is
Astro Force Fine right there.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.100
That's Curvacia,
she's the space nurse.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.367
What planet is she from?

03:24.367 --> 03:25.867
'Cause I'm moving there.

03:25.867 --> 03:28.767
She's going to be at the
convention tomorrow,
signing pictures.

03:28.767 --> 03:31.033
I have got to get into that
convention, Chels.

03:31.033 --> 03:32.900
I got to get out of it.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.300
Good luck, Rae. You keep your...

03:35.300 --> 03:37.600
(<i>clicking and beeping </i>) up.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.567
I hope that means chin.

03:40.567 --> 03:42.767
Cory, I'm freaking out.

03:42.767 --> 03:44.600
William,
just calm down.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.000
We'll find him.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.600
William's rabbit is missing?

03:48.600 --> 03:51.834
Yeah, Einstein got out again.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.767
It'll be okay.

03:53.767 --> 03:57.000
I mean, he probably just went
out for a bunch of carrots.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.300
I found him.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.600
Um, hey, Cory,

04:07.600 --> 04:09.600
tell William to look
under his pillow.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.500
He lost a rabbit...
not a tooth.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.233
No, Cory, I had a vision.

04:15.233 --> 04:17.367
That's where Einstein is hiding.

04:17.367 --> 04:19.734
Check under
your pillow.

04:21.467 --> 04:22.500
I found him!

04:22.500 --> 04:24.300
He was right where you said.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.967
How'd you know?

04:25.967 --> 04:28.400
He wants to know how I knew.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.133
You better not tell him
I'm psychic.

04:30.133 --> 04:31.834
Got it.

04:31.834 --> 04:34.467
William...

04:34.467 --> 04:36.033
I'm psychic.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.100
(<i>knocking </i>)

04:49.200 --> 04:51.500
Cory, you have a gift.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.367
It's not my birthday,
but thanks.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.500
I'm talking about

04:55.500 --> 04:57.767
your psychic connection
to animals.

04:57.767 --> 04:59.900
So, I don't get
to keep the turtle?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.467
It's Larry's turtle.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.400
I'm so worried about him,

05:03.400 --> 05:06.567
he hardly comes out
of his shell anymore.

05:06.567 --> 05:10.200
Listen, William,
about finding your rabbit,

05:10.200 --> 05:12.500
it was just kind of a hunch.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.367
I'll give
you five dollars.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.967
Well, step into my office, then.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.967
So, Larry, what's
your turtle's name?

05:22.967 --> 05:24.400
Larry.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm getting something.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.100
Larry's upset because...

05:33.767 --> 05:37.600
he doesn't have
his own identity.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.000
He'd like a new name.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.767
Okay, uh...

05:42.767 --> 05:45.700
How about Steve?

05:48.100 --> 05:49.934
He likes Steve.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.834
Steve is good.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.600
My brother Steve is going
to be so excited.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.000
Thanks, Cory.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.867
Come on, Steve.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.900
William, I'm thinking

06:05.900 --> 06:07.300
there's
a lot of kids

06:07.300 --> 06:09.900
out there
with animal problems.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.500
Who just got their allowance.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.100
Oh, hey, Rae.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.800
Oh, hey, Devon.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.100
This is for you.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.667
Oh, a silver rose.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.200
Remember, Episode 317?

06:31.200 --> 06:32.600
Oh, um...

06:32.600 --> 06:35.867
"Planet of the Silver Roses."

06:37.100 --> 06:38.567
No, "Asteroid of Love."

06:38.567 --> 06:40.367
You know, when Captain Stone

06:40.367 --> 06:43.200
met the most beautiful girl
in the universe?

06:43.200 --> 06:46.567
Oh, Devon.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.700
I have to be honest with you.

06:49.934 --> 06:52.400
I'm not into<i>Astro Force 5.</i>

06:54.000 --> 06:55.667
Then why'd you say you were?

06:55.667 --> 06:58.100
Because, you loved it so much
I wanted to love it, too.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.600
Rae, Rae, you know what I love?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.200
I love for us

07:02.200 --> 07:04.300
to be honest
with each other.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.600
Me, too.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.100
So is it okay if I don't go

07:07.100 --> 07:08.667
to the convention with you?

07:08.667 --> 07:10.367
Sure.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.233
Is it okay if I give
your ticket away?

07:12.233 --> 07:15.834
As long as it puts a smile
on my little Forcie's face.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.033
Hey, uh, Phoebe!

07:20.200 --> 07:21.600
Got your ticket for you.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Phoebe?

07:29.934 --> 07:31.967
All the little
Forcies over here

07:31.967 --> 07:33.667
and you had to pick her?

07:34.834 --> 07:37.600
Rae, you're not jealous,
are you?

07:39.600 --> 07:41.200
Of course not.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.500
So you trust me, right?

07:43.500 --> 07:44.967
Absolutely.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.300
Cool. You're the best, Rae.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.200
Thank you.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.100
Hey, Rae, you work things
out with Devon yet?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.500
Yeah, actually I told him
he could give away my ticket.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.200
Oh, cool, now you
don't have to go

08:00.200 --> 08:01.867
to that stupid space convention.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.700
Rae, what's wrong, are you okay?

08:13.700 --> 08:17.767
Yeah, but, Chels, we've got
to go to that stupid convention.

08:19.100 --> 08:22.700
No little space nasty
is going to steal my man.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.233
Uh-huh. There's
Devon and Phoebe.

08:41.233 --> 08:43.133
It really doesn't
look like anything

08:43.133 --> 08:44.800
is going on
between them, Rae.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.367
Not yet, Chels,
but trust me,

08:46.367 --> 08:48.200
she's got nuzzling
on her mind.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.667
We have to get in there.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.367
Aw, man.

08:52.367 --> 08:54.300
Every nerd in town is here!

08:54.300 --> 08:55.400
Tickets? Tickets!

08:55.400 --> 08:57.100
I need them tickets,
I need them quick.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.500
Eddie,
what are you doing here?

08:58.500 --> 09:01.100
I have got to get in there
and see Curvacia.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.734
I mean, look at her, Chels.

09:02.734 --> 09:03.900
She's perfect.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.500
Anyway, never mind me,

09:05.500 --> 09:07.200
what are you two doing here?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.967
Oh, Raven is here
spying on Devon,

09:08.967 --> 09:12.200
but don't tell anyone because
it would really ruin our plans.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.800
Oh, those are really cute.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.367
Rae, why are you
spying on Devon?

09:17.367 --> 09:19.200
I thought everything
was solid, girl.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.467
Yeah, yes it is.
You know, I trust him.

09:21.467 --> 09:23.700
It's just that,
Eddie, I had this vision

09:23.700 --> 09:26.767
that he was with Phoebe
and Phoebe was looking cute.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.600
She was nuzzling all up on him.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.000
Tickets, people, I need tickets!

09:34.000 --> 09:35.100
She about to nuzzle him!

09:35.100 --> 09:36.500
Please, people, I need tickets!

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
Please, sir, please.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.000
Hey, look at my glasses,
cool, huh?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.100
Chels will you focus please?

09:40.100 --> 09:41.667
We are trying
to get a ticket here.

09:41.667 --> 09:42.934
Okay, Rae, listen,

09:42.934 --> 09:45.100
unless one of us
is actually on
<i>Astro Force 5,</i>

09:45.100 --> 09:46.567
it's not going to happen.

09:48.867 --> 09:50.100
Chels, don't move.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.734
What, what, what
is it a bug?

09:51.734 --> 09:53.200
Get it off.
Get it off, Rae.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.700
Oh, but don't
kill it, okay?

09:54.700 --> 09:55.767
No, Chels, it's not a bug.

09:55.767 --> 09:58.200
You look exactly
like Princess Juliana.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.100
That's right, Rae,
they'd let her in.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.233
We're with her.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.767
Okay, so my hair is like
totally different

10:04.767 --> 10:06.700
and I have two eyebrows.

10:06.700 --> 10:10.033
Not when I
get done with you.

10:10.033 --> 10:12.400
Rae, which one are you
going to take?

10:18.934 --> 10:21.934
(various animal noises)

10:25.934 --> 10:27.734
You're doing a wonderful thing

10:27.734 --> 10:30.200
using your psychic powers
to help people

10:30.200 --> 10:31.667
with their pet problems.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.100
Yeah, yeah.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.300
Just don't forget
to collect that money.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.300
Next!

10:41.567 --> 10:42.967
Jenny's snake

10:42.967 --> 10:45.767
won't come out
from under the rock.

10:49.834 --> 10:51.300
Move the rock.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.033
Next!

10:57.200 --> 10:59.567
Why does it smell
like a zoo in here?

11:03.600 --> 11:05.900
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Baxter.

11:05.900 --> 11:09.100
Would you happen to have
a very large pooper-scooper?

11:09.100 --> 11:12.100
William, what is
going on in here?

11:12.100 --> 11:13.834
You may not
be aware of this,

11:13.834 --> 11:16.133
but you have
a psychic in the family.

11:17.233 --> 11:19.133
We do?

11:19.133 --> 11:21.934
Cory is
amazingly gifted.

11:21.934 --> 11:23.400
Cory?

11:23.400 --> 11:26.200
Yes. He knows what
animals are thinking.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.233
Wait. Don't tell me.

11:28.233 --> 11:30.900
I bet he's charging money
for his services.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.500
Are you psychic, too?

11:32.500 --> 11:35.700
No. I'm just his dad.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.800
Look, William,
why don't you go home?

11:37.800 --> 11:39.233
We'll take care of this.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.834
Actually, don't
leave just yet.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.300
I have an idea,

11:43.300 --> 11:46.200
and I'm going to
need some brainpower.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.200
Make way!

11:54.200 --> 11:56.200
Princess posse's
coming through.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.033
I know we fooled the guards,
but these people are huge fans.

11:59.033 --> 12:02.100
They're not going to actually
believe I'm Princess Juliana.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.567
All hail the Princess!

12:04.567 --> 12:06.767
All hail to the Princess!

12:06.767 --> 12:10.367
Oh! Well,
what do you know?

12:10.367 --> 12:11.834
Well, look,

12:11.834 --> 12:13.867
I'm going to go ahead
and find Curvacia.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.567
See if my little
space honey landed.

12:19.867 --> 12:21.600
I'm going to
go follow Devon,

12:21.600 --> 12:23.400
make sure
nothing's going on

12:23.400 --> 12:24.667
with him and Phoebe.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.467
Okay, that should
be easy because
here he comes.

12:26.467 --> 12:29.467
Oh, Chels, if he sees me,
he's going to know I'm spying.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.300
All hail the princess!
All hail the princess!

12:31.300 --> 12:32.600
All hail

12:32.600 --> 12:33.567
the princess!

12:33.567 --> 12:34.767
All hail
Thank you.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.200
the princess!

12:36.200 --> 12:38.767
Mm-hmm?
Princess
Juliana?

12:38.767 --> 12:39.834
This is an honor.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.767
You never graced us
with your presence

12:41.767 --> 12:43.100
at any other convention.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.500
Yes, I know.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.100
I have been
a very busy princess,

12:46.100 --> 12:47.667
uh... doing
the business

12:47.667 --> 12:49.500
of, um...

12:49.500 --> 12:50.934
of princessing and such.

12:50.934 --> 12:53.400
And now,
my droid and I must leave you.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.500
Thank you. Okay.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.700
William?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.367
Where are you?

13:06.367 --> 13:08.233
Aren't there
any more suckers?

13:09.300 --> 13:11.400
I mean "customers."

13:14.300 --> 13:16.600
Lionel, where is everybody?

13:16.600 --> 13:19.500
They all chillin'.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.667
That's true.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.233
What?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.300
Lionel, did you just talk to me?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.100
You see anybody else

13:29.100 --> 13:32.000
in the room, homey?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Wait a second.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.100
You can't talk.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.233
Sure, I can.

13:38.233 --> 13:40.500
I just never had
anything to say.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.500
Now that you're cheating kids

13:46.500 --> 13:47.734
out of their money,

13:47.734 --> 13:49.600
and pretending
to be psychic,

13:49.600 --> 13:51.033
I'm speaking up.

13:52.500 --> 13:57.100
Okay, I promise I'll give all
those kids their money back.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.500
And promise not
to ever do it again?

14:01.400 --> 14:02.967
Okay, I promise.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.200
And, besides,
I don't need to cheat anymore.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.400
I'm going to be rich.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.467
I've got a talking rat!

14:09.467 --> 14:11.000
(<i>laughing </i>)

14:11.000 --> 14:12.500
Okay, he knows.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.300
Well, told you
we should have
just nailed him,

14:15.300 --> 14:18.300
but, no, you had to get
all high-tech about it.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.033
Okay, you got me,
and I got you,

14:25.033 --> 14:27.000
so now we're even.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.500
Not even close.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.200
You're grounded.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.800
For how long?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.200
Two weeks.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.100
Or until rats talk.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.834
Homey.

14:42.467 --> 14:45.000
<i>Now </i>you got nothing to say.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.734
I can't believe I'm finally
going to get to meet Curvacia.

14:52.734 --> 14:54.934
CURVACIA:
Enter, space traveler.

14:54.934 --> 14:56.567
I'm going in.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.233
Hi, honey.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.600
What can I sign for you?

15:02.600 --> 15:03.800
Oh, no, that's okay, ma'am.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.000
I'll just go ahead
and wait for Curvacia.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.500
Well, you're looking at her.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.467
Astro Blasto. Shhh!

15:15.033 --> 15:17.000
You're Curvacia?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.967
I'm guessing you're
not a fan of the show,

15:18.967 --> 15:19.934
because that picture

15:19.934 --> 15:21.500
was taken from
the first season,

15:21.500 --> 15:23.700
25 years ago.

15:23.700 --> 15:28.300
Oh! So that was you<i>then,</i>
and this is you<i>now?</i>

15:28.300 --> 15:31.100
You were expecting
your dream girl, right?

15:31.100 --> 15:33.300
Yeah. Right.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.600
I know, honey.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.800
I used to be
everybody's dream girl.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.000
But I am sure
a handsome boy like you

15:39.000 --> 15:40.934
has no problem
with the ladies.

15:40.934 --> 15:43.600
Well, you know,
me and the ladies...

15:45.600 --> 15:48.900
I probably could
do a little better.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.200
Well, you hang in there, honey,

15:51.200 --> 15:55.300
because you're going
to find that dream girl someday.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.400
Well, thank you.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.467
Will you still
sign this for me?

16:02.467 --> 16:04.100
"To Eddie, my newest fan."

16:04.100 --> 16:06.967
Welcome aboard, Eddie.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.500
Eddie?

16:09.500 --> 16:12.400
Astro, Blasto.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.834
Shhh!
Shhh!

16:14.834 --> 16:16.400
See ya.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.400
<i>Attention, Forcies.</i>

16:19.400 --> 16:23.000
(<i>cheering </i>)

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
It is Astro Date 2838.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.967
You all know
what that means.

16:29.967 --> 16:32.834
(<i>squawking yell </i>)

16:32.834 --> 16:34.767
(<i>squawking yells </i>)

16:34.767 --> 16:37.200
(<i>squawking yell </i>)

16:37.200 --> 16:40.867
It's time to give one another
the official Wissian welcome.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.100
Ooh! There's Devon.

16:46.567 --> 16:48.133
That nasty... get him.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.767
Everyone's doing it.

16:54.767 --> 16:57.300
I know. Apparently,
this is just
how Forcies

16:57.300 --> 16:58.834
say hello.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.100
You better back up

17:00.100 --> 17:01.400
off me, spaceboy.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.667
I feel so bad
for spying on him.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.600
There's nothing
even going on.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.600
Forcies, it is time
for the day's main event--

17:10.600 --> 17:15.300
a reenactment of the battle
scene from episode 424,

17:15.300 --> 17:18.200
"The Wrath of Krebo."

17:18.200 --> 17:22.300
(<i>cheering </i>)

17:22.300 --> 17:24.934
And, playing
our fearless hero,

17:24.934 --> 17:28.467
Captain James Quincy Stone,

17:28.467 --> 17:29.867
is Devon Turner!

17:29.867 --> 17:31.300
(<i>crowd cheering </i>)

17:31.300 --> 17:34.200
No, Chels. We've got
to get out of here.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.900
If Devon thinks
I don't trust him,

17:36.900 --> 17:38.934
we're going to be so over.

17:38.934 --> 17:40.934
And, presiding
over the day's battle

17:40.934 --> 17:43.500
is today's unexpected
guest, Princess Juliana!

17:43.500 --> 17:47.100
(<i>crowd cheering </i>)

17:51.033 --> 17:53.133
Uh... Hey, Devon.

17:53.133 --> 17:55.100
You know my name?

17:57.734 --> 17:59.200
Chelsea?

17:59.200 --> 18:00.367
Yeah?

18:00.367 --> 18:01.567
What are you doing here?

18:01.567 --> 18:04.834
Well... I'm not spying
on you or something,

18:04.834 --> 18:07.100
if that's what
you're getting at.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.500
Are you here with Rae?

18:10.100 --> 18:11.400
Oh...!

18:13.500 --> 18:17.000
Bring on the evil Krebo!

18:17.000 --> 18:22.300
(<i>crowd booing </i>)

18:24.100 --> 18:29.867
Now Stone and Krebo
will fight to the finish.

18:29.867 --> 18:31.133
(<i>audio feedback </i>)

18:31.133 --> 18:33.800
Testing, one, two.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.500
Testing.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.033
Fe, fi, fo, fum.

18:38.033 --> 18:42.500
I am the defender
of the universe!

18:43.600 --> 18:45.667
(electrical buzzing)

18:47.000 --> 18:49.400
And I will not fail.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.000
Hey, watch it!

18:53.467 --> 18:55.100
(<i>yelling </i>)

18:58.567 --> 18:59.700
What are you doing?

18:59.700 --> 19:00.967
You're not supposed to run.

19:00.967 --> 19:02.700
If you'd stop chasing me,
I wouldn't run.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.367
I wouldn't run.

19:04.367 --> 19:07.000
Now for the wrap--
my antigravity zap!

19:11.700 --> 19:15.400
Oh! Hey! I'm not supposed
to be flying today!

19:15.400 --> 19:17.834
Oh, I'm not liking this.

19:17.834 --> 19:19.400
Krebo's going to be sicko.
Oh! Oh!

19:19.400 --> 19:20.800
I'm kind of flipping
out of control!

19:20.800 --> 19:23.300
I am not liking it at all!

19:23.300 --> 19:26.834
Help! Help! Which way is up?

19:26.834 --> 19:28.400
Oh, okay, uh...

19:28.400 --> 19:30.700
How did you get on the ceiling?
How did that happen?

19:30.700 --> 19:32.900
Okay, okay,
I'm getting the hang of this.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.867
Hey, people gonna bring you...

19:34.867 --> 19:37.033
Stay still so I can unmask you!

19:37.033 --> 19:39.600
Oh, you ain't going
to do that, homeboy.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.667
This is not

19:40.667 --> 19:42.133
how the scene goes.

19:42.133 --> 19:43.600
This is all wrong.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.200
This battle is over!

19:45.200 --> 19:47.300
Raven, is that you?

19:47.300 --> 19:48.834
What are you doing?

19:48.834 --> 19:50.867
You said you didn't want
to come.

19:50.867 --> 19:53.100
I didn't, okay?
And then I did.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.300
Can someone get me down
from here?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.600
(<i>gasping </i>)

19:59.600 --> 20:01.300
Gently.

20:03.100 --> 20:07.000
Devon, I have
to be honest with you.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.967
I came here to spy on you.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.400
I knew that you and Phoebe
were going to nuzzle.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.200
I thought it was
a cheating nuzzle.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.133
It turned out to be
a greeting nuzzle.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.400
Wait a minute.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.300
I didn't even know
I was going
to nuzzle Phoebe,

20:20.300 --> 20:22.033
I mean,
so how did you know?

20:22.033 --> 20:24.000
Lucky guess?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.667
Rae, I thought we said
we were always going

20:25.667 --> 20:26.767
to be honest
with each other.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.367
Devon, wait, wait.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.734
Devon, wait.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.100
Okay, I'm here.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.900
Explain.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.200
I can't.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.200
Rae.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.233
Okay, you know
how we talked

20:41.233 --> 20:42.200
about honesty and trust?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.600
Yeah. I thought
we had that.

20:43.600 --> 20:49.200
We do. That's why you have
to trust me when I say....

20:49.200 --> 20:52.000
I honestly can't tell you.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.600
At least not right now.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.233
All right.

20:57.233 --> 20:58.834
I trust you, Rae.

20:58.834 --> 21:00.367
Thank you, Devon.

21:03.834 --> 21:06.000
The captain's
kissing Krebo!

21:06.000 --> 21:07.867
ALL:
Eww!

21:20.233 --> 21:21.734
I got you
a space smoothie.

21:21.734 --> 21:23.033
Oh, no.<i>You're</i>
a space smoothie.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.400
How did you know
what I wanted?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.300
Lucky guess.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.600
Oh, man!

21:27.600 --> 21:29.100
What's up, Eddie?
Did you see Chels?

21:29.100 --> 21:30.500
Oh, you mean the princess?

21:30.500 --> 21:32.233

21:32.233 --> 21:33.300

21:34.834 --> 21:36.033
a right on Mission.

21:36.033 --> 21:39.200

22:06.567 --> 22:11.767
