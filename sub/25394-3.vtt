00:01.566 --> 00:04.004
Previously onSalvation...What's your name?

00:04.047 --> 00:05.831
Joe Riggs.What do you do, Joe?

00:05.875 --> 00:07.268
I'm an electrician.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.052
I don't even work for Tanz.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.662
GRACE: What if this
wasn't an accident?

00:10.706 --> 00:13.926
Joe, this lady seems
to think you're dead.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.973
RE/SYST is assembling their own
asteroid mitigation project

00:17.017 --> 00:19.497
with 30 scientists
from around the world.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.846
DARIUS:
RE/SYST has Tess,

00:20.890 --> 00:22.500
now Liam and

00:22.544 --> 00:23.849
What aren't you telling us?If you want to know

00:23.893 --> 00:25.329
my secrets,
I need to know yours.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.071
I used to work for Darius.Tess?

00:28.115 --> 00:29.551
You created the software
for one of the most

00:29.594 --> 00:31.161
advanced learning computers
in the world?

00:31.205 --> 00:32.336
He fired you?

00:32.380 --> 00:35.078
I want things to be
normal between us.

00:35.122 --> 00:38.690
GRACE: This is the new normal, Darius.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.127
Detective Alonzo Carter.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.303
Investigating the disappearance
of Claire Rayburn.

00:42.346 --> 00:45.088
Doesn't he see police
have more pressing matters?

00:45.132 --> 00:46.176
Claire's my sister.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.004
GRACE:
I'm seeing her everywhere.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.267
The guilt of carrying this
secret is making me insane.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.008
And what exactly is your plan?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.401
A rail gun.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.142
What if I could get access
to the Maxwell Collider?

00:55.185 --> 00:56.360
We could convert..."We"?

00:56.404 --> 00:58.101
But I can't do it
without you.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.103
I am still the president.

01:00.147 --> 01:03.150
And I am going to take back
the White House.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.238
He's got an army
waiting in the wings.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.240
All we can do now is prepare.

01:06.283 --> 01:07.893
DARIUS:
Prepare for what?

01:07.937 --> 01:09.243
War.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.866
♪

01:29.263 --> 01:31.352
We're ready, Mr. President.

01:31.395 --> 01:33.397
Good.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.229
Just hope Mackenzie isn't.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.289
A little heads-up
would've been nice, Harris.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.073
I didn't expect him to
show up at your house.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.031
Well, he did, asking
all sorts of questions:

01:59.075 --> 02:00.816
when was the last time
I saw Claire Rayburn,

02:00.859 --> 02:02.209
what was my relationship
with her,

02:02.252 --> 02:03.906
what was yourrelationship
with her.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.169
Look, I'm sorry you had
to go through that,

02:06.213 --> 02:07.170
but don't worry,
Detective...

02:07.214 --> 02:08.780
Carter.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.521
Yes, Detective Carter
will move off this.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.306
With everything
that's happening,

02:12.349 --> 02:14.960
it can't be the D.C. Police
Department's priority.

02:15.004 --> 02:18.007
It's not the department's
priority, it's his.

02:20.052 --> 02:22.316
:
She's his sister, Harris.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.015
Somehow, he failed
to mention that salient fact.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.277
He's coming by
to collect her things.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.149
Today.
Today?

02:29.192 --> 02:31.194
With all the hell
that's breaking loose?

02:32.978 --> 02:35.590
Okay, just hand them over
and move on.

02:35.633 --> 02:38.201
And remember,

02:38.245 --> 02:39.420
there's no body.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.552
And if there's no body,
there's no crime.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.210
Well, it's been a rough couple
of weeks, wouldn't you say?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.169
CROWD :
Take her down! Take her down!

02:49.212 --> 02:51.954
Damn it, Harris,
how did this happen?

02:51.997 --> 02:53.738
I thought we had eyes on
all corners of the city.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.653
We do. After he raided
those Army bases,

02:55.697 --> 02:58.874
we expected him to roll in
with tanks and armored Humvees.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.398
Instead, he showed up at the
Supreme Court in an UberX,

03:01.442 --> 03:03.226
with two guards
and a team of lawyers.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.750
Yeah, which nobody in this room
could have predicted.

03:07.317 --> 03:08.753
BENNETT:
Thank you.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.321
Thank you so much, thank you.
Thank you.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.239
BENNETT: We must not shrink
from honestly and boldly

03:16.283 --> 03:18.633
confronting the conditions

03:18.676 --> 03:21.288
that are in our country
and in the world today.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.290
Now, not since Lincoln and Davis

03:23.333 --> 03:27.381
has this land been divided
by two presidents.

03:27.424 --> 03:31.341
And never, never in the history
of our great nation

03:31.385 --> 03:34.736
have two presidents both laid
claim to the same office.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.999
My team has filed
an emergency writ

03:37.042 --> 03:39.480
with the United States
Supreme Court.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.917
And as the testimony
will soon prove,

03:41.960 --> 03:46.269
my removal from office
was not only unconstitutional,

03:46.313 --> 03:48.271
but it was criminal.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.187
Now, here,
in these hallowed halls,

03:51.231 --> 03:54.973
this matter can now finally be
put to rest once and for all,

03:55.017 --> 03:58.368
both legally and peacefully.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.196
Unbelievable, he just
claimed the moral high ground.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.850
BENNETT:
Now, I am the only one,

04:01.893 --> 04:05.593
the only one, that can save us
from this impending Armageddon,

04:05.636 --> 04:08.465
and rest assured
that I do have a plan

04:08.509 --> 04:10.293
that will stop the asteroid.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.339
Thank you, thank you.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.123
And as for the criminals

04:14.166 --> 04:16.212
currently residing
in the White House,

04:16.256 --> 04:17.605
Pauline Mackenzie,

04:17.648 --> 04:21.391
Darius Tanz...

04:21.435 --> 04:23.567
and Defense Secretary
Harris Edwards...

04:23.611 --> 04:26.440
When the world
finally learns the truth,

04:26.483 --> 04:29.399
you will pay dearly
for what you have do...

04:29.443 --> 04:33.055
He blew the dog whistle and
the whole pound turned up.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.361
Now's our chance,
Madam President.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.058
Send out the troops, arrest him.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.364
DARIUS: No. That's exactly
what he wants,

04:37.407 --> 04:39.017
to be arrested
on live television.

04:39.061 --> 04:41.281
We come on tanks a-blazing
Soviet Bloc style,

04:41.324 --> 04:42.673
and we're only feeding
his narrative.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.502
There won't be a narrative
once he's behind bars.

04:45.546 --> 04:46.851
Madam President,
we have no choice

04:46.895 --> 04:48.462
but to submit
to the rule of law.

04:48.505 --> 04:49.550
We need to win through
proper legal channels

04:49.593 --> 04:51.465
in order to maintain
our legitimacy.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.336
Otherwise,

04:53.380 --> 04:56.470
yeah, we-we risk losing
the hearts and minds.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.906
Hearts and minds

04:57.949 --> 04:59.516
This isn't some
philosophical debate.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.345
The very fate of our democracy
is at stake here,

05:02.389 --> 05:03.651
Madam President...Gentlemen.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.263
Grace.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.353
You're my senior advisor.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.399
Advise.

05:14.052 --> 05:16.359
I think
the vice president is right.

05:16.403 --> 05:19.449
The rule of law shouldn't be
the first thing out the window,

05:19.493 --> 05:20.624
it should be the last.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.413
Get me the White House Counsel.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.378
They're gone.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.945
DARIUS:
When did this happen?

05:36.988 --> 05:38.729
As soon as Bennett's speech
hit the airwaves.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.080
Darius, I can't
supervise a project

05:42.124 --> 05:44.082
if there's no one here
to supervise.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.519
So the Army Corps of Engineers
pulled out?

05:45.562 --> 05:46.781
Just like that.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.348
Every last one of them.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.349
And the laborers went with them.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.959
On whose orders?

05:51.002 --> 05:52.526
The C.O. of Fort Gregson.

05:52.569 --> 05:55.137
He's received conflicting orders
from Mackenzie and Bennett,

05:55.180 --> 05:56.921
and now his team
is standing down

05:56.965 --> 05:59.359
until they know who
the legitimate president is.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.708
Insane.Darius.

06:00.751 --> 06:02.797
I have six miles
of tunnel to overhaul,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.755
and just a few weeks
to get it done,

06:04.799 --> 06:07.018
if you want
that rail gun operational

06:07.062 --> 06:09.281
in time to divert the asteroid.

06:09.325 --> 06:12.415
You'd better pray that Supreme
Court decision goes your way.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.938
It will, it has to.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.507
Damn it.
JILLIAN:
Sorry.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.335
You have a meeting
with the White House Counsel

06:19.379 --> 06:20.641
in the Cabinet Room.Meetings.

06:20.684 --> 06:23.905
Meetings, insufferable meetings.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.039
Jillian...

06:28.083 --> 06:30.999
the man who died in the Ark,
Joe Riggs--

06:31.042 --> 06:32.827
you said he wasn't who
he claimed to be.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.219
Yes.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.308
So who is he?

06:36.352 --> 06:38.659
Find out.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.317
WOMAN:
So, by crashing

06:45.361 --> 06:47.102
these canisters
into the asteroid,

06:47.145 --> 06:48.582
we can paint a broad section

06:48.625 --> 06:50.453
of the surface white,
which would change

06:50.497 --> 06:53.761
its thermal properties and
therefore alter its trajectory.

06:53.804 --> 06:54.936
Cosmic paintballs?

06:54.979 --> 06:56.459
The asteroid
has such low gravity

06:56.503 --> 06:58.592
that most if not all
of your graffiti paint's

06:58.635 --> 06:59.636
gonna get lost in space.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.464
RE/SYST AVATAR:
Mr. Cole,

07:01.508 --> 07:03.553
it's your team's turn to wow us.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.599
Happy to oblige.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.122
It is simple.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.819
We're gonna construct
a solar sail.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.474
And with the pressure
of sunlight

07:11.518 --> 07:12.867
and the reflections
of the photons,

07:12.910 --> 07:15.130
it will blow the asteroid
off its course, like a...

07:15.173 --> 07:17.480
a sailboat
catching an ocean breeze.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.699
WOMAN:
Simple?

07:18.742 --> 07:20.440
And how are you planning
to dock this sail

07:20.483 --> 07:21.484
on a rotating asteroid?

07:21.528 --> 07:22.790
We're not.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.705
We're gonna dock it
on the gravity tractor,

07:24.748 --> 07:26.315
which is propelled
by the EmDrive,

07:26.358 --> 07:27.534
which is already up there.

07:27.577 --> 07:30.667
Which I engineered,
by the way.

07:30.711 --> 07:34.454
So, we're gonna reprogram
the GT's EmDrive

07:34.497 --> 07:37.500
and turn it from an engine
into a magnet.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.502
But then the asteroid's
iron core

07:39.546 --> 07:42.462
will pull the entire
gravity tractor right into it.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.941
Exactly!
Which is why we need the sail.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.900
Right? 'Cause it will
counterbalance the forces,

07:45.943 --> 07:47.728
thus pulling the asteroid
off its course.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.516
ALYCIA:
Okay, imagine a cruise ship.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.605
It needs a tugboat
to pull it into port.

07:55.649 --> 07:58.695
If the tugboat has no engine,
it crashes into the cruise ship.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.742
LIAM:
But give that tugboat a sail--
a solar sail, in our case--

08:01.785 --> 08:04.179
and voilà.MAN: "Voilà"?

08:04.222 --> 08:07.138
You'll need a sail
thousands of miles wide

08:07.182 --> 08:09.401
to generate the force necessary.

08:09.445 --> 08:10.620
How are you addressing
that problem?

08:10.664 --> 08:12.187
CROFT:
It's a hurdle,

08:12.230 --> 08:14.494
frankly, which I've raised,
by the way, more than once.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.975
The time for theoretical debate
is over.

08:18.019 --> 08:20.543
Samson will be here in 120 days.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.197
The clock is ticking.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.155
Each team has 24 hours

08:24.199 --> 08:27.419
to put forward a workable model
of your respective plans.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.813
The winner with the most
viable plan will take command

08:29.857 --> 08:32.599
of the entire task force.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.564
Roland Cavanaugh,
White House Counsel.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.219
Mr. Vice President, Ms. Barrows,
we haven't had the pleasure
until now.

08:44.262 --> 08:47.004
On what basis does Bennett make
his legal claim?

08:47.048 --> 08:49.311
Unlawful seizure
of the Oval Office.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.617
He's claiming

08:50.660 --> 08:53.489
that the four of you
orchestrated a coup.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.578
That Harris Edwards
kidnapped him at gunpoint.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.579
That you, Madam President,

08:56.623 --> 08:58.189
faked your own death.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.582
And that Claire Rayburn
was murdered

08:59.626 --> 09:01.062
and you're covering it up.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.107
HARRIS: Yes, we removed
and detained Monroe Bennett

09:03.151 --> 09:06.284
because he was a criminal
who illegally seized power

09:06.328 --> 09:08.373
by poisoning
a sitting president.

09:08.417 --> 09:09.549
And Claire Rayburn...?

09:10.637 --> 09:11.899
HARRIS:
She's a fugitive,

09:11.942 --> 09:13.770
as far as we're concerned.

09:13.814 --> 09:17.600
Well, Bennett's team
has issued an emergency writ

09:17.644 --> 09:19.602
with the Supreme Court,
which they have granted

09:19.646 --> 09:22.605
in pursuit
of Supreme Court Rule 11.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.781
GRACE: "Is of such
imperative public importance

09:24.825 --> 09:27.349
"as to justify deviation
from normal appellate practice

09:27.392 --> 09:29.699
and to require
immediate determination."

09:29.743 --> 09:32.789
Perfect. A man with no
regard for the rule of law

09:32.833 --> 09:36.227
is using the law to steal the
country out from under us.

09:36.271 --> 09:38.142
You have to applaud
his audacity.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.970
MACKENZIE: Forgive me
if I don't applaud the man

09:40.014 --> 09:41.102
who conspired to murder me.

09:41.145 --> 09:42.407
An accusation

09:42.451 --> 09:44.714
which has no actual evidence,
unfortunately.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.629
Because Bennett destroyed it.

09:46.673 --> 09:47.935
So it's a case
of he said, she said.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.632
Let's cut to the
chase, Mr. Cavanaugh.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.155
Are you saying
we're going to lose

09:51.199 --> 09:52.635
'Cause I have a team
of Army Corps engineers

09:52.679 --> 09:54.028
that just walked off the job

09:54.071 --> 09:55.725
and no one to build
the only thing

09:55.769 --> 09:57.379
that's gonna save
this sorry planet.

09:57.422 --> 10:00.643
If we lose the government,
we lose the rail gun project.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.124
We all go kaboom.

10:03.167 --> 10:06.780
ROLAND: I can't lie.
The facts aren't good.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.173
The law is tricky.
The Twenty-fifth Amendment

10:09.217 --> 10:11.349
provides for the vice president
to be sworn in

10:11.393 --> 10:15.136
upon the death or incapacitation
of the president, and he was.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.442
Our best defense will be

10:17.486 --> 10:19.183
that Bennett gained
the Oval Office

10:19.227 --> 10:21.185
through unclean hands.

10:21.229 --> 10:23.405
Well, they were as dirty
as it gets.

10:23.448 --> 10:24.536
We have nothing to hide.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.669
All we need to do
is tell the truth.

10:26.713 --> 10:27.801
Well, that's good,
because Bennett's team

10:27.844 --> 10:28.976
just subpoenaed all of you.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.020
What?

10:30.064 --> 10:31.282
GRACE:
We're testifying

10:31.326 --> 10:33.807
under oath
before the Supreme Court?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.678
Can they even do that?They're the Supreme Court.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.941
They can do
whatever the hell they want.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.944
Be prepared
to talk about everything,

10:40.988 --> 10:44.687
including the missing piece,
Claire Rayburn.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.647
My friends, we're going to war,
just not the way we thought.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.736
If we lose, we
lose everything.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.917
♪

11:09.973 --> 11:12.193
CLAIRE:
Lying to the Supreme Court.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.978
Tsk, tsk.
Such a bad girl.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.763
But once you've
murdered someone,

11:16.806 --> 11:18.068
I guess all bets are off.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.330
Get out.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.549
ELLA:
I'm sorry, Ms. Barrows.

11:20.592 --> 11:21.550
I can come back.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.160
Oh, no. Uh, so sorry, Ella.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.858
What was it you wanted?

11:24.901 --> 11:28.296
There's a Detective Alonzo
Carter, White House Security.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.298
Says you have
an appointment.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.822
Send him up.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.621
Vice president's
office in the attic?

11:49.665 --> 11:51.188
That's a first.

11:51.232 --> 11:54.801
Status quo and I
never really got along.

11:54.844 --> 12:01.198
You wanted to see me?

12:01.242 --> 12:03.418
What kind of numbers are we
talking about with Bennett?

12:03.461 --> 12:04.680
Forces, weapons?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.812
Between the Army and Marines,

12:05.855 --> 12:07.509
a dozen generals
that we know of,

12:07.552 --> 12:09.598
and he stripped three
regional bases clean:

12:09.641 --> 12:11.426
ordinance, DPVs,
fuel supplies.

12:11.469 --> 12:14.211
They're clearly preparing
for anything.

12:14.255 --> 12:17.737
You mean if the court decision
goes against them?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.477
Well, I'm not one
to fathom the mind

12:19.521 --> 12:22.480
of a recalcitrant narcissist.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.918
I'll leave that
insight to you.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.963
Finally, a compliment.

12:27.007 --> 12:30.271
Look, Darius, we have
to work together.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.099
I accept that.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.883
Do you?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.015
Yes.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.756
Good.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.845
'Cause I need access
to micro-battery technology

12:38.888 --> 12:41.108
that DARPA's been developing.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.762
A stealth jet, DARPA tech.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.720
You know, whatever happened
to simple requests

12:44.764 --> 12:46.548
like paper clips
and more toner?

12:46.591 --> 12:48.811
Mr. Secretary,
I need to figure out

12:48.855 --> 12:50.726
how to get those nukes back
from RE/SYST

12:50.770 --> 12:53.337
and stop Samson with a rail gun
that doesn't yet exist.

12:53.381 --> 12:56.427
So, if I seem
less than engaged

12:56.471 --> 12:58.212
with your little Game
of Thrones,well,

12:58.255 --> 13:00.997
it's because I have to be.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.607
Now, can I get that
technology or not?

13:02.651 --> 13:04.000
For what purpose?

13:04.044 --> 13:06.089
I have a plan to evict
RE/SYST from Tanz.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.222
If we lose the government,

13:08.265 --> 13:12.661
I'm gonna need to get Tanz back
and Liam to build that rail gun.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.402
Okay.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.883
You'll have it.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.018
Is Grace all right?

13:24.891 --> 13:27.284
That's a vague question.

13:27.328 --> 13:30.113
I get the feeling that
the two of you are...

13:31.462 --> 13:33.856
...withholding information.

13:33.900 --> 13:37.860
Nothing that concerns you,
Mr. Vice President.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.566
Looks like she left in a hurry.

13:48.610 --> 13:52.875
Was a crazy day for everyone.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.050
Right.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.055
Ah.

13:59.099 --> 14:02.885
Claire wasn't
everyone's cup of tea,

14:02.929 --> 14:05.888
but you don't get to be
senior advisor to the president

14:05.932 --> 14:08.456
unless you hurt a few
people along the way.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.892
Isn't that right,
Ms. Barrows?

14:09.936 --> 14:12.025
That's a cynical view
of the world.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.810
Maybe. Maybe.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.335
Well, this used to
be her night-light.

14:18.379 --> 14:21.991
Would you believe Claire was
afraid of the dark

14:22.035 --> 14:23.863
Look, Detective, I, uh...

14:23.906 --> 14:25.865
Alonzo.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.214
Alonzo.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.693
I wish I could be of more help.

14:28.737 --> 14:29.999
Well, that's good to know...

14:31.479 --> 14:34.047
...'cause you may be
hearing from me again.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.727
What the hell?

15:06.775 --> 15:08.995
It's unbalanced.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.692
The solar wind is too weak

15:10.735 --> 15:13.042
and the EmDrive
is too strong.Such negativity.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.348
All we need to do is improve

15:14.391 --> 15:16.132
the efficiency of the sail.
That's it.

15:16.176 --> 15:19.179
No, all we need to do
is go back to the drawing board.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.921
But we haven't even
explored multiple sails

15:21.964 --> 15:23.966
or carbon nanotubes.Yeah,

15:24.010 --> 15:26.012
or maybe an angel
will flutter down

15:26.055 --> 15:27.970
and spirit the asteroid away
on little rainbow wings.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.189
How about that, huh?

15:29.232 --> 15:31.104
Okay, we're losing time
we don't have.

15:31.147 --> 15:34.194
Show of hands-- who wants to
pursue Liam's solar sail plan?

15:37.023 --> 15:39.460
And who wants to scrap the idea
and start over?

15:40.896 --> 15:42.506
CROFT: Score's three
to three, Alycia.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.030
You're the deciding vote.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.080
I'm with Liam.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.039
Let Tess run
the numbers.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.999
Where are you going?

15:57.043 --> 15:58.653
Well, since you two lovebirds
already seem

15:58.696 --> 16:00.176
to have saved the world,
I'm gonna go

16:00.220 --> 16:02.048
grab an espresso.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.096
Hey, Croft, stop.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.272
Why are you being
such a prick in there?

16:09.316 --> 16:12.275
Because I can't stand to see
your little schoolboy crush

16:12.319 --> 16:13.929
jeopardize
the entire human race.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.539
Oh, what the hell
are you talking about?

16:18.325 --> 16:22.024
I don't trust her.
She's a snake.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.940
And if you think
Jillian was a distraction,

16:24.984 --> 16:28.552
wait until she slithers
her way into your heart.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.906
JILLIAN:
Nate, thanks for helping me

16:34.950 --> 16:37.257
cut through the red tape
to track down Joe.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.172
Or whatever his name really is.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.564
I owe you one.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.044
Working at the Pentagon
has its perks.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.916
And it was the closest
I could get to a date with you,

16:44.960 --> 16:47.267
seeing as you have
a boyfriend.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.095
I do.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.402
Hey, you okay?

16:52.446 --> 16:57.059
Just having a sense memory of
my grandmother's open coffin.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.018
Dr. Mauer?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.802
Who's asking?Jillian Hayes.

17:00.845 --> 17:03.631
From the White House.Yes, of course.

17:03.674 --> 17:06.199
Sorry. As you
can imagine,

17:06.242 --> 17:09.854
it's been rather insane
the last few weeks.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.074
What happened
to all these people?

17:12.118 --> 17:13.597
Lost hope.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.991
Suicides, overdoses,

17:16.035 --> 17:18.211
people getting shot
trying to hoard supplies.

17:18.254 --> 17:22.302
You're here about
case number...?

17:22.345 --> 17:24.173
B-6138.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.393
Well, that one's
just been claimed.

17:26.436 --> 17:27.916
Claimed

17:27.959 --> 17:29.222
Said he was
his brother.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.224
He had all the proper paperwork.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.269
Um...

17:33.313 --> 17:35.184
Can we get a copy
of the autopsy report?

17:35.228 --> 17:36.446
For the vice president.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.187
Certainly.

17:42.365 --> 17:45.238
Got to admit,
this one was peculiar.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.196
Um, peculiar how?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.329
Well, there
was a chip

17:49.372 --> 17:51.113
behind his ear.
Some kind of implant.

17:51.157 --> 17:54.116
Uh, the kind they put in
pets to track or I.D. them.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.509
But not humans.
At least, not usually.

17:55.552 --> 17:56.945
Do you still have it?

17:56.988 --> 17:58.903
No. Everything goes
with next of kin.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.731
But there's a photo of it
in the file.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.140
This is it?

18:18.184 --> 18:20.011
Everything that was
in Claire's office?

18:20.055 --> 18:21.317
Mm.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.276
It's what I was given.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.370
I got you
what you wanted.

18:30.413 --> 18:33.373
It's time to give me
what I want, Mr. President.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.939
Tell me everything you know

18:34.983 --> 18:36.637
about what happened
to my sister.

18:46.255 --> 18:49.040
Now, you said that after
President Mackenzie came out

18:49.084 --> 18:51.086
of hiding and received
the backing of the Joint Chiefs,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.871
she departed the Pentagon
garage at what time?

18:53.915 --> 18:55.656
Uh, 2:30 p.m.

18:55.699 --> 18:59.094
And you and Secretary Edwards
followed after her?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.575
Yes. Straight to
the White House.

19:01.618 --> 19:05.405
Now, according to
the White House logs,

19:05.448 --> 19:07.276
you and Secretary Edwards
arrived there

19:07.320 --> 19:09.322
over an hour later.

19:09.365 --> 19:10.627
HARRIS:
Yes, that's right.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.673
Ms. Barrows and I
stayed back to strategize

19:12.716 --> 19:15.589
how best to inform
Congress of the coup.

19:15.632 --> 19:18.157
Is that your memory,
Ms. Barrows?

19:18.200 --> 19:20.202
Yes.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.595
Okay.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.684
Now, let's, uh, talk
about the missing

19:23.727 --> 19:25.207
key witness, Claire Rayburn.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.991
When was the last time
anyone saw her?

19:27.035 --> 19:29.429
Several hours prior.

19:29.472 --> 19:32.083
It seems Ms. Rayburn is the key
to this whole puzzle.

19:32.127 --> 19:34.477
Any idea as to her whereabouts?

19:36.262 --> 19:38.394
She's in the wind.

19:46.837 --> 19:50.450
JILLIAN: Darius, you're
not gonna believe this.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.495
What are you doing?

19:52.539 --> 19:53.757
Building a drone decoy.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.106
To save the world.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.412
You know, the usual.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.590
I got the autopsy
report on Joe Riggs.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.201
Well, who isn't
Joe Riggs.

20:02.244 --> 20:05.334
He had a implant in
the side of his neck.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.253
What do you think it means?

20:11.297 --> 20:13.603
I don't know. Yet.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.562
Jillian, blow
this photo up.

20:15.605 --> 20:16.606
See who makes this chip.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.042
How many were sold.
And to whom.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.522
Okay.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.350
Good work.

20:26.094 --> 20:28.618
Darius, any word from Liam?

20:28.662 --> 20:30.185
No.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.188
But I'm hoping to make contact.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.234
Soon.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.847
It's so hard when
you love someone

20:39.890 --> 20:43.024
and you know they're out there
but you can't be with them.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.811
I can only imagine.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.032
:
Yeah.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.601
GRACE: No, Your Honor,
I have no knowledge

20:54.644 --> 20:56.690
of Claire Rayburn's whereabouts.

20:58.648 --> 21:03.740
I have no knowledge
of Claire Rayburn's whereabouts.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.046
That's a lie.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.830
I killed her and covered it up.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.835
You're gonna crack
like an egg.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.844
Ms. Barrows.

21:20.888 --> 21:23.369
We need to have a little talk.

21:33.117 --> 21:35.642
Detective, I gave you
everything I had.

21:35.685 --> 21:38.906
Did you?

21:38.949 --> 21:41.865
Okay.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.519
'Cause a few choice facts

21:43.563 --> 21:47.218
were omitted from our
friendly conversation.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.569
Like?

21:49.612 --> 21:53.355
Like... my sister had
an intimate relationship

21:53.399 --> 21:54.748
with Harris Edwards.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.142
So did you.

21:58.186 --> 22:01.668
I'm sorry, why is my business
your business?

22:01.711 --> 22:04.801
Because Harris Edwards
is a person of interest.

22:04.845 --> 22:09.197
Well, I would trust
Secretary Edwards with my life.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.677
:
I bet you would.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.069
He's an honest man.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.594
He certainly looks the part.

22:14.637 --> 22:17.901
Firm handshake,
steady gaze,

22:17.945 --> 22:19.599
like all the best liars.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.992
If you've already made up
your mind about him,

22:22.036 --> 22:23.994
what do you expect
to learn from me?

22:24.038 --> 22:27.041
Well, I have a witness
who believes Claire

22:27.084 --> 22:29.260
was murdered

22:29.304 --> 22:33.047
by Harris Edwards
in order to silence her.

22:33.090 --> 22:36.093
Who would believe that?
Other than Monroe Bennett.

22:36.137 --> 22:37.791
Secretary Edwards
abducted Bennett.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.270
Legally detained, not abducted.

22:39.314 --> 22:42.404
Let's leave the semantics
up to the Supreme Court.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.407
The day she disappeared,

22:45.451 --> 22:47.496
Monroe Bennett was abducted
at gunpoint by Secretary Edwards

22:47.540 --> 22:48.932
and an unidentified man

22:48.976 --> 22:51.544
who may have been
a CIA operative.

22:51.587 --> 22:54.024
Any thoughts on who
this Mr. X might be?

22:58.986 --> 23:02.859
FYI, I have skills
other than body disposal.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.948
I love you.

23:08.430 --> 23:12.695
Detective, you want to know
the truth about Claire?

23:12.739 --> 23:15.959
You don't want Harris Edwards.
You want me.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.151
You better be
in bed, Liam,

23:34.195 --> 23:36.676
like a good little prodigy.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.250
Come on, kid.

23:46.294 --> 23:48.644
A dragonfly at night, that's got
to raise your antennae.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.286
Holy crap.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.332
Darius?

24:34.560 --> 24:37.171
Liam, I know you're under
a news blackout in there,

24:37.214 --> 24:39.521
but things have gone
from bad to worse out here,

24:39.565 --> 24:42.655
and you're the only one
who can do anything about it.

24:42.698 --> 24:46.876
To stop RE/SYST and take control
of those orbiting nukes,

24:46.920 --> 24:50.271
we have only one option,
destroy Tess.

24:50.314 --> 24:53.883
She's the one controlling
those nukes.

24:53.927 --> 24:56.669
This chip contains a virus
that'll do just that.

24:56.712 --> 24:59.149
All you have to do is upload it
to the server

24:59.193 --> 25:01.412
in Tess's control room.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.763
And the virus will take care
of the rest.Uh, yeah.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.635
I know what to do

25:06.679 --> 25:08.594
to solve the solar sails.

25:08.637 --> 25:09.856
Okay, so these new calcs

25:09.899 --> 25:12.554
seem spot-on,
but the simulations still fail.

25:12.598 --> 25:13.860
Why?

25:13.903 --> 25:15.252
Because the
sail's too small.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.516
Size does matter,

25:17.559 --> 25:18.604
but not as much as we think.

25:18.647 --> 25:19.735
What do you mean?

25:19.779 --> 25:21.432
Well, if solar radiation
is so weak

25:21.476 --> 25:23.478
it requires a sail
the size of the moon,

25:23.522 --> 25:25.698
maybe we need a different source
of radiation.

25:25.741 --> 25:28.570
One that we can manufacture
and control.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.964
Like a space laser.
Yes.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.618
It's expensive
but it's doable.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.315
It would give us all
the energy we need.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.535
Exactly. Solar sails,

25:36.578 --> 25:38.232
space laser--
by themselves,

25:38.275 --> 25:39.581
nothing much;
put them together,

25:39.625 --> 25:41.496
and you've got magic.Holy crap.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.498
You're a genius.
That is amazing.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.985
Sorry.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.682
I'm not.

25:57.686 --> 25:58.948
ALONZO:
Look, I don't believe you.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.689
Your sister knew she was
about to be indicted.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.648
Is it so hard to believe she
might want to disappear?

26:02.691 --> 26:04.432
For poisoning the president
of the United States.

26:04.475 --> 26:05.955
And for putting
a hit out on me,

26:05.999 --> 26:08.436
and several others
who didn't serve her ends.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.657
You see this?

26:11.700 --> 26:14.964
A homeless guy who thought
his rusty box cutter

26:15.008 --> 26:17.358
was Excalibur dug it into me.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.969
No big deal,
but my sister went ballistic.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.623
Next thing I know,
Pauline Mackenzie's

26:21.667 --> 26:23.625
personal physician
is at my door.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.801
My sister recruited the
president of the United States

26:25.845 --> 26:27.020
to help her baby brother,

26:27.063 --> 26:29.239
a nobody cop.

26:29.283 --> 26:31.764
That's who Claire Rayburn is.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.243
She might be
a good sister,

26:33.287 --> 26:36.638
but she's also a traitor
and a murderer.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.640
I know a killer
when I see one, Ms. Barrows.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.687
And when I find out
who killed my sister,

26:41.730 --> 26:43.863
God help them.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.170
Thanks for the coffee.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.533
Alycia, th-this
isn't real. I...

27:04.710 --> 27:05.928
We're just locked down
here together.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.582
I've got a girlfriend.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.758
So do I.

27:09.802 --> 27:12.369
And a boyfriend.

27:12.413 --> 27:16.156
But they're not here
and we are.

27:16.199 --> 27:19.594
Okay, um...

27:19.638 --> 27:22.031
I'm kind of engaged.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.772
No worries.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.513
We're good.

27:26.949 --> 27:30.083
I call dibs on rewriting
the code for the beta test.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.824
You round us up some caffeine.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.652
It's gonna be tight
to get this ready by morning.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.787
Hey, Liam.

27:38.831 --> 27:40.528
We did it.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.878
If we can get
this approved,

27:42.922 --> 27:44.750
we can stop
that damn space rock.

27:55.978 --> 27:58.894
Liam, what are you waiting for?

28:00.461 --> 28:02.202
Is it a bad time?

28:02.245 --> 28:05.248
DARIUS:
So this chip was in Joe's neck?JILLIAN: Yeah.

28:05.292 --> 28:08.425
The NSA wasn't able
to determine the manufacturer.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.471
It was sold on the black market,
unable to trace.

28:10.514 --> 28:13.213
DARIUS:
It's definitely a tracker,
an advanced one at that.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.997
Someone didn't want
that Ark to take off

28:15.041 --> 28:18.392
so badly that they planted Joe
on the inside, and...

28:18.435 --> 28:20.960
and almost killed
everyone in the process.

28:21.003 --> 28:23.963
JILLIAN:
So you're saying that Joe,

28:24.006 --> 28:26.922
who isn't Joe,
was the saboteur.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.058
GRACE:
Claire's brother was here.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.930
Harris, I feel like
I'm losing it.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.802
He's putting together
the pieces quickly

28:36.845 --> 28:39.761
about me, you, my father.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.807
I can't stop thinking
about what I did.

28:43.591 --> 28:47.682
I can't... I can't lie
under oath. I can't.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.250
That's exactly
what you have to do.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.687
The truth will set Bennett free

28:52.731 --> 28:54.689
and put the rest of us
in prison.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.865
Darius and Mackenzie
could lose the government.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.870
Grace, sometimes you have to do
the wrong thing

29:01.914 --> 29:03.350
for the right reasons.

29:03.393 --> 29:07.397
But who decides what's wrong
or what's right?

29:07.441 --> 29:08.834
Who made us God?

29:08.877 --> 29:10.966
I need you
to pull yourself together.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.534
We have to testify tomorrow.

29:13.577 --> 29:14.796
Get some sleep.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.232
You're whispering.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.495
Harris, is someone there?

29:22.499 --> 29:24.284
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.942
That was Grace?

29:29.985 --> 29:32.161
Yeah.

29:32.205 --> 29:33.859
You two had a thing.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.643
Yeah.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.175
Now it's over?

30:06.239 --> 30:07.936
Jillian

30:09.895 --> 30:12.723
And me.

30:13.942 --> 30:17.250
Darius, what's going on?

30:17.293 --> 30:19.078
Grace, can we talk?

30:21.732 --> 30:23.082
I'll be upstairs.

30:25.693 --> 30:27.651
GRACE: So you're saying
Joe was part of some

30:27.695 --> 30:29.305
conspiracy in the Ark?

30:29.349 --> 30:30.872
Yes, it was sabotage.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.440
My construction for
the Ark was sound.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.007
And that's why
you're here,

30:35.050 --> 30:36.835
at 1:00 a.m.,
the night before we testify

30:36.878 --> 30:38.227
in front of the Supreme Court.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.664
You want absolution?

30:40.708 --> 30:43.276
Okay.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.104
Great.
I almost killed
you, Grace.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.109
Do you know how haunted
I've been by the possibility

30:50.152 --> 30:52.111
that I almost killed you?

30:56.985 --> 31:00.728
Darius,
I know what it's like

31:00.771 --> 31:03.078
to be haunted...

31:05.037 --> 31:06.734
You did what
you had to do...

31:06.777 --> 31:10.346
keeping us down there
in the Ark.

31:11.957 --> 31:15.656
Please don't torture
yourself anymore.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.919
Grace...

31:19.834 --> 31:21.792
I'm not the only one
who's tortured, am I?

31:21.836 --> 31:24.578
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

31:26.841 --> 31:28.190
No.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.159
Darius.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.859
I forgive you.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.360
It is the only way
to disarm those nukes.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.493
And then we can all get
the hell out of here,

35:47.536 --> 35:50.365
and restore the world to
some kind of order.
Order?

35:50.409 --> 35:52.541
An asteroid is coming, Liam.

35:52.585 --> 35:55.196
The world's going to be in chaos
until we stop it.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.851
And we're on the verge
of being able to do that.

35:57.894 --> 36:01.071
We won the bake-off.
We did?

36:01.115 --> 36:05.032
Yes. RE/SYST had Tess analyze
all the results.

36:05.075 --> 36:07.643
Our beta test showed
a 93% chance of success.

36:07.687 --> 36:09.167
The other teams
weren't even close.

36:11.734 --> 36:15.303
Darius put you
up to this, didn't he?

36:15.347 --> 36:17.262
You're gonna do the bidding
of Darius Tanz

36:17.305 --> 36:19.046
instead of saving the world?

36:19.089 --> 36:21.266
Liam, you're loyal to a man

36:21.309 --> 36:23.703
who isn't loyal to anyone
but himself.

36:23.746 --> 36:25.966
No. No. He's changed
since you knew him.

36:26.009 --> 36:27.794
He's changed even
since I've known him.

36:27.837 --> 36:31.232
Whether or not you agree
with their methods,

36:31.276 --> 36:34.757
RE/SYST just gave us the
resources to stop that asteroid.

36:34.801 --> 36:37.282
We've got the greatest
scientists in the world here,

36:37.325 --> 36:39.632
all ready to do our bidding.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.503
You disarm those nukes,

36:41.547 --> 36:43.679
you dismantle
the best weapon we have--

36:43.723 --> 36:47.074
forced international
cooperation.

36:49.642 --> 36:52.471
It's time to be
your own man, Liam Cole.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.131
President Mackenzie
was being dosed

37:01.175 --> 37:03.090
with lethal levels of mercury.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.745
So you're testifying--
under oath--

37:05.788 --> 37:08.574
that Monroe Bennett tampered
with the president's medication?

37:08.617 --> 37:10.706
Not Bennett.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.274
It was his advisor,
Claire Rayburn.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.022
JUSTICE CHENG:
These are very serious
charges against someone

37:22.065 --> 37:23.545
not here to defend herself.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.808
I realize that, Your Honor.Do you have any

37:25.852 --> 37:27.636
information as to Ms. Rayburn's
current whereabouts?

37:32.032 --> 37:34.295
No, I don't.

37:34.339 --> 37:37.951
Claire Rayburn is in the wind.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.304
CROFT:
Liam, there you are.

37:43.348 --> 37:44.653
Come, come, come.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.615
CHANDRA:
Liam, congratulations.

37:49.658 --> 37:52.270
The 3-D printer just spit out
the beryllium fabric prototype

37:52.313 --> 37:53.793
for the solar sail.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.274
What do you think?

37:56.317 --> 37:58.798
I, uh...

37:58.841 --> 38:01.844
I think, um...

38:01.888 --> 38:03.019
I think...

38:03.063 --> 38:04.891
we're gonna
save the world.

38:15.771 --> 38:18.861
JUSTICE CHENG:
These are very serious charges

38:18.905 --> 38:20.733
against someone not here
to defend herself.

38:20.776 --> 38:22.082
Do you have any information

38:22.125 --> 38:23.736
as to Ms. Rayburn's
current whereabouts?

38:23.779 --> 38:25.738
No, I don't.

38:25.781 --> 38:28.480
Claire Rayburn is in the wind.

38:28.523 --> 38:30.351
NEWSWOMAN: Following Grace
Barrows' dramatic testimony,

38:30.395 --> 38:32.788
the justices retired...

38:43.233 --> 38:45.105
You rang, 'Lonzo?

38:45.148 --> 38:47.194
What you need?

38:47.237 --> 38:49.544
Other than a different planet
to live on.

38:49.588 --> 38:53.418
I need this small
fry decrypted.

39:06.082 --> 39:08.563
Just give me the bad news.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.478
Our White House Counsel
just got a call

39:10.522 --> 39:12.175
from a trusted source.
The justices

39:12.219 --> 39:13.916
seem split down the
middle, four-four.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.484
Chief Justice Cheng is
the swing vote, but...

39:16.528 --> 39:20.227
he was a Mackenzie appointee and
appears to be leaning our way.

39:20.270 --> 39:22.795
Okay. Let's not pop
any champagne yet.

39:22.838 --> 39:25.058
Okay. All right, but
when we do, I'm buying.

39:26.538 --> 39:28.583
Hey, it's all
over, Grace.

39:28.627 --> 39:31.107
Soon, we can finally
put this behind us.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.153
I hope you're right.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.637
The latest and greatest.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.900
Washed up on the Potomac
this morning.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.860
Another suicide?

39:44.904 --> 39:47.863
Not unless she shot herself
and then dumped her own body.

39:49.952 --> 39:53.869
MAUER:
That's Claire Rayburn.

39:59.745 --> 40:02.922
Still no word from Liam?

40:10.103 --> 40:12.279
Do you think he's in danger?

40:12.322 --> 40:14.281
Worse.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.588
I think he feels safe.

40:33.996 --> 40:36.782
ALYCIA:
The White House and Congress
are under siege.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.045
The Judicial branch is
in disarray.

40:39.088 --> 40:41.134
RE/SYST AVATAR: This chaos
only proves our point.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.179
That the world needs us
more than ever.

40:46.356 --> 40:49.316
CROWD :
Take her down! Take her down!

41:05.027 --> 41:06.202
Jessie.

41:06.246 --> 41:08.074
Everything okay out there?

41:08.117 --> 41:09.815
No.

41:09.858 --> 41:12.731
I'm sorry, but they
have my family.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.038
What was that?

41:16.082 --> 41:17.866
We are still awaiting word
from the FBI

41:17.910 --> 41:19.694
and the White House
as far as loss of life,

41:19.738 --> 41:21.696
extent of damage
and possible motive

41:21.740 --> 41:24.003
for this bombing,
but with the court divided

41:24.046 --> 41:27.006
four to four, and
Chief Justice Martin Cheng...Monsters.

41:27.049 --> 41:29.530
Soulless monsters.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.445
They found Justice
Cheng. He's alive,

41:31.489 --> 41:33.795
but in critical condition and
on his way to D.C. General.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.841
My God.
You're live on all
channels in ten minutes.

41:35.884 --> 41:38.496
Right.
This needs to be more
than a reassuring speech.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.149
We need civilians
off the street

41:40.193 --> 41:42.543
and a strong military presence
around the entire district.

41:42.587 --> 41:43.892
Lines are being drawn.

41:43.936 --> 41:45.677
Battle lines.Forget battle lines.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.027
The first shots have
just been fired on social media.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.681
NEWSWOMAN: ...from
President Monroe Bennett.

41:49.724 --> 41:53.554
Today, terrorists have declared
war on America.

41:53.598 --> 41:57.558
And those terrorists are Pauline
Mackenzie and Darius Tanz.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.865
They knew

41:59.908 --> 42:02.650
that Chief Justice Cheng
was gonna rule in my favor,

42:02.694 --> 42:04.696
and so they put out a hit
on him.

42:04.739 --> 42:07.916
They are coming for me next,
but I will not run.

42:07.960 --> 42:12.138
With your help,
I will stand, and I will fight.

42:12.181 --> 42:14.749
We will win this fight
in the streets,

42:14.793 --> 42:18.144
and we willtake back
ourcountry.

42:18.187 --> 42:21.147
Stand by, await instructions
and may God bless

42:21.190 --> 42:22.844
the United States of America.

42:22.888 --> 42:25.586
Bennett wanted chaos,
so he created it himself.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.588
This was his plan all along.It's time to call out

42:27.632 --> 42:29.938
the National Guard. Get tanks
and patrols on every street

42:29.982 --> 42:31.984
and set a perimeter.
Everything in a ten-block

42:32.027 --> 42:34.029
radius at the White House
is a no-go area.

42:34.073 --> 42:37.424
Yes, Mr. Secretary.
See to it. See to it now.

42:37.467 --> 42:39.644
This is Bennett's Fort Sumter.

42:39.687 --> 42:42.603
For the first time
since Abraham Lincoln,

42:42.647 --> 42:46.085
this country is going to war...
with itself.
