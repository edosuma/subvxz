WEBVTT

00:06.423 --> 00:09.086
Have you decided
how candid we're to be?

00:11.220 --> 00:12.677
My thought
was to avoid

00:12.763 --> 00:14.504
any mention of the creature.

00:15.641 --> 00:19.635
In trying to warn good people,
we'd only excite foolish ones.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.263
Can you imagine the bounty
the Admiralty would place

00:23.357 --> 00:24.689
on a creature like ours?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.562
I'd happily live in a world

00:26.652 --> 00:28.484
with a few less
foolish people in it.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.061
Mm.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.023
Every whaling ship in
Baffin Bay would head this way...

00:34.243 --> 00:38.032
...led by grubbing captains,
but with good men in their crews.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.407
We can't risk that.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.114
Our creature, you say?

00:41.208 --> 00:43.666
Whether we've earned him
or not.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.247
Well, you've decided
it's a "he", then.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.546
It is most definitely a "he".

01:18.620 --> 01:20.953
Graham died that very day.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.645
<i>It's in the muscles.</i>

01:50.736 --> 01:53.570
I'm tired all the time,
no matter what the hour.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.774
And I'm bleeding out of
the sockets of my teeth now.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.203
Have you contended
with it ever?

02:03.373 --> 02:04.739
No.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.790
And now?

02:08.086 --> 02:09.668
I can't be certain.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.465
To think these few miles
were an effort.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.838
You know, after the war...

02:17.554 --> 02:19.762
I asked permission
to walk home to London

02:19.848 --> 02:22.135
from Nanking,
through Tibet and Russia.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.677
I wanted to try my hand
at being an overland spy.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.730
I was the best walker
in the service.

02:31.693 --> 02:35.152
I told Sir John Barrow that
once without blushing.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.203
I was quick to want the world
rid of its fools an hour ago.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.998
I forget sometimes how much
an exemplar I am among them.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.246
That's not how I see you.

02:54.633 --> 02:58.923
Francis, do you know how I was
appointed to this expedition?

03:01.223 --> 03:04.057
I saved Sir John Barrow's son
from a scandal...

03:05.227 --> 03:07.139
...by chance, in Singapore.

03:08.522 --> 03:13.438
I paid... to have a very base
matter settled

03:13.527 --> 03:15.985
that would have blackened
the Barrows' name

03:16.071 --> 03:18.404
and the Admiralty's
by association.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.609
As soon as I returned to London
I was promoted to Commander.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.031
And when the Admiralty
announced

03:25.122 --> 03:27.580
that there would be another
attempt at the Passage...

03:29.042 --> 03:31.750
Well,
I only had to say the word.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.919
That only makes you a man.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.217
Does it?

03:40.303 --> 03:45.640
What you describe is a surplus
of political luck. Hmm?

03:47.519 --> 03:49.431
Not a dearth of courage.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.599
I'm a fake, brother.

03:57.487 --> 04:01.401
I challenge any biographer
to tally up your acts of valor

04:01.491 --> 04:02.652
and then call you a fake.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.904
Francis...

04:03.994 --> 04:08.705
a man like me... will do
amazing things to be seen.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.084
My... My father...

04:16.757 --> 04:20.000
My father was...
a ridiculous man.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.504
Ruined himself with debts.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.931
He was a consul general
in Brazil

04:27.017 --> 04:29.805
and... he and his wife would mix

04:29.895 --> 04:32.888
with all the wealthy Portuguese
families in exile there.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.352
My mother...

04:37.778 --> 04:40.441
was probably from
one of those families.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.112
I was never told more.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.276
I was born out of an affair.

04:50.332 --> 04:55.293
My father's cousins had to find
people to raise me.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.994
My name...

04:58.298 --> 05:01.587
even my name was made up
for my baptism.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.879
James... Fitzjames.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.054
Like a bad pun.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.849
I'm not even fully English.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.646
I didn't know any of that.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.033
I've never said it
out loud before now.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.335
I always felt I deserved more.

05:38.421 --> 05:42.882
So I went to sea, aged 12,
and I began to build myself

05:42.968 --> 05:47.178
a great... gilded life...

05:48.431 --> 05:51.299
...that didn't humiliate me
to live.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.473
So all of those stories

05:54.563 --> 05:57.556
you would have my biographer
tally as courage...

06:00.652 --> 06:02.735
...it's all vanity.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.234
Always has been.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.320
And we are at the end
of vanity.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.212
Then you are free. Hmm?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.927
Mine your courage
from a different lode now.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.262
Friendship.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.059
Brotherhood.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.229
Are we brothers, Francis?

06:43.028 --> 06:45.065
I would like that very much.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.385
The Marines are running.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.808
- Attacked? For what reason?
- Apparently,

07:57.894 --> 08:00.056
as soon as they sighted
Lt. Irving and Mr. Farr,

08:00.146 --> 08:02.729
they set upon them.
With knives.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.559
They were already at the sled
by the time we reached the hill

08:05.652 --> 08:08.065
with Mr. Hickey,
who'd alerted us.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.025
How many Netsilik were killed?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.323
Five.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.277
Who shot them?

08:16.371 --> 08:19.034
I shot two. Mr. Armitage two.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.410
Mr. Pocock one.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.162
One more escaped on foot.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.585
And that's why the Marines
are preparing...

08:24.671 --> 08:27.334
for a Netsilik retribution.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.087
What evidence did you
observe, when you arrived,

08:30.176 --> 08:32.259
that an attack on our men
had taken place?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.553
I saw what they'd done, sir.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.928
When you first set eyes
on the Esquimaux,

08:38.018 --> 08:41.886
were their weapons drawn,
blood on their persons?

08:41.980 --> 08:44.313
Sir, Lt. Irving
and Mr. Farr's bodies

08:44.399 --> 08:45.856
were put through something

08:45.942 --> 08:47.729
I can't even find
English words for.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.900
I didn't look for confirmation
of something

08:51.990 --> 08:53.902
that can only have been done
by savage men.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.361
I ordered our counter-attack.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.743
They had some of Lt. Irving's
personal belongings

09:01.833 --> 09:03.165
already on their sled, sir.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.288
Captain, do I have
your permission

09:05.378 --> 09:07.665
to assist the Marines
in getting a perimeter set up,

09:07.756 --> 09:09.167
with additional guns and men?

09:10.550 --> 09:14.134
And it was Mr. Hickey
who saw the attack happen?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.758
From a distance, yes.

09:16.848 --> 09:20.808
He saw Lt. Irving murdered
and ran to retrieve us.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.596
He was unarmed and...
and too far to help Mr. Farr.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.398
Only he saw it?

09:28.485 --> 09:29.646
Yes, sir.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.570
Shall I fetch him here
to give his own account?

09:37.535 --> 09:39.401
I want to see the bodies.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.200
Find Lady Silence.
Bring her here.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.960
<i>The rocks
were painted with it.</i>

10:40.056 --> 10:43.470
And Lt. Irving...
lying in that way...

10:47.063 --> 10:48.804
...no longer a man.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.529
These people will not be
our friends, boys.

10:58.074 --> 11:02.944
They'll be our murderers,
if we don't change course now.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.161
Sergeant Tozer told me
he heard Dr. MacDonald say

11:07.250 --> 11:11.369
Netsiliks settle in groups
of 20 to 50 families.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.626
What's that? Maybe... 100 braves

11:14.716 --> 11:16.708
could be heading
for this camp as we speak.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.839
I'm not a decent shot
personally, but if I was...

11:19.929 --> 11:23.343
Mr. Hickey. The Captain's
asked to speak with you.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.679
I was just coming to see him,
Jopson.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.226
We need to speak immediately.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.061
Don't also forget your
overthings, Mr. Hickey.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.858
You're gonna need them.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.401
You're going back.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.618
Dr. Goodsir and Lady Silence
can join us.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.170
They may be able to discern
something I cannot.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.667
Anyone else?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.420
Sir.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.676
It'll limber me up

12:00.762 --> 12:03.049
for the next 800 miles
you're making me walk.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.881
Pardon my asking again, sir,

12:05.975 --> 12:08.262
but are we supplementing
the Marines or not?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.936
They want to build a proper
perimeter, with or without us.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.309
They are us, Edward.
Remind them.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.894
Give Sergeant Tozer as many
pairs of eyes as he wants.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.353
But as long as the fog holds off,

12:19.447 --> 12:21.279
have the armory tent
prepare fast kits.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.153
- But don't arm additional men.
- Yes, but...

12:23.243 --> 12:26.077
Do you not remember flogging men
on this expedition for sedition?

12:26.162 --> 12:29.576
Francis... you should set off.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.374
The forenoon watch
has already begun.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.500
Lieutenant, keep the men ready

12:40.593 --> 12:42.425
in case Mr. Hickey
is telling the truth.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.629
But calm... in case he's not.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.608
Mr. Des Voeux, as you were.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.004
I'll be back by afternoon watch
if you need more volunteers, Sergeant.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.339
Today may be the day.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.969
Guns.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.235
You should trade
your work gloves

13:42.322 --> 13:45.656
for full mittens for a while,
if you can tolerate that.

13:46.743 --> 13:50.111
I've a weaker salve that I can give you
that you can put on all day underneath.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.832
- Are you cold, Mr. Collins?
- I'm all right.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.964
Just... let that sit
for a few minutes,

14:02.050 --> 14:03.712
and I'll be back to wipe away
the excess.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.672
Is Dr. Goodsir here?

14:25.114 --> 14:27.401
Are we to be overrun,
do you think?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.779
From the reaction
of our captains,

14:29.869 --> 14:31.781
my sense tells me we will not.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.330
Fear tells me something else.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.123
We have too much fear, John.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.414
Apart from the headaches,
and your teeth,

14:43.508 --> 14:45.716
have you noticed anything else?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.670
Bruises, mainly.
I've been getting them

14:48.763 --> 14:50.971
where I don't remember
knocking into anything.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.889
But they don't hurt.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.552
Have you got one
you can show me?

15:09.534 --> 15:11.446
Be with you in a moment,
Mr. Collins.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.622
How many of these
would you say you have then?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.335
More than a dozen?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.089
Henry...

15:26.175 --> 15:27.837
I want you to mind
what I tell you.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.261
It's not quick, this, and you
can turn it around in a day.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.966
It's the first signs, this.
It's early days for you.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.804
And Captain Crozier wouldn't
be sending out hunting parties

15:39.897 --> 15:41.729
if he didn't think
it was worth doing.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.650
No. No, he wouldn't.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.821
Now, I'm here.
Dr. Goodsir's here.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.614
And you can come back
when he's returned

15:51.701 --> 15:53.613
and he can reassure you anew.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.560
The Esquimaux ran off
in which direction, Mr. Hickey?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.781
Thomas...

18:02.582 --> 18:04.574
Gentlemen.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.454
Mr. Hickey...

18:07.920 --> 18:09.661
...could you show me
where Lt. Irving

18:09.755 --> 18:11.337
and Mr. Farr were killed,
please?

18:29.984 --> 18:33.102
Come on. Come on.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.491
If I was them,

19:21.577 --> 19:25.321
I'd be back behind those raised
bars to the south a mile out,

19:25.414 --> 19:28.623
waiting for this to get
just a bit worse.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.501
If we're gonna be cut down
today,

19:31.587 --> 19:33.795
I'd be grateful for a shotgun.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.372
I want a fighting chance

19:35.466 --> 19:39.005
of killing at least as many
of them as kill me.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.509
You've heard things, then?
Out in the fog, have you?

19:42.598 --> 19:45.341
- Not as yet.
- Yes.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.926
I have, sir.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.353
I almost rang the alarm
just now.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.646
You've only just arrived.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.566
Shales, sliding around
as if underfoot.

19:54.652 --> 19:58.612
A whistle, maybe,
quarter-of-a-mile out possibly.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.066
It's hard to tell in this fog.
We just have our ears now.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.242
Out there.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.286
That way.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.537
You heard that whistle,
too, then?

20:17.842 --> 20:19.754
There it is again, Sergeant.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.966
Damn it all.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.901
You know what I'm asking.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.952
And I know it's unfair
to even pose the question

21:30.039 --> 21:32.281
to another officer,
and one who wasn't there.

21:34.919 --> 21:38.754
All we have are our instincts
and training.

21:38.839 --> 21:42.298
If both told you to proceed
with what you ordered...

21:42.384 --> 21:44.296
then be easy with yourself.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.096
My mother's cousin
had a relation

21:48.182 --> 21:50.094
who married a Texas man.

21:50.184 --> 21:53.097
She moved to a territory town
there called Victoria in '38.

21:53.187 --> 21:56.680
One morning they woke up
to 600 Comanches

21:56.774 --> 21:59.482
screaming through their gates.
They had no warning.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.854
From what my cousin was told,

22:00.945 --> 22:03.904
this good lady managed to get
all but one of her children

22:03.989 --> 22:06.106
under the house
before they seized her.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.160
A Ranger found her in a tree
six days later,

22:10.246 --> 22:11.532
with her skirts torn off

22:11.622 --> 22:15.491
and her head cleaved open to
the stem. That town was burned,

22:15.584 --> 22:18.327
as were several more
over the next week.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.584
They never found the other child.
They kill children, you realize.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.838
Find Commander Fitzjames
and send him to the armory. Immediately!

22:24.927 --> 22:27.169
Make way. Move your backs.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.930
Everyone stand still!

22:34.687 --> 22:37.600
- Where's Commander Fitzjames?
- Haven't seen him, sir.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.773
Then it was not he
who made this order.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.270
There was no order, sir.

22:42.820 --> 22:46.689
An attack is being staged right
now using that fog as cover.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.398
My men can hear it.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.949
And you allowed this?

22:50.035 --> 22:51.742
Without knowing their numbers

22:51.829 --> 22:54.037
and having no familiarity
with their tactics,

22:54.123 --> 22:57.241
our gun power
is our only advantage.

22:57.334 --> 23:00.873
This camp has no cover
whatsoever.

23:02.006 --> 23:05.420
Who knows if the Eski girl's
been sending them signals

23:05.509 --> 23:07.967
as to what we're all about?

23:08.053 --> 23:12.798
If they come, they will
blow through us like a wind.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.016
Perhaps you'd like
to make the order, sir.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.317
The time is now.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.491
Mr. Armitage, do not scrimp
on that logbook.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.320
I want to see a record of every
issue taking place here.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.290
Sharpen up!

24:12.201 --> 24:14.067
All right, Mr. Collins.

24:36.684 --> 24:40.143
Damn your eyes!
It's your Captain!

24:41.230 --> 24:43.347
Avast that now!

24:46.026 --> 24:47.938
Sir!

24:52.157 --> 24:53.944
Get yourselves fed, men.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.367
Those were some long miles.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.366
Hartnell, take that
to the command tent.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.578
Goodsir.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.592
- The armory's been opened up.
- No, James. How?

25:12.678 --> 25:14.840
Lt. Little gave the order.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.546
The men believe
we are under attack.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.303
We are.
Of the most cowardly kind.

25:19.393 --> 25:22.181
I stepped in but 20 arms
had already been issued.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.435
If she enters that camp again,
Francis...

25:26.525 --> 25:30.644
We have to get this matchstick
away from the tinderbox.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.570
But Mr. Hickey's
gone in already.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.522
He'll tell them we're back.

25:34.616 --> 25:38.576
I'll go on ahead and misdirect
them, then. Lieutenant.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.743
Jopson.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.244
Your things.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.487
Wait, wait!

26:24.416 --> 26:26.328
Yes, go. Be safe.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.372
Stay with us.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.423
I'll...

26:34.510 --> 26:38.003
I'll... I'll talk to the men
and... and make it safe for you.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.138
We owe you that.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.057
I... I do.

26:45.479 --> 26:48.643
I... I wish you could come
to England and see for yourself.

26:48.732 --> 26:51.691
It's not like we are here.
People there are good.

26:51.777 --> 26:54.269
They are good...

27:38.115 --> 27:40.607
Make certain the following
people are armed.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.943
The two of you, Mr. Des Voeux,

27:43.036 --> 27:46.655
Golding, Hoar, Mr. Thompson,
Mr. Crispe,

27:46.748 --> 27:48.910
Mr. Kenley, and Mr. Coombs.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.744
When we depart,
we'll be taking a boat sledge.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.545
Manson, find out
which one is lightest

27:54.631 --> 27:57.840
and make sure
there are slops and harnesses.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.589
We may have no more interaction
with this larger group,

28:00.679 --> 28:02.090
so if we do go today,
we must take

28:02.181 --> 28:03.513
everything we need with us.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.340
Do you know how to read maps
and charts, Billy?

28:05.434 --> 28:06.891
Reasonably.

28:06.977 --> 28:09.185
Find an occasion
to be in the command tent.

28:09.271 --> 28:12.480
Secure one batch indicating
where the ships are stuck in

28:12.566 --> 28:14.933
all the way down
to Great Slave Lake.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.110
Burn any others.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.489
You'll have the entire rest
of your long lives

28:21.575 --> 28:24.568
to think back on how hard
this day was.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.204
For now, only do...

28:29.333 --> 28:30.869
...and do well.

28:31.919 --> 28:34.036
We need men
in the north outpost.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.963
If you've not been given orders
by a Marine, head there.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.335
Be quick!

28:38.425 --> 28:41.259
I thought I made
a very clear plan.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.632
And for very clear reasons.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.681
It was the fog.
It changed my thinking, sir.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.726
I... I thought you'd see it
differently as well.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.929
Commander Fitzjames
ought to have made that call.

28:53.023 --> 28:56.141
- Why did you not include him?
- There was no time, sir.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.646
I'd heard there were signs...

28:57.736 --> 28:59.693
Some of the men
heard things out in the fog.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.237
Which men?

29:01.323 --> 29:03.235
Were you one of them?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.110
No doubt you made
the best decision

29:07.204 --> 29:09.571
for the problem
you thought you had.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.037
But, as it turns out,
it was trumpery.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.709
And in its place,
we've an even worse problem.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.254
You've traded an imaginary
invasion from without

29:18.340 --> 29:20.457
for a real invasion
from within!

29:20.550 --> 29:24.669
If Mr. Hickey killed Lt. Irving
and Mr. Farr,

29:24.763 --> 29:28.302
as I suspect he did,
it was not for the joy of it.

29:29.977 --> 29:32.310
We do not know yet
who is in his coven,

29:32.396 --> 29:36.140
but make no mistake
about what they want.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.942
What is our evidence
against him?

29:51.498 --> 29:55.287
...but don't turn
your back on them, ever.

29:59.464 --> 30:03.378
Dr. Goodsir. I want you
to cut open Irving's stomach.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.710
Good.

30:40.255 --> 30:45.000
That's seal meat, sir.
Barely digested.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.675
They fed him.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.046
Of course they did.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.393
Will you confirm
this contradicts

30:55.479 --> 30:57.596
Mr. Hickey's version of events

30:57.689 --> 31:00.147
and is indisputable proof
of a lie...

31:00.233 --> 31:02.270
that resulted in
seven deaths...

31:03.278 --> 31:05.565
...including a Naval officer
and a child?

31:07.574 --> 31:09.691
He must have been alone,
Mr. Farr.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.493
Lt. Irving must have come back
to tell them about the meat.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.821
Hodgson, will you confirm it?

31:15.791 --> 31:19.375
Oh, my God. Yes. I will.

31:19.461 --> 31:22.954
Find three armed Marines
and arrest Mr. Hickey now.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.289
Not Marines, sir.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.797
It was Sergeant Tozer
who armed the men, in fact.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.879
I took his story
and made it my order.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.554
I thought I was doing right.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.349
I'm the worst kind of sorry,
sir.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.099
Choose men we can trust.

31:44.194 --> 31:45.730
Deputize them.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.687
Sweep the camp.

31:47.781 --> 31:51.946
Anyone below a wardroom officer
disarm, including the Marines.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.492
Put one of the mates in charge
of the armory.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.992
Des Voeux.

31:59.334 --> 32:03.578
Arrest Sergeant Tozer and
Mr. Hickey at the same moment.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.504
Bring them.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.128
We'll court martial them here.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.175
And find the carpenters.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.379
Carpenters, sir?

32:13.390 --> 32:15.131
For a gallows.

32:21.273 --> 32:25.108
<i>Terror</i> camp clear!
<i>Terror</i> camp is clear!

32:25.193 --> 32:27.310
I hope I won't be long,
Mr. Bridgens.

32:27.404 --> 32:29.396
I pray this will be brief.

32:29.489 --> 32:33.358
All men are to assemble at
the south guard post in 30 minutes!

32:34.661 --> 32:37.779
Who's been asking for
the Peruvian, Mr. Bridgens?

32:38.582 --> 32:39.948
This is very strong.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.158
I haven't even given
a dose of that to anyone.

32:42.252 --> 32:43.663
What cure is it?

32:44.838 --> 32:47.125
Cocaine and wine.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.732
Where's Sergeant Tozer
being held?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.987
You're lucky you weren't just
shot back there, Mr. Hickey.

33:17.662 --> 33:21.372
Do you have a sudden gift
for aim, Jopson?

33:21.458 --> 33:24.371
Everything we ate growing up
started with a gun.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.207
My aim's fine, Mr. Hickey.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.214
I've shot smaller hawks
than you.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.141
We'll proceed first

33:45.232 --> 33:48.066
with Petty Officer
Cornelius Hickey,

33:48.151 --> 33:51.861
who has been convicted today
of the wanton murders...

33:52.864 --> 33:58.326
...of Lt. John Irving
and Petty Officer Thomas Farr.

33:58.411 --> 34:01.279
Ample evidence has been stated
before Command

34:01.373 --> 34:04.707
so as to suggest Mr. Hickey's
guilt well proven.

34:05.627 --> 34:08.119
With that proof
comes confirmation

34:08.213 --> 34:11.581
of the next, more pernicious
charges...

34:11.675 --> 34:14.759
of sedition
and mutinous designs.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.723
These charges
are all punishable by death.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.226
And at Captain Crozier's
discretion...

34:24.312 --> 34:27.054
the sentence will be
carried out by hanging

34:27.148 --> 34:29.891
before the men now assembled.

34:30.985 --> 34:34.696
Mr. Hickey and Sergeant Tozer
will be given last words.

34:34.781 --> 34:38.024
But, first, your Captain
would like to speak.

34:54.801 --> 34:58.966
When we abandoned ship,
I promised you men two things.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.637
The first was that help was
already on its way to us

35:03.727 --> 35:05.684
back from Fort Resolution

35:05.770 --> 35:09.104
with Lt. Fairholm and the party
I sent out last summer.

35:11.359 --> 35:14.693
We now know those men are dead.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.271
I found them on watch

35:17.365 --> 35:19.778
and Captain Crozier had me
swear an oath of silence.

35:19.868 --> 35:23.282
Which you broke. Now be quiet.
You'll get a chance to speak.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.958
Sergeant Tozer and Mr. Morfin
discovered this two days ago,

35:29.044 --> 35:32.208
as only some of you
already know.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.414
I decided not to share it.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.965
I own that decision
and would make it again.

35:37.052 --> 35:40.762
Not to deceive you,
but to protect your reserves.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.297
But now we know,

35:43.391 --> 35:45.599
now we all know...

35:46.645 --> 35:48.511
...no one is coming for us...

35:49.689 --> 35:54.855
...we must get ourselves out
under our own steam.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.028
Now, I don't know what
Mr. Hickey's plan was,

35:58.114 --> 36:00.697
but I know it didn't include
all of you.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.197
And those of you
who might have gone with him,

36:03.286 --> 36:04.822
I can promise you,

36:04.913 --> 36:07.496
he would have burned
through you like fuel.

36:08.792 --> 36:12.877
Lied to you and used you
down to your last muscle.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.173
And here's how I know.

36:19.094 --> 36:22.007
Mr. Diggle, will you open
these, please,

36:22.097 --> 36:24.134
and tell the men what's inside.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.852
It's fresh, sir.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.478
Louder, so they can all hear.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.651
It's fresh meat.

36:37.737 --> 36:38.853
What kind of meat?

36:38.947 --> 36:41.189
Seal, sir.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.818
Thank you.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.484
The other promise I made
to all of you

36:45.578 --> 36:47.786
was that when we crossed paths
with the Netsilik,

36:47.872 --> 36:49.079
that they would help us.

36:49.165 --> 36:51.953
Lt. Irving met them.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.626
And do you know
what they did to him?

36:55.213 --> 36:56.954
Dr. Goodsir, would you, please?

36:58.133 --> 36:59.465
They fed him.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.920
They fed him.

37:06.683 --> 37:09.266
They didn't cut him down
and deface him.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.639
That was Mr. Hickey.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.437
They didn't slice off
his man parts

37:13.523 --> 37:16.231
and punch 23 holes into his
lungs with a boat knife.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.434
That was Mr. Hickey!

37:20.321 --> 37:24.156
They were no war party,
those Esquimaux.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.651
They were more of a family,
it seemed.

37:26.745 --> 37:30.910
Four men, an old woman...
and a girl.

37:31.916 --> 37:35.910
A little girl.
No more than six years old.

37:38.465 --> 37:41.003
Mr. Hickey lied to you.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.836
Mr. Hickey lied to all of you

37:44.929 --> 37:47.012
because he needed to cut
the legs out

37:47.098 --> 37:49.636
from under my leadership.
And in so doing,

37:49.726 --> 37:53.094
he was prepared to set
all your lives swinging.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.646
Now we will share this meat.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.098
Dr. Goodsir.

37:57.192 --> 38:00.685
But that line of help
has been cut off from us now.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.112
We will find another, no doubt,

38:03.198 --> 38:07.488
but not with gammoning dogs
like this among us.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.157
Hear me, men.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.955
I take no pleasure
in these deaths today.

38:14.042 --> 38:18.161
I want to bring
every last one of you home.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.496
But if I cannot
bring these two,

38:20.590 --> 38:23.503
then I am only doubly resolute
about the rest of you.

38:25.303 --> 38:29.092
Now, before we hear
Mr. Hickey's last words,

38:29.182 --> 38:31.970
I have one more request
to make of you.

38:35.271 --> 38:38.560
I need volunteers
to man the rope.

38:41.945 --> 38:44.187
You two, come forward.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.500
Mr. Hickey.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.051
Yeah.

39:08.137 --> 39:10.971
I've let the Captain speak now
long enough...

39:12.767 --> 39:16.431
telling every manner
of falsehood against me.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.560
Proving only...

39:21.484 --> 39:25.728
...every man... lies.

39:26.990 --> 39:30.404
Even this man. Your Captain.

39:31.828 --> 39:36.368
But I must pierce this thing
he calls truth

39:36.457 --> 39:39.700
with another of his own
recent deceptions.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.708
June the 11th last year,

39:43.798 --> 39:46.085
the day Sir John was killed,

39:47.427 --> 39:49.589
something else transpired.

39:51.139 --> 39:54.007
Crozier made a plan...

39:56.102 --> 39:57.843
...in secret...

39:59.814 --> 40:03.478
...to get himself out...
without you.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.941
There are many feats

40:08.031 --> 40:09.897
that preoccupy

40:09.991 --> 40:12.074
a Captain's imagination...

40:13.953 --> 40:15.865
But abandoning his ship...

40:16.706 --> 40:20.074
...and his men...
should not be among them.

40:22.128 --> 40:25.712
"Yet I hereby tender my..."

40:26.674 --> 40:29.007
Oh, go on, Captain,
you finish it.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.796
Who is that?

40:40.355 --> 40:41.937
Mr. Collins.

40:49.739 --> 40:51.526
He's right here!

40:58.164 --> 40:59.655
Mr. Hickey!

41:00.500 --> 41:03.288
The armory.
That's where they'll go.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.920
Mr. Blanky, with me!

41:22.355 --> 41:25.063
Just give me as many
as you can. Break the lock off.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.819
Take Tozer!

41:32.949 --> 41:35.692
Keep going. Get every man
you can onto the boats.

41:35.785 --> 41:37.321
It's the only cover we have.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.495
Mr. Blanky, get to cover.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.697
Neptune's balls,
I'm coming with you.

41:43.376 --> 41:45.288
- Down.
- Keep moving!

41:45.378 --> 41:47.085
- Get down!
- Stay down!

41:50.925 --> 41:52.712
It's just there!

41:55.722 --> 41:57.714
Billy, I...

41:58.641 --> 42:01.304
Remember what he told you.
Just do. Yeah? Yeah?

42:26.377 --> 42:29.586
Find Mr. Goodsir, bring
him to the boat. We won't wait.

42:38.264 --> 42:41.007
- Where is it?
- Stay quiet till it's over.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.770
Help me...

43:28.856 --> 43:31.815
Now's the time, Mr. Des Voeux!
It's on the far side of camp.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.772
Boat secure.

43:38.908 --> 43:40.570
What is this?

43:48.626 --> 43:50.333
Tozer!

43:52.880 --> 43:54.621
Lay down those arms.

43:55.675 --> 43:57.337
Where are the Marines?

43:58.261 --> 43:59.718
Come with us, Lieutenant.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.215
I'll not tell you again.

44:02.723 --> 44:05.591
No one can see you now.
You're invisible.

44:05.685 --> 44:07.847
They'll think you've died
and been carried off.

44:07.937 --> 44:09.348
Get on the ground.

44:09.438 --> 44:13.273
Hickey didn't get to say half
of what he wanted to say...

44:14.318 --> 44:15.900
...Edward.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.195
That's your name, isn't it?
Edward?

44:19.615 --> 44:24.701
Crozier was gonna lead that
sledge party himself and leave.

44:26.372 --> 44:29.456
Quit the Navy, quit all of us.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.752
You didn't know that, did you?

44:34.714 --> 44:39.709
He was gonna leave you
a big losing hand, Edward.

44:41.095 --> 44:42.211
Watch out.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.881
Mr. Blanky, it's Mr. Reid.

45:17.882 --> 45:19.874
I lost him.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.175
They're both gone.

45:22.261 --> 45:25.049
Tozer's with them.
They have at least five guns.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.721
Here you are.

45:36.442 --> 45:37.899
Let them go.
