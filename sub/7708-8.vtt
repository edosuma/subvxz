WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:03.268
Huh.

00:03.270 --> 00:04.403
Well, here's an expression

00:04.405 --> 00:06.805
I'm not often called on to use

00:06.807 --> 00:10.309
ALF, your dinner's getting cold.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.444
¶ Uncle Neal has gone away ¶

00:12.446 --> 00:14.813
¶ Doo-da doo-da ¶

00:14.815 --> 00:17.116
¶ I can eat out here today ¶

00:17.118 --> 00:18.684
¶ All doo-day long ¶

00:18.686 --> 00:19.685
Everybody!

00:19.687 --> 00:21.053
¶ Gonna eat all day-- ¶¶

00:21.055 --> 00:25.124
ALF, I really don't appreciate
that at all.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.525
Okay. Then you wanna hear

00:26.527 --> 00:28.761
how I changed the words
to "Helter Skelter"?

00:30.097 --> 00:32.131
No.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.399
I'm gonna miss him.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.700
It was fun having
Uncle Neal around.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.368
Hmm. Well, he's just
down the street.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.803
You can go visit him.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.539
I know he's really lonely
since Margaret left him.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.275
Hey, he had a bad marriage.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.177
Who hasn't, right, Willie?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.516
What's Uncle Neal's new
apartment like?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.684
Much too close to this house.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.454
It's nice. It's small

00:55.456 --> 00:58.557
but at least he has more room
than he had in the camper.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.526
I thought the camper was neat.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.228
It had a toilet
right in the shower.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.663
So do we.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.200
Oh, what?
Like you've never done it?

01:10.271 --> 01:13.105
[theme music]

02:11.832 --> 02:13.932
(Kate)
'And here's an old iron
if you don't already have one.'

02:13.934 --> 02:18.203
But be careful because
the squirter is broken.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.838
I'm touched.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.107
Oh, Neal, it's just an old iron.

02:22.109 --> 02:26.612
No, this is the one
I gave you for your wedding.

02:26.614 --> 02:30.482
Oh. Oh, my gosh,
I think.. I think it is.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.151
[chuckles]
I'm sorry.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.585
Oh, don't be.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.220
What goes around,
comes around.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.722
Thank you.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.457
Well, ready for another load.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.592
Oh, right over there, Willie.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.728
You guys have been
so good to me.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.630
Thanks to you,
I have my own apartment

02:44.632 --> 02:47.332
and I'm embarking
on a whole new adventure.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.534
You know something?

02:48.536 --> 02:51.170
That is the perfect attitude.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.538
Right.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.207
So you guys want
to sleep over tonight?

02:55.209 --> 02:59.044
As tempting
as the offer sounds, Neal..

02:59.046 --> 03:02.681
Willie, you feel like
sleeping over at Neal's tonight?

03:02.683 --> 03:06.885
Uh, thanks, Neal, but no.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.887
If you need us though,
for anything

03:08.889 --> 03:11.390
anything at all,
just feel free to call.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.125
Oh, please.

03:13.127 --> 03:16.295
Haven't you done enough already
with all these lovely things?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.732
Thank you.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.068
You've gotta stop thanking us.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.102
Oh.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.237
I know.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.272
Thank you for pointing that out.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.341
Oh, I almost forgot.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.542
I got a job.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.344
Oh, that is good to hear.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.313
Yeah. Thank God, right?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.415
What is it? Tell us.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.849
Well, my landlady
happened to mention

03:37.851 --> 03:39.518
that she needs a new handyman.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.553
It pays zip
and only covers half my rent

03:41.555 --> 03:44.022
so naturally,
I snapped at it.

03:44.024 --> 03:48.560
But, Neal, you've always been
so clumsy with tools.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.531
You remember
that band-saw mishap.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.233
Willie, Grandpa
forgave me for that.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.501
Why can't you?

03:56.503 --> 03:58.003
Neal.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.772
Neal, have you thought
this thing through?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.542
Shouldn't a handyman have at
least a nodding acquaintance

04:03.544 --> 04:04.843
with how to fix things?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.545
Well, with any luck
the building will be

04:06.547 --> 04:08.080
in really great shape.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.249
If not, I'll be
in really big trouble.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.650
I'll make do.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.552
- I think it's great, Neal.
- Yeah.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.054
Well, I guess I better go get
started on my great new life.

04:16.056 --> 04:19.391
Are you sure you guys don't
wanna stay over tonight?

04:19.393 --> 04:21.860
Honey, last chance.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.229
- We'll take a rain check.
- Good.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.277
- Hi, ALF.
- Don't you believe in knocking?

04:40.147 --> 04:41.813
No door.

04:41.815 --> 04:45.217
Well, what if you caught me
at an awkward moment?

04:45.219 --> 04:49.321
Let's just be grateful
that that hasn't happened.

04:49.323 --> 04:52.658
So to what do I owe
the pleasure of your company?

04:52.660 --> 04:54.993
Oh, I was just, uh..

04:54.995 --> 04:57.229
I was looking around
for some other things

04:57.231 --> 05:01.066
that Neal might be able to use
in his new apartment.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.434
Yeah.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.170
No, don't take those.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.605
Why not?

05:06.607 --> 05:09.241
Well, I was planning
on using them.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.677
Someday.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.211
When I got married.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.383
If the day ever comes
that you get married..

05:18.385 --> 05:22.988
I promise you, I'll buy you
a whole new set of saucepans.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.924
And I'll dance on them.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.694
It could happen.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.029
Look at Anne Bancroft
and Mel Brooks.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.233
He could have anybody he wants.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.440
No, not that.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.874
You can't give him that.

05:42.876 --> 05:47.713
Well, ALF, this is just
an old fan.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.749
It's not just any old fan.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.185
I use it to scrape my calluses.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.156
Keep it.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.993
Well, if you see anything else
you like,

06:01.995 --> 06:04.863
by all means, take it.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.799
Say, what's your problem,
anyway?

06:07.801 --> 06:11.103
Ever since Neal showed up, you
made me feel about as welcome

06:11.105 --> 06:14.406
as a low doorknob
at a nudist colony.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.444
Neal is getting his own
apartment now, ALF.

06:19.446 --> 06:22.013
Hopefully things will be
returning to normal here.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.915
I should think
that would make you happy.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.317
(Neal)
'Willie, you up there?'

06:25.319 --> 06:26.551
- No.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.253
I mean, yeah.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.422
- Under the bed.
- Okay, I will.

06:30.424 --> 06:34.359
And I won't let this degrade me
at all, in case you're worried.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.866
Morning, Willie.
I thought I heard you up here.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.667
Yeah, yeah.

06:42.669 --> 06:46.271
I was just looking for some more
stuff for your new apartment.

06:46.273 --> 06:49.641
What, are you taking
in boarders now?

06:49.643 --> 06:52.411
Oh, that bed is Brian's old bed.

06:52.413 --> 06:55.514
You know how attached kids can
get to their old furniture.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.182
Especially after they wet it.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.155
Well, it's nice to know
you've stuck to the old values.

07:05.159 --> 07:07.459
Oh, hey, I could really use
this, Willie.

07:08.061 --> 07:08.927
[clicks]

07:08.929 --> 07:10.395
¶ Like a virgin ¶

07:10.397 --> 07:13.832
¶ Touched for the very
first time ¶

07:13.834 --> 07:16.401
¶ Like a virgin.. ¶¶

07:19.673 --> 07:21.540
The speed's all off.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.976
You don't want that.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.779
Oh, hey, it's your old
Clairmont High yearbook.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.147
Yeah.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.283
I know. Let's look at it later.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.685
That's where
I first met Margaret.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.420
Future Farmers.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.855
I know.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.124
Boy, that gal could
really take down a steer.

07:41.395 --> 07:44.162
Funny what first attracts
you to a woman.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.065
Let's, uh..

07:47.067 --> 07:48.700
Let's go look in the garage, eh?

07:48.702 --> 07:50.268
Willie, you gotta stop sometime.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.270
I only have a one-bedroom
apartment.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.472
[chuckles]

07:58.479 --> 07:59.811
[groans]

07:59.813 --> 08:02.380
If he wasn't the brother
of my meal ticket

08:02.382 --> 08:04.149
I'd clean his clock.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.959
ALF, everybody, dinner's ready.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.063
So to what do I owe the honor

08:18.065 --> 08:21.566
of being asked
to dine at your table?

08:21.568 --> 08:25.070
Oh, stop being so dramatic
and get in your seat.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.873
Neal finally decided
to eat at his place tonight.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.810
It's been so long since
I was allowed to eat with you.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.745
Which seat is mine?

08:33.747 --> 08:37.082
It's.. It's all so hazy.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.952
You can always eat
upstairs, you know.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.822
I took a guess.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.824
ALF, what are you doing here?

08:45.826 --> 08:47.359
I used to be a phenomenon.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.995
Now I'm reduced to a,
"What are you doing here?"

08:52.599 --> 08:54.099
What's he doing here?

08:54.101 --> 08:56.668
I was invited,
if you don't mind.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.136
Check your guest list.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.705
You mean Uncle Neal's
not coming?

09:00.707 --> 09:01.840
Please.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.675
The warmth is suffocating.

09:03.677 --> 09:07.612
- ALF.
- I was invited!

09:07.614 --> 09:09.014
I was just gonna say

09:09.016 --> 09:11.883
I'm glad you were able
to join us.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.084
Oh.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.686
Well, thank you.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.221
Now, shall we dine?

09:17.524 --> 09:20.859
So, Brian,
what grade are you in now?

09:20.861 --> 09:23.161
ALF, you haven't
been up there that long.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.963
Well, it's hard
to keep track of time

09:24.965 --> 09:27.399
when there's no light.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.068
- I've missed these dinners.
- Me too, babe.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.670
[doorbell dings]

09:31.672 --> 09:34.372
(Neal)
'It's Neal.'

09:34.374 --> 09:38.076
I thought I felt a sudden chill.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.646
Will you please
just go to the kitchen?

09:41.648 --> 09:43.982
Stay, go, stay, go.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.585
I could be a police dog
after this.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.957
- Hey, Neal.
- Hi, Willie.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.625
- Hi, everybody.
- 'Hey, Uncle Neal.'

09:53.627 --> 09:56.261
Oh, gosh, you're having dinner.
I can come back at another time.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.030
- No, no, no.
- Uh, what's going on?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.266
I got my first fix-it job
at the building

10:01.268 --> 10:03.635
and I thought I might need
a few more tools.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.203
What do you have?

10:05.205 --> 10:08.373
Well, I have a Swiss Army knife
and a mess of good intentions.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.142
I'll, uh..
I'll see what I've got.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.577
Oh, thanks.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.479
Why don't you go ahead
and finish your dinner?

10:14.481 --> 10:16.081
I can get it myself.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.083
Neal, would you like to join
us for dinner?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.818
Oh, no. No, thank you.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.453
I couldn't impose.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.855
Besides, you must be
expecting somebody.

10:23.857 --> 10:27.559
No. Actually, no,
we were hoping you'd stop by.

10:27.561 --> 10:28.660
Oh.

10:28.662 --> 10:31.229
Well, if it's not
too much trouble.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.198
Oh, don't be silly.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.801
Then I guess I should
probably go tell...Meatloaf.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.069
Get the meatloaf.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.872
I'll just go get the meatloaf.

10:40.874 --> 10:44.175
You know, meatloaf, that
was Margaret's favorite meal.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.610
Sometimes on a Sunday

10:45.612 --> 10:49.014
she'd make four or five pounds
of it at a time.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.482
And then she'd freeze it?

10:50.484 --> 10:51.683
No.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.054
He's never leaving.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.989
He knows a good thing.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.559
He's like a fly
on a meadow muffin.

11:01.561 --> 11:04.329
Look, ALF, as soon as Uncle Neal
gets a full-time job

11:04.331 --> 11:07.065
and makes a few friends,
he won't be around so much.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.667
You'll see.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.302
Well, it's time I took
a stand around here.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.005
Either he goes or I go.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.106
[Willie laughing]

11:15.108 --> 11:16.307
[Kate laughing]

11:16.309 --> 11:19.010
(Kate)
'Oh, Neal.'

11:19.012 --> 11:21.246
And it looks like
the I's have it.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.427
Hi.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.696
- Morning, sweetheart.
- Good morning, Willie.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.164
[crash]

11:39.166 --> 11:41.266
- Good Lord, what was that?
- Your brother.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.101
He has been here since
6 o'clock this morning

11:43.103 --> 11:46.471
and right now,
he is taking out our trash.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.839
Why?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.974
You have to empty the cans
before you can wash them

11:49.976 --> 11:54.245
and paint them with our names
in a bold, contrasting color.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.215
Well, at least that way
when the Ochmoneks take them

11:57.217 --> 11:59.818
we'll have proof.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.254
Willie, I thought you were gonna
talk to your brother about..

12:03.256 --> 12:05.156
getting a life.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.558
What do you mean?
He has a life.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.094
Yes, our life.
And I'd like it back, thank you.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.463
[crash]

12:11.465 --> 12:13.131
Kate, he's never had to make

12:13.133 --> 12:14.833
such a difficult
adjustment before.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.167
Well, neither have we.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.470
Don't sit.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.873
He stain-guarded
our furniture, Willie.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.176
We've been meaning
to get to that for months.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.846
Oh, good, you're both here.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.314
I had a thought.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.683
You know what would look great
in your backyard?

12:31.685 --> 12:34.419
A topiary garden.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.922
You.. You wanna make animals
out of our bushes?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.324
That's right.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.358
There's a seal
in your back hedge

12:40.360 --> 12:43.928
just flapping to get out.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.731
I don't know.

12:46.733 --> 12:50.201
I don't think
we're zoned for that.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.903
I'll check.

12:51.905 --> 12:52.937
Good.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.773
I'll start breakfast.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.310
Alright. Admit it, Willie.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.746
You have a blind spot when it
comes to your brother Neal.

13:01.748 --> 13:02.847
But what about ALF?

13:02.849 --> 13:04.315
This is not fair for him.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.850
It's harder on him than anybody.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.352
It wouldn't hurt for him to show

13:07.354 --> 13:09.654
a little compassion
about this, you know.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.889
Didn't you promise ALF

13:10.891 --> 13:14.192
that when Neal moved he wouldn't
have to hide anymore?

13:14.194 --> 13:16.861
And he won't. Someday.

13:16.863 --> 13:21.766
Now he's just being close-minded
and stubborn about it.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.168
Okay. That may be, Willie

13:23.170 --> 13:27.172
but when I ran into ALF
this morning, he hissed at me.

13:27.174 --> 13:30.275
- What?
- He hissed.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.876
And he meant it.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.582
- I'll talk to him.
- Okay.

13:39.719 --> 13:40.919
[sighs]

13:46.159 --> 13:48.059
ALF, we have to talk.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.161
[hisses]

13:50.163 --> 13:52.163
There'll be no more hissing.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.631
Well, make it fast.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.301
I've got a date with destiny.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.203
Where do you think
you're going?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.737
Who knows?

13:59.739 --> 14:02.941
I'm gonna stick out my thumb,
show a little leg

14:02.943 --> 14:04.909
and see where the road takes me.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.780
You know, you're really making
this whole thing

14:08.782 --> 14:11.282
into a lot more
than it really is.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.284
Oh, am I?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.819
Please forgive me.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.422
I've been so intolerant.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.157
ALF, can't you understand?

14:19.159 --> 14:21.159
Neal is family.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.928
I can't just turn him away.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.997
So, what am I, a pet?

14:25.999 --> 14:27.232
Is that it?

14:27.234 --> 14:28.733
Because I'll tell you
something, Willie.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.670
That's how I'm made to feel
around here sometimes.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.772
I'm sorry that's how you feel.

14:34.774 --> 14:38.343
Sometimes I think you'd rather
drive me out to the desert..

14:38.345 --> 14:42.847
toss me away and leave me
to the coyotes.

14:42.849 --> 14:46.684
ALF, you've gotta stop listening
at our door.

14:46.686 --> 14:50.688
- You're kidding, right?
- Yeah.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.390
Oh, ha, ha.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.262
Face it, Willie. You can't keep
treating me like this.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.731
After all, I'm a person.

14:59.733 --> 15:04.636
Well, technically I'm not, but
I still have feelings like one.

15:04.638 --> 15:08.673
I'm sorry, ALF,
of course you have feelings.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.476
But so does he.
So does my brother.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.646
So, what should I do?

15:14.648 --> 15:17.615
Well, I was hoping
to avoid this..

15:17.617 --> 15:21.986
but since it looks like it's
gonna be a permanent situation

15:21.988 --> 15:25.456
why don't I just introduce
the two of you?

15:25.458 --> 15:26.891
Get a clue.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.560
I don't like him.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.963
Well, you don't even know him.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.431
And I don't like him.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.667
Imagine if I met him.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.535
[sighs]
Come on, ALF.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.738
It'd make everything a whole lot
easier for everybody.

15:40.740 --> 15:45.076
And besides, I'm sure the two
of you would get along great.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.511
Pass.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.980
Oh, you're just being childish.

15:48.982 --> 15:52.483
Am not, am not, am not.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.885
Alright. Suit yourself.

15:53.887 --> 15:56.220
Stick out your thumb,
show some leg..

15:56.222 --> 15:58.589
because that's the best
I can offer.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.326
And frankly,
I've seen your legs

16:01.328 --> 16:04.996
and trust me,
you're not going anywhere.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.699
That's one man's opinion.

16:07.701 --> 16:11.903
Look, you can either meet him
or stay hidden up here.

16:11.905 --> 16:14.505
It's your choice.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.141
Alright, I'll meet him.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.509
Hand me that fan,

16:18.511 --> 16:22.080
I wanna scrape off my feet.

16:22.082 --> 16:27.251
Hey, just because I don't like
him doesn't mean I'm not vain.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.586
What?

16:32.926 --> 16:36.427
Maybe meeting Neal
isn't such a good idea.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.996
It's gonna be fine.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.198
ALF, you two
are gonna get along great.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.835
He's a wonderful guy
with a terrific sense of humor.

16:43.837 --> 16:48.072
I'm not gonna marry him, if
that's what you're getting at.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.574
Now, when Neal gets here,

16:49.576 --> 16:51.609
I don't think you should
be in the room.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.211
Uh, not right away, anyway.

16:53.213 --> 16:56.948
I'm gonna need time
to prepare him for the shock..

16:56.950 --> 16:59.317
Surprise..

16:59.319 --> 17:02.587
Pleasure of your company.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.822
Why don't I just leap
out of a closet at him?

17:04.824 --> 17:08.926
If he dies, you won't
have to explain a thing.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.194
[doorbell dings]

17:10.196 --> 17:11.462
He's here.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.197
Oh, my gosh.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.832
I can't go through with this.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.935
My heart's racing
like a schoolboy.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.137
Will you relax?

17:19.139 --> 17:20.538
You're just meeting my brother.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.673
It's not the pope.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.308
I'd rather meet the pope.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.644
I love his hats.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.013
ALF, go into the kitchen
and we'll call you

17:29.015 --> 17:30.948
when it's time
to come out, okay?

17:30.950 --> 17:32.917
Alright, alright.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.987
It'll give me some time
to spread butter on my feet.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.260
- Neal. Hi.
- Hi, Kate.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.361
Hi, everyone.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.395
- Neal.
- Hey, Uncle Neal.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.663
How's the new apartment?

17:45.665 --> 17:47.365
Did you get the electricity
turned on okay?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:49.002 --> 17:51.669
Looks pretty drab
now that I can see everything.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.105
But hey, it's home.

17:54.107 --> 17:57.975
Hi, Uncle Neal. Hope
you haven't had too much coffee.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.444
No. Why?

17:59.446 --> 18:01.179
Oh, you know my brother.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.949
Always concerned
for people's welfare.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.451
[laughing]

18:06.453 --> 18:10.288
So, what did you guys
wanna talk to me about?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.956
Sit down, Neal.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.995
There's really no easy way
to say this.

18:17.997 --> 18:21.432
Um, there's something
about our household

18:21.434 --> 18:22.467
that you don't know.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.868
Something pretty unique.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.136
Something we've kept a secret.

18:25.138 --> 18:28.072
It's something
that you might find

18:28.074 --> 18:31.109
hard to accept at first.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.412
Is it something to do
with Brian?

18:34.414 --> 18:37.682
I wish it was that simple.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.016
What do you mean?

18:39.018 --> 18:40.651
What does she mean?

18:43.089 --> 18:46.591
Uh, I don't know how to say
this without sounding crazy

18:46.593 --> 18:48.559
so I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

18:48.561 --> 18:53.531
Neal, we have an alien
living with us.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.434
He's an alien from space.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.871
We have an alien
from space living with us.

18:59.873 --> 19:02.707
He's a part of our family now.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.543
That's why we thought
you two should meet.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.545
You guys.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.747
[laughing]

19:09.749 --> 19:12.216
I know this is hard
to accept, Neal

19:12.218 --> 19:13.718
but the fact is..

19:13.720 --> 19:17.688
we've had an alien from space
living with us forever.

19:17.690 --> 19:22.593
I mean, for almost
three years now.

19:22.595 --> 19:26.631
Oh, I see. Let me guess.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.232
He always wants
to phone home, right?

19:28.234 --> 19:29.834
[chuckles]

19:29.836 --> 19:33.271
You laugh, but we did have
to lock out the 9-7-6 numbers.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.240
Remember, honey?

19:36.242 --> 19:38.009
Well..

19:38.011 --> 19:40.244
I guess the best thing would be
to just have you meet him.

19:40.246 --> 19:41.913
Yeah.

19:41.915 --> 19:46.951
You guys are gonna carry this
right to the end, aren't you?

19:46.953 --> 19:49.720
ALF, you can come in here now.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.397
ALF.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.567
It's so good to meet you.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.469
So sorry I doubted you.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.605
Oh, where is he?

20:07.607 --> 20:09.240
He must be hiding.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.541
He didn't wanna meet you.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.476
Well, he's probably shy.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.379
No, he just doesn't like you.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.716
Brian, can you go try
to find him, please?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.117
We're not kidding, Neal.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.385
This is real.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.420
[scoffs]

20:22.422 --> 20:23.788
Come on.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.790
Do you all really believe this?

20:25.792 --> 20:28.292
I mean, is this something
you've actually seen?

20:28.294 --> 20:29.493
[Kate chuckles]

20:29.495 --> 20:33.097
In haunting clarity.

20:33.099 --> 20:36.567
Sorry.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.336
You must be Neal.

20:38.338 --> 20:42.039
I'm Gordon Shumway.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.942
Did I kill him?

20:44.944 --> 20:47.712
Oh, my God, you're for real.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.281
Yeah, yeah, let's get past this.

20:50.283 --> 20:54.018
I'm an alien and you're not.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.353
Wow.

20:55.355 --> 20:58.356
This is gonna take
some time to sink in.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.991
Well, while you're in a daze..

20:59.993 --> 21:05.029
let me show you where your
brother keeps his band saw.

21:05.031 --> 21:09.033
I'm being insulted
by an alien from space.

21:09.035 --> 21:12.236
Get used to it.

21:12.238 --> 21:15.640
Uh, can I touch you?

21:15.642 --> 21:19.343
Not without dinner and a show.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.979
I have a million questions
I wanna ask you.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.949
I'm sure. Keep them
to yourself, huh?

21:24.951 --> 21:26.851
Now, enough of this small talk.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.854
Let's get down to business.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.657
I understand
you're quite the cook.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.894
Do you eat like earthlings?

21:36.896 --> 21:39.163
Do I eat like earthlings?

21:39.165 --> 21:41.432
Willie, tell him.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.167
He eats.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.903
He doesn't chew.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.372
I don't know what to say.

21:48.374 --> 21:52.643
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.744
Kate's right.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.213
Get a life.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.548
ALF.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.884
Well, he may as well know.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.253
I mean, we're all family now.

22:16.969 --> 22:20.671
So in other words,
what you're saying is..

22:20.673 --> 22:23.274
except for having eight stomachs

22:23.276 --> 22:26.744
you're really not special
in any way.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.546
Oh, gee, thanks.

22:28.548 --> 22:32.116
Hey, are you gonna play, or are
you gonna jabber on all night?

22:32.118 --> 22:33.684
Oh.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.454
Well, I thought you said
this pointy guy

22:36.456 --> 22:38.889
could only move diagonally.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.424
Did I say that?

22:40.426 --> 22:43.961
Well, what I meant was
it can only move diagonally..

22:43.963 --> 22:46.931
except when the move follows
the taking of an odd number

22:46.933 --> 22:49.333
of the opponent's men
from the board.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.269
Oh.

22:52.271 --> 22:55.039
You sure you've never played
this game before?

22:55.041 --> 22:57.608
No, this is my first time.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.777
Good. Let's play for money.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.449
Gin. You owe me 1500 bucks.

23:12.892 --> 23:16.093
