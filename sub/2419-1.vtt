04:25.219 --> 04:26.168
What's going on, Hop?

04:27.812 --> 04:30.146
You back again?

04:34.787 --> 04:35.714
Oh, sick!

04:36.707 --> 04:37.634
Find good one?

04:38.563 --> 04:40.124
Yeah, <i>Ten Tigers of Kwangtung.</i>

04:40.579 --> 04:41.528
This is gold.

04:44.291 --> 04:45.535
<i>Bride With White Hair.</i>

04:46.275 --> 04:47.617
Chinese, no subtitles.

04:47.683 --> 04:49.822
Hey, Hop, do you have
any early Shaw Brothers?

04:49.892 --> 04:51.102
There's a guy
who does Leopard style...

04:51.171 --> 04:53.342
Leopard style, Dragon style...

04:54.340 --> 04:57.187
fly through air, fight on water.

04:58.115 --> 05:01.149
Crouching Tiger,
Spanking Monkey.

05:02.020 --> 05:02.947
I know you.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.378
Another white boy
who wants to know kung-fu.

05:06.147 --> 05:07.260
Kick the ass.

05:08.323 --> 05:09.436
Get the girls.

05:53.379 --> 05:55.135
Only storage back here.

05:56.836 --> 05:57.883
Where did you get this?

05:58.563 --> 05:59.490
It was here...

06:00.899 --> 06:02.906
when my grandfather
opened this shop...

06:03.715 --> 06:04.795
hundred years ago.

06:06.915 --> 06:09.501
He waited for a man
to come to pick it up...

06:11.299 --> 06:12.924
return to rightful owner.

06:15.203 --> 06:16.348
Man never came.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.486
My father take over the shop.

06:20.067 --> 06:22.653
Waited, too. Long time.

06:22.723 --> 06:23.671
Now me.

06:24.547 --> 06:26.434
That's a Northern Temple-style
bo staff.

06:27.331 --> 06:29.819
Same kind the thirteen monks used
to save the Tang Emperor.

06:29.891 --> 06:31.135
I've seen it before.

06:32.387 --> 06:33.467
That exact one.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.394
I've had dreams about it.

06:35.459 --> 06:36.407
You know why?

06:37.187 --> 06:39.075
You watch
too much <i>Hong Kong Phooey.</i>

06:39.139 --> 06:40.066
Come.

06:40.419 --> 06:41.368
Come on.

06:42.691 --> 06:45.538
I give you
five awesome Bruce Lee movie...

06:46.915 --> 06:48.475
for very sick price.

06:48.547 --> 06:50.074
You're the man, Hop.

07:02.724 --> 07:03.672
Jason!

07:04.803 --> 07:06.777
Hey. What's up?

07:06.851 --> 07:08.990
Not much.
Just, you know, cruisin'.

07:09.059 --> 07:10.139
You been down to Chinatown.

07:10.211 --> 07:11.291
What's up with that?

07:12.739 --> 07:13.666
Kung-fu.

07:13.731 --> 07:14.659
Are you serious?

07:14.723 --> 07:16.097
I'm not supposed
to talk about it...

07:16.163 --> 07:17.440
not under the kung-fu code.

07:17.507 --> 07:20.856
Hey, look. The new kid's
makin' time with the hoodsies.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.775
J-boy, you still riding
this loser cruiser?

07:23.843 --> 07:25.469
You need to get a motor
for this shit.

07:26.563 --> 07:27.774
What we got here?

07:27.843 --> 07:29.697
Just some bootlegs, no big deal.

07:29.763 --> 07:30.875
<i>"Enter the Dragon"?</i>

07:32.387 --> 07:33.369
<i>"The Bride With White Hair"?</i>

07:33.443 --> 07:35.232
Yeah, that's actually very good.

07:37.763 --> 07:39.072
Come on, let him go.

07:39.139 --> 07:40.863
Yeah, don't. He knows kung-fu.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.108
What?

07:42.179 --> 07:43.292
You think you're Chinese?

07:43.363 --> 07:45.021
You hangin' out
with them Chinks in C-town?

07:46.211 --> 07:47.673
What's up with you?
Let's see some, man.

07:47.747 --> 07:48.674
Come on.

07:49.283 --> 07:50.657
Let's see some kung-fu, huh?

07:50.723 --> 07:51.672
Kung-fu master.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.071
Want some tae kwon do, huh?

08:00.195 --> 08:01.242
Yo, Lupo.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.225
He's hangin' out with that
old Chink cashes checks.

08:07.747 --> 08:09.373
You in tight with the old man?

08:13.763 --> 08:14.876
Just shut up and do it!

08:19.651 --> 08:21.309
It's late, man.
He's probably gone home.

08:28.483 --> 08:29.890
He's not here. Let's just go.

08:29.955 --> 08:31.133
Who's there?

08:32.547 --> 08:33.626
Kung-fu boy.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.419
You back
for more good-price movie?

08:43.938 --> 08:46.721
I told you,
best deal in Chinatown.

08:46.787 --> 08:47.932
Come in.

08:49.827 --> 08:50.972
Want some tea?

08:52.163 --> 08:53.472
Red Sox game is on.

08:55.459 --> 08:57.281
Yankees winning. Very bad.

09:01.763 --> 09:03.192
Who's with you?

09:03.267 --> 09:04.249
Friend?

09:04.323 --> 09:05.730
Where you keep the cash?

09:11.843 --> 09:13.337
I said,
where do you keep the cash?

09:13.411 --> 09:14.818
- Please...
- Come on, old man!

09:16.419 --> 09:17.467
Stay here!

09:35.779 --> 09:36.924
Found your Xbox.

09:43.075 --> 09:44.023
Hop!

09:45.059 --> 09:45.987
Jesus, Lupo!

09:46.051 --> 09:47.393
- What the hell, man?
- You shot him!

09:47.459 --> 09:48.407
Take it.

09:49.603 --> 09:51.742
Must return to rightful owner.

09:52.419 --> 09:53.401
Run.

09:55.426 --> 09:56.375
You didn't see that, yo.

09:57.571 --> 09:58.651
You didn't see that!

10:09.315 --> 10:10.722
Come here, you little shit!

10:20.483 --> 10:22.044
Lupo, come on, man! Just don't...

10:22.115 --> 10:23.544
- You didn't see nothing!
- Calm down, Lupo.

10:23.619 --> 10:24.634
Hey, chill, man. Come on.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.951
- Put the gun down.
- Shut up!

10:26.019 --> 10:28.702
Maybe I pulled the trigger,
but we're all in this together!

10:29.282 --> 10:31.322
But this little cockroach,
he ain't one of us!

11:43.587 --> 11:44.535
Excuse me.

11:44.611 --> 11:45.789
I don't know where I am.

11:46.434 --> 11:47.841
I don't know how I got here.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.335
I remember falling.

13:10.562 --> 13:11.806
What? This?

13:12.515 --> 13:13.463
You want this?

13:58.659 --> 13:59.869
I don't know what you're saying.

14:02.979 --> 14:05.280
I can't understand you!

14:08.514 --> 14:10.336
That's because
you're not listening!

14:12.803 --> 14:13.752
Behind you!

14:46.435 --> 14:47.515
I don't know where I am...

14:48.675 --> 14:49.602
or how I got here...

14:49.667 --> 14:51.128
and who those guys were
that wanted to kill me.

14:51.907 --> 14:53.794
But whatever you did back there
was sick.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.193
No. Drunken Fist.

14:57.347 --> 14:59.070
Secret kung-fu of the South.

15:00.002 --> 15:02.523
I'm Lu Yan, traveling scholar.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.694
What land do you come from, monk?

15:05.762 --> 15:06.940
I'm not a monk.

15:07.971 --> 15:09.149
I'm Jason.

15:09.219 --> 15:11.422
Jason Tripitikas,
from South Boston.

15:13.602 --> 15:14.747
Is this a dream?

15:14.818 --> 15:16.379
No.

15:16.451 --> 15:18.655
Where you came from
is the dream...

15:19.266 --> 15:21.121
through the Gate of No Gate.

15:22.146 --> 15:24.699
Is that like a wormhole
or something?

15:24.770 --> 15:27.105
No. It means
you are either a Zen master...

15:28.354 --> 15:30.296
or you carry something
very special.

15:30.786 --> 15:32.096
This?

15:32.163 --> 15:34.301
It was in a pawn shop, waiting
for a man to pick it up...

15:34.370 --> 15:37.687
and return it
to its rightful owner.

15:38.818 --> 15:39.931
What?

15:40.994 --> 15:42.304
It's long been foretold...

15:43.395 --> 15:44.704
that a seeker will come...

15:45.571 --> 15:49.979
to return the staff and end
the reign of the Jade Warlord.

15:50.659 --> 15:51.903
Return the staff to who?

15:52.962 --> 15:54.391
The Monkey King.

15:54.466 --> 15:56.157
Born of a stone...

15:56.706 --> 15:59.041
on the mountain of fruit
and flowers.

15:59.938 --> 16:04.128
With his weapon in hand,
his chi became like fire...

16:04.771 --> 16:06.658
his stick fighting like magic.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.088
He defied the order
of the land...

16:10.051 --> 16:12.571
but the Jade Army
could not defeat him.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.125
The Monkey King crushed
every soldier sent to stop him.

16:36.195 --> 16:39.064
With his magical staff,
he was unbeatable.

16:40.194 --> 16:41.787
Word of his disobedience...

16:41.859 --> 16:44.609
traveled deep
within the Forbidden Kingdom...

16:44.675 --> 16:48.090
to the Five Elements Mountain,
land of the immortals.

16:48.867 --> 16:51.136
Once every 500 years...

16:51.203 --> 16:53.756
the Jade Emperor hosts
the Peach Banquet.

16:53.827 --> 16:56.445
It is here,
the heavenly ministers gather...

16:56.514 --> 16:58.554
to celebrate their longevity...

16:58.627 --> 17:00.896
and drink
the elixir of immortality.

17:02.659 --> 17:06.935
One sip of this heavenly brew
will give everlasting life...

17:07.011 --> 17:09.564
free from mortal suffering
and desire.

17:13.698 --> 17:16.895
Into the banquet, the
Monkey King crashed, uninvited.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.545
The Jade Emperor was
enchanted by the Monkey King.

17:25.473 --> 17:27.809
But the Jade Warlord
was not amused.

17:28.643 --> 17:30.203
As master of the army...

17:30.274 --> 17:33.308
the Warlord demanded
the Monkey King bow down to him.

17:42.498 --> 17:45.116
He's a bit unrefined,
that's all.

17:46.498 --> 17:50.110
Give the naughty monkey
a title and let him go.

17:54.243 --> 17:57.177
Satisfied all was well
in heaven and earth...

17:57.250 --> 17:58.712
the supremely high Emperor...

17:58.786 --> 18:01.503
left to begin
his 500 years meditation...

18:01.571 --> 18:05.215
leaving the Jade Warlord
in charge by mandate of heaven.

18:06.146 --> 18:08.186
But rather than obey
the Jade Emperor's command...

18:08.259 --> 18:11.106
the Warlord challenged
the Monkey King to a duel.

18:12.610 --> 18:16.385
High atop Five Elements Mountain
in the Warlord's palace...

18:16.770 --> 18:19.226
the battle of immortals
was fought...

18:19.298 --> 18:22.647
to prove once and for all
whose skills were supreme.

20:55.106 --> 20:58.335
Most excellent stick fighting,
Sun Wukong.

20:58.402 --> 21:01.599
But without your weapon, you're
nothing but a lowly hermit!

21:02.882 --> 21:05.402
No more weapons,
no more chi magic.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.022
Fist against fist.

21:10.434 --> 21:12.289
The Monkey King
was too trusting...

21:12.354 --> 21:14.209
and believed
the Warlord's words...

21:14.274 --> 21:15.835
laying down his magic weapon.

21:23.298 --> 21:26.080
Realizing he'd been tricked, the
Monkey King cast the staff...

21:26.146 --> 21:27.521
out into the Middle Kingdom.

21:45.154 --> 21:47.773
Martial art
is based on deception...

21:49.059 --> 21:50.073
my friend.

21:56.227 --> 21:59.096
Being immortal, the Monkey King
could not be killed...

21:59.170 --> 22:00.763
only trapped in stone...

22:00.834 --> 22:03.005
where he waits for the seeker
from the prophesy...

22:03.074 --> 22:06.457
to return to him his great weapon
and finally free him.

22:17.347 --> 22:18.688
That's what I heard, anyway.

22:20.962 --> 22:22.042
Long time ago.

22:22.370 --> 22:23.482
How long has he been imprisoned?

22:24.450 --> 22:27.352
Five hundred years,
give or take a few decades.

22:28.226 --> 22:30.647
They say
when the Monkey King is free...

22:30.722 --> 22:32.031
the Jade Emperor will return.

22:34.146 --> 22:35.291
How do I get home?

22:35.362 --> 22:38.777
You must return the staff
to Five Elements Mountain.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.368
You must free the Monkey King.

22:41.442 --> 22:42.686
I can't free the Monkey King.

22:42.754 --> 22:43.682
I gotta get home.

22:43.746 --> 22:45.688
Innkeeper! More wine.

22:46.146 --> 22:47.870
Jeez, don't you think
you've had one too many?

22:49.283 --> 22:50.744
Wine is my inspiration.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.013
In some parts,
I am known as the Poet.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.031
<i>Gambei.</i>

22:58.786 --> 23:00.924
In other parts,
I am known as the Beggar.

23:23.714 --> 23:24.641
What do we do now?

23:24.706 --> 23:25.916
How good is your kung-fu?

23:28.034 --> 23:29.561
He who speaks does not know.

23:29.634 --> 23:31.674
He who knows does not speak.

23:31.746 --> 23:33.240
Surely, you are masterful.

23:40.002 --> 23:40.951
Where did you get that weapon?

23:41.026 --> 23:41.953
It's a fake.

23:42.018 --> 23:44.800
You can find anything these days
on the Silk Road.

23:44.866 --> 23:46.076
Out of way, old fool.

23:49.698 --> 23:50.647
Hand it over.

23:53.090 --> 23:55.938
Hand over the weapon... or die.

24:08.162 --> 24:09.110
Go!

24:41.250 --> 24:42.298
Lu, help!

25:01.346 --> 25:02.295
Protect yourself!

25:02.370 --> 25:03.319
What?

26:14.306 --> 26:15.255
Let's go!

26:31.202 --> 26:32.281
Where are you going?

26:34.594 --> 26:35.870
- Jump!
- I don't think so!

26:35.938 --> 26:37.313
Don't think! Just do!

26:47.682 --> 26:48.630
Come on!

26:58.498 --> 26:59.512
Thank you!

27:07.970 --> 27:08.898
Such skills, child!

27:08.962 --> 27:10.784
Are you
from northern mountains?

27:10.850 --> 27:12.705
She is Golden Sparrow,
from the south.

28:06.338 --> 28:07.745
You really saved
our lives back there.

28:08.513 --> 28:09.441
I don't know
what we would have done...

28:09.506 --> 28:10.455
if you hadn't come along.

28:10.530 --> 28:13.792
She does not think The Drunken
Immortal needed his life saved.

28:15.106 --> 28:16.054
You're immortal?

28:17.250 --> 28:18.974
What do you run from, child?

28:19.202 --> 28:21.274
Bounty hunters
trying to stop her...

28:21.345 --> 28:23.734
from reaching
the Five Elements Mountain.

28:29.794 --> 28:31.801
I suggest
you keep riding west...

28:31.874 --> 28:33.914
and only stop
to water your horses.

28:33.986 --> 28:35.033
You're not coming?

28:35.106 --> 28:36.960
The journey
to Five Elements Mountain...

28:37.026 --> 28:38.619
crosses barrens and deserts.

28:38.690 --> 28:39.835
Unspeakable dangers.

28:39.906 --> 28:41.596
Worst of all, no wine.

28:41.665 --> 28:42.909
His elixir.

28:42.977 --> 28:44.352
Every immortal has one.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.687
I'm very sorry.
Without wine, I would perish.

28:46.754 --> 28:47.703
You must understand this.

28:48.481 --> 28:51.165
No. You must understand this.

28:51.234 --> 28:52.216
This is insane!

28:53.570 --> 28:55.130
- You wish to get home?
- Yes.

28:57.602 --> 28:58.682
Then listen well!

28:58.754 --> 28:59.681
If you die here...

28:59.745 --> 29:01.818
you'll be found dead
in the world you left behind.

29:02.370 --> 29:03.352
Do you understand?

29:06.178 --> 29:08.065
My jug is getting low.

29:08.130 --> 29:09.407
I must say goodbye. Bye-bye.

29:18.434 --> 29:19.416
Lu.

29:19.874 --> 29:20.822
Wait!

29:21.377 --> 29:22.359
Let him go.

29:22.433 --> 29:25.335
You are the one
to return the staff, not him.

29:26.529 --> 29:28.188
How good is your kung-fu?

29:28.258 --> 29:29.883
He's got no kung-fu.

29:29.954 --> 29:31.198
None!

29:31.266 --> 29:32.411
Lu, wait!

29:32.930 --> 29:34.075
Teach me.

29:34.817 --> 29:36.246
Teach me to fight!

29:45.729 --> 29:47.256
Swing soft, cut hard!

29:47.330 --> 29:48.475
At the same time!

29:50.146 --> 29:51.160
He's terrible.

29:55.810 --> 29:57.665
I've been your weed-whacker
for two days now...

29:58.242 --> 30:00.730
while you sit on your horse
like the King of England.

30:00.802 --> 30:02.111
When are you gonna
teach me kung-fu?

30:02.178 --> 30:04.633
- You want to learn kung-fu?
- Yeah.

30:08.769 --> 30:10.176
I teach you kung-fu.

30:13.538 --> 30:14.465
That's called strike.

30:14.529 --> 30:15.740
Tomorrow, I'll teach you block.

30:16.290 --> 30:17.305
Let's go.

30:18.498 --> 30:20.832
Swing soft, cut hard.

30:40.994 --> 30:42.903
You think you'll teach me
the No Shadow Kick?

30:44.866 --> 30:46.688
And the Buddha Palm Technique?

30:49.345 --> 30:50.687
There's a guy
in <i>Virtual Fighter 2...</i>

30:51.458 --> 30:52.832
that does
the Buddha Palm technique.

30:52.898 --> 30:54.207
Thanks, Lu.

30:54.274 --> 30:55.518
And he does the...

30:56.962 --> 30:57.911
the Iron Elbow...

30:58.914 --> 31:01.052
and he does
the One-Fingered Death Touch.

31:01.121 --> 31:02.136
The cup's full.

31:02.210 --> 31:03.322
Stop! It's full.

31:04.738 --> 31:05.785
Exactly.

31:06.562 --> 31:08.504
How can you fill your cup
if already full?

31:09.409 --> 31:11.068
How can you learn kung-fu?

31:11.138 --> 31:12.698
You already know so much.

31:13.441 --> 31:15.165
No Shadow Kick, Buddha Palm!

31:16.194 --> 31:17.404
Empty your cup.

31:22.849 --> 31:24.256
Hopeless.

31:24.322 --> 31:25.401
It is hopeless.

31:46.145 --> 31:47.640
It is said that music...

31:48.930 --> 31:52.410
is a bridge
between earth and heaven.

31:53.634 --> 31:54.714
It's beautiful.

32:01.505 --> 32:02.912
It belonged to her mother.

34:01.986 --> 34:03.000
Lu Yan?

34:19.810 --> 34:20.889
Sparrow!

35:04.609 --> 35:05.624
Are you all right?

35:05.698 --> 35:06.625
Jason, what happened?

35:06.689 --> 35:08.697
He took it! The staff!

35:10.977 --> 35:13.050
The Jade Warlord
has sent a bounty hunter.

35:13.857 --> 35:15.134
We are doomed.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.737
That's his horse.

35:27.809 --> 35:28.758
He must be inside.

35:29.858 --> 35:32.313
Why would he take refuge
in a temple?

35:32.385 --> 35:33.595
That's what I intend
to find out.

35:34.305 --> 35:35.385
Wait with the horses.

36:05.793 --> 36:07.135
Good to get off my feet.

36:08.897 --> 36:09.846
Long day.

36:11.201 --> 36:13.143
So, where are you from?

36:13.217 --> 36:14.362
Shandong Province?

36:15.938 --> 36:18.491
You look like
the Shandong Province type.

36:18.562 --> 36:19.739
You come here often?

36:22.146 --> 36:24.055
That staff
doesn't belong to you.

36:27.458 --> 36:29.978
You have to give it to me,
or somebody might get hurt.

37:47.234 --> 37:48.695
What kind of monk are you?

37:49.921 --> 37:51.546
Stealing from travelers.

37:54.818 --> 37:56.378
A silent one, I see.

37:58.017 --> 37:58.966
Or deaf.

38:01.185 --> 38:02.646
I'm speaking to you, monk!

39:38.209 --> 39:39.485
Praying Mantis.

39:39.554 --> 39:40.764
Very good...

39:40.833 --> 39:42.294
for catching bugs.

39:42.369 --> 39:43.547
But not tiger!

41:35.969 --> 41:38.239
You tried to steal the staff
for the Warlord!

41:38.305 --> 41:39.352
No, fool!

41:41.857 --> 41:44.475
I'm on a mission to find
the seeker of the staff.

42:02.945 --> 42:04.222
You found him.

43:18.017 --> 43:19.544
How long have you been searching
for the staff?

43:20.353 --> 43:21.979
As long as I can remember.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.622
Jason, go deeper!

44:34.049 --> 44:36.350
Must taste bitter before sweet.

44:36.417 --> 44:37.943
Horse stance. Grow roots.

44:50.144 --> 44:51.093
Horse stance.

44:52.641 --> 44:55.423
Very good... for taking a dump.

44:58.593 --> 44:59.738
Enough from you!

44:59.809 --> 45:01.980
He's my student, not yours!

45:02.049 --> 45:05.082
Two tigers cannot live
on the same mountain.

45:05.152 --> 45:07.454
Two masters cannot teach
the same student!

45:12.480 --> 45:15.230
If he is really to learn
the kung-fu...

45:15.297 --> 45:18.199
he must develop speed,
accuracy, and power.

45:18.561 --> 45:20.416
Hey! I know that.

45:20.961 --> 45:22.619
It's the Way
of the Intercepting Fist.

45:22.688 --> 45:23.637
Bruce Lee?

45:30.817 --> 45:32.094
I will punch.

45:32.161 --> 45:33.371
You block.

45:33.441 --> 45:34.390
Ready?

45:37.921 --> 45:39.644
What did I teach you
about the Snake?

45:40.801 --> 45:42.045
Now you punch me.

45:44.801 --> 45:45.750
See?

45:48.321 --> 45:49.630
Again. You punch him again.

45:49.697 --> 45:50.645
Snake!

45:53.857 --> 45:55.286
He's not ready for Snake.

45:55.361 --> 45:56.605
Perhaps Eagle.

45:57.121 --> 45:58.681
Crane! Crane!

46:10.784 --> 46:12.475
Stop!

46:12.545 --> 46:13.822
I've had enough!

46:13.953 --> 46:15.262
No more!

46:15.329 --> 46:16.922
No more silent riddles!

46:17.985 --> 46:19.261
And no more empty cups!

46:24.032 --> 46:26.269
First, you show respect
to your teachers!

46:29.089 --> 46:32.252
So, what about the two tigers
on one mountain?

46:33.761 --> 46:35.550
We can kill each other
when it's over.

46:46.017 --> 46:47.326
Kung-fu.

46:47.393 --> 46:49.946
Hard work over time
to accomplish skill.

46:54.944 --> 46:57.279
A painter can hace kung-fu.

46:57.345 --> 47:01.469
Or the butcher who cuts meat
every day with such skill...

47:01.537 --> 47:03.773
his knife never touches bone.

47:08.161 --> 47:11.128
Learn the form,
but seek the formless.

47:12.128 --> 47:13.503
Hear the soundless.

47:14.113 --> 47:17.757
Learn it all,
then forget it all.

47:17.825 --> 47:21.818
Learn The Way,
then find your own way.

47:22.721 --> 47:24.892
The musician can hace kung-fu...

47:24.960 --> 47:27.808
or the poet who paints pictures
with words...

47:27.873 --> 47:29.815
and makes emperors weep.

47:29.889 --> 47:31.612
This, too, is kung-fu.

47:32.481 --> 47:36.671
But do not name it, my friend,
for it is like water.

47:36.736 --> 47:38.973
Nothing is softer than water...

47:39.041 --> 47:41.724
yet it can overcome rock.

47:41.792 --> 47:43.451
It does not fight.

47:43.521 --> 47:46.335
It flows around the opponent.

47:46.401 --> 47:48.189
Formless, nameless...

47:48.256 --> 47:51.518
the true master dwells within.

47:51.584 --> 47:53.591
Only you can free him.

48:54.656 --> 48:56.958
Behold the tyranny
of the Warlord.

48:57.984 --> 48:59.478
He must be stopped.

49:00.097 --> 49:03.413
He must be killed for his crimes
and his head put on a post.

49:04.704 --> 49:08.185
But we must not feel hatred
towards him, or he wins.

49:10.720 --> 49:12.892
If he speaks of compassion
for this devil...

49:13.889 --> 49:15.864
he should go back to his temple
and pray.

49:16.736 --> 49:19.933
Our mission is not one of peace.

49:20.001 --> 49:21.910
Go back
to your mother and father.

49:22.944 --> 49:24.253
You are but a child.

49:25.216 --> 49:26.165
They are dead.

49:28.417 --> 49:30.140
And she's not a child.

49:32.448 --> 49:33.659
Not anymore.

49:36.128 --> 49:37.077
Her father...

49:37.985 --> 49:41.597
was a government official
who opposed the Warlord.

49:43.360 --> 49:46.142
And so, to set an example...

49:46.209 --> 49:49.143
the Warlord dispatched
his troops into the night.

49:54.112 --> 49:58.236
Legion upon legion poured out
of the Five Elements Mountain...

49:58.304 --> 50:00.606
into the lowlands
of the Middle Kingdom.

50:02.625 --> 50:05.941
Screams of innocent people
hung in the night air.

50:09.184 --> 50:13.341
When it was over, charred ruins
were all that remained.

50:14.496 --> 50:18.326
That, and a lonely child, hidden
in the well by her mother...

50:19.648 --> 50:21.404
ruthlessly murdered
by an arrow...

50:24.128 --> 50:26.016
from the Warlord's bow.

50:31.264 --> 50:34.264
When she reaches
the Warlord's palace...

50:35.712 --> 50:38.331
she will
not offer him forgiveness...

50:39.361 --> 50:40.440
monk.

50:41.345 --> 50:42.589
She will offer him...

50:43.392 --> 50:44.440
this...

50:50.464 --> 50:52.090
a jade dart...

50:52.161 --> 50:54.266
that can kill an immortal.

50:55.616 --> 50:57.721
Long has she practiced.

51:02.753 --> 51:05.851
Vengeance has a way
of rebounding upon oneself.

51:11.713 --> 51:13.207
Master of sensitivity.

51:54.944 --> 51:56.286
Damn.

51:56.352 --> 51:57.432
This desert is hot.

51:59.392 --> 52:00.734
This is not a desert.

52:01.729 --> 52:03.638
That is the desert!

52:08.512 --> 52:10.072
I hope you know
where you're going!

52:10.560 --> 52:11.575
Crazy monk.

53:26.113 --> 53:27.323
A monk on a mission.

53:28.192 --> 53:29.599
And where does he lead us?

53:29.664 --> 53:31.639
Across a desert to nowhere.

53:56.864 --> 53:58.293
We're not going to make it,
are we?

54:02.560 --> 54:04.699
And even if we do, we still
have to face the Jade Army.

54:08.192 --> 54:09.534
What if I can't handle it?

54:15.872 --> 54:16.887
What if I freeze?

54:22.145 --> 54:23.639
Don't forget to breathe.

54:56.160 --> 54:59.837
If we don't find water soon,
we will perish.

55:01.920 --> 55:05.532
Perhaps a Taoist immortal
can make rain.

55:07.680 --> 55:10.942
If he truly is
a Taoist immortal.

56:33.376 --> 56:35.547
You are an insult
to the name of Buddha!

56:35.616 --> 56:36.598
Blasphemy!

56:40.096 --> 56:41.044
Look!

56:42.592 --> 56:44.153
I lead you to the mountain!

56:46.304 --> 56:47.449
Out there!

57:54.240 --> 57:55.189
Can you see them...

57:56.288 --> 57:57.270
in the clouds?

57:58.368 --> 57:59.644
A two-headed lion.

58:01.056 --> 58:02.038
Right there.

58:02.624 --> 58:03.551
See?

58:05.024 --> 58:05.972
Yeah, I see.

58:08.032 --> 58:08.959
See that one?

58:09.024 --> 58:10.234
Right there,
coming up behind it?

58:11.296 --> 58:12.244
Like a wave?

58:13.920 --> 58:15.164
Looks like the Green Monster.

58:16.224 --> 58:17.435
Green monster?

58:18.048 --> 58:19.063
You mean dragon.

58:20.320 --> 58:21.727
No, I mean Fenway Park.

58:22.848 --> 58:24.703
They call the left field fence
the Green Monster.

58:26.112 --> 58:27.290
It's true.

58:30.336 --> 58:32.060
It does kind of look like
a dragon, though, doesn't it?

58:36.800 --> 58:40.477
Have you family
back in this land you come from?

58:42.752 --> 58:43.701
My mother.

58:44.800 --> 58:45.748
Father?

58:47.456 --> 58:48.471
Never knew him.

58:50.752 --> 58:52.312
Do you ever long for him?

58:54.464 --> 58:55.838
Wonder who he was?

58:59.200 --> 59:01.883
Maybe the only thing
I've ever been good at...

59:03.904 --> 59:05.016
pretending that I don't.

59:08.288 --> 59:09.498
She is sorry.

59:14.080 --> 59:16.055
How romantic.

59:18.080 --> 59:21.179
Men will tell you
what you want to hear, Sparrow.

59:21.248 --> 59:24.826
But in the end, they will
leave you with nothing.

59:28.704 --> 59:30.744
You survived the River of Sand.

59:30.816 --> 59:32.060
Impressive.

59:32.736 --> 59:33.751
And you, boy...

59:34.464 --> 59:35.990
so far from home.

59:36.064 --> 59:39.064
I can ensure your safe return.

59:39.136 --> 59:40.991
Just bring the weapon forward.

59:41.056 --> 59:42.333
I don't think so.

59:43.424 --> 59:44.668
Why do you want the staff?

59:46.336 --> 59:48.441
When I deliver
the lost weapon...

59:48.512 --> 59:52.221
the Jade Warlord shall grant me
the Elixir of Immortality.

59:54.208 --> 59:56.892
An orphan girl,
a lost traveler...

59:56.960 --> 59:59.993
an old drunk,
and a monk who has failed...

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:02.301
at the same task
for half his life.

01:00:04.063 --> 01:00:08.820
Misfits following a misfit
in hopes of rescuing... a misfit.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:30.806
Kill them.

01:02:25.439 --> 01:02:27.578
Lu! You okay?

01:02:27.648 --> 01:02:28.892
Just thirsty.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.698
It's okay. He's immortal, right?

01:02:53.344 --> 01:02:54.326
I mean, he is, right?

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.025
Wine. He needs his wine!

01:02:56.096 --> 01:02:57.470
There is nothing we can do.

01:02:57.536 --> 01:02:58.463
What are you saying?

01:02:58.528 --> 01:02:59.543
We have to do something!

01:03:31.839 --> 01:03:35.188
I'm afraid the wound
is too deep.

01:03:35.263 --> 01:03:37.205
He will not survive it.

01:03:38.303 --> 01:03:39.351
He needs wine.

01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:42.749
He's one of the Eight Immortals.

01:03:42.816 --> 01:03:44.342
Wine is his elixir. Please.

01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:48.347
We will send a walking monk.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.160
Don't you have a running monk?

01:04:12.992 --> 01:04:14.268
When I was your age...

01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:17.660
I was a scholar-warrior
in training.

01:04:19.392 --> 01:04:21.726
My arrow was good.
So, too, my kung-fu.

01:04:22.975 --> 01:04:27.929
So I was chosen to take
the civil examinations.

01:04:29.312 --> 01:04:31.035
To pass would place me...

01:04:32.544 --> 01:04:35.740
in the very short line
of scholar immortals.

01:04:39.072 --> 01:04:40.021
I failed.

01:04:42.367 --> 01:04:43.512
You're not an immortal?

01:04:46.592 --> 01:04:49.691
If one
does not attach himself...

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.385
to people and desires...

01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:56.158
never shall his heart be broken.

01:04:58.335 --> 01:04:59.284
But then...

01:05:01.184 --> 01:05:02.907
does he ever truly live?

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.993
I would rather die a mortal...

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:11.800
who has cared about someone...

01:05:13.791 --> 01:05:15.864
than a man free...

01:05:15.936 --> 01:05:17.365
from his own death.

01:05:19.455 --> 01:05:21.016
I don't want to lose you.

01:05:24.415 --> 01:05:26.008
Forget about me.

01:05:28.928 --> 01:05:31.961
There is only one
Elixir of Immortality.

01:05:32.031 --> 01:05:35.031
It is
the Emperor's mix of jade...

01:05:35.104 --> 01:05:37.144
cinnabar, and salts of mercury.

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:41.623
It is forever stored in
the realm of the Jade Palace...

01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:47.167
high in the Jade Firmament,
rarely touched by mortals.

01:05:47.232 --> 01:05:50.647
To reach it,
one must take the north road...

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.240
and cross the border
of heaven and earth...

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.083
only to face the Jade Army.

01:05:59.263 --> 01:06:00.245
I'm sorry.

01:06:01.312 --> 01:06:03.002
There is no other way.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.593
Yes, there is.

01:06:07.103 --> 01:06:09.013
In two nights,
there should be no moon.

01:06:09.631 --> 01:06:11.736
We can take the south side
of the fourth peak...

01:06:12.384 --> 01:06:13.944
under cover of darkness.

01:06:15.231 --> 01:06:16.409
- We have to go now.
- No!

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.422
But he's going to die!

01:06:20.128 --> 01:06:21.622
We go now, we all die.

01:06:26.207 --> 01:06:29.436
There is more at stake,
an entire kingdom.

01:06:33.152 --> 01:06:34.777
Your passage home.

01:06:37.504 --> 01:06:40.799
We will advance in two nights,
when the moon has ceased.

01:06:41.503 --> 01:06:42.583
So be it!

01:07:27.968 --> 01:07:29.015
When she met you...

01:07:30.015 --> 01:07:32.885
long ago in a tea house...

01:07:33.888 --> 01:07:35.830
you were a lost boy
and frightened.

01:07:39.296 --> 01:07:41.368
Not the kind
she would stand and fight with.

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:34.741
You've made
a most excellent judgment.

01:09:51.935 --> 01:09:53.823
The seeker from the prophecy.

01:09:54.943 --> 01:09:57.016
Not quite what I expected.

01:09:57.088 --> 01:10:00.383
A man is dying
back on Song Mountain.

01:10:01.183 --> 01:10:02.131
I need the Elixir.

01:10:03.487 --> 01:10:06.237
And why should I give it to you?

01:10:06.303 --> 01:10:07.830
Because I brought you the staff.

01:10:09.183 --> 01:10:12.217
The life of your friend
for the power to rule a kingdom?

01:10:13.311 --> 01:10:15.067
A most reasonable offer.

01:10:15.999 --> 01:10:18.749
This man, a good friend?

01:10:19.903 --> 01:10:21.365
And a good teacher.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.506
The man who honors his teacher
honors himself.

01:10:25.791 --> 01:10:30.395
However, there is a bit
of a problem with your request.

01:10:31.136 --> 01:10:32.281
You see...

01:10:32.863 --> 01:10:35.863
I've promised the Elixir
to someone else.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:38.396
But she
didn't bring you the staff.

01:10:38.464 --> 01:10:39.412
I did.

01:10:40.255 --> 01:10:41.815
The boy has a point.

01:10:44.863 --> 01:10:47.384
My Liege, you made a promise.

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:51.189
There is but one way
to resolve such matters.

01:10:52.127 --> 01:10:55.094
A martial challenge...
to the death.

01:10:57.791 --> 01:10:58.936
With pleasure.

01:11:15.263 --> 01:11:17.150
The Elixir of Immortality.

01:11:21.535 --> 01:11:24.535
The prize goes to the winner.

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:45.267
Enough!

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:02.651
The seeker from the prophecy.

01:14:03.456 --> 01:14:05.278
I find that quite amusing.

01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:10.014
Did you really think, even for
a minute, you stood a chance?

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:14.968
I didn't think so.

01:15:10.655 --> 01:15:12.543
She will kill you, witch!

01:15:12.607 --> 01:15:15.225
Not if I kill you first,
orphan bitch!

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:00.531
<i>Gambei!</i>

01:18:19.551 --> 01:18:20.663
Remember what I taught you!

01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:17.462
The statue!

01:19:21.982 --> 01:19:23.030
Use the staff!

01:21:02.782 --> 01:21:03.731
My turn!

01:22:43.647 --> 01:22:44.595
My Lord.

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:47.003
Who are you?

01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:49.885
The youngest daughter
of a family you murdered.

01:22:51.678 --> 01:22:53.533
Come drink with me.

01:23:12.894 --> 01:23:14.455
No!

01:23:18.175 --> 01:23:19.123
Sparrow!

01:23:21.534 --> 01:23:23.127
Come on.

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:25.173
Come on.
You're going to be okay.

01:24:53.022 --> 01:24:54.451
Jade Warlord?

01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:56.819
He's dead.

01:25:07.998 --> 01:25:09.787
I thank you.

01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:03.125
Is there anything you can do?

01:26:05.567 --> 01:26:08.698
Her destiny was written
by her own hand.

01:26:10.367 --> 01:26:11.828
I am sorry.

01:26:44.927 --> 01:26:45.974
Traveler...

01:26:47.103 --> 01:26:49.470
you have come far,
through the Gate of No Gate...

01:26:49.535 --> 01:26:52.950
to fulfill the prophecy
of the mortals.

01:26:53.022 --> 01:26:55.443
What do you desire, please?

01:26:57.215 --> 01:26:58.556
I just want to go home.

01:27:00.766 --> 01:27:01.976
Very well.

01:27:07.294 --> 01:27:09.367
It is said master and student...

01:27:10.462 --> 01:27:12.120
walk the path side-by-side.

01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:15.387
They share their destiny until
their paths go separate ways.

01:27:22.398 --> 01:27:23.478
I'll never forget you.

01:27:24.414 --> 01:27:27.131
I guess that's what being
immortal truly means.

01:27:32.606 --> 01:27:34.297
You freed me, traveler.

01:27:35.646 --> 01:27:38.068
Now go free yourself.

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:21.625
So what's it gonna be?

01:29:26.558 --> 01:29:27.540
You gonna shut up?

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:36.600
Listen, pissant!

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.296
I ain't gonna ask you again!

01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:52.499
Come on, maggot, get up!
Come on!

01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:55.058
You want some more?

01:29:57.374 --> 01:29:58.302
Come on.

01:30:35.006 --> 01:30:36.216
We don't have to do this.

01:31:10.174 --> 01:31:11.897
Take it easy, sir.

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:12.915
You're gonna be fine.

01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:15.030
Hop! Hop!

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:16.181
How's he doin'?

01:31:16.254 --> 01:31:17.683
It missed his heart.
He'll live.

01:31:19.998 --> 01:31:22.137
Of course I'll live.

01:31:22.206 --> 01:31:23.668
I'm immortal.

01:31:25.918 --> 01:31:28.885
Did you return the staff
to rightful owner?

01:31:30.302 --> 01:31:31.230
I did.

01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:33.979
You're the man.

01:32:12.062 --> 01:32:13.207
Is he gonna be all right?

01:32:16.574 --> 01:32:18.330
Looks like it.

01:32:18.398 --> 01:32:19.773
I saw what happened.

01:32:19.838 --> 01:32:21.082
I work across the street.

01:32:22.334 --> 01:32:23.611
You were very brave.

01:32:26.494 --> 01:32:27.443
See ya.

01:32:31.166 --> 01:32:32.278
Absolutely.

01:32:46.718 --> 01:32:48.692
And so the legend is told...

01:32:48.766 --> 01:32:51.483
that the Monkey King
began his journey west...

01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:52.892
in search of truth...

01:32:53.822 --> 01:32:56.211
while the traveler
returned to his world...

01:32:56.286 --> 01:33:00.181
to walk the path of the warrior
and find his own truth.

01:33:01.022 --> 01:33:02.298
As one tale ends...

01:33:03.486 --> 01:33:05.007
so another
begins.
