00:26.276 --> 00:29.612
Hoo-wee! Your very
first princess summit!

00:29.613 --> 00:31.857
You must be over the
moon, Twilight.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.151
Oh, I am excited.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.869
But to be honest I'm
a little nervous too.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.245
You're nervicited!

00:38.247 --> 00:40.411
It's like you want to jump
up and down and yell,

00:40.415 --> 00:42.204
"Yay me!"

00:42.209 --> 00:44.794
But you also want to curl
up in a teeny-tiny ball

00:44.795 --> 00:46.914
and hide at the same time!

00:50.133 --> 00:51.967
We've all been there!

00:51.969 --> 00:54.804
I'm there almost every day.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.174
You got no reason to fret, Twi.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.925
Everything's gonna be just...

00:58.934 --> 01:00.177
Twilight!

01:00.185 --> 01:01.849
Oh, sorry, darling.

01:01.853 --> 01:05.098
But I just realized you're
not wearing your crown.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.851
You haven't forgotten it
back in Ponyville, have you?

01:07.859 --> 01:08.817
It's in my bag.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.780
I just feel a little
self-conscious about wearing it.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.651
I haven't really gotten
accustomed to these yet either.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.907
You are a princess now,
Twilight. Embrace it.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.952
I'm telling you, if I
had a crown like that,

01:24.960 --> 01:26.248
I would never take it off.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.042
Why, I'd sleep in the thing!

01:41.852 --> 01:45.768
Her Highness, Princess
Twilight Sparkle.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.485
Twilight! I haven't seen
you since the coronation.

01:50.486 --> 01:52.774
We have so much to discuss.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.943
But it can wait until tomorrow.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.359
You all look tired
from your journey.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.281
Now, off to bed, all of you.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.886
What's wrong, Twilight?

02:17.888 --> 02:19.722
I don't know, Spike.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.716
I'm just worried, I guess.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.934
Princess Cadence was given the
Crystal Empire to rule over.

02:24.935 --> 02:26.895
What if now that I'm a princess

02:26.897 --> 02:29.232
Celestia expects me to
lead a kingdom of my own?

02:29.233 --> 02:31.817
That would be awesome!

02:31.818 --> 02:33.777
No it would not.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.237
Just because I have this
crown and these wings,

02:36.238 --> 02:38.733
it doesn't mean I'll
be a good leader.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.735
Aw, sure you will, Twilight.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.238
But come on, you should
get some shuteye.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.239
Big day tomorrow.

02:53.215 --> 02:57.131
Ugh! Can't tuck! Ugh!

02:58.470 --> 03:01.180
Just trying to get comfortable!

03:06.311 --> 03:07.269
Ugh!

Huh? What?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.389
Oh!

05:52.394 --> 05:54.638
My crown! She's got my crown!

05:56.815 --> 05:58.683
Stop! Please!

05:58.692 --> 06:00.856
- She's stolen my crown!
- What?

06:03.738 --> 06:04.776
Stop!

06:20.171 --> 06:21.835
What did you do with my crown?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.833
Sorry it had to be this way...

06:25.427 --> 06:26.385
...Princess.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.512
Who was that?

06:33.810 --> 06:36.975
Sunset Shimmer,
a former student of mine.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.316
She began her studies with
me not long before Twilight.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.310
But when she did not
get what she wanted

06:42.319 --> 06:43.562
as quickly as she liked,

06:43.570 --> 06:45.689
she turned cruel and dishonest.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.065
I tried to help her,

06:47.073 --> 06:50.068
but she eventually decided
to abandon her studies

06:50.076 --> 06:51.535
and pursue her own path,

06:51.536 --> 06:54.121
one that has sadly led her
to stealing the crown.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.037
She replaced Twilight's
with this one.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.626
I suppose Sunset Shimmer thought
she wouldn't notice right away

06:58.627 --> 07:01.587
that this was not yours.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.298
And by the time you did,
it would be too late

07:04.299 --> 07:06.668
to go after your crown
and Element of Harmony.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.466
But I don't understand.
Where did she go?

07:09.471 --> 07:11.180
Where did she take the crown?

07:11.181 --> 07:14.392
You'll soon know more about
this place than even I do.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.681
This is no ordinary mirror.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.354
It is a gateway to another world,

07:22.359 --> 07:25.900
a gateway that opens
once every 30 moons.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.444
It's sparkly!

07:28.448 --> 07:31.488
It has always been kept in the
throne room of Canterlot Castle,

07:31.493 --> 07:34.203
but when Princess Cadence
took over the Crystal Empire,

07:34.204 --> 07:35.947
we sent it here for
her to watch over.

07:35.956 --> 07:40.498
I had always hoped Sunset
Shimmer would use it to return,

07:40.502 --> 07:43.372
to come back to Equestria
seeking my guidance.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.500
Obviously this is not
what has happened.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.298
Twilight, you must use the mirror

07:49.469 --> 07:52.805
to go into this other world
and retrieve your crown.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.721
Without it, the other Elements
of Harmony have no power,

07:55.725 --> 07:57.389
and Equestria is left without

07:57.394 --> 07:59.763
one of its most important
means of defense.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.234
Your crown does not
belong in the place

08:05.235 --> 08:07.479
Sunset Shimmer now calls home.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.402
And in her position,
your Element of Harmony

08:10.407 --> 08:12.241
will no doubt be used to bring harm

08:12.242 --> 08:13.906
to the inhabitants
of this other realm.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.496
They will not have the power
to defend themselves.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.993
Do you understand the
importance of your task?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.336
Of course.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.462
Good. Then you must go at once.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.339
Whoah whoah whoah!

08:31.511 --> 08:34.130
She's goin', we're goin' with her!

08:34.139 --> 08:35.597
Right, girls?

08:35.597 --> 08:38.433
Ooh, I'm so nervicited!

08:38.434 --> 08:41.395
You do realize that's
not a real word, right?

08:41.397 --> 08:44.357
I'm afraid I can't let you go.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.438
What? Why not?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.857
Sending all of you could
upset the balance

08:48.862 --> 08:50.526
of this alternate world,

08:50.530 --> 08:52.740
creating havoc that would
make it impossible

08:52.741 --> 08:55.360
for Twilight to get the crown
back from Sunset Shimmer.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.746
This is something Princess
Twilight must do alone.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.365
Time is of the essence.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.580
On the third day, when the
moon reaches its peak

09:03.585 --> 09:06.545
in the night sky,
the gateway will close.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.086
And once it does, it
will be another 30 moons

09:09.090 --> 09:11.709
before you will be able
to use it to return.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.801
- It's all right!
- Don't worry, Twilight!

09:12.802 --> 09:14.386
- You'll do fine!
- You'll be back before you know it!

09:14.554 --> 09:15.512
Great!

09:25.648 --> 09:27.607
Spike! No!

09:36.242 --> 09:39.612
Uh, Twilight?

09:39.621 --> 09:43.116
Huh? Spike,
you're not supposed to...

09:43.124 --> 09:45.493
Spike?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.086
Are you a dog?

09:48.797 --> 09:51.211
I think so.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.586
But I have no idea what you are!

09:56.054 --> 09:57.137
Huh?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.738
Twilight, you have
to get it together.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.164
What does the rest of me look like?

10:24.165 --> 10:27.456
Um, like you, only not you.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.328
Your muzzle's really small.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.171
My muzzle?

10:31.172 --> 10:34.633
Are you gonna scream again?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.805
Where are we?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.556
I don't know, but that must serve

10:44.561 --> 10:46.395
as the gateway back to Equestria.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.106
We need to find my crown

10:49.107 --> 10:50.668
as soon as possible
and get back there.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.564
I suggest we start searching
the castle first.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.031
Works for me.

11:05.874 --> 11:09.335
Yeah, I don't think that's how
the new you is supposed to...

11:15.091 --> 11:16.675
Whoa!

11:21.723 --> 11:24.684
Come on, Spike. I do not
want to be like this

11:24.685 --> 11:26.552
for longer than I have to.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.769
Look on the bright side.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.971
You don't have those pesky
wings to worry about anymore.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.271
Hmm.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.037
My magic. It isn't working.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.782
Makes sense. You don't
exactly have your horn.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.624
What?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.915
We really need to
find you a mirror.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.847
What do you think, Spike?

12:03.848 --> 12:06.718
Other artifacts she's
stolen from Equestria?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.104
What am I?

12:20.406 --> 12:21.774
Huh? Oh!

12:29.207 --> 12:30.290
Whoa!

12:30.291 --> 12:31.829
You Okay?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.720
I don't think this is a castle.

I'm really sorry.

14:04.052 --> 14:07.888
I just found it and I thought
I should give it to her.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.474
I didn't know you had dropped it.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.685
Well, I did, and I was
about to get it

14:12.852 --> 14:14.971
before you swooped in
and ruined everything!

14:14.979 --> 14:17.769
You shouldn't pick up things
that don't belong to you.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.439
It doesn't really
belong to you either.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.482
Excuse me?

14:22.487 --> 14:23.855
Nothing.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.071
That's what I thought.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.613
It's as good as mine
and you know it.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.406
You really are pathetic.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.621
It's no wonder your best
friends are all stray animals.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.832
How dare you speak to her that way?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.956
What did you say?

14:37.960 --> 14:42.548
I said, How dare you
speak to her that way?

14:45.009 --> 14:47.628
You must be new here.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.848
I can speak to anyone
any way I want.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.388
I can't believe you did that.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.890
I couldn't just stand there.

14:58.898 --> 15:03.144
Well, it's just that nobody ever
stands up to Sunset Shimmer.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.895
Sunset Shimmer?

15:06.948 --> 15:08.031
You've heard of her?

15:08.032 --> 15:09.570
Sort of.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.115
I don't think I've seen
you around before.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.738
Did you just transfer
to Canterlot High

15:13.746 --> 15:15.159
from another school?

15:15.164 --> 15:16.828
Um, yes.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.042
Another school.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.753
My name's Twilight.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.123
I'm... Fluttershy.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.251
Sorry, what was that?

15:26.259 --> 15:28.048
It's Fluttershy.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.216
It sounds like you're
saying "Fluttershy",

15:30.221 --> 15:32.761
but how can that...

15:32.932 --> 15:34.925
Oh, my goodness!

15:34.934 --> 15:37.769
Who's this sweet little guy?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.480
That's Spike, my, uh, dog.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.564
Oh, he's so cute!

15:41.566 --> 15:45.812
Go on, eat up, little pup!

15:50.116 --> 15:52.735
Wouldn't you just give anything

15:52.743 --> 15:54.782
to know what they're
really thinking?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.371
He usually just tells me.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.411
What do you mean?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.879
Oh, uh, nothing. Never mind.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.420
Sunset Shimmer said you
picked something up,

16:06.424 --> 16:07.792
something that belonged to her.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.964
It wasn't a crown, was it?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.758
How did you know?

16:11.762 --> 16:14.552
Uh, lucky guess?
Do you still have it?

16:14.557 --> 16:15.640
Huh-uh.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.976
But you know what happened to it.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.060
Mm-hmm.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.396
This morning, I was
passing out flyers

16:21.397 --> 16:24.392
for the animal shelter like
I do every Wednesday...

16:24.400 --> 16:27.144
Canterlot Animal Shelter
needs more volunteers.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.193
Won't you help an animal
that can't help itself?

16:37.371 --> 16:38.329
Ow!

16:40.041 --> 16:42.124
I have no idea how it got there,

16:42.125 --> 16:43.585
but I didn't want
anything to happen to it,

16:43.586 --> 16:45.830
so I decided to give it
to Principal Celestia.

16:46.005 --> 16:50.172
Principal Celestia?
She's the ruler here?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.716
You could say that.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.590
Technically I guess she
and Vice Principal Luna

16:55.598 --> 16:56.806
do make the rules.

16:56.807 --> 16:57.845
Where is she now?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.102
Probably in her office.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.393
Third door on your left.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.106
Thank you!

17:05.107 --> 17:06.896
Oh, wait!

17:06.901 --> 17:10.066
You're not really supposed to
have pets on school grounds.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.736
Might want to tuck him
into your backpack.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.108
That's what I do.

17:16.618 --> 17:20.114
They just get so lonely
when I'm at school all day.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.866
Oh, okay. Thank you!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.993
Oh no! I'm late for class!

17:30.174 --> 17:31.712
Come in.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.008
How may I help you?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.851
Um, uh, oof.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.520
My name's Twilight Sparkle.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.110
I'm new here, and, well,

17:50.111 --> 17:51.443
I understand that Fluttershy

17:51.444 --> 17:53.234
found a crown this morning
and gave it to you.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.824
Yes. I've had Vice Principal Luna

17:55.825 --> 17:57.284
put it somewhere for safekeeping.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.405
No idea how it ended
up on the front lawn.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.997
Were you interested in running

18:01.998 --> 18:03.912
for Princess of the
Fall Formal this year?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.997
Uh, no, not exactly.

18:06.002 --> 18:09.087
The truth is...
well, the truth is, I...

18:09.088 --> 18:11.707
you see... the crown is actually...

18:11.716 --> 18:13.800
Princess of the Fall Formal?

18:13.801 --> 18:15.840
It's Canterlot High's
big Fall dance.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.383
Like the Grand Galloping Gala.

18:17.388 --> 18:20.007
Uh, Grand Galloping Gala?

18:20.016 --> 18:25.228
Oh, uh, it was a big
deal at my old school.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.847
And was there a princess?

18:26.856 --> 18:29.726
Yes, but she wasn't
exactly a student.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.272
Here at Canterlot High

18:31.277 --> 18:34.021
the students select one of
their peers to represent them.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.614
She receives her crown
at the Fall Formal.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.153
Hmm.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.244
You asked if I was interested
in running for Princess.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.953
Can anyone run?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.705
Yes. You just need to let the head

18:43.706 --> 18:45.199
of the Fall Formal
Planning Committee

18:45.207 --> 18:46.620
know you'd like to
be on the ballot.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.119
Was there anything else?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.917
Um, nope. That was it.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.755
Well if you do need anything else,

18:52.757 --> 18:54.000
my door is always open.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.177
Twilight, why didn't
you just tell her

18:58.179 --> 18:59.547
the crown was yours
and ask for it back?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.924
Well, I was going to,

19:01.932 --> 19:04.676
but imagine if one of them
showed up in Equestria

19:04.685 --> 19:06.019
saying they came from a place

19:06.020 --> 19:07.433
filled with tall mushy
two-legged creatures

19:07.438 --> 19:09.727
with these, we'd think
they were crazy!

19:11.734 --> 19:13.602
Hmm. You make a good point.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.229
Looks like if I want my crown back,

19:15.237 --> 19:18.402
I'll have to become Princess of
the Canterlot High Fall Formal.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.571
So that's what I'm gonna do!

19:22.244 --> 19:24.988
And how exactly do you
plan on doing that?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.874
I have no idea!

19:41.514 --> 19:44.258
I know we've just met,
but I was wondering

19:44.266 --> 19:46.225
if you might be able to
help me with something.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.016
Of course.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.061
I've decided to run for Princess
of the Fall Formal, and...

19:54.276 --> 19:56.895
Oh, gosh! Sorry.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.318
It's just running for
Fall Formal Princess

19:59.323 --> 20:01.316
is a really bad idea.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.488
Why?

20:02.493 --> 20:04.953
Sunset Shimmer wants to
be Fall Formal Princess.

20:04.954 --> 20:08.040
And when she wants
something, she gets it.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.122
She'll make life awful for
anyone who stands in her way.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.871
Just ask the girl
who ran against her

20:13.879 --> 20:15.543
for Princess of the Spring Fling.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.757
I have to try.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.252
I don't think you understand.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.220
You'd have to convince
everyone here

20:22.221 --> 20:23.759
to vote for you instead of her...

20:23.764 --> 20:26.975
The athletes, the fashionistas,

20:26.976 --> 20:30.062
the dramas, the eco-kids,

20:30.229 --> 20:33.019
the techies, the rockers.

20:33.023 --> 20:36.063
Why is everypony...

20:36.235 --> 20:39.696
uh, everybody...
separated this way?

20:39.697 --> 20:41.986
Maybe it was different
at your old school,

20:41.991 --> 20:45.361
but at CHS, everybody
sticks to their own kind.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.613
One thing they do have in common

20:47.621 --> 20:49.455
is that they know Sunset Shimmer's

20:49.457 --> 20:52.417
gonna rule the school
until we graduate.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.002
Not if I can help it.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.884
So, where would I find the head
of the Party Planning Committee?

21:07.808 --> 21:10.302
Fluttershy said she'd
probably be in here.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.602
Incoming!

21:23.365 --> 21:25.950
Hi. My name's Twilight
Sparkle, and...

21:25.951 --> 21:27.239
Pinkie Pie?

21:30.539 --> 21:31.952
Are you psychic?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.291
Uh, no. I don't think so.

21:33.292 --> 21:37.288
Unless of course that's
something you can do here.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.834
Not usually.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.585
Fluttershy said this is
where I'd find the head

21:42.593 --> 21:44.177
of the Fall Formal Party
Planning Committee.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.422
Fluttershy, huh?

21:46.430 --> 21:48.549
Don't let the whole
shy thing fool you.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.550
She can be a real meanie.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.348
You two aren't friends?

21:52.353 --> 21:54.436
Waited a bit to get your
name on the ballot, huh?

21:54.437 --> 21:56.227
Dance is day after tomorrow.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.315
I'm brand new here.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.480
Ooh!

21:59.485 --> 22:01.399
I thought you didn't look familiar.

22:01.403 --> 22:05.319
Now that I'm really looking at you,

22:05.324 --> 22:07.317
do you have a twin sister
who lives in the city,

22:07.326 --> 22:10.867
has a pet dog named Spike that
looks just like that one?

22:10.871 --> 22:13.411
Uh, maybe?

22:13.415 --> 22:16.535
Thought so. Anyhoo,
just need to fill this out

22:16.544 --> 22:17.752
and you are officially
up for the coveted

22:17.753 --> 22:20.213
Princess of the Fall Formal Crown.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.396
Wow! You have really
bad handwriting!

22:39.400 --> 22:41.610
It's like you never
held a pen before.

22:41.611 --> 22:44.354
Is it?

22:44.363 --> 22:47.483
Somebody order a dozen cases
of fizzy apple cider?

22:47.491 --> 22:49.780
Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me! Me!

22:49.785 --> 22:50.993
Yeah, uh-huh, me!

22:52.872 --> 22:56.493
- Can you bring in the rest?
- Yep.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.954
Hey, I know you.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.752
You do?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.169
Sure. You're the new girl

23:04.174 --> 23:06.509
who gave Sunset Shimmer
the what-for today.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.887
Twilight Sparkle here is gonna
run against Sunset Shimmer

23:09.889 --> 23:12.508
for Princess of the Fall Formal!

23:14.810 --> 23:16.849
I'd think twice about that.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.564
Oh, sure, she'll probably
approach you all friendly-like...

23:23.152 --> 23:26.522
"I sure am looking forward to
some friendly competition."

23:26.530 --> 23:28.114
"That's so good to hear."

23:28.115 --> 23:31.656
But then here comes
the backstabbing.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.403
About the only girl at this school

23:33.412 --> 23:35.405
you can trust less
than Sunset Shimmer

23:35.414 --> 23:36.497
is Rainbow Dash.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.957
Rainbow Dash?

23:37.958 --> 23:40.119
She's the captain of like
every team at Canterlot High.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.921
She's also the captain of saying

23:43.923 --> 23:46.212
she's gonna do something for
you and then turning around

23:46.216 --> 23:48.255
and not even bothering to show up.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.049
Thanks for the advice, Applejack,

23:50.054 --> 23:51.888
but this is something
I really need to so.

23:51.889 --> 23:53.928
Suit yourself.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.894
Hey, how did you know
my name was Applejack?

23:56.895 --> 24:00.640
Um, I uh... Didn't you say?

24:00.648 --> 24:02.687
Here you go.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.060
Well, it was sure nice
meeting you both.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.858
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.448
That one's trying to hide a secret

24:10.449 --> 24:12.738
but I am totally onto her.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.578
She's psychic!

24:15.579 --> 24:18.119
Uh-huh. If you say so.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.785
This looks terrible!

24:23.337 --> 24:24.295
There should be more streamers

24:24.463 --> 24:26.206
near the stage and fewer balloons!

24:28.092 --> 24:30.301
Yeah! Streamers!

24:30.302 --> 24:32.466
And fewer balloons!

24:34.223 --> 24:35.807
Fizzy apple cider?

24:35.808 --> 24:39.053
Ugh! This is my coronation,
not a hoedown!

24:39.061 --> 24:43.523
Well, now, it ain't
necessarily gonna be

24:43.524 --> 24:45.643
your coronation this time around!

24:45.651 --> 24:47.986
Oh, is that so?

24:47.987 --> 24:50.652
You country folk really
aren't that bright.

24:50.656 --> 24:54.948
Must be why the other students
say such awful things about you.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.577
Obviously it's gonna
be my coronation.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.620
I'm running unopposed.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.618
Not this time. The new
girl just signed up.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.918
What?

25:06.922 --> 25:10.508
I know. Her handwriting
is really bad.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.094
Where is this "Twilight Sparkle"?

25:15.055 --> 25:16.896
I'm looking forward to
meeting the competition.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.617
Can't believe I didn't
recognize you earlier.

25:35.618 --> 25:38.236
Should've known Princess Celestia

25:38.245 --> 25:40.864
would send her prized pupil
here after my crown.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.037
And her little dog too.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.625
It's my crown.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.994
Whatever.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.792
This is just a minor
setback for me.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.789
You don't know the first
thing about this place

25:49.798 --> 25:52.087
and I already rule it.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.962
If that's so, why do you
even need my crown?

25:54.970 --> 25:56.634
You went to an awful lot of trouble

25:56.638 --> 25:58.427
to switch it with the
one that belongs here.

25:58.432 --> 26:00.221
Pop quiz.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.059
What happens when you bring
an Element of Harmony

26:02.061 --> 26:04.645
into an alternate world?

26:04.646 --> 26:07.311
You don't know? Seriously?

26:07.316 --> 26:10.276
And you're supposed to be

26:10.277 --> 26:12.691
Princess Celestia's star student?

26:12.696 --> 26:16.567
Then again, what were the
chances she'd find somepony

26:16.575 --> 26:18.658
as bright as me to
take under her wing

26:18.659 --> 26:20.619
after I decided to leave Equestria?

26:20.621 --> 26:24.412
Bit embarrassing that you
were the best she could do.

26:25.626 --> 26:28.961
Oh, and I'd keep an
eye on your mutt.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.627
Hate for him to be
taken away from you.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.751
Is that a threat?

26:33.759 --> 26:36.173
Oh, of course not.

26:36.178 --> 26:40.174
But I'd cut down on the
chatter if I were you.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.767
Don't want everyone to know
you two don't belong here,

26:42.768 --> 26:44.136
now would you?

26:44.144 --> 26:48.515
You want to be a princess
here? Please.

26:48.524 --> 26:51.485
You don't know the first
thing about fitting in.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.749
I want you to follow her.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.833
Bring me something I can use

27:07.835 --> 27:09.669
just like you did
with the last girl

27:09.670 --> 27:11.459
who thought she could challenge me.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.832
You got it, Sunset Shimmer.

27:13.841 --> 27:16.836
When the crown and
its power are mine,

27:16.844 --> 27:18.803
Twilight Sparkle will be sorry

27:18.804 --> 27:21.298
she ever set hoof into this world.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.799
Not that she would
have been much safer

27:22.808 --> 27:24.767
if she'd stayed in Equestria.

27:24.768 --> 27:28.229
Yeah. In Equestria.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.894
What are you still doing here?

27:29.898 --> 27:30.856
Go!

27:55.174 --> 27:56.542
Excuse me.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.762
The great, and powerful Trixie!

28:02.556 --> 28:03.924
Needs some peanut butter crackers.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.769
Voilà!

28:11.106 --> 28:12.770
Sunset Shimmer is right.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.018
I don't know the first
thing about this place.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.771
If I'm going to really
fit in and win votes,

28:17.779 --> 28:19.147
we need to do some research.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.198
Research?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.534
This place has a school.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.946
I have to believe it's
got a... Library!

28:29.291 --> 28:30.659
Got your phone?

28:31.752 --> 28:32.995
Got yours?

28:44.973 --> 28:48.468
So I just push the letters here

28:48.477 --> 28:52.564
and then the words and moving
pictures will come up here?

28:56.151 --> 28:57.610
That's right.

28:59.529 --> 29:02.774
Maybe this place does have magic.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.743
<i>♪ When you're a younger... ♪</i>

29:12.751 --> 29:15.791
Girls, what are you doing?

29:15.796 --> 29:19.758
We're just seeing how many hits
our new music video has gotten.

29:19.759 --> 29:23.128
<i>♪ So the three of
us fight the fight! ♪</i>

29:23.136 --> 29:25.221
<i>- ♪ There is nothing... ♪</i>
- No. Just...

29:25.222 --> 29:26.635
No.

29:26.640 --> 29:30.010
The school computers are
for research purposes only.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.477
It's just as well, y'all.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.473
Some of the comments about
our song were really awful.

29:34.481 --> 29:35.689
"Epic fail".

29:35.691 --> 29:38.401
"Funniest thing I've ever seen"?

29:38.402 --> 29:41.818
Funniest thing they've
ever seen, huh?

29:41.822 --> 29:45.317
Uh, I don't know that that's
what you should take from...

29:59.673 --> 30:02.383
Whoa!

30:05.262 --> 30:06.220
Shhhhh!

30:34.291 --> 30:37.957
The library will be
closing in five minutes.

30:39.880 --> 30:43.201
I hadn't even thought about where
we're going to sleep tonight.

30:44.301 --> 30:45.885
Way ahead of you.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.680
It's a little dusty.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.891
But it doesn't seem like
anybody comes up here.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.265
It's perfect, Spike.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.150
So, how did your research go?

31:05.155 --> 31:06.489
I found this book.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.233
It's called a "Yearbook".

31:08.241 --> 31:10.200
It seems to be something they use

31:10.202 --> 31:12.491
to keep a record of things that
have happened at the school.

31:12.496 --> 31:13.784
Look.

31:13.789 --> 31:17.708
That's Pinkie Pie, Rainbow
Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy,

31:17.876 --> 31:20.666
and I'm going to bet the girl
on the far right is Rarity.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.254
There's a Rarity here?!

31:22.255 --> 31:25.796
Uh, I mean uh, interesting photo.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.966
It's interesting because they
look like they're friends.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.055
They do look like our friends.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.970
But I thought we'd figured
that out already.

31:32.974 --> 31:36.890
No. I mean, they look like
they're friends with each other.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.981
But it doesn't seem like
they're friends now.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.690
Not so much.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.901
I just can't help
but get the feeling

31:43.902 --> 31:46.021
that Sunset Shimmer had
something to do with it.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.988
I wouldn't put it past her.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.529
But she wanted your crown

31:50.534 --> 31:52.744
'cause she's planning on
doing something even worse.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.449
If you're going to stop her,

31:54.454 --> 31:56.698
you have to focus on
making friends here.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.995
You can't worry about why these
girls aren't friends anymore.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.588
Even if they do remind you
of your Ponyville friends.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.127
You're right, Spike.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.923
Eye on the prize.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.220
Good morning, students,
and happy Thursday.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.093
Just a reminder to
pick up your ballots

32:17.102 --> 32:19.095
for the Princess of the
Fall Formal today.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.393
They are due by the time the
dance starts tomorrow night,

32:21.398 --> 32:23.767
so don't forget to turn them in
and make your voice heard.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.815
Fluttershy said I'd need to win
over all those different groups

32:26.820 --> 32:28.779
if I want to become Princess
of the Fall Formal,

32:28.780 --> 32:31.069
so I've compiled a list
of talking points.

32:31.074 --> 32:34.034
You made a list?

32:34.035 --> 32:36.028
That's so unlike you.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.832
Uh.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.326
Please. Continue.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.498
I'll start introducing myself.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.792
Sprinkle in some of things
I've learned about their world

32:45.964 --> 32:49.550
into the conversation.
Show them how I fit in here.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.129
Okay, Spike.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.802
Time to make a good
first impression

32:54.973 --> 32:55.931
on my fellow students.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.183
The whole world sort
of depends on it.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.106
Hey, look!

33:11.114 --> 33:13.028
Why is everybody
looking at me funny?

33:13.033 --> 33:14.992
Whoa!

33:14.993 --> 33:17.453
What are you...? Why did you...?

33:17.454 --> 33:19.322
Rarity?

33:25.420 --> 33:27.254
Perfect.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.671
Ooohh yes! This is good.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.134
No one will recognize you.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.003
Why wouldn't I want to be...?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.550
And we'll need a
disguise for your dog.

33:35.555 --> 33:39.801
Which is too bad.
He really is so adorable.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.552
You know, with a little work,

33:41.561 --> 33:43.020
I think I could make him
look like a rabbit instead.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.104
Huh?

33:44.105 --> 33:46.019
A rabbit?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.733
There you are, Twilight.

33:47.734 --> 33:50.023
So much for the disguise.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.862
I've been lookin' all over for ya.

33:51.863 --> 33:52.946
Me too.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.031
Me three.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.867
I like your new look.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.279
I do have an eye for
these sorts of things.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.404
Not that you seem to care.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.576
What?!

34:01.581 --> 34:03.074
Why do you think she doesn't care?

34:04.876 --> 34:06.710
No. Never mind.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.204
Why were you all looking for me?

34:08.213 --> 34:09.295
What's going on?

34:09.297 --> 34:12.087
Oh. She hasn't seen it yet.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.208
Seen what?

34:15.262 --> 34:18.382
Oh, it's really not that bad.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.304
Twilight Sparkle wants to be

34:20.308 --> 34:22.051
your Fall Formal Princess.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.056
But what does it say
about our school

34:27.065 --> 34:29.309
if we give someone like this...

34:31.235 --> 34:33.571
such an important honor?

34:37.074 --> 34:38.739
I...

34:38.743 --> 34:41.612
I take that back. It's pretty bad.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.409
But this all happened yesterday.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.908
At the library.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.626
Has everyone in the
school seen this?

34:47.627 --> 34:50.087
Is that why they were all
looking at me that way?

34:50.088 --> 34:52.081
Mmmm...

34:52.090 --> 34:53.503
What am I going to do?

34:53.507 --> 34:56.127
No one is going to vote
for me after seeing this.

34:56.136 --> 34:57.800
Not that it'll make any difference,

34:57.804 --> 34:59.923
but I'll still vote for you.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.932
You were so nice to stand up for me

35:02.100 --> 35:05.095
when Sunset Shimmer was
picking on me yesterday.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.641
If you still want to run,

35:06.646 --> 35:08.230
maybe there's something
I can do to help.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.271
Word of advice.
Don't accept her help.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.520
She doesn't take
anything seriously.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.318
Why do you have to
be so awful to me?

35:16.323 --> 35:17.736
Oh, pphht!!

35:17.741 --> 35:19.700
Don't play innocent, Pinkie Pie.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.285
You're no better than she is.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.246
And what is that supposed to mean?

35:24.247 --> 35:27.958
I am happy to offer up
my assistance as well

35:27.959 --> 35:30.954
to someone who would appreciate
what I have to offer!

35:38.011 --> 35:39.424
Listen to y'all carryin' on!

35:39.429 --> 35:41.969
Get over it and move on!

35:41.973 --> 35:43.841
You mean like how
you've gotten over

35:43.850 --> 35:45.559
what happened with Rainbow Dash?

35:45.560 --> 35:47.428
She said she'd get
the softball team

35:47.437 --> 35:48.975
to make an appearance
at my bake sale.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.765
I tell everybody they're comin',

35:50.774 --> 35:52.608
and then not one of 'em shows up.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.978
She made a liar outta me.
That's different.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.316
Is not!

35:56.321 --> 35:57.404
Is too!

36:04.579 --> 36:06.072
Stop!

36:06.081 --> 36:07.164
All of you!

36:07.165 --> 36:08.829
I want to show you something.

36:10.460 --> 36:13.545
You were friends once.

36:13.546 --> 36:17.587
The Freshman Fair. Y'all remember?

36:17.592 --> 36:18.675
Yes...

36:18.677 --> 36:20.011
But something happened.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.513
I think that something
was Sunset Shimmer.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.758
Well, it's a nice theory, darling,

36:24.766 --> 36:27.010
but Sunset Shimmer had
nothing to do with it.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.268
She's right.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.887
Sunset Shimmer isn't the one

36:29.896 --> 36:31.896
who ruined my silent auction
for the animal shelter

36:31.898 --> 36:34.017
by bringing fireworks
and noisemakers.

36:34.192 --> 36:38.859
It was supposed to be a serious
event and Pinkie Pie ruined it.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.481
What are you talking about?

36:40.490 --> 36:42.074
I got a text from you saying

36:42.075 --> 36:45.320
that you didn't want a silent
auction, you wanted a big party.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.038
I never sent you a text.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.577
You didn't?

36:49.582 --> 36:50.745
You don't think she's the one

36:50.750 --> 36:51.913
who's been sending me
those emails, do you?

36:51.918 --> 36:54.082
Every time I volunteer
to help with decorations

36:54.087 --> 36:56.752
at a school function, I get
an e-mail from Pinkie Pie

36:56.756 --> 36:58.715
saying she has plenty
of volunteers.

36:58.717 --> 37:02.087
And then I find out she's
done everything herself.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.805
I never sent you any e-mails.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.050
Maybe she's the reason Rainbow Dash

37:07.058 --> 37:08.767
didn't show up for my bake sale.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.433
Didn't you ever ask Rainbow
Dash why she didn't show up?

37:11.438 --> 37:16.060
I guess I kinda stopped talkin'
to her at all after that.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.569
Maybe now would be
a good time to start.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.114
They're actually talking.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.240
That's a good sign.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.089
Hugs! Hugs are always good.

37:39.090 --> 37:42.711
Somebody, and I think
we can all guess who,

37:42.719 --> 37:44.802
told Rainbow Dash that my bake sale

37:44.803 --> 37:46.164
had been moved to a different day.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.303
Dash showed up with
all the softball team

37:48.308 --> 37:50.051
and thought I'd cancelled on her.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.394
So, you're looking to
dethrone Sunset Shimmer

37:52.395 --> 37:54.809
and become Princess of
the Fall Formal, huh?

37:56.441 --> 37:59.777
Gotta say I'd really
love to see that happen.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.442
I'll totally help you out.

38:01.446 --> 38:05.192
All you gotta do is beat me
in a game of one-on-one.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.283
What?

38:06.284 --> 38:08.152
First to five goals wins.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.072
One-zip.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.885
That's game!

39:08.429 --> 39:12.550
I really thought you were going
to pull it off there in the end.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.520
So, what's the plan?

39:16.521 --> 39:18.514
How can I help you be Princess
instead of Sunset Shimmer?

39:18.523 --> 39:22.860
But, I lost.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.776
Of course you lost. I'm awesome.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.569
But I'm not gonna help just anybody

39:27.574 --> 39:29.192
try and beat Sunset Shimmer.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.281
The Fall Formal Princess
should be someone

39:31.286 --> 39:33.405
with heart and determination.

39:33.413 --> 39:35.281
You proved you've got 'em both.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.140
And can I get mine with extra oats?

39:53.141 --> 39:54.429
Oats?

39:54.434 --> 39:56.678
Uh, scratch that.

39:56.686 --> 39:58.850
However you normally
make it is fine.

40:06.905 --> 40:10.446
Oh, we've got to stop bumping
into each other like this.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.538
You know me, always trying to
make a big splash around here.

40:16.539 --> 40:21.536
'Cause my drink, kind of
splashed on the ground.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.463
I'm gonna go over there now.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.265
Don't even think about it.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.510
You're already trying
to get her crown.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.227
Who knows what Sunset
Shimmer would do

40:39.228 --> 40:41.267
if you ended up getting
her ex-boyfriend too.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.058
I'm not trying to...
I don't even know...

40:44.067 --> 40:46.777
We just accidentally...
Ex-boyfriend?

40:46.778 --> 40:50.069
Flash Sentry broke up
with her a few weeks ago.

40:50.073 --> 40:52.613
I can't believe she hasn't done
something awful to him yet.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.828
Maybe she's just waiting
until she has the power

40:59.832 --> 41:01.746
to do something really awful.

41:01.751 --> 41:04.621
All right girls, dance
is tomorrow night

41:04.629 --> 41:06.543
and we still don't know how
we're gonna get Twilight

41:06.547 --> 41:08.040
the votes she needs
to be named Princess.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.168
Right now folks only
know the Twilight

41:10.176 --> 41:12.295
from that video Sunset
Shimmer posted online.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.714
We need to help 'em
see her differently.

41:14.722 --> 41:15.805
Hmmm...

41:15.807 --> 41:17.391
Yes...

41:17.392 --> 41:18.475
We got it!!!

41:22.397 --> 41:24.390
I mean...

41:24.399 --> 41:26.063
perhaps I have a solution.

41:26.067 --> 41:29.107
Now this may be an absolutely
preposterous idea,

41:29.112 --> 41:32.482
but what if tomorrow we all
wore these as a sign of unity?

41:33.950 --> 41:36.033
Freshman year they were
very very popular.

41:36.034 --> 41:38.028
A way for everybody to
show their school spirit.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.531
You know, "Go Canterlot
Wondercolts!"

41:40.540 --> 41:43.501
I haven't sold any in ages.

41:43.502 --> 41:47.122
I mean, the five of us are
obviously very different

41:47.130 --> 41:50.421
but deep down we're all
Canterlot Wondercolts.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.714
Sunset Shimmer is the
one who divided us.

41:52.719 --> 41:55.008

Take those off!

45:41.072 --> 45:43.691
I have something I need you to do.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.167
So like, these ears
are pretty cool.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.918
Doesn't everyone
look just fabulous?

45:58.923 --> 46:00.632
It was a great idea, Rarity.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.882
Don't know what she's
smiling about.

46:04.887 --> 46:07.722
Twilight's the one that's gonna
be Princess of the Fall Formal.

46:14.855 --> 46:18.601
Vice Principal Luna, something
terrible has happened!

46:21.988 --> 46:24.197
Isn't this just awful?

46:24.198 --> 46:28.569
And after Pinkie Pie worked so
hard to make things so perfect.

46:28.577 --> 46:32.573
Why would Twilight Sparkle
do something like this?

46:32.581 --> 46:34.415
Why would you think
Twilight was responsible

46:34.417 --> 46:35.580
for something like this?

46:35.584 --> 46:37.873
Because I have proof.

46:43.718 --> 46:46.303
But, but I don't understand.

46:46.304 --> 46:49.799
This is clearly you in the
photographs, is it not?

46:53.811 --> 46:54.849
Yes, but...

46:54.854 --> 46:56.688
I think it should be fairly obvious

46:56.689 --> 46:58.478
that the school cannot let someone

46:58.482 --> 46:59.725
who would do something like this

46:59.734 --> 47:01.773
compete for the Fall Formal crown.

47:06.824 --> 47:10.661
Vice Principal Luna, I found these
in a trash can in the library.

47:10.662 --> 47:13.121
I thought you should see them.

47:13.122 --> 47:15.491
Someone obviously
combined these photos

47:15.499 --> 47:17.959
to make it look like Twilight was
the one who trashed the gym.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.706
I appreciate you bringing
this to my attention, Flash.

47:21.714 --> 47:24.208
In light of this new evidence,

47:24.216 --> 47:26.175
you may of course continue your bid

47:26.177 --> 47:28.717
to be crowned the Princess
of the Fall Formal.

47:28.721 --> 47:30.089
Thank you!

47:30.097 --> 47:32.807
You have no idea how
important this is to me.

47:34.101 --> 47:37.062
What was I going to do?
Not prove your innocence?

47:37.063 --> 47:39.898
Wouldn't be much of a Canterlot
Wondercolt, would I?

47:39.899 --> 47:42.689
I am afraid enough damage
has been done to the gym

47:42.860 --> 47:45.695
that we will have to postpone
the dance until tomorrow night.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.572
If you'll excuse me,

47:47.573 --> 47:50.659
I need to let my sister know
about this latest development.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.113
So, uh, I was wondering...

47:54.121 --> 47:56.615
If you aren't already
going with somebody,

47:56.624 --> 47:58.743
want to go to the Fall Formal
with me tomorrow night?

48:01.796 --> 48:04.381
That would be... tomorrow night?

48:04.382 --> 48:06.000
No. No no no no no no!

48:06.008 --> 48:07.592
No. No no no no!

48:07.593 --> 48:08.881
I can't... The portal.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.221
That'll be too late!

48:11.222 --> 48:13.056
One "no" would've been fine!

48:23.401 --> 48:25.190
Everything okay in there?

48:25.194 --> 48:27.938
Yes. Only it's not okay.

48:27.947 --> 48:29.440
It's not okay at all.

48:29.448 --> 48:30.816
If I don't get my crown tonight,

48:30.825 --> 48:34.741
I won't be able to go back to
Equestria for another 30 moons.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.452
Oh, what are we going to do?

48:37.456 --> 48:40.621
Hmm... we tell them the truth.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.415
Let them know what's
really at stake

48:42.420 --> 48:43.752
if you don't get the crown tonight.

48:43.753 --> 48:45.622
They'll help us
figure something out.

48:45.631 --> 48:47.169
But what if they won't?

48:47.174 --> 48:49.884
What if when they find out just
how different I really am?

48:51.971 --> 48:54.215
Twilight, these girls
rallied around you

48:54.223 --> 48:56.342
because they saw what
was in your heart.

48:56.350 --> 48:57.934
They aren't going to feel
any differently about you

48:57.935 --> 49:00.679
when they find out you're a
Pony Princess in Equestria.

49:02.940 --> 49:05.275
I'm glad you followed
me here, Spike.

49:05.276 --> 49:09.738
Me too. Unless of course we get
stuck here for another 30 moons.

49:11.740 --> 49:13.278
You Okay?

49:13.284 --> 49:15.573
The Fall Formal isn't
happening tonight.

49:15.578 --> 49:16.786
What?

49:16.787 --> 49:18.200
It had to be postponed

49:18.205 --> 49:19.948
because Sunset Shimmer
had Snips and Snails

49:19.957 --> 49:22.121
ruin all of Pinkie
Pie's decorations.

49:22.126 --> 49:23.334
What?

49:23.335 --> 49:26.045
But the Fall Formal has
to happen tonight.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.630
Wha...?

49:31.635 --> 49:32.923
You see...

49:33.971 --> 49:35.054
You're from an alternate world

49:35.055 --> 49:36.593
and you're a pony princess there

49:36.599 --> 49:38.137
and the crown actually has a
magical element embedded in it

49:38.142 --> 49:39.806
that helps power up
other magical elements

49:39.810 --> 49:40.973
and without it they
don't work anymore

49:40.978 --> 49:42.596
and you need them to help
protect your magical world

49:42.605 --> 49:44.018
and if you don't get
the crown tonight

49:44.023 --> 49:45.106
you'll be stuck in this world

49:45.107 --> 49:46.395
and you won't be able to get back

49:46.400 --> 49:48.234
for like a really,
really long time!

49:52.031 --> 49:55.276
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that isn't the reason.

49:55.284 --> 49:57.152
No. She's pretty much spot on.

49:57.161 --> 49:58.495
He can talk?

49:58.496 --> 50:00.079
Oh, yeah.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.290
And back where I come
from, I'm not even a dog.

50:02.291 --> 50:06.207
I am a ferocious
fire-breathing dragon!

50:06.212 --> 50:08.922
This is so amazing!

50:08.923 --> 50:11.008
Tell me, what are you
thinking right now?

50:14.637 --> 50:17.006
Sure would love a scratch
behind the old ears.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.427
Gah...

50:18.432 --> 50:20.050
Uh, maybe later.

50:20.059 --> 50:21.927
How did you know all that?

50:21.936 --> 50:23.099
Just a hunch.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.471
Wait a minute.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.098
Let me get this straight.

50:26.106 --> 50:27.644
You're a pony?

50:27.650 --> 50:29.643
You're a princess?

50:29.652 --> 50:31.861
You're from another world?

50:31.862 --> 50:33.855
Mm-hmm.

50:33.864 --> 50:37.735
That is... awesome!

50:40.246 --> 50:41.910
See. Told ya.

50:45.626 --> 50:48.791
I simply cannot believe
they did all this.

50:48.796 --> 50:51.415
If I only had some
kind of Party Cannon

50:51.423 --> 50:53.837
that could decorate
everything super fast.

50:53.842 --> 50:58.304
I know it seems impossible, but
maybe if we all work together?

50:58.305 --> 51:00.719
Now that's the kind
of can-do spirit

51:00.724 --> 51:03.184
I'm lookin' for in a
Fall Formal Princess.

51:03.185 --> 51:04.723
Let's do it, y'all!

51:04.728 --> 51:06.062
Absolutely!

51:06.063 --> 51:07.146

53:13.190 --> 53:15.309
Fall Formal is back
on for this evening.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.405
So you'd better get out of
here and start getting ready.

53:20.406 --> 53:22.240
Oh. And don't forget
to cast your ballots

53:22.241 --> 53:24.574
for Fall Formal Princess
on your way out.

53:24.575 --> 53:26.114
You got my vote, Twilight.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.988
Mine, too.

53:29.081 --> 53:30.039
Mine, too.

53:33.585 --> 53:36.329
You're lucky she was
able to pull this off.

53:36.338 --> 53:38.457
Next time I ask you to
make a mess of things,

53:38.465 --> 53:40.709
try to show a little restraint.

53:40.718 --> 53:42.801
I need this formal to go on tonight

53:42.802 --> 53:44.262
just as much as she does.

53:46.348 --> 53:50.059
I still can't believe
we pulled that off.

53:50.060 --> 53:52.520
I can. We're awesome!

53:52.521 --> 53:55.311
Enough chatter, girls.
We need to get ready.

53:55.315 --> 53:57.855
And we need to look fabulous!

55:29.159 --> 55:30.743
Twilight!

55:32.412 --> 55:34.701
Look, I know you said no about
going to the Fall Formal with me

55:34.706 --> 55:38.577
but would you reconsider and
at least have one dance?

55:38.585 --> 55:40.954
I didn't say no.

55:40.963 --> 55:45.380
I mean, I did, but
I didn't mean no to you.

55:45.384 --> 55:46.547
I was...

55:46.552 --> 55:49.092
what I mean is, yes.

55:49.096 --> 55:50.634
I'd love to dance with you.

56:13.954 --> 56:15.947
Anybody seen Sunset Shimmer?

56:15.956 --> 56:18.200
Maybe she was too
embarrassed to show.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.915
She's gotta know you
won by a landslide.

56:20.919 --> 56:22.253
Maybe.

56:29.303 --> 56:30.635
First off I want to say

56:30.636 --> 56:32.596
how wonderful everything
looks tonight.

56:32.598 --> 56:35.092
You all did a magnificent
job pulling things together

56:35.100 --> 56:37.765
after the unfortunate
events of earlier.

56:37.769 --> 56:40.434
And now, without further ado,

56:40.439 --> 56:42.103
I'd like to announce the winner

56:42.107 --> 56:44.442
of this year's Fall Formal Crown.

56:46.403 --> 56:50.649
The Princess of this
year's Fall Formal is...

56:53.493 --> 56:55.452
Twilight Sparkle!

57:03.503 --> 57:06.088
Congratulations, Twilight.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.629
Twilight! Help!

57:12.638 --> 57:13.596
Spike?

57:17.434 --> 57:18.802
They got Spike!

57:41.625 --> 57:43.209
That's close enough.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.083
Twilight!

57:51.218 --> 57:52.586
Don't hurt him.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.553
Oh I wouldn't dream of it.

57:54.554 --> 57:56.343
I'm not a monster, Twilight.

57:56.348 --> 57:57.511
Let him go.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.888
You don't belong here.

58:03.897 --> 58:07.609
Give me the crown and you can
go back to Equestria tonight.

58:07.610 --> 58:10.103
Or keep it and never go home.

58:11.655 --> 58:13.398
Tick-took, Twilight.

58:13.407 --> 58:14.900
We haven't got all night.

58:14.908 --> 58:17.322
The portal will be closing on
its own in less than an hour.

58:17.494 --> 58:19.487
So...

58:19.496 --> 58:20.989
what's your answer?

58:24.668 --> 58:25.751
No.

58:25.752 --> 58:26.835
What?

58:26.837 --> 58:28.546
Equestria.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.836
Your friends. Lost to you forever.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.675
Don't you see what I'm
about to do to the portal?

58:32.676 --> 58:34.885
Yes. But I've also seen

58:34.886 --> 58:37.596
what you've been able to
do here without magic.

58:37.597 --> 58:39.590
Equestria will find
a way to survive

58:39.599 --> 58:41.137
without my Element of Harmony.

58:41.143 --> 58:45.264
This place might not if I allow
it to fall into your hands.

58:45.272 --> 58:48.062
So go ahead. Destroy the portal.

58:48.066 --> 58:50.731
You are not getting this crown.

58:51.903 --> 58:54.522
Fine. You win.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.825
You are so awesome!

59:00.829 --> 59:03.323
Can't believe you were
gonna do that for us.

59:03.331 --> 59:06.417
It's no wonder you're
a real live princess.

59:07.836 --> 59:10.580
Yes. She's so very special.

59:20.223 --> 59:21.431
Grab him, you fools!

59:31.651 --> 59:33.815
Spike!

59:40.577 --> 59:41.694
Fluttershy!

59:54.591 --> 59:56.300
I'll take that.

59:56.301 --> 01:00:00.137
At last.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:03.633
More power than I
could ever imagine.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.644
This is gonna be so cool!

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.915
I've had to jump through
so many hoops tonight

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:15.789
just to get my hands on this crown

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:19.418
and it really should have
been mine all along.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.847
But let's let bygones be bygones.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:28.093
I am your Princess now.

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:31.266
And you will be loyal to me.

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:53.164
Round them up and bring
them to the portal.

01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:58.797
Spoiler alert.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:02.714
I was bluffing when I said I was
going to destroy the portal.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.714
I don't want to rule this
pathetic little high school.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.262
I want Equestria.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:11.557
And with my own little
teenage army behind me,

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.687
I'm going to get it.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:19.811
No. You're not.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:20.982
Oh, please.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:24.073
What exactly do you think
you're going to do to stop me?

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:29.322
I have magic and you have nothing.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.789
She has us.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:41.792
Gee, the gang really is
all back together again.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.135
Now step aside.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:48.006
Twilight has tried to
interfere with my plans

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:50.007
one too many times already.

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:52.226
She needs to be dealt with.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.646
What?

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.533
The magic contained in my Element

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.827
was able to unite with those
that helped create it.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.762
Honesty.

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:36.144
Kindness.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.570
Laughter.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.869
Generosity.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:00.294
Loyalty.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.880
Magic.

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.550
Together with the crown,

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.842
they create a power beyond
anything you could imagine.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.589
But it is a power

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:13.341
you don't have the
ability to control.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.015
The crown may be upon your
head, Sunset Shimmer,

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.603
but you cannot wield it,

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:20.690
because you do not possess the
most powerful magic of all...

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.942
the Magic of Friendship.

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:34.578
What is happening?

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.913
Here and in Equestria,

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:42.332
it is the only magic that
can truly unite us all.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:29.421
You will never rule in Equestria.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:32.091
Any power you may have had
in this world is gone.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:35.636
Tonight you've shown
everyone who you really are.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.850
You've shown them what
is in your heart.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:41.472
I'm sorry.

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:44.189
I'm so sorry.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.979
I didn't know there
was another way.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:49.149
The Magic of Friendship doesn't
just exist in Equestria.

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:50.943
It's everywhere.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:56.034
You can seek it out.
Or you can forever be alone.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.950
The choice is yours.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.165
But all I've ever
done since being here

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.159
is drive everyone apart.

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:05.912
I don't know the first
thing about friendship.

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:10.500
I bet they can teach you.

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:13.048
Those are my girls! Woo hoo!

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:15.466
Did that dog just talk?
Whoa. Weird.

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.716
Seriously?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.184
The talking dog is the weird
thing about all this?

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.268
I for one think you're adorable.

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:24.354
Oh, Yeah.

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:28.066
I believe this belongs to you.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:30.356
A true Princess in any world

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.447
leads not by forcing
others to bow before her,

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:37.364
but by inspiring others
to stand with her.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:40.989
We have all seen that you
are capable of just that.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:45.209
I hope you see it too,
Princess Twilight.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:48.670
I do.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:54.586
Would now be a
completely awkward time

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:56.178
to ask you for that dance?

You'll look out for her, won't you?

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:01.986
Of course we will.
Although I do expect

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:04.203
some sort of apology
for last spring's debacle.

01:08:04.204 --> 01:08:05.914
I have a feeling

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.375
she'll be handing out
a lot of apologies.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.045
We'd better get going.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.792
I know we've only been
friends for a short time,

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.419
but I'm going to miss
all of you so much.

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:27.432
That crown really does suit
you, Princess Twilight.

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:28.930
You know what, Spike,

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.939
I am starting to feel a little
more comfortable wearing it.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.309
And the wings?

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:35.107
I've been walking on two legs

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.854
and picking things up with these.
Wings?

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:40.984
I'm thrilled that's all I'll be
dealing with back in Equestria.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.544
Oh, bummer.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:11.555
Twilight!

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.728
You're back!

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:14.975
You got your crown!

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.270
I knew you could do it!

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.738
Oh! We were so worried.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.858
Sunset Shimmer. Is she all right?

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.984
I think she's going to be fine.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.323
I left her in good hands.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:29.118
What are hands?

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:35.795
Where did you stay?

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:36.880
What did they wear?

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:37.964
Did ya have fun?

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:39.207
What did you eat?

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:40.505
Would you say she's
just as awesome as me?

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:43.675
I want to tell you
everything. I do.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.220
But I'm just so exhausted
from all the dancing.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.182
Dancing?

01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:52.971
We've got to stop bumping
into each other like this.

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.898
Who was that?

01:09:57.902 --> 01:09:59.691
He's a new member of
the Castle Guard.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:02.566
Flash Sentry, I think. Why?

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:03.861
Do you know him?

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.325
Not exactly.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.240
Oooh!

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:09.580
Somepony's got a crush
on the new guy.

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:11.198
No. No I don't.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:12.791
She does!

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:14.535
She absolutely does.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:18.335
Don't be ridiculous. I don't
even know him. He just...

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:20.253
Totally reminds you of a guy
you met in that other world

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:21.546
who played guitar and was in a band

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.089
and helped prove you didn't
destroy all the decorations

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.962
for a big dance so you could
still run for princess

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:27.715
of the big dance and then asked
you to dance at that dance...

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:29.808
Right?

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.143
How did you know that?

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.012
