00:00.290 --> 00:02.011
Previously
on "Criminal Minds"...

00:02.306 --> 00:03.506
It would be nice
if we saw each other

00:03.590 --> 00:06.142
more than once
every 3 or 4 years.

00:06.703 --> 00:08.287
So, give me the updates.

00:08.372 --> 00:09.739
Anybody serious
in your life?

00:09.790 --> 00:11.824
No, there isn't.

00:11.909 --> 00:14.494
I think she's putting
some feelers out

00:14.578 --> 00:18.414
to see if that old spark
is still there.

00:18.465 --> 00:19.999
Is it?

00:20.083 --> 00:21.167
I'm crazy, right?

00:21.435 --> 00:24.036
We don't always get second
chances in life, Rossi.

00:24.104 --> 00:26.172
Hey, what's
going on with you?

00:26.239 --> 00:28.808
Last year I was diagnosed
with ALS,

00:28.875 --> 00:30.909
Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.494
It won't be long now.

00:32.579 --> 00:34.830
I came to ask you,

00:34.914 --> 00:37.416
when it's time,
will you help me end my life?

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074

00:49.000 --> 00:50.734
Cool night,

00:50.802 --> 00:52.553
still water,

00:52.621 --> 00:54.872
just the way
the fish like it.

00:54.940 --> 00:56.357
Mm-hmm.

00:57.859 --> 01:00.727
You could at least
act like you're having fun.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.748
Mom told me never to lie.

01:06.117 --> 01:09.286
No one likes a smart-ass.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.343
You haven't caught
anything either.

01:16.411 --> 01:19.296
Can we go in now?

01:19.381 --> 01:22.016
Not until
we hook our dinner.

01:23.218 --> 01:25.919
I thought you were
drinking yours tonight.

01:27.138 --> 01:28.555
What did you say?

01:35.897 --> 01:39.266
You got a real attitude
problem, you know that?

01:41.736 --> 01:43.904
Take your shirt off.

01:43.955 --> 01:45.456
Sorry.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.075
Sir, it won't happen again.

01:50.295 --> 01:52.212
Take your shirt off.

02:13.268 --> 02:15.291
You're never gonna grow up
to be a man

02:15.316 --> 02:16.718
if you don't learn respect.

02:16.938 --> 02:19.573
Uhh! Uhh!

02:19.640 --> 02:21.241
No wonder your mother left.

02:21.309 --> 02:24.528
She couldn't face
having a worthless...

02:26.314 --> 02:27.247
Arrogant...

02:27.315 --> 02:29.083
Uhh!

02:29.150 --> 02:30.951
Bastard for a son.

02:31.002 --> 02:33.253
Aah! Aah!

02:33.321 --> 02:36.457
Aah!

02:58.513 --> 03:01.732
Nick. Nick! Wake up.

03:01.816 --> 03:04.201
We saw something going on
across the lake,

03:04.285 --> 03:06.036
so we left to check it out.

03:06.121 --> 03:08.038
What do you mean,
you guys left?

03:08.123 --> 03:09.790
Listen, bro,
we tried to wake you.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.792
Dude, you gotta
get over here.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.243
How?
You took the canoes.

03:13.328 --> 03:15.129
There are police everywhere.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.030
They found a body
in the lake.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.334
Look across.

03:23.805 --> 03:26.056
Got another one.
Can you give me a hand?

03:27.642 --> 03:28.759
Hold it.

03:28.843 --> 03:30.177
They've--
there's another body.

03:30.228 --> 03:32.062
I can't see anything.
Come back and get me.

03:32.147 --> 03:34.481
Ok. Sam is heading
your way now.

03:34.549 --> 03:36.683
She'll be there
in a couple of minutes.

03:40.155 --> 03:42.272
Who's that with you?

03:42.357 --> 03:43.273
What? No one.

03:43.358 --> 03:44.908
I'm alone.

03:44.993 --> 03:46.944
Nick, look out!

03:47.028 --> 03:49.980
Nick! Nick, are you there?

03:50.048 --> 03:51.498
Nick!

03:51.566 --> 03:54.201
Nick! What the hell
is going on?!

04:01.092 --> 04:04.511
I so don't miss that face.

04:04.579 --> 04:07.798
No matter how many cases
we solve, there's always more.

04:07.882 --> 04:12.085
Insert Dr. Reid's statistic
about active serial killers

04:12.137 --> 04:13.753
at any given time here.

04:15.557 --> 04:17.641
Reid?

04:18.726 --> 04:20.194
Spencer...

04:20.261 --> 04:21.894
There's something wrong.

04:21.946 --> 04:23.564
Why do you say that?

04:23.615 --> 04:25.315
He's been reading
the same page

04:25.400 --> 04:27.901
for 16 minutes
and 24 seconds.

04:27.952 --> 04:29.786
Maybe it's a really
good article.

04:29.871 --> 04:31.122
It's never taken him longer
than 11 minutes,

04:31.147 --> 04:32.347
17 seconds to turn a page.

04:33.992 --> 04:37.711
You time how long it...

04:38.963 --> 04:40.164
What's your theory?

04:40.248 --> 04:43.917
I'm extrapolating
probabilities as we speak.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.223
Oh, hey. Rossi, you think
you could help me

04:49.290 --> 04:51.258
with a consult for Wildwood PD?

04:51.309 --> 04:52.476
Uh, sure.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.095
Now, that I noticed.

04:55.146 --> 04:57.631
Is something going on?

04:58.816 --> 05:01.101
How did it go
the other night?

05:01.152 --> 05:02.853
What happened
the other night?

05:02.937 --> 05:04.154
You Ok?

05:04.239 --> 05:07.107
Well, why wouldn't I be?

05:08.276 --> 05:11.195
You seem distracted.

05:11.279 --> 05:13.914
I'm considering a purchase.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.785
Come on, now, Rossi,
you know we're not buying that.

05:18.836 --> 05:20.454
What's really going on?

05:20.505 --> 05:24.091
Look, it was
a late night with Ringo

05:24.158 --> 05:26.210
and not enough coffee.

05:26.294 --> 05:27.711
I mean, the guy's
a world-class drummer,

05:27.795 --> 05:29.880
but don't think I didn't
wipe the floor with him

05:29.964 --> 05:31.348
in rock band.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.383
All right, what do you think?

05:33.468 --> 05:36.720
He could be
telling the truth.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.005
I only played him
to the easy level.

05:39.057 --> 05:40.340
I can't tell.

05:40.391 --> 05:42.359
And you never will.

05:43.978 --> 05:45.896
Let's get started.

05:53.705 --> 05:56.707
Ok, this is Ridge Canyon Lake

05:56.791 --> 05:59.293
in California's Angeles
National Forest.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.129
It's a popular destination
for water sport enthusiasts.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.697
Unfortunately, some campers
have discovered

06:03.748 --> 06:07.417
someone has chosen murder
as their sport of choice.

06:07.502 --> 06:11.371
3 victims, all male,
all found early this morning.

06:11.422 --> 06:13.974
He used an underwater
disposal site?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.642
Mm-hmm. He weighed them down
with rocks and then he hid

06:15.710 --> 06:17.844
their bodies underneath shrubbery
around the lake's edge.

06:17.895 --> 06:20.134
That's pretty risky,
keeping a graveyard

06:20.159 --> 06:21.265
at a popular lake.

06:21.266 --> 06:23.267
This guy is showing
confidence early.

06:23.351 --> 06:24.718
Well, we should run priors
in the area.

06:24.769 --> 06:26.219
This might not be
his first party.

06:26.271 --> 06:28.221
All 3 victims were reported
missing last week,

06:28.273 --> 06:29.823
and each of the bodies
was discovered

06:29.890 --> 06:31.491
more than 30 miles from
where they went missing.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.110
Any indication
of sexual assault?

06:33.194 --> 06:34.674
No external signs, but time

06:34.699 --> 06:35.946
in the water might have
destroyed evidence.

06:35.947 --> 06:37.397
Autopsies are being
conducted now.

06:37.448 --> 06:38.832
And I'm gonna
make matters worse.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.952
This is Nick Skirvin and he was
abducted early this morning.

06:42.036 --> 06:43.670
Witness reports
indicate a blitz attack.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.071
His friends
were on the water

06:45.123 --> 06:46.456
and saw a figure
strike Nick from behind

06:46.541 --> 06:48.175
just before
they lost contact.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.043
Could they give
a description?

06:50.094 --> 06:51.878
Probably white,
definitely male.

06:51.929 --> 06:53.413
Nothing more specific.
They said the unsub

06:53.464 --> 06:56.416
had dragged Nick into the woods
by the time they reached the shore.

06:56.467 --> 06:57.751
Fast and efficient,

06:57.802 --> 06:59.586
and he is unafraid
of a heavy police presence.

06:59.637 --> 07:02.022
If he's dumping the bodies
in one location,

07:02.089 --> 07:04.024
it's a good bet the area
means something to him.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.693
He probably lives
in or near the forest.

07:06.761 --> 07:08.779
Unfortunately,
Angeles National Forest

07:08.863 --> 07:11.315
1,016 square miles
of terrain,

07:11.399 --> 07:14.034
ranging in elevation
from 1,200 to 10,064 feet.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.870
Which means that if the unsub
is familiar with the area,

07:16.937 --> 07:19.990
Nick Skirvin
could be anywhere.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.698
No!

08:15.682 --> 08:18.183
That's not why mom left.

08:18.251 --> 08:20.890
What did you say?

08:20.891 --> 08:25.962
I said, that's not why
mom left.

08:26.013 --> 08:27.981
Is that right?

08:28.065 --> 08:32.018
Huh. She said 'cause
your rod was broken.

08:32.102 --> 08:33.679
And this whole time,

08:33.714 --> 08:35.634
I thought she was
talking about fishing!

08:39.827 --> 08:41.778
Uhh!

09:04.835 --> 09:07.136
"To die
is poignantly bitter,

09:07.187 --> 09:08.671
"but the idea
of having to die

09:08.722 --> 09:10.640
without having lived
is unbearable."

09:10.691 --> 09:12.141
Erich Fromm.

09:12.192 --> 09:13.476
With no apparent evidence

09:13.527 --> 09:15.445
of physical violence
or sexual assault,

09:15.512 --> 09:16.980
we could be looking at an unsub

09:17.031 --> 09:18.347
who gets off
on the torture of drowning.

09:18.399 --> 09:20.516
So what's the significance
of the water burial?

09:20.567 --> 09:22.652
Is he visiting the dump sites
to relive his crimes,

09:22.703 --> 09:25.154
or is he using it
as a forensic countermeasure?

09:25.205 --> 09:26.789
It could be both.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.825
If the dump site's doubling
as his trophy collection,

09:28.876 --> 09:30.359
he won't be happy
it's been disturbed.

09:30.411 --> 09:31.828
He'll want to make
a new one quickly.

09:31.879 --> 09:33.796
Uh, guys, I'm afraid
that's just happened.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.332
Nick Skirvin's body
has been recovered,

09:36.383 --> 09:37.834
only it wasn't found
in Ridge Canyon,

09:37.885 --> 09:39.352
it was found in Lake Banter,

09:39.420 --> 09:41.704
which is 20 miles away.
Visual aid to follow.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.007
And postscript,
you do not want to know

09:44.058 --> 09:47.877
how many hits you get if you
Google this forest plus murder.

09:47.928 --> 09:50.179
To say it should be called the
Angeles National unsub dump site

09:50.230 --> 09:51.514
is an understatement.

09:51.565 --> 09:53.049
How was the body
recovered so quickly?

09:53.100 --> 09:55.351
It wasn't way down.
Nick's body was just found

09:55.402 --> 09:57.186
at the edge of the lake
by some campers.

09:57.237 --> 09:58.437
Garcia, start compiling
a list of missing persons

09:58.462 --> 09:59.862
and crimes in the area.

10:00.223 --> 10:02.075
Faster than a Hotch rocket.

10:03.961 --> 10:06.112
So the unsub knew that his
burial site had been compromised,

10:06.180 --> 10:08.698
and he adapted by venturing
outside his comfort zone.

10:08.749 --> 10:11.200
And he changed
his victimology.

10:11.251 --> 10:14.087
Look at Nick Skirvin compared to
the other 3 victims.

10:14.171 --> 10:16.372
They were all dark-haired,
well-built men,

10:16.423 --> 10:18.624
but Nick
is an average blond.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.293
He could be
an impulsive kill,

10:20.377 --> 10:21.878
not thought out
like the others.

10:21.929 --> 10:23.412
Then why not submerge
the body?

10:23.464 --> 10:25.598
Allowing it to be uncovered
so soon seems counterintuitive

10:25.683 --> 10:28.768
to the self-preservation
instincts he's displayed so far.

10:28.852 --> 10:31.054
The disturbance of
his old disposal site

10:31.105 --> 10:32.588
could have thrown him
off his game.

10:32.639 --> 10:34.423
Or he's trying
to shake us.

10:34.475 --> 10:35.851
By using another lake,
he just doubled the size

10:35.876 --> 10:37.076
of his killing field.

10:37.594 --> 10:39.595
And our search area.

10:44.952 --> 10:47.570
This is even more isolated
than Ridge Canyon.

10:47.621 --> 10:49.605
He's gotta be local.

10:49.656 --> 10:51.074
Hey, did your team
come this way?

10:51.125 --> 10:53.442
All right, it looks like
he dragged Nick up through here.

10:53.494 --> 10:55.762
That path comes from
the direction of the road.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.047
There's no waterway
connecting the two lakes.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.333
It's 44 miles
from the abduction site.

11:00.417 --> 11:02.835
With the forest
smack in between.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.171
A truck or a camper
would conceal his victims.

11:05.255 --> 11:06.789
If he's dragging
his victims,

11:06.840 --> 11:08.608
he's probably too weak
to carry them.

11:08.675 --> 11:09.726
He might have switched
to a smaller target

11:09.793 --> 11:10.793
to help navigate
his terrain.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.679
He also he didn't weigh
this body down.

11:13.764 --> 11:15.681
Maybe he can't complete his ritual
without the proper surrogate.

11:15.766 --> 11:17.183
If that's the case,
then killing Nick

11:17.267 --> 11:18.568
didn't get the unsub
his release.

11:18.635 --> 11:21.303
He's already looking
for his next victim.

11:23.524 --> 11:25.808
Ok. So, we all need
life vests.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.477
We can get them
at the rental shack.

11:30.614 --> 11:31.697
Whoo.

11:34.535 --> 11:37.336
I think it's right up here.

11:55.055 --> 11:57.506
We were on the two-way...

11:57.558 --> 12:00.193
And then he was gone.

12:00.277 --> 12:02.862
I never should have
left him.

12:02.946 --> 12:05.681
You said you saw a man
at the campsite?

12:05.732 --> 12:07.567
We were too far away
to help.

12:07.651 --> 12:11.120
I paddled as hard
as I could, but...

12:11.188 --> 12:12.455
Phinny.

12:12.522 --> 12:14.690
This wasn't your fault.

12:14.741 --> 12:17.577
Try telling that
to my parents.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.197
You find the son of a bitch
who killed my brother.

12:21.248 --> 12:23.666
We will. But first
I need to know,

12:23.717 --> 12:26.669
is it possible that Nick
met someone at the lake

12:26.720 --> 12:28.370
that would have followed him?

12:28.422 --> 12:30.590
We hung out with a lot
of people last night.

12:30.674 --> 12:32.842
There was a party
on the beach.

12:32.893 --> 12:34.727
Did Nick make
any new friends?

12:37.431 --> 12:40.316
Nick always makes friends.

12:40.383 --> 12:43.436
Do you remember
if anyone stuck out,

12:43.520 --> 12:45.938
looked like
they didn't belong?

12:53.130 --> 12:56.165
Ok, thank you, ma'am.
Bye.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.500
Anything?

12:57.567 --> 12:59.819
Unsub blends in
with a younger crowd.

12:59.887 --> 13:02.622
I'd say we're looking at mid-20s
to early 30s. You?

13:02.706 --> 13:04.173
Well, he's methodical.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.009
Social, too. He's been able
to isolate all of his victims.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.679
The mother of Jake Shepherd,
our first victim,

13:09.746 --> 13:12.832
said there were several members
of their church at the lake that day.

13:12.900 --> 13:16.018
But Jake was the only one
with brown hair.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.020
He matched the age preference
of the unsub.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.689
Nick's brother Phinny's
a brunette,

13:19.756 --> 13:21.524
and he's
a lot like these guys.

13:21.591 --> 13:22.859
Why not go after him?

13:22.926 --> 13:24.060
I don't know.

13:24.111 --> 13:25.945
He chose Nick Skirvin
for a reason.

13:26.029 --> 13:28.030
We need to figure out why.

13:32.870 --> 13:34.453
Aah! Ha ha ha!

13:48.618 --> 13:50.452
Damn it.

13:50.504 --> 13:52.672
I'm out of gas!

14:11.909 --> 14:13.326
All the victims
were drowned,

14:13.410 --> 14:15.361
but the first victim,
Jake Shepherd, was asphyxiated

14:15.445 --> 14:16.779
before being submerged.

14:16.830 --> 14:19.282
Jake was the biggest. The unsub
may have had to strangle him

14:19.333 --> 14:20.666
to render him unconscious
for the drowning.

14:20.751 --> 14:22.785
He wasn't just unconscious.

14:22.836 --> 14:24.337
There was pretty intense
damage to the trachea.

14:24.421 --> 14:25.955
He was dead before
going in the water.

14:26.006 --> 14:29.959
But with Nick, he used a blow to
the head to incapacitate him,

14:30.010 --> 14:33.629
so this unsub wants his victims alive
when he drowns them.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.997
This is
the interesting part.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.383
In all 4 victims,
evidence of broken ribs

14:37.467 --> 14:39.852
and damage to the sternum
indicate severe chest compression,

14:39.937 --> 14:41.938
yet there are no signs
of external trauma.

14:42.005 --> 14:45.441
So somebody attempted
to perform CPR on these victims?

14:45.508 --> 14:48.110
And was successful.
Inflammation to the lungs

14:48.178 --> 14:50.896
indicates matter expulsion
prior to brain death.

14:50.981 --> 14:53.065
He kills them, then
resuscitates them. Why?

14:53.150 --> 14:54.573
We've seen hero complexes
before. Rodney Alcala killed

14:54.598 --> 14:56.398
and resuscitated his victims.
These unsubs get off

14:56.453 --> 14:59.655
on the power of bringing
people back from the dead.

14:59.706 --> 15:01.157
Well, he's not
a very good hero, is he?

15:01.208 --> 15:02.408
His victims didn't survive.

15:02.492 --> 15:03.993
Dr. carroll,
is it possible to tell

15:04.044 --> 15:06.996
if any of these victims were
resuscitated more than once?

15:07.047 --> 15:08.497
The indicator is
the inflammation of the lungs,

15:08.548 --> 15:11.300
combined with broken ribs.
Severe inflammation could

15:11.368 --> 15:14.170
theoretically point toward
multiple resuscitations.

15:14.221 --> 15:16.389
Ok, given that theory,
how many of the 4?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.814
All but the first victim,
Jake Shepherd.

15:24.881 --> 15:27.266
The guy might have tried, but
with the damage to Jake's throat,

15:27.351 --> 15:30.102
he wouldn't have been able to
expel the water from his lungs.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.360
You need a hand?

15:38.395 --> 15:39.328
Yeah.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.231
Hi, I'm--I'm Chase.
Here.

15:42.282 --> 15:44.166
Lacey.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.868
Here, let me help you
with that.

15:51.074 --> 15:53.793
I thought I was never
gonna get this thing out.

15:53.877 --> 15:55.795
The damn thing
ran out of gas.

15:55.879 --> 15:59.248
Oh, no worries. I'll give you
a lift back to the dock.

15:59.299 --> 16:02.018
I should probably
stay with the jet ski.

16:02.085 --> 16:03.100
Are you kidding?

16:03.125 --> 16:04.464
Didn't you hear what
happened this morning?

16:05.255 --> 16:06.972
The bodies?

16:07.057 --> 16:09.692
Yeah, it's crazy, right?

16:09.759 --> 16:11.193
Who knows where that guy is?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.145
Better that thing
be on its own than you.

16:16.766 --> 16:18.451
You're right.

16:21.405 --> 16:23.823
It looks like we're definitely
looking at a sadist.

16:23.907 --> 16:25.324
Killing them once
isn't enough.

16:25.409 --> 16:26.659
He has to resuscitate
his victims

16:26.743 --> 16:27.993
until he can't
bring them back again.

16:28.078 --> 16:30.963
So why the change from choking
to multiple drowning?

16:31.048 --> 16:32.381
With the damage to Jake's
throat, the unsub

16:32.449 --> 16:34.667
wasn't able to successfully
resuscitate him.

16:34.751 --> 16:36.485
Resuscitating them makes him
feel more powerful.

16:36.553 --> 16:39.972
Which means he has no power
in his everyday life.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.225
But the change in victimology
is interesting.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.010
Nick Skirvin
was the smallest,

16:45.095 --> 16:47.596
but he had the most
defensive wounds on his body.

16:47.647 --> 16:49.365
He fought back the most.

16:49.433 --> 16:51.934
Maybe the unsub was injured
in one of the attacks.

16:51.985 --> 16:54.970
He's targeting easier prey
to complete his end game.

16:58.692 --> 16:59.641
Excuse me.

16:59.693 --> 17:00.860
There's something else.

17:00.944 --> 17:03.195
The M.E. tested diatom levels
in the bodies

17:03.280 --> 17:04.914
and it turns out the unsub
drowns his victims

17:04.981 --> 17:06.749
at different locations
every time, not just where

17:06.816 --> 17:09.417
he abducts them or where
the bodies are later discovered.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.867
Well, that's pretty risky,
considering the community's

17:10.892 --> 17:13.232
on full alert.
This guy's intelligent,

17:13.233 --> 17:15.276
resourceful, and criminally
sophisticated.

17:15.959 --> 17:19.345
Why is transporting
the bodies so important to him?

17:27.170 --> 17:30.672
Come on, Lacey, please?
Wake up.

17:39.816 --> 17:42.017
Wake up!

17:42.068 --> 17:44.203
Wake up!

17:45.522 --> 17:48.357
Come on!

17:48.408 --> 17:50.025
Wake up!

17:50.076 --> 17:52.912
Wake up! Wake up!

17:55.188 --> 17:56.188
Chase, wake up!

17:59.593 --> 18:01.277
Damn it, wake up!

18:27.274 --> 18:28.370
Stop.

18:51.912 --> 18:54.497
He killed a woman this time.
This guy's all over the map.

18:54.582 --> 18:57.149
Diatom readings indicate he did
move the body after he drowned her.

18:57.201 --> 18:59.752
Postmortem wounds--overkill
consistent with rage.

18:59.820 --> 19:02.321
Is he unraveling because we took
away his underwater graveyard?

19:02.373 --> 19:05.458
She lasted longer
in the fight than Nick Skirvin.

19:05.509 --> 19:07.326
This feels desperate.

19:07.378 --> 19:08.845
Take a look at this.

19:08.929 --> 19:12.298
There was blood on the body that
didn't match type to the victim.

19:12.349 --> 19:14.267
It shows a severely low
white blood cell count.

19:14.334 --> 19:15.768
I'm running tests
to be more conclusive.

19:15.836 --> 19:17.387
If this unsub is sick
and getting weak,

19:17.471 --> 19:20.056
it would explain why he's no
longer weighing his victims down.

19:20.140 --> 19:22.191
The only consistency
to his M.O.

19:22.276 --> 19:24.310
is the drowning
and resuscitation.

19:24.361 --> 19:26.529
That's what's most
important to him.

19:26.597 --> 19:28.648
If that's the case, I'd say
he isn't too happy right now.

19:28.699 --> 19:29.649
Why is that?

19:29.700 --> 19:31.117
There's bruising
consistent with CPR,

19:31.184 --> 19:32.986
but no inflammation
of the lungs,

19:33.037 --> 19:34.153
no signs of expulsion.

19:34.204 --> 19:36.355
She wasn't successfully
revived.

19:37.875 --> 19:40.476
The unsub, or unknown
subject we're looking for

19:40.544 --> 19:42.629
is a white male
in his mid- to late 20s.

19:42.696 --> 19:44.547
He dumped Nick Skirvin's
body in Banter Lake

19:44.632 --> 19:47.166
and then was compelled
to circle back to Ridge Canyon.

19:47.217 --> 19:49.335
We believe, therefore,
that he's local to the area.

19:49.386 --> 19:51.971
This unsub is a sadist
with a God complex.

19:52.039 --> 19:54.474
He gets off by killing
his victims over and over again.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.310
But it's vital that he's able to
bring them back from the dead.

19:57.377 --> 19:59.596
He went from choking and carrying
fit men to their watery graves

19:59.680 --> 20:02.348
to drowning and dumping
smaller victims unceremoniously.

20:02.399 --> 20:04.285
Diatom levels indicate that
he has now

20:04.310 --> 20:06.009
stopped moving
his victims altogether.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.987
I'm sorry, diatom levels?

20:08.055 --> 20:09.188
Diatoms are algae in water

20:09.239 --> 20:11.365
that help us pinpoint time
and location of drowning.

20:11.366 --> 20:13.417
Because of the changes
to his behavior,

20:13.502 --> 20:16.304
we believe he's most likely
been injured or sick.

20:16.371 --> 20:18.205
He's definitely
experienced in CPR.

20:18.257 --> 20:20.040
We need to look
at doctors, lifeguards,

20:20.092 --> 20:22.426
anyone with training
in resuscitation.

20:22.511 --> 20:24.545
You should put younger cops
on the lakes undercover,

20:24.596 --> 20:25.846
see if they
can lure him out.

20:25.897 --> 20:27.598
The smaller, less
imposing ones you can find,

20:27.683 --> 20:29.150
the better.

20:29.217 --> 20:31.152
We could grab a couple guys
from the Academy.

20:31.219 --> 20:32.320
Perfect.
But move quickly.

20:32.387 --> 20:33.988
He's accelerated
his attack schedule.

20:34.055 --> 20:35.940
He won't wait long
to strike again.

20:46.067 --> 20:48.736
Damn it. Where's the spare?

20:49.921 --> 20:52.173
I think that is the spare.

20:52.240 --> 20:55.693
Of course there's no reception.

20:55.761 --> 20:57.511
There was a gas station,

20:57.579 --> 20:59.079
about a mile back.
You want me to hoof it,

20:59.131 --> 21:00.548
see if they have any tires?

21:00.599 --> 21:03.367
No, you stay with the car.
The walk will calm me down.

21:03.435 --> 21:04.385
Mom.

21:04.436 --> 21:06.253
What?

21:06.305 --> 21:07.972
Are you kidding me?

21:08.056 --> 21:09.807
I think after this
I deserve one.

21:09.891 --> 21:12.443
And I deserve a mother
who lives to see me graduate.

21:16.598 --> 21:18.232
You're a good son.

21:18.283 --> 21:20.484
No matter what
anyone else might say.

21:20.569 --> 21:21.485
Funny.

21:21.570 --> 21:23.454
I'll be back
within an hour.

21:23.538 --> 21:26.540
No getting a pack
at the station either.

21:26.608 --> 21:28.793
Love you.

21:47.128 --> 21:50.731
I take it that wasn't Ringo
inviting you to another party

21:50.799 --> 21:52.566
on the phone yesterday.

21:56.104 --> 21:58.105
It was Carolyn.

21:59.825 --> 22:02.660
She has ALS.

22:06.782 --> 22:08.866
Rossi, I'm--

22:10.836 --> 22:12.953
what do you need?

22:14.289 --> 22:16.707
It's not what I need, Emily.

22:16.792 --> 22:19.126
It's what she's
asking me to do.

22:24.516 --> 22:27.167
The disease is acting quickly.

22:27.219 --> 22:28.719
Carolyn is already suffering,

22:28.804 --> 22:31.222
and she doesn't want
to go out that way.

22:31.306 --> 22:35.175
She wants to die
on her own terms.

22:40.198 --> 22:44.034
And when this case is over
and we get back...

22:46.738 --> 22:49.857
She asked if I would
help her do it.

22:57.382 --> 22:58.966
What are you gonna do?

22:59.033 --> 23:02.703
I don't have a choice.

23:16.685 --> 23:18.853
Oh, God.

23:21.523 --> 23:23.107
Is everything Ok, ma'am?

23:23.191 --> 23:25.893
Can you help me, please?
I got a flat just up the road

23:25.944 --> 23:27.528
and my son Evan
is waiting on me.

23:27.579 --> 23:30.448
Sure. Hop in.
I'll give you a lift.

23:30.532 --> 23:31.899
Thanks.

23:33.168 --> 23:35.419
That was Dr. Carroll.
Preliminary test results

23:35.504 --> 23:38.756
show the unsub has cancer
of the blood. He's dying.

23:38.840 --> 23:39.742
All right, wait a minute.

23:39.767 --> 23:41.539
Witnesses said Jake Shepherd,
the first victim,

23:41.576 --> 23:43.577
was out on the lake
for a baptism, right?

23:43.628 --> 23:44.728
He was with
his congregation.

23:44.796 --> 23:46.347
Well, those water burials
can be seen

23:46.414 --> 23:47.848
as a form of baptism, too.

23:47.916 --> 23:49.717
Especially dealing with an
unsub who has a God complex.

23:49.768 --> 23:52.466
What if there's a religious
or spiritual motivation

23:52.491 --> 23:53.691
to why the unsub is doing this?

23:56.758 --> 23:58.526
Speak and be heard.

23:58.593 --> 24:01.261
Garcia, I need you to pull a
list of patients in the area

24:01.313 --> 24:02.696
with any form
of blood cancer.

24:02.764 --> 24:04.732
I will make HIPAA
my bitch, sir.

24:04.783 --> 24:07.267
I also need information
on Jake Shepherd.

24:07.319 --> 24:09.370
Religious ties, spiritual
background, anything.

24:09.437 --> 24:12.706
Oh, all that information
will make for a fast search.

24:12.774 --> 24:15.242
Give me a mo...spiritual,

24:15.293 --> 24:18.212
something heaven sent,
other than my angelic self.

24:18.279 --> 24:20.548
Bam.

24:20.615 --> 24:21.582
Whoa.

24:21.633 --> 24:23.551
Jake Shepherd joined the church

24:23.618 --> 24:25.753
after a near-death experience
changed his life.

24:25.804 --> 24:27.254
What happened to him?

24:27.305 --> 24:29.340
He was in an ATV accident,
he coded for 4 minutes,

24:29.424 --> 24:31.592
he was life-flighted to L.A.
where they managed to revive him,

24:31.643 --> 24:33.894
but clinically he did die.

24:33.962 --> 24:35.829
Death and resuscitation.

24:35.897 --> 24:37.580
That sounds a little
too similar to our unsub's

24:37.605 --> 24:39.355
M.O. to be a coincidence.

24:39.734 --> 24:42.353
All right, Garcia, dig deeper.
Jake Shepherd's death wasn't random.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.188
It's on like Obi-Wan.

24:44.272 --> 24:45.656
Garcia out.

24:45.740 --> 24:47.324
So a terminally ill unsub
targets a man

24:47.409 --> 24:49.827
who came back from the dead
and then starts killing repeatedly.

24:49.911 --> 24:51.662
I mean, am I crazy,
or is this about a guy

24:51.746 --> 24:53.998
trying to come to terms
with his own death?

24:54.082 --> 24:56.166
Finding out you're gonna die isn't
enough to make somebody a psychopath.

24:56.251 --> 24:58.836
It does, however, explain why he
stopped strangling his victims.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.955
How do you find out
about death?

25:01.006 --> 25:04.909
You ask someone
who died.

25:04.976 --> 25:09.179
Is he bringing these victims
back so he can talk to them?

25:13.184 --> 25:15.436
Evan. Are you Evan?

25:15.503 --> 25:18.772
Are you Evan?
Is--is your name Evan?

25:18.840 --> 25:20.841
Is your mom Samantha?

25:20.892 --> 25:22.309
Yeah, that's me.
What's going on?

25:22.360 --> 25:24.278
You have to come quickly.
There's been an accident.

25:24.345 --> 25:25.896
- Your mom's been hurt.
- What happened? Where is she?

25:25.981 --> 25:27.481
Come with me.

25:53.075 --> 25:54.725
Hello?

26:01.700 --> 26:03.668
Who's there?

26:03.735 --> 26:08.923
Chase...Chase...Chase...

26:19.718 --> 26:21.636
Aah!
Chase!

26:21.720 --> 26:25.640
Aah! Aah!

26:25.708 --> 26:28.726
Aah...Aah...Aah!

27:12.137 --> 27:14.022
Come on.

27:14.106 --> 27:15.523
Come on.

27:24.133 --> 27:25.366
Did you see it?

27:25.451 --> 27:28.202
In the darkness,
the light.

27:28.287 --> 27:29.537
Did you see?

27:29.621 --> 27:31.456
Mom?

27:35.094 --> 27:37.712
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

27:37.796 --> 27:39.847
What did you see?

27:39.932 --> 27:42.800
Jeepers, the more I dig,
the more peculiar it gets.

27:42.851 --> 27:45.103
Ok, the first victim,
Jake Shepherd,

27:45.170 --> 27:47.505
had an interesting life,
and I'm using interesting

27:47.556 --> 27:50.358
in place of the phrase,
"He was a big hoodlum."

27:50.442 --> 27:53.311
He had a history of truancy,
petty theft, domestic disturbances,

27:53.362 --> 27:56.147
all of which landed him
in the juvenile hall

27:56.198 --> 27:58.349
for some stints during high school,
as you can imagine.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.984
Was there trouble
at home?

28:00.035 --> 28:01.786
Not at all.

28:01.854 --> 28:04.856
Jake just fell in
with the wrong crowd.

28:04.923 --> 28:06.424
What kind of crowd?

28:06.492 --> 28:08.359
The drug and sexy
parties kind.

28:08.410 --> 28:10.711
But all of that changed

28:10.796 --> 28:13.314
after his accident
6 months ago.

28:13.382 --> 28:15.333
After he...Died.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.635
Oh...

28:17.702 --> 28:20.704
He didn't just die.

28:20.756 --> 28:22.039
He was saved.

28:22.091 --> 28:24.392
Jake Shepherd saw the light,
like literally.

28:24.476 --> 28:26.928
He spoke of a gentle light

28:27.012 --> 28:30.047
and a silhouetted figure bathed
in warmth who welcomed him

28:30.099 --> 28:32.016
but told him
it wasn't his time.

28:32.067 --> 28:34.235
He woke up a changed man.

28:36.772 --> 28:38.556
He believed.

28:38.607 --> 28:41.609
If this unsub
is so obsessed with death,

28:41.693 --> 28:43.661
then Jake Shepherd was the
perfect person to talk to.

28:43.728 --> 28:45.163
He'd been there
and back again.

28:45.230 --> 28:47.665
But come on, guys.
Gentle lights, shadowy figures?

28:47.732 --> 28:49.534
Those are the lights
in the emergency room

28:49.585 --> 28:52.286
and the doctors hovering
over the patients. We all know that.

28:52.371 --> 28:54.205
No one actually sees
the afterlife.

28:54.256 --> 28:55.957
I did.

28:57.092 --> 28:58.843
Before Tobias Hankel
resuscitated me,

28:58.910 --> 29:00.678
I had that exact experience.

29:00.745 --> 29:02.797
And I wasn't in
an emergency room.

29:02.881 --> 29:04.098
I was in a shed.

29:04.183 --> 29:06.100
Reid, you never
told me that.

29:06.185 --> 29:09.020
I'm a man of science. I didn't
know how to deal with it.

29:09.087 --> 29:12.390
There's no quantifiable
proof that God exists,

29:12.441 --> 29:14.058
and yet, in that moment

29:14.109 --> 29:16.760
I was faced with something
that I couldn't explain.

29:16.812 --> 29:18.095
I still can't.

29:19.615 --> 29:22.150
What if this unsub has had
a similar experience

29:22.217 --> 29:24.652
and this is his way
of looking for answers?

29:24.736 --> 29:27.004
If that's the case,
why kill Jake Shepherd?

29:27.072 --> 29:28.789
Why not just talk to him?

29:28.874 --> 29:33.044
He wanted to see if he had
the same experience as before.

29:33.111 --> 29:35.163
Once isn't enough?

29:35.247 --> 29:39.000
Not if Jake didn't see the
same thing the unsub did.

29:39.084 --> 29:43.171
He wants to know
if the experience can change.

29:43.255 --> 29:45.089
I can relate to that.

29:47.926 --> 29:53.414
But...Reid felt a warmth
and saw a light.

29:53.482 --> 29:55.466
When I coded
in the ambulance,

29:55.517 --> 29:57.935
all I felt was cold
and darkness.

29:59.655 --> 30:01.829
And I would like to think
that there's a different

30:01.854 --> 30:03.246
future waiting for me.

30:03.475 --> 30:05.610
You actually died?

30:06.811 --> 30:09.947
All right, but resuscitation
is hit or miss.

30:09.998 --> 30:12.250
He can't guarantee that he can
actually bring anyone back,

30:12.317 --> 30:14.368
let alone that anyone
will remember what happened

30:14.453 --> 30:16.587
in their moment
so-called death.

30:16.655 --> 30:18.656
Reid, what's the best way
to make sure

30:18.724 --> 30:21.209
his victims
had an experience?

30:21.293 --> 30:24.212
Keep them dead longer.

30:39.528 --> 30:42.846
I think your mom needs a break.

30:45.534 --> 30:47.318
Let's see how you do.

30:47.369 --> 30:48.619
Aah!

30:51.623 --> 30:52.873
All right, thanks.

30:52.958 --> 30:55.883
An SUV's just been found
abandoned near Ridge Canyon Lake.

30:55.885 --> 30:57.841
The car belongs
to a Samantha Braun.

30:58.126 --> 30:59.842
Park log shows that she was
there with her son Evan.

30:59.864 --> 31:01.332
Let's go.

31:17.190 --> 31:18.484
He's abducted two at once.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.402
He needs a spot on the lake
where he can control them.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.521
Somewhere isolated that gives
him the time he needs

31:22.572 --> 31:24.189
for his resuscitation
ritual.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.908
How would he keep them
dead longer, Reid?

31:25.992 --> 31:27.276
There's a saying in
the medical community

31:27.360 --> 31:29.411
that you're not dead
until you're warm and dead.

31:29.496 --> 31:31.530
Colder water temperatures
could lead to hypothermia,

31:31.581 --> 31:34.083
which would offer the best chance
for successful reanimation.

31:34.167 --> 31:36.001
Conferencing Garcia.

31:36.069 --> 31:37.202
Give it to me, baby.

31:37.253 --> 31:38.904
Garcia, our unsub's
got two more victims

31:38.955 --> 31:41.590
and he's most likely taking them to
the coldest part of Ridge Canyon Lake.

31:41.675 --> 31:43.241
We need to intercept him.
What have you got?

31:43.293 --> 31:46.045
Ok, checking
water temperatures.

31:46.096 --> 31:48.747
Now we have several cold spots.

31:49.816 --> 31:51.750
What's with the pinging,
Penelope?

31:51.801 --> 31:54.219
The colder spots just matched the
most recent victims' diatom levels.

31:54.270 --> 31:57.356
The unsub's been getting
colder and colder the whole time.

31:57.423 --> 32:00.040
Cross-reference water
temperatures with your list

32:00.065 --> 32:01.560
of prior deaths in the area.

32:01.561 --> 32:03.862
This lake means something
to him other than cold water.

32:03.930 --> 32:06.219
If he died once before,
there should be a report

32:06.220 --> 32:08.067
about it or another trauma
that keeps him rooted here.

32:08.068 --> 32:09.568
We both thought that he could be
a first responder

32:09.619 --> 32:10.819
or knows the area well,

32:10.904 --> 32:12.655
so cross with your list
of local law enforcement

32:12.739 --> 32:14.490
and park officials.

32:14.574 --> 32:15.874
Oh, God.

32:15.942 --> 32:19.779
Daniel Whitaker was murdered
15 years ago. He was a park attendant.

32:19.780 --> 32:22.071
His dock was in the coldest
part of Ridge Canyon Lake.

32:22.403 --> 32:23.561
Who killed him, Garcia?

32:23.670 --> 32:24.914
His son, Chase.

32:24.915 --> 32:26.383
Daniel physically
assaulted his son

32:26.434 --> 32:28.552
and then buried him alive
when he was 16.

32:28.603 --> 32:31.471
There was no mom in the picture.
Chase got off light.

32:31.556 --> 32:33.023
He got out at 18.

32:33.090 --> 32:34.391
Garcia, check
his medical history.

32:34.442 --> 32:35.892
Um...

32:35.943 --> 32:39.613
Oh. Oh, Chase was diagnosed
with lymphoma when he was 10.

32:39.697 --> 32:41.815
It went into remission when he
was 12, but a few months ago

32:41.883 --> 32:44.284
he was diagnosed with stage 4 and
he's been given 3 months to live.

32:44.369 --> 32:46.119
The idea of having
to face death again

32:46.204 --> 32:48.538
must be what sent him
over the edge.

32:48.606 --> 32:49.813
The guy's been haunted
his whole life by whatever

32:49.838 --> 32:51.038
he experienced that night.

32:51.275 --> 32:53.577
Send us
the address, Garcia.

32:58.216 --> 33:00.317
Uhh!

33:34.202 --> 33:36.002
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch!

33:56.190 --> 33:57.507
Help!

34:19.464 --> 34:22.232
On the dock!

34:22.300 --> 34:23.867
I need a medic!

34:35.563 --> 34:37.347
Help!

34:41.351 --> 34:43.437
Ohh! Uhh!

35:04.041 --> 35:05.308
Help!

35:05.376 --> 35:06.626
Let go of me!

35:06.711 --> 35:09.379
Chase Whitaker! FBI!

35:09.430 --> 35:10.630
Stay back.

35:11.749 --> 35:13.884
- Let him go.
- I can't.

35:13.935 --> 35:16.803
You hurt him, you won't
be alive long enough

35:16.888 --> 35:18.254
to know
what he has to say.

35:18.306 --> 35:19.806
I need answers.

35:19.874 --> 35:21.808
There are no answers,
Chase.

35:21.893 --> 35:23.360
Nobody gets to know
what happens when we die.

35:23.427 --> 35:24.761
That's why
people have faith.

35:24.812 --> 35:28.982
Faith in what? My life has been
one nightmare after another.

35:29.066 --> 35:31.601
What happened to you
as a boy wasn't fair.

35:31.652 --> 35:32.903
But neither is this.

35:32.954 --> 35:34.604
Let him go.

36:06.070 --> 36:08.855
Chase...

36:08.940 --> 36:12.442
Chase...Chase...Chase...

36:12.510 --> 36:15.896
Chase...Chase...Chase...

36:18.148 --> 36:21.317
Aah!

36:40.004 --> 36:42.022
Hello, Dad.

36:53.350 --> 36:55.685
It's not your time, Chase.

36:55.736 --> 36:57.454
It's not your time, Chase.

36:57.521 --> 37:00.323
Aah!

37:03.027 --> 37:05.829
It's not your time, Chase.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.047
You're under arrest.

37:08.215 --> 37:09.499
No.

37:09.550 --> 37:11.318
No.

37:20.711 --> 37:22.729
Mom?

37:39.864 --> 37:43.116
"The timing of death,
like the ending of a story,

37:43.200 --> 37:45.919
gives a changed meaning
to what preceded it."

37:46.003 --> 37:48.288
Mary Catherine Bateson.

37:50.841 --> 37:52.509
Mm.

38:03.888 --> 38:05.522
You look like hell.

38:06.724 --> 38:08.942
You want to talk about it?

38:09.944 --> 38:11.945
Not really.

38:17.451 --> 38:19.536
You can't save everyone,
David.

38:19.603 --> 38:21.738
You know that.

38:24.075 --> 38:26.660
I lost you once.

38:26.744 --> 38:29.245
I don't want
to lose you again.

38:36.754 --> 38:39.622
You have to let me go.

38:39.674 --> 38:42.092
I can't.

38:42.143 --> 38:44.293
Life is worth fighting for.

38:44.345 --> 38:46.429
Fight how?

38:46.480 --> 38:48.464
Fighting for what?

38:48.516 --> 38:51.768
For what?

38:51.819 --> 38:53.987
Look at me.

38:55.439 --> 38:58.942
Pretty soon I'm not even gonna
be able to walk.

38:58.993 --> 39:03.780
I want to go out
as I am,

39:03.831 --> 39:08.001
as I've lived, not who I'm going
to become.

39:10.788 --> 39:13.123
I can't help you.

39:13.174 --> 39:15.759
What you're asking,

39:15.826 --> 39:18.678
I can't.

39:20.881 --> 39:23.133
I know.

39:23.184 --> 39:25.351
I knew
you never could.

39:30.057 --> 39:33.009
You spout all that
profiling talk,

39:33.060 --> 39:35.729
but, really, the best way to
get to know someone

39:35.813 --> 39:37.363
is to marry them.

39:37.448 --> 39:43.286
You are the best man

39:43.353 --> 39:46.456
I've ever known.

39:46.523 --> 39:50.359
That's why I wanted you
to be with me tonight.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.051
What have you done?

39:58.135 --> 39:59.586
Ohh. Oh, shh.

39:59.670 --> 40:02.138
Just come sit.

40:02.206 --> 40:04.007
It won't be long now.

40:04.058 --> 40:06.375
No. Don't.

40:06.427 --> 40:08.261
They won't get here
in time. Please.

40:08.345 --> 40:09.712
I have to try.

40:09.764 --> 40:11.547
No, don't!

40:11.599 --> 40:14.851
Don't.

40:14.902 --> 40:18.488
Don't let me die
in a hospital.

40:18.555 --> 40:21.557
David...

40:21.609 --> 40:24.444
Please.

40:30.117 --> 40:32.702
It's fast. It's fast.

40:32.753 --> 40:35.071
I'm already tired.

40:38.626 --> 40:40.409
Do you th--

40:40.461 --> 40:43.429
do you think
he'll be there?

40:47.084 --> 40:49.352
I know he will.

40:49.419 --> 40:50.970
Oh.
