01:08.359 --> 01:10.028
Are you all right?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.533
Sorry. My bike, it ran out of gas.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.787
It won't take me where I have to go.
But your car will.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.749
What? This was all an act
so you could steal my car?

01:22.832 --> 01:24.626
Just stay where you are.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.962
I don't like doing this. I'm sorry.
But I have a very good reason.

01:28.046 --> 01:31.090
You're not going to leave me
in the middle of nowhere, are you?

01:31.174 --> 01:33.426
Wait on the road. You're a beautiful girl.

01:33.509 --> 01:36.471
- Somebody's gonna come and pick you up.
- Thanks a lot.

04:07.078 --> 04:08.496
Hi, Sheriff.

04:11.124 --> 04:14.961
- What happened to him?
- He hit his head, knocked himself out.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.882
- This your car?
- Yes, sir.

04:23.511 --> 04:25.889
Did you know he was packing this?

04:25.972 --> 04:29.350
It looked a lot bigger
when it was pointing at me.

04:31.477 --> 04:34.355
I don't think I've seen you
round these parts before, Miss-

04:34.439 --> 04:36.232
Prince, Diana Prince.

04:36.316 --> 04:39.694
I was on my way to meet a friend
when he hijacked my car.

04:39.777 --> 04:41.738
This friend you say you're gonna meet?

04:41.821 --> 04:45.199
He's at the Red Mountain Army
Missile Range about 20 miles from here.

04:45.283 --> 04:47.493
And I'm already late, Sheriff.

04:47.785 --> 04:49.954
You're going to have to be a little later.

04:50.037 --> 04:52.957
I have you back to town
to sign a statement.

04:53.207 --> 04:55.376
- What town?
- Name of Burrogone.

04:55.459 --> 04:57.170
It's back there a ways.

04:58.921 --> 05:01.757
You can drive your own car and follow me.

05:05.553 --> 05:09.140
All right, I guess.
I just hope we don't take too long.

05:52.016 --> 05:55.144
Sheriff Beal to Home Plate.
Come in, Luther. You read me? Over.

05:55.227 --> 05:57.396
You catch up with that guy
on the motorcycle?

05:57.479 --> 05:58.689
Bringing him in now.

05:58.772 --> 06:02.568
There's some girl he tried to get
a car away from. Bringing her in, too.

06:02.651 --> 06:06.155
So tell everybody to get into their
song and dance. Over and out.

06:26.967 --> 06:29.594
Better take the car over to Ernie's
and gas up.

06:29.678 --> 06:31.888
It's the last gas station
in a hundred miles.

06:31.972 --> 06:33.557
Okay. Thanks, Sheriff.

06:33.724 --> 06:36.685
- I'll join you as soon as we lock him up.
- Okay.

06:38.895 --> 06:40.230
Thank you.

06:47.153 --> 06:48.822
Get the other end.

06:55.078 --> 06:56.413
All right.

06:56.663 --> 06:58.206
Get out of here, dog.

07:27.944 --> 07:29.654
"Mac MacDonald. "

07:32.824 --> 07:35.410
- He's coming around.
- Swell.

07:35.827 --> 07:38.663
All we need is for him to start
shooting off his mouth...

07:38.746 --> 07:40.915
while I'm getting
a statement from that girl.

07:40.999 --> 07:44.252
You want I should arrange
a terminal accident for him?

07:44.335 --> 07:46.963
No. Not unless we have to.

07:48.005 --> 07:49.966
We'll keep him on ice here.

07:51.050 --> 07:53.636
It's that girl that's got me worried.

07:56.681 --> 08:00.101
Dog, what is the matter with you?
Will you go on home?

08:13.155 --> 08:17.076
Luther, take a truck out to the highway
and pick up his cycle.

08:17.159 --> 08:19.620
I don't want it raising
any questions out there.

08:19.704 --> 08:21.330
Yes, sir, Sheriff.

08:21.914 --> 08:23.999
Something strike you funny, Luther?

08:24.083 --> 08:28.045
Yeah. Well, no. I was just thinking,
you sure do sound official.

08:28.754 --> 08:31.549
We better all sound like
what we're supposed to be...

08:31.632 --> 08:33.967
while we got a stranger in town.

08:36.178 --> 08:37.847
Yes, sir, Sheriff.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.722
Yes, sir.

09:40.325 --> 09:42.369
What's the matter
with people in this town?

09:42.452 --> 09:45.080
They act like they've never seen
a stranger before.

09:45.163 --> 09:46.331
- Stranger?
- Yeah.

09:46.414 --> 09:49.543
Sure, we get strangers
through here all the time.

09:49.793 --> 09:51.962
Anyway, six, eight times a year.

09:53.296 --> 09:56.591
Of course, they ain't all as pretty as you.

10:51.479 --> 10:52.563
Hi, Sheriff.

10:52.647 --> 10:55.608
- I can take that statement from you now.
- Good.

10:55.691 --> 10:58.778
We can do it over coffee here,
if it's all the same to you.

10:58.861 --> 11:02.073
Just so I can be on my way
as soon as possible, Sheriff.

11:02.156 --> 11:05.326
We wouldn't want to keep you here
any longer than we have to.

11:05.409 --> 11:07.620
- Would we, Ernie?
- No, sir.

11:20.633 --> 11:23.386
"Statement of Miss Diana Prince...

11:23.636 --> 11:26.347
"regards armed robbery attempt...

11:26.681 --> 11:29.725
"parenthesis, grand theft auto attempt...

11:29.934 --> 11:34.313
"parenthesis, by suspect Mac MacDonald. "

11:36.774 --> 11:40.694
Sometimes I think the pack rats carried
these off and brought them back again.

11:40.778 --> 11:44.406
- It's really getting late, and I-
- I've got to ask you one more question.

11:44.490 --> 11:47.034
You said you were gonna meet
someone at the test site?

11:47.117 --> 11:49.828
Yeah, by this time,
he probably thinks I got lost.

11:50.371 --> 11:53.582
Diana was supposed to be
there over two hours ago, Hal.

11:53.666 --> 11:55.668
Frankly, I'm worried, Steve.

11:55.751 --> 11:58.212
I called the main gate.
There's no sign of her there.

11:58.295 --> 11:59.588
Nothing on the approach road?

11:59.672 --> 12:03.258
No, sir. And the gate guard can
see 10 miles of it from his position.

12:03.342 --> 12:04.426
Keep me informed, Hal.

12:04.510 --> 12:06.595
When she does get there
give her a fast escort.

12:06.678 --> 12:08.555
I want her there for the final countdown.

12:08.639 --> 12:09.765
Right.

12:14.144 --> 12:16.188
Seating down program trajectory.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.399
Program go at 17 degrees left of six.

12:20.859 --> 12:22.569
Two degrees right of six.

12:22.945 --> 12:26.531
Program go at 17 degrees left of six.
Two degrees right of six.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.371
45-degree climb.

12:32.621 --> 12:35.332
15-degree left turn with 3-degree descent.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.169
Where's our countdown, Corporal?

12:39.753 --> 12:41.505
Minus 52 minutes, Captain.

12:47.219 --> 12:49.346
Right turn, 45 degrees.

12:49.429 --> 12:52.057
3- degree climb to the left, 12 degrees.

12:52.140 --> 12:57.020
Set air guidance to acquisition mode.
Arm warhead for impact timing.

12:57.395 --> 12:58.897
It's complete, Lieutenant.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.899
All responses A-okay.

13:00.982 --> 13:02.317
Right, Corporal.

13:02.567 --> 13:05.737
- How did it go, Andy?
- All systems are go, Captain.

13:05.904 --> 13:08.406
This baby will think
the Athena rocket to its target.

13:08.490 --> 13:09.574
Good.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.993
- Just one thing that worries me.
- What's that?

13:12.077 --> 13:13.912
There were supposed to be two of these.

13:13.995 --> 13:17.332
A spare for backup,
in case one got damaged in transit.

13:17.415 --> 13:21.461
When I came here to uncrate them
an hour ago, I found this in one crate...

13:22.379 --> 13:24.089
and this in the other one.

13:27.008 --> 13:29.260
- A regular-issue flight helmet.
- Right.

13:29.344 --> 13:31.930
So where's my backup control helmet?

13:32.597 --> 13:35.558
This better be a foul-up,
or we're in big trouble.

13:37.268 --> 13:39.229
We better find out in a hurry.

13:48.780 --> 13:51.157
I sure appreciate
your cooperation, Miss Prince.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.117
You sure I can't buy you a little lunch?

13:53.201 --> 13:56.746
No, thanks. Maybe next time
I come to Burrogone, Sheriff.

13:56.913 --> 13:58.539
Well, thanks again.

13:58.623 --> 14:01.459
Frida, whip me up a chili, size...

14:01.542 --> 14:03.419
Goodbye, Sheriff Beal.

14:07.757 --> 14:09.217
What are you doing?

14:11.135 --> 14:12.803
What are you doing to my car?

14:12.887 --> 14:15.848
By golly, this sure is your lucky day, miss.

14:16.098 --> 14:18.684
Just on a whim,
I checked under your hood...

14:18.768 --> 14:21.687
and dogged if your fuel pump
wasn't leaking.

14:21.771 --> 14:24.565
Your whole car
might've blowed up on you.

14:24.649 --> 14:28.653
Just look at this little bugger.
Look at the gasoline pour out of there.

14:28.778 --> 14:32.239
I'll have it fixed up for you
right away. No time at all.

15:33.592 --> 15:35.677
You trying to get the news?

15:38.138 --> 15:40.599
- Hi, who are you?
- I'm just George.

15:40.849 --> 15:42.267
Just George?

15:42.768 --> 15:45.937
Yes, that's what everybody
says when they see me.

15:46.021 --> 15:47.773
"That's just George. "

15:48.690 --> 15:50.942
Well, I'm just Diana, George.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.321
I'm happy to meet you, Diana George.

15:54.404 --> 15:57.282
No, I'm Diana, George.

15:58.033 --> 16:00.660
That's what said, ma'am. Diana George.

16:01.745 --> 16:03.455
Yes, that's what you said.

16:04.289 --> 16:07.042
I can't get seem to get
my car radio to work.

16:07.125 --> 16:11.046
Maybe you'll read a newspaper.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.006
Only costs a dime.

16:14.966 --> 16:17.969
But this newspaper
is three weeks old, George.

16:18.595 --> 16:21.931
That's why it costs a dime.
Cost a quarter, new.

16:24.642 --> 16:26.311
You don't want it?

16:26.978 --> 16:29.522
No, it's fine. I'll tell you what.

16:29.773 --> 16:33.151
I'll pay you full price for the newspaper...

16:34.277 --> 16:36.780
if you'll give me some information.

16:37.071 --> 16:39.824
Good, anything you want.

16:39.908 --> 16:43.328
Okay, is there a car for rent,
or a taxi service in town?

16:44.078 --> 16:46.122
No, ma'am. Nothing like that.

16:46.206 --> 16:50.460
What about a bus? There's got to be a bus
that goes through Burrogone.

16:51.169 --> 16:55.506
One came through about eight years ago.

16:56.174 --> 16:57.925
The driver was lost.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.599
What about a public telephone?

17:05.683 --> 17:08.770
Is there a public telephone
somewhere in town?

17:08.895 --> 17:12.607
Flo has one in the front room.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.525
She's our telephone operator.

17:14.608 --> 17:17.569
That is the best news
I've heard all morning.

17:18.362 --> 17:20.489
- You're a doll.
- Thank you.

17:22.825 --> 17:24.618
Flo's not home now.

17:24.702 --> 17:26.037
- She's not?
- No.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.581
She went to the store. I seen her go.

17:28.664 --> 17:31.042
She'll be back in a little while.

17:31.876 --> 17:34.545
I can't even call Hal
to send someone to pick me up.

17:34.628 --> 17:35.755
That's great.

17:35.838 --> 17:39.717
I get the feeling that there's something
very strange going on in this town.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.386
- I gotta go now.
- Wait!

18:12.166 --> 18:15.044
Nice doggy. Friendly doggy.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.592
Get out of the way.

18:38.442 --> 18:40.110
Sheriff, we're asking for trouble...

18:40.193 --> 18:43.196
if we don't get rid of that
woman before she gets wise.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.366
Okay, hero. Do you want
to be the one to do it?

18:47.367 --> 18:49.786
Why don't we give the job to Flo?

18:51.121 --> 18:52.664
Not a bad idea.

18:53.707 --> 18:57.210
- You want me to check on her, boss?
- No, I'll do that.

18:58.628 --> 19:00.297
What do you know?

19:00.964 --> 19:03.842
You reckon that prisoner
we got in the cell there?

19:04.259 --> 19:07.762
Seems he got into a little misdemeanor
mischief a couple years back.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.973
Halloween mischief on a motorcycle.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.310
- Something else.
- What?

19:13.393 --> 19:16.396
- You'll never guess who his uncle is.
- Who?

19:17.314 --> 19:19.566
The sheriff of Burrogone.

19:33.997 --> 19:36.416
Been looking at your dossier here, Mac.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.711
Seems as though you is a regular jailbird,
ain't you?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.173
That's right. You sleep it off.

19:43.756 --> 19:46.801
The more you don't see,
the longer you stay alive.

19:51.347 --> 19:53.474
What're you doing in there?

19:57.979 --> 19:59.355
Come on back out.

20:08.656 --> 20:09.949
Oh, no!

20:11.617 --> 20:14.620
Sheriff, he's escaped.

22:04.187 --> 22:05.355
No!

23:00.868 --> 23:02.996
Just come on in. It's open.

23:05.873 --> 23:08.418
Well, I am speaking up, Mrs. Merkle.

23:08.543 --> 23:11.254
Have a seat. I'll be with you in a minute.

23:11.337 --> 23:13.548
I'm shouting myself hoarse.

23:13.881 --> 23:17.051
There's just too much noise
on the line today. That's all.

23:17.135 --> 23:19.762
But they're working on it.
It'll be cleared up soon.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.472
It's Mrs. Merkle.

23:21.973 --> 23:23.558
Yes, all right.

23:54.130 --> 23:56.424
That prisoner, Mac, he's escaped.

23:56.715 --> 23:59.593
I want you all to keep
your eyes peeled for him.

23:59.677 --> 24:04.140
Incidentally, one of you two jokers
is going to have to pay for a new vehicle...

24:04.223 --> 24:06.433
out of your share of the take.

24:07.351 --> 24:08.435
How they coming?

24:08.519 --> 24:12.273
Be a while, looks like. They still
don't have the rocket in firing position.

24:12.356 --> 24:13.440
Sing out when they do.

24:13.524 --> 24:15.776
- Is that walkie-talkie working?
- Yeah.

24:17.278 --> 24:21.198
All right, Mrs. Merkle.
My best to Fred, too.

24:21.865 --> 24:24.368
Maybe later we can
hear each other better.

24:26.954 --> 24:30.374
- Hello, dearie. My name's Flo.
- Nice to meet you, Flo.

24:30.457 --> 24:33.752
- Is there something I can do for you?
- Yes, there is.

24:33.836 --> 24:36.630
I want to make a call
to the military testing grounds.

24:36.713 --> 24:39.883
- About 30 miles from here.
- I know where it is, all right.

24:39.967 --> 24:42.344
The trouble is there's
so much line noise today.

24:42.427 --> 24:45.848
I don't know what it is.
Maybe sunspots or something.

24:48.934 --> 24:52.980
You might do better if you plugged it
into the outgoing instead of the incoming.

24:53.063 --> 24:55.107
Mercy sakes, you're right.

24:55.315 --> 24:58.610
You'd think after 25 years,
I'd get the hang of this thing.

24:59.486 --> 25:00.654
May I?

25:01.321 --> 25:02.864
Well, sure.

25:04.324 --> 25:05.492
Bad enough here in town.

25:05.575 --> 25:09.162
Out on the trunk line out to
the testing grounds, there's no way.

25:09.871 --> 25:13.041
That's the same static
I heard on the car radio this morning.

25:16.211 --> 25:18.296
A person might get the idea...

25:18.380 --> 25:21.675
someone was jamming communications
in and out of Burrogone.

25:23.093 --> 25:24.636
You mean commies?

25:33.103 --> 25:34.813
You hold it right there!

25:39.067 --> 25:40.235
Hold it!

25:51.246 --> 25:53.915
Mac, you come on back here right now!

25:54.749 --> 25:56.417
Say please, Luther.

25:56.501 --> 25:58.837
- Now go after him.
- Yes, Sheriff.

26:06.469 --> 26:09.681
It's so lovely you could
join me for a cup of tea.

26:10.098 --> 26:12.058
There's one thing about Burrogone.

26:12.141 --> 26:15.687
It's not much of a town, but we do
try to make folks feel welcome.

26:15.770 --> 26:19.148
I bet you never heard of this town
before today, did you, dearie?

26:19.232 --> 26:20.983
Actually, I did.

26:21.067 --> 26:23.403
I remember reading
an article a while back...

26:23.486 --> 26:25.947
about colorful western place names.

26:26.364 --> 26:28.950
Burrogone, do you know
what the name means?

26:29.033 --> 26:31.994
Why, goodness, no, child. It's just a name.

26:32.078 --> 26:34.080
It doesn't mean anything.

26:35.164 --> 26:36.707
I suppose not.

26:37.208 --> 26:40.962
- Do you take anything in yours?
- No, thanks, Flo, nothing in mine.

26:41.045 --> 26:43.756
Well, here you are.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.175
Now, you drink this.

26:46.259 --> 26:48.928
I could tell you were
all tensed up about something.

26:49.011 --> 26:50.805
Now, I'll get mine.

27:11.325 --> 27:15.329
Now, here we are. Isn't this lovely?
Having a little tea party.

27:16.664 --> 27:17.873
I'm so sorry.

27:17.957 --> 27:21.293
I'm clumsy today for some reason.
Everything that's been happening-

27:21.377 --> 27:24.838
No trouble at all.
I'll just get a towel to mop that up.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.716
There's plenty of water for another cup.

27:33.430 --> 27:34.973
Here we are.

27:50.697 --> 27:54.868
I goofed. Had it all set up
and she walked out.

27:58.080 --> 28:02.042
Lady, listen. I don't know your name,
but you have to trust me.

28:05.629 --> 28:07.964
Trust you? I can't even see you.

28:09.007 --> 28:13.637
And if you are who I think you are,
you pulled a gun on me.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.848
If it hadn't been for Wonder Woman,
you would've stolen my car.

28:16.932 --> 28:19.392
I understand that you travel
in the best of company.

28:19.476 --> 28:23.021
I still thought you were one of them.
Lady, you've got to trust me.

28:23.104 --> 28:26.316
I heard them plan it with Flo
for her to kill you.

28:27.317 --> 28:30.737
Okay, you don't believe me?
Go inside and have a cup of tea.

28:30.820 --> 28:31.905
Okay.

28:33.573 --> 28:36.618
- Where do we talk?
- Turn to your right.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.162
There's a freight depot.

29:01.476 --> 29:03.269
I'm sorry.

29:04.229 --> 29:07.315
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't followed.

29:07.899 --> 29:10.860
- Who are you?
- Mac MacDonald.

29:10.944 --> 29:12.070
Okay.

29:12.153 --> 29:15.156
One time citizen of Burrogone.
Born of a real citizen.

29:15.239 --> 29:19.452
They put you in the jail.
How did you get out, Mac MacDonald?

29:19.744 --> 29:21.496
My uncle is the sheriff of this town.

29:21.579 --> 29:25.208
When I was 13, Jailbreak Willie
taught me how to bust out of jail.

29:25.291 --> 29:28.795
I was just passing through town,
I figured I'd say hello to Uncle Bert.

29:28.878 --> 29:33.800
I get into town, and nobody
is who they're supposed to be.

29:34.634 --> 29:36.010
Especially Uncle Bert.

29:36.093 --> 29:40.139
If Flo or Ernie are any indication,
I'd say they're all imposters.

29:40.473 --> 29:42.642
- Am I right?
- Every last one of them.

29:42.725 --> 29:44.435
I want to show you something.

30:02.995 --> 30:05.831
- Today's the 14th, right?
- That's right.

30:06.665 --> 30:08.501
There's nobody in town.

30:09.168 --> 30:13.255
All right. But we still don't know who
these people are or what they're up to.

30:13.339 --> 30:15.508
No, the only obvious
thing they've done is...

30:15.591 --> 30:17.259
they've set up a portable generator.

30:17.343 --> 30:19.929
They've put it inside the barn
at the end of town.

30:20.012 --> 30:22.139
Yes, I have seen that building.

30:27.686 --> 30:30.356
Okay, then it's your turn to trust me.

30:31.565 --> 30:32.775
Okay?

30:34.360 --> 30:37.029
I think it's part of a plan
to steal an army missile...

30:37.112 --> 30:41.158
being tested in about an hour
in the Red Mountain Missile Range.

30:41.241 --> 30:43.118
What's our next move?

30:43.202 --> 30:47.081
Your next move is to do whatever
you have to, to get out of town.

30:47.498 --> 30:50.542
Go to Capt. Hal Shaver
at the Red Mountain Test Area.

30:50.626 --> 30:52.503
Tell him to abort the Athena flight.

30:52.586 --> 30:54.880
What about you? You gonna be okay?

30:54.963 --> 30:59.009
I'm gonna do everything I can to put
that generator out of commission.

30:59.134 --> 31:00.969
Go on, and be careful.

31:14.274 --> 31:15.609
These are five of them, Bill.

31:15.692 --> 31:17.736
You've been on the project
since it started.

31:17.819 --> 31:19.696
- Any of them look familiar?
- Who are they?

31:19.780 --> 31:24.117
These are men who've left the project
or been fired as potential security risks.

31:29.789 --> 31:32.417
Sorry, none of them ring a bell.

31:33.251 --> 31:34.628
Excuse me.

31:36.755 --> 31:39.841
Trevor. Yeah, put him through.
It's Hal Shaver.

31:41.301 --> 31:43.637
Hal, I've got five prime suspects here.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.556
Any one of them could've taken
the missing control helmet.

31:46.640 --> 31:50.643
There's not much we can do
about it now, Steve. Except maybe pray.

31:50.727 --> 31:53.772
We're eight minutes
and counting from launch.

31:54.689 --> 31:56.733
- Any sign of Diana?
- None.

31:56.816 --> 31:58.902
Looks like she's going
to miss the excitement.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.154
Keep me posted. I'll be here.

32:37.940 --> 32:40.485
- Any problems?
- No, it's been quiet.

32:41.277 --> 32:45.281
Some of us are getting pretty tired
of all this dumb play-acting.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.325
When do we see some loot out of all this?

32:47.408 --> 32:50.494
You've already seen some
pretty good loot up front.

32:50.578 --> 32:53.873
- The payoff isn't far away now.
- It better be worth it.

33:16.020 --> 33:18.397
Hold it right there, little lady.

33:19.064 --> 33:23.277
The dummy here tells me you saved
him from being run over by the jeep.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.488
Now maybe you'd like to save him
from having his head ventilated?

33:26.572 --> 33:30.701
Nothing tells me that he isn't one of you.
Everybody else is.

33:30.868 --> 33:32.286
Want to bet?

33:32.786 --> 33:35.664
Of course, you don't have as much to lose
as George has.

33:35.748 --> 33:38.375
Please, don't let him do it.

33:39.001 --> 33:41.545
All right. What do you want me to do?

33:41.628 --> 33:45.591
Just let me lock you up somewhere
till we're done with what we're doing.

33:45.674 --> 33:48.385
Why lock me up? Why don't I just leave?

33:48.719 --> 33:50.304
- Leave?
- Yeah.

33:51.096 --> 33:52.389
Fly away.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.391
Like this.

34:10.908 --> 34:14.119
Bad man. Not even the real sheriff.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.422
And I'm not the real, real George.

34:25.839 --> 34:28.884
Straight in the face,
this stuff will stop a herd of elephants.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.511
- Is she dead?
- I doubt it.

34:31.594 --> 34:33.889
But she can't bother us anymore.

34:34.264 --> 34:35.806
Where's Ernie?

34:37.766 --> 34:40.812
Help!

34:47.652 --> 34:49.237
Get that idiot down.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.739
I want everybody in the street
in two minutes flat.

34:51.822 --> 34:53.074
Let's move it.

34:53.658 --> 34:57.203
Five, four, three, two...

34:57.495 --> 34:59.414
...one, zero.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.919
We are in flight. All systems go.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.464
All systems go.

35:08.214 --> 35:11.676
Proceeding now with
program trajectory number one.

35:11.759 --> 35:15.555
Proceeding as programmed.
First program systems A-okay.

35:15.638 --> 35:19.684
Program secure,
degrees nine through six. Repeat.

35:30.403 --> 35:33.614
Level 5, 45 degrees.

35:37.452 --> 35:38.536
Attention.

35:38.745 --> 35:40.913
Athena rocket has completed 90 percent...

35:40.997 --> 35:43.374
of its required maneuvers
on its "A" program.

35:50.631 --> 35:53.509
Now bring it back
and we'll try the "B" run.

35:59.223 --> 36:02.393
Commencing 45 degrees
as set for "B" run.

36:02.476 --> 36:05.896
15 degrees left turn
with maximum acceleration.

36:07.023 --> 36:11.277
Repeat. 15 degrees left turn.

36:13.612 --> 36:16.490
- What're you doing?
- It's getting away from me.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.539
Rocket now in unprogrammed
yaw to right.

36:23.622 --> 36:28.002
Unprogrammed yaw completed.
32 degrees minimal trajectory.

36:28.252 --> 36:30.921
Missile now violating test range facility.

36:31.046 --> 36:34.091
- Are we still transmitting?
- Yes, sir, we're wide open.

36:35.926 --> 36:37.177
Captain.

36:38.596 --> 36:41.599
I'm picking up a transmission
beamed our way.

36:42.182 --> 36:46.603
- Is it capable of interfering with ours?
- Yes, sir, it is.

37:00.951 --> 37:03.954
Captain, I can't control it.
It's not responding!

37:04.037 --> 37:05.998
Don't knock yourself out, Andy.

37:06.081 --> 37:08.709
It's the other control helmet.
We've found it.

37:08.792 --> 37:10.419
Get a bearing on its new course.

37:10.502 --> 37:13.797
MPs and security people, saddle up,
we're going after it!

37:19.386 --> 37:20.470
Who are you?

37:20.554 --> 37:21.888
- Are you Shaver?
- Yeah.

37:21.972 --> 37:26.143
I have a message for you from
a Diana Prince to abort Athena flight.

37:27.477 --> 37:29.896
- Don't tell me I'm too late.
- We'll see about that!

37:29.980 --> 37:31.648
Everybody, let's go!

37:44.578 --> 37:46.162
There it is. I see it.

37:56.506 --> 37:57.882
Bull's-eye!

37:58.883 --> 38:00.010
He did it!

38:00.093 --> 38:01.386
Don't touch it!

38:09.352 --> 38:11.938
It works!

38:14.983 --> 38:17.986
Don't you have that other
important item, Sheriff?

38:18.069 --> 38:20.905
Sure thing. Got it all ready
over in the sheriff's office.

38:20.989 --> 38:22.979
Don't you think it
calls for a celebration?

38:23.014 --> 38:24.367
Yes, sir.

38:25.201 --> 38:29.581
Okay, everybody, let's go back to the jail.
We've got a party going on.

38:37.422 --> 38:40.425
Sir, the missile's landed.
30 miles south of here.

38:40.508 --> 38:43.678
Right. We'll see how fast
we can travel 30 miles.

39:11.664 --> 39:15.793
Aren't you going to have a drink?
This stuff packs an awful wallop.

39:17.128 --> 39:19.588
More of a wallop than you think, Sheriff.

39:26.053 --> 39:27.930
Why, you...

39:39.733 --> 39:43.779
See, my friends, I'm not really
very much of a sharing person.

39:44.154 --> 39:48.450
Besides, you would've all been
too greedy to wait for the big payoff.

39:49.159 --> 39:54.039
A million dollars cash sale is nothing.
You understand that, Wonder Woman?

39:56.625 --> 39:59.795
As soon as I build a few
more of these helmets...

40:00.462 --> 40:03.215
I'll hold the whole country for ransom.

40:04.383 --> 40:07.553
The military, the airlines...

40:07.970 --> 40:12.474
they'll all have to pay if they want
their planes to fly unmolested.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.936
You see...

40:17.813 --> 40:20.941
there's no defense against
a thought-controlled missile.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.132
Follow me.

43:09.817 --> 43:11.193
There he is now.

46:02.655 --> 46:04.198
It was all perfect.

46:04.281 --> 46:07.451
Everything planned, step by step,
and you had to show up.

46:07.534 --> 46:10.829
Well, there are some things
you just can't count on.

46:11.914 --> 46:13.540
Come on, George.

46:16.335 --> 46:18.128
All right, let's go.

46:18.879 --> 46:20.297
Load them up.

46:25.219 --> 46:27.846
- Genius, huh?
- Get him aboard.

46:29.473 --> 46:31.433
Well, there it is, Steve.

46:31.516 --> 46:33.602
The IADC owes a big vote of thanks...

46:33.685 --> 46:36.480
to a young man
by the name of Mac MacDonald.

46:37.230 --> 46:39.232
I'll see to it that he gets a commendation.

46:39.566 --> 46:41.401
They wanna give you a medal.

46:42.277 --> 46:43.653
Oh, by the way...

46:43.945 --> 46:46.823
I found out that your friend,
George is a Dr. Wunderley.

46:46.907 --> 46:48.992
He was fired off
the project two months ago...

46:49.076 --> 46:51.995
when he was found playing
footsies with a foreign government.

46:52.079 --> 46:56.833
He's a very dangerous man, Steve.
I hope they lock him up for a long time.

46:57.334 --> 46:59.544
I think you can count on that, Diana.

46:59.628 --> 47:01.421
- So long, now.
- Okay, bye.

47:08.428 --> 47:09.512
Hal.

47:10.513 --> 47:14.351
I should've known that these people
weren't the real residents of Burrogone...

47:14.434 --> 47:17.979
when old Flo gave it away.
She didn't know what the name meant.

47:18.063 --> 47:21.775
- Burrogone? What does it mean?
- Why don't you tell him, Mac?

47:22.400 --> 47:26.780
I'll tell him the story if you promise
to have lunch with me tomorrow.

47:26.863 --> 47:27.989
Okay.

47:28.073 --> 47:30.492
The story goes that there was
this old prospector...

47:30.575 --> 47:34.204
he came into town and met these Indians.
He taught them how to play poker.

47:34.287 --> 47:35.955
Except that he taught them so well...

47:36.039 --> 47:38.791
that he lost everything he owned,
except for his mule.

47:38.875 --> 47:41.628
So he takes his mule
and puts it in the last pot.

47:41.711 --> 47:44.881
- And?
- That's what Burrogone means.

47:44.964 --> 47:49.636
This is the town that he lost his...
jackass in.
