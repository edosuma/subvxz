WEBVTT

00:37.496 --> 00:39.498
Before it happened,

00:39.498 --> 00:42.334
no one would have believed that
our world was being watched.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.219
Watched keenly and closely

00:52.219 --> 00:54.680
by intelligences
far greater than us.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.728
Scrutinizing us

01:01.728 --> 01:04.314
as we do cells
under a microscope,

01:15.826 --> 01:19.246
and yet,
across the gulf of space,

01:19.246 --> 01:22.916
an enemy regarded this earth
with their envious eyes.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.629
And slowly and surely,

01:27.629 --> 01:29.881
drew their plans against us.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.467
Whoa.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.801
-Sorry.
-A little warning.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.971
Well?

02:22.934 --> 02:24.436
We're on course.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.230
This way.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.819
When did you see it, Hannah?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.447
About two hours ago,

02:35.447 --> 02:36.990
just a green light

02:36.990 --> 02:39.618
-passing through the sky.
-Green?

02:39.618 --> 02:41.870
Aren't meteors
supposed to be white or yellow?

02:41.870 --> 02:43.413
Maybe it's the aliens.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.123
I think I believe
Dr. Stint, Ogilvy.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.541
We're certainly
not alone in this universe.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.834
Dr. Stint.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.586
Why don't you believe her?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.213
All right. Look.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.298
I respect some of her work,

02:53.298 --> 02:55.217
but truthfully speaking,

02:55.217 --> 02:57.928
she has a lot
of crackpot ideas and--

02:57.928 --> 03:00.180
Dr. Stint is a leading
astronomer in England,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.515
and we're lucky
to have her at UCL.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.891
We are lucky to have her at UCL.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.184
Oh, shut up.
You're such a child.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.311
Guys. Let's not waste time.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.354
Let's keep going.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.315
Oh, finger.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.650
-Oh, shut up.
-My feelings.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.818
Uh-huh.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.489
Not far now.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.698
Thank Christ for that.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.991
My legs are dead.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.795
We have made it
through the woods, boys.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.338
I'll tell you in five minutes

03:33.338 --> 03:34.714
if I've made it through
the woods or not.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.882
Wait. Where's Herb?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.427
What? Right behind us.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.595
-Herb?
-Come on.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.973
-Herb!
-Herbert.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.142
-Herb!
-Herby!

04:26.641 --> 04:27.768
What?

04:29.478 --> 04:32.731
Ogi!

04:32.731 --> 04:34.983
Jesus! You scared
the life out of me.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.401
What on Earth
are you doing here?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.987
I thought I saw a...

04:38.987 --> 04:40.697
Come on, let's go.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.909
All right.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.290
Sorry, guys.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.750
You all right there, buddy?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.126
You know what?

04:57.047 --> 04:58.507
I think I've got
a theory about this.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.050
Oh, here we go. Here we go.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.468
-No, I have--
-We've got a theory again.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.469
Where's the camera?
Bring it out.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.637
Yes. Have to get this.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.638
At this time, I have to say it.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.805
For posterity.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.307
Okay.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.558
Go.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.768
Okay. What I'm saying is

05:09.768 --> 05:11.603
hypothetically,

05:11.603 --> 05:13.230
what if Martians exist?

05:13.230 --> 05:16.399
Okay.
So whatever I saw tonight

05:16.399 --> 05:17.692
definitely wasn't a meteor.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.194
Exactly, exactly,

05:19.194 --> 05:20.862
exactly, it wasn't a meteor,
was it?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.405
So what could it have been?

05:22.405 --> 05:24.741
It could have been
a probe, a rocket.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.284
We could be dealing
with a Martian invasion.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.702
All right. Okay,

05:27.702 --> 05:30.789
just calm down,
tin foil hat man.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.875
Herbert, I love you.

05:33.875 --> 05:38.547
But if life on Mars
even existed,

05:38.547 --> 05:40.840
it's long extinct.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.510
Mars is just
a big dusty graveyard.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.303
We'll see, Ogi.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.681
We will see.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.140
Well, you tried
to teach these kids.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.184
Try to raise them right.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.353
Unbelievable.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.448
Whoa.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.367
Would you stop doing that?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.494
-What is wrong?
-GPS is dead.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.123
Might as well call it a night.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.583
But we're so close.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.626
It's pitch black,
navigation is gone,

06:16.626 --> 06:18.503
could be anywhere
within two-mile radius.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.754
Fine.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.464
We can stay at my mom's.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.882
She doesn't live far from here.

06:22.882 --> 06:23.883
We'll start early
in the morning.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.010
Oh, stay at yours.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.595
Relax. I'll be there too.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.305
Oh, now you're making it
sound worse.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.849
Look, we can charge
your GPS and start early.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.309
Let's just go, yes?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.271
Hey. Coming.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.374
Good morning, everyone.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.586
It is nine o'clock
on 17th October.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.504
And we were supposed to be

07:01.504 --> 07:04.174
the early bird
catching our meteor

07:04.174 --> 07:07.010
but our super,

07:07.010 --> 07:10.472
super enthusiastic astronomer

07:10.472 --> 07:12.349
is still asleep. Nice close up.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.100
Very nice, very nice.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.935
-Now, Herb.
-Yes?

07:15.935 --> 07:18.855
-Would you please do the honors?
-Of course.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.317
Asshole!

07:26.905 --> 07:29.282
Yeah, I'm letting you get away
with this this time.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.492
Yeah, all right.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.165
God, Hannah, stop being weird.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.209
This is for documenting
our work, yeah?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.419
Not for silly pranks.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.339
Herbert, are you coming?

07:44.339 --> 07:45.924
Yeah, I'm here.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.258
Morning, sweetie.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.593
Morning.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.803
Did you sleep well?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.221
Yeah, fine.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.223
Are you guys
off out again today?

07:53.223 --> 07:56.726
Uh, yeah, hopefully,
find something interesting.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.687
And what time do you think
you'll be home?

07:58.687 --> 08:00.355
Uh, I don't know.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.023
It depends on what we get up to.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.400
Well, I'm going to
Leatherhead this afternoon

08:03.400 --> 08:05.026
to see your Uncle Tom.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.612
-Okay.
-You sure to make it, won't you?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.823
I'll try.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.283
-What do you mean you'll try?
-I mean I'll try.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.160
Your Uncle Tom's done a lot
for us since your dad--

08:14.160 --> 08:15.870
Mom, leave it.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.707
Look, it's not far to cycle

08:18.707 --> 08:21.209
or you can catch a bus
and meet me there.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.087
Yeah. Just leave it, okay?

08:24.087 --> 08:25.714
-I'll try and make it.
-Your dad and Tom

08:25.714 --> 08:27.632
had the same passions
that you've got now.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.217
And Tom might be
the closest connection

08:29.217 --> 08:31.302
-you've got to your father.
-Mom,

08:31.302 --> 08:32.846
the only connection
I had with dad
was that bloody telescope.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.847
Just leave it, okay?

08:33.847 --> 08:34.848
Herbert.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.890
Herbert, listen!

08:40.854 --> 08:42.522
Hey, Ellie.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.274
Morning, gorgeous.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.483
How have you been?

08:45.483 --> 08:46.693
Good, thanks.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.986
Busy with work.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.072
Great.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.160
You made pancakes.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.871
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
sit down and get them

08:57.871 --> 08:59.205
before they get cold.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.875
Where's Ogilvy?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.209
He's in the bathroom.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.211
Okay.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.882
I'll get Herbert.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.010
Thanks, Hannah.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.770
Hey.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.733
So, here you are.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.576
What's that?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.203
It's a walkie-talkie.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.415
Is it your dad's?

09:46.002 --> 09:48.463
Yeah.

09:48.463 --> 09:53.635
He used to love everything
sort of radios and signals.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.806
We used to just, sort of,

09:57.806 --> 09:59.974
listen to random frequencies

09:59.974 --> 10:02.644
and he always used to brag

10:02.644 --> 10:04.270
that we might come across
some Russian spies

10:04.270 --> 10:06.439
up to no good or something.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.441
Hey, guys.
Should we get breakfast?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.987
Jesus. This is older
than my grandma

10:12.987 --> 10:14.489
and your grandma too.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.366
I don't know why
people still use these.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.493
Why not?

10:18.493 --> 10:20.787
It's so outdated and bulky,

10:20.787 --> 10:22.413
and it's got limited range,

10:22.413 --> 10:24.332
and it's not even accurate.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.918
Listen, it's all about 5G now.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.420
-6G will be next.
-If your brain isn't fried

10:29.420 --> 10:31.297
-with all that radiation.
-Uh-hmm. Really?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.007
-Uh-hmm.
-All right.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.092
Put your phone away.
Let's see how long you last.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.760
Whatever.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.013
All right.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.224
I'm gonna go eat some pancakes.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.226
You can come if you like.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.747
By the way, um,
did you guys

11:04.747 --> 11:06.165
blow an air horn this morning?

11:07.709 --> 11:09.752
What are you giggling about?

11:09.752 --> 11:12.422
They're being immature,
Mrs. Wells.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.090
You winding him up again.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.925
It's jealousy, Mrs. Wells.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.635
You know what? I just think

11:17.635 --> 11:19.053
they just can't handle the fact

11:19.053 --> 11:20.805
that I'm
the superior astronomer.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.557
-You are so modest.
-I know.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.767
So how's the research
coming along then, Ogilvy?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.769
Not bad. In fact, very soon,

11:26.769 --> 11:28.646
you should see our names
in the news

11:28.646 --> 11:30.940
for some very important
astronomical event.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.693
Hmm, that reminds me

11:33.693 --> 11:36.571
of something that I heard
in the radio this morning.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.281
What did you hear on the radio?

11:38.281 --> 11:40.992
Something about a meteor
landing at Horsell Common.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.660
What? When?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.787
This morning.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.959
What the hell?

11:51.753 --> 11:53.504
We're already too late.
What's the point?

11:53.504 --> 11:55.340
Just ride!

11:55.340 --> 11:57.050
The only thing
that matters is that

11:57.050 --> 11:59.218
we're the first people
to investigate the impact.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.054
Let's just hope
it's not what we think it is.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.555
What you think it is.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.806
I doubt it's ground zero

12:03.806 --> 12:05.308
of an alien invasion, Herbert.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.476
We'll see.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.685
All right.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.031
Come on, hurry up.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.166
So, we're a little bit late
to be the first ones here.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.918
Let's get some fun.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.878
So much for being
the early bird, guys.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.922
Excuse me.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.343
Whoa.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.431
So...

12:47.600 --> 12:50.395
meteorite?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.813
It's big, isn't it?

12:51.813 --> 12:52.939
It's got to be
at least...

12:52.939 --> 12:54.732
50, 60 feet wide.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.823
We should get close to that.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.783
Yeah.
I don't know if you notice,

13:03.783 --> 13:05.243
but there's police everywhere.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.452
We'll go on the back.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.997
Follow me.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.895
All right, guys.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.064
I need this whole area,
get them out.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.483
Nobody, and I mean,
nobody can come down there.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.193
-Is that understood?
-Yes, sergeant.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.903
Okay. Thank you very much.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.197
Get down.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.991
Sergeant. Sergeant

13:46.409 --> 13:48.327
Okay. Thank you.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.065
Looks clear.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.819
Whoa.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.037
What is this?

14:33.831 --> 14:35.583
It's like a heat
coming off in it.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.884
Shh.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.511
It's cooler down here
near the impact.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.473
Ogi, have you got that torch?

14:50.473 --> 14:53.392
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.686
Well, it's definitely
not a meteorite.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.939
-How do you know that?
-Look at the shape of it.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.482
It's all wrong. I mean,

14:59.482 --> 15:01.275
it looks like it's metal.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.845
Holy.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.096
What is that?

15:32.890 --> 15:35.476
Oh, my God.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.357
We should go.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.234
For once,
I agree with you, Hannah.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.163
Herb!

15:58.666 --> 16:01.294
Herbert! Herb!

16:01.294 --> 16:04.463
-Herbert, let's go.
-Yeah, sorry.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.299
What are you doing down there?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.593
Get up here right now!

16:08.593 --> 16:11.012
Quick!

16:11.012 --> 16:13.306
You guys better have
a bloody good reason

16:13.306 --> 16:15.975
as to why I shouldn't have
you guys arrested right now.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.977
What are you doing here?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.854
We're from UCL.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.481
Dr. Stint sent us to start
investigating the meteorite.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.317
This is a restricted area.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.485
Dr. Stint will be coming
herself to investigate.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.238
There's no way
she'll send a bunch of kids.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.699
Follow me, now.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.825
Kids?

16:35.369 --> 16:36.913
You all right, Herb?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.372
Yeah, I'm okay.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.499
Just thinking about what it was.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.294
I'm just wondering if we should
tell him what we saw.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.004
Tell me--tell me what?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.172
What did you see?

16:48.674 --> 16:49.717
Well?

16:51.469 --> 16:53.888
It was like an octopus
shrouded in black smoke.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.266
An octopus?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.935
Yeah.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.061
Stay there.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.979
Don't move.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.943
Well, congratulations, Herb.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.361
You were right.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.572
It feels great, Ogi,
really does.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.366
So, why do we think
that they're here?

17:13.366 --> 17:14.909
How would I know?

17:14.909 --> 17:16.160
To have tea
with his mom or something.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.162
Okay.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.039
I'm gonna start moving
the civilians shortly

17:20.039 --> 17:21.666
and Dr. Stint will be arriving.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.501
I guess you guys
should speak to her.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.127
Do you think that this is--

17:25.127 --> 17:26.837
that this is dangerous
for everyone?

17:26.837 --> 17:28.673
I'm not qualified to say,

17:28.673 --> 17:30.883
but she is.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.219
-Dr. Stint!
-Why am I not surprised

17:33.219 --> 17:34.762
to see you three here?

17:34.762 --> 17:36.764
-You know these guys?
-Indeed I do.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.433
-Yeah, they belong to me.
-Well, they have illegally

17:39.433 --> 17:41.727
entered a police cordon

17:41.727 --> 17:43.562
and you're all old enough
to be arrested.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.273
Okay.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.899
Well, what did you see?

17:46.899 --> 17:49.485
It was some kind of... creature.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.862
Dr. Stint, I got close to it.

17:51.862 --> 17:52.905
And it...

17:55.533 --> 17:56.742
I'm just not sure
if it was friendly,

17:56.742 --> 17:58.327
that's what I'm saying.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.787
Damn it.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.289
Look,
there's too many people around.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.790
We were the first in the scene.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.375
I've got two
or three more officers.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.002
The MOD, they won't be here
for another hour

18:06.002 --> 18:07.336
-or so, so...
-Yeah, we don't

18:07.336 --> 18:08.754
have time to wait.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.839
I need
to start investigating now.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.009
Dr. Stint.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.095
Be careful.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.847
Don't worry, Herbert.
I know what I'm doing.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.323
That's strange.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.782
What the hell happened
over there?

18:36.782 --> 18:37.992
I don't know,
I can't explain it.

18:37.992 --> 18:41.162
But what is going on over there?

18:41.162 --> 18:43.331
Dr. Stint!
Have you got a moment to talk?

18:43.331 --> 18:45.291
I'm sorry, I don't.
Not right now, okay?

18:47.168 --> 18:49.879
If that goes out live, hundreds,

18:49.879 --> 18:52.798
maybe thousands of people
will descend onto this crater.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.800
We have no idea what
the Martians are gonna do.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.103
Move them back.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.813
Move them back, get them back.
Come on, move back!

19:51.232 --> 19:52.942
Run!

19:52.942 --> 19:54.693
Move, let's go! Move!

20:40.281 --> 20:42.741
Hannah, any ideas?

20:42.741 --> 20:45.327
Head for the bikes!

20:54.545 --> 20:56.088
Come on, Hannah!

21:05.848 --> 21:08.017
How many people
do you think it killed?

21:08.017 --> 21:09.435
I don't know.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.084
It's another landing.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.839
What should we do?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.925
Let's go back to my mom's.
Let's go.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.801
This way.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.183
Mom? Mom?

22:01.278 --> 22:03.447
She's already gone
to Leatherhead.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.533
Sorry, Herb.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.117
Do you think
we'll get through this?

22:13.374 --> 22:14.917
They're on their way
to the second landing.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.919
Yeah.
I think that's right.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.796
You know, let,
let's hope the military

22:18.796 --> 22:20.965
-can sort out the situation.
-We'll see about that.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.842
Why can't you be positive, man?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.728
...pebbles into space to wake

22:34.728 --> 22:36.605
what you can't possibly
understand,

22:36.605 --> 22:39.358
and now they've thrown
rocks back.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.110
And all you see
is the betterment

22:41.110 --> 22:42.570
of your prideful goals,

22:42.570 --> 22:44.405
reporting it on the television.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.782
My son paid for your sin,

22:46.782 --> 22:48.576
I paid for you sin!

22:48.576 --> 22:50.661
Sorry about that.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.080
Clearly, tensions
are running high here.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.374
Let me just see
if I can speak to--

22:55.374 --> 22:57.334
oh, Dr. Stint.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.503
-Just one moment, Doctor.
-One minute.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.213
Could you explain
to our viewers what you think

23:01.213 --> 23:02.840
the intentions
of the Martians might be?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.258
It's too early to say.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.926
We don't know what they want,

23:05.926 --> 23:07.720
we don't know
what they're capable of.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.722
We attempted
to have a dialogue,

23:09.722 --> 23:11.515
but they don't seem
in the mood for that, so--

23:11.515 --> 23:13.100
Any thoughts
on the second landing?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.560
We're investigating that.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.520
There's no activity so far.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.814
Any safety advice you'd like
to give to our audience?

23:18.814 --> 23:20.733
Stay at home and don't panic.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.443
Leave your radios and TVs on.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.278
We will broadcast updates.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.280
If you are near
any of the landing sites,

23:26.280 --> 23:28.324
do not approach them
and keep clear.

23:28.324 --> 23:31.035
Please, leave this to us
and let us do our jobs.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.245
That's all I have to say.
Thank you.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.622
Dr. Stint, please,
just one more question.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.124
Wait, no, no!

23:38.417 --> 23:39.543
No!

23:40.961 --> 23:42.630
Damn!

23:42.630 --> 23:44.923
-All the channels are dead!
-Right.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.509
I'll ring my mom to find out
what's going on in Leatherhead.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.018
Signal's dead.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.561
Try mine.

23:57.561 --> 23:58.687
Thanks.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.025
-No. No signal in yours, Hannah.
-Really?

24:03.025 --> 24:05.444
Mine is dead, too.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.237
Wait a minute.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.198
Do you think the satellites
have been compromised?

24:11.033 --> 24:13.160
Damn.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.579
My parents are in Manchester.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.539
Do you think this has hit them?

24:17.539 --> 24:19.041
No.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.877
They'll be moving too slowly.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.545
Why'd you say that?

24:23.545 --> 24:25.297
Because if
we're dealing with Mars,

24:25.297 --> 24:27.174
which I think we are,
then Earth's gravity

24:27.174 --> 24:28.592
is three times
stronger than Mars,

24:28.592 --> 24:30.844
so, you know, theoretically,

24:30.844 --> 24:32.596
they're gonna be down
here moving three times slower.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.265
Thank God, finally!
Something positive!

24:36.975 --> 24:38.769
My parents are probably okay.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.729
They're in Mallorca,
getting drunk,

24:40.729 --> 24:42.564
spending my inheritance.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.234
So what do we do?
Do we stay here or leave?

24:45.234 --> 24:47.152
What do you reckon?

24:47.152 --> 24:48.696
I think for now,
we do what the lieutenant

24:48.696 --> 24:50.072
on the television said.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.615
Stay put till we know more.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.659
Well, without
any communications,

24:53.659 --> 24:55.202
how are we gonna know that?

24:57.246 --> 24:58.455
I don't know.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.084
You know--you know what, guys?

25:02.084 --> 25:03.669
We'll probably be fine.
You know,

25:03.669 --> 25:05.295
our military has
state-of-the-art technology.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.755
State-of-the-art
for this planet.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.257
I mean, we're dealing
with a world

25:08.257 --> 25:09.675
that's millions of years
older than us.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.884
So what do we do?
Do we stay

25:10.884 --> 25:12.177
at home or do we hit the road?

25:12.177 --> 25:13.721
Stay here.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.305
We don't know
how many are out there.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.266
We don't even
know where we're going.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.479
Okay.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.358
We may be in conflict,

25:26.358 --> 25:28.527
but we're British, Hannah!

25:28.527 --> 25:30.195
Let's lick some cups of tea!

26:13.530 --> 26:14.990
Whoa!

26:14.990 --> 26:16.492
-Whoa!
-Oh!

26:16.492 --> 26:18.494
There's something in the garden!

26:41.975 --> 26:44.436
Hey, who is it?

26:46.897 --> 26:49.024
Say something! Show yourself!

26:51.860 --> 26:54.071
Easy!

26:54.071 --> 26:55.739
I'm Baxter.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.866
Ben Baxter. Uh, an artilleryman.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.536
What are you doing out here?

27:00.536 --> 27:03.080
I'm just looking
for a place to hide.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.543
Please? I just need to rest.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.797
Come inside.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.841
Please.
I'll meet you at the back door.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.056
-Are you nuts?
-It's a human, Oggy.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.809
Yeah?

27:23.809 --> 27:26.186
Besides, he's a soldier.
He might have information.

27:33.819 --> 27:34.987
Thank you.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.321
Of course.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.592
Is everything all right?

27:59.303 --> 28:00.637
They wiped us out.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.933
They just completely
wiped us out.

28:07.185 --> 28:10.147
Would you like a water
or a tea or something?

28:10.147 --> 28:11.732
Oh, come, come on, man.
He's a soldier.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.109
Give him whiskey or something.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.777
Yeah. Of course.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.990
All my friends,

28:21.575 --> 28:23.160
they just...

28:38.550 --> 28:40.552
I don't suppose
I could trouble you

28:40.552 --> 28:41.929
for another one, could I, chap?

28:41.929 --> 28:43.597
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.352
I'm, um, Herb, by the way.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.979
This is Oggy and Hannah.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.536
Do you wanna freshen up?

29:07.913 --> 29:09.748
Thank you.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.708
Yeah. The bathroom's--

29:11.708 --> 29:12.793
it's up the stairs.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.044
You're welcome to.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.042
So how did you get here?

29:56.253 --> 29:59.798
I got saved by blind luck.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.175
I lost my balance
and fell into a ditch

30:02.175 --> 30:03.885
the moment that heat ray struck.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.931
Wiped out my entire unit.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.933
I was the only one to survive.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.020
It wiped out the town
like it was nothing.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.565
And I was just frozen in fear.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.233
Do you have any idea
what they might want

30:18.233 --> 30:20.485
or where they might be headed?

30:20.485 --> 30:23.905
I'm not sure exactly.
But they're not far from here.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.574
Do we stay here
and hope the military

30:25.574 --> 30:27.159
have got it under control,

30:27.159 --> 30:29.870
or do we get as far away
from here as we can?

30:29.870 --> 30:31.913
I think we should definitely
hit the road.

30:31.913 --> 30:35.792
There's no way the military's
gonna get these under control.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.502
We're like ants.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.337
Where do you think we should go?

30:39.337 --> 30:41.256
As far away from here
as possible.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.634
I have to go to Leatherhead.
My mom's there.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.178
-Then we'll come with you.
-Yeah, man.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.763
No, no. You don't have to.

30:47.763 --> 30:51.391
No, listen, anything we do,
we do as a team.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.644
Thanks.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.605
Is it safe for us to go there?

30:56.605 --> 30:58.732
I can't say exactly.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.484
I lost my comms in that ditch

31:00.484 --> 31:02.527
and I've got no way
to communicate with command.

31:03.779 --> 31:06.865
Would a walkie-talkie do?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.034
Yes. Without the satellite,
that's the only way

31:09.034 --> 31:11.286
we could contact
any other military units.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.633
All right.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.968
The first cylinder
had landed here,

31:26.968 --> 31:29.429
and the second one was here.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.556
Now, you guys said you needed
to get to Leatherhead, right?

31:31.556 --> 31:34.226
-Yes!
-That's there.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.853
Let me see if we can find out
what the situation is.

31:36.853 --> 31:40.148
This is 19473F,
is anybody there? Over.

31:42.776 --> 31:47.114
This is 19473F,
is anybody listening? Over.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.950
19473F, is anybody there?

31:56.081 --> 32:01.044
This is 19473F,
is anybody there? Over!

32:01.044 --> 32:04.589
This is 18385D.
What are you looking for? Over.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.425
This is Ben Baxter,
artilleryman, Unit F,

32:07.425 --> 32:08.844
looking for a status update.

32:08.844 --> 32:11.304
Please identify yourself. Over.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.974
This is Corporal Fred,
Unit D command post.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.392
Good to hear from you.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.144
We thought Unit F had all gone.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.646
Any other survivors? Over.

32:21.148 --> 32:24.151
It's just me.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.278
I'm in a bit
of a hot zone here, Fred.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.655
-Uh, I'm in a residence, uh...
-Maybury Hill.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.490
...uh, Maybury Hill.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.784
We're about three clicks out
the first landing site.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.829
Uh, I'm with three civilians.
Over.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.122
Okay, Ben.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.456
We need you guys to move ASAP,

32:38.456 --> 32:41.084
get to a safe zone. Over.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.878
These guys need to get
to Leatherhead, Fred.

32:42.878 --> 32:45.046
Do you know
if the route's clear? Over.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.132
Leatherhead? Over.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.092
Yes, Leatherhead. Over.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.011
Negative.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.138
The third cylinder
landed at Pyford,

32:53.138 --> 32:55.182
and Tripods are crawling
all over there.

32:55.182 --> 32:57.058
Over.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.686
All right.
Let me get back to you. Over.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.898
Okay. One last thing.
Do not use petrol vehicles.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.858
The Martians can lock
onto the exhaust trails.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.485
Please use
alternative transport. Over.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.696
Copy that, Fred. Over and out.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.990
Godspeed. Over and out.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.077
What do you guys think?

33:16.077 --> 33:19.539
We go north to Weybridge,
down to Leatherhead.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.291
Right.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.210
I'll take you guys
as far as Weybridge.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.170
I can join
the other troops there.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.755
Right. Let's do this.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.673
We need to pack as much food
as possible.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.592
We've got no idea how long
this thing is gonna last for.

33:32.552 --> 33:35.764
Well, you heard what Fred said.

33:35.764 --> 33:36.890
It sounds like we're walking.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.643
We've got bikes.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.357
It's probably not the best time
to say this, considering, uh,

33:45.357 --> 33:47.108
but you look ridiculous
on that bike.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.027
-I look ridiculous, Oggy?
-Yeah.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.195
Martians landing
and taking over the world,

33:50.195 --> 33:52.364
and I look ridiculous?

33:52.364 --> 33:53.990
Huh. I think we're going
right soon, right?

33:53.990 --> 33:55.492
Yeah, it's definitely
next right.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.494
-Not yet.
-Hannah, it's the next right.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.246
We'll turn right
when I tell you to turn right.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.331
Listen, I'm telling you
it's the next right!

34:01.331 --> 34:02.540
Oggy!

34:05.418 --> 34:07.420
Fighters.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.381
Let me check in with Fred.
Hannah, give me the walkie.

34:12.175 --> 34:14.344
This is 19473F.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.929
This is Ben Baxter
looking for Fred.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.973
Are you listening, mate? Over.

34:17.973 --> 34:21.226
This is Corporal Fred.
Where are you guys? Over.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.727
Fred, we're in Woking.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.312
There's not much
of the town left here

34:24.312 --> 34:25.897
and we've just seen fighters
heading east.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.565
Is everything all right
over there? Over.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.609
Negative.
Stay to the west. Over.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.404
Roger that, Fred. Over and out.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.114
Let's keep moving.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.457
Oh, my God.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.645
We're too close here.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.272
We got to keep moving.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.315
This way.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.781
There you go.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.576
Welcome to Weybridge.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.703
Let me ask these boys
what the situation is.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.330
That sounds good.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.919
Lieutenant.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.338
Hi. Can I help?

35:31.338 --> 35:32.380
Ben Baxter.

35:33.923 --> 35:36.301
I'm all that's left of Unit F.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.511
I'm trying to get these guys
as far south as possible.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.347
Where are you going now?

35:40.347 --> 35:42.515
We're going to Leatherhead.
We're looking for my mom.

35:42.515 --> 35:45.018
I wouldn't suggest that at all.
It's very dangerous.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.437
A third cylinder just landed
very close to Leatherhead,

35:47.437 --> 35:49.356
the Air Force
is on their way there now.

35:49.356 --> 35:50.857
Well, what about the people
who've already been evacuated?

35:50.857 --> 35:52.817
We're moving everyone
towards London.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.736
So, I suggest your family
is on their way there now.

35:54.736 --> 35:57.113
-How is London?
-Clear so far.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.990
The underground
and the old bunkers

35:58.990 --> 36:01.785
offer more protection against
any attacks in the center.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.037
But right now, it's just
the town South of London.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.330
What about Manchester?

36:05.330 --> 36:06.790
No reports coming out yet.

36:06.790 --> 36:10.752
What about Mallorca?

36:10.752 --> 36:13.338
No reports of anything
coming out of Europe yet.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.131
If you go across that bridge,
you'll find Officer Marvin.

36:15.131 --> 36:18.343
He'll take your names
and arrange a boat for you.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.512
-Thanks, Lieutenant.
-Thank you.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.904
That's it. That's the base.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.324
Let's ditch the bikes here.

36:41.324 --> 36:45.286
Ah, I'll miss you, old girl.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.707
Seriously?

36:49.707 --> 36:51.501
Yeah.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.002
If we get through this,
I'm coming back for my bike.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.672
Come on, let's go.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.262
Well...

37:02.262 --> 37:04.264
at least we've got
the whole army with us.

37:04.264 --> 37:06.015
It's not gonna do
any good.

37:06.015 --> 37:08.476
Why? Is there really nothing
we can do?

37:08.476 --> 37:11.521
Against their shields, we might
as well be using bad language.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.898
-There's the queue.
-That's the one.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.859
Well, at least it's not as long
as we thought it might be.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.986
Or because everyone else
left town already.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.363
I'm gonna go check in
with the unit
and get some information.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.365
Catch you guys up.
You check in
with Officer Marvin.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.700
All right.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.460
Stop it! Stop it now!

37:33.460 --> 37:36.004
I said stop! All right?

37:36.004 --> 37:37.714
You two need to talk
your shits out,

37:37.714 --> 37:39.591
or there's neither of you
getting on the boat.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.802
Now, get back in line quietly,
and let us do our jobs.

37:42.802 --> 37:46.765
Corporal Fred, this is
a command post, please respond.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.224
Over.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.809
Yes, Captain.
This is Fred. Over.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.895
We are mobilizing
all units.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.939
Threat intel coming in.
How many civilians are with you?

37:54.939 --> 37:57.275
We currently have
approximately
20 civilians here.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.360
Over.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.070
Are there any more after that?

38:01.070 --> 38:02.614
Looks like
it's the last of them.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.199
We can't say for sure. Over.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.534
Make sure you are ready.
As I say--

38:06.534 --> 38:08.786
-And you, sir?
-Scott Jones.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.456
-And you, sir?
-Mark David.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.708
-And you, lady?
-Anne Fulbert.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.543
-And you, sir?
-Herbert Wells.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.671
Herbert Wells. And you two?
Uh, Hannah Jones.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.882
-Ogilvy Montague.
-Montague?

38:20.882 --> 38:22.675
Yeah.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.135
Captain Marvin, stand down.
These three are with me.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.136
Just carry on
down the line, please.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.305
Excellent. Thank you.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.433
Listen, I managed to get us
our own boat.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.019
-Which one?
-It's that one right there.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.229
It's nice.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.813
How'd you manage that?

38:35.813 --> 38:37.524
Benefits of knowing somebody
in the unit.

38:37.524 --> 38:39.317
Thank you, Ben, really,
for everything.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.612
Listen, it's me that has
to thank you. All of you guys.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.197
You really helped me out.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.532
Now, listen,
get yourselves on the boat,

38:45.532 --> 38:46.741
I'll get some supplies,

38:46.741 --> 38:48.326
and I'll catch you in a bit.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.544
-Montague?
-My first name is Ogilvy.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.837
Really having issue
with Montague?

38:59.837 --> 39:01.631
Your parents
didn't like you much, did they?

39:01.631 --> 39:02.966
Oh.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.845
This has to be them.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.764
Excuse me. Does one of you
happen to be Daniel?

39:09.764 --> 39:11.808
-Yeah. It's me. You're Herbert?
-Yeah.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.393
-This is your boat here, okay?
-Thank you.

39:13.393 --> 39:14.435
Listen, you got to row it
yourself, okay?

39:14.435 --> 39:15.478
Okay.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.189
All right. Great.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.025
Oh, oh, looks like we're rowing.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.237
Yes, it does.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.824
-Are we all set?
-Gotta wait for Ben.

39:27.824 --> 39:31.369
-How wrong was I?
-About what?

39:31.369 --> 39:36.165
Walkie-talkies, maps, compasses,
all low-tech technology.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.376
You're right.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.879
-I will be, yeah.
-Okay.

39:42.171 --> 39:45.425
Aww, what a nice candid moment.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.302
-Shut up, Oggy.
-Gotta get it on camera.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.304
Uh, give me
my camera back, Oggs.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.597
What? At least it is waterproof.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.056
But it's not Ogilvy-proof.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.099
-Your mom's not Ogilvy-proof.
-Huh.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.434
Ugh.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.235
Whoa.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.913
Go on! There's more, run!

41:00.792 --> 41:02.251
Come on!

41:02.251 --> 41:03.628
-Help.
-Hannah, come on. Hurry up.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.591
Come on, move.

41:28.361 --> 41:30.196
We need to get
out of here.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.823
Yeah. One of us
is unconscious at the moment.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.534
Yeah, we're gonna have
to carry her. Carry her?

41:34.534 --> 41:35.952
-She's, she's awake.
-She's waking up.

41:35.952 --> 41:39.956
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.791
What happened?

41:41.791 --> 41:43.167
You kind of fell over
and hit your head,

41:43.167 --> 41:44.752
so we brought you through here.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.129
Look, they took out
the whole military.

41:46.129 --> 41:47.755
We have to go, now.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.925
-Yeah. Give me a hand.
-Yeah?

41:50.925 --> 41:53.386
Oh, okay.
All right. Wait, wait, wait.

41:53.386 --> 41:54.804
You good?

41:54.804 --> 41:58.349
-Okay.
-Three, two, one.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.809
I need my bag.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.938
Okay. Let's go, guys.
See if we can find the boat.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.314
Thanks.

42:34.594 --> 42:37.138
Guys, look.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.766
We can take this boat
and try and make it to London.

42:39.766 --> 42:41.517
Sound like a plan?

42:41.517 --> 42:42.977
Fine by me.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.063
We should give it a push,
I guess.

43:13.091 --> 43:14.634
God, look at this place.

43:19.055 --> 43:22.767
-I hope Ben made it out okay.
-Yeah.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.405
Look, we need to find shelter.

43:36.405 --> 43:37.573
Otherwise,
we're gonna to turn ice

43:37.573 --> 43:39.200
by the time we reach London.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.660
Okay. Let's just find
somewhere to hold up.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.152
Nope. It's dead.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.991
Do you think
it'll ever work again?

44:19.991 --> 44:22.243
Always has before, maybe.

44:22.243 --> 44:23.953
I don't think so.

44:23.953 --> 44:25.621
Never the optimist.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.249
Guys...

44:30.543 --> 44:31.961
who is that?

44:34.463 --> 44:35.756
Hello?

44:37.633 --> 44:39.093
Are you okay?

44:51.063 --> 44:52.148
It's okay.

44:53.399 --> 44:55.651
Do you sin, boy?

44:58.154 --> 45:01.908
Are you clear of conscience
and pure of heart?

45:04.118 --> 45:07.580
Padre, this boy
is as pure as they come.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.373
He hasn't sin a day in his life.

45:09.373 --> 45:12.001
He won't even Google
the answers to the crossword.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.836
Yeah.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.171
We're all gonna die.

45:17.632 --> 45:19.508
This is the end of humanity,
the human race.

45:19.508 --> 45:22.470
We have abandoned God,
and now he is punishing us.

45:22.470 --> 45:24.513
Sorry, who, who are you?

45:24.513 --> 45:27.725
Why, why are you sat
on that log?

45:27.725 --> 45:31.771
I'm one of God's
loyal messengers.

45:31.771 --> 45:33.439
Are you--are you local--
are you a local priest?

45:33.439 --> 45:35.566
Do you--
do you know the area well?

45:35.566 --> 45:37.151
Do you know where we are?

45:38.694 --> 45:40.404
Look, we've just been
by the river.

45:40.404 --> 45:41.864
We're just, just looking
for somewhere to get...

45:41.864 --> 45:43.032
We're all gonna die.

45:46.661 --> 45:48.120
You really should keep
some hope, father.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.207
It's the beginning of the end.

45:51.207 --> 45:53.084
How can we escape?

45:54.627 --> 45:56.212
They can't be destroyed.

45:56.212 --> 45:57.463
We saw them get destroyed
this afternoon.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.006
That doesn't matter.

46:01.509 --> 46:06.180
We humans deserve this.

46:06.180 --> 46:09.183
For too long, we've ravaged
and raped the planet,

46:09.183 --> 46:12.311
and succumbed
to impulsive desires.

46:15.314 --> 46:18.609
You've brought this all
on yourselves with you,

46:18.609 --> 46:20.987
your youthful folly.

46:22.947 --> 46:24.740
I tried, Lord.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.450
Do you know what?

46:26.450 --> 46:29.328
Over there is an actual
invading Martian army.

46:29.328 --> 46:32.373
And over there,
our army is amassing as well.

46:32.373 --> 46:34.417
So you can stand around here
if you like

46:34.417 --> 46:35.960
bemoaning the human race

46:35.960 --> 46:37.503
and guess what?
You'll meet both of them.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.714
And you'll probably be turned
into ash.

46:39.714 --> 46:41.716
Or you can just be decent
and just help us.

46:42.758 --> 46:44.343
Tell us where to go.

46:46.262 --> 46:47.304
Please.

46:50.099 --> 46:51.851
Okay.

46:51.851 --> 46:55.813
It's--it is possible...

46:58.024 --> 47:01.819
in that direction,
you may find some houses

47:01.819 --> 47:05.364
and maybe some food, too.

47:05.364 --> 47:10.327
-Thank you.
-Hey, uh, let's make a move.

47:10.327 --> 47:13.497
This guy is nuttier
than squirrel shit.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.583
What gives you that idea?

47:15.583 --> 47:17.710
I'm quite sane. Thank you.

47:19.545 --> 47:21.922
I'm the only one
who understands.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.091
Come on, guys.

47:24.091 --> 47:25.676
You kids had best repent

47:25.676 --> 47:27.303
before it's too late.

47:27.303 --> 47:29.305
Whatever you say, Padre.

47:29.305 --> 47:33.225
I can save you.

47:33.225 --> 47:34.977
I can save all of you.

47:43.652 --> 47:45.446
We're here.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.554
It looks like the owner
didn't have time

48:10.554 --> 48:12.056
to take their luggage.

48:23.317 --> 48:24.443
Thank you, Lord.

48:26.612 --> 48:28.697
Can you not see these are mine?

48:28.697 --> 48:31.575
Take yours from the bag.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.494
What?

48:33.494 --> 48:35.079
What does it matter if I take
my food from there or there?

48:35.079 --> 48:38.707
I took these,
therefore they belong to me.

48:38.707 --> 48:41.502
If you want your share,
take it from there,

48:41.502 --> 48:43.254
not from my share.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.881
What happened to share
and share alike, Padre?

48:45.881 --> 48:48.300
Isn't that in the bible?

48:48.300 --> 48:53.264
You paraphrase the bible,
you blasphemer.

48:53.264 --> 48:57.518
Do not disrespect
and dishonor a sacred text.

48:57.518 --> 48:59.186
Sacred text?

48:59.186 --> 49:00.896
It's a bunch of gibberish.

49:00.896 --> 49:02.314
-Oggy.
-What?

49:02.314 --> 49:04.024
-Slow down.
-No.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.818
This guy is an asshole!

49:05.818 --> 49:07.319
Oggy, just leave it.

49:07.319 --> 49:08.654
What kind of priest
is this anyway?

49:08.654 --> 49:10.114
He's clearly crazy.

49:10.114 --> 49:11.574
What do you wish of me, Father?

49:13.492 --> 49:16.078
Father, what do you wish?

49:19.373 --> 49:21.250
Listen you little prick,

49:21.250 --> 49:23.961
you better stay away
from my food.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.921
God does not want me
to help you.

49:25.921 --> 49:28.048
You're all sinners. All of you.

49:28.048 --> 49:31.802
You, and you, and you.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.358
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

49:46.358 --> 49:48.611
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

49:48.611 --> 49:50.404
Please, please don't kill me.
Calm down.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.281
Calm down.

49:52.281 --> 49:54.491
-Please don't kill me.
-What do you wish of me, Father?

49:55.951 --> 49:58.412
Put it down, Padre.

49:58.412 --> 49:59.830
Please.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.332
Please put it down.
Don't kill me.

50:01.332 --> 50:02.750
Please don't kill me.

50:02.750 --> 50:05.544
Please. Please.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.396
Okay. Okay.

50:25.898 --> 50:28.192
Okay.

50:28.192 --> 50:32.238
Listen, pal,
we can get out of your way,

50:32.238 --> 50:33.989
you can have this place
to yourself, yeah?

50:35.241 --> 50:36.283
No.

50:37.409 --> 50:38.702
You stay.

50:41.413 --> 50:44.041
He hasn't decided on
your destiny yet.

50:45.834 --> 50:48.170
I will tell you
if and when you may go.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.880
Now, sit!

51:54.987 --> 51:56.947
You must eat, woman.

51:58.365 --> 52:00.826
You are the weaker sex.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.453
Keep your strength up.

52:05.664 --> 52:07.750
Thank you.

52:07.750 --> 52:10.836
You see, gentlemen,
a little respect,

52:12.087 --> 52:13.964
this woman puts you to shame.

52:13.964 --> 52:15.716
Yeah. We're sorry.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.308
There may come a time soon

52:24.308 --> 52:28.103
when the repopulation
of the planet must begin.

52:28.103 --> 52:30.731
Only the great
may give you their seed.

52:33.067 --> 52:35.235
As God's messenger,
I shall be one.

52:37.780 --> 52:41.283
These troglodytes,

52:43.327 --> 52:46.622
they may not infect you
with their inferior seed.

53:20.739 --> 53:22.199
What happened to you?

53:24.576 --> 53:27.162
What made you turn your back
on everything you stand for?

53:28.705 --> 53:30.791
I haven't turned my back, boy.

53:32.418 --> 53:33.627
No.

53:35.712 --> 53:38.424
I've never been
clearer of my purpose.

53:41.385 --> 53:46.348
For too long,
I found myself questioning Him.

53:48.809 --> 53:52.521
I would question the disasters
of the world and hear nothing.

53:55.357 --> 53:57.109
Then He took my wife.

53:58.861 --> 54:00.237
Cancer.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.741
I questioned Him
night and day after that.

54:04.741 --> 54:08.120
"Why, God, why?"

54:08.120 --> 54:10.873
I'd served Him so faithfully,
one moment of doubt

54:10.873 --> 54:11.999
and He took her from me.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.253
Then I hated Him.

54:16.253 --> 54:18.464
I questioned His reason again.

54:21.717 --> 54:24.094
And He took my daughter.

54:26.722 --> 54:30.017
Then these things came
from the sky and He,

54:33.437 --> 54:34.980
He took my son.

54:38.484 --> 54:43.697
But then, I finally heard Him.

54:45.157 --> 54:47.659
I heard His voice.

54:47.659 --> 54:49.495
Now I understand.

54:49.495 --> 54:52.915
I understand my sacrifice.

54:52.915 --> 54:57.169
What it took for me to hold
court with our great Lord.

54:57.169 --> 54:59.838
It took everything.

55:03.675 --> 55:05.552
I'm so sorry.

55:08.263 --> 55:10.766
Don't be sorry, woman.

55:12.434 --> 55:15.062
What I have lost
in mortal distraction,

55:15.062 --> 55:17.523
I have gained
in eternal greatness.

55:21.151 --> 55:26.406
And I will be reunited
with my loved ones eventually.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.375
Now...

55:39.086 --> 55:41.213
I mean, to take a nap.

55:44.341 --> 55:48.845
And I want no one to disturb me
or come close.

55:50.430 --> 55:52.891
If you do,

55:52.891 --> 55:57.771
I will carve the name of God
into your flesh.

57:22.731 --> 57:23.774
Get down.

57:47.673 --> 57:49.007
It's gone.

57:51.677 --> 57:54.262
Sinful fiend.

57:56.056 --> 57:58.558
I warned you what would happen.

57:58.558 --> 58:02.187
-Just--please, just--
-Oh, Lord, give me guidance.

58:02.187 --> 58:03.814
How do I help these sinners?

58:03.814 --> 58:05.190
-Father, you need to--
-Do not silence me!

58:05.190 --> 58:06.650
-Okay. Okay.
-Shh!

58:11.279 --> 58:13.365
Father,
come away from the window.

58:15.742 --> 58:19.496
He has spoken.

58:22.833 --> 58:26.878
We should all be grateful.

58:26.878 --> 58:28.922
The Lord has been merciful
to you.

58:28.922 --> 58:34.553
He has granted
you two safe passage.

58:34.553 --> 58:37.431
Safe passage to the next world.

58:38.849 --> 58:41.226
And a quick death in this one.

58:41.226 --> 58:44.563
You must live for now,

58:44.563 --> 58:46.940
to fulfill his will.

58:46.940 --> 58:48.483
You need to...

58:56.533 --> 58:58.076
Go!

58:58.076 --> 58:59.578
Go!

58:59.578 --> 59:01.204
Oh, God.

59:57.928 --> 01:00:01.389
This is Corporal Ben Baxter
to Hannah, Ogg, and Herb.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:06.102
Where are you? Please respond.
Over.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:10.190
This is Corporal Ben Baxter
to Hannah, Ogg, and Herb.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:14.945
Can you hear me?
Please respond. Over.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:19.449
This is Corporal Ben Baxter
to Hannah, Ogg, and Herb.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.327
Can you hear me?
Please respond. Over.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:24.204
Ben, it's Hannah.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.956
We're here. Are you okay? Over.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.667
Hi, Hannah, I'm here.
I'm okay.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.544
Are you guys all good? Over.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:33.922
Yeah, we're just holed up by--
in a house by Richmond.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.257
Where are you? Over.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.759
I'm at Putney Hill. Over.

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.135
Whereabouts?

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.806
Uh, near the forest. Over.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:45.016
Okay. We'll come find you.
Stay put.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:47.227
Excellent.
See you guys soon.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.645
Over and out.

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.625
What is this red
weed thing everywhere?

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.128
Maybe they're
terraforming the planet.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:14.754
That's plausible.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:17.299
Whatever it is,
it's giving me the creeps.

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:18.800
Yeah.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.051
Me, too.

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.533
Does anyone know where we are?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.619
-We're here.
-Okay.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:48.663
And the woods are,
like, near there.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.206
So that way?

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.625
There's only one way
to find out, right?

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:52.709
Yeah.

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:10.894
Look. What's that?

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.107
I don't know.

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:17.609
Could be a signal?

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:19.945
Only one way to find out.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:29.496
Guys, let's hope
this ain't another crazy priest.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:31.414
Oh, it's Ben!

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.625
Hi, guys.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.669
Good to see you.
We can't stay here.

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.003
We gotta keep moving.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.797
Take this. Follow me.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.429
Welcome to Camp Baxter.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.767
-Oh, dang.
-What is all this?

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:53.728
These are the supplies
I was telling you about.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.147
Oh, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:58.358
So what? How do you use this?
Are you gonna teach us?

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:00.652
Put that down.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:03.279
You point it at the bad guy
and you pull the trigger.

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.657
-Now, don't touch it again.
-Yes, sir.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:07.993
For Christ's sake,
don't call me sir.

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:10.203
Look, if you want
something to play with,

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.997
this is a solar powered radio.

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:13.164
We're actually
in a pretty good spot here.

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:14.624
You might be able to pick up

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.167
some of the pirate radio
frequencies.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.168
Bit old school for you,
isn't it, Oggy?

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.253
Shut up, Herbert.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.510
Do you think
it's safe here, Ben?

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.178
With the fire on
and everything.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.514
Well, so far,
there haven't been any reports

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.433
of any landings near here.

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.852
So
we should be all right.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.188
You hungry?

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:39.899
Uh...

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.317
I think we've
kind of filled up...

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.028
Yeah, we had lima beans,
sardines.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.154
---from--yes, we had the tins.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.363
-Sure.
-Uh-hmm.

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:57.667
Are we still aiming for London?

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.419
I don't know.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:02.505
Things have changed a bit
since the seventh landing.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:05.050
-Seventh landing?
-Yeah.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.885
Primrose Hill.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.429
All of the Tripods seem
to be heading in that direction.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:10.847
What about all the people
that have been evacuated

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.098
to London already?

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.558
They shipped most people

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.101
across the channel to Belgium.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.644
And our best guess
is that everybody else

01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:18.605
-has now gone into hiding.
-Into hiding?

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:20.065
All we seem
to do is bloody hide.

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:21.775
When are we gonna
stand up and fight?

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:28.782
There's gotta be a better way
to deal with this situation.

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.366
Well, I've been thinking
about that.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:32.952
There is one possibility.

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.164
Which is?

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:38.333
We go underground.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.542
We live in the sewers.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.045
Look, I know that's not great,

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.422
but maybe if we're out of sight,
they'll leave us alone.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.508
You want us
to live in the sewers?

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:48.384
BEN The point is,
Oggy, that we live.

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.178
That's absurd.

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:51.679
Furthermore, there's no
guarantee that we'll be safe

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:53.098
-down there anyway.
-No, there's not.

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:54.766
But what other option
have we got?

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:56.267
They could stomp us
into extinction like that

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.477
because we are nothing to them.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.187
Oh, you keep saying that.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:01.231
But we saw one get taken
out at Weybridge, no?

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.608
You wanna hear
what's going on out there?

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:05.568
Because I'll show you.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:09.072
This is 19473F.
Is anybody there? Over.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.784
Copy, 19473F.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.369
What are you looking for? Over.

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.329
We're trying to get to London.

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:17.747
Can you give us a status update
of what's going on out there?

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.958
-Over.
-Pretty bad.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:22.085
Tripods are capturing humans
and collecting them like

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.878
cattle at Primrose Hill.

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.755
So, I strongly advise
you stay out the way.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.841
-Over.
-Copy that. Over.

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:32.554
Now, do you really
wanna go to London?

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:33.930
Sorry, Herb,
I think Ben's right.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.014
Cool.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.538
Stop it.

01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.831
Fool. Give me that.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:03.251
I don't care
if you hurt yourself,

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.044
but I'm not having you blow
the rest of us out, you fool.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:07.672
No worries.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.850
I know this is awful.

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.771
But, you know, I kind of
feel safe with you, guys.

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:28.776
Especially you, Herb.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.451
You know, you're braver
than you think you are.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.206
That's what my dad
used to say to me.

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.126
Usually when I was
getting something wrong.

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:51.299
Like, it took me until
about age nine to learn

01:06:51.299 --> 01:06:53.718
how to ride a bike.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.136
I think every other kid
in the neighborhood

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.138
had it down by about six.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.771
I'd be practicing and failing,

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.232
and he would always just say,
"Keep going, Herb."

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.818
"You're braver than
you think you are."

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.373
I'm gonna keep trying.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:26.459
I'm going to Primrose Hill.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.964
-Are you nuts?
-Look,

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.715
they're gonna keep collecting us
one by one.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.509
We can keep running
and keep hiding,

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:36.052
or we can actually join
the rest of the human race

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.804
-and we can fight.
-We need to find out

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:38.930
what they're doing,
why they're collecting people.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.099
No. No way. I'm not going.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:45.687
Why the hell not?

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:47.438
For Queen
and bloody country, right?

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.857
-Are you serious?
-Oggy...

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:52.026
we're going. We are.

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:55.113
So whether you come
with us or not,

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.323
it's up to you.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.993
Really? Herb, Hannah!

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:02.287
Ben!

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:11.504
-Do you guys know the way?
-No.

01:08:16.342 --> 01:08:19.846
There isn't
a single person around.

01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:22.223
Did they manage to take
many people up to Belgium?

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.892
Trying to get
as many people east as possible.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:26.644
-Whereabouts?
-Tillingham,

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:28.855
that's where they've got
the ships to Ostend.

01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:30.064
Do you think
there's gonna be enough ships

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:31.357
to get everyone out?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.900
I've got no idea, mate.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.878
Jesus Christ.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.218
What chance do we have
against them?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.930
Can't believe it.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.557
We should carry on.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:05.975
Hannah's right.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.685
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:37.090
Just go around here.
Go! Go around.

01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:40.051
Stay. Stay here.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.720
Just wait.

01:09:48.726 --> 01:09:50.061
Any second.

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:05.618
All right, now.
Now, go! Run! Run!

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.335
Come on.

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:16.212
Come on, Hannah. Come on.

01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:24.303
Jesus Christ.

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.347
Look at the size of that thing.

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:31.853
Why are the Tripods going
around this end?

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.276
I think we need to get closer,
take a better look.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:42.613
Yeah. We go around west,

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:44.240
down past the woods.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.285
Oh, hold on a second.
Just slow down.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:49.454
I'm not getting any closer
than we are right now.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:50.872
I don't wanna turn
into a pile of ash.

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:52.582
Oggy, we're going
that way anyway,

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.292
so you either come with us
or you just stay here.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.085
You know what, I don't know
what's going on here,

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.920
but I'm sick and tired of you
giving me ultimatums.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.422
What happened to team spirit?

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.674
Okay. In team spirit,

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.634
why don't you and Ben
stay here as a team

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:05.595
and me and Hannah
will go down there as a team?

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:06.929
Are you sure about that?

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.306
Yes.

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.974
Could you watch us with the gun?

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.142
-Sure.
-Thanks.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.145
All right. Great idea.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:15.980
I'm gonna go try and find us
a better angle.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.691
Don't know why everyone's
so heroic all of a sudden.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.902
Don't worry, mate.

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:23.112
We weren't expecting
any heroics out of you anyway.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.281
Yeah, all right.
Calm down, John Wick.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.944
Are they nesting?

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:06.572
Get down.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.715
Oh, my God.

01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:37.061
It's feeding.

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:40.565
Go. Go on.

01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:47.905
What do we do?

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:49.782
Call Ben.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:51.826
Ben, Oggy, are you there?

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:56.163
Hi, Hannah. We're here.
Everything's fine.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:57.999
Nothing so far.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:00.626
You guys find anything?

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.753
I--I--I can't even begin.

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:04.922
But we need to leave now.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:07.133
Is Oggy with you?

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.302
Oggy's with me. He's fine.
He's just keeping--

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.761
Jesus, Oggy, behind you!

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.266
Guys, they've got Oggy.
I'm in pursuit!

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:17.977
Ben?

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.772
Okay, go. This way!

01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:28.863
Ben! Ben!

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:31.449
I'm coming, Oggy!

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:43.127
Hey!

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:45.087
Over here, you piece of shit!

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.078
Ben!

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.417
Oggy!

01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:25.920
Oggy!

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.632
Go, go, go, go.

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:42.978
This way, come on.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.628
Guys, in here!

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.894
Guys.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.604
Oggs, help me!

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.481
We need to get out of here, now.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.408
No way.
I'm not going down there.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.869
We can't stay here.

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:56.719
What is this?

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.804
No idea.

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:02.975
Okay. Try down here.

01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:10.232
Okay. Fine.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.650
We'll just--we'll just
stay here for a while.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.736
-We'll just hide out.
-Why?

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:15.488
So we can live out
Ben's stupid idea

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:16.864
of living in the sewers
and eating rats.

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:18.324
Show some respect. That man died

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:19.784
saving our lives, Oggs.

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:22.036
Hannah, shut up!

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:23.913
You're not my mom.
Stop telling me what to do.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.623
-Oggy, that's enough. Leave it!
-You know what,

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:27.291
both of you could shut up.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:28.709
It was your idea to come
to London, wasn't it?

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.795
So don't tell me
he died saving me.

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:33.214
He died because your little
boyfriend wants to be a hero.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:34.465
Oggs!

01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:36.175
This is no one's fault!

01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:39.386
We all made this decision.

01:16:39.386 --> 01:16:41.847
And we're gonna have
to stay here, okay?

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.518
Okay.

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:48.771
Whatever.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:09.500
Herb?

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.965
What to do when we...

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:21.137
go up tomorrow
and the world is...

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.763
a totally different one?

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:28.811
Well, I think the first thing

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.021
we do obviously is,
is repopulate.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.650
What, with your inferior seed?

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.901
That's it.

01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:41.365
No, I don't know.

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:44.785
I don't even know
if my mom is still okay

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.412
or if she's up there or--

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:53.252
I don't know anything.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.882
But we'll be together.

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:38.005
What?

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:40.049
Should we go
and have a look outside?

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.472
Wait. Wait. Listen.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.101
Don't hear anything.

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:52.645
Yeah.

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:54.521
No bombing, no shooting.

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:55.981
It's all stopped.

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:58.233
Let's go and have a look.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.665
It's too quiet.

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:15.000
I think
the military's been wiped out.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.002
What about everyone
else in London?

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:21.006
Something seems wrong.

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.633
Should we carry on
to Primrose Hill?

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:24.343
Yeah, okay.

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:25.678
Let's do this.

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.107
Oh, God.

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:43.988
What on earth?

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.035
It looks like it's dying.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:04.800
Is that--
is that alive?

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.719
I think it's dead.

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.429
Well, listen--
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.140
We need to know.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.808
I don't trust
these guys.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.235
Right. Let's check it out
but stay in the trees.

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:25.070
We don't know
what's happening here.

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:40.544
Look. What's happened to it?

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:53.766
It might be
playing dead.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.152
Oh.

01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:08.155
Oh, my God. God.

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:09.740
I don't think
they're pretending.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.126
Oh, it's Dr. Stint.

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:24.588
Oh.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.257
My students, I am very glad
to see you made it.

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.259
So what on earth happened?

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.512
-Simple science.
-What do you mean?

01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:33.222
We tried everything.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.225
They defeated our military
at every attempt.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.185
What took them down,
Mother Nature.

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:40.104
Mother Nature?

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:42.231
The bacteria that our body
is perfectly capable

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.899
of living in harmony with,

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.943
the Martians,
they couldn't cope with it.

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:47.653
So they suffered and they died

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:49.738
at the hands of our little
microscopic friends.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.074
I can't believe
all that tiny bacteria

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:53.617
beat these giant Martians.

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:55.452
Wait. Hold on.

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:57.287
So you're saying...

01:21:57.287 --> 01:22:00.624
that my armpits
are more damaging

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:02.960
-than all the Martians combined?
-Oggy!

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.711
-Something like that.
-Yeah. Your armpits

01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:06.880
always have been lethal weapons.
Don't.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.674
You need to come with us now.

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:11.051
Let's connect with the other
survivors in Ostend.

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:12.928
So are we in the clear?

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:14.721
Well, London
and the surrounding areas

01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:17.474
are gonna stay in quarantine
for some time, I imagine.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:19.810
But so far,
there are no alien survivors

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:22.646
and crucially the landing
has stopped.

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:24.565
Dr. Stint, do you copy?

01:22:24.565 --> 01:22:26.233
Sergeant, hi.

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:27.276
Are they there?

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.194
Yes, I'm with them now.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.571
Excellent. Put them on, please.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:32.030
Herbert.
I got some news for you.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.450
Hello?

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.785
Herbert. Is that you?

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.871
Mom. Where are you?

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:40.789
Are you okay? Is everyone okay?

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.416
Yeah. Ogilvy is fine.
Hannah's fine.

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:45.002
I'm--I'm--I'm fine.

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:46.503
They're taking me home.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.172
-Will you be there?
-Yeah, okay.

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:49.798
I'll--I'll--I'll,
um, I'll see you at home.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.133
Come quick, Herb.

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:52.259
Mom...

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.387
I love you.

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:56.930
I love you, too, sweetheart.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.932
I've gotta go.
I'll see you soon.

01:22:58.932 --> 01:23:00.309
-No.
-Come here.

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.897
Come on. After you.

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.857
Thank you.

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.709
The creatures saw our species

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:28.670
that was self-destructive,

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:32.466
weak, and ready to be conquered
by higher beings.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.428
What they didn't count on

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.347
was that the world we inhabit

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:43.185
is also home
to the smallest organisms.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:46.021
These microbes
became the ultimate protector

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.356
of humanity

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.983
against these alien invaders.

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:53.403
The air they breathe, the food
and the water they consumed

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:55.948
were slowly killing them
the whole time.

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:59.243
As humans,

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.828
we may have lost the battle
on our own

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:03.789
but the earth won

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:05.374
for now.
