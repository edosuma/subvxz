00:00.959 --> 00:02.210
Previously on Rosewood,

00:02.711 --> 00:03.962
Her name, Elena Santiago.

00:04.045 --> 00:06.089
Elena's father
is a Panamanian diplomat.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.633
Misty was taken two days
after Elena's body was found.

00:08.717 --> 00:12.429
We think that Misty and Elena
were held in a bunker in the woods.

00:12.512 --> 00:15.306
Gerald Kelly has been in prison
for 10 years for the murders.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.809
His daughter, Michelle Kelly,
she took off before the murders

00:17.892 --> 00:19.352
and hasn't been seen since.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.896
Either Michelle's the victim,
or she's the killer.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.815
I've done everything I can
to uncover the truth.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.735
Then do this one last thing for me.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.779
To re-investigate Elena's murder,
we need to exhume her body.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.948
-Is everything okay?
-It's empty.

Misty.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.833
I'm gonna get you out of here, Misty.

01:23.917 --> 01:24.959
No, it's too late.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.087
No, it's never too late.
We need to get back.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.757
Another nightmare?

01:31.424 --> 01:32.717
Was I that transparent?

01:33.134 --> 01:36.471
No, you were talking in your sleep, loud.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.973
And you were calling the name "Misty."

01:39.057 --> 01:40.308
It's not what you think.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.687
Besides, I don't snore
like someone else I know around here.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.898
-Talking crazy. I don't snore.
-You do snore.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.567
It's like a buzz saw making love
to a chain saw.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.777
Shut up.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.948
Is that...um...

01:55.532 --> 01:57.450
Misty Spencer and Elena Santiago.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.203
Two girls that Gerald Kelly
is accused of killing.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.455
Okay, Rosie, it's 4:00 in the morning.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.999
-You need to get some rest.
-No, I wish I could,

02:05.083 --> 02:07.794
but I need to figure out
who the real killer is.

02:07.877 --> 02:11.548
Hey, I understand, but you're no use
to anyone,

02:11.631 --> 02:13.383
so let me shut this down,

02:13.842 --> 02:15.969
and you can look at it
with fresh eyes in the morning,

02:16.052 --> 02:17.595
-which is in two hours.
-All right.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.515
Well, maybe I can finish that dream
and find some answers.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.853
-All right.
-All right, see you in the morning.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.532
You got a visitor.

02:41.744 --> 02:45.582
Good news. We finally got permission
from Mrs. Santiago

02:45.665 --> 02:47.500
to exhume her daughter's body.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.586
And the bad news?

02:50.086 --> 02:52.714
-And who said there was bad news?
-You didn't have to.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.467
When they pulled the coffin
up from the grave,

02:57.302 --> 02:58.595
it was empty.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.054
Empty?

03:01.764 --> 03:04.058
We're looking into what happened
to the body.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.686
Wow!

03:08.730 --> 03:10.148
Okay.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.232
Hell,

03:11.691 --> 03:14.777
But I have complete faith
everything is gonna be okay, Donna.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.488
Okay.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.490
So I've got some other good news.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.285
Villa's looking
for your daughter, Michelle.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.622
She tracked some of her old things
to your cousin, Lonnie.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.165
I think it'll help us find her.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.127
What is it?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.087
Michelle and I,
we fought about everything,

03:33.922 --> 03:36.716
you know, from her partying to curfews to

03:37.425 --> 03:38.676
her wardrobe.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.055
I'm, not surprised that she ran away.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.098
I drove my daughter away.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.143
I, was just too damn hard on her.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.396
I've been in here for 10 years.

03:50.813 --> 03:54.108
This whole time,
Michelle has not come to visit me,

03:54.192 --> 03:55.693
not one time.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.278
Now, I don't care how angry she was.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.239
I know she would have come to visit me.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.785
But whoever is framing me
for this, these murders,

04:05.286 --> 04:06.704
what if they got her, too?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.714
Um, Guys, wasn't the point here
to examine the body?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.341
- Where's the body?
- We don't have a body.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.426
-We have a coffin.
-Yeah, it's a coffin-Topsy.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.136
What? A coff... No.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.431
No, this is terrible. Well, ugh...

04:25.890 --> 04:27.767
She's gonna be here any minute.
She already left.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.560
-Who?
-Who?

04:30.270 --> 04:34.440
Ah, I probably should have checked
in with you first, my man.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.901
Yeah, I invited
my college roommate here

04:36.985 --> 04:39.237
just to hang for the autopsy, so...

04:39.487 --> 04:41.739
Right, 'cause taking her to coffee,
that would've just been weird.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.616
Well, you're just gonna have to
take her for a daiquiri on the beach.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.201
But she'll be so disappointed.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.870
But okay. What exactly
are we looking for?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.790
Any evidence that shows
Elena Santiago's body

04:50.873 --> 04:53.584
-was even in this coffin.
-So we just need to...

04:53.668 --> 04:55.336
Test for the presence
of embalming fluid,

04:55.420 --> 04:59.465
collect hair and fiber samples
and run any DNA against Elena's.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.134
-Thank you, dear.
-Oh that, okay.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.385
Mom, it's nice to see you

05:02.468 --> 05:04.095
take an interest
in evidence collecting.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.680
Son, I was married

05:05.763 --> 05:07.849
to a forensic pathologist
before you were born,

05:07.932 --> 05:11.269
so you might as well put me to work,
because I am not going anywhere.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.939
Mom, we got this.
You're too cute in that apron.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.191
Really, darling?
And how many coffin-autopsies

05:17.275 --> 05:19.319
-have you done before?
-Ooh.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.281
Mmm? That's what I thought.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.953
I mean, how does a body
just disappear out of a coffin?

05:29.037 --> 05:31.706
Grave robbers, aliens?
I'm just trying to help.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.791
Can you help me get
the search warrant signed?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.585
I need to get into the funeral home

05:35.668 --> 05:38.129
that buried Elena, but the judge
thinks Gerald's guilty

05:38.212 --> 05:41.049
-and I'm wasting my time.
-You are not wasting your time.

05:41.132 --> 05:44.177
You are gonna solve this thing,
and then afterwards,

05:45.178 --> 05:46.471
you can make it up to me.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.473
No, I plan to.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
Ah, workplace camaraderie.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.236
Just as nothing like a little team
building exercise in elevators.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.946
We weren't team building
in the elevator.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.240
Come on. You got that team
building glow all around you,

06:06.324 --> 06:07.575
all up and around there.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.577
Hey what, you know what you should do?

06:09.660 --> 06:11.662
You should do the thing
where you fall back,

06:11.746 --> 06:13.456
-and Adrian catches you.
-Trust fall.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.084
-See? The trust fall. We're thinking.
-Stop it, the both of you.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.752
Stop it, you two. Why are you here?

06:17.835 --> 06:20.004
Well, I got the results back
from the coffin-Topsy.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.090
Turns out that there was no trace
of decomposition,

06:22.173 --> 06:24.384
no trace of embalming fluid or DNA.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.803
So there was never
a body in that coffin.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.138
Too bad the funeral director
is stonewalling me.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.599
-Mm, you're not thinking of...
-Ah, actually, I'm thinking about this.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.018
-Just got to get Villa on board.
-That's a great idea.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.645
I think so. Hey, Why don't you come
with us?

06:35.728 --> 06:36.896
Plenty of room in the Yellow Queen.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.898
I really don't like this thing
you guys have going on.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.691
-Let me see.
-All right. See you later.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.652
- Enjoy your day. Good seeing you.
- You, too.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.737
So, ready for a little coffin shopping?

06:45.321 --> 06:47.156
Or are you trying to go back
into an elevator?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.033
Just asking. It's a question.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.792
-Is that a...
-Welcome. Welcome.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.919
Has there been a death,
or are we planning ahead?

07:00.002 --> 07:01.712
-Planning ahead.
-It's my mother.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.173
Planning ahead
for my mother's passing.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.134
Well, you have come
to the right place.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.719
I have top-of-the-line
mahogany and silk,

07:08.803 --> 07:10.721
fully sealed, full preservation.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.181
Great deals.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.269
What kind of deal do you cut
for someone burying an empty coffin?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.480
I don't do that sort of thing here.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.524
If you'll step right over here,
I have some great sample books

07:21.607 --> 07:22.692
- I can show...
- Really?

07:22.775 --> 07:25.736
Because you did it
for Elena Santiago 10 years ago.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.698
Detective Villa, I meant to return
your calls.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.992
You know, it's not illegal
to bury an empty coffin.

07:31.075 --> 07:34.745
Wow, tell me, Detective, is it illegal
to falsify body transfer documents?

07:34.829 --> 07:37.415
-Actually, Doctor, yes, it is.
-Okay, okay.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.042
But it wasn't me. He wanted to bury
the empty coffin.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.169
Who?

07:41.252 --> 07:43.713
-The father, Carlos Santiago.
-What happened to the body?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.090
Coroner's office dropped it off,
and Mr. Santiago picked it up.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.009
And you just let him leave
with her body?

07:48.092 --> 07:51.721
It's my job to let the family grieve
in whatever way they need.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.558
How about you try that again?

07:56.184 --> 07:58.686
He paid in cash, a lot of cash.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.938
So where did he take the body?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.316
I don't know. You'll have to ask him.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.989
So there are rumors
of Santiago's involvement

08:10.072 --> 08:12.325
in drug trafficking,
that maybe Elena died

08:12.408 --> 08:13.534
because of something
he was involved in.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.828
-Or maybe he killed her.
-His own daughter?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.330
Well, we're talking about a man

08:17.413 --> 08:20.249
who went to extremes
to bury an empty coffin

08:20.333 --> 08:22.668
-and hide his daughter's body.
-Yeah, that's a good point.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.378
Hashtag Rosie.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.546
What you guys been up to?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.381
Oh, let me guess. No,
don't tell me.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.966
You guys have been practicing
your salsa moves?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.009
Arguing about nothing?

08:30.092 --> 08:32.053
-Taking partner selfies?
-I like that one, Cap.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.554
-What's happening here?
-I have no clue.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.890
You know what Ira, I think
I just figured it out.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.600
-Me too. Yeah, I got it.
-Yeah?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.895
You guys reopened a 10-year-old
double homicide case.

08:40.978 --> 08:43.564
Involving the daughter
of a Panamanian diplomat.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.611
Now why don't you guess
how we found out?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.323
Follow me.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.750
Mr. Santiago, we spoke to your wife.

09:02.833 --> 09:07.004
No, you went behind my back
and got the coffin exhumed.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.216
-Which you paid to bury empty.
-What happened to Elena's body?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.598
Mr. Santiago,
we're all on the same team here.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.601
-We all want the truth.
-Your wife needs the truth.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.065
You don't understand.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.150
I grew up in Panama.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.652
The jungle there gives cover

09:29.735 --> 09:33.030
to drug traffickers and guerrillas.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.783
One day, I came across an open grave.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.702
Bodies decomposing.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.205
That moment, I swore that I'd get out,
and I did.

09:42.248 --> 09:46.419
I made a new life here
in Miami, but...

09:48.379 --> 09:51.257
In the end, you couldn't save
your daughter from the same fate.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.677
Elena was strangled.
She was buried under a field,

09:54.760 --> 09:56.387
and her body
was almost unrecognizable.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.058
I couldn't stand the thought
of my baby girl

10:01.976 --> 10:03.769
decomposing in a coffin like that.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.273
So what'd you do with her?

10:17.283 --> 10:19.201
This is Elena Santiago.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.163
It's time to bring her real killer
to justice.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.222
Um, everyone, I'd like you to meet
my old college roommate,

10:40.306 --> 10:43.392
Dr. Daisy Wick, and she's visiting
from the Jeffersonian.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.353
Yeah, she works
with Dr. Temperance Brennan.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.187
The Dr. Brennan?

10:46.270 --> 10:48.147
The most incredible
forensic anthropologist

10:48.230 --> 10:51.233
on any planet in the solar system
and also extremely easy on the eyes.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.027
Like, hot.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.612
-Okay.
-You must be Mitchie.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.364
Well, I really appreciate
your enthusiasm,

10:56.447 --> 10:59.408
and rest assured that I am also
incredibly gifted.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.161
-Welcome, dear.
-Oh, you must be Mrs. Rosewood.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.204
Nice to meet you.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.914
Dr. Wick, thanks for giving us a hand.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.040
Of course, Dr. Rosewood.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.292
I'm really excited
to be working a case with Tara.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.835
It's like spring break all over again.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.630
"Girls Gone Wild, Miami Edition."

11:12.713 --> 11:15.675
Except that we're both at the top
of our fields and wearing bras.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.094
You must be Pippy. Oh, my God.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.304
Tara has told me so much about you.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.432
Just how amazing you are
and how in love with you she is

11:23.516 --> 11:25.393
and who wouldn't fall in love
with you?

11:25.476 --> 11:28.521
Actually, we broke up.
So there's that.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.484
All right, so, everyone,
let's get to work.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.987
See if the crematorium
did a shoddy job,

11:37.071 --> 11:39.240
maybe we can find something else
other than ashes.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.892
I got something.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.396
A tiny ruby. With what looks like
a trace of titanium.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.148
Slipped through the grinding process.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.150
A piece of jewelry?
That sounds familiar.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.068
But she wasn't found wearing
any jewelry. And maybe,

12:16.152 --> 12:18.946
maybe it was something that her family
put on her for the funeral?

12:19.029 --> 12:20.489
Maybe it has some sentimental value.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.700
Son, Gerald showed me a picture
of his daughter, Michelle,

12:22.783 --> 12:25.161
wearing a ruby and titanium necklace.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.412
So Michelle and Elena,

12:26.495 --> 12:28.831
two high school girls,
wearing the same type of jewelry?

12:28.956 --> 12:30.040
That is no coincidence.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.917
Well, some serial killers
take trophies.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.210
Maybe this one gave gifts.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.670
Well, if that is the killer's MO,

12:35.087 --> 12:36.714
Michelle could be our first victim.

12:37.715 --> 12:38.883
Michelle disappeared six months

12:38.966 --> 12:40.468
before our other two victims
were found.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.886
Well, if she was the first victim

12:41.969 --> 12:43.512
and they were all held
in that same bunker--

12:43.596 --> 12:46.182
It could explain why Michelle's blood
was on Misty's jeans.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.225
Well, Hornstock tracked down
Michelle's cousin, Lonnie.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.144
He just brought in a bunch
of Michelle's old stuff.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.646
Well, maybe we'll find something
that will point us to our killer.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.357
So what exactly
are we looking for?

12:55.441 --> 12:59.028
A diary, photos, letters.
Oh, wait a second.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.406
Michelle's old fake ID.
It's from Maryland.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.742
Hologram, bar code. Looks legit.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.452
And I talked
to her high school buddies.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.703
None of those preppy wannabes

13:07.787 --> 13:09.330
were capable of making fakes
that clean.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.333
Well, high-end papers
means high-end criminals.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.960
We need to talk to whoever made
this ID.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.671
Are you gonna track down someone
who made fake IDs 10 years ago?

13:17.755 --> 13:18.881
-We know a guy.
-We know a guy.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.016
-Hey.
-Ah, uh-um... Mm-Hmm.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.268
Don't even look my way
till you turn 21, girl.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.937
Yeah, baby!

13:34.563 --> 13:35.564
Joo-Joo.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.274
Y'all are late.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.944
A grown-ass man like myself
shouldn't be at a party like this.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.862
You could've just
come down to the station.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.572
Villa, let me man-splain
something to you.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.366
-Man-splain? Did he just say...
-No, man-splain.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.742
Just good old what
are we doing here?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.495
Hey, you see this guy?
He's the best that money can buy.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.540
He's got a print shop inside.
So you come for the booze,

13:52.623 --> 13:53.958
you stay for the fake ID.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.377
Then you leave and buy more booze
with your new fake ID.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.838
Joo-Joo, are you slipping?
'Cause unless this kid started

13:58.921 --> 14:01.966
making IDs since he was 10 years old,
this is not our guy.

14:03.801 --> 14:04.802
Manny.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.430
Come tell my new friends here
how long you been doing this.

14:09.181 --> 14:12.226
I've been forging doctors' notes
and detention slips since I was five.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.895
I was a forgery prodigy. A "fodigy."

14:14.979 --> 14:17.147
No offense to your friends here.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.317
I know black don't crack
and beige don't age,

14:20.401 --> 14:22.152
but y'all don't need no fake ID.

14:22.736 --> 14:26.907
My man, Detective Villa's
not beige. She's blue.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.243
-More like caramel.
-All right, listen, fodigy,

14:29.326 --> 14:30.619
we're not here for the fake ID party.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.830
-Is this your handiwork?
-Nah, blue.

14:32.913 --> 14:36.166
My work is so good, it don't end up
in police hands

14:36.417 --> 14:38.294
'cause they can't tell it's fake.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.546
Can you tell if my foot
is coming up your ass?

14:40.629 --> 14:42.882
-'Cause it is.
-Cool. Let me see that.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.847
It's some good work.
It's not mine.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.181
Whose is it?

14:52.224 --> 14:55.144
Okay. Listen, we know
someone obviously trained you.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.314
I, really don't feel like
filling up my holding cell

14:58.522 --> 15:00.524
with you and all of your underage
clients.

15:00.608 --> 15:01.901
Okay, hang on. Let me see it.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.320
-I think I'm remembering something.
-Make it good.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.700
This is Lo Down's work. My mentor.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.118
When was the last time
you've seen him?

15:11.201 --> 15:12.786
When he gave me the business
10 years ago.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.705
-About the same time as the murders.
-Right.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.789
Where can we find him?

15:15.873 --> 15:18.667
You don't. If there was such
a thing as witness protection

15:18.751 --> 15:21.253
for the streets,
this guy invented it, ran it,

15:21.337 --> 15:23.631
and became its best client.
He's a ghost.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.049
I don't believe in ghosts.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.177
And party's over, you got five minutes
to shut this thing down.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.386
Joo-Joo, you said they were cool, man.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.138
-Four minutes.
-Why do you hate me?

15:31.221 --> 15:33.557
-Three minutes, right.
-Everybody got to go!

15:35.559 --> 15:38.729
The guy's name is Lorenzo Veras,
AKA Lo Down.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.606
He also made fake IDs
for Misty and Elena

15:40.689 --> 15:42.066
and half their classmates,

15:42.149 --> 15:44.485
and the person who helped him
sell the IDs?

15:44.818 --> 15:46.028
Michelle Kelly.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.488
He's connected to all three girls.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.031
And there were complaints
lodged against him

15:49.114 --> 15:52.076
at the high school for selling
fake IDs and drugs to the girls.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.244
The parents who banned him
from the high school,

15:54.328 --> 15:56.330
Beth Santiago and Lynn Spencer.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.040
The mothers of the two deceased.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.209
Sounds like motive to me.
So go get him.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.754
He's not exactly local.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.174
Cotton or linen?

16:07.257 --> 16:09.426
Uh, definitely the linen.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.053
That's what I thought.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.098
So, eh, how did Villa
track down the guy?

16:14.181 --> 16:15.975
His mother lives here in Miami.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.769
Wow. Mom snitched on her own son?

16:18.852 --> 16:20.270
No, well, Villa couldn't break her,

16:20.354 --> 16:22.106
so she checked her financial records.

16:22.189 --> 16:25.484
Turned out Mama Lo Down
makes a trip every August 19th.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.528
What's so special about August 19?

16:27.611 --> 16:29.405
-It's Lo's birthday.
-Ah.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.532
Excuse you, ladies.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.243
Really?

16:34.326 --> 16:36.245
What? No. I can't have my shoes
touch my shirts.

16:36.745 --> 16:39.206
-Separate suitcases.
-Okay, this isn't a vacation.

16:39.289 --> 16:42.668
I know that, Villa. We're going
to take down a killer.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.170
But we're gonna do it in style
because we're going to...

16:47.131 --> 16:48.132
Cuba.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.182
So how do we find this Lo Down?

16:57.266 --> 16:59.601
Well, the local cops
pointed me to his new hustle.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.146
Toiletries and toothpaste.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.107
So we go undercover
and offer him soap and shampoo.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.233
There's our guy.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.277
Look, it's the East Miami PD.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.737
See? I told you to lose the hat.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.071
I have moles all over the city.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.115
Detective Villa. Dr. Rosewood.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.701
They alert me
to foreign police officers.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.995
Please, sit.
Join me for un cafecito Cubano.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.372
Wait, we're in Cuba, right?
So isn't it just cafecito?

17:20.456 --> 17:22.041
You know, your moles
aren't very loyal,

17:22.124 --> 17:23.834
'cause they led us right to you.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.085
I'm not worried.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.920
Cuba has no extradition treaty
with the US,

17:27.004 --> 17:28.922
so you have no jurisdiction.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.466
No, but Panama does.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.135
And since you're accused
of killing the daughter

17:33.218 --> 17:36.388
of a Panamanian, Elena Santiago,
as well as Misty Spencer

17:36.472 --> 17:38.932
and possibly even Michelle Kelly,

17:39.016 --> 17:41.268
you should be at least
un poquito nervous.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.271
Well, that is a stretch.
And what's my motive?

17:44.354 --> 17:46.273
Oh, I don't know. Maybe the fact
that Elena's parents

17:46.356 --> 17:47.983
lodged a complaint against you
at their school,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.611
-which ruined your business.
-You can't prove anything.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.405
No, you're right. They can't.
But I can.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.449
One little swab of DNA

17:56.075 --> 17:57.659
might even get you
into a Cuban prison.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.828
Or a Panamanian one. I can just
make a call right now.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.205
Wait.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.463
I didn't kill Elena, Misty,
or Michelle.

18:09.546 --> 18:10.714
And I can prove it.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.008
But you have to come with me.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.052
Vamos.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.516
All right, yeah, call the Panamanians.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.559
I was bluffing. No bars.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.812
So no reception and no backup

18:24.895 --> 18:26.730
in a country where
we have no jurisdiction.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.816
We could be walking into a trap.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.067
I'm with you.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.076
-Michelle?
-You're Gerald's daughter.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.964
You were really hard
to find, Michelle.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.549
Not hard enough, I guess.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.425
We thought you were dead.
What happened to you?

18:55.509 --> 18:57.094
Life with my father was unbearable.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.680
He was mad at the world
and took it out on me.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.975
I couldn't do anything right
until I met my boyfriend, Harley.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.936
He was older, secure, stable.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.689
-I ran away with him.
-Here, to Cuba?

19:08.772 --> 19:10.190
No, not at first.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.860
We stayed in Miami till news
broke about the murders.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.111
If I had stayed with my father,

19:14.194 --> 19:15.821
I could have ended up
like those girls.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.865
You really think
Gerald killed Misty and Elena?

19:17.948 --> 19:20.868
I lived with him. I saw
how volatile he had become.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.578
I was afraid of him.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.455
And when I saw the media circus
it turned into,

19:25.539 --> 19:29.042
I asked Lo to help us get out,
and I've been in Cuba ever since.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.210
Where's Harley now?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.378
In Miami.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.047
He runs Cuba art tours.
He's getting a group together.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.465
And you've never gone back?

19:35.841 --> 19:38.510
I can't go back to where
I'd be the daughter of a killer.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.763
Well, I mean, the only problem
is that your father's not a killer.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.432
He's innocent. We're gonna prove it.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.268
See, Elena had a ruby
and titanium necklace.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.353
We think the killer gave one to her

19:48.437 --> 19:50.022
and another one to you.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.315
You're wrong.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.942
I made these necklaces.
It's how I make a living.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.235
So you made one for Elena?

19:55.569 --> 19:56.945
Maybe. I don't remember.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.072
Okay, well, we need you
to come back to Miami with us,

19:59.156 --> 20:00.657
help us figure some things out.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.617
Excuse me?

20:01.700 --> 20:04.369
I don't have to do anything
you're telling me to do.

20:05.662 --> 20:09.166
Well, okay, you can come with us now,

20:09.249 --> 20:12.461
or I'll make sure you can
never come back.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.172
You really want to stay here
for the rest of your life?

20:15.255 --> 20:16.423
Sounds like your boyfriend doesn't.

20:16.506 --> 20:17.507
You know, I don't like
when people come

20:17.591 --> 20:19.509
into my house and threaten me.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.595
This isn't Miami.
You're not a cop here.

20:21.678 --> 20:22.846
You are nothing here.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.475
I'm a cop wherever I go.
You want to try me, Maria?

20:26.558 --> 20:28.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Timeout, excuse us.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.647
-Villa, what are you doing?
-What does it look like?

20:31.730 --> 20:34.066
We need to get her back to Miami
and she's being difficult.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.442
No. You're being difficult.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.070
-Her story doesn't add up.
-Your story doesn't add up.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.863
-What?
-Look, okay, just let me handle it.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.156
-Okay.
-Let's see.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.242
So, listen, you need to know

20:43.325 --> 20:45.744
your father's been in a prison
for 10 years, grieving.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.914
-He thinks you're dead.
-Good. Let him keep thinking that.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.001
Okay, Did you not hear me
say that he was innocent?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.170
I heard the part where you said
you hadn't proved it yet.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.463
Okay, I'm done. You go.

20:57.464 --> 21:01.760
You know, I haven't seen
my con man father since I was 15.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.929
But if he was accused of murder,

21:04.012 --> 21:05.889
I would still go look him in the eye

21:05.973 --> 21:07.724
and see what he had to say
for himself.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.352
You never once called or visited.

21:11.019 --> 21:14.898
What, making trinkets for tourists

21:14.982 --> 21:16.942
while your father rots in prison?

21:17.693 --> 21:20.028
Well, I'll be damned
if I came all the way to Cuba

21:20.112 --> 21:21.738
looking for the truth,
and the one person

21:21.822 --> 21:23.991
who can help us find it
refuses to try.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.581
In breaking news, Michelle Kelly,

21:31.665 --> 21:33.625
the daughter of convicted
murderer Gerald Kelly...

21:33.709 --> 21:34.584
Hey, stop.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.587
...has returned to Miami after having gone
missingsome 10 years ago.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.256
Now, the case against Gerald Kelly

21:39.339 --> 21:42.467
rested on the fact that Michelle
had disappeared before the murders,

21:42.551 --> 21:44.803
leaving her father distraught
and then leading him

21:44.886 --> 21:48.223
to kill two of her classmates.
And here she comes now.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.808
- Do you have any comment?
- Michelle.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.727
Michelle, where have you been
all these years?

21:52.811 --> 21:54.646
Did your father try to kill you, too?

21:54.730 --> 21:56.815
- Hey, excuse us.
- Any comment?

21:56.898 --> 21:58.608
- Excuse us.
- Anything?

22:00.736 --> 22:03.363
I can't do this. This is exactly
what I've been trying

22:03.447 --> 22:04.614
to avoid all these years.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.742
We're still gonna need
to take your statement at some point.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.869
I need to call Harley.
Can I use your phone?

22:08.952 --> 22:11.621
That won't be necessary. I'll take you
where you need to go.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.123
No, you've done enough, Villa.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.334
You're in my house now. I insist.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.753
And it's Detective Villa.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.339
All right, why don't we use the back?

22:22.924 --> 22:24.593
So now you're the hospitality
committee?

22:24.676 --> 22:26.720
I'm keeping her close by.
She's hiding something,

22:26.803 --> 22:29.306
and until I figure out
what it is, she's a suspect.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.307
If Michelle is the killer,

22:30.390 --> 22:32.017
why would she risk
coming back to Miami?

22:32.100 --> 22:34.269
Because she thinks
she's getting away with it,

22:34.436 --> 22:35.729
or she wants to get caught.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.357
Sometimes killers need recognition.
You got any better ideas?

22:38.482 --> 22:40.067
Yeah, I'm going back to the body,

22:40.317 --> 22:42.611
back to the ashes. Go easy on her.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.241
-Lonnie?
-Michelle?

22:49.326 --> 22:50.494
It's really you.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.456
-You look great. Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.168
I'm just glad to see you.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.213
-You need a moment?
-No.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.215
Please get me out of here.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.634
Excuse us.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.598
Hey, why don't we go in my office,
have a talk?

23:15.018 --> 23:17.062
So you and your cousin Lonnie,

23:17.354 --> 23:18.563
what was that all about?

23:20.232 --> 23:22.859
Back in high school,
Lonnie and I had a huge falling out.

23:23.860 --> 23:26.780
Okay, I'm gonna need you to be
a little more specific.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.367
I used to shoplift a lot.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.662
Lonnie caught me one time,
and he told my dad,

23:33.745 --> 23:36.206
and my dad told all the girls
on the soccer team.

23:36.289 --> 23:37.833
They bullied me for months.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.001
-Elena and Misty did?
-Yep.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.587
They would accuse me
of stealing their stuff,

23:42.796 --> 23:44.756
go through my bags, pat me down.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.259
What, you gonna arrest me
for shoplifting now?

23:47.342 --> 23:50.220
Michelle, your blood was found
on Misty's jeans.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.764
I mean, how do you explain that?

23:52.848 --> 23:55.475
What? I can't.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.977
Okay, so let me get this straight.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.229
The two girls who bullied you
end up dead.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.190
The father you fought with
ends up being framed

24:02.274 --> 24:04.443
for their murders,
and you leave the country

24:04.526 --> 24:05.986
without looking back.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.865
Wait, did you want to give me a ride,

24:09.948 --> 24:13.034
or did you want to interrogate me?

24:21.626 --> 24:22.836
Welcome home, baby.

24:28.717 --> 24:29.676
Thank you, Detective.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.803
I've been trying
to bring her back for years.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.639
No need to thank me.
I'm just trying to find a killer.

24:34.723 --> 24:38.143
I didn't kill those girls,
and I didn't frame my father.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.520
If that's the best you can do,
he'll never be free.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.772
Thanks for the ride, Detective.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.448
Tell me you've got something.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.617
I found a lateral malleolus fragment

24:53.700 --> 24:56.119
with a small section
of the medullary cavity intact.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.246
You know, you could just say,

24:58.330 --> 25:00.040
"bone fragments with bone marrow."

25:00.123 --> 25:02.709
But then you'd have no indication
of what bone it was

25:02.792 --> 25:04.753
or where in the body it came from or...

25:04.836 --> 25:06.505
Okay, Daisy's always been very into

25:06.588 --> 25:08.298
dotting her I's
and crossing her T's, right?

25:08.381 --> 25:11.051
You know, I always thought it was cute
when people happy-faced their I's.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.429
Attention to detail, and that is what
makes Daisy so good at her job.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.515
That and my brilliant mind.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.809
Anyway, Daisy and I have been
working on this for hours.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.811
Dr. Wick, am I also paying you
for those hours?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.438
I'm just doing it for fun
and for free,

25:23.522 --> 25:25.148
-but if you're offering...
-I'm not.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.400
So do you think you have enough
bone marrow to pull tox from?

25:27.484 --> 25:28.401
We'll know soon.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.694
-Son.
-I'll keep you posted.

25:29.778 --> 25:30.612
Thank you.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.948
- Yeah, that's probably...
- Yeah, maybe I could...

25:34.407 --> 25:36.034
Gerald knows that Michelle is back.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.203
Why won't she go see him?
He's innocent.

25:38.286 --> 25:41.206
Yes, he is, but Villa thinks
Michelle may not be.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.457
What?

25:42.874 --> 25:45.293
Villa thinks that Michelle
is guilty?

25:45.919 --> 25:48.505
That doesn't make sense.
And what do you think?

25:48.588 --> 25:51.258
I don't know, but if we don't
find another lead,

25:51.508 --> 25:53.677
that father-daughter reunion's
not gonna be a happy one.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.554
Who wants tox results?

25:55.637 --> 25:56.638
Me, I do.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.724
It looks like Elena was drugged
with morphine and fentanyl

25:59.808 --> 26:00.809
just before her death.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.894
Wait. Why wasn't that
in Gerald's file?

26:02.978 --> 26:04.437
Maybe somebody made a mistake.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.690
Or someone on the case left it out
on purpose.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.738
I talked to the ME,
who did Elena's autopsy in 2006.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.824
He said he included the tox results
in her file.

26:15.907 --> 26:19.286
And the investigating detective said
he handed everything over to the DA,

26:19.369 --> 26:20.662
including the tox results.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.122
So the only other person who had

26:22.205 --> 26:24.833
access to the autopsy report
and the police file is...

26:24.916 --> 26:26.501
The DA who prosecuted the case.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.169
-Right.
-So get him in here.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.463
Well, the former DA
is a washed-up ambulance chaser.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.215
There's no way he agrees to talk to us

26:32.299 --> 26:33.425
if it's about the Kelly case.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.635
Ah, come on. Get creative.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.137
And I think I know how.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.221
Good.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.308
Okay, which one of you cops
beat up my...

26:41.391 --> 26:44.352
Mm, savagely beat up.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.187
Savagely beat up my client?

26:46.271 --> 26:47.564
That would be me.

26:47.647 --> 26:48.648
Oh.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.532
I was profiled. You know it.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.576
And now America will know it.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.286
Unless you're willing to settle.

27:01.369 --> 27:04.247
Ernie Portnoy. You used to be
that hotshot DA right?

27:04.331 --> 27:06.958
You prosecuted the Gerald Kelly case?

27:07.042 --> 27:10.545
That doesn't ring a bell.
Now back to my client's injuries.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.005
You know what?

27:13.757 --> 27:15.216
I'm feeling so much better.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.803
I was set up.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.017
What's this?

27:24.100 --> 27:25.644
It's proof that Elena Santiago

27:25.727 --> 27:28.146
had morphine and fentanyl
in her blood.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.815
We know you omitted it
from Gerald Kelly's defense file.

27:30.982 --> 27:34.402
You were trying to get another win
to advance your career,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.446
but clearly, that didn't work.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.032
Damn.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.867
Busted.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.702
Now that's how it's done.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.829
-No.
-I got you.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.289
Give me some.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.167
-My man.
-You guys just dabbed.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.293
Yeah, we did.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.754
I presented all of the information
relevant to the case.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.547
Yeah, but what about Gerald's case?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.841
You robbed him of a chance
to defend himself.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.635
I think that's known as evidence
tampering.

27:58.718 --> 28:01.262
-Yeah.
-Damn, maybe you should get a lawyer.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.722
Listen, you can talk to us,

28:02.806 --> 28:04.724
or you can talk to Captain Slade.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.102
Interrogations for him
are a full-contact sport.

28:07.185 --> 28:10.021
So true, but don't you worry.
If you get hurt,

28:11.189 --> 28:12.357
Rosie's a doctor.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.110
Okay, look. Look.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.987
The evidence pointed to another person

28:18.071 --> 28:20.198
who had allegedly used
the same cocktail of drugs

28:20.281 --> 28:22.200
in previous incidents
with other girls.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.452
Incidents? No, I think

28:24.536 --> 28:27.372
the word you're looking for
is "assaults."

28:27.831 --> 28:29.499
Look, I left him out of the equation

28:29.582 --> 28:31.751
because I didn't want his name
dragged through the mud.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.503
How do you know he's innocent?

28:36.089 --> 28:37.507
Because he's my godson.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.676
And the plot thickens.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.261
Damn, I'm good.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.523
Gunnar Tiegen.

28:53.606 --> 28:54.983
Trust fund baby turned lifeguard.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.276
So he knows CPR.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.027
He can bring someone back
from the brink of death.

28:58.111 --> 29:00.155
Yeah. Sounds like a God complex to me.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.365
Let's see.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.993
Mandy Bennet, Virginia Jacobs,

29:05.076 --> 29:07.245
Lidia Levin, and Elena Santiago.

29:07.996 --> 29:08.955
I don't know any of them.

29:09.038 --> 29:11.207
Really? That's interesting.
Because you gave them all

29:11.291 --> 29:13.168
morphine and fentanyl
before you assaulted 'em.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.628
There's no evidence of that.
Just allegations.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.713
Now there's Elena.

29:16.963 --> 29:18.423
Yeah, you know, the woman
that you drugged

29:18.506 --> 29:20.341
and you strangled her,
then you brought her back with CPR,

29:20.425 --> 29:22.927
then you strangled her again
until she died. You remember her?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.929
Portnoy admitted to covering for you.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.431
You talked to my godfather?

29:26.514 --> 29:28.683
He's gonna lose his law license
for trying to help you.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.602
You want him to go to prison, too?

29:31.644 --> 29:33.021
Tell us what happened to Elena.

29:35.023 --> 29:38.026
Okay. I saw Elena the night
she disappeared.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.153
She came to my place
after soccer practice.

29:40.236 --> 29:42.322
I gave her some drugs
to help her loosen up,

29:42.405 --> 29:44.199
but she didn't. And then she left.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.658
I swear, I didn't hurt her.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.243
She walked home safe and sound.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.536
But she never made it home.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.164
Look, I've been trying to make up

29:51.247 --> 29:53.416
for my past mistakes,
but I did not kill her.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.501
I swear it.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.590
Gunnar passed the polygraph.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.634
We couldn't hold him.
And we can't charge him

30:02.717 --> 30:04.969
with drugging Elena
or any of the other girls

30:05.053 --> 30:06.805
because the statute
of limitations expired.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.014
So we hit a wall.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.808
Luckily, walls are
where I do my best work.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.268
The only real suspect left
on the table is Michelle.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.854
Villa, come on, now.
Michelle is not capable of murder.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.191
Rosie, why do you have
such a blind spot

30:18.274 --> 30:19.734
for this girl? Look at the evidence.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.903
Michelle's blood was found
on Misty's jeans.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.280
Michelle's jewelry was found
in Elena's cremains.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.950
Both victims bullied her,
giving her motive.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.868
The reason she hasn't gone
to visit Gerald

30:28.952 --> 30:30.620
is because she hated him so much

30:30.703 --> 30:31.996
that she framed him for their murders.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.290
Look, I want to solve this
just as much as you do.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.167
I'm having nightmares.
My mother can't sleep.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.503
TMI, she's calling in favors.
Gerald is still sitting in prison--

30:38.586 --> 30:41.256
-But you wouldn't consider Michelle.
-Because even if I do, there's no way

30:41.339 --> 30:42.215
he's gonna walk out of that cell

30:42.298 --> 30:44.050
knowing his daughter's
gonna take his place.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.680
So we're right back to that wall.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.855
I know what you're looking for.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.731
What am I looking for?

30:58.815 --> 31:00.108
It's not here.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.529
Sorry, I thought you were having
another nightmare.

31:05.655 --> 31:06.573
How's the case going?

31:06.656 --> 31:09.701
Well, let's see. I still have
an innocent man in jail,

31:10.493 --> 31:12.036
the attorney who tampered
with evidence

31:12.120 --> 31:14.455
gets early retirement, no jail time.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.916
And the guy that he was covering for
gets to walk free,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.252
even though he drugged
a bunch of girls.

31:20.837 --> 31:21.838
Wow.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.548
What's the point
of following the rules

31:23.631 --> 31:25.425
if they make different rules
for different people?

31:25.758 --> 31:28.177
Just means we have to work
harder to get justice, that's all.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.431
But, damn it, I'm missing something.
I know I am.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.559
Well, I guess I'll let you work
this time.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.769
Otherwise, you'll go back
to dreaming about Misty.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.730
-And,
-Elena.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.566
Yeah.

31:41.649 --> 31:42.901
Elena.

31:43.776 --> 31:44.777
Elena.

31:46.362 --> 31:47.947
You pulled me out of my warm bed

31:48.031 --> 31:49.699
to come look at this
creepy place again.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.910
-We already searched it.
-Yeah, but not like this.

31:52.869 --> 31:53.703
What is that thing?

31:53.786 --> 31:55.997
It's a Geiger counter.
It detects radiation.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.218
-That can't be good.
-No, it's great.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.721
It's radium. It's exactly
what I needed to confirm.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.681
Rosie, what are you talking about?

32:17.435 --> 32:19.062
Everyone wake up and listen up.

32:19.145 --> 32:20.688
The bunker where Misty's body
was found

32:20.772 --> 32:22.231
had high levels of radium

32:22.315 --> 32:24.400
which seeped into the air,
the water, and the ground.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.152
Now, if Elena was held there

32:26.235 --> 32:27.862
for the three weeks
that she was missing,

32:27.946 --> 32:29.822
she would have ingested
large quantities.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.824
If she ingested radium,
it would have seeped

32:31.908 --> 32:33.117
into her blood and her bones.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.535
Is it detectable after all this time?

32:34.619 --> 32:37.413
Well, the half-life of radium
is 1,600 years, so, yes,

32:37.497 --> 32:39.499
it would still be in her bones
and in her cremains.

32:39.582 --> 32:40.917
So if Elena was in that bunker,

32:41.000 --> 32:42.418
this Geiger counter will tell us.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.677
Wait, hold on. Does that mean...

32:50.760 --> 32:52.553
Elena wasn't killed in that bunker.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.306
We've been looking in the wrong place.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.688
If Elena wasn't killed in the bunker,
where was she killed?

33:01.771 --> 33:05.316
Well, Elena was last seen here.
Gunnar Tiegen's house.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.318
But her body was found

33:07.902 --> 33:09.821
here, under the school's soccer field.

33:09.904 --> 33:12.448
All right. Well, we know that
Elena was held for three weeks

33:12.532 --> 33:14.534
before she was killed,
so most likely we're looking

33:14.617 --> 33:16.744
for a house with a detached garage
or a shed.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.954
We need to narrow this down,

33:18.037 --> 33:20.331
because this is Palm Acres.
The houses have houses.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.041
Yeah, well, at the time
of Elena's autopsy,

33:22.125 --> 33:24.502
the ME found cuprous oxide
in Elena's clothes.

33:24.585 --> 33:26.629
It's a pigment from a ceramic glaze.

33:26.713 --> 33:27.839
Elena was in an art class.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.465
Yeah, but it didn't have to come
from art class.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.801
Cuprous oxide is also used
in semiconductors.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.178
-It's used in fungicides.
-Anti-fouling paint.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.473
I use it on my boat to keep
the barnacles off the hull.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.891
Wait a minute.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.399
-The boathouse.
-The boathouse.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.987
This has to be where Elena was killed.

33:51.612 --> 33:52.905
There's the anti-fouling paint,

33:52.989 --> 33:54.824
and doesn't this rope look familiar?

33:55.616 --> 33:58.244
Yep, it's the type of rope
used to strangle those girls.

33:58.327 --> 34:00.246
Okay, use the luminol
to search for traces of blood.

34:00.329 --> 34:02.498
Swab, scrape, and process anything
that could point to the killer.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.916
- Yep.
- Rosie

34:04.250 --> 34:05.626
Check out the class of '04.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.129
We need to get to Michelle.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.547
Whoa, whoa, Michelle?

34:10.006 --> 34:11.340
Mom is with her right now.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.509
That means she's with our killer.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.681
I'm not surprised
he got you to trust him.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.975
My father can be very charming
when he wants.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.519
Charming, yes, but a killer?

34:24.437 --> 34:26.856
Would your father have taken
these girls into a bunker?

34:27.690 --> 34:30.234
Would he have strangled her,
stabbed her?

34:30.401 --> 34:32.445
When Misty was found,
she had blood on her jeans.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.405
Now, the police said
it was your father's blood.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.364
It's mine.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.742
Yes, I know it's yours,

34:37.825 --> 34:40.328
but how did your blood
get on her jeans?

34:40.411 --> 34:42.413
No, these are my jeans.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.415
But Misty was wearing my jeans,

34:44.499 --> 34:46.834
and Elena was wearing my jewelry.

34:48.544 --> 34:49.962
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.006
Well, someone must have given
my things to them.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.926
My father didn't know
about the bunker,

34:55.301 --> 34:56.385
but I did.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.473
We need to leave.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.808
-Michelle?
-No, now.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.226
You're not going anywhere.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.906
Drop the weapon and put your hands up!

35:17.573 --> 35:20.451
- Mom, are you okay?
- Let her go, or I'll shoot.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.624
No, Villa! It's gas.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.253
Michelle, everything is gonna be okay.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.798
Harley, let's talk this out.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.217
Villa, we need to stall.

35:36.801 --> 35:37.927
-What?
-Trust me.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.512
You made me believe it was my father,

35:39.595 --> 35:41.597
-but it was you.
-Shut up!

35:42.390 --> 35:43.724
I did everything for you.

35:44.350 --> 35:46.727
I protected you.
I gave you a new life.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.272
-You destroyed my life.
-Let her go.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.607
Just let her go.

35:52.191 --> 35:53.901
And you and me can figure this out.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.865
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do,
Detective?

35:58.948 --> 36:01.367
Fire that gun? One little spark--

36:01.450 --> 36:03.494
Okay, Harley, listen to me.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.871
It doesn't have to end this way.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.205
Yeah, I'm not going to prison.

36:06.706 --> 36:09.959
All right, can we just talk about
how smart you are?

36:10.042 --> 36:11.210
I mean,

36:11.294 --> 36:12.837
that's a clever place
to hide a murder weapon.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.755
Right? In plain sight.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.759
It's kind of like a reminder
of your accomplishments.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.721
Like those trophies you got
from the crew team.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.264
Don't come any closer.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.892
That's where you killed Elena,
isn't it?

36:26.309 --> 36:27.435
She died in the off season,

36:27.518 --> 36:29.061
when you had the boathouse
to yourself.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.023
Then you got rid of everybody
who was trying to hurt Michelle.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.192
I had to stop them.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.944
But who's gonna stop you?

36:41.407 --> 36:42.450
No one.

36:43.117 --> 36:44.869
I don't care if we all die right here.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.454
Go ahead.

36:54.795 --> 36:55.963
Rosewood!

36:58.841 --> 37:00.343
Rosie, how did you know?

37:00.426 --> 37:02.595
Well, it was easy. I calculated
the volume of the room,

37:02.678 --> 37:04.513
how much cubic feet of gas
it took to fill the room,

37:04.597 --> 37:06.015
and then how much gas was escaping--

37:06.098 --> 37:07.225
All right, yeah, I got it.
I got it.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.809
-I told you to trust me.
-Oh, dear God.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.978
Hey, you guys okay? You okay?

37:17.568 --> 37:19.612
Put that sludge down.
I brought you the good stuff.

37:20.738 --> 37:21.906
Thank you.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.115
You're welcome.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.742
I know I owe you a real date.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.744
You know what? You do. You do.

37:26.827 --> 37:28.996
And I was thinking...

37:34.710 --> 37:36.545
La Boheme? The opera?

37:36.629 --> 37:38.839
-Yeah.
-What?

37:38.923 --> 37:40.174
It's a Moonstruck reference.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.717
It's the greatest Rom-com of all time.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.094
Cher at her best.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.472
Okay, yes, I enjoy the opera.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.140
And Rom-coms.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.308
And Cher.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.019
You know, and I cry at sports movies.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.271
You know, all of them. All right?

37:53.354 --> 37:55.189
If there's a game being played
and someone wins or loses,

37:55.273 --> 37:57.358
maybe learns a lesson or two
along the way, it's...

37:57.733 --> 37:59.068
Waterworks. I can't help it.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.529
I don't want to.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.030
And I'm a cat guy.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.117
And, well, I live at home
with my mother,

38:06.742 --> 38:07.827
because she's sick.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.913
It's early-onset Alzheimer's.

38:11.872 --> 38:12.999
I am so sorry.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.251
No, it's okay. It's okay.

38:16.877 --> 38:20.131
All right, well, so now that
I've shared all of my red flags, um...

38:20.214 --> 38:22.383
you want to go to the opera with me,

38:22.466 --> 38:24.010
maybe start a little
Rom-com of our own?

38:24.093 --> 38:27.013
You know, I got to go, but can we...

38:27.096 --> 38:29.223
Just think about it. Don't answer now.

38:29.807 --> 38:30.641
All right?

38:30.808 --> 38:32.435
I will be there.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.729
Saturday, 7:30 sharp.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.647
Hey.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.941
I live with my mother, too.

38:47.992 --> 38:48.993
- There he is.
- There he is.

38:49.160 --> 38:49.994
Harley. Harley.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.330
Gerald's friends in prison
will take good care of him.

38:52.413 --> 38:55.124
Yeah, hopefully, 'cause he's not gonna
see the light of day for a while.

38:55.207 --> 38:56.417
Hopefully Gerald will.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.712
Harley, why did you
murder those two girls?

38:59.795 --> 39:01.547
Did you really think
you could get away with it?

39:02.840 --> 39:03.758
Gun!

39:11.891 --> 39:14.518
- Get on the ground right now!
- Place the gun on the floor!

39:16.520 --> 39:17.897
Villa, get that gun.

39:22.568 --> 39:23.569
Get up.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.748
You finally get some sleep?

39:36.207 --> 39:38.125
I did. No more nightmares.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.755
I want to be happier
that a murderer is dead

39:42.838 --> 39:44.632
and off the streets, but I'm not.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.927
Maybe it's 'cause the guy
who killed him

39:48.010 --> 39:49.303
gets a free plane ride home.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.556
Diplomatic immunity.
He'll be tried in Panama.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.433
He's their problem now.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.851
The good thing is,

39:56.352 --> 39:57.770
an innocent man gets to go free.
