WEBVTT

01:45.962 --> 01:48.930
Oh, shit. Hey. Hey.
What's... What's this all about?

01:48.932 --> 01:51.532
Hey. Whoa.
This is about Randall, isn't it?

01:51.534 --> 01:53.335
Randall Graves?
I could take you to him.

01:53.337 --> 01:54.469
Seriously, I can.

01:54.471 --> 01:56.506
Listen, guys, I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

01:56.939 --> 01:59.374
One out
of twelve. One out of twelve.

01:59.376 --> 02:00.675
- Gun.
- Stand-by,

02:00.677 --> 02:03.744
suspects operating
illegal marijuana dispensary

02:03.746 --> 02:05.981
inside baked chicken
sandwich store.

02:05.983 --> 02:07.716
I love this shit.

02:07.718 --> 02:10.051
I finally get to arrest
these motherfuckers.

02:21.799 --> 02:23.764
All right, you motherfuckers.

02:23.766 --> 02:27.401
I know you're in there.
Come out right now.

02:27.403 --> 02:28.406
- Yeah.
- Woo.

02:39.983 --> 02:42.451
This is
the Leonardo Police Department.

02:42.453 --> 02:43.285
You're under arrest

02:43.287 --> 02:44.953
for suspicion
of drug trafficking.

02:44.955 --> 02:46.924
Drop your plants now.

02:48.891 --> 02:51.596
I said
drop the motherfucking plants!

02:53.563 --> 02:55.566
I'm the boss.
He did what the fuck I said.

02:58.836 --> 03:01.803
What the...
I said plants, not pants.

03:01.805 --> 03:03.804
- There's nothing there, man.
- That is a white dude.

03:03.806 --> 03:06.441
- What the fuck do you expect?
- There's nothing there!

03:06.443 --> 03:07.909
What the fuck, Sarge?

03:07.911 --> 03:09.678
This son of a bitch
doesn't have a dick.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.582
He's got a fucking dick.
He just got it tucked in.

03:13.584 --> 03:14.916
All right, Buffalo Bill.

03:14.918 --> 03:17.388
Where's your buddy?
Mr. Silence of the Lambs.

03:23.159 --> 03:26.460
Identify yourselves,
motherfuckers!

03:26.462 --> 03:31.066
I'm Jay and this is
my hetero lifemate, Silent Bob.

03:31.068 --> 03:34.970
♪ Good-bye horses ♪

03:34.972 --> 03:41.646
♪ I'm flying, flying,
Flying over you ♪

03:48.419 --> 03:49.754
Home sweet home, right?

03:53.856 --> 03:57.995
Everyone say,
"Yay, it's Jay and Silent Bob."

03:58.594 --> 04:02.596
- Well, just look at you two.
- Who the fuck are you?

04:02.598 --> 04:04.733
I'm your lawyer.
That's who the fuck I am.

04:04.735 --> 04:06.935
Did anybody ever tell you
how a courtroom works?

04:06.937 --> 04:09.137
Okay.
In the criminal justice system,

04:09.139 --> 04:10.805
the people are represented
by two separate

04:10.807 --> 04:12.473
yet equally important groups.

04:12.475 --> 04:14.542
Dude, we've seen
all the Law & Orders.

04:14.544 --> 04:17.178
Oh, me too.
Dick Wolf is a genius.

04:17.180 --> 04:18.880
I just love all of his shows
so much.

04:18.882 --> 04:22.487
In fact, my Grindr name is
Dick Wolfer. Remember that.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.553
Oh, I almost forgot.
Before I represent you,

04:25.555 --> 04:27.925
I'm gonna need you to sign
these legal documents.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.459
What? Read it first?

04:31.461 --> 04:33.627
I mean, come on.
Who cares what that shit says?

04:33.629 --> 04:34.632
Just sign it.

04:35.531 --> 04:36.533
Yeah.

04:41.038 --> 04:44.738
I can't believe that worked.
Well, perfection.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.640
I hope you're both prepared
to go home today,

04:46.642 --> 04:49.144
because I am the best lawyer
in showbiz.

04:49.146 --> 04:50.711
Seriously,
I'm like the Dick Wolf

04:50.713 --> 04:52.613
of getting guys off
with my mouth.

04:52.615 --> 04:56.517
But that's why you hired me,
am I right? Or am I wrong?

04:56.519 --> 04:57.952
But we didn't hire you.

04:57.954 --> 05:00.056
- Small formality.
- All rise.

05:06.963 --> 05:09.466
Thank you. Be seated.

05:10.901 --> 05:14.536
Docket number 37,
People v. Jay and Silent Bob.

05:14.538 --> 05:15.872
Jay and Silent Bob are back?

05:18.242 --> 05:19.608
Charges are drug trafficking

05:19.610 --> 05:21.675
and running an illegal
drug dispensary

05:21.677 --> 05:23.747
disguised as a
chicken sandwich shop called...

05:27.317 --> 05:28.750
...Cock Smoker.

05:31.555 --> 05:32.557
Hello, boys.

05:33.057 --> 05:35.656
If you two are here,
it must be a weekday,

05:35.658 --> 05:37.558
but this isn't a court
appointed attorney.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.229
I spy one of those lawyers
you have to pay.

05:39.663 --> 05:41.962
How do your clients plead,
Counselor?

05:44.100 --> 05:45.202
Not guilty, Your Honor.

05:46.168 --> 05:47.971
I guess the weed grew itself.

05:48.872 --> 05:49.874
People on bail?

05:50.607 --> 05:51.572
Hey, Jerry.

05:51.574 --> 05:54.743
- How you doing?
- So we the people would hope

05:54.745 --> 05:57.514
that Your Highness
would remand custody.

05:58.615 --> 05:59.714
Cool?

05:59.716 --> 06:02.017
And I imagine you see it
all differently, Counselor?

06:02.019 --> 06:03.218
The Cock Smoker was neither

06:03.220 --> 06:04.853
eatery nor dispensary,
Your Honor.

06:04.855 --> 06:06.691
It was merely
a promotional pop-up shop.

06:07.790 --> 06:08.923
This affidavit is
from a Hollywood

06:08.925 --> 06:11.892
motion picture company
and this proves that my clients

06:11.894 --> 06:13.827
were nothing more
than paid performers

06:13.829 --> 06:15.230
for a real world
promotional stunt

06:15.232 --> 06:16.767
in support
of a forthcoming movie.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.069
- We are?
- Yes.

06:19.769 --> 06:20.471
We are.

06:20.971 --> 06:23.305
So I ask that all charges
be dropped since my clients

06:23.307 --> 06:26.074
- are so obviously innocent.
- Easy.

06:26.076 --> 06:28.043
They may be obvious
but one thing I would not call

06:28.045 --> 06:29.514
these two is innocent.

06:30.047 --> 06:33.784
But for today, at least,
they are not guilty.

06:34.350 --> 06:37.752
Jay and Silent Bob,
you're free to go.

06:37.754 --> 06:38.956
Case dismissed.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.223
Holy shit.
What the fuck just happened?

06:42.225 --> 06:45.596
I set you free, butterflies,
as promised.

06:46.262 --> 06:47.864
Remember Dick Wolfer on Grindr.

06:51.134 --> 06:52.267
Docket number 38,

06:52.269 --> 06:56.040
Hollywood motion picture company
v. Jay and Silent Bob.

06:59.242 --> 07:01.212
Who's here representing
Hollywood?

07:02.812 --> 07:03.880
I am, Your Honor.

07:05.081 --> 07:06.147
What are you doing?

07:06.149 --> 07:07.082
This is only
my second case of the day

07:07.084 --> 07:08.817
and to tell you the truth,
the whole truth,

07:08.819 --> 07:10.050
and nothing but the truth...

07:10.052 --> 07:12.187
...I already need
a fucking drink. Jesus.

07:12.189 --> 07:13.721
Can we get this going,
Counselor?

07:13.723 --> 07:15.656
As you can see,
I have a ton of cases

07:15.658 --> 07:17.127
that we need
to get through today.

07:19.329 --> 07:21.665
Absolutely, Your Honor.

07:22.132 --> 07:24.568
Your Honor, my client,
Saban Films,

07:25.002 --> 07:26.935
is seeking an injunction
against the defendants

07:26.937 --> 07:28.670
for copyright infringement

07:28.672 --> 07:32.106
of the trademarked intellectual
property Jay and Silent Bob.

07:32.108 --> 07:33.808
Yo, this guy's lying,
Your Honor.

07:33.810 --> 07:35.709
Me and Silent Bob
don't own any property.

07:35.711 --> 07:38.312
We've never been intellectual
about anything.

07:38.314 --> 07:40.350
Have your mouth take a knee.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.250
Saban Films.

07:43.252 --> 07:45.120
Didn't they make the
Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers?

07:45.122 --> 07:47.022
Oh, man. You ever see the one
where the red ranger

07:47.024 --> 07:48.288
turns into the gold ranger?

07:48.290 --> 07:50.925
- Dope.
- That was years ago, Your Honor.

07:50.927 --> 07:52.793
Now they're more
of a multimedia company.

07:52.795 --> 07:56.397
Oh. Does the multimedia combine
into a giant Megazord?

07:56.399 --> 07:57.598
Oh, shit.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.338
- ♪ Go, Power Rangers ♪
- Deep cuts, Your Honor.

08:00.771 --> 08:04.339
Anyhoo, last year, Saban Films
acquired worldwide rights

08:04.341 --> 08:07.074
to the campy old
Bluntman and Chronic movie

08:07.076 --> 08:11.983
- for about $3,700 on Craigslist.
- They overpaid.

08:12.415 --> 08:16.183
So, now, all the underlying
rights belong to my client,

08:16.185 --> 08:18.322
including,
not only the titular characters,

08:18.822 --> 08:21.792
but their supporting
secret identities as well,

08:22.492 --> 08:26.394
the registered trademarks
of Jay and Silent Bob.

08:26.396 --> 08:30.067
Ergo, Your Honor,
Saban Films owns their names.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.067
What?

08:32.068 --> 08:34.736
I said Saban Films owns
your names.

08:34.738 --> 08:37.905
Is there any paperwork to back
up a claim this wild, Counselor?

08:37.908 --> 08:39.110
Oh, yes, Your Honor.

08:39.844 --> 08:42.243
I present contracts signed
by the defendants

08:42.245 --> 08:45.079
giving Saban Films
total discretionary control

08:45.081 --> 08:47.081
over the names
Jay and Silent Bob.

08:47.083 --> 08:48.785
That's the paper we just signed?

08:50.052 --> 08:51.688
Will the defendants please rise?

08:53.289 --> 08:54.891
Oh, shit. We're the defendants?

08:55.325 --> 08:59.326
This document confirms that
Saban Films does indeed own

08:59.328 --> 09:02.162
the 2001 movie
Bluntman and Chronic.

09:02.164 --> 09:05.032
What? That old ass star-studded
piece of shit?

09:05.034 --> 09:07.301
That movie sucked balls.

09:07.303 --> 09:09.804
Not just balls.
It sucked asshole too.

09:09.806 --> 09:11.506
Your Honor, I object.

09:11.508 --> 09:14.776
I'll allow it. That movie did
suck balls and asshole.

09:14.778 --> 09:18.179
Jay and Silent Bob, you are
hereby legally prohibited

09:18.181 --> 09:21.882
from calling yourselves
Jay and Silent Bob ever again.

09:23.186 --> 09:25.887
You're out of order!
You're out of order!

09:25.889 --> 09:28.922
This whole fucking court's
out of order!

09:28.924 --> 09:29.993
Somebody wants an Oscar.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.869
Why'd you move your store
to the mall?

09:41.871 --> 09:43.807
Because apparently,
I wanted to be alone...

09:44.541 --> 09:45.743
Snoogans.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.876
Nah, rent's just cheaper here,

09:47.878 --> 09:50.545
on account of
the mall is slowly dying.

09:50.547 --> 09:53.147
The old girl's
on her last legs, boys.

09:53.149 --> 09:55.819
So much so that you got to
watch out for all the mall rats.

09:56.886 --> 09:58.386
I... I didn't see any kids here.

09:58.388 --> 10:00.988
No, I mean the actual rats
we got running around

10:00.990 --> 10:02.956
this abandoned shithole
of a mall.

10:02.958 --> 10:04.025
Hit the deck, boys.

10:05.595 --> 10:06.964
Let me get this straight...

10:07.798 --> 10:10.964
you guys got busted for running
an illegal pot shop

10:10.966 --> 10:13.200
inside a fake
chicken sandwich store

10:13.202 --> 10:16.204
and the Hollywood lawyer
you didn't hire got you off,

10:16.206 --> 10:18.272
but then he somehow stole
your names?

10:18.274 --> 10:21.475
And then the cops stole the weed
we were working out for years.

10:21.477 --> 10:24.145
And all we got left
from the best bud in the world

10:24.147 --> 10:26.314
are these three joints
right here

10:26.316 --> 10:29.584
made from the flower of one
of the three strains of gold.

10:29.586 --> 10:32.020
Huh. I knew you guys
were weed dealers,

10:32.022 --> 10:34.088
but I never knew you were
weed growers.

10:34.090 --> 10:35.055
Oh, we learned to grow

10:35.057 --> 10:37.525
from watching our favorite movie
of all time,

10:37.527 --> 10:39.326
How High with Method and Redman.

10:39.328 --> 10:41.595
They're like the black Jay
and Silent Bob.

10:41.597 --> 10:45.300
Holy shit.
You guys still rent DVDs?

10:45.302 --> 10:46.903
Never heard
of Netflix and chill?

10:47.671 --> 10:49.938
One time we Hulu and humped,
right?

10:49.940 --> 10:52.239
But most nights,
we Redbox and jerk off.

10:52.241 --> 10:54.077
So, how are you feeling
about being busted?

10:55.211 --> 10:57.377
♪ The car to drive
What to drink ♪

10:57.379 --> 10:59.546
♪ Ignorant bliss
No need to think ♪

10:59.548 --> 11:02.150
♪ As Barb cakes fetus
On her face ♪

11:02.152 --> 11:04.352
♪ Ken sucks blood
At his workplace... ♪

11:05.522 --> 11:06.954
♪ They take from me... ♪

11:06.956 --> 11:07.957
LOL.

11:09.592 --> 11:11.425
And on top of that,
the judge told us

11:11.427 --> 11:13.060
we weren't even legally allowed

11:13.062 --> 11:15.396
to be Jay
and Silent Bob no more,

11:15.398 --> 11:19.003
because our names were bought by
some assholes from Sbarro films.

11:19.535 --> 11:23.137
- You mean Sbarro's?
- Yeah, those pizza-making fucks!

11:23.139 --> 11:26.907
All because of some stupid movie
that was made 20 years ago.

11:26.909 --> 11:29.042
It's like,
"Come on already, move on.

11:29.044 --> 11:31.112
The dishes are done, man."

11:31.114 --> 11:33.113
Don't Tell Mom
The Babysitter's Dead.

11:33.115 --> 11:35.351
- A Keith Coogan classic.
- Snoogans.

11:35.818 --> 11:39.119
Well, you know, fellas,
I think your legal woes

11:39.121 --> 11:41.189
have less to do
with the stupid old movie

11:41.191 --> 11:43.291
that came out 20 years ago,

11:43.293 --> 11:46.994
and more to do with the stupid
new movie that's coming soon

11:46.996 --> 11:48.164
to a theater near you.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.268
Oh, come on.

11:54.270 --> 11:56.070
Don't tell me you guys
have no idea

11:56.072 --> 11:58.138
there's a new comic book movie
being made

11:58.140 --> 12:00.974
of the old comic book movie
you two are the basis for.

12:00.976 --> 12:02.542
What, again?

12:02.544 --> 12:05.313
And look, they took away my dick
and made me a girl.

12:05.315 --> 12:09.483
I cannot believe they're gonna
remake this Bluntman bullshit.

12:09.485 --> 12:11.455
Uh, it's not a remake,
it's a reboot.

12:13.423 --> 12:15.192
What the fuck is a reboot?

12:16.259 --> 12:18.292
Well, a reboot, boys,

12:18.294 --> 12:20.228
is when Hollywood wants to make
a lot of money

12:20.230 --> 12:22.162
without the hassle of creating
a new movie,

12:22.164 --> 12:24.531
so they take an old movie
and change just enough

12:24.533 --> 12:27.267
to make you pay for
the same shit all over again.

12:27.269 --> 12:30.504
- Those greedy fucking animals.
- Oh, it's insidious.

12:30.506 --> 12:32.172
They take a flick you loved
as a kid

12:32.174 --> 12:34.208
and add youth
and diversity to it.

12:34.210 --> 12:37.210
For example, name the movie
where a robot has secret plans

12:37.212 --> 12:39.414
that could help the good guys
beat the bad guys

12:39.416 --> 12:41.281
and their leader in a black mask

12:41.283 --> 12:43.550
by blowing up a giant ray gun
in space.

12:43.552 --> 12:46.554
- Star Wars.
- No. The Force Awakens.

12:46.556 --> 12:49.393
See, now, that's what you call
a reboot. Nang.

12:50.626 --> 12:52.026
I thought that was a sequel.

12:52.028 --> 12:54.462
Hollywood doesn't make
sequels anymore.

12:54.464 --> 12:56.433
Shit, they don't even make
squeakquels, yo.

12:57.267 --> 13:00.267
Studios have given up
on new ideas entirely

13:00.269 --> 13:02.369
in favor of building
multi-movie universes

13:02.371 --> 13:05.506
that breed brand-loyal customers
from cradle to grave.

13:05.508 --> 13:08.008
So if you like Harry Potter,
cashinigus,

13:08.010 --> 13:09.544
you're getting ten fucking more.

13:09.546 --> 13:11.378
You like The Fast and Furious
flicks,

13:11.380 --> 13:14.515
we're gonna drive the franchise
into the ground, bitch.

13:14.517 --> 13:17.451
Ooh, you want another
Marvel movie, here we go.

13:17.453 --> 13:20.655
Hey, man, those Marvel movies
are a triumph of cinema.

13:20.657 --> 13:24.224
I live on those Marvel movies.
I live for those Marvel movies.

13:24.226 --> 13:26.426
I watch those Marvel movies
more than I watch Pornhub,

13:26.428 --> 13:28.363
and I cum twice as hard
doing it.

13:28.365 --> 13:31.232
- Dishes are done, man.
- Look, all I'm saying is,

13:31.234 --> 13:33.633
if Hollywood doesn't start
making some original flicks now,

13:33.635 --> 13:36.204
there's not gonna be anything
to be reboot in ten years,

13:36.206 --> 13:37.675
then they'll just be rebooting
the reboots.

13:38.107 --> 13:40.775
It's like we're reaching
point break for pop culture,

13:40.777 --> 13:42.377
and it ain't gonna be
the good Point Break

13:42.379 --> 13:45.345
with Swayz-dog and Keanu.
It's gonna be the remake.

13:45.347 --> 13:48.549
Wait. What's the difference
between a reboot and a remake?

13:48.551 --> 13:50.184
Well, I'm glad you asked, Jay,

13:50.186 --> 13:52.786
because a remake is like
a reboot where the studio

13:52.788 --> 13:55.555
doesn't care how the audience
feels about the original movie,

13:55.557 --> 13:58.258
so, they just keep the title,
fuck up everything else,

13:58.260 --> 14:00.663
and ruin both flicks
in the process, see?

14:01.398 --> 14:04.531
Which is probably what
Bluntman v Chronic is gonna be,

14:04.533 --> 14:07.602
because the director of this
impending abortion of cinema

14:07.604 --> 14:10.206
is none other than
Kevin fucking Smith.

14:11.541 --> 14:13.708
- Who?
- You know, the guy who directed

14:13.710 --> 14:15.675
that Bruce Willis winner,
Cop Out.

14:15.677 --> 14:16.810
That queef.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.647
They still let him make movies
after that walrus shit?

14:19.649 --> 14:21.214
What can I tell you,
in Hollywood,

14:21.216 --> 14:22.517
people fail upwards.

14:22.519 --> 14:24.618
I fucking hate
stupid Kevin Smith,

14:24.620 --> 14:27.557
first, he took away our names,
then he took away my dick.

14:27.990 --> 14:30.190
Well, we gotta stop
stupid Kevin Smith

14:30.192 --> 14:31.559
from making another shitty movie

14:31.561 --> 14:34.262
about Jay
and Silent Bob ever again.

14:34.264 --> 14:37.000
Well, then, youse guys better
get your asses to Chronic-Con.

14:39.101 --> 14:41.768
- And what the fuck is this shit?
- Chronic-Con,

14:41.770 --> 14:44.539
when it started out, it was
a homegrown fanfest for people

14:44.541 --> 14:47.208
who love that campy old
Bluntman and Chronic movie

14:47.210 --> 14:49.079
with Jason Biggs
and James Van Der Beek.

14:49.578 --> 14:52.546
Those guys, I saw them bitches
get beat up by a monkey.

14:52.548 --> 14:54.147
But now, Chronic-Con's morphed

14:54.149 --> 14:56.117
into an annual
pop culture convention.

14:56.119 --> 14:57.752
I don't know how you guys would
even get in at this point.

14:57.754 --> 14:58.953
Tickets are already sold-out.

14:58.955 --> 15:02.355
Sold-out? After all these years,
what kind of broken fucks

15:02.357 --> 15:05.628
still wanna watch this Jay
and Silent Bob bullshit anyway?

15:11.267 --> 15:13.267
Well, enough to run
an Omaze auction

15:13.269 --> 15:14.638
for a cameo in the reboot.

15:16.339 --> 15:18.442
Hey, man, it's me, Kevin Smith.

15:18.875 --> 15:19.643
You know, the filmmaker...

15:20.177 --> 15:24.112
Look at this ugly motherfucker,
probably got a tiny dick too.

15:24.114 --> 15:26.280
Now, I got some big news
for you, man,

15:26.282 --> 15:30.383
we are shooting a key sequence
to Bluntman v Chronic

15:30.385 --> 15:33.186
at this year's Chronic-Con, man.

15:33.188 --> 15:34.722
This scene is so important.

15:34.724 --> 15:38.126
We cannot finish this movie
without it.

15:38.128 --> 15:41.128
So enter right now
and maybe I'll see you

15:41.130 --> 15:43.733
this Friday in Hollywood.

15:45.735 --> 15:47.236
Would you fucking stop?

15:47.669 --> 15:48.768
Dick.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.638
Hollywood,
where we struck back, yo.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.374
Oh, you will never find
a more wretched hive

15:54.376 --> 15:55.709
of scum and villainy.

15:55.711 --> 15:58.378
But that “director” just said
they couldn't finish the movie

15:58.380 --> 16:00.781
without the scene they're
shooting at this Chronic-Con.

16:00.783 --> 16:02.816
So all we got to do is get
to Hollywood,

16:02.818 --> 16:04.852
stop him from shooting
that scene and biggity bam,

16:04.854 --> 16:06.786
Kevin James can't finish
the movie.

16:06.788 --> 16:08.555
Ke... Never mind.

16:08.557 --> 16:10.324
We got three days to get
to Chronic-Con,

16:10.326 --> 16:13.560
take our names back, rescue
my dick from Kevin James

16:13.562 --> 16:16.196
and stop this reboot
from ever happening.

16:16.198 --> 16:19.499
Come on, Silent Bob,
we're going back to Hollywood.

16:19.501 --> 16:21.604
And on that note,
we cue the music.

16:33.615 --> 16:35.119
Have a great flight.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.720
Hi, there.
Welcome to Southbest Airlines.

16:40.722 --> 16:42.323
How can I help y'all?

16:42.325 --> 16:44.724
“Y'all”? What kind
of Jersey accent is that?

16:44.726 --> 16:46.526
I'm from South Jersey.

16:46.528 --> 16:48.396
Now, what can I do for y'all?

16:48.398 --> 16:49.863
Two tickets to Hollywood.

16:49.865 --> 16:53.370
In coach, I'm assuming.

16:55.337 --> 16:57.841
That'll be 337 a piece, boys.

17:04.780 --> 17:05.781
Oh.

17:06.950 --> 17:09.353
How about we start
with y'all's names?

17:11.653 --> 17:15.222
I am Don Juan Dela Nooch.

17:16.358 --> 17:21.661
And this is
Senor Roberto Silencio.

17:21.663 --> 17:23.430
Those names sound
kind of made-up.

17:23.432 --> 17:26.467
Listen, lady, our real names
are Jay and Silent Bob,

17:26.469 --> 17:27.734
- but this morning...
- Yeah.

17:27.737 --> 17:30.403
...Kevin James,
The King of fucking Queens,

17:30.405 --> 17:31.738
stole those names.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.241
I can't book y'all under your
fake names,

17:34.243 --> 17:37.580
so why don't I try
Jay and Silent Bob,

17:38.181 --> 17:40.417
which also sound
like fake names, I might add.

17:42.551 --> 17:45.253
Ooh, sorry, boys,

17:45.255 --> 17:48.926
but it says here that you got
a wait problem.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.561
- Weight problem?
- Mm-hmm.

17:53.563 --> 17:55.930
Are you saying
he's still too fat to fly?

17:55.932 --> 17:58.532
Are you fucking blind
as Anne Frank?

17:58.534 --> 18:01.434
Silent Bob lost a bunch
of weight, lady.

18:01.436 --> 18:05.538
He went all vegan and shit,
eating that v-gina.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.807
- That's not right.
- I used to call him lunch box,

18:07.809 --> 18:10.277
but now I have to call him
snack pack.

18:10.279 --> 18:12.646
I used to say,
"Fly, fat ass. Fly."

18:12.648 --> 18:15.650
Now I have to say,
"Fly, low-fat ass. Fly."

18:15.652 --> 18:17.384
Let me make something
straight here,

18:17.386 --> 18:19.987
I said, "Wait problem."

18:19.989 --> 18:26.693
And the... problem is
that y'all can't fly,

18:26.695 --> 18:28.531
because ya are
on the No-Fly List.

18:30.599 --> 18:33.700
There is something here about
a terrorist organization

18:33.702 --> 18:36.671
- called The Clit.
- The Clit's not real.

18:36.673 --> 18:38.608
Says every guy I ever dated.

18:39.108 --> 18:41.574
I'm sorry, but y'all can't fly,

18:41.576 --> 18:43.344
because y'all are
on the No-Fly List,

18:43.346 --> 18:44.444
but you know what you could do,

18:44.446 --> 18:45.781
maybe you could
Ride Me Now instead.

18:48.084 --> 18:49.350
Ride you now?

18:49.352 --> 18:52.420
Ride Me Now is a ride-share app.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.555
So you just do one click

18:54.557 --> 18:57.857
and Ride Me Now
will send you a car

18:57.859 --> 19:00.494
and that car will take y'all
wherever y'all wanna go.

19:00.496 --> 19:01.895
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:01.897 --> 19:04.498
Well then, fuck your planes,
Joline.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.836
Okay. Bye-bye.

19:07.002 --> 19:08.371
Go fuck yourself.

19:15.510 --> 19:18.315
The app needs a credit card?
Dude, what are we gonna do?

19:19.048 --> 19:21.114
You know what you do,
you go fuck yourself,

19:21.116 --> 19:22.418
that's what you do.

19:23.185 --> 19:26.620
No. You listen to me,
you call center Khalifa,

19:26.622 --> 19:29.623
the dummy at the counter
couldn't find my reservation,

19:29.625 --> 19:31.691
that's why you're gonna find
my reservation

19:31.693 --> 19:33.861
or I'm gonna have
the both of you fired.

19:33.863 --> 19:36.430
Someone should teach
that motherfucker a lesson.

19:36.432 --> 19:38.865
All right. I'm gonna give you
the credit card number again.

19:38.867 --> 19:41.000
I'm gonna read it so slowly

19:41.002 --> 19:44.671
and out loud in public so that
you will understand.

19:44.673 --> 19:47.543
All right. The name
is Ted Underhill.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.378
Not Ed, Ted.

19:50.380 --> 19:51.615
T... T... T... T.

19:53.449 --> 19:55.619
And the number is nine...

19:57.487 --> 19:58.488
five...

19:58.954 --> 20:00.153
eight...

20:00.155 --> 20:01.090
four...

20:07.563 --> 20:08.696
Ted Underhill?

20:08.698 --> 20:13.066
Yo,
I'm Ted motherfucking Underhill.

20:18.807 --> 20:21.475
Wait. You wanna smoke
one of those unicorns now?

20:21.477 --> 20:23.177
Dude, we only got
three left, man.

20:23.179 --> 20:25.813
And after we smoke them,
they're gone forever.

20:25.815 --> 20:28.047
Let's save them
for a special occasion.

20:28.049 --> 20:32.722
I say we smoke
this little bitch.

20:33.155 --> 20:34.357
Ooh.

20:35.057 --> 20:38.159
Oh, come on, man.
I roll a perfect Silent Bob

20:38.161 --> 20:39.927
and you're pissed about it?

20:39.929 --> 20:42.065
This motherfucker belongs
in a museum, son.

20:43.432 --> 20:44.433
Light it up.

20:54.743 --> 20:57.478
I'm almost glad you guys
are smoking back there.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.580
I was driving someone
about a week ago

20:59.582 --> 21:03.150
and he took a, uh, big shit
in the back seat.

21:03.152 --> 21:06.123
I had no idea until the next
passenger found it.

21:06.855 --> 21:08.057
It was everywhere.

21:08.657 --> 21:10.092
You have no idea how hard it is

21:11.124 --> 21:11.994
to get the smell of shit
out of pleather.

21:12.428 --> 21:15.499
I mean, it just stays there,
really, it's like a ghost.

21:16.098 --> 21:18.968
You guys are my first two
passengers since that big shit.

21:19.769 --> 21:22.001
I'm your driver by the way,
Todd Merkinsky.

21:22.003 --> 21:23.603
Nice to meet you.

21:23.605 --> 21:27.074
Oh, Merkinsky.
I will call you Merkin.

21:29.111 --> 21:30.209
Todd would be better.

21:30.211 --> 21:32.880
Why does your car smell like
French fries, Merkin?

21:32.882 --> 21:36.019
Because in my car, guess what
I have instead of gum,

21:36.885 --> 21:39.987
I have tater tots.
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

21:39.989 --> 21:42.021
You got tater tots up
in this bitch,

21:42.023 --> 21:43.157
where you'd get them?

21:43.159 --> 21:46.059
Well, I'm a businessman,
an entrepreneur,

21:46.061 --> 21:51.097
and, uh, I had a business idea,
teen girls love tater tots.

21:51.099 --> 21:54.136
So I came up with Hater Totz.

21:54.703 --> 21:56.937
Got a little, uh, quiz on there,

21:56.939 --> 21:58.808
you know, is your BFF
really the bezt

21:59.241 --> 22:01.542
and it's kind of like a,
I don't know,

22:01.544 --> 22:03.113
TigerBeat
on a box of tater tots.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.179
And those tween girls,

22:05.181 --> 22:07.515
they still love that TigerBeat,
right?

22:07.517 --> 22:08.882
Right?

22:08.884 --> 22:10.953
I'm wrong. I was very wrong.

22:11.421 --> 22:14.721
Hater Totz means different
things to different people.

22:14.723 --> 22:16.257
What do I mean by that?

22:16.259 --> 22:20.227
Well, Hater Totz started
attracting a customer base

22:20.229 --> 22:23.133
I never wanted or asked for...

22:24.567 --> 22:25.900
white nationalists.

22:25.902 --> 22:28.038
Can you believe it?
How did they even hear about it?

22:28.671 --> 22:32.174
So, I shut down. I just declared
bankruptcy and now, well...

22:32.909 --> 22:35.843
I serve these leftover
tater tots to all my riders,

22:35.845 --> 22:38.011
F-O-C, free of charge.

22:38.013 --> 22:40.014
Take as many tater tots
as you want,

22:40.016 --> 22:42.615
eat all the tater tots you take.

22:42.617 --> 22:44.951
By the way, I don't know
if my app is wrong,

22:44.953 --> 22:48.188
but, uh, it says here you're
supposed to go to Hollywood?

22:48.190 --> 22:50.824
All right. That's very,
very far. I'll make you a deal.

22:50.826 --> 22:53.893
I'll drive you all the way
to Hollywood, California.

22:53.895 --> 22:57.030
You give me a big tip
and some amazing feedback.

22:57.032 --> 23:01.634
Deal-io Emilio.
Now, drive, Miss Daisy. Drive.

23:01.636 --> 23:03.606
All right. Here we go.
Hollywood.

23:08.743 --> 23:10.911
Hi. Remember me?

23:10.913 --> 23:13.884
I'm Loki, the Angel of Death
from Dogma.

23:14.617 --> 23:16.850
Now, if your kids are looking
at you right now like,

23:16.852 --> 23:18.051
"That's not Tom Hiddleston,"

23:18.053 --> 23:21.255
just tell them I was Loki
in the '90s, before it was cool.

23:21.257 --> 23:23.527
And I did it
without the fake British accent.

23:24.027 --> 23:26.960
Anyway, for 20 years now
people ask,

23:26.962 --> 23:29.129
"What happened to Loki
at the end of Dogma?

23:29.131 --> 23:30.200
Did he go to hell?”

23:31.299 --> 23:32.568
Heavens no.

23:33.201 --> 23:35.936
Pun intended. But I did almost
unmake existence,

23:35.938 --> 23:39.172
so as punishment, God, who looks
exactly like Alanis Morissette,

23:39.174 --> 23:42.109
banished me to life on earth
again,

23:42.111 --> 23:45.011
but not Wisconsin this time.
Thank, Christ. No.

23:45.013 --> 23:47.648
God dropped me
in the Mediterranean Sea

23:47.650 --> 23:49.753
where I was rescued
by Italian fisherman.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.751
I didn't even know
who I was anymore.

23:51.753 --> 23:53.152
I had total amnesia.

23:53.154 --> 23:55.189
So, after the events of Dogma,

23:55.191 --> 23:57.891
I guess you could say
I was born again.

23:57.893 --> 23:59.930

at now is...

24:01.130 --> 24:05.065

Jay, you're a great guy

33:36.305 --> 33:38.207
and you have
a million-dollar heart.

33:38.874 --> 33:42.745
A nickel head,
but a million-dollar heart.

33:43.644 --> 33:47.413
All you ever needed in life
was Silent Bob and...

33:47.415 --> 33:49.417
...a good bag of weed.

33:50.751 --> 33:54.389
But a baby needs a home

33:55.257 --> 33:56.726
I'm stable as a table.

33:57.393 --> 34:01.594

34:01.596 --> 34:03.596
Me and Silent Bob are going
to Hollywood

34:03.598 --> 34:06.568

34:15.244 --> 34:17.446
But if I'm being honest here...

34:18.880 --> 34:21.918
uh, I really don't think
you're dad material.

34:28.989 --> 34:33.025
But you're here now,
so maybe you should meet

34:33.027 --> 34:35.697
the little girl who knocked
you out and tied you up.

34:39.034 --> 34:41.568
I've always said her dad
took off before she was born,

34:41.570 --> 34:43.536
so she'll have no idea
you two are related.

34:43.538 --> 34:44.670
And I want it to stay that way,

34:44.672 --> 34:47.306
so you can never tell her
who you really are, okay?

34:47.309 --> 34:49.946
You gotta promise me
you won't say anything.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.415
What are you telling me for?
He's the one with the big mouth.

34:54.849 --> 34:57.752
Brace yourself. You're about
to meet our love child.

35:04.592 --> 35:08.561
Uh, I think I'm gonna need
to see a blood test.

35:08.563 --> 35:09.565
Hello.

35:10.731 --> 35:13.032
Mom, I told you
to leave these meth heads

35:13.034 --> 35:14.703
tied up until the cops got here.

35:15.469 --> 35:16.471
Okay.

35:16.972 --> 35:17.903
I didn't call the cops

35:17.905 --> 35:19.972
and these guys
are not meth heads, okay?

35:19.974 --> 35:22.777

Philosophically
in a manner of speaking,

not necessarily make one a dad,

44:22.150 --> 44:23.583

44:23.585 --> 44:27.954

the fucked-up shit

44:27.956 --> 44:29.354

44:29.356 --> 44:33.425
'cause... look at you,
and do the opposite.

44:33.427 --> 44:35.894

- But I never met my own dad.

44:35.896 --> 44:37.132
But you met your kid.

44:39.166 --> 44:40.867
There you go. See?

44:40.869 --> 44:43.372
You already a better dad
than your dad ever was, bruh.

44:44.139 --> 44:48.307

and hit the road.

44:48.309 --> 44:49.976

I mean oldest man I've ever met.

45:40.460 --> 45:41.459

45:41.461 --> 45:44.229

No way. That's before they even
built the internet.

46:00.248 --> 46:02.180
knives really help a girl
make a point.

46:02.182 --> 46:04.050

wouldn't you want her

46:04.052 --> 46:05.621

46:06.054 --> 46:08.054

and she scared me

46:31.211 --> 46:33.112
Louisiana?
How long was I asleep for?

46:33.114 --> 46:35.380
- Eighteen hours straight.

46:35.382 --> 46:37.282

were strong.

46:48.628 --> 46:51.162
every interaction she hears
for her podcast,

46:51.164 --> 46:53.331
which she uses to contextualize
life in America

46:53.333 --> 46:54.532
for her audience in China.

46:54.534 --> 46:55.668
The podcast is called

46:55.670 --> 46:58.604
The American Entitled
and Their First World Problems.

46:58.606 --> 47:01.106
Shan Yu understands English,
Mr. Underhill.

47:01.108 --> 47:02.244
She just can't speak it.

47:02.744 --> 47:04.313
Kind of like you actually.

47:09.050 --> 47:11.083
Wait a minute,
where the fucks the car at?

47:11.085 --> 47:12.485
Now that there are six of us,

47:12.487 --> 47:15.021
we need a bigger whip
than Ride Me Now has,

47:15.023 --> 47:16.287
so we're gonna get a van.

47:16.289 --> 47:17.789
What are you, fucking dumb
or something?

47:17.791 --> 47:19.791
How are you gonna get a van
in the middle of nowhere?

47:19.793 --> 47:22.260
Thanks
to Operation Predator Editor.

47:25.365 --> 47:26.969
Okay, places, everybody, places.

47:42.382 --> 47:45.353
What the fuck is
Operation Predator Editor?

47:48.755 --> 47:51.289
This is
Operation Predator Editor.

47:51.291 --> 47:53.758
Phase one, Millennium
takes naked selfies.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.760
- No, she didn't.
- She did.

47:55.762 --> 47:59.597
For phase two, Millennium posts
selfies on pedophile website.

47:59.599 --> 48:02.434
- What the fuck? Why?
- For phase three,

48:02.436 --> 48:04.570
Millennium tells interested
pedophile with van

48:04.572 --> 48:06.575
to meet her
here for a free ride.

48:07.474 --> 48:08.677
Free ride?

48:11.579 --> 48:13.479
Oh, nice outfit, man.

48:13.481 --> 48:15.414
Oh, thanks, you like it?
Yeah, did you ever see

48:15.416 --> 48:16.849
- Cannonball Run?
- No.

48:16.851 --> 48:19.086
- The great Dom DeLuise?
- No.

48:19.920 --> 48:22.188
That really fell apart
right there.

48:22.190 --> 48:24.425
You're pretty flamboyant
for a pedophile.

48:28.362 --> 48:30.628
You pedophile piece of shit.

48:35.869 --> 48:37.536
What the fuck were you thinking

48:37.538 --> 48:39.572
getting in that van
with this guy?

48:39.574 --> 48:41.175
I was thinking phase four.

48:43.311 --> 48:44.809
Ted Underhill beats up
the pedophile

48:44.811 --> 48:46.080
and we take the van.

48:47.648 --> 48:50.483
♪ Is it my turn to push you... ♪

48:53.887 --> 48:56.155
All right. What if I didn't get
to the van in time?

48:56.157 --> 48:57.690
You saw what I can do
with a hockey stick.

48:57.692 --> 48:58.891
I know how to handle myself.

48:58.893 --> 49:02.327
Yeah. You grew up in a big house
in a rich kid neighborhood

49:02.329 --> 49:03.329
and went to private school.

49:03.331 --> 49:06.231
You have no idea how dangerous
people can be.

49:06.233 --> 49:07.532
So true.

49:07.534 --> 49:09.568
In Syria, a boy touched
my left nipple

49:09.570 --> 49:11.704
and told everybody
I know about that shit.

49:11.706 --> 49:14.472
I said dangerous, man.
Not bitch ass boys

49:14.474 --> 49:15.810
who got to second base.

49:16.411 --> 49:19.144
When my brother found out,
he tried to smother me

49:19.146 --> 49:21.282
in my sleep with a pillow
for shaming my family.

49:23.150 --> 49:24.518
So my mom sent me to America.

49:30.925 --> 49:32.827
You know what, fuck
your brother, all right?

49:33.327 --> 49:35.161
If the motherfucker tried
to smother me.

49:35.163 --> 49:37.632
I'd kick his ass to Asgard
where Thor lives.

49:38.498 --> 49:42.269
- No, Thor lives in my dreams.
- Mine too.

49:42.702 --> 49:46.271
Every night after I fall asleep,
I fuck Chris Hemsworth.

49:46.273 --> 49:49.407
Holy fuckhole, where did you get
such a damn dirty mouth from?

49:49.409 --> 49:51.812
I'd put my damn dirty mouth
all over Hemsworth.

49:52.847 --> 49:55.313
Yeah, and I'd be like,

49:55.315 --> 49:57.449
"Give me that Hammer,
Odin's son."

49:57.451 --> 49:59.820
Put it in my hands to see
if I'm worthy.

50:00.387 --> 50:03.424
- You guys better stop.
- Oh, I'd never stop.

50:03.858 --> 50:06.358
I'd fuck Chris Hemsworth
until I was Thor.

50:06.360 --> 50:07.562
What?

50:08.862 --> 50:11.329
Hi. Welcome to Mooby's
by the moonlight.

50:11.331 --> 50:14.168
- Six cow tippers, please.
- We're vegan, bro.

50:14.668 --> 50:17.271
I mean one cow tipper,
five milks.

50:18.239 --> 50:20.271
We're vegan, bro.

50:20.273 --> 50:21.373
Jesus, man,
just give me something

50:21.375 --> 50:23.144
with no meat, please, fuck!

50:36.289 --> 50:38.958
Can you stop being
so fucking creepy?

50:38.960 --> 50:40.025
Hey, Underhill,

50:40.027 --> 50:42.561
how about a little respect
for our guest of honor?

50:42.563 --> 50:45.731
Shan Yu is the reason we're
doing all this, Mr. Underhill.

50:45.733 --> 50:48.967
What? Operation Predator Editor?

50:48.969 --> 50:51.503
No, jackass,
that mission's over.

50:51.505 --> 50:53.338
We're onto the next mission.

50:53.340 --> 50:54.342
Oh, let me see.

50:57.378 --> 50:58.510
- Uh, no.
- You know what,

50:58.512 --> 51:01.646
you're pretty ungrateful
for someone who needed my help.

51:03.516 --> 51:04.516
Needed your help?

51:04.518 --> 51:06.651
I'm sorry,
did you seriously think

51:06.653 --> 51:09.021
we were just hoping
for two old men to drop in

51:09.023 --> 51:11.356
and ferry us to Hollywood?

51:11.358 --> 51:14.293
No, we were gonna take my mom's
car the second she left.

51:14.295 --> 51:16.394
We've been planning this mission
for months, bro.

51:16.396 --> 51:17.630
Holy shit,

51:17.632 --> 51:20.534
you girls are international
diamond thieves, aren't youse?

51:22.802 --> 51:26.838
I'm sorry, uh, diamond thieves?

51:26.840 --> 51:28.606
Yeah. When I met your mom,

51:28.608 --> 51:32.344
she told me her and her friends
were animal rights activists

51:32.346 --> 51:34.713
and then they wound up being
international diamond thieves

51:34.715 --> 51:36.684
who wore cat suits
under their clothes.

51:37.585 --> 51:39.987
Any one of you girls wearing
cat suits under your clothes?

51:41.489 --> 51:45.791
Um, okay. I don't know
anything about that,

51:45.793 --> 51:48.726
but I do know that I'm
nothing like my mother.

51:48.728 --> 51:53.432
Holy shit, yes, you are.
You're like a rebooted Justice.

51:53.434 --> 51:55.269
I believe
he means to say remake.

51:55.902 --> 51:58.970
No, I mean to say reboot,
all right?

51:58.972 --> 52:01.840
Someone took all the things
I like about your mom,

52:01.842 --> 52:04.909
changed them just enough to make
me pay for them all over again,

52:04.911 --> 52:07.445
and added youth
and diversity to it.

52:07.447 --> 52:09.882
So this van is not moving
until you tell me

52:09.884 --> 52:11.753
why you wanna go to Hollywood
so bad.

52:13.086 --> 52:14.289
Fine.

52:15.655 --> 52:18.057
Shan Yu only has a week left
on her visa

52:18.059 --> 52:20.562
before her mom takes her back
to China forever.

52:21.028 --> 52:23.465
- So?
- So, you genital cuff...

52:24.532 --> 52:25.831
her favorite thing in the world

52:25.833 --> 52:28.269
is that old Bluntman and Chronic
movie.

52:28.702 --> 52:29.903
Bluntman.

52:30.804 --> 52:31.670
And for years now,

52:31.672 --> 52:33.572
she's been wanting to go
to Chronic-Con.

52:33.574 --> 52:36.608
So that's why this mission
is so important.

52:36.610 --> 52:39.345
Important enough
for a straight A student

52:39.347 --> 52:41.750
to get in a shitload of trouble
and blow up her future?

52:43.351 --> 52:44.849
God, you sound like my mother.

52:44.851 --> 52:45.953
Maybe that's because I'm...

52:46.487 --> 52:49.487
Maybe that's because I think
your mom's right, okay?

52:49.489 --> 52:51.389
I've done a bunch of stupid shit
when I was younger,

52:51.391 --> 52:53.858
but I did it with Si...
Mr. Taint here.

52:53.860 --> 52:55.626
Not with a bunch of people
I don't know.

52:55.628 --> 52:58.563
- Oh, I know these girls.
- How?

52:58.565 --> 53:00.398
How did you meet a deaf girl,

53:00.400 --> 53:02.434
a Muslim who's brother
tried to kill her,

53:02.436 --> 53:04.970
and a Chinese girl that I don't
even know where she's from,

53:04.972 --> 53:06.408
but she's suspect.

53:07.275 --> 53:09.043
And you're the only normal one
of the bunch.

53:09.543 --> 53:12.010
Fuck you, you don't know me.

53:12.012 --> 53:13.878
Uh, I've seen your life, kid,

53:13.880 --> 53:16.581
you got two moms who love you
and you grew up in a big house,

53:16.583 --> 53:18.684
you're not fucked up
like these girls.

53:18.686 --> 53:21.487
I only know these girls because
I'm fucked up just like them.

53:21.489 --> 53:23.590
How? How are you fucked up?

53:29.163 --> 53:30.865
We met
in an online support group.

53:32.565 --> 53:33.567
For what?

53:37.036 --> 53:39.006
For girls who have
never met their fathers.

53:41.942 --> 53:43.577
We don't know who our dads are.

53:44.210 --> 53:45.879
They all left
before we were born.

53:48.916 --> 53:51.115
You know... You know what, well,
fuck that, all right?

53:51.117 --> 53:53.552
You don't need a father,
I didn't grow up with a dad

53:53.554 --> 53:56.657
- and look, I turned out okay.
- No, you didn't.

53:58.092 --> 54:00.758
And if you never really had
a dad then you would know

54:00.760 --> 54:03.030
that there is no such thing
as okay...

54:04.164 --> 54:05.367
ever...

54:06.067 --> 54:08.434
because you will always
be haunted by a question

54:08.436 --> 54:09.704
that you can't answer.

54:11.972 --> 54:14.008
Why didn't you love me enough
to stick around?

54:21.681 --> 54:23.182
Well, I knew your dad
a little bit

54:23.184 --> 54:25.452
and, you know what,
you're better off without him.

54:27.788 --> 54:28.923
Guy's a piece of shit.

54:32.592 --> 54:33.827
Holy shit,
someone's on the roof.

54:39.833 --> 54:41.867
Merkin, what the fuck
are you doing?

54:41.869 --> 54:45.070
Hater Totz filled with hate!

54:45.072 --> 54:46.671
Hate!

54:46.673 --> 54:47.639
Hate!

54:47.641 --> 54:50.943
You got me arrested
with your grass, man.

54:50.945 --> 54:52.147
And you gave me zero tip,

54:52.614 --> 54:54.816
leave me these horrible reviews.
What is this?

54:55.315 --> 54:59.717
"Fuck your frozen food dreams."
That is personal and mean.

54:59.719 --> 55:02.019
To me! "Do you even know
what a merkin is?"

55:02.021 --> 55:05.023
Very funny, yes, I do.
It's a pube toupee.

55:05.025 --> 55:07.892
"Sit on some bald dick."
Who wrote that?

55:07.894 --> 55:09.028
Who's the fucker who wrote that?

55:09.030 --> 55:13.034
Do you think that's funny?
I am done losing at life.

55:13.601 --> 55:17.168
Fuck you guys, the two of you.
No one is gonna make

55:17.170 --> 55:21.539
Todd Merkinsky look like
an asshole ever again!

55:21.541 --> 55:23.944
Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep,
sleep, sleep, sleep...

55:29.849 --> 55:31.018
Hey!

55:32.186 --> 55:34.021
We got a runner,
we got a runner!

55:42.663 --> 55:45.833
Phase four, ditch old gay guys.
What the fuck?

55:46.266 --> 55:47.868
We should still steal
Merkin's car.

55:50.905 --> 55:52.871
We've been driving around
for hours, Silent Bob.

55:52.873 --> 55:54.075
Where the fuck did they go?

56:04.083 --> 56:06.017
Bro, are you serious?
You can't take a shit now.

56:06.019 --> 56:07.155
We have to find the girls.

56:21.936 --> 56:23.571
We need a fucking light.

56:29.842 --> 56:32.244
Oh, man, it's the fucking Klan!

56:32.246 --> 56:36.248
Dude, they ruin everything.
You distract these racist fucks,

56:36.250 --> 56:38.282
while I hotbox them
with some berserker.

56:46.893 --> 56:48.126
Peekaboo!

56:50.597 --> 56:52.863
We always have
a good time with that, don't we?

56:52.865 --> 56:53.999
Speaking of good times,

56:54.001 --> 56:56.233
if you stick around
till the end,

56:56.235 --> 56:58.869
we're gonna be
serving Hater Totz!

56:58.871 --> 57:00.070
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

57:00.072 --> 57:04.108
Hater Totz! Who doesn't love
Hater Totz? All right. Okay.

57:04.110 --> 57:07.748
Look what we found trespassing
in our backyard.

57:08.583 --> 57:11.749
And you know what happens
to trespassers, right?

57:11.751 --> 57:12.818
Can you dig it?

57:12.820 --> 57:13.985
Oh, yeah.

57:13.987 --> 57:16.023
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah.

57:16.724 --> 57:19.257
Can you dig it?

57:19.259 --> 57:21.059
Yeah!

57:21.061 --> 57:22.728
I'm digging it.

57:26.300 --> 57:28.068
Let me have your attention
for a moment.

57:30.003 --> 57:31.336
You're talking about what?

57:31.338 --> 57:34.171
You're talking about...
You're bitching about what?

57:34.173 --> 57:35.242
- Are they all here?
- Hey!

57:36.110 --> 57:38.776
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm going anyway.

57:38.778 --> 57:41.815
Let's talk about
something important.

57:44.652 --> 57:47.655
Put that pitchfork down.

57:55.128 --> 57:58.365
Pitchforks are
for Klansmen only.

57:58.865 --> 58:00.701
Where the fuck
did you come from?

58:01.168 --> 58:02.369
I come from downtown.

58:03.003 --> 58:05.137
I'm here for Mitch and Murray.

58:05.139 --> 58:06.941
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

58:09.342 --> 58:12.110
- Your name's Legree?
- Yeah.

58:12.112 --> 58:14.345
You call yourself a Klansman,
you son of a bitch?

58:14.347 --> 58:15.914
We don't got to listen
to this shit.

58:15.916 --> 58:17.081
You certainly don't, pal.

58:17.083 --> 58:18.986
Because the good news is,
you're fired.

58:19.619 --> 58:24.088
The bad news is you've got,
all you got, just one week

58:24.090 --> 58:26.925
to regain your jobs.
Starting with tonight.

58:26.927 --> 58:29.197
Starting with tonight's shit.

58:29.797 --> 58:31.329
Mister, what's your name?

58:31.331 --> 58:34.135
Fuck you, that's my name.

58:39.306 --> 58:45.110
A, B, D. Be,
D: Ducking.

58:45.112 --> 58:50.248
Always Be Ducking.
Always Be ducking.

58:50.250 --> 58:53.021
All right, fuck face. I'll bite.
Ducking what?

59:00.027 --> 59:02.994
- Kill these racist fucks!
- Hold on!

59:10.503 --> 59:13.740
Now who's stupid,
you dirty sheepfucker?

59:17.277 --> 59:19.313
Who in the fuck
are Mitch and Murray?

59:51.545 --> 59:54.081
Holy shit. We made it.

59:54.914 --> 59:56.817
No, we made it.

59:59.820 --> 01:00:00.822
You slept.

01:00:04.123 --> 01:00:06.026
You know, I got to
thank you, Mr. Underhill.

01:00:06.594 --> 01:00:09.362
Not for just saving our asses
last night, but...

01:00:10.797 --> 01:00:11.998
for helping us get here.

01:00:12.599 --> 01:00:14.335
Technically,
you forced me to help.

01:00:14.768 --> 01:00:16.204
Yeah, but for a good cause.

01:00:16.637 --> 01:00:18.970
Well, if your dreams came true
it was all worth it.

01:00:20.239 --> 01:00:22.776
Uh, going to Chronic-Con
is Shan Yu's dream.

01:00:23.577 --> 01:00:25.980
My dream is a little tougher
to make happen.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.481
It's stupid, especially
because you said

01:00:29.483 --> 01:00:31.352
the guy's a piece of shit.
But, um...

01:00:33.286 --> 01:00:35.322
I've always dreamed
of meeting my dad.

01:00:36.856 --> 01:00:38.893
Just hanging out.

01:00:40.427 --> 01:00:42.130
Nothing monumental.

01:00:43.864 --> 01:00:46.233
Just drinking coffee together
or something, like...

01:00:47.266 --> 01:00:48.969
talk to me like he was my dad...

01:00:50.369 --> 01:00:52.005
teaching me dad stuff.

01:00:57.978 --> 01:01:00.445
That's really embarrassing.
It probably sounds like

01:01:00.447 --> 01:01:03.317
the dumbest thing anyone
has ever said out loud.

01:01:10.324 --> 01:01:13.327
Oh, I got something
that nobody knows.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.097
God looks exactly
like Alanis Morissette.

01:01:19.498 --> 01:01:20.834

Did your mommy or daddy

01:02:56.396 --> 01:02:58.595
We got a Bluntman

Good day. Chris Hemsworth
and, uh, I've been paid to...

01:03:38.338 --> 01:03:40.771
To welcome you to the tenth
Annual Hollywood Chronic-Con.

01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:43.208
Yay. Welcome.
Uh, now, full disclosure.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.708
I'm not the real
Chris Hemsworth.

01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:46.510
I'm only a hologram,
as you can see.

01:03:46.512 --> 01:03:48.512
So, uh,
feel free to take selfies

01:03:48.514 --> 01:03:50.447
with my holographic image.
Um, but, please,

01:03:50.449 --> 01:03:52.349
and I can't even believe I have
to fucking say this,

01:03:52.351 --> 01:03:54.552
but please do not
hump the hologram.

01:03:54.554 --> 01:03:57.322
All right? Or you'll burn
your dick off or whatever it is

01:03:57.324 --> 01:03:59.324
that you're thrusting
into the hologram.

01:03:59.326 --> 01:04:02.427
So don't do it. Do not fellate
the hologram either, you know?

01:04:02.429 --> 01:04:03.695
You might burn your mouth off.

01:04:03.697 --> 01:04:05.729
And... And please don't record
yourself having conversations

01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:08.465
with the holographic version of
me as if you're talking to me

01:04:08.467 --> 01:04:09.566
saying things like,
"Oh, I'm gonna...

01:04:09.568 --> 01:04:12.137
I'm gonna hump you
until you're Thor." You know?

01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:14.304
Only my wife is allowed to
objectify me like that.

01:04:14.306 --> 01:04:16.041
And I have no choice in that.
But I have a choice in this.

01:04:16.043 --> 01:04:17.108
So don't do it.

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:18.108
Now, if you're looking for

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:20.478
all the big celebrity
guest panels, go left.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.746
Uh, if you wanna be an extra

01:04:21.748 --> 01:04:23.615
in the new Bluntman movie,
go right.

01:04:23.617 --> 01:04:26.083
But whichever way you go,
uh, hope you have fun

01:04:26.085 --> 01:04:29.454
at this year's Chronic-Con.
Because you're Hems-worth it.

01:04:29.456 --> 01:04:30.724
Trademark, Chris Hemsworth.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.363
Oh. We came a long way.

01:04:36.396 --> 01:04:37.398
Let's do this.

01:04:44.103 --> 01:04:45.205
Yo!

01:04:46.639 --> 01:04:48.539
Where the fuck are you going?

01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:51.575
Uh, we came to Hollywood
so Shan Yu could be an extra

01:04:51.577 --> 01:04:55.112
in that stupid Bluntman reboot.
And that is this way.

01:04:55.114 --> 01:04:56.481
And we came to Hollywood

01:04:56.483 --> 01:04:58.849
to stop this stupid reboot
from happening.

01:04:58.851 --> 01:05:01.719
And all the famous people
are this way.

01:05:01.721 --> 01:05:03.157
Stop the reboot? Why?

01:05:03.657 --> 01:05:05.657
It's a long story,
but it ends with us

01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:07.494
kicking the shit
out of Kevin James.

01:05:08.128 --> 01:05:10.463
Fuck Kevin James.
Kevin can wait.

01:05:10.896 --> 01:05:13.197
What we're doing
is really important.

01:05:13.199 --> 01:05:16.133
Uh, us stopping the movie
is the most important thing

01:05:16.135 --> 01:05:18.438
we're ever gonna do... again.

01:05:24.744 --> 01:05:27.280
Look, I have risked everything
to come here...

01:05:28.248 --> 01:05:29.481
but it will be all be worth it

01:05:29.483 --> 01:05:31.516
if Shan Yu can be
in that reboot.

01:05:31.518 --> 01:05:32.519
So I guess...

01:05:33.853 --> 01:05:35.221
I guess this is goodbye.

01:05:36.489 --> 01:05:38.391
No. Wait a... Wait a minute.

01:05:43.163 --> 01:05:44.197
This, um...

01:05:44.998 --> 01:05:48.566
This is my legacy right here,
it's the last one

01:05:48.568 --> 01:05:49.570
in the whole world...

01:05:50.336 --> 01:05:53.273
and I want you to have it
to remember me by.

01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:56.307
But when you smoke it

01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:58.079
you're not gonna
remember shit, so...

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.514
save it for a special occasion.

01:06:19.932 --> 01:06:21.135
Um...

01:06:22.835 --> 01:06:25.605
I don't know a lot of stuff,
okay? But...

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.175
I do know this...

01:06:29.543 --> 01:06:32.546
you're a great fucking kid
and some asshole

01:06:33.146 --> 01:06:35.682
really missed out
on being your dad.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.122
Thanks.

01:07:10.382 --> 01:07:11.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07:12.952 --> 01:07:14.586
Where are your badges?

01:07:14.588 --> 01:07:17.688
Nobody gets in, as the French
say... sans badge.

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:20.925
Come on, you security dick,
what's the big deal anyway?

01:07:20.927 --> 01:07:22.059
Security dick?

01:07:22.061 --> 01:07:25.729
The big deal is we got America's
most precious resources

01:07:25.731 --> 01:07:27.331
behind these doors.

01:07:27.333 --> 01:07:31.469
Actors, actresses, directors,
podcasters,

01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:33.670
they make us laugh,
they make us cry,

01:07:33.672 --> 01:07:35.472
they show us ourselves.

01:07:35.474 --> 01:07:38.008
And it's my job
not only to keep them safe

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:40.311
from their greasiest
nut bar fans

01:07:40.313 --> 01:07:41.448
with the hammers of justice,

01:07:41.914 --> 01:07:43.548
but also to meet every one

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:46.253
of their
borderline infantile needs.

01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:48.756
Hey, security dick.

01:07:49.856 --> 01:07:50.824
Oh.

01:07:51.291 --> 01:07:53.657
Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's
Dead's Keith Coogan.

01:07:53.659 --> 01:07:54.958
It's just Keith.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.360
Thanks,
that's really hard to say.

01:07:56.362 --> 01:07:58.429
The candy buffet ran out
of Swedish Fish.

01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:00.900
So I guess...

01:08:01.735 --> 01:08:03.034
...wait for it.

01:08:03.036 --> 01:08:05.369
The fishes are done, man.

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:10.244
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:08:12.378 --> 01:08:13.380
Hilarious.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:25.290
I have a question for the real
Jay and Silent Bob.

01:08:25.292 --> 01:08:26.827
All right,
this reboot is bullshit.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.863
Bullshit, what do you guys
think about this reboot?

01:08:30.395 --> 01:08:32.296
I got... I got this one.

01:08:32.298 --> 01:08:33.997
Yeah, um, it sucks.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.867
There, I said it.
Are you happy now, TMZ?

01:08:36.868 --> 01:08:38.102
Dude, TMZ's not even here.

01:08:38.104 --> 01:08:41.772
And who's directing this shit
anyway, Kevin fucking Smith?

01:08:42.876 --> 01:08:46.510
Are you fucking kidding me?
This movie is doomed.

01:08:46.511 --> 01:08:48.712
It is... I was in Jersey Girl,
okay,

01:08:48.715 --> 01:08:50.080
- destroyed my career.
- Yup.

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:52.716
Bluntman and Chronic
was a cult classic, okay,

01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:54.618
it doesn't need
a Kevin Smith remake.

01:08:54.621 --> 01:08:55.689
Reboot.

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:57.888
How are you not pissed off, huh?

01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:00.424
Kevin Smith
is literally shitting

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:02.395
in the mouth
of the original movie.

01:09:03.697 --> 01:09:04.995
I think the movie
is gonna be great.

01:09:04.997 --> 01:09:06.531
Why are you sucking
the reboot's dick?

01:09:06.533 --> 01:09:08.665
They're not gonna put you in it,
all right.

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:10.403
They're never gonna call you,
Diplo.

01:09:10.871 --> 01:09:13.737
- Listen, buttfucker.
- Van Der Bitch.

01:09:13.738 --> 01:09:16.010
Ooh, he called him
Van Der Bitch.

01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:19.712
Interlopers.

01:09:20.712 --> 01:09:21.715
Shit!

01:09:29.787 --> 01:09:34.327
Of all said words, with tongue
or pen, the saddest of these,

01:09:34.895 --> 01:09:36.663
they canceled Comic Book Men.

01:10:03.722 --> 01:10:06.456
Look at these
morose motherfuckers right here.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.398
Smells like somebody shit
in their cereal. Bong.

01:10:14.134 --> 01:10:15.166
Holy fuck,

01:10:15.168 --> 01:10:18.035
they got you mixed
up in this reboot shit, too?

01:10:18.037 --> 01:10:19.303
You sound like my agent.

01:10:19.305 --> 01:10:22.139
What are you two dirt merchants
doing in this neck of Hollywood?

01:10:22.141 --> 01:10:25.143
Oh, I'll tell you what our necks
are doing in Holly's wood.

01:10:25.145 --> 01:10:28.412
We're here to stop that
fuckin' reboot from happening,

01:10:28.414 --> 01:10:30.781
so take us to Kevin James.

01:10:30.783 --> 01:10:32.085
First of all, hi.

01:10:32.952 --> 01:10:34.121
Nice to see you.

01:10:35.587 --> 01:10:36.987
Been years, oh.

01:10:36.989 --> 01:10:38.091
Nice to see you.

01:10:39.225 --> 01:10:41.826
Good to see that one of you
at least is taking his age

01:10:41.828 --> 01:10:43.160
and his health seriously.

01:10:43.162 --> 01:10:44.594
Hey, what's with all the wires?

01:10:44.596 --> 01:10:45.830
Are you trying
to destroy the stage?

01:10:45.832 --> 01:10:48.402
Oh, just finished recording
a live episode of my podcast.

01:10:48.935 --> 01:10:51.134
Holy fuck,
you got a podcast, too?

01:10:51.136 --> 01:10:53.571
Is it to contextualize life
in America

01:10:53.573 --> 01:10:55.940
- for your audience in China?
- What?

01:10:55.942 --> 01:10:58.709
No, I interview people
in the funny book biz.

01:10:58.711 --> 01:11:01.044
Since this is my first
Chronic-Con as guest of honor,

01:11:01.046 --> 01:11:02.946
it's time I got someone else
to interview me.

01:11:02.948 --> 01:11:04.816
Who? Banky fucking Edwards?

01:11:04.818 --> 01:11:06.552
Not Banky fucking Edwards.

01:11:07.987 --> 01:11:09.655
Alyssa fucking Jones.

01:11:10.122 --> 01:11:11.657
It's fucking Finger-Cuffs.

01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:13.590
Oh, my God.

01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:14.925
Wait, what's so funny?

01:11:14.927 --> 01:11:16.928
Remember Chasing Amy,
the classy book I did

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:18.862
after Bluntman and Chronic that
won me all the awards?

01:11:18.864 --> 01:11:22.165
Anyway, Alyssa's turning that
book into a series for Netflix.

01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:24.101
It was always a story that
should have been told

01:11:24.103 --> 01:11:27.737
from a queer perspective
or a woman's perspective

01:11:27.739 --> 01:11:31.142
or any perspective other than
a cis white man's.

01:11:31.144 --> 01:11:32.710
Anyway we're laughing
because Netflix wants

01:11:32.712 --> 01:11:33.977
an edgier title
than Chasing Amy,

01:11:33.979 --> 01:11:35.847
one of their suggestions
was Finger-Cuffs.

01:11:35.849 --> 01:11:37.482
You should text them a picture

01:11:37.484 --> 01:11:39.549
of these two juggle heads,
and say they love your title.

01:11:39.551 --> 01:11:41.785
Who are they? Harold and Kumar?

01:11:41.787 --> 01:11:44.722
What? No. This is the actual
Jay and Silent Bob.

01:11:44.724 --> 01:11:45.425
- What?
- Yeah.

01:11:45.992 --> 01:11:47.157
Me and Banky used to buy weed
off these guys at Quik Stop.

01:11:47.159 --> 01:11:49.494
That's where I got the idea
for Bluntman and Chronic.

01:11:49.496 --> 01:11:52.132
Then the quiet one gave me
the title idea for Chasing Amy.

01:11:52.564 --> 01:11:53.998
Come to think of it,
you motherfuckers

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.866
pay off like slot machines.

01:11:55.868 --> 01:11:57.235
Save some new shit for me
to steal.

01:11:57.237 --> 01:11:59.003
There you are.

01:11:59.005 --> 01:11:59.803
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

01:11:59.805 --> 01:12:01.539
- Hey, Holden. Great panel.
- Hey.

01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:03.674
Um, she's looking for you,
again.

01:12:03.676 --> 01:12:05.009
- Already?
- Yes.

01:12:05.011 --> 01:12:06.914
- I'm off to release the Kraken.
- Sorry.

01:12:08.648 --> 01:12:09.946
"Release the Kraken,"
what is that,

01:12:09.948 --> 01:12:11.652
a sex thing
between married people?

01:12:12.118 --> 01:12:14.887
Are you even remotely familiar
with the story of Chasing Amy?

01:12:15.354 --> 01:12:18.022
You're in it. I know it's a lot
of words, but fuck.

01:12:18.024 --> 01:12:20.525
No, she's gay, bro.

01:12:20.527 --> 01:12:22.559
Okay, obviously
Alyssa and I aren't married,

01:12:22.561 --> 01:12:25.131
married people don't like
each other. We're co-parents.

01:12:26.298 --> 01:12:28.566
- Wait a second, you have a kid?
- Yeah.

01:12:28.568 --> 01:12:30.134
Alyssa and her partner wanted
to have a baby

01:12:30.136 --> 01:12:32.637
and since we've known each other
and, more importantly,

01:12:32.639 --> 01:12:35.272
liked each other for 20 years,
they asked me to be the father.

01:12:35.274 --> 01:12:37.944
Yes, you got to hit
that shit again, son?

01:12:39.279 --> 01:12:41.879
I can see you've matured well.

01:12:41.881 --> 01:12:43.714
No, I got to hit
the doctor's office

01:12:43.716 --> 01:12:45.081
where I filled a cup.

01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:47.621
We went in-vitro. Science, bro.

01:12:48.988 --> 01:12:51.792
You know, a year later I met
a girl who loves me.

01:12:52.692 --> 01:12:54.228
Who loves me.

01:12:57.564 --> 01:12:59.196
She wants to know
who Daddy's talking to.

01:12:59.198 --> 01:13:00.901
Hi, little pink sugar heart.

01:13:03.002 --> 01:13:04.302
Say hi to Daddy's friends.

01:13:04.304 --> 01:13:06.670
Daddy's known these boys
since he was little.

01:13:06.672 --> 01:13:08.742
Boys, this is our daughter, Amy.

01:13:11.844 --> 01:13:14.111
Dude, just like that story
you tell.

01:13:14.113 --> 01:13:15.849
Say hello to Jay and Silent Bob.

01:13:16.916 --> 01:13:18.252
Hi, Jay and Silent Bob.

01:13:19.586 --> 01:13:20.554
Hi.

01:13:21.186 --> 01:13:23.256
Whoop.

01:13:24.323 --> 01:13:26.357
So you got her?
We're gonna go grab a smoke

01:13:26.359 --> 01:13:27.861
and check out the cosplay.

01:13:30.029 --> 01:13:32.263
Okay. Have fun,
thanks for the interview.

01:13:33.899 --> 01:13:35.665
So what do you think, kiddo?

01:13:35.667 --> 01:13:37.300
Do you like
these stinky old fools?

01:13:37.302 --> 01:13:38.369
Mm-hmm.

01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:40.004
Dude, how did something
so amazing

01:13:40.006 --> 01:13:42.242
come from your funny book
making balls?

01:13:43.842 --> 01:13:45.945
Well, it's a mystery to me,
too, G.

01:13:47.313 --> 01:13:48.748
I'm a huge fan of the kid.

01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:52.685
Bluntman's getting a reboot,
Netflix is making Amy.

01:13:53.619 --> 01:13:54.652
People hate the present so much,

01:13:54.654 --> 01:13:56.620
it's like they wanna
retreat into the past.

01:13:56.622 --> 01:13:58.625
All of a sudden
all my old bullshit is back.

01:13:59.626 --> 01:14:01.692
And some of that old bullshit
meant the world to me

01:14:01.694 --> 01:14:02.829
when I was starting out.

01:14:04.029 --> 01:14:05.696
But now that all my
childhood dreams

01:14:05.698 --> 01:14:06.630
are starting to come true,

01:14:06.632 --> 01:14:08.201
I mean, it's nice,
don't get me wrong...

01:14:08.868 --> 01:14:11.071
that kid is just
way more interesting to me.

01:14:11.671 --> 01:14:13.269
I used to think life
was all about me,

01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:14.839
I was the hero of my own story.

01:14:14.841 --> 01:14:16.840
A Bruce Wayne
of one life-long issue

01:14:16.842 --> 01:14:18.144
of Detective Comics,
so to speak.

01:14:19.145 --> 01:14:21.715
And then that kid came along
and suddenly you realize...

01:14:22.981 --> 01:14:24.618
you're not Bruce Wayne anymore.

01:14:25.717 --> 01:14:27.183
You're Thomas Wayne

01:14:27.185 --> 01:14:30.655
or Bruce Wayne's mom,
whose name escapes me.

01:14:30.657 --> 01:14:33.057
♪ Stay, and don't you ever
Run away... ♪

01:14:33.059 --> 01:14:35.829
Anyway, I'm just here to set
the real story in motion.

01:14:37.162 --> 01:14:38.896
Because once you become
a parent,

01:14:38.898 --> 01:14:41.168
you're not the star anymore.
You're the stage.

01:14:42.668 --> 01:14:44.669
I'm just here to prop up
my kid so she can put on

01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:46.873
the show of her life,
like my parents did for me,

01:14:47.372 --> 01:14:48.772
like theirs did before them.

01:14:48.774 --> 01:14:50.340
And if you're lucky enough
to have a kid,

01:14:50.342 --> 01:14:53.143
the tradeoff is you don't really
get a third act to your story,

01:14:53.145 --> 01:14:54.347
because the story changes.

01:14:54.814 --> 01:14:56.716
All of a sudden
it's not about you anymore...

01:14:57.384 --> 01:14:59.286
for the first time
in your self-involved life...

01:15:00.386 --> 01:15:01.855
that's okay.

01:15:02.822 --> 01:15:04.056
Kids are like our reboots,

01:15:04.556 --> 01:15:06.357
another chance to tell
a brand-new version

01:15:06.359 --> 01:15:07.661
of the same old story.

01:15:08.194 --> 01:15:09.860
I know I'm supposed to be
teaching Amy stuff,

01:15:09.862 --> 01:15:12.365
but it's like I'm learning
from her every day.

01:15:13.899 --> 01:15:16.869
So, spend my days chasing Amy...

01:15:18.738 --> 01:15:19.836
so to speak.

01:15:19.838 --> 01:15:22.238
♪ Stay with me ♪

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.741
Look. I know I dragged us all
the way to Hollywood

01:15:24.743 --> 01:15:27.143
to stop this fucking reboot
from happening,

01:15:27.145 --> 01:15:28.411
but I haven't been there
for Milly

01:15:28.413 --> 01:15:30.281

Silent Bob.

01:15:30.283 --> 01:15:31.418
Sorry. Who's Milly?

01:15:32.118 --> 01:15:35.052
And we came
to get our names back,

01:15:35.054 --> 01:15:37.353
but I have a new fucking name,
Silent Bob,

01:15:37.355 --> 01:15:39.389
and it's fucking Dad, okay?

01:15:39.391 --> 01:15:42.229
And that will be the only name
I ever need again.

01:15:45.264 --> 01:15:47.764

get us in the reboot shoot

I don't know
if anybody knows this,

but last year,
I had a heart attack.

01:17:39.545 --> 01:17:42.045
So, what I did
was cast the movie

01:17:42.047 --> 01:17:45.382
with a bunch of people
who were sad that I almost died.

01:17:45.384 --> 01:17:47.154
I guilted the cast...

you know, SAG should give us

but this is now

When you said you wanted to V,
you meant vaping?

- No.

01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:54.670
I have. It just looked
at me like, "Oh?"

01:20:54.672 --> 01:20:58.709
I gave a dog a 20-dollar bill
once, man. It didn't work out.

01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:07.052
Hey, is this one of those
comic book movies, man?

01:21:09.889 --> 01:21:12.092
Oh, am I in Black Panther?

01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:17.529
Oh, fuck.

01:21:19.198 --> 01:21:21.397
Genius!

01:21:21.399 --> 01:21:22.768
Wow fucking wow.

01:21:23.769 --> 01:21:26.303
Give that man an Oscar.

01:21:26.305 --> 01:21:28.438
And that's just a taste,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.540
That's a soupçon.

01:21:29.542 --> 01:21:32.142
Okay, the scene that
we're gonna shoot here today,

01:21:32.144 --> 01:21:36.345
right now, is the invasion
of Chronic-Con, man.

01:21:36.347 --> 01:21:38.848
So, give it up
for the contemptible

01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:42.421
Cock Knocker Cockmandos,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:43.122 --> 01:21:46.456
Look at that shit.
We spent so much money

01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:48.592
on those costumes
it's fucking crazy.

01:21:48.594 --> 01:21:50.460
So, the cast is fucking huge.

01:21:50.462 --> 01:21:51.695
I'm still thinking about
putting my friend,

01:21:51.697 --> 01:21:52.795
Jason Mewes, in it and shit.

01:21:52.797 --> 01:21:55.531
And the jury is out
on whether I put my kid in it.

01:21:55.533 --> 01:21:56.367
She's an actress now.

01:21:56.836 --> 01:21:58.802
But I don't believe in nepotism
so I might leave her out of it.

01:21:58.804 --> 01:22:00.707
Man, she can earn her own
fucking keep in Hollywood.

01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:04.110
- Just so I can...
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:22:04.944 --> 01:22:06.677
He kind of looks like
the director.

01:22:06.679 --> 01:22:08.611
...is gonna be
in the actual picture.

01:22:08.613 --> 01:22:11.482
My bad,
I forgot to say spoilers.

01:22:11.484 --> 01:22:14.518
No way, man.
That guy wears jorts.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.352
This guy would never wear jorts.

01:22:16.354 --> 01:22:18.554
- What the fuck are jorts?
- Jean shorts.

01:22:18.556 --> 01:22:19.723
That was our goal...

01:22:19.725 --> 01:22:21.791
You stay here.
Wait for my signal.

01:22:21.793 --> 01:22:22.759
That's possible.

01:22:22.761 --> 01:22:24.128
You, come with me.

01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:25.062
...with the walrus movie,

01:22:25.064 --> 01:22:27.296
but look at that.
Before we get started,

01:22:27.298 --> 01:22:28.632
I have to go backstage

01:22:28.634 --> 01:22:30.400
and take care
of some very important

01:22:30.402 --> 01:22:31.735
director-type things.

01:22:31.737 --> 01:22:33.669
But as soon as I get back, man,

01:22:33.671 --> 01:22:35.606
we're gonna make some
movie magic together,

01:22:35.608 --> 01:22:38.509
ladies and gentlemen.
Yes, movie magic!

01:22:40.845 --> 01:22:43.546
Where is my smoking jacket?

01:22:43.548 --> 01:22:45.214
Did you see that crowd
out there, Mike?

01:22:45.216 --> 01:22:48.518
Fuck, man. We're back, bitch.
Fuck Cop Out.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.486
Thank you, my friend.

01:22:50.488 --> 01:22:52.623
Mm, life is good.

01:22:52.625 --> 01:22:56.762
Life is good and I'm now alone
and finally...

01:22:58.396 --> 01:22:59.399
Mm.

01:23:20.618 --> 01:23:21.621
Hey!

01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:23.890
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

01:23:25.858 --> 01:23:27.260
Where's this signal at?

01:23:30.695 --> 01:23:31.928
I need to talk to him.

01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:33.664
- He is occupied.
- Who are you?

01:23:33.666 --> 01:23:34.830
He told me to tell you...

01:23:34.832 --> 01:23:35.831
He told you what?

01:23:35.833 --> 01:23:37.836
- Those girls and that old man.
- He told you?

01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:45.578
So...

01:23:46.311 --> 01:23:49.213
the director stopped
speaking to me. Yeah.

01:23:49.215 --> 01:23:50.281
I'm the first AD.

01:23:50.283 --> 01:23:51.915
Right, so this whole thing
has gone off the rails.

01:23:51.917 --> 01:23:53.784
This is a shitshow, worse
than House Party 4.

01:23:53.786 --> 01:23:54.951
Trust me when I say that.

01:23:54.953 --> 01:23:57.553
But he told some little girl
who I've never met before

01:23:57.555 --> 01:24:00.656
to tell me to tell you that he
would like all of you diverse

01:24:00.658 --> 01:24:03.259
and interesting young children
to get on stage with him today

01:24:03.261 --> 01:24:04.227
and do this scene.

01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:05.963
Hello, everybody.

01:24:05.965 --> 01:24:09.569
I'm here because Kevin Smith
lost his voice.

01:24:12.637 --> 01:24:17.273
Oh. But he asked me to tell you
to welcome to the stage

01:24:17.275 --> 01:24:22.411
all the way from China,
Bluntman superfan, Shan Yu.

01:24:29.654 --> 01:24:30.956
Woo!

01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:38.730
Come on. Come on.

01:24:46.072 --> 01:24:50.540
Oh, holy shit. That girl just
pulled a gun on Kevin Smith.

01:24:50.542 --> 01:24:53.309
'Cause she probably paid to see
Yoga Hosers.

01:24:53.311 --> 01:24:54.814
That's not Kevin Smith.

01:24:55.814 --> 01:24:56.816
Fist him.

01:24:58.751 --> 01:25:00.517
Oh, shit.

01:25:00.519 --> 01:25:03.286
The guy that's not Kevin Smith
just got fisted.

01:25:03.288 --> 01:25:05.789
And he didn't even use
lubricant.

01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:07.894
Throw that trash
into the garbage.

01:25:09.395 --> 01:25:10.760
Commence collusion.

01:25:12.931 --> 01:25:15.367
So the fake Cock Knockers
are the real bad guys.

01:25:15.835 --> 01:25:18.367
Fuck, this movie's hard
to keep straight.

01:25:18.369 --> 01:25:20.303
What are you doing, Shan Yu?

01:25:20.305 --> 01:25:22.442
Is it not as clear as vodka?

01:25:23.009 --> 01:25:25.310
I'm not teenager from China.

01:25:31.082 --> 01:25:33.983
I am secret agent from Russia.

01:25:33.985 --> 01:25:36.855
One of them was wearing
a cat suit, I fucking knew it.

01:25:41.393 --> 01:25:43.262
He smells American too.

01:25:58.877 --> 01:26:01.547
Russia's infiltrated
American banks,

01:26:02.213 --> 01:26:04.984
we have infiltrated
American elections,

01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:07.886
and now, thanks to you...

01:26:08.854 --> 01:26:12.891
we infiltrate American
pop culture conventions.

01:26:13.826 --> 01:26:14.958
Why?

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.692
Take out your mobile devices

01:26:16.694 --> 01:26:18.829
and broadcast
this historic moment

01:26:18.831 --> 01:26:20.565
to the rest of the world.

01:26:21.833 --> 01:26:23.866
What if
you only have a flip phone?

01:26:23.868 --> 01:26:25.771
People of America...

01:26:27.038 --> 01:26:31.777
I come in peace,
but director of Jersey Girl...

01:26:34.078 --> 01:26:35.447
Holy fuck!

01:26:36.481 --> 01:26:37.216
Ow.

01:26:37.783 --> 01:26:42.585
He will soon go to pieces when
I execute him live on internet.

01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:46.492
Is this because
I'm a proud jorts wearer?

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:48.959
This because
you're standard issue,

01:26:48.961 --> 01:26:52.562
overrated American pop culture
celebrity

01:26:52.564 --> 01:26:54.430
who repeats himself
artistically,

01:26:54.432 --> 01:26:57.567
if what you do
can even be called art,

01:26:57.569 --> 01:27:00.773
and clings desperately
to past glory of 1990s.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.572
You've been talking to my wife.

01:27:03.574 --> 01:27:05.577
I'm not gonna let you do this,
Shan Yu.

01:27:06.145 --> 01:27:09.713
But you helped me do this,
Millennium.

01:27:09.715 --> 01:27:13.016
I catfish you and your friends

01:27:13.018 --> 01:27:15.451
so I can harness
the liberal sympathies

01:27:15.453 --> 01:27:17.553
of broken young women

01:27:17.555 --> 01:27:20.960
who hoped to fill the deep
emotional void left by...

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.931
a sibling who tries
to kill you...

01:27:25.963 --> 01:27:28.934
or the solitude of silence...

01:27:29.734 --> 01:27:33.903
or worsen your privileged life
crying about the father

01:27:33.905 --> 01:27:36.809
who left you
before you were even born.

01:27:37.676 --> 01:27:41.143
Ooh, sick fucking burn, man.
I'll shut up.

01:27:41.145 --> 01:27:43.448
Maybe her dad didn't leave her.

01:27:44.048 --> 01:27:45.083
What he say?

01:27:47.051 --> 01:27:48.552
Maybe her dad didn't even know

01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:50.155
he had a kid
until the other day.

01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:53.690
What are you saying?

01:27:53.692 --> 01:27:55.491
Jesus,
for a private school girl,

01:27:55.493 --> 01:27:58.398
you're pretty fucking stupid.
I'm your father.

01:27:59.898 --> 01:28:01.000
Oh, God. Wait.

01:28:03.167 --> 01:28:06.969
- No way. No... No fucking way.
- Yes fucking way.

01:28:06.971 --> 01:28:09.772
But I only found out the day
we came to Chicago

01:28:09.774 --> 01:28:11.241
and I wanted to tell you
the whole trip,

01:28:11.243 --> 01:28:13.175
but I promised your mom
I wouldn't.

01:28:13.177 --> 01:28:15.678
But I'm telling you now,
because, sometimes,

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:19.182
breaking a promise is the right
fucking thing to do, all right?

01:28:19.184 --> 01:28:21.485
Because if I kept every promise
I ever made,

01:28:21.487 --> 01:28:23.018
you wouldn't be here,

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:24.219
because this one time,

01:28:24.221 --> 01:28:26.889
I made a promise to your mom
that I wouldn't cum in her.

01:28:26.891 --> 01:28:29.692
- What the fuck, man!
- Look, I'm sorry, all right?

01:28:29.694 --> 01:28:32.728
I was only stalling
so I could get closer

01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:36.802
to the guy with the big-ass gun,
now!

01:28:38.904 --> 01:28:40.036
Yes!

01:28:40.038 --> 01:28:41.474
Here comes... ♪♪♪

01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:43.940
This fucker's fake, dude.

01:28:43.942 --> 01:28:45.043
Why would it be real?

01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:47.076
No!

01:28:47.078 --> 01:28:49.211
Don't any of you
cosplaying cocks have some

01:28:49.213 --> 01:28:51.113
- real fucking guns? What the...
- I sees him...

01:28:51.115 --> 01:28:52.685
- Let him go!
- Nyet.

01:28:53.252 --> 01:28:55.785
Before we execute Kevin Smith...

01:28:55.787 --> 01:28:56.719
Fuck.

01:28:56.721 --> 01:28:59.889
...first, we execute
this old degenerate.

01:28:59.891 --> 01:29:02.526
- No!
- Old? Man, fuck you!

01:29:02.528 --> 01:29:05.995
I give big daddy a moment
to offer his newfound daughter

01:29:05.997 --> 01:29:10.901
any last heartfelt words
before we stop his heart.

01:29:10.903 --> 01:29:13.969
Kid, I'm okay with dying
right now,

01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:18.040
because I know a small piece
of me is gonna live on in you.

01:29:18.042 --> 01:29:20.809
Not if they fucking kill me too,
you idiot.

01:29:20.811 --> 01:29:24.050
Holy shit, you're right.
Somebody save me!

01:29:28.287 --> 01:29:29.152
What was that?

01:29:29.154 --> 01:29:32.955
Ooh, you made him mad,
he's mad now!

01:29:36.795 --> 01:29:42.598
- What is that, Ted Underhill?
- I am not Ted Underhill.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.067
Oh, fuck.
He's got a secret identity.

01:29:45.069 --> 01:29:48.170
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:29:48.172 --> 01:29:49.675
I'm Jay...

01:29:50.509 --> 01:29:53.246
...and this is
my hetero-lifemate...

01:29:55.314 --> 01:29:57.182
Iron Bob!

01:30:00.953 --> 01:30:02.218
It's Robert Downey, Jr.

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.624
- What?
- Oh, Marvel gonna sue somebody.

01:30:13.631 --> 01:30:14.863
Shoot the tin man.

01:30:14.865 --> 01:30:16.868
Shoot! keep shooting!

01:30:19.104 --> 01:30:20.773
Dasvidaniya!

01:30:22.841 --> 01:30:24.641
Yeah, Iron Bob!

01:30:24.643 --> 01:30:26.846
For Mother Russia! Ow!

01:30:38.756 --> 01:30:40.091
We know that guy.

01:30:42.293 --> 01:30:45.762
Holy fuck! I can't wait until
they make him a Funko Pop.

01:30:54.905 --> 01:30:57.973
Oh, my God, he just spoke
fucking Valyrian!

01:30:57.975 --> 01:31:00.943
I'll fuck anything that moves!

01:31:00.945 --> 01:31:01.812
Eject!

01:31:01.814 --> 01:31:03.979
Holy shit, this shit's
fucking bananas!

01:31:03.981 --> 01:31:06.252
Go! Hadouken!

01:31:06.752 --> 01:31:08.918
Man, I smell some
fucking good weed,

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:10.053
that's some of that
dank-ass shit,

01:31:10.055 --> 01:31:12.921
knock a motherfucker out
just like that. Like I said...

01:31:17.929 --> 01:31:21.333
Oh, shit.
I've been drugged.

01:31:22.667 --> 01:31:23.835
That's strong shit.

01:31:24.269 --> 01:31:26.402
Hey, little girl.
Can I buy some weed from you?

01:31:26.404 --> 01:31:27.606
I'm busy.

01:31:33.744 --> 01:31:35.914
My precious podcasting ears!

01:31:36.515 --> 01:31:38.684
- Fuck!
- It hurts, Yes?

01:31:39.283 --> 01:31:42.988
That's because this is
not a podcast recording device.

01:31:44.088 --> 01:31:46.826
It is KGB sonic disrupter.

01:31:47.326 --> 01:31:49.362
You suck!

01:31:58.904 --> 01:31:59.905
Fuck, yeah!

01:32:05.277 --> 01:32:06.976
Let's get aggressive, girls.

01:32:12.016 --> 01:32:13.083
Fuck.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.220
That joint you gave me
really came in handy.

01:32:18.222 --> 01:32:20.292
Whatever you do, don't tell
your mom I gave you weed.

01:32:21.158 --> 01:32:24.460
Oh, my God, I fucking love
this reboot. Oh, shit.

01:32:24.462 --> 01:32:25.329
All right.

01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:27.464
So right about now, man,
we finished up

01:32:27.466 --> 01:32:30.032
all three acts of the story,
all the main characters

01:32:30.034 --> 01:32:31.302
are where they need to be...

01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:35.071
all that's left is the emotional
denouement.

01:32:35.073 --> 01:32:36.071
In order to get there,

01:32:36.073 --> 01:32:38.911
maybe I'll start
a slow dissolve right about now.

01:32:58.796 --> 01:32:59.964
So now what do we do?

01:33:00.465 --> 01:33:02.232
I wanted to talk to you
about that.

01:33:02.234 --> 01:33:03.235
Um...

01:33:04.502 --> 01:33:06.005
I've never had a kid before.

01:33:06.505 --> 01:33:08.306
It's okay, I never had
a dad before.

01:33:10.074 --> 01:33:11.174
Yeah, but the thing is...

01:33:11.176 --> 01:33:13.746
Is I don't know if I'm ready
to be somebody's dad.

01:33:17.248 --> 01:33:20.251
Save it, old man. I...
I get it.

01:33:28.126 --> 01:33:29.459
Like I was saying,

01:33:29.461 --> 01:33:31.928
I don't know if I'm ready
to be somebody's dad,

01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:33.365
so I wanna practice.

01:33:33.864 --> 01:33:37.400
And so I figured, why not start
off with a dream I always had

01:33:37.402 --> 01:33:39.335
of drinking coffee with my kid

01:33:39.337 --> 01:33:42.141
and teaching her stuff
that she doesn't already know.

01:33:42.974 --> 01:33:43.976
Like dad stuff.

01:33:45.143 --> 01:33:46.145
Okay?

01:33:50.015 --> 01:33:51.880
Okay. I've hung out
in front of this store

01:33:51.882 --> 01:33:55.153
almost my whole life.
My advice, don't do that.

01:33:56.154 --> 01:33:57.223
Not for a while.

01:33:57.855 --> 01:33:59.455
First, find a best friend

01:33:59.457 --> 01:34:01.424
you can have
a whole lot of adventures with.

01:34:01.426 --> 01:34:03.526
But pick a good listener,

01:34:03.528 --> 01:34:05.861
someone that always
has your back

01:34:05.863 --> 01:34:07.799

right next to you.

- Alright. You ready?
- Let's do it, Dad.

01:34:54.445 --> 01:34:56.912
Okay. So, one time me
and Silent Bob went

01:34:56.914 --> 01:34:59.482
to this mall, right? And then,
a couple of years later,

01:34:59.484 --> 01:35:03.355
we fought these renegade angels
and met God herself.

01:35:03.787 --> 01:35:06.188
And even though me
and Silent Bob saved the world,

01:35:06.190 --> 01:35:08.527
all these Catholics got
pissed off at us anyway.

01:35:09.194 --> 01:35:10.996

All right. Anyways,
after all that angel stuff,

01:35:20.238 --> 01:35:22.504
me and Silent Bob went
to Hollywood.

01:35:22.506 --> 01:35:24.473
That was the first time we went
to Hollywood

01:35:24.475 --> 01:35:27.677
where we met your mom
and a monkey named Suzanne.

01:35:27.679 --> 01:35:30.946
Yeah. She still sends us
Christmas cards every year.

My mom?

01:35:32.117 --> 01:35:35.585
No, the monkey. Oh, and then
the Quik Stop burned down,

01:35:35.587 --> 01:35:38.924
which is right around the time
me and Silent Bob went to rehab.

01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:40.559
Why'd you guys go to rehab?

01:35:41.493 --> 01:35:45.928

Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,

01:37:47.452 --> 01:37:48.651
and you're a huge character...

01:37:48.653 --> 01:37:50.053
- Wonderful.
- ...in the whole thing.

01:37:50.055 --> 01:37:51.387
- Oh, great, I can't wait.
- So, we're...

01:37:51.389 --> 01:37:52.621
I'm... I'm put... Doing it here,

01:37:52.623 --> 01:37:53.522
- so, you have to...
- Right.

01:37:53.524 --> 01:37:54.657
...agree to do the movie.

01:37:54.659 --> 01:37:57.393
Can't we do a little of it now
and stop wasting time?

01:37:57.395 --> 01:37:58.727
- Go to that place.
- All right. Here we go.

01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:59.731
- Action.
- Action.

in one movie,

01:38:17.082 --> 01:38:18.815

01:38:24.622 --> 01:38:26.525
Hey, fella.
How do I get to Comic-Con?

01:38:31.595 --> 01:38:32.829
Oh, you don't talk?

01:38:33.966 --> 01:38:36.165
- That's the smart thing.
- Get the hell out of my scene

01:38:36.167 --> 01:38:37.503
and get me Jay.

01:38:40.671 --> 01:38:43.839

Me and Silent Bob modeled

01:38:43.841 --> 01:38:46.541

from a Hollywood

01:38:55.487 --> 01:38:57.256
- motion picture company.
- Hollywood, Florida?

01:38:57.855 --> 01:39:00.223
Hollywood, California.

01:39:00.225 --> 01:39:01.290
Oh, that one?

01:39:01.292 --> 01:39:03.159
Two tickets to Hollywood.

01:39:03.161 --> 01:39:06.265
- Hollywood, Florida?
- No, Hollywood, California.

01:39:06.698 --> 01:39:07.696
Oh.

01:39:07.698 --> 01:39:09.598
Says here you're supposed to go
to Hollywood?

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.299
You mean Hollywood, Florida?

01:39:11.301 --> 01:39:12.837
No. Hollywood, California.

01:39:14.905 --> 01:39:18.508
Jay and Silent Bob, uh, spent
so much time on themselves

01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:19.875
that they should pay us rent.

01:39:19.877 --> 01:39:22.577
I knew I'd get you.

01:39:22.579 --> 01:39:24.546
Why are you prosecuting?
You should be a stand-up.

01:39:24.548 --> 01:39:25.682
I have a show this weekend.

01:39:25.684 --> 01:39:27.549
- I'll definitely come out.
- Okay, great. I'm gonna...

01:39:27.551 --> 01:39:29.287
- I'll text you later.
- Can I object?

01:39:29.787 --> 01:39:32.621
Ooh, my daughter, Banner,
she's fighting with Renee

01:39:32.623 --> 01:39:34.589
and keeps sending
the most delicious texts.

01:39:34.591 --> 01:39:37.727
Listen. "Dear Sega Boy."
Snoogans.

01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:40.662
"How am I supposed to grow
as a woman when Mom is always

01:39:40.664 --> 01:39:42.430
standing on my fucking dick?"

01:39:42.432 --> 01:39:44.834
- Wait, your daughter has a dick?
- No.

01:39:44.836 --> 01:39:47.202
But she sure can be one
to her mom and I love it.

01:39:47.204 --> 01:39:50.272
You see, kids, teenagers
are like The Incredible Hulk.

01:39:50.274 --> 01:39:53.843
Normal one minute,
a rage of emotions the next.

01:39:53.845 --> 01:39:56.344
You'll see one day when one
of you guys has a kid.

01:39:56.346 --> 01:39:57.448
Probably the quiet one.

01:39:57.881 --> 01:40:00.451
Shit. No female swipes right
on Groot here.

01:40:00.918 --> 01:40:03.785
And I was always so worried that
I would get a female pregnant.

01:40:03.787 --> 01:40:05.854
When I did have sex,
I'd pull out,

01:40:05.856 --> 01:40:07.790
run to the other side
of the room,

01:40:07.792 --> 01:40:10.326
and I bust a nut
in my jacket pocket,

01:40:10.328 --> 01:40:11.561
just to be safe.

01:40:11.563 --> 01:40:14.597
How High is the greatest
movie ever made.

01:40:14.599 --> 01:40:17.767
Me and Silent Bob modeled our
whole fucking lives after it.

01:40:17.769 --> 01:40:18.968
Okay, wait a minute. Are we...

01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:21.340
Are we talking about the same
How High here? The movie?

01:40:22.306 --> 01:40:23.705
The one we're in?

01:40:23.707 --> 01:40:25.641
Yeah, the one we was in,
goddammit.

01:40:25.643 --> 01:40:27.910
See? I told your black ass

01:40:27.912 --> 01:40:30.649
that How High would age
like a fine Chablis.

01:40:31.248 --> 01:40:34.416
Uh-huh, I'm not a pedophile.
I'm here on the behalf

01:40:34.418 --> 01:40:38.888
of a man you might know,
Mr. J-E-S-E-S, Jesus.

01:40:38.890 --> 01:40:43.326
I'm a Christian vigilante,
they call me the Holy Roller.

01:40:43.328 --> 01:40:45.727
Super cool.

01:40:45.729 --> 01:40:47.629

01:40:47.631 --> 01:40:49.498

this entire trip.

01:40:50.534 --> 01:40:52.171
Especially when he saved
our lives.

01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:54.970
This conversation really
does not pass

01:40:54.972 --> 01:40:56.839
the Bechdel Test right now.

01:40:56.841 --> 01:40:59.808
Holy shit, dude, it's them.
They're here.

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.943
Jersey represent.

01:41:01.945 --> 01:41:03.946
Wait, you don't recognize us?

01:41:03.948 --> 01:41:07.316
You almost beat me up
when I was a kid,

01:41:07.318 --> 01:41:10.622
because I said an unkind word
about Morris Day.

01:41:11.622 --> 01:41:12.821
That's you guys?

01:41:12.823 --> 01:41:14.557
What, do you guys work here
or something?

01:41:14.559 --> 01:41:16.528
Dude, we're the Kush Boys.

01:41:17.261 --> 01:41:19.562
Dude, like, you own
all this stuff.

01:41:19.564 --> 01:41:21.563
Yeah, we took a page
out of your book.

01:41:21.565 --> 01:41:23.031
We stopped buying weed,

01:41:23.033 --> 01:41:25.034
started selling that shit
instead.

01:41:25.036 --> 01:41:27.570
Hey, thanks to you guys,
we are financially thriving

01:41:27.572 --> 01:41:30.639
- in the cannabis space.
- We're weed millionaires.

01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:32.243
So that means we get
some free weed?

01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:35.878
- Fuck, no.
- No, that will be 200 bucks.

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.315
Dude, I've always
wanted to do this.

01:41:37.748 --> 01:41:40.383
"Two hundred bucks, little man."

01:41:40.385 --> 01:41:42.454
"Put that shit in our hands."

01:41:43.287 --> 01:41:44.288
Fair enough.

01:41:46.457 --> 01:41:48.290
Dude, there is more lens flare

01:41:48.292 --> 01:41:50.692
than a J.J. Abrams movie
in here.

01:41:50.694 --> 01:41:52.563
I hate all of these fuckers.

01:41:53.831 --> 01:41:54.833
Hi.

01:41:55.332 --> 01:41:58.334
Um, can my friends and I
cut the line?

01:41:58.336 --> 01:42:00.338
- Fuck no.
- Yeah, what she said.

01:42:01.706 --> 01:42:02.708
Happy Chronic-Con.

01:42:03.274 --> 01:42:05.441
How's The Walking Dead
gonna end?

01:42:05.443 --> 01:42:08.611
Oh, um,
Carol actually eats Daryl?

01:42:08.613 --> 01:42:12.415
Fuck. No...
Carol turns into a walker?

01:42:12.417 --> 01:42:14.886
Uh, no. She just eats Daryl.

01:42:15.353 --> 01:42:17.085
Oh, fuck. Uh, spoilers,

01:42:17.087 --> 01:42:18.553
I'm really sorry about that one.

01:42:18.555 --> 01:42:21.891
Fuck!
What the fuck was that for?

01:42:21.893 --> 01:42:24.026
That's for killing
Glenn and Carl!

01:42:24.028 --> 01:42:25.831
Oh, fuck. Fair enough.

01:42:26.331 --> 01:42:28.664
This reboot is doomed, man.

01:42:28.666 --> 01:42:29.531
Maybe it would've had a chance

01:42:29.533 --> 01:42:30.732
if they got Kevin Smith
from the '90s,

01:42:30.734 --> 01:42:33.304
back when he had the juice
to get Affleck in his movies.

01:42:33.771 --> 01:42:36.571
Ew, wait. Didn't he make
that Jersey Girl movie?

01:42:36.573 --> 01:42:37.906
Yeah, I wasn't a fan,

01:42:37.908 --> 01:42:40.910
but Affleck was the bomb
as Batman, yo.

01:42:40.912 --> 01:42:44.080
Word, bitch! Bat-fleck
like a motherfucker!

01:42:44.082 --> 01:42:46.048
Ah ha! What's up now?

01:42:49.621 --> 01:42:52.620
Oh, hello again. Still just
a hologram, same rules apply.

01:42:52.622 --> 01:42:54.357
Don't fucking touch me.
Now, if you're looking

01:42:54.359 --> 01:42:56.592
for the Bluntman v Chronic
shoot, go left.

01:42:56.594 --> 01:42:59.361
But if you're looking for, uh,
I don't know, some version

01:42:59.363 --> 01:43:02.531
of completing your character
arc and becoming the superdad

01:43:02.533 --> 01:43:04.799
that your daughter never really
knew she had, go right.

01:43:04.801 --> 01:43:07.937
If I was in this movie, um,
I know which way I'd go.

01:43:07.939 --> 01:43:08.972
Straight out the door.

01:43:08.974 --> 01:43:10.839
Let's be honest,
I wouldn't be in this movie,

01:43:10.841 --> 01:43:12.474
I'd never be in
this fucking movie.

01:43:12.476 --> 01:43:13.942
I got, like, 37 franchises

01:43:13.944 --> 01:43:15.844
and honestly, I don't really
need another one.

01:43:15.846 --> 01:43:19.617
Anyway, dishes are done, man.
Here we go, bye-bye. Peace.

01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:22.019
Where do you think you're going?

01:43:23.688 --> 01:43:25.388
Yo, we got badges now.

01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:28.089
"We have badges." Stop
butchering the English language.

01:43:28.091 --> 01:43:30.925
And I don't care.
You're getting the bum's rush.

01:43:30.927 --> 01:43:33.862
Wait. Are you a chocolate fan?

01:43:33.864 --> 01:43:36.531
Not that it'll change
your fortunes one iota,

01:43:36.533 --> 01:43:40.702
but since I'm not a Nazi robot,
yes, I like chocolate.

01:43:40.704 --> 01:43:44.643
Well, this is the best chocolate
in the whole wide world.

01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:46.611
Bullshit.

01:43:48.145 --> 01:43:49.380
Give me that.

01:43:52.182 --> 01:43:53.618
Punch, edible's...

01:43:55.685 --> 01:43:56.852
Holy fucking shit.

01:43:56.854 --> 01:43:58.086
Where did these people
come from?

01:43:58.088 --> 01:44:00.423
Hey, kids! What the fuck
is going on here?

01:44:00.425 --> 01:44:01.723
They're the contest winners.

01:44:01.725 --> 01:44:03.526
Their prize is a walk-on
in the movie.

01:44:03.528 --> 01:44:05.428
- This movie?
- Yeah.

01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:07.028
They should have held out
for a way better movie,

01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:08.129
- am I right?
- I totally agree.

01:44:08.131 --> 01:44:09.231
Man, fuck you.

01:44:09.233 --> 01:44:13.067
Hey, kids! Man, I'm gonna find
a way to get you all

01:44:13.069 --> 01:44:16.805
into an uncuttable cameo
in the movie, man.

01:44:16.807 --> 01:44:18.840
All right. Emily, fuck off!
We're trying to take a picture.

01:44:18.842 --> 01:44:21.979
All right, kids. All smiles,
big, wide eyes. Here we go.

01:44:27.051 --> 01:44:28.720
Excuse me. Hey, kid!

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:31.486
You ruined
my fucking movie career,

01:44:31.488 --> 01:44:32.955
- you know that?
- Um, I've seen

01:44:32.957 --> 01:44:34.190
your flicks, Smitticles.

01:44:34.192 --> 01:44:36.058
You killed
your own movie career.

01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:38.497
Oh, my God, you little monster.
Who raised you?

01:44:44.502 --> 01:44:46.004
I'm so done with Kevin Smith.

01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:50.142
Fuck.

01:44:51.141 --> 01:44:53.041
Oh, you see that guy over there?

01:44:53.043 --> 01:44:56.010
For 25 years, we've been coming
here every night

01:44:56.012 --> 01:44:57.515
and putting gum in the locks.
