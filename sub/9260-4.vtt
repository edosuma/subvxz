WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:03.195
Previously on The Shield.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.709
- I have an attorney for you.
- I'm Becca Doyle.

00:05.920 --> 00:08.912
If everything hinges on her,
I'd be a fool to give up that hammer.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.838
You were foolish
for letting me know...

00:11.040 --> 00:13.873
...how important she is
to making your case.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.229
You looking for more business?

00:15.440 --> 00:17.556
Right now I'd like to go home.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.149
Has anyone from the department
been asking questions?

00:20.360 --> 00:21.759
Someone has been.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.030
He said he was a parent
of an autistic child.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.639
- That him?
- Yeah.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.270
Pitarrio, where's your stash?

00:29.880 --> 00:33.077
About six months ago,
we found this kilo of pure heroin...

00:33.280 --> 00:36.352
...in your car,
but you never logged it into evidence.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.632
Lem got picked up by IAD.
They got him wearing a wire.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.910
I'm going after Mackey.
And his team.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.156
And I'm gonna make sure
you don't blow it.

00:44.360 --> 00:47.511
We got a CI next to him,
and when he jumps dirty, we'll know.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.269
- Here.
- It's okay, I'm on the clock.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.391
I thought you were Vic's CI.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.591
Whoever's got the money.

00:55.920 --> 00:56.875
Check, one, two.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.557
Good. That's good.

01:00.760 --> 01:04.230
Hey. I need admissions
from Mackey and the others...

01:04.440 --> 01:05.919
...on crimes they've committed.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.156
Questions make cops suspicious.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.715
You walk out the room
every time he opens his mouth.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.559
- You think I haven't noticed this?
- I'm just doing my job.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.196
- Vic and I aren't attached at the hip.
- Well, then get attached.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.790
Because dragging this out,
trying to have it both ways...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.956
...you're torturing yourself.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.515
You made your choice.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.755
It was the right one.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.756
Now you gotta start living with it.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.356
Hold on a second, okay? Please.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.238
I know it's your birthday.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.279
You mentioned that you're a fly-fisher
on one of the tapes.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.038
Thanks.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.959
We're gonna be working together for
a while, you know...

02:05.160 --> 02:07.230
I know this is tough.

02:08.520 --> 02:14.436
But we're both gonna make our way
through all of this, right?

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.040 --> 02:30.508
I would have pegged you
for a corner office.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.429
First time a police officer's
stepped foot in here.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.437
- I've got a case.
- My schedule's full.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.995
And I've been finding my own cases
since I was 30.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.553
Not like this one.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.195
Five minutes.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.952
Everything I'm about to say
falls under attorney-client privilege.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.913
Yeah, but it doesn't obligate me
to take your case.

02:52.120 --> 02:56.079
IAD's launched an investigation into
one of the guys on my Strike Team.

02:56.680 --> 03:00.355
I don't represent cops.
Especially corrupt ones.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.391
We're good cops.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.393
This is about the system
turning its back on four of its own.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.999
You'd better go somewhere else.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.749
You shuffle gangbangers
in and out of jail all day.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.517
This is a chance for you to take a shot
at the big boys.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.473
What do they have on him?

03:19.680 --> 03:22.956
Claim they found a brick of tar
in his glove compartment. It's bullshit.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.550
The only thing I know for sure is that
they're going after my whole team.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.352
Guy named Kavanaugh's in charge.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.279
I'd dig into it myself,
but it would raise too many flags.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.550
There's the first real truth
I've heard.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.433
You wanna keep your knowledge
of the investigation secret.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.471
No one would suspect
I'm working for you.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.671
So we agree
that you work for me then.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.759
I've got an old boyfriend
in the City Attorney's office.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.157
I'll ask a couple questions,
but that's it.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.510
Fiji, Barbados,
all those tropical vacation places...

04:00.720 --> 04:02.472
...you're talking typhoons.

04:02.680 --> 04:05.240
- I'm just looking out for you.
- Look out for the tape.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.637
- Angle looks car to car.
- Bumper's got a dent, could be fresh.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.956
So maybe there's an incident
out on the road...

04:16.160 --> 04:18.879
...someone in the other car shoots,
victim veers off here.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.315
Oh, Christ.

04:23.480 --> 04:27.268
Get additional units down here.
Tell Danny I said now.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.232
Umbilical cord.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.873
Checked the Amber Alert requirements.
We don't have enough.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.435
Somebody cut that baby
out of a woman's stomach.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.471
Get a witness,
a description of the car.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.353
If they wanted the child, why
pump the mother with bullets?

04:50.560 --> 04:52.710
Someone wanted it to look random.
The boyfriend?

04:52.920 --> 04:53.875
What do we know?

04:54.080 --> 04:56.389
Works in a shop.
Hasn't been home since the murder.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.875
I've got unis stationed at the house.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.197
- The vultures are gathering.
- I'll get rid of them.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.358
Wait, wait. No, no, no. Let's use them.
Somebody knows something.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.278
We just need to pull
the right strings.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.040
All right, good.
You keep working, I'll do it.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.834
Wilshire's not giving us any bodies
for the search team.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.792
Not if we can't prove the baby's alive.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.959
That's bullshit. Call again.
No, I'll call.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.276
Who would do something like this?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.950
- What did the ex have to say?
- Absolutely nothing.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.230
I called a couple ADA's
I went to school with.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.556
- Quiet on all fronts.
- Good.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.274
Not good. None of them offered
to look into it for me...

05:33.480 --> 05:36.870
...which means they know
something major's in motion.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.670
What haven't you told me?

05:39.880 --> 05:41.996
David Aceveda's name come up
with your friends?

05:42.200 --> 05:43.315
The City Councilman?

05:43.520 --> 05:46.193
He's assisting Kavanaugh
with his investigation.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.594
Why?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.238
Because he used to be captain here.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.556
Had me pushing the legal line
a couple times...

05:52.760 --> 05:55.069
...when it meant getting a killer
off the street...

05:55.280 --> 05:56.998
...making him look good to the voters.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.590
Overseeing the investigation means
he can steer it away from himself...

06:00.800 --> 06:03.394
...make me and my guys
play the heavies.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.318
Starting to get
your blood running yet?

06:05.520 --> 06:08.478
I'm interested in this heroin
they caught Lemansky with.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.114
- What does he say about it?
- Haven't been able to ask.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.880
IAD's got him all wired up,
listening to our every word.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.676
Well, they wouldn't make that move
unless they had a witness or evidence.

06:19.240 --> 06:23.631
- I'll find out what I can.
- Good. Me too.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.679
So the kid's about, well, here, right?

06:31.880 --> 06:36.078
The knife goes in, goes straight down,
gotta be careful about the depth.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.271
I'd say you wouldn't need
medical training.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.835
So I tell the news we're not
looking for Einstein...

06:41.040 --> 06:43.110
...just a psychopath,
possibly a woman.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.470
Usually it's a woman who's
lost a baby...

06:45.680 --> 06:47.113
...or is claiming to be pregnant.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.595
I'm never gonna sleep
until I have this kid.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.792
- You're not gonna sleep then either.
- Thanks.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.352
911 received a call
at 5: 17 this morning.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.632
From a payphone one block
from the scene. They hung up.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.513
That could be our line to the baby.
How we gonna find them?

07:02.720 --> 07:05.029
You've gotta convince them
to come to us.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.789
- Need another cup?
- Two should do it.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.549
Hey, we on that missing baby yet?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.032
No, Dutch and Claudette
are handling it.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.915
Captain wants us available to round up
all the other miscellaneous sickos.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.952
Listen, man, I'll be back in a few.
I gonna take a dump.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.037
Smells like you already did.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.832
We got five minutes to hear
what's going on with Kavanaugh.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.110
- Every detail.
- He suspects I'm protecting you.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.718
I've been helpful, but not too helpful.
Nothing he can check out.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.878
Any chance he's got a witness?
Someone who saw you take that tar?

07:48.080 --> 07:49.513
Shit. Pitarrio.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.188
Or Emolia.
I mean, she was in the house too.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.789
I got a six-month relationship
with her. She's solid.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.912
- Pitarrio's the one.
- Lf they got Pitarrio, I'm screwed.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.156
We don't know that,
but we're gonna find out.

08:00.360 --> 08:04.399
No, he puts that heroin in my car,
makes IAD's case, what then?

08:07.280 --> 08:10.590
First-time offender, you'd do, what,
five years max, probably less?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.836
- Shane.
- Look, I'm just... I'm just saying.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.754
Worst case scenario,
you refuse to wear the wire...

08:15.960 --> 08:17.473
...you let Kavanaugh arrest you.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.793
We'll work behind the scenes
to undermine him.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.313
- You'll seal us off from this, right?
- The shit you've done...

08:24.520 --> 08:27.034
...and I'm the one going to jail?
- Nobody's going away.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.835
- Hasn't been a jam we haven't slipped.
- Hasn't been a witness or an IAD cop.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.395
Nobody jumped ship
when Antwon had your balls.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.636
I was willing to put a bullet into Antwon
to keep it off of you.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.871
We got you out of that
before you had to.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.152
Which is exactly what we're gonna do
for Lem. But if we can't...

08:44.440 --> 08:46.271
...you're gonna look out for us, right?

08:52.200 --> 08:56.478
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.318
We're gonna get you clear of this.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.949
Ronnie and I'll track down Pitarrio
and we'll squeeze his balls.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.149
I hate this.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.635
Don't worry, we got you.
Let's get the wire back on.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.308
What person cuts a baby
out of its mother's stomach?

09:12.520 --> 09:14.476
The kind that should have been
an abortion.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.759
There's the man.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.712
- Give me a sec.
- For what?

09:19.920 --> 09:22.388
Aceveda's been updating me
on a few things.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.555
Be right back.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.834
Councilman. A moment of your time.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.358
What is it?

09:34.320 --> 09:36.675
Some asshole dumped a few couches
over on Benton...

09:36.880 --> 09:42.637
...I got a La-Z-Boy over on Scott.
Bums find that out, it's a Motel 6.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.513
You screeched up here to talk to me
about trash pickups?

09:45.720 --> 09:47.597
Six Paul 11, Six Paul 11.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.553
Billings is too squirrelly to ask the city
for an extra dime.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.116
- Someone's gotta do it.
- Hey, we got a 187.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.996
Anyway, Farmington's garbage
is your area.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.829
That's a little below my pay grade.
Call someone in Waste Removal.

10:03.040 --> 10:07.591
Okay. But I'd hate to see your
entire district become a fire hazard.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.159
- Get what you need?
- Yeah, he was very helpful.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.191
The car was headed south.
Down there.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.834
Hank Preminger.
Explorer came around the corner...

10:21.040 --> 10:23.270
...started blasting at him
as he exited the diner.

10:23.480 --> 10:24.435
Nice piece.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.871
Let this be a cautionary tale.
You find our heroin dealer?

10:28.080 --> 10:30.150
Pitarrio cleared out.
He's a ghost.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.828
Only sign of life
was a couple of squatter crackheads.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.395
Hey. Telephone worker
got a bird's eye from the pole.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.272
- He get a plate for the SUV?
- No.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.710
But he gave unis a partial plate
on a witness.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.151
Another white guy, jumped in his ride
after the shooting, took off.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.998
All right. You guys work your angle.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.431
Lem and I'll figure out who's got
a problem with the Hair Club for Men.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.595
All right, Vic.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.519
That baby is still out there.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.633
This disgusting crime occurred at
approximately 5: 15 a.m. This morning.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.718
So we beg you,
while the baby can still be saved...

10:59.920 --> 11:01.956
...please call if you have any
information...

11:02.160 --> 11:06.199
...about the traffic altercation that led
to the murder of Isabel Arrington.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.436
We need you to call our tip line.
Time is of...

11:08.640 --> 11:10.676
I pulled the records
of every single person...

11:10.880 --> 11:13.110
...who worked with Isabel Arrington.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.038
So far just petty stuff.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.231
Here's our grieving boyfriend.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.429
Your neighbour told us
Isabel was screwing somebody else.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.437
- Bullshit.
- Baby probably wasn't yours.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.279
Don't you say that.
You goddamn liar.

11:26.480 --> 11:31.110
- Lf the baby's alive, tell us.
- Oh, God.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.752
- Please let him be alive.
- It's a boy?

11:33.960 --> 11:37.157
You notice that when you cut him
out of Isabel's stomach?

11:37.360 --> 11:39.590
We did one of those scans.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.716
We saw his stuff.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.639
You gotta believe me.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.235
Okay. We'll get somebody
to give you a ride home.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.476
Stay by the phone.
I may have more questions.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.672
You accuse me of slicing my baby
out of my girl's stomach...

11:57.880 --> 12:00.678
...and now you want me to go home
and wait on you?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.719
- We're sorry for your loss.
- I don't want your apologies.

12:03.920 --> 12:09.438
I want you to find out who did this
to her and where my baby is.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.876
Victim did a stint in Lompoc
eight years ago.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.832
Been clean ever since.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.874
No family, but coworkers at
the pet store said he's got no enemies.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.435
These matches to the partial plate
on the witness?

12:22.640 --> 12:26.519
I've ruled out 50 of them.
Got about a half-dozen possibles here.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.831
Pitarrio hasn't been arrested
in six months.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.235
That's the longest he's gone
since he turned 18.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.759
He's off the grid.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.793
If the feds picked him up
and he made a deal to give up Lem...

12:40.000 --> 12:42.468
...that arrest wouldn't show up
on his record.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.633
Check this out. Leon Frankel lives
in the same building as our victim.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.798
Turns out they both got their GEDs
in Lompoc.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.036
Well, let's find out
why Hank's study buddy...

12:53.240 --> 12:55.595
...didn't stick around
to talk to the police.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.156
We looking at this guy as a coward
or suspect?

12:59.360 --> 13:02.989
Whichever jacket fits.
Hold on, hold on.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.590
- Is that Leon Frankel?
- That's me.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.552
We were looking for him.
What did he do?

13:09.760 --> 13:12.558
We were canvassing. He threw a bottle,
cracked the windshield.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.354
Then he asked if he could smell
my sweet spot.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.437
Even Shane stopped using that line.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.798
Pretty stupid way
to get yourself arrested, Leon.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.069
I had a bad day.

13:22.280 --> 13:25.431
That bad day include seeing
your pal Hank Preminger shot dead?

13:26.480 --> 13:29.916
A friend of mine was in trouble, I'd do
everything I could to help him out.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.392
Sit down.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.637
I was scared, I heard shots, I ran.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.994
Look, maybe if I sit here for a while,
something will come to me.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.831
You're walking down the street
with your enemy-free friend, Hank.

13:46.040 --> 13:49.715
Shots go off, he's dead. But you know
those bullets were meant for you.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.592
Now you're not safe.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.598
You're too damn cheap
to spend 20 bucks on a fleabag motel.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.917
You get yourself arrested because
it's safer in here than out there.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.270
Only we're not your goddamn
bodyguards.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.072
Who did it?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.555
I don't know.

14:05.520 --> 14:06.475
Get out.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.753
- What?
- Get out. Get out.

14:13.160 --> 14:17.312
Now, wait a second.
I remember a green SUV.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.670
Great. Think of anything else,
give us a call.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.871
I'm releasing Leon
on his own recognizance.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.594
- Wait, he's supposed to post bail.
- I'm overriding bail.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.951
- You're gonna get me killed.
- That's a chance I'm willing to take.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.913
Okay, okay.
Come on, please.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.317
Couple days ago, I had a client
fell behind on his payments.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.637
Awesome pool player.
Now, I knew this guy, right?

14:37.840 --> 14:41.799
He did me a solid back in the day.
We used to hang out at Gary's Tavern...

14:42.000 --> 14:44.468
Cut to the part
where someone wants to kill you.

14:45.520 --> 14:49.149
My boss, Gus, wanted me
to take a crowbar to his right arm...

14:49.360 --> 14:52.238
...and if I did that,
his break would never be the same.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.076
So I gave him an extra 24 hours.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.158
Most loan sharks don't take too kindly
to independent thinking.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.158
Gus never would have known,
but this prick disappears...

15:01.360 --> 15:03.476
...with the 40 large he owes.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.956
Now Gus thinks we split the money,
and he wants me dead.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.754
And your friend Hank
takes the hit meant for you.

15:11.520 --> 15:15.672
- I feel like shit about that.
- Who shot at you?

15:15.880 --> 15:18.997
I'll bet you anything it was
that little ass-suck works for Gus.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.270
He's always trying to hone in
on my business.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.710
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.751
I just call him ass-suck.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.311
Excuse me while I get a Kleenex
for the rest of this sob story.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.112
It's a protection game.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.470
I got all these young guys
coming up behind me.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.636
It's like no one wants Leon
to get ahead.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.798
- Jesus, what took so long?
- I had to track Pitarrio through INS.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.833
Miguelez Construction registered his
social security number...

15:44.040 --> 15:45.268
...two months ago.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.755
- Scumbag got a real job?
- Working on Hillhurst.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.838
If Pitarrio's breaking a sweat,
we know he's into the feds.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.439
Let me wrap this up.

15:55.120 --> 16:00.433
Hey. You're early. So am I.

16:01.760 --> 16:02.954
How's Andy?

16:03.160 --> 16:06.436
He's good, actually. He's inside.

16:06.640 --> 16:10.758
I was wondering, how old was Andy
when he was diagnosed?

16:10.960 --> 16:12.632
Around 3.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.628
There's an Andy at this school,
but he's not your son.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.549
What's going on? When were you
planning on telling me you're a cop?

16:20.760 --> 16:22.239
- Who told you that?
- Nobody.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.079
I was married to one.
I see them every day in the ER.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.952
You all walk the same.

16:28.400 --> 16:34.794
Yeah, we do. I'm a lieutenant. IAD.
You'd make a good detective, Corrine.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.356
I don't know what you want, or why
you've been lying to me, but stay away.

16:38.560 --> 16:42.075
Miss Mackey. Your husband
and his team are under investigation.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.111
So what? I was his wife,
not his partner.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.117
I don't know
what your involvement is...

16:46.320 --> 16:48.515
...but you and I are gonna do
a lot more talking.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.599
And you mention anything to him
about me or this investigation...

16:52.800 --> 16:54.233
...it is obstruction of justice.

16:54.440 --> 16:59.195
So I find out that you told him, that
he learned anything about this case...

16:59.400 --> 17:02.836
...it's on you and that's prison.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.757
We'll talk later.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.079
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't a baby,
just so you know.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.919
It's very generous of you.
Could you tell us what you saw?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.873
That pregnant lady decided
she had to turn all of a sudden.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.116
Almost drove into that other car.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.880
Other car... Think it was white.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.992
- Goes honking, gets crazy,
starts shooting.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.636
911 put me on hold.
Five-thirty in the morning.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.875
So I hung up.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.640
You said you saw something on
the car? That could help?

17:35.840 --> 17:38.718
The white car had one of those decals
on the back window.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.989
What did the decal say?

17:40.200 --> 17:44.830
"Jevontrey." I have a nephew named
Devontrey, so I remembered the decal.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.996
It was one of those R.I.P. Ones.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.676
Kind that should have been
an abortion.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.878
There's the man.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.559
- Give me a second.
- For what?

17:56.760 --> 17:59.513
Aceveda's been updating me
on a few things.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.312
Be right back.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.432
Councilman, a moment of your time.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.115
Come in.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.835
You said you have an update.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.673
Lemansky's birthday's today.

18:17.880 --> 18:21.350
His pals, they either don't know
or just don't care.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.115
That's the update?

18:23.320 --> 18:26.915
My best friend forgot my birthday,
I'd be pissed.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.190
This could be a way in.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.436
Anything interesting happen
with you today?

18:36.640 --> 18:37.834
Like what?

18:38.520 --> 18:41.592
Like visitors?

18:42.640 --> 18:44.949
- Mackey?
- He came by the office.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.758
What about?

18:48.440 --> 18:50.317
Some bullshit sanitation complaint.

18:50.520 --> 18:54.479
He just wants to shove it in my face
that he's de facto running the Barn.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.195
You didn't call him?

18:56.400 --> 18:58.709
Don't have regular sit-down meetings
with him?

18:59.680 --> 19:03.832
Just trying to figure out which uniform
you're wearing, councilman.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.679
Well, it sure as hell isn't Mackey's.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.270
Sorry for getting you down here.

19:09.920 --> 19:14.391
Next time I have a birthday alert,
I'll just call you on the phone.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.119
You're not safe here anymore.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.072
I'm taking you.
We gotta go. Gotta move.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.748
- Why? What happened?
- Got a couple of possible leaks.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.757
Get your stuff,
whatever Sebastio needs.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.838
- You said Vic wouldn't find out.
- I'm not saying that he has.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.190
Either way, he calls,
you don't answer.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.311
He comes by,
you're not gonna even be here.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.513
The volume on this thing
just got turned way up. Let's go.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.958
Pitarrio.

20:05.640 --> 20:09.838
- Yes, I am Pitarrio.
- Nice try, dickwad. We know the guy.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.075
Where is he?

20:12.280 --> 20:15.431
- Give me your papers.
- Let's see them. Let's see it.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.518
All right, you got a job off this.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.349
- What did Pitarrio get for his papers?
- He got dead.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.595
- Dead?
- What?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.119
You sure he's not laying low?

20:24.320 --> 20:26.709
Taking a cut
off your hard-earned money, huh?

20:26.920 --> 20:32.313
No. Three months ago we were down
in El Salvador, doing a heroin deal.

20:32.520 --> 20:37.275
The Sombra Negra, it got to him
and it sliced his neck in half.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.950
Look, you gotta consider Emolia.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.869
They might have some other kind of
corroborating evidence against Lem.

20:46.520 --> 20:50.559
She's got a messed-up kid.
She's got no job.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.715
IAD offers her a deal,
she could've jumped at it.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.309
I've spent time with this girl.
And the boy.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.511
She's not gonna turn on me.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.632
Well, just call her, then. Check in.

21:04.120 --> 21:08.318
Emolia. Emolia.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.469
Sir?

21:14.680 --> 21:17.194
Have you seen the woman
who lives here?

21:28.280 --> 21:29.315
Thanks.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.313
I've got every decal place in town
checking special orders.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.431
Meantime, I need
an extra pair of eyes.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.996
Three years of death in LA County.
Holler if you see a Jevontrey.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.835
- Wagenbach.
- Dutch, it's Corrine.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.515
You there?

21:46.720 --> 21:49.439
- Hey. What's...?
- I need to ask you some questions.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.870
Oh, I can't right now.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.196
Please. I'm pulling up now.
It's important.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.350
- Sorry, I didn't know who else to call.
- I can't stay long. What's going on?

21:58.560 --> 21:59.913
Promise this stays between us.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.156
Promise you're gonna give
straight answers...

22:02.360 --> 22:05.238
...no matter what you think of Vic.
- Of course. What is it?

22:05.440 --> 22:07.510
Some IAD guy's been coming
to the school...

22:07.720 --> 22:09.676
...trying to get me to say things
about him.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.156
IAD's into Vic?
I wonder what they got on him.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.590
- I mean, probably, take your pick...
- I don't know.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.509
He's threatened to send me to jail if
I said anything or if I don't cooperate.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.799
I need to know if he's bullshitting.
Can he send me to jail?

22:23.000 --> 22:27.039
Well, a lot of times the person who
goes down didn't do the original crime.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.754
They found out about it afterwards,
lied, covered it up.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.837
Well, what about spousal privilege?

22:32.040 --> 22:34.395
They can't force you to talk,
but if they prove...

22:34.600 --> 22:37.592
...you knew about Vic's actions,
it makes you a co-conspirator.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.997
What's gonna happen to your kids
if something happens to you? You see?

22:41.200 --> 22:44.829
- You're their best leverage against him.
- But I don't know anything.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.589
Well, then take away their leverage.
Be completely upfront and honest.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.760
I'm sorry, I've really gotta go.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.270
Hey, why would someone take
prednisone?

23:00.840 --> 23:05.072
I don't know, a lot of reasons. Arthritis,
lupus, asthma, Crohn's disease.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.714
It's a common anti-inflammatory.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.713
Thanks. I'm sorry.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.596
You don't have to memorize
every picture. Just flip. Flip it, man.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.153
You want me to make a mistake?

23:19.360 --> 23:22.670
Hey, cut the guy some slack, all right?
He's got a target on his back.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.710
Emolia, it's me again.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.393
Got a Salvadoran thing going on.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.154
It's kind of time-sensitive,
so call me back.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.832
- I need some air.
- I'll come with.

23:37.080 --> 23:41.119
That's the guy that works for Gus.
That's ass-suck right there.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.679
Justin Lamott.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.553
Emolia's gone. Neighbour saw her
leave with a black guy.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.789
Kavanaugh.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.395
- You call her cell?
- Three times, including just now.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.868
You're her paycheque.

23:51.080 --> 23:54.072
When's the last time she didn't
call you back in five minutes?

23:54.320 --> 23:57.869
If Kavanaugh got to her somehow,
it's nothing I can't turn around.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.953
Well, he's probably got her stashed
at a safe house somewhere.

24:06.760 --> 24:07.988
Had to start with Pitarrio.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.231
IAD flips him,
shithead ends up dead.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.517
They've got nothing. They go to Emolia,
twist her against her will.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.830
What does she know about
besides the heroin?

24:16.040 --> 24:17.712
Nothing. I've kept her clean.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.390
Is there a chance
Lem's working with these guys?

24:20.600 --> 24:23.717
That's what Kavanaugh wants.
For us to doubt each other.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.433
This guy's using every angle.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.870
Prick talked to Corrine
at our kids' school.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.758
This guy's chatting up your ex?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.831
You think you might
have mentioned that?

24:32.040 --> 24:34.270
I just did. Warn Mara.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.756
Ronnie, tell whatever you're banging
this week, don't talk to strangers.

24:37.960 --> 24:41.157
All I need is five minutes with Emolia
to coach her on what to say...

24:41.360 --> 24:43.112
...let her know
we're there to help her.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.515
We find her,
this whole thing goes away.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.109
Well, how are we gonna find her?

24:49.960 --> 24:53.316
Hey, we got an ID on our shooter.
Justin Lamott. Vehicle matches.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.198
Yeah, better luck than we're having.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.750
We're gonna need to stick Leon in
a safe house until we make the arrests.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.754
All right.
I got a list of available HUD houses.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.477
Yeah, let me see.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.519
These are for captains
and above only.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.910
Captain, they found the baby.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.634
Won't leave your office.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.150
The bones in his chest
are essentially pulverized.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.395
Pulverized? How?

25:34.600 --> 25:36.909
- I'd say a fist.
- Somebody punched a newborn?

25:37.120 --> 25:40.192
Stepped on him, maybe.
There's a variety of trauma.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.550
Skull fracture,
knife wound on the left leg...

25:42.800 --> 25:45.075
- I'll know more later.
- Thanks for the rush.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.834
On this one? Anything you need.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.109
A typhoon in Fiji's
looking pretty good right now.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.588
Did we even have a chance?

25:53.800 --> 25:56.951
- Crime scene says he died hours ago.
- It's a special kind of monster.

25:57.160 --> 25:59.276
Yeah, and that monster's name
is Tevares Glade.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.715
Just got a call back
from a decal place on Pico.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.155
Two years ago,
Tevares placed a special order.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.429
"R.I.P. Jevontrey."

26:05.680 --> 26:08.274
In honour of a dead uncle.
Pulled his record.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.118
Tevares drives a white Monte Carlo.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.954
And has six arrests,
all for violent crimes...

26:15.160 --> 26:16.718
...four of them with a Sean Deeks.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.275
Why do two men cut a baby
out of a woman's stomach...

26:19.480 --> 26:20.959
...just to beat him to death?

26:21.160 --> 26:23.993
There were more than two of them.
Look. In the blood.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.190
Fingerprints.
Jesus, he's covered in them.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.399
The big ones? Tevares Glade
or Sean Deeks. Maybe both.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.312
But the little ones...

26:34.520 --> 26:36.556
You think maybe
there was a girl here too?

26:43.160 --> 26:45.355
Ass-suck, 12 o'clock.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.278
Out of six rounds,
this dude manages...

26:47.480 --> 26:49.357
...four in the wall,
two in the wrong guy.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.551
Loan shark should have
hired a professional.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.756
Some shit to be dealing with
on my birthday.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.070
It's your birthday?
We should get wasted, man.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.599
- Yeah.
- Hey, buddy.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.030
- Hey.
- You... You Justin?

27:00.240 --> 27:01.434
- Why?
- Why?

27:01.640 --> 27:05.155
Gus sent us. He's pissed off about
the way things went down this morning.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.432
- You shot the wrong guy.
- I seen the prick hit the ground.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.154
His friend hit the ground.
You just confessed to murder.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.670
Wanna spare yourself,
tell us where to find Gus.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.353
- Gus.
- All right. All right.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.316
Justin ID'd the loan shark.
Got them both.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.438
- You tell Leon he's in the clear?
- Yeah, freak tried to hug me.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.153
But you insisted on the blowjob.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.631
Must have ate something this morning.
Third time I gotta shit today.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.638
Be sure to inform us of number four.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.030
All right, look.
Pitarrio's a dead end. Literally.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.635
Kavanaugh's gonna try
to get Emolia to give you up.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.796
- I don't think she saw me take the H.
- Good.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.838
Meantime, Vic's convinced a little TLC
puts her on our side.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.514
Kavanaugh finds out we got to her,
this blows up.

27:52.760 --> 27:53.909
We even know where she is?

27:54.160 --> 27:57.197
Ronnie and I checked out
the safe houses. Came up empty.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.749
But her son has occupational therapy
twice a week.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.560
Emolia won't let
Sebastio miss those.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.875
I chased down this therapist's
unfaithful wife...

28:06.080 --> 28:08.116
...in exchange for sessions
for Emolia's kid.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.469
What do you want me to do?

28:09.680 --> 28:13.275
Put on your wire, head home,
kick back your feet, have a beer.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.152
Kavanaugh's turning up the heat.

28:16.120 --> 28:19.476
We think he might be planning
to formally arrest you.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.996
That happens,
we'll be ready to bail you out.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.312
Hey, I need you two guys.

28:32.840 --> 28:36.389
This old man here.
He's been waiting here for hours.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.473
Some asshole's moving
around the hood in a camper trailer.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.797
The guy sets up streamers, flags.
Whole thing's very patriotic.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.788
He's selling care packages and bogus
body armour to our troops in Iraq.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.514
Grandpa here paid 300 bucks
for a state-of-the-art vest.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.115
His grandson called,
told him he got it in the mail...

28:52.320 --> 28:54.231
- Let me guess. Piece of shit.
- Yep.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.717
Go pull a car.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.476
Glad to see you two kids
are working it out.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.755
Yeah.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.678
Your PR instructor said
you weren't in class the other night.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.957
Something about almost having
to blow a van full of skin pedlars...

29:12.160 --> 29:14.594
...made me wanna go home
and drink a bottle of wine.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.995
I wasn't up for baton training
that night.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.191
So you missed a class
with no valid excuse.

29:19.920 --> 29:24.232
I took three classes already.
And when exactly do you lay off?

29:24.440 --> 29:28.149
When I feel safe riding with you.
There's our patriot.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.754
Put him in the cage.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.275
All right, officer.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.232
What's a little bit like you doing
being a cop?

29:47.880 --> 29:50.110
Put your hands on top of your head.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.199
What'd he do? Is he a murderer?

30:03.160 --> 30:05.754
Hey. Listen, I know we're short-handed
and everything...

30:05.960 --> 30:08.155
...but do you think
I can get reassigned?

30:08.360 --> 30:09.509
You want a different T. O?

30:09.760 --> 30:13.230
- I've tried with Julien, I really have...
- Look, there's murderers in here.

30:13.440 --> 30:17.672
And rapists and shit.
I can't be in here with murderers.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.077
- I've taken three baton classes...
- I'm just a drunk.

30:21.280 --> 30:25.034
- It's Julien. He keeps checking on me.
- You gotta have a room or something.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.310
We don't have a room.
This isn't an inn.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.397
This guy's here for resisting arrest.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.556
And this guy's here
for scamming grandpas...

30:31.760 --> 30:35.230
...into buying bogus body armour
for their grandkids over in Iraq.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.079
No murderers.
So don't get your panties in a bunch.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.634
Same goes for you.

30:43.720 --> 30:47.269
Found your fingerprints on the baby,
Tevares. Dried in the mother's blood.

30:47.480 --> 30:50.438
Sean and Tevares killed that lady
so you could have the baby.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.518
And then what?
It got too much for you to handle.

30:53.720 --> 30:57.998
He cried too much.
So you let them beat him to death.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.953
We also have your friends.
We've got their fingerprints.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.873
Pretty soon,
one of them's gonna start to talk.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.515
Attorney says they found the baby
in a dumpster.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.711
Fingerprints mean
they tried to revive it.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.679
- Think the girl's the way to go?
- She's our best shot.

31:16.920 --> 31:20.674
- Want me to give it a run?
- I've got someone else in mind.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.354
I feel him.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.516
Like right here.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.876
It's his foot. You wanna touch it?

31:31.960 --> 31:34.269
You know,
I didn't even ever really want a baby.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.668
But now...

31:38.760 --> 31:40.910
You're too young
to know what I'm talking about.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.236
All those maternal feelings and all.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.800
Which is why I'm thinking
that you did the cutting.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.996
- No.
- Oh, come on.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.351
Those idiots you're hooked up with
wouldn't know how to make a baby...

31:52.560 --> 31:54.994
...much less
cut one out of somebody.

32:03.880 --> 32:09.159
Feel it? That man lost his baby son,
his girlfriend...

32:09.400 --> 32:11.516
Bitch brought that on herself.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.113
Is that why you wanted that baby?

32:15.360 --> 32:17.669
You didn't think she'd be
a good enough mother?

32:18.840 --> 32:21.115
Shit, we didn't even know
she was pregnant.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.072
When you shot her?

32:23.280 --> 32:26.238
She almost ran us off the road.
My man don't stand for that.

32:26.440 --> 32:33.118
She almost killed us, so shooting her
was like, self-defence, right?

32:33.320 --> 32:37.393
We didn't see the belly until she got
out the car and started trying to run.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.593
They was just gonna drive off...

32:39.840 --> 32:42.479
...but I said,
"No. We gotta save the baby."

32:43.120 --> 32:44.997
They was thinking
they was gonna sell it.

32:45.200 --> 32:49.512
But my sister, Myesha, she had
two abortions when she was my age.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.551
Now she wants a baby...

32:51.800 --> 32:56.112
...but those doctors messed up
something in there and so...

32:56.360 --> 32:58.715
...I thought maybe
she could take him.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.078
But the baby wasn't breathing right.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.317
So we did the stuff
you see on doctor shows.

33:04.520 --> 33:08.069
We cleared out his mouth
and turned him upside down.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.029
But that didn't work, did it?

33:12.840 --> 33:15.070
So I made Tevares do that CPR stuff...

33:15.280 --> 33:18.636
...but the minute he pressed down...

33:20.360 --> 33:22.715
...we heard everything crack.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.193
That's enough.

33:25.400 --> 33:29.393
- We was just trying to save him.
- You know what... Just stop talking.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.994
They've given Kavanaugh carte blanche
to work your case.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.918
Any resources he needs.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.672
What's Kavanaugh
trying to nail you for?

33:45.920 --> 33:48.229
Because this isn't about
some misplaced heroin.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.353
Aceveda and the Department
need a poster boy for corruption...

33:53.600 --> 33:57.229
...to sell their softer, gentler force
to the voters.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.311
Why pick you as a scapegoat?

33:59.560 --> 34:01.471
You're a push-the-envelope
kind of lawyer.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.352
I'm a push-the-envelope kind of cop.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.477
Which Aceveda sanctioned.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.879
This really does go to the top.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.038
Those are some pretty
high-powered cages to rattle.

34:11.239 --> 34:12.958
So you'll represent us?

34:14.199 --> 34:15.871
Just you.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.399
No.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.596
We're a team.
The four of us come as a package.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.353
I've seen these things go down.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.955
Everyone eventually needs
to look out for themselves.

34:25.159 --> 34:26.478
You don't understand.

34:26.719 --> 34:29.313
We're not the typical lowlifes
that you represent.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.112
We're a family.

34:31.360 --> 34:35.034
We're surviving this together
or we go down together.

34:40.199 --> 34:45.320
Hey. Hey! Shit.
I need some officers in here, quick!

34:48.800 --> 34:50.791
You goddamn terrorist!

34:53.280 --> 34:54.918
Stand back!

35:01.200 --> 35:03.077
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

35:03.320 --> 35:04.958
You took your gun into the cage.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.196
Someone could have
grabbed your weapon!

35:07.720 --> 35:09.756
Do you see all these
people around you, huh?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.353
Look at me.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.515
You trying to kill one of them?
Or you trying to kill one of us?

35:16.040 --> 35:18.270
Hopefully one of you.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.828
Where you going,
pretty thing, huh?

35:40.400 --> 35:42.470
You know why you're dangerous?

35:43.480 --> 35:46.153
Because this isn't real for you yet.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.278
So you're gonna get on me too?

35:49.480 --> 35:53.712
If you wanna be a cop,
you gotta recognise your mistakes.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.916
Learn from them.

35:56.680 --> 36:00.514
All I've done is try to be nice to you.
To everyone.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.359
You got a problem with me,
it's because of your own shit.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.994
See, you're used to being
the queen bee around here.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.033
But you don't get much attention now
with those stretch marks.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.958
So you're gonna
make my life miserable.

36:11.160 --> 36:15.790
Every cop here has made mistakes.
Including you.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.315
And I bet you anything
all of you got cut more slack than me.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.515
If you go out of this room
with that sniffly nose...

36:23.720 --> 36:28.111
...and those red eyes, those guys
will never, ever respect you.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.709
So you pull your shit together.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.993
Jesus, it's bitches like you that
make the job hard for the rest of us.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.875
Hey, man, where is she?

36:44.080 --> 36:46.355
She hasn't come out yet.

36:46.560 --> 36:49.870
She should have been out
10 minutes ago. You saw her go in?

36:50.160 --> 36:51.991
Yeah, man,
unless she went out the back.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.677
Okay, here we go.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.353
Get in.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.516
She getting an IAD escort?

37:10.720 --> 37:13.473
Hang loose.
They might be watching.

37:33.840 --> 37:37.879
- You're not going on vacation, are you?
- Haven't decided where yet.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.116
No.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.992
You're sick.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.835
How sick?

37:46.400 --> 37:50.188
Dutch, I was here yesterday.
I'm here today. I'll be here tomorrow.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.990
I don't know what that means.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.957
I'm your partner.

38:00.200 --> 38:04.159
Look, all that stuff I said about you
not being committed, checked out...

38:05.200 --> 38:06.713
- I'm...
- Dutch.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.797
It's okay.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.275
I gotta go take these pills.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.040
Anybody shows up, you call me.

39:27.520 --> 39:31.433
- Vic. What the hell?
- You didn't return any of my calls.

39:31.640 --> 39:33.471
I got worried.

39:33.680 --> 39:36.114
This dealer was giving me
a hard time.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.437
- I had to get away.
- Sebastio asleep?

39:39.640 --> 39:42.279
Those sessions take it out of him.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.555
What's up with you?

39:57.440 --> 39:59.158
- When did IAD approach you?
- What?

39:59.360 --> 40:00.315
Kavanaugh.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.796
- What's he trying to get you to say?
- No, I don't know a Kavanaugh.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.552
Why you lying to me?

40:09.360 --> 40:11.351
I'm sorry, Vic.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.796
What happened?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.479
Did he come to you...

40:17.680 --> 40:20.353
...threaten to put you in jail
if you didn't cooperate?

40:20.560 --> 40:24.269
Because there's a way out of this,
you know.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.075
What'd you tell him?

40:35.520 --> 40:39.354
That I saw your guy take the heroin.
That's it.

40:41.280 --> 40:44.113
All right. It's okay.

40:44.320 --> 40:47.471
Soon as we get you out of town,
your statement won't mean anything.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.113
No, I can't leave.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.515
Kavanaugh's squeezing you.
I can make it go away.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.109
- I'm gonna pack your shit.
- But Sebastio.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.710
I'm gonna take him to your mother's.
I'll make sure he gets back with you.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.148
Vic.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.229
I didn't know you then.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.993
What?

41:10.600 --> 41:13.273
You've been behind this all along?

41:15.520 --> 41:17.670
You tipped IAD about the heroin.

41:17.880 --> 41:20.075
If had to do it over again,
I'd have said no.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.238
You've been good to me
and Sebastio.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.314
You didn't...?
You didn't say anything?

41:26.520 --> 41:28.397
You never warned me?

41:28.600 --> 41:31.160
- All this goddamned time?
- I told him that...

41:31.360 --> 41:32.679
Shut up.

41:45.560 --> 41:48.472
He checks in on me, Vic.
He'll be here.

41:49.760 --> 41:53.116
- What else did you tell him?
- Nothing. I swear.

41:53.320 --> 41:55.709
Six months.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.718
Six months
you could have warned me!

41:58.920 --> 42:00.319
God...

42:00.520 --> 42:04.752
One of my men, maybe all of us,
are going to jail because of you.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.474
- I was scared.
- I helped your son!

42:07.680 --> 42:09.557
I tried to get you out of this life!

42:20.760 --> 42:23.558
- I'll leave tonight.
- And go where?

42:24.120 --> 42:27.715
- To a phone booth to call Kavanaugh?
- No.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.912
Without you,
IAD's case goes away.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.468
You knew what I was
when you started running with me.

42:37.680 --> 42:41.514
I report on people for money, Vic.
That's what I do!

43:12.600 --> 43:16.036
I found you once. I can do it again.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.552
Come here.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.708
- Who'd you call today?
- What?

43:25.920 --> 43:27.592
On your cell phone,
who did you call?

43:28.640 --> 43:30.312
Only my cousin a few hours ago.

43:30.520 --> 43:33.990
You called her to get a message to her,
to tell me how to find you.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.474
Got it?

43:38.920 --> 43:41.036
Jesus, it's you.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.314
Detective Mackey.

43:49.240 --> 43:50.798
What are you doing here?

43:53.200 --> 43:55.714
It's my CI.
What the hell are you doing here?

44:00.040 --> 44:04.318
Emolia's helping us
with a Salvadoran drug ring.

44:06.520 --> 44:11.514
IAD. Vice.
You're a jack of all trades.

44:12.840 --> 44:16.469
I'm sorry. Did I miss something?
Why is it that you're here?

44:18.240 --> 44:20.231
I got spooked.

44:21.280 --> 44:25.353
Called my cousin.
She called Vic for me.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.230
Next time you hide one of my Cls...

44:30.240 --> 44:31.514
...put a car out front.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.751
This isn't safe.
