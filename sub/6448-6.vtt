00:10.383 --> 00:14.470
Good morning, Metropolis.
I'm your host, Lois Lane.

00:16.222 --> 00:19.057
And I'm your co-host, Clark Kent.

00:19.225 --> 00:22.602
And we're here to help make
the start of your day...

00:28.523 --> 00:31.525
...just a little bit brighter. Right, Clark?

00:31.693 --> 00:33.319
Right. A little less brighter.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.447
Could we start over?

00:37.615 --> 00:39.616
No problem,
let me know when you're ready.

00:39.784 --> 00:41.368
Great.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.703
I appreciate you helping me audition.
I'm angry you didn't tell me...

00:45.871 --> 00:48.122
...how badly Oliver was doing,
but you're here.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.959
So don't make me wish you weren't.

00:50.126 --> 00:53.545
It's okay. You don't need
to get all worked up like you usually do.

00:54.004 --> 00:57.340
Excuse me, Mr. I'm-Slow-And-Steady
And-Know-What's-Best-For-Everyone.

00:57.507 --> 00:59.174
This happens to be important to me.

00:59.342 --> 01:01.676
With newspapers
on the endangered-species list...

01:01.843 --> 01:03.928
...news television
is my only backup plan.

01:04.096 --> 01:07.640
Don't you think you can be a little
less dramatic with this whole thing?

01:07.973 --> 01:10.557
You could be more passionate
with this whole thing.

01:10.726 --> 01:12.852
But not you,
not mild-mannered Clark Kent.

01:13.019 --> 01:16.522
- Do you even care if I get this job?
- Of course. I bought a new tie.

01:16.691 --> 01:19.776
- Oh, well, I bought a whole new outfit.
- Yeah, you look great.

01:20.234 --> 01:21.859
- Don't do that.
Do what?

01:22.027 --> 01:23.820
Don't you dare reassure me right now.

01:24.863 --> 01:28.658
Lois, I'm only doing this for you.

01:30.702 --> 01:32.828
How else am I gonna get
that second date?

01:34.830 --> 01:38.331
You should have thought about that
before you stood me up the first time.

01:39.625 --> 01:41.334
Work lights, please.

01:42.420 --> 01:44.587
Thanks guys, that'll do.

01:44.754 --> 01:46.880
Oh, I'm sorry, we weren't...

01:47.424 --> 01:49.425
Really, one more time would be great.

01:49.592 --> 01:50.968
That's it for today.

01:54.471 --> 01:58.349
What do you say you come back
early Monday and give it another whirl?

02:01.395 --> 02:04.480
- You got the job. Congratulations.
- Great.

02:05.816 --> 02:07.608
I guess this means you forgive me?

02:07.775 --> 02:11.360
Well, let's just say I won't forget
about you when I go national.

02:11.986 --> 02:14.237
Actually, we want you both.

02:15.364 --> 02:16.489
I'm sorry?

02:18.700 --> 02:21.410
Oh, no, he's just here to help me.

02:21.577 --> 02:23.453
I am a behind-the-scenes kind of guy.

02:23.620 --> 02:26.581
That's good. That's real.
That's what people want nowadays.

02:26.749 --> 02:32.670
Besides, you two have great chemistry.
Like Hepburn and Tracy, Regis and Kelly.

02:32.837 --> 02:36.757
It's a package deal, guys.
Either you both stay or you both go.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.025
Hey.

03:47.609 --> 03:51.654
From the look on your face, I'm guessing
Good Morning, Metropolis wasn't good.

03:51.822 --> 03:55.281
- Did Lois get the job?
- Yeah. So did I.

03:55.449 --> 03:58.159
They'd only hire us as a team.

03:58.326 --> 04:00.202
How do I get myself into these things?

04:00.829 --> 04:04.206
- So, what's your first story?
- Online dating.

04:04.374 --> 04:07.709
They want us to tape ourselves
on dates set up through the Internet...

04:07.877 --> 04:10.504
- ...then coffee-talk about them on the show.
- Wow.

04:10.671 --> 04:13.714
Tackling morning television
to get back into Lois' good graces.

04:13.881 --> 04:16.174
This has gotta be
one of your bravest moves yet.

04:16.342 --> 04:18.969
As much as I care about Lois,
there's nothing more important...

04:19.137 --> 04:21.596
- ...than finding the Kandorians.
- Clark.

04:21.763 --> 04:23.722
You've been galloping
around the globe...

04:23.889 --> 04:26.682
...tracking down every
Kryptonian crop circle we've found.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.852
And every time, the Kandorian
who came with it was long gone.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.771
Doesn't mean I'm gonna stop looking.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.149
I think it's time
to start looking a little closer to home.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.276
Tess has been reinforcing her firewalls.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.570
She cut the feed
to her security cameras.

04:40.112 --> 04:42.238
Given her attraction to all things alien...

04:42.406 --> 04:44.615
You think she's building
her own Area 51.

04:44.783 --> 04:46.993
Let me use Watchtower
to peek at her files.

04:47.869 --> 04:51.496
- I'll see what I can find on my end.
- Clark, you've done everything you can.

04:51.663 --> 04:54.874
You chose to come back to your
Daily Planet double life as a cover.

04:55.042 --> 04:57.502
That's what you need to focus on.

04:57.670 --> 05:01.589
Just for today,
leave the Kandorians to me.

05:17.059 --> 05:19.561
What are these?
- Release forms from KZXP.

05:19.730 --> 05:22.398
They want us to fill them out
before we go on our dates.

05:22.566 --> 05:26.194
I have to get a date.
I'm still filling out my online profile.

05:26.402 --> 05:28.612
If you want matchmakers
to pick a winner...

05:28.778 --> 05:32.406
...you really have to be careful
to choose just the right words.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.407
I filled mine out in 10 minutes
this morning.

05:36.409 --> 05:39.036
I guarantee that's the only 10
you're getting out of it.

05:39.828 --> 05:42.038
Well, let's see what you wrote.

05:43.499 --> 05:47.793
All right.
Under "likes" you have the theater.

05:49.338 --> 05:51.339
You mean movie theater.

05:52.340 --> 05:53.423
Details.

05:53.592 --> 05:56.719
Favorite drinks, you have bubbly.
Yeah, if it comes in a six-pack.

05:59.971 --> 06:01.263
I do like a six-pack.

06:01.431 --> 06:04.850
There's nothing about monster trucks.
You love monster-truck rallies.

06:05.017 --> 06:06.809
This is morning television, Clark.

06:06.978 --> 06:09.437
Monster trucks
are not gonna guarantee me a guy...

06:09.605 --> 06:11.689
...who will impress the home viewers.

06:12.190 --> 06:15.817
There are a lot of things about you
that would attract a lot of great guys.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.944
Really? Like what?

06:19.947 --> 06:21.113
Uh....

06:25.535 --> 06:27.452
You're Lois.

06:29.496 --> 06:32.873
Thanks, Clark,
but I already filled out my name.

06:33.042 --> 06:36.461
Good luck on your date.
I'm sure you'll sweep her off her feet.

06:49.596 --> 06:51.472
In the face!

06:57.563 --> 06:59.313
Hit him, baby.

07:06.069 --> 07:07.611
Come on.
Hey. Hey.

07:23.751 --> 07:24.918
That's right.

07:29.548 --> 07:30.881
Yeah, all right.

07:32.133 --> 07:35.385
Why you gotta keep making me
hunt you down, Mia?

07:35.553 --> 07:38.847
How are you supposed to pay me back
if you keep running away?

07:39.389 --> 07:40.806
- Rick.
Yeah, come on.

07:41.015 --> 07:43.641
We wouldn't want anything to happen
to that pretty face.

07:43.809 --> 07:46.269
That's your money-maker, baby.

08:01.198 --> 08:02.365
Nice wheels.

08:03.117 --> 08:04.659
Nice leather.

08:09.372 --> 08:13.292
Still, nothing compares
to Aston Martin's original V8 Vantage.

08:14.378 --> 08:15.712
You know your cars.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.299
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

08:21.467 --> 08:25.053
Take it easy, Speedy. I'm trying
to stay away from life in the fast lane.

08:25.428 --> 08:27.720
So why you cruising for company?

08:27.888 --> 08:31.057
I'm not cruising for company, actually.
I was looking for you.

08:33.477 --> 08:34.644
I've seen you fight.

08:34.811 --> 08:38.814
You got speed, strength.
You're talented.

08:39.815 --> 08:41.191
Why do you care?

08:41.359 --> 08:44.319
I'm just somebody
trying to help you fix your life.

08:44.819 --> 08:46.737
That last guy was twice your size.

08:47.572 --> 08:50.491
He kept on beating you down,
you kept coming back after him.

08:51.826 --> 08:53.661
I don't bruise that easily.

08:53.827 --> 08:55.870
Well, maybe not on the outside.

08:56.913 --> 09:00.748
I know what I'm talking about, Mia,
I used to fight for the same reason.

09:01.918 --> 09:04.294
It never mattered
who was standing across from me.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.629
The real battle was with myself.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.507
I can train you.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.425
I can teach you
how to overcome your fear...

09:12.718 --> 09:16.763
...all that hate in your heart,
and get you off the streets.

09:16.930 --> 09:21.308
Oh, my hero.

09:27.732 --> 09:31.777
So, what's this help gonna cost me,
hero?

09:31.943 --> 09:33.485
Just a little time.

09:33.653 --> 09:36.404
Time enough for me to prove to you
that you can trust me.

09:47.914 --> 09:50.541
Look, I can handle any hacker, okay?

09:50.710 --> 09:54.170
But you should know, someone's
trying to get through to us right now...

09:54.337 --> 09:58.340
-...and I think they're pretty good, so...
- Then be better.

09:59.258 --> 10:03.344
Fix the situation, Stuart.
Or I'll have you terminated.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.974
Okay, by "terminated" though,
you mean fired, right?

10:10.141 --> 10:11.725
Right?

10:19.942 --> 10:21.818
Thank you all for coming today.

10:21.986 --> 10:24.237
For years,
I've tried to steer LuthorCorp...

10:24.446 --> 10:27.156
...towards more
environmentally-conscious projects.

10:27.323 --> 10:29.658
I just had to prove that going green...

10:29.826 --> 10:32.995
...also meant going up
on the stock exchange.

10:33.411 --> 10:35.912
Thanks to cutting-edge technology
we've acquired...

10:36.080 --> 10:39.583
...through our new partnership
with RAO Incorporated...

10:39.752 --> 10:43.378
...I believe this project
will put LuthorCorp on top...

10:43.545 --> 10:48.174
...Metropolis on the map
and our planet back on course.

11:01.727 --> 11:06.564
I give you the world's first
completely self-sustaining solar tower.

11:07.274 --> 11:13.946
This one tower will generate enough
clean energy to power all of Metropolis.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.786
Bravo, Tess.

11:22.952 --> 11:26.538
Congratulations on
an exceptionally well-realized effort.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.754
Mr. Zod.

11:33.213 --> 11:35.005
I never expected to see you here.

11:35.214 --> 11:37.131
Oh, interesting.

11:37.299 --> 11:41.052
Seeing as I am now chairman
and CEO of RAO.

11:44.305 --> 11:45.972
Please, please. Hold your applause.

11:46.139 --> 11:52.101
Save it for the real hero,
our stunning hostess, Tess Mercer.

11:53.021 --> 11:57.817
And by taking on this project,
she is making my simple dream...

11:57.983 --> 12:02.070
...of harnessing the powers of the sun
a reality.

12:02.821 --> 12:05.322
So here's to Tess Mercer...

12:09.076 --> 12:10.868
Hear, hear.

12:13.037 --> 12:17.541
I swear to you all,
this tower will change the world.

12:32.388 --> 12:34.806
Okay, Clark, sound check time.

12:44.106 --> 12:45.273
Say, "One, two, three."

12:46.066 --> 12:47.275
One, two, three?

12:48.276 --> 12:50.068
Put it in your ear first, big guy.

12:52.655 --> 12:54.072
Tap it once to turn it on.

12:56.116 --> 12:58.784
One, two, three.

13:00.618 --> 13:01.827
Thanks.

13:03.288 --> 13:06.164
Wow, Smallville, talk about green.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.085
Like your first day at the Daily Planet
all over again.

13:09.253 --> 13:12.255
This mean I'm about to hear
Lois Lane's rules of online dating?

13:12.421 --> 13:15.840
There really is only one rule
when it comes to dating, Clark...

13:16.049 --> 13:19.760
...show up. Like after you ask someone
to a monster-truck rally...

13:19.928 --> 13:22.054
...it's a good idea
to show up to the date.

13:23.556 --> 13:26.808
Maybe we should talk about this
when we're not being taped.

13:30.438 --> 13:34.315
Okay, Clark,
let's talk about something else.

13:34.691 --> 13:38.861
- Like your online dating profile.
- But that was supposed to be private.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.821
Well, I'll give you this,
you definitely were honest.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.655
Admitting you grew up on a farm...

13:44.824 --> 13:47.618
...is either going to get you
a date with country mouse...

13:47.784 --> 13:50.369
...or a cougar
looking for her next meal.

13:52.663 --> 13:56.333
Hi, Clark. Uh, I'm Catherine.

13:58.503 --> 13:59.629
Or not.

14:01.630 --> 14:03.839
- Hello, Catherine.
- Hi.

14:04.007 --> 14:06.967
- Uh, have a seat.
Okay.

14:08.719 --> 14:09.928
Uh....

14:10.094 --> 14:13.096
I've seen these blind-date shows
on television before...

14:13.264 --> 14:16.892
...but I never actually thought
I would go on one.

14:17.059 --> 14:18.434
This isn't live, is it?

14:18.978 --> 14:21.897
Uh, they're taping it
to air it some other time.

14:22.105 --> 14:25.858
If you can't take the heat, sister,
get out of the café.

14:26.108 --> 14:30.028
Sorry, I have this really annoying
ringing in my ear.

14:30.196 --> 14:32.030
Oh, I understand.

14:32.197 --> 14:36.033
I'm nervous too. I can barely hear
anything over my own heartbeat.

14:36.368 --> 14:38.035
Oh, please.

14:38.661 --> 14:40.703
Just try to treat this
like any other date.

14:40.871 --> 14:45.749
That's the problem, I'm kind of busy
so I don't go on dates much.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.669
What is it that keeps you so busy?

14:48.711 --> 14:50.879
Well, until recently, I was overseas.

14:51.046 --> 14:53.881
Skiing in Switzerland,
modeling in Milan.

14:54.049 --> 14:55.883
Where I was working
in the Peace Corps.

14:56.051 --> 14:59.428
But then I decided to come to Metropolis
to take my Ph.D.

14:59.638 --> 15:03.557
I couldn't decide between sociology
or social justice.

15:03.932 --> 15:05.516
So I'm doing both.

15:05.934 --> 15:07.267
Is she for real?

15:07.769 --> 15:09.019
Congratulations, Clark...

15:09.187 --> 15:12.898
...you're dating Mother Teresa
in 6-inch heels.

15:15.192 --> 15:17.150
Great.

15:27.411 --> 15:29.203
You're welcome.

15:29.371 --> 15:30.955
I didn't thank you.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.414
Well, you should.

15:33.083 --> 15:37.962
Because while your teams were out
scouring the globe, failing to find us...

15:38.170 --> 15:41.715
...I was using our considerably evolved
intelligence to make LuthorCorp...

15:41.881 --> 15:45.259
...the most technologically-advanced
company on Earth.

15:45.427 --> 15:48.721
The question is,
what do you want in return?

15:49.722 --> 15:52.098
Someone who betrayed us.

15:53.599 --> 15:55.767
The one you call the Blur.

15:59.939 --> 16:02.607
I'm flattered you think
of the people on this planet...

16:02.774 --> 16:05.484
...that I'd know how to find the Blur,
but...

16:05.693 --> 16:08.403
Hmm....
You disappoint me, Tess.

16:11.282 --> 16:13.616
But I'll play your game.

16:14.909 --> 16:16.952
The Blur's blood
was used as an antidote...

16:17.119 --> 16:19.579
...to a virus that swept through
Metropolis weeks ago.

16:19.747 --> 16:21.914
We were able to get a sample
of that blood.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.208
We took it to the lab to be tested.

16:26.503 --> 16:30.757
Instead,
every last drop had been destroyed.

16:34.009 --> 16:35.301
At your request.

16:35.802 --> 16:37.219
What are you talking about?

16:37.386 --> 16:40.430
Since you chose
to destroy the Blur's blood samples...

16:40.598 --> 16:43.099
...I'm guessing
you're trying to protect him.

16:43.475 --> 16:46.226
Maybe for some altruistic reasons...

16:46.395 --> 16:49.147
...or maybe you wanted to use him
as a bargaining chip.

16:54.359 --> 16:56.611
I helped free your people
from that orb...

16:56.779 --> 17:00.113
...because I'd hoped
you'd save humanity from itself.

17:01.282 --> 17:06.453
But the only way I can make sure
that happens is if we're equal partners.

17:10.999 --> 17:16.045
No human will ever stand
on equal footing with a Kandorian.

17:35.018 --> 17:38.020
Make her tell you where this Blur is...

17:38.481 --> 17:40.357
...or kill her.

17:40.816 --> 17:42.900
Yes, major.

17:59.832 --> 18:02.416
- Ollie, I need your help.
- Not a good time, Lois.

18:02.585 --> 18:07.213
You know how Clark and I have this side
job hosting Good Morning, Metropolis?

18:07.379 --> 18:10.506
Uh, Clark Kent's hosting
morning television?

18:11.049 --> 18:13.884
I can't wait to watch him
show me how to bake a cake.

18:14.719 --> 18:19.014
Well, our first report does has some heat
but it's not about baking.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.057
They've set us both up on blind dates.

18:22.725 --> 18:24.893
Clark's on a blind date?

18:25.062 --> 18:26.855
Talk about footage of a train wreck.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.901
Well, you might wanna save the space
on your DVR, because here's the kicker.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.402
He did great.

18:36.405 --> 18:38.197
You wanna be better.

18:38.365 --> 18:40.699
That's why I'm here.

18:40.950 --> 18:44.244
- I need you to tell me my red flags.
- Red flags?

18:44.410 --> 18:47.245
Anything about me that annoyed you
while we were together.

18:47.413 --> 18:49.747
I bought a dress,
reserved the Ace of Clubs...

18:49.916 --> 18:52.084
...but if I don't identify
my deal-breakers...

18:52.252 --> 18:54.587
...they're gonna cancel
before it gets to air.

18:54.753 --> 18:57.338
Call it selective memory,
or a short attention span...

18:57.505 --> 18:59.590
...but I only remember
the good things.

18:59.757 --> 19:03.719
Like how you used to brush your hair
back when you were nervous...

19:03.887 --> 19:06.388
...or used to call out football plays
in your sleep.

19:11.142 --> 19:13.393
Thanks for the workout, Ollie,
but time's up.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.855
Do you think you could pay me
in smaller bills?

19:17.022 --> 19:19.273
Nice towel, honey.

19:20.483 --> 19:22.276
Where will she put the money?

19:22.443 --> 19:24.068
Um....

19:24.612 --> 19:26.654
See the thing is,
we were just sparring.

19:26.864 --> 19:29.657
Don't worry, I'm not here to judge.
I just kind of hoped...

19:29.866 --> 19:33.410
...you'd spend more than one week clean
before you got back in the gutter.

19:33.577 --> 19:36.996
- Uh...
- Sorry I interrupted your sparring.

19:39.918 --> 19:43.420
It's... Lois.

19:56.388 --> 19:57.472
Finally.

20:00.516 --> 20:02.643
Another firewall?

20:06.857 --> 20:11.110
That's right, my hapless hacker,
you have been served.

20:13.237 --> 20:17.657
What? Already? Damn, you are fast.

20:17.824 --> 20:20.993
Okay,
I see your anonymous proxy filter...

20:21.160 --> 20:23.327
...with your reinforced
protocol encryption...

20:23.494 --> 20:27.664
...and I raise you one rewritten ACL.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.708
Denied.

20:32.504 --> 20:36.674
Okay. Now you've made me angry.

20:51.018 --> 20:54.187
- You said no strings attached.
- I'm not trying to sleep with you.

20:54.356 --> 20:56.857
But if you think a pebble in your shoe
is painful...

20:57.025 --> 20:59.526
...wait till you feel
what a $50,000 watch will do.

21:05.364 --> 21:08.366
Thank you.
Why don't you look around?

21:08.534 --> 21:10.535
Why would you wanna
go back on the streets?

21:10.702 --> 21:12.244
You don't get it.

21:12.411 --> 21:17.164
If I can finish paying off
what I owe Rick, I'm done. I'm free.

21:18.543 --> 21:21.420
Well, how much do you owe Rick?
I'll cover it.

21:21.587 --> 21:24.756
And then I'd owe you.
I don't think so.

21:24.922 --> 21:27.882
- I'm not that kind of guy...
- Don't tell me about types, okay?

21:28.051 --> 21:32.220
I know them all. Rick's type, your type,
political types, twisted types.

21:32.386 --> 21:33.720
And I'm sick of all of you.

21:36.098 --> 21:37.974
Well, I'm not gonna
trap you here, Mia.

21:38.391 --> 21:42.978
I would just like to see you do something
with your life that you can be proud of.

21:48.734 --> 21:50.693
Why would you help someone like me?

21:52.279 --> 21:55.114
Because I know what it feels like
to be stuck in a place...

21:55.282 --> 21:57.450
...that you feel
there's no escape from.

22:00.952 --> 22:03.078
And my friends...

22:04.414 --> 22:06.080
...helped me find the way out.

22:09.293 --> 22:11.336
If I stay...

22:12.421 --> 22:13.838
...it's gonna cost you.

22:14.005 --> 22:15.505
Way ahead of you.

22:15.715 --> 22:18.258
I went ahead and had my staff
buy you some clothes.

22:21.304 --> 22:23.638
I'm sure you'll find
something in there you like.

22:27.267 --> 22:30.269
Oh, and hey,
hope you dress as fast as you drive...

22:30.436 --> 22:33.104
...because I'm gonna need you
to drop me off somewhere.

22:47.326 --> 22:50.119
- You got anything stronger?
- Of course.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.246
The last thing you need is a drink, Lois.

22:55.123 --> 22:58.292
Thanks, Clark. You sound like
my mother on prom night.

23:02.463 --> 23:04.005
How do I look?

23:05.466 --> 23:07.675
If this were a prom,
you'd be crowned queen.

23:10.304 --> 23:12.138
Your date's a lucky man.

23:14.640 --> 23:18.976
Do I detect a note of jealousy
from the notoriously nice Clark Kent?

23:19.895 --> 23:21.562
Careful my date doesn't hear you.

23:22.147 --> 23:23.648
He might have to take you down.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.359
I'd like to see him try.

23:27.317 --> 23:31.821
You know what they say,
all's fair in love and war.

23:31.988 --> 23:35.491
What's it gonna be for us, Lois,
love or war?

23:36.076 --> 23:39.829
Clark, it sounds like you're asking me out
on another date.

23:43.039 --> 23:45.541
If I was, would you say yes?

23:47.918 --> 23:49.836
I'll tell you what I'd say...

23:53.340 --> 23:55.299
Oliver?

24:01.347 --> 24:02.389
What are you doing?

24:02.556 --> 24:06.434
Well, you wanted this television
tryst to make an impression, right, Lois?

24:06.600 --> 24:10.353
My blind date is with you?

24:10.522 --> 24:14.358
Well, technically your blind date's leaving
in the elevator.

24:14.692 --> 24:17.694
I paid him to go seek
his 15 minutes of fame somewhere else.

24:27.243 --> 24:29.619
You tell Smiley,
he shows up late one more time...

24:29.828 --> 24:32.204
...he's gonna go home in a box.
You understand me?

24:32.373 --> 24:33.623
Yeah, I got it.

24:42.632 --> 24:44.884
I wasn't sure you'd show up, princess.

24:45.759 --> 24:48.553
This should finish paying off
what I owe you.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.889
It belongs to Oliver Queen.

24:51.055 --> 24:54.391
He's probably got 20 of these things.
Guy's richer than the Luthors.

24:54.559 --> 24:57.977
Safe bet says he's got a safe
stuffed with cash someplace.

24:58.937 --> 25:03.107
Which is why I want you to show us
where you dropped him off tonight.

25:04.442 --> 25:08.278
- Rick...
- You honestly think I would let you go?

25:08.737 --> 25:11.405
Mia, honey,
you're my top earner, baby.

25:11.990 --> 25:15.117
So you remember,
you run, I will find you.

25:15.285 --> 25:18.954
You move to another city,
my friends will hunt you down.

25:19.663 --> 25:23.583
No second chances, okay?

25:41.806 --> 25:43.891
Wow, uh....

25:44.100 --> 25:46.268
I always kind of took you
for a beer girl.

25:46.435 --> 25:50.605
No, no, only the finer things in life
for Lois Lane.

25:52.275 --> 25:55.611
Oh, yes. Right. Of course.
Then a toast.

25:57.028 --> 25:58.779
Let's not.

26:08.954 --> 26:13.207
Oliver, it's bad enough that I catch you
dragging yourself through the mud again.

26:13.417 --> 26:15.919
But now you're bound and determined
to ruin my date?

26:18.046 --> 26:19.797
Okay, that meeting you walked in on?

26:19.964 --> 26:22.632
That was someone
I was actually helping.

26:23.968 --> 26:26.636
Well, you obviously helped her
out of her clothes.

26:26.804 --> 26:27.929
Very funny.

26:28.097 --> 26:31.641
I'm not here to sabotage you, I thought
your audience might want a date...

26:31.807 --> 26:35.726
...with Metropolis' most eligible
billionaire bachelor. That'd be me.

26:37.981 --> 26:39.814
I guess it wouldn't hurt the ratings.

26:40.941 --> 26:44.986
Okay, you've got 10 minutes
to explain yourself.

26:45.151 --> 26:46.694
Well, I'm only gonna need one.

26:46.861 --> 26:49.655
Because there's really only one reason
why I came here.

26:52.659 --> 26:55.536
I never finished saying
what it is that I loved about you.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.459
Oh, okay.

27:04.837 --> 27:05.837
Lois, what's going on?

27:06.546 --> 27:08.088
I don't know.

27:08.589 --> 27:10.172
Let me just skip to the end.

27:10.674 --> 27:15.677
The thing I love about you the most
is that you're still in my life.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.348
Because you're still in my heart.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.519
Check, please.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.610
Lois? Lois?

27:34.235 --> 27:36.028
Sorry, Clark.

27:41.366 --> 27:43.868
Couldn't this have waited
until the cameras were off?

27:44.036 --> 27:47.704
No. I'm not hiding my feelings
anymore, Lois.

27:49.206 --> 27:53.710
I figured by saying all that stuff with the
cameras on, I could prove that to you.

27:54.879 --> 28:00.216
I had no idea
you still had such strong feelings.

28:02.259 --> 28:05.637
You know,
I went to a really dark place, Lois.

28:08.931 --> 28:14.019
And I think it took going there
and coming back to realize...

28:16.731 --> 28:18.398
...you're the best part of my life.

28:26.738 --> 28:28.447
I love you, Oliver...

28:31.576 --> 28:33.619
...as a dear friend.

28:36.413 --> 28:39.582
Which is why
I have to be totally honest with you.

28:41.669 --> 28:43.628
Clark.

28:45.963 --> 28:47.756
Yes.

28:56.930 --> 28:58.597
I'm happy you know what you want.

29:02.101 --> 29:04.602
I guess it just hurts
knowing it's not me.

29:06.564 --> 29:08.649
I am so sorry.

29:16.823 --> 29:17.948
Good night, Lois.

29:43.887 --> 29:45.638
Oliver.

29:46.389 --> 29:48.014
Hi.

29:50.642 --> 29:53.310
I said I was your friend and I meant it.

29:53.604 --> 29:56.606
I am not going to let you wander
down any more dark alleys.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.526
Thank you.

30:00.193 --> 30:03.237
But you don't have to worry
about me, Lois.

30:03.820 --> 30:06.905
I'm all about embracing life right now.
I'm not trying to end it.

30:07.115 --> 30:08.532
- Good.
You know what I mean?

30:08.699 --> 30:11.492
Trying to take
the right kind of chances.

30:12.327 --> 30:14.912
You, my friend,
were definitely a chance worth taking.

30:16.497 --> 30:18.248
Thank you.

30:27.049 --> 30:29.885
Is towel girl your driver now?

30:31.678 --> 30:32.845
Maybe your plan B?

30:33.429 --> 30:35.680
Very funny. Uh, her name is Mia.

30:35.848 --> 30:38.682
And, come on, I'll introduce you.
For real this time.

30:43.897 --> 30:45.272
Mia.

30:47.150 --> 30:49.359
Hey, Mia.

30:52.445 --> 30:53.737
I'm sorry.

30:55.740 --> 30:57.365
Oliver.

30:57.533 --> 30:58.533
Ah, ah.

30:58.743 --> 31:00.452
What's your hurry?

31:10.544 --> 31:13.045
Oh, hey. Great work today.

31:14.463 --> 31:16.172
Have you seen the new marketing ad?

31:24.972 --> 31:27.808
I have high hopes for you two.

31:34.023 --> 31:35.982
So did I.

31:41.904 --> 31:44.572
You said you wouldn't hurt him.
Back in the car, Mia.

31:44.740 --> 31:47.574
Tell me you didn't pick
Prince Charming here over Oliver.

31:47.742 --> 31:50.702
Shut up and get in your carriage,
Cinderella.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.958
Get off of me!

32:02.713 --> 32:06.424
Pretty boy's worth billions,
but you're not worth the headache.

32:15.765 --> 32:17.432
I can't let you do this.

32:17.601 --> 32:21.520
Check this out,
streetwalker thinks she's a street fighter.

32:22.188 --> 32:25.065
- What are you gonna do, Mia?
- Stay where you are.

32:25.233 --> 32:27.234
You gonna gun me down?

32:29.318 --> 32:30.694
You don't have it in you.

32:31.821 --> 32:33.697
You're no hero.

32:46.584 --> 32:48.251
Go. Go.

32:59.219 --> 33:02.638
Come on, let's go. Go. Go.

33:05.140 --> 33:06.348
Oliver.

33:07.559 --> 33:08.601
Lois.

33:08.768 --> 33:10.060
Come on.

34:57.445 --> 35:00.072
You will respect me.

35:03.659 --> 35:05.159
Leave me alone.

35:05.577 --> 35:07.495
I'm afraid I can't do that.

35:09.330 --> 35:10.372
Excuse me?

35:18.754 --> 35:22.132
I had to wait until we were locked down
for the night...

35:22.298 --> 35:24.091
...so we won't be interrupted.

35:32.433 --> 35:33.766
You're Kandorian?

35:33.934 --> 35:37.020
And I have a message from Major Zod.

35:37.311 --> 35:39.646
Tell me where the Blur is...

35:40.524 --> 35:42.150
...or you die.

35:52.491 --> 35:55.994
- You find a lead on the Kandorian?
- I've run every play in my playbook...

35:56.161 --> 35:59.830
...to try and access Tess' files but
she's got one hell of a defensive line.

35:59.997 --> 36:03.708
The good news is
I've only counted 100 firewalls...

36:03.918 --> 36:06.253
...so I think
I'm actually about to score.

36:12.967 --> 36:16.470
Greetings,
estimable foe, whoever you are.

36:16.637 --> 36:19.472
Now, I'm guessing,
since you've made it this far...

36:19.638 --> 36:23.516
...you probably haven't slept
and your fingers are getting cramped up.

36:23.683 --> 36:26.852
So I thought I would take it upon myself
to do you a big favor...

36:27.021 --> 36:29.064
...and just say, "Give up."

36:29.273 --> 36:31.483
I can do this all day and all night.

36:31.650 --> 36:35.653
I'm sure you already get the picture.
So talk to the hand.

36:39.073 --> 36:41.157
Hello, hand.

36:53.502 --> 36:57.171
Stuart Campbell, graduate of MIT,
talk to these hands.

36:57.588 --> 36:58.838
Nice work, Chloe.

36:59.005 --> 37:02.007
So it looks like Stuart Campbell
is Tess' tech boy wonder.

37:02.175 --> 37:05.844
And he has done some pretty
heavyweight hacking of his own.

37:06.012 --> 37:08.555
Government databases, corporations.

37:08.723 --> 37:12.559
Wow, we could do a lot
with this kind of leverage.

37:13.351 --> 37:15.352
Maybe even get him to join us.

37:17.523 --> 37:19.232
You'd even match.

37:19.942 --> 37:24.362
Clark, this guy is so good, every time I'd
get close, he'd show up and block me.

37:25.403 --> 37:26.570
I know the feeling.

37:29.532 --> 37:33.034
Lois and Oliver. Seeing him with her,
it's been a long time...

37:33.202 --> 37:35.870
- ...since he looked that happy.
- Clark, just stop, okay?

37:36.036 --> 37:40.373
Your willingness to sacrifice yourself
for others is a great strength for sure.

37:40.542 --> 37:43.544
But when it comes to your own
happiness, it's a weakness.

37:43.710 --> 37:45.920
Oliver's been through a lot,
and we're friends.

37:46.088 --> 37:48.339
Lois is not up for auction.

37:48.506 --> 37:50.882
Look, for once,
try not to second guess things.

37:51.050 --> 37:54.719
All you have to do is ask yourself,
what do you want?

40:53.370 --> 40:55.204
- Lois.
- Did you hear?

40:55.372 --> 40:59.208
The brilliant brass at KZXP have decided
to go with someone else for their show.

40:59.711 --> 41:02.713
- Lois...
- After Ollie and I almost got killed...

41:02.879 --> 41:04.880
...guess who they've decided
to go with.

41:05.089 --> 41:07.549
Apparently blonds test better
with morning viewers.

41:07.717 --> 41:09.384
- Lois.
- I'm sorry.

41:09.552 --> 41:12.637
I never should have tried out,
or dragged you there with me...
