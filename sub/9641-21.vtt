00:06.167 --> 00:08.850
???

00:08.851 --> 00:12.150
Fowerd. ???

00:12.219 --> 00:15.587
Now, let's get
out there and walk."

00:17.890 --> 00:21.792
Justin, are you sure you don't
want to do my graduation speech?

00:21.827 --> 00:24.637
It goes like this...

00:24.671 --> 00:26.519
"Later, losers."

00:27.929 --> 00:30.688
There he is.
Our graduating senior.

00:30.723 --> 00:33.237
We got you some graduation
presents, sweetie.

00:33.272 --> 00:36.918
Thank you, Mom, but shouldn't
you wait to give me this until
after I graduate?

00:36.953 --> 00:39.049
Don't be ridiculous.

00:39.084 --> 00:41.894
You're the only one of our kids
who we know is gonna make it
through high school.

00:41.928 --> 00:43.197
We're excited.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.918
- It's a new briefcase!
- Aww, thank you.

00:49.953 --> 00:53.996
Although, technically,
it's called an attachÃ© case.

00:54.030 --> 00:59.044
We know, honey. We just didn't
want you running around saying,
"AttachÃ©. AttachÃ©."

01:03.121 --> 01:06.126
Well, you know, I got Justin
a graduation present, too.

01:06.160 --> 01:11.275
Yeah, sure you did.
Good one, sweetie.

01:12.747 --> 01:14.650
Um, I think
she's serious, you guys.

01:14.684 --> 01:16.353
Then we gotta
get out of here.

01:16.387 --> 01:20.394
My eyebrows just grew back
from her last gift. Come on.

01:20.429 --> 01:22.567
Can you believe them?

01:22.601 --> 01:25.371
Assuming I'm about to
do something so bad
they had to leave the room?

01:25.406 --> 01:26.974
Harper, sit down.

01:28.945 --> 01:30.915
OK, now this
is a little tricky

01:30.950 --> 01:35.189
because my gift is not something
that technically can be wrapped.

01:35.223 --> 01:38.127
Oh my gosh. It is fire.

01:38.162 --> 01:40.464
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

01:40.499 --> 01:44.304
Wait, come on.
Harper, you guys, hear me out.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.240
- OK, my gift to you...
- Hmm.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.511
...is that, four years ago,
I used magic to create
a duplicate of you

01:50.546 --> 01:54.051
- and I sent him off to college.
- What?

01:54.085 --> 01:56.588
- Yeah, and he's about to graduate.
- What?!

01:56.622 --> 01:59.492
So, basically, I just saved
you from like four more years
of school.

01:59.527 --> 02:00.828
What?!?!

02:00.863 --> 02:04.267
I have to agree with Justin
on this one. What?!

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074

03:01.921 --> 03:03.689
Alex, why would you make
a duplicate of me?

03:03.757 --> 03:06.093
I was actually looking
forward to the next
four years of college.

03:06.127 --> 03:10.596
I was finally gonna try
that notebook paper with
the skinnier lines.

03:10.630 --> 03:14.198
I did this because family
is important to me, Justin.

03:14.233 --> 03:16.900
I'm so sorry for wanting to do
something nice for my brother.

03:16.934 --> 03:19.569
Oh, family
is important to you?

03:19.604 --> 03:22.974
I needed a heartwarming
lead in. I don't...

03:23.008 --> 03:27.212
Harper, would you please tell
Justin that he's overreacting

03:27.246 --> 03:28.880
and this is actually
a good thing?

03:28.915 --> 03:31.417
It is a good thing.
I can use the new Justin

03:31.451 --> 03:34.287
to make Zeke and the old Justin
jealous. Then they can fight...

03:35.355 --> 03:38.058
...over me.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.128
I don't think it's gonna
work. I think the old Justin
heard me.

03:43.532 --> 03:45.934
Look, Justin,
it will be fine, OK?

03:45.969 --> 03:48.838
Once your duplicate comes,
I'll put your brains back
together,

03:48.872 --> 03:51.274
and you can keep all of his
memories plus a college degree

03:51.309 --> 03:53.410
without having
to go away to college.

03:53.444 --> 03:55.312
Everything is going
according to plan.

03:55.347 --> 03:56.981
And how can you be
so sure about that?

03:57.016 --> 04:00.518
Because I kept a scrapbook
of all of your duplicate's
accomplishments

04:00.552 --> 04:02.286
over the past four years.

04:02.321 --> 04:04.923
If you think your high school
experience was impressive,

04:04.957 --> 04:06.558
wait till you see
what you did in college.

04:06.592 --> 04:10.496
OK, you made straight A's
every semester.

04:10.530 --> 04:12.931
Big deal.
I always get straight A's.

04:12.965 --> 04:16.401
You were voted Most
Analytical Brain by
the Intramural Chess Team.

04:17.870 --> 04:20.238
I was? You know
that award is special

04:20.273 --> 04:22.440
because it comes from your
peers, which is...

04:22.474 --> 04:24.841
You know what?
Maybe this isn't bad.

04:24.876 --> 04:26.976
Maybe you're right. Maybe
this is a good thing after all.

04:27.010 --> 04:29.077
I knew that chess thing
would change your mind.

04:29.112 --> 04:31.012
There's actually nothing else
in this scrapbook.

04:32.748 --> 04:35.116
Nope. Nothin'. Nothin'.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.154
Jerry, I've been thinking.

04:38.188 --> 04:40.156
Is it about eating
or ways to save money?

04:40.190 --> 04:42.691
Please say, "Eating!"
Please say, "Eating!"

04:42.725 --> 04:45.860
It's about
being better parents.

04:45.895 --> 04:50.197
Oh, well, that's not
as interesting to me,
but... go ahead.

04:50.232 --> 04:53.667
You know how we never make it
to the kids' school functions

04:53.702 --> 04:55.669
in time to sit
in the auditorium?

04:55.703 --> 04:57.971
And we always end up sitting
in the overflow section,

04:58.005 --> 05:00.940
watching on a video monitor with
the rest of the bad parents?

05:00.974 --> 05:03.108
That school
has an auditorium?

05:04.877 --> 05:08.212
Well, I thought it would
be nice if we really tried

05:08.246 --> 05:11.281
to make it to Justin's
graduation ceremony on time.

05:11.315 --> 05:15.551
That's a great idea, honey.
Because we're better than
those other bad parents.

05:15.586 --> 05:19.120
And getting there on time
is just the way to prove
it to them.

05:19.155 --> 05:20.721
Exactly.

05:20.756 --> 05:23.190
And everyone knows the best
thing about being good parents

05:23.224 --> 05:25.759
is getting to tell as many
people about it as possible.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.897
Hi. We'll walk you out.
We're about to be really
great parents.

05:30.932 --> 05:32.565
Their school
has an auditorium.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.736
I don't know how I'm
supposed to do this, Alex.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.505
I've never met a duplicate
of myself before.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.707
Just relax. It'll be fine.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.576
But what do I say to him?
Do I shake his hand

05:43.610 --> 05:46.780
or do I do that thing
like we're both looking
in the mirror?

05:52.251 --> 05:56.386
He's you, Justin. Just do
what you would want someone
to do to you.

05:56.421 --> 05:58.921
In that case, I'll compliment
him on his ascot.

05:58.956 --> 06:00.322
What's an ascot?

06:00.357 --> 06:02.857
Come on,
it's a silk man scarf

06:02.892 --> 06:05.593
that cartoony millionaires
wear around their necks.

06:05.628 --> 06:08.229
Usually they're on boats.
Which is...

06:15.170 --> 06:19.172
- Is he here yet?
- Harper, what are you wearing?

06:19.206 --> 06:21.673
This is a college man
we're talking about, Alex.

06:21.708 --> 06:24.242
I had to choose something
from my mature collection.

06:24.276 --> 06:26.877
Well, does that dress come
with a horse and buggy?

06:26.911 --> 06:30.946
It's parked out back,
and someone isn't getting
a ride in it.

06:33.648 --> 06:35.649
Oh, my gosh.
Look. Here I come.

06:41.621 --> 06:44.889
Aw, man,
I'm not wearing an ascot.

06:44.923 --> 06:47.724
[sighs] All right.
Let's do this.

06:50.929 --> 06:52.463
He's not doing it.

06:53.831 --> 06:57.199
Oh, I get it.
Tai chi, man.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.303
He is wearing a fancy man scarf,
but on his head.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.737
And it's a bandana.

07:02.771 --> 07:04.638
But why would I wanna
hide my hair?

07:04.673 --> 07:07.474
Oh my gosh. I've stopped
conditioning regularly.

07:08.943 --> 07:10.477
Justin, wait up.

07:10.512 --> 07:12.947
Don't call me Justin.

07:12.981 --> 07:16.750
I only go by my spirit name,
Bursting Eagle.

07:19.319 --> 07:21.385
OK, Exploding Bird,

07:21.420 --> 07:25.088
Uh, I think that there
is someone you should meet.

07:25.123 --> 07:28.925
All right, fine, if that's
why you called me down here.

07:28.959 --> 07:32.895
But I think there's someone
that you should meet:
your inner self.

07:32.929 --> 07:35.563
No thanks. I'm good with
my outer self.

07:35.597 --> 07:37.631
- In the meantime...
- What happened to you?

07:37.666 --> 07:40.934
College. It changed me.

07:40.968 --> 07:43.169
I took an Introductory
Philosophy course

07:43.203 --> 07:46.472
and I realized that there
are much more important
things in life

07:46.506 --> 07:48.606
than being a know-it-all.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.908
[scoffs] Name one!

07:50.942 --> 07:54.644
Uh, the stark beauty
of silence, man.

07:54.679 --> 07:56.813
What are you
talking about...?

07:56.847 --> 07:59.716
Shhh.

07:59.751 --> 08:01.551
There it is.

08:01.586 --> 08:05.754
It's beautiful.
It kind of breaks my heart too.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.624
I... I...

08:08.658 --> 08:10.926
Look, I don't know why
you are acting like this.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.095
OK, you were given awards
from the chess team.

08:13.129 --> 08:17.999
No, no, no. Society does not
determine my value. This does.

08:18.034 --> 08:20.968
A dirty, leather necklace?

08:21.003 --> 08:24.271
No. I was pointing
to my heart.

08:24.306 --> 08:26.507
I determine
what's important to me.

08:26.541 --> 08:28.909
No, no, no. I determine
what's important to you.

08:28.944 --> 08:32.745
You're supposed to be at
college, having the experiences
that I've always dreamed about.

08:32.780 --> 08:37.015
Well maybe it's time you started
dreaming with this, man.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.549
My heart?

08:38.582 --> 08:41.953
No, I'm talking about this
dirty leather dreamcatcher.

08:41.986 --> 08:44.188
Alex, I need to speak to you
real quick for one minute!

08:44.222 --> 08:48.692
Hey, where are you guys going?
Secrets are for people
who have something to hide.

08:48.726 --> 08:51.661
Look what you've done!
I am a total mess.

08:51.695 --> 08:54.730
This guy is a total mess.
I am a total mess.

08:54.764 --> 08:56.831
Relax, man.

08:56.866 --> 08:58.733
Oh, don't you start now.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.301
Don't worry.

09:00.335 --> 09:03.437
Look, we'll recombine the two
of you. That'll get rid of him.

09:03.472 --> 09:05.972
But you'll get to keep all
of his knowledge and memories.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.542
All right!
Just get him into the Lair!

09:13.379 --> 09:17.248
Alex, part of your gift was
recombining us and you didn't
even look that up?

09:17.282 --> 09:20.652
Well, four years ago
I thought I would have learned
a lot more by now.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.721
So excuse me
for shooting too high.

09:25.323 --> 09:26.890
Wait a minute.
Here's something.

09:26.924 --> 09:28.224
What is it?

09:28.258 --> 09:30.292
It's a spell to duplicate money.

09:30.326 --> 09:31.726
Why has that not been
a wizard lesson?

09:31.760 --> 09:33.894
- Alex!
- Sorry.

09:33.929 --> 09:35.496
Why isn't he helping?

09:35.530 --> 09:38.331
Helping people's
a weakness, man.

09:38.366 --> 09:41.367
It means you're trying
to fill a void in your own life.

09:41.401 --> 09:45.970
Or you're like
just too tired or something.

09:48.140 --> 09:51.276
You know, I was rethinking you,
but now I'm gonna go back
to what I originally thought.

09:51.310 --> 09:52.844
You're a dirty creep.

09:52.878 --> 09:56.981
And your honesty
is like a ray of sunshine.

09:57.015 --> 09:59.750
- Awww.
- Ohhh.

09:59.784 --> 10:02.419
Wait! Here it is! OK.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.055
OK.

10:06.090 --> 10:09.590
Two of him aren't twice as fun.
Turn these Justins back to one.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.959
[zapping]

10:13.695 --> 10:16.963
Huh. Look at that.
It worked.

10:16.997 --> 10:19.065
And to think, this is
usually around the time

10:19.099 --> 10:21.267
when things take an unexpected
turn for the worse.

10:21.301 --> 10:23.202
It's nice to have
you back, Justin.

10:23.236 --> 10:27.572
- Yeah?
What's so great about it?
- Excuse me?

10:27.607 --> 10:33.311
What's so great about anything
in this crazy, mixed-up world
we're living in, man?

10:35.147 --> 10:36.513
Oh, no.

10:45.442 --> 10:47.275
I don't care about
graduating high school,

10:47.310 --> 10:49.710
and I don't care
about aliens or robots,

10:49.744 --> 10:51.611
and [scoffs] I sure
n't care about grades.

10:51.646 --> 10:54.012
[Alex scoffs] I agree.

10:54.047 --> 10:56.581
Grades are just a way of telling
you how you're doing in school.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.382
And I don't think
that's anyone's business.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.050
Exactly. You get it.

11:00.085 --> 11:04.186
Because participating in grades
gives The Man permission to
judge you.

11:04.221 --> 11:06.288
And nobody judges me.

11:06.322 --> 11:09.157
<i>Until the 19th, when I
audition for Oklahoma!.</i>

11:10.726 --> 11:14.095
<i>Why is he acting like this?
He'll never get a part
in Oklahoma!.</i>

11:15.931 --> 11:18.265
I guess when we put him back
together with his duplicate,

11:18.299 --> 11:21.401
he kept his duplicate's
personality and doesn't
really care about anything.

11:21.435 --> 11:25.137
Now, now hold on there. I care
about a lot of things, man.

11:25.172 --> 11:29.274
Like the hot asphalt
of the open road, OK,

11:29.308 --> 11:33.177
suede, all right,
tasseled jackets.

11:33.212 --> 11:35.712
Yeah.
Well, that's about it.

11:35.747 --> 11:40.449
Oh. No, don't forget
the stark beauty of silence.

11:40.483 --> 11:43.084
There. That's it.

11:45.020 --> 11:48.623
OK, if this is what
college guys are like,
I'm dating a military man.

11:48.657 --> 11:51.091
I kind of like
this new Justin.

11:51.126 --> 11:54.993
He's not so uptight
about everything,
and so annoyingly positive.

11:56.896 --> 11:59.097
So you're not gonna
do anything to fix this?

11:59.132 --> 12:01.366
Haven't I done enough?

12:07.574 --> 12:10.609
[Mr. Laritate]
Ah, Justin, there you are.

12:10.643 --> 12:12.877
Just wanted to let
you know how excited I am

12:12.912 --> 12:17.247
to hear exactly what you've
got in store for everyone with
your big graduation speech.

12:17.282 --> 12:20.851
<i>Oh, I'm gonna deliver a speech,
all right, el Jefe...</i>

12:20.885 --> 12:23.919
...that's gonna rock the flimsy
foundation of this school.

12:23.954 --> 12:26.755
Who told you
about our flimsy foundation?

12:26.789 --> 12:29.423
Look, you can either have
our music department or
ructural safety,

12:29.457 --> 12:31.992
but you can't have both!

12:34.128 --> 12:36.962
Alex, there's something wrong
with your brother.

12:36.997 --> 12:41.001
He keeps saying all this crazy
stuff, like he wants to look
for America.

12:41.035 --> 12:44.903
And that love can't exist
without hate. What does
that even mean?

12:44.938 --> 12:48.839
Zeke, maybe you should
give this new Justin a chance.

12:48.873 --> 12:50.473
Who knows,
you might actually like him.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.676
Are you serious?

12:52.711 --> 12:55.313
He's running around,
giving everyone spirit names.

12:55.348 --> 12:58.549
I refuse to be addressed
as Bouncing Chipmunk.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.418
Where would he get
that idea? Where?!
Where would he get that?!

13:01.452 --> 13:03.120
Where?!

13:03.154 --> 13:06.555
And now everyone wants
to hear what he has
to say for his big speech.

13:06.590 --> 13:09.458
Everyone? Don't you think
that's a bit of an exaggeration?

13:09.492 --> 13:11.226
Is it?

13:11.260 --> 13:14.863
Chanting makes it important.

13:14.897 --> 13:17.165
[all] Chanting
makes it important!

13:17.233 --> 13:19.000
Chanting makes it important!

13:19.034 --> 13:20.668
Oh my gosh. He's right.

13:20.702 --> 13:22.903
Chanting does make things
sound important.

13:22.938 --> 13:23.971
[makes rooster-like call]

13:35.147 --> 13:36.814
Hey, Alex, check it out.

13:36.848 --> 13:39.282
I'm helping Zeke come up
with a back-up graduation speech

13:39.317 --> 13:42.252
for when Justin's speech
turns into one of those
annoying chants.

13:42.286 --> 13:44.920
As it turns out,
channg doesn't make
stuff sound important.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.355
It's just a less
lonely way to complain.

13:48.723 --> 13:50.656
That's why we're
writing our own speech.

13:50.690 --> 13:53.491
It's about how sidekicks
and followers are cool.

13:53.525 --> 13:55.526
You guys, I don't know
why you're so upset.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.163
Justin is gonna be fe, OK.
People love everything
he has to say.

14:02.099 --> 14:05.536
All I'm saying, you guys,
is that planning your future

14:05.570 --> 14:09.372
is like digging your grave
with a pencil

14:09.407 --> 14:11.140
and like a calenr.

14:11.174 --> 14:13.042
Uh-oh.

14:14.912 --> 14:17.346
Alex,
what's wrong with him?

14:17.381 --> 14:20.749
What? Nothing.
What? Nothing.

14:22.085 --> 14:23.984
Tell her what you just
told us, Justin.

14:24.019 --> 14:27.821
When cowboys used to get really
really hungry they ate these
things right here.

14:27.855 --> 14:29.855
No, the other thing.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.790
Chanting makes it important.

14:32.759 --> 14:33.859
No, the other thing.

14:33.893 --> 14:36.061
I bought these
jeans pre-ripped.

14:39.764 --> 14:41.965
It's fun, right? I...

14:43.200 --> 14:46.703
Ahhh. Sunshine.

14:49.106 --> 14:50.406
What did you do to him?

14:50.441 --> 14:53.010
OK, I didn't wanna
say anything

14:53.044 --> 14:55.312
but Justin's
not really Justin right now.

14:55.347 --> 14:57.481
Yeah, we figured
that part out.

14:57.516 --> 15:00.618
It's... It's actually
kind of a funny story, really.

15:00.686 --> 15:03.888
You see,
I made a duplicate of Justin,

15:03.922 --> 15:06.523
and I put him through
four years of college.

15:07.558 --> 15:10.192
And then recombined
the two of them

15:10.226 --> 15:14.095
and it ended up drastically
changing Justin's personality

15:14.129 --> 15:16.864
to a point where he's really
not even recognizable anymore.

15:16.898 --> 15:18.932
Why aren't you
laughing with me?

15:20.802 --> 15:22.836
Alex, this is horrible!

15:22.870 --> 15:25.204
You are going to ruin
your brother's graduation.

15:25.239 --> 15:28.007
And more important,
we just committed
to being good parents,

15:28.041 --> 15:32.010
and this is wrecking
that whole plan!

15:32.044 --> 15:34.679
You're gonna fix this,
young lady, so he can
have his graduation,

15:34.714 --> 15:37.248
and we can be there,
in the regular audience,

15:37.282 --> 15:39.150
like the good
parents you've never had!

15:43.021 --> 15:47.257
So you're telling me that
I have to come up with
a solution all by myself

15:47.292 --> 15:50.594
to a problem that
I created all by myself?

15:50.628 --> 15:53.030
Well, that's not fair.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.833
Please, Mr. Laritate,

15:56.868 --> 15:59.235
you gotta let Zeke give
the speech instead of Justin.

15:59.269 --> 16:00.569
He's got it all
figureout.

16:00.604 --> 16:03.705
Even the overflow parents
will love it. Show 'em, Zeke.

16:03.740 --> 16:08.941
[clears throat] Today is
the first day of the rest
of your lives.

16:08.976 --> 16:12.311
The world is your oyster.

16:12.345 --> 16:15.380
Spread your wings and fly!

16:15.415 --> 16:17.949
I have a very unoriginal brain.
It's perfect for this kind
of thing.

16:17.983 --> 16:22.486
If you want to see his head
explode, tell him you're
having breakfast for dinner.

16:22.521 --> 16:25.822
[gasps] You can't have breakfast
for dinner. It's called "three
meals a day!"

16:25.857 --> 16:27.658
You space 'em out
and you have a jog in-between!

16:27.692 --> 16:29.426
Well, what about brunch?

16:29.460 --> 16:32.328
You can't have brunch!
It's a combination! You know
I'm scared of combinations!

16:32.362 --> 16:34.730
Now, listen!
Listen! Listen!

16:34.764 --> 16:38.132
These people are very excited
to hear Justin lead a chant

16:38.167 --> 16:41.335
in how unexciting
everything is.

16:41.370 --> 16:43.937
Try not to think
about that sentence too much.

16:45.106 --> 16:47.540
By the way,
what do you think of my jacket?

16:50.211 --> 16:53.312
The fringe
makes it slimming.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.918
Harper, OK,

16:58.952 --> 17:02.320
I found a spell that will pull
the college education out of
Justin's brain. Where is he?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.422
Last I saw him he was outside
leading some chant

17:04.457 --> 17:06.457
with bus drivers
about exact change.

17:06.492 --> 17:11.127
All right. I'm ready to tell
these people to give up.

17:12.262 --> 17:13.496
Where's the microphone at?

17:13.531 --> 17:15.031
Yep, OK, yes,
I can't wait either.

17:15.065 --> 17:17.300
It'll be really fun.
I just have to do something.

17:19.369 --> 17:22.037
Brain, brain go away,
back before the college days!

17:22.071 --> 17:24.673
[zapping]

17:24.707 --> 17:27.309
[exhales deeply]
Well, how do you feel?

17:27.343 --> 17:31.577
I look silly.
I'm wearing a nightgown.

17:32.779 --> 17:35.347
Yep, that sounds like it
worked. All right, go.

17:36.215 --> 17:37.715
[applause]

17:37.749 --> 17:39.583
<i>[Mr. Laritate]
Thank you, Mr. Guerreri,</i>

17:39.617 --> 17:43.187
<i>for showing us that
a 52-year-old English
teacher can still</i>

17:43.221 --> 17:46.022
kind of dunk a basketball.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.828
And now,
our student body president

17:50.862 --> 17:54.130
will address
his senior class.

17:54.165 --> 17:57.099
Ladies and gentlemen,
Justin Russo.

17:57.133 --> 17:59.100
<i>Anybody gonna call
the nurse for Mr. Guerreri?</i>

17:59.135 --> 18:02.303
<i>He looks really tangled up
in that mini-trampoline.</i>

18:02.337 --> 18:04.671
I want a puppy,
but I can't have one

18:04.706 --> 18:06.941
until I stop
putting gum in my hair.

18:08.777 --> 18:10.344
What is he doing?

18:10.379 --> 18:12.579
I don't know. He's acting
like a kindergartner.

18:12.614 --> 18:15.815
[groans] I must've taken
too much of his brain away.

18:15.850 --> 18:17.183
I've gotta get him
out of there.

18:17.217 --> 18:19.752
I don't need a stool to reach
the sink. Some people...

18:19.786 --> 18:22.655
Uh, what he means
to say is,

18:22.689 --> 18:28.060
Tribeca Prep is like
the stool of our lives.

18:28.094 --> 18:31.797
And we no longer need
that stool to reach the sink

18:31.831 --> 18:34.265
which is...
which is our future.

18:34.299 --> 18:36.700
So good night, everybody!

18:36.735 --> 18:39.403
<i>[Justin] I'm not supposed
to touch the stove,
'cause it's hot.</i>

18:39.437 --> 18:42.505
Because the stove,
you see, is... is danger.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.041
And there can be so much
danger in our future...

18:45.075 --> 18:47.977
[moans ghoulishly]

18:49.879 --> 18:53.881
...that we will
have to overcome

18:53.915 --> 18:57.049
<i>with courage.
So good night, everybody!</i>

18:57.084 --> 19:00.819
My bedtime is seven, but
I can read pop-up books
in bed until eight.

19:00.853 --> 19:05.090
Take care of your health,
and something about reading.
Good night, everybody.

19:06.793 --> 19:10.395
<i>[Mr. Laritate]
Thank you, Justin. And Alex.</i>

19:10.430 --> 19:12.631
I had hoped for something
a bit more thought-provoking,

19:12.665 --> 19:17.101
but it was time to get Mr.
Guerreri into the ambulance,
so, you know...

19:18.103 --> 19:19.637
<i>[Mr Laritate clears throat]</i>

19:19.671 --> 19:23.273
<i>And now I would like to award
the diplomas in class order.</i>

19:24.742 --> 19:27.444
Valedictorian,
Justin Russo.

19:31.115 --> 19:32.782
[cheers, whistles]

19:34.218 --> 19:35.684
[gasps]

19:35.719 --> 19:38.052
I can see our head!
It's huge!

19:40.722 --> 19:43.490
Salutatorian, Zeke Beekerman

19:43.524 --> 19:45.792
[applause]

19:45.826 --> 19:50.462
Brunch is not a meal.
Spread your wings and fly!

19:54.933 --> 19:56.600
- We're late!
- [groans]

19:56.634 --> 20:00.403
I can't believe you made
the cab driver stop
for a hot dog, Jerry.

20:00.437 --> 20:03.072
Well, I wasn't gonna
let him run over it.

20:07.612 --> 20:11.414
I guess we're stuck here again
with the overflow crowd.

20:11.448 --> 20:14.516
Let's face it,
we're overflow parents.

20:14.551 --> 20:17.719
These will always
be our people.

20:17.753 --> 20:20.455
Excuse me.
Those are our seats.

20:22.024 --> 20:26.026
We're the reason
this whole set up exists.

20:26.060 --> 20:28.828
Hey, hey! There he is!

20:28.863 --> 20:30.163
Our high school graduate!

20:30.197 --> 20:32.832
Just so you know, honey,
we got here on time.

20:32.866 --> 20:35.868
We saw the whole thing.
We thought your speech
was great.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.437
Yeah, and that
emotional part was...

20:39.472 --> 20:42.474
that was really emotional,
and I... I...

20:42.508 --> 20:45.309
I don't... [fake whimper]

20:45.344 --> 20:48.679
OK, Dad, there was
no emotional part.
He didn't do the speech.

20:48.713 --> 20:50.047
Why not?

20:50.081 --> 20:51.948
I'm not allowed to
read books on the potty,

20:51.983 --> 20:54.416
because I stay in there
way too long.

20:56.586 --> 20:58.052
[blows raspberry]

20:58.087 --> 21:01.489
That's the sound I make
when I'm on the potty.

21:02.581 --> 21:04.048
- imics plane]
- Hey!

21:05.817 --> 21:07.918
[mimics plane]

21:07.952 --> 21:09.119
Stop it!

21:09.153 --> 21:10.887
- [mimics plane]
- Sit...!

21:10.921 --> 21:12.721
Do you
want this lollipop or not?

21:12.756 --> 21:15.357
[mimics crash] Yes.

21:17.327 --> 21:18.461
Then sit down.

21:18.495 --> 21:20.230
OK.

21:24.569 --> 21:27.804
Retrieve-um cerebrum!

21:27.838 --> 21:29.471
Lollipop?

21:29.506 --> 21:33.404
I only allow myself one
of these on Halloween.
This is not Halloween!

21:33.439 --> 21:38.010
Welcome back.
Justin, I'm so sorry.

21:38.044 --> 21:41.813
I should've never created that
duplicate in the first place.

21:43.848 --> 21:46.448
I guess I was just scared
that I really wouldn't have
anybody

21:46.483 --> 21:48.816
to fight with when
you went off to college.

21:51.652 --> 21:54.687
We've had a lot
of pretty good fights, huh?

21:56.322 --> 21:59.991
I think we've still got
a few good ones left in us.
What do you think?

22:01.294 --> 22:02.928
I hope so.

22:02.962 --> 22:07.265
You guys are hilarious.
Just say you love each other.

22:07.299 --> 22:09.167
[both scoff] No, we don't!

22:12.303 --> 22:14.604
I'm sorry I interfered
with your college plans.

22:14.639 --> 22:17.841
It's all good. When I had
that college brain in my head,

22:17.876 --> 22:19.977
I realized that I knew
all of that stuff anyway.

22:20.011 --> 22:24.081
Now it's time to get on
with the real learning.
Medical school here I come.

22:25.417 --> 22:27.651
How expensive is that?

22:27.685 --> 22:30.520
If I told you,
you'd need a doctor.
