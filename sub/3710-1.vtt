00:39.410 --> 00:41.350
It's no longer the era of industry.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.890
We're in a technological era,
fundamentally.

00:47.170 --> 00:50.190
The fascists, they have the resources.

00:50.290 --> 00:52.510
But we have imagination.

00:52.610 --> 00:56.170
We are making the tools
to take back our sovereignty.

00:57.250 --> 01:01.150
When we make a giant "fuck you" to the
system, it's breaking that stranglehold

01:01.250 --> 01:04.890
on the tools of power
that's used against us.

01:05.890 --> 01:08.010
The fascists always use the narrative of,

01:08.130 --> 01:12.810
"We are the white knights in shining armor
protecting against the threats.

01:12.930 --> 01:17.870
We come here and we move out
the dark with pure whiteness."

01:17.970 --> 01:20.170
That's a false narrative,

01:20.290 --> 01:23.910
because there is corruption
in those castles.

01:24.010 --> 01:27.270
The real base of power lies with us.

01:27.370 --> 01:29.330
We are the darkness.

02:09.008 --> 02:12.329
A trial, which potentially,
could have very far-reaching implications

02:12.449 --> 02:14.689
has just started in New York City.

02:15.849 --> 02:19.429
A jury will decide a case that could
impact the future of Internet privacy.

02:19.529 --> 02:24.609
Thousands of drugs came through
the black website called "Silk Road."

02:24.969 --> 02:28.869
The government overstepped their boundaries
to acquire the info they claim they have.

02:28.969 --> 02:30.429
This is not going away.

02:30.529 --> 02:35.249
This is gonna be the biggest takedown
of what is currently in existence.

02:40.049 --> 02:42.749
On January 13, 2015,

02:42.849 --> 02:46.249
a criminal trial began
for the accused leader of the Silk Road,

02:46.369 --> 02:50.409
a black market in an area of the Internet
known as "the deep web."

02:52.409 --> 02:54.309
The deep web is vast,

02:54.409 --> 02:57.149
thousands of times larger
than the visible Internet,

02:57.249 --> 02:59.229
what's called the "surface web."

02:59.329 --> 03:01.289
But the deep web is not a place.

03:01.409 --> 03:04.869
It simply accounts for all of
the unindexed content online...

03:04.969 --> 03:07.549
banking data, administrative
code for governments,

03:07.649 --> 03:09.549
corporations and universities.

03:09.649 --> 03:12.609
It's like looking under
the hood of the Internet.

03:12.729 --> 03:16.269
Over time, the deep web became
inhabited by people of all types

03:16.369 --> 03:19.169
who wanted to use
this terrain for privacy.

03:19.289 --> 03:22.589
This hidden area of the deep web
is called the "dark net"

03:22.689 --> 03:25.769
and it's accessible
with a software service called "Tor,"

03:25.889 --> 03:30.989
originally developed by the US military
and now open source and publicly funded.

03:31.089 --> 03:35.109
And while law enforcement and the media have
painted a picture that Tor and the dark net

03:35.209 --> 03:37.229
are nefarious tools for criminals,

03:37.329 --> 03:40.549
it's important to understand that
they are largely used for good

03:40.649 --> 03:45.289
by government agencies, journalists
and dissidents around the world.

03:51.049 --> 03:53.609
In the summer of 2011,

03:53.729 --> 03:56.709
an ad for the Silk Road
appeared on the dark net.

03:56.809 --> 04:00.749
The Silk Road was an underground
exchange for any type of goods,

04:00.849 --> 04:03.689
but mostly it was used for drugs.

04:03.809 --> 04:06.149
There have always been
drug markets online,

04:06.249 --> 04:10.889
but none with the scale, sophistication
and ease of use as the Silk Road.

04:11.009 --> 04:13.129
It would not remain underground for long.

04:14.089 --> 04:17.869
Hundreds of thousands of users
use the impossible-to-trace website

04:17.969 --> 04:22.029
which sells drugs,
forged documents and even hit men.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.029
It's called the Silk Road.

04:24.129 --> 04:28.769
Just look at some of the 13,000 items
offered through that underground site.

04:28.889 --> 04:32.229
Ultra clean cocaine, clean and real LSD,

04:32.329 --> 04:35.589
high grade MDMA, also known as "Molly"...

04:35.689 --> 04:37.609
all with fast and free shipping.

04:37.729 --> 04:41.609
It generated roughly $1.2 billion in sales

04:41.729 --> 04:46.149
with nearly 960,000 users,
both buyers and sellers,

04:46.249 --> 04:49.308
in the US and more than a dozen
other countries worldwide.

04:49.408 --> 04:52.488
YouTube videos like this one
with 15,000 views

04:52.608 --> 04:57.228
tell anyone how to download
an untraceable technology known as Tor

04:57.328 --> 05:00.608
that pulls data from thousands
of computers worldwide

05:00.728 --> 05:03.308
to create this wide open marketplace.

05:03.408 --> 05:08.128
This hidden Internet is underpinned
by a virtual currency called "Bitcoin."

05:08.248 --> 05:10.568
Bitcoins offer anonymized transactions,

05:10.688 --> 05:14.368
which can be almost impossible
for the police to trace.

05:14.488 --> 05:18.888
Heroin, opium, cannabis, ecstasy,
psychedelics, stimulants...

05:20.728 --> 05:23.168
opioids. And here they are.

05:23.288 --> 05:25.408
So, oxycodone, all of those.

05:25.528 --> 05:29.608
Codeine, black tar heroin.
You name it, they have it.

05:29.728 --> 05:33.408
They're all listed in the light of day.
It's unbelievable.

05:34.008 --> 05:37.668
The Silk Road's success was largely due
to an innovative combination

05:37.768 --> 05:39.468
of Tor and Bitcoin.

05:39.568 --> 05:44.348
Bitcoin is a technology that uses
cryptographic code to create digital currency.

05:44.448 --> 05:48.228
The sender transmits their Bitcoin code
through a ledger called the "block chain"

05:48.328 --> 05:50.048
to arrive at the recipient.

05:50.168 --> 05:52.608
Bitcoin is not perfectly anonymous.

05:52.728 --> 05:57.508
But if used carefully, it facilitates
online purchases without revealing identity.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.268
Bitcoin was an ideal currency
for the Silk Road,

06:00.368 --> 06:01.968
because it allows for anonymity

06:02.088 --> 06:05.408
and is outside the control
of banks and governments.

06:11.448 --> 06:15.648
I really became aware of the Silk Road
when Adrian Chen at Gawker,

06:15.768 --> 06:17.568
did his profile.

06:19.768 --> 06:23.148
I think in a way, that story, as much as
it documented the Silk Road,

06:23.248 --> 06:27.868
it created the Silk Road, too. I mean...
it drove so many people to the site.

06:27.968 --> 06:32.168
I think it probably was an order of magnitude
increase in users on the Silk Road.

06:32.288 --> 06:34.788
So from that point on,
I felt like I had missed the story

06:34.888 --> 06:38.268
and I wanted the next big story
on the Silk Road.

06:38.368 --> 06:42.588
But I was also just fascinated
with the community that was...

06:42.688 --> 06:45.148
you know, being created there.

06:45.248 --> 06:48.968
eBay doesn't have that kind
of user community.

06:49.088 --> 06:53.228
This was like a really tight-knit
movement of people.

06:53.328 --> 06:57.028
It was a fascinating thing
just to lurk around in.

06:57.128 --> 07:00.828
It's a certifiable,
one-stop shop for illegal drugs

07:00.928 --> 07:03.588
that represents the most brazen attempt

07:03.688 --> 07:06.528
to peddle drugs online
that we have ever seen.

07:06.648 --> 07:09.328
It's more brazen
than anything else by light-years.

07:09.448 --> 07:12.508
I mean, they had a really big,
you know, target on their back.

07:12.608 --> 07:17.548
And they even had been taunting,
to some extent, law enforcement

07:17.648 --> 07:21.348
and, you know, the powers that be
by doing this in the open.

07:21.448 --> 07:24.608
And that's actually part of what
this marketplace is all about.

07:24.728 --> 07:28.708
It's not so much about selling drugs
as much as it is to say...

07:28.808 --> 07:32.648
to make a political statement
of sorts, right?

07:32.768 --> 07:35.627
"This shouldn't be prohibited.
We're free to do what we want

07:35.727 --> 07:37.887
and we have the technology to do it.
So there."

07:38.567 --> 07:41.147
The news around the Silk Road
came almost entirely

07:41.247 --> 07:43.567
from law enforcement
and government officials

07:43.687 --> 07:47.427
with little insight from those
who were behind the market itself.

07:47.527 --> 07:51.067
So the core architects and vendors
of the Silk Road were sought out

07:51.167 --> 07:56.067
using encryption keys to verify their
identities and preserving their anonymity.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.907
This is the first time
they have spoken publicly.

07:59.007 --> 08:03.207
[The Silk Road forums were a better
community than I've ever seen in real life.]

08:03.327 --> 08:07.367
[There were many threads that had great
political and philosophical discussions.]

08:07.487 --> 08:09.427
[Sure there were illegal things going on,]

08:09.527 --> 08:13.087
[but this was a real community
of like minded people.]

08:13.847 --> 08:16.367
The Silk Road didn't appear
to have a single leader.

08:16.647 --> 08:19.587
There were the regular posts
from the systems administrator,

08:19.687 --> 08:23.167
but otherwise the service appeared to be
primarily community-run.

08:23.287 --> 08:25.827
Then on February 5, 2012,

08:25.927 --> 08:28.267
after a highly successful
first year of business,

08:28.367 --> 08:30.707
the Silk Road administrator
made an announcement...

08:30.807 --> 08:32.986
[I need an identity
separate from the site,]

08:33.087 --> 08:35.527
[and the enterprise
of which I am only a part.]

08:35.727 --> 08:38.667
[I need a name. Drum roll, please...]

08:38.767 --> 08:42.006
[My new name is... Dread Pirate Roberts.]

08:42.126 --> 08:44.747
- You're the Dread Pirate Roberts, admit it.
- With pride.

08:44.847 --> 08:47.787
The Dread Pirate Roberts was cribbed
from the mythical character

08:47.887 --> 08:52.067
from the novel and film "The Princess Bride,"
and the choice was no accident.

08:52.167 --> 08:55.047
In the original story by William Goldman,
the Dread Pirate Roberts

08:55.167 --> 08:59.547
was a nom de guerre handed down from
user to user and passed along eternally.

08:59.647 --> 09:02.527
The man I inherited it from was not
the real Dread Pirate Roberts either.

09:02.687 --> 09:06.227
The real Roberts has been retired 15 years
and I have been Roberts ever since.

09:06.327 --> 09:08.507
I shall retire and hand the name
over to someone else.

09:08.607 --> 09:11.107
This Dread Pirate Roberts, or DPR,

09:11.207 --> 09:13.467
would come to spearhead
the Silk Road forums

09:13.567 --> 09:16.807
and was generally assumed to be
the creator and owner of the site.

09:16.927 --> 09:18.747
The Dread Pirate Roberts
to me seemed to be

09:18.847 --> 09:21.787
kind of the most interesting figure
in that whole world.

09:21.887 --> 09:25.427
On the Silk Road forums, he was
constantly posting these manifestos

09:25.527 --> 09:30.147
and love letters to his users
and libertarian philosophical treaties.

09:30.247 --> 09:33.567
And he even had like this...
Dread Pirate Roberts book club

09:33.687 --> 09:36.827
where he hosted discussions
of Austrian economics

09:36.927 --> 09:39.287
and free market philosophy.

09:39.407 --> 09:41.407
At the same time, nobody knew who he was.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.007
He had never spoken to the press before.

09:44.127 --> 09:48.007
I approached him on the Silk Road
forum mid-2012 and...

09:48.127 --> 09:51.007
started kind of just like trying
to persuade him to talk,

09:51.127 --> 09:54.807
chipping away at him
and just bugging him constantly.

09:58.007 --> 10:01.087
The actual trigger, I think
that made him decide to talk

10:01.207 --> 10:04.647
was this competing
dark website called "Atlantis."

10:04.767 --> 10:09.367
They were really much more aggressive
in their marketing than the Silk Road.

10:10.127 --> 10:12.027
They put out this YouTube video

10:12.127 --> 10:17.767
advertising Atlantis as the new,
better dark web drug site.

10:17.887 --> 10:20.126
So when I went back
to the Dread Pirate Roberts

10:20.246 --> 10:22.246
and said, "You know,
I'm going to do this story.

10:22.366 --> 10:25.026
It can either be about Atlantis
or it can be about you,"

10:25.126 --> 10:27.546
I think he realized that,
you know, that...

10:27.646 --> 10:31.426
he was a savvy business guy who realized
he had to talk at that point.

10:31.526 --> 10:34.566
He did have a kind of political message
that he wanted to get out,

10:34.686 --> 10:37.126
and I could see that in what
he was posting on the forums.

10:37.246 --> 10:39.366
So I kind of played up to that
and I told him like,

10:39.486 --> 10:43.486
"I can be the vessel for you to talk about
what the Silk Road really represents,"

10:43.606 --> 10:45.126
and I think that that appealed to him.

10:45.246 --> 10:48.366
So it took eight months, but finally
he did agree to an interview.

10:51.126 --> 10:54.106
Of course, he didn't tell me
anything about himself...

10:54.206 --> 10:57.126
where he lives, you know,
his age, identity,

10:57.246 --> 10:59.646
anything that could be
remotely identifying.

11:02.686 --> 11:05.786
"I didn't start the Silk Road.
My predecessor did.

11:05.886 --> 11:09.686
"From what I understand it was
an original idea to combine Bitcoin and Tor

11:09.806 --> 11:12.646
"to create an anonymous market.
Everything was in place.

11:12.766 --> 11:14.406
He just put the pieces together.

11:14.526 --> 11:18.846
"The most I'm willing to reveal is that I am
not the first administrator of Silk Road."

11:18.966 --> 11:21.066
He was incredibly secretive, of course,

11:21.166 --> 11:24.026
about the inner workings
of the Silk Road and...

11:24.126 --> 11:26.106
you know, his own identity, of course.

11:26.206 --> 11:30.086
I mean he was hunted by every law
enforcement agency that you can imagine.

11:33.286 --> 11:35.746
"The management of Silk Road
is a collaborative effort.

11:35.846 --> 11:38.826
"It's not just me making sure
Silk Road runs smoothly.

11:38.926 --> 11:42.786
"More often than not, the best ideas
come from the community itself."

11:42.886 --> 11:45.926
But he did tell me some interesting things
about how he viewed himself and...

11:46.046 --> 11:48.566
and the way that the Silk Road works.

11:50.646 --> 11:54.346
"We don't allow the sale of anything that's
main purpose is to harm innocent people

11:54.446 --> 11:57.386
"or that it was necessary to harm
innocent people to bring to market.

11:57.486 --> 11:59.706
"For example,
anything stolen is forbidden.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.786
"Counterfeit money and coupons
which are used to defraud people.

12:02.886 --> 12:05.706
"Hit men aren't allowed
and neither is child pornography.

12:05.806 --> 12:08.906
No substance on Silk Road
falls under those guidelines."

12:09.006 --> 12:14.246
This went beyond just, you know,
like legalizing marijuana or even heroin.

12:14.366 --> 12:19.186
He wanted to see a new relationship
between individuals and the government,

12:19.286 --> 12:22.806
where the government was...
you know, basically hamstrung

12:22.926 --> 12:25.726
and couldn't control
what people bought and sold.

12:28.686 --> 12:33.066
"At its core, Silk Road is a way
to get around regulation from the state.

12:33.166 --> 12:37.206
"The state tries to control nearly every
aspect of our lives. Not just drug use.

12:37.486 --> 12:41.426
"Anywhere they do that, there's an
opportunity to live your life as you see fit,

12:41.526 --> 12:43.686
despite their efforts."

12:43.886 --> 12:47.486
I shouldn't generally say this kind of thing,
but I really liked the Dread Pirate Roberts

12:47.606 --> 12:50.266
that I interviewed.
I thought he was, you know...

12:50.366 --> 12:54.946
a really super-interesting guy
with a really coherent philosophy.

12:55.046 --> 12:59.206
He came across to me as this kind of
middle-aged, wise man figure, you know?

12:59.446 --> 13:03.486
But not everyone on Silk Road
believed in libertarian philosophy.

13:03.606 --> 13:08.185
Bringing an end to the drug war was
the agenda that truly united the community.

13:08.285 --> 13:11.545
[A huge reason why DPR
put the website up,]

13:11.645 --> 13:14.285
[and allowed the market to begin with,
and took the risk]

13:14.405 --> 13:18.025
[was because... needed to be
a violence reduction]

13:18.125 --> 13:21.445
[in purchasing drugs.
'Cause it's gonna happen]

13:21.565 --> 13:24.125
[and the reason it's gonna happen
is because of the War on Drugs.]

13:26.405 --> 13:30.105
[The violence isn't just from the people
buying and selling the drugs...]

13:30.205 --> 13:32.665
[The violence is from
the police departments...]

13:32.765 --> 13:35.965
[and the federal agents
prosecuting this war.]

13:36.085 --> 13:39.325
[And not to mention the horrendous violence
we commit overseas on people.]

13:39.685 --> 13:42.845
[We're the biggest bully on the planet
when it comes to drugs.]

13:43.165 --> 13:48.305
[The fact that more than 50%
of this country has said to the DEAD...]

13:48.405 --> 13:50.445
[we don't want you
prosecuting this war anymore.]

13:50.565 --> 13:52.425
[They need to demonize drugs.]

13:52.525 --> 13:57.445
[The War on Drugs is, you know,
all about fear, uncertainty and doubt.]

13:58.445 --> 14:02.025
I could see that the Silk Road
wasn't just another cyber-criminal scheme.

14:02.125 --> 14:05.925
This was a guy who saw himself
as the leader of a movement.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.665
"One thing I've learned playing
Dread Pirate Roberts

14:08.765 --> 14:12.665
is that your actions are sure
to please some and infuriate others.

14:12.765 --> 14:16.025
"But we can't stay silent forever.
We have an important message.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.585
"And the time is ripe
for the world to hear it.

14:18.685 --> 14:22.405
"What we're doing isn't about
scoring drugs or sticking it to the man.

14:22.525 --> 14:26.225
"It's about standing up for our rights
as human beings and refusing to submit

14:26.325 --> 14:27.905
"when we've done no wrong.

14:28.005 --> 14:30.505
"Silk Road is a vehicle for that message.

14:30.605 --> 14:33.125
All else is secondary."

14:33.685 --> 14:36.925
The Silk Road functioned because
the Dread Pirate Roberts was trusted.

14:37.045 --> 14:41.185
At any point, he could've shut down the Silk
Road and run away with everyone's Bitcoins.

14:41.285 --> 14:44.425
We've seen that happen
with a bunch of other dark web businesses.

14:44.525 --> 14:47.525
But he didn't, and I think
people believed that he wouldn't

14:47.645 --> 14:51.905
because they felt that he was
a true believer in this kind of radically

14:52.005 --> 14:56.425
libertarian, crypto-anarchic
philosophy that, you know,

14:56.525 --> 14:59.205
goes back to the cypherpunks of the 1990s.

15:00.245 --> 15:04.365
Twenty-five years ago, in the Bay Area,
a burgeoning group of mathematicians,

15:04.485 --> 15:08.285
crypto-anarchists and hackers
began to meet in each other's homes.

15:08.605 --> 15:12.905
This tight-knit group came to be
casually known as the "cypherpunks."

15:13.005 --> 15:15.565
These original members
were not socially motivated,

15:15.725 --> 15:19.065
but more concerned with the hard math
of cryptographic technology

15:19.165 --> 15:23.645
and the broader philosophy of anonymity,
individual liberty and privacy.

15:23.765 --> 15:27.065
The government has this clear policy
of access to all plain text,

15:27.165 --> 15:29.145
meaning whatever you're saying,
they want access to.

15:29.245 --> 15:31.425
If it's stored on your hard disk,
they want access to it.

15:31.525 --> 15:33.565
If it so goes over the wire,
they want access to it.

15:33.685 --> 15:37.165
If you are proxying speech for someone
else, they wanna know who it is.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.325
The cypherpunks were instrumental
in the growing movement

15:40.445 --> 15:43.145
towards privacy and anonymity online.

15:43.245 --> 15:47.305
And they would pioneer the way
into the hidden corners of the Internet.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.925
Maybe the big turning point
for the cypherpunks,

15:50.045 --> 15:52.744
I think, was WikiLeaks and Julian Assange

15:52.844 --> 15:56.024
and Jacob Appelbaum's idea
of what it means to be a cypherpunk.

15:56.124 --> 15:58.104
You cannot trust a government

15:58.204 --> 16:00.904
to implement the policies
that it says that it's implementing.

16:01.004 --> 16:04.444
And so we must provide
the underlying tools,

16:04.564 --> 16:07.304
secret cryptographic codes
that the government couldn't spy on

16:07.404 --> 16:10.784
to everyone as a sort of use of force.

16:10.884 --> 16:16.164
And a government no matter how hard
it tries, if the cyphers are good,

16:16.284 --> 16:19.004
cannot break into
your communications directly.

16:19.124 --> 16:21.544
Force of authority
is derived from violence.

16:21.644 --> 16:24.464
One must acknowledge with cryptography,
no amount of violence

16:24.564 --> 16:26.324
- will ever solve a math problem.
- Exactly.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.104
And this is the important key.
It doesn't mean you can't be tortured.

16:29.204 --> 16:32.064
It doesn't mean they can't try to bug
your house or subvert it in some way,

16:32.164 --> 16:34.784
but it means if they find an encrypted
message it doesn't matter if they have

16:34.884 --> 16:37.224
the force of the authority
behind everything that they do.

16:37.324 --> 16:38.864
They cannot solve that math problem.

16:38.964 --> 16:42.524
This movement is not about
the destruction of law.

16:42.644 --> 16:46.464
This movement is not about
the destruction of law.

16:46.564 --> 16:49.244
It is about the construction of law.

16:49.364 --> 16:53.404
These are guys who want to create
encryption tools that everybody can use.

16:53.524 --> 16:54.904
It's not just for the elite.

16:55.004 --> 16:58.084
It's trying to shift the way
that the Internet works

16:58.204 --> 17:01.884
to provide secrecy and anonymity
and privacy to everyone...

17:02.004 --> 17:05.284
you know, so like...
it's a much more populist movement.

17:05.684 --> 17:10.243
There is a community of people
in the security and cryptography space

17:10.364 --> 17:14.364
who want to live in a world where
the government cannot record their emails,

17:14.483 --> 17:18.483
cannot listen to their telephone calls,
cannot see who they're spending time with.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.584
And they're trying to build tools.

17:20.684 --> 17:23.144
They're trying to build
protocols and services

17:23.243 --> 17:27.243
that can facilitate that kind of anonymous
and private exchange of information.

17:27.364 --> 17:31.164
I actually think this all comes down
to wanting to live a free life.

17:31.284 --> 17:34.944
And the recognition which
really predates all technology,

17:35.044 --> 17:37.984
that an observed life
is not a completely free life,

17:38.084 --> 17:41.464
that a zone of privacy
is just a core human value.

17:41.564 --> 17:46.284
And the technology
to me is just an incarnation

17:46.524 --> 17:48.644
of those basic human values.

17:48.764 --> 17:51.744
And I think that the people
who are trying to build

17:51.844 --> 17:54.564
currencies that are free of tracking
and government control

17:54.684 --> 17:57.464
and technologies that let you
have a private conversation

17:57.564 --> 18:01.824
and those kinds of things
are just people who are seeing

18:01.924 --> 18:06.904
that the technology can both enable
and disable that space.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.844
There are more cypherpunks
than ever before.

18:10.204 --> 18:14.464
They want to entirely cripple
the government's ability to enforce law.

18:14.564 --> 18:20.104
They want cryptography to make the rules
instead of law enforcement.

18:20.204 --> 18:24.444
Cody Wilson is a crypto-anarchist
best known for developing the Liberator,

18:24.564 --> 18:29.544
a 3D printable gun that was downloaded
100,000 times in two days.

18:29.644 --> 18:32.584
When a group of baby boomers are told,
okay now 3D printers will print guns,

18:32.684 --> 18:36.684
they can do nothing but say, "Well, it's been
nice living in the world I used to know."

18:36.804 --> 18:40.803
We want to question the very foundation,
evacuate the very foundation

18:40.923 --> 18:46.283
that this order, moral,
ethical, political, is founded on.

18:47.003 --> 18:50.523
To see beyond good and evil
and to allow something else to happen.

18:50.923 --> 18:53.383
This is where the figure of DPR
is so interesting to me.

18:53.483 --> 18:56.423
Like is he a liberal?
Like is he a Misesian like he says he is?

18:56.523 --> 18:58.503
He believes in libertarian
market principles,

18:58.603 --> 19:01.503
and you know man against the state
and all these these principles of freedom

19:01.603 --> 19:04.543
and axioms of... or is he someone else?

19:04.643 --> 19:08.023
Like who I hope he is or someone
like I would try to hope to be,

19:08.123 --> 19:10.743
who's just looking for a way, a mechanism,

19:10.843 --> 19:13.703
to help peek beyond
good and evil a little bit. And...

19:13.803 --> 19:18.503
is he more enthusiastic about what he's...
what he's allowed to be opened up,

19:18.603 --> 19:20.423
the doors he's opening.

19:20.523 --> 19:23.703
Of course, there will be
a dark side to the dark web.

19:23.803 --> 19:27.423
And if we want to enable this...
this true crypto-anarchic future,

19:27.523 --> 19:30.783
anyone who's working on that, I think,
has to reckon with the fact that...

19:30.883 --> 19:33.863
they're going to be enabling
really nasty things

19:33.963 --> 19:38.523
along with this kind of information freedom
revolution that they're taking part in.

19:39.083 --> 19:42.583
By August 2012, business was booming.

19:42.683 --> 19:47.323
The Silk Road had become a thriving,
anonymous and unregulated black market.

19:47.443 --> 19:51.323
The Internet being used in this way,
posed a major threat to the government,

19:51.443 --> 19:53.483
greater perhaps than selling drugs.

19:53.603 --> 19:56.523
Even as a law enforcement officer,
I still wouldn't know

19:56.643 --> 20:00.983
where to go and buy crack
on the streets or buy heroin,

20:01.083 --> 20:03.143
but I do know how
to go online and find it.

20:03.243 --> 20:06.083
It's downloading some software
and the next thing you know you're there

20:06.203 --> 20:09.923
and you can purchase a service
or drugs very easily.

20:10.723 --> 20:14.463
Since when does a teenager become
obsessed with the daily mail delivery?

20:14.563 --> 20:17.983
Fidgeting and pacing made
this Fisher's mom suspicious.

20:18.083 --> 20:22.823
So when her family's mail arrived,
she grabbed it and found a cartoon DVD box

20:22.923 --> 20:27.363
addressed to her son with something extra,
a package of white crystals.

20:27.483 --> 20:31.803
So she confronted her 14-year-old
and both their lives changed forever.

20:32.123 --> 20:34.823
I don't think anybody really cared
in law enforcement

20:34.923 --> 20:37.543
until Senator Schumer went, "Oh, my God,
we've gotta do something about this."

20:37.643 --> 20:40.323
Today I'm calling on the DEA
and the Department of Justice

20:40.443 --> 20:44.003
to immediately shut this site down
before more damage is done.

20:44.123 --> 20:46.923
Because if you think about what
law enforcement at the federal level

20:47.043 --> 20:49.143
has to do to even start a case,

20:49.243 --> 20:52.643
I don't think this case would've been started
if it wasn't for some political impetus

20:52.763 --> 20:55.643
by, you know, a senator saying,
"We need to look into this."

20:55.763 --> 21:00.263
The FBI today shut down what it's calling
the most sophisticated Internet site

21:00.363 --> 21:04.843
in the business of selling hard drugs,
including heroin, cocaine and LSD.

21:05.283 --> 21:08.703
Anyone trying to log on to the website
today found this notice:

21:08.803 --> 21:10.363
"Shut down by the FBI."

21:10.483 --> 21:13.223
It was a sophisticated
electronic smokescreen

21:13.323 --> 21:16.023
and it took federal agents
almost two years.

21:16.123 --> 21:19.483
They were able to infiltrate the site,
but they made some of these purchases

21:19.603 --> 21:21.723
themselves using undercover identities.

21:21.843 --> 21:26.822
The secretive Dread Pirate Roberts was
arrested in the most unlikely of places...

21:26.922 --> 21:30.242
this local public library
in this San Francisco neighborhood.

21:30.362 --> 21:33.942
The FBI seized $3.6 million

21:34.042 --> 21:38.402
of Bitcoin's biggest haul
in its five-year history.

21:51.722 --> 21:54.782
When the criminal complaint
first appeared in October,

21:54.882 --> 21:58.082
it describes this 29-year-old
kid named Ross Ulbricht.

22:00.322 --> 22:04.542
Not only do they say that he has run this
billion-dollar plus black market conspiracy

22:04.642 --> 22:07.542
and they accuse him of drug trafficking
and money laundering

22:07.642 --> 22:09.922
and somehow computer
hacking charges, as well,

22:10.042 --> 22:13.882
which is something that I had never
associated with the Silk Road.

22:14.522 --> 22:18.402
But then also in this criminal
complaint there is outlined

22:18.522 --> 22:20.822
his plot to pay for the murders

22:20.922 --> 22:24.182
of a potential informant
and a blackmailer.

22:24.282 --> 22:26.522
It seems at least one Silk Road user

22:26.642 --> 22:29.542
threatened to reveal the identities
of thousands of others.

22:29.642 --> 22:34.882
So investigators say Ulbricht tried to
execute a Murder-For-Hire on that user,

22:35.002 --> 22:39.802
offering $150,000
to a would-be hit man because...

22:39.922 --> 22:42.662
"This kind of behavior
is unforgivable to me.

22:42.762 --> 22:47.042
Especially here on Silk Road,
anonymity is sacrosant.

22:47.162 --> 22:49.022
It threw me for a loop. It was really not

22:49.122 --> 22:51.582
the Dread Pirate Roberts
that I had ever imagined.

22:51.682 --> 22:54.442
This connection between Ross Ulbricht,

22:54.562 --> 22:57.822
who plenty of evidence suggests
that he was involved in the Silk Road.

22:57.922 --> 23:01.122
They, after all, seized his laptop
while he was logged in to the Silk Road.

23:01.242 --> 23:02.682
He was caught red-handed.

23:02.802 --> 23:05.602
But these two personalities,
these two personas,

23:05.722 --> 23:08.582
do seem to be almost schizophrenic.

23:08.682 --> 23:12.022
It's so difficult to imagine
that they are the same person.

23:12.122 --> 23:16.322
And so the FBI's whole case
is based on the idea if they can show

23:16.442 --> 23:18.362
that Dread Pirate Roberts
is Ross Ulbricht?

23:18.482 --> 23:20.582
Right. That's the most
important part, right?

23:20.682 --> 23:23.782
Because he was trying to hide
his identity on the site as well.

23:23.882 --> 23:26.942
So the first thing they're gonna
have to do is definitively link him

23:27.042 --> 23:29.522
as the person who runs the site.

23:34.002 --> 23:36.542
Oh, man, it was like
it was yesterday, actually.

23:36.642 --> 23:41.242
I was on my computer and...
I was on Facebook.

23:41.362 --> 23:45.882
And there's this guy that I know
and he's very into like Bitcoin

23:46.002 --> 23:47.962
and cryptocurrencies and stuff like that.

23:48.082 --> 23:52.382
He posted this article and it says,
"Ross Ulbricht Arrested."

23:52.482 --> 23:55.702
And I pull up Lyn's...
G-chat and I'm like,

23:55.802 --> 23:59.742
"What is going on? Like why is..."
And I'm looking at Ross' page...

23:59.842 --> 24:03.222
Picture, you know, about being arrested.
What is this?

24:03.322 --> 24:06.262
She says, "We don't even know.
We're leaving Costa Rica right now."

24:06.362 --> 24:09.621
I mean, they were on their way,
but it blew my mind.

24:09.721 --> 24:11.921
I mean totally blew my mind.

24:15.761 --> 24:19.141
Ross William Ulbricht grew up
in a suburb of Austin,

24:19.241 --> 24:23.381
the only son of Kirk and Lyn
with an older sister named Callie.

24:23.481 --> 24:26.581
It's a loving, tight-knit,
middle-class family.

24:26.681 --> 24:29.241
The Ulbrichts earn their income
from properties they built

24:29.361 --> 24:32.321
and rent on the Costa Rican coast.

24:32.441 --> 24:36.161
Ross was an avid outdoorsman,
an Eagle Scout like his father,

24:36.281 --> 24:39.041
and displayed an early aptitude for math.

24:39.321 --> 24:42.881
Ross earned a full scholarship
to the University of Texas at Dallas

24:43.001 --> 24:44.821
studying Physics.

24:44.921 --> 24:49.441
He graduated in 2006 and then won
another full scholarship to Penn State

24:49.641 --> 24:53.401
to pursue a Masters
in Material Science and Engineering.

24:53.521 --> 24:57.401
It was at Penn State that Ross began
a deep interest in libertarianism,

24:57.521 --> 25:02.081
particularly the work of Ludwig Von Mises
and the Austrian School of Economics.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.341
Yet by 2009, having completed his Masters,

25:05.441 --> 25:07.721
Ross seemed to be having
a change of life plan

25:07.841 --> 25:12.321
telling his mother he no longer had an
interest in pursuing a career in science

25:12.441 --> 25:15.221
and instead wanted to become
an entrepreneur.

25:15.321 --> 25:19.781
Ross moved back to Austin and opened
his own used book company, Good Wagon,

25:19.881 --> 25:23.221
donating a portion of the proceeds
to an inner city youth program

25:23.321 --> 25:25.561
and to a prison literacy project.

25:25.721 --> 25:29.981
I remember him saying, when we had coffee,
the last time we saw each other,

25:30.081 --> 25:34.681
I remember him saying that he wished
he had joined a fraternity in college.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.641
And I remember saying,
"Well, that's surprising."

25:36.761 --> 25:40.161
You know, I didn't really understand
that perspective,

25:40.281 --> 25:42.581
and I just remember him thinking,

25:42.681 --> 25:46.301
well, he focused a lot
on his studies in school

25:46.401 --> 25:49.581
and maybe didn't create the social network

25:49.681 --> 25:52.981
that he was looking for...
in... in school.

25:53.081 --> 25:58.561
But as far as where we saw each other
going or where we saw ourselves going...

25:59.441 --> 26:03.381
I think we both had a strong desire

26:03.481 --> 26:06.041
to be in control of our destiny.

26:06.161 --> 26:09.941
You know, again like when he started
the book company, totally natural.

26:10.041 --> 26:13.201
Not even something that I would've
questioned, where there are a lot of people

26:13.321 --> 26:17.201
that would never start their own business.
But for Ross, sure, you know, why not?

26:17.401 --> 26:21.021
But the business floundered
and Ross eventually shut it down.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.101
And if a post on his Linkedln page
was any indication,

26:24.201 --> 26:28.381
Ross had experienced a kind of epiphany
on the next way forward.

26:28.481 --> 26:31.361
Ulbricht wrote,
"Now my goals have shifted.

26:31.481 --> 26:35.001
"I want to use economic theory as a means
to abolish the use of coercion

26:35.121 --> 26:37.301
"and aggression amongst mankind.

26:37.401 --> 26:40.341
"To that end, I am creating
an economic simulation

26:40.441 --> 26:42.681
"to give people a first-hand experience

26:42.801 --> 26:46.601
"of what it would be like to live in a world
without the systemic use of force."

26:47.041 --> 26:51.181
From this moment, in late 2010,
Ross became something of a free spirit,

26:51.281 --> 26:53.541
eventually leaving
his parents' home in Austin

26:53.641 --> 26:56.220
to live with his sister Callie
in Sydney, Australia

26:56.320 --> 26:58.460
and then returning briefly to Austin.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.020
Throughout this period,
as far as his family knew,

27:01.120 --> 27:05.940
Ross' means of employment was working
on freelance projects in computer finance.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.140
I am Rene Pinnell, age 29.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.860
Today is December 6, 2012

27:11.960 --> 27:15.700
and we are in the Jewish
Contemporary Art Museum...

27:15.800 --> 27:21.160
and relationship to partner
is best friend.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.200
So, Ross, how did you come
to live in San Francisco?

27:25.840 --> 27:28.860
You twisted my arm until I said,

27:28.960 --> 27:31.480
"Fine, I'll come."

27:31.880 --> 27:34.500
I get a phone call from Rene,
"Ross, call me up.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.140
I've got an opportunity for you."
I'm like, "Okay."

27:37.240 --> 27:41.380
He's like, "Yeah, I'm doing
a startup here in San Francisco.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.740
I want you to be a part of it."

27:42.840 --> 27:45.260
The more I thought about it,
and the more he...

27:45.360 --> 27:48.120
laid out the pros and cons...

27:49.720 --> 27:53.240
the more it all just seemed like cosmic
and the right thing to do.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.780
So... yeah.

27:55.880 --> 27:59.920
I bought my ticket and two weeks later
I showed up at his doorstep.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.900
As Ross Ulbricht was making his way
from Australia to Austin,

28:04.000 --> 28:05.580
and eventually to San Francisco,

28:05.680 --> 28:08.380
the Silk Road was online
and growing steadily.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.320
So naturally it sparked the attention
of federal law enforcement

28:11.440 --> 28:15.960
and specifically the wing of the DHS
called Homeland Security Investigations,

28:16.080 --> 28:19.540
housed in the old Customs House
in Baltimore, Maryland.

28:19.640 --> 28:24.600
You have postal inspectors in Seattle
and Customs and Border Protection...

28:24.720 --> 28:28.140
intercepting mail shipments coming
from overseas full of drugs,

28:28.240 --> 28:30.340
full of... full of currency.

28:30.440 --> 28:34.480
And one thing that happens is
they all lead back to the Silk Road.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.840
And you have a number
of independent investigations

28:38.960 --> 28:42.080
sort of cropping up
around the same timeframe

28:42.200 --> 28:45.800
following different leads,
but all leading back to the same place.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.720
At the same time, the New York
Cyber-Crime Division of the FBI

28:49.840 --> 28:53.560
began their own investigation,
headed by Agent Chris Tarbell.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.660
There were people essentially online 24/7

28:56.760 --> 28:59.920
as part of the team
that was monitoring, gathering,

29:00.040 --> 29:01.920
even just the little bits of evidence.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.800
Informants were activated.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.320
The site was crawling with law enforcement
posing as vendors and buyers

29:07.440 --> 29:10.720
from the very beginning
of Silk Road's existence.

29:10.840 --> 29:16.880
In early 2012, HSI partnered with Tarbell's
FBI investigators as well as the DEA

29:17.000 --> 29:20.180
to mount an undercover operation called
"Marco Polo"

29:20.280 --> 29:24.100
with the intention of penetrating
the inner sanctum of the Silk Road.

29:24.200 --> 29:28.600
[I had a package seized from China in
January 2012 and thought nothing of it.]

29:28.720 --> 29:31.900
[I kept business as usual,
which was a stupid move.]

29:32.000 --> 29:34.260
[Fast forward to June 28th, 2012]

29:34.360 --> 29:39.040
[I was raided by ATF, DEA,
Secret Service, local police department]

29:39.160 --> 29:41.039
[and even a postal inspector.]

29:41.159 --> 29:42.299
[I was not detained.]

29:42.399 --> 29:47.239
[Rather, I was held in a van outside
for what they call "investigative detention."]

29:47.359 --> 29:49.879
[They kept me out of jail.
I was never booked or charged]

29:49.999 --> 29:53.839
[because my seized computers were more
useful to them if I was not behind bars.]

29:53.959 --> 29:56.399
[I'm also assuming they did this
with a number of Silk Road vendors]

29:56.519 --> 29:59.339
[to get a sort of organized crime
ring of their own.]

29:59.439 --> 30:01.179
The operation gained traction

30:01.279 --> 30:04.139
when an undercover agent
using the vendor name of "nob"

30:04.239 --> 30:08.819
was allegedly able to establish direct
communication with the Dread Pirate Roberts,

30:08.919 --> 30:11.299
which would lead
to a shocking turn of events.

30:11.399 --> 30:16.439
Nob complained to DPR about the small-fry
nature of most deals on the Silk Road.

30:16.559 --> 30:20.319
"It really isn't worth it
to do below 10 kilos," the agent wrote.

30:20.439 --> 30:22.979
DPR offered to help find a buyer for nob

30:23.079 --> 30:27.259
and allegedly turned to one of his most
trusted partners known only as "chronicpain"

30:27.359 --> 30:28.899
to put the deal together.

30:28.999 --> 30:31.319
Chronicpain had been one
of the core administrators

30:31.439 --> 30:32.919
of the Silk Road from the beginning,

30:33.039 --> 30:36.339
a frequent contributor to the forums
who shared the Silk Road vision

30:36.439 --> 30:40.679
for reducing harm in the drug trade,
but these halcyon days were about to end.

30:41.159 --> 30:43.299
In order to facilitate this drug deal,

30:43.399 --> 30:46.739
chronicpain gave the informant
his home address.

30:46.839 --> 30:51.059
Federal agents immediately apprehended
chronicpain at his Salt Lake City home

30:51.159 --> 30:54.959
and were surprised to discover
that this 47-year-old family man

30:55.079 --> 30:58.659
named Curtis Clark Green
was a dark net criminal.

30:58.759 --> 31:00.319
At some point they're going
to catch one of those people.

31:00.439 --> 31:02.079
And what do you do in a typical drug case?

31:02.199 --> 31:04.599
You roll that person over
as a cooperating witness.

31:04.719 --> 31:07.779
And in this case, one of them
they got really lucky

31:07.879 --> 31:09.939
and he was an administrator on the system.

31:10.039 --> 31:14.259
Green had access to other Silk Road
users' accounts and financial records,

31:14.359 --> 31:16.099
including Dread Pirate Roberts.

31:16.199 --> 31:20.659
"I have to assume he will sing,"
DPR wrote to nob, the undercover agent.

31:20.759 --> 31:24.439
"I'd like him beat up."
Then, the next day, he allegedly wrote...

31:24.559 --> 31:27.799
"Can you change the order
to execute rather than torture?"

31:27.919 --> 31:32.739
A murder was staged. And a photograph
of Green's bloody body was sent to DPR,

31:32.839 --> 31:35.219
who paid for the hit in Bitcoin.

31:35.319 --> 31:37.919
There would be five more alleged
Murders-For-Hire,

31:38.039 --> 31:41.299
including ordered hits against
a blackmailer, a scammer

31:41.399 --> 31:44.319
and an apparent contract
with the Hells Angels.

31:44.439 --> 31:47.799
The names of two of these victims
were found to be fictitious.

31:47.919 --> 31:51.619
And authorities have no evidence
of any murders being carried out.

31:51.719 --> 31:54.739
The alleged attempted murder
of Curtis Green allowed the authorities

31:54.839 --> 31:57.779
to obtain an indictment
against Dread Pirate Roberts,

31:57.879 --> 32:02.579
charging him with drug offenses,
attempted witness murder and Murder-For-Hire.

32:02.679 --> 32:06.999
Of course, they still had no idea
who the Dread Pirate Roberts actually was.

32:07.119 --> 32:09.919
So the embedded agents
continued to communicate with DPR,

32:10.039 --> 32:12.679
and DPR continued to respond.

32:14.639 --> 32:19.639
In June of 2013, Ross moved into an
apartment that he found on Craigslist.

32:19.759 --> 32:24.579
Allegedly, he did not give his roommates his
real name and was known as Joshua Terrey.

32:24.679 --> 32:29.478
At the same time, IRS agent Gary Alford
was investigating the Silk Road

32:29.598 --> 32:33.058
and through a simple Google search
was able to locate an early email

32:33.158 --> 32:37.138
on the open Internet discussing
the launch of the Silk Road marketplace

32:37.238 --> 32:41.778
and connect that email to an account
owned by Ross Ulbricht.

32:41.878 --> 32:44.718
One month later, postal inspectors
at the Canadian border

32:44.838 --> 32:48.238
seized a package of fake IDs
with Ross' image

32:48.358 --> 32:50.878
that were en route to his home address.

32:52.158 --> 32:56.438
Ross was visited at his apartment
by several DHS agents.

32:56.558 --> 32:59.418
The agents handed Ross
a false California driver's license

32:59.518 --> 33:01.858
that bore his picture,
but a different name.

33:01.958 --> 33:05.278
Ulbricht denied ownership
or knowledge of the fake IDs,

33:05.398 --> 33:07.998
and the agents simply left.

33:08.758 --> 33:11.938
If you suspect somebody
may be involved in a...

33:12.038 --> 33:13.778
large-scale criminal enterprise,

33:13.878 --> 33:16.338
going and knocking on a door
with some... you know,

33:16.438 --> 33:19.838
some evidence of fake IDs is important...

33:19.958 --> 33:22.778
because you can see the guy face-to-face.

33:22.878 --> 33:25.818
You may get some useful information
out of an interview.

33:25.918 --> 33:28.318
You may or may not want to take him
into custody on the spot.

33:28.438 --> 33:31.698
Let's sit back and let's...
let's really go after this

33:31.798 --> 33:35.618
in a you know, much more
global way, if you will,

33:35.718 --> 33:38.898
because there's a lot more
here than just one count of,

33:38.998 --> 33:40.658
you know, fake IDs.

33:40.758 --> 33:42.278
The next big break in the case

33:42.398 --> 33:46.198
would be achieved by FBI agent Tarbell
and his cyber-crime team,

33:46.318 --> 33:50.358
who had somehow located the Silk Road
servers in Germany and Iceland.

33:50.478 --> 33:53.978
How these hidden servers were found
has been a matter of controversy,

33:54.078 --> 33:57.538
but the FBI had their own copy
of the Silk Road server,

33:57.638 --> 34:01.498
and now they hoped to finally unmask
the Dread Pirate Roberts.

34:01.598 --> 34:04.038
[I decided there was a flaw
in this setup somewhere,]

34:04.158 --> 34:06.198
[I couldn't quite put my finger on it.]

34:06.318 --> 34:09.418
[But there was a flaw and I called up
my partner and said:]

34:09.518 --> 34:11.538
["There's a flaw, we've got
a limited amount of time,]

34:11.638 --> 34:13.757
[We need to make our money and get out.]

34:14.118 --> 34:17.958
Over the course of a year,
a Chicago-based agent from the DHS

34:18.078 --> 34:21.378
named Jared Der-Yeghiayan
had been embedded in the Silk Road,

34:21.478 --> 34:25.237
now posing as a high-ranking
moderator named "cirrus."

34:25.358 --> 34:28.598
With both the evidence connecting Ross
to the launch of the Silk Road

34:28.717 --> 34:34.078
and the incident with the fake IDs,
Ross became one of the primary suspects.

34:34.398 --> 34:38.858
On October 1st in a coordinated effort
between Der-Yeghiayan from the DHS

34:38.958 --> 34:42.818
and Tarbell's FBI squad,
a sting operation was launched.

34:42.918 --> 34:47.418
According to Der-Yeghiayan's testimony,
he staked out Ross' new residence.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.538
And using his pseudonym of cirrus,

34:49.638 --> 34:53.757
Der-Yeghiayan initiated a conversation
on the Silk Road with DPR.

34:53.878 --> 34:56.918
Moments later,
Ross went to the Glen Park Library,

34:57.038 --> 34:58.898
apparently to use their Wi-Fi.

34:58.998 --> 35:02.978
And when Der-Yeghiayan saw that DPR
was logged back into the Silk Road,

35:03.078 --> 35:06.298
he gave the order for Tarbell
and his squad to move in.

35:06.398 --> 35:09.118
It's an excitement that you
couldn't even buy off Silk Road.

35:09.238 --> 35:11.678
All the drugs you could buy
on the site, you...

35:11.798 --> 35:15.357
It's not the same excitement as catching
the guy. It's an adrenaline rush.

35:15.837 --> 35:18.817
Ross was apprehended
before he could encrypt his laptop.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.817
He was allegedly logged into
a Silk Road administration panel

35:21.917 --> 35:24.897
for customers needing DPR's attention.

35:24.997 --> 35:29.277
He was a dream for drug users,
because he was very technically adept

35:29.397 --> 35:34.237
and he was able to hide both
the website that he put together

35:34.357 --> 35:37.817
and the actual sales of illegal drugs

35:37.917 --> 35:41.677
that the drug sellers
would... make on his website.

35:41.957 --> 35:45.077
The Silk Road was seized and shut down,
and charges were announced

35:45.197 --> 35:48.397
against a number of core partners
and vendors from the site.

35:48.757 --> 35:51.517
Ross was held for over a month
in a jail in Oakland,

35:51.637 --> 35:53.557
awaiting extradition to New York.

35:54.037 --> 35:57.717
Ross's family was able to raise
over a million dollars for his bail.

35:57.917 --> 36:01.977
But the prosecution argued that due
to the alleged Murders-For-Hire,

36:02.077 --> 36:06.357
Ross was too dangerous to release
and so his bail was denied.

36:06.477 --> 36:08.017
I thought it was the wrong decision.

36:08.117 --> 36:10.337
He wouldn't have been a flight risk
and he's never been

36:10.437 --> 36:12.257
and is not a danger to anyone.

36:12.357 --> 36:18.317
[For him to say "I'm gonna put a hit out
on someone" is ludicrous.]

36:18.437 --> 36:23.077
[I can understand it being one
of these other DPR workers...]

36:23.637 --> 36:27.737
[getting all egotistical
and crazy and maniacal]

36:27.837 --> 36:31.237
[and doing it, that I could see.]

36:31.357 --> 36:34.857
There was more than one person
using the DPR account?

36:34.957 --> 36:41.697
[I believe it was at least 2 other people,
if not 3 at one point.]

36:41.797 --> 36:47.517
[It doesn't matter.
That's why they're dredging up this hit.]

36:48.397 --> 36:51.077
[Contract baloney.]

36:51.197 --> 36:54.957
[But because of the involvement
of a Senator and...]

36:55.917 --> 36:58.197
[all that other shit
they're gonna cook him.]

36:58.837 --> 37:03.157
The data seized from the Silk Road servers
included all internal private messages,

37:03.277 --> 37:06.797
which revealed that many people
collectively ran the site.

37:07.157 --> 37:09.377
One vendor with the user name
"Variety Jones"

37:09.477 --> 37:12.177
was active from the beginning
of the Silk Road.

37:12.277 --> 37:15.037
Jones gave many of the orders
for running the Silk Road,

37:15.157 --> 37:20.677
even instructing the systems administrator
to create the Dread Pirate Roberts persona.

37:20.997 --> 37:25.637
But Ross Ulbricht remained
the primary focus of the investigation.

37:25.997 --> 37:28.437
Ross has been incarcerated for over a year

37:28.557 --> 37:32.157
in the Metropolitan Detention Center
in Brooklyn awaiting trial.

37:32.277 --> 37:35.557
Six weeks of that time
was in solitary confinement.

37:35.677 --> 37:39.757
Ross plead not guilty and denies
being the Dread Pirate Roberts.

37:39.877 --> 37:44.417
His trial was set for November 10,
2014 in New York City.

37:44.517 --> 37:48.417
If convicted, Ross faces
a minimum sentence of 30 years

37:48.517 --> 37:52.197
with a maximum sentence of life in prison.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.557
Are you taking a video?

37:55.037 --> 37:57.597
- Should we...
- He's a hairy fucker.

37:57.717 --> 38:00.416
These big guys are generally not too...

38:00.516 --> 38:02.956
I would let him off somewhere.

38:03.076 --> 38:04.056
Where is he?

38:04.156 --> 38:06.876
You know, it's hard.
It's hard on a family.

38:06.996 --> 38:09.756
It really is, especially when
you love that person so much

38:09.876 --> 38:11.456
and you believe in them so much

38:11.556 --> 38:14.876
and you have such a daunting
Goliath of an opponent.

38:14.996 --> 38:17.396
It's... challenging.

38:17.556 --> 38:20.736
It's kind of like a death, in a way,
when you go like, "No, that can't be true,"

38:20.836 --> 38:22.716
and then you're like,
"Oh, yeah, it's true."

38:22.836 --> 38:25.056
And you go through that kind of shock.

38:25.156 --> 38:26.836
His dad, my husband...

38:26.996 --> 38:29.816
of course, he's trying to keep our business
going so we have a livelihood.

38:29.916 --> 38:32.816
And his sister is in... Australia

38:32.916 --> 38:34.736
and she's been helping, too, from there.

38:34.836 --> 38:36.476
I'm Ross' sister and I can tell you

38:36.596 --> 38:39.796
he has been a man of his word
and honor all his life.

38:39.916 --> 38:43.956
I was shocked to hear the news of his
arrest, but felt even more dismayed

38:44.076 --> 38:47.756
at what the media was writing
about him, not even knowing him.

38:49.316 --> 38:52.996
You know, I read things by people
who have not a clue who Ross really is.

38:55.276 --> 38:58.656
He's been tried and convicted
in the media.

38:58.756 --> 39:01.236
Nothing has been proven at all.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.796
I don't know what's happened to the
presumption of innocence in this country,

39:03.916 --> 39:08.156
but it is a constitutional right here
that we are innocent until proven guilty.

39:08.276 --> 39:11.956
Ross sent me this picture
of himself about a week ago.

39:12.076 --> 39:14.876
It was taken a couple
of weeks ago in prison.

39:14.996 --> 39:18.336
I guess sometimes they go around
and take pictures for the families.

39:18.436 --> 39:20.416
He is doing well...

39:20.516 --> 39:24.456
as well as can be expected,
of course, under the circumstances.

39:24.556 --> 39:27.856
And finally, after five months of delays,

39:27.956 --> 39:32.736
he has had access to the discovery,
the evidence that the prosecution has.

39:32.836 --> 39:35.616
And so he's been working
very hard going through that.

39:35.716 --> 39:37.936
We are asking the prosecution,

39:38.036 --> 39:41.636
"How did you find the server,"
and they're not saying.

39:42.116 --> 39:43.976
We have to know how they found the server

39:44.076 --> 39:47.696
in order to see if Ross' Fourth
Amendment rights have been violated.

39:47.796 --> 39:51.796
And how would anyone know if the evidence
had been tampered with or anything else

39:51.916 --> 39:55.516
if it's not revealed
how they found the server?

39:55.636 --> 39:58.896
There were 14 searches
and seizures in this case,

39:58.996 --> 40:02.496
which is a... a fishing expedition

40:02.596 --> 40:05.456
into a person's total property.

40:05.556 --> 40:09.076
Unlimited rummaging through all of
their things to see what they can find.

40:09.236 --> 40:12.216
When the criminal complaints
first appeared in October,

40:12.316 --> 40:15.316
I think the supporters
of the Dread Pirate Roberts

40:15.436 --> 40:17.216
and the Silk Road just scattered.

40:17.316 --> 40:20.916
Because suddenly this thing that had
seemed like an idealistic community

40:21.036 --> 40:25.536
built around non-violence and...
you know, libertarian free commerce,

40:25.636 --> 40:28.656
suddenly seemed instead like
this bloody criminal conspiracy.

40:28.756 --> 40:34.296
And a guy who probably otherwise
would have been a kind of...

40:34.396 --> 40:36.196
political cause célèbre,

40:36.316 --> 40:40.056
who would have had all of these
supporters calling for his freedom,

40:40.156 --> 40:44.095
instead was treated as a...
was an immediate pariah.

40:44.195 --> 40:45.435
He was seen as a criminal.

40:45.555 --> 40:49.575
So there's a lot of... circumstantial...

40:49.675 --> 40:51.855
evidence, if you want to call it that.

40:51.955 --> 40:54.775
There's a lot of technical bits
and pieces involved.

40:54.875 --> 40:56.815
It got really crazy in the middle of that.

40:56.915 --> 40:59.635
Sort of one thing is taking down
this online drug market.

40:59.755 --> 41:03.135
Another thing is pinning a number
of Murders-For-Hires on top of it.

41:03.235 --> 41:05.055
It just seems really, really far-fetched.

41:05.155 --> 41:08.775
The 29-year-old seemingly
clean-cut entrepreneur

41:08.875 --> 41:12.115
was living a secret life
as a digital drug lord.

41:12.235 --> 41:15.415
They're claiming that he's living
in a manner of a head of a cartel.

41:15.515 --> 41:18.235
The distinctions between Ross Ulbricht
and the head of a cartel,

41:18.355 --> 41:22.555
you don't have to see too many movies to
recognize what the differences are here.

41:22.835 --> 41:25.115
Then when the indictment finally came out,

41:25.235 --> 41:29.055
there were suddenly no charges around
these Murder-For-Hire accusations,

41:29.155 --> 41:33.295
only the drug trafficking and money
laundering and computer hacking.

41:33.395 --> 41:38.075
They had six charges. They used them
against him to deprive him of bail

41:38.195 --> 41:42.655
and yet two and a half months later...
the prosecutor didn't indict him.

41:42.755 --> 41:46.615
What they did instead was they
called it an "uncharged crime."

41:46.715 --> 41:49.135
Well, if something's a crime,
don't you charge someone for it?

41:49.235 --> 41:52.415
And if it's not a crime,
why is it there...

41:52.515 --> 41:54.835
Because it's prejudicial to a jury

41:54.955 --> 41:59.755
to have that sitting there unproven
just... just smearing him.

42:00.315 --> 42:05.135
The portrayal they want
is of someone who they could

42:05.235 --> 42:07.675
present to a jury
of not having redeeming value.

42:07.795 --> 42:10.775
It's a way of poisoning the atmosphere

42:10.875 --> 42:14.575
so that the jury doesn't focus
on the allegations,

42:14.675 --> 42:17.755
but focuses on this atmospheric
that the government has created

42:17.875 --> 42:20.955
that in some sense is a diversion
appealing to the emotional aspect of it

42:21.075 --> 42:25.335
so that if the proof is weak, the benefit
of the doubt doesn't go to the defendant,

42:25.435 --> 42:27.555
where it belongs,
under the presumption of innocence,

42:27.675 --> 42:31.295
but it goes to the government because there
are these awful things lurking out there

42:31.395 --> 42:32.955
which aren't part
of what we're supposed to find.

42:33.075 --> 42:34.875
The government doesn't have to
prove them beyond a reasonable doubt,

42:34.995 --> 42:36.615
but they've injected them in the case

42:36.715 --> 42:40.815
in a way that is toxic
to an impartial evaluation

42:40.915 --> 42:42.815
of what the evidence
is on the charged crimes.

42:42.915 --> 42:46.835
So people come in with a preconceived notion
and that's halfway there to guilt.

42:46.955 --> 42:51.615
Previously, the Murder-For-Hire was in there
as a charge and then it was dropped.

42:51.715 --> 42:53.335
But it's not gone away.

42:53.435 --> 42:56.115
It's included
as what they call an overt act

42:56.235 --> 42:59.635
in the conspiracy and to sell drugs.

42:59.755 --> 43:03.575
And so they actually made it
one of the things to support

43:03.675 --> 43:05.595
the larger drug conspiracy

43:05.755 --> 43:08.915
to either get a trial or get him to plead.

43:09.035 --> 43:12.235
It seemed like this bait and switch
that the government had accused him

43:12.355 --> 43:15.755
in this almost informal way of murder

43:15.875 --> 43:19.735
so that when he was charged with these
non-violent crimes in the end,

43:19.835 --> 43:22.255
he would still be seen
as a violent criminal.

43:22.355 --> 43:24.915
I think that that has
really been effective in...

43:25.035 --> 43:28.435
in coloring the portrait of Ross Ulbricht.

43:31.114 --> 43:32.854
Ever since Ross' arrest,

43:32.954 --> 43:36.714
he and his best friend Rene Pinnell
have remained in regular contact.

43:37.074 --> 43:39.874
Rene declined to give
substantive interviews to the press

43:39.994 --> 43:42.874
for fear they would be used
against Ross in court,

43:42.994 --> 43:46.994
but agreed to answer questions via email.

44:24.434 --> 44:28.114
<i># I'm a little teapot, short and stout #</i>

44:28.234 --> 44:31.694
<i># Here is my handle here is my spout #</i>

44:31.794 --> 44:35.214
<i># When I get all steamed up
hear me shout #</i>

44:35.314 --> 44:38.294
<i># Tip me over and pour me out #</i>

44:38.394 --> 44:40.234
Yay!

44:42.514 --> 44:44.474
Because of the severity of the charges,

44:44.594 --> 44:47.574
Ross was not able to grant
an interview from prison,

44:47.674 --> 44:51.574
which left only a scattering
of his personal photographs and movies.

44:51.674 --> 44:54.654
But from the exhaustive discussions
with friends and family

44:54.754 --> 44:57.214
and the public knowledge
of Ross's trajectory

44:57.314 --> 45:01.754
from Physics and Engineering major to running
a small home-spun book-selling company,

45:01.874 --> 45:05.514
it was difficult to understand how he could
possibly have been the sole mastermind

45:05.634 --> 45:08.914
of the Silk Road,
a vast and complex Internet service

45:09.034 --> 45:11.994
with over a million users worldwide.

45:12.114 --> 45:14.574
Ross was certainly bright
and studious with a deep interest

45:14.674 --> 45:18.674
in libertarian economic theory, which
clearly echoed the mandate and philosophy

45:18.794 --> 45:21.434
of many of the posts
of the Dread Pirate Roberts.

45:21.554 --> 45:24.474
But he had no experience whatsoever
in computer coding

45:24.594 --> 45:26.774
or scaling large Internet companies.

45:26.874 --> 45:29.614
So how did Ross connect
to what little is truly known

45:29.714 --> 45:31.794
about the Dread Pirate Roberts?

45:32.274 --> 45:35.274
DPR was motivated
by a pacifistic philosophy

45:35.474 --> 45:39.934
and an agenda of creating victimless
exchange and reduced harm in the drug trade.

45:40.034 --> 45:44.314
This ethos would be embraced by the chief
architects and vendors of the Silk Road

45:44.434 --> 45:47.214
and reverberate
through the entire community.

45:47.314 --> 45:49.734
[There were quite a few people
that I didn't sell to]

45:49.834 --> 45:55.234
[just because I could tell that they were
obviously not mature enough to handle]

45:55.354 --> 46:00.274
[using these drugs, and didn't know enough.
It was like "Go read first...]

46:00.394 --> 46:05.134
["go figure it out and then come back
to me and I'll sell you something"]

46:05.234 --> 46:09.394
["but I'm not gonna pop your cherry
and kill you, potentially."]

46:09.514 --> 46:13.954
[The heroin in particular I was very careful
about who I sold it to because...]

46:14.594 --> 46:19.113
[it was not stepped on.
It was the best heroin on Silk Road.]

46:19.673 --> 46:22.133
The Silk Road appeared to be
a successful experiment

46:22.233 --> 46:24.213
in creating a pacifistic community,

46:24.313 --> 46:27.433
overseen by a figurehead
with a deep-rooted ideology.

46:27.713 --> 46:30.173
But these core ideals
of the Dread Pirate Roberts

46:30.273 --> 46:33.193
were completely at odds
with the Murder-For-Hire allegations.

46:33.473 --> 46:35.133
Did DPR become corrupted

46:35.233 --> 46:39.513
and turn his back on the mandate
of non-violence and harm reduction?

46:39.633 --> 46:42.253
Were there other people
using the DPR account

46:42.353 --> 46:44.673
who were responsible for these actions?

46:44.873 --> 46:46.613
Or was there some other truth

46:46.713 --> 46:51.633
behind these alleged murder hits
that produced no victims?

46:58.513 --> 47:00.793
We don't know the first piece of evidence

47:00.913 --> 47:05.173
that lead the feds down
this chain of investigation

47:05.273 --> 47:10.133
to the San Francisco library
where Ross Ulbricht was arrested.

47:10.233 --> 47:13.533
All we know is that at some point
they located the Silk Road servers

47:13.633 --> 47:16.893
in a data center in Iceland
and imaged them.

47:16.993 --> 47:20.793
They copied all the data
off of them, and seized them...

47:20.913 --> 47:22.833
but we don't know
how they found those servers.

47:22.953 --> 47:26.673
The whole idea of the Silk Road was
that it ran as a Tor-hidden service,

47:26.793 --> 47:29.533
which means that Tor
protected its physical location

47:29.633 --> 47:33.053
and made it very difficult
to locate the computers that ran it.

47:33.153 --> 47:38.973
So the mystery of how the FBI,
or the DEA, or possibly the NSA,

47:39.073 --> 47:41.613
located those servers is still unsolved

47:41.713 --> 47:45.133
and, in fact, hasn't been mentioned
in any of the legal documents

47:45.233 --> 47:47.773
surrounding Ross Ulbricht's trial.

47:47.873 --> 47:50.173
I think his defense
has seized on this as...

47:50.273 --> 47:52.853
something that the government
doesn't want to talk about.

47:52.953 --> 47:58.173
And if that's the case, then it does raise
these Fourth Amendment issues

47:58.273 --> 48:01.913
of can the government use
essentially hacking techniques

48:02.033 --> 48:05.133
to dig up evidence on a criminal suspect?

48:05.233 --> 48:07.573
And if so, what kinds
of warrant do they need?

48:07.673 --> 48:10.333
If in fact there was some kind
of violation of the Fourth Amendment,

48:10.433 --> 48:13.573
in that initial part of the investigation,

48:13.673 --> 48:17.753
that really was the first clue
that lead them down this entire chain

48:17.873 --> 48:19.213
to the arrest of Ross Ulbricht,

48:19.313 --> 48:21.693
it could be a giant problem
for the prosecution

48:21.793 --> 48:26.433
that then taints every other piece
of evidence that they found subsequently.

48:27.313 --> 48:29.353
The government has prosecuted
other people for doing

48:29.473 --> 48:33.233
essentially what the government
did here, which is...

48:35.153 --> 48:39.253
trying to get underneath
the public face of a website.

48:39.353 --> 48:41.853
And they have alleged
that getting that information

48:41.953 --> 48:43.773
that's not supposed
to be publicly accessible

48:43.873 --> 48:48.333
by sophisticated computer,
inquiries or activities,

48:48.433 --> 48:52.133
that that is a violation of federal law.

48:52.233 --> 48:54.573
So here's... and that's why they always say,
we didn't do anything wrong,

48:54.673 --> 48:57.893
we didn't do anything in violation,
but they really know what's at stake here,

48:57.993 --> 49:00.653
because they've actually
prosecuted people for the same thing.

49:00.753 --> 49:04.052
And the government's affidavit,
the affidavit from Agent Tarbell

49:04.152 --> 49:06.432
about how they got
to the Silk Road servers

49:06.552 --> 49:11.152
has been met with incredulousness
by the Internet community.

49:11.552 --> 49:14.292
The Tarbell declaration,
to put it politely,

49:14.392 --> 49:17.392
seems vaguely disconnected from the truth.

49:17.512 --> 49:20.252
If you, depending on which
security expert you ask,

49:20.352 --> 49:25.612
you will get it's vaguely disconnected
to the truth to something filled with...

49:25.712 --> 49:28.412
it is a massive pile of bovine excrement.

49:28.512 --> 49:32.372
What Tarbell's story was is he was
typing away at his computer,

49:32.472 --> 49:37.392
visiting the Silk Road website and the
CAPTCHA was transmitted in the clear,

49:37.512 --> 49:41.972
and he somehow saw the IP packets
go directly to the server.

49:42.072 --> 49:44.892
And so he then connects to that server
and gets the CAPTCHA.

49:44.992 --> 49:47.632
Game over, they found the backend server.

49:47.752 --> 49:53.912
Unfortunately, this was playing fast
and loose with the truth.

49:54.032 --> 49:57.512
Because the logs provided to the defense

49:57.632 --> 50:02.812
show that what Tarbell found
was not the CAPTCHA image,

50:02.912 --> 50:05.652
but instead a php MyAdmin page.

50:05.752 --> 50:10.172
The server was running some stuff
over the clear, but not the CAPTCHA.

50:10.272 --> 50:15.632
So Tarbell's story doesn't mesh
with the FBI's own evidence.

50:16.312 --> 50:20.332
They hacked the servers and with that access
could essentially do whatever they wanted.

50:20.432 --> 50:23.472
Given just the institutional pressure
to take this thing down,

50:23.592 --> 50:26.112
it's naive to think that they didn't.

50:28.032 --> 50:30.392
Of course, it's on the table
that this is how they discovered him.

50:30.512 --> 50:32.952
He was dealing with Tor.
He was dealing with all these technologies

50:33.072 --> 50:35.572
which we know are the subject
of NSA investigations,

50:35.672 --> 50:37.132
as revealed by Edward Snowden.

50:37.232 --> 50:39.952
It's at least reasonable to assume
that there's been this kind

50:40.072 --> 50:43.372
of parallel construction or interference
or like not playing by the rules

50:43.472 --> 50:45.052
that the state deals out
for you to play with.

50:45.152 --> 50:48.472
But then again,
we all know that it deals the cards.

50:48.592 --> 50:50.952
It runs the game anyway. It's not even...

50:51.072 --> 50:54.772
It's naive to think that
this wasn't an available option.

50:54.872 --> 51:00.032
The issue is whether the agent
could have done what he said he did.

51:00.152 --> 51:02.932
The theory that's been
brought forward in a testimony

51:03.032 --> 51:05.432
by the individual agents that did it,

51:05.552 --> 51:08.572
they were able to manipulate
part of the server

51:08.672 --> 51:12.492
to cough up an address
that shouldn't have been given up

51:12.592 --> 51:14.772
and that address came back to Iceland.

51:14.872 --> 51:19.192
And that server there was hosting
the Silk Road hidden service.

51:19.952 --> 51:22.332
I think we're not gonna know
till we go to trial

51:22.432 --> 51:24.112
and we may never know for sure.

51:24.232 --> 51:27.012
There's always this balance of...

51:27.112 --> 51:29.772
trying to be forward leaning
in your investigative techniques

51:29.872 --> 51:32.752
and making sure that you don't
trample on rights at the same time.

51:32.872 --> 51:36.412
You wanna stay well within the bounds
of your legal authority,

51:36.512 --> 51:40.852
because if you step over the line,
the evidence is gonna be tossed.

51:40.952 --> 51:44.112
It's not gonna be admissible in court
and you may wind up

51:44.232 --> 51:46.772
jeopardizing the outcome
of an entire investigation.

51:46.872 --> 51:49.011
And so I think what agencies
will try and do is...

51:49.111 --> 51:50.931
they'll want to step right up to the line,

51:51.031 --> 51:54.871
and maybe get a little bit of chalk
on their toes, but don't step over it.

51:54.991 --> 51:58.991
Ross' lawyer made a motion to dismiss
the case based on the disputed seizure

51:59.111 --> 52:02.971
of the Silk Road servers,
arguing that admitting this material

52:03.071 --> 52:06.251
not only violates his client's
Fourth Amendment rights,

52:06.351 --> 52:10.551
but would set a dangerous precedent
for the rights to privacy of all citizens.

52:11.191 --> 52:14.251
The judge, Katherine Forest,
sided with the prosecution

52:14.351 --> 52:17.231
stating that the Tarbell declaration
was acceptable.

52:17.511 --> 52:19.951
And the motion was denied.

52:24.991 --> 52:28.591
Search and seizure law
in the digital age is really...

52:28.711 --> 52:32.331
doesn't have the limitations on it that...

52:32.431 --> 52:34.171
it does in the physical space.

52:34.271 --> 52:38.011
And we see it not only
in the search and seizure laws,

52:38.111 --> 52:41.491
like what is the standard upon which they
can come and grab your computer?

52:41.591 --> 52:44.651
What kind of searches can they do
on your computer once they have it?

52:44.751 --> 52:46.991
Do they just get everything?
We see this at the border.

52:47.111 --> 52:48.651
Or we see this at searches into arrests.

52:48.751 --> 52:53.111
People now carry around smart phones
that have their whole lives in them.

52:53.231 --> 52:57.251
And if they get stopped,
law enforcement is certainly right now

52:57.351 --> 53:00.531
in a lot of places taking the position
that absolutely anything that's connected,

53:00.631 --> 53:04.731
that's on that device,
including logging into your accounts

53:04.831 --> 53:07.991
that you can log into from
that device, is fair game.

53:08.111 --> 53:12.011
If the prosecution gets away
with this warrantless seizure

53:12.111 --> 53:15.731
of Americans' data as well as
all these other foreigners,

53:15.831 --> 53:17.951
it could have a lasting precedent

53:18.071 --> 53:20.651
for how the Fourth Amendment
works in the digital age.

53:20.751 --> 53:25.211
I think that that, in fact, may be the
most lasting effect of the Silk Road.

53:25.311 --> 53:28.891
Generally, what happens
in the criminal law field

53:28.991 --> 53:33.451
is that there's some case
of major proportion

53:33.551 --> 53:36.851
that is used as a means of changing rules,

53:36.951 --> 53:40.691
or expanding exceptions
to constitutional protections,

53:40.791 --> 53:42.891
and once it's there,
once the precedent is set,

53:42.991 --> 53:45.131
it then trickles down
very quickly and very easily

53:45.231 --> 53:48.951
into all sorts of ordinary cases where,
you know, the ends justify the means.

53:49.071 --> 53:51.811
Then all of a sudden, it's now spread.

53:51.911 --> 53:55.631
The average citizen may say, "Well,
why is this important to me? Why do I care?

53:55.751 --> 53:58.991
"I'm not buying drugs on the network. Nobody
I know is buying drugs on the network,"

53:59.111 --> 54:00.331
but it's not just about that.

54:00.431 --> 54:04.831
We're a democracy and informed citizens...

54:05.551 --> 54:07.631
understand they have a right to privacy

54:07.751 --> 54:12.571
and that the Fourth Amendment protects
against unreasonable searches and seizures.

54:12.671 --> 54:14.331
Information has to be encrypted.

54:14.431 --> 54:18.231
And that goes from a large corporation
down to an individual.

54:18.351 --> 54:23.291
And so for those who are arguing that
information should not be encrypted,

54:23.391 --> 54:28.471
certainly that makes it easier
for law enforcement to... combat,

54:28.591 --> 54:32.131
but it also makes it easier
for the cyber criminals to attack.

54:32.231 --> 54:35.410
It makes total sense that criminals
are among the early wave,

54:35.510 --> 54:38.830
along with the sort of paranoid people,
of these new tools and services.

54:38.950 --> 54:41.710
But that doesn't mean that they're
the only people using these services.

54:41.830 --> 54:43.890
There are a hell of a lot
of journalists that I know

54:43.990 --> 54:46.390
and regularly communicate
with now over Tor.

54:46.510 --> 54:49.890
But you know, for the people
who oppose this technology,

54:49.990 --> 54:52.630
who see it as a threat,
the fact that criminals use it

54:52.750 --> 54:55.250
is a great way to demonize it.

54:55.350 --> 54:57.430
I definitely do believe
that there are people in the US

54:57.550 --> 54:59.890
that don't think that the government
is doing anything wrong.

54:59.990 --> 55:03.530
It's not necessarily something that you're
concerned with or that you care too much about

55:03.630 --> 55:07.250
or that you're really passionate about until
you're standing right in the middle of it.

55:07.350 --> 55:11.410
And it's something more dangerous
than any website could ever be

55:11.510 --> 55:14.570
is what our government has become
and how they operate.

55:14.670 --> 55:17.910
This goes back to that question of the
government kind of trying to treat the Internet

55:18.030 --> 55:23.070
differently without following
the same kind of judicial processes.

55:23.190 --> 55:26.110
Well, the Supreme Court has proven
that they do not agree.

55:26.350 --> 55:31.030
You know, recently with Riley vs California
with an illegal search of a cell phone.

55:31.430 --> 55:36.730
Precedent can be set that will limit
their ability to infringe on our rights.

55:36.830 --> 55:41.370
Someone asked how
her political views have shifted.

55:41.470 --> 55:45.170
Because suddenly she's standing
right in the middle of Tor,

55:45.270 --> 55:50.290
Bitcoin, the war on drugs,
online anonymity, encryption.

55:50.390 --> 55:53.690
And she's had a... she's had
to learn a lot of different things,

55:53.790 --> 55:57.370
and also not only
just the whole legal system but...

55:57.470 --> 56:00.590
everything around
the technology and the case.

56:02.510 --> 56:06.610
After over a year in prison,
Ross delayed the trial two months,

56:06.710 --> 56:10.050
stating that important discovery evidence
he needed to examine

56:10.150 --> 56:13.350
had only just been delivered
to him by the prosecution.

56:13.950 --> 56:16.770
The FBI shut down what it calls
the most sophisticated

56:16.870 --> 56:19.730
and extensive criminal marketplace
on the Internet,

56:19.830 --> 56:22.270
but it may be finding new life.

56:22.430 --> 56:25.610
The arrest of Ross Ulbricht
and closure of the Silk Road

56:25.710 --> 56:28.690
did nothing to hamper
drug sales on the dark net.

56:28.790 --> 56:30.970
Many new markets immediately appeared,

56:31.070 --> 56:33.970
including a re-launch
of the Silk Road itself,

56:34.070 --> 56:38.010
also run by someone calling themselves
the Dread Pirate Roberts.

56:38.110 --> 56:41.790
And like its predecessor, the second
Silk Road also claimed a mandate

56:41.910 --> 56:45.370
of reducing violence and harm
in drug transactions.

56:45.470 --> 56:50.390
The Dread Pirate tweets, "Silk Road while
under my watch will never harm a soul.

56:50.510 --> 56:53.970
If we did, then we are no better
than the thugs on the street."

56:54.070 --> 56:58.390
The new Dread Pirate Roberts told me
that he knows he can't be around forever,

56:58.510 --> 57:01.490
and when he's gone, someone else...

57:01.590 --> 57:04.210
he's confident someone else
will step up and fill the void.

57:04.310 --> 57:07.530
You can take down the man,
but you can't take down the idea.

57:07.630 --> 57:11.770
By this time, statistics appeared
claiming the first Silk Road had succeeded

57:11.870 --> 57:15.870
in its mission of reducing
violence in the drug trade.

57:21.789 --> 57:24.989
While I was with the Baltimore
Police Department in the early 2000s,

57:25.109 --> 57:30.109
I had two city officers in uniform
killed by drug dealers on the street.

57:30.509 --> 57:34.889
And there was a family of seven,
the Dawson family on Preston Street,

57:34.989 --> 57:39.789
they were killed by one drug dealer in
one night, mother, father and five kids.

57:41.549 --> 57:45.609
And so as the years in the early
2000s start moving along,

57:45.709 --> 57:49.869
I'm continuing to think about this
from a place of violence

57:50.229 --> 57:53.589
and beginning to realize that
our policies of drug prohibition

57:53.709 --> 57:56.489
were actually counterproductive
to public safety.

57:56.589 --> 57:59.989
The one thing that I signed on
for to improve,

58:00.109 --> 58:03.889
to better public safety in our
neighborhoods, was making it worse.

58:03.989 --> 58:06.989
And... I found

58:07.109 --> 58:11.989
a large number of police officers and judges
and criminal prosecutors and...

58:12.109 --> 58:16.629
DEA agents and FBI who think the same way.

58:16.749 --> 58:20.369
If Baltimore moved
from street corners to online services,

58:20.469 --> 58:22.409
oh, my God, do you know
how many shootings,

58:22.509 --> 58:26.729
how many fewer shootings we would have
every year, which equate to fewer homicides?

58:26.829 --> 58:30.109
Number one, it removes the... the buyer...

58:30.709 --> 58:33.389
from the back alleys
and from the street corners

58:33.509 --> 58:36.949
and from those dangerous places
of dealing with the seller.

58:37.069 --> 58:39.449
Buying it over the Internet
where it's delivered to you,

58:39.549 --> 58:41.209
removes you from that scenario.

58:41.309 --> 58:44.749
One of the interesting things
that having an online market does

58:44.869 --> 58:47.569
is that it makes sellers
much more accountable to buyers.

58:47.669 --> 58:50.509
And one of the really interesting innovations
is the whole review system,

58:50.829 --> 58:54.049
where buyers can review
the sellers and the items

58:54.149 --> 58:58.009
that they bought from these
on these market places.

58:58.109 --> 59:02.249
And what that does is it makes sellers
more accountable and it lets buyers...

59:02.349 --> 59:05.809
it gives buyers a way
to assess both the quality,

59:05.909 --> 59:08.529
the purity and the potency
of the drugs they're getting.

59:08.629 --> 59:12.389
It makes these transactions
much more safe for the buyers.

59:12.869 --> 59:16.849
But we're shutting them down,
attempting to shut them down,

59:16.949 --> 59:19.069
because we will never shut them down.

59:20.029 --> 59:23.349
We've been at this drug war now
for over four decades,

59:23.469 --> 59:24.909
and what has happened since then?

59:25.029 --> 59:29.309
At the beginning, it was just the cartels
and organized crime making a ton of money.

59:29.589 --> 59:34.089
Today, they make globally
$322 billion off this industry.

59:34.189 --> 59:36.649
Corporate America's also now in the game.

59:36.749 --> 59:40.629
Private prisons, okay?
Corrections Corporation of America.

59:40.749 --> 59:46.089
About a year ago they gave out $675 million
in dividends to the shareholders.

59:46.189 --> 59:50.509
Drug testing companies. It's now become
a multi-billion-dollar industry.

59:50.789 --> 59:52.269
And who gets tested?

59:52.389 --> 59:56.689
Those who are in prison or under the
control of our criminal justice programs...

59:56.789 --> 59:58.109
on parole and probation.

59:58.229 --> 01:00:00.249
So corporate America's
making a lot of money.

01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:03.469
What about law enforcement?
Law enforcement's making a ton of money.

01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:05.768
The government's 1033 Program, you know,

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:09.048
where we get armored vehicles
and machine guns

01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:12.668
and whatever we want
of the surplus military equipment...

01:00:12.788 --> 01:00:14.168
that's because of the drug war.

01:00:14.268 --> 01:00:16.468
Over the years we've seen these...

01:00:16.588 --> 01:00:19.848
these huge bureaucracies
build up around the drug war,

01:00:19.948 --> 01:00:22.808
around prosecuting the drug war.
You've got the Drug Enforcement Agency.

01:00:22.908 --> 01:00:25.528
You've got the Office
of National Drug Control Policy.

01:00:25.628 --> 01:00:29.948
So a lot of the opposition is just
rooted in self interest

01:00:30.068 --> 01:00:33.168
among places like the FBI and the DEA,

01:00:33.268 --> 01:00:36.508
where if you're telling somebody
who's been in the FBI for 30 years

01:00:36.628 --> 01:00:40.488
that drugs are no longer a priority,
that's an existential threat to them.

01:00:40.588 --> 01:00:43.008
That kind of takes away
their whole reason for existence.

01:00:43.108 --> 01:00:47.248
You really have to think about
the danger of some of these drugs,

01:00:47.348 --> 01:00:50.808
the severe danger of addiction,

01:00:50.908 --> 01:00:53.808
the havoc that it, you know,
that it reaps on families

01:00:53.908 --> 01:00:57.668
and, you know,
and children, and... careers.

01:00:57.788 --> 01:01:01.168
And so to say that, you know,
we need to step back and liberalize,

01:01:01.268 --> 01:01:04.368
well, but you... that's one
approach you can take,

01:01:04.468 --> 01:01:06.348
but then you've got to look
at a cause and effect.

01:01:06.468 --> 01:01:10.468
If we do this, what are the second
and third order effects?

01:01:13.348 --> 01:01:15.428
The FBI, our federal government,
they're gonna go in

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:19.328
and they're shutting these places down.
But you know what? New ones just open up.

01:01:19.428 --> 01:01:21.128
'Cause there's so much money to be made.

01:01:21.228 --> 01:01:25.828
They'll continue to open up,
and it's just a dog chasing its tail.

01:01:35.308 --> 01:01:39.068
We're a team, and we've been working
on this thing together right from the start.

01:01:40.668 --> 01:01:45.328
The way it's affected me is in some ways
very much the same as it affects Lyn,

01:01:45.428 --> 01:01:48.468
but I don't have to go out there
and talk to reporters.

01:01:48.588 --> 01:01:51.508
And we've... we've kind
of set it up that way.

01:01:51.628 --> 01:01:55.688
It's hard enough having your...
your loved one in prison,

01:01:55.788 --> 01:02:00.128
but then the whole media thing is,
it definitely adds pressure.

01:02:00.228 --> 01:02:03.288
I've known for a long time that the media

01:02:03.388 --> 01:02:07.788
wasn't reporting the whole story,
that it was skewed.

01:02:08.188 --> 01:02:14.188
I see what Lyn and I are doing
as a... as a pushback to that.

01:02:15.988 --> 01:02:20.108
Ross has been in there a year
and he's avoided all violence,

01:02:20.228 --> 01:02:22.728
even though it's been around him.

01:02:22.828 --> 01:02:25.588
That has matured him for sure.

01:02:26.188 --> 01:02:31.308
The fact that he's come out of this
unscathed so far, speaks volumes.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.508
He seems serious.
You know, there's a lot at stake.

01:02:35.628 --> 01:02:39.428
He's... feeling good
that we got the extension.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:42.228
He had this mountain
of stuff to go through

01:02:42.348 --> 01:02:45.548
and I felt like he was
running out the clock.

01:02:45.788 --> 01:02:48.788
And now they have that extra
two months has made...

01:02:48.908 --> 01:02:51.407
has been "essential" is the word he used.

01:02:51.507 --> 01:02:53.967
And so I think he feels that, you know,

01:02:54.067 --> 01:02:57.187
he's much more prepared and ready.

01:02:57.387 --> 01:03:01.827
Yeah, he says he's ready for trial.
He's ready to go in there and win.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:07.147
I have also matured in this last year.

01:03:07.267 --> 01:03:12.067
Matured in my thinking
about ethics, politics.

01:03:12.587 --> 01:03:17.747
When I became more and more aware
of what the drug war was doing,

01:03:17.867 --> 01:03:19.527
the tragedy.

01:03:19.627 --> 01:03:23.627
So many people have been
victimized by the drug war.

01:03:23.747 --> 01:03:27.987
It's a giant mess
and it's a story that needs telling.

01:03:28.107 --> 01:03:32.787
And we've got a pulpit,
in a way, to tell it from.

01:03:32.907 --> 01:03:36.407
It's so weird to be doing
all this and it's...

01:03:36.507 --> 01:03:38.727
distracting and it's challenging

01:03:38.827 --> 01:03:41.767
and you wanna do the right thing,
and then it's all about Ross.

01:03:41.867 --> 01:03:44.887
And then we go and we see him
and hug him and talk to him

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:48.207
and hold his hand
and it's just like Ross, you know?

01:03:48.307 --> 01:03:52.307
It's such a disconnect, and...
it's just so hard to see him in there.

01:03:58.227 --> 01:04:01.687
Being in the prison, visiting,
it's a very emotional experience,

01:04:01.787 --> 01:04:05.127
because there are all these families there

01:04:05.227 --> 01:04:09.007
and they get to see
their loved one one hour a week.

01:04:09.107 --> 01:04:11.407
And so they're soaking each other up.

01:04:11.507 --> 01:04:14.407
And you're in a room of 150 people,

01:04:14.507 --> 01:04:16.967
sitting side-by-side, tight-packed.

01:04:17.067 --> 01:04:20.627
And... there's just all this emotion

01:04:20.747 --> 01:04:23.067
saturating the atmosphere.

01:04:34.427 --> 01:04:37.907
The prisoners have segregated themselves.

01:04:38.587 --> 01:04:42.027
But as loved ones coming to visit...

01:04:42.147 --> 01:04:46.747
there's no sense of, segregation...
race at all.

01:04:47.827 --> 01:04:52.227
We're just 150 people
whose hearts are breaking.

01:05:07.747 --> 01:05:10.607
Of all the Snowden disclosures
that have come out to date,

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:13.487
the one that will have
the greatest long-term impact

01:05:13.587 --> 01:05:16.727
is the revelation that the NSA
has been subverting

01:05:16.827 --> 01:05:19.787
cryptographic standards and making
the Internet less secure.

01:05:20.147 --> 01:05:22.107
That disclosure, those articles,

01:05:22.227 --> 01:05:25.487
have radicalized
a new generation of cryptographers,

01:05:25.587 --> 01:05:27.567
a new generation of computer scientists

01:05:27.667 --> 01:05:30.927
who are now intent
upon building tools and services

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:34.307
that can withstand pervasive
government surveillance.

01:05:34.507 --> 01:05:38.246
Did you see our wireless
from Barclay's Bank?

01:05:38.346 --> 01:05:40.786
They like Bitcoin,
so they're supporting our work.

01:05:40.906 --> 01:05:44.986
They're providing us
with free Wi-Fi from the bank.

01:05:47.106 --> 01:05:49.266
In the fall of 2014,

01:05:49.386 --> 01:05:51.606
as Ross was preparing for his trial,

01:05:51.706 --> 01:05:54.066
a group of hackers,
programmers and activists

01:05:54.186 --> 01:05:56.826
met in a squat in the center of London.

01:05:57.066 --> 01:06:00.326
This gathering represented
the next wave of the dark net,

01:06:00.426 --> 01:06:03.246
developing new and evolved
cryptographic tools

01:06:03.346 --> 01:06:05.966
that would not be so easily shut down.

01:06:06.066 --> 01:06:07.946
Open source is incredibly powerful.

01:06:08.066 --> 01:06:11.566
Open source is responsible
for WikiLeaks, Wikipedia, Linux,

01:06:11.666 --> 01:06:16.446
which runs all of our infrastructure,
for Firefox, for Bit Torrent,

01:06:16.546 --> 01:06:19.666
for Bitcoin, for all of these...
for encryption,

01:06:19.786 --> 01:06:23.306
for all of these real uses
of tech... not the yuppie...

01:06:23.426 --> 01:06:26.726
Angry Birds or silly apps that...

01:06:26.826 --> 01:06:28.426
these people, make, you know?

01:06:28.546 --> 01:06:33.206
Open source is also an example
of how we can organize economically,

01:06:33.306 --> 01:06:36.806
an example for the future,
to build the products we need

01:06:36.906 --> 01:06:39.506
without needing proprietary industry,

01:06:39.626 --> 01:06:42.326
without needing the points of control,

01:06:42.426 --> 01:06:46.706
without needing masters
and slaves and babysitters.

01:06:47.226 --> 01:06:51.086
It's not enough to build
privacy-preserving tools.

01:06:51.186 --> 01:06:54.646
It's not enough to write
revolutionary research papers

01:06:54.746 --> 01:06:58.066
and design amazing
cryptographic primitives.

01:06:58.186 --> 01:07:00.806
You have to get them
into the hands of the users.

01:07:00.906 --> 01:07:03.946
And I think in the future
what you'll find is that...

01:07:04.066 --> 01:07:08.446
tools like Tor, tools like OTR,
like PGP, like Bitcoin

01:07:08.546 --> 01:07:11.326
will be built into the services
and applications that you use

01:07:11.426 --> 01:07:13.966
and you won't know they're there.

01:07:14.066 --> 01:07:18.326
We want to empower the individual,
protect the small guy.

01:07:18.426 --> 01:07:21.046
We have a mistrust of central authority.

01:07:21.146 --> 01:07:23.346
We believe in freedom of information.

01:07:23.466 --> 01:07:27.766
First of all, we have the centralized
drug marketplace, Silk Road.

01:07:27.866 --> 01:07:30.026
Governments went in and shut that down.

01:07:30.226 --> 01:07:33.606
And then up sprouted dozens of different,

01:07:33.706 --> 01:07:35.786
centralized drug markets.

01:07:35.906 --> 01:07:39.846
And in a game of whack a mole,
they shut down one and now there's dozens.

01:07:39.946 --> 01:07:42.986
And now we're entering the realm
of decentralized drug markets,

01:07:43.106 --> 01:07:45.966
with no central operator,
no central point of control.

01:07:46.066 --> 01:07:47.586
What are they gonna do?

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:52.366
They're gonna continue
to do these kinds of things,

01:07:52.466 --> 01:07:54.586
and even if it's a distributed network,

01:07:54.906 --> 01:07:58.126
peer-to-peer is worked continuously by

01:07:58.226 --> 01:08:00.186
the... state and local
law enforcement agencies.

01:08:00.506 --> 01:08:03.066
And they arrest people every week.

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:06.346
On November 6, 2014,

01:08:06.466 --> 01:08:08.586
law enforcement agencies around the world

01:08:08.706 --> 01:08:12.006
launched a coordinated effort
called "Operation Onymous,"

01:08:12.106 --> 01:08:16.406
seizing hundreds of dark net sites,
including the re-launch of the Silk Road.

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:19.265
Bruce Schneier, the cryptographer,
once said to me,

01:08:19.626 --> 01:08:22.245
"You know, in this cat and mouse game,
the mice will win in the end,

01:08:22.345 --> 01:08:26.984
but the cats will be well fed."
I think that that's the way to see it.

01:08:27.944 --> 01:08:30.444
This game is going to continue forever.

01:08:30.545 --> 01:08:33.665
[They're always reacting to us...]

01:08:36.465 --> 01:08:37.325
[which is fine.]

01:08:37.425 --> 01:08:39.645
[But once they're reacted
and they've shored up]

01:08:39.745 --> 01:08:43.564
[and they've figured out "this is the new
defenses, you're not getting past this one."]

01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:46.205
[We're just gonna sit there
and pick at it and get around it again]

01:08:46.305 --> 01:08:49.625
[We're always gonna win.
We're always gonna win.]

01:08:50.145 --> 01:08:51.925
There's a reason the Silk Road
was so powerful.

01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:54.785
And I know the cryptos now are writing
the kind of automatic Silk Road,

01:08:54.904 --> 01:08:55.984
and Amir helped do this.

01:08:56.104 --> 01:08:59.425
This is now the peer-to-peer model where
there's no one individual administrator.

01:08:59.785 --> 01:09:03.024
And seeing that as the weak point,
technically speaking, this is all correct.

01:09:03.145 --> 01:09:05.425
But there's something kind of...

01:09:05.545 --> 01:09:08.225
I don't want to make him a hero, like a...

01:09:09.225 --> 01:09:11.305
I don't want to say that he's a hero.
But you know...

01:09:11.425 --> 01:09:13.865
DPR recognized what was at stake

01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:17.685
and he was willing to do the things that most
of the libertarians weren't willing to do,

01:09:17.785 --> 01:09:19.925
because he was serious about...

01:09:20.024 --> 01:09:22.825
I think what the Silk Road meant.

01:09:24.024 --> 01:09:25.725
Three weeks before the trial,

01:09:25.825 --> 01:09:29.085
the issue of the Murders-For-Hire
suddenly resurfaced.

01:09:29.185 --> 01:09:32.165
The prosecution announced
that due to these allegations,

01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:36.564
they would not allow Ross's defense to know
the identities of their witnesses.

01:09:36.665 --> 01:09:39.404
The defense responded that using
these uncharged crimes

01:09:39.505 --> 01:09:41.265
in these manner was prejudicial.

01:09:42.225 --> 01:09:45.585
A hearing was called
to resolve the matter.

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:52.085
The judge ruled that some of the witnesses
won't be made available to the defense

01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:54.465
until right before the trial.

01:09:54.905 --> 01:09:59.025
It's based on her saying
that Ross might intimidate

01:09:59.145 --> 01:10:03.305
or even murder people... from jail.

01:10:11.945 --> 01:10:15.145
When all this first happened, I said,
well, it would still have been necessary

01:10:15.265 --> 01:10:19.025
to say that, well, this man's a murderer
and he was only out for his own gain.

01:10:19.145 --> 01:10:23.345
You know, he had... what do you call it,
a callous disregard for human life.

01:10:23.465 --> 01:10:26.425
It's necessary to paint a figure
that way rather than to make him...

01:10:26.545 --> 01:10:30.105
you know, a martyr of the war on drugs.
I think that's just good planning.

01:10:30.425 --> 01:10:33.865
I think it's gonna be difficult...
to have a fair trial.

01:10:33.985 --> 01:10:38.125
If you are innocent until proven guilty,
then with all the evidence

01:10:38.225 --> 01:10:41.805
and all the stories that have been written,
I think it's gonna be really difficult to...

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:48.065
to find people who are not influenced
by any of this at all going into it.

01:11:02.265 --> 01:11:05.925
The day before the trial,
Ross provided a written statement.

01:11:06.025 --> 01:11:10.024
It was the closest anyone would
ever get to an actual interview.

01:11:11.104 --> 01:11:16.704
[Throughout my adult life
I've tried to stay positive...]

01:11:19.544 --> 01:11:24.664
[and it's even more important
to do that now.]

01:11:27.304 --> 01:11:32.104
[I'm up against
a very powerful adversary.]

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:39.104
[You know, it's all too easy to think...]

01:11:42.384 --> 01:11:45.664
[that things are hopeless and to give up.]

01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:54.624
[But they're not.]

01:11:56.424 --> 01:11:59.344
[They're not hopeless.]

01:12:01.464 --> 01:12:04.064
[I'll never give up hope...]

01:12:06.184 --> 01:12:10.144
[of being free again.]

01:12:24.384 --> 01:12:27.324
Ross Ulbricht went on trial today.
A jury will decide a case that could impact

01:12:27.424 --> 01:12:29.584
- the future of Internet privacy.
- Good evening to you.

01:12:29.704 --> 01:12:33.324
Opening arguments taking place today,
and the first witness took the stand

01:12:33.424 --> 01:12:35.784
and actually just got off
a few minutes ago...

01:12:35.904 --> 01:12:39.184
A Homeland Security investigation
special agent

01:12:39.304 --> 01:12:43.904
who testified saying...
"Thousands of envelopes of drugs..."

01:12:46.104 --> 01:12:48.984
I think everyone was surprised
that Ross Ulbricht and his lawyers

01:12:49.104 --> 01:12:51.884
took this to trial in the first place
instead of just taking a plea deal

01:12:51.984 --> 01:12:55.124
like pretty much everyone expected.
And today, we saw why,

01:12:55.224 --> 01:12:59.364
which is that they've actually got a pretty
compelling alternate narrative

01:12:59.464 --> 01:13:01.904
of how this whole case has played out.

01:13:02.024 --> 01:13:06.104
The story that Dratel is telling
that Ross did create the Silk Road,

01:13:06.224 --> 01:13:08.044
which is an amazing admission
to begin with,

01:13:08.144 --> 01:13:12.264
and that the real operator of the Silk Road,
the Dread Pirate Roberts, framed him.

01:13:12.384 --> 01:13:15.884
It's a kind of theory
that I never heard posed before,

01:13:15.984 --> 01:13:19.984
that instead of Ross being the Dread
Pirate Roberts, he was framed by him.

01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:23.524
But in many ways, you know,
it's something I should've expected

01:13:23.624 --> 01:13:27.024
because it's what the Dread Pirate Roberts
told me when I interviewed him

01:13:27.144 --> 01:13:30.684
in July of 2013
that he didn't create the Silk Road,

01:13:30.784 --> 01:13:35.344
that he had inherited it from its creator,
kind of like a business acquisition.

01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:39.264
The FBI has told me that that
was Ross Ulbricht lying to me.

01:13:39.384 --> 01:13:43.064
If it is a lie, it would require
just a lot of foresight and planning,

01:13:43.184 --> 01:13:48.344
kind of like the... you know,
an amazing game of chess or something.

01:13:49.304 --> 01:13:52.804
In the first days of the trial,
the prosecution presented evidence

01:13:52.904 --> 01:13:57.603
that Ross kept a journal on his laptop
describing his involvement in the Silk Road

01:13:57.703 --> 01:14:01.363
and that the Bitcoins seized from his
laptop came directly from the site.

01:14:01.463 --> 01:14:04.523
While the defense would argue
that Ross abandoned the Silk Road

01:14:04.623 --> 01:14:09.583
after creating it and that the journal
and the Bitcoin were planted on his laptop.

01:14:09.703 --> 01:14:11.763
Andy, you interviewed
the Dread Pirate Roberts.

01:14:11.863 --> 01:14:15.803
What's the evidence connecting
Dread Pirate Roberts to Ulbricht directly?

01:14:15.903 --> 01:14:18.803
In the first couple of weeks
of this trial, which is ongoing now,

01:14:18.903 --> 01:14:21.543
we've seen that the prosecution
has a very strong case.

01:14:21.663 --> 01:14:24.203
Once they seized his laptop,
they found that he had kept a journal.

01:14:24.303 --> 01:14:26.983
If this is, in fact, Ulbricht's journal.
His defense claims it's not.

01:14:27.103 --> 01:14:29.643
He documented the administration
of this site for years.

01:14:29.743 --> 01:14:31.343
He has a log book of daily activities.

01:14:31.663 --> 01:14:34.303
So this is a really tight case
that's gonna be very difficult

01:14:34.423 --> 01:14:36.523
for Ulbricht to squeeze out of it.

01:14:36.623 --> 01:14:38.523
Underneath, in the deep web,

01:14:38.623 --> 01:14:42.683
we have an area where this young man,
according to the government,

01:14:42.783 --> 01:14:45.323
has made a decision that he's going to run

01:14:45.423 --> 01:14:49.923
an illegal drug empire
and we need to stop you,

01:14:50.023 --> 01:14:54.223
swift and certain prosecution,
and ultimate certain punishment.

01:14:55.463 --> 01:14:59.423
As the trial continued, Dratel planned
to reveal the government's own evidence

01:14:59.543 --> 01:15:03.623
showed they suspected multiple
people of running the Silk Road.

01:15:03.823 --> 01:15:07.183
During his cross examination
of DHS agent Der-Yeghiayan,

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:11.203
Dratel was able to expose that the agent
had long suspected another person

01:15:11.303 --> 01:15:13.263
to be the Dread Pirate Roberts,

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:16.303
going so far as to seek
a warrant for this suspect.

01:15:16.903 --> 01:15:19.843
The protection protested
this entire line of questioning

01:15:19.943 --> 01:15:21.683
on the grounds that it was hearsay.

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:25.383
The judge sided with the prosecution
and Dratel was no longer allowed

01:15:25.503 --> 01:15:28.563
to question government witnesses
about alternate suspects

01:15:28.663 --> 01:15:31.183
that came from
the government's own evidence.

01:15:31.303 --> 01:15:34.243
When the time came
for Dratel to begin his defense,

01:15:34.343 --> 01:15:36.163
he intended to use expert witnesses

01:15:36.263 --> 01:15:40.383
to explain that the complex technology
behind encryption and cryptocurrency

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:44.963
made it difficult to prove that the journal
and the Bitcoin belonged to Ross.

01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:47.323
The prosecution objected
to these witnesses,

01:15:47.423 --> 01:15:49.983
claiming they should have been
made known earlier in the trial

01:15:50.103 --> 01:15:53.643
and they were not necessary
for the jury's understanding of the case.

01:15:53.743 --> 01:15:56.303
Once again, the judge sided
with the prosecution,

01:15:56.423 --> 01:16:00.343
stating that this case did not require
specialized knowledge.

01:16:00.703 --> 01:16:03.123
Without expert witnesses
and unable to pursue

01:16:03.223 --> 01:16:05.923
the government's own evidence
of an alternate DPR,

01:16:06.023 --> 01:16:09.763
Dratel's entire defense
was effectively blocked.

01:16:09.863 --> 01:16:13.223
The trial ended abruptly the next day.

01:16:19.023 --> 01:16:23.183
The trial of Ross Ulbricht
raised more questions than it answered.

01:16:23.303 --> 01:16:27.643
Did we really know the full truth
of the Silk Road case?

01:16:27.743 --> 01:16:30.243
Would this case set a precedent
for the warrantless search

01:16:30.343 --> 01:16:32.723
of Americans' digital property?

01:16:32.823 --> 01:16:36.543
Whatever the ultimate outcome,
it was clear that the fall of the Silk Road

01:16:36.663 --> 01:16:39.462
was not the end of a chapter,
but the beginning.

01:16:39.782 --> 01:16:44.002
And the movement to create tools
and services for online privacy

01:16:44.102 --> 01:16:46.022
is stronger than ever.

01:16:46.142 --> 01:16:48.282
The trial of Silk Road
mastermind Ross Ulbricht

01:16:48.382 --> 01:16:51.362
concluded when a jury found him guilty
on seven different counts

01:16:51.462 --> 01:16:55.242
that included three drug charges as well
as computer hacking, money laundering

01:16:55.342 --> 01:16:59.182
and even a kingpin charge
of continuing a criminal enterprise.

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:01.922
Ulbricht faces a minimum
of 30 years behind bars,

01:17:02.022 --> 01:17:04.222
but his defense plans
to appeal this decision.

01:17:04.342 --> 01:17:06.242
Anyone here, all of us,

01:17:06.342 --> 01:17:10.262
are going to be judged by things for which
there is no attribution in real life.

01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:12.602
There's only attribution on the Internet

01:17:12.702 --> 01:17:16.682
for things to be created, codified,
edited, moved, hacked.

01:17:16.782 --> 01:17:19.382
- Was it a fair trial?
- No, I don't think so.

01:17:21.582 --> 01:17:25.882
As the actual verdict was read,
the word "guilty" was said seven times.

01:17:25.982 --> 01:17:29.802
Ross was just staring straight ahead.
I don't know what was on his face.

01:17:29.902 --> 01:17:32.522
But afterwards he turned back
to look at his family

01:17:32.622 --> 01:17:35.962
and he had this really heartbreaking
kind of stoic smile.

01:17:36.062 --> 01:17:39.542
And he was just... he wasn't crying,
but he was just blinking...

01:17:39.662 --> 01:17:41.922
like blinking hard.

01:17:42.022 --> 01:17:43.742
And...

01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:48.582
then as he was led away,
his mom said, "This is not the end."

01:17:49.262 --> 01:17:52.302
You know, that was it.

01:17:55.942 --> 01:17:58.782
The evidence against
Ulbricht was so powerful

01:17:58.902 --> 01:18:02.762
and Dratel's strategy had been to try
to cross examine every government witness

01:18:02.862 --> 01:18:06.182
and to pull out his alternative story
through that cross examination.

01:18:06.302 --> 01:18:08.782
And when the judge essentially
shut that down and said

01:18:08.902 --> 01:18:13.482
you have to limit your cross examination
to the scope of the government's...

01:18:13.582 --> 01:18:19.542
initial questioning, that really
prevented him from telling any other story.

01:18:22.662 --> 01:18:26.602
We have a much more informed perspective
than the rest of the world.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:31.242
We have meetings that we've had with Josh
through the last year and three months...

01:18:31.342 --> 01:18:32.582
regular meetings.

01:18:32.702 --> 01:18:37.342
We know about how he felt like he might
win the case, in cross examination.

01:18:38.022 --> 01:18:43.822
We know that the government, that his
witnesses were blocked from testifying.

01:18:44.862 --> 01:18:49.982
We were in the courtroom
and we saw what happened and the...

01:18:50.422 --> 01:18:54.142
the travesty, the... appalling,

01:18:54.702 --> 01:18:56.942
obstruction of justice that happened.

01:18:57.062 --> 01:19:01.662
There was 5,000 pages of government
evidence to do with one witness alone,

01:19:01.782 --> 01:19:05.082
Jarod Der-Yeghiayan.
None of that was allowed.

01:19:05.182 --> 01:19:08.822
5,000 pages, and it was dumped
on the defense 10 days before trial.

01:19:08.942 --> 01:19:14.022
Another 2,500 pages for other witnesses was
dumped on the defense a week before trial.

01:19:14.142 --> 01:19:18.862
And it was full of exculpatory evidence
favorable to Ross

01:19:18.982 --> 01:19:21.122
that was not permitted to be used.

01:19:21.222 --> 01:19:25.881
All this great, huge field of evidence

01:19:25.981 --> 01:19:31.101
that came out in the 3,500 material,
a week before trial, that was...

01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:34.081
that would help prove Ross's innocence

01:19:34.181 --> 01:19:38.481
was excluded from being
brought out in the courtroom.

01:19:38.581 --> 01:19:41.701
It would have been a whole different case.
This was the trial that didn't happen.

01:19:41.821 --> 01:19:44.261
- The trial that didn't happen.
- It just didn't happen because it was...

01:19:44.381 --> 01:19:49.421
only the prosecution's narrative
that we heard.

01:19:52.541 --> 01:19:54.941
So then what about the hacking
of the Silk Road servers?

01:19:55.061 --> 01:19:57.241
What about the precedent issue
of the case?

01:19:57.341 --> 01:20:01.741
We didn't get that far. We didn't get
to even have that kind of public hearing

01:20:01.861 --> 01:20:03.981
where the FBI has to say how they did it

01:20:04.101 --> 01:20:07.281
and then we get to decide
whether that was legal or illegal.

01:20:07.381 --> 01:20:10.341
That's maybe the most frustrating thing
about this case from a legal point of view

01:20:10.461 --> 01:20:15.241
is that American law enforcement
hacked a foreign server, I believe,

01:20:15.341 --> 01:20:17.721
and they didn't have a warrant

01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:21.561
and they completely got away
with it and nobody's even...

01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:24.761
nobody even gets to ask
any questions about it.

01:20:24.861 --> 01:20:27.921
- How is Ross through all of this?
- He's an amazing guy.

01:20:28.021 --> 01:20:31.141
You know, he's handling this
so much better than I would've.

01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:34.701
I don't know how I could've taken
what he's put up with

01:20:34.821 --> 01:20:38.581
and been subjected to
in this last year and three months.

01:20:38.861 --> 01:20:41.301
And we pray that...

01:20:41.861 --> 01:20:44.621
his spirit won't be crushed by this.

01:20:46.301 --> 01:20:48.221
It seems that Ross conceived
of the Silk Road,

01:20:48.341 --> 01:20:51.141
that he ran it for its
entire existence online.

01:20:51.261 --> 01:20:54.081
I actually accept that
the government has proven that.

01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:58.501
But Ross Ulbricht...
is a fascinating character.

01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:00.601
He invented this brilliant thing.

01:21:00.701 --> 01:21:03.161
He had principles.
He wasn't just a cyber-criminal.

01:21:03.261 --> 01:21:07.641
He wasn't just a drug lord or a kingpin
as he's described in these charges.

01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:10.121
He was also an idealistic guy.

01:21:10.221 --> 01:21:13.861
And I'm gonna be conflicted
about both the...

01:21:13.981 --> 01:21:16.581
kind of virtue of the Silk Road
and of Ross Ulbricht as a person,

01:21:16.701 --> 01:21:18.281
I think, for the rest of my life.

01:21:18.381 --> 01:21:21.301
I'm not gonna be able to come
to a conclusion about this.

01:21:23.621 --> 01:21:26.521
[On March 25th, 2015,
a criminal complaint was filed...]

01:21:26.621 --> 01:21:30.571
[against two former federal agents who
led the Silk Road task force in Baltimore.]

01:21:30.671 --> 01:21:34.301
[Among other charges, these agents allegedly
stole over a million dollars in Bitcoin...]

01:21:34.401 --> 01:21:37.761
[from the Silk Road and transferred them
to personal accounts.]

01:21:38.281 --> 01:21:41.841
[The government did not allow
Ulbricht's defense...]

01:21:41.941 --> 01:21:46.581
[to address this criminal investigation
during the trial.]

01:21:47.931 --> 01:21:51.171
[On May 29th, 2015, Ross Ulbricht
was sentenced to life in prison...]

01:21:51.291 --> 01:21:54.911
[without the possibility of parole.]

01:22:02.311 --> 01:22:04.791
I don't know. Got any more questions
or should we wrap it up?

01:22:04.911 --> 01:22:10.991
Yes. What are you going to do
over the next five years?

01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:13.511
In one sentence.

01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:28.510
I'm going to do a few things,
so one sentence isn't enough.

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:32.630
But, I wanna... I'm pretty sure I wanna
start a family in the next five years.

01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:34.430
Nice. Okay.

01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:36.430
And...

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:39.930
and... yeah, make more friends

01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:42.730
and close people I love.

01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:45.110
Yeah. Focus on...

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:48.630
being more connected to people.

01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:52.950
And... 20 years?

01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:56.110
20 years.

01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:00.450
I wanna have had a...

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:04.630
substantial, positive impact
on the future of humanity by that time.

01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:06.490
Do you think you're gonna live forever?

01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:08.670
I think it's a possibility.

01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:12.830
I honestly do. I think I might
live forever in some form

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:16.430
by that time with technologies
changing so fast.

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:20.150
Cool. I hope I'm going there.

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.550
Sweet.

01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:28.830
[Someday, we could be a shining beacon of
hope for the oppressed people of the world]

01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:33.350
[just as so many oppressed and violated
souls have found refuge here already.]

01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:35.650
[Will it happen overnight? No.]

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:38.530
[Will it happen in a life time?
I don't know.]

01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:42.430
[Is it worth fighting for
until my last breath? Of course.]

01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:46.748
[Once you've seen what's possible,
how can you do otherwise?]
