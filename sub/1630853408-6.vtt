00:07.507 --> 00:08.550
I hate video.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.310
Most people love nostalgia.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.978
That's why they love video, but...

01:04.105 --> 01:06.065
you know, I'm just thinking

01:06.149 --> 01:08.109
maybe you don't even know
what video is.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.236
Maybe these are nostalgia
for you now.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.285
Nostalgia for a time traveler
is a bear trap.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.220
Memories are basically
trapdoors, but...

01:36.304 --> 01:38.890
no, I've already told you
that before...

01:43.895 --> 01:46.773

Garden party.

It's embarrassing.

Henry!

- Dad!

06:48.866 --> 06:49.867
Hey.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.497
- You want me to turn that off?
- No.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.375
Yeah, I'm not gay.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.337
If that's what you're thinking,
I'm not-- I'm not gay.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.756
There were two of you.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.676
Yeah, and the other one's gone.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.012
Are you hearing me, Dad?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.889
If you're thinking I'm gay,
I'm not-- I'm not.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.391
- That's not what was happening.
- Henry...

07:13.391 --> 07:16.227
Look, in my...
...circumstances,

07:16.227 --> 07:19.856
I have a particular opportunity,

07:19.856 --> 07:22.567
and I think that if more people
had the opportunity, I think...

07:22.567 --> 07:23.901
Henry, I don't care
if you're gay!

07:23.985 --> 07:26.487
I'm a professional musician,
everybody's gay!

07:30.241 --> 07:31.492
There were two of you.

07:34.412 --> 07:39.792
Okay. So, Dad, the thing is...

07:41.961 --> 07:43.921
I-- I'm a time traveler.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.424
It's true.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.385
I'm a time traveler.
I travel... in time.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.806
Sometimes there are two of me,
because I meet myself.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.225
Which, as I'm trying
to explain to you,

07:56.309 --> 07:58.561
presents a person
with a particular opportunity...

07:58.561 --> 07:59.854
You're a what?

08:02.773 --> 08:07.653
Yeah. It's true.
Sorry. It's just true.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.208
- It's all water.
- It's not all water.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.252
No... it is.

08:25.504 --> 08:28.674
You know, I should probably cut down.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.055
A time traveler?

08:35.514 --> 08:36.766
HENRY, 16:
All those times at school

08:36.766 --> 08:39.894
when I was disappearing,
I wasn't skipping class.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.104
I was time traveling.
I couldn't help it.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.234
Why do you say things like that?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.485
- It's true.
- Why do you say

08:47.485 --> 08:48.569
stupid things like that!

08:48.653 --> 08:50.238
- Dad!
- Why can't you just tell the truth?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.572
You kissed her in the rain.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.491
Mom.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.701
The very first time.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.120
You stood outside
of her apartment block.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.456
And when she walked inside,
you did a little dance.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.917
You didn't think
anyone could see you.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.210
You were wrong.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.963
I could see you.

09:14.595 --> 09:15.721
I danced too.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.686
I'm a time traveler,

09:22.687 --> 09:25.356
and I saw
my parents' first kiss.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.404
Can I turn that off now?
I... I can hear Mom's voice.

09:32.863 --> 09:33.864
I...

09:37.368 --> 09:38.869
I like hearing her voice.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.707
So do I. But it's just video.

09:43.791 --> 09:44.917
I hate video.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.502
CLARE, 20: You hate what?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.337
What does that even mean,
you "hate video"?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.299
- Everyone has a wedding video.
- Oh, okay, let's be everyone.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.508
What an ambition.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.177
I mean what-- what is it
we're doing here exactly?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.304
Looking at floral displays.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.014
- Why?
- To see which ones we prefer.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.765
How is a preference possible?
They're flowers.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.851
It's literally decorating
with vegetables.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.019
It'll be something to remind us.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.687
- What will? The vegetables?
- The video.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.813
It'll be nice to look back.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.189
I don't need to look back, Clare.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.482
- I go back.
- I don't.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.194
- God, I'm bored.
- Yeah, so you keep saying.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.155
Well, I'm planning to say it
a few more times too,

10:14.155 --> 10:15.531
because, basically, I'm bored.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.241
Can't we just remember it?
If people have videos,

10:17.325 --> 10:18.993
all they ever remember
is watching the video.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.244
I'm so bored

10:20.328 --> 10:21.954
that I'm growing new parts
of my brain to be bored in.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.247
CLARE, 20:
We're having a video.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.166
- You don't have to watch it.
- Do I have to be in it?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.167
Well, there has to be a groom,

10:26.167 --> 10:27.918
I'm increasingly open
to suggestions.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.754
Are you a bit grumpy today,
Henry?

10:29.754 --> 10:30.880
- No.
- He time traveled

10:30.880 --> 10:31.964
in his sleep last night.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.550
- Makes him cranky.
- Christ, I'm not cranky!

10:37.553 --> 10:38.846
Where did you go?

10:38.846 --> 10:40.473
Uh, I don't know.
It was a quick one.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.225
- Past or future?
- Future, I think.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.935
Because the air was thinner,
right?

10:45.019 --> 10:47.271
- No. The TV was huge.
- Awesome.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.398
How many people
for the top table?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.484
Henry, is your dad
gonna bring someone?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.278
I mean, is he, you know,
seeing anybody?

11:03.204 --> 11:04.205
Sorry.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.169
I just keep forgetting
my dad's gonna be there.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.837
Well,
of course he's gonna be there.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.049
I know.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.478
I'm looking forward
to meeting him.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.604
Who?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.314
Your dad.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.733
Oh. Okay.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.112
Have you forgotten that's what
we're doing tomorrow?

11:36.695 --> 11:38.155
HENRY, 28: No, no.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.699
Why do you avoid him?

11:42.493 --> 11:43.536
I don't. I see him.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.496
I mean, hardly ever.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.916
Yeah, well, he drinks too much.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.543
Well, I'm sure that's not
the only thing

11:50.543 --> 11:53.838
- you've got in common.
- It's not.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.507
When he looks at me, all he sees
is his wife not there.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.050
And when I look at him,
I'm just thinking

11:58.134 --> 12:00.094
where the hell Mom is.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.887
That's not the basis
for a relationship.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.098
It's the basis
for a drinking habit.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.559
Clare!

13:36.357 --> 13:38.692
- You okay?
- Yeah.

13:41.445 --> 13:42.696
You were gone most of the night.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.491
Well, it was about
two minutes for me.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.577
Well, where were you?
Was it a bad one?

13:52.289 --> 13:54.166
No, it was fine, it was nothing.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.920
Okay.

13:58.712 --> 13:59.922
Good.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.299
So you can get in the shower
now, yeah?

14:02.383 --> 14:05.386
- Are we going somewhere?
- You know where we're going.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.560
You never thought
of seeing a doctor?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.811
Getting yourself examined?

14:14.812 --> 14:15.938
Christ, no.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.357
- Why not?
- It's that word "examined."

14:18.357 --> 14:20.568
It's a little too close
to "dissected."

14:20.568 --> 14:22.069
They're not gonna dissect you!

14:22.069 --> 14:23.612
I'm the only time traveler
on the planet.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.406
They'd never let me
go home again.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.408
- Yes, they would.
- Why?

14:27.408 --> 14:29.410
Because I'm here now,
and because...

14:29.410 --> 14:31.245
I'm who you come home to,
and I'm not ever

14:31.245 --> 14:33.122
gonna let anyone keep you
away from me.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.582
Fact.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.375
Look at my face.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.419
Fact.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.090
That was "I love you,"
but in more words.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.636
Ah. You see, there it is.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.597
- There what is?
- HENRY, 28: You.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.765
Look at you.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.435
All beautiful and perfect
and in love with me.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.978
Now, I've got happiness.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.897
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Full-blown happiness.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.650
- Like an alarm bell.
- What? You're against happiness?

15:01.734 --> 15:04.445
Happiness is suddenly having
an opinion about a future.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.488
- Yes, it is.
- Which is a mistake.

15:09.908 --> 15:11.702
Henry, I love you
and you love me.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.746
Now, I don't want to get all
"greetings card" about it,

15:13.746 --> 15:16.790
but I happen to think, and
I'm not exactly alone in this,

15:16.874 --> 15:21.837
but I happen to think that love
is what gives meaning to life,

15:21.837 --> 15:24.131
and is the single best thing

15:24.131 --> 15:26.008
that could happen
to a human being.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.180
Love is what gives hope
to mortals.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.390
It's the cruelest thing I know.

15:34.933 --> 15:36.518
Okay. So what's good about this

15:36.602 --> 15:39.271
is that we are not gonna be
writing our own vows.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.363
Hey, Dad.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.493
Yeah, I know. Long time no see.
Guess your luck just ran out.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.412
Yes. Welcome.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.164
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:57.164 --> 16:01.043
- Uh, Clare, this is my dad.
- Very pleased to meet you.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.294
You're not blonde.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.881
Clare Abshire.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.842
Not blonde and he knows
your last name?

16:08.926 --> 16:11.095
You getting married?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.019
Beautiful.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.187
Wasn't she?

16:20.187 --> 16:21.563
CLARE, 20: Both of you.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.526
May I ask you a question?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.611
- Sure.
- You seem quite lovely.

16:28.696 --> 16:32.241
What on earth
is your interest in Henry?

16:34.284 --> 16:38.622
Well, to be honest...
he's exceptionally good in bed.

16:39.707 --> 16:40.874
Well, I know he thinks so.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.463
It was an opportunity.

16:46.547 --> 16:50.926
I think anyone given the same
opportunity would've, you know.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.438
- We got a date yet?
- October 23rd.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.149
My parents are planning
like we're invading somewhere.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.234
Church,
reception at the yachting club,

17:07.234 --> 17:09.028
and white tie
is being considered.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.488
- White tie?
- Didn't I tell you that?

17:11.572 --> 17:13.407
- What yachting club?
- Always remember, Henry,

17:13.407 --> 17:14.575
a marriage is about two people,

17:14.575 --> 17:16.910
but a wedding is about exactly
one woman.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.038
And you are marrying
her daughter.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.667
HENRY, 28:
<i>You liked him, didn't you?</i>

17:25.085 --> 17:27.296
He reminded me of you.

17:27.296 --> 17:31.425
- Was that a yes or a no?
- Both.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.221
Both...

17:46.190 --> 17:47.691
Fuck!

18:10.047 --> 18:13.634
I think this is exactly
the place you're looking for.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.677
There are a few items
of furniture still here

18:15.761 --> 18:17.805
they'll be picked up
over the next few days.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.348
Can we look
at the work area first?

18:19.348 --> 18:20.724
- The studio?
- Of course!

18:23.602 --> 18:25.604
- Why do you always do this?
- Do what?

18:25.604 --> 18:26.939
CLARE, 22:
Go straight to a window

18:26.939 --> 18:28.106
and look at the backyard.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.650
You never even look
at the rest of the house.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.360
The studio is this way.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.945
Could you give us a moment,
please?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.488
- Of course.
- Thanks.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.115
The studio's gonna be great.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.618
- This is the one.
- We haven't even seen it yet.

18:39.618 --> 18:40.828
Oh, I've seen it lots of times.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.746
This is the house we are
gonna live in, in the future.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.415
See that tree out there?

18:46.917 --> 18:49.586
I have seen that tree
at every kind of height.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.214
What if I feel like
deciding for myself?

18:52.214 --> 18:53.298
Oh, you should do that.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.008
But this is the decision
you're gonna make.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.221
Is anything allowed
to be spontaneous anymore?

18:59.221 --> 19:01.515
You are being spontaneous.
I'm just telling you

19:01.515 --> 19:04.059
how your spontaneity
is gonna work out.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.477
Do you have
any idea what it's like

19:05.561 --> 19:06.687
being married to you?

19:06.687 --> 19:10.399
No, but neither do you.
Technically we're not married.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.192
- Fair point.
- Hmm.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.570
Come on.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.030
Let's go and look
at this excellent studio space

19:17.114 --> 19:19.324
which you are gonna love spontaneously.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.077
How do we even afford
a place like this?

19:22.077 --> 19:23.745
Are you planning
on winning the lottery?

19:24.204 --> 19:25.956
Okay.

- Lottery's tonight, eight o'clock.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.647
without stressing out
and time traveling.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.983
- Ugh. You're still doing that?
- Still doing it.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.902
What's gonna stress you out
for nine hours?

29:38.902 --> 29:42.238
- My wedding day.
- I should call Evangeline.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.157
- Evangeline?
- I promised to get her cat food,

29:44.157 --> 29:46.409
- I forgot.
- Why is that relevant?

29:46.493 --> 29:48.620
It's not.
It just came to mind.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.081
Could you maybe focus?
I need something to...

29:52.165 --> 29:55.001
KO every dopamine receptor
I got for at least nine hours.

29:55.001 --> 29:57.337
- You got anything for that?
- Mm.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.215
HENRY, 28: What's that?
Morphine plus.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.299
Morphine plus what?

30:01.299 --> 30:02.884
Morphine plus
none of your business.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.803
- Can I try it?
- Now?

30:05.887 --> 30:07.722
Oh, God, no.
- Wh-- why not?

30:07.722 --> 30:10.016
Because I might do it badly,
'cause I'm nervous.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.142
You cut hair for a living.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.352
What's the worst
that can happen?

30:12.352 --> 30:14.395
- I could stab your brain.
- What's that?

30:14.479 --> 30:16.356
- What's what?
- That song?

30:16.356 --> 30:18.775
- The radio.
- Yeah, but that song,

30:18.775 --> 30:20.109
I know that song.

30:20.193 --> 30:25.615
♪ ("GET ME TO THE CHURCH
ON TIME" PLAYING) ♪

30:27.700 --> 30:29.702
- What are you doing?
- ♪ ♪

30:29.786 --> 30:31.955
Um, it's just a thing.

30:33.915 --> 30:34.916
"A thing"?

30:39.254 --> 30:42.840
You have the most
irresponsible attitude

30:42.924 --> 30:46.636
to pharmaceuticals of anyone
I ever met.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.766
I make a suggestion,

30:52.642 --> 30:54.477
I show you a pill,

30:55.603 --> 30:57.397
a sensible person

30:57.397 --> 30:59.857
is not supposed
to just swallow it.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.242
I know you're in there.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.703
I know my friend is too.
Open up, please.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.457
- Wh-- why-- what do you want?
- What you gotta know?

31:16.541 --> 31:18.251
I'm a lawyer,
who has clients in this area,

31:18.251 --> 31:20.587
and I know exactly who you are,
and what you do.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.921
None of this is good news.

31:22.005 --> 31:27.635
But it will be even worse news,
if you don't open this door!

31:30.138 --> 31:31.347
Sure.

31:33.433 --> 31:36.144
Okay,
and what you gotta know is,

31:36.144 --> 31:37.729
sometimes there are side effects

31:37.729 --> 31:41.024
which are not directly
the fault of the vendor.

31:46.362 --> 31:47.614
Shit.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.246
CLARE, 29: You don't make
decisions like that,
not on your own!

31:55.330 --> 31:56.956
HENRY, 36:
I didn't have a choice!
I know what happens!

31:57.040 --> 31:59.542
- CLARE, 29: You have to come to me, and we talk about it!
- HENRY, 36: Why?

31:59.626 --> 32:01.127
CLARE, 29: That is what wives
and husbands do!

32:02.712 --> 32:04.172
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

32:04.172 --> 32:06.382
CLARE, 29: I will never forgive you for this, Henry!

32:25.902 --> 32:28.321
Oh, thank fuck!
Where the hell have you been?

33:29.090 --> 33:30.508
HENRY, 36: That's not the point!
I know what happened!

33:30.508 --> 33:32.051
CLARE, 29:
And you wouldn't talk
to your wife?

33:32.135 --> 33:33.886
- HENRY, 36: You're not my fucking wife!
- I'm your cat?

33:33.970 --> 33:35.513
- HENRY, 36: Fuck you!
- CLARE, 29: Fuck you!

33:35.513 --> 33:37.098
I will never forgive you!

33:46.983 --> 33:50.820
Henry. Hey. Hey, hey, Henry!
Henry!

33:50.820 --> 33:52.321
- Henry, you okay?
- What are you doing here?

33:52.405 --> 33:54.198
I called him,
I thought maybe he could help.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.616
My Dad?
What the fuck does he know?

33:55.700 --> 33:56.993
I figured he's gotta
know something.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.536
You're getting married
in seven hours.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.079
- I was freaking out.
- Seven hours?

34:00.163 --> 34:03.040
- You've been gone a whole day.
- Are you okay, huh? Can you hang on?

34:03.124 --> 34:04.125
Doesn't usually work this way.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.418
Yeah,
well he's not usually high.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.836
Just to be clear,
I am not a drug dealer.

34:06.836 --> 34:09.047
I supply unauthorized medical
care to the genuinely ill.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.340
- You're also a drug dealer.
- It's a matter of emphasis.

34:12.341 --> 34:13.342
Dad.

36:18.050 --> 36:19.135
CLARE, 29: Go away.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.263
Please. Just go away.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.002
HENRY, 36: Of course
I told her. How could I not?

36:53.753 --> 36:56.380
Well, she... hates me.

36:56.464 --> 36:57.965
She said
I was basically a murderer,

36:58.049 --> 36:59.884
so yeah, I guess you could say
it went down badly.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.182
Sorry, David, I got to go.

37:08.184 --> 37:09.185
No.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.395
Just a ghost.

37:14.523 --> 37:15.775
Why did you call me a ghost?

37:15.775 --> 37:16.943
HENRY, 36: You are a ghost.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.863
From where I'm sitting.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.574
Let's see, when are you from?

37:24.992 --> 37:26.577
Before the wedding?

37:26.661 --> 37:28.496
Worrying about the future?
Haunting it?

37:28.496 --> 37:30.456
Why is Clare crying?

37:30.456 --> 37:32.500
- Because people do sometimes.
- HENRY, 28: No.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.126
She's not people,
she's your wife.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.170
- Why is your wife crying?
- No, she isn't.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.297
I just saw her.
I just spoke to her.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.757
She isn't my wife.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.177
Technically speaking.

37:45.805 --> 37:46.847
Sorry, junior.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.474
You tried, but you couldn't
stick the landing.

37:51.769 --> 37:52.812
Speaking of which.

37:57.900 --> 37:58.943
Miscarriages?

38:03.322 --> 38:05.616
I make time travel babies,
and guess what?

38:07.243 --> 38:08.869
Time travel
right out of the womb.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.376
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.131
What have you done?

38:22.425 --> 38:24.510
I know you've done something.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.470
Whatever it is,
Clare hates you for it,

38:26.554 --> 38:27.763
you just said so yourself.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.726
Do you have any idea
what this has been like?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.773
Every time she gets pregnant...

38:38.983 --> 38:40.151
every time...

38:41.861 --> 38:43.029
she thinks this is the one.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.074
This time, it'll happen.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.120
She's so full of hope.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.291
She's so happy,
it fills up this whole house.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.129
And I always know
it won't work.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.424
It won't ever, ever, work.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.009
And do you know
how long I've known that?

39:08.346 --> 39:10.514
Since I was standing
on the other side of this desk.

39:12.558 --> 39:13.601
Since I was you.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.273
You had a vasectomy?

39:20.483 --> 39:21.859
- Yeah.
- You didn't even tell her?

39:21.859 --> 39:24.070
- You just went ahead and did it?
- Yeah. That's what I did.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.321
I'm not gonna do that.

39:27.239 --> 39:28.908
That's exactly
what you're gonna do.

39:36.832 --> 39:38.709
HENRY, 36: How long
are you here for, junior?

39:40.503 --> 39:42.630
My memory's a little fuzzy.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.466
Hey. Did you hear me?
I'm not gonna do that.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.635
Of course, you're high.
That probably explains it.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.304
- I will never do that to Clare.
- No, you will do exactly that,

39:50.304 --> 39:52.306
because that's what happens
and you can't change it!

39:52.306 --> 39:54.266
- Fuck you!
- Oh, what, you're gonna change it?

39:54.350 --> 39:55.309
You can't change it!

39:55.393 --> 39:56.644
Fucking doofus,
can't change anything.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.479
- Yeah, well, I'm changing this.
- Fuck off!

39:58.479 --> 39:59.897
You couldn't even get married.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.422
Henry? Who are you shouting at?

40:53.951 --> 40:54.785
Jesus.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.912
You like cutting it fine,
don't you?

40:56.996 --> 40:59.832
You all right? You all right? Yeah?

41:04.003 --> 41:05.421
Hello?

41:05.421 --> 41:07.715
HENRY, 28:
Clare, it's me. let me in.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.717
Henry?
<i>He's back, we got him.</i>

41:09.717 --> 41:10.759
Oh, thank Christ!

41:10.843 --> 41:12.052
<i>I'll get him
to the church.</i>

41:12.136 --> 41:14.013
Okay, okay, good.
Thank you.

41:15.472 --> 41:16.682
Gomez, look at him.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.851
Yeah, I see him.
We need to get going.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.227
Look at him.

41:24.607 --> 41:25.858
It's the wrong Henry.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.028
Well now,
isn't this complicated?

41:31.947 --> 41:35.075
Thank you. Sorry, thank you.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.535
Sorry.

41:38.078 --> 41:39.663
- I'll get you a towel.
- HENRY, 26: Please.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.544
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

41:45.628 --> 41:46.921
- You're--
- Yup.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.637
- Here.
- Thanks.

41:58.807 --> 42:01.602
- Did you just punch my husband?
- You're welcome.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.980
Oh, Christ. No, not tonight.

42:05.064 --> 42:07.274
Fuck.
I can't take this, not tonight.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.361
Look, I know how hard this is.
I know this is difficult.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.655
CLARE, 29:
No, you don't understand.

42:12.655 --> 42:15.074
- I'm not ready for this.
- Ready for what?

42:16.784 --> 42:18.744
- It's shoe polish day.
- Shoe polish what?

42:19.662 --> 42:21.747
It's shoe polish day.

42:21.747 --> 42:23.832
We need the other one back.
Where's the other one?

42:23.916 --> 42:25.084
And what age are you anyway?

42:25.084 --> 42:26.460
Thirty-six by the calendar year.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.878
- Hey, am I still there?
- Where?

42:27.962 --> 42:29.213
- When you're 36.
- HENRY, 36: Yeah.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.674
- We played pool last Tuesday.
- Thanks, man.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.886
Shoe polish!
I need shoe polish!

42:35.970 --> 42:37.304
- Shoe polish?
- Why?

42:37.388 --> 42:39.556
Well, I'm guessing none of you
guys are carrying hair dye.

42:41.725 --> 42:43.644
No offense,
but your husband's an asshole.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.562
CLARE, 29: True. Remind me.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.231
Why don't you like
watching videos?

42:48.941 --> 42:50.901
The past is a hole
I keep falling down.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.861
Looking at it gives me vertigo.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.781
Well, this isn't the past.
This is right now.

42:57.199 --> 42:59.118
- How is this ever gonna work?
- Relax.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.786
I know how this plays out.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.788
I handle the wedding,
then I ping back home.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.457
Then junior pings back here,
and he handles the marriage.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.127
- He won't be married.
- Well, technically, no.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.174
Well.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.344
What do you think, Dad?
Do I pass?

43:17.428 --> 43:19.847
Your mother would be proud.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.475
Well, that's all
that matters, right?

43:26.770 --> 43:27.813
You okay?

43:29.690 --> 43:30.816
The way you look at me.

43:32.067 --> 43:33.068
What?

43:34.194 --> 43:35.654
Like you haven't seen me
in a while.

43:42.995 --> 43:43.954
Dad, I-- I-- know that--

43:44.038 --> 43:45.539
Your mother would be proud,
and so am I.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.418
Okay!
Let's get moving, hmm?

43:51.545 --> 43:52.755
Hey, Dad.
Hmm?

43:55.090 --> 43:56.634
- Was it worth it?
- Getting married?

43:56.634 --> 43:58.427
- Of course it is.
- No, no.

43:59.303 --> 44:00.679
Serious thing, serious question.

44:02.848 --> 44:05.809
What I'm asking is, was marrying
Mom worth losing her?

44:07.394 --> 44:09.897
This isn't about me.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.483
It's about Clare.
I'm aging faster than I should,

44:12.483 --> 44:13.734
and I've seen enough
of the future

44:13.734 --> 44:16.028
to know that I'm not
gonna make it all the way, so...

44:18.822 --> 44:19.907
for Clare's sake.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.744
Was marrying Mom
worth losing her?

44:26.580 --> 44:28.665
- That's a big question.
- Well, it's a big day.

44:31.627 --> 44:32.628
Yeah.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.090
It wasn't easy...

44:37.049 --> 44:38.092
but it was worth it.

44:40.511 --> 44:41.512
Thanks.

44:42.388 --> 44:43.430
Because of you.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.436
I don't say it enough,
but it was worth it

44:49.520 --> 44:50.521
because of you.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.109
Give her a child.

44:57.152 --> 45:00.280
If you can't stay, do that.

45:02.074 --> 45:03.492
Give her a child.

45:04.827 --> 45:08.539
Well, there might be
a problem with that.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.165
Problems can be solved.

45:15.671 --> 45:16.797
Not this one, Dad.

45:18.298 --> 45:21.301
Guys, come on.
I gotta get you to the church.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.719
- Okay. We're coming.
- On time!

45:22.803 --> 45:24.388
- Oh, I know.
- There's kind of a joke about that.

45:24.388 --> 45:25.722
You'll see. Come on.

45:25.806 --> 45:28.142
I know about the joke, Gomez.
I've watched the video.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.606
I mean,
what's the point of this?

45:34.690 --> 45:36.608
I'm not gonna show up.
I'm not--

45:42.197 --> 45:46.326
No. You have gotta
be shitting me.

45:46.410 --> 45:49.621
- You have got to be shitting me.
- CLARE, 29: Hmm.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.168
What the fuck is he doing there?

45:54.168 --> 45:56.753
- He's getting married.
- Yeah. To my girlfriend!

45:57.504 --> 45:58.338
CLARE, 29:
Keep in mind,

45:58.422 --> 45:59.673
he remembers
watching these videos.

45:59.673 --> 46:01.091
- HENRY, 28: Why?
- HENRY, 36: <i>Asshole.</i>

46:01.175 --> 46:03.719
Oh, nice.

46:03.719 --> 46:06.388
Classy. Very classy.
In a church!

46:07.764 --> 46:09.016
He'll remember that too.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.643
Yeah, you make quite
an impression on the cameraman.

46:16.899 --> 46:17.983
Hi.

46:19.693 --> 46:21.361
I'm so sorry.
We're running very late,

46:21.445 --> 46:23.447
we're gonna have to bring
the bride in straight away.

46:23.447 --> 46:26.867
Oh, yeah. No problems.
Just lock and load!

46:32.706 --> 46:33.916
All right, remember,
don't let anyone

46:33.916 --> 46:35.542
get a good look at you
in case they notice

46:35.626 --> 46:36.793
how old and shitty you are.

46:36.877 --> 46:38.504
Oh, thanks, Gomez.
Way to calm my nerves.

46:38.504 --> 46:41.381
Oh, don't be nervous,
you'll crinkle.

47:17.209 --> 47:18.460
I thought you'd be angrier.

47:19.836 --> 47:21.630
I am angry.

47:21.630 --> 47:24.049
I'm gonna be angry
for a very long time.

47:24.049 --> 47:25.801
Now shut up and admire my dress.

47:55.998 --> 47:57.332
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

47:59.167 --> 48:01.336
Yep. Now she's getting it.

48:12.514 --> 48:15.225
- Where is he?
- You look amazing.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.768
You smell of shoe polish.

48:17.728 --> 48:20.522
- You must be glad I hit him.
- Why?

48:21.690 --> 48:23.400
I saw your face.
I saw you fighting.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.611
- You-- you hated him.
- No, I never hate him.

48:25.611 --> 48:27.863
<i>Dearly beloved, we have
come together into the house...</i>

48:27.863 --> 48:29.239
I mean, I could punch
his stupid,

48:29.323 --> 48:31.617
thoughtless little face in,
but I could never hate him.

48:33.535 --> 48:34.745
HENRY, 28: What's he doing?

48:35.704 --> 48:36.705
Remembering.

48:37.372 --> 48:38.373
I love you.

48:38.457 --> 48:39.958
<i>...Clare and Henry.</i>

48:40.042 --> 48:41.001
Asshole.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.252
<i>Have you come here,</i>

48:42.336 --> 48:44.838
to enter into marriage
without coercion,

48:44.838 --> 48:46.798
freely and wholeheartedly?

48:46.882 --> 48:48.592
- I have.
- I have.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.385
Are you prepared
to accept children,

48:50.469 --> 48:52.346
lovingly from God?

48:52.346 --> 48:53.639
<i>And to bring them up,</i>

48:53.639 --> 48:55.766
<i>according to the law of Christ
and his church?</i>

48:55.766 --> 48:57.559
- HENRY, 36: <i>I am.</i>
- CLARE, 20: <i>I am.</i>

48:58.644 --> 48:59.936
I hate what he did to you.

49:01.938 --> 49:05.150
CLARE, 29: Oh, he did
what he thought he had to.

49:05.150 --> 49:08.320
I guess 'cause he thought
I couldn't take it anymore.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.821
And... <i>- I, Henry...</i>

49:09.905 --> 49:12.658
...well, because
he definitely couldn't.

49:12.658 --> 49:14.451
Thing is, I wanted children.

49:16.036 --> 49:18.497
I wanted your children
more than anything in the world.

49:18.497 --> 49:20.874
- And I want that too.
- No.

49:20.874 --> 49:24.586
- In sickness and in health...
- You gave up after five tries.

49:24.670 --> 49:25.962
...until death do us part.

49:26.046 --> 49:28.507
I would never have given up.
I would have done anything.

49:31.468 --> 49:32.886
So how are you gonna forgive me?

49:34.262 --> 49:36.682
I, Clare, take you, Henry...

49:36.682 --> 49:38.725
I guess I'm gonna have
to figure that one out.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.102
CLARE, 20:
<i>To have and to hold</i>

49:40.102 --> 49:43.188
<i>from this day forward.
For better, for worse...</i>

49:43.188 --> 49:45.148
But I'm supposed
to make you happy.

49:45.232 --> 49:47.484
CLARE, 20:
<i>In sickness and in health...</i>

49:47.484 --> 49:49.277
Who told you that?

49:49.361 --> 49:52.155
To love and to cherish,
until death do us part.

49:54.908 --> 49:59.413
Oh! Look at that face.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.542
How old are you now?
Twenty-eight?

50:03.542 --> 50:04.668
Yeah.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.379
Twenty-eight.

50:08.630 --> 50:12.426
Mm. Hey, I'm the older woman.

50:12.426 --> 50:14.970
Finally! I like this.

50:17.514 --> 50:20.142
Henry, we're not supposed
to make each other happy.

50:22.269 --> 50:26.940
If we do, great,
but that's not the point.

50:29.818 --> 50:31.236
We're getting married.

50:32.362 --> 50:35.407
Not going on a hot date,
or a vacation,

50:35.407 --> 50:38.910
or a weekend away somewhere,
but, actually...

50:39.870 --> 50:41.079
getting married.

50:43.039 --> 50:44.207
I mean, look at us.

50:45.125 --> 50:46.168
Look.

50:48.336 --> 50:52.048
Do we look like
we're gonna go on vacation?

50:55.427 --> 50:56.928
It's like...

50:59.306 --> 51:03.018
...like setting sail,
into a storm.

51:04.436 --> 51:06.104
And you know for a fact,

51:06.188 --> 51:08.440
you both won't make it out
the other side.

51:08.440 --> 51:09.733
So what do you do?

51:12.611 --> 51:15.030
You cling on
for as long as you can,

51:15.030 --> 51:16.448
because you know,

51:17.657 --> 51:20.619
that this is as good
as anything ever gets.

51:25.373 --> 51:27.125
Make my happy days happier...

51:29.920 --> 51:31.838
make my sad days bearable.

51:34.424 --> 51:36.885
And if you forgive me
when I hurt you,

51:36.885 --> 51:38.512
I'll try to do
the same for you.

51:40.096 --> 51:41.097
Deal?

51:45.060 --> 51:46.228
Okay.

51:50.857 --> 51:52.108
I miss you.

51:54.069 --> 51:56.613
- Uh, sorry, what?
- I miss you.

51:56.613 --> 52:02.160
You... you...
...young, angry, asshole you.

52:05.413 --> 52:06.581
Did I make you change?

52:07.791 --> 52:09.251
Did I chase you away?

52:10.377 --> 52:14.631
- Well, uh, I...
- Come see me sometimes.

52:14.631 --> 52:17.509
- Excuse me?
- Well, if you time travel here,

52:17.509 --> 52:20.762
come see me.
You're my husband, I'm entitled.

52:22.138 --> 52:28.770
- Isn't that, uh... a bit...
- Henry, we're married.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.278
