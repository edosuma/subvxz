00:01.034 --> 00:01.968
Do you have any
sexually transmitted diseases?

00:01.968 --> 00:03.370
Are you serious right now?

00:03.370 --> 00:05.271
[Male Announcer]
Previously on "Sistas"...

00:05.271 --> 00:07.707
I told him about Andi and Paris.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.008
Why would you do that?

00:09.008 --> 00:10.510
Now she's going
to think it's me.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.245
Think! We had a perfect plan.
What are you doing?

00:12.245 --> 00:13.680
Sabrina is in jail.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.248
You think I don't know that?

00:15.248 --> 00:17.016
She's not a hood chick.
She can't do jail.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.518
Is your girlfriend
coming?

00:18.518 --> 00:19.953
No.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.154
That's too bad.
I wanted to meet her.

00:21.154 --> 00:22.455
She can help with Sabrina?

00:22.455 --> 00:23.857
Yes.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.725
Her favors
are kind of expensive,

00:25.725 --> 00:27.160
but I'm blood, so...

00:27.160 --> 00:29.462
Hi. I'm Marilyn.
Folks call me Madam.

00:30.889 --> 00:32.925
And look at you!
Girl, you wearing that.

00:32.925 --> 00:34.293
What is that, a jumper?
Let me see.

00:34.293 --> 00:38.130
Thank you. Okay. How you doing?

00:38.130 --> 00:39.631
Can't complain.
Mm-hmm.

00:39.631 --> 00:41.200
They pouring you up
a glass of wine right now.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.568
Thank you. Please.
Catch up.

00:42.568 --> 00:43.836
Ooh, yes, girl.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.504
This club has been
stressing me out.

00:45.504 --> 00:46.605
Club?

00:46.605 --> 00:48.040
-Yeah.
-Oh.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.509
Yeah, she actually
owns Club Eden.

00:50.509 --> 00:51.643
Really?

00:51.643 --> 00:53.112
Yeah.

00:53.112 --> 00:54.880
Wow. My girlfriends
and I were just there.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.315
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

00:56.315 --> 00:57.483
When?

00:57.483 --> 00:59.551
I forget,
but it wasn't too long ago.

00:59.551 --> 01:02.187
Okay.
Did you guys enjoy yourself?

01:02.187 --> 01:03.722
Oh, we had the best time.
It was great.

01:03.722 --> 01:05.190
Well, good.
That's what I love to hear.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.458
You know that.
There you go.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.160
Thank you.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.661
You know what, guys?
Let's go sit in the living room.

01:09.661 --> 01:11.430
-I'm looking for information.
-Okay.

01:11.430 --> 01:15.601
-Okay. Yes.
-All right, yeah.

01:15.601 --> 01:18.337
I'll go.

01:18.337 --> 01:19.438
Wow.

01:19.438 --> 01:22.040
I love what you did
with this place.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.343
Just getting to know her.

01:24.343 --> 01:28.013
-Thank you.
-It's gorgeous in here.

01:28.013 --> 01:29.882
Thanks.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.617
Okay.

01:33.485 --> 01:38.157
All right.
So, what can I do for you?

01:38.157 --> 01:40.092
What? What do you mean?

01:40.092 --> 01:41.794
Fatima, why did you
call me over here?

01:45.831 --> 01:47.232
Well...

01:47.232 --> 01:49.268
Well, the last time
you called me,

01:49.268 --> 01:52.037
you had me beat a -- ass
and throw him on top of a car,

01:52.037 --> 01:54.173
so what do you want?

01:54.173 --> 01:56.108
Wait. That was you?

01:57.109 --> 01:59.378
Yeah, she was
responsible for all of that.

02:00.245 --> 02:04.049
What is going on? Well...

02:04.049 --> 02:05.184
You want to tell her?

02:05.184 --> 02:07.319
Oh, no, please. Tell her.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.354
Somebody tell me.

02:09.354 --> 02:10.756
I mean,
I already know the story,

02:10.756 --> 02:13.125
and I still want
to hear it again. Go ahead.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.327
Somebody? Anybody?

02:16.228 --> 02:18.130
I'm just gonna sip my wine.

02:19.465 --> 02:22.401
Well, Marilyn is my cousin.

02:23.202 --> 02:24.803
Yes, you already
told her that Fatima,

02:24.803 --> 02:28.774
but what you did not tell her
was how close we used to be.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.309
Yes, until...

02:30.309 --> 02:33.645
Until you decided
to go all legal and shit.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.849
Oh.

02:36.849 --> 02:39.518
Oh? Is she judging me?

02:39.518 --> 02:41.153
-Oh, no. No.
-Are you judging me?

02:41.153 --> 02:42.321
No.

02:42.321 --> 02:44.389
No, she is not.

02:44.389 --> 02:46.825
Okay. Well, what is
that you do for a living?

02:46.825 --> 02:48.660
Hmm?

02:48.660 --> 02:49.995
I'm an attorney.

02:49.995 --> 02:53.732
Oh! Shit!
Okay.

02:55.100 --> 02:58.003
Here I think I just met
a new girlfriend.

02:58.003 --> 03:00.272
Oh. Okay.

03:00.272 --> 03:01.874
You can drink to that!

03:01.874 --> 03:03.075
Speaking of, cheers.

03:03.075 --> 03:04.076
Cheers.

03:25.165 --> 03:26.667
I'm good. Thank you.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.101
All right. Zac?

03:28.101 --> 03:29.570
No.

03:29.570 --> 03:33.707
Okay. Well, what?
You waiting for her to call you?

03:35.409 --> 03:37.945
No, actually I just want
to do what we came to do,

03:37.945 --> 03:39.646
so I can leave.

03:40.981 --> 03:44.151
Wow. An hour
of your time is too much?

03:45.319 --> 03:47.387
I've been here
longer than an hour.

03:49.990 --> 03:51.925
So, this is what you all do.

03:51.925 --> 03:53.660
No, this is what she does.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.362
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

03:56.663 --> 03:58.131
All right. Stop it.

03:58.131 --> 04:00.334
You know what?
Let's get down to business.

04:00.334 --> 04:04.638
You know what, Mama?
I don't want to do this.

04:04.638 --> 04:06.073
No, baby,
you're going to do this.

04:06.073 --> 04:07.374
What are we doing?

04:07.374 --> 04:08.909
You...
Can you just let her talk?

04:08.909 --> 04:10.410
Do not...
Don't say anything to me.

04:10.410 --> 04:11.979
We're not--Yo, look. We don't
want to stress her out, man.

04:11.979 --> 04:13.480
-[Karen] All right.
-I'm not stressin' her out, bro.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.782
Y'all both been
stressing me out.

04:15.782 --> 04:17.384
If that's the case,
I can just leave then.

04:17.384 --> 04:19.219
-Go ahead.
-No, wait. Zac, please.

04:19.219 --> 04:21.421
No, Ms. Lisa. She--

04:21.421 --> 04:23.557
-Sit down.
-No, Mama.

04:23.557 --> 04:26.326
Let him go.
That's what he does

04:26.326 --> 04:28.595
when you say something
he don't like. He leaves.

04:29.429 --> 04:35.302
Zac, sit. Thank you.

04:36.503 --> 04:41.074
Okay. Well, I told Karen
to write down

04:41.074 --> 04:44.444
on a piece of paper
what she's feeling,

04:44.444 --> 04:47.381
and the one thing
I want both of you to do,

04:47.381 --> 04:48.949
no matter how hard it is,

04:48.949 --> 04:52.753
is to sit here and listen
to what she has to say.

04:52.753 --> 04:54.087
What? Why?

04:54.087 --> 04:55.455
Man, can you just
chill out, dude?

04:55.455 --> 04:56.690
Dude, stop talking to me!

04:56.690 --> 04:58.592
The one thing
we're not doing

04:58.592 --> 05:01.361
is this toxic masculinity.
Okay?

05:03.363 --> 05:07.834
Okay. Now, I asked her
to write it down.

05:08.935 --> 05:11.305
I want you both
to sit calmly

05:11.305 --> 05:14.775
and please just listen
to what she has to say.

05:18.011 --> 05:23.750
Fine. Who do I start with?

05:23.750 --> 05:25.419
Start with whomever.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.102
Okay.

05:42.102 --> 05:47.708
Aaron, you've come into my life
at a really strange time.

05:50.677 --> 05:53.914
I was on the heels
of a relationship

05:53.914 --> 05:56.450
ending with a man I thought
I would be with

05:56.450 --> 05:58.318
for the rest of my life.

05:59.319 --> 06:03.357
Every day,
I tried not to use you,

06:03.357 --> 06:07.494
but there were times
when I felt like I was.

06:07.494 --> 06:10.330
I'm sure you felt it too,
because of your ex-wife,

06:10.330 --> 06:11.832
how all of this started.

06:11.832 --> 06:15.502
It was wrong,
and I never trusted it.

06:16.603 --> 06:20.974
I always felt like karma
was going to be bad for us

06:20.974 --> 06:23.009
because it was messy,

06:23.009 --> 06:26.780
and she thought we were doing
something way before we were.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.482
We both know that.

06:32.819 --> 06:38.592
I didn't want to be
with you at first,

06:38.592 --> 06:41.261
but you keep showing
what kind of man you are.

06:42.729 --> 06:46.533
And, I've waited and waited
for you to switch up,

06:49.302 --> 06:53.774
but you stayed consistent
unlike Zac.

06:57.177 --> 07:00.680
You check on me.
You keep your word,

07:02.015 --> 07:05.452
always put me first
no matter what's going on.

07:05.452 --> 07:07.487
You've even offered
to pay for things.

07:08.688 --> 07:13.026
You treat me like I've always
wanted to be treated...

07:17.831 --> 07:19.032
...by Zac.

07:21.001 --> 07:22.302
It's almost like...

07:22.302 --> 07:23.503
Come on, man!
What is this, bro?

07:23.503 --> 07:25.338
Come on, Zac. Please. Sit down.

07:26.473 --> 07:28.742
This is not a request!
Sit!

07:34.281 --> 07:37.684
It's almost like I wish

07:37.684 --> 07:42.989
that I could have met you
first before him,

07:44.357 --> 07:48.728
before any of them because,

07:48.728 --> 07:52.566
well, then I would know how
I was supposed to be treated.

07:59.039 --> 08:03.810
It's like, if I had...

08:04.377 --> 08:06.046
I can't.

08:06.046 --> 08:08.381
Zac, please!

08:08.381 --> 08:12.619
I know it's tough, but please.

08:19.493 --> 08:22.996
Because I met you second,

08:28.001 --> 08:31.571
you now

08:31.571 --> 08:33.874
have to deal with

08:33.874 --> 08:37.444
the woman who's endured
all the lying and cheating.

08:41.047 --> 08:43.250
And because

08:43.250 --> 08:46.119
I fell in love
with a damn fool,

08:47.087 --> 08:49.456
I just didn't have
anything left for you.

08:50.357 --> 08:52.192
Because of all the damage that's
done,

08:52.192 --> 08:56.429
I don't know how

08:56.429 --> 09:00.333
to show you how I feel.

09:00.700 --> 09:04.137
I don't know if I'll ever be
the woman that you deserve.

09:06.139 --> 09:10.443
I don't know what kind of woman
I am after my last relationship.

09:10.443 --> 09:12.812
I don't.

09:18.084 --> 09:22.122
So I'm sorry that I've put you
through all of this,

09:22.122 --> 09:24.824
and I truly, truly love you.

09:30.864 --> 09:33.066
But I'm not in love with you.

09:37.604 --> 09:39.472
I don't know if
I'll ever be in love

09:39.472 --> 09:42.175
with anybody else again
in my life,

09:42.175 --> 09:47.247
not like I love him.

09:47.247 --> 09:51.251
Everything hurts,

09:51.251 --> 09:54.154
and I don't know how to fix it.

09:56.756 --> 10:00.994
I'm sorry you feel that way,

10:02.929 --> 10:04.598
but I understand.

10:05.532 --> 10:07.400
You do?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.935
Yeah.

10:08.935 --> 10:12.505
Yeah, I've been there,
but you were that for me.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.942
You woke me up.

10:17.143 --> 10:18.912
Love-hate is...

10:21.481 --> 10:24.951
it's sort of like
a circuit breaker.

10:27.621 --> 10:31.925
When you trip it,
it goes dead,

10:33.460 --> 10:36.463
and you just don't
feel anything,

10:36.463 --> 10:38.164
and you can't see the light.

10:39.766 --> 10:42.102
It's not until somebody
finds the breaker box

10:42.102 --> 10:47.507
and flips the switch back
on that you see the light again,

10:47.507 --> 10:49.142
and you start to feel again.

10:49.876 --> 10:52.746
That's beautiful.
And, I get that.

10:53.913 --> 10:55.448
Yeah.

10:55.448 --> 10:57.717
And that's what
I wanted to do with you.

10:59.686 --> 11:02.722
[Karen] What if I can't?

11:02.722 --> 11:04.591
It's worth a shot.

11:13.233 --> 11:15.035
Who's there?

11:15.035 --> 11:19.005
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know
anyone was still here.

11:19.005 --> 11:20.674
It's all good.

11:20.674 --> 11:21.908
Can I get your trash?

11:21.908 --> 11:23.143
Yeah.

11:23.143 --> 11:24.544
Thanks.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.385
Are you Paris?

11:32.385 --> 11:33.953
Yeah.

11:33.953 --> 11:35.522
Janitor?

11:35.522 --> 11:37.857
Yup.

11:37.857 --> 11:40.060
I'm sorry, Paris,
can you come in here?

11:40.060 --> 11:41.895
Sure.

11:43.229 --> 11:44.964
Do you know Andi?

11:45.999 --> 11:47.300
Andi?

11:47.300 --> 11:48.968
Barnes.

11:48.968 --> 11:50.470
Oh, yeah,
one of the lawyers?

11:50.470 --> 11:52.205
Yeah, yeah. What's up?

11:52.205 --> 11:56.042
How well do you know her?

11:56.042 --> 11:59.579
Only from here.

11:59.579 --> 12:02.382
Have you ever taken her out?

12:02.382 --> 12:04.084
Uh, no.

12:04.084 --> 12:05.452
No?

12:05.452 --> 12:09.889
No. I'm sorry.
And you are?

12:10.790 --> 12:12.859
I'm Robin. I own the firm.

12:12.859 --> 12:14.694
Oh, yeah. That's right.
We heard about a takeover.

12:14.694 --> 12:16.696
Nice. Nice.

12:18.498 --> 12:21.000
So, you've never taken her out?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.336
No.

12:23.336 --> 12:26.639
Huh. Okay.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.243
Did somebody tell you
something differently?

12:31.644 --> 12:33.279
No.

12:33.279 --> 12:34.814
Okay.

12:34.814 --> 12:36.950
But, I mean, you'd like
to take her out, right?

12:37.951 --> 12:41.788
Well, she is
a beautiful woman,

12:41.788 --> 12:44.157
but she is way out
of my league.

12:46.226 --> 12:48.161
You think so?

12:48.161 --> 12:50.663
Oh, yeah! Janitor.

12:50.663 --> 12:54.200
Hmm. All right.

12:55.902 --> 12:58.104
Hey, we'll try to keep it down
out here. All right?

12:58.104 --> 13:00.240
Oh, that's fine.
I'll be leaving soon.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.242
Okay, well, I'll be back.

13:09.174 --> 13:11.176
Andi, I haven't heard
anything about Sabrina. Call me.

13:16.148 --> 13:18.216
Hi. How are you?

13:18.216 --> 13:20.218
I'm good. I'm good.

13:23.054 --> 13:24.256
Already started?

13:24.256 --> 13:27.626
Mm. Drinking? Yes.

13:30.595 --> 13:32.364
I'll have whatever
she's having.

13:32.364 --> 13:34.199
It's shots. It's brown liquor.

13:34.199 --> 13:35.367
Okay.

13:35.367 --> 13:36.568
I'm sorry. I'm just...

13:36.568 --> 13:38.437
I'm so stressed.

13:38.437 --> 13:39.905
I understand.

13:39.905 --> 13:42.908
Yeah, you know, like,
your kid and your girl and...

13:42.908 --> 13:46.077
Please don't mention her.

13:46.778 --> 13:48.046
Right! I'm messing.

13:48.046 --> 13:51.983
So, why are you
so stressed?

13:53.251 --> 13:55.720
That we're not going
to talk about that.

13:57.255 --> 13:58.457
Okay.

13:58.457 --> 14:00.158
Yeah, I just...

14:00.158 --> 14:04.963
I want to drink and smoke and
just forget about that stuff.

14:05.797 --> 14:07.332
I'm with that.

14:07.332 --> 14:09.301
You smoke?

14:09.301 --> 14:10.836
Are you kidding me?

14:10.836 --> 14:13.672
Okay. All right.
My kind of guy.

14:13.672 --> 14:15.040
Yeah?

14:15.040 --> 14:16.541
Mm-hmm.

14:17.309 --> 14:22.547
Yeah, so tell me
everything about yourself.

14:22.547 --> 14:25.917
Ooh.
Will you tell me about you?

14:27.219 --> 14:28.820
Absolutely.

14:29.654 --> 14:33.859
Well, I was born
a sharecropper's son.

14:37.395 --> 14:39.097
What? What?

14:40.565 --> 14:41.800
I'm kidding.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.134
Okay. Because I was like,

14:43.134 --> 14:44.970
"I don't know.
You got be at least 89."

14:44.970 --> 14:46.438
I mean, Black don't crack,
but...

14:46.438 --> 14:48.073
I'm sorry. I was just kidding.

14:48.874 --> 14:50.809
All right.
Well, how old are you?

14:51.643 --> 14:53.712
Thirty-four.

14:53.712 --> 14:55.180
So now I'm gonna
need to see ID.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.581
Thirty-eight.

14:56.581 --> 14:57.582
Okay, there was an "uh."
Yeah, see...

14:57.582 --> 14:58.750
Yeah, thirty... Yeah.

14:58.750 --> 14:59.951
Can I see some ID?

14:59.951 --> 15:02.420
Take it out of my pocket.

15:02.420 --> 15:03.622
What?

15:03.622 --> 15:05.357
It's in my front pocket.

15:08.026 --> 15:10.929
Oh. What kind of woman
do you think I am?

15:12.030 --> 15:14.199
The one who likes
to have a good time.

15:15.734 --> 15:17.469
That was so bad.

15:17.469 --> 15:19.604
Okay, my bad.

15:19.604 --> 15:22.040
Slow down.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.643
Well, usually when
I'm paying for the drinks,

15:24.643 --> 15:26.878
the night usually end up
with a little...

15:26.878 --> 15:28.280
A little ass?

15:28.280 --> 15:29.781
A lot of...

15:29.781 --> 15:33.485
You think because
you paid for some drinks,

15:33.485 --> 15:35.954
you going to get all this ass?
Have you...

15:36.855 --> 15:39.457
I mean, the drink-to-ass ratio
is off here, so...

15:40.692 --> 15:42.394
We'll see how
the night goes.

15:43.528 --> 15:45.096
Okay.

15:45.096 --> 15:47.232
Yeah, but I can tell you
now that ain't happening.

15:47.232 --> 15:50.101
All right.
I'm just saying. All right?

15:50.101 --> 15:52.037
There you go with that shit.

15:53.004 --> 15:54.973
Two more shots. Thanks.

15:56.775 --> 15:59.144
Might make it four more shots.

15:59.144 --> 16:02.080
I like where we're going.

16:03.715 --> 16:06.117
So, what else is going on?

16:06.117 --> 16:08.954
Well, I wanted you
to meet Zac but...

16:08.954 --> 16:10.889
Yeah, Zac. Where is Zac?

16:10.889 --> 16:12.290
He had to step out.

16:12.290 --> 16:13.692
He coming back?

16:13.692 --> 16:16.294
Yeah.
Yeah, he'll be back. Yeah.

16:16.294 --> 16:17.862
Cool.

16:17.862 --> 16:21.366
Well, Andi, she needs
some help with something,

16:21.366 --> 16:22.500
very much something...

16:22.500 --> 16:23.668
What?

16:23.668 --> 16:24.869
Just tell her what you need.

16:24.869 --> 16:26.271
No, don't, Andi.

16:26.271 --> 16:28.807
These favors
can be pretty costly.

16:28.807 --> 16:30.375
I told her that.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.743
Okay.

16:31.743 --> 16:33.745
What do you need?

16:33.745 --> 16:35.480
Tell her what
you need, girl.

16:36.681 --> 16:40.685
My friend

16:40.685 --> 16:43.588
was arrested for a bank robbery.

16:43.588 --> 16:45.991
-Damn.
-Oh, she's innocent.

16:45.991 --> 16:48.927
Wait. Are you talking
about Sabrina Hollins?

16:48.927 --> 16:50.829
Yeah. How did you know?

16:50.829 --> 16:52.364
Sweetheart,
I don't walk in a room

16:52.364 --> 16:57.002
and not know who the --
I'm dealing with. Go on.

16:57.002 --> 17:00.071
I'm having the hardest
time getting information

17:00.071 --> 17:03.642
on where she is
or what even happened.

17:03.642 --> 17:04.943
Okay.

17:04.943 --> 17:07.612
And I was hoping
you could help me.

17:08.947 --> 17:10.949
Wait. Is that all you need?

17:11.683 --> 17:13.351
Yes.

17:14.419 --> 17:16.755
Where's my purse?
Let me get my phone.

17:16.755 --> 17:18.456
I'll be
right back.

17:23.695 --> 17:25.664
She going to handle it.

17:25.664 --> 17:26.931
Handle it?

17:26.931 --> 17:28.533
Handle it.

17:28.533 --> 17:29.768
Okay, Fatima.

17:29.768 --> 17:31.536
-Hmm?
-We need to talk.

17:32.837 --> 17:35.306
-What?
-Your family...

17:36.474 --> 17:38.977
Look, girl, I already
told you what it is.

17:39.944 --> 17:41.813
She don't know
the half of it.

17:41.813 --> 17:43.715
-Half of what?
-Now, Marilyn...

17:43.715 --> 17:45.016
-Angela.
-Now, she...

17:45.016 --> 17:46.251
Really? Angela.

17:46.251 --> 17:47.619
I think she needs to know.

17:47.619 --> 17:48.753
-I think I do too.
-Enough.

17:48.753 --> 17:50.355
Tell me. Please tell me.

17:50.355 --> 17:54.893
-Now, Marilyn--
-Is in the family business...

17:54.893 --> 17:57.095
Okay. All right.

17:57.095 --> 17:59.764
I guess it runs in the blood.

17:59.764 --> 18:01.966
Mm-hmm.
Yes, honey. It does.

18:04.169 --> 18:06.838
Well, can she help Sabrina?

18:06.838 --> 18:08.673
Absolutely.

18:08.673 --> 18:10.108
Legally?

18:10.108 --> 18:11.810
Absolutely not.
Mm-mm. Won't be legal.

18:11.810 --> 18:13.278
Mm-mm.

18:13.278 --> 18:14.913
Don't ask no questions.
I'm telling you.

18:14.913 --> 18:16.147
What do you mean
it won't be legal?

18:16.147 --> 18:17.449
It won't be legal, friend.

18:17.449 --> 18:18.917
Mm-mm.
She'll get it done though.

18:18.917 --> 18:20.485
It will...
It'll be fine.

18:20.485 --> 18:22.520
All right.
So, she is in the county jail.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.990
They have her scheduled
to see the judge on Monday.

18:25.990 --> 18:28.093
But, you can call
this number right here,

18:28.093 --> 18:30.095
and they'll get you
to see her sooner.

18:30.095 --> 18:32.363
Also, she said something
about someone

18:32.363 --> 18:34.966
named Maurice Webb
having a recording

18:34.966 --> 18:37.769
and saying they were
both in on the robbery.

18:37.769 --> 18:40.538
Oh, what? Thank you so much.

18:40.538 --> 18:42.006
So, can I call her now?

18:42.006 --> 18:43.374
Mm-hmm.

18:43.374 --> 18:44.943
She'll get you in
to see her tomorrow.

18:44.943 --> 18:46.678
Awesome. Thank you!

18:46.678 --> 18:49.514
Mm-hmm.

18:49.514 --> 18:51.950
Madam, not to be nosy...

18:52.584 --> 18:54.552
What?

18:54.552 --> 18:56.121
Who is your contact?

18:56.121 --> 18:58.723
I was having the hardest time
getting any information,

18:58.723 --> 19:01.426
and you just...
boop.

19:02.293 --> 19:05.330
It's a judge,
and she likes -- one

19:05.330 --> 19:07.866
of the dancers at my club,

19:07.866 --> 19:10.435
and she does not like
to pay, so...

19:10.435 --> 19:13.738
Lucky me. I mean,
when I call her, she jumps.

19:13.738 --> 19:15.073
Okay.

19:15.073 --> 19:17.809
Yeah.
Got it on video and everything.

19:17.809 --> 19:19.043
Oh.

19:19.043 --> 19:21.379
She don't want
any of this

19:21.379 --> 19:22.413
Oh.

19:22.413 --> 19:24.349
Oh, oh, oh.
Why all the oh?

19:26.951 --> 19:28.653
Nothing.

19:30.555 --> 19:32.557
What's up, Fatima?
You didn't tell her?

19:32.557 --> 19:35.660
No, we didn't...
No, I didn't tell her.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.362
I tried to.

19:38.663 --> 19:41.099
Sweetheart,

19:41.099 --> 19:43.034
I'm a gangster,

19:43.034 --> 19:44.969
and I handle my shit.

19:44.969 --> 19:46.704
I see.

19:47.872 --> 19:50.141
So, what kind of lawyer are you?

19:50.141 --> 19:51.409
I'm a divorce attorney.

19:51.409 --> 19:52.677
Divorce?

19:52.677 --> 19:55.113
Shit, I can't do nothing
with a divorce lawyer.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.315
I need a criminal lawyer.

19:57.315 --> 20:00.585
Well, I know a lot
of criminal attorneys.

20:00.585 --> 20:04.455
Good. That's good.
I'ma hold you to that.

20:04.455 --> 20:07.659
Okay.

20:07.659 --> 20:11.296
Well, you know,
this has been very helpful.

20:11.296 --> 20:13.231
-Thanks so much!
-You're welcome.

20:13.231 --> 20:15.834
Look, if she does give you
any problems, let me know.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.569
I will.

20:19.504 --> 20:22.006
[phone ringing]
He's calling again.

20:22.006 --> 20:24.008
Oh. Something must be wrong.

20:24.008 --> 20:25.376
You might want to take this.

20:25.376 --> 20:26.878
If you ladies
will excuse me...

20:26.878 --> 20:28.012
Mm-hmm.

20:28.012 --> 20:31.082
Thank you. Excuse me.

20:42.894 --> 20:44.395
I like her.

20:44.395 --> 20:46.497
And this is how
you show you like someone?

20:47.232 --> 20:48.800
I'm just getting
to know the girl,

20:48.800 --> 20:50.435
but I like what I see so far.

20:51.836 --> 20:54.105
She is... She's a good boss.

20:54.105 --> 20:55.874
-She seems like it.
-Yeah.

20:55.874 --> 20:58.142
But, Fatima, girl,
you have no idea

20:58.142 --> 20:59.510
how much money
you could be making

20:59.510 --> 21:02.113
if you came back
and ran the club for me, girl.

21:03.114 --> 21:05.450
Look, I'm good on all that.

21:05.450 --> 21:09.254
Okay. Well, back to
the task at hand, your man.

21:09.254 --> 21:10.855
Let's get back
to that conversation.

21:10.855 --> 21:12.257
I don't think we were done.

21:12.257 --> 21:13.591
Yeah, let's get back
to the man.

21:13.591 --> 21:15.093
Really?

21:15.093 --> 21:16.828
-Were we? No.
-I was done.

21:16.828 --> 21:19.063
Mm-mm. I don't think so.

21:19.063 --> 21:20.598
Go ahead. Tell her.

21:20.598 --> 21:24.435
Okay.
Look, her mother called today

21:24.435 --> 21:26.004
and asked him to come over
to talk to her.

21:26.004 --> 21:27.472
Mm! Now, you believe that shit?

21:27.472 --> 21:29.440
Because when I heard it,
I didn't believe it.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.476
I thought, "No way.
Ain't no way."

21:31.476 --> 21:34.078
Oh, but that's not it.
Keep going. Keep going.

21:34.078 --> 21:36.714
-Damn!
-Get to it. Finish your story.

21:37.282 --> 21:39.050
They invited me too.

21:39.050 --> 21:40.084
Mm.

21:40.084 --> 21:41.319
To go over there?

21:41.319 --> 21:42.921
-Yes.
-Uh-huh.

21:42.921 --> 21:44.422
All right.
Well, then let's go.

21:44.422 --> 21:47.158
No. Nope.
We are not going over there.

21:47.158 --> 21:49.227
-Why not?
-Why?

21:49.227 --> 21:50.962
Because...

21:50.962 --> 21:52.463
Mm-mm.

21:52.463 --> 21:54.365
Yeah, no.

21:54.365 --> 21:56.167
Don't go.
Why would you go over there?

21:56.167 --> 21:58.002
Tima, you need to go
over there, Fatima.

21:58.002 --> 21:59.437
-Why?
-Right, why?

21:59.437 --> 22:02.040
Because you need
to set her ass straight.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.374
Listen.

22:03.374 --> 22:05.343
Oh, I mean, she's pregnant.

22:07.929 --> 22:09.631
Yes, sir?

22:10.699 --> 22:12.234
I was wrong.

22:12.234 --> 22:14.636
I'm sorry. Is there
a problem at work, sir?

22:15.737 --> 22:18.073
Andi, can I just
tell you what happened?

22:18.073 --> 22:19.908
Is there a client
that's unhappy?

22:21.309 --> 22:23.678
-So you just want to...
-Talk about work.

22:24.646 --> 22:26.281
I deserve that.

22:26.281 --> 22:28.183
So, if it's not about work,

22:28.183 --> 22:29.718
you don't need to call me.

22:29.718 --> 22:31.987
I'm going to be at
the Steam Plant, okay?

22:31.987 --> 22:33.622
This is not about work.

22:33.622 --> 22:34.890
Andi, let me...

22:34.890 --> 22:36.591
Good night.

22:48.737 --> 22:51.072
Hi!

22:51.072 --> 22:52.807
How the hell did you
get back in here?

22:52.807 --> 22:55.377
How was a lock supposed
to stop a gangster?

22:56.311 --> 22:57.846
You are something else,
you know that?

22:57.846 --> 22:59.314
Mm-hmm.

22:59.314 --> 23:00.849
God, you are such...

23:00.849 --> 23:03.752
-What?
-...a grimy --!

23:03.752 --> 23:05.353
Whatever, man.

23:05.353 --> 23:07.355
I don't know how you
could live with yourself.

23:07.355 --> 23:10.558
Like this! It's nice.
This how I live.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.795
Well, you need to go.

23:13.795 --> 23:15.130
I'm not going nowhere.

23:15.130 --> 23:17.365
I'm telling you,
your ass needs to go.

23:17.365 --> 23:18.633
Who the hell you think
you talking to?

23:18.633 --> 23:22.203
I already beat
your ass once, Que.

23:22.203 --> 23:23.571
That was a blouse thing.

23:23.571 --> 23:25.240
What the hell
are you talking about?

23:25.240 --> 23:26.675
Boy, you were
fighting in a blouse.

23:26.675 --> 23:29.878
I'ma beat your ass.
I'm a thug, Calvin.

23:29.878 --> 23:31.146
--, I can
tell you a thug.

23:31.146 --> 23:33.481
Look at your elbows,
ashy as shit.

23:33.481 --> 23:34.916
Let me tell you
something, Calvin.

23:34.916 --> 23:37.686
I'm not in the mood
for this shit today.

23:37.686 --> 23:39.688
Who the hell
do you think you are?

23:46.328 --> 23:48.596
I'm that --.
Keep it up.

23:48.596 --> 23:51.099
I'm going to give you
what you want.

23:51.099 --> 23:52.734
You didn't know, Calvin?

23:52.734 --> 23:55.236
I've been peeping you been
looking at me around here.

23:55.236 --> 23:56.805
You done lost
your damn mind.

23:56.805 --> 23:59.741
Come on, man!
You want to get -- down,

23:59.741 --> 24:02.210
and I've got you,
but you got to chill out.

24:02.210 --> 24:03.678
--, you better watch
who you're talking to.

24:03.678 --> 24:05.747
You better...
go get that vibrator.

24:06.948 --> 24:08.650
You know what?

24:08.650 --> 24:10.785
You always saying shit,
but you ain't doing anything.

24:10.785 --> 24:11.953
Keep pushing me!

24:11.953 --> 24:13.655
I heard about your
little twirl and fall

24:13.655 --> 24:18.693
after you got hit in the bank.
You really flexible.

24:18.693 --> 24:20.829
You know what?

24:20.829 --> 24:23.565
Let me ask you something,
Calvin?

24:23.565 --> 24:25.633
Why you keep messing
with that vibrator?

24:25.633 --> 24:27.268
All them thousands
and thousands of dollars

24:27.268 --> 24:29.704
you spend on batteries,

24:29.704 --> 24:31.506
why don't you
just give it to me?

24:31.506 --> 24:33.908
I can go way longer
than that -- bunny.

24:41.850 --> 24:43.051
You know what, Que?

24:43.051 --> 24:44.219
Hmm?

24:44.219 --> 24:45.787
You're right.

24:45.787 --> 24:48.690
I know I am because
Maurice told me everything.

24:50.225 --> 24:52.894
-Okay.
-Where you going?

24:52.894 --> 24:54.429
-- you!

24:54.429 --> 24:57.332
Ouch. Bet I really know
what you mean though.

24:58.633 --> 25:01.603
Don't walk away from me,
but please walk away from me.

25:04.472 --> 25:07.275
If you do not go
and check her ass,

25:07.275 --> 25:09.477
then she will continue
to be a problem.

25:10.345 --> 25:11.780
That's true. She right.

25:11.780 --> 25:13.481
I know I'm right.

25:14.549 --> 25:17.852
I know.
But I'm not going over there.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.856
Fine then. Let the bitch
continue to be a problem.

25:23.258 --> 25:24.392
Hey. You good?

25:24.392 --> 25:27.595
Yeah.

25:27.595 --> 25:30.031
I just told him not to contact
me unless it involved work.

25:31.032 --> 25:32.834
-Good.
-So, yeah.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.102
Mm-hmm.

25:34.102 --> 25:36.037
I'm going to head home now.

25:36.037 --> 25:38.306
Thank you so much, Madam.

25:38.306 --> 25:39.474
Sure.

25:39.474 --> 25:40.842
Thank you, Fatima.

25:40.842 --> 25:42.143
Mm-hmm. Of course.

25:42.143 --> 25:43.478
It was very nice meeting you.

25:43.478 --> 25:44.646
It was nice meeting you too.

25:44.646 --> 25:46.047
I'll be watching you
in the office.

25:46.047 --> 25:49.350
Okay. I'm going to go now.

25:49.350 --> 25:51.086
-All right.
-Thanks again.

25:51.086 --> 25:52.353
-Ciao.
-See you later.

25:52.353 --> 25:54.489
-Bye.
-Bye, girl.

25:58.293 --> 25:59.994
No!

26:04.532 --> 26:06.301
Now, you know she about
to go see him.

26:06.301 --> 26:07.735
Right now.

26:07.735 --> 26:08.970
Mm-hmm.

26:08.970 --> 26:10.738
Mm, I don't think she is.

26:10.738 --> 26:12.841
Not... Girl, please.
She about to go -- that man.

26:12.841 --> 26:14.309
-I think she right.
-Can we not?

26:14.309 --> 26:17.045
-I know I'm right.
-Can we not?

26:17.045 --> 26:18.980
No, we don't have
to talk about her. She gone.

26:18.980 --> 26:20.849
Let's talk about you
and your man.

26:20.849 --> 26:22.851
You know what?
Actually, we can stay on her.

26:22.851 --> 26:23.685
-Mm-mm.
-No.

26:23.685 --> 26:24.853
Yeah, I liked that a lot.

26:24.853 --> 26:26.121
-No.
-We can talk about...

26:26.121 --> 26:27.522
Where is he?
What is going on?

26:27.522 --> 26:28.456
[phone ringing]

26:28.456 --> 26:30.258
Speaking of...

26:30.258 --> 26:31.593
That's him?

26:31.593 --> 26:32.827
-Yes, it is.
-Answer it.

26:32.827 --> 26:35.396
-Answer it!
-I am. I am!

26:35.396 --> 26:37.065
Hi!
I want to meet you, Zac!

26:37.065 --> 26:39.367
You will meet him.

26:39.367 --> 26:41.035
Yeah, I'm still here.

26:41.035 --> 26:42.604
Okay. And how's it going?

26:42.604 --> 26:44.606
She blamed me
for everything.

26:44.606 --> 26:46.708
What kind of exercise
is this?

26:46.708 --> 26:48.843
I don't know.
It's her mother's idea.

26:50.078 --> 26:52.347
Okay. So how long?

26:52.347 --> 26:53.715
I don't know.

26:53.715 --> 26:56.684
She got all emotional
and had to take a break.

26:57.619 --> 26:59.721
Well, that sounds intense.

26:59.721 --> 27:01.256
Look, I'm going to
give her 20 minutes,

27:01.256 --> 27:02.390
and I'm out of here.

27:02.390 --> 27:03.892
All right.

27:03.892 --> 27:05.460
As long as you do
what you're supposed to do.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.595
Mm. I'll see you
when I get home.

27:11.065 --> 27:14.302
[loud bassy music]

27:14.302 --> 27:15.403
Who is that?

27:15.403 --> 27:17.238
That damn girl.

27:17.238 --> 27:18.439
Who?

27:18.439 --> 27:22.911
Zac's new tenant
that he let move in.

27:22.911 --> 27:24.579
Oh, no, Tima.
He needs to handle that.

27:24.579 --> 27:27.182
I tell her all the time
to turn the damn music down,

27:27.182 --> 27:30.485
and I got it.
I got it.

27:30.485 --> 27:32.787
Sweetheart,
you hear this? You don't got it.

27:32.787 --> 27:34.722
I can tell you don't have it.

27:38.293 --> 27:40.828
You know what?
On second thought...

27:40.828 --> 27:42.263
-Exactly.
-...let's go.

27:42.263 --> 27:44.232
Ooh, yay!

27:47.101 --> 27:49.103
Mm-hmm. After you,
your house. Lead the way.

27:54.852 --> 27:56.587
You know she does
this shit all the time

27:56.587 --> 27:58.222
just so Zac will call her?

27:58.222 --> 27:59.857
Oh, really?

28:00.824 --> 28:02.826
Go knock on that bitch's door.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.843
Wipe that damn smile
off your face. It's just me.

28:19.843 --> 28:21.111
Oh.

28:21.111 --> 28:22.713
Why is she smiling anyway?

28:22.713 --> 28:24.982
She turns her music up
so that Zac will come over here.

28:24.982 --> 28:27.217
Okay. Look, I'm sorry.
I'll turn my music down.

28:27.217 --> 28:30.120
I was just getting ready
for work. It's no pressure.

28:30.754 --> 28:34.057
And where do you work at?

28:34.057 --> 28:35.926
Oh, baby.

28:35.926 --> 28:38.996
Look at this body.
Take a good look at it.

28:38.996 --> 28:41.532
She'll tell you.
It's going to cost you though.

28:42.399 --> 28:44.802
Oh, okay.

28:44.802 --> 28:47.137
Yeah, it's very much
giving Thots 'R' Us.

28:47.137 --> 28:49.306
I let you close
my damn hand in that locker,

28:49.306 --> 28:51.375
and I didn't press charges
on your ass the first time.

28:51.375 --> 28:52.776
I'm sorry.
What did she just say?

28:52.776 --> 28:54.044
Yeah, you heard
what the -- I said.

28:54.044 --> 28:55.546
Y'all came over here
acting real big and bold

28:55.546 --> 28:56.947
like you going to do shit
in front of my

28:56.947 --> 28:58.549
-mother-- door step.
-Uh-huh.

28:58.549 --> 29:00.217
If you want me to shut up,
then make me shut up.

29:00.217 --> 29:01.752
-Y'all I'm sick of your--
-Go on. Keep talking.

29:01.752 --> 29:03.253
No, I'm sick of y'all
always coming to my house,

29:03.253 --> 29:06.523
harassing me when I pay rent,
and your man know I pay rent,

29:06.523 --> 29:08.125
and you always

29:08.125 --> 29:10.127

to be messing with y'all

29:10.127 --> 29:12.696
and y'all little lawyer...
Y'all think y'all so classy

29:12.696 --> 29:14.131
because y'all be wearing
shit like that.

29:14.131 --> 29:16.700
Hold on. Y'all always want
to run up on me when I'm--

29:17.734 --> 29:19.970
Yeah. Talk that shit now.

29:19.970 --> 29:21.238
Madam?

29:21.238 --> 29:22.940
The one and only.

29:24.374 --> 29:27.544
No, finish saying what the --
you was about to say.

29:29.246 --> 29:32.049
No, go ahead. Tell her
what you was about to say.

29:35.152 --> 29:39.957
I'm sorry.
How do y'all know each other?

29:41.425 --> 29:43.160
That's my cousin.

29:46.463 --> 29:48.532
Oh. Oh.

29:48.532 --> 29:50.434
Oh, I am so sorry.
I was... I wasn't even...

29:50.434 --> 29:51.668
How do you know me?

29:51.668 --> 29:52.803
I got Tourette's.

29:52.803 --> 29:55.172
How do you know me?

29:56.373 --> 29:57.574
I'm a dancer, Madam.

29:57.574 --> 29:59.576
Oh, okay.

29:59.576 --> 30:01.712
So, then that means
you know my reputation.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.814
Yeah, I mean,
I've heard some things.

30:04.615 --> 30:06.750
Oh, you heard some things.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.152
Oh, this should be fun.
What have you heard?

30:10.554 --> 30:12.322
What you want to know
exactly?

30:12.322 --> 30:14.725
What have you heard?
You've heard things, right?

30:14.725 --> 30:16.460
I heard that
you don't play.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.661
I heard that you don't play.

30:17.661 --> 30:19.963
That's all I heard.
That's all I know.

30:19.963 --> 30:21.932
You heard correct. I don't play.

30:21.932 --> 30:23.500
I don't play about my money,

30:23.500 --> 30:25.168
and I don't play about
my -- blood.

30:25.168 --> 30:27.437
And, the one you
messing with right now...

30:27.437 --> 30:29.106
That's your blood?

30:29.106 --> 30:31.108
Yeah, that's my blood,
baby. You feeling me now.

30:31.108 --> 30:32.876
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

30:35.479 --> 30:37.014
I was just playing with her.

30:37.014 --> 30:39.583
I was practicing
for this new audition and...

30:39.583 --> 30:42.019
Bitch, apologize
to my cousin.

30:42.786 --> 30:44.121
I'm sorry, sis.

30:44.121 --> 30:45.856
Sincere-er.

30:46.623 --> 30:47.858
Tima...

30:47.858 --> 30:49.459
Bitch,
don't call me that.

30:49.459 --> 30:53.096
Fatima, I apologize.
Okay?

30:56.166 --> 30:58.235
I had been arguing
with somebody earlier,

30:58.235 --> 30:59.803
and you got the tail-end,

30:59.803 --> 31:01.905
and that wasn't for you
and your beautiful friends.

31:01.905 --> 31:03.473
I didn't mean none of that.

31:03.473 --> 31:05.642
Yeah, I like the way
she talking now.

31:05.642 --> 31:07.344
-I'm sorry.
-Uh-huh.

31:07.344 --> 31:09.446
I'm...
I apologize. I'm cool.

31:09.446 --> 31:10.714
You cool?

31:10.714 --> 31:13.016
Yeah. We good?

31:13.016 --> 31:14.885
I don't want to have
to come back over here

31:14.885 --> 31:17.120
and have a conversation
with you again. Are we clear?

31:17.120 --> 31:19.589
Yes. Yeah. Me neither.
Me neither. I...

31:19.589 --> 31:21.224
Good.

31:21.224 --> 31:25.195
So, if Fatima tells me anything
about you flirting with her man,

31:25.195 --> 31:28.098
if she tells me anything about
you playing your music loud...

31:28.098 --> 31:29.666
I just...

31:29.666 --> 31:31.902
Ah. I won't be back,
but I will send someone.

31:33.236 --> 31:35.672
And I don't know what size
your speakers are in there.

31:35.672 --> 31:38.208
I don't give a --
because it will be a coffin.

31:39.409 --> 31:41.511
Now, you feel me for real?

31:41.511 --> 31:42.846
Yes, Madam.

31:42.846 --> 31:44.881
Well, good. Have a good night.

31:44.881 --> 31:46.249
Y'all have a good night.

31:46.249 --> 31:47.684
Mm-hmm. Bye.

31:47.684 --> 31:49.686
That color really
brings out your eyes.

31:50.654 --> 31:55.192
And, you look nice too
and you too. Okay.

31:55.192 --> 31:56.626
Have a good night.

31:56.626 --> 31:58.295
You have a better one!

32:01.398 --> 32:03.300
All right. Y'all ready
to finish these drinks?

32:03.300 --> 32:04.568
Mm-hmm!

32:04.568 --> 32:06.003
-Yes.
-Let's do it.

32:06.003 --> 32:07.404
That was fun.
We should do that more often.

32:07.404 --> 32:09.106
Girl.

32:16.913 --> 32:19.816
So, this is my home.

32:21.218 --> 32:22.486
Nice.

32:22.486 --> 32:24.154
Okay. Thank you.

32:26.390 --> 32:28.091
So, where is the bedroom?

32:29.059 --> 32:32.529
-You know what?
-What?

32:32.529 --> 32:33.830
You trying to get me
into the bed,

32:33.830 --> 32:35.732
and we just walked in the door?

32:35.732 --> 32:37.768
Isn't that what we're here for?

32:38.902 --> 32:41.038
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

32:42.205 --> 32:43.673
I see.

32:43.673 --> 32:46.209
Thank you. We are going
at my pace, okay?

32:46.209 --> 32:47.377
Okay.

32:47.377 --> 32:50.447
I got it. So you got
anything else to drink?

32:50.447 --> 32:53.083
Yeah, sure.

32:57.821 --> 32:58.955
-Straight, no chaser.
-Right. No chaser.

32:58.955 --> 33:00.323
You want brown or white?

33:00.323 --> 33:01.558
-Brown.
-Brown.

33:01.558 --> 33:03.060
Thanks.

33:03.060 --> 33:04.361
Good. Because
if you'd have said white,

33:04.361 --> 33:05.796
I don't know what I'd do.

33:05.796 --> 33:09.533
Well, I only
take my white [Indistinct]

33:09.533 --> 33:12.702
What? Oh, gosh.

33:12.702 --> 33:18.375
Oh, it's a good one.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.043
So, what is this?

33:20.777 --> 33:22.512
What do you mean?

33:25.415 --> 33:27.150
We're here. You got me here.

33:28.552 --> 33:33.857
You're beautiful,
and we're drunk.

33:35.792 --> 33:38.361
And high.

33:38.361 --> 33:40.063
And high!

33:42.199 --> 33:45.102
I know we're just meeting,
but I'm single.

33:45.102 --> 33:48.205
You're single.
What's the deal?

33:50.907 --> 33:52.809
You want honesty?

33:55.545 --> 33:57.280
Yes.

33:58.148 --> 33:59.716
Well, I'm not a ho, right?

33:59.716 --> 34:00.951
I never said that.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.719
You didn't. You didn't.

34:02.719 --> 34:05.589
I'm prefacing what I'm about to
say because it may contradict.

34:06.556 --> 34:09.092
I also want to try having
a hot girl summer.

34:10.527 --> 34:11.995
I don't know
what that means.

34:11.995 --> 34:15.799
Well, it's just
when you rotate them.

34:15.799 --> 34:17.367
I don't know
what you're saying.

34:17.367 --> 34:20.203
Yes, you do.
You know what I'm talking about.

34:20.203 --> 34:23.406
Just rotating my men
like y'all do with your women.

34:24.374 --> 34:25.542
Me?

34:25.542 --> 34:27.310
Sure, yeah, you.

34:27.310 --> 34:30.280
Because if a man does it,
he's just being a man.

34:30.280 --> 34:35.285
If a woman does it,
she's a whole ho, but I digress.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.089
I just want to enjoy myself,
you know?

34:39.923 --> 34:43.126
Have fun. Be free. Just be!

34:45.362 --> 34:46.796
I get it. Okay.

34:46.796 --> 34:48.331
So, that's why you're here.

34:48.331 --> 34:49.566
Okay.

34:49.566 --> 34:50.734
If I want to do this, we will.

34:50.734 --> 34:53.003
But if I don't, we won't.

34:53.970 --> 34:55.906
I don't get a say in this?

34:56.940 --> 34:58.842
In what I do with my body?

34:58.842 --> 35:01.611
Yeah, yeah, no.
No. No.

35:01.611 --> 35:03.680
It's my body too.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.749
You meant your body.

35:05.749 --> 35:07.884
Yeah, still no.
You don't get a count.

35:08.885 --> 35:10.854
Damn.
I'm kidding.

35:12.122 --> 35:13.924
-You better be.
-I'm not kidding.

35:15.125 --> 35:16.393
What do you
look like under there,

35:16.393 --> 35:18.962
since you want
to just get to it.

35:18.962 --> 35:21.231
Well, we got
some flowers and...

35:22.232 --> 35:23.600
What do you look like
under there?

35:23.600 --> 35:27.504
A man should not
describe his body as flowerly.

35:31.007 --> 35:32.776
I'm a gentle, delicate rose.

35:32.776 --> 35:34.578
What do you
look like under there?

35:35.712 --> 35:37.013
What do you look like
under there?

35:37.013 --> 35:38.648
No, no, no. I asked you first,

35:38.648 --> 35:40.917
and you can kind of already see
what you're working with.

35:40.917 --> 35:43.220
You show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

35:50.594 --> 35:51.595
Come here.

36:09.579 --> 36:11.748
What's the matter?
What happened? Why did you stop?

36:11.748 --> 36:13.516
I was so close.

36:13.516 --> 36:15.552
Close to what?

36:15.552 --> 36:16.820
You know.

36:16.820 --> 36:18.288
I don't.

36:18.288 --> 36:20.390
No, no, seriously.
What's the matter.

36:21.558 --> 36:23.260
Nothing. Nothing.

36:28.898 --> 36:30.166
Are you sure?

36:30.166 --> 36:31.568
You know... yeah...

36:31.568 --> 36:34.938
I don't think I want
to do this anymore.

36:34.938 --> 36:36.706
You had fun, right, so...

36:36.706 --> 36:38.675
Oh, shit.

36:38.675 --> 36:40.377
What?

36:46.816 --> 36:48.218
I'll get there,
I promise.

36:48.218 --> 36:49.719
You know,
you had a lot to drink,

36:49.719 --> 36:51.621
a little whiskey dick.
You got a long way to go.

36:51.621 --> 36:55.292
Shh, shh, shh.

36:55.292 --> 36:56.960
How about
I just show you what I can do?

37:10.657 --> 37:13.260
Voicemail. Hmm.

37:20.967 --> 37:23.470
[phone ringing]

37:23.470 --> 37:25.205
Hey! What's up?

37:25.906 --> 37:27.774
What are you doing?

37:27.774 --> 37:29.442
[Danni]<i> Nothing.</i>

37:31.244 --> 37:33.246
Sounds like you're
doing something.

37:33.246 --> 37:35.115
No. No, no, no. What is it?

37:35.115 --> 37:37.717
Well, Fatima's cousin
worked it all out.

37:38.385 --> 37:40.120
I don't know what that means.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.222
It means I get
to see Sabrina tomorrow.

37:42.222 --> 37:44.524
Oh, okay. Well, I'm coming too.

37:45.258 --> 37:47.327
I'm coming too. Okay?

37:48.528 --> 37:52.532
Danni, only legal counsel
can see Sabrina, so...

37:52.532 --> 37:56.403
Andi, you tell them I'm
your law assistant or something.

37:56.403 --> 37:57.904
Okay, Danni.

37:57.904 --> 38:00.407
What?
I'm going to see Sabrina.

38:01.808 --> 38:03.043
Okay.

38:03.043 --> 38:04.444
Baby, come on.

38:04.444 --> 38:06.279
Just shh, shh!

38:06.279 --> 38:10.216
-Uh-uh. Who was that?
-I got to go.

38:10.216 --> 38:12.319
What are you doing?

38:12.319 --> 38:13.687
Goodbye.

38:13.687 --> 38:14.821
Tell him I said, "Hello."

38:14.821 --> 38:16.556
-[Danni]<i> Bye</i> .
-Mm-hmm.

38:26.633 --> 38:28.735
[Paris]<i> Hey, Andi,
this is Paris.</i>

38:29.703 --> 38:31.338
<i>I just wanted
to give you a heads up.</i>

38:31.338 --> 38:34.140
<i>This guy, Robin,
is asking me a lot about you.</i>

38:34.140 --> 38:35.875
<i>Just wanted you to know.</i>

38:35.875 --> 38:37.610
What?

38:46.086 --> 38:47.587
[Paris]<i> Hey.</i>

38:47.587 --> 38:48.822
Hey.

38:48.822 --> 38:50.557
Long time no hear.

38:51.658 --> 38:53.693
Yeah.

38:53.693 --> 38:55.729
How are you?

38:55.729 --> 38:56.930
I'm good.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.264
Well, that's great.

38:58.264 --> 39:00.734
So, I got your voicemail.

39:02.168 --> 39:05.071
Yeah. So, no small talk?

39:06.639 --> 39:09.042
I'm sorry.
It's just been a long day.

39:09.776 --> 39:11.978
I get it. It's all good.

39:11.978 --> 39:13.446
So...

39:13.446 --> 39:15.181
Yeah, so I was just
cleaning up the offices,

39:15.181 --> 39:17.250
and then he randomly
just starts asking me

39:17.250 --> 39:20.286
if I knew you
and if I had dated you.

39:22.155 --> 39:24.090
And, what'd you say?

39:24.090 --> 39:25.925
Shit, I didn't
tell that man nothing.

39:25.925 --> 39:27.627
Only that I knew you from here.

39:28.762 --> 39:30.630
I see.

39:30.630 --> 39:32.298
It wasn't cool though.

39:32.298 --> 39:34.868
No, it's not cool.

39:34.868 --> 39:37.704
And, I have no idea
what he was trying to get at.

39:39.906 --> 39:41.541
I don't either.

39:42.375 --> 39:46.379
Well, it felt off,
and I thought you should know.

39:48.014 --> 39:49.916
Well, thank you.

39:49.916 --> 39:53.420
Well, you have a good night.

39:55.488 --> 39:57.824
Goodnight.

40:01.161 --> 40:03.229
What the hell are you up to?

40:10.203 --> 40:11.771
Are you okay, baby?

40:11.771 --> 40:13.106
Yeah.

40:13.106 --> 40:17.143
Oh, sweetie.
You want to continue?

40:20.080 --> 40:21.314
Yes.

40:21.314 --> 40:24.818
Okay. Come on.

40:35.161 --> 40:36.296
Okay.

40:36.296 --> 40:39.899
Okay. She's ready. Aaron.

40:44.404 --> 40:46.906
You sit there?
Zac.

40:47.841 --> 40:49.476
So, it's my turn now?

40:49.476 --> 40:54.914
Yeah, it's your turn.
Okay. You ready, baby?

40:57.150 --> 40:59.519
First off, I want to say

40:59.519 --> 41:01.921
that this is not
a personal attack on you.

41:03.189 --> 41:06.192
It's just--
[knocking on door]

41:06.192 --> 41:08.161
All right.
Well, who's that?

41:08.161 --> 41:09.395
I don't know.

41:09.395 --> 41:11.931
-I can get it.
-No, no. I'll get it.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.037
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:18.037 --> 41:20.140
I'm looking for Zac.

41:20.140 --> 41:22.542
I'm Fatima.

41:26.679 --> 41:31.084
But, now with this baby,
you might always be in my life,

41:31.084 --> 41:32.552
and I don't know
if I can do that.

They said he out here
fronting like he big shit.

41:39.192 --> 41:40.693
Well, that's good to know.

41:40.693 --> 41:43.963
Karen was investing you
on a much larger return,

41:43.963 --> 41:45.465
the one that
I'm getting right now.

41:45.465 --> 41:48.001
I don't know
what's going on with me.

to get married"?
