17:46.364 --> 17:50.204
that they were using the flat of
a British MP to set up a drugs deal.

17:50.364 --> 17:53.924
And the twist is the heroin
wasn't being offered for cash.

It's not him. I just...

18:06.044 --> 18:07.964

He had a gun.

18:08.124 --> 18:10.484
And he used it to save my daughter.
Who in her debrief

18:10.644 --> 18:12.964

by that name.

18:22.804 --> 18:24.764

Now he is between a rock
and a hard place.

and chooses the rock

by which he gives up everything
he knows about Toni Lulin

the Chinese operating the Balkans.

18:53.724 --> 18:56.404

32:42.545 --> 32:45.345
Change of sleeping plans.

32:45.505 --> 32:49.585
We're gonna make like
those times in Nairn.

32:49.705 --> 32:51.705
Do you remember that?

32:51.825 --> 32:53.785
Remember those holidays?

32:55.665 --> 32:58.065
You were about four years old...

32:59.145 --> 33:01.585
..and got lost on the beach

33:01.745 --> 33:03.625
and you were crying because
you couldn't find us

33:03.785 --> 33:05.785
and we were there the whole time.
We were right there.

33:05.945 --> 33:08.585
We were right beside you.
(SNIFFLES)

33:08.745 --> 33:11.225
And we had digestive biscuits
for breakfast...

33:12.665 --> 33:14.625
..from a red packet.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.945
It was just the three of us
in that one room.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.025
You remember that?

33:21.145 --> 33:23.505
Because I remember that.

33:23.665 --> 33:26.385
They were the happiest days
of my life.

33:35.065 --> 33:38.505
We're here for you, sweetheart.
There's nobody but us now.

33:45.945 --> 33:47.905
(CRIES GENTLY)

34:24.880 --> 34:25.040
You're quite right.
Are you going to make a move Archie?

34:26.440 --> 34:30.360
I literally cannot wait until I see
her smug little face again.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.400
(CHUCKLES)

34:35.159 --> 34:37.120
(DOOR OPENS)

34:39.679 --> 34:42.000
Thank you so much for coming,
Dominic.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.639
I felt it was important
that we cleared the air.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.679
Thank you, Prime Minister.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.400
Now, I assume you're aware

34:49.520 --> 34:51.440
that your return to Number 10

34:51.600 --> 34:54.080
was contingent upon
Archie supporting me

34:54.239 --> 34:56.440
in the forthcoming confidence vote.
Well, not in so many...

34:56.600 --> 34:58.760
Of course he knows.
Of course he does.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.040
It works for everyone, doesn't it?

35:01.200 --> 35:04.400
No-one is irreplaceable.
An excellent summary.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.440
Good. Coffee's here.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.680
How do you take yours, Dominic?

35:12.800 --> 35:14.840
White, no sugar.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.320
Do you?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.680
(SPOON STIRRING)

35:27.040 --> 35:29.000
(STIRRING CONTINUES)

35:32.320 --> 35:34.280
Do you, indeed?

35:39.720 --> 35:42.080
I don't understand.
He brought us all the way here

35:42.240 --> 35:44.600
just to tell us to go
fuck ourselves.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.880
An excellent summary.
Better call the removal men, Robert.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.960
You can bring me down, Archie.
But you will never take my place.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.120
You've always tried
to exploit this crisis

35:54.280 --> 35:57.480
for your own shitty ends, not caring
who gets hurt along the way.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.720
And that is the worst kind
of politician in my book.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.000
So if you two want coffee,

36:03.160 --> 36:05.440
you can leave by the door
you came through

36:05.560 --> 36:07.720
and fuck off to Starbucks.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.600
FRASER: OK, we're ready
to give this a go.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.960
But this is a first test, OK?

36:46.080 --> 36:48.440
I'm not promising anything.

36:48.560 --> 36:50.480
OK, stand by.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.320
You OK?

36:59.440 --> 37:01.360
I'm fine.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.720
Eleanor James says you're going
to sack me to save your career.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.240
I'm not.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.240
That's what I thought.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.040
Make Parminder Home Secretary.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.120
That's what I thought.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.880
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

37:31.600 --> 37:33.560
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

37:43.040 --> 37:45.640
JAMES: I think it's too soon.
The data isn't clear enough.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.880
I should have given them more time.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.880
I've rushed this.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.920
They needed to run the final tests.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.000
Oh, God.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.680
Oh.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.800
Er... Wha...

38:15.920 --> 38:18.160
Is it... Are the police coming?

38:19.400 --> 38:21.360
What did he say?

38:22.640 --> 38:25.960
OK, things are going to be
a bit wobbly at first,

38:26.120 --> 38:28.840
but, ladies and gentlemen,
I am pleased to report

38:29.000 --> 38:31.600
that power to the Red Zone
has just been restored.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.160
(CHEERING)

38:34.280 --> 38:36.200
(APPLAUSE)

38:36.320 --> 38:38.240
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

38:43.600 --> 38:46.160
You did it, Fraser!
You fucking did it.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.600
You put the lights back on!

38:48.760 --> 38:51.680
You kept your promise.
Yes, I did.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.800
I don't care about the confidence
vote anymore.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.160
This is all that matters.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.240
(LAUGHS)

39:05.360 --> 39:07.280
Fuck off to Starbucks?

39:07.440 --> 39:09.600
Well, I would have been
Prime Minister in name only.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.480
And he would have made sure
everyone knew it.

39:12.640 --> 39:16.000
Plus, there's your undying
loyalty to me.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.040
Well, there's that, obviously.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.800
Do you know what would be handy?

39:21.920 --> 39:24.000
If you could dig up a tape of Archie,

39:24.160 --> 39:26.400
in a brothel,
dressed as an SS officer.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.440
He'd probably put that on Instagram.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.880
Yeah, should be something he'd be
ashamed of, I guess. (CHUCKLES)

39:36.440 --> 39:39.200
Lights back on,
he thinks it's all over.

39:39.360 --> 39:42.120
Don't look now but his numbers
are steadily climbing.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.520
Let's see what happens when
it's proved he lied to parliament,

39:45.680 --> 39:48.440
and his wife thinks
she can escape justice

39:48.560 --> 39:50.480
because she is rich and white.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.920
Your strategy for getting
rid of Anna Marshall

39:53.040 --> 39:55.040
didn't go so well, did it?

39:57.160 --> 39:59.800
Plan B then.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.720
Run it past me,
just for my amusement.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.200
Ensure the tabloids know
she likes cavorting

40:06.360 --> 40:09.200
with drug dealers and assassins.
Not an option, don't go there.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.000
Why the hell have you always
got her back?

40:12.120 --> 40:14.880
Because she is a graceful soprano

40:15.000 --> 40:17.760
in a world of hairy-arsed baritones.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.160
Pure as a little bell.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.200
Unlike me you mean.

40:22.320 --> 40:25.040
Oh, Archie, I love you dearly,

40:25.200 --> 40:27.800
but you're as pure
as my dog's bowels

40:27.960 --> 40:30.600
after it devoured the Christmas
cheese selection.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.160
Now, while Team Sutherland

40:33.320 --> 40:35.400
don't know where the bodies
are buried I certainly do,

40:35.560 --> 40:38.440
so the question I'd be asking
myself right now is this -

40:38.560 --> 40:40.840
do I want to fall out with Eleanor?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.160
I hear they're lining up
Parminder Haigh to replace you.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.600
Course they bloody are.

40:47.760 --> 40:50.480
Well, I hope she enjoys her week
in the Home Office

40:50.640 --> 40:53.880
before Her Majesty is forced
to choose a new Prime Minister.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.600
You know what they say about
a week in politics.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.760
Fuck the confidence vote.
I'm going to the country anyway.

41:02.920 --> 41:06.560
If they want an election,
I'll give them one and I'll win.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.960
The small matter of the fixed term
parliaments act...

41:09.120 --> 41:11.080
Then I'll abstain from
the confidence vote.

41:11.280 --> 41:15.440
I think the Chief Whip'd have
something to say about that.
Fuck the Chief Whip.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.000
You cannot just ask people
to judge you

41:19.160 --> 41:21.920
on how you've handled the crisis.
You have to offer something new,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.680
something positive.
So you're my Chief of Staff.

41:33.080 --> 41:35.040
Make a break with the past.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.400
Announce a wealth tax.
What?!

41:38.560 --> 41:40.960
Listen - You are joking,
we're still the Conservative Party.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.760
Announce a wealth tax to fund
a solidarity scheme

41:43.920 --> 41:46.200
for victims of the storm.
People with gold taps

41:46.320 --> 41:48.320
on their yachts can afford it.

41:48.480 --> 41:51.480
Say we are going to do things
differently now.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.440
Support diversity without being
a box-ticking opportunist.

41:54.600 --> 41:58.520
Be presidential, as you have been
all through this crisis.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.560
Then you can win.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.000
You're right.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.840
We can't go back
to the way things were.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.040
NEWS REPORTER:
Francine Bridge has hinted

42:16.200 --> 42:19.800
that she might be open to a return
to parliamentary politics.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.680
FRANCINE: I remain a mainstream
social democrat whose core beliefs

42:22.840 --> 42:25.600
are fighting poverty and injustice
through progressive reform.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.520
There must surely be a party around
that represents such values

42:28.680 --> 42:30.720
in these chaotic
and dangerous times.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.040
Good morning, everyone.
ALL: Good morning.

42:35.200 --> 42:38.240
Our new Home Secretary
Parminder Haigh

42:38.400 --> 42:41.440
will be chairing the meeting.
Welcome, Parminder.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.360
Now, today will be
our last daily COBRA,

42:44.520 --> 42:48.240
and I just wanted to thank you all
for your tremendous efforts.

42:48.360 --> 42:50.920
These last weeks have been horrendous

42:51.080 --> 42:53.400
and have led to both
agonising decisions

42:53.520 --> 42:55.760
and terrible outcomes.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.960
People have died.

42:58.120 --> 43:00.800
I have been guided at all times
by what I believe

43:00.920 --> 43:03.000
to be the national interest.

43:03.120 --> 43:05.280
Now, as you are aware,

43:05.400 --> 43:07.520
there is a confidence vote this week.

43:07.640 --> 43:09.880
That vote is now irrelevant.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.600
I intend to call a general election

43:12.760 --> 43:15.880
and let the people pass judgement on
our handling of this crisis.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.040
A crisis that has cost so much

43:18.200 --> 43:20.360
and whose consequences
will be felt for years.

43:20.520 --> 43:23.800
Who do they trust to lead us
through this difficult period

43:23.920 --> 43:26.560
that lies ahead?

43:26.720 --> 43:29.800
Fraser, I understand you have
an update on the Red Zone.

43:31.320 --> 43:35.480
So, we still have some voltage
instability in the Red Zone,

43:35.640 --> 43:39.000
but the other zones are now
fully operational.

43:39.120 --> 43:41.040
