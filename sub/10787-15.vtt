WEBVTT

00:11.166 --> 00:13.375
SO WE'RE, UH, WE'RE
OK WITH EVERYTHING?

00:13.375 --> 00:15.000
TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY.

00:15.000 --> 00:15.250
AWESOME. HEH.

00:16.291 --> 00:19.500
BUT, WHAT IF WE HAD
GONE THROUGH WITH IT?

00:19.500 --> 00:20.917
WHAT--WHAT IF I HADN'T
PUT A STOP

00:20.917 --> 00:22.000
TO OUR ILL-CONCEIVED
FUMBLINGS?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.083
WHAT--WHAT IF I HAD
GOTTEN PREGNANT,

00:24.083 --> 00:26.750
WE HAD TO DROP OUT
OF SCHOOL SENIOR YEAR

00:26.750 --> 00:28.667
TO RAISE OUR
ILLEGITIMATE LOVE CHILD?

00:28.667 --> 00:30.875
WELL, UH, THEN THERE
WOULD COME A DAY

00:30.875 --> 00:32.040
WHERE WE'D HAVE TO
SIT DOWN AND EXPLAIN

00:32.040 --> 00:33.250
TO OUR SAID
LOVE CHILD

00:33.250 --> 00:35.625
THAT, UH, MOMMY AND
DADDY CAN'T HAVE SEX

00:35.625 --> 00:37.667
UNLESS DADDY'S
THINKING ABOUT
RYAN PHILLIPPE.

00:37.667 --> 00:41.250
HEY, I MEAN, DON'T
THINK I WOULDN'T BE
THINKING ABOUT HIM, TOO.

00:41.834 --> 00:45.041
JENNIFER LINDLEY.

00:45.041 --> 00:46.583
ARE THERE ANY OTHER
DELINQUENT ACTS

00:46.583 --> 00:50.708
YOU CARE TO COMMIT
BEFORE WE EMBARK
ON OUR JOURNEY HOME?

00:50.708 --> 00:52.166
NO, SIR. NO.

00:53.375 --> 00:54.875
SO, UH, WHAT'S
IT GONNA BE?

00:54.875 --> 00:56.083
MY PUNISHMENT.

00:56.083 --> 00:58.041
PUNISHMENT IS THE WRONG WORD,
MISS LINDLEY.

00:58.041 --> 01:01.959
WHAT I HAVE IN MIND FOR YOU
MAY JUST BE THE CHICKEN SOUP

01:01.959 --> 01:04.250
YOUR SOUL HAS BEEN
SO OBVIOUSLY CRYING OUT FOR.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.375
BUT, SIR, I MEAN,
THEY'RE ONLY--

01:05.375 --> 01:06.291
THEY'RE ONLY LIKE
AIRPLANE--WHAT?!

01:07.208 --> 01:09.750
KUDOS ARE IN ORDER,
MR. VALENTINE.

01:09.750 --> 01:13.375
YOUR TARDY ARRIVAL
HAS NOW PUT US
OFF SCHEDULE ENTIRELY.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.959
JUST EXACTLY WHAT
PART OF "WE LEAVE
AT 6:30 A.M. SHARP"

01:14.959 --> 01:17.166
WERE YOU NOT
LISTENING TO?

01:17.166 --> 01:19.041
THAT'S GREAT...
YEAH.

01:19.041 --> 01:21.125
BUT, UH, BEFORE
WE CONTINUE
THIS DISCUSSION,

01:21.125 --> 01:22.458
COULD WE STOP AT
A STARBUCKS PLEASE?

01:22.458 --> 01:24.125
GET ON THE BUS,
PUNK.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.250
AND WHERE ARE
JOEY POTTER
AND PACEY WITTER?

01:27.250 --> 01:28.417
PROBABLY OFF SOMEWHERE
SUCKING FACE.

01:28.417 --> 01:29.417
YEAH, TELL ME
ABOUT IT.

01:29.417 --> 01:30.208
YES, AND NOW I HAVE
TO GO LOOK FOR THEM,

01:30.208 --> 01:32.625
WHICH IS NOT
ON THE SCHEDULE.

01:36.166 --> 01:37.333
MR. KASDAN...

01:37.333 --> 01:38.417
YES?

01:40.083 --> 01:42.375
LOOKS LIKE
YOU WERE RIGHT.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.083
[GROANS]

01:47.083 --> 01:49.625
IT'S DISGUSTING,
ISN'T IT?

01:51.208 --> 01:53.500
[WHISTLES]

03:29.166 --> 03:30.792
I WAS THINKING
MORE ALONG THE LINES

03:30.792 --> 03:32.166
OF SOMETHING THAT REQUIRED
SILVERWARE, PACE.

03:32.166 --> 03:35.083
HEY, BUS TICKETS
COST MONEY, WOMAN,

03:35.083 --> 03:37.375
AND YOU HAD ME PAY
FOR THAT IMPROMPTU
PHOTO SESSION,

03:37.375 --> 03:39.417
SO HOW DOES COFFEE
AND CRACKERS SOUND?

03:40.792 --> 03:42.959
LOVELY.

03:47.125 --> 03:50.917
SO...
YOU TELL BESSIE?

03:51.500 --> 03:52.417
TELL BESSIE WHAT?

03:54.792 --> 03:57.417
DOES THE WORD "DUH"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

03:57.417 --> 03:59.792
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

03:59.792 --> 04:01.708
WHAT EXACTLY WAS I
SUPPOSED TO SAY, PACE?

04:01.708 --> 04:03.333
AND IF YOU SAY THAT
I'M A WOMAN NOW,

04:03.333 --> 04:05.041
I WILL PROJECTILE
VOMIT ON YOU.

04:05.041 --> 04:05.375
OK, FINE.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.542
WHAT ABOUT GRETCHEN?

04:09.542 --> 04:11.792
[LAUGHS] YEAH. UH,

04:11.792 --> 04:13.959
HEY, GRETCHEN, SORRY
WE MISSED THE BUS BACK.

04:13.959 --> 04:16.750
BY THE WAY, YOUR BROTHER
DEFLOWERED ME LAST NIGHT.
GOTTA GO.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.791
I MEAN, DO I REALLY
STRIKE YOU AS THE TYPE
OF PERSON

04:19.791 --> 04:21.083
WHO ENJOYS DISCUSSING
MY BOYFRIEND'S
SEXUAL PROWESS

04:21.083 --> 04:23.250
WITH HIS SIBLINGS?

04:23.250 --> 04:25.583
OK, POINT TAKEN, BUT...

04:25.583 --> 04:27.291
LET ME JUST POSE THIS
HYPOTHETICAL.

04:27.291 --> 04:28.750
LET'S SAY THAT YOU WERE
THE TYPE OF PERSON

04:28.750 --> 04:30.500
THAT ENJOYED DISCUSSING
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
SEXUAL PROWESS.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.333
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT SAY?

04:31.333 --> 04:34.291
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT THE PROWESS?

04:34.291 --> 04:36.417
YEAH.
ABOUT THE PROWESS.

04:36.417 --> 04:39.667
YOU KNOW, JUST WHEN I THINK
YOU'RE THE ANTITHESIS
OF THE TYPICAL MALE,

04:39.667 --> 04:41.166
THERE YOU ARE,
DRAGGING YOUR KNUCKLES

04:41.166 --> 04:42.417
WITH THE REST
OF THE PRIMATES.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.417
WELL, YOU SHOULD
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE

04:44.417 --> 04:45.542
A PRIMATE'S DESIRE
TO HEAR ABOUT

04:45.542 --> 04:46.667
HIS ABILITIES
IN THE SACK.

04:46.667 --> 04:47.708
POP TART?

05:00.125 --> 05:00.417
PICK ONE.

05:05.708 --> 05:07.083
PICK THE OTHER ONE.

05:11.375 --> 05:13.208
I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE MOST EQUAL
OF EXCHANGES.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.417
YOU KNOW,
VIRGINITY FOR
CHOCOLATE HEARTS,

05:14.417 --> 05:16.792
BUT I THOUGHT
I SHOULD GET YOU
SOMETHING.

05:16.792 --> 05:18.166
JUST TO COMMEMORATE
THE EVENT.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.291
WOW, IF I HAD KNOWN
THERE WERE PRIZES INVOLVED,

05:19.291 --> 05:21.333
I WOULD'VE ASKED
FOR A CAR.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.291
I MEAN, NOTHING
TOO EXPENSIVE,

05:23.291 --> 05:25.500
JUST, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
TO TOOL AROUND IN.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.291
HOW ABOUT
THE WITTER WAGONEER?

05:28.291 --> 05:30.625
THE WITTER WAGONEER?

05:30.625 --> 05:32.750
DO I LOOK LIKE SOME
TWO-BIT FLOOZY TO YOU?

05:32.750 --> 05:34.083
NO, YOU DON'T.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.500
NO?
NO. TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,

05:35.500 --> 05:37.375
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE EVER LOOKED
MORE BEAUTIFUL.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.125
YOU'RE EASY, 'CAUSE
I DIDN'T EVEN GET

05:43.125 --> 05:44.625
A CHANCE TO SHOWER
THIS MORNING.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.500
WHOA, APPARENTLY
YOU DIDN'T GET A CHANCE

05:50.500 --> 05:51.750
TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH,
EITHER.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.708
THIS FROM THE
"MORNING BREATH"
MONSTER HIMSELF.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.250
OH, MAN,
I COULD DO THIS.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.500
WHAT?

05:57.500 --> 05:59.375
THIS--
THE BACK AND FORTH,

05:59.375 --> 06:01.750
THE SWEETNESS
AND THE SARCASM.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.792
I COULD DO THIS FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

06:05.792 --> 06:07.625
WITH YOU
AS MY PARTNER
IN IRREVERENCE.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.000
WELL, HAVE YOU EVER
STOPPED TO THINK

06:12.000 --> 06:14.333
THAT MAYBE YOU'RE JUST
THE FIRST OF MANY, PACE?

06:14.333 --> 06:16.417
OH.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.875
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I GUESS I JUST HAVE
TO BE SATISFIED

06:18.875 --> 06:20.625
WITH BEING
THE NEIL ARMSTRONG
OF THE BUNCH.

06:36.250 --> 06:40.250
SO, TYPICALLY WHEN COUPLES
ENGAGE IN THE SORT
OF ACTIVITY

06:40.250 --> 06:41.708
THAT WE ENGAGED IN
LAST NIGHT,

06:41.708 --> 06:43.708
THERE IS SOME SORT OF
MORNING-AFTER DISCUSSION.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.959
ABOUT WHAT?

06:45.959 --> 06:49.166
WELL, IT'S A BIT LIKE
A POST-GAME WRAP-UP.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.375
I SEE.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.500
YOU WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU WERE ANY GOOD.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.500
WELL, I'D REALLY RATHER KNOW
IF IT WAS GOOD FOR YOU.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.625
OF COURSE.

06:59.625 --> 07:03.000
YOU BEING PACEY WITTER,
FRIEND TO WOMEN AND ALL.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.542
PRECISELY.

07:07.708 --> 07:09.542
IT WAS VERY NICE.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.125
NICE?

07:15.125 --> 07:16.875
YES.

07:18.625 --> 07:19.667
[CLEARS THROAT]

07:19.667 --> 07:20.750
JUST "NICE," HUH?

07:22.667 --> 07:23.875
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH "NICE?"

07:23.875 --> 07:25.834
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH "NICE."

07:25.834 --> 07:28.083
I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH "GREAT," EITHER.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.083
HELL, THERE'S NOTHING
PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE

07:30.083 --> 07:32.041
WITH "MIND-BLOWING"
OR "TRANSCENDENT."

07:32.041 --> 07:34.583
SORRY, PACE, I LEFT
MY THESAURUS AT HOME.

07:34.583 --> 07:37.333
I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS
GOING TO GET YELLED AT
FOR MY VOCABULARY.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.625
I'M NOT TOO WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR VOCABULARY.

07:41.959 --> 07:45.291
YOU KNOW, MAYBE "NICE"
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME,
PACEY.

07:45.291 --> 07:46.583
MAYBE "NICE"
IS ALL A GIRL CAN MANAGE

07:46.583 --> 07:48.291
THE MORNING AFTER
HER FIRST TIME,

07:48.291 --> 07:49.542
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,

07:49.542 --> 07:51.000
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'VE
EVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.250
SO I CAN'T REALLY SIT
HERE AND HONESTLY SAY

07:53.250 --> 07:55.000
THAT SOMETHING
IS "GREAT"

07:55.000 --> 07:55.959
OR "MIND-BLOWING"
OR "TRANSCENDENT"

07:55.959 --> 07:57.708
IF I HAVE NOTHING
TO COMPARE IT TO.

07:57.708 --> 07:58.917
BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN...

07:58.917 --> 08:00.834
BENCHMARKS
IN THE SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:04.792 --> 08:07.000
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
THAT HAPPEN OR DON'T HAPPEN

08:07.000 --> 08:08.166
OVER THE COURSE
OF THE EVENING THAT--

08:08.166 --> 08:09.000
ARE YOU ASKING ME
IF I--

08:09.000 --> 08:10.959
YES!

08:11.834 --> 08:13.959
CAN WE PLEASE
NOT TALK ABOUT THAT?

08:13.959 --> 08:15.041
WHY?

08:15.041 --> 08:17.291
BECAUSE
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.417
OK, IT MIGHT NOT BE
IMPORTANT TO YOU,

08:19.417 --> 08:21.166
BUT IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.542
THIS ISN'T ALL
ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.166
YOU THINK YOU'RE
FEELING INSECURE?!

08:24.166 --> 08:26.375
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME
THIS MORNING?

08:29.083 --> 08:29.750
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.792
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

08:31.792 --> 08:35.457
WELL, MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO ENLIGHTEN ME, THEN.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.417
DID YOU EVER
STOP AND THINK

08:41.417 --> 08:43.500
THAT MAYBE
I MIGHT BE WONDERING
HOW I  MEASURE UP?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.500
HOW I FIT
INTO THE PICTURE

08:45.500 --> 08:48.333
THAT INCLUDES
NOT ONLY ONE

08:48.333 --> 08:49.834
BUT 2 PRIOR SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS,

08:49.834 --> 08:52.291
BOTH OF WHICH MEANT
A GREAT DEAL TO YOU?

08:52.291 --> 08:55.458
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
GIRLS THOUGHT LIKE THAT.

08:55.458 --> 08:58.583
DOES THE WORD "DUH"
MEAN ANYTHING?

08:58.583 --> 09:02.166
JO, YOU WERE GREAT.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.208
GREAT?

09:03.208 --> 09:04.917
YES, GREAT.

09:04.917 --> 09:07.333
WHICH IS A HELL OF A LOT
BETTER THAN "NICE,"
LET ME TELL YOU.

09:07.333 --> 09:08.333
AND COMPLETELY
BESIDE THE POINT.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.000
JO, YOU WERE GREAT.
YOU WERE FANTASTIC.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.750
YOU WERE EVERY
GLOWING ADJECTIVE
UNDER THE SUN.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.375
I WANT TO RUN OUT
AND TELL THE ENTIRE WORLD
WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT

09:14.375 --> 09:16.000
AND WHO I DID IT WITH.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.041
YOU'RE NOT REALLY PLANNING
ON DOING THAT, ARE YOU?

09:19.041 --> 09:19.959
WELL, NO, BUT--

09:19.959 --> 09:22.000
GOOD.

09:24.291 --> 09:25.291
WHY IS THAT GOOD?

09:25.291 --> 09:28.375
BECAUSE IT'S PRIVATE,

09:28.375 --> 09:29.583
AND I REALLY WANT
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.875
I REALLY DON'T WANT
THE WHOLE WORLD

09:30.875 --> 09:31.542
TO KNOW ABOUT
OUR SEX LIFE.

09:31.542 --> 09:35.792
MMM. I THINK I GET IT.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.583
BY "THE WHOLE WORLD,"
WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN
IS DAWSON.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.083
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE
ABOUT THAT?

09:40.083 --> 09:42.375
WHY CAN'T IT JUST BE THE
FACT THAT I DON'T
WANT TO HURT HIM

09:42.375 --> 09:43.708
ANY MORE THAN
I ALREADY HAVE?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.000
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT HIM, EITHER.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.250
OK? I DON'T.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.500
BUT I DO WANT TO BE ABLE
TO HAVE SEX WITH MY GIRLFRIEND,

09:48.500 --> 09:50.583
WHOM I ADORE, WITHOUT
HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT

09:50.583 --> 09:52.708
THE SOAP OPERATIC REPERCUSSIONS
OF HIM FINDING OUT.

09:52.708 --> 09:55.625
LET ME ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION, JO.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.291
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM?

09:57.291 --> 09:58.417
YOU KNOW, IF HE WERE HERE
RIGHT NOW AND HE ASKED YOU,

09:58.417 --> 10:00.542
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL HIM?

10:02.583 --> 10:04.708
WELL, I WOULD HAVE TO
TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.458
AND YOU'D DO THAT?

10:10.250 --> 10:12.250
YES. ABSOLUTELY.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.959
WANNA KNOW SOMETHING FUNNY?

10:23.959 --> 10:26.667
YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED ME.

10:28.583 --> 10:29.542
WHAT?

10:29.542 --> 10:33.125
YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED ME
ALL MORNING.

10:33.125 --> 10:35.583
AND HERE I WAS THINKING
THAT SEX BROUGHT PEOPLE
CLOSER TOGETHER.

11:24.792 --> 11:28.708
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY
IT WAS SO NICE, PACEY?

11:33.291 --> 11:37.291
YOU PROBABLY DON'T
EVEN REMEMBER, BUT...

11:37.291 --> 11:39.500
THERE WAS THIS THING.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.041
THERE YOU WERE,
ABOVE ME,

11:42.041 --> 11:49.917
AND YOU--YOU
BRUSHED MY HAIR
OVER MY FOREHEAD...

11:52.208 --> 11:53.875
AND IT FELT REALLY NICE.

11:53.875 --> 11:57.834
MADE ME FEEL SAFE.

11:57.834 --> 12:02.375
LIKE NO MATTER WHAT,
YOU WERE GONNA BE THERE

12:02.375 --> 12:04.583
AND YOU WERE GONNA
PROTECT ME.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.542
YEARS FROM NOW,
WHEN I LOOK BACK,

12:07.542 --> 12:12.625
I'M REALLY NOT GONNA
REMEMBER THE CLUMSY
POSITIONING

12:12.625 --> 12:15.708
OR THE MORNING-AFTER
AWKWARDNESS

12:15.708 --> 12:18.458
OR WHETHER OR NOT
THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF

12:18.458 --> 12:21.208
MET THE TEXTBOOK
DEFINITION OF GREAT SEX.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.542
I'M GONNA REMEMBER
HOW SWEET YOU WERE.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.583
HOW YOU TOOK ME
TO THIS BRAND NEW PLACE.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.208
PACE, I'M GLAD
I HAD SEX.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.667
AND I'M REALLY GLAD THAT
I HAD SEX WITH YOU.

12:48.375 --> 12:53.500
BUT NOW, I REALLY JUST
KINDA WANNA GO HOME.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.375
SO WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.875
IT'S GONNA GET BETTER.
I PROMISE.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.125
SO, WHAT DOES
GRAMS WANT, ANYWAY?

13:59.125 --> 14:01.417
I DON'T KNOW. SHE TOLD
ME TO MEET HER HERE

14:01.417 --> 14:04.708
AFTER THE FUNERAL.
SHE SAID SHE'D BE
IN THE GARAGE.

14:14.041 --> 14:18.500
HEH. PROP FROM ONE
OF ARTHUR'S PICTURES.

14:18.500 --> 14:23.542
MAYBE I COULD USE THIS
TO KEEP MY GRANDDAUGHTER
IN LINE.

14:25.792 --> 14:28.083
Dawson: I HAD NO IDEA
HE KEPT ALL THIS STUFF.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.750
Grams: OH, HE
COLLECTED ALL THIS
OVER THE YEARS.

14:30.750 --> 14:34.333
SOUGHT IT OUT,
PIECE BY PIECE.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.625
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER
WHAT HE MIGHT
HAVE SAID,

14:36.625 --> 14:38.208
ARTHUR WAS
FIERCELY PROUD

14:38.208 --> 14:40.750
OF WHAT HE
ACCOMPLISHED
IN HIS CAREER.

14:47.125 --> 14:50.166
IT WAS A LOVELY
SERVICE, WASN'T IT?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.834
YEAH, QUITE A TURN-OUT, TOO.

14:55.834 --> 14:59.208
IT WAS A LOVELY SERVICE,
MRS. RYAN.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.291
Gretchen:
HOW CAN WE HELP?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.667
ARTHUR MENTIONED HE
DIDN'T WANT THIS STUFF

15:05.667 --> 15:07.041
JUST COLLECTING DUST.

15:07.041 --> 15:11.083
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT
DONATE IT SOMEWHERE.

15:11.083 --> 15:13.125
IF YOU HAVE ANY
SUGGESTIONS, DAWSON...

15:14.208 --> 15:16.208
WHAT'S THE POINT?
NOBODY KNOWS HE EXISTED.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.875
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING HERE
YOU WOULD LIKE,

15:17.875 --> 15:20.208
SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER HIM BY.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.834
NO, L-LET ME.

15:48.041 --> 15:51.708
I'M SORRY, DAWSON.

15:51.708 --> 15:54.250
I KNOW THIS CAN'T
BE EASY FOR YOU.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.750
OH, IT'S NOT, BUT THAT
DOESN'T GIVE ME

15:55.750 --> 15:57.750
ANY RIGHT TO BE RUDE.
I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.166
OH, THERE'S NO NEED.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.792
EVERYONE DEALS WITH DEATH
IN HIS OWN WAY.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.333
SOME CRY, SOME PRAY,

16:03.333 --> 16:04.875
SOME GET ANGRY
AT THE WORLD.

16:04.875 --> 16:07.375
THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.667
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO BE HERE TODAY?

16:10.667 --> 16:13.792
IT'S COMPLETELY MORBID.

16:13.792 --> 16:16.458
WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT
TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES
TO THIS?

16:16.458 --> 16:20.834
DAWSON, YOU AND I HAVE
LOST A VERY DEAR FRIEND,

16:20.834 --> 16:22.917
AND THE PAIN OF THAT LOSS

16:22.917 --> 16:25.875
ISN'T GOING TO JUST
DISAPPEAR ANY TIME SOON.

16:25.875 --> 16:29.458
IT WILL PASS, SLOWLY,
AT ITS OWN PACE,

16:29.458 --> 16:32.250
AND THERE'S PRECIOUS LITTLE
YOU OR I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.458
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I'VE LEARNED

16:39.458 --> 16:41.458
AT MY SOMEWHAT ADVANCED AGE,

16:41.458 --> 16:45.792
IT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF CLOSURE
IN THE GRIEVING PROCESS.

16:47.917 --> 16:51.417
I DON'T THINK IT'S
THE LACK OF CLOSURE
THAT'S BOTHERING ME.

16:51.417 --> 16:53.458
HMM...WHAT IS IT, THEN?

16:56.917 --> 16:58.250
I DON'T KNOW.

17:00.917 --> 17:02.125
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SPEND SOME TIME WITH HIM,

17:02.125 --> 17:07.040
WITH HIS SPACE,
WITH HIS THINGS...

17:07.040 --> 17:09.583
FIND A WAY
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

17:09.583 --> 17:12.290
MAYBE THAT WILL HELP YOU
FIGURE THINGS OUT.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.959
Gretchen:
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.125
DELIA AND GEORGE
BY ARTHUR BROOKS?

17:54.125 --> 17:56.708
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A SCREENPLAY.

17:56.708 --> 17:57.708
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S A PLAY, ACTUALLY.

17:57.708 --> 18:00.125
IT SAYS 1949.

18:00.125 --> 18:02.333
HE WAS MY AGE
WHEN HE WROTE THIS.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.917
"I'M HOPPING MAD
AT YOU, GEORGE."

18:08.917 --> 18:12.667
COME ON.
IT'LL BE FUN.

18:15.291 --> 18:16.583
"WHATEVER FOR, DEAR?"

18:16.583 --> 18:19.333
"BECAUSE I FIND YOU
TO BE A RATHER
IRRITATING FELLOW."

18:19.333 --> 18:23.083
"WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER?"

18:23.083 --> 18:25.917
"YOU MIGHT GO
JUMP IN THAT LAKE
OVER THERE."

18:25.917 --> 18:26.917
"BUT THAT WOULD
RUIN MY SUIT."

18:26.917 --> 18:28.917
"WHICH WOULD BE
A FITTING PUNISHMENT."

18:28.917 --> 18:30.166
"FOR LOVING A SKIRT
LIKE YOU?"

18:30.166 --> 18:34.083
"FUNNY, I THOUGHT
I WAS A DAME."

18:35.875 --> 18:37.500
"NO, MY DEAR,
YOU'RE A SKIRT.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.000
MOST DEFINITELY
A SKIRT."

18:46.875 --> 18:49.542
SORRY. IT WAS
IN THE SCRIPT.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.250
DAMN. I THOUGHT YOU
WERE IMPROVISING.

18:53.625 --> 18:54.208
THAT WAS SWEET.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.750
BROOKS WAS SWEET.

18:58.458 --> 19:02.792
YEAH. YEAH, HE WAS.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.708
ONCE UPON A TIME,
BEFORE HE GAVE UP.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.083
5 PEOPLE SHOWED UP
AT HIS FUNERAL.

19:16.083 --> 19:20.291
5--YOU, ME,
MY PARENTS, AND GRAMS,

19:20.291 --> 19:21.542
WHICH MEANS THAT
3 OF THE PEOPLE
BARELY KNEW HIM.

19:21.542 --> 19:24.250
I MEAN, JUST THINK,
IF I HADN'T CRASHED HIS BOAT,

19:24.250 --> 19:25.291
NOBODY WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP.

19:25.291 --> 19:28.959
I'M SORRY, I FIND
THAT...PATHETIC.

19:28.959 --> 19:32.542
I DON'T THINK MR. BROOKS
NEEDS YOUR PITY, DAWSON.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.250
I MEAN, THIS IS A GUY
WHO SAW HIS WILDEST
DREAMS COME TRUE.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.500
THAT'S A HELL
OF A LOT MORE
THAN MOST OF US GET.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.125
YEAH, AND THIS WHAT
HE HAS TO SHOW FOR IT?

19:40.125 --> 19:41.083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:41.083 --> 19:42.333
LOOK AROUND YOU.
THIS IS IT.

19:44.375 --> 19:47.834
THIS--THIS--I MEAN,
THIS IS AN ENTIRE LIFE.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.667
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS. STUFF.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.041
STUFF! A GARAGE
FULL OF STUFF.

19:52.041 --> 19:53.667
NOW YOU'RE STARTING
TO SOUND LIKE HIM.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.458
YEAH, WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT SCARES ME,

19:55.458 --> 19:57.291
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT
HE JUST DECIDED

19:57.291 --> 19:59.291
IT WAS EASIER
TO STOP CARING.

19:59.291 --> 20:02.000
AND HE DID, AND BY THE TIME
HE WOKE UP, IT WAS TOO LATE.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.166
WHAT'S TO PREVENT ANY OF US
FROM ENDING UP LIKE THAT?

20:04.166 --> 20:06.375
THAT'S NOT YOU, DAWSON.
THAT WOULD NEVER BE YOU.

20:06.375 --> 20:09.000
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.291
I MEAN, H-HOW CAN
YOU BE SURE?

20:10.291 --> 20:12.542
I MEAN, I LOST THE GIRL
JUST LIKE HE DID.

20:12.542 --> 20:13.834
YEAH, AND YOU PICKED
YOURSELF UP,

20:13.834 --> 20:17.959
YOU DUSTED YOURSELF OFF,
AND YOU TOOK A CHANCE.

20:17.959 --> 20:19.208
LOOK, SO WHAT IF HE
SCREWED UP, YOU KNOW?

20:19.208 --> 20:21.875
SO WHAT IF HE WAS
A COWARD

20:21.875 --> 20:24.375
FOR MORE YEARS
THAN HE WAS A HERO?

20:24.375 --> 20:25.417
IN THE END,
HE GOT IT RIGHT.

20:27.834 --> 20:28.959
DO YOU KNOW
WHEN I REALIZED

20:28.959 --> 20:31.041
THAT MY FEELINGS FOR YOU
WERE MORE THAN PLATONIC?

20:31.041 --> 20:33.625
IT WAS THAT
STUPID MOVIE.
WHAT MOVIE?

20:33.625 --> 20:35.041
THE ONE WE WATCHED
IN YOUR ROOM THAT NIGHT.

20:35.041 --> 20:36.792
TURN AWAY, MY SWEET.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.750
WATCHING YOU
WATCH THAT MOVIE,

20:39.750 --> 20:42.375
SEEING YOU COME ALIVE IN A WAY
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.417
I MEAN, IN THAT MOMENT
I JUST KNEW I WANTED TO BE

20:44.417 --> 20:48.083
A PART OF YOUR LIFE IN THIS
BIGGER AND BETTER WAY.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.792
AND IN SOME
WEIRD WAY, DAWSON,

20:51.792 --> 20:54.500
MR. BROOKS
BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

21:06.792 --> 21:08.417
I LIKE YOU.

21:08.417 --> 21:12.083
OH, GOD. WHY?

21:12.083 --> 21:13.583
BECAUSE YOU'RE SMART
AND YOU'RE FUNNY

21:13.583 --> 21:14.250
AND YOU ALWAYS
KNOW WHAT TO SAY

21:14.250 --> 21:16.333
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.834
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.750
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL IN A WAY
THAT MAKES ME REMEMBER

21:22.750 --> 21:23.834
THOSE OLD-TIME MOVIE STARS.

21:23.834 --> 21:24.667
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE ONES
IN BROOKS' MOVIES?

21:24.667 --> 21:27.625
YOU KNOW, ALL STYLE
AND GRACE.

21:27.625 --> 21:28.708
PLUS, YOU SMELL GOOD.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.583
I DO?

21:30.583 --> 21:31.750
YEAH, NOT LIKE
IN A PERFUMEY WAY,

21:31.750 --> 21:35.375
BUT IN A REALLY
"PRETTY GIRL"
KIND OF WAY.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.166
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, DO YOU?

21:38.166 --> 21:41.625
NO...

21:41.625 --> 21:42.792
GOOD. KEEP IT THAT WAY.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.125
'CAUSE THE SECOND
YOU BECOME AWARE

21:44.125 --> 21:45.166
OF JUST HOW
CHARMING YOU ARE,

21:45.166 --> 21:46.500
YOU'RE GONNA USE
YOUR POWERS FOR EVIL.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.959
GRETCHEN, WOULD YOU--
WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY--

21:55.959 --> 21:57.125
YOU WANNA BE ALONE.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.166
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

21:58.166 --> 21:59.166
'CAUSE I'M AN
AWESOME GIRLFRIEND.

21:59.166 --> 22:00.959
MAKE THAT AN AWESOME SKIRT.

22:00.959 --> 22:02.625
I LIKE THAT.

22:08.458 --> 22:09.708
I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

22:09.708 --> 22:10.458
OK.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.834
JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

22:17.834 --> 22:18.542
WHAT?

22:18.542 --> 22:20.792
WHEN YOU REMEMBER BROOKS,

22:20.792 --> 22:23.917
REMEMBER THAT GREAT BIG
THUMPING HEART OF HIS.

22:23.917 --> 22:25.708
REMEMBER HOW SWEET
HE WAS TO GRAMS.

22:25.708 --> 22:27.667
REMEMBER HOW, WHEN HE
SAW US UNDER THE MISTLETOE,

22:27.667 --> 22:31.959
HE TOLD YOU TO "QUIT FLIRTING
AND KISS HER ALREADY."

22:31.959 --> 22:33.542
REMEMBER THAT GUY, DAWSON.

23:21.625 --> 23:23.667
Man: DAWSON? DAWSON LEERY?

23:24.250 --> 23:26.500
UH, CAN I HELP YOU?

23:26.500 --> 23:27.542
OH, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,

23:27.542 --> 23:28.875
BUT THE YOUNG LADY OUTSIDE

23:28.875 --> 23:29.542
TOLD ME I COULD
FIND YOU IN HERE.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.625
I'M PATRICK FELKER.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.041
I'M HANDLING

23:32.041 --> 23:34.917
OH. UH...

23:41.041 --> 23:42.250
NICE TO MEET YOU.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.125
MY PLEASURE. UM,
I WAS HOPING

23:44.125 --> 23:45.667
THAT YOU'D COME BY MY OFFICE
THIS AFTERNOON.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.959
WHAT FOR?

23:47.959 --> 23:50.250
IT'S REGARDING
MR. BROOKS' WILL.

23:50.250 --> 23:51.750
HIS WILL? WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

23:51.750 --> 23:52.834
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

23:52.834 --> 23:55.959
WHY DON'T YOU DROP BY
AND WE'LL TALK.

23:55.959 --> 23:56.667
OK.

23:59.083 --> 24:01.875
SO, WHO WAS
THIS GUY, ANYWAY?

24:01.875 --> 24:02.875
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:02.875 --> 24:05.375
I DON'T KNOW, UM...

24:05.375 --> 24:06.625
WAS HE SOME KIND
OF MOVIE STAR OR SOMETHING?

24:06.625 --> 24:13.083
NO, HE WAS A, UH...HE
WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS.

24:13.083 --> 24:18.250
HE WAS A GRUMPY,
MISANTHROPIC,

24:18.250 --> 24:20.500
SMARTER-THAN-THOU
PAIN IN THE ASS.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.583
BARELY A KIND WORD
FOR ANYBODY WHO EVER
CROSSED HIS PATH.

24:22.583 --> 24:27.375
BUT, UH, HE WAS A...
HE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE,

24:27.375 --> 24:30.625
AND I'M GONNA MISS HIM.

24:32.291 --> 24:35.458
YEAH, WELL...
THIS AFTERNOON, THEN.

24:35.458 --> 24:36.667

OH. YEAH.

FOR THE MESS.

TO WORK ON IT.

BEEN IN THERAPY.

YOU TAKE IT RIGHT.

26:09.625 --> 26:10.500

QUITE SURPRISING,

26:10.500 --> 26:13.208
GIVEN MY SORDID
HISTORY AND ALL,

26:13.208 --> 26:14.834
BUT LET'S NOT GET
AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

ABOUT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

26:30.750 --> 26:32.417
HA! DO WE HAVE TO?

26:32.417 --> 26:33.917

YOU NEED TO BE HERE?

26:33.917 --> 26:36.291
ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK
I NEED TO BE HERE.

26:36.291 --> 26:38.291
THEN WHY ARE YOU?

26:38.291 --> 26:39.083
COME ON. I'M SURE
THAT THEY TOLD YOU.

26:39.083 --> 26:40.834
WELL, FROM
WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

26:40.834 --> 26:42.291
THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME DISCIPLINARY
ISSUES.

26:42.291 --> 26:43.291
MMM.

26:43.291 --> 26:48.208
ALL RIGHT. SEE,
I WAS ON THIS SKI TRIP,

26:48.208 --> 26:50.333
AND A TEACHER CAUGHT ME
THROWING AWAY EMPTY
LIQUOR BOTTLES.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.166
SO YOU WERE DRINKING?

26:52.166 --> 26:53.208
YEAH.

26:53.208 --> 26:54.583
IS THAT BAD?

26:54.583 --> 26:57.792

DOING IT.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.417
SEE, HERE'S THE THING.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.458
I HAD JUST BEEN THROUGH
THIS REALLY BIG ORDEAL
WITH MY BEST FRIEND JACK.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.750
WE'D ALMOST SLEPT TOGETHER,

27:03.750 --> 27:07.166
BUT I HAD THE PRESENCE
OF MIND TO PUT THE CABOSH
ON IT, WHICH IS GOOD,

27:07.166 --> 27:09.792
'CAUSE HE'S A HOMO--
HE'S A HOMOSEXUAL,
WHICH IS...

27:09.792 --> 27:11.041
HA HA HA.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.125
THAT'S NOT HEALTHY--

27:12.125 --> 27:14.708
NOT THE HOMSEX--
NOT HIM BEING A HOMOSEXUAL,

27:14.708 --> 27:15.583
BUT SLEEPING
WITH A HOMOSEXUAL--

27:15.583 --> 27:17.750
I KEEP SAYING HOMOSEXUAL.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.417
I SOUND LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER.

27:19.417 --> 27:21.500
GAY. GAY. GAY.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.625
YOU COULD BE GAY.
ARE YOU GAY?

27:23.625 --> 27:25.291
IS THAT
IMPORTANT TO YOU?

27:25.291 --> 27:25.959
HA.

27:25.959 --> 27:27.417
JUST MAKING CONVERSATION.

27:27.417 --> 27:29.542
BACK TO THE DRINKING.

27:29.542 --> 27:30.500
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU DRINK?

27:30.500 --> 27:32.959
WELL, I DON'T USUALLY.

27:32.959 --> 27:34.625
BUT YOU DO SOMETIMES?

27:34.625 --> 27:35.959
YEAH, SURE, SOMETIMES.

27:35.959 --> 27:37.458
NOT LIKE I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

27:37.458 --> 27:38.625
BUT YOU LIKE TO DRINK?

27:38.625 --> 27:40.625
YEAH, WHO DOESN'T?

27:40.625 --> 27:43.000
OK, WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

27:43.000 --> 27:43.333
I'M TAKING NOTES.

27:43.333 --> 27:44.375
OH.

27:44.375 --> 27:47.125
DO I GET A COPY?

27:47.125 --> 27:49.000
NO.

27:57.333 --> 28:00.417
SO HOW LONG DO
THESE THINGS GO FOR?

28:00.417 --> 28:02.125
50 MINUTES.
50 MINUTES,
GIVE OR TAKE?

28:02.125 --> 28:03.625
NO, 50 MINUTES
PRECISELY.

28:03.625 --> 28:05.542
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DIG UP
SOME REAL JUICY STUFF?

28:05.542 --> 28:07.208
THAT'S WHAT NEXT WEEK
IS FOR.

28:07.208 --> 28:09.583
EXCUSE ME, BUT THAT
SEEMS KIND OF COLD.

28:09.583 --> 28:11.417
I WONDER WHAT IT IS
YOU DO WITH THOSE
EXTRA 10 MINUTES.

28:11.417 --> 28:12.583
I TAKE A BREAK,

28:12.583 --> 28:13.834
REST UP
FOR THE NEXT PATIENT.

28:13.834 --> 28:14.458
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU REST?

28:14.458 --> 28:16.917
WELL, EXCUSE ME,

28:16.917 --> 28:18.834
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE
EXERTING YOURSELF THAT MUCH.

28:20.625 --> 28:22.834
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

28:22.834 --> 28:24.750
WHY IS THAT
IMPORTANT TO YOU?

28:24.750 --> 28:26.166
WELL, IT'S NOT.

28:26.166 --> 28:29.500
REALLY, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AT ALL.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.875
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.375
HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR.
COLLEGE ON THE BRAIN.

28:33.375 --> 28:36.208
YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER...

28:36.208 --> 28:36.959
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

28:40.208 --> 28:42.708
OOH, BOSTON!

28:42.708 --> 28:44.750
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT'S KIND OF CROOKED.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.500
WHY DON'T I FIX IT FOR YOU?

28:46.500 --> 28:48.667
I DON'T WANT YOU
BREAKIN' OUT IN NO RASH.

28:48.667 --> 28:50.708
OH, MY GOD!
OH, SHOOT!
[CRASH]

28:50.708 --> 28:51.708
OH, MY GOD,
I'M SO SORRY.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.750
IT'S OK.
IT'S OK, JENNIFER.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.792
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT LATER.
PLEASE, LEAVE IT.

28:56.792 --> 28:58.166
REALLY, I REALLY APOLOGIZE.

28:58.166 --> 28:59.166
LEAVE IT.

28:59.166 --> 29:00.625
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE--

29:00.625 --> 29:03.875
YOU'RE A LOT YOUNGER
THAN I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD BE.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.917
HOW--HOW OLD ARE YOU?

29:06.917 --> 29:08.375
UGH! I KNOW.

29:08.375 --> 29:11.250
WHY IS IT
IMPORTANT TO ME?
FORGET I ASKED.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.750
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT
YOUR PARENTS?

29:12.750 --> 29:14.291
OH, YEAH, UM...

29:14.291 --> 29:16.166
WELL, I WAS A BIT
OF A WILD CHILD,

29:16.166 --> 29:19.458
SO MY PARENTS, THEY
SHIPPED ME OFF TO LIVE
WITH MY GRANDMOTHER.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.917
HOW'S THAT BEEN FOR YOU?

29:20.917 --> 29:22.917
FINE. FINE, BUT CRAPPY.

29:22.917 --> 29:24.208
HA HA HA.

29:24.208 --> 29:25.750
BUT I'M OVER IT, HONESTLY.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.208
I'VE DEALT WITH THIS STUFF,

29:28.208 --> 29:31.291
AND SO MY PARENTS
ARE LESS THAN PERFECT.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

29:31.291 --> 29:33.750
I'VE GOT MY GRANDMOTHER
AND MY FRIENDS.

29:33.750 --> 29:34.417
THEY HELP ME THROUGH
ALL THE ROUGH SPOTS.

29:34.417 --> 29:36.000
HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.458
I'M GOING TO BE
PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU.

29:39.458 --> 29:41.291
I DON'T THINK THAT I'M
THE KIND OF PERSON THAT
BENEFITS FROM THERAPY.

29:41.291 --> 29:44.250
I FEEL AS THOUGH I'M
RELATIVELY SELF-AWARE.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.583
YES, WELL, TEENAGERS
OFTEN CONFUSE KNOWLEDGE
WITH WISDOM.

29:47.583 --> 29:50.458
HA. WELL, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:50.458 --> 29:51.583
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT MEANS?

29:51.583 --> 29:52.834
I THINK IT MEANS
THAT YOU THINK I'M STUPID.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.041
IS THAT WHAT
YOU HEARD ME SAY?

29:54.041 --> 29:55.375
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

29:55.375 --> 29:57.959
WELL, I'M SORRY IF YOU FEEL
LIKE I'VE OFFENDED YOU.

29:57.959 --> 29:59.875
WHATEVER.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.458
BUSTED.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.708
EXCUSE ME?

30:04.708 --> 30:07.041
I JUST SAW YOU
LOOK AT THE CLOCK.

30:07.041 --> 30:08.208
AM I BORING YOU?

30:08.208 --> 30:09.542
OF COURSE NOT.

30:09.542 --> 30:10.625
OH, 'CAUSE IF I'M BORING YOU,

30:10.625 --> 30:11.542
YOU SHOULD REALLY
LET ME KNOW.

30:11.542 --> 30:12.959
[SIGHS]

30:12.959 --> 30:14.542
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:14.542 --> 30:16.792
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

30:16.792 --> 30:18.000
THIS IS NOT GOING
TO WORK OUT.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.417
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:19.417 --> 30:23.250
I MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT
A VERY GOOD MATCH
FOR EACH OTHER.

30:23.250 --> 30:24.959
YOU'RE NOT
A VERY WARM PERSON.

30:24.959 --> 30:27.166
IS THAT THE KIND OF
RELATIONSHIP YOU EXPECT
FROM YOUR THERAPIST?

30:27.166 --> 30:29.375
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE NOTICED OR NOT,

30:29.375 --> 30:32.125
BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO DO HERE IS BASED
AROUND TALKING,

30:32.125 --> 30:34.625
AND--AND YOU'RE NOT
VERY EASY TO TALK TO.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.583
WELL, PERHAPS THAT'S
SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON.

30:36.583 --> 30:38.875
NO, PERHAPS THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT YOU
SHOULD WORK ON.

30:38.875 --> 30:40.583
PERHAPS.

30:40.583 --> 30:43.500
UH--WELL--WOW!
A VICTORY!

30:43.500 --> 30:44.750
IS THAT IMPORTANT
TO YOU?

30:44.750 --> 30:45.750
TO WIN?

30:45.750 --> 30:46.667
I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.250
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION.

30:48.250 --> 30:50.375
WELL, BECAUSE THERE'S
JUST ANOTHER, MORE
IRRITATING ONE

30:50.375 --> 30:52.417
LOOMING ON THE HORIZON.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.208
YOU SHOULD GO.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.834
AND I'D LIKE TO,
BUT I CAN'T.

31:03.834 --> 31:05.208
OF COURSE, YOU CAN.

31:05.208 --> 31:07.125
I'LL TELL YOUR SCHOOL
THAT YOU FULFILLED
THE REQUIREMENT.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.834
REALLY? YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT?

31:11.834 --> 31:13.375
ABSOLUTELY.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.041
ALL RIGHT THEN.

31:18.959 --> 31:21.750
IT WAS GOOD
TO MEET YOU, JENNIFER.

31:22.375 --> 31:24.792
NICE MEETING YOU, TOO.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.417
OK, I'M JUST
GOING TO ASK.

31:29.417 --> 31:31.708
HA.

31:31.708 --> 31:35.375
AM I TOTALLY
SCREWED UP?

31:35.375 --> 31:37.875
IT'S PROBABLY TOO EARLY
FOR ME TO GUESS.

31:38.542 --> 31:39.792
TAKE CARE.

31:39.792 --> 31:42.875
BUT WERE I TO HAZARD ONE,

31:42.875 --> 31:45.041
I'D SAY THAT THE SMART,
SARCASTIC EXTERIOR

31:45.041 --> 31:47.000
MASKS A SCARED,
LONELY YOUNG WOMAN

31:47.000 --> 31:48.333
WHO'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER PARENTS
HAS SCARRED HER

31:48.333 --> 31:50.542
IN WAYS SHE HASN'T EVEN
BEGUN TO PROCESS.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.208
SHE HAS A HARD TIME
TRUSTING PEOPLE--

31:52.208 --> 31:54.542
MEN, ESPECIALLY,
AND WHO CAN BLAME HER?

31:54.542 --> 31:56.291
WHEN PARENTAL TIES ARE
SEVERED EARLY ON LIKE THAT,

31:56.291 --> 31:58.000
IT CAN SEND A YOUNG PERSON
SEARCHING FOR LOVE
AND ACCEPTANCE

31:58.000 --> 32:00.542
IN A VARIETY
OF DESTRUCTIVE WAYS,

32:00.542 --> 32:02.792
WHICH MAY EXPLAIN
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH DRUGS, ALCOHOL,

32:02.792 --> 32:05.750
AND A BEST FRIEND WHOSE
SEXUALITY PREVENTS HIM

32:05.750 --> 32:07.792
FROM EVER FULLY
RETURNING YOUR AFFECTIONS.

32:07.792 --> 32:12.417
BUT ALL THAT IS REALLY
JUST DIME STORE PSYCHOBABBLE.

32:12.417 --> 32:15.417
TRUTH IS, WE DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE YET.

32:15.417 --> 32:18.458
BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO HELP YOU FIND OUT.

32:27.667 --> 32:30.166
YOU GOT ME FOR THE HOUR.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.208
I'M NOT PROMISING
ANYTHING.

32:37.083 --> 32:39.959
AND DON'T THINK I DIDN'T
CATCH THAT WHOLE
NONE-TOO-SUBTLE

32:39.959 --> 32:43.041
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY THING
YOU JUST PULLED.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.750
WHY DON'T WE START
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

32:47.750 --> 32:51.375
OK. FRIENDS. UM...

32:51.375 --> 32:56.417
WELL, I GUESS IT
REALLY JUST STARTED
ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO.

32:56.417 --> 33:00.250
UM, IT WAS THE DAY
BEFORE MY FIRST DAY
OF MY SOPHOMORE YEAR,

33:00.250 --> 33:02.375
AND I'D JUST MOVED
FROM NEW YORK CITY
AND, UM...

33:02.375 --> 33:03.417
I DON'T KNOW,

33:03.417 --> 33:05.375
I GOT OUT OF THE CABIN
AND THERE THEY WERE.

33:05.375 --> 33:08.583
THEY WERE RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE
OF MAKING THIS MOVIE.

33:08.583 --> 33:10.291
THIS COSTUME
HAD THINGS ON IT

33:10.291 --> 33:12.834
AND DAWSON, I HAD
THE BIGGEST CRUSH
ON THE GUY, LIKE...

33:29.792 --> 33:31.000
DAWSON?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.125
JOEY.

33:32.125 --> 33:33.792
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

33:33.792 --> 33:37.750
UH, I JUST KIND OF FELT
LIKE GETTING LOST
IN A CROWD, I GUESS.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.291
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

33:39.291 --> 33:41.875
I GUESS I HAD
THE SAME IMPULSE.

33:41.875 --> 33:44.834
LOOK, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

33:44.834 --> 33:46.333
YEAH, THANKS.

33:46.333 --> 33:49.500
THESE PAST FEW DAYS
HAVE SUCKED IN WAYS

33:49.500 --> 33:51.333
I DIDN'T KNOW
WERE POSSIBLE.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.500
BUT, HEY, HOW WAS
THE SKI TRIP?

33:54.500 --> 33:57.834
OH, UH, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS FINE.

33:57.834 --> 33:59.583
DID I MISS ANYTHING
EXCITING?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.667
UH...

34:04.375 --> 34:06.542
JEN BRUISED HER FOOT.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.208
AH, WELL, AS BROOKS
WAS FOND OF SAYING,
"I'LL ALERT THE MEDIA."

34:10.708 --> 34:12.875
YOU AND PACEY HAVE FUN?

34:12.875 --> 34:15.333
YEAH. LIKE I SAID,
YOU KNOW,

34:15.333 --> 34:16.875
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.000
GOOD.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.041
MM-HMM.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.000
GOOD.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.291
UM...

34:22.625 --> 34:23.958
SHALL WE?

34:23.958 --> 34:25.250
DAWSON?

34:25.250 --> 34:26.250
YEAH?

34:26.250 --> 34:27.208
WHAT?

34:27.208 --> 34:28.250
NEVER MIND.

34:28.250 --> 34:29.208
NO.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.667
WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO SAY?

34:32.917 --> 34:37.041
WOULD YOU RATHER MAYBE
GO SOMEPLACE AND TALK?

34:37.458 --> 34:39.625
YEAH.

34:39.625 --> 34:40.917
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

34:42.041 --> 34:43.667
ME, TOO.

34:47.542 --> 34:48.583
CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING?

34:48.583 --> 34:49.750
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A SECRET,

34:49.750 --> 34:51.250
BUT I HAVEN'T
TOLD ANYBODY YET.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.166
OF COURSE.

34:52.166 --> 34:56.041
MR. BROOKS PUT ME
IN HIS WILL.

34:57.625 --> 34:58.792
REALLY?

34:58.792 --> 34:59.875
MM-HMM.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.041
DOES THAT MEAN--

35:01.041 --> 35:02.125
THAT HE LEFT ME MONEY?

35:02.125 --> 35:03.458
YEAH.

35:03.458 --> 35:05.041
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

35:05.041 --> 35:06.458
I COULD NOT BE
KIDDING YOU LESS.

35:06.458 --> 35:07.708
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH IT?

35:07.708 --> 35:10.417
APPARENTLY, I HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING GREAT WITH IT.

35:10.417 --> 35:15.000
THE PROVISO IN HIS WILL
READS, AND I QUOTE,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.417
"MR. LEERY,
THIS IS THE MONEY

35:16.417 --> 35:17.917
"WITH WHICH
ONE ACHIEVES GREATNESS,

35:17.917 --> 35:20.375
"SO DON'T GO BLOWING IT
ON WOMEN AND BOOZE.

35:20.375 --> 35:22.875
"BUT SHOULD THAT
BE YOUR CHOICE,

35:22.875 --> 35:24.458
MAKE SURE IT'S
GREAT WOMEN AND
GREAT BOOZE."

35:24.458 --> 35:25.417
WELL, NO PRESSURE THERE.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.458
I GUESS I COULD...

35:29.458 --> 35:31.458
PAY MY ENTIRE
COLLEGE TUITION.

35:31.458 --> 35:33.917
YOU COULD MAKE A MOVIE.

35:35.583 --> 35:36.834
YEAH, I COULD.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.250
WOW. IT FEELS WEIRD

35:39.250 --> 35:41.417
THINKING ABOUT HOW
I'D SPEND IT, THOUGH.

35:41.417 --> 35:42.959
IT'D BE ONE THING
IF I'D WON THE LOTTERY.

35:42.959 --> 35:44.125
THIS IS...

35:44.125 --> 35:45.500
I UNDERSTAND.

35:53.333 --> 35:54.458
WHAT?

35:54.458 --> 35:56.792
YOU SEEM DIFFERENT.

35:58.083 --> 35:59.166
I DO?

35:59.166 --> 36:00.708
YEAH.

36:00.708 --> 36:02.041
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT, TOO.

36:02.041 --> 36:04.625
IS IT YOUR HAIR
OR SOMETHING?

36:04.625 --> 36:06.875
NO. NO.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.250
IT'S NOT BAD DIFFERENT.
IT'S GOOD DIFFERENT.

36:08.250 --> 36:11.583
IT'S JUST...I DON'T KNOW.

36:11.583 --> 36:14.333
YOU WANNA
GET OUT OF HERE?

36:14.333 --> 36:16.041
SURE.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.208
THE LAST TIME
WE WERE HERE...

36:26.208 --> 36:29.166
WAS A VERY
DIFFERENT TIME.

36:29.166 --> 36:30.208
AND TO THINK

36:30.208 --> 36:32.667
WE THOUGHT THINGS
WERE COMPLICATED THEN.

36:32.667 --> 36:34.041
[LAUGHS]

36:34.041 --> 36:35.875
OH, BOY.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.917
LITTLE DID WE KNOW, HUH?

36:43.500 --> 36:44.792
DAWSON,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

36:44.792 --> 36:49.250
JO, IT'S OK.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.000
I'VE...

36:51.000 --> 36:52.542
I'VE DEALT WITH IT

36:52.542 --> 36:53.959
FROM EVERY
CONCEIVABLE ANGLE.

36:53.959 --> 36:56.083
NO. NOT ABOUT THAT.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.041
UM...

36:58.041 --> 36:59.875
I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE
FOR YOU THIS WEEKEND.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.792
IT'S OK.

37:02.792 --> 37:05.125
PLEASE, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. REALLY.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.291
DAWSON.

37:06.291 --> 37:09.375
YOU'VE BEEN IN HELL
THE LAST 3 DAYS,

37:09.375 --> 37:11.041
AND I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE

37:11.041 --> 37:13.750
GIVING YOU EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN ME.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.375
WHERE WAS I?

37:15.375 --> 37:19.708
IT'S JUST, UH...

37:19.708 --> 37:23.041
I'VE MADE SOME...
SOME BIG CHOICES

37:23.041 --> 37:24.583
AND SOME BIG DECISIONS,

37:24.583 --> 37:28.333
AND SOMETIMES I FEEL
LIKE I'M GONNA
WAKE UP ONE DAY

37:28.333 --> 37:32.625
AND REALIZE THAT ALL
THERE EVER REALLY WAS
WAS FRIENDSHIP.

37:35.208 --> 37:37.166
AND IF I WASN'T
ANY GOOD AT THAT,

37:37.166 --> 37:40.708
THEN...WHERE DOES
THAT LEAVE ME?

37:40.708 --> 37:45.917
JO, YOU'RE NOT
A BAD FRIEND.

37:45.917 --> 37:49.417
I DON'T GET TO SAY IT
MUCH ANYMORE, BUT...

37:49.417 --> 37:51.250
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

37:51.959 --> 37:55.000
YOU ALWAYS WERE.

37:58.750 --> 38:00.583
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE,

38:00.583 --> 38:02.500
NO MATTER WHERE
YOUR LIFE MAY TAKE YOU,

38:02.500 --> 38:04.208
AND NO MATTER
WHO YOU'RE WITH...

38:04.208 --> 38:08.000
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE
A PIECE OF MY HEART.

38:10.083 --> 38:12.708
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

38:14.959 --> 38:15.625
YEAH.

38:18.041 --> 38:19.708
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A HUGE PIECE.

38:19.708 --> 38:20.792
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT A HUGE PIECE.

38:20.792 --> 38:22.917
JUST ENOUGH.

38:22.917 --> 38:24.750
YOU KNOW, TINY PIECE.

38:44.792 --> 38:45.542
OH.

38:45.542 --> 38:47.208
YOU LOST ONE
OF YOUR DOGS.

38:47.208 --> 38:50.083
HOLD ON.
EXCUSE ME.

38:50.083 --> 38:50.417
EXCUSE ME. MISS.

38:52.625 --> 38:53.792
WASN'T THAT FUNNY?

38:53.792 --> 38:55.000
THAT'S IT, ACTUALLY.

38:56.166 --> 38:58.500
JOEY, THIS IS YOUR COFFEE.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.667
MORE SUGAR,

38:59.667 --> 39:00.500
WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF COFFEE MIXED IN.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.166
WELL, I, UH...

39:05.166 --> 39:07.125
I GUESS THIS
IS GOOD NIGHT.

39:08.917 --> 39:11.166
IT MAY SOUND SILLY,
BUT...

39:11.166 --> 39:13.083
THANK YOU
FOR A LOVELY NIGHT.

39:13.083 --> 39:14.667
YEAH. WE'LL HAVE
TO DO IT AGAIN
SOMETIME.

39:14.667 --> 39:15.667
YEAH.

39:15.667 --> 39:16.208
GOOD NIGHT.

39:16.208 --> 39:19.417
GOOD NIGHT, JO.

39:25.333 --> 39:26.333
DAWSON--
JOEY--

39:26.333 --> 39:28.542
YOU FIRST.

39:28.542 --> 39:29.792
NO. YOU FIRST.

39:29.792 --> 39:30.542
[SIGHS]

39:32.834 --> 39:36.291
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
ON THE SKI TRIP?

39:37.542 --> 39:38.375
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:38.375 --> 39:40.417
WELL, I HAVE
THIS FEELING--

39:40.417 --> 39:43.375
KIND OF UNSHAKABLE
FEELING--

39:43.375 --> 39:45.750
THAT, UH,
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.959
IT'S JUST A FEELING.

39:47.959 --> 39:49.375
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER ME

39:49.375 --> 39:51.250
IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO, BUT...

39:51.250 --> 39:53.500
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME?

39:57.417 --> 40:01.750
I'M ASKING YOU IF YOU
SLEPT WITH PACEY.

40:06.250 --> 40:07.792
IT'S KIND OF PERSONAL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

40:07.792 --> 40:08.375
I THINK
IT'S REALLY PERSONAL.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.375
I MEAN, WHAT IF...

40:10.375 --> 40:11.625
WHAT IF I WAS
TO STAND HERE

40:11.625 --> 40:13.792
AND ASK YOU IF YOU'VE
SLEPT WITH GRETCHEN.

40:13.792 --> 40:14.917
THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO.

40:14.917 --> 40:16.083
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.792
IT'S VERY PERSONAL

40:17.792 --> 40:18.333
AND IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS

40:18.333 --> 40:20.083
AND I APOLOGIZE.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.750
I'M SORRY.

40:22.750 --> 40:23.750
OK.

40:23.750 --> 40:24.291
I, UH...

40:24.291 --> 40:26.166
YOU KNOW, JO,

40:26.166 --> 40:27.625
I GUESS I JUST--

40:27.625 --> 40:30.291
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I'M NOT HOLDING YOU

40:30.291 --> 40:32.500
TO ANYTHING THAT WE
MIGHT HAVE SAID
IN THE PAST.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.041
OK? I MEAN...

40:35.041 --> 40:37.083
I WANT YOU
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE

40:37.083 --> 40:39.250
AND BE HAPPY

40:39.250 --> 40:41.208
AND ENJOY EVERYTHING
THAT GOES ALONG
WITH THAT.

40:41.208 --> 40:42.542
AND--AND...

40:42.542 --> 40:45.500
I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES
YOU MAKE A PROMISE

40:45.500 --> 40:46.834
AND YOU MEAN IT
AT THE TIME,

40:46.834 --> 40:48.917
BUT THEN LIFE
GETS IN THE WAY

40:48.917 --> 40:51.458
AND IT MAKES IT
IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP.

40:55.917 --> 40:56.667
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,

40:56.667 --> 40:58.708
IF SOMEONE
WERE TO TELL ME

40:58.708 --> 41:00.083
THAT WE'D BE STANDING HERE
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION,

41:00.083 --> 41:03.917
I WOULD HAVE REFERRED THEM
TO THE NEAREST ASYLUM.

41:03.917 --> 41:06.708
BUT THINGS AREN'T
EXACTLY TURNING OUT

41:06.708 --> 41:09.250
THE WAY THAT I NECESSARILY
THOUGHT THEY WOULD.

41:09.250 --> 41:12.291
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,
IF YOU WOULD'VE ASKED ME

41:12.291 --> 41:15.500
WHO THE FIRST PERSON
I WAS GOING TO HAVE
SEX WITH WAS,

41:15.500 --> 41:20.125
I WOULD'VE ANSWERED
UNEQUIVOCALLY...

41:20.125 --> 41:22.375
DAWSON LEERY, THAT'S WHO.

41:22.375 --> 41:25.333
AND THE POSSIBILITY
OF SLEEPING WITH
ANYBODY ELSE

41:25.333 --> 41:27.041
NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO ME.

41:31.625 --> 41:33.834
ESPECIALLY NOT PACEY.

41:34.625 --> 41:37.083
SO WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING, JO?

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
NO.

41:59.500 --> 42:03.166
I HAVE NOT
SLEPT WITH PACEY.

42:03.166 --> 42:03.625
YOU--

42:06.792 --> 42:07.166
OH.

42:07.166 --> 42:09.542
UH...

42:09.542 --> 42:10.500
OH.

42:10.500 --> 42:11.583
I'M SORRY.

42:11.583 --> 42:12.792
THAT WAS
A SIGH OF RELIEF
YOU JUST HEARD.

42:14.875 --> 42:17.375
I...

42:17.375 --> 42:19.667
UM...

42:21.875 --> 42:23.792
AH, WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

42:26.625 --> 42:28.291
GOOD NIGHT, JO.
