[audio logo]

00:09.134 --> 00:11.553
["deck the halls" playing]

00:20.478 --> 00:22.647
I could hear that
guy's bagpipe music

00:22.689 --> 00:24.691
through his headphones
the entire flight.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.026
All 13 hours of it.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.360
Welcome to Scotland.

00:27.402 --> 00:31.531
Aye, two of the
MacMistletoe mochas, please.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.907
Thank you.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.034
Are you sure we have
enough nurses to cover

00:34.075 --> 00:35.035
Christmas to New Year's?

00:35.076 --> 00:36.661
Oh, Merry Christmas.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.079
Not you, Anna.

00:38.121 --> 00:38.997
I mean, I do hope you
have a merry Christmas,

00:39.039 --> 00:40.623
but you know what?

00:40.665 --> 00:42.459
Let me call you back just
before the clinic closes.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.376
Hi there.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.629
Can I get a MacMistletoe mocha?

00:46.671 --> 00:47.672
Sounds delicious.
Thanks.

00:47.714 --> 00:48.631
Lindsay?

00:48.673 --> 00:49.883
Brad, it's Lindsay.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.551
Merry Christmas.

00:51.593 --> 00:52.510
Merry Christmas.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.929
Hi.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.056
Merry Christmas, Linds.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.515
Yeah, merry Christmas.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.350
Hey.

01:01.519 --> 01:02.687
Oh, that's for us.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.563
Thanks.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.273
He's--

01:05.315 --> 01:07.025
I'm sure you guys are tired
and don't feel like talking.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.276
I can find something else.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.695
No, your mom sent
a car for all of us.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.322
She timed the flights.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.032
And we need to catch up anyway.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.283
We haven't seen you since--

01:15.325 --> 01:16.743
Christmas at dad's.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.453
It's been a while.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.081
Yeah, I guess time just got
away from me with work and all.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.208
Your brother's in the
same boat at his new firm.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.876
His boss works him
into the ground.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.752
[phone vibrating]

01:25.794 --> 01:26.586
Speak of the Scrooge.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.712
Mm-mm.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.797
You're on Christmas vacation.

01:28.838 --> 01:29.631
He knows that.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.507
It's fine.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.175
No, it's not.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.594
You need to decompress and
get into the holiday spirit.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.597
I am in the holiday
spirit, Sarah.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.474
Hello.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.350
OK.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.779
[knocking]

01:52.821 --> 01:53.655
Come in.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.492
You wanted to talk
to me, Josephine.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.203
Yes, their
flight's just landed.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.872
They should be here
in a couple of hours.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.290
Are their rooms ready?

02:04.332 --> 02:06.543
Yes, Brad and Lindsay
are next to each other,

02:06.584 --> 02:07.460
as you requested.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.461
Thanks, Graham.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.504
Is that all?

02:09.546 --> 02:13.091
(SINGING) Oh,
tidings of comfort

02:13.133 --> 02:15.385
and joy, comfort and joy.

02:15.427 --> 02:18.847
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.228
Glencrave is supposed to be
one of the premier destinations

02:25.270 --> 02:27.355
for Christmas in Scotland.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.773
Yeah?

02:28.815 --> 02:31.151
Their website said the
Highlands are at their greenest

02:31.192 --> 02:33.028
during the winter months.

02:33.069 --> 02:33.945
Nice.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.779
Oh.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.116
I can't believe
your mom grew up here,

02:38.158 --> 02:40.326
and you two never visited.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.495
She never talked about
it much growing up,

02:42.537 --> 02:44.664
so it was never
really a priority.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.624
And what's with the
last minute trip, anyway?

02:46.666 --> 02:48.710
I had to cancel a million
things to be here.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.504
I think she just wants us all
to spend Christmas together.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.756
She couldn't have
done that in California?

02:52.797 --> 02:54.257
I don't know.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.342
There was something
different in mom's voice.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.010
I think something's going on.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.220
Well, it must
be something big.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.056
The last family
vacation she took us on

03:01.097 --> 03:03.016
was a Christmas folk
festival in the desert

03:03.058 --> 03:04.392
when we were teenagers.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.102
We stayed in a teepee.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.812
That's when she told us she was
taking that job at the music

03:07.854 --> 03:09.064
school in Santa Cruz.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.024
It wasn't a teepee;
it was a yurt.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.067
Right, a yurt.

03:12.108 --> 03:12.942
Mm-hm.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.194
What's a yurt?

03:14.235 --> 03:16.529
Mom's idea of an
upgrade from a tent.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.907
Oh.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.533
Or maybe she just misses us.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.827
Well, she thinks trapping
us in the wilds of Scotland

03:22.869 --> 03:25.872
so we can have this
whole Christmas kumbaya?

03:25.914 --> 03:30.043
She's going to have better luck
finding the Loch Ness Monster.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.587
["deck the halls" playing]

03:41.888 --> 03:42.639
Thank you, sir.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.313
Wow.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.690
Is this the hotel?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.233
Unless we took a wrong
turn between Buckingham

03:53.274 --> 03:54.984
Palace and Downton Abby.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.695
Wrong country.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.612
Why don't we see if there
are rooms under our names here

03:57.654 --> 03:59.239
before we alert Scotland Yard?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.573
Also in England.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.325
There it is.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.744
That's the sense of
sarcasm I missed.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.580
Hmph.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.416
That's one way to
slay a Christmas song.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.841
Oh.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.468
Can you imagine taking
care of a place like this?

04:20.510 --> 04:21.344
Nope.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.430
But it's incredible.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.181
Fit for a king and queen.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.851
Actually, generations
of dukes and duchesses.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.853
The castle's been in
the Glencrave clan

04:29.894 --> 04:31.813
for over 700 years.

04:31.855 --> 04:32.522
Well, come on in.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.314
The tour is starting.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.232
Oh, no, no.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.275
We're not on a tour.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.569
Welcome to Glencrave Castle.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.905
My name is Hamish, and I'll
be your Merry Christmas

04:40.947 --> 04:42.699
edition tour guide for today.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.744
The property dates back
to the 14th century.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.539
Here at Glencrave, we cannae get
enough of the holiday spirit.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.792
One Christmas tree
feels sad and lonely,

04:52.834 --> 04:56.129
so we have 30 right
from our own hills.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.798
And you won't have to hunt long
for a place to hang a stocking,

04:58.840 --> 05:01.676
as lots of our cozy
bedrooms have a fireplace.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.845
And I know what
you're all wondering,

05:03.887 --> 05:06.806
how does Santa have the time
to fill up all those stockings?

05:06.848 --> 05:09.225
Well, here at Glencrave,
we like to give

05:09.267 --> 05:11.436
old Saint Nick a wee
break and fill him

05:11.478 --> 05:13.438
up with mince pies and whisky.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.024
And there's plenty
of spare bedrooms, 22

05:16.066 --> 05:20.195
to be exact, just in case he
needs a short winter's nap.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.988
[laughs]

05:22.030 --> 05:24.616
But we're just getting started,
so follow me, lads and lassies!

05:24.657 --> 05:25.742
Hey.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.077
I guess we're
definitely on the tour.

05:27.118 --> 05:27.952
Tour.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.454
Thank you.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.414
But first, we have
the castle's keep.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.083
This was the first
room assembled when

05:33.124 --> 05:35.418
the castle was built in 1491.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.754
This was to be used
as a place of refuge,

05:37.796 --> 05:41.508
should the rest of the
castle fall to its enemies.

05:41.549 --> 05:44.886
All the pieces here at Glencrave
can be traced back to battles

05:44.928 --> 05:47.972
or have been gifted by
foreign dignitaries.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.391
If these walls could talk.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.476
I bet Christmas was
legendary back then.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.436
Aye, and also forbidden.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.814
This painting depicts
the last Christmas

05:55.855 --> 05:59.734
at Glencrave before the Scottish
Parliament banned it in 1640.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.779
For religious reasons,
celebrating Christmas was

06:02.821 --> 06:05.323
actually a crime up until 1958.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.534
You have the right
to remain cheerless.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.577
The families played
an impressive role

06:09.619 --> 06:11.996
in Scottish history while
looking after the community.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.082
You'll notice the
official Glencrave clan

06:14.124 --> 06:15.709
crest throughout the castle.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.878
The family has worn it proudly
for over eight centuries.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.383
Right this way, please;
still lots to see.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.343
Now we have the
upper foyer, which is

06:25.385 --> 06:26.803
a rarity in castles like this.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.685
Who's that?

06:33.727 --> 06:37.272
Ah, our most recent
duke, Daniel Glencrave.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.108
He, uh, passed away a
couple of weeks ago.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.318
Right before
Christmas-- how sad.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.903
Was this his family?

06:43.945 --> 06:45.572
Aye, it is.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.866
Well, next we have
the grand ballroom.

06:47.907 --> 06:52.412
Kings and queens have
danced its floors.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.164
You made it!

06:54.205 --> 06:57.042
Oh, merry Christmas, everyone.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.710
Merry Christmas, mom.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.502
My babies.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.920
Merry Christmas, mom.

07:00.962 --> 07:01.671
My babies.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.465
Oh, I've missed you all.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.551
We are going to have the
best Christmas ever together.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.094
Is this where we're staying?

07:08.136 --> 07:08.970
Yes.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.013
Wow.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.348
How did you pick this place?

07:11.389 --> 07:14.559
I grew up in the
immediate area.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.770
It's the best place in
Scotland for the holidays.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.147
Is this whole place a hotel?

07:19.189 --> 07:20.648
You could say that.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.777
We have 20 guest rooms
on the third floor.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.030
Tours run from 10:00 till
3:00 on the two main floors

07:27.072 --> 07:30.116
here and below, and guests
are free to roam the gardens

07:30.158 --> 07:31.659
and grounds as they wish.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.038
However, the rest of
Glencrave is strictly off

07:35.080 --> 07:36.623
limits to the public.

07:36.664 --> 07:40.543
Graham Frazier, Butler at
Glencrave at your service.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.711
Nice to meet you.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.172
How long have you worked here?

07:44.214 --> 07:45.757
Oh, 50 years.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.138
We really should get
you to your bedrooms.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.098
You must be tired.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.432
I'll sort your cases.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.684
This way.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.518
Come on.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.608
Now, you're in
here, Ms. Morgan.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.068
Oh, you can call me Lindsay.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.153
As you wish, Lindsay.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.321
May I help you to unpack?

08:08.363 --> 08:09.698
Oh, no.

08:09.739 --> 08:10.699
I spent my whole life
without a butler.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.033
What's one more week?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.785
Brad and Sarah, you're
right through there.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.744
Great.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.287
Dinner at 8:00
OK for everyone?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.831
- Yeah.
- No, mom.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.833
I'm-- I'm so jet lagged, and
the clinic is still open,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.084
so I was going to be
handling some calls,

08:21.126 --> 08:22.711
and I was just going
to grab something

08:22.752 --> 08:24.546
and maybe bring it to my room.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.507
I really need to talk to
you all about something.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.843
Well, can it
wait till tomorrow?

08:29.884 --> 08:34.597
No, you should have no issues
with Wi-Fi, and the password

08:34.639 --> 08:35.849
is on the dresser.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.018
Great.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.894
Good night, honey.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.230
Got lots of Christmas
activities planned for us.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.440
Can't wait.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.232
Thank you.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.365
Feeling festive.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.199
Trying.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.375
Oh, really, Brad?

09:02.417 --> 09:03.251
Hey.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.294
I've got your--

09:04.336 --> 09:05.128
Keys.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.338
Yeah, I have yours.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.299
This is-- this is
quite a sweater.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.760
Sarah and I are missing our
ugly Christmas sweater party

09:11.801 --> 09:13.553
this year, so she
must have packed it,

09:13.595 --> 09:16.931
figuring we could still use it.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.933
I hope you're not skipping
dinner because of me.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.019
This place might be
the size of Vermont,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.897
but we can't avoid each
other for a whole week.

09:23.938 --> 09:24.814
Right.

09:24.856 --> 09:25.774
No.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.858
Look.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.859
I think mom has
this idea that we're

09:27.901 --> 09:29.235
going to have this merry--

09:29.277 --> 09:30.737
Morgan Christmas.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.697
Exactly, and there are
all these expectations

09:32.739 --> 09:35.575
around the holidays for
families to play Secret Santa

09:35.617 --> 09:37.077
and be singing around the piano.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.788
And wear bad sweaters
and drink eggnog.

09:39.829 --> 09:40.747
Exactly.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.500
So let's just keep it cordial.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.085
Yeah, give mom the
Christmas she wants.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.962
Yeah, and then we can
just go on with our lives.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.339
- Works for me.
- All right.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.131
All right.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.007
Thank you.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.346
Oh, come on.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.473
Really?

09:58.515 --> 09:59.391
Can you hear me?

09:59.432 --> 10:00.809
I'm heading outside.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.477
Can you hear me now?
OK, great.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.770
No, but that's the thing.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.814
It wasn't due until
after New Year's.

10:05.855 --> 10:06.981
Right.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.441
OK, just look
somewhere on my desk,

10:08.483 --> 10:10.276
and just use my
electronic signature, OK?

10:10.318 --> 10:11.111
All right, thanks.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.494
Beautiful, eh?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.788
Yeah, it really is beautiful.

10:21.830 --> 10:25.000
I was referring to the lights.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.377
There's thousands of Christmas
lights here at Glencrave.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.295
Oh, that's-- that's
a lot of lights,

10:29.337 --> 10:31.548
and they are very pretty.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.966
Listen, if you're
sticking around,

10:33.008 --> 10:35.301
there's a big bonfire to
celebrate the Christmas

10:35.343 --> 10:36.761
solstice in a few days' time.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.388
I don't think I'll be
here long enough for that.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.015
Well, that's
not enthusiasm I'd

10:40.056 --> 10:44.269
expect at such an enchanting
time and place, the romance,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.479
the history, the lore.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.482
Glencrave's straight out of a
fairy tale at Christmastime.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.901
Well, that sounds
lovely, but sadly I

10:51.943 --> 10:53.737
don't think that's
the kind of Christmas

10:53.778 --> 10:55.989
I have in store this year.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.741
Hm.

10:57.782 --> 11:02.203
Even so, Nollaig Chridheil.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.663
Excuse me?

11:03.705 --> 11:05.331
It means merry Christmas.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.960
I'm not even going to attempt
that, but merry Christmas.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.431
Look what I got for Lindsay.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.432
Nice.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.433
Wait.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.476
You didn't even look.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.231
You know, you should try making
more of an effort with her.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.649
It's the holidays.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.109
You know how people
always say when they

11:33.151 --> 11:35.236
haven't seen someone
for a while that it's

11:35.278 --> 11:37.113
like no time has passed?

11:37.155 --> 11:38.990
You just pick right
up where you left off?

11:39.032 --> 11:39.574
Yeah.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.034
Yeah.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.827
That's not how it is
for me and Lindsay.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.287
I never understood you two.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.206
I mean, you were super
close as kids, right?

11:46.247 --> 11:50.919
Yes, we were, but
we're not kids anymore.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.837
It's easier for you.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.298
You do everything with
your sister and your mom.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.258
No family is perfect, Brad.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.803
At a certain point, the
statute of limitations

11:59.844 --> 12:03.056
runs out on everything,
including trying to rekindle

12:03.098 --> 12:06.434
a long lost bond at Christmas.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.144
Does that apply
to spouses too?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.779
I'm going to take a walk.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.281
[sentimental music]

12:29.290 --> 12:31.668
[sighs]

12:31.710 --> 12:33.003
Hey.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.295
You seen mom?
That's the fourth floor.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.296
It's off limits.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.048
Why is she going up there?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.258
No idea.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.011
Well, I'm going to
eat and get some sleep.

12:41.052 --> 12:41.886
OK.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.146
[bagpipe music]

12:55.692 --> 12:57.277
Where's the snooze
button on this guy?

13:07.495 --> 13:09.998
Ah.

13:10.040 --> 13:10.623
Oh, hey.

13:10.665 --> 13:11.750
Hey.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.792
Did you get mom's text?

13:12.834 --> 13:13.668
She's at breakfast.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.003
Sarah is still sleeping.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.504
Yeah, I'll be down
there in just a second.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.132
Wait, the fourth floor are
the private rooms, right?

13:19.174 --> 13:21.384
So don't you think it's weird
we saw mom going up there

13:21.426 --> 13:22.677
last night?

13:22.719 --> 13:23.678
I guess.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.804
Wait.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.306
So what, you're going up there?

13:26.348 --> 13:27.140
Yeah.

13:27.182 --> 13:27.849
Lindsay, no.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.142
Hey, just ask her.

13:29.184 --> 13:29.976
Lindsay!

13:33.063 --> 13:36.358
Hey, let's go, Nancy Drew.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.817
Are you--

13:37.859 --> 13:38.651
Can I help you?

13:38.693 --> 13:39.486
Oh.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.362
Um, hello.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.571
We were just--

13:41.613 --> 13:43.156
We were just
looking for our rooms.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.282
Yes.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.658
These are the private
quarters, ma'am.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.659
Oh, right.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.619
You know what?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.162
Yes.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.331
I think we must have
come up one floor too many.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.582
We did.
An extra floor.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.667
OK, sorry about that.

13:53.708 --> 13:54.501
So sorry.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.251
All right.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.675
OK, I told you
this was a bad idea.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.427
Let's get out of here before we
get caught for real this time.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.179
She came here for a reason.

14:06.221 --> 14:09.182
Lindsay, she said
this is a private area.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.100
Do not--

14:10.141 --> 14:12.185
I know, but I want to know.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.228
--go in there.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.481
There's mom's sweater.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.194
Look at this room.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.862
It is huge.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.739
We're not supposed
to be in here.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.408
Hey, this is a bad idea.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.200
Let's go.

14:27.242 --> 14:27.909
Lindsay.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.370
Look at all this.

14:30.412 --> 14:33.039
Wait.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.625
Hey, stop snooping around.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.252
Look at this.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.169
It's mom.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.004
What?

14:43.508 --> 14:45.468
Oh.

14:45.510 --> 14:49.639
Look at this, May 27, 1963.

14:49.681 --> 14:55.061
12th Duke and Duchess of
Glencrave welcome heiress.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.063
That's mom's birthday.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.816
(SINGING) Merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.234
Oh, hello.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.028
What are you doing in here?

15:03.069 --> 15:05.363
That might be a question
we should be asking you.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.824
Did you really bring us here
just to celebrate Christmas?

15:07.866 --> 15:09.367
You know how much
I love Christmas.

15:09.409 --> 15:14.080
OK, but are you a duchess
who loves Christmas or?

15:18.209 --> 15:20.086
I was supposed to be.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.422
What's going on here?

15:22.464 --> 15:25.175
Well, I suppose it's
time you learned the truth.

15:33.808 --> 15:34.642
Where are you going?

15:38.313 --> 15:39.939
I thought everyone
had gone to bed.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.317
I saw the car
lights from my window.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.278
The American's
outside, isn't he?

15:45.320 --> 15:48.073
You know how mother and father
feel about him, and the music.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.116
I don't care.

15:50.158 --> 15:50.950
I'm going with him.

15:50.992 --> 15:51.785
Going where?

15:51.826 --> 15:53.495
California.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.080
We're going to
travel with his band.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.290
But it's Christmas tomorrow.

15:57.332 --> 16:01.169
Please don't leave without
talking to mother and father.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.837
They won't understand.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.924
When are you coming back?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.384
You're coming back, right?

16:07.425 --> 16:13.348
This place, this world,
it isn't me, Danny.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.558
Despite your constant
irreverence to this family,

16:15.600 --> 16:18.395
this is who you are, and
you can't change that.

16:18.436 --> 16:24.192
When I sing, I feel free, and
I'm always reminded of the path

16:24.234 --> 16:26.736
that's been chosen for me.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.405
I don't accept that
anymore, Danny.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.740
If you walk out that
door, mother and father

16:30.782 --> 16:31.700
may never take you back.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.037
Don't go.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.962
Merry Christmas, Danny.

16:44.004 --> 16:44.754
I love you.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.177
I love you too.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.762
So there you have it.

16:52.804 --> 16:56.141
Glencrave and the title to
it are my family birthright.

16:56.182 --> 17:00.478
You told us your
parents had a sheep farm.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.356
And they died in a car
accident before we were born.

17:03.398 --> 17:08.611
They did die in
a car accident.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.696
After we were born?

17:14.034 --> 17:15.994
Why did you lie to
us all these years?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.620
It's complicated.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.414
Well, enlighten us, please.

17:19.456 --> 17:22.208
Everyone knows how
glorious Glencrave is,

17:22.250 --> 17:24.544
but I didn't fit in here.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.839
I just wanted to be
normal, but that was never

17:27.881 --> 17:33.011
going to happen because as
Lady Josephine, as the eldest,

17:33.053 --> 17:35.597
I was to be the duchess.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.183
So you just left?

17:38.224 --> 17:40.143
When I was 20.

17:40.185 --> 17:43.188
We moved to America,
started our folk group,

17:43.229 --> 17:46.149
and then our little family.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.984
So Daniel became the duke?

17:48.026 --> 17:49.527
Yes.

17:49.569 --> 17:53.073
It was a massive
responsibility I didn't want.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.408
Danny was much
better suited to it.

17:55.450 --> 17:59.245
In the States, I was finally
in charge of my own life.

17:59.287 --> 18:03.249
I wanted you both to have
that too, a normal life.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.751
Did you stay in
touch with him?

18:04.793 --> 18:06.586
For a while.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.964
Eventually, months
passed without a call,

18:10.006 --> 18:12.967
and then years until
then finally Danny

18:13.009 --> 18:15.512
and I weren't in touch at all.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.765
I did try and reach
him just recently.

18:18.807 --> 18:25.855
I wanted to see him, but
he died of a heart attack.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.148
Did he know about us?

18:29.943 --> 18:34.072
So you cheated him out of
knowing us and us knowing him

18:34.114 --> 18:36.074
and our grandparents too.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.952
I guess part of me
just wanted to protect

18:38.993 --> 18:40.787
you from my family drama.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.497
Protect us?

18:42.539 --> 18:47.419
Mom, you kept your identity
hidden all these years so you

18:47.460 --> 18:49.212
could embrace your true self.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.090
Yes, while the whole time
denying us our true selves.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.134
I'm sorry.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.887
It was wrong, and I will
live with regrets every day

18:57.929 --> 18:59.305
for the rest of my life.

18:59.347 --> 19:04.185
But it is my fondest
wish that this trip can

19:04.227 --> 19:09.190
be a moment of healing,
to all have a nice family

19:09.232 --> 19:10.900
Christmas together.

19:10.942 --> 19:15.739
You need this; we all need this.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.823
What I need is some air.

19:27.709 --> 19:31.046
You might say we're
known for our knight life.

19:31.087 --> 19:31.921
Get it?

19:31.963 --> 19:33.256
Knights!

19:33.298 --> 19:34.549
[chuckles]

19:34.591 --> 19:36.051
I heard the news!

19:36.092 --> 19:38.011
And to think I was in
the presence of greatness

19:38.053 --> 19:39.554
yesterday, and I hadn't a clue.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.306
No, no.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.141
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my
great honor to present to you--

19:43.183 --> 19:44.517
No, no, no.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.560
Just-- just-- just-- just--
just boring Americans.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.394
Yeah, nothing to see here.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.228
Have a good tour.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.355
OK.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.398
Such humility.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.233
I can respect that.

19:52.275 --> 19:56.029
I feel like I am in the middle
of some twisted royal tale.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.239
I know, but it's
actually happening.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.784
I mean, you go through
your whole life believing

20:00.825 --> 20:03.036
one thing, and
then boom, the rug

20:03.078 --> 20:04.371
is pulled out from under you.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.081
It's just so backwards.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.083
I feel cheated.
We should have known about this.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.834
This should have been
part of our lives

20:09.876 --> 20:11.419
if it wasn't for mom keeping
all these secrets from us.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.046
I know.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.255
To not have known our
uncle and our grandparents?

20:14.297 --> 20:15.340
Known about this castle?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.550
Look at this place.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.386
What do you think
will happen to it?

20:19.427 --> 20:21.012
I don't know.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.263
Sarah's back there with mom.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.307
Maybe she'll get to
the bottom of it.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.725
You guys OK?

20:25.767 --> 20:26.768
You seem off.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.937
Well, it's a lot to unpack.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.480
Do you want to talk about it?

20:30.522 --> 20:31.314
Not really.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.736
You haven't exactly been
part of our lives, Lindsay.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.446
Of course I have.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.032
You were gone before the
first toast at our wedding.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.492
Because you
booked your wedding

20:42.534 --> 20:44.869
the weekend before my med
school entrance exams.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.329
And you know what?

20:46.371 --> 20:47.747
You never even showed
up at my graduation.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.916
That was the
day before tax day

20:49.958 --> 20:52.127
and our biggest client was
going through an audit.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.712
I tried.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.506
I mean, the last time we saw you
was two years ago at dad's, and

20:56.548 --> 20:58.675
you never come to our ugly
Christmas sweater parties

20:58.717 --> 20:59.634
anymore.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.428
You stopped inviting me.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.888
Yeah.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.141
I'm going to change my flight.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.183
You're leaving?

21:07.225 --> 21:08.560
I mean, is there
a reason to stay?

21:13.815 --> 21:15.150
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

21:15.191 --> 21:15.942
Hey, hey.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.152
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:17.193 --> 21:17.777
Easy, lass.

21:17.819 --> 21:18.653
Easy.

21:18.695 --> 21:19.404
Hi again.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.321
Hi.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.031
Sorry about that.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.449
Bonnie's a Clydesdale.

21:22.490 --> 21:25.702
Very sweet, but also
very temperamental.

21:25.744 --> 21:26.703
I see.

21:26.745 --> 21:27.996
Do you-- do you work here?

21:28.038 --> 21:30.415
Glencrave property
manager, Mike Bell.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.458
I'm Lindsay Morgan.

21:31.499 --> 21:32.792
This is my brother, Brad.

21:32.834 --> 21:33.668
Nice to meet you.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.170
You too.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.713
Any chance you want a tour?

21:36.755 --> 21:37.672
I'm about to head out.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.007
No, that's very--

21:39.049 --> 21:41.634
Actually, Lindsay was
just saying that she

21:41.676 --> 21:43.261
would love to see the grounds.
- What?

21:43.303 --> 21:44.512
Oh.
And you?

21:44.554 --> 21:46.056
Yeah, I actually have
to get back to my wife,

21:46.097 --> 21:47.557
but I'll catch you later.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.602
I-- but I--

21:50.643 --> 21:51.978
Look, if you're
busy, I understand.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.313
No, it's just--

21:53.355 --> 21:54.647
I'm trying to book
a seat on a flight.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.024
Aye, aye.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.233
So you've come all the
way over to Scotland,

21:57.275 --> 21:59.027
and you're going
to leave before you

21:59.069 --> 22:01.029
get the opportunity to discover
your family and your land?

22:01.071 --> 22:04.032
Not to mention missing all
of our holiday traditions,

22:04.074 --> 22:06.618
which is the greatest ever.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.119
So you've heard?

22:08.161 --> 22:10.622
These walls can talk.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.498
You know what?

22:11.539 --> 22:12.374
A quick tour.

22:12.415 --> 22:13.583
Great.

22:13.625 --> 22:14.626
Yeah, just a
little, little tour.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.460
Come on.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.503
Up you get.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.712
Sorry.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.547
I wasn't exactly
myself last night.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.175
Things have been a little tense.

22:22.217 --> 22:25.345
Family's a lot, especially
during the holidays.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.430
You throw in 30,000
acres of history,

22:27.472 --> 22:30.100
and you're bound to
be a bit overwhelmed.

22:30.141 --> 22:30.975
30,000?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.811
This place is 30,000 acres?

22:32.852 --> 22:35.146
Did you know your
family has 30 bathrooms?

22:35.188 --> 22:37.190
Why does anyone
need 30 bathrooms?

22:37.232 --> 22:39.401
Oh, it's better than
fighting with your big sister

22:39.442 --> 22:42.404
who hogs the one
bathroom that you share.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.239
[scottish gaelic]

22:44.280 --> 22:45.407
What?

22:45.448 --> 22:46.825
Scottish for "crazy."

22:46.866 --> 22:47.701
Oh.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.413
Are you two close?

22:51.454 --> 22:53.081
Well, it used to be we
fought all the time as kids,

22:53.123 --> 22:56.543
but she's my best friend now.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.587
Actually, she's just had a
baby girl not too long ago.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.381
Oh, so you're an uncle.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.592
The greatest thing, having
a wee one in the family.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.845
This woods are the best
Christmas trees in the world.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.888
And you're responsible
for all of this?

23:08.930 --> 23:11.641
Call me a Mac of all trades.

23:11.683 --> 23:15.311
So this bonfire, is it for
that party you mentioned?

23:15.353 --> 23:18.273
The winter Christmas
solstice, yeah.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.775
It's a celebration of the
longest night of the year.

23:20.817 --> 23:24.529
It's a big thing at Glencrave,
with Shetland ponies, all

23:24.571 --> 23:26.031
the townspeople and workers.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.157
They bring their families.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.033
Right.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.955
So what do you do,
Lindsay Morgan?

23:33.997 --> 23:35.623
- I'm a doctor in California.
- Oh.

23:35.665 --> 23:36.666
A general practitioner.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.293
I run a clinic.

23:38.335 --> 23:39.461
Do you like it?

23:39.502 --> 23:40.920
You know, it's a
little bit more paperwork

23:40.962 --> 23:42.339
than I bargained for, and I--

23:42.380 --> 23:44.090
I do miss being more
hands-on with the patients,

23:44.132 --> 23:46.634
but the promotion was nice.

23:46.676 --> 23:47.969
Paper can never
replace people.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.512
You're right; it can't.

23:49.554 --> 23:50.180
And your brother?

23:50.221 --> 23:51.598
He's a tax attorney.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.475
Good to have one of
those in the family.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.477
Yeah, sure.

23:55.518 --> 23:58.605
You're not, um, close
with your brother?

23:58.646 --> 24:01.149
Well, I think we're
kind of maybe the opposite

24:01.191 --> 24:02.359
of you and your sister.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.528
We were really
close as kids, but I

24:05.570 --> 24:06.571
guess not so much anymore.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.156
Why?

24:08.198 --> 24:11.326
Maybe the best way to
explain it would be this tree.

24:11.368 --> 24:11.993
It's beautiful.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.287
It's strong.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.498
But the more you cut
away and cut away at it,

24:16.539 --> 24:20.001
eventually it falls down,
and it never grows back.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.837
We've just kind
of drifted apart.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.756
Well, I see things
a little differently.

24:24.798 --> 24:25.632
Here.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.929
You mind digging a hoe?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.681
Aye.

24:32.722 --> 24:39.354
Every plant, every tree that
I cut down, if you nurture it,

24:39.396 --> 24:41.523
eventually it'll grow
back stronger than ever.

24:44.776 --> 24:47.862
It's too bad this tree is
going to turn into firewood.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.114
It's such a perfect tree.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.699
I don't know.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.867
We could do with another
Christmas tree at Glencrave.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.202
Why?

24:54.244 --> 24:56.162
Because the 30 you
have aren't enough?

24:56.204 --> 24:59.499
No, we need one
decorated by you.

24:59.541 --> 25:03.086
I hope you stay till Christmas,
Lindsay Morgan of California.

25:05.714 --> 25:06.506
Whoa.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.465
Hey.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.384
Oh.

25:09.426 --> 25:11.886
Hey, Sammy.

25:11.928 --> 25:14.139
Another tree?

25:14.180 --> 25:15.890
Do you guys want to
help me decorate it?

25:15.932 --> 25:17.434
Why don't we put
it up in there?

25:17.475 --> 25:18.727
I'll go and get a tree stand.

25:18.768 --> 25:19.894
Yeah, maybe we--

25:19.936 --> 25:20.979
I'll just wait right here.

25:21.021 --> 25:22.355
OK.

25:22.397 --> 25:23.732
Should we try and--
- Yeah.

25:23.773 --> 25:24.566
On three.

25:24.607 --> 25:25.734
1, 2, 3.

25:25.775 --> 25:26.568
Yeah, no.

25:26.609 --> 25:27.277
We should wait.

25:27.318 --> 25:28.361
That is super heavy.

25:32.449 --> 25:34.242
This one for the
tree in the keep.

25:34.284 --> 25:35.285
What?

25:35.326 --> 25:36.619
The big ones draw the eye.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.079
It's what people
want to see, Lindsay.

25:38.121 --> 25:39.247
That's all you're
going to be able to see

25:39.289 --> 25:40.415
from halfway across the castle.

25:40.457 --> 25:43.168
Mom, I still don't
understand what

25:43.209 --> 25:45.503
was so terrible about
this place that you took

25:45.545 --> 25:47.047
a wrecking ball to your family.

25:47.088 --> 25:49.299
That you would keep an
entire branch of our family

25:49.341 --> 25:50.467
tree a secret from us.

25:50.508 --> 25:51.801
Lindsay, do you
remember how badly

25:51.843 --> 25:53.178
you wanted to go to med school?

25:53.219 --> 25:54.596
Well, of course.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.431
Imagine if I'd forbid
you from doing that.

25:56.473 --> 25:59.726
And, Brad, what if I told you
you-- you couldn't marry Sarah?

25:59.768 --> 26:03.146
I was told I had to go
to a certain school.

26:03.188 --> 26:08.026
I had to marry into
a suitable family.

26:08.068 --> 26:12.405
I was taught how to walk,
how to talk, how to wave.

26:12.447 --> 26:18.411
It was all about duty before
personal desires and interests.

26:18.453 --> 26:19.579
Yeah, but why not tell us?

26:19.621 --> 26:20.872
I mean, we would
have understood.

26:20.914 --> 26:21.956
Yeah.

26:21.998 --> 26:24.417
I should have,
but to move forward,

26:24.459 --> 26:29.673
I felt I had to close the
door on that part of my life.

26:29.714 --> 26:31.007
It was too painful.

26:31.049 --> 26:34.052
Jo, what's going to
happen to Glencrave?

26:34.094 --> 26:37.931
Well, as you know,
Danny left it all to me.

26:37.972 --> 26:40.684
But I can't run this place.

26:40.725 --> 26:44.187
I don't even know if I'm
welcome around here anymore.

26:44.229 --> 26:48.358
I think Danny knew that, so
he had a wish in his will

26:48.400 --> 26:52.320
that I spend one last
Christmas here at Glencrave

26:52.362 --> 26:55.949
and bring all of you.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.076
Mom, you didn't
answer the question.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.828
What's going to
happen to Glencrave?

26:59.869 --> 27:03.707
If you're interested,
I'll pass it down to you.

27:03.748 --> 27:08.128
You mean like we just
own it, just like that?

27:08.169 --> 27:09.713
Yes.

27:09.754 --> 27:13.466
You can live here
and run the estate,

27:13.508 --> 27:15.552
keep Glencrave in the family.

27:15.593 --> 27:16.678
Oh.

27:16.720 --> 27:17.679
Mom, this isn't Downton Abbey.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.180
And what?

27:19.222 --> 27:23.059
We just, like, become
a duke and a duchess?

27:23.101 --> 27:24.269
What?

27:24.310 --> 27:27.522
I have total control
of Glencrave now.

27:27.564 --> 27:30.233
Lindsay, if you want to be a
duchess, you can be a duchess.

27:30.275 --> 27:34.070
Brad and Sarah-- the same;
you can also hold the titles.

27:34.112 --> 27:36.114
And what if we don't want to?

27:36.156 --> 27:39.367
We just, like, put a giant
for-sale sign on the grounds?

27:39.409 --> 27:41.828
I'm meeting with an
attorney and an estate agent

27:41.870 --> 27:45.915
to weigh our options,
but essentially yes.

27:45.957 --> 27:47.876
And how would Danny
feel about that?

27:47.917 --> 27:51.171
Not good, but expected.

27:51.212 --> 27:54.758
Why does it feel like we
would be letting down a man

27:54.799 --> 27:56.634
that we know nothing about?

27:56.676 --> 27:58.053
I'd like to show
you something.

28:07.479 --> 28:08.772
What is all of this?

28:08.813 --> 28:10.357
Danny's work.

28:10.398 --> 28:13.109
He was an expert craftsman.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.945
He spent the entire year
working towards Christmas.

28:15.987 --> 28:18.782
He'd play Santa for the
solstice celebration

28:18.823 --> 28:20.784
and give it all
away to the kids.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.952
All the time that
must have taken.

28:22.994 --> 28:25.538
He always used to say
it was like Christmas

28:25.580 --> 28:27.374
all year round in here.

28:27.415 --> 28:31.002
He'd spend hours when he
was a little boy in here

28:31.044 --> 28:32.754
with our grandfather.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.631
Danny had a real gift.

28:34.673 --> 28:36.174
And he was generous with it.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.635
He had several serious
girlfriends over the years,

28:38.677 --> 28:41.137
but he never
married or had kids.

28:41.179 --> 28:43.848
He always took care
of everyone else.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.142
Why don't we hit the
town tonight, hm?

28:46.184 --> 28:48.186
The Christmas Highland
dancers are performing,

28:48.228 --> 28:50.647
and there is a wonderful market.

28:50.689 --> 28:52.816
We could get some
Christmas shopping done.

28:52.857 --> 28:55.527
All right.

28:55.568 --> 28:58.029
[bagpipe music]

29:03.493 --> 29:04.577
Wait.

29:04.619 --> 29:05.578
Is that Hamish the tour guide?

29:05.620 --> 29:07.497
Hamish is a Highland hunk.

29:07.539 --> 29:10.166
Lord of the prance.

29:10.208 --> 29:10.875
Wow.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.086
Look at those moves.

29:13.128 --> 29:15.588
How does he defy
gravity like that?

29:15.630 --> 29:17.924
Brad, Sarah, come on up here.

29:17.966 --> 29:19.259
The more the merrier!

29:19.300 --> 29:21.261
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

29:21.302 --> 29:22.012
Oh, come on.

29:22.053 --> 29:23.513
You know you want to.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.724
Are you afraid?

29:25.765 --> 29:27.600
Afraid?

29:27.642 --> 29:31.396
You did not just say that.

29:31.438 --> 29:34.566
Oh, let's go.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.818
Yes, come up, lads!

29:36.860 --> 29:37.902
OK.

29:41.740 --> 29:42.866
Nice moves.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.367
- None for you?
- No, no, no.

29:44.409 --> 29:45.326
I really don't dance.

29:45.368 --> 29:46.077
Oh.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.328
We should change that.

29:47.370 --> 29:48.038
No.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.290
Come on, let's go.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.542
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:52.584 --> 29:54.919
[laughter]

29:56.796 --> 29:57.589
Come on.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.716
OK.

29:59.758 --> 30:02.093
[laughter]

30:03.345 --> 30:05.889
You cut a fine
rug, Lindsay Morgan.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.640
You're not bad yourself.

30:07.682 --> 30:10.477
Until next time.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.854
Morgan clan!

30:12.896 --> 30:14.898
Thanks for coming to
our Christmas show.

30:14.939 --> 30:15.732
I'm honored.

30:15.774 --> 30:16.775
You were amazing.

30:16.816 --> 30:18.401
How did you get so good?

30:18.443 --> 30:22.489
Well, you might say it's all
about impressing the ladies.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.406
Oh.

30:23.448 --> 30:24.282
[laughs]

30:24.324 --> 30:25.992
Oh, look.

30:26.034 --> 30:30.372
Oh, we could make kissing
bells to promote fertility.

30:30.413 --> 30:32.582
I'm still hoping for a
grandchild in my future,

30:32.624 --> 30:33.708
you know.

30:33.750 --> 30:34.793
There it is.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.211
It only took you 24 hours, mom.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.129
An old lady can
wish, can't you?

30:38.171 --> 30:39.130
Mm-hm.

30:39.172 --> 30:41.591
Yes, and merry Christmas.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.635
Elspeth?

30:43.677 --> 30:44.761
Is that you?

30:44.803 --> 30:46.930
Josephine?

30:46.971 --> 30:48.682
Merry Christmas.

30:48.723 --> 30:51.434
Merry Christmas.

30:51.476 --> 30:53.937
This is my son Brad
and his wife Sarah,

30:53.978 --> 30:57.440
and this is my daughter Lindsay.

30:57.482 --> 31:01.069
This is Elspeth, my
best friend growing up.

31:01.111 --> 31:02.445
Merry Christmas.

31:02.487 --> 31:03.279
Hi.

31:03.321 --> 31:03.947
Merry Christmas.

31:03.988 --> 31:06.700
Merry Christmas.

31:06.741 --> 31:07.701
Come through.

31:07.742 --> 31:09.119
I will.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.537
We'll pay for these
and meet you inside.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.997
OK.

31:13.039 --> 31:18.294
I suppose we will
take all of these.

31:18.336 --> 31:19.796
Beautiful store.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.923
You always had an
eye for fashion.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.717
Thank you.

31:23.758 --> 31:26.970
So how have you been?

31:27.012 --> 31:29.973
All right, under
the circumstances.

31:30.015 --> 31:31.766
I'm sorry about your brother.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.184
He was a good man.

31:33.226 --> 31:34.728
This town loved him.

31:34.769 --> 31:35.812
I know.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.564
He was a man of the people.

31:37.605 --> 31:39.983
I missed you after you left.

31:40.025 --> 31:42.277
I'm so sorry I
never said goodbye.

31:42.318 --> 31:44.279
I knew what you
were going through.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.489
I just wish I'd
been there for you.

31:46.531 --> 31:51.578
Oh, Elspeth, you were, as
much as you could have been.

31:51.619 --> 31:52.495
We were 20.

31:57.334 --> 31:59.377
Are you all in
town for Christmas?

31:59.419 --> 32:00.879
We are, yes.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.380
It's so beautiful here.

32:02.422 --> 32:04.132
Oh, please say you're
staying for the Glencrave

32:04.174 --> 32:05.342
Christmas ball.

32:05.383 --> 32:07.010
It's the best night of the year.

32:07.052 --> 32:08.720
Sounds like fun.

32:08.762 --> 32:11.681
I didn't want to spring
everything on them all at once,

32:11.723 --> 32:15.268
but we can go if you like.

32:15.310 --> 32:17.520
We'll discuss it later.

32:17.562 --> 32:19.856
Your dresses are so
gorgeous, Elspeth.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.358
Oh, thank you.

32:21.399 --> 32:24.486
Brad, why don't you and
Lindsay go grab a pint.

32:24.527 --> 32:28.615
And just in case, Jo and
I can pick out a dress.

32:28.656 --> 32:29.491
Hm.

32:29.532 --> 32:30.867
Yeah, why not?

32:30.909 --> 32:32.035
Grab a drink?
- Yeah.

32:32.077 --> 32:32.994
Yeah, sure.

32:33.036 --> 32:35.205
Great.

32:35.246 --> 32:36.498
OK.

32:36.539 --> 32:39.751
Back in a bit.

32:47.217 --> 32:48.093
Hey, hey.

32:48.134 --> 32:48.760
Merry Christmas.

32:48.802 --> 32:49.636
Merry Christmas.

32:49.678 --> 32:50.637
Welcome to Salinger's.

32:50.679 --> 32:51.471
I'm Charlie.

32:51.513 --> 32:52.472
What can I get you?

32:52.514 --> 32:53.640
Well, what do you recommend?

32:53.682 --> 32:55.266
Are you feeling
daring tonight?

32:55.308 --> 32:56.142
I am.

32:56.184 --> 32:57.143
Oh.

32:57.185 --> 32:58.269
How about a Bad Santa?

32:58.311 --> 33:00.605
It's a whip cool,
bourbon, and eggnog.

33:00.647 --> 33:02.315
Too many of those,
and I will definitely

33:02.357 --> 33:04.150
be on the naughty list.

33:04.192 --> 33:05.318
All right.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.319

33:06.361 --> 33:07.987
Yeah, San Francisco.

Los Angeles.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.156
Ah, sunshine.

33:10.198 --> 33:11.866
You know, there's a
saying here in Scotland.

33:11.908 --> 33:13.201
We have two seasons--

33:13.243 --> 33:15.161
June and winter.

33:15.203 --> 33:16.830
And if we didn't
have Glencrave here,

33:16.871 --> 33:18.289
I'm not sure anyone
would make it

33:18.331 --> 33:20.000
to our wee neck of the woods.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.335
Does anything not revolve
around Glencrave here?

33:22.377 --> 33:25.422
Apparently all roads lead
back to our long-lost family.

33:25.463 --> 33:26.297
Yeah.

33:26.339 --> 33:27.340
Enjoy.

33:27.382 --> 33:28.508
Thank you so much.

33:36.599 --> 33:37.350
Thank you.

Thank you.

Ho, ho, ho!

33:48.028 --> 33:49.696
It's a wee bit strong, eh?

33:49.738 --> 33:50.530
Yes, but great.

33:50.572 --> 33:51.364
Thank you.

33:51.406 --> 33:52.282
Thank you.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.241
Wow.

33:53.283 --> 33:54.242
People are so nice here.

33:54.284 --> 33:55.785
Oh, they're so nice.

33:55.827 --> 33:58.329
I know, and there's no smog;
there's no cars honking.

33:58.371 --> 33:59.956
No 15-hour work days.

34:04.669 --> 34:06.212
So are you going
to tell me what's

34:06.254 --> 34:08.340
going on with you and Sarah,
or is it going to take

34:08.381 --> 34:09.758
another couple of these?

34:09.799 --> 34:12.552
It's still
complicated, Lindsay.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.220
I get it.
I know.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.264
I'm probably the last person
you want to talk to about all

34:16.306 --> 34:18.016
this stuff, but you
got to get it out,

34:18.058 --> 34:19.309
everything that's bottled up.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.560
You're not the last person.

34:20.602 --> 34:22.979
It's just not like
you and I have

34:23.021 --> 34:24.564
been in the feeling
sharing business

34:24.606 --> 34:25.774
for these last few years.

34:33.073 --> 34:37.077
Sarah and I have been going
through a bit of a rough patch.

34:37.118 --> 34:40.413
When we married, we
thought that we'd be

34:40.455 --> 34:41.998
better off just the two of us.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.210
Being children of divorce,
we didn't want any kids.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.420
Yeah, I understand.

34:47.462 --> 34:48.755
And it was a choice.

34:48.797 --> 34:53.635
But now, with the
window closing,

34:53.677 --> 34:56.638
Sarah really wants
a baby, and we've

34:56.680 --> 35:00.308
been trying IVF with no luck.

35:00.350 --> 35:01.351
I'm sorry.

35:01.393 --> 35:02.477
Yeah, yeah.

35:02.519 --> 35:05.939
So it's been really hard on her.

35:05.980 --> 35:09.067
And-- and to be honest,
I don't even know

35:09.109 --> 35:11.778
if I'm cut out to be a father.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.905
I mean, look at our role models.

35:13.947 --> 35:16.324
We are products of folk rock.

35:16.366 --> 35:18.618
OK, look, I don't think
folk rock is a prerequisite

35:18.660 --> 35:20.412
for being a bad parent.

35:20.453 --> 35:22.414
I think you'd make a great dad.

35:22.455 --> 35:23.206
Thank you.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.544
I don't know what
we're going to do.

35:27.585 --> 35:29.254
Well, you got to communicate.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.716
Well, sometimes
it's-- it's not so easy.

35:32.757 --> 35:35.510
I mean, if anyone
knows that, it's us.

35:35.552 --> 35:36.803
Us?

35:36.845 --> 35:38.304
What do you-- what
does that mean?

35:38.346 --> 35:40.640
Sometimes you can make a
little bit more of an effort.

35:40.682 --> 35:42.267
- So could you.
- See?

35:42.308 --> 35:44.144
This-- OK, that's-- that's
why I don't ever have this

35:44.185 --> 35:45.812
conversation with you
because you immediately

35:45.854 --> 35:46.646
go on the defensive.

35:46.688 --> 35:47.814
No, I don't.

35:47.856 --> 35:48.940
I'm just trying to talk it out.

35:48.982 --> 35:51.109
I mean, it works both ways.

35:51.151 --> 35:55.655
Lady Josephine abandons
her family for America,

35:55.697 --> 35:58.158
leaves the duke by himself.

35:58.199 --> 36:01.911
Now we either get
her or her children

36:01.953 --> 36:04.831
with no connection to Scotland.

36:04.873 --> 36:07.876
I shudder to think what
will happen to Glencrave.

36:12.922 --> 36:14.924
You know, you don't
look a day over 30.

36:14.966 --> 36:16.051
Ach, you're off your head.

36:16.092 --> 36:17.802
You're the one who looks bra.

Talk later.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.022
OK.

36:33.818 --> 36:35.862

until after Christmas.

36:35.904 --> 36:39.866
And we are too.

Just no more secrets.

I'm-- I'm going to get dressed.

37:00.387 --> 37:01.096
How's the pain now?

37:01.137 --> 37:02.722
It's getting better.

37:02.764 --> 37:04.265
We're definitely
going to the hospital.

37:04.307 --> 37:05.725
That's a couple of hours away.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.143
I can go to the clinic in town.

37:07.185 --> 37:08.812
Look, I don't
think it's broken,

37:08.853 --> 37:11.272
but just in case, does this
clinic have an X-ray machine?

37:11.314 --> 37:14.609
Not likely, but-- but trust
me, the clinic is just fine.

37:14.651 --> 37:16.903
All right, if this doctor
thinks you need an X-ray,

37:16.945 --> 37:18.363
I'm taking you to the hospital.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.322
If you say so, but--

37:19.364 --> 37:20.198
No buts.

37:20.240 --> 37:20.990
Let's go.

37:26.454 --> 37:27.247
Good morning.

37:27.288 --> 37:27.914
Good morning.

37:27.956 --> 37:29.541
Good morning.

37:29.582 --> 37:30.750
Is Lindsay still asleep?

37:30.792 --> 37:32.544
No.

37:32.585 --> 37:34.462
Mac fell off his horse, and she
went to the doctor with him.

37:34.504 --> 37:35.588
Thank you so much.

37:35.630 --> 37:36.548
Oh.

37:36.589 --> 37:37.799
I hope he's all right.

37:37.841 --> 37:39.175
She said he seems fine.

37:39.217 --> 37:40.093
So.

37:40.135 --> 37:41.177
Oh.

37:41.219 --> 37:42.595
Could I have some
coffee, please?

37:42.637 --> 37:44.097
Breakfast is served.

37:44.139 --> 37:48.518
We have black pudding,
kippers, smoked Arbroathies,

37:48.560 --> 37:50.520
porridge, and haggis.

37:50.562 --> 37:51.438
Oh.

37:51.479 --> 37:53.064
What's haggis?

37:53.106 --> 37:55.483
It's a local delicacy made
of tender cuts of mutton.

37:55.525 --> 37:57.819
Yes, we take a sheep's
heart, and we dice--

37:57.861 --> 37:58.653
You know what?

37:58.695 --> 37:59.779
Never mind.

37:59.821 --> 38:01.239
Can I just have some toast?

38:01.281 --> 38:02.615
Oh.

38:02.657 --> 38:05.160
Well, here in Scotland we
like a hearty breakfast.

38:05.201 --> 38:09.122
It helps to put meat on the
bones for the harsh winters.

38:09.164 --> 38:11.958
Now I get why you
moved to California.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.501
I'm glad someone
can laugh about it.

38:19.716 --> 38:20.508
Pure barry.

38:20.550 --> 38:21.384
Oh, no.

38:21.426 --> 38:22.594
His name is Mac.

38:22.635 --> 38:24.804
It's an old Scottish
saying for brilliant,

38:24.846 --> 38:26.598
as in what were you thinking?

38:26.639 --> 38:29.809
This is Lindsay, Dr.
Morgan, she did the splint.

38:29.851 --> 38:30.894
Nice work, Dr. Morgan.

38:30.935 --> 38:31.978
Thank you.

38:32.020 --> 38:35.148
This boy is accident-prone.

38:35.190 --> 38:38.401
Eight broken bones,
broken nose from a run-in

38:38.443 --> 38:41.821
with a rugby goalpost, and a
dislocated shoulder from trying

38:41.863 --> 38:43.490
to move a car off the road.
- Really?

38:43.531 --> 38:45.867
It sounds like you guys have
known each other a long time.

38:45.909 --> 38:48.745
Since November the 1st, 1981.

38:48.787 --> 38:51.206
Dr. Bell is my mother, Amelia.

38:51.247 --> 38:51.831
Guilty.

38:51.873 --> 38:52.832
Nice to meet you.

38:52.874 --> 38:54.292
Nice to meet you too.

38:54.334 --> 38:55.585
Wow.

38:55.627 --> 38:56.961
I bet you are very, very
busy with the nearest

38:57.003 --> 38:58.421
hospital being two hours away.

38:58.463 --> 39:00.173
Beyond.

39:00.215 --> 39:02.008
Well, thankfully we got Shelly
McGregor in on time last night.

39:02.050 --> 39:04.469
She had a wee little
lad, 12-pounder.

39:04.511 --> 39:05.845
Oh.

39:05.887 --> 39:07.639
For the 12 Days of
Christmas, apparently.

39:07.681 --> 39:10.016
[laughs] Yeah, I'm a
general practitioner now,

39:10.058 --> 39:11.393
but I worked in
obstetrics my first

39:11.434 --> 39:12.852
three years out of med school.

39:12.894 --> 39:14.229
I've delivered a lot
of babies round here

39:14.270 --> 39:16.189
who don't want to
wait for the hospital.

39:16.231 --> 39:18.483
Lindsay manages
her clinic too, mom.

39:18.525 --> 39:20.193
Oh, impressive.

39:20.235 --> 39:22.195
Well, no offense, but for me,
that's the most painful part

39:22.237 --> 39:23.655
of the job.
- I am so glad you said that.

39:23.697 --> 39:25.031
Me too.

39:25.073 --> 39:26.032
Well, managing
people is like herding

39:26.074 --> 39:27.200
cats, and the paperwork.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.201
Yes, and the red tape.

39:28.243 --> 39:29.411
And the regulations.

39:29.452 --> 39:30.245
Thank you.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.788
Exactly.

39:31.830 --> 39:32.706
I think you got lucky.

39:32.747 --> 39:33.707
Oh.

39:33.748 --> 39:35.500
Looks like just a sprain.

39:35.542 --> 39:38.878
But no more riding for a
while, and careful managing all

39:38.920 --> 39:40.005
that firewood for the solstice.

39:40.046 --> 39:40.880
I--

39:40.922 --> 39:42.424
I'm serious.

39:42.465 --> 39:44.009
Too busy to have you coming
through my door again.

39:44.050 --> 39:44.926
She is.

39:44.968 --> 39:46.302
I saw the waiting room.

39:46.344 --> 39:49.639
Well, long hours,
house calls, and the pay

39:49.681 --> 39:50.890
hasn't made me a rich woman.

39:50.932 --> 39:52.600
I need two of me,
but the resumes

39:52.642 --> 39:54.227
aren't exactly piling up.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.479
You mean you weren't
happy with the candidates.

39:56.521 --> 39:58.815
She's a wee bit of a
perfectionist, my mom.

39:58.857 --> 39:59.858
I see.

39:59.899 --> 40:01.401
But it is worth it?

40:01.443 --> 40:02.235
Aye, it is.

40:04.779 --> 40:06.448
I love this town.

40:06.489 --> 40:08.241
You know, it reminds me of
one of those little Christmas

40:08.283 --> 40:10.201
villages that you see
on top of a mantel;

40:10.243 --> 40:11.953
has all of these
cozy little houses

40:11.995 --> 40:14.247
and everyone looks so
happy and cheerful.

40:14.289 --> 40:17.083
Yeah, well, that's the
Christmas spirit for you.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.918
Hey, very cute.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.545
Oh, those are cute.

40:20.587 --> 40:22.922
They remind me of these
matching Christmas plaid

40:22.964 --> 40:24.424
pajamas my mom used to get us.

40:24.466 --> 40:25.300
Oh.

40:25.342 --> 40:26.843
Before my parents divorced.

40:26.885 --> 40:29.095
I feel like that was one of
the only times of the year

40:29.137 --> 40:32.098
we'd actually take
a family photo.

40:32.140 --> 40:33.767
I bet you looked lovely.

40:33.808 --> 40:37.145
Oh, well, of course I did.

40:37.187 --> 40:40.273
I just wish we were still
just as close as a family.

40:40.315 --> 40:41.983
Well, sometimes in
order to go forward,

40:42.025 --> 40:43.443
you have to take a step back.

40:43.485 --> 40:44.194
[phone ringing]

40:44.235 --> 40:47.781
Oh, speaking of my mom.

40:47.822 --> 40:48.656
Hey, mom.

40:48.698 --> 40:49.824
How's Mac?

40:49.866 --> 40:50.950
Uh, he's right here.
Hold on.

40:50.992 --> 40:52.285
I'll put you on speaker.

40:52.327 --> 40:53.328
He's doing all right.

40:53.370 --> 40:54.621
Thankfully, nothing's broken.

40:54.662 --> 40:56.289
Just my pride, Jo.

40:56.331 --> 40:57.957
JO (ON PHONE): Glad
to hear you're OK.

40:57.999 --> 41:00.168
Listen, Elspeth just called.

41:00.210 --> 41:03.129
It's last minute, but her
husband owns a distillery,

41:03.171 --> 41:05.256
and he's asking if
we all want to be

41:05.298 --> 41:08.968
judges in the annual Christmas
whisky competition today.

41:09.010 --> 41:10.220
You too, Mac.

41:10.261 --> 41:11.388
I'd love to.
Thanks, Jo.

41:11.429 --> 41:13.306
Wait, no, no, no, no.

41:13.348 --> 41:14.974
I don't know anything about
whisky, other than I like it.

41:15.016 --> 41:16.142
You're half Scottish.

41:16.184 --> 41:17.977
It's in your blood already.

41:18.019 --> 41:19.020
He's right, Lindsay.

41:19.062 --> 41:20.230
It'll be a new adventure.

41:20.271 --> 41:22.023
And free samples.

41:22.065 --> 41:24.859
OK, not too many free samples.

41:24.901 --> 41:26.277
I-- do you really
want to do this?

41:26.319 --> 41:27.487
- Yeah, of course.
- OK.

41:27.529 --> 41:28.113
You know what?

41:28.154 --> 41:28.988
We're in.

41:29.030 --> 41:29.823
We'll see you later.

41:29.864 --> 41:30.699
Yes.

41:32.701 --> 41:34.536
OK, I have no
business judging whisky.

41:34.577 --> 41:36.663
Mark Twain once said
too much of anything

41:36.705 --> 41:41.001
is bad, but too much good
whisky is barely enough.

41:41.042 --> 41:43.128
[chuckling]

41:45.422 --> 41:47.424
Ladies and gentlemen,
merry Christmas.

41:47.465 --> 41:49.259
Welcome to Kilbride.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.804
We've been making scotch
whisky here for 200 years.

41:52.846 --> 41:55.765
But today, it's all about
blending the perfect holiday

41:55.807 --> 41:57.851
spirit, a Christmas
whisky that will capture

41:57.892 --> 41:59.686
the heart of the
Highlands, maybe

41:59.728 --> 42:03.898
take top spot at the
Glencrave Christmas ball.

42:03.940 --> 42:06.693
Anyone can distill malted
barley into whisky,

42:06.735 --> 42:09.195
but by law, it can't
be called scotch

42:09.237 --> 42:12.282
unless it's aged in an
oak barrel in Scotland

42:12.323 --> 42:13.950
for at least three years.

42:13.992 --> 42:16.661
When the process we saw
downstairs is complete,

42:16.703 --> 42:19.873
the alcohol is poured into
these oak casks to age.

42:19.914 --> 42:22.625
44 bottles of scotch whisky
are shipped around the world

42:22.667 --> 42:23.960
every second.

42:24.002 --> 42:26.004
If a year's output
were laid end to end,

42:26.046 --> 42:29.841
it would reach to the North
Pole and back 60 times.

42:29.883 --> 42:30.633
Shoo.

42:30.675 --> 42:33.219
Who is ready to judge?

42:33.261 --> 42:35.764
[scottish music]

42:58.203 --> 43:00.872
Ladies and gentlemen, the
cards have been counted,

43:00.914 --> 43:03.583
the bribes have been pocketed.

43:03.625 --> 43:04.834
It's time to
announce the winner.

43:04.876 --> 43:06.544
Before I do, I'd
like to thank all

43:06.586 --> 43:11.424
our judges, particularly our
new friends from California.

43:11.466 --> 43:13.301
The winning whisky,
the blends that

43:13.343 --> 43:16.846
will be served at this year's
Glencrave Christmas ball,

43:16.888 --> 43:19.182
is 'Tis the Scotch.

43:23.395 --> 43:24.688
Excellent choice.

43:24.729 --> 43:25.772
Did you pick that one?

43:25.814 --> 43:26.773
That one was my favorite.

43:26.815 --> 43:28.858
That was so much fun.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.485
Hey, do you remember
the Christmas

43:30.527 --> 43:33.154
when we entered the
neighborhood hot cocoa contest?

43:33.196 --> 43:34.280
Yes.

43:34.322 --> 43:36.199
We threw everything in ours.

43:36.241 --> 43:38.368
Pretzels and marshmallows
and cookie crumbles.

43:38.410 --> 43:40.954
Peanut butter, and-- and--
and you called it the dirty--

43:40.995 --> 43:41.913
- Reindeer.
- Yes.

43:41.955 --> 43:43.540
Yes, dirty reindeer.

43:43.581 --> 43:46.042
I remember they came home
wearing it on their shirts.

43:46.084 --> 43:48.586
These two could get
so messy together.

43:48.628 --> 43:50.547
My mom would lose it.

43:50.588 --> 43:51.965
Mom was never bothered by it.

43:52.007 --> 43:53.717
No, you were all
about having fun.

43:53.758 --> 43:55.719
I just wanted you
to be yourselves,

43:55.760 --> 43:57.429
whatever that meant.

43:57.470 --> 43:58.722
Great job, Morgans.

43:58.763 --> 44:01.016
You're naturals.

44:01.057 --> 44:04.310
So Uncle Daniel, did
he ever host this event?

44:04.352 --> 44:07.022
He didn't just host
it; he started it.

44:07.063 --> 44:08.523
Really?

44:08.565 --> 44:11.151
Yeah, he loved whisky and a
good party, for that matter.

44:11.192 --> 44:13.695
The title comes
with a lot of perks.

44:13.737 --> 44:14.612
Oh.

44:14.654 --> 44:17.198
Duke perks, I like it.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.241
Yeah, they're good.

44:18.283 --> 44:20.952
But Jo will tell
you that Glencrave,

44:20.994 --> 44:23.121
it's not all play and no work--

44:23.163 --> 44:26.583
budgets, staffing,
farming, infrastructure.

44:26.624 --> 44:28.418
Hmm, never thought
about it that way.

44:28.460 --> 44:31.588
It's a big job, but the
payoff is even bigger.

44:31.629 --> 44:35.842
It's a rewardable role because
when Glencrave is a success,

44:35.884 --> 44:38.136
everyone's a success.

44:38.178 --> 44:40.889
It's what keeps our
little town ticking.

44:40.930 --> 44:45.268
Morgans, come try our new
whisky and fig Christmas cake.

44:45.310 --> 44:46.811
Uh, yes!

44:49.564 --> 44:50.940
Oh, Mac.

44:50.982 --> 44:52.359
You got to ease up
on the sales pitch.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.401
Yeah, I know.

44:53.443 --> 44:54.778
I'm sorry for piling on.

44:54.819 --> 44:56.613
I just-- I wanted
you to understand

44:56.654 --> 44:58.239
the reality of Glencrave,

44:58.281 --> 45:00.241
I know, but no one
here even knows us.

45:00.283 --> 45:03.036
And we wouldn't know the first
thing about any of that stuff

45:03.078 --> 45:04.412
you were just talking about.

45:04.454 --> 45:05.830
Yeah, I can help you.

45:05.872 --> 45:08.208
I know every nook and
cranny of this castle.

45:08.249 --> 45:11.795
Budgets, balance sheets,
Daniel taught me everything,

45:11.836 --> 45:14.798
and I'm not going anywhere.

45:14.839 --> 45:16.716
I'm here to help
you if you need me.

45:16.758 --> 45:17.926
Thank you.

45:17.967 --> 45:20.345
That really does mean a lot.

45:20.387 --> 45:23.640
But I can't just up and
leave everything behind.

45:23.682 --> 45:25.183
You know?

45:25.225 --> 45:28.228
And Brad and I, our
relationship is tenuous at best.

45:28.269 --> 45:29.145
And without that--

45:29.187 --> 45:30.480
You seem to be getting along.

45:30.522 --> 45:33.149
Yeah, it's better.

45:33.191 --> 45:38.988
It's just we have years
of walls built up, and I--

45:39.030 --> 45:41.074
I don't know that one
Christmas vacation in Scotland

45:41.116 --> 45:42.367
is going to tear them all down.

45:55.839 --> 45:56.673
Morning.

45:56.715 --> 45:57.841
Oh, Lindsay.

45:57.882 --> 45:59.092
You're up early.

45:59.134 --> 46:00.593
Are you going to
help me to decorate?

46:00.635 --> 46:02.554
I have to get ready to meet
Mac in a minute, but yeah.

46:02.595 --> 46:03.847
I have time.

46:03.888 --> 46:06.516
They're kiltness
shortbread cookies.

46:06.558 --> 46:07.851
Oh, so you bake.

46:07.892 --> 46:09.394
I am the baking butler.

46:09.436 --> 46:10.603
[chuckles]

46:10.645 --> 46:12.981
So tell me, how
has your trip been?

46:13.023 --> 46:13.815
You know what?

46:13.857 --> 46:15.275
I love Scotland.

46:15.316 --> 46:18.653
It's so beautiful, and
the people are just--

46:18.695 --> 46:21.406
Yes, they are
wonderful, aren't they?

46:21.448 --> 46:23.283
Yeah, they are.

46:23.324 --> 46:25.744
I think I've just been having
a little bit of a hard time

46:25.785 --> 46:27.495
digesting everything,
you know, all

46:27.537 --> 46:29.205
of the Glencrave family stuff.

46:29.247 --> 46:33.209
And Brad and I, well, you know
we're sorting through things.

46:33.251 --> 46:33.877
Aye.

46:33.918 --> 46:36.254
But I'm hopeful.

46:36.296 --> 46:39.257
I'm sure we've all
had our ups and downs.

46:39.299 --> 46:41.092
Well, I've seen
it all, you know,

46:41.134 --> 46:45.513
50 years of family dramas.

46:45.555 --> 46:47.474
Try this perspective.

46:47.515 --> 46:51.644
This morning, I decided
to try a new Christmas

46:51.686 --> 46:54.064
pudding souffle recipe.

46:54.105 --> 46:56.941
Now, every time I took the
souffles out of the oven,

46:56.983 --> 46:58.276
they fell.

46:58.318 --> 47:02.280
And the more I tried,
the worse it got.

47:02.322 --> 47:07.410
So I decided to take a
deep breath, a step back,

47:07.452 --> 47:10.455
and I made some freshly
baked cookies instead.

47:10.497 --> 47:11.831
So a fresh start.

47:11.873 --> 47:12.916
Aye.

47:12.957 --> 47:13.958
All right.

47:18.129 --> 47:19.089
Hey.

47:19.130 --> 47:19.964
What are you up to?
- Hey.

47:20.006 --> 47:21.257
Where are you going?

47:21.299 --> 47:23.259
I got a text from
Mac about rounding

47:23.301 --> 47:26.346
up some Shetland ponies for
the solstice celebration.

47:26.388 --> 47:27.263
Yeah, me too.

47:27.305 --> 47:28.431
Is Sarah coming?

47:28.473 --> 47:29.974
No, she's going to
hang back with mom.

47:30.016 --> 47:30.934
- Oh.
- Yeah.

47:30.975 --> 47:32.435
Maybe you should just go.

47:32.477 --> 47:35.021
I don't want to be a
third wheel on your date.

47:35.063 --> 47:35.897
We should both go.

47:35.939 --> 47:36.773
Are you sure?

47:36.815 --> 47:38.483
Yeah, totally sure.

47:38.525 --> 47:39.609
I'm just going to get dressed,
and I'll meet you downstairs.

47:39.651 --> 47:40.485
OK.

47:44.489 --> 47:45.949
Look at the Shetlands.

47:45.990 --> 47:46.950
They're so--

47:46.991 --> 47:47.826
Christmassy.

47:47.867 --> 47:49.077
Yeah.

47:49.119 --> 47:51.204
I was going to say
cute; that too.

47:51.246 --> 47:52.831
Shetlands have
always been associated

47:52.872 --> 47:54.958
with the holidays in Scotland.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.793
I like to think they
have some deep meaning,

47:56.835 --> 48:00.130
but really people just love to
see the little baggers pulling

48:00.171 --> 48:01.381
the kids around in wagons.

48:01.423 --> 48:02.924
[laughter]

48:02.966 --> 48:05.593
You know, they eat,
sleep, and roam together.

48:05.635 --> 48:09.639
Some can get ornery; others
are a bit more easygoing,

48:09.681 --> 48:12.559
but they always stick together.

48:12.600 --> 48:13.810
Have a look around.

48:13.852 --> 48:15.437
There's a wee cafe
just down the way,

48:15.478 --> 48:17.147
if you to grab something
to warm you up.

48:17.188 --> 48:18.314
I can meet you there.
- Sure.

48:18.356 --> 48:19.190
Great.

48:27.574 --> 48:30.201
It reminds me of when we
went to see Santa at the zoo

48:30.243 --> 48:31.619
that one year when we were kids.

48:31.661 --> 48:34.497
They put the red nose
on that reindeer.

48:34.539 --> 48:35.790
Yeah.

48:35.832 --> 48:36.750
That was a really
patient reindeer.

48:36.791 --> 48:38.293
It was.

48:38.335 --> 48:39.711
Yeah, that was the
last Christmas before mom

48:39.753 --> 48:41.629
and dad got divorced.

48:41.671 --> 48:42.839
Yeah.

48:42.881 --> 48:45.925
And we had no idea
what was coming.

48:45.967 --> 48:48.345
Just two kids
enjoying the holidays.

48:48.386 --> 48:53.516
You know, after they told us,
you really looked out for me.

48:53.558 --> 48:56.978
That's what big brothers
are supposed to do, right?

48:57.020 --> 48:58.480
Yeah.

48:58.521 --> 49:00.190
You were the one person
who made me feel safe.

49:06.237 --> 49:09.032
Why did you say that I
would make a great dad?

49:09.074 --> 49:12.577
You took care of
me like a dad would.

49:17.916 --> 49:20.669
Look at us.

49:20.710 --> 49:23.588
This is way more than
a cordial Christmas.

49:23.630 --> 49:25.048
[chuckles]

49:27.676 --> 49:29.678
These things are huge.

49:29.719 --> 49:31.638
I'm used to having just
a sprig of mistletoe

49:31.680 --> 49:32.764
hanging over a door.

49:32.806 --> 49:35.183
I can only imagine the passion.

49:35.225 --> 49:37.352
[chuckling]

49:39.104 --> 49:43.692
Sarah, I hope
I didn't overstep

49:43.733 --> 49:46.236
at the Christmas market.

49:46.277 --> 49:50.156
You and Brad would make great
parents, but it's your life,

49:50.198 --> 49:54.828
and you both have to do
what's best for yourselves.

49:54.869 --> 49:56.663
I just want you to be happy.

49:56.705 --> 49:57.997
Thanks, Jo.

49:58.039 --> 49:59.207
That means a lot.

49:59.249 --> 50:02.168
You know I'm
always here to talk.

50:02.210 --> 50:03.169
Hmm.

50:03.211 --> 50:04.796
Now I've got to
get to a meeting

50:04.838 --> 50:07.132
with the financial people
and an estate agent.

50:07.173 --> 50:10.468
Oh, so many affairs
to get in order.

50:10.510 --> 50:11.386
Thanks.

50:27.318 --> 50:31.156
Sometimes the simplest
things are the best.

50:31.197 --> 50:32.240
I know.

50:32.282 --> 50:33.575
Why can't everything
be like this?

50:33.616 --> 50:34.492
Hm.

50:34.534 --> 50:35.785
Mm-mm.

50:35.827 --> 50:36.703
What is it?

50:36.745 --> 50:37.829
I'm just thinking.

50:37.871 --> 50:40.498
I don't know.

50:40.540 --> 50:41.875
We got to talk.

50:41.916 --> 50:44.336
What are we going to
do about Glencrave?

50:44.377 --> 50:45.378
Oh.

50:45.420 --> 50:46.755
[chuckles]

50:46.796 --> 50:48.256
I don't know.

50:48.298 --> 50:52.218
I mean, I'm not sure I'm
brave enough to just dive

50:52.260 --> 50:55.305
into something like this,
just drop everything

50:55.347 --> 50:59.976
for a new country, a title,
especially after I just

51:00.018 --> 51:01.603
started this new job back home?

51:01.644 --> 51:05.273
And Sarah, I don't know if
she'd want to leave her family.

51:05.315 --> 51:11.905
But at the same time, there's
something about this place.

51:11.946 --> 51:13.114
I can't explain it.

51:13.156 --> 51:15.950
I just feel refreshed.

51:15.992 --> 51:16.826
And focused.

51:16.868 --> 51:18.244
Yes.

51:18.286 --> 51:19.329
You too?

51:19.371 --> 51:20.872
Yes, but are we
really just getting

51:20.914 --> 51:22.415
caught up in the fantasy?

51:22.457 --> 51:26.002
You know, it's Christmas
time, and there's a castle,

51:26.044 --> 51:27.712
and our family's secret.

51:27.754 --> 51:32.550
You know, are we just caught up
in the ghost of Christmas past?

51:32.592 --> 51:33.760
Maybe.

51:33.802 --> 51:35.595
Have you talked
to Sarah about it?

51:35.637 --> 51:37.097
Mm-mm.

51:37.138 --> 51:39.391
We're already going
through enough as it is.

51:39.432 --> 51:40.308
So--

51:40.350 --> 51:42.268
Brad, you have to talk to her.

51:42.310 --> 51:43.812
Yeah.

51:43.853 --> 51:47.273
You guys have this thing that
I have always hoped to find.

51:47.315 --> 51:52.529
You have this ability to be
on the same page in life;

51:52.570 --> 51:53.571
you get each other.

51:56.324 --> 51:57.450
Thanks.

51:57.492 --> 51:59.244
Thanks, but not lately.

52:02.247 --> 52:07.085
I think you need to
remember why you fell in love.

52:07.127 --> 52:09.921
You need to find that again.

52:09.963 --> 52:10.714
Thanks, Linds.

52:16.302 --> 52:18.013
Thank you.

52:18.054 --> 52:19.014
All right.

52:21.433 --> 52:22.475
Hmm.

52:22.517 --> 52:23.935
That hot chocolate,
it's looking--

52:23.977 --> 52:25.645
it's looking a little boring.

52:25.687 --> 52:27.022
[chuckles]

52:27.772 --> 52:28.940
It does.

52:28.982 --> 52:29.774
Right.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.406
[giggling]

52:36.448 --> 52:37.699
Butter all ready.

52:37.741 --> 52:38.783
- That's for you.
- Yep.

52:38.825 --> 52:39.826
Fantastic.

52:39.868 --> 52:41.870
Has to have some of this.

52:41.911 --> 52:43.246
[laughs]

52:43.288 --> 52:45.582
Last sprinkle for good luck.

52:45.623 --> 52:47.334
Merry Christmas.

52:47.375 --> 52:48.293
Merry Christmas.

52:53.214 --> 52:54.841
Mmm!

52:54.883 --> 52:58.511
Oh, it's just like
the good old days.

52:58.553 --> 52:59.346
Delicious.

52:59.387 --> 53:00.430
Perfection.

53:00.472 --> 53:01.348
[laughter]

53:01.389 --> 53:03.099
Wow.

53:03.141 --> 53:04.768
I see you've been busy.

53:04.809 --> 53:06.895
It's called a dirty reindeer.

53:06.936 --> 53:08.646
Do you want one?

53:08.688 --> 53:09.689
Why not?

53:09.731 --> 53:11.274
Yes.

53:11.316 --> 53:15.528
One more hot cocoa for this
fine gentleman, please.

53:15.570 --> 53:16.738
Oh, wow.

53:16.780 --> 53:18.531
Thank you so
much for your help.

53:18.573 --> 53:19.324
Bye-bye.

53:22.410 --> 53:23.036
Graham.

53:23.078 --> 53:25.372
Yes, miss.

53:25.413 --> 53:30.335
I mailed a letter to
Danny just before he died.

53:30.377 --> 53:32.587
Have you any idea if he got it?

53:32.629 --> 53:34.255
No, I don't.

53:34.297 --> 53:37.217
But Daniel used to
collect his own post.

53:37.258 --> 53:39.678
I could try to find
it if you wish.

53:39.719 --> 53:41.221
It's OK.

53:41.262 --> 53:42.472
I've looked everywhere.

53:48.478 --> 53:51.606
Thank you so much
for bringing us.

53:51.648 --> 53:53.108
Anytime.

53:53.149 --> 53:55.235
Hey, I'm hosting a party
tonight at Salinger's,

53:55.276 --> 53:57.153
just a few friends and family.

53:57.195 --> 53:58.321
I hope you can make it.

54:08.581 --> 54:10.250
Hi.

54:10.291 --> 54:11.584
How'd the kissing bows go?

54:11.626 --> 54:12.419
Great.

54:12.460 --> 54:13.878
And the ponies?

54:13.920 --> 54:17.799
Let's just say Rudolph has
a solid B team this year.

54:17.841 --> 54:19.175
Sarah, there's a thing at--

54:19.217 --> 54:20.260
Mac's having a party at--

54:20.301 --> 54:21.720
Salinger's, Yeah.

54:21.761 --> 54:25.056
Can we just have fun
tonight, like we used to?

54:25.098 --> 54:26.433
Yeah.

54:26.474 --> 54:27.434
Perfect.

54:27.475 --> 54:28.768
Great.

54:28.810 --> 54:31.271
[bagpipes playing]

54:39.279 --> 54:40.613
Just a few friends?

54:47.662 --> 54:50.123
Well, you didn't get
dressed up for no reason.

54:50.165 --> 54:51.291
Come join us!

54:54.002 --> 54:56.004
Lindsay, you're just in time.

54:56.046 --> 54:57.339
I could use your hand back here.

54:57.380 --> 54:58.006
Sure.

54:58.048 --> 54:59.716
Yeah.

54:59.758 --> 55:00.550
OK.

55:00.592 --> 55:01.885
What should I do?

55:01.926 --> 55:04.971
Uh, just pour and serve.

55:05.013 --> 55:06.723
These good folks
will do the rest.

55:06.765 --> 55:07.599
Sounds good.

55:07.640 --> 55:08.475
This is amazing.

55:08.516 --> 55:09.434
Yeah.

55:09.476 --> 55:10.018
Hey there.

55:10.060 --> 55:11.686
Merry Christmas.

55:11.728 --> 55:14.230
[christmas music]

55:23.740 --> 55:25.617
You sure know how
to throw a party.

55:25.658 --> 55:26.993
Aye.

55:27.035 --> 55:28.703
Well, it's go big or
go home in Scotland.

55:28.745 --> 55:31.164
You know, I never got to ask
you how you became the property

55:31.206 --> 55:32.624
manager at Glencrave.

55:32.665 --> 55:34.626
Well, my dad did it as
long as I can remember.

55:34.668 --> 55:37.003
I worked for him until
he died, and then

55:37.045 --> 55:38.505
Daniel asked me to take over.

55:38.546 --> 55:39.547
Oh.

55:39.589 --> 55:41.508
I'm sorry to hear
about your dad.

55:41.549 --> 55:42.634
Yeah, thanks.

55:42.676 --> 55:44.302
You know, you
mentioned your sister.

55:44.344 --> 55:46.304
You said that when
you guys were little,

55:46.346 --> 55:47.555
you used to fight a lot.

55:47.597 --> 55:49.724
Yeah, we were
very competitive.

55:49.766 --> 55:50.975
Right.

55:51.017 --> 55:52.394
Do you have any
regrets with her?

55:52.435 --> 55:53.520
Sure.

55:53.561 --> 55:55.730
Who doesn't when it
comes to siblings?

55:55.772 --> 55:59.609
The main thing is is
that we figured it out.

55:59.651 --> 56:00.568
How'd you do that?

56:00.610 --> 56:02.946
An appreciation
for one another.

56:02.987 --> 56:06.199
I think when dad died, we
understood how important family

56:06.241 --> 56:08.535
can be, and it does us
no harm that we live

56:08.576 --> 56:10.286
down the road from each other.

56:10.328 --> 56:14.207
We talk about everything.

56:14.249 --> 56:15.750
Dr. Bell, merry Christmas.

56:15.792 --> 56:17.252
Merry Christmas.

56:17.293 --> 56:20.088
And please, I tell
everyone to call me Amelia.

56:20.130 --> 56:21.297
We're all family here.

56:21.339 --> 56:22.549
Come in.
Sit down.

56:22.590 --> 56:23.800
Thanks.

56:23.842 --> 56:26.469
This is my sister Ayla
and her husband Thomas.

56:26.511 --> 56:27.846
It's very nice to meet you.

56:27.887 --> 56:29.180
Nice to meet you too.

56:29.222 --> 56:30.056
I'm sorry.

56:30.098 --> 56:31.391
Do-- do I know you?

56:31.433 --> 56:32.767
Have we met before?

56:32.809 --> 56:33.810
Uh, no.

56:33.852 --> 56:35.603
But I get that a lot.

56:35.645 --> 56:36.938
Huh.

56:36.980 --> 56:38.481
You've made
quite an impression

56:38.523 --> 56:41.568
on my brother and my mother.

56:41.609 --> 56:42.235
Oh.

56:42.277 --> 56:43.862
All right, boyo.

56:43.903 --> 56:44.904
Is it on?

56:44.946 --> 56:46.573
Oh, it's on.

56:46.614 --> 56:47.907
Hey!

56:47.949 --> 56:48.783
Here we go.

56:51.411 --> 56:53.413
May I have your
attention, please?

56:53.455 --> 56:54.622
Oh.

56:54.664 --> 56:57.250
Last year, I finally
managed to dethrone

56:57.292 --> 57:02.422
the master of the slip
step and skip change.

57:02.464 --> 57:05.842
But he says he wants a rematch
for the Christmas crown.

57:05.884 --> 57:07.260
Oh!

57:07.302 --> 57:13.141
And apparently he's
been practicing a lot!

57:13.183 --> 57:14.434
So what do you all think, eh?

57:17.312 --> 57:18.313
Are you ready?

57:22.150 --> 57:25.028
[bagpipes playing]

57:40.502 --> 57:43.380
What do you reckon, take
the dance floor or what?

57:43.421 --> 57:44.631
No, it'll take me two years.

57:44.673 --> 57:45.382
Come on.

57:45.423 --> 57:46.424
Oh, rubbish.

57:46.466 --> 57:47.425
Hey, come on.
Show her.

57:47.467 --> 57:48.968
- Show her?
- Show her!

57:49.010 --> 57:49.844
Come on, let's go!

57:53.098 --> 57:54.849
We have a new contender.

57:58.269 --> 57:59.145
Hey.

57:59.187 --> 58:00.313
What are you doing?

58:00.355 --> 58:01.815
I only know how
to waltz and tango.

58:01.856 --> 58:03.066
Not here.

58:03.108 --> 58:05.652
Here we do the Highland Fling.

58:05.694 --> 58:08.571
The what?

58:08.613 --> 58:11.116
What's happening?

58:11.157 --> 58:13.618
[energetic music]

58:43.565 --> 58:45.650
Hey.

58:45.692 --> 58:48.028
[cheering]

58:50.572 --> 58:53.199
It's the moment we've
all been waiting for.

58:53.241 --> 58:55.326
All those for Mac.

58:55.368 --> 58:57.912
[cheering]

58:57.954 --> 58:59.247
All those for Hamish.

58:59.289 --> 59:02.250
[cheering]

59:02.292 --> 59:04.669
All those for
Thomas and Lindsay.

59:04.711 --> 59:06.921
[cheering]

59:16.264 --> 59:17.766
Scotland forever.

59:17.807 --> 59:19.392
Yes?

59:19.434 --> 59:20.435
Oh, why not?

59:20.477 --> 59:22.354
Scotland forever!

59:22.395 --> 59:24.939
[cheering]

59:31.738 --> 59:36.159
I see Brad's come to
help me lick my wounds.

59:36.201 --> 59:37.035
What did you think?

59:37.077 --> 59:39.204
I think you fought valiantly.

59:39.245 --> 59:40.955
Indeed.

59:40.997 --> 59:43.583
Weird question-- what do you
wear underneath those things?

59:43.625 --> 59:44.709
It's OK.

59:44.751 --> 59:46.378
I get asked that all the time.

59:46.419 --> 59:50.757
You could be a true Scotsman,
but hey, I prefer shorts.

59:50.799 --> 59:52.425
So Mac was saying
that you might take

59:52.467 --> 59:53.718
over Glencrave with Lindsay.

59:53.760 --> 59:55.261
We're-- well, we're--

59:55.303 --> 59:57.847
We're not exactly sure
what we're going to do yet.

59:57.889 --> 01:00:00.934
Whoever it is, I hope
they're as nice as Daniel.

01:00:00.975 --> 01:00:03.228
He paid for our daughter's
eye surgery, you know.

01:00:03.269 --> 01:00:04.396
That's incredibly kind.

01:00:04.437 --> 01:00:05.814
That was Daniel.

01:00:05.855 --> 01:00:07.565
He came to this
Christmas party every year.

01:00:07.607 --> 01:00:09.109
He was quite the dancer.

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:11.569
Is that normal, for a
duke to hang out like that?

01:00:11.611 --> 01:00:12.946
Didn't used to be.

01:00:12.987 --> 01:00:15.573
Dukes and duchesses
were somewhat stodgy.

01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:16.783
Times have changed.

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:18.159
All right, everyone.

01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:20.245
This is the holidays
in the Highlands.

01:00:20.286 --> 01:00:23.873
Come on, enough of
this; more of this.

01:00:23.915 --> 01:00:25.750
Come on, let's dance.

01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:27.127
Yes, come on.

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:31.131
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:00:31.172 --> 01:00:32.090
Good night.

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:32.882
Sleep well.

01:00:36.803 --> 01:00:38.179
Thanks for bringing us home.

01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:39.389
Did you say home?

01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:40.724
I did.

01:00:40.765 --> 01:00:42.308
I meant Glencrave.

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:43.601
Aye.

01:00:43.643 --> 01:00:45.228
Sorry about your crown.

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:48.106
I bet you didn't know I was
such a fierce competitor.

01:00:48.148 --> 01:00:50.734
You can be on my side of
the battlefield any day.

01:00:50.775 --> 01:00:52.277
It was really nice
to meet your sister.

01:00:52.318 --> 01:00:54.446
Your mom is so great,
and your friends.

01:00:54.487 --> 01:00:56.239
It was really fun.

01:00:56.281 --> 01:00:57.866
I don't think I've had that much
fun at a party in a long time.

01:00:57.907 --> 01:00:59.701
You fit right in, Lindsay.

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:01.786
I am half Scottish.

01:01:01.828 --> 01:01:03.663
You're a bonnie lass.

01:01:03.705 --> 01:01:05.248
Isn't that what
you call your horse?

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:07.625
Aye.

01:01:07.667 --> 01:01:09.544
It means beautiful.

01:01:21.973 --> 01:01:25.143
That was really nice.

01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:31.399
But I think I probably need to
figure things out before I--

01:01:31.441 --> 01:01:33.401
Say no more.

01:01:33.443 --> 01:01:36.363
I'll see you at the
solstice tomorrow.

01:01:36.404 --> 01:01:37.280
Yeah.

01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:38.073
See you there.

01:01:38.114 --> 01:01:38.907
Hm.

01:01:52.712 --> 01:01:55.215
[bagpipes playing]

01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:23.910
Are you sure you
want to do this?

01:02:29.582 --> 01:02:32.002
Looks like it's going
to be a perfect bonfire.

01:02:32.043 --> 01:02:33.420
Aye, it will.

01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:39.342
Mac, about last night.

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:43.680
Let's just enjoy Christmas
and see how this goes, eh?

01:02:43.722 --> 01:02:45.974
I'm going to go
get ready inside.

01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:47.267
I'm looking forward to it.

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:52.188
OK, who's ready
to light the fire

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:53.648
and hear the Christmas legend?

01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:54.816
Come on, let's get in.
Come on.

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:55.650
Get down.

01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:56.568
Get together.

01:02:56.609 --> 01:02:57.527
Let's light it up.

01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:58.319
Ready?

01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:06.578
Whoa, whoa.

01:03:06.619 --> 01:03:10.331
Legend has it that tonight,
the longest night of the year,

01:03:10.373 --> 01:03:12.792
is controlled by the
troublesome spirits that

01:03:12.834 --> 01:03:16.671
roam the Earth,
spreading their evil

01:03:16.713 --> 01:03:18.631
to stop the sun from returning.

01:03:18.673 --> 01:03:20.258
Oh!

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.677
But we need to scare these
spirits away, so we can

01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:23.928
have the best Christmas ever!

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:25.430
Hey, hey?

01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:26.264
Are you ready?

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:29.267
3, 2, 1.

01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:31.603
[shouting]

01:03:35.523 --> 01:03:37.942
Ho, ho, ho!

01:03:37.984 --> 01:03:40.612
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:03:40.653 --> 01:03:44.449
Have you all been good girls
and good boys this year?

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:45.784
Yeah.

01:03:45.825 --> 01:03:47.827
Well, then you get
a present from an elf.

01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:48.703
Merry Christmas.

01:03:48.745 --> 01:03:50.955
Merry Christmas.

01:03:50.997 --> 01:03:52.791
Danny would love this.

01:03:52.832 --> 01:03:53.792
Aye, he would.

01:03:53.833 --> 01:03:55.043
I can tell you've been good.

01:03:55.085 --> 01:03:58.171
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:03:58.213 --> 01:04:00.131
You were really great today.

01:04:00.173 --> 01:04:03.635
Everyone here just makes it
seem so effortless, you know?

01:04:03.677 --> 01:04:05.929
They're just happy.

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:08.431
How it should be.

01:04:08.473 --> 01:04:12.560
This break from my boss
has been invigorating.

01:04:12.602 --> 01:04:15.230
You know, I haven't returned one
of his calls since the airport.

01:04:15.271 --> 01:04:17.357
The break from my
family's been nice too.

01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:21.403
And do you know how good it
felt to be appreciated today?

01:04:21.444 --> 01:04:24.406
To be called Santa
and not the tax guy,

01:04:24.447 --> 01:04:26.950
the same disgruntled
people wandering

01:04:26.991 --> 01:04:28.410
through my door every day?

01:04:28.451 --> 01:04:30.161
Yeah, it was fun.

01:04:30.203 --> 01:04:32.163
The bagpipes are
even growing on me.

01:04:32.205 --> 01:04:34.416
OK.

01:04:34.457 --> 01:04:38.753
Brad, we need to have
an honest conversation

01:04:38.795 --> 01:04:39.754
about where we're going.

01:04:39.796 --> 01:04:40.839
I know.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.340
Do you want to keep trying?

01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:48.346
Are you talking about our
marriage, kids, this place?

01:04:48.388 --> 01:04:49.264
I don't know.

01:04:49.305 --> 01:04:51.725
Maybe it's all the same thing.

01:04:51.766 --> 01:04:54.644
Can you see us here?

01:04:54.686 --> 01:04:58.523
In a way, yes.

01:04:58.565 --> 01:05:00.358
I never thought
I'd be saying that,

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.572
and I guess that is why
trying to have children

01:05:05.613 --> 01:05:06.948
has been so hard.

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:10.326
I just can't bear
to see you so sad.

01:05:10.368 --> 01:05:16.583
But no matter what, there's
one thing that I know.

01:05:16.624 --> 01:05:17.417
I love you.

01:05:25.175 --> 01:05:28.553
Just think, you could
celebrate this every year.

01:05:28.595 --> 01:05:31.056
I see the way your family's
embracing Glencrave.

01:05:31.097 --> 01:05:33.099
You're very persistent.

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:35.060
How many people can
literally say they've been

01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:37.312
given the keys to the castle?

01:05:37.354 --> 01:05:39.022
It's the gift of a lifetime.

01:05:39.064 --> 01:05:41.608
This isn't real life
for someone like me.

01:05:41.649 --> 01:05:42.817
Well, who makes the rules?

01:05:42.859 --> 01:05:44.361
And what's real
life and what's not?

01:05:44.402 --> 01:05:46.654
It's whatever we want it to be.

01:05:46.696 --> 01:05:48.114
Hm?

01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:50.075
My mom needs a
partner at the clinic.

01:05:50.116 --> 01:05:56.164
Glencrave, the people,
we have fallen for you.

01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:02.045
It's yours for the
taking, Lindsay--

01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:04.923
all of it.

01:06:04.964 --> 01:06:07.258
You said it yourself, though.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.053
Glencrave at Christmas
time is a fairy tale,

01:06:10.095 --> 01:06:16.267
and fairy tales aren't real.

01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:17.477
Well, maybe we are.

01:06:36.204 --> 01:06:40.542
And now form the kneaded dough
into a circle, just like that.

01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:44.754
Yule bread symbolizes the sun
in the darkest days of winter.

01:06:44.796 --> 01:06:47.716
You know, when Christmas
was banned in Scotland,

01:06:47.757 --> 01:06:50.885
bakers had to pass along
the names of all those

01:06:50.927 --> 01:06:53.596
who asked for a yule
loaf to the police.

01:06:53.638 --> 01:06:55.890
Now, what we're
going to do is we're

01:06:55.932 --> 01:06:59.310
going to hide this wee
Scottie dog in the dough

01:06:59.352 --> 01:07:00.895
and bake it inside.

01:07:00.937 --> 01:07:02.939
And whichever family
member finds it,

01:07:02.981 --> 01:07:05.734
they'll have good
luck all year long.

01:07:05.775 --> 01:07:07.569
Now, who would like
to do the honors?

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:08.403
Um.

01:07:08.445 --> 01:07:09.279
I will.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.156
Brad?

01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:12.615
Well, of course.

01:07:12.657 --> 01:07:14.367
Please pick one.

01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:15.410
Thank you.

01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:16.411
[phone ringing]

01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:17.829
Oh.

01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:19.247
Hi, it's Jo.

01:07:19.289 --> 01:07:21.624
Now, just leave those
to rise for a while.

01:07:21.666 --> 01:07:22.917
I'll be back shortly.

01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:24.919
OK.

01:07:24.961 --> 01:07:28.590
Remember when you used
to bake all the time?

01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:32.635
I miss your candy
cane sugar cookies.

01:07:32.677 --> 01:07:34.721
I can make those for you.

01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:37.390
Yeah?

01:07:37.432 --> 01:07:40.894
What if we let whatever's
going to happen happen

01:07:40.935 --> 01:07:44.606
and just be us for a change?

01:07:44.647 --> 01:07:48.234
Being together is
what matters, right?

01:07:48.276 --> 01:07:49.402
I love you.

01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:50.320
I love you too.

01:07:56.534 --> 01:07:59.120
That was the real
estate attorney.

01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:02.916
He's advising we subdivide
the estate and break it up.

01:08:02.957 --> 01:08:05.835
He says we'll have more
buyers interested that way.

01:08:05.877 --> 01:08:08.213
Now, what about
the town, the people?

01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.802
We need to talk to Lindsay.

01:08:13.843 --> 01:08:18.932
Now, this evening's cocktail
is a Highland Snowball--

01:08:18.973 --> 01:08:20.767
eggnog with a hint of whisky.

01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:21.643
Thank you, Graham.

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:23.269
You're welcome.

01:08:23.311 --> 01:08:25.814
So, Mom, are you really
going to break up the estate?

01:08:25.855 --> 01:08:27.774
I don't have it
in me to run it.

01:08:27.816 --> 01:08:29.609
And since it's so
new to you both, I--

01:08:29.651 --> 01:08:32.153
I just wanted to know your
thoughts before I do anything.

01:08:32.195 --> 01:08:35.490
Well, we think we should
keep Glencrave in the family.

01:08:35.532 --> 01:08:38.827
There's no way we can
allow it to be carved up.

01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:40.870
It would take away the
heart of this entire area.

01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:42.914
And this estate is
responsible for the livelihood

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:45.000
of so many people.

01:08:45.041 --> 01:08:46.793
What's going to happen
to all the families

01:08:46.835 --> 01:08:47.961
who work on the property?

01:08:48.003 --> 01:08:49.963
How could this work?

01:08:50.005 --> 01:08:51.506
I don't know.

01:08:51.548 --> 01:08:53.550
It's not exactly like we
know anything about managing

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:55.093
a property this size.

01:08:55.135 --> 01:08:58.013
Maybe we could hire someone
to look after it, and--

01:08:58.054 --> 01:09:00.849
and then visit whenever
we need to or want to.

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:03.184
Mac knows everything
about Glencrave,

01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:06.229
and he's been offering to help.

01:09:06.271 --> 01:09:07.355
Mom?

01:09:07.397 --> 01:09:09.399
I like it.

01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:11.526
Great.

01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:12.694
To new beginnings.

01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:15.572
To new beginnings.

01:09:15.613 --> 01:09:16.406
Oh!

01:09:19.034 --> 01:09:21.161
A text from Lindsay.

01:09:21.202 --> 01:09:23.371
Mac's in.

01:09:23.413 --> 01:09:24.622
Great!

01:09:24.664 --> 01:09:26.750
What can I get
you tonight, eh?

01:09:26.791 --> 01:09:28.209
Guinness for me, please.

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:29.961
I'll have a Scottish sparkle.

01:09:30.003 --> 01:09:31.504
Oh, that's perfect.

01:09:31.546 --> 01:09:34.174
So have you decided what
you're doing with Glencrave?

01:09:34.215 --> 01:09:36.009
It's the million dollar
question around here.

01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:37.594
We're keeping
it in the family,

01:09:37.635 --> 01:09:39.304
and Mac's going
to run it for us.

01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:41.973
But you'll be the
duke and duchess.

01:09:42.015 --> 01:09:44.392
I'm not even sure we
deserve titles like that.

01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:45.518
My two pence?

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.228
Sure.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.732
Castles and titles aren't
what make Glencrave special.

01:09:50.774 --> 01:09:52.734
It's blood.

01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:54.402
You're part of a family
that has survived

01:09:54.444 --> 01:09:58.740
500 years of royal feuds
and revolutions, plagues,

01:09:58.782 --> 01:10:02.077
floods, and even famines.

01:10:02.118 --> 01:10:05.038
But through it all, your
family has taken care

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.123
of this town and its people.

01:10:07.165 --> 01:10:10.835
You have the soul of Glencrave
coursing through your veins,

01:10:10.877 --> 01:10:13.171
and that's a very
sacred thing here.

01:10:20.011 --> 01:10:22.597
Now, I hope everyone is
excited about attending

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:23.973
the ball this evening.

01:10:24.015 --> 01:10:25.558
Yes, I'm getting a
dress today from Elspeth.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.476
Lovely.

01:10:26.518 --> 01:10:27.936
Just one final point--

01:10:27.977 --> 01:10:29.646
how would people
like to be announced

01:10:29.688 --> 01:10:31.106
as they make their entrance?

01:10:31.147 --> 01:10:32.899
Jo Morgan is fine with me.

01:10:32.941 --> 01:10:34.359
Lindsay Morgan works.

01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:37.946
So we've been thinking
a lot about what

01:10:37.987 --> 01:10:40.073
we discussed last night.

01:10:40.115 --> 01:10:41.574
We barely slept.

01:10:41.616 --> 01:10:45.537
We want to take the
titles of duke and duchess

01:10:45.578 --> 01:10:47.247
and move to Glencrave.

01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:53.837
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:10:53.878 --> 01:10:59.175
I-- I can make the announcement
myself at the ball tonight.

01:10:59.217 --> 01:11:00.135
Great.

01:11:00.176 --> 01:11:01.469
I thought we had a plan.

01:11:01.511 --> 01:11:03.471
We do.

01:11:03.513 --> 01:11:05.306
You could move here too.

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:07.809
But you just
made this decision

01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:09.894
without even talking to me?

01:11:09.936 --> 01:11:12.355
Brad, you're going to
move to another country

01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:15.358
and just expect
me to follow suit?

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.068
I thought we were
in this together.

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:20.864
We are in this together.

01:11:20.905 --> 01:11:21.865
Lindsay, wait.

01:11:21.906 --> 01:11:23.158
You know what?

01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:25.744
Nothing in this
family ever changes.

01:11:25.785 --> 01:11:26.536
Lindsay.

01:11:34.252 --> 01:11:36.504
Merry Christmas Eve, Danny.

01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:38.673
We'll miss you at
the ball tonight.

01:11:38.715 --> 01:11:42.302
I can just imagine you're there,
life and soul of the party.

01:11:42.344 --> 01:11:45.138
We're all here for Christmas,
just as you wanted.

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.724
No surprise, there's
a family drama,

01:11:47.766 --> 01:11:50.518
but we'll get through that.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.646
I'm sorry, Danny.

01:11:53.688 --> 01:11:54.647
for everything.

01:11:57.734 --> 01:11:58.777
I love you with all my heart.

01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:05.575
So this is our family, huh?

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:10.080
The entire Glencrave clan.

01:12:10.121 --> 01:12:12.040
I know this is
really hard for you.

01:12:12.082 --> 01:12:13.083
I'm so sorry.

01:12:22.509 --> 01:12:23.635
Are you doing OK?

01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:24.844
I don't know.

01:12:24.886 --> 01:12:26.429
Here I am thinking
that Brad and I

01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:27.931
are going to have
this new start,

01:12:27.972 --> 01:12:31.101
and now he's moving to Scotland.

01:12:31.142 --> 01:12:34.312
You should be happy for
them, and for Glencrave

01:12:34.354 --> 01:12:35.563
and all the people here.

01:12:35.605 --> 01:12:37.065
Yeah, I think I'm
just worried we're

01:12:37.107 --> 01:12:40.068
going to drift apart again.

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:42.112
I mean, how can we do
this together if he's here

01:12:42.153 --> 01:12:43.029
and I'm not?

01:12:43.071 --> 01:12:45.240
Oh, sweetheart.

01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:49.536
It's not about where you live;
it's about the effort you make.

01:12:49.577 --> 01:12:51.746
If my relationship with
Danny has taught me anything,

01:12:51.788 --> 01:12:52.622
it's that.

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:59.713
You know, I sent him a
letter right before he died.

01:12:59.754 --> 01:13:03.633
I told him I was sorry,
that I loved him,

01:13:03.675 --> 01:13:05.385
and that I wanted
to see him again.

01:13:07.804 --> 01:13:09.931
But then he died.

01:13:09.973 --> 01:13:12.100
Now, I have to live
with what I did.

01:13:12.142 --> 01:13:14.310
You followed your heart.

01:13:14.352 --> 01:13:16.312
You can never go wrong.

01:13:16.354 --> 01:13:18.231
Thanks.

01:13:18.273 --> 01:13:20.025
Just don't have regrets.

01:13:20.066 --> 01:13:22.861
You and Brad always had
a special relationship.

01:13:22.902 --> 01:13:25.822
Honestly, after the divorce,
he was more of a parent

01:13:25.864 --> 01:13:27.323
to you than I was at times.

01:13:27.365 --> 01:13:33.121
He is a good man, but you
are a great mom who went

01:13:33.163 --> 01:13:36.124
through a really hard thing.

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:37.792
I love you so much, mom.

01:13:37.834 --> 01:13:41.963
Oh, I love you too.

01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:44.382
Please say you'll go tonight.

01:13:44.424 --> 01:13:46.885
I just want us all
to be together.

01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:48.887
It can be my Christmas present.

01:13:48.928 --> 01:13:51.348
[laughs]

01:13:53.558 --> 01:13:54.559
Mac.

01:13:54.601 --> 01:13:57.103
Looks like we
have the same idea--

01:13:57.145 --> 01:13:58.772
last minute Christmas shopping.

01:13:58.813 --> 01:14:00.315
Yeah.

01:14:00.357 --> 01:14:03.985
Listen, Brad tells me
he and Sarah are staying.

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:04.778
They are.

01:14:04.819 --> 01:14:06.196
yeah.

01:14:06.237 --> 01:14:09.491
Do you want to
sit for a moment?

01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:11.076
Sure.

01:14:11.117 --> 01:14:12.243
So?

01:14:12.285 --> 01:14:15.997
I'm going back to California.

01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:17.874
Just like that?

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:19.751
It wasn't an easy decision.

01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:22.170
Can I ask you something?

01:14:22.212 --> 01:14:25.590
What's really important to you?

01:14:25.632 --> 01:14:28.051
My family.

01:14:28.093 --> 01:14:29.594
Well, your brother's
staying here.

01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:30.470
What else?

01:14:33.306 --> 01:14:35.392
My patients.

01:14:35.433 --> 01:14:37.769
I love seeing the difference
I can make in their lives.

01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:40.313
You know how valuable
you can be to this town.

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:42.273
You can make a difference here.

01:14:42.315 --> 01:14:47.904
I mean, I know you have for me.

01:14:47.946 --> 01:14:50.949
I hope you follow your heart.

01:15:08.174 --> 01:15:08.925
Come in.

01:15:12.262 --> 01:15:13.513
Danny would be proud of you.

01:15:13.555 --> 01:15:14.931
You think so?

01:15:14.973 --> 01:15:16.808
Well, you're keeping
Glencrave in the family

01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:19.686
with those amazing
children of yours.

01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:21.813
They have the biggest
of hearts, Jo.

01:15:21.855 --> 01:15:25.984
I found the letter that
you wrote to Daniel.

01:15:26.026 --> 01:15:28.361
He kept it in a
special wee box here.

01:15:28.403 --> 01:15:29.487
He opened it?

01:15:29.529 --> 01:15:31.740
So it appears.

01:15:31.781 --> 01:15:34.242
I also found this.

01:15:34.284 --> 01:15:35.076
It's for you.

01:15:39.414 --> 01:15:40.874
I'm almost afraid
to look at it.

01:15:40.915 --> 01:15:42.876
And I'm afraid that you'll
regret it for the rest

01:15:42.917 --> 01:15:44.627
of your life if you don't.

01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:47.088
[sentimental music]

01:16:00.769 --> 01:16:01.728
Are you all right?

01:16:06.566 --> 01:16:08.651
He forgave me!

01:16:08.693 --> 01:16:09.736
As is right.

01:16:16.242 --> 01:16:21.289
Presenting Frank and Moira,
Duke and Duchess of Dundee.

01:16:21.331 --> 01:16:24.209
Presenting Graham Fraser
and Josephine Morgan.

01:16:28.505 --> 01:16:30.048
You look beautiful, Sarah.

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:31.508
Oh, thanks, Mac.

01:16:31.549 --> 01:16:33.843
Brad, the coat
looks good on you.

01:16:33.885 --> 01:16:35.512
I went with the shorts.

01:16:35.553 --> 01:16:36.388
Good call.

01:16:36.429 --> 01:16:37.889
Thank you.

01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:39.891
Have you seen Lindsay?

01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:41.601
I'm not sure if she's coming.

01:16:41.643 --> 01:16:43.603
I haven't talked to
her since this morning.

01:16:43.645 --> 01:16:45.313
I know you'll work things out.

01:16:45.355 --> 01:16:46.147
Enjoy the night.

01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.815
Yeah.

01:16:46.856 --> 01:16:47.816
You too, Mac.

01:16:50.026 --> 01:16:51.403
May I have this dance?

01:16:51.444 --> 01:16:52.237
Yes.

01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:16.511
Presenting Lindsay
Morgan of California.

01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:17.637
Hi, Mom.

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.264
Oh, sweetheart.

01:17:19.305 --> 01:17:20.598
You're beautiful.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.516
Thanks, Mom.

01:17:21.558 --> 01:17:22.392
And you.

01:17:28.565 --> 01:17:29.315
Hello.

01:17:32.318 --> 01:17:33.820
[sighs]

01:17:39.492 --> 01:17:40.785
Excuse me, Sarah.

01:17:40.827 --> 01:17:42.454
May I have this dance?

01:17:42.495 --> 01:17:43.413
Yes.

01:17:43.455 --> 01:17:45.373
Thank you.

01:17:45.415 --> 01:17:46.708
- You came.
- Of course.

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:48.335
I couldn't miss my
brother and sister-in-law

01:17:48.376 --> 01:17:50.545
being announced to the world
as the Duke and Duchess

01:17:50.587 --> 01:17:51.338
of Glencrave.

01:17:56.343 --> 01:17:57.969
I'm sorry I got upset.

01:17:58.011 --> 01:17:59.637
I really am so happy for you.

01:17:59.679 --> 01:18:01.473
I'm sorry we didn't
talk to you first.

01:18:01.514 --> 01:18:04.017
Lindsay, I don't want to go back
to the way things have been.

01:18:04.059 --> 01:18:05.685
We've lost too much time.

01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:07.312
I know.

01:18:07.354 --> 01:18:08.813
I was too stubborn to realize
the biggest part of me

01:18:08.855 --> 01:18:11.107
was missing.

01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:12.484
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:18:12.525 --> 01:18:13.777
Me neither.

01:18:13.818 --> 01:18:15.653
I've missed you so much.

01:18:15.695 --> 01:18:17.822
So much.

01:18:17.864 --> 01:18:20.158
So I'm going to come
visit you all the time.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:25.872
And we will come home to
see you, and for the weather.

01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:28.333
Of course.

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:29.793
May I have this dance?

01:18:29.834 --> 01:18:30.627
Ah, yes.

01:18:33.963 --> 01:18:36.841
You are stunning.

01:18:36.883 --> 01:18:39.719
And you are very,
very handsome.

01:18:39.761 --> 01:18:41.388
Scots are hot.

01:18:41.429 --> 01:18:42.681
What can I say?

01:18:42.722 --> 01:18:44.057
They are.

01:18:44.099 --> 01:18:46.393
[laughs]

01:18:48.436 --> 01:18:50.105
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:18:50.146 --> 01:18:54.150
And thank you for coming to
the Glencrave Christmas ball.

01:18:54.192 --> 01:18:57.362
Tonight, I have a
special announcement

01:18:57.404 --> 01:19:02.534
to make on behalf of my brother,
the 11th Duke of Glencrave,

01:19:02.575 --> 01:19:05.495
who is sadly no longer with us.

01:19:05.537 --> 01:19:09.249
He was a wonderful man,
beloved by this community.

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:13.336
On this Christmas Eve, our
family turns a new page.

01:19:13.378 --> 01:19:17.382
So without further ado, I
officially present to you

01:19:17.424 --> 01:19:22.429
Brad Morgan and his wife
Sarah Morgan, the 12th Duke

01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:26.391
and Duchess of Glencrave.

01:19:26.433 --> 01:19:27.308
[cheering]

01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:28.143
Love it.

01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:32.105
Thank you.

01:19:32.147 --> 01:19:35.734
Thank you all so much.

01:19:35.775 --> 01:19:37.902
It's not too late.

01:19:37.944 --> 01:19:39.863
Thank you.

01:19:39.904 --> 01:19:40.655
Thank you all.

01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:45.744
Thank you.

01:19:45.785 --> 01:19:47.662
I have something for you.

01:19:47.704 --> 01:19:50.206
I want you to consider it
an early Christmas present.

01:19:58.048 --> 01:19:59.924
I'll wear it with pride.

01:19:59.966 --> 01:20:01.009
I know you will.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.778
Ho, ho, ho!

01:20:19.819 --> 01:20:21.529
Merry Christmas.

01:20:21.571 --> 01:20:23.406
Oh, Merry Christmas.

01:20:23.448 --> 01:20:26.201
Well, I say we're
the matching Morgans.

01:20:26.242 --> 01:20:28.536
It is a merry
Morgan Christmas.

01:20:28.578 --> 01:20:29.454
Hey.

01:20:29.496 --> 01:20:30.246
Darling.

01:20:37.754 --> 01:20:39.339
Merry Christmas.

01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:40.465
Oh.

01:20:40.507 --> 01:20:43.176
I couldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

01:20:43.218 --> 01:20:45.970
Merry Christmas, Lindsay.

01:20:46.012 --> 01:20:47.472
These are for Bonnie.

01:20:47.514 --> 01:20:48.306
Not for me?

01:20:48.348 --> 01:20:49.641
This is for you.

01:20:49.683 --> 01:20:51.142
It's Christmas pajamas.

01:20:51.184 --> 01:20:52.435
It's kind of my thing.

01:20:52.477 --> 01:20:53.311
Oh.

01:20:53.353 --> 01:20:54.270
Thanks.

01:20:54.312 --> 01:20:55.605
Sure.

01:20:55.647 --> 01:20:56.648
Right.

01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:58.149
I was hoping you'd come by.

01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:08.618
It's the Glencrave crest.

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.411
Yeah.

01:21:09.452 --> 01:21:10.286
This is beautiful.

01:21:10.328 --> 01:21:11.413
Thank you.

01:21:11.454 --> 01:21:12.288
May I?

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:13.123
Please.

01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:25.510
So you're leaving tomorrow?

01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:28.263
Yeah, first thing.

01:21:28.304 --> 01:21:31.766
This is the best Christmas
I've had in a long time.

01:21:31.808 --> 01:21:33.977
I'm glad.

01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:35.103
You're a special person.

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:49.743
Goodbye, Mac.

01:22:07.761 --> 01:22:09.220
The car is ready.

01:22:09.262 --> 01:22:11.639
I'll be driving you
to the airport myself.

01:22:11.681 --> 01:22:13.975
Thanks, Graham.

01:22:14.017 --> 01:22:14.768
In your own time.

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.367
What's all this?

01:22:30.408 --> 01:22:32.077
They came to see you off.

01:22:32.118 --> 01:22:33.495
You're a part of Glencrave now.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.167
Thank you, everyone.

01:22:39.209 --> 01:22:40.210
Thank you so much.

01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:45.840
Mom.

01:23:01.773 --> 01:23:04.317
I'm going to miss you so much.

01:23:04.359 --> 01:23:07.070
I love you the best.

01:23:07.112 --> 01:23:07.862
You know that.

01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:12.617
I love you more.

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:24.921
One more gift.

01:23:37.517 --> 01:23:38.309
Bye.

01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:03.877
Your key.

01:24:08.465 --> 01:24:10.508
Graham, turn the car around.

01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:11.843
You know what?

01:24:11.885 --> 01:24:13.595
If I can figure out how
to run my own practice,

01:24:13.636 --> 01:24:15.180
I can figure out how
to make this work.

01:24:15.221 --> 01:24:16.848
I mean, this is the
first place that's

01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:21.603
felt like home in a really long
time, and we're a team, right?

01:24:21.644 --> 01:24:22.479
Absolutely.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.357
Then let's do this-- together.

01:24:25.398 --> 01:24:28.318
And you, how do you feel
about dating a duchess?

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.197
It would be my honor,
Lindsay Morgan of Glencrave.

01:24:32.238 --> 01:24:34.407
Oh, that has a
nice ring to it.

01:24:38.787 --> 01:24:41.331
[laughter]

01:24:45.126 --> 01:24:46.836
Hello.

01:24:46.878 --> 01:24:49.964
Oh, she's here.

01:24:50.006 --> 01:24:51.800
Ainsley's first Christmas.

01:24:51.841 --> 01:24:52.926
Hi.

01:24:52.967 --> 01:24:55.428
And she looks so beautiful.

01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:57.972
You're going to have a great
life, aren't you, Ainsley?

01:24:58.014 --> 01:24:59.933
And you're going to forge
your own little path.

01:24:59.974 --> 01:25:01.351
Mom.

01:25:01.393 --> 01:25:03.353
And she'll be whatever
she wants, as long

01:25:03.395 --> 01:25:04.771
as her family's by her side.

01:25:04.813 --> 01:25:08.274
She's our wee
Christmas miracle baby.

01:25:08.316 --> 01:25:10.068
Why don't we take
a family photograph?

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:11.027
- Perfect.
- Right there.

01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:12.779
OK.

01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:14.072
You ready, honey?

01:25:14.114 --> 01:25:15.407
Ready?

01:25:15.448 --> 01:25:18.201
Now, let's have a
big Christmas smile.

01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:18.993
Merry Christmas.

01:25:19.035 --> 01:25:19.869
Merry Christmas.

01:25:19.911 --> 01:25:20.787
Merry Christmas.

01:25:24.749 --> 01:25:27.460
[scottish music]
