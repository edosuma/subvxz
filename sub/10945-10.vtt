00:00.062 --> 00:01.859
<i>Previously on heartland...</i>

00:01.870 --> 00:03.170
<i>I want you to look
at the horse I've just bought.</i>

00:03.238 --> 00:04.572
Zeus is not a liberty horse.

00:04.606 --> 00:07.241
I really think you're going to get
the results you're looking for.

00:07.309 --> 00:08.576
<i>The horse
only needs one master,</i>

00:08.610 --> 00:10.678
so I think Amy's better off
with Zeus on her own.

00:10.713 --> 00:12.179
I'm happy you
said what you said,

00:12.214 --> 00:16.116
because it made me realize
how much I care about you.

00:16.151 --> 00:17.885
You've been drinking again.

00:17.953 --> 00:19.854
You put the horses in danger.

00:19.921 --> 00:21.322
You're fired.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.622
I gotta go. Now?

00:22.657 --> 00:24.091
With the storm,
Amir's freaking out in his stall

00:24.159 --> 00:25.726
and they need me
to settle him down.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.661
Okay, fine. Go.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.396
Fine, I will.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.865
Zeus!

00:31.899 --> 00:33.867
Ungh! Oof!

00:39.841 --> 00:41.408
<i>Blunt force
trauma, heart rate...</i>

00:49.016 --> 00:51.851
The small intestine, yes.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.260
Hello!

01:00.327 --> 01:02.361
Jack.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.598
What?

01:05.665 --> 01:07.266
She's where? She's...

01:07.300 --> 01:08.768
Is she okay?

Hello. Excuse me?

01:29.155 --> 01:30.789
I'm looking for...
I'm looking for Amy Fleming.

01:30.856 --> 01:32.291
Has she been admitted here?

01:32.325 --> 01:33.558
Are you a relative
of miss Fleming?

01:33.592 --> 01:34.992
Yes, I'm her fiance.

01:35.027 --> 01:36.694
Can you tell me where she is,
please?

01:36.729 --> 01:39.564
She's been admitted to the icu.

01:39.632 --> 01:40.932
To the icu?

01:40.966 --> 01:42.434
What happened?
Is she all right?

01:42.468 --> 01:43.535
Have a seat.

01:43.569 --> 01:45.069
I just need to see her
if that's okay.

01:45.103 --> 01:48.873
A doctor will be with you
shortly.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.308
Okay.

01:59.151 --> 02:01.785
Ty?! How is she?

02:01.820 --> 02:04.855
- You tell me. What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

02:04.889 --> 02:06.090
What do you mean
you don't know?

02:06.158 --> 02:08.258
- You were with her, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't.

02:08.292 --> 02:09.693
I heard the noise
of the horses,

02:09.727 --> 02:12.195
but by the time I got to
the stable, Amy was down.

02:12.229 --> 02:13.664
Down? What do you mean down?

02:13.698 --> 02:16.232
Down, on the floor,
unconscious.

02:16.267 --> 02:17.868
I called 9-1-1.

02:17.902 --> 02:19.169
The horses were
let out of their stalls,

02:19.203 --> 02:22.172
almost trampling each other
to get away.

02:22.206 --> 02:23.873
There must have been
a horse fight.

02:23.907 --> 02:25.708
Amy and Zeus are covered
with bites and cuts.

02:25.742 --> 02:27.277
You think she got caught
in the middle of it?

02:27.311 --> 02:28.778
Maybe. I don't know.

02:28.812 --> 02:30.213
I have no idea why
she was even there.

02:30.247 --> 02:32.648
She was there because
you texted her to be there.

02:32.683 --> 02:35.318
Texted her? I didn't.

02:35.353 --> 02:36.819
Yeah, you did.

02:36.854 --> 02:38.054
She said you needed help
with Amir -

02:38.089 --> 02:40.289
getting him calmed down
after the storm.

02:40.323 --> 02:44.794
No, I swear, I didn't
ask for her help.

02:46.730 --> 02:47.730
What's going on?

02:47.798 --> 02:49.231
Everything's gonna be okay.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.333
Can you, uh,
can you watch Katie for me?

02:51.368 --> 02:52.334
Um, yeah.

02:52.369 --> 02:53.636
Okay. Good girl.

02:53.670 --> 02:56.571
Breath sounds are clear
and equal bilaterally.

02:56.606 --> 02:59.408
Patient has spontaneous
respirations.

02:59.442 --> 03:01.877
GCs is five.

03:01.911 --> 03:06.148
<i>I want an mri done on her head</i>
<i>and neck immediately.</i>

03:06.182 --> 03:08.117
Caleb, I need you go
to the house

03:08.184 --> 03:10.419
and watch Katie and Georgie
for me.

03:10.487 --> 03:11.753
Yeah, okay.

03:14.423 --> 03:17.626
Uh, Amy's been hurt and-and
it sounds like it's serious.

03:17.660 --> 03:18.894
Are you kidding me?

03:18.928 --> 03:21.462
No. She's at the hospital and I
gotta go to her, so can you...

03:21.531 --> 03:22.731
Yeah, of course.

03:22.798 --> 03:24.566
<i>Okay.</i>

03:24.634 --> 03:26.034
Call me. I will.

03:26.068 --> 03:29.103
Excuse me, I'm, uh,
I'm Amy Fleming's father.

03:29.171 --> 03:30.471
Where is she?

03:30.506 --> 03:32.373
I'm afraid you'll have to wait
for the doctor, sir.

03:32.441 --> 03:35.910
Tim, we don't know
what happened yet.

03:35.944 --> 03:37.145
Well, I need to know
what happened.

03:37.212 --> 03:38.846
I need to see her.
Where is she?

03:38.914 --> 03:41.049
Oh, okay, just listen. Hi.

03:41.083 --> 03:44.885
I wonder if you have any
information, just anything at all?

03:44.953 --> 03:47.955
I'm sorry, her status is
unclear at this time.

03:48.023 --> 03:49.790
Unclear? Why?

03:49.858 --> 03:51.525
What happened to my daughter?

03:51.593 --> 03:52.793
I need to speak with someone
who knows something,

03:52.861 --> 03:54.394
<i>and I need to speak</i>
<i>to them now.</i>

03:54.462 --> 03:57.598
Excuse me, only
family members are allowed.

03:57.666 --> 04:00.601
If you're not a family member,
I have to ask you to leave.

04:00.669 --> 04:02.769
<i>Ridiculous!</i>

04:02.836 --> 04:05.872
Call me with any news.
Any at all.

04:08.443 --> 04:12.479
Dr. Berman, the
family's waiting.

04:14.415 --> 04:16.450
You okay? Hey. Yeah.

04:17.851 --> 04:19.151
Have you heard anything?

04:19.185 --> 04:20.920
No, nothing.

04:24.091 --> 04:25.725
You're Amy's family?

04:25.759 --> 04:27.060
Yes.

04:27.127 --> 04:30.663
Hello. Dr. Berman,
I'm the head of neurology here.

04:30.698 --> 04:34.266
All right then, Amy has suffered
a blow to the back of her head.

04:34.334 --> 04:38.104
Given the circumstances, it's probable
she's been kicked by a horse.

04:38.138 --> 04:39.805
She still hasn't
regained consciousness,

04:39.839 --> 04:42.208
which is quite normal
for a head injury of this type.

04:42.242 --> 04:44.910
When do you expect
she'll regain consciousness?

04:44.944 --> 04:46.878
<i>Well, that's
a bit unpredictable.</i>

04:46.913 --> 04:49.715
<i>Her vital signs are strong,</i> and
as far as motor response goes,

04:49.749 --> 04:53.251
she can move her arms and legs,
so there's no damage there.

04:53.285 --> 04:55.420
<i>But her eye response is slow.</i>

04:56.355 --> 04:57.723
Please, have a seat.

04:58.758 --> 05:02.160
Well, the blow was near
the occipital lobe of the brain,

05:02.194 --> 05:04.362
which contains
the vision center.

05:04.396 --> 05:07.099
At the present time,
Amy is not responding to light.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.200
What does that mean?

05:11.303 --> 05:13.605
I'm not the kind of doctor
who sugar-coats things.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.773
You need to know that
there is a possibility here

05:15.807 --> 05:18.876
of post-traumatic
cortical blindness.

05:18.910 --> 05:21.513
Now, this could very well
be a temporary state,

05:21.547 --> 05:23.414
but you must
also understand that

05:23.449 --> 05:27.051
if her sight does not return to
normal <i>in three to four days,</i>

05:27.085 --> 05:28.686
that there is
a sharply increased chance

05:28.720 --> 05:30.888
that there will be
lasting damage.

05:30.922 --> 05:33.223
<i>We will continue</i>
<i>to monitor Amy,</i>

05:33.258 --> 05:34.992
but we won't know much more
before morning.

05:35.027 --> 05:38.562
So my advice is to go home,
try to get some sleep.

05:38.596 --> 05:40.597
<i>I know it's hard.</i>

05:40.632 --> 05:41.931
You'll be called
when she regains consciousness

05:41.999 --> 05:45.135
or if there is
any sudden change.

05:45.170 --> 05:48.238
Thank you. Thank you.

05:51.276 --> 05:55.179
Well, I'm not leaving.
I've gotta go see her.

06:00.951 --> 06:05.254
Amy, come on,
you gotta wake up.

06:07.024 --> 06:09.325
You're going to be okay.

06:15.399 --> 06:19.602
Amy! Come on,
you gotta wake up, okay?

06:21.771 --> 06:23.806
I know you can do it.

06:27.811 --> 06:29.645
Come on.

06:32.448 --> 06:34.549
You can do this, Amy.

06:34.617 --> 06:36.318
Come on.

06:55.904 --> 06:58.240

08:08.875 --> 08:10.509
Any change?

08:12.478 --> 08:14.546
They said she was kicked
in the back of the head.

08:16.349 --> 08:19.751
I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

08:20.954 --> 08:25.024
I feel, in so many ways,
that it's my fault.

08:29.295 --> 08:30.562
I'm still trying
to get to the bottom

08:30.596 --> 08:32.864
of this whole bizarre situation.

08:32.898 --> 08:36.568
My security team is trying to
find out who is responsible.

08:37.503 --> 08:41.573
I have my suspicions,
but nothing I can prove.

08:44.509 --> 08:47.312
Is there anything I can do?

08:55.687 --> 08:57.755
I'm sorry.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.438
<i>You should never
have encouraged Amy</i>

09:14.506 --> 09:15.539
to take that job.

09:15.607 --> 09:16.874
For you,
it was all about the money.

09:16.908 --> 09:17.875
Oh, that is not true.

09:17.909 --> 09:19.109
Amy wanted to go on her own.

09:19.143 --> 09:20.310
I couldn't have stopped her
if I tried.

09:20.345 --> 09:21.678
Yeah, but you didn't try.

09:21.746 --> 09:23.113
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>you encouraged her.</i>

09:23.181 --> 09:25.983
Please, grandpa, dad,
let's not do this.

09:26.050 --> 09:27.417
- What about Ty, hmm?
- What about Ty?

09:27.451 --> 09:29.019
He never should've let her go
to the stables alone.

09:29.087 --> 09:30.087
He should have gone with her.

09:30.154 --> 09:31.889
Ty isn't Amy's protector.

09:31.923 --> 09:34.624
With a storm coming,
he should have gone.

09:34.658 --> 09:39.362
Ty didn't want her to
go, but Amy said she had to.

09:39.430 --> 09:42.231
I needed Ty to help me
with Phoenix.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.934
It's all my fault.

10:02.085 --> 10:04.453
It's not your fault.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.557
George, it isn't.

10:10.627 --> 10:15.063
You didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.937
I was mad at Amy.

10:22.972 --> 10:27.708
I made her feel bad that she
wouldn't help with Phoenix.

10:28.978 --> 10:33.048
What if I don't get a chance
to say I'm sorry?

10:34.817 --> 10:36.418
Come here.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.488
No, no, shhh.

10:42.925 --> 10:44.992
Hi. I'm Jenna.

10:45.060 --> 10:46.527
Hi.

10:46.595 --> 10:47.628
Just a heads up.

10:47.663 --> 10:51.499
Dr. Berman wants to do
more tests.

10:51.533 --> 10:52.567
<i>I'm sorry, but you're gonna</i>
<i>have to pop out</i>

10:52.601 --> 10:53.835
<i>when he gets here.</i>

10:53.869 --> 10:58.205
<i>Maybe go to the cafeteria,</i>
<i>or even better,</i>

10:58.239 --> 11:01.241
<i>go outside and get some air.</i>

11:03.044 --> 11:05.412
So you're Amy's fiance?

11:07.648 --> 11:09.383
Yes, I am.

11:10.518 --> 11:13.587
Tests shouldn't take very long.

11:26.934 --> 11:28.767
I'll be right back.

11:29.703 --> 11:31.770
I love you.

11:44.751 --> 11:46.719
Amy. Amy, hey!

11:47.654 --> 11:50.455
Ty?! Ty?! Ty?!

11:51.014 --> 11:53.215
How can you just stand there
telling me

11:53.249 --> 11:55.518
that my daughter
might possibly be blind?

11:55.552 --> 11:57.720
I understand
your distress, Mr. Fleming.

11:57.754 --> 12:01.456
We're doing everything we can to
keep Amy calm and comfortable.

12:01.491 --> 12:04.226
<i>As far as her sight returning,</i>
<i>only time will tell.</i>

12:04.293 --> 12:05.560
<i>This is a brain injury.</i>

12:05.594 --> 12:08.663
<i>We need to know.
We deserve to know.</i>

12:08.731 --> 12:11.233
You've seen these cases before,
what are the odds?

12:11.267 --> 12:13.601
There are no
odds in these situations.

12:13.669 --> 12:15.404
But there has to be
some kind of treatment,

12:15.438 --> 12:17.472
something we can do.

12:20.142 --> 12:21.576
You're gonna be fine, Amy.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.177
I'm not fine, Ty, I'm not fine.

12:23.245 --> 12:27.081
It's okay.
You will be, all right?

12:27.149 --> 12:28.816
<i>Take a breath.</i>

12:29.785 --> 12:32.854
That's good. That's good, Amy.

12:32.922 --> 12:34.422
What happened to me?

12:34.489 --> 12:38.359
You took a hit...
On the back of your head.

12:38.427 --> 12:40.294
From what?

12:40.362 --> 12:42.663
Y-you don't remember?

12:42.697 --> 12:44.098
No.

12:45.967 --> 12:51.838
Amy, the injury affected
the part of your brain

12:51.906 --> 12:54.741
where the vision centre is.

12:54.809 --> 12:57.678
The doctor said this is usually
a temporary state.

12:57.745 --> 12:59.145
Usually?

13:00.848 --> 13:04.184
I'm sorry, Ty, but now that
Amy's a little calmer,

13:04.251 --> 13:05.018
I would like to speak with her.

13:05.086 --> 13:06.453
Yeah, of course.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.787
Hello, young lady.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.556
Hi.

13:09.590 --> 13:12.525
I don't wanna upset you, but do
you think you might be ready now

13:12.593 --> 13:15.095
to answer a few questions
for me?

13:15.162 --> 13:17.363
Okay, good.

13:17.398 --> 13:19.732
Do you remember your name?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.634
Amy Fleming.

13:21.702 --> 13:23.736
Well, that was easy.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.940
Can you tell me what day it is?

13:27.975 --> 13:28.975
I don't know.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.077
Okay, no problem.

13:31.144 --> 13:36.248
Who's this here, this handsome
young man who's holding your hand?

13:36.316 --> 13:39.986
It's Ty borden, my boy-,
my fiance.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.421
Fiance? Hmm. Congratulations.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.392
Do you know why you're here?

13:48.361 --> 13:51.696
Ty said I was in an accident.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.734
My head...

13:55.768 --> 13:58.870
Okay, do you remember
what happened?

13:58.904 --> 14:00.138
No.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.774
Do you remember going
into the stables, Amy?

14:04.343 --> 14:06.344
You have no recollection
at all?

14:06.378 --> 14:07.779
What's the last
thing you remember?

14:07.813 --> 14:11.382
Mr. borden. Ty, please.

14:14.153 --> 14:15.553
It's all right.

14:15.587 --> 14:18.623
Amy, I want you to understand
something, okay?

14:18.657 --> 14:20.224
The way that you're feeling -

14:20.259 --> 14:22.860
<i>the memory loss,</i>
<i>the lack of vision -</i>

14:22.894 --> 14:27.064
<i>is all absolutely normal</i>
<i>after this type of head injury.</i>

14:27.098 --> 14:28.932
I'll come back in a while
and check up on you, okay?

14:28.967 --> 14:32.036
In the meantime,
you get some sleep.

14:34.806 --> 14:36.874
Thank you, doctor,

14:40.945 --> 14:42.345
<i>hey, Ty.</i>

14:44.415 --> 14:47.784
Lou and Tim,
they went home to the girls.

14:47.818 --> 14:49.186
Grandpa.

14:50.321 --> 14:54.957
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

14:58.496 --> 15:00.297
Ty?

15:00.331 --> 15:01.565
Yeah?

15:01.599 --> 15:04.233
You should go home
and get some rest, I think.

15:04.267 --> 15:05.301
No.

15:07.705 --> 15:09.438
No, I don't need that.

15:09.506 --> 15:11.708
<i>Yeah, you do.</i>

15:11.775 --> 15:18.881
I'll stay here with Amy and I'll
call you if there's any change.

15:18.882 --> 15:20.449
I'm all right.

15:21.984 --> 15:28.990
Ty, you're no good to her if you're
gonna fall apart from exhaustion.

15:30.827 --> 15:32.194
All right.

15:38.334 --> 15:40.035
All right.

15:42.772 --> 15:44.472
Love you.

16:07.529 --> 16:10.464
You're gonna be fine, honey.

16:11.399 --> 16:13.033
You're gonna be fine.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.409
Hmm.

17:14.894 --> 17:17.561
Uh...
Uh, just hold on a second.

17:20.098 --> 17:22.166
Come in.

17:23.769 --> 17:25.537
Hey, Ty. Hey.

17:25.570 --> 17:27.638
You holdin' up all right? Yeah.

17:27.673 --> 17:30.408
We've got some supplies
for you.

17:31.944 --> 17:33.478
How's she doing?

17:33.512 --> 17:35.313
She's, um, she's conscious.

17:36.248 --> 17:38.115
Good. That's really good.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.518
<i>No, it's not...</i>

17:41.487 --> 17:44.689
She's um... She's b-

17:45.491 --> 17:48.092
she's blind.

17:49.862 --> 17:53.630
I know a tonne of guys, they got
tossed off of bulls onto their heads

17:53.665 --> 17:56.667
and they went blind too,
but it's just temporary,

17:56.701 --> 17:59.070
it'll come back. You'll
see, it always comes back.

17:59.104 --> 18:00.304
Yeah.

18:00.339 --> 18:01.939
Is there
anything that we can do?

18:02.007 --> 18:04.575
Anything you want, man,
you name it.

18:04.609 --> 18:06.377
Uh, no, thanks.

18:09.481 --> 18:12.249
I'm just gonna go back
to the hospital.

18:12.283 --> 18:15.686
If you could give Scott a call,
just let him know?

18:15.754 --> 18:16.887
Hey, you got it.

18:16.954 --> 18:18.255
Go. We'll lock up here.

18:18.289 --> 18:19.656
Thanks.

18:26.663 --> 18:31.001
<i>Dr. Martin, dial 256.
Dr. Martin, dial 256.</i>

18:32.904 --> 18:34.304
Amy.

18:37.541 --> 18:39.876
<i>Excuse me?
Can I help you?</i>

18:39.943 --> 18:42.978
Uh, yeah, Amy Fleming,
where is she?

18:43.046 --> 18:45.314
Uh, miss Fleming?

18:45.382 --> 18:49.084
She's been moved
to a private room.

18:49.152 --> 18:50.553
Oh, God.

18:50.621 --> 18:53.423
I'm sorry,
someone should've told you.

18:53.490 --> 18:55.291
No, it's okay.

18:55.358 --> 18:57.059
Come with me. Okay.

19:03.033 --> 19:04.566
Hey. Hey.

19:05.568 --> 19:08.971
Well, she's been sleeping
on and off.

19:09.005 --> 19:10.539
They moved here.

19:10.606 --> 19:14.342
Well, apparently that
prince guy, Ahmed,

19:14.410 --> 19:17.345
he's responsible
for the private room.

19:19.014 --> 19:21.115
Well, I should go.

19:22.051 --> 19:23.184
Lou is upset.

19:23.252 --> 19:25.887
<i>Looks like Peter</i>
<i>can't make it back.</i>

19:25.922 --> 19:27.655
Call me. Okay.

19:33.595 --> 19:35.796
Hey, Amy.

19:35.831 --> 19:36.897
Hey.

19:36.966 --> 19:38.032
- Grandpa?
- Hey. No, it's me.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.100
- Ty, where are you?
- It's me.

19:39.168 --> 19:40.501
I'm right here, I'm right here.

19:40.535 --> 19:42.437
It's okay. It's okay.

19:43.905 --> 19:45.238
Ty, my head.

19:45.306 --> 19:47.274
It's all right. It hurts.

19:47.308 --> 19:50.377
Don't move. Just relax, okay?

19:51.513 --> 19:54.381
Ty, can you tell me
what happened?

19:54.449 --> 19:56.784
Do you remember going
to hill hurst the other night?

19:56.818 --> 19:58.652
No.

19:58.687 --> 20:00.520
There was a storm,
it was pretty bad -

20:00.588 --> 20:02.089
lots of thunder and lightning.

20:02.123 --> 20:04.124
<i>I don't remember.</i>

20:05.059 --> 20:07.127
It's okay. It's okay.

20:10.198 --> 20:12.199
What do you remember?

20:12.233 --> 20:16.970
I think...
I think there was a horse,

20:17.004 --> 20:19.071
but not at heartland.

20:20.107 --> 20:21.240
That's right.

20:22.776 --> 20:24.644
That's right, Amy.

20:24.678 --> 20:27.680
You had a new job
at hill hurst.

20:27.715 --> 20:31.117
You were working
with a new horse, Zeus.

20:32.285 --> 20:33.585
Zeus.

20:33.653 --> 20:37.556
And, the night before last,
you went back to help out

20:37.590 --> 20:39.591
and you had an accident.

20:39.626 --> 20:41.960
<i>They found you</i>
<i>in the main stables.</i>

20:41.995 --> 20:43.062
<i>The doctors think</i>
<i>that you were kicked</i>

20:43.130 --> 20:45.531
<i>in the back of the head
by one of the horses.</i>

20:49.369 --> 20:50.769
Ty! Hey, hey.

20:51.804 --> 20:53.271
Hey, I'm right here,
I'm right here.

20:53.305 --> 20:56.341
I'm so scared.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.777
I've never been so scared
in my life.

20:58.811 --> 21:00.512
Shh... it's okay.

21:00.547 --> 21:03.682
Hey, we're going to be okay.

21:03.716 --> 21:05.651
You're going to get better,
okay?

21:07.886 --> 21:09.854
It's okay.

21:09.922 --> 21:12.190
Got to be something
that doctor can do.

21:12.224 --> 21:13.658
Jack?

21:13.692 --> 21:16.494
How can it be good enough
to just sit and wait?

21:16.529 --> 21:17.995
Time will tell, he says.

21:18.064 --> 21:19.030
Come on, what is that?

21:19.098 --> 21:20.265
That is ridiculous.

21:20.299 --> 21:22.233
We need a second opinion,
we need it pronto.

21:22.301 --> 21:23.668
<i>Tim, calm down.</i>

21:23.702 --> 21:25.803
<i>I am calm, we just
have to do something.</i>

21:28.774 --> 21:30.174
How is she?

21:33.879 --> 21:36.180
Uh, she's sleeping.

21:36.214 --> 21:41.085
Look, Dr. Berman is one of
the top neurologists in alberta.

21:41.152 --> 21:43.687
<i>I know it's tough</i>
<i>to just wait and see,</i>

21:43.754 --> 21:45.089
<i>but she's in good hands</i>

21:45.156 --> 21:47.023
<i>and it's the only thing</i>
<i>we can do.</i>

21:47.092 --> 21:49.359
<i>No, it isn't.
She can't see.</i>

21:49.427 --> 21:50.627
<i>We need a better doctor.</i>

21:50.661 --> 21:52.762
<i>We need to move her</i>
<i>to a better hospital.</i>

21:52.830 --> 21:55.265
No, we need to bring her home.

21:56.533 --> 22:00.570
What, and do without the only
medical help we're getting?

22:01.772 --> 22:03.673
Look, I know Amy.

22:03.741 --> 22:06.743
She's completely disoriented
in that hospital.

22:06.811 --> 22:08.411
She's gonna get better
a lot quicker if she's here,

22:08.479 --> 22:10.647
in a place
that she's familiar with.

22:10.715 --> 22:12.448
We need to bring her home.

22:12.516 --> 22:14.484
I'm sorry, Ty, but I
think that she's better off

22:14.518 --> 22:15.485
in the hospital for now.

22:15.519 --> 22:17.587
I have to agree.

22:18.688 --> 22:22.258
Well, I don't. I don't agree.

22:24.060 --> 22:26.462
I have to get
some of her things.

22:59.061 --> 23:02.630
Ty?! Ty! Where are you?!

23:02.665 --> 23:03.731
It-it's all right, Amy.

23:03.766 --> 23:05.366
Ty? It's all right.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.001
Where is he? Just calm down.

23:07.069 --> 23:09.671
Just breathe. Breathe.

23:09.705 --> 23:11.873
- Just breathe.
- Oh no!

23:11.907 --> 23:13.775
You're okay.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.710
<i>You're safe.</i>

23:15.744 --> 23:18.112
<i>It's okay.</i>

23:31.193 --> 23:32.793
Hello?

23:32.827 --> 23:33.760
<i>Hello, this nurse Jenna
calling from the bow hospital.</i>

23:33.795 --> 23:35.028
<i>Is this Ty borden?</i>

23:35.063 --> 23:36.362
Yes.

23:36.397 --> 23:38.065
<i>Amy Fleming has
been asking for you.</i>

23:38.099 --> 23:39.199
Is she okay?

23:39.233 --> 23:41.001
<i>She's quite agitated and-</i>

23:41.035 --> 23:42.302
yeah, okay, I'm coming now.

23:42.336 --> 23:43.970
Yeah, I'm leaving right now.

23:47.308 --> 23:48.274
Hi.

23:48.309 --> 23:49.976
I gave her a mild sedative.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.344
Buzz me if you need me.

23:51.378 --> 23:52.679
Okay.

23:54.114 --> 23:56.782
Amy. Hey, hey, hey.

23:56.817 --> 23:57.917
Ty!

23:57.951 --> 23:59.285
I'm right here. Right here.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.321
Are you okay?

24:01.355 --> 24:03.323
I'm so scared.

24:03.357 --> 24:06.359
I don't know where I am.
I hate this.

24:06.393 --> 24:07.760
I'm right here.

24:09.662 --> 24:12.297
I just want to go home.

24:12.332 --> 24:15.367
Please take me home. Please.

24:23.143 --> 24:25.076
<i>So you've done some research.</i>

24:25.111 --> 24:27.078
What did you find? Thank you.

24:27.113 --> 24:30.382
I've read a tonne of articles that
say stress can be a key factor,

24:30.450 --> 24:31.683
and the more stress
that Amy is under,

24:31.751 --> 24:33.619
the less likely it is
that her vision will improve.

24:33.686 --> 24:36.020
Stress can be a factor,
yes, that's true.

24:36.088 --> 24:37.789
Well, she is stressed here.
Completely stressed.

24:37.857 --> 24:39.224
She had a panic attack
last night.

24:39.292 --> 24:43.261
That is completely understandable
given the circumstances, Ty.

24:43.295 --> 24:46.064
Well, I've also read that blindness
can be purely psychological,

24:46.098 --> 24:48.432
caused by a traumatic event.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.835
There was trauma. Blunt trauma.

24:50.903 --> 24:54.239
This is not psychological,
this is physical.

24:54.306 --> 24:56.808
I'm sorry, Ty, but I've got very
little patience for websites

24:56.876 --> 24:57.941
and self-diagnosis.

24:58.009 --> 25:00.043
Okay, look. Wait.

25:02.414 --> 25:04.482
If there are medical reasons
that are keeping her here

25:04.516 --> 25:11.989
that I don't know about, I respect
that, I do, but if there aren't,

25:12.056 --> 25:13.991
what's the difference
between her lying here

25:14.058 --> 25:15.492
and her lying in her own bed?

25:15.559 --> 25:17.227
She can be monitored here.

25:17.295 --> 25:19.162
She has twenty-four hour care
here.

25:19.229 --> 25:20.497
I can monitor her.

25:20.531 --> 25:22.399
I can watch her,
twenty-four seven.

25:22.433 --> 25:25.067
And we have a family doctor
five minutes away.

25:25.135 --> 25:31.140
Please, she'll get
better faster, at home.

25:31.208 --> 25:33.242
I know her.

25:57.434 --> 25:58.834
We're home.

26:07.970 --> 26:11.138
<i>Dr. Berman said</i>
<i>to keep the room dark.</i>

26:11.172 --> 26:13.240
Not that it matters.

26:14.710 --> 26:18.980
Hey, come on, Amy,
it's gonna change.

26:19.014 --> 26:21.448
Now that you're home, it will.

26:24.652 --> 26:25.986
Here.

26:27.288 --> 26:29.256
I got you some orange juice.

26:34.162 --> 26:35.129
- Oh!
- I got it, I got it.

26:35.163 --> 26:36.563
Damn.

26:36.597 --> 26:38.832
It's okay. It's okay.

26:38.866 --> 26:41.134
Okay, you just need to relax.

26:41.168 --> 26:43.236
Relax, okay? Lay back.

26:44.271 --> 26:46.006
Get some rest.

26:50.144 --> 26:53.146
You're gonna get better,
all right?

26:53.180 --> 26:56.115
You're gonna see again.

26:56.150 --> 26:58.817
And what if I don't?

26:58.885 --> 27:00.953
What if I can't see, Ty?

27:01.888 --> 27:03.089
What if I can't see you
ever again?!

27:03.123 --> 27:04.957
Shh, shh. Shh.

27:05.926 --> 27:07.326
Shhh...

27:09.396 --> 27:11.797
You will.

27:14.167 --> 27:16.234
You will.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.075
Bad idea.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.276
Who gave you permission
to bring her home?

27:24.310 --> 27:26.579
Dr. Berman did.
It's the best thing for Amy.

27:26.613 --> 27:28.146
Well, you and the doctor
are both wrong.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.614
This is a family decision.

27:29.682 --> 27:30.615
I am family.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.085
We know that, Ty, we do, but
dad's not entirely wrong.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.187
I wish you had
talked to us first.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.892
<i>I'm sorry to barge in.</i>

27:40.960 --> 27:42.794
I just came from the hospital.

27:42.828 --> 27:46.998
They told me about...
Her sight,

27:47.066 --> 27:48.866
and Amy is home.

27:48.934 --> 27:49.934
I am surprised.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.836
So are we.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.405
<i>But that's good.</i>

27:54.473 --> 27:56.574
Does that mean there is change
for the better?

27:56.642 --> 27:58.042
No. No change.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.177
<i>All right.</i>

28:00.245 --> 28:02.179
I want to make you an offer.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.948
I have a jet.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.518
Understand that
it's at your disposal.

28:07.586 --> 28:09.520
<i>I can get Amy</i>
<i>to the best specialist</i>

28:09.588 --> 28:12.656
<i>in the country, in the
world if need be.</i>

28:12.690 --> 28:14.658
Thank you, that is so generous.

28:14.726 --> 28:15.659
Yeah, we should do it.

28:15.727 --> 28:17.328
Just wait a second.

28:17.395 --> 28:20.764
Ahmed, that's a very
generous offer, thank you,

28:20.798 --> 28:23.566
but ultimately
this is Amy's decision.

28:26.971 --> 28:29.039
Just let me know.

28:38.015 --> 28:39.982
I don't want to. I
don't want to go anywhere.

28:40.050 --> 28:42.818
No,
Lou, I don't want to leave, okay?

28:42.853 --> 28:45.021
This is the only place that
feels certain to me right now.

28:45.055 --> 28:46.289
Are you sure?

28:46.323 --> 28:47.923
Amy, it could change everything,
it could-

28:47.958 --> 28:50.793
no, I don't want
to talk about it.

28:50.861 --> 28:52.728
We just want
what's best for you,

28:52.763 --> 28:56.265
and I would never forgive
<i>myself if you-<i>Amy: Don't.</i></i>

28:56.299 --> 29:02.705
It feels good to be home
right now, to be my own bed.

29:02.739 --> 29:05.141
At least I know where I am.

29:06.609 --> 29:10.546
Okay. I'll call Ahmed and tell
him we appreciate his offer,

29:10.580 --> 29:13.715
but we're not going to go
with it.

29:21.591 --> 29:25.359
Hey, I've been
looking all over for you.

29:26.295 --> 29:29.363
Amy's home.
Did you hear anything?

29:29.398 --> 29:31.132
No, nothing.

29:32.068 --> 29:33.835
What's the matter?

29:33.869 --> 29:35.403
It's like you've been hiding
from me.

29:38.140 --> 29:41.742
I just don't want
to get used to this.

29:41.776 --> 29:43.578
Used to what?

29:43.612 --> 29:49.617
Us. It's been feeling too good, too
like it used to - the old days.

29:49.651 --> 29:51.652
I just, I can't go there

29:51.687 --> 29:52.953
because it's probably
going to go away again

29:52.987 --> 29:56.056
and I know I can't handle that.

29:57.759 --> 30:00.027
I'm not going anywhere.

30:01.562 --> 30:04.297
It feels right for me too.

30:05.433 --> 30:07.467
There's a reason
that I came back

30:07.501 --> 30:11.671
and it wasn't to check
on my mother's house.

30:11.706 --> 30:13.773
It was to see you.

30:20.448 --> 30:22.482
Uh...

30:25.786 --> 30:28.688
Hey. So? You call him? Ahmed?

30:28.756 --> 30:30.056
Yeah, I called him.

30:30.090 --> 30:32.825
Good boy. Okay, so we're on.

30:32.860 --> 30:34.460
No, we're not.

30:35.395 --> 30:37.563
What do you mean?

30:37.631 --> 30:39.065
I turned him down.

30:39.133 --> 30:40.967
Are you out of your mind?

30:41.001 --> 30:42.668
Do you realize that
he's the difference

30:42.702 --> 30:44.771
between Amy being blind
and Amy being able to see?

30:44.838 --> 30:46.472
Tim, it's not that simple.

30:46.539 --> 30:48.073
Besides, it's Amy's decision.

30:48.141 --> 30:49.808
No, Amy can't make a decision.

30:49.876 --> 30:52.378
Then I made the decision, okay?
I'm her fiance.

30:52.445 --> 30:54.212
I'm not some stable boy
you can push around.

30:54.247 --> 30:56.348
- I don't care who the hell you think you are.
- Don't touch me!

30:56.416 --> 30:58.751
You guys! Dad! Stop!

30:58.818 --> 31:01.119
You had no right
to make that decision.

31:01.187 --> 31:02.354
Well, I made it!

31:02.422 --> 31:03.621
Give me his number,
I'm gonna call the guy.

31:03.656 --> 31:04.555
Okay, would you
both just simmer down?

31:04.623 --> 31:05.957
Amy is trying to sleep.

31:05.992 --> 31:07.525
Amy is gonna do
far better here recovering

31:07.593 --> 31:09.560
than she is with the stress
of getting on some plane.

31:09.628 --> 31:10.829
Are you an expert now?

31:10.897 --> 31:12.664
I'm not saying I'm
an expert on this.

31:12.731 --> 31:14.499
Well, that's good,
because you're not.

31:15.835 --> 31:16.601
<i>Understand
the situation, Tim.</i>

31:17.736 --> 31:18.736
You don't know
what you're doing!

31:18.771 --> 31:19.771
What do you know?

31:21.707 --> 31:22.840
"Research."

31:22.908 --> 31:24.375
Would you just both stop?!
Amy is sleeping!

31:24.443 --> 31:25.510
What is going on?

31:25.577 --> 31:26.911
He... he just...

31:28.046 --> 31:29.414
<i>Ruined any chance we have</i>

31:29.448 --> 31:31.982
of getting the best medical
attention at our disposal.

31:36.454 --> 31:38.856
It wasn't just Ty.
Amy didn't want to go.

31:38.924 --> 31:41.991
Amy can't make a decision
for herself!

31:42.059 --> 31:44.093
Ty?

31:46.263 --> 31:48.965
Ty, I think
I remember something.

31:56.533 --> 31:58.200
<i>There was this</i>
<i>massive horse fight</i>

31:58.235 --> 31:59.802
and all the stall doors
were open.

31:59.836 --> 32:03.039
But, Ty, it wasn't just a dream,
this is what actually happened.

32:03.073 --> 32:04.941
There was something else.

32:04.975 --> 32:06.375
There was someone there.

32:06.410 --> 32:09.345
In my dream,
I saw someone running.

32:09.379 --> 32:11.013
I couldn't see their face.

32:13.616 --> 32:16.618
Okay. Amy, you should lie down.

32:16.653 --> 32:20.989
Ty, I am so tired
of lying here.

32:23.760 --> 32:26.061
Feeling any better, Amy?

32:26.095 --> 32:28.163
Hey, Georgie.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.167
Yeah, a little better.

32:32.201 --> 32:36.271
Well, do you want to go out
to the barn to see Phoenix?

32:37.906 --> 32:41.076
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to say that.

32:41.110 --> 32:42.510
It's okay.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.579
I don't think she's feeling
up to it right now, Georgie.

32:44.613 --> 32:48.683
Actually, I would love
to go out to the barn.

32:53.088 --> 32:55.155
Here we are, Amy.

32:58.961 --> 33:00.327
This is stupid.
I can't do this.

33:00.362 --> 33:03.630
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay, we can go back.

33:03.664 --> 33:05.065
Do you want to go back?

33:06.834 --> 33:09.036
No. No?

33:09.104 --> 33:11.438
It's okay.

33:11.473 --> 33:13.540
All right, right here.

33:18.779 --> 33:20.446
Here's Phoenix.

33:20.481 --> 33:21.447
He's right here, Amy.

33:21.482 --> 33:23.316
Hey, buddy. Look, it's Amy.

33:27.221 --> 33:29.656
Hey, hey, hey, easy. You okay?

33:33.227 --> 33:36.295
Yeah, I want to go to spartan.

33:37.331 --> 33:39.965
Okay, he's right up here.

33:44.638 --> 33:47.873
Hi.

33:47.908 --> 33:49.808
Hey, spartan.

33:49.843 --> 33:51.610
You're such a good boy.

33:57.450 --> 33:59.652
You got better for me,

34:01.054 --> 34:04.623
I'm gonna get better for you,
okay?

34:04.691 --> 34:06.725
I promise.

34:18.571 --> 34:21.540
Adrian. It was Adrian
in the stable that night.

34:21.607 --> 34:24.976
I saw him running away.

34:25.010 --> 34:29.513
I suspected it was Adrian all
along, but I had no proof.

34:29.581 --> 34:32.315
The security cameras couldn't
pick up anything in the darkness,

34:32.350 --> 34:35.252
so we had no recorded
image available.

34:36.254 --> 34:37.889
I have the local police
tracking him down

34:37.956 --> 34:40.991
and then we'll get
some answers.

34:41.926 --> 34:45.629
So it was Adrian that
texted you, not Ahmed.

34:45.663 --> 34:48.732
I had completely forgotten
until now.

34:50.135 --> 34:52.168
He did it deliberately, then?

34:53.138 --> 34:54.472
He set me up?

34:55.773 --> 34:57.574
Why would he do that?

34:58.610 --> 35:01.011
He had begun to drink again.

35:01.079 --> 35:07.217
That's why I fired him, and this
was his revenge on me, I suppose.

35:07.251 --> 35:11.321
I am so sorry
that he took it out on you.

35:19.530 --> 35:22.665
Feeling better? Less pain?

35:22.699 --> 35:24.434
Yeah.

35:26.737 --> 35:28.804
Whatcha thinkin' about?

35:30.140 --> 35:31.874
Just that...

35:35.478 --> 35:41.517
I still can't see and I
probably won't ever again.

35:41.551 --> 35:45.354
Amy, you will.

35:45.388 --> 35:47.789
I know it, you will.

35:47.823 --> 35:55.030
You know I've had a lot of time
to think, probably too much.

35:55.064 --> 36:00.869
And there is a good chance
that I won't get better,

36:00.903 --> 36:02.003
and that I'll be blind.

36:02.071 --> 36:03.872
No. Ty, please listen.

36:05.374 --> 36:09.878
Look, you didn't sign up
for this,

36:11.013 --> 36:12.647
and you don't need
to follow through.

36:12.682 --> 36:15.116
I'm not going to hold you
to any promise.

36:15.151 --> 36:18.352
What are you talking about?

36:18.387 --> 36:22.156
I just want you
to think about it.

36:23.158 --> 36:27.795
Amy, I don't need
to think about it.

36:27.862 --> 36:31.765
We're engaged,
and we're gonna get married.

36:31.833 --> 36:36.303
I'm here for you no matter
what, I promise you.

36:37.238 --> 36:42.776
And if anything, this whole thing
has made me love you even more.

36:44.946 --> 36:49.416
It's made me realize
how precious our time is

36:49.450 --> 36:51.618
and how we shouldn't waste it.

36:52.553 --> 36:53.920
Any of it.

38:11.275 --> 38:14.109
You have the greenest eyes.

38:56.685 --> 39:00.087
Yes, her vision is improving
by the minute.

39:01.489 --> 39:05.293
<i>We'll bring her in to see you,</i>
<i>absolutely.</i>

39:05.327 --> 39:07.661
<i>Thank you, doctor, thank you.</i>

39:07.729 --> 39:10.030
<i>That's what she said.</i>

39:10.965 --> 39:12.499
<i>Yeah, no, it's amazing.</i>

39:12.534 --> 39:15.502
We're all just so,
so happy here.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.070
Okay, I'll see you soon.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.072
I love you, too. Bye.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.374
That was Peter.

39:20.408 --> 39:24.777
He's on his way, and he
said to give you a big hug.

39:24.812 --> 39:28.281
Ty, can I speak
to you for a second?

39:42.796 --> 39:46.733
I'm sorry things got
a little out of hand.

39:46.767 --> 39:50.536
Forget it,
it's not that big a deal.

39:50.604 --> 39:53.840
Well, you gotta know
that it's difficult

39:53.874 --> 39:59.912
for a father to sit back and watch
someone else fill his shoes.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.881
Tim, I'm not trying
to fill your shoes.

40:01.948 --> 40:03.983
I know, I understand.

40:06.353 --> 40:10.822
You're the real deal.
She's safe with you.

40:34.646 --> 40:36.680
Morning, cowboy.

40:40.319 --> 40:42.387
What's the matter?

40:44.556 --> 40:46.624
You got a text.

40:51.362 --> 40:53.297
Who's Andy?

40:54.466 --> 40:55.999
He's a friend.

41:00.238 --> 41:03.307
All right,
he's a boyfriend.

41:08.579 --> 41:17.954
Okay, he wants to marry me,
but I wanted to be sure

41:17.988 --> 41:20.056
that there was nothing
between you and me

41:20.090 --> 41:23.326
before I fully
committed myself to him.

41:23.360 --> 41:33.570
And now, I'm totally confused
because I'm still in love with you.

41:33.604 --> 41:35.137
You played me.

41:35.172 --> 41:37.206
No!

41:37.240 --> 41:41.110
No, I'm happy I did what I did.

41:41.144 --> 41:43.679
Now I know that I love you.

41:43.713 --> 41:48.617
Look, I'll go to Vancouver
and I'll break up with Andy.

41:48.651 --> 41:49.852
I want you gone.

41:49.886 --> 41:53.922
No, Caleb, you love me.

41:53.957 --> 41:56.525
I know that you love me.

41:57.827 --> 41:59.461
I'm leaving.

41:59.496 --> 42:02.097
When I come back,
I don't want to see you here.

42:02.164 --> 42:04.967
No, please, please,
Caleb, don't.
