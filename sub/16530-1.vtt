00:05.606 --> 00:06.507
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.141 --> 00:08.142
sexually based offenses

00:08.176 --> 00:11.245
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.381
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:13.414 --> 00:15.383
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.416 --> 00:16.384
are members of an elite squad

00:16.417 --> 00:19.053
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.087 --> 00:22.156
These are their stories.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.130

Pazite.

00:30.598 --> 00:31.632
Ali!

Pazite!

00:43.277 --> 00:46.147
- You want me to fly you like
the plane we took to Paris?

00:46.180 --> 00:47.315
- [laughing]
The plane to Paris!

00:47.348 --> 00:49.317
- That's right, Noah.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.285

Benson.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.347
Hey, Carisi, what's up?

01:22.316 --> 01:24.118
You know what?
I'll take care of it.

01:24.152 --> 01:27.455
I'm actually in the park
right now with Noah.

01:27.488 --> 01:31.525
Playground at 84th Street.
Officer Nolan?

01:31.559 --> 01:32.626
Got it.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.328
All right.
Come on, sweetie.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.397
- Found the kid
about 20 minutes ago.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.731
- Okay.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.367
- He doesn't seem
to speak English.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.701
My sergeant told me
to call SVU.

01:40.734 --> 01:41.702
- Great.
I got it from here.

01:41.735 --> 01:42.703
- Okay.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.405
- Hey, there.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.240
Hello.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.475
I'm Olivia.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.143
This is Noah.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.611
Where's your mommy?

01:50.644 --> 01:52.380
Did she come to the park
with you?

01:52.413 --> 01:55.716
Or maybe your daddy
or your grandma or your nanny?

01:55.749 --> 01:59.487
- [speaking native language]

01:59.520 --> 02:02.256
- Boom!
[laughs]

02:02.290 --> 02:04.758
Hey, sweetheart,
is your mama or dada here?

02:04.792 --> 02:07.261
Are they here somewhere
in the park?

02:07.295 --> 02:09.163
You know what, sweetheart?
Come with me,

02:09.197 --> 02:11.265
and I'm gonna help you find
your mama and your dada, okay?

02:11.299 --> 02:13.167
Come here.

02:13.201 --> 02:16.136
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.506
Oh, God.

Noah, get down, honey.

Sweetie, let's--

02:24.312 --> 02:25.713
let's put that down, okay?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.515
- Lieutenant?

02:27.548 --> 02:30.518
- It's okay, Officer Nolan.
I got this.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.720
It's okay, everyone.
I'm gonna ask you to--

02:32.753 --> 02:34.222
I'm gonna ask you to step back.

02:34.255 --> 02:37.358
*

02:37.391 --> 02:38.659
It's okay.
Look.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.294
Look.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.196
I'm not gonna hurt you.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.298
Can you put that down, honey?

02:44.332 --> 02:45.533
Just put that down.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.468
It's okay.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.338
It's okay, sweetheart.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

02:50.371 --> 02:51.605
I'm not gonna hurt--

02:59.813 --> 03:01.582
[tense music]

Okay.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.585
It's okay, honey.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.719
It's okay.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.688
No, it's okay, honey.

03:07.721 --> 03:08.789
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.291
Shh.
It's okay.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.361
It's okay. It's okay.
[siren wailing]

03:13.394 --> 03:14.528

[dramatic music]

04:01.975 --> 04:02.476
.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.210
- How is the boy?
- Oh, he's fine.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.647
A few bruises,
but no signs of sexual abuse.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.948
- But emotionally?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.583
- There are some signs
of trauma.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.419
- Did he say anything to you
in English?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.621
- He said a few words, but it
seems like his native language

04:13.654 --> 04:14.988
is Russian or something
Eastern European.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.558
- Yeah, Social Services
is looking for a translator.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.727
We're trying to track down
any family.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.463
- You said
he had a loaded gun?

04:22.496 --> 04:25.366
He's lucky to be alive.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.967
- Hey, Lou, bad news.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.003
The older woman in the bicycle
accident, she didn't make it.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.473
- Unis did find
a few witnesses in the park

04:32.506 --> 04:33.907
that put her
and the lost boy together.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.444
- You get an ID?
- Rahima Babic.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.011
We got a city card
with an address in Astoria.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.614
No cell phone, but we did find
kids' sunscreen in her bag.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.784
- So she could be
the grandmother or a caretaker.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.619
Let's just hope there
are parents in the picture.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.588
- Nothing on the Glock.
It's unregistered.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.022
They're tracking
the serial number.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.624
- We turn this over
to the precinct?

04:50.658 --> 04:52.593
- No, I want to keep it
for now.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.829
This kid got a gun
from someone, so run prints,

04:55.863 --> 04:58.732
touch DNA,
go to this Rahima's address

04:58.766 --> 04:59.867
and see what you can find.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.436
- Copy that.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.672
*

05:04.705 --> 05:05.673
- This is her.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.476
If this lady had a gun,
that was the only one.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.910
There's no other weapons here.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.979
- Well, the kid
was staying here.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.681
There's cereal
up in the cabinets,

05:13.714 --> 05:15.649
milk in the fridge,
juice boxes,

05:15.683 --> 05:17.451
takeout in the fridge.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.620
- Maybe Fin's getting somewhere
with the neighbors.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.988
- Oh.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.457
I think I figured out
the boy's first name.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.559
Ali.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.531
- Huh.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.599
Must be the mother.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.567
- Yeah.
"Ali's daily schedule.

05:33.601 --> 05:36.704
"6:30: wake up.
Breakfast, Cheerios.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.971
"7:00 a.m.: brush teeth.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.807
He likes his 'Ninja Turtles'
toothbrush."

05:39.840 --> 05:43.811
This goes on like this
for two pages.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.779
Look,
here's a separate note

05:45.813 --> 05:48.616
for the boy:
"Rahima, please tell Ali

05:48.649 --> 05:50.818
"that no matter what happens,
I love him more than anything

05:50.851 --> 05:52.820
in the world."

05:52.853 --> 05:55.589
- Sounds like she didn't know
when or if she was coming back.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.790
- Yeah.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.926
- Just found the neighbor,
Mr. Brian O'Malley.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.696
He said he knew the deceased,
Mrs. Babic.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.598
- Not very well.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.699
- What about her?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.801
- Yeah, I seen her a few times.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.003
She dumped the kid here
at Rahima's place.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.774
I assumed some relation,
an aunt probably.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.876
Lot of arguing.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.678
It's always something
with these people.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.112
- "These people"?

06:19.146 --> 06:20.881
- Immigrants.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.652
- Oh, and your people came here
on the Mayflower, huh?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.487
- We need to find
this boy's mother.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.855
Any ideas?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.122
- I think she worked
as a waitress.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.991
Don't ask me where.

06:31.024 --> 06:31.992
We done here?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.093
- Yeah, we're done.

06:35.829 --> 06:39.099
- That leftover in the fridge
is all from the same place--

06:39.132 --> 06:40.768
the diner Parthenon.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.135
- I know that place.
On 30th?

06:42.169 --> 06:44.705
- Mm.
- They got great spanakopita.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.141
*

06:48.175 --> 06:49.843
Excuse me, sir?

06:49.877 --> 06:50.844
Do you recognize this woman?

06:50.878 --> 06:52.112
- Ana Kapic.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.981
Yeah, she's one
of my waitresses.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.116
She hasn't shown up for
her shift the last three days.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.885
- You don't seem
too bothered by that.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.119
That a regular thing?

06:59.152 --> 07:01.655
- Ana comes, Ana goes.
[chuckles]

07:01.689 --> 07:04.758
What can I do?
I put up with it.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.760
I didn't know
she had a son.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.629
That poor thing.
[scoffs]

07:08.662 --> 07:10.564
- Why's that?

07:10.598 --> 07:13.100
- A lot of times, you know,
she'd show up with a black eye,

07:13.133 --> 07:14.635
bruises.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.036
Bad boyfriend I'm guessing.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.171
I don't ask questions.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.073
- We'll need her address,
her phone number.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.875
- Yeah, you got it.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.043
She in trouble?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.712
- Yeah, you could say that.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.750
- The store owner didn't
recognize Ana's picture or name.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.652
- Well, it's 2792 Broadway.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.053
This is the only address
the diner manager had

07:33.086 --> 07:34.154
in her employee file.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.923
- Rollins, there's no
apartments here, all right?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.758
They fix vacuum cleaners.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.992
Any luck tracking her number?

07:39.026 --> 07:41.194
- Yeah, TARU's on it.
Looks like a burner.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.195
- Okay.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.665
So fake address,

07:44.698 --> 07:45.799
burner cell,

07:45.833 --> 07:47.167
little kid with a loaded gun,

07:47.200 --> 07:49.069
and a good-bye note
from the mother?

07:49.102 --> 07:51.705
I mean, it sounds like this Ana
is either involved with a dealer

07:51.739 --> 07:54.207
or she's a prostitute
on the run.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.810
- Maybe her son's better off
at Social Services.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.613
- Yeah, but that note
she left--

07:59.647 --> 08:01.582
it sure seems like
she loves him.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.717
- Sometimes loving
ain't enough.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.721
- It's been ten hours,
and we are no closer

08:07.755 --> 08:09.957
to finding
the boy's parents.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.958
I just feel so--

08:10.991 --> 08:12.626
- Responsible?

08:12.660 --> 08:13.994
Because you found him?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.128
That kid held a loaded gun
on you.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.930
- He didn't know
what he was doing.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.632
- Even more dangerous.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.137
- All I could think about
was Noah.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.172
- Hey.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.042
You all right?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.712
- It's okay.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.982
So Conviction Integrity Unit.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.016
That's impressive.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.151
- Could be interesting...
[cell phone ringing]

08:38.185 --> 08:39.720
Working with the DA's office,

kicking the tires
on tricky cases.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.124
Kind of like
an in-house Innocence Project.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.693
- Sounds great.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.061
Benson.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.630
Great.
I'm on my way up.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.631
Thanks.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.165
Fin has a lead.
Bye.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.769
- [sighs]

08:57.871 --> 09:00.073
- Chief, hi.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.675
I didn't know
that you were coming in.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.143
- It's CompStat crap.
Just had a few questions.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.778
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.046
I wasn't aware that
there was a meeting.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.147
- It's 'cause
I didn't tell you.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.749
We've got things
under control.

09:08.782 --> 09:09.883
There's no need to bother
you with a bunch

09:09.917 --> 09:11.151
of administrative nonsense.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.653
- Oh, okay.
I get it.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.021
I--it's--

09:14.054 --> 09:15.856
you know, I just--
as a lieutenant,

09:15.889 --> 09:17.758
I think
it's probably important.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.793
- I said we've got it
under control.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.797
- Okay.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.666
You're the boss.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.776
- The lab picked up a partial
print off the Glock,

09:35.809 --> 09:37.811
a match for Luka Terzik.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.312
- Yeah, he's 26.
He was born in New York.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.981
He was arrested in 2014
for possession,

09:41.014 --> 09:42.683
but the charges were dropped.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.752
- Any idea if he's related
to the bike victim, Ana,

09:44.785 --> 09:46.019
or the little boy?

09:46.053 --> 09:47.688
- Well, I mean,
there is some resemblance.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.822
He could be the kid's father.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.924
- And all we know on Ana is that
she's Bosnian National,

09:50.958 --> 09:52.059
here on a student visa.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.794
We're trying to track down
her parents,

09:53.827 --> 09:55.062
and we're still waiting
on the boy's DNA.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.196
- We have a last known
for Luka?

09:56.229 --> 09:57.798
- Yeah, an apartment
in Queens.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.199
- Okay, well,
I'm not gonna hold my breath,

09:59.232 --> 10:01.101
but let's go take a look.
- We got it covered.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.805
- No, I want to talk to this guy
myself and ask him why his Glock

10:04.838 --> 10:07.908
was in the backpack
of a four-year-old.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.010
*

10:10.043 --> 10:11.979
Luka Terzik.
NYPD.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.981
We need to speak with you.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.983
- Abandoned kid,
the mother's missing.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.785
- Sounds like
exigent circumstances.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.920
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.824
- NYPD!

10:23.857 --> 10:25.192
[grunts]

10:25.225 --> 10:28.195
[dramatic music]

10:28.228 --> 10:34.334
*

10:34.367 --> 10:35.869
- Hey.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.772
*

10:38.806 --> 10:39.973
Luka and Ana
must be together.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.208
Looks like
Ali's their son.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.843
- They left in a hurry.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.778
*

10:44.812 --> 10:46.780
- And didn't want to leave
any evidence behind.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.115
- Hard drive's gone.

10:48.148 --> 10:55.155
*

10:58.191 --> 10:59.359
- Liv...

10:59.392 --> 11:01.128
we got a problem.

11:01.161 --> 11:08.101
*

11:08.135 --> 11:09.870
- Get back.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.972
Nobody touch anything.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.040
*

11:13.073 --> 11:14.908
- What are we looking at?

11:14.942 --> 11:17.911
*

11:17.945 --> 11:18.912
It's Arabic.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.814
*

11:20.848 --> 11:22.282
- Call ESU,

11:22.315 --> 11:24.785
Joint Terrorism,

11:24.818 --> 11:27.187
and the bomb squad.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.355
Go.

11:33.293 --> 11:33.426
.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.261
- Who are these people?
They terrorists?

11:35.362 --> 11:36.329
- We don't know.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.331
Luka is an American citizen.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.434
Ana is a legal immigrant
from Bosnia.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.203
Neither one
is on the watch list.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.438
Neither one has any known
connections to radical groups.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.340
- Are we interrogating
the kid?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.309
- He's four years old, Chief.
He doesn't speak any English.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.911
- Get a translator.
He might know something.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.813
JTTF is at the apartment?
- Tearing it apart.

11:52.846 --> 11:53.814
- I'm sure the Feds
are circling.

11:53.847 --> 11:54.848
- Already here.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.516
- All right, everybody,
listen up.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.953
I'm sure you're aware we have
a high-priority situation.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.957
Ana Kapic, Luka Terzik should be
considered armed and dangerous.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.425
We have reason to believe
they are planning

12:05.458 --> 12:07.294
a mass-casualty event.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.529
We have no idea what
the potential targets might be.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.966
- So we have their photos out
to all media outlets,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.936
every precinct in the city
as well as the outer boroughs.

12:15.969 --> 12:19.940
NYPD will coordinate with JTTF,
state police,

12:19.973 --> 12:21.508
and, of course, the FBI.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.243
We're all-in on this--

12:23.276 --> 12:26.746
round-the-clock shifts
until this crisis is resolved.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.950
- I assume we're talking
to anyone and everyone

12:29.983 --> 12:31.518
on this earth who might know
what they're planning.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.187
- We're interviewing
Ana's coworkers, her neighbors,

12:34.221 --> 12:35.856
and obviously trying to locate
any family

12:35.889 --> 12:37.858
or connections overseas.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.292
- Hey, Lou, we caught a break.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.228
- We tracked down
the management company

12:41.261 --> 12:42.863
for the apartment building, and
the rent on Terzik's apartment

12:42.896 --> 12:44.564
is paid by some guy
named Armin Sidran.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.366
- Okay.
What do we have on him?

12:46.399 --> 12:48.201
- He's not in the system,
not on any watch list.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.270
- But the address on the checks
is for a midtown office--

12:50.303 --> 12:51.371
an insurance company.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.539
- Go now.
- Go.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.275
[dramatic music]

12:55.308 --> 12:57.310
[siren wails]

[indistinct radio chatter]

13:00.347 --> 13:01.414
*

13:01.448 --> 13:02.850
- Armin Sidran?
- Yeah.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.251
- NYPD! Hands in the air!
- Hey! Hey!

13:04.284 --> 13:05.552
- Turn around!
- What's going on?

13:05.585 --> 13:06.987
What is this about?
I'm a U.S. citizen.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.521
- You know Luka Terzik?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.457
- What?
- Do you know Luka Terzik?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.359
- Yeah, he's my half brother.
- You pay his rent?

13:12.392 --> 13:13.526
- That's not of your business.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.527
- [yelling]
Do you pay his rent?

13:14.561 --> 13:15.996
- Yes!
- Why?

13:16.029 --> 13:17.330
- Because he's broke.
He needs help.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.932
- Is that him?
- Yes.

13:18.966 --> 13:19.967
- All right, who's this?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.268
- That's his fiancée, Ana.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.535
- Where's Luka and Ana
right now?

13:22.569 --> 13:23.603
- I have no idea
where they are.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.472
What the hell's going on?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.374
- Your brother's involved in
some sort of terrorist activity.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.575
- Terrorist?
No, you got the wrong guy.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.977
- You need to call him.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.945
- Excuse me?
- I said call him now!

13:31.979 --> 13:33.280
*

13:33.313 --> 13:34.948
- How about I call my lawyer
instead?

13:34.982 --> 13:36.049
*

13:36.083 --> 13:37.584
- Is that his number?
Luka's?

13:37.617 --> 13:39.920
Last call yesterday at noon.

13:39.953 --> 13:43.223
*

13:43.256 --> 13:44.591
- Armin?
Armin.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.559
- [yelling in native language]

13:46.593 --> 13:48.461
- Luka, listen to me!
Do not hang up!

13:48.495 --> 13:49.863
Do not hang up!
We can help you!

13:49.897 --> 13:51.564
You just need to tell me
where you are!

13:51.598 --> 13:53.967
Luka!

13:54.001 --> 13:56.569
Hey, have TARU triangulate
the location of that last call.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.570
Go now!

13:57.604 --> 13:58.872
- My brother's innocent.

13:58.906 --> 13:59.873
I demand a lawyer!

13:59.907 --> 14:01.474
- Shut up.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.511
[siren wailing]

14:05.913 --> 14:07.514
- Detectives.
- Is that the phone?

14:07.547 --> 14:08.982
Where'd you find it?
- The Dumpster.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.885
The screen is cracked,
and it's locked.

14:11.919 --> 14:12.986
- All right.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.321
Keep searching.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.489
*

14:16.523 --> 14:18.591
- TARU says that the number
you called Luka on

14:18.625 --> 14:20.427
was registered
to Armin Sidran.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.462
- All right, so he pays
his brother's rent

14:22.495 --> 14:23.463
and his phone bills.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.298
I mean,
who knows what else?

14:25.332 --> 14:27.935
- According to the Feds,
he's sticking to the party line.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.636
I mean, his brother's
a hapless buffoon.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.571
He has no idea why weapons
are in Luka's apartment.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.574
- Okay, so Luka realizes
it's not his brother calling,

14:34.607 --> 14:36.509
dumps the phone,
trashes it.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.511
He's trying to hide evidence,
just like his computer

14:38.545 --> 14:40.647
back in his apartment in Queens.
- So we get that to TARU.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.382
- No, they're not gonna be able
to unlock this phone

14:42.415 --> 14:43.583
without a passcode.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.685
Look, only the company
can decrypt it.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.387
- So what do we do now?

14:47.420 --> 14:48.989
*

14:49.022 --> 14:50.290
- We call Barba.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.524
*

14:51.558 --> 14:52.926
- We're not
investigating something

14:52.960 --> 14:54.427
that's already happened.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.029
We're investigating something
that's about to happen.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.097
We can prevent it.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.999
Your Honor, these people
represent an imminent threat

14:59.032 --> 15:00.233
to public safety.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.669
I need an emergency court order
to compel the manufacturer

15:02.702 --> 15:06.006
of the phone to unlock it
immediately.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.008
- That's a highly
unusual request.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.542
First, you need to get
an order to gain access

15:09.576 --> 15:11.311
to the personal information.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.612
- There isn't time
for any of that, Your Honor.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.481
- And there are no other means
to unlock the phone?

15:14.514 --> 15:16.016
- No.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.018
The registrant of the phone
is in FBI custody

15:18.051 --> 15:19.619
and isn't cooperating.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.388
His brother, who was once
in possession of the phone,

15:21.421 --> 15:22.322
is at large.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.656
Nothing has been backed up
to the cloud.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.025
- And you believe this phone

15:25.058 --> 15:26.659
is the only place
this evidence exists?

15:26.693 --> 15:27.727
- Yes.
- Your office has been

15:27.760 --> 15:29.496
down this road before,
Mr. Barba.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.331
- Yes, I know, Your Honor,
there are hundreds

15:31.364 --> 15:32.699
of locked phones
awaiting decryption.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.501
- All cases with court orders.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.669
All cases on appeal
by the manufacturer.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.571
- I understand,
but this is different.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.440
I believe the company
is trying to protect

15:40.473 --> 15:42.409
its position on privacy
for PR reasons,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.411
but given these
unique circumstances,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.146
if court ordered,
they might cooperate.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.550
- I will grant the order,
Mr. Barba.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.020
- Thank you.
- Godspeed getting the company

15:53.053 --> 15:54.587
to comply.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.023
- [sighs]

15:56.056 --> 15:58.558
- Hey, that was Barba.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.027
He got the judge
to grant an order

16:00.060 --> 16:01.628
to unlock the phone.
- Great.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.096
How long's that gonna take?

16:03.130 --> 16:04.764
Hours? Days?
- Well, we don't know.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.466
The manufacturer's
not cooperating.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.700
- Of course not.
It's not like there are

16:07.734 --> 16:09.069
people's lives in danger
or anything.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.737
- We're trying, Chief.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.640
- Try harder.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.143
- We have Luka's location--
at 11:20,

16:16.176 --> 16:18.145
when he got the call
from his brother's phone.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.647
We've implemented a grid search
block by block

16:20.680 --> 16:23.550
in the surrounding area.
- Liv, we got something.

16:23.583 --> 16:27.020
- Facial recognition got a hit
on a traffic cam 20 minutes ago.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.521
- A man identified
is Luka Terzik

16:28.555 --> 16:31.124
and a woman in her 20s--
looks like Ana, right?

16:31.158 --> 16:33.426
They were entering Central Park
on the west side of 72nd Street.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.727
- 1:00 in the afternoon.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.496
There are thousands of people
in the park.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.131
Check to see if there are
any concerts, plays, events.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.132
Now. Go.

Please.

.

18:14.994 --> 18:15.962
- So far, one dead,
four wounded--two critical.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.766
DOA is Tom Flannery.
- Flannery?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.268
- Off-duty NYPD.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.536
- [sighs]

18:23.570 --> 18:25.538
- Lieutenant Benson,
SVU, right?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.374
- Yes.
- Special Agent Dan Conley.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.609
- How can I help?
- The suspect isn't talking.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.544
The only thing
she cares about is her son.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.912
And since you found
the kid in the park,

18:32.945 --> 18:34.747
I was thinking maybe
you could speak to her.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.316
Let her know what happened,
that the boy is safe.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.218
Maybe she'll open up
and cooperate.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.353
- Okay, let's go.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.189
*

18:42.222 --> 18:44.824
- Do you know
where my son is?

18:44.857 --> 18:47.594
- I found him
in Central Park.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.796
He was all alone.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.931
He had a gun, too.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.601
- A gun?
- Mm.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.172
- He was--I left him
with my aunt.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.940
Rahima.
- I know.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.410
- So why was he alone?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.412
- Your aunt...

19:05.445 --> 19:07.947
she had an accident.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.684
- Is she okay?
- [whispers] No.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.887
She died.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.823
I'm sorry.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.691
- Ali.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.228
Can I see Ali?

19:21.261 --> 19:22.329
Please.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.931
I need to know
that he's okay.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.433
- I'm sure
we can arrange something,

19:26.466 --> 19:28.668
but we need to know more
about you and Luka.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.338
Were you working alone?

19:31.371 --> 19:32.772
- I don't know.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.307
- What do you mean
you don't know?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.709
- Ana, I need to know
who else was involved.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.845
ISIL?
Al-Qaeda?

19:38.878 --> 19:41.848
Are there other targets?
- Don't say another word.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.683
I want to talk
to my client.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.418
- Rita, you're representing
terrorists now?

19:45.452 --> 19:46.853
- Suspected terrorists.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.721
Everyone's entitled
to a defense.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.323
- We're not going anywhere.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.659
- You want to deny my client
her right to counsel?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.827
Is that what you're saying,
Mr. Conley?

19:54.861 --> 19:57.864
- We need to know
if other lives are at stake.

19:57.897 --> 20:01.334
- I want to talk to her alone.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.237
I understand the gravity
of the situation.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.273
Trust me.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.350
- You find anything?

20:17.384 --> 20:20.887
- Not yet. You?
- Not too much.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.356
Calhoun claims
that Ana was in the dark

20:23.390 --> 20:24.857
and just along for the ride.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.726
- That's one hell of a ride
to get on.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.429
Mass shooting in Central Park?
- Yeah, what do the Feds know?

20:29.462 --> 20:30.930
- Not a lot.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.765
Hey, anything?

20:32.799 --> 20:34.834
- The only news we have
is the brother of the shooter,

20:34.867 --> 20:35.868
Armin Sidran,

20:35.902 --> 20:38.371
is connected to a controversial
mosque in Queens.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.906
- Huh.
- Okay, he still in custody?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.941
- No, we let him go.
- Why is that?

20:41.974 --> 20:43.676
- He's more valuable
on the street.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.745
- It gives us a better chance
to pick up some chatter.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.880
Look, I know the lawyer
trusts you.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.482
I want you to take
another run at Ana.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.017
- Great. When?
- Tomorrow.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.385
After we formally indict her

20:52.419 --> 20:53.786
on murder
and terrorism charges.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.288
- Too late.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.390
The DA's Office
filed charges ten minutes ago.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.458
- All due respect, Chief--

20:58.491 --> 21:00.760
- Aw, save
the phony deference, Dan.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.495
The DOA is NYPD.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.963
Tom Flannery--
I knew him very well.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.798
We worked together
for a while.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.834
Good police.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.307
- Mr. Barba! Mr. Barba!
[reporters clamoring]

21:14.341 --> 21:15.508
Can you tell us
if the defendant is part

21:15.542 --> 21:16.809
of an organized terrorist group?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.378
- The investigation
is ongoing.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.381
The NYPD, the FBI,
and JTTF are working together

21:21.414 --> 21:22.915
to collect
all pertinent information.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.751
Look, right now
all that we know

21:24.784 --> 21:26.986
is that a decorated
New York City police officer

21:27.019 --> 21:28.855
with three children was killed

21:28.888 --> 21:31.858
and four other citizens were
shot and critically wounded.

21:31.891 --> 21:35.027
Regardless of the defendant's
motivation or affiliations,

21:35.061 --> 21:36.796
what this woman did
is called murder

21:36.829 --> 21:38.097
in the state of New York.
Thank you.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.432
[overlapping shouting]

21:39.466 --> 21:41.334
*

21:41.368 --> 21:42.969
- People versus Ana Kapic.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.904
One count murder
in the first degree,

21:44.937 --> 21:46.773
four counts
attempted murder.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.542
How does the defendant plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.844
- Mr. Barba, bail?
- Given the gravity

21:51.878 --> 21:53.112
of the charge
and her possible connections

21:53.145 --> 21:56.849
to organized terrorist groups,
we request remand.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.118
She's a Bosnian national
here on a student visa.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.788
She has no significant ties
to the community

22:01.821 --> 22:03.423
and represents
a major flight risk.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.358
- Ms. Calhoun?
- Despite Mr. Barba's

22:05.392 --> 22:08.127
impassioned, patriotic,
and xenophobic speech--

22:08.160 --> 22:09.929
- Get to it.
- We believe the defendant

22:09.962 --> 22:13.366
should be released
on her own recognizance.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.467
- For free?

22:14.501 --> 22:16.836
[galley murmuring]

22:16.869 --> 22:19.872
May I ask why you believe
that would be appropriate?

22:19.906 --> 22:22.775
- Because Ana Kapic
is a victim.

22:22.809 --> 22:26.379
She was raped and tortured
for hours before the homicide

22:26.413 --> 22:29.816
by her fiancé
and his brother.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.519
She may have been present
at the crime scene,

22:32.552 --> 22:35.087
but she was not there
under her own free will.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.991
If she didn't cooperate,
she herself

22:39.025 --> 22:40.627
would have been murdered.

22:40.660 --> 22:46.499
*

22:46.533 --> 22:48.635
[elevator bell dings]
- We have Ana at the scene.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.403
There's an AR-15
around her shoulder.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.971
She is five feet away
from the shooter.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.540
Yet somehow
she's the victim?

22:53.573 --> 22:55.908
- Okay, you think Calhoun
is just making this up?

22:55.942 --> 22:57.810
- I think she's desperately
looking for a defense.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.612
- Lieutenant,
affidavit from Ana.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.080
She claims that Luka
and his brother, Armin,

23:01.113 --> 23:02.982
repeatedly raped her
for the past five years.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.451
- Calhoun's just
covering her tracks,

23:04.484 --> 23:05.985
laying a record--
it means nothing.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.920
- It's a disclosure.
It means something.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.989
- Liv...
- Just because she is

23:10.022 --> 23:12.191
a murder defendant doesn't mean
that she's not a rape victim.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.426
- You're playing
into their defense.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.226
The more you investigate this,

23:14.260 --> 23:15.862
the more you
legitimize her story.

23:15.895 --> 23:16.896
- Okay, you telling me
to ignore it?

23:16.929 --> 23:18.431
- Just be careful.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.132
This case is too big,
it's too important,

23:20.166 --> 23:22.001
given what's been happening
lately--

23:22.034 --> 23:23.903
San Bernardino, Orlando...
- I know.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.905
- Dallas, France.
People are fed up.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.941
- I understand that, but--
- Ana needs to go down...hard.

23:28.975 --> 23:32.044
No matter how heartbreaking
or tragic her story might be.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.581
Right or wrong,
that's just how it is.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.082
- Well, you may be right.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.184
But no matter "how it is,"

23:38.217 --> 23:40.419
I would still
like to speak with Ana.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.125
I'm just here to listen,

23:46.158 --> 23:49.562
regardless of
what happened yesterday.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.498
- Lieutenant Benson
has agreed not to ask

23:51.531 --> 23:53.065
any questions
about the weapons,

23:53.099 --> 23:55.668
the shooting,
the death of the police officer.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.036
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

23:57.069 --> 23:59.972
- I just want to hear
what happened,

24:00.006 --> 24:02.441
what Armin and Luka
did to you.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.245
- I...

24:06.278 --> 24:08.481
I came here six years ago.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.019
I wanted to be a nurse.

24:14.186 --> 24:18.090
I lived with my aunt
in Queens.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.961
Then I met Luka.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.063
He was nice.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.999
He took me
to restaurants...

24:27.033 --> 24:29.035
clubs.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.572
I fell in love.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.910
But then things changed.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.646
He changed.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.113
- In what way?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.215
- He was angry all the time.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.652
He hated everyone--

24:45.685 --> 24:49.522
rich people, Jews,
gay people, blacks.

24:49.556 --> 24:52.191
And then he started
to hit me.

24:54.193 --> 24:57.530
And make me have sex
even if I didn't want to.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.232
His brother, too.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.268
They would do it together.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.172
- How long
did this go on?

25:06.205 --> 25:08.140
- For years.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.942
- Did you tell anyone?

25:09.976 --> 25:11.544
- No.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.112
I was too afraid.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.548
They said they'd kill me...

25:15.582 --> 25:18.317
that I'd never see
my son, Ali, again...

25:18.350 --> 25:20.152
[somber music]

25:20.186 --> 25:22.221
And that I would die a whore

25:22.254 --> 25:24.657
because they had video.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.126
They were gonna make it
look like I was having fun,

25:27.159 --> 25:29.095
then send it to my family.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.633
- When was the last time
Luka and Armin assaulted you?

25:36.202 --> 25:38.571
- Two mornings ago.
- What time?

25:38.605 --> 25:41.574
- Early.
It was still dark.

25:41.608 --> 25:44.711
I remember hearing
the garbage truck outside.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.713
The sound.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.715
That's all I thought about.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.683
It's what I focused on,

25:50.717 --> 25:53.653
the sound of the truck--

25:53.686 --> 25:55.588
the whir, the screech.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.690
- Show her
what they did to you.

25:57.724 --> 26:04.731
*

26:08.768 --> 26:11.738
- I hit Armin in the face
while he was--

26:11.771 --> 26:13.105
[inhales deeply]

26:13.139 --> 26:15.608
And he and Luka got mad.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.744
So they beat me...

26:17.777 --> 26:19.612
with their belts.

26:20.379 --> 26:23.315
I wanted to do something...

26:23.349 --> 26:26.653
to call the police.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.688
But I was afraid...

26:29.656 --> 26:31.357
for myself,

26:31.390 --> 26:33.125
for Ali.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.662
I didn't want
anyone else to die.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.129
*

26:37.163 --> 26:39.131
Please forgive me.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.167
[sniffles]

26:42.769 --> 26:44.270
[crying]
I'm sorry.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.072
I'm sorry.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.339
- I want to do
a rape kit.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.809
*

26:54.313 --> 26:54.413
.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.447
- The rape kit confirms
vaginal and anal intercourse.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.686
There was tearing, abrasions.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.354
They found some semen, too.
We're running the DNA.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.824
This woman was brutalized.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.893
- Okay, she was raped.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.395
Doesn't mean she didn't kill
Flannery or that college kid.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.297
- What?
- Yeah, I just got a text.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.766
She passed 20 minutes ago.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.135
Name is Sophie Lewis,
21 years old.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.104
Originally from
Worcester, Massachusetts.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.772
- I agree with Dodds.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.675
The rape claim has nothing to do
with the criminal charges.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.843
It could make her
more sympathetic

27:23.876 --> 27:25.344
in the eyes of a jury.

27:25.377 --> 27:26.813
Raise the question,
"Was she really a willing

27:26.846 --> 27:28.314
participant in the crime?"

27:28.347 --> 27:30.349
- Put the brakes on
the rape investigation for now,

27:30.382 --> 27:31.718
till the trial is over.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.753
Let the defense claim rape
all they want.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.354
- I understand that there's
something bigger at play here.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.857
I really do. I get it,
but I'm--I'm not sure

27:37.890 --> 27:40.226
that that should matter.

27:40.259 --> 27:43.462
- Are you serious?
- With all due respect, Chief...

27:43.495 --> 27:46.465
I can't not do this.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.900
I'm just trying to do my job.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.702
- With all due respect,
you doing your job

27:49.736 --> 27:51.771
cost my son his life.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.741
[tense music]

27:54.774 --> 28:01.480

28:01.513 --> 28:03.783
I, uh--
[stammering]

28:03.816 --> 28:05.818
I-I didn't--

28:07.820 --> 28:14.827
*

28:17.496 --> 28:19.365
- He didn't mean it.

28:19.398 --> 28:22.334
- Sure he did.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.836
He's not wrong either.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.304
- Hey.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.339
Don't do that.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.879
- Look, I understand that
we all want somebody to pay

28:32.912 --> 28:35.281
for what happened,
but...

28:35.314 --> 28:37.416
I'm not sure that
that person is Ana.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.251
- You're wrong.

28:39.285 --> 28:40.987
- She was beaten and raped

28:41.020 --> 28:43.422
less than 48 hours
before the attack.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.991
- Irrelevant.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.292
She's just as guilty as Luka.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.995
Rape or no rape,
she's a killer.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.763
That's what I'm gonna
tell the jury.

28:50.797 --> 28:54.333
[cell phone vibrates]

28:54.366 --> 28:57.236
- The DNA came back
on the boy, Ali.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.372
The father
is Luka's brother, Armin...

29:02.875 --> 29:05.244
Which means that he has
paternal rights.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.779
- Liv, I understand--
- You understand?

29:06.813 --> 29:08.480
If Ana's going to prison, right?
- Mm-hmm.

29:08.514 --> 29:12.785
- If the Feds can't come up
with a case against Armin,

29:12.819 --> 29:16.322
then that monster is gonna get
custody of that boy.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.490
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to investigate

29:18.524 --> 29:22.428
a case that everyone wants
me to ignore.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.363
[dramatic music]

29:24.396 --> 29:25.898
- Are you crazy?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.466
I would never even think
about such a thing.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.335
She was engaged to my brother!

29:29.368 --> 29:30.803
That's the beginning
and the end of this.

29:30.837 --> 29:31.938
- We're more concerned
with the middle.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.305
- Excuse me?

29:33.339 --> 29:34.406
- Ana claims
that you raped her.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.508
- Forced her to?
Please.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.477
- So the sex
was consensual?

29:38.510 --> 29:40.279
- I told you,
we never had sex.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.949
It was neither consensual
nor nonconsensual.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.484
It never happened.
I would never do that to Luka.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.319
- Right,
'cause you're such a gentleman.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.488
- And you're a liar.
- The hell you talking about?

29:49.521 --> 29:52.058
- We ran Ali's DNA.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.826
You're the father.
Ana's the mother.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.863
So, unless you had in vitro,
you two had sex.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.503
- Okay, fine.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.405
You're right.

30:06.438 --> 30:09.041
I had sex with her...
a few times.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.280
- Sit down.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.850
- She's a whore.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.386
- That's not a nice word.
- She's not a nice woman.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.554
She's a manipulator.
A user.

30:22.588 --> 30:26.292
She came here, and she ruined
my brother's life!

30:26.325 --> 30:28.294
She turned him
into a killer,

30:28.327 --> 30:29.395
a radical.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.997
- Where were you
two mornings ago?

30:31.030 --> 30:33.299
- I was home in bed till 8:30,
and then I went to work.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.934
- So you weren't
at Luka's apartment?

30:34.967 --> 30:35.902
- No.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.536
- So you didn't have
sex with her that morning?

30:37.569 --> 30:39.505
- Of course not.
- So those scars

30:39.538 --> 30:41.140
and those bruises
on her stomach

30:41.173 --> 30:42.909
and on her legs
and on her back--

30:42.942 --> 30:44.944
- Is that the belt
you used on her?

30:46.412 --> 30:48.147
- Hey,
she asked you a question.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.917
- I want a lawyer.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.085
- Okay.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.087
But you're going down

30:55.121 --> 30:56.923
with or without
a lawyer.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.425
- Ana is a terrorist...

30:59.458 --> 31:00.927
and a tramp.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.461
Do you really think
anyone cares about her?

31:02.494 --> 31:05.431
- I do,
and so does she.

31:05.464 --> 31:08.634
And trust me,
that's enough.

31:08.667 --> 31:14.573
*

31:14.606 --> 31:17.676
[door opens, closes]

31:17.709 --> 31:20.046
*

31:20.079 --> 31:21.180
- The defendant's claims

31:21.213 --> 31:22.949
regarding a potential
sexual assault

31:22.982 --> 31:25.651
are legally and logically
irrelevant to her culpability

31:25.684 --> 31:28.587
in the murder of Tom Flannery
and Sophie Lewis.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.090
The introduction of this type
of unsubstantiated,

31:31.123 --> 31:33.159
extraneous,
and salacious evidence

31:33.192 --> 31:34.660
is more prejudicial
than probative.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.429
It should be excluded.
- Ana Kapic was repeatedly

31:37.463 --> 31:41.633
beaten, raped, and tortured
over a period of five years.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.170
She was a prisoner
in her own home,

31:44.203 --> 31:47.573
unable to exercise her own
free will or personal autonomy

31:47.606 --> 31:51.077
for fear of losing
her son and her life.

31:51.110 --> 31:55.014
As such, she was acting
under extreme duress...

31:55.047 --> 31:58.550
which we intend to assert
as an affirmative defense.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.953
- I understand your intent,
Counselor,

32:00.987 --> 32:02.554
but I don't want to turn
my murder case

32:02.588 --> 32:04.156
into a rape trial.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.425
I can't just take
your client's word for it.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.994
- I understand.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.595
You need the word
of someone objective,

32:09.628 --> 32:11.563
knowledgeable,

32:11.597 --> 32:13.232
like Lieutenant Benson

32:13.265 --> 32:16.002
from the Special Victims Unit,
for example.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.571
Lieutenant, are you
currently investigating

32:19.605 --> 32:22.208
Ana Kapic's rape allegations?
- Yes, I am.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.076
- Do these allegations
appear credible?

32:24.110 --> 32:26.078
- Absolutely.
I am convinced

32:26.112 --> 32:30.149
without a doubt
that Ana Kapic is the victim

32:30.182 --> 32:33.585
of a brutal
and forcible sexual assault.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.588
[dramatic music]

32:36.622 --> 32:40.526
*

32:40.559 --> 32:43.029
- Are you a cop
or a defense lawyer?

32:44.130 --> 32:45.731
- I did
what I thought was right.

32:45.764 --> 32:47.466
- You are aware
that our goal

32:47.499 --> 32:49.101
is to win this case?
- I am.

32:49.135 --> 32:52.504
What did you want me to do?
Perjure myself?

32:52.538 --> 32:54.140
- I just got done
talking to the Chief,

32:54.173 --> 32:55.707
the DA, and the Mayor.
They're livid.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.243
Already looking
for a head to serve up

32:57.276 --> 32:59.078
on a shiny, silver platter.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.712
They stuck their necks out
with the Feds

33:00.746 --> 33:03.015
just to get this case.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.683
Losing is not an option.

33:04.716 --> 33:08.220
So, please,
pretend you're on our side...

33:08.254 --> 33:10.189
not theirs.

33:10.222 --> 33:14.526
*

33:14.560 --> 33:16.162
- You looking for a fight, too?

33:16.195 --> 33:17.196
- I understand
what you're doing.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.564
It's admirable--
- But?

33:18.597 --> 33:20.699
- It's stupid,
self-centered, idealistic.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.668
- But rape is rape.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.570
We don't get to invent
our victims

33:24.603 --> 33:25.804
or our perps.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.774
We hear the evidence,
and we investigate...

33:28.807 --> 33:30.476
unless, of course,
you're a Muslim woman

33:30.509 --> 33:31.577
who's accused of murder,

33:31.610 --> 33:34.113
and then we just throw you
under the patriotic bus

33:34.146 --> 33:36.082
and live our merry lives.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.749
- I came here to tell you
the judge ruled in our favor.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.551
- Not our favor.
Your favor.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.820
- Either way, the rape testimony
isn't coming in.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.290
Liv, like I keep
telling you,

33:44.323 --> 33:46.292
this case is different.

33:58.737 --> 33:58.870
.

33:58.904 --> 33:59.638
- What do you
want to talk about?

34:01.307 --> 34:03.209
My opening argument?
- Rita, it's--it's over.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.643
- I know we lost the motion.
I get it.

34:04.676 --> 34:05.777
But we still have
a defense.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.446
- But you're not going to win.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.781
This case is too important
to too many people.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.583
- Are you saying
the fix is in?

34:11.617 --> 34:14.353
- I'm saying that it's time
to cut a deal...

34:14.386 --> 34:16.188
for Ana's sake.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.790
Barba will listen today--now.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.726
But once this goes to trial,
he's gonna have no choice

34:20.759 --> 34:22.361
but to max her out.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.729
- That's not a reason
to cut a deal.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.598
- No, but this is.

34:26.632 --> 34:29.401
Armin Sidran is seeking
sole custody

34:29.435 --> 34:30.736
of the little boy Ali.

34:30.769 --> 34:34.373
So, if you cut a deal

34:34.406 --> 34:35.774
on the murder
and terrorism charge,

34:35.807 --> 34:39.378
it will give us more leverage
to pursue the rape case...

34:39.411 --> 34:41.313
and make sure that Armin
never goes near

34:41.347 --> 34:43.482
that little boy again.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.288
- Without being able to discuss
the mental and sexual abuse

34:49.321 --> 34:51.423
Ana suffered,
we have no case,

34:51.457 --> 34:54.260
which, of course, is why
the judge ruled the way she did.

34:54.293 --> 34:58.664
Due process is the cornerstone
of our judicial system

34:58.697 --> 35:01.333
unless the term
"radical Islam" is involved.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.468
- Rita--
- Then it's just

35:02.501 --> 35:04.503
an inconvenient nuisance.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.439
- The charge
has to be murder one.

35:07.473 --> 35:11.343
- And we'll accept
on two conditions.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.712
One, at sentencing,

35:13.745 --> 35:15.714
you'll advocate
for 20 to life

35:15.747 --> 35:18.884
and keep the possibility
of parole on the table.

35:18.917 --> 35:22.388
Two, you'll agree to use
your best efforts

35:22.421 --> 35:24.456
to prosecute Armin for rape.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.658
- I can't agree to that.
- On the record, you can't.

35:26.692 --> 35:30.429
Off the record,
you can look me in the eye

35:30.462 --> 35:31.630
and nod.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.265
- Lieutenant Benson
is investigating the case.

35:33.299 --> 35:34.666
If she finds
sufficient evidence--

35:34.700 --> 35:36.602
- You'll be told
by your bosses to bury it

35:36.635 --> 35:38.637
because Ana is evil.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.779
- I don't want my son
to be raised by that man.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.715
He will ruin him,

35:49.748 --> 35:52.884
turn him into a monster,
a killer.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.720
- Lieutenant Benson
is investigating the case.

35:54.753 --> 35:55.887
If she finds
sufficient evidence--

35:55.921 --> 35:58.390
- For God's sake.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.292
The good guys already won.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.294
You can fly the flag
and declare victory.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.929
I get it.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.665
Deep down,
you know the truth.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.667
Ana's not evil.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.937
She's not a killer.
She is a rape victim.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.341
[dramatic music]

36:15.374 --> 36:17.509
*

36:17.543 --> 36:18.744
- I'll do my best.

36:18.777 --> 36:25.751
*

36:25.784 --> 36:29.421
- What do you mean
there's not enough evidence?

36:29.455 --> 36:30.222
- And hello to you.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.391
The evidence--
- Is overwhelming.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.760
We have Armin's semen.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.529
There's vaginal
and anal tearing.

36:37.563 --> 36:40.332
There's bruises,
not to mention Ana's testimony.

36:40.366 --> 36:41.700
- I understand, and usually
that would be enough,

36:41.733 --> 36:42.768
but given the--
- You told her

36:42.801 --> 36:44.970
that you would do your best
to prosecute this case.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.838
- I am doing my best.
Trust me.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.607
The defense is gonna claim
that Ana's a whore

36:48.640 --> 36:49.941
who craves rough sex.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.710
She's a convicted murderer
and terrorist.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.745
- Okay, so you need more.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.615
What about a video

36:56.648 --> 36:59.351
of Luka and Armin
raping and beating her?

36:59.385 --> 37:01.620
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, it exists.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.855
Luka used to record
the brutality

37:03.889 --> 37:05.524
as a way of maintaining
control over her.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.559
The problem is--
- It's on the locked phone.

37:10.496 --> 37:12.564
*

37:12.598 --> 37:14.600
- We believe video evidence
of a rape exists

37:14.633 --> 37:16.468
on Luka Terzik's phone.

37:16.502 --> 37:19.638
We believe there may be evidence
of a potential terrorist threat

37:19.671 --> 37:21.740
on this device as well.
Moreover...

37:21.773 --> 37:23.642
we believe that
this is the only place

37:23.675 --> 37:25.010
this evidence exists.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.912
As such,
pursuant to the All Writs Act,

37:26.945 --> 37:28.614
this court
should grant an order

37:28.647 --> 37:31.750
compelling the manufacturer
to unlock this phone.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.485
- Mr. Gilman.

37:33.519 --> 37:34.920
- Your Honor,

37:34.953 --> 37:37.689
the All Writs Act
was written in 1789.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.491
It clearly
does not contemplate--

37:39.525 --> 37:41.860
nor permit the court
to force a private company

37:41.893 --> 37:44.963
to assist the government
in a criminal investigation.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.898
The reason our company
is so popular

37:46.932 --> 37:49.468
is because our customers know
our products are secure.

37:49.501 --> 37:52.438
If we were to create software
that unlocks one phone,

37:52.471 --> 37:53.905
we would be, in effect,
creating software

37:53.939 --> 37:55.974
that unlocks all phones.

37:56.007 --> 37:59.044
This would create a much wider
crack in the overall security

37:59.077 --> 38:00.879
for all of our customers,
which would, in turn,

38:00.912 --> 38:02.748
result in a far more
substantial threat

38:02.781 --> 38:04.783
to national security.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.653
- The good news is we won.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.422
The bad news is they appealed
within seconds.

38:10.456 --> 38:13.959
- So it's back to square one?
- For a while.

38:13.992 --> 38:17.563
- Look, I know you wanted more,
but we have a strong case.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.834
- I'm not certain
the DA would support

38:22.868 --> 38:24.670
moving forward
with this right now,

38:24.703 --> 38:25.837
given the political climate.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.540
- Yes, I know...

38:28.574 --> 38:30.976
that some monster just shot up
a gay club in Orlando

38:31.009 --> 38:34.913
and another one killed
five police officers in Dallas.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.649
It's horrific.
We're under siege.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.551
Nobody knows
what's gonna happen next.

38:39.585 --> 38:40.919
*

38:40.952 --> 38:43.489
But Ana deserves justice
for what happened to her.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.457
- Liv--
- All she has left is her kid.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.793
She just wants him
to be safe.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.028
I'm going to arrest
that son of a bitch.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.997
*

38:52.030 --> 38:55.000
[sirens wailing]

38:55.033 --> 38:58.670
*

38:58.704 --> 38:59.871
Everyone got their vests on?

38:59.905 --> 39:02.073
- Yeah, we're all good, Lou.
Promise.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.975
- Okay, follow my lead.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.678
*

39:06.712 --> 39:09.581
What is that?

39:09.615 --> 39:11.883
Hey!
What's going on?

39:11.917 --> 39:14.786
- We picked up
some chatter last night.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.021
- Chatter?
- He's been talking

39:16.054 --> 39:18.624
to known radicals
in Afghanistan.

39:19.858 --> 39:20.826
- Okay.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.594
I have a warrant
for his arrest.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.763
- That will have to wait.
- For how long?

39:24.796 --> 39:26.832
- Not sure.
- Months? Years?

39:26.865 --> 39:29.601
- Unclear.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.136
- Where are you taking him?

39:31.169 --> 39:35.073
- To a very special
and secure hotel.

39:35.106 --> 39:42.113
*

39:53.625 --> 39:56.061
[van doors close]

40:08.840 --> 40:12.077
- You don't have to worry
about Armin anymore.

40:13.679 --> 40:15.013
- So my son...

40:16.815 --> 40:19.818
- We contacted your sister,
Shanik...

40:21.653 --> 40:25.156
And she's on her way here now--
to New York.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.727
And Ali is going to go
live with her

40:28.760 --> 40:30.195
in Bosnia.

40:30.228 --> 40:33.198
[gentle music]

40:33.231 --> 40:34.600
*

40:34.633 --> 40:36.001
- Thank you.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.003
*

40:38.036 --> 40:39.771
It's time.

40:39.805 --> 40:42.941
*

40:42.974 --> 40:45.644
It's time to say good-bye.

40:45.677 --> 40:52.684
*

41:09.935 --> 41:12.638
- [babbling]

41:12.671 --> 41:15.106
- Oh...mwah!

41:19.978 --> 41:21.980
Hey, sweet boy.

41:23.749 --> 41:27.152
- Long week, huh?
- Yeah.

41:27.185 --> 41:30.221
Yeah.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.190
The funny thing is...

41:32.223 --> 41:34.760
[voice breaking]
I've never been happier.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.098
- Then why you crying?

41:40.131 --> 41:42.701
- Because I'm scared
that it won't last.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.135
- That's not true.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.171
Not if I can help it.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.279
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.648
It's a beautiful day.

42:40.025 --> 42:43.028
