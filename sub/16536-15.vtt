WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:03.087
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:03.212 --> 00:06.132
- I am so glad to have you back.
- I'm not coming back.

00:06.257 --> 00:08.467
I'll try and do the job
as well as you did.

00:08.592 --> 00:09.885
Do better.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.388
Tell me everything you know
about that woman.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.306
We'll find her,
and we'll make her pay.

00:14.432 --> 00:15.891
It's not gonna bring my son back.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.561
Claudine Poyet.

00:19.770 --> 00:20.980
That's her.

00:21.105 --> 00:23.941
I hereby authorize you
to use whatever means necessary

00:24.066 --> 00:26.986
to find the people involved in this
conspiracy and bring them to justice.

00:27.111 --> 00:29.947
- Are you still up for this?
- I haven't even gotten started yet.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.332
Thank you. Thank you.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.543
Please, everyone, take your seats.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.463
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.466
In the brief time I have been in office,

00:48.591 --> 00:52.178
we've experienced an extraordinary
amount of tragedy together.

00:52.303 --> 00:55.347
Today, however,
I'd like to ask you to join me

00:55.473 --> 00:57.641
in opening a new chapter in our history.

00:58.142 --> 01:01.520
Most presidencies are judged
by their first hundred days,

01:01.645 --> 01:05.357
when a president rolls out his policy
initiatives for the next four years.

01:05.483 --> 01:08.194
Circumstances denied us
that initial opportunity,

01:08.319 --> 01:10.613
but I am hoping today,
with your permission,

01:10.738 --> 01:12.281
to reset the clock.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.992
I would like my first hundred days
to begin now.

01:16.494 --> 01:19.789
<i>Over the coming weeks, I will be
announcing a broad agenda</i>

01:19.914 --> 01:21.540
<i>to address critical issues
throughout the nation,</i>

01:21.665 --> 01:23.042
<i>issues that matter deeply to me...</i>

01:23.167 --> 01:24.877
- How's he doing?
<i>- ...such as civil rights...</i>

01:25.002 --> 01:27.880
- Twitter thinks he's crushing it.
<i>- ...healthcare, affordable housing,</i>

01:28.005 --> 01:31.550
job creation, climate change, immigration,

01:31.675 --> 01:34.553
balancing the budget, and debt reduction.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.014
Clearly,
we have a lot of work to do.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.350
I will be relying upon

01:39.475 --> 01:42.520
<i>the leadership of both houses
to work with me in a nonpartisan spirit,</i>

01:42.645 --> 01:45.731
<i>putting country before party,
but I will also be relying</i>

01:45.856 --> 01:48.692
<i>upon the good will and highest ideals
of the American people,</i>

01:48.818 --> 01:51.904
<i>which is why I'll be holding
a town-hall meeting this week</i>

01:52.029 --> 01:53.823
<i>at the college of William and Mary</i>

01:53.948 --> 01:56.826
<i>to begin what I hope will become
a national discussion,</i>

01:56.951 --> 01:59.078
as together we reset the clock...

01:59.203 --> 02:01.080
...and work to build a better America.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.581
Thank you.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.501
<i>I'm expecting you have some questions.</i>

02:05.626 --> 02:07.002
<i>Please.</i>

02:07.128 --> 02:10.172
Mr. President, you mentioned
you want to start a new chapter.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.049
Does that mean you're putting
the fight against terrorists,

02:12.174 --> 02:13.425
like Al-Sakar, on the back burner?

02:13.551 --> 02:15.678
<i>Absolutely not. National security...</i>

02:15.803 --> 02:17.847
Does it ever weird you out
that you and Dad are,

02:17.972 --> 02:20.224
like... the President and the First Lady?

02:20.349 --> 02:22.434
<i>...responsibility to promote
the general welfare...</i>

02:22.560 --> 02:24.103
Yes. Every day.

02:24.228 --> 02:27.106
That is all we're doing here.
We're getting back to governing.

02:27.231 --> 02:31.193
We have a responsibility
to meet the needs of all Americans.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.286
So, uh... how long
were you planning to stay?

02:40.411 --> 02:42.538
- Why, are you trying to get rid of me?
- What?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.123
No, no, just the opposite.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.292
I was thinking of getting you
a better futon. That's all.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.627
Oh, it's fine. I'll probably only stay
a couple days.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.922
I just needed to be somewhere where
nobody would think to find me, you know?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.425
Right.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.638
So you said you ran Claudine Poyet's
photo through facial recognition?

02:59.763 --> 03:02.474
Yeah, I thought Langdon's cellphone photo
would give us a better hit than yours,

03:02.600 --> 03:06.270
- but so far, nothing. The woman's a ghost.
- Ghosts are visions of the dead.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.063
This woman is alive,
and she has a name.

03:08.189 --> 03:11.817
Yeah, well... I could be a lot more
impressive if, for once, you gave me more

03:11.942 --> 03:14.778
than just the hint of a sliver of a clue
to work with.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.447
Well, I wouldn't want to spoil you.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.617
What about the timeline
of her relationship with Langdon,

03:19.742 --> 03:22.286
- retracing their steps?
- Been there, done that, twice.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.294
Chuck, what about fingerprints?

03:31.045 --> 03:32.838
Yeah, that would be great if we had them.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.965
Can you pull fingerprints off a photo?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.468
The wine glass.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.305
The resolution isn't exactly ready
for prime time.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.390
It's okay, just see what you can do.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.531
- Amazing.
- Here all week.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.910
Run it through the IAFIS database.
Get me everything you can on her.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.552
I know I've said this before,
but I think it's worth repeating.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.846
It's not that we don't care
about hot-button issues.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.474
It's just that we can't afford
to get bogged down by controversy

04:25.599 --> 04:27.893
when Americans are worried
about feeding their families

04:28.018 --> 04:29.645
or the price of chemotherapy.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.731
Seth, I've got the staff director
from the Senate Energy Committee.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.817
He wants to know where
the President stands on fuel cells.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.402
Sure, tell him the President
loved fuel cells

04:36.527 --> 04:38.904
10 years ago, just like everybody else,
but the technology hasn't advanced,

04:39.029 --> 04:40.739
so he'd like to stick to wind and solar.

04:40.864 --> 04:45.369
Yes, we still think it's worth revisiting
raising the minimum social security age.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.079
There's a lot of support from the group--

04:47.204 --> 04:48.539
No, that's radioactive.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.083
Hi, this is Emily Rhodes,
the White House Chief of Staff.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.751
Who's this? Hi, Katie.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.670
Social security will absolutely
be addressed.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.672
It just can't happen
in the first hundred days.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.549
Keep working on it, though.
Thank you.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.595
Add social security
to things we will address on day 101.

05:03.721 --> 05:06.890
It kills me to run triage on issues that
are actually affecting people's lives.

05:07.016 --> 05:10.519
We need momentum, we're not gonna get it
by being divisive right out of the gate.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.230
Uh, folks, could I have
your attention, please?

05:13.355 --> 05:16.859
You know, if... if we waste the goodwill
of the American people right now,

05:16.984 --> 05:20.112
the President doesn't stand a chance
in Hell of getting anything done, okay?

05:20.237 --> 05:21.405
Wow.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.032
No pressure there.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.285
Please, keep your seats.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.828
Don't let me interrupt.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.290
Hey, how's it going here?

05:31.415 --> 05:32.875
Great, you hit it out of the park.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.587
We're getting calls from Congress,
special interests, R.P.s - real people.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.630
People are excited to contribute
to your new agenda.

05:38.756 --> 05:39.798
- Good.
- The more public support

05:39.923 --> 05:41.884
we can build for you
before the town hall, the better.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.470
That way, we can use it to pressure
Congress into supporting your agenda.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.722
- Otherwise...
- We don't have a chance in Hell.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.140
Yeah.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.101
Everyone, I'm sorry. I know I said
I didn't want to interrupt,

05:51.226 --> 05:52.895
but I'm the President
of the United States,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.814
and I get to change my mind.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.902
Franklin Delano Roosevelt passed 76 bills
in his first hundred days.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.988
If we can accomplish half of that -
hell, a third -

06:03.113 --> 06:06.408
our government will be
the phoenix rising from the ashes.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.868
Keep it up. Thank you all.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.550
Aaron Shore.

07:12.474 --> 07:15.686
We can't pretend
that anything is as it was

07:15.811 --> 07:17.688
before the Capitol was attacked.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.523
The very fact that
I'm standing here before you

07:19.648 --> 07:22.025
as First Lady
should be proof enough of that.

07:22.151 --> 07:25.237
But there are certain things
that haven't changed.

07:25.362 --> 07:29.491
When it comes to men and women,
there are still two different standards

07:29.616 --> 07:31.201
for work-life balance.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.996
And don't even get me started
on the gender pay gap.

07:35.831 --> 07:39.585
But it is my hope that as
community leaders, as mentors,

07:39.710 --> 07:43.755
as mothers, daughters, partners,
we can lead this country

07:43.881 --> 07:46.091
out of the ashes of tragedy

07:46.216 --> 07:49.428
and into a more enlightened future
for all of us.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.680
Thank you so much.

07:52.723 --> 07:55.434
Before we lose you,
we collected a few questions

07:55.559 --> 07:57.769
from the audience earlier,
if you don't mind.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.396
Um, certainly.

08:00.063 --> 08:03.192
First question:
"Do you miss practicing law?"

08:03.317 --> 08:04.776
Absolutely, yes.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.196
It was and is a huge part of who I am,

08:07.321 --> 08:11.783
but no complaints. Public service
is very much ingrained

08:11.909 --> 08:13.243
in both Tom and myself.

08:13.911 --> 08:17.956
Next question: "Considering our country
recently witnessed two separate acts

08:18.081 --> 08:19.958
of gun violence -

08:20.083 --> 08:22.586
the death of Vice President MacLeish,

08:22.711 --> 08:24.963
and the assassination attempt
on your husband -

08:25.088 --> 08:28.300
what are your views
regarding gun policy in America?

08:28.425 --> 08:29.551
Oh!

08:29.676 --> 08:33.429
Honestly, this was something
that deeply concerned me

08:33.554 --> 08:36.433
long before Tom and I ended up
in the White House.

08:36.558 --> 08:40.645
When something as simple
as a mandatory background check

08:40.770 --> 08:43.148
can't get through Congress,
then, honestly,

08:43.273 --> 08:45.776
I have to wonder how we got here.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.819
How do we tell our children

08:47.945 --> 08:50.322
that we are doing everything
to keep them out of danger?

08:50.447 --> 08:52.908
I don't know the answers
to these questions,

08:53.033 --> 08:57.371
but I do know that we need to deal
with guns differently in this country.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.750
Thank you so much.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.888
Jason.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.309
The woman who killed Luke.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.729
I don't want to talk about it.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.941
I know who she is.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.364
Brooke Mathison,
born February 22, 1977,

09:32.489 --> 09:34.992
Seoul, South Korea, Army brat.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.619
Her father took a Pentagon post
in the early '90s.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.872
All we know is that he was charged
with influence-peddling.

09:40.998 --> 09:43.875
The case was dropped,
but he was dishonorably discharged.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.377
Her life tail-spinned after that.

09:45.502 --> 09:49.464
She left home, but she pops up
in various places throughout the country.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.384
Five years ago... she disappears,

09:52.509 --> 09:55.637
erases any trace of her existence.
It's like she never was.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.516
We know who she is.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.352
What's next?

10:03.145 --> 10:04.646
We know more than who she is.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.398
We know where she is.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.233
Chuck found an address.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.485
I'm going after her myself, off the grid.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.987
But I need backup.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.031
You with me?

10:20.370 --> 10:23.915
<i>When something as simple
as a mandatory background check</i>

10:24.041 --> 10:25.751
<i>can't get through Congress,</i>

10:25.876 --> 10:28.086
<i>then I have to wonder how we got here.</i>

10:28.211 --> 10:31.256
<i>That was First Lady
Alex Kirkman earlier this morning.</i>

10:31.381 --> 10:33.675
<i>Right now, we have
Montana Senator Jack Bowman,</i>

10:33.800 --> 10:35.886
<i>Chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, with us</i>

10:36.011 --> 10:39.097
<i>at the Hart Senate Office Building.
Thanks for joining us, Senator.</i>

10:39.222 --> 10:40.098
<i>Pleasure.</i>

10:40.223 --> 10:42.100
<i>Now, what do you make
of the First Lady's comments?</i>

10:42.225 --> 10:45.854
<i>Well, I have to say, I find it curious
that on the same day the President</i>

10:45.979 --> 10:47.564
<i>announces his hundred days roll-out,</i>

10:47.689 --> 10:50.108
<i>the First Lady starts beating
the drum for gun control.</i>

10:50.233 --> 10:53.612
<i>Who's making policy here? Hmm?
The President or the First Lady?</i>

10:53.737 --> 10:54.613
Emily.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.198
- Hey.
- I have a minor flag.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.283
- Are you talking about the First Lady?
- You heard?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.910
I'm not sure it's so minor.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.203
<i>- ...he's gonna take...</i>
- Mr. President.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.246
<i>I don't know if he's the kind
of president--</i>

11:03.580 --> 11:05.582
What do we know about Jack Bowman?

11:06.041 --> 11:08.919
He's the former Governor of Montana.
He resigned after the Capitol bombing

11:09.044 --> 11:10.921
so his successor
could appoint him to the Senate.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.422
Ambitious.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.257
Highly. His appointment to the Senate

11:14.383 --> 11:17.052
moved up his national timetable
by an election cycle or two.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.639
- Where does he stand on gun control?
- Well, he's from Montana, sir.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.641
Damn it!

11:22.766 --> 11:24.976
I wanted to stay off
of these third-rail issues.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.938
You're gonna have to if you want
to keep your first hundred days alive.

11:28.063 --> 11:31.108
Bowman wants to draw you out, make
a national impression at your expense.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.943
How do we stop him?

11:34.069 --> 11:36.113
You have to talk to the First Lady.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.956
Hey. You all right?

11:46.081 --> 11:48.125
Oh, my God, Tom.
I am so sorry.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.836
I so did not mean
to step on your announcement.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.004
It was an honest mistake.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.673
Hell, it wasn't even a mistake.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.925
I mean, you know I agree with you.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.928
So, what's the problem?
Is it the timing?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.055
Timing, perception...

12:02.806 --> 12:05.517
Gun control is one of the most
polarizing issues in the nation.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.103
I just didn't want
to start out of the gate with it.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.604
What are Seth and Emily saying?

12:09.730 --> 12:13.358
They think the best solution is for you
to publicly walk back your comments.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.277
What does that mean?

12:15.402 --> 12:16.862
- Oh, you mean apologize?
- No.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.990
You just need to make it clear
that you were speaking for yourself,

12:20.115 --> 12:22.492
from your heart, and not on behalf
of the administration.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.788
- You mean take a back seat.
- I wouldn't put it like that.

12:26.913 --> 12:27.956
I know.

12:28.457 --> 12:32.085
Any stupid distraction like this right
now could sideline your whole agenda.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.423
Tell me, how do I... walk it back?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.727
You have nothing to be nervous about.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.897
Hey, you're graduating
from Penn with honors.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.149
You interned at the White House
last summer.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.651
And I have a recommendation
from my brilliant cousin.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.820
Well, we'll see how much that's worth.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.240
Congresswoman Yoshida.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.075
You know, I like that new title.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.328
We've come a long way
since the Hill mailroom, haven't we?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.746
Oh, indeed we have.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.748
So I heard about your resignation.
What happened?

13:09.873 --> 13:12.000
It was all very amicable, believe me.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.669
Congresswoman,
this is my cousin Nadia Espinosa.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.254
- A pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine, ma'am.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.007
Impressive CV for someone your age.
Come on in.

13:21.885 --> 13:26.264
Oh... and if I get you some more of that
special Kona coffee that you like,

13:26.389 --> 13:28.767
will you tell me
the real reason you left?

13:28.892 --> 13:31.061
Maybe. I-I'll think about it.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.687
Okay.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.574
Your girl is a classic sociopath.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.787
Can't wait to get her
into an interrogation room...

13:48.912 --> 13:50.288
see what makes her tick.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.254
What the hell is wrong with you?!

13:57.379 --> 13:59.214
You don't know how to drive, huh?!

13:59.339 --> 14:00.465
- Jason!
- Who sent you?!

14:00.590 --> 14:01.967
- Hey!
- Who do you work for?!

14:02.092 --> 14:03.802
He's just a reckless driver. Let him go!

14:03.927 --> 14:07.347
Get the hell out of here, son of a bitch!

14:08.598 --> 14:10.100
What was that?

14:11.268 --> 14:13.061
Look, I shouldn't have...
I shouldn't have done that.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.063
Okay, I overreacted.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.357
But I'm fine.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.902
No, you're not.
I need a partner, not a loose cannon.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.656
With everything that's going on,
I just thought...

14:24.781 --> 14:26.032
Oh, God.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.913
- I'm good.
- I want to believe you. I do.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.292
But I can't take this chance right now.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.794
We got too much riding on this,
the both of us.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.338
Hannah, I said I'm fine. I'm ready.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.173
Get in the car. I'm taking you home.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.341
What?

14:43.466 --> 14:44.634
Jason, get in the car.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.054
I'll walk.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.973
Ja--

14:59.733 --> 15:01.651
Reschedule that meeting.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.655
Aaron?

15:06.656 --> 15:07.949
Madam Speaker.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.534
What are you doing here?

15:09.659 --> 15:11.536
My cousin has an interview
with the Congresswoman.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.372
Oh, I didn't realize that politics
was a family business.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.874
No, no, it's not.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.043
Can't be easy to be
on the sidelines today.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.794
The President's in very capable hands.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.173
Listen... I hope I didn't have
anything to do with what happened,

15:23.298 --> 15:26.468
- leaking that story to Abe Leonard.
- Yeah, I appreciate that, ma'am.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.386
It's not that simple, but thank you.

15:28.511 --> 15:32.349
I know you and I have locked horns on
occasion, but I've always respected you.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.268
You'll land on your feet.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.313
And if there's anything I can do,
let me know.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.982
- I mean that.
- Thank you, ma'am.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.570
So how'd it go?

15:45.695 --> 15:47.530
- Good. I think.
- Yeah?

15:48.531 --> 15:50.033
Was that Speaker Hookstraten?

16:36.997 --> 16:38.289
<i>Chuck, it's me.</i>

16:38.415 --> 16:39.958
<i>The place is completely cleared out.</i>

16:40.083 --> 16:41.918
<i>I need you to look
into the building records.</i>

16:42.043 --> 16:44.379
<i>Find out who owns the property
and any transaction history.</i>

16:44.504 --> 16:46.423
<i>Hit me back when you've got something.</i>

17:19.873 --> 17:21.332
If it makes you feel any better,

17:21.458 --> 17:24.169
this is actually totally
standard political procedure.

17:24.294 --> 17:27.130
What, pretending to eat crow
on national television

17:27.255 --> 17:29.257
while the rest of the nation's
eating their breakfast?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.843
Think of it this way.
You could be doing late night.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.137
How's it going?

17:34.262 --> 17:35.972
- I'll go see how close they are.
- Okay.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.852
- You look great.
- Tom, I look like a mannequin.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.604
No, you don't. You look beautiful.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.940
Tom, I'm just no good at playing this,
you know, submissive-wife role.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.443
- No one's asking you to.
- Really?

17:48.568 --> 17:51.029
All I ask is that you acknowledge
that the comments were yours

17:51.154 --> 17:52.947
and not that of the administration.
That's it.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.659
They're ready.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.661
Thank you.

17:58.787 --> 17:59.829
Look...

18:00.497 --> 18:03.124
I love you, and I'm gonna do this.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.336
Thank you.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.175
Clearly, you're juggling a lot
as First Lady,

18:13.009 --> 18:15.970
wife, mother, spokesman, role model.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.722
How do you keep it all together?

18:17.847 --> 18:19.474
Um...

18:19.599 --> 18:23.269
I... I have to admit, it has been, uh...

18:23.853 --> 18:26.314
an adjustment
with a steep learning curve.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.568
I mean, just yesterday,
I managed to get in hot water

18:30.693 --> 18:33.113
for a comment I made at a luncheon.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.324
Senator Jack Bowman of Montana
accused you

18:36.449 --> 18:39.869
of soft-pedaling gun control
on behalf of the President.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.162
Is that what you were doing?

18:41.287 --> 18:44.415
I gave a brief speech.
I was not expecting any questions.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.167
And, um...

18:46.292 --> 18:50.755
when asked about gun violence,
I simply spoke my mind.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.549
So there was nothing premeditated?

18:52.674 --> 18:55.677
No, not at all.
I spoke as a citizen, as a mother,

18:55.802 --> 18:57.887
not as a First Lady.

18:58.012 --> 19:03.184
But I have discovered that when you are
married to the President, you, uh...

19:03.309 --> 19:05.728
you don't really get
to make that distinction.

19:05.854 --> 19:09.941
So tackling gun reform is not something
that you want to take on as First Lady.

19:10.066 --> 19:13.528
Right now, I plan on leaving the politics

19:13.653 --> 19:16.322
to the new politician in my family.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.617
And I know that both Tom and I
are very excited

19:19.742 --> 19:22.579
about his agenda
for the first hundred days.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.375
D.C. was designed to intimidate, right?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.461
- It's working.
- Come on. It's only been a day.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.130
You'll hear back from them
any minute now.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.924
I know. I just really want it.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.887
- So, are you ever gonna talk about it?
- About what?

19:39.012 --> 19:41.097
Why you left the White House?

19:41.723 --> 19:43.641
Look, I know you don't do
anything without good reason,

19:43.766 --> 19:46.060
but my mom said you were thinking
about moving back to Texas.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.730
I just want to say,
for the record, it's a really bad idea.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.733
Nadia, I made it about as far
as I can make it in this town.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.612
It was a really good run. Now it's...
It's time to try something new.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.655
- Can I just say one thing?
- Now you're asking?

19:57.780 --> 20:00.658
Before you, no one thought it was possible
to get out of our town.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.286
You probably don't remember this, but...

20:04.120 --> 20:06.414
the summer after
you graduated from college,

20:06.539 --> 20:08.625
I was maybe 10,
and you came home for a visit.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.168
And the only thing you could talk about

20:10.293 --> 20:12.587
was moving to D.C.
to work in the mailroom

20:12.712 --> 20:16.132
of some senator
that nobody had ever heard of.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.300
Yeah.

20:19.302 --> 20:22.472
I'll never forget that you told me it
didn't matter that we came from nothing.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.724
- Look, Nadia, just--
- Because... No, shut up.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.478
You were gonna prove
that even we can make a difference.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.314
That's why you came to D.C.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.734
That's why I'm here.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.320
Because of you.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.793
Okay, that address you went to

20:51.918 --> 20:54.045
has been completely vacant
for the past five years.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.214
- So it's a dead end.
- Not necessarily.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.341
- Someone's still paying the property tax.
- Who?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.343
Browning Reed.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.054
Browning Reed?
The private defense company?

21:03.179 --> 21:05.890
- I thought they went out of business.
- Supposedly, but it hasn't stopped them

21:06.015 --> 21:08.226
from shelling out $35,000 a year
for an empty building.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.061
Nice work, Chuck.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.980
Find out whatever else you can
on Browning Reed,

21:12.105 --> 21:15.149
- and if they own other properties in D.C.
- I'm on it.

21:17.527 --> 21:18.987
Do you smell that?

21:19.654 --> 21:22.198
Yeah, there was a... a gas leak
in the building earlier.

21:22.323 --> 21:25.493
A guy from D.C. United Gas
checked it out and said it was okay.

21:25.827 --> 21:26.744
Chuck.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.372
D.C. United doesn't check gas leaks.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.040
The fire department does.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.128
Out! Now!

22:06.909 --> 22:09.245
- You okay?
- I can't hear anything.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.956
It'll come back. Just breathe.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.917
Hey.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.253
We're okay.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.465
Just a routine gas-leak explosion, right?

22:20.590 --> 22:21.632
Right.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.092
Right.

22:24.177 --> 22:27.680
Listen... they think we're dead so maybe
we have the edge on them for once.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.683
Somehow, that doesn't
make me feel better.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.481
The only connection we have
is Browning Reed.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.983
Did we find out
if they own any other properties?

22:39.108 --> 22:40.610
Thank God for the Cloud.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.990
They own six properties in North Dakota.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.950
- Anything closer?
- Actually, very.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.120
135 Columbia Road, Washington, D.C.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.081
Guess that's where I'm headed next.

22:55.124 --> 22:59.003
Mr. President, my name is Carol.
I'm from Philadelphia.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.422
I'm 74 years old,
and I'm on a fixed income.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.258
I've lived in the same apartment
for 30 years,

23:04.384 --> 23:05.510
and because of gentrification,

23:05.635 --> 23:08.012
I can't afford to live
in my neighborhood anymore.

23:08.137 --> 23:11.307
How are you going to help people like me
from getting pushed out of our homes?

23:11.432 --> 23:13.935
Carol, thank you for asking the question.
You're absolutely right.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.187
Recent studies have shown
that housing prices

23:16.312 --> 23:18.356
have gone up exponentially
over the last three years,

23:18.481 --> 23:21.818
- especially in our major cities.
- I'm sorry, sir. Can I stop you there?

23:21.943 --> 23:23.903
Emily, tell me whatever you want,
but if you don't start

23:24.028 --> 23:26.614
talking to me like a person instead
of the President of the United States,

23:26.739 --> 23:28.366
- we're never gonna get through this.
- Okay.

23:28.491 --> 23:29.992
You're falling into professor mode again.

23:30.118 --> 23:33.830
Carol from Philadelphia doesn't give
a damn about academic surveys.

23:33.955 --> 23:37.667
She cares that she has to take two buses
to find an affordable grocery store.

23:37.792 --> 23:40.002
And she wants to know
that you care about that, too.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.171
I do, which is why
I was referencing this study,

23:42.296 --> 23:44.340
because it shows
that with specific zoning laws

23:44.465 --> 23:46.676
and small-business incentives,
local grocers can--

23:46.801 --> 23:49.178
No offense, sir, but I just fell asleep.

23:49.303 --> 23:52.056
Look, you have the right answers,

23:52.181 --> 23:54.642
but tonight is about listening
to people's concerns.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.228
- Focus on relating.
- No, I don't feel comfortable with that.

23:57.353 --> 24:01.107
- The town hall isn't about me.
- With all due respect, sir, yes, it is.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.944
Okay.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.488
You want me to show that I have a grasp

24:07.613 --> 24:10.408
on all of the topics,
but not sound too professorial.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.952
Yes... and personalize every answer.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.414
And personalize every answer.
Anything else?

24:16.539 --> 24:20.209
If you can get through tonight unscathed,
we can get to policy building.

24:21.002 --> 24:22.128
Okay.

24:23.212 --> 24:26.883
This next question falls under
the category of "expect the unexpected."

24:27.008 --> 24:29.760
Mr. President, thanks to the Internet,

24:29.886 --> 24:33.389
pornography addiction has become
a big problem in my community.

24:33.514 --> 24:38.019
What are your thoughts on pornography,
and how will you help with this problem?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.065
You want me to personalize this one?

24:46.235 --> 24:48.905
President Kirkman begins
his town hall in just a few minutes.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.239
What can we expect?

24:50.364 --> 24:51.949
Well, it's his first public appearance

24:52.074 --> 24:54.410
away from the White House setting,
and the idea is

24:54.535 --> 24:56.954
to bring <i>his</i> agenda
directly to the people,

24:57.079 --> 24:59.373
<i>to showcase the more
personal side of Tom Kirkman.</i>

24:59.499 --> 25:01.751
<i>And I'm eager to see
if he can pull it off.</i>

25:04.837 --> 25:06.088
Thank you.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.299
Mr. President.

25:08.424 --> 25:10.801
My name is Melissa,
and I wanted to ask

25:10.927 --> 25:13.137
what was it like
becoming a president overnight?

25:13.262 --> 25:16.265
That's a very difficult question
for me to answer.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.976
Over a thousand people died that evening,

25:19.101 --> 25:20.895
many of whom I knew.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.564
Some I had talked to just that afternoon.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.484
But if I'm gonna be completely honest...

25:26.609 --> 25:28.861
it was the scariest moment of my life.

25:29.612 --> 25:33.658
But I knew I wanted to serve my country,
and that's what I did.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.993
And I'm committed to doing
the best job possible.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.162
Mr. President, we were all so worried

25:38.287 --> 25:39.830
about you after you were shot.

25:39.956 --> 25:44.335
I'm surprised and elated
to see you out and around so quickly.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.419
How are you feeling?

25:45.545 --> 25:47.964
Thank you.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.508
Thank you all.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.009
Thank you very much.

25:52.134 --> 25:54.804
I'm feeling much better.
It only hurts when I breathe.

25:54.929 --> 25:57.974
Seriously...

25:58.099 --> 26:00.518
I feel lucky, grateful.

26:00.643 --> 26:03.104
Hello, Mr. President, my name is Amy.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.356
And my question to you, sir, is,

26:05.481 --> 26:08.526
after all that's happened
these past few months,

26:08.651 --> 26:12.863
what do I tell my children?
Are we ever gonna be safe again?

26:12.989 --> 26:14.865
That's a very important question, Amy.

26:14.991 --> 26:17.868
If you don't mind, what are the names
of your children?

26:17.994 --> 26:19.370
Oh, Lily and Sara.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.538
Lily and Sara.

26:20.663 --> 26:23.624
I had a difficult time
explaining this to my kids, too.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.127
But I think you have to be honest
with Lily and Sara

26:26.252 --> 26:27.878
and acknowledge what's happened.

26:28.004 --> 26:31.340
And tell them that we're gonna
get through this... together.

26:31.674 --> 26:34.260
And when we do,
we'll be better and stronger for it.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.639
Mr. President,
I was a factory worker for 27 years

26:38.764 --> 26:40.558
before the plant closed down last year.

26:40.683 --> 26:45.062
I'm 54 years old, and I don't think
I have it in me to start a new career.

26:45.187 --> 26:48.149
How you gonna bring back jobs
like mine to Virginia?

26:49.775 --> 26:51.527
What kind of factory did you work in?

26:51.652 --> 26:55.364
I was an assembly-line foreman
for a small-appliance manufacturer.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.910
My father and grandfather
were both factory workers.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.705
I remember
when I was a boy that...

27:08.377 --> 27:10.463
I'm not here to speak about me.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.883
I'm here to speak about you.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.887
I'm very sorry
that you lost your job, sir.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.264
But as to what I can do
to help bring it back,

27:20.389 --> 27:22.391
the answer is nothing.

27:22.516 --> 27:24.143
It's gone... for good.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.938
And if some politician told you
otherwise, they were lying to you.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.899
And I won't do that.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.943
<i>Now, the reason why jobs like yours
have disappeared</i>

27:33.069 --> 27:36.364
<i>isn't just because of cheaper labor
in some other country.</i>

27:36.489 --> 27:38.449
<i>Primarily, it's technology.</i>

27:38.574 --> 27:42.036
<i>Technology allows one person
to do what used to take 10.</i>

27:42.161 --> 27:44.789
<i>Now, that might be great
for the economy,</i>

27:44.914 --> 27:47.792
<i>but it's not for you...
for your family.</i>

27:47.917 --> 27:49.627
<i>Now, a moment ago,
Melissa asked me</i>

27:49.752 --> 27:51.921
<i>what it was like
to become president overnight,</i>

27:52.046 --> 27:54.465
<i>and I told her it was
the scariest moment of my life.</i>

27:54.590 --> 27:57.093
It doesn't even compare
to what you're going through, sir:

27:57.218 --> 27:59.804
the fear of not knowing
if you can provide for your family.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.972
Not since the Industrial Revolution

28:02.098 --> 28:05.309
has our economy gone through
such a dynamic transformation.

28:05.434 --> 28:08.688
We need solutions.
So here's what we're gonna do.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.108
We're gonna create
a public-works program

28:12.233 --> 28:15.403
that's gonna deal with the failing
infrastructure issues around the country,

28:15.528 --> 28:19.990
and anyone who has lost
a manual-labor manufacturing job

28:20.116 --> 28:23.828
in the last four years
because of this changing economy,

28:23.953 --> 28:27.164
their names will go to the top
of the list for these new jobs.

28:27.289 --> 28:29.166
But I also want to create programs

28:29.291 --> 28:32.169
at every public college
and university across the country

28:32.294 --> 28:34.964
so unemployed workers
can become educated

28:35.089 --> 28:37.174
in these new and emerging technologies.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.177
And I want you to know that I believe

28:40.302 --> 28:42.346
that the American government
has a responsibility,

28:42.471 --> 28:44.348
not just to maintain,

28:44.473 --> 28:46.851
but create opportunities
for the American people,

28:46.976 --> 28:48.811
and that's what we're going to do.

28:51.897 --> 28:52.898
Thank you.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.820
Next question, please.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.324
Hello, Mr. President.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.368
- My name is Sandra.
- Hi, Sandra.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.037
I heard what the First Lady said
about background checks,

29:07.163 --> 29:08.414
and I have a question.

29:09.665 --> 29:13.127
I recently lost my daughter, Julie.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.838
My ex-boyfriend was...

29:16.255 --> 29:19.884
released from jail, and even so,

29:20.009 --> 29:24.013
he was able to buy a handgun
from a private seller.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.682
He broke into our house...

29:28.476 --> 29:30.352
and he shot and killed my little girl.

29:32.021 --> 29:33.814
I'm so sorry.

29:33.939 --> 29:38.027
My daughter was my world,
my everything.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.363
And the man...

29:41.697 --> 29:44.992
...who took her from me
was a monster who somehow

29:45.117 --> 29:48.412
still got his hands on a gun

29:48.537 --> 29:50.414
because unlicensed gun dealers

29:50.539 --> 29:52.541
don't have to run background checks.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.087
I'm here because I have to be strong

29:57.213 --> 29:59.340
for my other two daughters.

30:00.883 --> 30:05.638
But I struggle every day
to find a reason to keep going.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.893
I would like to ask you, Mr. President...

30:12.895 --> 30:16.732
...what will you do to prevent
something like this from happening again?

30:32.873 --> 30:35.501
Sandra, your story breaks my heart.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.921
<i>And as a father,</i>

30:39.046 --> 30:41.131
<i>I can't even imagine
what you're going through.</i>

30:41.257 --> 30:43.926
<i>Gun control is one of the most divisive,</i>

30:44.051 --> 30:46.136
<i>hot-button topics in our nation,</i>

30:46.262 --> 30:50.057
<i>but that should not be an excuse
for avoiding the issue.</i>

30:50.182 --> 30:51.809
<i>In fact, that should be the opposite.</i>

30:51.934 --> 30:55.646
- He's good.
- Yeah, that's because he means it.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.481
<i>But I want to be absolutely clear.</i>

30:57.606 --> 31:01.402
<i>I believe that the American people
have every right to buy and own guns</i>

31:01.527 --> 31:03.487
<i>by virtue of the second amendment.</i>

31:03.612 --> 31:05.322
I would also like to take a moment

31:05.447 --> 31:08.576
to quash the myth
that somehow gun control

31:08.701 --> 31:10.494
is equal to the Federal Government

31:10.619 --> 31:12.830
coming into your home
and taking your weapons away.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.457
<i>Nobody is advocating for that.</i>

31:16.041 --> 31:17.918
<i>We need to be doing everything we can</i>

31:18.043 --> 31:21.338
<i>to stop guns from falling
into the hands of prior felons,</i>

31:21.463 --> 31:23.257
people dealing
with serious mental-health issues,

31:23.382 --> 31:26.010
people on terrorist watch lists.

31:26.135 --> 31:27.636
I mean, come on.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.139
We need to be using common sense.

31:30.264 --> 31:31.807
It's as simple as that.

31:32.141 --> 31:35.185
And I hate the fact that there is
nothing I can say or do right now

31:35.311 --> 31:37.229
to ease Sandra's pain,

31:37.771 --> 31:40.107
but I can make her one promise;

31:40.566 --> 31:43.110
that I will do everything in my power

31:43.235 --> 31:46.238
to make sure that
not one more American family

31:46.739 --> 31:48.657
has to experience her grief.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.119
Thank you.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.170
Thank you.

32:10.638 --> 32:13.015
- Yes.
<i>- Aaron Shore is here to see you.</i>

32:14.683 --> 32:17.102
Send him in.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.480
- Madam Speaker.
- Aaron.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.941
- Thank you for seeing me.
- Please.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.235
- Thanks.
- So, what can I do for you?

32:25.361 --> 32:27.071
I wanted to take you up on your offer.

32:27.196 --> 32:28.697
You're good friends
with Tony Buchanan, right?

32:28.822 --> 32:30.240
I am. Why?

32:30.366 --> 32:32.701
I was wondering
if you could make an introduction.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.871
You want to work
for Buchanan and Associates?

32:35.996 --> 32:38.582
I've... I've always thought they're some
of the strongest lobbyists in town.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.918
I like the causes they represent,

32:41.043 --> 32:43.379
their public-interest concerns,
their non-profits.

32:43.504 --> 32:45.381
Why do you want to be a lobbyist?

32:46.548 --> 32:50.386
Well, when you leave a high White House
position under a cloud, well,

32:50.511 --> 32:51.929
let's say your options
are somewhat limited.

32:52.054 --> 32:55.015
You didn't leave under a cloud.
I mean, I'll admit,

32:55.140 --> 32:59.645
it's a little mysterious, but there's
no hint of scandal... is there?

33:00.729 --> 33:02.731
No.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.192
Okay, then.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.236
Wouldn't you rather be on the inside?

33:07.361 --> 33:10.114
Yeah, but lobbying seems like
a pretty good temp job.

33:10.239 --> 33:12.074
Besides, the money wouldn't hurt.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.617
That's the problem.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.245
Once you get used to that expense
account, it's hard to go back.

33:16.370 --> 33:17.746
Yeah.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.374
Washington needs you on the inside.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.501
You're too talented to leave.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.629
Look, um, I appreciate that, ma'am,

33:25.754 --> 33:28.757
but, um... can you think
of any other alternatives?

33:32.261 --> 33:33.804
Yeah.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.222
Work for me.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.062
Everybody, come on in.

33:44.898 --> 33:47.067
That's it. Come on in.
Please take a seat.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.821
I want to thank you all
for being here today.

33:50.946 --> 33:54.116
Last night, I spoke
to specific policy and ideas,

33:54.241 --> 33:58.287
but I want you to know I am still trying
to determine my own priorities.

33:58.412 --> 34:01.832
So any input that you have,
I would be grateful for.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.293
There seem to be
a few political pundits out there

34:04.418 --> 34:06.670
that think that I am working
at a distinct disadvantage

34:06.795 --> 34:09.339
because I am registered
as an Independent.

34:09.465 --> 34:12.009
I can't tell you how strongly
I disagree with that.

34:12.134 --> 34:15.679
I believe that if we work together,
we can create a bi-partisan platform

34:15.804 --> 34:17.848
that would be beneficial to both parties,

34:17.973 --> 34:21.435
and as an Independent,
I can help facilitate that.

34:21.560 --> 34:25.688
We have an opportunity to bypass
special interests, lobbyists,

34:25.813 --> 34:30.319
and use... compassion,
cooperation, common sense.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.862
Now...

34:31.987 --> 34:33.697
I'm not as naive

34:33.822 --> 34:35.949
as some of you would like to believe.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.034
And I'm not trying to minimize
or over-simplify

34:38.159 --> 34:41.871
the incredible challenges
that we will face.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.541
But as we begin our work here today,

34:44.666 --> 34:48.879
I would like us to move toward
the true spirit of partnership.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.715
Now, having said that, I'll go first.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.842
Senator Bowman... you and I have

34:53.967 --> 34:55.969
very different opinions on gun safety.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.724
I would like to make a pledge to you,
sir, that I will work tirelessly with you

35:00.849 --> 35:04.061
until we reach a consensus,
something that we both can live with,

35:04.186 --> 35:05.854
maybe even be proud of.

35:07.272 --> 35:10.317
Mr. President, you can rely on me to act
in the best interests of the country.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.944
Thank you, sir.

35:12.528 --> 35:14.238
We had an amicable first meeting.

35:14.363 --> 35:17.908
The President has some
big ideas for the future, and so do we.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.661
Now, the President made it clear
last night and again today

35:20.786 --> 35:22.538
that gun control's
an important issue to him.

35:22.663 --> 35:24.748
We don't happen to see
eye-to-eye on the topic,

35:24.873 --> 35:27.251
but in an effort to bring
the issue out into the open,

35:27.376 --> 35:29.253
as the Chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Committee,

35:29.378 --> 35:32.756
I will be re-introducing Bill 8180
from the former Congress,

35:32.881 --> 35:34.758
which strengthens
federal background checks.

35:34.883 --> 35:38.762
Now, I happen to oppose this bill, but
in the spirit of bipartisan discussion,

35:38.887 --> 35:41.056
<i>I'd like to put it
before the Senate for debate.</i>

35:41.181 --> 35:44.101
- Do you believe this guy?
- Son of a bitch.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.519
We can't introduce our own bill now.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.771
We do that, and we look like
we're competing against Congress

35:47.896 --> 35:49.064
instead of working with them.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.607
He hasn't even left
the White House grounds.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.276
Already he's hijacking our agenda.

35:52.401 --> 35:55.070
<i>If the President's gonna find
a compromise, it comes at a price.</i>

35:55.195 --> 35:57.114
Good. Get that to me
within the hour, please.

35:57.239 --> 35:58.282
Yes, ma'am.

35:58.407 --> 36:00.617
Okay, do we have anyone
who can propose amendments?

36:00.742 --> 36:03.328
Because this bill has loopholes
you could fly a plane through.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.372
Mr. President, we're trying
to figure out how to handle

36:05.497 --> 36:07.541
- this development with Bowman.
- I just read the bill.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.585
I can see why it didn't get
out of committee.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.461
The problem is,
if you don't support the bill,

36:11.587 --> 36:13.630
you'll be branded a hypocrite
who used the town hall

36:13.755 --> 36:15.883
for political purposes
when you're really soft on guns.

36:16.008 --> 36:18.135
But if you do support it,
you're opening yourself up

36:18.260 --> 36:20.929
to all sorts of criticism
because of its flawed wording.

36:21.054 --> 36:23.765
Son of a bitch is trying
to back us into a corner.

36:24.099 --> 36:25.767
Get ready for a fight.

36:50.626 --> 36:52.502
How long you been following me?

36:52.628 --> 36:54.213
Since the explosion.

36:55.297 --> 36:56.840
You okay?

36:56.965 --> 36:58.091
Yeah.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.469
I'm ready now.

37:01.136 --> 37:02.471
Let's go.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.816
Browning Reed owns this place?

37:14.942 --> 37:16.652
According to what Chuck found out.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.883
Let her go.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.135
Let her go!

39:07.929 --> 39:09.931
Put your hands behind your head.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.809
Put your hands behind your head!

39:12.934 --> 39:14.936
Oh, Jason Atwood.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.481
It's been a while.

39:17.606 --> 39:18.815
Jason.

39:18.940 --> 39:19.983
Jason, put your gun down.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.985
Go get the car.
I'll bring her out front.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.905
Yeah, Jason!
Let the real cop take it from here.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.574
- Shut the hell up.
- Don't let her manipulate you again.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.910
Jason, we'll make her pay
for what she did, okay?

39:31.244 --> 39:32.287
Do it.

39:33.246 --> 39:33.997
Do it!

39:34.122 --> 39:35.832
Damn it, Atwood! We need her alive!

39:35.957 --> 39:37.626
Aah!

39:44.800 --> 39:46.218
Let's take her in.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.666
Thank you.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.298
- Aaron.
- Hey.

40:25.424 --> 40:26.716
Hey, what are you doing here?

40:26.842 --> 40:30.512
I'm meeting with Gary over at
Lege Affairs. It'll hit playbook tomorrow.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.722
I'm the new Chief Strategist
for the Speaker of the House.

40:32.848 --> 40:34.724
You're working
for Kimble Hookstraten?

40:34.850 --> 40:37.144
I know, it seems a little
outside the box.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.729
A little? She's the head
of the Republican Party,

40:39.855 --> 40:41.064
and you're a card-carrying Democrat.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.858
I'm looking to redefine
the playing field.

40:42.983 --> 40:45.735
I thought a lot about it,
and with Kirkman as president,

40:45.861 --> 40:48.864
the party lines don't seem to mean
as much as they used to, you know?

40:48.989 --> 40:50.115
Hmm.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.703
Well, I have a meeting with State.
I guess I'll be seeing you.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.621
- I guess so.
- Good.

41:02.377 --> 41:03.795
Thank you.

41:14.055 --> 41:16.057
- Surprise!
- Daddy!

41:19.311 --> 41:22.105
- I didn't know you were coming.
- That's why they call it a surprise.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.107
- Is that from Zeno's?
- Pepperoni and a veggie.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.734
Awesome.

41:25.859 --> 41:26.776
Wait up.

41:26.902 --> 41:29.279
- This really is such a nice surprise.
- Hi.

41:29.404 --> 41:30.447
They needed to see you.

41:30.572 --> 41:32.449
No more than I needed
to see all of you.

41:32.574 --> 41:36.286
- Long day.
- I know, I saw Bowman on TV.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.872
Perfect example of why I never
wanted to get into politics.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.292
- And yet here we are.
- Yeah.

41:42.417 --> 41:43.418
Fighting the good fight.

41:43.543 --> 41:44.961
We'll see.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.755
You better not have eaten it all.

42:17.244 --> 42:18.954
Oh, my God.
