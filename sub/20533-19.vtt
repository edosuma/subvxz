Previously on 90210:
I like you, Silver,

00:03.504 --> 00:05.756
and I'm pretty sure
you like me, too.

00:05.798 --> 00:07.424
I could have done something
to really hurt you.

00:07.466 --> 00:08.926
You can date Mark
if you want,

00:08.968 --> 00:10.135
but we're done.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.095
NAVID: Sorry about Silver.
I know it hurts,

00:12.137 --> 00:14.515
but you got me.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.433
I really like you.
I like you, too.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.853
I'm afraid that when I tell
you the truth

00:18.894 --> 00:20.562
about my family,
you may not want

00:20.604 --> 00:22.063
to be involved with me.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.190
Why would you lie to me?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.984
'Cause she wants
my inheritance.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.109
She used you.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.361
Liam, I'm sorry,

00:27.402 --> 00:30.071
but I had a lot of
money on the line.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.740
AMANDA:
Welcome to Armitage Books.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.575
Your blog has a real shot

00:33.617 --> 00:34.994
of finding the audience
that it deserves.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.913
I'm Author X,
and I'm done hiding.
What?

00:37.955 --> 00:39.999
How did you think you were
gonna get away with this?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.334
If you would just
let me explain.
Explain what?!

00:42.376 --> 00:44.252
How you wrote about me?
How you used me

00:44.294 --> 00:46.129
like every other woman I've ever
been involved with?

00:46.171 --> 00:47.798
You're messing with real
people's lives here.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.925
Patrick?

00:49.967 --> 00:52.093
We need to talk.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.304
(sighs)

00:55.389 --> 00:56.682
(sighs)

00:56.724 --> 00:57.892
What are you doing here?

00:57.933 --> 00:59.601
Gee, Annabelle, I don't know.

00:59.643 --> 01:02.270
Maybe it has something to do
with your little book

01:02.312 --> 01:03.772
about a naive Beverly Hills girl

01:03.814 --> 01:05.482
who mistakes sex for love

01:05.524 --> 01:07.317
and sells herself
to the villainous "Patterson."

01:07.359 --> 01:09.528
It's not bad for a hooker,
heart of gold and all.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.487
Screw you, Patrick.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.113
Oh, we're way past screwing.

01:12.155 --> 01:15.200
Nancy O'Dell just tweeted
that Author X will be revealed

01:15.242 --> 01:17.828
on her special in two days.
I won't let that happen.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.121
Well, it's my decision.
It's not about you.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.456
You can't be
that stupid.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.124
The entire country is on
a witch hunt

01:23.166 --> 01:25.293
for Patterson's real identity,
and I didn't exactly

01:25.335 --> 01:26.378
cover my tracks with you.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.171
My wife cannot find out
about this.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.965
You're married?
Yes.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.216
And your tell-all is

01:31.258 --> 01:33.385
the next read
for my wife's book club.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.554
If you come out, I'm guaranteed
a very expensive divorce.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.223
You spent $10,000
on one night with me.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.474
I think you'll manage.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.143
You will cancel the interview.

01:42.185 --> 01:46.732
Because if you hurt my family,
I'll come after yours.

01:57.076 --> 01:59.703
You like me and I like you.
I don't see

01:59.745 --> 02:01.329
how family's an issue.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.750
It's mostly my mother.
(chuckles) She has a real knack

02:04.792 --> 02:06.460
for derailing
my romantic relationships.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.211
The woman makes Jaws
seem cuddly.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.838
I'm not afraid
to swim with sharks.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.716
Yeah, well, you haven't met
my mother. She's a judge,

02:12.758 --> 02:14.342
one of the most respected
in the country,

02:14.384 --> 02:16.261
and just found out
that she's being considered

02:16.303 --> 02:17.972
to be the next
secretary of state.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.598
Like, of the United
States of America?

02:19.640 --> 02:23.102
Yeah, that's the one.
I mean, she's a pro at
scrutinizing people,

02:23.143 --> 02:24.979
and overly focused on
our family image. It...

02:25.020 --> 02:28.315
So you don't want to give you
and me a chance

02:28.356 --> 02:30.901
because you don't think
I can handle your mother?

02:30.943 --> 02:32.778
No, Naomi...

02:32.820 --> 02:35.823
I just know how grueling
it can be to be a bug

02:35.864 --> 02:37.198
under my mother's
magnifying glass.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.035
And I feel I should just
give you fair warning.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.830
Now, look, I gotta head back
East for some boring

02:42.871 --> 02:44.539
family fund-raiser,
and while I'm gone,

02:44.581 --> 02:47.542
just-just think about whether
or not this is a challenge

02:47.584 --> 02:49.294
you want to take on.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.839

time to talk about it now.

03:25.164 --> 03:28.542
Okay, um, you go out there
and distract him,

03:28.583 --> 03:30.836
and then I'll sneak out.
Yeah.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.257
Hey, man, you busy?

03:36.299 --> 03:37.342
Me? No.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.594
Unless you call sleeping,
all alone, busy.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.888
You're up early.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.641
Yeah, I didn't want to be there
when Annie got up.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.686
Between Vanessa and Ashley and
Sydney, and now Annie's book,

03:47.728 --> 03:50.898
I just feel like I'm being
used by women at every turn.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.566
Yeah, you've had
a rough run lately.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.234
Yeah, well, so have you.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.319
But, you know,
we can either be down

03:56.361 --> 04:00.532
and depressed about it
and make a spiral of our
past mistakes

04:00.574 --> 04:03.326
or we can focus on
the surfboard company.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.787
So, I've been
thinking about how

04:05.829 --> 04:09.708
every major sport brand has a
face to represent their company.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.709
Well, fortunately for us,

04:10.751 --> 04:12.335
we already have a famous face:
yours.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.088
No, I've been burned by

04:14.129 --> 04:16.548
the celebrity thing
way too many times.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.675
So...

04:21.095 --> 04:22.637
Meet Cassie McCoy.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.890
She's already
shattering records
all over the world.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.391
Now, I talked
to her manager,

04:26.433 --> 04:28.977
and she's "in between" sponsors
right now.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.939
I can put in half the money with
the residuals from my movies

04:31.980 --> 04:33.857
if you can put in
the other half.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.610
Wow. I haven't seen you
this excited

04:36.651 --> 04:38.445
about anything in... ever.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.529
Come on.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.698
Hey, man, the money is
not an issue. I'm in.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.201
Yeah?
Yeah, I can set up
the meeting and you could

04:44.243 --> 04:46.286
get ready to woo her
with your fancy surfer talk.

04:46.327 --> 04:47.913
Ah! Ha-ha!

04:47.955 --> 04:51.041
Yeah! You're, like,
totally on, brah.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.376
Yeah, I know.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.381
Hey, Dixon, do you want
to come do some

04:58.423 --> 05:01.384
totally off-the-chain,
maternity-wear shopping
with us.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.552
Man, there's nothing

05:02.594 --> 05:04.554
in the world that I would
rather do, honestly,

05:04.596 --> 05:09.143
but, uh, Annie just texted me
and told me to come over ASAP.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.393
Next time. Have fun.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.853
Hey, Silver, um, before we go,

05:11.895 --> 05:14.022
there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

05:14.064 --> 05:14.815
Okay.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.191
I know that we all agreed

05:16.233 --> 05:17.651
I would put
the performing on hold

05:17.692 --> 05:20.154
till after the baby was born,
and before you get all,

05:20.195 --> 05:22.990
"No way," please,
just hear me out.
Okay.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.492
I read about this upcoming
tribute concert

05:25.533 --> 05:27.995
for Spencer Blane.
It's gonna be on TV,

05:28.036 --> 05:29.913
and they're looking for

05:29.955 --> 05:31.414
an undiscovered
singer/songwriter to perform.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.251
Spencer Blane?
That's fricking huge.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.961
Yeah. I know
it's a long shot.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.172
I only have two days to write
a song and submit a demo,

05:38.213 --> 05:40.841
but I want to try.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.926
And Dixon totally has my back
on this,

05:42.968 --> 05:46.180
so I'm gonna let you guys
just talk about it.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.889
(softly):
Thank you.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.433
After losing Ade
as my best friend,

05:50.475 --> 05:52.894
the last thing I want to do is
upset Michaela again.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.522
Being bad cop all the time
really sucks, man.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.732
Why did you tell her
this was a good idea?

05:57.774 --> 06:01.153
I didn't know about
this, all right?

06:01.195 --> 06:04.614
But actually, I don't see
any harm in her trying.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.490
What?

06:05.532 --> 06:06.950
Look, it's just a song.

06:06.992 --> 06:10.912
One song that she has to write
and record in two days?

06:10.954 --> 06:13.248
Let Spencer Blane be the bad cop
when he rejects her.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.251
It would be nice to say yes
for once.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.212
This may be your chance.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.462
Good luck.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.966
Michaela?

06:24.425 --> 06:26.094
Um, don't worry
about the shopping.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.595
Go ahead, write your song.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.557
Silver, thank you so much!

06:30.598 --> 06:32.642
Yeah!
Thank you!

06:34.477 --> 06:36.646
Good cop definitely feels
better.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.736
Yo, yo!
(chuckles)

06:42.777 --> 06:44.487
Uh, I got your message.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.073
You know, if you wanted to talk,

06:46.114 --> 06:49.117
that texting machine you have
also works as a phone, right?

06:49.159 --> 06:50.911
I needed to talk to you
in person.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.080
Okay, now you're scaring me.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.085
Okay, uh...

06:58.126 --> 07:00.295
remember last year

07:00.337 --> 07:02.714
when you asked how
I paid for your rehab?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.465
Yeah, you said you got
your inheritance.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.343
I hadn't yet.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.595
I'm not proud of

07:08.636 --> 07:09.888
how I earned that money.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.682
And it's taken me
a really long time

07:12.724 --> 07:15.435
to figure out how
to tell you about this.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.357
When Patrick and I were dating,

07:20.399 --> 07:23.526
we weren't in
a normal relationship.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.739
I was his escort.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.950
I got paid

07:29.991 --> 07:33.453
to... be with him.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.081
Escort?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.375
Like a hooker?

07:38.417 --> 07:40.210
It didn't start like that.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.003
As soon as I could,

07:42.045 --> 07:45.632
I got out.
And I wrote this book about

07:45.673 --> 07:48.051
the whole awful
situation,

07:48.093 --> 07:49.594
and I know it sounds
really cliché,

07:49.636 --> 07:52.472
but telling the truth
finally set me free
of it all.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.475
Then Patrick showed up
yesterday.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.311
Whoa, whoa. He was here?

07:57.352 --> 07:59.562
Yeah.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.441
I'm supposed to go on
national TV tomorrow

08:02.482 --> 08:05.110
to be revealed
as the book's author.

08:05.152 --> 08:09.697
And he came to say that
if I revealed myself,

08:09.739 --> 08:11.783
his wife would find out.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.452
And if I didn't keep quiet,

08:13.493 --> 08:18.081
he was going to do
something to you.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.792
So I just need you to know.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.338

you have to understand.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.720
Oh, hey, Michaela.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.765
Hey. Sorry to just show up like
this, but I need your help.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.809
I have to write my first song
in a day. Yeah, crazy, right?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.437
Yeah. It took me a week

10:03.478 --> 10:06.064
to write just the chorus to my
first song. What's it about?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.275
Pathetic schoolgirl
as it sounds,

10:08.316 --> 10:10.068
I have a crush on a guy.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.237
Hey, we've all been there.
I know you're

10:12.279 --> 10:14.448
retired from music, but is there
any chance you could help me?

10:14.489 --> 10:16.032
Yeah, it'd be nice
to have something

10:16.074 --> 10:17.700
to keep me busy
and out of trouble.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.328
So, yeah, let's write
a song together.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.247
Ade, thank you.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.958
But let's not
tell Silver, okay?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.334
Just so things don't get weird?

10:26.376 --> 10:28.920
You know what?
I don't care what Silver thinks.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.671
We're not exactly speaking
right now.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.841
Yeah, I know,
but your involvement might make

10:33.883 --> 10:35.760
things tricky
between me and her,

10:35.802 --> 10:38.138
and then she could call off
the entire contest.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.389
She kinda gets to make the rules

10:39.431 --> 10:40.557
since I'm her baby oven.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.602
Yeah, I get it.
I won't mention it to anyone

10:43.643 --> 10:45.312
that we're working on this
together.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.021
Thank you.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.024
Can I see what you got?
Yes, please.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.777
So Liam's modest,
but he's quite the ace surfer.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.197
And surfboards tailor-made
for women was his brainchild.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.617
So you slapped some pink paint
on a board?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.910
How cute. My boards are
already made custom-made for me.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.954
Yeah, but you're Cassie McCoy.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.831
Most girls don't have
boards customized

11:04.872 --> 11:07.626
for their height, weight, skill
level, surfing environment.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.461
They're forced
to buy boards built

11:09.503 --> 11:10.837
with a guy's frame in mind.

11:10.878 --> 11:14.048
If you say, "It's a man's
world," I'm gonna barf.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.385
Well, actually, we're more
of a "Who runs the world?

11:17.427 --> 11:18.761
Girls!" kind of company.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.098
You know, I have major league
companies trying

11:22.140 --> 11:23.891
to woo me with
free crap all the time,

11:23.933 --> 11:25.101
and the only thing
you've gifted is gab.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.145
Liam built
a custom board for you.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.105
Just give it a spin.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.482
Yeah, yeah, we
will do anything

11:30.524 --> 11:32.859
to prove that we are the
company to sponsor you.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.068
You'll do anything?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.111
Yeah, anything.
Anything.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.364
Fine, I want
a private concert here

11:37.405 --> 11:38.657
tomorrow with Olly Murs.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.241
Olly Murs?

11:40.283 --> 11:41.742
British pop star? (laughs)

11:41.784 --> 11:43.286
I'm his number one fan.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.703
You pull Olly Murs
out of your hat,

11:44.745 --> 11:46.164
and I'll give you
the time of day.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.543
Ah...

11:50.669 --> 11:53.004
Oh.
Yeah, we-we're dead.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.465
(recording):
Hey, this is Dixon.
Leave a message.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.884
Dixon, it's me... again.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.093
Please call me back.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.137
I'm supposed to leave
in a couple hours on a plane

12:01.179 --> 12:04.432
to New York for this interview,
and I don't know what to do.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.685
Should I do this or not?

12:06.725 --> 12:08.436
(groans)

12:08.478 --> 12:09.479
Oh, good God.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.438
Throw that ticket away.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.315
Honey, we do not
fly commercial. Ew.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.650
Hey, sis?

12:13.692 --> 12:15.026
Sis.
Hello, brother.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.403
I just got off the phone
with Jordan.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.113
I'm going to New York City
and I'm taking you with me.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.199
Pass. I have plans.
I know, with Silver.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.034
I took care of it--
she's coming, too.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.537
Don't fight-- you'll lose.
Unfortunately,
that's true.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.997
Thank you, Annie.
The thing is

12:28.039 --> 12:30.208
Jordan's mother's hosting
some elaborate yawn-a-thon

12:30.250 --> 12:32.960
where families auction
their heirlooms to help

12:33.002 --> 12:34.795
benefit New York's
"heirloom" buildings.

12:34.837 --> 12:35.922
Heirlooms for heirlooms.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.132
We're going to attend
to show her

12:38.174 --> 12:39.884
how respectable
the Clark family is.

12:39.926 --> 12:43.388
Or, and crazy thought, you could
not care what his mom thinks.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.099
Mark, Jordan is amazing,
and nobody loves

12:46.140 --> 12:47.559
a challenge more than me.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.935
Would you move it--
the jet is standing by.

12:48.976 --> 12:49.977
You're coming, too,

12:50.019 --> 12:51.354
for your fabulous interview.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.522
We're gonna have so much fun.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.607
Oh, yeah, that's me.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.149
A whole barrel of fun.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.069
Look, Dixon's really upset
about what I told him.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.153
Don't be a weepy Wilson.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.530
You knew Dixon wasn't
gonna jump for joy.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.741
Which is even more reason
not to go public

13:02.781 --> 13:04.409
unless he's okay with it.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.160
Um, not necessarily.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.996
Annie, you can still
come out as Author X.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.208
You just have to tell
Nancy O'Dell that...

13:12.250 --> 13:13.834
it's not a true-true story.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.379
Meaning, that you were
inspired by real events,

13:16.421 --> 13:18.548
but the characters in your book
are a mishmosh

13:18.590 --> 13:19.924
of every person you've
ever met in your life.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.343
That way, you won't humiliate
or hurt Dixon any further.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.513
Well, your idea sounds
like a way better plan

13:25.555 --> 13:27.766
than me sitting around
watching my phone.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.477
Plus, it might solve
my problem with Patrick.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.312
Okay, we can discuss
any new drama

13:32.353 --> 13:33.647
over cocktails at 30,000 feet.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.690
(Naomi laughs)

13:35.732 --> 13:37.066
(sighs)

13:37.108 --> 13:38.901
It's time for us
to take Manhattan.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.918
Is it just me or does it feel
like we suddenly stepped

13:55.960 --> 13:58.463
into an episode
of Sex and the City?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.131
Well, you're Author X,

14:00.173 --> 14:01.549
our very own Carrie Bradshaw.

14:01.591 --> 14:02.425
(laughs)

14:02.467 --> 14:03.551
I am sorry, Silver.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.052
Adrianna's totally
the Charlotte.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.220
Does that mean I'm Miranda?

14:06.262 --> 14:09.516
We fly across the country
and look at you.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.850
You can't stop micromanaging
your gestation station.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.019
She's a drag, you're a drag.
Fine.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.521
Okay, okay,
I'm not anymore.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.939
In New York, 'cause I'm
carefree and fun and sexy,

14:16.981 --> 14:18.483
and I'm going on a date
with Mark tonight,

14:18.525 --> 14:21.277
and I'm gonna be a total
Samantha, which means sex.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.070
Ew, he's still
our brother.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.071
Speaking of which

14:24.113 --> 14:25.573
I told him
to meet us

14:25.615 --> 14:26.574
when he got done shopping.

14:26.616 --> 14:27.701
Where is your tuxedo?

14:27.742 --> 14:29.744
You said black tie--
this is a black tie.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.414
NAOMI:
Oh, my God.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.666
What the hell?

14:34.708 --> 14:37.502
Well, that's a sign
that I obviously need

14:37.544 --> 14:39.128
to dress you tonight
for the auction.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.880
What is this, a quirky
rebel-may-care look?

14:40.921 --> 14:43.341
It's never gonna survive the
scrutiny of Jordan's mother.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.592
(sighs)

14:44.634 --> 14:47.261
Come on,
we have to go.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.555
I think you wear New York well.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.473
This ain't exactly
Mojave, huh?

14:50.515 --> 14:52.183
Ah, you know, Naomi says "jump,"

14:52.225 --> 14:53.768
we all hop a plane
and go across country.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.269
When we're done
with her thing,

14:55.311 --> 14:58.064
I'm going to treat you to
the best pizza in the city.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.440
NAOMI:
Mark?

14:59.482 --> 15:01.401
Now!

15:01.442 --> 15:03.110
Time to jump again.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.116
Hey, Dixon.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.203
(sighs)

15:15.122 --> 15:17.208
Are you all right?

15:19.502 --> 15:22.380
Annie told me how
she paid for my rehab.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.219
(sighs)
Yeah.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.304
I kind of figured you knew.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.640
The only person that knows
Annie better than me is you.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.726
You have to understand
that everything

15:34.768 --> 15:36.102
Annie did was to help you.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.896
I know...

15:37.937 --> 15:39.439
I just can't believe
my sister went through

15:39.480 --> 15:41.190
all of that torture
because of me.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.191
And now

15:42.233 --> 15:44.778
Patrick is messing
with her again.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.905
I don't know, dude,
I'm just so pissed.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.072
I don't even know what to do.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.115
Last year, when I found out,

15:49.156 --> 15:50.784
I punched the son of a bitch.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.160
Are you serious?

15:53.202 --> 15:56.163
Didn't change what happened
to Annie, but...

15:56.205 --> 15:58.666
it made me feel better about
taking things into my own hands.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.342
Hey, uh...

16:08.384 --> 16:10.553
You busy?
Uh, kind of.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.513
I'm just working
on music stuff.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.849
Cool, uh...

16:14.891 --> 16:15.975
I need a favor.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.185
Is that what we're calling
the other night?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.687
No, no. (laughs)

16:19.729 --> 16:21.522
It's... it's not about that.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.441
Uh, Liam and I need
your help. Uh...

16:23.483 --> 16:25.652
we really need to get
in touch with Olly Murs.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.945
I know his drummer.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.822
I could totally
call him for you guys.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.783
You are the best.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.244
Um...

16:36.871 --> 16:39.916
About the other night--
I'm still trying

16:39.958 --> 16:41.668
to figure out what it meant.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.377
Yeah, I don't know.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.422
I mean, us together dredges up
a lot of drama.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.507
Yeah.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.508
Silver's already on my warpath,

16:48.549 --> 16:49.801
and she'll think
that I'm hooking up

16:49.843 --> 16:50.802
with you to get revenge.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.428
Yeah, yeah, you might be right.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.597
And I certainly don't want
to repeat past mistakes.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.976
Me either, so maybe we should
just shut the door on us.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.311
Consider it dead-bolted.
The other night was our

17:00.353 --> 17:01.938
real last night together.

17:01.980 --> 17:05.273
And not just the last time
until the next time.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.277
Yes, the last time was
the real last time.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.445
(laughs)
Yeah.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.575
Well, uh, get back to work.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.836
Whoa, buddy.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.295
At least buy me dinner first.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.964
Naomi, I've been scrubbed,

17:28.006 --> 17:30.216
buffed, bronzed
and manscaped.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.302
I'm trying to be a good sport,
but none of this is me at all.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.429
I know, you're no
small undertaking,

17:35.471 --> 17:36.764
but we're making progress.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.098
Actually you
look quite dapper.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.142
I'm finally starting to see
the family resemblance.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.812
But I do need to brief
the all-new you.

17:42.854 --> 17:47.066
What's wrong with the not-new,
actually-who-I-am me?

17:47.107 --> 17:49.443
(laughs):
Okay.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.030
First off,
you never owned a food truck.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.239
So, you want me to lie?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.490
Lie? What? No.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.116
Yeah, okay.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.326
A food truck is very...

17:57.368 --> 17:58.661
pedestrian.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.329
We're gonna spin the
details a little bit.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.455
You should take
mental notes.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.207
You own several
five-star restaurants.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.252
You're here in New York
taking meetings for
your TV cooking show.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.756
You are the next Gordon
Ramsey, only much hotter
and more charming.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.384
Uh-huh. You could just take
a life-sized cut out of me.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.803
Or a ruggedly handsome
ventriloquist dummy.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.264
You know what?
You might think
that this is silly,

18:18.305 --> 18:20.558
but I really need you
to be here for me.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.685
Max's mother hated me,
and that never went away.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.312
If Jordan and I are gonna
have a chance in hell,

18:25.354 --> 18:28.024
I have to present
the best possible me,

18:28.066 --> 18:31.027
and that means the best
possible you, okay?

18:31.069 --> 18:32.612
You look great.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.696
What are you doing?

18:33.738 --> 18:36.699
There's nothing wrong
with the real me.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.079
(sighs):
Mark...

18:42.038 --> 18:44.164
(Naomi gasps softly)

18:46.042 --> 18:48.711
(calls):
Sweetheart, I'm home.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.340
Oh.
Patrick.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.801
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your meeting.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.677
(laughs):
No, it's okay.

18:56.719 --> 18:57.637
Hi.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.722
We're running
a bit long today.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.432
Yeah, we have
a special guest

19:01.474 --> 19:04.310
from Beverly Hills,
Dixon Wilson.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.686
He called

19:05.728 --> 19:08.689
inquiring about
my charity for his
sister's organization,

19:08.731 --> 19:10.066
so we invited him
to our meeting.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.152
Hey, um...
I think you know

19:13.193 --> 19:14.070
my sister Annie.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.947
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.790
Uh, you okay, Patrick?
You don't look well.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.876
Oh, yeah,
he just... he works so hard.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.169
You poor thing.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.463
Uh, must be the jet lag.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.423
Um... Dixon,
I'd love to hear more

19:34.465 --> 19:35.508
about your sister's charity.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.551
Uh... Victoria,
excuse us a minute?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.386
Excuse us.
Excuse us, ladies.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.018
I want you out of my house.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.895
Gladly. Um... I just want
to deliver a message.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.273
You want to be a tough guy
and try to hurt me?

19:51.315 --> 19:52.692
Bring it.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.651
But, um...

19:53.693 --> 19:55.277
I wouldn't say
you're in a position

19:55.319 --> 19:58.238
to make any threats
towards me and my sister.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.870
I fight for the both of us.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.834
AUCTIONEER:
$2,500.

20:09.876 --> 20:10.877
$3,000.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.003
$4,000.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.004
$5,000.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.213
$6,000.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.756
$6,000.

20:15.798 --> 20:16.924
$7,000.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.134
Going once.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.094
NAOMI:
Annie, stand up straight,
stop fidgeting.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.013
Tonight you're a
lady, not a hobbit.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.430
You're also my
de facto family,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.307
since Mark apparently
decided to go AWOL.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.018
Well, don't worry,
these shoes cost more

20:27.060 --> 20:28.936
than a factory worker
makes in a year,

20:28.978 --> 20:30.396
and I'll even smile like this.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.357
And I'm a carefree
bon vivant who
lives on the edge.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.650
(Southern accent):
Hide your men!

20:34.692 --> 20:37.070
Whatever. You're
not related to me--
I don't care.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.907
Naomi.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.408
Radiant, as usual.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.745
But my mom just got off
the phone with the governor,

20:45.786 --> 20:47.705
and whatever he said really...

20:47.747 --> 20:48.789
kind of put her
in a mood.

20:48.831 --> 20:51.291
Maybe we should try
to do this another time.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.586
Absolutely not.
No, I am not one to be scared

20:53.627 --> 20:55.755
(laughs):
of a judge or secretary of state

20:55.796 --> 20:57.131
or Godzilla.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.465
(nervous laugh)

21:00.384 --> 21:02.803
Show me the mother.
Oh...

21:02.845 --> 21:04.805
And we have...

21:04.847 --> 21:06.682
incoming.
(groans softly)

21:06.724 --> 21:07.934
Ladies,

21:07.975 --> 21:09.560
this is my mother.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.644
(chuckles)

21:10.686 --> 21:12.479
Hi. I'm Annie.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.065
Hello.
NAOMI:
Your Honor.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.358
this is my sister
Annie, an incredibly
wealthy socialite

21:16.400 --> 21:18.277
who runs her own
charity foundation.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.154
(laughs): And... well,
that's Erin Silver.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.615
She's practically
engaged to my brother.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.700
Cheryl Harwood.
A pleasure.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.702
And you must be
Naomi Clark.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.037
It's wonderful to
finally meet you.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.288
Jordan's told me
so much already.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.707
And my daughter's told me
all about you.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.376
Something about you
publicly calling her a whore

21:34.418 --> 21:35.753
at Jordan's
offensive

21:35.795 --> 21:38.589
faux- Fifty Shades
of Grey book launch.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.175
I'm gonna go...
anywhere else.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.760
(giggles):
Me, too.
Mom,

21:42.802 --> 21:44.303
I told you that was
a misunderstanding.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.805
It's actually
quite a funny story.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.681
I'm sure it is.
Is there a reason

21:47.723 --> 21:50.559
that your family hasn't
donated an heirloom
for my auction?

21:50.601 --> 21:51.727
JORDAN:
Mom, we talked
about this.

21:51.769 --> 21:53.146
Retract the claws.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.189
What? We're all here
for the same cause.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.816
If she doesn't have
anything worth donating

21:56.857 --> 21:58.734
then it's just a shame,
that's all.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.112
Excuse me, I'm gonna go
say hello to the mayor.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.992
She was actually
almost civil.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.118
(laughs weakly)

22:07.160 --> 22:08.077
It gets worse?

22:08.119 --> 22:10.163
Uh, I'll talk to her.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.416
Ade, you're
amazing.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.876
Well, you had a lot
of great lyrics.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.211
I just moved things
around a bit,

22:17.253 --> 22:18.671
and added some
new ideas.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.214
Like in
the chorus,

22:20.256 --> 22:21.423
when the two exes realize

22:21.465 --> 22:23.009
that they shouldn't go back
to a romantic place.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.969
Yeah, except that one of them
totally wants to.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.095
Like here,

22:26.137 --> 22:27.305
when you're talking about
the latest hook-up,

22:27.345 --> 22:28.764
you're wondering
if the last time's

22:28.806 --> 22:31.517
really gonna be the last time.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.768
It's like you want to rekindle

22:32.810 --> 22:34.270
that amazing feeling
that you miss.

22:34.312 --> 22:35.771
Really?

22:35.813 --> 22:37.023
Yeah.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.483
Yeah, and it's exactly
how I feel about Navid.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.027
Navid?

22:42.528 --> 22:45.114
Oh...

22:45.156 --> 22:46.282
your crush is on Navid?

22:46.324 --> 22:47.992
Yeah, for some time now.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.535
You totally
nailed

22:49.576 --> 22:51.329
exactly what I'm feeling.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.336
AUCTIONEER:
Many thanks

22:58.376 --> 22:59.503
to the Mallory family.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.380
Your generous donations,
year after year,

23:02.422 --> 23:04.133
are greatly appreciated.
Oh.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.346
Hey.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.306
Annie's car just took her
to the big interview.

23:10.348 --> 23:13.100
Mm.
You okay?

23:13.142 --> 23:15.144
No.
(laughs)

23:15.186 --> 23:16.103
(sighs)

23:16.145 --> 23:17.813
Jordan's mom
instantly despised me,

23:17.855 --> 23:20.107
I'm at a family heirloom auction

23:20.149 --> 23:21.942
without my family
or an heirloom.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.194
AUCTIONEER:
Our next auction item

23:23.236 --> 23:25.029
was donated by the Clark family

23:25.071 --> 23:26.613
of Beverly Hills, California.

23:26.655 --> 23:27.865
(applause)
What?

23:27.907 --> 23:29.783
Hi, Mark Holland.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.035
I'm here tonight
with my sister,

23:31.077 --> 23:32.286
Naomi Clark.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.704
What is he doing?

23:33.746 --> 23:35.915
No idea, but he
looks hot doing it.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.875
This is a bit
unorthodox.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.378
Our auction items
don't usually speak.

23:40.418 --> 23:41.879
Please explain
your donation.

23:41.921 --> 23:45.299
Myself, or my chef
services, rather.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.885
I'm offering an evening
of private cooking classes.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.678
The heirloom part

23:49.720 --> 23:50.888
is that I will teach you
a recipe

23:50.930 --> 23:53.224
that has been in my family
for generations.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.350
And I should add...

23:54.392 --> 23:56.143
that I'm really good
with my hands,

23:56.185 --> 23:57.519
and I don't mind getting dirty.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.772
AUCTIONEER:
Oh, my.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.065
So, for the Clark family

24:01.107 --> 24:03.025
donation of, uh,
cooking lessons,

24:03.067 --> 24:04.193
we'll open the bidding.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.611
I'd pay
a hundred dollars.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.904
Hmm.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.240
$1,000.

24:09.282 --> 24:12.534
Keep in mind, I never wear
this much in the kitchen.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.493
$5,000.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.788
(guests gasp)
I have
$5,000.

24:15.829 --> 24:18.124
Would you like to counter,
ma'am?

24:18.165 --> 24:18.874
$6,000.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.001
AUCTIONEER:
$6,000.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.420
$7,000.
$7,000.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.921
$8,000.
$8,000.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.423
$8,500.
$8,500.

24:25.463 --> 24:26.590
$9,000.
AUCTIONEER:
$9,000 bid.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.634
$10,000.
$10,000!
(guests gasp)

24:28.675 --> 24:30.719
$15,000.
AUCTIONEER:
Do we have $20,000?

24:30.761 --> 24:31.845
$20,000.
(guests gasp)

24:31.887 --> 24:34.181
AUCTIONEER:
We have an even $20,000.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.934
Going once... going twice...

24:36.976 --> 24:38.060
Sold!

24:38.102 --> 24:39.019
For $20,000.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.230
Quite a generous
donation

24:41.272 --> 24:42.398
from the
Clark family.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.608
Well, since it's not
gonna get any better,

24:44.650 --> 24:46.026
might as well leave
on a high note.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.028
I'm gonna go
grab our coats.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.822
(laughs)

24:49.863 --> 24:51.324
Oh...

24:51.365 --> 24:52.741
I thought you hated
these things.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.076
But I like you.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.745
And as your big brother, can I
offer you a little advice?

24:56.787 --> 24:59.332
Maybe your problem isn't what
Jordan's family thinks of you,

24:59.373 --> 25:00.916
but what you think of yourself.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.002
You're good enough
just how you are.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.462
Kind of like your
$20,000 brother.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.130
(laughs)

25:06.172 --> 25:07.631
Ready to get that pizza?

25:07.673 --> 25:09.675
I was ready yesterday.

25:09.716 --> 25:12.510
(Silver laughs)

25:15.348 --> 25:17.141
Mom was really impressed
with your brother.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.477
She'd like to talk now,
if you have a minute.

25:19.517 --> 25:22.146
Absolutely.

25:24.023 --> 25:24.898
Thanks for being here.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.984
Hey.
Dude, I can't believe

25:27.026 --> 25:28.944
we pulled this off.
NAVID:
Yeah, thanks to Ade.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.654
Hey, Cassie!

25:30.696 --> 25:32.614
LIAM:
Ready to be our Gnarly Girl?

25:32.656 --> 25:33.740
No way!

25:33.782 --> 25:36.118
Yesterday I was
just being a brat.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.203
I didn't think
you'd actually

25:37.244 --> 25:39.038
bring me
Olly Murs.
Right?

25:39.079 --> 25:41.248
Yeah, well, that's how much
we want to be your sponsors.

Cassie, there's some stuff you

high school!

Or should I say, "records"?

28:07.478 --> 28:08.854
Can't believe we jumped
through all these hoops

28:08.895 --> 28:11.440

high school drama.

Huh?
I'm not giving up.

my entire life.

not freak you out

30:00.758 --> 30:02.050
like it does most guys?

30:02.092 --> 30:03.302
The future doesn't
freak me out

30:03.343 --> 30:04.678
because I don't
think about it.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.598
You can't not think
about the future, though.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.848
Sure you can.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.934
What lies ahead of us is
completely unpredictable.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.812
What good does it do to
worry about something
you can't control?

30:13.853 --> 30:15.481
Actually makes some sense.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.733
You know, since you're on this
"just say yes" kick,

30:17.775 --> 30:19.901
I should ask if I can
kiss you now, huh?

30:19.943 --> 30:20.860
(giggles)

30:20.902 --> 30:22.237
Samantha wouldn't
just say "yes,"

30:22.279 --> 30:24.740
she'd say, "hurry up."

30:31.204 --> 30:32.581
(sighs)

30:32.623 --> 30:34.249
Uh, come in.

30:36.710 --> 30:37.795
(chuckles)

30:37.836 --> 30:40.673
Hey.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.007
(sighs)

30:42.048 --> 30:43.216
(clears throat)

30:43.258 --> 30:45.719
So, I've been thinking a lot
about the other night.

30:45.761 --> 30:46.637
Mm.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.096
And our history, and...

30:48.138 --> 30:49.139
Yeah.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.141
(laughs) ...us saying
that we were over it.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.059
Yeah, I've been... I've been
thinking a lot about it, too.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.228
You have?
Yeah.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.523
Oh, that Olly Murs concert
turned out to be

30:57.564 --> 31:00.066
a-a high manipulation
to make an ex jealous,

31:00.108 --> 31:02.778
and it was insane and immature,

31:02.820 --> 31:06.323
and it reminded me of all
our old drama with Silver.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.866
Eh... us hooking up

31:07.907 --> 31:10.327
is so not worth all that again.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.621
(sighs)

31:12.663 --> 31:13.997
What were you gonna say?

31:15.415 --> 31:16.667
Oh...

31:16.709 --> 31:19.878
basically, exactly
what you said.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.590
I got to go.

31:29.680 --> 31:30.723
And then you broke up a marriage

31:30.764 --> 31:32.182
that you were supposed
to be planning.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.308
Only because I was in love.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.393
With the groom.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.519
Then you fled the scene

31:35.561 --> 31:36.729
and immediately married him

31:36.770 --> 31:38.522
which led to one of the times
that you were arrested.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.732
The charges were dropped.

31:39.773 --> 31:43.443
Let's discuss your marriage
to Max Miller.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.153
It only lasted
a couple of months

31:45.195 --> 31:46.363
before it ended in divorce,

31:46.405 --> 31:48.156
so I think it's fair

31:48.198 --> 31:50.743
for me to speculate
that you have no respect

31:50.784 --> 31:52.494
for the institution of marriage.

31:52.536 --> 31:53.704
No.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.163
That most certainly is not fair.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.998
I was very much
in love with Max.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.710
You can attack me with whatever
else you have in that file,

31:59.752 --> 32:00.878
but I will not sit here

32:00.919 --> 32:01.920
and be insulted,

32:01.961 --> 32:03.881
nor will I allow you
to insult my marriage.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.798
I have no regrets.

32:04.840 --> 32:05.965
We tried to
make it work.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.342
What the hell
is going on here, Mom?

32:07.384 --> 32:09.595
We're just getting to know
the real Naomi Clark.

32:09.636 --> 32:10.721
Your mother did
her homework.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.389
Discovered my lengthy
arrest record

32:12.431 --> 32:13.891
and a failed marriage,

32:13.932 --> 32:15.308
and let me know that apparently

32:15.350 --> 32:16.727
I'm not Harwood material.

32:16.769 --> 32:17.728
(chuckles)

32:17.770 --> 32:20.898
I came here to get
in your good graces.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.274
But you know what?

32:22.315 --> 32:23.734
I don't have to care

32:23.776 --> 32:25.485
what you or anyone else thinks,

32:25.527 --> 32:28.864
because I am good enough
exactly as I am.

32:28.906 --> 32:30.616
We're done.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.167
We go live in two minutes.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.044
Okay.
(chuckles)

32:43.086 --> 32:45.130
Better breathe before you
pass out on national TV.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.548
Dixon,

32:46.590 --> 32:47.674
what are you doing here?

32:47.716 --> 32:49.760
Uh, I just came to let you know
that I'm okay.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.720
And that I support you
and that I want you

32:51.762 --> 32:53.263
to go out there
and tell the truth.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.473
But...

32:54.514 --> 32:55.599
Look, I-I was just upset

32:55.641 --> 32:57.517
that I couldn't fix the past.

32:57.559 --> 33:00.186
And I realized
that I could fix right now.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.021
So can you.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.189
Just like you said,

33:03.231 --> 33:04.900
telling the truth
will set you free.

33:04.942 --> 33:06.819
(sighs)

33:10.614 --> 33:12.658
MAN:
We're ready to go,
Miss Wilson.
Okay.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.536
Okay,

33:16.578 --> 33:19.331
five, four, three, two...

33:19.372 --> 33:22.668
The immensely popular book
Undressed

33:22.709 --> 33:24.294
is the tawdry tale

33:24.336 --> 33:26.964
of a young escort
in Beverly Hills.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.591
Now, it's author has chosen
to remain anonymous

33:29.633 --> 33:31.718
until now.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.638
It is my pleasure to welcome
to the show tonight

33:34.680 --> 33:36.097
Author X,

33:36.139 --> 33:37.683
Miss Annie Wilson.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.017
(applause)

33:39.058 --> 33:40.477
Hi, Nancy.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.812
Hi, Annie, how are you?

33:41.854 --> 33:43.021
Good. Thanks for having me.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.272
Have a seat.

33:44.314 --> 33:47.317
First off, the
stories in your book

33:47.359 --> 33:50.821
are allegedly based upon
true events in your life.

33:50.863 --> 33:52.823
Is that accurate?

33:52.865 --> 33:55.116
Uh...

33:57.243 --> 33:59.037
Uh, yeah.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.581
Yes, it is.

34:01.623 --> 34:04.751
Um, Annabelle is me.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.253
(sighs)

34:18.348 --> 34:19.725
Annie, don't you know

34:19.766 --> 34:21.851
that best-selling authors
never carry their own luggage?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.897
Ah.
You okay now that the whole
world knows who you really are?

34:24.938 --> 34:26.857
Well, you proved our family
has nothing

34:26.899 --> 34:29.484
to be ashamed of,
so yeah, I am.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.652
MARK:
Good for you.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.654
I'm gonna go and see
if the limo is here

34:32.696 --> 34:35.032
to take us to the airport.
Okay.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.829
Patrick?

34:40.871 --> 34:42.163
You bitch.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.708
I woke up to find the press
on my lawn this morning.

34:44.750 --> 34:45.751
Everybody knows,

34:45.792 --> 34:47.085
including my wife.

34:47.126 --> 34:50.213
Payback is the bitch, not me.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.424
You brought this all
upon yourself.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.764
Yeah, so did you.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.816
LIAM:
Ooh, I cannot believe

35:09.858 --> 35:11.234
we signed Cassie McCoy.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.569
We did it, man.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.862
She signed the contract,

35:13.904 --> 35:15.405
and now we can start
the campaign.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.741
The photo shoots,
public appearances,

35:17.783 --> 35:18.951
commercials.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.118
Oh, this is gonna
be awesome.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.703
(knocking)
Hey.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.580
Oh, there's our Gnarly Girl.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.164
Hey.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.333
Yeah, about that.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.086
Bad news from
the momager.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.336
The momager?

35:30.378 --> 35:31.797
My mom's my manager.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.548
She found out you live
with Annie Wilson,

35:33.590 --> 35:35.467
the girl that wrote
that hooker book.

35:35.508 --> 35:36.384
How?
What?

35:36.426 --> 35:38.011
It's all over the news.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.805
Liam Court, the movie star

35:39.846 --> 35:41.514
is Leo in Undressed.

35:41.556 --> 35:42.849
Endorsements are all

35:42.891 --> 35:44.059
about image,

35:44.101 --> 35:45.811
and she doesn't want me
associated with you.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.270
I...
Sucks.

35:47.312 --> 35:48.730
I'm really sorry.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.315
Yeah.

35:50.356 --> 35:53.359
Uh... Uh...

35:56.154 --> 35:57.280
It's okay.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.865
Guess we'll just have
to find someone else.

35:58.907 --> 36:00.366
What's the point?

36:00.408 --> 36:02.410
She's right; endorsements are
all about image,

36:02.452 --> 36:04.162
and thanks to Annie, mine sucks.

36:07.582 --> 36:10.335
MICHAELA:
♪ I don't want this to end ♪

36:10.376 --> 36:15.757
♪ I guess I never got
over you. ♪

36:15.799 --> 36:18.635
(click, music stops)

36:18.677 --> 36:20.720
So you think Spencer Blane
will like it?

36:20.762 --> 36:22.347
It's really good.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.557
I can't believe you did that
in two days.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.977
Yeah, me either.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.771
This TV contest is gonna
be huge, national exposure.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.149
Then the concert goes
on a multicity tour.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.900
We're getting my song
in just under the wire.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.610
Hold up, a tour?

36:35.652 --> 36:37.112
I'm not okay with this.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.072
The only reason
that I said you could try

36:39.114 --> 36:42.200
is because Dixon said there's
no chance that you'd win.

36:42.241 --> 36:43.743
You said that?

36:43.785 --> 36:45.745
Uh, it's not how it sounds.

36:45.787 --> 36:46.955
Silver,
we can still discuss this.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.414
No, we can't.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.042
Look, there is no universe

36:50.083 --> 36:51.835
in which the woman
carrying my child

36:51.877 --> 36:53.086
is gonna go on tour.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.547
I...

36:55.588 --> 36:57.382
I'm sorry, Michaela. Michaela.
Michaela.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.675
Don't.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.802
(sighs)

37:01.761 --> 37:03.638
I was so stupid to think

37:03.680 --> 37:06.099
that blindly saying
yes was a good idea.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.980
Silver, c...

37:18.153 --> 37:19.696
Adrianna let me in.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.490
I guess my jet's
a little faster than yours.

37:22.532 --> 37:25.326
Why are you here, Jordan?

37:25.368 --> 37:27.328
Look, um...

37:27.370 --> 37:30.874
you never really gave me
a chance to respond in New York.

37:30.916 --> 37:34.669
I've never seen any woman
ever stand up to my mother.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.671
And whether
she likes it or not,

37:36.713 --> 37:38.590
I want to date you.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.885
So if you're willing
to deal with her,

37:41.927 --> 37:46.472
my mother's going
to have to deal, too.

37:46.514 --> 37:53.479
Well, I can't blame you
for your mother.

37:53.521 --> 37:57.150
And I do like the idea of
that banshee's head exploding.

37:57.192 --> 38:00.112
Well, I'm just hoping
that one day she finally learns

38:00.153 --> 38:02.572
that no one's as perfect
as she expects them to be.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.157
Including me.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.118
So...

38:06.159 --> 38:10.956
what do you say to a non-perfect
date with a non-perfect me?

38:10.997 --> 38:12.665
Mm.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.752
Oh, I suppose I'll let you
take me to dinner.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.130
Oh, you suppose.
(chuckles)

38:18.171 --> 38:22.050
MICHAELA (over speakers):
♪ I'm out of my heart ♪

38:22.092 --> 38:26.054
♪ I thought it was over then ♪

38:26.096 --> 38:28.765
♪ Are we back at the start? ♪

38:28.807 --> 38:30.725
(phone ringing)

38:30.767 --> 38:31.726
♪ ♪

38:31.768 --> 38:33.228
(music stops)

38:33.270 --> 38:35.147
Hey, I was just listening
to our song.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.607
(chuckles)
It's the one bright spot
in my day.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.734
What did Dixon and Silver think?

38:39.776 --> 38:42.737
Silver says it's so good
we can't send it in.

38:42.779 --> 38:43.863
What?

38:43.905 --> 38:45.031
She knows it could be big.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.783
She's not comfortable
with even the idea

38:46.825 --> 38:48.618
of me going on tour
while pregnant.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.997
(scoffs)
Okay, well, this is
a big deal for me, too.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.457
I know. And you wrote
a killer song, Ade.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.294
You're insane if you don't
pursue a career in songwriting,

38:57.335 --> 39:01.965
but... until I have this baby,
Silver calls the shots.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.554
Well, she doesn't get
to call them for me.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.316
(sighs)

39:21.860 --> 39:23.903
(footsteps approaching)

39:25.655 --> 39:26.781
Hey.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.366
I scheduled
tomorrow off

39:28.407 --> 39:29.993
since we haven't
even unpacked yet.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.411
What do you say we just head out
to Mojave after all?

39:32.453 --> 39:34.998
(sighs)
I can't.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.126
Gotcha. Formal wear
doesn't work for the desert.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.460
I guess we should repack.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.754
No, Mark, I mean I...

39:41.796 --> 39:44.132
I can't just leave

39:44.174 --> 39:46.051
or be impulsive

39:46.092 --> 39:48.427
or say yes to every fun thing
that comes along.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.680
Is this about the Mojave or me?

39:50.722 --> 39:53.850
ANNIE:
Hey, guys. We're getting
hungry out there. (chuckles)

39:55.601 --> 39:57.020
We'll talk after dinner.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.604
NAOMI:
We're all here

39:58.646 --> 40:00.190
to celebrate

40:00.232 --> 40:03.442
Annie's literary success
and bravery.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.070
But I think
it's fair to say

40:05.111 --> 40:07.697
we all had a pretty
successful New York trip.
ANNIE: Well,

40:07.739 --> 40:10.242
except for someone's luggage
getting held up at the airport.

40:10.283 --> 40:12.618
(Jordan clears throat)

40:12.660 --> 40:14.162
I'd like to request
a speech

40:14.204 --> 40:15.413
from my newest
best-selling author.

40:15.454 --> 40:17.082
Uh...
Yes, speech!

40:17.123 --> 40:18.416
ANNIE:
Okay, okay, okay.

40:18.457 --> 40:22.003
Uh, well, I am not
very good at speeches,

40:22.045 --> 40:26.007
so I will say that
my strength and bravery

40:26.049 --> 40:28.218
comes from
each one of you.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.678
And we're not
just friends;

40:30.720 --> 40:32.055
we're a family.

40:32.097 --> 40:35.474
And nobody messes
with my family.

40:35.516 --> 40:36.517
DIXON:
Hear, hear.

40:36.559 --> 40:38.019
MAN:
Excuse me.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.188
We're looking for Mark Holland.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.940
Yes, sir.
That's me.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.109
Does this bag
belong to you, sir?

40:45.193 --> 40:47.070
Yes.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.487
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

40:48.529 --> 40:50.156
You're under arrest
for drug possession.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.866
NAOMI:
Uh, there must be
some mistake.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.160
Mr. Holland's luggage was
flagged at the airport.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.871
We were called by TSA
and found cocaine in it.
