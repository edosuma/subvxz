09:38.248 --> 09:40.350
DOES ANYBODY WANT
HALF MY BURGER?

09:40.350 --> 09:42.282

09:42.282 --> 09:45.015
OH, JEEZ!

09:46.987 --> 09:48.819

09:53.894 --> 09:55.295
YEAH, NINA, NICE.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.297

09:57.297 --> 09:59.700
THANK YOU, SOCK.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.738
THIS IS WHERE THE SOUL
IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

10:07.738 --> 10:10.681
YEAH? GETTING
A LITTLE NERVOUS TO
THROW DOWN WITH HIM?

10:10.681 --> 10:11.712
IT'S JUST ONE PUNCH.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.043
BESIDES, THE DEVIL SAID
HE WAS A CHUMP.

10:13.043 --> 10:16.016

11:40.070 --> 11:42.933
THAT WAS ME

11:42.933 --> 11:46.306
YOU COME BACK AGAIN,
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.407
[GROANS]

11:47.407 --> 11:49.740

12:34.384 --> 12:35.225
I WENT OVER
OLD PAPERWORK.

12:35.225 --> 12:38.488
YOU AND LES NESSMAN

12:39.429 --> 12:41.031
SO WHAT?

12:41.031 --> 12:42.062
OK. YOU CLOCK
IN AND OUT

12:42.062 --> 12:43.233
AT THE EXACT SAME
TIMES.

12:43.233 --> 12:44.394
BIG WHOOPITY-DOO-DA.

12:44.394 --> 12:46.536
I CALLED
THE COFFEE SHACK.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.869
YOU DID?
YEAH. I WANTED

12:48.869 --> 12:50.140

13:06.857 --> 13:08.919

COLLECTING

13:09.920 --> 13:11.862
AN EXTRA PAYCHECK
FOR TWO YEARS, ANDI.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.423
HOW DID YOU
PULL IT OFF

13:13.423 --> 13:15.966
WELL, I DID HAVE
A LITTLE HELP FROM TED.

13:15.966 --> 13:17.127
TED HELPED? HOW?

13:17.127 --> 13:17.928

13:25.205 --> 13:26.436

13:51.401 --> 13:54.464
WHO'S GOT
YOUR BACK?

13:54.464 --> 13:56.136
THANK YOU, SIR.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.510
WELCOME

14:00.510 --> 14:02.412

OH, SURE.

14:05.275 --> 14:07.417
OH. COOL!

14:07.417 --> 14:09.479
IT'S FOR YOU.
IT'S A GEODE.

14:09.479 --> 14:10.580
IT'S GORGEOUS.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.552
IT IS SUPER-RARE.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.884
I SAW IT,
AND IT REMINDED ME

14:13.884 --> 14:15.485
OF HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU--

14:15.485 --> 14:17.457
SPARKLY AND WARM.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.230
IT IS WARM LITERALLY.
IT'S HOT IN MY HANDS.

14:20.230 --> 14:22.562
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S
FROM HOME.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.333
HOME?

14:23.333 --> 14:25.265
HOME.
DOWN THERE HOME.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.566
YEAH.
HELL HOME.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.138
YEAH. MIGHT HAVE
A LITTLE BIT

14:28.138 --> 14:29.539
OF HELLFIRE
LEFT IN IT.

14:29.539 --> 14:31.972
BUT DON'T WORRY.
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.204
JUST DON'T EVER
SLEEP NEXT TO IT

14:34.204 --> 14:35.405
BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE
YOU NIGHTMARES

14:35.405 --> 14:37.547
AND DON'T EVER
MAKE WISHES UPON IT

14:37.547 --> 14:39.349
OR GET IT NEXT
TO A NUCLEAR REACTOR

14:39.349 --> 14:44.314
AND THEN JUST USE
A REGULAR DAMP CLOTH
TO CLEAN IT.

14:44.314 --> 14:46.216
I--I LOVE IT,
AND I CAN'T WAIT

14:46.216 --> 14:47.988
TO SHOW IT
TO THE GUYS.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.290
OH. SO WHAT DID
THEY THINK
ABOUT ME ANYWAY?

14:50.290 --> 14:51.361
DID THEY LIKE ME?

14:51.361 --> 14:53.994
UH, YEAH, YEAH.
I THINK THEY DID,

14:53.994 --> 14:56.066
BUT I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU

14:56.066 --> 14:58.898
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.032
IS THIS ABOUT
YOUR DISASTROUS
TASTE IN WOMEN?

15:02.032 --> 15:03.503
BECAUSE DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:03.503 --> 15:07.577
I WAS THINKING MORE
ABOUT YOU COMING
AT SAM WITH A KNIFE.

15:07.577 --> 15:10.510
BUT I DIDN'T.
I CAME AT HIS BURGER
WITH THE KNIFE.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.443
I JUST WANT TO BE
CRYSTAL CLEAR
ON THE ISSUE.

15:13.443 --> 15:16.446
YOU'RE NOT DATING ME
TO KILL SAM, RIGHT?

15:16.446 --> 15:20.490
NO. BESIDES,
I DON'T NEED A KNIFE
TO KILL SAM.

15:20.490 --> 15:21.992
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

15:21.992 --> 15:23.493
UH, I JUST USE
THESE GUYS.

15:23.493 --> 15:25.625
I LIKE TO GET UP
IN THERE AND FEEL
THE HEART BEATING

15:25.625 --> 15:27.427
BEFORE I SQUISH IT
WITH MY HANDS.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.960
YOU SEE, THAT
DOESN'T MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.303
OK. LET ME SAY THIS
TO YOU ONE MORE TIME, OK?

15:33.303 --> 15:36.066
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND SAM
IN THE PAST

15:36.066 --> 15:36.967
IS JUST THAT.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.508
IT'S IN THE PAST.

15:38.508 --> 15:39.609
BESIDES, AFTER HANGING
OUT WITH HIM,

15:39.609 --> 15:41.311
I THINK HE'S
A REALLY GOOD GUY.

15:41.311 --> 15:44.674
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO
DESTROY HIM ANYMORE.

15:46.576 --> 15:47.547
OK.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.448
OK?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.520
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED
TO HEAR.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.481
GOOD.

15:51.481 --> 15:53.323
SO I FIGURED OUT
YOUR PROBLEM

15:53.323 --> 15:54.384
WITH CATCHING
THIS SOUL.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.486
OH? AND WHAT'S
MY PROBLEM?

15:56.486 --> 15:58.428
YOU ARE NOT
A BOXER.

15:58.428 --> 15:59.429
WOW! YOU'RE A GENIUS.

15:59.429 --> 16:00.590
YOU'RE GOING
ABOUT IT ALL WRONG, MAN.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.062
ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS LAND ONE PUNCH.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.563
IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
YOU HAVE TO AVOID

16:03.563 --> 16:05.095
GETTING HIT
FOR AS LONG
AS POSSIBLE.

16:05.095 --> 16:09.439
NOW THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN TURN YOU
INTO A BOXER.

16:09.439 --> 16:12.072
WELL, YEAH.

16:12.072 --> 16:16.246
BUT I CAN TURN YOU
INTO A DANCER.

16:16.246 --> 16:17.547
A PITCHING MACHINE?

16:17.547 --> 16:19.479
NO, NO.
NOT A PITCHING MACHINE.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.650

STUPID.

16:27.457 --> 16:29.559
GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME.

16:29.559 --> 16:30.520
OHH!

16:30.520 --> 16:31.521
HEY. I DODGED IT.

16:31.521 --> 16:33.393

16:44.434 --> 16:46.436

16:46.436 --> 16:47.607
OH. WELL...

16:47.607 --> 16:48.478

16:52.782 --> 16:54.544
OK. AAH!

16:54.544 --> 16:56.646

16:58.688 --> 17:00.490
Sock: ALL RIGHT.
HOW YOU FEELING?
YOU FEELING PUMPED?

17:00.490 --> 17:01.691
YOU SHOULD
FEEL PUMPED.
WINNERS FEEL PUMPED.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.653
NO. I AM NOT PUMPED,
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE EITHER

17:03.653 --> 17:05.755
IF YOU KNEW WHAT
WAS AHEAD OF YOU.

17:05.755 --> 17:07.427
OK. ALL RIGHT.

17:08.558 --> 17:09.359
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:09.359 --> 17:11.531
I WANT YOU TO HIT
MY HAND AS HARD

17:11.531 --> 17:12.662
HEY. DON'T BE SHY.
COME ON.

17:12.662 --> 17:14.534
DROP A LOAD
OF SAMMY ON ME.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.506
I CAN HANDLE IT.

17:16.506 --> 17:18.568
WOULD YOU QUIT
SCREWING AROUND
AND HIT MY HAND

17:18.568 --> 17:20.039
AS HARD AS YOU CAN? GO.

17:20.039 --> 17:20.770
THAT WAS IT.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.442
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:22.442 --> 17:23.543
WOW! YOU ARE WEAK.
SOCK, NOT NOW.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.615
YOU GOT THE PUNCHING POWER
OF A DRUNKEN BABY.

17:25.615 --> 17:26.816
KNOCK IT OFF.
I HOPE YOU THROW THE BONE

17:26.816 --> 17:28.078
BETTER THAN YOU THROW
THE FIST.

17:28.078 --> 17:29.679
I FEEL BAD FOR ANDI.
SHUT UP!

17:29.679 --> 17:31.251
HEY! WAIT!
SOCK, STOP IT!

17:31.251 --> 17:32.452
ALL RIGHT. SEE WHAT

17:32.452 --> 17:34.624
I GOT INSIDE YOUR HEAD.
YOU LOST YOUR CONCENTRATION.

17:34.624 --> 17:36.556
I SLIPPED A SHOT
IN ON YOU.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.287
SO.
SO?

17:37.287 --> 17:38.528
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO
DO TO RED, MAN.

17:38.528 --> 17:41.391
YOU GOT TO TALK
A LITTLE TRASH,
RATTLE HIS CAGE.

17:41.391 --> 17:43.293
BOXING REQUIRES FOCUS.

17:43.293 --> 17:44.664
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE?

17:44.664 --> 17:45.665
IT'S LIKE HAVING SEX.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.267
ALL RIGHT. EVERYTHING'S
GOING GOOD, RIGHT?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.638
YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR GROOVE ON,
CHUGGING ALONG.

17:48.638 --> 17:51.601
IN COMES THE TALKING,
THE HINTS, THE TIPS,
THE CRITICIZING.

17:51.601 --> 17:53.603
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE LOST THAT
CONCENTRATION,

17:53.603 --> 17:58.578
YOU'RE LOCKED
IN THE BATHROOM YELLING
AT YOUR OWN LAP!

17:58.578 --> 17:59.579
THAT COULD WORK.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.283
IT WILL WORK. YEAH.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.391
WOW. DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT
IN YOU, KID.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.322
YOU PROVED
YOUR POINT.

18:12.322 --> 18:13.693
YOU'RE NOT
A PUSHOVER.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.826
ANOTHER TIME,
I'D BUY YOU A BEER,

18:16.826 --> 18:18.298
BUT I'M A BUSY MAN,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.770
AND I'M NOT GOING
BACK TO HELL.

18:20.770 --> 18:23.333
I'M NOT HERE
TO DRINK BEER.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.375
I'M HERE TO FIGHT.

18:29.839 --> 18:31.441
OK. REMEMBER, SAM.
FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY

18:31.441 --> 18:34.584
AND LET YOUR WORDS
STING LIKE A HATEFUL,
SARCASTIC BEE.

18:34.584 --> 18:35.815
AND REMEMBER, DANCE,
DANCE IN THERE.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.448
DANCE IT OUT, ALL RIGHT?
KEEP IT LOOSE.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.190
ALL RIGHT.

18:42.892 --> 18:44.123
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:44.123 --> 18:47.126
MOVING!
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
THIS EASY ON YOU.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.828
WHEELHOUSE TIME.
GET IN HIS WHEELHOUSE.

18:48.828 --> 18:49.729
WHEELHOUSE. YEAH.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.461
I GOT TO SAY, KID.
I'M IMPRESSED.

18:51.461 --> 18:52.562
YOU GOT STONES
FOR DAYS.

18:52.562 --> 18:58.508
YEAH. WELL, YOU'RE
JUST ANOTHER BUM,
RIGHT? HUH?

18:58.508 --> 18:59.609
HUH?

18:59.609 --> 19:00.770
WHAT DID YOU
CALL ME?

19:00.770 --> 19:01.571
YOU HEARD ME.

19:01.571 --> 19:03.513
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
THE 29 GUYS
I PUT TO BED

19:03.513 --> 19:04.514
HOW MUCH OF
A BUM I AM?

19:04.514 --> 19:05.645
I'D RATHER ASK
THE GUY WHO BEAT YOU

19:05.645 --> 19:07.477
BECAUSE YOU THREW
THE FIGHT, HUH?

19:07.477 --> 19:09.879
YEAH. YOU WEREN'T SO
TOUGH ON HIM, HUH?

19:09.879 --> 19:11.721
NICE, SAMMY.
STICK AND MOVE.
STICK AND MOVE.

19:11.721 --> 19:13.853
WHY DON'T YOU
SHUT YOUR MOUTH?

19:13.853 --> 19:16.186
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

19:16.186 --> 19:18.558
HEY, SOCK.
HOW MUCH MONEY WE GOT?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.530
I DON'T KNOW.
LET ME FIND OUT.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.233
$13, SAM.

19:23.233 --> 19:23.733
WHAT DO YOU SAY, RED?

19:23.733 --> 19:26.936
$13 ENOUGH TO BUY
YOU OFF THESE DAYS?

19:26.936 --> 19:29.599
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:29.599 --> 19:33.543
MAYBE YOU COULD
PAY ME TO BEAT YOU.

19:33.543 --> 19:34.544
HA HA HA!

19:34.544 --> 19:37.277
UNH! UNH!

19:41.811 --> 19:43.483

RUN, SAM!

19:55.465 --> 19:57.767
OH, OH, OH!

20:05.275 --> 20:07.537
DID HE JUST KNOCK
HIMSELF OUT?

20:07.537 --> 20:10.209
YES, I BELIEVE HE DID.

20:29.399 --> 20:30.700
♪ PERMIT ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF ♪

20:30.700 --> 20:33.303
♪ THE NAME IS MR. KICKS... ♪

20:33.303 --> 20:37.637
MAYBE YOU, UH, MIGHT
WANT TO TAKE THE GLOVES OFF.

20:40.470 --> 20:41.841
FORGET IT.
IT'S TOO HARD.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.473
HEY, MAN. I GOT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

20:43.473 --> 20:44.714
YOU WERE AWESOME
BACK THERE.

20:44.714 --> 20:45.615
SOCK, HE'S--
LISTEN, LISTEN.

20:45.615 --> 20:47.477
I MEAN, IT'S AWFUL
THAT YOU PUMMELED
MY FRIEND

20:47.477 --> 20:48.548
INTO THE GROUND
AND EVERYTHING,

20:48.548 --> 20:49.719
BUT, OH, MY GOD.
WOW.

20:49.719 --> 20:51.551
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A HUMAN BEING DEAL
OUT PUNISHMENT

20:51.551 --> 20:53.823
LIKE THAT
IN MY LIFE.
IT WAS UNREAL.

20:53.823 --> 20:54.554
THANKS. THANKS.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.356
TO BE FAIR, YOUR BUDDY
COULD TAKE A PUNCH

20:56.356 --> 20:57.557
WITH THE BEST OF THEM.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.458

THERE YOU GO.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.760
IT'S NICE TO BE GOOD
AT SOMETHING,
RIGHT, SAMMY? RIGHT?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.592
SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED BACK THERE.

21:02.592 --> 21:05.395
I MEAN, YOU PRESSED
MY BUTTONS PRETTY GOOD,

21:05.395 --> 21:07.337

A GASKET.

21:07.337 --> 21:07.737
HEH HEH. YEAH.

21:07.737 --> 21:10.770
THAT'S--THAT'S WHY
THEY CALLED ME RED,
YOU KNOW?

21:10.770 --> 21:14.674
I'D LOSE MY TEMPER,
AND THAT'S ALL I COULD SEE.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.276
RED.
RED. BUT THAT'S NOT

21:17.276 --> 21:19.749
WHAT I'M ABOUT.

21:19.749 --> 21:22.912
NOT ANYMORE.

21:22.912 --> 21:25.915
[SQUEAK]

21:25.915 --> 21:27.987
BEAT HALF THE GUYS
ON THIS WALL.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.660
OH, YEAH?
YEAH.

21:30.660 --> 21:31.721
I SHOULD BE UP THERE.

21:31.721 --> 21:33.663
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT?

21:33.663 --> 21:37.627
DISGRACED MYSELF.
DISGRACED THE GAME.

21:37.627 --> 21:40.530
TOOK A BRIBE,
AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

21:40.530 --> 21:41.571
WELL, IF YOU WERE
SO GOOD,

21:41.571 --> 21:43.302
WHY'D YOU THROW
THE FIGHT?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.635
A GUY COMES TO ME,
HE, UH...

21:45.635 --> 21:49.439
OFFERS ME MORE MONEY THAN
WHAT THE PRIZE MONEY WAS.

21:49.439 --> 21:50.740
I GOT GREEDY.

21:50.740 --> 21:55.545
WOUND UP BEING
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
I EVER MADE.

21:55.545 --> 21:57.917
FIXING TO CHANGE
THAT, THOUGH.

21:57.917 --> 22:01.050
SO. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SEND ME BACK
TO HELL, HUH?

22:01.050 --> 22:03.593
DON'T REALLY
HAVE A CHOICE.
DEVIL OWNS MY SOUL.

22:03.593 --> 22:07.627
SOONER OR LATER,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CAPTURE YOU.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.659
PROBABLY LATER.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.032
LOOK. I'M NOT LOOKING
TO HURT ANYBODY

22:13.032 --> 22:15.505
OR KILL ANYBODY, EH?

22:15.505 --> 22:20.370
I GOT ONE GOAL
AND ONE GOAL ONLY--

22:20.370 --> 22:22.412
WIN THAT TITLE.

22:22.412 --> 22:23.773
FIGURE IT WILL TAKE ME
7 FIGHTS.

22:23.773 --> 22:26.746
FIRST ONE IS NEXT WEEK
IN VEGAS,

22:26.746 --> 22:29.549
SO I THINK I COULD HAVE
THE WHOLE THING WRAPPED UP

22:29.549 --> 22:31.020
IN TWO YEARS TOPS.

22:31.020 --> 22:32.422
SO...

22:32.422 --> 22:35.585
SO. I GOT
A PROPOSITION.

22:35.585 --> 22:37.427
LET ME DO THIS.

22:37.427 --> 22:38.728
GIVE ME THE TWO YEARS.

22:38.728 --> 22:42.632
I WIN THE TITLE,
THEN I'LL GO BACK
TO HELL WILLINGLY.

22:42.632 --> 22:43.733
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

22:43.733 --> 22:45.665
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

22:45.665 --> 22:48.498
LOOK. EITHER YOU GO BACK
WITH ME IN THAT RING

22:48.498 --> 22:50.770
AND I BEAT YOU
TO A PULP AGAIN,

22:50.770 --> 22:53.503
OR YOU CAN TAKE
MY PROPOSITION
TO YOUR BOSS

22:53.503 --> 22:55.575
AND SEE WHAT HE HAS
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

22:55.575 --> 22:59.949
WELL, I GUESS I'LL RUN IT
UP THE FLAGPOLE.

22:59.949 --> 23:02.482
YEAH. GOOD CHOICE.

23:08.718 --> 23:09.819
THIS ISN'T FOR ME.

23:09.819 --> 23:11.591
I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH
CORPORATE.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.662
AW. HOW IS CORPORATE?

23:12.662 --> 23:14.123
UH, NOT GOOD,
ACTUALLY.

23:14.123 --> 23:16.526
IT SEEMS THAT THEY
GOT A CALL FROM
A MR. LES NESSMAN.

23:16.526 --> 23:18.397
OH.
YEAH.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.569
HE THREATENED
TO FILE

23:19.569 --> 23:20.570
A SEXUAL HARASSMENT
SUIT AGAINST ME.

23:20.570 --> 23:22.802
APPARENTLY, I KEEP
ASKING HIM TO DO ME
IN THE TOOL CORRAL.

23:22.802 --> 23:26.676
NOW, SOMEHOW I AM SENSING
THAT YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT
UPSET ABOUT THIS.

23:26.676 --> 23:28.037
SOCK, WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?!

23:28.037 --> 23:29.779
WHOA! HEY, LOWER YOUR
VOICE, ALL RIGHT?

23:29.779 --> 23:30.910
I SOLVED OUR
PROBLEM, ANDI.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.883
YOU CAN'T FIRE NESSMAN NOW
OR YOU LOOK LIKE A HARASSER.

23:33.883 --> 23:35.715
THIS WAY, YOU'RE
OFF THE HOOK,

23:35.715 --> 23:36.846
I KEEP GETTING PAID.

23:36.846 --> 23:39.589
EVERYONE WINS.
WHO'S GOT YOUR BACK?
SOCK DOES.

23:39.589 --> 23:41.420
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.822
I ALMOST GOT FIRED.

23:42.822 --> 23:43.192
OH.

23:43.192 --> 23:44.994
I HAVE TO GO
TO A 2-DAY SEXUAL
HARASSMENT SEMINAR.

23:44.994 --> 23:48.698
HA HA. OH, ANDI,
OH, SO NEW TO THE WAYS
OF THE CORPORATE WORLD.

23:48.698 --> 23:51.731
YOU CANNOT PLAY
BY THE RULES WITH
THE BIG BOYS, ALL RIGHT?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.002
YOU GOT TO PLAY DIRTY.

23:53.002 --> 23:54.504
PUNCH 'EM IN THE NUTS.

23:54.504 --> 23:55.535
WANT A LITTLE SODA?

23:55.535 --> 23:56.766
NO. I'M GOOD, THANKS.

23:56.766 --> 23:57.907
OK. SUIT YOURSELF.

23:57.907 --> 23:59.469
PERFECT.
MORE FOR ME.

23:59.469 --> 24:01.471
Sam: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I DON'T LOOK GOOD?

24:01.471 --> 24:02.642
NO. I JUST THINK YOU
COULD LOOK BETTER.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.844
YOU'VE HAD THIS LOOK
FOR A LONG TIME NOW.

24:04.844 --> 24:05.975
I LIKE THIS LOOK.

24:05.975 --> 24:07.577
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GROW A SOUL PATCH.

24:07.577 --> 24:09.078
NO. I'M NOT GROWING
A DOUCHE TAG.

24:09.078 --> 24:10.449
HEY, I LIKE
SOUL PATCHES.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.652
A TINY BEARD ISN'T
GOING TO HELP ME, BEN.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.823
ALL RIGHT. FINE.

24:13.823 --> 24:14.654
HOW ABOUT SIDEBURNS?

24:14.654 --> 24:16.155
ALL RIGHT. SEE, NOW
SIDEBURNS MIGHT BE
A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.527
HEY, THERE'S NINA.

24:17.527 --> 24:19.559
Sam: YEAH, THAT'S HER.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.761
SHE AIN'T SLOWING
DOWN. BEN.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.233
BEN, BEN!
GO!

24:26.636 --> 24:28.598
UGH. GOD.

24:28.598 --> 24:30.770
OH, MY GOSH.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.843
I--I'M SORRY.
I GOT CONFUSED

24:33.843 --> 24:35.144
WITH THE PEDALS
AND HOW THEY
WORK...

24:35.144 --> 24:36.506
ARE YOU OK?
YEAH. I
THINK SO.

24:36.506 --> 24:37.577
ARE YOU SURE?
YOU OK?

24:37.577 --> 24:38.608
YEAH. I
THINK SO.

24:38.608 --> 24:39.949
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

24:39.949 --> 24:40.950
I HAVEN'T BEEN
DRIVING THAT LONG...

24:40.950 --> 24:42.982
YOU ALMOST KILLED SAM.
THAT IS NOT OK.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.113
BEN, I'M NOT HURT.
IT'S OK.

24:44.113 --> 24:46.616
WE TALKED ABOUT
THIS, REMEMBER?
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

24:46.616 --> 24:47.917
TALKED ABOUT WHAT?

24:47.917 --> 24:48.788
IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.019
I DON'T THINK I BELIEVE YOU.

24:50.019 --> 24:51.791
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
BEING A BAD BOYFRIEND.

24:51.791 --> 24:52.762
I JUST GOT IN
A CAR ACCIDENT, BEN.

24:52.762 --> 24:56.826
EXCUSE ME. WHY WOULD
YOUR GIRLFRIEND ALMOST
HITTING ME WITH A CAR

24:56.826 --> 24:59.168
NOT BE AN ACCIDENT?

24:59.168 --> 25:00.069
UM...UH...

25:00.069 --> 25:02.702
BECAUSE I'M
A DEMON.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.175
OK. SO...
SO THERE.
I SAID IT.

25:06.175 --> 25:08.708
AND--ACTUALLY,
I FEEL BETTER
FOR HAVING SAID IT

25:08.708 --> 25:10.680
BECAUSE NOW WE CAN
ALL MOVE FORWARD.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.582
YOU'RE A DEMON?

25:12.842 --> 25:14.944
YOU MET A DEMON
AT THE MALL?

25:14.944 --> 25:16.846
SHE'S THE DEMON
WHO KIDNAPPED ME.

25:16.846 --> 25:18.588
THE DEMON WHO
KIDNAPPED YOU? BUT YOU--

25:18.588 --> 25:20.950
YOU MEAN THE DEMON
WHO TRIED TO KILL ME?

25:20.950 --> 25:23.623
Ben: ALSO THAT. YES.

25:25.094 --> 25:26.926
Sam: HEY, SOCK,

25:26.926 --> 25:28.558
LOCK--LOCK THE DOOR.

25:28.558 --> 25:30.299
OK.

25:32.602 --> 25:34.133
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:34.133 --> 25:35.735
NINA IS
A DEMON.
OH, WHAT?

25:35.735 --> 25:38.067
YEAH. SHE'S THE DEMON
THAT TRIED TO KILL ME,

25:38.067 --> 25:39.268
AND BEN IS DATING HER!

25:39.268 --> 25:40.770
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
BUYING MORE PANTS, MAN.

25:40.770 --> 25:42.211
LISTEN, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

25:42.211 --> 25:42.742
"WHAT I THINK"?

25:42.742 --> 25:44.974
I THINK YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH THE THING THAT WAS
SENT TO MURDER ME!

25:44.974 --> 25:46.576
AND YOU'VE BEEN
LYING TO US.

25:46.576 --> 25:47.717
AND YOU'VE BEEN
LYING TO US.

25:47.717 --> 25:49.679
WHICH IS THE MOST HURTFUL
THING OF IT ALL TO ME.

25:49.679 --> 25:51.851
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU
THE TRUTH EVENTUALLY, UH,

25:51.851 --> 25:52.852
WHEN YOU GOT TO KNOW HER.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.585
THERE IS SOMETHING
SERIOUSLY WRONG
WITH YOU, MAN.

25:55.585 --> 25:55.985
REALLY.

25:55.985 --> 25:58.327
LOOK, SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO KILL YOU ANYMORE.
AND I WANTED TO BELIEVE HER.

25:58.327 --> 25:59.659
OH, OH, OH, OH, YOU
WANTED TO BELIEVE HER.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.830
[CHUCKLING]
HE WANTED TO BELIEVE
HER. THAT'S GOOD.

26:00.830 --> 26:03.332
Ben: I'M SORRY. LET ME
TALK TO HER, PLEASE.

26:03.332 --> 26:04.934
NO. THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.
SHE'S A DEMON.

26:04.934 --> 26:06.565
AS LONG AS
SHE'S AROUND,
I'M IN DANGER.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.838
WE'RE ALL IN DANGER.
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.

26:08.838 --> 26:09.599
GUYS, IF YOU WOULD JUST--

26:09.599 --> 26:11.270
NO, BEN, IF YOU
EVER THOUGHT OF
US AS FRIENDS,

26:11.270 --> 26:13.703
YOU HAVE TO
BREAK UP WITH NINA.

26:25.785 --> 26:29.819
HEY, DID YOU KNOW
SOCK WAS LES NESSMAN?

26:29.819 --> 26:30.119
UH...

26:30.119 --> 26:32.091
THINK ABOUT YOUR
ANSWER REALLY HARD.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.723
I MIGHT HAVE HAD
AN IDEA.

26:33.723 --> 26:37.066
I--I MIGHT HAVE HELPED
CRAFT LES NESSMAN'S RESUME.

26:37.066 --> 26:38.828
WHAT? WHY WOULDN'T
YOU TELL ME THAT?

26:38.828 --> 26:41.230
WELL, BECAUSE BEFORE
YOU WERE BOSS, IT
NEVER REALLY CAME UP.

26:41.230 --> 26:42.131
AND THEN WHEN IT
DID COME UP,

26:42.131 --> 26:45.104
I DECIDED TO LEAVE IT
