19:13.326 --> 19:14.542
They delivered the food.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.661
Slim Jims, Cheez-its,
Pizza Pringles,

19:16.663 --> 19:18.713
and two ham
and cheese sandwiches.

19:18.715 --> 19:21.549
Ham?
Where's the prosciutto?

19:21.551 --> 19:22.884
There is none.

19:23.786 --> 19:25.053
<i>Mais pourquoi?</i>

19:25.055 --> 19:28.388
Because we're
at a motel in Kansas.

19:28.508 --> 19:30.391
And the lady at the front desk
called me a snob

19:30.393 --> 19:32.777
for ordering
the Pizza Pringles.

19:33.279 --> 19:35.447
I can't believe
I'm not at the Grammys,

19:35.449 --> 19:38.782
and I'm stuck here eating a
lousy vending machine sandwich.

19:38.902 --> 19:42.235
Well, it's better than doing
those ketchups in the diner.

19:42.239 --> 19:45.290
And crash-landing
in a corn field with a rap star

19:45.292 --> 19:48.243
with our heads still attached--
that's pretty magical, right?

19:48.745 --> 19:50.879
Yeah, and 2 Chainz did say

19:50.881 --> 19:54.214
he enjoyed meeting us and that
we're two fine, big booty hos.

19:54.551 --> 19:56.868
Both:
That's pretty magical.

19:57.090 --> 19:59.053
Han's gonna be so jealous
when he finds out

19:59.055 --> 20:00.805
I met our boy.

20:00.807 --> 20:03.808
Oh, my God, we forgot to get
Han's T-shirt signed.

20:04.810 --> 20:07.143
Or did we?

20:07.764 --> 20:10.515
When you don't have enough money
to fix your own mistakes,

20:10.517 --> 20:13.268
you've gotta make
your own magic.

20:13.270 --> 20:16.387
Max, it's 2 Chainz
with a "z" not an "s."

20:17.139 --> 20:19.557
Damn! The one time
I know how to spell something,

20:19.559 --> 20:22.892
and it comes back
to bite me in the ass.

20:22.946 --> 20:24.162
Ooh, it's starting.

20:24.164 --> 20:27.497
Ready to go to the Grammys?

20:31.787 --> 20:33.571
Don't get any ham on the dress.

20:33.573 --> 20:35.573
We have to return these
to get our money back.

20:35.575 --> 20:38.376
You think Beyonce's
saying that right now?

20:38.378 --> 20:40.244
Hey, if we can make
our own magic,

20:40.246 --> 20:42.263
we can make our own Grammys.

[Joan Rivers impression]
Max Black, who are you wearing?

20:44.434 --> 20:47.602
Who are you wearing?
My roommate's rent.

20:47.604 --> 20:50.937
[Both laugh]

20:51.191 --> 20:53.308
You're right,
this is pretty magical.

20:53.310 --> 20:55.259
But wait,
I think it can get better.

20:55.261 --> 20:56.844

20:56.846 --> 20:59.030

<i>The Black Keys, Jack White,</i>

21:00.450 --> 21:01.766
<i>and look who's opening up
the night--</i>

21:01.768 --> 21:03.117
<i>Taylor Swift.</i>
[Bed vibrates]

21:03.119 --> 21:04.118
[Laughs]

21:04.620 --> 21:07.238
See?

21:07.490 --> 21:09.857
Way more magical.

21:09.859 --> 21:12.376
You know, this kind of feels
like the private plane.

21:12.378 --> 21:15.711
Yeah, the one I have
in my nightstand.
