00:45.504 --> 00:46.713
Aneesha.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.343
Aneesha.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.598
We should get in the basement.

00:59.685 --> 01:00.686
Aneesha.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.272
Aneesha.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.402
We should get in the basement.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.486
Come on, Luke.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.242
Come here, buddy. All right.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.036
Come here, buddy. Come over here.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.456
Watch out, Lukey. Watch out.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.640
Shit. All right.

01:44.813 --> 01:48.275
Well, we'll wait it out down here.
All right?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.946
I'm gonna need some light.
Could be in the box. Okay.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.492
Was that a fucking tornado?

01:59.369 --> 02:02.331
Miss Finnegan says
tornadoes only happen in other places.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.459
Probably she's right. Right?

02:09.169 --> 02:10.172
All right.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.218
Hey. We're…

02:16.720 --> 02:18.514
We're safe here together.

02:18.597 --> 02:19.806
With me.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.976
You promise that we'll be fine?

02:23.727 --> 02:24.728
Yeah, I promise.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.358
Promise, my love.
Would I ever lie to you, sweetheart?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.782
You smell good, Daddy.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.450
Thank you.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.414
I-I-I'm going outside.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.083
No, it's not safe outside.

02:48.544 --> 02:49.378
Aneesha.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.338
Aneesha. Aneesha, please?

02:53.048 --> 02:56.927
I'll go. You stay with them. All right?

03:00.180 --> 03:01.849
Listen, do you wanna hate me right now?

03:03.725 --> 03:04.726
Fine.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.354
But I'm not letting you go out there.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.106
It's not safe.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.732
Is it safe in here?

03:12.609 --> 03:16.280
Why are you fighting? Are you scared?

03:17.406 --> 03:19.825
N-No. No, no, no.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.786
No, baby. Everything's gonna be fine.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.663
Daddy's going outside
to talk to our neighbors,

03:24.746 --> 03:26.999
and Mommy will keep you safe in here.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.752
Right?

03:31.670 --> 03:32.671
Sarah?

03:40.012 --> 03:41.013
Ahmed?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.651
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.404
I can't find him.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.489
He's gotta be here.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.283
Dylan? Dylan?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.578
-Where are you?
-Dylan?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.216
-Barbara!
-Yeah?

04:18.300 --> 04:19.343
What happened?

04:19.426 --> 04:23.430
Everything. C-Cell service.
The-- The-- The power's flickering.

04:23.514 --> 04:26.517
O-Only the phone lines are working,
but I can't get through to 911.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.227
J-Judy thinks it's a tornado.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.689
Carl--
Carl said it was some kind of explosion.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.652
The Rothkrugs are leaving.
Do we need to leave?

04:36.735 --> 04:39.363
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

06:30.599 --> 06:35.062
I got, I, got, I got loyalty
Got royalty inside my DNA

06:35.145 --> 06:38.482
Cocaine quarter piece
Got war and peace inside my DNA

06:38.565 --> 06:40.484
I got power, poison, pain and joy…

06:40.567 --> 06:42.152
-Hey, hey!
-…inside my DNA

06:42.236 --> 06:45.155
-I got--
-Not bad, not bad.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.324
Holy balls, mate.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.034
-Alfie saw some tit.
-What?

06:49.117 --> 06:51.620
Yeah. In person. Nip and all.

06:51.703 --> 06:52.704
-You serious?
-Yeah.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.414
-One or two, man?
-Two, man.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.167
So basically, yeah,
I was out on the Lancaster bus,

06:57.251 --> 06:58.961
-minding my business, whatever.
-Yeah.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.713
And the sexiest girl jumped on.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.383
And while I was walking over
towards her, yeah?

07:04.466 --> 07:07.469
I swear, the bus, it hits a bump.

07:07.553 --> 07:08.971
-Shut up. Shut up.
-No way.

07:09.054 --> 07:13.100
Yes. And then,
her tits flap out for dear life.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.269
It was crazy.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.354
-You're so lucky.
-I know, man.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.481
And I was there, thinking to myself,

07:19.565 --> 07:22.067
the only other tits I saw in person
were Fat Tommy's.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.277
Yeah.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.361
It's true.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.530
I was praising the Lord.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.379
Hey, watch where you're going, neek.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.010
Did I make you
piss your trousers again, Casp?

07:48.093 --> 07:49.678
Do you want me to call Mummy?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.889
I-- I wouldn't want another freak.

07:53.724 --> 07:54.725
Stay where you are.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.977
Hey! Hey! Mr. Cuttermill!

07:59.771 --> 08:01.523
Is there a reason
you're standing over Mr. Morrow?

08:01.607 --> 08:03.984
What have I told you
about leaving him alone?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.111
No, sir. Caspar just dropped
his belongings.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.863
I was literally just helping him up.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.078
Is that true, Caspar?

08:19.708 --> 08:20.918
Yes, sir.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.794
Okay.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.299
Right, well, Mr. Cuttermill,
I think you've helped enough.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.051
I want to see you on that bus. Now.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.886
Bus. Now. Move!

08:32.554 --> 08:33.639
Are you okay, Caspar?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.893
Move! Come on!

08:39.019 --> 08:41.063
-Yo, man, Casp, you all right?
-All right, Casp?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.523
They're just tools, all right?

08:44.775 --> 08:45.901
Yo, you all right?

08:45.984 --> 08:47.319
Hey, man, they can't hurt you anymore…

08:47.402 --> 08:48.737
-You okay, bruv?
-…and that's true.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.155
Yo, Casp!

08:51.406 --> 08:52.533
Yo, Casp!

09:30.487 --> 09:33.115
All right. Just checking.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.951
You got everything you need?
Okay. You got a little snack?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.080
-Think he's all right?
-Yeah. He's here.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.707
-There you are.
-He's here.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.750
-You all right, man?
-Yeah.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.002
-Want a crisp?
-I'm okay, thanks.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.712
-You all right?
-I'm good, man.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.007
Come on, cheer up.
My favorite guy in the world.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.176
What the fuck?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.267
-Hey, look. It's the neeks!
-Wanker, wanker.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.685
What are you gonna do, pussy?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.648
Jamila, wanna sit here, girl?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.484
You can show me
where you got them other piercings.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.738
Listen up, bruv, and listen good.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.866
Unless you want me to kick
your undescended balls up your throat…

10:17.034 --> 10:18.202
…I'd keep your lips shut.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.787
Got it?

10:22.039 --> 10:25.501
Hey, all right. Settle down.
Jamila, sit down.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.085
Okay, one last time.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.171
-Has everyone gone to the toilet?
-Yes.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.341
We don't want any mistakes like last time.
Do we, Monty?

10:32.424 --> 10:35.511
-Hey? Hey?
-Hey!

10:35.594 --> 10:38.096
All right, it's a joke. It's a joke.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.182
Seat belts, seat belts. Everyone ready?

10:40.265 --> 10:41.934
-Yes!
-Let's go!

11:06.041 --> 11:08.001
Day one.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.215
You really piss me off, Hinata.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.968
You take my ring.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.763
You drink all the beer.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.100
You leave me here.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.729
I reinstalled Tinder.

11:28.564 --> 11:34.319
It's just to keep the bed warm

11:34.403 --> 11:36.822
until you're back.

11:38.323 --> 11:42.452
It feels like the air is
different somehow today.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.956
The sunrise and the sky too.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.753
It's like gravity is stronger.

11:53.714 --> 11:58.635
It's like it's trying to keep me
from floating up to you.

12:00.762 --> 12:07.477
When you come back…
I'm making you watch all of these.

12:07.561 --> 12:11.398
All 335 days' worth.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.531
I realized the strangest thing.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.161
It was that even though
I'm still here on Earth…

12:26.663 --> 12:28.916
my entire world has disappeared.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.175
See you tomorrow.

13:06.537 --> 13:09.206
Hi, this is Yamato.

13:09.289 --> 13:13.126
Hi. Can you come in right away?

13:13.210 --> 13:17.548
It looks like something happened
with the Hoshi.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.387
When did this happen?

13:23.470 --> 13:24.721
Three hours ago.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.599
We tried resetting the system.

13:27.683 --> 13:28.684
On what channels?

13:28.767 --> 13:32.145
135, 473, 997, 545. We tried all of them.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.897
-Any transmissions to NASA?
-Nothing.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.191
-What about Roscosmos?
-It seems like nothing there either.

13:36.275 --> 13:39.194
-The space station?
-No signal anywhere.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.614
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

13:43.949 --> 13:46.243
Sorry. She just woke up.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.749
The system didn't malfunction.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.710
No emergency call.

13:55.210 --> 14:01.091
That means some debris or a meteorite
could have crashed into the GS5 satellite.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.720
If something crashed into this
at a speed of 75 km per hour

14:04.803 --> 14:06.180
and at an angle of 34 degrees,

14:06.263 --> 14:10.142
it would damage the satellite and could
disrupt communications with Hoshi.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.561
Call NASA.

14:12.644 --> 14:15.772
Have them piggyback a message
on the A75 Mars probe.

14:15.856 --> 14:20.944
The thing is, NASA lost A75's signal too.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.823
It looks like the Roscosmos's
moon satellite signal went out too.

14:24.907 --> 14:25.782
What are you saying?

14:26.783 --> 14:30.245
It could be a massive cosmic storm.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.713
Connecting to the tracking
and data relay satellite.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.715
Triangulating a message to the ISS.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.719
What is this?

14:46.929 --> 14:48.889
An automated distress call.

14:48.972 --> 14:52.434
Unbelievable. A master system error?

14:52.518 --> 14:53.519
From when?

14:54.311 --> 14:55.687
Three hours ago.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.689
What do you mean, three hours ago?

14:57.773 --> 14:59.358
We just got them.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.651
Why now?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.403
Why are they just coming in now,
Yamato-san?

15:03.487 --> 15:05.697
-Did the system have some kind of--
-No.

15:05.781 --> 15:08.283
-Then why weren't they running?
-I don't know.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.997
-They should have been running.
-Should have been?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.542
So we didn't receive
the shuttle's distress signal?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.086
-Establish the connection!
-Okay.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.005
Captain Murai?

16:07.759 --> 16:09.219
Captain Murai?

16:11.680 --> 16:12.973
Hinata?

16:15.434 --> 16:16.768
Hinata!

16:17.853 --> 16:21.940
She's gone…

17:07.736 --> 17:10.489
This just in. Some tragic news.

17:10.570 --> 17:14.367
Space shuttle Hoshi-12 has exploded.

17:14.451 --> 17:18.079
At 14 hours, 17 minutes
after the shuttle's launch

17:18.163 --> 17:22.459
from the Tokyo suburbs
to the International Space Station,

17:22.541 --> 17:24.752
there was a serious accident.

17:25.838 --> 17:29.925
According to JASA officials,
contact was lost with the shuttle

17:30.008 --> 17:34.555
that was carrying three crew members
when it ruptured suddenly and violently.

17:35.264 --> 17:42.229
Astronauts Hinata Murai,
Satoshi Matsuoka, and Ryusei Ito

17:42.312 --> 17:45.107
are believed to be dead.

17:45.190 --> 17:49.528
What should have been a proud day
for Japan, science, and space exploration,

17:49.611 --> 17:54.116
has ended in pain and sorrow.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.117
How's it going, man?

19:20.494 --> 19:21.495
Paulson!

19:22.538 --> 19:24.039
-Yo!
-What's that you got?

19:24.122 --> 19:26.667
A love letter to me from your mom?

19:27.709 --> 19:30.379
Yeah, I think my mother
would give a lot more than a love letter

19:30.462 --> 19:32.548
to my guardian fuckin' angel.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.424
You are sick, bro.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.263
Yo!

19:39.346 --> 19:41.932
-What's good, baby?
-Temple! Hey!

19:42.015 --> 19:44.476
See the Temp? That's the man.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.604
Now, do me a favor, gimme a double-double,
medium rare, but burn one for this guy.

19:47.688 --> 19:50.023
-The Hurricane's hungry?
-You already know.

19:50.107 --> 19:53.235
Oh, shit. Action Jackson.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.112
Yeah.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.408
Yes, sir.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.492
How you doing, chief?

20:00.576 --> 20:03.161
-Jesus fucking Christ, Temple.
-Yeah.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.622
Not around the food, man.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.250
Can that shit up, drop it on Daesh,
win the war. I'm serious.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.585
We can't win the war yet.

20:09.668 --> 20:12.462
Paulson would miss the translator too much
to go home.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.339
Paulson, you're banging the translator?

20:14.423 --> 20:16.216
I don't know. He's kinda hot, bro.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.306
Hey, what I miss?

20:22.389 --> 20:25.976
Yo, Zem, you know that new translator
joined the army fuckers?

20:26.059 --> 20:28.061
-Yeah, he sucks.
-Yeah, that's what I heard.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.189
Smells like shit in here.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.691
Yo, suck it up.
Stop fucking up my food, man.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.568
Yo!

20:34.651 --> 20:35.736
-Hut!
-All right.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.488
Learn how to throw, bro. Go long. Go long.

20:38.572 --> 20:40.741
My people play baseball, dawg.

20:41.325 --> 20:44.745
Trev, can you believe this motherfucker
thinks that pro wrestling is real?

20:44.828 --> 20:46.955
Didn't you go to some rich people shit?
Harvard or something?

20:47.039 --> 20:48.749
Yeah. I studied macro and biology.

20:48.832 --> 20:52.002
And I know any dude
with that much muscle mass

20:52.085 --> 20:56.215
can legitimately kick
any man's ass in the ring.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.842
Madden, what the fuck do you know
about ass-kicking, son?

21:00.010 --> 21:02.137
Okay. What, you're an expert
at fighting now?

21:02.221 --> 21:03.931
-Yeah, I got my MBA in that.
-Oh, really?

21:04.014 --> 21:05.307
Come on. Come on, white boy.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.808
Let's go. Let's go.

21:08.352 --> 21:11.063
Don't make me embarrass you
in front of these white people.

21:11.146 --> 21:12.773
-Oh, no.
-Come on! Come on!

21:20.489 --> 21:22.241
Come on, man. That's my nice hat!

21:22.324 --> 21:23.659
Yo, Chavez!

21:25.869 --> 21:30.123
Hey! You guys all trying to bust ACLs
out here? Come on.

21:30.207 --> 21:31.375
Sorry, sir.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.459
Hey, boss.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.586
Your chat's blowin' up
like a motherfucker.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.129
-Hey. Satphone's up.
-Thanks, sir.

21:36.213 --> 21:40.592
Oh, shit. That reminds me.
I gotta call Coates's sister.

21:40.676 --> 21:42.719
Madden, go back to your PlayStation.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.392
All right, all right.

21:54.189 --> 21:55.190
Hey.

21:56.942 --> 21:58.026
It's been a minute.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.695
Yeah, I know. I just--

22:05.033 --> 22:06.243
How are you?

22:08.787 --> 22:09.872
Good.

22:12.416 --> 22:13.625
Got a draft deadline at noon.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.128
I just was calling--

22:16.211 --> 22:18.213
I mean, I should have called first,
but…

22:21.216 --> 22:23.886
I didn't think
we'd be talking today, so…

22:23.969 --> 22:25.053
Shit.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.471
-What?
-I mean--

22:26.555 --> 22:29.308
Nothing. I gotta go to work.
So do you. So…

22:32.311 --> 22:34.521
Okay. Bye, Trev.

22:34.605 --> 22:35.606
Bye-- Oh, hey--

22:37.316 --> 22:38.317
Yeah, okay.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.736
All right, baby, I miss you too.
Counting down the days, okay?

22:40.819 --> 22:41.820
Yeah.

22:41.904 --> 22:45.240
All right. I gotta go.
All right, baby. Love you, babe!

22:45.949 --> 22:46.950
Yo!

22:52.372 --> 22:54.374
You lookin' after mommy?

22:54.458 --> 22:55.626
-You the boss of her?
-Stop it.

22:57.878 --> 22:59.630
Rosa. Hola.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.590
Oh, my god. My hero.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.801
Alvie, you tell Trevante
I'll cook him my stew

23:04.885 --> 23:06.845
next time he's home.

23:07.596 --> 23:11.433
Is that right, Rosa? Maybe I'll go AWOL…

23:11.517 --> 23:13.727
…just to get a taste sooner.

23:13.810 --> 23:17.022
Honey, you'll be happy you did.

23:18.273 --> 23:22.861
You continue to keep all them safe,

23:22.945 --> 23:25.447
I'll cook the world, honey.

23:26.198 --> 23:27.449
Keep 'em safe.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.869
Yeah. Sí.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.415
Good… night?

23:35.499 --> 23:37.376
-Good night.
-Good night.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.754
We miss you so much, Alvie.

23:40.838 --> 23:44.216
We can't wait for you to be home,
sweetheart.

23:44.299 --> 23:47.469
I miss you too, Grandma.
Take care of yourself.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.680
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

23:51.849 --> 23:55.435
That was pretty good, dawg.
You learning. You pickin' that shit up.

23:56.144 --> 23:58.730
-"Good night."
-"Good night."

24:27.968 --> 24:29.011
Give it to me.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.805
-Oh, my God.
-This only gets better.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.351
What the hell, man?

24:36.435 --> 24:38.145
Yeah, that's what I've got as well.

24:44.318 --> 24:45.694
What's going on?

24:47.196 --> 24:49.364
Sorry! Jesus. Sorry, sorry.

24:50.157 --> 24:52.159
-Learn how to drive.
-It's just a pothole.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.327
Everyone all right?

24:54.661 --> 24:55.996
Okay, settle down.

24:57.664 --> 24:58.790
That's-- that's mine.

25:09.384 --> 25:10.552
You draw that?

25:11.136 --> 25:12.179
Yeah.

25:25.901 --> 25:28.070
-Is she supposed to be--
-She's the Xylon queen.

25:28.779 --> 25:32.699
She's the savior of seven planets and
the ruler of the far side of the galaxy.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.705
And him?

25:42.125 --> 25:45.045
He's nobody.
Just-- Just an alien.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.590
Well, I like how he's drawn.

25:58.475 --> 26:00.936
-What you got?
-It's just old stuff.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.272
I like old stuff. What is it?

26:04.773 --> 26:06.400
I got nothing.

26:07.985 --> 26:09.111
Can I listen?

26:13.907 --> 26:15.075
Yeah.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.333
…third base!

26:46.356 --> 26:49.401
"Emergency alert. This is not a test."

26:49.484 --> 26:50.485
What does this mean?

26:50.569 --> 26:51.862
I don't know.

26:51.945 --> 26:54.740
-What-- What the hell is going on?
-I'm not getting a signal.

26:54.823 --> 26:56.491
This is like 9/11.

26:56.575 --> 26:59.411
I'll bet you it's a dirty bomb.
It must be.

26:59.494 --> 27:00.746
A dirty bomb?

27:00.829 --> 27:02.956
You have a better explanation?

27:03.040 --> 27:04.917
You have any explanation?

27:18.514 --> 27:19.515
Manny?

27:21.892 --> 27:22.893
What?

27:23.769 --> 27:25.812
Why didn't it hit your house?

27:35.447 --> 27:38.784
I don't know. I guess we got lucky.

27:59.763 --> 28:02.724
-Mom!
-Mommy!

28:08.772 --> 28:10.983
-Luke? Luke! Stop!
-Stop, stop, stop!

28:11.066 --> 28:12.359
What happened?

28:12.442 --> 28:15.362
-What happened? Luke, what happened?
-My ears! My ears!

28:15.445 --> 28:17.990
-What is it?
-Stop! Stop!

28:18.073 --> 28:19.783
-Come here.
-Take him to the kitchen.

28:28.208 --> 28:29.710
Tell me where it hurts.

28:30.419 --> 28:31.545
Need to see…

28:31.628 --> 28:33.463
-Make it stop!
-You need to let me see.

28:33.547 --> 28:36.091
-You're hurting him!
-I need to see to help him.

28:36.175 --> 28:37.676
Please stop!

28:39.511 --> 28:41.430
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

28:43.515 --> 28:48.395
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

28:51.148 --> 28:52.983
There's nothing. There's nothing.

28:53.567 --> 28:56.153
There's nothing in there, sweetie.
Calm down, breathe.

29:09.291 --> 29:11.627
-It's all right. Breathe. Good.
-Okay. I'll…

29:11.710 --> 29:14.296
It's your ears?
Inside, there's nothing in there.

29:14.379 --> 29:18.091
-There's nothing in there.
-I'll call 911. All right?

29:18.175 --> 29:20.802
-Yeah.
-I'll try them again. Okay.

29:21.428 --> 29:24.348
-I wanna go too.
-Stay here, Sarah. Stay here.

29:28.393 --> 29:29.394
Can't you hear it?

29:32.064 --> 29:34.191
Hear what? Hear what?

29:35.275 --> 29:36.276
What it said.

29:37.319 --> 29:38.320
What what said?

29:40.405 --> 29:41.406
It's a voice.

29:42.282 --> 29:43.408
A voice?

29:44.243 --> 29:45.410
It's talking.

29:46.578 --> 29:48.872
-It's talking.
-S-Saying what?

29:49.540 --> 29:50.832
What is it saying?

29:54.336 --> 29:55.546
"Wajo."

29:56.255 --> 29:59.174
Sweetheart, I don't understand. What?

30:00.384 --> 30:02.427
Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo.

30:02.511 --> 30:04.513
-It's all right. It's all right.
-Wajo. Wajo.

30:04.596 --> 30:08.267
-It's all right. It's all right.
-Wajo. Wajo. Wajo.

30:09.977 --> 30:12.729
-Hello? My darling…
-It's gonna be okay.

30:13.313 --> 30:16.275
Yeah. I've been trying to reach you.
I've been thinking about you.

30:16.358 --> 30:19.069
It's been so crazy, what's happening here.

30:20.070 --> 30:23.031
You doing okay?
You still have power over there?

30:24.074 --> 30:25.200
What's happening?

30:34.751 --> 30:36.253
I wish you were here.

30:36.336 --> 30:38.130
I've been thinking about you.

30:39.882 --> 30:42.551
I have to go. I love you.

30:43.886 --> 30:45.345
I love you too.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.721
Casp?

31:32.309 --> 31:33.894
Casp? You okay?

31:37.397 --> 31:38.398
Casp?

31:38.482 --> 31:40.901
What's going on?

31:40.984 --> 31:42.778
-Casp?
-Hey, hey, hey!

31:42.861 --> 31:45.364
Where's his pills?

31:45.447 --> 31:46.782
Caspar?

31:53.956 --> 31:57.334
Caspar? Caspar?

32:08.262 --> 32:09.513
Hold on!

32:31.493 --> 32:35.455
The line was busy. I couldn't reach 'em.

32:39.376 --> 32:40.377
He's okay?

32:41.753 --> 32:44.298
Don't touch him. Don't touch him.

32:53.307 --> 32:54.850
Stay here, sweetie.

33:05.110 --> 33:07.738
You saw the way that
they were looking at me.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.698
And you didn't say anything.

33:09.781 --> 33:11.408
What did you want me to say, Manny?

33:12.576 --> 33:15.245
I'm your husband. Something. I don't know.

33:16.163 --> 33:19.499
That you're one of them?
That's how they always look at us.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.710
You're just seeing it for the first time.

33:25.172 --> 33:29.134
I'm here. I'm here now. Mommy's got you.

33:30.427 --> 33:31.428
I promise.

33:34.223 --> 33:35.349
Keep your head up.

33:54.076 --> 33:55.994
Come on. Come on, Sarah.

33:58.872 --> 34:00.332
-Feeling better?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

34:00.415 --> 34:01.792
-Stay here.
-Okay.

34:01.875 --> 34:06.088
Hey, it's going to be okay. Right?
All right. All right.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.264
Okay. All right.

34:18.308 --> 34:19.309
Listen to me.

34:19.393 --> 34:21.728
Go to your room. Grab the one thing
you wanna take with you.

34:21.812 --> 34:22.980
Okay? Go now!

34:26.233 --> 34:28.944
The hell is wrong with you? Come on!

34:37.828 --> 34:39.621
Luke! Sarah!

34:41.623 --> 34:43.250
What happened? What happened?

34:43.333 --> 34:44.333
Do you--

34:45.210 --> 34:46.503
Calm down!

34:57.139 --> 34:58.765
It's very clean.

35:18.327 --> 35:19.494
I'm sorry.

35:26.502 --> 35:28.420
It was her.

35:31.924 --> 35:35.719
It was her.

35:37.763 --> 35:39.223
She was…

35:40.974 --> 35:42.976
the one.

35:47.648 --> 35:48.857
Hinata Murai…

35:52.444 --> 35:53.445
was my…

36:01.578 --> 36:03.830
I'm sorry, Mi.

36:09.503 --> 36:10.504
But…

36:11.505 --> 36:13.924
perhaps it's for the best.

36:16.593 --> 36:19.805
Now you can have a clean start, Mitsuki.

36:21.265 --> 36:24.768
You can meet a nice man. Fall in love.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.397
You have a fresh start.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.985
How can you say that?

36:35.362 --> 36:36.655
It's just that I--

36:38.073 --> 36:40.784
Maybe this was fate.

36:40.868 --> 36:42.327
Like a present from heaven.

36:42.411 --> 36:43.954
A present?

36:46.331 --> 36:47.749
I only want what's best for you.

36:47.833 --> 36:48.834
For me?

36:49.835 --> 36:52.087
How is this good for me?

36:52.171 --> 36:54.089
This is just what's best for you!

36:56.091 --> 37:00.095
Now you can live without
the shame your daughter brings to you?

37:00.846 --> 37:03.682
This matter involves your soul.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.768
If you damage your soul, that's it.

37:06.852 --> 37:08.187
It's ruined.

37:09.646 --> 37:11.982
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

37:16.904 --> 37:17.905
Get out.

37:18.739 --> 37:20.407
I never should have asked you here.

37:20.490 --> 37:22.367
-Mitsuki--
-Get out!

39:57.606 --> 39:59.566
This is your fault, Mitsuki.

39:59.650 --> 40:00.817
No!

40:04.738 --> 40:06.073
What? What's wrong?

40:11.119 --> 40:12.621
I'm sorry. Get out.

40:12.704 --> 40:13.830
Why?

40:15.457 --> 40:17.125
-What's wrong?
-Get out.

40:19.711 --> 40:20.921
What's wrong with you?

41:04.047 --> 41:06.258
Hey, Chavez, get me something.

41:07.301 --> 41:10.012
It's still dark.
Zero contact with the TOC, sir.

41:10.095 --> 41:11.346
Radio?

41:14.183 --> 41:17.060
It's not like they were in a helo.
Nothing coulda wiped 'em all out, man.

41:17.144 --> 41:19.521
A whole squad doesn't just go dark
for that long.

41:20.105 --> 41:23.317
I don't know about y'all, but I've always
had a lot of fun in the dark.

41:23.817 --> 41:25.944
Yeah, except we're going out
in broad daylight.

41:35.204 --> 41:36.455
Any of y'all watch Moana?

41:37.623 --> 41:39.291
What? Like the Disney movie?

41:39.875 --> 41:42.461
-Yeah.
-I know Paulson's seen it.

41:42.544 --> 41:44.296
Yeah. Only ten times.

41:48.842 --> 41:52.763
I know everybody on this island's

41:52.846 --> 41:56.975
Got a role on this island
Maybe I can roll with mine

41:57.059 --> 41:59.394
How about we don't sing on the intersquad?

42:01.480 --> 42:05.651
I know everybody on this island

42:05.734 --> 42:08.820
Has got a role on this island

42:08.904 --> 42:11.073
Maybe I can roll with mine

42:11.156 --> 42:12.491
Everybody!

42:13.033 --> 42:15.369
You know, she's single, my abuela.

42:15.452 --> 42:16.453
What?

42:16.537 --> 42:18.622
-My abuela. She's single.
-Shut up.

42:19.122 --> 42:21.458
Like 'em young too.

42:54.449 --> 42:56.159
The hell's Maretti's squad?

42:57.995 --> 43:00.080
The channel's jammed. All I got's noise.

43:09.965 --> 43:11.967
Hey, where are our guys?

43:12.050 --> 43:13.218
The fuck?

43:26.565 --> 43:28.066
Twelve o'clock, sir.

43:28.984 --> 43:31.486
Madden, you clock these guys?

43:33.447 --> 43:36.116
No, no, no. Don't come close. Stay back.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.993
-Stay back.
-Calm 'em down, Zem.

43:39.536 --> 43:41.747
Hey, Zemar, ask him. Careful.

43:42.748 --> 43:43.582
Back up.

43:43.665 --> 43:46.168
Back. Back.

43:46.793 --> 43:48.045
Back. Hey, hey, hey.

43:50.714 --> 43:51.840
Back up.

43:54.843 --> 43:56.220
Another one to the right.

43:57.012 --> 43:58.680
Back up.

43:58.764 --> 44:01.058
Hey! Back him up. Take it easy.

44:10.567 --> 44:11.693
Zemar, what is she saying?

44:12.945 --> 44:16.240
She says others like us were here.
Sounds like Maretti's squad.

44:16.323 --> 44:18.033
-She says an attack.
-Taliban? Daesh?

44:19.660 --> 44:21.870
An attack. Something.

44:21.954 --> 44:23.705
-She's not making any sense.
-Daesh?

44:23.789 --> 44:24.915
She's not making any sense.

44:26.792 --> 44:29.586
They all say an attack.
They came-- They went to a school.

44:29.670 --> 44:31.797
Find a channel we can use.
Get comms back up.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.423
Find a fucking landline. Anything.

44:33.507 --> 44:35.008
Copy you, sir.

44:38.512 --> 44:41.098
It sounds like Maretti's squad.
They went to a school.

44:41.181 --> 44:42.933
A school. A school, sir.

44:43.016 --> 44:46.478
That's it, boys! Head to target.
We're moving to the school. Let's go.

44:46.562 --> 44:48.355
-Get back!
-Back up!

44:55.112 --> 44:59.867
Move back! All of you, move back!
Move back! Move, move, move!

45:24.641 --> 45:26.935
Got movement upstairs. Third floor.

45:53.795 --> 45:54.796
Clear!

46:03.931 --> 46:06.558
It's okay, guys. Stay calm. Stay calm.

46:07.559 --> 46:09.728
Candy? Yeah?

46:41.051 --> 46:43.428
Hey, Zem? Zem, get over here.

46:47.724 --> 46:49.017
Ask this kid what happened.

46:57.526 --> 46:59.444
ISIS? Daesh?

47:06.410 --> 47:07.661
Hey.

47:07.744 --> 47:08.745
Hey.

47:10.163 --> 47:11.164
Hey.

47:17.171 --> 47:18.338
Hey.

47:36.815 --> 47:38.442
See anybody that look like us?

47:39.943 --> 47:41.111
Americans.

47:41.695 --> 47:43.405
Tell him.

47:44.531 --> 47:46.033
It's okay. It's okay.

47:47.534 --> 47:48.535
You know?

48:46.760 --> 48:47.761
Come on.

48:50.764 --> 48:51.765
Shit.

48:54.852 --> 48:57.437
-We have to cross the bridge.
-Where are we going?

48:59.147 --> 49:01.900
I told you we should've never lived
where we had to cross a bridge.

49:04.319 --> 49:05.904
-I'm scared.
-Are you doing it right?

49:05.988 --> 49:07.155
Daddy?

49:08.198 --> 49:10.701
You had to get a Tesla.

49:12.911 --> 49:14.621
Wanted to impress her.

49:17.332 --> 49:18.542
Where are we going?

49:19.293 --> 49:20.752
Daddy!

49:31.305 --> 49:34.683
Hey, Mark. Mark. Mark.

49:37.311 --> 49:38.520
Come on, Mark!

49:40.230 --> 49:41.607
-Please, Mark?
-We can't--

49:41.690 --> 49:43.734
-Come on, please?
-We-- We can't fit you all!

49:43.817 --> 49:44.985
Not them. Just me.

49:45.068 --> 49:46.236
-Come on, Mark. Please?
-We can't.

49:46.320 --> 49:49.156
Please. Come on. Take just me.
Take me with you. Come on, Mark!

49:49.239 --> 49:51.241
Oh, come on. Take me with you!

49:51.325 --> 49:53.493
-Oh, come on, man! Fuck!
-Ahmed.

49:54.203 --> 49:55.495
Ahmed!

50:04.379 --> 50:05.964
You coward.

50:09.551 --> 50:10.636
Get in the car.

50:15.015 --> 50:16.391
What is wrong with you?

50:19.436 --> 50:20.562
What are you?

50:23.899 --> 50:25.150
I was gonna leave you.

50:28.445 --> 50:29.905
I was gonna tell you this week.

50:35.452 --> 50:36.537
Well…

50:38.330 --> 50:41.708
sorry you chose the wrong week
to abandon your family, Ahmed.

50:46.046 --> 50:50.592
Now get in the fucking car, you child.

50:53.303 --> 50:54.596
Give me your phone.

50:59.351 --> 51:00.352
I'm driving.

51:16.618 --> 51:18.287
What's happening?

51:25.460 --> 51:29.214
Everybody stop crying.
Everything's going to be fine.

51:41.476 --> 51:43.020
Everyone got their belts on?

52:15.761 --> 52:16.762
Check up.

52:25.604 --> 52:26.605
Sir.

52:35.989 --> 52:36.990
Make entry.

52:40.994 --> 52:41.995
Go.

53:05.310 --> 53:08.063
Shit. My comms. Do you hear that?

53:45.100 --> 53:46.935
What is that?

53:52.858 --> 53:55.110
Chief, where are you?

53:55.194 --> 53:56.987
-Chavez?
-Chief!

53:57.070 --> 53:58.530
-Chavez!
-Where are you?

53:58.614 --> 54:00.699
Chavez? Anyone? Chavez?

54:00.782 --> 54:02.075
Chief, where are you?

54:06.705 --> 54:07.789
Chavez!

54:08.498 --> 54:09.499
Chavez!

54:13.921 --> 54:14.922
Hold up.

54:16.048 --> 54:17.049
Madden?

54:17.633 --> 54:18.967
Chief? Anyone?

54:36.693 --> 54:38.195
-Chief!
-Chavez.

54:38.278 --> 54:40.072
Chief, where are you?

54:42.324 --> 54:44.785
Trev! What the fuck is going on, man?

54:44.868 --> 54:47.329
Chavez! Just follow my voice.

54:47.412 --> 54:48.413
Sir!

55:02.803 --> 55:04.263
Trevante!

55:39.590 --> 55:40.716
Contact, front!
