00:08.460 --> 00:10.530
Fletcher!
Where's fletcher?

00:12.560 --> 00:14.870
I haven't seen fletcher.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.610
Uh, I, I don't think he's here today.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.640
Oh, that's too bad,

00:24.680 --> 00:29.650
Because I wanted to commission
him to do a painting.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.850
I heard you were looking for me?

00:32.890 --> 00:37.390
I would like for you to paint my portrait.

00:37.420 --> 00:38.690
Oh.
Will you pay me?

00:38.730 --> 00:40.590
Not even a compliment.

00:41.730 --> 00:44.500
The whole point
of the a.N.T. Program.

00:44.530 --> 00:47.630
Is that I can take your
advanced natural talents.

00:47.670 --> 00:49.440
And exploit them for my own benefit.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.570
It's like a sweatshop.

00:52.610 --> 00:55.470
Only we have smoke alarms.

00:55.510 --> 00:58.710
Well, I mean, they're not
actually hooked up, but, um...

00:58.740 --> 01:00.450
We got 'em!

01:01.880 --> 01:03.510
What a witch.

01:03.550 --> 01:04.780
Who said that?

01:06.420 --> 01:07.550
She did.

01:08.790 --> 01:12.590
She's just jealous of
gorgeous women like us.

01:13.830 --> 01:16.790
Well, I'm off to the beauty parlor.

Oh, I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to, uh, him.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.580
What's up, stupid?

02:43.450 --> 02:45.480
What did I do?

02:47.790 --> 02:49.850
Chyna, we gotta talk.

02:51.490 --> 02:53.860
Whoa, nice look, cameron.

02:53.890 --> 02:57.560
What happened?
Did a unicorn throw up on you?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.500
I wish.
It's olive.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.800
Her locker is right next to mine,
and she is driving me crazy.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.800
She thinks she's my friend
because you're my sister.

03:04.840 --> 03:09.440
Shh! Easy with the "s" word.
Not everybody needs to know.

03:09.470 --> 03:11.380
Chyna, this is serious.

03:11.410 --> 03:14.580
Every time I turn around, there she
is, saying, "hi, locker neighbor!"

03:14.610 --> 03:17.450
You don't know what I've had
to put up with this week.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.750
So, you come here often?

03:20.650 --> 03:22.590
Hi, locker neighbor!

03:22.620 --> 03:24.620
Oh, is this the girl you were telling me.

03:24.650 --> 03:26.720
Was just desperate enough
to go out with you?

03:30.830 --> 03:32.760
Hi, locker neighbor!

03:32.800 --> 03:35.570
You left your locker open.
But don't worry,

03:35.600 --> 03:37.470
I kept your blankie safe.

03:41.810 --> 03:43.410
Hi, locker neighbor!

03:43.440 --> 03:44.640
Just doing a little redecorating.

03:48.650 --> 03:49.810
Oh, look,

03:49.850 --> 03:52.580
It's raining love and hugs!

03:55.520 --> 03:56.820
Wow.

03:56.850 --> 03:59.820
Even looking like this, I bet
girls still don't notice you.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.700
Oh, cameron, that's so cute.

04:14.740 --> 04:17.410
Is this where you keep your dollies?

04:18.410 --> 04:20.540
I don't have dollies.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.850
My dad threw them all away.

04:26.420 --> 04:28.650
Listen, I need some advice.

04:28.690 --> 04:33.460
Okay. For starters, don't
tell people you had dollies.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.490
Not that.

04:36.530 --> 04:38.430
What do you do when there's someone who's
annoying and you want to get rid of them?

04:38.460 --> 04:40.460
I just send them on a wild goose chase.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.460
Really?
Does that work?

04:42.500 --> 04:44.430
All the time.

04:44.470 --> 04:47.740
I even wrote up detailed instructions on
how to send someone on a wild goose chase.

04:47.770 --> 04:50.570
I could lend them to you if you want.

04:50.610 --> 04:52.740
That would be great.
Where are they?

04:52.780 --> 04:54.480
Okay.

04:54.510 --> 04:58.480
Now, head downstairs
to the sub-basement.

04:58.520 --> 05:03.520
Go to the boiler room and
look behind the water heater.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.660
There, you'll find the key to a box.

05:06.690 --> 05:10.530
And inside that box will
be a map of san francisco.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.800
Now, if you hold that map up
to the sun, at exactly dawn,

05:15.830 --> 05:18.700
It will reveal a trail to
a mini-mart across town.

05:20.770 --> 05:24.370
Ask for a mango slushie.

05:24.410 --> 05:25.740
Slushie?

05:25.780 --> 05:27.780
The clerk will guide you from there.

05:27.810 --> 05:29.580
Great! Thanks!

05:30.710 --> 05:32.720
So stupid.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.490
Seriously, what did I do?

05:44.630 --> 05:45.830
Oh, cameron,

05:45.870 --> 05:48.530
What happened to you?

05:48.570 --> 05:50.840
I went to the boiler room
like you told me to,

05:50.870 --> 05:52.770
But I didn't find the key.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.570
Oh. Right.

05:54.610 --> 05:57.440
The only thing I did find
behind that water heater.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.680
Was this tiny, antique cheese platter.

05:59.710 --> 06:01.750
And the cheese wasn't very good.

06:08.590 --> 06:11.290
Ahhh!

06:11.330 --> 06:13.700
You scared me, locker neighbor.

06:13.730 --> 06:16.430
Relax. It's just
cobwebs and dust.

06:16.470 --> 06:17.570
Ahhh!

06:17.600 --> 06:20.300
Dust is mostly made of dead human skin.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.670
There is nothing I'm more
scared of than dust.

06:22.710 --> 06:25.510
Well, except for ghosts, vampires, witches,

06:25.540 --> 06:29.710
Zombies, leprechauns, giraffes,
double-decker buses, balloons and...

06:31.380 --> 06:32.680
Curly fries.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.320
Leprechauns?

06:36.350 --> 06:37.690
Curly fries?

06:37.720 --> 06:40.660
I didn't realize you were
so easily frightened.

06:40.690 --> 06:42.390
Were you even listening?

06:42.430 --> 06:46.330
I'm only scared of the really scary stuff.

06:46.370 --> 06:48.400
For example, I'm not scared of spiders.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.740
Like that one on the back of your neck.
No biggie.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.540
That's not a spider.

06:53.570 --> 06:54.710
That's a birthmark.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.710
Ahhh! Birthmark!

07:00.640 --> 07:03.380
<i>Okay, I'll leave</i>
<i>a note for new kid.</i>

07:03.410 --> 07:04.680
<i>"I think you're cute.</i>

07:04.720 --> 07:06.520
<i>"do you think I'm cute?</i>

07:06.550 --> 07:08.320
<i>"check 'yes' or 'no.'</i>

07:08.350 --> 07:10.690
<i>"chyna, locker 112."</i>

07:10.720 --> 07:15.330
<i>And third locker</i>
<i>from the left.</i>

07:18.530 --> 07:19.630
<i>Oh, no!</i>

07:19.670 --> 07:21.470
<i>Wrong locker.</i>

07:28.810 --> 07:31.480
Ooh! A note.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.800
No?

07:50.600 --> 07:53.570
You know, you're no prize, either!

07:53.600 --> 07:55.840
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

07:59.470 --> 08:00.640
Hello, fletcher.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.540
It's me, principal skidmore.

08:03.580 --> 08:06.280
Yeah, I know.

08:06.310 --> 08:09.450
You probably didn't recognize
me because I had my hair done.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.420
At a new, hip salon,

08:11.450 --> 08:14.360
And look much younger.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.730
No, I recognize you.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.490
Why don't you take a seat and we'll
get started on your portraits.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.440
It's really an honor for you to
choose me to paint your... Ahhh!

08:32.510 --> 08:34.539
So, how do I look?

08:35.740 --> 08:37.539
Stunning.

08:37.580 --> 08:40.610
I am genuinely stunned.

08:41.580 --> 08:42.650
So,

08:42.679 --> 08:44.420
Shall I strike a pose?

08:44.450 --> 08:46.420
Uh...

08:46.690 --> 08:48.450
You know,

08:48.490 --> 08:50.460
I've looked at some of the other.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.490
Former principals'
portraits in the hallway,

08:52.520 --> 08:55.460
And, well, they're a little bit more, um...

08:55.830 --> 08:56.830
Academic.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.560
Oh, this is academic.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.730
I'm wearing a schoolgirl's outfit.

09:01.770 --> 09:04.800
Oh, and the portrait
is not for the hallway.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.470
It's a birthday present
for my "gentleman friend,"

09:09.480 --> 09:14.280
Dashing city councilman ted taggart.

09:14.310 --> 09:15.680
"dashing," as in running away?

09:20.420 --> 09:25.390
So, I've decided to tell new kid how I
feel about him by writing him a song.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.360
<i>♪ hey, new kid,</i>
<i>I think you're cute</i>

09:29.390 --> 09:31.430
<i>♪ but when I'm around</i>
<i>you, I go mute</i>

09:31.460 --> 09:33.730
<i>♪ so I'll have to tell</i>
<i>you with my flute ♪</i>

09:44.510 --> 09:48.410
You know, I'd try something a
little bit less, um, spitty.

09:54.350 --> 09:55.790
What the heck?

09:57.790 --> 09:59.660
Something wrong, olive?

09:59.690 --> 10:00.760
Look!

10:01.460 --> 10:02.760
Uh-oh.

10:02.790 --> 10:06.630
Is that g-g-ghost ectoplasm
all over your locker?

10:09.460 --> 10:13.470
Wasn't "ghost" on the list of
things you were afraid of?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.800
It was on the list, right?

10:16.740 --> 10:18.470
Yeah, but...

10:18.510 --> 10:20.540
This looks like jelly.
It's not jelly.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.340
Smells like jelly.
It's not jelly.

10:23.380 --> 10:25.710
Tastes like jelly.
It's not jelly!

10:30.450 --> 10:31.590
"go away?"

10:31.620 --> 10:33.690
And it's written in blood!

10:35.420 --> 10:39.530
Looks like ketchup.
It's not ketchup!

10:39.560 --> 10:43.360
Haven't you heard the legend
of the haunted locker?

10:43.400 --> 10:44.670
Haunted locker?

10:44.700 --> 10:48.540
They say this locker was built
on an ancient burial ground.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.470
Only my locker?

10:52.740 --> 10:57.480
It's a very small ancient burial ground.

10:58.510 --> 11:00.510
Throughout all the years,

11:00.550 --> 11:04.620
Whoever had this locker was cursed!

11:04.650 --> 11:07.690
I haven't been this scared since st.
Patrick's day.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.590
Leprechauns everywhere!

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
Ahhh! Ahhh! Oh!

11:15.530 --> 11:17.730
Did you feel that?
I did!

11:17.770 --> 11:19.740
It was the cold chill of a ghost.

11:19.770 --> 11:20.800
Breathing on our necks.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.670
Ghost germs!

11:22.710 --> 11:24.370
Where are you going?

11:24.410 --> 11:25.670
Come back, locker neighbor!

11:25.710 --> 11:29.580
Don't leave me alone
with the g-g-g-ghost!

11:31.580 --> 11:33.520
Self-five.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.640
Hi, chyna.

11:40.670 --> 11:41.940
Can I keep my lunch in your locker?

11:42.840 --> 11:44.670
Why?
Well,

11:44.710 --> 11:46.710
You've got that air-conditioning
vent right there,

11:46.740 --> 11:48.710
And it might help keep it from spoiling.

11:48.740 --> 11:52.810
You know, botulism is the silent killer.

11:52.850 --> 11:56.520
Well, botulism and carbon monoxide.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.720
And heart disease.

11:58.850 --> 12:00.550
And obviously ninjas.

12:03.930 --> 12:07.630
Uh, this looks like more than your lunch.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.870
Did you bring everything from your locker?

12:09.900 --> 12:13.570
No. I didn't
bring the ghost.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.540
Turns out my locker is haunted.

12:15.940 --> 12:17.670
Olive,

12:17.710 --> 12:20.740
Were you outside again when
those school buses were idling?

12:21.610 --> 12:22.850
No.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.780
Cameron told me about the
legend of the haunted locker.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.620
Olive?

12:27.650 --> 12:29.720
I think cameron made that
up to get rid of you.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.750
What?
That makes no sense.

12:31.790 --> 12:34.520
I mean, why would cameron
try to get rid of me?

12:34.560 --> 12:36.560
I'm delightful.

12:37.660 --> 12:39.500
The only logical explanation.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.700
Is that there is a very tiny
burial ground under my locker.

12:42.730 --> 12:46.970
And the disturbed spirits of the undead
are wreaking their unholy vengeance.

12:48.910 --> 12:51.880
Ahhh!

12:51.910 --> 12:54.880
What's wrong?
Did you see a ghost?

12:55.680 --> 12:56.710
Worse.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.820
Disorganization.

13:06.730 --> 13:08.590
Ew.

13:08.630 --> 13:11.460
I'm done.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.800
Let me see the masterpiece.

13:17.740 --> 13:19.710
Who's that?

13:19.740 --> 13:21.610
That's you.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.610
Uh, where is my beautiful, milky white skin?
Where is that youthful glow?

13:25.650 --> 13:27.880
Have you checked 1972?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.680
This looks nothing like me.

13:32.590 --> 13:33.850
It doesn't?
Mmm-mmm.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.660
How about this one?

13:39.660 --> 13:41.930
No!
Who is this?

13:41.960 --> 13:43.930
Why do you keep painting this old lady?

13:49.900 --> 13:52.610
Olive, what did you do to my locker?

13:52.640 --> 13:55.740
I rearranged everything into a
perfect, alphabetical filing system,

13:55.780 --> 13:58.980
And made everything so much easier to find.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.980
Well, I couldn't
find my fruit roll-up.

14:01.010 --> 14:02.680
Where'd you look?

14:02.720 --> 14:03.780
Under "f."

14:03.820 --> 14:05.480
That was your mistake.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.790
I filed it under "r"
for roll-up, comma, fruit.

14:09.820 --> 14:13.660
I assumed you'd want all your different
kinds of roll-ups in the same place.

14:13.690 --> 14:16.490
They only make
fruit roll-ups.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.830
For now.

14:18.860 --> 14:21.700
But in the future, when
scientists invent meat roll-ups,

14:21.730 --> 14:24.870
You'll be able to find them
right there under "r."

14:26.600 --> 14:27.700
Okay.

14:27.740 --> 14:28.870
I'll go look
under "r."

14:28.910 --> 14:31.740
Uh, don't bother, I ate it.

14:37.650 --> 14:38.780
Chyna,

14:38.810 --> 14:40.650
I'm desperate.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.680
I can't paint skidmore again.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.720
Slam this locker door on my hand.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.520
Okay.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.760
What are you doing?

14:48.790 --> 14:54.560
You're supposed to tell me that
breaking my fingers isn't the answer.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.530
No, I honestly think that
this is your best option.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.570
Stop that!

15:00.600 --> 15:03.910
How can I possibly make
skidmore look beautiful?

15:05.510 --> 15:07.640
Well, everyone has inner beauty.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.850
So, just don't paint what's on the outside.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.920
Paint what's on the inside.

15:11.950 --> 15:17.760
Oh. You know, you could have told me
that before you tried to cripple me!

15:17.790 --> 15:20.590
I'm sorry, I'm just in a really bad mood.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.790
I mean, olive is driving me crazy.

15:22.830 --> 15:25.500
You have no idea what I've
been through this week.

15:35.540 --> 15:37.640
That's the guy you're madly in love with?

15:39.740 --> 15:41.740
He's way out of your league.

15:41.780 --> 15:43.950
He's even out of my league.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.790
Don't you knock?
Sheesh!

15:57.660 --> 15:59.630
Hey, why don't you spend
the night in the locker?

15:59.660 --> 16:02.630
By morning, she'll see it isn't haunted.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.640
You know what? That is what they
do in those haunted house movies.

16:06.670 --> 16:09.500
Although, everyone usually ends
up with an axe in their head.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.440
But, then again,

16:12.480 --> 16:14.880
That can't be any more painful
than sharing a locker with olive.

16:14.910 --> 16:16.680
So, uh...

16:16.710 --> 16:17.780
Good plan!

16:17.810 --> 16:19.450
Oh, one problem.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.680
Olive would never agree to
come to the school at night.

16:21.720 --> 16:22.920
If she knew what you were planning.

16:22.950 --> 16:25.590
Don't worry, I have an idea.

16:28.930 --> 16:31.660
Am I getting close to the donkey?

16:32.960 --> 16:34.560
You're almost there.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.830
Wow, your house is huge!

16:37.870 --> 16:41.570
I feel like I've been walking
for, like, 12 blocks.

16:44.710 --> 16:45.870
Ahhh!

16:47.640 --> 16:48.980
Surprise!

16:56.230 --> 16:57.560
No! No!
No! No! No!

16:57.600 --> 17:00.500
There is no way I'm spending
the night in a haunted locker.

17:00.530 --> 17:05.200
Oh, come on. There's a pinata in here,
full of all your favorite candy.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.339
Fine, hand me the stick.

17:08.510 --> 17:11.180
Okay, there's no pinata.

17:11.210 --> 17:13.310
But you need to face
your fears, so come on.

17:16.550 --> 17:17.550
Ugh.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.190
There, see?

17:22.220 --> 17:24.119
It's nothing to be afraid of!

17:24.160 --> 17:26.490
And by morning, you'll see
that there are no ghosts.

17:26.530 --> 17:28.290
Well, what are we going to do until then?

17:28.329 --> 17:29.460
Uh...

17:29.500 --> 17:31.100
We could play some games!

17:31.130 --> 17:32.430
Ooh! How
about tag?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.140
You're it.

17:35.170 --> 17:37.540
You're it.
No, you're it.

17:37.570 --> 17:40.270
You're it! You're it!
You're it!

17:40.310 --> 17:41.410
Okay, this is so stupid.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.510
Totally.
But I won.

17:46.220 --> 17:48.350
Okay, let's play another game.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.250
Hide and seek.

17:50.290 --> 17:51.290
I'll hide.

17:52.450 --> 17:57.260
One, two, three,

17:57.290 --> 18:02.360
Four, five, six...

18:02.400 --> 18:04.300
<i>ooh!</i>

18:05.100 --> 18:06.370
What was that?

18:06.400 --> 18:08.400
I don't know.

18:08.440 --> 18:09.470
You don't think it was a...

18:09.510 --> 18:12.370
<i>Ooh!</i>

18:14.140 --> 18:17.080
Um, maybe it's just the wind.

18:17.110 --> 18:19.410
<i>It's not the wind.</i>

18:19.450 --> 18:21.520
He says it's not the wind!

18:23.390 --> 18:25.150
Ghost!

18:25.190 --> 18:28.290
Take olive!
It's her locker!

18:28.320 --> 18:30.390
I want you out of me locker, lassies.

18:30.430 --> 18:32.330
That's where I keep me pot of gold.

18:32.360 --> 18:36.260
It's worse than I thought!
The ghost is a leprechaun!

18:36.300 --> 18:39.070
We're so sorry!
Please don't hurt us!

18:39.100 --> 18:40.400
It's a wee too late for sorry.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.540
How dare you defecate me grave?

18:43.270 --> 18:44.570
Wait.

18:44.610 --> 18:48.110
Does he mean "desecrate"?
Because "defecate" means poop.

18:48.140 --> 18:50.380
I definitely didn't do that to his grave.

18:50.410 --> 18:54.450
But I did pee a little when I
found out he's a leprechaun.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.450
Leave here and never return,

18:56.490 --> 19:00.190
Or I will torment you
with a merry irish jig.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.230
Wait a minute.

19:08.270 --> 19:11.170
I think this ghost sounds
a little familiar.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.100
He's not even tall enough
to be a leprechaun.

19:14.140 --> 19:19.110
Ow! Ow!
I mean, owoooh!

19:19.140 --> 19:21.250
Ahhh! Ghost!
Ghost!

19:21.280 --> 19:22.350
Olive, it's cameron.

19:22.380 --> 19:26.220
Oh, I'm not cameron,
I'm a leprechaun ghost.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.120
Cameron, the jig is up.

19:33.260 --> 19:35.390
I'm serious.
Stop doing the jig.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.160
This isn't even a pot of gold.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.370
It's a pot of curly fries.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.130
Ahhh!
Curly fries!

19:42.170 --> 19:46.340
Why are they curly?
It's unnatural!

19:50.440 --> 19:52.180
You guys were so scared,

19:52.210 --> 19:55.250
I'm surprised you didn't
desecrate in your pants.

19:55.280 --> 19:59.350
You know, you're taking those
sats in, like, two weeks, right?

20:00.190 --> 20:02.150
Oh, by the way,

20:02.190 --> 20:03.520
How'd you even know we'd be here?

20:03.550 --> 20:07.090
I overheard you talking to fletcher
when I was in the bathroom.

20:07.120 --> 20:10.390
We were outside the girls' bathroom.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.440
It smells better.

20:24.480 --> 20:28.110
At least, it did before I used it.

20:28.150 --> 20:31.350
Well, it's still not nice to
scare people for no reason.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.220
Oh, I had a reason.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.790
You're the most annoying
locker neighbor ever.

20:36.470 --> 20:37.600
Annoying?

20:38.090 --> 20:41.400
Well I'll share a locker with Chyna.
And she loves having me, right Chyna?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.500
Uhh...

20:44.040 --> 20:45.070
Totally.

20:45.350 --> 20:48.940
I mean... It's too bad you're moving back into your old locker.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.940
You are moving back, right?

20:53.500 --> 20:55.380
Wait. You think I'm annoying too?

20:57.100 --> 20:59.950
You're missing the big picture.
The school's not haunted.

21:00.280 --> 21:01.890
Help! Help!

21:02.550 --> 21:04.970
Don't look. It's too horrible.

21:11.790 --> 21:13.360
The walking dead.

21:13.650 --> 21:16.370
It's the school girl who died
hundreds of years ago.

21:16.370 --> 21:19.120
Look at how her body is decayed.

21:19.450 --> 21:21.100
Fletcher!

21:21.100 --> 21:24.200
You need to answer for this.

21:25.770 --> 21:27.040
Don't blame me.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.980
Chyna told me to paint what's
on the inside.

21:30.650 --> 21:32.860
I didn't mean her skeleton.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.740
But the good news is you do look skinny.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.710
Ah?

21:39.580 --> 21:41.350
Oh... I do it, don't I?

21:45.180 --> 21:46.410
There she is.

21:46.410 --> 21:47.890
New girl.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.890
She's so cute.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.890
I wonder if she interested in me.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.610
I mean... She has been staring at me for like an hour.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.900
It's time to make my move.

22:05.760 --> 22:06.810
Now...

22:06.810 --> 22:09.110
What do you say to a babe like that?

22:09.110 --> 22:11.350
How about "Hey, toots"?

22:11.350 --> 22:15.970
Let's say, "Let me take you to San Francisco's
newest hotspot?

22:16.190 --> 22:20.180
Cause there's an unsecured wireless network
at the bus station."

22:21.870 --> 22:24.560
Oh that's lame. Stupid.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.800
Seriously. What did I do?
