(thunder crashes)

00:03.128 --> 00:05.130
♪♪

00:13.096 --> 00:15.348
(ghostly shriek)

00:18.518 --> 00:20.437
(evil laughter)

00:22.147 --> 00:23.523
(gunfire)

00:25.191 --> 00:26.985
(all moaning)

00:38.955 --> 00:40.915
Paintings:

00:40.999 --> 00:44.502
Lifeless images rendered
in colorful goop.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.339
But at night, they take on
a life of their own.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.050
They become portals to hell...

00:50.133 --> 00:52.093
so scary and horrible
and gruesome that--

00:52.177 --> 00:55.221
Bart, you should warn people
this episode is very frightening.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.890
Maybe they'd rather listen to that old

00:56.973 --> 00:58.975
"War of the Worlds" broadcast
on N.P.R., hmm?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.269
-Yes, Mother.
-Good.

01:01.352 --> 01:04.773
Now, you hold Maggie. I'm going to
buy some earrings at the gift shop.

01:04.856 --> 01:09.444
(sighs) The subject of our first painting
tonight is the most...

01:09.527 --> 01:13.281
foul, evil, vicious,
diabolical beast to stalk the earth.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.408
Of course,
I refer to--

01:15.492 --> 01:17.202
(muffled)

01:18.703 --> 01:20.830
The devil.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.339
And next in our fall catalog--
we love this--

01:29.422 --> 01:32.342
it is a vision
in raspberry cream.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.844
(applause)

01:34.928 --> 01:38.598
Ohh! Pure genius.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.476
(gurgling)

01:41.559 --> 01:46.397
Oh! And now to make the leap
from dreams to reality.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.982
-(shrieks)
-Sorry, Homer.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.276
While you were daydreaming,
we ate all the doughnuts.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.238
Well, there were a few left, but we
chucked 'em at an old man for kicks.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.866
Damn buzzards!
I ain't dead yet!

01:58.535 --> 02:01.121
All right. Stay calm.
Remember your training.

02:04.415 --> 02:08.461
"Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency
doughnut. Signed, Homer."

02:08.545 --> 02:11.339
Bastard! He's always
one step ahead.

02:11.422 --> 02:14.509
Oh! I'd sell my soul
for a doughnut!

02:14.592 --> 02:17.387
-(rumbling)
-Well, that can be arranged.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.515
Flanders!
You're the devil?

02:20.598 --> 02:23.351
(chuckles) It's always
the one you least suspect.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.478
Now, many people offer
to sell their souls...

02:25.562 --> 02:28.106
without reflecting upon
the grave ramifica--

02:28.189 --> 02:30.733
-Do you have a doughnut or not?
-Coming up.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.027
Just sign here.
Careful, hot pen.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.867
Hmm. Who's that goat-legged fellow?
I like the cut of his jib.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.161
Uh, Prince of Darkness, sir.
He's your 11:00.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.292
(gasps)
Ah!

02:47.375 --> 02:50.837
Now, remember, the instant
you finish it, I own your soul for--

02:53.006 --> 02:55.466
Hey, wait, if I don't
finish this last bite,

02:55.550 --> 02:58.136
you don't get
my soul, do you?

02:58.219 --> 02:59.304
Uh, technically no, but---

02:59.387 --> 03:02.599
I'm smarter than the devil!
I'm smarter than the dev--

03:02.682 --> 03:05.602
You are not smarter than me!

03:05.685 --> 03:09.355
I'll see you in hell yet,
Homer Simpson!

03:11.858 --> 03:14.444
Not likely.
(chuckles)

03:17.780 --> 03:20.158
(muttering)

03:20.241 --> 03:22.619
Hm. Hm. Hm.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.913
Mmm!

03:24.996 --> 03:28.875
Mmm! Forbidden doughnut.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.962
-Hmm?
-Well, well. Finishing something?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.006
(screams)

03:35.089 --> 03:36.966
(whimpering)

03:39.886 --> 03:41.429
(gasps)

03:41.512 --> 03:43.306
-Homer, did you eat that doughnut?
-No.

03:46.434 --> 03:50.021
Your wide behind won't
save you this time. Hey, Bart.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.689
-Hey.
-Wait!

03:51.773 --> 03:54.067
Doesn't my father have
the right to a fair trial?

03:54.150 --> 03:57.946
Oh, you Americans with your
"due process" And "fair trials."

03:58.029 --> 04:02.033
This is always so much easier
in Mexico. All right. Very well.

04:02.116 --> 04:05.536
We'll have the trial tomorrow
at the stroke of midnight.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.665
Till then, you're going to
spend the day in hell!

04:12.210 --> 04:15.421
(screaming)

04:19.509 --> 04:21.219
(sighs)
That wasn't so bad.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.179
Huh? Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:30.853 --> 04:33.439
So, you like doughnuts, eh?

04:33.523 --> 04:35.441
-Uh-huh.
-Well,

04:35.525 --> 04:38.111
have all the doughnuts
in the world!

04:38.194 --> 04:40.113
(cackling)

04:49.998 --> 04:52.834
More. Mmm!

04:52.917 --> 04:56.963
I don't understand it.
James Coco went mad in 15 minutes.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.591
(chiming)

05:00.675 --> 05:02.260
(yowls)

05:03.594 --> 05:04.846
Ooh!

05:04.929 --> 05:07.098
-Homer, are you all right?
-No.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.808
Mr. Simpson, don't you worry.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.185
I watched <i>Matlock</i> in a bar
last night.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.104
The sound wasn't on,
but I think I got the gist of it.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.488
Hear ye! Hear ye!

05:22.572 --> 05:26.200
The Court of Infernal Affairs
is now in session.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.494
Very well. But first,
some ground rules.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.080
Number one:
We get bathroom breaks every half hour.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.292
Agreed. Number two:
The jury will be chosen by me.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.085
Agreed.
No, wait!

05:36.169 --> 05:40.423
Silence! I give you
the jury of the damned!

05:40.506 --> 05:44.594
Benedict Arnold.
Lizzie Borden. Richard Nixon.

05:44.677 --> 05:48.389
But I'm not dead yet. In fact,
I just wrote an article for <i>Redbook.</i>

05:48.473 --> 05:51.059
-Hey, listen, I did a favor for you.
-Yes, master.

05:51.142 --> 05:55.021
John Wilkes booth.
Blackbeard the Pirate. John Dillinger.

05:55.104 --> 05:58.691
And the starting line of
the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.402
-(gasps)
-(chattering)

06:08.743 --> 06:13.039
I'm sorry, Mr. Blackbeard. We're low
on chairs, and this is the last one.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.667
Arr! This chair be high, says I.

06:16.751 --> 06:22.632
(clears throat) I hold here a contract
between myself and one Homer Simpson,

06:22.715 --> 06:25.718
pledging me his soul
for a doughnut!

06:25.802 --> 06:30.556
Which I delivered!
And it was scrum-didilly-umptious.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.434
I simply ask
for what is mine.

06:33.518 --> 06:37.897
-(murmuring)
-That was a right pretty speech, sir.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.774
But I ask you,
what is a contract?

06:39.857 --> 06:41.859
Webster's defines it as

06:41.943 --> 06:44.028
"An agreement under the law
which is unbreakable."

06:44.112 --> 06:46.739
"Which is unbreakable"!

06:49.409 --> 06:51.619
Excuse me.
I must use the restroom.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.331
(door slams)

06:56.457 --> 06:58.918
Uh, Mr. Hutz?

07:02.046 --> 07:05.883
Homer Simpson,
I have no choice...

07:05.967 --> 07:08.719
but to sentence you
to an eternity of--

07:08.803 --> 07:11.764
Wait! Before you send him to hell,
there's something you should see.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.017
That's a photo of Homer
and me at our wedding.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.938
Wait a minute. You got married
in an emergency room?

07:19.021 --> 07:21.774
Well, Homer ate the entire
wedding cake by himself...

07:21.858 --> 07:23.776
before the wedding.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.779
(laughter)

07:26.863 --> 07:28.739
Read the back!
The back!

07:28.823 --> 07:32.452
Arr. 'tis some kind
of treasure map.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.997
-You idiot, you can't read.
-Aye, 'tis true.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.833
My debauchery was
my way of compensatin'.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.794
"Dear Marge, you have
given me your hand in marriage.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.214
"All I can give you
in return is my soul,

07:45.298 --> 07:47.675
which I pledge
to you forever."

07:47.758 --> 07:50.344
(murmuring)

07:50.428 --> 07:52.430
We've heard enough.
Your Honor,

07:52.513 --> 07:55.141
we find that Homer Simpson's soul
is legally the property...

07:55.224 --> 07:57.143
of Marge Simpson
and not of the devil.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.978
(groans)

07:59.061 --> 08:01.439
-Yea!
-Whoo-hoo-- Ow!

08:03.524 --> 08:06.611
All right, Simpson.
You get your soul back.

08:06.694 --> 08:11.824
But let that ill-gotten doughnut
be forever on your head.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.702
(Homer screams)

08:17.663 --> 08:19.540
(Homer chewing)

08:22.835 --> 08:24.754
-Homer, stop picking at it.
-Oh!

08:24.837 --> 08:27.381
But I'm so sweet and tasty.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.383
(sighs)
Well, time to go to work.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.636
Dad, I wouldn't
go outside if I were you.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.555
Don't worry, boys. He's gotta
come out of there sometime.

08:37.558 --> 08:41.395
The next exhibit in our
ghoulish gallery is entitled--

08:41.479 --> 08:43.564
the "School Bus"?

08:43.648 --> 08:47.360
Oh! Oh! They must
mean the "Ghoul Bus."

08:47.443 --> 08:50.196
Nope. It says right there,
"School bus."

08:50.279 --> 08:53.658
Well, there's nothing scarier
than having to go to school.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.454
(sighs)

09:07.171 --> 09:10.132
Hey, Bart, look!
Krusty trading cards!

09:10.216 --> 09:13.469
The long-awaited
eighth series!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.805
BART: "Krusty visits relatives
in Annapolis, Maryland."

09:15.888 --> 09:18.808
"Krusty poses for trading
card photo."

09:18.891 --> 09:23.187
Hmm. He seems to be running
a little low on ideas.

09:23.271 --> 09:27.400
-Well, at least you got the gum.
-Oww! I cut my cheek!

09:29.610 --> 09:31.821
Whoa! Whoa!

09:31.904 --> 09:34.615
-(screaming)
-(horn blaring)

09:34.699 --> 09:35.950
(screaming)

09:37.577 --> 09:39.120
Oh--
I hope this is sweat.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.789
Bart, what's wrong?

09:41.872 --> 09:46.586
I just had a vision of
my own horrible, fiery death.

09:46.669 --> 09:47.670
And?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.089
Lisa, your brother's
obviously had a nightmare.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.174
Don't worry, honey.
The scary part's over.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.260
(horn blaring)

09:54.343 --> 09:57.263
Marge, look at all this great stuff
I found at the marina!

09:57.346 --> 09:59.473
It was just sitting
in some guy's boat.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.474
-(horn blaring)
-Aah!

10:02.143 --> 10:04.645
-(gasp)
-Hello, Simpson.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.897
I'm riding the bus because
Mother hid my car keys

10:06.981 --> 10:09.191
to punish me for talking
to a woman on the phone.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.276
She was right to do it.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.321
Excuse me.
Bart's a little upset this morning,

10:13.404 --> 10:15.781
so could everyone please
be extra-nice to him?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.908
(all laughing)

10:17.992 --> 10:21.203
Hey, where's
your diaper, baby?

10:21.287 --> 10:24.582
Thank goodness he's drawn
attention away from my shirt.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.253
(groaning)

10:36.302 --> 10:38.471
(snarling)

10:38.554 --> 10:40.890
(gasps) Milhouse!
Milhouse, wake up.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.726
-Quick, look out the window.
-No way, Bart.

10:43.809 --> 10:48.230
If I lean over, I leave myself open
to wedgies, wet willies,

10:48.314 --> 10:50.191
or even the dreaded
rear admiral.

10:50.274 --> 10:53.778
-(grunts)
-Otto, you gotta do something!

10:53.861 --> 10:55.655
There's a gremlin
on the side of the bus!

10:58.449 --> 11:01.410
Hey, <i>no problemo,</i> Bart-dude.
I'll get rid of it.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.998
No! Oh, no.
I just made my last payment.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.126
Oh.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.512
(screams)
Everybody!

11:19.595 --> 11:21.597
There's a monster
on the side of the bus!

11:21.681 --> 11:23.599
(yelling)

11:23.683 --> 11:27.186
Hey, there's no monster.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.064
-You're deceptive.
-I don't see anything.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.817
Hey, who's
driving the bus?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.777
Ooh!
<i>Una momento, por favor.</i>

11:36.237 --> 11:38.030
Foolish earthlings.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.908
Frightened of a creature
that does not exist.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.994
(laughing loudly)

11:47.123 --> 11:49.500
(grunting)

11:49.583 --> 11:51.627
-(gasps)
-(groans)

11:54.130 --> 11:56.882
Now, I've gotten word that
a child is using his imagination,

11:56.966 --> 11:58.551
and I've come
to put a stop to it.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.511
No! No, it's true!
There's a monster on the bus.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.388
The only monster on this bus

12:02.471 --> 12:04.807
is a lack of proper respect
for the rules.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.225
Oh!

12:08.561 --> 12:10.312
(groaning)

12:14.483 --> 12:17.194
(screaming)

12:17.278 --> 12:19.613
Ach. Me mule wouldn't
walk in the mud.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.866
So I had to put
17 bullets in him.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.661
(groaning)

12:25.745 --> 12:28.664
You believe me, don't you?
You're my friend who believes me.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.333
Sweet, trustworthy
Milhouse.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.420
Actually, Bart, you're kinda
creepin' me out.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.672
Uh, I think
I'm gonna go sit, uh,

12:36.756 --> 12:40.050
w-with that
foreign exchange student.

12:40.134 --> 12:44.805
Oh, <i>guten tag! </i>Would you care for
a bite of my <i>vengelerstrasse</i> bar?

12:44.889 --> 12:47.141
I also have a bag
of marzipan joyjoys!

12:59.737 --> 13:01.614
The gremlin's takin'
off the wheel!

13:01.697 --> 13:04.533
Stop the bus or we're
all gonna die! Aaah!

13:04.617 --> 13:07.495
Take me bridle and lash
his hands to the seat!

13:10.790 --> 13:13.918
Would you like another
lick of my flavor wax?

13:14.001 --> 13:15.878
Uh, sure.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.632
Well, now that
we're friends, <i>Uter,</i>

13:19.715 --> 13:21.884
how 'bout loosening
these straps, huh?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.844
<i>Ja, das ist gut.</i>

13:31.977 --> 13:33.854
(groans)

13:42.029 --> 13:44.782
(screaming)

13:44.865 --> 13:47.284
(all screaming)

13:47.368 --> 13:50.955
-(screaming)
-(gasps)

13:51.038 --> 13:53.499
-(growling)
-(grunting)

13:53.582 --> 13:55.543
-Hey, boy!
-(horn blaring)

13:59.588 --> 14:02.258
Pull, Willie! Pull!

14:02.341 --> 14:05.719
I'm doin' all the pullin',
ya blouse-wearin' poodle walker!

14:16.605 --> 14:20.317
Oh, Dear Lord!
It's some sort of hideous monster.

14:23.070 --> 14:26.115
Aw, isn't that cute?
He's trying to claw my eyes out.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.207
Whoa!

14:35.291 --> 14:37.209
Gadzooks!

14:37.293 --> 14:39.795
Look at the bus! I was right,
I tell ya! I was right!

14:39.879 --> 14:42.840
Right or wrong, your behavior
was still disruptive, young man.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.551
Perhaps spending the remainder
of your life in a madhouse...

14:45.634 --> 14:47.970
-will teach you some manners.
-Ha-ha!

14:52.308 --> 14:55.436
(sighs) At least now
I can get some rest.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.398
Hidilly-ho, Bart!

14:59.481 --> 15:01.817
(screams)

15:05.863 --> 15:10.618
We come now to the final and most
terrifying painting of the evening.

15:10.701 --> 15:14.830
To even gaze upon it
is to go mad.

15:14.914 --> 15:19.960
(shrieks) They're dogs,
and they're playing poker!

15:20.044 --> 15:22.296
Aaah!
(crazed laughter)

15:25.507 --> 15:30.220
We had a story to go with this painting,
but it was far too intense.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.723
So we just threw something
together with vampires. Enjoy!

15:36.393 --> 15:39.063
KENT BROCKMAN (on TV):<i> Another</i>
<i>local peasant has been found dead,</i>

15:39.146 --> 15:42.107
<i>drained of his blood, with</i>
<i>two teeth marks on his throat.</i>

15:42.191 --> 15:46.946
<i>This black cape was found</i>
<i>on the scene. Police are baffled.</i>

15:47.029 --> 15:49.823
<i>We think we're dealing</i>
<i>with a supernatural being,</i>

15:49.907 --> 15:51.659
<i>most likely a mummy.</i>

15:51.742 --> 15:53.577
<i>As a precaution,</i>
<i>I've ordered</i>

15:53.661 --> 15:57.623
<i>the Egyptian wing of the</i>
<i>Springfield Museum destroyed.</i>

15:57.706 --> 15:59.541
<i>Nice work, Ed.</i>

15:59.625 --> 16:01.335
No, no, they're wrong!

16:01.418 --> 16:04.088
The creature they seek
is the walking undead.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.465
Nosferatu.
Das vampyr.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.636
A vampire!

16:10.719 --> 16:14.848
(chuckles) Lisa,
vampires are make-believe.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.434
Just like elves,
gremlins and Eskimos.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.103
<i>In a completely unrelated</i>
<i>story,</i>

16:19.186 --> 16:20.646
<i>Montgomery Burns</i>
<i>has just closed a deal...</i>

16:20.729 --> 16:22.564
<i>to buy the Springfield</i>
<i>Blood Bank.</i>

16:22.648 --> 16:26.110
<i>Oh, I'm very excited</i>
<i>about this deal.</i>

16:26.193 --> 16:29.571
<i>What? Oh.</i>
<i>Precious blood.</i>

16:29.655 --> 16:31.365
Hmm. Business deal.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.953
It sure was nice of
Mr. Burns to invite us...

16:36.036 --> 16:38.664
for a midnight dinner
at his country house in...

16:38.747 --> 16:40.499
Pennsylvania.

16:40.582 --> 16:43.293
(thunderclap)

16:43.377 --> 16:45.587
Ah, there's something fishy
about this whole setup.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.132
Lisa, stop being
so suspicious.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.509
Did everyone wash their necks
like Mr. Burns asked?

16:50.592 --> 16:52.761
-Yes.
-Sure did.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.977
-(doorbell chimes)
-BURNS (over speaker): <i>Welcome. Come in.</i>

17:00.060 --> 17:02.938
<i>Ah, fresh victims for my</i>
<i>ever-growing army of the undead.</i>

17:03.022 --> 17:04.690
SMITHERS: <i>Sir, you have</i>
<i>to let go of the button.</i>

17:04.773 --> 17:06.483
BURNS: <i>Oh, son of a bit--</i>

17:15.075 --> 17:17.453
Well, if it isn't
my good friends, the, uh--

17:17.536 --> 17:21.081
-Simpson family, Master.
-Simpson, eh? Excellent.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.170
Dad, do you notice
anything strange?

17:26.253 --> 17:28.213
Yeah, his hairdo
looks so queer.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.758
-I heard that!
-It was the boy!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.594
(gasps)
Ooh! Punch!

17:33.677 --> 17:36.513
Eww. Dad, this is blood.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.807
Correction-- free blood.

17:41.268 --> 17:44.521
Whoops. Bart and I
have to go wash up.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.483
But you didn't get any
on me-- ugh-- wh--

17:47.566 --> 17:49.818
Lisa, Burns isn't a vampire.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.614
And even if he was, we're not gonna
stumble on his secret hiding place.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.787
You're probably right.
Let's just go back. (gasps)

18:03.165 --> 18:05.667
-Satisfied?
-Big deal.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.212
It's no different from the basement
in Grampa's rest home.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.671
Look!
(gasps)

18:12.925 --> 18:14.927
Oh, my God!

18:17.387 --> 18:19.098
(stammering)

18:19.181 --> 18:21.642
Please, Bart.
I've seen your stupid Shemp.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.855
Nyung, nyung,
nyung, nyung!

18:26.939 --> 18:29.608
Yeah, I've seen
your Curly too.

18:29.691 --> 18:33.112
-(growls)
-(screams)

18:38.200 --> 18:41.537
I know I really shouldn't,
but when am I gonna be here again?

18:41.620 --> 18:44.873
Whee!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.543
-(growling)
-(screaming)

18:51.130 --> 18:53.674
Well, if it isn't little...

18:53.757 --> 18:55.634
uh, boy.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.221
(screaming)

18:59.304 --> 19:03.892
Mom, Dad! Mr. Burns is
a vampire, and he has Bart!

19:03.976 --> 19:05.978
BURNS:
Why, Bart is right here.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.939
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Father.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.525
I missed you during
my uneventful absence.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.944
Oh, Lisa,
you and your stories.

19:14.027 --> 19:17.156
"Bart is a vampire."
"Beer kills brain cells."

19:17.239 --> 19:19.074
Now, let's go back
to that

19:19.158 --> 19:21.160
building thingy

19:21.243 --> 19:23.620
where our beds and TV is.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.125
(muttering)

19:28.208 --> 19:30.460
(tapping)

19:31.587 --> 19:33.714
(screaming)

19:33.797 --> 19:37.134
Come join us, Lisa.
It's so cool.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.470
You get to stay up
all night drinking blood.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.389
And if you say
you're a vampire,

19:42.472 --> 19:44.892
you get a free small soda
at the movies.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.852
No! No!

19:46.935 --> 19:50.397
Lisa, it's not like
you have a choice here.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.735
(screams)

19:54.818 --> 19:57.696
Bart! How many times have
I told you not to bite your sist--

19:57.779 --> 20:00.199
(gasps) Wait a minute!
You are a vampire!

20:00.282 --> 20:02.868
Quick!
We have to kill the boy!

20:02.951 --> 20:04.912
How'd you know
he's a vampire?

20:04.995 --> 20:07.080
He's a vampire?
Aaah!

20:07.164 --> 20:09.708
(cackling)

20:09.791 --> 20:12.586
Homer, we gotta do something.
Today, he's drinking people's blood.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.588
Tomorrow,
he could be smoking.

20:14.671 --> 20:17.925
The only way to get Bart back
is to kill the head vampire,

20:18.008 --> 20:19.927
Mr. Burns.

20:20.010 --> 20:23.472
Kill my boss? Do I dare
live out the American dream?

20:25.098 --> 20:26.725
This is dangerous.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.560
I wish we could have
found a sitter for Maggie.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.812
(gasps)
Super Fun Happy Slide!

20:30.896 --> 20:33.649
-No, Dad.
-Oh! I guess killing will be fun enough.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.946
You must drive this stake
right through his heart.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.162
Take that, vile fiend!

20:50.123 --> 20:52.167
Uh, Dad,
that's his crotch.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.127
(laughs)
Oh, sorry.

20:56.713 --> 21:01.301
-(screaming) No!
-(groaning)

21:04.846 --> 21:06.598
(exhales)

21:06.682 --> 21:09.226
-You're fired!
-D'oh!

21:09.309 --> 21:13.355
It's so nice having
everything back to normal.

21:13.438 --> 21:17.442
I'm a vampire, and I've come
to suck your blood.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.444
Blah! Oh--

21:19.528 --> 21:21.571
This cape is giving me a rash.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.533
-Grampa's a vampire?
-We're all vampires.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.952
But, no, we killed Mr. Burns.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.621
You have to kill
the head vampire.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.915
You're the head vampire?

21:31.999 --> 21:34.710
No, I'm the head vampire!

21:34.793 --> 21:38.005
(laughs)

21:38.088 --> 21:39.756
-Mom?
-Well, I do have a life

21:39.840 --> 21:41.383
outside this house, you know.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.844
