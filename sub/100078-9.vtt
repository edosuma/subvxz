NATALIE:
I don't remember a lot.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.177
There's something
I wanna ask you.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.680
You've helped me
through a very difficult time.

00:13.764 --> 00:14.515
Do you love him?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.893
He slipped the ring on your finger
when you were unconscious.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.396
It doesn't matter,
because it's over.

00:20.479 --> 00:23.232
And, you!
Get out of my life.

00:23.566 --> 00:26.360
- Dr. Manning?
- Agent Lee told me what was going on.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.487
Agent Lee told me
what was going on.

00:36.871 --> 00:37.913
(EXHALES)

00:49.800 --> 00:51.594
DR. PATCHEFSKY: Hi, April.

00:51.677 --> 00:54.013
I've got your test results.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.890
You couldn't tell me
over the phone?

00:55.973 --> 00:58.184
Well, I just thought
we should discuss this in person.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.269
Okay.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.562
Good news.

01:01.645 --> 01:05.357
Your thyroid and pituitary tests
were completely normal.

01:05.441 --> 01:09.278
And your HSG X–ray shows that
your fallopian tubes are open.

01:09.361 --> 01:13.949
Okay. So, what's
the bad news?

01:14.033 --> 01:17.161
Your AMH and antral follicle
count are low.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.914
And your FSH is high.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.666
Even though you're only in your 30s,
that indicates that there's...

01:22.750 --> 01:24.001
Early onset menopause?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.253
I like to call it
exactly what it is.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.506
Low ovarian reserve.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.841
I'm the reason we
haven't gotten pregnant.

01:30.925 --> 01:33.427
Spontaneous pregnancy
isn't impossible.

01:33.511 --> 01:37.807
Dr. Patchefsky, the miscarriage
a few years ago and now this?

01:37.890 --> 01:40.726
Ethan wants a baby.
I can't...

01:42.186 --> 01:44.021
I can't give him one.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.774
April, this is far
from hopeless.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.567
Ethan should get tested, too.

01:48.651 --> 01:51.195
And then the two of you
might want to discuss IVF.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.239
- IVF?
- Mmm–hmm.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.990
I'd recommend
starting sooner than later.

01:55.074 --> 01:58.744
With low ovarian reserve,
you may not be responsive.

02:01.121 --> 02:06.293
So, I go home and I tell Ethan
I am going through menopause,

02:06.377 --> 02:09.630
and even with IVF, I still might not
be able to get pregnant.

You were gone a long time.

02:27.273 --> 02:30.484
Oh... Yeah,
it was crowded.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.322
Do you really have to leave?

02:35.406 --> 02:37.116
Yeah.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.001
I told you, doc
on a carrier had an MI,

02:47.084 --> 02:49.044
sounds pretty serious,
they called up a reservist.

You're not dressed.

03:44.266 --> 03:48.103

I'd stay home today.

and talk me out of it.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.609

but I'm not a match.

Well, the good news is that there was
no sign of infection.

you can have the surgery.

So, if somebody from your guy's family
matches our guy and is willing to donate,

will donate his kidney to your guy.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.024
With your blood pressure...

12:13.108 --> 12:14.609
And that means that my son
will get a kidney?

12:14.693 --> 12:16.862
Yes. From my
patient's brother.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.656
- Wait.
- Dan, I am your mother.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.408
It's a kidney. It's nothing.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.369
- What if something happens?
- Honey, you're my baby.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.538
I can't imagine
life without you.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.460
When you have children of your own,
you'll understand.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.759
I'll give the transplant team a call,
get things started.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.056
- Hey, did you hear the good news?
- Yeah.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.433
- All right. Can we talk?
- I'm busy.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.643
But it'll just take a second.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.270
About your reaction
to the book earlier,

12:50.353 --> 12:52.105
I know you're anxious
about not getting pregnant.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.857
- (SIGHS) Let's just forget it.
- No, here's the plan.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.276
I have some time this afternoon.
I'll go see a urologist.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.153
- What? Why?
- Get a semen analysis.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.321
Make sure I'm not shooting blanks.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.990
Oh, my God. Ethan, why do we have to talk
about this all the time?

13:02.073 --> 13:03.450
Look, I just wanna make sure
I'm not the problem.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.160
There is no problem!

13:05.243 --> 13:06.995
Look, I'm not saying there is,
but just in case.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.164
- Oh, my... I'm so sick of this!
- Sick of what?

13:09.247 --> 13:10.540
The pressure!

13:11.625 --> 13:14.336
I don't even know
if I want a baby anymore.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.755
What are you saying?

13:18.632 --> 13:19.841
April!

13:32.354 --> 13:34.231
Hey, there, Jordy,
good news.

13:40.779 --> 13:41.780
Wow.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.074
Well, maybe you can go skate. Tell me,
how are you feeling?

Real good.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.286

What does that mean?

13:55.335 --> 13:56.920
I'm not sure.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.715
You feel that?

14:00.799 --> 14:02.342
Uh–uh.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.386
Squeeze my hand.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.181
Not so strong now, huh?

14:08.265 --> 14:09.599
No.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.185
Okay, Jordy, I wanna run one more test
before you go.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.021
It's another type of scan
called an MRI. Dad?

14:16.606 --> 14:17.691
Okay.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.402
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll be okay.

I'll, uh...
I'm gonna put that order in.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.576
Okay.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.121
Jeremy and I have decided
we're going to try to adopt Sophie.

I'm really happy
to hear that.

is looking good at 85%.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.339
Uh, this is Dr. Frisch.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.883
- She will be doing Sophie's procedure.
- Hello.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.678
Did you know that the patient's father
has instructed

14:46.761 --> 14:47.929
that if Sophie arrests,

14:48.013 --> 14:49.180
we are not to resuscitate?

14:49.264 --> 14:51.266
- What?
- A DNR?

14:51.349 --> 14:54.144
You mean, you're just
supposed to let her die?

14:54.227 --> 14:55.937
What, no, I...
I can't believe this.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.772
- Are you sure?
- It's right here in the chart.

14:57.856 --> 14:58.940
Why would he do that?

14:59.024 --> 15:01.359
He wouldn't.
I mean, he couldn't...

15:01.443 --> 15:03.278
JEREMY: Yes, he could.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.488
Sophie's not perfect.
That makes her too much work.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.240
But he's been
so devoted to her.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.659
I've seen him take such wonderful
care of her.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.329
Because he was getting something
out of it. You.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.124
Now that you're not in the picture,
he doesn't need Sophie anymore.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.667
What?

15:17.751 --> 15:19.127
Look, can you get him
to change his mind?

15:19.210 --> 15:22.839
I tried to call him. He's not picking up.
I don't even know where he is.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.051
Well, I'm not comfortable performing
this surgery on a child with a DNR.

into her procedure.

I can't believe
this is actually happening.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.452
When do I go up?

15:52.535 --> 15:54.788

I've got to family, Maggie.

any arrangements?

about getting better.

So, that's it?
There's no way to overturn this DNR?

- The father abandoned the baby.
- We don't know that.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.289
And Mr. Davis left
very clear instructions.

has suffered enough

18:05.335 --> 18:07.921
"and if the good Lord decided to take her,
we should let him."

That's ridiculous!
He's not even religious.

18:10.673 --> 18:14.344
Dr. Manning, both the Ethics Committee
and Legal said this DNR is valid.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.022
No. And I
understand her refusal.

and the baby is likely to arrest.

Jordy, Russell, this is Dr. Abrams,
our chief of neurosurgery.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.621
Hi.

22:10.705 --> 22:16.252
Jordy, your MRI revealed a condition
called atlantoaxial instability.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.129
- Big words.
WILL: Yeah.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.798
What it means is that your spine
is built a little differently

22:20.882 --> 22:23.176
and working not
quite the way it should.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.887
Yeah. We see it in
about 25% of DS patients.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.096
I know.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.682
Um, is there a way
to treat it?

22:30.725 --> 22:31.809
Why don't we talk outside?

22:33.186 --> 22:35.605
Hey, Jordy, buddy,
I'll be right back. Okay?

22:35.688 --> 22:36.814
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.695
So, there're two options.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.614
First, I can surgically
repair the instability.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.908
But it's an invasive,
high–risk surgery.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.243
It could fix the problem
or it could make things worse,

22:49.327 --> 22:51.454
severely limit
Jordy's range of motion.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.665
And the second option?

22:54.749 --> 22:56.876
Stabilize the spine
with a halo vest.

22:56.959 --> 23:00.171
It's a type of brace, and wait
for the whiplash to heal.

23:00.254 --> 23:03.508
It's a much safer route,
and that's what I'd recommend.

23:03.591 --> 23:04.634
Dr. Abrams?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.761
Atlantoaxial instability
is congenital.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.305
So, eventually Jordy's gonna
need the surgery.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.350
Right. But it is possible
to put it off for years.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.394

23:17.730 --> 23:18.898

I don't wanna take the risk.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.657
- All right.
- Thanks, Sam.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.660
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell Jordy.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.789
Special Olympics won't let him compete
with this condition.

23:34.872 --> 23:36.165
He'd have to
have it repaired.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.210
This is gonna
break his heart.

23:43.381 --> 23:47.718
I feel bad for that family, but
how much time does Mike have?

23:47.802 --> 23:49.887
He's gonna die
without that kidney.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.182
(PAGER BUZZES)
- This could be it.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.436
Let's hope for good news.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.484
So, legal has made
a determination.

24:03.568 --> 24:07.071
Since Mrs. Schiller's kidney
had been removed from her body,

24:07.155 --> 24:09.532
the hospital is
considered its caretaker.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.868
The Ethics Committee believes that

24:11.951 --> 24:14.370
the kidney should go
to Dr. Marcel's patient,

24:14.453 --> 24:17.957
as originally designated
by the donor.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.126
Mr. Schiller's wishes
will not be honored.

24:24.338 --> 24:25.548
Gonna go scrub.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.510
You know it was the right thing.
We're saving a life.

24:29.594 --> 24:31.387
It's a little more
nuanced than that.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.513
Ethan, don't walk away.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.473
April, there's a man
who has to tell his wife,

24:34.557 --> 24:37.643
when she wakes up from surgery, that
her kidney is gone and her son is dead.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.228
- You wanna be there for that?
- I know.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.106
It's a terrible situation.
You think I don't know that?

24:42.190 --> 24:44.567
This is the best outcome
we could have.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.111
What, you just want me to feel bad,
is that it?

24:47.195 --> 24:49.739
What about you?
You been at me all day.

24:51.699 --> 24:53.492
Look, I don't know
what's going on between us,

24:53.576 --> 24:55.328
but maybe it's a good thing
I'm going away.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.295
Daniel?

25:05.880 --> 25:09.091
- I thought you were taking the day off.
- I am.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.344
And I'm gonna need
a few more.

25:11.427 --> 25:14.305
I'm gonna take CeCe away
for a couple days.

25:14.388 --> 25:15.973
To Mackinac Island.

25:16.057 --> 25:19.810
Ah, well, that was always
a special place for the two of you.

25:19.894 --> 25:23.814
Yeah. Anyway,
we're gonna have a party tonight.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.942
Just for a few
close friends, like you.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.568
(CHUCKLES)
- Um...

25:27.652 --> 25:32.073
Kind of a, um...
Like a bon voyage party.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.291
Okay.

25:42.375 --> 25:46.629
Hey, none of that.
None of that, okay?

25:46.712 --> 25:48.839
Well, it's just...
It's just a little party.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.176
Okay.

25:59.308 --> 26:02.144
No, no! Fix me!
They have to fix me!

26:02.228 --> 26:05.189
They have to fix me! Fix me.
They have to fix me!

26:05.273 --> 26:07.400
- Just keep it down, okay?
- No.

26:08.859 --> 26:09.860
Can I help?

26:09.944 --> 26:11.195
I told him what
we were gonna do.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.531
I don't want that!
I want them to fix me!

26:13.614 --> 26:14.740
He wants the operation.

26:14.824 --> 26:17.451
I want to skate!
Show him. Show him me.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.996
- Jordy...
- Show him me!

26:20.079 --> 26:23.958
- Show me...
- A video of Jordy skating.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.127
I can fly. You'll see.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.670
Look, I'll forward it to you.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.005
JORDY: I can fly.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.757
Jordy, okay, there are other
things that you can do.

26:31.841 --> 26:33.509
Okay, we'll find something else
that you'll love just as much.

26:33.592 --> 26:37.054
No. I want to fly.
I want to be free.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.978
Ben, I'm concerned
about your chest X–ray.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.981
The patchy white–out indicates
diffuse airspace disease.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.817
He's on a high–flow cannula.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.193
It's not cutting it.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.988
He's oxygenating poorly
and his pCO2 is rising.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.531
He's in acute
respiratory failure.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.991
Ben, I'm gonna
have to intubate you.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.744
- Twenty etomidate, hundred of sux.
- Right.

27:00.745 --> 27:01.787
Okay.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.039
Okay, Ben.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.043
Okay.

27:10.713 --> 27:11.922
Meds are in.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.223
I'm in.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.100
Bag him,
and I'll call for a vent.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.611
I don't think
he has long.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.155
Okay.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.323
I'm sorry.

27:49.752 --> 27:50.836
DR. LATHAM: Heart's beating.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.422
Take her off bypass.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.550
And she's off.

27:56.634 --> 27:59.053
Pulmonary artery pressure
is still high.

27:59.136 --> 28:00.596
Unless we're able to lower it,
she won't survive.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.806
Put her back on bypass.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.725
Eleven blade scalpel
and aortic punch.

28:14.610 --> 28:17.279
Placing a five–millimeter
fenestration

28:17.363 --> 28:20.449
so the extra pressure
decompresses into her left atrium.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.119
- Pressure's still not lowering.
- Put her on V–A ECMO?

28:23.202 --> 28:25.746
Not an option,
violates the DNR.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.206
(MACHINE BEEPING)

28:27.289 --> 28:30.000
Okay. She's in
pulmonary edema and failing.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.711
Must be a structural issue
we haven't found yet.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.716
Ah, stenosis.

28:39.468 --> 28:40.886
Prepare for angioplasty.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.979
Look at me, I'm flying!

28:50.062 --> 28:51.772
RUSSELL: Fastest skate runner.

28:51.856 --> 28:54.817
Wait, one, two... Okay, now make a face.
Okay. One more.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.360
JORDY: No!

28:56.444 --> 28:58.362
No!

28:58.446 --> 29:01.490
I can't stand it.
What do I do?

29:04.869 --> 29:06.454
Hey, guys.

29:06.537 --> 29:07.913
Give us a couple minutes.

29:13.002 --> 29:14.295
This is my fault.

29:14.378 --> 29:17.089
I was always compensating
for having a kid with Down's.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.385
I just wanted to have a regular boy,
so I pushed him into sports.

29:23.846 --> 29:24.930
Maybe you did.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.391
But he loves that sport.

29:28.726 --> 29:31.312
Jordy's the most important
thing in my life,

29:31.395 --> 29:33.772
he's the best thing
in my life.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.734
I can't do anything
that would cause him harm.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.986
I get it.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.447
Now, I'm the one
who told you this was the safer option.

29:41.530 --> 29:44.658
And I certainly
understand your fears,

29:44.742 --> 29:46.285
but maybe this
isn't about you.

29:47.828 --> 29:50.206
Maybe it's about Jordy,
and what he wants.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.290
JORDY: Dad?

29:52.958 --> 29:54.210
Dad?

29:54.293 --> 29:55.794
I watched that video.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.174
He said, "I can fly."

30:00.257 --> 30:01.592
(CHUCKLES)
- I saw that.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.970
And he said,
"I want to be free."

30:07.389 --> 30:08.557
I saw that, too.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.268
JORDY: Dad?

30:14.605 --> 30:15.689
Daddy?

30:16.273 --> 30:17.525
Hey, buddy.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.284
CARL: Twelve minutes.
Gotta finish up and take her off bypass.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.078
DR. LATHAM: Final knot
on the patch is tied.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.287
Cut the stitch.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.376
Take her off bypass.

30:40.673 --> 30:42.174
How's her pressure, Carl?

30:42.258 --> 30:43.551
CARL: PA pressure...

30:45.010 --> 30:47.429
Down to 50, was 80.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.514
- Good sign.
- Mmm.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.891
DR. LATHAM: And good
ventricular function.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.562
I believe this little girl's
health issues have been resolved.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.022
Let's close.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.907
I'm not gonna be coming home tonight.
I'll leave for my deployment from here.

31:06.991 --> 31:08.075
Why?

31:11.912 --> 31:14.331
I'm gonna stay with Bill Schiller
till his wife wakes up.

31:14.415 --> 31:15.624
I wanna be there for him.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.630
Did you mean what you said?

31:23.132 --> 31:25.050
About not wanting
to have a baby?

31:27.928 --> 31:29.638
I don't know what I want.

31:33.976 --> 31:36.186
Well, you got six weeks
to figure it out.

31:40.691 --> 31:43.068
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

31:43.152 --> 31:44.445
Dr. Lanik wants you.

31:45.321 --> 31:46.989
(SIGHS)

31:47.072 --> 31:48.073
Okay.

31:55.998 --> 31:58.751
His O2 sats are 94%.

31:58.834 --> 31:59.877
They're improving.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.546
Look at his latest chest X–ray.
Lungs look a lot better.

32:02.630 --> 32:05.758
I don't understand.
He's improving?

32:05.841 --> 32:07.760
Seems that way.
Labs are better, too.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.095
White count up to four,
platelets up to 75.

32:10.179 --> 32:12.348
Below normal, but
a lot better than before.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.974
How?

32:14.058 --> 32:16.685
Well, the only thing I can think,
they stopped his chemo,

32:16.769 --> 32:19.647
that allowed his immune system
to bounce back, fight the infection.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.108
Keep your fingers crossed.

32:33.827 --> 32:36.080
So, are you gonna go fix me?

32:36.163 --> 32:37.247
Yes, I am.

32:37.331 --> 32:38.624
Yeah. You're gonna
go to sleep,

32:38.707 --> 32:40.626
and when you wake up,
everything's gonna be okay.

32:40.709 --> 32:41.710
Okay.

33:03.524 --> 33:04.858
(GASPS SOFTLY)

33:10.239 --> 33:11.407
It was just like this.

33:13.367 --> 33:16.161
Sophie was recovering
from her surgery.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.290
And Agent Lee...

33:20.374 --> 33:21.834
Will loves you.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.380
You would be a fool
not to take him back.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.092
Oh, my God.

33:33.095 --> 33:36.432
I have been
so unfair to Will.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.975
(INAUDIBLE)

33:39.852 --> 33:42.354
All this time,
I have been so unfair to Will.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.208
Jordy should be
back on the ice very soon.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.085
(SIGHS) Thank God.

34:06.837 --> 34:09.339
Let me know when he's competing.
I'd like to come.

34:09.423 --> 34:10.758
I will.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.469
Thank you!

34:16.472 --> 34:18.932
Looks like Jordy
gets to keep flying.

you wanna do this?

when he was a little boy.

35:27.334 --> 35:30.128
- He's loved it ever since.
(CHUCKLES)

room rate,

35:32.130 --> 35:33.924
because we're
going off–season.

35:34.007 --> 35:36.009
- Gave the honeymoon suite.
- Oh, nice.

35:36.093 --> 35:38.679
Oh.
Got the honeymoon suite.

- Ooh.

go with you and Mom.

Oh, sweetie.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.062
Of course you do.

(COUGHS)

38:19.631 --> 38:22.009
Okay, okay. Okay.

38:26.722 --> 38:28.306
Maggie...

38:29.891 --> 38:31.727
Ben.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.062
I'm alive.

38:36.106 --> 38:39.526
Yes, sweetheart, you are.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.758
Look at me, I'm flying!

39:02.841 --> 39:03.842
(CHUCKLES)

39:05.969 --> 39:07.054
Will.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.309
I remember that night.

39:14.061 --> 39:16.146
I was coming
to tell you that

39:16.229 --> 39:18.440
I'm sorry for
the way I treated you.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.649
That I was wrong.

39:23.111 --> 39:26.156
- It doesn't matter anymore.
- No, it does. Because...

39:26.239 --> 39:27.324
That's not all.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.909
No. You don't need
to do this.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.286
I do, I do.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.412
Because

39:33.455 --> 39:34.998
I came to tell you that

39:35.957 --> 39:37.292
I love you.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.503
And I wanna be with you.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.379
Natalie, stop.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.759
You told me
to get out of your life.

39:45.842 --> 39:49.054
I know, and I am so sorry.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.807
You don't understand. I did.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.601
And it's been good for me.
It really has.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.479
Will,

39:57.562 --> 39:59.773
- we can... We can figure...
- No. We...

39:59.856 --> 40:01.817
Aren't good
for one another.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.112
All we do
is hurt each other.

40:07.781 --> 40:11.952
There was a time
I couldn't imagine a future without you,

40:12.035 --> 40:13.578
but I can now.

40:13.662 --> 40:16.331
I feel...

40:16.414 --> 40:17.499
Free.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.126
Will?

40:19.209 --> 40:21.211
I'm sorry, Natalie.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.685
