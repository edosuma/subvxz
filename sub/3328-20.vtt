00:01.300 --> 00:03.518
Previously on Elementary...
_A|istair?
MISS Watson.

00:03.570 --> 00:06.391
In London, I had a small
part in a radio drama.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.533
Sherlock wrote me a letter
when he was ten

00:08.570 --> 00:10.458
saying that I, alone,
of all the cast,

00:10.510 --> 00:12.398
truly captured
the Yorkshire accent.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.702
(laughs)
So, eventually,

00:13.740 --> 00:16.277
we met, so I could coach him
on his nuances.

00:16.310 --> 00:17.607
We became friends.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.311
You knew him when he was using.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.183
Nine months ago, he shows up
at my flat, at night,

00:22.220 --> 00:23.710
so high,
he could barely speak.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.411
It was very...

00:25.450 --> 00:28.453
difficult for me.

00:30.790 --> 00:34.590
(with Irish brogue):
The time I've lost in wooing,
in watching and pursuing,

00:34.630 --> 00:36.621
the light that lies
in woman's eyes

00:38.730 --> 00:42.166
And a good morning to you, too.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.098
ALISTAIR (in accent, recorded):
The time I've lost in wooing,

00:44.140 --> 00:45.437
in watching and pursuing,

00:45.470 --> 00:48.337
the light that lies
in woman's eyes,

00:48.380 --> 00:51.702
has been my heart's undoing.
That's Alistair, right?

00:51.750 --> 00:53.513
(with accent): Aye. We're having
breakfast today.
Oh.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.518
I didn't realize he was still
helping you With your accents.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.643
I would have thought you had an
Irish one in your repertoire.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.180
(regular voice):
The Irish accent is reserved

00:59.220 --> 01:00.756
for those people
living in Ireland.

01:00.790 --> 01:02.826
This is the distinct cadence
and tonality

01:02.860 --> 01:05.078
of the Derry region
in Northern Ireland.

01:05.130 --> 01:06.427
Alistair pointed out

01:06.460 --> 01:08.553
that my intonations
would never pass muster

01:08.600 --> 01:10.090
with a Derry native,
so he was kind enough

01:10.130 --> 01:11.427
to record some poems

01:11.470 --> 01:13.097
and colloquialisms

01:13.140 --> 01:15.438
for me to review
before our next breakfast.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.563
ALISTAIR (with accent):
He's fit to mind mice
at a crossroads.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.272
(with accent):
He fit to mind mice
at a crossroads.

01:20.310 --> 01:22.449
Well, I have to go
down to the station

01:22.480 --> 01:24.471
and give some files
back to Marcus.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.410
Keep up with the accent.

01:26.450 --> 01:28.611
You never know when you're gonna
have to go undercover in Derry.

01:33.190 --> 01:34.782
Hey, have you
seen Marcus around?

01:34.820 --> 01:38.529
No, he's probably,
uh, grabbing coffee.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.653
Hey, Ijust got a call
from holding that we got

01:40.700 --> 01:42.565
a guy that's sick or something.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.659
I know you're not a doctor
anymore, but, uh...

01:44.700 --> 01:47.396
I can take a look.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.508
We've already called
for a bus.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.508
He was moaning
and then nothing.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.872
Can I get a pair
of gloves?

01:58.210 --> 02:00.349
What's his name?

02:00.380 --> 02:03.213
Apollo Mercer.
He's a known pickpocket.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.514
I caught him working
Union Square this morning.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.814
Apollo, my name is Joan.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.828
Are you okay?

02:17.570 --> 02:19.231
No pulse.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.635
He's dead.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.809
Oh, he was fine
a few hours ago.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.899
GREGSON:
Get me the desk officer.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.703
I want to know what went
on In here this morning.

02:27.980 --> 02:30.175
I need you
to take a step back.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.371
You should quarantine
the prisoners and anyone else

02:32.420 --> 02:34.843
who's been in contact with him
to a different location.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.314
What's going on?
I won't know for sure until
the ME. runs a few tests,

02:37.350 --> 02:38.908
but that fluid draining from
his mouth is a mixture of

02:38.950 --> 02:40.554
necrotic tissue and blood.

02:40.590 --> 02:43.718
First blush,
I'd say he died from anthrax.

03:27.470 --> 03:29.563
So, is this the file of the man
who succumbed to the anthrax?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.602
None of us were exposed,
in case you were wondering.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.278
My lack of wonder comes not
from an absence of concern,

03:34.310 --> 03:35.607
but from the obviousness
of the answer.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.902
And the rest of your men?

03:36.950 --> 03:38.577
So far, everyone's clean.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.817
Even though it isn't contagious,
we had to

03:40.850 --> 03:42.579
evacuate the precinct
until we know

03:42.620 --> 03:45.418
for sure that the victim
was exposed elsewhere.

03:45.450 --> 03:47.554
Victim being
Apollo Mercer.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.888
Several priors for grand
larceny, possession of cocaine.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.558
Chased down for pickpocketing
in Union Square.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.727
The M.E. just sent some
preliminary findings.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.297
A small, torn plastic bag
was found

03:57.330 --> 03:58.797
in the victim's
digestive tract.

03:58.830 --> 04:01.663
Lab work on the bag found traces
of powderized anthrax.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.602
Well, I guess we know
how he got exposed.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.403
And why he died
so quickly.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.601
Once that bag ruptured, the
anthrax would have gone directly

04:09.650 --> 04:11.572
into the mucosal tissues
of his GI system.

04:11.610 --> 04:13.669
Well, the question is,
where did he get it?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.472
I didn't see anything
about any terrorist ties

04:15.520 --> 04:17.442
in his criminal history.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.583
It's more likely he acquired
the bag from one of his marks,

04:19.620 --> 04:20.882
assumed the powder was cocaine.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.751
And once the police
gave chase, he swallowed it.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.678
Or he didn't want the cops
to catch him with anthrax.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.288
Seems unlikely he would have
knowingly swallowed

04:26.330 --> 04:27.729
a biological terror agent.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.296
Especially since
his priors suggest

04:29.330 --> 04:31.366
he had a drug problem,
not an anthrax problem.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.038
If you're right, we need to find
out who he stole it from.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.038
Pull this morning's security
footage from Union Square.

04:35.070 --> 04:36.606
All of it.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.460
I'll make sure_
you two get copies.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.774
WATSON: All right, anthrax is
in New York again.

04:40.810 --> 04:42.869
The first time
it happened, in 2001,

04:42.910 --> 04:44.377
I was a doctor.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.048
All of my patients
were panicking.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.513
Anyone with a cough
thought they had it.

04:47.550 --> 04:48.778
People were
hoarding Cipro,

04:48.820 --> 04:50.344
just in case.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.914
"Save the Sumatran Orangutan."

04:51.950 --> 04:53.053
Hmm?

04:53.090 --> 04:54.978
Mr. Mercer's fictional charity.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.920
He told his marks _
he was collecting donations,

04:56.960 --> 04:58.985
all the while,
using his clipboard

04:59.030 --> 05:01.419
to conceal the hand
he was using to rob them.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.392
Huh. Apollo bumps
into someone here.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.294
Maybe that's when
he stole the anthrax.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.479
HOLMES:
Since that move,

05:14.510 --> 05:15.932
known as "glad-handing,"
is used solely

05:15.980 --> 05:17.447
for removing a watch
from a wrist,

05:17.480 --> 05:19.846
no, that is not
when he stole the anthrax.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.418
Did something
happen this morning?

05:25.450 --> 05:27.554
_ A_man rotted from _
the in5ide out. Pay attention.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.820
I mean with Alistair.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.680
These screens are too small
for my purposes.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.095
I'm adjourning
to the media room.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.859
This is what I'm
talking about.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.868
You've been in a mood since
you got back from breakfast.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.424
Actually, I had
to forego our breakfast.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.097
On account of...?
Alistair being dead.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.789
What?

05:45.540 --> 05:48.998
I arrived first,
which was unusual.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.975
After 20 minutes, I began
to think I got the date wrong,

05:52.010 --> 05:53.739
so I called his cell phone.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.714
His partner, Ian, answered,

05:55.750 --> 05:59.652
and, uh, told me that Alistair
passed away a week ago.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.579
Sherlock, I'm so sorry.
What happened?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.689
Heart attack. Quite a
massive one, apparently.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.698
So he went
pretty quickly.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.022
Unfortunately, I missed
the, uh, funeral.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.062
I told Ian I'd go 'round
tomorrow, pay my respects.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.863
Are you okay?
You want to talk?

06:14.900 --> 06:16.765
No.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.479
Look here. (laughs)

06:20.510 --> 06:22.808
Yes, our Mr. Mercer is a flimper
of quite extraordinary talent.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.442
He just lifted

06:24.480 --> 06:26.539
something out
of this man's breast pocket.

06:26.580 --> 06:27.877
A wallet?

06:27.920 --> 06:29.615
Mm, the police have
already accounted

06:29.650 --> 06:31.686
for all the wallets
Mr. Mercer stole this morning.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.119
And none of them
was from anyone

06:33.160 --> 06:35.412
fitting that description.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.781
WATSON:
According to this,

06:37.830 --> 06:39.081
Mercer dumped a watch,

06:39.130 --> 06:42.099
bracelet, a smart phone and...

06:42.130 --> 06:43.825
a hard sunglasses case.

06:43.870 --> 06:47.988
That is something that you could
keep in your breast pocket.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.668
No sunglasses were recovered,
just the case.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.473
Perhaps it was
being used to protect

06:52.510 --> 06:55.172
a dangerous biological
weapon during transport.
Hmm.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.701
I would say that we've
just had our first look

06:57.750 --> 06:59.877
at our anthrax courier,
but we still face

06:59.920 --> 07:01.876
the considerable task
of identifying him.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.480
Actually, it may not be
that considerable after all.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.818
I recognize that man from some
of the footage I was reviewing.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.919
I think I saw...

07:08.960 --> 07:11.178
Yes, he bought a cup of coffee,
right there.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.892
Paid for it with an app
on his phone.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.524
We may not know his identity,
but that coffee truck will.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.197
BELL:
The name is Charlie Simon.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.232
Lives right up here.

07:20.270 --> 07:22.659
Did two years at Allenwood
for stealing equipment

07:22.710 --> 07:24.234
from a lab
at Columbia Medical School.

07:24.270 --> 07:25.760
He'd been working there
as a tech.

07:25.810 --> 07:27.072
That's interesting.

07:27.110 --> 07:28.702
Most major
universities
keep samples

07:28.740 --> 07:30.549
of anthrax for
research purposes.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.070
You think the stuff

07:32.110 --> 07:34.214
that pickpocket swallowed came
from Columbia?

07:34.250 --> 07:36.218
You could never steal
that amount of anthrax

07:36.250 --> 07:38.787
without someone noticing
it was gone from a secure lab.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.209
But given Mr. Simon's
background, all he would need

07:41.260 --> 07:43.683
is a spore and a lab
to start growing his own.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.051
I'm guessing
it's the kind of lab

07:46.090 --> 07:48.820
he could set up in his house?

07:48.860 --> 07:51.693
Like I said,
Charlie's not here.

07:51.730 --> 07:53.789
I don't think
he came home last night.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.707
How do you and Mr. Simon
know each other?
We don't.

07:56.740 --> 07:59.061
I mean, not really.
We're just roommates.

07:59.110 --> 08:00.839
My parents
bought this place,

08:00.880 --> 08:03.576
but I got to cover
the mortgage, so I put

08:03.610 --> 08:05.009
an ad online about the room.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.972
He was the first person
who answered.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.248
Did you know he was an ex-con

08:08.280 --> 08:10.043
when you asked him
to live with you?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.183
People make mistakes, right?
They deserve second chances.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.654
Just 'cause a guy did
a little time doesn't mean

08:14.690 --> 08:15.987
he can't be a good roommate.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.056
His walks

08:18.090 --> 08:20.524
are a little weird, but
nothing I can't live with.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.697
His walks?

08:21.730 --> 08:23.960
He takes three
or four every night.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.627
Half an hour each time,
like clockwork.

08:25.670 --> 08:28.935
Always comes back smelling
like antiseptic or something.

08:28.970 --> 08:30.608
Like that stuff
you put on your hands.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.938
And you're sure
he was walking, not driving?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.130
Positive.
He doesn't have a car.

08:35.180 --> 08:38.069
You gonna tell me
what this is all about or what?

08:38.110 --> 08:41.045
If Charlie Simon has a lab,
it's not in there.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.843
Lab?

08:42.890 --> 08:45.142
We have reason to believe
your roommate was involved

08:45.190 --> 08:46.680
in an anthrax death
that occurred

08:46.720 --> 08:48.585
at our precinct
earlier today.

08:48.620 --> 08:49.757
Did Charlie ever express

08:49.790 --> 08:51.121
any extreme political views,

08:51.160 --> 08:52.320
any terrorist leanings?

08:52.360 --> 08:54.123
No, never.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.321
He-he bitched
about his ex-wife a lot,

08:56.360 --> 08:58.260
all the alimony
he was paying, but...

08:59.740 --> 09:01.093
Could you excuse me?

09:01.140 --> 09:04.303
I got to call
my mom and dad.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.898
(Watson sighs)

09:05.940 --> 09:07.305
Charlie's lab must be

09:07.340 --> 09:09.137
within walking distance
of this place.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.909
Anthrax requires
frequent monitoring

09:10.950 --> 09:12.747
during the growth cycle.

09:12.780 --> 09:15.271
So you think his walks were
less about stretching his legs

09:15.320 --> 09:17.288
and more_about
tending to his spores.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.015
Well, if he smelled
like antiseptic,

09:19.050 --> 09:21.655
he was probably disinfecting
himself before he left the lab.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.920
So, once he was there,
how long do you estimate

09:23.960 --> 09:26.178
it would take him to
assess the spores' progress?

09:26.230 --> 09:28.027
I'd say no more
than ten minutes.

09:28.060 --> 09:30.164
Making his travel time in each
direction also ten minutes.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.737
How tail is Mr. Simon?
Five-eleven.

09:32.770 --> 09:34.328
Right. So, the
average stride length

09:34.370 --> 09:36.736
for a man of that height
is 1.8 meters.

09:36.770 --> 09:38.328
An average of 107
steps a minute

09:38.370 --> 09:41.635
gives us a search radius
ofjust over half a mile.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.773
Now, given Mr. Simon's
financial woes,

09:43.810 --> 09:45.641
an entire additional
domICIle seems unlikely,

09:45.680 --> 09:47.819
so we're looking
for a non-residential place

09:47.850 --> 09:49.909
which would offer
privacy and security.

09:49.950 --> 09:52.089
All right, we'll pull a list
together, get a canvas started.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.678
WATSON:
Before we do that,
you might want

09:53.720 --> 09:55.051
to check out
Charlie Simon's

09:55.090 --> 09:56.682
storage unit he was renting.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.357
It's right down the street.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.089
Team One...
I think we found the lab.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.637
Oddly, I find myself hoping

10:12.680 --> 10:14.898
that Charlie Simon was just
planning to kill his ex-wife.

10:14.940 --> 10:18.808
If he was, then the bag
which killed Apollo Mercer

10:18.850 --> 10:21.739
may represent the grand
total of his efforts.

10:27.090 --> 10:29.615
Team One, we've got a body.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.252
GREGSON:
So much for asking Charlie Simon
how much anthrax he made.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.899
So far, no powder.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.014
Captain, might we get another
look at those trays, please?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.327
CAPTAIN (over radio):
They're all stained red.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.796
That's because until
recently they contained
sheep's blood agar.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.434
It is considered the
best growth medium

11:15.470 --> 11:17.108
for anthrax spores.

11:17.140 --> 11:19.108
But there must
be over

11:19.140 --> 11:21.108
a hundred empty trays.
Mm-hmm.

11:21.140 --> 11:24.348
This lab produced enough anthrax
to fill thousands of bags

11:24.380 --> 11:26.348
like the one which
killed Apollo Mercer.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.013
And it's all gone.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.457
As you all know,
our stationhouse

11:39.490 --> 11:41.492
has been declared anthrax-free.

11:41.530 --> 11:44.465
Unfortunately, the same
cannot be said for our city.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.391
That's because we believe
that Charlie Simon

11:48.440 --> 11:52.331
produced over 40 pounds
of weaponized anthrax.

11:52.370 --> 11:55.476
That's enough to infect
half a million people.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.375
And it's all missing.

11:57.410 --> 11:59.275
Now, CSU found two sets
of fingerprints

11:59.310 --> 12:01.119
in the storage locker.

12:01.150 --> 12:02.469
One was Simon's,

12:02.520 --> 12:04.511
and the other one
belonged to this man,

12:04.550 --> 12:06.108
Eugene MacIntosh.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.788
BELL:
Eugene did three years

12:07.820 --> 12:09.856
in Allenwood after
he assaulted a census worker.

12:09.890 --> 12:12.484
Apparently, he and Charlie
were close in prison.

12:12.530 --> 12:15.090
Unlike Charlie, Eugene has
definite radical leanings.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.098
_ He's associated _
With a gang of extremists

12:17.130 --> 12:18.768
called the Sovereign Army.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.939
These guys hate the government,
including the NYPD.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.369
But they're big fans

12:22.400 --> 12:24.265
of violence
and the Second Amendment.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.369
So we should all
tread carefully.

12:26.410 --> 12:28.332
Finding Eugene MacIntosh
is our best shot

12:28.380 --> 12:31.076
at tracking the anthrax--
but like Detective Bell said,

12:31.110 --> 12:34.147
he should be considered
armed and dangerous.

12:34.180 --> 12:38.082
We believe he is responsible for
the killing of Charlie Simon.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.951
All right.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.886
Do you mind telling me where
Holmes wandered off to?

12:44.930 --> 12:48.024
He had some personal business
he had to attend to.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.254
More important
than a would-be terrorist

12:49.300 --> 12:50.858
with 40 pounds of anthrax?

12:50.900 --> 12:52.026
It's personal.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.890
Said he was gonna join us later.
Okay.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.430
MacIntosh has a brother
named Bart

12:55.470 --> 12:57.301
who owns a dairy farm upstate.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.535
Bell's gonna take a ride
and go see him.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.128
I'd like you to join him.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.135
Sure.

13:02.180 --> 13:03.147
(knocking on door)

13:07.350 --> 13:08.908
Sherlock.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.986
Ian.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.319
My condolences for your loss.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.453
Please, come in.

13:22.900 --> 13:26.063
I'm sorry I didn't get in touch
when Alistair passed.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.936
I know you were friends
for a very long time.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.437
Yes.

13:32.470 --> 13:36.031
A privilege which
afforded me a view
of his life before

13:36.080 --> 13:38.469
and after he met you.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.046
You made him
very happy... Ian.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.489
(clears throat)

13:46.520 --> 13:49.489
Before I forget...
(clears throat)

13:49.520 --> 13:52.125
I've got something...

13:54.100 --> 13:55.294
Ah.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.321
Here it is.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.368
First edition.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.936
Signed.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.905
The first play you ever
saw Alistair in,

14:05.940 --> 14:07.532
if I'm not mistaken.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.504
His Vladimir was
qUIte riveting.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.871
He would want you to have it.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.241
Thank you.

14:17.620 --> 14:20.589
You have questions, I can tell.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.994
It had been a month
since I'd seen him, so...

14:28.030 --> 14:30.089
How was he?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.166
He was happy.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.236
Pink of health.

14:34.270 --> 14:37.307
Just finished rehearsing
for a new production.

14:37.340 --> 14:41.106
A small theater but a big role.

14:41.140 --> 14:43.472
He was looking forward to
being back on the boards.

14:43.510 --> 14:45.239
Nothing unusual?

14:45.280 --> 14:46.372
No.

14:46.410 --> 14:47.616
What about Jeremy?

14:49.050 --> 14:51.189
What about Jeremy?

14:51.220 --> 14:53.518
Well, had you seen him recently?

14:56.190 --> 14:58.658
You know how it was
between them.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.089
Yes, I do.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.995
That's why I'm asking.

15:02.030 --> 15:04.965
They had dinner
about a week ago.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.467
And...?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.537
Alistair didn't talk about it.

15:09.570 --> 15:12.266
Which is hardly unusual.

15:12.310 --> 15:13.675
Mmm.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.510
What are you getting at,
Sherlock?

15:20.550 --> 15:24.418
I'm having trouble reconciling
Alistair's passing

15:24.450 --> 15:27.954
with his...

15:27.990 --> 15:30.185
his vitality.

15:31.190 --> 15:33.158
His joie de vivre.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.953
I mean, I can't
help but wonder

15:36.000 --> 15:38.025
if there's more to this...

15:38.070 --> 15:40.129
than meets the eye.

15:42.670 --> 15:43.659
(mooing)

15:43.710 --> 15:46.031
I swear, my brother may be

15:46.070 --> 15:48.971
the stupidest smart person
I've ever met.

15:49.010 --> 15:51.046
In high school, he's the one
who got straight A's.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.308
He aced his S.A.T.s.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.318
Then he gets mixed up
with those

15:54.350 --> 15:56.511
Sovereign Army idiots;
ends up in prison.

15:56.550 --> 15:59.189
And now you're telling me
he's doing it again.
Well, it looks that way,

15:59.220 --> 16:01.188
but we'd like to get
his side of the story.

16:01.220 --> 16:04.189
Well, I'm sorry, but I haven't
seen him in almost a month.

16:04.230 --> 16:07.199
Every time he comes by here,
we just end up arguing.

16:07.230 --> 16:08.197
About what?

16:08.230 --> 16:09.754
Name it.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.325
Football, church,
the color of the grass.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.463
He hates that I take money
from the government

16:14.500 --> 16:16.138
to keep this place running.

16:16.170 --> 16:17.398
Doesn't matter to
him that our dad

16:17.440 --> 16:19.408
worked this place
till the day he died.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.136
Doesn't matter_ that
I'm this close to gomg under.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.738
That must be
very hard for you.

16:23.780 --> 16:25.543
He even has a problem
with our mother

16:25.580 --> 16:27.218
taking Social Security
and Medicare.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.218
Never mind that
he can't be bothered to make

16:29.250 --> 16:32.242
theflO-minute drive
to go Vi5it her at her house.
Mr. MacIntosh,

16:32.290 --> 16:34.656
do you have any idea
where we might find Eugene?

16:34.690 --> 16:37.329
I told you,
I haven't seen him in a month.

16:40.060 --> 16:42.221
Detective Bell didn't ask
if you've seen Eugene,

16:42.260 --> 16:45.229
he asked if you know
where we can find him.

16:45.270 --> 16:47.158
Mr. MacIntosh...

16:48.340 --> 16:51.707
Me and Eugene might not see
eye to eye on a lot of things,

16:51.740 --> 16:53.469
but he's still my brother.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.705
When Eugene went to
prison that first time,

16:55.740 --> 16:58.049
it almost killed my mom.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.479
Can you blame me
for not wanting to be

16:59.510 --> 17:01.319
the one
who sends him back there?

17:01.350 --> 17:02.476
You brother might be
involved in a plot

17:02.520 --> 17:04.283
that could hurt a lot of
innocent people.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.685
If he succeeds,
how will your mother

17:05.720 --> 17:06.687
feel about that?

17:06.720 --> 17:07.687
(phone rings)

17:07.720 --> 17:09.449
Watson.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.629
Hey. Marcus and I are
on our way back from talking

17:11.660 --> 17:13.218
to Eugene MacIntosh's brother.

17:13.260 --> 17:16.229
He gave us the address
to a house in Cambria Heights.

17:16.260 --> 17:18.569
He thinks that Eugene
and his Sovereign Army buddies

17:18.600 --> 17:20.090
crash there sometimes.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.700
1313 Linden.
Well, as luck would have it,

17:22.740 --> 17:25.538
I'm already in Queens.
I could be there in 15 minutes.

17:25.570 --> 17:28.368
Then you'll beat ESU.
They're mobilizing right now.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.401
Gave us an ETA
of a half an hour.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.247
Well, I'll keep an eye
on the place,

17:32.280 --> 17:34.168
_ and_ I'll await
their arrival and yours.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.439
Hey, how did it go
with Ian today?

17:37.490 --> 17:40.459
I'll see you soon, Watson.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.822
You don't look well,
Sherlock.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.304
Well, it's no thanks to you.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.205
Rough week?

18:05.410 --> 18:07.674
Certainly no rougher than yours.

18:07.720 --> 18:12.544
Had I known I was gonna die, I'd
have pulled up our breakfast.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.148
You mustn't be mad, Sherlock.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.852
I'll be whatever I like,
thanks very much.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.551
ALISTAIR:
So...

18:21.600 --> 18:24.262
who are we watching for?

18:24.300 --> 18:26.120
A thief? A forger?

18:26.170 --> 18:27.569
A murderer most foul?

18:27.600 --> 18:30.160
"We" are watching for no one.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.303
You're not even here.

18:32.340 --> 18:33.807
Aren't I?

18:33.840 --> 18:35.603
(door opens)

18:45.420 --> 18:48.583
Those cases... are they
what you're looking for?

18:51.760 --> 18:54.456
It's impossible to tell.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.864
No, no, wait. It's not.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.334
Uh, Sherlock...

19:32.300 --> 19:35.736
Hey! You just made
the worst mistake of your life.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.470
(phone rings)

19:40.510 --> 19:42.398
Hey. We're en route.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.704
ESU should be there
in five minutes.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.672
(panﬁng)

19:46.710 --> 19:50.214
Please advise them
to wear HAZMAT gear.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.842
Why?

19:51.890 --> 19:55.417
I think I've found
the missing anthrax.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.296
(pants, sighs)

20:10.310 --> 20:13.370
For the last time, I've not
been exposed to anthrax.

20:13.410 --> 20:15.571
Watson, you're a doctor.
Examine me. Tell her I'm fine.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.248
What are you talking about?
You said on the phone

20:17.280 --> 20:18.599
that you were covered in powder.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.413
I did, and I was.
But that was before

20:20.450 --> 20:22.543
I was able to properly assess
it, and upon tasting it...

20:22.580 --> 20:24.286
You tast the anthrax?

20:24.320 --> 20:26.584
Upon tasting it, I realized
it was a harmless blend

20:26.620 --> 20:27.951
of talcum powder
and baby laxative.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.719
But no one here
Will listen to me!

20:29.760 --> 20:31.955
I'm sorry I didn't
inform you sooner.

20:31.990 --> 20:34.857
It's just a team of
HAZMAT-suited idiots
confiscated my phone,

20:34.900 --> 20:37.994
and my coat
and my trousers.

20:38.030 --> 20:40.737
Feel free to express
your jubilation at any time.

20:40.770 --> 20:42.567
Do you want to tell me
why you thought it was

20:42.600 --> 20:44.534
a good idea to break
into that truck alone?
As I told you,

20:44.570 --> 20:46.504
I saw two suspicious men
carrying suspicious boxes

20:46.540 --> 20:48.838
into a suspicious truck.
I feared it was the anthrax

20:48.880 --> 20:50.745
and that they might
abscond with it.

20:50.780 --> 20:52.270
And I told you that ESU
was moments away.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.914
All you had to do was
take down the license plate.

20:53.950 --> 20:56.418
Look, I'm fine, but you're
still carrying on as if I'm not.

20:56.450 --> 20:58.042
Okay, you are obviously
not fine, and if I had

20:58.090 --> 20:59.580
to guess, it has
to do with Alistair.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.417
He died. It's sad.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.916
End of discussion.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.019
The lab did a rush
on that powder.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.721
You were right--

21:06.760 --> 21:09.058
it isn't anthrax.
I know.
Does this mean

21:09.100 --> 21:11.068
I'm released
from quarantine?
I'll square it

21:11.100 --> 21:13.364
with the hospital.
But What I would
really welcome

21:13.400 --> 21:15.994
is the actual whereabouts
of Eugene MacIntosh

21:16.040 --> 21:18.600
or the actual anthrax.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.062
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite convinced that

21:20.110 --> 21:21.907
we can start treating
those two targets as one.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.044
I think that Eugene is still
in possession of the anthrax,

21:24.080 --> 21:26.548
and I've got a notion
as to how we can find him.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.946
But first, trousers.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.059
My name... is Joe.

21:34.090 --> 21:35.682
Bey.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.427
Well, according to your
rap sheet, it's Kurt.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.428
Greenlee.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.951
Kurt Greenlee is a slave name

21:43.000 --> 21:45.525
issued to me _
by a corporate entity.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.834
I don't recognize
the US. Government,

21:47.870 --> 21:50.088
so stop saying it.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.938
Call me Joe Bey.

21:52.970 --> 21:56.701
Mr. Bey, we know that
Eugene MacIntosh is an
associate of yours.

21:56.740 --> 21:58.105
If you say so.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.368
Actually, I don't;
his brother does.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.843
Doesn't mean
I'm gonna help you find him.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.110
GREGSON:
We seized the contents
of your rental truck,

22:05.150 --> 22:08.449
including the envelopes
you had ready for anthrax,

22:08.490 --> 22:12.722
all 500 hundred of them,
addressed to...

22:12.760 --> 22:14.625
government officials.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.127
Yeah, I was gonna write
some letters

22:16.160 --> 22:18.720
to some so-called congressmen.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.136
Last I checked,
that's still legal.

22:21.170 --> 22:23.138
And I don't have
any anthrax.

22:23.170 --> 22:26.003
You just ran a whole mess
of tests proving that.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.372
Just some jars
of harmless white powder,

22:28.410 --> 22:30.776
also totally legal.

22:30.810 --> 22:32.607
Tax evasion isn't legal.

22:32.650 --> 22:35.073
Possession of guns
with rubbed-off serial numbers

22:35.120 --> 22:36.872
isnTlegaL

22:36.920 --> 22:39.388
You're looking
at serious jail time.

22:39.420 --> 22:42.389
I'd rather serve every minute
than play ball With a...

22:42.420 --> 22:44.752
bunch of government stooges.

22:44.790 --> 22:47.156
HOLMES:
You're quite a high-ranking
officer in your little...

22:47.190 --> 22:49.522
army, are you not?

22:49.560 --> 22:52.893
I'd even venture that you were
in charge of the plan

22:52.930 --> 22:54.693
to send anthrax
to the government.

22:54.740 --> 22:57.937
Like I said before,
what anthrax?

22:57.970 --> 23:01.804
Right. You were never
in possession of actual anthrax.
Yeah.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.400
Though you are forgetting
I was there

23:04.450 --> 23:06.577
when you regained
consciousness tonight.

23:06.610 --> 23:08.168
And When you realized

23:08.220 --> 23:09.869
that you'd been exposed
to this harmless White powder,

23:09.920 --> 23:11.444
you panicked.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.481
You attempted to wipe it
from your skin

23:13.520 --> 23:15.784
and from your clothes.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.879
You thought it was real.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.454
WATSON: We know that
Charlie Simon made legitimate,

23:19.490 --> 23:20.991
|ethal_ anthrax--
someone paid him to do that,

23:21.030 --> 23:22.850
Paid for his lab.

23:22.900 --> 23:26.666
We went over Eugene's
financial records today.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.861
He never had that kind of money.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.800
You, on the other hand,

23:30.840 --> 23:33.673
ran a very successful,
if unpermitted, bar.

23:33.710 --> 23:35.735
And I hear from the feds

23:35.780 --> 23:39.204
you're the kind of guy who's
always looking to invest in...

23:39.250 --> 23:40.945
worthy causes.

23:40.980 --> 23:45.815
Poisoning a bunch
of politicians, for example.

23:45.850 --> 23:48.489
HOLMES:
Eugene fleeced you.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.817
He sold you fake anthrax,

23:49.860 --> 23:51.680
and he kept
the genuine article for himself.

23:52.730 --> 23:56.552
Now, we may be stooges, Mr. Bey,

23:56.600 --> 23:59.819
but we are in a position
to punish him

23:59.870 --> 24:02.088
and you are not.

24:02.140 --> 24:04.700
So...

24:06.040 --> 24:08.736
...are you sure
you don't want to help us?

24:11.580 --> 24:13.138
WEATHERMAN: ...as you can see,
partly cloudy skies...

24:13.180 --> 24:14.670
(phone ringing)

24:14.720 --> 24:16.119
(mutes TV)

24:16.150 --> 24:17.947
Captain Gregson.

24:17.990 --> 24:21.687
Eugene MacIntosh just responded
to that e-mail Joe Bey sent.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.585
The meet is on
for tomorrow at noon.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.983
That's great.

24:25.030 --> 24:28.158
It will be if we can grab him
and the anthrax.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.259
I mean, we know what Joe Bey
had planned for the stuff.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.962
But MacIntosh...
no one has a clue.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.865
On the plus side, we know Why

24:34.900 --> 24:37.232
Charlie Simon
had that baggie on him

24:37.270 --> 24:39.101
the night
his pocket got picked.

24:39.140 --> 24:42.735
Joe Bey said he wanted
to take it for a test-drive,

24:42.780 --> 24:45.146
use it on a feW animals,
see how fast it worked.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.704
Lovely.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.968
Do me a favor
and catch your partner up.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.840
I called him,
but he didn't pick up.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.289
Yes, I will.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.880
He went to the boxing gym
the second we got home.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.649
I think he needed
some time for himself.

24:56.690 --> 24:58.920
Well, he and I are still gonna
have a little talk

24:58.960 --> 25:00.723
about that stunt
he pulled today.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.250
Feel free to tell him I said so.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.995
Okay, I will.

25:04.030 --> 25:08.990
(doorbell rings)

25:12.040 --> 25:14.235
I'm looking for Sherlock Holmes.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.009
He's not here right now.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.849
Do you know when he'll be back?

25:17.880 --> 25:19.745
_ I don't.
I can give him a message.

25:19.780 --> 25:21.611
(sighs)

25:21.650 --> 25:23.242
Tell him Jeremy came by.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.613
And tell him I don't appreciate
him insinuating to Ian

25:26.650 --> 25:29.187
that I had anything to do
with my dad's death.

25:29.220 --> 25:31.029
Wait, you're Alistair's son?

25:31.060 --> 25:34.120
I was.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.821
I don't understand.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.067
Sherlock said that your father
died of a heart attack.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.590
Well, then he lied to you.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.837
Because that's not
what happened.

25:47.740 --> 25:50.868
Hey.
Morning.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.673
If you haven't checked
your e-mail recently,

25:52.710 --> 25:54.211
Detective Bell says
he will notify us

25:54.250 --> 25:56.571
the moment Eugene MacIntosh
is in custody.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.815
I spoke to Captain Gregson
last night.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.818
I'm up to speed.

26:02.190 --> 26:04.658
When were you gonna tell me
about Alistair?

26:04.690 --> 26:06.226
His son Jeremy came here
last night.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.353
He was upset about some things
you said to Ian.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.220
I told you the truth.

26:10.260 --> 26:12.660
Alistair's heart
stopped beating.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.292
Because of a heroin overdose,

26:14.340 --> 26:16.900
a massive heroin overdose.
I know that he was found

26:16.940 --> 26:19.363
with a needle in his arm.
I know it all.
Well, good for you.

26:19.410 --> 26:22.277
It must be nice, knowing it all.
I myself do not.

26:25.950 --> 26:28.976
(sighs)
You lied. Why?
You were unaware

26:29.020 --> 26:30.715
of Alistair's history.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.047
In accordance with the
traditions of the Program,

26:32.090 --> 26:34.354
I felt obligated
to protect his privacy.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.756
I don't believe you.
Well, I don't care
that you don't believe me.

26:36.790 --> 26:38.655
Well, I do care that you almost
got yourself killed last night.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.226
And I know that Jeremy cares
that you left

26:40.260 --> 26:43.889
Ian wondering if he was the
reason why Alistair overdosed.

26:43.930 --> 26:45.966
Jeremy never forgave Alistair
for leaving his mother.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.093
He went ten years without even
speaking to the man.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.358
That's not really
what's bothering you, right?

26:53.940 --> 26:55.771
As you know,

26:55.810 --> 26:57.641
Alistair and I became
friends when, uh....

26:57.680 --> 26:58.977
when I was quite young.

26:59.010 --> 27:01.843
His addiction was a thing
of the past.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.313
Mine was a thing of the future.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.147
I didn't even know
about his difficulties

27:05.190 --> 27:07.010
until-until much later.

27:07.050 --> 27:08.756
For the first decade
of our relationship,

27:08.790 --> 27:10.257
we didn't discuss it.

27:10.290 --> 27:12.758
When I began
my own misadventures

27:12.790 --> 27:15.725
with chemical dependence,

27:15.760 --> 27:18.763
he tried to warn me;
I didn't listen.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.735
Nevertheless, he welcomed me
with open arms

27:21.770 --> 27:23.761
when I showed up on his doorstep
in New York,

27:23.810 --> 27:25.402
just brimming with opiates.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.135
He told me about that.

27:27.170 --> 27:29.309
Most recovering addicts
would not have taken the risk.

27:29.340 --> 27:31.740
Mmm.
He wasn't most addicts.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.145
He had 30 years under his belt.

27:33.180 --> 27:34.408
30 years.

27:34.450 --> 27:37.339
Can you even imagine...

27:37.380 --> 27:39.780
(sighs)

27:42.460 --> 27:44.428
I just wanted
to know What it was.

27:44.460 --> 27:48.226
Was it... was it a fight?
An affair?

27:49.860 --> 27:53.830
IfI can identify
the trigger, maybe...

27:53.870 --> 27:55.292
My rational brain tells me

27:55.340 --> 27:59.231
that relapse is-is always a risk
for any addict.

27:59.270 --> 28:00.931
Of course.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.071
But his death is, um...

28:07.110 --> 28:08.816
blindsided me.

28:08.850 --> 28:12.946
And it bothers me
that it bothers me.

28:13.990 --> 28:16.151
He was your friend.

28:19.860 --> 28:23.728
Next month,
I'll have two years sober.

28:25.030 --> 28:28.238
Alistair was sober
for over three decades.

28:32.210 --> 28:35.771
You know, in time, I would have
discussed this With you.

28:35.810 --> 28:38.449
Every bit of it.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.347
I just need to try and...

28:44.220 --> 28:46.745
(phone ringing)

28:50.120 --> 28:51.451
It's Captain Gregson.

28:51.490 --> 28:52.980
Captain.

28:53.030 --> 28:54.918
I thought you should know
the meet is off.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.791
We found Eugene
without Bey's help.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.366
How?

28:58.400 --> 29:00.425
He showed up at his brother's
dairy farm this morning.

29:00.470 --> 29:03.132
They fought and the brother
ended up shooting him.

29:03.170 --> 29:05.001
Eugene is dead.

29:13.150 --> 29:15.368
I shot my brother
because I had to.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.218
He didn't leave me any choice.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.253
The DA. from your county
seems to agree with you.

29:21.290 --> 29:24.259
You said he came to the farm
around 3:00 am?

29:24.290 --> 29:26.224
The perimeter alarm went off.

29:26.260 --> 29:29.923
Uh, I got out of bed,
grabbed my rifle,

29:29.960 --> 29:31.962
went out to take
a look around.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.195
I found Eugene in the barn.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.196
He was wearing goggles.

29:36.240 --> 29:39.801
He had a mask over his mouth,
like, uh, doctors wear.

29:39.840 --> 29:43.970
And he was dumping some kind
of powder into the cattle feed.

29:44.010 --> 29:46.376
And I knew it was that anthrax
you told me about.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.810
Then What happened?

29:48.850 --> 29:50.511
He wanted to infect the cows

29:50.550 --> 29:53.485
so that their milk would_infect
anyone who drank it.

29:53.520 --> 29:59.254
I-I said we were talking
about innocent people, kids.

29:59.290 --> 30:02.521
I said, "Stop.
I'm not gonna let you do this."

30:02.560 --> 30:06.269
But he just ranted at me,
like he always does.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.495
Big government nonsense and...

30:08.540 --> 30:11.134
I was a slave
to the system.

30:11.170 --> 30:14.139
He went for his gun, and...

30:14.180 --> 30:16.136
that's when H...

30:16.180 --> 30:19.445
Is this the weapon
you saw?

30:19.480 --> 30:22.176
Ballistics
idenﬂﬁedit

30:22.220 --> 30:25.439
as the gun used to kill
Charlie Simon in his lab,
three days ago.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.311
Looks like you did
what you had to do.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.553
Before we let you go,
Mr. MacIntosh,

30:31.590 --> 30:34.297
did your brother
say anything about Where

30:34.330 --> 30:36.594
the rest of the anthrax is?

30:36.630 --> 30:40.168
'Cause the Feds only got
about 20 pounds at the farm,

30:40.200 --> 30:43.067
and we think he took twice
that from Charlie Simon.

30:43.100 --> 30:46.069
Uh... I don't know.

30:46.110 --> 30:49.273
Uh, he said something
about friends up north

30:49.310 --> 30:51.301
and that ours wasn't
the only government

30:51.350 --> 30:53.375
that needed
to be taught a lesson.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.220
Another government,
friends up north--

31:04.260 --> 31:06.888
you got to figure Eugene was
talking about Canada, right?

31:06.930 --> 31:08.227
Well, antiestablishmentarianism

31:08.260 --> 31:10.194
is hardly restricted
to these colonies.

31:10.230 --> 31:11.424
I'll reach out to the FBI

31:11.470 --> 31:13.119
and the Canadian Intelligence
Service,

31:13.170 --> 31:15.331
have them send files
on every radical right-wing

31:15.370 --> 31:18.259
organization in the Northeast--
militias, hate groups,

31:18.310 --> 31:21.438
quilting circles,
if they fit the profile.

31:23.710 --> 31:25.268
(sighs) Okay.

31:25.310 --> 31:28.074
I have been over my half
of the files twice now.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.247
I cannot find anything
that connects these groups

31:30.280 --> 31:33.579
with Eugene MacIntosh
or anthrax.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.110
What about you?

31:35.160 --> 31:37.116
Actually, I haven't
opened a single one.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.457
Why not?

31:38.490 --> 31:41.197
Eugene MacIntosh's rash.

31:42.630 --> 31:45.463
The ring finger
of his left hand.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.627
Happens sometimes
to newly married men.

31:47.670 --> 31:50.230
Not used to wearing a ring,
dermatitis sets in.

31:50.270 --> 31:52.568
But we've been over Eugene's
background over a dozen times.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.498
There is no record
of any marriage.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.371
Not in New York, no.
But a review

31:56.410 --> 31:58.173
of state wedding registries
reveals

31:58.210 --> 32:00.474
that he married a woman
named Georgeanna Wheatley

32:00.510 --> 32:02.478
several weeks ago in Delaware.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.215
The papenNork
is still making its way

32:04.250 --> 32:06.184
past the usual
bureaucratic hurdles.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.450
I phoned the widow Wheatley
over an hour ago,

32:08.490 --> 32:10.310
and she confirmed the marriage.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.352
But she also insisted that _
Eugene's antigovernment leanings

32:13.390 --> 32:15.597
were a thing of the past,
that he had distanced himself

32:15.630 --> 32:17.450
from the Sovereign Army
and their philosophies

32:17.500 --> 32:18.990
while he was in prison.

32:19.030 --> 32:20.463
That's interesting, I guess.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.661
But obviously
he was lying to her.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.668
Not obviously, no.
She also confirmed

32:24.710 --> 32:26.337
that they were married
by a justice of the peace

32:26.370 --> 32:28.736
at a state courthouse.
I ask you, Watson,

32:28.780 --> 32:30.532
what self-respecting
domestic terrorist

32:30.580 --> 32:32.207
allows the government
to play such a large role

32:32.250 --> 32:33.547
in his wedding?

32:33.580 --> 32:35.673
Anwar al-Awlaki counseled
9/11 hijackers

32:35.720 --> 32:36.675
and slept with prostitutes.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.517
Hypocrisy happens.

32:38.550 --> 32:40.689
What about sudden stupidity?
Does that also just happen?

32:40.720 --> 32:41.687
According
to his brother,

32:41.720 --> 32:43.517
Eugene was a very bright man.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.154
So Why does a bright man abandon
a sound, if derivative, plan

32:46.190 --> 32:47.384
to send anthrax through the mail

32:47.430 --> 32:49.694
in favor
of poisoning dairy cows?

32:49.730 --> 32:52.369
His brother told us: Eugene
wanted people to drink the milk.

32:52.400 --> 32:56.029
Moronic. Any number of people
could have discovered

32:56.070 --> 32:57.560
the cows' infection before
that milk made it to market--

32:57.600 --> 33:00.103
farmhands, inspectors,
his brother.

33:00.140 --> 33:02.370
So he didn't want to infect
people With anthrax the way

33:02.410 --> 33:04.469
that you would've.
What does that have
to do with...

33:06.750 --> 33:09.241
I apologize.
(clears throat)

33:10.680 --> 33:12.614
(sighs)

33:19.830 --> 33:21.457
Hmm...

33:21.500 --> 33:23.798
That didn't solve anything.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.593
Weird, right?

33:25.630 --> 33:28.497
You know what else it
won't solve? Alistair.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.235
You know why he used
drugs last week?

33:30.270 --> 33:32.500
Because he was an addict,
just like you.

33:32.540 --> 33:34.371
I'm sorry he's gone,
but his relapsing

33:34.410 --> 33:36.628
doesn't change a thing for you;
not one single thing.

33:36.680 --> 33:40.070
You woke up today,
you didn't use drugs,
just like yesterday.

33:40.110 --> 33:41.646
You know what you
have to do tomorrow?

33:41.680 --> 33:43.648
Wake up and
not use drugs.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.784
That is just how it is;
that is how it's going to be.

33:45.820 --> 33:48.118
Thank you. Are you quite
finished telling me
things I already know?

33:48.160 --> 33:49.752
Are you ready to start
acting like you know them?

33:49.790 --> 33:51.621
I've decided I'm quite
ashamed of my behavior

33:51.660 --> 33:53.287
over the last few days,
all right?

33:53.330 --> 33:55.150
I took the passing
of a dear friend,

33:55.200 --> 33:57.498
_and I twisted it into
an indulgence in narCI55ism.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.566
It's left me in a mood.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.234
Alistair was a friend.

34:03.270 --> 34:04.828
One of only a handful.

34:04.870 --> 34:06.406
And-and-and...

34:06.440 --> 34:09.170
losing a member
of such a select group

34:09.210 --> 34:11.804
has felt quite...
substantial.

34:13.810 --> 34:17.348
My tantrum upset you,
and I apologize.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.245
Again.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.758
But I assure you,
I-I'm no closer to using

34:21.790 --> 34:25.783
than I was yesterday,
or the day before that
or the day before that.

34:27.660 --> 34:31.198
If I was, I would tell you.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.691
(phone dings)

34:34.740 --> 34:37.300
Is that the captain?
It's my mother.

34:37.340 --> 34:38.762
She just heard
about some lunatic

34:38.810 --> 34:41.301
trying to poison a bunch
of dairy cows with anthrax.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.433
She want us to throw away
all of our milk.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.777
WATSON:
So now we know.

34:44.810 --> 34:46.675
Hmm.

34:46.710 --> 34:47.870
Your mother's
not the only person

34:47.910 --> 34:50.276
succumbing
to anthrax hysteria.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.686
According to the news,
people all over the city

34:52.720 --> 34:54.585
are discarding
their dairy products,

34:54.620 --> 34:57.316
whether or not they originated
at the MacIntoshes' farm.

34:58.630 --> 34:59.858
Seriously?

34:59.890 --> 35:01.596
These expired a few days ago.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.598
Her text just reminded me.
You know what?

35:03.630 --> 35:05.359
I feel sorry
for that Bart MacIntosh.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.595
He said his farm
was already on the ropes

35:07.630 --> 35:09.689
and it wasn't doing well,
and now this.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.459
How unwell was it?

35:12.510 --> 35:14.137
He said the only thing
keeping it afloat

35:14.180 --> 35:15.829
was subsidies from
the government.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.141
Remind me to thank your mother
next time I see her, will you?

35:24.190 --> 35:25.214
For What?

35:26.220 --> 35:27.812
Well, we made an assumption

35:27.850 --> 35:29.681
when we realized
that the anthrax

35:29.720 --> 35:31.756
was in Eugene MacIntosh's
clutches.

35:31.790 --> 35:34.327
That he wanted to kill people.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.351
What if he didn't?

35:36.400 --> 35:39.892
What if he just wanted
to kill... cows?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.407
Go on ahead.
I'll catch up.

35:54.380 --> 35:56.519
Can I help you
with something, Captain?

35:56.550 --> 35:58.188
Yeah, actually,
my colleague here

35:58.220 --> 36:00.313
was hoping to ask you
a few questions

36:00.350 --> 36:02.352
about livestock insurance.

36:02.390 --> 36:04.483
Yes, your own,
specifically.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.919
We've learned that you have
exceedingly thorough coverage.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.394
Each one of your 1,342 cows

36:09.430 --> 36:11.523
is insured at full-market value?

36:11.570 --> 36:13.891
Yeah, they're the farm's
most valuable asset, so...

36:13.930 --> 36:15.795
$2,000 a head, right?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.398
Give or
take, yeah.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.499
So if your entire herd
were to be wiped out

36:19.540 --> 36:22.668
by some kind of a...
bovine holocaust,

36:22.710 --> 36:26.476
you'd receive $2.68 million,
give or take.

36:26.510 --> 36:28.944
You've enjoyed being
a farmer, Mr. MacIntosh?

36:28.980 --> 36:31.585
It's hard work, but...
I wouldn't change it, yeah.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.508
WATSON: Your father
actually willed the farm

36:33.550 --> 36:35.859
to you and your brother,
so you both stood to profit

36:35.890 --> 36:37.312
from the death
of the herd.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.827
No, wait a second.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.782
I-If you're trying to say
that Eugene was planning

36:40.830 --> 36:43.321
to poison the cattle
for the insurance._..
Actually, we're saying

36:43.360 --> 36:45.999
that you both planned
to poison the cattle.

36:46.030 --> 36:48.260
I told you What he said
the other night.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.268
I told you why
he did What he did.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.234
If we'd wanted
to make money off the cows,

36:52.270 --> 36:53.999
we just would've sold them.
Well, selling livestock

36:54.040 --> 36:56.372
is, of course, a quite
difficult process, isn't it?

36:56.410 --> 36:58.378
You've got inspections,
auctions, transport--

36:58.410 --> 37:01.573
all of these are expenses
which would cut deeply
into your payout.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.714
I mean, Wiping out the herd
in one go...

37:04.750 --> 37:06.889
far more cost-effective.

37:06.920 --> 37:07.739
WATSON: Of course,
that would require

37:07.790 --> 37:09.678
an _illness that
could Wipe them all out

37:09.720 --> 37:11.358
before anyone even knew
they were sick.

37:11.390 --> 37:12.880
Anthrax certainly
fits the bill.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.557
It's only
occasionally deadly

37:14.600 --> 37:16.659
to humans, almost always
fatal to cows,

37:16.700 --> 37:18.793
and it's naturally occurring
in the feedlots

37:18.830 --> 37:20.798
and soil of cattle farms.

37:20.830 --> 37:22.491
Had it decimated your cows,

37:22.540 --> 37:24.531
no one would've
batted an eyelid.

37:24.570 --> 37:25.969
_ Your brother's time
in prison came in handy.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.807
Charlie Simon
had been a lab tech--

37:27.840 --> 37:29.501
he could make the anthrax.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.508
But even together,
you and Eugene

37:31.550 --> 37:34.314
didn't have the money
to pay for him or the lab.

37:34.350 --> 37:38.286
So Eugene reached out
to an old Army pal, Joe Bey.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.787
He agreed to bankroll
the effort,

37:39.820 --> 37:41.515
not realizing that your brother

37:41.560 --> 37:43.414
had outgrown
his radical leanings.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.928
Eugene never intended
to hand over the anthrax.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.053
And Why would he?
One anonymous phone call

37:48.090 --> 37:50.593
to the police about Bey's plan
to poison congressmen,

37:50.630 --> 37:52.598
he'd be out of the way.

37:52.630 --> 37:54.336
It's quite a solid plan.

37:54.370 --> 37:55.530
WATSON:
Until Charlie Simon
crossed paths

37:55.570 --> 37:56.730
with a pickpocket.
Next thing you know,

37:56.770 --> 37:58.465
anthrax is
all over the news.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.705
Detective Bell and I
come up to your farm,

38:00.740 --> 38:02.401
so you decided
to sacrifice your brother.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.874
You talked about him
as if he were still a radical,

38:04.910 --> 38:07.743
and you gave us the address
to a place Where you knew

38:07.780 --> 38:09.475
we would find Joe Bey.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.488
HOLMES: Meanwhile, you had
Eugene bring you the anthrax,

38:11.520 --> 38:13.010
and you killed him
and made it look like

38:13.050 --> 38:14.608
he was trying
to poison your herd.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.356
You hid the rest of the powder;
you had to.

38:17.390 --> 38:20.427
You still had a thousand cows
to slay somewhere down the road.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.690
Question is,
where did you hide it?

38:22.730 --> 38:24.664
GREGSON: We know
it's not here.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.019
The Feds and local police

38:26.070 --> 38:28.026
combed every inch
of this place yesterday.

38:28.070 --> 38:29.492
This is such a crock.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.893
I want you to leave now.

38:30.940 --> 38:33.500
Oh, we're leaving.
Not Without you.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.929
We went to your mom's
house this morning
with a warrant.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.402
Found these

38:37.440 --> 38:39.579
in her attic.
The lab confirmed

38:39.610 --> 38:42.078
it's the same anthrax
we found at your farm.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.769
Well, Eugene must
have hidden it there.

38:43.820 --> 38:46.584
But she told us he hasn't
been there in a year.

38:46.620 --> 38:48.508
She said you stopped by
last night and asked

38:48.560 --> 38:50.516
if you cold store
a few things in the attic.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.118
You didn't say
what they were,
but you were

38:52.160 --> 38:54.048
very specific that she
shouldn't touch them.

38:54.090 --> 38:56.991
According to his Wife, Eugene
learned a few things in prison.

38:58.430 --> 39:00.694
Let's see how you fare.

39:18.650 --> 39:22.450
Sherlock Holmes, when did
you become such a clich?

39:24.160 --> 39:27.652
Standing over a grave,
head heaw with dark thoughts.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.459
If this were a scene in a play,

39:33.500 --> 39:36.367
I'd have refused to perform it.

39:38.570 --> 39:40.709
I was on my way
to a meeting.

39:40.740 --> 39:43.903
I'm supposed to speak,
you know.

39:45.210 --> 39:47.770
Well, I thought this
would be a good place

39:47.810 --> 39:49.812
to collect my thoughts.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.886
I'm sorry I let you down.

39:58.590 --> 40:00.455
You didn't let me down.

40:03.730 --> 40:07.188
What you did has got
nothing to do with me.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.733
I understand that.

40:13.810 --> 40:16.404
Came here today
because, um...

40:17.780 --> 40:20.647
...because I loved
you very much.

40:27.150 --> 40:30.654
(voice breaking):
And I wanted you to know
that you'll be missed.

40:34.730 --> 40:38.461
"At me too _
someone is looking,

40:38.500 --> 40:40.525
"at me too...

40:40.570 --> 40:43.767
"someone is saying,
he is sleeping...

40:43.800 --> 40:46.507
"he knows nothing...

40:46.540 --> 40:48.804
let him sleep on."

40:50.810 --> 40:53.540
