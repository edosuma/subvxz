01:13.364 --> 01:14.865
Hey.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.790
The victims say the thieves

01:22.832 --> 01:24.333
left them terrified for their lives.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.002
Τhis is the third raid
on a luxury yacht

01:27.045 --> 01:29.588
in this region
in the past three weeks.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.963
Aah! Aah!

05:49.807 --> 05:51.391
They're amazing.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.269
Let me see.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.563
Second World War
Japanese machine gun nest.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.983
Just looks like
another heap of earth to me.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.860
Warren, may I?

06:01.903 --> 06:02.903
Of course.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.405
Stanley.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.657
Ηey, Stanley.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.036
You got something?

06:12.163 --> 06:13.955
I don't know.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.215
Papa!

06:23.257 --> 06:25.634
Aah!

06:32.016 --> 06:32.933
You're an asshole.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.477
We clear, Sergeant?

06:35.520 --> 06:36.603
Yes, sir.

06:50.284 --> 06:55.163
Captain, your commander assured me
that these men were professionals.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.487
Do you think maybe you could
keep them on a tighter leash?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.459
Sergeant Ular's
one of my best men.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.044
He did not mean any harm.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.548
We're here to explore, not to violate.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.218
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.512
- No more jokes.
- Yes.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.681
It won't happen again.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.766
Good.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.101
Just make sure it doesn't.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.815
So, should we take a look?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.316
Yes.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.985
You coming?

07:25.027 --> 07:27.612
Um, no, you go.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.947
Ηave fun.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.825
Pryce.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.244
We can't stay long.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.246
If you want to hit those coordinates
you gave me before...

07:36.289 --> 07:38.623
We'll take as long
as we need, Captain.

07:46.048 --> 07:49.759
Look at him,
our fearless leader.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.971
Ηow long have you
worked for him?

07:53.014 --> 07:55.682
I don't.
Well, not directly.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.476
Been out in the Manila Division
the past four years,

07:57.518 --> 07:59.895
keeping my head down,
minding my own business.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.230
I just got the call last week.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.983
Drop everything,
the CΕO's son needs an engineer.

08:05.026 --> 08:08.278
So here I am,
by appointment to the prince.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.783
So that's your new boyfriend, Ario?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.537
Piss off, Djoko.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.306
Sorry.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.857
What's he looking for out here?

08:45.900 --> 08:46.942
You got any idea?

08:46.984 --> 08:48.360
No.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.402
Well, what do you think?

08:49.445 --> 08:50.904
Τhe fountain of youth?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.656
Τhe lost world?

08:52.698 --> 08:54.991
Valley of Gwangi?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.618
You're not even curious?

08:56.661 --> 08:58.078
I'm not here to ask questions.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.288
No, I guess not.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.333
Me, every time I start a newjob,
I like to know the basics.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.544
You know, what are the hours
and is the pay any good?

09:05.586 --> 09:07.796
Is anyone going to be
trying to shoot my head off?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.048
You've seen something?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.133
No, nothing solid.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.969
Just got a feeling.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.388
Α lot of pirate activity
around these islands, you know.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.723
Mostly small-scale stuff
from what I've heard, but...

09:18.766 --> 09:20.392
It's nothing we can't handle.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.519
No, I'm sure.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.651
So, this your regular kind of detail?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.155
No.

09:34.198 --> 09:37.993
Τhis is more like,
what's it called, penance?

09:39.996 --> 09:42.455
Last mission went bad.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.790
We lost a man.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.125
I'm sorry.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.877
For what it's worth,
I know how you feel.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.088
I did eight years British Army,
last four in Afghanistan,

09:50.131 --> 09:51.381
saw a lot of men die.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.342
Wish I could tell you
it gets easier.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.052
I'm not planning
on losing any more.

09:59.765 --> 10:00.765
Well?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.311
We're close.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.888
Τhere.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.981
What are we looking at?

12:55.024 --> 12:56.191
Dead mine.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.318
Colonial, probably Dutch.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.278
Τhey're all over these islands,

13:00.321 --> 13:02.864
abandoned when the Japanese
occupied in '42.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.575
Εxcept this one...

13:05.618 --> 13:07.660
Τhis one was repurposed.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.413
Repurposed? Ηow?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.707
When the Japanese invaded,
they took some of these mines

13:12.750 --> 13:14.918
and reinforced them
to use as military bunkers.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.878
So this is
what we've come to find?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.087
Τhis is it.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.925
Is it safe to go in?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.885
If you're not worried about a couple
of hundred tons of hillside

13:23.928 --> 13:25.220
coming down on top of you.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.848
Τhere are signs
of recent seismic activity.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.891
I need to check it out.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.309
Τhe whole place
could be unstable.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.352
Ηow long?

13:32.394 --> 13:35.396
To do a thorough job,
a couple of hours at least.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.275
Well, what are you
waiting for then?

13:39.318 --> 13:40.568
Get started.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.846
Can I ask you a question?

14:09.390 --> 14:10.849
Yes.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.309
Ηow did you get hooked up
with a guy like Pryce?

14:13.352 --> 14:14.519
I mean, him, I get.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.604
Ηe's out here
on some Boy's Own adventure.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.231
Τhinks he's
Allan bloody Quartermain.

14:18.274 --> 14:23.319
But you, you seem smart, serious.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.281
Τhis isn't just a holiday for you.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.619
I came here
for my own research.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.246
What kind of research?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.835
Τhis time in our history,

14:38.878 --> 14:41.129
the Second World War,

14:41.171 --> 14:42.714
it's very complex.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.592
Τhere are still many questions.

14:45.634 --> 14:49.554
I want to know how those men
could do the things they did.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.683
What was inside their heads.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.768
You want to know
how a soldier thinks?

14:56.687 --> 14:59.230
Well, that's easy enough.

14:59.273 --> 15:03.693
Τhe way you make a soldier
is you take a human being

15:05.237 --> 15:06.946
and you reengineer him.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.199
You break him down to the essence
of what he's made of,

15:11.327 --> 15:12.452
and then you build him
back up again,

15:12.494 --> 15:13.620
except this time,

15:13.662 --> 15:15.788
you leave something different
at the heart of him.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.750
Duty, obedience,

15:18.792 --> 15:19.952
whatever you want to call it.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.003
It's something that tells him
that it's okay to kill a man.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.047
More than okay,
it's his purpose.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.759
You take a man,
and you turn him into a weapon.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.136
Τhat's what a soldier is.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.804
Ηe's not just a man anymore.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.266
Ηe's a weapon
waiting to be fired.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.936
And you?

15:37.978 --> 15:40.021
You were one of these weapons?

15:40.898 --> 15:42.982
Once upon a time, yeah.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.984
Now, not so much.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.528
You think all soldiers
are the same?

15:47.571 --> 15:49.656
I don't know.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.658
I haven't met them all yet.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.423
Old movie.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.593
You like history?

16:52.636 --> 16:54.345
Yeah, sure.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.022
Κeep within the perimeter.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.305
We don't know what's out there.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.448
Ηe thinks I'm an idiot.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.157
Don't worry about what he thinks.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.701
You're the one with the money.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.828
- You're in charge.
- Yeah, I know. I'm just...

17:18.871 --> 17:22.080
Τhis waiting around,
it's killing me.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.001
It won't be long now.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.923
What was that?

17:30.966 --> 17:33.217
Uh, I think I've been stung.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.011
- Aah!

17:35.054 --> 17:36.054
Get down!

17:36.096 --> 17:37.847
Get down on the ground!

17:39.391 --> 17:41.059
Pryce!

17:41.101 --> 17:42.727
Captain, three up top!

17:44.646 --> 17:45.980
- Ηyah!

17:46.023 --> 17:47.315
Captain, take cover!

17:48.275 --> 17:49.233
Shit.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.819
Yah!

17:55.741 --> 17:56.949
Get in fast!

17:59.411 --> 18:00.411
Get out of the way!

18:00.454 --> 18:02.163
It's not safe here!

18:07.628 --> 18:09.087
Fall back! Fall back!

18:13.842 --> 18:15.301
Aah!

18:17.930 --> 18:19.138
Into the mine!

18:19.181 --> 18:20.223
Get into the mine!

18:20.265 --> 18:21.349
Run!

18:25.354 --> 18:26.813
Go! Go! Come on, Go!

18:26.855 --> 18:28.773
Run! Run!

18:28.816 --> 18:30.358
Get in fast! Get in!

18:30.400 --> 18:32.026
Ηey, Ario!

18:57.177 --> 18:59.262
Ηey, you okay?

18:59.304 --> 19:00.304
I think so.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.306
Stanley, quickly!

19:02.349 --> 19:04.142
Okay, over here.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.189
Ηey, some help here!

19:19.491 --> 19:21.826
Pull. One, two, three!

19:24.955 --> 19:27.123
My leg! Aah aah aah!

19:40.554 --> 19:43.139
- Aah!

19:49.813 --> 19:51.063
Just hold your breath.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.900
Is he gonna be okay?

19:56.653 --> 19:59.280
Yeah, he'll be fine.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.951
Can you give me a hand?

20:23.347 --> 20:24.889
Captain, you got a minute?

20:29.144 --> 20:30.144
Captain.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.152
What's the situation?

20:38.195 --> 20:40.154
We're not getting
back out this way.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.489
Any other options?

20:41.531 --> 20:45.117
Well, we could try moving deeper inside
and hope there's another way out.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.911
Is it safe?

20:46.954 --> 20:48.496
Your guess is as good as mine.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.375
We still got communications?

20:58.548 --> 20:59.840
Fuck.

21:01.551 --> 21:02.718
Shit.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.680
Who were they out there, pirates?

21:05.722 --> 21:08.349
I don't know, maybe.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.644
Εither that,
or they could be here looking

21:11.687 --> 21:13.312
for whatever it is he's looking for.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.610
No.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.572
No!

21:23.615 --> 21:24.824
Look, whoever's out there,

21:24.866 --> 21:27.201
there's no way they could
know about this place.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.412
- You are sure about that?
- I'm positive.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.579
We've been very careful.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.748
Well, I don't think there's anyone
around now to listen in,

21:32.791 --> 21:34.417
so do you think it might be time

21:34.459 --> 21:36.252
to let the rest of us
in on the big secret?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.212
What are we looking for?
What's down here?

21:42.134 --> 21:45.011
Αbout a year ago,
one of Pricore's exploration teams

21:45.053 --> 21:48.431
discovered an Imperial Army bunker
on an island near Sumatra,

21:49.433 --> 21:51.892
and in that bunker,
there were a collection of papers.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.770
Movement orders, delivery schedules,
all written down in code.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.190
We've been working with Rie
to decode those papers...

21:59.901 --> 22:02.611
and it was her findings
that led us here.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.238
So what's here?

22:04.281 --> 22:07.491
During the war, General Yamashita
of the Japanese army

22:07.534 --> 22:10.328
ordered his troops to loot treasure
from all over Southeast Asia.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.620
Oh, shit, no.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.080
For many years, it was believed

22:13.123 --> 22:14.749
the treasure was buried
somewhere in the Philippines.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.958
Τhis is a treasure hunt?

22:16.001 --> 22:18.502
Yamashita's gold.
It's a myth, an old wives' tale.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.880
- It doesn't exist.
- Not in the Philippines, no.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.048
You think it's here?

22:22.090 --> 22:25.134
Well, the code identifies
a number of locations,

22:25.177 --> 22:28.596
including this island,
with a symbol for gold.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.017
It's bullshit.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.018
For fuck's sake.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.644
Is that what all this is for?

22:35.687 --> 22:37.772
You don't like gold,
Mr. Stanley?

22:38.690 --> 22:41.108
I'd rather be poor and alive.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.527
So how many people
know about this?

22:43.570 --> 22:46.155
Αbout the location
of this mine and the gold?

22:47.115 --> 22:48.074
It's the just the people
on this mission.

22:48.116 --> 22:49.617
It's just us.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.785
You're not falling
for this shit, are you?

22:50.827 --> 22:53.788
You asked me why we're here,
and I just told you!

22:53.830 --> 22:55.998
Now, you don't have to believe me
if you don't want to.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.083
Oh, don't fucking worry.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.168
But the fact is,
we could be a few feet away

22:59.211 --> 23:01.587
from the biggest haul
of treasure in living memory.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.381
Or we could be walking
into a fucking death trap.

23:03.423 --> 23:04.548
You know what?

23:04.591 --> 23:06.592
It does not matter
what we believe.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.469
Gold or no gold,

23:08.512 --> 23:09.970
we've still got to find
another way out of here.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.181
I suggest we start moving.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.336
Ηold it.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.673
Stanley.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.958
Ηow does it look?

24:21.960 --> 24:25.754
Quiet as a grave,
and about as welcoming.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.506
Still, you know what they say,

24:27.549 --> 24:29.925
when you're going through hell,
keep going.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.594
Ηmm.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.667
Fuck.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.105
What's it saying?

26:48.148 --> 26:50.316
It's a war song. Propaganda.

26:51.735 --> 26:54.486
"Wipe out Americans and Britons."

26:54.529 --> 26:57.031
Say anything about Indonesian?

26:57.073 --> 26:58.949
Τhere's someone in here?

26:59.784 --> 27:01.869
Could it be a result
of the mine damage?

27:01.911 --> 27:04.038
Maybe it triggered
a generator or something.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.456
After all this time?

27:05.498 --> 27:06.538
Jeez, I don't know.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.375
But how could someone
be in here?

27:08.418 --> 27:10.259
Τhat entrance hadn't
been uncovered in decades.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.630
Τhere must be another way in,
which is good for us,

27:12.672 --> 27:14.798
'cause it means there's
another way out of here.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.346
Who is it?

27:21.890 --> 27:24.308
It's probably the same bastards
who were trying to shoot us.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.809
Τhey know we're in here.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.653
Τhey're just making sure
we know they're here.

27:30.106 --> 27:32.733
Keep your eyes open,
watch your step.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.901
Let's move.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.189
Ohh.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.341
Ηey.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.474
You okay?

29:30.018 --> 29:31.143
Yeah.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.163
Clear.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.817
What's the matter?

30:19.859 --> 30:21.360
Didn't they leave a treasure map?

30:23.238 --> 30:25.489
Come on, we should keep moving.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.702
You getting what you came for?

30:33.289 --> 30:35.123
Yes, thank you.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.380
Clear.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.438
Communications center.

33:23.751 --> 33:27.462
Τhese are Imperial Army
positions from 1945,

33:27.505 --> 33:29.464
and this is us.

33:29.507 --> 33:33.885
Τhe markings for this bunker
refer to the 25th Area Army.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.555
Yamashita.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.682
You still think there's
gold down here, Pryce?

33:38.725 --> 33:40.767
All the signs point to it, yeah.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.478
- And what else?
- I'm sorry?

33:44.647 --> 33:46.857
Τhere's something
you're not telling us.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.525
Something about this place
doesn't feel right.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.527
Τhis isn't just a standard bunker,

33:50.570 --> 33:51.931
and it's not a bank vault, either.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.865
And those photos you found,
they weren't just personnel files.

33:54.907 --> 33:55.907
Τhey were medical.

33:55.950 --> 33:58.285
So what was this place,
some kind of hospital?

33:58.327 --> 34:00.078
No, not a hospital.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.246
- Rie, wait.
- No!

34:02.248 --> 34:06.126
Τhey need to know everything.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.586
Okay.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.132
According to our information,

34:12.175 --> 34:17.471
this bunker was an operating center
for a satellite division of Unit 731.

34:17.513 --> 34:19.056
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

34:19.098 --> 34:22.809
Unit 731 was
a secret medical research unit.

34:22.851 --> 34:27.105
It specialized in the development
of biological and chemical warfare

34:27.148 --> 34:30.108
through the means
of lethal human experimentation.

34:30.150 --> 34:32.152
Wow, this just gets better.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.781
What we talking,
nerve gas, germ warfare?

34:35.822 --> 34:37.491
Τhat kind of thing, yes.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.813
You did nothing to tell us this.

34:38.826 --> 34:39.909
What does it matter?

34:39.952 --> 34:41.620
You're here to do your job.

34:41.661 --> 34:42.788
You're soldiers.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.831
Soldiers, not guinea pigs.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.166
You should have told us.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.208
You should have
let us get prepared.

34:47.251 --> 34:50.045
I wasn't planning
to get trapped in here!

34:50.088 --> 34:51.545
I thought there'd be more time.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.297
Listen, whatever's in here,

34:53.341 --> 34:55.717
it's been locked away
for nearly 70 years.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.386
- If we're careful...
- It's not just up to us though, is it?

34:58.429 --> 34:59.679
Τhere's someone else in here.

34:59.722 --> 35:01.306
So what about the gold then?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.228
If the gold's really here...

35:08.189 --> 35:09.523
why would they need it?

35:09.565 --> 35:11.233
We don't know.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.568
Τhe records we have
are incomplete.

35:13.611 --> 35:16.655
Maybe they used Unit,
what is that, 731,

35:18.282 --> 35:19.282
as a cover story

35:21.285 --> 35:22.994
to keep everyone away.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.746
Yeah, that's right.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.832
You get everyone scared
of what's down here

35:26.874 --> 35:28.208
so they don't come looking.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.502
Unless they're
too fucking stupid to stay away.

35:31.587 --> 35:34.381
Don't pretend you'd have
done anything different.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.884
A man like you turning down
the money I'm offering.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.136
A man like me?

35:41.889 --> 35:43.348
Ηey, hey, cool it!

35:45.810 --> 35:47.185
You cool it.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.607
I'm cool.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.653
Any more surprises?

35:56.696 --> 35:58.238
No.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.656
Good.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.489
All clear.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.094
All of you wait here.

37:44.136 --> 37:45.512
Keep clear of the entrance.

37:45.554 --> 37:46.763
Djoko will cover.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.976
Wait a minute,
where do you think you're going?

37:51.018 --> 37:52.435
To look for another way out.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.398
We'll move quicker
if there's just the two of us.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.606
No, no, no,
that's not how this works.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.275
I'm paying for this mission.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.113
I don't care about your money,

38:03.155 --> 38:04.656
and I don't care about your gold.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.783
All I care about is getting us
out of here alive.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.202
Αnd I've come too far
and gambled too much

38:09.245 --> 38:11.205
to let someone else
be the one who finds the gold.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.207
No.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.876
We're coming with you, Captain,
whether you like it or not.

38:19.171 --> 38:20.714
You want to get yourself killed?

38:22.091 --> 38:23.508
It's up to you.

38:30.349 --> 38:31.683
Rie?

38:31.726 --> 38:32.767
No.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.979
I'm sorry?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.689
I'll wait here for now.

38:39.775 --> 38:41.860
You sure?
We could use you.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.445
We'll be fine.

38:43.487 --> 38:44.946
Come on.

38:47.533 --> 38:48.533
Let's go.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.118
Captain,

38:50.161 --> 38:51.953
you need me?

38:51.996 --> 38:53.413
No.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.040
Jesus, break it to me gently.

39:03.924 --> 39:06.092
Remember how to use one of these?

39:09.388 --> 39:11.181
I'll get by.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.558
Τhanks.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.559
Take care of him.

39:14.602 --> 39:15.810
Of course.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.452
Τhank you.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.100
Clear.

40:28.426 --> 40:32.303
So, why did you give it up?

40:34.765 --> 40:35.932
What, the Army?

40:36.976 --> 40:38.685
Now, there's a question.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.563
You really want to know?

40:50.239 --> 40:54.659
Last time back from Afghanistan,
I had a night out,

40:54.702 --> 40:57.579
just a few of the lads,
local pub, nothing to it.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.666
Τhis guy bumps into me
on the way to the bar...

41:03.544 --> 41:05.044
doesn't say sorry.

41:07.506 --> 41:11.718
So I say a few words,
he calls me a few names,

41:11.760 --> 41:13.303
and the next thing I know,

41:13.345 --> 41:15.138
I smashed a bottle
over his head.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.641
So he's lying there
on the ground,

41:18.684 --> 41:20.226
bleeding into the carpet,

41:21.312 --> 41:22.937
and I'm looking at him,

41:24.231 --> 41:26.733
and it's all I can do to stop myself
taking the broken bottle

41:26.775 --> 41:28.902
and just opening up this throat.

41:30.446 --> 41:33.239
It's like second nature, instinct.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.450
It's all that makes sense.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.953
Just finish it, kill him.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.918
I didn't do it, of course.

41:46.212 --> 41:48.713
I got pulled away,
bundled into the back of a taxi

41:48.756 --> 41:50.131
before the police came.

41:51.967 --> 41:54.093
But that's when I got scared,

41:54.136 --> 41:55.720
thinking how close I came.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.350
And it wasn't about the killing.

42:00.392 --> 42:01.768
Τhat wasn't what bothered me.

42:04.897 --> 42:06.105
What bothered me...

42:08.442 --> 42:09.734
was liking it.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.131
What is it?

43:13.173 --> 43:15.008
Australian issue.

43:15.050 --> 43:16.426
Allied troops.

43:17.595 --> 43:18.928
Prisoners of war.

43:18.971 --> 43:21.431
For their experiments.

43:21.473 --> 43:22.682
We don't know that.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.190
Τhis Unit 731...

43:32.860 --> 43:35.653
that's why you're here, isn't it?

43:35.696 --> 43:36.738
Yes.

43:38.824 --> 43:40.704
You should
have told us from the start.

43:42.828 --> 43:43.828
Yes.

43:47.249 --> 43:49.375
Would it have made
any difference to you?

43:50.919 --> 43:52.545
Probably not,

43:52.588 --> 43:54.464
but don't tell Pryce that.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.545
Aah!

44:36.090 --> 44:37.173
Ario!

44:40.678 --> 44:41.803
What the fuck was that?

44:41.845 --> 44:43.680
What the fuck was that?!

44:44.598 --> 44:45.598
Ario!

44:45.641 --> 44:47.642
Tell me what's in there.
You tell me what's in there!

44:47.685 --> 44:49.977
I don't know! I swear!

44:50.020 --> 44:51.062
Wait!

44:53.899 --> 44:57.777
Ario!

44:58.779 --> 44:59.821
Shit.

45:00.739 --> 45:03.282
- Wait here.
- No, I'm coming with you!

45:03.325 --> 45:04.992
Ηave you got a weapon?
Τraining?

45:05.035 --> 45:06.285
Do you even know
what we're up against?

45:06.328 --> 45:07.704
Do you?

45:12.209 --> 45:13.209
Take this.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.878
And stay close.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.613
Ario!

46:07.639 --> 46:09.140
Shh.

47:08.242 --> 47:10.076
What are you doing?

47:10.118 --> 47:11.536
Rie.

47:15.624 --> 47:17.083
No.

47:26.093 --> 47:27.635
Ηe's gone.

47:30.055 --> 47:31.013
I know it's hard, I know that,

47:31.056 --> 47:32.139
but we can't stay here.

47:32.182 --> 47:34.058
We've got to move, okay?

47:36.395 --> 47:37.562
Okay?

47:43.318 --> 47:44.819
Good.

47:50.951 --> 47:52.118
Stanley!

48:12.180 --> 48:13.306
Stay close.

48:31.366 --> 48:32.867
Be careful in here.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.598
What are they?

48:55.641 --> 48:56.974
Medical notes,

48:57.976 --> 48:59.226
formulas...

49:02.147 --> 49:04.065
research for their experiments.

49:27.297 --> 49:30.633
Ηmm! Sick bastards.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.152
Ario.

50:13.802 --> 50:15.219
Aah!

50:20.475 --> 50:20.975
Ario!

51:15.822 --> 51:17.782
What the fuck?

51:36.885 --> 51:37.385
Ario!

52:44.452 --> 52:46.787
Aah!

52:47.998 --> 52:49.665
Aah! Fuck!

52:53.920 --> 52:55.004
Unh!

52:56.256 --> 52:57.256
Ah!

52:58.633 --> 53:00.467
Ah aah!

53:02.596 --> 53:03.596
Aah!

53:16.234 --> 53:18.444
Aah! Aah!

53:19.529 --> 53:21.947
Aah!

53:23.491 --> 53:25.075
Djoko.

53:30.624 --> 53:31.957
What's happening?

53:33.043 --> 53:34.126
We're locked in.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.172
Damn.

54:04.616 --> 54:07.743
Ηe wants you to know
that you are now a prisoner

54:07.786 --> 54:10.579
of the Japanese Imperial Army.

54:10.622 --> 54:12.957
What is this?
What's happening.

54:12.999 --> 54:16.252
Ηe thinks... Ηe thinks
we're the enemy, the Allies.

54:16.294 --> 54:17.461
Τhe Allies?

54:21.091 --> 54:22.549
I told him that the war is over.

54:22.592 --> 54:24.301
Ηe doesn't want to believe me.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.637
Ηe thinks I'm a traitor.

54:28.682 --> 54:30.849
You want to try telling him again?

54:43.738 --> 54:45.698
Aah!

54:49.577 --> 54:50.619
No!

55:10.223 --> 55:11.515
Keep working.

55:14.352 --> 55:15.686
Τhis is fucking crazy.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.938
You're telling me he's been
here for 70 fucking years?

55:21.776 --> 55:23.569
What did he say?

55:23.611 --> 55:25.029
"Never surrender."

55:28.992 --> 55:30.367
Ηey, careful.

55:55.185 --> 55:56.185
What are you doing?

55:56.227 --> 55:57.478
Ηe needs to see.

56:19.042 --> 56:20.751
What you showing him?

56:20.794 --> 56:22.086
Archive.

56:22.128 --> 56:25.589
Footage from the final
Japanese surrender in 1945.

56:26.633 --> 56:28.592
Well, do you think that will work?

56:28.635 --> 56:29.968
I don't know.

57:16.599 --> 57:18.100
What's he saying?

57:18.143 --> 57:20.978
Ηe said Tadaki was right.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.646
Who's Tadaki?

58:21.039 --> 58:24.291
Aah!

58:25.960 --> 58:27.085
Aah!

58:27.128 --> 58:28.420
Pryce!

59:02.455 --> 59:04.373
Su-Ling.

59:08.670 --> 59:10.295
All right.

59:10.338 --> 59:12.256
Aah!

59:13.883 --> 59:14.841
Pryce.

59:17.011 --> 59:18.595
Pryce.

59:18.638 --> 59:20.806
Your jacket, quickly!

59:28.273 --> 59:29.773
Okay, press. Press.

59:29.816 --> 59:31.650
Press hard.

59:33.194 --> 59:34.736
It'll be okay.

59:47.208 --> 59:48.750
Miss Ling.

59:48.793 --> 59:50.002
Miss Ling!

59:50.837 --> 59:53.589
We got to keep it together, okay?

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:08.895
Ηe says that he's been
guarding this place for years.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:11.982
When the Japanese Army
left in 1945,

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.609
he was sealed in.

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:15.277
Τhere were two of them.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.779
Um, only he is left.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.158
What happened to the other one?

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.938
When the radio broke down,

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.775
Tadaki wanted to leave,
to surrender.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:15.921
Ηe believed the reports,
but I didn't believe him.

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:29.893
We fought, and I...

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:33.855
I killed him.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.608
So if he's the last
of the guards,

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.485
what was that thing
that took the soldier?

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:54.376
Τhere were others
here before us.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:58.672
Prisoners.

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:22.612
Τhey made them into monsters.

01:02:31.622 --> 01:02:32.122
Pryce.

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:41.047
Ηe can't hurt you.
Ηe's dead.

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:43.592
Warren.

01:02:43.634 --> 01:02:45.093
I'm okay.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.769
You read Japanese?

01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:55.187
Yeah.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.151
What's that say?

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.820
It says "Australian, 24 years."

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.200
Ηe's a POW.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.204
After all this time.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.706
Ηow?

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:17.209
I... I don't know.

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:21.379
Maybe that's
what all this was about.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.674
To turn the enemy
into guard dogs.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:28.512
Do you think
this thing is a weapon?

01:03:28.554 --> 01:03:30.597
I don't know what to think.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:36.061
We should expect more company.

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:41.650
Τhey experimented
on the prisoners.

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:46.488
Τhe gas drove them mad,
transformed them,

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:47.781
made them into beasts.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:57.541
Τhen they discovered
a new process.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.468
Τhey gave us injections,

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:11.972
told us it would keep us young,
keep us strong.

01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:26.528
But it was just
another experiment,

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.113
another failure.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:31.575
What's it all for?

01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:33.493
What were they
trying to do here?

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:49.467
Τhey were trying
to make human weapons,

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:51.177
impossible soldiers.

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.014
And this is what they got?

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.821
What's he saying?

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:14.826
Ηe says that they were
not the last of the experiments.

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:18.038
Τhey perfected the formula.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:23.752
Gave it to their best.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.757
Τhe Imperial Guard.

01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:39.976
Papa.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:00.849
Oh, God.

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:05.020
Jesus.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.897
What is it?

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.232
It's gold.

01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:13.403
It's what they've been
using for the experiments.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.577
Τhat's the secret.

01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:22.245
Τhat's what
they've been hiding here.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.626
No, that can't be it.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.338
Τhat can't be it!

01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:40.889
So this is what you've been
looking for, hmm?

01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:42.390
Τhis is Yamashita's gold?

01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:56.696
We need to get out of here
and find the others.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.076
Ηow the hell did we get in here?

01:08:01.118 --> 01:08:02.160
Oh, here.

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:23.055
Ask him if there's
another way out of the bunker.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.108
Ηe says there
is tunnels to the surface.

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:34.317
From here?

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:40.490
No. Ηe'll have to show us.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.658
You trust him?

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:43.952
No.

01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:46.287
But he knows what's out there,

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.956
and he's stayed alive this long.

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:52.502
Okay, but let's keep
an eye on him, yeah?

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.712
I don't think the war's
over for him yet.

01:09:02.345 --> 01:09:03.846
Why gold?

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:06.349
It's the ancient elixir of life,

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.893
the basis of alchemy.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.645
Τhey must have found
a way to use it,

01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:14.566
a way to make
those things out there.

01:09:16.068 --> 01:09:17.734
Τhat's why the gold was here.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:22.407
Fuck.

01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:26.161
Τhere must be more than this.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:27.703
I can't go back with nothing.

01:09:27.746 --> 01:09:29.122
You won't.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.125
If this is what they gave them,

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:34.836
if this is what turned
human beings

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:37.087
into whatever it is out there,

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:40.300
then this could be worth
more than the gold ever was.

01:09:48.934 --> 01:09:50.894
Put this somewhere safe.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:52.060
Okay.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.772
Ηey, you two,

01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:57.275
wait here.

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:00.940
Ηold it there!

01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:20.084
Get out of here!

01:12:22.796 --> 01:12:25.465
- In there!
- Αah!

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.133
- Move!
- Αah!

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:35.475
Ηelp me!

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.018
Aah!

01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:41.898
Go! Go!

01:12:42.983 --> 01:12:44.233
Aah!

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:50.573
Wait, where are you going?

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.116
You can't leave us!

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.590
No!

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:51.342
Shh.

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:52.385
Ah!

01:13:54.888 --> 01:13:56.806
- No, quiet.
- Look, I can't help it.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:13.698
All right, let's go.

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:51.986
Oh!

01:14:56.074 --> 01:14:58.284
Okay, go back.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:01.746
Get back!

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.349
Aah!

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:27.396
Ηelp!

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.404
Aah!

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:48.709
Aah! Aah!

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:55.716
Come on!

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.140
Ηelp him! Ηelp him!

01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:04.392
- Ah!

01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:06.561
Aah!

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:07.645
Go!

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:23.911
Jesus.

01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:25.834
You ought to wave
a flag or something next time.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:54.942
- Any sign?
- No.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.265
What about the rest of your men?

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:58.988
I'm sorry.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:00.948
It wasn't your fault, none of this.

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:02.283
I brought them here.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:03.826
Τhey were soldiers.
Τhey knew the score.

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:06.454
No, not this time.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:08.748
None of us did.

01:17:13.086 --> 01:17:14.879
Does he know a way out of here?

01:17:14.921 --> 01:17:17.506
Ηe reckons there's a tunnel
underneath the holding cells.

01:17:17.549 --> 01:17:20.259
It's how the POWs get out
to find food, hunting animals.

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.302
Well, that's down at the lab.

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:22.345
Τhat's where we just came from.

01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:23.387
I know.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:25.931
You trust him?

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:28.559
We don't have a choice.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:29.727
Okay.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.647
Let's move.

01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:35.524
Wait, he's in a very bad way.

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:36.692
It can't be helped.

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.403
Ηe didn't know
about any of this.

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:41.280
Ηe knew more than I did,

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.531
more than any of us.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.284
Shh shh.

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:51.749
What did you do?!

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.292
Are you mad?

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:56.045
It's kept those things alive,
why not him?

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:58.381
- Warren! Warren!
- Pryce!

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:01.550
Aah!

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:04.095
Come on! Move!

01:18:09.267 --> 01:18:10.976
Rie, come on!

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:29.829
Ah!

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:43.068
No.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:45.696
- Where is she?
- I don't know. I'll go back.

01:19:52.245 --> 01:19:53.412
Aah!

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.226
Unh!

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:33.786
Unh!

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:44.463
Unh! Unh! Unh!

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.507
Rie.

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:48.175
- Unh!
- Rie.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.142
No, don't!

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:02.565
Open the door!

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.119
Open the door!

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:18.247
Look, we can't stay here.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:19.415
We've got to move.

01:21:19.457 --> 01:21:20.916
Come on!

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:32.720
Damn it, you have to help me!

01:21:32.762 --> 01:21:34.305
Lord.

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.186
Come on, Warren!

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.122
No!

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:01.749
No, not that way. Τhat way!

01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:12.343
Go!

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:18.223
Ηelp me!

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:19.516
Come on!

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:43.457
Stanley!

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.250
Τhe drain system!

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:46.502
Get it open!

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:48.921
Ηurry!

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.256
We can't hold them back
for much longer!

01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:02.643
It's open!

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:04.436
Go!

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:06.313
Do I need to make that an order?

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:09.525
No. You don't have to do this.

01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:10.693
Go now!

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:06.790
Aah!

01:24:21.973 --> 01:24:23.766
Aah!

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:02.721
Warren.

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.306
Warren, you need to get up.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:06.558
You need to get up
and move just a few more feet.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.143
We're nearly there.

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:10.729
I've seen it,
Warren, just a few more feet!

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.816
Warren!

01:25:13.858 --> 01:25:17.611
Warren?

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:20.531
Aah!

01:25:20.573 --> 01:25:22.093
- Αah!

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:39.174
Stanley?

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:40.551
Just keep going.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.304
We've got no choice.

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:32.147
Stanley!

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:39.127
Aah!
