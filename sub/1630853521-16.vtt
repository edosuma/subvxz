00:01.436 --> 00:02.785
<i>Previously on</i> All Rise...

00:02.785 --> 00:05.005
Your dad reaching out
isn't a bad thing, Mark.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.224
This is Vic
we're talking about, Amy.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.531
Anytime he reaches out
is suspect.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.968
Were you serious about,

00:11.968 --> 00:14.318
- not wanting kids?
- I'm not there.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.059
When you pass the bar,
you'll have to give

00:16.059 --> 00:17.626
your client
a rigorous defense.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.062
I passed the bar!

00:19.062 --> 00:20.542
I told Andre to stay

00:20.542 --> 00:21.978
the fuck away from you.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.153
I probably
would've done the same.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.459
I will deal with Andre

00:24.459 --> 00:25.764
once and for all.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.727
Take a deep breath.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.685
Inhale the future.

00:34.512 --> 00:37.211
Exhale the past.

00:37.211 --> 00:40.779
Use the rest of your Sunday
to reflect on the present.

00:41.519 --> 00:42.607
<i>Namaste.</i>

00:43.782 --> 00:45.958
<i>Namaste.</i>

00:50.659 --> 00:52.139
I am not moving.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.618
Why don't we do this
more often?

00:53.618 --> 00:55.098
Girl, are you crazy?

00:55.098 --> 00:56.665
Do you know how hard it was
to get into this class?

00:56.665 --> 00:59.102
Oh, my God.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.843
Thank you so much
for coming to class.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.323
You did a great job

01:02.323 --> 01:04.673
and I can't wait
to see you next week.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.240
You look amazing, babe.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.111
Before you leave
I invite you to take

01:08.111 --> 01:09.808
some Nectar Studio samples.

01:09.808 --> 01:11.984
We've got a new line
of lovely items

01:11.984 --> 01:14.422
that promote the manifestation
of good vibrations,

01:14.422 --> 01:18.252
align chakras,
and faster intimacy.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.863
"Foster intimacy."

01:21.690 --> 01:23.170
Ugh, I'll give it a shot.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.867
Such a good class.
Thanks, Camila.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.564
Man, I could use
all the good intimacy vibes

01:26.564 --> 01:28.523
I can get right now.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.960
Is uh, is Gabriel
out of the picture?

01:31.743 --> 01:33.397
Hmm, not exactly.

01:33.397 --> 01:37.314
But, he's not totally
in the picture either.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.316
I don't know,
every time we go out

01:39.316 --> 01:42.276
I expect Bravo to leap out
of the bushes and fire me.

01:44.191 --> 01:47.150
Well, ever since I told Luke
that I don't want kids,

01:47.150 --> 01:51.154
it feels like he is leaping
into the bushes to hide from me.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.634
That's not a deal breaker,
is it?

01:52.634 --> 01:54.636
I don't know.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.028
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

01:56.028 --> 01:58.161
What's the rest
of your day like?

01:58.161 --> 02:00.990
No more <i>namaste</i> for me.
I've a ton of work to do.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.297
- You're such a workhorse.
- Ow.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.690
This is incredible
content for the channel.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.431
So real.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.477
Can we take
a selfie with you, Camila?

02:11.218 --> 02:12.610
Ms. Callow.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.354
Am I under arrest, officer?

02:17.354 --> 02:19.269
You're being placed
under arrest for murder.

02:24.405 --> 02:27.451
- Gonna be so late.
- Morning sex was your idea.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.845
It was a great idea,
but now I gotta go.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.240
Shit.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.024
Solicitors are out of control.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.856
Counselor.
Vic.

02:40.856 --> 02:43.293
Oh my, God.
What are you doing here?

02:43.293 --> 02:45.948
Well I'm in town on business
and I was in the neighborhood,

02:45.948 --> 02:48.777
- so I thought I would just--
- Cellphones don't exist, Vic?

02:50.996 --> 02:53.303
- It's nice to see you.
- You too.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.262
Yeah, uh, listen,
I-- I'd love to catch up,

02:55.262 --> 02:56.872
but we're running
late for work, so...

02:56.872 --> 02:59.091
I-- I understand
I'll get right out of your hair.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.919
We'll come by
for dinner tonight.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.661
- I would love that.
- Where you staying?

03:03.661 --> 03:05.054
Well, that's a good question.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.404
My hotel double booked,

03:07.404 --> 03:09.363
so I'm having a hell of a time
finding decent accommodations

03:09.363 --> 03:11.887
that aren't gonna cost me
an arm and a leg.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.019
Well, if you can't find
a place to stay,

03:14.019 --> 03:15.325
you-- you can always

03:15.325 --> 03:16.587
- stay in our guest room.
- Deal.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.683
Morning.
- Whoa.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.381
- Sherri!
- Happy Monday, Your Honor.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.731
You are like
the navy seals of the H.O.J.,

03:29.731 --> 03:31.733
first one in,
last one to leave.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.083
What do you got
for me today, Kansky?

03:34.083 --> 03:36.694
You are in high demand,
Your Honor.

03:36.694 --> 03:39.001
Ever since your face graced the
cover of <i>Legal Motion</i> magazine,

03:39.001 --> 03:41.264
I have received
dozens of requests

03:41.264 --> 03:43.353
- for speaking engagements.
- It's about damn time.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.963
- Anything good?
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.400
"International
Conference on Law."

03:46.400 --> 03:48.402
Snooze.
"The Women in Law Summit."

03:48.402 --> 03:50.360
Okay.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.710
Well, the requests
are gonna keep coming.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.712
The interview
for <i>Legal Motion</i> magazine

03:54.712 --> 03:56.540
is still on the calendar,
they're filming that

03:56.540 --> 03:58.803
"Day in the Life of Judge
Lola Carmichael" segment.

03:58.803 --> 04:01.415
Why did I agree to do that?

04:01.415 --> 04:03.417
Too late to back out now.
They'll be here any minute.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.853
- Wait, that's today?
- Yes it's today,

04:04.853 --> 04:06.333
you know it's today...

04:11.773 --> 04:13.905
Not today, Andre.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.343
Do I wanna know what the--
You know what?

04:16.343 --> 04:19.476
- None of my business
- It's your business by proxy.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.000
Yes, yes it is.
It is my business by proxy.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.612
Do we wanna
let him down easy?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.657
- Or...
- It doesn't need to be easy.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.877
It just--
I need him out of my life.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.661
Oh, cruel. I like it.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.888
Good morning, Ms. Palmer.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.803
- Mr. Biswas.
- I just wanna say,

04:41.803 --> 04:43.631
it's an honor to be
seating second chair with you

04:43.631 --> 04:44.893
on this trial today.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.638
Did you know Keurig means
excellence in Dutch?

04:50.638 --> 04:54.511
I did not,
but I will be sure

04:54.511 --> 04:57.297
to keep it in mind
the next time I'm in Amsterdam.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.387
Ironically, the use of Keurigs
are frowned upon in Europe.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.000
So, did you get the memo

05:05.000 --> 05:07.132
about the announcement
for Head Deputy D.A.?

05:07.132 --> 05:09.744
- I did.
- Who do you think Bravo chose?

05:09.744 --> 05:11.006
Hello, Mr. Callan.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.791
Big day today, Maggie.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.927
I knew it!

05:18.927 --> 05:20.798
Congratulations.

05:24.715 --> 05:28.458
I cannot wait
to be running this shit show.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.552
Frankly, we thought
you'd be a little more excited

05:35.552 --> 05:37.293
about your first case.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.903
I know this opportunity
means the world to me.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.340
And I don't want to seem
ungrateful, but...

05:40.340 --> 05:42.080
- But?
- I just thought

05:42.080 --> 05:43.517
I'd be sinking my teeth
into something

05:43.517 --> 05:45.214
with a little bit
more substance.

05:45.214 --> 05:48.086
I get it, you want to be
an agent of change.

05:48.086 --> 05:52.047
We all had altruistic intentions
when we signed up for this job.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.005
Yeah, one of these days
you will be arguing cases

05:54.005 --> 05:55.790
in front of the Supreme Court.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.488
But, until that day,
you'll have to pay your bills

05:58.488 --> 06:00.360
by representing
some people you don't like.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.363
Speak of the devil.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.236
Knock-knock.
Hi, come on in.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.803
Thank you
for coming a little early.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.587
Ms. Callow, I'm Andre.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.546
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you in person.

06:12.546 --> 06:16.114
This is Emmanuel,
Camila's boyfriend.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.116
Try not to look
directly in the camera.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.684
It takes the viewer
out of the moment. Thanks.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.991
Well, typically we don't allow
filming in the office,

06:22.991 --> 06:24.601
due to the privileged nature.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.299
Oh, I wanna tell her story.
Her struggle.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.519
All of this is going
in the documentary,

06:29.519 --> 06:31.608
and it could be good publicity.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.784
Can't be serious.
Who-- who-- who is this guy?

06:33.784 --> 06:35.525
I just wanna make
people's lives better.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.484
When a stranger
comes up to me in public

06:37.484 --> 06:40.182
with a smile on their face,
that is worth more to me

06:40.182 --> 06:42.532
than any amount of money
in the world.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.012
'Kay, well someone died

06:44.012 --> 06:46.014
because you violated
a court order

06:46.014 --> 06:47.755
and continued to sell
contaminated products

06:47.755 --> 06:49.757
- to the public.
- Allegedly.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.412
Okay, look.
Can I just be honest?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.109
I don't even use this stuff.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.285
I don't need to.
It sells itself.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.418
I don't practice
half the bullshit

06:58.418 --> 07:00.158
people pay me to preach.

07:00.158 --> 07:03.553
It's just business.
It's certainly not murder.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.037
The lightning
and sounds looks good,

07:09.037 --> 07:11.387
we just wanna make sure that
we get the depth of the office.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.867
Ah, excuse me.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.130
Another trial
media request form.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.132
For access
to the Callow courtroom feed.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.568
Another one?

07:18.568 --> 07:20.396
Yeah, don't you love
Hollywood?

07:20.396 --> 07:22.485
It's so good I do.
Oh, ah, you know,

07:22.485 --> 07:24.705
it is your prerogative
to deny them access.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.271
Prosecution and the defense

07:26.271 --> 07:28.839
have the opportunity to object

07:28.839 --> 07:31.538
to media request.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.888
If they don't I don't really
have a reason to deny them.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.150
Um.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.980
Just gonna go around, yeah.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.856
Shouldn't be
too much longer setting up,

07:45.856 --> 07:47.162
Judge Carmichael.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.130
All right folks,
listen up.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.264
I'm gonna make this as quick
and painless as possible.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.527
I wanna review the memo I sent
out regarding my policies

08:04.527 --> 08:06.834
for L.A. County moving forward.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.792
First and foremost,
we are suspending the pursuance

08:08.792 --> 08:11.099
of cash bail for misdemeanors,
non-violent,

08:11.099 --> 08:12.840
and non-serious felony offenses.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.363
We already tried this,
it doesn't work.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.539
Let's save the questions
until the end.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.715
The numbers show a good
percentage of these people

08:18.715 --> 08:20.761
commit more crimes while
awaiting their trial dates.

08:20.761 --> 08:23.459
Well frankly,
it's a system rooted in racism.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.679
We're no longer
letting criminals free,

08:25.679 --> 08:27.811
just because they're
rich enough to pay bail.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.291
And we're not going
to punish poor people

08:29.291 --> 08:30.640
who haven't been
convicted of a crime,

08:30.640 --> 08:31.989
because they can't afford bail.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.948
Mhm, fair enough.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.124
We're also putting a hold
on alleging gang enhancements

08:36.124 --> 08:38.518
and the transfer
of juveniles to adult court.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.042
Does this new gang enhancement
policy have anything to do

08:41.042 --> 08:42.696
with the recent
discovery of gangs

08:42.696 --> 08:44.001
within the L.A. County
Sheriff's Department?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.176
No.

08:46.743 --> 08:49.180
Any other questions?
Terrific. All right.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.226
Now that we have that
out of the way,

08:51.226 --> 08:53.533
I have a very special
announcement to make.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.622
Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce you

08:55.622 --> 08:57.754
to our new Head Deputy D.A...

09:00.801 --> 09:02.106
Mr. Mark Callan.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.239
What?!

09:06.110 --> 09:08.678
No. Absolutely not.
Congrats, Mr. Callan.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.375
Woo!

09:13.204 --> 09:15.293
Congratulations, Mark.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.177
- Sir, I--
- A little professional

09:29.177 --> 09:30.961
courtesy would've been nice.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.007
Guys, with everything in life,
things change.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.835
Where is this
decision coming from?

09:34.835 --> 09:37.359
Look, I gave you the opportunity
to fill this role

09:37.359 --> 09:39.491
or choose a qualified
candidate who could.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.929
You didn't,
so, I chose for you.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.887
I wrote a letter of
recommendation for Tony Carver.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.410
- Ah!
- No offense.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.499
That is the least
offensive thing

09:47.499 --> 09:48.892
I've heard
in this office today.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.415
Carver is a dinosaur

09:50.415 --> 09:51.895
counting the days
until his retirement.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.375
What's the issue here?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.682
I wasn't...
ready for commitment.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.727
This isn't up
for debate, Callan.

09:57.727 --> 10:00.600
Either take the job,
or find a new one.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.211
Now Maggie, I can assure you,
there are other opportunities

10:03.211 --> 10:05.169
on the horizon that
you will be next in line for.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.867
Don't patronize me.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.956
You just lectured us
about the importance

10:08.956 --> 10:11.349
of a quality and equity
in the justice system.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.438
Then you promoted
"the white guy."

10:13.438 --> 10:15.484
It's all performative,
no offense.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.181
- None taken.
- Are we done here?

10:17.181 --> 10:18.487
I have a hearing in 30.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.578
Well, that wasn't nearly as bad

10:22.578 --> 10:24.101
as I thought it was gonna be.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.060
The day is not over yet.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.111
Hey, thanks for marking
those exhibits for me.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.809
What are you talking about?

10:35.809 --> 10:37.767
Those are the exhibits
I'm using in court today.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.117
Wait, this--
this isn't evidence, Teddy.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.945
- It's lotion.
- No, no, I-- I--

10:41.945 --> 10:43.512
It smells so good, too.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.472
So, uh, about that,

10:47.472 --> 10:49.605
we're charging the CEO
with second degree murder.

10:49.605 --> 10:52.129
Which is unfortunate, 'cause
I'm a big fan of her movies.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.132
Oh, my God,
and I loved her yoga class.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.134
B-- b-- but that lotion
is linked to the spread

10:57.134 --> 10:58.919
of a rare tropical
disease here in L.A.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.355
Someone died using that stuff.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.183
Tell me you were joking.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.098
I-- I mean I wouldn't
worry about it too much.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.666
The Marburg viruses
only fail about half the time.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.755
But, if you find yourself
with a fever, ulcers,

11:08.755 --> 11:10.757
sores, dry cough, chest--
Oh, my God,

11:10.757 --> 11:13.803
Teddy. Just shut up!
Oh, my God. Get it off of me.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.284
Please get out of the way
my hands are poison.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.725
Mr. Watkins.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.336
I don't believe
we've ever formally met.

11:25.336 --> 11:28.165
I've been quietly watching
your work after the Camera case.

11:28.165 --> 11:32.169
Between that and rogue
arson investigation...

11:32.169 --> 11:34.215
you're making a name
for yourself in these hallways.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.999
I appreciate that.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.784
You ever thought about
joining a private firm?

11:37.784 --> 11:39.655
Not really.
The public defender's office

11:39.655 --> 11:41.439
is right where I wanna be.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.794
I feel like I just
had this conversation

11:47.794 --> 11:49.621
with one of my associates.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.319
You know, doing good work
for the community

11:51.319 --> 11:53.756
and being broke
doesn't have to be synonymous.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.627
Ouch.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.499
Hey, I'm just
giving you a hard time. Here.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.023
Take my business card.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.682
Yeah, I get one of these
for each of my associates

12:06.682 --> 12:08.553
on their one year anniversary.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.207
Wow.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.254
All I got was a $25
gift card to Shake Shack.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.125
Well, if you have my number,
whenever you're ready

12:15.125 --> 12:17.432
to make the move, come see me.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.106
Good morning,
Ms. Johnson

12:39.106 --> 12:40.542
Hi.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.070
Hey, a little advice
between you and me.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.813
You look scared shitless.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.554
These cameras
are going to catch

12:52.554 --> 12:55.731
every facial expression
you make in high def.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.951
The whole world
is gonna be watching.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.215
I'm a decent poker player.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.304
And you're gonna be
an even better lawyer.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.656
- You got this.
- Yeah, I got this.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.701
Yes.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.970
Ms. Callow, Camila,
do you have any comments?

13:16.970 --> 13:19.059
Ms. Callow will not be making
any public statements

13:19.059 --> 13:20.887
until the completion
of the trial.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.497
Would you like to say
anything to the people

13:22.497 --> 13:24.499
who fell ill using her product?

13:24.499 --> 13:26.370
We're confident our client will
be exonerated of any wrongdoing.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.069
Now please,
no further comments, thank you.

13:29.069 --> 13:32.028
- C'mon...
- Don't forget to tag her.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.595
Nectar Studio.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.249
Before we go
on the record,

13:35.249 --> 13:37.686
I would like to say
it's lovely to have you

13:37.686 --> 13:38.992
in my courtroom today,
Ms. Johnson.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.602
I'm glad
you made a full recovery.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.647
Thank you, Your Honor.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.345
As a reminder,
although I have elected

13:44.345 --> 13:45.999
to closed the courtroom
to parties

13:45.999 --> 13:47.652
not directly
involved with the case,

13:47.652 --> 13:49.567
Bravo has approved
live cameras,

13:49.567 --> 13:52.005
so you will be recorded
at all times.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.658
Back on the record.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.747
People v. Camila Callow,
the defense has filed

13:55.747 --> 13:57.793
a 9-9-5 motion.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.664
As such, I will allow
the moving party to proceed.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.362
Thank you, Your Honor.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.016
The defense is moving
to dismiss both counts

14:03.016 --> 14:05.975
in the information
penal code section 3-47

14:05.975 --> 14:08.064
distribution
of poison foods and medicines

14:08.064 --> 14:10.588
and penal codes section
1-87 murder.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.895
On what grounds?

14:12.895 --> 14:15.855
Let's go ahead and let the
defense finish their argument.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.031
Well--

14:19.989 --> 14:21.469
Ms. Callow does not run
the day-to-day

14:21.469 --> 14:23.253
operations of her business.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.994
She doesn't even
handle the product.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.997
Nectar employs an ethical
drop ship business model.

14:27.997 --> 14:31.174
State law stipulates
that the importers considered

14:31.174 --> 14:33.176
the manufacturer and
has a duty of reasonable care.

14:33.176 --> 14:36.484
Eh, the keywords there are
"her business."

14:36.484 --> 14:39.095
The defendant flagrantly
disobeyed a court order

14:39.095 --> 14:42.882
and her negligent mismanagement
led to someone's death.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.841
The issue here is that,
Ms. Callow failed

14:45.841 --> 14:47.974
to cease the sale
of those harmful products,

14:47.974 --> 14:49.976
after being ordered
by a court to do so.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.629
It will be up
to a jury to decide

14:51.629 --> 14:54.154
whether that amounts
to implied malice.

14:54.154 --> 14:57.113
The defense's motion
to dismiss is denied.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.253
Hey uh, Helen,
have you seen Luke?

15:08.733 --> 15:10.039
Okay.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.046
<i>Ms. Sawskin,
do you remember</i>

15:17.046 --> 15:18.961
<i>when you started using
Nectar product?</i>

15:18.961 --> 15:20.484
<i>Around two years ago.</i>

15:20.484 --> 15:22.834
I was a big fan
of Camila as an actress,

15:22.834 --> 15:24.967
then began purchasing her
self-help books and yoga videos.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.535
And you were also
an employee of Camila's,

15:27.535 --> 15:29.015
correct?
Yes.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.278
Were you
employed with Nectar

15:31.278 --> 15:34.020
when the original court order,
to cease and desist

15:34.020 --> 15:35.804
- was issued?
- I was.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.806
What was the company's response?

15:37.806 --> 15:39.939
Nothing. Camila told us
not to worry about it.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.680
Different labeling maybe, but we
never stopped selling anything.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.639
This was around the time

15:44.639 --> 15:46.771
that you got sick, right?
Yes.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.512
Wha-- what were
you diagnosed with?

15:48.512 --> 15:50.688
Marburg virus.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.474
I was so sick, I couldn't move.

15:53.474 --> 15:56.999
I started hallucinating,
and vomiting blood.

15:56.999 --> 16:00.394
The doctor said
I'm lucky to be alive.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.223
Objection.
Hearsay and lack of foundation.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.965
Ms. Sawskin's physician
isn't present in this courtroom.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.184
Sustained.
That's no problem.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.056
No more questions.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.928
Ms. Sawskin, I only have
a few questions for you.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.799
I was actually going
through your medical records,

16:14.799 --> 16:17.193
and criminal records,
and I noticed

16:17.193 --> 16:19.804
that you have been convicted
of fraud not once but twice.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.502
Yes, but it was
a while ago--

16:21.502 --> 16:23.808
No, I wasn't asking
about the time frame.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.506
Were one of those
convictions related

16:25.506 --> 16:26.986
to healthcare insurance fraud?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.596
I couldn't afford
my medical bills.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.859
Mm. No further questions.

16:37.561 --> 16:38.910
All those files you asked for.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.093
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.835
- How's it going?
- It's going.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.316
What are you working on?

16:53.316 --> 16:55.492
Just reading through
the transcript statements

16:55.492 --> 16:57.712
- for the Sannor case.
- With the triplets?

16:57.712 --> 16:59.105
- It's a mess.
- Nice.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.760
Do, ah-- do you wanna get
some dinner tonight?

17:02.760 --> 17:05.720
We've been meaning to try that
new Ethiopian spot in Frogtown.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.462
Yeah, I can't, I mean, this
thing's gonna be an all-nighter.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.638
Got it.
And, uh,

17:10.638 --> 17:13.902
you know, I'm kind of dragging,
I'm gonna go grab a coffee.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.773
- You want anything?
- No. Thanks.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.471
Okay, see ya.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.699
I understand that,
but my hands are tied.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.875
We're on a hiring freeze.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.616
Look, I gotta run into
a budget meeting.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.792
I will call you after.
All right, thanks.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.881
- How was court?
- I need you to sign these.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.883
Can you leave them on my desk?
I'll sign them after--

17:38.883 --> 17:40.320
I need you
to sign them now, Callan.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.278
Okay.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.978
Look, Maggie,
we don't have to do this,

17:46.978 --> 17:48.197
we can--

17:49.242 --> 17:51.809
I guess maybe we do.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.597
I want you to put me
on the stand.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.555
Absolutely not.
That's a terrible idea.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.601
She deserves
a chance to speak her truth.

18:00.601 --> 18:03.169
I can't just let an employee,
someone who I called a friend,

18:03.169 --> 18:04.953
defame me like that
without responding.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.911
Okay, first of all,
that's not what defamation is.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.826
Second, there are million things
that could go wrong

18:08.826 --> 18:10.437
if you're just up on
the stand improvising.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.091
I'm an actress, I'll be fine.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.310
Oh, we do not need you
up there acting.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.878
No, you need me on the stand,
because people like me.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.749
I can read that jury
and there's nothing

18:18.749 --> 18:20.273
that tells me
you've win them over.

18:22.231 --> 18:25.930
I'm paying you $500 an hour.
This isn't a request.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.367
You're paying us a lot of money

18:27.367 --> 18:28.846
because we know
what we're doing.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.501
Like I said, I'm not asking.

18:34.461 --> 18:35.984
No, mm-hmm.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.293
<i>Ms. Callow,
did you ever tell Ms. Sawskin</i>

18:40.293 --> 18:42.904
<i>to ignore any injunctions</i>

18:42.904 --> 18:44.123
or to break the law?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.863
Of course not.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.778
I told her not to worry.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.563
I said we'd figure things out.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.521
And what was
the conversation you had

18:51.521 --> 18:53.262
with your overseas manufacturer

18:53.262 --> 18:55.134
after receiving the court order?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.832
I was told that
they would abide by the orders.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.703
They had concerns
about profit margins,

18:59.703 --> 19:02.880
but I made it clear, I'm no
longer living for success.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.795
I'm living
to be of value to others.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.536
Mhm, did you ever personally

19:06.536 --> 19:08.451
handle the goods
that were sold?

19:08.451 --> 19:09.800
No, never.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.933
But, I did handle the criticism,

19:11.933 --> 19:15.110
the threats, the heartache,
the scrutiny, the pain.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.678
See, I think it's all about
how you treat people.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.984
This entire experience
has taught me

19:19.984 --> 19:21.986
just how fragile life is.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.075
<i>And so, I'm learning
to handle it with care.</i>

19:31.909 --> 19:34.260
Ness!
Over here, come join me.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.132
Hi, hey.
Hey, you want something?

19:37.132 --> 19:38.438
- Um...
- And whatever she's having.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.396
No, I-- I'm good, thank you.

19:40.396 --> 19:43.269
So, how are things at AQ&A.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.923
Yeah, I'm covering
the Camila Callow trial.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.926
Yo, that is big time. Congrats.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.406
You know,
I've been waiting for this

19:50.406 --> 19:52.147
opportunity
for a very long time.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.105
And now that it's here,
just kinda feel little...

19:54.105 --> 19:55.629
- off.
- I get it.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.326
I had a really
hard time reconciling

19:57.326 --> 20:00.373
defending people
who had done bad things.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.157
But somewhere along the way,

20:02.157 --> 20:04.072
I found that everyone
has good in them.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.944
Sometimes, you just gotta search
a little harder to find it.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.643
Mm, look at you,
sounding like Oprah.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.866
It's been
a pleasure shadowing you.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.739
But, I feel obligated to ask
you some of the tough questions.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.610
I would expect nothing less.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.656
Your tenure
hasn't been an easy one.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.397
It's been marred by scandal,

20:24.397 --> 20:27.051
impropriety,
and even tragedy.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.532
You have
an explanation for that?

20:29.532 --> 20:31.795
There have certainly been
some challenging moments--

20:31.795 --> 20:33.928
These things
happened in you courtroom.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.539
That would give you some degree
of responsibility, no?

20:36.539 --> 20:39.325
Actually, they didn't happen
in my courtroom.

20:41.588 --> 20:45.635
But, my main priority
has always been to ensure

20:45.635 --> 20:47.898
that everyone
who enters my courtroom

20:47.898 --> 20:50.118
receives an equitable

20:50.118 --> 20:52.251
measure of... justice.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.818
Uh, would you excuse me, please?

20:54.818 --> 20:56.124
No problem at all.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.434
Come back--
- No, what she prob--

21:04.393 --> 21:06.134
What are you doing here?

21:06.134 --> 21:08.223
You told me to come by,
I was in the building,

21:08.223 --> 21:10.094
so... I came by.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.966
- Now is not a good time.
- Not a good time.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.968
I can see that.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.361
You know where to find me.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.108
Are you trying
to get us into trouble.

21:24.108 --> 21:27.286
-"Us"?
- By proxy, remember?

21:28.722 --> 21:30.811
Now, if the people
would like to cross...

21:30.811 --> 21:33.030
I got this.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.859
Ms. Callow.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.818
I-- I-- I'm just a-- a big fan.

21:37.818 --> 21:40.690
I just wanted to say that. Sorry.

21:40.690 --> 21:43.214
You said you never handled
your company's merchandise,

21:43.214 --> 21:45.521
- correct?
- Huh, yes, that's correct.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.219
And I believe
your exact words were,

21:48.219 --> 21:50.396
"I'm no longer
living for success,

21:50.396 --> 21:52.572
"I'm living to be
of value to others."

21:52.572 --> 21:54.791
- Did I hear that right?
- Yes, you did.

21:54.791 --> 21:57.533
You also said
"This entire experience

21:57.533 --> 21:59.666
"taught me
just how fragile life is,

21:59.666 --> 22:01.581
"so I'm learning
to handle it with care."

22:01.581 --> 22:03.104
Did I remember that correctly?

22:03.104 --> 22:05.193
Yeah, I think
that's what I said.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.282
Great. I wanna ask you
a couple questions

22:07.282 --> 22:10.154
- about your acting career.
- Objection. Relevance.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.591
Can I finish my question?

22:12.679 --> 22:15.464
Yes, you may, Mr. Biswas.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.684
Ms. Callow, do you remember
playing a psychiatrist

22:17.684 --> 22:20.730
in the movie
<i>On Death and Dying?</i>

22:20.730 --> 22:22.471
Sure.
One of your character's

22:22.471 --> 22:24.821
lines was, and I quote,

22:24.821 --> 22:27.737
"Kelly's death taught me
just how fragile life is,

22:27.737 --> 22:29.783
"so I'm learning
to handle it with care."

22:29.783 --> 22:33.221
Aren't those the exact words
you just said on the stand?

22:34.265 --> 22:37.051
- I guess so.
- Interesting.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.922
Did you play the part
of a lab assistant

22:38.922 --> 22:40.359
in the film <i>Relativity?</i>

22:41.098 --> 22:42.622
I did.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.624
Do you remember
that one scene

22:44.624 --> 22:46.800
where your character
quits and says

22:46.800 --> 22:48.715
"I'm no longer
living for success,

22:48.715 --> 22:52.196
"I'm living to be
of value to others."

22:52.196 --> 22:54.329
Yeah, something like that.

22:54.329 --> 22:57.463
So, are you on the stand,
under oath...

22:57.463 --> 22:59.508
- putting on an act?
- Objection. Argumentative.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.249
Sustained.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.077
No further questions.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.522
<i>♪ If all the stars aligned ♪</i>

23:13.522 --> 23:16.960
<i>♪ And if the lighting
was just right ♪</i>

23:16.960 --> 23:19.702
<i>♪ We can make something
that will never fall apart ♪</i>

23:19.702 --> 23:22.096
- Another round?
- I got work in the morning.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.880
I better call it a night.

23:23.880 --> 23:27.101
Yeah, I'm cutting myself off.

23:27.101 --> 23:31.845
I'm throwing the newest head
deputy district attorney here

23:31.845 --> 23:34.761
a cocktail party tomorrow night,
if you'd like to join.

23:34.761 --> 23:38.417
Mark Callan,
"Head Deputy District Attorney."

23:38.417 --> 23:41.332
It's got a nice ring to it.

23:41.332 --> 23:44.292
Look, might not mean
much coming from me,

23:44.292 --> 23:46.642
but I'm...
really proud of you.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.477
I thought
you said you were done.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.913
Changed my mind.

23:59.655 --> 24:02.397
Well, I'm calling it a night.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.751
- Vic, I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.845
She is a keeper.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.326
Yeah.

24:19.762 --> 24:23.374
You know, I owe you an apology.

24:23.374 --> 24:26.769
I've been a real asshole
and an absentee father.

24:26.769 --> 24:30.077
A father's supposed to help
watch his children grow,

24:30.077 --> 24:31.644
not the other way around.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.822
And I might not be able
to make that up to you.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.216
But, I'm gonna
try to make up for it.

24:48.008 --> 24:51.315
Mr. Head Deputy.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.795
Don't you get
your own elevator now?

24:52.795 --> 24:54.405
You know,
the only thing that comes

24:54.405 --> 24:55.929
with this new position
is more paperwork.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.105
- And more paper, right?
- Negligible.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.889
Hey, you know,
speaking of money,

24:59.889 --> 25:03.240
Andre just tried
to get me to join

25:03.240 --> 25:05.025
Audubon, Quinn,
and the gang.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.330
Where do you think
that's coming from?

25:06.330 --> 25:07.593
I think it's random, right?

25:07.593 --> 25:09.420
Wasn't on my radar,

25:09.420 --> 25:11.945
but he invited me to dinner
to give me a sales pitch.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.513
Something just rubs me
the wrong way about that guy.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.384
I'll keep that in mind.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.299
Hey, I'll see you later
tonight at the cocktail party.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.866
Yes, sir.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.652
Here you go.
- Thank you.

25:23.652 --> 25:26.002
- Good morning, Ms. Lopez.
- Good morning, Callan.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.135
Can I get a drip coffee with
two sugars, please? Thank you.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.919
The usual
coming right up.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.531
Is Luke seriously considering
leaving the PD's office?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.794
Uh, not that I know of,
why do you ask?

25:34.794 --> 25:36.491
I just bumped into him
and he said

25:36.491 --> 25:38.058
he was taking a meeting
with Andre's firm.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.668
I'll put it
on your tab, Mr. Callan?

25:39.668 --> 25:40.930
- That's news to me.
- And weird.

25:45.892 --> 25:49.199
Mr. Saraf, how long
have you known Ms. Callow?

25:49.199 --> 25:53.073
We met at Sundance
five, six years ago.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.945
Hit it off, and we've been
best friends ever since.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.818
And in that time,
have you seen Ms. Callow

25:58.818 --> 26:01.342
engage in anything unlawful?

26:01.342 --> 26:02.735
Not even close.

26:02.735 --> 26:04.301
She's the kindest,

26:04.301 --> 26:06.913
most selfless soul
I've ever met.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.437
I've been following her around,
filming her,

26:09.437 --> 26:11.134
because I want
the rest of the world

26:11.134 --> 26:13.180
to know
this beautiful woman too.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.138
And funny enough,

26:15.138 --> 26:19.795
our film is debuting
at Sundance next year.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.624
So, the whole thing,
came full circle.

26:22.624 --> 26:23.843
Serendipity.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.031
Hey.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.076
Mmm... why do I feel
like I'm in trouble?

26:40.076 --> 26:42.339
Why do I feel
like you've been short with me?

26:42.339 --> 26:44.298
- I haven't been.
- And now, you're leaving

26:44.298 --> 26:46.343
the PD's office,
without telling me.

26:46.343 --> 26:48.955
Wow, is this some kind of
passive-aggressive way

26:48.955 --> 26:50.478
of ending things?

26:50.478 --> 26:52.262
What are you talking about?

26:52.262 --> 26:55.352
Andre approached me about
moving over to their firm.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.180
That's it, I haven't
interviewed or anything.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.573
Okay, so--

27:01.794 --> 27:03.665
What about you
wanting to start a family?

27:03.665 --> 27:06.102
Huh? Is-- is tha--
is that a deal breaker?

27:06.102 --> 27:08.539
I mean,
it doesn't matter to me.

27:08.539 --> 27:11.194
Okay, I take that back,
having kids does matter to me.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.458
But, you matter to me more.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.072
Really?
Yes, yeah.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.117
The thing that matters
to me the most...

27:25.644 --> 27:27.036
...is that we're together.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.435
Well, because I-- I really
thought I was gonna

27:34.435 --> 27:36.089
have to come in here
and kick your ass.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.351
Whoa.
I did.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.008
Why do we keep
doing this to each other?

27:42.008 --> 27:44.924
I don't know. I'm sorry. Mhm.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.187
I'm sorry.

27:47.187 --> 27:50.103
I was spiraling.
I was in my head all day.

27:52.496 --> 27:53.672
Okay.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.291
No further questions.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.293
It's been brought to our
attention that you recently sold

28:06.293 --> 28:09.078
an audio clip
of a discussion involving

28:09.078 --> 28:11.733
Ms. Callow in her lawyer's
office to a media outlet.

28:11.733 --> 28:14.040
How much did you sell
that audio for?

28:14.040 --> 28:16.607
Objection.
Relevance and 352.

28:16.607 --> 28:19.349
Overruled.
The witness will answer.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.482
Uhm, I'm not sure it--

28:21.482 --> 28:23.745
Like 50, maybe.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.791
I'm sorry can you...
speak up.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.357
50...

28:28.663 --> 28:29.838
thousand.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.581
Camila is getting
an unfair shake,

28:33.581 --> 28:36.671
and-- and I think the public
deserves to know the truth.

28:36.671 --> 28:40.457
We would love for the public
to hear the truth as well.

28:40.457 --> 28:44.026
The people are marking
the recording as exhibit three,

28:44.026 --> 28:45.593
and submitting it
into evidence.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.029
We'd like to play it
for the court.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.727
Objection.
This is a gross violation

28:48.727 --> 28:50.554
of attorney-client
privilege.

28:50.554 --> 28:52.426
Your Honor,
this conversation occurred

28:52.426 --> 28:54.341
in front of a third party. Furthermore,

28:54.341 --> 28:56.865
attorney-client privilege
was nullified

28:56.865 --> 29:01.522
when the client's partner
sold the clip to TMZ.

29:01.522 --> 29:04.264
The objection is overruled.
You may proceed.

29:04.264 --> 29:07.615
<i>Okay well someone died,
because you violated</i>

29:07.615 --> 29:09.486
<i>a court order
and continued to sell</i>

29:09.486 --> 29:11.401
<i>contaminated products
to the public.</i>

29:11.401 --> 29:13.664
<i>Allegedly.
Okay look,</i>

29:13.664 --> 29:16.450
<i>can I just be honest,
I don't even use this stuff.</i>

29:16.450 --> 29:18.757
<i>I don't need to,
it sells itself.</i>

29:18.757 --> 29:20.846
<i>I don't practice
half the bullshit</i>

29:20.846 --> 29:22.369
<i>people pay me to preach.</i>

29:22.369 --> 29:23.805
<i>It's just business.</i>

29:25.372 --> 29:27.243
We had an agreement
that they wouldn't air it

29:27.243 --> 29:28.767
until the conclusion
of the trial.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.118
I'm sorry, baby.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.129
You okay?

29:47.394 --> 29:49.222
You should see what
they're saying about me online.

29:49.222 --> 29:51.877
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about that, right now.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.752
I really messed up, didn't I?

29:57.752 --> 30:01.103
Well, you certainly
didn't do yourself any favors,

30:01.103 --> 30:04.280
but look, I'm not here
to say "I told you so."

30:07.544 --> 30:11.070
Um. A little bit of advice.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.593
The jury
can't empathize with someone

30:12.593 --> 30:14.073
who keeps playing a part.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.031
And if they can't
empathize with you,

30:16.031 --> 30:18.381
then you can't win,
it's that simple.

30:18.381 --> 30:21.515
And I know you are
used to playing a role,

30:21.515 --> 30:23.169
but you don't have
to do that here, girl.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.040
This is real life.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.787
Here.

30:39.228 --> 30:42.101
Okay. There, there.

30:50.587 --> 30:51.980
Will the defendant please stand?

30:59.509 --> 31:01.120
In the matter
of the people of the state

31:01.120 --> 31:03.383
of California
versus Camila Callow,

31:03.383 --> 31:05.907
as to count one,
second degree murder,

31:05.907 --> 31:08.518
a violation of penal code
section 187, we the jury,

31:08.518 --> 31:12.000
in the above entitled action
find the defendant not guilty.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.003
As to count two, distributing
poison food and medicines,

31:15.003 --> 31:17.701
we the jury,
find the defendant guilty.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.314
We'll file an appeal.
The important thing is,

31:21.314 --> 31:23.142
is that you're not
going away for murder.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.405
Ms. Callow, I'd like
to offer one last thing.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.624
When you come out
on the other side of this

31:27.624 --> 31:31.063
and I have no doubt
that you will,

31:31.063 --> 31:33.587
I hope that you would use
your platform

31:33.587 --> 31:35.676
to put people
ahead of profits.

31:35.676 --> 31:39.941
Bailiff, please remove
the defendant from my courtroom.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.829
Come in.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.309
You summoned.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.094
Thank you for coming by.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.618
Can I get you some
coffee or something?

32:04.618 --> 32:07.273
Ah, no, it's a little late
in the day for caffeine.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.231
Fair enough.

32:09.231 --> 32:12.452
Well there's something
I wanted to talk to you about

32:12.452 --> 32:15.150
- in person.
- Shoot.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.544
Now, I know I'm gonna be
your daughter-in-law

32:17.544 --> 32:20.677
in the very near future,
but I was your attorney first.

32:22.331 --> 32:23.724
Something's going on.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.508
Something you're not telling us.

32:25.508 --> 32:26.814
- Look--
- Let me finish.

32:28.729 --> 32:32.428
Now, if you need help,
that's one thing.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.300
But, I don't want
whatever you're involved with

32:34.300 --> 32:36.476
to interfere with Mark's life.

32:36.476 --> 32:40.001
He just got this big promotion,
and we're planning our wedding.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.829
He's stressed out
enough as it is and...

32:43.222 --> 32:45.311
I know he won't say it but...

32:45.311 --> 32:47.704
you showing up,
out of the blue

32:47.704 --> 32:49.358
has him thinking the worst.

32:49.358 --> 32:50.620
I understand.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.492
Do you?
Yeah.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.320
You don't need
to worry about me.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.496
I wanted to thank you
for putting me up

32:56.496 --> 32:58.759
in your place
in such short notice, and--

32:58.759 --> 33:02.067
Hell, I wanna
thank you for everything.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.939
I mean, I'd be spending
the rest of my natural life

33:04.939 --> 33:06.245
in prison if it weren't for you.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.859
I don't wanna cause
any more problems.

33:11.859 --> 33:15.341
So, I will just skip
the cocktail party

33:15.341 --> 33:17.169
and leave tonight.

33:19.171 --> 33:22.696
And please,
tell Mark that I said

33:22.696 --> 33:24.654
"Congratulations on everything."

33:25.786 --> 33:28.789
You too, counselor.
You too.

33:48.417 --> 33:51.464
Hey.
- Hey.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.553
Don't get too comfortable.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.252
Look, Dre,

33:57.252 --> 33:59.472
whatever this is...

33:59.472 --> 34:02.127
whatever you think this is,

34:02.127 --> 34:04.912
it needs to be over.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.609
If that was totally true,

34:06.609 --> 34:08.742
would I be standing
in your office right now?

34:08.742 --> 34:11.962
You're here because
I have found closure.

34:11.962 --> 34:15.314
And I want for you
to have the same closure.

34:15.314 --> 34:18.665
We both know that
that kiss was a mistake.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.536
I don't think so.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.799
Look, it's not about the kiss,
all right?

34:22.799 --> 34:25.324
It-- it-- it's about
the history behind the kiss.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.587
It's about me knowing
that I made the wrong choice

34:27.587 --> 34:29.589
when I let you go
the first time,

34:29.589 --> 34:31.765
and knowing that I'm not gonna
make that same mistake again.

34:31.765 --> 34:34.507
No, you're not, because I am
not gonna give you that chance.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.074
Hold on, just hear me out--
Dre,

34:36.074 --> 34:38.032
that kiss was unfair to you,
but this?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.688
It is unfair to me.

34:41.688 --> 34:45.257
Now, you broke my heart
and I moved on a long time ago.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.043
I am happy.

34:50.349 --> 34:51.785
I have a husband

34:51.785 --> 34:53.830
who I wouldn't trade
for the world.

34:58.487 --> 34:59.923
Damn.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.273
Um.

35:05.146 --> 35:08.149
There's a lot
I wanna say to you.

35:11.718 --> 35:15.896
But, what's more important
to me is that you're happy.

35:16.897 --> 35:18.768
Even if it isn't with me.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.467
But, I need you
to know something.

35:23.556 --> 35:24.992
That I love you, Lola.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.516
And I'll always will.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.324
<i>♪ I'm in love with you ♪</i>

35:54.500 --> 35:56.154
Didn't think it was possible

35:56.154 --> 35:57.807
to spite someone
by giving them a promotion.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.679
Bravo is an evil genius.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.073
You can save it, Callan.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.597
I know you're disappointed, Maggie,

36:04.597 --> 36:06.076
but the fact
that you showed up

36:06.076 --> 36:07.643
is a testament
to your character.

36:07.643 --> 36:09.254
You're the consummate
team player,

36:09.254 --> 36:10.820
you don't get enough
credit for that.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.388
Oh, gosh. Thanks, Mark.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.695
I really appreciate it.

36:15.695 --> 36:18.959
- You can leave now.
- Okay, that feels about right.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.222
[yawns] I think
I'm gonna take off soon.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.355
- I'm exhausted.
- I just got here.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.008
This place
was impossible to find.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.619
There are no signs anywhere.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.273
Yeah, it's a speakeasy, Teddy.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.100
So, that's kinda the point.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.625
Officers of the court
sworn to uphold justice

36:32.625 --> 36:35.236
hanging out
in an illicit establishment?

36:35.236 --> 36:38.326
Corruption permeates
the entire system.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.893
Why are you like this?

36:41.286 --> 36:44.811
No, yes,
but I have some clients

36:44.811 --> 36:46.987
who have some nice suits that
they would love to donate.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.381
I have some clients who could
use some new suits for work.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.513
Yeah, let me know
when you want me to pick 'em up.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.167
Perfect, thank you.

36:58.912 --> 37:02.742
- Aw, how did we do?
- Good.

37:02.742 --> 37:06.093
- It's done.
- I'm so proud of you.

37:06.093 --> 37:08.530
How many of those have you had?

37:08.530 --> 37:10.228
Oh, I don't know.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.361
You deserve it.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.931
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

37:17.931 --> 37:20.238
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.979
Wow, I have never seen anyone

37:22.979 --> 37:25.417
look so miserable
to be getting a pay rise.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.375
I will give the money back
in a heart beat

37:27.375 --> 37:29.159
to never have to do
another budget report.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.466
C'mon, man.
Just enjoy your moment.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.163
One day, I will learn
to embrace the suck,

37:33.163 --> 37:34.643
but that day is not today.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.864
- Excuse me.
- Mmm.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.953
Can I have everybody's
attention please?

37:41.955 --> 37:43.826
I just wanna take a second
to thank you guys

37:43.826 --> 37:47.961
for coming out to celebrate
Mark on a work night.

37:47.961 --> 37:50.180
Listen, I'll make
a deal with everybody:

37:50.180 --> 37:53.575
if you skip the awkward toasts,
the next round is on me.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.098
Cheers to that!

37:55.098 --> 37:56.883
Okay, that's right.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.928
All right, thank you.

38:12.768 --> 38:14.509
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

38:14.509 --> 38:16.555
Not at all.

38:16.555 --> 38:19.427
Congratulations
on your trial today.

38:19.427 --> 38:22.474
- We lost.
- You can't win 'em all, Ness.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.476
And you won't,
but what's important

38:24.476 --> 38:26.260
is you planted your flag today.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.044
Yeah, I don't do war or victory.

38:28.044 --> 38:30.569
Girl!

38:30.569 --> 38:32.310
Take a compliment.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.660
Look, I would be
worried if you did.

38:34.660 --> 38:37.532
But that--
that fight and spirit,

38:37.532 --> 38:39.621
that refusal to settle,

38:39.621 --> 38:42.581
that's what's gonna make you
an excellent lawyer.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.541
I love seeing
how much you've grown.

38:48.891 --> 38:51.372
You gonna start
taking it easy on me?

38:51.372 --> 38:54.027
I feel like you just enjoyed
overruling my objections

38:54.027 --> 38:55.724
a little too much.

38:55.724 --> 38:58.031
Just absolutely refused
to let me flourish.

38:58.031 --> 39:00.903
And I will continue to do so.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.733
You keep it up and I will
report you to the bar.

39:04.733 --> 39:07.127
Oh, well that's my cue
to report to the bar

39:07.127 --> 39:09.869
and get another drink.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.829
Vic? What the hell?

39:58.134 --> 39:59.658
What the hell happened to you?

40:01.442 --> 40:04.097
Starting a business,
it takes a lot, Captain.

40:04.097 --> 40:05.490
How does that story
end with you

40:05.490 --> 40:07.056
getting the shit
kicked out of you?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.929
I needed to borrow some money.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.061
Okay, I-- I needed
to borrow a lot of money.

40:12.061 --> 40:13.933
Well, I know
you didn't go to B of A,

40:13.933 --> 40:15.413
so who'd you get
the money from?

40:16.588 --> 40:18.198
The Karolinkovs.

40:18.198 --> 40:21.723
The Russian crime family?

40:21.723 --> 40:24.813
An entire generation of those
men is serving hard time.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.598
Vic, if they knew
you were my dad,

40:26.598 --> 40:28.121
you would be a dead man.

40:28.121 --> 40:30.515
They already know.

40:30.515 --> 40:34.040
I'm only alive because a corpse
is a bad business investment.

40:34.040 --> 40:37.304
Dead people don't pay up.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.524
Why did you bring this
to my doorstep?

40:39.524 --> 40:42.527
They want you
to throw an upcoming case,

40:42.527 --> 40:44.790
but it's not that simple.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.879
'Cause if you
help them just once,

40:46.879 --> 40:48.707
you'd be indebted
to them forever.

40:49.838 --> 40:52.014
So please,
just promise me...

40:53.102 --> 40:55.278
you won't get involved.

40:55.278 --> 40:56.889
No matter what happens to me.
