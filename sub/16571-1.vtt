01:00.361 --> 01:02.561
Elinore: Night light,
night bright,

01:02.563 --> 01:05.464
shine for me
with all your might.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.800
Night light, night bright,

01:07.802 --> 01:10.369
watch over me
'til morning sight.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.493
You'll be safer here,
Mr. scribbles.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.719
What's going on in here?

02:33.721 --> 02:37.189
Something's in my room.
Oh, elinore...

02:38.691 --> 02:40.459
We should wake up daddy.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.128
No, you know he has
to work early tomorrow.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.397
Sweetie, we can't
do this tonight, okay?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.666
There's something here.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.535
There's nothing here.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.403
Don't you remember
what the doctor said?

02:51.405 --> 02:53.505
There's no such thing as ghosts.

02:53.507 --> 02:57.009
The doctor's full of shit,
wake up daddy!

02:57.011 --> 02:58.177
Okay.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.180
Show me. Where?

03:03.950 --> 03:05.851
All right, let me
see the flashlight.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.294
Elinore, I don't see anything.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.931
Hey, what happened
to Mr. scribbles?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.035
Elinore, did you take my brush?

03:27.774 --> 03:28.840
Oh!

03:28.842 --> 03:31.143
Elinore, help me!

03:32.512 --> 03:35.214
Elinore! Elinore!

03:36.917 --> 03:38.784
Elinore: Daddy,
daddy, wake up!

05:48.348 --> 05:50.048
Well, fancy meeting
you here, man.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.983
I was beginning to think
that you were flaking...

05:54.187 --> 05:55.921
Nick: Tim?

05:57.557 --> 05:58.724
Tim?

06:10.403 --> 06:12.771
Hey, Tim, I didn't
mean to scare ya.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.810
Okay.
I'll come back later.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.573
Automated voice: <i>You have reached
the office of Dr. piccault.</i>

07:54.575 --> 07:57.442
<i>No one is available to take
your call at the moment.</i>

07:57.444 --> 08:01.446
<i>If this is an emergency,
please hang up and dial 9-1-1.</i>

08:01.448 --> 08:05.383
<i>Otherwise, leave a message and we'll
be in touch as soon as we can.</i>

08:05.385 --> 08:07.419
<i>Thank you and have a good day.</i>

08:44.824 --> 08:45.991
No, no, oh...

08:51.230 --> 08:52.731
Nick: Hey!

08:52.733 --> 08:56.067
Twice in one week,
I might have to call CNN.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.771
Yeah, so I was wondering
where that was.

08:59.773 --> 09:03.775
I'm just gonna go knock it
out now, if that's okay?

09:03.777 --> 09:07.279
So, I guess you can just give
it to me since I'm here.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.584
You know, I got
a couple minutes.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.419
Why don't you just
tell me what's on it?

09:16.355 --> 09:19.224
Well, it's the beginning
of the week, um,

09:19.226 --> 09:20.926
so let me guess.

09:20.928 --> 09:25.297
I'm gonna go with tp,
ultra soft of course...

09:25.299 --> 09:26.665
And...

09:27.700 --> 09:29.100
Mouthwash.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.040
Okay.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.341
Uh...

09:36.343 --> 09:39.344
It was nice talking to you too,

09:39.346 --> 09:41.947
and we should definitely do
this again when I get back.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.156
Thank you.

13:25.271 --> 13:26.571
Yes?

13:26.573 --> 13:29.407
Distorted voice:
<i>You can't hide anymore.</i>

13:29.409 --> 13:30.842
Excuse me, who is this?

13:30.844 --> 13:36.681
<i>We regret to inform you,
you have 45 days to vacate.</i>

13:38.050 --> 13:39.684
How do you know that?

13:39.686 --> 13:43.254
<i>What's going to happen when
you have to go outside again?</i>

13:43.256 --> 13:46.257
Nothing.
<i>Nothing never happens.</i>

13:46.259 --> 13:51.062
<i>Something bad always does.</i>
Not this time.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.432
I can do it. <i>That's
not what she thinks.</i>

13:54.434 --> 13:57.769
Who?
<i>Turn around.</i>

14:11.718 --> 14:13.051
Carri?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.620
Distorted voice: <i>Ask her
what's going to happen.</i>

14:15.622 --> 14:16.721
No.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.592
Leave me alone.

14:20.594 --> 14:24.195
<i>You are, but not for long.</i>

14:30.469 --> 14:32.203
Mary: <i>Tim?</i>

14:32.205 --> 14:34.372
<i>It's Mary, can you hear me?</i>

14:36.208 --> 14:37.342
<i>Tim?</i>

14:38.544 --> 14:39.944
Mary?

14:39.946 --> 14:42.313
<i>Yes, couldn't you hear me?</i>

14:43.582 --> 14:46.084
Uh, no, no, I didn't.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.053
<i>Strange, I could hear you.</i>

14:50.689 --> 14:54.325
Sorry, I thought it was a prank.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.127
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

14:57.897 --> 15:01.900
Dr. piccault missed
the appointment today.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.870
<i>I know, I'm sorry
I couldn't call you sooner.</i>

15:05.872 --> 15:08.506
<i>There's no easy way
to say this...</i>

15:08.508 --> 15:10.475
<i>Dr. piccault
had an accident.</i>

15:10.477 --> 15:12.644
Accident, what kind of accident?

15:12.646 --> 15:14.946
<i>Tim, I need you to stay calm.</i>

15:14.948 --> 15:17.582
<i>It's okay if you want
to take some medication.</i>

15:18.550 --> 15:20.885
Is he going to be okay?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.587
<i>Well, we're not sure
at this point.</i>

15:22.589 --> 15:25.623
<i>You've been transferred to a
new doctor for the time being.</i>

15:27.159 --> 15:30.862
New doctor, no, no, no, I can't.

15:30.864 --> 15:33.998
<i>Tim, we just want you
to be calm.</i>

15:34.000 --> 15:37.168
<i>Can you do that,
or should I send some help?</i>

15:49.515 --> 15:50.748
<i>Tim...</i>

15:52.818 --> 15:53.952
<i>Tim?</i>

15:55.321 --> 15:57.889
No, you don't need
to send anyone.

15:57.891 --> 16:01.759
<i>What's important is that we have
a new doctor for you, okay?</i>

16:04.330 --> 16:06.130
What's his name?

16:06.132 --> 16:07.598
<i>Dr. sephton.</i>

16:17.076 --> 16:18.977
Tim: <i> But I don't know him.</i>

16:18.979 --> 16:22.180
Mary: <i>Dr. piccault has worked
with him before, he's excellent.</i>

16:22.182 --> 16:23.715
<i>His office is going to call you,</i>

16:23.717 --> 16:26.985
<i>but I wanted you
to hear it from me first.</i>

16:26.987 --> 16:29.754
Tim: <i> Sure, okay.</i>

16:57.751 --> 17:00.184
Nick: <i>Oh, wake up, man,
please don't be dead.</i>

17:02.021 --> 17:04.055
Nick: Tim!

17:06.592 --> 17:07.925
Tim: Whoa, how did
you get in here?

17:07.926 --> 17:09.594
I came back with the thing,

17:09.596 --> 17:11.628
and the thing is like this, and
you're laying here not breathing!

17:11.631 --> 17:13.830
Man, I was gonna call 9-1-1!

17:13.833 --> 17:16.934
Excuse me, I have to...

17:16.935 --> 17:19.237
Would you mind
locking up when you leave?

17:54.140 --> 17:57.141
Oh, sorry, I didn't
mean to snoop.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.545
Um, I should probably get going.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.914
I forgot to, uh,
give you your money.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.317
Oh... deliveries on me,
get me next week.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.956
Do you need any...
Any help?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.724
I mean, with the letter.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.626
No, thank you, though.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.797
How long have you lived here?

18:20.566 --> 18:22.733
Almost 20 years.

18:22.735 --> 18:26.771
And when was the last time you,
like, went past that door?

18:28.140 --> 18:29.807
Thirteen months.

18:31.743 --> 18:34.912
Do you miss the outside
world, just a little?

18:35.647 --> 18:37.715
I can see it from here.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.283
Do you ever get lonely?

18:42.421 --> 18:43.521
No.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.590
I would.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.459
I mean, I don't think we're
supposed to be alone.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.727
Do you?

18:56.568 --> 18:59.403
All right, well,
I'll see you next week.

21:14.340 --> 21:18.042
Automated voice: <i>We're sorry, please
consult your directory and dial again.</i>

23:12.357 --> 23:14.125
Nick: Tim?

23:17.963 --> 23:19.864
Hey, hey, hey it's Nick.

23:19.866 --> 23:20.998
Tim.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.800
Tim, it's Nick.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.107
Tim: Earthquake?

23:30.109 --> 23:32.309
Yeah, what did
you think that was?

23:32.311 --> 23:34.145
That can't be right.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.680
Why... why not?

23:36.682 --> 23:38.749
Did you see anybody else?

23:38.751 --> 23:42.553
Do you mean besides me and you?

23:42.555 --> 23:44.889
No I, I thought I heard
something, like growling, but...

23:44.891 --> 23:48.359
Oh, yeah, Brett's dog got loose.

23:48.361 --> 23:51.128
Brett's your neighbor and he
can't keep his dog on a leash.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.863
Dog?
Yeah.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.936
I'm not crazy.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.806
Oh, no. Who's saying
anything about crazy?

24:01.808 --> 24:03.541
A little buzzed up, maybe.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.943
Did you, uh, open this tonight?

24:05.945 --> 24:08.379
I had one glass.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.848
Well, I don't think the
bottle would re-seal itself

24:10.850 --> 24:13.617
after the, uh,
the wine leaked out.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.555
Look, man, I'm not
passing judgment.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.590
If I was you
and I got that letter,

24:19.592 --> 24:21.258
I'd be pretty freaked out too.

24:23.495 --> 24:24.862
Oh, there you go.

24:26.833 --> 24:30.000
Well, I guess
I'm gonna head out, um...

24:31.069 --> 24:35.406
You're okay, right?
Yeah.

24:39.678 --> 24:41.612
I could use some help.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.883
I mean, with the letter.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.953
If you haven't found anything
better to do with your free time.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.727
How do you feel about
having some company over?

25:02.234 --> 25:05.870
Nick: You know, Joan, I'm glad you
talked me into helping with him.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.205
You ready to head to his place?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.740
Shouldn't you be helping me?

25:09.742 --> 25:12.843
Okay, I'm here, let's just
talk about this for a second.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.579
I think I took it out too soon.
You didn't.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.681
What if he has allergies?
He doesn't.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.885
What if he doesn't like it?
He will.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.686
What if he doesn't like me?

25:22.688 --> 25:26.657
He probably doesn't even like
me, so it'll make two of us.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.293
All right, nervous Nelly, what did
you do with my girlfriend this time?

25:29.295 --> 25:30.961
I am not nervous Nelly.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.663
Okay, you're not.

25:34.232 --> 25:36.367
He's been living
an anchoritic lifestyle,

25:36.369 --> 25:38.769
and I don't want to be the
reason he regrets his decision.

25:39.804 --> 25:41.572
Is that even a word?

25:41.574 --> 25:44.308
Reclusive.
Okay.

25:46.945 --> 25:50.481
The food's perfect,
you're perfect,

25:50.483 --> 25:52.983
and he's gonna wish
he did this six months ago.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.386
You think so?
Absolutely.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.423
All right, what do you
want me to do?

26:01.259 --> 26:04.495
Tupperware?
Yeah.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.067
How you doing over there?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.102
Joan: Good,
just sauteing the garlic.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.539
You're not gonna
eat that, are you?

26:18.009 --> 26:20.177
Mmm, nice!

26:20.179 --> 26:24.114
Is that the stuff with the
sesame, the, uh, the bernero?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.817
<i>Cavolo nero,</i> also called Kale.

26:26.819 --> 26:30.220
Oh, this looks really good.
Thanks.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.034
Joan: You don't
like it, do you?

26:45.236 --> 26:47.137
My wife used to make Kale.

26:47.939 --> 26:51.241
Oh, uh, I hope I didn't...

26:51.243 --> 26:55.112
No, they're just,
um, something th...

26:55.114 --> 26:59.383
I'm her... uh, I'm sure
hers was much better.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.753
Couple episodes of <i> top chef</i>
doesn't make me erudite.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.689
Nick: Okay,
that's not a word.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.994
I'm just saying.
Really, now?

27:09.996 --> 27:13.764
It's a word.
Yeah, I don't think so.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.232
What do you think?

27:19.638 --> 27:22.539
Means, um, having
great knowledge.

27:24.609 --> 27:26.010
Joan: Thank you.

27:27.012 --> 27:28.479
Okay, merriam Webster,

27:28.481 --> 27:31.548
I'd like you to meet
encyclopedia britannica.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.920
I knew that one.
Yeah, right.

27:44.963 --> 27:47.164
What?
Nothing.

27:49.801 --> 27:53.370
So, that animus earlier
about the food situation.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.873
Seems like wasted energy.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.375
Did you just use
"animus" in a sentence?

27:58.377 --> 28:00.110
I did, and correctly,

28:00.112 --> 28:03.547
and I kinda think you want to
make out with me right now.

28:03.549 --> 28:05.883
You think three syllables
is all it takes?

28:05.885 --> 28:08.052
I think it's
a pretty good start.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.520
I'm not that easy.

28:09.522 --> 28:11.789
You're gonna have to come
up with something bigger.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.925
Oh, you don't think I can?
I'd like to see you try.

28:49.961 --> 28:51.228
A star?

28:52.297 --> 28:53.731
Batman.

28:53.733 --> 28:54.998
Oh!

28:56.836 --> 29:00.070
Yeah, you're not gonna
get this one either.

29:00.072 --> 29:03.373
That was a terrible Batman.
That was the Batman.

29:05.343 --> 29:06.610
Mmm...

29:06.612 --> 29:08.112
Peace sign?

29:08.114 --> 29:10.714
Whoa, look at you,
one for two, huh?

29:14.686 --> 29:16.153
It's so sad.

29:17.155 --> 29:19.423
Are you still
thinking about that?

29:19.425 --> 29:22.126
He was married, had a family.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.027
Now he's all alone.

29:24.029 --> 29:26.263
Not if we can help it.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.299
Can we?
Yeah.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.801
Look what we just did.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.672
Go to sleep, all right?
Okay.

30:56.321 --> 30:57.487
Joan: Nick?

31:03.194 --> 31:04.261
Nick?

32:37.755 --> 32:40.157
Oh, my god! Nick, Nick!

32:40.159 --> 32:42.025
What's going on?
Something's grabbed my arm!

32:42.027 --> 32:43.794
What do you mean?
Something's grabbed my arm!

32:43.796 --> 32:45.028
Nick: What?

32:46.197 --> 32:47.431
Whoa!

32:49.867 --> 32:51.368
Is there... is there
somebody in there?

32:51.370 --> 32:52.903
I don't know.

32:53.871 --> 32:55.439
Get back, get back, get back.

33:19.765 --> 33:22.532
You gotta be kidding me.
What?

33:22.534 --> 33:24.935
It's the luggage.

33:24.937 --> 33:27.771
You just had a bad dream,
and you were sleepwalking.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.373
We both know that's
nothing new for you.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.708
This was real.
No, it wasn't.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.810
It seemed like
it was real, but it wasn't.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.178
You thought someone
was in there.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.847
That's because you did!

33:36.849 --> 33:38.382
Look, we just had an earthquake,

33:38.384 --> 33:40.784
all that stuff got tossed
around and it fell.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.019
That's it.

33:46.924 --> 33:48.525
Can I have some wine, please?

33:55.366 --> 33:57.234
How about a hug,
can I have a hug?

34:04.008 --> 34:06.443
Can I get a kiss?
No.

34:11.549 --> 34:15.752
Tim doesn't know we were working with Dr.
Piccault, now with you.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.587
Well, I don't think it's a
good idea to change that,

34:17.589 --> 34:21.824
especially since you made, what
sounds like, pretty good progress.

34:21.827 --> 34:26.063
I know you've consulted with
Dr. piccault in the past.

34:26.065 --> 34:29.900
So, do you think Tim's case
is more my area of expertise?

34:29.902 --> 34:33.770
I think your expertise is a
perspective that can only help.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.705
And what does
Dr. piccault think?

34:36.674 --> 34:39.842
He felt that Tim
was a unique case.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.847
You do know that
a vast majority of the cases

34:43.849 --> 34:46.283
have nothing to do
with the paranormal?

34:46.284 --> 34:49.553
I mean, have there been events
that point to the paranormal?

34:50.353 --> 34:51.621
Joan: No.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.989
Well, it's basic.

34:53.992 --> 34:56.827
You have Sage to burn, or osha?

35:26.924 --> 35:28.225
Elinore?

36:06.697 --> 36:07.764
Elinore!

37:00.886 --> 37:02.953
Dr. sephton: <i>Look, I know an
abrupt change in therapist</i>

37:02.955 --> 37:04.621
<i>can seem overwhelming.</i>

37:04.623 --> 37:07.624
<i>So let's just start slow,
and we'll build from there.</i>

37:10.361 --> 37:14.231
There's this feeling, rolling
around in the back of my head.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.334
I can't quite place it.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.402
And it never seems
to go away either.

37:20.871 --> 37:24.608
Kind of like dread, maybe.

37:24.610 --> 37:28.612
Existential dread is common
in cases like yours.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.748
I'm not so sure about
the existential part.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.484
So, you believe in destiny?

37:34.486 --> 37:36.419
I believe decisions
are mine to make.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.421
Like going outside?

37:38.423 --> 37:39.789
You decide it.

37:40.157 --> 37:42.225
Yes.

37:42.227 --> 37:43.927
What if you had been locked out?

37:44.762 --> 37:46.463
It didn't occur to me.

37:46.465 --> 37:47.897
Consciously.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.469
Anyway, still not
sleeping well at night?

37:52.471 --> 37:54.004
Bad dreams?

37:54.472 --> 37:55.605
Yes.

37:58.743 --> 38:01.177
Being evicted
is traumatic for anyone.

38:01.179 --> 38:05.015
For you, it's bound to wreak
havoc with your subconscious.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.716
Manifesting your dreams.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.956
And sometimes, I'm awake.

38:12.958 --> 38:16.259
I'm not at all puzzled that
you're having anxiety attacks.

38:17.928 --> 38:19.629
I...

38:19.631 --> 38:24.934
I feel like things are really
happening that I know can't be.

38:24.936 --> 38:30.940
Anxiety, and phobia, fear, stress, panic
are all rooted in the unconscious mind.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.543
And they can project
themselves in many ways,

38:33.545 --> 38:35.745
whether you are awake or asleep.

38:36.547 --> 38:38.948
So it's normal?

38:38.950 --> 38:42.485
Normal for you may not be
normal for someone else.

38:46.190 --> 38:48.458
But this is
a good starting point.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.405
Hey.

39:02.407 --> 39:05.308
Well, I figured the sooner we
started, the sooner we can finish.

39:08.212 --> 39:09.779
I'm not ready.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.053
You're gonna have to
come outside eventually.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.756
So I think we should just
peel the band-aid off, okay?

39:19.758 --> 39:21.791
Can you do me a favor?

39:21.793 --> 39:23.393
I want you to look
at me right here,

39:23.395 --> 39:25.762
that's the bull's-eye
right there, okay?

39:26.330 --> 39:28.798
Give me your hands.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.835
Come on, I'm not gonna bite
you, give me your hands.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.137
You can do it.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.174
That's it.
Okay, all right, okay.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.176
I just want you to put one
foot in front of the other,

39:40.178 --> 39:41.711
just take one step.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.647
Just like when you were a
kid, just give me one step.

39:44.649 --> 39:47.083
All right, now give
me another one.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.285
That's it.
Okay, come on.

39:49.287 --> 39:51.354
Watch the step here,
give me one more.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.522
Okay?

39:52.524 --> 39:54.057
Come on, that's it.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.392
One more.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.094
You can do it, one more.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.130
Look at the bull's-eye,
one more.

40:02.533 --> 40:03.933
You're outside.

40:04.435 --> 40:05.502
You did it.

40:29.293 --> 40:30.593
One...

41:24.014 --> 41:25.281
Hello?

41:25.283 --> 41:27.150
Distorted voice:
<i>Joan can't help you.</i>

41:27.751 --> 41:29.085
<i>Help you.</i>

41:29.087 --> 41:30.753
What about her?

41:30.755 --> 41:32.355
You leave her alone.

41:32.357 --> 41:34.224
Distorted voice: <i>She
doesn't know what I know.</i>

41:34.525 --> 41:35.658
What?

41:35.660 --> 41:37.994
<i>Hindsight hasn't
taught you anything.</i>

43:42.953 --> 43:44.020
Hey.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.627
What are you doing back there?

43:55.566 --> 43:57.133
I don't know that one.

43:59.803 --> 44:01.304
Ow, not so hard.

44:01.306 --> 44:02.405
Ow! Stop...

44:36.641 --> 44:37.707
Oh, come on.

44:39.276 --> 44:40.843
Oh, come on, come on.

45:04.135 --> 45:06.102
You got me.

45:06.104 --> 45:08.805
Well, how did you two
end up together?

45:08.807 --> 45:11.074
Well, she has pretty good taste,

45:11.076 --> 45:13.276
and I've got pretty good luck.

45:13.278 --> 45:15.111
Mmm.

45:15.113 --> 45:17.013
Yeah, she reminds me
of my wife, uh, carri.

45:17.648 --> 45:19.148
Oh, how'd you meet her?

45:19.150 --> 45:22.351
Uh, a styx concert, uh,
she passed me a joint.

45:22.353 --> 45:24.420
No way, stoned
at a styx concert?

45:24.422 --> 45:26.823
Any other way to see
styx in 1979?

45:26.825 --> 45:28.424
Well, I guess not.

45:29.259 --> 45:30.560
What happened to her?

45:35.833 --> 45:37.533
Oh! I'm... I'm sorry,
man, I didn't...

45:37.535 --> 45:40.670
Oh no, no it's okay, I've had more
than enough therapy, it's just...

45:40.672 --> 45:44.407
After, uh, my wife
was taken, um,

45:44.409 --> 45:45.641
my daughter, elinore...

45:46.577 --> 45:48.478
Hit her hard.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.246
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

45:52.650 --> 45:54.650
Yeah, after my wife,
well, elinore...

45:55.786 --> 45:57.120
Um...

45:59.289 --> 46:00.790
Well, she ran away.

46:00.792 --> 46:03.926
I don't blame her.
I wasn't exactly fit.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.028
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

46:06.897 --> 46:08.264
You're getting there.

46:15.239 --> 46:16.873
Didn't mean to be a buzz kill.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.207
No.

46:22.446 --> 46:23.780
Uh...

46:25.449 --> 46:26.783
Uh...

46:26.785 --> 46:28.117
I'm probably going to turn in.

46:28.952 --> 46:33.156
Oh, yeah, right, um...

46:36.126 --> 46:37.527
Do you mind if I crash?

46:38.729 --> 46:40.396
Sleep?

46:40.398 --> 46:41.831
Here?

46:41.833 --> 46:43.599
Yeah.

46:43.601 --> 46:48.204
Joan and I, we kind of got into it
earlier and I just need some space.

46:54.645 --> 46:55.812
Okay.

46:58.182 --> 46:59.482
Thanks, man.

47:03.887 --> 47:05.221
Goodnight.

48:10.287 --> 48:12.088
What are you doing?

48:12.090 --> 48:13.723
There's something in my room.

48:13.725 --> 48:15.191
What? Now?

48:44.187 --> 48:45.321
Tim!

48:45.956 --> 48:47.089
Tim!

48:49.293 --> 48:51.661
Tim? Tim.

48:53.964 --> 48:55.564
Tim, Tim.

48:55.566 --> 48:57.600
What the fuck are
you doing in here?

48:57.602 --> 48:59.101
Tim.

48:59.103 --> 49:00.202
Can you hear me?

49:00.204 --> 49:02.238
Tim, wake up, are you...

49:02.240 --> 49:03.773
What the...

49:03.775 --> 49:07.109
Tim, wake up, Tim, Tim...

49:12.650 --> 49:13.716
Jesus.

49:15.853 --> 49:17.520
Are you all right?

49:22.125 --> 49:23.426
And?

49:23.428 --> 49:24.827
Nothing.

49:24.829 --> 49:26.162
Nothing was there.

49:26.164 --> 49:29.432
Makes me feel stupid
just talking about it.

49:29.434 --> 49:32.368
Has he ever mentioned
seeing anything?

49:32.370 --> 49:34.170
What do you mean?
What kind of things?

49:34.172 --> 49:36.572
He's having severe
anxiety attacks, right?

49:36.574 --> 49:39.275
Which is why I like to
give him a sleep test.

49:39.277 --> 49:40.743
Something very simple.

49:40.745 --> 49:43.312
You know, just to be able
to rule things in or out.

49:43.314 --> 49:46.215
I would call someone and
have them come to him.

49:46.217 --> 49:48.384
You think you could get
him to go for that?

49:54.024 --> 49:56.058
Anna: This is the easiest
test you'll ever take.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.095
All you have to do, is sleep.

50:02.265 --> 50:05.735
What's this for?
Oh, really basic.

50:05.737 --> 50:08.137
It remotely monitors
heart-rate activity.

50:10.273 --> 50:12.541
That... that's all
you need to tell?

50:12.543 --> 50:14.276
Oh, no.

50:14.278 --> 50:17.947
This is just a simple way to see
if we need to do a full exam.

50:18.648 --> 50:19.949
Okay.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.885
Snoring a problem for you?

50:22.887 --> 50:24.820
Depends on who's doing it.

50:28.191 --> 50:31.994
You know, I don't mean to be
difficult, but I'm not tired.

50:32.596 --> 50:33.929
Me neither.

50:33.931 --> 50:35.031
How about we chat a bit?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.433
Tim: I have a song.

50:37.435 --> 50:38.601
Anna: Okay.

50:38.603 --> 50:40.369
Tim: It's from
when I was a kid.

51:04.594 --> 51:05.861
Joan: Anna!

51:11.635 --> 51:12.935
Nick: You see?

51:17.674 --> 51:18.874
I don't think he's breathing.

51:18.876 --> 51:21.010
See, this is what
I was telling you about.

51:32.924 --> 51:37.359
Nick: Luke, I am your father.

51:37.361 --> 51:38.561
Did you see that movie?

51:38.563 --> 51:40.029
Yeah. Yeah, do you
like science fiction?

51:40.031 --> 51:41.597
I do, yeah.

51:41.599 --> 51:42.898
I'm a big geek that way, let
me just see this for a second.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.300
Is that too tight?

51:44.302 --> 51:45.734
That's okay, it feels okay?

51:45.736 --> 51:47.536
So that's it, it's sleep apnea?

51:47.538 --> 51:51.373
Well, the c-pap should be
effective, but I'll be honest...

51:51.375 --> 51:53.843
This is definitely outside
of the realm of normal.

51:53.845 --> 51:55.945
Even for a sleep apnea.

51:55.947 --> 51:58.147
We need to run
a full examination on him.

52:00.784 --> 52:02.551
You're good at picking
up on things.

52:02.553 --> 52:03.752
What do you think it is?

52:04.621 --> 52:06.355
We know, through
scientific research

52:06.357 --> 52:10.426
that the cerebellum is the part
of the brain that reduces dreams.

52:10.428 --> 52:12.995
It's the very seat
of our unconscious mind.

52:12.997 --> 52:16.065
Phobias, repressed feelings,
darkened thoughts.

52:16.067 --> 52:19.902
The unconscious mind is a
powerful repository for them all.

52:19.904 --> 52:22.471
So is it that much
of a leap to theorize

52:22.473 --> 52:26.108
that paranormal phenomena would
manifest itself there first,

52:26.776 --> 52:27.943
when we sleep?

52:29.779 --> 52:30.946
Now you have quietly

52:32.382 --> 52:34.316
led us all down this path.

52:34.318 --> 52:36.418
Why don't you tell me
what's really going on?

56:33.289 --> 56:34.356
Mmm.

58:18.461 --> 58:19.528
Tim?

58:22.165 --> 58:24.032
How did you get here
by yourself?

58:24.634 --> 58:26.101
It's not that far.

58:27.003 --> 58:28.403
What are you doing?

58:29.172 --> 58:30.806
I wanted to say something.

58:32.509 --> 58:33.809
Are you awake?

58:34.544 --> 58:36.245
Does that change anything?

58:39.082 --> 58:40.382
I don't know.

58:42.385 --> 58:45.554
Have you ever done anything that at
the time seemed like a good thing

58:46.489 --> 58:48.524
at hindsight proved you wrong?

58:51.194 --> 58:52.628
Yes.

59:00.703 --> 59:02.104
Hindsight.

59:03.673 --> 59:05.274
Sorry, I liked you.

59:30.033 --> 59:31.993
Nick: <i> I guess I can take
him back in the morning.</i>

59:35.305 --> 59:36.772
Do you want to
talk about before?

59:39.208 --> 59:41.710
Look, you said that
things were evolving.

59:42.278 --> 59:44.379
Well, maybe they are.

59:44.381 --> 59:46.582
But I'm not letting you
do this by yourself.

59:46.584 --> 59:50.152
Whatever happens,
we're in this together.

59:50.154 --> 59:51.753
You have anything
to say about that?

59:54.425 --> 59:56.558
What if the sleep clinic
doesn't work out?

59:56.560 --> 59:58.260
Why wouldn't it work out?

59:58.262 --> 01:00:00.228
It's a simple question, Nick.

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.831
Why don't we deal with
that if we have to?

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.768
Look, it's been a long day.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.705
Why don't you get some sleep?

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.507
Aren't you coming?

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:15.310
No, I better keep an eye on him.

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:17.245
I'll be okay, you go ahead.

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.692
Anna: <i> He should be dead.</i>

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:33.495
Normal, then an erratic beat,

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:36.498
then here. This is
a massive fibrillation.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.367
And then...

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:40.435
He's... his heart just stops.

01:00:40.437 --> 01:00:41.603
Joan: You mean
a heart attack?

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:43.605
No, that's not what a
heart attack looks like.

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.241
Can sleep apnea cause it?

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:50.746
Apnea causes a lack of oxygen, which
can cause your heart to stop.

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:53.315
So, how come, if he has
apnea, he's not already dead?

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.484
It's rare. Most of the
time, people wake up

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:56.551
when they can't breathe.

01:00:56.553 --> 01:00:58.120
Then go back to sleep.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:00.656
Just like you wake up when you
have to go to the bathroom.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:02.958
People can drift in and
out of apnea all night

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.260
and never really
get a night's sleep.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:08.296
Well, how long can someone
live after their heart stops?

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:11.566
In this scenario,
three or four minutes.

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:13.368
But it was stopped for longer.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.671
If he wasn't dead, I don't
know how he could be alive.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:18.473
Especially with no brain
damage, no side effects.

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:19.875
Joan: How does that happen?

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:21.243
That's what we're gonna
find out tomorrow night.

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:23.645
Shall we?

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:25.914
So, you're both free, and Jonathan too?
Nick: Mmm-hmm.

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:28.950
Joan: Yep. Nick: So,
how does this work?

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:32.888
We sold him on coming here, but Tim's
been asking me a lot of questions.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:38.226
We wire him to more advanced
diagnostic programs

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:39.928
that monitor brain functioning.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.863
Eeg, emg,

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:44.800
and then the data's transferred
back to my office computer.

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:45.967
So he just sleeps here?

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:47.436
He just sleeps here.

01:01:47.438 --> 01:01:49.137
We can hear him through a
two-way intercom monitor,

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:52.507
so if he needs anything,
he just lets us know.

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:54.976
Look, I've done this more
times than I can count.

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:56.712
There's nothing
to be worried about.

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:00.148
Well, thanks, doc.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.216
Thank you.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.085
Thank you.
Thanks, see you soon.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.098
Joan: <i> Did you tell him?</i>

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.333
Nick: <i> Yeah, I did.</i>

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.837
Joan: <i>How long is he
gonna hide in there?</i>

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:03.038
<i>Maybe he'd like
to come down here</i>

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.507
<i>and explain what's going on.</i>

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:07.509
Nick: <i>You know, Joan,
this agro-attitude</i>

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:08.743
is not gonna help.

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.474
Do you know anything
about what happened to Anna?

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.959
Nick said she had an accident.

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.428
Joan: Besides that?

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.564
No, how could I?

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.334
So much for your test.

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:34.202
Pretty bad timing
for you, right?

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:37.038
Bad timing for Anna too.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.206
She comes in, tries to help

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.674
and something happens to her.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.644
What about your wife?

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.614
You don't remember anything?

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:50.285
I was asleep when it happened.

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.520
That's it?
That's your story,

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:54.122
sleeping while your wife dies?

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:55.757
Of a stroke, right?

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.792
Did she scream for help?

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.939
I don't know what
you want me to say.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:14.009
How about the truth,
for starters?

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:16.578
You must have heard
her scream something,

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.746
why can't you remember?

01:05:17.748 --> 01:05:18.813
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:20.749
We're all
on the same team, right?

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.589
I'm sorry.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:34.129
Hey, whoa, where are you going?

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:35.797
Wait, wait, where you...

01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:37.799
Where are you going?

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.571
She's just a little strung out.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:13.254
Dr. Andre: <i>This is Dr. Andre
piccault to patient Tim liston,</i>

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:15.023
<i>October 13th.</i>

01:08:15.025 --> 01:08:17.492
<i>I've gotten very close
to Tim in recent months</i>

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.426
<i>and I've had a breakthrough.</i>

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:22.330
<i>When Tim sleeps, he
experiences an apnea state.</i>

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:25.332
<i>Uh, something supernatural
manifests.</i>

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:28.136
<i>It's like
he becomes like a bridge,</i>

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:30.505
<i>uh, that allows him
to cross over.</i>

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.143
<i>Tim.</i>

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:37.578
<i>Tim, what are you doing?</i>

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:47.654
<i>There's something in here.</i>

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:50.524
<i>You can hear it,
listen, right now.</i>

01:08:51.926 --> 01:08:54.529
<i>Bad things always happen,
I'm sorry I lied to you.</i>

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:11.412
What happened
to Dr. piccault?

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:14.616
He's in a coma.

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:20.087
Why do you have this?

01:09:28.363 --> 01:09:32.100
You, and Dr. piccault,
and Dr. sephton.

01:09:32.102 --> 01:09:34.669
Just one big lab rat,
aren't I, buddy?

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.938
No, no, you're taking
this the wrong way.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.305
Does it even matter?

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:40.108
Do you see what's
happening right now?

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:43.845
Matters to me.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.180
Yes.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:48.349
In the beginning, it was work.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.984
We could have left at any point,

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:54.154
and we didn't because of you
and how we felt about you.

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:57.258
Tim: That supposed to make me feel better?
Yeah, it should.

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.661
I put myself out there for you.

01:09:59.663 --> 01:10:01.663
Now we're all in,
all three of us.

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.668
You're not afraid to
go outside, are you?

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.939
You're afraid of what happens
when someone comes in.

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:14.909
That's why you don't
have any family...

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:16.644
Or friends...

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:18.279
Or anyone.

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:19.614
You knew.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:24.552
No, I coped.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.721
Why?

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.389
Why didn't you say
something, or do something?

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:29.757
You could have stopped it.

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:34.062
Stop something I'm not aware of?

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:38.766
I've been through therapy,

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:40.235
drugged up,

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:43.137
institutionalized,

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.940
harassed by police.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.545
What else is there
besides being alone?

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:54.282
Okay.

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.318
What do we know?

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:01.823
There's this thing, this dread.

01:11:01.825 --> 01:11:04.525
And when you go to sleep,

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:08.129
this apnea happens and you
become a bridge for it.

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:12.200
I don't want to be
a bridge anymore.

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:15.670
Nick: So how do we
blow up the bridge?

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.506
Jonathan would know.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:26.447
So what do we do
in the meantime?

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.249
We just gotta
keep you breathing.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.586
I'm taking first watch.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.974
Nick...

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:28.710
Nick, Nick!
Nick: What?

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:30.511
What, what, what? Tim: She's
right in front of me, Nick!

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:32.647
Where? Who? She's right in front...
Do something!

01:12:32.649 --> 01:12:34.315
Where, where, where?
Anna, she's right there!

01:12:34.317 --> 01:12:36.250
I don't see her, where is she?
There, there, there!

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.952
There's nothing there,
there's nothing there, man,

01:12:37.954 --> 01:12:39.020
there's nothing there!

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:49.630
Tim: <i>Bad things always happen,
I'm sorry I lied to you.</i>

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:09.550
Mmm.

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.255
I...

01:13:14.257 --> 01:13:16.124
I don't know what to say.

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.859
How about you can help us?

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:22.397
Look, this...

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:25.233
You've got to understand
that there's no precedent

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:26.501
for this.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:29.737
Maybe a few days.
Days?

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.006
We're not gonna
make it a few more days.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:35.643
Yes, I need time to work
through this, process it...

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:37.578
How much time
do you think we have?

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.547
I have no idea.

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:43.017
I just don't want to end up
like what you just showed me.

01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:46.821
I won't let that happen to Nick.

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.956
Not because of you or me.

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:53.594
You should have thought about
that before you started this.

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.035
Hey.

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:02.537
What did Jonathan say?

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.407
Did you get any sleep?

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:08.843
No, not really.

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:10.878
What did he say?

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:17.885
You do look tired, are you okay?

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:19.620
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:24.659
Nick, I'm sorry.

01:14:24.661 --> 01:14:26.694
No, I'm sorry.

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.696
I should have listened
to you sooner.

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:32.166
I'll stay with Tim tonight.

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:33.334
No, that's on me.

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:35.136
Nick, I can do it, it's okay.

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:36.804
I don't want you
over there with him.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.739
All I have to do
is keep him awake.

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:41.342
No.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:43.644
It doesn't matter
if I'm here or there.

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:46.948
You said we'd take shifts.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:49.250
I'll start tonight and
when you get some sleep

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:50.485
you can come over.

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:54.555
All right.

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:56.791
I'll set my alarm for midnight.

01:14:56.793 --> 01:14:58.326
What did Jonathan say?

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.529
He said tomorrow
he'd have a plan.

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:04.432
Oh.

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:53.074
Oh, shoot.

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.059
Joan: <i>Hey, it's Joan.
Leave a message.</i>

01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:14.061
What?

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:40.287
Daddy, daddy, wake up!

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:41.889
Daddy!

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.778
Bad dream.

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:14.288
I have something for you.

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.367
Mmm.

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:33.541
Mr. scribbles.

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.578
You forgot him when you left.

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:42.850
You knew?

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:49.724
I never stopped
thinking about you.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:51.726
I never stopped
caring about you.

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:53.728
Elinore.

01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:58.666
Never really was an
eviction, was there?

01:19:00.135 --> 01:19:01.936
You needed a little push.

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.772
And Dr. piccault?

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:09.410
Getting him to take you on
was the real challenge.

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:15.549
I wanted to come back sooner,
I'm sorry it took me so long.

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:17.885
No.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.923
I'm so sorry I wasn't
there for you.

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.626
I don't blame you.

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:27.928
I hope you know that.

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:30.898
I do.

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:33.601
I'm glad.

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:39.507
I wish I could have been stronger...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:43.277
You're stronger now.

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.616
So beautiful.

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:53.154
Proud of you.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.069
Carri: <i> Help me!</i>

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:52.373
<i>Help!</i>

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.224
Where did this come from?

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:17.231
I found it at Tim's.

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:28.008
A lot of these seem like they're
Latin, like quorum, quota...

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:29.843
Now here's one, "quotidian".

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.346
Recurring daily.

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:35.082
Huh.

01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:36.951
I'm not keeping you up, am I?

01:22:36.953 --> 01:22:38.652
Mmm-mmm.
Okay.
