00:00.404 --> 00:01.872
<i>Previously on "heartland":</i>

00:01.939 --> 00:04.474
Lisa has offered to buy
the dude ranch,

00:04.541 --> 00:06.275
<i>And I accepted.</i>

00:06.343 --> 00:08.978
You can't possibly think
that waitressing at Maggie's

00:09.045 --> 00:10.679
<i>Even counts as a job.</i>

00:10.747 --> 00:12.581
You should get yourself
back to school.

00:12.648 --> 00:14.383
You have to admit,
we're really good together.

00:14.450 --> 00:16.352
Yes! Yes we are!

00:20.690 --> 00:22.123
Chase...

00:22.191 --> 00:23.424
I'm so sorry.

00:23.492 --> 00:25.026
It doesn't change anything,
I still love you.

00:25.094 --> 00:26.694
It doesn't change anything?

00:26.762 --> 00:28.662
(pained grunt)

00:28.730 --> 00:30.431
And that's for going after
my girlfriend.

00:33.468 --> 00:36.037
We're okay.
All right.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.439
(horses thunder across field)

00:43.477 --> 00:44.544
(horse whinnies)

00:48.883 --> 00:49.950
(spartan grunts)

00:57.425 --> 00:58.491
Ty:
What is it?

00:59.427 --> 01:00.827
Amy:
Spartan.

01:01.194 --> 01:03.195
I don't know, he just hasn't
been himself today.

01:03.263 --> 01:06.132
He seems distracted
or something.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.100
Well, he's not the only one.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.437
You've been a million miles away
all afternoon.

01:11.504 --> 01:13.439
What's on your mind?

01:13.506 --> 01:14.573
(sighs)

01:15.708 --> 01:17.108
(paper rustles)

01:20.814 --> 01:22.881
Ty:
Colorado state university?

01:27.252 --> 01:28.786
(reading) "dear Amy Fleming.

01:28.854 --> 01:30.321
We are pleased to inform you
that you have been accepted

01:30.388 --> 01:33.691
"To the equine science program
on a full scholarship."

01:35.193 --> 01:36.393
Amy, this is incredible.

01:36.462 --> 01:38.295
Yeah.

01:38.363 --> 01:40.565
I didn't even know you applied
to American universities.

01:40.632 --> 01:42.499
Well, Lou made me.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.968
I... I didn't think
I'd get in,

01:45.035 --> 01:47.938
Let alone a full scholarship.

01:49.574 --> 01:51.708
Amy, this is a good thing.

01:51.776 --> 01:52.943
I know it is.

01:53.010 --> 01:55.044
I know, I just...

01:55.112 --> 01:56.480
I never really thought
about going away

02:01.718 --> 02:03.519
You know that's in two days,
right?

02:03.587 --> 02:06.154
Thanks for reminding me.

02:07.791 --> 02:11.093
Look, the important thing
is you have options.

02:11.160 --> 02:15.964
Most people would kill
for a scholarship like this.

02:23.873 --> 02:24.939
(sighs deeply)

02:28.978 --> 02:30.644
<i>(approaching footsteps)</i>

02:31.579 --> 02:33.413
(knock at the door)

02:33.481 --> 02:34.548
Come in.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.351
Jack:
We need you
in the living room.

02:38.419 --> 02:39.520
Is something up?

02:39.587 --> 02:41.388
Jack:
Family meeting.

02:43.157 --> 02:45.392
Well, you're probably all
wondering what I'm doing here,

02:45.459 --> 02:46.792
So I'll get right to the point.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.260
Jack and I have been talking
for a while

02:48.328 --> 02:49.562
About the possibility

02:49.630 --> 02:51.931
Of my bringing another one
of my kids

02:51.999 --> 02:54.433
<i>Out here to the ranch
to work for the summer.</i>

02:54.501 --> 02:56.602
<i>Jack: But I don't want
to make any decisions</i>

02:56.670 --> 02:59.906
Unless everyone here's
in agreement.

03:00.841 --> 03:01.973
Well, if this is something
you want, grandpa,

03:02.041 --> 03:03.642
Then I'm totally for it.

03:03.709 --> 03:04.643
Me too.

03:04.710 --> 03:05.944
It's fine with me.

03:06.012 --> 03:07.646
Besides, the last one
turned out pretty good.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.216
<i>Jack:
I guess that settles it then.</i>

03:12.284 --> 03:14.619
So, I managed to score
an invite

03:14.687 --> 03:17.088
To Soraya's party
tomorrow night.

03:17.156 --> 03:20.791
And Jamie and Rachel
are both dying to come, but...

03:20.859 --> 03:22.526
I can only invite one guest.

03:22.594 --> 03:25.195
So?
Who're you gonna take?

03:25.263 --> 03:28.065
Well, I've given it
a lot of thought,

03:28.132 --> 03:29.600
And I pick you.

03:30.535 --> 03:31.602
Me?

03:31.670 --> 03:34.236
Unless, you have plans
with Chelsea.

03:34.304 --> 03:35.838
Chelsea? Um...

03:35.906 --> 03:38.474
We kinda broke up.

03:38.542 --> 03:40.610
I know, I heard.

03:40.678 --> 03:43.345
I mean, I'm sorry to hear that.

This is Jake.
He's... A friend.

04:46.172 --> 04:49.241
He's just giving me a hand
today.

<i>Badger: Yeah, well,

04:50.409 --> 04:51.376
I'm gonna be
your new ranch hand.

04:51.444 --> 04:53.245
So, uh, Roy can mosey on home
now.

04:53.312 --> 04:54.445
And how 'bout I mosey
on over there

04:54.513 --> 04:57.214
And introduce you to my fist.

Jack: Welcome to your new

05:04.422 --> 05:06.323
<i>Badger:
All right!</i>

05:06.391 --> 05:08.760
<i>Jack: We'll see if you're still
smiling tomorrow morning.</i>

05:08.827 --> 05:11.795
You're about to find out
what hard work really means.

05:11.863 --> 05:13.363
Yes, sir,
Mr. Bartlett.

05:13.430 --> 05:14.497
Come on.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.134
Let's get your stuff
out of the car.

05:17.201 --> 05:18.268
Later Roy.

05:20.071 --> 05:22.338
So, that's badger.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.507
Jack, how could you?

05:26.843 --> 05:28.443
What'd I do?

05:36.352 --> 05:38.120
Tim, are you joking?

05:39.089 --> 05:41.456
It's a fair price.

05:41.524 --> 05:43.124
Well, do you think
that's a fair price?

05:43.192 --> 05:44.425
I mean, I kind of thought

05:44.493 --> 05:46.194
We would arrive
at a price together.

05:46.261 --> 05:48.963
I don't want there to be
any bad blood here.

05:49.031 --> 05:51.432
There won't be, okay?
I promise.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.903
Let me just talk
to my business partner here.

05:54.970 --> 05:56.104
I'm just starting
to feel like maybe

05:56.172 --> 05:59.907
This isn't such a good idea
after all.

05:59.974 --> 06:01.041
Okay.

06:05.814 --> 06:08.515
Dad?!
What're you doing?

06:09.450 --> 06:11.518
Well, she thinks for a second
she's gonna steal this place

06:11.586 --> 06:12.619
'cause she's Jack's girlfriend,

06:12.687 --> 06:13.853
She's got another thing coming.

06:13.921 --> 06:15.822
Dad, we can't ask
for this kind of money.

06:15.889 --> 06:17.957
Lou!
She's not an idiot.

06:18.959 --> 06:21.794
I got her exactly
where I want her, okay?

06:21.862 --> 06:23.229
It's all part
of the negotiation.

06:23.296 --> 06:25.264
You just let me work the deal.

06:25.332 --> 06:27.066
Are you serious?

06:27.968 --> 06:29.335
Trust me.

06:30.970 --> 06:32.070
(exasperated sigh)

06:34.306 --> 06:35.774
(poster flitters)

06:36.709 --> 06:38.944
What're you doing
with my motorcycle poster?

06:39.011 --> 06:40.912
There's no room.

06:43.950 --> 06:46.483
Are you sure you wanna stay
in the barn?

06:46.551 --> 06:50.020
Well, Jack offered me
the guest room in the house,

06:50.088 --> 06:51.355
But, come on,

06:51.422 --> 06:52.623
It's not like I wanna be
staying down the hall

06:52.690 --> 06:54.691
From the old man.

06:56.361 --> 06:59.930
I think it'll be cool
to stay out here.

06:59.998 --> 07:02.698
(hum of chatter, girl laughing)

07:04.969 --> 07:07.036
Oh, Amy!
Over here.

07:10.174 --> 07:11.107
Hi.

07:11.175 --> 07:12.842
Hi.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.410
Well, I should get going.

07:14.478 --> 07:15.611
Congratulations again

07:15.679 --> 07:16.412
On the whole
valedictorian thing.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.713
Thanks.

07:17.781 --> 07:19.381
And, uh, don't worry
about your speech.

07:19.448 --> 07:20.816
If the audience gets bored,

07:20.884 --> 07:21.850
Just do what I always do
on the ring of fire.

07:21.918 --> 07:23.252
Tell a joke?

07:23.319 --> 07:25.154
Whip out a chainsaw.

07:25.221 --> 07:27.489
Shock and awe.
Gets 'em every time.

07:27.556 --> 07:28.490
<i>See you later.</i>

07:28.557 --> 07:30.159
<i>Soraya:
Bye.</i>

07:31.627 --> 07:33.395
(door opens and closes)

07:34.329 --> 07:35.629
What was that?

07:36.598 --> 07:37.965
Oh... I don't know.

07:38.033 --> 07:40.268
He's just been hanging out
a lot here lately,

07:40.335 --> 07:43.504
And we have these really
great conversations.

07:43.571 --> 07:44.939
But I don't think
it's anything.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.307
So anyways,
what was this big news

07:46.374 --> 07:48.776
You wanted to tell me about?

07:52.613 --> 07:55.315
Colorado state university.

07:56.550 --> 07:57.784
Oh my God!

07:57.852 --> 07:59.252
This is like the best equine
science program

07:59.320 --> 08:00.954
In north America.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.223
I am so proud of you,
I'm gonna cry.

08:03.291 --> 08:06.158
Don't, because I'm not sure
if I'm going yet.

08:06.226 --> 08:07.960
But this is a full ride
scholarship.

08:08.028 --> 08:09.128
I know,

08:09.196 --> 08:11.096
And I know I'm supposed
to be excited,

08:11.164 --> 08:13.065
But...

08:13.133 --> 08:14.499
It's just so not part
of the plan.

08:14.567 --> 08:15.868
You know, I...

08:15.936 --> 08:17.602
Not that I really had a plan,

08:17.670 --> 08:19.338
But I just...

08:20.373 --> 08:21.540
You're class valedictorian.

08:21.607 --> 08:23.107
Gimme some wisdom.

08:23.175 --> 08:25.076
Come on,
tell me what I should do.

08:25.144 --> 08:27.511
Well, this is your decision,
Amy.

08:27.579 --> 08:29.814
No one can make it for you.

08:29.882 --> 08:31.950
It's my decision, huh?

08:32.017 --> 08:33.985
That's all I got.

08:35.287 --> 08:36.821
It's my decision.

08:36.889 --> 08:38.322
Lou: If you turn down
that scholarship,

08:38.389 --> 08:39.890
You're going to regret it
for the rest of your life.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.892
Jack: Oh, Lou, isn't
that a bit dramatic?

08:41.960 --> 08:43.592
Lou:
No, I don't think so, grandpa.

08:43.660 --> 08:46.796
Going to university was
the best decision I ever made.

08:46.864 --> 08:48.698
Yeah, but I'm not you.
'Kay?

08:48.766 --> 08:50.834
And I have not ruled this out
completely, okay?

08:50.901 --> 08:52.469
I just...
I wanna think about it.

08:52.536 --> 08:53.936
But what is there
to think about?

08:54.004 --> 08:57.273
I mean, life is handing you
an incredible opportunity.

08:57.341 --> 08:58.508
<i>Grab on to it.</i>

08:58.576 --> 08:59.976
It's not that simple, Lou.

09:00.043 --> 09:01.378
It is that simple.

09:01.445 --> 09:02.411
But if you wanna sabotage
your whole life,

09:02.479 --> 09:03.746
Then go right ahead.

09:03.813 --> 09:04.880
Excuse me.

09:06.516 --> 09:08.717
I've got work to do.

09:10.953 --> 09:12.020
I'm gonna...

09:17.193 --> 09:18.626
<i>Tim:
So...</i>

09:19.628 --> 09:21.295
Lisa, have you had a chance
to go over those numbers

09:21.363 --> 09:23.631
For the dude ranch?

09:23.699 --> 09:24.965
Lisa:
Um...

09:25.033 --> 09:26.967
Don't think that's
appropriate conversation

09:27.035 --> 09:28.068
For the dinner table.

09:28.136 --> 09:29.370
Okay.
But just so you know,

09:29.438 --> 09:32.940
There's a lot of other
interested parties.

09:33.008 --> 09:34.341
Since when?

09:34.409 --> 09:35.742
Since I put an ad
in the Hudson times.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.577
You did what?

09:37.645 --> 09:38.812
Wait a minute...

09:38.880 --> 09:41.981
I want you to have it,
it's just...

09:42.049 --> 09:43.116
I can't give it away.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.418
Tim.

09:44.485 --> 09:45.819
Lou and I have made
an agreement!

09:45.887 --> 09:49.389
Jack: See, I knew
this was a bad idea.

09:49.457 --> 09:51.323
Excuse me,
I'm gonna catch a little air.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.825
It's just business.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.229
(door opens and closes)

09:57.297 --> 09:58.564
You know I'm blaming you.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.299
Oh, what else is new?

10:00.366 --> 10:01.700
You guys do the dishes.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.101
Jack...

10:03.169 --> 10:04.236
Dishes!

10:06.939 --> 10:09.407
<i>Tim:
Guess I should be moseying.</i>

10:09.475 --> 10:11.242
Hey. Nice to meet you,
beaver.

10:12.344 --> 10:13.645
Uh, badger.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.581
(door opens and closes)

10:21.687 --> 10:22.753
So...

10:24.322 --> 10:25.789
What's going on
with you and Roy?

10:25.857 --> 10:27.791
His name is Jake,

10:27.859 --> 10:30.527
And you don't get to ask me
that question.

10:30.595 --> 10:32.095
Why're you mad at me?

10:32.163 --> 10:34.030
That's another question
you're not allowed to ask me.

10:34.966 --> 10:36.533
Okay...

10:36.601 --> 10:37.868
What am I allowed to ask you?

10:37.936 --> 10:39.001
Nothing.

10:39.069 --> 10:42.204
From now on,
I'll ask the questions.

10:42.272 --> 10:44.206
Three months ago
you stopped calling me.

10:44.274 --> 10:45.407
Why?

10:46.443 --> 10:48.143
Look, it wasn't on purpose,
okay?

10:48.211 --> 10:51.146
I bet you have a really good
reason, don't you?

10:51.214 --> 10:52.949
Yeah, I do.

10:53.016 --> 10:55.283
Does it involve time travel

10:55.351 --> 10:57.218
Or being sucked
into a worm hole

10:57.286 --> 10:59.654
And ending up in
some distant universe

10:59.722 --> 11:01.556
<i>Where the only form
of communication</i>

11:01.624 --> 11:04.693
Is two tin cans and a string?

11:04.760 --> 11:07.161
That's awesome,
but... No.

11:08.097 --> 11:09.931
Then there's no reason

11:09.999 --> 11:11.966
Why you couldn't have told me
this good reason

11:12.033 --> 11:14.067
Three months ago.

11:14.135 --> 11:15.736
Now it's too late.

11:15.804 --> 11:16.737
Because of Jake?

11:16.805 --> 11:18.005
No!

11:18.072 --> 11:20.508
Because of you!
Because I kissed you,

11:20.575 --> 11:22.009
<i>And now I wish
more than anything</i>

11:22.076 --> 11:24.845
<i>That I could take it back.</i>

11:29.149 --> 11:30.249
Val:
Soraya.

11:30.684 --> 11:32.018
I hear you made valedictorian.

11:32.085 --> 11:33.419
Congratulations.

11:33.487 --> 11:35.121
Your mother must be
very proud, huh?

11:35.188 --> 11:36.455
Thank you, Mrs. Stanton,
she is.

11:36.524 --> 11:38.424
Um, you okay to close up?

11:38.492 --> 11:39.826
It's what I live for.

11:39.894 --> 11:40.927
Okay, bye.

11:40.995 --> 11:42.694
<i>Ashley:
Good night.</i>

11:43.630 --> 11:44.997
Wow, valedictorian.

11:45.064 --> 11:46.565
That's pretty impressive.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.600
Yeah, it's great.

11:49.903 --> 11:52.303
It can't be easy for you,

11:52.371 --> 11:54.172
Watching all your friends
moving on with their lives

11:54.240 --> 11:55.507
And you're stuck here,

11:55.575 --> 11:57.809
Emptying the fryer grease, huh?

11:57.877 --> 11:59.176
I've had a long day.

11:59.244 --> 12:01.378
Can we not do this, mom?

12:01.446 --> 12:02.513
Sorry.

12:04.215 --> 12:05.616
I don't know,
I just can't help but wonder

12:05.684 --> 12:07.785
Where do you see yourself
five years from now?

12:07.853 --> 12:08.986
Five years?

12:09.054 --> 12:10.487
I don't even know
what I'm gonna be doing

12:10.556 --> 12:11.689
In five days.

12:11.757 --> 12:12.990
And that's not a problem
for you?

12:13.058 --> 12:14.558
(sighs) no.

12:16.661 --> 12:18.762
You know, Ashley,

12:18.829 --> 12:20.463
If you're happy
living in a trailer

12:20.531 --> 12:21.965
And working at Maggie's,

12:22.033 --> 12:24.267
<i>Then just keep doing
what you've been doing.</i>

12:24.334 --> 12:25.702
But if you want more,

12:25.770 --> 12:27.037
You better think about
what needs to change.

12:27.104 --> 12:29.172
I don't want anything
to change.

12:29.239 --> 12:31.607
Caleb and I are happy.

12:31.675 --> 12:33.742
So I guess your plan
is to become a trailer trash

12:33.810 --> 12:35.143
Baby machine.

12:36.112 --> 12:39.014
Might need a bigger trailer.

12:44.253 --> 12:47.455
Well, I was wondering how long
it would take you to run away.

12:47.522 --> 12:49.591
This has gotta be
a new record for you.

12:49.658 --> 12:52.460
It's been, what?
Less than a day?

12:54.096 --> 12:56.698
What was your plan anyways?

12:56.765 --> 12:57.999
You figured you'd show up

12:58.067 --> 13:00.568
And Mallory would be happy
to see you?

13:00.636 --> 13:01.769
You don't know
the first thing about girls,

13:01.837 --> 13:03.269
Do you?

13:03.337 --> 13:04.337
You know what, can we skip
the man to man chat?

13:04.405 --> 13:06.439
I kind of have a bus to catch.

13:07.976 --> 13:12.145
I know how well running away's
worked for you in the past,

13:12.213 --> 13:14.114
You know, some guys in your
situation might stick around,

13:14.181 --> 13:17.383
Man up, and fight for the girl.

13:17.451 --> 13:19.151
It's your life though, man.

13:19.219 --> 13:21.220
Do what you want.

13:25.291 --> 13:28.227
If by some chance
you do decide to stay,

13:28.294 --> 13:33.032
Put my motorcycle poster
back up on the damn wall.

13:37.377 --> 13:38.444
<i>(rooster crows)</i>

13:40.946 --> 13:42.012
(hooves clop)

13:47.285 --> 13:48.619
Scott said he'd come by
this evening

13:48.687 --> 13:49.920
And to take a look at spartan
if you want.

13:49.988 --> 13:51.856
Uh, tell him not to bother.

13:51.923 --> 13:53.358
He seems like his old self
this morning.

13:53.425 --> 13:56.493
I think I was just overthinking
things yesterday.

13:56.561 --> 13:57.961
Okay.

13:58.028 --> 13:59.896
Well, I'm gonna go meet Scott
at the clinic.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.733
So I will you later tonight
for Soraya's party.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.033
(sighs) that's tonight.

14:04.101 --> 14:05.369
I totally forgot.

14:05.436 --> 14:06.837
Ty and Amy:
(half laugh)

14:06.904 --> 14:08.238
See ya.
See ya.

14:09.273 --> 14:11.074
(takes a deep breath)

14:15.645 --> 14:16.879
Okay, I'm here.

14:16.946 --> 14:18.814
What do we do first?

14:19.750 --> 14:21.149
Well, first things first,

14:21.217 --> 14:22.718
<i>You should probably
get some boots on.</i>

14:22.786 --> 14:26.054
I'm sure Ty's got some
in his loft you can wear.

14:26.122 --> 14:27.522
Uh...

14:27.590 --> 14:28.956
No, it's cool.

14:29.024 --> 14:29.991
Besides, how do I know
that guy doesn't have

14:30.058 --> 14:31.959
Foot fungus or something?

14:32.027 --> 14:33.227
It's totally contagious,
you know?

14:33.295 --> 14:35.697
(sighs) suit yourself.

14:40.335 --> 14:41.403
Badger.

14:43.138 --> 14:44.471
Right here.

14:45.407 --> 14:46.807
Smells fantastic.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.208
Amy: Yeah, well,
you'll get used to it.

14:48.276 --> 14:50.210
Pretty soon you and manure
will become one.

14:50.278 --> 14:51.879
It will be like
your signature scent.

14:51.946 --> 14:52.880
Wonderful.

14:52.947 --> 14:54.448
Come on, this way.

14:54.516 --> 14:56.016
Your next job is to fill
the water trough every morning,

14:56.083 --> 14:57.751
And make sure
it stays filled, okay?

14:57.819 --> 14:58.919
Especially on hot days

14:58.986 --> 15:00.286
When the horses
are drinking a lot.

15:00.353 --> 15:01.521
Badger!
Paying attention?

15:01.588 --> 15:02.855
Yeah, yeah.
Fill the water trough.

15:02.923 --> 15:04.457
So hard.
Okay.

15:04.525 --> 15:05.625
Well, I gotta run into town.
I'm late for the diner,

15:05.692 --> 15:06.926
But I'll be back
in a couple hours,

15:06.993 --> 15:09.261
So don't get into trouble.

15:09.329 --> 15:10.796
Yes, ma'am.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:19.973 --> 15:21.140
<i>Mallory:
Hands off the feed, badger.</i>

15:21.207 --> 15:22.874
I have a system.

15:22.942 --> 15:23.774
Just trying to help.

15:23.842 --> 15:26.311
I don't need your help.

15:28.447 --> 15:29.513
Look,

15:30.449 --> 15:32.016
Can we talk about last night?

15:32.084 --> 15:33.818
Can't talk.
Rockin' out.

15:33.885 --> 15:36.354
(music blasts
through headphone)

15:36.422 --> 15:40.023
<i>Ashley: Caleb, where do you
see yourself in five years?</i>

15:40.091 --> 15:41.224
<i>Caleb:
Seriously?</i>

15:41.292 --> 15:42.492
Yeah, seriously.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.893
I mean, married people
are supposed to talk

15:43.962 --> 15:45.329
About stuff like that.

15:45.396 --> 15:46.529
Well...

15:47.465 --> 15:49.766
I imagine in five years,
with any luck,

15:49.834 --> 15:52.402
I'll probably be inducted
into the pro-rodeo hall of fame.

15:52.470 --> 15:53.603
For sure we'll buy a house,

15:53.671 --> 15:56.339
And, uh, maybe a little
herd of cattle.

15:56.406 --> 15:59.208
And where do I fit into
all of that?

15:59.276 --> 16:00.776
Well, I'd imagine
in the next five years,

16:00.844 --> 16:04.246
You probably wanna
get started on babies.

16:04.314 --> 16:05.381
Babies?

16:05.449 --> 16:07.850
Yeah. At least like,
three or four.

16:07.917 --> 16:09.251
Why not make it eight?

16:09.319 --> 16:10.853
We could have
our own reality show.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.187
Yeah, the way I see it,

16:12.254 --> 16:13.288
A kid should have lots
of brothers and sisters

16:13.356 --> 16:14.722
To play with.

16:14.790 --> 16:17.725
So what does that make me,
a baby machine?

16:17.793 --> 16:20.996
No, it makes you my wife
and a great mother.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.966
'Kay, I gotta go, babe.
I'll see you tonight.

16:25.034 --> 16:26.501
(door thuds shut)

16:38.380 --> 16:39.980
Lou: I'm starting to think
you don't really wanna sell.

16:40.048 --> 16:41.315
Tim:
Oh, I wanna sell.

16:41.383 --> 16:43.516
Lou:
Well, it's okay
if you don't.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.651
Tim: I just want you get the
best price possible, that's all,

16:45.719 --> 16:46.986
So you have a nest egg.

16:47.054 --> 16:48.854
Lou: A nest egg?
Tim: Yeah, a nest egg.

16:48.922 --> 16:50.823
Tim: In case things don't
work out with your oil guy.

16:50.891 --> 16:51.891
PW.

16:51.958 --> 16:53.026
What?

16:53.093 --> 16:55.294
Where is this coming from?

16:55.362 --> 16:57.963
Lou, you're here, he's there.

16:58.899 --> 17:00.465
Come on, you don't have
to be Anne landers

17:00.533 --> 17:02.867
To figure out the rest.

17:02.935 --> 17:04.269
Dad, you know what?

17:04.337 --> 17:06.003
Honestly?
Peter and I are great, okay?

17:06.071 --> 17:07.638
We're better than great.

17:07.705 --> 17:09.074
We're spectacular.

17:09.142 --> 17:10.775
And right now the best thing
for my marriage

17:10.843 --> 17:12.377
Is gonna be selling
this dude ranch.

17:12.444 --> 17:15.779
So, I need you to stop
worrying about nest eggs

17:15.847 --> 17:17.048
And just offer Lisa

17:17.115 --> 17:19.650
The price we came up with
together.

17:19.717 --> 17:21.252
Is that clear?

17:21.319 --> 17:22.752
Crystal.

17:23.488 --> 17:25.789
Soraya: "so I say to this
year's graduating class,

17:25.857 --> 17:30.528
We must embrace the future
because the future is ours!"

17:30.595 --> 17:32.362
What do you think?

17:32.430 --> 17:33.696
It's good.

17:33.764 --> 17:35.265
I knew it, the speech sucks

17:35.332 --> 17:37.067
And I'm gonna put
the entire graduating class

17:37.134 --> 17:38.868
Into a coma.
No you're not.

17:38.936 --> 17:41.171
You're gonna be great.
Everyone loves you.

17:41.238 --> 17:42.872
Okay, where do you want
this punch bowl?

17:42.940 --> 17:44.840
Uh...
Just over there's good.

17:44.908 --> 17:46.276
Okay.

17:46.343 --> 17:47.909
Hey, uh, I've gotta talk to you
about something,

17:47.977 --> 17:49.211
But can you promise not to like

17:49.279 --> 17:51.346
Make a big deal out of it.
Okay.

17:51.414 --> 17:55.451
Um, I invited Chase
to the party tonight.

17:55.518 --> 17:56.952
You did?

17:57.019 --> 17:59.788
As my date, and he said yes.

18:00.723 --> 18:01.990
Did he.

18:02.058 --> 18:03.524
Look, I know you guys
don't really get along,

18:03.592 --> 18:04.559
And I get it.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.827
He can be a total...
Jerk.

18:06.895 --> 18:08.629
Yeah. But there's a lot more
to Chase powers

18:08.697 --> 18:10.664
Than the guy on
the ring of fire poster.

18:10.732 --> 18:11.899
You know, he's got this...

18:11.967 --> 18:13.201
Whole other side to him,

18:13.268 --> 18:16.237
And he's vulnerable
and sweet and...

18:16.305 --> 18:18.139
Did you know he's studying
sociology part time

18:18.207 --> 18:20.807
At the university of Calgary?

18:20.874 --> 18:21.808
No, I didn't.

18:21.875 --> 18:22.909
Yeah.

18:22.977 --> 18:26.146
And let's face it,
he's super hot.

18:27.115 --> 18:28.181
Badger:
(grunts)

18:30.918 --> 18:33.253
Jack:
And when you're done out here,

18:33.321 --> 18:35.254
You can start on the pens.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.723
<i>Badger: You know, I've been
cleaning up sh... Manure</i>

18:37.790 --> 18:39.225
Since six this morning.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.859
<i>Don't you think there's
something else I should,</i>

18:40.927 --> 18:42.894
Or could be doing?

18:42.962 --> 18:46.232
90 percent of your job
is shovelling manure.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.601
The other thirty percent
is hauling it, so...

18:48.668 --> 18:49.868
Do the math.

18:49.936 --> 18:51.003
Huh?

18:54.607 --> 18:56.174
(chuckles, amused)

19:09.521 --> 19:11.388
You know, I figure...

19:11.456 --> 19:14.958
I've been cleaning up after you
and your friends all day,

19:15.026 --> 19:17.261
I think you owe me a ride.

19:18.729 --> 19:20.297
Hold steady!

19:20.365 --> 19:21.731
(horse whinnies)

19:21.799 --> 19:23.832
Badger:
(screams and grunts)

19:23.900 --> 19:25.734
Jake and Mallory:
(gasp and laugh)

19:25.802 --> 19:26.869
(grunts)

19:29.072 --> 19:30.105
(laughing)

19:30.174 --> 19:33.008
Jake:
Wow! Nice dismount!

19:33.076 --> 19:34.710
<i>Good thing that manure
broke your fall.</i>

19:34.778 --> 19:37.012
Mallory and Jake:
(laugh)

19:37.080 --> 19:38.648
(breathing heavily)

19:40.416 --> 19:41.483
Both:
(laugh)

19:43.319 --> 19:47.021
Okay. So, all we need
is Lou's signature on here

19:47.956 --> 19:51.560
And the dude ranch
is officially Lisa's...

19:51.627 --> 19:54.862
For a very reasonable price,
I might add.

19:54.930 --> 19:58.131
Lisa: I'm just glad
it all worked out.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.734
I... I can't.

20:01.670 --> 20:03.003
Tim:
Yeah, right here...

20:03.071 --> 20:05.172
No, dad,
I don't think I wanna sell.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.273
Excuse me?

20:06.341 --> 20:07.474
Here we go.

20:07.542 --> 20:08.742
You just said
this is what you wanted.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.511
I know. But now,
I'm not so sure anymore.

20:10.579 --> 20:11.511
You're kidding me, right?

20:11.579 --> 20:12.945
Dad!

20:13.013 --> 20:14.347
Well, you picked a hell of time
to change your mind.

20:14.415 --> 20:16.749
Look, maybe we can still
run the place together.

20:16.817 --> 20:18.518
I know I live in Dubai, but...

20:18.586 --> 20:20.320
Maybe that's why
they invented the Internet.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.454
Look, I can't, okay?

20:21.522 --> 20:22.955
I have my money invested
elsewhere.

20:23.023 --> 20:25.157
I can't think about the dude
ranch anymore. You what?!

20:25.226 --> 20:27.526
You- we haven't even signed
the paperwork

20:27.594 --> 20:29.027
And you're already moving on?

20:29.095 --> 20:30.329
Did you think
I'm a mind reader.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.264
All right, let's everyone
just calm down.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.234
Lisa: Lou, honestly, I just
thought I was doing you a favour,

20:35.301 --> 20:36.768
But if you're still
interested in...

20:36.836 --> 20:38.203
No. You know what?

20:38.271 --> 20:39.271
I can't afford to run
this place on my own.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.639
Right.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.006
And since I no longer
wanna inconvenience

20:42.074 --> 20:46.377
My business partner
who's already moved on...

20:46.445 --> 20:48.679
Congratulations, Lisa,

20:48.747 --> 20:52.483
You bought yourself
a dude ranch.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.986
(music plays,
low hum of chatter)

20:59.590 --> 21:01.023
What's that?

21:01.091 --> 21:03.293
It's a pamphlet from
a university-college

21:03.361 --> 21:04.294
On the West coast.

21:04.362 --> 21:05.595
Mom...

21:05.663 --> 21:06.996
Before you get
all bent out of shape,

21:07.064 --> 21:09.666
Can I just tell you
one thing about it?

21:09.734 --> 21:11.601
You could finish all your
High School courses there,

21:11.669 --> 21:13.836
Then transfer directly
into the university program

21:13.904 --> 21:15.471
Without wasting an entire year.

21:15.538 --> 21:18.974
I'm not- Ashley, I just want
you to give it some thought.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.041
No pressure.

21:20.109 --> 21:21.677
I want you to know
your options.

21:21.745 --> 21:23.646
That's all. Like I'd be
able to afford that anyway.

21:23.713 --> 21:25.013
Well...

21:25.081 --> 21:27.616
Obviously,
I'd pay for everything.

21:27.684 --> 21:30.152
And, you know,
if you're worried about Caleb,

21:30.219 --> 21:32.153
If he really loves you?

21:32.220 --> 21:35.823
Well, he's gonna support
your decision, isn't he?

21:35.891 --> 21:38.159
You're such a smart girl,
Ashley,

21:38.226 --> 21:40.227
And you're still so young.

21:40.296 --> 21:42.764
Do not waste this time.

21:44.667 --> 21:47.134
(country music plays in diner)

21:57.978 --> 22:00.547
I wanna punch that guy so bad.

22:01.949 --> 22:06.819
When I said fight for her,
I didn't mean it literally.

22:06.886 --> 22:08.621
What would you do
if some Roy Rogers wannabe

22:08.689 --> 22:10.389
Was making a move on your girl?

22:10.457 --> 22:11.791
She's not your girl.

22:11.858 --> 22:13.826
What, you've never been
in a fight over a woman?

22:13.893 --> 22:14.860
No.

22:14.928 --> 22:16.595
<i>Badger:
Pfft! Liar.</i>

22:17.531 --> 22:19.097
<i>Amy:
Ready to go?</i>

22:19.165 --> 22:20.832
Ty:
Hey, you look beautiful.

22:20.899 --> 22:22.166
Thank you.

22:22.234 --> 22:23.635
Agh! Get a room.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.571
This is my room.

22:27.673 --> 22:28.807
See ya later, badger.

22:28.874 --> 22:29.574
Don't forget to water
the horses

22:29.642 --> 22:30.842
Before you go to bed.

22:30.909 --> 22:32.377
Yup. All over it.

22:33.446 --> 22:34.546
Go. Have fun.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.114
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

22:39.050 --> 22:41.418
<i>Jake: Yeah, so I'm thinking of
getting my drivers permit.</i>

22:41.486 --> 22:43.454
Oh yeah?
That's pretty awesome.

22:43.521 --> 22:44.988
<i>Jake: I'll probably get my dad's
old truck when I'm sixteen.</i>

22:53.497 --> 22:54.997
Hey, Lou.

22:55.065 --> 22:56.932
Hey.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.468
I was just stopping by

22:58.535 --> 23:00.302
To drop something off for Ty.

23:01.238 --> 23:02.972
You all right?

23:03.039 --> 23:04.841
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.711
I sold the dude ranch
to Lisa...

23:10.646 --> 23:12.547
And it's a good thing.

23:13.783 --> 23:16.685
It's a really,
really good thing.

23:17.620 --> 23:18.787
Congratulations.

23:18.855 --> 23:19.921
It's just that I worked so hard

23:19.989 --> 23:22.557
To make the it a success,
and...

23:22.625 --> 23:24.191
And now it's gone.

23:25.494 --> 23:27.160
But that's okay...

23:27.228 --> 23:29.430
Because I live in Dubai now.

23:29.498 --> 23:31.899
I am a desert girl,

23:31.966 --> 23:33.033
And I love it.

23:33.101 --> 23:34.735
I love camels

23:34.803 --> 23:36.904
And I love sand, and I...

23:37.839 --> 23:39.406
Love dung beetles.

23:41.341 --> 23:42.308
And who needs mountains

23:42.376 --> 23:43.443
When I have an indoor ski hill

23:43.511 --> 23:45.211
Right downtown?
It's...

23:45.279 --> 23:47.980
(tearing up)
it's super, super awesome.

23:48.916 --> 23:52.652
Why are these windows
so damn smudgy!

23:52.720 --> 23:54.120
Okay, Lou.

23:56.523 --> 23:58.256
Listen...

23:58.324 --> 23:59.291
(exhales heavily)

23:59.358 --> 24:02.060
You're not a desert girl.

24:02.128 --> 24:04.195
You're an Alberta girl.

24:04.263 --> 24:05.964
Always will be.

24:06.032 --> 24:08.133
So...

24:08.200 --> 24:11.269
Never stop kicking butt, okay?

24:13.472 --> 24:14.539
Thank you.

24:16.408 --> 24:19.977
You always know
what I need to hear.

24:22.314 --> 24:23.380
(sniffles)

24:24.583 --> 24:26.818
So, uh...
Dung beetles, huh?

24:26.885 --> 24:27.951
(laughs)

I know, I just don't understand

24:47.537 --> 24:50.072

24:50.139 --> 24:52.007
Yeah, but that's not

24:59.982 --> 25:01.683

25:31.678 --> 25:33.479
I, uh, figured since
you're graduating tomorrow,

25:33.547 --> 25:36.382
You might wanna see
what's in your future.

25:36.449 --> 25:37.517
Okay.

(laughs)

25:56.635 --> 25:57.701
(song continues)

26:02.741 --> 26:03.440
I gotta go tell her.

26:03.508 --> 26:05.242
Amy, don't, okay?

26:05.309 --> 26:07.778
She's gotta know the truth
about Chase.

26:09.714 --> 26:10.881
Um, soraya?

26:11.815 --> 26:12.882
Amy!

26:14.251 --> 26:16.318
Can I talk to you?

26:17.287 --> 26:18.320
Why don't I go get us
some drinks.

26:18.388 --> 26:19.455
Yeah.

26:20.558 --> 26:21.558
Hey.

26:21.625 --> 26:23.325
Hey, uh...

26:23.393 --> 26:25.294
There's just something
that I need to tell you.

26:25.362 --> 26:27.963
Okay, um, I actually had
to talk to you too.

26:28.031 --> 26:28.964
You first.

26:29.032 --> 26:30.231
Okay, um...

26:30.299 --> 26:33.035
I just wanted to say thanks,

26:33.102 --> 26:34.736
And you're my best friend

26:34.804 --> 26:36.204
And I would not have gotten
through High School

26:36.272 --> 26:38.006
Without you.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.908
And um...

26:39.976 --> 26:41.076
After your mom died,

26:41.143 --> 26:43.045
Just seeing the way
you kept going

26:43.112 --> 26:47.782
And got things accomplished,
it really inspired me.

26:47.849 --> 26:49.416
I mean, tonight could not
have been more perfect

26:49.484 --> 26:50.718
Because you're here

26:50.786 --> 26:52.219
And tomorrow
we're graduating together.

26:54.122 --> 26:55.389
Anyways, I'm getting all sappy,

26:55.457 --> 26:57.692
So what was it you wanted
to tell me?

26:57.759 --> 27:00.827
You know, it's not important.

27:00.895 --> 27:01.962
Come here.

27:06.133 --> 27:09.368
(drunkenly) you know what I
wanna be when I grow up?

27:09.436 --> 27:10.503
A surgeon.

27:11.772 --> 27:14.007
Or maybe a marine biologist.

27:14.942 --> 27:16.108
No, wait.

27:16.175 --> 27:17.977
Oprah!
(laughs)

27:19.145 --> 27:20.679
Hon, you're a little drunk.

27:20.747 --> 27:21.847
<i>Maybe it's time to go home.</i>

27:21.915 --> 27:23.983
I'm smart, Caleb.

27:24.050 --> 27:26.284
I could be a sturgeon.

27:27.220 --> 27:29.454
You wanna be a fish?

27:35.728 --> 27:37.729
Ashley, what the hell
are you doing?

27:37.796 --> 27:41.165
My future's in the garbage
and I have to find it.

27:41.233 --> 27:42.967
<i>Caleb:
Okay, that's enough.</i>

27:43.368 --> 27:45.536
Ashley: No! What are you doing?!
My future's in the garbage!

27:45.604 --> 27:47.538
Caleb:
Don't ask.

27:47.606 --> 27:49.172
<i>Ashley:
Caleb!</i>

27:49.240 --> 27:51.307
I think it's officially
a party!

27:51.375 --> 27:53.043
(everyone whoops and cheers)

27:56.237 --> 27:58.938
<i>Jack:
Badger? You in here?</i>

28:00.474 --> 28:02.208
Where is that kid?

28:03.143 --> 28:06.545
(horse nickers, heavy thump)

28:11.717 --> 28:12.751
Oh boy...

28:18.657 --> 28:19.358
(spartan breathes heavily
and grunts)

28:19.425 --> 28:20.492
Spartan?

28:22.262 --> 28:23.661
(spartan grunts deeply)

28:26.198 --> 28:27.265
Get up.

28:34.439 --> 28:38.442
(music plays loudly,
buzz of excited chatter)

28:42.513 --> 28:43.914
Hey.

28:43.981 --> 28:45.481
What are you doing here?

28:45.549 --> 28:47.250
I was bored, I hitched a ride.

28:47.318 --> 28:48.351
What do you say,

28:48.419 --> 28:49.286
Do you wanna hit
the dance floor?

28:49.353 --> 28:50.686
You've got two choices:

28:50.754 --> 28:52.889
Leave or I make you leave.

28:52.957 --> 28:55.258
You know, I was never good
at multiple choice.

28:55.326 --> 28:57.326
I pick "c," none of the above.

28:57.394 --> 28:58.494
You're a smartass.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.862
Yeah, and you're just an ass.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.697
Jake, don't!

29:01.765 --> 29:02.799
Guys!

29:02.866 --> 29:03.833
(fighting grunts,
partygoers yelp)

29:03.901 --> 29:04.934
Mallory:
Stop it, you two!

29:05.001 --> 29:05.935
(struggling grunts)

29:06.002 --> 29:08.003
<i>Mallory:
Enough!</i>

29:08.071 --> 29:09.605
Oh my God.

29:09.673 --> 29:10.640
<i>Chase: Come on, you
guys, break it up.</i>

29:10.707 --> 29:12.174
Ty:
Get off of him!

29:12.242 --> 29:14.309
Relax, buddy.
Relax!

29:15.277 --> 29:16.511
You don't listen, do you?

29:16.579 --> 29:19.681
Mallory: You're
pathetic, both of you!

29:20.616 --> 29:21.716
Ty, we gotta go home.

29:21.784 --> 29:22.551
There's something wrong
with spartan.

29:22.618 --> 29:23.585
Come on, let's go.

29:23.653 --> 29:24.653
Badger:
Get off me!

29:25.955 --> 29:27.622
Chase:
On your feet, pal.

29:27.690 --> 29:29.056
You're all right.

29:30.425 --> 29:31.826
(spartan grunts)

29:44.205 --> 29:45.304
You're all right.

29:46.674 --> 29:49.442
Spartan colicked.
It's bad.

29:49.510 --> 29:51.911
I wanna operate,
but I can't get him up.

29:51.979 --> 29:54.714
<i>Jack: We tried everything
short of a cattle prod.</i>

29:56.283 --> 29:57.917
<i>Amy:
No, we've gotta get him up!</i>

29:57.985 --> 30:00.353
You gotta operate on him!

30:00.420 --> 30:03.221
Amy, you gotta know,
colic surgery,

30:03.289 --> 30:04.590
It isn't cheap.

30:06.125 --> 30:07.926
Lou, please...?

30:07.994 --> 30:09.060
I think we're insured.

30:09.128 --> 30:10.596
Just let me worry about that,
okay?

30:11.731 --> 30:13.765
Okay, then,
well, let's get him up.

30:13.833 --> 30:14.766
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

30:14.834 --> 30:15.901
Amy:
It's okay, buddy.

30:15.969 --> 30:17.635
Come on, boy.

30:17.703 --> 30:19.837
<i>Ty: What happened?
He was fine this morning.</i>

30:19.905 --> 30:21.572
It's hard to say for sure,

30:21.640 --> 30:23.273
<i>But he is dehydrated.</i>

30:23.341 --> 30:25.342
There's no water in his trough.

30:25.410 --> 30:27.211
<i>Ty:
Spartan's on dry feed.</i>

30:27.278 --> 30:28.245
If he didn't get enough water,

30:28.313 --> 30:29.680
That would explain the colic.

30:33.684 --> 30:35.785
Can I have everyone out,
please?

30:35.853 --> 30:36.987
<i>I want to be alone.</i>

30:40.925 --> 30:42.926
It's okay, buddy.

30:57.007 --> 30:59.008
You're all right, okay?

31:04.514 --> 31:06.480
(spartan breathes heavily)

31:07.416 --> 31:08.750
It's okay, spartan.

31:09.652 --> 31:12.053
I'm here now, buddy.
Okay?

31:12.120 --> 31:15.122
Come on,
you gotta come back to me.

31:16.691 --> 31:17.724
Please...

31:20.895 --> 31:22.963
(spartan grunts heavily)

31:24.866 --> 31:25.933
Please...

31:31.905 --> 31:34.006
(wind gusts, Gate creaks)

31:34.608 --> 31:37.377
(Gate clunks,
wind gusts stronger)

31:38.312 --> 31:40.646
(lights squeak as they swing)

31:47.954 --> 31:49.254
It's okay, boy.

31:51.691 --> 31:53.192
Gotta get up now, okay?

31:53.259 --> 31:54.793
(grunts)

31:54.860 --> 31:56.628
You gotta get up for me.

31:56.696 --> 31:58.397
Okay? You can do it.

31:59.364 --> 32:00.731
Come on, boy.

32:00.799 --> 32:01.899
You can do it.

32:01.967 --> 32:03.968
Come on.
Good boy.

32:04.035 --> 32:06.003
Come on, keep going.

32:06.071 --> 32:07.638
Good boy.
Come on.

32:16.080 --> 32:17.981
Good boy.
Yes you are.

32:21.752 --> 32:24.053
Her so long?

32:24.122 --> 32:26.456
Maybe we're too late.

32:29.927 --> 32:30.994
(hooves clop)

32:36.633 --> 32:38.066
(sigh of relief)
I knew you'd do it.

32:38.135 --> 32:41.837
<i>Jack: Let's get him
in the trailer.</i>

32:41.904 --> 32:43.172
You all right?

32:43.240 --> 32:44.406
Yeah.

32:44.474 --> 32:45.674
Come on,
we'll follow in my truck.

32:48.677 --> 32:51.045
(door squeaks)

32:54.583 --> 32:55.683
Scott:
We'll take it from here.

32:55.751 --> 32:58.085
Amy:
No, I'm coming with you.

32:58.154 --> 32:59.387
Um, it's okay.

32:59.455 --> 33:00.655
We'll take real good care
of him,

33:00.722 --> 33:01.789
I promise.

33:03.424 --> 33:04.658
Okay.

33:05.693 --> 33:09.062
(spartan breathes heavily,
hooves clop)

33:24.311 --> 33:25.344
What happened?

33:27.181 --> 33:29.014
Spartan colicked.

33:29.983 --> 33:31.116
I don't even know
what that means.

33:31.185 --> 33:34.253
Colic is serious.
Horses can die from it.

33:34.321 --> 33:36.854
(mordant chuckle)
I've been here one day

33:36.922 --> 33:39.057
And I've already managed
to kill one of the horses.

33:39.124 --> 33:42.194
Is this just some big joke
to you?

33:42.261 --> 33:45.029
Oh yeah, it's hilarious.

33:49.968 --> 33:52.869
Do you wanna hear a joke?

33:52.937 --> 33:54.238
Stop me if you've already heard

33:54.306 --> 33:57.274
The one about the kid
who tracks down his parents

33:57.342 --> 34:00.711
And how they have
this new house,

34:00.778 --> 34:02.546
With two bedrooms.

34:03.515 --> 34:06.483
You know, one for them and...

34:07.685 --> 34:10.119
One for the new baby.

34:10.187 --> 34:13.054
<i>Oh, don't worry,
it's gets better.</i>

34:13.123 --> 34:16.326
You see his parents,
they, uh...

34:16.393 --> 34:21.231
They act like they're
really happy to see him,

34:21.297 --> 34:23.431
But he gets the hint.

34:23.498 --> 34:26.301
You know,
he doesn't hang around long.

34:26.369 --> 34:29.103
Badger... Looks like he won't be
staying here much longer either

34:29.170 --> 34:33.641
'cause he didn't fill
the damn trough, so...

34:33.710 --> 34:34.943
Yeah,

34:35.010 --> 34:37.679
Maybe this is all a joke.

34:43.885 --> 34:45.753
Did you hear anything?

34:45.820 --> 34:46.987
I just talked to Lou.

34:47.054 --> 34:48.322
She's checking to see
if your insurance

34:48.389 --> 34:50.458
Covers spartan's surgery.

34:50.525 --> 34:52.760
Okay, that's good.

34:56.797 --> 35:00.267
I can't believe badger
didn't water the horses.

35:00.334 --> 35:03.102
Ty, it's not just his fault.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.904
Hey, there were signs.

35:04.972 --> 35:07.073
I think it started yesterday.

35:07.141 --> 35:08.408
Yeah, but not having water
for a day

35:08.476 --> 35:09.609
Probably made it worse.

35:09.677 --> 35:11.343
Yeah, well,
I shoulda been on it.

35:11.411 --> 35:12.878
I screwed up.
I just...

35:12.945 --> 35:14.613
I've been so busy
worrying about grad

35:14.681 --> 35:15.914
And about this scholarship,

35:15.982 --> 35:16.915
That I didn't see
what was happening

35:16.983 --> 35:18.016
Right in front of me.

35:18.084 --> 35:20.486
(footsteps thud, Amy sighs)

35:21.554 --> 35:22.688
Good news.

35:22.756 --> 35:24.723
Everything went really well.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.191
Can I see him?

35:27.093 --> 35:28.192
Thanks.

35:36.168 --> 35:37.234
(nickers)

35:38.170 --> 35:39.537
Hey, boy.

35:39.605 --> 35:40.672
(nickers)

35:41.674 --> 35:42.907
It's okay.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.574
We'll keep him here
for the next few days,

35:44.642 --> 35:46.476
Make sure there's no infection.

35:46.544 --> 35:48.945
But I think he's gonna be fine.

35:49.013 --> 35:50.347
Can I stay here with him?

35:51.282 --> 35:53.517
As long as you want.

35:58.255 --> 35:59.289
Hey.

36:15.018 --> 36:16.285
So?
How's spartan doing?

36:16.353 --> 36:17.686
Is he gonna be okay?

36:17.754 --> 36:19.988
Yeah, Scott thinks so.

36:20.056 --> 36:21.890
And Phil over
at Western financial

36:21.958 --> 36:24.426
Says they're gonna cover
the cost of the surgery,

36:24.494 --> 36:26.662
So that's a huge relief.

36:26.729 --> 36:27.696
Good.

36:27.764 --> 36:29.430
Yeah.

36:29.498 --> 36:30.665
Lou, about yesterday...

36:30.732 --> 36:32.267
You know, dad, it's okay.

36:32.334 --> 36:33.701
We both agreed
to sell the dude ranch

36:33.769 --> 36:36.604
And I got cold feet,
that's all.

36:37.540 --> 36:40.608
I didn't wanna run it
by myself.

36:41.510 --> 36:43.578
It was a pretty good partnership
while it lasted.

36:43.646 --> 36:47.447
It was a great partnership,
and I'd do it again.

36:50.017 --> 36:51.084
(spartan grunts)

36:53.288 --> 36:54.388
<i>Ty:
Hey.</i>

36:56.191 --> 36:57.257
Hey.

36:58.193 --> 36:59.826
We should get going.

36:59.894 --> 37:02.094
You're gonna be late.

37:02.162 --> 37:06.165
It's too late anyway,
we'd never make it.

37:09.736 --> 37:11.937
I don't understand, Amy.

37:12.005 --> 37:13.806
Everyone's gonna be there.

37:13.873 --> 37:14.907
All the people that love you

37:14.974 --> 37:16.609
Are gonna wanna see you
graduate.

37:16.677 --> 37:19.010
No, not everyone, Ty.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.881
You know there was a moment,
last night,

37:23.949 --> 37:28.452
When I was trying to get
spartan to stand up,

37:28.520 --> 37:32.756
I thought maybe
my mom was there.

37:32.824 --> 37:34.758
It was just for a second.

37:34.826 --> 37:37.595
Then I remembered
that she's gone,

37:37.662 --> 37:40.630
And she's not gonna be here
to see me graduate

37:40.698 --> 37:43.366
Or help me pack for university.

37:44.268 --> 37:47.503
Ty, spartan's all I have
left of her

37:47.571 --> 37:48.871
And I almost lost him
last night

37:48.939 --> 37:51.807
'cause I wasn't paying
attention.

37:52.743 --> 37:55.211
I'm not going anywhere.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.080
Did Amy come with you?

37:59.148 --> 38:01.550
<i>Jack: No. She was still at
the clinic when we left.</i>

38:01.618 --> 38:02.884
Well, she better hurry up,

38:02.952 --> 38:04.085
Or she's gonna miss
her own graduation.

38:04.153 --> 38:05.487
<i>Woman:
Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

38:05.555 --> 38:07.723
It is my pleasure
to welcome you

38:07.790 --> 38:09.591
To Hudson high's graduation.

38:09.659 --> 38:11.260
We better get some seats.

38:11.327 --> 38:12.993
<i>Woman: We are so proud of
this years' graduates</i>

38:13.061 --> 38:14.662
<i>And we thank you all
for being here today</i>

38:14.730 --> 38:16.196
<i>To celebrate...</i>

38:17.132 --> 38:19.867
(approaching footsteps)

38:21.202 --> 38:22.870
Badger and I will stay
with spartan.

38:22.937 --> 38:26.006
We'll call you
if anything happens.

38:26.074 --> 38:28.308
You put them up to this?

38:28.376 --> 38:30.009
I told you I'm not going.

38:30.077 --> 38:32.145
<i>Badger:
Look, Amy...</i>

38:32.212 --> 38:33.647
I know I messed up
with spartan,

38:33.714 --> 38:36.783
But don't miss your own
graduation because of me.

38:40.721 --> 38:42.989
It's your call.

38:45.124 --> 38:46.925
(applause and cheers)

38:48.495 --> 38:50.629
<i>Woman:
Chris Evans.</i>

38:54.334 --> 38:55.401
<i>Amy Fleming.</i>

38:55.468 --> 38:56.568
(applause)

38:58.171 --> 39:00.272
<i>Woman:
Amy Fleming.</i>

39:00.339 --> 39:02.039
(confused murmuring)

39:03.008 --> 39:04.442
<i>(distant rumble of an engine)</i>

39:11.116 --> 39:13.150
(cheering and applause
from crowd)

39:18.122 --> 39:19.656
(laughing)

39:19.724 --> 39:21.458
Don't forget this.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.493
(cheering and applause)

39:26.030 --> 39:27.364
Amy Fleming?

39:27.432 --> 39:28.665
Yes, that's me.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.035
(cheering and applause)

39:38.842 --> 39:40.810
<i>Woman: And now this
year's valedictorian,</i>

39:40.877 --> 39:42.211
<i>Soraya Duvall.</i>

39:42.278 --> 39:43.679
(applause)

39:52.120 --> 39:54.522
I've been thinking a lot
about the future.

39:54.590 --> 39:58.360
Everything seems so uncertain,
like anything could happen.

39:58.427 --> 40:02.163
<i>But maybe graduation is about
accepting uncertainty;</i>

40:02.231 --> 40:04.865
Accepting that we don't have
all the answers

40:04.932 --> 40:07.835
<i>And we're gonna screw up
sometimes.</i>

40:07.902 --> 40:11.037
That doesn't mean we should be
afraid to keep going,

40:11.105 --> 40:13.006
<i>And to take big, bold steps -</i>

40:13.074 --> 40:16.410
<i>Even if that means
we fall down now and then.</i>

40:16.478 --> 40:20.113
<i>Today, we take the first step
together.</i>

40:20.181 --> 40:21.714
So, even if we fall,

40:21.782 --> 40:24.984
<i>At least we'll be there
to help each other up.</i>

40:25.051 --> 40:27.019
<i>So...</i>

40:27.087 --> 40:28.521
I guess that's it.

40:28.589 --> 40:30.356
Congratulations, guys,
we did it!

40:30.424 --> 40:33.325
(cheering, whistling,
and applause)

40:39.399 --> 40:40.799
Soraya:
(giggles)

40:41.734 --> 40:43.735
(cheering and applause)

40:52.445 --> 40:54.079
<i>(moans)</i>

40:54.147 --> 40:57.516
There's a million tiny gnomes
with sledgehammers in my head.

40:59.686 --> 41:01.687
<i>Caleb:
Drink this.</i>

41:01.754 --> 41:04.356
You know, you missed Amy
and Soraya's graduation.

41:04.424 --> 41:07.192
(sighs) I couldn't face them.

41:07.259 --> 41:09.560
It's humiliating
being a dropout.

41:09.628 --> 41:11.262
Yeah, well...

41:12.198 --> 41:14.265
Got you something.

41:16.702 --> 41:18.169
What are those for?

41:18.237 --> 41:20.371
It's everything you need
to get your GED online.

41:20.439 --> 41:22.105
I borrowed it from Ty.

41:22.173 --> 41:24.208
You're smart, Ashley,
and I know that.

41:24.275 --> 41:25.675
So...

41:25.743 --> 41:27.644
Whatever you wanna be
when you grow up,

41:27.712 --> 41:29.213
I wanna be part of it.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.613
And I want you to stop thinking

41:30.681 --> 41:32.916
Your future's in the garbage.

41:32.984 --> 41:34.784
You're right.

41:34.853 --> 41:36.786
And just to clarify,

41:36.854 --> 41:41.858
I didn't actually think
my future was in the garbage.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.095
Thank you.

41:46.163 --> 41:48.064
You're welcome.

41:48.131 --> 41:49.999
(laughs)

41:50.067 --> 41:51.700
Cute.

41:51.768 --> 41:54.435
<i>Jack: Well, that was
quite the entrance.</i>

41:54.503 --> 41:56.804
Tim: You cut it a little
close, don't you think?

41:56.873 --> 41:58.439
(laughs)
congratulations, honey.

41:58.507 --> 41:59.774
Thanks, dad.

41:59.842 --> 42:01.076
Tim:
I'm so proud of you.

42:01.143 --> 42:02.477
Thank you.

42:03.779 --> 42:05.247
Guys, I just, um...

42:05.314 --> 42:06.748
<i>There's something I wanna say
to all of you.</i>

42:06.815 --> 42:08.716
I...

42:08.784 --> 42:10.885
I'm not giving up on school,
okay?

42:10.952 --> 42:13.820
But I think I need
to take a year off.

42:13.889 --> 42:15.055
A year just to expand
my clinics

42:15.123 --> 42:18.125
And see what I can really do.

42:19.227 --> 42:20.961
Lou, I...

42:21.029 --> 42:22.863
<i>I know you mean well,</i>

42:22.931 --> 42:25.464
But I'm not gonna take
that scholarship.

42:25.532 --> 42:26.599
I know.

42:28.969 --> 42:30.370
You disappointed?

42:30.437 --> 42:33.773
I am way too proud of you
to be disappointed.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.408
Come here...

42:42.782 --> 42:45.517
I didn't mean what I said.

42:46.819 --> 42:49.288
I wouldn't take it back.

42:49.355 --> 42:52.190
As far as first kisses go,

42:52.258 --> 42:54.592
Mine was pretty good.

42:58.863 --> 43:00.197
Jake:
Are you ready to go?

43:00.265 --> 43:01.732
Uh, yeah.

43:01.800 --> 43:04.268
Um, you're gonna stay
with spartan

43:04.336 --> 43:06.270
Until Amy gets back?

43:06.338 --> 43:07.438
Yeah.

43:07.505 --> 43:09.974
I'm not going anywhere.

43:16.513 --> 43:18.681
Listen, before I forget,

43:18.749 --> 43:22.518
(clears throat)
keys to the dude ranch.

43:22.586 --> 43:24.988
These are yours.
Lou, listen.

43:25.056 --> 43:26.356
I wanna propose

43:26.424 --> 43:28.658
That you and I run
the dude ranch together,

43:28.725 --> 43:30.192
Equal partners,

43:30.260 --> 43:31.760
If you're interested.

43:31.828 --> 43:33.695
I'll just buy Tim's half,
and you keep the other half.

43:33.763 --> 43:36.198
But, Lisa, I'm not gonna
live here anymore.

43:36.266 --> 43:37.967
It won't be easy,
but we'll make it work.

43:38.034 --> 43:39.335
It won't be impossible;

43:39.402 --> 43:40.869
That's why they invented
the Internet.

43:40.937 --> 43:42.304
I don't know what to say.

43:42.372 --> 43:44.139
I think you should say yes.

43:44.207 --> 43:44.906
Terrific.

43:44.974 --> 43:46.040
(elated laughter)

43:48.077 --> 43:50.744
Amy: Okay, see you.
Girl: Bye, Amy.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.681
I'm proud of you.

43:53.748 --> 43:56.917
Thanks.
I'm proud of me too.

43:56.985 --> 43:59.620
How does it feel
to be a graduate?

43:59.688 --> 44:01.555
It feels like...

44:01.623 --> 44:04.124

44:04.192 --> 44:07.594

your kiss good night ♪
