WEBVTT

00:06.399 --> 00:07.600
Josh.

00:09.705 --> 00:12.624
Fuck. No, no, no, no, no!

00:12.626 --> 00:13.785
Beluga caviar?

00:13.786 --> 00:14.787
Fuck!

00:14.788 --> 00:17.065
All of a sudden I'm housemates
with Vladimir Putin.

00:17.066 --> 00:18.066
(LAUGHS)

00:18.067 --> 00:19.585
Arnold got that for me
for Valentine's Day.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.104
Oh, it expired on Sunday.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.425
Shit.

00:22.426 --> 00:23.825
How much is that?

00:23.826 --> 00:27.384
- Like, $150.
- $150?

00:27.385 --> 00:29.904
How did you forget to eat
$150 worth of caviar?

00:29.905 --> 00:31.904
Well, Tom, we were waiting
for the perfect moment

00:31.905 --> 00:33.264
but then it never came.

00:33.265 --> 00:34.265
Well, that's poetic.

00:34.266 --> 00:35.505
Maybe it's still good?

00:38.904 --> 00:40.824
That was fucking creepy.

00:40.825 --> 00:42.491
That's how you taste caviar!

00:44.664 --> 00:46.023
Is it okay to eat?

00:46.024 --> 00:48.183
I don't know. I've never had it
before and it tastes sort of off

00:48.184 --> 00:49.184
but, like, in a good way.

00:49.185 --> 00:51.062
- Yeah, I'm into it.
- 'Cause it tastes like pussy?

00:51.063 --> 00:52.064
Mm.

00:52.065 --> 00:56.902
If that's what you taste like then I
just... you need to change something.

00:56.903 --> 00:58.783
Hey, do you know what I
think you'd really love?

00:58.784 --> 01:02.742
Like, a really pretty guy
with, like, cute curly hair,

01:02.743 --> 01:04.622
and a very good BMI, like,

01:04.623 --> 01:06.862
- does lots of nice compliments...
- Oh, yeah?

01:06.863 --> 01:10.502
Very smart and does
surprisingly romantic things

01:10.503 --> 01:12.461
and maybe he's got a bit of money
but he's not arrogant.

01:12.462 --> 01:14.341
- Yeah, Arnold is quite good. Yep.
- Yeah.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.221
But you just can't make
yourself love him.

01:16.222 --> 01:17.382
Not anymore.

01:17.383 --> 01:20.260
For me, the question here is,
what's wrong with you?

01:20.261 --> 01:21.462
Face.

01:24.021 --> 01:25.500
Is that a speck of mould?

01:25.501 --> 01:26.661
I don't know.

01:26.662 --> 01:28.060
Just eat around it.

01:28.061 --> 01:29.061
I love you.

01:29.062 --> 01:32.701
I am feeling optimistic and
enthusiastic about my dating future.

01:33.181 --> 01:36.020
* One, two. One, two, three, four *

01:36.021 --> 01:37.699
* Ooh *

01:37.700 --> 01:40.979
- * Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah, yeah *
- * Ooh *

01:40.980 --> 01:43.979
- * Ooh *
- * Okay *

01:43.980 --> 01:46.658
- * Ooh *
- * Oh, the good Lord knows it *

01:46.659 --> 01:49.338
- * Ooh *
- * Oh, the good Lord knows it *

01:49.339 --> 01:51.299
- * Ooh *
- * I left better behind *

01:51.300 --> 01:55.338
* I'll be fine, yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:55.339 --> 01:57.977
* Make my mamma turn another blind eye *

01:57.978 --> 01:59.778
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... *

01:59.779 --> 02:01.617
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

02:01.618 --> 02:02.819
* I'll be fine *

02:06.618 --> 02:09.256
A bus is here. I mean,
this just must be him.

02:09.257 --> 02:12.056
Why is Tom still talking
to the real estate agent?

02:12.057 --> 02:15.136
Is it a girl with low self-esteem?

02:15.137 --> 02:17.738
This house is so ugly
and he's pretending it isn't.

02:20.097 --> 02:21.456
No one got out.

02:21.457 --> 02:23.137
Why did no one get out?

02:25.097 --> 02:27.255
(GRINDR NOTIFICATION ALERT)

02:27.256 --> 02:29.615
He just messaged and said
that he's ten minutes away.

02:29.616 --> 02:30.855
He's said that quite a lot.

02:30.856 --> 02:32.495
- Many times.
- (GRINDR NOTIFICATION ALERT)

02:32.496 --> 02:36.095
Oh, no, Ella, he just said he's in
school uniform and hopes that's okay.

02:36.096 --> 02:37.096
Is that okay?

02:37.097 --> 02:38.534
Josh, how old is this boy?

02:38.535 --> 02:40.295
I don't know, it doesn't
say on his profile.

02:40.296 --> 02:42.894
I mean, he looks adult. I
promise he looks like an adult.

02:42.895 --> 02:44.494
- Ask him.
- Yeah.

02:44.495 --> 02:46.054
- (GRINDR ALERT)
- He's 18.

02:46.055 --> 02:47.774
That's quite young.
Who do you think you are?

02:47.775 --> 02:50.133
- Tom?
- (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

02:50.134 --> 02:52.534
- (GRINDR ALERT)
- Oh, God.

02:52.535 --> 02:53.933
What?

02:53.934 --> 02:55.893
He wants me to pee on him.

02:55.894 --> 02:57.094
Will you pee on him?

02:57.095 --> 02:58.614
I don't know, it just
seems I'm a bit young

02:58.615 --> 03:01.173
to start experimenting that
hard with my sex life.

03:01.174 --> 03:02.294
He's 18.

03:02.295 --> 03:04.812
Kids these days! Am I right?

03:04.813 --> 03:07.732
So many people just love being peed on.

03:07.733 --> 03:08.317
(GRINDR ALERT)

03:08.319 --> 03:10.093
He says he won't come
if I don't pee on him.

03:10.094 --> 03:12.772
He hasn't left yet? What's going on?

03:12.773 --> 03:15.333
Should I just pee on him?
I mean, I've already come this far.

03:17.213 --> 03:18.333
Yeah, I vote yes.

03:18.334 --> 03:20.131
All right, I'm saying yes.

03:20.132 --> 03:22.131
- (SQUEALS)
- You said I should!

03:22.132 --> 03:23.801
I'm not sure that I thought it through!

03:24.978 --> 03:27.771
Oh, no, he just said he's in a
wheelchair and he hopes that's okay.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.851
Oh, no...

03:29.852 --> 03:30.851
Oh, no.

03:30.852 --> 03:32.651
You know what's happening
here, don't you?

03:32.652 --> 03:34.730
Yeah, this boy doesn't exist.

03:34.731 --> 03:35.732
You're talking to

03:35.733 --> 03:37.610
perhaps an anonymous group
of friends at a party

03:37.611 --> 03:42.090
and they are laughing at you for
agreeing to pee on a school kid.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.091
Yep.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.930
How are you feeling?

03:44.931 --> 03:48.609
I'm feeling like I learnt a lot
about myself and the world.

03:48.610 --> 03:51.489
Maybe you guys want to
hang out with me, yeah?

03:51.490 --> 03:55.850
Oh, I wish. We've got so
many more houses to look at.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074

04:11.049 --> 04:12.608
What's all this, then?

04:13.609 --> 04:15.287
I've taken up boxing training.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.728
(MUM) She's just showing off.

04:16.728 --> 04:19.367
You're gonna be a million dollar baby.

04:19.368 --> 04:23.167
Million dollar baby was thin and fit.

04:23.168 --> 04:25.047
And rich and dead.

04:25.048 --> 04:26.566
See, some women can have it all.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.807
Sounds fun. Maybe I'll join you.
Maybe I'll do some boxing.

04:28.808 --> 04:32.966
No son of mine is going to be
hitting people for fun, Josh.

04:32.967 --> 04:34.646
I'll only hit bad guys.

04:34.647 --> 04:36.046
Like robbers, etc.

04:36.047 --> 04:40.126
Why can't you ever take my side?

04:40.127 --> 04:42.926
I mean, I take your
side plenty, don't I?

04:42.927 --> 04:45.725
You liked boxing yesterday.
You should have been here then.

04:45.726 --> 04:47.953
You would've been on her side.
Maybe come back tomorrow?

04:47.955 --> 04:50.325
Stop talking about me as
though I'm not even here!

04:50.326 --> 04:52.445
Hello! Am I here?

04:52.446 --> 04:54.085
Can anybody hear me?

04:54.086 --> 04:55.804
Mum, we're just playing,
okay. Calm down.

04:55.805 --> 04:57.525
Hannah, go to your room.

04:57.526 --> 04:59.260
I've been grounded again.

05:00.398 --> 05:02.044
You can go too, Josh.

05:02.758 --> 05:04.203
Okay, see ya.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.244
- See ya, little munchkin.
- Oh, piss off!

05:06.245 --> 05:07.884
- She's a little munchkin.
- Piss off!

05:10.724 --> 05:11.924
(MAN) Okay.

05:13.004 --> 05:15.243
This is me when I have
my plastic surgery.

05:15.244 --> 05:17.123
- Looks good, better.
- (LAUGHS)

05:17.124 --> 05:19.923
When are you back
so we can do sex things?

05:19.924 --> 05:22.802
Two weeks, but we can't do sex things.

05:22.803 --> 05:25.722
Why not? Why can't we do sex things?

05:25.723 --> 05:27.283
I have a girlfriend now.

05:28.283 --> 05:29.323
A girlfriend?

05:29.324 --> 05:31.602
Yeah. A girlfriend.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.729
And you do sex with her?

05:34.722 --> 05:35.923
Yes.

05:36.722 --> 05:39.080
Well, that's cool, isn't it?

05:39.682 --> 05:41.002
Very modern.

05:43.522 --> 05:45.320
- (ELLA BURPS)
- (TOM) Did you just burp?

05:45.321 --> 05:46.641
Yeah.

05:46.642 --> 05:48.640
I'm sick of sexuality being fluid.

05:48.641 --> 05:50.920
I miss the days when your gays were
gay, your straights were straight

05:50.921 --> 05:52.386
and your bisexuals were lying.

05:56.121 --> 05:59.223
(MAN) Last time I tried to
fly it was so embarrassing.

06:00.039 --> 06:01.960
I got so scared when we
hit a bit of turbulence

06:01.961 --> 06:04.239
and I accidentally grabbed the
hand of the man next to me.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.471
There isn't anywhere
safer than in a plane.

06:06.473 --> 06:08.356
I mean, it's such a
controlled environment.

06:08.358 --> 06:10.519
Like, there's such a bigger chance
that I murder you right now

06:10.520 --> 06:11.918
than you'll die in a plane crash.

06:11.919 --> 06:12.847
Don't you think?

06:13.643 --> 06:15.959
I have never seen anyone
more scared of flying than me.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.118
I'm such a baby about it.
It's so embarrassing.

06:19.119 --> 06:21.518
Just, what I think, I
think the key is, right,

06:21.519 --> 06:23.518
is to just stop being
afraid of death altogether.

06:23.519 --> 06:26.317
Don't you think it's a little bit
arrogant to be scared of dying?

06:26.318 --> 06:28.798
Like, in the grand scheme of
things, like the billions people

06:28.799 --> 06:31.877
and the millions of years and
the stardust and the mammoths,

06:31.878 --> 06:33.357
and... Taylor Swift,

06:33.358 --> 06:37.038
I dunno, it just seems like... like
you don't really matter that much.

06:38.037 --> 06:39.064
You know?

06:39.558 --> 06:41.036
Wow, I'm cured.

06:41.037 --> 06:43.876
(LAUGHS) Yeah, I fixed it.

06:43.877 --> 06:45.597
- He cured me, Bastion.
- Yeah.

06:49.157 --> 06:51.037
- (MOBILE PHONE RINGS)
- I'm sorry.

06:53.036 --> 06:55.155
Hey, Ma. I'm sorry, I can't really talk.

06:55.156 --> 06:56.795
Josh, Hannah has been ignoring me.

06:56.796 --> 07:01.115
She hasn't spoken to me for days
and I didn't do anything at all.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.955
She's just being so mean to me.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.435
I'm sorry, Mum. I'm on a
date and I have to go.

07:05.436 --> 07:06.834
You aren't on a date.

07:06.835 --> 07:07.995
I am on a date.

07:07.996 --> 07:09.675
No, you're just trying to get rid of me.

07:09.676 --> 07:11.754
Is it really so hard for you
to believe that I'm on a date?

07:11.755 --> 07:13.354
You are lying, Joshua.

07:13.355 --> 07:14.834
I know when you're lying.
I'm your mother.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.154
You're just trying to get rid of me.

07:16.155 --> 07:17.954
Can you please tell my mother you exist?

07:17.955 --> 07:19.153
I exist.

07:19.154 --> 07:20.946
- Oh, hello.
- Okay?

07:20.948 --> 07:22.347
Oh, fine!

07:29.681 --> 07:31.121
Do you want to punch?

07:32.114 --> 07:33.792
The bag.

07:33.793 --> 07:36.673
Not me. Don't punch me.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.872
You have a lot of big books,
you must be pretty smart.

07:49.873 --> 07:51.231
I'm a podiatrist.

07:51.232 --> 07:53.392
I don't know why I said that about
the books. Okay, I have books.

07:53.393 --> 07:55.271
I want you to know that.
Like, it's not weird to me.

07:55.272 --> 07:56.471
Like, I'm smart.

07:56.472 --> 07:59.151
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Okay, now we're both smart.

07:59.152 --> 08:00.471
Thank you.

08:00.472 --> 08:02.191
I probably have nicer feet, though.

08:02.192 --> 08:04.151
I mean, I used to have
real bad ingrown toenails

08:04.152 --> 08:05.791
but they're fine now.

08:07.847 --> 08:09.710
Is... is that a good anecdote for you?

08:09.711 --> 08:11.309
Is that the kind of
anecdote you like to hear?

08:11.310 --> 08:13.591
It was until you said you're okay now.

08:15.431 --> 08:17.550
There's no money in healthy toenails.

08:23.790 --> 08:25.270
You're a good kisser.

08:26.269 --> 08:29.268
Don't really know what that means.

08:29.269 --> 08:30.350
(SIGHS) Just give me a minute.

08:30.351 --> 08:32.227
I like to smoke a bit before sex.

08:32.229 --> 08:33.229
Do you want some?

08:33.230 --> 08:35.109
No, thank you.

08:39.669 --> 08:40.868
Is that meth?

08:41.789 --> 08:43.866
Yeah. I just have a little bit.

08:43.868 --> 08:45.117
Sure, of course.

08:46.069 --> 08:48.028
It's Tuesday night, after all.

08:49.588 --> 08:51.747
He smoked meth. Actual meth.

08:51.748 --> 08:54.707
Yep. He's a podiatrist
and he had a terrarium

08:54.708 --> 08:57.786
and it tricked me into thinking
that it's okay to smoke meth.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.066
What did you do?

08:59.067 --> 09:03.946
Uh, well, I waited for him to finish
smoking his meth and then we had sex,

09:03.947 --> 09:07.626
which... I would've thought that I
wouldn't have had sex with someone

09:07.627 --> 09:10.705
after they smoked meth,
but no, there I was doing it.

09:10.707 --> 09:13.426
Turns out I am surprisingly easygoing.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.985
Could you get me a glass of water?

09:14.986 --> 09:16.186
Yeah.

09:17.786 --> 09:19.705
You're Aboriginal, yeah?

09:19.706 --> 09:21.384
I'm Wurundjeri on my mum's side.

09:21.385 --> 09:22.665
That's cool.

09:22.666 --> 09:23.746
Is it cool, is it?

09:23.748 --> 09:25.823
Very cool, very chic.
I'm stuck being white.

09:25.825 --> 09:28.584
- White people are the worst.
- Some of my best friends are white.

09:28.585 --> 09:29.585
Well, all of mine are.

09:29.586 --> 09:31.605
All right, it's not a competition.

09:32.426 --> 09:36.063
I feel very awkward and weird
about how horrible we've been.

09:36.064 --> 09:38.703
Really, I do. I feel quite
anxious talking about it.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.384
I'm sorry you feel anxious.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

09:41.385 --> 09:43.943
So we went quite hard on
the murder and the rape

09:43.944 --> 09:46.103
- and the oppression thing, didn't we?
- Yep.

09:46.104 --> 09:48.222
Not me. I didn't. I wouldn't.

09:48.223 --> 09:50.342
- I would never, I promise.
- Oh, thank you. I appreciate that.

09:50.343 --> 09:51.343
Yeah.

09:51.344 --> 09:56.143
My great-granddad though, whoa.
I mean, he probably would have.

09:56.144 --> 09:59.887
You know, he would be furious
to see me here on a date with you.

09:59.889 --> 10:01.222
It's presumptuous to call this a date.

10:01.223 --> 10:02.221
It's sort of a date.

10:02.222 --> 10:03.222
Is it a date,

10:03.223 --> 10:05.461
or the world's worst application
for Young Australian of the Year?

10:05.462 --> 10:07.502
I mean, we didn't let
Aboriginal people go to school

10:07.503 --> 10:09.181
until, like, 30 years ago.

10:09.182 --> 10:11.581
Yep. I know. I guarantee you
I know all about this.

10:11.582 --> 10:13.700
Fuck, that's recent,
you know what I mean?

10:13.701 --> 10:16.541
Like, that's very... Fuck, shit,
that's like your parents' generation,

10:16.542 --> 10:17.541
you know?

10:17.542 --> 10:19.860
And then you get all these
white people, who are not me,

10:19.861 --> 10:21.860
and they're furious about these programs

10:21.861 --> 10:24.380
that are just aimed at helping
Aboriginal communities catch up,

10:24.381 --> 10:25.659
and it's just very, like...

10:25.660 --> 10:28.060
It's all very... just
a bit shit, you know?

10:28.061 --> 10:31.379
Like, everyone's just still so racist.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.420
Not me, obviously.

10:33.421 --> 10:34.939
Because I am here on a date with you.

10:34.940 --> 10:37.419
- Thank heavens.
- A lucky boy.

10:37.420 --> 10:38.860
(SIGHS)

10:40.019 --> 10:42.659
I mean, you can't hail a taxi, can you?

10:42.660 --> 10:45.619
Like, taxis aren't stopping for
Aboriginal people, are they?

10:45.620 --> 10:48.579
Oh, you're probably fine.
I mean, you're so tidy.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.978
If you go out in an unironed
shirt, then I just...

10:50.979 --> 10:54.058
I mean, have you ever successfully
hailed a taxi in an unironed shirt?

10:54.059 --> 10:56.378
Oh, I don't go out in unironed shirts.

10:56.379 --> 10:57.379
Okay.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.937
I mean, taxis, they just stop for me.

10:58.938 --> 11:00.457
You know, sorry, but they do.
They just stop.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.578
There's nothing I can do about it.

11:01.579 --> 11:03.017
Even if I don't iron,
they just stop for me.

11:03.018 --> 11:05.337
You keep going on about this,
I'm not going to have sex with you.

11:05.338 --> 11:08.097
Are you... are you maybe
gonna have sex with me?

11:08.098 --> 11:09.336
I've come this far.

11:09.337 --> 11:11.937
No. I don't think you
should, to be honest.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.257
I mean, haven't my people
already put you through enough?

11:28.576 --> 11:30.695
He gave me a Hickey. Look at it.

11:30.696 --> 11:31.696
Urgh!

11:31.697 --> 11:33.375
Yeah. Look what he did to me.

11:33.376 --> 11:35.654
That is so creepy.
That is actually so creepy.

11:35.655 --> 11:37.095
He's trying to mark you.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.454
I mean, I can't go and see
Arnold with a Hickey.

11:39.455 --> 11:40.855
Temporary tattoo.

11:40.857 --> 11:42.534
I've got one of a scorpion.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.774
How do I convince him I wanted
a tattoo of a scorpion?

11:44.775 --> 11:45.815
Say a kid did it.

11:45.816 --> 11:48.414
What? That is just the stupid...

11:48.415 --> 11:51.235
That is so unbelievable.

11:52.455 --> 11:53.654
You could just wear a scarf.

11:53.655 --> 11:56.173
Yeah, I thought about that,
but then what if we get naked?

11:56.174 --> 11:57.773
You're gonna get naked with Arnold?

11:57.774 --> 11:59.773
I really don't want to, but
also I'm a very shit guy,

11:59.774 --> 12:02.372
and if he's standing there looking
cute and he's forward enough,

12:02.373 --> 12:03.653
then of course I will.

12:03.654 --> 12:05.732
Of course, of course.

12:05.733 --> 12:09.133
Scratch it with a stick so it looks
like you fell out of a tree?

12:10.133 --> 12:12.854
(SIGHS HEAVILY) Oh, um...

12:13.726 --> 12:16.012
I mean, I don't like
the idea of the pain,

12:16.013 --> 12:19.252
but I do like in him thinking that
I'm happy enough to climb trees.

12:19.253 --> 12:21.972
- Yeah!
- Google says to use toothpaste.

12:21.973 --> 12:25.011
No, that's not a true thing.
Toothpaste isn't magic.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.012
You could just try it.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.291
Then I won't be able to try the stick.

12:27.292 --> 12:28.006
Why?

12:28.008 --> 12:29.531
Because if I have to wait till tomorrow

12:29.532 --> 12:30.532
to see if the toothpaste works

12:30.533 --> 12:33.052
the scratch will be too fresh
to have believably bruised.

12:36.251 --> 12:40.290
I mean, I don't think I can convince
him that I wanted to climb a tree.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.290
- Is it there?
- Yep.

12:42.291 --> 12:43.529
Just quiet.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.010
- (SQUEAKS)
- Ahhhhh!

12:47.290 --> 12:49.138
- How is it?
- Oh, yeah.

12:49.690 --> 12:50.969
- It's good.
- Yeah, it's good.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.010
This has been such a productive day.

12:54.290 --> 12:57.488
Who gave you a Hickey? And why do
you have a scratch on your neck?

12:57.489 --> 12:58.569
I've been doing mischief.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.610
- Oooh!
- Are you dating already?

13:01.612 --> 13:02.570
Is he fun?

13:02.572 --> 13:05.295
I feel optimistic and
enthusiastic about the future.

13:05.297 --> 13:07.328
What's the Arnold status?

13:07.330 --> 13:09.207
He was meant to come over
today but he didn't show up.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.987
- Oh, did he say why?
- He said something came up.

13:11.989 --> 13:13.327
Oh, that's vague.

13:13.328 --> 13:14.529
Yeah, and that's his whole shtick.

13:14.530 --> 13:15.887
Well, it's a shit shtick.

13:15.888 --> 13:18.847
Jeez, I'm getting sick of this
mysterious business he's doing.

13:18.848 --> 13:20.937
You're not Willy Wonka, Arnold!

13:21.431 --> 13:23.606
Grow up and pull your bloody head in.

13:23.607 --> 13:26.127
I know you've got mental
issues, but Christ, boy,

13:26.128 --> 13:28.326
you can't play with people willy-nilly.

13:28.327 --> 13:30.846
Because he's not Willy Wonka?

13:30.847 --> 13:34.086
Yeah, he can't play willy-nilly
because he's not Willy Wonka, yes.

13:34.087 --> 13:36.806
But he look like Willy Wonka, right?

13:36.807 --> 13:38.405
I've seen him in velvet pants.

13:38.406 --> 13:41.485
- (GASPS) He is Willy Wonka! (LAUGHS)
- Yeah.

13:41.486 --> 13:44.165
Don't try and Oompa-Loompa your
way out of this one, Wonka.

13:57.406 --> 13:59.219
About 12 seconds ago.

14:00.498 --> 14:02.439
Do you think she's thinking
of killing herself?

14:02.441 --> 14:04.603
No. I mean, she packed bags.

14:04.604 --> 14:06.644
Do you think she's expecting
to get into heaven?

14:06.645 --> 14:09.203
Okay. What happened?

14:09.204 --> 14:10.205
Oh, you know.

14:10.206 --> 14:12.843
She was just getting really intense
and I told her to piss off,

14:12.844 --> 14:14.323
but I didn't mean out of the house.

14:14.324 --> 14:16.282
I just wanted her out of my knee circle.

14:16.283 --> 14:17.723
Okay. Cool. I'll call her and find her.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.882
Thanks for calling and letting me know.
Seriously, okay. Thanks.

14:19.883 --> 14:22.522
- Bye.
- Okay, bye. Can you please pull over?

14:22.523 --> 14:24.162
Sure. Is everything okay?

14:24.163 --> 14:26.442
I think it will be. Do you?

14:26.443 --> 14:27.643
Oh, I think so.

Yes.

14:47.802 --> 14:48.881
Where to?

14:48.882 --> 14:50.921
I haven't decided yet.

14:50.922 --> 14:53.400
Okay. Hannah said you had a fight.

I don't know why she's
being so mean to me.

14:58.321 --> 14:59.560
Did you ask her?

14:59.561 --> 15:02.480
No, she didn't listen. She never speaks.

15:02.481 --> 15:04.959
She could basically be a Buddhist monk

15:04.960 --> 15:06.639
if she didn't drink so
much chocolate milk.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.880
All right. Well, then...
What's the plan now?

15:10.880 --> 15:14.319
I guess that I go home
and I confront Hannah.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.918
No, please don't. Just not today.

15:15.919 --> 15:17.798
Just let things calm
down a bit, maybe, yeah?

15:17.799 --> 15:20.397
Okay. I won't talk to her, then.

talk to her, just maybe not today.

I hope you're not
expecting child support.

16:22.554 --> 16:25.553
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's just
a little scary, isn't it?

16:25.554 --> 16:27.437
It's okay. I just got tested.

Mm-mm. No, I'm very responsible.

downfall her hygiene?

Okay. Um, when was the
last time you got tested?

16:47.170 --> 16:49.912
Well, I don't really get tested,
because I'm always so safe.

16:51.912 --> 16:53.112
Right.

16:53.911 --> 16:57.550
I lied because I wanted you
to stop looking scared.

16:57.551 --> 17:00.391

time, so I think it's okay.

Do we have to get PEP?

17:06.431 --> 17:07.471
What is PEP?

17:07.472 --> 17:09.270
Seriously? You don't know what PEP is?

17:09.271 --> 17:10.271
I feel judged.

17:10.271 --> 17:13.435
PEP is like the morning
after pill, but for HIV.

17:13.436 --> 17:14.909
Okay, cool. Let's get PEP.

17:14.910 --> 17:18.189
It's not that easy, though, is it?

17:18.190 --> 17:20.589
It can make you sort of
quite ill sometimes.

17:20.882 --> 17:21.882
Shit.

17:21.884 --> 17:23.147
It's fine.

two years. I can handle it.

(LAUGHS UNCERTAINLY)

17:29.469 --> 17:31.948
I think we should go and get
tested for HIV together instead.

17:31.949 --> 17:33.508
I know it's not perfect,
but I think it's fine.

17:33.509 --> 17:34.907
I think it's acceptable risk.

17:34.908 --> 17:37.268
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:37.269 --> 17:40.707
How many sexual partners have
you had in the last six months?

17:40.708 --> 17:42.629
- Um...
- Roughly?

17:43.668 --> 17:44.868
12.

17:46.308 --> 17:47.308
Is that a lot?

17:47.309 --> 17:50.987
How many of those partners did
you do receptive anal sex with?

17:50.988 --> 17:53.146
Only, like, two. Yeah.

17:53.147 --> 17:55.726
I know I seem really bottomy,
but actually I really don't like it.

17:55.728 --> 17:58.066
How many have you had
penetrative anal sex with?

17:58.067 --> 17:59.267
10.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.766
And how many were just oral?

18:01.768 --> 18:03.066
Oh, we're including just oral?

18:03.067 --> 18:05.346
I didn't know we were including
just oral, I'm sorry.

18:05.347 --> 18:08.946
Um... Then it's like 16,
I think. Is that a lot?

18:08.947 --> 18:11.105
I mean, 16, that seems
like a lot, doesn't it?

18:11.106 --> 18:13.745
I'm just trying to, like, get
myself out there, you know?

18:13.746 --> 18:16.705
Just trying to meet people
and exist in the world.

18:16.706 --> 18:18.345
You know what I mean?

18:18.346 --> 18:21.025
- Just trying to live.
- Mm-hm.

18:21.026 --> 18:22.545
You don't care.

18:31.345 --> 18:33.664
That should take about 20 minutes.

18:40.024 --> 18:41.982
Hey, do you want to hear
something interesting?

18:41.983 --> 18:43.983
Gosh, you've hyped it up, haven't you?

18:44.780 --> 18:46.743
Last time I was at the
hospital my gran died.

18:46.744 --> 18:48.022
(LAUGHS)

18:48.023 --> 18:49.302
Sorry.

18:49.303 --> 18:51.782
Awkward for you.

18:51.783 --> 18:53.382
It's fine.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.822
So it was all very sad,
and we left the room.

18:55.823 --> 18:58.822
Then as I was heading down the
hall I see from her doorway

18:58.823 --> 19:01.382
that we've left the light on, and
she hates wasting electricity.

19:01.383 --> 19:02.382
So I went to turn it off,

19:02.383 --> 19:04.902
but when I get there,
the light isn't on.

19:04.903 --> 19:08.806
It's her body. Her body was
actually emanating the glow.

19:09.479 --> 19:13.342
She was such a kind woman that her
spirit was glowing with light.

19:15.301 --> 19:16.502
No.

19:17.821 --> 19:18.820
What do you mean, no?

19:18.821 --> 19:20.021
No.

19:20.501 --> 19:21.901
No, you're doing tricking.

19:22.461 --> 19:23.700
What are you talking about?

19:23.701 --> 19:25.819
I'm telling you a story
about my dead grandma.

19:25.820 --> 19:27.620
No, no, no. You're doing, like...

19:27.621 --> 19:28.939
I know it's a gamble here,

19:28.940 --> 19:31.948
but you're doing, like...
you're trying to embarrass me.

19:32.660 --> 19:33.860
Right?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.939
What the fuck is wrong with you?

19:35.940 --> 19:37.140
No.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.298
No, you're tricking, aren't you?

19:40.299 --> 19:41.499
No.

19:51.659 --> 19:53.739
(MUM) Hannah, could you come in here?

19:56.370 --> 19:57.770
We have to talk.

20:00.579 --> 20:02.297
You need to start paying rent.

20:02.298 --> 20:05.337
Obviously you don't think of me as
a friend. You're just using me.

20:05.338 --> 20:09.217
So either you contribute properly
or you be a proper friend.

20:09.218 --> 20:10.576
The choice is yours.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.977
I don't want to be dramatic about it

20:11.978 --> 20:14.616
but I just feel I've got to
start standing up for myself.

20:14.617 --> 20:17.297
Enough is enough, okay?
I won't be walked over.

20:19.897 --> 20:21.374
What have you got to say about that?

20:21.992 --> 20:24.441
My first fight went
better than expected.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.496
Oh, did you win?

20:26.497 --> 20:28.055
No, I did not.

20:28.056 --> 20:29.655
No, of course you didn't.

20:29.656 --> 20:31.215
Yeah, of course not.

20:31.216 --> 20:32.416
What?

20:33.175 --> 20:35.336
Rose, I think I should just move out.

20:37.055 --> 20:38.495
Why would you do that?

20:38.496 --> 20:40.615
I just don't think we're
very good for each other.

20:42.015 --> 20:44.014
I didn't really want you to pay rent.

20:44.015 --> 20:45.174
I know.

20:45.175 --> 20:46.814
Where would you go?

20:46.815 --> 20:48.214
I'll think of something.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.613
Okay. It's good.

20:51.614 --> 20:53.534
If you want to go, you just go, then.

20:54.534 --> 20:57.494
I'm sure you'll easily find
someone much better than me.

21:06.373 --> 21:07.373
How was it?

21:07.374 --> 21:09.972
Yeah, well, so I've got
good news and bad news.

21:09.973 --> 21:12.652
The good news is,
neither of us have HIV.

21:12.653 --> 21:13.652
I want a second opinion.

21:13.653 --> 21:17.091
Ha-ha! The bad news is that he thinks
his grandma glows in the dark.

21:17.092 --> 21:18.771
(LAUGHS) That's a shame.

21:18.772 --> 21:19.772
So that's that done.

21:19.773 --> 21:22.610
But do you remember the boy who's
Aboriginal, which doesn't define him,

21:22.611 --> 21:24.571
but I just need, like, a very
quick way of letting you know

21:24.572 --> 21:25.930
which boy I'm talking about?

21:25.931 --> 21:28.051
We've been chatting,
I invited him out again,

21:28.052 --> 21:29.490
it's going very well, I think,

21:29.491 --> 21:32.650
and I feel very optimistic and
enthusiastic about the future.

21:32.651 --> 21:33.851
- Good.
- Great.

21:33.852 --> 21:36.171
- (GRINDR NOTIFICATION)
- That's him.

21:37.739 --> 21:39.451
He just wants to be friends. So...

21:40.730 --> 21:42.650
Oh, no! Why did I do that, Tom?

21:42.651 --> 21:44.809
No, I need my phone to be
capable of feeling joy!

21:44.810 --> 21:46.249
I'll get some rice!

21:46.250 --> 21:49.970
(LAUGHS)

21:55.369 --> 21:58.368
Hi, I'm Josh. I'm not here. I'm sorry.
Leave a message. Goodbye.

21:58.369 --> 21:59.569
(BEEP!)

21:59.570 --> 22:01.848
I don't want to do this via voice-mail.

22:01.849 --> 22:04.808
It just seems so harsh
saying this like this.

22:04.809 --> 22:08.688
But... okay, Josh...

22:08.689 --> 22:11.048
I've started seeing someone else.

22:12.168 --> 22:14.327
It's new but I like it.

22:14.328 --> 22:16.768
I just... I thought you deserve to know.

22:20.488 --> 22:23.407
Guys! I'm sick of this game.

22:23.408 --> 22:26.926
I know it was my idea but
sometimes I have bad ideas.

22:26.927 --> 22:28.527
I don't like seeking.

22:29.247 --> 22:31.206
I'm lonely!

22:31.207 --> 22:32.367
Guys!

22:32.368 --> 22:35.646
- (CUCKOO CLOCK CHIMES)
- Guys!

22:38.007 --> 22:39.725
- (TAPPING ON DOOR, DOG BARKS)
- Oh, my God.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.845
There's someone at the door.
I don't want to answer it!

22:42.846 --> 22:46.966
(TAPPING CONTINUES, DOG BARKS)

22:50.885 --> 22:52.365
- Hi, Rose.
- Oh, where's Josh?

22:52.366 --> 22:54.044
Why isn't he answering his phone?

22:54.045 --> 22:56.204
I don't know where he is.
I don't know where anyone is.

22:56.205 --> 22:58.684
- Oh, Josh!
- Josh!

22:58.685 --> 23:00.564
You'd better come out now.

23:00.565 --> 23:02.843
Your mum's here and she is very upset

23:02.844 --> 23:04.604
that you've been ignoring her calls.

23:05.844 --> 23:06.964
I already looked in there.

23:06.965 --> 23:08.683
Where is he? What's he doing?

23:08.684 --> 23:12.723
Well, we're playing hide-and-seek,
but they take it too seriously!

23:12.724 --> 23:15.683
Now I don't even know
if it's fun anymore.

23:15.684 --> 23:17.242
That's ridiculous.

23:17.243 --> 23:22.602
I tried to talk to Hannah like
you said, and she left, Joshua!

23:22.603 --> 23:24.442
Yeah, Joshua!

23:24.443 --> 23:28.361
I'm going to give you a count
of one to five and then...

23:28.362 --> 23:29.361
One!

23:29.362 --> 23:30.363
This is exciting.

23:30.364 --> 23:32.121
- What happens if you get to five?
- Two!

23:32.122 --> 23:36.361
I tell everybody how much
he loved holding my hand

23:36.362 --> 23:38.321
when he was a teenager.

23:38.322 --> 23:39.619
Three!

23:40.401 --> 23:41.962
Four!

23:43.561 --> 23:44.882
Five!

23:53.561 --> 23:55.079
My phone broke.

23:55.080 --> 23:58.199
That is such a good hiding spot.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.879
I didn't want her to leave, Josh.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.359
I wanted her to change.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.239
Now, what the hell am
I supposed to do now?

24:04.240 --> 24:05.240
I don't know.

24:05.241 --> 24:07.039
Why did you tell me to talk to her?

24:07.040 --> 24:09.478
I don't know. It's just what
people say to do, isn't it?

24:09.479 --> 24:11.680
- Get out of there.
- Okay.

24:14.759 --> 24:16.838
- What?
- Well, I'm stuck, aren't I?

24:16.839 --> 24:19.838
- You are not.
- I am! (LAUGHS) I'm very stuck.

24:19.839 --> 24:23.028
No, you're just saying that so you can
divert attention from me. Now get out!

24:23.030 --> 24:27.117
Mum, sometimes I wonder if I'll ever do
anything that'll make you proud of me.

24:27.118 --> 24:28.677
(TOM) I win!

24:28.678 --> 24:29.821
Tom!
